00:02.560 --> 00:05.090
NARRATOR: Previously, on Stargate SG-1.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.830
VALA: Unfortunately, that ship is now
in the hands of the Lucian AIIiance.

00:08.940 --> 00:11.430
-The who?
-It's a coalition

00:11.540 --> 00:15.030
of former smugglers and mercenaries
who've banded together

00:15.140 --> 00:18.700
to take advantage of the power vacuum
left by the demise of the Goa'uld.

00:18.810 --> 00:22.040
We received a communiquÃ©
from a Goa'uld named Nerus.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.140
Ring any bells?

00:23.250 --> 00:27.350
He is a Goa'uld known
for his many appetites.

00:30.490 --> 00:32.390
I was the one who figured out

00:32.490 --> 00:35.730
how to activate all the stargates
in the galaxy at once.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.600
Didn't Ba'al mention that?

00:38.700 --> 00:44.430
You will descend to a small, dark room
in the basement of Area 51,

00:44.540 --> 00:48.530
and you'll stay there till you come up
with a defense against the Ori.

00:48.640 --> 00:52.010
What would possibly compel me
to do that?

00:52.680 --> 00:53.840
Hunger.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.350
(GUNS FIRING)

01:08.760 --> 01:12.760
-What did you say to them?
-Look, obviously it didn't go so well.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.260
I did advise that you are a most unlikely
drug smuggler, Colonel Mitchell.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.810
Can we please just fall back to the gate?

01:39.790 --> 01:41.660
We cannot hold this position.

01:46.070 --> 01:47.900
What's taking so long?

01:48.500 --> 01:52.460
Guys! We got a problem!

01:52.570 --> 01:54.940
Yes, bad men are shooting at us!

01:56.280 --> 01:58.770
Just hurry up and open the damn...

02:06.290 --> 02:07.350
gate.

03:20.460 --> 03:21.720
JACKSON: It's called kassa.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.120
It looks a lot like corn.

03:24.230 --> 03:26.360
Which I always thought was
indigenous to North America.

03:26.470 --> 03:29.370
It must be pretty damn tasty
if it's causing all this fuss.

03:29.470 --> 03:33.410
I believe Lieutenant Mooney described it
as "sweet corn heaven."

03:33.510 --> 03:36.740
-What's his condition?
-He's still craving it, sir.

03:37.210 --> 03:40.700
He didn't even want to leave the planet.
I had to restrain him to get him back here.

03:40.820 --> 03:41.780
It's amazing.

03:41.880 --> 03:45.720
Obviously you never had my grandma's
corn bread and black-eyed peas.

03:46.250 --> 03:49.090
No. What about the rest of the population?

03:49.190 --> 03:51.220
Were they demonstrating any
of the same addictive behaviors?

03:51.330 --> 03:53.920
Everybody was fine
when we first got there.

03:54.030 --> 03:56.760
A fight broke out in the marketplace
when supplies ran low,

03:56.870 --> 03:59.030
and my men and I had to move in
to restore order.

03:59.130 --> 04:02.260
That's what made Mooney
want a taste in the first place.

04:02.970 --> 04:05.840
-I just didn't think it would...
-LANDRY: It's all right.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.810
What does Dr. Lee have to say about it?

04:07.910 --> 04:09.640
He's still analyzing the sample now, sir,

04:09.740 --> 04:11.970
to determine whether or not
it's naturally occurring.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.610
Which makes me wonder if the Ori
have something to do with this.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.410
Get all the population jonesing
for space corn.

04:19.220 --> 04:20.520
I don't know.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.020
I also do not believe that to be likely.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.920
I guess it doesn't really fit
their M.O., does it?

04:25.030 --> 04:28.150
Besides, there was no evidence
that a Prior had ever been there before.

04:28.260 --> 04:31.320
In the last session of the interim council,
several Jaffa leaders complained

04:31.430 --> 04:34.300
of erratic behavior on several planets.

04:34.670 --> 04:36.970
We did not suspect
tampering with the food supply.

04:37.070 --> 04:40.470
Colonel, were you able to determine
where this kassa came from?

04:40.740 --> 04:42.680
I pressured one of the vendors
for a gate address,

04:42.780 --> 04:45.140
but to be honest,
I don't know if it's accurate.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.080
It's worth checking out, sir.

04:47.180 --> 04:50.120
Find out what you can,
but try to stay under the radar.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.240
MlTCHELL: Will do.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.130
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

05:28.990 --> 05:30.820
Taste-testing the produce, huh?

05:32.090 --> 05:34.320
Please, I have two daughters.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.560
Don't worry, we're not gonna hurt you.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.830
Who are you? What do you want?

05:39.330 --> 05:43.430
-We're looking to buy some kassa.
-lt is available at every market.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.960
We're looking for a sizable quantity.

05:49.940 --> 05:52.440
I can maybe spare you
one or two carts full.

05:53.310 --> 05:55.180
How much for the whole field?

05:56.650 --> 05:58.450
This is not the way
the Alliance does business.

05:58.550 --> 06:00.820
As in the Lucian Alliance?

06:00.990 --> 06:04.020
-What other alliances do we know?
-Many.

06:05.530 --> 06:07.260
The Lucian Alliance
will know you've come.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.560
They have eyes everywhere.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.690
Great, because we're looking
to set up a meeting.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.560
Maybe you can arrange that.

06:13.970 --> 06:17.200
-Worrel returns this afternoon.
-Worrel is...

06:17.740 --> 06:21.640
This is his land, his crop.
He lives in a house just up the road.

06:21.840 --> 06:25.400
Tell him Mr. Shaft
would like to meet with him.

06:26.080 --> 06:30.070
Any specific time, or should I just
block off the whole afternoon?

06:30.290 --> 06:34.480
I will arrange it, but I must warn you
he will not take kindly to your request

06:35.120 --> 06:36.680
or to your presence.

06:45.570 --> 06:46.530
(CLEARING THROAT)

06:47.240 --> 06:49.100
What the hell was that?

06:49.670 --> 06:52.610
-What was what?
-We're supposed to stay under the radar.

06:52.710 --> 06:54.970
I doubt if this world
possesses such technology.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.870
-See? When he's right, he's right.
-Sam has a point.

06:56.980 --> 06:58.450
We're not equipped
to take these guys on right now.

06:58.550 --> 07:02.610
I have no intention of taking anybody on.
I'm just gonna pose as a buyer.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.450
-You?
-Well, no offense, Jackson,

07:04.550 --> 07:06.650
but you do not strike me
as the drug dealer type.

07:06.750 --> 07:07.810
In fact, you're not even close.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.910
-I think I'm as close as you are.
-Come on, you're miles away.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.150
Teal'c, which one of us is closer?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.930
I believe the three of you
to be equidistant.

07:16.030 --> 07:18.560
Oh, please!
Mary Poppins is not even in the running.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.220
-Hey!
-And neither are you,

07:21.400 --> 07:22.840
because I'm going.

07:23.910 --> 07:27.310
I'm just gonna ask some questions
about the operation,

07:28.210 --> 07:31.240
find out what I can,
tell them their price is too high

07:31.350 --> 07:33.210
and then hightail it out of there.

07:44.990 --> 07:46.550
CARTER: This was a bad idea.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.760
It's been four hours now.
When do we call this thing?

07:59.110 --> 08:00.600
They are heavily armed.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.220
This is the man I told you about. Mr. Shaft.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.290
Hey.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.850
You must be Worrel.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.220
Where are your friends, mister?

08:20.500 --> 08:23.760
I figured you'd rather deal one-on-one.
Call me Shaft.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.490
Who told you kassa was grown here?

08:27.600 --> 08:30.300
In my business,
you get to know the right people.

08:30.410 --> 08:34.240
-What right people?
-You know, the good, hard-working type.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.240
Tell you what you wanna know,
then disappear.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.350
You can go.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.150
We'll talk inside.

08:54.700 --> 08:55.660
Right.

08:58.070 --> 09:01.870
-lf we remain here, we will be discovered.
-Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

09:14.950 --> 09:18.210
-Fellas, do you think I'd carry a weapon?
-Enough.

09:20.420 --> 09:22.980
All right, mister, what can I do for you?

09:24.830 --> 09:27.660
I represent a coalition of seven planets

09:27.760 --> 09:31.790
with a combined population
of 30 million kassa-hungry souls.

09:32.230 --> 09:35.760
-We're looking for a supplier.
-I don't have that kind of inventory.

09:35.870 --> 09:38.070
No, nobody does,
that's why I need more than one.

09:38.170 --> 09:39.370
So, if you could just refer me...

09:39.470 --> 09:41.030
-Refer you?
-Higher up.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.910
So, you wish to speak to my superior?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.270
I think our needs are big enough
to warrant his attention.

09:49.620 --> 09:50.950
Your needs.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.390
Oh, that didn't look good.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.890
-Just exactly who do you think you are?
-I already told you my name.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.090
Mister.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.660
Actually, it's just Shaft.
Mister is more of a courtesy title.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.230
So if you could just pass it along
to your superiors, that's all I'm asking.

10:09.340 --> 10:11.600
I'm forced to wonder
what someone like yourself,

10:11.710 --> 10:13.830
a businessman representing...

10:13.940 --> 10:15.770
-How many planets did you say again?
-Seven,

10:15.880 --> 10:17.470
but one of them is actually a moon, so...

10:17.580 --> 10:20.310
So, 30 million potential customers,

10:20.650 --> 10:23.550
and you need me
to arrange a meeting with my superior.

10:23.650 --> 10:26.780
See, now, you're selling yourself short.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.490
Yeah, I think he's in trouble.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.330
As are we.

10:58.420 --> 10:59.890
(GUNS FIRING)

11:09.760 --> 11:13.830
-What did you say to them?
-Look, obviously it didn't go so well.

11:39.230 --> 11:40.190
Guys!

11:40.290 --> 11:42.020
What's taking so long?

11:44.330 --> 11:45.630
We got a problem.

11:45.730 --> 11:47.790
Just hurry up and open the damn...

11:51.770 --> 11:52.860
gate.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.170
Okay, here's an obvious question.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.300
You're surrounded! Drop your weapons!

12:37.250 --> 12:38.650
HARRlMAN: Chevron four encoded.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.120
-Chief, how long are they overdue now?
-Two hours, sir.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.320
Colonel Mitchell's
never missed a check-in.

12:45.490 --> 12:46.930
Chevron five encoded.

12:47.030 --> 12:50.000
General Landry, sir.
I just spoke with Dr. Lee.

12:50.100 --> 12:53.120
He's determined the plant contains
a highly addictive psycho stimulant.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.500
Which just confirms
what we already knew.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.040
But we didn't know it is engineered,
which means it didn't evolve naturally.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.640
Chevron six encoded.

13:07.920 --> 13:10.510
-Chevron seven will not lock.
-Why not?

13:10.620 --> 13:12.920
I don't know, sir. I'm not showing
any malfunction at this end.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.610
-Run a diagnostic and try again.
-Yes, sir.

13:22.060 --> 13:26.060
-The infamous SG-1.
-MlTCHELL: Everybody, this is Worrel.

13:27.030 --> 13:30.230
Trust me, mister.
You won't get the best of me again.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.240
Actually, it's Mitchell. Cameron Mitchell.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.470
I tried to explain the "mister" thing.
I don't think...

13:34.580 --> 13:36.510
How did you steal the stargate?

13:37.040 --> 13:38.030
What?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.710
SG-1 shows up
on my little backwater planet,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.880
and the stargate vanishes. I'm not a fool.

13:44.150 --> 13:47.120
Perhaps not, but we are not responsible.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.950
We were here
on a reconnaissance mission.

13:50.460 --> 13:52.890
So, you were done slaying system lords

13:52.990 --> 13:55.960
and decided to move on
to more pressing agricultural concerns?

13:56.060 --> 13:57.830
That's exactly it. Corn patrol.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.870
(GRUNTS)

14:00.430 --> 14:02.300
JACKSON: Oh, I have a question.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.930
Why would we make
the gate magically disappear

14:05.040 --> 14:07.300
before we had a chance
to escape through it?

14:07.410 --> 14:08.430
Bad timing?

14:08.540 --> 14:10.870
That's gotta be the single
stupidest thing I've ever heard.

14:10.980 --> 14:14.510
Do things always go according
to plan in your world, Dr. Jackson?

14:16.750 --> 14:18.280
No. Not usually, no.

14:18.390 --> 14:21.380
Then I would guess
this is another one of those times.

14:23.620 --> 14:27.790
And until my stargate is returned,
things will continue to go wrong.

14:34.030 --> 14:36.130
We've made repeated attempts
to connect, sir.

14:36.240 --> 14:37.760
There's no signal whatsoever.

14:37.870 --> 14:39.840
It's gotta be a problem
with the offworld gate.

14:39.940 --> 14:41.740
Get me Colonel Emerson
onboard the Odyssey.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.330
Yes, sir, right away.

14:54.190 --> 14:57.120
-Sir, I have General Landry for you.
-Onscreen.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.420
Colonel, how goes the shakedown?

14:59.530 --> 15:02.190
90% of our primary systems
are up and running, sir.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.530
-Care to take a ride?
-Another time.

15:04.630 --> 15:08.260
I just need you to tell me
that your hyperdrive is part of that 90%.

15:08.370 --> 15:10.800
We've Iost contact with SG-1.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.640
They were on P6G-452.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.140
Estimate 22 hours, sir.

15:16.740 --> 15:19.870
I wouldn't wanna go into battle just yet,
but I think we can reach 452

15:19.980 --> 15:23.040
-and extract SG-1 inside of a day.
-GIad to hear it.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.410
I assume they have
the new locator chip implants.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.220
They were the first,
after the events on Tegalus.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.350
I can't think of a better
first operational mission

15:30.460 --> 15:32.150
for the Odysseythan to bring home SG-1.

15:32.260 --> 15:35.790
-Neither can I, Colonel. Good Iuck.
-Thank you, sir.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.420
Landry out.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.830
-Major Marks, set a course for P6G-452.
-Yes, sir.

15:43.740 --> 15:47.870
Attention all decks. This is Emerson.
Prepare to engage hyperdrive.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.000
-Take us out.
-With pleasure, sir.

16:05.660 --> 16:06.630
(GRUNTS)

16:06.930 --> 16:09.190
Seriously, why would we take
the stargate away

16:09.300 --> 16:10.960
before we had a chance
to escape through it?

16:11.070 --> 16:12.930
And don't say "bad timing."

16:13.370 --> 16:16.800
Are things continuing
to go wrong for you, Dr. Jackson?

16:17.870 --> 16:19.640
It's within your power to change that.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.440
Torturing us is not gonna get you
the answer you're looking for.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.740
I don't wanna torture you.

16:24.850 --> 16:27.040
In fact, if you tell me
the location of the stargate,

16:27.150 --> 16:28.410
I'm prepared to release you.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.780
Oh, you are not!
Can you believe he just said that?

16:32.890 --> 16:36.380
You've already blown your chance.
Whoever took your stargate is long gone.

16:36.490 --> 16:40.480
And when your superiors discover
that you have let the real thieves escape,

16:41.430 --> 16:43.120
it is you who will be tortured.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.030
Someone is stealing stargates?

16:49.140 --> 16:52.040
Well, four that we know of, sir,
according to the Tok'ra dispatch.

16:52.140 --> 16:56.370
Which could explain why we haven't
been able to dial 452 and contact SG-1.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.470
Exactly, sir.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.240
In fact, the Trust
tried this once with our gate.

17:00.350 --> 17:02.610
Isn't any Goa'uld mother ship

17:02.720 --> 17:05.310
or a similar-class vessel
capable of taking a gate?

17:05.420 --> 17:07.080
Not with Asgard beaming technology,

17:07.190 --> 17:10.160
which one eyewitness apparently
confirmed is the method being used.

17:10.260 --> 17:13.160
Send an encrypted data-burst
of all available intel

17:13.260 --> 17:15.020
to Colonel Emerson onboard the Odyssey.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.860
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, and, Chief,

17:17.230 --> 17:21.530
call Peterson Air Base.
I need to take a little trip to Area 51.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.200
Right away, sir.

17:34.210 --> 17:35.180
(DOOR BUZZING)

17:41.320 --> 17:42.520
General.

17:42.860 --> 17:46.090
They told me you were coming,
but I didn't believe them.

17:46.430 --> 17:49.090
I said, "l don't believe you."

17:50.860 --> 17:52.420
Well, here I am.

17:56.540 --> 18:01.470
You come to visit
a condemned prisoner empty-handed?

18:01.680 --> 18:04.340
You're not a condemned prisoner, Nerus.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.250
But if you tell me what I need to know,

18:10.620 --> 18:12.920
I'll arrange a feast,

18:13.550 --> 18:16.790
the likes of which you have not seen
since you set foot on this planet.

18:17.620 --> 18:18.850
(WHISPERING) Feast?

18:19.230 --> 18:21.560
I do not use the word lightly.

18:22.730 --> 18:23.960
Nor do l.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.430
How may I be of service, my dear General?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.100
Someone out there is stealing stargates.

18:31.340 --> 18:35.070
-I need to know who, how and why.
-Stealing them?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.710
Beamed right off the planets with
Asgard technology, as far as we know.

18:38.810 --> 18:41.010
Well, that must be maddening for you.

18:43.050 --> 18:44.180
It is.

18:46.990 --> 18:48.890
I already have an idea who it might be.

18:48.990 --> 18:51.720
Well, if you're so smart,
what do you need me for?

18:51.830 --> 18:54.660
I have a theory. I still need some answers.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.490
But such a quandary
must be worth more to you

18:57.600 --> 19:00.570
than a single, solitary indulgent meal.

19:00.670 --> 19:05.870
Perhaps we could discuss my dietary
requirements on a more permanent...

19:05.970 --> 19:09.370
Every minute you waste
trying to negotiate,

19:09.880 --> 19:12.070
I take one item off the menu.

19:15.550 --> 19:17.680
Can we talk over appetizers?

19:25.190 --> 19:26.390
General!

19:38.010 --> 19:42.070
Look, for what it's worth, guys,
sorry I dragged you into this.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.110
Oh, it happens all the time.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.240
MlTCHELL: Worrel, my friend.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.390
You wear the furrowed brow
of a deeply worried man.

19:57.660 --> 19:59.060
How's your day going?

19:59.160 --> 20:01.350
We've been recalled by the Alliance.

20:01.460 --> 20:04.730
Well, you can't say we didn't tell you so.

20:04.830 --> 20:06.990
It is far worse news for you.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.660
I no longer have any reason
to keep you alive.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.300
(STAMMERING) No, wait.
I can think of a reason.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.140
We're more valuable alive.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.840
Yes, we're more valuable alive. Good one.

20:22.050 --> 20:23.040
No.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.240
My instructions were quite clear.

20:27.490 --> 20:32.190
Take care of Mr. Shaft last.
I want him to watch the others go first.

20:33.960 --> 20:36.120
Your deaths will serve
as a warning to your people

20:36.230 --> 20:39.220
never to meddle with our operations
in the future.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.110
General,

20:54.650 --> 20:58.280
this chicken is most plump and delicious!

20:58.390 --> 21:00.180
You spoil me, General!

21:00.290 --> 21:02.380
-It's called turkey.
-Turkey?

21:02.490 --> 21:04.320
Another rare delicacy.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.790
Well, I must have more turkey!

21:09.660 --> 21:12.660
-What's this?
-I'm losing patience, Nerus.

21:12.770 --> 21:15.560
-Well, you already know who it is.
-So, it is Ba'al?

21:15.670 --> 21:18.230
Of course, it's Ba'al. Who else would it be?

21:18.340 --> 21:19.900
Why is he doing it?

21:20.770 --> 21:23.040
You're the genius. You tell me.

21:23.540 --> 21:27.310
Maybe there's no need to go
into the third and fourth courses.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.920
No, General. No, no, no.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.490
I meant that as
the most sincere form of flattery.

21:32.590 --> 21:34.880
You are one of the more
intelligent human beings

21:34.990 --> 21:36.790
I've ever had the pleasure of meeting,

21:36.890 --> 21:42.520
and I assure you, General,
that this meal has just begun.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.630
I'm glad to hear that.

21:50.900 --> 21:52.900
Hey, the other three had nothing
to do with this.

21:53.010 --> 21:55.370
-I was running the operation.
-Cam.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.270
Worrel knows this.
Tell him to get back here.

22:07.820 --> 22:11.310
SG-1, I'm Colonel Paul Emerson.

22:13.030 --> 22:14.650
Welcome aboard the Odyssey.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.760
Thank you, sir.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.350
-How about that timing, Jackson?
-Good timing.

22:19.530 --> 22:23.490
Airman, let's get these people out
of these bindings and to the infirmary.

22:35.750 --> 22:36.740
MlTCHELL: Sir.

22:36.850 --> 22:38.780
I know you people have been
through a lot.

22:38.890 --> 22:40.850
MlTCHELL: We'll live. Hand it over.

22:41.420 --> 22:44.790
We received this intel
from Stargate Command a few hours ago.

22:47.530 --> 22:49.290
Damn, Ba'al's been busy.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.850
He's been gathering up stargates from all
over the sector for the last several weeks.

22:52.970 --> 22:54.900
Yeah, we saw one of them disappear.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.160
Do we know why?

22:56.270 --> 22:58.530
Not yet. Nor do we know where he is.

22:58.640 --> 23:00.830
What of the Lucian Alliance?

23:00.940 --> 23:03.970
For the moment, General Landry
considers this our top priority.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.940
Where's he getting his intel?

23:07.110 --> 23:08.240
Nerus.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.480
Oh, jim-dandy.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.420
Such intelligence
cannot be considered reliable.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.320
I'm not sure.
Nerus did work for Ba'al for centuries.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.260
It's a good place as any to start.

23:19.360 --> 23:22.350
And General Landry can be
pretty persuasive when he needs to be.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.130
LANDRY: Nerus, you have
the most atrocious

23:26.230 --> 23:28.220
table manners of any person I've ever met.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.890
General, please.

23:30.640 --> 23:35.510
You forget that despite appearances,
I'm not human.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.200
Oh, my goodness.
Why does Ba'al want a dozen stargates?

23:43.380 --> 23:44.510
Nerus?

23:46.090 --> 23:47.350
Dessert!

23:47.650 --> 23:48.620
(CHUCKLING)

23:48.760 --> 23:51.320
Young man,
you have positively read my mind.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.020
Come in, come in.

23:53.930 --> 23:56.230
Make room for dessert.

23:56.830 --> 23:58.800
Just put... Oh, what are...

24:01.940 --> 24:05.530
Individually frosted cakes!

24:08.340 --> 24:12.340
Well, you're so clever, you figured out
the perpetrator, what do you think?

24:12.450 --> 24:16.440
We assume he intends to offer them
back to the planets he's stolen them from

24:16.550 --> 24:19.210
in exchange for some form of payment.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.250
You're not very intelligent,
are you, General?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.820
Sorry to disappoint you.

24:23.460 --> 24:25.890
Well, you're just thinking too small,
that's all.

24:25.990 --> 24:28.360
You've got to think more like a Goa'uld.

24:32.300 --> 24:33.730
What is it

24:34.840 --> 24:36.930
that Ba'al once had?

24:38.840 --> 24:40.200
Think of it.

24:41.170 --> 24:45.440
Now think of what he has lost.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.050
-He's starting over.
-Precisely.

24:50.180 --> 24:52.780
See? There's still hope for you yet.

24:54.350 --> 24:59.550
See, some time ago, Ba'al came to me
looking for a way to rebuild

24:59.730 --> 25:04.630
in the event that the Jaffa ever succeeded
in conquering the Goa'uld.

25:04.730 --> 25:08.100
Now, I had been studying
the stargate system for months.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.360
To help you defeat
the Replicators, incidentally.

25:11.740 --> 25:17.180
And I stumbled upon a way
to disable the correlative update program.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.940
So you could move a stargate

25:19.050 --> 25:21.910
and not have it transmit its new position
to the rest of the network.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.350
Precisely.

25:23.450 --> 25:28.390
So it would seem that Ba'al
has put my research into practice.

25:28.490 --> 25:30.820
Which leads us to where?

25:30.920 --> 25:34.550
I have a theory, General,

25:34.660 --> 25:39.600
but no assortment of cheeses,

25:40.470 --> 25:44.900
however delicious,
could possibly compel me to tell you that.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.040
What did you have in mind?

25:47.210 --> 25:49.330
-My freedom.
-Absolutely not.

25:51.110 --> 25:55.780
Once he has set the program,
it will be impossible to detect.

25:56.350 --> 25:59.150
Your freedom
just isn't on the table, Nerus.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.720
But I'm sure there is something else
we can offer.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.410
My dear General,

26:05.160 --> 26:09.620
I rarely say this,
so please take it to heart when I say

26:10.460 --> 26:14.130
that for the moment, I'm full.

26:37.020 --> 26:40.580
-What were you thinking, Worrel?
-Please don't kill me.

26:40.690 --> 26:42.530
And why would I do that?

26:42.630 --> 26:44.790
The last time I heard you say that
to someone, they...

26:44.900 --> 26:47.160
I'm just stunned
that you would honestly believe

26:47.270 --> 26:51.570
that SG-1 would steal the gate
and trap themselves on the planet.

26:51.870 --> 26:53.270
Well, l...

26:54.070 --> 26:57.810
You had them for almost two days,
and you learned nothing.

26:59.550 --> 27:02.640
And now two-thirds
of our crop will rot uselessly.

27:02.750 --> 27:05.620
-lf we could bring in cargo ships...
-Cargo ships?

27:08.290 --> 27:10.760
You have any idea
how many it would actually take?

27:10.990 --> 27:13.150
I promise I will avenge this.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.060
Don't worry about SG-1 and Earth.

27:17.860 --> 27:22.460
They're of little consequence.
We have spies all over the galaxy.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.240
Find out who really took the stargate
and get it back.

27:31.810 --> 27:34.340
Or don't bother returning yourself.

27:35.350 --> 27:36.610
Yes, Netan.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.680
-Oh, well.
-LANDRY: I trust you're all packed.

27:44.790 --> 27:48.730
Yes, with a sizable assortment of...
What do you call them?

27:48.830 --> 27:49.920
Cupcakes.

27:50.030 --> 27:54.730
Yes! A most generous point
to concede in our negotiation, General.

27:54.830 --> 27:57.460
-Consider it a going-away present.
-Well, I'm touched.

27:57.570 --> 28:01.370
Yes, well, I admit it took some convincing.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.240
Well, superiors can sometimes be difficult.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.940
They do have reason not to trust you.

28:08.620 --> 28:13.480
Yes, but you did convince them
that it was a fair bargain.

28:14.290 --> 28:16.980
Me giving the coordinates for my freedom.

28:18.690 --> 28:22.790
Unless, of course,
you don't intend to honor...

28:22.900 --> 28:25.190
I think you know by now
I'm a man of my word.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.970
Well, yes, of course you are.

28:28.070 --> 28:30.730
Then you should have
no trouble believing me when I say

28:30.840 --> 28:32.670
that if you're lying
about these coordinates,

28:32.770 --> 28:35.370
there will be nowhere
in this galaxy for you to hide.

28:35.710 --> 28:37.940
-Oh, I believe you.
-I'm glad.

28:40.610 --> 28:41.840
Farewell.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.120
(WHOOSHING)

28:54.830 --> 28:55.920
Putz.

28:58.700 --> 29:03.570
-Should I dial the coordinates he left, sir?
-No, it's probably a black hole or worse.

29:03.670 --> 29:07.040
If I've learned one thing in this command,
it's never to trust a Goa'uld.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.630
Especially if his name is Nerus.

29:10.340 --> 29:11.470
Yes, sir.

29:20.520 --> 29:21.750
Come in.

29:22.090 --> 29:25.180
Sir, we're picking up a subspace signal
from the beacon.

29:25.290 --> 29:28.020
-That was fast.
-Yes, sir. Looks like you were right.

29:28.130 --> 29:31.560
-He went back to Ba'al.
-Send the coordinates to Odyssey, ASAP.

29:31.670 --> 29:32.890
Yes, sir.

29:33.970 --> 29:35.430
Sir, if you don't mind my asking...

29:35.540 --> 29:38.130
How did we plant the beacon on Nerus?

29:38.670 --> 29:39.900
Yes, sir.

29:40.340 --> 29:42.210
It was a piece of cake.

29:54.290 --> 29:57.920
Sir, I'm receiving a subspace
transmission from SGC.

29:58.530 --> 30:00.960
-It's a set of coordinates.
-Ba'al.

30:01.490 --> 30:03.590
General Landry's indeed persuasive.

30:04.430 --> 30:06.300
Colonel, is the Odyssey ready to fight?

30:06.400 --> 30:08.130
Our shields have only been tested
in simulations,

30:08.230 --> 30:10.430
but our weapons
and navigation are online.

30:10.540 --> 30:12.200
Let's take him down.

30:27.250 --> 30:28.520
How nice!

30:29.090 --> 30:32.060
You came to greet me in person.

30:32.160 --> 30:36.250
Oh, I have this fabulous innovation
I want you to...

30:36.360 --> 30:39.630
It's called a cupcake. It's so good.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.070
Why have you returned?

30:44.070 --> 30:46.500
My old friend, you wound me deeply.

30:46.610 --> 30:49.540
I'm capable of wounding you
much more deeply.

30:50.840 --> 30:53.810
I thought you made yourself
quite comfortable with the Tau'ri...

30:53.910 --> 30:55.510
Or was it the Ori?

30:57.080 --> 31:01.880
You actually believe
that I would defect to the Ori?

31:03.620 --> 31:05.750
No, no, no.

31:05.860 --> 31:08.950
It was a temporary
lapse of judgment, I admit,

31:09.060 --> 31:14.590
but I have never in my life

31:14.700 --> 31:20.300
ever wavered one iota
in my devotion for you, sire.

31:25.850 --> 31:27.610
Are you certain you were not followed?

31:29.550 --> 31:31.480
I am a genius, you know.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.950
So you insist.

31:34.050 --> 31:38.550
Yes, and so I have proven in my service
to you time and time again.

31:40.230 --> 31:43.390
Do you know how many stargates
I had to go through to get here?

31:43.900 --> 31:45.130
Five stargates!

31:45.230 --> 31:49.000
And that kind and naive General
promised me...

31:49.100 --> 31:52.540
Anyway, he gave me his word
that he wouldn't follow me.

31:54.910 --> 31:57.900
If you wish to return to my court, Nerus,
you shall have to prove yourself.

31:58.010 --> 31:59.500
-How?
-Find me planets

31:59.610 --> 32:02.210
suitable for my new empire.
I am ready to begin anew.

32:02.320 --> 32:08.080
Well, first I must recover
from my harrowing ordeal.

32:10.090 --> 32:12.560
It would be wise not to defy me, Nerus.

32:13.990 --> 32:17.050
Things have changed
considerably since you left.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.460
From what little we know of Ba'al's ship,

32:24.570 --> 32:27.510
there's only one cargo hold
big enough to store the stargates.

32:27.610 --> 32:28.600
That's here.

32:28.710 --> 32:32.140
We beam onto the ship,
make our way to the cargo hold

32:32.250 --> 32:33.940
and tag the gates with these suckers.

32:34.050 --> 32:35.070
Locator beacons.

32:35.180 --> 32:36.440
CARTER: They only operate
through subspace,

32:36.550 --> 32:37.610
so they shouldn't be detected.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.910
Once we lock onto their signal,
we beam back the gates,

32:40.020 --> 32:43.010
beam ourselves out and hopefully
be gone before Ba'al knows the difference.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.720
But won't Ba'al be able
to detect the Odyssey?

32:45.830 --> 32:48.560
And even if they don't,
how do you beam through shields?

32:48.660 --> 32:50.930
Let's just say that's been taken
into consideration.

33:08.650 --> 33:09.910
(RUMBLING)

33:10.820 --> 33:12.080
Oh, dear.

33:13.290 --> 33:17.420
General Landry had Dr. Lee program
a virus into several of Nerus' devices.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.490
As soon as he interfaces
one of them with the ship,

33:19.590 --> 33:22.890
it should kill all their systems.
Shields, sensors, weapons.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.900
WOMAN ON P.A. SYSTEM:
Colonel Emerson, this is flight deck.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.490
We're coming out ofhyperspace now, sir.

33:26.600 --> 33:28.360
Understood. We're on our way.

33:34.140 --> 33:35.940
Ba'al's ship should be dead ahead, sir.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.870
-Have they detected us?
-Negative, sir,

33:37.980 --> 33:40.540
but I am receiving
a subspace locator code.

33:40.650 --> 33:43.010
It was programed to transmit
when the virus went active.

33:43.120 --> 33:45.050
Nerus didn't waste time, for a change.

33:48.190 --> 33:51.250
-What is happening?
-All our systems have failed.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.060
How can that be?

33:54.230 --> 33:56.630
I have limited power back online.

33:57.200 --> 34:00.930
Looks like the systems are being disrupted
from within the ship.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.680
Come with me.

34:35.600 --> 34:36.830
This way.

34:41.510 --> 34:42.740
(WHISPERING) We're in.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.670
Understood. We will hold the station
within beaming range.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.250
Oh, hello.

34:58.490 --> 35:02.890
Oh, it's just a teeny-tiny virus.
I'm sure I can eradicate it in short order.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.930
As soon as I can get control
of the terminal.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.930
General, you're a lot more devious
than I thought you were.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.260
You disappoint me.

35:11.370 --> 35:15.360
(STAMMERING) I'll keep you informed.
Thank you.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.820
Oh, here you are again.

35:30.220 --> 35:34.490
Well, I don't think that shooting
the console will help,

35:34.590 --> 35:35.960
but you can try.

35:37.230 --> 35:38.630
Oh, I see.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.100
I don't suppose there's anything I can say.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.810
But I'm so interesting.

36:18.070 --> 36:19.270
(BEEPING)

36:26.080 --> 36:27.600
We have an intruder on the ship.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.650
Oh, boy.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.750
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

36:37.860 --> 36:40.690
-nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
-We're gonna need more locators.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.060
Colonel Mitchell.

36:50.840 --> 36:52.030
Company.

36:54.610 --> 36:55.700
Ideas?

37:12.160 --> 37:13.890
Houston, we have a problem.

37:13.990 --> 37:15.460
What is it?

37:16.230 --> 37:19.130
Sir, another three mother ships
just dropped out of hyperspace.

37:19.230 --> 37:21.430
-What?
-lntercepting a hail, sir.

37:21.530 --> 37:24.800
NETAN: Ha'tak vessel,
this is Netan of the Lucian AIIiance.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.430
Surrender now, or you will be destroyed.

37:39.350 --> 37:41.720
Lucian Alliance, this is Colonel Emerson,

37:41.820 --> 37:44.350
commander of the Earth vessel Odyssey.
Please respond.

37:44.460 --> 37:48.690
Sir, they've powered up weapons.
Target appears to be Ba'al's ship.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.430
SG-1, this is Odyssey. What's your status?

38:01.640 --> 38:03.370
Jackson, a little help!

38:08.480 --> 38:10.570
Our position has been compromised!

38:10.680 --> 38:13.170
We are attempting
to proceed with the mission!

38:13.290 --> 38:15.650
Be advised.
The Lucian Alliance just showed up.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.020
You can't go up against all of them
with an untested ship.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.650
EMERSON: They're targeting Ba 'al's ship.
We gotta get you out of there now.

38:20.760 --> 38:23.060
That's a negative,
I'm still tagging the gates.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.260
Colonel, without shields, Ba 'al's ship
won 't be able to withstand anything.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.490
We know, thank you. SG-1 out.

38:38.680 --> 38:39.870
Status?

38:42.010 --> 38:44.780
Managed to restore sensors
and communications.

38:44.880 --> 38:47.280
Detecting four other ships
in close proximity.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.980
-What?
-We're being hailed.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.190
Put them onscreen.

38:55.390 --> 38:58.060
This is Netan of the Lucian AIIiance.

38:58.430 --> 39:02.990
You have cargo that belongs to us.
You will surrender it and your ship now.

39:03.100 --> 39:05.730
You are in no position
to make such demands.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.500
You have no shields and no weapons.

39:08.610 --> 39:11.370
Surrender immediately
or prepare to be boarded.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.410
Go ahead and try.

39:16.180 --> 39:20.020
Fire on them.
Target weapons and hyperdrive engines.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.790
Get me my shields!

39:30.100 --> 39:32.760
Sir, the Lucian Alliance vessel
has opened fire.

39:32.870 --> 39:34.700
SG-1, stand by for extraction.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.100
Attaching the last beacon now. Go!

39:39.210 --> 39:40.430
Activating transport.

39:46.950 --> 39:48.780
I've managed to restore shields.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.080
Sir, we've got a problem.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.410
Ba'al's shields just went back up.
You're gonna have to sit tight.

39:54.520 --> 39:57.350
We can't sit for long! Fall back!

40:12.270 --> 40:13.360
Bring us about.

40:13.470 --> 40:16.000
Captain, fire forward rail guns
at the lead ship.

40:17.580 --> 40:19.170
Looks like we're gonna
be testing our shields.

40:28.290 --> 40:31.720
-Evasive. Report.
-Shields are holding, but down 1 1%, sir.

40:31.890 --> 40:33.620
The Lucian Alliance ship
shows minimal damage.

40:33.730 --> 40:35.490
What about Ba'al's ship?
Can we get them out of there yet?

40:35.590 --> 40:36.620
Negative, sir.

40:37.860 --> 40:39.160
Last mag.

40:41.370 --> 40:43.840
We need to find another way off this boat.

40:47.340 --> 40:49.370
-Carter?
-I have an idea.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.700
-Nice.
-TEAL'C: Jaffa.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.140
Covering fire!

40:57.050 --> 40:59.780
Forget weapons.
Bring our hyperdrive online.

41:02.020 --> 41:04.220
My Lord,
I'm showing imminent shield failure.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.850
-Sir, Ba'al's ship just lost shields.
-Get them out of there now.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.190
Hangar deck, report.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.290
MAN ON RADIO: Sir,
we've got all the gates but one.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.090
We couldn 't get a Iock on its beacon.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.500
-What about SG-1?
-Negative, sir.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.100
Ba'al's ship has been destroyed.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.980
Concentrate all weapons fire
on the Earth vessel.

41:32.080 --> 41:35.450
All three Lucian Alliance vessels
are targeting us now, sir.

41:36.820 --> 41:38.410
Engage hyperdrive.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.600
I'm glad to see you.

41:58.710 --> 42:01.410
I'm a little surprised
to see you come through the gate.

42:01.510 --> 42:04.280
Colonel Carter successfully reprogrammed
one of the DHDs

42:04.380 --> 42:06.720
in Ba'al's cargo hold
so that we could, in fact, escape.

42:06.820 --> 42:08.720
-Well done.
-With your permission, sir,

42:08.820 --> 42:10.580
we should let Odyssey know
that we're okay.

42:10.690 --> 42:12.950
-They probably fear the worst.
-The worst?

42:13.060 --> 42:16.260
That we were blown up in Ba'al's ship
when the Lucian Alliance attacked, sir.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.090
So, the stargates were destroyed.

42:18.200 --> 42:21.690
No, hopefully the Odyssey managed
to beam the gates off in time.

42:22.270 --> 42:25.830
An eventful few days. Debrief in one hour.

42:28.240 --> 42:31.370
We have got the best jobs
in the world, don't we?

42:31.610 --> 42:33.510
I'm gonna hit the shower.

42:34.180 --> 42:36.110
I'm gonna find a doctor.

42:37.420 --> 42:39.410
We are indeed suitably employed.

42:42.890 --> 42:44.820
Yeah, it was a good day.
