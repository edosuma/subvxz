let's face the facts.

15:19.675 --> 15:21.484
He was never our friend.

15:22.945 --> 15:24.151
We've all done the math.

15:24.313 --> 15:26.418
Speedy was abducted
before any of us met.

15:26.582 --> 15:29.392
You're the guy we trained beside,
fought beside.

15:29.552 --> 15:32.294
You're the only you we know.

15:32.655 --> 15:33.855
You're our friend.

15:33.956 --> 15:37.529
Just because you're a clone with anger
management issues doesn't change that.

15:37.693 --> 15:40.139
Seriously. Have you met Superboy'?

15:42.898 --> 15:44.536
All done?

15:44.934 --> 15:48.575
You wanna salvage someone's soul,
go get Kaldur to see the light.

15:48.737 --> 15:51.980
From what I hear, he needs
course correcting, but leave me out.

15:53.075 --> 15:55.419
Write me off. Or don't.

Either way, blow.

Stop, Blue. Sonics don't work.

16:09.458 --> 16:13.338

SCARAB: Frequency adjusted. Proceed.

[SCREAMS]

16:16.165 --> 16:19.738
Blue, break off. Whatever you're doing,
break off before it kills you.

16:19.902 --> 16:22.246
No, it's not attacking.

16:22.404 --> 16:23.747
It's communicating.

16:24.039 --> 16:26.019
Communicating its pain.

<i>Listen.</i>

16:27.977 --> 16:33.359
[IN GOLEM'S VOICE] Where is the stillness
of wood, of stone, of crystal, of metal?

16:33.515 --> 16:37.827
All this noise, all this life, is pain.

16:37.987 --> 16:40.593
We sensed the power in this place.

16:40.756 --> 16:46.263
Power enough to destroy us,
to end the pain, to be still again.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.166
I can relate.

16:48.330 --> 16:52.039
I mean, we can help you.
We will help you.

Sorry, meat, but we can't have that.

[BLUE BEETLE MOANS]

Don't know who you guys are,
but you took that thing down.

17:35.611 --> 17:37.318
Probably saved the whole East Coast.

17:41.483 --> 17:43.156
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
It was alive...

17:43.419 --> 17:45.763
and now it's gone.

17:47.156 --> 17:49.693
Who attacked? Who killed it?

17:50.192 --> 17:52.638
Someone ugly.

17:56.231 --> 17:58.677
I'm telling you, they're long...

18:01.136 --> 18:02.513
Gone.

18:03.839 --> 18:05.039
[WHIRRING]

18:07.376 --> 18:08.855
They're alive, breathing.

18:09.011 --> 18:12.652
Steady heartbeats, but non-responsive.

18:16.018 --> 18:19.625
As requested, Ugly and Whisper
are now a living warning...

18:19.788 --> 18:22.166
to anyone straying
from the path of the Light.

18:22.324 --> 18:24.235
But why blow up Gruesome?

18:24.393 --> 18:26.202
Seems like a wasted resource.

18:26.362 --> 18:31.675
MAN: A resource falling into enemy hands
is a resource best disposed of.

18:31.834 --> 18:36.010

How'd it go'?

18:53.389 --> 18:54.766
It didn't.

18:54.923 --> 18:56.266
We talked.

18:56.425 --> 18:58.496
He wouldn't hear us.

18:58.927 --> 19:03.672
And on top of that, my Vietnamese
Lit paper's still due at 8 a.m.

19:03.832 --> 19:07.439
- I don't suppose I could copy off yours?
- Heh.

19:08.904 --> 19:10.104
Not a chance.

19:10.139 --> 19:12.141
Hey, it's after midnight.

19:12.307 --> 19:13.877
Happy Valentine's Day, Artemis.

19:14.043 --> 19:15.386
You remembered.

19:15.544 --> 19:17.455
Come on,
what kind of jerk would I be...

19:17.613 --> 19:19.752
if I forgot Valentine's Day?

19:19.915 --> 19:21.451
For the fifth year in a row.

19:21.817 --> 19:23.728
Well, I remembered too.

19:23.886 --> 19:27.231
I got you your favorite food, everything.

19:27.389 --> 19:29.960
Babe, you rock.

19:32.161 --> 19:34.038
You're still worried about Roy.

19:34.463 --> 19:36.033
He's lost, babe.

19:36.532 --> 19:38.034
Alone.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.612
The guy just won't let anyone in.

Cheshire.

20:05.194 --> 20:06.571
Chill, Red.

20:06.728 --> 20:08.264
I'm not here to fight.

20:08.430 --> 20:10.842
I'm here to make you clean up your act.

20:12.134 --> 20:13.408
Not you too.

20:13.569 --> 20:16.311
Forget it, Jade,
you lost the right to backseat drive...

20:16.472 --> 20:18.952
when you left me
to return to a life of crime.

20:19.241 --> 20:20.811
That's not why I left.

20:20.976 --> 20:23.149
It was just a side benefit.

20:23.312 --> 20:27.419
Besides, I'm still your wife, legally.

20:27.583 --> 20:31.121
Grants me certain privileges
to knock sense into you.

20:31.286 --> 20:35.257
Roy, I left because your obsession
with finding Speedy was all-consuming.

20:35.424 --> 20:38.633
There wasn't room in your life
for anything else or anyone.

20:38.794 --> 20:41.866
Not me, and not our daughter.

20:42.030 --> 20:44.533
We have a daughter?

20:44.967 --> 20:46.571
Lian Nguyen-Harper.

20:46.735 --> 20:48.737
She needs her father, Roy.

20:48.904 --> 20:52.215
You have to get your head on straight,
for her.

20:52.641 --> 20:57.715
And that means you need to exorcise
Speedy's ghost once and for all.

20:58.147 --> 21:03.654
So while I was away,
I called in every chip I had.

21:04.019 --> 21:05.657
I got us a lead, Red.
