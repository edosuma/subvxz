24:47.319 --> 24:49.738
<i>I feel like that's how most women operate.</i>

24:49.821 --> 24:52.491
<i>We like, "I know there are</i>

24:52.574 --> 24:56.244
<i>Right? That's how we think</i>
<i>so we can go about our life. You know?</i>

24:56.745 --> 25:00.624
<i>"I heard my sister married one. She…"</i>

25:00.707 --> 25:02.959
<i>"Her brother, he was a good man."</i>

<i>but these drivers, they pull up</i>
<i>to the house, it's 3:00 a.m.</i>

25:24.814 --> 25:26.983
<i>They say shit like, "You live here alone?"</i>

25:27.067 --> 25:30.820
<i>Like, why would you say that?</i>
<i>Why don't you know that's creepy?</i>

25:30.904 --> 25:34.115
<i>That's happened to me multiple times.</i>
<i>"You live here alone?" Like…</i>

25:34.199 --> 25:37.035
<i>Twenty minutes of silence,</i>
<i>this is what you choose to say</i>

25:37.577 --> 25:39.079
<i>and when you choose to say it?</i>

25:39.162 --> 25:41.998
<i>What is happening right now?</i>
<i>They turn you into a liar.</i>

25:42.082 --> 25:44.751
<i>You gotta be like,</i>
<i>"No. It's just me and my two husbands."</i>

25:46.336 --> 25:48.296
<i>"And our pit bulls." You know?</i>

25:48.380 --> 25:50.966
<i>"We run a pit bull academy</i>
<i>if you want to come by."</i>

25:51.049 --> 25:54.010
<i>[laughs]</i>

25:57.472 --> 25:59.015
<i>It sucks 'cause I love Ubers.</i>

25:59.099 --> 26:02.185
<i>That's how I pretend that I'm rich.</i>
<i>I get in and I'm like, "Drive."</i>

26:03.353 --> 26:05.772
<i>That's my shit,</i>
<i>and they fuck it up for me.</i>

26:05.855 --> 26:09.359
<i>I wanna take naps and shit in the Uber,</i>
<i>but you can't nap in the Ubers.</i>

26:09.442 --> 26:12.153
<i>Right? Not with a male driver.</i>
<i>Ladies, we know that.</i>

26:12.237 --> 26:15.240
<i>Can't sleep. Can't even catch a wink.</i>

26:15.323 --> 26:17.075
<i>Once in a while I get a female driver.</i>

26:17.158 --> 26:19.327
<i>That little thing pops up.</i>
<i>I see the woman face.</i>

26:19.411 --> 26:23.081
<i>I'm like, "Ah!" Just light a joint.</i>
<i>"I'm about to relax." I love it.</i>

26:23.164 --> 26:24.249
<i>[grunts happily]</i>

26:25.125 --> 26:27.419

<i>You gotta… You know?</i>

26:32.591 --> 26:34.801
<i>Gotta let 'em see the whites. You know?</i>

26:37.178 --> 26:39.681
<i>You gotta not only be awake,</i>
<i>but make sure they know it.</i>

26:39.764 --> 26:42.142
<i>So that's posture and…</i>
<i>[exclaims] You know?</i>

26:43.560 --> 26:46.896

27:17.677 --> 27:19.721
<i>[laughs] Gotta stay alive.</i>

27:21.848 --> 27:25.560

27:25.644 --> 27:28.730
<i>It only happened once.</i>
<i>That's why I remember it so clearly.</i>

27:28.813 --> 27:30.732

<i>You ever hear the </i>Law &amp; Order<i>…</i>
<i>[mimics sound effect] …in your head?</i>

27:38.365 --> 27:40.742
<i>I thought it was on the radio,</i>
<i>it was so clear.</i>

27:40.825 --> 27:44.037
<i>It was just my brain, my alert,</i>
<i>like, "What the fuck you doing?"</i>

27:44.120 --> 27:44.954
<i>You know?</i>

27:45.914 --> 27:49.125
<i>And sure enough, that weirdo</i>
<i>was staring at me dead in my eyeballs,</i>

27:49.209 --> 27:51.169
<i>and he didn't look away.</i>
<i>That's a murderer.</i>

27:52.087 --> 27:53.672
<i>Right? That's a murderer.</i>

27:53.755 --> 27:56.883
<i>Sane people know,</i>
<i>if you get caught staring,</i>

27:57.592 --> 27:59.761
<i>"Hey. Sorry." You know?</i>
<i>They're embarrassed.</i>

27:59.844 --> 28:03.098
<i>No. He was… You know?</i>
<i>I live in New York, so I'm like, "Hey!"</i>

28:03.181 --> 28:05.975
<i>You know what I mean?</i>
<i>But he didn't look away.</i>

28:06.059 --> 28:09.479
<i>That was ten minutes</i>
<i>of extended eye contact on that ride.</i>

28:09.562 --> 28:11.898
<i>I'm farting for my life in the back.</i>
<i>It was crazy.</i>

28:13.483 --> 28:15.235
