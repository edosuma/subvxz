00:09.108 --> 00:12.644

[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ mister, we could use a man ¶

[ Archie, Edith ]
¶ gee, our old lasalle
ran great ¶

00:40.205 --> 00:44.643
¶ those were the days ¶

00:52.785 --> 00:54.719
hey, arch,
look at this weather
you're gonna have.

00:54.787 --> 00:58.289
Orlando, Florida--
high of 84 degrees.
Ah, beautiful.

00:58.357 --> 01:00.692
Hey, maybe you and ma
ought to take bathing suits.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.261
Nah, we ain't going
down to Florida to swim.

01:03.328 --> 01:06.264
We're going to go down
there to see Disney world.

01:06.331 --> 01:08.767
And, boy, that's
gonna be something to see.

01:08.834 --> 01:13.071
I'm reading here it cost them
over 400 million bucks to build.

01:13.139 --> 01:17.175
You realize what that
comes to in dollars and cents?

01:17.242 --> 01:19.878
Hey, I bet ma was excited
when you told her about it.

01:19.945 --> 01:22.147
Oh, hey.
Excited ain't the word.

01:22.214 --> 01:25.349
Boy, I-- but you know,
a funny thing happened.

01:25.417 --> 01:27.852
I come in and I said,
"Edith, the lodge
is springin'...

01:27.920 --> 01:31.122
For a special
charter flight down there
for the weekend, you know."

01:31.190 --> 01:33.825
So she starts jumpin' up
and down laughing. And then...

01:33.893 --> 01:37.662
I think it was about
the third jump,
she come down crying.

01:37.730 --> 01:42.033
- That's strange.
- That's screwy,
even for your mother.

01:42.101 --> 01:45.303
Edith, come out of the kitchen.
I wanna show you something
in the magazine here.

01:45.370 --> 01:47.172
She's not here, daddy.
She ran down to the market.

01:47.239 --> 01:50.909
Aw, gee.
I hope she don't get hung up
in them sales down there.

01:50.976 --> 01:54.145
She's a sucker for specials.
That's why we got 15 pounds
of nuts in the closet.

01:54.213 --> 01:56.247
We ain't even got a monkey.

01:57.683 --> 01:59.851
I eat those nuts.

02:04.223 --> 02:08.359
Well, you ain't long
out of the trees anyway.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.830
<i>Hey, Edith.</i>
<i>There you are.</i>

02:11.897 --> 02:14.933
- Gee, we're waiting here.
We're starving.
- Don't rush me, Archie bunker.

02:15.000 --> 02:19.604
You'll get your dinner on time.
You always get dinner on time.

02:19.671 --> 02:22.673
And don't you
forget that neither.

02:22.742 --> 02:25.877
Ma, let me help you
with those bags.
Leave me alone.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.147
What's the matter with ma?

02:29.215 --> 02:31.716
I was gonna ask you.

02:31.784 --> 02:35.386
Get out of the way, Gloria.
<i>Hey, Edith, there.</i>

02:35.454 --> 02:37.622
Is, uh, something
the matter with you?
No.

02:37.689 --> 02:40.391
Well, I just wanna
know if you're all right.
Don't argue with me.

02:40.459 --> 02:44.729
Edith, I ain't arguin'. I just--
if you're asking for a fight,
you're gonna get one.

02:46.498 --> 02:51.102
Is something wrong?
Oh, leave me alone, damn it!

02:57.476 --> 02:59.644
Did she really say that?

02:59.711 --> 03:03.214
If I didn't hear that
with my own ears,
I wouldn't believe it.

03:03.282 --> 03:07.652
[ Clattering ]
Listen to that.

03:07.719 --> 03:10.155
She never wallops
the pots that way.

03:10.222 --> 03:13.424
Gee, I don't know what
to expect from her next.

03:13.492 --> 03:17.395
You know, last night
I'm sleeping there in bed there
peaceful like a baby,

03:17.462 --> 03:22.066
and suddenly I get the feeling
that somebody's watching me.

03:22.134 --> 03:26.604
So I open up my eyes
and there she is sitting
there staring at me.

03:26.672 --> 03:29.540
I says, "Edith,
why are you watching me?"

03:29.608 --> 03:33.077
She says,
"what else is there to watch?
Johnny Carson's off."

03:34.479 --> 03:36.915
I wonder what's
got her so upset.

03:36.982 --> 03:40.285
Oh, my.
It's so nice to be home.

03:42.188 --> 03:44.789
Hey, Edith,
you ain't mad at nothing?

03:44.857 --> 03:49.660
Mad? What would I be mad about?
Here's your beer.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.963
Ma, you sure
you're all right?

03:52.031 --> 03:54.833
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

03:54.900 --> 03:56.901
Well, I just, uh, you know,
I want you to be all set...

03:56.969 --> 03:59.570
For the three-day excursion
down to Florida, that's all.

03:59.638 --> 04:03.274
Oh, I'm all set.
I'm looking forward to it.

04:03.342 --> 04:05.676
Yeah, that's swell. Swell.
Look, sit down in your chair...

04:05.744 --> 04:09.180
'Cause I wanna show you
something in the magazine
I found there.

04:11.016 --> 04:16.553
Uh, there's a whole
article in here, Edith,
on Disney world here.

04:16.620 --> 04:19.589
Oh, look at this.
Here's the first page, see?

04:19.658 --> 04:22.493
Mickey mouse leading
the grand parade, huh?

04:22.561 --> 04:24.495
Ain't that cute?
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah.

04:24.563 --> 04:27.732
You know, it never
occurred to me before.
Mickey mouse is black.

04:27.799 --> 04:31.336
Aw, get out of here
with that stuff, huh?

04:34.106 --> 04:38.743
Mickey mouse ain't got no race.
He stands for all men.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.778
That's why Walt
made him a mouse.

04:42.514 --> 04:45.216
Listen, don't be
puttin' down Walt Disney.
I'm gonna tell you something.

04:45.284 --> 04:48.086
There's a guy named
Billy hartfeld that works
with me down at the plant.

04:48.153 --> 04:50.088
This is a guy that's
been all over the world.

04:50.155 --> 04:54.292
He's traveled everywhere,
seen and done everything.
He's got tattoos to prove it.

04:54.360 --> 04:59.430
And when a guy like Billy
hartfeld tells me he wants
to go to Disney world to die--

04:59.498 --> 05:01.665
on this trip?

05:04.503 --> 05:07.939
No, Edith.
Not on this trip.
Oh, good.

05:09.141 --> 05:11.675
He's gonna give me
a couple of them, you know,

05:11.743 --> 05:14.779
bright, flowery shirts he's got
to wear outside the pants...

05:14.846 --> 05:17.515
So I won't look
like a tourist down there.

05:18.517 --> 05:21.886
Oh, my, it's hot in here.

05:21.954 --> 05:23.888
Open the window, will you, Mike?

05:24.890 --> 05:27.292
- It is open, ma.
- It is?

05:27.359 --> 05:31.595
Why am I throwing away
money on heat when you got
the windows open? Close it.

05:31.663 --> 05:34.465
I want it open!

05:34.533 --> 05:36.467
Edith, I want it closed.

05:36.535 --> 05:39.103
It's my home too.

05:39.171 --> 05:43.007
All right.
We both own the house.
We both own the furniture.

05:43.075 --> 05:45.109
We both own the window,
half and half.

05:45.177 --> 05:49.680
I want my half closed.
Now stifle yourself, will you.

05:49.748 --> 05:53.017
Oh, that's
a terrible thing to say.

05:53.085 --> 05:55.086
What is, "stifle"?

05:55.154 --> 05:57.588
Yeah, how can you
say that to me?

05:57.656 --> 06:01.125
I've been saying that
to you for years, Edith.
Now, will you stifle.

06:01.193 --> 06:05.997
There, you said it again.
[ Sobbing ]

06:07.333 --> 06:09.934
What the hell
do you call this?

06:10.002 --> 06:12.603
Daddy, I think you
hurt her feelings.

06:12.671 --> 06:16.674
After 23 years of stifles,
the dingbat turns on me.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.078
Daddy, I think
you better do something.

06:20.145 --> 06:22.947
Yeah, I think so too.
And I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.716
I'm gonna step outside
and get myself
a breath of fresh air.

06:25.784 --> 06:29.653
And when your mother gets
back to normal out there, just
holler for me down the street.

06:29.721 --> 06:33.458
Well, then why don't you
stop by the mcnabs and pick up
the suitcases you're borrowing.

06:33.525 --> 06:35.860
- Good idea.
- Michael, you go with him.

06:35.927 --> 06:39.097
Why?
'Cause I gotta
have a talk with ma, okay?

06:39.164 --> 06:41.065
All right.
Wait up, arch.

06:41.133 --> 06:44.602
¶ I'm in the mood for love ¶

06:44.669 --> 06:50.108
¶ simply because
you're near me ¶

06:50.175 --> 06:52.410
¶ funny but when ¶

06:52.478 --> 06:54.412
where are you two going?

06:54.480 --> 06:58.816
I'm gonna step over to mcnab's
and pick up the suitcases
we're gonna borrow there.

06:58.884 --> 07:03.954
No, don't worry about dinner.
Just keep it warm there
for a few minutes, huh?

07:04.023 --> 07:06.590
Geez.

07:06.658 --> 07:11.595
Your father is
acting so strange lately.

07:11.663 --> 07:13.597
No, ma.
It isn't daddy.

07:13.665 --> 07:16.467
Come on over here for a minute.
I wanna have a talk with you.

07:16.535 --> 07:18.736
I wanna show you
a magazine I've been reading.

07:18.803 --> 07:22.240
And there's an article in it
that I think applies to you.

07:22.307 --> 07:24.242
Here it is, ma.

07:24.309 --> 07:29.047
Look here. It explains
why you've been having those
hot and cold spells lately.

07:29.114 --> 07:31.916
It does?
Yeah, look at the article.

07:31.983 --> 07:35.420
Ma, have you been more
forgetful than usual?

07:35.487 --> 07:39.457
Forgetful?
I don't know.
Let me think.

07:43.362 --> 07:47.898
Ma.
Gloria,
what did you just ask me?

07:47.966 --> 07:51.235
Ma, I think I know
what's the matter.
It's the change.

07:51.303 --> 07:53.871
You mean spring is coming?

07:56.641 --> 08:00.078
No, ma. Not the seasons.
I'm talking about life.

08:00.145 --> 08:02.080
Don't you see?
The forgetfulness,
the hot flashes.

08:02.147 --> 08:04.082
It's the change of life.

08:05.717 --> 08:08.286
Oh, my.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.090
At my age?

08:14.359 --> 08:18.463
Oh, no.
I ain't supposed
to change yet, am I?

08:18.530 --> 08:23.000
Ma, it says in the article
it can start anytime after 40.

08:23.068 --> 08:26.704
And when it does, it can
turn you into an old woman.

08:26.771 --> 08:30.108
Oh, no, ma.
That doesn't happen nowadays.

08:30.175 --> 08:32.876
It's a natural,
beautiful time of life.

08:32.943 --> 08:37.047
Beautiful? Well,
it don't feel very beautiful.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.384
I feel like I'm jumpin'
in and out of a hot bath...

08:40.452 --> 08:44.288
And somebody's twisting
a rubber band around my head.

08:44.356 --> 08:48.559
Oh, ma, there's
nothing to worry about.
Look, it says right here.

08:48.627 --> 08:53.364
"Nowadays, with simple
hormone treatment, there are
no unpleasant manifestations."

08:54.533 --> 08:56.467
Well, my aunt Elizabeth
went through this...

08:56.535 --> 08:58.469
And she didn't get
manifestations,

08:58.537 --> 09:01.372
she got a mustache.

09:06.145 --> 09:11.182
Ma, here. You better
read this article.

09:11.250 --> 09:15.786
It's written by a very
important doctor, and
he knows everything about it.

09:17.256 --> 09:20.124
He don't know your father.

09:20.192 --> 09:24.228
When Archie hears about this,
he ain't gonna love me no more.

09:24.296 --> 09:26.230
Oh, ma, of course he will.

09:26.298 --> 09:28.332
Oh, I'm sorry. Imagine,

09:28.400 --> 09:32.570
you having to tell me
what's wrong.

09:32.638 --> 09:36.807
When I was a young girl,
I didn't know what every
young girl should know.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.976
Now I'm gonna be
an old lady,

09:39.044 --> 09:42.280
and I don't know what every
old lady should know.

09:46.251 --> 09:49.487
Oh, ma, you're not old.
Open the door,
big meathead.

09:49.555 --> 09:53.123
It's your father.
Don't you say a word
to him about this.

09:53.192 --> 09:57.061
I ain't gonna let him
see me getting upset.

09:57.128 --> 10:00.030
Take it easy.
Hello, Archie.

10:00.098 --> 10:04.268
Oh, hi, Edith. Yeah, I'm back
with the bags. I just got these
from mcnab. Ain't they beauties?

10:04.336 --> 10:06.571
But they're black!

10:06.638 --> 10:10.007
Black is for funerals,
not for vacations!

10:10.075 --> 10:13.877
I can't lay out cash
for new suitcases.

10:13.945 --> 10:17.047
We gotta save all our money
for Disney world, huh?

10:17.115 --> 10:19.917
Edith, Edith, look.
Mcnab got this other brochure.

10:19.984 --> 10:23.321
Another Disney
brochure I wanna show you.
Sit down in the chair, huh?

10:23.388 --> 10:26.257
This has got pictures
of the most beautiful
things in here.

10:26.325 --> 10:30.060
Wait till I show you this.
One of them in here,
an all-bear band.

10:30.128 --> 10:34.131
A naked band at Disney world?
No, no, no.

10:34.199 --> 10:37.101
Edith. You know, bears.
Like brown bears,
grizzly bears, them.

10:37.168 --> 10:40.037
Oh, I hate bears.
Yeah, but they ain't
real bears, Edith. Look.

10:40.105 --> 10:42.707
I hate all bears.
Take it away.

10:42.774 --> 10:45.042
I'm just trying
to show you something here.
Stifle!

10:47.000 --> 10:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:54.819 --> 10:58.188
- What did you say to me?
- I said, "stifle."

10:59.258 --> 11:01.859
Pinch me, will you?

11:01.926 --> 11:05.396
I told you to stifle!
[ Sobs ]

11:05.464 --> 11:07.498
Ma, are you all right?
Leave me alone.

11:07.566 --> 11:11.902
Nobody's doing nothing to you.
You listen to me.
Ma.

11:11.970 --> 11:14.772
All of you, listen to me.

11:14.839 --> 11:16.907
Well, stop looking at me.

11:19.177 --> 11:21.746
I said stifle
and I mean stifle.

11:21.813 --> 11:24.214
Stifle, stifle, stifle!

11:25.651 --> 11:29.853
We're not going to Disney world,
or any other world!

11:30.922 --> 11:34.692
We're not going anyplace!
[ Sobbing ]

11:42.601 --> 11:45.403
Yeah, thanks. Hey, uh, miss.
Cream for the coffee, eh?

11:45.470 --> 11:48.105
Look, I only got two hands.

11:53.278 --> 11:56.380
You'd think I ordered
a four-course dinner
from her, the dope.

11:57.582 --> 12:00.384
Gee, daddy. You're really
on edge, aren't you?

12:00.452 --> 12:02.820
Well, why wouldn't I be?
Why'd you have to
drag me down here...

12:02.887 --> 12:06.924
To this fancy
doctor of your mother,
the "groinecologist" guy?

12:12.698 --> 12:16.066
Gynecologist, daddy.
Oh, all right.
Whatever.

12:16.134 --> 12:19.269
I had to sit up there
in that waiting room
with all them women...

12:19.338 --> 12:21.605
Gawking at me,
gawking at you.

12:21.673 --> 12:25.175
Who knows what
they were thinking.
Holy cow.

12:26.177 --> 12:28.512
I know you didn't
wanna go, daddy.

12:28.580 --> 12:32.049
But it's important
that you understand about
this time of ma's life.

12:32.116 --> 12:36.119
I ain't understood no time
of your mother's life.

12:36.187 --> 12:39.022
Hey, miss,
cream for the coffee here.
It's coming.

12:40.291 --> 12:44.362
I ain't seen a good waitress
since the depression.

12:44.429 --> 12:48.532
You know something? I haven't
been out for an ice cream
with you since I was a kid.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.135
Remember when you used
to take me out all the time?
Certainly, I do.

12:52.203 --> 12:56.273
Remember the game
you used to play where you'd
steal the cherry off the top?

12:57.476 --> 12:59.610
You was wise to me
stealing all them cherries?

12:59.678 --> 13:02.012
Oh, sure, I was.
You know what I used to do?

13:02.080 --> 13:04.014
I used to give them
a couple of quick licks first...

13:04.082 --> 13:06.417
And then put them back
on before I let you steal them.

13:06.485 --> 13:08.419
[ Laughing ]

13:13.825 --> 13:15.793
You done that, huh?

13:17.863 --> 13:20.865
Hey, daddy.
Ma's all right, isn't she?

13:20.932 --> 13:24.602
The doctor didn't say there
was anything wrong except that
she's going through menopause?

13:24.669 --> 13:29.373
Shush.
Here's your cream.

13:29.441 --> 13:34.612
Yeah, well,
the coffee's cold now.
It was hot when I brought it.

13:34.679 --> 13:38.248
"Hot when I brought it."

13:38.316 --> 13:44.121
Why do you have to talk
so loud there about your
mother's interior problems?

13:44.188 --> 13:47.090
Sorry.
Can't you keep your voice down?

13:47.158 --> 13:51.061
You're just gonna have to be
patient and extra nice to her
for the next couple of weeks.

13:51.129 --> 13:52.963
Ain't I always?

13:54.866 --> 13:56.801
Thank you.

14:04.609 --> 14:09.212
Would you believe
that there ain't
nothing in there?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.917
This dame is
as off the rails
as your mother.

14:16.688 --> 14:19.089
No, I can't talk about it
with you, Mike.

14:19.157 --> 14:21.725
It's hard enough
talking about it to Gloria.

14:21.793 --> 14:23.928
But, ma, Gloria explained
the whole thing to me.

14:23.995 --> 14:26.263
[ Gasps ]
She did?

14:26.331 --> 14:28.365
Sure. About the hot flashes
and the forgetfulness.

14:28.433 --> 14:31.401
Ma, you don't have to
be embarrassed by it.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.403
I mean, it's a completely
natural thing.

14:33.472 --> 14:36.406
You should be excited.
Excited?

14:36.475 --> 14:38.843
Sure. You're starting
the best years of your life.

14:38.910 --> 14:42.546
I feel like I'm starting
out to the old folks' home.

14:42.614 --> 14:46.283
And that's probably
what that doctor is
telling Archie right now.

14:46.351 --> 14:48.486
Oh, ma, come on.
Don't be silly.

14:48.553 --> 14:51.789
This can be a beginning for you.
You and Archie, you're secure.

14:51.857 --> 14:55.025
You've got your health.
And you've got each other.

14:55.093 --> 14:57.561
I hope we still got each other.

14:57.629 --> 15:01.231
Oh, ma.
Hey, sure you do.

15:01.299 --> 15:03.534
Hey, you got Gloria and me.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.403
And someday
you'll have grandchildren
to look forward to.

15:07.438 --> 15:09.607
Oh, Mike, that's nice.

15:09.674 --> 15:13.310
Grandchildren.
Sure.

15:13.378 --> 15:16.413
But that would
make me a grandmother.

15:20.952 --> 15:24.121
Oh, hiya there, meathead.
Hi, Michael.

15:24.188 --> 15:26.657
- Where's your mother-in-law?
- Oh, she's upstairs.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.726
I better go see how she is.

15:30.094 --> 15:33.998
I hope she's laying down
up there. I need the rest.

15:35.734 --> 15:37.668
What did the doctor say?

15:37.736 --> 15:42.640
He just said that
the menopause is a tough
time to be going through...

15:42.707 --> 15:45.442
Especially for nervous types.
So?

15:45.510 --> 15:48.612
So he prescribed
these here pills.
Oh, good.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.181
I gotta take
three of them a day.

15:58.657 --> 16:01.592
What about ma?
Ah, she'll be all right.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.695
Some other pills
here for her too.

16:04.763 --> 16:07.765
These are these hormones,
which by the way,

16:07.832 --> 16:10.935
hormones are pretty
hot stuff, you know.

16:11.002 --> 16:16.674
They do a kind of--
what you call-- realignment
job there on the glands.

16:16.741 --> 16:21.244
Of course your mother-in-law's
glands, they don't know
which way they're going.

16:21.312 --> 16:24.181
And neither does she.

16:24.248 --> 16:27.985
- But she's all right?
- <i>She's all right. But for</i>
<i> the next couple of weeks...</i>

16:28.053 --> 16:32.355
You can't expect to see
the regular dingbat
flying around here.

16:32.423 --> 16:37.494
Till these here pills
take effect, you're gonna
be looking at super-dingbat.

16:39.030 --> 16:42.600
What else did the doctor say?
Aw, he said
enough and too much.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.535
Telling me I gotta be
patient with her. Gotta be
kind to her all the time.

16:45.604 --> 16:49.339
Agree with her with everything.
Nice all the time. Geez.

16:49.407 --> 16:51.408
This change of life
is a lousy thing, you know.

16:51.476 --> 16:53.744
A man ain't got
no say in it at all.

16:53.812 --> 16:58.916
<i>I hope we didn't</i>
<i>overdo it, Gloria.</i>
<i>No, ma, not at all.</i>

16:58.984 --> 17:02.486
Hey, ma, you look terrific.
He noticed.

17:02.553 --> 17:05.188
Hey, daddy.
Come on out here.
What did you do?

17:05.256 --> 17:09.259
Gloria put some
false eyelashes on me.

17:09.327 --> 17:13.063
Hey, they look nice.
I hope Archie likes them.

17:13.131 --> 17:17.166
<i>Archie.</i>
<i>Oh, hiya there, Edith.</i>
<i>You feel any better?</i>

17:17.234 --> 17:20.270
You notice something
different about me, Archie?

17:20.338 --> 17:22.339
Uh, what did you have in mind?

17:23.508 --> 17:26.376
Look at my eyes.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.879
Oh, yeah. The eyes. Yeah.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.682
Uh, they look terrific, Edith.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.584
You don't like them.
Wait a minute.
I didn't say that.

17:34.653 --> 17:38.122
I do like them
on you there, Edith.
They make you look younger.

17:38.189 --> 17:40.891
Oh.
Archie, what are you doing?

17:40.959 --> 17:43.861
Let me alone. I'm following
the doctor's orders here.

17:43.928 --> 17:47.597
Edith,
when I was down there at
the drugstore getting the pills,

17:47.666 --> 17:49.599
I picked up a little
present for you here.

17:49.668 --> 17:53.737
A present for me?
Oh, Archie.

17:53.805 --> 17:56.206
Oh. Well, all right.
All right, Edith.

17:58.076 --> 18:00.978
It ain't exactly
the pope diamond, you know.

18:04.482 --> 18:07.885
Go ahead.
Open it up yourself.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.421
What's it for?

18:11.489 --> 18:14.391
Well, that's for your
condition, Edith, you know.
When you get the hot flushes.

18:14.458 --> 18:16.493
Let me show you.

See, there's a little
switch here. And you just
turn it on like that.

18:19.698 --> 18:21.732
No, don't be scared of it.
Don't be scared of it.

18:21.800 --> 18:26.804
No, that's your own
individualistic, private--
what do you call-- cooler, see?

18:26.871 --> 18:28.972
Go ahead.
Shine it on yourself.

18:31.275 --> 18:33.210
<i>Ain't that nice?</i>

Oh, I better fill out
the guarantee card.

Oh, no, no, no.
Let me do that for you,
Edith, sweetheart.

18:45.356 --> 18:48.158
But I like to fill them out.

the sports section
of this paper, huh?

to line the garbage pail.

pot roast of yours.

Well, we're not
gonna have pot roast.

too early and it burned up.

That's okay.

gave me these pills.

He don't mind
the pot roast burning up.

He don't mind the sports
section in the garbage pail.

on the table.

about where we're going.

cute teenagers.

The only way you're gonna
get me to go to Scranton...

23:27.205 --> 23:30.440
Is if some screwball
hijacks the airplane.

23:32.743 --> 23:35.078
I know all about your
woman's troubles there, Edith.

23:35.146 --> 23:39.649

that time, I didn't
make you wear the truss.

- Daddy.
- No, no, no.

have a change of life,
you gotta do it right now.

just 30 seconds.
Now, come on, change.

24:06.044 --> 24:08.445
The soup is lousy.
Forget it.

and call the lodge...

is going down to Florida
as "pre-deranged."

Right away, Archie.

fancy doctor telling me
to be agreeing with her,

to be kind, to be patient,
to be a jerk!

that phone number?
