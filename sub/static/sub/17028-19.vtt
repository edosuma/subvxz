More lemonade, sir?

00:03.328 --> 00:04.984
Full disclosure,
it's a pitcher of water

00:05.039 --> 00:07.195
we can't get the 
lemon taste out of.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.273
Sir?

00:13.609 --> 00:15.779
Max, either this guy's
pretending to be dead

00:15.827 --> 00:17.061
to get out of paying the check

00:17.109 --> 00:19.531
or Oleg's chili has killed again.

00:20.078 --> 00:21.507
This is my Earl mirror.

00:21.578 --> 00:23.765
I use it during naps to make
sure he's still breathing.

00:23.859 --> 00:26.664
And 80% of the time he is.

00:32.928 --> 00:35.647
Han, there's a dead
body at table three,

00:36.201 --> 00:39.030
the saddest place to die
other than table two.

00:39.405 --> 00:40.842
Oleg, get out here!

00:40.975 --> 00:43.624
Someone's deader 
than Max's emotions.

00:45.116 --> 00:47.881
I really should throw 
away that chili.

00:48.514 --> 00:51.624
Let's prop him up outside
with a Salvation Army bucket.

00:51.763 --> 00:54.365
Whatever he collects,
we split in the morning.

00:54.585 --> 00:56.585
Uh, count me out.

00:56.733 --> 00:59.194
If they catch the five
of us with a dead body,

00:59.303 --> 01:01.905
you know they're gonna
blame the black guy.

01:02.835 --> 01:05.850
Okay, everyone grab 
a limb and lift.

Bobby's in the shower!

01:32.642 --> 01:35.962
That's how much he likes me,
he's using our shower.

01:36.845 --> 01:39.674
He makes me so happy.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.306
Yeah, I heard.

01:43.314 --> 01:45.133
It sounded like someone
was trying to connect

01:45.181 --> 01:47.610
with a dial-up modem out here.

01:48.712 --> 01:49.919
Sorry.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.189
That's just what I sound like

01:51.237 --> 01:54.024
when I go online.

01:54.610 --> 01:56.712
But really, he makes me
feel like that all the time.

01:56.806 --> 01:59.353
He's perfect. We're perfect.

01:59.457 --> 02:02.212
Caroline, you shouldn't
get too carried away.

02:02.321 --> 02:03.689
Nothing is perfect.

02:03.798 --> 02:06.478
Except that game I
pitched for the Yankees.

02:07.134 --> 02:08.782
Actually, it is perfect.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.103
We're amazing together,

02:10.202 --> 02:12.728
and I really don't want to
hear from Negative Nancy.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.343
What the... who's Negative Nancy?

02:15.946 --> 02:19.439
Everyone knows I go by
"Negative Juggs McGee."

02:19.978 --> 02:22.212
I'm just saying you don't
know him that well yet.

02:22.599 --> 02:25.430
I know what this is about,
and it's not me and Bobby.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.898
You're worried I'm gonna get hurt

02:26.946 --> 02:28.845
because of what happened
between you and Randy.

02:28.939 --> 02:30.558
It's not about that.

02:30.658 --> 02:31.876
I just know guys,

02:31.924 --> 02:33.556
and you haven't been in a relationship

02:33.604 --> 02:35.853
since Ben was the best Affleck.

02:36.353 --> 02:37.626
Hey there.

02:37.713 --> 02:39.829
It's amazing,
I'm somehow less clean now

02:39.946 --> 02:41.649
than when I went in.

02:42.884 --> 02:43.979
I gotta get going, babe.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.377
I'll meet you at the dessert bar.

02:45.425 --> 02:47.290
We're having lunch with
his mom and his sister.

02:47.337 --> 02:49.010
I'm almost part of the family now.

02:49.071 --> 02:50.598
Well, if you were part of the family

02:50.646 --> 02:52.033
you'd be addicted to Diet Pepsi

02:52.081 --> 02:54.368
and get into mall
fights on Black Friday.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.618
Then I might be a cousin.

02:56.891 --> 02:58.509
Oh, you know what? I'll walk you out.

02:58.557 --> 02:59.929
If Homeless Larry tries to grab you,

02:59.977 --> 03:01.743
- I can fend him off.
- Yeah.

03:01.899 --> 03:04.767
Oh, careful, he's got
barbecue tongs now.

03:07.527 --> 03:09.605
Aww.

03:10.072 --> 03:11.441
Look at those two.

03:11.519 --> 03:16.121
That PDA is making me want
to M-A-S-T-U...

03:16.191 --> 03:18.324
Ah, I would stop you,

03:18.388 --> 03:21.191
but I doubt you know
what comes after U.

03:21.426 --> 03:23.990
Usually me.

03:27.285 --> 03:28.917
What do you guys want?

03:29.066 --> 03:32.308
Well, we're looking
for some entertainment.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.683
Oleg and I have
binge-watched everything.

03:35.926 --> 03:38.707
You know, we even watched
the <i>Santa Clarita Diet.</i>

03:38.840 --> 03:41.402
Now that's one diet
I'm not gonna stick to.

03:42.691 --> 03:46.434
Oh, Bobby must have
left his phone here.

03:46.435 --> 03:49.137
- Oh, crap.
- What's wrong?

03:49.138 --> 03:51.873
It's a text from Bobby's ex, Jessica.

03:51.874 --> 03:54.109
It says, "Call me about baby."

03:54.110 --> 03:57.112
Do Bobby and Jessica have a baby?

03:57.113 --> 03:59.047
Are they going to have one?

03:59.048 --> 04:02.450
And why does Bobby have
a rose gold iPhone?

04:02.451 --> 04:06.955
Maybe he got it with
his yearly mammogram.

04:06.956 --> 04:09.824
I knew this relationship
was too good to be true.

04:09.825 --> 04:12.327
Looks like I'm not Negative Nancy,

04:12.328 --> 04:15.764
more like Reality Check Rita.

04:15.765 --> 04:18.098
Then why the hell have I
been calling you Max?

04:18.916 --> 04:20.916
♪♪

04:20.964 --> 04:22.035
Oh, just a heads-up,

04:22.083 --> 04:23.558
Bobby's family is on its way over,

04:23.645 --> 04:26.379
so any X-rated
puppeteering you have to do,

04:26.457 --> 04:28.222
now is the time.

04:28.629 --> 04:31.910
Speaking of Bobby and people he knows,

04:32.043 --> 04:35.887
uh, does he still talk to
what's-her-name, Jessica?

04:36.019 --> 04:37.137
Pfft, no.

04:37.186 --> 04:39.277
She is long gone, like my bangs

04:39.387 --> 04:41.652
or democracy.

04:42.738 --> 04:44.259
Bobby never brings her up.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.043
We just talk about
our common interests,

04:46.105 --> 04:48.152
like how much we like my hair

04:48.285 --> 04:49.441
or how pretty I am.

04:49.519 --> 04:51.941
Yeah, but circling
back to other people,

04:52.035 --> 04:54.090
which is very hard with you,

04:54.762 --> 04:57.091
Jessica, do they talk? Text?

04:57.199 --> 04:59.027
Share custody?

04:59.738 --> 05:01.480
Max, why are you asking about her?

05:01.543 --> 05:03.965
Jessica is his ex-girlfriend.

05:04.035 --> 05:06.683
All Bobby's ever said about her
is that she's a wedding planner

05:06.731 --> 05:08.191
and she's out of his life.

05:08.316 --> 05:09.836
I know that's hard for you to believe,

05:09.894 --> 05:11.715
like the moon landing.

05:11.902 --> 05:13.308
Hey!

05:13.457 --> 05:14.715
You never see their faces.

05:14.809 --> 05:17.887
They brought back no cheese.
Just saying.

05:19.004 --> 05:21.074
- Now, please, just drop it.
- Fine-ah!

05:21.183 --> 05:22.996
Fine-ah.

05:24.394 --> 05:26.051
Oh, hi, Denise.

05:26.215 --> 05:27.488
Where's your mom and Bobby?

05:27.636 --> 05:29.304
Oh, we don't ride the subway together

05:29.355 --> 05:31.239
in case there's a crash.

05:31.496 --> 05:34.082
Somebody's gotta be
around for Black Friday.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.832
Well, now that Bobby's sister is here,

05:35.933 --> 05:37.965
I don't wanna mess up
your perfect brunch.

05:38.035 --> 05:40.081
I'm going to the diner,
where the only perfect thing

05:40.183 --> 05:42.887
is the owl-to-rat ratio.

05:43.449 --> 05:45.465
So you own this place?

05:45.558 --> 05:47.590
Man, I'd love to be my own boss.

05:47.643 --> 05:49.590
Mine treats me like garbage.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.504
If I want to get freaky with
the UPS guy on my break,

05:52.597 --> 05:54.574
that's my time.

05:55.316 --> 05:58.496
So what is it you do,
besides the UPS guy?

05:58.613 --> 06:01.433
I work the counter at the
Mail Boxes and Other Things.

06:01.551 --> 06:04.121
It's like Mail Boxes Etc,
but we have other things.

06:04.262 --> 06:05.308
Oh.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.488
I know it sounds cool,

06:06.552 --> 06:08.637
but my boss is always on me.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.417
Well, maybe you should
talk to your boss.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.795
You know, tell him how you feel,
stand up for yourself.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.415
I'm not great with confrontation,

06:14.519 --> 06:17.394
partially because I had
bad depth perception.

06:17.590 --> 06:21.379
Like, I have no idea how
far away you are right now.

06:24.574 --> 06:26.308
I'm right here.

06:27.177 --> 06:29.277
On second base.

06:31.512 --> 06:33.590
Well, I think you're great,

06:33.730 --> 06:36.691
and not inappropriate at all.

06:36.832 --> 06:39.996
And if your boss can't see that,
well, maybe you should quit.

06:41.696 --> 06:44.691
So the gentleman who looked
like Abraham Lincoln,

06:44.808 --> 06:48.066
was that a hipster or an Orthodox Jew?

06:48.621 --> 06:51.488
Either way, I don't understand
why you gave him a dollar.

06:54.131 --> 06:56.262
Mom, I quit!

06:58.566 --> 07:00.495
Wait, your mom is your boss?

07:00.730 --> 07:02.163
Is it the UPS man?

07:02.246 --> 07:05.019
He's your godfather. It's untoward.

07:05.597 --> 07:06.840
Where's this coming from?

07:06.949 --> 07:08.236
From my new best friend

07:08.284 --> 07:10.144
and women-in-business mentor,

07:10.418 --> 07:12.387
Caroline.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.402
You told my daughter
to quit working for me?

07:19.613 --> 07:21.738
I'm sure she meant
a different Caroline.

07:21.847 --> 07:23.158
I don't know.

07:23.238 --> 07:26.613
Everything got blurry
after she touched my boobs.

07:32.738 --> 07:34.357
♪♪

07:34.488 --> 07:37.168
Han, I'm about to say
what you said to me

07:37.262 --> 07:39.316
when you were trying to get
into an R-rated movie.

07:39.629 --> 07:41.312
I need your help.

07:41.488 --> 07:44.933
I told you three times,
I don't fit up drain pipes.

07:45.449 --> 07:47.574
Listen, I just saw this
text on Bobby's phone

07:47.622 --> 07:49.144
from his ex-girlfriend, Jessica.

07:49.192 --> 07:52.035
I think they might have
a secret baby together.

07:52.137 --> 07:55.387
Wow, that would really
devastate Caroline.

07:55.613 --> 07:59.379
More importantly, Bobby and
I are rose gold buddies.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.988
I just have to make sure
before I say anything

08:03.043 --> 08:04.073
to panic Caroline.

08:04.121 --> 08:05.470
I need to do some detective work,

08:05.518 --> 08:06.812
so you and I are gonna go down

08:06.860 --> 08:08.098
to Jessica's wedding planning business

08:08.145 --> 08:09.262
and pretend we're a couple.

08:09.310 --> 08:11.864
Obviously I'll be the groom.

08:12.066 --> 08:13.808
Max, this might come
as a surprise to you,

08:13.898 --> 08:15.730
but I'm a very busy man.

08:15.832 --> 08:18.230
I don't have time for your
sophomoric high jinks.

08:18.347 --> 08:20.590
Uh, that's what they
said to Adam Sandler,

08:20.639 --> 08:22.473
and it only made him richer.

08:22.785 --> 08:25.089
I'm flattered I was your first choice.

08:25.293 --> 08:27.996
Man, she asked me five people ago.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.168
I think she was down to you or a broom,

08:30.262 --> 08:32.691
and the broom was busy.

08:33.629 --> 08:37.051
If I'm doing this, we have to
use our best acting skills,

08:37.121 --> 08:40.457
'cause who's gonna
believe you landed me?

08:40.823 --> 08:44.980
Ugh, really wish Steve the Broom
didn't have Pilates at 4:00.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.301
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Ferraro.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.421
I had no idea you were the awful boss

08:51.516 --> 08:53.738
that was making her life miserable.

08:54.189 --> 08:55.355
Bobby, why didn't you tell me

08:55.403 --> 08:57.824
your mom owns a Mail
Boxes and Other Things?

08:57.956 --> 09:00.891
I didn't want you to date me
for the unlimited bubble wrap.

09:01.191 --> 09:02.857
Denise can't cope out in the world.

09:02.905 --> 09:04.427
You know how many times she's touched

09:04.474 --> 09:05.705
our neighbor's electric fence.

09:05.808 --> 09:07.585
To be fair, they installed it

09:07.633 --> 09:09.558
to keep her from falling in their pool.

09:10.113 --> 09:12.051
Well, you did this.
You take care of it.

09:12.099 --> 09:13.633
She's your responsibility now.

09:13.691 --> 09:16.082
Bobby, bring home some deserts for me.

09:16.334 --> 09:18.441
From Dunkin'!

09:18.964 --> 09:20.846
Bobby, I am so sorry.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.215
I don't want our first fight
to be over a misunderstanding.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.922
I want it to be about
something important,

09:24.969 --> 09:26.980
like if you want a soul patch.

09:27.777 --> 09:29.006
We're not fighting.

09:29.054 --> 09:30.262
This is a bump.

09:30.355 --> 09:31.918
I think you're overreacting.

09:32.121 --> 09:33.629
Then why are you yelling?

09:33.988 --> 09:35.488
I'm not yelling.

09:35.637 --> 09:37.965
Man, what's with all the yelling?

09:38.402 --> 09:42.340
Oh, Oleg, let's see where this goes.

09:42.699 --> 09:45.902
It's already better than
everything on Amazon.

09:46.394 --> 09:49.168
Just with it was a little
bit more <i>Game of Thrones-y.</i>

09:49.269 --> 09:51.375
And by that,
I mean a little more topless.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.785
And by that I mean, oh, oh, Bobby.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.512
Caroline, we're not fighting.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.941
But please, don't get in the middle

10:00.018 --> 10:01.394
of my ma and Denise again.

10:01.504 --> 10:02.618
My aunt tried once.

10:02.666 --> 10:05.254
Now she's really
scared of ceiling fans.

10:05.379 --> 10:08.225
I gotta go.
I still can't find my phone.

10:08.660 --> 10:11.277
Oleg, this is our new show.

10:11.426 --> 10:14.355
Grab the popcorn from my purse.

10:14.910 --> 10:17.902
You want cheddar cheese or kettle corn?

10:18.265 --> 10:20.351
You know I can hear you, right?

10:22.351 --> 10:24.406
Okay, this must be Jessica's office.

10:24.513 --> 10:26.968
Oh, here, better put
this on for the bit.

10:27.085 --> 10:28.703
This was smuggled out of North Korea

10:28.753 --> 10:32.320
by my great-grandfather
in his great backside.

10:32.584 --> 10:35.437
Oh, the classic tush cut.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.889
Now remember, we're detectives.

10:39.023 --> 10:42.656
We're like Cagney and the only
guy I could get to come with me.

10:43.632 --> 10:44.915
Hi.

10:44.963 --> 10:47.298
You must be Max and Han.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.828
I'm Jessica.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.828
Thanks so much for coming in.

10:50.935 --> 10:54.570
Oh, you guys are so super cute.

10:55.046 --> 10:58.749
How does our cuteness
compare to, say, a baby?

10:58.844 --> 11:00.742
Wow, you're thinking ahead.

11:00.843 --> 11:03.421
Or are you expecting a little one?

11:03.476 --> 11:06.460
Ha, I've already got a little one.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.234
What about you?

11:08.282 --> 11:11.171
Making fun of my size
is kind of our thing.

11:11.249 --> 11:13.859
Like, making sweet love.

11:18.546 --> 11:21.374
So I'm with child. Are you?

11:21.679 --> 11:22.906
Actually, I'm...

11:22.953 --> 11:23.967
So for the wedding,

11:24.054 --> 11:26.273
I was thinking of a nature theme.

11:26.558 --> 11:28.709
Something in the park,
whimsical of course,

11:28.757 --> 11:30.809
with lanterns and flowers, a big tent.

11:30.876 --> 11:32.622
Oh, oh, really?

11:32.711 --> 11:35.372
You want a big top, Pee-wee?
Jessica was talking.

11:36.325 --> 11:37.481
Sorry, dear.

11:37.529 --> 11:40.451
The old ball and chain
hates when I get a word in.

11:40.452 --> 11:43.096
Sign me up for a lifetime.

11:44.229 --> 11:46.018
Sorry, uh, I missed
what you were saying

11:46.072 --> 11:47.523
about having a baby.

11:47.626 --> 11:49.393
We're not here to talk about me.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.557
Let's talk about you and your affair.

11:51.605 --> 11:54.971
Oh, I'm definitely gonna have one.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.572
Thanks for texting, Caroline.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.932
I've been a little lost since you
made me quit my job with Ma.

12:05.041 --> 12:07.424
Mostly 'cause I
couldn't find the L train.

12:07.587 --> 12:09.952
But I saw a guy kill a chicken.

12:10.415 --> 12:12.440
I thought you and I could get together

12:12.551 --> 12:14.455
and figure out your next career move,

12:14.503 --> 12:18.471
which does not necessarily
need to be forward.

12:18.643 --> 12:20.713
No, I'm not going back to my ma's store

12:20.815 --> 12:22.596
no matter how much I
miss hiding in boxes

12:22.708 --> 12:24.213
and scaring people.

12:24.924 --> 12:28.265
Well, let's brainstorm
on your next career move.

12:28.416 --> 12:29.612
Hmm.

12:29.674 --> 12:32.924
I've always wanted to be a model.

12:33.127 --> 12:36.034
I've been told I look
great with my pants down.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.580
You are more than just a body.

12:40.737 --> 12:43.914
Hmm, sometimes I'm not so sure.

12:44.033 --> 12:45.752
Hey, what about working here?

12:45.877 --> 12:48.166
How hard can it be? You do it.

12:48.424 --> 12:49.901
Actually, this job requires a lot...

12:49.949 --> 12:51.359
You don't have to talk me into it.

12:51.407 --> 12:52.862
I'll do it.

12:53.018 --> 12:55.065
Give me the Frisbee
with the drinks on it.

12:55.861 --> 12:58.955
Okay, I guess you could help
out until Max gets back.

12:59.135 --> 13:02.034
Or until someone gets hurt,
probably me.

13:03.509 --> 13:06.252
As magic hour descends over the city,

13:06.471 --> 13:08.940
Max and I will retire
to the honeymoon suite

13:09.045 --> 13:12.010
where she carries me
over the threshold.

13:13.174 --> 13:15.432
Excited for what's to come.

13:16.580 --> 13:19.073
Well, it's not gonna be either of us.

13:22.276 --> 13:24.088
So, uh, back to you, Jess.

13:24.159 --> 13:26.182
Ooh, the party favors
could be little compasses

13:26.258 --> 13:28.487
that lead you to your table.

13:29.229 --> 13:32.293
Or to a waiting escape boat.

13:32.884 --> 13:35.410
Are you sure you two
are right for each other?

13:35.553 --> 13:37.187
Are you kidding?

13:37.301 --> 13:40.090
I am obsessed with him.

13:40.941 --> 13:44.988
We're two people madly in love.
Right, Max?

13:45.402 --> 13:47.871
Bring those lips over here and...

13:51.340 --> 13:54.394
don't forget to invite
your tongue to the party.

13:56.558 --> 13:59.293
Oh, I'm sure she can see we're in love

13:59.387 --> 14:02.683
without having to put
our mouths on each other.

14:03.113 --> 14:04.668
Please.

14:05.176 --> 14:07.074
She's shy. Once she starts,

14:07.145 --> 14:10.277
it's hard to put the
snake back in the can.

14:40.762 --> 14:43.535
Could you feel the heat
from where you are?

14:45.223 --> 14:47.238
Are you wearing lip gloss?

14:47.488 --> 14:49.949
Listen, I've been down
this road before.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.832
With a stroller?

14:51.992 --> 14:55.441
I'm just asking because
that's how I push him around.

14:55.816 --> 14:58.201
This wedding isn't making
it to the banquet hall.

14:58.249 --> 15:00.098
I don't even think it's
making it to the car.

15:00.156 --> 15:02.591
- You two should go.
- Ah.

15:02.730 --> 15:04.855
You're moody.

15:07.504 --> 15:10.191
Uh, are you pregnant?

15:10.362 --> 15:11.605
Meh?

15:11.768 --> 15:14.183
♪♪

15:19.519 --> 15:20.894
♪♪

15:21.004 --> 15:23.105
Are you sure you want the flantinis?

15:23.207 --> 15:25.558
Little tip, go buy
yourself a tub of Breyers

15:25.660 --> 15:28.965
and a bottle of vodka and
save yourself 30 bucks.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.327
Okay, let's go back over this.

15:32.433 --> 15:35.998
The job of a waitress is to get
people to buy things here.

15:36.113 --> 15:38.457
Also you're standing
on my feet right now.

15:38.613 --> 15:41.902
Are you sure?
Because I don't feel anything.

15:42.183 --> 15:45.449
Gosh, you know what?
Denise is my favorite character.

15:45.590 --> 15:47.527
I bet you she looks
like a million bucks

15:47.607 --> 15:49.566
with her pants down.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.590
You know who looks like 2 million bucks

15:51.707 --> 15:54.246
with her skirt around her ankles?

15:54.534 --> 15:56.277
How... how...

15:56.416 --> 15:59.574
How did I get so lucky?

16:02.858 --> 16:03.941
There she is,

16:04.021 --> 16:06.496
my big shot daughter who
doesn't need me anymore.

16:06.574 --> 16:09.480
And the woman who keeps
taking my babies from me.

16:10.176 --> 16:11.730
I'm getting a drink.

16:12.385 --> 16:15.168
Oh, great, now they're
all working here.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.941
Denise called my ma to
brag about her new job

16:18.074 --> 16:19.363
at your dessert bar.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.871
Bobby, I know you said
not to get involved,

16:21.940 --> 16:23.793
but I wanted to end our fight.

16:23.897 --> 16:26.949
Also, I think your sister
may have broken my pinky toe.

16:26.997 --> 16:28.035
Oh, that's my fault.

16:28.099 --> 16:30.613
I didn't teach you the stop
sign when she gets too close.

16:30.691 --> 16:32.707
Am I too close?

16:34.082 --> 16:37.090
FYI, Ma, it's going great here.

16:37.234 --> 16:38.988
Well, if things are going so great,

16:39.124 --> 16:40.637
why don't you get your own place

16:40.721 --> 16:43.004
and start toasting your own
waffles in the morning?

16:43.363 --> 16:45.098
Maybe I will.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.152
Maybe I'll move in with Caroline,

16:47.262 --> 16:49.918
and she can teach me how
to use her toaster oven.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.762
We actually have a pretty small place,

16:52.887 --> 16:54.519
and our toaster oven is being used

16:54.581 --> 16:56.808
as a tanning bed for mice.

16:57.921 --> 17:00.222
Oleg texted me this show was good.

17:00.426 --> 17:02.348
I just finished <i>The Walking Dead.</i>

17:02.396 --> 17:05.199
It hit a little too close to home.

17:06.181 --> 17:07.387
Yeah, have a seat.

17:07.656 --> 17:09.958
The crazy mom just showed up.

17:10.193 --> 17:13.348
And the hot sister is yelling at her.

17:13.746 --> 17:15.082
Caroline!

17:15.364 --> 17:18.512
I'm not being negative,
but Bobby's a dirtbag.

17:18.803 --> 17:21.441
I'm 100% sure he has, had,

17:21.577 --> 17:26.027
or is going to have
a baby with Jessica.

17:28.249 --> 17:32.558
And I'm 100% sure I'm gonna
have a cold sore in the morning.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.058
Baby? What's going on?

17:35.121 --> 17:36.762
Bobby, what is going on?

17:36.857 --> 17:40.105
This really is the golden age of TV.

17:41.387 --> 17:42.941
Max, what are you talking about?

17:42.992 --> 17:45.676
I'm talking about the
text I saw on your phone

17:45.863 --> 17:49.013
from Jessica about your baby.

17:49.747 --> 17:51.099
What are you doing with my phone?

17:51.147 --> 17:53.060
Bobby, do you have a baby with Jessica?

17:53.107 --> 17:55.240
Bobby, you have a baby with Jessica?

17:55.293 --> 17:57.911
That takes the sting
out of losing Denise.

17:58.393 --> 18:00.661
A baby? I don't have a... oh.

18:00.772 --> 18:03.122
Oh, wait. I have a cat.

18:03.188 --> 18:05.943
A cat named Baby with Jessica.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.271
Ohh.

18:07.884 --> 18:10.450
Ohhh.

18:11.779 --> 18:14.200
So what's happening around here?

18:14.905 --> 18:16.552
Why didn't you just ask me?

18:16.637 --> 18:19.599
Because I was
respecting your boundaries,

18:19.708 --> 18:22.888
which is why I stole your phone.

18:23.908 --> 18:25.130
Makes sense.

18:25.178 --> 18:26.638
Her friend here forced my daughter

18:26.722 --> 18:28.130
to abandon the family's business.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.091
Neither one of them
knows about boundaries.

18:30.260 --> 18:31.841
I'm throwing these small glasses away.

18:31.889 --> 18:33.771
They're stupid.

18:34.185 --> 18:36.357
Well, I'm pretty upset myself.

18:36.419 --> 18:41.005
I wasted $20 on the domain
name MaxAndHansWedding.com.

18:41.607 --> 18:43.740
We're not really getting married!

18:43.882 --> 18:46.284
We only went to see Jessica to find out

18:46.371 --> 18:49.286
if she had a baby
with Bobby, you boobie.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.365
You went to see Jessica?

18:51.625 --> 18:53.944
Seems like everyone's in a
fight except for me and Bobby.

18:53.991 --> 18:56.060
Oh, no, we're fighting now.

18:56.365 --> 18:57.896
I saw that text on Bobby's phone,

18:57.944 --> 18:59.405
and I didn't want you getting hurt.

18:59.452 --> 19:01.208
The only person who got hurt was me.

19:01.319 --> 19:03.630
I kissed Han on the lips.

19:03.721 --> 19:06.013
Ohhh.

19:06.227 --> 19:09.596
Max, you stalked his
ex-girlfriend without me?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.997
Pretty shady move
by your friend, Caroline.

19:12.134 --> 19:15.044
We may want to think about
finding another roommate.

19:15.271 --> 19:16.622
Okay, that's enough.

19:16.733 --> 19:19.357
Denise, you need to go
back and work for Ma,

19:19.450 --> 19:21.271
and not only because
that's the only job

19:21.342 --> 19:22.404
you're capable of doing,

19:22.452 --> 19:24.802
but also 'cause Ma's lost without you.

19:24.899 --> 19:26.693
And, Max, you need to trust

19:26.805 --> 19:28.943
that I'm not like every other dirtbag.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.443
And, Caroline, when two
people love each other,

19:31.524 --> 19:33.146
they're gonna fight.

19:34.070 --> 19:36.755
Are the two people that
love each other us?

19:36.872 --> 19:39.255
Don't get bullied into anything, Bobby.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.583
Of course I'm talking about us.

19:43.189 --> 19:45.294
I love you, Caroline.

19:49.185 --> 19:51.161
I love you, too.

19:51.349 --> 19:52.450
Great.

19:52.561 --> 19:54.429
Two white people falling in love.

19:54.515 --> 19:57.255
You don't ever see that on TV.

19:59.124 --> 20:02.060
You know what, Ma? This place is dumb.

20:02.398 --> 20:05.247
I'll come back and work at
Mail Boxes and Other Things.

20:05.466 --> 20:07.349
You know what?

20:07.550 --> 20:09.091
You're the other thing.

20:09.239 --> 20:10.904
Come here.

20:14.388 --> 20:18.138
Oleg, get the butt wipes out of my bag.

20:18.404 --> 20:20.138
This is a real tear-jerker.

20:20.238 --> 20:23.099
My second favorite kind of jerker.

20:23.934 --> 20:25.700
I should get going, too.

20:25.916 --> 20:27.427
I gotta check some text messages.

20:27.482 --> 20:30.669
And why is my screensaver
a shirtless Vin Diesel?

20:31.318 --> 20:33.193
You're welcome.

20:36.739 --> 20:38.239
You know trust is hard for me.

20:38.326 --> 20:41.083
That's why I got kicked
out of Cirque du Soleil.

20:41.794 --> 20:45.044
You're the first person in my
life I can actually count on.

20:46.169 --> 20:49.107
Be so great if they made out right now.

20:50.638 --> 20:53.607
You were the first person
I could count on, too.

20:53.810 --> 20:55.925
I love you, Max.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.175
Okay, we're not there yet.
