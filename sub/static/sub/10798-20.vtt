To bend, to make compact

05:55.813 --> 05:57.939
GROMEK:
The rendezvous will be a bit tricky,

05:58.149 --> 06:01.735
so it is imperative that you reach
the intercept point on schedule.

06:01.944 --> 06:03.445
Understood. And the mission?

The envoy will fill you in.
You are to cooperate fully.

- Admiral, can you give me any details?
GROMEK: Negative.

Admiral, it's a little difficult to prepare
for a mission l know nothing about.

06:19.587 --> 06:21.546
I sympathize, Jean-Luc,

06:21.756 --> 06:24.758
but Starfleet Command
considers this a top security matter.

06:44.695 --> 06:47.447
The envoy's aboard a class-8 probe.

06:48.658 --> 06:52.202
A class-8 probe
is just over 2 meters long.

Yes, that's true, Number One.

were removed

06:57.875 --> 07:00.585

07:00.795 --> 07:02.796
there would be just enough room
for one person.

And it is designed to travel
at warp 9.

By sending the probe to meet us,
rather than diverting the Enterprise,

07:08.428 --> 07:10.762
they are saving us 6.1 hours.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.224
Obviously, Starfleet feels
that time is of the essence.

But still, to seal someone inside
a class-8 probe and launch it off,

07:18.312 --> 07:21.398

the Klingon Empire were still at war.

its awakening point.

the Klingons they are no longer at war.

inside of me, fighting to get out.

- Of course it does.

15:48.656 --> 15:53.326
My Klingon side can be terrifying.

Not as far as l'm concerned.

According to the library computer,
the captain of the T'Ong is K'Temoc.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.744
But there is nothing
regarding the ship's mission.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.372
Probably some
secret military objective.

18:03.582 --> 18:05.458
Perhaps.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.794
But we have no evidence of that.

18:08.003 --> 18:11.631
Why else would there be no record
of the mission?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.884
The records may simply
have been lost.

18:15.094 --> 18:20.723
What does it matter? Our concern
is the present, the possible threat.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.935
And to contend with that threat,
we need information.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.438

That is foolish.

First, we find the ship
before it reaches the awakening point.

ln that case,
we simply keep the crew asleep.

- ls that feasible?
- Beam a team over to the T'Ong

33:02.063 --> 33:04.314
and override their cryogenic controls,

33:04.524 --> 33:07.985
That way we simply await
the arrival of the Klingon ship P'Rang.

when the T'Ong's crew awakens,

33:10.947 --> 33:13.073
they're surrounded
by their fellow Klingons.

33:13.282 --> 33:17.285

- But there's the second possibility

33:17.495 --> 33:20.664
that the crew of the T'Ong
has already revived.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.582
They realize
they're in Federation territory

see a Federation target, they'll attack.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.692
Could the T'Ong be disabled
rather than destroyed?

We could probably knock out
their warp-drive engines

the Klingon vessel T'Ong.

36:28.060 --> 36:30.145
ln an effort to avoid
further confrontation,

36:30.354 --> 36:33.899
we are about to implement the option
presented by Lieutenant Worf.

36:34.400 --> 36:38.320
The T'Ong has changed course
to 32, mark 81 .

36:38.529 --> 36:40.030
lncreasing to warp 3.

36:40.573 --> 36:43.491
- Standard evasive maneuver.
- Helm, stay with them.

36:43.701 --> 36:45.285
Yes, sir.

36:45.494 --> 36:48.663
The T'Ong is now on a heading
of 42, mark 1 1 3.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.999
They are accelerating to warp 5.

36:51.584 --> 36:54.961
- They're gonna make a break for it.
- Overtake. Warp 8.

36:55.546 --> 36:56.588
Aye.

36:56.797 --> 36:59.966
Now put us right in their path
and come to a full stop.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.594
- Full power to shields.
MAN: Full power, sir.

37:12.855 --> 37:15.023
Well, we've thrown down
the gauntlet.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.400
Let's see if they pick it up.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.694
They're slowing to impulse, sir.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.157
[KLAXON BLARlNG]

37:24.325 --> 37:26.201
Phaser hit on forward shields.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.037
Brimming up now. No damage.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.123
l guess we piqued their interest now.

37:32.833 --> 37:34.668
Agreed.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.754
Let's give them a chance
to look their enemy in the face.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.839
Ready, lieutenant.

37:43.052 --> 37:46.846
WORF: Open hailing frequencies.
MAN: Open, sir.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.600
What?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.978
What is this?

37:53.187 --> 37:57.357
Captain K'Temoc,
have you lost your mind?

37:57.566 --> 38:00.402
Halt your vessel
and drop your shields.

38:00.611 --> 38:03.947
What treachery is this?
By whose authority?

38:04.156 --> 38:06.658
l am Worf,
commanding the Enterprise.

38:06.867 --> 38:11.121
And it is you who have committed an
act of treason by firing on this vessel.

38:11.330 --> 38:15.417
l have standing orders
to fire on all Federation ships.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.086
You fool!

38:18.296 --> 38:22.257
Did it not occur to you
that the war would be over by now?

38:22.466 --> 38:24.467
l have no proof of that.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.637
Trust your eyes.

38:27.847 --> 38:31.516
Or is your brain still stuck
in its long slumber?

38:33.060 --> 38:35.812
How do l know
this is not a Federation trick?

38:36.022 --> 38:37.856
How can l be sure?

38:42.278 --> 38:45.822
Captain, as you are new
to this century,

38:46.032 --> 38:47.782
l have tried to be patient.

38:47.992 --> 38:51.411
But l will tolerate
no further insubordination.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.663
Drop your shields, immediately.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.249
And if l refuse?

39:00.004 --> 39:02.047
Then die in ignorance.

39:02.256 --> 39:05.133
l can waste no more time on you.

39:08.971 --> 39:11.264
- Phasers to full power.
- Aye, sir.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.017
Phasers ready. Target locked.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.190
You dare not destroy us.

39:20.399 --> 39:24.069
We are on a crucial mission
for the Klingon High Command.

39:25.112 --> 39:28.990
- Has the T'Ong dropped its shields?
MAN: No, sir.

39:29.408 --> 39:33.244
Very well. Fire all phasers.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.704
Wait!

39:45.257 --> 39:47.592
Lower the shields.

39:48.636 --> 39:53.014
l yield command of the T'Ong to you,
Captain Worf.

39:54.517 --> 39:57.435
Long live the Klingon Empire.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.563
A wise decision, captain.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.989
Commander K'Ehleyr will board
your vessel and take command.

40:10.199 --> 40:14.244
The Klingon cruiser P'Rang
will soon arrive and escort you home.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.330
And, captain.

40:18.040 --> 40:19.165
Yes?

40:19.375 --> 40:22.001
Welcome to the 24th century.

40:34.807 --> 40:37.267
l return command of the ship to you,
captain.

40:37.476 --> 40:39.686
Thank you, lieutenant.
Congratulations.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.898
A very fine first command.
Well done.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.030
How did you like command?

40:54.076 --> 40:56.035
Comfortable chair.

41:00.749 --> 41:03.334
And you wore it well.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.140
One to beam aboard the T'Ong.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.726
All set.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.604
- l relieve you.
- Wha--?

41:22.813 --> 41:24.689
Yes, lieutenant.

41:30.362 --> 41:33.823
The Klingon vessel P'Rang
will rendezvous with you in three days.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.117
ln the meantime,
l'll begin the assimilation

41:36.327 --> 41:39.662
of these Klingons to our era.

41:50.049 --> 41:52.258
ls there anything else you require?

41:54.261 --> 41:55.845
No.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.598
Nothing else.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.985
Damn you, Worf.

42:12.071 --> 42:15.823
You'd let me go without saying
another word, wouldn't you?

42:18.953 --> 42:20.954
What needs to be said?

42:22.456 --> 42:24.082
Nothing.

42:24.291 --> 42:26.167
Everything.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.546
We're about to go
our separate ways again.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.631
And that disturbs you?

42:35.761 --> 42:40.640
l hid the truth from you.
Last night did have meaning.

42:49.483 --> 42:52.569
l was tempted
to take the oath with you.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.071
That scared me.

42:56.532 --> 43:00.410
l've never had such strong feelings
toward anyone.

43:12.423 --> 43:14.340
Nor have l.

43:15.551 --> 43:18.553
Then it was more
than just a point of honor.

43:22.891 --> 43:27.520
Maybe someday,
when our paths cross again,

43:28.856 --> 43:31.858
l won't be so easy to get rid of.

44:09.521 --> 44:10.688
K'Ehleyr.

44:13.984 --> 44:17.445
l will not be complete without you.
