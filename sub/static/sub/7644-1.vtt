WEBVTT

02:57.245 --> 02:58.646
[alarm clock sounds]

03:02.182 --> 03:03.917
Ohh...

03:03.984 --> 03:05.453
I've got a feeling

03:05.519 --> 03:07.855
something special's
going to happen today.

03:11.659 --> 03:12.393
Ahh.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.528
Things to do today.

03:15.463 --> 03:17.598
"Make check mark
on paper."

03:19.032 --> 03:20.601
"Cross item out."

03:20.668 --> 03:22.803
No time for that,
I'm afraid.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.873
"And finally say,

03:25.939 --> 03:31.144
'That seems pretty senseless,
but... whatever.'"

03:31.211 --> 03:33.747
That seems
pretty senseless, but...

03:33.814 --> 03:34.815
whatever!

03:38.151 --> 03:39.920
That's odd.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.460
Joan, honey,
did you put these
trash cans on the curb?

03:46.527 --> 03:50.364
Oh, I left the trash
out overnight.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.803
Oh, dear.

03:55.869 --> 03:59.440
Oh, no.
Someone's stolen
our garbage again.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.548
Oh, I just feel
so awful about this.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.683
Darling, please.
It's not your fault.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.885
It's the world
we live in today.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.822
There are people
out there for whom
nothing is sacred,

04:14.888 --> 04:17.491
people who will steal
a man's garbage

04:17.558 --> 04:19.692
week after week
after week.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.194
We can get
through it, honey.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.196
We'll borrow some
garbage till we're
back on our feet.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.434
Don't you see, Joan?
That's exactly what
they're counting on.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.438
Whoever keeps doing this
knows that people like us
sit back and take it.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.139
I won't
take it anymore.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.309
Oh, Stanley, please.
Don't get involved.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.311
I already am involved,
Joan.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.713
Someone has stolen
from my family,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.916
and I will not rest
until I bring them
to justice.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.955
Mmm.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.128
[snores]

06:07.200 --> 06:08.769
[snoring]

06:10.270 --> 06:11.405
Huh?

06:17.511 --> 06:19.413
What in the world?

06:58.486 --> 06:59.753
They're getting away!

06:59.820 --> 07:02.189
I've got to follow them,
but how?

07:04.625 --> 07:06.093
Two wheels.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.730
Four wheels.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.501
Eight wheels.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.002
All right, crooks.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.705
Now you've got
Stanley Stupid
on your trail.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.123
Morning, Petunia.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.357
Morning, Buster.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.026
Hey, sis,
have you seen Dad?

07:39.092 --> 07:40.260
Isn't he sleeping?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.395
No. And he's not
outside, either.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.397
I got up early
to walk my fish,

07:44.464 --> 07:46.266
and he was
already gone.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.601
Do you think maybe...

07:47.668 --> 07:49.202
he's been kidnapped?

07:49.269 --> 07:53.807
Oh, my God.
We must go to
the police station!

07:53.874 --> 07:56.977
Just as soon as
we've left a note
for Mom.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.912
Hmm?

07:58.979 --> 08:00.180
Oh.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.565
Take this down.

08:19.700 --> 08:22.803
"We have gone
to the police."

08:23.871 --> 08:25.639
Po...lice.

08:25.706 --> 08:29.076
"Daddy's been
kidnapped."

08:29.142 --> 08:31.579
Kid...napped.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.548
"Don't worry.
We'll be back
soon."

08:34.615 --> 08:37.284
Signed...
"Your children."

08:37.350 --> 08:40.621
Your children.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.192
Let's move.

08:51.064 --> 08:51.999
Stanley?

08:54.101 --> 08:55.168
Buster?

08:55.235 --> 08:56.970
Petunia?

08:59.206 --> 09:00.540
Stanley?

09:00.608 --> 09:01.541
Buster?

09:01.609 --> 09:03.143
Petunia?

09:03.210 --> 09:05.078
Where is everybody?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.486
It's impossible!

09:13.553 --> 09:15.555
It can't be true.

09:15.623 --> 09:18.491
[phone rings]

09:18.558 --> 09:19.526
Hello?

09:19.593 --> 09:22.062
Hello, is this
Mrs. Stupid?

09:22.129 --> 09:22.996
Yes.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.132
I'm calling from
the police station,

09:25.198 --> 09:26.199
Mrs. Stupid.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.436
We, uh, have your
children here,
ma'am.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.839
Oh, my God, it's true!

09:31.905 --> 09:34.875
The police have kidnapped
my children!

09:55.328 --> 09:56.997
You two just sit
tight.

09:57.064 --> 09:59.933
We'll have you home
in a minute.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.143
[car horn blares]

10:22.622 --> 10:25.258
OK, mister.
It's your turn now!

10:40.874 --> 10:44.177
- [children] Bye! Bye! Bye!
- [Stanley] Bye!

10:47.314 --> 10:48.749
Mom?

10:50.317 --> 10:51.919
Mom?

10:53.086 --> 10:54.087
Mom!

10:59.659 --> 11:00.761
Mom?

11:00.828 --> 11:02.495
It's no use.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.264
Mom's gone, too.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.001
And we seem to be caught
in a deadly game
of cat and mouse.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.117
He left without
even ringing the bell.

11:24.184 --> 11:28.055
Apparently,
he only wanted us
to find this.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.025
What's
the Jade Palace?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.694
And what does it
have to do with
Dad and Mom?

11:34.762 --> 11:36.096
I don't know,
Petunia.

11:36.163 --> 11:38.331
But it's time
we went there
and found out.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.641
Friday. June fourth.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.044
Today my world
turned upside down.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.446
First, I discovered
my husband missing.

11:53.513 --> 11:57.650
Then, I learned my children had
been kidnapped by the police.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.022
Now the fate of my family
rests in my hands.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.026
Note to self.

12:06.093 --> 12:08.428
I must buy hand-held
tape recorder.

12:08.495 --> 12:12.232
Then I will no longer
be speaking into
the garage door opener.

12:21.108 --> 12:24.912
Some people can be
so inconsiderate!

12:36.756 --> 12:38.425
Just the two of you?

12:38.491 --> 12:41.061
Why... yes.

12:41.128 --> 12:45.098
So they have been
expecting us.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.775
Ohh... oh.

13:16.763 --> 13:18.331
And what can I
get for you?

13:18.398 --> 13:21.568
Oh, I think you've got
a pretty good idea

13:21.634 --> 13:23.136
what we're looking
for.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.906
May I recommend
the cashew chicken?

13:25.973 --> 13:28.909
You'll get your cash
when we get our
parents back.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.878
And don't
call us chicken.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.941
Oh, no. The truck!

14:01.008 --> 14:02.542
It's gone!

14:02.609 --> 14:04.111
I've lost it!

14:04.177 --> 14:06.413
Now it could be
anywhere!

14:06.479 --> 14:11.184
Finding it now would be
like finding a needle
in a haystack!

14:18.091 --> 14:19.859
[engine starts]

14:27.367 --> 14:30.938
It's always the last place
you think of lookin'.

14:45.585 --> 14:48.788
I'll never get
the hang of these things.

14:48.855 --> 14:51.591
Still no sign
of Mom or Dad.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.293
I don't get it,
Buster.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.429
Don't worry, Petunia.
Whoever brought us here
will contact us

14:56.496 --> 14:58.631
when the time is right.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.408
Buster,
it's a message!

15:10.243 --> 15:14.047
"Time flies when
you're having fun."

15:14.114 --> 15:16.984
"Time flies
when you're having fun"?

15:17.050 --> 15:18.818
Wait a minute!

15:18.885 --> 15:22.289
Isn't the Daily Times
published just a few
blocks away?

15:22.355 --> 15:23.290
Yes!

15:23.356 --> 15:25.792
At the corner of
Fun Street and Fly!

15:25.858 --> 15:28.261
No, it's Maple
and Fifth.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.930
Close enough.
Let's move.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.473
OK. Camouflage lesson
number one.

15:40.540 --> 15:44.444
To look like a bush,
you have to think like a bush.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.349
OK. Here I am
just being a bush,

15:49.416 --> 15:51.484
just growin'
and hangin' out.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.487
Yes, this is
the life for me.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.690
Sure is a lot of soil
around here.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.426
A lot of sunshine, too.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.362
As a bush,
I notice these things.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.631
Wait a minute.
What's this?

16:04.697 --> 16:06.633
I have arms.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.635
I am a bush with arms!

16:08.701 --> 16:10.437
And legs!

16:10.503 --> 16:15.042
I am the first bush
in history with legs!

16:15.108 --> 16:17.744
I can walk!

16:17.810 --> 16:20.313
[grunts]

16:24.384 --> 16:26.786
Oh, gaze ye unbelievers
upon this miracle.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.488
This walking bush--

16:28.555 --> 16:29.722
half man, half plant--

16:29.789 --> 16:32.825
he dwells in two worlds
but is the master of both!

16:32.892 --> 16:34.394
Oh, man-bush,

16:34.461 --> 16:37.297
you are nature's
greatest wonder!

16:43.570 --> 16:45.004
[engine starts]

16:48.375 --> 16:51.378
Poor fools
thought I was a bush.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.383
I'll lock up the bikes.
You keep a lookout.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.391
Let's move.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.369
[gasps]
My children!

17:24.144 --> 17:27.414
[car horns blaring]

17:28.315 --> 17:29.416
What's the matter
with you?!

17:29.482 --> 17:31.484
You don't know
how to drive?!

17:38.024 --> 17:39.092
Police.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.427
If they recognize me,

17:40.493 --> 17:43.096
they're sure to
kidnap me, too.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.298
What to do?

17:56.776 --> 17:57.877
My gosh!

17:57.944 --> 18:01.047
There must be thousands
of people's garbage here.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.882
Tens of thousands, even.

18:02.949 --> 18:08.388
Why, the sheer organization
necessary to pull off
a heist like this...

18:08.455 --> 18:11.424
I've uncovered the crime
of the century!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.672
Good day, officers.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.513
Yes!

19:07.314 --> 19:09.849
Is that everyone?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.584
Affirmative, sir.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.353
It's show time.

19:23.129 --> 19:24.597
Welcome, gentlemen.

19:26.566 --> 19:30.069
I apologize
for the unpleasantness
of our surroundings.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.705
The setting was chosen
for its seclusion,

19:32.772 --> 19:34.541
not its beauty.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.479
The weapons
you are about to see

19:39.546 --> 19:42.815
are American-made,
and, I humbly submit,

19:42.882 --> 19:44.684
the world's best.

19:53.125 --> 19:56.696
International law has long
kept you from acquiring them,

19:56.763 --> 19:58.097
but as of now,

19:58.164 --> 20:01.100
I hope to help you
overcome that.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.969
Lieutenant.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.507
The first piece of equipment
we'd like to demonstrate

20:07.574 --> 20:09.742
is the dragon
anti-tank missile.

20:11.077 --> 20:15.348
Whether you want to foment
revolution or suppress it,

20:15.415 --> 20:18.318
this hardware
will help you get it done.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.120
Strange, indeed,
are the workings of fate.

20:21.187 --> 20:22.922
How could I have known
that today I would wander

20:22.989 --> 20:27.727
into the jaws of some kind
of super-crime?

20:27.794 --> 20:29.396
Pardon me.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.399
Chances are,
my life is already in danger,

20:32.465 --> 20:34.534
yet I feel strangely,
intensely alive.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.537
Every nerve is alert,
every sense working overtime.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.307
Nothing escapes my eye.

20:43.142 --> 20:45.345
[laughs]
'Scuse me.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.282
One journey
has come to an end,

20:49.349 --> 20:53.920
but I've got a feeling
the real adventure
has just begun.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.900
Buster, Petunia!

21:07.967 --> 21:09.702
Aah!
Aah!

21:09.769 --> 21:11.871
It's some kind of
ape woman!

21:11.938 --> 21:13.340
Oh, no. It's me.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.508
Your mother!

21:15.575 --> 21:18.077
Your mother's
some kind of
ape woman?!

21:18.144 --> 21:21.348
No, no. Children,
it's a disguise.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.352
They're wigs.

21:25.418 --> 21:28.555
- Ah!
- Ah!

21:29.622 --> 21:32.158
Next up
is an updated version

21:32.224 --> 21:34.427
of the .45-caliber
personal sidearm.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.704
I think you'll appreciate
the increase in stopping power.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.501
Here we have
the traditional

22:14.567 --> 22:16.536
M16 assault weapon

22:16.603 --> 22:18.538
with extra-new capabilities.

22:18.605 --> 22:20.540
Not only will it fire...

22:20.607 --> 22:23.376
excuse me.
You got a pen
I could borrow?

22:26.212 --> 22:28.147
[speaking
foreign language]

22:28.214 --> 22:29.482
Thank you very much.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.551
So what's going on
around here,

22:31.618 --> 22:33.152
some kind of
company picnic?

22:33.219 --> 22:34.487
[speaking
foreign language]

22:34.554 --> 22:37.657
Why, that's a very
festive name for it.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.792
Notice all that garbage
out there?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.093
It's all stolen.

22:42.261 --> 22:43.963
There's something fishy
going on.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.533
Frankly, our lives may
already be in danger.

22:46.599 --> 22:47.800
[shouts in foreign language]

22:47.867 --> 22:48.901
I hear ya, pal.

22:48.968 --> 22:50.770
At first I was pretty
tongue-tied myself.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.109
Oh, Jerry, help.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.946
I need a new headline
for the entertainment
section.

23:00.012 --> 23:02.949
"HBO has given the order
for a pair of original,

23:03.015 --> 23:06.085
outer-space themed shows
for the new season."

23:06.152 --> 23:08.421
Let's see.
What about...

23:12.358 --> 23:15.294
"Two alien pilots
picked up by network."

23:15.361 --> 23:16.228
Perfect.

23:16.295 --> 23:18.565
I'm sending it.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.735
Hey, you guys,
give me a hand
in metro, will ya?

23:22.802 --> 23:26.005
We were supposed to be
in print five minutes ago.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.177
Psst!

23:31.243 --> 23:32.579
Sis, over here.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.180
I found a computer.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.986
What have you got
in mind, Petunia?

23:40.052 --> 23:42.922
A little ride
on the information
super highway, Mom.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.857
In this age
of microtechnology,

23:44.924 --> 23:47.760
the computer's our gateway
to information.

23:47.827 --> 23:51.097
Now all we've gotta do
is figure out the password.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.873
How about nose?

24:00.940 --> 24:03.009
It's worth a try!

24:05.612 --> 24:07.547
All right, computer,

24:07.614 --> 24:10.983
now tell us everything
we need to know about...

24:11.050 --> 24:13.052
Stanley...

24:13.119 --> 24:15.555
Stupid.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.457
Relax, soldier.

24:18.525 --> 24:21.160
A week from now,
we'll both be
wealthy men.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.495
I suppose so, sir.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.296
But I can't help
wondering

24:24.363 --> 24:28.167
what our country
would think of
what we're doing.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.970
This year
our country

24:31.037 --> 24:33.573
refused my promotion,
Lieutenant.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.943
They have only
themselves
to blame now.

24:40.847 --> 24:43.716
You really think
we can pull this off?

24:45.652 --> 24:48.320
I gave my life
to the military.

24:48.387 --> 24:51.991
Nothing's gonna stop me
from getting something back.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.363
Sir, I think
we have a potential
situation.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.998
What is it, soldier?

24:59.065 --> 25:01.133
An individual appears
to have infiltrated
the proceedings.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.336
As far as we can tell,
he's not affiliated with
any of the buyers.

25:04.403 --> 25:07.640
It's the CIA.
We're probably
already surrounded.

25:07.707 --> 25:10.877
Negative, sir.
He appears to be
alone.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.144
Alone?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.445
Hmm.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.616
Just what kinda
cowboy agent is this guy?

25:30.863 --> 25:33.700
No one is to disturb him
without my order.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.502
The buyers must not know
anything is amiss.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.705
[choked voice]
Understood, sir.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.477
If I know my business,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.980
the operative
will contact us.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.528
To walk into
a situation like this

26:02.595 --> 26:03.963
without support...

26:04.030 --> 26:06.198
this guy must be
fearless.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.200
Yes.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.778
And very, very smart.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.884
"Business, weather,
sports."

26:24.951 --> 26:27.186
What is it trying
to tell us?

26:27.253 --> 26:28.554
It's computer jargon, Mom.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.791
It's like a whole
different language.

26:31.858 --> 26:33.525
Now hand me a photo of Dad,

26:33.592 --> 26:36.829
and let's see what
we can find out.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.201
It's processing the data.

26:46.739 --> 26:47.674
What does it say?

26:47.740 --> 26:48.908
"Fatal error...

26:48.975 --> 26:50.677
Drive B."

26:50.743 --> 26:52.278
Oh, my God!

26:52.344 --> 26:53.245
What does it mean?

26:53.312 --> 26:54.413
I don't know!

26:54.480 --> 26:56.649
We've
got to warn
your father.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.152
Whoa!

27:00.219 --> 27:01.253
Wha!

27:01.320 --> 27:02.254
Oh!

27:02.321 --> 27:03.255
Oh!

27:03.322 --> 27:04.456
Look out!

27:04.523 --> 27:05.925
Let's go!

27:07.559 --> 27:09.495
We'd better
get outta here.

27:09.561 --> 27:10.930
Let's go!

27:12.531 --> 27:14.366
[excited yelling]

27:26.345 --> 27:27.980
Our bikes are gone!

27:31.217 --> 27:33.419
And the cops have
surrounded my car!

27:33.485 --> 27:35.421
Run for your lives!

27:58.544 --> 28:00.713
[classical music plays]

28:00.780 --> 28:02.314

28:09.722 --> 28:12.258

[feminine sigh]

28:31.677 --> 28:34.947

28:43.689 --> 28:45.091
Whoa!

28:46.292 --> 28:47.226
Wow!

28:56.702 --> 28:59.371
[alien language]
...Stanley Stupid!

29:12.218 --> 29:14.353
Cool runnings,
my brother.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.324
Bye. Thank you.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.361
[speaks foreign language]

29:36.008 --> 29:37.576
Hi. Stanley Stupid.

29:37.643 --> 29:39.011
Oh.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.014
Honored to make
your acquaintance,
Mr. Stupid.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.616
You must be
a highly skilled
investigator

29:44.683 --> 29:46.618
to have discovered
all of this.

29:46.685 --> 29:48.620
Actually, I knew
I was on the trail

29:48.687 --> 29:50.422
of some pretty
crafty thieves,

29:50.489 --> 29:54.026
but I had no idea
there would be this
much garbage out here.

29:54.093 --> 29:57.096
You are clearly
an agent of
enormous talents.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.832
It's a shame
the government
will never reward you

29:59.899 --> 30:01.200
as richly
as you deserve.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.435
No. The government
doesn't even know
I'm here!

30:03.502 --> 30:06.839
Ah. And that's why
you've approached me,
isn't it?

30:06.906 --> 30:08.841
To come and get
your share,

30:08.908 --> 30:10.709
one way or another?

30:10.776 --> 30:11.978
Actually, mister,

30:12.044 --> 30:14.446
I've approached you
because I need a car.

30:14.513 --> 30:18.317
Lieutenant,
give our friend
the keys to my car.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.454
A gift to the gifted.

30:22.521 --> 30:23.990
Well, thank you
very much!

30:24.056 --> 30:25.657
That's incredibly
generous!

30:25.724 --> 30:28.060
Thanks a lot!

30:30.062 --> 30:33.399
And to think I just
wanted a ride back to town!

30:35.734 --> 30:38.004
Thanks, everybody!
I'll see ya!

30:46.145 --> 30:47.880
Talk about
nerves of steel...

30:47.947 --> 30:50.849
completely surrounded,
and he didn't even blink.

30:50.917 --> 30:52.584
We bought him off
for now, sir,

30:52.651 --> 30:55.354
but what's to stop him
from turning us in
anyway?

30:55.421 --> 30:57.623
You are, soldier.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.025
Without disturbing
our clients,

30:59.091 --> 31:00.960
follow, then terminate
the target

31:01.027 --> 31:02.628
with extreme
prejudice.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.496
Yes, sir!

31:08.300 --> 31:09.601
Meaning?

31:09.668 --> 31:11.403
Kill him.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.504
Right.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.510
Oh!

31:18.577 --> 31:19.946
Boy...

31:20.012 --> 31:22.915
you never realize
how many policemen
there are

31:22.982 --> 31:25.484
until the day they
turn against you.

31:25.551 --> 31:28.254
This is the biggest
emergency of our lives,

31:28.320 --> 31:30.322
and we can't even call 9-1-1!

31:30.389 --> 31:34.060
A crisis like this
calls for even
a higher authority.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.263
Mom, dial 10-1-1.

31:37.329 --> 31:40.066
I'm afraid that's not
good enough, children.

31:40.132 --> 31:43.469
Your father's life
is on the line.

31:43.535 --> 31:46.973
I'm calling 75,496-1-1.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.545
[phone ringing]

31:55.747 --> 31:56.949
Yeah.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.684
Hello. My name
is Joan Stupid.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.387
I'm a housewife,
and I desperately
need your help.

32:01.453 --> 32:04.290
Let me guess, lady.
You've had a hectic
day runnin' around

32:04.356 --> 32:05.857
taking care of
the kids,

32:05.924 --> 32:08.360
and now you're panicked
'cause your husband's
due home.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.595
That's right!

32:09.661 --> 32:11.497
And you haven't
had time to cook
dinner, right?

32:11.563 --> 32:14.033
That's right, too!

32:15.334 --> 32:17.403
I hear it every day
of the week.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.705
You need
our family special.
What's your address?

32:19.771 --> 32:21.307
55 maple street.

32:21.373 --> 32:24.576
Uh-huh. And does
your family like
coleslaw?

32:24.643 --> 32:26.378
Yes.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.580
That's all
the information
I need.

32:28.647 --> 32:32.084
Relax. We'll have
you taken care of in
less than an hour.

32:32.151 --> 32:33.685
Oh, bless you!

32:33.752 --> 32:35.487
No need to worry, kids.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.690
The most sophisticated
emergency response team
in the world

32:38.757 --> 32:40.892
is working with us now.

32:40.959 --> 32:45.031
Interestingly enough,
their strategy
involves coleslaw.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.300
[phone rings]

32:48.367 --> 32:49.335
Hello?

32:51.237 --> 32:52.671
Hi, honey. It's me.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.173
Oh, Stanley!

32:55.007 --> 32:56.508
Darling,
are you all right?

32:56.575 --> 32:59.311
I'm fine. But you won't
believe the things
I've uncovered.

32:59.378 --> 33:01.447
Stanley, listen
to me closely.

33:01.513 --> 33:05.084
You must beware
of the Drive B.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.553
What's
the Drive Bee?

33:07.619 --> 33:09.455
We... don't know.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.890
But any error
you make with it
could be fatal!

33:11.957 --> 33:15.461
Just as I suspected.
My life may already
be in jeopardy.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.077
What are you saying?

33:31.143 --> 33:33.245
There must be some kind
of interference.

33:33.312 --> 33:35.647
Hold on.
I'll turn down
the radio.

33:40.352 --> 33:41.353
Oops.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.258
[screams]

33:47.226 --> 33:48.760
Whoo! Hot!

33:52.398 --> 33:53.699
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

33:53.765 --> 33:54.700
Uh-oh!

33:59.805 --> 34:00.739
Oh, hot!

34:00.806 --> 34:01.773
Ooh!

34:04.943 --> 34:08.447
Is there something
about Dad that
you're not telling us,

34:08.514 --> 34:09.815
something
about his past...

34:09.880 --> 34:12.650
that would help explain
what's going on?

34:16.088 --> 34:18.690
Children, I suppose
you're old enough

34:18.757 --> 34:20.692
to know the truth.

34:20.759 --> 34:22.694
And the truth is...

34:22.761 --> 34:24.362
your father...

34:24.429 --> 34:27.099
once worked inside
the system.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.065
You mean...

34:28.134 --> 34:29.735
that's right, Petunia.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.103
Stanley Stupid
was a courier

34:32.170 --> 34:34.206
for the U.S. Government.

34:35.341 --> 34:38.310
At first it seemed like
the perfect job.

34:39.978 --> 34:43.715
Every day brought new
and fascinating challenges.

34:43.782 --> 34:44.815
Oh, great!

34:48.085 --> 34:49.521
There you go.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.428
537.

35:00.732 --> 35:02.334
537.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.671
[grinding]

35:46.245 --> 35:48.780
[Joan] Then, one day...

35:48.847 --> 35:51.183
your father
discovered something.

35:52.184 --> 35:53.452
Thank you.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.603
That's odd.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.541
Come in.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.417
What is it now,
Stanley?

36:25.484 --> 36:26.885
Something
very strange, sir.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.888
It seems like
an incredible
amount of letters

36:29.955 --> 36:32.791
are being delivered
to somebody
named "Sender."

36:32.858 --> 36:33.959
Who is this "Sender"?

36:34.025 --> 36:37.496
And what is he
doing with other
people's mail?

36:37.563 --> 36:40.098
I believe that this
calls for

36:40.165 --> 36:42.501
a full-scale
investigation.

36:44.102 --> 36:47.105
The next day,
he was fired.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.875
They never told him why.

36:50.976 --> 36:52.311
But of course!

36:52.378 --> 36:53.645
He knew too much!

36:53.712 --> 36:55.847
And my instinct
tells me...

36:55.914 --> 36:59.718
we haven't seen
the last of
Mr. Sender.

37:00.786 --> 37:04.856
[men chanting]

37:06.425 --> 37:08.494
[phone rings]

37:08.560 --> 37:10.329
Is the target
neutralized?

37:10.396 --> 37:12.331
I'm afraid not, sir.

37:12.398 --> 37:15.100
It seems the enemy
repelled our assault team

37:15.166 --> 37:16.902
with extreme
defensive aggression

37:16.968 --> 37:20.339
in a... blowing-up-
their-car manner, sir.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.941
So... he has
some combat skills

37:23.008 --> 37:24.743
to back up
his bravado.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.145
Who do we have
from Special Ops?

37:27.212 --> 37:29.481
McClellan trained
with the S.O.F., sir.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.949
Give him the assignment.

37:31.016 --> 37:34.853
Let's see how our friend
handles a veteran
assassin.

38:01.980 --> 38:03.248
Ready?

38:03.315 --> 38:05.551
Ready.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.487
It's high time
I got myself
another tattoo.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.823
Just make sure
you do it clean.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.426
We can't afford
to leave a trail
of clues.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.995
He'll never know
what hit him.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.831
Did you know
you had a hole
in your gas tank?

38:19.898 --> 38:22.834
Actually, that's how
you get the gas in it.

38:22.901 --> 38:26.405
Listen, top her off.
I'm gonna go freshen up.

39:13.585 --> 39:16.722
Thank you for
the excellent
service, old timer.

39:16.788 --> 39:18.123
Yep.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.803
[screaming]

39:35.607 --> 39:37.743
[chickens clucking]

39:47.018 --> 39:48.386
[phone rings]

39:48.454 --> 39:49.354
Well?

39:49.421 --> 39:51.056
I'm afraid
it's bad news.

39:51.122 --> 39:53.459
Don't tell me
he took out
McClellan, too!

39:53.525 --> 39:54.926
It's uncanny, sir.

39:54.993 --> 39:57.529
I've watched him
dispatch assailants
effortlessly

39:57.596 --> 39:59.565
with techniques that...

39:59.631 --> 40:01.366
that defy description.

40:01.433 --> 40:03.569
Who's our
explosives expert?

40:03.635 --> 40:05.303
That would be
Martinez, sir.

40:05.370 --> 40:07.973
Give him the assignment
and everything he needs
to pull it off.

40:08.039 --> 40:11.843
I want it done surgical
and I want it done now!

40:11.910 --> 40:14.980
For God's sake,
we're military men.

40:15.046 --> 40:18.484
Killing people
is supposed to be our job.

40:52.951 --> 40:55.053
[bee buzzing]

40:59.090 --> 41:00.626
Go on!

41:00.692 --> 41:02.961
Please, leave me alone.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.040
What are you
trying to do, you darn bee?

41:15.106 --> 41:17.809
Can'tcha see
I'm trying to drive?

41:17.876 --> 41:19.745
Oh, my god!
The Drive Bee!

41:28.654 --> 41:31.590
Fight, Stanley!
Fight for your life!

41:39.230 --> 41:41.199
The tables have turned.

41:42.534 --> 41:45.604
The hunter
becomes the hunted.

41:53.478 --> 41:54.946
Mission
accomplished.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.549
No one could have
survived that blast.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.690
Now, that's a well-made shoe.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.601
Here's your fare
and a little extra
for yourself.

42:15.667 --> 42:17.803
Thank you, sir.
What's the occasion?

42:17.869 --> 42:20.105
It's just good
to be home.

42:28.113 --> 42:29.080
Home.

42:29.147 --> 42:32.183
You never know
how much it means to you

42:32.250 --> 42:34.052
till you go away.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.557
What are you doing
to my grass?

42:39.625 --> 42:41.192
Buster?

42:41.259 --> 42:42.661
Is that you?

42:43.929 --> 42:45.563
Have I been away
so long?

42:45.631 --> 42:47.298
You live next door,
Stanley.

42:47.365 --> 42:49.067
Please, call me "Dad."

42:49.134 --> 42:50.769
Dad!

42:53.071 --> 42:56.174
This day keeps getting
stranger and stranger.

42:56.241 --> 42:59.410
We find ourselves today
at the center of a puzzle.

42:59.477 --> 43:02.380
At first,
all is confusing.

43:02.447 --> 43:05.984
But as the pieces
come together, patterns emerge,

43:06.051 --> 43:07.986
and before long
we can see

43:08.053 --> 43:10.288
the sinister face
of conspiracy.

43:12.123 --> 43:15.794
And it all begins
with a man named...

43:26.171 --> 43:27.639
Mr. Sender.

43:30.475 --> 43:32.644
[organ plays]

43:32.711 --> 43:35.814
[ominous chorus sings]

43:46.291 --> 43:47.358
Letters...

43:47.425 --> 43:49.861
easier to open than
pistachios.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.630
What's inside...

43:52.698 --> 43:54.933
is more delicious.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.104
"If you still love me,
Sally,

43:59.170 --> 44:02.507
tie a ribbon
'round the old oak tree."

44:02.573 --> 44:04.309
I'm afraid the only thing

44:04.375 --> 44:07.578
that's going to be
hanging from that tree is you...

44:07.645 --> 44:09.114
"Bob."

44:16.254 --> 44:17.823
Poor Jenny Miller.

44:20.058 --> 44:22.127
Nobody coming
to her wedding.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.936
This postal ploy
of yours

44:31.002 --> 44:33.604
is the most evil
caper of our age,
Mr. Sender.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.540
How will you ever
top yourself?

44:35.606 --> 44:37.342
With a crime
so unthinkable

44:37.408 --> 44:40.611
that no one has ever
dared to attempt it:

44:40.678 --> 44:43.214
to rob an entire nation

44:43.281 --> 44:45.116
of its garbage.

44:45.183 --> 44:49.187
The one resource
no one ever thinks
to protect.

44:49.254 --> 44:50.421
Yet, without it,

44:50.488 --> 44:53.024
every hefty bag,
every trash compactor,

44:53.091 --> 44:55.226
every rubbish bin
in America

44:55.293 --> 44:56.627
will be useless.

44:56.694 --> 44:58.629
Desperate men
will roam the streets

44:58.696 --> 45:00.398
with empty waste baskets.

45:00.465 --> 45:03.401
Panic and chaos
will rule the land.

45:03.468 --> 45:07.405
The precious balance
of civilization
will be destroyed,

45:07.472 --> 45:13.211
and then the world
will come begging
for mercy...

45:13.278 --> 45:14.946
to me.

45:17.682 --> 45:20.018
Your job
is to kidnap anyone

45:20.085 --> 45:23.121
who discovers
my diabolical plan...

45:24.990 --> 45:26.858
including children.

45:32.097 --> 45:35.200
This fiendishness
must be stopped!

45:44.642 --> 45:46.778
It's not our battle
to fight.

45:46.845 --> 45:51.049
We've got enough trouble
getting soy sauce into
these tiny packets.

45:51.116 --> 45:53.118
Maybe we can't stop
sender,

45:53.184 --> 45:55.053
but I know someone
who can,

45:55.120 --> 45:58.523
a bright fellow
I worked with in
the postal service.

45:58.589 --> 46:00.358
Are the guards
posted out front?

46:00.425 --> 46:01.927
Only the best.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.466
[dialing phone]

46:08.533 --> 46:09.700
Well?

46:09.767 --> 46:12.070
No one suspects
a thing, Mr. Sender...

46:12.137 --> 46:14.873
unless that bush
has ears.

46:22.413 --> 46:26.351
The joke's on you,
my friends.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.752
Bad news, sir.

46:27.819 --> 46:30.021
Stanley Stupid
has discovered
our secret.

46:30.088 --> 46:34.625
At last, a foe worthy
of matching wits with!

46:34.692 --> 46:37.996
Release the Drive Bee!

47:04.055 --> 47:07.525
[sinister laughter]

47:12.063 --> 47:15.466
So you see,
it all begins with Mr...

47:18.536 --> 47:19.938
Sender.

47:20.005 --> 47:21.606
But the police
are against us,

47:21.672 --> 47:24.042
and obviously we can't
go to the press.

47:24.109 --> 47:26.811
What are we
going to do,
Stanley?

47:26.878 --> 47:29.414
We've got to take on
Sender ourselves!

47:30.848 --> 47:33.418
Oh, it won't be easy
finding him,

47:33.484 --> 47:36.021
scouring the countryside
for microscopic clues,

47:36.087 --> 47:39.024
following trails
that are long-since cold,

47:39.090 --> 47:41.026
sensing him always nearby,

47:41.092 --> 47:44.229
yet somehow maddeningly
beyond our grasp.

47:44.295 --> 47:45.263
Hey!

47:45.330 --> 47:48.033
There's a Charles Sender
listed right here

47:48.099 --> 47:49.500
in this phone book.

47:49.567 --> 47:51.436
The manhunt begins.

48:04.482 --> 48:06.051
The car won't start!

48:06.117 --> 48:07.986
Maybe the battery's
dead.

48:08.053 --> 48:10.288
It was
perfectly healthy
this afternoon.

48:10.355 --> 48:12.958
Maybe it's got
some life left in it.

48:13.024 --> 48:15.260
I'd better give it
mouth-to-mouth.

48:17.963 --> 48:19.965
[barking]

48:23.434 --> 48:26.671
Not now, kitty.
I've got a battery
to revive.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.382
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?

48:37.448 --> 48:40.451
I've cooked up some insane
conspiracy theory

48:40.518 --> 48:43.388
and put myself in the middle
of an illegal weapons deal

48:43.454 --> 48:45.390
with some of the world's
most dangerous men.

48:45.456 --> 48:48.459
I've risked my life
and the lives of my family

48:48.526 --> 48:52.430
in a scheme that makes
absolutely no sense at all.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.465
Insight fading.

48:54.532 --> 48:57.635
I must remember
not to go forward with this.

48:57.702 --> 49:01.306
What is it, Stanley?
What are you supposed
to remember?

49:01.372 --> 49:02.373
Um...

49:04.609 --> 49:06.311
I don't know.

49:06.377 --> 49:09.514
[barking]

49:09.580 --> 49:10.581
[whistles]

49:13.918 --> 49:16.421
Let's go, everybody.
We got a job to do!

49:16.487 --> 49:18.023
[whimpers]

49:32.503 --> 49:35.506
Hey, what about
the delivery?!

49:35.573 --> 49:40.511
You can't just order food
and run off like that!

49:40.578 --> 49:44.615
You have insulted the dignity
of Floyd's Delicatessen.

49:55.293 --> 49:57.495
You're sure
this is the place?

49:57.562 --> 49:58.329
Oh, yes.

49:58.396 --> 50:00.331
When I called Sender's
home,

50:00.398 --> 50:03.468
his wife said
that he works here.

50:03.534 --> 50:06.171
A likely story.

50:07.372 --> 50:08.506
Ha!

50:16.514 --> 50:19.484
OK, Joan.
You and Buster search
that end of the building.

50:19.550 --> 50:22.087
Petunia and I
will take this end.

50:22.153 --> 50:24.722
And remember, everybody,
use your heads.

50:47.778 --> 50:49.080
[thud]
Oh!

50:57.788 --> 50:59.224
[crash]

51:25.583 --> 51:28.119
[whispers]
I found his headquarters!

51:29.720 --> 51:33.090
And I've stumbled upon
his fiendish laboratory!

51:40.598 --> 51:42.233
Careful, Petunia.

51:42.300 --> 51:44.769
One false move,
and we could end up dead.

51:49.140 --> 51:50.074
Dad?

51:50.141 --> 51:51.876
Petunia!

51:51.942 --> 51:53.944
Everything's
gone dark.

51:54.011 --> 51:55.946
I can't see a thing!

51:56.013 --> 51:59.350
Oh, my God,
it's happened!

52:00.084 --> 52:01.886
We're dead.

52:03.053 --> 52:04.789
I knew it!

52:16.701 --> 52:18.436
So this is heaven.

52:18.503 --> 52:20.771
It's quite lovely,
really.

52:23.107 --> 52:24.442
Funny, isn't it?

52:24.509 --> 52:26.511
One minute
you're tracking down

52:26.577 --> 52:28.446
the head of a global
conspiracy,

52:28.513 --> 52:31.782
and the next minute,
poof-- it's all over.

52:32.983 --> 52:34.552
Sure puts things
in perspective.

52:34.619 --> 52:37.722
You know who I miss
the most?

52:37.788 --> 52:39.857
Mom and Buster.

52:39.924 --> 52:41.259
Don't worry, honey.

52:41.326 --> 52:43.528
They'll be joining us
soon enough...

52:43.594 --> 52:45.763
the way your mom
drives.

52:47.097 --> 52:48.299
[man] Hello.

52:48.366 --> 52:49.700
Somebody in here?

52:49.767 --> 52:51.636
Dad, someone's coming!

52:53.204 --> 52:54.839
You think?

52:56.807 --> 52:59.009
Yes, Petunia.

52:59.076 --> 53:01.279
It's time to meet
our creator.

53:07.151 --> 53:08.753
Hail to thee,
oh, Lord.

53:08.819 --> 53:12.457
Actually,
it's pronounced Lloyd.

53:14.392 --> 53:17.595
All these years
we've been saying it wrong.

53:25.169 --> 53:26.504
So...

53:26.571 --> 53:30.375
this is the face of evil.

53:44.989 --> 53:49.727
And this is the diary
of his twisted schemes!

53:58.202 --> 54:00.705
Dates, numbers?

54:00.771 --> 54:02.307
Years?

54:04.041 --> 54:06.344
What in the world?

54:07.745 --> 54:08.679
Buster, come on.

54:08.746 --> 54:10.881
I found out where
sender's going next.

54:10.948 --> 54:12.216
Just a minute, Mom.

54:12.283 --> 54:14.452
I've discovered
a mysterious room here.

54:14.519 --> 54:17.888
There's a strange-looking
clock over the top of it.

54:20.591 --> 54:23.461
And a control panel
with a bunch of numbers.

54:23.528 --> 54:26.731
One would almost think
it's some kinda...

54:26.797 --> 54:28.399
time machine!

54:33.671 --> 54:34.605
Mom!

54:34.672 --> 54:35.840
Help!

54:35.906 --> 54:37.508
Buster, no!

54:42.112 --> 54:43.348
[dull thud]

54:46.617 --> 54:48.686
What buttons
did you press?

54:48.753 --> 54:50.154
I don't know.

54:50.220 --> 54:52.557
Just a bunch of
random numbers,

54:52.623 --> 54:54.759
and the letters
"B-C."

54:54.825 --> 54:56.461
Oh, my God!

55:22.687 --> 55:26.323
We've traveled back
to the age of the dinosaurs!

55:32.897 --> 55:36.133
It's just so amazing
to meet you at last!

55:36.200 --> 55:37.702
Well, thank you.

55:37.768 --> 55:41.038
It's nice to meet
someone who appreciates
the work I do.

55:41.105 --> 55:42.473
Appreciates it?

55:42.540 --> 55:43.641
Why, you're the one
that takes care

55:43.708 --> 55:45.142
of the entire universe!

55:45.209 --> 55:47.712
But you'd be surprised
how little thanks
I get for it.

55:47.778 --> 55:51.716
Most people don't even
know I exist.

55:51.782 --> 55:54.485
This is the single
most fantastic journey

55:54.552 --> 55:57.522
in the history
of the world!

56:01.592 --> 56:03.260
Keep your voice down,
son.

56:03.327 --> 56:07.364
If one of these
things wakes up,
we're in real trouble.

56:07.432 --> 56:10.000
They look absolutely
starved!

56:11.368 --> 56:12.570
[gasp]

56:21.612 --> 56:22.947
Hey, look, Mom!

56:23.013 --> 56:25.583
The cave of some
prehistoric peoples!

56:32.623 --> 56:34.559
Their tools seem to be...

56:34.625 --> 56:36.627
fashioned of
a primitive Styrofoam.

56:36.694 --> 56:38.696
We've got to be careful,
Buster.

56:38.763 --> 56:41.699
The slightest disturbance
to this ancient world

56:41.766 --> 56:44.368
could affect the entire
course of history.

56:44.435 --> 56:46.203
Yes.

56:46.270 --> 56:49.907
The entire course
of history.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.515
What are you doing?

57:01.586 --> 57:02.887
Just think!

57:02.953 --> 57:05.923
My name is now
the first word
ever written.

57:05.990 --> 57:09.326
This rock will be
the most sacred
mystery on earth!

57:09.393 --> 57:11.596
Buster,
snap out of it!

57:11.662 --> 57:13.531
When mankind
learns to read,

57:13.598 --> 57:15.199
I'll be worshipped!

57:16.634 --> 57:20.337
Nations will rise
and fall in my name!

57:20.404 --> 57:21.939
Life on earth

57:22.006 --> 57:25.142
will be nothing
but a footnote
to Buster!

57:26.210 --> 57:29.146
We've gotta get
out of here!

57:29.213 --> 57:30.548
Not to be disrespectful,

57:30.615 --> 57:33.718
but I feel
that perhaps we've
come here too early.

57:33.784 --> 57:35.986
The truth is,
you two shouldn't
be here at all.

57:36.053 --> 57:38.489
You're sending us
back into the world?!

57:38.556 --> 57:40.891
I'm afraid so.
But don't
get me wrong.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.893
It's been
a pleasure
talking to you.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.029
But there's work
to be done.

57:45.095 --> 57:48.032
So our crusade against
the world's injustice
is important!

57:48.098 --> 57:50.300
Just head through
the door marked
exit.

57:50.367 --> 57:53.671
It'll take you back
to where your car
is parked.

57:53.738 --> 57:54.905
Did you hear that,
Petunia?

57:54.972 --> 57:56.774
We're getting
a second chance!

57:56.841 --> 57:59.977
Hurray!

58:00.044 --> 58:03.047
Do you have any
final words for us
before we go?

58:03.113 --> 58:06.050
Well, if you wanna
make my job easier,

58:06.116 --> 58:08.452
remember, throw your gum
in the trash

58:08.519 --> 58:10.054
when you're done
chewing it.

58:10.120 --> 58:13.057
I spend a huge
amount of time
cleaning up gum.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.260
So long as we live,
we shall fight that wrong.

58:26.270 --> 58:27.471
Sorry, Mom.

58:27.538 --> 58:30.808
I sort of went mad
with power back there.

58:30.875 --> 58:33.978
Well, the most
important thing is
we made it.

58:34.044 --> 58:37.014
Mom! Buster!

58:37.081 --> 58:39.049
Joan! Buster!

58:41.652 --> 58:43.420
Dad! Petunia!

58:43.487 --> 58:45.923
Stanley! Petunia!

58:49.093 --> 58:51.428
You made it!

58:51.495 --> 58:52.830
Are you all right?

58:52.897 --> 58:54.565
How did it go
in there?

58:54.632 --> 58:56.433
Joan, we had
a remarkable 20 minutes.

58:56.500 --> 58:57.835
We died,
went to heaven,

58:57.902 --> 59:01.205
met God, and got
brought back to life.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.741
But still
no sign of Sender.

59:03.808 --> 59:05.843
What happened
to you guys?

59:05.910 --> 59:07.444
We traveled through time
to the age of dinosaurs,

59:07.511 --> 59:09.246
and Buster
established himself

59:09.313 --> 59:11.949
as the most important
and mysterious figure
in history.

59:12.016 --> 59:13.183
Buster?

59:13.250 --> 59:14.451
Sorry, Dad.

59:14.518 --> 59:16.987
And even more
importantly,

59:17.054 --> 59:18.989
we found this.

59:20.858 --> 59:24.962
Names, places,
dates, times...

59:25.029 --> 59:26.096
wait a minute.

59:26.163 --> 59:28.398
There's an entry
in here for today.

59:28.465 --> 59:30.267
"Channel Three news
at 1:00."

59:30.334 --> 59:32.803
We passed
the Channel Three news station

59:32.870 --> 59:33.838
on the way over here.

59:33.904 --> 59:35.505
It's almost
1:00 now.

59:35.572 --> 59:36.941
The trail
is still fresh!

59:37.007 --> 59:38.108
Let's go.

59:47.685 --> 59:50.621
[jazz music playing]

01:00:01.298 --> 01:00:02.266
[screeches]

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:05.836
We're here.

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:15.379
Somewhere
in this building

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:16.747
is the man
we're looking for.

01:00:16.814 --> 01:00:19.884
Let's find him
before he finds us.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.096
Good news today
for culture buffs.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:33.831
The new exhibit
arrives today

01:00:33.898 --> 01:00:35.332
at the Museum
of Natural History.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.267
Here to tell us
about the highlights

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:39.436
is Museum Director,
Charles Sender.

01:00:39.503 --> 01:00:41.038
Welcome.

01:00:41.105 --> 01:00:42.139
Thank you.

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:44.441
If you love
pre-Colombian sculpture

01:00:44.508 --> 01:00:46.010
as much as I do,

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:48.445
you are in for
a real surprise.

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:50.047
In less
than an hour,

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:54.251
I will be picking up
a stunning collection
of Olmec heads

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.554
on loan from museums
all over the world.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:59.356
I understand
it's exhibits like this

01:00:59.423 --> 01:01:02.459
have given our museum
its most profitable year ever.

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.995
You must be
a sought-after curator.

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:09.666
Yes. Sometimes
I feel like
a hunted man.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:15.039
Try your best
to blend in, Petunia.

01:01:15.105 --> 01:01:17.374
Remember, we can't
afford to get caught.

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.810
Excuse me,
I'm looking for
the Late At Night Show.

01:01:19.877 --> 01:01:22.747
Excuse me. I'm
looking for the set of
the Late At Night Show.

01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:24.181
I'm supposed to make
a delivery there.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:26.283
I'm supposed to make
a delivery there!

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.152
Could you give this
to Doug the stage hand?

01:01:28.218 --> 01:01:31.421
He's a big fat guy.
You can't miss him.

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:32.923
Here...

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.693
this will get you backstage.
I really appreciate this.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:42.967
I'm sorry.
They're taping a t.v. show.

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:46.170
No one gets in without
proper authorization.

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:48.205
Oh! Ma'am.
This way, please.

01:01:52.609 --> 01:01:55.445
Keep your eyes
peeled for anything
unusual, son.

01:01:55.512 --> 01:01:57.481
Mr. Sender
can't be far away.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:02:00.650
Just watch for
the slightest sign
of strange behavior.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.319
Dad?

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:05.589
They're putting make-up
on men in there.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.357
Bull's-eye.

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.399
Are they ready?

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.433
Ready when you are.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:18.735
Let's go, everyone.
We're on.

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:28.012
OK. Let's go.

01:02:30.881 --> 01:02:33.750
[woman] Yeah, but Sly's
a lot taller now.

01:02:33.818 --> 01:02:36.153
People think it's easy
being a celebrity,

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:39.223
but when they canceled
my series, Malibu Beach
Detective,

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.225
I was just
absolutely devastated.

01:02:47.998 --> 01:02:49.233
Well, I'm sure everyone

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.235
is very sympathetic
for you.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:54.238
You put so much work
into such a fine series

01:02:54.304 --> 01:02:56.240
to have it
taken off the air.

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:58.843
As an artist,
I was truly crushed.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:04.348
It was the most awful,
heartbreaking,

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:07.818
shocking thing
that's ever
happened to me!

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.997
Mom, I can't get
this light switch to work.

01:03:20.064 --> 01:03:21.966
Just a moment, dear.

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:29.439
OK. Now, let's take
a look.

01:03:37.848 --> 01:03:39.683
Well, maybe you'd
all be happier

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:42.519
if there was no
prime time television.

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:48.525
What's going on?

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.035
You could spend every night
reading books together.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:08.012
[applauding, cheering]

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:15.052
Well, my next guest
is a world-class French chef,

01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:18.055
so stay tuned everyone
and let's...

01:04:18.122 --> 01:04:19.856
give it to the fat guy!

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:23.427
Fat?

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:24.428
Moi, fat?

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:27.064
[yelling in French]

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:32.536
[yelling in French]

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:46.383
OK. Let's settle,
everybody.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:48.385
We're on in 5...

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:50.287
4... 3...

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:54.458
Have you ever
thought you came from
an unusual family?

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:56.860
Well, after you meet
my guests today

01:04:56.927 --> 01:05:00.430
you may want to adjust
your standards.

01:05:00.497 --> 01:05:01.932
I divorced my wife

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:04.734
in order to date
her daughter.

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.470
[moans]

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:09.873
I married
a Siamese twin

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.875
and had an affair
with her sister.

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:13.343
[gasps]

01:05:15.279 --> 01:05:17.514
I've been engaged
to three of my cousins.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:23.387
I...

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.790
well, to tell you
the truth...

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:28.925
I'm...

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:31.261
I'm my own grandpa.

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:33.530
You're your own
grandpa?

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:35.032
That's right.

01:05:35.099 --> 01:05:36.200
Well, for those of us

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:38.202
who've never heard
of such a thing,

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.369
maybe you could explain.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.005
Of course.
It's quite simple, really.

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:42.372
[* Tom Arnold:
"I'm My Own Grandpaw"]

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.408
* Many many years ago
when I was 23 *

01:05:44.474 --> 01:05:46.210
* I was married
to a widow *

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:48.145
* who was purty
as could be *

01:05:48.212 --> 01:05:50.280
* This widow had
a grown-up daughter *

01:05:50.347 --> 01:05:52.082
* who had hair of red *

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:54.018
* My father
fell in love with her *

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:55.352
* and soon
the two were wed *

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:57.587
* This made my dad
my son-in-law *

01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.156
* and changed
my very life *

01:05:59.223 --> 01:06:00.757
* for my daughter
was my mother *

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:03.227
* 'cause she was
my father's wife *

* To complicate
the matter *

01:06:04.928 --> 01:06:06.696
* even though
it brought me joy *

01:06:06.763 --> 01:06:10.434
* I soon became the father
of a bouncing baby boy *

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:14.038
* My little baby then became
a brother-in-law to Dad *

01:06:14.104 --> 01:06:15.905
* And so became my uncle *

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.874
* though it made me
very sad *

01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:19.409
* for if he was my uncle *

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.311
* then that also
made him brother *

01:06:21.378 --> 01:06:23.247
* to the widow's
grown-up daughter *

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.282
* who of course
was my stepmother.. *

01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:28.218
That was our banker
in Bern.

01:06:28.285 --> 01:06:30.254
Payments will be
transferred to our account

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.855
when we deliver
the hardware

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.657
in approximately
two hours.

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:36.860
Nothing left
to do but relax,
Lieutenant.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:40.397
No power on earth
can stop us now.

* I'm my own grandpa *

01:06:46.936 --> 01:06:48.272
It's impossible.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.973
We killed that man.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.275
[turns television off]

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:53.077
Well, for God's sake,
kill him again.

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:55.011
Our future
is in his hands.

01:06:55.079 --> 01:06:56.946
* My father's wife
then had a son *

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.882
* who kept them
on the run *

01:06:58.948 --> 01:07:00.450
* and he became
my grandchild *

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.219
* 'cause he was
my daughter's son *

* My wife is now
my mother's mother *

01:07:04.321 --> 01:07:06.223
* and it makes me blue *

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:07.957
* because although
she is my wife *

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.626
* she's my
grandmother, too *

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:11.828
* If my wife
is my grandmother *

01:07:11.895 --> 01:07:13.430
* then I am
her grandchild *

01:07:13.497 --> 01:07:15.299
* and every time
I think of it *

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.334
* it nearly
drives me wild *

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:20.937

01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:35.319
* but it really is so *

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:39.723
* Hey! I'm
my own grandpa **

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:40.790
Stay tuned, everybody.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:43.059
We'll be back
after this break.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:50.234
Thanks again
for coming to the
station, Mr. Sender.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.536
It was a pleasure,
I assure you.

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:54.070
Bye-bye.

01:07:55.639 --> 01:07:56.406
Sender!

01:07:57.941 --> 01:07:59.075
We meet at last.

01:07:59.143 --> 01:08:00.644
No time to chat,
I'm afraid.

01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:04.481
I'm taking over
the heads of a dozen
foreign countries.

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:10.154
My God!

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.888
His plans for
world domination

01:08:11.955 --> 01:08:13.157
are already
coming together.

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:17.227
[ominous musical fanfare]

01:08:17.294 --> 01:08:19.263
You know what's
strange, Dad?

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.997
I would have thought
a man as powerful
as sender

01:08:22.064 --> 01:08:23.800
would be surrounded
by bodyguards.

01:08:23.867 --> 01:08:26.336
You can't see them, Buster,
but they're here,

01:08:26.403 --> 01:08:28.337
ready to pounce
on anyone

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:30.240
who so much as utters
the words,

01:08:30.307 --> 01:08:32.276
"I'll get you yet,
Sender." Whoa!

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.243
Hey! Let go
of my dad!

01:08:42.986 --> 01:08:44.287
Buster!

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.023
What happened?

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.559
It's Sender's men!
They captured Dad!

01:08:51.261 --> 01:08:53.462
[high-pitched screams]

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.465
so where are
we going, fellas?

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:11.348
Fasten your seat belts.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:34.069
You're a clever man,
Mr. Stupid...

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:36.973
if that really is your name.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.542
Too clever
for your own good.

01:09:40.877 --> 01:09:44.548
You play the innocent
most convincingly.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:46.716
You thought
you'd fool me

01:09:46.783 --> 01:09:48.285
into thinking
you were dead

01:09:48.352 --> 01:09:50.053
and then you'd
catch me red-handed

01:09:50.118 --> 01:09:51.888
when I went
to make the sale.

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:54.791
A masterful
bit of strategy,

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:58.928
and you came
dangerously close
to pulling it off.

01:09:58.995 --> 01:10:00.930
We'd better
get going, sir.

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:03.900
We're due at
Warehouse 21 in
less than an hour.

01:10:03.967 --> 01:10:05.435
Warehouse 21?

01:10:05.502 --> 01:10:08.405
No use gathering
intelligence now,
my friend.

01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:12.342
Our little
chess game is over.

01:10:13.610 --> 01:10:15.779
I hope you won't find
the end game

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:18.248
too unpleasant.

01:10:18.315 --> 01:10:20.917
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's nothing I can do.

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.601
It's no use.

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.569
They won't let anyone on
to that Army base

01:10:39.636 --> 01:10:40.970
unless they're in
the Army.

01:10:41.037 --> 01:10:43.139
This is serious.
Dad's in danger.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:45.342
We've got to think
of something.

01:10:45.409 --> 01:10:47.944
What if we form
our own army?

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:51.014
To do that, we'd have
to form our own country!

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:52.749
We could call it
"Stupidia,"

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:54.818
a sovereign nation
with its own laws

01:10:54.884 --> 01:10:56.620
its own customs,
its own government.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.822
Mom, as mother
of this household

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:02.792
your leadership's
withstood the test
of time.

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:05.094
I'd like to nominate
you as president.

01:11:05.161 --> 01:11:06.396
To the polls,
everyone.

01:11:06.463 --> 01:11:08.332
Get this
over with, already.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:11.000
This guy's already
taken out three of our best.

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:12.001
Relax.

01:11:14.404 --> 01:11:16.640
His hands are tied.
He's unarmed.

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:20.477
We've got two guards
posted outside.

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:22.379
I've got a gun on him.

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:24.714
There's no way
he's leaving here alive.

01:11:24.781 --> 01:11:26.883
Isn't that right,
Mr. Stupid?

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.051
[spits]

01:11:29.853 --> 01:11:33.056
Remember, throw your gum
in the trash

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.591
when you're done
chewing it.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:38.261
I spend a huge
amount of my time
cleaning up gum.

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:40.497
In the name
of the Lloyd!

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:53.943
[grunts]

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.379
Oh, gee.

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:57.614
All right.
Get your hands up.

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:01.084
[screams]

01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:05.689
Thank you,
dear Lloyd!

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:08.892
The polls
are dead even,

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.360
give or take a vote.

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.433
If only we knew
who Dad was voting for.

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.602
Joan! Joan!

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.269
Congratulations, Mom.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.138
Thank you, everyone.

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:24.107
And as your president,

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.309
I appoint
Stanley Stupid

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.677
head of the Army!

01:12:29.646 --> 01:12:31.515
Your first duty is
to go to that army base

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:32.916
and rescue my husband.

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.451
And get our dad
while you're at it.

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:36.319
I'm afraid those two
will have to wait.

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:38.988
We've got to get
to Warehouse 21.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:43.359
Joan, give me
the keys.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.101
The car won't start.

01:12:52.168 --> 01:12:54.471
Dad, you and Mom...

01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:56.039
switch places.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:12.589
Mom, hand the keys
to Dad.

01:13:19.829 --> 01:13:21.631
[car starts]

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:22.899
Good work, everybody!

01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:47.423
This must be the place.

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:08.945
Well, what have we here?

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:22.992
Shh.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.728
Sorry.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.818
[men talking]

01:15:19.783 --> 01:15:21.317
Excuse me, everyone.

01:15:21.384 --> 01:15:23.687
May I have
your attention, please?

01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:30.960
Impossible.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.796
He's amazing.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.564
Before you unleash strife

01:15:34.631 --> 01:15:36.432
and warfare upon
this planet,

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.768
please look
into your hearts.

01:15:40.169 --> 01:15:41.170
No guns.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:44.307
[Stanley] Inside,
you're still human beings.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:48.211
You can change
your ways.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:51.080
You all could come back
from the dark side.

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:56.786
You. Send a squad
toward the eastern flank
of the warehouse.

01:15:56.853 --> 01:15:58.855
You. Organize a counter
to the left.

01:15:58.922 --> 01:16:00.857
Your men will back
the first two squads

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:03.492
while my men
rove on point.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:06.395
But he's only one man.

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:07.530
Trust me.

01:16:07.597 --> 01:16:10.934
You don't want
to underestimate him.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.969
So turn yourselves
in, everyone.

01:16:13.036 --> 01:16:16.472
My family and I
do not wish
to fight you.

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:18.441
But if you
do not give up,

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:20.777
you will leave us
no choice.

01:16:20.844 --> 01:16:21.845
Are they giving up?

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:24.013
No. As a matter of fact,

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.583
they seem to be
organizing some sort
of massive attack.

01:16:27.651 --> 01:16:30.253
I guess they want
to do things the hard way.

01:16:33.556 --> 01:16:35.692
They seem
pretty well armed, Dad.

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:37.526
Yes, Buster,
but so are we.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:39.295
They may have
knives and guns

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:40.496
and missiles
and bombs,

01:16:40.563 --> 01:16:42.398
but we're armed
with the fact

01:16:42.465 --> 01:16:44.467
that what we're
doing is right.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.369
Sometimes you have
to trust in that.

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:55.679
Let the final
showdown begin.

01:17:03.486 --> 01:17:05.088
Don't!

01:17:05.154 --> 01:17:07.356
[ricochet]

01:17:19.435 --> 01:17:21.370
Get him!

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:29.045
Whoa!

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.081
Run! Move!

01:17:36.119 --> 01:17:38.054
Left! Right!

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:39.055
Right!

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:46.262
- Left! Left!
- Right!

01:17:50.066 --> 01:17:52.235
Left!
No, no--
the other left!

01:17:58.775 --> 01:17:59.909
No, no!

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:13.757
Take your time, men.

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:15.424
He's unarmed.

01:18:15.491 --> 01:18:17.761
Or am I?

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:24.100
Ah-ha!

01:18:30.073 --> 01:18:31.107
Ah-ha!

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.051
[growling]

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:44.287
I'm stuck! I'm caught.
I'm trapped.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:45.588
Somebody help me!

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:46.856
I'm "cornered."

01:18:46.923 --> 01:18:48.858
Yes! That's the word
I'm looking for.

01:18:48.925 --> 01:18:49.893
I'm cornered!

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.727
I'll save you, Dad.

01:19:27.563 --> 01:19:29.265
Must...

01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:30.900
concentrate.

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:34.503
Focus, power of mind...

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.072
over matter.

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:44.313
Channel every ounce
of will power.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.315
It's working!

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.683
I've done it!

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:51.120
Behold the super human
strength of Buster!

01:19:51.187 --> 01:19:52.521
Huh?

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:56.960
Grrrah.

01:19:59.195 --> 01:20:00.129
Buster!

01:20:11.908 --> 01:20:14.143
Whoa... whoa...

01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:24.753
Buster...

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.923
Sorry, Dad.

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:27.924
[explosion]

01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.392
What the hell
was that?

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:32.295
Sounds like it came
from the warehouse
district.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:34.163
[siren wailing]

01:20:47.243 --> 01:20:48.544
Phew.

01:20:56.819 --> 01:20:59.555
Buster? Stanley?

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:01.290
Please be careful
out there.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:05.194
There's lots of little
fires burning
all over the place.

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:06.862
[explosion]

01:21:26.249 --> 01:21:30.219
This is the worse
fire extinguisher
I've ever seen.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:07.423
How lovely.

01:22:10.626 --> 01:22:11.860
[explosion]

01:22:11.927 --> 01:22:13.062
- Aah! Aah!
- Aah!

01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:14.397
Car 15, request back-up.

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:17.666
Send squad cars immediately
to Warehouse 21.

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:20.436
Car 15,
we are on our way.

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:21.937
Oh, great.

01:22:22.005 --> 01:22:24.307
Fine! Just great.

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:42.125
[gunfire]

01:22:50.233 --> 01:22:52.201
We've got to
get out of here.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:54.970
Not to worry.
The police are
on my side...

01:22:55.038 --> 01:22:57.173
as far as they know.

01:23:00.043 --> 01:23:01.977
How do I look?

01:23:02.045 --> 01:23:05.014
Quite convincing, sir,
but what about me?

01:23:05.081 --> 01:23:07.983
You, my friend...

01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:10.653
are on the wrong
side of the law.

01:23:10.719 --> 01:23:11.687
Sir?

01:23:14.057 --> 01:23:15.591
Get some cuffs
over here!

01:23:15.658 --> 01:23:17.126
I got
the ring leader.

01:23:24.067 --> 01:23:26.001
Shoot to kill, boys.

01:23:26.069 --> 01:23:28.471
Those are evil men
in there.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:37.080
You've got to let me
through, officer.

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:38.547
The cargo
I'm transporting

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:39.948
is extremely cultural.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.350
I'm sorry, sir.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:43.686
No one's getting
through here
at the moment.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:47.022
I guess I'll find
another route home.

01:23:47.090 --> 01:23:49.358
In the meantime,
could you pull
your vehicle

01:23:49.425 --> 01:23:51.627
over with the rest
of the cars?

01:23:51.694 --> 01:23:55.631
Oh, Stanley.
You were so
brave in there.

01:23:57.433 --> 01:24:00.103
Look! The police
are on our side again.

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:09.812
Yes. Our work here
is done.

01:24:09.878 --> 01:24:11.914
Before we go,
there's a certain
arch villain

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.549
I'd like to speak to.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:16.352
I have a feeling
he learned an important
lesson today.

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:23.492
Well, my friend,
it seems you lost.

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:25.561
I certainly am.

01:24:25.628 --> 01:24:29.198
Problem is, you took
the wrong road
right from the start.

01:24:29.265 --> 01:24:31.400
Can you help get me
back on the right path?

01:24:31.467 --> 01:24:34.270
Yes, I can.
But it won't be easy.

01:24:34.337 --> 01:24:37.873
You've got to turn
yourself around.

01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.842
You've got
to straighten out.

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.910
But as long
as you can remember

01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:43.846
to head toward
the light,

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.014
you'll never go wrong.

01:24:46.081 --> 01:24:48.551
Thanks. You've really
saved me.

01:24:48.617 --> 01:24:51.387
Until we meet again.

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:03.466
It's been
quite a day.

01:25:04.733 --> 01:25:08.271
I have to say
that I'm glad
it's finally over.

01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:14.877
I'm afraid
it's not over yet.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.246
You must think
you have some kind

01:25:17.313 --> 01:25:19.348
of guardian angel,
Stanley.

01:25:19.415 --> 01:25:22.351
You thought
you could take me on
and pay no price--

01:25:22.418 --> 01:25:23.819
destroy my future...

01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:28.257
and then slip
through my fingers
again and again.

01:25:28.324 --> 01:25:32.461
Well, not this time,
bucko!

01:25:32.528 --> 01:25:35.898
This time I'm gonna
take care of you myself.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:40.936
Where's your guardian
angel now?

01:25:41.003 --> 01:25:42.004
- [groans]
- [thud]

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.138
Betcha surprised
to see me!

01:25:43.206 --> 01:25:44.407
We certainly are.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.209
And very impressed,
I might add.

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:48.244
Let this be
a lesson to you.

01:25:48.311 --> 01:25:49.545
Nobody gets away
from me.

01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:52.114
I've been on
the job too long.

01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.649
Here's your bill.

01:25:59.021 --> 01:26:00.489
[thuds]

01:26:00.556 --> 01:26:03.726
I would have thought
guardian angels
worked for free.

01:26:03.792 --> 01:26:07.496
Oh, Joan. You're so
wonderfully naive.

01:26:09.665 --> 01:26:11.934
I assume you work
for the Lloyd?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.204
Me? No. My boss'
name is Floyd.

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:19.575
No, it's pronounced
Lloyd.

01:26:27.049 --> 01:26:28.651
Hey, neighbor.

01:26:28.717 --> 01:26:29.652
Hey, Stanley.

01:26:29.718 --> 01:26:31.186
Didn't see you around
much this weekend.

01:26:31.254 --> 01:26:32.321
Whatcha been doing?

01:26:32.388 --> 01:26:33.756
This and that--

01:26:33.822 --> 01:26:36.925
had breakfast,
read the paper,
saved the world.

01:26:36.992 --> 01:26:38.093
Is that right?

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.662
Today I thought
we'd have a barbeque.

01:26:39.728 --> 01:26:41.730
Stop by. There's plenty
for everyone.

01:26:41.797 --> 01:26:44.333
Thanks, Stanley,
but I left the water

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.435
running in my bathtub.

01:27:22.605 --> 01:27:25.541
[snoring]

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:31.380
[slurps]

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:44.727
[snarls]

01:27:44.793 --> 01:27:47.663
[both speaking
alien language]

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:50.366
This is gonna be
great, Dad!

01:27:50.433 --> 01:27:52.134
Say, how can I help?

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:53.702
You can flip
the burgers, son,

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:56.505
but I'd better handle
the lighter fluid.

01:27:56.572 --> 01:27:58.307
See? "Keep out of reach
of children."

01:27:58.374 --> 01:28:00.142
You've gotta
be careful.

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.944
[speaking alien language]

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.582
[barking]

01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:09.284
What is it, boy?

01:28:13.255 --> 01:28:14.757
What is it, kitty?

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:16.959
[whimpering]

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.602
[screaming]

01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:30.573
[barking]

01:28:32.074 --> 01:28:33.008
Are you hungry?

01:28:33.075 --> 01:28:34.009
You want a biscuit?

01:28:34.076 --> 01:28:35.010
[woof!]

01:28:35.077 --> 01:28:36.211
[woof!]

01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:38.614
[woofwoofwoof woof!!!]

01:28:38.681 --> 01:28:43.118
That poor dog doesn't know
what he wants sometimes.

01:28:43.185 --> 01:28:45.020
[alien screaming]

01:28:52.227 --> 01:28:53.496
[sigh]

01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:44.279
[* Tom Arnold:

01:29:44.346 --> 01:29:46.415
* Many many years ago
when I was 23 *

01:29:46.482 --> 01:29:48.283
* I was married
to a widow *

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:50.218
* who was purty
as could be *

01:29:50.285 --> 01:29:52.421
* This widow had
a grown-up daughter *

01:29:52.488 --> 01:29:53.856
* who had hair of red *

01:29:53.922 --> 01:29:55.658
* My father
fell in love with her *

01:29:55.724 --> 01:29:57.660
* and soon
the two were wed *

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.562
* This made my dad
my son-in-law *

01:29:59.628 --> 01:30:01.530
* and changed
my very life *

01:30:01.597 --> 01:30:03.231
* for my daughter
was my mother *

01:30:03.298 --> 01:30:04.867
* 'cause she was
my father's wife *

01:30:04.933 --> 01:30:06.835
* To complicate
the matter *

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:09.137
* even though
it brought me joy *

01:30:09.204 --> 01:30:12.240
* I soon became the father
of a bouncing baby boy *

01:30:12.307 --> 01:30:16.244
* My little baby then became
a brother-in-law to dad *

01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:17.846
* and so became my uncle *

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:19.982
* though it made me
very sad *

01:30:20.048 --> 01:30:22.785
* for if he was my uncle then
that also made him brother *

01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:27.422
* to the widow's grown-up
daughter who of course
was my stepmother *

01:30:27.490 --> 01:30:31.259
* I'm my own grandpa *

01:30:31.326 --> 01:30:34.396
* I'm my own grandpa *

01:30:34.463 --> 01:30:36.198
* it sounds funny I know *

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:38.333
* but it really is so *

01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.904
* Ho! I'm my own grandpa *

01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:43.806
* my father's wife
then had a son *

01:30:43.872 --> 01:30:45.574
* who kept them
on the run *

01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:47.242
* and he became
my grandchild *

01:30:47.309 --> 01:30:49.377
* 'cause he was
my daughter's son *

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:51.213
* my wife is now
my mother's mother *

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.081
* and it makes me blue *

01:30:53.148 --> 01:30:54.950
* because all though
she is my wife *

01:30:55.017 --> 01:30:56.985
* she's my
grandmother, too *

01:30:57.052 --> 01:30:58.887
* If my wife
is my grandmother *

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:00.856
* then I am
her grandchild *

01:31:00.923 --> 01:31:02.758
* And every time
I think of it *

01:31:02.825 --> 01:31:04.760
* It nearly
drives me wild *

01:31:04.827 --> 01:31:07.896
[woman] * This has got
to be the strangest
thing I ever saw *

01:31:07.963 --> 01:31:09.765
* As husband of
my grandmother *

01:31:09.832 --> 01:31:11.834
* I am my own grandpa *

01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:14.436

01:31:20.776 --> 01:31:22.611
