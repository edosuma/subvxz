00:24.392 --> 00:26.264
Hello?

00:30.093 --> 00:32.183
Someone there?

00:58.600 --> 01:02.822
If to do were as easy as to
know what were good to do,

01:02.865 --> 01:05.346
chapels would have
been churches.

01:05.390 --> 01:10.830
Poor men's cottages,
prince's palaces.

01:10.873 --> 01:15.138
I could easily teach at 20
that were good to be done

01:15.182 --> 01:20.883
rather than be one of the 20
to follow my own teachings.

01:20.927 --> 01:22.842
The brain may devise
laws for the blood,

01:22.885 --> 01:25.410
but hot tempered leaps...

01:31.764 --> 01:33.679
Leaps...

01:33.722 --> 01:36.377
Over the cold to...

01:38.553 --> 01:40.816
Come on, take a bow!

01:42.340 --> 01:44.298
I'm never going
to get that part.

01:44.342 --> 01:46.953
So you won't play Juliet,
she dies anyway!

01:46.996 --> 01:48.041
Zero sequel protection.

01:48.084 --> 01:50.348
It's Portia from
Merchant of Venice.

01:50.391 --> 01:53.525
Kendra that was great,
until the end.

01:53.568 --> 01:55.440
You wanna run it again?

01:55.483 --> 01:58.312
Sorry Jake, but Lady Portia
and I have to get a move on.

01:58.356 --> 02:00.053
Yeah, totally.

02:00.096 --> 02:03.274
But I'd love to
try again tomorrow.

02:03.317 --> 02:05.188
Yeah sure, you know I
live just down the street,

02:05.232 --> 02:06.668
so if you ever want to rehearse

02:06.712 --> 02:08.235
or need something, I'm around.

02:08.279 --> 02:10.019
Yeah okay, thanks.

02:11.325 --> 02:12.892
You know I live just
down the street,

02:12.935 --> 02:14.372
so anytime you need something!

02:14.415 --> 02:16.635
You led that kid on so hard!

02:16.678 --> 02:17.940
He's kinda cute.

02:17.984 --> 02:19.942
I knew it!

02:19.986 --> 02:23.424
Well, forget about dating
boys, we're 21 now!

02:23.468 --> 02:25.644
Dude, no way! How
did you get those?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.168
My little secret.

02:28.211 --> 02:29.604
Pick a hand.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.002
No friggin' way, what?

02:36.045 --> 02:39.179
The Hollywood Helps
Charity Bash.

02:39.222 --> 02:41.312
Why it's the event of
the year, Kendra darling.

02:41.355 --> 02:44.793
Not to be missed by two thespian
beauties such as ourselves.

02:44.837 --> 02:47.143
Plus we can make some
real industry connections.

02:47.187 --> 02:49.798
No more high school
plays after tonight.

02:49.842 --> 02:52.323
It's tonight?

02:52.366 --> 02:55.674
Kendra! People
died for these.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.677
You know I can't
sneak out on Thursdays.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.722
Okay, if you tell me
that you can't come

03:00.766 --> 03:03.072
because you're watching that
stupid show with your mom,

03:03.116 --> 03:04.552
I'm probably gonna lose it.

03:04.596 --> 03:06.728
I mean, what would I say?
We watch it every Thursday.

03:06.772 --> 03:08.121
Set the DVR, okay?

03:08.164 --> 03:10.515
This is the Hollywood
Helps Charity Bash.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.517
Linn's been all on me since
we got caught drinking.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.953
If I bail, she'll
know something's up.

03:13.996 --> 03:14.867
Kendra...

03:14.910 --> 03:18.871
Misch, I'm sorry, I'm stuck.

03:18.914 --> 03:23.354
No Cinderella fairy tale
night for me, unfortunately.

03:23.397 --> 03:24.572
Come on, Cinderella.

03:28.184 --> 03:30.143
If you see my mom, can
you tell her I'm here?

03:30.186 --> 03:31.927
I'm picking her up today.

03:31.971 --> 03:33.581
Her car is in the shop.

03:37.324 --> 03:40.588
I've opened my heart,
I've given you my love.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.548
Now...

03:43.591 --> 03:47.421
Now the right.

03:47.465 --> 03:50.990
Will you have me?

03:51.033 --> 03:53.427
You better say yes, sweetheart.

03:55.429 --> 03:58.214
Find out if Brad has
met the love of his life,

03:58.258 --> 03:59.651
or just another Hollywood phony.

03:59.694 --> 04:01.870
Tonight at eight.

04:01.914 --> 04:04.438
I wouldn't turn
him down, would you?

04:04.482 --> 04:07.136
I watch with my daughter,
Kendra. She loves it.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.182
That's nice.

04:09.225 --> 04:11.837
It's about the only
thing we can do together.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.665
Without trying to
kill each other.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.841
Teenager?

04:15.884 --> 04:17.582
Poor thing.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.366
You'll get through it.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.415
Ms. Peterson,
can I borrow you?

04:24.458 --> 04:26.634
You're doing just fine.
I'll be right back.

04:26.678 --> 04:28.419
Thank you.

04:31.378 --> 04:32.814
Hey, can you watch my stuff?

04:32.858 --> 04:33.902
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

04:33.946 --> 04:34.642
Sure.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.864
Sorry for interrupting,
but this is quite serious.

04:38.907 --> 04:40.474
Well it must be,
we don't get many

04:40.518 --> 04:43.477
dental surgeons
on the rehab floor.

04:43.521 --> 04:45.174
We should change that.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.010
Good to see you too, doctor.

04:55.054 --> 04:57.273
We could meet more
often if we didn't have to

04:57.317 --> 04:58.797
keep this so private.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.625
It'll just be a little longer.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.583
Kendra's gotta learn
about me at some point.

05:02.627 --> 05:03.976
I know.

05:04.019 --> 05:06.457
She will, just not quite yet.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.633
Okay.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.809
So we on for dinner tonight?

05:10.852 --> 05:13.986
I told you, Kendra and
I have a standing date.

05:14.029 --> 05:16.858
Kendra can let her mom
off the hook for one night.

05:16.902 --> 05:18.817
Besides, you said it yourself,

05:18.860 --> 05:22.081
she's been acting out lately,
she's lying all the time.

05:22.124 --> 05:24.083
I can recommend a
great psychologist.

05:24.126 --> 05:25.867
Ty, enough.

05:31.917 --> 05:34.441
Kendra, you
remember Dr. Warson?

05:34.485 --> 05:35.616
Yeah.

05:35.660 --> 05:39.272
Hey Kendra, you
can just call me Ty.

05:39.315 --> 05:41.361
You were supposed to
be here at 5, it's 5:10

05:41.404 --> 05:43.711
and I have to study
for my bio test tomorrow.

05:43.755 --> 05:47.236
I thought you said your biology
test was next Wednesday?

05:48.455 --> 05:50.283
So, can we go?

05:50.326 --> 05:53.591
Sure, sweetie. Sorry
for keeping you waiting.

05:55.027 --> 05:56.637
So how was school?
How was your audition?

05:56.681 --> 05:58.204
Great.

06:02.556 --> 06:04.906
Do I believe in
love at first sight?

06:04.950 --> 06:06.647
Hell yeah, I do.

06:06.691 --> 06:10.912
You meet that special
person and bam!

06:10.956 --> 06:15.308
It just hits you and
you know she's the one.

06:15.351 --> 06:18.224
Apply now to be a
surprise guest on this season

06:18.267 --> 06:21.053
of Finding Love with the
world's most eligible bachelor,

06:21.096 --> 06:23.229
Brad Banton.

06:23.272 --> 06:26.275
Up next, Brad and Sarah
have their first date...

06:26.319 --> 06:27.799
Who're you calling?

06:27.842 --> 06:30.628
The show. Better get your
application in right away.

06:30.671 --> 06:32.934
Don't you dare! Wait!

06:32.978 --> 06:35.023
No, don't you dare!

06:35.067 --> 06:36.198
Hello?

06:36.242 --> 06:37.025
Hello?

06:37.069 --> 06:38.113
Yes, hi.

06:38.157 --> 06:39.332
Hi, this is Linn Peterson.

06:39.375 --> 06:43.205
I need a date with
Brad Banton ASAP.

06:43.249 --> 06:44.729
What, you don't want
to be in the running

06:44.772 --> 06:46.469
to become Mrs. Brad Banton?

06:46.513 --> 06:48.036
No, I do not.

06:48.080 --> 06:51.344
I am perfectly happy
right where I am.

06:51.387 --> 06:53.215
You miss dad?

06:54.652 --> 06:57.002
Sometimes.

06:57.045 --> 07:00.875
Do you still love him?

07:00.919 --> 07:03.225
Of course I do, honey.

07:03.269 --> 07:04.487
I always will.

07:04.531 --> 07:06.446
Then why're you
trying to replace him?

07:06.489 --> 07:08.230
What're you talking about?

07:08.274 --> 07:15.020
Come on, Dr. Warson?
Or should I call him Ty?

07:15.063 --> 07:18.197
Okay, you're right.

07:18.240 --> 07:20.852
I have been seeing him
for a couple of months now.

07:20.895 --> 07:23.158
But he is a good man, if
you just gave him a chance...

07:23.202 --> 07:26.118
Remember when he came
and met us at the cafeteria?

07:26.161 --> 07:28.599
Yeah.

07:28.642 --> 07:31.645
Did you not see the way
that he was looking at me?

07:34.517 --> 07:36.868
He's a serious pervert.

07:36.911 --> 07:38.870
Kendra, I was there.

07:38.913 --> 07:41.655
I saw him, he was
not coming onto you.

07:41.699 --> 07:43.614
I could be in serious danger
and you don't even care!

07:43.657 --> 07:45.398
Stop making up these
ridiculous stories.

07:45.441 --> 07:47.443
I am getting
really sick of this!

07:47.487 --> 07:49.445
You just want to get rid
of your little trouble child

07:49.489 --> 07:52.013
so that you can make a new
family and then be happy again!

07:52.057 --> 07:53.667
What? That is not true!

07:53.711 --> 07:56.104
Kendra, can't we
talk about this?

07:56.148 --> 07:57.540
No!

08:32.619 --> 08:34.360
Thank you.

08:34.403 --> 08:38.102
Okay, play it cool.

08:38.145 --> 08:40.061
They barely even
checked the IDs.

08:40.105 --> 08:42.542
Yeah that's because we're
supposed to be here, remember?

08:42.585 --> 08:45.327
Just relax!

08:45.371 --> 08:46.981
I'm relaxed.

08:47.025 --> 08:48.417
Over here!

08:51.899 --> 08:54.423
Two martinis, please!
Extra dirty.

08:56.164 --> 08:57.731
I cannot believe
we're here right now.

08:57.775 --> 08:58.819
Believe it, kid.

08:58.863 --> 09:00.516
Thank you.

09:01.779 --> 09:03.563
Cinderella.

09:03.606 --> 09:05.043
Bottoms up!

09:06.827 --> 09:08.786
Oh my god, what is that?

09:13.181 --> 09:15.531
Oh that's good.

09:15.575 --> 09:17.185
Yeah.

09:17.229 --> 09:19.361
Okay, time to get famous.

09:19.405 --> 09:20.798
Agents are the ones with ties

09:20.841 --> 09:22.408
and producers
are the flirty guys

09:22.451 --> 09:24.932
pretending they
don't want to talk.

09:24.976 --> 09:26.978
Meet back here in 30?

09:27.021 --> 09:29.197
What am I supposed to...

09:33.593 --> 09:34.768
Hi, I'm Kendra.

09:45.257 --> 09:48.216
Kendra honey, you still up?

09:51.567 --> 09:56.181
Hi, can I get a selzer water
with a tiny splash of vodka?

10:01.839 --> 10:04.232
Looks like she found her agent.

10:04.276 --> 10:05.973
He's an assistant.

10:06.017 --> 10:07.105
What?

10:09.411 --> 10:11.109
Did you see his shoes?

10:11.152 --> 10:13.633
And look at that suit!
It's a rental.

10:13.676 --> 10:16.201
He's in the mail room at best.

10:16.244 --> 10:18.769
You're...

10:18.812 --> 10:20.509
Oh my god.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.773
Wow I'm so embarrassed
right now.

10:22.816 --> 10:24.775
Don't be, these idiots
they never pay attention

10:24.818 --> 10:26.124
to where they're going.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.603
Yeah, who did that?

10:27.647 --> 10:29.170
Are you okay?

10:29.214 --> 10:31.129
Yeah, it's just my
ego that's bruised.

10:31.172 --> 10:35.960
Well if it helps at all,
I feel really proud right now.

10:36.003 --> 10:38.484
I'm glad I could help with that.

10:38.527 --> 10:42.967
It's not every day I get to
save a beautiful girl's life.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.927
I think you're in my debt now.

10:46.971 --> 10:48.842
Oh, is that right?

10:48.886 --> 10:50.888
According to Chinese custom.

10:50.931 --> 10:52.759
I don't know how it works
here in Hollywood, but...

10:52.803 --> 10:55.283
Brad, are you going to
leave me waiting all night?

10:55.327 --> 10:58.460
Sorry, this is...

10:58.504 --> 10:59.592
It's Kendra.

10:59.635 --> 11:00.723
Kendra.

11:00.767 --> 11:01.855
I don't mean to brag,

11:01.899 --> 11:04.510
but I just about
saved Kendra's life.

11:04.553 --> 11:07.426
Well, next time you're planning
to play hero to some fan girl,

11:07.469 --> 11:10.559
let me know and I'll have
TMZ catch it on video.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.692
Now there's some people
who want to meet you.

11:12.735 --> 11:14.912
We're discussing a new
show for upfronts.

11:14.955 --> 11:16.827
Okay. See you around?

11:16.870 --> 11:17.784
Yup, okay.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.903
Hey.

11:51.862 --> 11:54.299
You okay?

11:54.342 --> 11:57.476
Recovering just fine, thank you.

11:57.519 --> 12:00.609
You just seem a little lonely.

12:01.741 --> 12:04.613
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.659
You know, like you and me.

12:06.702 --> 12:10.793
We'll go for a
walk or something.

12:10.837 --> 12:13.231
Yes.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.275
You can do that?

12:14.319 --> 12:15.276
I can do that.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.061
Great.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.150
That woman, she was your agent?

12:19.193 --> 12:20.629
No, she's my manager.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.370
I'm sorry she can
be pretty ruthless,

12:22.414 --> 12:23.937
but I always try
to remind myself

12:23.981 --> 12:27.636
that she has my
best interests at heart.

12:27.680 --> 12:29.943
Are you sure it's okay?

12:29.987 --> 12:32.206
You're not missing anything,
I promise, trust me.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.949
Yeah, I know I'm
not missing anything.

12:35.993 --> 12:40.998
But I mean you,
you're Brad Banton.

12:41.041 --> 12:47.134
The millionaire superstar, the
most eligible man in the galaxy.

12:47.178 --> 12:49.180
Wait, whoa!

12:49.223 --> 12:50.137
You all right?

12:50.181 --> 12:51.138
Yeah.

12:51.182 --> 12:52.618
Not again.

12:54.402 --> 12:59.712
Honestly, I wish I
was doing anything else.

12:59.755 --> 13:02.367
I wanted to be an actor,
a real actor.

13:02.410 --> 13:05.979
Not whatever this is.

13:06.023 --> 13:09.069
I always thought you were great.

13:09.113 --> 13:11.071
I saw your old show.

13:11.115 --> 13:12.986
Oh, well thank you.

13:13.030 --> 13:14.857
It got canceled
was 15 years old,

13:14.901 --> 13:17.295
but I'm crawling my
way back to the top.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.906
As a reality star!

13:22.343 --> 13:24.998
Trust me, I'd much rather
be doing Shakespeare.

13:25.042 --> 13:27.435
I'm actually auditioning for the
Merchant of Venice this week.

13:27.479 --> 13:30.047
No way, wow! What theater?

13:33.441 --> 13:36.314
Katz, it's a group theater.

13:36.357 --> 13:39.491
It's really small.

13:39.534 --> 13:42.015
I remember doing that
play in drama class.

13:42.059 --> 13:43.886
Mr. Singleton.

13:43.930 --> 13:46.715
From Glendon Highschool?

13:46.759 --> 13:49.153
You went to Glendon!
What year?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.502
2010.

13:50.545 --> 13:51.633
We just missed each other!

13:51.677 --> 13:53.244
I pulled out in
'04 to do the show.

13:53.287 --> 13:55.202
That's so cool!

13:55.246 --> 13:57.335
No, it's not really that cool.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.902
No prom, no graduation.

13:59.946 --> 14:05.604
My dad left when I was young
and that mixed with the work...

14:05.647 --> 14:08.999
It was lonely sometimes.

14:09.042 --> 14:10.522
I'm sorry, I don't
usually babble like this.

14:10.565 --> 14:12.524
No.

14:14.874 --> 14:17.529
My dad died when I
was in the seventh grade.

14:17.572 --> 14:18.660
I'm sorry.

14:18.704 --> 14:20.314
It's okay.

14:20.358 --> 14:24.971
Everyone used to
say that he died fighting

14:25.015 --> 14:27.234
for our freedom, he was a hero.

14:31.108 --> 14:34.546
He was just dad to me.

14:34.589 --> 14:37.418
Well, I'm sure he'd be
very proud of you.

14:40.117 --> 14:42.380
It's probably pretty late,
I should call an Uber.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.079
No please, I can drive you home.

14:46.123 --> 14:48.299
Yeah, okay.

14:48.342 --> 14:50.736
I'm parked right up here.

14:59.136 --> 14:59.919
I'll walk you in.

14:59.962 --> 15:02.443
No!

15:02.487 --> 15:05.446
I mean you've just
been so nice already.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.447
Okay.

15:08.362 --> 15:10.799
Wait, wait, wait!

15:10.843 --> 15:13.106
Can I see you again?

15:13.150 --> 15:16.501
Sometime, maybe?

15:16.544 --> 15:19.156
I mean I don't mean
to sound pushy, but...

15:19.199 --> 15:21.984
I did kinda save your life,
if you remember.

15:22.028 --> 15:24.422
Yeah, yes.

15:25.727 --> 15:29.340
Absolutely. Call me?

15:29.383 --> 15:31.864
Yeah.

15:42.831 --> 15:46.226
Until next time, beautiful.

16:07.073 --> 16:08.553
Sit.

16:11.033 --> 16:12.948
Where the hell have you been?

16:12.992 --> 16:15.864
I was practicing for
the audition with Mischa.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.127
Do you think I'm an idiot?

16:17.170 --> 16:19.303
It's a costume,
it's for the play.

16:21.609 --> 16:25.178
Where's your other shoe, huh?
Did you lose it?

16:25.222 --> 16:27.528
Is that alcohol I
smell your breath?

16:27.572 --> 16:29.139
I barely drank anything!

16:29.182 --> 16:32.968
What do you mean barely
anything, where did you go?

16:33.012 --> 16:34.492
Like you care.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.929
You think I don't care?

16:36.972 --> 16:39.497
Do you think it was easy
having a kid so young?

16:39.540 --> 16:43.457
Watching your dad leave?

16:43.501 --> 16:46.721
And then finding out
he's never coming back?

16:46.765 --> 16:48.114
Putting myself through school,

16:48.158 --> 16:51.161
raising you,
working all on my own.

16:51.204 --> 16:54.990
You think I do all
that because I don't care?

16:55.034 --> 16:58.777
Don't you know I only
want what's best for you?

17:00.518 --> 17:03.216
You are grounded indefinitely.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.044
You go to school,
you go to rehearsal,

17:05.087 --> 17:07.742
you come home, that is it!

17:08.656 --> 17:11.050
Whatever.

17:15.358 --> 17:18.188
Brad Banton? You know
how many followers he has?

17:18.231 --> 17:20.493
A lot, I'm sure.

17:20.538 --> 17:23.367
You're right, think bigger.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.195
Where do you think
he's going to take you?

17:26.239 --> 17:28.241
Nowhere, remember I'm grounded?

17:28.285 --> 17:30.025
Come on!

17:30.069 --> 17:34.029
She was serious this
time, Linn, she meant it.

17:34.073 --> 17:36.075
Kendra, this is Brad Banton.

17:36.118 --> 17:39.078
The most eligible
bachelor in the world!

17:39.121 --> 17:41.602
I mean doesn't your mom
have to work Saturdays?

17:41.646 --> 17:44.214
Yeah until 1 AM, but...

17:44.257 --> 17:46.259
What?

17:46.303 --> 17:48.218
Is that him?

17:48.261 --> 17:49.915
Oh my god!

17:49.958 --> 17:53.701
I gotta go! I gotta
fix my face and...

18:13.591 --> 18:16.202
Hey you!

18:16.246 --> 18:17.725
Hey.

18:17.769 --> 18:20.162
Cotton candy?

18:20.206 --> 18:21.642
They're selling
right down the street.

18:21.686 --> 18:24.950
Couldn't resist.

18:24.993 --> 18:26.299
It's bubble gum flavor,
that's my favorite!

18:26.343 --> 18:27.692
Oh!

18:27.735 --> 18:29.737
What?

18:29.781 --> 18:31.783
You passed!

18:31.826 --> 18:33.611
It's my favorite, too.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.003
We couldn't have
a future together

18:35.047 --> 18:37.049
if you didn't love
bubble gum cotton candy.

18:37.092 --> 18:39.486
Who'd want a future without
bubble flavored cotton candy?

18:39.530 --> 18:41.183
See, that's what
I like about you.

18:41.227 --> 18:42.533
My love for all things sugary?

18:42.576 --> 18:46.406
No! You're like... real.

18:47.973 --> 18:49.714
I mean I hope so.

18:49.757 --> 18:51.106
No, I'm serious.

18:51.150 --> 18:52.804
The girls in this town,
especially in this town,

18:52.847 --> 18:56.155
they're all so fake.

18:56.198 --> 19:00.638
But not you,
you're... different.

19:04.294 --> 19:07.558
What's wrong?

19:07.601 --> 19:10.343
My roommate is
gonna be home soon

19:10.387 --> 19:11.997
and I don't wanna cause a scene.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.434
I wasn't planning
on staying long.

19:14.478 --> 19:20.571
I just wanted to stop
by and ask you out.

19:20.614 --> 19:25.880
Like, on a date.
Are you free this week?

19:25.924 --> 19:28.361
Saturday night should work.

19:28.405 --> 19:30.363
Perfect!

19:32.713 --> 19:34.498
I'll see you then.

19:36.761 --> 19:38.589
Don't ruin your dinner.

19:45.422 --> 19:46.988
Linn, can I have a minute?

19:47.032 --> 19:48.207
Sure.

19:54.300 --> 19:57.738
Is something wrong?

19:59.958 --> 20:03.831
I've been thinking...

20:03.875 --> 20:05.877
And I don't think
it's the best thing

20:05.920 --> 20:09.489
for us to see
each other anymore.

20:12.362 --> 20:15.234
If this is about Kendra,
I apologize.

20:15.277 --> 20:16.975
And I have talked to her
seriously

20:17.018 --> 20:18.542
about the lying, and acting out.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.413
It's not Kendra.

20:20.457 --> 20:24.417
At least, it's
it's not just her.

20:24.461 --> 20:28.334
I think you're really
great, Linn, I really do.

20:28.378 --> 20:31.032
But you're just not
ready for this either.

20:31.076 --> 20:34.427
I was hoping
maybe you were, but I...

20:34.471 --> 20:38.257
It's just not gonna to work.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.433
I'm sorry.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.310
Thank you.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.884
Where is everybody?

20:56.928 --> 20:58.582
Did it just open or something?

20:58.625 --> 21:00.584
I thought we would
enjoy the privacy.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.628
Wait, did you...

21:01.672 --> 21:03.978
Book the whole restaurant?

21:05.893 --> 21:08.461
The '98 Cabernet you
requested will be right out.

21:08.505 --> 21:11.769
Anything else, Mr. Banton?

21:11.812 --> 21:15.468
<i>Vorremmo ordinare la melanzana.</i>

21:15.512 --> 21:16.643
<i>Si signore.</i>

21:16.687 --> 21:19.167
<i>Grazie.</i>

21:19.211 --> 21:20.517
It's eggplant.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.605
Eggplant?

21:21.648 --> 21:23.563
You'll love it, I promise.

21:36.358 --> 21:40.145
Hi you've reached Kendra
Peterson, leave a message.

21:40.188 --> 21:43.191
Hi Kendra, it's mom.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.802
Just wanted to check on you.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.543
Hope you're okay.

21:49.459 --> 21:55.508
I love you more than you know.

21:55.552 --> 21:59.164
Call me when
you can. Bye hon.

22:01.035 --> 22:05.866
You're everything I ever wanted,
my dream girl, my everything.

22:05.910 --> 22:08.086
Kendra Peterson,
will you make me

22:08.129 --> 22:11.524
the happiest man in the world?

22:11.568 --> 22:14.962
Will you you marry me?

22:15.006 --> 22:16.964
That is so lame.

22:17.008 --> 22:19.401
I'm sorry, I love
the ring though.

22:19.445 --> 22:22.404
But you hate it!

22:22.448 --> 22:24.755
It's not your best work.

22:24.798 --> 22:27.148
I know! These producers,

22:27.192 --> 22:29.760
they always want
you to sparkle it up.

22:29.803 --> 22:31.544
You know, the
sappier the better.

22:31.588 --> 22:35.026
No no, we love the sappy,
don't get me wrong.

22:35.069 --> 22:37.028
Thank you.

22:37.071 --> 22:40.466
But I mean, you're
all I could ever want?

22:40.510 --> 22:42.816
Make me the happiest
man in the world?

22:42.860 --> 22:44.557
I mean it's a little
chauvinist, right?

22:44.601 --> 22:45.950
Yeah.

22:45.993 --> 22:47.691
Why can't you say marry
me and I'll make you

22:47.734 --> 22:50.563
the happiest woman in the world?

22:50.607 --> 22:52.913
Cheers!

22:52.957 --> 22:54.393
Wait.

22:56.787 --> 22:59.311
What? Oh, it's fine.

22:59.354 --> 23:02.140
No no no, take mine.

23:02.183 --> 23:03.794
I'll be right back.

23:09.234 --> 23:11.236
What is this?

23:11.279 --> 23:12.759
I'm sorry, sir.

23:12.803 --> 23:14.195
That's strike one!
Don't let it happen again!

23:14.239 --> 23:16.458
Yes sir.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.115
I am very very sorry, madam.

23:21.159 --> 23:23.901
Seriously, it's fine.

23:29.776 --> 23:31.909
How do you feel
about lamb chops?

23:31.952 --> 23:34.564
They're unbelievable here.

23:48.665 --> 23:50.667
No, you did not
see that episode!

23:50.710 --> 23:52.016
Thank you.

23:53.278 --> 23:55.062
I couldn't stop watching it.

23:55.106 --> 23:56.673
I didn't know how to ride!

23:56.716 --> 23:58.109
The producer said it
would be more dramatic

23:58.152 --> 23:59.850
if I showed up on horseback.

23:59.893 --> 24:02.330
Yeah, I don't think they knew
you were gonna fall on your ass.

24:02.374 --> 24:05.812
And splash mud
all over the girls!

24:05.856 --> 24:09.076
They were all phonies, anyway.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.035
Who, the girls?

24:11.078 --> 24:14.604
Yeah, all the girls
in this town are fakes.

24:14.647 --> 24:19.957
Well, not all...

24:20.000 --> 24:23.090
When you're in this business
you're surrounded by people

24:23.134 --> 24:25.571
who are just calling
themselves your friend.

24:25.615 --> 24:28.443
They're not, they're using you.

24:28.487 --> 24:32.491
Trying to extract some
kind of value from you

24:32.534 --> 24:35.581
and sometimes the
real feelings get

24:35.625 --> 24:38.323
mixed up with the fake stuff and

24:38.366 --> 24:42.980
when you find out the person
you love is using you...

24:43.023 --> 24:45.373
You get hurt.

24:46.766 --> 24:49.551
There was one
person that was real.

24:49.595 --> 24:51.031
Once.

24:53.381 --> 24:56.515
She... she passed away.

24:59.257 --> 25:02.695
It was a car accident.

25:02.739 --> 25:04.218
It was Allison, right?

25:04.262 --> 25:06.873
It was all over the news.

25:06.917 --> 25:10.355
You know what the worst part
was about that whole thing?

25:10.398 --> 25:13.663
After it happened, the only
thing all those friends

25:13.706 --> 25:15.708
cared about, the agents,
managers, producers,

25:15.752 --> 25:17.318
the only thing that
they cared about

25:17.362 --> 25:19.625
was using her death
to bump the viewership

25:19.669 --> 25:21.714
of the show like she was some...

25:21.758 --> 25:23.716
marketing gimmick!

25:23.760 --> 25:25.718
That's horrible.

25:30.505 --> 25:31.550
Davio?

25:31.593 --> 25:33.073
Yes?

25:35.336 --> 25:36.816
What the hell is this is?

25:36.860 --> 25:37.730
Excuse me, sir?

25:37.774 --> 25:38.600
This is medium rare?

25:38.644 --> 25:39.732
Seriously, it's fine!

25:39.776 --> 25:41.342
No, it's not fine!

25:41.386 --> 25:44.389
Take a look at this! Are you
trying to ruin our night?

25:44.432 --> 25:47.609
No sir, I'll take it back.

25:47.653 --> 25:49.786
No, eat it!

25:55.443 --> 25:56.575
I'm gonna go.

25:56.618 --> 25:59.056
Kendra...

25:59.099 --> 26:02.146
I'm sorry.

26:02.189 --> 26:04.496
When we talk about this
stuff, I get so worked up.

26:04.539 --> 26:05.932
I wanted this
night to be perfect.

26:05.976 --> 26:07.368
I didn't mean to like...

26:07.412 --> 26:09.196
To go completely crazy?

26:09.240 --> 26:11.416
Yeah, I think me being on
this stupid show for so long

26:11.459 --> 26:13.679
has given me an
unrealistic expectation

26:13.723 --> 26:16.464
of what a first date
is supposed to be like.

26:16.508 --> 26:20.120
Yeah, you could say that again.

26:20.164 --> 26:21.643
I think me being
on this stupid show

26:21.687 --> 26:23.167
for so long gave
me an unrealistic...

26:23.210 --> 26:24.995
Stop, stop it!

26:25.038 --> 26:27.737
You know what I meant.

26:27.780 --> 26:30.435
I'm sorry.

26:30.478 --> 26:34.395
Let me make it up to you.

26:34.439 --> 26:36.702
I have a surprise for you.

26:36.746 --> 26:40.184
And if you don't like it, I
will take you straight home.

26:43.709 --> 26:45.537
Okay.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.804
Wow, this place is huge.

26:51.848 --> 26:54.415
Yeah, well if you
wanna be a huge act,

26:54.459 --> 26:56.200
you need a huge stage, right?

26:56.243 --> 26:57.767
I guess.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.594
Let me go get your surprise.

26:59.638 --> 27:01.379
Is that pinball?

27:01.422 --> 27:03.033
You play?

27:03.076 --> 27:05.775
Yeah, I play to win.

27:05.818 --> 27:08.386
Sounds like a challenge.

27:08.429 --> 27:09.779
Smile.

27:13.826 --> 27:14.871
Wow that's retro.

27:14.914 --> 27:16.786
Oh yeah!

27:19.310 --> 27:21.878
I always preferred a
picture as a picture.

27:21.921 --> 27:24.010
Not just a post.

27:26.404 --> 27:30.277
Besides now there's something
to remember our first date by.

27:30.321 --> 27:33.672
When we're old and grey.

27:33.715 --> 27:35.979
That's cute.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.720
It is cute.

27:41.898 --> 27:43.856
It's probably late,
I should get going.

27:43.900 --> 27:46.990
It's barely midnight.

27:47.033 --> 27:51.733
Wow time flies, I gotta home.

27:51.777 --> 27:53.431
I haven't even given
you the surprise yet.

27:53.474 --> 27:56.173
Just sit down,
I'll be right back.

28:09.012 --> 28:11.275
You must be pretty
close with your manager.

28:11.318 --> 28:13.581
How long has she
been working with you?

28:14.844 --> 28:16.584
Ta-da!

28:16.628 --> 28:17.803
My shoe!

28:17.847 --> 28:19.196
We better make
sure it still fits.

28:19.239 --> 28:21.981
I am sure it still fits.
Thank you!

28:22.025 --> 28:24.201
You're welcome.

28:24.244 --> 28:28.858
Kind of feel like your
Prince Charming right now.

28:28.901 --> 28:31.295
I should go home, midnight
is kind of my cutoff.

28:31.338 --> 28:34.167
Oh yeah? Just
like Cinderella?

28:34.211 --> 28:36.039
Yeah you know, I
gotta get out of here

28:36.082 --> 28:38.476
before my coach
turns into a pumpkin.

28:41.783 --> 28:43.960
Whoa, wow.

28:46.223 --> 28:48.834
Sorry.

28:48.878 --> 28:50.967
Couldn't help myself.

28:52.664 --> 28:56.450
Okay, it's going a little
too fast and I gotta get home.

28:56.494 --> 28:58.322
Kendra, listen to me.

28:58.365 --> 29:03.370
There's a reason why I
needed tonight to be perfect.

29:03.414 --> 29:06.373
Because I've been
thinking about you.

29:06.417 --> 29:09.072
I can't stop thinking about you.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.813
Every hour...

29:11.857 --> 29:14.033
Okay, wait.

29:14.077 --> 29:14.947
Stop.

29:14.991 --> 29:15.730
No, I can't stop.

29:15.774 --> 29:18.211
No, stop!

29:18.255 --> 29:20.692
I'm only 17!

29:22.999 --> 29:24.478
What?

29:24.522 --> 29:26.480
Yeah I lied, okay?

29:26.524 --> 29:29.875
Because I thought this
was something it isn't.

29:40.712 --> 29:42.322
It's okay.

29:45.543 --> 29:47.893
Next year you'll be legal,
we can be together.

29:47.937 --> 29:50.156
Just have to keep it private
until then, come here.

29:50.200 --> 29:53.203
No, no, no!

29:53.246 --> 29:54.987
Bradley!

29:56.293 --> 29:58.034
What're you doing here?

29:58.077 --> 30:01.689
Come girl, it's time to go home.

30:04.649 --> 30:06.738
Kendra...

30:20.056 --> 30:23.581
I know a million girls like you.

30:23.624 --> 30:26.323
You can't screw
your way to stardom.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.673
It takes years to
learn how to talk.

30:28.716 --> 30:31.415
How to act.

30:31.458 --> 30:34.679
Maybe your client should
learn how to treat women.

30:34.722 --> 30:38.161
Pervert.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.946
Stay away from him.

30:45.951 --> 30:48.258
No problem.

30:58.268 --> 30:59.399
First new message.

30:59.443 --> 31:02.098
Hi Kendra, it's Mom.

31:02.141 --> 31:03.751
Just wanted to check on you.

31:03.795 --> 31:06.232
I hope you're okay.

31:08.321 --> 31:12.064
I love you more than you know.

31:14.284 --> 31:17.243
Call me when you can. Bye hon.

31:19.202 --> 31:20.986
End of messages.

31:27.688 --> 31:29.690
In a year you're gonna be legal,

31:29.734 --> 31:31.953
then we can be together.

31:31.997 --> 31:33.912
We just have to keep it
private until then, that's all.

31:33.955 --> 31:37.089
No! No!

31:37.133 --> 31:38.438
Kendra, hey!

31:38.482 --> 31:40.875
Sorry, the bell rang.

31:40.919 --> 31:42.877
I didn't hear it.

31:42.921 --> 31:47.447
Okay, well the Portia auditions
are up first, so you ready?

31:48.622 --> 31:49.406
Oh my god!

31:49.449 --> 31:50.363
Come on!

31:54.063 --> 31:57.501
The brain may devise laws for
the blood, but a hot temper...

31:57.544 --> 32:01.896
Thy paleness moves me
more than eloquence;

32:01.940 --> 32:04.986
And her choose I.

32:05.030 --> 32:09.295
Joy being the consequence!

32:12.994 --> 32:15.171
Just as I remember,
Mr. Banton.

32:15.214 --> 32:17.651
Are you sure you won't
join us for the fall play?

32:17.695 --> 32:19.131
I'd love to,

32:19.175 --> 32:22.047
but I just don't think
you can afford me anymore!

32:22.091 --> 32:24.832
We'd gladly settle
for more guest visits.

32:24.876 --> 32:26.399
Thank you.

32:26.443 --> 32:28.967
Now class, we'll get
to auditions in a moment,

32:29.010 --> 32:32.840
but first... Mr. Banton studied
Shakespeare right here

32:32.884 --> 32:35.713
at Glendon and he's gone
on to some considerable

32:35.756 --> 32:38.455
Hollywood success,
as I'm sure you all know.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.196
Does anyone have any questions?

32:40.239 --> 32:41.632
I do!

32:53.383 --> 32:55.341
You missed your audition.

32:55.385 --> 32:58.475
Don't worry, we're alone.

32:58.518 --> 33:00.303
And you were right.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.262
I move too fast, I'm sorry.

33:03.306 --> 33:05.438
My feelings for you,
Kendra, are real.

33:05.482 --> 33:07.179
You're so special.

33:07.223 --> 33:08.833
Get away from me!

33:08.876 --> 33:11.052
And the way I opened up to you,

33:11.096 --> 33:13.011
how I told you about my life,

33:13.054 --> 33:16.406
my family, my feelings,
how lonely I've been,

33:16.449 --> 33:18.756
do you know how many
girls I've told that to?

33:18.799 --> 33:19.757
I don't care.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.454
None.

33:21.498 --> 33:22.499
You're a creep.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.804
You don't mean that.

33:23.848 --> 33:25.415
Yes, I do and if I
see you here again,

33:25.458 --> 33:26.546
I'm going to call the police.

33:26.590 --> 33:28.026
I don't think you understand

33:28.069 --> 33:30.942
how much you mean
to me, Kendra, okay?

33:30.985 --> 33:33.466
Hey, everything okay Kendra?

33:33.510 --> 33:37.209
She's great!
Inspired, I hope.

33:37.253 --> 33:38.776
You just have to remember
the performing arts

33:38.819 --> 33:41.431
are not for the faint of heart.

33:41.474 --> 33:45.261
They're like love in that way.

33:45.304 --> 33:47.828
You have to fight for it.

33:53.356 --> 33:56.010
That was weird.

33:57.664 --> 34:00.406
Mom? You here?

34:14.072 --> 34:18.250
Mom?

34:18.293 --> 34:20.600
Yes, honey?

34:25.301 --> 34:27.520
Are you okay?

34:27.563 --> 34:29.652
I'm fine, honey. I just...

34:29.696 --> 34:32.786
I'm sorry about the other day.

34:32.830 --> 34:36.920
I shouldn't said
that stuff about Ty.

34:36.964 --> 34:39.880
I shouldn't have lied to you.

34:42.666 --> 34:48.672
Thanks, but it's...

34:48.715 --> 34:51.456
It's a little
late for me and Ty.

34:51.501 --> 34:53.242
It's over.

34:53.284 --> 34:55.679
Because of me?

34:55.722 --> 34:58.290
No baby, no.

34:58.334 --> 35:01.206
No, this was all on me.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.165
But I want you to
know something, listen.

35:04.209 --> 35:07.343
If I ever start
seeing someone again.

35:07.386 --> 35:09.301
When.

35:09.345 --> 35:13.958
When I start
seeing someone again,

35:14.001 --> 35:20.791
they will never,
ever replace your father.

35:20.834 --> 35:24.838
Or change the way I
feel about you, ever.

35:32.324 --> 35:37.416
In the spirit of optimism,
I am lifting your punishment.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.723
But no more lying.

35:42.029 --> 35:43.727
I promise.

35:45.163 --> 35:47.992
I better start dinner.

35:48.035 --> 35:50.473
Is there something else?

35:52.475 --> 35:55.565
Nope, I'm all good.

35:55.608 --> 35:57.218
Okay.

36:02.789 --> 36:07.316
I do not think of
myself as a celebrity.

36:07.359 --> 36:11.798
That's how other people see
me, but that's not who I am.

36:11.842 --> 36:15.367
There's a million
girls out there, but...

36:15.411 --> 36:19.850
there's only one for me.

36:19.893 --> 36:24.637
You are so special, Kendra.

36:24.681 --> 36:30.251
I love you. I really,
truly, love you.

36:30.295 --> 36:34.038
You mean everything to me.

36:34.081 --> 36:36.475
And I have to have you.

36:53.274 --> 36:56.626
Sorry, I'm a little lost.

36:56.669 --> 36:59.542
A superstar is obsessed with you

36:59.585 --> 37:01.370
and you don't want
to hook up with him?

37:01.413 --> 37:02.936
Mischa!

37:02.980 --> 37:04.416
Yeah, he's a
little pervy, but...

37:04.460 --> 37:06.331
Celebrity...

37:06.375 --> 37:07.680
Millionaire...

37:07.724 --> 37:09.987
I don't care who he is.

37:10.030 --> 37:11.771
Ooooh, listen to this.

37:11.815 --> 37:15.558
According to Forbes, Brad's
worth over ten million dollars!

37:15.601 --> 37:17.255
If my computer had half
the speed of your phone,

37:17.298 --> 37:19.649
I think I would've
mastered trig already.

37:19.692 --> 37:21.041
Come on!

37:21.085 --> 37:22.739
Computer troubles?

37:22.782 --> 37:25.306
Yeah, I'm getting
beach balled like crazy.

37:25.350 --> 37:27.831
Good news, I'm pretty
good at computers.

37:27.874 --> 37:31.051
I bet you are.

37:31.095 --> 37:32.792
Want me to take a look?

37:32.836 --> 37:34.533
Oh, here's a good one.

37:34.577 --> 37:37.362
"Brad Banton buried himself in
his work after the tragic death

37:37.406 --> 37:39.669
of his girlfriend,
Allison Trasker.

37:39.712 --> 37:41.845
His passion and
dedication has paid off

37:41.888 --> 37:46.806
and this season's ratings
are higher than blah blah blah!

37:46.850 --> 37:51.985
If Brad really is crazy,
then maybe he killed her.

37:53.944 --> 37:55.728
Honey, I'm sorry, that
was a stupid thing to say.

37:55.772 --> 37:57.643
Forget it.

37:57.687 --> 38:00.472
Jake, how are you gonna
fix Kendra's computer?

38:00.516 --> 38:02.909
Umm, can I take
this home with me?

38:02.953 --> 38:04.607
It's gonna take me some
time to figure this one out.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.478
Sure.

38:06.522 --> 38:08.480
Who need trig anyway, right?

38:10.134 --> 38:17.837
I can easier teach twenty
to... to be good, to be...

38:17.881 --> 38:19.709
I'm sorry, can I start again?

38:19.752 --> 38:22.799
I think that would be best.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.324
I can easier...

38:29.370 --> 38:31.155
Miss Peterson?

38:31.198 --> 38:35.028
Will you be returning to
this planet any time soon?

38:38.554 --> 38:41.078
Miss Peterson?

38:41.121 --> 38:43.994
Okay class, let's
take a ten minute break.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.133
Hey, what's wrong?
What's the matter?

38:53.177 --> 38:54.657
Did you see him?

38:54.700 --> 38:56.006
See who?

38:56.049 --> 38:58.878
Brad, did you see him?

38:58.922 --> 39:01.402
Brad Banton?

39:03.317 --> 39:06.364
You don't believe me?

39:06.407 --> 39:08.627
I mean, if Brad Banton
really was here,

39:08.671 --> 39:10.673
don't you think the
whole school would know?

39:10.716 --> 39:16.505
No, not if he was hiding or he
didn't want any of us to see.

39:16.548 --> 39:19.072
You don't believe me. You
know what? I don't even care.

39:19.116 --> 39:21.422
Kendra, where are you going?

39:21.466 --> 39:23.337
Home!

39:41.094 --> 39:43.401
Mom?

39:43.444 --> 39:48.493
Kendra!
I have a big surprise!

39:48.537 --> 39:51.278
See? She's speechless.

39:51.322 --> 39:52.802
I told you she was
your biggest fan.

39:52.845 --> 39:54.760
She's as beautiful as her mom.

39:54.804 --> 39:57.546
Pleased to meet you, Kendra.

39:57.589 --> 40:00.592
Mom, I called you.

40:00.636 --> 40:02.289
I'm sorry, honey.

40:02.333 --> 40:05.423
I had my phone off at work
and when I left the hospital,

40:05.466 --> 40:08.078
my car wouldn't start
and can you believe

40:08.121 --> 40:11.211
who came by and
offered me a lift?

40:11.255 --> 40:13.562
Just like a real
knight in shining armor.

40:13.605 --> 40:16.608
Hardly. Just the right
place at the right time.

40:16.652 --> 40:18.001
What are you doing?

40:18.044 --> 40:19.045
Kendra!

40:19.089 --> 40:21.047
Mom, I need to talk to you.

40:21.091 --> 40:22.092
Stay right there!

40:22.135 --> 40:23.615
I'm so sorry, one second.

40:23.659 --> 40:25.922
Kendra!

40:25.965 --> 40:27.401
What is wrong with you?

40:27.445 --> 40:29.055
Mom, he's crazy.

40:29.099 --> 40:30.143
He's obsessed.

40:30.187 --> 40:31.449
What?

40:31.492 --> 40:32.842
He's insane,
he's been following me,

40:32.885 --> 40:34.800
and harassing me and...

40:34.844 --> 40:36.106
What are you talking about?

40:36.149 --> 40:38.282
Brad, I'm talking about Brad!

40:38.325 --> 40:39.936
We met at a party
the other week.

40:39.979 --> 40:42.982
We went on a date
and he assaulted me!

40:43.026 --> 40:45.202
He's been following
me ever since.

40:45.245 --> 40:47.596
He probably messed with
the engine of your car

40:47.639 --> 40:49.075
so he could pick you up.

40:49.119 --> 40:51.512
So that he could
get closer to me.

40:51.556 --> 40:53.384
I see.

40:53.427 --> 40:56.735
And I think that
he's really dangerous.

40:56.779 --> 41:00.217
So what should we do?

41:00.260 --> 41:01.784
Oh my god...

41:01.827 --> 41:03.916
I know! I mean,
should we call the police?

41:03.960 --> 41:06.484
Why is it that
every time a man comes

41:06.527 --> 41:09.574
within a foot of me,
you start acting this way?

41:09.618 --> 41:11.707
I really thought after
our talk a few days ago

41:11.750 --> 41:13.491
that we'd be past all this.

41:13.534 --> 41:15.362
Mom, I'm not lying.

41:15.406 --> 41:17.364
Brad was at my school today.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.540
He came into my audition...

41:19.584 --> 41:22.326
Brad was at the hospital all day

41:22.369 --> 41:27.461
visiting children with leukemia.

41:27.505 --> 41:29.594
That's impossible.

41:29.638 --> 41:31.509
Children with
real life problems.

41:31.552 --> 41:34.599
Mom, I'm telling the truth.

41:34.643 --> 41:38.385
Are you even
capable of that anymore?

41:38.429 --> 41:39.691
I'm mean, lying about
partying and drinking

41:39.735 --> 41:41.040
is one thing, but this?

41:41.084 --> 41:46.698
Mom, Brad assaulted me.

41:46.742 --> 41:50.006
Just like Ty, right?

41:51.442 --> 41:52.617
Mom...

41:52.661 --> 41:54.619
You stay right there.

41:59.493 --> 42:01.582
Is everything okay?

42:01.626 --> 42:03.323
I am so sorry.

42:03.367 --> 42:04.716
I just...

42:04.760 --> 42:06.587
Hey, no, it's okay.

42:06.631 --> 42:09.808
I don't even
recognize her anymore.

42:09.852 --> 42:11.680
And you didn't sign up for this.

42:11.723 --> 42:13.029
I must seem like a crazy lady.

42:13.072 --> 42:16.293
No, don't worry about it.

42:16.336 --> 42:20.123
She's a teenager, it's a phase.

42:20.166 --> 42:23.039
Thank you, thanks
for understanding.

42:25.781 --> 42:30.699
You're so pretty when
you get upset, all frazzled.

42:30.742 --> 42:34.790
Could I maybe call you?

42:34.833 --> 42:37.183
Yeah, I'd like that.

42:37.227 --> 42:39.272
Me too.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.417
I'll call you later.

42:53.460 --> 42:54.461
Good night.

42:54.505 --> 42:55.636
Good night.

43:06.299 --> 43:10.129
Mom, I know I've lied
before but I'm telling you...

43:10.173 --> 43:12.436
Stop.

43:12.479 --> 43:15.439
You want to tell me why
your school called me today?

43:15.482 --> 43:17.528
Are you cutting class
to go drinking again?

43:17.571 --> 43:19.008
No!

43:19.051 --> 43:20.836
I came home to talk to you.

43:20.879 --> 43:22.185
To tell you about Brad.

43:22.228 --> 43:24.361
Stop.

43:24.404 --> 43:28.060
Please just stop lying with
every single breath you take.

43:28.104 --> 43:30.976
I know that losing dad
was really hard on you,

43:31.020 --> 43:35.546
but you know what?
It was hard on me too.

43:35.589 --> 43:38.462
And I'm really tired
of doing this alone.

43:38.505 --> 43:41.421
And I just thought...

43:41.465 --> 43:43.946
I thought that maybe you
and I could be a team again.

43:43.989 --> 43:46.339
But now I see that
that's not possible!

43:46.383 --> 43:48.167
That I am going to have
to drive you to school,

43:48.211 --> 43:49.908
and pick you up from school,

43:49.952 --> 43:54.130
and get someone to sit with
you when I have a late shift.

43:56.654 --> 43:58.743
Good night.

44:03.879 --> 44:06.011
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

44:09.710 --> 44:12.713
So how was school?

44:23.507 --> 44:25.248
Wait, stop!

44:25.291 --> 44:26.379
What?

44:26.423 --> 44:28.381
Pull over,
pull over right there!

44:28.425 --> 44:30.862
That's the restaurant
Brad took me to.

44:35.084 --> 44:38.261
Hello? Hello?

44:38.304 --> 44:40.045
Kendra, what are we doing here?

44:40.089 --> 44:42.743
Come here.

44:42.787 --> 44:44.049
Sorry, we're not open till...

44:44.093 --> 44:46.530
You! You remember me!

44:46.573 --> 44:47.879
Sorry, no...

44:47.923 --> 44:49.272
Yes, you do.

44:49.315 --> 44:51.665
Kendra, what is this?

44:51.709 --> 44:56.105
I came in with Brad Banton.

44:56.148 --> 44:58.020
Tell her!

44:58.063 --> 44:59.804
I've never seen you before.

44:59.848 --> 45:00.761
What?

45:00.805 --> 45:02.633
We open for dinner at 6.

45:02.676 --> 45:04.504
Why are you doing this?

45:04.548 --> 45:05.984
Did he pay you?

45:06.028 --> 45:07.899
Or what, did he assault you?

45:07.943 --> 45:09.422
Or harass you, or
threaten you or something?

45:09.466 --> 45:10.902
Kendra, enough!

45:10.946 --> 45:13.339
Mom, I was here.
I sat right there!

45:13.383 --> 45:14.775
Let's go.

45:14.819 --> 45:17.517
He's lying!

45:17.561 --> 45:20.825
Brad could've came
back and covered it up.

45:20.869 --> 45:22.914
He could've come back to the
restaurant and talked to him...

45:22.958 --> 45:24.655
Enough, Kendra.

45:24.698 --> 45:26.483
Sorry.

45:32.837 --> 45:35.971
Gail, hi, thanks for coming
over on such short notice.

45:36.014 --> 45:38.147
I can't believe I have
to ask you to do this.

45:38.190 --> 45:39.931
Of course.

45:39.975 --> 45:42.803
There are lots of
leftovers in the fridge.

45:42.847 --> 45:45.415
And if you could just check
on her every hour or so.

45:45.458 --> 45:46.938
Okay, don't worry.

45:46.982 --> 45:50.420
I remember when
my kids were teenagers.

45:50.463 --> 45:52.291
Thank you.

45:52.335 --> 45:54.467
Bye.

46:23.061 --> 46:25.977
Very nice, Mrs. Hall.

46:26.021 --> 46:32.244
You're doing wonderfully,
good job.

46:32.288 --> 46:33.942
Take it easy.

46:33.985 --> 46:36.292
Knock, knock.

46:36.335 --> 46:37.815
Oh, sweet daisies.

46:37.858 --> 46:39.948
Special delivery.

46:39.991 --> 46:42.037
I was upstairs
visiting the kids and

46:42.080 --> 46:43.603
I thought maybe I'd
come down and see

46:43.647 --> 46:45.954
if you wanted to
join me for a coffee?

46:45.997 --> 46:47.738
Uh, I'm sort of in
the middle of something...

46:47.781 --> 46:50.349
I'm all better.

46:50.393 --> 46:53.048
No more therapy today, I think.

46:54.397 --> 46:55.920
Coffee will be fine.

47:03.884 --> 47:06.017
I'm gonna be honest.

47:06.061 --> 47:08.063
The coffee is horrific.

47:08.106 --> 47:09.629
I know, I'm sorry.

47:09.673 --> 47:11.849
It's okay.

47:13.633 --> 47:16.027
I have to say,
you're not what I expected.

47:16.071 --> 47:17.768
No? What do you mean?

47:17.811 --> 47:19.813
Big TV star and all,

47:19.857 --> 47:21.467
I thought maybe
you'd have a "guy."

47:21.511 --> 47:23.295
A "guy?"

47:23.339 --> 47:25.602
Yeah, like a
personal assistant guy.

47:25.645 --> 47:29.736
Some 20-something kid,
fresh out of school

47:29.780 --> 47:32.304
follows you around to
get you coffee and stuff.

47:32.348 --> 47:36.004
Well, I don't
have one of those...

47:36.047 --> 47:40.269
but you should come
visit me on the show sometime.

47:40.312 --> 47:41.444
You could bring your daughter.

47:41.487 --> 47:43.707
She's a big fan, right?

47:43.750 --> 47:46.057
Yes, she is.

47:46.101 --> 47:48.277
I don't know if Kendra and I

47:48.320 --> 47:50.366
can occupy the
same space right now.

47:50.409 --> 47:52.411
Ah.

47:52.455 --> 47:56.676
But that sounds great,
I'd love to.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.678
Let me know, I'll
take good care of you.

48:04.467 --> 48:06.077
I'm looking forward to it.

48:06.121 --> 48:08.123
No, that sounds like fun.

48:08.166 --> 48:10.995
Okay, I'll see you Saturday.

48:11.039 --> 48:13.345
Thanks, Brad.

48:13.389 --> 48:15.086
Hey, Gail, how'd it go?

48:15.130 --> 48:16.827
Everything's fine!

48:18.524 --> 48:19.438
Well, hello.

48:19.482 --> 48:21.353
What the hell are you doing?

48:21.397 --> 48:23.268
You know what I'm doing.

48:23.312 --> 48:25.314
You stay away from
my mother or I swear...

48:25.357 --> 48:28.665
Kendra, I knew you would call.

48:28.708 --> 48:30.797
What is wrong with you?

48:33.278 --> 48:36.803
You're so special.

48:36.847 --> 48:39.328
My Cinderella.

48:39.371 --> 48:43.941
I need to be close to you,
and if this is the only way,

48:43.984 --> 48:45.116
then so be it.

48:47.597 --> 48:50.687
You love me too.

48:50.730 --> 48:53.081
You'll see.

48:58.086 --> 49:00.175
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you the other day,

49:00.218 --> 49:01.480
but I'm with you now.

49:01.524 --> 49:03.308
We're gonna catch this lunatic.

49:03.352 --> 49:06.050
It's not that easy,
he's covered his tracks.

49:06.094 --> 49:08.357
Yeah? Well he's messing
with Generation Z.

49:08.400 --> 49:11.316
We're the smartest,
most connected, most...

49:13.101 --> 49:14.711
I got it!

49:14.754 --> 49:15.712
What?

49:15.755 --> 49:16.626
Come on!

49:20.717 --> 49:24.112
Open this one.

49:24.155 --> 49:27.376
Where is that creep?

49:27.419 --> 49:30.379
How is there not one
picture of you two together?

49:30.422 --> 49:32.424
He's smart.

49:32.468 --> 49:34.122
He got me away
as quick as he could.

49:34.165 --> 49:36.863
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

49:36.907 --> 49:38.300
Hey Jake, thanks
for the computer stuff,

49:38.343 --> 49:39.562
but I really don't have time...

49:39.605 --> 49:41.520
No, look.

49:44.088 --> 49:46.743
Sorry, we don't speak nerd.

49:46.786 --> 49:49.006
It's spyware.

49:49.049 --> 49:50.660
Like a virus or something?

49:50.703 --> 49:52.618
No, like real spyware.

49:52.662 --> 49:54.446
Someone installed this
tracking software so they

49:54.490 --> 49:56.405
can check on everything
you're doing on this computer.

49:56.448 --> 49:59.277
Every file, every password,
every search.

49:59.321 --> 50:01.540
They have it all.

50:01.584 --> 50:02.889
Holy crap.

50:02.933 --> 50:04.848
There's something else.

50:04.891 --> 50:08.330
I'm pretty sure this
was installed directly.

50:08.373 --> 50:10.462
Meaning what?

50:10.506 --> 50:12.769
Meaning whoever
did this, did it manually.

50:12.812 --> 50:14.771
As in, not over the net.

50:14.814 --> 50:17.208
They uploaded this in person.

50:17.252 --> 50:20.080
He was in my house...

50:20.124 --> 50:22.126
We got his ass now though.

50:26.348 --> 50:28.741
It'll be in evidence
holding for several weeks.

50:30.047 --> 50:31.266
I understand.

50:31.309 --> 50:34.530
Good, if you could
just sign here for me.

50:34.573 --> 50:37.750
And I will also need
your guardian's permission.

50:37.794 --> 50:40.318
I texted, she's on her way.

50:40.362 --> 50:42.842
We take cyber
stalking very seriously,

50:42.886 --> 50:46.106
so if this guy is harassing
you either digitally,

50:46.150 --> 50:49.545
or in person, or both,
we'll put a stop to it.

50:49.588 --> 50:51.329
Thank you.

50:51.373 --> 50:53.636
Kendra, what is going on?

50:53.679 --> 50:57.030
Mom, I can prove it.

50:57.074 --> 50:58.641
Brad's been spying on me.

50:58.684 --> 50:59.685
What?

50:59.729 --> 51:01.470
He's spying on my computer.

51:01.513 --> 51:03.472
I'm Detective Glenn Barrett.

51:03.515 --> 51:05.082
We have to run a
full diagnostic,

51:05.125 --> 51:07.258
but it does look like the
device has been tampered with.

51:07.302 --> 51:07.954
The computer?

51:07.998 --> 51:09.129
That's right.

51:09.173 --> 51:10.261
I was just telling
your daughter that

51:10.305 --> 51:13.395
we take cyber stalking
very seriously...

51:13.438 --> 51:19.139
I did it, I put the
spyware on the computer.

51:19.183 --> 51:22.186
She's been lying,
I did some research.

51:22.230 --> 51:24.754
I thought it might help.

51:24.797 --> 51:27.017
How could you do that to me?

51:27.060 --> 51:30.150
Ma'am, your daughter's made
some very serious allegations.

51:30.194 --> 51:32.588
She said that a Mr.
Brad Banton assaulted her.

51:32.631 --> 51:33.850
That is not what happened.

51:33.893 --> 51:36.287
Yes, it is.

51:36.331 --> 51:40.422
Look, she lost her father.

51:40.465 --> 51:44.252
She doesn't like the idea of
me having a new man in my life.

51:44.295 --> 51:47.429
Be that as it may, when a
minor alleges an assault,

51:47.472 --> 51:51.128
I have to follow up.
You understand?

51:51.171 --> 51:55.045
That said, we also take false
allegations very seriously.

51:55.088 --> 51:59.702
So ladies, if there's anything
that needs to get said,

51:59.745 --> 52:01.921
now would be the time.

52:04.359 --> 52:08.537
Kendra, this is important.
You need to tell the truth.

52:08.580 --> 52:11.017
Mom, I am!

52:11.061 --> 52:13.585
Honey, we can talk
about this later,

52:13.629 --> 52:15.935
but you need to tell the
detective the truth now.

52:15.979 --> 52:19.504
No, no!

52:19.548 --> 52:24.379
Brad is stalking me,
he assaulted me.

52:24.422 --> 52:29.253
Alright, well, we'll let
you know what we find out.

52:29.297 --> 52:31.081
I'll leave this here with you.

52:31.124 --> 52:32.474
We will see
ourselves to the door.

52:32.517 --> 52:34.519
Let's roll.

52:42.832 --> 52:45.225
You are not being
charged at this time.

52:45.269 --> 52:48.446
In fact, you are welcome to have
an attorney present during our...

52:48.490 --> 52:50.013
I'm a lawyer.

52:50.056 --> 52:52.363
And Brad is an upstanding
member of the community

52:52.407 --> 52:54.409
whose only crime is
going on a date with a woman

52:54.452 --> 52:57.107
whose daughter
is an abject liar.

52:57.150 --> 52:59.501
I'd actually like to
hear from Mr. Banton,

52:59.544 --> 53:01.633
if that's alright with you?

53:01.677 --> 53:03.505
It's fine.

53:03.548 --> 53:04.810
Linn told me that
Kendra's been working

53:04.854 --> 53:06.943
through some personal issues.

53:06.986 --> 53:09.554
She lost her father overseas.

53:09.598 --> 53:13.210
In my case, she recognized
me from the show and...

53:13.253 --> 53:16.735
seems to have gotten
carried away with a fantasy.

53:16.779 --> 53:19.172
So you weren't with Kendra
on the night of April 12?

53:19.216 --> 53:20.565
I was not.

53:20.609 --> 53:21.610
Can you prove it?

53:21.653 --> 53:24.090
He was with me, at our offices.

53:24.134 --> 53:26.441
My assistant can confirm it.

53:26.484 --> 53:28.747
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time, detective.

53:28.791 --> 53:31.228
I hope to handle
this unpleasantness

53:31.271 --> 53:34.144
as painlessly as possible.

53:34.187 --> 53:37.626
The girl lost her
father, after all.

53:39.018 --> 53:41.891
All right, well thank
you both for your time.

53:41.934 --> 53:43.196
I will see myself out to the door.

53:43.240 --> 53:44.241
Okay.

53:44.284 --> 53:44.981
Take care.

53:45.024 --> 53:46.591
You too.

53:52.989 --> 53:54.338
That was humiliating.

53:58.647 --> 54:00.736
I told you to stop seeing that girl.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.216
I told you she's no good...

54:06.872 --> 54:08.570
I can only protect you...

54:08.613 --> 54:14.967
I don't need you to
protect me anymore.

54:34.247 --> 54:38.034
Do you even realize
how serious this is?

54:38.077 --> 54:40.166
I mean, making false
allegations to the police?

54:40.210 --> 54:42.038
If Brad wanted to press charges...

54:42.081 --> 54:44.432
But he's lying...
they're all lying.

54:48.348 --> 54:51.569
I have spoken to a psychiatrist

54:51.613 --> 54:54.311
and I think I've found one
that you might even like.

54:54.354 --> 54:57.009
I don't need a psychiatrist!

54:57.053 --> 54:59.838
Wow, you look gorgeous!

54:59.882 --> 55:01.100
Hope you have a good time,

55:01.144 --> 55:02.885
I don't want you to
worry about anything.

55:02.928 --> 55:05.235
Thank you, Gail.

55:05.278 --> 55:08.543
I don't know what
I would do without you.

55:08.586 --> 55:10.719
Hey, if it isn't
too much trouble,

55:10.762 --> 55:13.765
could I get a picture of Brad?

55:13.809 --> 55:16.812
Like an autograph, maybe?

55:16.855 --> 55:19.292
No trouble, I'll ask.

55:19.336 --> 55:21.381
Okay, thanks.

55:22.731 --> 55:25.385
We are not done here.

55:28.171 --> 55:31.174
Could I get a picture of Brad?

55:32.567 --> 55:34.699
Whoa, that's retro.

55:42.315 --> 55:43.273
Hello?

55:43.316 --> 55:44.274
Jake?

55:44.317 --> 55:45.841
Yeah.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.233
It's Kendra.

55:47.277 --> 55:49.192
Hey, everything okay?

55:49.235 --> 55:51.194
I need a favor.

55:56.286 --> 55:57.983
Are you Gail Perkins?

55:58.027 --> 55:59.202
Yes, but how do you know that?

55:59.245 --> 56:01.160
Delivery from Linn Peterson.

56:01.204 --> 56:04.947
Oh my, thank you.

56:04.990 --> 56:08.037
That Linn is such a sweetheart.

56:08.080 --> 56:09.821
Have a good one!

56:18.700 --> 56:20.789
Hey!

56:20.832 --> 56:23.487
Hey, thank you so much for that.

56:23.531 --> 56:25.576
Gail is such a lush, she
had half the bottle already.

56:25.620 --> 56:27.578
So she's gonna be asleep
the rest of the afternoon.

56:27.622 --> 56:29.101
Thank you!

56:29.145 --> 56:30.799
So now what? Are you
going to Brad's by yourself?

56:30.842 --> 56:31.843
Yeah.

56:31.887 --> 56:33.062
What for?

56:33.105 --> 56:34.585
To get the proof
that I was there.

56:34.629 --> 56:36.282
The proof that's
gonna save me and my mom.

56:36.326 --> 56:37.545
What proof?

56:37.588 --> 56:39.851
He took a picture, a Polaroid.

56:39.895 --> 56:42.462
So you're gonna steal it?

56:42.506 --> 56:44.552
Something like that.

56:47.163 --> 56:48.643
What are you doing?

56:48.686 --> 56:49.644
I'm coming too.

56:49.687 --> 56:51.036
Jake!

56:51.080 --> 56:53.561
Sounds dangerous,
you need a wingman.

56:53.604 --> 56:56.651
Come on, let's go.

56:56.694 --> 56:58.478
Okay.

57:12.580 --> 57:14.799
Linn!

57:14.843 --> 57:17.759
Thank you for coming.
My god!

57:17.802 --> 57:18.977
Can I give you a tour?

57:19.021 --> 57:20.718
Wait.

57:20.762 --> 57:23.547
I would love that, but first
I need to tell you something.

57:23.591 --> 57:25.723
Okay.

57:25.767 --> 57:29.597
You've been so kind and patient

57:29.640 --> 57:32.904
and there just aren't
a lot of guys out there

57:32.948 --> 57:35.733
who would've been so generous
under the circumstances.

57:35.777 --> 57:37.474
Hey, it's okay.

57:37.517 --> 57:39.911
No, it's really not.

57:39.955 --> 57:42.392
She's gonna be fine, she's just
going through a lot right now.

57:42.435 --> 57:44.655
That's all.

57:44.699 --> 57:47.136
How can you be so kind?

57:47.179 --> 57:49.486
My dad left when I was young.

57:49.529 --> 57:53.533
So I kind of understand
what she's going through.

57:53.577 --> 57:56.319
It's tough on a kid.

57:58.147 --> 58:01.498
And on a mom.

58:01.541 --> 58:04.762
But that doesn't mean
that we give up, right?

58:04.806 --> 58:06.546
Would you mind if
I just took a second

58:06.590 --> 58:07.547
and checked in with Kendra?

58:07.591 --> 58:08.766
Yes, of course.

58:08.810 --> 58:10.159
I'll be right back.

58:10.202 --> 58:12.204
Of course, take your time.

58:30.658 --> 58:32.398
Would you excuse me one second?

58:32.442 --> 58:34.183
Everything okay?

58:34.226 --> 58:38.143
Yes, well Kendra didn't pick up,
but that's no surprise.

58:38.187 --> 58:39.884
But the sitter
didn't pick up, either.

58:39.928 --> 58:42.191
Is that unusual?

58:42.234 --> 58:47.849
Not exactly, but I have a
little 21st century mom power.

58:47.892 --> 58:49.764
You track her phone?

58:49.807 --> 58:52.680
Yeah and she's at home,
so that's a relief.

58:56.988 --> 59:01.297
I'm sure.

59:01.340 --> 59:03.255
Linn, I'm sorry but I
have to excuse myself,

59:03.299 --> 59:06.258
I have a last minute
network meeting.

59:06.302 --> 59:07.738
Can I make it up to you?

59:07.782 --> 59:09.653
Sure, no problem.

59:22.971 --> 59:25.669
I don't see anything.

59:46.211 --> 59:49.911
No, no, no! He'd
keep it in his room.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.538
Oh no, it's not here.

01:00:13.064 --> 01:00:15.806
Where's the damn light?

01:00:20.855 --> 01:00:24.249
Hey, in here!
Look at this...

01:00:25.947 --> 01:00:27.339
Oh my god.

01:00:27.383 --> 01:00:29.472
The girlfriend?

01:00:29.515 --> 01:00:33.345
Ex-girlfriend, Allison Trasker.

01:00:40.483 --> 01:00:42.354
Kendra!

01:00:42.398 --> 01:00:45.401
That's the picture!

01:00:47.751 --> 01:00:49.231
Come on!

01:00:51.755 --> 01:00:53.017
What're you doing? Let's go!

01:00:53.061 --> 01:00:53.888
I'll be right behind you.

01:00:53.931 --> 01:00:54.845
No, let's go!

01:00:54.889 --> 01:00:56.716
Just go, I'll be two seconds.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.806
All right, well hurry!

01:01:10.687 --> 01:01:11.862
Jake!

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.609
Got you, jerk.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:25.267
Jake!

01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:37.714
You look familiar.

01:01:37.757 --> 01:01:40.108
So do you.

01:01:40.151 --> 01:01:42.414
You're Brad Banton, right?

01:01:42.458 --> 01:01:44.677
The famous pervert.

01:01:44.721 --> 01:01:46.505
A loser who can't
get a girl his own age,

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:50.770
so he stalks teenagers
from his old high school.

01:01:50.814 --> 01:01:54.862
That must make
you the naive nerd,

01:01:54.905 --> 01:02:01.259
hopelessly in love with
a girl far beyond his station.

01:02:01.303 --> 01:02:06.569
I'm sorry kid, but you don't
get the girl in this movie.

01:02:21.976 --> 01:02:24.413
Jake? Come on!

01:02:25.805 --> 01:02:27.633
Jake?

01:02:37.556 --> 01:02:39.167
Jake?

01:03:02.016 --> 01:03:05.410
Jake? No, wait!

01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:08.805
Wait!

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:13.418
What're you doing? Stop!

01:03:55.852 --> 01:03:57.027
Kendra?

01:03:57.071 --> 01:03:58.333
Stop it, gimme those!

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.075
What are you doing?
Did you follow me here?

01:04:04.252 --> 01:04:05.035
Where is he?

01:04:05.079 --> 01:04:05.993
Who?

01:04:06.036 --> 01:04:07.124
Jake!

01:04:07.168 --> 01:04:08.647
What are you
talking about, Kendra?

01:04:08.691 --> 01:04:10.432
Shut up, you son of a bitch!
Where did you put him?

01:04:15.089 --> 01:04:17.047
It was all here.

01:04:17.091 --> 01:04:20.355
Uh-huh... follow me.

01:04:24.098 --> 01:04:26.491
It was all here.

01:04:32.976 --> 01:04:36.066
You stand over there.

01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:37.372
Is all this really necessary?

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:39.069
Yes, it is.

01:04:39.113 --> 01:04:40.940
Upstairs is clear sir, no kid.

01:04:40.984 --> 01:04:42.638
No he's here, he has to be here.

01:04:42.681 --> 01:04:44.466
Quiet, Miss Peterson.

01:04:44.509 --> 01:04:46.859
Now at this time, Mr. Banton
is not pursuing any charges...

01:04:46.903 --> 01:04:48.252
I'm sure it's
just kids being kids.

01:04:48.296 --> 01:04:50.515
But if he changes his mind,

01:04:50.559 --> 01:04:53.866
anything you say
can be used in court.

01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:55.999
There's really no need
to scare her, Detective.

01:04:56.043 --> 01:04:57.653
No harm done.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:04.442
I'm Linn Peterson, I got
a call about my daughter.

01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:07.619
You know what?

01:05:07.663 --> 01:05:11.101
I'm surprised that you don't
have any home surveillance.

01:05:11.145 --> 01:05:13.190
Big celebrity like yourself?

01:05:13.234 --> 01:05:15.671
I haven't had the need.

01:05:15.714 --> 01:05:16.976
Kendra, are you okay?

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.978
No ma'am, she is not.

01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:20.719
Your daughter just
broke into a private home.

01:05:20.763 --> 01:05:22.112
What?

01:05:22.156 --> 01:05:23.331
Now if something
like this happens again,

01:05:23.374 --> 01:05:25.115
I don't care
what Mr. Banton says.

01:05:25.159 --> 01:05:28.118
The city's gonna press charges.

01:05:28.162 --> 01:05:30.077
We understand.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:31.295
What about Jake?

01:05:31.339 --> 01:05:32.644
Have you even
called his parents yet?

01:05:32.688 --> 01:05:35.299
Yes, they are very concerned.

01:05:35.343 --> 01:05:37.519
They're also not pleased
that he broke into

01:05:37.562 --> 01:05:39.869
the family liquor cabinet
and stole wine.

01:05:39.912 --> 01:05:41.218
You need to listen to me.

01:05:41.262 --> 01:05:42.959
No, you need to listen.

01:05:43.002 --> 01:05:45.353
We're gonna continue
to search for this boy,

01:05:45.396 --> 01:05:47.529
but if you keep wasting
the time and the resources

01:05:47.572 --> 01:05:50.053
of this police department,

01:05:50.097 --> 01:05:52.273
you're gonna find
yourself behind bars.

01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:57.060
It won't happen
again, Detective.

01:05:57.104 --> 01:05:59.367
See that it doesn't.

01:05:59.410 --> 01:06:00.368
I'm so sorry.

01:06:00.411 --> 01:06:01.934
It's okay.

01:06:01.978 --> 01:06:04.023
Mom, I'm not lying...

01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:20.083
Hello? Jake?

01:06:20.127 --> 01:06:22.868
Jake?

01:06:50.983 --> 01:06:54.552
Sorry for just dropping by.

01:06:54.596 --> 01:06:56.250
What's going on?

01:06:58.426 --> 01:07:01.342
Is everything okay?

01:07:01.385 --> 01:07:04.867
I don't know know what's
actually going on with Kendra.

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:07.870
But whatever it is,
you and I together

01:07:07.913 --> 01:07:10.394
is just not healthy for her.

01:07:10.438 --> 01:07:13.441
So I've decided
that we shouldn't

01:07:13.484 --> 01:07:16.008
see each other anymore.

01:07:16.052 --> 01:07:18.228
But I already said I
wouldn't press any charges.

01:07:18.272 --> 01:07:21.231
And I'm so grateful...

01:07:21.275 --> 01:07:24.060
But I've made up my mind.

01:07:24.103 --> 01:07:28.107
Linn, it's gonna
be okay, I promise.

01:07:28.151 --> 01:07:29.718
It's gonna be fine.

01:07:29.761 --> 01:07:32.416
I'm sorry.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.201
I can't believe this.

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:40.119
Can you just give
me one second, please?

01:07:40.163 --> 01:07:42.644
Just sit down, one minute.

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:17.287
So that's where it went.

01:08:19.898 --> 01:08:26.122
I know this is hard to accept,
but Kendra's so young.

01:08:26.165 --> 01:08:28.167
She doesn't understand
her feelings yet

01:08:28.211 --> 01:08:32.171
or know how special she is.

01:08:32.215 --> 01:08:35.913
Or know what real
love truly feels like.

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:41.920
You're sick.

01:08:41.964 --> 01:08:45.620
She loves me too...
you'll see.

01:08:46.837 --> 01:08:51.278
You stay away from my daughter!

01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:53.236
I can't do that, Linn.

01:08:57.371 --> 01:08:59.502
We're meant for one another.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.048
I found it!

01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:24.398
Mom!

01:09:24.441 --> 01:09:27.314
I'm so sorry.

01:09:27.357 --> 01:09:31.055
I am so, so sorry.

01:09:35.452 --> 01:09:37.845
We will make this right.

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:51.773
Look, I'm sorry but this is not evidence.

01:09:51.816 --> 01:09:54.166
I found it in Brad's house.

01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:56.691
It was left there
when he assaulted her.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:58.562
It proves she was
there that night.

01:09:58.606 --> 01:10:01.130
Or you placed it there
the night that you broke in.

01:10:01.173 --> 01:10:03.088
No I didn't, that
wasn't what happened.

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.481
She's telling the truth.

01:10:04.525 --> 01:10:06.614
Ma'am, up until
the day she broke in,

01:10:06.657 --> 01:10:09.486
you were the one
telling me she was lying.

01:10:11.009 --> 01:10:13.055
Have you even tried
looking for Jake?

01:10:13.098 --> 01:10:15.231
We know that he's
still using his cell phone.

01:10:15.274 --> 01:10:16.667
We're gonna find him soon.

01:10:16.711 --> 01:10:18.408
That is not even
close to good enough.

01:10:18.452 --> 01:10:20.932
Ma'am, do you know the story
of the boy that cried wolf?

01:10:20.976 --> 01:10:23.761
Yes, it ends with
a real damn wolf.

01:10:25.807 --> 01:10:29.332
The little tramp is a liar
and her mom is a nurse

01:10:29.376 --> 01:10:32.770
with a refinanced tract
house in the valley.

01:10:32.814 --> 01:10:35.338
If you can't figure
out how to crush this,

01:10:35.382 --> 01:10:37.775
what the hell are
we paying you for?

01:10:40.648 --> 01:10:42.519
Lawyers say a pay off
could be construed

01:10:42.563 --> 01:10:45.217
as an admission of guilt.

01:10:45.261 --> 01:10:48.395
Do you have any
idea what you've done?

01:10:48.438 --> 01:10:49.700
What this could do to you?

01:10:49.744 --> 01:10:52.268
It doesn't matter.

01:10:52.311 --> 01:10:56.228
We started with nothing
and now you're an empire.

01:10:56.272 --> 01:10:59.188
You want to lose all that
for some teenage girl?

01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:04.367
She doesn't love you.

01:11:07.065 --> 01:11:10.634
Bradley, you're hurting me!

01:11:13.768 --> 01:11:15.857
Kendra's mine.

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:19.904
There's nothing
you can do about it.

01:11:29.479 --> 01:11:32.439
Lock the door.
Okay.

01:11:32.482 --> 01:11:33.831
So, what are we gonna do?

01:11:33.875 --> 01:11:34.745
I don't know.

01:11:34.789 --> 01:11:36.399
What about Jake?

01:11:36.443 --> 01:11:37.661
I don't know honey,
I don't know.

01:11:37.705 --> 01:11:40.447
But we will figure
this out, I promise.

01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.144
I'm gonna call one
of dad's army friends.

01:11:42.187 --> 01:11:43.580
Maybe he can help.

01:11:43.624 --> 01:11:45.147
Okay.

01:11:46.365 --> 01:11:48.237
I'm going to get a water.

01:12:03.557 --> 01:12:06.342
Thanks Robert, I
really appreciate it.

01:12:08.779 --> 01:12:10.694
Kendra?

01:12:12.043 --> 01:12:14.132
I'm going to call you back.

01:12:17.527 --> 01:12:19.703
Kendra?

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.580
Kendra? Kendra!

01:12:28.016 --> 01:12:32.542
Yeah? No, I
completely understand.

01:12:32.586 --> 01:12:36.024
Look, thanks for
running it down for me.

01:12:36.067 --> 01:12:40.202
Yeah sure, let me
know if anything changes.

01:12:40.245 --> 01:12:41.551
Did you find...

01:12:41.595 --> 01:12:42.639
We found Mr. Banton.

01:12:42.683 --> 01:12:43.684
Where is he?

01:12:43.727 --> 01:12:44.728
He doesn't have her.

01:12:44.772 --> 01:12:46.382
What?

01:12:46.425 --> 01:12:48.253
He's been at the studio,
he's been there since noon.

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.168
That is impossible.

01:12:50.212 --> 01:12:52.475
Look, I sent a unit
over to his house.

01:12:52.519 --> 01:12:56.218
We're searching it just in case.

01:12:56.261 --> 01:12:59.134
I promise to do everything
in my power to find her.

01:12:59.177 --> 01:13:01.528
But I gotta to ask...

01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:02.790
A lot of young people know that

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:05.575
their families
track their phones.

01:13:05.619 --> 01:13:09.274
Is it possible that she
left hers behind on purpose?

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.798
No.

01:13:10.841 --> 01:13:13.235
Come on now, I know you
two weren't getting along.

01:13:13.278 --> 01:13:17.282
So is it possible that Kendra
wanted some time alone?

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:19.676
Or she wanted to hang out
with her friend, Jake?

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.159
Maybe she and Jake are
gonna run away together?

01:13:24.202 --> 01:13:26.857
That is not
what's going on here.

01:13:35.431 --> 01:13:38.565
Oh, you're awake.

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:44.658
I suggest that you
don't give me any trouble.

01:13:44.701 --> 01:13:45.963
You're helping him?

01:13:46.007 --> 01:13:48.531
Helping?

01:13:48.575 --> 01:13:54.450
Honey, I had to tie Bradley's
shoe laces until he was 11.

01:13:54.493 --> 01:13:56.583
I've been cleaning up
after my love-sick little boy

01:13:56.626 --> 01:14:00.674
since he wet his first diaper.

01:14:00.717 --> 01:14:04.155
You're his mom?

01:14:04.199 --> 01:14:09.247
See, Bradley's
always been a little soft.

01:14:09.291 --> 01:14:12.076
You get rolled over in
this life when you're soft.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.211
So he needs me to protect him,

01:14:16.254 --> 01:14:19.606
to do the things he can't.

01:14:19.649 --> 01:14:22.304
Like dealing with your friend.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.572
And disposing of any evidence.

01:14:30.965 --> 01:14:32.923
I had to do the same
thing with that little tramp,

01:14:32.967 --> 01:14:34.664
Allison Trasker.

01:14:37.754 --> 01:14:39.669
I drove her car
out to the desert,

01:14:39.713 --> 01:14:42.672
stuck it in drive,
and sent it over a cliff.

01:14:42.716 --> 01:14:45.457
With her in the driver's seat.

01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:48.460
You understand now?

01:14:48.504 --> 01:14:51.594
It's a mother's responsibility.

01:14:51.638 --> 01:14:56.730
We take care of our
children, no matter what.

01:14:56.773 --> 01:15:01.125
Sadly, you won't get to
know what that feels like.

01:15:12.746 --> 01:15:13.834
I hope you find her.

01:15:13.877 --> 01:15:15.662
Oh, we will.

01:15:15.705 --> 01:15:17.402
And thanks for the autograph,

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.491
I think my daughter's
gonna be very happy.

01:15:19.535 --> 01:15:21.668
Oh, come on! Anytime!
Tell her I said hi.

01:15:21.711 --> 01:15:22.843
I will.

01:15:22.886 --> 01:15:24.714
Alright guys, have a good night.

01:16:15.591 --> 01:16:17.462
Jake...

01:17:06.947 --> 01:17:11.168
Mother? Hello?

01:17:18.828 --> 01:17:20.874
Mom?

01:17:31.319 --> 01:17:33.843
What, no damn signal?

01:17:42.678 --> 01:17:44.767
Oh my god, Kendra!

01:17:44.811 --> 01:17:46.508
No, you gotta let me help you.

01:17:46.551 --> 01:17:48.466
You gotta trust me.

01:17:51.078 --> 01:17:52.340
Come on!

01:17:54.385 --> 01:17:55.517
Almost there.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.779
Yes!

01:17:59.042 --> 01:17:59.869
Get away from me!

01:17:59.913 --> 01:18:01.740
No no, I didn't do this!

01:18:01.784 --> 01:18:03.438
You don't understand, we gotta
get out of here right now!

01:18:03.481 --> 01:18:05.266
I'm not gonna leave him.

01:18:05.309 --> 01:18:07.050
Fine.

01:18:07.094 --> 01:18:10.967
Detective, I promise you there
is something happening here.

01:18:11.011 --> 01:18:12.926
You need to get here
as fast as you can.

01:18:15.885 --> 01:18:17.408
Proof of a crime?

01:18:17.452 --> 01:18:21.195
Fine, how do you like this...
Breaking and entering?

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:23.284
Okay, you saw somebody
break into the house.

01:18:23.327 --> 01:18:25.286
Can you describe this person?

01:18:25.329 --> 01:18:30.421
Blonde, 5'5", grey top,
black pants, got it?

01:18:36.819 --> 01:18:38.255
Almost there.

01:18:40.692 --> 01:18:42.781
That's enough, Bradley.

01:18:42.825 --> 01:18:44.261
Get in there!

01:18:44.305 --> 01:18:46.655
Mom, please don't do this!

01:18:46.698 --> 01:18:49.658
I don't have a choice.

01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:53.401
It's for your own good.

01:19:00.712 --> 01:19:01.844
Brad, help us.

01:19:01.888 --> 01:19:04.281
Shut up!

01:19:04.325 --> 01:19:06.805
You can't turn my
own boy against me.

01:19:12.811 --> 01:19:15.031
Mom please, just let them go.

01:19:15.075 --> 01:19:17.686
I love her.

01:19:17.729 --> 01:19:20.558
My poor, sweet child.

01:19:20.602 --> 01:19:23.561
I know you think you
feel something for her,

01:19:23.605 --> 01:19:26.608
but you're confused...

01:19:26.651 --> 01:19:30.351
Just like before.

01:19:30.394 --> 01:19:32.483
She doesn't love you.

01:19:35.443 --> 01:19:40.361
She will... you'll see.

01:19:40.404 --> 01:19:42.929
She hates you.

01:19:42.972 --> 01:19:45.366
Don't listen to her.

01:19:45.409 --> 01:19:47.846
Now that I have
them both together,

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:51.154
there can be another accident.

01:19:51.198 --> 01:19:53.896
They're just two kids
who ran away from home.

01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:55.637
Only to drive off a cliff.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:58.553
Brad, stop her...

01:19:58.596 --> 01:20:01.425
I'll take care of everything.

01:20:01.469 --> 01:20:04.254
Don't worry, I'll
take care of everything.

01:20:04.298 --> 01:20:10.826
I told you I don't need
you to protect me anymore.

01:20:20.096 --> 01:20:23.795
I'm not gonna let you
take her away from me.

01:20:23.839 --> 01:20:27.843
Now back off!

01:20:27.886 --> 01:20:31.064
I have to...
don't you see?

01:20:31.107 --> 01:20:34.328
Back off!

01:20:34.371 --> 01:20:36.286
She'll get you in trouble.

01:20:38.114 --> 01:20:40.029
They'll take you away from me

01:20:40.073 --> 01:20:41.900
and I love you too
much to let that happen.

01:20:41.944 --> 01:20:44.164
Stop, please!

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:46.688
I know it hurts.

01:20:46.731 --> 01:20:50.039
Mom, don't please!

01:20:50.083 --> 01:20:53.216
I know what it's like
to have your heart broken.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:56.045
When your father left, you
were just a tiny little thing.

01:20:56.089 --> 01:20:58.134
Don't make me do this.

01:20:58.178 --> 01:21:02.051
All of a sudden, it was
just you and me alone,

01:21:02.095 --> 01:21:04.706
in this nasty world.

01:21:09.493 --> 01:21:11.408
But I looked into
your beautiful eyes

01:21:11.452 --> 01:21:14.498
and I saw the most
loving, handsome,

01:21:14.542 --> 01:21:16.500
talented boy in the world.

01:21:16.544 --> 01:21:18.633
And I knew
everything would be alright.

01:21:18.676 --> 01:21:21.723
That we didn't need him,
because together

01:21:21.766 --> 01:21:24.421
we could be rich and
famous and powerful.

01:21:24.465 --> 01:21:27.990
Just you and me!
Just the two of us.

01:21:28.034 --> 01:21:30.079
You're not like her.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.955
I don't want to hurt you.

01:21:36.999 --> 01:21:39.262
It's better this way.

01:21:41.873 --> 01:21:43.919
My sweet boy.

01:21:49.272 --> 01:21:51.100
No, don't!

01:21:53.233 --> 01:21:57.324
God you sick bitch,
what is wrong with you?

01:21:57.367 --> 01:21:58.977
You on the other hand...

01:22:01.719 --> 01:22:03.417
Mom!

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:04.809
Honey, are you okay?

01:22:04.853 --> 01:22:07.508
Yeah I'm okay, but
Jake needs your help.

01:22:09.336 --> 01:22:11.555
Elevate his feet.
His pulse is low.

01:22:11.599 --> 01:22:14.515
Jake, can you
hear me? Jake?

01:22:14.558 --> 01:22:16.169
You've got a concussion.

01:22:16.212 --> 01:22:19.868
You're gonna be fine,
help is on the way.

01:22:19.911 --> 01:22:22.871
Kendra?

01:22:22.914 --> 01:22:25.047
Hey, I'm right here.

01:22:25.091 --> 01:22:26.831
Hold on.

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.703
We will get you out of here
real soon.

01:22:28.746 --> 01:22:30.487
Just don't move, okay?

01:22:30.531 --> 01:22:32.794
I'm right here, just don't move.

01:22:34.361 --> 01:22:35.753
This ends now!

01:22:35.797 --> 01:22:37.538
Put the gun down.

01:22:37.581 --> 01:22:40.323
The police are on their way,
you can't get away with this.

01:22:42.456 --> 01:22:44.545
You... you took
everything from me!

01:22:57.427 --> 01:22:58.733
Don't move!

01:22:58.776 --> 01:23:01.170
My baby!

01:23:01.214 --> 01:23:05.957
Everything's going to be okay.

01:23:06.001 --> 01:23:08.873
Don't cry.

01:23:11.093 --> 01:23:13.878
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:23:17.012 --> 01:23:19.014
You're really brave, Jake.

01:23:19.057 --> 01:23:21.973
I'm sorry I got you
involved in all of this.

01:23:22.017 --> 01:23:24.889
It was worth it.

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:34.247
Be careful with him.

01:23:34.290 --> 01:23:37.206
Be careful with my baby!

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:40.253
Take your hands off of me!

01:23:51.002 --> 01:23:52.569
Is he going to be okay?

01:23:52.613 --> 01:23:54.615
Oh yeah, he'll live.

01:23:54.658 --> 01:23:57.400
But he's going
away for a long time.

01:23:57.444 --> 01:24:01.796
Both of them are.

01:24:01.839 --> 01:24:05.234
You know what, I
owe you an apology.

01:24:05.278 --> 01:24:09.673
You were right about your
daughter and I kind of...

01:24:09.717 --> 01:24:13.286
We'll, she's lucky to have you.

01:24:13.329 --> 01:24:18.073
No, I'm lucky to have her.

01:24:18.116 --> 01:24:20.467
Take care.

01:24:22.773 --> 01:24:25.254
Hey, come here.

01:24:28.649 --> 01:24:30.303
Thanks for coming to get me.

01:24:30.346 --> 01:24:32.522
Of course, baby.

01:24:32.566 --> 01:24:35.003
I'll always come for you.

01:24:35.046 --> 01:24:37.266
I know.

01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:42.184
It's on! Mom, come on!

01:24:42.228 --> 01:24:44.969
I'm coming, I'm coming!

01:24:45.013 --> 01:24:46.449
I wonder if they'll
even talk about him.

01:24:46.493 --> 01:24:47.668
I mean, Brad was...

01:24:47.711 --> 01:24:49.191
Shhh!

01:24:49.235 --> 01:24:50.845
After an unplanned hiatus,

01:24:50.888 --> 01:24:52.455
the world's favorite
dating show is finally back.

01:24:52.499 --> 01:24:55.110
Will a hopeless romantic
find his dream girl?

01:24:55.153 --> 01:24:57.330
Or be driven to
the brink of madness

01:24:57.373 --> 01:24:59.810
by the women who turn him down?

01:24:59.854 --> 01:25:02.987
We find out tonight
on Finding Love!

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:05.294
I'm over it.

01:25:05.338 --> 01:25:08.036
You guys wanna
play a board game?

01:25:08.079 --> 01:25:10.430
Board game!

01:25:11.305 --> 01:25:17.661
