00:01.421 --> 00:02.648
Previously on "Rescue Me"...

00:02.768 --> 00:04.113
I think you're drinking too much.

00:04.233 --> 00:05.839
And I think you're drinking
for all the wrong reasons.

00:05.959 --> 00:08.994
Give me another.
I'm learning a valuable lesson.

00:09.062 --> 00:11.263
Pat Mahoney.
What the hell you doing here?

00:11.331 --> 00:12.531
I have cancer?

00:12.599 --> 00:14.900
I'm gonna lie in this room and
nobody's gonna give a shit.

00:14.968 --> 00:17.387
Don't worry about anything, OK?
You're in good hands.

00:17.669 --> 00:18.985
I'mma take care of everything.

00:19.105 --> 00:21.879
The guys in my house wanted me to try
to get information about your cookout.

00:21.999 --> 00:23.498
Yeah, same with the guys in my house.

00:23.618 --> 00:25.911
I thought you might have some answers.

00:25.979 --> 00:29.965
Who is one person that's been there with
you through the thick and the thin?

00:30.883 --> 00:31.783
My wife.

00:31.851 --> 00:33.785
I can tell just looking at
that picture that

00:33.853 --> 00:35.721
that is a woman you don't let slip away.

00:35.788 --> 00:39.420
Maybe that's... what now.

00:39.759 --> 00:40.626
Hey.

00:40.693 --> 00:42.261
You have a clogged pipe.

00:42.328 --> 00:43.862
You know. Drain.

00:43.930 --> 00:45.711
Yeah, so I called him.

00:45.965 --> 00:49.952
You two have got to be shitting me.

00:52.205 --> 00:53.472
Can you come pick me up?

00:53.539 --> 00:55.307
Did Colleen get into that
bottle that we gave you?

00:55.375 --> 00:57.175
Here.
Let me tell you something else.

00:57.243 --> 00:58.681
We laced the bottle.

01:01.868 --> 01:05.083
So, my little girl is out
there sick somewhere.

01:05.150 --> 01:06.718
This is all my fault.

01:06.786 --> 01:08.120
Just find her, Tommy.

01:08.187 --> 01:10.510
I got her! Hey!

01:11.030 --> 01:13.378
Coll, honey?

01:13.660 --> 01:14.848
Hey. Hey.

01:18.564 --> 01:19.364
Hey.

01:19.432 --> 01:20.666
Hey. How you doing?

01:20.733 --> 01:21.681
Good.

01:22.027 --> 01:24.469
Hey, what's the... the new
meeting you're going to?

01:24.537 --> 01:26.291
Brand-new one. Loose.

01:26.798 --> 01:27.981
I think you're gonna like it.

01:28.977 --> 01:31.399
I'll text you the info
and the address later, ok?

01:32.378 --> 01:34.313
Nice to have you back in tow, brother.

01:34.380 --> 01:35.664
Nice being back.

01:37.784 --> 01:39.051
How are you feeling?

01:39.118 --> 01:39.854
Great.

01:40.408 --> 01:41.600
Head's clear as a bell.

01:42.483 --> 01:46.417
Nerves nice and calm and I remember
everything I said and did last night.

01:47.161 --> 01:52.147
Sucks. But guess I gotta get used to it.
The new me.

01:53.273 --> 01:57.469
I'm thinking of taking Colleen to this new
meeting that Mickey's been talking about.

01:57.737 --> 01:58.845
Well, good luck with that.

01:59.484 --> 02:00.686
I just spoke with Sean.

02:01.286 --> 02:03.809
She's staying at his house,
coming home drunk every night.

02:03.876 --> 02:08.258
So it's like, basically, the double
barrel bender thing,

02:08.294 --> 02:09.815
the blackout thing never happened.

02:09.882 --> 02:10.875
Yeah. Apparently not.

02:11.347 --> 02:13.976
I mean, she's young,
dumb, and a Gavin.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.201
Mm-hmm.

02:15.321 --> 02:16.119
Hmm.

02:21.416 --> 02:22.843
Welcome back to sobriety.

02:24.327 --> 02:26.346
I just wish we could say
the same to our daughter.

02:27.745 --> 02:29.487
Maybe when she hits menopause.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074

02:41.862 --> 02:44.101
Franco, get the saw.
We gotta cut the pin.

02:44.137 --> 02:46.859
- Alright.
- Anybody got eyes on a driver?

02:46.979 --> 02:48.495
- She's over there.
- Go, Mike, go.

02:48.540 --> 02:51.262
Hey, probie.
Grab some shears.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.426
Come on! Hurry up!

03:01.701 --> 03:02.934
Hang on a second. Hang on.

03:03.002 --> 03:04.736
Hang on.

03:04.804 --> 03:06.438
Come on. Come on. Come on.

03:06.506 --> 03:07.348
Got her?

03:08.541 --> 03:10.075
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:10.143 --> 03:10.976
Bring her back.

03:11.043 --> 03:12.944
I'm guessing she wasn't
the designated driver.

03:13.012 --> 03:14.012
You know, this is classic.

03:14.080 --> 03:19.783
The drunk ones, they walk away unscathed.
Like goddamn rock 'em sock 'em robots.

03:20.065 --> 03:20.872
Heads up.

03:23.154 --> 03:24.656
Hang on, hang on.

03:24.724 --> 03:27.192
Uhh. Ok. We're good.

03:28.082 --> 03:29.002
Ok.

03:37.057 --> 03:39.444
Hey, Tom. Tom!

03:39.564 --> 03:40.523
What?

03:40.873 --> 03:42.516
- Her neck is broken.
- What?

03:43.202 --> 03:44.169
Tom!

03:46.535 --> 03:48.451
Her neck is broken, Tom.

03:48.981 --> 03:50.115
What?

03:53.219 --> 03:57.088
Hey. Hey, what are you doing
to my sister? Hey! Hey!

03:57.156 --> 03:58.590
You get off of my sister!

03:58.658 --> 04:00.325
I'm gonna kill you.

04:00.393 --> 04:03.892
I'm gonna kill you. Get off of me.
You get off of me.

04:04.316 --> 04:06.364
I have a party to get to.

04:06.432 --> 04:07.599
She's gone, Tom.

04:07.667 --> 04:09.267
Hey, guys, wanna come to the party?

04:09.335 --> 04:11.803
Yeah, yeah.
Where's the party?

04:11.871 --> 04:12.971
You're kind of cute.

04:13.039 --> 04:14.172
Get off of me.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.476
Hey.

04:17.543 --> 04:19.505
So, where's this... where's this party?
Where's this party at?

04:19.625 --> 04:21.579
- Talk to us about the party.
- Right over there.

04:21.647 --> 04:23.348
Yeah? All right.

04:24.113 --> 04:25.684
Don't touch me.

04:27.316 --> 04:30.350
- I'm really... I'm really...
- Thought I had her.

04:31.491 --> 04:32.858
It's over there.

04:32.925 --> 04:34.526
I don't want water.

04:34.594 --> 04:38.857
I have to tell you where the party...

04:39.991 --> 04:42.027
She reminds you of
someone, doesn't she?

04:42.301 --> 04:45.259
- Hey. Hey. Get off of me.
- Yeah.

04:45.771 --> 04:47.441
They both do.

Jeez, Lou, what are you making over there?
The smell alone is giving me a woody.

05:48.690 --> 05:50.803
Well, you know what? That might be the
most disturbing compliment

05:50.871 --> 05:54.649
that I've ever received, but fully
understood and graciously accepted.

05:54.695 --> 05:58.114
I am making chicken cutlets in a white wine,
shallot, and mushroom reduction.

05:58.234 --> 06:01.554
Ooh. I think I just shot a little
mushroom reduction of my own.

06:01.598 --> 06:03.444
Ok, probie, I'm trying to read.
All right?

06:03.477 --> 06:05.178
I don't want to hear about your woody
and your reduction.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.640
You mean more than the usual?

06:06.682 --> 06:08.069
More than the usual?

06:08.189 --> 06:10.677
So, Lou, is this cook-off
ever gonna jump off or what?

06:10.797 --> 06:11.893
Day after tomorrow.

06:11.935 --> 06:14.270
Yeah, the wild men panicked
after they heard we busted Lou

06:14.296 --> 06:19.401
out of the hospital and decided to
postpone a couple days to restrategize.

06:21.009 --> 06:22.058
Say it again.

06:23.820 --> 06:24.736
No.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.639
Didn't think so.

06:26.998 --> 06:29.652
Yeah, so, we found out
that they postponed how?

06:29.772 --> 06:32.314
Our probie found out
from their probie Penny.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.202
He's our inside man.

06:33.322 --> 06:36.836
Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.
So, what's up, probiscus?

06:36.867 --> 06:39.224
What's the 411?
Did you actually get inside

06:39.250 --> 06:40.957
or you still on the outside looking in, huh?

06:41.077 --> 06:44.675
Look. I already feel like a dick
telling you guys about this cook-off shit.

06:44.795 --> 06:48.401
I'm not about to spill the
details of my getting into Penny's pants.

06:50.529 --> 06:51.499
Yeah, outside looking in.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.278
Ha ha.

06:52.398 --> 06:53.936
Thought so.
The first date went to shit?

06:54.056 --> 06:56.587
No. No. All right, here's
what happened, OK?

06:56.615 --> 07:00.029
I took her out for a nice dinner.
We got some beers afterwards.

07:00.149 --> 07:02.132
We're talking, we're laughing,
we're drinking.

07:02.186 --> 07:03.744
I'm getting pretty shitfaced.

07:03.864 --> 07:04.987
I go to the bathroom to take a leak,

07:05.107 --> 07:07.352
come back out and boom, she, uh,

07:07.817 --> 07:09.014
- she ditched me.
- Oh!

07:09.082 --> 07:09.782
Of course she did.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.649
What, did you take your shirt off?
She got a little scared?

07:11.769 --> 07:13.359
Don't underestimate me, Garrity.

07:13.479 --> 07:15.659
- I don't do that.
- Trust me, if I had to take my shirt off

07:15.715 --> 07:18.284
I guarantee I would've sealed
the deal that night.

07:19.046 --> 07:20.170
Chicks dig the white meat.

07:20.290 --> 07:23.419
Oh, my God. Not as much as they
dig the dark meat, brother.

07:24.431 --> 07:25.518
Sorry, Tom.

07:25.638 --> 07:28.541
So, she effectively froze you out.

07:28.661 --> 07:30.582
- Maybe alcohol.
- Maybe alcohol.

07:31.020 --> 07:32.537
Not so fast, assholes.

07:32.657 --> 07:33.466
We're going out again.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.364
Really? You gonna call her
and beg for a second date?

07:35.484 --> 07:37.543
- That's kinda pathetic, bro.
- No, she called me.

07:38.010 --> 07:40.546
Mm. Mysterious woman.
I likes that.

07:40.614 --> 07:43.478
Hey, look. Let's not forget the whole point
of this is that our friend over here

07:43.517 --> 07:47.072
is gonna get us inside information on the
Wild Men's menu, all right?

07:47.104 --> 07:49.974
And I want details.
Look, guys, this cookout's important.

07:49.995 --> 07:52.572
We screw it up, may be the end of this house.
Don't forget that.

07:53.811 --> 07:57.583
Jesus Christ.
I just shit an Inca temple.

07:57.703 --> 07:59.524
- Ha ha!
- I'm cooking here.

07:59.644 --> 08:02.900
The goddamn thing had gold in it.
Here's the best part.

08:03.020 --> 08:04.103
I barely had to wipe.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.622
- That's how perfect it was.
- Wow.

08:06.742 --> 08:08.563
Clean break. One sheet.

08:08.942 --> 08:10.690
Very impressed.

08:10.949 --> 08:11.988
Congratulations.

08:12.108 --> 08:16.047
Thank you.
I just made a great shit comparison.

08:16.167 --> 08:17.583
You're not even gonna
crack a smile for me?

08:18.148 --> 08:19.351
Congratulations.

08:21.395 --> 08:24.128
All right. She's not the first
kid we lost, Tom.

08:24.248 --> 08:25.960
She's not gonna be the last, either.

08:26.317 --> 08:27.697
We can't save everyone.

08:27.984 --> 08:29.091
No, we can't.

08:30.758 --> 08:32.131
Let's go.

08:39.851 --> 08:40.890
My reduction.

08:41.010 --> 08:44.279
Don't worry about your reduction.
It's gonna be fine.

08:52.446 --> 08:53.813
Tommy. Let's go.

09:09.065 --> 09:12.741
All right. She reminds you of your
daughter. I get it, OK, Tommy?

09:12.861 --> 09:16.177
God forbid Colleen ever puts her
or her sister in that situation

09:16.297 --> 09:18.705
but this is here and this is now.
We'll deal with that later.

09:21.138 --> 09:22.231
Come on.

09:33.395 --> 09:38.063
Remember Johnny Panface,
Brooklyn 68 truck?

09:38.562 --> 09:40.202
Yeah. Half-Irish, half-Asian.

09:40.322 --> 09:42.184
He liked to get drunk
and kick shit. So?

09:44.367 --> 09:47.073
Two kids died on him one day on a call.

09:47.359 --> 09:50.670
You probably remember this story.
And he...

09:52.337 --> 09:53.936
Got back to the firehouse and he...

09:54.920 --> 09:57.825
He peeled off and he walked away.
I think...

09:58.290 --> 09:59.615
I think he became a teacher.

09:59.861 --> 10:02.472
Yeah, well, you ain't
no teacher, Tommy.

10:03.166 --> 10:04.260
Come on.

10:05.093 --> 10:08.686
I used to... I used to think
that he was nuts. I mean, we all did, right?

10:11.765 --> 10:13.059
I'm...

10:16.382 --> 10:18.580
I'm starting to think maybe
I'm... maybe... maybe...

10:19.553 --> 10:20.846
I don't know.

10:26.819 --> 10:28.897
I tell you, Needs...

10:30.031 --> 10:31.357
Girl today...

10:32.354 --> 10:33.284
Uh...

10:34.241 --> 10:35.047
Hit me.

10:45.009 --> 10:47.606
It's like I'm stuck in cement
over here, man. I can't...

10:47.726 --> 10:51.341
See, that's because there's
no alcohol in your system, Tommy.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.039
Just get up.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.458
I ain't gettin' up.

10:56.709 --> 10:59.007
Yo, come on. We got a call.
What are you guys doing?

10:59.127 --> 10:59.991
Get on the rig.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.810
Go get on the rig.

11:06.097 --> 11:07.245
You, too.

11:09.555 --> 11:10.649
All right, look.

11:12.097 --> 11:13.396
We'll talk about it, all right?

11:13.648 --> 11:15.465
When I get back, we'll talk all about it.

11:15.889 --> 11:16.917
Talk about this.

11:17.037 --> 11:18.564
We'll talk about your daughters.

11:19.477 --> 11:21.800
But right now, Tommy, your daughters ain't
gettin' on that truck

11:21.868 --> 11:25.665
and heading into a possible
life-and-death situation. You know who is?

11:26.929 --> 11:28.373
Your nephew, Tommy.

11:29.241 --> 11:31.113
And the rest of your crew.

11:39.504 --> 11:42.538
All right. You stay here.

11:44.206 --> 11:46.570
And if you see your
balls, pick 'em up.

11:46.591 --> 11:48.538
When I get back,
I'll staple them back on you.

11:48.782 --> 11:49.873
Chicken shit,

12:06.010 --> 12:08.514
62 truck, cancel that call.
1281 Amsterdam.

12:08.581 --> 12:09.548
False alarm.

12:09.616 --> 12:10.999
Copy.

12:13.253 --> 12:14.553
What the hell was that?

12:15.028 --> 12:17.037
Might've lost a wheel.
I better check.

12:20.822 --> 12:22.294
Hey, what's going on?

12:22.856 --> 12:24.031
Flat tire.

12:25.335 --> 12:26.962
What do we got here?

12:28.234 --> 12:31.336
Oh, boy. Nielsie. Oh, shit.

12:32.363 --> 12:36.347
You know, I would try mouth-to-mouth,
but I only do that with live pussy.

12:36.467 --> 12:37.344
Not that I remember.

12:37.539 --> 12:38.636
Don't worry about it, Niels.

12:39.538 --> 12:40.768
I didn't even see her.

12:40.888 --> 12:43.715
Too bad Tommy isn't here to see this.
He hates cats.

12:44.255 --> 12:45.923
Probably put you up
for a medal, Niels.

12:46.043 --> 12:48.114
Yeah, if he's not on his
way to knitting class.

12:48.811 --> 12:49.922
What is that supposed to mean?

12:50.369 --> 12:51.223
What do you think?

12:52.237 --> 12:53.754
He got a little rattled, that's all.

12:53.874 --> 12:54.765
Yeah, well, you know what, Dame?

12:54.792 --> 12:56.706
A lot of guys get a little rattled
and they never recover.

12:56.826 --> 12:58.264
Spend the rest of their
lives like cowards.

13:00.671 --> 13:02.844
Whoa.
Who you are calling a coward?

13:03.159 --> 13:04.594
I think I was pretty
clear the first time.

13:04.714 --> 13:06.817
No. No. You got some balls, Franco.

13:07.172 --> 13:09.796
You're the one trying to get
with my man's wife behind his back.

13:10.901 --> 13:13.839
You want to see a coward, try
looking in the mirror, slick.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.420
All right, bro. You know, if that were
true, that would make me an asshole,

13:16.476 --> 13:17.361
not a coward.

13:17.417 --> 13:18.422
Be an asshole and a coward.

13:18.453 --> 13:19.609
Look, I wasn't trying to get with her.

13:19.649 --> 13:20.871
Oh, bullshit. Just stop it.

13:20.991 --> 13:22.148
You've been over there all the time.

13:22.161 --> 13:23.604
When he's not there, there you are.

13:23.781 --> 13:26.041
Prowling around his
house and shit, Franco? Come on.

13:26.083 --> 13:26.790
All right, well, you know what?

13:26.815 --> 13:29.187
Maybe if he was taking care of his own
business, she wouldn't have be calling on me.

13:29.215 --> 13:31.314
Whoa, whoa. So now you gonna
place some blame on her.

13:31.434 --> 13:33.727
I mean, that sound like some
coward-ass shit to me, son.

13:33.791 --> 13:36.369
Yo, why don't you just step up and
take some responsibility, punk?

13:36.468 --> 13:37.118
All right, you know what?

13:37.140 --> 13:39.779
I'll be stepping up, but I'll be
stepping up your ass with my size 13s.

13:39.815 --> 13:42.214
Yeah. You want to talk about
stepping up and taking responsibility?

13:42.245 --> 13:43.566
What about your drunk-ass girlfriend?

13:43.686 --> 13:45.526
How come you ain't keeping
that pussy in line, bitch?

13:46.252 --> 13:46.948
Come on, come on, come on.

13:46.979 --> 13:49.745
You want to fight?
We can fight, man. What's up?

13:49.865 --> 13:52.971
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Let them fight.

13:53.091 --> 13:54.588
- What?
- There's nobody around.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.821
This animosity has been building
between these two.

13:56.889 --> 13:59.806
We don't stop it now, it's gonna fester, it's
gonna spread through the whole house.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.924
We got enough of that shit
going on right now.

14:02.044 --> 14:03.263
So, we fight.
But listen.

14:03.383 --> 14:05.573
- When the fight is over, the argument
is over, understood? - Done.

14:05.624 --> 14:07.519
All right. Let's stop talking shit
and let's go.

14:08.503 --> 14:11.057
Don't go getting all spic
on me and pull out a knife.

14:11.177 --> 14:13.176
Yeah? Don't get all black
on me and pull out a gun.

14:16.588 --> 14:19.335
What's up? Come on. Come on.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.859
Oh, my God. Gumball.

14:34.927 --> 14:36.294
That's my cat.

14:36.362 --> 14:38.463
Oh, no. Please. That's my cat.

14:46.762 --> 14:49.236
All right, hey, folks,
there's nothing to see here.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.502
Just a couple of West Side Wild Men
blowing off a little steam,

14:52.533 --> 14:54.149
so, go back to your houses.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.314
Everything's... Oh, shit.

14:58.002 --> 14:59.246
The men in blue.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.144
You know, guys, don't even
get out of the car. It's all right.

15:03.264 --> 15:04.921
- It was just a little...
- Break this up. Come on.

15:04.966 --> 15:06.057
House fracas going on.

15:06.177 --> 15:06.925
Nothing to worry about.

15:06.992 --> 15:08.218
This ain't in house.

15:08.338 --> 15:09.360
Step aside, fatty.

15:09.428 --> 15:10.795
These are our guys.

15:10.863 --> 15:12.463
You guys are out of line here.
Come on. Come on.

15:12.531 --> 15:14.332
- It's like a family thing.
- You guys are out of line.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.435
You're not gonna get around me.
Ain't gonna get around me.

15:20.116 --> 15:21.420
That's enough!

15:22.510 --> 15:24.819
Frankie, break these assholes up.

15:26.295 --> 15:27.812
All right, knock it off.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.047
Knock it off.

15:29.114 --> 15:31.039
That's enough. Enough. Enough.

15:31.159 --> 15:32.969
- Come on, break it up.
- He started it.

15:33.089 --> 15:35.864
Walk away. Walk away.

15:35.984 --> 15:37.709
Come on, Lou.

15:37.996 --> 15:39.985
Ah, look. Nobody needs the paperwork.

15:40.018 --> 15:42.139
I know I don't. Let's walk away.
This never happened.

15:42.259 --> 15:44.566
All right? Let's forget this happened.
You go back to your house.

15:44.593 --> 15:47.531
We'll take care of this. Everything'll
be fine. Thank you, gentlemen.

15:47.651 --> 15:49.133
Thank you very much.

15:49.201 --> 15:50.397
Jerk-off.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.002
Nielsie.

15:53.973 --> 15:55.321
I murdered Gumball.

15:55.441 --> 15:59.530
No... Listen, Gavin
isn't even in the mix.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.314
See? I guess Tommy's not the
cause of all your problems.

16:03.382 --> 16:05.374
Go back to the rig and get the med kit.

16:06.071 --> 16:09.160
Put Nielsie in there. Nobody wants
to see a goddamn Redwood cry.

16:09.597 --> 16:11.482
- Move.
- Niels, get on the rig.

16:11.602 --> 16:13.024
All this before lunch?

16:13.092 --> 16:16.838
Wasn't my fault. I just want to go on record.
I did nothing but help break it up.

16:23.037 --> 16:24.237
So, you're not afraid.

16:24.305 --> 16:25.505
No.

16:25.573 --> 16:27.574
You're just...
Done.

16:27.642 --> 16:28.616
Done. Right.

16:29.545 --> 16:32.323
I know you can't drink anymore,
but I sure as hell can.

16:36.684 --> 16:38.405
I think you are afraid.

16:41.589 --> 16:42.969
I think...

16:46.304 --> 16:47.561
Are you ready for this?

16:49.530 --> 16:50.973
I think you're a coward.

16:57.985 --> 17:00.473
- Take it back.
- It's true.

17:05.646 --> 17:09.473
If you didn't have that baseball bat
leaning against that wall next to you...

17:10.417 --> 17:14.345
I'd hit you so hard, you'd be shitting
teeth for the next 10 days. Take it back.

17:21.195 --> 17:22.781
Take your best shot.

17:24.565 --> 17:25.651
Sinner.

17:27.001 --> 17:28.117
Demon.

17:30.367 --> 17:31.638
Chickenshit.

17:35.205 --> 17:38.311
Not afraid to hit a priest. I got a cousin
who's a priest. Used to be a priest.

17:38.379 --> 17:40.932
Hit him many, many times, even
when he was wearing the collar.

17:40.979 --> 17:41.889
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.783
Yeah, well, you would've swung
already if you didn't know

17:43.851 --> 17:46.073
inside that dick mick head
of yours that I'm right.

17:47.188 --> 17:48.779
I'm right as goddamn rain.

17:50.991 --> 17:51.963
Coward.

17:54.862 --> 17:56.314
You ain't afraid of fire.

17:58.899 --> 18:01.858
Ain't afraid of running in there and
staying in there longer than anybody else.

18:01.894 --> 18:03.846
I've seen that with my own two eyes.

18:05.239 --> 18:10.267
No. As far as fire's concerned, you
got a pair of titanium testicles.

18:14.515 --> 18:20.454
So... it's gotta be something
else that's stuck in your throat,

18:20.755 --> 18:22.135
instead of your balls.

18:22.456 --> 18:23.805
And let me guess.

18:26.727 --> 18:30.813
Karma. I got you nailed
down on this one, I think.

18:32.233 --> 18:33.205
How's that?

18:33.601 --> 18:38.836
You feel like the nasty-ass,
lousy behavior you indulged in,

18:38.956 --> 18:44.165
especially since 9/11... the sex,
the booze, the egotistical stuff...

18:45.026 --> 18:47.747
It somehow gets all
balanced out by what you do...

18:47.815 --> 18:50.537
Saving kids. People.
Pulling people back from the brink.

18:50.657 --> 18:53.887
But if these kids, if these
people do not cooperate with you,

18:54.201 --> 18:57.571
if they die and they stay dead...

18:59.060 --> 19:03.886
No matter what kind of magic you try
and work, the scores don't add up.

19:04.598 --> 19:07.599
The bad karma gets the upper
hand on the good karma.

19:08.536 --> 19:09.471
You're screwed.

19:10.137 --> 19:12.073
The people you're supposed to rescue?

19:12.757 --> 19:14.096
They don't do what you want.

19:14.684 --> 19:15.763
Colleen...

19:16.228 --> 19:17.773
doesn't do what you want...

19:18.415 --> 19:19.903
So you know what you do?

19:20.387 --> 19:22.819
You quit.
You take the coward's way.

19:23.366 --> 19:24.241
You quit.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.439
Suck it up, brother.

19:28.189 --> 19:31.057
Here's a headline for you...
you ain't Jesus.

19:31.508 --> 19:35.420
So just get back on that bus. Go to work.

19:35.896 --> 19:39.454
Some people die sober.
Some drunks...

19:40.082 --> 19:42.676
They won't die. Who knows why?

19:45.372 --> 19:47.627
No. You know what I believe in?

19:48.108 --> 19:49.089
What?

19:50.611 --> 19:52.216
I believe in karma.

19:53.180 --> 19:55.748
I believe in good deeds done.

19:55.816 --> 19:58.037
What else do we have on this earth?

19:59.527 --> 20:00.538
You...

20:02.123 --> 20:03.272
do what you can.

20:03.524 --> 20:06.887
Be a man. Jump off that rig,
run into the fire,

20:07.394 --> 20:09.285
and breathe life back
into a dead baby.

20:09.324 --> 20:11.762
Pull a senior citizen back out
into light of day.

20:11.801 --> 20:14.166
That is legal tender come judgment day.

20:15.069 --> 20:16.723
If you believe in judgment day.

20:19.073 --> 20:21.744
You really don't... you don't...

20:22.933 --> 20:25.763
Believe in any of the traditional catholic

20:26.214 --> 20:30.323
heaven and hell and any of that stuff
that's in the bible.

20:31.085 --> 20:31.924
Nope.

20:32.586 --> 20:36.267
I run a practical parish, thus, the baseball
bat, the booze.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.302
No hell, no heaven.

20:44.231 --> 20:45.356
All right.

20:47.234 --> 20:49.002
This is like... this is good.

20:49.069 --> 20:51.583
This is like... you're like one of them

20:52.348 --> 20:54.755
guys the Jewish guys go and talk to.

20:54.875 --> 20:55.621
Rabbi?

20:55.741 --> 20:59.475
No. Shrink. It's like when
Jewish guys talk to a shrink.

20:59.595 --> 21:01.763
This is... like it. This is good.

21:02.983 --> 21:05.410
- Anytime. You know where to find me.
- Thanks, padre.

21:10.672 --> 21:13.146
- Ah, what'd I tell you?
- Always dreamed of this.

21:13.266 --> 21:15.261
- Ha ha ha.
- The ballet. Wow.

21:16.097 --> 21:19.433
Hey, I was stationed at a house
in this neighborhood about 15 years ago.

21:19.553 --> 21:21.534
Always used to
drive by this place at night

21:21.602 --> 21:23.041
going out to calls.

21:24.558 --> 21:27.604
But this is the first time I ever been a part of it. Man.

21:28.159 --> 21:30.966
A night at the ballet.

21:31.493 --> 21:32.504
A dream come true.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.111
Yeah, what the hell ***
in the ballet in the first place?

21:35.231 --> 21:36.816
Yeah. You used to be, like,
a dancer or something?

21:36.884 --> 21:41.487
No. No. I always wanted to have sex with a
chick who could brush her hair with her feet.

21:41.555 --> 21:42.815
Oh. Who doesn't?

21:42.935 --> 21:44.557
Hey. I want you guys to know.

21:44.625 --> 21:47.575
State I'm in, a lot of clear
thoughts bounce around my head.

21:47.603 --> 21:49.228
Feel like I oughta let you
know a couple of them.

21:49.296 --> 21:49.912
Ok.

21:50.032 --> 21:53.132
Now that I'm facing the end,
I got a couple of regrets.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.035
Yeah, I'll bet. Like cleaning up
down at ground zero all that time?

21:56.103 --> 21:56.869
No.

21:56.937 --> 22:00.125
Even though, like, it might be the
reason, you know...

22:00.245 --> 22:01.607
- What? I'm dying?
- Hey.

22:01.675 --> 22:03.209
No, no. No. It's OK, Sammy.

22:03.277 --> 22:07.727
These regrets are more... profound.

22:08.205 --> 22:09.421
You know, like...

22:10.242 --> 22:12.418
I always wanted to punch Dr. Phil in the face.

22:12.486 --> 22:13.720
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

22:13.787 --> 22:16.122
- And Regis.
- Oh. He bugs me.

22:16.190 --> 22:18.057
Yeah.
Kids.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.660
You want to punch kids?

22:20.728 --> 22:22.173
Ooh, like that kid from "The Sixth Sense"?

22:22.209 --> 22:23.409
I always wanted to punch him
right in the face.

22:23.482 --> 22:25.231
No. No.
I don't want to punch any kids.

22:25.299 --> 22:27.233
How about that little shit
from "Jerry Maguire"? God.

22:27.301 --> 22:30.150
Ok, maybe I'd punch him but really,
I just...

22:30.751 --> 22:32.920
...regret not having any.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.707
Oh. That's it?

22:34.775 --> 22:39.045
Yeah. But hey, let's get rid
of this downer shit. This...

22:39.113 --> 22:42.224
Seeing the ballet, this is gonna
overcome a lot of regrets.

22:42.344 --> 22:45.251
I mean, maybe not the kid thing,
but definitely the...

22:45.319 --> 22:48.187
bopping famous assholes in the face thing.
I mean, see,

22:48.255 --> 22:50.490
I was always afraid to come here with other
firemen because

22:50.557 --> 22:53.914
I figured they'd just, you know,
be so bored they'd fall asleep...

22:54.034 --> 22:55.308
Or break my balls about it.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.511
Hey, not a chance this time, pal.
We are looking forward to it.

22:57.631 --> 23:00.772
Ooh. Hot dancer chicks in leotards?
Any guy who slept through that

23:00.814 --> 23:02.255
would have to be gay, right?

23:02.297 --> 23:03.498
You've got that right, bro.

23:03.540 --> 23:06.051
Gentlemen, the ballet awaits.

23:11.074 --> 23:13.775
So, you said Teddy was coming.

23:13.843 --> 23:15.760
He's supposed to be.

23:15.880 --> 23:17.113
I think he's running a little late.

23:21.648 --> 23:24.953
Hi. I'm Maggie and
I'm an alcoholic.

23:25.021 --> 23:26.955
Hi, Maggie.

23:27.023 --> 23:31.377
Hi. And when I say alcoholic,
I mean like a gimungous alcoholic.

23:31.705 --> 23:35.670
We're talking, like, Babe Ruth-style
drinking records that may never be broken.

23:35.932 --> 23:37.599
What? It's anonymous.

23:37.667 --> 23:40.167
Technically, I'm not even
supposed to say she's here.

23:41.275 --> 23:42.604
Technically?

23:42.672 --> 23:45.947
...All in one night, and not
only did I not puke, I met a

23:46.370 --> 23:48.939
cute guy, we went out dancing, and

23:49.059 --> 23:53.613
we went back to my pad and banged
each other until 8 A.M. the next day.

23:54.009 --> 23:55.283
All without blow.

23:59.422 --> 24:00.808
But that might have been at his place.

24:00.928 --> 24:05.523
Is there anyone coming back or just
new from a relapse that'd like to say hi?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.154
Tommy?

24:08.234 --> 24:10.287
Yeah. That's my... my...

24:10.407 --> 24:12.799
Yeah. He's the one I was telling
you about here last week.

24:12.819 --> 24:14.890
My brother Tommy. He is a raging alcoholic.

24:14.923 --> 24:16.905
He makes me look like
Shirley goddamn Temple.

24:18.507 --> 24:22.043
- Um, Mickey. I'm an alcoholic, everybody.
Not for nothing... - Hi, Mickey.

24:22.111 --> 24:26.914
Hi, everybody. Even though he is a raging
bull of a boozehound, you know, he's back.

24:30.419 --> 24:32.187
I'll give him that.

24:32.254 --> 24:35.557
Mickey's right, and he's not the only one
coming back tonight. Is he, Uncle Teddy?

24:35.625 --> 24:39.687
You wanted to go with your Uncle Teddy.
This is a real special place. Come on.

24:39.807 --> 24:41.563
Nice, big hall.
We're gonna have a ball.

24:41.631 --> 24:42.964
Is that aunt Maggie?

24:43.032 --> 24:46.201
I didn't know you were drinking again.

24:46.268 --> 24:48.036
Do you
think she [indistinct]?

24:48.104 --> 24:49.638
Why don't you sit yourself
down right over here?

24:49.705 --> 24:50.538
Why?

24:50.606 --> 24:52.030
Yeah. You'll be good.

24:53.275 --> 24:56.065
Dad? Ok, wait a minute.

24:56.185 --> 24:58.940
Uncle... no.
This is a goddamn AA meeting?

24:59.060 --> 25:00.490
Sit down and shut up.

25:00.610 --> 25:03.054
It's only gonna take a minute or two.
Maybe 3.

25:03.546 --> 25:05.569
Hi, everybody! How's it hanging?

25:08.190 --> 25:12.244
Well, well, well, if this
doesn't suck my sack.

25:12.595 --> 25:14.191
Why don't you introduce yourself?

25:14.597 --> 25:15.971
Oh. Yeah. Right.

25:16.381 --> 25:20.177
Hi. My name is Teddy Gavin,
and not only am I an alcoholic,

25:20.436 --> 25:24.072
but I also got a glass of whiskey
right here in my goddamn hand.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.940
Hi, Teddy.

25:26.008 --> 25:28.874
And this here's Colleen, my niece,

25:28.994 --> 25:30.569
who's also an alcoholic

25:30.689 --> 25:33.963
but is not really up to admitting it
and owning up to it right now.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.583
Hi, Colleen.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.322
Whoa.

25:41.390 --> 25:45.389
That, my fellow juiceheads, is the
last drink I shall ever draw.

25:46.095 --> 25:49.668
I gave up my... sobriety a few
weeks back,

25:50.420 --> 25:51.790
and I'll tell you why.

25:52.146 --> 25:56.068
Because I wanted this chick
right here, who swore to her dad

25:56.188 --> 26:00.323
that she was just gonna drink wine
instead of giving up booze altogether.

26:01.252 --> 26:04.343
I wanted to compress
what may have taken two decades

26:04.463 --> 26:08.950
to flourish into a big drinking problem
and I have it all happen in two weeks.

26:10.052 --> 26:13.088
Speaking of owning up, I've
been taking her everywhere.

26:13.155 --> 26:18.093
To every dive bar, every scumbag-filled,
whore-packed joint in the city,

26:18.160 --> 26:20.261
and it still ain't makin' a dent.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.030
Well, who do we have
to blame for that?

26:22.098 --> 26:22.964
Let him talk. Let him talk.

26:23.032 --> 26:25.289
It's your fault. The both of you.
You're both complicit.

26:25.409 --> 26:29.645
You... you put that bottle in my hand, OK?
She could've died, for chrissakes.

26:29.765 --> 26:31.272
- I was trying to help her.
- Oh, really!

26:31.340 --> 26:33.441
You put some GHB in a
high-end bottle of whiskey?

26:33.509 --> 26:34.242
What'd you say?

26:34.310 --> 26:36.811
Just enough to mess them up a little bit.

26:36.879 --> 26:38.762
Just sort of like liquid roofies, you know?

26:38.882 --> 26:41.516
And not only does he take her out
on a bender with him,

26:41.584 --> 26:43.618
but he leaves her on a beach drunk.

26:43.738 --> 26:45.682
And now she won't even stop.

26:45.802 --> 26:47.393
Ok. That's not my fault.

26:47.421 --> 26:50.250
You guys put liquid roofies into the whiskey
bottle, and you're trying to blame me?

26:50.370 --> 26:51.986
I thought I was doing the right thing.

26:52.106 --> 26:53.962
- What do you mean?
- Shut up. Maggie, this is private.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.772
Why don't you come here
and make me, Tommy?

26:55.814 --> 26:57.242
That's why we're here.

26:57.362 --> 26:59.724
Don't you go anywhere.

26:59.844 --> 27:02.203
Get back here. Listen, you talk about
it right in here.

27:02.271 --> 27:03.872
- Shut up.
- No, I'm not gonna shut up.

27:03.939 --> 27:08.243
Hey, hey, you two break it
up for God's sake. Stop!

27:20.661 --> 27:22.165
Maple syrup.

27:30.966 --> 27:33.434
Shh.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.811
So, what's the deal with your uncle?
Are they gonna shitcan him?

27:42.111 --> 27:43.487
Tommy? No.

27:43.946 --> 27:46.001
No, him and Needles go way back.

27:46.348 --> 27:48.267
Plus, the department's tried to kick him out,
 like,

27:48.288 --> 27:49.948
a thousand times before
and it's never worked.

27:52.254 --> 27:54.021
Thank you.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.823
So, what do you think happened to him?

27:58.154 --> 27:59.507
I think he got scared.

28:01.397 --> 28:02.520
That surprise you?

28:03.165 --> 28:04.196
No.

28:04.667 --> 28:05.733
I think he's scared.

28:05.801 --> 28:07.238
I think we're all scared.

28:07.870 --> 28:08.803
Aren't you?

28:08.871 --> 28:11.072
Come on.

28:15.244 --> 28:16.695
Yeah, I'm scared.

28:17.913 --> 28:19.401
Me, too.

28:20.749 --> 28:22.923
Yeah, you mentioned that already.

28:24.481 --> 28:26.996
Mention it again and I
might not sleep with you.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.726
Mention what again?

28:30.726 --> 28:33.284
- That was great.
- I feel so rested.

28:33.404 --> 28:34.729
Those seats were the real deal.

28:34.797 --> 28:36.049
Weren't they, though?
So plush.

28:36.169 --> 28:37.832
- So soft, bro.
- Aah!

28:37.900 --> 28:39.105
Jesus Christ.

28:39.668 --> 28:41.302
- What, did he see something?
- Aah!

28:41.370 --> 28:42.904
Jeez. Come on. Pat.
You all right?

28:42.972 --> 28:44.505
- I don't wanna die.
- Ok.

28:44.573 --> 28:47.175
- Goddamn it, I don't want to die.
- Ok.

28:47.243 --> 28:48.877
Then what'd I do it all for?

28:49.274 --> 28:51.926
I mean, helping dig them guys
out, doing the right thing, for what?

28:52.377 --> 28:54.249
For 40 grand a year?

28:54.369 --> 28:57.007
Nobody's gonna remember me, what
I done down there, not the way...

28:57.127 --> 29:00.255
Not the way they're gonna remember what
that ballerina did in there tonight.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.261
That's true. My God, did you
see that thing she did, like,

29:02.381 --> 29:04.366
the pretzel move with her leg, like, up
behind her...

29:04.858 --> 29:06.694
You were asleep already?
Bro, that was 5 minutes in.

29:06.762 --> 29:09.501
Dude, I told you to wake me
for any hot stuff, dude.

29:09.621 --> 29:10.732
You did not.

29:10.799 --> 29:11.982
Shit. I must've dreamt that.

29:12.102 --> 29:14.802
But I did see, like, the whole clenched ass
thing toward the end with the walnuts.

29:14.870 --> 29:16.826
The walnuts?
Why didn't you wake me for that?

29:16.946 --> 29:18.576
Oh, wait. Sorry, dude.

29:18.696 --> 29:20.575
False alarm.
I must've dreamt that, too.

29:20.643 --> 29:22.973
Great. Holy shit.
Pat, what are you doing, man?

29:23.093 --> 29:25.647
I am gonna piss in this fountain.

29:25.714 --> 29:28.182
I asked if you had to go
when were still inside.

29:28.250 --> 29:31.019
Uhh. That ballerina.
When I looked at her,

29:31.086 --> 29:35.189
I thought to myself, what power,
what beauty, what grace.

29:35.257 --> 29:36.090
Ok.

29:36.158 --> 29:37.775
Wouldn't I like to nail that?

29:37.895 --> 29:39.812
- yeah.
- Only I can't.

29:40.372 --> 29:42.545
All that chemo gave me dysfunctional junk.

29:42.932 --> 29:47.023
I'm only a shadow of the man I used to be.
I am an impotent,

29:47.143 --> 29:50.290
cancer-ridden,
no-ballerina-banging loser.

29:50.410 --> 29:55.061
And if that is what my life is gonna be,
I am gonna piss in this goddamn fountain.

29:55.911 --> 29:57.245
Listen. Hey. Come here.

29:57.313 --> 29:59.235
Uh-oh. Come here. Hey. Come here.
Sit down. Turn around.

29:59.355 --> 30:00.656
You all right? Take a load off.

30:00.776 --> 30:02.684
- Jesus. You OK?
- I'm good.

30:02.751 --> 30:04.152
Breathe deep.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.487
All right. You know what
we're gonna do for you?

30:06.555 --> 30:08.556
We're gonna piss in the fountain.
Come on.

30:08.624 --> 30:10.513
I don't have to go, dude.

30:10.633 --> 30:11.659
Yeah, neither do I. Shit.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.528
Well, let's go get some
beers and we'll come back.

30:26.782 --> 30:31.262
You know, I don't care who it is or what
they have to say. I ain't quitting.

30:32.246 --> 30:36.159
All right. Just do me the favor of listening
to this person, OK? Doesn't work,

30:36.227 --> 30:39.229
I wash my hands and you can go
on and do whatever you want.

30:39.296 --> 30:44.554
You just woke up, you know, from an
alcohol-induced coma on a beach.

30:44.674 --> 30:46.851
You could've drowned.

30:48.416 --> 30:51.641
They just said it was a laced bottle.
It wasn't regular booze.

30:51.709 --> 30:55.983
I drank a whole bottle of whiskey and
never even came close to blacking out.

30:57.514 --> 30:59.223
And you don't think
you have a problem.

30:59.717 --> 31:00.776
You do it all the time.

31:02.183 --> 31:05.108
You know, my only problem
right now is you.

31:06.682 --> 31:07.898
And mom.

31:08.622 --> 31:09.579
And money.

31:15.333 --> 31:16.591
How often do you drink?

31:18.035 --> 31:19.557
You know, whenever.

31:23.663 --> 31:24.797
So whenever.

31:25.995 --> 31:27.799
Whenever I'm awake.

31:29.647 --> 31:31.202
Do you drink to forget?

31:31.582 --> 31:33.006
You bet your ass.

31:33.251 --> 31:34.809
What is it you're trying to forget?

31:35.834 --> 31:36.968
Everything.

32:04.364 --> 32:05.525
Go ahead.

32:07.821 --> 32:09.489
Sorry. No ice.

32:10.932 --> 32:11.902
Drink.

32:14.759 --> 32:17.307
She's gonna want to forget
what I'm about to say next.

32:19.341 --> 32:21.774
The booze isn't the answer
you need, sweetheart.

32:24.207 --> 32:25.860
Booze is a dead end.

32:27.037 --> 32:28.430
You drink to forget... good.

32:29.073 --> 32:30.994
You want to drink to forget... good.

32:32.762 --> 32:36.112
But what it is you're trying
to forget is gonna be staring

32:36.180 --> 32:39.284
right back at you whenever
you decide to sober up.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.518
Thou shall not kill.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.753
Thou shall not lie.

32:43.821 --> 32:46.422
Honor thy father and thy mother.

32:46.490 --> 32:48.258
No sex before marriage.

32:48.325 --> 32:50.727
No jealousy. No cursing.

32:50.794 --> 32:53.630
Shit, how about you say "no fun"?

32:53.697 --> 32:54.998
Because that's what my life is.

32:55.065 --> 32:56.413
It's no fun.

32:57.847 --> 32:59.610
Unless I'm drinking.

33:00.037 --> 33:05.618
When I'm sober, I am just waiting for the
news that my father got burned up

33:05.653 --> 33:10.266
or shot dead or is leaving my mom again
or sleeping with my aunt.

33:10.386 --> 33:14.408
You don't have enough
commandments for him to break.

33:15.419 --> 33:19.079
You know, when I am sober, I am
fighting with my boyfriend or

33:19.199 --> 33:22.906
hating my sister or watching the
time crawl by on the wall clock

33:23.026 --> 33:25.791
at work, wishing that I was
anywhere else.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.141
But when I am drunk,

33:28.824 --> 33:30.888
my dad's the best dad in the world.

33:31.694 --> 33:34.540
Work's just great, my sister's an angel,

33:34.660 --> 33:37.177
and my mom's my best friend.

33:37.297 --> 33:39.422
So, I ain't quittin'.

33:39.887 --> 33:41.568
This bullshit...

33:42.032 --> 33:44.315
You, Jesus, God...

33:44.547 --> 33:46.493
None of this shit ever did me any good.

33:47.586 --> 33:48.680
Until tonight.

33:48.939 --> 33:52.055
Because tonight, I've had
a couple free drinks.

33:53.097 --> 33:56.092
So, I say amen to that.

33:59.925 --> 34:01.319
So long, father.

34:01.552 --> 34:03.055
See you in hell, dad.

34:09.271 --> 34:11.853
You know, we only perform exorcism usually on

34:12.960 --> 34:14.478
one person at a time.

34:16.447 --> 34:17.498
But I think

34:19.002 --> 34:22.527
for the Gavin family,
I'll have to give you a group rate.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.958
I'm sorry, Tom. I have to go now.
I have to get back to the rectory.

34:35.895 --> 34:37.152
Thanks.

34:50.047 --> 34:52.574
Colleen. Hey.

34:52.844 --> 34:53.760
What?

34:53.880 --> 34:55.195
I got your bag.

34:58.092 --> 34:59.172
How you getting home?

35:00.124 --> 35:03.311
I texted Sean while your priest
friend was mouthing off.

35:20.182 --> 35:24.582
Did you know that you...
You were never baptized?

35:25.443 --> 35:26.703
Little-known fact.

35:27.482 --> 35:30.953
When you were born,
you ingested some fluids

35:32.449 --> 35:34.717
and you got an infection.

35:36.424 --> 35:41.371
So, they had you in the hospital
hooked up to a couple of machines

35:42.574 --> 35:43.688
for about a month.

35:44.549 --> 35:46.236
The idea of

35:47.261 --> 35:49.050
bringing you into an environment like this

35:49.095 --> 35:53.135
so you could be surrounded by strangers and
have your head dunked underwater was...

35:56.049 --> 36:01.584
No, neither one of us had ever known any
kid that had been baptized who didn't cry.

36:03.153 --> 36:08.072
We decided to have Uncle Mick come over
to the apartment and he did the honors.

36:08.770 --> 36:17.090
Little official, unofficial thing,
but done deal nonetheless.

36:19.517 --> 36:20.952
Boo hoo.

36:25.863 --> 36:29.444
God! Jesus! dad!
What the hell are you doing?

36:29.936 --> 36:31.314
For your own good.

36:31.381 --> 36:33.583
No. Goddamnit. No!

36:33.650 --> 36:38.087
- God... Damn...
- Listen. Stop it.

36:38.155 --> 36:41.624
Dad! What are you doing?

36:41.692 --> 36:44.575
Dad! Goddamn it.

36:44.695 --> 36:45.528
- Stop it.
- Dad!

36:45.596 --> 36:47.230
- Stop it.
- Dad, let go of me.

36:47.631 --> 36:49.332
Dad!

36:49.399 --> 36:51.200
Stop. Stop.

36:51.268 --> 36:52.801
- Dad.
- Dammit.

36:53.337 --> 36:55.319
What are you doing?

36:55.439 --> 36:56.772
Dad!

36:56.840 --> 36:58.803
Mom is gonna be so pissed!

36:59.576 --> 37:01.463
Mom's gonna be so... goddamnit!

37:02.570 --> 37:04.180
Dad!

37:04.248 --> 37:06.215
Dad, where the hell are you?

37:06.283 --> 37:08.060
Why are you doing this to me?

37:08.785 --> 37:11.354
Dad! Get me out of this!

37:11.421 --> 37:13.289
Dad! Dad, answer me.

37:13.357 --> 37:14.611
What are you doing?

37:14.994 --> 37:16.893
What are you doing? Dad!

37:16.960 --> 37:18.461
What are you... crazy.

37:18.529 --> 37:22.752
I never want to talk to you ever again.
God, get me out of here.

37:23.121 --> 37:24.132
Dad!

37:24.460 --> 37:25.403
Oh!

37:28.002 --> 37:29.136
I'll tell you what.

37:30.274 --> 37:36.249
After you leave here, you can do whatever
you want with the rest of your life.

37:37.181 --> 37:38.555
You can drink.

37:39.149 --> 37:40.364
You can smoke.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.211
You can go to hell for all I care.

37:44.799 --> 37:48.591
But for the next 5 minutes,
your ass is still mine.

37:48.659 --> 37:49.759
You're holding me hostage.

37:49.826 --> 37:51.332
It's against the law.

37:52.323 --> 37:53.949
Dad, let me go.

37:59.954 --> 38:01.320
God.

38:02.005 --> 38:03.577
Stop looking at me.

38:04.547 --> 38:06.092
You never had kids.

38:06.212 --> 38:07.530
You wouldn't understand.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.000
Get up. Stand up.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.241
Dad! What are you doing?

38:13.517 --> 38:15.017
Daddy, what are you doing?

38:15.318 --> 38:16.917
Now listen to me.

38:17.148 --> 38:18.829
Do you reject Satan?

38:19.156 --> 38:20.151
Go to hell.

38:26.688 --> 38:28.297
Do you reject Satan?

38:28.365 --> 38:29.884
I hate you!

38:35.572 --> 38:37.974
Then stop, OK? Listen to me.

38:38.041 --> 38:39.775
Do you reject Satan?

38:44.893 --> 38:46.342
What the hell are you doing?

38:46.606 --> 38:48.301
Mind your own business.

38:48.421 --> 38:50.798
I swear to God, you come any closer,
I'll knock you into next week.

38:50.918 --> 38:51.921
Let her up. Let her up.

38:51.989 --> 38:52.655
Let her up.

38:56.252 --> 39:01.339
Do you reject Satan and his empty
promise of... What else do I say?

39:01.598 --> 39:03.766
What are you looking at me for?
You seem to be doing fine.

39:03.834 --> 39:06.891
That's only because I've seen "The Godfather"
like 900 goddamn times. What else do I say?

39:07.638 --> 39:09.354
Uh...
You don't know?

39:09.474 --> 39:11.333
I...I only saw "The Godfather" twice.

39:12.314 --> 39:15.539
Do you reject sin so as to live
in the freedom of God's children?

39:15.659 --> 39:16.455
Yes.

39:16.575 --> 39:19.715
Do you reject the glamour of evil
so as not to be mastered by sin?

39:19.783 --> 39:21.017
Yes. Fine.

39:21.084 --> 39:22.534
- Do you believe in the Holy Spirit?
- Yes!

39:22.654 --> 39:23.947
The communion of saints?

39:24.067 --> 39:25.054
The forgiveness of sin?

39:25.122 --> 39:27.127
Yes, goddamnit, yes.

39:29.917 --> 39:31.360
Aah!

39:33.894 --> 39:35.345
Ok, Tommy.

39:35.619 --> 39:38.120
Tom, please. Let her up.

39:43.345 --> 39:46.352
Hey, whoa... Ooh. Jeez.

39:46.472 --> 39:48.577
Oh, my God. Wait.

39:49.614 --> 39:51.814
Jeez. Uhh.

39:54.132 --> 39:55.990
Come on, Col. Come on.

39:56.337 --> 39:59.152
Colleen! Colleen!

39:59.489 --> 40:00.790
Tommy, what happened?

40:00.857 --> 40:02.887
What happened?
She OK?

40:03.007 --> 40:06.107
Yeah, yeah.
Get some towels in the sacristy.

40:06.227 --> 40:08.497
Come on, baby. Yeah, that's it.

40:08.565 --> 40:10.617
Come on. All right.

40:10.737 --> 40:12.068
Look, she's all right. She's OK.

40:12.135 --> 40:13.970
Thanks.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.242
Put the other one over there.

40:18.362 --> 40:20.183
Oh. There you go.

40:21.167 --> 40:23.161
You OK?
All right. There we go.

40:23.281 --> 40:25.815
Looks like sister
Rosemary called the law.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.883
- Oh, shit.
- I'll go see what I can do.

40:27.951 --> 40:29.385
Uh-huh. It's OK.

40:29.453 --> 40:32.153
Here. Let me have this.

40:36.649 --> 40:38.761
Well, thank God you've done your job.

40:38.829 --> 40:40.343
Now we'll let them do theirs.

40:42.799 --> 40:45.000
- All right.
- All right.

40:45.068 --> 40:46.848
Keep an eye on her for me.

40:49.873 --> 40:52.007
It's OK, baby.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.610
It's OK.

40:55.004 --> 41:05.281
