WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:05.614
<i>Previously on</i> SEAL Team ... everything okay with Sonny?

00:05.657 --> 00:07.790
Might be a little
-off his game. Why?
-I'm pregnant.

00:07.833 --> 00:09.792
You're usually foaming at the
mouth to get out of Vah Beach.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.794
-Something's brewing in Texas.
-Whatever's in Texas is

00:11.837 --> 00:13.883
gonna be there when we come
-back. I need you focused up.
-Yeah.

00:13.926 --> 00:16.625
And Ray's now a warrant officer,
so your role has changed.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.714
-My team, my system.
Are you leaving me

00:18.757 --> 00:21.586
'cause you have to go
or because you want to go?

00:21.630 --> 00:23.414
You know I would never
willingly leave you, don't you?

00:23.458 --> 00:24.894
-How's he doing out here?
The fact that he

00:24.937 --> 00:26.504
requested to start
his assignment

00:26.548 --> 00:28.463
two weeks early sets
a pretty high bar.

00:28.506 --> 00:30.987
The Navy didn't make you
come out here. You lied to me.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.336
<i>Cell phone collected on target</i>

00:32.380 --> 00:35.209
points to our seller
as Yassine Kassen,

00:35.252 --> 00:36.906
<i>aka Raqqa Jacques.</i>

00:36.949 --> 00:38.255
Nice to put a name to the face.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.430
You've seen this guy before?

00:39.474 --> 00:40.605
When he tortured me in Syria.

00:40.649 --> 00:41.998
Jason should know.

00:42.042 --> 00:42.999
You don't say a word.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.131
Part of my job is

00:44.174 --> 00:45.436
keeping an eye on my team.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.785
-On me?
-On you.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.004
You are distracting me
from my work.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.310
-Distracting you?
-Yes, you are.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.703
Get some sleep,
and get on that plane tomorrow.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.892
<i>My men told me
you escaped your bindings.</i>

01:08.938 --> 01:12.463
<i>You don't look like a magician, so you are trained, no? Army?</i>

01:16.424 --> 01:18.382
-Her name?
-Jameelah.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.493
Who knows what we've
tapped into here,

01:42.537 --> 01:43.755
but we're in.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.322
-Encryption's broken?
-Our chance

01:45.366 --> 01:47.237
to crack open Raqqa Jacques's
entire operation.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.239
Files and communications
on the hard drive

01:49.283 --> 01:51.328
go back at least a year.

01:51.372 --> 01:53.852
Well, I'm less interested
in his past than his present.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.941
We need to prioritize
any reference

01:55.985 --> 01:58.161
to the remaining two drones
or his current location.

01:58.205 --> 02:00.772
It's been eight hours since
we grabbed the laptop.

02:00.816 --> 02:03.601
Intel's got a
limited shelf life.

02:03.645 --> 02:06.126
-Morning, Master Chief.
-Morning.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.040
Boys are packing up.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.999
Getting ready to roll out.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.610
Hate leaving the mission
when it's half done,

02:12.654 --> 02:14.134
tell you that.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.092
Especially when there's
two drones out there.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.094
I'm trying to work
on that right now.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.617
Oh.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.532
You got a new, uh,

02:21.576 --> 02:23.578
new face on the board.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.188
Yassine "Raqqa Jacques" Kassen.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.234
Our arms dealer
who also executed

02:27.277 --> 02:29.192
the attack
on the U.S. base last month.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.890
Well, sounds like enough
-for a target package.
-Far from it.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.631
Nothing's actionable.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.764
Still trying to glean a location
on him and the drones.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.200
How long's that gonna take?

02:37.244 --> 02:39.289
Depends on how
distracted we are.

02:39.333 --> 02:41.813
Like I told you
last night, Jace,

02:41.857 --> 02:43.467
there's nothing
for you to do here.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.513
Right.

02:45.556 --> 02:48.559
Your op, Ray. Good luck.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.828
Go, Jace.
Let me do my job.

02:56.872 --> 02:59.266
Uh, I was just coming
to say goodbye.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.006
You okay?

03:01.050 --> 03:03.270
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

03:03.313 --> 03:05.097
Just trying to concentrate.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.190
I'll get us some coffees.

03:12.844 --> 03:15.369
So, I take it
you haven't changed your mind

03:15.412 --> 03:18.198
about letting Jason in
on who Raqqa Jacques is to you?

03:18.241 --> 03:19.851
Right now,
he's a ghost on a hard drive.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.244
And Jason's leaving.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.638
-Why read him in?
-Nothing to do operationally,

03:23.681 --> 03:25.030
but maybe he can help you.

03:25.074 --> 03:26.728
Help me how?

03:26.771 --> 03:29.034
I don't recall too many friends
in that room with Raqqa Jacques,

03:29.078 --> 03:30.297
and I'm still standing.

03:30.340 --> 03:32.386
-Ray.
-Nobody's facing him
till I can find him.

03:32.429 --> 03:35.258
And that's not happening
until I can focus, so...

03:36.390 --> 03:37.826
Please.

03:39.393 --> 03:41.960
Take care of yourself, Ray.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.705
I'm thinking
maybe we ask this pilot

03:47.749 --> 03:50.491
to divert
to this sandbox's Sin City.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.493
Don't really feel
like touching down

03:52.536 --> 03:54.408
in the real world quite yet.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.977
You got something hanging
over you back home, Sonny?

03:59.021 --> 04:00.718
Nah, it ain't that.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.633
Uh, you're ducking something.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.766
Debt collector? A warrant?

04:04.809 --> 04:06.246
Hit man?

04:06.289 --> 04:08.378
Since when does a man
need a reason to escape reality?

04:08.422 --> 04:12.382
According to Winona Ryder,
it bites.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.950
Okay, uh, so,
back in Vah Beach,

04:14.993 --> 04:16.647
what's up next for us

04:16.691 --> 04:18.301
on, uh, Soto's master plan?

04:18.345 --> 04:21.304
Uh, four days
of supervising dive training

04:21.348 --> 04:23.045
for a group of techs.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.917
Terrific. Babysitting a bunch
of Urkels with snorkels.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.484
Any way Jace can
talk 'em out of it?

04:27.528 --> 04:28.877
No. He wanted
to tear up

04:28.920 --> 04:30.139
Soto's schedule
the moment he saw it,

04:30.182 --> 04:31.271
-but we stood him down.
Really?

04:31.314 --> 04:32.576
How'd he take that?

04:32.620 --> 04:34.099
Probably worse than he let on.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.623
The guy comes back to Bravo.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.364
He's got a new boss, new system.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.583
Comes over here,
and Ray's calling the shots.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.585
Might make him wonder
where he stands.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.021
Bravo's still his team.

04:43.065 --> 04:46.634
And anyone that forgets that,
Lord have mercy.

05:18.405 --> 05:21.364
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:21.408 --> 05:24.672
Well, this could've been my
last time out with Bravo.

05:24.715 --> 05:27.501
Wish we weren't going
out with a whimper.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.329
Yeah.

05:29.372 --> 05:32.027
That's-that's got
to feel heavy, huh?

05:32.070 --> 05:33.463
Mm.

05:33.507 --> 05:36.379
I'm okay with it,
though, you know.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.250
The decision I made.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.429
-We made, right?
-Mm.

05:42.472 --> 05:43.473
So, now it's happening.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.997
Right. Yeah, it's good.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.912
It's good.

06:09.456 --> 06:11.762
Everything okay
with you and Ray?

06:11.806 --> 06:14.591
Thought I picked up on
some static back at the hotel.

06:14.635 --> 06:17.725
Yeah, just...
just some growing pains.

06:17.768 --> 06:20.380
Yeah, you'll get back
on the same page.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.382
Maybe we were never
on the same page.

06:26.081 --> 06:31.303
Now that he's warrant officer,
maybe... maybe you can say that.

06:31.347 --> 06:35.482
Yeah, you know, I assumed
that he was just...

06:35.525 --> 06:37.353
staking his ground
as warrant, too,

06:37.397 --> 06:39.877
but now...

06:39.921 --> 06:41.313
Yeah?

06:43.403 --> 06:45.143
You think what he went through
in Tunisia

06:45.187 --> 06:46.884
is finally sinking in?

06:46.928 --> 06:49.191
He's trained to handle that.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.802
For weeks, he's telling me
that he's fine,

06:51.846 --> 06:54.109
you know, everything's okay.

06:54.152 --> 06:57.112
You know, I come back to Bravo,
and I'm thinking

06:57.155 --> 06:58.505
this is where I'm meant to be.

06:58.548 --> 07:01.464
But, you know, with Ray,
the energy's off.

07:01.508 --> 07:03.161
I just feel like I'm losing him.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.648
-He told me not to tell you.
-What?

07:15.478 --> 07:18.176
This HVT he's hunting,
that Raqqa Jacques,

07:18.220 --> 07:20.048
it's the same guy
who held him captive,

07:20.091 --> 07:21.963
who tortured him.

07:23.747 --> 07:25.488
He's going after him alone.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.055
Why the hell didn't he tell me?

07:31.712 --> 07:34.323
Davis.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.630
Copy. It's Ray.

07:36.673 --> 07:37.979
He needs us back there.

07:38.022 --> 07:40.503
All right.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.462
The actionable intel comes
with a tight clock,

07:42.505 --> 07:44.420
-so let's get into it.
-Ray, we need to talk.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.814
Not now, Jason.

07:46.857 --> 07:50.208
HVT's name is Yassine Kassen.
French-Algerian.

07:50.252 --> 07:53.037
Known in jihadi circles
as Raqqa Jacques.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.126
Earned his caliphate cred
in Raqqa

07:55.170 --> 07:57.477
during the siege of that city,
and for the last three years

07:57.520 --> 08:00.262
has been leading a paramilitary
offshoot of AKM.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.569
-Leading them in what?
-Whole gamut.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.875
Propaganda, recruiting fighters,
raising money.

08:04.919 --> 08:06.790
Helped build a robust
trafficking network.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.052
Weapons, women.

08:08.096 --> 08:10.011
May have dabbled in
kidnap and ransom.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.230
You sure he didn't get his hands
dirtier than that?

08:13.710 --> 08:16.974
He's been using arms sales
to fund direct actions.

08:17.018 --> 08:19.890
Executed the drone attack on the
U.S. base in Baghdad that killed

08:19.934 --> 08:21.979
12 service members.
And now...

08:22.023 --> 08:23.981
we believe he plans to deploy
his remaining drones

08:24.025 --> 08:26.549
to take down two commercial
airliners 72 hours from now.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.899
Laptop we recovered
contained flight data,

08:28.943 --> 08:30.901
which can be programmed
into the weaponized drones.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.990
Even if those flights are
notified and grounded,

08:33.034 --> 08:35.645
which blows our op here,
there's no telling where

08:35.689 --> 08:37.647
he shifts the drones' crosshairs
once they've launched.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.214
We got a location on 'em?

08:39.257 --> 08:40.868
-The drones?
Not yet.

08:40.911 --> 08:43.566
But we're circling one
of his close lieutenants.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.089
Syrian national
named Dabir Ganim.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.830
Intel says he's
currently staying

08:46.874 --> 08:48.223
somewhere in
Bisharat Square,

08:48.266 --> 08:49.529
right here in Irbid.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.182
Bravo Team is gonna aid me
in tracking him

08:51.226 --> 08:52.532
so we can tap into his network

08:52.575 --> 08:53.750
and find the remaining
two drones.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.970
And Raqqa Jacques?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.146
Goes without saying.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.801
All right, let's finish the job.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.280
Yeah.

09:02.324 --> 09:03.847
Go ahead, drop your
bags upstairs,

09:03.891 --> 09:07.155
then we'll get into
mission details.

09:07.198 --> 09:11.463
So, why don't you tell me
who he really is?

09:16.120 --> 09:18.514
I reported the intel
to those who needed to know.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.037
Okay?

09:20.081 --> 09:22.474
It's background, not relevant
to the current operation.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.085
Of course it's relevant.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.914
Is that why you came
out here early? Huh?

09:26.957 --> 09:29.394
You've been tracking this guy
-for weeks.
-No, no, no, no.

09:29.438 --> 09:31.440
I did not find out he was
involved until last night.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.181
Ah.
What?

09:35.183 --> 09:37.620
Davis didn't tell you that
when she ran her mouth?

09:39.970 --> 09:43.800
Look, who he is
doesn't change anything.

09:43.844 --> 09:45.280
Then why'd you keep it from me?

09:45.323 --> 09:46.934
Because I've been
working the problem alone

09:46.977 --> 09:49.719
since that bomb threw me
across the room.

09:49.763 --> 09:53.070
I'm squared away, so I do not
need you playing hero.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.032
We got an op to focus on, okay?

09:58.075 --> 10:00.077
So do not mention it to anyone.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.688
I'm the officer
in charge,

10:01.731 --> 10:03.341
and if you cannot honor
those terms,

10:03.385 --> 10:06.257
Jason, I will cank this op.

10:08.216 --> 10:10.348
Understood?
Copy that,

10:10.392 --> 10:11.785
Warrant Officer Perry.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.533
Bravo will fan out
in Bisharat Square,

10:21.577 --> 10:22.839
and this device will
use your phones

10:22.883 --> 10:25.320
to scan for cell IPs
in a hundred-yard radius,

10:25.363 --> 10:26.930
funneling the data
back to Ray.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.366
Get a hit on the target's IP,

10:28.410 --> 10:29.803
we'll be able
to close in on him.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.282
This lieutenant
we're after,

10:31.326 --> 10:34.111
he happen to be a catfishing
Moldovan dude named Igor?

10:34.155 --> 10:36.374
'Cause Brock's phone is really
great at finding them.

10:36.418 --> 10:38.725
You would have
fallen for her, too.

10:38.768 --> 10:40.814
-All right, let's focus up, okay?
Yo.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.554
Mina read you in on the tech?

10:42.598 --> 10:45.296
Yup, all set to join you in the
S.A. world of secrets and lies.

10:45.340 --> 10:48.256
I just hope that we can adapt
as quickly as you have, Ray.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.738
We locate Ganim, we stay on him

10:51.781 --> 10:53.957
until there's a chance to
snatch him and cell his phone.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.437
Now, I do not need
to remind you,

10:55.480 --> 10:57.352
we are unwelcome guests here,
which means

10:57.395 --> 10:59.789
the Jordanian authorities cannot
catch one whiff of us operating.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.443
That's why
we're bringing pistols.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.010
Last resort only.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.402
This gets loud,
it means we've failed.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.534
But we have suppressors.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.405
We know the rules.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.103
We know who we're after.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.974
Brock? Clock's ticking, boys.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.546
Jason forget that you're
the officer in charge here?

11:32.779 --> 11:34.258
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 6.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.695
We're in position.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.044
Copy, Bravo 6.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.699
-You're getting their feeds?
-Yup.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.440
Got, uh, Brock, Metal and Trent.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.964
Takes time for the device

11:44.007 --> 11:45.487
to sift through the cell IPs
in the area.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.054
All Bravo elements,

11:47.097 --> 11:49.926
hold what you got.

12:05.942 --> 12:08.118
What's going on
with you, man?

12:08.162 --> 12:10.512
Fumbled the det cord yesterday,
and now you're zoning out here.

12:10.555 --> 12:11.905
Where's your
head been?

12:11.948 --> 12:13.602
Firmly attached to my fat neck.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.518
You know what Davis thinks?

12:16.561 --> 12:17.911
She thinks you got the yips
about being with her

12:17.954 --> 12:19.042
now that it's starting
to get real.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.348
You tell her it ain't true?

12:20.391 --> 12:21.784
Told her I'm not sure
what's on your back,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.743
but it's something.

12:23.786 --> 12:27.355
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it sure is something.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.315
When I was back
in Texas, I, uh,

12:31.359 --> 12:33.578
ran into an old friend
that I used to be close with,

12:33.622 --> 12:36.538
and... something happened.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.846
And now that something is
gonna be here in four months.

12:39.889 --> 12:41.717
-A kid?
-News was a parting gift

12:41.761 --> 12:44.459
-just before we spun up.
-Wow.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.156
Sonny Quinn a dad, huh?

12:46.200 --> 12:47.418
Not if I can help it.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.077
Davis doesn't know?

12:54.121 --> 12:56.732
It's a Lot to saddle her with
over here.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.169
You know, with the demands
of the job,

12:59.213 --> 13:01.824
and the little thing
I got going on with Davis,

13:01.868 --> 13:03.826
you know, maybe
it doesn't change anything.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.610
A kid?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.438
I can't see how
that doesn't change things.

13:07.482 --> 13:09.223
Well, it ain't for you
to figure it out, is it?

13:12.269 --> 13:14.315
Davis doesn't need
to hear about this.

13:14.358 --> 13:15.795
Okay?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.016
Copy.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.982
You know, I can help you
with that if you show me

13:29.025 --> 13:30.461
how to use it.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.854
Yeah, says the guy
that just retired his Walkman.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.290
It's funny.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.989
And very true. Yes, I did.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.947
Your hands got the worst
of it, huh?

13:39.514 --> 13:41.995
-Hard to say.
-You all right?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.605
You haven't talked
about your captivity.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.173
If you're at peace with
that, and it's behind you,

13:46.216 --> 13:48.218
I'm good with that, but
what I'm not good with

13:48.262 --> 13:50.351
is what's going on
between you and I.

13:51.874 --> 13:56.009
Look, the reason
I came out here early was...

13:56.052 --> 13:58.185
I just needed some space, man.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.100
All right, no one hawking
over my shoulder,

14:00.143 --> 14:02.189
questioning me,
worrying about me,

14:02.232 --> 14:03.843
like everybody's been
doing since I got home.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.757
It's exhausting.

14:09.152 --> 14:12.764
Way it goes at night, it...

14:12.808 --> 14:16.725
I get woken by the aches
in my hands, the...

14:16.768 --> 14:18.770
the wound in my leg.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.122
It was a power drill, Jason.

14:24.472 --> 14:26.561
Raqqa Jacques got hands-on
with them.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.519
Oh.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.785
The pains...

14:35.222 --> 14:38.486
Some of the thoughts
that crawl in with them.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.488
I slip out of bed
to go downstairs

14:40.531 --> 14:43.534
to, you know, get some ice
to numb it.

14:43.578 --> 14:47.147
The thing is, the dream home's
got creaky floors

14:47.190 --> 14:48.757
and a damn ice maker
that sounds like a 50-cal.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.280
Whole house wakes up.

14:50.324 --> 14:51.891
Then they're asking me
why I'm up.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.154
"I'm just getting
a glass of water."

14:57.331 --> 14:59.115
I gotta lie to 'em, J.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.729
I hate lying to 'em.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.909
How do I put that...
that vision in Naima's head?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.478
How do I end
Jameelah's childhood

15:14.522 --> 15:17.220
by letting her know
that type of evil exists?

15:17.264 --> 15:19.919
That's what this guy did to you.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.399
Keeps doing, on the bad nights.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.667
Target cell phone just popped.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.495
Bravo 3, Bravo 6,

15:31.539 --> 15:33.236
we got a hit in the building
to your northeast.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.586
Shift position to the backside
to give me a more accurate read.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.123
Friends of our target?

16:16.932 --> 16:18.281
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 6.

16:18.325 --> 16:20.066
Two men just entered,
one carrying an AK.

16:20.109 --> 16:21.458
Left the car running.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.069
-We need to get in there, Ray.
-It's not happening.

16:23.112 --> 16:24.679
Armed security inside means
we're not taking him quietly.

16:24.722 --> 16:26.507
-That's the op ord.
-We're not taking Ganim

16:26.550 --> 16:28.074
at all if we lose them.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.119
Bravo 9, this is Bravo 2.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.034
HVT may move out
with armed company.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.036
We need to pursue until he's
in a controlled environment.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.386
-Over.
Copy, Bravo 2.
Pursuit's gonna be a challenge.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.388
We've got limited assets
and no way to follow

16:38.432 --> 16:39.781
if he slips into Syria.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.261
Look, we need to
make entry now.

16:41.304 --> 16:42.653
Grab him and the phone.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.351
A kinetic hit takes approval
from the Jordanians,

16:44.394 --> 16:45.787
which takes calls
from our diplomatic channels.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.658
It's a waste of time
that we do not have.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.051
I'll call Command
and get the gears moving

16:49.095 --> 16:50.270
so we can get it cleared.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.881
Losing that guy means
we lose Raqqa Jacques.

16:52.924 --> 16:55.231
I'm not letting him walk away
after what he did to you.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.669
That's not how
this works, Jason.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.117
All Bravo elements,
meet in the alley,

17:11.160 --> 17:13.206
red side of target.
We're going internal.

17:19.429 --> 17:23.477
Okay, Clay, Sonny, Trent,
post up security here.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.827
The rest of you come
with me and Ray.

17:25.870 --> 17:26.958
Ganim plus the two
from the outside,

17:27.002 --> 17:28.090
that makes at least
three shooters.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.048
Are we sure this is
the right move?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.701
We're gonna go in quick
and quiet.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.877
No one's gonna even
-know we're here.
-Ray, are we cleared...

17:32.921 --> 17:34.792
It's not open for discussion.
Let's move.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.856
Ganim's cell phone.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.597
This mood doesn't
scream victory.

18:40.641 --> 18:43.687
-What'd I miss?
-No time to waste.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.778
No one's gonna ask?

18:50.607 --> 18:51.869
What happened back there?

18:51.913 --> 18:53.088
-What's that mean?
-I mean, Ray said
in the WARNO

18:53.132 --> 18:54.611
that going kinetic
wasn't an option.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.091
I thought we weren't
supposed to tip the Jordanians

18:56.135 --> 18:57.658
of us operating here.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.268
You know, yesterday, you said
you wanted to be a sled dog.

18:59.312 --> 19:00.530
Sled dogs, they keep
their mouths shut.

19:00.574 --> 19:01.618
They don't ask questions.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.490
We wouldn't have
bent the rules

19:03.533 --> 19:05.666
without good reason.
We all know that.

19:05.709 --> 19:07.320
Tell you what,
you want reasons?

19:07.363 --> 19:10.105
How about two 747s being
blown out of the sky

19:10.149 --> 19:11.933
if we sit on our hands,
how's that?

19:11.976 --> 19:14.109
We hunt plenty of HVTs
with bad intentions

19:14.153 --> 19:15.458
without breaking ROEs.

19:15.502 --> 19:16.633
If you knew who we
were going after,

19:16.677 --> 19:18.026
you wouldn't be
asking questions.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.598
Who are we after?

19:26.339 --> 19:27.992
There something we're missing?

19:35.086 --> 19:37.350
The HVT is...

19:37.393 --> 19:41.092
<i>was</i> the man that tortured me
during my captivity.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.795
That change things
for you, Clay?

19:47.838 --> 19:49.405
That didn't change anything.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.712
Not why we went kinetic.
There were sound tactical

19:51.755 --> 19:55.237
and strategic reasons
why we went ...ger that.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.157
Rest up.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.681
We're on standby until Mina
and Davis get something.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.643
Hey.

20:09.686 --> 20:13.124
That is the second time you have
backed me into a corner.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.865
First the op, and now
in front of Bravo?

20:14.909 --> 20:16.519
You truly cannot
help yourself, can you?

20:16.563 --> 20:17.912
It's your op, Ray.
Your op.

20:17.955 --> 20:19.479
You could have shut me down,
but you knew that

20:19.522 --> 20:20.915
it was the right
tactical call.

20:20.958 --> 20:22.438
Jason Hayes, you
just... you just know

20:22.482 --> 20:23.787
what's best for
everybody, don't you?

20:23.831 --> 20:25.049
No, I'm just trying to get you
what you deserve.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.312
That's justice.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.139
-Vengeance, you mean.
-What he did to you,

20:28.183 --> 20:30.272
what you told me
he continues to do to you,

20:30.316 --> 20:31.969
there's only one way
past it.

20:34.320 --> 20:35.495
Come on, you can't tell me

20:35.538 --> 20:36.800
you don't want to
take this guy down hard.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.759
Of course I do! I wanted
to rip his throat out

20:38.802 --> 20:40.151
from the moment I saw him,

20:40.195 --> 20:42.806
but that ain't the
mission here, Jace.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.373
Vengeance?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.766
I don't want to be
the guy chasing that.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.290
You don't have to be.

20:48.334 --> 20:49.944
Everything you went through

20:49.987 --> 20:53.513
and continue to go through,
this is your one chance,

20:53.556 --> 20:54.905
one chance to annihilate it.

20:59.127 --> 21:01.260
You really think
it's that simple?

21:01.303 --> 21:05.089
I just... put him down
and it goes away?

21:06.221 --> 21:10.312
Something like that. Yeah.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.531
Yes, I do.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.237
Oh. What are we looking at?

21:22.281 --> 21:23.891
Just pinged a cluster of ten IPs

21:23.934 --> 21:25.414
pulled from the cloned cell.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.981
All of them were in
and out of the site

21:27.024 --> 21:28.765
where Bravo found
the other drones.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.725
Burner phones, but the pattern
of communication suggests

21:31.768 --> 21:33.640
Raqqa Jacques is
likely among the group.

21:33.683 --> 21:35.076
And the current
location suggests

21:35.119 --> 21:37.774
that this isn't just a
friendly get-together.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.689
They're at
a Syrian Army base?

21:39.733 --> 21:41.343
-MINA:
-Decommissioned six years ago,

21:41.387 --> 21:42.866
intel says it's been
left to ruin.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.216
However, it's proximate to
the targeted flight paths,

21:45.260 --> 21:48.350
making it the perfect spot
to launch the drones from.

21:48.394 --> 21:50.352
Is this tracking in real time?

21:50.396 --> 21:51.440
Is, uh, Raqqa Jacques
there now?

21:51.484 --> 21:52.746
There's a ten-minute lag.

21:52.789 --> 21:54.313
I'm gonna get an S.A. tech
to tighten it.

22:02.538 --> 22:05.062
Hey, um...

22:05.106 --> 22:06.803
Wanted to give this to you
when we got home, but...

22:10.459 --> 22:11.721
Here.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.767
You asked me to find
the contact info

22:13.810 --> 22:15.421
for the family of the
guy you were with.

22:15.464 --> 22:18.815
Zied? I found a number
for his widow and son.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.124
Thanks.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.517
Yeah.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.519
Not sure why I wanted that.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.218
You said that you thought
it might help.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.134
Give some closure.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.181
Talking's not gonna
change anything.

22:37.225 --> 22:39.227
<i>Intel suggests the drones
are being staged</i>

22:39.270 --> 22:41.229
<i>from the grounds
of a decommissioned base</i>

22:41.272 --> 22:43.971
located six miles over
the border in Syria.

22:44.014 --> 22:46.930
Our objective is to recover
the drones and blow in place.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.715
roll slick
until we're through

22:48.758 --> 22:50.151
the border checkpoint.

22:50.194 --> 22:51.370
Sound good, Jace?

22:51.413 --> 22:53.502
Roger that. Kit up in transit.

22:53.546 --> 22:55.635
Cell phone activity shows
at least ten individuals

22:55.678 --> 22:58.289
on target, all believed
to be fighting-age males.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.161
And considering
how this crew gets paid,

23:00.204 --> 23:01.467
expect serious weaponry.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.730
The drones are
our primary target.

23:05.601 --> 23:06.820
And Raqqa Jacques?

23:07.995 --> 23:09.779
If he's there,
open season.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.525
Any questions?

23:17.613 --> 23:19.180
All right.
Let's get to it.

23:19.223 --> 23:21.008
<i>If I was in Ray's shoes,
I would've went</i>

23:21.051 --> 23:23.053
full <i>Unforgiven</i> Eastwood
the second I saw

23:23.097 --> 23:25.142
that creep's photo pop up.

23:25.186 --> 23:28.189
I just don't get why he kept
it secret and held fire.

23:28.232 --> 23:30.452
He was doing what
was best for Bravo.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.106
Hard to remain calm in the chaos

23:32.149 --> 23:33.803
when we're worried
about settling scores.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.458
Yeah, just glad that
Jace dug his spurs in.

23:36.502 --> 23:39.113
Ray's just too good
for his own good sometimes.

23:39.156 --> 23:41.724
You grading on
the Sonny Quinn curve?

23:44.858 --> 23:47.600
You want to take a shot,
do it straight-on.

23:49.776 --> 23:51.386
What, you don't like how
I'm handling my situation?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.823
Well, I thought your plan
was just to not handle it.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.782
You have no idea
what I'm wrestling with, do you?

23:55.825 --> 23:58.828
You're right. I really should've
seen it from Ash's side

23:58.872 --> 24:00.743
when I was five
and he hit the road.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.443
I thought you were
burned by your old man, too.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.836
I shouldn't have
told you a damn thing.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.447
No, you should've told Davis,
because she's over here

24:08.490 --> 24:10.144
and she's shuffling her career
around just to be with you,

24:10.187 --> 24:12.189
but you don't have the sack
to just be honest with her.

24:12.233 --> 24:15.454
There are two things
that I swore I would never do,

24:15.497 --> 24:18.805
is break her heart, and see
my old man in the mirror.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.242
I'm-I'm just trying
to figure out

24:21.285 --> 24:23.505
the-the least amount of pain
I can cause anyone right now,

24:23.549 --> 24:25.638
and I'm sorry
it's taking me a minute.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.642
Look, hey. Hey, Sonny.

24:29.685 --> 24:31.295
I-I'm sorry.
Okay? I didn't ...Save it.

24:31.339 --> 24:34.777
Seriously. I heard enough of
your self-righteousness already.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.720
Target IPs haven't moved.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.766
Mission criteria is all go.

25:08.855 --> 25:11.553
Not easy, I bet, huh?

25:11.597 --> 25:13.686
Close as you are
with these guys,

25:13.729 --> 25:16.340
sending them into the fire.

25:16.384 --> 25:19.518
It's a roller coaster.

25:19.561 --> 25:21.520
This might be my last ride.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.956
Making a move?

25:22.999 --> 25:26.089
To a new team.
Time to switch it up.

25:26.133 --> 25:28.135
I think.

25:46.414 --> 25:48.590
Bravo 2, this is Havoc.

25:48.634 --> 25:49.765
Be advised, seven of the tangos

25:49.809 --> 25:51.854
appear to have
departed the base.

25:51.898 --> 25:54.465
Bravo 2, copy all. Break.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.902
All vehicles slow, slow.

26:01.951 --> 26:03.779
Havoc, you got a pos
on the departed seven?

26:03.823 --> 26:07.174
Just located them
11 miles north. Stationary.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.089
Leaves at least three
on target here.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.526
-Maybe the drones.
-Bravo 2, what's the call?

26:11.570 --> 26:14.616
Push ahead to the base, or
split off to get to the others?

26:16.009 --> 26:18.098
Base is still the likeliest
location for the drones.

26:18.141 --> 26:21.014
Whoever might've left.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.232
Bravo,

26:22.276 --> 26:23.799
proceed to primary target.

27:07.408 --> 27:08.975
Three...

27:10.063 --> 27:12.892
...two, one.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.154
Execute.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.040
Raqqa Jacques?

27:31.084 --> 27:32.912
Negative.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.264
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.
Drones recovered.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.658
Prepping to blow in place.
Brock, set the charges.

27:42.051 --> 27:44.358
Target's clear.
We got status on HVT?

27:44.401 --> 27:45.707
Raqqa Jacques is not here.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.452
Havoc, this is 1.
Seven IPs that left target,

27:51.495 --> 27:53.062
they still stationary?

27:53.106 --> 27:55.151
Copy, Bravo 1.
They're at the same grid,

27:55.195 --> 27:56.587
11 miles from your pos.

27:57.632 --> 27:58.938
11 miles?

28:00.591 --> 28:03.464
Follow-on like that's walking
the edge of mission umbrella.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.858
But not over it.
Night's still young.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.990
-I'm in.
-I'm in, too.

28:09.122 --> 28:10.993
Your call, Ray.

28:12.429 --> 28:14.214
Havoc, this is Bravo 2.

28:14.257 --> 28:17.434
Send follow-on target grid
to ATAKs. Over.

28:23.179 --> 28:25.747
Hitting this other target,
it is what you want, right?

28:25.791 --> 28:28.750
My call. If Jason were here,
you wouldn't ask that.

28:28.794 --> 28:31.840
And if Jace weren't here,
we'd still be heading this way?

28:34.277 --> 28:36.715
Raqqa Jacques killed 12 people
with that strike last month

28:36.758 --> 28:38.368
and was hoping to kill
a few hundred more

28:38.412 --> 28:40.588
with the drones
we just destroyed.

28:40.631 --> 28:42.416
We let him go, you think
he just calls it a day?

28:42.459 --> 28:44.026
Not questioning that.

28:44.070 --> 28:46.246
So, what, then?
You need me to quote UCMJ code

28:46.289 --> 28:47.464
puts this mission
on solid ground?

28:47.508 --> 28:48.988
Clear up any gray area for you?

28:49.031 --> 28:51.207
Because I can do that.
Chapter and verse.

28:51.251 --> 28:53.122
It's not that.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.733
Well, if it's not the target
and not the mission,

28:54.776 --> 28:56.299
what are you questioning?

28:56.343 --> 28:57.605
What are you
questioning?

28:58.824 --> 29:00.390
You're good, I'm good.

29:11.097 --> 29:13.229
I don't recall you voicing
any concerns when we took out

29:13.273 --> 29:15.101
the people that damn near
blew off your leg.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.626
Hmm?

29:18.669 --> 29:20.454
The paths that led me and this
man to cross the first time,

29:20.497 --> 29:22.151
the chances
that it happened again?

29:24.501 --> 29:26.025
11-mile detour
is nothing for me.

31:06.821 --> 31:08.214
Barricaded shooter.

31:08.257 --> 31:10.346
He's trying recon
by fire. Can't see us.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.350
Frag out.

31:17.745 --> 31:18.920
Squirter.

31:20.835 --> 31:22.881
Sonny, with you.
-Ray on security.
-Roger.

32:30.731 --> 32:32.124
Ray.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.345
Ray, you good?

32:38.782 --> 32:41.481
Ray.

32:41.524 --> 32:44.310
Yeah.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.312
I'm good.

32:51.186 --> 32:53.362
This is Bravo 6. Got them.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.886
-Green side. Exterior's clear.
-Good copy, Bravo 6.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.671
-Target secure.
-We're clear.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.368
Sonny, we're clear.

32:59.412 --> 33:00.761
Sonny?

33:00.804 --> 33:02.589
Sonny. Hey.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.025
All right, okay.

33:04.069 --> 33:05.244
Got his wing.

33:05.287 --> 33:07.637
Get down. All right, hold it.

33:07.681 --> 33:08.987
All stations, clear the net.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.510
Havoc Base,
this is Bravo 2.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.686
Request CASEVAC.
I repeat, immediate CASEVAC.

33:12.729 --> 33:14.514
Wounded Eagle. Bravo 3's down.

33:14.557 --> 33:15.950
Sonny.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.740
Sonny!

33:23.784 --> 33:26.308
Clear for CASEVAC?

33:28.876 --> 33:31.139
-Are we clear?
-Yeah, it's clear.
What the hell happened?

33:31.183 --> 33:32.880
He took a round. We got him.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.274
Shouldn't have been here.

33:35.317 --> 33:36.623
-What?
-You pushed for
that follow-on

33:36.666 --> 33:37.928
-and put us here.
Stop it, Spenser.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.060
Now.
This should have
never happened.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.888
You put Sonny in
that bullet's path.

33:40.931 --> 33:42.063
-Shut up, Blondie!
Come on.

33:42.107 --> 33:43.325
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.326
CASEVAC's three mikes out.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.502
Copy that, Havoc. Let's go.

33:46.546 --> 33:47.851
Come on. Move, move, move.

33:49.853 --> 33:51.464
I got you.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.347
Sonny's being treated
at Ramstein.

34:05.391 --> 34:08.133
He's stable.
Might even beat us home.

34:09.134 --> 34:11.136
That's good.

34:11.179 --> 34:12.702
Really good. Thanks.

34:15.792 --> 34:17.011
Have a seat.

34:25.150 --> 34:29.067
Emotions got the best
of me out there.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.460
What happened to Sonny
wasn't on you.

34:31.504 --> 34:33.462
Yeah, course it was, man.

34:33.506 --> 34:37.771
Everything falls on Bravo 1,
good, bad.

34:37.814 --> 34:40.513
All I can do is try
to make the right calls

34:40.556 --> 34:42.167
for the right reasons.

34:43.646 --> 34:47.085
Sometimes it's, uh,
not that clear.

34:51.611 --> 34:54.570
The boys appreciate
what you did for Ray.

34:54.614 --> 34:56.616
You got him what he needed.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.077
Ah, you're still here.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.430
Why wouldn't I be?

35:28.474 --> 35:31.172
Most people get the hint
when the patient dozes off

35:31.216 --> 35:33.218
to leave.

35:33.261 --> 35:35.611
I'm guessing that's what
the rest of the team did.

35:36.743 --> 35:39.180
But not Florence
Blondingale.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.401
How you feeling?

35:42.444 --> 35:44.359
Uh, like a boar that got into

35:44.403 --> 35:47.101
my grandninny's turnip garden
when I was a kid.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.148
You're probably feeling
worse than I am, though, uh,

35:50.191 --> 35:51.714
after what you
said to Jace.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.977
I should've kept my mouth shut.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.457
On multiple fronts.

35:55.501 --> 35:57.807
Look, man,
it wasn't right for me

35:57.851 --> 35:59.331
to get on you
about your business.

35:59.374 --> 36:01.333
It's all good, man.

36:01.376 --> 36:04.292
Long flight, heavy pharma,

36:04.336 --> 36:09.123
you know, let me, uh...
let me really think things over.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.429
You figure out
what you're gonna do?

36:16.913 --> 36:18.219
I'm gonna, uh,

36:18.263 --> 36:21.396
I'm gonna go meet up
with the boys at the Bulkhead.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.224
Good luck with her, buddy.

36:23.268 --> 36:24.704
He's all yours.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.401
Thank you.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.970
Hey.
Hi.

36:30.013 --> 36:31.232
I was hoping you, uh,

36:31.276 --> 36:32.581
hadn't skedaddled
with the rest of them.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.235
Mm-mm.

36:34.279 --> 36:36.368
Just, you know,
spending a little quality time

36:36.411 --> 36:38.370
-in the hospital cafeteria.
-Oh, yeah?

36:38.413 --> 36:40.023
Yeah, it's quite a selection.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.940
Is that, uh, is that what
you want to talk about?

36:45.377 --> 36:47.074
Did you have something else
in mind?

36:52.949 --> 36:54.299
Look, Lisa, this-this ...nny,

36:54.342 --> 36:55.691
you don't-- you don't need
to do this right now.

36:55.735 --> 36:57.606
No, no, it's not what,
it's not what you think.

36:57.650 --> 37:01.480
Okay? It's not a-a problem
between me and you.

37:01.523 --> 37:02.872
At least...

37:04.004 --> 37:05.614
Well, I-I'm hoping
that it's not.

37:08.356 --> 37:13.840
Look, you, uh,
you remember Hannah,

37:13.883 --> 37:16.059
that I was with
in Texas?

37:16.103 --> 37:18.018
Um...

37:18.061 --> 37:21.064
Well, uh...

37:21.108 --> 37:22.718
...she's pregnant.

37:25.330 --> 37:28.637
Listen, I had a
thousand questions

37:28.681 --> 37:30.335
blasting through my
head since I heard,

37:30.378 --> 37:32.511
but there is one thing
that I haven't questioned,

37:32.554 --> 37:34.513
and that's me and you.

37:37.646 --> 37:41.171
Have you talked to her about
how you'll be involved?

37:42.260 --> 37:43.826
No. Uh...

37:43.870 --> 37:46.046
I don't even know
what my next move is.

37:47.134 --> 37:49.223
But whatever
it is, uh...

37:50.224 --> 37:51.965
...I want it to be
with you, Lisa.

37:57.405 --> 38:02.018
The road just never seems to
straighten out for us, does it?

38:02.062 --> 38:04.020
Yeah.

38:14.988 --> 38:17.860
So scary about Sonny.

38:17.904 --> 38:20.385
Yeah. But, you know,
he's on the mend.

38:20.428 --> 38:21.690
Shouldn't be sidelined too long.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.126
Must be rough
for Jason.

38:23.170 --> 38:25.172
His big return,
and that happens.

38:25.215 --> 38:28.697
I didn't make it
any easier on him.

38:28.741 --> 38:31.178
Kind of, uh...
kind of lit him up for it.

38:31.221 --> 38:33.093
I thought you were
all about following his lead.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.921
Head down, no questions asked.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.358
In the field, there's no
better footsteps to follow.

38:37.402 --> 38:41.014
Even his dicey calls
are coming from a good place.

38:41.057 --> 38:42.842
But at home,
it's a different story.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.278
What do you mean?

38:44.322 --> 38:46.411
Ray's got more of the
balance I'm looking for.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.674
He's built a family.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.806
A relationship
that's unshakeable.

38:50.850 --> 38:52.982
No matter what he's
gone through, you know?

38:53.026 --> 38:56.290
Yeah. Some steep odds
he and Naima have beat.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.465
It's not luck.

38:57.509 --> 39:00.076
-They made it happen.
-Mm.

39:00.120 --> 39:02.383
And that's what I--
that's what I want.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.211
You know?

39:04.254 --> 39:07.997
More than just a vacation
with you whenever it fits in.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.132
Move in with me.

39:14.264 --> 39:16.919
Wow.

39:21.271 --> 39:23.535
Is that an either/or? Because,
uh, I really was looking forward

39:23.578 --> 39:25.972
to, uh, a tropical getaway.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.195
What?

39:32.239 --> 39:33.588
We are so burning
every single piece

39:33.632 --> 39:35.285
of so-called furniture you have.

39:35.329 --> 39:37.331
Happily.
Good.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.905
I can see the game tape
flashing before your eyes.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.167
What is up?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.951
Eh...

39:48.995 --> 39:50.866
just thinking maybe
I pushed too hard on this one.

39:50.910 --> 39:52.128
No, man.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.565
Heat of battle, Sonny bleeding,

39:53.608 --> 39:55.218
Clay didn't know
what he was saying.

39:55.262 --> 39:57.438
Nah, just, you know,
coming back to Bravo,

39:57.482 --> 39:59.484
I just thought that I'd be
coming back to something

39:59.527 --> 40:02.051
that was, you know,
familiar to me.

40:02.095 --> 40:03.705
And with Soto pushing
his weight around

40:03.749 --> 40:06.839
and you, you know,
stepping up to OIC and...

40:06.882 --> 40:08.667
I didn't know where I stood.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.713
I just felt out of place.
Didn't know what my role was.

40:11.757 --> 40:14.542
Enter Raqqa Jacques,
my problem becomes yours.

40:14.586 --> 40:16.718
Nah, you know what?
You gave me a target.

40:16.762 --> 40:19.155
You know, gave me something
that I could help you with,

40:19.199 --> 40:21.201
close a chapter.

40:23.246 --> 40:27.381
Just can't stop thinking,
you know...

40:27.425 --> 40:29.731
what if it was worse for Sonny?

40:29.775 --> 40:31.341
Yeah, but it wasn't.

40:31.385 --> 40:34.823
Hey, what you did--
what we did?
Mm-hmm?

40:34.867 --> 40:36.477
That was justified.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.698
Raqqa Jacques is erased.
That's mission success.

40:39.741 --> 40:42.527
Yeah.

40:42.570 --> 40:44.964
How about you? Taking him out.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.400
Help you?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.663
I'll be able to sleep,
thanks to what you did.

40:48.707 --> 40:51.231
-Good.
-You know, running
the team on this one

40:51.274 --> 40:52.754
just reminded me of the tough
choices you have to make

40:52.798 --> 40:54.190
every time
you lead us out.

40:54.234 --> 40:57.455
Bravo wouldn't be the
same without you, brother.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.328
How about Naima?
How's she doing?

41:01.371 --> 41:03.069
Is she holding up
all right, too?

41:03.112 --> 41:05.288
Ah, yeah. Absolutely.

41:05.332 --> 41:07.465
Like I said, everybody's
gonna get some sleep tonight.

41:07.508 --> 41:08.727
Right.

41:08.770 --> 41:11.120
Well, I'd buy you another round,

41:11.164 --> 41:14.689
but you probably want
to get home, right?

41:14.733 --> 41:15.908
You know what?

41:15.951 --> 41:17.344
What's the rush?

41:17.387 --> 41:19.128
This one's on me.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.831
Hey. Stella duck out?

41:25.874 --> 41:27.267
Yeah. School night.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.921
You know, if she doesn't
get to see Sonny do

41:28.964 --> 41:31.010
his little drunken
robot dance ...don't want to see that.

41:31.053 --> 41:33.055
...then what's the point in
-sticking around, right?
-I agree with you.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.536
Master Chief Hayes.
I'm NCIS Agent Salazar.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.756
Okay.

41:37.799 --> 41:40.410
By order of Commander DEVGRU,
I'm placing you into custody,

41:40.454 --> 41:42.282
suspected of
violating Article 119

41:42.325 --> 41:43.675
of the Uniform Code
of Military Justice.

41:43.718 --> 41:45.154
What are you talking about?

41:45.198 --> 41:46.547
Please turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

41:46.591 --> 41:49.158
-Jason, what's going on?
-I don't know.
