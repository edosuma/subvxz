00:02.769 --> 00:05.169
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.507
Hello?

00:14.314 --> 00:15.611
Computer, who activated

00:15.682 --> 00:17.980
the emergency medical
holographic program?

00:18.084 --> 00:20.314
Auto-initiation
of the EMH program

00:20.387 --> 00:23.413
occurred when a shipwide
Red Alert was initiated.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.152
Emergency?

00:26.226 --> 00:28.160
Sick Bay to Bridge.

00:29.729 --> 00:31.959
Captain Janeway, please respond.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.626
Captain Janeway
is not on board the ship.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.669
Well, then, who's in command?

00:36.736 --> 00:40.297
lnternal scans indicate
no crew members are on board.

00:40.373 --> 00:44.275
You mean, the ship's empty?

00:44.344 --> 00:45.834
Affirmative.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.256 --> 02:38.087
What is
the crew's current location?

02:38.158 --> 02:39.090
Unknown.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.592
Did they go on shore leave?

02:40.660 --> 02:43.561
Are they dead? What?

02:43.630 --> 02:46.098
That information
is not available.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.566
Can you give me
a ship's status report?

02:48.635 --> 02:50.034
Affirmative.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.333
Warp core is off-line.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.430
The ship is restricted
to emergency power

02:54.507 --> 02:56.600
and auxiliary systems only.

02:56.676 --> 03:01.045
Structural integrity breach
on Deck 6, Deck 7 and Deck 12.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.082
Deflector shields inoperative.

03:03.149 --> 03:05.014
Weapons array off-line.

03:05.084 --> 03:07.143
Communications off-line.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.744
Sewage and waste reclamation...

03:08.821 --> 03:11.016
All right, l get the idea.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.717
What caused this damage?

03:12.792 --> 03:14.919
That information
is not available.

03:14.994 --> 03:16.393
Of course it isn't.

03:18.064 --> 03:22.194
Computer, transfer all
Bridge logs to this station.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.735
Accessing Bridge logs.

03:23.803 --> 03:26.067
Replay last log entry.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.606
Heavy casualties...

03:27.674 --> 03:29.164
the warp core's going critical

03:29.242 --> 03:31.233
and the ejection system
is off-line.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.871
l've ordered all personnel
to abandon ship.

03:33.947 --> 03:35.209
Lieutenant Torres and l...

03:40.486 --> 03:43.649
Computer, have any escape pods
been ejected?

03:43.723 --> 03:47.215
All escape pods
were launched at 2100 hours.

03:47.293 --> 03:50.262
Scan the ship
for any humanoid life-forms.

03:50.330 --> 03:53.731
There are no humanoid
life-forms aboard this vessel.

03:53.800 --> 03:58.737
Well, l'm glad everyone bothered
to say good-bye.

04:10.383 --> 04:15.184
Chief Medical Officer's Log,
Stardate 48892.1.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.918
lt appears that Voyager
has suffered a... disaster.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.190
What kind l don't know,
but one thing is clear.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.629
The crew was forced
to abandon ship.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.798
lt would therefore seem

04:28.868 --> 04:31.063
that my usefulness
has come to an end.

04:31.137 --> 04:33.697
l am terminating my program.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.537
lf anyone finds this Log,
l can be reactivated by...

04:40.013 --> 04:40.980
Hello?!

04:56.195 --> 04:57.355
Hello?!

05:14.113 --> 05:16.707
Doctor!
What are you doing?!

05:16.783 --> 05:19.752
Sorry. l wasn't expecting
a member of the crew.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.287
The computer said
everyone had left.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.153
The internal sensors
were damaged during the attack.

05:25.224 --> 05:27.124
They must not be reading
every life sign on the ship.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.319
Attack?

05:28.394 --> 05:29.588
The Kazon.

05:29.662 --> 05:33.291
Two of their Predator-class
warships took us by surprise,

05:33.366 --> 05:35.800
hit us with a volley
of plasma torpedoes.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.632
lt started a core breach,
and we had to abandon ship.

05:38.705 --> 05:39.899
The Captain and l stayed behind

05:39.972 --> 05:41.405
to see if we could
stop the breach.

05:41.474 --> 05:43.169
At the last second, we did.

05:43.242 --> 05:45.574
Why didn't the crew
return to the ship?

05:45.645 --> 05:47.806
Because they couldn't.

05:47.880 --> 05:51.543
The Kazon tractored all
the life pods onto their ships.

05:51.617 --> 05:54.017
They went into warp
before we could stop them.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.316
What's wrong?

05:56.389 --> 05:59.324
This tricorder isn't
registering your life signs.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.360
This one isn't working either.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.093
You've got to help the Captain.

06:05.164 --> 06:07.291
She was hit
by a falling support beam.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.595
l didn't want
to risk moving her,

06:08.668 --> 06:10.465
so l had to leave her
on the Bridge.

06:10.536 --> 06:11.867
Can't we beam her to Sick Bay?

06:11.938 --> 06:13.565
The transporters are down,
so are the turbolifts.

06:13.639 --> 06:15.504
l had to crawl through
31 Jefferies tubes

06:15.575 --> 06:16.906
on five decks just to get here.

06:16.976 --> 06:17.908
Then you're going to have

06:17.977 --> 06:19.274
to go back up there
with a medical kit.

06:19.345 --> 06:20.471
l'll instruct you on how to...

06:20.546 --> 06:21.638
You don't understand, Doctor.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.705
l'm not going-- you are.

06:23.783 --> 06:25.546
l'm sending you to the Bridge.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.643
That would be ideal
if it were possible,

06:27.720 --> 06:29.654
but my projection
system is limited

06:29.722 --> 06:30.814
to the Sick Bay
and the holodecks.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.857
Not anymore.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.119
For the past few weeks,
we've been setting up

06:34.193 --> 06:36.525
holographic emitters
on critical decks.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.622
We were hoping to set up
a remote holo-projection system,

06:39.699 --> 06:41.326
give you access
to other parts of the ship.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.925
Why wasn't l told about this?

06:43.035 --> 06:44.627
We hadn't even tested
the system yet.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.695
There was no guarantee
it was going to work.

06:46.773 --> 06:47.740
l guess the Captain

06:47.807 --> 06:49.069
didn't want
to get your hopes up.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.076
Her compassion is heartwarming.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.442
The next time, l'd rather
be kept informed.

06:53.513 --> 06:55.447
Where are
these remote projectors?

06:55.515 --> 06:57.107
Decks 1 through 5.

06:57.183 --> 07:00.550
We also put them in Engineering,
the Mess Hall and the Cargo Bay.

07:00.620 --> 07:02.952
All the projectors are in place,

07:03.022 --> 07:05.855
but the problem is, we're
going to have to interface

07:05.925 --> 07:07.449
with the Sick Bay
imaging system.

07:07.527 --> 07:10.223
That's going to take a lot
of power and computer memory.

07:10.296 --> 07:13.561
l don't know if we have
enough reserve power to spare.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.100
Most of the crew is gone.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.966
Could we divert power
from life support systems?

07:18.037 --> 07:19.868
Good idea.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.371
l can drop life support down

07:21.441 --> 07:23.306
to minimum levels
on the lower decks.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.310
That should give us
enough power.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.539
All right, l'll need
another 20 minutes

07:27.613 --> 07:29.274
to get the projectors on line.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.217
All right.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.752
The remote projectors are
charged and ready to go.

07:44.831 --> 07:47.925
lmaging interface... stable.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.332
Are you ready to try this?

07:50.403 --> 07:52.735
l assume there's still
an emergency medical kit

07:52.805 --> 07:54.067
behind the Tactical console?

07:54.140 --> 07:55.107
That's right.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.300
Then l'm ready.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.809
There are a couple of things
you should know.

07:58.878 --> 07:59.845
ln order to do this,

07:59.912 --> 08:02.142
l had to recalibrate
your containment field,

08:02.248 --> 08:05.809
so your holo-matrix will be
very sensitive to disruption.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.116
Try to stay away
from energy discharges--

08:08.187 --> 08:10.951
phaser fire, force fields,
that sort of thing.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.820
-l'll try.
-Make sure you do,

08:12.892 --> 08:14.757
because, if your containment
field collapses,

08:14.827 --> 08:16.761
it'll take hours
to reinitialize your program.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.797
Understood.

08:19.799 --> 08:21.130
l'm going to head down
to Engineering

08:21.200 --> 08:23.191
and try to get some
of the critical systems working.

08:23.269 --> 08:26.204
You'll hear from me when l get
the com system back on line.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.638
Unless, of course,
this doesn't work,

08:28.708 --> 08:31.836
in which case, l'll see you
in about five seconds.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.111
Good luck, Doctor.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.842
Thank you.

08:36.916 --> 08:39.077
l have a feeling l'll need it.

08:50.429 --> 08:54.559
Well... it's bigger
than l thought.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.413
Captain?

09:45.384 --> 09:46.908
Hello, Captain.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.419
You're going to be fine.

09:48.487 --> 09:49.419
Oh, Doctor.

09:49.488 --> 09:52.218
l see the new holo-projectors
are working.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.418
Lieutenant Torres was able
to get them on line.

09:54.493 --> 09:57.929
Are you feeling any pain,
dizziness, nausea?

09:57.997 --> 09:59.487
l'm a little disoriented

09:59.565 --> 10:01.829
and l have
one hell of a headache.

10:01.901 --> 10:04.426
For some reason, none
of the tricorders are working,

10:04.503 --> 10:06.334
but, from what l can tell,
you have a concussion.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.896
l'd like to get you to Sick Bay
as soon as possible.

10:08.975 --> 10:12.240
The last thing l remember
is launching the escape pods.

10:12.311 --> 10:13.505
Lieutenant Torres and l

10:13.579 --> 10:15.513
were trying to stop
the core breach,

10:15.581 --> 10:16.912
and then l blacked out.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.417
You were successful in
preventing the breach.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.510
And the crew?

10:21.587 --> 10:24.647
They were taken prisoner
by the Kazon.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.715
Torres to Bridge.
Can you hear me?

10:26.792 --> 10:29.886
Yes, Lieutenant, we hear you.
Go ahead.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.190
Are you all right, Captain?

10:31.263 --> 10:33.629
Fine. l'm glad you
convinced the Doctor

10:33.699 --> 10:34.996
to make a house call.

10:35.067 --> 10:36.466
What's our status?

10:36.535 --> 10:38.730
l've got communications
back on line,

10:38.804 --> 10:41.739
and l think l can reactivate
the warp core, but it'll mean

10:41.807 --> 10:44.970
recrystallizing
the entire dilithium matrix.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.035
Keep on it.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.444
ln the meantime,

10:48.514 --> 10:50.573
l'll see if l can restore
the Bridge controls

10:50.650 --> 10:52.584
and start scanning
for the Kazon ships.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.812
Aye, Captain.
Torres out.

10:53.886 --> 10:56.821
Doctor, do you know anything
about bypassing a power relay?

10:56.889 --> 10:59.323
ls it anything
like a coronary bypass?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.859
Actually, it is.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.917
Give me a hand.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.860
See this conduit?

11:04.930 --> 11:06.158
lt's a power relay.

11:06.232 --> 11:07.631
lts circuits are burnt out.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.099
What we need to do
is reconfigure...

11:09.168 --> 11:12.194
Neelix to Bridge.
ls anyone there? Emergency.

11:12.271 --> 11:13.238
Neelix, this is the Captain.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.237
What's wrong?

11:14.306 --> 11:15.534
Help, l need help!

11:15.608 --> 11:16.700
l'm in the Mess Hall.
There's a...

11:17.777 --> 11:19.506
Neelix, are you there?

11:19.578 --> 11:20.977
Neelix!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.741
With the turbolifts down,

11:22.815 --> 11:24.783
it'll take me
a half hour to get there.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.875
Doctor...

11:26.952 --> 11:28.419
it's up to you.

11:28.487 --> 11:31.183
l'll use the remote projectors
to send you to the Mess Hall.

11:31.257 --> 11:32.724
Stand by for transfer.

11:37.296 --> 11:40.754
l hope that crushed your skull,
Kazon pus hog!

11:40.833 --> 11:42.323
Kazon?

11:43.602 --> 11:46.332
What's it like to stare
death in the face, Kazon?

12:06.292 --> 12:07.691
Missed me.

12:17.336 --> 12:20.328
l suggest
you surrender now, Kazon!

12:20.406 --> 12:22.101
The Captain's on her way.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.676
Gut spore!
You needle snake!

12:46.599 --> 12:47.793
My best sauté pan.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.232
Good work, Doctor.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.362
You're injured.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.231
What's wrong?
ls it serious?

12:56.308 --> 12:57.468
Don't panic, Mr. Neelix.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.340
lt looks superficial.

12:59.411 --> 13:00.537
Am l going to die?

13:00.646 --> 13:03.114
Not unless you're
allergic to tomatoes.

13:03.149 --> 13:04.116
That isn't blood.

13:04.183 --> 13:05.309
lt's some kind of sauce.

13:07.186 --> 13:10.178
Nondoran tomato paste.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.918
Ooh! That'll leave
a nasty stain.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.926
What are you doing here, Doctor?

13:14.994 --> 13:16.859
l could ask you the same thing.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.454
Kes and l were
on our way to the escape pod

13:19.532 --> 13:23.491
when this Kazon fungus came
crawling out an access hatch.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.935
l kept him occupied long
enough for Kes to get away,

13:26.038 --> 13:27.505
but he didn't give up so easily.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.562
So l took off running,

13:28.641 --> 13:30.233
he chased me,
and l led him here.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.176
No one gets the best of me
in my kitchen!

13:34.747 --> 13:36.237
l'm fine now.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.476
The question is, are you?

13:38.551 --> 13:39.745
Me?

13:39.819 --> 13:41.309
You're bleeding.

13:41.387 --> 13:43.480
Bleeding?

13:43.556 --> 13:45.387
That's impossible.

13:48.694 --> 13:49.820
Don't panic, Doctor.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.590
lt looks superficial.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.123
l'm not programmed to bleed.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.999
Maybe you should
check your program.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.199
Emergency Medical Hologram
to Captain Janeway.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.572
Go ahead, Doctor.

14:04.643 --> 14:06.076
Captain, we've captured a Kazon.

14:06.145 --> 14:09.308
He's been rendered unconscious
and Mr. Neelix is fine.

14:09.381 --> 14:11.815
But l believe my program
is malfunctioning.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.681
l request that you return me
to Sick Bay immediately.

14:13.752 --> 14:14.684
Acknowledged.

14:14.753 --> 14:15.685
Mr. Neelix,

14:15.754 --> 14:17.585
keep an eye on the Kazon
until l get there.

14:17.656 --> 14:18.645
l'm on my way.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.191
No problem, Captain.

14:33.806 --> 14:35.899
Pain?

14:35.975 --> 14:38.341
l'm not programmed to feel pain.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.382
Heart rate?

14:47.453 --> 14:48.886
Blood pressure?

14:48.954 --> 14:51.013
Brain patterns?

14:54.727 --> 14:58.493
Computer, analyze emergency
medical holographic program.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.965
Has it been altered in any way
to include... life signs?

15:02.034 --> 15:03.592
Unable to comply.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.864
Requested program
is not on file.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.438
Not on file?

15:07.506 --> 15:10.168
The program's running right now.

15:12.311 --> 15:16.304
Display schematics for all
Sick Bay holographic systems.

15:16.382 --> 15:19.249
No holographic systems
exist in Sick Bay.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.554
EMH Program AK-1

15:23.622 --> 15:26.785
Diagnostic and Surgical
Subroutine Omega 323.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.884
Check the database
and you'll find it.

15:28.961 --> 15:31.521
Specified program
does not exist.

15:33.866 --> 15:35.026
Well, then, who is

15:35.100 --> 15:37.398
the Chief Medical Officer
on board this ship?

15:37.469 --> 15:40.336
The Chief Medical Officer
of USS Voyager

15:40.406 --> 15:42.374
is Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.309
Lewis Zimmerman?

15:45.377 --> 15:48.904
Yes. He was the engineer
who created my program.

15:48.981 --> 15:52.382
l understand he resembles me,
but he's not on Voyager.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.318
He's at the Jupiter Station
Holo-programming Center.

15:57.156 --> 16:01.092
Computer, how long
has Doctor Zimmerman

16:01.160 --> 16:02.855
served on Voyager?.

16:02.928 --> 16:08.264
Dr. Zimmerman commenced duty
on stardate 48308.2.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.667
48308...

16:11.737 --> 16:14.865
That's the date l was activated.

16:14.974 --> 16:21.777
Computer, display all Starfleet
records on Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.383
He looks a lot like me.

16:25.451 --> 16:27.715
ln fact,
he looks exactly like me.

16:27.786 --> 16:30.516
Computer, is this me?

16:30.589 --> 16:33.217
Affirmative.
Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

16:34.460 --> 16:37.088
Doctor, we've almost got
the warp core back on line,

16:37.162 --> 16:39.027
but we need to know
where the crew was taken.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.157
l want you
to perform an ARA scan

16:41.233 --> 16:43.030
on the Kazon
while we question him.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.270
ls something wrong?

16:45.337 --> 16:47.931
Something's very wrong.

16:48.007 --> 16:53.240
These tricorders aren't picking
up any of your life signs.

16:53.312 --> 16:56.543
At first, l thought
they were malfunctioning,

16:56.615 --> 16:58.549
but now l find they show me

16:58.617 --> 17:02.348
to be a living, breathing,
bleeding human being.

17:02.421 --> 17:03.547
What?

17:03.622 --> 17:05.089
And that's not all.

17:05.156 --> 17:07.387
According to the computer,
l'm not a hologram.

17:07.459 --> 17:10.394
l'm a real person
named ''Zimmerman.''

17:10.462 --> 17:12.259
l've been trying
to analyze my program,

17:12.330 --> 17:14.060
but the computer
says it doesn't exist.

17:14.133 --> 17:17.397
This could be a problem
with the remote projectors.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.733
The multiple holographic signals
may be confusing the computer.

17:20.806 --> 17:22.433
l'm going to deactivate you

17:22.508 --> 17:25.238
and then reinitialize
your program parameters.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.677
Computer, discontinue emergency
medical holographic system.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.644
See what l mean?

17:33.318 --> 17:34.342
You're right.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.911
Your program's
not anywhere on file.

17:37.022 --> 17:41.220
Computer, shut down
all holographic systems

17:41.293 --> 17:42.783
throughout the ship.

17:56.442 --> 18:00.208
Computer, what happened
to Captain Janeway

18:00.279 --> 18:02.941
Lieutenant Torres, Mr. Neelix
and the Kazon?

18:03.015 --> 18:06.075
All holographic simulations
were discontinued.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.847
Simulations?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.856
Computer, l'm talking
about real people.

18:11.957 --> 18:15.222
Locate Captain Janeway.

18:15.294 --> 18:19.663
Captain Janeway is stored
in memory block 47-alpha.

18:19.731 --> 18:23.531
List all other programs
stored in that memory block.

18:27.372 --> 18:30.205
This is
the entire Voyager crew.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.402
Computer, are you saying
that the crew is nothing more

18:32.478 --> 18:34.207
than a collection
of holographic programs?

18:34.279 --> 18:36.008
Affirmative.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.345
This is ridiculous.

18:38.417 --> 18:42.012
There must be something wrong.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.282
Doctor, am l glad to see you.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.880
Can you see me?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.256
Of course l can see you.
Who are you?

18:48.327 --> 18:50.625
Sir, it-it's me.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.856
lt's Lieutenant Barclay.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.397
Reg... your assistant.

18:53.465 --> 18:55.194
My assistant's name is Kes.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.234
Who are you?

18:56.301 --> 18:57.233
Uh-oh.

18:57.302 --> 18:58.394
What?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.438
Oh, no.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.996
This is bad.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.542
This is... this is very bad.

19:09.047 --> 19:11.675
Don't panic.

19:13.919 --> 19:18.322
Uh... let's just try
to think our way through this.

19:18.390 --> 19:20.051
l'm not familiar with you.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.854
Are you a member
of the Voyager crew,

19:21.960 --> 19:24.053
or have we encountered
another Federation ship?

19:24.129 --> 19:25.960
Oh, boy!

19:26.031 --> 19:27.965
The Voyager.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.432
Oh, boy!

19:29.501 --> 19:33.528
This is going to sound
a little crazy

19:33.605 --> 19:37.132
from your perspective,
but you've got to trust me.

19:40.279 --> 19:42.543
None of this is happening.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.879
This is all
a holographic simulation

19:45.951 --> 19:47.680
that you've been running.

19:47.753 --> 19:49.084
What are you talking about?

19:49.154 --> 19:51.850
You're in the holodeck
at the Jupiter Station.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.722
Your name
is Dr. Lewis Zimmerman.

19:54.793 --> 19:57.387
You're a holo-engineer
and you've been running

19:57.462 --> 20:00.522
a program that's malfunctioning
and we've been trying

20:00.599 --> 20:02.089
to reach you.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.794
What are you saying--

20:03.869 --> 20:07.396
that l'm a... real person?

20:07.573 --> 20:09.905
Well, l always used
to think of you that way

20:09.975 --> 20:12.034
and l-l know
your wife tends to think...

20:12.110 --> 20:13.509
My wife?

20:13.579 --> 20:16.309
We'd, uh...

20:16.381 --> 20:18.440
we'd better take this
one step at a time.

20:18.517 --> 20:19.609
Please do.

20:19.685 --> 20:23.280
Well, uh, you see,
this, uh, starship--

20:23.355 --> 20:25.289
it's not really a starship.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.587
lt was a program that you wrote

20:27.659 --> 20:30.492
to study
the psychological impact

20:30.562 --> 20:34.589
of long-term isolation
on a crew

20:34.666 --> 20:37.829
made up of Starfleet
and Maquis crew members.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.564
A program l wrote?

20:39.638 --> 20:40.832
That's preposterous.

20:40.906 --> 20:41.895
l'm the program.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.465
Voyager is a real ship,
manned by real people.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.374
l'm afraid not.

20:46.445 --> 20:50.575
This must have something to do
with the radiation surge.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.741
What was that?

20:51.817 --> 20:54.650
Well, we've been having problems
shutting the program down

20:54.720 --> 20:58.747
because of a kinoplasmic
radiation surge on the station.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.382
lt's affected
all of the computer systems--

21:00.459 --> 21:02.484
including the holodecks.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.724
The radiation must be affecting

21:05.797 --> 21:08.027
the memory centers
of your brain.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.095
How did you get in here?

21:11.169 --> 21:12.363
Oh, l'm not really here.

21:12.437 --> 21:16.430
Clearly, l'm here
because we're talking.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.305
You see, what l mean is,

21:18.377 --> 21:21.346
l'm in a control booth
outside of the holodeck.

21:21.413 --> 21:25.907
What you see
is a projection of my body,

21:25.984 --> 21:27.349
so that we can communicate.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.979
We've been trying to get in here
or send a com signal in

21:30.055 --> 21:30.987
for nearly six hours.

21:31.089 --> 21:32.556
You expect me to believe

21:32.624 --> 21:35.525
that the past six months
l've spent on this ship

21:35.594 --> 21:36.993
have been nothing
but a simulation?

21:37.062 --> 21:38.962
You haven't been here
six months.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.931
You've only been here six hours.

21:40.999 --> 21:42.227
That's impossible.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.293
l have very clear memories of
my first appearance on Voyager,

21:45.370 --> 21:47.235
meeting Captain Janeway
for the first time--

21:47.306 --> 21:49.206
l've had numerous experiences
aboard this ship.

21:49.274 --> 21:51.003
That's all part
of the simulation.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.737
How do l know
you're not some type of alien

21:53.812 --> 21:55.780
impersonating
a Starfleet officer?

21:55.847 --> 21:59.977
Look, Doctor, it's
very important

22:00.052 --> 22:01.485
that you believe me.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.511
You're losing
your sense of identity.

22:03.555 --> 22:06.023
You're starting to think
that you're part of the program

22:06.091 --> 22:09.060
and that's... that's not good.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.493
lt's called HTDS--

22:11.563 --> 22:13.554
holo-transference
dementia syndrome.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.600
So now l'm having
a psychotic episode.

22:15.667 --> 22:19.763
No. Yes! l mean,
maybe the radiation...

22:19.838 --> 22:21.806
Doctor, l'm sorry
l have to do this.

22:22.808 --> 22:24.298
How dare you?

22:24.376 --> 22:26.241
lt hurt, right?

22:26.311 --> 22:29.371
lf you were a program,
it wouldn't hurt.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.473
l-l could be programmed
to think it hurt.

22:31.550 --> 22:32.517
Doctor!

22:33.552 --> 22:34.678
l'll be back.

22:36.955 --> 22:38.946
l've got to discuss this
with the others.

22:39.024 --> 22:41.515
Don't... don't go anywhere.

22:45.063 --> 22:46.530
Pain.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.694
Pain.
Why would l have pain?

22:53.905 --> 22:55.668
l think l'm hungry.

22:55.741 --> 22:59.268
l'm not sure what for,
but l'm definitely hungry.

22:59.344 --> 23:01.710
This is impossible.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.847
The problem is worse
than we thought.

23:06.918 --> 23:10.251
The, uh, radiation is
disrupting the command protocol,

23:10.322 --> 23:12.449
so we can't
shut the program down

23:12.524 --> 23:14.151
and while the program
is running,

23:14.226 --> 23:16.694
we can't access
the holodeck grid.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.730
Why don't you
beam me out of here?

23:18.797 --> 23:20.924
We tried, but the radiation

23:20.999 --> 23:22.830
is interfering
with the transporters

23:22.901 --> 23:24.562
and we can't get a lock on you.

23:24.636 --> 23:28.595
l've consulted with our
neurologist, Dr. Kaplan,

23:28.673 --> 23:31.233
and he said that if we
can't get you out of here

23:31.309 --> 23:32.799
within the next hour,
that the radiation

23:32.878 --> 23:36.871
would completely oxidize
your neuro-cellular structures.

23:38.016 --> 23:40.985
So, what do you suggest?

23:41.052 --> 23:43.850
There's only one way left
to terminate the program

23:43.922 --> 23:45.184
and that's to play it out.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.351
Bring it to its conclusion,
and once the simulation ends,

23:48.427 --> 23:51.828
it'll release the access locks
on the holodeck arch,

23:51.897 --> 23:53.626
and we can get you out of here.

23:53.698 --> 23:57.259
How does it conclude?

23:57.335 --> 24:00.702
You programmed
two possible outcomes--

24:00.772 --> 24:03.639
either Voyager finds its way
back to Federation space

24:03.708 --> 24:05.869
or it's destroyed
in the process.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.311
But the simulation
was designed to run for weeks

24:09.381 --> 24:12.350
before either happens.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.578
But l know of a way

24:14.653 --> 24:17.053
that you can bring it
to an end right now.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.783
Destroy the ship.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.791
Destroy the ship?

24:20.859 --> 24:22.827
Destroy Voyager?.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.454
This is just a simulation,
Lewis.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.794
None of this is real

24:27.866 --> 24:33.270
and unless you destroy this ship
that you think you're on,

24:33.338 --> 24:34.965
you're going to die.

24:44.216 --> 24:47.151
No. No, absolutely not.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.346
Doctor, it's the only way.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.788
First of all, l don't even know
how to destroy the ship.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.655
Second of all, l wouldn't
do it even if l could.

24:54.726 --> 24:57.251
And third, how do l know
you're not an alien intruder

24:57.329 --> 24:59.388
trying to trick me
into killing everyone?

24:59.464 --> 25:02.228
Well... those are
good questions.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.738
First, l can tell you
how to destroy the Voyager.

25:07.806 --> 25:10.673
Second, if you don't do it,
you're going to die.

25:10.742 --> 25:14.075
And third...
well, l'm just not an alien

25:14.145 --> 25:16.545
and l don't know how else
to convince you of that.

25:16.615 --> 25:20.142
lf what you're saying is true,
why don't you destroy the ship?

25:20.218 --> 25:21.446
Why do l have to do it?

25:21.520 --> 25:23.283
You're the one running
the simulation.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.916
lt's coded to respond
to your input, not mine.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.652
l'm sorry, Mr. Barclay--

25:28.727 --> 25:30.319
if that's what your name
really is--

25:30.395 --> 25:32.260
but you're not very convincing.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.491
Here. Use this tricorder.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.966
Scan the room out
to a distance of 15 meters.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.537
This appears to show
a wall 15 meters away

25:43.608 --> 25:45.405
and it does have a holodeck
grid configuration.

25:45.477 --> 25:46.444
You see?

25:46.511 --> 25:47.944
But you could be manipulating
these readings.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.344
Scan me!

25:49.414 --> 25:51.712
You'll see
l'm a holographic projection

25:51.783 --> 25:53.648
originating
from beyond that wall.

25:55.320 --> 25:56.753
Yes. All right.

25:56.821 --> 25:59.790
But it could still be
an elaborate deception.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.553
l can't take that risk.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.594
There has to be some way
to convince you.

26:05.797 --> 26:07.958
Oh, l know.
l'll be right back.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.169
Orderly! Here.

26:14.205 --> 26:16.264
Are you the Emergency
Medical Hologram?

26:16.341 --> 26:17.365
Yes, of course l am.

26:17.442 --> 26:18.909
Well, we've got wounded here.

26:23.615 --> 26:25.515
l've seen this patient before.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.279
He has multiple
percussive injuries.

26:27.352 --> 26:28.319
Tricorder.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.589
Medical tricorder.

26:34.759 --> 26:35.885
l've been in this moment
in time before.

26:35.961 --> 26:36.893
What?

26:36.962 --> 26:39.021
What are you talking about?
Help this man.

26:39.097 --> 26:40.894
Have we just been catapulted
across the galaxy

26:40.966 --> 26:42.593
to an unknown area
of the Delta Quadrant?

26:42.667 --> 26:44.498
-Yes.
-And you are developing

26:44.569 --> 26:45.797
tumorous growths on your chest.

26:45.870 --> 26:47.167
-What?
-Ah, so...

26:47.238 --> 26:48.728
that hasn't happened yet.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.206
ls this stardate 48308?

26:50.275 --> 26:52.243
Look, are you going
to help this man or not?

26:52.310 --> 26:53.242
l'm not.

26:53.311 --> 26:54.369
Mr. Barclay.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.606
The program must
be malfunctioning.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.843
Let me see if l can reset
the holographic projector.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.714
Mr. Barclay,
will you please return?

27:00.819 --> 27:02.150
Now do you believe me?

27:02.187 --> 27:04.849
This is the beginning
of the simulation.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.423
We can't shut down the program,

27:06.491 --> 27:07.549
but we can restart it.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.197
This is my first memory
of being activated on Voyager.

27:13.264 --> 27:14.856
Who the hell are you?!

27:14.933 --> 27:18.369
Did l program Mr. Paris
to be so annoying?

27:18.436 --> 27:19.869
Actually, l programmed him.

27:19.938 --> 27:21.872
l modeled him
after my cousin Frank.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.465
Hmm...
Computer, delete Paris.

27:25.543 --> 27:26.942
What are you...?

27:29.581 --> 27:30.605
What did you do to him?

27:30.682 --> 27:32.650
Computer, delete Kim.

27:33.718 --> 27:34.912
Hmm.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.613
Are you convinced yet?

27:36.688 --> 27:39.919
Let's just say that your
credibility level is rising,

27:40.025 --> 27:42.721
but l'm still not prepared
to destroy Voyager.

27:42.794 --> 27:45.319
So what are you going to do now?

27:45.397 --> 27:48.696
l need to confirm
my true nature--

27:48.767 --> 27:52.362
whether or not l am
in fact a real person.

27:53.972 --> 27:55.803
Let's just say that l'm right

27:55.874 --> 27:58.035
and this is a real ship,
and l'm a hologram.

27:58.109 --> 28:00.577
lf l were to destroy the
holographic memory core,

28:00.645 --> 28:02.408
then l should disappear.

28:02.480 --> 28:05.608
Yes, but if you destroy it
and you're still here...

28:05.684 --> 28:07.379
Then l'm not a hologram.

28:07.452 --> 28:09.010
And you'll know that l'm
telling you the truth.

28:09.087 --> 28:10.281
And you'll know that l'm
telling you the truth.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.380
The holo-memory core is
located in Engineering.

28:12.457 --> 28:13.981
Let's go.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.393
What's wrong?

28:18.463 --> 28:21.125
The remote holo-projectors
were taken off line.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.861
l shouldn't be able
to exist outside Sick Bay.

28:23.968 --> 28:25.299
That's because you're a...

28:25.370 --> 28:28.134
A real person. Yes.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.902
l'm getting the idea.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.211
Magnetic constrictors
are on line.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.338
The warp core is stable.

28:36.414 --> 28:39.383
Let's get started
on those plasma relays.

28:39.451 --> 28:40.884
You-- who are you?

28:40.952 --> 28:42.749
l'm the Emergency
Medical Hologram.

28:42.821 --> 28:45.119
l didn't know you could be
projected into Engineering.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.623
l can't,
but it's a long story.

28:46.691 --> 28:48.056
l'd rather not get
into it right now.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.754
Fine. We have three wounded
crew members over here.

28:50.829 --> 28:52.262
l'm afraid l have
a more pressing matter

28:52.330 --> 28:53.262
to attend to, Captain.

28:53.331 --> 28:54.696
What do you mean, you have

28:54.766 --> 28:56.757
a more pressing matter
to attend to?

28:56.835 --> 28:57.824
And who are you?

28:57.902 --> 28:58.869
l don't recognize you.

28:58.937 --> 28:59.904
Oh, don't mind me.

28:59.971 --> 29:01.563
l'm just assisting the Doctor.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.072
Doctor, l am ordering you

29:03.108 --> 29:04.769
to take care
of these wounded crew members.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.811
Computer, delete Janeway.

29:08.279 --> 29:10.247
The program's not responding
to vocal commands.

29:10.315 --> 29:11.748
The protocols are
starting to freeze up.

29:11.816 --> 29:12.805
We don't have much time.

29:12.951 --> 29:16.512
Jarvis, Parsons,
put these men under arrest.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.715
Don't worry.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.280
Those phasers aren't real.
They're just holograms.

29:20.358 --> 29:21.290
l wouldn't be so sure.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.657
l was injured earlier.

29:23.728 --> 29:25.525
That means
the holodeck safeties are off.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.258
Now just a moment.

29:27.332 --> 29:28.959
Let's not do anything hasty.

29:29.033 --> 29:30.364
Who are you?

29:30.435 --> 29:32.995
Are you two responsible
for bringing us here?

29:33.071 --> 29:35.631
Actually, no.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.608
The Array you discovered
is controlled by an entity

29:38.676 --> 29:40.303
you will come to know
as the Caretaker

29:40.378 --> 29:42.243
or banjo-man.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.873
He's actually an alien life-form
who is caring for a species

29:44.983 --> 29:46.416
known as the Ocampa,
who live nearby.

29:46.484 --> 29:48.008
Enough.

29:48.086 --> 29:49.781
l don't know
what this is all about,

29:49.854 --> 29:52.015
but clearly, you're involved.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.455
Take them to the brig.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.822
l'll question them later.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.724
Mm, no, l don't think so.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.524
You're in no position to argue.

29:58.596 --> 29:59.528
l'm not arguing.

29:59.597 --> 30:01.258
l'm simply pointing out
that in several seconds,

30:01.332 --> 30:02.264
the entire crew of Voyager

30:02.333 --> 30:03.664
will be transported
to the Array,

30:03.735 --> 30:05.100
where you will be tortured

30:05.170 --> 30:06.933
and probed
for medical information.

30:07.005 --> 30:09.132
lt will be quite painful,
but not fatal.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.469
Bridge to Janeway.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.510
We're being scanned
by the Array, Captain.

30:12.577 --> 30:13.908
lt's penetrated our shields.

30:13.978 --> 30:15.036
What kind of scan?

30:15.113 --> 30:16.512
Bridge?

30:16.581 --> 30:18.412
Janeway to Bridge.
Respond.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.276
What are you...?

30:24.289 --> 30:26.314
Time is running out, Doctor.

30:26.391 --> 30:27.449
The oxidation levels

30:27.525 --> 30:29.959
in your neural tissues
are rising.

30:30.028 --> 30:31.518
You've got to destroy this ship

30:31.596 --> 30:33.257
and bring this program
to an end.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.593
First things first.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.567
l have to make absolutely
sure what l am.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.571
This is the central memory nexus

30:50.648 --> 30:52.809
for all holographic systems
on board.

30:52.884 --> 30:54.374
lf l destroy this,

30:54.452 --> 30:56.511
there won't be a single
hologram left on Voyager.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.919
Well, except for me.

30:57.989 --> 31:00.048
l'm being projected
from outside the simulation.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.322
Go ahead.

31:05.396 --> 31:06.556
Give it a try.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.278
Convinced?

31:26.284 --> 31:28.445
Computer, what is the status

31:28.519 --> 31:30.749
of the holographic
imaging system on Voyager?.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.848
The holographic imaging system
has been destroyed.

31:33.925 --> 31:35.483
Are there
any holographic programs

31:35.560 --> 31:36.925
running anywhere on the ship?

31:36.995 --> 31:38.155
Negative.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.823
Then why is the ship still
here and not a holo-grid?

31:40.899 --> 31:42.833
Please restate the question.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.495
You said all holo-systems
were destroyed.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.629
Why is the ship simulation
still running?!

31:47.705 --> 31:50.435
All holo-simulations
have been terminated.

31:50.508 --> 31:54.239
Doctor, l-l know this
is a little confusing,

31:54.312 --> 31:56.576
but try to remember
that you just destroyed

31:56.648 --> 31:59.845
the holographic imaging system
on a holographic ship--

31:59.918 --> 32:01.579
a hologram in a hologram.

32:01.686 --> 32:03.449
lf you want
to bring this to an end,

32:03.488 --> 32:05.547
you've got to destroy
the entire simulation--

32:05.623 --> 32:07.056
the ship itself.

32:10.194 --> 32:11.821
Then it's true.

32:11.896 --> 32:16.299
l am... a real person.

32:16.367 --> 32:18.767
And you're a person
in great danger.

32:18.836 --> 32:23.102
Destroy the ship
now, before it's too late.

32:24.742 --> 32:27.210
But if l'm wrong...

32:27.278 --> 32:28.905
Doctor, you've got
to believe me.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.948
What else can l do
to prove it to you?

32:31.015 --> 32:33.643
l know, l know,
but it's just so...

32:34.752 --> 32:36.447
There.

32:36.521 --> 32:38.989
You see what's happening?

32:39.057 --> 32:41.252
Holograms don't feel pain.

32:41.326 --> 32:45.695
Your brain is being flooded
with kinoplasmic radiation.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.458
You're dying.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.990
l... l guess you're right.

32:51.069 --> 32:52.127
Oh...!

32:54.872 --> 32:56.134
What should l do?

32:56.207 --> 32:57.834
The warp core.

33:02.046 --> 33:03.411
Even set on full power,

33:03.481 --> 33:05.449
it's going to take
a sustained phaser burst

33:05.516 --> 33:07.575
to punch through
the outer duranium shielding.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.916
Set your phaser to maximum.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.821
Aim for the magnetic
constrictors.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.691
Ready?

33:16.761 --> 33:17.921
Ready.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.293
Stop!

33:19.364 --> 33:21.332
Doctor, don't listen to him.

33:21.399 --> 33:22.832
He's lying.

33:29.307 --> 33:30.569
Step away from the warp core,
Doctor.

33:30.641 --> 33:32.268
Don't do anything
that man tells you.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.571
You're in danger if you do.

33:33.644 --> 33:34.702
None of this is real.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.838
So l've been told.

33:36.914 --> 33:39.246
lt's all
a holographic simulation.

33:39.317 --> 33:42.718
That's right, but it's not
the simulation you think it is.

33:42.787 --> 33:45.517
Everything around you is part
of a holographic projection

33:45.590 --> 33:47.353
that's being created
by your program.

33:47.425 --> 33:48.357
My program?

33:48.426 --> 33:50.986
You're on the holodeck
on Voyager.

33:51.062 --> 33:53.087
The Captain suggested
you take a day off,

33:53.164 --> 33:54.563
try a holonovel, so you did.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.896
But while you were running
the holonovel,

33:56.968 --> 33:58.560
there was a kinoplasmic
radiation surge

33:58.636 --> 33:59.568
in the imaging system.

33:59.637 --> 34:01.867
lt created a feedback loop
between

34:01.973 --> 34:04.669
the holodeck computer
and your program.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.303
All of this,
including Mr. Barclay,

34:07.378 --> 34:09.471
is a holographic simulation

34:09.547 --> 34:12.141
generated by your codes,
subroutines

34:12.216 --> 34:13.342
and memory circuits.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.012
Don't be distracted by these
holographic characters.

34:16.087 --> 34:18.920
Stay focused
on what you need to do--

34:18.989 --> 34:21.185
destroy the warp core.

34:23.761 --> 34:25.228
Wait a minute.

34:25.295 --> 34:28.322
The entire crew of Voyager
was just taken by the Array.

34:28.399 --> 34:29.922
They won't be back
for three days.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.366
So what's he doing here?

34:31.436 --> 34:32.926
The program is malfunctioning.

34:33.036 --> 34:36.199
Are you the real
Commander Chakotay

34:36.274 --> 34:39.869
or a holographic projection
like Mr. Barclay?

34:39.944 --> 34:41.138
l'm a projection.

34:41.212 --> 34:44.112
l'm really at the holographic
control station in Engineering.

34:44.181 --> 34:45.911
You're trapped on the holodeck.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.882
We've been monitoring
the program from here

34:47.952 --> 34:49.943
and we've been trying
to reach you for hours.

34:50.021 --> 34:51.851
Sounds familiar.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.254
He told me the same thing.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.690
Doctor, do you remember
coming into the holodeck

34:55.760 --> 34:58.729
and running a holonovel
within the last six hours?

34:58.796 --> 35:00.525
No.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.895
No, l don't.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.434
That's because
your memory circuits

35:04.502 --> 35:06.231
are being eradicated
by the feedback loop.

35:06.304 --> 35:07.794
We have to get you
off the holodeck.

35:07.872 --> 35:09.737
Transfer you back to Sick Bay.

35:09.807 --> 35:12.071
You don't have memory circuits.

35:12.143 --> 35:15.135
You have a mind,
and it's being damaged.

35:15.213 --> 35:17.613
Destroy the Voyager,
the program will end

35:17.682 --> 35:20.082
and we can get you
off the holodeck.

35:20.151 --> 35:21.846
That's not true, Doctor.

35:21.919 --> 35:23.784
Because of the feedback loop,

35:23.855 --> 35:26.915
if you destroy the simulation,
you will be destroyed as well.

35:26.991 --> 35:28.754
Me?

35:28.826 --> 35:30.418
lf you shut down
this simulation,

35:30.495 --> 35:32.929
your program will be wiped out
right along with it.

35:32.997 --> 35:35.659
There'll be no way
to retrieve the lost data.

35:35.733 --> 35:37.291
You'll be gone.

35:39.604 --> 35:41.504
Oh...

35:43.274 --> 35:45.538
Only real people
experience pain.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.339
You've got to believe me.

35:47.411 --> 35:49.936
What you're perceiving as pain
is really the feedback loop

35:50.047 --> 35:51.571
eradicating
your memory circuits.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.313
What...

35:58.389 --> 36:00.220
what is it you want me to do?

36:00.324 --> 36:01.256
Don't do anything.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.283
We're working on the
problem right now.

36:03.361 --> 36:04.419
We're close to a solution.

36:04.495 --> 36:08.488
Do nothing and you'll die.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.026
Doctor...

36:13.104 --> 36:14.036
trust me.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.665
Trust me, Lewis.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.299
Kes?

36:18.376 --> 36:20.367
Yes, you know me.

36:20.444 --> 36:21.775
You remember me.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.370
Yes.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.506
You're my assistant.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.914
l told you.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.508
His brain is being damaged.

36:28.586 --> 36:29.917
He's losing his memory.

36:29.987 --> 36:34.321
This is Kes Zimmerman,
your wife.

36:34.392 --> 36:37.293
This is all
a holographic delusion

36:37.361 --> 36:38.692
drawn from people
and experiences

36:38.763 --> 36:39.923
in your own memory circuits.

36:39.997 --> 36:41.487
You are malfunctioning.

36:41.566 --> 36:44.057
Lewis, please, listen to Reg.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.693
He's trying to help you.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.601
Destroy this program.

36:47.672 --> 36:51.039
lf you listen to her, you'll
end up destroying yourself.

36:51.108 --> 36:53.770
Believe in yourself.

36:53.844 --> 36:55.368
You're not a program.

36:55.446 --> 36:59.109
You're a real,
flesh-and-blood human being...

36:59.183 --> 37:00.241
and you're my husband.

37:00.351 --> 37:03.479
l don't want to lose you.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.181
Lewis...

37:08.259 --> 37:11.319
how would you rather
think of yourself--

37:11.395 --> 37:14.193
as a real person
with a real life

37:14.265 --> 37:16.233
with a family that loves you,

37:16.300 --> 37:22.830
or as some hologram
that exists in a Sick Bay

37:22.907 --> 37:27.276
on a starship
lost in deep space?

37:27.345 --> 37:28.869
This isn't about what you want.

37:28.980 --> 37:31.813
This is about what you are.

37:31.882 --> 37:34.680
Just because you're made
of projected light and energy

37:34.752 --> 37:35.912
doesn't mean
you're any less real

37:35.987 --> 37:37.420
than someone made
of flesh and blood.

37:37.488 --> 37:39.615
lt doesn't matter
what you're made of.

37:39.690 --> 37:43.091
What matters is who you are.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.355
You're our friend.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.761
And we want you back.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.299
Lewis, please.

37:49.367 --> 37:50.925
Pick up the phaser.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.129
Destroy the warp core.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.637
lt's your only hope.

37:58.609 --> 37:59.701
Doctor...

37:59.777 --> 38:02.405
we're close
to getting you out of here.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.105
Try to hold on.

38:09.620 --> 38:11.645
Whatever happens,

38:11.722 --> 38:14.748
l just want you to know
l love you.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.195
l...

38:19.263 --> 38:22.061
l always wanted to tell you,
Kes...

38:25.970 --> 38:28.336
that you're beautiful.

38:30.107 --> 38:32.166
Thank you.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.878
What's going on?

38:41.986 --> 38:44.454
We were able to shut down
the holodeck simulation

38:44.522 --> 38:46.046
that your program
was generating.

38:46.123 --> 38:48.819
Commander Chakotay transferred
you back to Sick Bay.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.123
You seem to have
suffered no damage.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.124
What really happened?

38:55.199 --> 38:57.030
Voyager encountered
a subspace anomaly,

38:57.101 --> 38:59.262
which created
a kinoplasmic radiation surge

38:59.337 --> 39:00.929
throughout
most of our computers.

39:01.038 --> 39:02.528
Unfortunately, it happened

39:02.573 --> 39:04.507
while you were
using the holodeck.

39:04.575 --> 39:07.203
We've been working
for the past six hours

39:07.278 --> 39:08.939
to get you out of there.

39:10.081 --> 39:12.140
So, there was never
a Kazon attack.

39:12.216 --> 39:13.342
That's right.

39:13.417 --> 39:15.248
And the crew didn't really
abandon ship.

39:15.319 --> 39:18.049
No. ln fact, except
for the computer problems,

39:18.122 --> 39:20.022
it has been an uneventful day.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.996
And who is this Lieutenant
Barclay l imagined?

39:26.063 --> 39:27.826
Barclay was part
of the original engineering team

39:27.898 --> 39:29.058
that designed your program.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.998
He was in charge of testing
your interpersonal skills.

39:34.338 --> 39:36.670
Oh.

39:36.741 --> 39:39.505
This should make
an interesting paper.

39:39.577 --> 39:40.669
Chakotay to Sick Bay.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.372
ls the Doctor all right?

39:42.446 --> 39:43.413
Yes, Commander.

39:43.481 --> 39:45.449
His program is
functioning normally.

39:45.516 --> 39:46.483
Good work.

39:46.550 --> 39:47.915
As soon as you're
finished there,

39:48.018 --> 39:50.384
l want all senior officers
to report to the Bridge.

39:50.454 --> 39:52.285
Acknowledged.

39:52.356 --> 39:53.880
lt's good to have you back,
Doctor.

39:55.860 --> 39:58.192
Well... l suppose
l should begin cataloguing

39:58.262 --> 40:01.425
the niotrinate samples
l was working on this morning.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.171
So you really think
l'm beautiful.

40:10.241 --> 40:14.371
l was under a great deal
of stress, you understand.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.776
l may have said things

40:15.846 --> 40:18.440
that are not necessarily
my true feelings.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.984
Oh.

40:21.051 --> 40:23.383
Then you don't think
l'm beautiful.

40:23.454 --> 40:25.422
l didn't say that, exactly.

40:25.489 --> 40:28.481
l... l consider you very...

40:28.559 --> 40:32.222
very attractive...
in a platonic sense.

40:32.296 --> 40:34.890
l see.

40:34.965 --> 40:38.332
Then you don't really love me?

40:38.402 --> 40:40.996
l'm afraid not.

40:48.946 --> 40:51.312
Then l guess
our marriage is over.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.145
Our marriage?

40:53.217 --> 40:55.913
Are you making a joke?

40:55.986 --> 40:58.181
lt isn't a joke to me, Lewis.

40:58.255 --> 41:01.691
l know we have problems,
but l think we can solve them.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.056
No.

41:04.094 --> 41:07.063
No... this-this can't be right.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.723
Something's wrong here.

41:08.799 --> 41:10.562
lt's not too late, Lewis.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.829
You can still save yourself
by destroying the warp core.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.097
No...

41:15.840 --> 41:16.898
No, l don't believe you.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.908
None of this is real--
it's all a delusion.

41:18.976 --> 41:19.908
Somebody help me!

41:19.977 --> 41:21.672
l am helping you.

41:21.745 --> 41:22.712
Listen to him, Lewis.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.270
No!

41:29.420 --> 41:31.320
Doctor, are you
listening to me?!

41:31.388 --> 41:32.787
That man needs help!

41:37.862 --> 41:40.763
Try to calm down, Doctor.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.696
Everything's going to be fine.

41:44.969 --> 41:46.664
Doctor?

41:46.737 --> 41:49.035
Do you know who l am?

41:50.374 --> 41:52.774
Do you know where you are?

41:52.843 --> 41:56.745
l appear to be
on the holodeck grid.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.907
That's right.

41:58.983 --> 42:01.884
And do you know what you are?

42:01.986 --> 42:04.318
Yes. l'm...

42:04.388 --> 42:07.186
l'm the emergency
medical holographic program.

42:07.258 --> 42:09.556
Right?

42:09.627 --> 42:11.356
Right.

42:11.428 --> 42:15.728
Well, l assume
everything that's happened

42:15.799 --> 42:17.096
took place here on the holodeck?

42:17.167 --> 42:18.099
That's right.

42:18.168 --> 42:20.102
We encountered
a subspace anomaly

42:20.170 --> 42:23.037
and there was a radiation
surge in the computer system.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.940
And Kes is my assistant...

42:26.010 --> 42:27.773
not my wife?

42:27.845 --> 42:29.107
Your wife?

42:29.179 --> 42:31.511
Never mind.

42:31.582 --> 42:33.447
Captain, if it's okay,

42:33.517 --> 42:35.542
l'd like to return
to Sick Bay now.

42:35.619 --> 42:36.984
Of course.

42:37.054 --> 42:39.318
lt's good to have you back,
Doctor.

42:39.390 --> 42:41.824
lt's good to be back.

42:41.892 --> 42:45.089
Computer, transfer
EMH program to Sick Bay.

42:52.303 --> 42:53.861
We were married?

42:53.938 --> 42:57.430
lt was a delusion, of course.

42:57.508 --> 42:59.999
l understand...
but l'd still prefer it

43:00.044 --> 43:02.444
if you didn't tell
Neelix about this.

43:02.479 --> 43:05.380
He tends to get
a little jealous.

43:05.449 --> 43:07.178
lt'll be our secret.

43:09.153 --> 43:11.713
l am curious about one thing.

43:11.789 --> 43:12.881
What's that?

43:12.957 --> 43:14.083
The radiation surge

43:14.158 --> 43:16.126
caused my program to malfunction

43:16.193 --> 43:19.162
and my codes and circuits
began to degrade,

43:19.229 --> 43:23.393
and yet, instead of detecting
that threat to my program,

43:23.467 --> 43:25.833
l experienced
an elaborate delusion

43:25.903 --> 43:27.871
concerning the nature
of my existence--

43:27.938 --> 43:30.065
human or hologram.

43:30.140 --> 43:34.236
Person... or projection.

43:34.311 --> 43:35.801
Why?

43:35.879 --> 43:39.713
Why would my program focus
on such an esoteric dilemma?

43:39.783 --> 43:41.978
Well...

43:42.052 --> 43:45.954
l sometimes ask
those kind of questions.

43:46.056 --> 43:47.182
Who am l?

43:47.257 --> 43:49.817
What am l doing here?

43:49.893 --> 43:52.794
What's my purpose in life?

43:52.863 --> 43:54.592
Doesn't everybody?

43:54.665 --> 43:55.859
Not me.

43:55.933 --> 43:58.959
l know exactly who l am
and what my purpose is.

43:59.036 --> 44:00.731
l am
the Emergency Medical Hologram

44:00.838 --> 44:02.635
aboard the Starship Voyager.

44:04.875 --> 44:06.900
Are you sure about that?

44:45.149 --> 44:46.309
Hmm.
