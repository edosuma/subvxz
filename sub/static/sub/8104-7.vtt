WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:07.423
So now the plan is either
find ourselves a new counselor,

00:07.549 --> 00:08.966
stick it out with the old one
but go more often,

00:09.176 --> 00:12.804
or resign ourselves to the fact
that she's never gonna be happy

00:12.930 --> 00:14.806
no matter what I do, so let's
just take the money we're wasting

00:14.932 --> 00:17.225
and put it towards
a membership at Lakeview.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.852
I'm guessing the last option
has yet to be formally presented.

00:19.978 --> 00:20.937
Yeah.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.898
Jeez. What's with you? You usually
run half speed to stay with me.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.025
Didn't get a lot
of sleep last night.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.781
- How are things with Elyse?
- Great.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.117
- Great?
- Yeah.

00:36.328 --> 00:39.330
One-syllable answers. You're either out
of breath, or you're lying to me.

00:39.456 --> 00:43.000
Yeah. We have our moments,
but they usually work out.

00:43.127 --> 00:45.211
- Man, you got some water?
- Yeah.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.589
So how do you
work things out?

00:49.007 --> 00:51.676
I don't know.
We talk, someone apologizes.

00:51.969 --> 00:55.221
- I shouldn't have drank last night.
- Hey, you mean you apologize.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.100
- Yeah, I guess.
- How often do you guys have sex?

00:59.852 --> 01:01.894
- Enough.
- You do it this morning?

01:03.689 --> 01:05.314
You did.
You did it this morning.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.735
Maybe that's why
you can't stand up, huh? Come on.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.070
Elyse.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.036
Great.
Honey, I'm dehydrated.

01:19.538 --> 01:22.123
Do we have anything
with electrolytes?

01:24.042 --> 01:26.169
Sleeping Beauty, wake up.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.881
This is
an emergency.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.549
The fridge is empty.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.802
Come on.
It's almost 4:00.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.015
Elyse. Sweetie.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.854
Call Jacques. Tell him
I'm not feeling well.

01:45.564 --> 01:49.525
It's Saturday. You haven't been to work
in three days. Remember?

01:49.985 --> 01:51.569
Just let me sleep.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.031
Come on. You haven't been out of bed
since Wednesday.

01:55.157 --> 01:58.451
- Leave me alone.
- Come on. What's up?

01:58.577 --> 02:01.621
- No. Leave me alone.
- Honey.

02:01.747 --> 02:02.997
I said leave me alone!

02:13.133 --> 02:15.802
I think there's
something wrong with me.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.754
She's been averaging 18 hours of sleep
a day since her admission.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.049
Clinical depression.
Incredibly contagious.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.009
Every time I'm around one of them,
I get blue.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.636
It's not clinical depression.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.931
Great. Got it all figured out.
You don't need me.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.601
Three ER doctors, two neurologists

03:05.727 --> 03:07.353
and a radiologist have all figured out
what it's not.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.604
We need to
figure out what it is.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.065
If any of those doctors
were interested in my opinion,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.191
they would have asked for it.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.194
None of them are willing to subject
themselves to you.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.863
No pain, no gain.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.324
The blood work
shows no signs of inflammation,

03:20.450 --> 03:22.118
and no one can figure out
what's actually the cause...

03:23.203 --> 03:24.120
What?

03:24.246 --> 03:27.331
Husband described her
as being unusually irritable recently.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.666
And?

03:28.792 --> 03:32.003
I didn't realize it was possible
for a woman to be unusually irritable.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.260
Nice try, but you're a misanthrope,
not a misogynist.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.054
What's the first thing you ask a doctor
who's referring a patient?

03:42.180 --> 03:44.682
Are you questioning
my ability to take a history?

03:46.351 --> 03:47.351
What's the primary...

03:47.477 --> 03:50.229
- Not "what?" Why?
- Diseases don't have motives.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.231
No, but doctors do.

03:52.482 --> 03:55.234
Why this patient?
What interests you?

03:56.111 --> 03:58.279
- Give me the chart.
- Why?

04:00.032 --> 04:02.325
I find your
interest interesting.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.997
She's irritable and
sleeping 18 hours a day.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.582
What's interesting about that?

04:09.708 --> 04:13.044
Hypersomnia's usually accompanied
by irritability in depressed patients.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.755
True, but not relevant.
She's not depressed.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.257
Hello.
She's sleeping 18 hours a day.

04:18.383 --> 04:21.010
Fever. Clinical depression
does not cause fever.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.136
She could be
sick and depressed.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.429
She's sick.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.431
Damn it.
Why didn't I think of that?

04:25.557 --> 04:26.557
Yeah, that's
what I meant.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.351
Elevated sed rate
indicates inflammation.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.770
Hypersomnia and personality changes
point toward the brain.

04:30.896 --> 04:34.231
Not the spleen?
Thank goodness we hired a neurologist.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.901
Brain symptoms... Hmm.
Could this be a brain problem?

04:37.027 --> 04:39.570
No other systemic signs of inflammation.
Probably not vasculitis.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.906
What about parasites?
Malaria, Chagas.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.241
But the patient's never been
outside of the United States,

04:44.368 --> 04:45.368
especially the tropics.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.954
You mean she claims
she's never been outside the U.S.

04:48.080 --> 04:48.996
- Very good.
- Doesn't matter.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.290
Blood and CSF smears
show no sign of parasites.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.416
Has to be a tumor then.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.710
A tumor sitting directly
on top of the brain stem

04:54.836 --> 04:58.005
that three ER doctors, two neurologists
and a radiologist missed?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.007
Partridge in a pear tree
missed it too.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.968
Redo the blood work,
and get a new MRI

05:02.094 --> 05:05.262
with 2mm cuts
through the mesodiencephalic.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.973
And check for
evil stepmothers.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.892
This much sleep usually indicates
poison apples.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.187
Anything else besides
the shortness of breath?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.271
Not really.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.357
It's actually just
kind of a tightness.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.401
- You smoke?
- No, never.

05:18.527 --> 05:21.112
- Exercise?
- Eight hours a day.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.074
- I teach preschool.
- Sounds fun.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.161
Any history of heart disease
in your family?

05:29.287 --> 05:31.664
- Not that I know of.
- Take a deep breath.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.711
Been under
a lot of stress lately?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.504
No more than usual.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.715
You're probably
just a little anemic.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.134
I'm gonna do an EKG
just to make sure.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.093
Do I need to take this off?

05:44.219 --> 05:47.138
No. You can just
pull that down in front.

05:51.893 --> 05:53.269
Good Lord.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.566
- Are those real?
- Do they look real?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.609
They look pretty damn good.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.903
They were a present
for my husband's 40th.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.990
I figured he'd enjoy them
more than a sweater.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.950
That's so sweet.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.077
But I'm afraid
the cause of your problem

06:10.203 --> 06:12.038
could be staring us
right in the face.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.415
Actually, I guess
I'm the one doing the staring.

06:15.125 --> 06:17.835
Of course, I can't be sure.
I'd like to consult a colleague.

06:17.961 --> 06:21.130
He's actually somewhat
of an expert in these matters.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.634
Can I get a page
on Dr. Wilson?

06:28.180 --> 06:29.930
- A tumor?
- We don't know.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.557
We're checking
just to be safe.

06:31.683 --> 06:32.725
Y'all already
checked for that.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.643
The previous MRI
had a broader view.

06:34.770 --> 06:38.564
Some tumors are almost impossible to see
unless you know exactly where to look.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.024
That means it would be small,
right?

06:40.150 --> 06:41.150
Yeah.

06:41.276 --> 06:43.652
Then you'd be able to
operate, take it out?

06:43.779 --> 06:46.572
If it's a tumor, there are a variety
of treatment options,

06:46.698 --> 06:49.033
but there are variables
other than just size.

06:51.453 --> 06:55.456
- Don't worry.
- Too late.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.671
Try to remain
as still as possible.

07:02.798 --> 07:05.341
The less distortion there is,
the more detail we'll be able to see.

07:05.467 --> 07:06.592
Okay.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.939
x-ray tech,
report to Radiology Room 3.

07:21.483 --> 07:24.235
Well. That's what
breasts look like.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.196
Is a lie a lie
if everybody knows it's a lie?

07:27.322 --> 07:29.240
Well, if a tree
pretends to fall in a forest...

07:29.366 --> 07:30.825
House, come on.
They're breasts.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.202
They're a birthday present,
not a philosophical treatise.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.330
Lie number one.
She did not do that for her husband.

07:36.456 --> 07:37.456
She did that for herself.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.166
She thinks if she looks different,
she'll be different.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.794
No. She thinks if she looks different,
she'll be more attractive,

07:41.920 --> 07:45.005
- which I have to say...
- Not to her husband.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.175
Cosmetic surgery is so everyone else
will look at us differently.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.678
The same reason
you're wearing that tie.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.180
Well, exactly.
That was gonna be my next point.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.599
Last three months,
same five ties.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.643
Thursday should be
that paisley thing.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.062
- It's a gift from my wife.
- No, it's not.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.439
Julie hates green.
You bought that yourself.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.942
You want to look
pretty at work.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.112
Wilson's got a girlfriend.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.573
Stop. Stop. I don't.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.743
It takes two department heads
to treat shortness of breath?

08:15.287 --> 08:18.831
What, do the complications
increase exponentially with cup size?

08:19.166 --> 08:24.086
I want an EKG and blood tests,
including tox screen on Mrs...

08:24.212 --> 08:25.129
Exam Room 1.

08:25.255 --> 08:28.215
You're ordering tests
to cover your lechery.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.551
- Interesting.
- Very tricky case.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.556
You love everybody.
That's your pathology.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.645
There were no lesions
and no mass effect that we could see.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.356
What does that mean?

08:44.900 --> 08:48.152
It means we're still not sure what's
causing the neurological problems.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.905
I know some things
are hard to cure,

08:51.364 --> 08:53.741
but what I just don't get
is why it's taking so long

08:53.867 --> 08:55.201
to figure out
what's wrong with her.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.952
I know you're scared.
I would be too.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.955
- I don't feel good.
- You feeling nauseous?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.209
Honey, are you all right?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.671
She's seizing!

09:09.257 --> 09:10.507
Get her on her side.

09:10.634 --> 09:11.634
I need some Ativan!

09:11.760 --> 09:12.593
I'll get it.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.305
- What's happened?
- She's having a seizure.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.225
She's aspirating. Suction.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.067
Come on, Elyse.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.088
The MRI
reveals nothing.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.506
That we were
able to detect.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.799
It's not a tumor.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.051
A small glioma could
hide from contrast.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.177
We could do a PET scan.

09:55.303 --> 09:59.139
Yes. That's how a responsible doctor
would waste his time in this situation.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.268
Suddenly tests and radiologists
are incapable of error?

10:02.394 --> 10:04.853
A glioma not presenting
on a contrast MRI

10:04.980 --> 10:07.231
would have to be smaller
than a grain of sand,

10:07.357 --> 10:09.650
which does not
a gravely ill person make.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.069
It could be just
postictal disorientation.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.487
We would have seen
improvement by now.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.698
Late-stage Lyme disease
can cause seizures.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.450
- Does the husband care about her?
- He hasn't left her bedside.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.868
How annoying.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.996
It also means she doesn't
have Lyme disease.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.664
What, love conquers all?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.874
Lyme disease initially
presents with a rash.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.001
Mr. Clingy would have noticed.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.212
- We've looked at everything else.
- Did you look at her breasts?

10:30.547 --> 10:31.964
Men.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.800
It could be paraneoplastic.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.678
She have any family history
of breast cancer?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.638
Her mother died of it.

10:40.432 --> 10:44.518
The brain, but not the brain.
Clever, huh?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.361
How can breast cancer
cause problems in her brain?

10:55.030 --> 10:56.613
There are
molecular similarities

10:56.740 --> 10:58.574
between brain cells
and tumor cells.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.243
Paraneoplastic syndrome
causes the body's own antibodies

11:01.369 --> 11:03.120
to get thrown off track.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.998
They end up attacking the brain
instead of the tumor.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.792
So, if you do find a tumor,
what do you do?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.837
We treat the
underlying malignancy.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.005
Once there's no
tumor to attack,

11:13.131 --> 11:15.424
there's nothing for the antibodies
to get confused about.

11:15.550 --> 11:18.260
- If the tumor's treatable.
- Exactly.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.475
Ow!

11:24.601 --> 11:26.685
I'm sorry.
I know it's uncomfortable.

11:26.811 --> 11:30.064
The tighter we go,
the better the image will be.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.528
- At least it'll keep me awake.
- Don't worry. It's almost over.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.449
I wish people would stop
telling me not to worry.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.993
I'm sorry.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.623
My mom was
the same age.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.135
We've been trying to get pregnant
for over a year.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.304
Guess we're lucky
we didn't.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.890
A lot has changed
since your mom died.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.683
Don't worry...

12:08.853 --> 12:09.978
Don't give up.

12:20.949 --> 12:22.491
No tumor?

12:22.617 --> 12:25.869
The MRI and the mammogram only
showed a few benign calcifications.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.122
It's most likely
a small-cell tumor.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.332
It's no surprise
we're having trouble finding it.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.835
We should do a PET scan.
Start with her lungs,

12:32.961 --> 12:34.169
then maybe her bones.

12:34.295 --> 12:35.963
Sometimes it presents
with no tumor at all.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.924
How can a disease caused by a tumor
present if there's no tumor?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.926
It happens.
12% of cases.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.095
And how do you treat it
if there's no tumor?

12:43.221 --> 12:46.265
You don't.
Those 12%, no treatment.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.143
They were too busy
looking for the tumor

12:49.269 --> 12:51.145
right till they put
the patient in the ground.

12:51.646 --> 12:52.771
What choice do we have?

12:52.897 --> 12:55.899
Treat the symptoms.
IV immunoglobulin.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.068
So we're just
gonna ignore the tumor?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.070
Well, eventually
it'll get bigger.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.989
Then it'll be
really easy to find.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.158
One of you needs to
check out where she works.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.410
- Why?
- 'Cause the husband's not sick.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.661
Meaning?

13:07.787 --> 13:11.707
If it's not paraneoplastic, and it is
a reaction to some sort of toxin,

13:11.833 --> 13:14.668
it's obviously not
coming from their home.

13:15.378 --> 13:17.045
Foreman, you do it.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.926
Why are you riding me?

13:23.052 --> 13:25.846
It's what I do.
Has it got worse lately?

13:25.972 --> 13:28.599
- Yeah. Seems to me.
- Really?

13:29.100 --> 13:30.934
Well, that rules out
the race thing.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.021
'Cause you were just
as black last week.

13:35.190 --> 13:36.398
How long has
Elyse worked here?

13:36.524 --> 13:38.734
Oh, three years.
She's my best rotisseur.

13:38.860 --> 13:39.818
And what's that?

13:39.944 --> 13:43.197
The rotisseur prepares
the roasted meats and gravies.

13:43.615 --> 13:44.907
How do you
clean your grill?

13:46.493 --> 13:49.161
- You say "elbow grease".
- Do you use chemical cleaners?

13:49.287 --> 13:50.204
Non. Absolument.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.122
The chefs don't do
the cleaning anyway.

13:52.248 --> 13:55.709
What about pesticides? You must spray
for roaches and that sort of thing.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.712
No. My kitchen is clean.
No roaches.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.426
I need to get
back to work.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.179
So the fact that I'm here
asking you these questions,

14:07.305 --> 14:09.139
it doesn't worry you?

14:09.265 --> 14:11.058
Look at me.
I'm here 18 hours a day.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.935
That guy
practically lives here.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.520
He does live here.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.438
I use the same detergents
for 15 years,

14:16.564 --> 14:18.273
and everyone is
healthy as a horse.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.109
Whatever Elyse has,
she didn't get here.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.612
Tell her I hope
she feels better.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.989
And I had to get
a new rotisseur.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.753
Where's Ed?

14:40.171 --> 14:42.589
He went down to the gift shop
to buy a shirt.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.716
I told him I'd stay up here
just in case you woke up.

14:46.261 --> 14:48.762
You must have
better things to do.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.056
I send my laundry out.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.059
- You're not married?
- No.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.770
Waiting for the perfect guy?

14:57.605 --> 15:00.524
Let me guess.
You've already found him.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.114
He threw my towels
out the window.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.784
That's how we met.

15:11.202 --> 15:16.248
Freshman year, Ed came to a party
that my roommate and I threw.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.210
He spent most of the night
on the bathroom floor.

15:21.671 --> 15:25.173
He figured I wouldn't notice
the vomit on the towels

15:25.300 --> 15:27.134
if I didn't have
any towels.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.180
I'm assuming he came back
the next day to apologize?

15:32.307 --> 15:34.891
No way.
I had to track him down.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.648
Conflict resolution has never been
one of Ed's strong points.

15:43.067 --> 15:47.237
- Nobody's perfect, right?
- I guess.

15:48.114 --> 15:49.573
Oh, my neck hurts.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.244
You've been in this bed
for a really long time.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.499
We're gonna do the same test
we did last night, okay?

15:59.626 --> 16:03.045
- Do you know what day it is?
- My arm itches.

16:03.171 --> 16:04.630
It's probably
a mild skin irritation.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.090
I'll get you some
hydrocortisone in a minute.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.052
- Do you know what day it is?
- Tuesday. It really itches.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.222
How about I get you
that cream right now?

16:22.607 --> 16:24.983
Oh, my God! Get them off!
Get 'em off of me!

16:25.109 --> 16:26.193
Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off me!

16:26.319 --> 16:28.904
- Elyse, calm down.
- Get them off me!

16:29.030 --> 16:30.864
Elyse, calm down.
Calm down.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.991
They're biting me!
They're biting me!

16:33.117 --> 16:34.993
I'm gonna need some Haldol,
five milligrams.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.119
Honey, what's wrong?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.454
Get 'em off!

16:40.416 --> 16:41.541
Get 'em off.
Get 'em off.

16:41.668 --> 16:45.754
There's nothing there, Elyse.
There's nothing there.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
Ow!

16:50.218 --> 16:51.802
We had to sedate her.

16:51.928 --> 16:55.222
You gave sedatives to a patient
who's already sleeping 18 hours a day?

16:55.348 --> 16:57.849
It was better than letting her
scratch all the skin off her arms.

16:57.975 --> 16:58.934
Where's Wilson?

16:59.060 --> 17:01.728
Creepy-crawlies are consistent
with paraneoplastic syndrome.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.064
Onset immediately
after IV IG isn't.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.024
There is
a simple explanation.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.527
Maybe she really has
bugs under her skin.

17:08.653 --> 17:09.486
Infection?

17:10.279 --> 17:13.615
That's whata worsening of symptoms
after immunotherapy would suggest.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.243
Blood cultures and the timeline
rule out most bacteria.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.079
Patient throws up on your shoes,
do you clean up most of it?

17:19.205 --> 17:22.749
The symptoms rule out the rest.
Serology rules out viruses.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.918
CSF smears rule out parasites.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.213
In the final stage
of African trypanosomiasis,

17:28.339 --> 17:30.590
almost all the parasites
are inside the brain.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.801
It's possible they
wouldn't show on smears.

17:32.927 --> 17:36.138
But it's not possible for a patient
who's never been to Africa

17:36.264 --> 17:37.723
to have African
sleeping sickness.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.224
I'm just saying it
fits the symptoms.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.726
She could've got it
from a transfusion.

17:40.852 --> 17:43.019
Or I'm just saying she could've got it
from a transfusion.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.230
Which she never had.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.482
- Okay.
- What about toxins?

17:47.608 --> 17:50.652
No, the kitchen she works in
is cleaner than some hospitals.

17:50.778 --> 17:55.407
But they do serve rabbit.
Rabbit fever fits her symptoms.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.785
Tularemia initially presents with a rash
or ulcer near the infection site.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.620
Not if she inhaled it.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.124
Chopping the meat with the cleaver
could easily aerosolize the bacteria.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.168
No. Then she'd have
respiratory symptoms.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.211
Maybe she ignored it,
figured she had a cold.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.254
We rejected Lyme disease

18:09.380 --> 18:11.006
because the couple would
have noticed a rash,

18:11.132 --> 18:14.009
but a wet, hacking cough
is just gonna slip right by?

18:14.135 --> 18:17.012
It's either that or
she missed her exit on the turnpike

18:17.138 --> 18:18.805
and wound up in Africa.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.849
Okay, two lousy ideas.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.477
Unfortunately, they're better
than all the other ideas.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.730
Tularemia. Bizarre.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.902
Very nice.
That's why I ride you.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.413
Did he just turn on the TV?

18:43.873 --> 18:45.457
He needs to think.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.211
So this should tell us
whether or not she's got rabbit fever?

18:49.337 --> 18:50.670
For a diagnosis
of tularemia

18:50.797 --> 18:53.632
you need a fourfold increase
in serum antibody levels.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.884
To measure an increase you need
a before. All we have is an after.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.345
A single titer over 160
would be a big clue.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.888
"That's why I ride you."
What does that mean?

19:00.014 --> 19:01.723
Even when I have a good idea,
it's because of him?

19:01.933 --> 19:04.434
Actually, I think he said
your idea was a lousy idea.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.019
It has to be
one of these two conditions.

19:06.229 --> 19:08.939
I say we take our best guess
and just start treatment. Or treat both.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.566
The treatment for tularemia
can cause aplastic anemia.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.901
How come he
doesn't ride you guys?

19:13.027 --> 19:15.612
- Got a crush on you.
- He just doesn't know how to show it.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.072
Get over it.
He rides everybody.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.950
And the treatment for sleeping sickness
kills one in 10 patients.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.576
So we start with
the safer treatment.

19:21.911 --> 19:26.248
By "safer", you mean the one that's
slightly less likely to kill her.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.847
Foreman got the gang
testing for tularemia?

19:41.973 --> 19:45.058
Yep. Probably inconclusive,
but worth doing.

19:45.977 --> 19:48.603
So, what's her name?
When do I get to meet her?

19:48.729 --> 19:49.896
There's nobody.
Give it up.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.190
Your lips say no.
Your shoes say yes.

19:52.316 --> 19:55.235
Well, they're French.
You can't trust a word they say.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.445
Solid, yet stylish.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.156
A professional woman
would be impressed.

20:00.283 --> 20:03.159
I'm thinking accountant.
Actuary, maybe.

20:03.578 --> 20:07.205
It's somebody in the hospital.
Patient?

20:07.331 --> 20:10.333
No. Chemo's not sexy.
Daughter of a patient?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.919
She would certainly have
the neediness you need.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.838
I'm not gonna date
a patient's daughter.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.339
Very ethical.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.050
Of course, most married men would say
they don't date at all.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.719
There was no date.

20:21.804 --> 20:24.222
I had lunch with
one of the nurses.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.849
It's her first time
in an oncology unit.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.934
She's having
a tough time emotionally.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.020
- Perfect.
- I wanted to be nice.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.480
That's all. I mean it.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.400
You always do.
It's part of your charm.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.321
Hi, boys.
Mrs. Campbell's test results.

20:39.447 --> 20:42.616
You remember her. The preschool teacher
with the heart of silicone.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.702
- No. Doesn't ring a bell.
- They came in yesterday.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.412
I figured you guys
would have been all over them.

20:47.538 --> 20:50.165
- I know how concerned you were.
- She's all upset

20:50.291 --> 20:52.208
'cause we paid more attention
to the other girl.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.794
You check out her ass.
I've got the chest.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.214
The tests were normal.
Of course, that's just my opinion.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.008
You might wanna call
a couple of guys from maintenance

21:00.134 --> 21:01.509
in for a consult.

21:01.636 --> 21:04.304
You check her EKG results
before she left the other day?

21:04.430 --> 21:06.348
- You ordered it.
- You're the responsible one.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.016
What's wrong?
They look normal to me.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.894
- Where is she?
- Waiting downstairs. Why?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.771
I was right.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.739
Do I have
to get rid of the implants?

21:23.032 --> 21:24.866
Surprisingly, no.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.036
But your EKG shows
a slightly decreased heart rate.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.162
Is that a problem?

21:29.288 --> 21:31.414
You told me you hadn't changed
your diet or exercise.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.125
- Were you lying?
- Lying?

21:34.251 --> 21:36.336
Does your husband have
high blood pressure?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.129
- My husband?
- Yeah, you see,

21:38.255 --> 21:40.048
if you're gonna
repeat everything I say,

21:40.174 --> 21:43.009
this conversation's
gonna take twice as long.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.552
Yes. He was diagnosed
six months ago.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.096
He do a lot of
cooking at home?

21:46.222 --> 21:48.056
Not really, other than
oatmeal in the morning.

21:48.182 --> 21:52.185
Did you happen to notice a slightly
odd taste to the oatmeal lately?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.186
Wait. Are you saying that...

21:53.312 --> 21:54.854
That it looks like
your husband stirred in

21:54.981 --> 21:56.231
some of his blood
pressure medication

21:56.357 --> 21:57.524
along with the brown sugar.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.401
You think my husband's
trying to poison me?

21:59.527 --> 22:01.569
No. Nothing like that.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.532
He just doesn't want
to have sex with you.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.951
Decreased sex drive is one of the most
common side effects

22:08.077 --> 22:09.536
of the beta-blockers
he's been taking.

22:09.662 --> 22:13.331
I'm guessing he figured if you're
both frigid, no harm, no foul.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.000
Should've gotten
him the sweater.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.836
- That's ridiculous.
- Fine.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.629
But if you're still concerned
about the shortness of breath,

22:19.755 --> 22:22.048
I'd start making
your own breakfast.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.383
Wait.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.845
What should I do?

22:28.514 --> 22:32.726
If you care about your husband at all,
I'd do the responsible thing.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.937
Buy yourself some condoms,
go to a bar, find...

22:41.652 --> 22:42.944
Huh.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.874
Lab tests inconclusive?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.709
Not surprisingly.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.169
No. But too bad.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.256
- Luckily, I have the answer.
- To what?

23:03.674 --> 23:06.634
Thanks for asking.
To life itself. Sex.

23:06.761 --> 23:08.136
Anything that can be transmitted
via the blood

23:08.262 --> 23:09.679
can be transmitted
through sex.

23:09.805 --> 23:12.474
- Sleeping sickness from sex?
- It's not without precedent.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.725
I'm pretty sure it is,

23:13.851 --> 23:15.268
unless you're talking
about going to Africa

23:15.394 --> 23:17.020
and having sex
with a tsetse fly.

23:17.146 --> 23:19.981
A Portuguese man was diagnosed
three years ago

23:20.107 --> 23:21.441
with CNS-affected
sleeping sickness.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.151
His only connection with Africa

23:23.277 --> 23:26.112
was through a girlfriend who'd served
with the military in Angola.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.322
Boy. Where'd you find that?

23:27.448 --> 23:31.076
The Journal of the Instituto
de Higiene e Medicina Tropical.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.411
- You don't read Portuguese?
- You do?

23:33.537 --> 23:34.954
Pretty sure
that's what it said.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.165
Either that or it was
an ad for sunglasses.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.459
Her husband has never
been to Africa either.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.837
Stymied again.
Your logic is bulletproof.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.049
I think ignoring respiratory symptoms
is more likely than cheating.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.342
Because?

23:47.468 --> 23:49.511
They're completely
devoted to each other.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.348
- Because?
- They love each other.

23:53.808 --> 23:54.682
Or?

23:55.684 --> 23:58.103
They're overcompensating
for guilt.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.688
Find out which it is.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.357
You want me to
ask a man whose wife

24:02.483 --> 24:04.275
is about to die
if he cheated on her?

24:04.401 --> 24:07.320
No, I want you to be
polite and let her die.

24:07.696 --> 24:09.030
Actually, I don't want you
to ask her anything.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.616
Foreman, take the husband.
Chase, take the wife.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.129
You don't trust me
to do my job?

24:24.505 --> 24:27.257
We all formulate questions based
on the answers we want to hear.

24:27.383 --> 24:30.510
And how exactly do you reformulate,
"Have you screwed around?"

24:30.636 --> 24:31.845
Did you know she's been
trying to get pregnant?

24:31.971 --> 24:33.513
- Yes.
- After you got so freaked

24:33.639 --> 24:36.349
about the sick babies a while ago,
I figured that was your thing.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.143
But you've never been
prescribed folic acid,

24:38.269 --> 24:40.103
and you can't lose a baby
if you've never been pregnant.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.189
- You pulled my medical records?
- You coughed the other day.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.524
I was concerned.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.901
You were curious,
like an eight-year-old boy

24:47.027 --> 24:51.322
with a puzzle that's just a little
too grown-up for him to figure out.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.074
"Tomayto, tomahto."

24:54.910 --> 24:58.913
So it's either sleeping sickness
or this rabbit thing?

24:59.206 --> 25:01.249
They're both fatal
without treatment.

25:01.375 --> 25:04.586
And unfortunately, the treatment
for both is extremely dangerous.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.672
- Are there tests you can do?
- Not at this stage.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.884
But each condition
has a unique history.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.263
We're hoping your answers
to a few questions will help us.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.765
Sure.
Whatever you need to know.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.477
Before the sleeping problems,
did you have any trouble breathing?

25:21.604 --> 25:24.856
A cough that wouldn't go away,
anything like that?

25:26.942 --> 25:27.984
No.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.736
Are you certain?

25:29.862 --> 25:30.820
Absolutely.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.822
I've never been away from her
for more than a night.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.117
If she had breathing troubles
I would've noticed.

25:37.620 --> 25:41.122
The other condition is
significantly more likely

25:43.417 --> 25:45.460
if you've had an affair.

25:45.586 --> 25:50.006
- Have you ever had an affair?
- Of course not.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.674
Are you sure?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.968
I think I'd remember
cheating on my wife.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.261
You might be
reluctant to admit it.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.387
No.

25:56.513 --> 25:58.306
I just want to be
perfectly clear.

25:58.515 --> 26:02.352
If your wife has sleeping sickness,
and we don't treat her,

26:03.395 --> 26:04.437
she'll die.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.522
I would never
do that to Ed.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.026
I love him.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.653
Absolutely not.

26:12.613 --> 26:14.113
I love her.

26:27.836 --> 26:30.255
All right then.
They say no cheating,

26:30.381 --> 26:32.215
we cross off
sleeping sickness.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.050
Any new ideas?

26:36.220 --> 26:38.012
Okay. We go with
Foreman's tularemia.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.597
Start her on IV
chloramphenicol,

26:39.723 --> 26:42.100
25 milligrams per kilogram,
four times a day.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.768
Good night.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.366
Where's Ed?

26:58.492 --> 26:59.701
Right next to you.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.037
Well, you're two down,
two to go.

27:04.873 --> 27:08.793
- Two days?
- No. Doses.

27:08.919 --> 27:11.129
You have about 20 more days
of this fun.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.339
What time is it?

27:13.799 --> 27:16.884
About 4:00 a.m.
I pulled the short straw.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.682
Flow rate looks good.

27:27.521 --> 27:29.230
No rash or flushing.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.858
What time is it?

27:34.611 --> 27:35.945
4:00 a.m.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.365
Do you not remember
just asking?

27:41.660 --> 27:42.994
I...

27:44.079 --> 27:45.288
Elyse?

27:48.042 --> 27:50.293
Elyse? Elyse?

27:50.919 --> 27:51.753
Elyse.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.839
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to wake her.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.883
- She fall asleep again?
- In the middle of a sentence.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.634
Elyse. Elyse.

27:58.761 --> 27:59.886
What's happening?

28:00.012 --> 28:01.679
Patient's not responding.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.098
Pulse is fine.
Airway's open.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.142
Check her blood pressure.

28:08.479 --> 28:10.063
Pupils are reactive.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.440
Elyse, wake up.
You gotta wake up.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.942
What does that mean?
What are you doing?

28:15.069 --> 28:19.155
She's unresponsive to pain.
Come on, Elyse.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.825
- Is she dying?
- I don't know.

28:33.420 --> 28:34.962
She's in a coma.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.182
There's only one way
a tularemia patient goes into a coma

28:46.308 --> 28:48.017
while on
IV chloramphenicol.

28:48.143 --> 28:49.727
The patient
doesn't have tularemia.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.354
And then there was one.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.398
Patient comes in
'cause she's sleeping too much.

28:53.524 --> 28:56.484
It takes 10 doctors and a coma
to diagnose sleeping sickness.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.777
And then there was none.

28:57.986 --> 29:01.030
We still have the problem of explaining
how a white chick from Jersey

29:01.156 --> 29:04.200
who's never traveled south of DC
has African sleeping sickness.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.702
The obvious explanation.

29:06.829 --> 29:08.121
I made it clear.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.705
If this guy's lying
about sleeping around,

29:09.832 --> 29:12.166
he knows he's
murdering his wife.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.168
Does seem unlikely.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.295
Go away.

29:34.314 --> 29:36.232
What are you doing?

29:37.067 --> 29:41.904
Checking for lymphadenopathy.
And waiting for you.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.366
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. House.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.536
Your wife has
human African trypanosomiasis.

29:50.372 --> 29:51.414
Sleeping sickness.

29:51.540 --> 29:56.461
You mean it's not tularemia,
a virus, tumor or cancer?

29:56.587 --> 29:57.587
No.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.467
I've never had an affair.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.138
- I believe you.
- And I trust Elyse.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.560
The treatment for
this disease is a drug

30:12.978 --> 30:15.897
that's fatal on its own
10% of the time.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.191
Which is why I need
your written consent

30:18.317 --> 30:19.942
before I can
legally prescribe it.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.361
Why would she lie
if she knew it could kill her?

30:22.488 --> 30:25.865
I don't ask why patients lie.
I just assume they all do.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.409
- But why?
- To protect you,

30:28.535 --> 30:32.163
because she didn't think it mattered,
it just seemed easier,

30:33.415 --> 30:35.208
because that's what people do.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.962
If you're absolutely
certain that your wife

30:40.088 --> 30:41.797
has never had sex
with anyone but you

30:41.924 --> 30:44.217
since you were married,
then I'm wrong.

30:46.261 --> 30:50.181
But if you think there's a possibility
that just one time

30:51.892 --> 30:53.559
she wasn't perfect,

30:54.520 --> 30:56.896
one weekend
you're out of town,

30:58.023 --> 30:59.857
one fight where
she ran to a friend,

30:59.983 --> 31:02.109
one stupid Christmas party,

31:04.947 --> 31:07.865
then you need to allow me
to start treatment.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.160
Because if we don't,

31:11.662 --> 31:13.538
she's gonna be dead
by tomorrow morning.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.132
You trust your
wife that much?

31:27.928 --> 31:29.303
I don't know.

31:34.059 --> 31:36.102
I'm gonna start the treatment.

31:51.076 --> 31:54.120
- Glass syringes?
- And special IV tubing.

31:55.247 --> 31:58.207
- Why do we need this stuff?
- Because melarsoprol melts plastic.

31:58.333 --> 32:02.044
This stuff's basically arsenic
mixed with antifreeze.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.921
What doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, huh?

32:04.047 --> 32:06.966
Nietzsche wouldn't have been so glib
if he'd been prescribed melarsoprol.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.887
"Can cause vomiting,
abdominal pain,

32:12.014 --> 32:14.890
blood toxicity, neural damage,
cardiac arrhythmia."

32:15.017 --> 32:17.310
They forgot to say
it's gonna hurt like all hell.

32:17.686 --> 32:19.437
She's lucky
she's in a coma.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.789
How long before we
know if it's working?

32:38.915 --> 32:40.333
It's tough to say.

32:40.917 --> 32:44.128
It's a good sign
that she hasn't gotten any worse.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.257
Does she even know I'm here?

32:49.384 --> 32:51.927
She knows you're
always there for her.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.056
Yeah.

32:56.058 --> 32:57.725
If she gets better,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.436
it means she wasn't
always there for me.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.192
It means
she made a mistake.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.779
I can't help it.

33:10.322 --> 33:14.325
Part of me, a big part of me,
can't handle that.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.038
It doesn't want
her to get better.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.926
Does that make me
a terrible person?

33:39.726 --> 33:41.143
Yes.

34:02.999 --> 34:06.043
So you're treating her
for African sleeping sickness

34:06.169 --> 34:07.294
because you don't
think it's possible

34:07.421 --> 34:09.171
for someone to be
faithful in a relationship?

34:09.297 --> 34:11.340
- And you do?
- Yes.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.758
And you need to
tell me that.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.594
Look. I am not having an affair.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.847
I had lunch with
someone I work with.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.307
- At work. Once.
- I believe you.

34:20.434 --> 34:23.060
What I don't believe
is it'll be just once.

34:23.186 --> 34:25.271
- I love my wife.
- You certainly love saying it.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.066
I'm sorry. I know
you love your wife.

34:29.192 --> 34:32.278
You loved all your wives.
Probably still do.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.487
In fact,
you probably love all

34:33.613 --> 34:35.156
the women you loved
who weren't your wife.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.824
You can be a real jerk sometimes,
you know that?

34:36.950 --> 34:38.242
Yeah. And you're
the good guy.

34:38.368 --> 34:39.285
At least I try.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.495
As long as you're trying to be good,
you can do whatever you want.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.038
And as long as
you're not trying,

34:43.165 --> 34:44.415
you can say
whatever you want.

34:44.541 --> 34:46.167
So, between us,
we can do anything.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.960
We can rule the world.

35:01.266 --> 35:05.644
Mixing up some margaritas?
Mine's a double, senorita.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.980
- That's Portuguese, you know.
- Spanish.

35:09.649 --> 35:10.858
Uh-oh.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.989
- What's goin' on?
- I'm recalibrating the centrifuge.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.074
Turn around.

35:28.376 --> 35:32.838
It's a very sad thing,
an uncalibrated centrifuge.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.383
- Makes me cry too.
- I'm not crying.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.677
Okay.

35:52.859 --> 35:55.110
I told the husband
he was a jerk.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.155
Why?

36:05.413 --> 36:07.248
When I was in college,

36:10.669 --> 36:14.046
I fell in love,
and I got married.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.844
At that age,
the chances of a marriage lasting...

36:19.970 --> 36:21.679
It lasted six months.

36:24.224 --> 36:27.226
Thyroid cancer metastasized
to his brain.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.728
There was nothing
they could do.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.107
I was 21, and...

36:35.110 --> 36:36.944
I watched
my husband die.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.616
I'm sorry.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.747
But that's not
the whole story.

36:50.917 --> 36:53.460
It's a symptom,
not your illness.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.005
Thyroid cancer
would have been diagnosed

36:56.131 --> 36:57.339
at least
a year before his death.

36:57.465 --> 37:00.092
You knew he was dying
when you married him.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.637
Possibly when
you first met him.

37:06.266 --> 37:08.392
And you married
him anyway.

37:11.021 --> 37:14.940
You can't be that good a person
and well-adjusted.

37:16.026 --> 37:17.109
Why?

37:19.070 --> 37:21.864
'Cause you wind up
crying over centrifuges.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.660
Or hating people?

37:42.385 --> 37:44.345
Her fever
spiked at 104.

37:44.471 --> 37:45.971
Echo shows
global hyperkinesis.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.140
- Blood pressure?
- Barely 90 over 40.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.391
Did you give her dopamine?

37:49.517 --> 37:52.478
Started 270 micrograms per minute
10 minutes ago.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.063
Still no change.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.488
Killing the parasites
isn't gonna do much good

38:02.614 --> 38:04.323
if we kill her heart
at the same time.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.909
A heart can be replaced.
A brain can't.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.994
Right now
we're killing both.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.497
If she's gonna die,
we should at least let her do it

38:11.623 --> 38:14.249
without that acid
flowing through her veins.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.126
What's happening?

38:18.046 --> 38:20.172
We would've expected
your wife's condition

38:20.298 --> 38:22.508
to show some
improvement by now.

38:23.051 --> 38:24.218
It hasn't.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.720
It's going the other way.

38:57.794 --> 39:03.298
Please don't die.

39:29.451 --> 39:30.659
She's awake.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.660
Hey. She's gonna be okay.

40:14.788 --> 40:16.663
Yeah. Sure.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.070
What are you gonna do?

40:48.196 --> 40:50.823
Were you always
honest with her?

40:51.157 --> 40:53.033
Do you know how lucky you are?
Your wife is alive.

40:53.159 --> 40:54.618
She loves you.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.954
What she did...

40:58.039 --> 41:00.916
You can't love a person
and do that to them.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.837
She loves you.

41:42.542 --> 41:45.419
I need to know
who you had the affair with.

41:48.882 --> 41:52.176
He has to be notified
so he can get treatment as well.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.681
Why did you lie to us?

41:58.308 --> 42:00.726
You knew your
life was at stake.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.359
He's not coming back, is he?

42:14.532 --> 42:18.744
We all make mistakes,
and we all pay a price.

42:28.379 --> 42:29.922
I need that name.

42:43.645 --> 42:46.146
Hey, there.
How you doin'?

42:46.731 --> 42:47.814
Fine.

42:50.193 --> 42:52.486
Do you know
where your dad is?

43:00.912 --> 43:02.663
Can I help you?
