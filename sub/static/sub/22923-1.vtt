[Crowd screaming]

03:18.640 --> 03:22.180
Hey, pardon me for askin',
but who's that little old man?

03:22.180 --> 03:25.020
- What little old man?
- That little old man.

03:25.020 --> 03:26.890
Oh, that one.
That's my grandfather.

03:26.890 --> 03:29.060
- Your grandfather?
- Yeah.

03:29.060 --> 03:32.650
- That's not your grandfather.
- It is, you know.

03:32.650 --> 03:35.400
But I've seen your grandfather.
He lives in your house.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.700
Oh, that's my other grandfather,
but he's my grandfather as well.

03:38.700 --> 03:40.240
How do you reckon that one out?

03:40.240 --> 03:42.080
Well, everyone's entitled
to two, aren't they?

03:42.080 --> 03:43.240
And this is my other one.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.160
We know that,
but what's he doin' here?

03:46.160 --> 03:48.370
Well, my mother thought
the trip would do him good.

03:48.370 --> 03:51.460
- How's that?
- He's nursin' a broken heart.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.670
<i>JOHN:
Ah, poor old thing.</i>

03:53.670 --> 03:56.130
Hey, mister,
are you nursin' a broken heart?

03:57.720 --> 04:01.760
He's a nice old man, isn't he?

04:01.760 --> 04:03.810
He's very clean.

04:10.730 --> 04:13.610
- Hello, grandfather.
- Hello.

04:13.610 --> 04:15.030
He can talk then, can he?

04:15.030 --> 04:17.190
Of course he can talk.
He's a human being, isn't he?

04:17.190 --> 04:19.700
Well, if he's your grandfather,
who knows? Ha ha ha.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.080
And we're lookin' after him,
are we?

04:23.080 --> 04:26.120
- I look after meself.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.410
He's got you worried, then?

04:27.410 --> 04:30.370
Him, he's a villain,
a real mixer...

04:30.370 --> 04:32.630
and he costs you a fortune
in breach of promise cases.

04:32.630 --> 04:34.420
- GEORGE: Get on.
- No, straight up.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.670
Hiya.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.880
- Hello, Shake.
- Hello, Shake.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.220
- You got on all right, then?
- No.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.600
Oh? Well, we're here.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.260
<i>SHAKE: Norm'll be along
in a minute with the tickets.</i>

04:46.260 --> 04:48.310
Hey, who's the little old man?

04:48.310 --> 04:50.890
It's Paul's grandfather.

04:52.150 --> 04:54.940
- Oh, aye, but I thought...
- No, that's his other one.

04:54.940 --> 04:56.940
Oh, that's all right, then.

04:56.940 --> 04:59.740
Clean, though, isn't he?

04:59.740 --> 05:01.570
Oh, aye. He's very clean.

05:01.570 --> 05:04.700
- NORM: Mornin', lads.
- Hi, Norm.

05:04.700 --> 05:08.120
Thank God you've all got here.
Look, I've had a marvelous idea.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.960
Just for once,
let's all try to behave...

05:09.960 --> 05:11.960
like ordinary
respectable citizens.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.290
<i>Let's not cause any trouble,
pull any strokes...</i>

05:14.290 --> 05:16.210
or do anything
I'm gonna be sorry for...

05:16.210 --> 05:18.840
especially tomorrow in that
television theater, because...

05:18.840 --> 05:22.590
Are you listening to me,
Lennon?

05:22.590 --> 05:24.590
You're a swine.
Isn't he, George?

05:24.590 --> 05:26.140
Yeah, a swine.

05:26.140 --> 05:29.020
Thanks. Hey!

05:29.020 --> 05:31.230
ALL:
Who's that little old man?

05:31.230 --> 05:34.650
- Well, who is he?
- He belongs to Paul.

05:34.650 --> 05:36.900
Oh, well. I'm going down
for a cup of coffee.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.690
- Anyone coming?
- We'll follow you down.

05:38.690 --> 05:40.150
I want me coffee.

05:40.150 --> 05:42.070
You can come with Shake and me,
if you like.

05:42.070 --> 05:44.660
<i>PAUL: Look after him. I don't
want to find you've lost him.</i>

05:44.660 --> 05:49.330
Don't be cheeky. I'll bind him
to me with promises.

05:49.330 --> 05:53.420
Very clean, isn't he?
Come out, granddad.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.840
Make up your mind, will you?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.360
Hello. Morning.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.200
All right?

06:41.380 --> 06:42.630
Whoa.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.380
Do you mind if we have it open?

06:44.380 --> 06:45.880
Yes, I do.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.800
Well, there are four of us,
and we'd like it open...

06:47.800 --> 06:51.560
not if it's
all the same to you, that is.

06:51.560 --> 06:54.690
It isn't. I travel
on this train regularly...

06:54.690 --> 06:57.020
twice a week, so I suppose
I have some rights.

06:57.020 --> 06:58.400
So have we.

07:03.650 --> 07:06.410
[Playing rock and roll]

07:06.410 --> 07:08.990
And we'll have that thing
off as well. Thank you.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.490
- [Turns off]
- But...

07:10.490 --> 07:12.330
An elementary knowledge
of the Railway Acts...

07:12.330 --> 07:14.000
would tell you that I am
perfectly within my rights.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.250
<i>Yeah, but we want to hear it.
There's more of us than you.</i>

07:16.250 --> 07:18.420
We're a community,
a majority vote.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.710
Up the workers
and all that stuff.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.500
Then I suggest
you take that damn thing...

07:21.500 --> 07:23.760
into the corridor, or
some other part of the train...

07:23.760 --> 07:25.630
where you obviously belong.

07:25.630 --> 07:28.090
Give us a kiss.

07:28.090 --> 07:30.510
Look, mister, we paid
for our seats, too, you know.

07:30.510 --> 07:33.390
I travel on this train
regularly, twice a week.

07:33.390 --> 07:35.230
Knock it off, Paul.
You can't win with his sort.

07:35.230 --> 07:36.890
After all, it's his train,
isn't it, mister?

07:36.890 --> 07:39.100
And don't take that tone
with me, young man.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.980
I fought the war for your sort.

07:40.980 --> 07:42.480
I bet you're sorry you won.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.280
- I shall call the guard.
- Ah, but what?

07:45.280 --> 07:47.400
They don't take kindly
to insults, you know.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.950
Let's go have some coffee
and leave the kennel to Lassie.

07:53.370 --> 07:54.700
[Door closes]

07:54.700 --> 07:56.500
<i>PAUL: Hey, mister,
can we have our ball back?</i>

08:00.960 --> 08:05.130
<i>PAUL: Look, mister! Mister!
Can we have our ball back?</i>

08:05.130 --> 08:08.130
<i>- JOHN: Hey!
- PAUL: Please, mister!</i>

08:12.600 --> 08:14.770
- You want to watch it.
- Well, it's not my fault.

08:14.770 --> 08:16.020
You stick to that story, son.

08:16.020 --> 08:18.560
I can't help it.
I'm just taller than you are.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.020
They always say that.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.480
Well, I've got me eye on ya.

08:21.480 --> 08:24.190
I'm sorry, Norm. I can't help
being taller than you.

08:24.190 --> 08:26.990
Well, don't rub it in! I've
a good mind to thump you, Shake.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.610
If you're gonna have a barney,
can I hold your coat?

08:28.610 --> 08:31.280
- He started it.
- I did not. You did.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.450
Well, what happened?

08:32.450 --> 08:33.620
The old fella said that...

08:33.620 --> 08:35.990
could he have these pictures,
and Norm said, "No."

08:35.990 --> 08:38.370
And all I said was,
"Well, why not be big about it?"

08:38.370 --> 08:40.460
- And?
- Your grandfather pointed out...

08:40.460 --> 08:43.210
that Shake was always being
taller than me just to spite me.

08:43.210 --> 08:44.710
I knew it. He started it.

08:44.710 --> 08:46.380
<i>- PAUL: I should've known.
- NORM: You what?</i>

08:46.380 --> 08:48.590
You two have never had
an argument in your life...

08:48.590 --> 08:50.720
<i>and in two minutes flat,
he's got you at it.</i>

08:50.720 --> 08:52.090
He's a king mixer.

08:52.090 --> 08:55.010
<i>He hates group unity,
so he gets everyone at it.</i>

08:55.010 --> 08:56.970
Well, I suggest
you just give him the photos...

08:56.970 --> 08:58.140
and have done with it.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.730
Oh, all right, you old devil.
Here you are.

09:03.520 --> 09:06.270
Hey, Pauly, would you ever
sign one of them for us?

09:06.270 --> 09:08.650
Ah, come out, Shake.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.960
<i>JOHN: Hey, look at the talent.
Let's give 'em a pull.</i>

09:19.960 --> 09:21.790
- Should I?
- Aye, but don't rush.

09:21.790 --> 09:24.500
None of your five bar gate
jumps and over sort of stuff.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.250
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I don't know.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.340
I thought it just sounded
distinguished-like.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.880
<i>JOHN: George Harrison,
the scouse of distinction.</i>

09:30.880 --> 09:32.050
Excuse me, madame.

09:34.590 --> 09:37.310
Excuse me, but these young men
I'm sitting with...

09:37.310 --> 09:39.680
wondered if two of us
could come over and join you.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.060
I'd ask you myself,
only I'm shy.

09:42.060 --> 09:44.940
I'm sorry, miss. You mustn't
fraternize with me prisoners.

09:44.940 --> 09:46.940
- Prisoners?
- Convict in transit.

09:46.940 --> 09:49.190
Typical old lads,
the lot of them.

09:49.190 --> 09:52.200
<i>Get out, ladies!
Get out while you can!</i>

09:56.910 --> 09:58.370
He's been gone a long time.

09:58.370 --> 10:00.370
- Who?
- Paul's grandfather.

10:00.370 --> 10:02.210
Oh, I didn't notice.
Where'd he go?

10:02.210 --> 10:04.830
- Down the, uh...
- Oh, down the, uh...

10:04.830 --> 10:06.170
Yeah, down the, uh...

10:06.170 --> 10:08.710
Oh, well, give him
a couple of minutes, then.

10:16.390 --> 10:18.760
Hey, have you seen
Paul's grandfather?

10:18.760 --> 10:20.970
Of course.
He's concealed about me person.

10:20.970 --> 10:22.850
Now, he must've slipped off
somewhere.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.560
- Have you lost him?
- Now, don't exaggerate.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.730
You've lost him!

10:25.730 --> 10:28.820
Look, put it this way, Pauly...
he's mislaid him.

10:28.820 --> 10:30.900
Honest, you can't trust you
with anything, Norm.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.530
If you've lost him,
I'll cripple ya.

10:32.530 --> 10:36.740
- He can't have got far.
- Let's look up the sharp end.

10:36.740 --> 10:38.660
What's the matter
with you, then?

10:38.660 --> 10:40.330
It's his grandfather.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.790
I can tell he doesn't like me.
It's 'cause I'm little.

10:42.790 --> 10:45.250
You've got an inferiority
complex, you have.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.920
Yeah, I know.
That's why I play the drums.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.090
It's me active
compensatory factor.

11:09.820 --> 11:11.270
Goin' in, then?

11:11.270 --> 11:12.990
No, she'll only
reject me in the end...

11:12.990 --> 11:14.190
and I'll be frustrated.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.410
You never know.
You may be lucky this time.

11:16.410 --> 11:17.910
No, I know
the psychological pattern.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.120
It plays havoc
with me drum skins.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.460
Excuse me. Have you seen that
little old man we were with?

11:29.460 --> 11:31.460
We've broken out...
the blessed freedom of it all.

11:31.460 --> 11:34.340
Have you got a nail file?
These handcuffs are killing me.

11:34.340 --> 11:37.470
I was framed! I'm innocent!
I don't want to go!

11:37.470 --> 11:39.260
Sorry for disturbing you,
girls.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.430
I bet you can't guess
what I was in for.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.600
Should we go in here?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.350
No, it's probably

No, that's too easy for Lennon.

just to upset me.

You're imagining it, Norm.

You're letting it
prey on your mind.

No. This is a battle of nerves

- Nerves.

at me... and in public, too.

42:34.030 --> 42:35.200
<i>GEORGE:
I'm terribly sorry...</i>

42:35.200 --> 42:37.370

some sort of misunderstanding.

42:37.370 --> 42:38.950
Oh, you can come off it
with us.

42:38.950 --> 42:41.080
You don't have to do the old
adenoidal glottal stop...

42:41.080 --> 42:42.500
and carry on for our benefit.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.170
I'm afraid I don't understand.

42:45.170 --> 42:46.460
Oh, my God. He's a natural.

42:46.460 --> 42:48.920
Well, I did tell them
not to send us real ones.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.300
They ought to know the phonies
are much easier to handle.

42:51.300 --> 42:53.720
Still, he's a good type.

We'd like you to give us
your opinion...

for that eventuality.

43:02.850 --> 43:04.650
Well, not your real opinion,
naturally.

43:04.650 --> 43:05.980
It'll be written out,
and you'll learn it.

43:05.980 --> 43:07.650
- Can he read?
- Of course I can.

43:07.650 --> 43:10.320
I mean lines, ducky.
Can you handle lines?

43:10.320 --> 43:11.990
- Well, I'll have a bash.
- Good.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.990
Give him whatever it is
they drink. A coke-a-rama?

43:14.990 --> 43:16.240
Ta.

43:16.240 --> 43:19.660

They're dead grotty.

- Grotty?
- Yeah, grotesque.

43:37.600 --> 43:41.220

and give it to Susan.

his utterly valueless opinion...

43:45.940 --> 43:47.730
when I know for a fact
that within a month...

43:47.730 --> 43:50.400
he'll be suffering from
a violent inferiority complex...

43:50.400 --> 43:51.860
and loss of status...

43:51.860 --> 43:54.360
because he isn't wearing
one of these nasty things.

43:54.360 --> 43:56.620
Of course they're grotty,
you wretched nit.

43:56.620 --> 43:58.700
That's why they were designed,
but that's what you'll want.

43:58.700 --> 44:00.240
I won't.

44:00.240 --> 44:01.410
You can be replaced,

I don't care.

And that pose is out, too,
Sonny Jim.

passionately and be right wing.

you won't meet Susan.</i>

44:11.000 --> 44:13.090

44:13.090 --> 44:17.050
Only Susan Campy

In fact, once we all sat down
and wrote these letters...

and all that rubbish.

44:32.780 --> 44:35.030
She's a trendsetter.
It's her profession.

Get him out. He's knocking
the program's image.

- Sorry about the shirts.
- Get him out!

44:50.750 --> 44:52.460
You don't think
he's a new phenomenon, do you?

44:52.460 --> 44:54.760
You mean an early clue
to the new direction?

Oh, no, no, no. It's all right.

The change isn't due
for three weeks yet.

All the same, make a note
not to extend Susan's contract.

- 102/3.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.210
There you are, then,
and don't be rolling at people.

01:02:13.210 --> 01:02:16.050
Oh, you can have it. I'm
packing it in. It depresses me.

01:02:16.050 --> 01:02:18.050
- Y'what?
- You heard. It gets on my wick.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:20.050
That's lovely talk, that is.
And why aren't you at school?

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.800
- I'm a deserter.
- Are you now?

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.970
- Yeah, I've blown school out.
- Just you?

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:27.140
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon,
and Ding Dong.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.060
- Oh, Ding Dong bell, eh?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:32.060
They was supposed to come
with us, but they chickened.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.650
<i>RINGO: Yeah? And they're
your mates, are they?</i>

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.820
Yeah.

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:36.320
<i>RINGO: Not much cop
without 'em, is it?</i>

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.320
- Oh, it's all right.
- Yeah? What are they like?

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.410
<i>BOY: Ginger's mad.
He says things all the time.</i>

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.330
And Eddy's good
at spitting and punching.

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.580
Yeah?
How about Ding Dong?

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.250
Oh, he's a big head.
He fancies himself, you know.

01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:48.830
<i>He's all right, though,
'cause he's one of the gang.</i>

01:02:48.830 --> 01:02:50.170
Hmm.

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:53.090
- Why aren't you at work?
- I'm a deserter, too.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.250
- Oh.
- Hey, Charlie!

01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:58.470
See ya!

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:17.480
<i>MAN: Come in, number seven.
Your time's up.</i>

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:24.030
I'm sorry, boys.
I didn't mean it, honest.

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:29.620
If he says that again,
I'll strike him.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.960
Oh, don't worry. They're
good lads. They'll be back.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.290
Well, we've only twenty minutes
to the final run-through.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.420
I meant no harm.

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.840
I was only trying to encourage
little Ringo to enjoy himself.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:46.600
God knows what you've unleashed
on the unsuspecting south.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.430
It'll be wine, women, and song
all the way with Ringo...

01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:50.560
when he gets the taste for it.

01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.410
That was fresh this morning.
Two and nine.

01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:46.410
[Parrot screeching]

01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:52.870
- Right. On your way.
- You what?

01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:55.750
You heard. On your way.
Troublemaker!

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.260
Hey, watch it!

01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:10.930
- Shake.
- What?

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:13.270
Worry, will you?

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:17.060
Well, that's it. Two minutes
to the final run-through.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.730
- They're bound to miss it now.
- I'll murder that Lennon.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:22.110
We could survive a missed
run-through as long as they...

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:23.940
<i>SHAKE: As long as
they end up for the show?</i>

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.200

<i>NORM: Shut up, cheerful.</i>

You don't think...
Oh, oh, oh no.

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:33.080
- Now, look, don't worry.
- They can't do this to me, no.

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:35.830
It's all your fault.
Oh, yes, it is.

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:37.870
If they don't turn up
I wouldn't be in your shoes...

01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:39.750
For all the tea in China.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.500
Oh, you're right there.
Neither would it.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:44.090
- You dirty traitor.
- Well, of course.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.840
Yes, of course.

- Did you want something?
- I could eat the lot of you.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:54.350
You'd look great
with an apple in your gob.

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.190
Do you realize you could have
missed the final run-through?

01:05:57.190 --> 01:05:58.480
Oh, we're sorry about that.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.230
Norm?
There's only three of 'em.

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:01.570
Oh, we were
looking for Ringo...

01:06:01.570 --> 01:06:04.070
but we realized
he must've come back here.

01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:06.740

Aye, well, we'll look
in the dressing room.

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:17.580
- Shake.
- Yes, the dressing room.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:18.750
Hey, where's my grandfather?

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:20.750
Don't worry about him, Paul.
He can look after himself.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:21.920
I suppose so.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.090

You're making a disturbance.

You've got to let me go.
I'm Ringo.

Yeah, that's what
they all say these days.

Look, I don't care who you are.

01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:38.750
You can save that

- Here you are, sarge.
- All right. What is he?

01:07:41.540 --> 01:07:42.960
Yeah, I got a little list here.

Yeah, a proper
little aborigine.

- I demand to see my solicitor.
- What's his name?

01:07:57.060 --> 01:07:59.770

- I know your game!

Ah, sure, that's what

No, not for me. Please don't.

So you just
brought the old chap...

out of the crowd
for his own good, eh?

01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:37.240
Well, he was getting
a bit nasty, you see...

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.569
so we had to bring him in.

01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:40.240
Well, he can't stop here.

- Photographs.

Only half an hour,

- Can I say something?
- Yes. Anything.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.100
It seems highly unlikely
we'll be on.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.860
I mean, the law of averages
are against it.

01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.280
I think if you could
get the juggler on...

with a couple more clubs...

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:17.570

- Yeah.

Lads. Lads! You're back!
Thank goodness. Where's Ringo?

- There he is. We got him.
- Great, great, great.

You don't know
what this means to me.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:07.130
If you hadn't come back,
it would have meant...

the epilogue

Hey, aren't you
supposed to be in that box?

two-faced John McCartney.</i>

Aw, leave him alone.
He's back, isn't he?

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:22.190
- It's not his fault he's old.
- What's old got to do with it?

01:14:22.190 --> 01:14:24.860
He's a troublemaker and a mixer.
That's good enough for me.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:27.150
You're right. He's only asking
for attention, aren't you?

01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:29.160
You see, you know your trouble.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:31.070
You should've gone west

You're a lonely old man

- What?

I've been thinking.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.880
- It's not my fault.
- What isn't?

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.920
I'm not taller than you are.
You're smaller than I am.

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.680
Anyone at home?

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.390
Hey, Shake, where's me boot?

01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:53.220
Will you get us some tea

[Audience screaming]

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:41.020
Now, I've got the stuff.
Come here, lads.

01:24:41.020 --> 01:24:42.230
- Aren't we going...
- No, we're not.

01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:43.940
The office has been on
the phone and think it's best...

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:45.730
if we push on to Wolverhampton
straight away.

01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:47.860
- Tonight? We'll never make it.
- You've got a midnight matinee.

01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:49.030
Aye, Norm!

01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:51.570
There's only one thing I've got
to say to you, John Lennon.

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:53.780

01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:12.510
Come on,
you're hanging up the parade!

01:25:13.880 --> 01:25:15.050
Get rid of those things!

01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:17.970
