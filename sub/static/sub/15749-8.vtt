00:01.843 --> 00:04.703
If you could just see it fit
to give her a reference...

00:04.704 --> 00:07.624
Why don't you try your hand at
something else? Like what?

00:07.625 --> 00:09.264
Serious acting.

00:10.265 --> 00:12.382
I gave you my childbearing years.

00:12.383 --> 00:14.344
You understand that, don't you,
Roger?

00:14.345 --> 00:16.744
I'd be lost without you.

00:16.745 --> 00:18.844
Come with me to Paris. No.

00:50.652 --> 00:54.250
I want everything perfect for this
evening, Fraser. Of course, sir.

00:54.251 --> 00:57.450
And all the staff understands that?
They do indeed, Mr Selfridge.

00:57.451 --> 01:00.810
Mr Woolworth is an American
gentleman, I believe... Yes.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.331
And I told you he likes his mutton
very well done. You did indeed, sir.

01:17.812 --> 01:21.051
And I don't want any fuss.
Everything natural. Of course, sir.

01:21.052 --> 01:23.051
Everything natural.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.291
Hello.

01:29.292 --> 01:32.171
Hello, dear Rose. Jennie, welcome.

01:32.172 --> 01:34.730
So glad you could come.

01:34.731 --> 01:37.091
You look so well. Rosalie.

01:37.092 --> 01:39.010
How are you? Frank. Rose.

01:39.011 --> 01:42.011
So nice to see you. Welcome. Thank
you. Come in.

01:42.012 --> 01:43.730
Rosalie. Hello.

01:43.731 --> 01:45.731
Frank.

01:46.811 --> 01:48.809
Nice place you've got here, Harry.

01:48.810 --> 01:51.970
Rented? I could have bought it, of
course, but - Sure you could.

01:51.971 --> 01:54.409
I didn't wanna tie up all my capital
in real estate.

01:54.410 --> 01:57.731
You don't have to explain to me,
Harry, you're a big boy now.

02:00.452 --> 02:02.052
Bed.

02:04.532 --> 02:08.370
Well, my heart was in my mouth, as
you can imagine.

02:08.371 --> 02:12.570
My first soiree!
But Lady Mae was wonderful.

02:12.571 --> 02:15.452
She introduced me to so many people
I lost count.

02:16.491 --> 02:20.212
Our Edna's getting married to a New
York City stockbroker.

02:21.291 --> 02:24.732
One of the wealthiest and most
influential fellas - Oh, Frank.

02:24.733 --> 02:26.771
Stop it.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.250
Nothing wrong with a little
bragging.

02:29.251 --> 02:31.692
Harry and I both came up the hard
way.

02:32.731 --> 02:34.731
Children are our legacy.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.891
Here's to them.

02:42.372 --> 02:44.972
You seem to have settled in just
fine, Rose.

02:44.973 --> 02:48.492
We have, although I miss family and
friends.

02:53.731 --> 02:57.650
Well... we may be here a great deal
more.

02:57.651 --> 02:59.491
Really?

02:59.492 --> 03:01.849
FW's store did so well
in Liverpool,

03:01.850 --> 03:04.172
he's planning to open them all over
England.

03:04.173 --> 03:07.252
But, er, you don't want him to?

03:09.171 --> 03:12.211
FW doesn't stop. I don't think he
knows how to.

03:12.212 --> 03:14.571
Harry has the same problem.

03:14.572 --> 03:16.572
I hope not.

03:18.691 --> 03:20.692
Jennie, are you quite well?

03:23.572 --> 03:25.371
You know...

03:26.572 --> 03:29.611
..I think I liked it better when we
were just starting up.

03:30.651 --> 03:34.532
It was hard, but we were together
and happy.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.690
So when does the Brixton store open
up?

03:46.691 --> 03:48.330
A couple of weeks.

03:48.331 --> 03:52.571
And then? I'm taking one step at a
time. Mm.

03:55.772 --> 03:58.490
I heard you were thinking about
central London.

03:58.491 --> 04:01.092
Oxford Street to be exact. Is that
true?

04:03.012 --> 04:05.050
Wouldn't it be kind of neighbourly?

04:05.051 --> 04:07.210
Two old Yankees, cosying up
together?

04:07.211 --> 04:10.650
Could be kind of painful - your
prices undercutting mine.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.249
Our stores don't attract the same
customers.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.611
Yours is for the wealthy,
mine is for the thrifty.

04:16.612 --> 04:20.690
Selfridges is for anyone and
everyone.

04:20.692 --> 04:23.009
Anybody who can afford your stiff
prices.

04:23.010 --> 04:25.049
When you and I were growing up,

04:25.050 --> 04:27.851
we couldn't even go into a place
like Selfridges,

04:27.852 --> 04:29.972
let alone buy anything there.

04:31.372 --> 04:36.411
Face it, Harry, you cater to the
carriage trade, these days.

04:36.412 --> 04:38.770
I'm still a five and dime guy.

04:38.771 --> 04:42.572
I reckon the West End's big enough
to hold us both.

04:43.652 --> 04:45.451
What do you say, Harry?

04:52.252 --> 04:54.252
Good night.

04:59.812 --> 05:01.812
Thanks again.

05:15.212 --> 05:17.212
Good morning. Good morning.

05:19.172 --> 05:21.009
Good morning, Miss Ravillious.

05:21.010 --> 05:23.690
Look to it, Miss Towler.
Mr Selfridge is on the floor.

05:23.691 --> 05:27.012
Good morning, ladies. Morning, Mr
Selfridge. Morning, Mr Selfridge.

05:27.013 --> 05:29.051
I have a challenge for you.

05:29.052 --> 05:31.090
What can I buy with this?

05:31.091 --> 05:33.210
Well, er, well, nothing, Mr
Selfridge.

05:33.211 --> 05:36.369
If it were a sixpence, we have some
rather pleasant handkerchiefs.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.651
I don't have a sixpence, I have a
thrupenny bit.

05:38.652 --> 05:40.651
Well...

05:42.331 --> 05:45.730
Miss Ravillious, Miss Towler, what
can you offer me?

05:45.731 --> 05:47.929
A thrupenny bit wouldn't buy you
half a button

05:47.930 --> 05:50.171
on any of our fashion pieces, Mr
Selfridge.

05:51.251 --> 05:55.771
Does anyone have anything that they
can sell me for this?

05:56.891 --> 05:58.731
Yes?

05:58.732 --> 06:02.731
You can buy a bag of bull's-eyes
for a penny in confectionery,
Mr Selfridge.

06:10.851 --> 06:14.489
Freddie Squires. He's the eldest
son of Lord Squires.

06:14.490 --> 06:16.652
They have a large estate in
Northumberland.

06:17.851 --> 06:20.491
It's too far and cold.

06:20.492 --> 06:22.851
We should stick to the Home
Counties.

06:23.971 --> 06:25.971
Well, there's Robin Brackenbury.

06:25.972 --> 06:27.930
He's a Viscount.

06:27.931 --> 06:31.130
He's terribly stupid, but that can
be a benefit.

06:31.131 --> 06:33.692
I'm sorry, what are you talking
about?

06:33.693 --> 06:35.411
The next step.

06:35.412 --> 06:37.092
A suitable young man.

06:41.172 --> 06:44.690
When Rosalie eventually marries,

06:44.691 --> 06:49.692
she will marry for love, not for
money, or a title.

06:50.972 --> 06:52.972
How lucky she is.

06:54.771 --> 06:58.652
Most mothers use their children to
make their mark on the world.

06:58.653 --> 07:00.971
It's what I would have done.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.690
Do you know, Rosalie is very
fortunate

07:06.691 --> 07:09.290
that you've taken such an interest
in her.

07:09.291 --> 07:13.172
But you now feel that that interest
should come to an end?

07:13.173 --> 07:16.410
No, not at all. No, maybe you're
right.

07:16.411 --> 07:19.372
Why not introduce her to some
eligible young men?

07:19.373 --> 07:21.611
There can't be any harm to it.

07:21.612 --> 07:25.330
You are coming to my soiree,
tomorrow evening? I am.

07:25.331 --> 07:27.732
Well, then, do bring the dear girl
along.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.289
The decision as to who will become
Senior Assistant will be made this
week.

07:36.290 --> 07:39.009
I will interview you both over the
next two days.

07:39.010 --> 07:41.212
Thank you, Mr Grove. Thank you, Mr
Grove.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.411
How often does Mrs Crabb shop here?

07:53.412 --> 07:57.652
Mrs Crabb keeps a tight rein on the
household economy, Mr Selfridge.

07:57.653 --> 07:59.691
No luxury items.

07:59.692 --> 08:03.091
She generally confines
her purchases to household goods.

08:03.092 --> 08:07.290
Mmm. But we have household goods
here.

08:07.291 --> 08:08.931
Erm...

08:08.932 --> 08:12.290
We don't price them keenly enough.
Is that what you're saying?

08:12.291 --> 08:15.090
She is a very thrifty woman, Mr
Selfridge.

08:15.091 --> 08:17.091
But she will be shopping here.

08:18.972 --> 08:21.329
She did mention paying a visit,
yes.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.932
So the old man's stealing a march on
me.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.971
We'll see about that.

08:35.863 --> 08:40.341
I would like to try discounting
certain items all around the store,
just as an experiment.

08:40.342 --> 08:42.640
But it is that the image we want to
project?

08:42.659 --> 08:44.918
Selfridges is for anyone and
everyone.

08:44.955 --> 08:46.994
Umbrellas, Miss Mardle.
Umbrellas, Mr Selfridge?

08:47.036 --> 08:48.957
Yes, it's raining cats and dogs
outside.

08:48.958 --> 08:51.796
Drop the prices 50%. 50%, Mr
Selfridge?

08:51.797 --> 08:54.915
Why not? It's not just about pushing
products,

08:54.916 --> 08:57.595
it's about encouraging people
through the doors.

08:57.596 --> 09:00.475
Perhaps, if this goes well,
we could make a big event of it?

09:00.476 --> 09:02.795
Hold a mid-season sale, not just at
New Year?

09:02.796 --> 09:05.235
Miss Mardle, I love it. That's a
great idea.

09:05.236 --> 09:07.275
If we do it,
it must look beautiful.

09:07.276 --> 09:10.595
Simple items, displayed well.
Windows. Of course.

09:10.596 --> 09:13.797
Sort through your stock and figure
out which items to discount.

09:13.798 --> 09:15.676
Good luck to you all.

09:15.677 --> 09:19.955
Mr Selfridge, I have to talk with
you on a rather delicate matter.

09:19.956 --> 09:23.157
Miss Bunting, late of fashion - I
know who Miss Bunting is.

09:23.158 --> 09:26.396
It seems she has fallen on rather
hard times.

09:26.397 --> 09:29.795
If we could only write her a
reference of some sort -

09:29.796 --> 09:32.437
I don't write references for people
who are dishonest.

09:32.438 --> 09:34.437
There you have it. I'm sorry.

09:43.397 --> 09:45.397
We've got trouble.

09:47.077 --> 09:49.077
Put them somewhere discreet.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.597
Very good to see you at the Palm
Court again, Miss Love.

09:53.598 --> 09:55.436
Thank you, Mr Colleano.

09:55.437 --> 09:57.637
If you come this way, I'll get you
seated.

10:04.717 --> 10:08.437
I'd like my old table, in the
middle.

10:13.677 --> 10:15.757
This is where Mr Selfridge usually
sits.

10:17.677 --> 10:19.757
Well, he's not there now, is he?

10:19.758 --> 10:21.796
But he will be soon, Miss.

10:21.797 --> 10:23.836
It's his morning rounds.

10:23.837 --> 10:27.837
Well, you can move me when he
arrives, can't you?

10:35.597 --> 10:37.876
How did it go? Oh, he's a pet.

10:37.877 --> 10:39.716
He was ever so nice to me.

10:39.717 --> 10:42.677
I thought he was gonna offer me the
job there and then.

10:42.678 --> 10:44.677
Best of luck.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.117
Miss Millar...

10:54.917 --> 10:56.556
..in you come.

10:56.557 --> 11:01.597
So, what do you think you would
bring to the role of Senior
Assistant?

11:06.677 --> 11:08.677
Well, I'm good with customers.

11:08.678 --> 11:10.677
They like me.

11:11.877 --> 11:15.197
And so do other staff. That's
important, isn't it?

11:15.198 --> 11:17.237
It is indeed.

11:18.957 --> 11:20.997
Where do you see your career going?

11:20.998 --> 11:22.997
Going?

11:25.557 --> 11:28.715
Would you like to become Head of
Department, for example?

11:28.716 --> 11:32.037
I used to think I would,
but I don't know any more.

11:33.157 --> 11:35.637
I don't want to end up like Miss
Bunting -

11:35.638 --> 11:39.676
no husband, no children, no-one to
look after her.

11:39.677 --> 11:42.757
Miss Bunting's situation is quite
unusual. I want family.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.956
Is that so very wrong?

11:46.957 --> 11:50.237
No. No, it isn't.

11:51.717 --> 11:54.117
I've just talked myself out of a
job, haven't I?

11:54.118 --> 11:56.156
Not necessarily.

11:56.157 --> 11:58.597
I do appreciate your honesty.

12:00.557 --> 12:03.397
Now, I have to be honest with you.

12:05.037 --> 12:08.517
I'm afraid Mr Selfridge has refused
to give Miss Bunting a reference.

12:09.757 --> 12:11.757
I did try.

12:12.997 --> 12:14.997
I'm sure you did your best.

12:22.757 --> 12:24.796
Thank you, Miss Millar.

12:24.797 --> 12:27.397
Thank you, Tony. What a
treat.

12:38.637 --> 12:42.195
We need to discuss the menus for the
duration of the sale, Mr Perez.

12:42.196 --> 12:45.755
I hadn't envisaged them changing,
Mr Selfridge. Well, I have.

12:45.756 --> 12:49.115
There'll be people with less money
in their pocket. What can we offer?

12:49.116 --> 12:51.837
The Palm Court is already busy,
without accommodating...

12:52.877 --> 12:54.955
..well, less salubrious customers.

12:54.956 --> 12:57.475
We need special offers in every
department.

12:57.476 --> 12:59.515
If Woolworths do it, so can we.

12:59.516 --> 13:01.795
We could think about
a new set menu, Mr Perez.

13:01.796 --> 13:04.075
The menu is not your concern, Mr
Colleano.

13:04.076 --> 13:05.915
I want to make food accessible

13:05.916 --> 13:08.037
to everyone who walks through those
doors.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.437
Now, is my table ready? Harry.

13:19.157 --> 13:21.396
Why, Mr Selfridge.

13:21.397 --> 13:23.397
Miss Love.

13:26.117 --> 13:28.117
Travers. Selfridge.

13:30.517 --> 13:32.556
Tony's brought me shopping.

13:32.557 --> 13:35.757
Although I'm no longer
'the Spirit of the store',

13:35.758 --> 13:38.196
I hope I'm still welcome.

13:38.197 --> 13:41.317
Of course you are and how have you
been since... Well, I heard...

13:43.277 --> 13:45.636
..that you left the Gaiety.

13:45.637 --> 13:47.676
The Gaiety, yes.

13:47.677 --> 13:51.076
That seems like
a very long time ago now.

13:51.077 --> 13:53.077
Another life.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.877
Before Tony.

13:58.077 --> 14:00.757
Miss Love's taking a principal role
in my new play.

14:00.758 --> 14:02.796
She's absolutely brilliant.

14:02.797 --> 14:04.797
Oh, darling. It's true.

14:07.797 --> 14:09.556
We open in a few weeks.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.437
You should come along, you might
enjoy it.

14:12.438 --> 14:14.437
I'm sure that I would.

14:16.517 --> 14:18.517
It was good seeing you both.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.635
Next time they come in, let me know.

14:25.636 --> 14:28.317
I don't wanna bump into them. Very
good, Mr Selfridge.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.677
Mm. Very good.

14:42.797 --> 14:45.397
But when would I serve them?

14:46.677 --> 14:48.435
Wait until the guests are getting
hot

14:48.436 --> 14:50.635
and running out of things
to say to each other.

14:50.636 --> 14:53.037
Bring them in on trays.
Make them an event.

14:54.397 --> 14:56.435
Yes, I suppose that would work.

14:56.436 --> 14:59.675
And say the best confectionery chef
in town's made them.

14:59.676 --> 15:01.917
Might find a backer for our new
restaurant.

15:05.157 --> 15:07.757
There's a place come up in Windmill
Street.

15:07.758 --> 15:09.757
I'd like to show it to you.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.957
You're not expecting me to go to
Soho, are you?

15:15.157 --> 15:17.197
If we don't move fast, it'll go.

15:17.198 --> 15:20.316
Victor, don't rush me, dear heart.

15:20.317 --> 15:22.517
You know I hate to be rushed.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.317
Instruct the kitchen about the ice
cream.

15:27.797 --> 15:30.555
Oh, and then let yourself out the
back way.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.157
We don't want you bumping into the
guests, do we?

15:54.037 --> 15:56.757
Oh, look, let me help you. No, it's
done.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.757
Take a seat.

16:01.517 --> 16:03.517
Supper was lovely, thank you.

16:04.557 --> 16:06.596
You're being polite.

16:06.597 --> 16:08.637
I'm a very bad cook.

16:23.317 --> 16:24.956
Cigarette?

16:24.957 --> 16:26.957
No, thank you.

16:30.037 --> 16:32.397
It's beautiful. Mm.

16:34.877 --> 16:36.916
What is it?

16:36.917 --> 16:39.837
It's an opera called La Boheme.

16:41.597 --> 16:43.636
What's it about?

16:43.637 --> 16:45.517
Two students.

16:46.597 --> 16:48.677
Very poor, very much in love.

16:51.397 --> 16:55.957
You see everything like a story, or
a play, don't you?

16:56.957 --> 16:59.757
Design needs story.

17:00.877 --> 17:03.277
And creativity, it is play.

17:04.797 --> 17:07.237
One day, I want to have a job like
yours.

17:08.517 --> 17:10.757
You're using me, Miss Towler!

17:12.717 --> 17:15.436
You pretend to like me, because you
want my job!

17:17.597 --> 17:19.637
You found me out.

17:49.997 --> 17:51.997
Much better.

17:53.277 --> 17:55.477
You're quite beautiful, you know
that?

18:06.277 --> 18:08.316
You want this?

18:08.317 --> 18:10.356
You're sure?

18:10.357 --> 18:12.357
Yes, I do.

18:24.917 --> 18:27.955
What if I make an idiot of myself,
out with you and Pa?

18:27.956 --> 18:31.317
Then we'll go home and laugh about
it. But you won't.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.357
Ready?

18:46.917 --> 18:49.077
Here you are. How lovely.

18:50.237 --> 18:53.957
Rosalie, I have some young people
who are dying to meet you.

18:57.797 --> 19:01.277
Robin Brackenbury, and his younger
brother, Richard,

19:01.278 --> 19:03.716
this is Rosalie Selfridge.

19:03.717 --> 19:06.637
Can I get you a glass of champagne,
Miss Selfridge?

19:06.638 --> 19:08.637
No, let me.

19:15.677 --> 19:18.437
Now, who do you both know?

19:20.477 --> 19:23.635
But, of course, your old friend
from across the water.

19:23.636 --> 19:27.155
FW's here. He told me he's building
a skyscraper in New York.

19:27.156 --> 19:30.075
It'll be the tallest in the whole
city. Can you imagine?

19:30.076 --> 19:32.357
Well, he isn't short of a dime or
two.

19:32.358 --> 19:35.516
He's vying for your crown,
isn't he, Harry?

19:35.517 --> 19:39.197
London can accept one American king
of commerce, but two?

19:39.198 --> 19:41.477
Oh, it's de trop...

19:43.237 --> 19:45.957
Well, Harry, you're coming to the
big opening?

19:46.957 --> 19:49.397
I'll try my best to be there.
I might be busy.

19:49.398 --> 19:53.276
Our sale opens the door before. A
sale, at Selfridges?

19:53.277 --> 19:55.116
That I've gotta see.

19:55.117 --> 19:56.956
Is that so very surprising?

19:56.957 --> 19:59.835
Well, it doesn't seem like
that sort of establishment.

19:59.836 --> 20:03.395
Doesn't ring any registers, if you
know what I mean.

20:03.396 --> 20:06.557
That's a matter of opinion. How do
you cut your prices to the bone?

20:06.558 --> 20:10.596
Buy in bulk, squeeze your suppliers
to the lowest price.

20:10.597 --> 20:12.635
Pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap.

20:12.636 --> 20:14.797
Big turnover, small profit margin.

20:14.798 --> 20:19.276
It's not magic, but it takes
experience to do it right.

20:19.277 --> 20:22.996
Mm. Oh, and... forget the fancy
service.

20:22.997 --> 20:25.516
Let your customer help himself.

20:25.517 --> 20:29.355
Well, at Selfridges, shopping has to
be about quality service.

20:29.356 --> 20:31.717
Then you will never get your prices
low enough.

20:32.757 --> 20:35.797
Take my advice, stick with your
Duchesses, Harry.

20:35.798 --> 20:37.957
Leave the regular folk to me.

20:39.197 --> 20:42.715
Looking lovely this evening, Rose.
Thank you, Frank.

20:42.716 --> 20:45.877
I'm so sorry that Jennie couldn't
make it, this evening.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.316
Yeah, she isn't feeling tip-top.

20:48.317 --> 20:50.555
In fact, I should get back to her
pretty soon.

20:50.556 --> 20:54.035
I wonder how our girl is doing? I
should go and check on her. Yeah.

20:54.036 --> 20:56.117
Make sure she's all right. Thank
you.

21:14.197 --> 21:16.917
Well, I try to practise at home,
but I'm not very good.

21:18.637 --> 21:20.676
You do?

21:20.677 --> 21:22.716
Rosalie.

21:22.717 --> 21:24.756
Oh, Mother.

21:24.757 --> 21:27.237
This is... Roderick Temple.

21:30.717 --> 21:32.356
Hello.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.357
I thought you were in Paris.

21:36.797 --> 21:38.556
I got back last week.

21:38.557 --> 21:40.915
Of course, you know each other
already.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.317
Roddy did that lovely painting of
you.

21:43.318 --> 21:45.356
Rosalie?

21:45.357 --> 21:48.916
Oh. It was lovely meeting you.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.957
You too.

21:58.957 --> 22:03.317
I heard your paintings were well
received.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.997
You know,
I came here hoping to see you.

22:06.998 --> 22:09.036
What are you doing?

22:09.037 --> 22:11.076
I'm a married woman.

22:11.077 --> 22:13.116
Nothing happened.

22:13.117 --> 22:15.117
Nothing's going to happen.

22:18.397 --> 22:21.517
I am so very happy
for your success.

22:22.597 --> 22:24.957
Now, if you will please
excuse me...

22:26.277 --> 22:30.437
You have a very lovely daughter,
Mrs Selfridge.

22:38.597 --> 22:40.597
Where have you been hiding her?

23:11.297 --> 23:14.377
Come along or we'll be late. Do you
have your prayer book, Beatrice?

23:14.378 --> 23:16.537
Yes. Gordon? Yeah.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.636
Where's Rosalie? She has a headache.

23:20.658 --> 23:22.818
She's asked to be excused from
church.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.818
Quickly now.

23:35.698 --> 23:39.258
Josie. I was just sorting through
some of Hettie's things.

23:40.458 --> 23:42.458
Perhaps I could help you.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.496
All the years we've known each
other,

23:58.497 --> 24:01.738
I've never been inside your house.
Well, here it is.

24:01.739 --> 24:03.738
My little retreat.

24:06.538 --> 24:08.538
It is rather chaotic, I'm afraid.
I'm...

24:09.538 --> 24:11.778
..sorting through some of her
clothes.

24:11.779 --> 24:13.817
I was erm...

24:13.818 --> 24:16.218
I was going to send these away to
charity,

24:16.219 --> 24:19.338
but I have a relative in need.

24:20.538 --> 24:22.538
I'm trying to see what's suitable.

24:24.258 --> 24:26.297
You're always so thoughtful.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.337
No, it just...

24:28.338 --> 24:30.738
Well, it seems a waste, to throw it
all away.

24:35.818 --> 24:37.778
I miss her so much.

25:15.658 --> 25:19.137
So this is Spitfield? Spitalfields.

25:19.138 --> 25:21.056
I'm amazed you've never been here.

25:21.057 --> 25:23.416
I thought you might get some
inspiration.

25:23.417 --> 25:25.936
This is where real people do their
shopping.

25:25.937 --> 25:29.138
And I am not a real person? That's
what you're saying?

25:29.139 --> 25:31.577
You? No.

25:31.578 --> 25:34.977
You're a fairy prince from a story
book.

25:34.978 --> 25:37.978
Well...
I'm take that as a compliment.

25:39.098 --> 25:42.416
Didn't you ever go to the markets
when you were a little kid?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.738
I bet they've got some good ones in
France.

25:44.739 --> 25:46.777
Oh, yes, they have,

25:46.778 --> 25:49.018
but mine wasn't that sort of
childhood.

25:49.019 --> 25:51.018
In your enchanted palace!

25:52.338 --> 25:54.377
It was a chateau, yes. Oh.

25:54.378 --> 25:58.258
And... there was no enchantment
there, believe me.

26:01.098 --> 26:05.178
Look, they cram every square inch
with stuff, don't they?

26:09.258 --> 26:11.258
Thank you.

26:17.738 --> 26:20.177
Hello, Victor. Blimey.

26:20.178 --> 26:22.418
You come into some money, or
something?

26:22.419 --> 26:24.457
All those flowers!

26:24.458 --> 26:27.337
They were going cheap, at the
market.

26:27.338 --> 26:30.977
So... So what are you doing here?

26:30.978 --> 26:32.978
Just thought I'd look you up.

26:34.098 --> 26:36.697
Well, Mrs Payne's at her sister's,

26:36.698 --> 26:40.137
so do you want to come in for a cup
of coffee?

26:40.138 --> 26:42.178
Yeah, lovely.

26:56.738 --> 26:58.338
Looks nice in here.

26:59.378 --> 27:01.378
Well, I've cheered it up a bit.

27:02.458 --> 27:06.137
Now... this isn't Italian, or
anything like that,

27:06.138 --> 27:08.178
not like you're used to.

27:10.218 --> 27:12.258
Ta.

27:19.578 --> 27:21.617
It's good. Thanks.

27:21.618 --> 27:23.618
Just what the doctor ordered.

27:25.338 --> 27:27.377
Are you all right, Victor?

27:27.378 --> 27:29.618
Me? I'm fine.

27:30.618 --> 27:32.618
Never better.

27:34.698 --> 27:37.258
So how is your restaurant plan
going?

27:37.259 --> 27:40.337
Still got your mysterious investor
on board?

27:40.338 --> 27:42.377
Ah, that.

27:42.378 --> 27:44.777
I don't think she was ever serious.

27:44.778 --> 27:46.817
Oh, I am sorry.

27:46.818 --> 27:50.057
Not as sorry as me.
What a fool I've been.

27:50.058 --> 27:53.297
'Come here, Victor. Good boy.
Sit up and beg.

27:53.298 --> 27:55.176
Roll over and I'll give you a
biscuit.'

27:55.177 --> 27:59.218
So I sat up, I begged, I roll over
and, do you know what? No biscuit.

27:59.219 --> 28:03.297
It's so mean. So what... what
are you gonna do now, then?

28:03.298 --> 28:05.856
I'm gonna get that restaurant
in the end

28:05.857 --> 28:09.096
and, when I do, it'll be the best
place in town.

28:09.097 --> 28:11.978
Can't keep Victor Colleano down,
can they?

28:11.979 --> 28:13.978
Too right they can't.

28:18.658 --> 28:20.658
I have missed our Tuesday evenings.

28:24.498 --> 28:26.538
What is it?

28:27.538 --> 28:29.538
Roger?

28:31.538 --> 28:33.538
This is all wrong.

28:42.658 --> 28:44.658
Hettie's hardly in her grave.

28:46.338 --> 28:51.537
Here I am with you, in her house,
amongst her things.

28:51.538 --> 28:54.618
You're feeling guilty, but you
shouldn't.

28:55.858 --> 28:58.258
I broke my marriage vows for 12
years.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.538
You looked after her for 12 years.

29:06.058 --> 29:09.058
If I'd thought ever that you
actually loved her...

29:14.138 --> 29:16.098
I don't know any more.

29:18.738 --> 29:21.658
Perhaps we shouldn't see each other
for a while.

29:22.698 --> 29:26.338
It may become clearer how we feel.
I know how I feel.

29:26.339 --> 29:28.338
I'm sorry. Truly, I am.

29:31.658 --> 29:33.898
You must be patient with me, Josie.

29:36.258 --> 29:37.858
Yes.

29:38.898 --> 29:40.898
Yes, of course.

30:37.538 --> 30:39.538
Break it down to the stem.

30:40.818 --> 30:42.897
Here? Mm-hm. Right there.

30:42.898 --> 30:46.378
You have to make sure that it's
lighter on one side and then...

30:46.379 --> 30:49.177
Mother, you're back early.

30:49.178 --> 30:52.616
You were excused from church,
because I thought you were poorly.

30:52.617 --> 30:55.298
It appears you've made a remarkable
recovery.

30:56.658 --> 30:59.976
Mr Temple very kindly offered to
give me a drawing lesson.

30:59.977 --> 31:02.578
On a Sunday, when everybody's
out of the house?

31:03.618 --> 31:05.657
He's very busy.

31:05.658 --> 31:08.536
I'm putting on an exhibition at the
gallery.

31:08.537 --> 31:11.976
I was going to ask you if I could
show your portrait.

31:11.977 --> 31:14.178
I suggest we discuss that another
time.

31:15.258 --> 31:18.416
Mr Selfridge will be home soon
and I think he might question

31:18.417 --> 31:21.218
the propriety of
this so-called drawing lesson.

31:22.258 --> 31:24.258
I'll see you out.

31:33.698 --> 31:35.938
I hope to see you again, Miss
Selfridge.

31:37.978 --> 31:39.978
Your drawing shows great promise.

31:49.538 --> 31:51.578
What do you think you're doing?

31:53.658 --> 31:55.697
Rosalie asked me to come.

31:55.698 --> 31:57.337
She's very sweet.

31:57.338 --> 32:00.178
Don't you use her to get close to
me.

32:02.258 --> 32:04.737
I meet a charming girl at a soiree

32:04.738 --> 32:07.256
and she asks me to give her drawing
lessons.

32:07.257 --> 32:09.176
Is there anything wrong with that?

32:09.177 --> 32:12.658
Not if that were the whole truth,
but you know that it isn't.

32:14.738 --> 32:17.778
Oh, so do I have your permission to
call on her again?

32:18.778 --> 32:21.538
Certainly not. You must never come
here again.

32:21.539 --> 32:23.578
Do you understand?

32:26.258 --> 32:28.258
If that's the way you feel...

32:41.098 --> 32:43.177
Morning. Morning.

32:43.178 --> 32:45.178
Excuse me.

32:46.178 --> 32:48.336
Now, for my window,
Miss Ravillious -

32:48.337 --> 32:51.616
Are you proposing putting ladies
underwear in the window?

32:51.617 --> 32:55.176
Nothing would delight me more. What
a vision it could create.

32:55.177 --> 32:58.778
No, sadly convention decrees
otherwise. What a pity.

32:58.779 --> 33:00.617
So what do you suggest?

33:00.618 --> 33:02.658
Men's shoes.
I need a hundred pairs.

33:02.659 --> 33:06.138
Why? A friend took me to the East
End markets.

33:08.018 --> 33:10.417
It was inspiring. I see.

33:10.418 --> 33:13.257
Well, who are we to stand in your
way?

33:13.258 --> 33:15.696
Miss Towler, go to the men's
department

33:15.697 --> 33:18.178
and ask for 100 pairs of shoes
for Mr Leclair.

33:18.179 --> 33:20.177
Yes, Miss Ravillious.

33:20.178 --> 33:22.257
Thank you, Miss Towler.

33:22.258 --> 33:24.258
Thank you, Miss Ravillious.

33:29.178 --> 33:30.896
The point about the sale, Gordon,

33:30.897 --> 33:33.616
isn't just to sell goods cheaply,
it's more than that.

33:33.617 --> 33:36.896
I want hard-working, everyday people
to come in.

33:36.897 --> 33:39.536
I want everyone in London to feel
welcome here.

33:39.537 --> 33:42.616
Good morning, Miss Blenkinsop.
Good morning, Mr Selfridge.

33:42.617 --> 33:45.376
Mr Colleano from the Palm Court is
here to see you.

33:45.377 --> 33:48.176
He doesn't have an appointment. I
have a very busy morning,

33:48.177 --> 33:51.176
so I'll give you three minutes. It's
about ice cream. Ice cream?

33:51.177 --> 33:53.378
Sounds good, Pa.
Maybe I'll give you five.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.257
Excuse me, Miss Mardle.

34:01.258 --> 34:04.738
I need 1,000 handkerchiefs for my
window, please. All white.

34:09.178 --> 34:11.898
Well, you heard him, ladies. 1,000
handkerchiefs.

34:13.257 --> 34:16.098
What's got her? She's as grumpy as
a suet pud.

34:17.098 --> 34:21.777
Miss Millar, these are the clothes
for that charity that we discussed.

34:24.538 --> 34:26.378
Thank you, Mr Grove.

34:29.338 --> 34:33.178
Mr Grove, have you decided on the
Senior Assistant job yet?

34:33.179 --> 34:35.177
I have.

34:35.178 --> 34:38.697
Would you ask Miss Mardle to please
come to my office?

34:38.699 --> 34:40.737
I will give her my decision.

34:46.898 --> 34:48.577
Mr Perez is right.

34:48.578 --> 34:51.096
The Palm Court's gonna be packed
out during the sale,

34:51.097 --> 34:54.456
so I thought, 'Why don't we bring
the food to the customers?'

34:54.456 --> 34:58.098
We could sell it on trays all round
the store, like in the World Fairs.

34:58.099 --> 35:01.658
Candied fruit, ice cream cornets,
all for a penny.

35:02.858 --> 35:05.898
Pa, it's a great idea. We should
have hamburgers.

35:05.899 --> 35:08.897
Why not? Why the blazes not?

35:08.898 --> 35:10.657
Mr Colleano, I love it.

35:10.658 --> 35:12.936
You do whatever you need to do to
make it work.

35:12.937 --> 35:15.978
You tell Mr Perez, from me, this is
your show.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.698
Thank you, Mr Selfridge.

35:24.298 --> 35:26.618
Miss Mardle, thank you for being so
swift.

35:34.098 --> 35:38.016
I just thought we should resolve
the matter of the Senior Assistant.

35:38.017 --> 35:39.656
I interviewed both girls.

35:39.657 --> 35:43.378
I consider Doris Millar to be the
best girl for the job.

35:44.458 --> 35:46.497
Oh?

35:46.498 --> 35:48.816
Well, I must disagree with you
entirely.

35:48.817 --> 35:50.976
Miss Millar is a very nice, young
girl,

35:50.977 --> 35:53.016
but she has no drive, no ambition.

35:53.017 --> 35:55.338
Kitty Hawkins should have the post.

35:55.339 --> 35:57.698
May I ask why?

35:58.738 --> 36:01.217
She's sharper, harder.

36:01.218 --> 36:03.738
Which means she won't be taken
advantage of.

36:03.739 --> 36:05.777
Josie, please.

36:05.778 --> 36:07.776
May I ask if you've come to any
decision

36:07.777 --> 36:10.018
regarding the matter we spoke of on
Sunday?

36:11.298 --> 36:13.616
No, it's too soon, I'm afraid. I'm
sorry.

36:13.617 --> 36:15.938
Then please allow me to make this
decision.

36:17.018 --> 36:19.538
I think I know my staff better than
you do.

36:19.539 --> 36:21.737
And, if I may say so,

36:21.738 --> 36:24.778
I think I know my own mind rather
better than you know yours.

36:25.978 --> 36:27.778
You may be right.

36:31.298 --> 36:36.978
It was very close and you are both
extremely able young ladies.

36:38.018 --> 36:40.018
I have, however, decided.

36:41.378 --> 36:45.378
Miss Hawkins is to become Senior
Assistant to Miss Mardle.

36:45.379 --> 36:49.257
Thank you, Mr Grove.
Miss Mardle, I won't let you down.

36:49.258 --> 36:55.338
I'm going to be the best Senior
Assistant this store has ever seen.

36:59.098 --> 37:01.137
Very good.

37:01.138 --> 37:05.098
'Something for everyone.
The thrifty housewife's dream.'

37:06.138 --> 37:08.338
What do you say to that as a strap
line?

37:08.339 --> 37:10.657
Would Mrs Crabb bite?

37:10.658 --> 37:13.456
She's already very excited about
the sale. Excellent.

37:13.457 --> 37:16.656
That's exactly what I wanna hear.
Double our advertising space.

37:16.657 --> 37:18.336
Let the whole of London know

37:18.337 --> 37:21.058
there is something for everyone
at our mid-season sale.

37:24.658 --> 37:26.698
Good night. Night.

37:34.578 --> 37:36.578
Excuse me.

37:38.458 --> 37:40.458
Excuse - excuse me. Thank you.

37:44.778 --> 37:46.978
Excuse me, sir.
Thanks ever so much.

37:46.979 --> 37:49.618
I'm sorry. Thank you.

37:56.418 --> 37:59.217
Oh.

37:59.218 --> 38:01.257
Well, I hope they fit.

38:01.258 --> 38:03.458
I'm sure they will.

38:05.098 --> 38:08.058
You're a very kind girl, Doris,
thank you.

38:09.098 --> 38:12.858
Did Mr Grove get a chance to talk
to Mr Selfridge about my reference?

38:15.178 --> 38:18.338
I'm sorry, Miss Bunting, but Mr
Selfridge said no.

38:20.658 --> 38:22.657
I see.

38:22.658 --> 38:24.698
Well, of course he would.

38:25.858 --> 38:27.938
Nothing else he could say, I
suppose.

38:30.298 --> 38:32.298
I've got to go.

38:34.258 --> 38:36.458
Keep in touch, won't you? Yes.

38:38.498 --> 38:40.498
Yes.

38:54.979 --> 38:57.018
Well, this is it.

38:57.019 --> 39:00.218
Selfridges' first mid-season sale.

39:00.219 --> 39:02.257
Thank you all for your hard work.

39:02.258 --> 39:06.017
This sale has come from your ideas
and your initiative.

39:06.018 --> 39:09.179
I have one question before we open
those doors.

39:09.180 --> 39:14.379
Does anyone have anything they can
sell me for this?

39:19.339 --> 39:21.898
Ladies, please, an orderly line.

39:21.899 --> 39:24.778
I saw this first. I think I did.

39:24.779 --> 39:28.378
Ladies, we have other camisoles
just as beautiful.

39:28.379 --> 39:31.579
100% silk, made in France.

39:36.779 --> 39:39.058
I don't know. I just don't know.

39:39.059 --> 39:40.779
Oh, it suits you, madam.

39:42.339 --> 39:45.058
I don't normally wear
such big hats.

39:45.059 --> 39:48.179
Well, perhaps you should. Surprise
your husband.

39:48.180 --> 39:50.538
It's only four and 11 pence.

39:50.539 --> 39:52.218
Go on.

39:52.219 --> 39:54.259
I would.

40:03.059 --> 40:05.059
Thank you, sir.

40:31.379 --> 40:35.458
Mr Selfridge, I wanted to introduce
you to Mrs Crabb.

40:35.459 --> 40:39.498
Mrs Crabb, well, I'm so glad you
could come today.

40:39.499 --> 40:42.659
Are you enjoying yourself? Oh, yes,
Mr Selfridge.

40:42.660 --> 40:44.578
Found anything to buy?

40:44.579 --> 40:46.499
From nearly every department.

40:46.500 --> 40:50.458
Items that I wouldn't
normally consider to be quite 'us'.

40:50.459 --> 40:53.498
I'm afraid Mr Crabb's
going to get a shock.

40:53.499 --> 40:56.299
Your sales made me feel
quite adventurous.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.339
That's the idea.

40:59.579 --> 41:01.499
It is good to shop, isn't it?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.819
Mrs Crabb, it's very good.

41:05.939 --> 41:08.819
Here you are, madam. Thank you very
much. Thank you.

41:12.059 --> 41:13.978
Excuse me.

41:13.979 --> 41:16.938
FW, you made it.

41:16.939 --> 41:21.898
What do you think? I have to say,
Harry, this is swell.

41:21.899 --> 41:24.819
Let's hope all the ladies have
enough money in their purses

41:24.820 --> 41:26.858
for your opening tomorrow.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.899
We're putting the opening back.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.938
I need to take Jennie away.

41:30.939 --> 41:33.738
Nerves, you know how she gets.

41:33.739 --> 41:36.898
I'm so sorry. I should've noticed
earlier.

41:36.899 --> 41:38.899
I've been caught up with business.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.417
We're buying a new site in Croydon.
That's good.

41:42.418 --> 41:44.699
Nothing's good if Jennie's unhappy.

41:46.459 --> 41:49.259
Listen, if there's anything
that Rose and I can do...

41:49.260 --> 41:51.259
Thank you, old friend.

41:52.419 --> 41:54.459
I just looked in to say goodbye.

41:54.460 --> 41:59.658
Harry, all this, you know, it's
wonderful,

41:59.659 --> 42:01.859
but it's not what life's all about.

42:01.860 --> 42:03.898
Not really.

42:03.899 --> 42:07.779
Without your family, none of it
means a thing.

42:28.939 --> 42:32.739
I just wanted to give you the
figures for the day's takings, Mr
Selfridge.

42:32.740 --> 42:37.218
Truly exceptional. Every department
doubled its output.

42:37.219 --> 42:41.418
We may have cut our prices, but we
sold at huge quantity.

42:41.419 --> 42:43.337
We'll run the sale for two weeks

42:43.338 --> 42:45.857
and then do surprise discounts on
certain items.

42:45.858 --> 42:49.297
I'll get these figures put in the
ledger. No, we should both go home.

42:49.298 --> 42:52.419
You can see what surprises Mrs Crabb
has in store for you.

42:53.459 --> 42:56.139
She was talking about an automatic
nut cracker.

42:58.659 --> 43:01.699
Well done, Mr Crabb. Good night.

43:08.739 --> 43:10.779
Thank you. Goodbye.

43:24.859 --> 43:26.859
Good night.

43:33.179 --> 43:36.937
Such an interesting exhibition. I'm
so glad you persuaded me to go.

43:36.938 --> 43:39.897
Thank you, Fraser.
The children seem to be having fun.

43:39.898 --> 43:43.339
I think they find the young
gentleman very entertaining, madam.

43:43.340 --> 43:45.378
What young gentleman?

43:45.379 --> 43:47.419
Mr Temple, madam.

43:48.939 --> 43:50.979
You think it's this one? Yeah.

43:50.980 --> 43:53.018
You think it's this one?

43:53.019 --> 43:55.538
Aaah!

43:55.539 --> 43:57.578
Ma!

43:57.579 --> 44:00.419
Mr Temple, could I have a word with
you, in private?

44:06.179 --> 44:09.337
I can't believe that you would show
yourself here again.

44:09.338 --> 44:11.377
I can't seem to help myself, can I?

44:11.378 --> 44:14.699
Your younger children are quite
charming, by the way.

44:14.700 --> 44:16.738
You're not welcome here.

44:16.739 --> 44:19.699
If I were to tell my husband - But
you won't, will you?

44:21.299 --> 44:23.819
Because you have so much more to
lose than I do.

44:28.579 --> 44:30.619
Look, come to my studio, then...

44:32.259 --> 44:34.259
..then I won't have to come here.

44:36.619 --> 44:38.619
You're insufferable.

44:41.699 --> 44:43.738
Rosalie doesn't think so.

44:43.739 --> 44:46.378
Mr Temple?

44:46.379 --> 44:48.419
Think it over.

44:49.619 --> 44:51.659
Well, I must tear myself away.

44:51.660 --> 44:53.699
Thank you, Fraser.

44:54.699 --> 44:56.739
Good evening, Mrs Selfridge.

45:14.139 --> 45:16.699
Beautiful evening, sir. You're
right, it is.

45:23.219 --> 45:26.377
Half of London want to see how we
pay tribute to Sir Ernest
Shackleton.

45:26.378 --> 45:28.137
I'm not an easy man to impress,
Harry.

45:28.138 --> 45:31.257
There's staff missing from every
department. Where's our staff?

45:31.258 --> 45:35.219
Are you in love
with Mr Leclair? Agnes Towler.
Valerie Maurel.

45:35.220 --> 45:38.219
It's Roddy Temple.
I'll handle Mr Temple.
