WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:08.342
<i>So, um, how is everyone?</i>

00:10.260 --> 00:12.012
<i>You know,</i>
<i>my brother's being really funny.</i>

00:14.056 --> 00:17.059
<i>-He's kind of keeping it together, uh...</i>
-Right.

00:17.142 --> 00:20.687
<i>I'm gonna stay here for, uh...</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:23.440
<i>at least three weeks</i>
<i>and get everything cleaned out,</i>

00:23.523 --> 00:25.484
<i>'cause he's gotta go</i>
<i>and my sister's gotta be with her kids</i>

00:25.567 --> 00:26.944
<i>and so...</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:28.529
Okay.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.822
<i>I kind of got volunteered into it.</i>

00:30.906 --> 00:35.285
<i>It's all right with work and, um,</i>
<i>could be a good opportunity...</i>

00:35.369 --> 00:37.996
<i>you know, for you to clear out</i>
<i>your stuff and...</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:41.583
<i>not have me around trying</i>
<i>to convince you to stay.</i>

00:42.960 --> 00:44.920
<i>Unless you want to stay.</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:50.425
Uh...

00:51.843 --> 00:53.262
you know, we...

00:53.345 --> 00:56.139
I don't think that's gonna happen.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.601
<i>Well, you can take the few weeks.</i>
<i>When I get back, we can talk about it.</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:03.981
Uh, yeah, um...

01:04.064 --> 01:05.566
You know, I...

01:06.858 --> 01:10.070
I sort of feel like we already
had that conversation.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.491
Um...

01:17.578 --> 01:18.704
Yeah.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.588
<i>Come on, team.</i>

01:28.672 --> 01:29.798
Move the ball up the court.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.508
You're running around out there
like a bunch of girls.

01:31.591 --> 01:32.926
Coach Kendall, we are girls.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.261
Well, that's no excuse.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.097
You're 12 years old.
It's time to toughen up and grow a pair.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.265
Excuse me, Miss Kendall,

01:38.348 --> 01:39.766
but you can't speak to students that way.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.477
That's Coach Kendall.
And who asked you anyway?

01:42.561 --> 01:43.895
As vice principal of the school,

01:43.979 --> 01:46.481
I must insist that you stick
to the guidelines of teacher conduct.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.484
I have no idea
who wrote those guidelines,

01:49.568 --> 01:50.986
but I'm trying to prepare
these young women

01:51.069 --> 01:52.529
for success in the real world

01:52.613 --> 01:56.658
where they aren't gonna be coddled
by some namby-pamby vice principal.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.744
That-a-way, Rebecca, fight for that ball.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.995
No fighting, Rebecca,

02:00.078 --> 02:02.331
this is a non-violent,
safe space for learning.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.333
Are you gonna let me
coach my team or what?

02:04.416 --> 02:05.667
I came to tell you
that you missed

02:05.751 --> 02:07.169
the sensitivity training workshop
last week,

02:07.252 --> 02:09.254
so you need to schedule a make-up time.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.631
I'm not doing it.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.382
This school is already too sensitive.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.843
The parents have voted to make
the workshop mandatory.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.596
Then tell them they can talk to me
directly if they have a problem.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.473
They're all afraid of you,
Coach Kendall.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.559
Good. Rip her head off, Jenna!
Take her down!

02:26.730 --> 02:28.732
Sorry, I felt like that one
was really loud.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.151
Great. No, you know, that adds, like...
That we're, like, in a gym.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.111
-I love it. I love it. Fantastic.
-Okay. Cool, cool.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.780
-All right.
-That's it.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.156
That's it. I'm gonna send that.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.908
Okay. I mean, I can do
another one if, you know...

02:37.991 --> 02:40.243
No. No, I think...
Let's... let's keep it safe.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.912
-I love it. I love it.
-Okay.

02:41.995 --> 02:42.996
-Cool.
-Excellent.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.539
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.917
And your agent told you, right?
If... if you do get it,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.711
it requires a relocation to LA.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.047
-Oh, right, yeah. Um... yeah.
-Yeah.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.716
That... that'll be cool.
I mean, I can go wherever.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.658
Oh, my God, it's... it's over.

03:19.741 --> 03:20.784
- Excellent show.
- Whoo!

03:20.867 --> 03:23.412
-Excellent show.
-Jesus! What the fucking Christ?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.663
-Whoo!
-See you in the bar.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.831
Yep.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.209
Oh, my God.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.795
-Oh. Cheers, baby.
-Yes. Well, right?

03:31.878 --> 03:32.963
Mmm.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.216
<i>I just can't get over how...</i>

03:37.259 --> 03:38.927
<i>beautiful that show was...</i>

03:39.010 --> 03:40.220
- Oh, wow, great.
- ...and this role for you

03:40.303 --> 03:41.596
is just the best thing
I've seen you do.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.348
- Oh, thanks. Wow. Really?
- I do.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.100
- I really think it was just--
- Oh, that's awesome.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.518
That's great.
I've been having a lot of fun.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.729
Fantastic. I'm just...
I mean, I'm gonna tell everybody.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.064
-I'm... I'm so proud of you. I really am.
-Oh, thanks. Um, please do.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.483
Oh, hey, real quick. Cheryl, um,
this is my friend Cheryl, Sophie.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.527
-Hi. You were amazing.
-Hi.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.362
-Isn't she awesome? Yeah.
-Really, really nice to meet you.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.488
-Thank you. Thanks.
-Great job.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.615
Um, I... I can only stomach
about 20 minutes of this.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.617
I'm thinking let's go across
the street to Lincoln Station.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.827
Yeah, great.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.787
Grab a drink
across the street.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.414
<i>So, yeah, uh,</i>
<i>thanks for your message.</i>

04:07.497 --> 04:09.583
Yeah, the...
the show was great.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.836
It was really, really good, um, so...

04:12.919 --> 04:15.881
um, yeah, we're all heading out now,

04:15.964 --> 04:20.343
so, um, I probably won't
catch you tonight, but, um...

04:21.720 --> 04:23.889
maybe we can talk tomorrow. Um...

04:25.557 --> 04:29.019
I was thinking about you.
A lot. Um...

04:30.687 --> 04:34.065
Anyway, um, send everyone
my love and, um...

04:35.400 --> 04:36.693
Yeah.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.862
I love you.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.824
Okay. Bye.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.666
-Wonderful. Great performance.
-Oh, thank you.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.502
-Wonderful. Wonderful.
-You're welcome. Thank you.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.836
Thanks. Have a good night.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.546
-You, too. Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.964
<i>Um, hey, everybody,</i>

04:58.048 --> 05:00.217
<i>if I could, uh, just have your attention</i>
<i>for a quick second.</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:02.552
I just wanted to say that I'm so grateful.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.429
I'm... I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

05:04.513 --> 05:09.768
Getting to do this play,
getting to play John Dillinger in Chicago,

05:09.851 --> 05:13.688
right where he was shot and killed,
uh, is... is such an honor,

05:13.772 --> 05:15.982
and, um, you know, I just...

05:16.066 --> 05:19.569
To our incredible crew, who's working
so hard to put this thing on every night.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.280
To my castmates,
Annabelle, Sophie...

05:22.364 --> 05:24.741
You guys are the best.
I love you guys.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.327
Uh, here's to a great run.
Happy opening.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.204
- Cheers.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.331
Cheers.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.791
<i>With Drew, it was exactly that.</i>

05:32.874 --> 05:35.544
I mean, everybody's like,
it's the clichÃ© that, you know, the...

05:35.627 --> 05:38.296
It's the girl that wants to,
like, you know,

05:38.380 --> 05:39.923
have kids or whatever, and...

05:40.006 --> 05:42.217
and he was there,
he was at that point.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.386
-Mmm-hmm.
-And I just...

05:44.469 --> 05:46.054
- You weren't ready to do it?
- I feel like--

05:46.137 --> 05:50.225
Was it that you weren't ready to do it
or you weren't ready to do it with him?

05:51.351 --> 05:53.895
If I was 32 like you,
I would just be happy.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.982
I wouldn't be worried about a thing.
Not a thing.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.693
Not a thing. Like, if you...
If you were...

05:59.776 --> 06:03.363
If I was talking to you
and you were the me I was...

06:03.446 --> 06:06.074
what, 20-something years ago...

06:06.157 --> 06:08.910
I would...
I would just say to you...

06:09.953 --> 06:13.164
"Oh, man, like, you've got no problems."

06:13.248 --> 06:16.501
You know, and you can do
whatever you want. Right?

06:20.797 --> 06:23.383
<i>The director really likes you for this,</i>

06:23.466 --> 06:26.511
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>the network execs and everybody in LA</i>

06:26.595 --> 06:29.389
<i>really don't know you that well,</i>
<i>so I'm just trying to figure out</i>

06:29.472 --> 06:32.350
<i>would it be at all possible</i>
<i>to get you out to LA,</i>

06:32.434 --> 06:34.894
<i>maybe, so that they could</i>
<i>see you in person,</i>

06:34.978 --> 06:37.772
<i>maybe meet you and read you again,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

06:37.856 --> 06:40.108
<i>I know you're in the middle of the play,</i>

06:40.191 --> 06:43.445
<i>but is there a day that works,</i>
<i>maybe, that you can...</i>

06:43.528 --> 06:46.740
<i>get out to LA for 24 hours?</i>

06:46.823 --> 06:50.702
Uh, yeah, maybe if it was,
you know, on a Monday.

06:50.785 --> 06:53.079
You know, I could
go after the matinee, maybe.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.838
Oh, hey, Jo.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.758
Hi. What's up?

07:04.841 --> 07:07.135
-Oh, good. How are you?
-Good. Good to see you.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.470
You too.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.681
Oh, actually, Chase and I
got tickets to your show.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.392
-Oh. Amazing.
-Yes, we're gonna be there on Thursday.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.936
-Oh, great.
-We're so excited.

07:16.019 --> 07:18.063
-Yay. Okay, cool. You know, I'm...
-Yeah.

07:18.188 --> 07:20.732
I'm really glad I ran into you,
actually, 'cause, um,

07:20.815 --> 07:23.193
I'm actually moving out, so, um...

07:23.276 --> 07:24.694
-Really?
-Yeah, so I might not...

07:24.778 --> 07:26.863
-I might not see you much.
-Where... where are you guys moving?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.658
Uh, well,
Drew's still gonna be here,

07:29.741 --> 07:31.910
but, um, uh...

07:31.993 --> 07:34.788
Yeah, we, uh, just broke up.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.665
-So, I'm moving out.
-Wow.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.584
Finally dumped the butcher.
Been waiting for that.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.796
I've been rooting for you.
No, where are you off to?

07:43.713 --> 07:47.509
Oh, I don't actually know...

07:47.592 --> 07:49.219
uh, quite yet.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.845
Um...

07:50.929 --> 07:53.515
Yeah, I... I may do this job in LA,

07:53.598 --> 07:55.934
uh, that is a possibility,

07:56.017 --> 07:58.311
but, um, after that, I...

07:58.395 --> 08:00.397
If that doesn't work,
I don't know.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.523
Yeah, go be a star.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.233
You got the face for it.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.820
-I'll see you on Thursday. Yeah.
-All right.

08:10.573 --> 08:12.409
You want a cup of tea?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.536
- Uh, sure.
- Are you good for tea, Kyle?

08:14.619 --> 08:16.329
- Yeah, I'm good, thanks.
- Okay.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.914
My mind is my own.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.290
All right,
I'm gonna put my wig on.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.473
<i>I should probably finish</i>
<i>my ice cream over here.</i>

08:35.557 --> 08:37.892
-It's nice talking to you, Madeline.
-Say nice to meet you, too.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.478
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Mmm.

08:40.562 --> 08:43.189
Here, have a...
Have a drink of water, okay?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.275
Please?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.735
<i>But don't you just love that,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

08:46.818 --> 08:48.528
<i>you don't have to answer to anyone,</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:50.572
you don't have to clean anyone's,
like, underwear...

08:50.655 --> 08:51.990
- You don't have to, like...
- Yeah.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.159
...you know, cook dinner or like,

08:54.242 --> 08:58.955
you know, fulfill those, sort of,
stereotypical, like, wifey expectations.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.790
-Yeah.
-You know, you can just

09:00.874 --> 09:02.250
be an artist and...

09:02.333 --> 09:07.756
feel like you've got your whole self
just to explore, you know?

09:08.757 --> 09:09.966
Yeah.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.719
I mean, I get it.
I'm sure that gets boring after a while,

09:12.802 --> 09:16.306
but I'm just saying, like, you know,
for me, it's just been so long since...

09:17.223 --> 09:18.558
it's just been me.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.144
-Uh-huh.
-I sort of realized I don't really...

09:22.062 --> 09:25.774
know, like, how to be on my own.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.526
You know?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.249
But when you're on your own...

09:44.667 --> 09:46.753
-now, right?
-Yeah.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.004
You're...

09:48.088 --> 09:49.631
It's fun.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.716
-Oh, yeah, for sure.
-Yeah.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.259
I mean, I'm like, you know...

09:53.343 --> 09:55.929
I just started swimming.
You know, I haven't swum...

09:56.012 --> 09:58.723
-Yeah.
-...like, you know, since I was, like, 14.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.519
You know, I used to be really competitive
about it, and now I'm just, like...

10:02.602 --> 10:04.521
Just enjoying it.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.232
But, I mean, what about you?
I mean, like...

10:07.315 --> 10:09.692
You know, like, are you seeing anyone?

10:13.488 --> 10:16.783
Thanks a lot. Have a good night.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.334
- Hi.
- Good evening.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.419
-Uh, 18-A.
-18-A. What's the name?

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
-Uh, Annabelle.
-Annabelle.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.422
-You know where you're going, Annabelle?
-Yeah.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.383
- Okay, great.
- All right, thanks so much.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.907
Yeah. Hello.

10:57.991 --> 10:58.992
- Hello, Bella.
- Hi.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.870
I wasn't sure if this was the right one.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.997
It's the right one.
The one at the end of the hall.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.541
- I'm glad, I'm glad.
- You've been here before.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.044
Wow.
Yeah, that's right.

11:10.128 --> 11:13.256
It was day time.
I could see the lake, but now...

11:15.300 --> 11:18.761
Hey, Bella. What's going on?

11:18.845 --> 11:20.972
What happened...
what happened to the lake?

11:21.055 --> 11:22.640
Oh, it's there.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.435
It's not going anywhere.
Just like you.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.062
-Hi.
-Hi

11:28.146 --> 11:30.815
I... I have to take a quick, uh...

11:30.899 --> 11:34.068
I brought a change of clothes in here
because I'm covered in two...

11:34.152 --> 11:35.528
That's a little presumptuous.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.447
...two shows worth of sweat.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.865
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.492
I'm just gonna take a quick shower.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.427
I wanna be young again.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.179
Mmm. Do you?

12:01.262 --> 12:04.140
Yeah. I mean, I see you
every five years or so.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.102
-Wait, was it... It was five years?
-Five, yeah.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.106
-Don't you want to--
-When did you get these?

12:12.190 --> 12:13.816
-Hmm?
-Wait, when did you get these?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.276
Oh, for fuck's sake.

12:17.028 --> 12:18.446
Do you... do you need these?

12:18.529 --> 12:20.865
I always had 'em,
but I just, I wore them just for...

12:20.949 --> 12:22.158
-for distance.
-Yeah.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.952
And now I need 'em for everything.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.870
I can't read without.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.456
If I don't have them,
I can't see a thing.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.668
In the grocery store now,
I have to pull them out.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.961
-I can't, like...
-Oh.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.131
Hello.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.927
-What's going on, Bella?
-I don't know.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.304
-Look at this.
-What?

12:43.388 --> 12:44.681
-You're all gray.
-Yeah.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.516
You don't dye it or anything?

12:46.599 --> 12:48.101
-What's wrong with you?
-I stopped, I quit.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.561
I said I can't do it anymore. I can't...

12:50.645 --> 12:53.064
I was tired.

12:53.147 --> 12:54.774
-I think it's great.
-Yeah?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.484
Yeah. It's gonna be white.

12:56.567 --> 12:59.153
-It'll be like... It'll go really...
-It's gonna... Right?

12:59.237 --> 13:00.697
-Like silver.
-Yeah, I just--

13:00.822 --> 13:02.657
Like those beautiful women
with the silver...

13:02.740 --> 13:03.908
those, like, shock of silver.

13:04.826 --> 13:05.868
Hello.

13:05.952 --> 13:09.205
Can you tell that I like
that when you talk about...

13:09.288 --> 13:11.624
-Silver hair?
-Yeah, beautiful women with silver hair.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.959
Right?

13:13.042 --> 13:16.254
No, but they are... they're...
And your skin is all nice and clear still.

13:17.213 --> 13:20.466
-Come on, kiss.
-Look, are you trying to seduce me?

13:20.550 --> 13:22.427
Yes, you and your gray hair.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.640
Mmm.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.103
Watch out
for the creaking knees.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.563
Yeah? Hold on.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.024
Oh, my back.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.027
Skin the rabbit.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.320
Hello.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.920
This feels the same.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.341
God.

14:03.718 --> 14:08.264
I saw this guy once do this whole routine

14:08.347 --> 14:13.186
of getting stoned and looking for cereal
that he just made,

14:13.269 --> 14:15.313
and he just went on and on and on...

14:15.438 --> 14:18.066
and he would lose his cereal,
and he'd go...

14:18.149 --> 14:20.026
Go back to the fridge
and make some more cereal.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.694
And then he woke up the next morning...

14:21.778 --> 14:25.406
like, 12 bowls of cereal...
all over his apartment.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.408
Wait, I'm... I'm a little lost.
Wait, just...

14:28.743 --> 14:29.911
So he does this bit...

14:29.994 --> 14:33.373
-He's getting stoned and wants cereal...
-Yeah.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.708
-Oh. Stoner food.
-And then he makes cereal,

14:35.792 --> 14:37.377
and then he forgets
where the bowl is.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.921
-Yes.
-And then he forgets why he came in.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.742
Oh, fuck!

15:50.575 --> 15:52.535
Hey.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.870
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.164
I got <i>Jenga</i> or <i>Scrabble.</i>
What's your game?

15:56.247 --> 15:58.082
- <i>Jenga.</i> 100%.
- Yeah.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.459
Yeah, definitely. How's it going?

15:59.542 --> 16:01.419
Good. This is a nice place.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.837
Oh, yeah. Thank you.
Come on in.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.589
Wow. You did good.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.522
<i>Sophie,</i>
<i>I'm just calling you with an update.</i>

16:21.606 --> 16:25.776
<i>I spoke to the director again</i>
<i>and the executive at the studio,</i>

16:25.860 --> 16:30.740
<i>and it seems like everyone's really liking</i>
<i>the idea of you for the show.</i>

16:30.823 --> 16:33.284
<i>You know, I do believe they're gonna want</i>
<i>to bring you out to LA</i>

16:33.367 --> 16:36.579
<i>for a chemistry read where you would read</i>
<i>with the other actor</i>

16:36.662 --> 16:38.581
<i>who's already cast in the other role.</i>

16:38.664 --> 16:40.082
<i>It's looking very good.</i>

16:40.166 --> 16:42.793
<i>Give me a call back</i>
<i>and we'll get into more details.</i>

16:42.877 --> 16:44.587
<i>Thanks. Bye.</i>

16:44.670 --> 16:47.131
<i>If I get the part, then...</i>

16:47.215 --> 16:48.508
I...

16:49.509 --> 16:51.802
um, you know, I'll...

16:51.886 --> 16:55.348
I'll probably be moving to LA,
uh, 'cause it shoots in LA.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.850
Um, so, um...

16:59.101 --> 17:01.771
So, yeah, it would be pretty soon.

17:02.897 --> 17:06.859
Like, straight after the play finishes,
I'd probably be out there.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.572
So I just thought I should let you know
because, obviously, you know,

17:11.656 --> 17:14.700
- with you being, you know...
- I might not...

17:14.784 --> 17:17.078
You know,
it's going pretty quick, so, um...

17:17.161 --> 17:19.163
I might not be here when--

17:19.247 --> 17:22.750
<i>You might be gone, you might be</i>
<i>out of Chicago when I get home?</i>

17:22.833 --> 17:25.169
Well, listen...
I mean, nothing's like, you know,

17:25.253 --> 17:26.712
it's not 100% or anything but--

17:26.796 --> 17:28.714
<i>If you get the part, is what I'm saying.</i>

17:30.049 --> 17:31.926
Um...

17:32.009 --> 17:33.302
Well, yeah.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.888
Um, potentially, yeah, that...

17:36.973 --> 17:40.560
-That could--
<i>-This feels fast, don't you think?</i>

17:40.643 --> 17:43.020
Yes. I mean, listen,
I don't control the schedule.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.022
It's weird to me as well,
but, you know, it's like--

17:45.106 --> 17:46.524
<i>But is this what you want?</i>

17:47.525 --> 17:49.318
Well...

17:49.402 --> 17:50.903
It's, you know, I...

17:50.987 --> 17:54.949
It's a great opportunity for me,
right now, where I am.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.368
It's like, you know, it's a kind of...

17:57.451 --> 18:00.663
It's a step in a, you know,
different direction.

18:00.746 --> 18:04.542
I mean, it's much, you know,
bigger role and, like, you know,

18:04.625 --> 18:07.795
it would help me get
a bit more established and...

18:07.878 --> 18:09.046
um...

18:10.131 --> 18:12.425
So, yeah, it's a...

18:13.342 --> 18:17.096
You know, it's a...
it's a good career move.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.102
Um...

18:23.185 --> 18:24.312
<i>You know what I wish?</i>

18:25.313 --> 18:29.317
<i>I wish you cared as much about you and me</i>
<i>as you do that stuff.</i>

18:29.400 --> 18:32.111
That is not fair.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.031
<i>-That's what I wish.</i>
-That's isn't... That's not fair.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.992
<i>I don't think we should text anymore.</i>
<i>It's not good for me.</i>

18:38.075 --> 18:41.579
<i>Because when we text,</i>
<i>I think we're getting back together.</i>

18:41.662 --> 18:42.788
<i>When we talk...</i>

18:42.872 --> 18:46.042
<i>When you did this, I thought you were</i>
<i>saying you were rethinking it.</i>

18:47.168 --> 18:51.255
<i>If you're gone, then be gone</i>
<i>and just let me figure it out.</i>

18:51.339 --> 18:53.716
<i>But I can't keep having</i>
<i>you come back a little bit.</i>

18:53.799 --> 18:56.510
<i>And I know you say we're done and...</i>

18:57.219 --> 18:58.429
<i>it doesn't feel that way to me.</i>

18:58.512 --> 19:01.223
<i>It doesn't feel that way</i>
<i>when we talk, to me, so...</i>

19:01.307 --> 19:03.059
<i>I must be misreading it and I...</i>

19:03.142 --> 19:06.228
<i>I think we just gotta</i>
<i>stop talkin' for a while.</i>

19:06.312 --> 19:08.856
<i>So I hope you get it, I really do.</i>

19:08.939 --> 19:10.733
<i>I love ya.</i>

19:10.816 --> 19:15.112
<i>You're very good at everything you do.</i>
<i>You can do whatever you want.</i>

19:15.196 --> 19:18.199
<i>And I hope you have the life</i>
<i>you want out in California.</i>

19:21.327 --> 19:22.953
Okay.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.789
I get it. I understand.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.708
<i>All right. Good luck.</i>

19:29.543 --> 19:31.253
Thanks.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.766
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.476
-How are you?
-Good. How are you?

21:08.559 --> 21:10.853
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you, too.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.313
-Come on, it's been forever.
-Hey, where's Drew?

21:12.396 --> 21:13.856
Um...

21:13.939 --> 21:16.817
Oh, we, uh, actually, uh, broke up.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.444
- Um...
- Oh.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.613
-Oh, God.
-It's okay, it's... it's fine.

21:20.696 --> 21:23.699
But... but he's good.
He's really good. Yeah.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.826
-Sorry about that.
-That stinks. He was cool.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.953
Oh, yeah. Um...

21:28.037 --> 21:30.831
- Thanks. Um, how... how are you?
- We're good.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.792
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Things are good.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.585
What's going on?

21:34.668 --> 21:36.712
-Do you want to do the honors?
-Yeah.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.007
-You need practice. Go ahead.
-Mmm-hmm. Okay. We are...

21:41.550 --> 21:43.677
-pregnant. So...
-Pregnant. We're pregnant.

21:43.761 --> 21:45.221
- Oh, my God.
- That was a very pregnant pause.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.014
- Was that good? That wasn't good.
- We are pregnant.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.224
- Wow!
- Yeah, yeah.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.350
- Wow!
- Yeah, I know.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.102
I know, there's not, like,
much going on yet, but, like...

21:52.186 --> 21:53.771
-Oh, my goodness.
-I'm already, like, trying to see...

21:53.854 --> 21:55.064
You want to hear how...
how I did it?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.525
- No. Nobody wants to hear that. Ever.
- Congratulations.

21:57.608 --> 21:58.818
Thank you so much.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.486
What... How long?
When... when is it due?

22:00.569 --> 22:02.321
-We're just three months right now.
-Right.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.114
So we're allowed
to start telling people, so like...

22:04.198 --> 22:05.491
-Yeah.
-You're, like, one of the first people

22:05.574 --> 22:07.868
we've told, like, you know,
outside of our family.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.036
- Oh. That's amazing.
- I know.

22:09.119 --> 22:12.122
God, I feel so special to be
one of the first. Ah.

22:12.206 --> 22:14.750
I want to celebrate with you.
Um, what... what are you drink... Oh.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.502
- I'm not drinking anything.
- I don't know, it's...

22:16.585 --> 22:17.711
-it's got leaves in it.
-You drink for me.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.129
-It doesn't have leaves, it's mint.
-It does.

22:19.213 --> 22:20.673
-Stop touching it.
-Well, it's a leaf.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.174
-All right, I'll... I'll grab a drink...
-Yeah. Yeah.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.343
-...and we'll chat.
-Yeah. And come back. Okay. All right.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.347
- Wait!
- I'm not kidding.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.349
That was how I woke up
every day for school.

22:30.432 --> 22:31.934
- Every day?
- Yeah, they just don't have...

22:32.017 --> 22:34.436
Make 'em with that, like,
that old-school macho thing anymore.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.189
Like, I watched my dad take
a car engine apart

22:37.273 --> 22:39.275
piece by piece
and put it back together,

22:39.358 --> 22:40.442
and now my son... I don't...

22:40.526 --> 22:41.986
I don't even know
how to change the oil.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.612
I can't show him where.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.197
-But, like, do I need to?
-You know, I... Yeah.

22:45.281 --> 22:46.532
-Right.
-Sure. Computer games.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.242
Right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.452
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.413
How's it going?
That was a nice show tonight.

22:52.496 --> 22:54.081
Good, yeah, it was great, wasn't it?

22:54.164 --> 22:56.917
-Yeah. It was a good one. Yeah.
-Yeah. Great house.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.961
Is Andi here?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.421
No, no.

23:00.504 --> 23:01.922
Bummer, she, uh...
she couldn't make it.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.424
-Oh.
-Yeah, you know.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.510
Hey, you hear about, um,
Paige and Jeffrey's news?

23:06.594 --> 23:09.305
-Oh, my God. Totally. So good.
-Right. Amazing, right?

23:09.388 --> 23:12.641
Uh, amazing that they're
that old and having a kid.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.269
- They're not that old.
- I don't know. Good luck to them.

23:15.352 --> 23:16.562
Sheesh.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.522
Their knees, their backs.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.232
- Oh, my God.
- Kyle, please...

23:20.316 --> 23:21.483
It's a young person's game.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.111
Will you please come save me?
I just made the biggest ass of myself.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.321
-I can't... Hi.
-Oh, no. What happened?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.906
- How are you? I keep confusing...
- Yeah, sure, totally.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.205
- There you go.
- Okay.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.416
You got it.
It's gonna stay in there.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.043
There you go!

23:39.126 --> 23:42.463
Ah, it's only one.
That's only... It's only two.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.756
Oh, lot of momentum
still goin'.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.507
- Now, that's done...
- You can do it, keep goin'.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.092
- What are you playing?
- You got it. Keep goin'.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.595
We're playin', uh, skittles.
You want to play?

23:49.678 --> 23:53.891
Uh... sure.
Um, how do you... how do you play?

23:53.974 --> 23:56.518
It's easy. Check this out. Here.
Yeah, I'll take that, great. Thanks.

23:56.602 --> 23:57.686
- You got the string over there?
- Yep.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.855
Okay, cool. So, uh, what you do
is you want to take this.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.816
You gotta a top, right?
And your string.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.527
You wanna wrap the string
around the top like so.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.363
-All right.
-Messin' up, a little drunk.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.031
Hold on. Here we go.
Just like that. There.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.866
And here you just
continue wrapping it down.

24:10.949 --> 24:12.368
-Okay.
-So the top down.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.869
And you're gonna
load it in here, right?

24:13.952 --> 24:15.954
And then you just pull, and it goes.

24:16.038 --> 24:19.124
It might seem like luck.
It's not luck, it's skill.

24:19.208 --> 24:21.293
You gotta pull it just the right way.
All right?

24:21.377 --> 24:22.961
Okay, just to try and knock down
as many as--

24:23.045 --> 24:24.088
Yeah, knock down,
except for these two.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.381
- Yeah. Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.757
You got it.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.385
-Like that?
-Yeah. Just like that.
