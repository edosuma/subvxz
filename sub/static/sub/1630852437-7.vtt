00:05.208 --> 00:08.750
Mayor Mok Shaiz is on their payroll
and has flown off world,

00:08.833 --> 00:12.750
which leads us to believe
the storm is about to break.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.458
We need foot soldiers.

00:15.666 --> 00:17.791
THE MANDALORIAN:
I might be able to help with that.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.666
We're outnumbered by the Pyke Syndicate.
I need you to lead a garrison.

00:22.750 --> 00:26.041
Why should they risk their lives
for this Boba Fett?

00:26.541 --> 00:29.500
You tell your spice runners
Tatooine is closed for business.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.625
This planet's seen enough violence.

00:33.958 --> 00:36.875
<i>Tatooine belongs</i>
<i>to the Syndicate.</i>

00:37.541 --> 00:42.333
<i>As long as the spice keeps running,</i>
<i>everyone will be left alone.</i>

00:42.833 --> 00:46.375
BOBA FETT:<i> I will vanquish</i>
<i>these interlopers who threaten our planet.</i>

00:46.458 --> 00:48.625
<i>I will make the streets safe again.</i>

00:49.791 --> 00:53.708
All I ask in return
is that you remain neutral

00:53.791 --> 00:56.666
if the Pyke Syndicate approaches you
to betray me.

00:56.750 --> 00:59.583
This will be acceptable.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.083
I abide.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.791
We must prepare for war.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.166
Uh-uh, wait! You forgot your camtono.

02:01.166 --> 02:02.583
We are at war.

02:04.791 --> 02:05.958
It was inevitable.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.375
Even if we win,

02:10.291 --> 02:12.708
there might not be anything left
of this city.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.416
That was fast.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.875
Were you able to hire any foot soldiers?

02:24.916 --> 02:26.000
I think so.

02:26.583 --> 02:29.041
Cobb Vanth is raising a garrison for us.

02:29.625 --> 02:31.166
What price did you negotiate?

02:31.875 --> 02:32.875
Free.

02:32.958 --> 02:34.083
Free?

02:34.166 --> 02:37.083
He's been holding off
the spice trade single-handedly.

02:37.166 --> 02:39.041
I told him we could shut it down.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.166
That's not free.

02:40.875 --> 02:42.958
That's most of Jabba the Hutt's business.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.291
That's what the town wants.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.625
I agree to their terms.

02:47.708 --> 02:51.000
There's a lot of credits to be made
from that orange powder.

02:51.083 --> 02:53.333
In the long run,
it is better for us as well.

02:53.416 --> 02:56.958
Mos Espa can become a prosperous city
under our protection.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.500
Spice is killing our people.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.625
Let Marshal Vanth
and the people of Mos Pelgo...

03:02.708 --> 03:04.208
Freetown is its name now.

03:05.041 --> 03:07.916
Let the people of Freetown know
they have my word.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.958
You can tell Cobb Vanth himself

03:10.041 --> 03:12.291
when he arrives here
with the reinforcements.

03:12.375 --> 03:14.708
You are confident he will come?

03:15.416 --> 03:16.500
I am.

03:18.041 --> 03:20.333
Well, if he does not, we are doomed.

03:21.416 --> 03:24.208
Our skill is no match
for the Syndicate numbers.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.166
We must buy time until they arrive.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.666
We'll lockdown at the palace.

03:29.750 --> 03:30.916
It's a bad idea.

03:32.250 --> 03:33.333
Is that so?

03:33.791 --> 03:34.875
It is.

03:35.125 --> 03:37.875
And where do you propose
we wait for reinforcements?

03:38.833 --> 03:39.833
Here.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.083
Here?

03:42.166 --> 03:43.458
In these ruins?

03:45.291 --> 03:46.750
Nonsense.

03:46.833 --> 03:48.583
The palace offers greater protection.

03:48.666 --> 03:52.916
If you want to abandon Mos Espa
and hide in your fortress, go ahead.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.291
We're staying.

03:54.958 --> 03:57.875
The people who live here
need our protection.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.791
We'll stay.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.541
I have to respond.

04:42.041 --> 04:45.875
I have to respond in some way.
At the very least, I should...

04:46.416 --> 04:47.625
You returned so quickly.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.875
Was your venture successful?

04:49.958 --> 04:53.208
You won't have to worry about Freetown.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.916
Did you convince the Marshal
to remain neutral?

04:56.666 --> 04:58.500
Yes.

04:58.583 --> 05:01.333
Good.
I want this over as soon as possible.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.666
Does Fett have any other resources
to call upon?

05:05.166 --> 05:08.166
He used to live among
a Tusken Raider tribe in the desert.

05:08.250 --> 05:10.083
They no longer exist.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.333
Are you sure?

05:13.416 --> 05:16.166
Yes. We destroyed them ourselves.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Does Fett know that?

05:20.083 --> 05:21.625
He has no idea.

05:22.458 --> 05:25.125
He thinks they were killed
by Nikto speed bikers.

05:25.833 --> 05:28.958
We left evidence behind
to encourage such a conclusion.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.166
He meted out his revenge on them.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.583
In his mind, the matter is resolved.

05:36.125 --> 05:40.000
I didn't realize
the Pyke Syndicate was so ruthless.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.250
Pragmatic.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.833
They were charging us protection.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.708
We have to protect our margins.

05:47.833 --> 05:49.500
Indeed you do.

05:52.083 --> 05:53.833
So, when will this all be over?

05:54.791 --> 05:59.250
That all depends
on how much your two stomachs can bear.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.458
No more explosives.

06:03.125 --> 06:05.541
I didn't sign off
on bombing Garsa's Sanctuary.

06:06.458 --> 06:10.583
I agreed to surgical strikes,
not open warfare.

06:10.666 --> 06:13.791
With apologies,
it seems that line has been crossed.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.708
Well, I am still the mayor of Mos Espa,
and I will not see it destroyed.

06:18.791 --> 06:22.791
The Fett gotra is taking refuge
in the ruins of the Sanctuary.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.833
It will take extreme measures
to remove them.

06:27.541 --> 06:33.000
I think I have an idea
how to draw Boba Fett out.

07:00.625 --> 07:03.375
It's an X-wing.
What's an X-wing doing here?

07:10.458 --> 07:12.416
Stay in here. Lock it up, will you?

07:12.500 --> 07:14.000
Hide that. Get rid of that.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.916
Go. Go. Leave it over here, okay?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.916
Move it over there. Go! You heard me!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Quit it!

07:23.083 --> 07:24.208
Hello, officer!

07:24.750 --> 07:27.083
Hide it! Officer!

07:27.166 --> 07:30.083
I filed for my
New Republic certification seal

07:30.166 --> 07:31.791
just as you were landing.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.041
Quite a coincidence, if you ask me.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.833
Well, look who it is!

07:47.583 --> 07:48.625
Aw!

07:48.708 --> 07:52.375
Did they teach you
how to fly an X-wing already?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.041
I know an astromech flew the ship.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.458
The Mandalorian? He's not here.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.541
I don't know. He's on a job in Mos Espa.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.166
But just slow down. Give me a second.
You just got here.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.583
Let me say hello to my old pal.

08:18.791 --> 08:22.000
Well, hello, bright eyes. Come here.

08:24.791 --> 08:25.916
Grogu?

08:26.000 --> 08:28.458
Whoa! That's a terrible name.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.041
Sorry about that, pal.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.541
No way am I calling you that.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.833
What do you have here, huh?

08:34.916 --> 08:36.250
Something shiny.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.125
Well, look at you, all fancy.

08:38.208 --> 08:39.916
You must be starving.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.625
Bring him some dung worms.

08:45.541 --> 08:47.250
Oh, keep your dome on.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.541
I don't care how big of a rush you're in.

08:49.625 --> 08:50.916
Baby's got to eat.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.750
There you go.

09:00.833 --> 09:02.291
Okay.

09:12.208 --> 09:16.833
As we wait for the reinforcements
to arrive with Cobb Vanth from Freetown,

09:16.916 --> 09:20.458
our forces are quietly patrolling
the streets of the old city.

09:21.500 --> 09:24.500
The Pyke Syndicate
has not yet arrived in numbers,

09:24.583 --> 09:28.750
but the minute they do,
we will see them before they see us.

09:30.166 --> 09:33.625
The truce you negotiated
with the other families of Mos Espa

09:33.708 --> 09:35.708
will ensure that they will remain neutral

09:35.791 --> 09:40.083
and allow us to gain the upper hand
by surprising the arriving soldiers.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.041
<i>The Gamorrean guards</i>
<i>are posted in the Klatooinian territory</i>

09:58.125 --> 09:59.250
<i>at the starport</i>

09:59.333 --> 10:02.833
<i>and will alert us if any</i>
<i>of the Pyke Syndicate forces arrive.</i>

10:06.416 --> 10:08.916
<i>Krrsantan is in Trandoshan territory,</i>

10:09.000 --> 10:12.750
<i>keeping tabs on the streets</i>
<i>of the municipality in front of City Hall.</i>

10:28.750 --> 10:30.916
<i>Drash and Skad are with the other Mods</i>

10:31.000 --> 10:34.583
keeping an eye on the Worker's District
and the Aqualish Quarter.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.875
As you can see,
all our flanks are covered.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.416
Nobody is sneaking up on us.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.541
When the people of Freetown arrive,

10:42.625 --> 10:45.541
we will have the forces required
to pivot our strength

10:45.625 --> 10:49.541
to whatever region
the Pykes choose to attack from.

10:49.625 --> 10:50.750
For now?

10:50.833 --> 10:52.208
We wait.

10:56.083 --> 10:59.416
Lord Fett?
There is someone here to see you.

11:00.541 --> 11:03.041
I thought you said
nobody could sneak up on us.

11:26.750 --> 11:29.500
I thought I smelled something.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.875
If you're looking for a job, you're late.

11:36.541 --> 11:38.583
I've already got a job.

11:39.541 --> 11:44.125
I'm here to negotiate
on behalf of the Pyke Syndicate.

11:45.250 --> 11:49.708
I don't negotiate
with gutless murderers.

11:50.875 --> 11:55.708
If that's not the Quacta
calling the Stifling slimy.

11:55.791 --> 11:56.875
Clear out.

11:57.583 --> 12:00.208
And tell your bosses
we know they're outnumbered.

12:01.708 --> 12:07.291
I wouldn't be counting on the people
of Freetown to be coming anytime soon.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.750
I paid Marshal Vanth a visit.

12:14.375 --> 12:17.625
You should've never left him
without his armor.

12:24.500 --> 12:27.083
Before you get any ideas,

12:27.166 --> 12:29.541
I've got back shooters too.

12:39.208 --> 12:42.500
Let the spice move through Mos Espa,

12:42.583 --> 12:45.291
and all this can be avoided.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.250
No.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.208
What do you propose then?

12:57.125 --> 13:00.791
I will only negotiate
with the head of the Pyke Syndicate.

13:01.541 --> 13:04.875
You mean the one that massacred
your Tusken family

13:04.958 --> 13:07.666
and blamed it on a speed bike gang?

13:20.500 --> 13:22.166
You know it's true.

13:24.666 --> 13:25.916
Boba.

13:28.291 --> 13:32.791
Let's do this right here, right now.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.958
Not now.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.625
You pick when.

13:42.708 --> 13:46.125
He killed Vanth.
The reinforcements aren't coming.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.916
We fight
on our terms, not theirs.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.250
-I can take him.
-You're emotional.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.208
I can take him.

13:55.291 --> 13:57.666
We need to adjust.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.500
You'll have your moment.

14:12.750 --> 14:17.375
Tell your client
negotiations are terminated.

14:20.541 --> 14:23.666
You're going soft in your old age.

14:24.625 --> 14:26.125
We all do.

14:41.291 --> 14:44.833
That was
an impressive display of restraint.

14:45.541 --> 14:47.250
Exemplary stratagem.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.125
If I may be so bold
as to offer additional counsel...

14:50.208 --> 14:52.333
I wonder how much
he would pay for the Twi'lek.

14:52.416 --> 14:55.083
Understood. Many pardons.
I should never have interjected.

14:55.166 --> 14:57.083
DRASH:<i> Come in, boss. Come in.</i>

14:57.958 --> 14:59.666
<i>Something feels strange over here.</i>

14:59.750 --> 15:01.000
Have the Pykes arrived?

15:01.083 --> 15:03.083
DRASH:<i> Not yet, but something feels off.</i>

15:16.791 --> 15:18.291
The locals are attacking.

15:19.041 --> 15:20.291
I thought we had a treaty.

15:20.375 --> 15:21.666
So did I.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.416
- They laid a trap!

15:28.166 --> 15:30.208
Santo! Santo, come in!

16:31.625 --> 16:33.541
It's a coordinated attack.

16:33.625 --> 16:34.958
We'll have to gather our people.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.083
There's no way
to overcome their advantage.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.833
We need to take out command and control.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.750
Does the Pyke Syndicate
still operate out of Mos Eisley?

16:41.833 --> 16:44.250
Oh, it's difficult
to say for certain that...

16:45.416 --> 16:46.500
Mos Eisley?

16:46.583 --> 16:48.791
Yes, now that I think of it,
indeed they do.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.416
More specifically,
the Desert Survey Office.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.583
Can you do that?
Can you get there in time?

16:53.666 --> 16:54.833
Worth a shot.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.958
- How many are there?
- I can't tell. At least a dozen.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.000
- We can't retreat. We're pinned down.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.333
<i>Stay put.</i>

17:37.416 --> 17:38.833
- What?
FENNEC SHAND: <i>Don't move.</i>

17:39.500 --> 17:41.166
But they'll swamp our position.

17:41.250 --> 17:42.791
<i>Keep your heads down.</i>

18:04.791 --> 18:06.916
Get to the Sanctuary.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
Hey.

18:09.916 --> 18:10.916
Thank you.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.125
Manners.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.666
I like it.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.125
You're welcome.

18:58.625 --> 18:59.833
They're here.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.083
It was just a matter of time.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.666
Is Cad Bane with them?

19:09.000 --> 19:10.583
Don't see him.

19:10.666 --> 19:12.208
Any news on the others?

19:13.250 --> 19:15.583
Would be a miracle
if any survived.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.208
All three gotras of Mos Espa turned on us.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.375
It was the smart move.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.416
It was.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.833
I suppose you'll be heading out.

19:30.666 --> 19:31.750
I'm not.

19:32.583 --> 19:33.750
You should.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.250
It's against the Creed.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.291
I gave you my word.

19:40.041 --> 19:41.875
I'm with you until we both fall.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.625
You really buy
into that bantha fodder?

19:45.708 --> 19:47.291
I do.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.208
Good.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.375
The way I see it,
we have two choices.

19:58.041 --> 20:02.541
We wait until they get into position
and launch a siege on their terms.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.625
Or?

20:04.708 --> 20:07.416
We rush out there,
catch them unaware.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.750
Then we can escape
to your ship at the palace.

20:10.416 --> 20:12.583
I can't abandon Mos Espa.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.791
These people are counting on me.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.416
Okay, then.

20:18.666 --> 20:20.583
We'll both die in the name of honor.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.500
You sure you wanna stay?

20:27.583 --> 20:28.916
This is the way.

20:32.208 --> 20:34.833
If I may offer an alternative?

20:38.416 --> 20:39.708
Shall I continue?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.083
I'll continue.

20:43.166 --> 20:45.416
You may not know this about me,

20:45.500 --> 20:46.791
in fact, how could you,

20:46.875 --> 20:50.208
except perhaps
what vestiges remain of my accent, but...

20:50.708 --> 20:52.541
I was educated on Coruscant.

20:52.625 --> 20:55.375
- Not that that makes me better in any way.
- Get to it.

20:55.458 --> 20:56.833
Yeah, uh...

20:57.666 --> 21:02.458
I attended finishing academy.
My parents were not wealthy by any means.

21:04.125 --> 21:08.625
I specialized
in Civic Council Negotiations.

21:09.250 --> 21:15.041
Now, if you would feel confident
empowering me to negotiate on your behalf,

21:15.125 --> 21:19.541
I'm fairly certain
we would be granted passage off world

21:19.625 --> 21:26.166
with, at worst, some theatrical,
symbolic, groveling gestures

21:26.250 --> 21:27.833
and an exchange of funds.

21:31.083 --> 21:33.833
Very well. Give me your tablet.

21:34.333 --> 21:37.333
I will write out my statement
and what I am willing to pay.

21:40.583 --> 21:42.125
I shall go as your emissary.

21:42.208 --> 21:44.333
I have no compunction whatsoever

21:44.416 --> 21:47.208
genuflecting or even groveling
if needs be,

21:47.291 --> 21:52.458
which would save you from any potential
bruising of ego, so to speak.

21:52.541 --> 21:54.416
Now go before I change my mind.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.791
Yes. Excellent.

21:57.875 --> 22:00.291
Salutations! Salutations!

22:00.375 --> 22:01.958
I am unarmed

22:02.500 --> 22:06.791
but for this tablet
bearing the terms of surrender.

22:07.750 --> 22:10.625
I wish to present to whomever spokesperson

22:10.708 --> 22:12.958
is empowered to deliberate
an acceptable outcome

22:13.041 --> 22:15.250
in the eyes of the Oba Diah high council.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.250
Read it to me, tail-head.

22:17.333 --> 22:21.541
Oh,
because of the enchanting sobriquet,

22:21.625 --> 22:24.083
and one of which I never tire.

22:24.166 --> 22:25.416
Yes.

22:25.500 --> 22:29.833
Someday I hope to see
the fabled Obsidian Cliffs of Oba Diah

22:29.916 --> 22:31.125
with my own eyes.

22:31.208 --> 22:32.208
Read it.

22:32.291 --> 22:35.208
Agreed.
Let us dispense with the pleasantries.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.708
"I, Boba Fett,

22:40.541 --> 22:42.750
"speaking as Daimyo
of the Tatooine territories

22:42.833 --> 22:45.375
"formerly held by Jabba the Hutt,

22:45.458 --> 22:47.666
"do present the following offer."

22:55.875 --> 22:58.333
Perhaps we should discuss
what you'd be willing to...

22:58.416 --> 22:59.541
Read it.

23:01.666 --> 23:02.833
"...following offer.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.041
"Nothing."

23:07.916 --> 23:10.416
Uh... "You will leave this planet

23:11.875 --> 23:13.958
"and your spice trade.

23:14.916 --> 23:17.333
"If you refuse these terms...

23:18.833 --> 23:21.041
"...the arid sands of Tatooine

23:21.125 --> 23:24.541
"will once again flourish
with flowered fields

23:24.625 --> 23:27.541
"fertilized with the bodies of your dead."

23:34.375 --> 23:35.958
His words.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.416
They just keep coming.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.916
The people of Freetown.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.250
Help while you got cover!

25:38.333 --> 25:40.416
Come on! Move! Move! Move!

25:46.166 --> 25:47.666
FREETOWN MAN 1:
Let's go! Move! Go! Go! Go!

25:51.916 --> 25:54.083
-I got 'em!
-Right there!

25:54.166 --> 25:55.250
Take cover!

26:04.833 --> 26:07.041
THE MANDALORIAN:
I'm sorry about the Marshal.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.458
They gunned him down in cold blood.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.750
THE MANDALORIAN:
You didn't have to come here.

26:13.833 --> 26:14.833
Yes, we did.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.291
This planet deserves better.

26:45.041 --> 26:46.750
Come on! Move, move, move!

26:47.458 --> 26:48.750
Let's go!

26:50.708 --> 26:51.833
You all right?

26:51.916 --> 26:53.416
Got pretty hairy back there.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.208
Where'd all these sand scurriers
come from?

26:55.291 --> 26:57.500
We're here to save the tails
of some city rats.

26:58.333 --> 26:59.958
Save it for the Pykes.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.000
Cover me!

27:53.416 --> 27:55.250
Welcome back, Santo.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.375
I have to confess I thought you were gone.

27:58.291 --> 28:01.416
I owe you a nice long soak
in the bacta tank when this is done.

28:01.500 --> 28:02.833
They're falling back!

28:11.583 --> 28:13.541
- Freetown!
- Yeah!

28:21.416 --> 28:23.333
I wouldn't celebrate yet.

28:23.416 --> 28:24.583
We got problems.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.416
We got real problems.

29:39.458 --> 29:41.416
Run! We'll distract them.

30:36.875 --> 30:38.416
I can't get through.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.916
These two
will destroy the whole city!

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
THE MANDALORIAN:
Our energy weapons can't get through,

30:45.083 --> 30:46.958
and our kinetic weapons
have too much velocity.

30:47.041 --> 30:48.125
Move!

30:49.375 --> 30:50.666
Can you protect the others?

30:50.750 --> 30:52.750
I can distract them
for a spell. Why?

30:52.833 --> 30:54.291
-Watch out!

30:55.583 --> 30:56.833
We need reinforcements.

30:56.916 --> 30:59.000
From where?
You've run out of friends.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.208
Protect the others.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.166
Right. Come on.

32:13.666 --> 32:14.666
PYKE:<i> Sleemo!</i>

32:23.833 --> 32:25.250
All right, come on.

32:25.333 --> 32:26.541
We got you.

32:40.291 --> 32:42.458
Mando! Ha! We found you!

32:42.541 --> 32:44.041
I got a surprise for you.

32:44.125 --> 32:45.750
- Turn around!
- What?

32:45.833 --> 32:48.125
- Turn around!
- Can't hear you!

32:51.875 --> 32:53.958
Turn around!

33:08.000 --> 33:09.708
Can this thing go any faster?

33:09.791 --> 33:11.916
Go faster, you bucket of bolts!

33:13.750 --> 33:14.791
Whoo!

33:21.958 --> 33:23.125
Take cover!

33:29.916 --> 33:32.833
We have to stop retreating!
We need to dig in here!

33:36.208 --> 33:37.416
Fall back!

33:37.916 --> 33:39.125
We're getting swamped.

33:39.708 --> 33:40.916
She says we should stay.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.916
Nonsense! We'll get vaporized.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.500
I grew up a womp hop from here,

33:44.583 --> 33:47.875
and if we fall back any further,
we'll be cornered with no cover.

33:48.500 --> 33:49.833
So, we're gonna die here?

33:49.916 --> 33:51.166
No.

33:51.250 --> 33:52.625
We fight.

34:05.208 --> 34:08.458
Skad, hold the line with the Weequay.
I'll head up there and snipe down.

34:08.541 --> 34:09.583
Let me see that thing.

34:10.541 --> 34:12.041
With that?

34:12.916 --> 34:14.666
Taanti, we need a cycler.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.125
Good luck.

34:22.833 --> 34:23.833
Let's go.

34:23.916 --> 34:25.000
Cover us.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.291
Hey, Mando!

34:31.375 --> 34:32.708
Look who's here.

34:34.250 --> 34:36.750
What?

34:36.833 --> 34:38.250
Hey, what are you doing here?

34:39.666 --> 34:40.666
Oh!

34:41.250 --> 34:42.458
Okay, little guy.

34:43.208 --> 34:44.791
I'm happy to see you too.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.458
I didn't know when I'd see you again.

34:49.083 --> 34:50.416
It's okay.

34:50.500 --> 34:53.041
Yeah. I missed you too, buddy.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.583
But, uh...

34:57.000 --> 34:59.041
we're in a bit of a bind here right now.

35:00.458 --> 35:02.666
You be careful. You keep your head down.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.583
You stay hidden until the fight's over.

35:05.625 --> 35:06.875
Hey, that's the shirt.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.458
You got the shirt.

35:10.791 --> 35:12.250
Save your tender moment.

35:12.333 --> 35:14.583
We've got a Scorpenek droid chasing us.

35:20.125 --> 35:21.583
What is he doing here?

35:21.666 --> 35:24.041
The Force works in mysterious ways.

37:00.125 --> 37:01.583
Don't move.

37:01.666 --> 37:02.750
Let me handle this.

38:51.541 --> 38:52.625
Do it.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.375
All right, they've made it to the roof.

39:27.458 --> 39:28.750
We make our stand.

39:29.291 --> 39:30.333
Take it to 'em!

39:36.583 --> 39:38.083
Can you pick off some of the fighters?

39:38.166 --> 39:39.958
I'm used to desert hunting.

39:40.041 --> 39:41.541
Can't miss at this range.

39:41.625 --> 39:42.958
I'll distract the droid.

41:53.458 --> 41:56.833
Keep 'em on their heels.
They're on the run.

41:56.916 --> 41:58.666
Come on, let's get the Pykes.

42:08.125 --> 42:09.583
I am not a threat.

42:09.666 --> 42:12.958
Nice, head-tails.
Come on. Get behind me, pretty face.

42:13.041 --> 42:14.958
Peli's got you covered.

42:15.041 --> 42:18.333
- Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- We don't have time for that.

43:42.333 --> 43:46.083
Clear out
and take your hoodlum gang with you.

43:47.500 --> 43:50.250
I've known you a long time, Boba.

43:51.875 --> 43:54.083
One thing I can't figure.

43:58.458 --> 43:59.833
What's your angle?

44:01.500 --> 44:02.958
This is my city.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.708
These are my people.

44:05.625 --> 44:07.416
I will not abandon them.

44:08.083 --> 44:10.125
Like the Tuskens.

44:12.208 --> 44:14.125
Don't toy with me.

44:14.208 --> 44:16.333
I'm not a little boy any longer,

44:16.833 --> 44:18.583
and you are an old man.

44:19.333 --> 44:21.583
I'm still faster than you.

44:23.166 --> 44:24.375
That may be,

44:25.291 --> 44:26.583
but I have armor.

44:28.541 --> 44:30.208
Let's find out.

44:44.666 --> 44:49.416
Now's about the time
you jet off to your bacta tank.

44:49.500 --> 44:50.958
This is my city!

44:57.666 --> 44:59.541
You gave it a shot.

44:59.625 --> 45:01.875
You tried to go straight.

45:01.958 --> 45:06.791
But you've got your father's blood
pumping through your veins.

45:06.875 --> 45:08.625
You're a killer.

45:11.250 --> 45:14.500
This isn't the first time
I beat you out on a job.

45:18.958 --> 45:20.583
There's no shame in it.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.833
Consider this my final lesson.

45:34.541 --> 45:36.791
Look out for yourself.

45:38.208 --> 45:42.291
Anything else is weakness.

45:57.500 --> 46:00.291
I knew you were a killer.

46:33.958 --> 46:35.708
- Let's go! Go. Go. Go.
- This way! This way!

46:37.833 --> 46:39.583
The rancor's on the loose!

47:01.583 --> 47:02.625
You're scaring it!

47:02.708 --> 47:05.250
Put your blasters down! Stop shooting!

47:23.833 --> 47:26.458
- Keep him safe.
- Well, who's gonna keep me safe?

47:28.333 --> 47:29.416
Here.

47:29.958 --> 47:30.958
Hang on to this.

47:32.291 --> 47:33.750
It's gonna be okay.

47:55.708 --> 47:58.125
Don't worry, kid. Your old man's crafty.

48:00.625 --> 48:02.333
Ooh, spoke too soon.

48:35.291 --> 48:36.708
Don't worry, kid, I...

48:36.791 --> 48:38.250
Where'd you go, kid?

50:26.458 --> 50:28.458
I'm guessing
there's not gonna be a barbecue.

50:29.083 --> 50:30.125
Well done, everybody.

50:30.208 --> 50:32.166
- Thank you so much.
- That's it. It's over.

50:52.083 --> 50:55.291
The Syndicate forces
have pulled back from Mos Espa

50:55.375 --> 50:58.416
and should be arriving here
in Mos Eisley shortly

50:58.500 --> 51:00.125
so that we may disembark.

51:01.166 --> 51:02.958
You can't just cut and run.

51:03.041 --> 51:04.916
We lost soldiers too.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.583
We had a deal.

51:07.541 --> 51:12.541
Our deal was that Tatooine was going to be
a hospitable place to do business.

51:12.625 --> 51:13.833
It is.

51:13.916 --> 51:17.375
Half of my men were either shot
or eaten by a rancor.

51:17.458 --> 51:19.375
Is that what you call hospitable?

51:22.041 --> 51:23.125
Guards!

52:56.250 --> 52:57.541
Ah, Lord Boba.

52:58.250 --> 53:00.625
Why does it have to be
the right arm?

53:01.583 --> 53:03.916
You should take a nice soak
in the bacta tank.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.291
It's being used.

53:07.041 --> 53:08.250
Right here.

53:08.333 --> 53:09.541
Thank you.

53:09.625 --> 53:11.375
Why must everyone bow at me?

53:11.875 --> 53:13.291
It's better than shooting.

53:14.291 --> 53:16.375
Are those my only two choices?

53:16.458 --> 53:17.916
When you run the town, it is.

53:19.250 --> 53:20.291
Meiloorun?

53:20.375 --> 53:21.541
Thank you.

53:21.625 --> 53:22.666
Thank you.

53:25.208 --> 53:26.833
We are not suited for this.

53:29.916 --> 53:32.333
If not us, then who?

53:47.041 --> 53:49.166
So, the Wookiee gets a melon and we don't?

53:49.250 --> 53:50.708
