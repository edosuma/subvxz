WEBVTT

00:03.250 --> 00:06.375
Dude, I thought we were going
to the Halloween party at school.

00:06.458 --> 00:09.792
-Why aren't you in a costume?
-I am.

00:09.875 --> 00:11.417
Why else would I be dressed like this?

00:11.500 --> 00:14.417
Because it's much nicer
than what you usually wear?

00:16.125 --> 00:17.709
What are you supposed to be?

00:17.792 --> 00:19.542
I'm a party animal.

00:19.625 --> 00:21.542
Party. Animal.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.458
Yeah, no one's gonna get that.

00:27.125 --> 00:29.417
Unlike my costume.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.959
You're not wearing a costume.

00:31.041 --> 00:34.458
Yes, I am.
I'm a nerd.

00:34.542 --> 00:35.959
See?

00:36.041 --> 00:37.625
I'm holding a book.

00:37.709 --> 00:39.583
Like a nerd. Pfft.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.667
That's insane.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.208
No one's even gonna notice
you're wearing a costume at all.

00:45.291 --> 00:48.792
Kaz, I like your nerd costume.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.333
Oliver,
I've no idea what you are.

00:56.792 --> 00:59.417
So you must love having
your powers back.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.000
If you're looking
for a way to thank me,

01:01.083 --> 01:02.375
you could...

01:04.000 --> 01:06.250
I was going to kiss you,
but okay.

01:09.792 --> 01:12.583
Hey, Skylar,
what's up with your hair?

01:12.667 --> 01:15.625
Your pink streak,
it turned white.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.083
Uh...

01:17.166 --> 01:19.917
that's just part of
my Halloween costume.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.083
I'm Skylar Storm
at 80 years old.

01:22.166 --> 01:23.750
(imitating old lady)
There is a storm coming.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.834
(coughs)

01:26.917 --> 01:28.583
Skylar Storm.

01:30.750 --> 01:33.375
Well, good,
because everyone knows

01:33.458 --> 01:35.625
that a telltale sign
of a superhero turning evil

01:35.709 --> 01:37.917
is when one of their distinctive
features turns white.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.667
I am not evil, I am just old.

01:40.750 --> 01:42.792
(imitating old lady)
Can one of you whipper-snappers

01:42.875 --> 01:45.250
teach me how to attach
a photo to an email?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.125
Email?

01:47.208 --> 01:49.125
Wow, you are old.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.667
Horace, what happened?

01:52.750 --> 01:55.083
Oh, I spilled some
prune juice on my pants.

01:57.792 --> 02:00.166
Yeah, I meant
the dying superhero.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.834
Oh.

02:01.917 --> 02:04.500
Snowstorm was attacked by
her nemesis, the Incinerator.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.000
She's in stable condition,

02:06.083 --> 02:07.792
but there's a risk
the Incinerator's toxin

02:07.875 --> 02:09.583
will spread
and burn her up inside.

02:09.667 --> 02:10.542
I don't get it.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.792
Why isn't Snowstorm's freezing
power counteracting the heat?

02:13.875 --> 02:15.792
Because the Annihilator
stole her powers.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.750
I saw her canister on his shelf,
next to Skylar's.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.041
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

02:20.125 --> 02:21.667
Kaz and I can go to
the Annihilator's lair

02:21.750 --> 02:23.375
and get back Snowstorm's powers,

02:23.458 --> 02:25.667
and while we're there, we can
grab all the other powers

02:25.750 --> 02:27.875
and restore them to all
the superheroes who lost them?

02:27.959 --> 02:28.875
No.

02:28.959 --> 02:30.291
I was actually thinking

02:30.417 --> 02:32.291
how much I love
Kaz's nerd costume.

02:33.667 --> 02:35.250
Oliver,
I have no idea what you are.

I'm just trying to hide

03:32.250 --> 03:34.000
There, now it doesn't show.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.625
I heard Oliver and Kaz say
there's a Halloween party

03:40.709 --> 03:43.250
tonight at the Normo school.
Can I go?

03:43.333 --> 03:44.917
I don't want you
in the Normo world.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.125
It's too dangerous.

03:46.208 --> 03:47.709
Too dangerous?

03:47.792 --> 03:49.709
This place gets attacked
like once a week.

03:51.375 --> 03:53.333
Besides, going to the party
will give me a chance

03:53.417 --> 03:55.709
to explore my roots,
since I'm half-Normo.

03:55.792 --> 03:58.125
Half-Normo?
Who told you that?

03:58.208 --> 04:00.250
You did.

04:00.333 --> 04:04.542
Oh, that's right.
You are half-Normo.

04:04.625 --> 04:08.083
That's part of your history
I'd like to forget, so I did.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.792
Anyway, you can't
go to the party

04:11.875 --> 04:14.750
because we're celebrating
Halloween

04:14.834 --> 04:16.250
right here at Mighty Med.

04:16.333 --> 04:18.458
I'll show you.
Say trick-or-treat.

04:18.542 --> 04:19.542
Trick-or-treat.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.000
Trick!

04:24.083 --> 04:25.208
There!

04:26.417 --> 04:28.709
Wasn't that fun?

04:28.792 --> 04:30.041
I love Halloween!

04:38.875 --> 04:42.208
Oh, hey, Phillip,
can I talk to you for a second?

04:42.291 --> 04:43.250
No.

04:43.333 --> 04:45.208
Thanks.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.625
I don't know what to do.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.583
I want to go to this
Halloween party tonight

04:48.667 --> 04:51.417
at the Normo school,
but my Uncle Horace won't let me.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.417
I'm thinking about
sneaking out and going anyway.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.792
What do you think?

04:55.875 --> 04:57.500
I think you should leave me alone.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.333
That's what everybody says.

05:01.417 --> 05:02.417
Psst.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.125
Hey, kid, come here.

05:05.792 --> 05:08.083
You should definitely go to
that Normo Halloween party.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.458
Really?

05:09.542 --> 05:11.333
Yeah, and we'll go with you.

05:11.417 --> 05:12.709
Halloween's
the only day of the year

05:12.792 --> 05:16.625
we can walk among Normos
and not draw attention.

05:16.709 --> 05:18.125
Agh!

05:18.208 --> 05:20.375
Dude, kind of hard
not to draw attention

05:20.458 --> 05:21.834
with a spotlight on you.

05:24.208 --> 05:26.542
You can all come,
but I don't want my Uncle Horace

05:26.625 --> 05:27.667
to know I'm gone.

05:29.208 --> 05:31.208
Phillip, put this on
and pretend to be me.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.000
Here.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.709
Yeah, good start being me.

05:39.792 --> 05:41.375
That's totally something
I would do.

05:48.792 --> 05:50.125
Hey, Skylar,
we need your help.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.000
Kaz and I are going
to the Annihilator's lair

05:52.083 --> 05:53.458
to bring back
all the stolen powers

05:53.542 --> 05:56.834
-and restore them to all the superheroes.
-You're doing what?

05:56.917 --> 06:00.083
I mean, you're doing wha-at?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.625
Yeah, anyway,
Oliver's too weak

06:05.709 --> 06:08.625
to carry the powers
and I'm too lazy.

06:09.750 --> 06:11.083
So can you come
with us and help?

06:11.166 --> 06:12.667
Dang it!

06:12.750 --> 06:14.125
I'd love to,

06:14.208 --> 06:16.208
but Horace won't let me
leave Mighty Med

06:16.291 --> 06:18.166
until he runs
some tests on me.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.583
What's that, Horace?

06:19.667 --> 06:21.166
Okay, on my way.

06:21.250 --> 06:23.417
That was my super-hearing test.
Aced it.

06:27.709 --> 06:29.583
Hey, why don't we just
ask Tecton to help?

06:29.667 --> 06:30.959
He's a superhero.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.250
He has more important things to do
than to be our errand boy.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.166
Think outside the box.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.667
He's a superhero.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.500
Superheroes help people.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.000
We're people.
We need help.

06:40.083 --> 06:41.959
So he'll help us.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.750
That's not how it works.

06:43.834 --> 06:45.875
Tecton, will you help us
with an errand?

06:45.959 --> 06:47.750
Sure.
I'm a superhero.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.709
I help people.
You're people.

06:49.792 --> 06:51.291
You need help.
So I'll help you.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.917
Finally, I get to see
Normo teenagers

07:01.000 --> 07:02.750
in their natural habitat.

07:02.834 --> 07:04.792
And what's more natural
than pretending

07:04.875 --> 07:07.709
to be the undead
or an ice cream cone?

07:10.250 --> 07:11.834
Alan?

07:11.917 --> 07:14.792
I almost didn't recognize
you in that crazy costume.

07:14.875 --> 07:17.041
A sweater vest
with sleeves.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.500
Insane.

07:19.583 --> 07:20.667
What are you supposed to be?

07:20.750 --> 07:24.083
The floor
of a movie theater.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.792
Normo log, entry one:

07:29.875 --> 07:31.792
you can find free
snacks on the floor

07:31.875 --> 07:33.458
of a Normo movie theater.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.208
Okay, I'm gonna go do
some more research.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.041
Remember,
we can't let anybody know

07:41.125 --> 07:43.208
that superheroes
actually exist,

07:43.291 --> 07:44.834
so do not use
your powers here.

07:44.917 --> 07:46.834
He's talking to you,
Incognito.

08:00.208 --> 08:02.041
Ah! Jeez!

08:02.125 --> 08:05.709
Don't you knock before you
enter from a space portal?

08:05.792 --> 08:06.750
Sorry.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.750
Listen, I have bad news.

08:08.834 --> 08:11.125
Oliver and Kaz are going to
return the powers in your lair

08:11.208 --> 08:12.875
to the superheroes
that you stole them from.

08:12.959 --> 08:15.583
Hmm. Maybe we can use
this to our advantage.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.291
Go to my lair and sabotage

08:17.375 --> 08:19.125
the powers
before the boys get there.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.542
Brilliant.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.583
Then when they restore
the powers,

08:22.667 --> 08:24.417
they'll create an army
of evil superheroes.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.333
(door closing)

08:25.375 --> 08:26.917
Wait. Someone's coming.

08:34.542 --> 08:36.208
I love doing that.

08:37.583 --> 08:39.583
Make sure the boys
are delayed.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.792
Will do.
See you later.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.625
You're still there,
aren't you?

08:47.166 --> 08:49.667
Sorry, I really love doing that.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.667
Tecton said
he'd meet us at the lair.

08:54.750 --> 08:55.875
He's helping a friend move.

08:55.959 --> 08:57.750
That guy really needs
to learn to say no.

08:59.250 --> 09:00.959
Good,
you guys haven't left yet.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.458
We were about to
when we realized that

09:02.542 --> 09:04.083
we need one
of Experion's eyeballs

09:04.166 --> 09:05.750
to get past the Annihilator's
retina scanner.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.625
So we went all the way down
to Mighty Max

09:07.709 --> 09:09.917
and then Experion remembered
that the Annihilator

09:10.000 --> 09:13.750
keeps an extra eyeball
hidden under the welcome mat.

09:13.834 --> 09:16.667
Which seems like an unsanitary
place to keep an eyeball,

09:16.750 --> 09:18.542
but then again,
the guy does live in a sewer.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.458
(alarm buzzing)

09:20.542 --> 09:23.333
Boys, Snowstorm has taken
a sudden turn for the worse.

09:23.417 --> 09:26.250
We have to restore her powers
right away or she'll die.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.834
Also if you see Alan,

09:27.917 --> 09:29.333
tell him I made him
this for Halloween.

09:30.709 --> 09:32.750
That's the worst carved
pumpkin ever.

09:32.834 --> 09:34.709
Are you kidding?

09:34.792 --> 09:37.750
It's a perfectly
accurate portrait.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.834
Doctor O'Lantern,
let's go tend to Snowstorm.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.834
Kaz, we have to get
to the lair fast.

09:47.917 --> 09:51.458
Hey, maybe I can open up
a space portal for you guys.

09:51.542 --> 09:53.208
You'll get there in,
like, a second.

09:53.291 --> 09:57.709
Ooh, I've always wanted to
travel through a space portal.

09:57.792 --> 09:59.667
Wait, is it cold?

09:59.750 --> 10:01.667
Yeah, should
we wear windbreakers?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.417
You'll be fine.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.959
But don't tell Horace
I used my powers,

10:07.041 --> 10:08.583
because he'll get mad

10:08.667 --> 10:10.375
and I hear he's throwing
eggs at people.

10:11.709 --> 10:13.041
Trick!

10:25.750 --> 10:26.792
Where are we?

10:26.875 --> 10:28.500
Skylar's space portal

10:28.583 --> 10:30.375
accidentally
stranded us in space...

10:30.458 --> 10:31.709
space...

10:31.792 --> 10:33.250
space.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.542
Horace was right.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.417
Her powers
are still messed up.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.750
But luckily we're surrounded
by some kind of bubble.

10:39.834 --> 10:41.750
Yeah,
but it's freezing in here.

10:41.834 --> 10:44.667
And you made fun of me
for having a windbreaker.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.542
All right, let's just
go back through the portal.

10:52.583 --> 10:53.625
The portal's gone!

10:53.709 --> 10:55.083
What if we're stuck in here?

10:55.166 --> 10:56.959
How much oxygen do we have?

10:57.041 --> 10:58.125
Don't worry.

10:58.208 --> 10:59.583
We're not going to
run out of oxygen.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.709
How do you know?

11:00.792 --> 11:03.000
Because we're going to be
killed by that meteor first!

11:06.500 --> 11:09.542
(both scream)

11:13.333 --> 11:14.625
The meteor is coming
right for us.

11:14.709 --> 11:15.709
We've got to do something.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.417
You're right.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.000
Do you really think
that's gonna help?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.458
No, I just don't want to spend

11:24.542 --> 11:26.208
my last few minutes
with a cold neck.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.250
Wait.
I've got it.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.375
Hamsters.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.667
What?

11:35.750 --> 11:36.750
Run like a hamster
in a wheel.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.542
It worked.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.000
You saved our...
Hamsters!

11:53.792 --> 11:57.041
Look, we can't keep
this up forever.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.083
Give me your watch.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.750
What for?

11:59.834 --> 12:00.750
Just do it.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.834
Here.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.375
Just so you know,

12:06.458 --> 12:08.709
you can't stop time
by smashing my watch.

12:10.166 --> 12:12.333
No, I think I know how
to open a space portal.

12:12.417 --> 12:13.750
Do you remember
how Silver Shield

12:13.834 --> 12:15.625
opened a hole
in space by shooting

12:15.709 --> 12:17.417
a neutron blast
through a quartz crystal?

12:17.500 --> 12:19.208
Well, your watch
has a quartz crystal

12:19.291 --> 12:21.250
and cell phones give
off neutron blasts.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.333
No, they don't.

12:22.417 --> 12:24.583
Well, they give off something!

12:24.667 --> 12:27.291
Look, I know you were
right about the costume

12:27.375 --> 12:29.083
and I know you were right
about Tecton helping us,

12:29.166 --> 12:31.542
but this makes absolutely
no sense at all.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.125
Well, do you have
a better idea?

12:33.208 --> 12:35.875
Because by my watch,
we have about a minute to live.

12:35.959 --> 12:37.709
Fine.

12:37.792 --> 12:40.166
Wait, if you have a watch,
why would you break mine?

12:40.250 --> 12:42.291
Because it's part of
a matching set.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.625
Alan, ready
for more Halloween fun?

12:52.709 --> 12:53.875
Do you mind?

12:54.959 --> 12:56.542
I'm trying to work here.

12:56.625 --> 12:57.792
My goodness!

12:57.875 --> 13:01.125
Alan, I love
your Phillip costume.

13:01.208 --> 13:04.000
I'm not Alan.
I'm Phillip.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.709
This is just a sweater vest,

13:05.792 --> 13:08.333
which fit easily over
my embarrassingly tiny head.

13:09.959 --> 13:12.208
Phillip, did Alan
put you up to this?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.458
Where is he?

13:13.542 --> 13:15.250
He made me swear
not to tell you,

13:15.333 --> 13:16.792
so I'm going to tell you.

13:18.041 --> 13:19.583
He snuck out with a bunch
of superheroes

13:19.667 --> 13:21.792
to go to a Halloween party
at a school.

13:21.875 --> 13:25.458
Oh, this is terrible.
Alan's too reckless.

13:25.542 --> 13:27.250
He'll reveal the existence
of superheroes

13:27.333 --> 13:28.667
to the Normo world.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.625
This is all my fault.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.667
I made him believe
he was half-Normo

13:32.750 --> 13:36.625
to preserve the true identity
of his superhero father, Optimo.

13:36.709 --> 13:40.500
Did I do the right thing?
Do the ends justify the means?

13:40.583 --> 13:44.083
I'm sorry, I stopped listening
after you said "asparagus".

13:46.208 --> 13:47.291
I didn't say "asparagus".

13:47.375 --> 13:48.709
You said it a week ago.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.333
I stopped listening
to you a week ago.

13:52.250 --> 13:53.750
Then somebody missed
the ending

13:53.834 --> 13:55.834
of a very exciting
asparagus story.

13:58.875 --> 14:00.333
Okay, it's ready.

14:00.417 --> 14:02.166
I'll open the space
portal on ten.

14:02.250 --> 14:06.792
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

14:06.875 --> 14:09.458
We have no air!
Stop with the Mississippis!

14:10.834 --> 14:12.709
Well, now you
made me lose count.

14:12.792 --> 14:16.709
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi...

14:16.792 --> 14:20.625
Contaminate
superhero powers, check.

14:20.709 --> 14:24.875
Mail cable bill, check.

14:27.291 --> 14:28.834
What am I forgetting?

14:28.917 --> 14:30.166
Oh, right.

14:36.792 --> 14:39.375
You did it!
You saved our lives.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.500
Your crazy idea worked.

14:41.583 --> 14:43.625
And I didn't even get
to ten Mississippi.

14:43.709 --> 14:47.750
Seriously, I am never ever
going to second guess you again.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.500
Good, because we have to get
to the Annihilator's lair.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.333
According to my two watches,

14:52.417 --> 14:54.417
Tecton's been waiting
for us for, like, 10 minutes.

15:02.125 --> 15:03.834
Skylar?

15:03.917 --> 15:05.458
What are you doing here?

15:05.542 --> 15:07.083
Uh...

15:07.166 --> 15:11.458
Kaz and Oliver asked me to
get Snowstorm's powers back.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.083
She's really sick.

15:13.166 --> 15:14.959
You don't seem like
you're in much of a hurry

15:15.041 --> 15:16.917
to get back to Mighty Med.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.667
You've made a pot of tea
and done a crossword puzzle.

15:21.750 --> 15:25.417
By the way, Norwegian tourist
attraction is fjord.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.667
And you're holding a device

15:29.750 --> 15:32.166
that's only purpose
is to contaminate powers.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.333
Tecton, I swear,
you're wrong.

15:34.417 --> 15:35.959
I'm Skylar Storm.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.500
I would never
do anything evil.

15:39.750 --> 15:40.834
Like this, for instance.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.333
Now you will become
Evil Tecton.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.709
Normo log, entry 37:

16:53.792 --> 16:57.083
Baby carrots, baby corn,
baby back ribs.

16:57.166 --> 17:00.083
Normos love to eat babies.

17:04.875 --> 17:06.792
Alan!
How could you?

17:06.875 --> 17:08.750
I specifically told you
not to leave the hospital.

17:08.834 --> 17:10.917
You disobeyed me

17:11.000 --> 17:13.583
and put the secret of the
superhero world in jeopardy.

17:13.667 --> 17:15.709
Don't worry.
I'm learning a lot here.

17:15.792 --> 17:17.750
And besides,
no one even suspects

17:17.834 --> 17:19.709
that these are actual
superheroes.

17:19.792 --> 17:21.583
Everyone!

17:21.667 --> 17:24.792
It's time to announce
the best costume of the night.

17:24.875 --> 17:29.500
Our finalists are two
Dark Warriors and a nerd.

17:30.959 --> 17:32.500
And the winner is...

17:33.834 --> 17:35.458
not this guy.

17:36.792 --> 17:37.875
Congratulations,
Ashton.

17:37.959 --> 17:39.208
You're the winner.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.917
What?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.583
How could you possibly think
his costume is better than mine?

17:43.667 --> 17:46.583
Because your mom obviously
made your costume.

17:46.667 --> 17:48.250
So what if my mom made it?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.709
Can his costume do this?

17:54.041 --> 17:55.500
(all gasping)

18:03.125 --> 18:05.125
This is exactly what
I thought would happen.

18:05.208 --> 18:07.458
Now these kids know
that superheroes exist.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.458
Don't worry.
I think I know what to do.

18:11.583 --> 18:15.250
Ugh. These special effects
are so lame.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.500
They looked totally fake.

18:17.583 --> 18:18.792
(All) Yeah.

18:18.875 --> 18:20.875
I thought they looked amazing,

18:20.959 --> 18:22.625
but I don't want to seem
like I don't fit in,

18:22.709 --> 18:24.250
so I'm going to agree.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.667
Boo!

18:25.750 --> 18:27.375
(All) Boo!

18:29.875 --> 18:32.291
Alan,
that was quick thinking.

18:32.375 --> 18:33.834
How'd you come up
with that?

18:33.917 --> 18:36.542
One thing I've learned
is that Normo teenagers hate

18:36.625 --> 18:39.667
everything and can easily be
whipped up into an angry mob.

18:39.750 --> 18:40.709
Watch.

18:40.792 --> 18:43.250
Hey, that kid has glasses!

18:43.333 --> 18:44.792
Get him!

18:51.542 --> 18:53.834
Alan, I've underestimated you.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.917
I didn't think
that was possible.

19:06.959 --> 19:08.083
Skylar?

19:08.166 --> 19:09.667
What are you doing here?

19:09.750 --> 19:11.959
What happened to Tecton?

19:12.041 --> 19:15.125
My Skylar sense told me
something was wrong.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.291
I got here and found Tecton
trying to steal all the powers.

19:18.375 --> 19:20.750
No, no, no. This is all
a misunderstanding. Okay?

19:20.834 --> 19:23.000
We asked Tecton to meet us
here to get the powers,

19:23.083 --> 19:25.417
but somehow we got
stranded in space.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.875
I'm not pointing any fingers.

19:26.959 --> 19:28.625
I am. It was you!

19:29.667 --> 19:32.208
What the heck?

19:32.291 --> 19:34.250
Sorry.
My powers are still glitchy.

19:34.333 --> 19:37.125
Anyway, I caught Tecton
trying to inject himself

19:37.208 --> 19:39.500
with all these powers
and then he attacked me.

19:39.583 --> 19:42.375
I think he's evil and working
with the Annihilator.

19:42.458 --> 19:45.083
No.
Tecton would never do that.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.875
Tecton is not evil.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.750
He's my boy!

19:49.834 --> 19:51.166
See for yourself.

19:57.583 --> 19:58.917
His insignia turned white.

20:00.417 --> 20:01.375
He is evil.

20:01.458 --> 20:03.917
Can you believe it?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.709
I mean,
you think you know somebody.

20:05.792 --> 20:07.792
Egad!

20:07.875 --> 20:11.208
A four letter word for
"cry of surprise" is "Egad"!

20:26.750 --> 20:28.542
Hey, Skylar, thanks again.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.291
Because of you,
Snowstorm is fine now.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.959
Yeah, but now
it's freezing in here.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.500
Oh, really?
I didn't notice.

20:38.875 --> 20:40.709
I still can't believe
all this time

20:40.792 --> 20:44.667
Tecton was really
the Annihilator's boy.

20:44.750 --> 20:46.125
I know.

20:46.208 --> 20:47.750
But at least you can
restore the powers

20:47.834 --> 20:49.583
of all the superheroes
that Horace contacted.

20:49.667 --> 20:50.667
That's true.

20:52.291 --> 20:53.792
Wait. Wait.

20:53.875 --> 20:56.125
Maybe we should just
hold off a day or two

20:56.208 --> 20:57.792
before we restore
everyone's powers,

20:57.875 --> 20:59.458
just to see if Snowstorm
comes down with

20:59.542 --> 21:00.542
any negative side effects.

21:00.625 --> 21:02.291
You said you weren't
gonna second guess me.

21:02.375 --> 21:05.125
Besides, we restored Skylar's powers
and she's perfectly fine.

21:05.208 --> 21:06.417
Right, Skylar?

21:06.500 --> 21:08.667
Yep. I've never felt better.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.792
Okay, Kaz, let's go
with your instincts

21:12.875 --> 21:14.709
and restore everyone's powers.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.625
(theme music playing)
