00:00.709 --> 00:01.167
Previously
Black Lightning...

00:01.167 --> 00:03.503
I unraveled that
Bitcoin chain.

00:03.544 --> 00:05.129
This is who had you killed.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.674
I like this little hustle that
you got goin' on here.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.884
As of right now,
you work for me.

00:09.926 --> 00:11.928
The case belongs
to Tobias Whale.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.512
I can't turn it on.

00:13.554 --> 00:15.807
He'll find me if I got his.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.059
So, there's a chip in him.
Why don't we just take it out?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.936
The chip is connected
to Khalil's brain.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.103
Removing it would kill him.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.312
Firewall.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.065
[crackling]

00:26.192 --> 00:28.611
He's still in my head, Jen.

00:28.652 --> 00:31.405
-I can't be trusted.
-I trust you.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.658
We're going on to
foreign soil to engage

00:33.700 --> 00:35.909
a ruthless enemy
who knows we're coming.

00:35.951 --> 00:37.954
We're gonna be
outnumbered and outgunned.

00:37.996 --> 00:41.249
I'm looking for Dr. Jace.
Jace killed my mother.

00:41.290 --> 00:42.332
-[Sergeant Grayle] Stop!
-[grunts]

00:43.960 --> 00:45.545
[screaming]

00:45.587 --> 00:48.006
Nobody touches my wife!

00:51.216 --> 00:53.219
-I love you.
-[Jefferson] I love you.

00:53.844 --> 00:55.262
Let's go home.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.400
You know me...

01:10.194 --> 01:11.987
by another name
from another life.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.865
I go by Peter Gambi now,

01:16.200 --> 01:18.036
but no matter how hard
I try to escape,

01:18.078 --> 01:21.289
my past is determined
to haunt me.

01:21.331 --> 01:24.375
This war between the ASA
and Markovia should've...

01:24.417 --> 01:26.335
could've been prevented,

01:26.376 --> 01:28.462
if I had only
disobeyed one order.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.801
I should've killed you
40 years ago, Dr. Jace.

01:34.885 --> 01:36.638
But you didn't, did you?

01:37.847 --> 01:40.057
I was forced to
work for both sides,

01:40.099 --> 01:41.308
and let me tell you,

01:41.350 --> 01:43.394
if Markovia wins
this meta arms race,

01:43.436 --> 01:47.189
we and everything
we know will cease
to exist.

01:47.231 --> 01:49.234
So, whether you understand
that or not,

01:49.275 --> 01:51.402
we're fighting
on the same side now.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.079
You were their prisoner
for months.

02:02.996 --> 02:05.040
Tell me about their leader.

02:05.082 --> 02:07.418
I believe you've met him.

02:07.459 --> 02:10.462
He answers to
the name Gravedigger.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.426
And what does Gravedigger
want here in Freeland?

02:16.468 --> 02:18.096
Your stable metas.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.848
All of them.

02:22.641 --> 02:25.270
The mission was a success.

02:25.311 --> 02:29.731
My team managed
to retrieve Dr. Stewart
and Dr. Jace from Markovia.

02:29.774 --> 02:30.650
Hmm.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.444
Dr. Jace, how fortunate.

02:34.486 --> 02:37.448
I do look forward
to debriefing her.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.616
No, not a chance.

02:39.658 --> 02:41.828
I'm holding you to our deal.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.456
All members of my team
are to be erased from
the ASA records,

02:45.497 --> 02:47.792
including Dr. Jace.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.460
Under whose authority?

02:51.253 --> 02:55.841
I noticed you failed
to mention you let
Tobias Whale escape.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.384
There was an audible
in play.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.181
This was supposed to
be a covert mission.

03:02.223 --> 03:05.185
Your team botched it
so completely,

03:05.225 --> 03:08.228
the Markovians now have
Freeland surrounded.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.480
Sounds like
an ASA problem to me.

03:10.522 --> 03:14.068
Major Grey...
you are dismissed.

03:15.986 --> 03:17.237
[scoffs]

03:22.117 --> 03:26.580
Erica Moran's been
returned to her family.

03:26.622 --> 03:33.629
Her identity, as well as
those of every member
of your team

03:33.670 --> 03:36.382
will be excised,
including that of Dr. Jace.

03:40.969 --> 03:42.013
There's more.

03:43.473 --> 03:47.018
We came across
an American meta in Markovia.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.353
Now, my intel says
he's heading to Freeland,

03:49.395 --> 03:52.314
leading the Markovian invasion.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.985
Calls himself...
Gravedigger?

03:58.237 --> 04:00.740
I'm not familiar
with that name...

04:02.407 --> 04:06.162
but rest assured,
I will perform
the due diligence.

04:06.204 --> 04:11.251
Am I to assume
I can count on you
in the coming war?

04:12.001 --> 04:12.877
No.

04:14.878 --> 04:15.921
Freeland can.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.007
Okay, here I come.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.095
Okay, okay,
that's enough, Anissa.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.637
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I know.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.305
[sighs]

04:24.346 --> 04:27.891
Dad said it'll help
after the fight in Markovia.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.894
I really wish I had
your abilities right now.

04:30.937 --> 04:34.481
God, who thought ice
would hurt more than a punch?

04:34.524 --> 04:37.526
Maybe you can ask Painkiller
to take your pain away.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.237
Please don't call him that.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.115
His name's Khalil.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.115
Plus, we're not
talkin' about him.

04:43.156 --> 04:46.326
You lost those privileges
when you conveniently
forgot to tell me he's alive.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.911
Yeah, well, he has
an assassin trapped

04:47.954 --> 04:49.997
in that chip in his head.
He's a ticking time bomb.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.418
He still needs my help.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.461
No one should have
to face what he went
through by themselves.

04:55.502 --> 04:56.045
You know that.

04:56.086 --> 04:58.255
Jen, what happens
if Painkiller gets loose?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.423
He is a killer.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.884
He helped protect
all of us in Markovia.

05:01.925 --> 05:03.511
He seems like
he's in control to me.

05:05.887 --> 05:06.930
Look...

05:07.889 --> 05:08.850
I know you love him, Jen,

05:08.850 --> 05:12.353
but the two of you are
not the same people you
were when you fell in love.

05:12.394 --> 05:13.478
[breathing deeply]

05:13.521 --> 05:15.105
You have never met Painkiller.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.442
I'm telling you,
he is a wild animal.

05:18.608 --> 05:20.610
-He's a wild animal?
-Yes.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.822
Whose girlfriend spends
most of their time roaming
Freeland as a leopard?

05:23.865 --> 05:25.783
Oh. That was a low blow.

05:25.824 --> 05:26.867
It's true.

05:27.576 --> 05:29.661
The difference?

05:29.704 --> 05:33.081
Grace knows who I am
in all of her forms and
she never hurt me.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.375
Can you say
the same about Khalil?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.716
That looks light.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.386
You're not holdin' out
on Lala, are you, Lady Eve?

05:45.427 --> 05:48.473
Now, you know you
gotta kick out 30% to
keep operating in Freeland.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.475
That's exactly what
Lala and I agreed upon.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.060
Count it.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.819
Devonte, isn't it?

06:03.403 --> 06:06.406
We're gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

06:06.449 --> 06:10.411
I prefer our interactions
be pleasant.

06:10.452 --> 06:14.499
Did any of my girls
happen to catch your eye?

06:14.540 --> 06:16.709
You know you can
take your pick.

06:17.709 --> 06:19.670
This is about business.

06:19.711 --> 06:21.129
I ain't here for pleasure.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.007
Lala and I
are business partners,

06:23.048 --> 06:27.261
and he should know
the quality of our product.

06:27.302 --> 06:31.139
And since he feels
it beneath him,

06:31.182 --> 06:34.185
that duty falls squarely
upon his lieutenant.

06:38.730 --> 06:40.066
[chuckles]

06:41.233 --> 06:42.776
[fizzing]

07:06.466 --> 07:07.384
Right here.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.595
Excellent choice.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.973
Shalon will fulfill
your every desire.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.199
Your firewall's
holding up, Khalil.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.076
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

07:32.117 --> 07:33.161
No, thanks, TC.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.829
I don't need anything.

07:34.870 --> 07:35.829
Yes, you do.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.504
Okay, what am I
supposed to do with that?

07:44.922 --> 07:47.216
Idle hands are
the devil's playground.

07:47.257 --> 07:49.259
Jen told me that
you are an accomplished artist.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.761
The world needs more artists.

07:50.802 --> 07:52.637
No, the world doesn't need me.

07:54.807 --> 07:59.019
Listen, Khalil, I've had
my own struggles with PTSD.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.064
What helped me was finding
a safe emotional structure.

08:02.105 --> 08:04.065
I found that in tailoring.

08:04.108 --> 08:06.860
I'd lose myself for hours
in the stitching and fabrics.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.654
And seeing that I could
create something of value

08:09.697 --> 08:13.117
helped me get out of
the dark places that my mind
would get trapped in.

08:17.913 --> 08:20.582
Thanks, but I'll be okay.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.043
I can take care of myself.

08:23.084 --> 08:26.088
You're one tough cookie, kid,
no doubt about that,

08:26.129 --> 08:30.300
but PTSD is not an enemy
anyone should handle
by themselves.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.427
Would you be
willing to talk with
someone about it?

08:32.470 --> 08:35.139
Right, and what therapist
is gonna take a patient

08:35.181 --> 08:36.224
who murdered his own mother?

08:39.018 --> 08:40.311
Once this occupation's over,

08:40.352 --> 08:41.979
I'm gonna get you
the help you need.

08:42.687 --> 08:44.315
I have a friend, Perenna.

08:44.356 --> 08:46.067
She's used to tough cases.

08:46.107 --> 08:48.068
She helped Jennifer
through a rough patch.

08:48.693 --> 08:49.986
But until then...

this long to manifest.

Knowing you could fix it.

If I'd gone after you

I get that, but we're
in Freeland now.

It seems more like
an execution than justice.

13:11.039 --> 13:13.082
and we will get through
this. You'll see.

13:14.418 --> 13:15.628
Thank you, sweetheart.

13:16.961 --> 13:18.422
Never have to thank me, Mom.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.388
All right, well,
I'll let you freshen up.

13:26.429 --> 13:27.681
-Dinner's ready.
-Okay.

13:43.989 --> 13:49.036
♪ It's hard to take
All of this hate ♪

13:51.621 --> 13:57.878
♪ It's hard to take
All of this hate ♪

14:00.089 --> 14:00.965
That's exactly
why I told Odell

14:00.965 --> 14:06.886
that I would lead the
defense of Freeland
if the Markovians attack.

14:06.928 --> 14:08.429
Someone has to keep
an eye on that, yeah?

14:08.471 --> 14:12.433
Well, Dad, I don't understand
why it has to be you.

14:12.475 --> 14:15.980
Well, actually, I was hoping
it would be all of us.

14:20.942 --> 14:22.820
Okay, look, I understand
your hesitation,

14:22.861 --> 14:26.490
but if anyone has
a better idea, I'm listening.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.826
Mmm, well, yeah,
Odell needs to go.
Like, for real.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.870
Yeah. I'm with Jen
on this one.

14:34.038 --> 14:37.084
Well, sometimes
it's easier to work with
the devil you know.

14:37.125 --> 14:40.587
Odell fractured us
and nearly destroyed
our family, so...

14:41.880 --> 14:44.466
Your mother and I discussed
that we need a reset.

14:44.508 --> 14:46.384
A do-over. But in order
for that to happen--

14:46.427 --> 14:48.345
We need a clean slate.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.097
No more secrets.

14:53.057 --> 14:54.643
I, um...

14:56.895 --> 14:59.440
I found my last
hidden stash of glimmer.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.442
I tried to flush it, but...

15:04.278 --> 15:05.278
I couldn't.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.745
Look,

15:13.787 --> 15:16.789
no one survives addiction
without support, okay?

15:19.418 --> 15:20.628
We're here for you.

15:21.419 --> 15:22.504
Yeah.

15:23.254 --> 15:24.173
I got you, Mom.

15:24.213 --> 15:25.466
[crackling]

15:36.393 --> 15:38.729
Okay, I guess it's my turn.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.692
All right, guys, I think...

15:46.528 --> 15:49.072
I think Grace might
be the one.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.368
Mmm. We see that in your eyes
every time you look at her.

15:52.408 --> 15:53.744
-You still owe us a secret.
-What you mean?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.620
I ain't got nothin' to say!
I'm open book!

15:55.663 --> 15:56.913
[chuckles]

15:56.956 --> 15:57.998
What about you?

16:02.503 --> 16:05.839
Like I said,
clean slate, honey.

16:06.881 --> 16:07.924
No judgement.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.009
All right. Um...

16:10.052 --> 16:14.014
Dad already knows, but
I've been working with Odell.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.392
He groomed me as an ASA asset

16:16.432 --> 16:19.644
and he tricked me
into killin' a bunch
of Markovians.

16:19.687 --> 16:22.105
He didn't tell me that
they were Markovian soldiers

16:22.147 --> 16:24.107
in the data farm
he had me nuke.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.025
I'm so sorry.

16:27.903 --> 16:31.365
Odell tricked me into
using glimmer without
my knowledge as well.

16:32.783 --> 16:33.741
Look at me.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.578
You did what
you thought was right.

16:39.664 --> 16:40.832
But it wasn't, though.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.003
[Jefferson clears throat]

16:44.043 --> 16:48.841
Well, I witnessed the erasing
of multiple universes.

16:48.881 --> 16:51.927
And I helped save the universe
that we all live in now,

16:51.969 --> 16:56.724
so, you know,
I just had that...
little tidbit.

16:56.764 --> 16:59.559
[chuckling] Oh, come on, Dad.
Why do you always gotta
one-up us?

16:59.600 --> 17:00.476
I mean...

17:01.186 --> 17:03.105
Yeah. [laughing]

17:03.147 --> 17:05.648
Okay, on that note,
do you wanna bless this mess?

17:05.691 --> 17:06.858
[laughing]

17:08.609 --> 17:09.944
[Jefferson sighs]

17:09.987 --> 17:11.446
This food we're about
to receive,

17:11.488 --> 17:13.406
we are truly,
truly thankful for.

17:13.906 --> 17:14.782
Amen.

17:14.825 --> 17:15.701
Amen.

17:17.536 --> 17:18.746
All right, let's eat.

17:18.787 --> 17:19.997
-Please.
-[Jennifer laughing]

17:28.838 --> 17:29.839
Fall back.

17:29.839 --> 17:34.427
I'm not changin' our terms
of agreement, if this is what
this is about, Lady Eve.

17:36.055 --> 17:40.517
Our agreement
is quite satisfactory.

17:40.558 --> 17:43.103
I've asked you here
for a personal matter.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.814
[chuckles]

17:45.855 --> 17:48.692
Well, look at you
gettin' all familiar.

17:48.733 --> 17:50.818
Maybe I raise the fee
for you wastin' my time.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.195
Say another 5%?

17:55.406 --> 17:57.701
[laughing]

18:10.422 --> 18:13.842
I understand you have
a certain briefcase in
your possession.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.386
One you can't open.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.138
I don't know nothin'
about no briefcase.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.473
Oh, Lala...

18:21.557 --> 18:24.435
you know these streets.
They talk.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.897
And you know what
a good listener I am.

18:30.733 --> 18:32.111
If I had such a thing...

18:33.362 --> 18:34.738
why would I hand it
over to you?

18:36.198 --> 18:41.036
Because I can give you
what you truly want.

18:41.077 --> 18:44.539
That briefcase is
the only thing that will
bring Tobias Whale to me.

18:44.580 --> 18:46.791
And when he comes to collect,

18:46.834 --> 18:49.211
I'll have my revenge
come hell or high water.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.212
[chuckling]

18:51.255 --> 18:52.631
Oh. [chuckling]

18:52.673 --> 18:55.008
Oh, Lala...

18:56.551 --> 19:01.140
what will you do
when you catch
the white whale?

19:02.974 --> 19:04.433
Oh, right.

19:05.309 --> 19:06.644
You can't harm him.

19:09.105 --> 19:11.023
Tobias programmed you.

19:15.069 --> 19:16.571
How you know that?

19:16.613 --> 19:18.906
E pluribus unum.

19:24.203 --> 19:25.913
Sit your ass down!

19:25.955 --> 19:26.957
[grunts]

19:33.212 --> 19:35.840
You never worked
for Tobias Whale.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.218
You worked for me.

19:39.135 --> 19:41.762
I ran the Shadow Board.

19:41.805 --> 19:47.935
technology
leash.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.520
[shuddering]

19:50.314 --> 19:52.231
I can undo that for you, baby.

19:54.859 --> 19:57.904
Imperium in Imperio.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.741
[breathing heavily]

20:05.787 --> 20:07.288
[grunts]

20:13.377 --> 20:15.463
[Lady Eve chuckling]

20:15.505 --> 20:18.342
Now, does that
sound like something

20:18.383 --> 20:24.096
the Godfather of Freeland
would be interested in?

20:25.182 --> 20:27.058
Babe, Jen is so stubborn

20:27.099 --> 20:30.604
and infuriating
sometimes that it makes
me wanna... [grunts]

20:30.645 --> 20:32.314
Can't imagine
what that's like.

20:33.231 --> 20:33.941
You joke.

20:33.941 --> 20:37.486
But she refuses to believe
that Painkiller is dangerous.

20:37.527 --> 20:41.530
It's like, he'll never
be Khalil, right?
Why can't she see that?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.115
Isn't it obvious?

20:43.157 --> 20:46.244
It's her first love.
She'll fight tooth
and nail for him.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.205
It's like the more
I push, the more
she just rushes to him.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.460
With everything that's
going on, your sister
has a lot to process.

20:53.501 --> 20:55.170
I mean, cut her some slack.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.048
So, that's what you would do?

20:59.590 --> 21:03.428
I would help my girlfriend
paint her nails, you know?

21:03.470 --> 21:05.638
Share a romantic
moment together.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.766
Come on, sit down already.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.476
Fine.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.105
But if he hurts her,
I'mma put his ass
in the ground

21:13.145 --> 21:15.315
and I'mma make sure
it sticks this time.

21:15.356 --> 21:19.694
From what I can see,
Jen can take care of herself.

21:19.736 --> 21:23.073
Anissa, you have
an urgent call from
the Perdi farm.

21:24.031 --> 21:25.866
Shonda, put it through.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.869
Blackbird, are you there?
It's Anaya. Please, come in.

21:28.912 --> 21:29.954
Oh, my God.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.170
Anaya, it's Blackbird.
What's goin' on?

21:37.211 --> 21:39.923
Markovians found us.
It's a massacre.

21:39.964 --> 21:43.175
I'm leading what's left
of the Perdi to make a run
for the safety of Freeland.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.721
Meet us at
the ASA checkpoint, but hurry.

21:45.761 --> 21:47.263
Shonda, call Black Lightning.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.849
Have him meet me
at the ASA Checkpoint Charlie.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.643
Suit up.

22:00.152 --> 22:00.652
Dr. Jace!

22:00.693 --> 22:02.695
[Jennifer] Hey!
We're here to talk.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.700
She wants to talk?
Then let's talk.

22:06.741 --> 22:08.743
Start by sayin'
why you experimented

22:08.785 --> 22:10.746
on my mom while
she was pregnant with me.

22:10.787 --> 22:14.583
[chuckles] The child with
the earth-based powers.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.792
Your mother...
Helen, wasn't it?

22:16.835 --> 22:19.587
Oh, yes, she was lovely.
I was very fond of her.

22:19.628 --> 22:21.048
Say her name again.

22:25.134 --> 22:28.137
[Jennifer] Brandon!
Brandon! Hey, Brandon,
stop. You promised.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.640
I promised you
wouldn't kill her.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.519
My mother will.

22:34.560 --> 22:37.064
Justice is balance.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.607
A life for a life.

22:40.358 --> 22:44.278
You used your powers
to crystallize your
mother's ashes

22:44.320 --> 22:47.949
and wore her your
entire life waiting
for this moment?

22:47.990 --> 22:49.492
Hey, stop talkin'.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.163
Those powers
you're flaunting,
I gave you those.

22:53.204 --> 22:54.580
You cursed me.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.957
You took away my life.

22:55.999 --> 22:57.834
And gave you this one!

22:57.875 --> 22:59.377
A "thank you" would suffice.

22:59.419 --> 23:00.503
Brandon... No!

23:03.048 --> 23:04.465
Back up.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.845
When I helped your
mother escape Markovia,

23:08.886 --> 23:12.516
your father tried to kill me
with very similar powers.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.351
Guess the apple
doesn't fall far.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.434
Maybe you and he should talk.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.104
All right, it's time to go.

23:17.144 --> 23:19.772
She knew my pops.
I thought he was dead.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.108
Kill me and you'll
never find out the truth.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.859
[impact grunting]

23:23.902 --> 23:24.944
Brandon, stop!

23:27.614 --> 23:28.531
Let's go!

23:29.699 --> 23:30.659
You're lucky!

23:35.247 --> 23:37.039
-Markovian forces
are advancing.
-[people screaming]

23:37.082 --> 23:39.041
Form a line and
protect the refugees.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.384
Looks like you could
use the assist.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.472
Let's go! Get behind me.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.773
[men yelling]

24:07.988 --> 24:09.655
[indistinct shouting]

24:14.243 --> 24:15.744
[Anissa] How about
we give 'em a little
Lightning and Thunder?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.497
With a touch of Grace.

24:17.538 --> 24:18.789
[Black Lightning] All right,
I'll take care of the Perdi.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.752
-[Anissa inhales deeply]
-[man screaming]

24:29.884 --> 24:31.635
-[blows landing]
-[man screaming]

24:39.769 --> 24:42.355
That's all I can remember.

24:42.396 --> 24:45.275
They say the Markovians
swarmed the Perdi farm.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.903
-Took Anaya and Thierry.
-[Anissa sighs]

24:47.943 --> 24:50.279
Look, I forced the Perdi
to help, so this is on me.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.531
Anaya and Thierry took me in
when I needed help.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.742
We can't leave them
in Markovian hands.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.952
What's gonna happen
to these refugees?

24:56.994 --> 24:59.955
ASA doesn't have
enough supplies to help...

24:59.998 --> 25:01.374
but I think I can.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.125
I know a guy.

25:04.294 --> 25:04.752
All right.

25:04.752 --> 25:06.505
We'll go get Anaya
and Thierry.

25:09.924 --> 25:11.300
-[slapping]
-[breathing heavily]

25:14.930 --> 25:16.890
Now that I have
your full attention,

25:16.932 --> 25:20.644
I trust you'll take
this message to
your boss, Lady Eve.

25:22.979 --> 25:27.107
You tell her the Tailor
sends his regards.

25:27.150 --> 25:30.737
And next time you plan
to assassinate someone...

25:30.778 --> 25:32.072
[cutting]

25:32.113 --> 25:33.448
don't miss.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.657
Get out of here!

25:42.164 --> 25:45.085
If anyone can find
out the truth about
your father, it's TC.

25:45.125 --> 25:46.670
So, go ask him or I will.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.462
Didn't you want me
to think things through?

25:48.505 --> 25:50.464
Let me think, then. Damn.

25:50.507 --> 25:52.509
You know, you're just
as stubborn as my father.

25:54.009 --> 25:56.011
You and your pops
got the same powers, right?

25:56.054 --> 25:56.512
I mean, I guess.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.557
I'm kind of
an upgrade, though.

25:58.597 --> 26:00.016
Black Lightning 2.0.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.436
What if Jace is right?

26:04.479 --> 26:06.730
What if I take after my pops
like you do yours?

26:06.772 --> 26:07.982
Earth-based powers?

26:08.023 --> 26:09.692
Well, if that's true,
it makes sense.

26:09.733 --> 26:12.653
But if you kill Jace,
you'll never find out.

26:12.695 --> 26:15.699
She's not gonna tell you
the truth anyway, just her
own twisted version of it.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.866
So, go talk to TC
and stop being stubborn.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.411
[exhales deeply]

26:22.788 --> 26:24.583
TC, got a sec?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.250
Yeah.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.381
What you doin'?

26:32.590 --> 26:34.134
You know, keepin' busy.

26:35.426 --> 26:38.221
It helps with, well...

26:39.972 --> 26:40.890
you know.

26:40.932 --> 26:41.932
Yeah, I do know.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.020
If you need anyone
to talk to, I'm here.

26:46.061 --> 26:49.566
Everybody keeps saying
you're dangerous, but
I don't believe any of that.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.192
I know you'd never hurt me.

26:51.233 --> 26:51.651
Thanks.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.572
But can you turn
to the right?

26:55.614 --> 26:57.031
I wanna grab that profile.

26:57.073 --> 26:58.741
[clicks tongue,
clears throat]

26:58.782 --> 27:00.242
[chuckles]

27:01.786 --> 27:03.413
I need a favor, man.

27:03.454 --> 27:06.499
To help you find
your pops because
Dr. Jace is a liar, right?

27:06.540 --> 27:08.500
[TC chuckling]

27:08.542 --> 27:11.755
Hey, sound travels
pretty well here, man.

27:11.796 --> 27:14.007
Yeah, you might want to be
a little bit quiet.

27:14.048 --> 27:15.592
Appreciate you, man.

27:15.634 --> 27:16.675
[Jennifer] Khalil?

27:17.426 --> 27:19.511
Khalil?

27:19.554 --> 27:21.806
-Oh, no. Hey, Khalil!
-TC, I think he's
glitchin' again.

27:23.098 --> 27:23.974
Khalil?

27:26.019 --> 27:27.936
Yeah, he's
definitely glitching.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.772
What are you waiting for,
an invitation?

27:29.814 --> 27:31.857
-Go in there and save him.
-Yeah, come on!

27:43.161 --> 27:45.872
Didn't I tell you,
you can't keep me
here forever?

27:47.248 --> 27:49.084
I still have my mission.

27:50.501 --> 27:52.170
Kill the Pierce family.

27:54.213 --> 27:55.714
And when I get out of here...

27:57.092 --> 28:00.720
I'm gonna make you
watch and listen...

28:01.762 --> 28:03.682
as they scream,

28:03.722 --> 28:04.932
as they beg.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.448
[grunting]

28:20.490 --> 28:22.241
I want you
to watch her die.

28:22.282 --> 28:23.992
Khalil, you're hurting me.

28:27.329 --> 28:28.832
Khalil, you're hurting me.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.417
Khalil, please.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.086
No.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.713
[grunts]

28:47.267 --> 28:49.184
[struggling]

28:49.227 --> 28:50.310
Khalil, please.

28:51.895 --> 28:53.272
[straining] Khalil,
you're hurting me.

28:56.567 --> 28:57.861
[screaming]

29:04.241 --> 29:05.285
[door shuts]

29:08.747 --> 29:10.874
-[shouting]
-[banging]

29:16.378 --> 29:17.337
[gasps]

29:17.380 --> 29:19.382
[grunts, coughing]

29:19.423 --> 29:20.633
[breathing heavily]

29:20.674 --> 29:22.176
[panting]

29:27.766 --> 29:29.057
[groaning]

29:39.109 --> 29:40.569
[exhaling deeply]

29:56.795 --> 29:57.753
Don't take another step.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.838
Yo, it's me, Jen.

30:01.173 --> 30:02.342
Khalil.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.259
For how long?

30:05.345 --> 30:06.930
You know, my sister
was right about you.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.640
I don't know
how I was so blind.

30:13.353 --> 30:15.188
I came to apologize.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.481
Look, I...

30:18.942 --> 30:21.027
I'm not myself anymore.

30:24.071 --> 30:26.825
I don't know who I am.

30:26.865 --> 30:30.787
But I do know that
Painkiller is a part of me
and he's not goin' away.

30:30.828 --> 30:34.082
And I have to learn
to live with him.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.959
I don't.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.961
I know you can't see him...

30:39.002 --> 30:42.089
but when I look into
Painkiller's eyes, there's
nothin' there but death.

30:42.131 --> 30:45.844
Odell made me a weapon,
but I know...

30:48.512 --> 30:55.228
I know deep down
that I still have
a soul, Jen.

30:55.269 --> 30:58.897
And I need you more
than anyone to believe that.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.692
What Odell did to you
was evil...

31:02.652 --> 31:05.989
but I can't love a weapon
that's pointed at my family,

31:06.029 --> 31:07.531
even if it does have a soul.

31:22.963 --> 31:24.339
See you around, Khalil.

31:28.010 --> 31:29.095
No.

31:31.138 --> 31:32.015
You won't.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.021
[bell dinging]

31:43.734 --> 31:45.068
[gun cocking]

31:48.573 --> 31:49.949
[chuckles]

31:49.990 --> 31:52.576
I received your message.

31:52.618 --> 31:56.413
You know, Gambi,
an e-mail would've sufficed.

31:56.455 --> 31:58.833
An old friend like you
deserves a personal touch.

31:58.875 --> 32:01.544
"An eye for an eye."

32:01.586 --> 32:04.797
You're getting literal
in your old age.

32:04.838 --> 32:07.299
Well, at least I can tell
my twins apart now.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.218
Speak your piece, Evelyn.

32:09.259 --> 32:11.304
One way or another,
our feud ends now.

32:15.849 --> 32:16.392
Okay.

32:18.394 --> 32:23.398
I did set a contract
for your life, true.

32:23.441 --> 32:28.320
But after you took out
Joey Toledo, Tobias had
me killed.

32:29.571 --> 32:31.531
I got better, so...

32:33.284 --> 32:34.535
bygones?

32:35.827 --> 32:36.913
What do you want?

32:38.455 --> 32:40.458
[chuckles] Same old Gambi.

32:41.584 --> 32:42.585
Don't fret.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.006
I come bearing gifts.

32:51.677 --> 32:54.471
We both worked
for the ASA, so...

32:54.513 --> 32:56.682
I don't need to tell you
what this is, do I?

32:57.307 --> 32:59.018
Where did you get it?

32:59.059 --> 33:00.603
Let's say it fell off a truck.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.731
I can't open it.

33:04.773 --> 33:07.943
You always were
more capable when it
came to things like this.

33:09.569 --> 33:11.905
I taught you better
than that, Evelyn.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.615
"Never give something
for nothing."

33:13.657 --> 33:15.993
I was gonna get to that part.

33:17.953 --> 33:24.751
In my absence,
the ASA shattered Freeland.

33:26.837 --> 33:28.673
Take this peace offering.

33:32.426 --> 33:37.056
Use it to burn down
the ASA for what they
did to my city.

33:38.516 --> 33:39.392
Or not.

33:40.727 --> 33:46.606
Either way, my quarrel
with the Tailor is over.

34:11.048 --> 34:12.759
Good. You're here.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.094
I have to tell you
about Khalil.

34:15.135 --> 34:16.094
He left, didn't he?

34:17.012 --> 34:18.264
Yes, but that's not all.

34:18.306 --> 34:18.806
It'll have to wait.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.268
This is our top priority
as of right now.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.362
[clicks]

34:45.583 --> 34:46.626
Wow.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.213
Would you look at that?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.891
I appreciate you both coming.

35:01.932 --> 35:03.059
This simply couldn't wait.

35:04.684 --> 35:06.771
Looks like
the nuclear football.

35:06.813 --> 35:07.896
Might be worse.

35:10.817 --> 35:15.780
This briefcase
contains the genome

35:15.822 --> 35:19.074
of every meta the ASA
has ever come in
contact with.

35:19.117 --> 35:23.788
It self-updates every time
the ASA inputs new data
into their systems.

35:23.829 --> 35:25.831
But this goes far deeper
than just the ASA.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.585
What are you saying, Gambi?

35:29.626 --> 35:31.378
The United States
is responsible

35:31.420 --> 35:32.588
for starting and funding

35:32.630 --> 35:34.757
the Markovian meta
research program

35:34.798 --> 35:37.175
decades before they brought
that research to the States.

35:37.217 --> 35:41.429
And it all began with
an American soldier
named Tyson Sykes,

35:41.472 --> 35:42.764
or as we all know him...

35:43.557 --> 35:44.599
Gravedigger.

35:48.019 --> 35:50.606
And like many soldiers
of the period, he
suffered daily abuse

35:50.648 --> 35:53.650
at the hands of those
that felt that people with
his skin color didn't belong.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.987
[clanging]

35:57.028 --> 36:00.615
Look at that, somebody
threw away a perfectly
good coon.

36:00.657 --> 36:02.492
[laughing]

36:06.246 --> 36:07.831
[grunts]

36:07.873 --> 36:09.083
[man] Hey, get off of him.

36:21.679 --> 36:22.889
[tray clangs]

36:22.929 --> 36:24.181
[both grunting]

36:26.349 --> 36:28.561
[blows landing]

36:28.603 --> 36:29.478
[yells]

36:34.065 --> 36:36.318
The government
gave Sykes a choice.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.489
Court martial or volunteer
for their enhanced
soldier program.

36:40.530 --> 36:41.865
Sykes chose lab rat.

36:42.949 --> 36:44.327
[grunts]

36:44.367 --> 36:47.038
[Sykes groaning]

36:47.079 --> 36:49.164
[screaming]

36:49.206 --> 36:51.666
[gasping]

36:51.708 --> 36:53.920
The program killed
hundreds of soldiers...

36:54.920 --> 36:57.757
but not Sykes.
He was different.

36:57.797 --> 37:01.010
Their experiments activated
his dormant meta gene...

37:01.052 --> 37:02.052
[gasping]

37:02.052 --> 37:05.514
...giving him
superhuman strength,
slowing the aging process,

37:05.556 --> 37:08.516
and the power to push his will
on to others...

37:08.559 --> 37:10.018
that we've all experienced.

37:11.186 --> 37:13.188
Ah! [panting]

37:16.943 --> 37:20.362
The US military
sent Sykes on countless
secret missions,

37:20.403 --> 37:24.032
earning him the moniker
that he answers to today,
Gravedigger.

37:24.074 --> 37:25.409

Tyson Sykes
is the first metahuman
in recorded history.

38:33.643 --> 38:34.686
Meta-prime.

38:34.728 --> 38:36.605
If the US government
had the serum

38:36.646 --> 38:39.483
to unlock meta powers
this entire time,

38:39.525 --> 38:41.318
where is their meta army?

38:41.360 --> 38:46.364
The only part of the
program that survived
was Gravedigger himself.

38:46.407 --> 38:51.077
And for the past 70-plus years,
the US has spent billions

38:51.119 --> 38:53.079
trying to recreate
the original serum.

38:53.121 --> 38:56.708
First in Markovia,
then here in Freeland.

38:56.751 --> 39:00.086
What is so special
about Markovia?

39:00.128 --> 39:03.257
During the Cold War,
it was the perfect
strategic location.

39:03.298 --> 39:07.344
Close to Russia,
and lacking laws against
human experimentation.

39:07.385 --> 39:09.637
That is, until the Markovian
government was overthrown

39:09.679 --> 39:10.972
and the US was kicked out.

39:11.014 --> 39:12.891
You were stationed
in Markovia.

39:13.434 --> 39:14.393
No.

39:15.853 --> 39:17.730
I was sent there
after the coup.

39:17.771 --> 39:20.273
My covert mission...

39:20.315 --> 39:23.318
was to extract
the lead scientist
of their meta program.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.320
Dr. Jace.

39:25.987 --> 39:28.824
Which led to the start
of the ASA,

39:28.865 --> 39:31.369
and the beginning
of the vaccine program
here in Freeland.

39:33.244 --> 39:36.164
Every US president since FDR
has known about

39:36.206 --> 39:37.750
and funded
this program.

39:37.791 --> 39:39.835
And now we're holding
the only proof.

39:40.668 --> 39:41.461
[Jefferson] This is insane.

39:41.503 --> 39:45.423
The US government has
operated this program
around the world

39:45.465 --> 39:47.717
with no one's knowledge
for nearly a century.

39:48.594 --> 39:49.302
The world needs to know.

39:49.344 --> 39:53.974
I don't understand
how Gravedigger
landed in Markovia.

39:54.016 --> 39:55.684
Odell claims
he's never heard of him.

39:55.726 --> 39:58.019
I don't think he has.

39:58.061 --> 40:02.233
You have to have direct access
to this briefcase in order
to know those secrets.

40:02.273 --> 40:04.360
Even in my ASA days,
I never learned about him.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.443
It seems that after the war,

40:05.443 --> 40:09.697
Gravedigger refused to live
in a country that never
wanted him in the first place.

40:09.739 --> 40:12.617
He was a key factor
in the Markovian coup.

40:12.659 --> 40:15.121
And he's been there
ever since,
living like a king.

40:15.161 --> 40:18.541
And now he's in charge
of the Markovian military.

40:18.581 --> 40:21.168
And he has a serious grudge
against the ASA,
the United States,

40:21.210 --> 40:22.460
and probably us.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.297
Beat him once,
we'll do it again.

40:25.338 --> 40:26.632
[Lynn] No,
you don't understand.

40:29.050 --> 40:29.552
I left the formula

40:29.552 --> 40:31.594
for the meta-boost serum
in Markovia.

40:34.181 --> 40:38.143
What happens if Gravedigger
can have any meta power
he wants?

40:39.394 --> 40:40.813
He'd be unstoppable.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.650
[sighing]

40:50.655 --> 40:53.576
Transport to Freeland
has been secured.

40:53.617 --> 40:58.539
However, we were unable
to track down the albino.

40:59.123 --> 41:01.166
He is lost to us.

41:02.710 --> 41:05.003
have me do?

41:11.885 --> 41:12.844
Colonel Mosin...

41:14.429 --> 41:16.974
Markovia thanks you
for your service.

41:19.476 --> 41:20.186
[choking]

41:20.226 --> 41:24.148
But, unfortunately,
your services are
no longer needed.

41:24.648 --> 41:25.523
[bone cracks]

41:26.983 --> 41:27.902
[body thuds]

41:28.568 --> 41:29.570
[speaks Russian]

41:29.612 --> 41:30.820
[speaks English]

41:33.657 --> 41:34.992
And vengeance, doctor.

41:35.992 --> 41:37.827
Ultimate vengeance...

41:38.829 --> 41:40.289
in one man.
