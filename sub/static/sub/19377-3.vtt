WEBVTT

00:16.517 --> 00:17.476
Stop!

00:18.560 --> 00:21.855
Haven't you ever valued
human lives before?!

00:21.939 --> 00:24.942
So, what about that friend of yours
who helped you escape?

00:25.525 --> 00:27.194
I don't need him anymore.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.780
Shut up!

00:30.364 --> 00:32.366
You idiot.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.244
You idiot!

00:35.327 --> 00:37.412
<i>Flight TA167, departing Haneda Airport,</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:40.582
<i>had to make an emergency landing</i>
<i>in the waters just off the coast.</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:45.003
<i>It-- It was Sato. No doubt about it.</i>

00:46.546 --> 00:48.548
<i>He-- He shot the guards...</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:52.427
<i>and then Mr. Saku... Sakurai.</i>

00:55.347 --> 00:58.892
<i>After that... the door... blew off.</i>

01:00.811 --> 01:02.854
RESCUED PASSENGER

01:02.938 --> 01:05.357
<i>And for the murders of Mr. Wakai</i>
<i>and Mr. Sakurai,</i>

01:05.941 --> 01:09.611
<i>we are determined to put our honor</i>
<i>and pride on the line</i>

01:09.695 --> 01:13.240
in order for us to finally capture Sato,

01:13.824 --> 01:15.993
the mastermind behind these incidents.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.663
01 WAKAI - 02 SAKURAI - 03 KISHI

01:20.247 --> 01:22.082
There's still a long road ahead of us,

01:22.666 --> 01:26.378
but it'll feel that much more satisfying
when we finally accomplish our goal.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.047
So, let's enjoy it.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.893
<i>Close combat</i>
<i>I'm slashing</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:46.940
<i>You who are standing in front of me</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:52.988 --> 01:54.156
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

01:54.239 --> 01:59.328
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

01:59.411 --> 02:03.248
<i>Shout it out</i>
<i>And refuse ambiguity</i>

02:03.790 --> 02:07.252
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

02:07.336 --> 02:09.963
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

02:10.047 --> 02:13.216
<i>On or off</i>
<i>Which one is it now?</i>

02:14.384 --> 02:18.597
<i>Ending up killing emotions</i>
<i>Over and over</i>

02:18.680 --> 02:24.102
<i>No, I was just slipping through</i>
<i>Being destroyed, that's all</i>

02:25.062 --> 02:27.356
<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>Craze</i>

02:27.439 --> 02:31.109
<i>I am I</i>
<i>Even if I am cornered</i>

02:31.193 --> 02:32.861
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

02:32.944 --> 02:35.280
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

02:35.364 --> 02:37.866
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

02:37.949 --> 02:42.996
<i>Reveal your true self, your instincts</i>
<i>Time to strike back</i>

02:43.080 --> 02:45.290
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>So I slashed</i>

02:45.374 --> 02:48.001
<i>Who are you?</i>

03:01.556 --> 03:06.478
BUT I'M ALWAYS SCARED

03:18.615 --> 03:19.491
Mr. Ogura.

03:20.992 --> 03:24.996
I'm not giving you any cigarettes.
These are my telomeres.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.292
Your cigarettes... are the end sequences
of chromosomes?

03:29.376 --> 03:30.836
You know a lot, huh?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.339
Yeah well,
I was trying for medical school.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.759
You mean rascal school? Have one.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.097
I didn't come here to bum a cigarette.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.224
Okay, then what do you want?

03:52.691 --> 03:54.025
I see.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.573
So, that's the reason
you've been avoiding summoning it, huh?

04:00.824 --> 04:04.953
Have you ever heard the saying,
"Only a coward is afraid of his own dog"?

04:07.414 --> 04:11.126
There's no use to keep on summoning it,
not if I can't control it.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.211
What's causing this anyway?

04:21.553 --> 04:25.223
A little boy called his neighbor
a fat old hag.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.517
But he's not a bad kid.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.937
He was just simply repeating
what his mom said all the time.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.398
As we can see from the example
of that Ajin in Iowa,

04:33.815 --> 04:38.445
an IBM's independent actions
are based on its owner's disposition.

04:39.196 --> 04:42.240
For example, let's say you hated people.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.952
It might cause your IBM
to behave violently.

04:47.412 --> 04:51.541
If you want to change your IBM...
you have to change yourself.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.712
People don't change that easily.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.088
Maybe not.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.466
Nagai.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.344
Mr. Tosaki wants to see you.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.095
Okay.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.060
<i>What's with this creep?</i>

05:13.438 --> 05:16.900
04 WAKAZAKI - 05 KAI - 06 YI
07 TADOKORO

05:16.983 --> 05:18.193
There are 13 people left.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.279
The enemy will definitely show up
near one of them.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.824
So, our best bet is to set up an ambush.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.827
The question is
who to set the ambush around.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.954
Why not the next on the list,
that Kishi guy?

05:29.037 --> 05:31.039
We don't want any more people killed,
right?

05:31.122 --> 05:34.084
No good.
Dr. Kishi's already gone into hiding,

05:34.167 --> 05:35.877
with a heavy security detail.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.838
Even I haven't been told where he is.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.133
If only you were on the list,
we could've used you as bait.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.385
Shut up, Nagai.

05:44.094 --> 05:47.347
Anyway... right now,
there's only one person who'll do.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.767
Right. The only one who fits
all our conditions...

05:51.643 --> 05:53.186
is target number 14.

05:54.271 --> 05:56.189
The Minister
of Health, Labor and Welfare.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.025
You're just leaving
those other people to die?!

05:59.568 --> 06:02.237
All of the targets are currently under
massive police protection,

06:02.821 --> 06:05.240
and we don't know when or where
they'll be attacked.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.242
There's nothing we can do.

06:10.412 --> 06:13.748
But Mr. Tosaki can get access
to the minister's schedule,

06:14.332 --> 06:18.420
and if we have that, we might be able
to guess the time and place of the attack.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.880
Also, we might learn Sato's patterns

06:20.964 --> 06:23.341
before it is the minister's turn
to be assassinated.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.678
Right. And then I'll work out
some kind of a plan

06:26.928 --> 06:30.056
in order for us to be able
to join the fight without any issues.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.893
I have compiled some possible places
where the attack might occur

06:33.977 --> 06:35.270
based on what we have now.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.107
So, we'll prepare a specific strategy
for each of those places.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.527
The remaining question is,
how do we fight him?

06:43.111 --> 06:44.279
We have three Ajin.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.531
The enemy has us beat in numbers,

06:46.615 --> 06:49.534
but if we prepare,
we should have what we need.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.912
Three? You can't count Ms. Shimomura!

06:55.248 --> 06:58.668
-What's wrong with her?
-We can't put a woman in danger!

07:00.629 --> 07:03.006
This isn't like an athletic competition.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.259
Young, sick, or old, we'll use who we can.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.385
Now, look!

07:07.469 --> 07:10.055
Nakano, that's sweet of you,
but cut it out.

07:10.138 --> 07:12.557
I have no intention
of skipping out on my duty.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.853
Of course not.

07:23.318 --> 07:25.403
Okay, let's take a break for now.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.031
I have some e-mails I need to answer.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.242
How can you be so relaxed, Mr. Tozaki?

07:31.326 --> 07:33.286
Rushing things will only lead to mistakes.

07:33.745 --> 07:37.374
Sato won't be able to find Dr. Kishi
as easily as he thinks.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.002
And one more thing, Nakano.

07:42.045 --> 07:45.382
My name is Tosaki. Get it right already.

07:50.887 --> 07:51.972
Well...

07:56.476 --> 07:58.937
<i>Hey, what do you mean, "it's impossible"?</i>

07:59.020 --> 08:02.816
You said you'd be able to do anything
as long as you had that thing.

08:02.899 --> 08:07.445
As a general rule, there are some things
that can be done and some that can't.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.490
So, any progress?

08:11.032 --> 08:15.370
I'm at a loss. I searched the servers of
the Control Commission and the Ministry,

08:15.453 --> 08:16.579
but I got nothing.

08:17.122 --> 08:21.960
So, why not skip Kishi
and take care of Keita Iwazaki next?

08:22.794 --> 08:24.004
That's not going to work.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.090
I've decided
we're going in order this time.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.301
We have to follow the rules,
just like in a game.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.763
But if we have no idea where he is,
then we're stuck.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.934
Well, all games have their cheats, right?

08:38.435 --> 08:40.228
If we don't know where Kishi is,

08:40.854 --> 08:43.690
we find out where the men
assigned to protect him are.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.694
So, just hack
the Metropolitan Police Department.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.571
Isn't that impossible?

08:49.654 --> 08:52.282
No, that's one of the things
that can be done.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.952
Naturally, it'll take a few days
since we're starting from scratch,

08:56.036 --> 08:58.079
but just like with the Ministry,

08:58.163 --> 09:01.249
the Metro P.D. server
should have a back door.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.335
So, all I have to do is borrow that.
So, if I can just find it...

09:04.419 --> 09:05.545
What's he talking about?

09:05.628 --> 09:08.840
I'll sneak in that back door,
and close it behind me when I leave...

09:08.923 --> 09:11.384
Basically... he's using a cheat.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.515
YUJI KISHI

09:19.017 --> 09:19.934
It's done.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.146
Security assigned for Yuji Kishi.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.273
There are two units of riot police,

09:25.356 --> 09:28.860
as well as people drummed up from Traffic
and Community Safety Divisions.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.655
I guess they can't afford to be too picky
when it comes to choosing personnel.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.449
Where are they?

09:37.327 --> 09:38.536
In the mountains.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.215
Why don't you try to settle down a bit?

09:50.799 --> 09:52.300
You won't last long like that.

09:54.469 --> 09:55.887
Yes, you're right.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.437
Who's there?!

10:10.944 --> 10:11.778
A ghost.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.761
There are two ways to get rid of an IBM.

10:37.470 --> 10:42.517
Wait for it to disappear,
or have another IBM hit it in the head.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.025
If two IBMs collide with each other,

10:51.109 --> 10:54.529
particles bearing different information
get mixed together.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.782
Basically, their wires get crossed.

10:58.783 --> 11:02.287
Communication between particles
that should be re-bonding is suspended,

11:02.662 --> 11:05.540
and as a result, they are neutralized.

11:08.376 --> 11:10.962
Turn off your phone during class,
four-eyes.

11:11.045 --> 11:11.921
This is Tosaki.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.549
What's that?

11:15.425 --> 11:16.426
How did they find out?

11:18.970 --> 11:23.141
Yeah, I leave that to you.
I'll head back immediately.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.185
Is it Dr. Kishi?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.688
Yeah, they got him.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.901
Just when they'd increased security,
he was assassinated by an IBM.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.319
Damn it.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.237
How did they locate him?

11:36.571 --> 11:37.447
We don't know.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.702
If we don't know how they found out,
it doesn't matter where the targets hide.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.537
We can't stall for time.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.041
And that means
that we've lost one of our advantages.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.211
And you...

11:53.171 --> 11:56.424
I hear you've been slacking
on your IBM training lately.

11:57.926 --> 12:01.262
Our greatest strength is your IBM.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.016
You better master using it ASAP.
Do you understand?

12:13.483 --> 12:17.362
I guess it looks like
you are this team's telomere.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.408
WARNING: MOUNTAIN FIRES

12:22.492 --> 12:23.993
NO FIRES ALLOWED

12:24.077 --> 12:25.578
The enemy will be armed.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.706
At the very least, you should learn
how to use weapons like these.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.504
First try holding it, and then--

12:44.722 --> 12:47.058
I like how machines do as they're told.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.062
There's no rapid-fire button?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.815
Shut up and just watch first.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.532
It's not working.

13:03.032 --> 13:03.866
Hand it over.

13:05.910 --> 13:06.744
Here.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.037
Thanks.

13:13.543 --> 13:15.962
You fool! Why did you let go?

13:16.629 --> 13:17.672
My hand hurts.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.465
Are you a girl?

13:19.882 --> 13:23.094
Whatever. What hurts, hurts!

13:32.061 --> 13:33.604
Excuse--

13:35.606 --> 13:38.359
Oh, Nagai. You need something?

13:41.154 --> 13:42.030
No.

13:43.281 --> 13:44.991
Never mind. It can wait.

13:56.461 --> 13:59.630
Manabe was saying that
he thought you needed something.

14:01.299 --> 14:05.136
I just thought it'd be useful to have data
like everyone's height and weight.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.388
But I can do just fine without it.

14:07.889 --> 14:08.848
Okay, then.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.269
Are you...? Are you lonely?

14:14.896 --> 14:15.855
I guess not.

14:17.398 --> 14:20.109
Then... maybe you're just lost.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.909
You're wondering if your
unsympathetic behavior is appropriate,

14:27.992 --> 14:33.081
and you're also wondering if maybe
you should... somehow try and change.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.417
-Is that right?
-No!

14:38.419 --> 14:41.714
Look, I haven't said a single thing
that doesn't make sense.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.050
I'm making entirely logical decisions.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.677
What is it that you think
I need to change?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.973
Yes... you're exactly right.

14:51.849 --> 14:52.850
What?

14:54.018 --> 14:57.688
That Nakano kid is good at gaining
other people's trust.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.608
If you were in the same class at school,

15:01.192 --> 15:03.611
he'd be the popular kid
and you'd just be some loser.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.614
But this isn't school.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.661
We're going to need to make decisions
that go beyond morals or emotions.

15:13.079 --> 15:17.542
And you're... You're able to do that.

15:21.212 --> 15:23.047
I know all that.

15:23.965 --> 15:24.799
I see.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.677
I must have misunderstood.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.767
My father was an excellent surgeon.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.354
He was close with his patients.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.357
After they recovered,
they'd send him letters every year.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.652
But that was also his greatest weakness.

15:45.695 --> 15:48.656
When I was 9, one of his patients
couldn't find a kidney donor,

15:48.739 --> 15:52.452
and my father tried to help by getting
involved in black-market organ trading.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.538
In the end, my father lost everything.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.500
I won't make the same mistake.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.794
I'm not an idiot.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.798
There's no seniority
when it comes to intelligence.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.009
Do as you will.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.679
Our job is to simply follow
whatever the plan asks of us.

16:19.937 --> 16:24.358
I have a list of the most important points
of our Sato countermeasure strategies.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.777
I expect you all to memorize them.

16:27.820 --> 16:28.654
Nakano.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.239
You especially.

16:31.699 --> 16:32.742
What does this say?

16:34.660 --> 16:35.620
"Invasion."

16:38.956 --> 16:39.832
Hey.

16:40.416 --> 16:43.503
You expect us to do this?
We're not Ajin, you know.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.172
Nagai, this was your idea, wasn't it?

16:47.381 --> 16:48.299
Yeah, so?

16:51.886 --> 16:53.179
Looks like it'll be fun.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.317
Hey.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.403
What do you want?

17:10.238 --> 17:11.072
Do you--?

17:12.698 --> 17:14.408
Well, do you know a good way to die?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.662
Well, the professor told me...

17:18.788 --> 17:21.290
Whether or not your IBM manifests
is basically luck.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.045
An Ajin's IBM particles
are at their densest when they regenerate.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.383
However, unusual effects can occur
during that time.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.385
You could call it a tunnel effect.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.178
What tunnel do I need to go to?

17:38.015 --> 17:40.476
You'll be going to the great beyond.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.356
If you want to force your IBM to manifest,
there's just one thing to do.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.234
And that's dying over and over again.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.946
I've already died an awful lot.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.490
Might take a couple tries,
or a few hundred,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.701
if you want to win that trip to Hawaii.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.334
With this,
you can keep dying automatically.

18:05.668 --> 18:06.877
Even sleep through it.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.963
And there won't be any pain.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.348
Okay then. I'm ready.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.142
What's there to be afraid of?

18:22.018 --> 18:24.437
Well, how do you
just let yourself die like that?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.063
You do it, too, don't you?

18:26.355 --> 18:27.481
But I'm always scared.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.443
I mean, you never know, right?

18:31.152 --> 18:32.945
Maybe the next time I won't come back.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.950
It's just a rumor,
but I've heard that an Ajin in China

18:38.492 --> 18:40.703
has set a record by dying 2,000 times.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.663
And the count is still rising.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.249
Wow, they sure go all out.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.503
Whatever it takes...
or else we'll never move forward.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.173
There's nothing to be afraid of.

18:53.424 --> 18:56.052
You're pretty amazing.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.930
Just hurry up and die.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.352
Hey, are you leaving?

19:04.435 --> 19:07.313
What, are you a child? I'm busy.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.440
Oh, that's cold, man.

19:26.290 --> 19:30.044
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>There's nothing to be afraid of.</i>

19:49.271 --> 19:50.606
Do what you want!

19:57.446 --> 20:00.741
I'm not ordering you around anymore.
Do what you like.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.498
I know that.

20:08.290 --> 20:10.334
I'm not an idiot.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.049
Man, I'm surrounded by idiots.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.392
-Serves you right.
-Why you...

20:45.286 --> 20:48.831
-There are plenty of other seats--
-That friend of yours is in juvenile hall.

20:50.791 --> 20:51.709
That day...

20:53.377 --> 20:54.962
<i>The day you were sent to the lab.</i>

20:58.007 --> 21:00.176
The police went ahead and arrested him.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.848
Why are you telling me this now?

21:11.437 --> 21:13.647
Are you planning to use Kaito
to threaten me...

21:14.940 --> 21:16.734
just in case I were to betray you?

21:17.234 --> 21:19.987
Oh, do you mean the same way
you used my fiancée?

21:22.656 --> 21:25.117
A winning hand's only good
when you keep your cards hidden.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.537
But I thought you didn't need him anymore.
Isn't that right?

21:30.998 --> 21:34.251
I just figured
it wasn't a winning hand anymore.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.549
Also, don't eat this crap
when you're trying to lose weight.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.386
What a jerk.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.767
<i>Juvenile hall, huh?</i>

21:51.685 --> 21:53.479
<i>I guess I screwed Kai over pretty bad.</i>

21:54.939 --> 21:58.192
<i>But... when I think of</i>
<i>what we'll be doing...</i>

22:00.736 --> 22:02.780
<i>that may be the safest place for him.</i>

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
From today on,
you'll be in this group dorm.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.313
TO BE CONTINUED

22:37.481 --> 22:40.526
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

22:40.609 --> 22:43.821
<i>I'll trade it</i>

22:43.904 --> 22:49.118
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

22:50.160 --> 22:56.292
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

22:56.667 --> 23:01.755
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

23:02.840 --> 23:07.136
<i>You can see them all</i>

23:09.430 --> 23:13.350
<i>When you come to my house</i>

23:13.892 --> 23:19.982
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

23:20.065 --> 23:22.192
<i>While the wind blows</i>

23:22.276 --> 23:27.531
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

23:28.574 --> 23:34.913
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

23:34.997 --> 23:41.295
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

23:41.378 --> 23:47.259
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

23:47.843 --> 23:50.554
<i>"Be my friend</i>

23:50.638 --> 23:57.436
<i>Always"</i>
