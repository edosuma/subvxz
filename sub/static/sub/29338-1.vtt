00:18.535 --> 00:21.297
Ernie, say something!

00:29.719 --> 00:31.238
God damn it, it's low.

00:31.272 --> 00:32.066
Keep filming.

00:32.101 --> 00:33.757
Keep rolling till
it fucking dies.

00:33.792 --> 00:35.828
The police need to
see everything.

00:40.695 --> 00:42.007
Nate?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.491
Oh, my God.

00:43.526 --> 00:44.699
Shit.

00:54.744 --> 00:56.987
What the fuck happened to you?

00:59.404 --> 01:00.439
Ernie.

01:00.474 --> 01:02.165
We need to help Ernie.

01:03.132 --> 01:04.616
Jerod, let's go.

01:11.278 --> 01:13.073
He's not moving.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.764
Fuck, guys.

01:21.943 --> 01:22.943
Ernie?

01:37.718 --> 01:39.202
Can you do this?

01:42.481 --> 01:44.207
Let's go, let's go.

01:44.242 --> 01:45.484
Come on, come on.

01:51.352 --> 01:52.457
Oh, shit.

01:52.491 --> 01:53.906
Oh shit, oh shit!

04:00.999 --> 04:02.345
I don't know anything.

04:02.380 --> 04:03.657
I don't wanna talk to you.

04:22.986 --> 04:24.919
Good morning, ladies and
gentleman.

04:24.954 --> 04:26.611
The footage you're about to see

04:26.645 --> 04:28.647
was found somewhere in the
Everglades.

04:29.855 --> 04:34.066
It appears to be the Black
Grove Psychiatric Asylum.

04:35.378 --> 04:37.967
If after the screening
you have any questions,

04:38.001 --> 04:39.382
I'll be in my office.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.558
Your assignment's
on the wall outside.

04:44.422 --> 04:46.044
Mel, can I see you?

04:54.224 --> 04:55.778
- Look Professor I'm...
- I think this

04:55.812 --> 04:57.297
is what you were waiting for.

05:00.092 --> 05:01.646
Thank you, Professor.

05:35.162 --> 05:37.716
What the fuck?

05:37.751 --> 05:38.821
What is that?

05:46.415 --> 05:48.071
Oh, you've got to be fucking
kidding me.

06:34.255 --> 06:36.188
This footage was taken six
years ago

06:36.223 --> 06:39.053
by viral video blogger
Brian Resner.

06:39.088 --> 06:41.539
It instantly catapulted
him to phenom status.

06:41.573 --> 06:44.265
Sadly, this was the last
video he'd ever make.

06:44.300 --> 06:45.266
What authorities searched

06:45.301 --> 06:47.096
for possible clues they found
nothing on...

06:47.130 --> 06:48.373
Guys, we got it.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.616
We fucking got it.

06:49.650 --> 06:51.859
- No way, dude.
- Fuck yeah!

06:51.894 --> 06:53.171
We got one night.

07:07.116 --> 07:08.116
All right, guys.

07:09.394 --> 07:10.394
Let's get movin'.

07:14.572 --> 07:15.400
Everything okay?

07:15.435 --> 07:16.435
- Yeah.
- Good.

07:17.885 --> 07:18.990
All right everybody.

07:19.818 --> 07:22.511
This here is our golden ticket.

07:23.581 --> 07:25.490
This is the date in which
we're gonna be presenting our

07:25.514 --> 07:27.619
findings to the committee
at the university.

07:27.654 --> 07:30.001
And, cement our
names in history.

07:30.035 --> 07:32.037
We're gonna change
science forever.

07:32.072 --> 07:35.144
Now, just for the
sake of record keeping,

07:35.178 --> 07:37.284
let's backtrack a bit
and fill everyone in

07:37.318 --> 07:39.528
on what we've been
trying to do here.

07:39.562 --> 07:42.496
There are so many bloggers
and wannabes that are trying

07:42.531 --> 07:45.672
to prove that ghosts exist,
but they have no legitimate

07:45.706 --> 07:48.571
scientific evidence to
backup any of their claims.

07:48.606 --> 07:49.652
I mean, have you ever looked

07:49.676 --> 07:52.851
at the footage and asked
yourself, is this real?

07:52.886 --> 07:55.440
And if it is, is it even
possible?

07:56.924 --> 07:58.926
My uncle used to always
say to me,

07:58.961 --> 08:00.963
the proof is in the
pudding, Mel.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.378
Well you know what?

08:02.412 --> 08:05.519
This group knows their shit
when it comes to science.

08:05.554 --> 08:08.177
So we have done previous
investigations,

08:08.211 --> 08:10.904
but for now let's just
call it Investigation 13.

08:13.941 --> 08:17.255
We can in fact scientifically
prove that spirits actually

08:17.289 --> 08:20.603
exist and we can even
explain how this happens.

08:20.638 --> 08:22.191
But I'm not gonna go into detail

08:22.225 --> 08:24.918
until we present everything
to the school board.

08:24.952 --> 08:29.957
Which is to start the very first
parapsychology course ever.

08:30.786 --> 08:32.890
I mean, this could literally
revolutionize

08:32.926 --> 08:36.376
the way we view ourselves
and those on the other side.

08:36.412 --> 08:38.587
Now, this is all with the
basic intention of answering

08:38.621 --> 08:41.727
the few questions like why are
they here?

08:41.761 --> 08:43.177
Where do they go?

08:43.212 --> 08:45.766
And even, what do they want?

08:45.801 --> 08:48.942
I mean, our bodies can literally
be nothing but vessels.

08:48.976 --> 08:50.599
Do you have any idea
what that means?

08:50.633 --> 08:52.715
Yeah, we might be able to
figure out how to transfer

08:52.739 --> 08:54.741
our souls or spirits or what
have you,

08:54.775 --> 08:58.227
and experience the entire
universe at the speed of light.

08:58.261 --> 09:00.332
It's literally life after death.

09:00.367 --> 09:02.127
Now, it goes without saying

09:02.162 --> 09:04.060
that this is the very first
step.

09:04.095 --> 09:06.407
I mean, we have a lot of
research to do.

09:06.442 --> 09:09.065
But this can very much
inspire the youth of today

09:09.100 --> 09:11.689
and tomorrow to do
something big.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.898
This can change
our entire world.

09:13.932 --> 09:16.659
And we are pioneers
of that change.

09:16.694 --> 09:19.524
So anyway, let's not
be camera hogs here.

09:19.559 --> 09:20.708
This isn't about Jerod and I,

09:20.732 --> 09:23.321
even if Jerod would like
it to be all about him.

09:23.355 --> 09:24.184
Hey.

09:24.218 --> 09:25.610
Over on the west side
of the room,

09:25.634 --> 09:28.947
compiling our footage is Terry.

09:30.328 --> 09:32.675
And behind the camera is...

09:32.710 --> 09:33.607
What are you doing?

09:33.642 --> 09:35.091
Good ole' Nate.

09:35.126 --> 09:37.646
Come on, Mel, you know I'm
camera shy.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.750
Oh, relax.

09:40.131 --> 09:41.131
Ba ba booey.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.481
Yes, sounds great.

09:45.515 --> 09:46.555
We'll see you on Saturday.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.656
Thank you so much.

09:50.555 --> 09:52.695
Guys, we're in.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.504
Stay away from me.

10:08.538 --> 10:09.538
I mean it.

10:11.749 --> 10:13.405
Time for lunch.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.644
What?

10:46.335 --> 10:47.819
I know what you did.

10:47.854 --> 10:49.338
Leave me be, mister.

10:49.372 --> 10:53.514
You're the kid
who mommy and daddy.

10:53.549 --> 10:54.861
And I thought I was nuts.

10:54.895 --> 10:55.931
I'm not crazy.

10:55.965 --> 10:57.967
Nah, of course not.

10:58.002 --> 10:59.175
None of us are.

11:01.143 --> 11:03.732
Stop it.

11:03.766 --> 11:05.043
Stop laughing.

11:19.955 --> 11:20.955
Silence.

11:22.509 --> 11:24.511
Take him to the infirmary.

11:25.512 --> 11:28.308
As for you, you're coming
with me.

11:31.518 --> 11:32.795
Let go of me.

11:32.830 --> 11:33.830
Let go!

11:39.319 --> 11:40.734
What is that?

11:40.769 --> 11:42.184
What are you gonna do to me?

11:42.218 --> 11:44.531
Settle down now, Mr. Craven.

11:44.565 --> 11:47.327
I'm just going to perform a
procedure

11:47.361 --> 11:49.087
to help you calm down a bit.

11:54.886 --> 11:56.232
Three, two, one.

12:03.343 --> 12:06.760
Three, two, one.

12:10.833 --> 12:14.285
Third time's a charm,
Mr. Craven.

12:14.319 --> 12:16.632
Three, two, one.

12:50.183 --> 12:52.875
Why are the lights off in here?

12:52.910 --> 12:54.083
He likes the dark.

12:54.118 --> 12:55.395
He's like a mole.

12:57.742 --> 13:00.814
I want the bulbs
replaced in here at once.

13:00.849 --> 13:01.849
Yes, ma'am.

13:05.439 --> 13:07.131
You poor thing.

13:08.270 --> 13:10.030
I'm not going to hurt you.

13:10.065 --> 13:11.687
That's not a good idea, ma'am.

13:11.721 --> 13:14.000
He's not some animal.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.933
Get him washed up.

13:20.006 --> 13:22.077
How are you feeling, Mr. Craven?

13:26.875 --> 13:28.497
Give us some privacy.

13:28.531 --> 13:30.844
Ma'am, I strongly
advise against it.

13:30.879 --> 13:32.259
I'll be fine.

13:32.294 --> 13:34.675
You can stay right outside the
doors.

13:40.095 --> 13:42.407
Seems like it's just you and me.

13:44.168 --> 13:45.617
You like it?

13:45.652 --> 13:50.519
It's a dream catcher; Filters
out all the bad dreams.

13:50.553 --> 13:53.522
I love the Native American
culture.

13:53.556 --> 13:54.556
How about you?

13:57.077 --> 14:00.253
No worries, after what the
previous administration

14:00.287 --> 14:04.188
put you through, I wouldn't
blame you for not trusting me.

14:04.222 --> 14:05.741
Now that I'm in charge,

14:05.775 --> 14:08.295
we're going to do things
differently around here.

14:20.376 --> 14:23.793
I don't know, after
reviewing his past behavior,

14:23.828 --> 14:27.280
I don't think it's wise to let
him have this much exposure.

14:27.314 --> 14:28.937
He can't be rehabilitated

14:28.971 --> 14:32.457
if he's kept in that
dark cage 24/7.

14:32.492 --> 14:34.080
That cage is a reminder

14:34.114 --> 14:35.875
of who the crazy ones are.

14:35.909 --> 14:36.703
Don't forget it.

14:36.737 --> 14:38.222
And it doesn't take much

14:38.256 --> 14:40.086
for us to be in there with them.

14:41.742 --> 14:44.814
I haven't seen
it happen just after sunset.

14:44.849 --> 14:46.023
My friend got scalped.

14:46.057 --> 14:48.266
Scalped, scalped, he didn't
have a single pound left,

14:48.301 --> 14:49.923
scalped, scalped,
he didn't know stop,

14:49.958 --> 14:52.892
scalped, scalped,
scalped, scalped,

14:52.926 --> 14:54.790
scalped, scalped,
scalped, scalped,

14:54.824 --> 14:57.758
scalped, scalped,
scalped, scalped.

15:16.639 --> 15:19.263
We're finally awake, Mr. Craven.

15:19.297 --> 15:22.369
Please, please no shock.

15:22.404 --> 15:24.613
I'm not going
to shock you, sweetie.

15:24.647 --> 15:26.511
That treatment is barbaric.

15:26.546 --> 15:28.099
It's ineffective.

15:28.134 --> 15:29.721
What are you
going to do to me, then?

15:29.756 --> 15:32.655
Are you familiar
with the ways of the shaman?

15:34.347 --> 15:37.384
They're known as healers,
able to communicate with

15:37.419 --> 15:40.249
the spirit realm and other
dimensions.

15:40.284 --> 15:43.321
I've traveled the world
and learned of their ways,

15:43.356 --> 15:45.565
and I'm here to free you.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.118
From what?

15:47.153 --> 15:50.984
The evil that
is deep inside you.

15:51.019 --> 15:53.124
I know you're not evil, Leonard.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.438
You want me to help you,
Leonard?

15:57.439 --> 15:59.751
Very well, let's begin.

17:30.394 --> 17:31.981
Start shooting as
soon as we get out.

17:32.016 --> 17:33.016
Film everything.

17:42.026 --> 17:44.201
Investigation 13
takes place here,

17:44.235 --> 17:47.238
at the legendary Black
Grove Psychiatric Asylum.

17:47.273 --> 17:48.733
We're about to meet the
building's owner,

17:48.757 --> 17:50.310
Miss Layla Parrish.

17:50.345 --> 17:51.691
Hi, Jerod.

17:51.725 --> 17:52.657
Nice to meet you.

17:52.692 --> 17:54.280
Nice to meet you.

17:54.314 --> 17:55.522
What's with the camera.

17:55.557 --> 17:58.663
Oh, we just use it to document
every single step to prove

17:58.698 --> 18:01.390
we're not manipulating the
environment in any way.

18:01.425 --> 18:02.736
I mentioned it in the email,

18:02.771 --> 18:04.152
along with doing a brief
interview.

18:04.186 --> 18:05.498
Oh, yeah.

18:07.465 --> 18:09.674
Cool, well again,
I'd like to thank you

18:09.709 --> 18:11.435
for providing us
with this opportunity.

18:11.469 --> 18:13.816
Now, no one's been given
access to the inside

18:13.851 --> 18:15.128
in over five years, correct?

18:15.163 --> 18:16.923
That's right, mm hm, mm hm.

18:16.957 --> 18:20.375
Except for the occasional
ones who sneak in here.

18:21.376 --> 18:22.687
And no bodies have been found?

18:22.722 --> 18:24.172
Or no sounds of foul play?

18:24.206 --> 18:25.414
No.

18:25.449 --> 18:28.245
So, how many people have
disappeared from the premises?

18:30.039 --> 18:33.250
Do you mind if we just, talk
off the record a little bit?

18:34.527 --> 18:36.529
- Okay.
- No cameras.

18:38.255 --> 18:40.084
Sure, shut it off.

18:41.361 --> 18:42.361
It's off.

18:43.570 --> 18:44.570
What's wrong?

18:45.641 --> 18:50.646
Now, before we go any
further with this interview,

18:52.407 --> 18:54.512
I just wanted to let y'all know,

18:56.376 --> 19:01.243
I'm not the kinda girl
to believes in ghosts.

19:02.658 --> 19:04.936
And I sure as hell don't
get scared

19:04.971 --> 19:07.111
when things go bump
in the night.

19:08.699 --> 19:11.943
This place has been combed
over by the authorities

19:11.978 --> 19:15.395
and aside from a few rodents,
which have a made a home,

19:15.430 --> 19:20.193
and a whole lot of dust,
it's empty.

19:23.231 --> 19:25.129
So, we have nothing
to worry about?

19:26.130 --> 19:30.099
Look, I just need the money.

19:31.066 --> 19:32.861
Did you bring the 750?

19:32.895 --> 19:33.896
Of course.

19:38.384 --> 19:39.592
Well, all righty then.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.460
Isn't this the entrance?

19:48.359 --> 19:52.121
Those doors are sealed
permanently, from the inside.

19:55.332 --> 19:57.368
There's only one way in.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.246
This way.

20:31.713 --> 20:33.853
Well, as you can see
due to old wiring

20:33.887 --> 20:37.374
some parts of this
building have no power.

20:37.408 --> 20:42.344
Oh, this facility has
definitely seen better days.

20:43.207 --> 20:44.357
I understand you're pretty
knowledgeable

20:44.381 --> 20:45.830
about the building's history?

20:49.006 --> 20:53.286
Well, my great
grandfather, Leon Parrish,

20:54.149 --> 20:57.256
he was one of the
main original investors.

20:57.290 --> 21:01.121
And eventually, that's how I
came to be

21:01.156 --> 21:03.779
the proud owner of this
nightmare building.

21:11.339 --> 21:16.171
The Black Grove Psychiatric
Asylum began operation

21:16.205 --> 21:21.245
in the late 1800s and
was originally called

21:21.280 --> 21:23.765
the Black Grove Lunatic Asylum,

21:23.799 --> 21:27.907
but some time around oh
1915 the word lunatic

21:27.941 --> 21:29.460
was deemed politically
incorrect,

21:29.495 --> 21:31.876
so the name was changed to

21:31.911 --> 21:36.191
the Black Grove
Psychiatric Asylum.

21:36.225 --> 21:39.505
But, most people still refer
to it as a lunatic asylum.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.784
Still to this day.

21:42.818 --> 21:44.303
So, what could you tell us about

21:44.337 --> 21:46.028
those early years at the asylum?

21:47.064 --> 21:51.896
Well as I understand
when it opened it measured

21:51.931 --> 21:54.209
just over 200,000 square feet

21:55.866 --> 22:00.871
and was originally built
to house 300 patients.

22:02.907 --> 22:07.878
By 1945 there were well
over 1,600 patients

22:11.364 --> 22:12.538
residing in the wards.

22:13.504 --> 22:14.954
That's nuts.

22:14.988 --> 22:17.059
So, who were the people
that were treated here?

22:17.094 --> 22:19.614
And what kind of methods did
they use?

22:19.648 --> 22:23.963
Well, from its early stages
the asylum housed males

22:23.997 --> 22:28.485
and females who were considered
mentally ill or insane.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.075
Just pleasuring yourself would

22:33.110 --> 22:35.492
get you put behind these walls.

22:37.666 --> 22:42.326
Hell, it was the number one
listed cause of insanity.

22:46.882 --> 22:51.887
In its hay day, it was a
common place for doctors here

22:52.543 --> 22:57.134
to perform lobotomies and
to use electro shock therapy

22:57.168 --> 22:58.377
to treat their patients.

23:02.588 --> 23:03.830
Over the years...

23:06.177 --> 23:10.837
A number of deaths
occurred within the asylum.

23:10.872 --> 23:13.633
Documented to be
in the hundreds.

23:17.050 --> 23:18.845
Have you ever
noticed any of those

23:18.880 --> 23:21.779
tragic souls roaming this
building, Miss Parrish?

23:21.814 --> 23:24.333
No, now I'd like to show you all

23:24.368 --> 23:26.543
where you'll be setting
up your equipment.

23:29.477 --> 23:30.650
This is perfect.

23:31.858 --> 23:35.414
Yeah, I thought it would
work well for you all.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.047
Terry, why don't you stay
here and start setting up

23:38.071 --> 23:40.280
while Layla gives us
the rest of the tour.

23:40.315 --> 23:41.534
- All right.
- I got my walkie on

23:41.558 --> 23:42.628
if you need anything.

23:45.631 --> 23:46.631
Well, Miss Parrish?

23:50.221 --> 23:51.568
We saved the best for last.

23:55.572 --> 23:58.160
This is where they kept all
the most

23:58.195 --> 24:00.266
violent and unstable patients.

24:01.750 --> 24:06.755
Some of the most horrific
incidents occurred on this floor.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.243
Whoa, this place is incredible.

24:12.278 --> 24:14.970
You want Melanie to
hold you hand, Nate?

24:15.005 --> 24:16.178
Shut up, Jerod.

24:20.286 --> 24:23.151
Would this place still be
open if it wasn't for Craven?

24:24.083 --> 24:28.708
Within 15 years of its closing,
things grew more violent.

24:29.882 --> 24:34.024
Financial problems,
lack of staffing,

24:35.991 --> 24:40.996
gave way to abuse
of the patients.

24:42.377 --> 24:43.758
There were physical attacks,

24:46.208 --> 24:51.213
even murder between
patients and staff.

24:58.358 --> 24:59.358
But indeed...

25:03.502 --> 25:07.022
Leonard Craven was
the last straw.

25:09.542 --> 25:12.027
Can you tell us about
the legend of the Mole Man?

25:16.722 --> 25:19.207
Why don't I show you instead?

25:22.590 --> 25:27.595
This here cell, number 363
was Leonard Craven's home.

25:33.877 --> 25:34.877
After you.

25:39.296 --> 25:40.504
Fine.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.850
Grow a pair, boys.

25:51.619 --> 25:55.243
The atmosphere in this
room feels different.

25:57.314 --> 25:58.394
We need to setup and
IR camera in here

25:58.418 --> 26:01.180
and I think we should put
one out in the hallway.

26:01.214 --> 26:03.182
Why was Craven
sent to this place?

26:04.563 --> 26:08.739
His parents were drug
addicts and physically

26:08.774 --> 26:12.122
and sexually molested
him as a child.

26:14.711 --> 26:16.160
He's also thought to be mute.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.785
It was just a matter of
time before he'd sneak

26:19.819 --> 26:24.065
into his parents bedroom
that night, kill 'em both.

26:26.654 --> 26:27.827
Oh, my God.

26:27.862 --> 26:29.588
But, he didn't stop there.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.211
Leonard went on to scalp both

26:32.245 --> 26:34.040
of his parents with
the same knife.

26:35.041 --> 26:36.041
Kept the skins.

26:38.217 --> 26:39.943
Devil incarnate is what he was.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.609
5:08 p.m., interview with Layla.

26:50.643 --> 26:53.266
- You got it?
- Yeah, go for it.

26:53.301 --> 26:54.301
Okay.

26:55.061 --> 26:56.856
We've made our way
from the male ward

26:56.891 --> 26:58.375
and into the boiler room.

26:58.409 --> 27:00.135
It was here where Leonard Craven

27:00.170 --> 27:03.276
made his escape, or so we
believe.

27:03.311 --> 27:06.659
Layla Parrish is about to
show us the point of escape.

27:06.694 --> 27:08.799
Miss Parrish, can you please
tell us about the night

27:08.834 --> 27:11.940
that Leonard Craven
disappeared from Black Grove?

27:11.975 --> 27:14.287
Yeah, from what I'm aware of,

27:14.322 --> 27:19.327
sometime in February of
1976, Leonard managed

27:21.294 --> 27:23.849
to escape from his cell in
the middle of the night.

27:25.574 --> 27:29.164
When Leonard was actually
discovered missing,

27:29.199 --> 27:31.304
the whole building was
searched from top to bottom

27:31.339 --> 27:34.342
and no trace of him could be
found until

27:34.376 --> 27:36.655
a nurse went missing
during her night shift.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.657
Clearly, it was Craven.

27:40.348 --> 27:42.281
Oh, she was always
complaining about her job,

27:42.315 --> 27:44.663
and staff members thought that
she found

27:44.697 --> 27:48.736
the perfect opportunity
to just skip off and quit.

27:48.770 --> 27:52.256
Outsiders speculated that she
was in cahoots with Craven.

27:55.121 --> 28:00.126
Days later, maintenance
workers started complaining

28:00.851 --> 28:05.856
about an awful stench that
filled the whole damn place,

28:06.339 --> 28:11.344
and one of 'em got to looking
around and he traced it,

28:13.070 --> 28:15.555
that smell, to the
ventilation shaft,

28:16.695 --> 28:17.895
where he discovered the nurse.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.118
Craven attacked the worker,

28:26.152 --> 28:30.605
and it's believed Craven
decided to escape through here.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.784
Was Craven's body every found?

28:38.751 --> 28:41.789
Girl, have you ever taken
a look around this place, hm?

28:42.790 --> 28:47.795
No, well, it's filled with
nothing but gators and panthers,

28:50.004 --> 28:53.628
not to mention the land
that's more like grass growing

28:53.662 --> 28:55.837
out of water, making
it damn near impossible

28:55.872 --> 28:57.494
for anyone to travel by foot on.

28:59.151 --> 29:01.947
But this, this was the
same ventilation shaft

29:01.981 --> 29:04.915
where Brian Resner
entered, is that correct?

29:04.950 --> 29:08.125
I'm still involved with
legal matters concerning

29:08.160 --> 29:10.334
the incident with Mr. Resner.

29:10.369 --> 29:14.338
So, I will not comment on any
questions asked about him.

29:15.305 --> 29:18.273
So, the Mole Man, escaped
through here?

29:18.308 --> 29:19.308
Yes.

29:20.068 --> 29:21.518
When they found the body of the
nurse

29:21.552 --> 29:24.901
and the unconscious worker,
they also found that

29:24.935 --> 29:28.939
the grate was removed,
the shaft was open.

29:28.974 --> 29:30.216
Amazing.

29:30.251 --> 29:32.425
Leonard Craven never
even left the grounds.

29:33.426 --> 29:37.914
Well, he might have been crazy,
but he sure wasn't stupid.

29:37.948 --> 29:41.676
But that certainly wasn't the
end of the Mole Man, was it?

29:41.710 --> 29:43.022
No, hun, it wasn't.

29:44.334 --> 29:47.302
It was the end of Leonard Craven

29:47.337 --> 29:51.651
and the birth of this
Mole Man nonsense.

29:53.653 --> 29:56.829
I've done everything that I
can to secure this building.

29:58.106 --> 30:02.766
But until these little
bastards stop breaking in,

30:05.976 --> 30:07.736
this legend will never die.

30:09.566 --> 30:11.154
It's like moths to a flame.

30:12.672 --> 30:13.672
That's right.

30:14.364 --> 30:15.986
Like moths to a flame.

30:19.852 --> 30:22.096
Same thing with legal
nightmares.

30:23.683 --> 30:24.683
Yeah.

30:25.893 --> 30:30.898
They go missing, the lawyers
come after my wrinkly old ass.

30:33.314 --> 30:35.385
Until, Brian Resner.

30:35.419 --> 30:38.284
He has created quagmire
for you, hasn't he?

30:38.319 --> 30:39.423
Enough, Melanie.

30:39.458 --> 30:41.149
She said she can't
talk about him.

30:44.359 --> 30:47.052
So, Miss Parrish,
just for the record,

30:47.086 --> 30:48.329
what is your honest opinion

30:48.363 --> 30:50.193
on the whole Mole Man
phenomenon.

30:53.230 --> 30:55.646
I don't know.

30:55.681 --> 30:59.340
I don't, I don't know
what to make of it all.

31:06.381 --> 31:11.076
I just want to get rid
of this place, for good.

31:15.666 --> 31:17.565
Miss Parrish, that
wraps up the interview.

31:17.599 --> 31:19.679
It may take an hour or two
for us to unload and setup

31:19.705 --> 31:22.190
the rest of our equipment, and
we'll be ready for lockdown.

31:23.226 --> 31:24.744
Oh, fair enough.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.058
You okay?

31:28.093 --> 31:29.232
Yeah, whatever.

31:33.822 --> 31:36.032
Why, why'd you call
me out like that?

31:36.066 --> 31:37.171
What do you mean?

31:37.205 --> 31:39.311
I mean, you've never
treated me like this before.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.118
I'm just keeping things
professional,

31:43.142 --> 31:44.222
isn't that what you wanted?

31:44.247 --> 31:47.181
And calling me out like
that is professional?

31:47.215 --> 31:49.095
I don't have time for
this right now, Melanie.

31:50.115 --> 31:51.771
I'm not surprised.

31:51.806 --> 31:53.532
You never had time before,
anyway.

32:19.247 --> 32:22.112
Well, Miss Parrish, if
you'll kindly do us the honor.

32:22.147 --> 32:23.631
You're sure about this?

32:23.665 --> 32:26.116
We're good, Miss Parrish,
thanks.

32:26.151 --> 32:28.877
Fine then, I'll see you at
7:00 a.m..

32:29.878 --> 32:32.467
Thank you, Miss Parrish.

32:32.502 --> 32:33.952
You're welcome, hun.

32:50.313 --> 32:51.866
I already told you.

32:51.900 --> 32:53.005
You never told me.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.646
I'm taking
you to school, move it.

33:52.099 --> 33:54.791
All right, settle down.

33:54.825 --> 33:56.413
Send your homework to the front.

33:59.209 --> 34:02.074
Leonard, did you do your
homework?

34:02.109 --> 34:03.109
No.

34:06.527 --> 34:08.286
That's enough.

34:08.322 --> 34:09.391
Stay after class.

34:12.291 --> 34:14.811
Turn to page 82 of your
textbook.

34:16.399 --> 34:18.815
We will be covering percentages.

34:24.303 --> 34:28.411
Leonard, I don't know what
to do with you anymore.

34:28.445 --> 34:30.757
You don't turn in your
assignments,

34:30.792 --> 34:35.210
you don't participate,
I'm worried about you.

34:35.245 --> 34:37.385
Should I call your parents in?

34:37.420 --> 34:38.938
No!

34:38.973 --> 34:43.495
Please, don't call my parents.

34:43.529 --> 34:45.600
Is everything fine at home?

34:48.085 --> 34:52.090
I can only help you if
you tell me what is wrong.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.678
I'm okay.

34:55.679 --> 34:59.097
Fine, I need to
see some improvement then.

35:00.028 --> 35:01.028
You're dismissed.

35:04.067 --> 35:07.760
Hey Leonard, is the
teach gonna call your mommy?

35:07.795 --> 35:09.624
Hey, we're talking to you.

35:17.770 --> 35:21.671
Leonard, teach
gonna call your mommy.

35:21.705 --> 35:24.225
Teach gonna call your mommy.

35:25.916 --> 35:27.228
Leonard.

36:38.886 --> 36:40.198
I know this sounds cliche guys,

36:40.232 --> 36:42.648
but if you check your
phone, there's no service.

36:42.683 --> 36:44.236
Damn, I wanted to live Tweet

36:44.271 --> 36:46.065
during the entire investigation.

36:46.100 --> 36:47.250
We can post whatever we need

36:47.274 --> 36:49.241
to on our way back home
tomorrow.

36:49.276 --> 36:50.242
All right.

36:50.277 --> 36:52.589
Does everybody have walkie
talkies?

36:52.624 --> 36:53.418
Good.

36:53.452 --> 36:54.452
Everybody got glasses?

36:55.592 --> 36:56.592
Put 'em on.

36:59.355 --> 37:00.366
All right, now on the first
sweep

37:00.390 --> 37:03.255
I want you and Nate to
cover the second floor.

37:03.290 --> 37:04.330
I'm taking the vibe cam.

37:04.360 --> 37:05.844
Good.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.235
Ernie and I are gonna
cover the third floor

37:07.259 --> 37:09.227
with the mini DV and
the FLIR and as usual,

37:09.261 --> 37:10.997
Terry's gonna stay behind
and watch the monitors

37:11.021 --> 37:12.989
and let us know of any unusual
activity.

37:13.023 --> 37:15.854
Now, we all have walkie
talkies, so stay in contact.

37:17.856 --> 37:20.238
Terry, if for any reason you
decide to get up and start

37:20.272 --> 37:24.311
wandering around, make
sure your glasses are on.

37:24.345 --> 37:26.244
And no video games.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.210
Yes, Dad.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.463
It's gonna be long night guys,

37:28.487 --> 37:31.110
so make sure you fill up on
that OPREME and get to work.

37:33.078 --> 37:35.080
Guys, I'm thirsty, too.

37:46.091 --> 37:48.542
Everything is pretty steady
down there.

37:48.576 --> 37:51.476
So, when we finish up here,

37:51.510 --> 37:54.548
there's a great sushi bar
I'd like to take you to.

37:54.582 --> 37:56.066
You're gonna like this place.

37:56.101 --> 38:00.623
That's perfect, and we can
even do a wrap up party there.

38:00.657 --> 38:01.657
Good idea.

38:02.797 --> 38:03.797
Yeah.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.353
We should do that.

38:06.387 --> 38:09.010
So, let's go to the library
and do an EVP session.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.496
- Lead the way.
- Okay.

38:15.362 --> 38:17.640
It's more hot in here
than it is out there.

38:21.368 --> 38:23.956
We should've filmed at
my dead aunt's place.

38:23.991 --> 38:25.510
Well, unless your aunt was
notorious

38:25.544 --> 38:28.375
for going on killing sprees,
she's of no use to us.

38:28.409 --> 38:30.377
Craven however, is
gonna be the mother load

38:30.411 --> 38:32.413
when it comes to evidence.

38:32.448 --> 38:34.242
Okay, and?

38:35.071 --> 38:38.005
There's not one we've been
able to investigate like him.

38:38.039 --> 38:40.732
I mean, the negative
energy is just 10 times

38:40.766 --> 38:42.527
more powerful than the positive
energy.

38:42.561 --> 38:45.150
Well, you never met my aunt.

38:45.184 --> 38:48.291
Look, as long as we walk outta
here with some proof in the

38:48.326 --> 38:50.914
afterlife and maybe in that
afterlife all we are is balls

38:50.949 --> 38:55.954
of energy, I mean, no Heaven
or Hell, can you imagine that?

38:55.988 --> 38:57.921
The world's gonna be
rocked by that information.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.440
Oh, man.

39:03.513 --> 39:04.790
This is frickin' awesome.

39:06.585 --> 39:08.035
Everything's as cold as ice.

39:09.485 --> 39:11.866
Shit, a frickin' mouse.

39:12.867 --> 39:15.249
Two hours in and all we
got is a fuckin' mouse.

39:23.291 --> 39:26.122
11:33 p.m., library EVP session.

39:42.276 --> 39:46.660
If there's anyone in here,
would you like to talk to us?

39:51.078 --> 39:56.048
Tap once for no, twice for yes.

39:59.776 --> 40:00.776
Play the file.

40:20.694 --> 40:22.212
Shit.

40:22.247 --> 40:24.560
This way, we're back here.

40:25.457 --> 40:26.848
I'm gonna step in and do a
thorough sweep

40:26.872 --> 40:28.495
with the thermal and Ernie,

40:28.529 --> 40:30.566
you may wanna have your
camera on for this.

40:40.472 --> 40:41.335
Whoa, wait a minute.

40:41.369 --> 40:42.163
What you got?

40:42.198 --> 40:43.198
I'm not sure.

40:46.996 --> 40:48.722
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

40:50.033 --> 40:51.828
Ernie, we were just up here
with Layla,

40:51.863 --> 40:52.909
do you remember seeing this at
all,

40:52.933 --> 40:54.866
'cause I sure as hell don't.

40:54.900 --> 40:57.040
Is that a dead rat?

40:57.075 --> 40:58.145
Not just a dead rat.

40:58.179 --> 41:00.596
That's a dead rate that
was dinner for something.

41:00.630 --> 41:01.780
That couldn't
have been here earlier,

41:01.804 --> 41:03.322
we definitely would have seen
it.

41:03.357 --> 41:04.576
I know, right, and the FLIR is
showing

41:04.600 --> 41:06.602
that it's still warm, so
whatever attacked this,

41:06.636 --> 41:07.775
did this recently.

41:07.810 --> 41:11.986
It's got to be a cat or
something roaming around.

41:12.021 --> 41:15.196
Yeah, that would explain
all the dead rodents.

41:18.199 --> 41:19.753
What in the world made that
noise?

41:19.787 --> 41:22.065
It was like a metallic sound.

41:22.100 --> 41:25.103
Not even sure which
direction that came from.

41:25.137 --> 41:26.553
Maybe it was Jerod and Ernie?

41:26.587 --> 41:28.140
Melanie to Jerod, come in.

41:29.625 --> 41:30.625
Go ahead.

41:32.075 --> 41:34.802
We just heard a loud,
metallic noise down here.

41:34.837 --> 41:36.355
Was that you guys, over?

41:37.529 --> 41:39.013
Negative, we heard it too,

41:39.048 --> 41:40.498
and we thought it might've been
you.

41:40.532 --> 41:41.854
I was just about to check-in and
see,

41:41.878 --> 41:43.915
but you beat me to it, over.

41:45.261 --> 41:48.540
Okay, we're gonna try to
locate the source, over.

41:48.575 --> 41:49.403
All right, be aware there's

41:49.437 --> 41:50.508
rodents roaming around.

41:50.542 --> 41:51.474
Keep your eyes open for

41:51.509 --> 41:52.969
a possible stray animal in the
building.

41:52.993 --> 41:55.892
Ernie and I just found
a chewed up mouse, over.

41:59.309 --> 42:00.518
Okay, be careful.

42:00.552 --> 42:01.552
Over and out.

42:12.115 --> 42:14.980
Please confirm no one's
over in the guest area, over.

42:15.878 --> 42:17.673
Nope, Ernie
and I are still upstairs

42:17.707 --> 42:19.019
in the male ward, over.

42:19.916 --> 42:21.159
Negative, Terry,

42:21.193 --> 42:23.506
Nate and I are in the
lower female ward, over.

42:24.990 --> 42:25.990
Hm.

42:27.475 --> 42:31.203
That's very strange because
I just saw something in

42:31.238 --> 42:34.137
the guest corridor
camera freeze,

42:35.035 --> 42:39.039
then it started shaking
and now it seems

42:39.073 --> 42:41.317
like the camera's fallen
over on its side.

42:42.732 --> 42:44.596
Well, Terry, seeing
as how you're the closest

42:44.631 --> 42:46.125
and most available to
that side of the building,

42:46.149 --> 42:48.704
why don't you go
check it out, over.

42:53.122 --> 42:55.331
All right, I'll go
take a look at it.

42:59.059 --> 43:03.650
What I'm wondering is,
maybe that noise from the file

43:03.684 --> 43:07.515
room, and maybe it was the
file cabinet falling over.

43:08.655 --> 43:09.655
It's possible.

43:16.386 --> 43:18.526
That was weird as hell.

43:18.561 --> 43:20.667
You know what, that
musta been one

43:20.701 --> 43:22.703
of the guys messing with you.

43:22.738 --> 43:24.118
Probably Jerod.

43:24.153 --> 43:27.259
Guys, stop playing
over the radios.

43:29.399 --> 43:30.953
Damn it, Melanie, calm down,

43:30.987 --> 43:32.644
no one's playing
over the radios.

43:39.099 --> 43:41.170
Guys, I think I'm lost.

43:45.761 --> 43:48.591
Terry, where exactly are you?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.973
Terry, just find the
kitchen and you're back

43:51.007 --> 43:53.354
in the entrance of the building.

43:53.389 --> 43:56.875
Guys, I'm
hearing shit like a growl.

43:56.910 --> 43:58.187
A growl like an animal?

43:59.153 --> 44:00.337
I don't know
what the fuck it was.

44:00.361 --> 44:01.673
Do you fuckin' hear it man?

44:01.708 --> 44:03.502
Terry, we don't know
what kind of animal

44:03.537 --> 44:04.849
may be roaming around here.

44:12.132 --> 44:14.341
Look man, I ain't fucking around

44:14.375 --> 44:16.515
with any wild animals and shit.

44:16.550 --> 44:18.138
Terry, I hope to
God you're getting

44:18.172 --> 44:19.587
all of this on your glasses.

44:33.222 --> 44:35.155
Fuckin' kitchen, man.

44:37.088 --> 44:38.020
Terry, be careful.

44:38.054 --> 44:40.332
Let us know when
you're back, over.

44:59.973 --> 45:03.286
I'm pretty sure that the
file cabinet room was here.

45:03.321 --> 45:05.047
I don't remember
ever seeing one.

45:07.187 --> 45:08.740
We're not gonna make it.

45:08.775 --> 45:10.397
Battery's low.

45:10.431 --> 45:11.431
Shouldn't be.

45:13.089 --> 45:14.781
I know I took a full charge.

45:16.299 --> 45:18.992
Okay, let's go back.

45:25.757 --> 45:29.002
It's weird, because it's not
like a sensed a presence,

45:29.036 --> 45:31.625
but something is seriously
bugging me the hell out.

45:32.971 --> 45:34.259
Maybe there was
a loose vent cover in

45:34.283 --> 45:36.803
one of the rooms that was
swinging around.

45:36.837 --> 45:38.597
No, I don't think so.

45:39.564 --> 45:41.462
I mean that noise
was really loud.

45:42.291 --> 45:43.637
Hey guys.

45:43.671 --> 45:44.672
Any findings?

45:44.707 --> 45:45.950
Damn it, Jerod.

45:45.984 --> 45:47.572
What?

45:47.606 --> 45:48.918
And no.

45:48.953 --> 45:51.645
No, nothing interesting, just
that noise that we heard.

45:51.679 --> 45:54.199
Yeah, Ernie and I found
some half-eaten rat parts.

45:54.234 --> 45:55.822
Might be nothing,
but it does reiterate

45:55.856 --> 45:56.684
the most popular
claim about this place.

45:56.719 --> 45:58.583
And the thing is where we found

45:58.617 --> 46:00.550
them were places we all
toured earlier today.

46:00.585 --> 46:03.036
We definitely would have noticed
if they were there before.

46:03.070 --> 46:05.763
Yeah, these were left
there by something.

46:05.797 --> 46:06.971
Can I see the footage?

46:08.593 --> 46:10.353
There has to be
a pack of animals

46:10.388 --> 46:12.977
or somewhere nesting inside the
building.

46:13.011 --> 46:15.196
We need to debunk this
particular claim so when we do...

46:15.220 --> 46:16.220
Wait.

46:17.153 --> 46:18.153
Where is Terry?

46:24.229 --> 46:27.785
Jerod to Terry, what's
your status, over.

46:30.995 --> 46:32.720
What the fuck, Terry?

46:32.755 --> 46:33.755
Over.

46:37.242 --> 46:38.242
Terry!

46:47.908 --> 46:50.221
Terry, you better not
be fuckin' around.

46:50.255 --> 46:52.913
I'm gonna kick your fuckin'
ass if you fuckin' scare me.

47:05.546 --> 47:10.137
Jerod, no signs of
Terry over the feed, over.

47:16.764 --> 47:17.764
Terry?

47:21.045 --> 47:22.045
Terry?

47:25.601 --> 47:27.879
You got to be freakin' kidding
me.

47:27.914 --> 47:30.640
Damn battery's 1/3.

47:30.675 --> 47:32.677
But the camera just
showed me full bars.

47:34.092 --> 47:35.092
Oh, my God.

47:38.062 --> 47:39.304
Looks like blood.

47:42.929 --> 47:43.929
Shit, Nate.

47:49.625 --> 47:50.625
Terry?

47:54.250 --> 47:55.250
Terry?

48:01.257 --> 48:02.257
Fuck.

48:17.895 --> 48:18.895
Be careful, it might...

48:25.903 --> 48:27.594
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ.

48:29.458 --> 48:31.391
These rats are gonna
be the death of me.

48:34.428 --> 48:38.294
I am halfway through the first
floor and no sign of Terry.

48:40.745 --> 48:42.540
No sign of anything
for that matter.

49:00.558 --> 49:01.558
Terry?

49:32.072 --> 49:33.072
Hey.

49:39.252 --> 49:40.252
Holy fuck.

50:08.522 --> 50:09.661
Oh, my God, Nate.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.733
What is that?

50:12.768 --> 50:14.263
I don't know,
but I'm not touching it.

50:14.287 --> 50:16.392
Shit Mel, don't even
think of asking me.

50:16.427 --> 50:18.118
One of us has to
pull that thing outa

50:18.153 --> 50:20.051
there so we can see what it is.

50:21.984 --> 50:22.984
Please.

50:29.957 --> 50:32.546
All right, I'll do it for you.

50:33.651 --> 50:35.584
But I'm not touching
it with my hands.

50:35.618 --> 50:36.618
Okay.

51:05.200 --> 51:06.511
What is this?

51:06.546 --> 51:08.893
That looks like Terry's skin.

51:12.724 --> 51:13.829
God damn, Melanie.

51:15.693 --> 51:17.695
Why would a piece of
meat by lying here.

51:18.627 --> 51:20.180
It can't be Terry's.

51:20.215 --> 51:21.250
Who the hell would.

51:24.874 --> 51:25.874
Wait.

51:26.635 --> 51:28.085
Wait, wait.

51:28.119 --> 51:30.363
Wait just one god damn minute.

51:30.397 --> 51:32.848
I think I know what's
going on here.

51:32.882 --> 51:33.676
It's Jerod.

51:33.711 --> 51:34.791
What do you mean it's Jerod.

51:34.815 --> 51:36.093
He staged all this.

51:38.992 --> 51:40.718
What the hell are you doing?

51:40.752 --> 51:42.099
Relax, it's just a prop.

51:43.238 --> 51:44.653
- We can't blame.
- A prop?

51:44.687 --> 51:47.897
- Investigation 12 entirely.
- No that looks real.

51:47.932 --> 51:51.384
But why, why, why would
Jerod do this?

51:51.418 --> 51:52.626
Don't know.

51:52.661 --> 51:53.972
Maybe he's desperate.

51:54.007 --> 51:55.560
Taking extra precautions
to make sure

51:55.595 --> 51:58.011
we walk outa here with
some type of evidence.

51:58.045 --> 52:00.289
Maybe he thought this would
guarantee putting it over

52:00.324 --> 52:03.568
the top since Investigation
12 was a total failure.

52:03.603 --> 52:08.435
We can't blame Investigation
12 entirely on Jerod.

52:08.470 --> 52:10.023
I mean, you know him.

52:10.057 --> 52:11.611
He wouldn't do this.

52:12.508 --> 52:13.508
Come on, Mel.

52:14.234 --> 52:16.788
He has to make sure
things are perfect.

52:16.823 --> 52:18.480
Bloggers covering our
investigation

52:18.514 --> 52:19.929
has pressured him even more.

52:21.068 --> 52:24.589
He's desperate for things
to come out right, but this?

52:27.799 --> 52:28.904
This is too perfect.

52:30.975 --> 52:34.427
I will say whoever he got to
do this did a fantastic job.

52:34.461 --> 52:36.153
It seriously looks and
feels real.

52:37.050 --> 52:38.983
I guess the positive
comments from

52:39.017 --> 52:42.745
the committee did
boost his ego a little.

52:42.780 --> 52:45.507
Look, I think we need to
confront him about this as soon

52:45.541 --> 52:48.544
as possible, before it jeopardizes
the entire investigation.

53:38.456 --> 53:39.802
What the heck?

53:43.910 --> 53:45.853
This is Ernie, confirm that
no one's messing around

53:45.877 --> 53:47.500
in the Mole Man's cell, over.

53:49.156 --> 53:52.194
Nate and I are
still on the first floor, over.

53:52.229 --> 53:55.232
Terry, is that you
in the Mole Man's cell, over.

53:56.854 --> 53:57.855
You're closer,

53:57.889 --> 53:59.753
go get him and tell him
to stop playing games.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.377
I just saw him on the screen,

54:02.411 --> 54:04.137
why isn't he answering
his walkie?

54:05.518 --> 54:06.967
He must've
lost his walkie talkie.

54:07.002 --> 54:10.316
He might not even know
that we're looking for him.

54:10.350 --> 54:11.593
All right, over.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.180
Jerod!

54:18.324 --> 54:19.324
Jerod!

54:23.743 --> 54:26.021
So, what do you
think we should do

54:26.055 --> 54:27.747
if Jerod actually cops
up to this?

54:29.473 --> 54:31.337
I don't know.

54:31.371 --> 54:32.579
I mean, what can we do?

54:33.856 --> 54:35.962
His ego's the problem here.

54:35.996 --> 54:38.378
We shouldn't put our names on
any of these investigations

54:38.413 --> 54:41.692
if there's going to be god
damn stunts and secret agendas.

54:41.726 --> 54:45.696
What my concern is, is that
he's going to present these

54:45.730 --> 54:49.320
tainted facts with our
names attached.

54:54.498 --> 54:55.913
All most there.

54:57.363 --> 54:58.605
All most there.

55:18.901 --> 55:19.901
Terry?

55:23.665 --> 55:24.665
Please be you.

55:27.393 --> 55:28.393
Ugh, great.

55:44.824 --> 55:47.689
I can't believe we seriously
though Terry was dead.

55:48.793 --> 55:49.587
Guys.

55:49.622 --> 55:50.519
What the hell happened to you

55:50.554 --> 55:52.383
and why haven't you
been checking in.

55:52.418 --> 55:53.902
I'm sorry, I lost
my walkie talkie

55:53.936 --> 55:55.317
somewhere along the way.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.939
Well, isn't that convenient.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.908
Is that supposed to
mean something?

55:59.942 --> 56:00.736
I'm sorry, okay.

56:00.771 --> 56:02.117
I'll find it later.

56:02.151 --> 56:03.118
I was in a rush to
get back here.

56:03.152 --> 56:04.613
Something seriously
fucked up happened.

56:04.637 --> 56:07.467
What do you mean something
seriously fucked up happened?

56:07.502 --> 56:09.203
I was looking for Terry at
the back end of the hallway

56:09.227 --> 56:12.127
in the guest corridor, I
saw someone hunched over.

56:13.231 --> 56:15.199
I called out to him
and he stood up.

56:16.269 --> 56:17.350
It was like a homeless guy ready

56:17.374 --> 56:19.306
to attack me and lights
went out and...

56:19.341 --> 56:20.791
Come on, really?

56:20.825 --> 56:21.871
What makes you so sure it wasn't

56:21.895 --> 56:23.138
just Terry punkin' your ass.

56:23.172 --> 56:24.933
No way, this guy was much taller

56:24.967 --> 56:26.210
and completely malnourished.

56:26.244 --> 56:27.038
Okay, look.

56:27.073 --> 56:28.074
Just let me connect.

56:28.108 --> 56:30.076
All right, I'm just
gonna come out and ask.

56:30.110 --> 56:32.492
Jerod, did you purposely
stage any props

56:32.527 --> 56:34.391
in the building for
us to find tonight?

56:37.083 --> 56:38.395
Props?

56:38.429 --> 56:40.604
Are you for real right now?

56:40.638 --> 56:42.571
- No.
- Come on, man.

56:42.606 --> 56:43.928
We found the fake blood
you had all over

56:43.952 --> 56:45.125
the floor in the kitchen.

56:45.160 --> 56:46.720
But you just flat out
went way overboard

56:46.748 --> 56:48.681
with that whole bloody
piece of meat.

56:48.715 --> 56:51.373
What the fuck are
you even talking about?

56:51.408 --> 56:53.306
Of course I didn't
stage any god damn props

56:53.340 --> 56:55.422
and how dare you even accuse
me of some shit like that.

56:55.446 --> 56:58.553
I would never resort to any
scare tactics or gimmicks or any

56:58.587 --> 57:01.314
special effects to enhance
any of our investigations.

57:02.833 --> 57:04.662
Do you really think
I'd be that dumb?

57:05.836 --> 57:07.872
Bro, because you wanna make sure

57:07.907 --> 57:11.048
this investigation doesn't
turn into another 12.

57:11.082 --> 57:13.533
I've seen this movie before
and I know how it ends.

57:13.568 --> 57:15.362
It's 12 all over again.

57:15.397 --> 57:17.572
So why the fuck do I
want the same for 13?

57:21.472 --> 57:22.472
Okay.

57:23.923 --> 57:28.928
So, if it wasn't you then
that leaves Terry or Ernie.

57:33.001 --> 57:35.624
I told you, neither of those
guys are organized enough

57:35.659 --> 57:37.454
to try and pull off something
like that.

57:37.488 --> 57:39.456
Okay, then who else could it
be, Nate?

57:40.560 --> 57:43.494
Look, I don't know who
the fuck it was, okay?

57:43.529 --> 57:44.495
Could be a homeless
guy that's been

57:44.530 --> 57:46.014
squatting here for all I know.

57:47.256 --> 57:52.261
Guys, what are the possibilities
Parrish is doing this?

57:52.607 --> 57:53.642
No way.

57:53.677 --> 57:54.609
This was a man.

57:54.643 --> 57:55.758
Let me just show you the footage

57:55.782 --> 57:56.956
so you can see for yourself.

57:56.990 --> 57:59.648
Holy shit, I'm so
glad to see you guys.

57:59.683 --> 58:01.063
Ernie what happened?

58:01.098 --> 58:03.721
I heard a noise in the hallway
and I thought it was Terry

58:03.756 --> 58:05.689
so I went to the
Mole Man's cell,

58:05.723 --> 58:07.829
and I found the camera
completely destroyed.

58:07.863 --> 58:10.141
I mean, someone smashed
the shit out of it.

58:10.176 --> 58:11.591
What the fuck, Ernie.

58:11.626 --> 58:13.258
It was already like
this when I found it.

58:13.282 --> 58:15.260
Yeah, once I found out
whose responsible for this,

58:15.284 --> 58:16.976
I'm gonna beat the
living shit out of 'em.

58:17.010 --> 58:18.332
And that's when I came
straight back here...

58:18.356 --> 58:20.773
This has to be Terry, right?

58:20.807 --> 58:23.051
I mean, unless someone here
isn't telling the truth.

58:23.085 --> 58:24.604
What are you talking about?

58:24.639 --> 58:25.892
- We found a prop.
- Damn straight

58:25.916 --> 58:26.962
- we're doing this in groups.
- And some fake blood planted

58:26.986 --> 58:27.952
- in this building.
- Ernie and I will go find.

58:27.987 --> 58:29.102
- And Jerod claims that.
- Damn straight.

58:29.126 --> 58:30.023
- We're doing this in groups.
- He saw somebody else

58:30.058 --> 58:31.311
- here inside with us.
- Ernie and I will

58:31.335 --> 58:34.269
go find Terry, you guys stay
behind and watch the monitors.

58:38.376 --> 58:40.206
Look, fuck all you guys.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.494
This whole investigation
is turning

58:41.518 --> 58:43.140
into a flaming pile of dog shit.

58:43.174 --> 58:45.073
Terry's MIA and we
got some homeless guy

58:45.107 --> 58:46.661
running around destroying our
equipment

58:46.695 --> 58:48.328
and you guys are accusing
me of this shit?

58:48.352 --> 58:49.629
Well, fuck that.

58:49.664 --> 58:51.331
We're finding Terry,
we're getting out of here

58:51.355 --> 58:53.012
and we're aborting this
investigation.

58:53.046 --> 58:55.048
This is the most
important investigation yet.

58:55.083 --> 58:56.809
We don't have enough
to show the board.

58:56.843 --> 58:58.569
Okay, then I suggest that we go

58:58.604 --> 59:00.709
find Terry and we get some
answers.

59:00.744 --> 59:02.711
Damn straight, we're
doing this in groups.

59:02.746 --> 59:04.023
Ernie and I will go find Terry.

59:04.057 --> 59:05.818
You guys stay behind
and watch the monitors.

59:05.852 --> 59:07.509
Okay, but why don't
we go with you,

59:07.544 --> 59:08.728
because it'll speed things up.

59:08.752 --> 59:11.306
No, I want a team staying
here reporting any sightings

59:11.340 --> 59:14.481
of Terry or anybody or anything
walking around this place.

59:14.516 --> 59:16.287
Ernie and I are gonna start
on the top floor and work

59:16.311 --> 59:19.072
our way down and sweep every
god damn inch of this place.

59:19.107 --> 59:21.558
And if Terry comes back,
notify me immediately.

59:21.592 --> 59:23.111
Ernie, grab another camera.

59:28.668 --> 59:31.153
Whatever's happening here,
I want it documented.

59:31.982 --> 59:34.053
If this turns into some
potential legal matter,

59:34.087 --> 59:36.296
I want evidence to sue
that old hag Parrish.

59:37.539 --> 59:38.539
Ernie, let's go.

01:00:04.255 --> 01:00:06.395
Hey kid, things are slowing up.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:07.811
Good time to take five.

01:00:21.928 --> 01:00:23.136
Got a light?

01:00:25.725 --> 01:00:27.347
So, what's your story?

01:00:27.382 --> 01:00:28.797
I don't have one.

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:30.834
I see how you look
at me from that kitchen.

01:00:30.868 --> 01:00:32.559
You think you're in
some secret place

01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:35.355
watching from afar,
but I see you.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:37.910
Tell you what, there's that
new Tarzan movie playing

01:00:37.944 --> 01:00:40.429
at the Palladium tomorrow,
let's see if we can get

01:00:40.464 --> 01:00:42.708
that shyness out of
you in the dark.

01:00:42.742 --> 01:00:44.019
I said five minutes, damn it.

01:00:44.054 --> 01:00:45.054
Get back to work.

01:00:56.998 --> 01:00:58.206
I can't wait.

01:01:11.357 --> 01:01:12.738
Are you all right?

01:01:12.772 --> 01:01:14.015
Yeah.

01:01:14.947 --> 01:01:16.707
Leonard, what's wrong?

01:01:16.742 --> 01:01:19.123
These kids are messing with me.

01:01:25.647 --> 01:01:26.890
Hey, sit down.

01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:29.651
Don't mind them,
just watch the movie.

01:01:34.898 --> 01:01:36.658
Leonard, Leonard, no.

01:01:53.192 --> 01:01:54.780
What the hell happened to you?

01:01:54.814 --> 01:01:56.298
Don't you slam the
door in my house.

01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:58.853
Open the god damn door.

01:01:58.887 --> 01:02:01.407
Father please, not now.

01:02:01.441 --> 01:02:03.547
Boy, don't make
me come in and belt you.

01:02:03.581 --> 01:02:05.238
Now open up.

01:02:05.273 --> 01:02:08.794
Please, please father.

01:02:20.046 --> 01:02:23.740
Oh, that's
right, teach him good.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:28.641
Teach that no good mistake
of a child how to be rotten.

01:02:30.988 --> 01:02:33.542
Next time you
close the door real quiet.

01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:05.712
Rotten, that's all you are.

01:03:19.726 --> 01:03:20.831
Young man do not move.

01:03:20.866 --> 01:03:22.108
Stay right where you are.

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.593
What the hell?

01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:14.228
Terry?

01:04:19.476 --> 01:04:20.556
Are you sure that homeless guy

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:21.961
wasn't the Mole Man?

01:04:21.996 --> 01:04:25.137
Nah dude, he
was real, not ghostlike.

01:04:26.414 --> 01:04:27.587
I thought you said spirits

01:04:27.622 --> 01:04:29.658
can manifest in
different forms though.

01:04:31.384 --> 01:04:33.973
Ernie, if he was the Mole Man,

01:04:34.008 --> 01:04:36.079
wouldn't he have killed
me right on the spot?

01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:41.739
I think we went
down this way already.

01:04:41.774 --> 01:04:44.328
Nah, we haven't
gone this way yet.

01:04:44.363 --> 01:04:46.434
Okay, wait up.

01:04:53.924 --> 01:04:57.100
You think Jerod
was being honest?

01:04:57.134 --> 01:04:58.134
I don't know.

01:04:59.792 --> 01:05:04.072
I mean, if he's lying then
he's pretty damn convincing.

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:09.975
I'm just having a hard
time buying his story.

01:05:10.009 --> 01:05:13.219
Yeah, but Nate,
I mean he makes a point.

01:05:15.118 --> 01:05:18.328
This whole building has
been vacant for years.

01:05:18.362 --> 01:05:22.159
It's completely plausible
that maybe a homeless person

01:05:22.194 --> 01:05:24.299
broke in and is
living inside here.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:28.925
And if that's the case,
maybe he just thinks we're

01:05:28.959 --> 01:05:31.168
trespassing and he's pissed off.

01:05:31.203 --> 01:05:32.687
Trashing all our shit.

01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:34.447
How the hell's a
homeless dude gonna

01:05:34.482 --> 01:05:36.725
have access to any
props or makeup effects.

01:05:41.178 --> 01:05:42.178
Terry?

01:05:44.802 --> 01:05:46.711
I swear to God if he doesn't
have a good damn reason

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:48.185
for being gone I'm
gonna fire his ass

01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:49.911
on the spot and he
can walk home.

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:56.986
Jerod.

01:06:03.856 --> 01:06:05.754
No way, dude.

01:06:11.484 --> 01:06:13.383
What the fuck?

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:14.694
What are they looking at?

01:06:14.729 --> 01:06:16.006
Another dead rat?

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.010
Oh, oh shit.

01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:22.392
That is a real finger man,
I am not fucking kidding.

01:06:22.426 --> 01:06:25.636
No fuckin' way, are you serious?

01:06:25.671 --> 01:06:27.707
Yeah, I swear to God.

01:06:27.742 --> 01:06:31.021
I see the bone and veins
sticking out of it, man.

01:06:31.056 --> 01:06:33.092
There's fuckin' bite
marks all over it.

01:06:34.576 --> 01:06:37.200
Jerod, what exactly
are you guys looking at?

01:06:37.234 --> 01:06:40.513
Um, we just found a
severed finger on the floor.

01:06:40.548 --> 01:06:43.378
Jerod's 100% it's real,
not a prop.

01:06:45.035 --> 01:06:47.900
Ernie, swear on your mother's
grave

01:06:47.934 --> 01:06:49.395
that you're not trying to fuck
with us.

01:06:49.419 --> 01:06:51.317
Yes I fuckin' swear, Melanie.

01:06:51.352 --> 01:06:53.319
It looks like something
bit it off.

01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:54.872
We're both like spazzing
the fuck out

01:06:54.907 --> 01:06:56.322
right now just looking at it.

01:06:57.392 --> 01:06:58.393
Fuck!

01:06:58.428 --> 01:06:59.428
We're stuck here.

01:07:01.224 --> 01:07:02.777
Don't you get it, Nate?

01:07:14.168 --> 01:07:15.548
What was that?

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:19.414
Sounds like
it came from over there.

01:07:20.346 --> 01:07:23.039
Ernie, what is that?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.294
There's blood on the floor here

01:07:26.318 --> 01:07:28.906
leading all down the stairwell.

01:07:31.323 --> 01:07:34.464
All right, I'll tell you
all right fucking now when we

01:07:34.498 --> 01:07:37.122
find out whose responsible for
conspiring this whole prank

01:07:37.156 --> 01:07:39.124
I am personally gonna
beat their sorry ass

01:07:39.158 --> 01:07:40.918
like there's no god
damn tomorrow.

01:07:40.953 --> 01:07:41.953
Believe that.

01:07:44.646 --> 01:07:46.234
Don't you get it, Nate?

01:07:47.304 --> 01:07:49.341
Nobody's fucking around here.

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:50.997
This isn't a prank anymore.

01:07:52.033 --> 01:07:53.345
This is real and Terry can be in

01:07:53.379 --> 01:07:56.210
some serious trouble
and we need to find him.

01:07:56.244 --> 01:07:57.659
Didn't you hear Jerod?

01:07:57.694 --> 01:08:00.179
He wouldn't sabotage
Investigation 13.

01:08:00.214 --> 01:08:02.940
Because, Mel,
there's no more time.

01:08:02.975 --> 01:08:05.357
He has to get this right or
it's his reputation on the line.

01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:07.428
That doesn't make any sense.

01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:08.888
The Jerod that I
know wouldn't even...

01:08:08.912 --> 01:08:11.777
Listen, Mel, I think you're
blinded by the fact that you

01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:14.987
still got a thing for him, but
you need to open your eyes.

01:08:15.021 --> 01:08:17.541
Look, I admit that I
was skeptical at first,

01:08:17.576 --> 01:08:20.510
but the reality is is that
Terry's in serious trouble

01:08:20.544 --> 01:08:25.135
and I don't know if it's a wild
animal or even the Mole Man.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.792
Terry's losing blood
by the second,

01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:29.069
and he needs our help.

01:08:30.796 --> 01:08:35.801
Look, I'm trying really
hard to see both sides

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:40.081
of the coin here and
it's tough, believe me.

01:08:41.013 --> 01:08:42.635
But I could really
use your help.

01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:57.270
Jerod.

01:09:07.004 --> 01:09:08.558
I don't know about this, Jerod.

01:09:26.403 --> 01:09:27.645
I hate this place.

01:09:33.064 --> 01:09:34.170
Dude, are you okay.

01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:38.207
Jerod man, this is
seriously fucked!

01:09:38.243 --> 01:09:40.520
We need to get out of
here right now.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:43.386
Screw Terry, I'm shitting
my pants right now.

01:09:44.456 --> 01:09:45.974
Ernie, we need to find Terry

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:48.045
before he freakin'
bleeds to death.

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.529
I don't like that idea.

01:09:49.564 --> 01:09:52.153
We need to get out of here
and get help to find Terry.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:54.914
Ernie, if it was you
that was missing,

01:09:54.949 --> 01:09:56.813
I would do the exact same thing.

01:09:57.883 --> 01:09:59.056
Now, keep it together.

01:11:20.414 --> 01:11:23.658
Holy shit.

01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:39.259
Oh, shit.

01:11:41.366 --> 01:11:43.713
Jerod, what the fuck was that?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.347
Nate to Melanie, respond please.

01:11:57.382 --> 01:11:58.486
Jerod and Ernie are...

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.835
Shit.

01:12:20.405 --> 01:12:21.405
Terry.

01:12:23.753 --> 01:12:25.582
We're aborting the
investigation.

01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:13.699
Electro convulsive number one.

01:13:15.701 --> 01:13:16.806
Patient is being prescribed

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.981
this regime to modify
his behavior.

01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:23.157
Treatment of 150 volts.

01:13:24.745 --> 01:13:28.576
Attempt number 27, 250 volts.

01:13:33.029 --> 01:13:35.687
Attempt number 78, 325.

01:13:39.345 --> 01:13:42.832
500 volts, the only
regime to subdue patient.

01:13:44.696 --> 01:13:46.594
Continue treatment
at maximum levels.

01:13:53.221 --> 01:13:54.221
Dear God.

01:14:54.628 --> 01:14:59.633
Layla Parrish performing
electric shock

01:14:59.978 --> 01:15:01.531
therapy on Leonard Craven.

01:15:04.776 --> 01:15:05.776
Oh, my God.

01:15:06.778 --> 01:15:07.778
It's her.

01:15:30.871 --> 01:15:34.081
Melanie, Melanie,
Melanie, it's me.

01:15:34.115 --> 01:15:35.496
It's me, it's me.

01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:38.291
Nate.

01:15:39.362 --> 01:15:42.538
Nate, we're never
getting out of here.

01:15:44.436 --> 01:15:46.714
No, no, no, listen to me.

01:15:46.749 --> 01:15:48.164
We're gonna get out of here.

01:15:48.198 --> 01:15:50.546
- You promise?
- Yes, come on.

01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:51.592
Wait, I have info about...

01:15:51.616 --> 01:15:53.341
Later, we need to
get to the boiler room.

01:15:53.376 --> 01:15:54.584
But it's about Parrish!

01:15:54.619 --> 01:15:56.621
Not now, Ernie's in trouble.

01:16:00.003 --> 01:16:03.213
The blood trail runs all the
way through here right up

01:16:03.248 --> 01:16:05.906
to the coal storage room
where they saw that thing.

01:16:24.027 --> 01:16:25.027
There.

01:16:25.753 --> 01:16:26.753
Jesus.

01:16:27.997 --> 01:16:29.999
Here, hold this.

01:16:41.769 --> 01:16:44.047
This doesn't look like it's
broken.

01:16:44.082 --> 01:16:46.256
Play, play the next file.

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:47.291
Play file.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.440
Ernie, Ernie?

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:01.616
Come on.

01:17:08.900 --> 01:17:10.729
Ernie say something.

01:17:15.872 --> 01:17:16.872
Shit.

01:17:20.946 --> 01:17:22.499
God damn it, it's low.

01:17:22.534 --> 01:17:25.019
Keep filming, keep rolling
till it fucking dies,

01:17:25.054 --> 01:17:27.056
the police need to see
everything.

01:17:31.785 --> 01:17:34.580
What the fuck happened to you?

01:17:34.615 --> 01:17:35.615
Guys.

01:17:52.737 --> 01:17:53.737
Ernie?

01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:10.512
Fuck!

01:18:18.970 --> 01:18:22.905
I know you're petrified, but
we have to do this together.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.528
Can you do this?

01:18:29.187 --> 01:18:30.809
Let's go, let's go.

01:18:30.844 --> 01:18:32.293
Come on, come on.

01:18:48.033 --> 01:18:49.690
Nate, say something.

01:18:53.487 --> 01:18:54.695
Oh shit.

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:57.733
Oh, shit, oh shit,
oh shit, oh shit.

01:19:26.244 --> 01:19:28.142
This is all my fault.

01:19:29.972 --> 01:19:31.692
I'm so sorry for the
way I treated you, Mel.

01:20:25.682 --> 01:20:28.064
Jerod, he's here.

01:20:30.170 --> 01:20:31.550
Okay, hurry.

01:20:31.585 --> 01:20:33.138
Hurry, hurry, shit.

01:20:35.106 --> 01:20:36.072
It's not opening.

01:20:36.107 --> 01:20:38.626
Something's blocking the door.

01:20:40.042 --> 01:20:43.045
The ventilation shaft that
Brian Resner used to sneak in.

01:20:43.079 --> 01:20:44.840
It's too high,
we can't get to it.

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:46.186
Yeah, come on.

01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:51.190
Shit.

01:20:53.262 --> 01:20:54.262
Shit.

01:21:05.550 --> 01:21:06.344
Oh, shit.

01:21:06.378 --> 01:21:07.378
Oh, fuck.

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:12.315
Shit, grab my hand.

01:21:23.948 --> 01:21:25.950
There he is, Jerod.

01:21:27.192 --> 01:21:28.192
No!

01:21:30.955 --> 01:21:34.130
Jerod, oh my, oh, Jerod,
Jerod, Jerod.

01:21:34.959 --> 01:21:35.959
Oh shit.

01:25:36.717 --> 01:25:39.341
We're finally awake, Mr. Craven.

01:25:39.375 --> 01:25:42.482
Please, please no shock.

01:25:42.516 --> 01:25:44.691
I'm not going
to shock you sweetie.

01:25:44.725 --> 01:25:46.589
That treatment is barbaric.

01:25:46.624 --> 01:25:48.212
It's ineffective.

01:25:48.246 --> 01:25:49.637
What are you
going to do to me then?

01:25:49.661 --> 01:25:54.563
Are you familiar
with the ways of the shaman?

01:25:54.597 --> 01:25:57.428
They're known as healers,
able to communicate with

01:25:57.462 --> 01:26:00.362
the spirit realm and other
dimensions.

01:26:00.396 --> 01:26:03.399
I've traveled the world
and learned of their ways,

01:26:03.434 --> 01:26:05.608
and I'm here to free you.

01:26:05.643 --> 01:26:07.196
From what?

01:26:07.231 --> 01:26:11.131
The evil that
is deep inside you.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.168
I know you're not evil, Leonard.

01:26:14.686 --> 01:26:16.550
You want me to
help you, Leonard?

01:26:18.276 --> 01:26:21.452
Very well, let's begin.

01:27:13.952 --> 01:27:16.092
Looks like he's got away.

01:27:16.127 --> 01:27:17.715
Inform the others.

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:25.343
I know you're
still here, Leonard.

01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:38.839
If I can't keep the evil
out of you, Leonard,

01:27:38.874 --> 01:27:43.223
then I have no choice but to
keep you in here for good.
