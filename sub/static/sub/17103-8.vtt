Management:
BEHOLD THE USHER.

01:47.775 --> 01:52.880
A DARK HEART DWELLS
WHERE BRANCHES MEET.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.416
ANOINTED DAGGER...

01:56.617 --> 01:58.752

Stroud:
LOOKS LIKE YOU
COULD USE A HAND.

04:05.145 --> 04:07.047
( gurgles )

04:07.147 --> 04:09.016
HENRY SCUDDER, RIGHT?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.485
MY NAME IS STROUD,
VARLYN STROUD.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.655
YOU LED ME
A MERRY CHASE.

04:14.755 --> 04:19.360
I GOT A FRIEND
WHO'S JUST DYING
TO MEET YOU.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.167
SCUDDER!

04:27.267 --> 04:30.103
SCUDDER?

04:30.203 --> 04:32.239
SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENED.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.207
SOMETHING
TERRIBLE BAD.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.444
WHAT'S SCUDDER
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

04:36.544 --> 04:38.011
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

04:38.111 --> 04:41.949
NO, I JUST HEARD
YOU YELLING.

04:42.049 --> 04:44.585
I GOT TO STOP HIM!

04:44.685 --> 04:46.720
HAWKINS!

04:48.322 --> 04:50.858
( yelling )

04:50.958 --> 04:54.428

- ( singing )

05:15.015 --> 05:17.618
* LAZY BONES

05:17.718 --> 05:21.889
* SLEEPIN' IN THE SHADE

05:21.989 --> 05:24.592
* HOW--

05:42.009 --> 05:43.444
HEY.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.647
I GOT AN IDEA.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.953
- ( bawdy music playing )
- ( men hooting )

06:17.611 --> 06:19.847
- WELL.
- ( cheering )

06:19.947 --> 06:22.483
HOLY CATS, GENTLEMEN!
HOLY CATS!

06:22.583 --> 06:25.218
IT LOOKS LIKE MISS LULU
IS OUT OF CONTROL TONIGHT!

06:25.318 --> 06:27.688
BOYS, I WOULD NOT
BE SURPRISED

06:27.788 --> 06:32.893
IF SHE MIGHT BE PERSUADED
TO DO HER FAMOUS BULGARIAN
MUSCLE DANCE!

06:32.993 --> 06:36.564
- WHERE THE HELL IS LIBBY?
- I HAVEN'T SEEN HER YET.

06:36.664 --> 06:40.434
WHAT'S THAT, MISS LULU?
NO, NOT THE RED-LIGHT SHOW!

06:40.534 --> 06:42.102
NOT THE RED-LIGHT SHOW!

06:42.202 --> 06:45.639
THAT'S BEEN BANNED IN SEVEN--
NO, EIGHT STATES!

06:45.739 --> 06:49.610
AND THAT'S JUST ON THIS SIDE
OF THE MISSISSIPPI!

06:49.710 --> 06:53.213
THAT'S FOUR DOUBLE-TROTS
IN A ROW. I'M DYING!

06:53.313 --> 06:55.916
GENTLEMEN,
YES, INDEEDY.
YES, INDEEDY.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.018
NOW IF YOU'LL JUST STEP
RIGHT ON THROUGH

06:58.118 --> 07:00.488
TO THE NEXT TENT HERE,
WHERE MISS LULU WILL

07:00.588 --> 07:04.992
REVEAL HER MOST INTIMATE
OF SECRETS!

07:20.808 --> 07:22.309
NO.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.512
NO.

07:28.415 --> 07:30.551
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:30.651 --> 07:33.754
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

07:33.854 --> 07:36.156
WE WERE LISTENING
TO THE RADIO

07:36.256 --> 07:39.059
AND I MUST'VE FAINTED.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.630
AND THEN?

07:43.597 --> 07:46.700
NOTHING.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.403
IT SEEMS YOU HAD
ONE OF YOUR SPELLS.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.573
SPELLS?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.942
IT WAS NOTHING,
ALEXSEI.

07:55.042 --> 07:57.077
YOU JUST NEED
SOME REST, THAT'S ALL.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.547
GO TO SLEEP NOW.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.657
THANK YOU, ELEANOR.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.926
MISS IRIS?

08:14.361 --> 08:16.864
DID YOU SEE?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.666
DID I SEE WHAT?

08:18.766 --> 08:20.601
THE DEVIL IN HIM,

08:20.701 --> 08:23.070
I SAW THE DEVIL.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.538
SHAME ON YOU, ELEANOR.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.841
YOU KNOW BROTHER JUSTIN
IS A MAN OF GOD.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.220
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

08:42.723 --> 08:46.026
JESUS--
HEY, BUD, HEY.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.728
( breathing heavily )

08:47.828 --> 08:49.963
I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD STOP BY.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.766
IS THAT A FACT?

08:52.866 --> 08:55.569
LOOK, I KNOW
DAMASCUS AIN'T EXACTLY
ON THE CIRCUIT--

08:55.669 --> 08:59.072
WHAT CIRCUIT?
YOU PEOPLE MOVE AROUND LIKE
A PACK OF DRUNK MONKEYS.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.408
I THOUGHT WE AGREED THAT YOU
WERE GOING TO TELL ME--

09:01.508 --> 09:04.177
NOW, I KNOW.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE WORD
AT THE LAST TOWN WE WERE AT,

09:04.277 --> 09:06.413
- BUT THE THING IS--
- YOU WERE HOPING YOU
COULD DUCK ME.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.316
- NO, NO--
- COUGH IT UP, YOU CHISELING
SON OF A BITCH.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.420
COUGH IT UP,
OR SO HELP ME GOD,
I'LL POUND IT OUT OF YOU.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.122
TROUBLE HERE?

09:15.222 --> 09:18.191
- OH HELL, RITA! JEEZ!
- Both: SHUT UP.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.295
YOU WANNA SLAP HIM AROUND,
HAVE AT IT.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.064
BUT IF YOU WANT
YOUR DOUGH,

09:24.164 --> 09:26.800
YOU'D BEST COME ON IN HERE
AND TALK TO ME.

09:29.770 --> 09:32.072
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.112
SHE WAS JUST KIDDING
ABOUT SLAPPING ME AROUND.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.162
HE GOT AWAY.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.970
GODDAMN SCUDDER.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.374
HE FINALLY DID IT.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.943
HE DIDN'T DO
NOTHING.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.148
IT WAS ME.
I DID IT.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.950
NOT SCUDDER.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.653
WHY?

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF,
REMEMBER?

10:22.122 --> 10:26.326
TO HIM WE'RE ALL JUST
PIECES IN ONE BIG GAME.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.162
HE WAS A PIECE TOO.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.731
HE HAD TO DIE.

10:30.831 --> 10:34.001
AND HE HAD TO MAKE SURE
I WAS THE ONE WHO KILLED HIM.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.670
- WHAT'RE YOU SAYING?
- I'M SAYING, ALL THOSE YEARS,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.739
HE WASN'T TRYING
TO FIND SCUDDER.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.774
HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP TABS ON HIM.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.543
JUST LIKE HE
KEPT TABS ON ME.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.412
LODZ, RUTHIE
THAT WAS A TEST.

10:45.512 --> 10:48.315
THAT WAS A DRY RUN
TO MAKE SURE
I HAD IT IN ME.

10:48.415 --> 10:49.883
ONCE HE KN
FOR SURE I DID,

10:49.983 --> 10:53.220
ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS
PUT THE PIECES IN PLACE.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.088
HIM, SCUDDER, ME,

10:55.188 --> 10:58.225
ALL OF US, HERE
IN THIS TRAILER.

10:58.325 --> 11:02.362
HE KNEW I COULDN'T KILL HIM
EXCEPT TO SAVE MY FATHER.

11:09.469 --> 11:12.505
SO THE SIMPLE MATTER IS...

11:12.605 --> 11:14.307
YOU CAN BEAT A STONE,

11:14.407 --> 11:15.776
YOU CAN BUST ITS LEGS--

11:15.876 --> 11:18.545
HELL, YOU CAN EVEN RUN IT
OVER WITH YOUR AUTOMOBILE,

11:18.645 --> 11:22.282
BUT YOU CAN'T GET BLOOD
OUT OF IT.

11:22.382 --> 11:25.853
- SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
- THERE'S A DEPRESSION ON.

11:25.953 --> 11:30.724
I'M SURE THIS ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEBODY
HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO PAY UP.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.764
MAYBE WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.133
MAYBE.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.845
WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO 10% OF THE GATE?

11:51.945 --> 11:55.949
JUST UNTIL WE
GET OURSELVES SQUARED UP.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.986
HMM.
WHAT ABOUT THE VIG?

11:59.586 --> 12:01.721
OH, BUD,

12:01.822 --> 12:05.926
YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP
YOUR METER RUNNING OVERTIME
ON ACCOUNT OF US.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.836
THERE'S MORE THAN
ONE KIND OF INTEREST.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.839
MAYBE FOR YOU.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.374
AS FOR ME, THE INTEREST
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR DOWN THERE

12:21.474 --> 12:24.411
GOT SHOT OFF IN A BARLEY FIELD
OUTSIDE OF AVIGNON.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.582
100 BUCKS!

12:29.682 --> 12:33.053
COLD AND HARD AND IN MY HAND
AT THE END OF EACH WEEK,
EVERY WEEK,

12:33.153 --> 12:35.856
UNTIL YOU'VE PAID OFF
THE PRINCIPAL, PLUS THE VIG.

12:35.956 --> 12:39.259
MISS A PAYMENT,
WE'LSEE IF I CAN'T
MAKE A STONE BLEED.

12:41.728 --> 12:43.931
I WAGER I CAN.

12:49.402 --> 12:52.072
- ( tent flutters )
- ( sighs )

12:54.007 --> 12:56.109
SO YOU'RE SAYING
HE SET THE WHOLE THING UP?

12:56.209 --> 12:59.246
"BY THE HAND
OF THE PRINCE...

13:01.949 --> 13:05.185
THE PROPHET DIES.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.555
UPON HIS DEATH,
THE PRINCE SHALL RISE."

13:08.655 --> 13:11.458
THE PRINCE,
THAT'S ME.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.626
MANAGEMENT WAS
THE PROPHET.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.096
IT'S ALL
IN THIS BOOK.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.531
HE NEEDED ME
TO KILL HIM.

13:18.631 --> 13:20.800
WHY?

13:20.901 --> 13:23.303
WHEN I KILLED HIM,

13:23.403 --> 13:26.173
EVERYTHING HE WAS,
EVERYTHING HE KNEW,

13:26.273 --> 13:29.242
EVERYTHING HE BELIEVED,
HE GAVE IT TO ME.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.978
HE HAD TO.

13:31.078 --> 13:33.180
HE KNEW THAT WAS
THE ONLY CHANCE I HAD
AGAINST THE USHER.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.250
- THE USHER.
- ALEXSEI BELYAKOV.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.886
HIS SON.

13:38.986 --> 13:42.422
THAT'S BULLSHIT!
NOTHING BUT LIES.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.058
THEY AIN'T LIES!
YOU KNEW HIM.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.295
YOU KNEW THE WAY
HE DID THINGS.

13:49.696 --> 13:53.300
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I DID!

13:53.400 --> 13:56.403
AND YOU KILLED HIM,
YOU DUMB HICK SON OF A BITCH!

14:07.847 --> 14:09.682
HEY, SOFIE.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.019
OPEN UP.
IT'S ME.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.556
HEY, SOF.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.892
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.660
WHERE'S SOFIE?

14:20.760 --> 14:22.329
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE RUN OFF

14:22.429 --> 14:25.132
BACK AFTER WE STOPPED
FOR THEM DAILY BROTHERS.

14:26.333 --> 14:30.603
- THAT CAN'T BE.
- WELL, IT IS.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.339
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
SHE WENT?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.007
HAS SHE TOLD ANYBODY?

14:34.107 --> 14:37.410
- LEFT A NOTE?
- NOT A WORD.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.612
JUST PFFT, SCRAMSKI.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.548
NO, SHE WOULDN'T
DO THAT.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.783
NOT AFTER--

14:43.883 --> 14:46.719
AFTER WHAT,
LOVERBOY?

14:46.819 --> 14:50.890
DON'T TELL ME YOU
FINALLY PUT THE BOOTS
TO THAT LITTLE BISCUIT.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.326
( laughing )

14:54.928 --> 14:57.330
( laughing
continues )

15:25.558 --> 15:28.061
HEY. WHATCHA GOT?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.532
( radio playing music )

15:34.167 --> 15:36.469
( phone ringing )

15:39.472 --> 15:42.442
- CROWE RESIDENCE.
- Stroud: I need to talk
to Brother Justin.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.445
- HE'S INDISPOSED.
- How long is he going
to be indisposed?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.180
- I DON'T KNOW HOW--
- Oh, come on.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.750
- I'M SORRY.
- IS THAT MCNAUGHTON AGAIN?

15:50.850 --> 15:53.253
IT'S THAT MAN--
STROUD.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.235
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- Nebraska.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.838
- I'VE MANAGED
TO FIND OUR FRIEND.
- Scudder?

16:11.938 --> 16:14.741
UH-HUH.
HE'S WITH ME RIGHT NOW.

16:14.841 --> 16:18.078
- WHEN WILL YOU BE HERE?
- Two, three days, tops.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.080
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.948
OH YEAH, I'M FINE.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.351
FIT AS A FIDDLE.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.439
( panting )

17:10.230 --> 17:12.799
( screaming )

17:27.714 --> 17:30.049
- CAN I HELP YOU?
- THANK YOU, FRIEND,

17:30.150 --> 17:32.185
BUT I THINK
I'LL HELP MYSELF.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.355
- ( guns cock )
- HAND OVER THE CASH BOX.

17:35.455 --> 17:39.326
- GIVE ME THE DAMN
MONEY, HAYSEED!
- ( girl laughing )

17:42.129 --> 17:44.431
OOH. THAT'S RIGHT.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.168
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.637
- ( gunshot )
- ( groans )

17:50.737 --> 17:52.372
( screams )

17:55.275 --> 17:57.310
PRAISE THE LORD!

18:00.747 --> 18:01.881
HEY!

18:01.981 --> 18:04.617
SLAP-HAPPY!

18:04.717 --> 18:08.188
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT
OURSELVES A RAGTOP.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.829
( wind gusting )

18:40.420 --> 18:42.755
( flies buzzing )

18:47.360 --> 18:49.762
( louder buzzing )

18:53.065 --> 18:55.067
( buzzing quiets )

18:55.168 --> 18:57.470
( louder buzzing )

18:57.570 --> 18:59.472
WEST.

19:00.873 --> 19:02.675
WEST.

19:29.969 --> 19:32.305
( gasps )

19:34.374 --> 19:36.409
YOU'RE AWAKE.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.146
I BROUGHT YOU SOME JOE.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.549
- THANKS.
- YEAH.

19:48.921 --> 19:52.525
YEAH!
AIN'T THAT SOMETHING?

19:52.625 --> 19:55.695
WELL, I BETTER, UH...
BETTER HOP TO IT.

19:55.795 --> 19:57.664
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP
THE BOYS WAITING.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.567
YEAH, ME TOO.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.802
YEAH.

20:20.287 --> 20:23.256
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?!

20:26.158 --> 20:27.960
( groans )

20:28.060 --> 20:31.664
ARE YOU CRACKERS?!
SHACKING UP WITH THAT GIMP
FOR EVERYBODY TO SEE?

20:31.764 --> 20:33.566
- I WAS JUST--
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WAS JUST!

20:33.666 --> 20:36.869
YOU'RE JUST BREAKING
YOUR DADDY'S HEART,
THAT'S WHAT YOU WAS JUST!

20:36.969 --> 20:38.771
GOOD LORD,
WHAT DID I RAISE!

20:38.871 --> 20:41.774
- ( screams )
- DON'T YOU PUT THE HIGH HAT
ON WITH ME, LITTLE LADY!

20:41.874 --> 20:44.210
YOU AIN'T TOO OLD
I CAN'T TAKE A SWITCH TO YOU!

20:44.311 --> 20:47.980
OH YEAH?
MAYBE I'M TOO MARRIED!

20:55.555 --> 20:56.889
HIM?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.991
YEAH, HIM.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.665
( sobbing )

21:05.765 --> 21:08.601
AIN'T YOU GONNA
CONGRATULATE ME?

21:17.344 --> 21:19.446
HAVEN'T YOU EVER
HEARD OF KNOCKING?

21:19.546 --> 21:21.748
I GOT IT FIGURED OUT!

21:21.848 --> 21:23.115
GOT WHAT FIGURED OUT?

21:23.215 --> 21:24.751
WE GOT TO PACK IT UP
AND HEAD WEST.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.454
- I FELT HIM OUT THERE.
- IS THAT A FACT?

21:27.554 --> 21:29.922
YEP!
WE CAN'T WASTE
NO TIME, NEITHER.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.491
HE GOT A HEAD START ON US.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.693
BUT IF WE HUSTLE OUT NOW
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CATCH UP!

21:33.793 --> 21:36.629
- WHO THE HELL IS "HE"?
- THE BALD FELLA!

21:36.729 --> 21:39.399
THE ONE THAT TORCHED
THE DAILY BROTHERS OUTFIT!

21:39.499 --> 21:42.802
HE'S CONNECTED
TO THE USHER SOMEHOW.
I KNOW IT!

21:42.902 --> 21:45.572
HE CAN LEAD US RIGHT TO HIM,
BUT WE GOT TO GET MOVING NOW!

21:45.672 --> 21:49.609
IF YOU'RE SO POWERFUL,
YOU BRING HIM BACK.

21:52.111 --> 21:55.014
WHAT'D YOU DO WITH HIM?

21:55.848 --> 21:57.617
WHO?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.358
MANAGEMENT!

22:05.458 --> 22:07.293
OH, JESUS.

22:07.394 --> 22:08.995
WE AIN'T GOT TIME
FOR THIS NOW!

22:09.095 --> 22:12.365
- DIDN'T YOU
HEAR WHAT I SAID?
- WHERE THE HELL IS HE?

22:14.801 --> 22:16.736
HE--

22:18.471 --> 22:21.173
HE ASCENDED.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.209
ASCENDED?

22:23.309 --> 22:26.413
- YEAH.
- WHAT THE HELL IS
THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

22:26.513 --> 22:29.949
HE WENT UP TO--
I DON'T KNOW,
TO HEAVEN.

22:32.552 --> 22:36.122
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE,
GOD DAMN IT.

22:36.222 --> 22:41.594
- I NEED YOUR HELP.
- YOU KILLED HIM,
DAMN IT!

22:41.694 --> 22:44.363
LOOK AT WHAT YOU KILLED,
YOU IGNORANT HAYSEED!

22:44.464 --> 22:46.599
GODDAMN RUBE!

22:46.699 --> 22:48.535
DON'T YOU SEE WHAT HE WAS?

22:48.635 --> 22:51.571
I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT I AM!

22:56.042 --> 22:59.512
WELL, THERE WAS ONE THING
HE WAS THAT YOU AIN'T--

23:00.480 --> 23:03.115
MY FRIEND.

23:06.152 --> 23:09.689
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
PRINCE.

23:09.789 --> 23:12.559
I'LL GIVE YOU
ALL THE HELP YOU NEED

23:12.659 --> 23:17.430
AS SOON AS YOU
BRING HIM BACK.

23:18.264 --> 23:20.733
( door creaks open )

23:40.119 --> 23:45.291
Man:
I'M FLATTERED, BROTHER JUSTIN,
I REALLY I AM.

23:45.391 --> 23:48.928
BUT I DOUBT MY NAME
WILL PASS MUSTER WITH
THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.498
WE NEED MEN LIKE YOU
IN WASHINGTON,
MR. TEMPLETON.

23:51.598 --> 23:55.401
TY DIVINE
IS A SOCIALIST
AND A DEGENERATE.

23:55.502 --> 23:56.536
AN ATHEIST.

23:56.636 --> 23:59.071
HE'S ALSO AN INCUMBENT.

23:59.171 --> 24:00.773
THE MAN'S UNTOUCHABLE.

24:00.873 --> 24:03.676
WELL, VAL,
I THINK YOU'RE SELLING
YOURSELF SHORT THERE.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.713
OH, NED.
THE FIX HAS BEEN IN
ON THIS DISTRICT

24:06.813 --> 24:09.849
SINCE THEY
REDREW THE BOUNDARIES
IN THE LAST CENSUS.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.951
MR. TEMPLETON,
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

24:12.051 --> 24:14.754
HOW MANY PEOPLE LISTEN
TO MY BROTHER EVERY WEEK?

24:14.854 --> 24:17.123
THOUSANDS.

24:17.223 --> 24:19.058
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS.

24:19.158 --> 24:22.795
WE'RE PLANNING
A SPECIAL CANDLELIGHT SERVICE
FOR NEXT SUNDAY EVENING,

24:22.895 --> 24:25.698
A SERMON ON THE MOUNT
FOR A NEW AMERICA.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.835
I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE YOU
TO BE A KEYNOTE SPEAKER.

24:28.935 --> 24:33.372
IT TAKES MORE THAN
ONE SPEECH TO WIN
AN ELECTION.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.042
IT TAKES ORGANIZATION.
IT TAKES MONEY.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.443
MONEY IS NO PROBLEM.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.212
IT TAKES MANPOWER--
PEOPLE WALKING DOOR TO DOOR.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.515
YES,
OF COURSE IT DOES.

24:43.282 --> 24:46.986
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE.

24:51.558 --> 24:54.460
THAT CENSUS
YOU MENTIONED
A MOMENT AGO,

24:54.561 --> 24:57.129
THAT WAS FOR 1930,
WAS IT NOT?

24:57.229 --> 24:58.497
YES, IT WAS.

24:58.598 --> 25:00.199
DID IT HAPPEN TO RECORD

25:00.299 --> 25:02.569
THE NUMBER
OF REGISTERED VOTERS
IN THE DTRICT?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.270
YES, SIR,
THAT IT DID.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.674
AND DO YOU HAPPEN
TO RECALL THAT NUMBER,
MR. TEMPLETON?

25:07.774 --> 25:11.611
- NED?
- 5,319.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.345
MORE OR LESS.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.147
HMM.

25:15.247 --> 25:19.018
THERE'S MORE THAN
THREE TIMES THAT NUMBER
LIVING HERE NOW.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.520
OVER 17,000 SOULS.

25:21.621 --> 25:23.089
WE PROVIDE THEM FOOD,

25:23.189 --> 25:26.325
SHELTER, BLANKETS, TOYS
FOR THEIR CHILDREN,

25:26.425 --> 25:28.294
MEDICINE FOR THEIR
SICK AND ELDERLY.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.029
NOW I WONDER,

25:30.129 --> 25:33.365
WHO DO YOU SUPPOSE
THEY WILL VOTE FOR
COME NOVEMBER?

25:33.465 --> 25:37.236
ANYBODY YOU
TELL THEM TO.

25:38.605 --> 25:41.407
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:41.507 --> 25:43.009
Barker:
AND HERE YOU GO!

25:47.213 --> 25:49.582
Rita Sue: NO!

25:51.350 --> 25:53.185
THOSE ARE MINE!

25:53.285 --> 25:54.821
THIS IS
RIDICULOUS.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.523
YOU ARE TOO YOUNG
TO GET MARRIED TO JONES,
OR TO ANYONE.

25:57.624 --> 26:00.126
- DADDY!
- SHE'S RIGHT, BABY.

26:00.226 --> 26:02.762
WELL, IT'S TOO LATE.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.797
WE ALREADY DONE IT.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.766
WE'LL GET IT
ANNULLED.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.268
( scoffs )
WE AIN'T CATHOLIC, MAMA.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.337
HE'S MORE THAN
TWICE YOUR AGE!

26:11.437 --> 26:14.540
- THIS HAS GOT
TO BE AGAINST SOME LAW.
- I DON'T KNOW, HONEY.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.342
FELIX, DO SOMETHING!

26:16.442 --> 26:18.277
AIN'T NOTHING
TO BE DONE.

26:18.377 --> 26:20.680
YOU ARE USELESS!

26:24.651 --> 26:27.219
I'M SURE
HE SWEET-TALKED YOU,
BABY.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.955
HE'S REAL GOOD AT THAT.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.957
HE'S GOT
A WICKED SILVER TONGUE

26:31.057 --> 26:33.192
AND HE KNOWS HOW
TO MAKE A WOMAN FEEL GOOD.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.427
YOU'RE JUST
JEALOUS, MAMA.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.263
JEALOUS?

26:37.363 --> 26:40.066
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.235
BECAUSE HE WANTS ME
AND NOT YOU.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.140
IS THAT WHY
YOU DID THIS, GIRL?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.376
MAYBE I LOVE HIM!

26:50.476 --> 26:52.044
AND HE LOVES ME.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.046
SO WHY SHOULDN'T WE
GET MARRIED THEN?

26:54.146 --> 26:57.784
- THAT AIN'T ENOUGH.
- WELL, IT'S ENOUGH FOR ME.

27:05.591 --> 27:08.194
BYE, DADDY.

27:08.294 --> 27:09.829
OH YEAH,
I ALMOST FORGOT.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.598
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO DO THE KOOTCH.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.334
JONESY DON'T WANT ME
DANCING NO MORE.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.170
OH, CRAP.

27:19.906 --> 27:22.341
"AIN'T NOTHING
TO BE DONE."

27:33.119 --> 27:36.756
TWO RIDES.
THEN TAKE THEM OFF.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.984
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

28:06.152 --> 28:09.188
I MEAN WHY AREN'T YOU
INSIDE WORKING?

28:12.558 --> 28:14.360
RUTHIE!

28:14.460 --> 28:16.662
COME ONE, COME ALL,
STEP RIGHT UP,

28:16.763 --> 28:19.531
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
SEE ROLLO THE RUBBERBOY.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.868
DAMN IT.

28:22.735 --> 28:24.370
JASPER!

28:24.470 --> 28:26.839
GET OVER HERE!

28:28.875 --> 28:31.277
I WANT YOU TURNING THE TIP
ON THE WRASSLING SHOW.

28:31.377 --> 28:35.181
SHUT DOWN THAT SINGLE-O
AND MOVE ROLLO OVER
TO THE TEN-IN-ONE.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.752
- HE AIN'T
GONNA BE HAPPY.
- YEAH?

28:39.852 --> 28:43.722
TELL HIM
IT COMES STRAIGHT DOWN
FROM MANAGEMENT.

29:00.239 --> 29:00.973
RUTHIE?

29:01.073 --> 29:03.409
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON?

29:13.485 --> 29:15.121
I CAN'T.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.124
CAN'T WHAT?

29:25.497 --> 29:28.868
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- I CAN'T GO OUT THERE.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.871
WHY NOT?

29:32.538 --> 29:35.774
YOU SICK OR SOMETHING?

29:35.875 --> 29:39.545
YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT
I TOLD YOU I HAD A DATE
WITH SKEETER LEWIS?

29:39.645 --> 29:42.548
- YEAH?
- WELL, I DID!

29:42.648 --> 29:45.251
I SAW HIM.

29:45.351 --> 29:49.288
- RUTHIE,
SKEETER LEWIS IS--
- DEAD, I KNOW!

29:50.189 --> 29:52.825
BUT I'M TELLING YOU
I SAW HIM.

29:52.925 --> 29:55.261
AND A WHOLE LOT
OF OTHERS SINCE.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.866
DEAD FOLKS.

29:59.966 --> 30:03.870
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU'VE GOT THE SIGHT?

30:03.970 --> 30:07.006
AT LEAST SINCE
I GOT SNAKEBIT, I DO.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.776
WE COULD
WORK SOMETHING UP.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.211
OH, FOR PETE'S SAKE,
SAMSON!

30:12.311 --> 30:14.313
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN WORKING UP AN ACT!

30:14.413 --> 30:16.849
I JUST WANT IT TO STOP!

30:16.949 --> 30:19.051
I THOUGHT
I WAS DOING BETTER.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.121
I HAVEN'T SEEN NOTHING
FOR A WHILE.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.657
THEN LAST NIGHT...

30:25.757 --> 30:29.461
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I SAW SCUDDER.

30:29.561 --> 30:31.263
HACK SCUDDER?

30:31.363 --> 30:34.333
STUMBLING THROUGH THE MIDWAY
LIKE A BOURBON STREET RUMMY.

30:34.433 --> 30:40.272
AND THIS OTHER ONE,
HE COME AND HE SHOVE HIM
INTO A CAR.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.608
A CAR!

30:42.708 --> 30:44.643
THEY GOT CARS!

30:44.743 --> 30:46.812
RUTHIE, HACK SCUDDER
ISN'T DEAD.

30:46.913 --> 30:49.448
HE WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.551
THAT WAS HIM YOU SAW.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.221
IT WAS?

30:56.655 --> 30:59.325
( sighs )
THANK GOD.

30:59.425 --> 31:04.863
RUTHIE, I NEED YOU
TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT
FELLA YOU SEEN,

31:04.964 --> 31:07.433
THE ONE THROWING HACK
IN THE CAR,

31:07.533 --> 31:10.937
RIGHT DOWN
TO THE QUICK.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.609
LET'S GO.

31:19.912 --> 31:22.348
HEY THERE, JONES!

31:22.448 --> 31:24.250
HEY.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.687
THOUGHT I'D COME BY
AND SAY CONGRATULATIONS.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.023
THANKS.

31:38.364 --> 31:41.100
OH, LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT A CUSTOMER.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.071
LET'S GO, CHILDREN.

31:45.171 --> 31:48.207
- TAKE IT OVER.
- Roustie: YOU GOT IT,
JONESY.

31:51.710 --> 31:55.614
( chuckling )
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
PART OF THE FAMILY NOW.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.251
YEAH, I SUPPOSE.

31:59.351 --> 32:03.389
YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND
YOU DON'T LIKE LIBBY'S
LINE OF WORK.

32:03.489 --> 32:05.524
YEAH. SORRY.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.627
NOTHING TO BE SORRY ABOUT.
THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

32:08.727 --> 32:10.429
NO, IT TAKES, UH,

32:10.529 --> 32:13.032
I TELL YOU IT TAKES
A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN.

32:13.132 --> 32:17.936
FORTITUDE. YOU KNOW?

32:18.037 --> 32:21.173
IT'S NOT EASY TURNING
YOUR WIFE OUT EVERY NIGHT

32:21.273 --> 32:25.011
AND EXPECTING HER
TO COME BACK.

32:25.111 --> 32:27.246
- YEAH, I'LL BET.
- YOU KNOW I WAS THINKING,

32:27.346 --> 32:30.849
AND RITA SUE AND I
WERE THINKING IT
WOULD BE AWFUL NICE

32:30.949 --> 32:34.853
IF ALL FOUR OF US,
YOU AND ME AND, UH,
LIBBY,

32:34.953 --> 32:37.156
- AND, UH...
- RITA SUE.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.191
YEAH, YEAH,
AND RITA SUE--
ANYHOW,

32:39.291 --> 32:43.495
WE SHOULD
ALL GET TOGETHER,
HAVE A FAMILY SUPPER.

32:43.595 --> 32:48.300
WHAT DO SAY?
ABOUT 8:00,
BEHIND THE KOOTCH?

32:51.603 --> 32:54.106
SURE, I GUESS.

32:54.206 --> 32:56.975
THAT WOULD BE GREAT!
THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC!

32:57.076 --> 32:59.311
GOOD. OKAY, THEN.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.813
OH. YOU KNOW,
HEY, JONES,

33:01.913 --> 33:03.449
COULD YOU DO ME
A FAVOR.

33:03.549 --> 33:06.952
DON'T GO CALLING
RITA SUE "MOTHER."

33:07.053 --> 33:09.655
AT LEAST NOT JUST YET.

33:09.755 --> 33:12.058
I HADN'T PLANNED ON IT.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.638
ONE LUMP OR TWO?

33:26.738 --> 33:29.675
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THIS MUCH TROUBLE.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.412
TWO.

33:35.114 --> 33:37.349
I FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.884
THAT'S GOOD.

33:38.984 --> 33:42.288
YOU HAVE
ANY MORE FITS?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.392
NOT THAT I REMEMBER.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.428
YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD BE HAVING THEM
AND NOT BE REMEMBERING.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.298
I MEAN, LIKE,
WHEN YOU'RE ALONE

33:52.398 --> 33:56.435
AND THERE'S
NOBODY AROUND TO OBSERVE
ANY PECULIAR BEHAVIOR.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.837
WELL, THAT AIN'T EXACTLY
COMFORTING, IS IT?

33:58.937 --> 34:00.306
OH, I KNOW.
I KNOW.

34:00.406 --> 34:02.040
IT'S DOWNRIGHT
TERRIFYING.

34:02.141 --> 34:05.111
YOU COULD GET UP
AND WANDER OUT
INTO THE ROAD,

34:05.211 --> 34:08.013
AND GET RUNNED OVER
BY A BUS OR SOMETHING.

34:08.114 --> 34:11.850
MAYBE YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO STAY WITH YOU,

34:11.950 --> 34:14.052
DAY AND NIGHT.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.422
I GOT TO GET BACK
TO MY BALLY.

34:17.223 --> 34:19.091
OH, RUTHIE...

34:19.191 --> 34:21.293
RUTHIE, I--

34:23.695 --> 34:26.132
DAMN IT.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.441
( barking )

34:58.730 --> 35:00.566
( radio playing music )

35:00.666 --> 35:02.768
( Stroud singing with radio )
* I'M IN HEAVEN

35:02.868 --> 35:07.573
* AND THE CARES
THAT HUNG AROUND ME
THROUGH THE WEEK... *

35:07.673 --> 35:09.275
LINCOLN HIGHWAY.

35:09.375 --> 35:13.579
* SEEM TO VANISH LIKE
A GAMBLER'S LUCKY STREAK *

35:13.679 --> 35:17.449
Man on radio:
* When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek... *

35:17.549 --> 35:20.186
( panting )

35:20.286 --> 35:23.622
- ( horn honks )
- JESUS! CRAZY FATHEAD!

35:34.065 --> 35:36.402
JEEPERS.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.817
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
- Justin: NOTHING.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.752
THERE WAS JUST
THE PAIN.

35:53.852 --> 35:57.122
MAY I SEE?

35:57.223 --> 36:00.158
MY FLESH IS
BURNED AND SCARRED.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.705
GOOD LORD.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.710
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

36:20.612 --> 36:24.283
YOUR ENEMY HAS
RECEIVED HIS BOON.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.553
- NO.
- YES.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.689
BUT WHAT CONCERNS
ME MORE IS

36:30.789 --> 36:33.925
THIS BUSINESS YOU MENTIONED
WITH THE KNIFE.

36:35.261 --> 36:38.330
"ANOINTED DAGGER,
PLUNGE THEE DEEP!"

36:41.367 --> 36:46.472
- ANOINTED?
- INFUSED WITH
AVATARIC BLOOD.

36:48.073 --> 36:50.108
IF HE HAS IT
IN HIS POSSESSION,

36:50.208 --> 36:52.478
ALONG WITH HIS BOON,

36:52.578 --> 36:55.347
HE NOT ONLY HAS
THE STRENGTH,

36:55.447 --> 36:59.217
BUT THE MEANS
TO DESTROY YOU.

37:00.286 --> 37:02.288
HAVE YOU LOCATED SCUDDER?

37:02.388 --> 37:05.824
YES.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.494
WHEN HE ARRIVES,
CALL ME.

37:08.594 --> 37:13.865
HE AND I HAVE SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.801
PERHAPS.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.969
PLEASE?

37:19.070 --> 37:21.440
PERHAPS.

37:26.412 --> 37:30.649
THANK YOU FOR COMING BY
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.

37:33.719 --> 37:37.323
HELL, LIB,
IT WASN'T LIKE I COULD
JUST PUT HIM OFF.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.891
- WHY NOT?
- HE COME TO ME.

37:39.991 --> 37:41.660
IT WOULD HAVE
LOOKED BAD.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.095
NOT NELY AS BAD
AS YOU SHOWING UP
WITHOUT ME.

37:44.195 --> 37:45.964
COME ON, LIB.
IT'S JUST SUPPER.

37:46.064 --> 37:47.299
IT AIN'T JUST SUPPER.

37:47.399 --> 37:49.100
THEY'RE TRYING
TO WORK SOMETHING.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.303
WHY YOU GOT TO BE
SO SUSPICIOUS?

37:51.403 --> 37:54.840
COME ON.
IT'LL BE OKAY.

38:03.449 --> 38:05.951
THE S-S--
THE S-S--

38:09.287 --> 38:11.323
SO...

38:11.423 --> 38:14.893
YOU ALL THINKING
ABOUT SETTLING DOWN?

38:14.993 --> 38:17.463
MAYBE BUYING
A LITTLE BUNGALOW?

38:18.797 --> 38:21.767
NEVER REALLY
TALKED ABOUT IT.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.736
KIDS?

38:24.836 --> 38:28.374
HAVEN'T REALLY
TALKED ABOUT THAT
NEITHER.

38:28.474 --> 38:31.443
MY OH MY,
WELL, YOU TWO LOVEBIRDS

38:31.543 --> 38:34.346
HAVEN'T DONE MUCH TALKING
AT ALL, HAVE YOU?

38:34.446 --> 38:37.716
Stumpy:
YOU KNOW,
IT SURE IS A SHAME.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.686
YOU KNOW, IT'D BE NICE
IF YOU TWO COULD GET OFF
TO A NICE START.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.755
- A LITTLE
EXTRA MONEY, WHATNOT.
- FORGET IT, DADDY.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.692
WELL, NO.
I'M JUST SAYING THAT--

38:52.431 --> 38:56.668
SO YOU WANNA TELL US
WHAT'S WRONG WITH BEING
MARRIED TO A DANCER?

38:56.768 --> 38:59.237
IT AIN'T THE DANCING
I GOT TRUCK WITH.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.208
OH NO. I'M SURE IT'S JUST
THE FUCKING PART THAT'S GOT
YOUR KNICKERS IN A BUNCH.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.243
- Stumpy: RITA.
- DON'T YOU "RITA" ME!

39:05.343 --> 39:06.945
THIS IS
A FAMILY PROBLEM

39:07.045 --> 39:09.180
AND A SIX-BIT RING
DON'T MAKE HIM FAMILY!

39:09.280 --> 39:10.882
I AIN'T GONNA
LISTEN TO THIS.

39:10.982 --> 39:12.918
YOU SIT
THE HELL DOWN!

39:15.654 --> 39:18.123
WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE,
COWBOY.

39:18.223 --> 39:24.630
STUMPY HAS DUG HIMSELF
A HOLE TO THE TUNE OF $833.

39:27.599 --> 39:30.836
- THAT AIN'T MY PROBLEM.
- Rita Sue: OH YEAH, IT IS.

39:30.936 --> 39:34.105
BECAUSE JUST WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA SAY TO YOUR BLUSHING
LITTLE BRIDE HERE

39:34.205 --> 39:38.677
WHEN THE GORILLA HE OWES
IT TO CARVES HER DADDY UP
LIKE A RIPE TOM-TURKEY?

39:38.777 --> 39:41.413
THAT AIN'T FAIR.
HE'S THE ONE WHO GOT
HISSELF INTO IT.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.248
I DON'T SEE WHY LIBBY
SHOULD HAVE TO BAIL HIM OUT.

39:43.348 --> 39:45.884
BECAUSE WE'RE FAMILY,
AND FAMILIES RISE UP
TOGETHER

39:45.984 --> 39:48.854
AND THEY
FALL DOWN TOGETHER.
BUT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW

39:48.954 --> 39:51.857
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT,
MR. ALL-BY-YOUR-DAMN-SELF!

39:51.957 --> 39:53.992
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE
MY CREW WATCHING MY WIFE

39:54.092 --> 39:57.028
DANCING NAKED
FOR A NICKEL A THROW,
AND THAT'S IT!

39:57.128 --> 39:59.598
- COME ON.
- YOU CAN'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO!

39:59.698 --> 40:01.600
Rita Sue:
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT!

40:01.700 --> 40:04.436
AND YOU CAN'T NEITHER!

40:05.571 --> 40:10.476
Y'ALL MAKE ME SICK,
THE BUNCH OF YOU.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.377
TALKING ABOUT ME
LIKE I'M NOT EVEN A PERSON,

40:12.478 --> 40:14.245
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF LIVESTOCK

40:14.345 --> 40:17.248
YOU CAN BUY AND SELL
AND TRADE.

40:17.348 --> 40:20.051
WELL IT AIN'T
THAT WAY, DAMN IT!

40:20.151 --> 40:23.254
- HONEY, WE NEVER SAID YOU'RE--
- Libby: SHUT UP!

40:23.354 --> 40:25.090
I'M GONNA DANCE
THE KOOTCH.

40:25.190 --> 40:28.226
- LIBBY--
- JUST UNTIL WE PAY OFF
WHAT HE OWES.

40:28.326 --> 40:32.030
AND THEN I AM
RETIRED PERMANENT.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.566
AND NO BLOW-OFFS
AND NO MORE TURNING TRICKS.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.267
I AM DONE WITH THAT!

40:36.367 --> 40:39.270
NOW THAT'S THE WAY
IT'S GONNA BE.

40:39.370 --> 40:42.407
AND IF ANY OF YOU
DON'T LIKE IT,

40:42.508 --> 40:47.646
Y'ALL CAN TAKE A FLYING FUCK
AT THE MAN IN THE MOON!

40:57.422 --> 40:59.691
WE GOT PIE.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.963
HAWKINS?

41:50.108 --> 41:51.743
Bert:
HEY, STITCH.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.012
I DON'T ANSWER
TO THAT HANDLE NO MORE.

41:54.112 --> 41:58.049
YEAH?
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO CALL YOU?

41:58.149 --> 42:00.185
"BOSS" IS FINE.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.121
"SIR" IS BETTER.

42:03.221 --> 42:04.923
OH.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.926
WELL, SIR...

42:11.429 --> 42:13.565
IF I WAS YOU,

42:13.665 --> 42:16.167
I'D STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM MY WIFE.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.607
IF I WAS YOU,

42:21.707 --> 42:25.210
I WOULD TELL YOUR WIFE
TO STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME.

42:26.177 --> 42:28.647
NOW GET.

42:36.822 --> 42:39.557
- ( metal crashes )
- ( woman screaming )

42:39.658 --> 42:41.993
( shouting, screaming )

42:49.534 --> 42:51.302
CLEAR THE WAY!
KEVIN, LOCK THAT DOWN!

42:51.402 --> 42:55.040
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I JUST TURNED AROUND
AND ONE OF THE CARS FELL.

43:04.282 --> 43:07.485
Lila:
OUT OF MY WAY.
LET ME THROUGH PLEASE.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.254
( men shouting )

43:09.354 --> 43:11.657
Jones:
CLEAR THE WAY!

43:11.757 --> 43:13.659
NOW YOU TWO,
HOLD STILL!

43:13.759 --> 43:15.694
- JUST HOLD STILL!
- Woman: THAT'S THE ONE!

43:15.794 --> 43:19.698
THAT'S THE ONE
I SAW DRINKING!

43:19.798 --> 43:22.167
ALL RIGHT,
GET THOSE GUYS
OUT OF HERE!

43:25.003 --> 43:28.573
BRING THAT LADDER
OVER HERE!

43:28.674 --> 43:32.277
JUST SIT TIGHT.
WE'LL GET YOU TAKEN
CARE OF.

43:33.712 --> 43:35.546
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

43:35.647 --> 43:38.817
FIND THE NEAREST PHONE
AND CALL A HOSPITAL!

43:38.917 --> 43:41.286
( shuddering, clanking )

43:42.587 --> 43:44.956
( screaming )

44:10.415 --> 44:14.319
Woman 2:
PLEASE GOD, TAKE ME
NOT MY SON.

44:15.721 --> 44:18.556
PLEASE, GOD, TAKE ME
NOT MY SON.

44:18.656 --> 44:22.060
PLEASE, GOD, TAKE ME
NOT MY SON.

44:24.129 --> 44:28.633
PLEASE, GOD, TAKE ME
NOT MY SON.

44:28.734 --> 44:33.104
PLEASE, GOD, TAKE ME
NOT MY SON.

44:33.204 --> 44:36.174
PLEASE, GOD, TAKE ME
NOT MY SON...

44:42.513 --> 44:46.384
PLEASE, GOD, TAKE ME,
NOT MY SON.

44:54.592 --> 44:57.228
YES.

45:31.863 --> 45:34.299
( inhales )
OW, MAMA.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.401
MAMA!

45:36.501 --> 45:37.969
MAMA!

45:38.069 --> 45:38.937
NO!

45:39.037 --> 45:41.472
CAN I GET SOME HELP
OVER HERE!

45:45.676 --> 45:48.213
DADDY'S GOT YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

45:56.487 --> 45:58.756
Roustie:
EASE IT DOWN!

46:00.391 --> 46:02.994
Samson:
COME ON, YOU BIRDS,
GET THE LEAD OUT!

46:03.094 --> 46:07.398
JONES, STOP STANDING AROUND
WITH YOUR FACE HANGING OUT!

46:07.498 --> 46:10.001
WE'VE GOT TRACK TO MAKE!

46:13.238 --> 46:15.240
DUTCH! SLIM!

46:15.340 --> 46:18.176
BREAK THIS BITCH DOWN.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.190
WHAT THE HELL?

46:53.644 --> 46:56.047
Radio:
* Love me or leave me

46:56.147 --> 46:58.850
* Let me be lonely

46:58.950 --> 47:01.552
* You only need me

47:01.652 --> 47:03.688
* And I love you more

47:03.788 --> 47:06.224
* I'd rather be lonely

47:06.324 --> 47:11.496
* Than happy
with somebody else *

47:14.399 --> 47:16.701
* You might find
the nighttime *

47:16.801 --> 47:19.004
* Is the right time
for kissing *

47:19.104 --> 47:23.942
* The nighttime is my time
for just reminiscing *

47:24.042 --> 47:27.045
* Regretting...

48:29.207 --> 48:31.642
I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FRIEND.

48:31.742 --> 48:34.479
( wind roaring by )

48:39.884 --> 48:42.153
IT WAS THE BEST
I COULD DO.

48:45.023 --> 48:47.658
I'LL HELP YOU.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.928
BUT IT'S GONNA HAVE
TO BE A DIFFERENT DEAL
THAN WITH HIM.

48:52.130 --> 48:54.365
NO MORE SECRETS.

48:54.465 --> 48:56.534
NO MORE LIES.

48:58.336 --> 49:00.505
I DON'T LIE.

49:11.182 --> 49:13.918
RUTHIE SEEN SCUDDER
RUNNING OUT OF HERE.

49:14.019 --> 49:17.288
HE GOT GRABBED
BY THAT BALD-HEADED FELLA.

49:17.388 --> 49:19.190
AW, HELL.

49:19.290 --> 49:20.658
WHAT?

49:20.758 --> 49:23.128
HE'S TAKING HIM BACK
TO THE PREACHER.

49:24.595 --> 49:25.997
DAMN IT!

49:26.097 --> 49:28.066
HE'S GOT A CAR
AND A FULL DAY'S LEAD
ON US.

49:28.166 --> 49:31.002
AIN'T NO CATCHING UP
TO THAT.

49:31.102 --> 49:34.005
WE AIN'T EVEN STARTED,
WE ALREADY LOST.

49:34.105 --> 49:36.141
WELL, I GOT GASOLINE
AND RUBBER--

49:36.241 --> 49:39.710
AND A FOUR-BIT WAGER
SAYS WE HAVEN'T.

49:44.782 --> 49:47.152
FIFTY CENTS.

49:48.153 --> 49:50.488
IRON MONEY.

49:51.222 --> 49:52.757
( engine idling )

49:52.857 --> 49:55.693
HEY, BONE TOP,
KILL THOSE LIGHTS!

49:55.793 --> 49:59.497
WE DRIVE BY MOONLIGHT
TILL WE CROSS THE STATE LINE.

49:59.597 --> 50:01.866
KILL THE LIGHTS.

50:01.966 --> 50:03.268
KILL YOUR LIGHTS.

50:03.368 --> 50:06.071
- DON'T SPARE THE HORSES!
- OKAY.

50:11.542 --> 50:13.178
IS EVERYBODY READY?

50:13.278 --> 50:17.248
IF THEY AIN'T,
THEY CAN STAY BEHIND
AND WAIT FOR THE MOB.

50:18.516 --> 50:20.651
WHERE TO?

50:20.751 --> 50:22.487
WEST.

50:22.587 --> 50:25.056
ABRAHAM LINCOLN HIGHWAY,

50:25.156 --> 50:28.659
AS FAR AND AS FAST
AS YOU CAN PUT US THERE.

50:29.660 --> 50:32.197
I GOT SILVER RIDING ON IT.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.804
( engine revving )

52:21.939 --> 52:24.242
( sighs )

52:36.153 --> 52:39.190
( theme music playing )
