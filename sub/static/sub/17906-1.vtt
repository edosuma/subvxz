01:36.445 --> 01:38.153
Outerspace.

01:38.864 --> 01:41.438
Limitless and timeless.

01:42.285 --> 01:47.031
Filled with cosmic explosions
and endless turbulence.

01:47.207 --> 01:50.707
An infinite playground
for that occasional blazing visitor,

01:50.878 --> 01:52.752
the comet.

01:54.632 --> 01:57.337
At first comets terrified man.

01:57.510 --> 02:01.342
He thought they were signals
of impending catastrophe.

02:01.515 --> 02:04.884
But he got used to them
and he gave names to them

02:05.060 --> 02:08.180
and waited for them
to drop by like old friends.

02:08.354 --> 02:10.977
This one has come from behind the sun,

02:11.150 --> 02:15.100
moving across the heavens
at 108.000 miles an hour,

02:15.280 --> 02:18.863
and has never before
been seen by man.

02:31.006 --> 02:32.999
The asteroid belt.

02:33.926 --> 02:37.010
A vast junkyard
of metal and rock orbiting the sun

02:37.179 --> 02:39.717
between Jupiter and Mars.

02:40.808 --> 02:43.264
Thousands of fragments,

02:43.436 --> 02:45.725
some as small as a fist

02:45.897 --> 02:48.649
some as large as a city.

02:48.817 --> 02:52.946
And amongst these Orpheus.

02:53.114 --> 02:57.741
Twenty mlles in diameter and undisturbed
for countless generations...

02:59.788 --> 03:02.077
...until now.

04:35.269 --> 04:36.929
Give me the horn.

04:39.357 --> 04:40.981
What do you want?

04:41.150 --> 04:44.068
- Is Dr Paul Bradley aboard?
- Who's asking?

04:44.237 --> 04:47.523
I've got orders from NASA
to bring in Dr Paul Bradley.

04:47.699 --> 04:50.238
Is he aboard? This is an emergency.

04:50.411 --> 04:52.867
So's this. We're trying to win a race.

04:53.039 --> 04:56.123
We're going to have
to cut across your bow.

04:57.502 --> 04:59.709
All right goddammit. We're coming in.

05:08.639 --> 05:12.472
Mr Sherwood told me to get you off
the boat and on your way to Houston.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.518
There's a special jet for you.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.638
- You would've cut across my bow?
- Yes, sir.

05:19.234 --> 05:20.645
I would've rammed you.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.070
And gone straight to the bottom, sir.

05:43.428 --> 05:46.346
Don't go away. I could be right back.

05:51.937 --> 05:54.511
Dr Bradley,
it's good to see you again.

05:54.691 --> 05:56.648
Good to see you again.

05:56.818 --> 05:58.609
- You owe me $10.
- I do?

05:58.778 --> 06:02.907
- I got my handicap down to 12.
- No wonder it's good to see me again.

06:03.075 --> 06:05.317
- Yes?
- Bradley's here.

06:05.494 --> 06:07.653
Good. Send him in.

06:10.041 --> 06:12.497
It's yours. Mr Sherwood..

06:20.511 --> 06:24.212
Oh, good to see you. Come in, come in.

06:24.390 --> 06:26.513
- Sorry to do this to you.
- Not at all.

06:28.228 --> 06:31.893
Yes, I did that I called Helen
and asked her to send your clothes.

06:32.065 --> 06:33.524
Hello? Mr Sherwood.'s office.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.686
I, uh...

06:39.032 --> 06:41.238
I didn't know that you and she were...

06:41.409 --> 06:44.613
- You've met General Easton.
- Once, in Washington.

06:44.788 --> 06:47.493
- Good of you to come.
- Sam Mason, CAP commander.

06:47.666 --> 06:49.873
Peter Watson, our flight director.

06:50.044 --> 06:52.915
Put that down
and let me fix you a small Scotch.

06:53.089 --> 06:54.880
A large one.

06:55.049 --> 06:57.754
- Good.
- We could all use one, I think.

06:57.928 --> 06:59.967
Why don't we sit around the table?

07:00.138 --> 07:02.178
Take your coat off.

07:06.938 --> 07:09.345
- How big is your boat?
- Fifty-two feet

07:11.401 --> 07:15.066
An awful lot's been happening here,
Paul. And none of it good.

07:15.238 --> 07:18.442
Harry, I left NASA five years ago.

07:18.617 --> 07:20.859
- Why am I back?
- Let me tell you.

07:21.037 --> 07:22.780
Gentlemen, help yourselves.

07:22.955 --> 07:27.784
Seven days ago, Palomar Observatory
reported the discovery of a new comet.

07:27.961 --> 07:29.290
- General.
- Thank you.

07:29.463 --> 07:32.630
Nothing unusual in that
They spot nine or ten every year,

07:32.800 --> 07:35.256
either themselves
or other observatories.

07:35.428 --> 07:38.963
But... it's where this one
seemed to be going.

07:39.140 --> 07:42.225
- The asteroid belt
- Go on.

07:42.394 --> 07:47.021
When they called me, it was a couple
of hundred thousand miles from the belt.

07:47.191 --> 07:50.525
Challenger ll, our space probe to Mars,
was in the vicinity.

07:50.695 --> 07:54.360
General Easton's son,
Tom, was commanding.

07:54.532 --> 07:56.608
We got in touch with them,

07:56.785 --> 07:58.493
and then we...

08:00.622 --> 08:02.200
I...

08:02.374 --> 08:04.284
...changed their programme.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.867
That was last Friday.

08:36.828 --> 08:39.664
Challenger II,
do you read me?

08:39.832 --> 08:41.291
We read you.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.951
How do you feel
about making a slight detour?

08:44.129 --> 08:47.333
Anything to break the monotony.
What do you call slight?

08:47.508 --> 08:49.880
Two days, four hours and 32 minutes.

08:50.052 --> 08:52.045
What happens to our schedule?

08:52.221 --> 08:55.887
Don't concern yourself, Tom.
We'll take care of everything.

08:56.059 --> 08:58.729
- Mars will have to wait.
- Whatever you say.

08:58.895 --> 09:01.565
- Where are we going?
- The asteroid belt

09:01.732 --> 09:04.899
- What for?
- A Comet's about to go through it.

09:05.069 --> 09:08.355
- They go through all the time.
- It's a first for this one.

09:08.531 --> 09:12.280
It was wrenched out of orbit
by Jupiter's gravitational pull.

09:12.452 --> 09:16.320
- How big is this comet?
- 480 kilometres in diameter,

09:16.498 --> 09:20.627
which makes its nucleus large enough
to do real damage if it hits anything.

09:20.795 --> 09:24.840
It's headed straight toward Orpheus,
the big one in the centre.

09:25.008 --> 09:26.288
Where do we park?

09:26.468 --> 09:30.596
Park alongside Vesta,
about 25,000 kilometres this side.

09:30.764 --> 09:33.256
You'll be there three hours
before the comet.

09:33.434 --> 09:37.349
We want all the information you can
give us on size and orbital elements.

09:37.522 --> 09:39.764
- Take a few pictures?
- A lot of pictures.

09:39.941 --> 09:44.520
We've already started things down here.
You'll change course in five minutes.

09:45.781 --> 09:48.403
- Is my old man with ya?
- He's here.

09:49.410 --> 09:51.652
- Tell him hello.
- Will do.

09:51.829 --> 09:55.033
As I said before, that was last Friday.

09:55.208 --> 09:58.542
Yesterday, Sunday morning,
at 1100 hours,

09:58.712 --> 10:01.382
they started to pull up alongside Vesta.

10:33.042 --> 10:35.284
- We got it?
- Yes, we've got it

10:35.461 --> 10:37.999
- Can you zoom in on Orpheus for us?
- Can do.

10:51.270 --> 10:52.646
Beautiful.

10:52.814 --> 10:56.266
- Let's have some information.
- I'll take some measurements.

10:56.443 --> 11:00.144
For the next hour and a half,
they read the belt for us.

11:01.156 --> 11:03.730
Then what we were waiting for
finally appeared.

11:11.168 --> 11:13.659
Magnetic field measuring zero.

11:18.968 --> 11:21.424
It'll go straight through like salt.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.141
It's gonna hit it!

11:35.486 --> 11:39.531
- Get away from there.
- It's coming apart in a million pieces!

12:08.606 --> 12:11.062
I don't think I can ever forgive myself.

12:11.777 --> 12:14.232
- I should have figured...
- No guilt Harry.

12:14.405 --> 12:18.106
- We'd all have given the same orders.
- Who knows about this?

12:18.284 --> 12:20.277
Nobody at the moment.

12:21.162 --> 12:24.199
We'll have put out a release
right after this meeting.

12:26.501 --> 12:28.044
Why am I here?

12:28.212 --> 12:32.424
A chunk of Orpheus is heading
towards Earth, a pretty big one.

12:32.591 --> 12:36.257
There are a lot of little pieces
with it and in front of it

12:36.429 --> 12:38.469
It's the big one we're worried about

12:38.640 --> 12:43.468
The figures haven't been worked out,
but six days from now we could be hit.

12:43.645 --> 12:46.979
- We have to be prepared.
- That's why we put Hercules up there.

12:47.149 --> 12:49.023
Will you let me finish?

12:51.946 --> 12:56.194
I've convened a meeting at NASA
headquarters in Washington for tomorrow.

12:56.368 --> 12:59.702
Lucas, Steinberg, Fillmore,
others you know will be there.

13:03.918 --> 13:05.875
I want you to come to that meeting.

13:18.684 --> 13:21.769
- I'll come to your meeting.
- We appreciate it Paul.

13:21.938 --> 13:25.224
I've delayed a flight
You're leaving in one hour.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.604
Up-to-date material on Hercules.
Something to read.

13:28.779 --> 13:30.855
Your hotel room has been booked.

13:31.031 --> 13:33.487
Gladys has your expense arrangements.

13:34.243 --> 13:38.573
Why don't you stick a broom up my arse?
I could sweep the carpet on the way out.

13:38.748 --> 13:41.370
Haven't changed, have you?

13:52.972 --> 13:54.681
See you in the morning.

13:57.728 --> 14:00.978
The Coast Guard  towed
Rob Samuelson to harbour...

14:01.148 --> 14:05.098
Among the other nine who failed
to finish was Dr Peterson's Maverick,

14:05.278 --> 14:08.528
who was disqualified
for crossing the line prior to start.

14:08.698 --> 14:12.032
John Slabin's Mary Bee collided
with Arnold Parker's Swan.

14:12.202 --> 14:14.990
Both suffered
sufficient damage to withdraw.

14:15.164 --> 14:18.118
The big surprise
was Paul Bradley's Blithe Spirit,

14:18.292 --> 14:21.911
which withdrew for no apparent reason
early in the race.

14:22.088 --> 14:24.840
John Dunning
had a running battle with...

14:40.484 --> 14:42.940
- Hello.
- it's late, I wanted to...

14:43.112 --> 14:45.899
Paul. Where are you?
Why aren't you on the boat?

14:46.073 --> 14:47.983
Uh, Washington.

14:48.159 --> 14:52.371
- How are the kids?
- Jimmy's got a cold.

14:52.539 --> 14:56.667
And Julie's bound to get it
and we're still fighting about homework.

14:56.835 --> 14:58.994
Apart from that, they're fine.

14:59.171 --> 15:02.291
- What are you doing in Washington?
- I'm not sure yet

15:02.466 --> 15:04.590
I was phoning
to let you know where I am.

15:04.761 --> 15:06.421
How are you?

15:08.682 --> 15:10.840
Oh... Not bad, you know.

15:15.689 --> 15:18.726
- Paul?
- Tell the kids I love them.

16:17.925 --> 16:21.092
A chunk of Orpheus
is heading towards Earth.

16:21.262 --> 16:24.928
A big one. There are a lot of little
pieces with it and in front of it.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.852
But it's the big one
we're worried about.

16:28.020 --> 16:32.481
The figures haven't been worked out,
but six days from now we could he hit.

18:04.002 --> 18:05.461
Sorry I'm late.

18:06.588 --> 18:08.545
You and everybody else.

18:11.301 --> 18:14.718
- Let me tell you about that
- Either we're in the wrong room,

18:14.889 --> 18:17.214
or a lot of brainpower's lost.

18:17.392 --> 18:19.384
Nobody else is coming.

18:19.561 --> 18:22.396
- Lucas, Fillmore, Steinberg?
- I didn't ask them.

18:22.564 --> 18:24.142
- Why not?
- You know why not

18:24.316 --> 18:26.854
Because we don't need them!

18:27.027 --> 18:29.779
You. You originated Hercules.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.732
Out it out, Paul. I know how you feel.

18:33.910 --> 18:36.580
- Dredging up old...
- I'm dredging up nothing.

18:36.746 --> 18:38.870
- I can taste it right now.
- Now, look

18:39.041 --> 18:41.330
It wasn't my decision
to turn Hercules...

18:41.502 --> 18:43.958
- Into what?
- Will you listen to me?

18:44.130 --> 18:48.424
It wasn't designed as a nuclear weapon,
with 14 warheads pointed at Russia.

18:48.593 --> 18:51.049
- Not only Russia.
- Or China. Whatever else!

18:51.221 --> 18:54.804
Those rockets were supposed
to point outwards, not in!

18:54.975 --> 18:58.594
They were meant to defend us
against the threat we're facing now.

18:58.771 --> 19:00.515
- Didn't I yell at them?
- Yeah.

19:00.690 --> 19:02.517
- Didn't I stand up for you?
- Yes.

19:02.692 --> 19:04.234
Then listen to me.

19:04.402 --> 19:06.478
Will you listen to me?

19:06.655 --> 19:10.404
That meteor's five miles wide
and it's definitely gonna hit us!

19:12.328 --> 19:16.029
It would make a hole big enough
to put the Atlantic in.

19:16.958 --> 19:19.116
Shit Five miles.

19:19.294 --> 19:21.037
Now walk out!

19:23.548 --> 19:25.755
And General Adlon? Isn't he in charge?

19:25.926 --> 19:28.464
Adlon's a good man, technically.

19:28.637 --> 19:31.176
But he's two-dimensional.
You know that.

19:31.349 --> 19:33.757
We've got to find a way
to move him out.

19:33.935 --> 19:38.016
That's problem number one.
Problem number two,

19:38.190 --> 19:41.773
there are about 100 guys
stupid enough to resist using Hercules

19:41.944 --> 19:43.984
because of what
it would mean politically.

19:44.530 --> 19:47.401
- What am I supposed to do?
- Help me ride over them.

19:50.161 --> 19:54.623
OK you son of a bitch. I'll help,
but i want it straight up and down.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.535
You've got my word.

19:56.710 --> 20:01.207
Those rockets have got to be realigned
and we've got exactly five days.

20:59.447 --> 21:03.777
I hope no one has been so foolish
to contact the Russians about all this.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.488
It would be inadvisable...

21:06.663 --> 21:10.708
No one would think of doing that
without your approval, Mr Secretary.

21:10.876 --> 21:14.246
You can be sure they know all
there is to know about the meteor.

21:14.422 --> 21:16.747
They don't know
what we're planning to do.

21:16.925 --> 21:20.045
What we're discussing.
I hope it's still discussion.

21:20.220 --> 21:24.550
General Adlon, I assure you
that no decisions have been made.

21:24.725 --> 21:28.770
That's what this meeting's
been called for, to decide what to do.

21:28.938 --> 21:31.263
You're in charge of Project Hercules.

21:31.441 --> 21:34.110
If the result of this meeting
is to make use...

21:34.277 --> 21:37.611
There's nothing else.
The only thing we've got is Hercules.

21:37.781 --> 21:42.693
Dammit Hercules is not up there either,
as far as anybody but we are concerned.

21:42.870 --> 21:46.654
It's got to stay that way.
We have never admitted to Hercules.

21:46.833 --> 21:49.241
- If we admit to it now...
- We have to!

21:49.419 --> 21:53.002
You can't keep the whole world
in the dark about what's going on.

21:53.173 --> 21:57.254
Once they know that a five-mile hunk
of rock is gonna hit at 30,000 mph,

21:57.428 --> 22:00.465
people will want to know
what we intend to do about it.

22:00.640 --> 22:04.508
You're gonna tell the entire world
we have nuclear rockets out there

22:04.686 --> 22:09.479
in direct contradiction to every
international agreement we've ever made?

22:09.650 --> 22:13.434
That's an invitation to being called
liars and warmongers by every...

22:13.613 --> 22:16.318
It's
international murder if we don't!

22:16.491 --> 22:18.116
What do you want to do?

22:18.284 --> 22:20.906
You want to meet it
with BB guns and slingshots?

22:21.079 --> 22:24.947
Please! Gentlemen!

22:26.961 --> 22:30.211
Dr Bradley, would you please
tell us what would happen

22:30.381 --> 22:31.876
if this meteor struck us?

22:33.969 --> 22:36.804
A massive rock, one mile wide,

22:36.972 --> 22:39.724
travelling at 30,000 miles per hour,

22:39.892 --> 22:43.510
would cause a crater 50 miles across
and five miles deep.

22:44.564 --> 22:47.102
Orpheus is five miles wide.

22:47.275 --> 22:49.731
Its striking force is equal to...

22:50.529 --> 22:53.696
...2,500,000 megatons of TNT.

22:54.783 --> 22:56.990
That is ten orders of magnitude

22:57.161 --> 23:00.079
above the largest earthquake
ever recorded.

23:01.374 --> 23:05.419
It would throw into the
atmosphere five billion tons of earth,

23:05.587 --> 23:08.339
and reduce solar radiation
for decades to come.

23:09.258 --> 23:11.963
It could cause another Ice Age.

23:12.136 --> 23:15.054
What if the thing doesn't hit?
There's some chance.

23:15.223 --> 23:18.260
- Every scientific facility...
- You have been wrong!

23:18.435 --> 23:21.353
You were wrong
to send Challenger II off its course!

23:21.521 --> 23:23.395
I don't have to listen to this!

23:23.565 --> 23:26.104
Please!

23:26.277 --> 23:28.815
You're out of order!

23:28.988 --> 23:32.274
At ease, gentlemen.
Dr Bradley, where are you going?

23:32.450 --> 23:34.075
I need air.

23:34.244 --> 23:38.372
I don't give a damn what Russia says
about America or vice versa.

23:38.540 --> 23:41.826
I told you what's gonna happen
when that meteor hits.

23:42.837 --> 23:44.580
If you think you can prevent it

23:44.756 --> 23:48.291
by burying your heads
under a blanket of shit fine.

23:48.468 --> 23:51.920
If you reach a decision,
I'll be in the bar across the street.

23:55.518 --> 23:58.139
I'll have to discuss this
at the White House.

23:58.312 --> 24:01.896
In time,
because there's damn little time.

24:09.450 --> 24:12.202
We are now
going to replay a recording

24:12.370 --> 24:15.490
of a broadcast made
by them earlier today.

24:15.665 --> 24:20.541
The British Cabinet met to discuss the
announcement by Jodrell Bank Observatory

24:20.712 --> 24:23.797
that a piece of an asteroid
knocked out of orbit by a comet

24:23.966 --> 24:26.291
is on possible collision course
with Earth.

24:26.469 --> 24:30.383
In less than a week, this
giant object could strike our planet,

24:30.557 --> 24:33.511
causing untold damage
and great loss of life.

24:33.685 --> 24:37.683
The Prime Minister is in consultation
with the American President...

24:37.856 --> 24:39.055
Put the game on!

24:39.233 --> 24:42.602
...and volunteered every assistance
the government can give.

24:42.779 --> 24:45.021
We consider it deplorable

24:45.198 --> 24:48.283
that the American people
should he dependent on the BBC

24:48.451 --> 24:52.580
to supply us with facts
that we have a right to know.

24:52.748 --> 24:56.200
I consider it deplorable
I don't have a drink.

24:56.377 --> 24:58.169
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch.

24:58.337 --> 25:00.959
- A large one.
- A large one.

25:01.758 --> 25:03.169
What happened?

25:03.343 --> 25:05.336
They're calling the President.

25:06.263 --> 25:08.055
What if he says no?

25:13.312 --> 25:15.222
A couple of years ago,

25:15.398 --> 25:18.933
my son, Andy, started to complain
about pains in his stomach.

25:19.111 --> 25:22.231
All the junk food kids eat,
I wasn't a bit surprised.

25:23.282 --> 25:25.690
But he kept on complaining.

25:25.868 --> 25:29.154
I had a talk with Miriam
and we decided to take him to a doctor.

25:29.330 --> 25:31.407
Just for an opinion, you understand.

25:34.711 --> 25:37.000
Appendicitis, the doctor said.

25:37.172 --> 25:40.873
Miriam said, "Let's wait till tomorrow.
The pain will go away. "

25:41.969 --> 25:45.837
You know my Miriam. She can't
stand the thought of an operation.

25:47.058 --> 25:50.143
That night when she went to bed,

25:50.312 --> 25:52.352
she cried herself to sleep.

25:53.357 --> 25:56.144
I went and picked him up
and took him to a hospital.

25:56.319 --> 25:59.937
Six hours later his appendix was out,
he was feeling better,

26:00.115 --> 26:03.733
and Miriam... Miriam was all smiles.

26:06.497 --> 26:08.371
You get my point?

26:08.541 --> 26:09.869
Yeah.

26:11.669 --> 26:15.833
How do you sneak me into a position
where I can fire nuclear warheads

26:16.007 --> 26:18.000
without Miriam knowing?

26:18.176 --> 26:20.928
I'll do it,

26:21.096 --> 26:23.219
if I can't do it any other way.

26:23.390 --> 26:25.430
Is there a Mr Sherwood. here?

26:25.601 --> 26:29.302
- Yeah, that's me.
- Telephone, right through there.

26:29.481 --> 26:32.351
Thanks.

26:55.801 --> 27:00.511
Mr Secretary, I'd rather not call back
I'd appreciate it if you held on.

27:00.682 --> 27:04.265
Yes, Dr Bradley is checking out
the information to verify.

27:05.437 --> 27:07.893
Yes, sir, I do think it's urgent.

27:08.065 --> 27:11.066
- No, sir. Paul.
- In a minute.

27:11.235 --> 27:13.275
It's coming up now, sir.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.902
- What do I tell him?
- How good is his health?

27:17.492 --> 27:20.447
- Confirmed?
- Confirmed. Hercules is light.

27:22.706 --> 27:25.992
Mr Secretary, it's been confirmed.

27:26.252 --> 27:29.538
So, what you're telling me is that...

27:29.714 --> 27:32.003
...even if we admit to Hercules

27:33.677 --> 27:38.754
and I give you my permission
to realign the rockets,

27:38.933 --> 27:41.471
we still need more firepower?

27:41.644 --> 27:44.100
More nuclear mega-tonnage?
More rockets?

27:44.272 --> 27:46.265
That's right Mr President.

27:46.441 --> 27:50.653
- Mr Secretary, do we have more rockets?
- Not in space, sir.

27:50.821 --> 27:54.025
What are we supposed to do,
conjure them out of air?

27:55.284 --> 27:59.365
Mr President, would you confirm
what I'm about to say?

27:59.539 --> 28:03.584
The Russians have their own equivalent
of Hercules out in space.

28:03.752 --> 28:06.160
True or not true?

28:07.506 --> 28:09.214
True.

28:11.594 --> 28:15.129
Mr President, we need
the combined power of theirs and ours.

28:15.307 --> 28:18.059
- They'll never admit it
- We'll make them.

28:18.226 --> 28:20.848
- How?
- General Adlon,

28:21.021 --> 28:24.058
for the time being,
until this crisis is resolved,

28:25.485 --> 28:29.150
I am putting Dr Bradley in charge
of Operation Hercules.

28:30.991 --> 28:34.075
I rely on you to give him
every aid and assistance.

28:36.705 --> 28:40.371
- I hope I'm public-spirited enough...
- I'm sure you are.

28:40.543 --> 28:44.790
Listen, I think I have a solution
to this problem.

28:46.007 --> 28:49.293
- Where will you be this evening?
- We're flying to New York.

28:50.387 --> 28:52.925
Make sure you hear
my broadcast at 8.00.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.257
That's all, gentlemen. Thank you.

28:58.730 --> 29:02.016
You'll ask
what steps have been taken

29:02.192 --> 29:08.029
to make sure that this meteor
never comes near the Earth's surface.

29:08.199 --> 29:11.366
I'm happy to tell you that realizing

29:11.536 --> 29:15.035
that such an emergency
as this could arise,

29:15.206 --> 29:17.080
your government,

29:17.250 --> 29:21.331
in collaboration with the best
scientific brains at its disposal,

29:22.757 --> 29:27.086
developed a project
to deal with this emergency.

29:28.513 --> 29:32.511
That project has been named Hercules.

29:33.143 --> 29:34.970
What is Hercules?

29:35.145 --> 29:38.182
Hercules is an armed,
orbiting satellite

29:39.150 --> 29:43.362
its nuclear weaponry
almed toward outerspace.

29:43.530 --> 29:46.103
Right name. Wrong direction.

29:46.283 --> 29:48.691
What can Hercules do?

29:48.869 --> 29:51.277
It can send, at the press of a botton,

29:51.455 --> 29:55.667
enough power to destroy any foreign body

29:55.835 --> 29:58.540
on a collision course with our planet.

29:58.713 --> 30:03.340
But, in this case,
a special circumstance has arisen.

30:04.052 --> 30:08.929
The meteor is of such size and velocity
that even this powerful weapon...

30:11.269 --> 30:13.677
...cannot do the job entirely.

30:14.814 --> 30:20.688
Fortunately, the Russians, with
the same foresight that we possessed,

30:20.863 --> 30:23.021
mounted their own defense weapon.

30:23.199 --> 30:26.449
We do not know what the Russians
have called their weapon,

30:26.619 --> 30:29.704
but we know it exists.

30:29.873 --> 30:35.248
And we are going to ask them to
combine their nuclear power with ours,

30:35.421 --> 30:40.167
so that together we will
be able to deal with the meteor,

30:40.343 --> 30:43.593
to strike it with irresistible force

30:43.763 --> 30:48.805
and to end forever
its potential danger to us all.

30:48.977 --> 30:52.477
I will, myself,
be speaking with the Russians

30:52.648 --> 30:56.064
Immediately after
I finish this broadcast.

30:56.236 --> 30:58.941
- The game is on.
- Good night.

30:59.114 --> 31:01.570
And God bless you.

31:42.704 --> 31:43.949
Hello?

32:30.590 --> 32:34.458
- Do you have a pass for Dr Bradley?
- Good morning, sir.

32:34.637 --> 32:37.757
- General Adlon come in yet?
- Half an hour ago.

32:47.901 --> 32:51.152
- How far down?
- Right next to an old subway station,

32:51.322 --> 32:54.074
a section that runs under the Hudson.

32:54.242 --> 32:58.703
It made it easy for us to bring
the equipment in and it saved millions.

32:58.872 --> 33:02.206
Why not some sensible place,
like Houston?

33:02.376 --> 33:03.835
Mm-mmm.

33:04.003 --> 33:08.582
This has easy access to a total
telecommunications set-up above us.

33:08.758 --> 33:10.300
Nobody in their right minds

33:10.468 --> 33:13.635
would put their most important
emergency striking power

33:13.805 --> 33:15.715
under the busiest city in the world.

33:24.067 --> 33:25.775
This is Dr Bradley.

33:26.486 --> 33:28.313
Can I see your pass, sir?

33:29.698 --> 33:31.607
Would you mind signing it sir?

33:35.955 --> 33:37.283
Thank you.

33:40.460 --> 33:43.663
Command to Internal.

33:43.839 --> 33:47.671
Central Control, call 8-1-2-4.

33:59.272 --> 34:01.431
General Adlon, most impressive.

34:01.608 --> 34:03.352
Thank you. A message for you.

34:03.527 --> 34:07.905
Normally we work with 25, but since it's
an emergency i brought in the full crew.

34:08.074 --> 34:10.744
Good news.
The Russians are coming.

34:10.909 --> 34:15.121
I consider allowing the Russians
to come into this centre a grave error,

34:15.290 --> 34:19.039
which one day the United States
may bitterly regret.

34:19.210 --> 34:21.583
- I'd like to meet the staff.
- Of course.

34:21.755 --> 34:24.840
General, may I use your office
for a moment?

34:25.009 --> 34:26.801
Certainly. This way.

34:26.969 --> 34:30.219
This is our chief technician,
Rolf Manheim.

34:30.389 --> 34:32.099
- Rolf.
- Dr Bradley.

34:32.393 --> 34:36.936
You have been teaching my nephew at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

34:37.063 --> 34:38.393
- Ben Manheim.
- Yes.

34:38.565 --> 34:41.686
He's a bright boy.
He'll be teaching me in a couple years.

34:41.860 --> 34:44.020
All stations give status now.

34:44.197 --> 34:47.234
This is our trajectory analysis officer,
Jan Watkins.

34:47.409 --> 34:49.817
- Hello.
- I suppose you're tied into 1180?

34:49.995 --> 34:53.614
No. At 360,
with a custom-designed memory.

34:53.791 --> 34:57.837
Like I said, I'll be asking you
and your computer a lot of questions.

34:58.004 --> 35:00.792
- We'll give you prompt answers.
- Triple-checked.

35:00.966 --> 35:03.540
My assistant, Alan Marshall.

35:03.719 --> 35:08.465
Dr Bradley, I've got Sir Michael Hughes
from the Jodrell Bank Observatory.

35:08.641 --> 35:10.349
He'd like a word with you.

35:10.518 --> 35:11.894
Excuse me.

35:12.562 --> 35:15.184
I'm Bill Hunter, in charge of tracking.

35:15.357 --> 35:17.184
What else are you linked with?

35:17.359 --> 35:19.815
Hong Kong, Arecibo and New South Wales.

35:23.032 --> 35:26.033
- Good morning, Michael.
- Good evening, Paul.

35:26.953 --> 35:29.492
I didn't expect to see you
until Wimbledon.

35:29.665 --> 35:31.704
Assuming there'll be a Wimbledon.

35:31.875 --> 35:33.334
What have you got?

35:33.502 --> 35:36.503
Expect the first splinters in 24 hours.

35:36.672 --> 35:40.967
Doubtful if we can track them unless
they're in clusters. We'll do our best.

35:41.136 --> 35:44.968
- Anything else?
- No. I just wanted to make contact.

35:45.140 --> 35:48.592
We'll keep in constant touch.
Until then.

35:49.520 --> 35:53.352
Paul, the Russian astrophysicist
you asked for?

35:53.524 --> 35:56.479
- Dr Dubov?
- He's arriving at 7.30 this evening.

36:16.175 --> 36:18.214
Dr Dubov, are we glad to see you here!

36:23.224 --> 36:25.217
Thank you.

36:51.798 --> 36:56.211
Twenty-two, 47, colon, 56 point 55.

37:05.104 --> 37:09.352
He assumes this is an accurate
representation of the satellite.

37:17.827 --> 37:21.077
Or is the direction
of the rocket just accidental?

37:21.247 --> 37:24.414
I am not prepared
to volunteer strategic information.

37:32.301 --> 37:34.294
- Is that what I said?
- Yes, sir.

37:37.891 --> 37:39.848
- Please.
- Thank you.

37:40.018 --> 37:42.509
What striking power does it carry?

37:43.647 --> 37:46.221
I'd prefer you got that
from Dr Bradley.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.230
Good morning.

37:51.406 --> 37:54.740
Fourteen rockets,
each carrying a 100 megaton bomb.

37:57.663 --> 38:01.827
Welcome to New York Dr Dubov.

38:02.001 --> 38:04.753
- Everything in duplicate?
- It's a procedure.

38:04.921 --> 38:07.875
How else do we know we're
being interpreted properly?

38:10.594 --> 38:14.045
I think we could all start
by trusting each other.

38:16.559 --> 38:20.308
Otherwise, what's the point?

38:20.480 --> 38:24.347
If it's a matter of choosing,
I'll take the pretty one.

38:28.238 --> 38:31.857
The pretty one
is Tatiana Nikolaevna Donskaya.

38:32.034 --> 38:33.694
- Did I say it right?
- Very good.

38:33.869 --> 38:36.361
Astrophysicist
and Dr Dubov's English voice.

38:36.539 --> 38:38.081
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

38:38.249 --> 38:40.705
The captain
is General Adlon's Russian voice.

38:40.877 --> 38:41.909
- Sir.
- Hi.

38:42.087 --> 38:46.132
Since it appears we are redundant here,
if you'll excuse us.

38:46.300 --> 38:48.791
Mr Sherwood.,
I'd like to see you outside.

38:50.430 --> 38:52.921
I'll see if I can't calm him down.

38:55.352 --> 38:58.057
He thinks General Adlon
is not pleased to see him.

38:58.230 --> 39:01.433
- I know this is difficult for you...
- Mr Sherwood!

39:01.609 --> 39:04.017
I spoke to the Secretary of Defense,

39:04.195 --> 39:07.362
who seems more aware
of the complexity of the situation.

39:07.532 --> 39:09.988
- But...
- His orders are, and I quote,

39:10.160 --> 39:12.366
"No change in the direction of rockets

39:12.537 --> 39:17.330
until the Russians admit they've got
their own and agree to realign them. "

39:17.501 --> 39:20.040
- Is that understood?
- Look.

39:20.213 --> 39:23.499
Why don't you Xerox
100 copies of that report,

39:23.675 --> 39:26.629
pass them out among
100 guys in Washington,

39:26.803 --> 39:29.377
then organise
100 meetings to discuss it

39:29.556 --> 39:34.385
By that time the meteor will have hit
and we won't have any more problems.

39:44.823 --> 39:46.733
He doesn't mean to criticize,

39:46.909 --> 39:49.827
but you will not find it easy
to hit a meteor

39:49.996 --> 39:52.831
with your warheads
pointing toward the USSR.

39:54.835 --> 39:57.373
We call ours Hercules.
What do you call yours?

40:05.263 --> 40:08.347
How can one give a name
to that which does not exist

40:11.061 --> 40:14.015
Then who put up this thing
called Peter the Great

40:14.857 --> 40:17.348
its warheads pointing
at the United States?

40:26.328 --> 40:28.202
Chinese, perhaps.

40:29.540 --> 40:33.538
Dr Dubov, we've gota slight problem.

40:33.711 --> 40:38.374
If Peter the Great does not exist,
we are out of business.

40:38.550 --> 40:41.468
But if it does exist,

40:41.637 --> 40:45.966
I'd have to know what weapons
it would be carrying...

40:46.142 --> 40:48.265
...where it was...

40:48.436 --> 40:52.351
...and what frequencies we would
have to use to align it with Hercules.

40:57.070 --> 40:59.858
Now, for purposes of discussion only...

41:06.122 --> 41:09.492
He understands
the importance of your questions.

41:13.047 --> 41:16.961
If he had been involved in construction
of such an illegal weapon...

41:22.766 --> 41:26.764
...he could then, of course,
theoretically, answer those questions.

41:29.106 --> 41:32.475
Then would you be prepared,
theoretically, of course...

41:35.113 --> 41:39.111
...to work out the details with me
as to how we link the satellites?

41:45.207 --> 41:47.247
Yes, he would be ready.

41:47.418 --> 41:49.625
Before that,

41:49.796 --> 41:52.714
what would you have designed
your striking power to be?

42:01.934 --> 42:06.312
Sixteen rockets, each carrying
mega-tonnage, the same as your own.

42:07.357 --> 42:10.560
That gives us a billion plus.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.983
Theoretically.

42:17.159 --> 42:21.240
Theoretically.

44:22.758 --> 44:25.675
I give the floor
to the first speaker on my list,

44:25.844 --> 44:27.422
a representative of Canada.

44:27.596 --> 44:31.594
We have information that a
disturbance of earthquake proportions

44:31.768 --> 44:33.926
has occurred somewhere in Siberia.

44:34.103 --> 44:38.184
I believe that all of us here
are aware of that fact.

44:39.610 --> 44:44.687
Would the Russian delegate tell us
what was the cause of the disturbance?

44:48.494 --> 44:52.279
Mr President,
we would like to request a recess

44:52.457 --> 44:55.494
while we consult further
with our government.

45:10.811 --> 45:13.563
At my next mark,
it will be 2300.

45:13.731 --> 45:16.518
- We are in test number 36.
- Good morning.

45:16.692 --> 45:19.860
- Did you get any sleep last night?
- A couple of hours. You?

45:20.030 --> 45:23.363
I played gin rummy and lost.
What's the Russian girl like?

45:23.533 --> 45:26.404
Very nice, very bright and forget it.

45:26.578 --> 45:28.156
I missed you.

45:28.330 --> 45:32.163
...approaching X plus six minutes
on the attitude control test

45:32.335 --> 45:34.624
and all station monitors are green.

45:39.843 --> 45:41.670
With compliments.

45:41.845 --> 45:44.930
I had them strip your bed
and put on some proper sheets.

45:45.099 --> 45:47.637
- That's kind.
- I've got some decent soap,

45:47.810 --> 45:51.595
because using the stuff here
is like washing your hands with a rock.

45:51.773 --> 45:54.893
- Thank you. That's a pretty scarf.
- Thank you.

45:55.068 --> 45:58.853
Will Jim Jackson
report to the security office.

46:06.748 --> 46:09.037
His hours are confused.

46:10.461 --> 46:12.833
- How about you?
- Oh, I'm all right

46:15.091 --> 46:19.041
System analysis team
will review power problems

46:19.220 --> 46:21.925
at 0800 tomorrow in conference room.

46:44.248 --> 46:47.914
- Should I wake him?
- Let him sleep. Have some coffe.

46:48.628 --> 46:53.255
Commands for attitude
control updates programmed in Hercules.

46:55.302 --> 46:56.678
How long have you been with him?

46:56.846 --> 46:59.135
I've known him for ten years.

46:59.307 --> 47:01.679
But I've only worked with him for five.

47:01.851 --> 47:03.891
Why did you choose astrophysics?

47:04.062 --> 47:05.853
- It chose me.
- How?

47:06.022 --> 47:09.606
I was a telephone operator
at a centre for controller flight

47:09.777 --> 47:12.647
in a cosmodrome
by Kannur in Middle Asia.

47:12.822 --> 47:15.906
I knew your language
because when I was a child

47:16.075 --> 47:18.483
my mother kept
giving me books in English

47:18.661 --> 47:21.829
and telling me that one day
I would be grateful to her.

47:21.999 --> 47:23.872
I suppose I am. Would you like one?

47:24.042 --> 47:26.249
No, thanks. Go on.

47:26.420 --> 47:30.370
Then, about ten years ago,
some British scientists came to Russia

47:30.550 --> 47:32.756
to meet with some of our people.

47:32.927 --> 47:36.012
Alexei Serich, our Sleeping Beauty,

47:36.181 --> 47:40.345
needed someone to translate for him,
and they asked me.

47:40.519 --> 47:41.800
His English voice.

47:41.979 --> 47:44.649
When I finished,
he asked me to stay on with him

47:44.816 --> 47:47.817
as interpreter and third assistant.

47:47.986 --> 47:51.355
He was married to Olga Alekseevna then,
his first wife.

47:51.531 --> 47:54.449
- How many's he had?
- He's on his fourth.

47:55.452 --> 47:58.573
He's sleeping alone now,
but just not very often.

47:58.748 --> 48:01.784
You know,
it's very nice talking with you.

48:01.960 --> 48:03.454
Thank you.

48:03.628 --> 48:05.835
We've been talking for almost two days.

48:06.006 --> 48:08.924
No. I've been talking
with you and Dubov.

48:09.093 --> 48:11.299
I mean talking with "you", you.

48:11.470 --> 48:15.800
- Very attractive.
- Thank you, again.

48:15.975 --> 48:18.549
- Then...
- Then?

48:18.728 --> 48:20.970
- Astrophysics.
- Oh!

48:22.107 --> 48:25.393
Well, I realized
that space fascinated me.

48:25.569 --> 48:29.188
Alexei Serich saw this
and he encouraged me.

48:29.365 --> 48:31.572
He arranged for me to go to university.

48:31.743 --> 48:34.661
And when I returned,
I was an astrophysicist.

48:37.583 --> 48:41.248
- That's when I met my husband.
- Your husband?

48:42.088 --> 48:45.837
He was a cosmonaut
We were together for three years.

48:47.135 --> 48:50.053
And then he went
on an exploratory mission,

48:50.222 --> 48:52.214
and he didn't come back.

48:53.392 --> 48:55.800
And now? Is there anyone?

48:57.605 --> 49:00.559
Nothing serious. Not really.

49:00.733 --> 49:04.778
Dr Bradley,
Sir Michael is reporting on the monitor.

49:04.946 --> 49:07.272
There are meteors over Central Europe.

49:08.575 --> 49:11.446
Ah, Paul, the observatory
in Frascati is reporting.

49:11.620 --> 49:15.868
There's a cluster big enough to track
coming in over Italy south of Pisa.

49:16.042 --> 49:19.162
Speed of approach,
15,000 metres per second.

50:00.675 --> 50:04.341
They've burnt up!
The clusters evaporated.

50:04.513 --> 50:06.968
Frascati says that
not one of them got through.

50:07.141 --> 50:11.305
The whole thing's been nothing more
than a gigantic fireworks display.

50:11.479 --> 50:13.935
Thank you. That's the best news yet

50:14.107 --> 50:16.230
We'll try and keep it that way.

50:17.527 --> 50:20.101
Bradley!

50:20.280 --> 50:22.736
I think we can assume
the emergency's over.

50:22.908 --> 50:25.530
This one, and the emergency in general.

50:25.703 --> 50:29.535
It's a pity the world's been sent
into a state of unnecessary panic.

50:29.707 --> 50:33.242
There's your threat,
Dr Bradley, a fireworks display!

50:33.420 --> 50:38.794
Tell this arsehole once and for all,
Orpheus will not burn up. It's too big!

50:38.968 --> 50:41.091
We've got enough to deal with here.

50:41.262 --> 50:44.762
We don't need any
additional aggravation from you!

50:44.933 --> 50:47.803
Not one promise
of calamity has come true.

50:50.856 --> 50:53.394
As far as I'm concerned,
not a single one will!

50:55.444 --> 50:58.280
When common sense is restored

50:58.448 --> 51:03.406
and the President has returned
the control of this centre to me,

51:03.578 --> 51:07.529
I shall return to this centre!

51:38.784 --> 51:42.200
He wishes to telephone
the Russian Embassy in Washington.

52:01.393 --> 52:03.682
The USSR

52:03.854 --> 52:08.433
is not unaware of the seriousness
of this situation.

52:09.735 --> 52:12.061
We have, therefore, decided

52:12.238 --> 52:15.073
to add to the power of Hercules

52:15.241 --> 52:19.655
the considerable power
that we, ourselves, possess.

52:21.206 --> 52:26.248
A satellite, developed before
the United States developed theirs.

52:26.420 --> 52:30.715
But which we designed and constructed

52:30.884 --> 52:35.380
for the purpose of defense
against possible disasters

52:35.556 --> 52:38.094
such as the one confronting us now.

52:38.267 --> 52:40.260
For that purpose only!

52:40.603 --> 52:46.606
The USSR
will always support any exercise,

52:46.693 --> 52:50.228
the primary object of which

52:50.405 --> 52:52.897
is to the benefit of mankind.

53:10.636 --> 53:13.840
- To Peter the Great.
- To the Russian cutting of red tape.

53:14.015 --> 53:17.219
Peter the Great.

53:25.278 --> 53:28.777
Dr Dubov would like to tell you
words he heard from a taxi driver

53:28.948 --> 53:30.740
when he was last in America.

53:32.244 --> 53:34.699
Walk the Dodgers!

55:19.571 --> 55:22.822
Attitude correction complete.
Situation nominal.

56:49.713 --> 56:51.671
This is Goldstone.

56:51.841 --> 56:55.886
We have a realignment interrupt.
Realignment Interrupt. Copy.

56:56.054 --> 56:58.296
Readjustment malfunction.

56:58.473 --> 57:01.759
Deployment latch relay
on rocket three may he hung up.

57:01.935 --> 57:04.261
We have to re-set.
Send back-up command

57:04.438 --> 57:08.519
and update the guidance systems
to account for the delayed firing time.

57:13.448 --> 57:16.200
Co-variance matrix
has been recalculated.

57:16.368 --> 57:20.413
All Hercules
back-up syslems are ready.

58:17.144 --> 58:20.478
Attitude correction complete.
Situation nominal.

58:20.648 --> 58:23.186
We wait till we see
the whites of its eyes.

58:23.359 --> 58:24.818
0700 Sunday.

01:01:08.876 --> 01:01:12.791
lt is eight hours since
a splinter struck the Swiss Alps.

01:01:12.964 --> 01:01:16.548
Only now has the enormity
of what has happened begun to sink in.

01:01:16.719 --> 01:01:19.008
There's never been anything like this.

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:22.929
Avalanches and storms
have destroyed whole villages,

01:01:23.101 --> 01:01:25.426
but nothing on the scale of
what's here.

01:01:25.603 --> 01:01:27.561
Help is coming from all over,

01:01:27.731 --> 01:01:31.349
ambulances, helicopters,
rescue equipment and supplies.

01:01:31.527 --> 01:01:34.943
Dead casualties are being taken
to churches and town halls.

01:01:35.114 --> 01:01:39.243
Those still alive are rushed
to hospitals for resuscitation.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:42.827
So many skiers and holiday-makers
here atthis time of year,

01:01:42.998 --> 01:01:44.955
and many of them are unregistered.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:48.292
There's no way of telling who they are.

01:01:48.462 --> 01:01:50.704
Anyone who has reason to believe

01:01:50.882 --> 01:01:55.129
that friends or relatives have been
in this area during the last weeks

01:01:55.303 --> 01:01:58.388
should go immediately
to the Swiss emergency offices

01:01:58.557 --> 01:02:01.891
that have been opened up
in Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich.

01:02:04.188 --> 01:02:07.889
The tragedy has been heightened
by the loss of 12,000 contestants

01:02:08.067 --> 01:02:13.489
in the cross-country marathon, which
started an hour before the splinter hit.

01:02:16.326 --> 01:02:19.992
The cameraman and crew who shot
this film left the area by helicopter

01:02:20.164 --> 01:02:22.620
only minutes before the disaster.

01:02:22.792 --> 01:02:25.627
In the minds of people everywhere,
the question is,

01:02:25.795 --> 01:02:30.422
where next and what about
the big one due on Sunday,

01:02:30.592 --> 01:02:33.547
closing on Earth
at 30,000 miles an hour?

01:02:34.263 --> 01:02:35.674
We can only hope,

01:02:35.848 --> 01:02:39.099
as the President of the United States
has assured us,

01:02:39.269 --> 01:02:41.475
that we are in safe hands.

01:02:41.646 --> 01:02:43.520
This is Osman Ragheb in Zurich,

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:46.395
returning you
to the ABC Studios in New York.

01:02:48.487 --> 01:02:50.610
My God.

01:02:58.206 --> 01:03:00.745
As simply as you can, Mr Sherwood.,

01:03:00.918 --> 01:03:03.041
what's the procedure now?

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:09.626
The satellites are orbiting
with Earth 22,500 miles out in space.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.379
Since they are in different orbits,

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:15.308
and in order for them
to reach the target together,

01:03:15.476 --> 01:03:18.181
they will have to be fired
at different times.

01:03:19.063 --> 01:03:21.388
Peter the Great first,

01:03:21.566 --> 01:03:24.022
and then 40 minutes later, Hercules.

01:03:25.028 --> 01:03:27.400
Two hours after that, they will explode

01:03:27.572 --> 01:03:30.443
at a designated distance
from the target.

01:03:32.495 --> 01:03:34.452
Can anything go wrong?

01:03:34.622 --> 01:03:36.247
Well...

01:03:38.334 --> 01:03:40.826
...once the rockets have been launched,

01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:44.872
they switch over to their own
internal decision-making systems.

01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:49.177
If these systems perform perfectly,
there's no problem.

01:03:49.347 --> 01:03:51.636
But if there's a malfunction...

01:03:51.808 --> 01:03:53.183
What are the odds?

01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:57.681
Mr President, you know
we've never done this before.

01:03:59.066 --> 01:04:00.394
The odds?

01:04:03.446 --> 01:04:05.403
Your guess is as good as mine.

01:04:05.573 --> 01:04:07.862
If you fail?

01:04:08.034 --> 01:04:10.704
The meteor will hit Earth
two hours later.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:16.999
Hit It Mr Sherwood..

01:04:18.379 --> 01:04:19.707
Get rid of it.

01:06:18.095 --> 01:06:20.587
- What is it? What's happened?
- Oh, nothing.

01:06:20.765 --> 01:06:24.051
Nothing. I just wondered
if you'd taken time to eat.

01:06:25.395 --> 01:06:27.222
Yes, I, uh, had some coffe.

01:06:27.397 --> 01:06:31.265
That will only make you nervous.
You will do better with food.

01:06:31.444 --> 01:06:35.489
You're absolutely right
Let's go eat. That's a pretty scarf.

01:06:35.657 --> 01:06:37.484
Thank you.

01:06:40.704 --> 01:06:42.495
How many children do you have?

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:44.871
Two. A boy and a girl.

01:06:45.042 --> 01:06:47.877
- How do you know I'm married?
- I asked Mr Sherwood..

01:06:48.045 --> 01:06:51.711
He also told me that you
and your wife are... separated?

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.251
I'll have a talk with Mr Sherwood..

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:57.133
I hope you don't mind
that I asked him about you.

01:06:57.306 --> 01:07:00.971
No. I would have asked Dr Dubov
about you, but my Russian's limited.

01:07:01.143 --> 01:07:03.350
- Like some coffe?
- No, thank you.

01:07:03.521 --> 01:07:05.478
What else you want to know?

01:07:05.648 --> 01:07:08.021
It would be too rude to ask.

01:07:08.193 --> 01:07:09.817
Ask what you like.

01:07:10.821 --> 01:07:13.526
Why are you and your wife separated?

01:07:14.617 --> 01:07:18.282
Nothing specific.
It uh, just happened. It's, uh...

01:07:19.455 --> 01:07:22.029
No more talks,
no more interests together.

01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:26.503
It's what we here in America
call, uh, "incompatibility".

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.963
That's what we call it in Russia.

01:07:32.219 --> 01:07:34.378
Yeah. That sounds about right.

01:07:36.432 --> 01:07:38.924
- Ever thought of living elsewhere?
- No.

01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:41.893
- Not often.
- Sometimes?

01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.138
Well...

01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:47.517
You'd like it here.
We've got everything.

01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:52.274
Power cuts, strikes, unemployment,
race riots and a terrific crime rate.

01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:56.745
Yamashiro on the Hong Kong monitor
reporting another splinter.

01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.454
Yes, Clark?

01:08:02.628 --> 01:08:06.579
We've just received a transmission
from a TWA jet over the Pacific.

01:08:06.758 --> 01:08:10.756
There was an explosion at sea,
heavy enough to knock out two engines.

01:08:10.929 --> 01:08:13.421
The plane's heading for Taiwan.

01:08:13.599 --> 01:08:17.727
They've reported a tidal wave, 100 feet
high, heading towards Hong Kong.

01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:48.220
Radar contact with the wave establishes
height stabilized at 100 feet

01:08:48.554 --> 01:08:50.962
Speed is constant 600 mlles an hour.

01:08:51.057 --> 01:08:53.015
Fifteen minutes before it hits us.

01:11:15.384 --> 01:11:18.089
- Can you hear it?
- Yes! Get out of there.

01:11:18.263 --> 01:11:21.098
It's no use. Get the big one, Paul.

01:11:21.266 --> 01:11:22.641
Get it.

01:11:40.788 --> 01:11:45.284
Fifteen minutes from now
the Russian rockets will be launched.

01:11:46.586 --> 01:11:51.165
Forty minutes after, our own rockets
will be sent to join them.

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:55.505
They will strike the meteor,
sending it into a harmless orbit

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:58.550
nevermore to menace Earth.

01:11:58.724 --> 01:12:01.097
It is Sunday.

01:12:01.269 --> 01:12:03.558
Stay in your homes.

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.141
Have faith.

01:12:05.315 --> 01:12:08.020
There is nothing we can do but wait

01:12:09.486 --> 01:12:12.690
We will let you know
when the danger has passed.

01:12:27.757 --> 01:12:29.999
Launch director says go.

01:12:30.176 --> 01:12:32.133
We've been cleared to launch.

01:12:32.303 --> 01:12:35.673
- Clear...
- Roger... Standby for clear release.

01:12:38.644 --> 01:12:41.515
Clear. Release on time.

01:12:41.689 --> 01:12:43.812
You copy? Clear. Release was on?

01:12:43.983 --> 01:12:46.854
- Autopilot light on.
- Thank you.

01:12:50.156 --> 01:12:52.315
Thirty seconds and counting.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.698
Twenty-five seconds.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.662
Zero-six-one-four...

01:13:04.673 --> 01:13:06.915
Twenty seconds.

01:13:07.092 --> 01:13:08.752
Engines start.

01:13:10.095 --> 01:13:11.922
Fifteen seconds.

01:13:12.097 --> 01:13:14.007
Engines have started.

01:13:16.060 --> 01:13:17.804
Ten seconds.

01:13:18.772 --> 01:13:21.642
Seven, six, five,

01:13:21.817 --> 01:13:24.106
four... three...

01:13:24.278 --> 01:13:26.769
Ignition. Blast-off!

01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:20.872
No problems.
We are on our way.

01:14:26.889 --> 01:14:28.597
Miss Donskaya?

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:35.222
Would you please be good enough to
convey my congratulations to Dr Dubov?

01:14:40.362 --> 01:14:41.821
My apologies, Bradley.

01:14:41.989 --> 01:14:43.947
I was very wrong.

01:14:45.785 --> 01:14:48.490
- If there's anything i can do...
- Thank you.

01:14:53.085 --> 01:14:55.161
I'll be in my office if you need me.

01:15:17.821 --> 01:15:21.024
Hercules
launch minus three minutes.

01:15:21.199 --> 01:15:24.450
All stations report on readiness.

01:15:24.620 --> 01:15:27.028
Power operating at correct levels.

01:15:27.206 --> 01:15:28.998
Engine parameters all OK.

01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:31.124
Hercules targeted correctly...

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:35.339
Ground facilities have
conformation Hercules has received

01:15:35.507 --> 01:15:37.251
and stored the launch command.

01:15:37.426 --> 01:15:40.344
- Yes, Sir Michael?
- I've got some serious news.

01:15:40.513 --> 01:15:42.920
- I'd like a word with Dr Bradley.
- Yes, sir.

01:15:43.099 --> 01:15:44.130
Dr Bradley?

01:15:44.308 --> 01:15:46.301
Sir Michael would like to talk to you.

01:15:52.901 --> 01:15:55.108
We've picked up another splinter.

01:15:55.279 --> 01:15:57.272
- A big one.
- Direction?

01:15:57.448 --> 01:15:58.942
The United States.

01:15:59.117 --> 01:16:01.193
- The eastern seaboard.
- You mean us?

01:16:01.369 --> 01:16:03.695
- Near enough.
- Due when?

01:16:03.872 --> 01:16:05.948
Just about now.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.003
Can you advance Hercules?

01:16:10.171 --> 01:16:11.713
No way.

01:16:11.881 --> 01:16:13.292
Stand by.

01:16:13.466 --> 01:16:17.215
Coming up
on 90 seconds and counting. Stand by.

01:16:19.139 --> 01:16:20.930
Mark, 90 seconds.

01:16:21.767 --> 01:16:23.475
We wait

01:16:27.857 --> 01:16:30.479
We don't fire, and we go out of action.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.190
The Russian rockets aren't enough.

01:16:38.786 --> 01:16:40.245
We wait

01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:50.246
Clear. Release on time.

01:16:52.468 --> 01:16:54.544
Copy?
Clear. Release was on time.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.805
- 55 seconds.
- Thank you.

01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:05.354
Auto pilot light on.

01:17:12.198 --> 01:17:14.155
Forty seconds and counting.

01:17:23.752 --> 01:17:26.078
Thirty seconds and counting.

01:17:35.265 --> 01:17:37.223
Twenty seconds.

01:17:51.492 --> 01:17:54.065
Seven, six, five,

01:17:54.245 --> 01:17:55.739
four...

01:17:57.874 --> 01:18:00.626
Ignition.

01:22:01.353 --> 01:22:04.473
- God!
- Somebody help me.

01:22:04.648 --> 01:22:06.724
Somebody help Manheim.

01:22:48.155 --> 01:22:49.898
- You all right?
- I'm all right

01:22:50.074 --> 01:22:51.817
But I..I think...

01:23:13.892 --> 01:23:16.430
- Let's go.
- Don't worry.

01:23:16.603 --> 01:23:20.981
- Help me, please.
- Take a look

01:24:28.558 --> 01:24:32.093
This is Ops Chief Goldstone
reporting to Houston.

01:24:32.271 --> 01:24:36.732
Motor burns on all rocket engines
for both satellites appear nominal.

01:24:40.947 --> 01:24:44.316
Easton again. The situation is A-1.
All rockets functional.

01:24:44.493 --> 01:24:46.035
66 minutes to impact.

01:24:46.203 --> 01:24:48.112
We'll relay Information.

01:24:48.288 --> 01:24:51.622
There's been no contact from New York.
Have you heard?

01:24:51.792 --> 01:24:53.370
Nothing from the centre.

01:24:53.544 --> 01:24:56.462
The rest of the city's in shambles.

01:25:06.308 --> 01:25:07.969
No way.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:22.778
Dr Bradley, could you come here, please?

01:25:55.655 --> 01:25:58.656
Listen, everybody.
Listen carefully.

01:25:58.825 --> 01:26:01.447
The exit from the canteen
has been blocked.

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:05.618
We can get out through the support room.
We'll need flashlights.

01:26:07.835 --> 01:26:10.920
You head up the lead.
I'll pick up the stragglers.

01:26:11.089 --> 01:26:13.841
Everybody head for the subway tunnel.

01:26:16.553 --> 01:26:19.887
Have you got batteries
for the flashlight?

01:26:22.852 --> 01:26:24.263
Here, take this one.

01:26:24.437 --> 01:26:26.145
Just take this flashlight.

01:26:51.092 --> 01:26:53.761
Come on.
The rest of you stay where you are.

01:28:05.633 --> 01:28:07.792
Channel five of Peter the Great

01:28:07.969 --> 01:28:11.089
indicates number 4 and 7 rockets
have malfunctioned.

01:28:11.348 --> 01:28:14.682
Goldstone tracking reports
Peter the Great has lost two.

01:28:14.851 --> 01:28:18.600
- How bad is that?
- There's a safety margin of five.

01:28:18.773 --> 01:28:22.723
After the rockets join up, they'll
attack the meteor in three waves.

01:28:23.361 --> 01:28:26.944
Time to impact 35 minutes, 42 seconds.

01:29:54.087 --> 01:29:56.246
- Can we go through?
- Yes.

01:29:56.423 --> 01:29:59.543
It's OK but there's a subway car
blocking the tunnel.

01:30:00.803 --> 01:30:02.178
Get the others.

01:30:33.839 --> 01:30:35.583
It'll be all right

01:31:24.646 --> 01:31:27.054
Harry, the river's breaking through!

01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:37.158
Through that car!

01:31:37.327 --> 01:31:38.738
Hurry up!

01:31:38.912 --> 01:31:40.572
This way, through the car!

01:31:47.713 --> 01:31:49.373
Hurry up. Through the car.

01:31:50.675 --> 01:31:53.380
Help!

01:32:24.921 --> 01:32:28.088
That way!

01:32:38.853 --> 01:32:40.312
Come on, come on!

01:33:19.649 --> 01:33:21.274
Oh, my God.

01:33:27.533 --> 01:33:30.285
It's no use. Get in.

01:34:05.658 --> 01:34:07.201
You OK?

01:34:09.955 --> 01:34:11.449
Come on.

01:34:11.623 --> 01:34:13.082
Come on!

01:34:41.949 --> 01:34:44.357
Come on. Fourteen minutes till impact

01:34:45.286 --> 01:34:46.780
Fourteen minutes.

01:34:58.425 --> 01:34:59.884
Ten degrees.

01:35:00.052 --> 01:35:01.844
We're losing one from Hercules.

01:35:12.775 --> 01:35:16.642
Time to impact?
Thirteen minutes, 29 seconds.

01:35:53.904 --> 01:35:55.279
What was that?

01:35:55.447 --> 01:36:01.153
He said one day you will come to Moscow
and you will see a clean subway.

01:36:01.329 --> 01:36:03.286
One day I'll take him up on that

01:36:09.421 --> 01:36:11.248
How long?

01:36:11.882 --> 01:36:13.460
Three minutes.

01:36:24.938 --> 01:36:26.812
Two minutes, 50 seconds.

01:36:26.982 --> 01:36:30.731
Tracking stations report no more loss.
Keep your fingers crossed.

01:36:43.459 --> 01:36:47.753
Helicopters over
the city report tremendous damage.

01:36:47.922 --> 01:36:51.505
All local radio and television stations
are not functioning.

01:36:51.676 --> 01:36:56.802
Here at WADW in New Jersey, we'll keep
you informed throughout the day.

01:36:56.974 --> 01:36:58.349
Any second now.

01:39:52.878 --> 01:39:57.208
We're interrupting
our coverage to bring an announcement

01:39:57.383 --> 01:39:59.210
just received from Houston.

01:39:59.385 --> 01:40:01.627
Three minutes ago at 10.38,

01:40:01.804 --> 01:40:05.505
the combined rockets
of the United States and the USSR

01:40:05.684 --> 01:40:09.349
struck the meteor, which has
for five days been coming towards us.

01:40:09.521 --> 01:40:11.680
The danger is passed.

01:40:30.086 --> 01:40:33.171
Quiet down, everybody.
Listen, listen.

01:41:26.982 --> 01:41:31.028
With the compliments of the Dodgers.

01:41:31.195 --> 01:41:33.272
Dodgers!

01:41:33.448 --> 01:41:35.108
Baseball.
