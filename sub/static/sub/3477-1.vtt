01:50.489 --> 01:52.023
Mr. and Mrs. Dargon.

01:52.124 --> 01:53.824
- Detective.
- Detective.

01:53.925 --> 01:56.193
Are you okay?

01:58.395 --> 02:01.130
Do you remember
Mr. And Mrs. Dargon?

02:01.231 --> 02:02.731
Glen and Marcy.

02:02.832 --> 02:04.633
Are we doing first names?

02:04.734 --> 02:07.368
We talked on the phone
from the hospital, right?

02:07.469 --> 02:09.169
Yes, we called
as soon as we heard.

02:09.270 --> 02:11.003
We tried to come
and see you, but...

02:11.105 --> 02:13.640
but they wouldn't let us
until the test came back.

02:13.741 --> 02:17.676
So, here you are.

02:17.777 --> 02:18.710
Okay.

02:18.812 --> 02:20.545
Hi.

02:20.646 --> 02:22.046
Hi.

02:22.147 --> 02:24.581
Well, charges have
been pressed,

02:24.682 --> 02:27.517
and McKay will be held
without bail.

02:27.618 --> 02:29.852
So far, her hospital records
are clean,

02:29.953 --> 02:32.088
although she did refuse
to take a full examination.

02:32.189 --> 02:33.822
That's private.

02:33.923 --> 02:35.056
Of course.

02:35.157 --> 02:36.724
As discussed,

02:36.826 --> 02:38.392
she's to meet with
a court-appointed psychologist

02:38.493 --> 02:39.993
once a week, more if needed.

02:40.095 --> 02:43.062
Dr. Andrews... here's her card.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.497
This should calm down.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.832
We petitioned
for a protective order

02:45.933 --> 02:47.265
on your behalf,

02:47.366 --> 02:48.567
and that should be settled
by tomorrow.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.168
Thank you.

02:50.269 --> 02:52.002
I only wish we could
have met sooner.

02:52.104 --> 02:54.105
Thank you.

02:54.206 --> 02:57.107
Take care of yourself.

03:04.047 --> 03:06.848
Can I hug you?

03:06.949 --> 03:09.417
Um... sure.

03:15.122 --> 03:17.523
You're real...

03:17.624 --> 03:19.624
you're really here.

03:25.063 --> 03:26.930
Welcome home.

03:33.870 --> 03:36.737
Is it okay
if we stop hugging?

03:36.838 --> 03:38.772
Yes, of course.

03:41.475 --> 03:44.077
You're so big.

03:44.178 --> 03:45.445
Would you like
something to drink?

03:45.546 --> 03:46.879
I have lemonade.

03:46.980 --> 03:48.547
And tea.

03:48.648 --> 03:49.748
Water.

03:49.849 --> 03:52.483
Coming right up.

03:52.584 --> 03:54.751
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

03:54.852 --> 03:55.752
Here, let me...
I'll take...

03:55.853 --> 03:56.753
No.

03:56.854 --> 03:58.655
Okay.

04:25.043 --> 04:26.177
Is this you?

04:26.277 --> 04:27.710
Yes.

04:31.848 --> 04:33.015
And him?

04:33.116 --> 04:36.317
Yes.

04:36.418 --> 04:38.486
And this.

04:38.587 --> 04:40.320
This is me, then.

04:40.421 --> 04:42.756
Yes.

04:42.857 --> 04:44.557
There you go.

04:47.961 --> 04:49.127
You look so young.

04:51.263 --> 04:52.730
I was.

05:01.438 --> 05:03.271
I rode horses.

05:03.372 --> 05:04.973
Ponies.

05:05.074 --> 05:06.274
You had just started.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.875
You were barely four.

05:07.976 --> 05:09.443
But you kept asking,

05:09.544 --> 05:11.778
and your friend Caroline
had had some lessons,

05:11.879 --> 05:15.148
so of course you couldn't
let it go.

05:15.249 --> 05:16.882
Do you remember Caroline?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.850
No.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.952
Your birthdays
were ten days apart,

05:21.053 --> 05:23.487
so we always had
joint parties.

05:23.589 --> 05:24.822
We had costume parties,

05:24.923 --> 05:27.457
it being so close
to Halloween.

05:27.558 --> 05:29.459
You were always a princess
for your birthday

05:29.559 --> 05:32.294
and something else
for Halloween.

05:34.263 --> 05:36.364
Isn't my birthday
March 15th?

05:36.465 --> 05:40.000
No, it's October 21st.

05:40.101 --> 05:44.136
I celebrate it on March 15th.

05:44.238 --> 05:45.538
You see...

05:45.639 --> 05:46.739
Um...

05:46.840 --> 05:49.040
Yeah, here's another one.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.977
So you're about to, um,
blow out the candles,

05:52.077 --> 05:57.647
and here are the pumpkins
and leaves on the ground.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.315
Oh.

06:03.486 --> 06:05.653
We made a cheese plate,
if you're hungry.

06:05.754 --> 06:06.988
And there's a pie in the oven.

06:07.089 --> 06:08.356
Do you still like pie?

06:08.457 --> 06:10.690
Sure.

06:10.791 --> 06:12.359
Please, sit,

06:12.460 --> 06:13.927
and make yourself
comfortable,

06:14.028 --> 06:17.563
and let us know if...
if we can get you anything.

06:32.109 --> 06:35.043
Leanne.

06:35.144 --> 06:38.379
Leanne is here.

06:38.480 --> 06:42.048
Actually, my name is Leia.

06:42.149 --> 06:43.516
- Huh?
- What?

06:43.617 --> 06:45.084
My name is Leia.

06:45.185 --> 06:47.386
You changed your name?

06:47.487 --> 06:49.221
No.

06:49.322 --> 06:50.788
We... we named you Leanne.

06:50.889 --> 06:53.124
We've always
called you that.

06:53.225 --> 06:54.925
I don't remember that.

06:55.027 --> 06:56.726
I only know that
my name is Leia

06:56.827 --> 06:58.795
and that I was named
after a princess.

06:58.896 --> 07:00.129
Like from the movie?

07:00.230 --> 07:01.630
What movie?

07:01.731 --> 07:04.033
You don't know?

07:04.134 --> 07:05.633
Know what?

07:05.734 --> 07:06.868
Your name.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.303
It's Leia.

07:09.404 --> 07:11.371
Leia.

07:13.007 --> 07:14.707
Yes?

07:14.808 --> 07:16.809
No, I was just saying it.

07:16.910 --> 07:18.310
Your name.

07:25.550 --> 07:27.650
So tell us about yourself.

07:30.554 --> 07:32.721
I'm tired.

07:32.822 --> 07:35.223
Oh, would you like
to lay down?

07:35.325 --> 07:36.624
Yes.

07:36.725 --> 07:39.360
Oh, you can go right
up to your room.

07:52.271 --> 07:55.939
We didn't have time
to change anything,

07:56.040 --> 07:59.942
but we kept it
like this for you.

08:00.043 --> 08:02.978
I hope it's okay.

08:03.079 --> 08:07.182
Maybe it's nice, even.

08:07.283 --> 08:08.582
For now.

08:14.121 --> 08:15.555
Okay.

08:18.725 --> 08:21.192
All right, I'm gonna
let you get settled in.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.060
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:33.703 --> 08:35.370
Okay.

09:57.268 --> 10:01.069
I'd like to propose a toast.

10:01.171 --> 10:03.539
To Leanne.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.106
To Leia.

10:05.207 --> 10:07.108
We're so happy
to have you home.

10:07.209 --> 10:08.776
It's a miracle.

10:08.877 --> 10:11.077
Thank you.

10:26.458 --> 10:29.192
I'm sorry, are we being rude?

10:29.293 --> 10:31.861
Are you saying Grace?

10:31.962 --> 10:34.963
I'm doing a "Dear Universe. "

10:35.064 --> 10:37.131
It's a kind of prayer.

10:37.232 --> 10:38.532
"Dear Universe, thank you

10:38.633 --> 10:40.100
"for the food I'm
going to be eating,

10:40.202 --> 10:42.902
"the thoughts I'm
going to be thinking.

10:43.003 --> 10:45.938
Thank you for this moment
we are making. "

10:46.039 --> 10:48.373
And then you make wishes.

10:48.475 --> 10:50.775
Wishes?

10:50.876 --> 10:53.377
Yes.

10:53.479 --> 10:55.412
"I wish for you
to keep me honest,

10:55.513 --> 10:56.780
help me to know who I am,"

10:56.881 --> 11:00.282
and anything else you want.

11:00.383 --> 11:01.884
"Sincerely, Leia. "

11:01.985 --> 11:04.786
And you can add a P.S.
if you feel necessary.

11:04.887 --> 11:07.155
What church is that?

11:07.256 --> 11:08.822
No church.

11:08.923 --> 11:11.625
Church is for people who
can't believe in themselves.

11:11.726 --> 11:15.228
The Universe is for when
you believe in everything.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.567
Thank you.

11:25.604 --> 11:28.004
You must be hungry.

11:28.105 --> 11:29.806
Been quite a few days.

11:29.907 --> 11:33.408
The police, the hospital...

11:33.510 --> 11:35.977
Hospital food can't be that good.

11:36.078 --> 11:37.745
And all the beeping.

11:37.846 --> 11:40.013
Who can eat with
all that beeping?

11:41.616 --> 11:45.084
I remember when I was
at the hospital

11:45.185 --> 11:46.652
after I had had you.

11:46.753 --> 11:48.254
And they brought me some food,

11:48.355 --> 11:51.289
and I couldn't even recognize it.

11:51.390 --> 11:53.757
It was like astronaut food,
I swear.

11:53.858 --> 11:56.093
The only thing that I would eat
was the Jell-O...

11:56.194 --> 11:57.427
I remember that.

11:57.529 --> 11:58.427
Because the rest
of it was just so...

11:58.529 --> 11:59.829
No, I remember that,

11:59.930 --> 12:01.030
because I had a pack
of Rollo's in my pocket

12:01.131 --> 12:02.931
that you went
absolutely nuts for.

12:03.032 --> 12:04.165
- That's right, that's right.
- I mean, she went bananas.

12:04.267 --> 12:05.800
Well, I was starving.

12:05.902 --> 12:07.101
I'd never seen anybody...

12:07.202 --> 12:09.036
I was starving, because...

12:09.137 --> 12:10.437
Go through a half a pack
of Rollo's before like that.

12:10.539 --> 12:11.938
Because after you give birth,

12:12.039 --> 12:12.972
they should have a turkey dinner
waiting for you.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.531
Hello?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.033
Hi.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.167
Yeah, she's right here.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.736
It's Jill.

12:54.139 --> 12:56.540
Hello?

12:56.640 --> 12:59.542
Great.

12:59.643 --> 13:02.878
Thank you.

13:02.979 --> 13:05.480
Uh-huh.

13:05.581 --> 13:08.149
I know.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.517
I know, I was thinking
the same thing.

13:10.618 --> 13:13.720
She would be so happy.

13:13.821 --> 13:16.355
Would you like to talk to her?

13:16.456 --> 13:18.924
Hold on.

13:19.025 --> 13:23.094
Um, Leia, this is your Aunt Jill
on the phone.

13:23.195 --> 13:25.796
Why don't you say hello?

13:30.701 --> 13:32.201
So... so say hello.

13:32.302 --> 13:33.902
Hello?

13:37.339 --> 13:38.939
Okay.

13:42.977 --> 13:45.945
Congratulations for you too.

13:51.316 --> 13:52.850
Okay.

13:59.690 --> 14:01.023
I think she's done talking.

14:01.124 --> 14:03.859
Oh, okay.

14:03.960 --> 14:04.859
I should go.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.928
Hello... already?

14:07.029 --> 14:08.363
Okay.

14:08.464 --> 14:09.930
Jill?

14:10.031 --> 14:11.898
Yeah, she's tired.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.767
I'll see you tonight.

14:14.868 --> 14:17.069
- I'll see you tonight.
- Of course.

14:19.138 --> 14:23.240
Okay, so would you describe
your first week at home

14:23.341 --> 14:26.276
as a positive experience?

14:26.378 --> 14:28.878
Sure.

14:28.979 --> 14:30.813
I notice you say that a lot.

14:30.914 --> 14:32.581
"Sure. "

14:32.682 --> 14:34.216
We just met.

14:34.317 --> 14:37.451
Yes, but over
the last half hour,

14:37.552 --> 14:38.552
"Would you like to sit?"

14:38.654 --> 14:41.154
"Can I get you some tea?"

14:41.255 --> 14:43.223
"Have you been sleeping
on a regular schedule?"

14:43.324 --> 14:45.324
"Do you find yourself adapting
to your new surroundings?"

14:45.425 --> 14:48.594
All these are things
you answered "sure" to.

14:48.695 --> 14:51.729
Maybe you should ask
different questions.

14:51.830 --> 14:54.331
Maybe you're right.

14:54.432 --> 14:57.834
How would you describe
your first week at home?

14:57.935 --> 15:02.271
As a positive experience.

15:03.939 --> 15:05.974
Do I make you uncomfortable?

15:06.075 --> 15:07.775
No.

15:07.876 --> 15:11.311
Do I make you uncomfortable?

15:11.413 --> 15:13.513
Of course not.

15:13.614 --> 15:15.481
Okay.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.582
"Sure" is a noncommittal
statement,

15:17.684 --> 15:18.950
even in the affirmative.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.619
If I say,
"Do you want some tea?"

15:20.720 --> 15:22.119
and you say, "Sure,"

15:22.220 --> 15:24.021
it tells me that you want tea

15:24.122 --> 15:27.424
only because I asked it,
not because you want it.

15:27.525 --> 15:29.993
I want you to feel free
to express definites,

15:30.093 --> 15:31.860
concrete feelings.

15:31.961 --> 15:34.296
This is a safe environment.

15:34.397 --> 15:35.863
Okay.

15:35.964 --> 15:37.532
I don't really want this tea.

15:43.137 --> 15:47.106
Everything you say here
is confidential.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.541
You keep writing things
in that folder.

15:49.642 --> 15:52.676
I keep notes.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.713
But you are looking
for things, right?

15:55.814 --> 15:57.680
Against Ben.

15:57.781 --> 16:00.616
Are you concerned about Ben?

16:00.718 --> 16:02.651
Are you looking for things?

16:02.752 --> 16:05.954
My only true concern
is how you are doing,

16:06.055 --> 16:08.189
how you are feeling,

16:08.290 --> 16:11.491
that you feel supported.

16:11.592 --> 16:13.359
Okay.

16:13.461 --> 16:15.894
If there's anything I can do
to make that clearer to you,

16:15.995 --> 16:17.463
do not hesitate to tell me.

16:17.564 --> 16:19.098
I am here for you.

16:22.334 --> 16:23.901
Can you stop calling it "home?"

16:24.002 --> 16:26.737
Like, my "transition back home?"

16:26.838 --> 16:27.838
All right.

16:27.939 --> 16:29.739
Does it not feel like home?

16:29.840 --> 16:33.842
Would a place you don't remember
feel like home to you?

16:33.943 --> 16:36.311
How does it feel?

16:36.412 --> 16:38.979
Like a place I don't remember,

16:39.080 --> 16:41.048
like a neighbor's house.

16:41.149 --> 16:43.483
Did you spend much time
at neighbor's houses

16:43.584 --> 16:47.686
when you were with Mr. McKay?

16:47.787 --> 16:48.987
No.

16:49.088 --> 16:51.289
I spent time at home.

17:18.778 --> 17:20.377
Want some dessert?

17:33.823 --> 17:34.923
You don't have to look at that.

17:35.024 --> 17:37.992
It's just...
it's just there.

17:40.162 --> 17:41.494
Can I have this?

17:41.595 --> 17:44.230
No.

17:44.331 --> 17:47.299
Or not right now, okay?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.967
Congratulations, God bless.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.968
I've been following on the
news and everything

17:51.069 --> 17:52.436
from the very beginning.

17:52.538 --> 17:53.905
- So inspiring.
- Thank you.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.605
You are so inspiring.

17:55.706 --> 17:57.440
You must be so happy
to be home.

17:57.542 --> 17:58.675
You holding up okay?

17:58.776 --> 17:59.809
Fine, thanks.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.177
Oh, I bet you are.

18:01.278 --> 18:02.178
Just excuse me.

18:02.279 --> 18:03.678
You are in our prayers.

18:03.779 --> 18:05.780
I hope that monster gets
everything he deserves.

18:05.881 --> 18:06.915
Don't you worry.

18:07.016 --> 18:09.349
Thank you, thank you.

18:09.450 --> 18:11.084
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:18.791 --> 18:21.759
I'm sorry about that.

18:21.860 --> 18:23.294
People have
a lot of questions,

18:23.395 --> 18:25.696
and sometimes it gets
the better of them.

18:25.797 --> 18:29.265
Questions about what?

18:29.366 --> 18:31.300
Well...

18:31.401 --> 18:35.037
about you and
how you're doing,

18:35.138 --> 18:39.173
what you went through...

18:39.274 --> 18:42.275
how you survived.

18:42.376 --> 18:44.177
Survived what?

18:45.812 --> 18:48.047
The unknown, I guess.

18:50.950 --> 18:53.584
I could ask everyone else
the same question.

19:37.786 --> 19:38.852
You're ruining it!

19:38.953 --> 19:40.554
You're ruining everything!

19:40.655 --> 19:43.155
Hey, don't say that.

19:43.257 --> 19:44.523
Ruiner!

19:44.625 --> 19:46.525
Leia, that's not very nice.

19:46.627 --> 19:48.493
You are not very nice.

19:48.594 --> 19:49.995
Yeah?

19:50.096 --> 19:53.497
Who else do you know
that's nicer, huh?

19:53.598 --> 19:54.899
No one.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.066
That's right.

19:57.167 --> 19:58.401
You're hurting him!

19:58.502 --> 19:59.736
Let's take him
to the hospital.

19:59.837 --> 20:01.370
He has to go
to the hospital.

20:01.471 --> 20:05.407
Leia, we both know
he can't go to a hospital.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.008
And why?

20:07.109 --> 20:08.943
- But he has to...
- Leia.

20:12.613 --> 20:14.381
Hospitals are bad.

20:14.482 --> 20:15.681
Yes.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.082
And why?

20:17.183 --> 20:19.083
You can't just say
something is bad

20:19.184 --> 20:22.687
without knowing why.

20:22.788 --> 20:25.055
They have no confidence
in the nature of things

20:25.156 --> 20:27.357
and no respect
for the mystery of life.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.925
Yeah.

20:29.026 --> 20:32.894
And part of the mystery of life
is death.

20:32.995 --> 20:38.132
And part of the nature of things
is accepting that.

20:38.233 --> 20:41.035
I don't want him to die.

20:41.136 --> 20:46.105
Well, look who's lost
confidence in me, huh?

20:48.207 --> 20:50.108
Are you ready for a story?

20:50.209 --> 20:51.909
Which one should I read?

20:52.010 --> 20:54.645
<i>How about
The Frog Prince?</i>

20:54.746 --> 20:56.147
You can follow...

20:56.452 --> 20:58.415
He's fixed.

20:58.516 --> 21:00.783
You fixed him.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.218
That's what I told you
I was doing.

21:03.320 --> 21:05.219
I thought you were
hurting him,

21:05.321 --> 21:06.554
like a doctor.

21:06.655 --> 21:08.822
No, I was fixing him,

21:08.923 --> 21:10.657
like a Ben.

21:14.995 --> 21:16.662
Look at you.

21:16.763 --> 21:19.764
You're a mess.

21:19.865 --> 21:22.299
I'm not a mess.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.401
You get so worked up.

21:24.502 --> 21:26.003
Sorry.

21:26.104 --> 21:28.271
No, you don't
have to apologize.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.940
We can't help
what we feel.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.842
But we can help
what we think, right?

21:33.943 --> 21:37.511
So why would you think
I would hurt Teddy?

21:37.612 --> 21:38.946
I don't know.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.514
You don't know what you think?

21:41.615 --> 21:43.850
I thought you were mad at me.

21:43.951 --> 21:45.684
Why would I be mad at you?

21:45.785 --> 21:48.354
For looking out the window.

21:48.455 --> 21:51.923
I was concerned when you were
looking out the window, yeah.

21:52.024 --> 21:55.692
I didn't want you
to see something scary.

21:55.793 --> 21:57.661
But I fixed it, right?

21:57.762 --> 22:02.964
So, we don't have to worry
about that anymore.

22:03.065 --> 22:04.866
I know.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.268
But you yelled.

22:07.370 --> 22:11.005
Even if I was mad,

22:11.106 --> 22:13.339
I take care of you.

22:13.440 --> 22:16.608
Always.

22:16.709 --> 22:19.111
Okay.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.746
Okay.

23:00.077 --> 23:03.178
How long does it take trees
to grow?

23:03.279 --> 23:07.415
Maybe 30, 40 years.

23:07.516 --> 23:10.551
This has looked like this
for 40 years?

23:10.652 --> 23:12.085
More than that, actually,

23:12.186 --> 23:15.487
because we moved here
almost 25 years ago,

23:15.588 --> 23:17.990
and the trees were big then too.

23:23.128 --> 23:26.897
Why does Glen get to leave?

23:26.998 --> 23:29.331
Well, he goes to work.

23:40.475 --> 23:42.575
We could leave too.

24:14.468 --> 24:16.602
What do you think?

24:16.703 --> 24:17.903
You could try it on.

24:18.004 --> 24:19.671
Sure.

24:24.676 --> 24:26.110
Oh, that looks so pretty.

24:26.211 --> 24:28.111
Do you like it?

24:28.212 --> 24:29.378
Do you want to try it

24:29.480 --> 24:32.547
without the other
shirts underneath?

24:32.648 --> 24:34.649
I always wear these.

24:47.026 --> 24:48.160
Would to try it?

24:48.261 --> 24:49.962
Now...

24:50.062 --> 24:51.629
How is that one?

24:51.730 --> 24:53.931
That's... that's not as tight
as the other one, right?

24:54.032 --> 24:55.265
Good.

24:55.366 --> 24:56.399
Do you want me to adjust it?

24:56.501 --> 24:57.501
It's adjustable back here.

24:57.602 --> 24:58.602
- No.
- No?

24:58.703 --> 25:00.302
Okay, great.

25:00.403 --> 25:02.471
Great.

25:02.572 --> 25:05.507
Well, I think that
should work better

25:05.608 --> 25:06.508
under the clothes.

25:06.609 --> 25:08.675
I can do it.

25:08.776 --> 25:10.644
Okay.

25:10.745 --> 25:12.012
Okay.

25:17.250 --> 25:18.817
Don't... don't forget...

25:18.918 --> 25:21.685
don't forget to come out
and show me.

25:21.786 --> 25:24.021
If... if you want to.

25:48.608 --> 25:50.975
It was... it was really nice.

25:51.076 --> 25:54.444
I think she liked the
clothes that we found.

25:54.546 --> 25:56.680
She looked great in them,

25:56.781 --> 25:59.482
really beautiful.

25:59.583 --> 26:03.118
I hope she liked them.

26:03.219 --> 26:05.687
Good.

26:05.788 --> 26:09.190
See?
It's good.

26:09.291 --> 26:12.125
Yeah, it's good.

26:12.226 --> 26:14.194
She's...

26:16.496 --> 26:20.199
She's sweet.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.966
Dear Universe,

26:22.067 --> 26:24.669
thank you for the thoughts
I'm going to be thinking.

26:24.770 --> 26:27.737
Thank you for the dreams
I'm going to be dreaming.

26:27.838 --> 26:31.173
Thank you for this moment
we are making.

26:31.274 --> 26:32.875
I wish for you
to keep me honest

26:32.976 --> 26:36.177
and to keep an eye on Ben.

26:36.278 --> 26:38.579
Sincerely, Leia.

27:28.785 --> 27:30.253
Leia?

27:30.354 --> 27:32.054
Good morning.

28:10.318 --> 28:11.685
Leia?

28:14.054 --> 28:15.955
Leia!

28:25.630 --> 28:26.597
Leia.

28:26.698 --> 28:27.864
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

28:27.965 --> 28:28.731
I... I... I...

28:30.067 --> 28:31.400
I didn't see you out there.

28:31.501 --> 28:32.634
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

28:32.735 --> 28:34.603
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

28:40.142 --> 28:42.242
You know what we're
gonna do today?

28:42.343 --> 28:43.710
We're gonna get you
an ID card

28:43.811 --> 28:46.612
so that...

28:46.713 --> 28:48.681
so that you have
an ID card.

28:49.915 --> 28:51.482
Okay.

28:57.021 --> 28:59.188
Salem, Pennsylvania.

29:01.191 --> 29:03.491
Department
of Motor Vehicles.

29:09.197 --> 29:13.733
What does "Louise" mean?

29:13.834 --> 29:15.668
It's your middle name.

29:47.627 --> 29:49.561
It's work.

29:54.899 --> 29:57.333
Okay.

29:57.434 --> 29:59.836
Whatever it is,

29:59.937 --> 30:04.706
I think we should just
try to be more...

30:04.807 --> 30:06.841
than we were.

30:06.942 --> 30:09.110
We already are.

30:09.211 --> 30:11.778
We already are
more than we were.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.009
Leia?

30:52.110 --> 30:53.344
You okay in there?

30:53.445 --> 30:55.012
Oh, oh, okay,
okay, I'll get it.

30:55.113 --> 30:56.413
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:56.514 --> 30:57.414
It's alright.
Here.

30:57.515 --> 30:58.982
Careful.
I'll get it,

30:59.083 --> 31:01.216
I'll get it, I'll get it.
There we go.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.551
It's all fine, it's all fine.

31:02.652 --> 31:04.319
I like the bread warm.

31:04.421 --> 31:05.319
That's okay.

31:05.421 --> 31:06.421
How do we... let's see.

31:06.522 --> 31:08.089
I like it toasty, sorry.

31:08.190 --> 31:09.923
That's all right.

31:10.024 --> 31:11.892
It'll... it'll go off
in just a second.

31:11.993 --> 31:15.327
This happens all the time.

31:16.430 --> 31:19.764
There we go.
Okay.

31:19.865 --> 31:21.666
There we go.

31:21.767 --> 31:24.268
- Sorry.
- No, that's fine.

31:24.369 --> 31:29.439
So... for next time,
there's a toaster.

31:29.540 --> 31:31.274
You know.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.108
So you could toast
the bread first,

31:33.209 --> 31:36.410
and then make the sandwich.

31:36.511 --> 31:38.746
Oh, yeah.

31:38.847 --> 31:41.181
Here, let's start again.

31:41.282 --> 31:43.917
Okay, here we go.

31:44.018 --> 31:46.118
And...

31:46.219 --> 31:47.753
Here you go.

31:57.562 --> 31:58.762
Mm-hmm.

31:58.863 --> 32:00.596
Now turn it on.

32:07.236 --> 32:08.902
There we go.

32:09.003 --> 32:10.971
- Oh, right.
- Mm-hmm.

32:15.542 --> 32:19.478
Mr. McKay didn't
have a kitchen?

32:19.579 --> 32:22.546
We had a kitchen, obviously.

32:22.647 --> 32:24.048
Just, I never went
in there.

32:24.149 --> 32:26.549
It was in a different
part of the house.

32:26.650 --> 32:30.119
Ben always cooked for me.

32:30.221 --> 32:33.155
Mr. McKay.

32:33.256 --> 32:35.890
So you never left
the basement at all?

32:35.991 --> 32:38.559
You weren't allowed
in other parts of the house?

32:38.660 --> 32:40.327
We didn't call it a basement.

32:40.428 --> 32:42.529
It was where we lived.

32:44.498 --> 32:46.765
I'm sorry.

32:46.867 --> 32:48.300
That's okay.

32:48.401 --> 32:52.403
It's an honest mistake.

32:52.505 --> 32:54.404
What is?

32:54.506 --> 32:56.540
Calling it a basement.

32:59.710 --> 33:02.244
No, I meant,
about everything.

33:02.345 --> 33:03.578
I'm...

33:05.448 --> 33:08.983
I'm sorry about everything.

33:09.084 --> 33:10.918
It's okay.

33:11.019 --> 33:12.585
You're trying.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.501
Thank you for doing this
with me.

33:32.602 --> 33:36.337
It's supposed
to be therapeutic,

33:36.438 --> 33:38.273
meditative.

33:53.318 --> 33:56.387
You used to love beads.

33:56.487 --> 33:58.721
Your Aunt Jill
had a bead shop

33:58.822 --> 34:01.123
before she moved
to Santa Fe,

34:01.224 --> 34:02.891
and you loved
to go in there

34:02.992 --> 34:06.427
and sink your hands deep
into the bins of glass beads.

34:11.966 --> 34:13.199
I wanted to get you some,

34:13.301 --> 34:14.500
but I was always afraid
you'd eat them

34:14.601 --> 34:15.868
when I wasn't looking.

34:22.174 --> 34:25.542
What are you making?

34:25.643 --> 34:27.444
A string of beads.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.025
So I have room
for about six more,

34:46.125 --> 34:49.261
but I have ten beads left.

34:49.362 --> 34:51.027
Which...

34:51.129 --> 34:53.431
which ones do you think
I should leave out?

34:56.601 --> 34:59.069
Any of them.

34:59.170 --> 35:00.102
Well, help me out.

35:00.203 --> 35:02.271
Which ones do you think?

35:05.174 --> 35:06.407
I know things.

35:06.508 --> 35:07.508
Oh, I know.

35:07.610 --> 35:09.943
I wasn't nothing to him.

35:10.044 --> 35:12.746
He raised me.

35:12.847 --> 35:15.114
Okay.

35:18.718 --> 35:22.120
Also, "ones" isn't a word.

35:43.771 --> 35:44.937
What is that?

35:45.038 --> 35:46.071
What?

35:46.172 --> 35:47.706
That.

35:47.807 --> 35:49.674
Oh, that, wow.

35:49.775 --> 35:51.042
Maybe you better open it.

35:51.143 --> 35:52.777
Okay.

36:09.290 --> 36:10.891
What is it?

36:10.992 --> 36:11.958
Look through it.

36:12.059 --> 36:13.660
Look at the light.

36:16.529 --> 36:17.429
Whoa.

36:17.530 --> 36:19.264
Yeah.

36:19.365 --> 36:20.866
That's the window
I promised you.

36:20.966 --> 36:23.534
Click that button down
on the side.

36:25.303 --> 36:28.438
And those are the natural
wonders of the world,

36:28.539 --> 36:31.640
before they went away.

36:31.741 --> 36:32.975
Where did they go?

36:33.076 --> 36:35.376
You know.
I told you.

36:35.477 --> 36:38.212
Everything's ruined out there.

36:38.313 --> 36:40.547
Nothing good out there anymore.

36:40.648 --> 36:42.749
You couldn't save it?

36:42.850 --> 36:44.483
Well, you have
to pick your battles.

36:44.584 --> 36:46.719
You can only save so much.

36:46.820 --> 36:48.353
I picked you.

36:51.490 --> 36:54.291
Those trees are so big.

36:54.392 --> 36:56.393
They're called redwoods.

37:00.097 --> 37:02.597
An up-and-down river?

37:02.699 --> 37:05.167
Oh, that's Niagara Falls.

37:07.736 --> 37:11.805
Inside-out mountains?

37:11.906 --> 37:16.141
That's...
that's the Grand Canyon.

37:16.242 --> 37:18.177
It's so pretty.

37:18.278 --> 37:19.178
I love it.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.578
I love my window.

37:20.679 --> 37:23.081
Well, we have
a lot to look at.

37:23.182 --> 37:25.015
We have
underwater oceans,

37:25.116 --> 37:29.018
and night sky and space,

37:29.119 --> 37:31.921
the deserts of Africa,

37:32.022 --> 37:33.488
cities of Europe.

37:33.589 --> 37:35.323
It's like magic.

37:35.424 --> 37:36.791
Can we look at space?

37:36.892 --> 37:38.592
When you look at space,

37:38.693 --> 37:41.829
you have to lie on your back
and look up at the stars.

37:41.930 --> 37:43.596
Leia?

37:43.697 --> 37:46.199
This is Ursa Major,
the Great Bear...

37:46.300 --> 37:49.935
Leia.

37:50.036 --> 37:52.703
You seem distracted.

37:52.804 --> 37:55.005
Sorry.

37:55.107 --> 37:58.308
What are you
thinking about?

37:58.409 --> 38:02.010
Did you ever see
Niagara Falls?

38:02.112 --> 38:05.613
Um, once,
when I was very small.

38:05.714 --> 38:08.516
Was it very far away?

38:08.617 --> 38:13.353
It's an eight,
or nine-hour drive.

38:13.454 --> 38:14.487
What about
the Grand Canyon?

38:14.588 --> 38:16.689
Was that far?

38:16.790 --> 38:20.358
It's in Arizona.

38:20.459 --> 38:22.794
Yes.

38:22.894 --> 38:24.795
It is in Arizona.

38:24.896 --> 38:26.396
Yes.

38:49.482 --> 38:52.183
This is a very special
birthday for us,

38:52.284 --> 38:53.918
for all of us.

38:54.019 --> 38:58.922
And we wanted to give you
something really special.

38:59.022 --> 39:01.323
We're very proud of you, Leia.

39:01.424 --> 39:05.093
Okay.

39:05.194 --> 39:06.594
Now...

39:08.663 --> 39:10.531
Open your eyes.

39:10.632 --> 39:11.532
What...

39:11.633 --> 39:12.932
It won't hurt you.

39:13.033 --> 39:14.834
It's okay, it's okay.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.702
No, no, no, no, no,
it's okay.

39:16.804 --> 39:18.270
It's okay, it's okay.

39:18.371 --> 39:19.738
Feel her,
feel how soft she is.

39:19.839 --> 39:21.539
- I don't want it.
- She's harmless.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.274
Here, touch her, touch her.

39:23.375 --> 39:24.608
I don't want it.

39:24.709 --> 39:26.409
- Leia.
- I don't want it.

39:26.510 --> 39:27.744
- Marcy.
- Leia.

39:27.845 --> 39:28.912
We're sorry.

39:51.463 --> 39:52.897
I'll go bring back the dog.

39:52.998 --> 39:54.865
No, don't do that.

39:54.966 --> 39:57.800
Don't act like you're
righting some wrong of mine.

39:57.901 --> 39:59.402
I will take the
dog back myself.

39:59.503 --> 40:01.103
It was my idea.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.632
This doesn't make sense.

40:37.733 --> 40:39.399
It makes perfect sense.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.767
People have been
doing trust falls

40:40.869 --> 40:42.269
for generations.

40:42.370 --> 40:44.070
But I don't understand
why we're practicing

40:44.171 --> 40:46.606
something that isn't
going to happen in real life.

40:46.707 --> 40:51.309
So, this isn't a practice
for a real fall.

40:51.410 --> 40:53.911
This is the actual fall.

40:54.012 --> 40:55.679
It's a metaphor,

40:55.780 --> 41:00.516
for... things that happen
in real life.

41:00.618 --> 41:03.252
Now, turn back around.

41:03.353 --> 41:04.920
Come on, here we go.

41:06.722 --> 41:09.857
Now... fall.

41:21.267 --> 41:25.269
So it's natural
that you hesitate,

41:25.370 --> 41:29.205
because you've never
trusted anybody before.

41:29.306 --> 41:31.440
I haven't?

41:31.541 --> 41:34.376
No.

41:34.477 --> 41:37.144
I'm here.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.380
I'm gonna catch you.

41:39.481 --> 41:41.681
Now fall.

41:51.823 --> 41:54.158
Okay, um...

41:54.259 --> 41:57.327
Maybe... would it help
if I went first?

41:57.428 --> 41:58.995
If I let myself fall backwards

41:59.096 --> 42:00.796
and you caught me?

42:00.897 --> 42:03.999
Let's try that.

42:04.099 --> 42:05.366
Okay.

42:07.770 --> 42:09.903
I'm gonna fall backwards,

42:10.004 --> 42:11.905
and you're gonna catch me.

42:12.006 --> 42:17.143
One, two, three.

42:24.249 --> 42:26.716
How is she?

42:26.817 --> 42:28.217
She's fine.

42:28.319 --> 42:29.953
I drew her a bath.

42:30.054 --> 42:32.020
It'll get better.

42:32.121 --> 42:34.957
It is getting better.

42:35.058 --> 42:37.558
You're always looking
ahead of everything.

42:37.659 --> 42:39.327
"She'll be fine. "

42:39.428 --> 42:41.061
"We'll get through it. "

42:41.162 --> 42:42.228
"Let's wait till morning. "

42:42.330 --> 42:43.496
"Let's see what the police say. "

42:43.597 --> 42:45.864
"Let's have another baby. "

42:45.966 --> 42:47.833
What about now?

42:47.934 --> 42:49.701
What about what's happening
right now?

42:49.802 --> 42:51.703
I need you with me in this.

42:51.804 --> 42:52.870
I am.

42:52.972 --> 42:54.404
Well, it doesn't feel like it.

42:54.505 --> 42:56.506
If you can't see
that I'm in this with you,

42:56.607 --> 42:57.841
that I...

42:59.643 --> 43:01.911
I want us to move on, yes.

43:02.012 --> 43:03.678
But I've also spent
the last 20 years

43:03.779 --> 43:05.080
holding your hand

43:05.181 --> 43:06.982
through the search initiatives

43:07.083 --> 43:08.649
and the anniversary vigils

43:08.750 --> 43:10.084
and you never going
back to work.

43:10.185 --> 43:11.185
That's not fair.

43:11.286 --> 43:12.852
Nothing's fair.

43:12.953 --> 43:14.887
You have to move on,

43:14.989 --> 43:17.255
especially now,
now that it's over.

43:17.357 --> 43:19.257
- It's not over.
- Because of you.

43:19.359 --> 43:20.925
You stopped.
Everything stopped.

43:21.026 --> 43:22.727
Why is it that
when you talk about it,

43:22.828 --> 43:26.196
it's always like something
that only happened to me,

43:26.297 --> 43:30.432
like you're some noble outsider,
some... some saint,

43:30.533 --> 43:32.501
who sacrificed his life for me.

43:32.602 --> 43:34.069
I have sacrificed my life.

43:34.170 --> 43:36.337
No.
It was taken.

43:36.438 --> 43:37.872
Our life was taken,

43:37.973 --> 43:40.407
and you are not giving
me anything, or her.

43:40.508 --> 43:44.176
Why won't you read
one of these books?

43:44.277 --> 43:46.045
Why won't you show
an even minor interest

43:46.146 --> 43:47.380
in how hard this is?

43:47.481 --> 43:48.947
It doesn't have to be
that hard.

43:49.048 --> 43:51.416
How would you even begin
to know how hard it is

43:51.517 --> 43:53.717
if you won't let yourself
be a part of it?

43:53.818 --> 43:57.553
In case you haven't noticed,
we need your help,

43:57.654 --> 43:59.689
whether you think we do
or not.

44:10.531 --> 44:12.465
I didn't know
anyone was in here.

44:12.566 --> 44:16.201
No one said
if I could get out.

44:16.302 --> 44:18.170
Let me get you a towel.

44:37.153 --> 44:39.953
We want to talk to you
about your future.

44:40.055 --> 44:41.522
My future?

44:41.623 --> 44:43.456
We know that you're smart

44:43.557 --> 44:45.391
and that you know things.

44:45.492 --> 44:47.692
And we think that
maybe the best way

44:47.794 --> 44:49.661
to assess what you already know

44:49.762 --> 44:52.663
and structure
your future learning

44:52.764 --> 44:54.498
might be a tutor.

44:54.599 --> 44:56.199
What's a tutor?

44:56.300 --> 44:59.235
A teacher.

44:59.336 --> 45:02.171
A teacher who comes
to the house

45:02.272 --> 45:03.705
and works with you

45:03.807 --> 45:06.074
to make sure you have
everything you need.

45:06.175 --> 45:09.010
Leia.

45:09.111 --> 45:11.011
- Leia.
- Go away.

45:11.112 --> 45:12.012
Leia.

45:12.113 --> 45:13.313
- Go away!
- Hey.

45:13.414 --> 45:14.814
Hey, that's not fair.

45:14.915 --> 45:15.815
Where have you been?

45:15.916 --> 45:16.849
I'm sorry.

45:16.950 --> 45:18.217
That's what's not fair.

45:18.317 --> 45:19.517
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry!

45:19.618 --> 45:20.852
Three days!

45:20.953 --> 45:22.053
You left me for three days!

45:22.154 --> 45:23.420
Two and a half days.

45:23.521 --> 45:24.555
Why would you do that?

45:24.656 --> 45:25.556
Why?

45:25.657 --> 45:26.890
I'm sorry.

45:26.991 --> 45:28.191
- I called your name.
- I know.

45:28.292 --> 45:29.559
You get everything!

45:29.660 --> 45:30.726
- All right, all right.
- I hate you!

45:30.828 --> 45:32.761
Get it all out.

45:32.862 --> 45:34.096
All right, all right,
hey, hey, hey.

45:34.197 --> 45:35.397
Care!

45:35.498 --> 45:36.664
Why don't you care
that I hate you?

45:36.765 --> 45:37.932
Because you don't hate me.

45:38.033 --> 45:39.233
Yes, I do!

45:39.334 --> 45:40.834
You want me to die
like an animal!

45:40.935 --> 45:42.202
Aah!

45:42.303 --> 45:43.203
Stop it!

45:43.304 --> 45:45.704
Stop it now!

45:45.805 --> 45:47.940
Now, look at me!
Look!

45:48.041 --> 45:49.441
Leia.

45:49.542 --> 45:53.344
Now we are even, yes?

45:53.445 --> 45:54.778
But I didn't mean
to hurt you.

45:54.879 --> 45:56.880
I didn't mean
to stay away so long.

45:56.981 --> 45:59.582
You did mean to hit me.

45:59.683 --> 46:00.749
You aimed.

46:00.851 --> 46:04.119
You got me, on purpose.

46:04.220 --> 46:05.553
Okay.

46:07.490 --> 46:08.789
Okay?

46:14.795 --> 46:16.129
And I didn't mean
to hurt you.

46:16.230 --> 46:17.696
I don't believe you.

46:20.466 --> 46:23.934
If you don't believe me,

46:24.035 --> 46:25.736
then... then what?

46:25.837 --> 46:27.804
Then what have you got?

46:29.974 --> 46:32.341
Nothing.

46:32.442 --> 46:33.575
That's the point.

46:33.676 --> 46:34.843
I don't have anything.

46:34.944 --> 46:37.178
Don't... don't say that.

46:37.279 --> 46:41.214
Look, everything I do
is for you.

46:41.315 --> 46:42.415
If you don't have anything,

46:42.517 --> 46:44.216
then what am I?

46:44.317 --> 46:47.086
I'm...
I'm a failure?

46:52.358 --> 46:55.492
Come on.

46:55.593 --> 46:57.394
Shh.

46:57.495 --> 47:00.263
Come on, shh.

47:06.968 --> 47:09.236
What's gonna happen
to me, Ben?

47:14.608 --> 47:17.109
What's gonna happen
to me after this?

47:20.612 --> 47:21.846
There...

47:21.947 --> 47:24.081
There is no "after this. "

47:27.518 --> 47:30.619
Anyway, think about it.

47:30.720 --> 47:35.290
We've got three weeks
till the first session.

47:35.391 --> 47:38.193
Leia?

47:38.293 --> 47:39.693
Okay.

48:02.378 --> 48:04.346
Brennan, Pennsylvania.

48:09.218 --> 48:11.051
Packerton County Jail.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.259
Leia.

50:33.029 --> 50:34.796
You came.

50:36.799 --> 50:38.733
I miss you.

50:42.770 --> 50:46.339
You look different.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.873
You look good.

50:48.974 --> 50:50.408
I like your hair.

50:50.509 --> 50:52.476
Looks nice like that.

51:18.965 --> 51:20.798
Did you know...

51:26.337 --> 51:30.639
Did you know that you were
changing things about me?

51:30.741 --> 51:35.744
Like my name...
and birthday?

51:35.845 --> 51:38.612
I didn't know those things
about you to begin with,

51:38.713 --> 51:42.148
so I didn't think
I was changing anything.

51:42.249 --> 51:45.885
I was giving you things.

51:45.986 --> 51:50.589
You can't change
what you don't know.

51:50.690 --> 51:53.591
I don't know
how to do anything.

51:53.692 --> 51:55.725
You got here, didn't you?

51:55.826 --> 51:57.827
You could follow directions.

51:57.928 --> 51:59.162
You caught the bus.

51:59.263 --> 52:01.530
I don't know
how to do anything.

52:15.842 --> 52:17.209
You'll be fine.

52:21.380 --> 52:23.680
Do you regret it?

52:23.782 --> 52:25.182
Never regret the things you do.

52:25.283 --> 52:28.651
Regret the things you don't.

52:28.752 --> 52:31.521
It takes as much effort

52:31.622 --> 52:35.590
running in place
as running a mile.

52:35.691 --> 52:38.092
I'd rather see the mile.

52:42.296 --> 52:46.899
Even if you die in here?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.901
Even if I die in here.

52:54.072 --> 52:55.939
I can't decide
what the worst thing

52:56.040 --> 52:58.341
that's ever happened to me is...

53:03.246 --> 53:07.948
Being with you my whole life

53:08.049 --> 53:10.651
or being without you
for the rest of it.

53:24.262 --> 53:25.696
Hey.

53:30.367 --> 53:32.768
No girls in their 20s at all?

53:32.869 --> 53:34.303
What about teenagers?

53:34.404 --> 53:36.604
Any teenagers?

53:36.705 --> 53:38.406
Yes, I will hold.

53:42.543 --> 53:45.177
No, I know.

53:45.278 --> 53:48.180
Yes, you will...
you will call me

53:48.281 --> 53:50.281
if you hear anything.

54:17.937 --> 54:19.137
Okay.

56:58.895 --> 56:59.862
Oh, my God, where were you?

56:59.963 --> 57:00.863
Are you okay?

57:00.964 --> 57:02.598
Where were you?

57:02.698 --> 57:04.699
Leia, where were you?

57:04.800 --> 57:07.102
I went for a walk.

57:07.202 --> 57:09.436
A walk?

57:09.537 --> 57:10.471
For seven hours?

57:10.572 --> 57:11.705
Yes.

57:11.805 --> 57:13.606
Where did you walk?

57:13.707 --> 57:15.341
I don't know, a park.

57:15.442 --> 57:17.242
What park?

57:19.779 --> 57:21.312
Grayson Park?

57:21.413 --> 57:22.780
Yes.

57:22.881 --> 57:23.981
With the fountain?

57:24.082 --> 57:25.315
Yes.

57:25.416 --> 57:26.816
There is no fountain
in Grayson Park.

57:26.917 --> 57:28.451
Then the park
with the fountain.

57:28.552 --> 57:31.487
There is no park
with a fountain.

57:31.588 --> 57:33.389
You can trust me.

57:33.490 --> 57:35.456
And you can tell me
where you were.

57:35.557 --> 57:37.892
I did.

57:37.993 --> 57:40.360
I don't think you did.

57:44.464 --> 57:46.432
What is this?

57:51.771 --> 57:54.171
Stop it!

57:54.272 --> 57:56.206
Hey, Leia.

57:56.307 --> 57:57.340
We were worried
about you.

57:57.441 --> 57:58.341
Are you okay?

57:58.442 --> 57:59.575
Nothing is okay.

57:59.677 --> 58:00.977
Look at this.

58:01.078 --> 58:02.544
- They're pictures of him.
- No.

58:02.645 --> 58:04.146
These are pictures
of him, Glen.

58:04.247 --> 58:05.681
Stop, they're mine.

58:05.782 --> 58:08.182
I found them under her bed.

58:08.283 --> 58:11.151
"Today is my fake
real birthday.

58:11.252 --> 58:13.086
I wanted to tell you
I'm sorry... "

58:13.187 --> 58:15.721
- Come on.
- "For blowing out the candles.

58:15.822 --> 58:17.690
"Even though
without me telling you,

58:17.791 --> 58:19.425
"you wouldn't even know,

58:19.525 --> 58:22.026
"but I feel so bad about it,
I have to tell you,

58:22.127 --> 58:23.428
"so I can apologize.

58:23.529 --> 58:24.761
"I'm sorry,

58:24.862 --> 58:26.430
and I'm sorry
for telling you. "

58:26.531 --> 58:28.432
What kind of a hold does
this man have over you?

58:28.532 --> 58:30.666
Okay, okay, Marcy.
That's enough.

58:30.767 --> 58:31.934
You've had enough, Glen?

58:32.035 --> 58:33.668
Can we talk about this?

58:33.769 --> 58:35.036
We will sit down...

58:35.137 --> 58:36.905
I don't think we
can talk about this.

58:37.006 --> 58:38.105
I... I don't think so.

58:38.206 --> 58:39.206
Put the phone down.

58:39.307 --> 58:40.574
Hello, this is Marcy Dargon.

58:40.675 --> 58:42.009
I'm calling for Detective Timms.

58:42.109 --> 58:43.009
- It's an emergency.
- Marcy, wait.

58:43.110 --> 58:44.010
What are you doing?

58:44.111 --> 58:45.611
Wait.

58:45.713 --> 58:46.878
Well, please tell him this is Marcy...

58:46.979 --> 58:48.180
- Stop!
- It's an emergency.

58:48.281 --> 58:49.281
It's an emergency!

58:49.382 --> 58:51.382
Stop getting him
into trouble!

58:51.483 --> 58:52.750
- Give me those!
- These are not yours.

58:52.851 --> 58:53.918
- They're mine!
- These are not yours!

58:54.019 --> 58:55.219
- Give them back!
- No!

58:55.320 --> 58:56.286
He is hurting you!

58:56.387 --> 58:57.620
He is still hurting you!

58:57.722 --> 58:58.755
- No!
- He's hurting you right...

58:58.856 --> 58:59.956
You are hurting me!

59:00.057 --> 59:02.491
You!
You did this to me!

59:05.561 --> 59:08.096
Go upstairs.

59:08.197 --> 59:09.496
Go!

59:16.803 --> 59:18.903
Thank you for all your help.

59:19.004 --> 59:20.705
What's wrong with you?

59:20.806 --> 59:21.973
I am done.

59:22.074 --> 59:23.073
You can't just
give up on her.

59:23.174 --> 59:24.108
With you.

59:24.209 --> 59:25.309
I am done with you.

59:25.410 --> 59:26.744
Oh, you're done with me?

59:26.845 --> 59:28.411
I am so sick of dragging
you around on my...

59:28.512 --> 59:29.545
Is that what you think?

59:29.646 --> 59:31.380
Yes.

59:31.482 --> 59:33.415
Do you have any idea what this
has been like for me, huh?

59:33.516 --> 59:34.883
What you have
been like for me?

59:34.984 --> 59:36.817
What you have been
all these years?

59:36.918 --> 59:38.452
Where you have been?

59:38.553 --> 59:40.254
Where have you been
all these years and years?

59:40.355 --> 59:42.489
Here.

59:42.590 --> 59:44.758
In our actual life,

59:44.859 --> 59:47.559
in what actually
happened to us,

59:47.660 --> 59:52.163
in what actually
is still happening to us.

59:52.264 --> 59:55.565
And it is not my fault
that you cannot do that,

59:55.666 --> 59:57.601
and it is not my responsibility
to make you.

59:57.702 --> 59:59.502
I want to move on,
for Christ's sake.

59:59.603 --> 01:00:01.137
I want us all to move on.

01:00:01.238 --> 01:00:02.638
No.

01:00:02.739 --> 01:00:04.906
You want us to be different.

01:00:05.007 --> 01:00:07.305
You want to fast-forward
to the easy part.

01:00:07.618 --> 01:00:10.110
Well, there isn't one,
not like this.

01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:14.147
And I cannot drag Leanne
back into reality

01:00:14.248 --> 01:00:16.349
if I have to do
the same for you.

01:00:19.385 --> 01:00:21.519
And I choose her.

01:01:02.952 --> 01:01:05.287
The only loophole
in our system is free will,

01:01:05.388 --> 01:01:07.321
and we can't account for that.

01:01:07.422 --> 01:01:09.456
A restraining order
has since been put in place

01:01:09.558 --> 01:01:10.825
forbidding Mr. McKay

01:01:10.926 --> 01:01:12.826
to make further contact
with the girl.

01:01:12.927 --> 01:01:15.528
His lawyer released
this statement.

01:01:15.628 --> 01:01:18.997
"I deeply regret any conflict
I may have caused.

01:01:19.098 --> 01:01:21.399
"I only want what
is best for Leanne

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.134
"and apologize for any actions

01:01:23.235 --> 01:01:25.869
"that could have been
interpreted to the contrary.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.738
I wish her only good things
at this difficult time. "

01:01:37.813 --> 01:01:39.413
Hello?

01:01:50.022 --> 01:01:51.590
Hello?

01:01:57.261 --> 01:01:58.661
Who is it?

01:01:58.762 --> 01:02:01.330
It's Mr. Henry.

01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:04.066
Mr. Henry?

01:02:04.167 --> 01:02:06.200
The tutor,
for your daughter.

01:02:06.301 --> 01:02:08.002
I left you a message
last week.

01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:12.505
I confirmed with
your husband yesterday.

01:02:12.607 --> 01:02:14.573
Can I see some ID?

01:02:14.674 --> 01:02:17.176
- ID?
- Yeah.

01:02:17.277 --> 01:02:18.744
Sure.

01:02:28.018 --> 01:02:30.386
Illinois?

01:02:30.487 --> 01:02:32.454
Yeah, that's where I'm from.

01:02:39.995 --> 01:02:43.630
No, thank you.

01:02:43.731 --> 01:02:46.899
Excuse me?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.034
Excuse me?

01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:54.138
Years ago when
she became separated

01:02:54.239 --> 01:02:56.039
from a group
of neighborhood kids

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:58.875
while playing in an
inflatable castle.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:00.643
911, what is your emergency?

01:03:00.744 --> 01:03:02.211
Yes, my daughter is gone.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.812
She's missing, she's 41/2.

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:06.080
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:03:06.181 --> 01:03:08.149
She was... she was
in the bouncy castle

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:10.317
with the other kids.

01:03:10.418 --> 01:03:11.952
Ma'am, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to calm down.

01:03:12.053 --> 01:03:13.219
What is your location?

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.287
We're at Welling Park.

01:03:14.388 --> 01:03:15.288
There's a barbecue.

01:03:15.389 --> 01:03:16.822
I took off her shoes

01:03:16.924 --> 01:03:18.256
and I put her in the castle
for a minute.

01:03:18.357 --> 01:03:19.257
I was here the whole time.

01:03:19.358 --> 01:03:20.759
I've been here.

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.293
She can't go anywhere
without her shoes.

01:03:22.394 --> 01:03:24.094
She doesn't know how
to run without shoes.

01:03:24.195 --> 01:03:25.996
And how long
has she been missing?

01:03:26.097 --> 01:03:28.131
Oh, my God, I don't know!
How could I not know?

01:03:28.232 --> 01:03:30.099
Ma'am, how long ago did
you discover she was gone?

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:31.833
15 minutes, we've been looking
for her for 15 minutes.

01:03:31.935 --> 01:03:33.235
Can you tell me
what she's wearing?

01:03:33.336 --> 01:03:35.569
She's wearing a yellow t-shirt

01:03:35.671 --> 01:03:37.838
and a denim jumper,
yellow socks.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.340
She's not wearing any shoes.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:41.341
I'm holding her shoes.

01:03:41.442 --> 01:03:43.410
Benjamin McKay was a product
of the foster care system...

01:03:45.512 --> 01:03:47.813
Bouncing between over 30
residences and group homes

01:03:47.914 --> 01:03:49.147
before the age of...

01:03:52.685 --> 01:03:55.352
Hello?

01:03:55.453 --> 01:03:58.587
Oh, hi, Dr. Andrews.

01:03:58.689 --> 01:04:00.656
How are you?

01:04:00.757 --> 01:04:03.425
I was gonna call you,
and you beat me to it.

01:04:07.896 --> 01:04:10.631
Yeah, so... one of the things

01:04:10.732 --> 01:04:12.365
that I was gonna call you about

01:04:12.466 --> 01:04:15.134
is that Leanne has come down

01:04:15.235 --> 01:04:19.304
with a little touch of the flu,
we think.

01:04:19.405 --> 01:04:25.042
So can I call you when
she's feeling a little better?

01:04:25.143 --> 01:04:28.211
Thank you.

01:04:28.312 --> 01:04:31.280
Okay.

01:04:31.381 --> 01:04:32.982
Bye.

01:04:36.652 --> 01:04:37.919
Leanne?

01:04:40.822 --> 01:04:43.389
Leanne, it's time for lunch.

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:45.124
I made you a sandwich,

01:04:45.225 --> 01:04:50.061
toasted like you like it.

01:04:50.162 --> 01:04:52.263
I'm gonna slide it
under the door now.

01:05:03.172 --> 01:05:05.640
Am I still in trouble?

01:05:10.078 --> 01:05:11.878
You're not in trouble.

01:05:13.314 --> 01:05:15.647
Then can I come downstairs?

01:05:20.919 --> 01:05:22.620
Do you miss me?

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:27.057
I'm thirsty.

01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:32.928
Water's in a half an hour.

01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:35.130
Check the schedule.

01:06:26.204 --> 01:06:29.439
What do I have to do?

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:32.574
Just look at me.

01:06:32.675 --> 01:06:36.144
I don't get it.

01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:39.280
The bond that we created

01:06:39.381 --> 01:06:42.782
when you were an infant
has been erased.

01:06:42.883 --> 01:06:45.684
Children bond to their mothers

01:06:45.785 --> 01:06:47.486
in the earliest months of life,

01:06:47.587 --> 01:06:49.088
when they can't speak,

01:06:49.189 --> 01:06:51.355
when they can only look
in each other's eyes

01:06:51.457 --> 01:06:54.324
and trust that the mother
will care for them

01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:58.128
and provide the things
that they want or need,

01:06:58.229 --> 01:07:00.663
without their even asking.

01:07:02.632 --> 01:07:05.600
I'm 22.

01:07:05.701 --> 01:07:07.868
23.

01:07:07.969 --> 01:07:10.137
I'm not an infant.

01:07:10.238 --> 01:07:13.506
And that's why it's called
"attachment therapy"

01:07:13.607 --> 01:07:15.141
instead of just "attachment. "

01:07:15.242 --> 01:07:17.776
Just attachment happens
when you're a baby,

01:07:17.877 --> 01:07:21.378
but attachment therapy
happens when you're older

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:26.382
but you're incapable
of attaching to someone.

01:07:26.484 --> 01:07:29.919
I was attached to someone.

01:07:35.424 --> 01:07:38.392
This isn't something
I'm asking you to do.

01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:46.198
So...

01:07:46.299 --> 01:07:52.070
you should lie down here
with your head in my lap.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.209
Okay.

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:08.082
Now you look at me.

01:08:08.183 --> 01:08:11.651
For how long?

01:08:11.752 --> 01:08:13.553
We'll see.

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:26.729
What color are my eyes?

01:08:26.831 --> 01:08:28.732
Blue.

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:31.433
- Yours too.
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:31.535 --> 01:08:33.600
They were green
when I was born.

01:08:33.702 --> 01:08:35.103
They changed.

01:08:35.203 --> 01:08:38.604
When I was born,
did my eyes change?

01:08:38.706 --> 01:08:40.506
I don't know.

01:08:40.608 --> 01:08:43.843
Well, are there pictures?

01:08:43.944 --> 01:08:46.112
Now, you know there aren't.

01:08:56.554 --> 01:08:57.754
I want you to tell me
the story

01:08:57.854 --> 01:09:00.390
about when you found me.

01:09:00.491 --> 01:09:02.758
You mean
when you found me?

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:05.292
Please.

01:09:05.394 --> 01:09:08.362
Well, it was spring.

01:09:08.462 --> 01:09:12.365
And it was the middle
of the beginning of the end.

01:09:12.466 --> 01:09:13.633
Of the world.

01:09:13.734 --> 01:09:16.202
Of the world.

01:09:16.303 --> 01:09:18.736
And... I was driving,

01:09:18.837 --> 01:09:21.538
and something told me to stop,

01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:23.540
something in here.

01:09:23.640 --> 01:09:25.475
So I did.

01:09:25.577 --> 01:09:28.277
And there you were.

01:09:28.377 --> 01:09:29.745
What did I look like?

01:09:29.845 --> 01:09:32.148
Whew, all lit up,

01:09:32.249 --> 01:09:33.747
the brightest...

01:09:33.849 --> 01:09:37.585
You were the brightest thing
I ever saw.

01:09:37.685 --> 01:09:40.254
But you were stranded,

01:09:40.354 --> 01:09:41.821
and strangers.

01:09:41.921 --> 01:09:45.725
Am I still the brightest
thing you ever saw?

01:09:45.825 --> 01:09:50.394
You're brighter than the sun
at the center of the earth.

01:09:50.495 --> 01:09:52.296
Is there really a sun
at the center of the earth?

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:55.165
Well, there's a you,
isn't there?

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.668
Okay, keep going.

01:09:58.769 --> 01:10:01.971
Well, you could feel
I was looking at you.

01:10:02.072 --> 01:10:04.505
- In here?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:04.607 --> 01:10:07.609
So I picked you up,

01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:10.310
and you said...

01:10:10.411 --> 01:10:11.511
"Save me. "

01:10:11.613 --> 01:10:13.179
So I did.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.250
I saved you from everybody
you left behind,

01:10:18.351 --> 01:10:23.320
from ever being anything
but mine.

01:10:23.421 --> 01:10:25.489
I wish I could
remember things.

01:10:37.065 --> 01:10:39.267
What color were my eyes
when I was born?

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.601
Shh.

01:10:41.702 --> 01:10:44.337
You're not supposed to talk.

01:10:52.444 --> 01:10:54.111
They were gray.

01:11:07.056 --> 01:11:10.124
When am I allowed
to be alone again?

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:12.959
It's on the schedule.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.128
Now fall.

01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:16.995
Where's Glen?

01:11:17.096 --> 01:11:19.698
Did you make a schedule
for him too?

01:11:19.799 --> 01:11:24.168
No, we made a choice.

01:11:24.269 --> 01:11:27.637
And at some point,
we'll make a decision.

01:11:27.738 --> 01:11:31.707
Why choose to be apart
after so long?

01:11:31.808 --> 01:11:34.542
It's important to make choices,

01:11:34.643 --> 01:11:36.411
even hard ones.

01:11:39.681 --> 01:11:43.716
Now fall.

01:11:43.817 --> 01:11:44.717
I don't want to.

01:11:44.818 --> 01:11:48.353
Leanne, fall.

01:11:48.454 --> 01:11:49.721
I choose not to.

01:11:49.822 --> 01:11:51.723
You have to.

01:11:51.824 --> 01:11:52.823
On the count of three...

01:11:52.924 --> 01:11:54.558
- No.
- One, two...

01:11:54.659 --> 01:11:56.327
Aah!

01:11:59.763 --> 01:12:01.997
Now you don't get cake.

01:12:12.273 --> 01:12:14.441
I know you're scared.

01:12:14.542 --> 01:12:16.408
But it doesn't matter.

01:12:16.509 --> 01:12:18.110
I didn't catch you.

01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:20.311
That doesn't matter either.

01:12:24.449 --> 01:12:28.384
If you do this now,

01:12:28.485 --> 01:12:30.319
you can eat alone tonight.

01:12:52.404 --> 01:12:53.571
Glen?

01:12:53.672 --> 01:12:56.740
Marcy, open the door.

01:12:56.841 --> 01:12:58.541
I didn't think you were home.

01:12:58.642 --> 01:12:59.609
It's dark in there.

01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:00.809
You should turn a light on.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:03.078
I thought maybe you were out.

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:06.414
No, here.

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:09.182
I just came by for some things,
some clothes.

01:13:11.819 --> 01:13:14.954
Open up the door, Marcy.

01:13:15.055 --> 01:13:17.323
Can I at least see her,
say hi?

01:13:17.424 --> 01:13:21.326
You can't have it both ways.

01:13:21.427 --> 01:13:24.395
She'll call you
when she's ready.

01:13:24.496 --> 01:13:26.463
I'm sorry.

01:13:26.564 --> 01:13:30.566
I'm just... sorry.

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.634
I'll go get your things.

01:13:47.547 --> 01:13:50.581
At some point I'm coming
back in the house.

01:13:50.682 --> 01:13:52.850
That's my life in there too,

01:13:52.951 --> 01:13:56.253
my house.

01:13:56.354 --> 01:14:00.089
I'd rather not do this
with a lawyer, Marcy.

01:14:00.190 --> 01:14:02.191
And I wish you'd cared
half as much about us

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:04.325
as you care about
your things, but...

01:14:04.427 --> 01:14:06.194
That's not fair.

01:14:09.431 --> 01:14:10.931
Nothing's fair.

01:14:22.374 --> 01:14:24.475
Sooner or later, Marce.

01:14:24.576 --> 01:14:27.177
Fine.
Later.

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:34.049
If you need anything,
I'm not far.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.050
Over on Highland?

01:14:41.989 --> 01:14:44.857
- Yes.
- Hmm.

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:47.626
Lucky her.

01:14:47.727 --> 01:14:49.794
After all this time.

01:15:11.111 --> 01:15:12.645
Thank you.

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:37.765
No, no.

01:15:40.368 --> 01:15:41.768
Good.

01:15:50.343 --> 01:15:52.176
I'm done.

01:15:53.678 --> 01:15:55.079
Mrs. Dargon?

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:57.347
Dr. Andrews.

01:15:57.448 --> 01:15:59.215
I'm...
I'm sorry.

01:15:59.316 --> 01:16:01.183
Oh, not at all.

01:16:01.284 --> 01:16:02.417
Is everything okay?

01:16:02.519 --> 01:16:04.786
Did you need something?

01:16:04.888 --> 01:16:06.554
May I come in?

01:16:06.655 --> 01:16:09.056
Of course, please.

01:16:09.157 --> 01:16:10.891
So how is Leia?

01:16:10.992 --> 01:16:12.959
She's... she's good.

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:14.426
Oh, good.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:17.129
She hasn't been to my office
in a while now.

01:16:17.230 --> 01:16:19.964
Well, she has that cold still.

01:16:20.065 --> 01:16:22.934
It's bronchitis, I guess, now.

01:16:23.035 --> 01:16:23.934
She'll be fine.

01:16:24.035 --> 01:16:25.369
A lot of bed rest.

01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:26.570
Her flu?

01:16:26.671 --> 01:16:27.704
What?

01:16:27.804 --> 01:16:29.205
Her flu turned into bronchitis?

01:16:29.306 --> 01:16:30.640
Yes, it did.

01:16:37.178 --> 01:16:38.445
Sorry.

01:16:38.547 --> 01:16:40.114
You okay?

01:16:40.215 --> 01:16:42.015
Yeah, yeah.
I'm good, I'm good.

01:16:55.893 --> 01:16:57.127
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

01:16:57.228 --> 01:16:59.428
What happened to your face?

01:16:59.529 --> 01:17:01.063
I fell.

01:17:01.164 --> 01:17:02.498
It's minor.

01:17:02.599 --> 01:17:07.101
It's not a big deal at all, really.

01:17:07.202 --> 01:17:09.303
Glen called my office.

01:17:09.404 --> 01:17:11.838
He's worried about
you and Leia.

01:17:14.341 --> 01:17:17.143
Could we not call her that?

01:17:17.244 --> 01:17:19.778
I named her Leanne.

01:17:19.879 --> 01:17:23.314
That is her name.

01:17:23.415 --> 01:17:24.715
Sure.

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:33.095
Glen expressed concern
for both you and Leanne.

01:17:33.756 --> 01:17:37.158
He and I are taking
some time apart,

01:17:37.259 --> 01:17:41.027
as I'm sure he told you.

01:17:41.128 --> 01:17:45.097
That must be very difficult
at a time like this.

01:17:45.198 --> 01:17:47.433
Is this your first separation?

01:17:47.534 --> 01:17:51.035
I went to my sister's once,
years ago.

01:17:51.136 --> 01:17:55.505
12, 14 years ago.

01:17:55.607 --> 01:18:00.676
It was after they found
that body in Maryland.

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:04.713
How is Leanne finding
the separation?

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:07.948
Fine.

01:18:08.049 --> 01:18:10.618
Are they seeing much
of each other?

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.518
Not at the moment.

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:14.654
He's...

01:18:14.755 --> 01:18:17.823
He's not...

01:18:17.924 --> 01:18:21.459
I don't really want
to talk about Glen.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:24.228
Okay.

01:18:24.329 --> 01:18:26.997
What about other family?

01:18:27.098 --> 01:18:29.632
Your sister,
are you still close?

01:18:29.733 --> 01:18:30.699
She got married.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.167
She had two kids,

01:18:32.268 --> 01:18:37.839
11 and... 8,

01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:42.209
which made it hard to... travel.

01:18:44.177 --> 01:18:45.878
I imagine that's not easy,

01:18:45.979 --> 01:18:49.748
other people's children.

01:18:49.849 --> 01:18:52.183
You have kids, Dr. Andrews?

01:18:52.283 --> 01:18:55.919
No.

01:18:56.021 --> 01:19:00.356
I never know
how to answer that.

01:19:00.457 --> 01:19:02.891
I'm sure you're doing
just fine.

01:19:06.294 --> 01:19:08.329
You do this a lot,

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:12.232
counsel victims of kidnapping?

01:19:12.333 --> 01:19:15.701
Not specifically.

01:19:15.802 --> 01:19:17.903
Me neither.

01:19:18.004 --> 01:19:21.105
But I'm sure
you're doing just fine.

01:19:25.176 --> 01:19:28.344
Well, I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

01:19:31.314 --> 01:19:32.748
If I could just
see Leanne now,

01:19:32.849 --> 01:19:34.182
I'll be on my way.

01:19:34.283 --> 01:19:38.185
Oh, yes, right.

01:19:38.286 --> 01:19:40.888
Not for long,
just to touch base.

01:19:40.989 --> 01:19:43.723
I'd love to hear
about your vacation.

01:19:43.824 --> 01:19:45.992
I'm sure it was
great for her.

01:20:13.747 --> 01:20:15.748
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

01:20:15.849 --> 01:20:17.650
three Mississippi,
four Mississippi,

01:20:17.751 --> 01:20:19.617
five Mississippi,
six Mississippi...

01:20:28.392 --> 01:20:32.394
58 Mississippi,
59 Mississippi...

01:20:32.495 --> 01:20:34.229
60.

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:44.771
So she's... she's sleeping.

01:20:44.872 --> 01:20:46.939
I... I... I tried to wake her,

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:49.774
but she's just too feverish
to come down.

01:20:49.875 --> 01:20:51.676
Of course, her bronchitis.

01:20:51.777 --> 01:20:55.312
Yes, it'll have to be
another time.

01:20:55.413 --> 01:20:58.681
Thursday, her regular time.

01:20:58.782 --> 01:21:02.451
Yes, right, Thursday.

01:21:02.552 --> 01:21:03.952
Great.

01:21:06.422 --> 01:21:07.489
Bermuda.

01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:09.656
Bermuda.

01:21:09.758 --> 01:21:10.991
Barracuda's a fish.

01:21:11.092 --> 01:21:12.692
Okay.

01:21:16.729 --> 01:21:19.965
What was your favorite part?

01:21:20.066 --> 01:21:21.133
We went on a boat.

01:21:21.233 --> 01:21:22.767
Good.

01:21:22.868 --> 01:21:24.268
I've never been on a boat.

01:21:24.369 --> 01:21:25.469
I know.

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:28.805
What if she asks
why I like it?

01:21:28.906 --> 01:21:30.272
You just tell her
you like the water.

01:21:30.373 --> 01:21:33.275
But what if I don't
like the water?

01:21:33.376 --> 01:21:34.276
Do you?

01:21:34.377 --> 01:21:36.778
I don't know.

01:21:36.879 --> 01:21:40.547
I don't want to
answer these questions.

01:21:40.648 --> 01:21:44.049
I don't want you to
answer them either.

01:21:47.487 --> 01:21:50.288
How was the plane ride?

01:21:50.389 --> 01:21:51.389
It was scary.

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.157
Good.

01:21:53.258 --> 01:21:54.825
I don't get it.

01:21:54.926 --> 01:21:57.360
Why would people do
something scary on purpose?

01:21:57.461 --> 01:21:59.061
It's not actually scary.

01:21:59.163 --> 01:22:00.630
It's just, some people
think that it's scary.

01:22:00.731 --> 01:22:02.798
Do you?

01:22:02.899 --> 01:22:03.799
Not really.

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.634
Then why do I?

01:22:06.735 --> 01:22:09.403
Because you've never
been on a plane before.

01:22:09.504 --> 01:22:11.171
But the boat wasn't scary.

01:22:11.272 --> 01:22:12.338
No.

01:22:12.439 --> 01:22:14.541
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:22:18.244 --> 01:22:21.145
I'm sorry.

01:22:21.246 --> 01:22:25.582
Why don't you have a tan?

01:22:25.683 --> 01:22:27.751
I wore a sun screen.

01:22:27.852 --> 01:22:31.086
One word, "sunscreen. "

01:22:31.188 --> 01:22:32.354
I wore a sunscreen.

01:22:32.455 --> 01:22:35.056
Not "a," just "sunscreen. "

01:22:35.157 --> 01:22:36.758
"I wore sunscreen. "

01:22:36.859 --> 01:22:39.059
It's... it's a lotion.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.895
I wore sunscreen.

01:22:42.996 --> 01:22:43.896
That's good.

01:22:43.997 --> 01:22:45.364
I... I...

01:22:45.465 --> 01:22:46.599
I think that's good for today.

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:47.866
I think we should...

01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:49.334
we'll practice more
tomorrow, yeah?

01:22:49.435 --> 01:22:50.902
Okay.

01:22:54.206 --> 01:22:58.575
What happens
if I get them wrong?

01:22:58.676 --> 01:23:00.742
I'm just trying to do my best

01:23:00.844 --> 01:23:03.078
to protect you.

01:23:05.347 --> 01:23:07.381
From what?

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.883
Why do you ask
so many questions

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:14.420
and you still don't know
what a barracuda is?

01:23:14.521 --> 01:23:16.088
I know what it is now.

01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:17.456
It's a fish.

01:23:20.893 --> 01:23:22.460
Let's move on.

01:23:26.664 --> 01:23:28.164
What's next?

01:23:33.369 --> 01:23:35.070
Beads.

01:23:35.171 --> 01:23:37.872
I think that we're gonna
try something new.

01:23:51.383 --> 01:23:54.818
Applied accountability.

01:23:54.919 --> 01:23:57.587
What's applied accountability?

01:23:57.688 --> 01:24:00.489
I fall, you fall.

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:04.058
I succeed, you succeed.

01:24:06.829 --> 01:24:11.431
So, how are you feeling about
the changes in the house?

01:24:11.532 --> 01:24:13.966
Which changes?

01:24:14.067 --> 01:24:17.103
Glen being gone.

01:24:17.204 --> 01:24:18.670
Okay, I guess.

01:24:18.771 --> 01:24:21.306
Are there other changes?

01:24:21.407 --> 01:24:23.841
Has your relationship
with Marcy changed at all

01:24:23.942 --> 01:24:25.476
since he's been gone?

01:24:29.113 --> 01:24:31.914
Can we talk about
something else?

01:24:33.883 --> 01:24:36.651
What about your vacation?

01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:40.487
Good.

01:24:40.588 --> 01:24:42.589
It was good.

01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:43.890
Good.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.127
I used a sunscreen.

01:24:49.228 --> 01:24:51.229
It's a lotion.

01:24:59.269 --> 01:25:03.939
What about your relationship
with Mr. McKay?

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:06.675
We're not allowed
to have a relationship.

01:25:06.776 --> 01:25:08.876
And do you still want one?

01:25:12.279 --> 01:25:15.281
That doesn't have to be
a yes-or-no question.

01:25:15.382 --> 01:25:20.618
It's natural to feel conflicted
about Mr. McKay.

01:25:20.719 --> 01:25:23.521
Ben.

01:25:23.622 --> 01:25:27.157
Ben.

01:25:27.258 --> 01:25:29.892
You always say that.

01:25:29.993 --> 01:25:32.061
What?

01:25:32.162 --> 01:25:35.029
That it's natural

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.999
to feel conflicted
about my feelings.

01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:40.701
And it is.

01:25:40.802 --> 01:25:42.669
But how can you have feelings
about something

01:25:42.770 --> 01:25:45.404
when you don't know
anything about it?

01:25:45.505 --> 01:25:49.374
Is that how you feel about him?

01:25:49.475 --> 01:25:51.643
That's how I feel
about everything.

01:25:55.747 --> 01:25:58.848
Okay, all right.

01:25:58.949 --> 01:26:01.917
I'll let you get settled in.

01:26:02.018 --> 01:26:05.520
Water's in a half an hour.

01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:17.830
Is this how people love?

01:26:17.931 --> 01:26:19.497
They become a room
for you to live in,

01:26:19.598 --> 01:26:21.766
and then they lock?

01:26:24.302 --> 01:26:27.471
How many rooms do you get
in your life?

01:26:30.374 --> 01:26:32.575
Am I lucky or unlucky?

01:26:36.145 --> 01:26:38.512
I'm really asking.

01:26:42.216 --> 01:26:43.950
We're both lucky.

01:27:52.004 --> 01:27:55.038
I... I have something for you.

01:27:58.176 --> 01:28:00.976
I have to go and get it.

01:28:01.078 --> 01:28:02.445
Where is it?

01:28:02.546 --> 01:28:03.945
It's downstairs.

01:28:04.046 --> 01:28:05.814
We are downstairs.

01:28:05.915 --> 01:28:07.648
It's in the basement.

01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:10.751
Is it alive?

01:28:10.852 --> 01:28:12.452
No.

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.087
Okay.

01:28:29.900 --> 01:28:33.869
I'm gonna trust you.

01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:35.536
Okay, good.

01:29:22.241 --> 01:29:24.875
17 years, the singular window
in the basement

01:29:24.976 --> 01:29:26.409
was sealed and covered,

01:29:26.511 --> 01:29:29.645
making it impossible
to see in or out.

01:29:29.746 --> 01:29:32.047
Neighbors said they never
noticed anything unusual

01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:34.983
about Benjamin McKay
or his basement.

01:29:35.084 --> 01:29:40.554
He kept to himself mostly.

01:29:40.655 --> 01:29:43.322
We'd always say hello
if we happened into each other,

01:29:43.423 --> 01:29:45.925
but, you know, I mean,

01:29:46.026 --> 01:29:48.927
never mentioned family,
never had anyone over.

01:29:49.028 --> 01:29:51.329
I mean, he was always alone.

01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:53.697
At least we thought
he was alone.

01:29:53.798 --> 01:29:57.534
No one knows how much time McKay
himself spent in the basement,

01:29:57.635 --> 01:29:59.235
though there was just one bed

01:29:59.336 --> 01:30:02.070
fashioned out of a camping cot
wrapped in blankets.

01:30:02.172 --> 01:30:04.239
The bedding is being tested
for DNA,

01:30:04.340 --> 01:30:06.240
and thus far the results
of those tests

01:30:06.341 --> 01:30:08.176
have not been released.

01:30:08.277 --> 01:30:10.277
What will happen
at this museum of captivity

01:30:10.378 --> 01:30:13.346
at 111 Langston Road
is yet to be determined,

01:30:13.447 --> 01:30:15.381
as the relics of a life underground

01:30:15.482 --> 01:30:17.383
wait to be claimed.

01:30:17.484 --> 01:30:18.583
Truly horrifying.

01:30:18.684 --> 01:30:21.419
For 21 News, I'm Juan Fernandez.

01:30:50.842 --> 01:30:53.344
This is a stationary bicycle.

01:30:53.445 --> 01:30:56.346
You ride it in place,

01:30:56.447 --> 01:30:59.381
like... like this.

01:31:01.418 --> 01:31:02.985
See?

01:31:03.086 --> 01:31:05.653
And... it stays up by itself,

01:31:05.754 --> 01:31:09.990
so you don't have to wear
a helmet or anything,

01:31:10.091 --> 01:31:14.126
and you can change the speeds
with these dials.

01:31:14.228 --> 01:31:16.462
I...

01:31:16.563 --> 01:31:18.530
I found it downstairs.

01:31:21.033 --> 01:31:23.267
Here, get on.

01:31:23.368 --> 01:31:25.269
Now you just... you pedal.

01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:30.773
You push down with your feet.

01:31:30.873 --> 01:31:33.675
Yes, like that.

01:31:33.776 --> 01:31:35.543
Next week is a solitary block,

01:31:35.644 --> 01:31:39.547
and I thought it would be nice
for you to have something to do.

01:32:48.267 --> 01:32:50.201
Dear Marcy,

01:32:50.303 --> 01:32:52.836
thank you for caring about me,

01:32:52.937 --> 01:32:55.005
for trying.

01:32:55.106 --> 01:32:57.674
The idea that you can fight
for something you want

01:32:57.775 --> 01:32:59.609
is new to me.

01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:01.243
I thought before

01:33:01.344 --> 01:33:04.046
that you only fought
against things you didn't.

01:33:04.147 --> 01:33:07.748
But now I know there are
different ways of doing it.

01:33:07.849 --> 01:33:11.551
It's not that I don't
not love you specifically.

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:14.753
I maybe don't love anyone,
maybe.

01:33:14.854 --> 01:33:17.623
Or maybe that doesn't matter.

01:33:17.724 --> 01:33:19.357
I'd say I wish
I could be different,

01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:21.359
but I don't.

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:24.561
I don't know
what that would be.

01:33:24.662 --> 01:33:27.764
I'm sorry I don't remember you
from before,

01:33:27.865 --> 01:33:31.467
but I'll remember you now.

01:33:31.568 --> 01:33:34.536
I didn't leave
because you were bad.

01:33:34.637 --> 01:33:36.938
The whole point of taking
everything away from me

01:33:37.039 --> 01:33:38.238
in the first place

01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:41.642
was that I would
get to be someone.

01:33:41.743 --> 01:33:45.778
I mean, I am someone,
when I'm alone.

01:33:45.879 --> 01:33:48.480
But when I'm with other people,

01:33:48.581 --> 01:33:51.282
I am what they think I am.

01:33:51.383 --> 01:33:53.317
I don't know how to be that.

01:33:53.418 --> 01:33:58.955
And I think I don't want to be
something to share anymore.

01:33:59.056 --> 01:34:00.823
I thought you couldn't
choose your family

01:34:00.924 --> 01:34:04.992
and that you were trying
to make me choose you.

01:34:05.094 --> 01:34:08.596
But then I saw
that Ben chose me.

01:34:08.697 --> 01:34:11.765
He picked me out,
and he made me his.

01:34:11.866 --> 01:34:14.967
And there is no one
choosing that.

01:34:15.068 --> 01:34:20.405
There is no un-growing up.

01:34:20.506 --> 01:34:26.276
It's time for me
to grow up for good...

01:34:26.378 --> 01:34:29.412
and have something that's mine.

01:34:31.848 --> 01:34:33.882
And mine only.

01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:50.461
Sincerely, Leia.
