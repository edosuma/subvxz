WEBVTT

00:05.959 --> 00:08.959
(Simon) OK, right, OK...

00:09.679 --> 00:12.679
You've got a terminal illness...

00:13.119 --> 00:16.119
but you get to shag Angelina Jolie.

00:16.320 --> 00:19.320
Or... you've won the Lottery...

00:21.080 --> 00:24.080
but you have to shag Su Pollard

00:24.520 --> 00:27.239
and that fucking Welsh one.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.679
Bastard.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.680
Pollard and the Welsh one.

00:39.080 --> 00:42.080
(Susan) Welcome back.

00:42.639 --> 00:47.079
Shame you didn't give this to me earlier.
Everyone could have admired it.

00:47.079 --> 00:51.519
At the inset day you were supposed to
come to while you were on a beach?

00:51.519 --> 00:54.199
(Simon) Why did you do that?
(Susan) What?

00:54.199 --> 00:57.419
Mention work.
We're trying to enjoy ourselves.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.320
(Sighs) Don't wanna go
to school tomorrow.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.799
- Ahhh.
- (Brian) I do.

01:03.799 --> 01:06.000
(Simon) I hate the first day back.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.919
I get this kind of... knot here.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.799
It's that feeling when you know
everything's gonna be the same.

01:12.799 --> 01:16.719
Same old faces, same students,
same old fucking routine.

01:18.159 --> 01:21.040
It's against the rules
for the first day back

01:21.040 --> 01:24.079
to be anything less than
misery and torture.

01:24.079 --> 01:27.299
- Look on the bright side.
- (Simon) Which is?

01:27.839 --> 01:29.478
No...

01:29.479 --> 01:32.479
there isn't one.

01:43.360 --> 01:46.360
(Siren)

02:11.039 --> 02:12.718
Morning.

02:12.719 --> 02:14.959
Don't be so cheerful.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.438
Sorry.

02:17.439 --> 02:20.439
- There is a reason for it.
- Insanity.

02:21.359 --> 02:25.069
- I just got my decree absolute through.
- Excellent.

02:25.239 --> 02:27.798
(Simon) I mean, like, are you OK?

02:27.799 --> 02:30.119
(Chuckles) Fine.

02:30.120 --> 02:34.320
Now, can we get back to taking the piss
out of Brian's suit?

02:34.759 --> 02:36.599
What's wrong with it?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.318
(Simon) Oi, you lot!

02:38.319 --> 02:41.889
If you want to piss about,
do it in the playground.

02:43.519 --> 02:46.519
Are you deaf?

02:51.719 --> 02:54.719
Oh, fuck, I forgot about her.

02:55.039 --> 02:58.039
You're gonna have to talk
to her sometime.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.520
Jenny!

03:09.359 --> 03:12.359
- All right?
- Fine, thanks.

03:12.560 --> 03:15.560
Great.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.600
- Shall I say it for you?
- Say what?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.958
Yeah. Yeah, go on, then.

03:23.959 --> 03:27.840
Whatever twisted spark of attraction
there was between us

03:27.840 --> 03:30.990
has now thankfully gone
since we had sex, OK?

03:32.400 --> 03:35.400
Yeah. Yeah.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.840
- (Howling wind)
- Go on, then.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.718
After you.

03:43.719 --> 03:45.839
Last here, first in.

03:45.840 --> 03:48.840
Me?

03:49.760 --> 03:52.760
(Echoing, distorted voices)

04:00.600 --> 04:02.039
(Screaming)

04:02.039 --> 04:04.359
- Student assessments.
- Mark by Friday.

04:04.359 --> 04:07.999
- Memo for the new term.
- Fill them in by tomorrow.

04:15.159 --> 04:18.159
Ready?

04:28.160 --> 04:31.800
Look, she's had a make-over done
especially for you.

04:32.399 --> 04:35.399
She looks like a little pineapple.

04:43.839 --> 04:46.839
Holy fuck, who's she?

04:52.040 --> 04:55.040
This is Simon, Kurt, Brian. This is Penny.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.118
(Grunts)

04:58.119 --> 05:00.720
(Jenny) I'm Penny's mentor for the year.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.200
Just for your information,
I've shagged Brian and Simon.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.770
I'd recommend Brian.
More fun and less complicated.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.960
What do you mean, "more fun"?

05:13.960 --> 05:17.520
Not that I'm bothered,
just so I know for next time...

05:17.520 --> 05:20.670
- I don't mean with you...
- See what I mean?

05:29.160 --> 05:32.160
What did you do that was so special?

05:37.119 --> 05:40.269
I just wanted to say,
welcome back, everyone.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.799
Why's Clare with that sixth-former?

05:42.799 --> 05:44.998
There's nothing major to report

05:44.999 --> 05:49.799
other than it looks like Angie
won't be back for at least six months.

05:49.799 --> 05:53.509
For those of you with new tutor groups,
see me later.

05:53.920 --> 05:57.559
I'm sure you're all as excited as I am
about this new school year.

05:57.559 --> 06:00.239
Let's work on our achievements so far

06:00.240 --> 06:04.040
and really push to make this year
better than the last.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.960
- I know you won't let me down.
- No pressure there, then.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.759
I'm sure you three have a good
explanation for being absent yesterday?

06:11.759 --> 06:14.759
(All) Our flight was delayed.

06:15.919 --> 06:19.629
This is our new languages teacher,
John-Paul Keating.

06:21.799 --> 06:24.759
JP's in your old room
and you're in Jenny's room.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.158
What? I mean... why?

06:27.159 --> 06:30.159
Change is the enemy of complacency.

06:31.919 --> 06:34.599
What does she mean?
I'm not complacent.

06:34.599 --> 06:37.599
(Brian) You're a lazy twat. Same thing.

06:39.479 --> 06:43.959
Carol can't wait to see what
you brought her back from Tenerife.

06:46.039 --> 06:49.039
S-See you later...

06:53.199 --> 06:55.198
For fuck's sake.

06:55.199 --> 06:59.749
I ignore her all summer,
she still thinks I'm going out with her.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.960
What is it about me, d'you think?

07:03.960 --> 07:07.120
Must be that look you've got,
the one that says,

07:07.120 --> 07:11.880
"I'm desperate, permanently available
and no one else will have me."

07:13.400 --> 07:16.400
(Bell)

07:19.120 --> 07:21.360
You never mentioned him last night.

07:21.360 --> 07:24.120
I thought it would be
a nice surprise for you,

07:24.120 --> 07:27.519
as you were whingeing about
everything being the same.

07:27.519 --> 07:30.519
- He looks about 12.
- Not bad-looking, though.

07:30.519 --> 07:33.759
Wait till he hits puberty,
he'll be covered in spots.

07:33.759 --> 07:36.759
In fact, he's quite attractive.

07:37.159 --> 07:41.319
(Sighs) I don't know why Clare
moved me to Jenny's old room.

07:41.319 --> 07:44.319
You moan about things being the same,

07:44.360 --> 07:46.840
something changes
and you moan even more.

07:46.840 --> 07:49.840
- I know, but it was... my room.
- Ahh.

07:51.199 --> 07:54.979
Do you want me to go with you
into your new classroom?

07:55.480 --> 07:58.910
Actually, he's more than attractive,
he's lovely.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.158
Well, he is.

08:03.159 --> 08:06.159
Stop staring, it's... rude.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.120
- Got everything you need, JP?
- I think so, thanks.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.878
What's up with you?

08:24.879 --> 08:28.440
- "Got everything you need, JP?"
- Just being friendly.

08:28.440 --> 08:30.959
- Yeah, right.
- What's that supposed to mean?

08:30.959 --> 08:33.958
Nothing, it's just the way you said it.

08:37.759 --> 08:40.999
I can't find the register.
Should I see the secretary?

08:40.999 --> 08:43.438
If you don't mind an interrogation.

08:43.438 --> 08:45.999
- I'll get one for you.
- No, it's OK.

08:45.999 --> 08:49.499
- Leave it with me.
- Thanks. Drop it in whenever.

08:52.639 --> 08:54.179
- What?
- Look at you!

08:54.960 --> 08:57.518
- What?
- You've gone all red!

08:57.519 --> 08:59.879
- You fancy him, don't you?
- No.

08:59.880 --> 09:04.360
Why have your pupils gone really big?
I bet you've got palpitations.

09:04.360 --> 09:07.079
- You'll be breaking out in a sweat.
- Stop it!

09:07.079 --> 09:09.520
- You fancy him!
- Of course I don't.

09:09.520 --> 09:13.119
I can't - it's me we're talking about.
I never fancy anyone.

09:13.119 --> 09:16.119
- You fancied Peter once.
- I suppose.

09:16.520 --> 09:20.600
I bet you went red, got palpitations
and ran after him going,

09:20.600 --> 09:23.680
- "Got everything you need?"
- No, I didn't.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.490
- Well, now you mention it...
- There you go, then.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.119
Showing all the classic symptoms
of fancying someone.

09:33.119 --> 09:34.998
Am I?

09:34.999 --> 09:37.999
Oh, God, maybe I am.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.678
Fucking hell!

09:40.679 --> 09:43.679
Oh, that's all I need.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.320
OK!

09:49.839 --> 09:53.059
Sit down, shut up,
stop enjoying yourselves...

09:57.360 --> 10:00.360
Someone say... something?

10:00.839 --> 10:03.839
(All) Morning, sir.

10:04.600 --> 10:07.600
Morning.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.960

10:30.520 --> 10:33.679
When I arrived,
it took me a year to find the canteen.

10:33.679 --> 10:36.960
Maybe you shouldn't
be teaching geography, then?

10:36.960 --> 10:39.960
- That's very good, Kylie.
- Kay-la.

10:41.239 --> 10:45.019
All right, Katherine with a K,
tell me about yourself.

10:46.439 --> 10:48.479

- (Giggling)
- Something more interesting than this?

11:36.719 --> 11:39.399
No, we were talking about you.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.559
She said you live with two blokes,

11:41.559 --> 11:44.799
I thought you might be gay
but Kayla says you're not.

11:44.799 --> 11:48.019
You haven't got a girlfriend though,
have you?

11:48.279 --> 11:51.279
- I might have.
- Who is she, then?

11:53.480 --> 11:56.480
Her name is...

11:57.119 --> 12:00.119
Rio.

12:00.759 --> 12:03.759
And she's... very attractive.

12:07.439 --> 12:10.439
Any questions so far?

12:13.280 --> 12:16.280
(♪ Stravinsky: The Rite Of Spring)

12:25.439 --> 12:27.559
- Is she your girlfriend now?
- No.

12:27.559 --> 12:30.559
- (Laughter)
- (Bell)

12:36.559 --> 12:39.559
That sound you can hear is the bell.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.280
Which means you can go.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.759
- Lost?
- I'm looking for the library.

12:58.759 --> 13:01.399
Er, it's that way.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.400
Thanks.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.000
Could've been worse -
it could've said "Don't shag me".

13:11.000 --> 13:13.719
Getting to be a habit, this -
you helping me out.

13:13.719 --> 13:15.679
Don't worry, I do it for everyone.

13:15.679 --> 13:18.720
If you ever need personal counselling,
come to me.

13:18.720 --> 13:22.010
- And I'm very cheap.
- I'll bear that in mind.

13:22.960 --> 13:25.960
So, who do you go to
if you need advice?

13:26.160 --> 13:29.160
Er, if I'm absolutely desperate, Simon...

13:29.480 --> 13:34.119
but I'd have to be really, really desperate,
in fact, completely mental!

13:34.119 --> 13:36.719
Which is how I'm coming across
right now?

13:36.719 --> 13:40.240
- You're not.
- You're being polite cos you're new.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.950
No, you don't strike me
as being particularly mental.

13:52.119 --> 13:54.558
- All right?
- No, not really.

13:54.559 --> 13:58.409
I've got the fucking Midwich Cuckoos
for a tutor group.

13:59.199 --> 14:00.958
So, what's your problem?

14:00.959 --> 14:03.479
- Bit complicated.
- Oh, right.

14:03.480 --> 14:07.679
Not only do I think I fancy him
but I quite like him as well.

14:07.679 --> 14:10.119
- And?
- That's the problem, isn't it?

14:10.119 --> 14:12.398
- Is it?
- Yes!

14:12.399 --> 14:15.360
It would be fine
if he was a complete bastard

14:15.360 --> 14:18.520
but he's not,
which just messes everything up.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.000
Bollocks, why does he have to be nice?

14:21.000 --> 14:24.279
- He could be a spare-time bastard.
- And he's really fit.

14:24.279 --> 14:28.240
Say something to reassure me
this isn't really happening.

14:28.240 --> 14:32.160
You're Susan, you're the sensible one,
you don't lech after people,

14:32.160 --> 14:34.280
you tell us not to lech after people.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.280
- Better?
- Yeah, thanks.

14:40.559 --> 14:43.559
Did he... look at me? Just then?

15:02.680 --> 15:05.680
(♪ Stravinsky: The Rite Of Spring))

15:19.279 --> 15:21.399
She's out there.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.400
- Who?
- Carol.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.680
I keep seeing her everywhere.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.240
Shouldn't you be doing that
in a phone box?

15:32.240 --> 15:35.240
Piss off.

15:35.800 --> 15:38.558
All right?

15:38.559 --> 15:41.559
So. So... you know.

15:42.199 --> 15:45.158
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

15:45.159 --> 15:48.159
Good.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.039
Seems all right, doesn't he?

16:15.040 --> 16:17.719
Will you tell her
I don't want to go out with her?

16:17.719 --> 16:20.719
I'm too scared.

16:21.439 --> 16:24.439
No chance.

16:28.639 --> 16:31.859
- Let's go and talk to them.
- It's home time.

16:31.999 --> 16:34.999
Come on, we can invite them to the pub.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.680
We just thought we'd come
and say hello

16:44.680 --> 16:46.160
and see how you got on today.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.598
First days are always the worst,

16:48.599 --> 16:51.400
you never know who to talk to,
who to avoid.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.810
I remember on my first day
I was too nervous to talk to anyone.

16:58.479 --> 17:02.119
Well, obviously, I said hello...
(Giggles nervously)

17:07.959 --> 17:10.959
See you tomorrow.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.400
Nice t-to talk to you...

17:18.000 --> 17:19.200
Ow!

17:19.200 --> 17:21.199
Does she really teach psychology?

17:21.199 --> 17:24.640
Ah, she's not that bad.
I think she's quite sweet.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.999
What is wrong with me?

17:27.000 --> 17:31.520
I try and have a normal conversation
with him and I end up talking bollocks.

17:31.520 --> 17:34.919
I'm sure he didn't notice
that you made a twat of yourself

17:34.919 --> 17:36.919
and forgot to ask him for a drink.

17:36.919 --> 17:39.678
See? I can't even get that right.

17:39.679 --> 17:41.718
Ask who for a drink?

17:41.719 --> 17:45.359
If you tell them,
I'll make your life a living hell.

17:45.679 --> 17:47.558
Sorry, I can't say.

17:47.559 --> 17:49.879
- (Mouthing)
- (Both) JP?!

17:49.880 --> 17:52.239
You fancy JP?

17:52.240 --> 17:55.240
I fucking hate you, Simon Casey.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.400
(Beeping)

18:01.320 --> 18:04.320
That was her.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.360
Help me, I need advice.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.320
- Never wear orange.
- You're late.

18:11.559 --> 18:14.569
Been busy sacrificing
small children again?

18:14.720 --> 18:19.060
No, Bob wanted to talk to me
about extracurricular activities.

18:19.159 --> 18:22.589
- I told him you'd volunteered to help.
- Cheers.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.640
So, what's the verdict on JP and Penny?

18:27.039 --> 18:29.078
Un-fucking-believable.

18:29.079 --> 18:32.599
I could always take over as her mentor
if you couldn't cope.

18:32.599 --> 18:35.839
I don't think so.
We're encouraging her into teaching,

18:35.839 --> 18:38.880
- not putting her off.
- I wouldn't try to put her off.

18:38.880 --> 18:42.100
I know, you'd do it
without any effort at all.

18:42.559 --> 18:44.759
Susan fancies JP.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.440
Why don't you just tell the entire pub?

18:47.440 --> 18:49.838
No, they wouldn't know who JP is.

18:49.839 --> 18:51.879
- And?
- And nothing.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.559
I just fancy him, that's all. No big deal.

18:54.559 --> 18:56.600
If I think about it rationally

18:56.600 --> 19:00.400
it's probably just a reaction
to finding out about my divorce.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.879
- I won't do anything about it.
- Why not?

19:02.879 --> 19:04.798
Don't encourage her.

19:04.799 --> 19:08.839
Because I've just got used to my life
being nice and uncomplicated,

19:08.839 --> 19:11.640
why go and mess it up
by going out with JP?

19:11.640 --> 19:13.798
God, I can't stand this.

19:13.799 --> 19:17.880
I've just met him
and I'm talking about going out with him.

19:17.880 --> 19:20.278
Well, he is good-looking.

19:20.279 --> 19:23.279
Yeah, he is, isn't he? Shit.

19:23.319 --> 19:27.099
Anyway, he's probably not interested.
Why would he be?

19:29.679 --> 19:33.529
In fact... I don't think
he's really noticed me at all.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.240
That's cos you're not a proper girl.

19:37.240 --> 19:39.840
What's that supposed to mean?
I'm a bloke?

19:39.840 --> 19:42.840
No, I mean... you're like us.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.720
- (Brian) That's why we like you.
- Stop. You're depressing me.

19:49.720 --> 19:52.720
No, all I'm trying to say is...

19:53.360 --> 19:56.400
maybe if you did your hair
a bit different or...

19:56.400 --> 19:59.900
wore a bit more make-up,
he might notice you more.

20:00.439 --> 20:03.439
Do you think?

20:04.400 --> 20:08.530
God, what is happening to me?
I'm taking advice from Brian.

20:10.679 --> 20:12.399
Help me.

20:12.400 --> 20:15.360
You could run round the staff room
with a machete,

20:15.360 --> 20:19.319
- he might take notice then.
- Oh, fuck it. What have I got to lose?

20:19.319 --> 20:21.600
You're going to run round
with a machete?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.600
No.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.880
I'm going to dress up like a girl.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.838
(Simon) Lovely.

20:29.839 --> 20:32.839
(Kurt) Hey!
(Brian) Super!

20:46.600 --> 20:49.600
(Wolf whistle)

20:50.440 --> 20:53.440
(Laughter)

21:06.720 --> 21:09.720
Wasting your time there. She's celibate.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.400
- How do you know?
- It's my job to know.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.670
I heard she was married.
How can she be celibate and married?

21:16.679 --> 21:19.880
If she was married to someone like you,
it's possible.

21:19.880 --> 21:22.560
Anyway, I'm only saying what I've heard.

21:22.560 --> 21:24.879
Has Kurt said anything about Carol?

21:24.879 --> 21:27.839
- We don't talk about stuff like that.
- Really?

21:27.839 --> 21:32.159
I'd have thought you'd be full
of good advice about relationships.

21:32.159 --> 21:35.159
- How's your girlfriend? Rio?
- What?

22:01.039 --> 22:02.880
Have you been talking about me?

22:02.880 --> 22:06.199
Yeah, I've been telling everyone
how brilliant you are.

22:06.199 --> 22:09.439
- You don't have to be sarky.
- I know but it's fun.

22:09.439 --> 22:12.939
- Why would I talk to anyone about you?
- I dunno.

22:12.959 --> 22:17.239
Maybe you might have said something
to another teacher or someone else.

22:17.239 --> 22:20.239
No. I can if you want me to, though.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.440
Not really.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.399
No, you look fine.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.400
I've got a message for you - from Carol.

23:52.080 --> 23:54.278
She's busy with Clare.

23:54.279 --> 23:58.549
She told me to tell you to meet her
in the canteen for lunch.

23:59.199 --> 24:00.699
(Sighs) Right.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.919
- Can't I just email her?
- That's cowardly.

24:07.919 --> 24:10.919
And we don't get the pleasure
of seeing you squirm.

24:10.919 --> 24:12.759
Cheers.

24:12.760 --> 24:16.719
Deep down, you're really scared
of being dumped yourself.

24:16.719 --> 24:19.719
Why would she want to dump me?

24:20.319 --> 24:22.318
No, it would take too long.

24:22.319 --> 24:25.319
- Shall we just do it, then?
- OK.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.920
- So, I'm Carol.
- (Kurt tuts)

24:34.120 --> 24:36.118
- (Groans)
- Sorry.

24:36.119 --> 24:38.239
Go on, then.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.670
Don't do that,
she'll think you've got emphysema.

24:43.239 --> 24:46.238
The thing is, Carol.

24:46.239 --> 24:49.239
The thing is...

24:49.319 --> 24:51.679
It's over.

24:51.680 --> 24:54.680
Nice. Subtle.

24:55.359 --> 24:58.359
But try starting with something positive.

25:02.199 --> 25:05.199
Hi, Carol. Nice... shoes.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.510
- You've done this before, haven't you?
- No.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.400
Er, something like...

25:16.200 --> 25:18.199
"Carol, you mean a lot to me."

25:18.199 --> 25:21.199
Carol, you mean a lot to me.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.680
"And I've realised
I can't go on pretending

25:25.680 --> 25:29.600
"that our relationship
is any more than just friendship.

25:30.720 --> 25:34.780
"It's not fair, which is...
why I can't see you any more."

25:36.600 --> 25:38.959
Yeah. Sounds all right.

25:38.960 --> 25:41.919
(Kurt) Do you think it'll work?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.920
(Susan) Probably not.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.798
Good luck.

25:47.799 --> 25:50.799
Hang on.

25:51.720 --> 25:54.239
(Susan) I don't think I need to be there.

25:54.239 --> 25:58.089
- Hi! Canteen sandwich? Risky.
- Thought I'd chance it.

25:58.160 --> 26:01.080
I am going the right way
for Clare's office?

26:01.080 --> 26:03.198
Er, it's that way.

26:03.199 --> 26:05.559
- Close.

26:08.720 --> 26:11.720
Actually, it's easier if I show you.

26:11.999 --> 26:14.599
Susan!

26:14.600 --> 26:17.320
I think she wants to give me
a little pep talk.

26:17.320 --> 26:19.279
- Bad luck.
- Is she that bad?

26:19.279 --> 26:22.399
Not if you have absolutely nothing
to do with her.

26:22.399 --> 26:24.279
Anything else I should know?

26:24.279 --> 26:28.129
Er... Yeah, when you're in there,
speak really quietly.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.399
Liz won't be able to listen in
like she always does.

26:33.399 --> 26:36.549
- It'll really piss her off.
- You've, erm...

26:36.719 --> 26:39.719
- You've smudged your make-up.
- Have I?

26:39.920 --> 26:43.519
I can never get my head round
why girls wear so much make-up.

26:43.519 --> 26:46.809
Obviously, some of them have to.
But you don't.

26:47.639 --> 26:50.599
- Really?
- Yeah. Shit, I'm late...

26:50.600 --> 26:52.359
Er, I know the way from here.

26:52.359 --> 26:54.319

- Did I miss all the fun?
- He walked into a fight. I've sorted it.

29:00.960 --> 29:03.399
- (Liz) Well done.
- I just stepped in and...

29:03.399 --> 29:07.799
Clare asked me to get you. Wants the
minutes of the meeting this morning.

29:07.799 --> 29:10.638
Sorry to drag her away from you.

I've got mad cow's disease."

- (Bell)
- You can stop now, children.

29:24.399 --> 29:27.399
I haven't finished the moustache yet.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.480
Well... what do I do next?

29:36.639 --> 29:39.639

Simon?

29:44.079 --> 29:47.789

Stop it! Stop it!

29:51.519 --> 29:53.879
They... they said it was washable.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.879
She only does it when she's bored.

29:59.080 --> 30:01.519
- Thanks for that.
- It's all right.

30:01.519 --> 30:04.519
- You're supposed to be my friend.
- I am.

30:04.840 --> 30:08.759
Why can't you be a bit helpful
about this whole JP thing?

30:08.759 --> 30:11.199
- I have.
- No, you haven't.

30:11.200 --> 30:14.420
All right, you could try...
wearing stockings.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.920
What? Blokes like that sort of thing.

30:17.920 --> 30:22.330
- And they'll hide your knees.
- Will you leave my knees alone?

30:23.519 --> 30:27.560
- Why won't you take me seriously?
- That's not what I'm here for.

30:27.560 --> 30:31.600
- You know what I think it is?
- I still feel abandoned by my mother?

30:31.600 --> 30:34.120
No, though we could come back to that.

30:34.120 --> 30:37.399
It's because whenever you have
the smallest problem,

30:37.399 --> 30:39.598
I'm always there for you.

30:39.599 --> 30:44.279
But now I have a problem, all you see is
your emotional crutch being taken away.

30:44.279 --> 30:47.289
- Bollocks.
- I've clearly touched a nerve.

30:47.759 --> 30:50.120
All right, it might be about that a bit.

30:50.120 --> 30:52.358
Well, more than a bit.

30:52.359 --> 30:57.039
Why can't the world revolve around
someone other than you just this once?

30:57.039 --> 30:58.539
OK, I'm sorry.

30:59.159 --> 31:01.359
You are right.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.039
It's just that I don't think
I'm very good at this sort of thing.

31:05.039 --> 31:07.239
But... I'll try.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.240
- Will you?
- Of course.

31:11.679 --> 31:14.079
- What do I do?
- (Sighs)

31:14.080 --> 31:17.120
Do you want me to ask him out for you?
Get Brian to...

31:17.120 --> 31:20.120
Get Kurt to ask...?

31:20.159 --> 31:22.959
l-l-l could get Liz to ask...

31:22.960 --> 31:25.970
- Although she might ask...
- You're right.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.919
Really not your strong point.

31:39.399 --> 31:42.278
OK, you lot come in here today.

31:42.279 --> 31:44.719
It's a big change for you.

31:44.720 --> 31:48.220
New environment, new... people.
Is it good or bad?

31:51.480 --> 31:54.278
- Well bad.
- Right, so...

31:54.279 --> 31:57.279
change might be a bad thing.

31:57.759 --> 32:00.759
No, school is. Change is all right.

32:00.879 --> 32:05.119
But if you don't like the thing
that's changed, how do you deal with it?

32:05.119 --> 32:09.120
You just get on with it. What's this
got to do with what we're doing?

32:09.120 --> 32:12.620
I'm trying to make you...
look at things from a...

32:13.639 --> 32:16.199
a wider perspective.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.758
I was warned you'd be like this.

32:18.759 --> 32:21.759
- Like... what?
- Strange.

32:22.200 --> 32:25.490
- (Laughter)
- Right, you - move here. Come on.

32:25.800 --> 32:28.800
And you, there.

32:40.719 --> 32:43.479
There, you're right.

32:43.480 --> 32:46.770
That was a change
and that was good. Wasn't it?

32:53.639 --> 32:56.119
Fucking tragic.

32:56.120 --> 32:58.079
What?

32:58.080 --> 33:01.080
Penny. Apparently, she's celibate.

33:01.840 --> 33:04.480
Last time a woman told me
she was celibate,

33:04.480 --> 33:06.439
she went off with another woman.

33:06.439 --> 33:09.439
Maybe that's it then, eh?

33:11.840 --> 33:14.559
- What?
- Penny.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.560
Maybe she wears comfortable shoes.

33:21.039 --> 33:24.039
Maybe she likes kd lang.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.080
Hanging around in locker rooms.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.479
Maybe she prefers women.

33:30.480 --> 33:33.560
What, you mean she's a lezzer?
Fucking hell.

33:35.879 --> 33:38.878
No, it can't be true. She smiled at me.

33:38.879 --> 33:42.029
- She smiled at me.
- Shit, maybe it is true.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.880
Do you think Penny might be a dyke?

33:58.880 --> 34:02.439
If she's spoken to you,
she's probably giving it some thought.

34:02.439 --> 34:05.278
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

34:05.279 --> 34:06.839
- Helping you.
- What?

34:06.840 --> 34:09.840
Susan, can I borrow you for a minute?

34:15.958 --> 34:18.958
Hi! How's it going?

34:19.079 --> 34:22.079
- Great.
- Fine.

34:24.760 --> 34:27.760
You all right?

34:28.000 --> 34:31.000
(Sighs) I want to die.

34:32.000 --> 34:35.360
Great, so, er...
Do you like your new classroom?

34:36.199 --> 34:38.998
Yeah, it's fine, as classrooms go.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.000
Good, good. I'm glad you've settled in.

34:42.759 --> 34:45.759
You'll be OK, everyone's really nice here.

34:45.879 --> 34:48.879
- Aren't they?
- Are they?

34:50.719 --> 34:53.719
Susan's... Susan's really nice.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.719
- Another coffee?
- I'm OK, thanks.

34:59.719 --> 35:02.079
- Penny?
- Thanks, Brian. Two lumps.

35:02.079 --> 35:04.279
(Heartbeat)

35:04.280 --> 35:07.280
- Sorry?
- Of sugar.

35:08.639 --> 35:12.699
I'm not singling Susan out
or anything but she's really...

35:13.119 --> 35:16.119
really nice.

35:17.160 --> 35:19.559
If ever you've got a problem...

35:19.560 --> 35:22.279
Susan's the one to go to.

35:22.280 --> 35:25.198
- Really?
- Yeah, she's a good listener.

35:25.199 --> 35:28.199
Good...

35:28.880 --> 35:31.880
ears.

35:32.399 --> 35:34.798
- (Bell)
- Nice talking to you.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.799
- I'll see you later.
- (Both) Yeah.

35:40.519 --> 35:44.089
- What were you saying to him?
- I was helping you.

35:44.159 --> 35:46.919
- How?
- You know, I say a few nice things,

35:46.919 --> 35:50.560
he realises if someone like me
with obvious good taste

35:50.560 --> 35:53.239
thinks you're great,
then you must be all right.

35:53.239 --> 35:55.879
He takes the hint and asks you out.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.959
He thinks I draw on my knees.

35:57.960 --> 36:01.180
- It's not funny!
- Why don't you ask him out?

36:01.800 --> 36:04.480
- Don't be stupid.
- What could go wrong?

36:04.480 --> 36:06.639
He turns me down, I'm humiliated,

36:06.639 --> 36:09.200
it puts me off ever talking
to a fanciable bloke

36:09.200 --> 36:10.960
and I end up a lonely spinster.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.199
- Yes, be positive.
- What should I do?

36:13.199 --> 36:16.199
Just ask him, for fuck's sake.

36:16.639 --> 36:19.639
- Isn't there an easier way?
- No.

36:26.199 --> 36:29.199
Hi, sir.

36:30.359 --> 36:33.509
Susan, what was Exorcist Girl
doing in there?

36:33.600 --> 36:36.600
- Who?
- Her.

36:44.879 --> 36:47.879
(Dings bell)

36:48.399 --> 36:50.439
What's she been saying about me?

36:50.439 --> 36:53.480
Nothing, she's been
going on about Kurt all day.

36:53.480 --> 36:55.519
What?

36:55.520 --> 36:58.520
- Not Carol, Kayla.
- Kayla?

36:58.919 --> 37:02.159
She's been in to see Clare about me.
About my teaching.

37:02.159 --> 37:04.959
- Why would she do that?
- Because I know she has.

37:04.959 --> 37:07.358
And you know, you must have heard.

37:07.359 --> 37:10.579
That thing you said to me
before about... Rio.

37:10.639 --> 37:13.649
Me girlfriend. It came from her, didn't it?

37:13.879 --> 37:16.279
- That.
- I knew it.

37:16.280 --> 37:19.000
The little bitch keeps
taking the piss out of me.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.040
Even the way she smiles at me.

37:21.040 --> 37:23.919
She's been slagging off my teaching,
hasn't she?

37:23.919 --> 37:27.159
- Maybe I should see Clare.
- I wouldn't do that.

37:27.159 --> 37:28.718
Why not?

37:28.719 --> 37:31.279
She wouldn't know
what you were talking about.

37:31.279 --> 37:35.409
Best way to handle Kayla -
don't show she's getting to you.

37:35.599 --> 37:38.609
Hang on, who's the teacher here?
Me or you?

37:40.359 --> 37:43.359
You.

37:44.159 --> 37:47.159
That little bitch is my daughter.

37:49.599 --> 37:52.749
Still, she's lucky to be
in your tutor group.

37:54.040 --> 37:57.038
- And your geography class.
- Is she?

37:57.039 --> 38:00.889
Yeah. I know you'll help her
to get really good grades.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.039
- Go on, then.
- I can't.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.159
JP, Susan wanted to know...

38:17.160 --> 38:20.310
If you fancied coming
to the pub for a drink?

38:20.399 --> 38:23.399
Yeah, OK.

38:25.200 --> 38:28.560
I'm not going to ask him out
while you're there.

38:28.560 --> 38:30.599
Will you come with me?

38:30.600 --> 38:33.879
Why does everyone
always ask me to hold their hand? No.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.559
Uh?

38:35.560 --> 38:38.560
Go on, you can do it.

38:39.679 --> 38:42.679
Go on, mate. (Chuckles)

38:46.480 --> 38:49.480
- He'll never do it.
- I know.

38:56.039 --> 38:57.539
Come in, Kurt.

38:58.280 --> 39:02.520
Carol's just gone to the toilet.
Said something about an overdose

39:02.520 --> 39:05.240
- if you didn't come see her.
- You're joking!

39:05.240 --> 39:07.598
Yes, she won't be long.

39:07.599 --> 39:10.679
Er, actually,
it's you I needed to see, Liz.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.910
- Ooh, lucky me. What about?
- Erm... well...

39:16.040 --> 39:19.470
I don't know where to start really,
it's a bit...

39:20.119 --> 39:22.759
awkward.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.359
I knew it. You're thinking
of chucking her, aren't you?

39:26.359 --> 39:29.359
Not exactly chucking. Yes.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.959
Except I can't tell her.
I've tried, I just can't.

39:32.959 --> 39:35.799
She might... cry or something.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.439
You're her friend,
you know how to handle her.

39:38.439 --> 39:40.078
Can't you do it?

39:40.079 --> 39:43.599
- I could but I won't.
- Please, Liz. I'm desperate.

39:43.599 --> 39:47.799
I'll make it worth your while,
I'll give you anything. Here.

39:47.959 --> 39:51.529
You think I'd do something like that
for chocolate?

39:57.800 --> 40:01.360
Susan, could I come with you?
I don't know where I'm going.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.360
Yeah, fine.

40:09.200 --> 40:12.359
The only trouble with
going for a drink after work

40:12.359 --> 40:15.000
is there's always
a lot of people around.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.270
You don't get a chance to talk properly.
Get to know someone.

40:20.560 --> 40:24.480
Obviously, there'll be other people
around. The barmaid.

40:24.599 --> 40:27.599
- (Laughs)
- What I'm trying to say is...

40:30.560 --> 40:32.999
Will you come out for a drink sometime?

40:32.999 --> 40:35.999
I mean...

40:36.079 --> 40:39.079
just with me.

40:39.799 --> 40:42.879
I don't think that's possible, Susan.
Sorry.

40:43.119 --> 40:46.199
Oh, God. I knew it.
Sorry, I should've realised.

40:46.199 --> 40:48.318
- It's obvious.
- Is it?

40:48.319 --> 40:51.959
Well, it is now I've made
a complete arse of myself.

40:52.999 --> 40:54.959
You're married, aren't you?

40:54.960 --> 40:58.999
Sorry, I thought you were too young.
N-Not too young, not 12...

40:58.999 --> 41:01.118
Susan...

41:01.119 --> 41:04.119
I'm gay.

41:05.559 --> 41:08.559
I thought you knew.

41:09.040 --> 41:13.400
Well, I suspected although I wasn't sure
whether you were completely gay or...

41:13.400 --> 41:16.400
- You didn't have a clue.
- No.

41:17.000 --> 41:20.920
I don't go around advertising it.
Not when I'm this new.

41:22.079 --> 41:25.079
Right.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.470
- Can I just clear something else up?
- What?

41:34.879 --> 41:38.279
I don't draw on my knees.
Just in case you were wondering.

41:38.279 --> 41:41.279
I wasn't, but thanks anyway.

41:45.399 --> 41:48.239
(Jenny) You got Liz to do it?

41:48.240 --> 41:50.879
(Kurt) Women are better at that stuff.

41:50.879 --> 41:53.199
(Jenny) Only because men are pathetic.

41:53.199 --> 41:55.760
(Simon) Never mind, she'll take it OK.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.760
I just hope she doesn't do anything...

41:59.239 --> 42:00.879
..stupid.

42:00.880 --> 42:03.398
(Simon) Like go back out with you?

42:03.399 --> 42:07.389
I'm gonna put that fat little bitch
in the swimming team.

42:07.440 --> 42:11.000
And make her dive to the bottom
of the pool to fetch a brick.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.220
And hold her under
for a very, very long time.

42:15.639 --> 42:18.649
- Liz's daughter.
- Liz has got a daughter?

42:21.680 --> 42:24.680
Well, a few minutes, anyway.

42:29.159 --> 42:32.719
So, do you reckon they're
too heavy to float in water?

42:32.719 --> 42:35.480
- (Simon) Bricks or Kayla?
- Penny's tits.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.999
It was only a matter of time, I suppose.

42:37.999 --> 42:41.440
(Brian) It's like she's got two heads
inside her top.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.719
- I just wish...
- No, don't say it.

42:43.719 --> 42:46.729
- One of them was yours.
- Are you psychic?

42:47.079 --> 42:51.069
Anyway, you poor, deluded fool,
you don't stand a chance.

42:51.519 --> 42:54.359
- She keeps smiling at me.
- She smiled at me.

42:54.359 --> 42:56.478
She looked in my direction.

42:56.479 --> 42:59.360
You're all hopelessly misguided,
as usual.

42:59.360 --> 43:02.119
- She does that to everyone.
- Including you?

43:02.119 --> 43:05.119
(Jenny) Yes, so obviously
she fancies me.

43:07.599 --> 43:10.599
- You reckon?
- Well?

43:11.319 --> 43:12.819
Fiver he said yes.

43:14.639 --> 43:17.159
- All right, you sit here...
- No, it's OK.

43:17.159 --> 43:20.560
- I'm getting the drinks in.
- (Simon) You sit down, I'll go.

43:20.560 --> 43:22.998
Really, I'll get them.

43:22.999 --> 43:25.999
And you can... come with me.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.280
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

43:32.400 --> 43:35.690
- Well, I've changed my mind.
- Just like that?

43:36.399 --> 43:39.720
It's not such a good idea
to go out with a workmate.

43:39.720 --> 43:43.559
- Look at you and Jenny.
- We didn't go out, we just shagged.

43:43.559 --> 43:46.280
Well, whatever.
It would still be awkward.

43:46.280 --> 43:49.290
- Besides, he's a bit young.
- I said that.

43:49.999 --> 43:52.759
Which means you agree with me.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.760
That can't be right.

43:57.280 --> 44:00.280
- He turned you down, didn't he?
- No.

44:01.999 --> 44:05.709
- I... chickened out of asking him.
- (Sighs) Coward.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.960
I know, I'm just crap.

44:09.799 --> 44:12.799
But at least it's all over with now.

44:13.639 --> 44:17.240
Yeah, you don't have to go out with
someone with a poncy name.

44:17.240 --> 44:20.950
What sort of name is JP?
He's obviously got no taste.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.280
And you're too good for him. And...

44:23.280 --> 44:26.560
Stop there. You're saying all this
to make me feel better.

44:26.560 --> 44:29.359
So you'll go back to being normal again?

44:29.359 --> 44:33.699
I think so, yeah. I can go back
to taking the piss out of you.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.078
Cheers.

44:36.079 --> 44:39.280
Shame, I was getting used to being
the sensible one,

44:39.280 --> 44:40.999
with you the hysterical...

44:40.999 --> 44:44.079
- Shut up now or I'll punch you.
- OK, then.

44:45.480 --> 44:47.358
Ow!

44:47.359 --> 44:50.359
Sorry, I felt like it. Anyway.

44:51.520 --> 44:55.300
So, has Penny said anything
to you about liking girls?

44:56.320 --> 44:59.320
- Sorry?
- Ignore him.

44:59.719 --> 45:02.719
(Phone vibrating)

45:03.680 --> 45:07.670
(Jenny) Pick it up,
press the green button and say hello.

45:12.560 --> 45:15.560
(Beep)

45:17.000 --> 45:19.998
Hello?

45:19.999 --> 45:22.999
Liz? Have you told her?

45:30.399 --> 45:33.399
Is she... OK?

45:40.479 --> 45:43.479
(Screaming continues over phone)

45:48.720 --> 45:50.759
She took it well, then.
