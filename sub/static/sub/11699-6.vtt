WEBVTT

00:00.554 --> 00:02.031
(Snoozing)

00:03.633 --> 00:05.177
- And we're back!
- Oh my God.

00:05.738 --> 00:06.955
(Door closes)

00:08.265 --> 00:10.097
I know teething is tough on Emma's gums,

00:10.098 --> 00:11.148
but it's worse on my feet.

00:11.149 --> 00:13.378
I've been walking around the
block since 5 am to calm her down.

00:13.379 --> 00:15.900
If she's not moving,
she's not not screaming.

00:15.901 --> 00:18.783
Dude, bro, trust me, you
do not have to tell the guy

00:18.784 --> 00:21.126
who is using the muffin as his pillow.

00:21.953 --> 00:24.047
It's like living with a velociraptor.

00:24.048 --> 00:25.475
Just... (Screeching)

00:28.006 --> 00:29.295
But all is forgiven.

00:29.296 --> 00:31.838
She found me the one... my perfect girl.

00:31.839 --> 00:33.371
She snagged some girl's
phone off the counter

00:33.372 --> 00:34.610
when we stopped for coffee.

00:34.611 --> 00:37.892
It amazes me what she
shoves into that stroller.

00:37.893 --> 00:40.983
I once found half a
sandwich and a bus pass.

00:41.754 --> 00:44.204
Look, her name's Sydney, and
we were made for each other.

00:44.205 --> 00:45.876
She takes tons of awesome selfies.

00:45.877 --> 00:47.572
I take tons of awesome selfies.

00:48.287 --> 00:49.749
She went to Australia on vacation.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.100
I... generally know where Australia is.

00:52.841 --> 00:53.951
- (Mutters)
- (Exhales)

00:53.952 --> 00:55.385
I'm telling you, man.
She could quite possibly

00:55.386 --> 00:57.837
be my first soul mate.

00:58.658 --> 01:01.293
Ben, that is an invasion of privacy.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.679
Plus, she's got a boatload of hot friends.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.330
- Give me that.
- It's... it's... 

01:05.331 --> 01:06.085
give me... yeah. My turn.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.451
- (Cellphone rings)
- Oh oh! Maybe that's her.

01:10.452 --> 01:11.893
- Here here.
- All right, come here.

01:11.894 --> 01:12.850
There we go.

01:14.111 --> 01:16.143
Hello. Hot girl named Sydney's phone.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.916
Yes yes! I did find it.

01:19.261 --> 01:21.269
No no, I didn't look through it.

01:21.270 --> 01:23.922
Although, you do have a dental
appointment today at two.

01:24.344 --> 01:26.895
(Chuckles) I wouldn't go
ahead and say "lifesaver."

01:26.896 --> 01:29.262
Just your everyday, average, single hero.

01:30.483 --> 01:31.882
Did I say single?

01:33.799 --> 01:35.053
(Babbles)

01:35.054 --> 01:36.401
Yeah yeah, hey.

01:36.402 --> 01:38.546
I get half a sandwich and a bus pass?

01:38.547 --> 01:39.782
He gets a girl?

01:40.101 --> 01:41.756
You owe me, baby. I will bite... 

01:43.994 --> 01:45.391

01:57.351 --> 01:59.054
Okay, so, what do you think?

01:59.055 --> 02:00.518
I have to look perfect.

02:00.519 --> 02:01.834
You look great.

02:01.835 --> 02:03.129
But why do you even care?
I thought you were just

02:03.130 --> 02:04.752
meeting some old friend from summer camp.

02:04.753 --> 02:06.617
No, Danny, not just any friend.

02:06.618 --> 02:08.592
I mean, Heather was my best friend.

02:08.594 --> 02:10.583
Heather? You hated her.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.342
She ruined every one of your summers

02:13.343 --> 02:14.666
from eight to 18,

02:14.667 --> 02:15.900
and then you ruined every one of mine

02:15.901 --> 02:17.485
calling home to complain about her.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.847
All right, yes, we may
have had our differences.

02:20.848 --> 02:22.992
And yes, she may have
beaten me at field hockey

02:22.993 --> 02:25.591
and archery and every other
thing that I ever entered.

02:25.592 --> 02:27.671
And yes, she may have
stolen my boyfriend Jacob,

02:27.672 --> 02:29.150
even though she could
have had any other guy

02:29.151 --> 02:31.046
in the entire camp, you
know, because she's Heather

02:31.047 --> 02:32.495
and she's perfect.

02:33.496 --> 02:34.828
And you know what? Rumor had it,

02:34.829 --> 02:36.265
she'd let you touch 'em.

02:37.254 --> 02:38.858
Under the bra.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.934
Why didn't I go to camp?

02:43.800 --> 02:46.635
My point is, I'm a lawyer now... 

02:47.133 --> 02:52.019
Living on my own in the most
Cosmopolitan city in the world,

02:52.020 --> 02:54.626
so in the game of life I have won!

02:55.955 --> 02:57.716
And it'll be really nice to see her.

02:59.167 --> 03:00.486
Whoo! Yeah!

03:02.244 --> 03:05.814
I just had one of the most amazing
conversations of my entire life.

03:05.815 --> 03:07.164
Which is kinda sad,

03:07.165 --> 03:09.082
because you were just
alone in there with Emma.

03:09.083 --> 03:10.330
(Laughs) No.

03:10.331 --> 03:12.278
Sydney... I found her phone.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.100
And when we finally
meet face-to-face,

03:14.101 --> 03:16.082
hopefully we'll wind up face on face,

03:16.083 --> 03:17.375
if you know what I mean.

03:17.996 --> 03:19.578
Yeah, we always know.

Well, I wouldn't go that far,

03:26.136 --> 03:27.551
but you are kinda moody.

03:29.463 --> 03:31.375
I said bench!

<i>(Door closes)</i>

03:34.067 --> 03:34.903
No.

03:35.218 --> 03:37.052
My first realtor ad

03:37.053 --> 03:40.392
soon to be on bus benches across the city.

03:40.393 --> 03:41.839
Well, one bench.

03:42.667 --> 03:44.256
You have no idea how much it costs

03:44.257 --> 03:45.961
to have people sit on your face.

03:49.592 --> 03:51.989
All right, and ladies and gentlemen... 

03:51.990 --> 03:56.749
This is the new look on
Manhattan real estate!

03:57.345 --> 03:59.481
- Wow, you look so good!
- Oh, my God, is that you... 

03:59.482 --> 04:01.467
- Wow, my God, best photo ever!
- ... Or a supermodel?

04:02.913 --> 04:04.278
What happened?!

04:04.279 --> 04:06.238
Oh, that photographer was an idiot!

04:06.239 --> 04:09.218
I told that stupid moron
he better not screw it up.

04:10.535 --> 04:12.357
And I think we know what happened.

04:13.265 --> 04:15.587
You guys, I look like grandma!

04:17.521 --> 04:19.053
(Screaming)

04:19.807 --> 04:21.277
(Both giggling)

04:21.278 --> 04:23.275
Oh, my gosh, Heather,
it is so good to see you.

04:23.276 --> 04:24.747
You look amazing.

04:24.748 --> 04:26.269
And you haven't changed at all.

04:27.608 --> 04:29.188
Well, I lost 90 pounds,

04:29.189 --> 04:31.352
two feet of hair and a speech impediment.

04:32.579 --> 04:33.666
Well... 

04:33.667 --> 04:35.331
You look exactly the same to me.

04:35.668 --> 04:37.871
So how have you been? Tell me everything!

04:37.872 --> 04:40.665
Uh, well, I'm a lawyer now,

04:40.666 --> 04:43.749
so I've been pretty busy enforcing the law.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.142
That is so crazy.

04:45.143 --> 04:46.514
So am I!

04:46.890 --> 04:49.421
Actually, I just made partner.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.078
Youngest in the firm.

04:51.079 --> 04:52.784
That's why they moved me out here.

04:52.785 --> 04:54.498
- (Both chuckle)
- Partner?

04:54.499 --> 04:56.230
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:56.231 --> 04:58.579
God. Well, who wants to
talk about work, right?

04:58.580 --> 05:00.775
Um, so, I heard through the grapevine

05:00.776 --> 05:02.591
that you're living with your parents again.

05:02.592 --> 05:03.695
(Exhales) Bummer.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.438
I live alone.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.644
You're so lucky.

05:07.957 --> 05:10.876
It's gonna take like two months to
renovate the new condo I just bought.

05:12.383 --> 05:13.824
You bought?

05:13.825 --> 05:15.597
Can you... just... 
can you excuse me for a second?

05:15.598 --> 05:16.744
I'm gonna use the ladies' room.

05:18.468 --> 05:19.640
Take your time.

05:20.049 --> 05:21.475
I'm sure you wanna fix your hair.

05:29.948 --> 05:32.263
Danny, get down here right now.

05:32.264 --> 05:34.101
I'm losing the game of life!

05:35.211 --> 05:37.714
No, I'm not calling you about a board game.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.400
<i>Bonnie:  Okay, Tucker,
I need an expert opinion.</i>

Oh, Mrs. Wheeler, you have
come to the right place.

05:48.897 --> 05:50.478
I work in TV,

05:50.479 --> 05:53.320
and shining up crap is
what I do for a living.

05:55.662 --> 05:57.655
What you need is a slogan.

05:57.656 --> 05:59.628
Something that will grab people's attention

05:59.629 --> 06:02.423
and make them say, "I must
have this Bonnie Wheeler woman".

06:02.424 --> 06:04.702
oh, yeah yeah. How about this?

06:04.703 --> 06:05.572
- Um... 
- Okay.

06:15.965 --> 06:18.142
Here. Emma finally just stopped crying.

06:18.143 --> 06:19.622
This teething thing bites.

06:20.408 --> 06:22.345
That's why God invented rum.

Mom, they don't give
liquor to babies anymore.

She hates me, and she
hasn't even met me yet.

06:44.020 --> 06:47.024
Ben, I heard her screaming
from all the way over here.

06:47.025 --> 06:49.783
Look, if I were you, I would
go find some other Ben Wheeler

06:49.784 --> 06:51.518
to go give her back her phone.

06:52.250 --> 06:53.952
Oh, my God. That's such a good idea.

06:55.145 --> 06:57.076
You can go give her back the phone.

06:57.077 --> 06:58.542
And when she's done screaming at you,

06:58.543 --> 07:01.409
also known as me, I'll
swoop in and be not me.

07:01.410 --> 07:02.633
Tucker, you're a genius.

07:02.634 --> 07:04.124
No no no no no.

Last time I heard
"Tucker, you're a genius,"

07:06.123 --> 07:07.897
I ended up in zoo jail.

07:09.100 --> 07:10.708
But you got to hold the koala.

07:12.097 --> 07:13.700
That's true. (Chuckles)

07:14.488 --> 07:16.448
Ooh! I got it.

07:17.173 --> 07:18.788
"Bonnie Wheeler... 

07:18.789 --> 07:21.778
Keepin' it real... tor."

07:22.563 --> 07:23.706
Yeah?

07:23.707 --> 07:25.528

- Yeah! Huh?

07:26.858 --> 07:28.564
Okay, so, here's what's gonna happen.

07:28.565 --> 07:29.952
You're gonna see me from across the room,

07:29.953 --> 07:33.691
find me just wildly attractive
and come over and hit on me.

07:33.692 --> 07:35.506
Got it. What's my backstory?

07:36.845 --> 07:38.110
You're a hockey player... 

07:38.111 --> 07:40.852
Ohh, that's good. I can play that.

07:41.814 --> 07:44.817
Okay, who really really likes me.

07:44.818 --> 07:46.410
I can play that too.

07:46.411 --> 07:47.416
Okay.

07:48.607 --> 07:50.047
I'm goin' in.

07:50.048 --> 07:53.022
And then I said, "no, you're out of order."

07:53.023 --> 07:54.241
(All laugh)

07:54.242 --> 07:55.863
All right, shoo shoo shoo
shoo, with all of you boys.

07:55.864 --> 07:58.531
Sorry, we're having a
conversation here. Bye bye bye bye.

07:58.532 --> 08:00.413
Oh, God, I am so sorry.

08:00.414 --> 08:03.037
Things are just crazy at the office.

08:03.038 --> 08:05.832
Depositions, contracts, finishing my novel.

08:05.833 --> 08:08.657
Excuse me, I just saw
you from across the room

08:08.658 --> 08:10.525
and find you wildly attractive.

08:10.526 --> 08:12.518
I just had to come and hit on you.

08:14.003 --> 08:16.636
Oh, my gosh. That is so sweet.

08:16.637 --> 08:19.705
(Exhales) I'm a hockey player.

08:20.847 --> 08:22.704
Really? I love hockey.

08:22.705 --> 08:24.152
I used to play in high school.

08:24.153 --> 08:26.359
Seriously? That is so cool.

08:27.503 --> 08:29.245
Okay. No, you didn't, no, she didn't.

08:30.095 --> 08:33.181
Well, I bet I can score on you any day.

08:33.575 --> 08:35.859
Oh-ho, I don't know... 

08:35.860 --> 08:37.376
I'm a professional.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.727
(Chuckles) I wasn't talking about skating.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.041
Neither was I.

08:43.416 --> 08:45.105
Okay. Hey hey. Over here, let's focus.

08:46.039 --> 08:49.075
We probably shouldn't make my friend
over here feel like a third wheel.

08:49.076 --> 08:52.990
So how about you call me later?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.973
Sure. What's your number?

08:56.591 --> 08:58.190
Oh! The card, right.

08:59.166 --> 09:00.596
I should probably go.

09:01.853 --> 09:03.670
(Exhales) Oh, my God.

09:03.671 --> 09:05.059
How cute was he?

09:05.633 --> 09:07.038
Well, thank God you liked him,

09:07.039 --> 09:09.049
'cause I was like, "blech!" You know?

09:11.726 --> 09:13.079
Ooh, there she is.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.473
Okay, just a quick "here you go,"

09:14.474 --> 09:15.469
and then get out of my way.

09:15.470 --> 09:16.737
Okay, cool. But after this,

09:16.738 --> 09:18.221
I'm gonna need you to be me at work,

09:18.222 --> 09:21.205
and return a stapler to
a large woman named Janet.

09:23.682 --> 09:26.319
Sydney? Ben. Here's your phone.

09:26.697 --> 09:27.983
Oh, I'd say "nice to meet you,"

09:27.984 --> 09:31.430
but that ship sailed about
three lattes and two muffins ago.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.710
Well, pardon me for having a life.

09:34.711 --> 09:37.310
Oh, do you? That's so great.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.712
I wonder what that's like.

09:39.429 --> 09:42.087
Hey, girl, I came all
the way uptown for this.

09:42.088 --> 09:44.313
The least you could do is say "thanks."

09:44.314 --> 09:45.789
(Sarcastically) Thanks.

09:46.966 --> 09:48.688
Ooh, I do not like your tone.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.783
- What is... 
- Excuse me, is this guy bothering you?

09:50.784 --> 09:52.432
Oh, he certainly is.

09:52.433 --> 09:53.563
Well, then I'm gonna have to ask you

09:53.564 --> 09:54.759
to leave this woman alone.

09:55.474 --> 09:56.738
Run along now.

10:01.007 --> 10:02.285
(Both chuckle)

10:02.286 --> 10:03.327
Thank you.

10:03.328 --> 10:04.889
That guy was such a jerk.

10:06.263 --> 10:08.396
- I'm Sydney.
- Pleasure to meet you.

10:08.397 --> 10:09.948
I'm... Tucker.

10:10.553 --> 10:11.754
Tucker Dobbs.

10:15.107 --> 10:17.678
Tucker, you, my friend, were perfect.

10:17.679 --> 10:20.076
Thank you. Sydney is amazing.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.975
Yeah yeah, she's something, all right.

10:22.393 --> 10:25.242
Ha! Well, it doesn't really matter
what you think about her, Ben,

10:25.243 --> 10:28.008
because Tucker got her
number and he plans to use it.

10:28.009 --> 10:29.285
<i>(Cellphone rings)</i>

10:31.190 --> 10:32.592
Uh-oh.

10:32.593 --> 10:34.721
Sydney's got Ben's number and is using it.

10:34.722 --> 10:37.357
To video chat. Dude, what does she want?!

10:37.358 --> 10:38.923
Here, you have to be me. Answer it!

10:38.924 --> 10:40.198
Answer it!

10:40.820 --> 10:41.655
(Beeps)

10:43.390 --> 10:45.217
Hello, Sydney.

10:45.218 --> 10:47.152
Ben, I'm so sorry.

10:47.153 --> 10:48.747
I don't know what came over me today,

10:49.154 --> 10:52.051
but the truth is, you're really cute.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.213
And I've been thinking about you all day.

10:54.918 --> 10:56.785
Aw, I've been thinking about you too.

10:57.601 --> 10:58.946
No, you haven't.

10:58.947 --> 11:00.035
Ask about me!

11:00.674 --> 11:02.457
So, what about that other guy?

11:02.458 --> 11:04.757
The Mr. "hey, is this guy bothering you?"

11:04.758 --> 11:06.989
(Chuckles) Tucker, he was nice.

11:07.371 --> 11:10.485
But he's not the guy I talked to on
the phone for two hours this morning.

11:11.163 --> 11:12.342
Yes, he is!

11:12.823 --> 11:14.069
So, I was wondering,

11:14.070 --> 11:16.889
maybe, we could try that again sometime.

11:16.890 --> 11:18.181
Are you asking me out?

11:18.605 --> 11:20.398
No! She's asking me out.

11:20.399 --> 11:22.160
You're just the face of this operation.

11:22.161 --> 11:23.604
Now use it to tell her no.

11:23.605 --> 11:24.810
- Fine.
- Okay.

11:25.284 --> 11:26.633
Sorry about that.

11:26.634 --> 11:27.900
So... 

11:29.094 --> 11:30.661
When did you wanna get together?

11:30.662 --> 11:32.019
Oh, you... 

11:34.307 --> 11:36.195
for the last time, I'm sorry.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.414
What was I supposed to do? Just ignore her?

11:38.415 --> 11:40.000
Yes yes. You could ignore her,

11:40.001 --> 11:41.732
'cause that was the whole
point of the whole thing.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.978
Then I am so canceling our date tonight.

11:44.297 --> 11:45.482
You made a date with her?

11:45.788 --> 11:46.710
No!

11:46.711 --> 11:47.904
We were just gonna go out for a drink... 

11:49.144 --> 11:50.388
And dinner.

11:50.389 --> 11:52.330
Danny... you know what? Go.

11:52.331 --> 11:53.359
I don't even care.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.844
I'm sure Heather would actually implode

11:54.845 --> 11:56.214
if somebody canceled on her.

11:56.972 --> 11:57.859
You know what?

11:58.336 --> 12:00.317
That is actually a really good idea.

12:00.318 --> 12:03.385
Hey hey hey, I don't need some
girl imploding all over me.

12:03.386 --> 12:06.001
No no no, I think it's
time to do unto Heather

12:06.002 --> 12:08.225
as Heather has done unto me.

12:08.226 --> 12:10.197
<i>You are  so keeping that date.</i>

12:10.642 --> 12:11.816
Oh, my God.

12:12.191 --> 12:15.798
(Reading sign) "Looking for a HOT property?
Let's go home together"?

12:15.799 --> 12:17.703
What exactly is your mother selling?

12:18.040 --> 12:19.415
Hey, kids!

12:19.416 --> 12:21.442
So, what do you think of the new bench?

12:21.443 --> 12:23.444
I'm getting loads of calls.

12:23.445 --> 12:27.171
Apparently, there are tons of men
in this city without apartments.

12:27.172 --> 12:28.160
<i>(Cellphone rings)</i>

12:28.161 --> 12:29.602
And there is one now.

12:30.384 --> 12:31.552
Yello?

12:32.314 --> 12:33.892
Yes, this is Bonnie.

12:34.497 --> 12:36.593
Yeah, well, I don't know if
the curtains match the drapes.

12:36.594 --> 12:37.593
It's a new listing.

12:37.594 --> 12:38.792
Mom! Mom! Mom.

12:38.793 --> 12:40.474
I think it might have been
helpful if you'd mention

12:40.475 --> 12:42.193
that you were selling real estate.

12:42.194 --> 12:44.408
What else would I be selling?

12:46.819 --> 12:49.250
Oh, my God. I have to
cancel some appointments.

12:49.251 --> 12:50.606
(Gasps)

12:50.607 --> 12:53.332
How could the company logo get left off?

12:53.333 --> 12:55.709
Tucker said he would
take care of everything.

12:55.710 --> 12:58.480
He came up with the slogan, and he
said that he would proof it for me

12:58.481 --> 12:59.855
and make sure that no... 

12:59.856 --> 13:01.351
Oh, Tucker!

13:02.084 --> 13:02.993
Hi, guys.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.315
Oh, cool, it's up.

13:05.679 --> 13:07.733
Huh. You know, now that I see it,

13:07.734 --> 13:09.719
you kind of look like a prostitute.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.260
You think?!

13:11.261 --> 13:12.992
Oh, my God!

13:14.364 --> 13:16.057
Okay, listen, you filthy old pervert,

13:16.058 --> 13:17.984
never call this number again!

13:18.860 --> 13:21.880
Oh. Sorry, grandma. (Chuckles nervously)

13:23.376 --> 13:25.214
Go like this. Emma, go like this.

13:25.215 --> 13:26.908
Let me see how many you got. Huh?

13:28.461 --> 13:29.377
Oh, my God!

13:29.378 --> 13:30.430
Oh, my God, Ben, you gotta help me.

13:30.431 --> 13:31.269
I'm not talking to you.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.824
I wasn't gonna go out with her!

13:33.523 --> 13:35.229
<i>(Running footsteps approaching)</i>

13:36.859 --> 13:38.216
Where is he?!

13:38.554 --> 13:39.684
Bedroom.

13:39.685 --> 13:41.185
You are dead!

13:41.186 --> 13:42.516
Aah!

13:42.517 --> 13:43.638
Oh, my God.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.578
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

13:45.579 --> 13:47.201
No! No!

No no! Oh, fake-out!

Aah!

13:52.260 --> 13:53.344
Ha ha ha!

13:53.345 --> 13:54.575
Oh, no, you don't!

13:54.576 --> 13:56.420
<i>(Pounding on door)</i>

13:56.421 --> 13:59.020
And why would you wanna go out with
someone who wants to go out with me?

13:59.021 --> 14:00.216
She doesn't wanna go out with you,

14:00.217 --> 14:01.402
she wants to go out with me.

14:01.403 --> 14:02.844
Okay? So this is what's gonna happen.

14:02.845 --> 14:05.463
You're gonna go out with Sydney and you're
gonna be the biggest jerk who ever lived.

14:05.464 --> 14:07.366
But I don't even know how to be a jerk.

14:07.367 --> 14:09.507
Don't worry. I do.

14:11.371 --> 14:14.106
<i>Tucker, open up. I'm not mad anymore.</i>

14:18.325 --> 14:20.517
Alright, Heather should be here any minute.

14:20.518 --> 14:23.557
Oh, God, I can't wait to see the look
on her face when she sees us together.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.918
I kinda feel bad about this.

14:24.919 --> 14:26.506
Oh, yeah yeah, whatever.
Take your shirt off.

14:26.951 --> 14:29.412
- Are you sure?
- Oh, my God, come on. Work with me here, Wheeler.

14:29.413 --> 14:30.835
We have to make this look really good.

14:33.283 --> 14:35.025
Now, uh, get down on the couch.

14:36.145 --> 14:37.668
Let's do this.

14:37.669 --> 14:38.988
Uh... 

14:38.989 --> 14:40.512
How long are you gonna be on top of me?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.251
Oh, God, sorry. Am I too heavy?

14:42.252 --> 14:44.353
That is so not the problem.

14:49.682 --> 14:52.370
Danny? Riley?

14:52.371 --> 14:53.644
What is going on?

14:53.645 --> 14:54.678
Oh, no, Heather,

14:54.679 --> 14:56.844
this is so not what it looks like.

14:57.846 --> 15:00.846
Actually, it's exactly what it looks like.

15:01.953 --> 15:03.534
Oops.

15:04.366 --> 15:05.941
What is wrong with you?!

15:05.942 --> 15:07.473
I can't believe you would do this to me!

15:10.196 --> 15:11.673
Yes!

15:13.002 --> 15:17.719
That was awesome! I won! I finally won!

15:17.720 --> 15:20.651
Oh, my God, it's like she couldn't
even comprehend what was happening.

15:20.652 --> 15:23.171
And did you see the look on her face?

15:23.172 --> 15:26.402
That was the face of defeat.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.047
That was my face. She was me!

15:29.867 --> 15:31.040
Which means... 

15:31.439 --> 15:32.944
That I was her.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.065
Oh, my God.

15:37.657 --> 15:40.386
Oh. Ew. God, I'm a horrible person.

15:40.387 --> 15:41.801
Oh, why didn't you say something?

15:43.229 --> 15:45.037
We have to go after her. Are you coming?

15:45.038 --> 15:48.309
Um, no, you go on ahead. I'm just
gonna stay here for a minute or two.

15:49.474 --> 15:51.001
No reason.

15:52.927 --> 15:55.430
Ben, this just is not going to work.

15:55.431 --> 15:58.345
I mean, let's face it. I
am just too darn lovable.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.773
Don't worry. I'll walk you through it.

16:01.774 --> 16:03.185
Just do everything I say.

16:03.186 --> 16:04.452
Oh, here she comes. Here she comes.

16:04.453 --> 16:06.191
- Here you go.
- (Chuckles)

16:06.192 --> 16:07.294
Oh! I know exactly what to say.

16:07.781 --> 16:08.992

16:10.142 --> 16:11.706
I hope you brought a lot of cash,

16:11.707 --> 16:14.369
because I'm planning on getting trashed!

16:14.370 --> 16:15.578
(Both laughing)

16:15.579 --> 16:17.353
And I hope you're ready for trouble,

'cause I'm ready to see double!

16:19.674 --> 16:21.025
Ho ho!

Oh, my God. She really
is the perfect woman.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.365
Oh, there she is.

16:28.366 --> 16:30.392
Let me just talk to her alone for a second.

16:33.836 --> 16:35.313
Hey, you workin' or lurkin'?

16:35.655 --> 16:36.984
Lurkin'. Tucker's being me,

16:36.985 --> 16:38.154
and I'm being him.

16:38.155 --> 16:39.660
Fun! Who am I?

16:40.706 --> 16:42.725
You're just you, okay?

16:44.781 --> 16:46.280
I'm trying to break up
with a girl who's impervious

16:46.281 --> 16:47.786
to even my jerkiest moves.

16:48.088 --> 16:51.522
Both: ♪ and the home of the... ♪

16:52.113 --> 16:54.010
(Both belch loudly)

16:54.011 --> 16:55.501
(Laughs)

17:02.005 --> 17:03.159
(Sighs)

17:03.160 --> 17:04.215
Heather.

17:04.762 --> 17:07.212
I owe you a huge apology,

17:07.213 --> 17:08.734
because what you saw back there,

17:08.736 --> 17:10.009
it wasn't even real.

17:10.612 --> 17:11.881
The guy is a friend of mine.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.084
I don't understand.

17:14.085 --> 17:15.454
I guess I just wanted to feel like

17:15.455 --> 17:17.587
I'd finally won at something.

17:17.588 --> 17:21.470
And I wanted to hurt you the way
that you hurt me when you stole Jacob.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.258
Who's Jacob?

17:24.740 --> 17:26.195
Jacob. (Scoffs)

17:26.196 --> 17:28.348
My boyfriend at summer camp.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.439
My first kiss. My second base.

17:31.325 --> 17:33.192
You never had a boyfriend at summer camp.

17:33.193 --> 17:36.800
Uh, yeah, I did until you swooped
in with your quick-release bra.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.568
Okay, let me start over.

17:42.106 --> 17:44.109
Now just tell her you're
looking to scam with someone,

17:44.110 --> 17:45.586
not actually date right now.

17:45.587 --> 17:46.897
Oh oh, I know, I know.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.572
Tell her her hair smells nice.

17:50.225 --> 17:51.791
You are so bad at this.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.107
This why I had to learn
everything I know off the streets.

17:54.108 --> 17:55.704
Hey! I know how to get girls.

17:55.705 --> 17:56.936
I'm meeting up with one right now.

17:56.937 --> 17:58.072
And I have to say,

17:58.073 --> 17:59.267
she's pretty hot.

17:59.850 --> 18:01.878
And in the end, I just realized

18:01.879 --> 18:04.222
what a horrible person I was becoming.

18:04.223 --> 18:06.230
And by horrible, you mean just like me?

18:06.231 --> 18:07.829
Oh, my God. So you do understand?

18:09.644 --> 18:10.963
Friends again?

18:10.964 --> 18:13.948
So, are you ready to kiss and make up?

18:13.949 --> 18:15.296
I know I am.

18:16.847 --> 18:19.095
Oh, good, I was hoping
you two would be here.

18:19.419 --> 18:20.358
I did it.

18:20.359 --> 18:23.278
I made it clear what I was selling.

18:23.279 --> 18:26.279
And now I can go back to just
giving the other part away.

18:27.312 --> 18:29.116
Hey, hooker heels, hold this.

18:29.728 --> 18:32.295
And... (Imitates drum roll)

18:33.817 --> 18:35.166
Ha!

18:35.167 --> 18:36.266
Wheeler?

18:36.751 --> 18:39.297
You aren't related to
a Ben Wheeler, are you?

18:39.298 --> 18:40.882
Oh, yeah. He's my brother.

18:40.883 --> 18:42.648
Weren't you like totally
in love with that guy?

18:42.649 --> 18:44.984
Seriously, it was like
all you ever talked about.

18:44.985 --> 18:46.921
- No no, it wasn't.
- Yeah.

18:47.355 --> 18:49.540
Yeah, I'm pretty sure Ben
Wheeler was the name of the pillow

18:49.541 --> 18:50.840
you were always making out with.

18:52.826 --> 18:54.399
Are you guys looking for a Ben Wheeler?

18:54.400 --> 18:56.050
'Cause I'm having drinks
with him over there.

18:57.109 --> 18:58.460
Oh.

18:58.461 --> 19:00.372
Oh, no, that's not Ben. That's Tucker.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.375
- No, it's not.
- Oh, no.

19:02.376 --> 19:04.972
That's Tucker, all right.
That son of a bench.

19:06.832 --> 19:08.544
A word, tuck tuck?

19:08.545 --> 19:09.508
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

19:09.509 --> 19:10.993
No! Really?

19:10.994 --> 19:12.090
- Yeah!
- No.

19:12.393 --> 19:13.914
No! Oh!

19:13.915 --> 19:16.025
Oh, God!

19:16.026 --> 19:17.117
It was lovely to meet you.

19:18.894 --> 19:19.868
Ben!

19:19.869 --> 19:21.819
No no no no no. Actually, I'm Ben.

19:23.158 --> 19:24.749
What the hell is going on?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.158
It's kind of a long story.

19:26.509 --> 19:28.247
- Try me.
- Okay.

19:28.248 --> 19:31.031
Well, I liked you and you liked me,

19:31.032 --> 19:33.264
but then you got mad, so
I sent him in to be me,

19:33.265 --> 19:34.458
but then you liked him.

19:34.459 --> 19:36.079
But he was just pretending to be me.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.830
So I sent him in to be me
to make you not like him,

19:37.831 --> 19:39.090
but it turned out you liked him,

19:39.091 --> 19:41.642
which means you like me.

19:43.102 --> 19:45.212
It's actually kinda simple
when you think about it.

19:46.350 --> 19:49.815
Well, unfortunately, I, who's also me,

19:49.816 --> 19:51.823
doesn't really like
either one of you anymore.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.161
In fact, you, meaning you... 

19:55.162 --> 19:56.836
Are kind of a jerk.

20:03.139 --> 20:04.773
Hey, what are you doing here?

20:04.774 --> 20:06.352
I don't wanna get in the way of anything.

20:06.353 --> 20:08.368
You know, if you have any overnight guests.

20:08.369 --> 20:10.145
- Riley, it's not... 
- Just let me finish.

20:11.202 --> 20:13.620
I never should have put
you in that position.

20:13.621 --> 20:16.800
And if you like Heather,
then I am totally fine

20:16.801 --> 20:18.159
with the two of you going out.

20:18.160 --> 20:19.472
We're not going out.

20:19.473 --> 20:21.036
She kinda disappeared right after you left.

20:21.037 --> 20:22.535
Oh, thank God. 'Cause
that last thing I said

20:22.536 --> 20:23.977
<i>- I really didn't mean it.
- (Door opens)</i>

20:26.586 --> 20:27.577
Oh.

20:27.578 --> 20:28.814
Oh, morning, Riley.

20:29.646 --> 20:30.976
Danny, I thought you just said that... 

20:30.977 --> 20:32.813
don't look at me. She's not mine.

20:34.247 --> 20:35.649
- Good morning. Hi.
- Good morning.

20:39.176 --> 20:41.073
Hey, have you guys met Heather yet?

20:43.818 --> 20:45.199
Well played.

20:51.715 --> 20:53.127
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

20:53.821 --> 20:55.287
Hold it up, grandpa. Move along, all right?

20:55.288 --> 20:56.916
I'm selling dreams here. Okay? Yeah.

20:56.917 --> 20:58.578
Shuffle along. Go go go go go go.

20:59.284 --> 21:02.088
Bonnie Wheeler, family realtor.

21:03.132 --> 21:05.175
Bonnie Wheeler, just a single mom

21:05.176 --> 21:06.668
trying to make a living.

21:07.444 --> 21:10.035
Bonnie Wheeler, hot property.

21:10.036 --> 21:12.196
You know, just babysitting. She's not mine.

21:12.197 --> 21:13.790
Oh, yeah. I got all day.

21:14.194 --> 21:15.903
I got nowhere to be. Walk slow.
