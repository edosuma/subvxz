[applause]

00:15.180 --> 00:17.307
[camera shutters snapping]

00:17.410 --> 00:19.219
- QUALITY OF LIFE IS UP

00:19.320 --> 00:22.016
BECAUSE CRIME IN SANTA BARBARA
IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW

00:22.120 --> 00:23.519
DUE TO THE TIRELESS EFFORTS

00:23.620 --> 00:25.144
OF YOUR SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

00:25.250 --> 00:29.016
- CORRECTION: SERIOUSLY
UNDERFUNDED POLICE DEPARTMENT,

00:29.130 --> 00:31.086
YOU ECO-SOCIALIST MOONBAT.

00:31.190 --> 00:32.225

00:32.330 --> 00:34.059
AND PEOPLE LIKE TREES,
CARLTON.

- I AM HONORED
TO RECOGNIZE CHIEF KAREN VICK,

HER DEDICATED OFFICERS,

00:38.730 --> 00:40.391

IT'S ALL TOO MUCH.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.109
THANK YOU, MAYOR.

00:54.220 --> 00:55.573
WHAT IS GENIUS?

00:55.680 --> 00:57.147
CAN YOU BO'I'I'LE IT?

00:57.250 --> 01:01.118
IS IT SOMETHING YOU WOULD
EVEN WANT TO BOTTLE?

01:03.160 --> 01:03.819
[scoffs]
CHIEF, I'M SO SORRY.

01:03.930 --> 01:05.750
I'M SUCH A JERK SOMETIMES.

01:05.790 --> 01:06.154
LOOK AT THIS, EVERYONE.
ISN'T THAT NICE?

01:09.470 --> 01:10.619
_ OH--

01:10.730 --> 01:13.790
- IT IS MOMENTS LIKE THIS

01:13.900 --> 01:15.629
THAT MAKE MY SECOND SIGHT

01:15.740 --> 01:17.298
AND ILLUSTRIOUS GIFI' SET

01:17.410 --> 01:18.707
SO WORTHWHILE.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.074
I BELIEVE
IT WAS EMF

01:21.180 --> 01:25.446
WHO FIRST SAID,
"YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE."

01:25.550 --> 01:26.710
IF ONLY I HAD KNOWN THEN

01:26.820 --> 01:30.210
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT ME.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.709
[laughs]

01:32.820 --> 01:34.788
[applause]

01:37.860 --> 01:40.852
- THAT'S WHY
WE NEED YOUR HELP...

01:40.960 --> 01:43.861
WOULD YOU BOTH EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

01:45.470 --> 01:47.358
YOU HAVE A GIFT,
MY FRIEND.

01:47.470 --> 01:49.768
- OH, GAVIN, WE MUST FIND TIME
TO SPEAK ABOUT MY PROPOSAL.

01:49.810 --> 01:50.162
- SHAWN, WE LEGALLY
CAN'T REMOVE

01:51.810 --> 01:53.437
THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS
AND SPEED LIMIT SIGNS.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.571
BETWEEN YOUR HOUSE
AND THE PSYCH OFFICE.

01:56.680 --> 01:57.874
- THAT IS CORRECT,
AND THERE WILL BE A SPEED LIMIT.

01:57.980 --> 01:59.618
140 MILES PER HOUR.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.211
WE WILL CALL IT
THE SUPER SPEED CORRIDOR.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.787
THE AUTOBAHN OF SANTA BARBARA.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.711
IT IS BOTH INEXPENSIVE
AND SIMPLE.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.288
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
INEXPENSIVE OR SIMPLE.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.459
- PLUS IT GOES
THROUGH THREE SCHOOLS.

02:10.560 --> 02:11.549
- WHY DO YOU HATE PROGRESS?

02:11.660 --> 02:13.821
- GUYS, MY WIFE RENEE.

02:13.930 --> 02:15.397
- HELLO.
- OH.

02:15.500 --> 02:19.334
- ARE THESE PEOPLE IMPORTANT?
- RENEE.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.896
- BUH-BYE.
- OH.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.831
SO BRIEF.

02:22.940 --> 02:25.738
- MR. MAYOR, THE SACRAMENTO
CONTINGENT IS HERE.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.376
- AH, WONDERFUL.
HAVE YOU GUYS MET?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.448
- JASON STRAUB,
GO-TO STAFFER.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.302
YOU GAVE HIM CREDIT
FOR GETTING YOU REELECTED

02:31.410 --> 02:33.219
AFI'ER THAT WATER DISTRICT FLAP
LAST YEAR.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.844
- WOW, YOU REALLY KNOW
YOUR LOCAL POLITICS.

02:34.950 --> 02:36.815
- WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT.
HE'S A REAL STAR-IN-THE-MAKING.

02:36.920 --> 02:38.547
DAMN HANDY WHEN FIRES
NEED PUTTING OUT.

02:38.650 --> 02:40.288
_ THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR,
BUT WE REALLY NEED

02:40.390 --> 02:41.618
TO THINK ABOUT MAKING
OUR EXIT.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.358
- IN A MINUTE, J.
LISTEN, SHAWN,

02:43.460 --> 02:45.325
YOU ALWAYS BRIGHTEN MY DAY
WHENEVER YOU COME DOWN HERE,

02:45.430 --> 02:47.455
AND I WANTED TO OFFER UP
A LITTLE TOKEN.

02:47.560 --> 02:49.221
- YOU'RE GOING TO APPROVE
MY CHUNNEL TO CATALINA.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.922
- I WAS THINKING MORE ALONG
THE LINES OF BRUNCH AT MY PLACE.

02:51.030 --> 02:52.463
AFTER MY SURF TOMORROW?

02:52.570 --> 02:53.832
MAYBE AROUND 10:00?

02:53.940 --> 02:55.635
WE'D LOVE TO SEE JULIET.

02:55.740 --> 02:56.832
WE'VE REALLY MISSED HER
SINCE SHE WORKED FOR US

02:56.940 --> 02:58.339
AT CITY HALL.
- I'M SURE.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.930
THE THING WITH JULIET IS--

03:00.040 --> 03:01.701
- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYTHING
BUT YOU'RE ENGAGED.

03:01.810 --> 03:02.902
- [laughs]

03:03.010 --> 03:04.375
- I'LL CHECK HER AVAILABILITY,
MAYOR.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.777
I'M SURE SHE MISSES YOU.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.542
- GREAT.

03:08.650 --> 03:09.787
- I'M AVAILABLE FOR BRUNCH.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.744
- YOU'RE AVAILABLE
TO SUCK IT.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.511
MAN, I GOTTA GO FIND JULES.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.917
- YEAH.
- SHAWN, NO.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.385
- MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME.

03:16.490 --> 03:18.185
I SAID
THERE WOULD BE BLINTZES.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.518
- SHAWN,
I'M NOT GOING TO BRUNCH

03:19.630 --> 03:20.528
AT THE MAYOR'S HOUSE
WITH YOU.

03:20.630 --> 03:21.949
WE'RE BROKEN UP.

03:22.060 --> 03:22.822
- I THOUGHT WE TOOK
A SMALL STEP FORWARD.

03:23.530 --> 03:24.599
- WELL, I THOUGHT WE DID TOO.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.861
AND THEN I SEE YOU UP THERE,

03:26.970 --> 03:29.302
JUST GLOATING
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.832
AND IT'S A SOLID REMINDER
OF ALL THE ISSUES

03:30.940 --> 03:32.578
I HAVE WITH YOU.

03:32.680 --> 03:33.829
IT'S JUST A CHARADE.

03:33.940 --> 03:35.237
- OH, COME ON, JULES.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.876
I WAS--
I WAS JUST PLAYING AROUND.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.447
YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE'RE GONNA BREAK

03:38.550 --> 03:39.812
HIS LITTLE MAYOR HEART.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.979
- HE'S A GROWN MAN.

03:42.080 --> 03:43.684
I THINK HE'LL LAND
ON HIS FEET.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.821
[imitates explosion sound]

03:49.930 --> 03:52.922
- [over radio] SURF CONDITIONS
ARE FINALLY PICKING UP

03:53.030 --> 03:54.554
TO THREE-TO-FOUR FEET
AFTER NOTHING

03:54.660 --> 03:56.719
BUT ON E-TO-TWO-FOOTERS
IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.695
- WHY WERE WE LISTENING
TO THE SURF REPORT?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.337
- 'CAUSE I WANT TO BONE UP
ON THE LINGO, IMPRESS CHANNING.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.862
- BONING UP IS NOT A THING,
SHAWN.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.267
- YEAH, MAYBE NOT IN JAMAICA.

04:04.370 --> 04:05.928
- DUDE, STOP CRUSHING
ON THE MAYOR.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.371
- I'M NOT CRUSHING ON HIM.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.936
I LIKE HIM.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.268
I LIKE HIS HOUSE,
HIS CAR,

04:10.380 --> 04:11.802
HIS HAIR.

04:11.850 --> 04:12.009
I MEAN, THE MAN
HAS HIS OWN PRIVATE BEACH

04:13.450 --> 04:14.371
WITH ACCESS TO THE BEST WAVES

04:14.480 --> 04:15.469
IN SANTA BARBARA, GUS.

04:15.580 --> 04:16.786
PLUS, HE SMELLS
LIKE CHRISTMAS.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.289
AND, IF HE AND I
BECOME SURFING BUDDIES,

04:18.390 --> 04:20.449
SO BE IT.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.983
[indistinct radio chatter]

04:23.090 --> 04:24.626
WHOA!
WHOA, HOLD UP, HOLD UP.

04:24.730 --> 04:27.927
WHAT--
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

04:29.730 --> 04:32.938
- LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT NEED
TO GET A NEW SURFING BUDDY.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.837
- REALLY?

04:34.940 --> 04:38.933
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

04:39.040 --> 04:42.874
*

04:42.980 --> 04:44.004
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES

04:44.110 --> 04:45.998
* THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY

04:46.110 --> 04:48.317
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN *

04:49.620 --> 04:51.383

04:51.490 --> 04:53.981
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

04:54.090 --> 04:57.856

TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

04:57.960 --> 05:01.828
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

05:01.860 --> 05:02.019
*

05:03.530 --> 05:05.896
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:06.000 --> 05:07.592

THE TRUTH *

05:07.700 --> 05:09.702
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:09.810 --> 05:11.562
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE

* I KNOW YOU KNOW

05:23.720 --> 05:25.312
- IT'S IRONIC,
IF YOU ASK ME.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.853
HE FOUGHT SO HARD
TO SAVE THE OCEAN,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.313
AND THEN GETS KILLED BY IT.

05:28.420 --> 05:29.785
- CARLTON, PLEASE.

05:29.890 --> 05:31.323
PEOPLE ARE IN A STATE
OF SHOCK OVER THIS.

05:31.430 --> 05:33.921
- HE WAS SURFING IN A SPOT
CALLED "THE VORTEX."

05:34.030 --> 05:35.497
PRETTY ROUGH.
I SHOULD KNOW.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.329
THAT SECTION HAS ALMOST
TAKEN ME OUT A COUPLE TIMES.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.795
- YOU SURF?
- NO.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.458
BUT I DO A FAIR AMOUNT
OF NUDE SUNBATHING.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.435
OCCASIONALLY, I HAVE TO GO IN,
DO A LITTLE RINSE-OFF.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.804
- THE VORTEX HAS ROCKS
JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE.

05:44.910 --> 05:45.729
- YES.

05:45.770 --> 05:46.031
NOTICE THE JAGGED PATTERN HERE.
BRUTAL.

05:47.880 --> 05:48.039
I'M ESTIMATING HE WAS
IN THE WATER

05:49.880 --> 05:50.039
ABOUT FOUR HOURS
BEFORE HE WAS FOUND.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.542
- OKAY, THEN CASE CLOSED.

05:52.650 --> 05:54.743
KILLED BY TOO MUCH NATURE.
COME ON.

05:54.850 --> 05:56.841
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
FOUR HOURS?

05:58.850 --> 06:01.819
- NOTHING BUT ONE-TO-TWO-FOOTERS
IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.

06:01.860 --> 06:02.019
- THAT WOULD HAVE PUT HIM
IN THE WATER

06:03.590 --> 06:04.852
AT WHAT, LIKE, 6:00 A.M.?
- MM-HMM.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.757
- THERE WERE NO WAVES
AT 6:00 AM.

06:06.860 --> 06:09.567
GUS, PULL UP
THE SURF REPORT.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.888
- HE'S RIGHT.
THERE WERE NO WAVES.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.833
- WHY WOULD THE MAYOR GO SURFING
WHEN THERE WAS NO SURF?

06:14.870 --> 06:15.029
THAT DOESN'T STRIKE ANYONE
AS THE SLIGHTEST BIT SUSPICIOUS?

06:17.670 --> 06:19.001
- WELL, LOOK.
EVERYONE LIKED HIM, SHAWN--

06:19.110 --> 06:20.372
- HMM.
- BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK

06:20.480 --> 06:21.606
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR US TO GO ON?

06:21.710 --> 06:23.007
- SURE.
- ABSOLUTELY.

06:23.110 --> 06:24.907
TELL YOU WHAT.

06:25.010 --> 06:25.840
LET'S DRAG KING NEPTUNE
INTO INTERROGATION ROOM "B"

06:25.880 --> 06:26.039
AND PUT THE SCREWS TO HIM.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.787
- ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE PLAN.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.915
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO CHANNING'S
RIGHT-HAND MAN, STRAUB,

06:35.020 --> 06:36.988
SEE IF HE HAS ANY IDEA
WHO MIGHT HAVE HAD IT OUT

06:37.090 --> 06:38.523
FOR HIS OLD BOSS.

06:38.630 --> 06:39.824
HEY. YOU WITH ME?

06:39.930 --> 06:41.420
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T BELIEVE

06:41.530 --> 06:42.827
WE'RE IN SANTA BARBARA'S
CORRIDORS OF POWER.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.591
- NOT THIS THING--
- YOU KNOW, SHAWN,

06:44.700 --> 06:45.997
I COULD'VE MADE IT IN ALL
THE WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.658
- YEAH. MAYBE AS AN AIDE.
- OF COURSE.

06:47.770 --> 06:49.658
- SAY, "YES, MR. PRESIDENT."
- YES, MR. PRESIDENT.

06:49.770 --> 06:52.000
- SORRY, CHARLIE.
- MAN, YOU DON'T KNOW.

06:52.110 --> 06:53.737
I'M JUST SAYING,
I COULD'VE BEEN

06:53.840 --> 06:55.171
THE BLACK JAMES CARVILLE.
- WHO'S THAT?

06:55.280 --> 06:56.679
THE FARMER FROM BABE?

06:56.780 --> 06:57.906
- THAT'S JAMES CROMWELL,
SHAWN.

06:58.010 --> 07:00.979
- THAT'LL DO, GUS.
THAT'LL DO.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.945
- WILL YOU PUT THAT DOWN?

07:03.050 --> 07:04.039
LET'S JUST WAIT FOR STRAUB
TO GET HERE AND--

07:04.150 --> 07:06.687
[door opening]
- PRE'I'I'Y GORGEOUS, HUH?

07:06.790 --> 07:07.916
- AH, HEY, MAN.
YEAH.

07:08.020 --> 07:09.658
I ALMOST SNAGGED MYSELF
ONE OF THESE

07:09.760 --> 07:11.978
IN THE CLAW CRANE GAME
AT DAVE & BUSTER'S,

07:12.090 --> 07:13.796
BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW
THAT THING IS RIGGED.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.118
- THOSE ARE MEXICAN TURQUOISE.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.925
MAYOR CHANNING
USED TO BRING IT BACK

07:18.030 --> 07:19.634
FROM HIS REMOTE SURF SPOTS
IN MEXICO

07:19.740 --> 07:21.469
AND GIVE THEM TO PEOPLE
AS GIFTS.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.902
HE WAS GENEROUS THAT WAY.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.136
HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.834
- HOW ABOUT ENEMIES?

07:27.940 --> 07:29.999
- NO, NOT REALLY.

07:30.110 --> 07:32.146
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT MADE HIM
SUCH AN EFFECTIVE POLITICIAN.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.808
EVERYBODY LOVED HIM.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.069
WE WERE JUST IN THE PROCESS

07:35.180 --> 07:37.216
OF RAISING $50,000
TO GET US TO SACRAMENTO.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.787
- THAT'S EXCESSIVE.

07:38.890 --> 07:39.857
SACRAMENTO'S
ONLY 200 MILES AWAY.

07:39.960 --> 07:40.688
- HE WANTED TO BE GOVERNOR?

07:40.790 --> 07:42.849
- WHAT, BY OVERSPENDING
ON TRAVEL?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.588
- NO, WE NEEDED THE 50 GRAND
FOR AN EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE.

07:45.690 --> 07:46.588
- WHY DID HE NEED
TO RAISE THE MONEY?

07:46.700 --> 07:47.997
WASN'T CHANNING LOADED?

07:48.100 --> 07:49.761
- NO, HIS WIFE
IS THE WEALTHY ONE,

07:49.870 --> 07:51.861
AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE TO PART
WITH HER MONEY.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.494
- OH.
- SPEAKING OF PARTING,

07:53.600 --> 07:55.659
I GOTTA GET THIS PLACE
PACKED UP FOR THE NEW STAFF.

07:55.770 --> 07:57.965
- WOW, THAT QUICKLY?
- YEAH.

07:58.070 --> 08:00.630
SANTA BARBARA LAW STATES
THAT THE HEAD OF CITY COUNCIL

08:00.740 --> 08:03.709
TAKES OVER IN THE EVENT
OF THE MAYOR'S DEATH.

08:03.810 --> 08:05.038
THAT MEANS THE NEW STAFF
WILL BE IN

08:05.150 --> 08:06.674
BY THE END OF THE WEEK,

08:06.780 --> 08:09.044
AND I GET TO HELP
DURING THE TRANSITION.

08:09.150 --> 08:10.048
SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

08:10.150 --> 08:11.708
- MY APOLOGIES, GENTLEMEN.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.913
WAS I INTERRUPNFAHG SOMETHING?

08:14.020 --> 08:16.523
- TOM, THIS IS SHAWN SPENCER
AND BURTON GUSTER.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.928
GUYS, THIS IS THE CITY'S
NEW MAYOR, TOM SWAGERTY.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.657
- GENTLEMEN, A PLEASURE.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.523
LISTEN, JASON, I KNOW
THIS IS TOUGH ON ALL OF US,

08:22.630 --> 08:24.120
AND I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE

08:24.230 --> 08:26.061
THAT YOU'RE HERE
HELPING THE WAY YOU ARE.

08:26.170 --> 08:27.569
NATURALLY, I DON'T THINK
IT'S APPROPRIATE

08:27.670 --> 08:29.137
TO DISCUSS BUSINESS
AT THIS TIME,

08:29.240 --> 08:30.662
SO I JUST CAME BY HERE
TO GIVE YOU THESE--

08:30.770 --> 08:31.964
A FEW KEY OBJECTIVES
I'D LIKE

08:32.070 --> 08:33.970
TO GET ROLLING ON
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS

08:34.080 --> 08:36.173
AND AN AGENDA FOR TOMORROW
NIGHT'S COUNCIL MEETING.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.747
THE FIRST IS A PROPOSAL
FOR A NEW CITY MOTTO.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.839
- OOH.

08:38.880 --> 08:39.039
MIGHT I SUGGEST
"SANTA BARBARA...

08:40.920 --> 08:43.980
"STOP FOR A PEE,
BUT STAY FOR A LIFETIME"?

08:44.090 --> 08:45.978
OR HOW ABOUT THIS?

08:46.090 --> 08:47.580
"SANTA BARBARA:

08:47.690 --> 08:49.920
THIS IS WHERE
ROB LOWE HUMPS IT OUT."

08:50.030 --> 08:51.884
- HMM.
YOU CAN SUGGEST THAT.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.526
GOOD DAY.

08:55.260 --> 08:57.524
- THERE'S A VOTE
TO CONVERT THE WETLANDS

08:57.630 --> 08:59.166
INTO AN OUTDOOR MALL?
- YEAH.

08:59.270 --> 09:01.659
I MEAN, CHANNING'S BEEN NIXING
THE IDEA FOR YEARS,

09:01.770 --> 09:03.738
BUT THE DEVELOPER,
PACIFIC ACQUISITIONS,

09:03.840 --> 09:05.899
USES THEIR INFLUENCE
TO KEEP IT ALIVE.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.875
- HMM.

09:09.710 --> 09:10.938
- [over TV]
AT EDGEMONT LANDING,

09:11.050 --> 09:13.018
EXPERIENCE PREMIER COMFORT
AND DESIGN...

09:13.120 --> 09:14.109
[sighs]
OOH.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.312
GUS, IF WE ARE EVER
AN INCH TALL,

09:15.420 --> 09:16.819
WE'RE LIVING THERE.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.012
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.815
- HELLO, MA'AM.
- HELLO.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.114
- MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.721
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
BILL UVRIGHTS.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.819
- [imitates gunshot]

09:23.930 --> 09:24.988
- WHAT WAS THAT?

09:25.090 --> 09:26.125
- THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

09:26.230 --> 09:27.891
- YOU JUST SHOT HER
IN THE FACE.

09:28.000 --> 09:28.955
- I WASN'T AIMING AT HER,
SHAWN.

09:29.060 --> 09:29.958
I WAS SHADOW-HUNTING.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.719
- WE'RE HERE
TO SEE THE BOSS.

09:31.830 --> 09:32.990
- WHICH BOSS?

09:33.100 --> 09:34.795
THERE ARE A LOT OF THOSE
AROUND HERE.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.037
- THE BIG CHEESE.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.598
THE POOB GRANDIER.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.234
- I DON'T SEE YOUR NAMES
ON THE SCHEDULE.

09:41.340 --> 09:42.648
WHAT IS THIS REGARDING?

09:42.750 --> 09:43.944
- WELL, WE ARE HERE
TO PRESENT

09:44.050 --> 09:46.143
A NEW VERSION
OF THE WETLAND PROJECT.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.981
PLEASE OBSERVE.
- WAHHH...

09:51.950 --> 09:53.850
- THERE'S A CUPCAKE.
- YES.

09:53.960 --> 09:56.110
- THAT REPRESENTS A
5,000-SQUARE-FOOT CUPCAKE STORE

09:56.220 --> 09:58.085
CALLED
COMPLIMENTARY CUPCAKES.

09:58.190 --> 09:59.794
- THAT MEANS
ALL THE CUPCAKES ARE FREE.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.118
- WHAT'S THAT APPLE CORE
SUPPOSED TO BE?

10:02.230 --> 10:05.063
- OOH, WELL, THAT IS
JUST AN APPLE CORE.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.660
THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE, BILL.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.738
- BOOM.
NOW IT'S A REC CENTER.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.899
- [chuckles]
HOW DO YOU LIKE THEM APPLES?

10:11.010 --> 10:12.807
[laughter]
- ARE YOU DONE?

10:12.910 --> 10:14.878
- MA'AM, WE WILL NOT
BE IGNORED.

10:14.910 --> 10:15.069
- SHE'S CALLING THE BOSS.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.847
- I'M CALLING SECURITY.
- WHAT?

10:18.950 --> 10:21.043
- I TOLD YOU THIS
WAS A STUPID IDEA.

10:21.150 --> 10:25.018
- PICK UP, PICK UP.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.314
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:26.420 --> 10:30.925
- SHAWN, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

10:31.030 --> 10:34.659
- WOULD YOU HOLD ON?
- FOR WHAT?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.993
- EH.
- HURRY UP!

10:47.480 --> 10:50.779
- DUDE.
LET'S GO.

10:55.950 --> 10:58.919
- YOU'RE SAYING THAT
TOM SWAGERTY KILLED THE MAYOR?

10:59.020 --> 11:00.817
- SHH.
NO, NOT ME, CHIEF.

11:00.920 --> 11:01.955
THE SPIRITS ARE SAYING IT.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.288
- WELL, IF THE SPIRITS
HAVE ANY PROOF,

11:03.390 --> 11:04.357
WE'D CERTAINLY LIKE
TO HEAR IT.

11:04.460 --> 11:05.722
- CHIEF,

11:05.830 --> 11:06.990
SWAGERTY
IS A MAJORITY OWNER

11:07.100 --> 11:08.351
IN A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT

11:08.460 --> 11:11.065
THAT MAYOR CHANNING
VOWED TO OPPOSE.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.831
SWAGERTY KILLS CHANNING,
TOMORROW'S CITY COUNCIL VOTE

11:12.940 --> 11:16.159
GOES IN HIS FAVOR,
HE MAKES MILLIONS.

11:16.270 --> 11:18.830
- OKAY, WELL, AS COMPELLING
AS YOUR THEORY IS, MR. SPENCER,

11:18.940 --> 11:20.703
I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE

11:20.810 --> 11:21.902
THAN CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE
BEFORE I TELL

11:22.010 --> 11:23.079
THE PEOPLE OF SANTA BARBARA

11:23.180 --> 11:24.909
THAT THEIR MAYOR WAS MURDERED.

11:25.010 --> 11:26.341
- THIS MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
THINK ABOUT IT.

11:26.450 --> 11:27.940
IT'S THE SAME MOTIVE
AS THE BIBLICAL TALE

11:28.050 --> 11:29.449
OF THE VERY FIRST MURDER--
BROTHER KILLS BROTHER

11:29.550 --> 11:31.848
OVER MULTI-USE RETAIL
AND RESIDENTIAL SPACE.

11:31.950 --> 11:32.757
- WHAT VERSION OF THE BIBLE
ARE YOU READING?

11:32.860 --> 11:35.818
- THE NEW RICK JAMES VERSION.
- OKAY.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.059
CHIEF, UNLESS SPENCER
HAS ANY OTHER THEORIES,

11:38.160 --> 11:39.127
CAN I GO AHEAD AND TELL WOODY
TO OFFICIALLY RULE

11:39.230 --> 11:40.959
CHANNING'S DEATH
AN ACCIDENT?

11:41.060 --> 11:41.992
- YES.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.169
- THANK YOU.

11:43.270 --> 11:47.161
- SORRY, MR. SPENCER.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.461
- THIS JUST SUCKS.

11:50.570 --> 11:51.935
IN FOUR
DAYS, SWAGERTY'S GONNA BE

11:52.040 --> 11:53.837
BOTH MAYOR AYNUDPA MURDERER.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.305
YOU KNOW THE WORST PART
OF THIS?

11:55.410 --> 11:57.378
ONCE SWAGERTY BECOMES MAYOR,
HE'LL HAVE CONTROL

11:57.480 --> 11:58.879
OVER THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

11:58.980 --> 12:00.140
I GUARANTEE YOU
HE'LL MAKE SURE

12:00.250 --> 12:01.376
THEY DON'T LOOK
INTO CHANNING'S MURDER.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.469
- HOW COULD HE GET AWAY
WITH THAT?

12:02.580 --> 12:04.138
- IT'S ALL IN THE BYLAWS.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.753
- DUDE, YOU STOLE THE BYLAWS
FROM CHANNING'S OFFICE?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.088
- THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE BYLAWS

12:08.190 --> 12:09.748
THAT SAYS IT'S ILLEGAL
TO STEAL BYLAWS, SHAWN.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.259
- REALLY?
IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BYLAWS

12:11.360 --> 12:14.898
THAT SAYS...
[snores]

12:15.000 --> 12:16.058
SERIOUSLY, MAN.

12:17.030 --> 12:17.598
WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO KEEP SWAGERTY

12:17.700 --> 12:19.099
OUT OF OFFICE LONG ENOUGH

12:19.200 --> 12:20.792
TO BUILD A SOLID CASE
AGAINST HIM.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.437
- WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

12:23.540 --> 12:25.132
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.468
- GUS, I'VE GOT NEWS.

12:26.570 --> 12:27.969
GUYS HAVE BEEN MANSCAPING
FOR YEARS.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.243
- WHAT? LISTEN, SHAWN.
LOOK. RIGHT HERE.

12:31.350 --> 12:32.908
IT SAYS
THE HEAD OF THE CITY COUNCIL

12:33.020 --> 12:34.749
WILL AUTOMATICALLY SUCCEED
THE MAYOR

12:34.850 --> 12:36.317
UNLESS CHALLENGED
BY ANOTHER CANDIDATE,

12:36.420 --> 12:38.911
IN WHICH CASE
A SPECIAL ELECTION MUST BE HELD.

12:38.950 --> 12:39.109
BOOM.

12:40.390 --> 12:41.982
- SO WE JUST NEED
ANOTHER CANDIDATE.

12:42.090 --> 12:44.024
- YUP.

12:48.560 --> 12:53.463
- AND SO IT IS
WITH THAT SAME SENSE OF PRIDE

12:53.570 --> 12:58.906
AND A RENEWED HOPE
FOR UNBOUND GLORY

12:59.010 --> 13:00.830
THAT I, SHAWN SPENCER,

13:00.940 --> 13:03.841
DO HEREBY DECLARE
MY CANDIDACY

13:03.950 --> 13:07.511
FOR THE OFFICE
OF MAYOR.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.316
[applause]

13:12.390 --> 13:14.051
- [deranged laughter]

13:14.160 --> 13:15.354
[thud, mic feedback]

13:15.460 --> 13:16.552
- GUS, I'M NOT EVEN SURE
THIS THING IS ON.

13:16.660 --> 13:19.959
- WE HEARD YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.119
[mic feedback]

13:25.570 --> 13:27.390
- NOW, SHAWN,
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

13:27.500 --> 13:29.934
THAT YOUR FIRST TV INTERVIEW
IS A SUCCESS.

13:30.040 --> 13:31.564
- DON'T WORRY,
IT WILL BE,

13:31.670 --> 13:34.002
AS LONG AS THEY FILM ME
FROM ONE OF MY 27 GOOD SIDES.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.099
- I DREW UP A LIST OF TOPICS

13:35.210 --> 13:36.472
FOR YOU TO FAMILIARIZE
YOURSELF WITH--

13:36.580 --> 13:38.377
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES,
CRIME STATISTICS,

13:38.480 --> 13:40.448
LABOR ISSUES.
- HMM.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.040
THAN KS, WENDY.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.141
SHE USED TO BE A CANDY STRIPER.
- REALLY?

13:44.250 --> 13:45.808
- NO, BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A FUN THING.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.319
- WHAT?
- THIS IS NICE. THANKS, MAN.

13:47.420 --> 13:50.025
- NO.
NO, NO, NO.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.222
BARACK AND MICHELLE
GOT SLAMMED IN THE PRESS

13:51.330 --> 13:53.025
AFTER DOING THAT IN PUBLIC.

13:53.130 --> 13:55.018
WE'LL STICK TO CULTURALLY
NEUTRAL SALUTATIONS

13:55.130 --> 13:56.324
UNTIL WE SEE SOME POLLING.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.421
- DUDE, I THINK
YOU CAN AFFORD

13:58.530 --> 14:00.839
TO ROVE IT DOWN A NOTCH.

14:00.940 --> 14:01.964
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO WIN,
REMEMBER?

14:02.070 --> 14:03.037
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO KEEP A KILLER

14:03.140 --> 14:04.300
FROM TAKING OVER THE CITY.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.059
- I KNOW, SHAWN,

14:06.170 --> 14:07.330
BUT YOU STILL DON'T WANT
TO LOOK RIDICULOUS.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.101
THEY MAY ASK YOU
THE TOUGH QUESTIONS.

14:09.210 --> 14:11.007
- FOOD CARTS?
- YOU PLAN TO HAVE A FOOD CART

14:11.110 --> 14:13.010
ON EVERY CORNER
BY THE END OF YOUR MANDATE.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.042
- YES, I DO.
- NOW, LISTEN, SHAWN.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.141
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
THE RULE.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.957
YOU NEVER, NEVER ANSWER
THE QUESTION THEY ASKED YOU.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.382
ONLY ANSWER THE QUESTION...
- I WISH THEY HAD ASKED ME.

14:23.490 --> 14:26.584
- MY MAN.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.129
- WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU EFFECTIVE
AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.367
- IN TWO WORDS,
APPROACHABILITY.

14:35.470 --> 14:37.006
MY DOOR WILL ALWAYS BE OPEN.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.964
AND I WANT THE CITIZENS
OF SANTA BARBARA

14:39.070 --> 14:41.402
TO FEEL COMFORTABLE
MARCHING THROUGH THAT DOOR

14:41.510 --> 14:44.047
AND TELLING ME ABOUT THE ISSUES
THAT MATTER TO THEM,

14:44.150 --> 14:47.540
AND THE ISSUES THAT MATTER
TO THEIR PETS.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.509
- MR. SPENCER,
AS YOU KNOW, THE CITY

14:51.620 --> 14:55.078
HAS BEEN RECENTLY DIPPING INTO
ITS CASH RESERVES TO CLOSE

14:55.190 --> 14:57.920
AN ESTIMATED $26 MILLION
GENERAL FUND DEFICIT.

14:58.030 --> 15:00.225
- [whistles]
- IF ELECTED, HOW DO YOU PROPOSE

15:00.330 --> 15:02.059
TO CLOSE THIS GAP?

15:02.160 --> 15:07.291
- [exhales] WELL, THAT
IS AN OUTSTANDING QUESTION,

15:07.400 --> 15:08.537
[enunciates gutturally]
JOSEPHINA.

15:08.640 --> 15:10.005
AM I SAYING THAT CORRECT LY?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.135
- NO.
- THE ANSWER IS SIMPLE.

15:12.240 --> 15:17.473
MY LEAST FAVORITE
IS THE BLACK JELLY BEAN,

15:17.580 --> 15:20.572
AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE IT'S BLACK.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.547
BELIEVE ME,
SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS

15:23.650 --> 15:25.288
ARE BLACK JELLY BEANS.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.950
BUT, IF I WANTED
TO BE EATING LICORICE,

15:28.060 --> 15:29.982
WHY WOULD I REACH
FOR A JELLY BEAN?

15:30.090 --> 15:32.126
YOU FEEL ME?
I SUSPECT YOU DO.

15:32.230 --> 15:34.425
AND HERE'S
A FREE GOLDEN NUGGET.

15:34.530 --> 15:36.691
I ALSO VOW
TO PROTECT OUR FINE CITY

15:36.800 --> 15:39.268
FROM INVADERS TO THE NORTH

15:39.370 --> 15:41.691
AND THE WEST,
AND I WILL ONLY USE

15:41.800 --> 15:46.237
THE FUNDAMENTALS OF TRADITIONAL
BRAZILIAN JIU-JITSU.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.378
BOOM.
FOLLOW-TH ROUGH.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.004
BOOM.
RAIN DANCE.

15:51.110 --> 15:54.011
THAT'S FROM
ALONG CAME POLLY.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.647
- STAY WITH US.
- IDIOT.

15:59.750 --> 16:02.457
- YOU LOOKED LIKE
A COMPLETE LUNATIC, SHAWN.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.687
AFTER THAT, I'M PRETTY SURE
I'M THE ONLY PERSON

16:04.790 --> 16:06.348
IN SANTA BARBARA
THAT'S GONNA VOTE FOR YOU.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.553
- PERFECT. THAT MEANS
I'VE GOT THE BLACK VOTE.

16:08.660 --> 16:10.560
[telephone rings]

16:10.670 --> 16:12.069
- PSYCH OFFICE
AND CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.092
- SHAWN.
JUST SAW YOUR INTERVIEW.

16:14.200 --> 16:15.997
KUDOS.
FINALLY, SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS

16:16.100 --> 16:17.601
TO THE ISSUES I CARE ABOUT.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.962
LISTEN, I HAVE NEWS
ON THE CHANNING CASE.

16:20.080 --> 16:23.004
USUALLY WHEN I INSPECT
LACERATIONS OF SURFERS

16:23.110 --> 16:24.372
WHO EAT IT AT THE VORTEX,

16:24.480 --> 16:26.072
I FIND, YOU KNOW,
LITTLE BITS OF CORAL

16:26.180 --> 16:27.442
AND ROCK IN THE WOUNDS.

16:27.550 --> 16:28.972
CHANNING'S IS CLEAN.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.219
- DAMN IT,
I KNEW IT.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.015
- AND I FOUND GRAY HAIRS
IN HIS WETSUIT.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.157
PRELIMINARY TESTS
REVEAL THEY'RE NOT HIS.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.285
- THAT YOU'RE HERE
HELPING THE WAY YOU ARE.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.449
- WOODY, YOU COMPLETE ME.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.755
- THE GRAY HAIRS.
IT'S SWAGERTY'S, ISN'T IT?

16:42.800 --> 16:43.164
- I'LL GIVE YOU A HINT:
YES.

16:45.230 --> 16:47.039
- YOU DO UNDERSTAND
HOW HINTS WORK, RIGHT?

16:47.140 --> 16:48.562
[door opens, closes]

16:48.670 --> 16:50.103
- STRAUB.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.302
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE, MAN?

16:51.410 --> 16:52.536
- I SAW YOUR INTERVIEW,
AND I'D LIKE

16:52.640 --> 16:54.005
TO ASSIST YOU
IN YOUR CAMPAIGN.

16:54.110 --> 16:55.179
- AND WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO DO THAT?

16:55.280 --> 16:56.508
- BECAUSE, LIKE YOU,

16:56.610 --> 16:58.009
I DON'T WANT SWAGERTY
TO BE MAYOR.

16:58.110 --> 16:59.998
I DON'T TRUST HIM.
- NEITHER DO WE.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.747
- THAT'S WHAT I JUST SAID.

17:01.850 --> 17:03.511
- HERE'S THE THING,
STRAUB.

17:03.620 --> 17:07.056
SHAWN ALREADY HAS
A CAMPAIGN MANAGER: ME.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.616
AND I'VE ALREADY GOT
ALL THE BASES COVERED.

17:08.720 --> 17:11.427
- REALLY? SO YOU'VE COVERED
ALL POTENTIAL SCANDALS?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.555
- 100%.
- WHAT ABOUT THIS?

17:13.660 --> 17:16.049
- [laughs]

17:16.160 --> 17:17.718
- A MUSTACHE
IS VERY MAYORAL.

17:17.830 --> 17:20.060
- PLUS FRANCO NERO.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.536
- LOOK, FIRST WE NEED
TO WORK ON YOUR IMAGE.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.131
THE PUBLIC SEES YOU AS A GLIB,
FLAKY, OVERINDULGENT ADOLESCENT

17:25.240 --> 17:28.403
WHO SPENDS WAY TOO MUCH TIME
WITH HIS BEST FRIEND.

17:28.510 --> 17:30.603
- I'M NOT GLIB.
WHAT'S GLIB?

17:30.710 --> 17:32.701
- YOU.
- SHAWN, WITH MY HELP,

17:32.810 --> 17:35.074
WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN OUTSIDE SHOT
OF WINNING THIS THING.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.114
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT

17:37.220 --> 17:39.609
OF THE ABBY SHELDON INCIDENT.
- WHO'S THAT?

17:39.720 --> 17:41.415
- SWAGERTY'S LATE FIANCEE.

17:41.520 --> 17:44.182
SHE TRAGICALLY FELL AT HOME
ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO AND DIED.

17:44.290 --> 17:47.123
IT MAKES HIM VERY SYMPATHETIC
IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND.

17:47.230 --> 17:49.050
- HE'S SO LUCKY.
- SHAWN.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.094
- LET ME GET YOU
THE EXPOSURE YOU NEED,

17:51.200 --> 17:52.224
AND YOU CAN BEAT HIM
ON YOUR OWN TERMS.

17:52.330 --> 17:55.094
- I LIKE THE SOUND OF THIS
VERY MUCH.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.703
STRAUB, CONSIDER YOURSELF
MY NEW CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.698
- CO-CAMPAIGN MANAGER.
- WHATEVER.

17:59.810 --> 18:02.301
- EXCELLENT.
WE'LL START BY HAVING YOU

18:02.410 --> 18:04.139
GO TO THE FOUNDERS' GALA
TOMORROW.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.775
- [giggles] HE SAID "GALA."
- I HEARD HIM, SHAWN.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.108
- ALL THE BIG PLAYERS IN TOWN
WILL BE THERE,

18:08.220 --> 18:09.175
PLUS THE MEDIA.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.781
NOW, THE VOTERS
LIKE A CANDIDATE

18:10.890 --> 18:12.141
WHO'S IN
A STABLE RELATIONSHIP,

18:12.250 --> 18:14.218
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO BRING A DATE.

18:14.320 --> 18:16.709
- THAT'S GOING TO BE
A LITTLE DIFFICULT.

18:16.820 --> 18:19.823
- WELL, MAYBE NOT.

18:27.740 --> 18:31.267
I'VE ARRIVED.
[laughs]

18:31.370 --> 18:32.803
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.808
YOU REALLY DO LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
BY THE WAY.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.512
- THANK YOU,
BUT REMEMBER, I'M HERE

18:43.620 --> 18:45.110
FOR THE SAME REASONS
YOU ARE.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.778
- WHAT?
YOU'RE RUNNING FOR MAYOR?

18:46.890 --> 18:48.778
- TO INVESTIGATE SWAGERTY
BASED ON THE NEW EVIDENCE.

18:48.890 --> 18:50.152
THAT'S IT.
GOT IT?

18:50.260 --> 18:51.784
- GOT IT.
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

18:51.830 --> 18:52.182
- GOOD.
- JUST STANDARD INVESTIGATING.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.818
SCOPING OUT CLUES
AND LEADS,

18:58.930 --> 19:01.398
AND POSSIBLY KISSING.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.229
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.604
- A LOT OF STUFF TO DO
IN A LITTLE AMOUNT OF TIME,

19:05.710 --> 19:07.132
SO STAY FOCUSED.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.275
AS SOON AS YOU
GET THE CHANCE,

19:08.380 --> 19:09.733
THAT'S OUR HOST,
ANDREW HOBBS.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.149
HE HAS A YACHT
AND LOVES DEEP-SEA FISHING.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.673
- GOT IT. HOBBS, FAT,
LIKES TO MURDER FISH.

19:14.780 --> 19:15.849
- AND THAT IS LEECY DAVIS.

19:15.950 --> 19:17.383
VERY DEEP POCKETS.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.388
SHE ALSO HAS A WEAKNESS
FOR YOUNG MEN

19:18.490 --> 19:19.411
PLAYING VOLLEYBALL--

19:19.520 --> 19:21.215
SHIRTLESS.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.185
I'LL BE READY WITH ALL MY BEST
C. TOMMY HOWELL QUOTES

19:23.290 --> 19:24.848
FROM SIDE OUT.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.824
- WATCH OUT FOR THE STUFFED
MUSHROOM APPETIZERS.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.397
IT'S A SCAM JOB.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.149
IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S SAUSAGE INSIDE,

19:29.260 --> 19:30.864
BUT IT'S REALLY
ALL VEGETABLES.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.188
- THAT IS OUTRAGEOUS.
- DAMN IT.

19:34.670 --> 19:36.535
WITH SHOTS
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.902
YOU HAVE TO GET IN THERE,
STEAL THAT SPOTLIGHT.

19:38.010 --> 19:39.807
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY THAT TWICE.

19:39.910 --> 19:41.775
- REMEMBER TO GRAB THE HAIR.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.370
NOT YOURS.
SWAGERTY'S.

19:43.480 --> 19:46.301
- RIGHT. WE GOTTA CONNECT HIM
TO THE MURDER.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.684
- MY DAUGHTER NICOLE.
STRAIGHT-"A" STUDENT.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.189
HONEY, THERE'S UNCLE JUDD
OVER THERE.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.359
WHY DON'T YOU GO SAY HELLO
TO HIM FOR ME?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.189
- [clappin
HUH? g]

19:55.290 --> 19:57.884
- CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR CANDIDACY, SHAWN.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.855
- CONGRATS ON THE SPINACH
IN YOUR TEETH.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.428
YOU ARE GOING DOWN.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.293
- "GOING DOWN"?
SERIOUSLY?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.220
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THE ELECTION?

20:06.330 --> 20:07.695
- NEGATIVE.
WHERE WERE YOU THE NIGHT

20:07.800 --> 20:10.405
BEFORE CHANNING'S BODY
WAS FOUND?

20:10.510 --> 20:12.205
- NOT THAT IT'S
ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

20:12.310 --> 20:14.471
BUT I WAS AT MY DAUGHTER'S
VIOLIN RECITAL.

20:14.580 --> 20:17.208
- WHAT ABOUT THE MORNING OF?
- SHE HAD SOCCER PRACTICE.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.777
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.269
- UH, WHY DO YOU HATE ART
AND HOMELESS ANIMALS?

20:21.380 --> 20:22.916
- ARE YOU TELLING ME
YOU THINK CHANNING WAS KILLED?

20:23.020 --> 20:24.419
- I DON'T KNOW.
WAS HE?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.545
- I'M NOT GONNA DIGNIFY THAT
WITH A RESPONSE.

20:26.650 --> 20:27.787
I LIKED CHANNING.

20:27.890 --> 20:28.914
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH HIS DEATH.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.851
- MM-HMM.
- HEY!

20:30.960 --> 20:33.895
- [exclaims and laughs]

20:34.000 --> 20:35.991
[shutters snapping furiously]

20:36.100 --> 20:38.295
"SUMMER JUST GOT
A LITTLE BIT HOTTER."

20:38.400 --> 20:39.799
DID YOU GUYS GET THAT?

20:39.900 --> 20:43.961
SIDE OUT.
C. TOMMY HOWELL.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.945
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

20:51.050 --> 20:52.870
BEFORE WE CONTINUE
WITH THE FESTIVITIES,

20:52.980 --> 20:54.743
I'D LIKE TO TAKE THIS TIME
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

20:54.850 --> 20:57.444
OUR LATE, GREAT MAYOR,
MR. GAVIN CHANNING,

20:57.550 --> 20:59.984
WHO WAS TAKEN FROM US
FAR, FAR TOO SOON.

21:00.090 --> 21:03.457
HE WAS A PRINCIPLED POLITICIAN
AND A GREAT FRIEND,

21:03.560 --> 21:05.824
AND WE WILL TRULY MISS HIM.

21:05.930 --> 21:07.329
TO GAVIN CHANNING.

21:07.430 --> 21:09.819
- HEAR, HEAR.

21:21.640 --> 21:22.607
- YOU WANT TO DANCE?

21:22.710 --> 21:23.699
[applause]

21:23.810 --> 21:24.947
- NO.
- GOOD.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.006
THANK GOD.
NEITHER DO I.

21:27.110 --> 21:30.887
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE
IT'S A NECESSARY PART

21:30.990 --> 21:32.719
OF THIS INVESTIGATION.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.014
I GOT TO STAY IN THIS RACE.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.884
RIGHT NOW, SWAGS
IS STEALING ALL MY THUNDER.

21:36.990 --> 21:39.879
- WELL, TOO BAD FOR YOU
YOU DON'T DANCE.

21:39.990 --> 21:42.925
- YEAH, TOO BAD.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.949
- WHEN WE WENT
TO TAKE THE DANCE CLASS,

22:00.050 --> 22:01.677
YOU SAID YOU HAD SHIN SPLINTS.

22:01.780 --> 22:04.544
- NOT ENTIRELY TRUE.

22:04.650 --> 22:06.789
I WENT TO THE MONTECITO
SCOTTISH VENTRILOQUIST FESTIVAL

22:06.890 --> 22:07.879
WITH GUS.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.810
I FELT SO GUILTY
ABOUT LYING TO YOU

22:09.860 --> 22:10.019
THAT I WENT BACK
AND TOOK THAT DANCE CLASS

22:12.790 --> 22:13.791
ALL BY MYSELF.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.424
- YOU DID?

22:15.530 --> 22:17.794
- THEY SAY IT'S ALL ABOUT
YOUR CONNECTION

22:17.900 --> 22:19.697
WITH YOUR PARTNER.
IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PARTNER,

22:19.800 --> 22:21.859
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN'T DO.

22:25.070 --> 22:26.833
[applause]
- WHERE WAS THIS SHAWN SPENCER

22:26.940 --> 22:27.975
WHEN WE WERE DATING?

22:28.080 --> 22:30.002
- HE'S RIGHT HERE.

22:33.850 --> 22:36.739
JULES.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.041
[sighs]

22:44.030 --> 22:46.726
- [exhales]

22:49.930 --> 22:52.763
- JULES.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.360
COME ON.

22:54.470 --> 22:55.789
YOU CANNOT PRETEND

22:55.900 --> 22:57.538
THAT YOU DON'T STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR ME.

22:57.640 --> 22:58.766
IT DOES NOT MAKE
FOR VERY GOOD THEATER.

22:58.870 --> 23:01.703
- WELL, I WON'T PRETEND,
SHAWN,

23:01.810 --> 23:03.072
BECAUSE I DO.

23:03.180 --> 23:04.841
BUT I ALSO CAN'T PRETEND

23:04.950 --> 23:06.872
THAT I CAN TRUST YOU.
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

23:06.980 --> 23:10.518
- JULES, SWEETHEART,
YOU CAN TRUST ME, OKAY?

23:10.620 --> 23:13.953
LOOK, I LIED.
I LIED ABOUT BEING A PSYCHIC,

23:14.060 --> 23:17.086
AND THAT PROBABLY ACCOUNTS
FOR THOUSANDS OF LIES

23:17.190 --> 23:19.454
THAT I HAVE TOLD YOU
SINCE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER,

23:19.560 --> 23:21.994
AND, THE WORST PART IS,
NOBODY BELIEVED IN ME

23:22.100 --> 23:23.761
MORE THAN YOU.

23:23.870 --> 23:24.996
YOU ALWAYS HAD MY BACK

23:25.100 --> 23:27.466
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

23:27.570 --> 23:29.891
I FEEL SO HORRIBLE
ABOUT THAT.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.969
- I NEED YOU
TO UNDERSTAND

23:33.070 --> 23:35.800
YOU ARE ON THE HOOK
UNTIL YOU MAKE IT

23:35.910 --> 23:38.174
SO THAT I DON'T HAVE
TO LIE FOR YOU ANYMORE.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.907
IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

23:40.010 --> 23:43.741
YOU HAVE
TO TELL THE CHIEF.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.983
- NO, JULES,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.626
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
BECAUSE, IF I DO THAT,

23:52.730 --> 23:54.459
THEN ALL OF THIS GOES AWAY,
ALL OF IT.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.697
AND WITH IT GOES THE GOOD.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.496
ALL THE LIVES
THAT I HAVE SAVED,

23:58.600 --> 24:01.933
THE LIVES
THAT I'VE IMPROVED.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.667
THIS IS--THIS IS WHAT I HAVE,
JULES.

24:03.770 --> 24:05.135
THIS IS HOW I DO GOOD.

24:05.240 --> 24:09.074
- NOT FOR EVERYONE.

24:16.720 --> 24:17.914
- HEY, SWAGS,

24:18.020 --> 24:20.716
NO HARD FEELINGS, OKAY?

24:20.820 --> 24:22.981
- OW!

24:23.090 --> 24:25.979
WHAT THE HELL?

24:29.100 --> 24:31.864
OKAY.
THAN KS, WOODMAN.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.939
- GUESS WHAT?
SWAGERTY'S ALIBI CHECKED OUT.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.132
AND HERE'S THE WORST NEWS--

24:36.240 --> 24:38.162
HE TOOK THE WETLANDS VOTE
OFF THE AGENDA.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.067
I'M NOT SO SURE
HE'S OUR GUY ANYMORE.

24:41.880 --> 24:42.039
WOODY JUST CONFIRMED THAT
THE GRAY HAIR THEY FOUND

24:43.950 --> 24:45.838
ON CHANNING'S BODY
DID NOT BELONG TO SWAGERTY.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.039
- THERE GOES OUR THEORY.
WHAT NOW?

24:48.080 --> 24:49.911
- FIRST, I DROP OUT
OF THE RACE IMMEDIATELY.

24:50.020 --> 24:51.612
THE BEST MAN
GETS TO BE MAYOR.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.608
WE FIND OURSELVES
ANOTHER SUSPECT.

24:53.720 --> 24:54.880
NO HARM, NO FOUL.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.082
IT'S LIKE MODERN WAR.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.088
- YOU DID IT, SHAWN.

24:57.190 --> 24:59.624
YOU KILLED IT AT THE GALA.

24:59.730 --> 25:00.992
THE BUZZ
IS YOU'RE CRUSHING SWAGERTY.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.591
SO I TOOK A STRAW POLL
UP AND DOWN STATE STREET

25:03.700 --> 25:04.962
OF POTENTIAL VOTES.
- AND?

25:05.070 --> 25:07.891
- YOU'RE GONNA BE MAYOR.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.769
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT SPENCER
MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN THIS THING?

25:20.880 --> 25:22.973
OH, MY GOD.
THE MAYANS WERE RIGHT.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.081
- THAT'S IT.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO MOVE.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.111
THERE'S NO OTHER SOLUTION.

25:25.220 --> 25:26.642
- WILL YOU GUYS CALM DOWN?

25:26.750 --> 25:27.978
SHAWN IS NOT
GOING TO BE MAYOR.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.512
IT'S JUST
FOR THE INVESTIGATION.

25:29.620 --> 25:31.224
- THESE THINGS HAVE A WAY
OF SNOWBALLING, GUSTER.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.924
ONE DAY, HE'S MAYOR, THE NEXT,
HIS FACE IS ON OUR CURRENCY.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.019
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M GOING TO HAVE

25:35.130 --> 25:36.825
TO ASSASSINATE
A PUBLIC FIGURE.

25:36.930 --> 25:37.897
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.592
HE RAN FOR OFFICE
ON THE PROMISE

25:39.700 --> 25:41.236
HE'D BUILD A THUNDERDOME
IN THE SCHOOLYARD?

25:41.340 --> 25:45.265
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT
THAT IDIOT'S GOT PLANNED NOW.

25:45.370 --> 25:47.008
- THAT IS AN EXCELLENT QUESTION,
TINA.

25:47.110 --> 25:49.931
IT'S ESSENTIALLY
A GIANT CAGE-LIKE STRUCTURE,

25:50.040 --> 25:53.271
AN ARENA WHERE CONFLICT
CAN BE SOLVED IN A PUBLIC FORUM.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.918
MY ADMINISTRATION
WILL BE ALL ABOUT TRANSPARENCY,

25:57.020 --> 25:58.942
HOT DOG WIENERS
OF UNUSUAL LENGTHS,

25:59.050 --> 26:02.759
AND GLADIATORIAL JUSTICE.
- SPENCER!

26:02.860 --> 26:04.157
GET YOUR ASS IN HERE!

26:04.260 --> 26:05.750
- THAT GUY WILL NOT BE HERE

26:05.860 --> 26:06.952
WHEN I AM RUNNING
THIS DEPARTMENT.

26:10.330 --> 26:11.991
ARE YOU INSANE?

26:12.100 --> 26:13.988
- OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

26:14.100 --> 26:16.762
IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE MAYOR.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.599
FOR MORE THAN TWO TERMS.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.029
I'M JUST GONNA MAKE
A FEW SWEEPING CHANGES

26:20.140 --> 26:21.971
HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT,
AND THEN I'M OUT OF HERE.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.071
OH, LASSIE, RELAX.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.205
I'M GONNA WITHDRAW.
SWAGERTY'S CLEAN.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.618
- AND THE BEST MAN
FOR THE JOB.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.971
- YOUR DISLOYALTY
DISHEARTENS ME--

26:29.080 --> 26:31.014
IS WHAT I WOULD SAY
IF I WAS STILL RUNNING.

26:31.120 --> 26:33.008
BUT I'M NOT.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.610
- AS MUCH AS IT PAINS ME
TO SAY, SHAWN,

26:34.720 --> 26:36.688
YOU CAN'T WITHDRAW.
NOT NOW.

26:36.790 --> 26:37.984
YOU'RE IN THE PUBLIC EYE,
KID.

26:38.090 --> 26:40.854
IF YOU BAIL,
IT'S GONNA RAISE QUESTIONS

26:40.960 --> 26:42.359
AND SUBJECT YOU
TO A LITTLE MORE SCRUTINY

26:42.460 --> 26:44.018
THAN I THINK YOU WANT.

26:44.130 --> 26:46.189
- RIGHT, WELL,
IN THAT CASE,

26:46.300 --> 26:48.689
WE SHOULD PROBABLY EASE UP
ON THE REINS A BIT.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.597
YOU KNOW, COME UP WITH A WAY
TO SUBTLY THROW THIS THING.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.029
- I CAN FIX THAT.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.903
- GREAT.
GUS, YOU ARE REHIRED

26:54.010 --> 26:55.671
AS MY SOLO CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.077
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MAKE ME SEEM

26:57.180 --> 26:58.738
LESS DESIRABLE,
WHICH WON'T BE EASY.

26:58.850 --> 27:00.374
- I CAN FIX THAT.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.869
- HERE'S THE QUESTION.

27:02.920 --> 27:03.079
IF SWAGERTY DIDN'T KILL
CHANNING, THEN WHO DID?

27:05.190 --> 27:07.784
I MEAN, WHO ELSE HAD MOTIVE?

27:09.790 --> 27:10.927
- THOSE ARE MEXICAN TURQUOISE.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.952
HE USED TO BRING THEM

27:13.060 --> 27:14.095
FROM HIS REMOTE SURF SPOTS
IN MEXICO

27:14.200 --> 27:15.292
AND GIVE 'EM TO PEOPLE
AS GIFTS.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.618
- WHAT IS GENIUS?

27:17.730 --> 27:18.958
CAN YOU BOTTLE IT?

27:19.070 --> 27:21.664
IS IT SOMETHING YOU WOULD
EVEN WANT TO BOTTLE?

27:21.770 --> 27:23.829
- HE WAS A PRINCIPLED POLITICIAN

27:23.940 --> 27:24.964
AND A GREAT FRIEND.

27:25.070 --> 27:26.059
TO GAVIN CHANNING.

27:26.170 --> 27:28.274
- HIS WIFE!

27:28.380 --> 27:31.747
I AM SENSING THAT CHANNING
WAS A PLAYER!

27:31.850 --> 27:33.374
THAT HE CHEATED
ON HIS WIFE WILLY-NILLY,

27:33.480 --> 27:35.016
AND THE SPENCERS DO NOT USE

27:35.120 --> 27:36.849
THE TERM "WILLY-NILLY"
WILLY-NILLY.

27:36.950 --> 27:38.212
- NO, WE DON'T.
- WAIT A MINUTE.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.982
WOODY FOUND A GRAY HAIR
ON CHANNING'S BODY.

27:41.090 --> 27:41.954
SHE'S NOT GRAY.

27:42.060 --> 27:46.986
- ARE THESE PEOPLE IMPORTANT?

27:47.090 --> 27:50.719
- ONLY HER STYLIST
KNOWS THAT FOR SURE.

27:53.070 --> 27:57.029
- AH! AH!
[moans]

27:57.140 --> 28:00.439
WHOA.
HO. HO. HO. HO.

28:00.540 --> 28:02.872
HELLO, RENEE.

28:02.910 --> 28:03.069
- SHAWN.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU RODE.

28:05.550 --> 28:09.873
- IT'S JUST ABOUT ALL WE DO
IN MY HOMETOWN OF SNOWY RIVER.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.140
IT HELPS ME FIND CLARITY.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.683
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

28:12.790 --> 28:14.382
I'M GETTING SOME RIGHT NOW.

28:14.490 --> 28:17.152
- ARE YOU?
FASCINATING.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.750
- WHAT I'M GETTING
IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND

28:18.860 --> 28:22.193
HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH MONOGAMY!

28:22.300 --> 28:24.996
WAIT, LIGHTNING!
- WELL, NOW, YOU JUST UNEARTHED

28:25.100 --> 28:26.897
THE WORST-KEPT SECRET
IN SANTA BARBARA.

28:26.930 --> 28:27.089
YES, GAVIN WAS INCORRIGIBLE.

28:29.300 --> 28:30.904
- SEABISCUIT, STOP, STOP.

28:30.940 --> 28:31.099
- IT WAS ONE
OF HIS BEST QUALITIES, REALLY.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.301
WE'D BEEN LIVING APART
FOR SOME TIME.

28:37.410 --> 28:39.071
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
OUR MARRIAGE WAS A...

28:39.180 --> 28:41.045
- SHAM?
HYAH!

28:41.150 --> 28:43.118
- A CAREER MOVE.

28:43.220 --> 28:46.212
- WHITE CHOCOLATE.
I DON'T KNOW THE HORSE'S NAME.

28:49.090 --> 28:50.057
AND THAT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU
AT ALL?

28:50.160 --> 28:51.889
- NO.
- MRS. CHANNING,

28:51.930 --> 28:52.089
I'M READY FOR YOU.

28:53.130 --> 28:55.052
- IN A MOMENT, ANTONIO.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.458
- HYAH!

28:57.560 --> 28:59.869
- LET'S JUST SAY
THAT GAVIN AND I

28:59.970 --> 29:01.835
HAD AN UNDERSTANDING.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.807
- LET'S CUT
TO THE CHASE HERE, RENEE.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.969
A GRAY HAIR WAS FOUND
ON YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.379
THE SAME GRAY HAIR YOU USED
TO HAVE BEFORE YOU COLORED IT.

29:09.480 --> 29:11.300
I KNOW YOU WERE THERE
THE NIGHT HE DIED.

29:11.410 --> 29:12.946
- YES, I WAS WITH HIM.

29:13.050 --> 29:15.211
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.413
WE SLEPT TOGETHER.

29:17.520 --> 29:20.148
- THAT IS DISGUSTING.
AND RICH.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.911
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

29:22.020 --> 29:24.227
- WELL, I WANTED TO GET
SOMETHING FOR MY 50 GRAND.

29:24.330 --> 29:28.118
- WE NEEDED THE 50 GRAND
FOR AN EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE.

29:28.230 --> 29:30.255
'CAUSE, EVEN THOUGH
HE WAS A TERRIBLE HUSBAND,

29:30.360 --> 29:32.089
HE WAS A GREAT LOVER,

29:32.200 --> 29:34.532
AND WOULD HAVE BEEN
A FABULOUS GOVERNOR.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.939
I REALLY WANTED TO MAKE LOVE
IN THAT MANSION...

29:38.040 --> 29:39.905
WITH ANTONIO.

29:39.940 --> 29:40.099
[giggIeSJ

29:42.040 --> 29:45.009
WELL, I'M BORED.

29:45.110 --> 29:46.042
[horse neighs]

29:46.150 --> 29:48.038
COME ON.

29:52.350 --> 29:53.988
[horse whinnies]
- [exclaims]

29:54.090 --> 29:55.910
ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT SHOWING ME PASSED OUT

29:56.020 --> 29:56.952
SURROUNDED BY BEER CANS

29:57.060 --> 29:58.482
IS NOT EXACTLY MY IDEA

29:58.590 --> 29:59.921
OF A NUANCED PHOTO.

29:59.960 --> 30:00.119
- WELL, IF YOU HATED THAT,

30:01.400 --> 30:03.095
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE
THIS COMMERCIAL.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.360
IT'S ABOUT TO START AIRING.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.995
- WHAT?
DUDE, WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL?

30:07.100 --> 30:09.068
- YUP. I SLICED ONE TOGETHER
LAST NIGHT

30:09.170 --> 30:10.535
AND GOT THE LOCAL STATION
TO AIR IT

30:10.640 --> 30:11.937
IN EXCHANGE FOR YOU
GIVING FREE PSYCHIC READINGS

30:12.040 --> 30:13.200
FOR THE NEXT YEAR.
- SMART THINKING.

30:13.310 --> 30:14.937
- YEAH.

30:15.040 --> 30:16.530
- I'M SHAWN SPENCER,
AND THIS IS MY VISION

30:16.640 --> 30:18.039
FOR SANTA BARBARA.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.004
- [chuckles]

30:20.110 --> 30:22.840
- OOH.
[bombs whistling, horns honking]

30:24.590 --> 30:29.084
OOH.
[baby crying]

30:33.130 --> 30:35.223
WOW.
- SORRY, MAN.

30:35.330 --> 30:37.491
I HAD TO GO BIG.
- THE BIRD THING WAS MESSED UP.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.090
- RIGHT.
- BUT SOME OF THOSE

30:39.200 --> 30:41.088
WEREN'T FAR FROM THE TRUTH.
- I KNOW.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.135
[cell phone rings]

30:44.240 --> 30:46.299
- STRAUB.

30:46.410 --> 30:48.970
- HOW COME I WASN'T CONSULTED
ON THAT COMMERCIAL?

30:49.080 --> 30:50.945
- 'CAUSE GUS IS RUNNING
THE SHOW SOLO NOW.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.278
SORRY I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

30:52.380 --> 30:54.018
BUT I JUST
HAVEN'T BEEN SATISFIED

30:54.120 --> 30:55.109
WITH THE WAY
MY CAMPAIGN'S BEING MANAGED.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.017
- COMPETENTLY?
- EXACTLY.

30:57.120 --> 30:57.939
BY THE WAY,
DID YOU KNOW

30:58.690 --> 30:59.543
THAT CHANNING
DID GET THE 50K

31:00.550 --> 31:00.584
FOR THE EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE
FROM HIS WIFE

31:01.160 --> 31:02.559
THE NIGHT THAT HE DIED?

31:03.490 --> 31:05.355
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

31:10.160 --> 31:12.094
- NOT IF HE NEVER HAD
THE OPPORTUNITY.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.293
- WHAT?
- GOT TO BOUNCE.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.890
GUS, I HAVE IT.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.137
CHANNING WAS ROBBED.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.105
HIS WIFE GAVE HIM THE 50K,

31:19.210 --> 31:20.359
SOMEONE BROKE INTO THE HOUSE,
STOLE THE MONEY,

31:20.470 --> 31:22.904
AND KILLED HIM
USING THAT MISSING BOOKEND.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.477
THE ONE THE KILLER
TOOK WITH THEM

31:24.580 --> 31:26.047
AFTER THEY CLOBBERED CHANNING
OVER THE HEAD.

31:26.150 --> 31:27.606
SO IT MUST HAVE BEEN
AN INSIDE JOB.

31:27.710 --> 31:31.089
SOMEONE WITH ACCESS
TO THIS HOUSE.

31:36.090 --> 31:39.628
PERHAPS WE SHOULD START
WITH THOSE.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.550
HEY, LASSIE.
- SO I HAVE ELIMINATED

31:41.660 --> 31:43.389
THE HOUSEKEEPER
AND THE GARDENER,

31:43.500 --> 31:44.398
WHICH PRETTY MUCH LEAVES
THE PLUMBER.

31:44.500 --> 31:45.990
GUY NAMED MIKE PLUMMER.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.931
- HE'S A PLUMMER
AND HIS NAME IS PLUMBER?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.337
- I DON'T SAY THINGS
TO BE HUMOROUS.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.634
OOH, SPEAKING OF HUMOROUS,

31:50.740 --> 31:52.401
YOU, MY FRIEND,
ARE GETTING KILLED

31:52.510 --> 31:53.909
AT THE POLLS.

31:54.010 --> 31:54.931
ARE YOU AWARE
THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN

31:55.040 --> 31:57.907
JUST AIRED AN AD
DETAILING YOUR FOOT FETISH?

31:58.010 --> 32:00.149
IT WAS QUITE DISTURBING.

32:00.250 --> 32:04.038
- FOOT FETISH?
COME ON, SON.

32:07.050 --> 32:11.350
LOOKS LIKE MIKE THE PLUMBER
CAME INTO SOME CASH.

32:11.460 --> 32:14.020
HELLO?
- HELLO.

32:14.130 --> 32:15.950
- MIKE PLUMMER THE PLUMBER?

32:21.470 --> 32:25.065
- UH, SHAWN.

32:25.170 --> 32:28.503
- YO.
WHAT YOU GOT?

32:41.790 --> 32:42.154
- WHERE HAVE I SEEN
THAT DUDE BEFORE?

32:45.060 --> 32:46.618
[applause]

32:49.700 --> 32:52.328
SNIFF AROUND THE BODY
OR SOMETHING.

32:52.430 --> 32:54.136
I'M GONNA GO SNOOP
ON HIS COMPUTER.

32:54.240 --> 32:55.730
- WHY DO I GOT
TO HANG AROUND A DEAD BODY?

32:55.840 --> 32:58.968
- BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT.

33:07.150 --> 33:10.039
- DUDE, I JUST FOUND
A BANK STATEMENT

33:10.150 --> 33:12.311
THAT SHOWS A RECENT DEPOSIT
OF $50,000.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.980
- HOW RECENT?
LIKE FOUR DAYS AGO RECENT?

33:15.090 --> 33:17.979
- YUP. THE DAY AFTER CHANNING
GOT THAT MONEY FROM HIS EX-WIFE.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.251
YOUR THEORY ABOUT HIM
ROBBING CHANNING WAS ON POINT.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.055
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HOLD ON.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.393
- TOM, THIS IS SHAWN SPENCER
AND BURTON GUSTER.

33:27.500 --> 33:30.333
GUYS, THIS IS THE CITY'S
NEW MAYOR, TOM SWAGERTY.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.169
- THAT'S ABBY SHELDON,

33:32.270 --> 33:35.034
SWAGERTY'S EX-FIANCEE.

33:35.140 --> 33:38.075
- WHAT IS SHE DOING
AT CHANNING'S HOUSE?

33:40.180 --> 33:43.343
- ASKED AND ANSWERED.

33:43.450 --> 33:46.385
THAT CHANNING
WAS A RANDY LITTLE SPANIEL.

33:49.290 --> 33:51.121
UH-OH.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.024
LET ME SEE THAT.

34:00.670 --> 34:05.403
BAM, THERE WAS ANOTHER DEPOSIT
MADE TWO MONTHS EARLIER,

34:05.510 --> 34:08.604
FOUR DAYS
AFTER ABBY'S DEATH.

34:08.710 --> 34:11.599
I GOT IT.
- GOOD. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

34:11.710 --> 34:13.473
- I MEAN,
WHY SHOULD I GET FINED

34:13.580 --> 34:15.116
FOR NOT PICKING UP
MY DOG'S POOP?

34:15.220 --> 34:16.539
HUH?
WHY?

34:16.650 --> 34:19.118
- GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

34:19.220 --> 34:20.710
EXCUSE ME.
SO SORRY.

34:20.820 --> 34:23.152
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.

34:23.260 --> 34:25.125
I AM ACTUALLY HERE
BECAUSE I HAVE HAD

34:25.230 --> 34:26.219
A PSYCHIC REVELATION

34:26.330 --> 34:27.729
THAT WILL SHAKE
THE FOUNDATION

34:27.830 --> 34:31.095
OF SANTA BARBARA
TO ITS VERY FOUNDATION.

34:31.200 --> 34:32.269
HERE'S THE THING.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.464
ABBY SHELDON DID NOT DIE
ACCIDENTALLY

34:35.570 --> 34:38.334
IN HER HOME,
AS WAS WIDELY REPORTED.

34:38.440 --> 34:42.103
SHE, IN FACT, EXPIRED
IN THE HOME OF HER LOVER,

34:42.210 --> 34:45.145
THE MAN THAT WE ALL KNEW
AS FORMER MAYOR GAVIN CHANNING.

34:45.250 --> 34:48.071
[people gasping
and whispering]

34:48.180 --> 34:51.286
- I MEAN, DOES MY DOG GET A BILL
EVERY TIME I DO MY BUSINESS?

34:51.390 --> 34:52.812
HUH? YEAH.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.387
- THE POINTS YOU'RE MAKING
ARE VALID.

34:54.490 --> 34:57.653
BUT I'M GONNA BE UP HERE
FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,

34:57.760 --> 35:01.389
SO YOU'D BE WISE
TO TAKE A SEAT.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.855
THANK YOU.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.793
GAVIN CHANNING,
FOR ALL HIS FLAWS,

35:06.900 --> 35:08.834
WAS NOT A MURDERER.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.704
NOW I AM SENSING
THAT ABBY SHELDON'S DEATH

35:11.810 --> 35:13.698
WAS, IN FACT,
ACCIDENTAL.

35:13.810 --> 35:17.302
- ABBY!

35:17.410 --> 35:19.799
- WHAT DOES ANY POLITICIAN DO
WHEN THEY'RE IN A JAM?

35:19.910 --> 35:21.468
THEY CALL
THEIR RIGHT-HAND MAN,

35:21.580 --> 35:23.775
AND, IN THIS CASE,
THAT RIGHT-HAND MAN

35:23.820 --> 35:24.184
WAS JASON STRAUB...
[crowd gasping]

35:26.750 --> 35:29.480
WHO, FOR THE RECORD,
IS A LEFTY.

35:29.590 --> 35:31.387
SURE ENOUGH,
THAT IS THE FIRST CALL

35:31.490 --> 35:33.378
THAT CHANNING MADE
THE NIGHT ABBY DIED,

35:33.490 --> 35:35.890
ACCORDING TO THE PHONE RECORDS
OBTAINED

35:36.000 --> 35:40.221
BY SBPD'S VERY OWN
CARLTON LASSITER.

35:40.330 --> 35:42.867
I AM SENSING
THAT YOU MOVED ABBY'S BODY

35:42.970 --> 35:45.131
FROM CHANNING'S HOUSE
BACK TO HER HOUSE,

35:45.240 --> 35:47.731
STILL MADE IT LOOK
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

35:49.940 --> 35:52.477
BUT THERE WERE A COUPLE THINGS
THAT YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.309
FIRST BEING CHANNING'S
CONTRACTOR, MIKE PLUMMER.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.638
BEING THE OPPORTUNIST
THAT HE WAS,

35:56.750 --> 35:59.548
HE JUMPED AT THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DOCUMENT

35:59.650 --> 36:02.210
THIS POTENTIAL SCAN DAL.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.787
[shutter snaps]

36:03.890 --> 36:06.154
YOU CAN FIND THESE PHOTOGRAPHS
AT HIS APARTMENT.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.784
- AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

36:07.890 --> 36:11.155
- BECAUSE MY SENSES
DON'T LIE, THEY MULTIPLY.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.159
ANYWAY, MIKE PLUMMER
USED THESE PHOTOGRAPHS

36:14.270 --> 36:17.865
TO BLACKMAIL CHANNING
TO THE TUNE OF $50,000.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.699
CHANNING THOUGHT
IT WAS A ONE-TIME PAYOUT.

36:19.810 --> 36:22.938
THEN A COUPLE MONTHS LATER,
PLUMMER SHOWS UP AGAIN

36:23.040 --> 36:24.940
AND HE ASKS FOR MORE.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.371
CHANNING WAS READY
TO COME CLEAN, BUT STRAUB,

36:27.480 --> 36:29.641
THE MAN WHO ORCHESTRATED
THE ENTIRE COVER-UP,

36:29.750 --> 36:31.547
DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL,
DID YOU?

36:31.650 --> 36:33.618
- COME ON, NOBODY'S BELIEVING
THIS LUNATIC, RIGHT?

36:33.720 --> 36:35.483
- JASON, SIT DOWN.

36:35.590 --> 36:38.229
- YOU PLEADED WITH CHANNING

36:38.330 --> 36:39.479
NOT TO DO IT,
AND WHEN HE REFUSED,

36:39.590 --> 36:42.229
FINALLY YOU KILLED HIM.

36:42.330 --> 36:43.297
- THAT'S ENOUGH!

36:43.400 --> 36:46.267
THE OTHER THING--
[grunts]

36:46.370 --> 36:47.598
- YOU STUFFED HIM
INTO HIS WETSUIT

36:47.700 --> 36:49.839
AND YOU DUMPED HIM
INTO THE OCEAN.

36:49.940 --> 36:51.635
THE OTHER THING
YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON

36:51.740 --> 36:54.277
WAS THAT THE MAN
WHO SUCCEEDED CHANNING AS MAYOR

36:54.380 --> 36:56.735
IS THE SAME GUY
WHO WAS NOT CONVINCED

36:56.840 --> 36:58.205
THAT THE ACCIDENTAL DEATH
OF HIS FIANCEE

36:58.310 --> 36:59.572
WAS AN ACCIDENT...

36:59.680 --> 37:01.443
- JUST CAME BY HERE
TO GIVE YOU THESE.

37:01.550 --> 37:02.539
A FEW KEY OBJECTIVES
I'D LIKE TO GET WORKING ON

37:02.650 --> 37:03.912
IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.817
- BECAUSE AMONG THE LIST
OF KEY OBJECTIVES

37:05.920 --> 37:07.717
HE GAVE YOU
WAS A MOTION TO REOPEN

37:07.820 --> 37:10.789
THE POLICE INVESTIGATION
INTO THE DEATH OF HIS FIANCEE.

37:10.820 --> 37:10.979
YOU NEEDED TO MAKE SURE

37:12.590 --> 37:14.797
THAT SWAGERTY
WASN'T ELECTED MAYOR,

37:14.900 --> 37:16.390
AND THAT IS WHY YOU TRIED
TO HELP ME BEAT HIM,

37:16.500 --> 37:17.956
BUT WHEN THAT DIDN'T WORK,

37:18.060 --> 37:20.290
YOU KILLED THE ONLY PERSON,
PLUMMER,

37:20.400 --> 37:21.890
THAT COULD TESTIFY
AGAINST YOU

37:22.000 --> 37:24.969
IN A FUTURE TRIAL.

37:25.070 --> 37:28.335
COME ON, STRAUB.
GIVE IT UP.

37:33.350 --> 37:34.715
DON'T--DON'T DO IT.

37:34.820 --> 37:37.539
DON'T--OH.

37:37.650 --> 37:41.279
- HAVE SOME RESPECT
FOR YOURSELF.

37:41.390 --> 37:42.687
- THAT'S IT.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.850
I NOW CEDE THE FLOOR
TO THE CRAZY POOP WOMAN.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.827
GOD BLESS SANTA BARBARA.

38:02.010 --> 38:03.307
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.401
WE COULD TURN AROUND,
GET RED ROBIN,

38:05.510 --> 38:06.977
GO BACK TO THE PSYCH OFFICE.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.877
AMERICAN DUOS
PREMIERES TONIGHT.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.847
- [laughs]

38:11.950 --> 38:16.887
I OWE YOU ONE, MAN.
- YOU OWE ME INFINITY, SHAWN.

38:29.770 --> 38:31.635
- IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

38:31.740 --> 38:33.367
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE CHIEF.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.958
[door opens and shuts]

38:51.060 --> 38:55.053
- YOU NOTICED THE DOOR
WAS CLOSED, RIGHT?

38:55.160 --> 38:56.991
SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND?

38:57.100 --> 38:58.397
- YEAH, ACTUALLY,
IT'S MY MIND

38:58.500 --> 38:59.762
THAT I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT, CHIEF?

38:59.870 --> 39:02.088
YOU--YOU KNOW
THOSE BLACKMAIL PHOTOS

39:02.200 --> 39:03.462
FROM THE CHANNING CASE, RIGHT?
YOU REMEMBER THOSE?

39:03.570 --> 39:04.867
- IT WAS THREE DAYS AGO.

39:04.970 --> 39:06.403
- OH, RIGHT, WELL,
THE FUNNY THING IS,

39:06.510 --> 39:08.637
AND TRUTH IS
IT'S NOT FUNNY AT ALL,

39:08.740 --> 39:10.901
I MAY NOT
HAVE COME ACROSS THOSE

39:11.010 --> 39:12.875
IN THE MANNER THAT
YOU'VE GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.777
- I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.939
- WHAT I'M SAYING, CHIEF,
IS THAT IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

39:17.050 --> 39:20.110
THAT I HAVE BEEN
LESS THAN FORTHRIGHT

39:20.220 --> 39:23.986
ABOUT THE WAY THAT I DO
THE THINGS THAT I DO.

39:24.090 --> 39:26.752
LIKE THIS.
THIS, FOR EXAMPLE.

39:28.460 --> 39:31.759
MAINLY THAT REALLY.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.758
WHAT I'M SAYING
IS THAT I'M SORRY,

39:33.870 --> 39:35.394
BUT THAT I'M NOT ACT UALLY--
- HE'S COVERING FOR ME.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.058
- WHAT?
- SHAWN LED ME

39:37.170 --> 39:38.967
TO THE BLACKMAIL PHOTOS,
AND I OBTAINED THEM

39:39.070 --> 39:42.039
WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL WARRANT.
- I'M SORRY?

39:42.140 --> 39:44.574
- WE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
THE EVIDENCE IF WE'D WAITED.

39:44.680 --> 39:46.477
- SO YOU SEARCHED THE VICTIM'S
COMPUTER WITHOUT A WARRANT?

39:46.580 --> 39:47.945
- YES, I DID.

39:48.050 --> 39:51.042
BUT IT WAS JUST THE ONE TIME,
I SWEAR.

39:51.150 --> 39:53.015
- YOU UNDERSTAND THAT,
IF A JUDGE KNEW ABOUT THIS,

39:53.120 --> 39:54.985
STRAUB WOULD WALK?

39:55.090 --> 39:57.411
FORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF US,
WE GOT A CONFESSION FROM HIM.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.953
- WHEW.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.654
WELL, THEN I GUESS--
I GUESS WE'RE GOOD HERE.

40:01.760 --> 40:02.852
ORANGE WHIP?
ORANGE WHIP?

40:02.960 --> 40:06.088
- NO, MR. SPENCER,
WE ARE NOT GOOD AT ALL.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.737
YOU ARE A POLICE OFFICER,
MS. O'HARA.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.958
AND, MR. SPENCER, YOU ARE A...
- PSYCHIC.

40:13.070 --> 40:15.937
- I WAS GOING TO SAY
AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR,

40:16.040 --> 40:17.974
AND BOTH OF YOU SERVE
THE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY.

40:18.080 --> 40:19.877
AND EVERYTHING
IS TO REMAIN ABOVEBOARD.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.447
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

40:21.550 --> 40:23.609
- YES, CHIEF.
- YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

40:23.720 --> 40:26.644
- GOOD.

40:27.690 --> 40:30.750
YOU'RE DISMISSED.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.896
GOOD-BYE, MR. SPENCER.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.969
- LATER, CHIEF.

40:50.040 --> 40:51.439
JULES, LET'S NOT MAKE THIS

40:51.550 --> 40:53.006
ANY MORE COMPLICATED
THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.

40:53.110 --> 40:54.748
I KNOW EXACTLY WHY YOU DID
WHAT YOU DID

40:54.850 --> 40:55.942
WITH THE CHIEF THIS MORNING.

40:56.050 --> 40:57.449
- REALLY?
DO TELL.

40:57.550 --> 40:59.040
- WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS,
DON'T YOU THINK?

40:59.150 --> 41:02.153
I MEAN, WITHOUT ME,
SANTA BARBARA TURNS INTO DETROIT

41:02.260 --> 41:03.659
WITHIN A WEEK.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.024
- THAT'S NOT IT.
- IT'S NOT?

41:06.130 --> 41:07.779
- SHAWN,
WHEN I FIRST ASKED YOU

41:07.890 --> 41:09.027
TO TELL THE CHIEF
THE TRUTH

41:09.130 --> 41:10.950
AND YOU DECLINED,

41:11.060 --> 41:12.960
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU WERE BEING SELFISH.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.867
BUT THEN YOU WERE ACTUALLY
GOING TO TELL HER.

41:14.970 --> 41:15.994
IT HIT ME--

41:16.100 --> 41:17.931
IF I LET YOU
GO THROUGH WITH THIS

41:18.040 --> 41:20.099
AND THROW EVERYTHING AWAY,

41:20.210 --> 41:22.872
WELL...

41:22.980 --> 41:24.845
I'D BE THE ONE
BEING SELFISH, WOULDN'T I?

41:24.880 --> 41:25.039
I COULDN'T LET YOU.

41:26.650 --> 41:28.971
- GUS IS SO THANKFUL.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.583
- I KNOW.

41:31.690 --> 41:34.818
- SO SHOULD WE JUST DO IT?

41:34.920 --> 41:36.114
- EASY.

41:36.220 --> 41:38.051
I'M NOT READY
TO GET BACK TOGETHER.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.027
I MEAN, THERE'S STILL AN ISSUE
OF TRUST HERE.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.997
I CAN'T JUST FLIP A SWITCH.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.091
- THAT'S FAIR.
- MM.

41:46.200 --> 41:48.168
SHAWN.
- YES?

41:48.270 --> 41:51.194
- IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.961
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU JUST TELL ME

41:53.070 --> 41:54.799
WHEN YOU'RE READY,
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE WAITING.

41:54.910 --> 41:58.277
IN MY STOCKING FEET,
WEARING A CHEF'S HAT

41:58.380 --> 42:00.041
AND AN APRON.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.617
AND THAT'S IT.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.948
- HMM.

42:03.050 --> 42:05.712
- NOW WHO'S READY
FOR SOME SOUPLANTATION?

42:05.820 --> 42:08.709
- SOUP?
SOUP I CAN DO.

42:08.820 --> 42:09.855
- WHAT ABOUT BISQUE?

42:09.890 --> 42:10.049
I'M HOPING
THERE'S A BISQUE.

42:12.060 --> 42:14.051
- [giggIeSJ
- WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LUCK,

42:14.160 --> 42:15.889
THEY'LL HAVE
THE VEGGIE CHILI.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.058
- OH, I LOVE
THE VEGGIE CHILI.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.196
- IT'S VERY CHUNKY.
- IT IS CHUNKY,

42:19.300 --> 42:22.235
BUT I LOVE MY CHILI CHUNKY.
