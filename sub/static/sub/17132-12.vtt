WEBVTT

00:03.637 --> 00:06.307
OH, MAN, I'M TOO LATE.
ANGIE'S GOT THE BILLS.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.309
WELL, SO WHAT'S
THE BIG DEAL?

00:08.309 --> 00:10.311
I WENT A LITTLE CRAZY
WITH MY RAISE,

00:10.311 --> 00:13.314
AND I DROPPED A TON OF CASH
ON SOME NEW GOLF CLUBS.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.616
I WAS HOPING TO GET
THE CREDIT CARD BILL

00:15.616 --> 00:17.618
BEFORE ANGIE
HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IT.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.321
YOU HIDE THINGS YOU BUY
FROM YOUR WIFE?

00:20.321 --> 00:22.323
(imitates Ernie)
YOU HIDE THINGS

00:22.323 --> 00:24.725
YOU BUY
FROM YOUR WIFE?

00:24.725 --> 00:27.728
(normal voice) DUDE,
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA GET A WOMAN

00:27.728 --> 00:29.597
SO YOU CAN LEARN
HOW THIS STUFF WORKS?

00:29.597 --> 00:32.333
I'M TIRED OF EXPLAINING
EVERYTHING TO YOU.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.335
YOUR ADVICE
DOESN'T WORK ANYWAY.

00:34.335 --> 00:37.438
IF YOU HADN'T HOOKED UP
WITH ANGIE WHEN YOU WERE 18,

00:37.438 --> 00:40.074
YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE JUST LIKE MINE.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.082
THAT IS THE WORST THING

00:48.082 --> 00:51.552
THAT YOU HAVE
EVER SAID TO ME.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.787
GOOD LUCK, MAN.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.825
HEY, BABY.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.194
HEY. WHAT?! (gasps)

01:00.194 --> 01:02.130
THE CREDIT CARD BILL
IS HUGE!

01:02.130 --> 01:03.664
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

01:03.664 --> 01:07.635
YOU GET SO STRESSED OUT
WHEN YOU DO THE BILLS, HUH?

01:07.635 --> 01:09.837
COME ON.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.673
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES...

01:12.673 --> 01:14.175
AND RELAX.

01:14.175 --> 01:17.411
YOU KNOW, ANGIE,
YOU GOT A HUGE KNOT HERE.

01:17.411 --> 01:21.048
MM.
I'M GONNA USE MY ELBOW.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.184
(moans)

01:27.988 --> 01:30.158
OKAY, ALL DONE.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.561
THAT'S WEIRD.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.697
THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE THE PAGES
THAT LIST ALL OUR CHARGES.

01:36.697 --> 01:40.601
I BET THEY'RE CUTTING BACK
ON PAPER.

01:40.601 --> 01:44.438
GLOBAL WARMING, AL GORE...
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.440
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S FINE.

01:46.440 --> 01:50.110
I'LL JUST LOOK UP
THE BILL ONLINE.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.981
YOU CAN DO THAT?

01:53.981 --> 01:56.684
YEAH.
JUST TAKE A SECOND.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.686
A-ANGIE,
I-I FORGOT TO TELL YOU

01:58.686 --> 02:00.688
THAT I BOUGHT
A SET OF NEW GOLF CLUBS,

02:00.688 --> 02:03.757
AND I'LL PLAY SO GOOD THAT IT'LL
SHAVE AN HOUR OFF MY ROUND,

02:03.757 --> 02:07.761
WHICH MEANS I CAN SPEND
MORE TIME WITH THE FAMILY,

02:07.761 --> 02:09.963
AND YOU CAN'T PUT
A PRICE TAG ON THAT.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.699
$900?!

02:11.699 --> 02:13.767
THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

02:13.767 --> 02:16.504
WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO SPEND LIKE THIS.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.806
COME ON, ANGIE. WITH MY RAISE,
THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY

02:18.806 --> 02:21.008
IN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT
TO COVER IT.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.110
THERE ISN'T... ANYMORE.

02:23.110 --> 02:26.814
WHAT?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.650
$300 FOR A SPA TREATMENT?!

02:29.650 --> 02:31.652
I WENT
TO GET MY HAIR DONE,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.654
BUT THE SPA
WAS OFFERING REIKI MASSAGES,

02:33.654 --> 02:35.689
AND I THOUGHT
I'D TRY ONE OUT.

02:35.689 --> 02:39.693
WHO'S REIKI
AND WHERE'D HE TOUCH YOU?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.696
IT'S NOT A PERSON,
GEORGE.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.698
IT'S AN ASIAN ENERGY MASSAGE,

02:44.698 --> 02:46.667
AND THEY DON'T EVEN
TOUCH YOU.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.169
THEY JUST PUT THEIR HANDS
OVER YOUR BODY

02:49.169 --> 02:51.672
AND AFFECT
YOUR ENERGY FIELDS.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.908
$300, AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN
GET TOUCHED?

02:56.944 --> 03:01.549
THERE. THAT SHOULD MAKE UP
FOR MY GOLF CLUBS.

03:01.549 --> 03:02.950
OKAY.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.452
WE'RE BOTH GUILTY.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.454
IF WE KEEP
SPENDING LIKE THIS,

03:06.454 --> 03:08.456
WE'LL JUST BLOW THROUGH
YOUR WHOLE RAISE.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.324
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
CHECK WITH ME

03:10.324 --> 03:13.727
BEFORE YOU SPEND MONEY
ON ANYTHING BIG?
AND YOU'LL CHECK WITH ME.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.929
OKAY.
WELL, WE HAD A GOOD PLAN.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.432
YOU JUST RUINED IT.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.969
NO, LET'S TALK
TO EACH OTHER

03:21.969 --> 03:24.805
BEFORE WE SPEND
ANYTHING OVER $100.

03:24.805 --> 03:28.075
THAT WAY, YOU HAVE
TO DEFEND WHAT YOU SPEND.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.010
OKAY.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.781
TONIGHT I'M GOING
TO A POKER GAME...
MM-HMM.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.082
HERE IN THE HOUSE.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.018
I'D LIKE
TO HAVE $150 CASH.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.020
MM.
SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.555
LET'S HEAR
YOUR DEFENSE.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.326
OKAY.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.794
POKER RELAXES ME.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.829
I MAKE MONEY DOING IT,
ESPECIALLY TONIGHT

03:48.829 --> 03:51.832
'CAUSE I'M-A USE THE CARDS WITH
THE GIRLS IN BIKINIS ON 'EM,

03:51.832 --> 03:54.835
AND ERNIE'S GOT A CRUSH
ON THE 2, 4, AND THE 6,

03:54.835 --> 03:57.638
AND EVERY TIME HE MOANS,
HE'S LIKE THAT... "OH."

03:57.638 --> 04:00.140
I KNOW HE'S GOT LOW CARDS.

04:00.140 --> 04:03.544
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE YOU THE $150.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.479
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

04:05.479 --> 04:06.980
OKAY, MY TURN.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.919
YESTERDAY,
I SAW A PAIR OF SHOES

04:11.919 --> 04:13.287
THAT I REALLY WANT,

04:13.287 --> 04:15.222
AND THEY'RE $200.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.991
HMM...

04:17.991 --> 04:19.560
NO. VETO.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.365
YOU HAVE TO LET ME
DEFEND IT.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.967
MM. OKAY.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.569
(clears throat)

04:28.569 --> 04:33.040
OKAY, THIS IS A NEW KIND
OF ERGONOMICALLY CORRECT SHOE,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.376
AND NORMALLY, THEY'RE $300,

04:35.376 --> 04:37.010
BUT THEY'RE ON SALE,

04:37.010 --> 04:39.947
AND THERE'S ONLY
ONE PAIR LEFT IN MY SIZE.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.650
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THIS WAS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU.

04:42.650 --> 04:44.952
I WAS GONNA SAY, "VETO,"

04:44.952 --> 04:48.722
BUT NOW I'M GONNA STAND UP
AND PUT MY HAND ON YOUR SHOULDER

04:48.722 --> 04:51.058
AND SAY IT ALL NICE...
(gently) VETO.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.865
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:00.968 --> 05:04.104
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:04.104 --> 05:07.107
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:07.107 --> 05:10.310
**

05:18.018 --> 05:19.820
ARE YOU HAVING FUN

05:19.820 --> 05:22.222
WITH THE POKER MONEY
I SHOULD HAVE VETOED?

05:22.222 --> 05:25.893
NO. I'VE BEEN GETTING
HORRIBLE CARDS ALL NIGHT.

05:25.893 --> 05:28.462
WELL, I HOPE
YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.464
IF YOU'D LET ME
BUY THOSE SHOES,

05:30.464 --> 05:32.032
I'DSTILL HAVE THEM.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.333
I KNOW.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.070
ALL RIGHT, BETTER SAY GOOD-BYE
TO THE REST OF MY MONEY.

05:37.070 --> 05:40.173
AND I WILL CALL
AND PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.843
I CALL, TOO.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.381
ERNIE.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.982
OH.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.452
SHE'S SO HOT.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.254
WAAPAHH!

05:54.254 --> 05:57.391
I'M BACK.
(laughs) I'M BACK.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.059
YOU THOUGHT I HAD NOTHING.

05:59.059 --> 06:01.061
YOU CAME DOWN
JUST AT THE RIGHT TIME.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.197
ALL THAT TALK ABOUT "I HOPE
YOU LEARNED YOUR LESSON"--

06:04.197 --> 06:05.633
THEY TOTALLY BELIEVED IT!

06:05.633 --> 06:07.100
I WAS SERIOUS.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.604
GIVE IT A REST, BABY.
IT'LL NEVER WORK TWICE. HEY!

06:14.575 --> 06:16.577
I COULD JUST KILL HIM.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.279
FIRST, HE CHEATS ME
OUT OF MONEY,

06:19.279 --> 06:20.581
AND THEN HE USES ME

06:20.581 --> 06:22.983
AND EMBARRASSES ME
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.753
OH, I WISH SOMEONE
WOULD CLEAN HIM OUT,

06:25.753 --> 06:28.355
SO HE'D HAVE TO COME TO ME
FOR MORE MONEY,

06:28.355 --> 06:31.825
THEN I'D SAY NO.
HOW BAD DO YOU
WANT HIM TO LOSE?

06:31.825 --> 06:34.695
WHY?
ARE YOU GOOD AT POKER?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.697
DAD WAS A CARD SHARK.

06:36.697 --> 06:39.199
I CAN HAVE YOUR SHOE MONEY
IN TEN MINUTES.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.268
THIS ONE TIME IN VEGAS,

06:41.268 --> 06:43.070
I BEAT THIS GUY SO BAD

06:43.070 --> 06:46.239
HE HAD A TOTAL BREAKDOWN
IN FRONT OF HIS FRIENDS.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.576
GOD, I LOVE
TO MAKE MEN CRY.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.111
FIRST,
LET'S GET MY SHOE MONEY,

06:51.111 --> 06:52.212
THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT

06:52.212 --> 06:55.583
WHAT SUPPORT GROUP
MIGHT BE RIGHT FOR YOU.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.824
CAN I PLAY BRIDGE
WITH YOU GUYS?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.494
BRIDGE? IT'S TEXAS HOLD'EM,
AND IT'S A MAN'S GAME.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.496
TELL HER, MOM.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.602
VERONICA,
YOU DON'T WANT TO JOIN US.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.403
WE'RE PLAYING
FOR REAL MONEY.

07:16.403 --> 07:20.541
I HAVE MONEY.
I JUST CASHED MY PAYCHECK.
SIT DOWN, SISTER.

07:23.511 --> 07:26.213
OKAY, YOU GUYS,

07:26.213 --> 07:28.916
I'M NOT SURE
IF THIS IS THE RIGHT MOVE,

07:28.916 --> 07:31.985
BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SAY THIS--

07:31.985 --> 07:34.154
I'M ALL IN.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.423
SWEETHEART, DON'T DO THAT.
YOU COULD LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY.

07:36.423 --> 07:40.160
MNH. I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. ARE
YOU IN OR OUT, UNCLE GEORGE?

07:40.160 --> 07:43.263
WELL, YOU HAVE TO LEARN
YOUR LESSON EARLY.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.132
I CALL.
(Vic) FOLD.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.834
FOLD.
I'M DONE.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.136
A KING AND A QUEEN.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.538
POCKET ROCKETS.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.339
OOH, AND 2
IN THE FLOP.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.943
THAT'S QUADS.
YOU'RE DEAD BEFORE THE TURN.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.579
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT,
GEORGE?

07:58.579 --> 08:02.182
DON'T ASK ME.
I DIED BEFORE THE TURN.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.884
WANT TO GO AGAIN?

08:03.884 --> 08:07.521
ANYBODY CAN GET QUADS.
THAT'S NOT SKILL. THAT'S LUCK.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.389
ALL RIGHT.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.558
I'LL DEAL.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.259
WHICH DECK DO YOU WANT?

08:12.259 --> 08:13.360
EITHER.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.596
OKAY.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.253
(Vic) I FOLD.
(Benny) ME, TOO.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.055
(Ernie) I'M OUT.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.925
WELL, I GUESS
IT'S JUST US.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.927
SO YOU THINK
I'M ALL SCARED

08:46.927 --> 08:49.229
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW
TO PLAY A LITTLE POKER?

08:49.229 --> 08:51.765
SEE, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.134
I WAS PLAYING POKER
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.468
RAISE, CALL OR FOLD?

08:55.468 --> 08:59.372
I GOT A PAIN
IN MY CHEST.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.541
I CAN'T BREATHE.

09:02.776 --> 09:07.214
I CALL.
(clears throat)

09:07.214 --> 09:10.150
WAAPAHH?

09:10.150 --> 09:13.086
WERE YOU BY ANY CHANCE
TRYING TO SAY...

09:13.086 --> 09:16.590
WAAPAHH?!

09:16.590 --> 09:20.661
OH, UNCLE GEORGE,
YOU'RE ALL OUT OF MONEY.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.631
WE SHOULD PROBABLY
STOP THERE.

09:23.631 --> 09:26.099
I'LL GET MORE MONEY.
YOU STAY RIGHT THERE.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.102
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO
KNOWS HOW TO HANDLE THE CARDS.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.338
WHAT-TCHA.
HELLO, GIRLS. HEY.

09:38.311 --> 09:43.684
(whispering) I'M SORRY
I TURNED YOU DOWN FOR THE SHOES.

09:46.186 --> 09:49.589
CAN I HAVE
MORE MONEY FOR POKER?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.294
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A YES.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.666
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN MY PURSE?

09:58.666 --> 10:01.001
I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

10:01.001 --> 10:03.003
I'M CHECKING YOUR PURSE
FOR DRUGS.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.605
YOU'VE BEEN
SLEEPING A LOT.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.742
PLEASE, DON'T TEAR
THIS FAMILY APART.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.346
LOOK,

10:13.346 --> 10:16.950
IF YOU NEED MORE MONEY
FOR POKER, JUST ASK.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.419
I'M A LITTLE MORE GENEROUS
THAN YOU ARE.

10:19.419 --> 10:23.290
ALL RIGHT. ANGIE,
CAN I HAVE ANOTHER $100--
VETO!

10:27.928 --> 10:31.098
REVENGE IS NOT
A GOOD COLOR ON YOU...

10:31.098 --> 10:33.934
AND NEITHER WAS
THAT LIME GREEN DRESS

10:33.934 --> 10:36.236
YOU WORE AT DINNER
TWO YEARS AGO.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.573
I KNEW I'D USE IT
IN A FIGHT SOMEDAY,

10:40.573 --> 10:44.444
AND WHAT-TCHA, HERE IT IS.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.380
HERE'S YOUR SHOE MONEY,
AUNT ANGIE.
THANK YOU.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.717
WAIT A MINUTE.
WH-WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:49.717 --> 10:52.419
I WANTED
TO TEACH YOU A LESSON,

10:52.419 --> 10:54.988
AND VERONICA HELPED ME.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.959
I BRING YOUR NIECE
INTO MY HOUSE,

10:58.959 --> 11:01.094
AND YOU USE HER
AGAINST ME?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.864
THAT'S NOT COLD. Â¿SABES QUÃ©?
THAT'S... (speaks Spanish)

11:07.634 --> 11:10.838
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN GO ONLINE
AND LEARN HOW TO PLAY POKER.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.707
JUST CLICK ON "BEGINNER."

11:15.075 --> 11:17.444
YEAH, AND YOU CAN GO
TO smartassniece.com

11:17.444 --> 11:19.379
AND CLICK ON "HOMELESS."

11:24.752 --> 11:27.420
I THINK THERE'S
A BIGGER ISSUE HERE.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.658
YOU HAVE
A SPENDING PROBLEM.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.961
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.662
I GOT A SPENDING PROBLEM,

11:35.662 --> 11:38.298
AND I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT HER.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.601
I HAVE A LOT MORE SELF-CONTROL
THAN YOU DO.

11:41.601 --> 11:44.337
OH, REALLY?

11:44.337 --> 11:47.374
ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE
WHO CAN LIVE ON LESS,

11:47.374 --> 11:50.610
AND WHEN I WIN, I DON'T HAVE
TO ASK YOU FOR POKER MONEY.

11:50.610 --> 11:54.614
OKAY, AND WHEN I WIN, I DON'T
HAVE TO ASK YOU FOR SHOE MONEY.

11:54.614 --> 11:58.018
NOW YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO, RIGHT?

11:58.018 --> 12:01.454
NO MORE
IMAGINARY MASSAGES.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.292
AND IF YOU WANT A MUD MASK,

12:05.292 --> 12:07.260
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT
TILL IT RAINS

12:07.260 --> 12:09.462
AND SHOVE YOUR HEAD
IN A PLANTER.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.898
YOU'LL BE LIKE...

12:14.401 --> 12:15.702
OKAY.

12:15.702 --> 12:18.906
THAT MEANS NO MORE EXPENSIVE
SPORTS JERSEYS FOR YOU.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.707
IT'S NOT LIKE PHIL JACKSON

12:20.707 --> 12:25.813
IS GONNA LOOK UP IN THE STANDS
AND SAY, "HEY, MEXICAN KOBE."

12:28.315 --> 12:32.152
"FINISH THE HOT DOG
AND GET IN THE GAME."

12:33.486 --> 12:36.723
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I GREW UP WITHOUT THAT STUFF.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.225
I WAS POOR, ANGIE.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.360
I COULDN'T EVEN GO SWIMMING
IN A SWIMMING POOL

12:40.360 --> 12:42.963
BECAUSE MY MOM
WOULDN'T BUY ME A SWIMSUIT.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.966
I HAD TO SWIM IN A GARBAGE CAN
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.968
THE WHITE ONES--
THE "DUN DUN DUNS"

12:47.968 --> 12:52.072
WHERE YOU COME OUT LIKE THAT--
"DUN, DUN, DUN."

12:52.072 --> 12:54.374
YOU WANT TO SEE
HOW I DID LAPS?

12:54.374 --> 12:56.376
I WAS LIKE THAT...
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.879
AND I'D DO THE BUTTERFLY.
I'D BE LIKE THAT...

12:58.879 --> 13:00.447
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.150
AND MY FRIENDS WOULD DRIVE BY,
AND I'D BE EMBARRASSED.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.919
I WOULD CLOSE THE LID
AND BE LIKE...

13:13.326 --> 13:15.695
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU SEE IT.

13:15.695 --> 13:19.132
SAVING MONEY ON GAS,
RIDING MY BIKE TO WORK.

13:19.132 --> 13:23.303
WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW WHEN YOU
HAVE TO PICK UP MAX FROM SCHOOL?

13:23.303 --> 13:25.205
(rings bell)

13:27.074 --> 13:29.476
LET'S GO HOME, MAX.
VÃ¡MANOS! PORQUE Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

13:29.476 --> 13:32.379
(rings bell)

13:32.379 --> 13:34.247
WELL, I GOT US DINNER.

13:34.247 --> 13:38.118
I HOPE YOU'RE OKAY
WITH RAMEN NOODLES.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.220
AH! YOU SPENT 50 CENTS!

13:40.220 --> 13:43.790
NO, I PAID FOR THIS
WITH RECYCLED CANS.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.959
YOU WENT DIGGING
THROUGH THE TRASH?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.527
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.797
I GOT 40 EMPTIES FROM
THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR MOM'S CAR.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.935
NOT BAD.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.171
I MADE THESE
THIS MORNING.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.140
FREEZER SNOW CONES.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.375
I GREW UP ON THESE.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.415
(clears throat)
WHAT IS IT?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.618
IT'S ICE THAT I SCRAPED
FROM THE SIDE OF THE FREEZER

14:11.618 --> 14:13.253
WITH A FORK.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.663
IT TASTES LIKE FISH.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.166
OH, YEAH, THAT ONE
WAS NEAR THE FISH STICKS.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.269
I GOT CORN.
YOU WANNA TRADE?
NO.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.308
I'M GOOD. OH...
(clears throat)

14:35.308 --> 14:37.310
BEFORE I FORGET,
ERNIE CALLED,

14:37.310 --> 14:40.513
AND HE SAID THAT THE GAME
IS IN DOUBLE OVERTIME,

14:40.513 --> 14:41.982
AND IT'S TIED.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.316
WHAT?

14:43.316 --> 14:46.286
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I CANCELED THE CABLE.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.558
THAT MEANS
NO MORE SPORTS CHANNELS.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.360
THIS ISN'T GONNA BREAK ME.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.930
I'LL JUST CALL ERNIE TOMORROW
AND ASK HIM THE SCORE.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.166
FACE IT, GEORGE.
YOU UNDERESTIMATED ME.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.168
I'M NOT SPENDING MONEY
ON ANYTHING,

15:01.168 --> 15:03.836
AND I RAN OUT
OF DEODORANT, RAZORS

15:03.836 --> 15:06.473
AND HAIR DYE...

15:06.473 --> 15:09.809
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:09.809 --> 15:13.380
Ã³RALE, PEPÃ© LE PEW.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.486
HOLY CRAP!

15:21.354 --> 15:27.494
I'M MOVING VERY SLOWLY.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.630
DON'T SPRAY ME.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.834
EXCUSE ME.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.104
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS,

15:37.104 --> 15:40.107
SCRAPE A DRY HUNK OF TOOTHPASTE
OFF THE SINK

15:40.107 --> 15:42.209
AND BRUSH MY TEETH.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.046
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:46.046 --> 15:48.581
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
BROKEN ANGIE YET?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.917
SHE'S TOUGHER
THAN I THOUGHT, MOM.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.652
WE RAN OUT OF FABRIC SOFTENER.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.256
HER THONGS ARE LIKE CARDBOARD,
BUT SHE'S STILL WEARING THEM.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.593
I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.230
WHERE IS THE KID
WHO MADE A PILLOW

16:03.230 --> 16:06.033
OUT OF GRASS CLIPPINGS
AND A TRASH BAG?

16:07.800 --> 16:11.371
WHO SURVIVED FOR A MONTH
ON HALLOWEEN CANDY?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.275
WHO USED PAGES
FROM A PHONE BOOK, GEORGE,

16:15.275 --> 16:18.645
WHEN WE RAN OUT
OF TOILET PAPER?

16:18.645 --> 16:21.014
HE'S IN HERE, MOM.
I KNOW HE IS.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.950
WELL,
THEN GET HIM OUT!
I WILL.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.386
OKAY.
I'M-A DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO WIN THIS THING.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.321
YES, GEORGE,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.323
I RAISED YOU
TO BE TOUGHER THAN THAT.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.193
SO THAT'S WHY YOU DID
ALL THOSE THINGS, MOM,

16:33.193 --> 16:35.195
TO TOUGHEN ME UP?

16:35.195 --> 16:39.399
NO, NO, SOME THINGS
WERE JUST FOR FUN.

16:43.203 --> 16:46.373
YOU KNOW, I'LL NEVER FORGET
WHEN YOU INVITED ERNIE OVER

16:46.373 --> 16:50.377
FOR YOUR TRASH CAN
BIRTHDAY POOL PARTY.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.245
YOU KNOW,

16:52.245 --> 16:56.783
THAT WAS THE ONE TIME I WISHED
THAT I HAD A CAMERA.

16:56.783 --> 16:59.319
YOU WERE LIKE THAT...

16:59.319 --> 17:02.189
YOU WERE LIKE THAT...
YOU WERE LIKE THAT...

17:02.189 --> 17:04.391
AND YOU WERE LIKE THIS...

17:10.029 --> 17:11.831
THIS IS STUPID.

17:11.831 --> 17:14.967
IT'S BEEN THREE WEEKS
WITH NO TV OR INTERNET.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.737
ALL I DO IS READ
AND GO TO SCHOOL.

17:19.672 --> 17:25.044
I'M LIKE SOME PIONEER KID
FROM THE '70s.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.846
WELL, I CAN'T HANDLE
ANYMORE EITHER.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.183
THAT'S WHY I GOT A PLAN
TO END IT TONIGHT.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.220
YOUR MOM IS GOING DOWN.

17:36.656 --> 17:39.025
WHY IS IT DARK IN HERE?

17:39.025 --> 17:43.363
SOME OF US DON'T NEED
TO WASTE MONEY ON ELECTRICITY.

17:43.363 --> 17:45.665
I DON'T NEED IT
IF YOU DON'T.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.836
SO WOULD YOU SAY THIS
IS A GOOD MARRIAGE?

17:49.836 --> 17:54.341
BECAUSE IF IT IS, I DON'T KNOW
WHY GAY PEOPLE WANT IT SO MUCH.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.920
SO WHAT'D YOU BUY
FOR DINNER?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.956
I DIDN'T BUY ANYTHING.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.991
AT THE BACK OF THE PANTRY,

18:11.991 --> 18:14.794
I FOUND A COUPLE OF CANS

18:14.794 --> 18:17.830
OF FISHERMAN'S FEAST.

18:19.166 --> 18:23.102
THAT'S CAT FOOD...

18:23.102 --> 18:26.639
FROM WHEN WE HAD A CAT
YEARS AGO.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.108
I KNOW.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.779
IT'S NOT EVEN REAL TUNA.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.815
THEY SPELL IT "T-O-O-N-A."

18:37.184 --> 18:38.818
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD

18:38.818 --> 18:41.654
TO THE "GROUND FISH MEAL
THAT CONTAINS

18:41.654 --> 18:47.327
NO MORE THAN 10% FINS,
BONES AND SCALES."

18:47.327 --> 18:49.262
MMM, MMM!

18:50.763 --> 18:53.300
YOU'RE ACTUALLY
GONNA EAT CAT FOOD?

18:57.904 --> 19:00.240
THIS IS HOW HARD I AM.

19:15.021 --> 19:18.358
(groans)

19:18.358 --> 19:21.761
YOUR TURN, HOOD.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.164
(clears throat)

19:25.164 --> 19:26.799
(sniffs)

19:37.076 --> 19:38.445
IT SMELLS OKAY.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.189
SOMETHING POPPED.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.894
I THINK I BIT AN EYE.

19:58.498 --> 20:00.800
THAT'S OKAY, BABY.
SPIT IT OUT.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.870
NO, I'M WINNING.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.540
LOOK, NEITHER OF US
ARE WINNING.

20:07.540 --> 20:11.411
WE'RE EATING CAT FOOD
IN THE DARK.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.913
BUT WHAT ABOUT
THE CONTEST?

20:13.913 --> 20:17.149
FORGET THE CONTEST.
LET'S JUST CALL IT A DRAW.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.853
OKAY, BUT THEN CAN WE GO BACK
TO SPENDING MONEY NOW?

20:20.853 --> 20:24.223
'CAUSE I REALLY, REALLY WANT
TO SHAVE MY LEGS.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.561
YEAH.
MY LEGS WANT THAT, TOO.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.930
LOOK, ANGIE,
WE CAN SPEND MONEY,

20:30.930 --> 20:32.732
BUT NOT THE WAY WE WERE.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.734
IF THERE'S ONE THING
I LEARNED FROM THIS,

20:34.734 --> 20:37.203
IT'S THAT I DON'T WANT
TO END UP BROKE

20:37.203 --> 20:39.205
AND EATING CAT FOOD
WHEN I RETIRE.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.941
OKAY,
SO NOW WHY DON'T WE

20:41.941 --> 20:44.877
PUT THE REST OF MY RAISE
INTO OUR SAVINGS?
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.314
NOW I THINK
WE CAN AFFORD A PIZZA.

20:47.314 --> 20:50.182
I LOVE YOU.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.751
WHOA, WHOA.
DOWN, KITTY.

20:53.185 --> 20:56.623
WHAT?
WE BOTH ATE CAT FOOD.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.394
NO, I...

21:01.394 --> 21:05.131
I ACTUALLY PRINTED OUT A LABEL
AND PUT IT ON A CAN OF TUNA.

21:05.131 --> 21:09.235
THAT DIDN'T
TASTE LIKE TUNA.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.872
UH, YOURS WASN'T.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.808
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D ACTUALLY EAT IT.

21:15.808 --> 21:19.178
GEORGE!
BUT YOU WON, AND YOUR COAT
IS REALLY SHINY.

21:19.178 --> 21:20.980
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!

21:20.980 --> 21:32.058
DON'T BE MAD.
GET THE KEYS. GET THE KEYS.
