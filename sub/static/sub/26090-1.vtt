   <i> when she sees him today.</i>    

27:52.071 --> 27:54.872
    So, let's just go ahead     
 and cover some ground with him 
          real quick.           

27:54.874 --> 27:57.374
      I know that he's had      
    some challenging areas.     

27:57.376 --> 28:00.678
       <i> He's very people</i>

          <i> distracted.</i>          

28:03.215 --> 28:06.984
If I am walking him and he sees 
   something on the sidewalk    

28:06.986 --> 28:09.653
      <i> that is attractive,</i>      
   <i> he will lunge toward it.</i>    

28:09.655 --> 28:11.221
  <i> Can you give me an example</i>   
     <i> of some of the things</i>     

28:11.223 --> 28:12.256
 <i> that he might try to pick up?</i> 

28:12.258 --> 28:14.458
     - Uh, cigarette butt.      
            <i> - Okay.</i>            

28:14.460 --> 28:16.994

28:16.996 --> 28:18.962
           <i> How often</i>           
<i>do you think that's happening?</i>  

28:18.964 --> 28:20.798
   <i> Oh, it happens every day.</i>   

28:24.804 --> 28:27.004
      [indistinct chatter]      

28:27.640 --> 28:28.972
     There you go. Perfect.     

28:28.974 --> 28:30.240
   <i> I think you're frustrated</i>   
           <i> with him</i>            

28:30.242 --> 28:32.476
          <i> but I think</i>          
  <i> he's actually coming along.</i>  

28:32.478 --> 28:33.944
          <i> So the work</i>          
 <i> that you're putting into him</i>  

28:33.946 --> 28:35.913
    <i> is actually paying off.</i>    

28:35.915 --> 28:37.614
<i>So he's better than I expected.</i> 

28:37.616 --> 28:38.982
    <i> Yes, he does look like</i>     

28:38.984 --> 28:41.085
       <i> he's pretty much</i>        
     <i> where he needs to be.</i>     

28:41.087 --> 28:42.853
 I think just following through 
         with, you know         

28:42.855 --> 28:44.722
      especially the stuff      
         on the ground          

28:44.724 --> 28:46.256
        <i> that's gonna be</i>        
       <i> really important.</i>       

28:46.258 --> 28:49.426
  <i> Because the dog would take</i>   
 <i> advantage of a blind handler.</i> 

28:49.428 --> 28:51.462
      I really didn't have      
         any red flags          

28:51.464 --> 28:53.197
   that went up today at all,   
        which was great

          Right here.           

28:58.471 --> 29:00.571
    Yeah? Are we gonna have     
         a rough start?

        Hey. Excuse me.         

29:04.176 --> 29:05.576

29:05.578 --> 29:07.044
      Primrose, let's go.       

29:07.046 --> 29:10.848
   So she's really struggling   
  to hold position right now.   

29:10.850 --> 29:13.751
    Oh, I'm a little nervous    
     about your eval today.     

29:13.753 --> 29:15.085
       Alright, let's go.       

29:15.087 --> 29:16.286
 <i> She'll be looking for things</i>  

29:16.288 --> 29:18.756

          <i> confidence.</i>          

29:18.758 --> 29:20.257
     <i> Is there any anxiety?</i>

  <i> If the dog makes a mistake</i>   

29:21.560 --> 29:22.993
   <i> do they recover quickly?</i>    

29:22.995 --> 29:24.461
      <i> All of those things</i>      
        <i> that would show</i>        

29:24.463 --> 29:26.497
    <i> that they're resilient,</i>    
      <i> that they would be</i>       

29:26.499 --> 29:29.099
     <i> a good working guide</i>      
        <i> for a partner.</i>         

29:29.101 --> 29:30.634
      Primrose, let's go.       

29:31.704 --> 29:33.570
        <i> We're starting</i>         
     <i> to get pretty serious</i>

      <i> about this process.</i>      

29:34.640 --> 29:36.473
 <i> We're looking for any traits</i>

      <i> to get a handle on</i>       

29:38.611 --> 29:42.045
    <i> that would make the dog</i>    
 <i> unsuccessful in the long run.</i> 

29:42.047 --> 29:44.648
  <i> She's pretty distractible.</i>   

29:44.650 --> 29:47.651
<i>- Um, missed the turn, sweetie.</i> 
         <i> - Excuse me.</i>          

29:47.653 --> 29:48.852
  <i> That's one of those things</i>   

29:48.854 --> 29:50.988
         <i> that we need</i>          
      <i> to get a handle on</i>

         Okay, Poppet.          

29:57.563 --> 29:59.763
          -Sit. Down.           
            - Okay.             

29:59.765 --> 30:02.199
        Ms. Poppet, now,        
     she's nine months old.     

30:02.201 --> 30:03.433
             - Yes.             
            - Right?            

30:03.435 --> 30:05.536

       or novel objects?        

30:12.511 --> 30:15.179
          - No. Nope.           
           - Statues?           

30:15.181 --> 30:18.415
   When you're home with her,   
   what's her normal routine?   

30:18.417 --> 30:20.417
       Is she off leash?        

30:20.419 --> 30:21.819
             - Yes.             
           - Mm-hmm.            

30:21.821 --> 30:24.922
  - Does she sleep in a crate?  
           - Uh, no.            

30:24.924 --> 30:26.089
           - Sleep..            
       - On -- on a bed.        

30:26.091 --> 30:28.025
  Sleeps loose on a tie-down?   

30:28.027 --> 30:29.459
       - No. Just loose.        
        - Does she.. No.        

30:29.461 --> 30:30.527
          That's good.

  <i> Some doggy interest, but..</i>

     <i> she can do the work.</i>      

30:40.039 --> 30:41.438

30:41.440 --> 30:42.873

         and that's up.         

30:53.285 --> 30:56.720
     He's got more energy,      
   and if we can channel that   

30:56.722 --> 31:00.057
    in the right direction,     
 I mean this dog has unlimited  
           potential.           

31:00.059 --> 31:01.491
        Okay, let's go.         

31:01.493 --> 31:03.393

31:15.741 --> 31:17.541

    and go ahead and let go.    

31:17.543 --> 31:20.110
      Go ahead and let go.      
  That's okay, you can let go.

<i>a pretty long way to go for him</i>

33:05.684 --> 33:07.517
     as far as the pulling      
        and the lunging.

     If he sees something..     

33:09.021 --> 33:10.921
    We talked the last time     
        we trained about

    how maybe throwing some     
pieces of paper out ahead of us 

33:13.592 --> 33:15.759
    and kind of getting that    
        as a distraction        

33:15.761 --> 33:17.194

33:17.196 --> 33:19.129

    throwing things around.
