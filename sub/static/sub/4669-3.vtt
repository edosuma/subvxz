00:04.872 --> 00:06.872
Who's that guy with Johnny?

00:06.874 --> 00:09.908
I don't know where he came from.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.843
Just washed up here this morning.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.345
Washed up from where?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.680
No idea.

00:14.682 --> 00:18.283
You know, he's got a funny accent, but...

00:18.285 --> 00:20.986
I don't think it's Russian.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.554
Russian?

00:22.556 --> 00:26.858
Yeah. Didn't you see the
writing on the boat over there?

00:26.860 --> 00:28.320
Well, at least he's not sick.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

01:03.454 --> 01:05.587
Got the hard drives, sir,

01:05.589 --> 01:09.725
and everything we could
find in the situation room.

01:09.727 --> 01:10.959
You ever been here before?

01:10.961 --> 01:12.060
Once, sir.

01:12.062 --> 01:14.329
Sixth grade field trip.

01:14.331 --> 01:16.832
I don't think we made it this far.

01:21.939 --> 01:24.439
Compound is cleared, sir.

01:24.441 --> 01:25.340
No sign of life.

01:25.342 --> 01:28.477
And the bunker? Impenetrable.

01:28.479 --> 01:29.678
And no answer.

01:35.019 --> 01:36.385
Wheels up and outbound.

01:36.387 --> 01:40.689
Will notify on approach. Over.

01:42.292 --> 01:46.628
The lab in Baltimore proved to
be as valuable as we had hoped.

01:46.630 --> 01:49.798
We've been able to get it up
and running in a matter of days.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.569
As of today, more than 10,000
doses have been manufactured

01:54.571 --> 01:57.539
and word has spread up and
down the eastern seaboard.

01:57.541 --> 02:00.175
Every day, trucks and
boats arrive in Baltimore

02:00.177 --> 02:02.711
to pick up new doses and
distribute them to the populace.

02:02.713 --> 02:06.048
We are transporting 12
other doctors and scientists

02:06.050 --> 02:08.015
to the naval base in Norfolk, Virginia,

02:08.018 --> 02:10.786
where we hope to find pilots and planes

02:10.788 --> 02:13.855
and determine whether or not
there are functioning labs

02:13.857 --> 02:16.091
to mass-produce the cure.

02:16.093 --> 02:17.526
I got the hard drives.

02:17.528 --> 02:20.228
Over here. C.O. wants them encrypted ASAP.

02:20.230 --> 02:21.596
How's morale in here?

02:21.598 --> 02:24.332
All hands are holding
up best they can, sir.

02:24.334 --> 02:26.802
I think heading to Norfolk
has everyone feeling hopeful

02:26.804 --> 02:27.936
and anxious.

02:27.938 --> 02:30.205
Your mother's in Kansas, right?

02:30.207 --> 02:32.474
Actually, I managed to convince
her to move to Norfolk last year.

02:32.476 --> 02:36.711
Well, I'll make sure you get out
with one of the first ground teams.

02:36.713 --> 02:38.213
I never did get a chance

02:38.215 --> 02:42.684
to tell you how sorry I
was... am about your wife.

02:42.686 --> 02:43.885
Thank you.

02:43.887 --> 02:45.120
I imagine you've been wondering

02:45.122 --> 02:48.690
how we're gonna handle C.I.C. now.

02:48.692 --> 02:53.128
We'll need a new T.A.O. to
replace Commander Barker.

02:53.130 --> 02:56.064
You up for it?

02:56.066 --> 02:57.966
Absolutely, sir.

02:57.968 --> 02:59.501
How are you feeling physically?

02:59.503 --> 03:02.571
Fine. No side effects whatsoever.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.707
Old rules say you can't even
be at sea after 20 weeks.

03:05.709 --> 03:07.576
I understand.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.845
If you think it'll be a problem...

03:09.847 --> 03:11.446
Kirkland can do the job.

03:11.448 --> 03:12.547
He's ready.

03:12.549 --> 03:14.116
You're more qualified.

03:14.118 --> 03:15.884
That still wins the day.

03:15.886 --> 03:17.252
But I'm going to expect more from you.

03:17.254 --> 03:19.526
I won't let you down, sir.

03:24.528 --> 03:26.995
Thanks, Doc. Feeling better every day.

03:26.997 --> 03:34.402
That is the general idea.

03:34.404 --> 03:37.239
- How's she doing?
- Physically, she's fine.

03:37.241 --> 03:40.408
Getting out of that bay and facing
the crew... that's another matter.

03:40.410 --> 03:42.077
Think I should talk to her?

03:42.079 --> 03:43.245
I don't think she wants to talk to anybody.

03:43.247 --> 03:47.083
- Not even you?
- Not yet.

03:48.085 --> 03:51.954
- Keep trying.
- Yes, sir.

03:53.556 --> 03:55.557
Better hit pay dirt in Norfolk.

03:55.559 --> 03:57.225
Running low on just about everything.

03:57.227 --> 03:59.027
Including sailors.

03:59.029 --> 04:00.962
Can't keep sending Green and Burk and Cruz

04:00.964 --> 04:02.297
out in the field shorthanded.

04:02.399 --> 04:05.133
They'd never say it, but they are fried.

04:05.135 --> 04:06.334
And how about you?

04:06.336 --> 04:09.004
I'm the only one with my family here.

04:09.006 --> 04:11.406
I think I'm doing just fine.

04:11.408 --> 04:13.775
Moment of truth's coming
for a lot of people.

04:13.777 --> 04:15.076
Hey...

04:15.078 --> 04:17.345
You can't trust anything Norris told you.

04:17.346 --> 04:19.947
Deer Park could be completely untouched.

04:19.950 --> 04:22.817
Yeah. It's a "safe" zone.

04:22.819 --> 04:24.753
X.O., commo.

04:24.755 --> 04:26.221
Go for X.O.

04:26.223 --> 04:27.889
We managed the decryptions
from the White House.

04:27.891 --> 04:30.091
At your discretion, sir,

04:30.093 --> 04:32.227
I think you should see this.

04:32.229 --> 04:34.963
Aye, aye. On our way.

04:34.965 --> 04:37.098
According to this map, the
hottest zones are on the coasts.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.300
Makes sense.

04:38.302 --> 04:40.535
They're the most densely populated areas.

04:40.537 --> 04:44.039
- How about Norfolk?
- Zooming in.

04:44.641 --> 04:47.175
70% infection rate.

04:47.177 --> 04:49.711
When is this dated from?

04:49.713 --> 04:51.146
Nine weeks ago.

04:51.148 --> 04:53.114
Do you see any trends based on those days?

04:53.116 --> 04:55.183
At first glance, no.

04:55.185 --> 04:56.284
I'll do a full analysis.

04:56.286 --> 04:57.852
I should be able to extrapolate

04:57.854 --> 05:00.488
from the size of the cities
and the date of impact

05:00.490 --> 05:03.291
how fast it's moving and what
the situation might be now.

05:03.293 --> 05:05.126
We also found a file labeled "SECNAV."

05:05.128 --> 05:07.529
It's a video file dated September 9th.

05:07.531 --> 05:10.131
- We haven't reviewed it yet.
- Play it, please.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.801
- Is this on? Can I start now?
- Yes, sir.

05:12.803 --> 05:15.537
- U.S. Navy is currently on a mission...
- It's the secretary of the Navy.

05:15.539 --> 05:16.838
... to find the materials for a vaccine

05:16.840 --> 05:20.342
to combat the current deadly pandemic.

05:20.344 --> 05:21.976
Now, if y... you're viewing this video,

05:21.978 --> 05:25.246
you are a part of the
new network of facilities

05:25.248 --> 05:27.816
in the United States and
certain foreign nations

05:27.818 --> 05:31.319
which were chosen to produce
and distribute the vaccine

05:31.321 --> 05:34.222
in the event their mission is successful.

05:34.224 --> 05:35.724
In order to protect

05:35.726 --> 05:38.660
the security of the
labs in the new network,

05:38.662 --> 05:41.196
your locations have been kept secret.

05:41.198 --> 05:43.832
However, you'll be able to communicate

05:43.834 --> 05:46.368
with the civilian command, with each other

05:46.370 --> 05:48.570
via secure satellite connection.

05:48.572 --> 05:50.705
The codes for that connection

05:50.707 --> 05:53.508
have been embedded within the
drive that contains this video.

05:53.510 --> 05:57.479
These codes have to be guarded at all cost.

05:57.481 --> 06:01.182
- If... if and when a vaccine arrives...
- No one's decoded this yet?

06:01.184 --> 06:03.718
No, sir. We didn't know those
encryptions existed until just now.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.086
Find me those labs.

06:05.088 --> 06:07.122
- Do it quickly.
- Yes, sir.

06:07.124 --> 06:09.591
- Godspeed.
- How many of you are there?

06:09.593 --> 06:12.327
What kind of power source do you have? And
what's the condition of the surrounding area?

06:12.329 --> 06:13.695
This is the lab in Lisbon.
They're fully operational.

06:13.697 --> 06:15.830
That makes four in the U.S., two in Europe.

06:15.832 --> 06:17.732
Yes, sir.

06:17.734 --> 06:18.800
And how many are dark?

06:18.802 --> 06:21.035
9 international, 13 domestic,

06:21.037 --> 06:22.704
including Norfolk.

06:22.706 --> 06:24.546
Dr. Scott, I have Dr. Hunter in Florida.

06:31.548 --> 06:34.383
That's her mentor from Yale.

06:34.885 --> 06:36.818
Dr. Hunter?

06:38.288 --> 06:39.921
Yes, it's me!

06:39.923 --> 06:41.723
No, it's just...

06:41.725 --> 06:45.293
It's just... hearing your voice.

06:45.295 --> 06:47.695
We've got Salt Lake. That makes five.

06:47.697 --> 06:48.797
Yes, I am alive.

06:48.799 --> 06:51.166
Not only am I alive...

06:51.868 --> 06:54.235
We have a cure.

07:24.230 --> 07:27.632
20 pounds in 20 days!
That's what the X.O. said.

07:27.634 --> 07:29.368
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

07:29.370 --> 07:30.569
Move the feet! Move the feet!

07:30.571 --> 07:32.037
Come on!

07:33.907 --> 07:36.875
Ah, you did good. You did real good.

07:36.877 --> 07:38.677
Oh, man. Oh!

07:38.679 --> 07:42.381
Attaway. Good workout.

07:42.383 --> 07:44.649
How are you, ma'am?

07:44.651 --> 07:46.852
- Amused.
- I'm serious.

07:46.854 --> 07:48.854
I got to get down to regulation weight.

07:48.856 --> 07:52.391
I meant with your trainer.

07:52.393 --> 07:53.596
Mm-hmm.

07:57.598 --> 08:00.199
Well, I haven't seen you since Baltimore.

08:00.601 --> 08:02.534
I heard rumor that you were still with us.

08:02.736 --> 08:04.870
Yeah, well, when I heard
you were headed south,

08:04.872 --> 08:07.472
I figured hitch a ride, go by water.

08:07.474 --> 08:09.074
It's faster, and the food's much better.

08:09.076 --> 08:11.043
That's bullshit.

08:11.345 --> 08:13.879
You care for these people
more than you choose to admit.

08:13.881 --> 08:17.015
Oh, easy, killer. You don't have
to get so lathered up about it.

08:17.017 --> 08:19.818
I'm not lathered.

08:19.820 --> 08:21.420
Just saying.

08:21.422 --> 08:24.691
You're glad I'm back.

08:25.993 --> 08:28.860
Curious to know why you
left in the first place.

08:28.862 --> 08:31.029
Be mildly intrigued to know

08:31.031 --> 08:35.767
where you went off to, who you went off to.

08:35.769 --> 08:40.539
But that, I suppose, would
be a lot of questions.

08:42.241 --> 08:45.115
It's a lot of questions.

08:50.117 --> 08:53.485
She's my daughter.

08:53.487 --> 08:57.355
Last I heard, she was in Jackson.

08:57.357 --> 08:59.224
How old is she?

08:59.226 --> 09:02.628
14. Lives with her mother.

09:03.330 --> 09:07.033
Haven't seen her in three years.

09:07.835 --> 09:09.935
We'll be near Jackson soon enough.

09:09.937 --> 09:14.606
Yeah. I think I'll take
it one day at a time.

09:14.608 --> 09:16.675
Hey, Doc,

09:16.677 --> 09:21.681
I'm ever in the ring,
you can work my corner.

09:23.183 --> 09:25.050
Tex.

09:25.052 --> 09:26.288
Yeah?

09:30.290 --> 09:33.293
Thanks for telling me.

09:35.095 --> 09:36.898
Yeah.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.961
As you know, we will be
landing soon in Norfolk.

09:42.963 --> 09:46.831
We've put out a call over ham
radio and shortwave for pilots.

09:46.833 --> 09:50.235
The hope is, with planes,
pilots, scientists, and doctors,

09:50.237 --> 09:53.171
we can get the labs in America
and possibly even overseas

09:53.173 --> 09:57.375
up and running and getting
real distribution of the cure.

09:57.377 --> 10:00.645
Also be sending out six land
teams with a twofold mission...

10:00.647 --> 10:02.714
find survivors in the general population

10:02.716 --> 10:04.716
and find our families.

10:04.718 --> 10:07.185
Those with loved ones in
Norfolk will be assigned

10:07.187 --> 10:10.555
to the sectors corresponding
to their neighborhoods.

10:10.557 --> 10:12.157
For those who live
elsewhere in the country,

10:12.159 --> 10:15.538
we can only promise your
time will come soon enough.

10:26.540 --> 10:28.643
That's a S.E.A.L.

10:31.645 --> 10:33.721
Signal back.

10:42.723 --> 10:45.490
I see more S.E.A.L.s.

10:45.492 --> 10:48.460
You make out any pilots?

10:48.462 --> 10:50.228
Yes.

10:50.230 --> 10:51.736
Yes, I do.

10:57.738 --> 10:59.075
Man: Secure that line!

11:04.077 --> 11:06.578
Me and my team were
stationed up in Little Creek.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.747
When shit went down, we went inland.

11:08.749 --> 11:10.782
We only made it back here a few weeks ago.

11:10.784 --> 11:14.052
We got 34 military personnel
in town as far as we can tell...

11:14.054 --> 11:17.322
some army, some marines, but mostly Navy.

11:17.324 --> 11:21.126
Our intel says there's a
biosafety level 4 lab on base here.

11:21.128 --> 11:24.062
There was, but the
equipment got moved someplace

11:24.064 --> 11:26.197
and no one here can tell us where.

11:26.199 --> 11:28.667
We've been trying to divide
the city into sectors,

11:28.669 --> 11:30.302
impose a level of control.

11:30.304 --> 11:32.470
We got people holed up in
different safe houses...

11:32.472 --> 11:35.073
school gym, supermarkets,

11:35.075 --> 11:37.075
some of them even running
on diesel generators.

11:37.077 --> 11:38.877
I don't know if we found them all yet,

11:38.879 --> 11:41.079
but we're still in the
process of clearing the city.

11:41.081 --> 11:43.748
My people are about to head out there soon,

11:43.750 --> 11:45.617
try to find their families.

11:45.619 --> 11:48.887
Any information I can
give them ahead of time

11:48.889 --> 11:50.829
will be much appreciated.

11:57.831 --> 12:00.565
Captain says the S.E.A.L.s didn't recognize

12:00.567 --> 12:02.367
any of the names on the list.

12:02.369 --> 12:03.802
Had to figure that, right?

12:03.804 --> 12:06.444
It doesn't mean anything, ma'am.

12:12.446 --> 12:14.913
How you doing?

12:14.915 --> 12:16.915
Nervous. You?

12:16.917 --> 12:18.790
Terrified.

12:25.862 --> 12:30.398
We have labs, we have scientists,

12:30.400 --> 12:32.700
and we have you.

12:32.702 --> 12:37.539
We get this right, with
our ship covering the south

12:37.541 --> 12:39.741
and everybody spreading not just the cure

12:39.743 --> 12:41.810
but the knowledge of how to make it,

12:41.812 --> 12:44.479
we can turn the tide,

12:44.481 --> 12:46.614
not just here,

12:46.616 --> 12:48.416
but in Europe...

12:48.418 --> 12:50.285
and then the world.

12:50.287 --> 12:55.056
We've all waited a long
time for this day to come.

12:55.058 --> 12:57.625
It's here.

12:57.627 --> 13:00.444
All right! Let's saddle up!

13:16.446 --> 13:19.814
... Requesting clearance on runway 1-3.

13:27.057 --> 13:32.260
I can't ever thank you enough.

13:32.262 --> 13:34.214
Just do your part.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.241
Dad did this, Sam.

14:20.243 --> 14:22.510
Dad made this happen.

14:22.512 --> 14:24.329
Damn right he did.

14:45.602 --> 14:47.468
Land teams ready?

14:47.470 --> 14:49.537
As they'll ever be.

14:49.539 --> 14:51.339
Move them out.

14:51.341 --> 14:52.206
Aye.

14:52.208 --> 14:53.341
Mike...

14:53.343 --> 14:54.676
Yeah?

14:54.678 --> 14:58.546
Good luck.

14:58.548 --> 14:59.850
Thanks.

15:14.119 --> 15:17.621
Everyone's looking for their families.

15:17.623 --> 15:20.091
I guess I'm lucky...

15:20.093 --> 15:23.995
I already found mine.

15:23.997 --> 15:26.064
Now she's gone,

15:27.066 --> 15:29.273
and all that's left is what she became.

15:36.275 --> 15:40.111
This situation brings
out the worst in people,

15:40.113 --> 15:42.380
but it also brings out the best.

15:42.382 --> 15:47.818
Part of me wanted to
just stay in Baltimore,

15:47.820 --> 15:52.556
try to help repair that place.

15:52.558 --> 15:54.959
But how could I,

15:54.961 --> 15:57.561
after what she did there?

15:57.563 --> 15:59.864
Your place is here, with your shipmates.

15:59.866 --> 16:01.599
Kara?

16:01.601 --> 16:05.336
My own bunkmate won't even look at me.

16:05.338 --> 16:06.737
After what my mother did to her...

16:06.739 --> 16:08.906
Well, maybe she just doesn't
know how to talk about it,

16:08.908 --> 16:11.242
because I can tell you,
no one here blames you.

16:11.244 --> 16:14.245
I know that you're supposed to say that,

16:14.247 --> 16:15.946
but we walked into that mess

16:15.948 --> 16:17.848
because the captain put his faith in me.

16:17.850 --> 16:24.522
No one's harder on himself
than the captain right now.

16:24.524 --> 16:31.962
It's not just on you, you know.

16:31.964 --> 16:33.631
Once you get your bait,

16:33.633 --> 16:36.333
you're just gonna want to
stick it on the hook right here.

16:36.335 --> 16:38.602
This is, like, a little magnet
that the fish get attracted to

16:38.604 --> 16:40.571
- 'cause it looks like another little fish.
- Oh, cool, cool.

16:40.573 --> 16:42.640
They've already bonded.

16:42.642 --> 16:45.810
Everything moves a lot
faster in the apocalypse.

16:47.213 --> 16:49.046
I suppose that's right.

16:49.048 --> 16:52.416
I hear you're determined
to stay here in Norfolk.

16:52.418 --> 16:54.351
If it's safe.

16:54.353 --> 16:55.886
I think we've had about enough

16:55.888 --> 16:57.188
of water and ships for a while.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.223
Hey, Ashley, give me a turn!

16:59.225 --> 17:00.758
- No, stop, Sam.
- Hey, hey.

17:00.760 --> 17:01.826
Come on, kiddo. Come on. Hey.

17:01.828 --> 17:03.127
Use mine. What do you say?

17:03.129 --> 17:03.561
Some things never change.

17:06.965 --> 17:11.001
How do you think they're holding up?

17:11.002 --> 17:13.270
They don't really talk about it.

17:13.271 --> 17:18.108
The main thing is that
they're with you now.

17:18.111 --> 17:20.010
That's what makes them feel safe.

17:20.012 --> 17:23.684
Oh, hey, Mom, come here.

17:26.586 --> 17:28.819
Cobra Team sweeping sector four.

17:28.821 --> 17:30.387
Copy that, Cobra Team.

17:30.389 --> 17:32.890
Lieutenant Green, we
got three survivors here,

17:32.892 --> 17:34.425
inoculated.

17:34.427 --> 17:36.127
Sending them back to base.

17:36.129 --> 17:38.395
Yeah, copy that. We just
cleared second street.

17:45.204 --> 17:47.738
So, this is where she lives?

17:47.740 --> 17:49.481
Let's do this.

17:57.483 --> 18:05.322
Ma'am, ma'am, let us clear it first.

18:05.324 --> 18:08.125
- His car's gone. This side's clear.

18:08.127 --> 18:14.398
Go for vantage point!

18:14.400 --> 18:17.301
Vulture Team approaching
Deer Park safe zone.

18:17.303 --> 18:19.677
Roger that, Vulture Team.

18:26.679 --> 18:28.946
Let's spread out. Clear the perimeter.

18:28.948 --> 18:30.796
Over here.

18:45.798 --> 18:47.770
We're clear!

18:52.772 --> 18:55.172
It's pretty musty.

18:55.174 --> 19:00.444
It doesn't feel like anyone's
been here for a while.

19:00.446 --> 19:03.354
Looks like she went through all the booze.

19:10.356 --> 19:13.757
She dated it. It's from six weeks ago.

19:13.759 --> 19:15.226
What's it say?

19:15.228 --> 19:17.895
She's at the bowling alley on Hancock?

19:20.097 --> 19:22.299
Well, she was always chasing men around.

19:22.301 --> 19:25.869
Maybe she met someone
hot in the bowling league.

19:25.871 --> 19:28.873
Yes, either that...

19:29.675 --> 19:36.747
... or it's a safe zone.

19:41.887 --> 19:43.187
Here. Eat this.

19:43.189 --> 19:45.927
Then we'll get you a place to sleep.

19:58.638 --> 19:59.870
Excuse me.

19:59.872 --> 20:01.805
I'm looking for a Debbie Foster.

20:01.807 --> 20:03.540
- Debbie...
- Debbie Foster.

20:03.542 --> 20:04.708
Debbie!

20:04.710 --> 20:05.980
Debbie.

20:09.982 --> 20:11.451
Kara?

20:17.690 --> 20:19.089
Mom!

20:19.091 --> 20:21.458
Kara!

20:26.599 --> 20:30.701
How did you get here?!
Where have you been?!

20:30.703 --> 20:34.204
My ship.

20:34.206 --> 20:36.440
We have the cure.

20:36.442 --> 20:38.208
What?

20:38.210 --> 20:40.110
We have the cure, Mom.

20:41.714 --> 20:44.617
The cure.

20:59.923 --> 21:03.825
Hey.

21:03.827 --> 21:06.194
Hey!

21:06.196 --> 21:10.132
Hmm? Hey.

21:10.134 --> 21:13.101
- Why ain't you sick?
- Hmm?

21:13.103 --> 21:16.338
You've been sleeping in that diseased
sleeping bag almost a week now.

21:16.340 --> 21:18.073
- Diseased?
- Yeah, man.

21:18.075 --> 21:20.609
The sleeping bag.

21:20.611 --> 21:23.178
Guy died in it two
hours before you got here

21:23.180 --> 21:25.013
from the virus.

21:25.015 --> 21:26.948
Why ain't you sick?

21:26.950 --> 21:28.817
Well, I suppose

21:28.819 --> 21:33.255
I have to ask you just the same thing.

21:33.257 --> 21:36.525
We haven't had any contact with
anyone from Washington since September.

21:36.527 --> 21:38.760
How are you holding up?

21:38.762 --> 21:41.963
Well, besides the fact that
the whole world is dying,

21:41.965 --> 21:44.666
I haven't left this compound in four months

21:44.668 --> 21:46.068
with the same six people...

21:46.070 --> 21:48.136
Well, it seems like we might be seeing you

21:48.138 --> 21:50.172
sooner than we thought

21:50.174 --> 21:52.307
now that there's no lab here.

21:52.309 --> 21:53.909
Copy that, flier 2.

21:53.911 --> 21:55.444
Salt Lake has landed!

21:55.446 --> 21:57.646
Any word on Phoenix?

21:57.648 --> 22:00.115
Arrived at the lab at 16:46, sir.

22:00.117 --> 22:02.951
Topeka group settled in their lab, sir.
Still waiting on confirmation from Madison.

22:02.953 --> 22:05.187
- And in Europe?
- Radio range is weak, but you can see the beacons.

22:05.189 --> 22:09.124
The thing is, I, um, I seem
to have lost track of Michael.

22:09.126 --> 22:12.628
I don't suppose he's reached out to you?

22:13.230 --> 22:14.663
He said that he might.

22:14.665 --> 22:18.934
I did hear from him, uh,
but that was months ago.

22:18.936 --> 22:20.335
Where was he?

22:20.337 --> 22:21.870
In China.

22:21.872 --> 22:23.705
Madison has reached the lab.

22:25.743 --> 22:27.275
Still in China.

22:27.277 --> 22:30.378
He, uh, he was covering the story there,

22:30.380 --> 22:33.014
which was horrific.

22:33.016 --> 22:35.517
- Was he gonna try to get out?
- I encouraged him to.

22:35.519 --> 22:38.153
Uh, believe me, Rachel, I...

22:38.155 --> 22:40.222
- but I don't know.
- It's getting closer to Lisbon.

22:40.224 --> 22:43.125
We are doing it, commo.
We are making it happen.

22:43.127 --> 22:44.559
Yes, we are, sir.

22:44.561 --> 22:46.261
I'm so sorry, Rachel.

22:46.263 --> 22:49.331
I... I know what he meant to you.

22:49.333 --> 22:53.268
Vulture Team approaching the tents.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.861
No sign of human life so far.

23:19.863 --> 23:22.735
X.O., you'll want to look at this.

23:26.737 --> 23:28.904
Where did you find this?

23:28.906 --> 23:30.205
In the other tent.

23:30.207 --> 23:32.040
Show me.

23:32.042 --> 23:37.445
Right here.

23:37.447 --> 23:39.447
Why did they leave?

23:39.449 --> 23:41.550
Why did they all leave?

23:41.552 --> 23:44.085
The only thing I can think of is,

23:44.087 --> 23:46.702
somebody got exposed and
everybody just took off.

24:12.516 --> 24:16.651
Can you believe I haven't
had a drink in five months?

24:16.653 --> 24:18.386
I saw all your bottles gone.

24:18.388 --> 24:20.055
Thought maybe it went the other way.

24:20.057 --> 24:21.489
Not a drop.

24:21.491 --> 24:24.259
Deb, I just heard. Is it really true?

24:24.261 --> 24:26.061
It's the real thing.

24:26.063 --> 24:28.029
We tested it on ourselves.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.798
This is Peter. I've told him all about you.

24:29.800 --> 24:31.833
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.
- Hi. You too.

24:31.835 --> 24:34.035
You know your mother's the glue
that holds this place together?

24:34.037 --> 24:36.638
Seriously.

24:36.640 --> 24:41.543
Come on, let's get you in line.

24:41.545 --> 24:42.777
Ow!

24:42.779 --> 24:44.479
That is not the woman you described to me.

24:44.481 --> 24:46.681
I know. It's amazing.

24:46.683 --> 24:48.750
I noticed that you
introduced me as your friend.

24:48.752 --> 24:50.752
I didn't exactly know what to call you.

24:50.754 --> 24:54.322
I mean, boyfriend doesn't quite cut it.

24:54.324 --> 24:55.824
What about the baby?

24:55.826 --> 24:58.793
You're not gonna tell her about that?

24:58.795 --> 25:02.330
Can't.

25:02.332 --> 25:05.901
Because she'd ask you to stay?

25:05.903 --> 25:07.235
Because if she asked,

25:07.237 --> 25:14.676
I might have to say yes.

25:14.678 --> 25:17.545
So far, our teams haven't
met any resistance,

25:17.547 --> 25:19.014
and we just got word,

25:19.016 --> 25:24.319
Yates, Heller, and Moralez
found their families.

25:24.321 --> 25:25.720
So, that makes four.

25:25.722 --> 25:27.489
Lieutenant Foster is determined

25:27.491 --> 25:29.124
to remain with the crew on mission,

25:29.126 --> 25:31.826
but the others would like
your permission to stay here

25:31.828 --> 25:33.194
to help with the ground effort.

25:33.196 --> 25:34.396
My permission?

25:34.398 --> 25:35.730
They are still under enlistment.

25:35.732 --> 25:37.666
But they don't want to
leave their families.

25:37.668 --> 25:39.134
No, sir.

25:39.136 --> 25:41.836
And they didn't think it was
feasible to bring them on board.

25:41.838 --> 25:43.538
Like their captain?

25:43.540 --> 25:45.740
We never did clarify

25:45.742 --> 25:49.344
what our position was going to be on that.

25:49.346 --> 25:52.948
That's because I haven't known what to do.

25:56.720 --> 25:59.487
Tell them we thank them for their service

25:59.489 --> 26:01.323
and we'll ring them off
as soon as they're ready,

26:01.325 --> 26:04.259
with full honors.

26:04.261 --> 26:07.462
This is the captain.

26:20.777 --> 26:23.945
Heard you were back.

26:23.947 --> 26:26.054
Yeah, come in, sir.

26:33.056 --> 26:35.094
- I went by my house.
- Mm.

26:41.431 --> 26:44.099
Garage door was open.

26:44.101 --> 26:47.435
Bill's car was gone.

26:47.437 --> 26:49.270
There were...

26:49.272 --> 26:52.540
clothes and suitcases everywhere, so...

26:52.542 --> 26:55.113
I figure maybe they left in a hurry.

26:58.115 --> 27:02.584
I was hoping they fled
somewhere, you know, early on,

27:02.586 --> 27:04.756
but then I went by St. Vincent's to...

27:07.758 --> 27:12.694
check the records.

27:12.696 --> 27:15.463
There were piles of them,

27:15.465 --> 27:17.606
just mounds of paper sitting on a gurney.

27:24.608 --> 27:28.309
It was so surreal,

27:28.311 --> 27:30.648
seeing their names there on that paper.

27:33.650 --> 27:36.751
I mean...

27:36.753 --> 27:40.955
I don't know what I expected...

27:40.957 --> 27:42.857
You know, why...

27:42.859 --> 27:46.194
why I'd be special,

27:46.196 --> 27:49.964
why I'd be spared.

28:22.987 --> 28:24.688
And let me tell you something else...

28:24.690 --> 28:26.956
we are more than just survivors!

28:27.058 --> 28:30.527
We are more than our grief,

28:30.529 --> 28:32.829
we are more than our loss,

28:32.831 --> 28:35.098
and we are more than our pain!

28:35.100 --> 28:37.567
Yeah.

28:37.569 --> 28:39.703
We were spared for a reason.

28:39.705 --> 28:42.672
We were spared because
we were put on this earth

28:42.674 --> 28:44.608
to do something more!

28:47.613 --> 28:50.714
We were spared because we're special...

28:52.317 --> 28:57.154
... because we are the rightful
inheritors of the earth.

28:59.124 --> 29:01.324
This is our destiny...

29:03.462 --> 29:05.362
... because we are the chosen!

29:06.598 --> 29:09.800
We are the chosen!

29:09.802 --> 29:13.170
He says there's others like
him all over the country,

29:13.172 --> 29:16.073
like missionaries.

29:16.075 --> 29:22.379
We are the chosen!

29:22.381 --> 29:25.182
Clear!

29:25.184 --> 29:31.321
Come on, kids.

29:31.323 --> 29:33.423
It's all right.

29:33.425 --> 29:35.492
Now, remember what your father said...

29:35.494 --> 29:38.755
one duffel bag's worth.

30:38.957 --> 30:41.691
They could still be out there.

30:41.693 --> 30:45.495
You were a cop, right, a detective?

30:45.797 --> 30:49.299
So, I should just abandon the mission,

30:49.301 --> 30:51.868
C.O., and the crew?

30:51.870 --> 30:54.271
The captain would understand. Talk to him.

30:54.273 --> 30:57.007
He knew his family was alive,

30:57.009 --> 31:00.510
and he turned away to serve the mission.

31:00.512 --> 31:02.812
Lost his wife because of it.

31:02.814 --> 31:05.282
I can't bring this to him.

31:05.284 --> 31:08.255
You want to stay.

31:12.257 --> 31:15.792
I want a lot of things.

31:15.794 --> 31:18.895
I've been doing a lot of
thinking, about everything.

31:18.897 --> 31:22.766
There's some stuff I didn't tell you,

31:22.768 --> 31:25.802
some things that happened to our
crew while we were out at sea.

31:25.804 --> 31:30.540
There are people out there
who want the cure so badly,

31:30.842 --> 31:33.810
they're willing to do anything
for it, including kill.

31:33.912 --> 31:36.179
As long as Nathan James

31:36.181 --> 31:38.682
is leading the mission to spread the cure,

31:38.684 --> 31:41.918
our ship will be a target.

31:41.920 --> 31:44.688
And it is not a safe place for you.

31:44.690 --> 31:46.856
And I can't put my crew in a position

31:46.858 --> 31:49.192
where my own judgment might be affected

31:49.194 --> 31:51.795
because I'm thinking
about how to protect you

31:51.797 --> 31:53.229
instead of the mission.

31:53.231 --> 31:54.531
So, you're leaving us?

31:54.533 --> 31:57.835
No. Absolutely not.

31:58.637 --> 32:00.804
I'm resigning my commission.

32:00.806 --> 32:03.940
I'm gonna stay here with you.

32:03.942 --> 32:06.142
There's plenty I can do for
the cause here on the ground,

32:06.144 --> 32:09.212
and I'm not gonna leave you again.

32:09.214 --> 32:12.749
It's a promise I made to you,
and I'm not gonna break it.

32:12.751 --> 32:15.185
So, we're staying here in the house.

32:15.187 --> 32:16.419
Well, the gennies are up,

32:16.421 --> 32:18.688
S.E.A.L.s will be here
soon to secure the area,

32:18.690 --> 32:20.690
the whole town's getting cleaned up,

32:20.692 --> 32:23.360
and with the cure now...

32:23.362 --> 32:26.096
It's time to rebuild.

32:26.098 --> 32:28.031
We'll be safe here.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.900
Sounds like your mind is made up.

32:30.902 --> 32:32.068
It is.

32:32.070 --> 32:37.941
Well, I guess we should
start to unpack, then.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.053
Mom would never have
wanted you to come home

32:50.055 --> 32:51.621
before you finished your mission.

32:51.623 --> 32:55.299
- Ashley...
- She wouldn't have wanted you to give up.

33:13.162 --> 33:16.497
Let's hear it for O'Connor
for getting the power back on!

33:20.002 --> 33:22.470
Thank you very much.

33:22.472 --> 33:24.672
Let's go, Romeo. Let's go.

33:24.674 --> 33:26.707
- We got to be going, Mom.
- I know you do.

33:26.709 --> 33:29.577
Just tell me you won't be living in
this bowling alley when I get back.

33:29.579 --> 33:31.879
I think I'll go home.

33:31.881 --> 33:33.647
Might have left a mess there, if I recall.

33:33.649 --> 33:36.319
You did.

33:38.821 --> 33:41.555
I am so proud of you.

33:41.557 --> 33:43.891
You too, Mom.

33:43.893 --> 33:48.195
You too.

33:48.197 --> 33:49.997
Ma'am...

33:49.999 --> 33:53.434
It was very nice to meet you.

33:53.436 --> 33:56.771
You take care of my girl.

33:56.773 --> 33:59.576
And the baby.

34:01.778 --> 34:05.045
You think I don't see?

34:05.047 --> 34:07.982
I'm your mother.

34:07.984 --> 34:09.617
I'll be back in a month,

34:09.619 --> 34:12.051
six weeks tops.

34:47.760 --> 34:49.525
Gonna be puttering around all day?

34:49.527 --> 34:52.163
Just getting the place in order.

34:52.465 --> 34:57.501
Well, I thought you might
just be, uh, procrastinating...

34:57.503 --> 34:59.937
... 'cause you don't know
how to go back to the ship

34:59.939 --> 35:03.676
and tell that crew of
yours that you're quitting.

35:05.678 --> 35:07.244
Do you not realize that they...

35:07.246 --> 35:09.480
that they can't do it without you?

35:09.482 --> 35:12.716
What kind of message are
you gonna send to them,

35:12.718 --> 35:14.885
that you're, uh, George Washington

35:14.887 --> 35:18.288
and you've come back to work on your farm?

35:18.290 --> 35:21.258
You think because you got
a... a lab in Baltimore

35:21.260 --> 35:23.160
and six planes with the cure

35:23.162 --> 35:26.296
that everything's in hand?

35:26.298 --> 35:30.001
The world is in chaos.

35:30.503 --> 35:32.136
There's a lot more to do.

35:32.138 --> 35:34.671
And that crew is trained to
do it, with or without me.

35:34.673 --> 35:37.541
- They need you.
- And they don't?

35:37.543 --> 35:39.843
And what if I don't come back?

35:39.845 --> 35:42.112
I'm gonna make my kids orphans?

35:42.114 --> 35:44.081
You think you're the first soldier

35:44.083 --> 35:46.483
that had trouble leaving
their family behind?

35:46.485 --> 35:48.252
Huh?

35:48.254 --> 35:50.587
During World War II, English naval captains

35:50.589 --> 35:54.224
put their wives and
children in bunkers in London

35:54.226 --> 35:59.930
and went back out to sea to
fight the Nazis for years.

35:59.932 --> 36:04.068
Wives and children, Dad.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.308
The wives were there.

36:11.310 --> 36:13.077
I know you,

36:13.079 --> 36:15.012
and I know you're beating yourself up,

36:15.014 --> 36:18.515
but if you're looking for someone to blame,

36:18.517 --> 36:21.218
blame me.

36:21.220 --> 36:24.254
I should have never
let her go to that town.

36:24.256 --> 36:26.190
So cut the shit

36:26.192 --> 36:28.792
and quit laying this
guilt trip on yourself.

36:28.794 --> 36:32.029
There's no time for it.

36:32.031 --> 36:34.231
Whether you like it or not,

36:34.233 --> 36:36.767
you're Noah and that ship is your ark.

38:32.031 --> 38:35.932
I told your mother we would
not be here without you.

38:35.934 --> 38:38.406
That's still true.

38:42.408 --> 38:45.542
These were given to me by
the captain on the Pinckney

38:45.544 --> 38:47.744
after my tour in Iraq.

38:47.746 --> 38:50.047
Sir, I... I... I... I can't.

38:50.049 --> 38:54.484
Those words are not spoken around here.

38:54.486 --> 38:56.720
I'm promoting you to full lieutenant

38:57.022 --> 39:01.792
for your valor...

39:01.794 --> 39:03.660
... for your loyalty.

39:03.662 --> 39:06.463
Attention to promotion.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.417
Lieutenant Foster.

39:14.119 --> 39:17.721
Raise your right hand and repeat after me.

39:18.223 --> 39:21.057
I, Alisha M. Granderson...

39:21.059 --> 39:22.959
I, Alisha M. Granderson...

39:22.961 --> 39:25.228
- ... do solemnly swear...
... Do solemnly swear...

39:25.230 --> 39:26.830
... that I will support and defend

39:26.832 --> 39:29.199
the constitution of the United States.

39:29.201 --> 39:30.434
... that I will support and defend

39:30.436 --> 39:33.281
the constitution of the United States.

39:44.283 --> 39:49.853
You don't have to say anything.

39:49.855 --> 39:55.158
I'm glad you're still with us, Mike.

39:55.160 --> 39:58.662
You didn't think about staying with them?

39:58.664 --> 40:02.635
It's all I thought about.

40:05.037 --> 40:07.611
You mean I could have had my first command?

40:14.613 --> 40:17.280
There's a vacant house right next to mine.

40:17.282 --> 40:22.152
The S.E.A.L.s will be there,
guarding the area, rebuilding.

40:22.154 --> 40:24.120
My father will be there.

40:24.192 --> 40:26.293
That'll be good for the
children, to be so close.

40:26.295 --> 40:28.028
And, of course, I'll look in on them.

40:28.030 --> 40:29.496
Thank you.

40:29.498 --> 40:31.468
Means a lot.

40:35.550 --> 40:36.816
Be safe.

40:36.818 --> 40:38.341
You too.

41:01.343 --> 41:05.945
Talking about a Navy ship
came home with a cure,

41:05.947 --> 41:09.783
about planes flying across
the country with scientists.

41:09.785 --> 41:11.551
I don't understand.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.253
How are you hearing this?

41:13.255 --> 41:16.222
I told you before, Curtis,
we have people everywhere.

41:16.224 --> 41:19.192
Well, there have been a lot of
rumors floating around like that.

41:19.194 --> 41:20.927
None of them have ever been right.

41:20.929 --> 41:23.897
It's not a rumor.

41:23.899 --> 41:26.901
Who's that?

41:27.903 --> 41:28.968
What did he say?

41:28.970 --> 41:30.570
The ship with a cure...

41:30.572 --> 41:32.939
it is not a rumor.

41:32.941 --> 41:36.042
The only question is, uh,

41:36.044 --> 41:39.045
what are you prepared to do about it?
