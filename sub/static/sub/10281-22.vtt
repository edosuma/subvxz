WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:07.741
Previously on ER:

00:07.775 --> 00:09.043
We belong
together,

00:09.077 --> 00:10.344
Sam, Alex and I.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.246
And Sam knows that.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.114
MAN:
You get two

00:13.147 --> 00:13.781
weekends a month...

00:13.814 --> 00:15.116
That's not enough.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.317
...at the discretion
of the Lopezes.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.386
I get to see my son
at their discretion?

00:18.419 --> 00:19.387
Does that make
any sense to you?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.222
Worst thing
you could do

00:21.255 --> 00:22.823
is violate the judge's
order as we're about to go

00:22.856 --> 00:23.724
into a
custody hearing.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.758
Remember that kid

00:24.792 --> 00:26.060
with high blood pressure?

00:26.094 --> 00:27.295
Call him, tell him
to get his butt

00:27.328 --> 00:28.696
to the clinic sometime
before he's 30.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.598
17-year-old with
pulmonary edema.

00:30.631 --> 00:31.565
Elgin?

00:31.599 --> 00:32.665
There's
no heartbeat.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.701
Not genetic.

00:33.734 --> 00:34.602
It was just bad luck.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.370
( sobbing )

00:39.607 --> 00:42.443
WOMAN:
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:42.476 --> 00:44.178
I haven't
started yet.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.179
Okay,
little pinch.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.514
Ow! Ow! Ow...!

00:46.547 --> 00:47.615
Hey, you put your
schedule request yet?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.417
Yeah, why?

00:49.450 --> 00:50.484
Because Alex this teacher/parent
thing next Monday,

00:50.518 --> 00:52.720
and I'm on all week.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.522
I can swap
Friday.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.789
Find
another nurse.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.325
Can't have one
of our interns

00:57.358 --> 00:59.093
changing bedpans
during their residency.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.494
Yeah, I'm, uh...

01:00.528 --> 01:02.563
I'm still waiting
for my board results.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.132
Well, call the USMLE.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.866
It's multiple choice,
for God's sake.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.335
It's not rocket science.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.669
Okay.
Ow! Ow!

01:08.702 --> 01:10.404
All done.
All done.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.240
( panting )

01:12.273 --> 01:13.641
You are God's gift
to nursing,

01:13.674 --> 01:15.209
you know that?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.744
So, Monday
for Friday?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.179
Yeah, but I thought
you were starting.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.647
Yeah, well, not till
I pass my boards.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.648
I can't quit my day job.

01:20.681 --> 01:21.782
Morning.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.517
Hey, I thought
you had left already.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.153
Orientation doesn't start
till this afternoon.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.687
Figured I'd take care
of a few loose ends.

01:26.720 --> 01:28.722
Return my microscope
to the histology lab,

01:28.756 --> 01:30.458
hand over
supply room keys,

01:30.491 --> 01:31.825
and sell
my textbooks.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.494
You know, this is your
last day of freedom.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.163
Why don't you, uh,
read the paper,

01:35.196 --> 01:36.497
go to the movies,
sleep in?

01:36.530 --> 01:40.234
Right, do as I say,
not as I do.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.702
You find
a place yet?

01:41.735 --> 01:44.305
I'll have a look
while I'm there today.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.539
Um, are you
a doctor?

01:45.573 --> 01:47.275
No, but...

01:47.308 --> 01:48.609
Yes, actually, she's just
not on duty right now.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.344
Uh, I got my hand
slammed in a car door.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.845
I'm supposed to get
another dose of morphine.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.481
Yeah, if you
just wait over there,

01:53.514 --> 01:54.448
I'll take care of that
for you in a minute.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.217
Okay.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.485
You need to start referring
to yourself properly.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.552
You'll never gain
the confidence

01:58.586 --> 01:59.720
of your patients otherwise.

01:59.753 --> 02:00.888
Doesn't feel
quite earned yet.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.290
Fake it till it does.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.657
Where did you match?

02:03.691 --> 02:06.527
University of Michigan,
Ann Arbor.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.197
Well, we'll miss you,
but I hear it's quite nice.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.830
Yeah, AKA--
rich and easy.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.401
Unlike my friend Abby,
who's decided to, uh,

02:13.434 --> 02:15.203
stay at County
and do God's work.

02:15.236 --> 02:16.804
Just like the rest
of us suckers.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.339
Hey, check
this out.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.707
( chuckles )

02:19.740 --> 02:21.675
The doctor
is in.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.245
Five-speed automatic,

02:24.278 --> 02:27.415
340-horsepower,
5.7-liter Hemi,

02:27.448 --> 02:29.917
V-8 with MDS and ESP.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.585
I'm assuming those
are good things.

02:31.619 --> 02:33.754
Man, this is tight.
What'd you drive before?

02:33.787 --> 02:34.955
Nothin'.
I finally got the prize.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.690
So, you won this
in a contest then?

02:36.724 --> 02:38.259
What? No.

02:38.292 --> 02:39.760
Paying for it
out of my own pocket.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.462
Not everybody gets money
from Mom and Pop.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.563
Really.
Really.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.631
Hey, Jing-Mei, take a look.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.399
I'm sorry. I'm late.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.368
So, are you leasing this
or did you buy it?

02:47.401 --> 02:50.604
What do you think?
I'm still a resident, remember?

02:50.638 --> 02:52.306
Hey, get that beast out of here.
This is a hospital, man.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.641
Yeah, which is convenient
for you,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.276
'cause if you ding this baby,
you die.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.811
Hey, is this
the intractable vomiting?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.313
75, endstage colon cancer,

02:59.347 --> 03:00.414
liver mets, fever,
and abdominal pain.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.316
I'd better go.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.717
There's a patient
I want to check on
before I leave.

03:03.751 --> 03:04.818
Okay, give me a call.
Let me know how it goes.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.754
Hold it. Hold it.
BP's 92/64.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.389
Looks pretty jaundiced.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.691
Who's your
oncologist, sir?
Don't have one.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.293
Says that chemo
wasn't working,

03:12.326 --> 03:13.927
so he signed himself out
a few weeks ago.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.929
What about your
primary care doctor?

03:15.963 --> 03:18.299
Fired him. I told him
I wanted to die at home.

03:18.332 --> 03:19.633
Called 911 anyway.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.968
Guess he changed
his mind.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.846 --> 03:35.649
Need any help?
Yeah, I do. Thanks.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.398
Hey.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.865
( sighs )

03:51.899 --> 03:53.434
Thanks.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.502
Now, you stay
in your seat, honey.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.836
Stay in your seat, sweetie.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.805
I-I-I need you to sit down
in your seat, okay?

03:57.838 --> 03:59.039
But, Mommy,
I have to go.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.441
I know, honey.
Just hold on.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.976
Okay? I think
my battery's dead.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.745
( honking )

04:04.778 --> 04:06.747
Come on, lady. Move it!

04:06.780 --> 04:08.482
I think I have cables
in here somewhere.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.351
It's okay. I got it.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.497
( whimpering )

04:23.531 --> 04:25.799
( screaming )

05:25.393 --> 05:27.528
Dr. Carter,
I was sorry to hear...

05:27.561 --> 05:28.796
Thanks.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.063
Wife says to
let us know

05:30.097 --> 05:31.565
if you need her to
bring dinner over.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.401
We will. Okay,
we've got eye pain.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.903
We've got swollen ankle,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.539
excessive coughing,
headache,

05:38.572 --> 05:40.441
gout...
You all right?

05:40.474 --> 05:42.410
Headache. Yeah.
How is Henry?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.445
Haven't seen
him all week.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.746
We're in court today.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.147
Helps to keep busy.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.582
Yeah.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.084
Okay, Chuny, fluroscein,
saline bullets

05:51.118 --> 05:52.586
and a wood's lamp
all in Exam Four.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.087
You got it.

05:54.121 --> 05:55.456
KOVAC:
We need paramedics.

05:55.489 --> 05:56.457
There's a woman wedged

05:56.490 --> 05:57.525
between two cars.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.592
She's awake and alert!

05:58.626 --> 06:00.761
Yeah, State and 14th.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.430
Can you feel me
touching your legs?

06:02.463 --> 06:04.064
WOMAN:
No. No.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.599
Where's Michael?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.067
Are you having
any trouble breathing?

06:07.100 --> 06:08.602
Get me out!

06:08.636 --> 06:10.738
How's the boy?
I-I don't know!

06:10.771 --> 06:12.440
The door's jammed.
I'll be right there.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.807
Michael!

06:13.841 --> 06:15.443
Okay, help is coming.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.810
Just hang in
there, okay?

06:16.844 --> 06:18.612
That guy came barreling
through the cones.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.181
It's crazy.
There's a first aid kit
in my trunk.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.450
Hurry.
I'll get it.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.517
Help me get it open.
Come on.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.755
( grunting )

06:30.023 --> 06:31.492
WOMAN:
Michael!

06:31.525 --> 06:33.694
Hey, hey, where you think
you're going?!

06:33.727 --> 06:35.162
Somebody stop him.
Damn it!

06:35.195 --> 06:37.498
( gagging )

06:37.531 --> 06:39.199
Temp's up. 102.8.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.801
No septic workup,
though, right?

06:40.834 --> 06:42.770
I don't need a workup.
I need ampicillin.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.473
Well, we can't give you anything
until the doctor examines you.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.475
Now, is there anyone
you'd like us to call?

06:47.508 --> 06:48.642
No.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.044
Hi, Richard.
I'm Dr. Chen.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.013
It's Mr. Gould.

06:53.046 --> 06:56.484
Doesn't anybody teach
manners anymore?

06:56.517 --> 06:57.551
Looks like you're

06:57.585 --> 06:58.952
a little jaundiced,
Mr. Gould.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.153
Any advance directives?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.956
Yeah, DNR,
but he wants antibiotics.

07:02.990 --> 07:03.957
Sir...

07:03.991 --> 07:05.526
it's entirely possible

07:05.559 --> 07:07.661
these symptoms are due
to your colon cancer,

07:07.695 --> 07:09.763
and antibiotics
will do nothing
to help that.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.231
I'm not ready.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.201
Well, we can try and figure out
why you have a fever

07:14.234 --> 07:15.869
or we can just treat you
for your pain.

07:15.903 --> 07:18.038
I said I'm not ready!

07:18.071 --> 07:20.608
Okay.

07:20.641 --> 07:23.110
CBC, lytes, liver panel,
blood cultures times two

07:23.143 --> 07:24.845
Zosyn 3.75 piggyback?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.013
Thought you were
a nurse today.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.781
Abby's a nurse
every day.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.050
That's why she's going
to kick ass as a doc.

07:30.083 --> 07:32.953
How'd you score on the boards?
I never heard.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.221
Me, either.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.624
Ah. Pretty close
to the wire, isn't it?

07:36.657 --> 07:39.627
Yeah. Listen, Dr. Chen,
is everything okay?

07:39.660 --> 07:43.797
Um, give Mr. Gould
two liters of saline wide open,

07:43.831 --> 07:46.934
ten of Reglan and four of
morphine once the pressure's up.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.137
Hey.
Hey.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.238
Where you been?
Pardon me.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.706
Um, I took a few days off.

07:52.740 --> 07:54.542
My dad had ten different
doctor appointments.

07:54.575 --> 07:55.776
Nice car, by the way.
Wait a minute.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.077
What happened there?

07:57.110 --> 07:58.546
Nothing, really.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.113
It doesn't look
like nothing.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.250
My-my dad's not sleeping well,
so I'm not sleeping well,

08:03.283 --> 08:05.953
and I forgot to turn on a light
and ran into a door.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.621
Excuse me.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.991
Dr. Pratt.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.627
Damn, how many times
I gotta say good-bye to you?

08:13.661 --> 08:15.563
I wanted to say bye
to Elgin.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.565
He's going home today.
Were you planning on it?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.899
Planning on what?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.067
Seeing him.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.002
Yeah, sure.
Because he asked.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.704
I get the impression
he looks up to you.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.138
Figured he was smarter
than that.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.139
I'd imagine he could use

08:26.173 --> 08:27.240
a positive male figure

08:27.274 --> 08:30.143
in his life right about now.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.946
Yeah, well...
I'm nobody's role model.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.251
WOMAN:
Is he all right?

08:39.285 --> 08:40.320
Don't worry. They are taking
good care of him.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.322
Sir, you need
to clear the area.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.592
I'm a doctor.
If this blade breaks,
you're going to catch metal.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.794
Oh, please...
Get your ass
out of there!

08:46.827 --> 08:48.095
Okay! Just hang on.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.807
Okay, put direct pressure
on anything that bleeds.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.175
Another four of morphine
and one more liter of saline.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.945
Get me the biggest
BP cuff you've got.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.179
How are you doing,
Linda?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.181
Need to call my husband.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.117
We will, but we need
to get you to a hospital first.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.251
... of saline
on the pressure bags.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.886
What's her BP?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.122
108/70. Look, doc,
we have protocols to follow,

09:15.155 --> 09:16.690
and you've already broken
most of 'em.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.058
Pent her up to ten liters of O2.
Let's go!

09:18.091 --> 09:19.627
Sorry, it's just us on the rig.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.795
Oh, please, don't leave me.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.063
You can follow us
in your car if you want.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.865
I'm going with her.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.041
Excuse me.
Looking for a kid named Elgin.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.342
Down at the end
on the left.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.644
Thanks.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.214
Hey, what's up, man?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.249
What's up, Doc?

09:42.282 --> 09:44.017
How you doing?

09:44.051 --> 09:46.219
Good. Just waiting
on my mother
to come get me.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.387
My cousin's driving.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.290
So, what have we learned
from all this?

09:50.323 --> 09:54.061
Five a day, exercise some
and find myself a job

09:54.094 --> 09:56.396
at a vegetable stand
or something, I guess.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.899
Good man.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.903
Well, all right, then.
Take care of yourself.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.271
Yo, Doc, you got an office

10:04.304 --> 10:05.739
somewhere?

10:05.773 --> 10:06.807
Me?

10:08.108 --> 10:09.743
We don't really have a doctor,

10:09.777 --> 10:11.845
so I was thinking
maybe we could come see you.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.819
Yeah, look...
I just work in the ER.

10:18.852 --> 10:21.288
People come in,
I see 'em once, twice tops.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.156
That's it, you know?

10:23.190 --> 10:25.859
Well, maybe we could
hook up something then.

10:27.327 --> 10:30.898
The family clinic can help you
with whatever you need.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.399
Just give 'em a call.

10:32.432 --> 10:35.168
Tell 'em I sent you.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.369
Stay on your meds.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.842
Guess he just got spooked.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.344
Midshaft clavicular
fracture.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.679
That's a dangerous sport.

10:45.713 --> 10:47.180
He's usually steady...

10:47.214 --> 10:49.282
except for that time
he refused a jump.

10:49.316 --> 10:51.018
Well, there's
minimal tenting.

10:51.051 --> 10:53.153
You're very lucky.
This is not going
to need surgery.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.988
Broke my leg
in two places.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.289
Immobilization,
Motrin for pain?

10:56.323 --> 10:58.125
Yep. Month in a sling.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.293
Well, the good news is
that's going to heal on its own.

11:00.327 --> 11:03.330
But I'll miss
the Lamplight Classic.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.967
Get her a follow-up with Ortho
in two to four weeks.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.301
Be right back.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.470
Wish I was that
fearless when I was 15.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.840
Is that fearless
or is that reckless?

11:12.873 --> 11:15.175
She is fearless.
I was reckless.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.244
Hey, look, um, I didn't want
to bug you earlier,

11:17.277 --> 11:20.180
because I'm sure
you've probably heard it
from everybody else, but...

11:20.213 --> 11:22.750
Hey, Taggart, that juvenile
delinquent of yours is MIA.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.817
What?

11:23.851 --> 11:25.418
School called. He's a no-show.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.921
Probably just out lighting fires
and torturing small animals.

11:27.955 --> 11:32.125
Alex playing hooky?
More like his dad is.

11:32.159 --> 11:34.094
Hey, it's me. Pick up.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.163
Come on. Anybody home?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.231
She's got it, uh,
pretty rough with
him, doesn't she?

11:38.265 --> 11:39.867
Which one,
the kid or the ex?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.034
Both.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.170
How are you and Kem doing?

11:48.008 --> 11:49.276
You'll get through this.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.778
Hey, Peaches and Herb,

11:50.811 --> 11:52.312
multiple MVAs
one minute out,

11:52.345 --> 11:53.947
including the woman
nearly cut in half.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.183
Got control of the major
bleeders, but she's tachy.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.219
We need Trauma,
Ortho and Vascular
down here now!

11:59.252 --> 12:01.121
Thought you were
working nights.
I am.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.222
Give her another five
of morphine

12:02.255 --> 12:04.925
and as much O-neg
as you can get.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.393
CARTER:
What have you got?

12:06.426 --> 12:08.295
Seven-year-old male,
unrestrained, tachy at 138.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.364
BP: 102/56, multiple lacs
to scalp and face.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.532
It hurts.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.267
Oh, yeah. I'm
Dr. Carter.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.136
We're going to take
very good care of you, okay?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.504
Who are you?

12:17.537 --> 12:18.872
My name's Abby.
What's your name?

12:20.073 --> 12:21.441
Antwan Coles, 20-year-old driver

12:21.474 --> 12:22.442
of Vehicle Number Three.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.011
Airbag deployed.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.913
Vitals are good, but
he's definitely altered.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.347
Think I smell
a little ETOH.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.916
How you doing, Antwan?

12:28.949 --> 12:31.051
Need to get me out.
No sign of
head trauma.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.053
Pinpoint pupils,
shallow resps, bradycardia.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.287
Push two of Narcan.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.522
Right here?
Yeah, right now,

12:35.555 --> 12:37.090
unless you need some practice
intubating.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.859
You been shooting up,
sniffin'?

12:38.892 --> 12:41.361
No, nothin' like that.
MARQUEZ:
Pulse ox down to 82.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.030
PRATT:
Just give it a second.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.331
( groans )
PRATT:
Come on. Let's go.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.101
You got to back me up, brother.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.203
I'm Dr. Pratt.
You're under suspicion of DUI,

12:50.237 --> 12:51.839
and you sure as hell
ain't my brother.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.208
( alarms beeping )

12:55.242 --> 12:57.945
( soft whimpering )

12:57.978 --> 13:00.948
I can't feel my legs.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.415
Got a flash.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.117
Am I paralyzed?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.485
You received a lot of pain meds,

13:05.518 --> 13:07.087
and you're in shock.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.289
It's affecting
your sensation.
I'm in.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.290
Guidewire's ready.

13:10.323 --> 13:12.025
How's she doing?

13:12.059 --> 13:14.161
Pelvic fracture by exam,
small fluid in Morrison's.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.428
And hypotension.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.097
AP chest and pelvis
are on the way.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.398
Uh, ma'am, I'm Dr. Corday.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.933
I'm a trauma surgeon.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.134
You're bleeding internally,

13:21.168 --> 13:22.369
so we'll have to take you
to the OR.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.237
What about my son?

13:24.271 --> 13:25.272
Uh, I'm sorry.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.506
I don't know.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.943
Michael's in good hands, Linda.

13:29.977 --> 13:30.978
CORDAY:
Were there distal pulses

13:31.011 --> 13:32.312
before the cuffs were placed?

13:32.345 --> 13:33.513
Ask Kovac. He examined
her in the field.

13:33.546 --> 13:34.915
I couldn't tell.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.116
Take down the cuffs,
and she bottoms out.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.985
Better wait
till you're in the OR.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.988
Gram of Ancef, 200 of gent
and DT, if you haven't already.

13:41.021 --> 13:42.122
Why were you in the field?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.290
Good Samaritan.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.392
MALIK
Systolic's 74,
pulse: 130.

13:45.425 --> 13:46.994
CHEN:
Hang another
unit of O neg

13:47.027 --> 13:48.428
and get the
rapid infuser.
You got it.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.997
CORDAY:
Page Ortho down here 911.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.498
Shallow resps,
good femoral pulses.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.532
You still need the infuser?

13:52.565 --> 13:53.600
No. It's all yours.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.535
Tachy at 165,
sats are only 84.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.569
Mommy!

13:56.603 --> 13:58.538
She's right next door, honey.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.539
Mommy!

13:59.572 --> 14:00.607
Okay, I can't get the labs.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.475
He's thrashing around too much.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
Belly's soft. Let's give
him two more of morphine.

14:04.377 --> 14:05.946
Hey, Michael, we're going to try
and make you feel better,

14:05.979 --> 14:07.347
but you got
to settle down, okay?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.481
Daddy, Daddy!

14:08.515 --> 14:09.917
Daddy!

14:11.118 --> 14:12.385
He's on his way.

14:12.419 --> 14:13.987
Let's run in a liter
of warm saline.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.190
Let's get this mask
back on you, buddy.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.391
Michael?
( alarm beeping )

14:18.425 --> 14:20.093
BP's 74/37.
He's bottoming out.

14:20.127 --> 14:21.929
Michael! All right,
we need to intubate.

14:21.929 --> 14:25.098
4.5 uncuffed, two mac blade.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.134
Come on! What are we
waiting for? Let's go!

14:29.069 --> 14:30.938
( Antwan yelling )

14:30.938 --> 14:32.639
Five-centimeter lac
over the deltoid.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.141
Must've hit the doorframe

14:34.174 --> 14:35.408
when he was trying
to leave the scene.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.643
You don't know that.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.311
You don't know nothing
about me, bitch.

14:38.345 --> 14:39.479
Hey, watch
your language.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.547
No attendings in here?

14:40.580 --> 14:41.681
Got their hands full.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.350
Urine tested
positive for
opiates.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.152
Woke up cold
with Narcan.

14:45.185 --> 14:46.486
My guess,
heroin by nose.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.522
Get a CT, check for bleeding
or fractures.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.191
Can I go after that?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.960
Dawg, you caused
an accident.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.094
No, an accident is

14:54.127 --> 14:55.395
when bad things happen
for no reason.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.430
You were high
and ran into people.

14:57.464 --> 14:58.431
Sew him up.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.100
Let the cops sort this out.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.169
( alarms beeping )
Decreased on the left.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.203
This one of the
MVC patients?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.471
Yeah. Mom's next door.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.706
Blunt chest trauma,
hypotensive, and hypoxic

15:06.739 --> 15:07.707
secondary
to a tension pneumo.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.276
How old?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.410
Seven. Let's get an
18-gauge angiocath

15:10.443 --> 15:11.544
and a chest tube tray.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.080
Pulse is 78.
He's bradying down.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.714
That's just gonna
keep getting worse

15:14.747 --> 15:16.316
till we get this compressed air
off his chest.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.617
C-spine, chest,
ab and pelvis?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.219
No, he's not stable yet.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.587
Pulse ox, 84.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.589
Okay, I'll assist
Dr. Carter.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.024
Ten blade to me.
I've got it.

15:24.057 --> 15:24.624
Dr. Weaver?

15:24.657 --> 15:25.993
Ten blade.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.227
You'll be late
for court.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.096
I don't need any help
with a chest tube.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.630
( alarms beeping )
KOVAC:
Good breath sounds.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.532
CHEN:
Systolic's drifting down.
Another liter of NS.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.268
We need
more O neg.
Is my husband here?

15:35.302 --> 15:36.669
Not yet.
Dr. Chen, can you
assist Dr. Carter

15:36.703 --> 15:38.671
with a
pedes case?
Hey, Ortho's here.

15:38.705 --> 15:40.107
We're gonna need bleachers
pretty soon.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.374
And get X ray back
to check line placement.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.475
Why? Is he in trouble?
No, it's just...

15:42.509 --> 15:43.676
I hope this is more interesting

15:43.710 --> 15:45.278
than the Achilles repair
we just did.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.047
Bilateral open femurs,
and open book pelvic fracture.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.048
I'm afraid he's too
emotionally vulnerable.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.482
Not to mention
hypotension,

15:49.516 --> 15:51.084
decreased sensorium and blood in
the pericolic gutters.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.085
What, are you saying
that he can't...?
Do it.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.220
Wow, pretty ugly stuff.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.188
She can hear you.
She is conscious.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.389
Diastolic's dropping.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.091
What happened to
Dr. Chen's face?

15:58.125 --> 15:59.226
If we move now, we might be able
to salvage with a BKA.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.227
Which will be
a non-issue

16:00.260 --> 16:01.228
when she bleeds out

16:01.261 --> 16:02.695
from a massive hepatic lac.

16:02.729 --> 16:05.232
Let's tube her, get her
to the OR for an ex lap.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.167
No. I want to wait
for my husband.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.036
A laparotomy and a BKA.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.303
We're double-teaming.

16:10.337 --> 16:11.304
What's BKA?

16:11.338 --> 16:12.505
What are they saying?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.074
You need surgery.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.075
Oh.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.209
( panting )

16:18.145 --> 16:24.684
( radio plays classical,
country, talk, commercial )

16:28.488 --> 16:32.292
WOMAN:
...And receive placement
assistance anywhere in the USA.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.228
Don't wait any longer to enter
the exciting world of...

16:39.132 --> 16:40.333
( alarms beeping )
Lost the pulse.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.501
Let's PEA.
Epi, 3cc's.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.769
Starting compressions.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.071
Lung's
down again.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.538
CHEN:
Abby, check the thoraseal.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.140
CARTER:
That's not it.
Maybe the tube's kinked.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.208
Or in a
false tract.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.509
No, it's not it.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.179
18-gauge angiocath
and another chest tube tray.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.148
That mediastinum's not widened.
There's no crepitus.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.383
Holding compressions.

16:56.416 --> 16:57.417
V tach.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.751
CHEN:
Charging to 40.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.387
CARTER:
Normal heart,
no chronic

17:00.420 --> 17:01.654
lung disease.
It doesn't make any sense.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.090
Clear.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.425
Still V tach.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.925
Okay, come on.
Needle. Let's go!

17:10.797 --> 17:11.798
( air hissing )

17:15.768 --> 17:17.104
Sinus at 58.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.771
Too slow.
Another round of epi.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.772
Abby, that Gould guy's asking
for you.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.142
Who?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.443
Endstage cancer
with the antibiotics.

17:23.476 --> 17:24.544
Well, did you
tell him I'm busy?

17:24.577 --> 17:25.645
No, I told him
I wasn't going

17:25.678 --> 17:27.180
to deal with
his cranky ass.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.448
Come on. Who's in
and who's out? You in?

17:28.481 --> 17:29.416
I'm in. I'm in.
I'm in.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.750
Come on.
.6 of atropine.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.622
You called?

17:35.655 --> 17:36.723
When am I getting
my own room?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.225
It's noisy in here.
It stinks.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.326
You'll get
your own room

17:39.359 --> 17:40.493
when one
becomes available.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.363
Don't patronize me.
I'm not.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.331
Fever's down.

17:44.364 --> 17:45.732
What do you need?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.534
I dealt with a million
smartalecks just like you.

17:47.567 --> 17:49.636
You think you know everything,
but you know crap.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.338
Okay. Well, then,

17:51.371 --> 17:52.505
I'll be back to
check on you later.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.607
I was a teacher.
Junior high. 37 years.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.144
I bet you were
the kids' favorite.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.378
Weaver's on Line One.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.312
Yeah. Can you
take a message?

17:59.346 --> 18:00.780
She's in her car.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.384
Hi, Dr. Weaver.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.653
Have you called the USMLE
for your board results yet?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.221
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.689
Well, are you going to?

18:09.722 --> 18:10.657
Yeah. Fine.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.391
Fine.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.425
Okay.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.528
I'll be back.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.663
Whatever.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.900
Frank, you have the number
for USMLE around anywhere?

18:20.933 --> 18:22.869
Do I look like 411?

18:22.902 --> 18:25.205
Here.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.240
Let your fingers
do the walking.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.443
Excuse me, nurse.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.445
Uh, my family was
in an accident.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.382
Sinus.

18:35.415 --> 18:36.349
Weak carotid.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.350
It's better than nothing.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.252
500 of NS, another hemocue

18:39.286 --> 18:40.320
and let's get
some warm blankets.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.588
( alarms beeping )

18:41.621 --> 18:43.256
Heart rate's dropping. 48.
Damn it!

18:43.290 --> 18:44.524
Starting
compressions.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.426
All right, epi, come on.
Let's go. Mark time.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.594
Michael?

18:47.627 --> 18:49.496
This the father?
Yeah.

18:49.529 --> 18:50.530
What happened?

18:50.563 --> 18:51.831
Holding
compressions.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.233
He, uh, suffered
severe trauma

18:53.266 --> 18:54.867
to his chest
in the accident.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.204
His lung's collapsed,
and it's compromising his heart.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.405
( alarms beeping )
We lost
the pulse.

18:58.438 --> 18:59.706
Oh, my God.

18:59.739 --> 19:00.873
Okay, let's
let the doctors work.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.209
Oh, you have
to do something.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.410
All right,
pericardiocentesis needle.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.411
He's not
in tamponade.

19:04.444 --> 19:05.612
I know.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.384
Hey!

19:11.418 --> 19:12.419
( knocking ):
Open up.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.224
You're home early.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.930
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

19:23.963 --> 19:25.798
We're watching TV. Why?

19:25.832 --> 19:28.735
Because Alex is supposed to be
in school; that's why.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.403
Dad said it was okay.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.439
Well, it's not exactly his call,
is it?

19:32.472 --> 19:33.873
I'm out of here. Later.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.908
I'll speak
to you soon.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.411
Can I speak with you a minute?

19:40.980 --> 19:42.549
You cannot keep doing this,
Steve.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.816
You can't just pull
him out of school

19:43.850 --> 19:45.418
whenever you
feel like it.

19:45.452 --> 19:46.853
Look, I just wanted
to take the kid and with me...

19:46.886 --> 19:48.788
You're high.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.490
W-What?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.526
You smoked dope in front of him?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.827
No, I went outside.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.264
I took a few rips
when he was watching TV.

19:57.264 --> 19:58.465
And it's no big deal, okay?

19:58.498 --> 19:59.999
Maybe not to you,
but to me it is.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.701
Listen, the only reason why
I kept him out of school

20:01.734 --> 20:03.236
was because I wanted
to take him somewhere.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.938
Where? To an arcade or a movie?

20:05.972 --> 20:07.574
Or your dealer's house?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.509
To my interview, okay?
Interview.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.910
All right?
What?

20:10.943 --> 20:12.979
He got, like, the
coolest job ever.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.947
He's gonna manage this
apartment building,

20:14.981 --> 20:16.783
and they're gonna give
him a place to stay.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.851
Yeah, it's on Upper Dearborn.
It's two-bedroom,

20:18.885 --> 20:21.688
two-bath, fully remodeled.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.590
So now I can live with Dad, too.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.396
BROOKS:
The judge will ask questions

20:29.429 --> 20:30.397
about how you plan
on caring for him

20:30.430 --> 20:32.265
while you're at work.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.366
WEAVER:
Meaning I'm somehow
less of a parent

20:33.400 --> 20:34.734
if I have to
hire a nanny.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.669
The Lopezes
are retired.
They're elderly.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.738
They may not be
alive long enough

20:38.771 --> 20:40.340
for Henry to get
to high school.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.041
And can offer
a larger support system.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.678
So now I'm being
penalized for not
having a big family?

20:45.712 --> 20:48.014
This is a conservative judge.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.883
Her idea of what represents
the best interests of the family

20:50.917 --> 20:54.854
is pretty basic:
two parents-- a man and a woman.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.823
Unless she's planning to
take away the children

20:56.856 --> 20:58.691
of every other single
parent in Chicago

20:58.725 --> 21:00.493
and place them with a
heterosexual couple,

21:00.527 --> 21:01.494
she's a damn hypocrite.

21:01.528 --> 21:02.495
I don't disagree.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.996
It's a myth, you know.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.632
This idea that there's
some perfect setting

21:05.665 --> 21:07.400
that everyone gets raised in.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.402
You need to outline how
you're going to provide a stable

21:09.436 --> 21:10.603
consistent lifestyle.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.810
They brought him.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.346
Sit back down.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.581
If you interact, it
could get volatile,

21:21.614 --> 21:23.716
and that's not going
to help you in court.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.352
He's grown.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.728
( knocking )

21:38.765 --> 21:40.667
You okay in here?

21:40.700 --> 21:41.934
Who was that guy?

21:44.103 --> 21:47.374
He's just some guy who had
a business proposition for me.

21:54.514 --> 21:56.849
Look, Sam, just
so you know,

21:56.883 --> 21:58.951
I wasn't planning
on staying, okay.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.888
It just all kinda
fell into my lap,

22:01.921 --> 22:05.558
which makes me think it
was supposed to happen.

22:05.592 --> 22:08.094
You know, this manager
job is no great shakes,

22:08.127 --> 22:10.897
but, you know, it'll keep
here and, I don't know,

22:10.930 --> 22:13.500
maybe I can go to night
school or something.

22:18.805 --> 22:22.409
You know what Alex said
to me the other day?

22:22.442 --> 22:24.977
What?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.479
He said, "I love you, Dad."

22:33.486 --> 22:35.755
Anyways, um...

22:35.788 --> 22:37.557
I've got a whole
bunch of furniture

22:37.590 --> 22:39.992
with a buddy down in Dallas
and I figure I leave today,

22:40.026 --> 22:44.564
and come back
maybe this weekend.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.098
Hey, maybe when I get back,

22:46.132 --> 22:48.868
you and Alex can
help me paint.

22:58.778 --> 23:00.580
Sam.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.650
Okay.

23:04.584 --> 23:07.019
I'll see you soon.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.024
Hey, buddy.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.493
Hey.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.694
I'm gonna take off.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.829
You, uh, you want
to walk me to my car?

23:16.863 --> 23:19.866
Why can't I just go
to Dallas with you?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.534
Because you got
school, that's why.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.005
( groaning )

23:28.575 --> 23:30.877
( sighing )

23:33.780 --> 23:35.515
LOCKHART:
Mr. Gould, you
have to stay in bed.

23:35.548 --> 23:36.783
Need to use the restroom.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.917
All right, but
you're dehydrated,

23:37.950 --> 23:39.085
and your blood
pressure is low.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.620
Let me get you a bedpan.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.221
Can't a person die
with dignity around here?!

23:42.254 --> 23:43.690
I want a toilet!

23:43.723 --> 23:45.124
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.959
You have to let me help you.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.929
( groaning )

23:52.899 --> 23:54.200
Hold on.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.970
So, what have I got,
a week?

24:01.040 --> 24:02.509
Three days, huh?

24:02.542 --> 24:03.810
( sighs )

24:03.843 --> 24:06.178
Never mind.
Doesn't matter.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.185
What subject?

24:13.219 --> 24:15.688
( panting )

24:15.722 --> 24:17.990
Algebra.

24:18.024 --> 24:21.828
37 years.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.531
Taught over 4,000
13-year-olds.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.067
What the hell for?

24:30.870 --> 24:34.741
Well, I'm sure
you had an impact.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.843
Oh, right.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.146
And at the end, you're alone,
and you got cancer.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.049
I'm here.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.618
Yeah, only because
you're paid to be.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.819
CORDAY:
More laps and suction.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.220
JACY:
BP's down to 78/40.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.857
Ligate the femoral proximal
to the popliteal artery.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.826
I can't control the
damn SMA bleeder.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.562
Okay,
periosteum's shredded up

24:55.562 --> 24:58.598
to the midshaft,
and the perforating
arteries are gone.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.867
Oh, Dr. Kovac, you
came after all.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.201
How is she?

25:02.234 --> 25:05.572
On a scale of one to ten,
probably a four.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.740
Repaired the spleen,
still oozing from the liver.

25:07.774 --> 25:09.742
( alarm beeping )
Maxed out on
dopa and levo.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.110
Make that a three.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.579
Anything I can do?

25:12.612 --> 25:14.113
There's barely
anything I can do.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.883
Perry, start neo
at 100 mikes per minute.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.719
That'll totally screw up
her distal perfusion.

25:19.752 --> 25:20.953
Yes, well, the
brain and heart

25:20.987 --> 25:23.623
outrank the extremities,
don't they?

25:23.656 --> 25:24.724
( drill buzzes )

25:24.757 --> 25:25.892
CHEN:
This is crazy.

25:25.925 --> 25:27.326
MARQUEZ:
Atropine's in.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.995
He's got two
chest tubes.
Hold compressions.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.963
Still pulseless.
There's a huge air leak.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.098
He's got another pneumo.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.099
That's his third.

25:33.132 --> 25:34.701
Resume compressions.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.736
He's been coding off
and on 40 minutes now.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.706
Betadine and a ten blade.
Still PEA.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.340
Another chest tube is
not going to fix it.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.909
His injuries
are too severe.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.844
Carter, somebody needs
to talk to his dad.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.145
Well, come on then, think!
I don't know!

25:46.178 --> 25:47.614
Another epi?
No.

25:47.647 --> 25:48.648
No.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.083
MARQUEZ:
Pulseless.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.887
I'm calling it.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.322
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, okay.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.824
We're pumping air
into the pleural space

25:57.857 --> 25:58.725
faster than the chest tube
can suck it out.

25:58.758 --> 25:59.826
What are you doing?

25:59.859 --> 26:01.260
I'm going to bypass the left,

26:01.293 --> 26:03.095
and gonna put it all
down into the right lung.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.363
He's lacerated

26:04.396 --> 26:05.765
BOTH:
...his left mainstem bronchus.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.233
Resume compressions.
Even if he did,

26:07.266 --> 26:08.735
he's been deprived of oxygen
too long.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.269
Just give it ten seconds.

26:14.073 --> 26:17.076
Okay, hold compressions.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.377
MARQUEZ:
Got a pulse back, 82.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.713
Sats coming up.
Okay, call CT surg,

26:20.747 --> 26:22.381
redline him upstairs.

26:22.414 --> 26:23.983
We saved him.

26:25.017 --> 26:26.385
Mr. Pryor?

26:26.418 --> 26:28.320
We think your son has
a tear in his airway,

26:28.354 --> 26:29.989
and he's going
to need surgery.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.791
But he's going to be okay?

26:31.824 --> 26:33.225
The injury's very serious,

26:33.259 --> 26:36.028
but we hope to be
able to fix it.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.897
Do you know anything
about my wife?

26:37.930 --> 26:39.398
Just that she's in the OR.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.800
I can have someone take you

26:40.833 --> 26:42.101
to the waiting room,
if you'd like.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.736
Can I be with her?

26:43.770 --> 26:46.338
Um, well,
she is being operated on.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.874
Oh, she'd want me there.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.709
Dr. Carter, got a minute?

26:49.742 --> 26:51.043
Uh, no, not really.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.045
It's about Jing-Mei.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.180
Can you give me
a second?

26:54.213 --> 26:56.683
Can you just
have a seat right there?

26:56.716 --> 26:58.250
Yeah, did she
seem okay to you?

26:58.284 --> 27:00.687
No, neither one of us
are having the best day,
okay. Why?

27:00.720 --> 27:02.722
Yeah, well, there's
this bruise on her face.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.857
Yeah, I saw it...
She says it was an accident,
but I don't know.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.059
She seeing somebody?
I don't think so.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.761
She's pretty focused
on her dad these days.

27:08.795 --> 27:12.031
Think it was him?
Maybe. Probably.

27:12.064 --> 27:13.700
Look,
I'd get into it myself,

27:13.700 --> 27:15.067
but things are complicated
between us.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.736
I don't think
that she'll listen to me....

27:16.769 --> 27:19.939
Hey, Pratt,
your DUI homeboy's back from CT.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.073
I'll talk to her.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.241
Thanks.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.381
So, looks like in addition
to being high on "H"

27:29.415 --> 27:30.883
you were also
legally drunk, too.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.084
How you think
your boy out there

27:32.118 --> 27:33.385
is going
to feel about that?

27:33.419 --> 27:34.954
You know what
he says to me?
What?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.388
He said 'cause it's
my third strike

27:36.422 --> 27:39.025
I gonna have to
do 25 to life.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.827
I'm 20 years old, Doc.

27:43.195 --> 27:44.764
You hit a woman and a kid.

27:44.797 --> 27:45.998
Yeah, but life?

27:46.032 --> 27:48.200
What, you think
that's right?

27:48.234 --> 27:49.468
I think it's the law.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.037
Hey.

27:51.070 --> 27:53.072
Lido and a 4-0 vicryl.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.074
I ain't got nothi''
nowhere anyway.

27:55.107 --> 27:57.209
I mean, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

27:57.243 --> 28:00.246
I don't know, go to school,
get a job maybe.

28:00.279 --> 28:01.480
Yeah, right, man.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.115
Who the hell's
gonna hire me?

28:04.984 --> 28:06.953
What, you grow up in Winnetka
or somethin'?

28:06.986 --> 28:09.789
Cabrini-Green, so I don't want
to hear any excuses.

28:09.822 --> 28:13.359
Oh, okay, I guess that makes you
one lucky son of a bitch.

28:13.392 --> 28:15.094
Hey. It ain't about luck.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.428
You know what?

28:16.462 --> 28:19.866
You right.
It ain't about luck.

28:19.899 --> 28:23.069
I guess it's about not
looking back once you're gone.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.872
Doc.

28:42.021 --> 28:42.955
ALEX:
Mom?

28:42.989 --> 28:45.792
When are you making dinner?

28:45.792 --> 28:46.826
Mom?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.360
I'll deal with the clothes.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.798
You put all the stuff that
you want to keep in these.

28:51.798 --> 28:52.932
What?

28:52.965 --> 28:53.900
We're moving.
No!

28:53.933 --> 28:55.835
Come on. Hurry up.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.336
I don't want to go.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.471
You don't exactly
have a choice.

28:59.505 --> 29:00.439
I'm not going!

29:00.472 --> 29:01.841
Yes, you are.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.009
I like it here.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.844
Yeah, so did I.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.179
You're just being a bitch.

29:07.213 --> 29:09.048
What did you call me?

29:09.081 --> 29:10.983
I'm sick of moving just
because you're screwed up.

29:11.017 --> 29:12.451
You know what I'm sick of, Alex?

29:12.484 --> 29:14.954
I'm sick of pretending
that your dad is a good guy.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.088
I'm sick
of keeping my mouth shut

29:16.122 --> 29:17.356
about all the crap
that he's done

29:17.389 --> 29:18.825
and all the things
that he hasn't.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.192
And I'm sick of him
tracking us down

29:20.226 --> 29:22.561
every time he loses a job,
so he can come here

29:22.594 --> 29:24.296
and buy you enough presents
to make you think

29:24.330 --> 29:26.132
he's actually a father
because he's not.

29:26.165 --> 29:28.267
He's a user and a loser,
and I am not gonna let him

29:28.300 --> 29:29.836
turn you into one, too.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.404
Now get your ass in that room
and start packing!

29:40.479 --> 29:41.580
Last one.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.082
Cover with ABD pads.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.118
I'll write post-op notes.

29:46.152 --> 29:48.087
So you saw
the whole thing happen?

29:48.120 --> 29:49.088
Yeah, her car broke down.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.556
I stopped to help.

29:50.589 --> 29:51.991
She's lucky.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.459
Most people would've
kept on driving.

29:53.492 --> 29:56.996
We've got an audience.

29:57.029 --> 29:59.465
Must be the husband.

29:59.498 --> 30:01.133
I'll go talk to him.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.938
How soon before she wakes up?

30:05.972 --> 30:07.073
That's hard to say.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.108
Mr. Pryor?
Yes.

30:09.141 --> 30:11.010
I'm Dr. Kovac.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.012
I was with your wife at
the scene of the accident

30:13.045 --> 30:14.546
and during her surgery.

30:14.580 --> 30:18.584
I'm going to check back
in with you later.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.319
Is she going
to be all right?

30:20.352 --> 30:22.588
She suffered massive
internal injuries,

30:22.621 --> 30:24.390
and she lost a lot of blood.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.992
Oh, God.

30:26.025 --> 30:27.626
But, uh, we were able
to stop the bleeding,

30:27.659 --> 30:31.297
and we're confident that
she's going to pull through.

30:31.330 --> 30:35.534
But, uh, her legs
were severely injured,

30:35.567 --> 30:39.071
and orthopedic surgeons were
not able to salvage them.

30:39.105 --> 30:40.372
What?

30:40.406 --> 30:43.075
We had to amputate.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.912
Wh...? Both legs?

30:45.945 --> 30:47.313
I'm sorry.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.393
LOCKHART:
Yeah, I took it
a couple weeks ago.

31:01.427 --> 31:04.296
Lockhart, Abigail.

31:04.330 --> 31:06.598
I mean, I should've gotten them
by now, right?

31:06.632 --> 31:11.137
Aren't you supposed to send them
to my home address?

31:11.170 --> 31:12.972
You're kidding.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.340
Yeah, I will.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.175
Hey, Frank.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.310
If I received a letter here,
would you tell me?

31:18.344 --> 31:20.012
Hell, no.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.381
If a letter came, it would
be filed alphabetically

31:22.414 --> 31:24.951
in the mail drawer with
everyone else's crap.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.585
As if I didn't
have enough to do.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.120
Excuse me.

31:28.154 --> 31:31.290
I'm looking for a patient,
last name "Gould."

31:34.726 --> 31:36.595
Let's see if he's awake.

31:38.297 --> 31:39.665
Mr. Gould?

31:45.337 --> 31:47.206
Who the hell is that?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.041
It's a former student.

31:51.243 --> 31:52.678
Hey, Mr. Gould.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.213
Ed Minyard?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.182
I had you for algebra.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.417
In both '73 and '74.

32:00.452 --> 32:02.454
Flunked you because
you didn't follow directions

32:02.488 --> 32:03.422
on your final.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.324
Yeah, that'd be me.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.461
What are you doing here?

32:09.495 --> 32:11.697
I teach at Larchmont now.

32:11.730 --> 32:15.101
Math, which is kinda karmic.

32:20.072 --> 32:24.043
Someone called the school,
told us about your situation.

32:35.454 --> 32:37.356
I've reviewed
all the written testimony,

32:37.389 --> 32:39.091
and I have
a few follow-up questions.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.226
Mr. and Mrs. Lopez,

32:40.259 --> 32:41.760
I understand
you're both retired.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.062
Yes, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.163
Can you describe

32:44.196 --> 32:45.664
your physical condition
currently?

32:45.697 --> 32:48.100
My wife and I are both
in good health, Your Honor.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.769
And a statement from your
physician would verify this?

32:50.802 --> 32:52.738
Yes.

32:52.771 --> 32:54.773
Dr. Weaver,
just to clarify.

32:54.806 --> 32:58.244
Both your parents are deceased
and you have no siblings?

32:58.277 --> 33:01.280
That's correct, Your Honor.

33:01.313 --> 33:02.748
I'll take this under submission,

33:02.781 --> 33:05.217
and both parties will be
notified of my decision when...

33:05.251 --> 33:07.519
Your Honor?

33:07.553 --> 33:09.588
I love my son.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.057
Mr. Brooks,

33:11.090 --> 33:12.391
does your client
wish to address the court?

33:12.424 --> 33:13.559
No, Your Honor, she...

33:13.592 --> 33:15.361
And I loved Sandy very much.

33:15.394 --> 33:16.562
Kerry, please.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.197
Together, we decided
to have a baby,

33:18.230 --> 33:21.400
we chose a
sperm donor,
got pregnant,

33:21.433 --> 33:22.634
had a miscarriage,

33:22.668 --> 33:24.403
and together,
we tried it again.

33:24.436 --> 33:25.704
And that time,

33:25.737 --> 33:28.607
thank God, we succeeded,
and we had Henry.

33:31.477 --> 33:32.511
I was there when he was born.

33:32.544 --> 33:34.346
I cut his cord.

33:34.380 --> 33:37.083
We made our way
through every cold, every rash,

33:37.083 --> 33:39.085
every colicky night.

33:39.118 --> 33:44.090
We fed our son
and changed him and bathed him.

33:44.123 --> 33:46.758
We were a family,
whether any city,

33:46.792 --> 33:51.730
or state or country
gives us that recognition.

33:51.763 --> 33:56.268
And we still are.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.404
You'll be notified
of my decision.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.777
Is that it?

34:05.811 --> 34:07.679
Yeah.

34:07.713 --> 34:09.681
All right, I'll
be right back.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.261
FRANK:
ER.

34:22.293 --> 34:23.862
Yeah, can I speak to Dr. Kovac?

34:23.895 --> 34:25.664
Yeah, just a minute.

34:25.697 --> 34:27.132
For you.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.534
Hi, this is Dr. Kovac.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.402
Hey, it's Alex.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.737
Could you come over?

34:31.770 --> 34:33.505
My mom's freaking out.
What are you doing?

34:33.539 --> 34:34.406
Alex?

34:34.440 --> 34:35.507
Hello?

35:15.214 --> 35:18.217
The surgery said
that the lung repair
went very well.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.924
He has my ears.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.795
I was hoping he'd get my eyes.

35:29.828 --> 35:33.199
Everything else was Linda.

35:33.199 --> 35:37.903
That's probably a good thing.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.206
You have kids?

35:40.206 --> 35:42.208
No.

35:42.208 --> 35:43.375
Honey?

35:45.377 --> 35:47.246
I'm here, baby.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.247
So is Michael.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.482
He's right next to you.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.485
What happened?

35:55.987 --> 35:58.290
They had to take
your legs, honey.

35:59.925 --> 36:00.892
But you're going
to be okay.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.394
You're going
to be good.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.668
( stifled sob )

36:13.539 --> 36:16.475
LOCKHART:
"J, K..."

36:16.508 --> 36:17.609
It's empty.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.844
Look under "N."

36:18.877 --> 36:20.346
For Lockhart?

36:20.379 --> 36:21.780
For "Nurses."

36:31.990 --> 36:33.892
HAMMOND:
Doctors' Lounge
is on the third floor,

36:33.925 --> 36:36.562
where I'm sure you'll be
spending little or no time

36:36.595 --> 36:38.564
if you know what's good for you.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.599
My office
is on the second floor,

36:40.632 --> 36:43.335
where hopefully you'll spend
even less time.

36:43.369 --> 36:46.004
And in keeping
with orientation tradition,

36:46.037 --> 36:48.540
some of our departing
third-year residents

36:48.574 --> 36:50.509
will escort you
to a local eatery,

36:50.542 --> 36:53.645
where you will eat, drink,
and pride yourselves

36:53.679 --> 36:57.849
on having matched at one of the
finest hospitals in the country.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.952
So, I'll see you all
tomorrow morning

37:00.986 --> 37:02.854
bright and early.

37:02.888 --> 37:06.925
All right, who
likes Mexican?

37:06.958 --> 37:09.395
Make sure Dr. Goodman sees me
before he leaves.

37:09.428 --> 37:11.930
We need the PPD results
from his file.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.699
Excuse me.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.033
Dr. Rasgotra.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.903
Would it be possible
to speak with you privately?

37:17.936 --> 37:19.338
Transitional internship

37:19.371 --> 37:22.374
leading to
Dermatology, right?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.509
Right this way.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.316
Ha!

37:31.049 --> 37:33.619
( laughing )

37:33.652 --> 37:35.020
Good news?
Yeah!

37:35.053 --> 37:36.322
I passed my boards.

37:36.322 --> 37:37.523
Really?
Yeah.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.360
Congratulations.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.561
Thank you.

37:42.594 --> 37:43.795
( laughing )

37:43.829 --> 37:46.398
Oh, God.

37:46.432 --> 37:48.434
Sorry, I'm just...

37:50.636 --> 37:52.471
You going home?

37:52.504 --> 37:54.673
Yeah.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.808
Give Kem my best.

37:56.842 --> 37:57.943
I will.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.349
Hey, Abby.

38:04.416 --> 38:06.652
I never had a doubt in my mind.

38:22.067 --> 38:24.570
DR. HAMMOND:
So, what can I do for you?

38:24.603 --> 38:29.007
I, uh, I don't know
how to go about this, but, um...

38:29.040 --> 38:32.711
I never actually made
this choice for myself.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.514
I mean, I told my parents
in third grade

38:35.547 --> 38:36.815
that I wanted
to be a doctor,

38:36.848 --> 38:38.684
and ever since then,
it's been assumed.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.051
Suppose it's a good thing

38:40.085 --> 38:42.087
I never said I wanted
to join the circus.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.896
I don't think I can do it.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.399
I've been thinking about it
the whole way here,

38:53.432 --> 38:55.834
and for the last year, actually,
and...

38:55.867 --> 38:56.868
Are you withdrawing

38:56.902 --> 38:58.937
from this residency program?

39:02.508 --> 39:03.975
I'm sorry.

39:08.747 --> 39:12.117
You're really leaving us
in quite a lurch.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.420
What are you going to do, then?

39:14.453 --> 39:15.887
I'm not sure.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.693
You understand
you can't get licensed

39:21.727 --> 39:24.630
without an internship.

39:24.663 --> 39:25.764
I know.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.604
So, you got into MIT after all.

39:32.638 --> 39:34.005
What did you always
used to say?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.174
"Math is the true
universal language..."

39:36.207 --> 39:39.110
"...and love is for suckers."

39:40.712 --> 39:42.080
Mr. Gould,
this is Dorrie.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.181
She's going to
be taking care
of you tonight.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.550
Hi, there.

39:44.583 --> 39:45.784
He's waiting on a bed
in Medicine.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.453
You might want to give them
another call.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.054
GOULD:
Young lady?

39:49.087 --> 39:50.456
Me?

39:50.489 --> 39:52.023
Will you be my nurse
again tomorrow?

39:53.925 --> 39:55.894
No, I won't.

39:55.927 --> 39:56.862
Uh, but I will

39:56.895 --> 39:59.197
be here.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.767
Just ask for Dr. Lockhart.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.974
Alex, come on.
Get in the car, please.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.712
Alex, please.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.080
I'll get you something to eat
on the way.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.214
KOVAC:
Sam!

40:16.247 --> 40:17.516
Luka!

40:17.549 --> 40:18.584
What happened?

40:18.617 --> 40:19.618
What's going on?

40:19.651 --> 40:20.686
What are you doing?

40:20.719 --> 40:23.088
Alex and I have to leave.

40:23.121 --> 40:24.189
What?

40:24.222 --> 40:25.591
It's complicated.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.158
I don't understand.

40:27.192 --> 40:28.159
No one does.

40:28.193 --> 40:29.595
I can't let it happen.

40:29.628 --> 40:32.197
I can't let him
get to my kid.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.232
I'm sorry.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.534
I don't want to go!

40:35.567 --> 40:36.902
Wait. Why are you doing this?

40:38.269 --> 40:39.971
Sam, talk to me! Hey!

40:41.039 --> 40:42.440
Sam!

40:57.088 --> 40:58.757
Hi.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.927
Hi. We're running
low on ibuprofen.

41:03.895 --> 41:07.265
Is that right?

41:07.298 --> 41:09.067
I know it's none
of my business...

41:09.100 --> 41:13.539
You know, I was just
trying to give him a bath.

41:13.539 --> 41:15.874
Was it an accident?

41:15.907 --> 41:18.877
He doesn't know what
he's doing anymore.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.011
Well, did you talk
to anybody about it?

41:20.045 --> 41:21.647
'Cause I think you should.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.649
I'll be okay.

41:23.682 --> 41:25.083
Wait. Hold up. Hold up.

41:25.116 --> 41:28.754
Jing-Mei, look,
call his nurse.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.155
Ask her to stay
an extra couple of hours

41:30.188 --> 41:31.957
so I can take you to dinner
and we can talk.

41:34.025 --> 41:34.993
Jing-Mei,

41:35.026 --> 41:37.295
I'm still your friend,

41:37.328 --> 41:39.565
whether you want to believe that
or not.

41:47.072 --> 41:50.642
Pratt, cops need
you to sign off

41:50.676 --> 41:52.210
on your DUI
ghetto kid.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.912
He's medically
clear, right?

41:53.945 --> 41:55.113
Sutured and good to go.

42:06.892 --> 42:09.060
ELGIN:
She should have been here
by now, man.

42:09.094 --> 42:10.328
What time is it?

42:10.361 --> 42:11.597
Just about 5:00.

42:11.597 --> 42:12.731
What's up, Doc?

42:12.764 --> 42:14.199
He get all
his discharge instructions?

42:14.232 --> 42:15.601
Four hours ago.

42:15.601 --> 42:16.935
Can't get in touch
with my mom.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.069
Phone ain't working
or something.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.204
So, you need a ride?

42:19.237 --> 42:20.639
I got the Chrysler outside.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.073
For real?
Zero to 60

42:22.107 --> 42:22.908
in 5.6 seconds.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.876
Let's go.

42:24.910 --> 42:27.045
( car stereo playing loudly )
Yo, this is one nice ride, man.

42:27.078 --> 42:28.614
This is the best I've been in.

42:28.614 --> 42:30.248
Hey, is your safety belt
fastened?

42:30.281 --> 42:31.617
Like this song right here?

42:31.617 --> 42:33.018
Want to turn this up, bro?

42:33.051 --> 42:34.886
Hands don't even have
to leave the wheel.

42:34.920 --> 42:36.622
Oh, how many speakers you got?

42:36.622 --> 42:38.123
Eight with
a sub-woofer

42:38.156 --> 42:39.791
and 380-watt digital amp.

42:39.825 --> 42:41.159
Yeah, and you're going
to blow them all out,

42:41.192 --> 42:42.894
not to mention
our high-frequency hearing.

42:42.928 --> 42:44.630
ELGIN:
What'd she say?

42:44.663 --> 42:45.764
The lady wants it down a notch.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.098
Is that better?

42:47.132 --> 42:49.300
( car honking behind )
Thank you.

42:49.334 --> 42:51.102
All right, all right,
keep your shirt on.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.309
Hey, jackoff.

42:58.343 --> 42:59.645
Try to pay attention
to the road!

42:59.678 --> 43:00.746
Hey, what's
your problem, man?

43:00.779 --> 43:01.880
Why don't you get out of here?

43:01.913 --> 43:03.281
ELGIN:
Pay attention to this.

43:03.314 --> 43:04.950
Oh, nice.

43:04.983 --> 43:06.084
All right,
we're out of here.

43:08.654 --> 43:09.821
ELGIN:
See you, suckers!

43:09.855 --> 43:11.022
( chuckling )

43:11.056 --> 43:12.758
Feel that Hemi
power, baby.

43:12.791 --> 43:14.025
It's a beautiful thing.

43:14.059 --> 43:15.661
( laughing and whooping )

43:15.694 --> 43:16.995
Do you want to slow down now?

43:17.028 --> 43:17.863
Whoo!

43:17.896 --> 43:19.965
Pratt, slow down.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.902
PRATT:
There, everybody happy now?

43:23.935 --> 43:25.704
Okay, good.

43:29.775 --> 43:30.842
Greg.

43:32.043 --> 43:34.045
( screaming )
Son of a bitch!

43:34.079 --> 43:36.014
He's shooting at us!
Get down!

43:36.047 --> 43:37.182
PRATT:
Come on. Hold on.

43:37.215 --> 43:38.984
We got
to get out of here!

43:42.921 --> 43:45.123
Hold on!

43:45.156 --> 43:46.692
Where is he?

43:49.260 --> 43:50.796
We got to get away from him!

43:55.701 --> 43:56.768
( Jing-Mei screaming )
