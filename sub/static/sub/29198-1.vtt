13:54.208 --> 13:55.584
<i>Oh, hang on a second, folks.</i>

13:55.668 --> 13:57.836
<i>This just in, Ed's boss, Mr. Dupette,</i>

13:57.920 --> 14:00.798
<i>has just issued
the following statement.</i>

14:00.881 --> 14:03.425
<i>"Bighead, you're fired!"</i>

14:03.509 --> 14:05.386
<i>Oh, no,
that sounds serious.</i>

14:06.554 --> 14:08.681
Fired? But I...

14:14.228 --> 14:17.481
Hello. We're here to make room
for the new unemployment office.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.818
You have 24 hours
before we demolish your house.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.820
- Have a nice...
- Gah!

14:22.903 --> 14:24.113
This isn't happening.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.739
Say this isn't happening!

14:25.823 --> 14:27.199
I must be having a nightmare.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.330
Hi, Mr. Bighead.
Long time, no see.

14:37.793 --> 14:40.629
Ed, honey,
I invited Rocko over for lunch.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.464
I hope you don't mind.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.092
Excuse me.
What's wrong with Mr. Bighead?

14:45.175 --> 14:47.219
Oh, just that his life is crumbling

14:47.303 --> 14:49.555
like a dry manure pile in the hot sun

14:49.638 --> 14:51.932
and he sees no hope,
that's all.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.475
I can relate.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.437
I can't watch my favorite
TV show, <i>The Fatheads.</i>

14:56.520 --> 14:58.856
<i>Fatheads?</i>

14:58.939 --> 15:01.025
Yeah, yeah, <i>The Fatheads.</i> That's right.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.819
Your son Ralph made it.
Maybe he can help me out?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.864
Ralphie... My boy...

15:08.574 --> 15:10.743
Even with all the success
of <i>The Fatheads,</i>

15:10.826 --> 15:12.202
I'm just not happy.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.621
I need to get away for a while,

15:13.704 --> 15:15.122
do some real soul-searching,

15:15.205 --> 15:16.415
and find the real me.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.667
I promise I'll write.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.128
Good luck, son.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.881
I packed a fly sandwich for you, dear.

15:26.258 --> 15:30.763
Rocko, honey, Ralph went off
to find himself years ago.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.598
Oh. Excuse me.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.517
I... I have to go check
on the mashed potato bugs.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.062
This is terrible!

15:38.145 --> 15:40.189
No more Ralph means no more <i>Fatheads.</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:42.066
Mr. Bighead, please.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.609
There must be something you can do

15:43.692 --> 15:45.444
to bring them...
I mean, him back.

15:45.527 --> 15:48.572
Your Ralphie needs you.
I need you!

15:48.656 --> 15:50.950
His show is all I have!

15:51.033 --> 15:52.785
Uh, oh, uh...

15:52.868 --> 15:54.328
Uh, sorry.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.246
Rocko, an old cartoon

15:56.330 --> 16:00.042
isn't going to solve
the kinds of problems you have.

16:00.125 --> 16:05.714
Mr. Bighead,
<i>The Fatheads</i> wasn't just a cartoon.

16:05.798 --> 16:11.220
Your son created a cultural icon
that resonated with millions of people!

16:11.303 --> 16:13.055
There's a huge audience out there

16:13.138 --> 16:15.349
clamoring for this show to come back,

16:15.432 --> 16:16.892
and whoever gives it to them

16:16.976 --> 16:20.354
is going to make millions...
no, billions!

16:20.437 --> 16:23.232
Oh, Rocko, you're a genius!

16:23.315 --> 16:27.152
Ralph can make Conglom-O
a new <i>Fatheads </i> special!

16:27.236 --> 16:28.237
It'll be a huge hit.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.824
It'll save my job, my house,
and all of O-Town!

16:31.907 --> 16:34.368
And I can watch my old show again!

16:34.451 --> 16:36.662
They'll never listen to me.
I've just been fired!

16:36.745 --> 16:42.584
But you! You're a fan,
and today's fans have power!

16:42.668 --> 16:43.711
Rocko,

16:43.794 --> 16:45.421
I need you to email-text

16:45.504 --> 16:46.880
that ram-toodle-schmuck

16:46.964 --> 16:48.298
schmeepen-bloop your support

16:48.382 --> 16:51.093
to bring back <i>The Fatheads.</i>

16:51.176 --> 16:53.429
Or we could just go talk to them.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.603
Now, Rocko, Mr. Dupette is very,

17:01.687 --> 17:03.731
let's say, um, particular.

17:07.734 --> 17:11.030
I knew a beaver
was gonna kill me someday.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.656
Grandpa, you're already dead, remember?

17:13.741 --> 17:15.409
I'll tell you when I'm dead!

17:15.492 --> 17:17.286
Why, back in my day,
when you were dead,

17:17.368 --> 17:19.663
you were really dead.
Not this...

17:19.747 --> 17:21.165
Where'd you go, Rocko?

17:21.248 --> 17:22.790
Heffer and I went gluten-free,

17:22.875 --> 17:24.501
I've reunited with my lovely wife.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.669
Hi, Rocko!

17:25.752 --> 17:28.839
I've upgraded, accessorized,
and interfaced my platforms,

17:28.922 --> 17:30.966
plus reset and forgotten
so many passwords,

17:31.050 --> 17:32.593
I think I'm going viral!

17:32.676 --> 17:34.303
We're awaiting test results.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.391
Sorry to interrupt
your little tea party,

17:39.475 --> 17:40.642
but we're only dealing with

17:40.726 --> 17:43.270
the fate of the entire town
right now!

17:43.353 --> 17:46.023
Mr. Bighead and I are gonna
bring back <i>The Fatheads.</i>

17:46.106 --> 17:47.775
- You guys should come along.
- Neat!

17:47.858 --> 17:50.360
Sorry, Heffer promised
we'd look after his grandfather's ghost

17:50.444 --> 17:51.445
for the afternoon.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.821
Filburt!

17:52.905 --> 17:55.449
Grandpa possessed another lawn gnome!

17:56.742 --> 17:59.495
Try and catch me, fatso!

18:02.081 --> 18:04.083
Whoa!

18:05.834 --> 18:07.628
Oh, woe is me!

18:07.711 --> 18:09.004
I'm ruined!

18:09.088 --> 18:11.048
Whatever shall I do?

18:11.131 --> 18:13.592
I've lost everything
but my sweet, sweet,

18:13.675 --> 18:15.135
booger jar.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.098
Um, Mr. Dupette?

18:19.181 --> 18:21.517
What more do you people
want from me?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.768
It's, um...

18:22.851 --> 18:25.479
It's, uh, Ed Bighead, sir.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.064
Ed Bighead?

18:27.147 --> 18:29.900
- Oh!
- What are you doing here?

18:29.983 --> 18:31.902
I thought I just fired you!

18:32.569 --> 18:33.570
Oh, yes, sir.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.239
You did, you did, but I, uh...

18:35.322 --> 18:37.741
We think we can save
your company, Mr. Dupette.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.243
What is that, Bighead?

18:39.701 --> 18:41.203
Is that a mouse?

18:41.286 --> 18:42.579
I'm a wallaby.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.624
Um, Mr. Dupette,
do you think Conglom-O TV

18:45.707 --> 18:46.959
could bring back <i> The Fatheads?</i>

18:47.459 --> 18:49.670
<i>The Fatheads?
The Fatheads?</i>

18:53.423 --> 18:58.554
That show sold millions of toys
and fruit squishies, didn't it?

18:58.637 --> 19:02.349
Yes, I'll bring back <i> The Fatheads.</i>

19:05.018 --> 19:06.854
Why didn't I think of it sooner?

19:06.937 --> 19:09.273
I'll get my people on this
right away!

19:09.356 --> 19:10.941
You... your people?

19:11.024 --> 19:12.651
Uh, well, we were thinking

19:12.734 --> 19:14.945
we could get Mr. Bighead's
son Ralph to make it.

19:15.028 --> 19:17.364
After all, he created <i>The Fatheads.</i>

19:17.447 --> 19:19.700
Too expensive!

19:19.783 --> 19:22.619
Conglom-O is broke!
We might even have to sell

19:22.703 --> 19:24.863
the men's executive washroom toilet
to make this thing.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.210
My people can do it cheap.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.588
They have computers.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.218
Oh, yes, a <i>Fatheads</i> refresh!

19:38.302 --> 19:40.762
- So chic!
- So retro!

19:41.263 --> 19:42.639
We make many a TV show.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.309
Away, riff-raff creature!

19:47.060 --> 19:50.105
Make art is easy with computers.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.940
Oh, so easy!

19:52.024 --> 19:53.609
Bighead, you're re-hired.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.943
If this thing flops...

19:57.237 --> 19:58.363
Oh!

19:58.447 --> 20:00.073
This is my last chance, Rocko.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.575
This cartoon has to be good.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.035
But, Mr. Bighead,

20:03.118 --> 20:04.620
if Ralph doesn't make <i> The Fatheads,</i>

20:04.703 --> 20:06.455
the special will flop.

20:06.538 --> 20:07.538
Flop?

20:07.581 --> 20:09.917
Those guys will ruin <i>The Fatheads!</i>

20:13.921 --> 20:15.339
No!

20:15.422 --> 20:18.926
Okay, Mr. Bighead, Heffer, Filburt and I
will go find Ralph.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.510
You stall the chameleons.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.846
Don't let them release that cartoon!

20:22.930 --> 20:24.014
Little beaver thing!

20:24.097 --> 20:25.474
I'm a wallaby.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.476
Congratulations on your fabulous idea

20:27.559 --> 20:29.519
to save O-Town by bringing back
<i>The Fatheads.</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:33.398
What do you have to say
to your adoring fans?

20:33.482 --> 20:36.526
<i>Fans? I just wanted to see
new </i> Fatheads.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.362
<i>We love Rocko!</i>

20:38.445 --> 20:42.199
We love Rocko!
We love Rocko!

20:42.282 --> 20:43.825
That's him!

20:46.912 --> 20:50.999
I just wanted my show back!

20:52.376 --> 20:54.002
<i>You heard it here first, folks.</i>

20:54.086 --> 20:56.463
<i>O-Town is saved!</i>

20:56.546 --> 20:57.547
<i>Did you get the shot?</i>

20:58.215 --> 20:59.633
Hello, Internets.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.593
It's me, FishSticks96,

21:01.677 --> 21:05.013
with my trusty selfie-o-matic
cranial attachment.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.139
Whoa!

21:06.223 --> 21:08.350
My reality is virtual!

21:08.642 --> 21:10.227
Anyway...

21:10.310 --> 21:11.979
We're going on an epic quest

21:12.062 --> 21:14.314
to find the great
Ralph Bighead.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.191
It's too real!

21:16.275 --> 21:18.777
The details! Whoa!

21:18.860 --> 21:22.781
Subscribe to my channel
to follow our inspirational...

21:22.864 --> 21:25.826
The grotesquerie!
The horror!

21:25.909 --> 21:27.577
I want my mommy!

21:27.661 --> 21:30.205
Spunky! Get away from that Internet thing!

21:30.289 --> 21:31.206
It'll hurt you!

21:32.666 --> 21:34.668
Oh, Rocko, darling!

21:34.751 --> 21:38.422
I have something
to share with you!

21:39.089 --> 21:41.425
It's about my little Ralphie.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.801
Do you know where he went?

21:42.884 --> 21:47.014
Well, my boy sends picture postcards
to his dear mother.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.097
Wow.

21:48.265 --> 21:51.184
China, Egypt, Italy...

21:51.268 --> 21:53.068
Oh, uh, that's not supposed
to be there.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.980
Looks like he's been
all over the world.

21:55.063 --> 21:59.067
And this is the last picture
I have of him.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.237
Oh, bring back
my little tadpole, Rocko.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.949
His mother and father
miss him so very much.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.535
I want to, Mrs. Bighead,

22:08.618 --> 22:10.662
but how are we gonna get
to all these places?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.122
Why don't we just take the rocket?

22:13.206 --> 22:14.708
We found the remote, remember?

22:14.791 --> 22:16.209
Whoops!

22:18.962 --> 22:21.298
Sorry. Too much kale salad.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.760
Ham dog!

22:24.843 --> 22:26.345
Spunky, what is it, boy?

22:26.428 --> 22:28.555
Do you know
how to find Ralph?

22:30.724 --> 22:32.059
<i>Did you just lose</i>

22:32.142 --> 22:33.661
<i>your remote-controlled
flying mechanism?</i>

22:33.685 --> 22:35.353
<i>Well, you're in luck!</i>

22:35.437 --> 22:38.106
<i>Drone-O-Rama!</i>

22:39.024 --> 22:40.817
You strike me as the kind of couple

22:40.901 --> 22:42.503
that knows a quality drone
when you see it.

22:42.527 --> 22:44.446
Let me interest you
in our econo-drone.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.083
Excuse me.
Have you seen this toad?

22:57.834 --> 23:00.045
Can't an elephant bathe in peace?

23:00.128 --> 23:02.798
You nasty, nasty tourists!

23:02.881 --> 23:04.508
Thank you.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.760
- Have you seen him?
- No!

23:06.843 --> 23:07.761
No.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.137
Yes, we've seen him.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.472
No, we haven't!

23:10.555 --> 23:11.640
No, we haven't.

23:11.723 --> 23:12.641
Can I go for a ride?

23:12.724 --> 23:13.642
Yes, you can.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.851
No, he can't!

23:14.935 --> 23:16.103
No, no, you can't.

23:16.186 --> 23:17.729
Nope. Haven't seen him.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.318
No.

23:23.401 --> 23:25.612
No.

23:25.695 --> 23:26.780
No!

23:26.863 --> 23:27.781
<i>Nein.</i>

23:30.242 --> 23:32.160
<i>Nyet.</i>

23:32.244 --> 23:33.453
Iie.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.665
No, absolutely not!

23:43.171 --> 23:44.965
How will we ever find Ralph?

23:45.048 --> 23:47.134
I think we're out of places to look.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.511
I think I'm out of witty banter.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.638
I think we're out of batteries.

23:56.643 --> 23:58.812
Whoo-hoo!

23:58.895 --> 24:04.109
Pillows, culturally ambiguous pillows,
soft and fluffy.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.323
We're okay.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.533
We're okay!

24:11.616 --> 24:13.285
We're okay!

24:21.293 --> 24:23.795
Work harder, you worms!

24:23.879 --> 24:25.505
Faster!

24:28.758 --> 24:30.594
They're making a cartoon?

24:31.178 --> 24:33.513
Shouldn't they be using
pencils or something?

24:33.930 --> 24:34.764
Ha!

24:34.848 --> 24:37.601
Welcome to the 21st century, Bighead!

24:37.684 --> 24:39.769
We have the best computers, <i>ja?</i>

24:40.979 --> 24:44.399
We can make anything
in a passionless and cheap way.

24:53.658 --> 24:57.412
I'm sweating, I'm hot, I'm nauseous.

24:57.495 --> 25:00.498
Oh, now we'll never find Ralph Bighead.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.292
This is just terrible, Heff.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.837
I'll say. I'm not getting
any cell phone reception out here.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.299
Fellas?

25:09.674 --> 25:12.135
Do you see what I see?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.638
Ah!

25:14.721 --> 25:17.933
Fried chicken dancing with pizza slices
around an orange soda fountain?

25:20.685 --> 25:22.604
No, not the mirage.

25:22.687 --> 25:23.980
That thing!

25:25.523 --> 25:27.901
Whoo-hoo!

25:27.984 --> 25:30.153
Ice cream truck!

25:30.237 --> 25:32.072
Would you guys like
an ice-cold pop?

25:32.155 --> 25:33.531
You betcha!

25:33.615 --> 25:34.615
Here you go.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.785
Ooh.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.245
Thank you.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.247
How about you?

25:40.330 --> 25:43.416
Your voice sounds so familiar...

25:43.500 --> 25:45.001
Ralphie!

25:45.085 --> 25:47.712
You're Ralph Bighead!

25:47.796 --> 25:50.215
We've been looking all over
the world for you, Ralph!

25:50.298 --> 25:52.968
- Really?
- Yeah, really, like, sheesh.

25:53.051 --> 25:54.094
Everywhere.

25:54.177 --> 25:55.404
Why would you be looking for me?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.847
Well, you see,
we've been gone for quite some time...

25:57.931 --> 25:59.432
Thank you!

26:00.183 --> 26:02.143
Oh, boy.
See, we were floating

26:02.227 --> 26:03.227
around the universe

26:03.270 --> 26:06.398
for the past 20 years...
Oh, that's good.

26:06.856 --> 26:08.984
Oh, I really needed this.

26:09.067 --> 26:13.405
Um, well, what Filburt's trying to say is
everything's changed so much

26:13.488 --> 26:16.241
that I just need one thing
that used to be here.

26:16.324 --> 26:19.661
Would you bring back <i> The Fatheads,</i>
or at least a special?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.416
Yeah, I don't think so.

26:24.499 --> 26:27.210
Wait! But you're the only one
in the world who could...

26:27.294 --> 26:30.880
Ralph! Ralph!
Ralph, wait!

26:31.548 --> 26:32.549
Why not?

26:32.966 --> 26:35.427
Why would I bring back <i>The Fatheads?</i>

26:35.969 --> 26:38.013
I'm not about cartoons anymore.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.598
Now I only sell <i>Fatheads</i> freezy-pops.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.975
Here, have one.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.894
But this doesn't even
look like Mr. Fathead.

26:44.978 --> 26:48.315
That's because it's Mrs. Fathead.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.317
They're off-model, but they sell.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.072
Get off my truck, Rocko.

26:56.156 --> 26:59.534
If Conglom-O doesn't have a new hit,
then your dad will lose his job,

26:59.617 --> 27:01.077
but most importantly,

27:01.161 --> 27:03.997
your parents will
lose their house!

27:04.372 --> 27:06.416
Their house?

27:08.209 --> 27:11.087
Who's got little tadpole tootsies?

27:13.006 --> 27:16.801
Aww, he damaged my retina.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.219
Aww...

27:22.307 --> 27:23.933
Okay.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.935
Okay?

27:26.019 --> 27:27.520
I'll do it for my parents,

27:27.604 --> 27:29.356
but since the last time
I saw them,

27:29.439 --> 27:31.608
I've... changed.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.032
I'm not Ralph anymore.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.577
I'm Rachel.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.123
Wow, cool!

27:47.207 --> 27:49.084
That is awesome.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.627
Well, what are we waiting for?

27:50.710 --> 27:51.753
Let's go!

28:01.388 --> 28:02.847
Where to?

28:02.931 --> 28:04.349
Conglom-O, Heff!

28:04.432 --> 28:06.518
- Roger.
- Roger?

28:06.601 --> 28:07.841
I thought your name was Rachel.

28:10.647 --> 28:13.358
Away we go!

28:18.446 --> 28:22.158
Hello! I'm talking to you.
Are you listening?

28:22.409 --> 28:24.702
Oh, yes, I am listening.

28:25.328 --> 28:27.956
That is not the right line.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.921
Oh, isn't it funny?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.881
I am laughing so hard right now.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.925
If I had pants,
I would be wetting them.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.094
It stinks.

28:41.469 --> 28:45.432
Bighead, open a window.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.600
Huh? Oh, yes, sir.

28:47.684 --> 28:49.245
<i>♪ She'll be riding six white horses ♪</i>

28:49.269 --> 28:50.854
<i>♪ She'll be riding six white horses ♪</i>

28:50.937 --> 28:53.565
Ah, a little fresh air.
Good idea.

28:58.820 --> 29:04.159
Pillows, culturally ambiguous pillows,
soft and fluffy.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.662
I think I broke my leg.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.372
You don't have a leg.

29:16.212 --> 29:18.381
You will receive our invoice!

29:21.634 --> 29:23.219
No, no, wait a minute.

29:23.303 --> 29:27.390
Bighead, why did you convince me
to hire those idiots?

29:27.474 --> 29:31.603
We obviously need the creator
to do this right!

29:31.686 --> 29:33.354
We sent for him.
He should be here...

29:35.732 --> 29:38.109
We're back!

29:40.111 --> 29:42.322
I like your efficiency, Bighead.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.575
Oh, just in time.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.205
Bighead, nice to meet you.

29:50.288 --> 29:51.289
Cool shoes.

29:51.372 --> 29:53.041
Thanks.

29:53.416 --> 29:55.543
We need you to work your magic.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.796
Your father will fill you in
on all the details.

29:57.879 --> 30:01.341
Ed, you're still in charge.
Make this happen.

30:01.424 --> 30:04.344
Hello, son?

30:05.220 --> 30:06.429
Hi, Dad.

30:07.138 --> 30:09.015
Welp, I'm going on vacation.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.100
This is the most work
I've done in years.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.435
Good luck, Bigheads!

30:12.519 --> 30:13.937
Let me know
when the special's done!

30:14.771 --> 30:17.816
But what... what goes on here?
Where's my son?

30:17.899 --> 30:21.486
I'm not your son. I'm your daughter,
and I'm finally happy.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.326
This is crazy!

30:28.409 --> 30:29.577
No!

30:29.994 --> 30:30.994
Yes.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.123
No.

30:34.207 --> 30:35.959
Yes.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.461
Ah! I can't do this.

30:38.545 --> 30:43.424
I have no daughter!

30:45.093 --> 30:46.469
Dad...

30:46.553 --> 30:48.763
My son made the show.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.682
No son, no show.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.893
There will be no <i>Fatheads</i> special.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.979
I quit!

31:03.152 --> 31:06.364
Rachel, I'm sure he didn't mean
those things.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.324
Uh, Mr. Bighead?

31:08.408 --> 31:09.868
But what about Conglom-O?

31:09.951 --> 31:11.327
Who cares?

31:11.411 --> 31:15.540
Wait! Mr. Bighead,
I need a <i>Fatheads </i> special!

31:15.623 --> 31:17.792
I can't do it!

31:17.876 --> 31:19.002
I can't handle all of this,

31:19.085 --> 31:20.128
this... this... this...

31:20.211 --> 31:21.254
Change?

31:21.337 --> 31:22.839
Hey, can anybody break a five?

31:23.339 --> 31:28.970
All this change stops now!

31:29.762 --> 31:31.681
Wait! Mr. Bighead...

31:31.764 --> 31:35.059
Why don't you go back to the '90s,
where you belong?

31:35.143 --> 31:37.437
Come back, Mr. Bighead!

31:37.520 --> 31:39.314
Rocko, how does it feel

31:39.397 --> 31:42.025
to have single-handedly
brought down Conglom-O

31:42.108 --> 31:45.069
and therefore all of O-Town?

31:45.278 --> 31:47.280
<i>I just wanted my show back.</i>

31:48.489 --> 31:51.659
Down with Rocko!
Down with Rocko!

31:51.743 --> 31:54.495
- Down with Rocko!
- Rocko stole my socks!

31:55.455 --> 31:56.331
There he is!

31:56.414 --> 31:58.708
That's the dog who brought down O-Town!

31:58.791 --> 32:00.460
I'm a wallaby!

32:00.543 --> 32:02.211
Yeah, the nerve of them.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.671
Geez, you're right, Rocko.

32:03.755 --> 32:06.132
You're the wallaby
who brought down O-Town.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.635
Heffer!

32:08.718 --> 32:10.219
Whoops. Sorry.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.013
Well, I'm outta here.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.514
Rachel, wait!

32:13.598 --> 32:15.350
I'm sure your dad
didn't mean all of that.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.226
No, Rocko, I'm done.

32:17.310 --> 32:18.478
I'm not needed here.

32:18.561 --> 32:20.355
I'll go back to selling freezy-pops.

32:20.438 --> 32:21.606
Rachel, wait!

32:26.694 --> 32:28.905
Well, that was sad.

32:28.988 --> 32:32.700
I know! I really wanted
another <i>Fatheads</i> freezy-pop.

32:33.534 --> 32:37.497
Oh, Ed, I wish you'd be more open-minded.

32:37.580 --> 32:40.249
I think it's great
what Rachel has done.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.628
I'm sure she's much more
comfortable with herself.

32:43.836 --> 32:47.382
Plus, I just found these shoes
in her size.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.968
Aren't they adorable?

32:50.051 --> 32:52.136
It's not just that, Bev.
I've lost my job,

32:52.220 --> 32:53.972
I'm losing my house, and now,

32:54.055 --> 32:56.557
Ralph is Rachel?

32:56.641 --> 33:00.353
I'm suffering from
an extreme case of TMC,

33:00.436 --> 33:03.648
Too Much Change!

33:06.651 --> 33:08.236
Is there a window open?

33:10.363 --> 33:11.864
I can't believe this.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.866
Everything is so different,

33:13.950 --> 33:16.369
and now I can't even watch
<i>The Fatheads </i> again.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.789
Aww, cheer up, Rocko.
There's lots of entertainment to be had.

33:19.872 --> 33:21.374
Yeah, Rocko.

33:21.457 --> 33:24.043
Don't underestimate
the hours of fun we can have

33:24.127 --> 33:26.212
making warped selfies!

33:28.423 --> 33:29.424
Pose it! Pose it!

33:29.716 --> 33:31.050
Click it, click it!

33:31.134 --> 33:32.427
Head swap!

33:35.972 --> 33:37.807
Hey, you've gained
a little weight, Filburt.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.308
Hey, shell boy.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.852
Don't forget to spawn.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.770
Technology is fun.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.322
<i>Who's got little tadpole tootsies?</i>

33:53.406 --> 33:55.658
<i>He damaged my retina.</i>

33:55.742 --> 33:57.076
<i>Aww...</i>

34:25.353 --> 34:27.356
Another shipment of mops.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.192
Sicko.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.072
Oh, Spunky.

34:35.197 --> 34:37.033
At least you'll always
stay the same.

34:40.411 --> 34:42.871
Mr. Bighead?
Are you on the roof?

34:43.790 --> 34:45.041
Go away.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.255
Mr. Bighead,

34:52.340 --> 34:54.257
I'm not feeling too good, either.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.719
Oh, Rocko, leave me alone.

34:56.803 --> 34:57.970
I'm a failure.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.765
I feel like
I let everyone down.

35:00.848 --> 35:02.683
You let yourself down, Mr. Bighead.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.268
You can live
without the old job,

35:04.352 --> 35:06.145
and you can live without your house,

35:06.229 --> 35:08.564
but you can't live without
a relationship with your child.

35:11.025 --> 35:12.443
Who are you?

35:12.527 --> 35:16.572
I am the "whinds" of change.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.077
Will you cut that out?

35:21.160 --> 35:23.037
We do not need your wind.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.289
Why are you here,
Mr. Whinds of Change?

35:25.373 --> 35:28.584
I am here to tell you
that embracing change

35:28.668 --> 35:31.796
is the key to happiness.

35:31.879 --> 35:35.424
You must go with
the whinds of change.

35:40.972 --> 35:43.141
Listen, Mr. Blowhard,

35:43.224 --> 35:44.225
I don't like your wind,

35:44.308 --> 35:45.810
and I don't like change,

35:45.893 --> 35:48.104
so why don't you just
take your bogus breeze

35:48.187 --> 35:50.148
and float away?

35:50.231 --> 35:52.692
Yeah, I don't like change
either, Mr. Whinds.

35:52.775 --> 35:54.402
I'm also having a hard time.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.155
You see, I was stuck in space
for 20 years, and...

35:57.238 --> 35:58.406
Silence!

35:59.574 --> 36:02.034
Let me tell you
something else philosophical

36:02.118 --> 36:03.744
from my latest online book.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.997
You see, the nature
of change is...

36:08.916 --> 36:10.585
Excuse me a moment.
I have to take that.

36:10.668 --> 36:11.895
Hello?

36:11.919 --> 36:13.921
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, um, yeah.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.423
Uh, what?

36:15.840 --> 36:17.592
Oh, yes, of course.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.844
Uh, it's for you, Rocko.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.971
Me? Oh, uh...

36:22.054 --> 36:23.764
Uh, hello?

36:23.848 --> 36:26.434
Rocko, where you been?
We've been trying to reach you.

36:26.517 --> 36:29.353
Oh, me? Uh, well,
we're here on the roof,

36:29.437 --> 36:31.522
and the, uh,
whinds of change is here.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.024
She did it, Rocko!

36:33.107 --> 36:35.359
Rachel finished
the <i>Fatheads</i> special!

36:35.443 --> 36:38.446
They're gonna put it on the air
in ten minutes, Rocko.

36:38.529 --> 36:40.531
Come on down to Conglom-O and see it!

36:40.615 --> 36:42.325
Yeah, there's a party, and popcorn,

36:42.408 --> 36:44.535
and they're showing the special
on a huge screen.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.996
Give it back, you fat bovine!

36:47.079 --> 36:48.831
I got more to say, shell-back!

36:48.915 --> 36:51.042
And there's sauce from Bora Bora.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.085
Uh, well, I don't know.

36:53.169 --> 36:54.795
I think Mr. Bighead needs me.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.632
And, Rocko, Rachel is here!

36:58.090 --> 36:59.217
Uh...

36:59.300 --> 37:01.969
We gotta go now, Rock.
We're having technical difficulties.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.471
I am taking the phone!

37:03.554 --> 37:05.514
No, you doesn't!

37:05.598 --> 37:08.392
Give me the phone, Filburt!

37:08.476 --> 37:09.810
So then I said,

37:09.894 --> 37:11.437
"Is that a melon in your pocket,

37:11.520 --> 37:13.606
or just a bad case of..."

37:20.738 --> 37:22.031
Well, that's unfortunate.

37:22.114 --> 37:23.115
Yes.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.868
Rachel finished the <i>Fatheads</i> special,
Mr. Bighead.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.495
They're airing it in a few minutes,

37:27.578 --> 37:29.538
and they're showing it at Conglom-O.

37:29.622 --> 37:32.583
You go, Rocko.
You probably made it happen.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.418
I sure didn't.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.836
You're going with me.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.964
Negatory.

37:38.172 --> 37:39.840
There's no way you'll ever get me

37:39.924 --> 37:42.385
to go down there...

37:42.468 --> 37:44.428
Oh, wait. What... what...
what are you doing?

37:44.512 --> 37:47.556
Sorry, Mr. Bighead,
but you've got a party to attend!

37:47.640 --> 37:49.225
Unhand me!

37:49.308 --> 37:50.685
Let me go! Let me go!

37:51.185 --> 37:52.603
Whinds of change,

37:52.687 --> 37:55.147
blow us to
the premiere party, please!

37:55.231 --> 37:57.483
Well, I still had some more
whords of whisdom,

37:57.566 --> 37:59.110
but okay.

38:03.572 --> 38:06.534
Oh, that wind came out of the wrong end.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.754
Oh, little weenie man! Yoo-hoo!

38:18.838 --> 38:21.757
And that's why I decided
to have that work done, dear.

38:21.841 --> 38:23.634
It's much firmer.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.469
Hey, look, here comes Rocko!

38:28.848 --> 38:30.391
Hey, Rock.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.726
You... you brought potatoes?

38:31.809 --> 38:33.019
It's Mr. Bighead.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.020
Cool!

38:34.103 --> 38:35.730
Get your hands off me!

38:35.813 --> 38:39.233
Take your seats, everyone!

38:39.317 --> 38:42.737
The first <i>Fatheads</i> special
in 20 years

38:42.820 --> 38:45.573
is about to begin.

38:48.200 --> 38:49.994
Yeah, <i>Fatheads!</i>

38:53.748 --> 38:55.249
<i>Hey, everybody.</i>

38:55.333 --> 38:58.377
<i>Who's stuck in
a nostalgia hole, huh?</i>

38:58.461 --> 38:59.754
We are!

39:04.759 --> 39:06.469
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:06.552 --> 39:08.763
meet the Fatheads.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.557
Oh, I love the Fatheads!

39:11.640 --> 39:13.601
It's genius!

39:13.684 --> 39:16.354
<i>Those Fatheads
are oh-so-funny, eh?</i>

39:16.437 --> 39:18.230
<i>But look, what's this?</i>

39:18.314 --> 39:20.649
<i>There appears to be
a new Fathead.</i>

39:20.733 --> 39:23.069
<i>A baby Fathead.</i>

39:23.152 --> 39:25.029
What? A baby Fathead?

39:25.112 --> 39:26.655
There's no baby Fathead.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.657
We want the old Fatheads.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.242
Isn't he a cutie?

39:33.245 --> 39:34.580
Oh!

39:41.170 --> 39:45.341
Oh, look, baby Fathead
is playing with the vacuum!

39:45.424 --> 39:47.468
And he's so cute!

39:47.551 --> 39:49.387
I just want to...

40:09.073 --> 40:10.449
<i>Oh, look,</i>

40:10.533 --> 40:12.010
<i>it appears that there's
a touching moment</i>

40:12.034 --> 40:13.869
<i>with baby Fathead
and his parents.</i>

40:13.953 --> 40:15.037
<i>Let's watch.</i>

40:15.121 --> 40:16.121
Hmm?

40:16.163 --> 40:18.874
<i>Who's the cutest
little baby Fathead?</i>

40:18.958 --> 40:20.584
Coochie-coochie-coo!

40:20.709 --> 40:22.044
Tickle-tickle!

40:22.128 --> 40:25.131
Who's got little tadpole tootsies?

40:27.341 --> 40:31.470
Oh, look, he's damaged my retina.

40:44.483 --> 40:46.527
<i>So long, hosers.</i>

40:50.781 --> 40:52.241
Thank you, thank you.

40:52.324 --> 40:55.077
I just want to thank
all the little people.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.203
Hooray!

40:56.287 --> 40:57.413
Yeah, hooray.

40:57.496 --> 40:59.039
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

40:59.123 --> 41:00.166
Listen to me.

41:00.249 --> 41:01.459
This is not right!

41:01.542 --> 41:03.669
This isn't just new Fatheads,

41:03.752 --> 41:05.629
it's different Fatheads!

41:05.713 --> 41:07.131
We can't like this.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.299
You!

41:08.382 --> 41:09.633
You changed it, Rachel.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.677
You changed <i>The Fatheads!</i>

41:11.760 --> 41:13.429
It's too much change.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.515
Rocko, let me tell you something.

41:16.599 --> 41:18.684
The nature of change is...

41:18.767 --> 41:21.854
Let me take this, Mr. Gassy Cloud-Thing,
whatever you are.

41:21.937 --> 41:24.440
Rocko, we can't live in the past.

41:24.523 --> 41:26.275
We can be grateful for it,

41:26.358 --> 41:27.776
but life isn't permanent,

41:27.860 --> 41:30.321
and if we don't embrace what's now,

41:30.404 --> 41:34.116
we miss out on a lot
of the important stuff.

41:35.075 --> 41:36.202
But...

41:43.334 --> 41:44.585
Okay.

41:44.668 --> 41:46.295
I guess change is okay.

41:46.378 --> 41:48.214
Hooray!

41:48.297 --> 41:49.757
Hooray!

41:49.840 --> 41:52.176
Ooh, let's sing a song about change!

41:52.259 --> 41:54.428
Ah, change is still caca.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.931
Whoa!

42:10.653 --> 42:12.488
It's raining money!

42:12.571 --> 42:16.158
Hey! Conglom-O profits,
free for the taking!

42:16.242 --> 42:18.661
Hup, hup, hup, hup,
hup, hup, hup.

42:18.744 --> 42:21.539
This is the fruit
of capitalist redundancy!

42:22.957 --> 42:24.458
Isn't all of this looting illegal?

42:24.542 --> 42:27.253
What do you mean?
Everybody's happy!

42:27.336 --> 42:29.922
We love this country!

42:30.005 --> 42:31.131
So long!

42:31.215 --> 42:32.591
Bye, Rocko.

42:32.675 --> 42:35.135
Rachel, that was terrific.
Thank you.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.971
Are you going back
to selling <i>Fathead</i> pops?

42:37.346 --> 42:39.640
No, I've got more important things
to do now.

42:39.974 --> 42:41.475
Ed...

42:41.559 --> 42:45.271
This kind of looks like you
first thing in the morning.

42:45.354 --> 42:46.647
Hey...

42:46.730 --> 42:49.525
I resemble that comment.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.863
Oh, Ed.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.240
- So long!
- Good luck.

42:58.158 --> 43:01.453
Well, it's your old boy, FishSticks96,

43:01.537 --> 43:03.747
at the end of my journey.

43:03.831 --> 43:07.459
I hope to someday meet
my five loyal subscribers.

43:07.543 --> 43:08.627
You can!

43:10.671 --> 43:12.423
My family!

43:13.966 --> 43:15.551
I love you!

43:15.634 --> 43:16.634
Neat!

43:17.136 --> 43:18.846
I love you, Grandpa.

43:18.929 --> 43:21.682
Eh, you still smell like sweaty eggs.

43:21.765 --> 43:24.018
Well, what an exciting ending,

43:24.101 --> 43:26.979
but let's talk to the one
who made it all happen,

43:27.062 --> 43:28.772
<i>Really Really Big Man.</i>

43:28.856 --> 43:30.482
<i>Big, how does it feel</i>

43:30.566 --> 43:32.860

on this amazing journey</i>

43:32.943 --> 43:34.486
<i>with your superpowers?</i>

43:34.570 --> 43:36.447
<i>Oh. It's my duty.</i>

43:36.530 --> 43:37.448
<i>But I must say,</i>

43:37.531 --> 43:39.116
<i>my nipples sure are tired.</i>

43:39.199 --> 43:42.703
<i>Understandably so.
Well, there you have it.</i>

43:42.786 --> 43:44.830
<i>From the ruins of Conglom-O
in O-Town,</i>

43:44.913 --> 43:46.707
