01:00.811 --> 01:01.858
Is he asleep yet?

01:01.979 --> 01:04.607
Yeah, I'll go put him to bed.

01:07.943 --> 01:11.038
R. Kelly always does the trick.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.167
I think Evan may be
developing a rash.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.498
You know, when you rub
the Aquaphor on his tush,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.080
you can't just
put it on his cheeks,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.256
you have to rub it
all over the anus, too.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.333
All over the anus, got it.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.050
I think I'm going
to take a bath, okay?

01:27.212 --> 01:29.886
Okay, babe. Go for it.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.537
Not this time.

01:57.367 --> 02:01.372
Okay, come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on. Okay.

02:04.666 --> 02:05.713
Yep.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.801
<i>Oh, yeah, you like
it nasty, don't you?</i>

02:10.881 --> 02:14.385
Oh, I do. I do, I'm sorry.
Guilty as charged.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.603
<i>God, you're so big, it hurts.</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:18.605
I know, I can't help it.

02:18.764 --> 02:19.936
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

02:20.098 --> 02:21.224
<i>Give it to me, daddy. Oh,</i> yeah.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.776
<i>Give it to me, daddy.
Give it to me... Oh, yeah.</i>

02:22.934 --> 02:24.186
Daddy?

02:25.896 --> 02:28.024
Evan! What the...

02:28.190 --> 02:29.567
You're opening doors now?
How did...

02:30.150 --> 02:31.868
I saw a monster. A what?

02:32.027 --> 02:33.745
<i>Stick your
finger in my asshole.</i>

02:33.904 --> 02:34.951
God.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.205
<i>Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah!</i>

02:36.281 --> 02:37.533
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
Fuck, yeah!</i>

02:37.699 --> 02:39.417
<i>I want you to come
all over</i> my...

02:40.577 --> 02:41.578
Oh, my God!

02:45.874 --> 02:47.421
Evan, don't touch that!

02:47.584 --> 02:48.836
Don't...

02:50.587 --> 02:51.759
Daddy, boo-boo.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.761
What the...

02:54.800 --> 02:55.847
Oh, my God.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.553
Okay, don't move. Stay here.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.388
Daddy needs a Band-Aid.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.439
Michelle?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.438
Do you...

03:10.273 --> 03:12.071
Mommy, Daddy, are you okay?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.568
Jim Levenstein.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.988
They still haven't gotten
you an assistant yet, huh?

03:50.147 --> 03:52.775
Kev, I'm sorry, I've been
meaning to call you back.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.614
I've just been... <i>Busy?</i>

03:54.776 --> 03:55.993
I get it.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.655
Look, I'll make
this quick, okay?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.828
The reunion, you in?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.789
Hold on, is that
really happening?

04:02.951 --> 04:04.328
Yeah, man, check your Facebook.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.246
<i>Look, I know they missed
the ten-year by a couple,</i>

04:06.329 --> 04:08.832
<i>but, you know, seems like
people are actually going.</i>

04:09.458 --> 04:11.176
Hey, hon. Hey!

04:11.251 --> 04:13.299
Mmm. Dinner smells great.

04:13.462 --> 04:14.429
Hey, Ellie.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.505
Hey, Jim.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.682
<i>Ooh, Bachelorette finale later.</i>

04:18.341 --> 04:20.810
And don't forget, we still
have to watch <i>Real</i> Housewives.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.017
Yeah, how could I forget?

04:23.180 --> 04:25.148
Hey, Kev, you know who
my favorite housewife is?

04:26.016 --> 04:27.313
<i>You.</i>

04:27.476 --> 04:28.693
Very funny.

04:28.852 --> 04:33.028
Look, I love my wife, but I
need a weekend with the guys.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.239
<i>Come on, we'll go a few days early.
No Stifler this time.</i>

04:36.401 --> 04:39.029
Just you, me, Oz and Finch.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.823
Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

04:40.989 --> 04:43.663
I heard Finch's mom doesn't
even know where he is.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.917
And what about Oz?

04:44.993 --> 04:48.338
I mean, do you really think he would
come with all he has going on?

04:54.711 --> 04:56.884
And we're back
here on Sports View,

04:56.963 --> 05:00.388
with my special guest,
Chad Ochocinco.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.178
Chad, which college
football powerhouse

05:03.345 --> 05:06.098
is gonna have the most players
drafted in this year's draft?

05:06.264 --> 05:09.188
I'm gonna have to go with my
alma mater, the Oregon State.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.571
Come on, man!
What are you smoking, Ocho?

05:12.729 --> 05:14.481
<i>You think I don't know
what I'm talking about?</i>

05:14.564 --> 05:16.737
<i>Do me a favor,
take a look at the tape.</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:19.073
Hey, babe, I'm home!

05:19.236 --> 05:22.581
<i>And that wraps it up for my
special guest, Chad Ochocinco.</i>

05:22.739 --> 05:27.415
<i>This is Chris Ostreicher reminding
you to play on, plava!</i>

05:36.628 --> 05:38.050
Hey, Mia?

05:39.589 --> 05:42.843
Oh, my gosh!
So funny.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.972
Oh, hey, baby!

05:47.556 --> 05:48.603
Hi!

05:48.765 --> 05:50.642
I was just watching
your show a minute ago.

05:50.725 --> 05:51.772
Oh, yeah?

05:51.935 --> 05:53.027
Is everything okay?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.939
You tell me. You're in the
hot tub with another dude.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.449
You are worried about Deshaun?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.776
Aw, that is so cute!

05:59.943 --> 06:02.913
Deshaun's the interior
decorator I told you about.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.539
Hey, Christopher!

06:04.698 --> 06:06.951
Strip down! Come join us.

06:07.576 --> 06:10.420
Maybe next time, Deshaun.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.922
I still don't get why we
need an interior decorator.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.213
Because the place needs to look
perfect for the InStyle shoot.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.972
Babe, trust me.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.509
Remember how you didn't wanna go
on Celebrity Dance Off at first?

06:23.925 --> 06:25.893
Now think of all
the fans you have.

06:26.052 --> 06:30.728
Oh! I almost forgot, Mario Lopez
is having a Memorial Day party.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.726
I told him we're in.

06:32.809 --> 06:36.564
Actually,
I was thinking about going

06:36.646 --> 06:39.069
to my high school
reunion that weekend.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.949
Well, if you're going,
I'm going, too.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.783
Really? Yeah.

06:44.946 --> 06:45.947
All right.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.375
Mia, love, phone call.
It's Rumer.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.293
Oh, shit, let me talk to her.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.751
What's with you jacking
my style, bitch?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.629
Anything I can
get for you, Christopher?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.013
Uh...

07:18.021 --> 07:21.321
Morning, co-workers
and cock-jerkers!

07:21.983 --> 07:23.280
Reggie, give me some love.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.953
Looking good, Stifler.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.781
Ladies, better be working hard,

07:27.864 --> 07:29.286
you weren't hired
for your looks.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.039
Actually, you were.

07:31.368 --> 07:32.665
Not you.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.959
Seriously?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.089
Bob, what are you doing here?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.420
Don't you know
they fired your ass?

07:41.503 --> 07:42.595
What?

07:42.671 --> 07:44.514
I'm just fucking with you.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.799
Or am I?

07:45.882 --> 07:47.600
Hey!

07:49.386 --> 07:51.730
Coffee for the pretty lady?

07:52.389 --> 07:53.686
Sure, thanks.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.816
Let me know if you want
some creamer with that.

08:01.731 --> 08:04.905
Hello, you. How are you?

08:05.068 --> 08:06.593
"Oh, I'm good, Stifmeister,
'cause you know what?

08:06.594 --> 08:08.117
'Cause you're the best."

08:08.196 --> 08:10.494
"Oh, I am the best."
"Yes, you are the..."

08:10.657 --> 08:13.786
"You know, I love you so much that I'm
going to just have some fun down here."

08:13.868 --> 08:15.285
"Oh, yeah, yeah..."

08:15.286 --> 08:17.664
What the hell are you doing?
Jesus Christ!

08:17.914 --> 08:21.043
Shit, sorry, Mr. Duraiswamy
It's... I was just...

08:21.167 --> 08:22.168
Huh?
That's good, it's all clean.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.005
I told you to print out the morning
numbers and put them on my desk,

08:25.088 --> 08:26.635
and you're making
yourself at home?

08:26.756 --> 08:28.554
No, I just thought...
"I just thought..."

08:28.883 --> 08:31.102
I don't pay you to think.
You are a temp.

08:31.553 --> 08:34.432
Yeah, about that. I feel like I'm
being way underutilized here.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.854
Oh, you do, do you?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.934
Thank you for telling
me how you feel.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.729
Do you mind if I
tell you how I feel?

08:41.563 --> 08:44.942
I feel the sooner you realize
that you're the bitch,

08:45.775 --> 08:47.027
not the boss,

08:48.737 --> 08:50.410
the better
off you will be.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.832
Fucker.
What was that?

08:52.991 --> 08:54.117
Nothing!

08:54.200 --> 08:56.419
Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.254
Fucker!

09:05.378 --> 09:09.178
You know, we still haven't
discussed the whole

09:10.341 --> 09:11.558
bathtub incident.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.728
Huh? Oh, that? That's...

09:14.387 --> 09:16.060
Thatâ€œ Don't worry about that.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.980
Well, I mean,
you know, obviously,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.688
I would prefer it
if I was the one

09:22.771 --> 09:25.024
that made you
feel that way, but...

09:25.440 --> 09:26.692
I know how you feel.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.863
Every time I want to shop online
and I start typing "Amazon,"

09:31.029 --> 09:35.535
"amazingcollegesluts.com"
pops up.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.457
Amazing what?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.915
Okay, look, obviously

09:43.625 --> 09:47.596
we need to have
more fun together.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.552
I promise you, this weekend,

09:49.714 --> 09:54.060
there is going to be plenty of
Jim and Michelle time, okay?

10:01.893 --> 10:02.985
Hey!

10:03.061 --> 10:04.108
Hello, sweetheart.

10:04.187 --> 10:05.530
How are you? Oh!

10:05.647 --> 10:07.240
It's so good to see you.
- Hey, Dad.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.113
Hello, son! Come here.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.695
Hi! Hi!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.746
Oh, no!
Look who that is!

10:13.822 --> 10:17.452
Look at this big bruiser!
Oh, my goodness!

10:17.617 --> 10:20.211
He has grown.
- Look at him! Huh?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.794
Someone's got
a little poopy diaper.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.031
Jim?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.542
I can't believe it's you.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.878
You don't remember me, do you?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.379
Uh...
Remember Teletubby Tuesdays?

11:11.671 --> 11:12.923
Kara?

11:13.590 --> 11:14.762
Oh, my God.

11:15.008 --> 11:19.434
What? You're not
a kid any more.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.065
It's been a long time since
I needed a babysitter.

11:22.223 --> 11:26.103
I can't believe how
much you've grown up.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.316
Thanks!

11:27.395 --> 11:29.397
It's actually my 18th
birthday tomorrow.

11:29.564 --> 11:30.565
Eighteen, wow.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.237
You should come to my party.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.318
Oh, uh...

11:33.443 --> 11:35.571
Thank you, no. I...
Yeah, that might be difficult.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.530
Please, I want you
to come so bad.

11:39.782 --> 11:42.126
Hey, Kara! We gotta go.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.454
Okay, relax.

11:45.079 --> 11:47.377
That's AJ. Don't ask.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.542
Hopefully I will
see you tomorrow.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.133
What?
- Who the fuck was that?

11:53.880 --> 11:54.881
Hey, sweetie.

11:54.964 --> 11:55.965
Hey.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.224
Who were you talking to?

11:57.300 --> 11:59.803
That was just
the kid next door.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.629
Hello, my old friends.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.015
I thought about
throwing them out,

12:38.007 --> 12:41.432
but they just have
too much sentimental value.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.641
Yeah.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.266
Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.363
You know, I can remember when
you were just a little guy.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.445
And now you've got
your own little guy.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.608
I know.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.411
And before you know it,
he's gonna be a teenager...

12:58.486 --> 12:59.612
Wow.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.121
And you'll be teaching him
about masturbation

13:03.283 --> 13:05.786
and, you know, all the
do's and all the don'ts

13:05.868 --> 13:07.211
that have to do with
the little guy's weenie.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.288
Right? Okay?

13:08.371 --> 13:11.124
Hopefully, it'll be more of a bratwurst
by the time he's a teenager...

13:11.207 --> 13:12.424
Okay, Dad, I get it.
...but I'm just...

13:12.500 --> 13:14.002
Well, these are things you're
gonna have to deal with.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.758
I understand. It's just,
you know, he's two.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.680
Well, yeah, maybe
you've got time, but..

13:17.755 --> 13:20.725
So, you know, I just, I'd rather
not talk about his penis.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.928
How you doing, Dad? I'm good.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.106
Yeah? What are you doing for fun?
You seen any movies lately?

13:26.723 --> 13:29.897
Well, you know, your mother and
I did go to a lot of movies.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.645
Well...

13:34.397 --> 13:38.243
You know, it has been three
years since she passed, Dad.

13:39.068 --> 13:41.571
There's gotta be someone in
town you can see a movie with.

13:42.405 --> 13:45.033
I have you now.
We'll see a movie tonight, you and me.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.085
Tonight?

13:47.535 --> 13:48.878
Well, I made plans
with the guys,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.671
to meet up with them
tonight at the bar... Oh.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.919
But... Yeah, yeah...

13:51.998 --> 13:54.672
But I don't need to do that.
I can do that tomorrow.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.425
No. No, no, no, no.
This is why you're in town, isn't it?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.840
No, no, no.
You go. I'll be fine.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.141
I was just planning
on staying in tonight

14:02.216 --> 14:03.934
and, you know,
doing a little reading.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.433
Oh, not this. No. No.

14:11.184 --> 14:15.610
Although, I do remember reading
a very interesting article

14:15.772 --> 14:18.616
on something Brazilian.

14:18.775 --> 14:22.200
Boy, these pages are all
stuck together here.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.911
I got it.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.625
Kev.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.589
Hey!

14:38.378 --> 14:40.801
What's up, man? Jim.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.136
Hey, guys!

14:42.256 --> 14:43.758
Oz. There he is.

14:43.841 --> 14:44.888
You made it.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.846
Hey, I missed your wedding,
I wasn't gonna miss this.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.643
Hey, buddy. What's up, pal?

14:49.806 --> 14:51.479
Good to see you. Yeah, man.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.143
Hey, Kev!

14:53.226 --> 14:54.523
Looking good, look at you!

14:54.602 --> 14:56.400
Oh, stop it. Come on.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.163
Gentlemen.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.291
Finch? Finch!

15:16.374 --> 15:17.421
Oh, my God!
It great to see you, James.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.467
Changed at all, Jim.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.544
Good to see you, pal.

15:19.627 --> 15:20.674
I didn't think you
were gonna make it.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.754
Finch, how are you, man?

15:22.130 --> 15:26.761
So, after my troubles in Beijing,
I just moved to Dubai,

15:26.926 --> 15:30.100
and then I got all caught up in the
world of underground baccarat.

15:30.263 --> 15:33.563
Spent the rest of '09 living
with this African tribe.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.815
Oh, they made me
an honorary tribesman.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
Oh.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.359
Whoa, that looks like it hurt.

15:39.522 --> 15:41.524
It looks like that
because it did hurt, Kevin.

15:41.691 --> 15:45.696
Since then, I've just been
biking through South America.

15:45.862 --> 15:48.786
So, basically, you are the most
interesting man in the world.

15:48.865 --> 15:51.038
Yeah. Let me guess,

15:51.284 --> 15:53.662
you guys are here
for the reunion, huh?

15:53.828 --> 15:55.830
You got it. Class of '99.

15:55.997 --> 15:57.544
Haven%I seen you before?

15:57.707 --> 15:59.801
Yeah, I'm on TV.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.337
No, not you. You.

16:03.963 --> 16:07.888
'Cause, your face,
you're just so familiar.

16:08.050 --> 16:10.644
Yeah! Yeah, this is you, right?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.643
Oh! Man, Nadia!

16:12.722 --> 16:15.191
<i>More, more, you bad boy!</i>

16:15.349 --> 16:17.477
I swear I had these all taken down.
How did you...

16:17.560 --> 16:19.654
Oh, yeah. How many times did
you pre-ejaculate again?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.197
Oh, leave him alone.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.359
I bet you were all desperate
virgins back then.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.242
Selena Vega.

16:29.739 --> 16:32.663
That's Selena Vega in front of us.
Wait, wait, wait, Selena...

16:32.742 --> 16:34.744
Hold on, Michelle's
friend from band?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.828
You got it.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.710
Oh, my God. I'm sorry
I didn't recognize you.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.215
You look

16:39.665 --> 16:40.666
different.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.670
Well, next round's
on me, okay, guys?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.843
Hey, that chick was in band?

16:47.215 --> 16:49.434
This is the first long weekend
I have had in a while

16:49.509 --> 16:50.761
so I wanna make it count.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.056
I want the place spotless, and
I want it filled with booze.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.145
And I wanna make sure you're
not around on Sunday night,

16:56.224 --> 16:58.192
'cause I plan on bringing some
ass back from the reunion,

16:58.267 --> 17:00.861
and I wanna tap that without you there.
You got it?

17:01.020 --> 17:04.273
You know, first of all,
Steven, it's my house.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.067
You're lucky I'm
letting you stay here.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.361
Look, you wanted me to
get a job, so I got one.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.201
At least let me have the
house for the weekend.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.616
My house, my rules.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.079
<i>And as for tonight, if you
don't wanna risk coming home</i>

17:15.242 --> 17:16.869
<i>and seeing more of your
mother than you'd like,</i>

17:17.036 --> 17:19.710
I suggest you stay out late.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.000
Gross.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.306
That was really...

17:28.839 --> 17:30.682
Hey, bar wench,
can I get a Budweiser?

17:34.470 --> 17:35.471
Beer down.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.359
What the fuck are you
fuckers doing here?

17:47.108 --> 17:49.031
You made it! Made what?

17:49.110 --> 17:50.157
What are you talking about?

17:50.319 --> 17:53.243
What do you mean?
We sent you an e-mail

17:53.406 --> 17:56.125
about getting together a couple
of days before the reunion.

17:56.284 --> 18:00.209
You know what? I must have put
two F's in "Stifmeister."

18:00.371 --> 18:01.793
What? KEVIN: I'm sorry.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.008
Two F's? You dumbass!

18:08.087 --> 18:09.384
Kev!

18:09.463 --> 18:11.340
Hey, Kevin, is that
a pussy on your face?

18:11.549 --> 18:12.801
Oh, come on!

18:12.967 --> 18:14.685
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

18:14.760 --> 18:15.886
Nice.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.643
So, Stifler,
you're looking sharp.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.144
What are you up to these days?

18:19.849 --> 18:21.601
I work at JBH Global.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.686
Wow! That's a big-time firm.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.937
What do you do over there?

18:25.187 --> 18:27.189
Oh, you know,

18:27.773 --> 18:29.366
investment stuff.

18:29.734 --> 18:32.203
People wonder why our financial
system's falling apart.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.327
Nice scarf. I see you finally
came out of the closet.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.036
How is your mother, Stifler?

18:37.199 --> 18:38.917
You stay away from
my mom, shitbreak.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.579
Okay, boys,
the past is the past.

18:41.662 --> 18:43.289
We can bury
the hatchet here, huh?

18:43.372 --> 18:45.045
Yeah, fuck it.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.960
Hey, short-shorts!
A round of JÃ¤gerbombs for me and my boys!

18:48.127 --> 18:49.470
Go fuck yourself, Stifler.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.011
How the hell does
she know my name?

18:52.757 --> 18:55.055
Lard Arms?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.306
Jesus, Stifler.

18:56.510 --> 18:59.354
Talk about an ugly duckling
turning into a swan, right?

19:00.973 --> 19:02.350
Let me see that.

19:04.018 --> 19:08.774
Oh! Fingered her,
hairy nips, huge boobs.

19:10.066 --> 19:11.443
Oh.

19:12.026 --> 19:13.619
There she is!

19:14.236 --> 19:15.738
<i>The crÃ©me de my cock.</i>

19:16.447 --> 19:17.573
Blowjob Lipstein.

19:17.782 --> 19:21.082
Her given name
was Loni, Stifler.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.962
She used to call me Big Stiffy.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.963
She was the mouth
that got away.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.172
Last call!

19:29.335 --> 19:32.464
Already? Wait here, guys.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.933
Oh! Man, the Senior Wish List.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.060
Wish List?
I don't remember that.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.854
Oh, yeah, man.
It's that cheesy page in the yearbook

19:40.930 --> 19:43.058
where we all had to write
wishes about our future.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.019
What, did you write something cheesy?
Let's see.

19:46.185 --> 19:50.941
"Chris Ostreicher.
Hopes to coach his son's lacrosse team."

19:51.023 --> 19:53.242
Oh! Isn't that the
sweetest thing?

19:53.317 --> 19:54.534
Well,

19:55.569 --> 19:57.742
I guess I thought
I'd have a family by now.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.119
All right, you wanna hear
what you wrote, Finch?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.290
I do.

20:00.449 --> 20:04.249
"Paul Finch hopes to
find le grand amour."

20:05.162 --> 20:06.539
Yes, true love.

20:07.331 --> 20:11.256
Alas, I have yet to find what you
would call a real relationship.

20:11.419 --> 20:14.047
Right, because banging
Stifler's mom didn't count.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.262
All right, let's see
what you got, Kev.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.850
"Kevin Myers. Hopes to
still be living it up"

20:21.011 --> 20:24.106
"with the amazing
Vicky Lathum."

20:24.265 --> 20:25.562
Oh, man! Vicky! What?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.023
I am sure your wife would
be very happy to read that.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.938
What? I was dating
Vicky at the time.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.447
Let me see what I put.

20:34.275 --> 20:35.902
"Jim Levenstein"

20:41.991 --> 20:45.086
"hopes to have the
sex life of Ricky Martin."

20:47.663 --> 20:50.917
So, I'm assuming you didn't
know he was gay back then.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.672
Jim, it's a good thing
you found a woman

20:52.752 --> 20:54.595
with the sex drive
of a dozen groupies. Hmm?

20:55.004 --> 20:57.006
I mean, you're probably having
more sex than any of us.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.350
Probably, you know.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.513
Hope you guys are thirsty.
Stifler Claus is here.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.273
Whoa! Stifler, that's a little
too much, don't you think?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.526
Dude, find your balls
and return them to your sack.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.690
I say we keep this party going.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.693
I say we make this
weekend our bitch.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.325
We could party together, do all the
same shit that we used to do together.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.827
It'll be just like old times.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.659
Hell yes! That's why I'm here.

21:20.821 --> 21:23.324
<i>No Bachelorette,
no Real Housewives.</i>

21:23.491 --> 21:27.041
Thing is, you only get one
chance at your 13th reunion.

21:29.830 --> 21:32.583
I was kind of hoping to spend
a little time with the wife.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.709
Fuck! Dude!

21:33.793 --> 21:36.171
James? What? Come on!

21:36.670 --> 21:39.014
I mean, I'm in. Of course I'm in.
Come on, what?

21:39.173 --> 21:40.174
Yeah! Yeah.

21:40.382 --> 21:43.932
Then, gentlemen, I hope you're
all wearing protection,

21:44.094 --> 21:46.142
because this weekend,
we're gonna fuck shit up!

21:46.931 --> 21:47.978
- Cheers!
- Yeah! All right!

22:08.828 --> 22:10.626
What the fuck?

22:12.206 --> 22:14.174
Holy shit.

22:18.379 --> 22:19.676
Hey!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.261
Hi.

22:22.591 --> 22:23.683
What happened?

22:24.885 --> 22:28.435
I don't really remember.

22:28.597 --> 22:32.522
I blame you. How much did you
let him drink last night?

22:32.685 --> 22:35.404
Honestly,
not that much.

22:35.563 --> 22:38.783
Well, we gotta clean this up
before we go to the lake.

22:38.941 --> 22:42.036
What? The lake?

22:42.736 --> 22:45.285
Yeah, the lake, dude.
It was your idea.

22:45.406 --> 22:48.000
We discussed
all this last night.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.377
Oh, the lake!
Yes, of course, the...

22:50.536 --> 22:52.755
Hey, Jim, can you hand me
those paper towels, please?

22:55.875 --> 22:58.469
Oh, those paper towels?
The paper ones.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.553
Uh...

23:01.922 --> 23:03.390
The paper towels, Jim.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.471
Jim! Yeah...

23:05.551 --> 23:07.019
The paper towels!

23:13.100 --> 23:15.478
I'm really sorry.

23:15.644 --> 23:20.525
Jim, you do realize that
the lid is see-through, right?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.158
Oh, wow.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.579
Good eye.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.166
That's the father of my child.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.144
Oh, come on!

23:49.219 --> 23:51.722
Hey, watch it! Okay, jeez.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.439
Am I wrong, or was this place a lot
more fun when we were younger?

23:55.601 --> 23:58.775
No, no. I think it's the same.
We're just old now.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.154
But were we just as obnoxious
as these kids back in the day?

24:03.317 --> 24:04.489
No.

24:05.110 --> 24:07.329
Us, our generation,
we were more mature.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.161
Hey, guys, check it out.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.659
Vagina shark!

24:15.287 --> 24:16.584
He touched my snatch!

24:17.081 --> 24:18.833
I take that back.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.260
Oh, my God.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.183
Fellas, do you gotta stare?

24:31.345 --> 24:32.346
Yeah. Yeah.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.106
Yes, we do need to stare.

24:35.349 --> 24:39.149
Could Jim
be any more obvious?

24:40.062 --> 24:41.735
Oh, give him a break.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.492
I mean, it's not every day you get to see
a model walking around off the page.

24:46.235 --> 24:49.990
There hasn't been
a whole lot of sexy time

24:50.072 --> 24:52.120
in the Levenstein
household lately.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.200
Why not?

24:54.118 --> 24:56.997
I don't know. I'm a mom now.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.377
Oh, please!

24:59.540 --> 25:01.463
Just because you're
a mom doesn't mean

25:01.542 --> 25:04.091
there isn't a whole other side to you.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.969
Hey, remember that
one time at band camp,

25:08.173 --> 25:10.517
when we licked whipped cream
off each other's...

25:10.592 --> 25:13.812
Yes! Yes! I remember.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.056
Let's keep that
in the past, though, okay?

25:18.642 --> 25:19.689
Oh, she's...

25:20.102 --> 25:22.446
Yeah, well, you gotta do that, or
else you're gonna get tan lines.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.073
Sideboob. There... Sorry.
Sideboob. Ozzy, look!

25:25.232 --> 25:27.610
Okay! Come on!

25:28.318 --> 25:30.491
You're a lucky man, Oz.

25:31.071 --> 25:33.915
Oh, come on, guys.
I think we're all pretty

25:35.159 --> 25:36.786
lucky.

25:39.204 --> 25:42.299
Wait, is that Heather?

25:45.794 --> 25:47.137
Yeah, it is.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.633
Heather.

25:51.759 --> 25:52.760
Chris!

25:53.719 --> 25:54.811
Hey.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.479
What are you doing here?

25:56.638 --> 26:00.393
I guess we had
the same idea, huh?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.107
Chris, this is Ron,
my boyfriend.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.565
Chris Ostreicher, Ron Douglas.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.732
How do you do?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.817
Ron's a cardiologist
at my hospital.

26:09.151 --> 26:11.324
A cardiologist. Wow.

26:11.487 --> 26:15.037
Yeah. And, hey, listen, my friends call
me Doctor Ron, D-Ron or just Dron.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.082
So you feel free.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.705
Okay.

26:17.785 --> 26:18.957
Hey, fuckface!

26:19.495 --> 26:21.168
Choir chick! Whoa!

26:21.997 --> 26:23.590
Nice to see you, too, Stifler.

26:23.791 --> 26:24.792
Who's this douche?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.173
I'm her boyfriend.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.632
So, you two are banging,

26:31.006 --> 26:33.259
and you two used to bang.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.266
This must be awkward
for all of you.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.097
It is now.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.650
That little shit took my top!

26:41.809 --> 26:43.152
Give it back!

26:43.519 --> 26:47.149
Um, that's my girlfriend.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.609
What's this? What's this?

26:51.819 --> 26:54.789
Hey, kid!
What do you think you're doing?

26:54.947 --> 26:57.541
Hey!
Come on, come on, let's go!

26:57.699 --> 26:59.827
Come on, guys. Not cool!

27:00.452 --> 27:02.955
What're you assholes gonna do about it?

27:11.880 --> 27:14.133
Well, that was interesting.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.676
Well, should we do something?

27:16.051 --> 27:17.143
What are we gonna do? Come on.

27:17.219 --> 27:20.393
Agreed. There's no need
to stoop to their level.

27:20.556 --> 27:21.978
Fuck that!

27:22.141 --> 27:24.064
I know exactly
where they're going.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.363
Stifler?

27:46.915 --> 27:48.417
Where the hell is he?

27:48.584 --> 27:49.927
Guys, this is stupid.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.213
I really can't keep Michelle waiting.
Can we just head back?

27:52.379 --> 27:54.256
Hold on.
Let Stifler do his thing.

27:54.423 --> 27:56.517
Yeah, that's what
I'm afraid of.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.726
Did you guys see
the look on their faces?

28:05.893 --> 28:06.940
Fucking awesome.

28:07.102 --> 28:08.570
He is crazy.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.858
I think one of those guys
was Kara's babysitter.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.033
Which one?

28:14.109 --> 28:16.407
You know, the one that
looked like Adam Sandler.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.130
Stifler better not
do anything crazy.

28:26.288 --> 28:27.915
All he's gonna do
is tell them off.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.879
I thought he was gonna
cut their jet skis free.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.589
What happened to pissing
in their suntan lotion?

28:31.752 --> 28:34.221
Hold on. He told me he was
going to steal their beer.

28:35.422 --> 28:36.469
Stifler.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.362
Oh, wait. There he is.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.563
All right.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.945
Yep, he's
taking their beer.

28:54.274 --> 28:56.276
All right, hurry up,
Stifler. Come on.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.496
What is he doing?

28:59.613 --> 29:01.081
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Wait.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.783
Oh, God! KEVIN: Oh, my God.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.080
Steven! No!

29:04.159 --> 29:05.160
Oh, God.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.333
Yo, so you really think Kara's
gonna give it up tonight?

29:07.496 --> 29:09.419
She was waiting until she turns 18.
You do the math.

29:10.540 --> 29:15.262
The only math I know is you've added
your penis to her vagina zero times.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.519
Jennifer's not a skank.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.595
Dude, yes, she is.

29:23.679 --> 29:24.771
I'm gonna throw up.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.274
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

29:27.349 --> 29:28.475
What're you doing?

29:30.644 --> 29:32.362
Hurry up. Come on!

29:33.355 --> 29:34.607
Down it, man!
Just chug it! Chug it!

29:34.690 --> 29:36.692
Do it. Do it! Don't puss out.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.360
Don't puss out!

29:38.443 --> 29:39.444
Let's just go. Let's go.

29:39.528 --> 29:40.529
Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.707
You want another?

29:43.865 --> 29:44.866
For sure.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.626
Guys, I'm telling you, tonight is gonna
be the night she promised me a year ago.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.800
What the...

29:58.880 --> 30:00.223
Hey! Dipshit!

30:09.641 --> 30:10.733
No!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.236
No, no!

30:17.649 --> 30:19.572
Stifler! Are you crazy?

30:19.860 --> 30:23.160
Jesus, Stifler, what happened
to just stealing their beer?

30:23.322 --> 30:25.245
I know, this is so
much better, right?

30:25.407 --> 30:27.205
What?

30:27.409 --> 30:29.252
You destroyed
their jet skis.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.413
They splashed us.

30:32.414 --> 30:33.415
So...

30:39.212 --> 30:40.680
Come on, guys.
That was pretty funny.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.683
Maybe in high school it was funny.
Now it's just a felony.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.014
Only if we get caught.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.846
Yeah, you gotta admit, it was nice
giving those kids a little payback.

30:48.013 --> 30:50.015
Maybe it was good that they will
learn to respect their elders.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.399
Exactly!

30:51.558 --> 30:54.232
Hey, give me a second, I gotta
find some toilet paper.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.611
That's gross.

30:56.521 --> 30:57.989
What's up,
Class of '99-ers?

30:58.148 --> 31:00.116
Oh, my God! Vicky!

31:00.192 --> 31:01.193
Hi!

31:01.276 --> 31:02.277
Hey!

31:02.444 --> 31:03.616
I can't believe you're here.

31:03.695 --> 31:05.288
Yeah, I flew in from
New York last night.

31:05.447 --> 31:06.915
I've been hanging
outwith my parents.

31:07.074 --> 31:09.122
They were actually just
talking about you earlier.

31:09.284 --> 31:10.831
Really? About what?

31:10.994 --> 31:13.463
That time they caught us
making out at the Falls.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.044
Oh, right.

31:15.123 --> 31:18.093
The Falls. Wow, I haven't
been there in forever.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.299
Michelle used to love
going to the Falls.

31:20.462 --> 31:21.805
The place is romance incarnate.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.138
Hell, yeah.
I got my first rim job at the Falls.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.426
Okay.

31:28.303 --> 31:29.304
Hey, sweetie.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.389
Mmm, sweetie pie!

31:30.639 --> 31:31.686
Hello.

31:32.516 --> 31:36.566
So, the guys were all talking
about heading over to the Falls.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.781
Well, what about
Jim and Michelle time?

31:39.856 --> 31:42.154
I was thinking it could
be kind of romantic.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.867
Well, I'd love to, but your
dad has been with Ev all day.

31:45.946 --> 31:47.698
Yeah, no, you're right.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.866
Okay. Yeah, we'll
just, we'll go home.

31:50.033 --> 31:53.082
Oh, no, no.
You go and have fun.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.253
Really? Yeah.

31:54.329 --> 31:57.924
Just, when you get home,
you just better be ready.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.630
You better be ready.

31:59.793 --> 32:01.340
I'm ready.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.642
Um, Stifler, do you know
where you're going?

32:10.804 --> 32:13.273
I know this place
like the back of my cock.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.244
It looks like
a high school party.

32:28.155 --> 32:29.532
With high school chicks.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.830
It's on.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.542
Watch it, Stifler. You know these
girls are, like, half your age.

32:35.704 --> 32:36.796
I know.

32:41.918 --> 32:46.549
Okay, is it just me, or do girls
today seem a bit sluttier?

32:46.715 --> 32:47.762
Definitely.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.890
Teen sex, rainbow parties,
sexting nude photos...

32:51.052 --> 32:53.430
I saw it all on
<i>Kathie</i> Lee & Hoda.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.645
Happy birthday!

33:02.564 --> 33:03.656
Jim?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.783
Kara. You came!

33:05.984 --> 33:07.361
Hey!

33:08.445 --> 33:09.492
Sorry.

33:10.822 --> 33:11.914
Happy birthday.

33:13.366 --> 33:15.460
Oh, my God,
is this the babysitter?

33:15.535 --> 33:16.502
Mmm-hmm.

33:16.578 --> 33:19.081
You make it sound like I'm a superhero.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.966
Faster than a speeding stroller,
more powerful than a mini-van.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.552
I told you he was funny.

33:24.711 --> 33:25.837
He's adorable.

33:28.173 --> 33:30.096
Hey, Jim. Do you wanna
introduce me to your friends?

33:30.258 --> 33:31.259
No.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.017
Girls, this is Stifler.

33:36.097 --> 33:37.940
So, how do you know
my best friend Jim?

33:38.099 --> 33:39.817
Jim used to be my babysitter.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.693
Hey, I was just
gonna do a birthday shot.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.115
Do you guys
wanna do one with me?

33:45.190 --> 33:46.316
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.400
Yeah. Oh, ye& yes, yes.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.369
I shouldn't.
Yes, we should, yes, we should.

33:49.819 --> 33:53.824
Never have I ever
had sex in public.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.998
Really? None of you?

34:01.164 --> 34:03.792
Oh, come on, Heather.
You haven't drank once.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.506
You are such a prude!

34:05.669 --> 34:09.424
Or maybe I've just
never had sex in public.

34:10.257 --> 34:15.764
Okay, never have I
ever been in an orgy.

34:21.351 --> 34:23.274
They were really nice guys.

34:24.603 --> 34:27.152
Believe it or not, this is
my first high school party.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.783
You didn't miss much.

34:28.942 --> 34:33.493
I always preferred staying at
home, throwing on a little NPR.

34:33.655 --> 34:35.498
You were so much
cooler than me.

34:35.824 --> 34:39.579
I sat around writing
<i>X-Files</i> fan fiction.

34:42.121 --> 34:47.344
I translated The Brothers
Karamazov into Latin for fun.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.172
That is so sexy.

34:52.257 --> 34:53.679
You know it is.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.518
I've only been
working as an architect

34:55.594 --> 34:58.017
for the last few years,
and from home.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.056
You've been with the same
company for over ten years.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.476
That's awesome, it sounds like
everything is working out for you.

35:03.518 --> 35:05.941
Yeah. I mean, everything's
good, especially work-wise.

35:06.021 --> 35:07.523
But now that we're
back here in the town,

35:07.647 --> 35:09.149
and we see, like,
all of our old friends,

35:09.316 --> 35:11.865
and everyone's married
and having kids,

35:12.027 --> 35:14.951
it just makes me,
you know, think.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.537
You okay there, Kev?

35:18.908 --> 35:22.208
Yeah, I just don't
normally drink like this.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.418
You're telling me you haven't
gotten a little bit tipsy

35:24.497 --> 35:25.919
on Myers Family Wine Night?

35:26.082 --> 35:29.131
I see somebody's been
stalking my Facebook page.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.672
At least I don't take
pictures of my meals.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.306
Who's stalking who now?

35:33.465 --> 35:36.810
Okay, so I've been by your
page maybe once or twice.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.222
You were dating someone
named Alessandro?

35:40.805 --> 35:44.059
You know, he does know that he can take
a picture with his shirt on, right?

35:44.225 --> 35:47.320
Alessandro is long gone.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.990
It's over, huh?

35:55.236 --> 35:57.238
Okay, after this drink,
I have to go home.

35:57.405 --> 35:58.372
Jim.

35:58.448 --> 36:02.294
There's a smoking hot 18-year-old girl
over there that you used to babysit.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.420
And you're not going to
do anything about that?

36:04.579 --> 36:06.673
Need I remind you that
I am married to Michelle?

36:06.748 --> 36:07.749
Exactly.

36:08.249 --> 36:13.631
Dude, these young chicks, they know
some crazy shit in the bedroom.

36:14.464 --> 36:17.013
You could take what
you learn from Kara,

36:17.175 --> 36:19.769
bring it home,
and apply it to Michelle.

36:20.595 --> 36:23.098
You do care about your
marriage, don't you, Jim?

36:23.264 --> 36:24.766
What are you talking
about, Stifler?

36:24.849 --> 36:27.022
I'm not gonna cheat on my wife!

36:27.185 --> 36:29.187
I'm a father
for Christ's sakes.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.356
Yeah, that's perfect.

36:31.523 --> 36:34.151
Yeah, chicks love a father figure.
Keep playing that card, dude.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.490
It's not a card,
it's the truth.

36:36.653 --> 36:38.030
Hey. Hi.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.456
What are you guys
talking about?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.784
Oh, you know... Justâ€œ

36:41.950 --> 36:45.375
Jim was just saying how much
fun he had taking care of you.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.165
Hey, ladies, why don't we give
them some time to catch up?

36:48.248 --> 36:49.420
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.

36:49.499 --> 36:51.797
No, that's not necessary.
We should all hang out together.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.553
Why don't we all...
Stifler, just...

36:53.628 --> 36:55.050
Be her daddy.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.137
Stifler? Stifler!

37:00.135 --> 37:05.141
So, sounds like you and Mia have
quite an adventurous lifestyle.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.726
Sometimes a little
too adventurous.

37:07.892 --> 37:12.398
Wow. Well, Heather's a bit
more on the conservative side.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.481
But, uh...

37:13.565 --> 37:14.987
Hey! Hi.

37:16.192 --> 37:20.663
But, I gotta be honest, Chris, I
could use a little adventure myself.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.703
What are you getting at, Ron?

37:22.866 --> 37:27.588
I'm just saying that usually
I'm not one for swapping,

37:27.746 --> 37:33.003
but the fact that you've been with
Heather already, kind of makes it okay.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.588
So, what do you think?

37:37.922 --> 37:38.923
Think they'd be into it?

37:41.176 --> 37:42.723
I'm kidding.
Come on, I'm kidding!

37:44.345 --> 37:46.188
Seriously,
I would never do that!

37:47.515 --> 37:48.937
Unless you guys wanted to.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.854
So you've really been to every
country in South America?

37:53.021 --> 37:54.944
No, no, not all of them.

37:55.106 --> 37:58.201
And I don't consider
French Guiana a nation.

38:00.403 --> 38:03.202
I remember, I couldn't
wait till graduation

38:03.364 --> 38:06.288
so I could leave this town
and reinvent myself.

38:06.576 --> 38:09.170
You have certainly
reinvented yourself.

38:09.245 --> 38:10.337
I don't know.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.632
There's just a part of me
that still wishes that

38:12.707 --> 38:15.130
I could just explore
the world, you know?

38:15.293 --> 38:17.136
Be everything I set out to be.

38:17.587 --> 38:21.308
You can be whoever you wanna be.
You just gotta be it.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.304
You wanna make out? Yeah.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.985
Are you crazy?
I love the Twilight books.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.896
New Moon is my favorite.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.064
Mine, too!

38:36.147 --> 38:38.775
Oh, my God!
We have, like, so much in common!

38:38.942 --> 38:40.159
I know! I know!

38:42.403 --> 38:43.575
Wanna hit this?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.411
In more ways than one.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.464
I don't know who this is, but
I'm pretty fucking busy right now.

38:57.627 --> 38:58.844
So sorry to interrupt, Stafler.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.131
Didn't realize the Special
Olympics competed at night.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.298
Oh, fuck.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.351
What the hell's
going on over there?

39:05.426 --> 39:06.848
What, are you choking
on your own dick?

39:07.804 --> 39:10.853
Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy,
nothing.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.684
What can I do for you, sir?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.694
Bob from Acquisitions
had a heart attack.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.521
Some idiot told him
that he was fired.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.905
<i>He flipped out, I don't know.</i>

39:18.064 --> 39:20.408
Listen, I need someone
to finish his presentation.

39:20.567 --> 39:23.320
I need you to go in on Sunday
and get everything ready. Yes?

39:23.486 --> 39:25.784
Oh, wait, Sunday.

39:25.947 --> 39:27.870
I got my high school reunion.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.158
Oh, wow, how fun!

39:29.242 --> 39:30.664
Yeah, no, I'll just
call the chairman,

39:30.743 --> 39:31.835
and I'll get him to reschedule.

39:31.995 --> 39:34.248
Seriously?
Hey, that would be awesome!

39:34.414 --> 39:37.793
That was a fucking joke, you moron.
Jesus Christ, what am I doing?

39:38.459 --> 39:40.757
You know what, I am gonna
handle this myself.

39:40.837 --> 39:43.716
No. No, no, no,
listen, Mr. Duraiswamy,

39:43.882 --> 39:46.601
I can do it, okay?
I promise, I'll get it done.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.303
Just don't fuck up, Stafler.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.935
It's Stifler.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.065
Dick! Hey, ladies...

39:53.474 --> 39:55.602
Ladies? They bailed, dude.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.486
Aw, fuck!

39:59.647 --> 40:00.648
Ugh! Um...

40:01.232 --> 40:02.484
Ooh!

40:02.567 --> 40:05.992
Hey, Kara, how are you
getting home tonight?

40:06.738 --> 40:08.832
AJ was supposed to
drive my car back,

40:08.990 --> 40:10.333
but he hasn't
even shown up yet.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.835
Some lame excuse
about his jet skis.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.667
Can you believe that jerk?

40:16.831 --> 40:18.333
What about you?

40:18.499 --> 40:19.671
Will you take me?

40:19.834 --> 40:22.053
Uh... Um...

40:22.670 --> 40:25.674
Come on! We're going
to the same place.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.763
Besides, it wouldn't
be responsible

40:27.842 --> 40:30.186
to let me drive
in this condition.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.600
Right?

40:38.895 --> 40:40.238
Okay, Kara.

40:40.855 --> 40:44.234
Hey! Whoa! Careful!
Careful. Yeah.

40:44.359 --> 40:46.077
Oh, my God, I love this song.

40:46.235 --> 40:47.282
It's a good one.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.909
Isn't classic rock the best?

40:49.072 --> 40:52.372
Classic rock?
This is classic rock now?

40:54.202 --> 40:56.421
Hey, you know, Kara, you
should drink some more water.

40:56.496 --> 40:58.043
Where's that bottle I gave you?

40:58.206 --> 41:00.129
Oh, it's right here. Okay.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.385
In the back.

41:07.715 --> 41:11.390
Shit. Sorry. Sorry.
There was a...

41:11.469 --> 41:15.474
There was a little baby
squirrel in the road, so...

41:15.640 --> 41:20.111
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!
That's not water. Okay.

41:20.269 --> 41:23.614
It's a little too much now.

41:23.773 --> 41:27.573
I love how, after all these years,
you're still taking care of me.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.705
Well, you know, a
babysitter's job never ends.

41:30.780 --> 41:34.000
You knew I always
had a crush on you, right?

41:35.910 --> 41:37.253
No.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.540
I want you to be my first.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.260
Your first?

41:44.419 --> 41:46.421
Oh, God. Okay. Um...

41:46.587 --> 41:48.635
Kara, listen. Um...

41:49.674 --> 41:54.145
A person's virginity is
something sacred, you know?

41:54.303 --> 41:55.805
You should save yourself
for someone special.

41:55.888 --> 41:56.935
You're special.

41:57.015 --> 42:00.485
No! Not special.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.771
You think? I really...

42:03.146 --> 42:04.773
What are you doing?

42:04.939 --> 42:06.031
Hey, what are you doing?

42:06.190 --> 42:08.693
Come on. No one
will ever find out.

42:10.194 --> 42:12.117
I don't know. I don't think...

42:29.280 --> 42:30.657
You don't think I'm pretty?

42:30.740 --> 42:35.541
Huh? Oh, no! You're very pretty, Kara.
You're very, very...

42:35.619 --> 42:37.371
Really? Yes, very pretty.

42:37.455 --> 42:38.877
But I... Very pretty. Thanks.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.462
Oh, my God!

42:40.624 --> 42:43.878
Holy shit! What?

42:45.212 --> 42:46.213
Oh, my... Where did your...

42:46.297 --> 42:47.298
Come on.

42:47.465 --> 42:49.809
I can't think of
a better birthday gift.

42:49.967 --> 42:51.514
What about the new iPhone?

42:51.594 --> 42:53.562
Huh? Maybe a little pendant?
The new Nicki Minaj album?

42:53.637 --> 42:55.731
No. No? Boobies.

42:55.848 --> 42:57.145
I want you! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

42:57.224 --> 42:58.476
You can't... Don't do that.

42:58.559 --> 43:00.061
That's not good, don't...

43:00.144 --> 43:01.646
Come on, stop

43:01.812 --> 43:03.689
Kara! Kara! Stop it.

43:04.315 --> 43:05.441
Shit!

43:07.485 --> 43:08.828
Whoa!

43:09.820 --> 43:10.992
Shit. Kara?

43:11.655 --> 43:13.157
Holy Jesus! Kara?

43:13.324 --> 43:15.702
Kara! Kara!
Please wake up, Kara!

43:15.868 --> 43:17.541
Kara, wake up. Kara!

43:17.703 --> 43:18.704
Are you okay?

43:18.829 --> 43:19.921
Oh, Jesus, God!

43:19.997 --> 43:21.419
Oh, my God, are you all right?

43:22.041 --> 43:23.668
Hey, hi.

43:24.752 --> 43:26.846
Jim? Hey!

43:27.004 --> 43:29.553
What? This is crazy!

43:29.757 --> 43:31.134
Are you all right?

43:31.217 --> 43:34.687
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm okay. I was just... Um...

43:34.845 --> 43:37.223
I was reaching for something.

43:37.389 --> 43:39.562
Everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

43:40.101 --> 43:41.444
I don't know if you've heard.
Mmm?

43:41.519 --> 43:42.520
Did you hear?

43:43.187 --> 43:45.781
I am in charge of the reunion.

43:45.940 --> 43:48.739
Oh! Yeah, no, that's...
Yeah, that's right.

43:48.901 --> 43:50.369
Got a whole '90s theme planned.

43:50.528 --> 43:52.280
Oh. That's...

43:52.446 --> 43:54.244
I booked Chumbawamba.

43:54.323 --> 43:56.371
Yeah. But the pricks
cancelled yesterday.

43:56.575 --> 43:59.374
Was a setback, but you know me,

43:59.578 --> 44:02.957
"I get knocked down but I
get up again."

44:05.918 --> 44:07.920
Oh, my God!
Okay, I see what's going on.

44:14.510 --> 44:15.682
Yep.

44:15.761 --> 44:16.887
I'll see you later, buddy.

44:17.054 --> 44:18.727
All right then, I'll see you.

44:21.225 --> 44:23.728
Jesus, God. Kara.
Kara, wake up.

44:23.894 --> 44:25.896
I just need a nap. What?

44:26.063 --> 44:28.157
Kara, this isn't time
for a nap. Kara, wake up.

44:28.315 --> 44:29.612
This isn't napping time.

44:30.067 --> 44:32.411
Kara? Shit.

44:37.491 --> 44:41.337
Oh, God, this is bad.
This is very, very bad.

44:52.798 --> 44:54.141
What took you guys so long?

44:54.300 --> 44:56.348
We were looking for Kevin.
Couldn't find him.

44:56.510 --> 44:59.980
Plus, that hot piece of ass Oz is banging
got wasted, so we had to drop her off.

45:00.139 --> 45:01.140
You brought him?

45:01.223 --> 45:02.395
Of course they brought me.

45:02.516 --> 45:04.063
When you guys were busy
jacking off in high school,

45:04.143 --> 45:06.111
I was running this
drill every weekend.

45:06.270 --> 45:08.193
Now, let's see what
we are dealing with.

45:10.774 --> 45:11.775
Oh!

45:12.109 --> 45:14.111
Holy shit!

45:14.278 --> 45:15.245
Way to go, Jim.

45:15.321 --> 45:18.495
Shh. Okay, nothing happened, Stifler. Okay?
Nothing happened.

45:18.657 --> 45:19.658
Stop that!

45:19.867 --> 45:20.914
I'm sorry.

45:20.993 --> 45:22.415
So, Jim, what do you wanna do?

45:22.494 --> 45:23.746
I don't know.

45:23.829 --> 45:25.627
I can't just leave her
here naked, you know?

45:25.789 --> 45:28.463
I mean, if the cops come by
and find out I'm involved,

45:29.293 --> 45:30.465
I'm screwed.

45:30.628 --> 45:32.505
That leaves us
with two options.

45:33.464 --> 45:35.137
We dump the body or
we sneak her inside.

45:35.299 --> 45:37.301
Dump the body?
This isn't a mob hit.

45:37.468 --> 45:38.685
Okay, wait a second.

45:38.844 --> 45:42.189
I have been in her house
a million times to babysit.

45:42.348 --> 45:45.397
I can totally sneak her in
through the back door.

45:45.559 --> 45:48.153
I need you guys to
distract her parents.

45:48.312 --> 45:50.030
Do you think you can do that?

45:50.397 --> 45:54.493
I'm an expert, Jim.
Trust me. I got this shit.

46:01.992 --> 46:03.539
Good evening, sir.

46:03.702 --> 46:05.545
My friend's car broke down,

46:05.704 --> 46:09.174
and we were just wondering if we
could use your phone to call AAA.

46:10.000 --> 46:13.379
You mean to tell me that none
of you have cell phones?

46:21.220 --> 46:24.394
<i>Oh, my God, I know you.
You were on Celebrity Dance Off.</i>

46:24.556 --> 46:26.479
Oh, yeah!

46:26.558 --> 46:27.684
Ostreicher.

46:27.851 --> 46:29.068
Oh, yeah.

46:29.228 --> 46:30.354
Hey, come on in.

46:32.189 --> 46:33.782
That was very smooth, Stifler.

46:33.941 --> 46:35.193
Shut up, shitbreak.

46:35.359 --> 46:37.532
The last time I did this,
cell phones didn't exist.

46:53.085 --> 46:54.211
Shit!

47:00.217 --> 47:01.434
Daddy.

47:03.095 --> 47:04.142
Look, Mom, Daddy!

47:04.221 --> 47:05.222
Shit!

47:19.987 --> 47:21.739
Oh, fuck!

47:22.823 --> 47:24.416
Kara?

47:25.576 --> 47:26.577
Kara?

47:28.537 --> 47:29.584
Kara?

47:29.747 --> 47:31.966
Gonna have to find me.

47:32.041 --> 47:33.213
Kara?

47:34.376 --> 47:36.378
Thank you, Sheranda.
You've been very helpful.

47:36.462 --> 47:38.885
You get a Triple
A-plus in my book.

47:39.048 --> 47:42.097
Oh, you take care, too.
Okay, yeah, bye-bye.

47:43.093 --> 47:47.473
So, that was AAA on the phone and
they should be here in a jiffy.

47:48.390 --> 47:50.108
Does this song sound familiar?

47:55.397 --> 47:58.071
You were such a good dancer.
I felt so bad when you got voted off.

47:58.275 --> 47:59.322
Thank you.

47:59.485 --> 48:01.487
But I have to say you're
much sexier in person.

48:01.695 --> 48:05.666
Okay. Calm down there, Susan.

48:06.450 --> 48:09.078
Dude, she wants to fuck
you big time, dude.

48:09.244 --> 48:11.417
You got to hit that.
No fucking way.

48:11.580 --> 48:12.832
Do it for Jim, dude,
don't be selfish.

48:13.290 --> 48:16.134
Hey, you know what?
I think I have to go to the bathroom.

48:17.002 --> 48:19.096
Kara, this is not funny.

48:19.296 --> 48:21.970
Kara, come on! Kara, come out.

48:22.132 --> 48:23.349
Boo!

48:23.509 --> 48:24.806
Oh, my God!

48:29.637 --> 48:31.435
Come on. Okay, good.

48:31.597 --> 48:33.270
You never could find me.

48:33.432 --> 48:36.151
Jim, I don't mean to alarm you
but you don't have much time.

48:36.310 --> 48:37.311
Yes, I know.

48:37.478 --> 48:38.821
I like your scarf. Okay.

48:38.979 --> 48:40.652
I like your breasts Door.

48:40.815 --> 48:42.283
Would it be okay
if I get a picture?

48:42.441 --> 48:43.442
Sure.

48:47.947 --> 48:49.540
I know it's in here somewhere.

48:53.661 --> 48:55.629
Okay, a bottle of hair spray...

48:55.704 --> 48:56.751
You guys all right?

48:56.831 --> 48:58.174
Yeah. Yeah.

48:58.958 --> 49:00.005
You know something?

49:00.209 --> 49:05.010
I really was admiring how clean
your toilet was in your bathroom.

49:05.548 --> 49:06.674
Thanks.

49:07.341 --> 49:09.514
You know what?
I have to use the restroom, too.

49:09.677 --> 49:10.803
No, you don't.

49:18.394 --> 49:19.520
Let's get in bed.

49:19.687 --> 49:20.734
Come on and get in bed with me?

49:20.813 --> 49:21.939
No, I'm not getting in bed...

49:22.022 --> 49:23.069
Come on. Get in bed with me.

49:23.190 --> 49:25.443
No, I'm not... Kara, please.
Oh, God. Please.

49:25.526 --> 49:26.527
Oh, shit!

49:27.695 --> 49:28.992
Stifler, what are
you doing here?

49:29.155 --> 49:30.998
I just wanted another glimpse.
No.

49:31.157 --> 49:32.579
Why'd you put her clothes
back on, dude? Boo.

49:32.658 --> 49:33.875
You have to go.

49:35.536 --> 49:36.753
What was that?

49:36.871 --> 49:39.090
That sounded like
it came from outside.

49:39.248 --> 49:41.091
No, that came from Kara's room.

49:41.250 --> 49:42.342
Oh, Jesus.

49:42.418 --> 49:43.419
Kara?

49:45.463 --> 49:46.464
Oh, my God.

49:48.215 --> 49:49.432
Go, go, go!

49:56.724 --> 49:58.101
What the hell's
going on in here?

50:00.060 --> 50:01.357
Hi, Daddy.

50:02.104 --> 50:03.151
How'd you get back in?

50:04.231 --> 50:05.403
I don't remember.

50:05.566 --> 50:07.034
You don't remember?

50:07.902 --> 50:08.949
What was that sound?

50:09.028 --> 50:09.995
I don't know.

50:10.070 --> 50:11.162
What do you mean,
you don't know?

50:11.238 --> 50:12.239
I don't know.

50:14.241 --> 50:15.584
You've been drinking,
haven't you?

50:15.743 --> 50:16.869
No.

50:17.036 --> 50:19.835
Kara, I told you these boys
try to get you drunk

50:19.914 --> 50:21.541
so they can take
advantage of you.

50:21.624 --> 50:23.217
I'm old enough
to know that, Dad.

50:23.375 --> 50:24.968
Yeah, well, I don't
want to go to jail

50:25.044 --> 50:26.967
for kicking some
horny kid's teeth in

50:27.046 --> 50:28.798
but I will, believe me.

50:32.468 --> 50:33.594
What is that?

50:33.761 --> 50:37.061
Oh, that's Mr. Moo!

50:37.806 --> 50:40.605
Will you get him for me,
Daddy? Please.

50:57.826 --> 50:59.954
I can't be mad at my angel.

51:05.960 --> 51:08.133
Happy birthday, princess.

51:08.337 --> 51:09.429
Thanks, Dad.

51:18.931 --> 51:20.023
What are you doing?

51:20.808 --> 51:22.151
Nothing.

51:25.729 --> 51:27.026
Oh, jeez.

51:29.275 --> 51:30.322
Stifler?

51:31.485 --> 51:32.577
Stifler?

51:32.653 --> 51:33.700
Up here, dude.

51:35.155 --> 51:36.498
I told you I was an expert.

51:37.658 --> 51:38.875
Oh, shit.

51:39.535 --> 51:41.162
What the hell is going on now?

51:44.081 --> 51:45.253
Hey.

51:45.332 --> 51:47.209
Want to go to
a Justin Bieber concert?

51:47.293 --> 51:48.715
Uh... Jim?

51:49.003 --> 51:50.380
Stifler, come on. Come on!

51:50.546 --> 51:51.843
Let's go.

51:52.965 --> 51:55.718
You and you, stay here.

51:56.218 --> 51:57.435
Don't push me.

51:58.721 --> 52:00.189
Whoa! Oh, my God.

52:03.183 --> 52:04.230
Ah!

52:04.310 --> 52:05.653
Kara, where
the hell are you?

52:05.728 --> 52:07.526
I'm on my way to
your place and...

52:10.858 --> 52:12.235
What the...

52:12.318 --> 52:13.365
Fuck!

52:18.699 --> 52:20.497
What the hell is going on?

52:21.410 --> 52:23.037
Oh, God!

52:35.174 --> 52:37.552
Hey, stud.

52:37.718 --> 52:39.561
I thought you'd never...

53:00.658 --> 53:04.834
Oh, shit, shit.
We were supposed to...

53:04.953 --> 53:06.000
No, it's fine.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.082
What? No, God, it's not fine.

53:09.124 --> 53:12.128
Shoot! I'm so sorry, Michelle.
I really... I wanted to, I just...

53:12.294 --> 53:14.342
I'm going to drop
Ev at my grandma's

53:14.421 --> 53:16.423
and I'll be back
this afternoon.

53:16.590 --> 53:18.558
No, Michelle, hold on.

53:22.429 --> 53:23.897
Jim, I'm worried.

53:24.973 --> 53:26.566
What are you worried about?

53:26.725 --> 53:30.571
Just we're like so out of sync.

53:32.648 --> 53:34.275
I just...

53:34.441 --> 53:36.944
I don't know how much longer
we can go on like this.

53:39.446 --> 53:43.667
I promise you I will do everything
I can to make it up to you.

53:43.992 --> 53:45.289
Okay?

53:45.452 --> 53:47.079
Stifler's having
a party tonight.

53:48.247 --> 53:52.718
Okay, I know that doesn't
sound romantic or anything,

53:52.793 --> 53:58.300
but remember our first time
was at a Stifler party.

53:58.465 --> 54:00.012
You made me your bitch.

54:02.636 --> 54:05.014
Yes. Yes, I did.

54:24.533 --> 54:26.035
Tell me when, okay?

54:26.368 --> 54:27.620
What the fuck?

54:37.004 --> 54:38.347
Mmm.

54:55.189 --> 54:57.487
So, Mia.

54:58.484 --> 55:01.533
She's a free spirit.

55:01.695 --> 55:03.197
She's something else.

55:03.363 --> 55:04.865
Yeah, she is.

55:06.909 --> 55:09.708
Wait a minute, do I sense
a little jealousy there?

55:09.870 --> 55:11.372
No. Mmm-mmm. No?

55:11.538 --> 55:13.791
Hey, don't forget, you were
the one who broke up with me

55:13.874 --> 55:15.171
before you went to med school.

55:15.250 --> 55:19.426
Hey, you were moving to LA
with no return in sight.

55:19.588 --> 55:22.057
You can't blame me for
wanting to settle down.

55:22.382 --> 55:24.555
No, I don't.

55:25.385 --> 55:28.138
I just don't
want you to settle.

55:28.764 --> 55:30.937
Look who's jealous now.

55:31.099 --> 55:33.898
I wouldn't call being
with Ron "settling."

55:34.061 --> 55:36.564
Oh, no, he's gorgeous on paper.

55:36.939 --> 55:38.361
What is that supposed to mean?

55:38.732 --> 55:40.450
Nothing. Um...

55:41.610 --> 55:44.705
I'm sorry. You're right.

55:46.406 --> 55:48.079
I am a bit jealous.

55:49.910 --> 55:51.253
You know, it's funny.

55:52.204 --> 55:55.754
In some ways, you've
completely changed,

55:55.916 --> 55:58.886
and, in other ways,
you're exactly the same.

55:59.044 --> 56:01.092
Heather, you can believe this,

56:01.255 --> 56:02.757
nothing's changed.

56:05.217 --> 56:06.264
Oh, my God.

56:06.426 --> 56:08.053
Chris Ostreicher?

56:08.595 --> 56:09.767
Hi, girls.

56:09.847 --> 56:10.973
Can I get a pic?

56:11.139 --> 56:12.231
Sure.

56:17.896 --> 56:18.943
Dad?

56:20.649 --> 56:21.946
Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Jim.

56:22.109 --> 56:23.736
I'm just going to
run out for a sec.

56:23.902 --> 56:26.746
I was just watching
your old Bar Mitzvah tape.

56:28.615 --> 56:30.162
<i>I got
your Jew scarf!</i>

56:30.325 --> 56:31.952
<i>Give it back, Stifler.</i>

56:34.746 --> 56:40.173
<i>I think I'm the happiest man
in the world thanks to you.</i>

56:45.757 --> 56:47.680
Yeah, I miss her too, Dad.

56:49.678 --> 56:50.850
I know.

56:59.187 --> 57:03.158
Dad, you've always been
there to give me advice.

57:03.483 --> 57:07.158
But if there's anything
that you want to talk about,

57:08.488 --> 57:09.990
I'm here for you.

57:11.533 --> 57:14.002
Yeah, I don't think
there's anything

57:14.077 --> 57:16.500
I really need
to talk about, Jim.

57:17.456 --> 57:20.505
Do you think maybe
it's time for you to

57:20.959 --> 57:22.336
meet someone else?

57:23.503 --> 57:25.551
Dad, it's okay.

57:25.714 --> 57:29.844
What you're going through
is perfectly natural.

57:30.761 --> 57:33.560
You know, there are
services out there...

57:33.722 --> 57:34.769
Services? Yeah.

57:34.848 --> 57:36.065
Like what?

57:36.224 --> 57:38.022
A happy ending? What's that?

57:38.185 --> 57:39.232
Because I won't go there.

57:39.311 --> 57:40.312
Oh, my God.

57:40.437 --> 57:42.439
I don't need that...
I don't need that kind of massage, Jim.

57:42.522 --> 57:43.614
That's not what I was...

57:43.690 --> 57:45.283
Because, you know what,
it's dangerous.

57:45.359 --> 57:46.827
And you can pick things up.

57:46.902 --> 57:48.779
You don't even wanna know
what you can pick up.

57:48.946 --> 57:50.448
Talk to your uncle Mort.
I'd rather not.

57:50.530 --> 57:51.747
He was in the hospital
for two weeks.

57:51.823 --> 57:53.291
That's disgusting.

57:56.536 --> 57:59.039
I was talking about

57:59.748 --> 58:01.341
online dating services.

58:03.043 --> 58:04.090
No, Jim.

58:04.252 --> 58:07.301
Yeah, right, at my age?
I don't think so.

58:07.464 --> 58:09.466
I've been out of
the game for so long.

58:09.549 --> 58:11.051
There wasn't even
a game back then.

58:11.134 --> 58:15.139
Dad, don't worry.
I'll hook you up.

58:20.394 --> 58:21.691
Do you have those photos?

58:22.062 --> 58:23.655
Here you go.

58:23.981 --> 58:24.982
Wow.

58:25.065 --> 58:26.237
Yeah. Oh.

58:26.400 --> 58:27.652
We might need something
a little more recent.

58:27.734 --> 58:28.735
Do you think?

58:30.404 --> 58:33.499
Do you have something
that's a bit sexier?

58:34.324 --> 58:35.541
Gotcha.

58:39.621 --> 58:40.622
Did you...

58:41.248 --> 58:42.465
Favorite music.

58:42.749 --> 58:43.750
Um...

58:44.001 --> 58:45.378
Herman's Hermits.

58:45.752 --> 58:46.753
Okay.

58:47.587 --> 58:48.554
Oh...

58:48.630 --> 58:51.600
Girls, one at a time, please.

58:51.925 --> 58:53.097
Interests and hobbies.

58:53.260 --> 58:54.352
Sudoku.

58:54.511 --> 58:55.603
We'll come back to this one.

59:02.519 --> 59:04.521
Are we sure we're
not taking off too much?

59:04.688 --> 59:07.407
These caterpillars are
kind of my trademark.

59:09.276 --> 59:11.950
Okay... Perfect.

59:12.112 --> 59:14.535
Take a look. I'm nervous.

59:18.452 --> 59:21.456
Oh, that's fantastic!

59:21.621 --> 59:24.625
That is a great look for me!

59:24.875 --> 59:25.876
Huh?

59:25.959 --> 59:29.589
Leaner lines.
I still have mobility.

59:30.589 --> 59:32.557
Why didn't I do
this 30 years ago?

59:32.632 --> 59:33.633
Looking good.

59:33.800 --> 59:35.768
Why don't we test this
new look out tonight?

59:36.094 --> 59:37.095
Oh, um...

59:37.471 --> 59:40.850
The thing is, Stifler is
throwing a party tonight.

59:41.141 --> 59:42.984
Oh! Well, another time.

59:43.143 --> 59:45.362
But you could come with us.

59:45.979 --> 59:47.276
It would be nice to
get out of the house.

59:47.439 --> 59:48.986
I do have to warn you, though,

59:49.149 --> 59:52.403
Stifler's parties
can get a little.

59:52.569 --> 59:53.741
Wild.

01:00:05.957 --> 01:00:09.336
What the fuck is this?

01:00:10.170 --> 01:00:12.172
Who the hell changed the music?

01:00:12.339 --> 01:00:14.637
Sorry, we thought this
was more baby-friendly.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:17.599
Didn't we? Yes, we did.

01:00:17.761 --> 01:00:19.479
Stifmeister!

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.266
Ch!

01:00:23.350 --> 01:00:24.351
Bluck!

01:00:24.768 --> 01:00:25.985
Chester!

01:00:29.064 --> 01:00:30.782
What have you
cock-smokers been up to?

01:00:30.941 --> 01:00:33.239
Well, we just got engaged.
Yeah.

01:00:33.401 --> 01:00:35.904
What? That's so fucking gay.

01:00:37.781 --> 01:00:40.034
Yeah, Stifler, we are gay.

01:00:40.534 --> 01:00:41.956
Half the lacrosse team was gay.

01:00:42.035 --> 01:00:44.163
You must have
known that, right?

01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:46.836
Dude, you walked in on Doug
and Barry in the shower.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:00:49.884
I just thought
they were wrestling.

01:00:56.377 --> 01:00:57.378
Oh.

01:01:01.715 --> 01:01:03.763
Are we sure this is Stifler's?

01:01:04.385 --> 01:01:05.386
Ooh!

01:01:05.469 --> 01:01:06.812
Hors d'oeuvres!

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.556
Why don't you give
this to our host, son?

01:01:10.558 --> 01:01:11.559
Hmm.

01:01:12.226 --> 01:01:14.570
Oh, my God! Look who it is.

01:01:14.687 --> 01:01:15.779
Hey.

01:01:17.898 --> 01:01:19.320
Sorry for interrupting
you guys last night.

01:01:19.775 --> 01:01:21.652
Bravo, by the way.

01:01:21.819 --> 01:01:24.572
Most wives stop doing that
after they get the ring.

01:01:24.738 --> 01:01:26.581
What are you talking about?
Did you change your hair color?

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:32.088
So, is your buddy, the other
MILF guy, here tonight?

01:01:32.246 --> 01:01:34.089
I thought you always come
to these things together.

01:01:34.915 --> 01:01:38.920
Let's just say that friendship
is a two-way street.

01:01:40.462 --> 01:01:41.964
Excuse me.

01:01:44.133 --> 01:01:45.134
Mmm.

01:01:45.426 --> 01:01:47.303
Could this party get any lamer?

01:01:48.345 --> 01:01:49.938
It's not so bad.

01:01:51.432 --> 01:01:53.105
You want some E?

01:01:53.267 --> 01:01:54.985
No. Why do you have that?

01:01:55.436 --> 01:01:57.814
No one else here
probably has any.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.027
Are you sure you
don't want one?

01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.191
Yeah.

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:01.488
No... Yes.

01:02:01.567 --> 01:02:02.568
No.

01:02:02.651 --> 01:02:04.824
Okay. Fine. More for me, then.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.623
And there they are.

01:02:11.785 --> 01:02:12.957
Finchy.

01:02:13.996 --> 01:02:17.500
There you guys are. Look around.
Can you believe this shit?

01:02:17.666 --> 01:02:19.464
Yeah, man. Nice work.

01:02:19.627 --> 01:02:21.049
For you.

01:02:21.128 --> 01:02:22.880
What the hell am I
supposed to do with this?

01:02:23.047 --> 01:02:24.515
That's called wine, Stifler.

01:02:24.673 --> 01:02:26.300
No, no, no, no,
not at my party.

01:02:26.383 --> 01:02:27.680
I'm going to get us some shots.

01:02:29.094 --> 01:02:30.141
Hey, Kev.

01:02:30.221 --> 01:02:31.814
Can I talk to you
guys for a sec?

01:02:32.139 --> 01:02:34.141
Yeah, sure. Wait here,
I'll be right back.

01:02:36.310 --> 01:02:37.857
So, you brought the goods?

01:02:38.062 --> 01:02:39.314
Right here.

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.027
I want to see.

01:02:43.484 --> 01:02:46.488
What the...
Where did those fuckers go?

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:47.821
Hello, Steven.

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:50.162
Mr. Levenstein. Yes.

01:02:50.241 --> 01:02:51.333
You made it.

01:02:51.492 --> 01:02:54.120
It is so great to see
all you kids back in town.

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.250
Hmm.

01:02:55.329 --> 01:02:58.708
And what a terrific soiree
you're throwing here tonight.

01:02:58.874 --> 01:03:00.717
Just wonderful!

01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:04.551
You know what?
I'm going to get you fucked up.

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:05.927
Hmm? Have a shot.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:07.683
Oh! No, no, no.

01:03:07.841 --> 01:03:11.220
I don't think so, Steven.
I'm not much of a drinker.

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:13.355
Drink it. Drink it!
Drink it! No, I can't.

01:03:13.514 --> 01:03:14.936
Drink it! Drink it!

01:03:17.017 --> 01:03:18.109
Awesome! Let's do another one.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:19.357
I don't think so.

01:03:19.436 --> 01:03:21.780
Look, Kev, you don't know for
sure if anything happened.

01:03:21.855 --> 01:03:25.200
I woke up next to her in bed,
and all our clothes were off.

01:03:25.359 --> 01:03:28.033
I mean, whatever happened,
I feel guilty.

01:03:28.195 --> 01:03:29.868
Kevin, in France,

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:33.705
it's only considered cheating if
your wife catches you in the act.

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.080
She's here.

01:03:40.374 --> 01:03:41.796
I gotta go.

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.711
All right, get ready.

01:03:43.877 --> 01:03:46.346
Wait for it. Wait for it!

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.469
Wait for it!

01:03:47.548 --> 01:03:49.095
Here she comes!

01:03:49.508 --> 01:03:50.555
Yeah!

01:03:50.634 --> 01:03:52.386
Fuck yeah, Mr. Levenstein!

01:03:52.553 --> 01:03:54.681
The name is Noah, motherfucker.

01:03:57.891 --> 01:03:58.892
Mmm.

01:03:59.059 --> 01:04:00.402
Feel the sofa.

01:04:00.561 --> 01:04:03.235
It's so smooth.

01:04:03.731 --> 01:04:06.575
It feels like a Smurf's ass.

01:04:06.734 --> 01:04:08.077
Did you feel it?

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:11.284
Okay. Mia, can you...

01:04:12.781 --> 01:04:14.749
Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.

01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:15.951
Hi.

01:04:16.994 --> 01:04:20.089
Hey, I got a treat for everybody.
I picked something up.

01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:22.921
<i>Celebrity Dance Off, Season Six.
My man, Chris Ostreicher.</i>

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.001
Oh, my God.

01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:28.630
We have to watch this.

01:04:28.797 --> 01:04:31.471
Who wants to see my
baby shake his booty?

01:04:33.093 --> 01:04:34.561
I know I do.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:37.064
JDate? You have
to be kidding me.

01:04:37.222 --> 01:04:40.476
If you want quality vag, you
have to go out into the wild.

01:04:40.642 --> 01:04:41.894
"Vag"?

01:04:42.770 --> 01:04:44.613
What is that, a half a vagina?

01:04:46.065 --> 01:04:48.944
You know, in my day
we called it a beaver.

01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:52.955
And let me tell you something,
I snagged a pelt or two.

01:04:53.113 --> 01:04:54.160
I bet you did.

01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:55.282
Dad?

01:04:55.366 --> 01:04:57.789
Hey, Jim, your dad is so
much cooler than you.

01:04:57.868 --> 01:04:59.541
Stifler, please stop
getting my dad drunk.

01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.964
No, he's just trying
to get me some vag.

01:05:02.039 --> 01:05:03.040
Okay, come on.

01:05:03.123 --> 01:05:04.796
Yeah! Hey, hey.

01:05:04.958 --> 01:05:06.631
Let the man make
his own decisions.

01:05:06.794 --> 01:05:07.841
Stop. Come on.

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.921
Don't listen to him.

01:05:09.588 --> 01:05:11.932
I want you to dust off
that old dick of yours,

01:05:12.091 --> 01:05:14.093
go out there, and get some ass.

01:05:14.259 --> 01:05:15.431
Oh! Just go out there.

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:16.637
I think I Will.

01:05:16.804 --> 01:05:19.603
Dad, stop, okay?
It's exactly what I'm gonna...

01:05:19.681 --> 01:05:22.355
I'm sorry, but you have had a
little too much to drink tonight,

01:05:22.476 --> 01:05:23.728
and I'm not letting you...
No, no.

01:05:23.811 --> 01:05:27.190
No, son, I haven't...
I hardly had one drink.

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:29.654
And you know I love you.

01:05:29.817 --> 01:05:34.038
I do love you, but you need to

01:05:35.447 --> 01:05:36.448
chillax.

01:05:37.032 --> 01:05:39.126
"Chillax"?
Dad, where are you going?

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:40.669
Do you see him? Jim! Jim!

01:05:40.828 --> 01:05:42.501
Let him go.
Let him have some fun.

01:05:43.664 --> 01:05:47.339
And now we can have some fun.

01:05:48.544 --> 01:05:49.545
Come on.

01:05:51.338 --> 01:05:52.806
Excuse me.

01:05:52.965 --> 01:05:54.842
I'm sorry, excuse me.

01:05:55.008 --> 01:05:56.100
Is this a washroom?

01:05:57.553 --> 01:05:59.601
It doesn't even occur to you
that you're self-centered

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.604
because you are so
self-centered and...

01:06:02.683 --> 01:06:04.560
You know what?
Hold on a second.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.646
Can I help you?

01:06:09.189 --> 01:06:10.566
Who might you be?

01:06:10.732 --> 01:06:12.359
I'm Stifler's mom.

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.861
Oh.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.201
I'm Jim's dad.

01:06:17.531 --> 01:06:19.033
Later, fucker.

01:06:37.885 --> 01:06:41.014
Oh, my God, this is the most
ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

01:06:48.479 --> 01:06:50.356
Dude, you have an amazing body!

01:06:50.439 --> 01:06:54.910
<i>Everybody, raise the roof
for Chris Ostreicher!</i>

01:06:54.985 --> 01:06:56.987
<i>You have really been
bringing it all season long.</i>

01:06:57.070 --> 01:07:01.576
<i>But now it's time, Chris, to see if
America thinks you done brought it.</i>

01:07:02.242 --> 01:07:03.664
<i>You ready? Let's do it.</i>

01:07:03.744 --> 01:07:04.745
<i>Let's see the results.</i>

01:07:10.876 --> 01:07:13.595
What?
Gilbert Gottfried and not you?

01:07:13.754 --> 01:07:14.880
Fucking bullshit!

01:07:15.047 --> 01:07:17.175
<i>Chris, I'm so sorry, man.</i>

01:07:17.341 --> 01:07:21.938
<i>Well, we saw you jam.
Now, it's time to scram.</i>

01:07:22.888 --> 01:07:24.185
<i>Do you have any last
thoughts for the audience?</i>

01:07:24.348 --> 01:07:26.851
Okay, guys, we can
probably end it there.

01:07:27.017 --> 01:07:29.270
What? No, are you kidding?
I haven't seen this.

01:07:29.436 --> 01:07:31.780
<i>I think what I've
learned is to be true</i>

01:07:31.855 --> 01:07:32.947
<i>to myself,</i>

01:07:33.106 --> 01:07:36.110
<i>because that's what
dancing is, it's truth.</i>

01:07:36.276 --> 01:07:38.370
<i>And maybe,</i>

01:07:38.612 --> 01:07:41.786
<i>if we just danced
a little bit more,</i>

01:07:41.949 --> 01:07:45.328
<i>there would be no more wars.</i>

01:07:47.204 --> 01:07:48.626
<i>No more war!</i>

01:07:48.705 --> 01:07:51.003
Well, that is a thoughtful
take on foreign policy.

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:55.004
<i>Stick around. Hulk Hogan gets
jiggy-friggy, right after this.</i>

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:56.467
<i>You don't want to miss this.
Stick around.</i>

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:06.519
Hey.

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:08.984
If you want my opinion,
I think you got cheated.

01:08:11.061 --> 01:08:12.233
Are you okay?

01:08:13.146 --> 01:08:14.819
You know,

01:08:15.566 --> 01:08:18.569
when you lose something that's important
to you, it doesn't feel very good.

01:08:19.194 --> 01:08:21.412
Oz, it's just a show.

01:08:22.029 --> 01:08:24.578
I'm not talking about the show.

01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:33.667
Hey, Heather,
you down there?

01:08:34.292 --> 01:08:35.761
Um, coming!

01:08:36.795 --> 01:08:38.171
Oh, my God.

01:08:38.337 --> 01:08:39.635
Wait here, I'll be right back.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.473
I can't tell you how many times
I walked into Steven's room

01:08:43.635 --> 01:08:46.479
and I caught him in the
middle of sex with some girl.

01:08:46.638 --> 01:08:49.437
At least he was with
a real, live human girl.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:50.817
What are you talking about?

01:08:50.892 --> 01:08:55.022
I walked into the kitchen once,
and I saw Jim humping a pie.

01:08:57.107 --> 01:09:00.737
He turned the damn thing into a
crumble in about two seconds.

01:09:05.448 --> 01:09:07.042
I can top that.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.417
I once walked into my bedroom

01:09:08.493 --> 01:09:11.872
and I caught Steven sticking
my hairbrush up his ass.

01:09:15.626 --> 01:09:17.799
No, and it wasn't
the handle side, either.

01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:22.341
Oh!

01:09:23.716 --> 01:09:26.060
No, no, no.

01:09:27.554 --> 01:09:31.979
A pretty lady like you shouldn't
be drinking quite so much.

01:09:32.768 --> 01:09:34.111
And neither should I.

01:09:40.734 --> 01:09:42.077
How about a joint, then?

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:49.243
We don't have to wait 13 years
to see each other again.

01:09:49.408 --> 01:09:51.002
Yeah, true.

01:09:51.161 --> 01:09:55.132
And I guess I could come along
on one of your adventures.

01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:58.169
Am I good sidekick material?

01:09:58.251 --> 01:09:59.298
Sidekick?

01:09:59.378 --> 01:10:04.350
I think you are a lot more
than sidekick material.

01:10:10.097 --> 01:10:11.940
Is everything okay?

01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:16.603
It's better than ever.

01:10:19.439 --> 01:10:20.486
Mmm. Mmm.

01:10:20.565 --> 01:10:21.908
Okay, wait, wait.

01:10:22.067 --> 01:10:25.913
I don't think we're dressed
appropriately for the occasion.

01:10:26.071 --> 01:10:27.618
Put that on.

01:10:27.781 --> 01:10:29.124
Wait, where are you going?

01:10:29.199 --> 01:10:32.123
To change. Be back soon.

01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:43.846
Dudes!

01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:47.225
What's up, bro?

01:10:48.176 --> 01:10:50.144
Big Stiffy?

01:10:50.303 --> 01:10:52.397
Blowjob Lipstein.

01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:58.149
Oh, you have to be
fucking kidding me!

01:10:58.353 --> 01:10:59.479
Excuse me?

01:11:06.194 --> 01:11:07.241
Okay.

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:11.037
What the hell are you doing?
You just expect me to blow you?

01:11:11.116 --> 01:11:12.163
Yeah!

01:11:12.325 --> 01:11:13.702
I'm out of here.

01:11:13.869 --> 01:11:15.371
Wait. Wait, Wait!

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:17.005
Look, I get it.

01:11:17.164 --> 01:11:18.837
You're self-conscious
about your body.

01:11:19.541 --> 01:11:22.385
Don't worry. I was going to
shut the lights off anyway.

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:25.172
You are the same douchebag
that you were in high school.

01:11:25.672 --> 01:11:29.393
You just expect me to do
everything while I get nothing?

01:11:29.551 --> 01:11:30.552
Later.

01:11:30.635 --> 01:11:31.852
No, no!

01:11:36.016 --> 01:11:37.893
Let's make a deal.

01:11:39.186 --> 01:11:42.565
I'll get you off,
you get me off.

01:11:42.731 --> 01:11:44.608
What do you say?

01:11:44.941 --> 01:11:46.193
Fine.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.703
But I am putting you to work.

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:50.447
Holy shit.

01:11:51.615 --> 01:11:53.367
Chow time!

01:11:56.787 --> 01:11:58.664
There you are!

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:01.546
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:12:01.708 --> 01:12:04.302
Listen, we really need to...

01:12:06.046 --> 01:12:07.548
What are you doing?

01:12:07.714 --> 01:12:09.136
Taking what's mine.

01:12:11.718 --> 01:12:14.392
No, I just wanted to hear
the sound of your voice.

01:12:14.679 --> 01:12:17.228
Aw, is everything okay?
You seem stressed.

01:12:17.641 --> 01:12:19.268
Stressed?

01:12:21.102 --> 01:12:22.900
There you are!

01:12:24.397 --> 01:12:26.445
No, no, no.

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:30.329
I have to go right now, but I'll
call you back in a little bit.

01:12:30.487 --> 01:12:33.741
<i>Okay. And don't worry, I won't
watch Gossip Girl without you.</i>

01:12:33.865 --> 01:12:34.832
<i>I miss you, babe.</i>

01:12:34.908 --> 01:12:36.330
I miss you, too.

01:12:39.746 --> 01:12:43.250
Listen, Vicky,
about last night,

01:12:44.125 --> 01:12:45.422
that wasn't me.

01:12:45.585 --> 01:12:47.679
With what happened...

01:12:48.338 --> 01:12:50.932
I don't know.
It might be normal in your world.

01:12:51.091 --> 01:12:52.843
What do you think happened?

01:12:53.301 --> 01:12:55.645
Well, all our clothes
were on the floor.

01:12:55.804 --> 01:12:57.101
Yeah, because
they were soaking wet

01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.853
from when you got drunk
and fell in the lake.

01:12:59.015 --> 01:13:00.517
I took care of you.

01:13:00.684 --> 01:13:03.528
So, we didn't have sex?

01:13:03.687 --> 01:13:04.813
Of course not.

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:07.448
Oh, thank God!

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:12.704
I'm glad you think
so highly of me.

01:13:13.738 --> 01:13:14.785
No.

01:13:15.282 --> 01:13:16.875
Vicky, wait.

01:13:17.868 --> 01:13:20.963
Oh, yeah!
Oh, my God!

01:13:21.121 --> 01:13:22.623
Mia, stop.

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:25.634
9l", my God, yeah!

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.009
Mia, get off!

01:13:27.085 --> 01:13:28.962
I'm about to! I'm about to!

01:13:31.214 --> 01:13:32.306
Heather.

01:13:34.634 --> 01:13:35.681
What the hell?

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:38.476
You have something going on
with this skank?

01:13:39.973 --> 01:13:42.647
Who are you calling a
skank, you fucking bitch?

01:13:43.184 --> 01:13:44.902
Whoa! Whoa!

01:13:45.353 --> 01:13:46.525
Stop it! Stop!

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:47.689
Stop it!

01:13:49.316 --> 01:13:51.068
OW! What the fuck?

01:13:51.234 --> 01:13:53.407
That's my extension, you bitch!

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:55.197
You motherfucker!

01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:57.616
No, Mia! Wait a minute!

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.837
By the way,
I fucked Mario Lopez!

01:14:06.333 --> 01:14:07.334
Ooh...

01:14:10.253 --> 01:14:12.847
Okay, it's my turn now.

01:14:13.006 --> 01:14:15.509
Uh-uh. Not this time.

01:14:15.675 --> 01:14:17.473
Wait, what about our deal?

01:14:17.636 --> 01:14:21.231
Now you know how it
feels, Big Stiffy.

01:14:28.396 --> 01:14:29.739
Gross!

01:14:54.081 --> 01:14:57.335
You didn't actually think I'd
fall asleep again, did you?

01:14:57.501 --> 01:14:59.344
As long as you're mine,
I'm happy.

01:14:59.503 --> 01:15:01.221
Jesus, Kara.
What are you doing here?

01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.553
Your creepy friend invited
me and all my girlfriends.

01:15:03.715 --> 01:15:06.093
Nice outfit, by the way.
Very kinky.

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:08.016
Oh, shit.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:10.439
Don't worry. I locked it.

01:15:13.016 --> 01:15:14.313
Oh, Jesus.

01:15:17.938 --> 01:15:20.987
What the hell kind of freaky
shit is going on in here?

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.401
AJ, what are you doing here?

01:15:22.567 --> 01:15:24.444
I followed you.
I had to see it with my own eyes.

01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:28.241
First you fuck with my jet ski,
then you fuck my girlfriend?

01:15:28.407 --> 01:15:30.660
No! God, no! Nothing happened.

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:31.918
You're going down, Sandler.

01:15:32.035 --> 01:15:33.503
Sandler? What the...

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.130
Jesus Christ!

01:15:37.207 --> 01:15:38.550
I'm going to kill you!

01:15:40.377 --> 01:15:42.550
Jim, what the fuck
are you wearing?

01:15:42.713 --> 01:15:45.136
Hey, I can explain
everything! Jesus!

01:15:45.924 --> 01:15:46.971
Come on! Shit!

01:15:47.092 --> 01:15:48.639
Get up, gimp!

01:15:48.802 --> 01:15:50.804
Come on, I'm not
fighting you, okay?

01:15:50.929 --> 01:15:52.476
This is silly. I'm an adult.

01:15:52.639 --> 01:15:53.686
Oh, really?

01:15:53.807 --> 01:15:55.775
Because to me you look
like a little bitch pussy.

01:15:56.935 --> 01:15:58.687
Don't be a pussy, Jim.

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:01.448
Look, AJ, just calm down, okay?

01:16:01.606 --> 01:16:04.701
What makes you little fuckers think you can
crash one of the Stifmeister's parties?

01:16:05.402 --> 01:16:08.246
Did you just refer to yourself
as "the Stifmeister"?

01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:11.534
Because that's the
lamest name ever!

01:16:14.119 --> 01:16:16.247
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:16:16.413 --> 01:16:17.380
Bring it on.

01:16:17.456 --> 01:16:18.958
Hey, Steve, come on, this is...

01:16:24.296 --> 01:16:26.048
Where do you think
you're going?

01:16:30.969 --> 01:16:33.688
Don't mess with
the Class of '99, bitch!

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.062
Finch!

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:37.897
Don't hurt my friend!

01:16:52.824 --> 01:16:53.825
Hey!

01:16:54.117 --> 01:16:57.166
Get off my husband,
you little piece of shit!

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:12.095
Oh, crap! It's the fuzz!

01:17:12.844 --> 01:17:15.063
We have to get out.
How do you get out?

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.480
I need an escape route!

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.233
Oh, shit!

01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:19.397
You want to be with him?

01:17:19.476 --> 01:17:22.104
Fine! He's all yours.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.692
Come on, man!

01:17:25.690 --> 01:17:28.068
Jim, what's going on?

01:17:28.235 --> 01:17:30.283
I am so sorry for all
of this. I can explain.

01:17:30.987 --> 01:17:33.285
Last night I ran into
Kara, our neighbor.

01:17:33.490 --> 01:17:36.539
She was too drunk to drive,
so I drove her home.

01:17:36.701 --> 01:17:41.502
And she started taking off her
clothes, and touching my...

01:17:41.832 --> 01:17:45.257
Okay, I know it doesn't sound
good, but nothing happened, okay?

01:17:45.418 --> 01:17:47.512
I don't care about her at all!

01:17:47.671 --> 01:17:50.220
Thanks a lot.

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:53.135
No, no, Kara, wait.
I didn't mean...

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.019
Wait, Michelle.
Hold on, hold on.

01:17:55.178 --> 01:17:56.600
It's not what you think, okay?

01:17:56.763 --> 01:18:01.269
I swear, I was just trying to
do the right thing, and I...

01:18:01.351 --> 01:18:03.979
You have to believe
me, Michelle, please.

01:18:04.896 --> 01:18:08.025
Whether I believe you or not,

01:18:08.233 --> 01:18:09.610
I'm disappointed.

01:18:10.026 --> 01:18:12.495
I'm going to stay
with my grandmother.

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.655
Hold it, Michelle.

01:18:13.738 --> 01:18:14.739
No, Jim.

01:18:15.365 --> 01:18:16.912
Hey, the fight's over, guys.

01:18:17.075 --> 01:18:18.497
We're not here to stop a fight.

01:18:18.743 --> 01:18:21.087
We're here about
that stolen motorcycle.

01:18:21.246 --> 01:18:22.919
Looks like the VIN
numbers match up.

01:18:23.081 --> 01:18:24.333
Paul Finch.

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:26.251
You're under arrest.

01:18:27.586 --> 01:18:28.838
Awesome!

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.343
Excuse me, officer.

01:18:30.422 --> 01:18:32.698
He won that bike betting on
the World Cup in Argentina.

01:18:32.699 --> 01:18:34.973
You made some sort of mistake.

01:18:35.051 --> 01:18:37.019
Paul, what's going on?
What is this about?

01:18:37.304 --> 01:18:38.476
Paul.

01:18:38.638 --> 01:18:39.935
Finch, just tell them.

01:18:40.098 --> 01:18:41.270
Paul!

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:46.021
Hey, shitbreak, when you're
getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,

01:18:46.188 --> 01:18:47.314
think of Kevin.

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.361
Michelle, can I just... Please!

01:18:57.282 --> 01:18:58.329
Oh!

01:18:59.075 --> 01:19:00.122
Ah!

01:19:00.994 --> 01:19:02.246
Dad? Ah!

01:19:06.791 --> 01:19:07.792
Dad?

01:19:08.710 --> 01:19:10.132
Dad, what are you doing?

01:19:10.295 --> 01:19:13.048
You didn't see me!
I'm not here!

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:14.387
I'm not here!

01:19:15.967 --> 01:19:17.139
Is he all right?

01:19:17.802 --> 01:19:19.475
I don't know.

01:19:19.971 --> 01:19:21.473
What are we going
to do about Finch?

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:23.893
Fuck Finch. Let him
spend the night in jail.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:25.276
Come on, Stifler!

01:19:25.352 --> 01:19:26.569
Some friend you are.

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.365
What about you guys?

01:19:30.565 --> 01:19:33.614
You don't call me,
you don't e-mail,

01:19:33.693 --> 01:19:35.821
you don't comment
on my Facebook page.

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:38.202
You guys didn't even let me know you
were coming back for the reunion.

01:19:38.365 --> 01:19:41.665
Because we knew, somehow, you would
find a way to screw things up.

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.833
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.

01:19:43.995 --> 01:19:45.588
I wanted us to have
a fucking fun time

01:19:45.664 --> 01:19:47.166
this weekend,
like we did in high school.

01:19:47.332 --> 01:19:49.334
But we're not in
high school any more.

01:19:49.501 --> 01:19:51.003
You are so trapped
in the past, Stifler.

01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:54.218
When are you going to realize that things
will never be the way they used to be?

01:20:01.346 --> 01:20:02.563
Fine.

01:20:03.765 --> 01:20:05.563
Guess the party's over.

01:20:07.852 --> 01:20:09.104
Dicks.

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:43.934
Well, that was a great party.

01:20:44.389 --> 01:20:46.767
I honestly think I had fun.

01:20:48.727 --> 01:20:51.446
Well, that makes one of us.

01:20:53.773 --> 01:20:55.116
Have you heard from Michelle?

01:20:55.275 --> 01:20:58.529
No. She doesn't
want to talk to me.

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:00.618
What about the reunion tonight?

01:21:00.697 --> 01:21:02.825
She said she may
or may not come.

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:04.789
What's going on with you two?

01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:06.498
Jim, is there anything
you want to talk about?

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:11.712
Okay.

01:21:12.459 --> 01:21:13.585
Um...

01:21:14.794 --> 01:21:17.388
How often

01:21:17.547 --> 01:21:20.892
did you and Mom...

01:21:24.054 --> 01:21:25.351
You know?

01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:27.524
Is that what this is about?

01:21:27.599 --> 01:21:29.442
You and Michelle
haven't been...

01:21:29.601 --> 01:21:31.444
Not lately, no.

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.566
Oh...

01:21:35.106 --> 01:21:36.949
Is it

01:21:37.108 --> 01:21:38.610
an erectile problem?

01:21:39.444 --> 01:21:43.790
Because sometimes you
can buy a little time

01:21:43.948 --> 01:21:45.245
with a well-placed thumb.

01:21:45.325 --> 01:21:47.202
Oh, God. I'm just saying.

01:21:47.285 --> 01:21:49.162
I don't think that's it.
That's not it?

01:21:49.454 --> 01:21:54.255
Oh! That's something to keep in your
back pocket, because that's a no-fail.

01:21:54.417 --> 01:21:56.090
Okay, let's be done with that.

01:21:56.252 --> 01:21:59.677
No, things in that
department were fine.

01:22:00.882 --> 01:22:02.976
And then Evan was born

01:22:03.176 --> 01:22:06.055
and we kind of stopped.

01:22:06.304 --> 01:22:10.150
And they haven't really
picked up since, you know?

01:22:10.934 --> 01:22:14.188
This is not a problem,
so do not worry.

01:22:14.312 --> 01:22:16.155
You understand?
Yeah, listen, Jim.

01:22:16.314 --> 01:22:17.782
Before you were born,

01:22:17.857 --> 01:22:20.827
your mother and I,
we would do it every day.

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:21.903
I don't need this.

01:22:21.986 --> 01:22:24.330
Sometimes two or
three times a day.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:28.001
This is back in the '70s.
A lot of experimentation was going on.

01:22:28.201 --> 01:22:32.923
Your mother favored something she
called, "diving for dollars."

01:22:33.164 --> 01:22:36.043
Holy shit. I'm sorry,
I don't need...

01:22:36.126 --> 01:22:38.504
That's fine, we can...

01:22:38.670 --> 01:22:39.922
I don't have to
go on with that.

01:22:40.004 --> 01:22:45.477
But my point is, when you have a
kid, you become a dad and a mom.

01:22:45.844 --> 01:22:50.065
But it's very important not to
stop being a husband and a wife.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:54.190
And if you do that,
the sex will come.

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:57.739
That actually
makes a lot of sense.

01:22:57.897 --> 01:23:01.276
But you can't just wait for
the two of you to be alone.

01:23:01.443 --> 01:23:04.913
You have to make
your own alone time.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:08.788
Why do you think you went to
Hebrew school three times a week?

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:12.955
Sundays, noon to three?
Tuesdays, four to seven?

01:23:13.079 --> 01:23:14.376
Okay, I get it, Dad.

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:16.675
If you get it,
then why the questions?

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:17.925
I'm sorry.

01:23:18.001 --> 01:23:20.095
You're going through this, I am sorry.
I should be listening.

01:23:20.253 --> 01:23:23.257
No, I'm overreacting.
I'm sorry.

01:23:27.093 --> 01:23:28.811
Thank you.

01:23:29.345 --> 01:23:31.268
Again. Really.

01:23:34.684 --> 01:23:35.936
Anytime.

01:23:40.773 --> 01:23:42.366
Welcome, you guys.

01:23:42.442 --> 01:23:45.992
Listen, find your nametag, find
out what table you're sitting at.

01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:48.323
Ashley, so good to see you!
Oh, my God.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:51.539
Billy! Oh, my God,
you're looking so svelte.

01:23:51.701 --> 01:23:54.830
You used to be morbidly obese.
I was concerned.

01:23:54.913 --> 01:23:56.005
Hey.

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.172
He)', guys.

01:23:57.248 --> 01:23:58.921
Hey, Jim. Oz.

01:23:59.209 --> 01:24:00.381
Where is Mia?

01:24:00.460 --> 01:24:02.588
She flew out this morning.

01:24:02.754 --> 01:24:05.098
Oh. I'm sorry, man.

01:24:05.924 --> 01:24:06.971
What about Michelle?

01:24:08.218 --> 01:24:10.095
I am not sure yet.

01:24:10.803 --> 01:24:12.100
ALL; Finch!

01:24:12.305 --> 01:24:15.650
What happened? I called the police
department a thousand times.

01:24:15.725 --> 01:24:20.606
I appreciate that, Kevin.
But my mom, actually, bailed me out.

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:23.859
Guys, I screwed up.

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:26.119
That bike belongs to my boss.

01:24:26.277 --> 01:24:30.623
And I was promised a raise,
and I didn't get it, so I

01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:31.992
simply borrowed it.

01:24:32.784 --> 01:24:35.287
The truth is that my life
isn't interesting at all.

01:24:35.787 --> 01:24:39.792
I am an assistant manager at a
Staples in Bayonne, New Jersey.

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:43.261
I lied to my best friends,
and I'm sorry.

01:24:44.671 --> 01:24:47.766
You know, Finch,
just because you sold out

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.844
and got a boring job
like most of us,

01:24:50.927 --> 01:24:52.554
that doesn't mean you
should be embarrassed.

01:24:52.637 --> 01:24:55.231
Yeah, come on, man.
None of that shit matters.

01:24:56.307 --> 01:24:57.559
That means a lot, gentlemen.

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:59.102
What about your arm?

01:24:59.185 --> 01:25:00.186
Oh.

01:25:01.813 --> 01:25:04.566
I spilled coffee on myself
while I was driving.

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:05.904
No.

01:25:06.651 --> 01:25:08.324
It hurt like a bitch, though.

01:25:08.444 --> 01:25:11.288
I'll bet. Jesus, Finch.

01:25:11.656 --> 01:25:14.079
Oh, hey, check this
out, you guys.

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:17.504
Crazy, huh? Look at us.

01:25:17.662 --> 01:25:18.834
A lot of memories.

01:25:20.832 --> 01:25:22.459
"Steve Stifler."

01:25:23.418 --> 01:25:26.342
"Hopes to keep the party
going with his boys."

01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.052
Any sign of him yet?

01:25:32.218 --> 01:25:33.936
I don't think
he's going to show.

01:25:49.485 --> 01:25:50.702
Stifler?

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:55.874
How'd you find me?

01:25:56.034 --> 01:25:57.377
We asked your mom.

01:25:58.202 --> 01:26:00.705
Oh, no. I didn't do anything.

01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:06.796
We wanted to apologize
for what we said last night.

01:26:07.378 --> 01:26:08.379
We didn't mean it.

01:26:09.797 --> 01:26:13.722
Yeah, you did.
I get it, you guys think I'm a dick.

01:26:18.389 --> 01:26:20.687
Okay. Well,

01:26:21.559 --> 01:26:23.982
maybe you are kind of a dick.

01:26:24.896 --> 01:26:25.988
But,

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.733
you're a fun dick.

01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:31.949
And you're our dick.

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:37.417
Yeah, man. You were one of the biggest
reasons that high school was awesome.

01:26:37.575 --> 01:26:40.249
Yeah, high school was awesome.

01:26:40.411 --> 01:26:43.210
Then we graduated and everybody
started getting jobs

01:26:43.373 --> 01:26:45.592
and getting married
and having kids

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:48.045
and all that other stupid shit.

01:26:48.211 --> 01:26:51.886
Now, look at me.
I'm the bitch of this place.

01:26:52.090 --> 01:26:54.058
Look, Stifler, none of
our lives are perfect.

01:26:54.217 --> 01:26:55.434
Especially mine.

01:26:56.386 --> 01:27:00.766
But what do you say we keep this party
going, and hit up this reunion together?

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.568
What the hell is going on here?

01:27:05.311 --> 01:27:08.815
Oh, my God.
This is the jackass.

01:27:09.232 --> 01:27:11.701
You're not even close to being
finished and you're up here

01:27:11.776 --> 01:27:13.904
"chilling with your posse"?

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:15.245
Sorry, we can explain.

01:27:15.405 --> 01:27:16.702
No, Kevin.

01:27:18.116 --> 01:27:19.208
Allow me.

01:27:19.283 --> 01:27:21.911
Yeah, Kevin, allow him.

01:27:21.994 --> 01:27:23.211
This better be good, Stafler.

01:27:23.788 --> 01:27:25.790
It's Stifler, fucker.

01:27:26.124 --> 01:27:30.129
Oh, wow.
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:27:30.294 --> 01:27:33.798
Are you acting tough in front
of your girlfriend? Huh?

01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:35.883
Because we both know she's
only with you for your money.

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:38.061
Definitely not for your dick.

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.062
Because anybody that's
peed next to you

01:27:40.138 --> 01:27:41.981
knows it's the size of
a leprechaun's pinkie.

01:27:43.558 --> 01:27:45.560
That's not true.

01:27:45.643 --> 01:27:48.988
"That's not
true." Oh, yeah, it is.

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:54.320
Look, just because you got a fancy
office and I don't even have a desk

01:27:54.485 --> 01:27:56.783
doesn't change
who we really are.

01:27:56.946 --> 01:28:00.496
The truth is,
you're still a dork,

01:28:00.658 --> 01:28:02.581
and I can still kick your ass.

01:28:03.494 --> 01:28:05.167
But I'm not going to.

01:28:05.329 --> 01:28:06.831
You know why?

01:28:06.998 --> 01:28:08.966
Because I'm the
fucking Stifmeister.

01:28:09.167 --> 01:28:12.671
And you can take this job and
shove it up your dickhole

01:28:12.837 --> 01:28:14.965
because I have
a reunion to attend.

01:28:15.131 --> 01:28:16.303
Dudes?

01:28:22.847 --> 01:28:26.522
By the way, I had no clue what I
was doing with any of this shit,

01:28:26.684 --> 01:28:29.028
so you got a lot of work to do.

01:29:03.721 --> 01:29:05.394
Surprise! Hey! You made it.

01:29:05.556 --> 01:29:06.808
Of course.

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:08.101
What do you think about
the Lions this year?

01:29:08.102 --> 01:29:09.227
They got a shot?

01:29:09.393 --> 01:29:11.771
We'll see if their
offensive line can hold.

01:29:11.938 --> 01:29:14.566
<i>Are you planning on being on
Celebrity Dance Off: All Stars?</i>

01:29:14.732 --> 01:29:16.655
I actually haven't
thought much about that.

01:29:16.818 --> 01:29:18.866
You should think about it.

01:29:23.491 --> 01:29:26.836
I'm sorry, guys,
you'll have to excuse me.

01:29:31.415 --> 01:29:32.758
Can I cut in?

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:35.928
I don't know.
Can you promise to keep your shirt on?

01:29:36.796 --> 01:29:39.595
Come on, buddy, I'm busting balls.
Huh?

01:29:39.674 --> 01:29:41.768
Yeah, of course.

01:29:42.093 --> 01:29:43.436
I'll get us some drinks.

01:29:43.511 --> 01:29:44.637
Okay.

01:29:46.430 --> 01:29:48.979
Hey.

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:52.315
Shouldn't you be dancing
with your girlfriend?

01:29:52.478 --> 01:29:53.479
Uh...

01:29:54.605 --> 01:29:57.779
Mia and I are over.

01:29:59.277 --> 01:30:03.953
She wanted me
to be someone else.

01:30:04.490 --> 01:30:08.165
Something that I
don't want to be.

01:30:09.287 --> 01:30:11.460
What do you want, Chris?

01:30:11.956 --> 01:30:14.300
Heather, I want this.

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.006
I want us.

01:30:17.461 --> 01:30:20.965
What about your career? LA?

01:30:21.132 --> 01:30:24.432
Look, I know that it's crazy.

01:30:24.594 --> 01:30:29.350
And I don't have all the answers
right now, but I see you,

01:30:30.725 --> 01:30:32.193
and I just know

01:30:33.436 --> 01:30:34.608
I want you.

01:30:36.147 --> 01:30:37.273
I love you.

01:30:38.482 --> 01:30:39.859
I love you.

01:30:46.824 --> 01:30:47.916
So, I'm skiing down a mountain.

01:30:47.992 --> 01:30:49.335
Guy has a heart
attack right there.

01:30:49.493 --> 01:30:52.372
Saved his life.
It was a big story, you can Google it.

01:30:52.538 --> 01:30:53.664
Yeah, it was.

01:30:53.831 --> 01:30:55.174
I bet.

01:30:56.167 --> 01:30:58.340
Holy shit! Excuse me.

01:30:58.502 --> 01:31:00.925
Hey, excuse me.
What the hell is going on?

01:31:01.339 --> 01:31:02.465
Ron, I can explain.

01:31:02.548 --> 01:31:03.925
Seriously, this guy?

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:06.344
I'm a fucking heart surgeon,
this guy's not even on ESPN.

01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:08.308
Hey, take it easy, Ron.

01:31:08.471 --> 01:31:10.815
What are you going to do?
Hit me, Oz? Huh?

01:31:10.973 --> 01:31:13.897
Oh, I got an idea.
What about a dance-off? Huh?

01:31:14.852 --> 01:31:17.696
This isn't a reality show, okay?
This is the real world.

01:31:17.855 --> 01:31:21.200
You take one swing at me, I will
sue you for all you're worth.

01:31:25.655 --> 01:31:28.124
I'm not worth jack shit, Dron.

01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:31.918
I'm your dick.

01:31:34.914 --> 01:31:35.961
Dropped him!

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.041
That was awesome!

01:31:37.208 --> 01:31:39.381
Listen, we had a blast
the other night.

01:31:40.544 --> 01:31:43.013
Have you ever thought about
being a party planner?

01:31:43.547 --> 01:31:45.970
Because we want you
to plan our wedding.

01:31:46.050 --> 01:31:47.597
Say yes.

01:31:48.594 --> 01:31:50.562
Yeah, yeah! I'd love to.

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:52.436
Nice! Oh, my God.

01:31:52.598 --> 01:31:54.316
Thanks! This is great, man.

01:31:54.475 --> 01:31:57.103
Thank you so much.
Thank you, bro.

01:31:57.269 --> 01:31:58.737
You're welcome. Thank you.

01:32:04.527 --> 01:32:05.619
I have to tell you something.

01:32:05.695 --> 01:32:06.821
You don't have to explain.

01:32:07.405 --> 01:32:11.751
Look, Paul, I didn't like you
because you climbed the Alps,

01:32:11.909 --> 01:32:13.911
or killed a camel
with your bare hands.

01:32:14.245 --> 01:32:16.748
I liked you because you were
still the same good guy

01:32:16.831 --> 01:32:19.084
that was actually nice
to me in high school.

01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:20.961
I'm still that guy.

01:32:21.377 --> 01:32:23.095
I really am.

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.557
You know, the last time I
was here was for prom.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.097
I didn't have a date.

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:30.428
Neither did I.

01:32:33.097 --> 01:32:34.223
I have to get a drink.

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:35.850
What?

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.064
Was my dancing that bad?

01:32:37.143 --> 01:32:38.190
Yeah.

01:32:38.602 --> 01:32:40.275
Kev! Hey!

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:41.355
Hey, Jess!

01:32:41.439 --> 01:32:43.237
Wow. Look, you have a beard!
It looks great.

01:32:43.315 --> 01:32:45.283
Thanks. I'm kidding.

01:32:45.401 --> 01:32:47.779
Let's just get this out of the way.

01:32:47.945 --> 01:32:49.572
I'm a lesbian now, and
this is my girlfriend.

01:32:49.573 --> 01:32:51.199
This is Ingrid.

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:53.083
Good to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

01:32:53.242 --> 01:32:55.916
Lesbians? I knew it!

01:32:55.995 --> 01:32:57.793
Why don't you guys
make out and prove it.

01:32:57.955 --> 01:33:01.050
You must be Stifler.
I've heard a lot about you. Ow!

01:33:01.125 --> 01:33:02.593
Mostly negative.

01:33:02.793 --> 01:33:04.887
Cool, dude. What the fuck?

01:33:04.962 --> 01:33:06.805
Jessica, it's good to see you.

01:33:06.922 --> 01:33:08.048
No, it wasn't.

01:33:08.132 --> 01:33:09.258
What the...

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:12.470
Look, Kev, I think you
should go talk to Vicky.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.814
She's really upset over there.

01:33:15.639 --> 01:33:17.733
Yeah, thanks.

01:33:17.808 --> 01:33:19.185
Nice to meet you.

01:33:19.268 --> 01:33:21.487
Be a real man,
you have a beard now.

01:33:25.441 --> 01:33:27.409
Kevin, don't. I'm fine.

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:31.163
Come on.
I was a complete jerk last night.

01:33:31.322 --> 01:33:34.201
I was just upset that you would
think that I would do that

01:33:34.366 --> 01:33:35.993
knowing that you're married.

01:33:36.535 --> 01:33:38.208
I know you wouldn't.

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:41.965
Honestly, that was more
about me being nervous.

01:33:43.042 --> 01:33:47.138
Seeing you again, all these
old feelings came up, and...

01:33:47.296 --> 01:33:50.015
I don't know, I guess
I just felt guilty.

01:33:50.883 --> 01:33:55.059
But the fact that I still
have feelings for you

01:33:55.221 --> 01:33:57.974
just means that what
we had was special.

01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:00.017
Don't get me wrong, all right.

01:34:00.184 --> 01:34:03.484
I love Ellie
more than anything.

01:34:03.646 --> 01:34:06.149
But no matter
how much time passes

01:34:06.899 --> 01:34:08.867
you'll always be my first love.

01:34:11.904 --> 01:34:13.030
And you'll always be mine.

01:34:13.697 --> 01:34:14.744
Kev. Hey.

01:34:14.907 --> 01:34:16.875
You have to try these
cupcakes, they're awesome.

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.079
Ellie, this is Vicky.

01:34:19.328 --> 01:34:23.583
Oh, my God! The Vicky?
Kevin has told me so much about you.

01:34:23.707 --> 01:34:26.711
You're a really lucky girl.
He's a great guy.

01:34:27.962 --> 01:34:29.680
Come dance with us.
No, it's okay.

01:34:29.839 --> 01:34:32.592
Yes, come on, this is
happening. Come on.

01:35:12.256 --> 01:35:13.303
Hey.

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:15.342
Hey.

01:35:18.762 --> 01:35:19.888
My name's Jim.

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:24.022
We were in Mr. Lee's
English class together.

01:35:24.268 --> 01:35:25.315
Really?

01:35:26.103 --> 01:35:30.279
Yeah, I...
Sorry, I don't remember you.

01:35:30.482 --> 01:35:31.608
Okay.

01:35:32.818 --> 01:35:36.322
I was the kid who everyone
saw on the Internet.

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:37.698
Mmm.

01:35:37.781 --> 01:35:41.001
Sorry, you're going to
have to be more specific.

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:42.833
I pre-ejaculated twice.

01:35:42.953 --> 01:35:44.455
Oh, Jim Levenstein! Right!

01:35:44.538 --> 01:35:47.007
Levenstein.
Yeah, Jim Levenstein.

01:35:47.166 --> 01:35:49.669
Now I remember. Yeah.

01:35:50.544 --> 01:35:52.967
So, how have you been
since high school?

01:35:53.339 --> 01:35:56.138
Pretty good. Yeah, pretty good.
Let's see.

01:35:56.467 --> 01:35:57.468
Um...

01:35:57.968 --> 01:35:58.969
Oh!

01:36:01.639 --> 01:36:04.142
I married the most wonderful
woman in the world.

01:36:06.435 --> 01:36:08.153
And we have
the cutest kid ever.

01:36:09.521 --> 01:36:12.650
It sounds like
things are perfect.

01:36:13.484 --> 01:36:16.328
I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to make it perfect.

01:36:17.571 --> 01:36:21.747
And that means being the
sexiest husband possible.

01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:23.786
Really?

01:36:24.536 --> 01:36:25.879
Michelle, you look beautiful.

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:28.716
Oh, thanks.

01:36:30.042 --> 01:36:31.510
Would you like to dance?

01:36:32.086 --> 01:36:33.383
I'd love to.

01:36:49.019 --> 01:36:50.020
Whoo!

01:36:54.775 --> 01:36:55.947
Stifler.

01:36:56.193 --> 01:36:58.787
Sherman? The Sherminator?

01:36:59.321 --> 01:37:01.039
What the fuck
have you been up to?

01:37:01.198 --> 01:37:03.576
Married. Had a kid.

01:37:03.742 --> 01:37:05.460
And divorced.

01:37:05.869 --> 01:37:08.418
Oh! I'm sorry.

01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:09.752
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

01:37:09.832 --> 01:37:12.881
But, you know what, at least I
got to keep little Furlong.

01:37:14.044 --> 01:37:16.172
You named your kid
after Eddie Furlong?

01:37:16.547 --> 01:37:17.890
Yes, I did. You know why?

01:37:18.048 --> 01:37:21.097
Because Terminator <i>2</i> is still
the greatest film ever made.

01:37:21.719 --> 01:37:25.223
Dude, you need
to get banged bad.

01:38:00.979 --> 01:38:02.981
Okay, we have
to get out of here.

01:38:03.148 --> 01:38:05.116
It's about time. Yeah.

01:38:09.863 --> 01:38:11.080
It's a lost cause.

01:38:11.156 --> 01:38:13.909
All these women are either
married or came with dates.

01:38:15.327 --> 01:38:16.328
Hey, Loni.

01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:19.915
Dude, how would you like
to have your world blown?

01:38:31.217 --> 01:38:33.686
<i>Hasta la vista, Stifler.</i>

01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:42.525
Great, everybody's
getting laid but me.

01:38:42.687 --> 01:38:43.984
This sucks.

01:38:44.147 --> 01:38:45.945
Excuse me.

01:38:46.107 --> 01:38:47.984
Hi. Hi.

01:38:48.151 --> 01:38:51.200
I'm looking for Paul Finch.
Have you seen him anywhere?

01:38:51.363 --> 01:38:53.081
What do you want with Finch?

01:38:53.239 --> 01:38:56.334
I'm here to pick him up.
I'm his mom.

01:38:59.871 --> 01:39:01.088
Finch has a mom?

01:39:03.375 --> 01:39:06.379
I mean, you're Finch's mom?

01:39:07.212 --> 01:39:09.556
Yeah. Are you a friend of his?

01:39:09.714 --> 01:39:10.806
Oh, yeah.

01:39:11.925 --> 01:39:13.472
Paul is like my best friend.

01:39:13.635 --> 01:39:17.890
I love him so much.
More now than ever before.

01:39:18.056 --> 01:39:21.435
In fact, I can't believe we haven't met.
I'm Steven Stifler.

01:39:24.354 --> 01:39:25.480
I'm Rachel.

01:39:27.315 --> 01:39:29.363
What? What is it?

01:39:29.526 --> 01:39:33.281
I just got this feeling like something
really bad is about to happen.

01:39:33.446 --> 01:39:38.327
Don't worry.
I'll be as quiet as a church mouse.

01:39:42.914 --> 01:39:44.006
Oh, Jim!

01:39:48.044 --> 01:39:49.091
Oh!

01:39:51.506 --> 01:39:52.507
I want you so bad.

01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:54.263
Oh, you have no idea!

01:39:55.093 --> 01:39:57.141
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:39:57.303 --> 01:40:00.853
Oh, God, there it is.
I don't think I can hold it any more.

01:40:00.932 --> 01:40:01.933
Hold it in!

01:40:02.016 --> 01:40:04.064
I'm sorry, I will.

01:40:04.185 --> 01:40:05.357
I just forgot
how awesome this is.

01:40:05.478 --> 01:40:07.651
Oh, yeah, I need this.

01:40:10.442 --> 01:40:13.116
Oh, God, Michelle!
Fuck, I love you!

01:40:13.194 --> 01:40:14.446
Jim?

01:40:16.531 --> 01:40:17.532
Nadia?

01:40:19.742 --> 01:40:20.743
Hey.

01:40:21.786 --> 01:40:24.960
I'm sorry. You are busy, yes?

01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:26.882
No. Yes.

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:28.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:28.793 --> 01:40:31.797
Nadia, it's so nice to see you.

01:40:32.172 --> 01:40:34.846
But do you think you
could give us a minute?

01:40:35.008 --> 01:40:35.975
Three.

01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:37.051
Three minutes.

01:40:37.218 --> 01:40:40.848
Okay! So nice you
are still together.

01:40:40.930 --> 01:40:41.931
Aw!

01:40:42.015 --> 01:40:44.393
And I see you've gotten
much better at this.

01:40:45.101 --> 01:40:47.354
Well, thanks.

01:40:52.233 --> 01:40:54.782
That's Jim?
He looks nothing like me.

01:40:56.613 --> 01:41:01.744
You know, when I was in high
school, I dated a lacrosse player.

01:41:01.993 --> 01:41:03.870
In fact, I dated a few of them.

01:41:04.037 --> 01:41:06.039
You don't say.

01:41:06.206 --> 01:41:09.380
I always wanted Paul
to be more into sports.

01:41:09.542 --> 01:41:12.261
But he was never
that interested.

01:41:12.754 --> 01:41:14.427
You don't have to sugarcoat it.

01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:15.932
Finch was a klutz.

01:41:18.426 --> 01:41:21.350
Yeah, I guess he was, but he
did not get that from me.

01:41:21.554 --> 01:41:24.433
I was head cheerleader.

01:41:24.766 --> 01:41:27.770
And if there's anything I
learned from lacrosse players,

01:41:27.936 --> 01:41:31.486
it's that I like
to handle a stick

01:41:33.149 --> 01:41:35.698
and cradle those balls.

01:41:38.947 --> 01:41:40.164
I love you.

01:41:41.115 --> 01:41:43.413
Are you ready for me, Stifler?

01:41:47.872 --> 01:41:49.124
Oh, yeah!

01:41:50.708 --> 01:41:52.301
Let's go.

01:41:52.460 --> 01:41:54.383
Oh, Michelle.

01:41:54.546 --> 01:41:56.469
Oh, God, Michelle.

01:41:57.048 --> 01:41:59.471
You are amazing!

01:41:59.842 --> 01:42:01.310
Better than the bathtub?

01:42:01.386 --> 01:42:02.433
Much.

01:42:04.222 --> 01:42:05.849
Better than this?

01:42:06.307 --> 01:42:07.399
Ooh!

01:42:10.728 --> 01:42:12.230
Of course.

01:42:13.731 --> 01:42:15.654
Oh, take those off!

01:42:15.817 --> 01:42:17.114
We shouldn't
be doing this.

01:42:17.277 --> 01:42:18.369
Yes, we should.

01:42:18.444 --> 01:42:20.287
Oh, Stifler.

01:42:20.446 --> 01:42:21.993
Oh, Finch's mom!

01:42:23.491 --> 01:42:24.834
Call me the Stifmeister!

01:42:24.993 --> 01:42:27.416
Yeah, you are the Stifmeister.

01:42:28.913 --> 01:42:30.165
MILF?

01:42:36.838 --> 01:42:38.431
Oh, Finch's mom!

01:42:38.673 --> 01:42:39.720
MILF.

01:42:41.301 --> 01:42:42.348
MILF.

01:42:46.097 --> 01:42:47.440
Tell me I'm the best.

01:42:47.515 --> 01:42:49.188
You are the best!

01:42:50.018 --> 01:42:51.065
MILF.

01:42:52.312 --> 01:42:53.689
MILF. MILF.

01:42:55.315 --> 01:42:56.532
Oh, Finch's mom!

01:42:57.150 --> 01:43:02.156
MILF! MILF! MILF!

01:43:04.532 --> 01:43:06.000
Yes! Yes!

01:43:06.075 --> 01:43:07.497
Oh, your
son's such a dork!

01:43:07.577 --> 01:43:09.500
Stop talking about him!

01:43:11.914 --> 01:43:14.588
Well, our first reunion
is officially in the books.

01:43:14.751 --> 01:43:17.971
I don't know about you guys, but
my night ended pretty well.

01:43:18.129 --> 01:43:19.221
It was great.

01:43:19.297 --> 01:43:20.640
I had a blast.
It was unforgettable.

01:43:20.715 --> 01:43:22.433
Fuck yeah!
I jizzed like a racehorse.

01:43:23.134 --> 01:43:24.807
What happened to you at the
end of the night, Stifler?

01:43:24.886 --> 01:43:26.183
Who did you end up with?

01:43:26.262 --> 01:43:29.015
A gentleman never
kisses and tells, Jim.

01:43:31.893 --> 01:43:32.940
Guys?

01:43:35.021 --> 01:43:36.898
I'll be right back, okay?

01:43:40.818 --> 01:43:41.910
Kara!

01:43:48.451 --> 01:43:50.545
HEY-HEY...

01:43:51.329 --> 01:43:54.003
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said the other night.

01:43:54.165 --> 01:43:57.544
No, I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

01:43:57.710 --> 01:43:59.838
I can't believe the way I acted.
I'm so embarrassed.

01:43:59.921 --> 01:44:01.468
Don't be.

01:44:01.881 --> 01:44:05.181
When I was your age I was
pretty obsessed with sex, too.

01:44:05.259 --> 01:44:06.351
I know.

01:44:07.387 --> 01:44:08.479
I've seen the YouTube clip.

01:44:08.971 --> 01:44:11.440
Oh, of course you did.

01:44:11.599 --> 01:44:13.818
But, thanks for understanding.

01:44:13.976 --> 01:44:16.775
I was thinking about it,
and you're right.

01:44:16.938 --> 01:44:18.565
I should really wait
for someone special.

01:44:20.274 --> 01:44:23.278
Just, it's going to be tough
to find a guy as good as you.

01:44:26.698 --> 01:44:27.790
I'm sure you will.

01:44:34.622 --> 01:44:36.716
I feel like a whole new
man after this weekend.

01:44:36.791 --> 01:44:38.259
Kind of sucks
we have to leave, though.

01:44:38.334 --> 01:44:41.463
Not me. I'm going to take
some time off my job

01:44:41.546 --> 01:44:43.389
and stick around here
with Heather for a while.

01:44:43.464 --> 01:44:44.556
Nice!

01:44:44.632 --> 01:44:45.758
What about you, Finch?

01:44:45.842 --> 01:44:49.062
Selena and I, we're planning
a little jaunt to Europe.

01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.814
Just make sure you call your mom.
She misses you.

01:44:52.682 --> 01:44:54.059
How would you know?

01:44:55.852 --> 01:44:56.853
Oh...

01:44:59.981 --> 01:45:01.904
I guess this is it, huh?
Back to reality?

01:45:02.066 --> 01:45:03.818
We shouldn't wait
until the next reunion.

01:45:03.985 --> 01:45:07.080
We should try to get
together every year.

01:45:07.196 --> 01:45:09.824
What do you say,
until next time?

01:45:09.907 --> 01:45:12.080
Until next time.
Until next time!

01:45:21.794 --> 01:45:23.091
I fucked Finch's mom.

01:45:23.212 --> 01:45:24.509
What?

01:45:24.630 --> 01:45:25.973
What was that?

01:46:48.047 --> 01:46:49.048
Hmm?

01:46:49.715 --> 01:46:51.092
What's this?

01:46:52.426 --> 01:46:54.178
Oh, no, dean No, no, no.

01:46:54.345 --> 01:46:56.188
No, dear. No!

01:46:56.264 --> 01:46:57.265
Oh!

01:47:03.145 --> 01:47:04.146
Oh...

01:47:04.897 --> 01:47:07.946
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:47:08.192 --> 01:47:11.537
Ah. Oh. Oh.

01:47:11.946 --> 01:47:14.825
Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

01:47:15.032 --> 01:47:17.126
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:47:17.785 --> 01:47:19.378
Oh! Oh!

01:47:19.453 --> 01:47:21.501
Oh, my God!

01:47:21.873 --> 01:47:23.295
Ah!

01:47:29.213 --> 01:47:30.806
Great movie.
