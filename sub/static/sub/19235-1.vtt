02:40.827 --> 02:42.895
What's that, honey?

02:42.897 --> 02:44.530
I just woke up with it.

02:44.532 --> 02:46.331
Really?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.834
I thought maybe I would
put it to use.

02:58.545 --> 03:01.647
Oh, shit.
God damn.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.893
Grandpa?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.662
- You okay?
- Just a second.

03:27.474 --> 03:29.708
Mom! Dad!

03:29.710 --> 03:31.777
Toilet is not working again!

03:31.779 --> 03:34.713
Why can't she just use
the bathroom downstairs?

03:34.715 --> 03:38.617
Because she's a girl,
and her stuff's in there.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.252
I know.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.720
She has to get ready for school.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.657
Please,
just go look at it, please.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.259
Okay.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.596
Okay. Okay.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.597
Okay.

03:51.599 --> 03:55.567
- Okay.
- Thank you.

03:55.569 --> 03:56.969
Okay.

03:56.971 --> 03:58.537
Okay.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.015
Annie?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.817
Just fix it!

04:27.433 --> 04:29.635
Just give me a second, sweetie.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.639
Hello?!

04:33.641 --> 04:35.040
Hey, Estelle.

04:35.042 --> 04:37.943
Um, can I talk to you
and ray for a second?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.978
Yeah, let me just get decent.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.385
Okay, come on in!

04:47.954 --> 04:51.390
Hey. Happy...
Happy birthday, ray.

04:51.392 --> 04:54.960
Oh, Brian, that is so sweet
of you to remember.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.962
Oh, good heavens!
I'm hanging out here!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.864
You didn't see my nipple,
did you?

04:58.866 --> 05:00.565
No, no Ni...
No nipples.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.334
He's gonna take a minute
to find his trousers.

05:02.336 --> 05:04.002
Can't a man get any privacy?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.038
Since when did you
become so bashful?

05:06.040 --> 05:08.874
- What?
- -I said, since when

05:08.876 --> 05:10.409
did you become so bashful?

05:10.411 --> 05:11.677
Now, listen,

05:11.679 --> 05:13.478
I don't want
to embarrass anyone,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.881
but I think we all

05:15.883 --> 05:18.483
need to be
a little more conscious

05:18.485 --> 05:20.352
of what we put in the toilet.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.087
All I did was take a bath,

05:22.089 --> 05:25.023
but I suppose
I can't do that anymore

05:25.025 --> 05:27.092
without being persecuted
by my son-in-law.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.728
Nobody is pointing
any fingers, ray.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.597
It's just that that toilet
can be a little bit finicky.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.032
Yes, it is.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.368
Well, perhaps you would
like to accompany me

05:36.370 --> 05:37.836
the next time I take a bath?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.472
That won't be necessary.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.741
Are those <i> my</i> slippers?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.916
Add slippers
to the shopping list.

05:50.918 --> 05:52.451
I don't even
want to know what that means.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.486
Hey, honey?
What do you think of these?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.121
Oh, are those the new fabrics?

05:56.123 --> 05:57.622
Yeah, they're for my meeting

05:57.624 --> 05:59.091
with Stamford and Miller
tomorrow.

05:59.093 --> 06:00.759
They're actually considering
putting them

06:00.761 --> 06:02.361
in their
Armonk and Darien stores.

06:02.363 --> 06:03.662
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.397
- They look amazing.
- Thank you.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.499
- Are you on-site today?
- Uh, no, tom's coming over

06:07.501 --> 06:09.101
in a few minutes,
we're gonna go look at the...

06:09.103 --> 06:11.136
Hey, Annie! You're gonna be late
for school, sweetie!

06:11.138 --> 06:13.105
- I'm coming!
- All right.

06:13.107 --> 06:15.941
Hey, Nick called yesterday
and he want to stay

06:15.943 --> 06:18.577
- in Boise for labor day.
- You told him that was okay?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.912
I just spent $500
on Yankee tickets.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.448
You spend $500 on tickets
but you refuse to put

06:23.450 --> 06:25.550
a decent septic system
in your house?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.886
Dad. I'm sure you can find
somebody that will go with you.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.721
Raymond, did you do something

06:29.723 --> 06:31.156
with my reading glasses?

06:31.158 --> 06:33.024
What the hell would I do
with your reading glasses?

06:33.026 --> 06:35.761
That is not the point.
This is our tradition.

06:35.763 --> 06:38.997
I mean... labor day, baseball,
father, son,

06:38.999 --> 06:41.666
- since he was eight years old.
- Yeah, but now he's 19,

06:41.668 --> 06:43.602
and he wants to stay at college
with his friends.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.003
Okay? I'm sorry.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.038
Okay, everybody,
Missy's picking me up.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.573
We're having lunch
with the girls.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.442
I will see you all
at dinner tonight.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.544
Please, please do not be late.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.112
- Annie, guess what?
- Okay.

06:54.114 --> 06:56.415
Your grandmother says it's okay
to bring that Colt kid

06:56.417 --> 06:57.916
to dinner tonight,
so there you go.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.085
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.087
We're gonna be late.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.055
- Thank you! I love you!
- Let's go, let's go.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.857
- Get off the phone. Let's go.
- Bye!

07:05.859 --> 07:07.459
- Mom, I'm coming!
- Go. Go. Go. Go.

07:07.461 --> 07:09.528
- Go. Go.
- All righty.

07:11.564 --> 07:12.931
Since you were four years old,

07:12.933 --> 07:14.833
I can't get you
out of the house on time.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.878
- Annie, get in this car!
- I'm coming!

07:26.880 --> 07:28.647
It's going on a month now.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.449
Every night this kid's
in the bed with us.

07:30.451 --> 07:32.684
- I mean, every night.
- Well, what did you expect?

07:32.686 --> 07:34.453
What do you mean,
what do I expect?

07:34.455 --> 07:37.222
I expected the kid
to be sleeping in his bed.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.224
I mean, when...
When am I gonna have sex?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.625
This kid's becoming

07:40.627 --> 07:42.027
a human chastity belt!

07:42.029 --> 07:43.829
There's other people
in the house, okay?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.664
She's somehow comfortable
with it...

07:45.666 --> 07:47.933
You're not gonna have
any more sex. It's over

07:47.935 --> 07:50.101
I almost,<i> almost</i>
had sex this morning.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.937
Hi, everything all right?

07:51.939 --> 07:53.505
They didn't come.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.906
I need you to drive me
to my appointment.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.241
- Who didn't come?
- The taxi.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.809
They said they got
the time wrong.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.611
My appointment was for 11:00.

07:59.613 --> 08:02.647
- Um, can you reschedule?
- I can't reschedule.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.549
I need to be there today.
Come on.

08:08.020 --> 08:10.155
Sorry, it's, um...

08:10.157 --> 08:11.723
His birthday, and...

08:11.725 --> 08:14.526
- He's intense.
- Oh, you have no idea.

08:14.528 --> 08:18.230
It's two <i> years</i>
since the heart attack,

08:18.232 --> 08:21.633
and Kate insists
that he stay here

08:21.635 --> 08:24.903
until he gets a full recovery,
and there is no full recovery.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.705
I don't know
how you're doing it, man.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.540
My in-laws stayed with us
for a couple weeks in June,

08:28.542 --> 08:31.276
and I was ready to, like,
fucking drive my truck

08:31.278 --> 08:33.745
off the GW
with them in the back.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.780
- Stop it!
- In a sack tied up.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.056
- Um, how are you getting home?
- I'll take a cab.

08:45.058 --> 08:47.926
Are you sure you don't want me
to come back and get you...

08:51.063 --> 08:52.564
You're welcome.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.257
Well, I'm sorry to have
to give you this news

09:19.259 --> 09:21.259
on your birthday,
Dr. Engersol.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.994
It's not your fault.

09:22.996 --> 09:27.032
All right, so, as you can see,

09:27.034 --> 09:29.634
your severe aortic stenosis
should make you

09:29.636 --> 09:31.803
a reasonable candidate
for valve replacement.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.673
However, your pre-op Cath
shows extensive blockages...

09:34.675 --> 09:37.175
We've been over this.
I just need my records.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.344
Now, there are still
surgical options.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.981
Yes. Aortic valve replacement.
Another bypass.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.784
I don't have to tell you
that a procedure on a heart

09:45.786 --> 09:47.319
- in your condition...
- No, you don't.

09:47.321 --> 09:51.189
I sat behind a desk like yours
for over 40 years.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.992
Let me ask you something.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.828
Even if I didn't code
on the table,

09:56.830 --> 09:58.863
what kind of time
do you actually think

09:58.865 --> 10:01.700
this would buy me,
six months at most?

10:03.636 --> 10:06.104
Let me make your job
easier for you, okay?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.772
I'm not having the surgery.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.307
I think that that's something

10:09.309 --> 10:11.142
you should discuss
with your wife.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.812
No, I'm not telling my wife.
I'm not telling anybody.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.281
And neither are you.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.749
They opened me up once,

10:17.751 --> 10:19.351
and they're not opening
me up again.

10:19.353 --> 10:21.186
Whatever's broken, doctor,

10:21.188 --> 10:23.355
we both know
it's not getting fixed.

10:26.125 --> 10:28.059
Ray...

10:28.061 --> 10:30.395
If you don't have
this surgery...

10:30.397 --> 10:32.697
You're going to die.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.207
And if I do have the surgery?

10:47.380 --> 10:49.814
Would you please see
that all of that is in my file?

10:49.816 --> 10:51.216
Of course.

10:53.185 --> 10:55.120
Thank you, doctor.

11:02.228 --> 11:04.262
I'll take a copy
of my file, sue.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.731
And could you dial
a number for me, please?

11:11.137 --> 11:13.705
Hello. Can I speak
to Peter, please?

11:13.707 --> 11:17.008
It's Raymond Engersol.
Thank you.

11:32.758 --> 11:35.860
Hey, Pete, it's ray.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.128
How you doing today?

11:39.031 --> 11:41.966
Oh, well, that's good to hear.

11:41.968 --> 11:46.738
Are we still set for Tuesday?
Next Tuesday?

11:46.740 --> 11:50.041
Great, I'll be there.
No, I'm coming, Peter.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.010
I've been speaking
to Dr. Feldstein about this.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.345
I've made up my mind.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.347
Okay.
I'll see you soon.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.392
And, daddy, I love you so much

12:07.394 --> 12:10.495
that I even let you order
a bacon cheeseburger

12:10.497 --> 12:12.864
at this fine establishment,
so, I'm a hero.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.399
But seriously,
happy birthday, dad.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.835
Here's to many, many,
many, many more. Cheers.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.070
- Honey?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.805
Oh, uh, cheers.
Happy birthday.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.974
Happy birthday, ray.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.976
So, Colt, tell me,
how's football going, bud?

12:24.978 --> 12:26.344
- Good, sir.
- Good.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.046
You got your first game
coming up this week.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.981
Yeah, yeah,
we're looking really great.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.050
Excellent. You gonna get
some playing time this year?

12:32.052 --> 12:34.519
- Dad.
- It's an alternating lineup.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.355
Annie, have you talked
to your brother lately?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.758
Nick's fine, he texted me that
he's doing this photo shoot

12:39.760 --> 12:41.860
off-campus with a nude couple.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.261
Really, is that
for extra credit or...

12:43.263 --> 12:44.796
- Fetish?
- Or for fun?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.397
- Stop.
- Both, knowing him.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.066
At least he calls you back.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.368
Honey, how was your
appointment today?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.470
- Raymond?
- Oh, it was fine.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.205
Who are you seeing, dad?

12:54.207 --> 12:56.441
Deb Mooney.
She's my ophthalmologist.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.909
What did she have to say?

12:57.911 --> 12:59.811
That I still can't drive.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.880
Well, you know, ray,
that assisted-living community

13:01.882 --> 13:04.249
I was talking about,
that's near the sight and rye,

13:04.251 --> 13:06.317
they have a shuttle
that goes to town every day

13:06.319 --> 13:07.919
so you don't have to worry
about driving at all.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.487
You can stay with us
as long as you want.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.055
I'm sorry, madam...

13:11.057 --> 13:13.158
Please stop talking
about assisted living.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.492
Yeah, I get it.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.493
May I suggest
the coquilles St. Jacques?

13:15.495 --> 13:17.128
What is that?

13:17.130 --> 13:19.430
I'm not experienced
with the French palette.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.166
Of course, madam.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.067
It is a shell
stuffed with scallops

13:23.069 --> 13:26.905
in a creamy white sauce
with herbs and spices.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.407
Well, that sounds very good.
I think I'll have that.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.376
Excellent choice, madam.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.044
Daddy, I saved
this article for you

13:33.046 --> 13:34.846
from <i> the Sunday times.</i>

13:34.848 --> 13:37.081
It was about the decline...

13:41.387 --> 13:43.354
Ray? Ray?

13:43.356 --> 13:46.024
What?
Oh, yes, dear.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.292
Hey, is everything okay?

13:47.294 --> 13:49.427
I'd like to say a few words.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.063
Shh, shh, Colt,
grandpa's talking.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.465
- Oh, all right.
- What is it, daddy?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.000
- Oh, shit.
- Did you forget your glasses?

13:56.002 --> 13:57.402
- I left them at the house.
- Oh, honey, i...

13:57.404 --> 13:59.003
- No, no never mind, never mind.
- I can read it...

13:59.005 --> 14:01.306
- It's okay.
- Okay.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.846
Estelle, you know I love you.
I love you very much.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.247
Oh...

14:09.249 --> 14:12.116
I love everybody
at this table very much.

14:12.118 --> 14:15.220
Well, not you.
I don't know you.

14:15.222 --> 14:18.223
I've been on this earth
for 80 years.

14:20.126 --> 14:23.962
And if I do say so myself,
I've been a very fortunate guy.

14:23.964 --> 14:27.332
I... I made something
of my life.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.167
I made something.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.073
I made something for myself.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.909
We're here tonight
to celebrate my life.

14:37.911 --> 14:41.346
You just get one shot at this,
you know.

14:41.348 --> 14:45.416
I think you just gotta take
the bad with the good.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.554
And, uh...

14:49.556 --> 14:52.123
I've become a burden
to this family.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.925
Oh, daddy, no, you're not.

14:53.927 --> 14:57.061
And I've become
a burden to myself.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.965
And one way or another,
I think that's gotta end.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.336
So, with that in mind

15:05.338 --> 15:09.474
and after giving this
a lot of thought...

15:09.476 --> 15:12.110
I would like to make
an announcement.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.614
I want to die.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.483
- What?
- Jeez, dad, stop it!

15:18.485 --> 15:21.419
It's my birthday, honey.
I can say what I want.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.621
Go on, honey.
Would you pass the bread please?

15:23.623 --> 15:25.924
- I'm going back to Oregon.
- No, you're not.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.425
What's in Oregon?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.627
We raised Annie's mother
and her uncle Danny there.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.462
- It's a cold place.
- They have laws there

15:31.464 --> 15:33.598
for people like me
who want to take their own life

15:33.600 --> 15:35.633
in their own way
and on their own terms.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.335
What do you mean, like suicide?

15:37.337 --> 15:39.704
No, honey,
they don't see it that way.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.273
The amuse-bouche this evening
is beef carpaccio.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.008
Outstanding.
Thank you very much.

15:44.010 --> 15:45.376
Your favorite, daddy.
Sit down.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.112
So, Raymond, do you plan
on flying out there?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.648
No, I don't, Estelle, I thought
maybe you would drive me.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.051
Raymond refuses to fly,
and unfortunately,

15:53.053 --> 15:54.986
I'm unable to drive
at the moment.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.421
We're an adventurous pair.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.189
I have an appointment there
next week

15:58.191 --> 15:59.691
with a specialist in this field.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.126
- Come on, he's not serious.
- I'm serious.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.195
I hired a driver.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.297
I'm leaving tomorrow.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.071
Happy birthday, ray.

16:16.642 --> 16:18.376
You're not even sick!

16:18.378 --> 16:20.211
Katherine, I'm ready to go.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.046
You know what,
if you were ready to go,

16:22.048 --> 16:23.581
- you would have gone already.
- We sold the house.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.516
Everything else goes to Estelle.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.385
She can have another life
after this.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.653
Does she have a say in this?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.221
Apparently not.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.123
I don't want to live here
anymore.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.591
And I certainly don't
want to live

16:33.593 --> 16:35.159
in Brian's retirement home.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.461
It's a living community.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.196
It's a dying community.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.131
And you want us out of here
as much as I want to go.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.266
What do you want me to do,
honey?

16:42.268 --> 16:44.035
Wait until I'm in pain
every single day?

16:44.037 --> 16:45.403
Dad, don't say that.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.105
Or get a stroke
and I'm crippled?

16:47.107 --> 16:48.773
Just stop it.

16:48.775 --> 16:54.445
I don't want to be told
how to live my life!

16:54.447 --> 16:56.614
Okay, then...
Then tell me how this works.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.117
So, you go over
the Oregon border

16:59.119 --> 17:02.720
to some Kevorkian-style lair
and, what, bam, that's it?

17:02.722 --> 17:05.123
I mean, what are we talking
about here, dad?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.157
Do you even qualify for this?

17:07.160 --> 17:09.227
He doesn't!
We don't live there anymore!

17:09.229 --> 17:11.061
I still own property there.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.131
What, the cabin?
No, that can't be enough.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.199
- It's enough.
- We should have sold that place.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.602
- It's a pain in my ass.
- It's income property!

17:17.604 --> 17:19.737
We only rented it twice
the whole year!

17:19.739 --> 17:21.739
And you know you're not
supposed to be eating

17:21.741 --> 17:24.375
- ice cream this late.
- I didn't get any at dinner!

17:24.377 --> 17:26.411
Okay, enough.
Enough. Give me this.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.481
My doctor's taking care of it.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.450
Who is this doctor, dad?
I need to talk to him right now.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.818
I don't want to live here
anymore.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.186
Who is it?! Tell me!

17:35.188 --> 17:36.320
Katherine.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.293
I don't want to live anymore.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.831
I've made arrangements.

17:46.833 --> 17:49.333
It's my life.

17:49.335 --> 17:51.402
I just want to know
what my options are.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.171
I made an appointment
for Tuesday.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.739
I am going to Oregon.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.808
- You can't block this.
- Daddy?

17:56.810 --> 17:59.777
It's not your decision to make.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.379
Ray...

18:01.381 --> 18:05.850
Daddy, no, i...
I don't... I don't...

18:05.852 --> 18:08.252
Mom? Help me here...

18:08.254 --> 18:10.521
Sounds like he's got it
all worked out.

18:12.658 --> 18:16.127
He's not going to be eligible.
He's not dying.

18:16.129 --> 18:18.830
Maybe he just needs to know
what his options are,

18:18.832 --> 18:20.631
- once and for all.
- Okay, but, you know what?

18:20.633 --> 18:23.634
I'm not having some stranger
drive him, okay?

18:23.636 --> 18:27.205
Well, who else
do you have in mind?

18:27.207 --> 18:30.541
Don't even think about it.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.155
<i>Please just calm down.</i>

18:44.157 --> 18:46.724
<i>Stop telling me
to calm down, Brian, seriously.</i>

18:46.726 --> 18:48.893
Okay, could you explain to me
one more time

18:48.895 --> 18:50.561
why it has to be you
to drive him?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.530
I don't know, maybe if my mom
could stay sober

18:52.532 --> 18:54.599
for more than five fucking
minutes maybe she could do it.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.534
But she can't, so it's me.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.635
Maybe he doesn't
want to be saved.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.137
What are you talking about?

18:59.139 --> 19:00.471
I'm just trying
to get some perspective.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.807
Why would you say that?
Look, of course he does.

19:02.809 --> 19:05.643
Do you know how many people
his age who are dead or dying

19:05.645 --> 19:07.778
would give anything to spend
more time with their family?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.747
- Come on.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.415
What? What's so funny?

19:11.417 --> 19:15.419
I'm sorry, but that
doesn't sound like ray.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.358
Yes, hello?
Yeah, this is her mother.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.228
W-what?

19:28.201 --> 19:30.434
This is absolutely the last
thing I need right now!

19:30.436 --> 19:32.470
I'm never speaking to Colt
again, isn't that enough?

19:32.472 --> 19:34.205
Not. Even. Close.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.907
Do you understand
how serious this is?

19:35.909 --> 19:38.376
You sent those pictures!
You're underage!

19:38.378 --> 19:40.478
This could have been so much
worse than a suspension!

19:40.480 --> 19:41.779
They were private pictures!

19:41.781 --> 19:43.181
Jesus, nothing in
high school is private.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.249
- Give me your phone, by the way.
- No!

19:45.251 --> 19:47.218
- Get off!
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.786
You make me feel like
I'm such a freak!

19:48.788 --> 19:50.922
- Everyone does it!
- Everyone does not do it.

19:50.924 --> 19:53.257
And even if that was true,
it does not make it all right.

19:53.259 --> 19:55.393
They weren't even that bad!
You could hardly see anything!

19:55.395 --> 19:57.562
Do you care to weigh in
on this, please?

20:12.911 --> 20:14.845
- Hey.
- -Hey.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.681
What did you tell them?

20:16.683 --> 20:19.884
I told them that
you are not going anywhere.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.520
- Okay.
- That Annie needs you here.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.289
- Yeah, what about dad?
- Well, first I told him

20:25.291 --> 20:26.958
that he's not going to get
to Oregon by Tuesday.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.526
New York to Portland
in four days?

20:28.528 --> 20:29.627
Not gonna happen.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.530
We can entertain his wolf cries

20:32.532 --> 20:34.365
when we don't have two children

20:34.367 --> 20:37.235
who are experimenting
in nude portraiture.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.003
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, baby.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.639
Why did this all
have to happen now?

20:41.641 --> 20:43.307
Why can't I just deal

20:43.309 --> 20:45.977
with one family catastrophe
at a time?

20:45.979 --> 20:48.479
Well, she's a teenager.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.249
Yeah, well,
what's his excuse, huh?

20:53.819 --> 20:57.321
I also called Danny,
and I left him a message.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.456
Why?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.924
Just...
I thought, you know,

20:59.926 --> 21:02.360
maybe he would be
the voice of reason.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.795
Why would you think that he...

21:04.797 --> 21:08.966
Danny can't take any more
of dad's shit, Brian!

21:08.968 --> 21:10.601
What are you doing?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.670
You can't just pawn
my father off on him.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.405
They don't even talk
to each other!

21:14.407 --> 21:15.773
I'm not pawning him off...

21:15.775 --> 21:17.408
He's my responsibility.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.643
I'm trying to find a solution!

21:18.645 --> 21:20.344
No! No, you're not!

21:20.346 --> 21:21.779
You're trying to get my parents
out of the house.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.447
That is exactly
what you're doing.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.283
Well, you know what,
it would be nice

21:25.285 --> 21:27.485
- to have the marriage back!
- This is our marriage, Brian!

21:27.487 --> 21:28.853
- This! All of this!
- No, no, no, no!

21:28.855 --> 21:31.555
This is not
what I signed up for!

21:31.557 --> 21:32.990
Oh, my fucking god.

21:36.662 --> 21:37.828
I'm sorry, I'm...

21:37.830 --> 21:40.731
Fuck, you're...
Oh, my god.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.343
Dad! Dad, please,
what are you doing?

21:52.345 --> 21:53.978
I don't have time to wait.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.414
I thought that you said
you cancelled the driver.

21:56.416 --> 21:59.016
I know what you're both doing.
It's not gonna work.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.385
- Brian?
- Hey, ray, ray, ray?

22:01.387 --> 22:02.887
I understand that you're upset,

22:02.889 --> 22:04.789
but you cannot do this
right now.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.925
Kate's full attention
needs to be on Annie, period.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.794
Clearly, but your daughter's
risqué habits

22:09.796 --> 22:11.529
are not gonna stop me.

22:11.531 --> 22:13.698
Listen, no, no, no,
dad, I promised you

22:13.700 --> 22:15.499
that I would take you,
just not today, all right?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.901
- Can't you understand that?
- Before we leave,

22:16.903 --> 22:18.636
I just wanted to confirm
the mileage fees.

22:18.638 --> 22:20.338
Get mom, please.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.906
If you could fill out
the method of payment form,

22:21.908 --> 22:23.574
considering your situation.

22:23.576 --> 22:25.376
It's best we handle this
on the front end.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.445
- Estelle?!
- Guy tells me to drive, I drive.

22:27.447 --> 22:29.080
I know,
but he happens to be insane.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.815
Take my dad's stuff
out of the car right now,

22:30.817 --> 22:31.982
or else I'm calling the police.

22:31.984 --> 22:33.751
- And tell them what?
- Estelle!

22:33.753 --> 22:35.820
- What's going on here?
- -Hold on!

22:35.822 --> 22:38.489
I'll be down in a second!
I'm putting my face on!

22:38.491 --> 22:39.957
Then don't get involved.
Move out of the way.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.059
Listen, come on,
what are you doing?

22:42.061 --> 22:45.096
- Dad, do not get in that car!
- -Lady, take it easy.

22:45.098 --> 22:47.465
I can do this all day.
Want me to keep doing this?

22:47.467 --> 22:49.633
I will do this all...
Really funny.

22:49.635 --> 22:52.103
I'm taking the keys!
I'm taking the keys!

22:52.105 --> 22:53.838
Brian, do something!

23:23.101 --> 23:25.669
Would you put this in, please?

23:25.671 --> 23:26.937
What is this?

23:29.007 --> 23:31.776
<i>Blue-footed booby.</i>

23:31.778 --> 23:33.944
This is so much more pleasant

23:33.946 --> 23:36.046
than travelling with a stranger.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.082
<i>Great-tailed grackle.</i>

23:38.084 --> 23:40.785
Don't you have a job?

23:40.787 --> 23:43.788
I brought the job with me
in my briefcase right there.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.589
Hope you guys don't mind
if your chauffeur

23:45.591 --> 23:47.491
does a little side work.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.429
No one forced you
to take us, you know?

23:51.431 --> 23:53.898
- I'm not saying that you did.
- It sounds like you are.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.966
Honey, can you turn that down
a little bit, please?

23:55.968 --> 23:58.035
- I like it!
- It's too loud!

23:58.037 --> 23:59.537
You used to like it, too.

23:59.539 --> 24:02.139
I love it.
But it's too loud, okay?

24:02.141 --> 24:03.974
I need to use the bathroom.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.509
Right now?

24:05.511 --> 24:07.511
I have to go, damn it.

24:07.513 --> 24:10.080
We... just left.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.816
<i>Dickcissel.</i>

24:17.924 --> 24:19.790
<i>Dunlin.</i>

24:22.962 --> 24:25.563
<i>Eastern whip-poor-will.</i>

24:30.802 --> 24:32.970
All right, we're here.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.738
Do you want to get out
and stretch your legs?

24:34.740 --> 24:36.106
- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure?

24:36.108 --> 24:38.008
- Sure as a pickle.
- Okay.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.578
Here we go.

24:43.181 --> 24:45.149
- Hey.
- -<i> Hey.</i>

24:45.151 --> 24:46.851
- It's gonna be fine.
<i>- Look, if you're doing this</i>

24:46.853 --> 24:48.686
<i>- to prove some kind of point...</i>
- I'm not.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.621
We're gonna drive west
for another day.

24:50.623 --> 24:52.656
They're gonna run out of steam,
and I'm gonna have them back

24:52.658 --> 24:54.158
by tomorrow night, okay?

24:54.160 --> 24:55.993
<i>I doubt it's gonna be that easy.</i>

24:55.995 --> 24:57.895
You keep Annie away
from what's-his-face,

24:57.897 --> 24:59.864
and I'll have your dad back
by the end of the weekend, deal?

24:59.866 --> 25:02.666
- You have a bathroom?
- It's in the garage.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.002
- But it's for customers only...
- Oh, no, he's with me.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.071
- He's just gonna keep walking?
- I'm buying something.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.973
- I'm gonna be a customer.
- Okay.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.845
Is that all?
Because that's like $6.95

25:14.847 --> 25:16.680
and we have a $10 minimum.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.215
Ten bucks to use the bathroom?

25:18.217 --> 25:20.851
Mm-hmm.
It's a company policy.

25:24.022 --> 25:25.589
That was my father-in-law.

25:25.591 --> 25:27.224
Mm-hmm?

25:27.226 --> 25:30.628
I'm driving him to Oregon
so that he can kill himself.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.000
We good here?

25:50.682 --> 25:53.551
<i>Hey, it's Nick.
Leave a message.</i>

25:53.553 --> 25:54.952
<i>Or don't.</i>

25:54.954 --> 25:58.255
- Hey, bud.
- Hey, bud.

25:58.257 --> 25:59.890
It's dad.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.993
I'm just driving through
Pennsylvania right now.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.830
I was thinking about
when we went to Columbus

26:06.832 --> 26:08.866
for your campus visit.

26:08.868 --> 26:12.336
So, I was just thinking
about you, bud.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.739
All right.
Call me back when you can.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.817
What time is it?

26:26.819 --> 26:29.720
Um, just after 10:00.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.655
Do you need a break?

26:31.657 --> 26:32.957
Nope. I'm fine.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.158
You sure?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.926
Sure as a pickle.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.228
'Cause I can take that wheel
for a bit,

26:38.230 --> 26:39.730
if you want me to.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.832
Okay, you cannot drive, Estelle.

26:41.834 --> 26:44.802
Oh, I can drive.
I can drive just fine.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.670
State of New York disagrees.

26:50.742 --> 26:53.777
No doctor's ever
going to approve this.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.879
What's that?

26:55.881 --> 26:58.782
I read all those pamphlets
he's been collecting for years.

26:58.784 --> 27:02.853
They all say
you have to be dying.

27:06.358 --> 27:07.691
Why are you here?

27:12.163 --> 27:13.998
It's where I'm supposed to be.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.291
Can I help you?

27:41.293 --> 27:43.293
Yeah, I'd like two rooms,
please.

27:43.295 --> 27:45.829
Can't do it.
Only one room left.

27:45.831 --> 27:48.198
Oh, god no,
that's not gonna work.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.867
It's a good room.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.202
Two queen beds,
laundry room adjacent.

27:52.204 --> 27:54.338
A view of the fire pit,
which is currently closed.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.206
Yeah, okay, no, no, thank you.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.910
Okay, then, see you
in a couple of hours.

27:59.912 --> 28:02.312
I'm sorry, what?

28:02.314 --> 28:04.081
Hot air balloon fest
up in Toledo.

28:04.083 --> 28:07.351
Everything's booked.
They all end up back here.

28:59.003 --> 29:00.437
Hey, sweetie.

29:00.439 --> 29:02.906
I don't want to talk about it.

29:02.908 --> 29:07.044
Okay.
You want some coffee?

29:09.314 --> 29:11.915
- Black.
- All right.

29:17.322 --> 29:20.824
All right, listen to me,
guys can still care about you

29:20.826 --> 29:23.393
even when they do
really stupid shit.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.329
You should have seen the stuff
your dad used to do

29:25.331 --> 29:27.030
before he got me.

29:27.032 --> 29:28.866
Colt already had me.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.367
Well, then you know what?

29:30.369 --> 29:34.872
He was a very...
Stupid and lucky boy.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.074
- I don't wanna cheer anymore.
- Why?

29:37.076 --> 29:39.076
Because I'd have
to cheer for him.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.145
Oh, babe, that's silly.
I don't know why you'd have

29:41.147 --> 29:43.914
to give up something you love
because of all of this.

29:43.916 --> 29:45.482
Listen, trust me, okay?

29:45.484 --> 29:50.287
A month from now,
this is gonna be so much easier.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.789
Dad hates me.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.490
Oh, gosh, no.
Come here.

29:53.492 --> 29:57.161
No, he doesn't.
No, he doesn't hate you.

29:57.163 --> 30:01.999
His frustrations have
a whole other focus right now.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.481
- I got a salmon salad.
- Thank you.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.383
- Chicken salad.
- Thank you.

30:53.385 --> 30:57.054
And a Patty melt with extra
onion rings and slaw.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.325
Mm, this looks good.

31:01.327 --> 31:03.427
This is dry.

31:03.429 --> 31:05.229
Oh, honey, it'll be fine.

31:05.231 --> 31:06.997
I said Mayo.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.169
Okay.
I'll get you some Mayo.

31:16.507 --> 31:20.377
Can I have some Mayo,
please, on the side?

31:20.379 --> 31:22.312
- Is this a good diner?
- Excellent diner.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.548
Really?
Oh, well, that was lucky.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.351
We picked a good place.
What do you normally get here?

31:27.353 --> 31:29.353
Everything's good,
but I like the meatloaf.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.622
Oh, I love meatloaf.
We didn't get any today.

31:31.624 --> 31:33.190
Hey, let me see
if I can help out...

31:33.192 --> 31:35.559
No. Let her talk.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.095
Ten years ago,
I would've said something.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.529
I would have been
over there by now.

31:39.531 --> 31:42.099
Hey, if it bothers you,
then go over there.

31:42.101 --> 31:44.268
- There's no point.
- Go take her by the hand.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.069
Maybe this is what
you both need.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.105
She's the one
who still has needs.

31:48.107 --> 31:51.208
Well, you know...
There...

31:51.210 --> 31:54.478
There are different ways to...

31:54.480 --> 31:55.913
Handle that.

31:55.915 --> 31:57.214
What?

31:57.216 --> 32:01.151
Have you ever, like,
considered Viagra?

32:01.153 --> 32:04.321
Have <i> you</i> ever
considered Viagra?!

32:04.323 --> 32:06.256
Don't tell me what my needs are.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.658
You talk to me when
your hard-ons

32:07.660 --> 32:09.293
- turn to mashed potatoes!
- All right...

32:09.295 --> 32:10.928
Back when I was your age,

32:10.930 --> 32:13.030
a light gust of wind,
I was hard as a rock!

32:13.032 --> 32:15.532
I could make that woman bloom
without even dipping my stem in.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.200
Honey, honey, keep it down.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.069
Here's your Mayo.
Okay, here we go.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.104
You remember the summer
that we bought the cabin

32:21.106 --> 32:22.673
and you sent the kids
to your father?

32:22.675 --> 32:24.574
You couldn't keep your hands
off me, could you?

32:24.576 --> 32:27.244
No, Raymond, I couldn't,
but I don't know if Brian

32:27.246 --> 32:29.146
- is really interested...
- We did it every day.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.647
- Every single day.
- Ray?

32:30.649 --> 32:32.616
We did it until the tanagers
started chirping.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.384
Take these pills, please.
And stop bragging.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.553
And this woman
is 12 years my junior.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.288
And I could still get it up!

32:40.491 --> 32:44.127
All I'm saying ray,
is that I think that...

32:44.129 --> 32:46.463
That there are other options.

32:46.465 --> 32:47.464
Besides what?

32:47.466 --> 32:50.067
This trip.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.969
Nobody wants this, ray.

32:54.572 --> 32:57.741
She forgot my dressing,
so I'll be back in a minute.

33:01.612 --> 33:05.349
Do you have any idea how much
this is upsetting your daughter?

33:05.351 --> 33:06.984
Yeah.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.585
Then where the hell is she?

33:08.587 --> 33:10.988
Well, she does have
obligations as a parent.

33:10.990 --> 33:15.125
Bullshit! You all gave up
on me a long time ago!

33:18.563 --> 33:20.197
I'm outta here.

33:24.369 --> 33:26.203
- What happened?
- He's outta here.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.671
What do you mean
he's outta here?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.106
Where's he going?

33:29.108 --> 33:31.475
Raymond?

33:31.477 --> 33:35.479
What are you doing?
Raymond?!

33:35.481 --> 33:39.016
Ray. Ray, where are
you going?!

33:39.018 --> 33:40.617
Don't act like
you can't hear me!

33:40.619 --> 33:43.620
- Where are you going?
- Ray, come on back to the car!

33:43.622 --> 33:45.722
What, you think you're gonna
hitchhike to Oregon?

33:45.724 --> 33:49.326
You hate hitchhikers!
You always have!

33:49.328 --> 33:50.694
You don't even have your pills

33:50.696 --> 33:52.362
or anything else
you need with you.

33:52.364 --> 33:54.464
Come on, let's go back...

33:57.102 --> 34:00.070
You're acting like
a spoiled brat child!

34:00.072 --> 34:02.606
You're a grown man
for Pete's sake.

34:02.608 --> 34:04.541
Hey, honey.
Just calling to check in.

34:04.543 --> 34:09.346
Reminiscing a little bit
about Nick's campus tour.

34:09.348 --> 34:12.114
We're taking the same route.
We're in Illinois.

34:12.117 --> 34:13.550
Now.

34:13.552 --> 34:18.388
Looks the same.
Uh... everything's fine here.

34:18.389 --> 34:21.591
I think we're gonna be home
sooner than expected.

34:21.592 --> 34:27.330
I just think they are...
Running out of gas on this one.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.433
Stop it!
You're hurting me!

34:29.435 --> 34:30.467
Anyway...

34:30.469 --> 34:32.202
Love you.

34:36.174 --> 34:38.108
- Hey, mom?
- Hey, honey.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.310
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Sure.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.481
Before you get mad,
can you just hear him out?

34:44.483 --> 34:47.484
Hear who out, honey?
Oh, god.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.386
I thought you weren't
talking to him anymore.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.688
Well, Colt has something
he wants to say to you.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.556
I'm really sorry
about what happened.

34:53.559 --> 34:55.125
With the pictures...

34:55.127 --> 34:56.525
Yeah. I know what
you're referring to.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.462
Look, I never showed them
to anybody.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.697
Skyler Dudley found them
on my phone and sent them out.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.699
- Oh, Skyler Dudley did it, huh?
- Mom, he swears.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.501
Don't worry,
I already beat his ass.

35:04.503 --> 35:06.436
Then it looks like you've
taken care of everything.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.371
So you can go home now.
Thank you for stopping by.

35:08.373 --> 35:10.207
- Mom!
- What, Annie?

35:10.209 --> 35:12.409
You said not to give up
on something that I love!

35:12.411 --> 35:14.678
I was talking about cheering.

35:14.680 --> 35:18.148
Get him out of my house!

35:42.540 --> 35:44.875
This shirt is itchy.

35:44.877 --> 35:46.910
Do you want me
to turn the air on?

35:46.912 --> 35:48.845
Do what you want.
I don't give a shit.

35:51.616 --> 35:54.784
Hey, if you're tired,
let's stop and get a motel.

35:54.786 --> 35:55.886
No, no, no, no.

35:55.888 --> 35:58.321
I've made a reservation...

35:58.323 --> 36:01.691
For two separate rooms

36:01.693 --> 36:03.760
at a nice bed and breakfast
in Iowa city.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.762
We're gonna get there,
we're gonna have a nice

36:05.764 --> 36:08.298
long conversation
about all of this.

36:08.300 --> 36:10.167
I don't need to have
another conversation.

36:10.169 --> 36:11.735
We need to get to Oregon.

36:15.173 --> 36:19.776
Okay, if you're going to insist
on continuing to drive,

36:19.778 --> 36:22.312
not everyone in this car
has a death wish.

36:22.314 --> 36:23.947
Here.

36:23.949 --> 36:25.649
What is this?

36:25.651 --> 36:28.218
It'll help keep you focused
and alert.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.654
It's fine.
I'm a nurse, don't forget.

36:30.656 --> 36:33.723
In fact, I'm gonna have
a little smidge of one myself,

36:33.725 --> 36:35.792
and I'll keep you company.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.961
It'll be fine.
It's nothing.

36:37.963 --> 36:42.566
I'm just gonna have
a little, tiny... mmm.

36:42.568 --> 36:46.469
Just a touch.
Just a tad.

36:49.373 --> 36:51.975
I just took the whole thing.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.611
That's fine.
You're driving.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.747
You need to be... sharp.

37:20.272 --> 37:23.006
Shut the fucking music off!

37:24.742 --> 37:26.409
Here, just put these in.

37:33.485 --> 37:34.918
Ooh...

37:54.005 --> 37:56.940
Let me know if you see
any animals or something.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.375
Okay.

37:58.377 --> 38:00.310
I mean, not to look at,
but to avoid.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.012
- I'm watching.
- Okay.

38:02.014 --> 38:05.015
- Is there a storm coming?
- I don't know, but what...

38:05.017 --> 38:07.484
- Because the clouds are rolling.
- Yeah, they are.

38:07.486 --> 38:10.320
Oh, man.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.989
There is a bird aviary
near here.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.291
Oh, no way.

38:14.293 --> 38:15.325
Way.

38:15.327 --> 38:16.459
Where?

38:16.461 --> 38:18.061
Highway 80.

38:18.063 --> 38:21.898
- Along highway 80?
- The old Lincoln highway.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.633
You think
that's Abraham Lincoln?

38:23.635 --> 38:25.535
Could be. Could be.
Maybe Mary Todd.

38:25.537 --> 38:28.405
I like her, but I don't think
they did that back then.

38:28.407 --> 38:29.806
Oh, deer! Deer! Deer!
Deer! Deer!

38:29.808 --> 38:31.308
Deer! Deer! Deer!
Deer! Deer!

38:31.310 --> 38:32.642
Well, be careful.
Don't crash us.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.444
Never mind, it's a tree.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.616
Okay, I'm...
I'm just gonna, um...

38:39.618 --> 38:42.752
Put my little head down,
just for a minute.

38:42.754 --> 38:45.622
Okie-dokie.
Not tired at all.

39:28.499 --> 39:30.633
- We're here!
- Where?

39:30.635 --> 39:32.068
Little surprise for you guys.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.670
Look, honey,
it's the bird sanctuary!

39:33.672 --> 39:35.538
- Wow.
- What is this?

39:35.540 --> 39:37.073
It says it opens at sunrise.

39:37.075 --> 39:40.377
Well, it doesn't look open.
Honey, look.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.746
Maybe it's not bird season.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.116
Hold on.
Watch out.

39:46.118 --> 39:49.386
- What are you doing?

39:49.388 --> 39:51.688
Brian, don't hurt yourself.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.556
What happened
to the bed and breakfast?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.392
Couldn't sleep.
Drove all the way here.

39:55.394 --> 39:57.160
Watch out.

39:59.964 --> 40:02.499
Whoa, first try.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.505
The sanctuary is open.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.441
Will we get arrested?

40:13.711 --> 40:17.080
So, we could possibly
see the rosy Finch,

40:17.082 --> 40:22.051
the western wood peewee,
the Willow flycatcher.

40:22.053 --> 40:25.655
Oh, you're gonna like this one,
the horned lark.

40:25.657 --> 40:28.691
Whoo! If I was a bird I would
want to come here, Estelle.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.527
I know!

40:30.529 --> 40:33.897
This is...
Just what we needed.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.900
- It's just what we needed.
- You think he likes it?

40:36.902 --> 40:39.135
I do.
You know he's cranky.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.438
But I think he does like it.

40:41.440 --> 40:45.975
It's really beautiful!
Isn't this great?!

40:45.977 --> 40:48.077
We don't have any binoculars.

40:48.079 --> 40:49.646
We don't need binoculars.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.481
We're just gonna use our eyes.

40:51.483 --> 40:53.583
I can't see anything
without binoculars.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.218
Well, we're in here now.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.487
Let's just enjoy ourselves.
It's beautiful.

40:57.489 --> 41:00.523
Let's close our eyes,
and just listen for the birds.

41:00.525 --> 41:03.860
Ooh...

41:03.862 --> 41:05.695
Are you okay?

41:05.697 --> 41:07.130
Mm? Mm-hmm.

41:07.132 --> 41:10.099
All right, so we missed
the gazebo back here.

41:10.101 --> 41:13.903
So everybody come this way.
We want to see the rosy finches.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.538
Come on.

41:15.540 --> 41:19.042
I'm gonna stand still
for a second.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.543
You find something, ray?

41:20.545 --> 41:22.879
I'm gonna find my dick
and take a piss.

41:22.881 --> 41:26.082
We don't have time for this.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.017
Hey, honey.

41:28.019 --> 41:30.119
<i>Hi, how's it going?
Where are you?</i>

41:30.121 --> 41:35.892
We are at
the Wallick aviary sanctuary.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.194
What?
Where's that?

41:38.196 --> 41:42.832
It is in...
Cheyenne, Wyoming.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.268
In Wyoming?
Are you serious?

41:45.270 --> 41:47.237
Yeah, I guess you can cover
a lot of ground

41:47.239 --> 41:49.138
if you drive through the night.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.275
- How did that even happen?
- Well, it was for the birds.

41:52.277 --> 41:53.943
<i>For the birds?
What are you talking about?</i>

41:53.945 --> 41:55.778
It's a bird sanctuary...

41:55.780 --> 41:57.847
Yep. Yep.

42:01.653 --> 42:02.886
Sandpiper.

42:04.222 --> 42:07.524
That's a stilt, maybe upland.

42:07.526 --> 42:09.526
Did you fill Annie's focalin

42:09.528 --> 42:11.628
when you picked up my dad's
scrip the other day?

42:11.630 --> 42:13.830
I filled whatever prescription
you gave me, why?

42:13.832 --> 42:15.532
<i>Well, she's out again.</i>

42:15.534 --> 42:17.300
So, either we forgot
to pick up the scrip

42:17.302 --> 42:20.169
<i>or she's taking more
than she should.</i>

42:22.873 --> 42:24.908
What do the pills look like?

42:24.910 --> 42:26.776
<i>I don't know, honey.
They're a pill.</i>

42:26.778 --> 42:29.045
<i>It's a blue pill.</i>

42:29.047 --> 42:30.780
Oh shit!
I'll call you back!

42:30.782 --> 42:32.015
What was that?!

42:32.017 --> 42:34.851
Oh, shit.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.653
- Ray, are you okay?
- No, don't touch me.

42:36.655 --> 42:38.121
No, no. I just want
to help you up, buddy...

42:38.123 --> 42:40.256
Let go of me!

42:42.694 --> 42:44.594
What's going on?

42:44.596 --> 42:47.764
Nothing! Nothing, Estelle!
It's fine! We're okay!

42:47.766 --> 42:51.701
Okay, well hurry up!
I'll meet you at the gazebo!

42:51.703 --> 42:53.303
I'm sorry, I didn't...

42:55.239 --> 42:57.574
Here.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.976
You can...
Cover up the...

42:59.978 --> 43:02.712
- It's because I fell.
- I know.

43:02.714 --> 43:04.180
That function still works.

43:04.182 --> 43:05.815
Well, see? There.

43:05.817 --> 43:07.584
There's something
to be positive about.

43:07.586 --> 43:09.852
I'll be long gone before
I can't push out a piss.

43:09.854 --> 43:11.321
We don't have to talk
about that.

43:11.323 --> 43:13.089
No, I'm serious.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.692
I made myself a promise
a long time ago.

43:15.694 --> 43:18.628
After what happened
to my friend Abe.

43:18.630 --> 43:20.296
Just give me a minute.

43:20.298 --> 43:22.165
I-I don't know who Abe is.

43:22.167 --> 43:24.133
Oh, he's a golfing buddy.

43:24.135 --> 43:27.003
You met him once at
our anniversary party at boca.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.338
We were a mean trio.

43:28.340 --> 43:30.840
It was Abe Norfolk,
Mitch ebbs, and me.

43:30.842 --> 43:32.842
Have you told them
what you're up to?

43:32.844 --> 43:35.812
No. Those guys
are long gone.

43:35.814 --> 43:38.348
Abe started to lose his marbles
pretty early.

43:38.350 --> 43:40.383
He'd run around the golf course

43:40.385 --> 43:42.952
picking up everybody else's
stray balls.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.121
And then one day he just
walked off the course,

43:45.123 --> 43:46.823
and never came back.

43:46.825 --> 43:50.226
We thought maybe he went home,
but we found him later.

43:50.228 --> 43:52.962
He was sleeping under a bench
in the ladies locker room.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.631
He'd pissed himself.

43:56.967 --> 44:00.303
I didn't see Abe
for a long time after that.

44:00.305 --> 44:03.706
I thought maybe
he was embarrassed, you know?

44:03.708 --> 44:06.676
And then I heard
he had a stroke.

44:06.678 --> 44:10.213
His wife found him
in the bathtub.

44:10.215 --> 44:11.881
I went to see him.

44:15.219 --> 44:17.186
You know,
it was like somebody...

44:22.192 --> 44:23.960
Sorry.

44:23.962 --> 44:27.096
Somebody had grabbed him...

44:27.098 --> 44:30.900
By the collar and they sh...
Shook him up.

44:30.902 --> 44:33.269
And his face
just froze like that.

44:36.907 --> 44:39.208
After that,
Mitch and I had a joke,

44:39.210 --> 44:42.145
which one of us was gonna be
the last man standing,

44:42.147 --> 44:46.382
and Mitch got lucky,
died in his sleep.

44:46.384 --> 44:49.886
So I promised myself
I was never gonna go like Abe.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.727
And I'm not.

45:28.425 --> 45:31.027
I'm not feeling
very comfortable.

45:31.029 --> 45:32.862
I think you better pull over.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.363
Here, here.
Right over here.

45:34.365 --> 45:36.265
What are we doing?

45:36.267 --> 45:38.201
We're just gonna change out
some muddy clothes and stuff.

45:38.203 --> 45:40.236
Why didn't we
do that back there?

45:40.238 --> 45:43.139
Because we had to flee
the scene.

45:43.141 --> 45:44.974
I'll get your luggage.

45:49.213 --> 45:51.447
You look like shit.

45:51.449 --> 45:52.949
Thank you, ray.

45:59.123 --> 46:01.224
- Where do you want it?
- -Right there.

46:01.226 --> 46:04.127
- Okay.
- Now go away. Go away.

46:04.129 --> 46:05.394
Okay.

46:16.807 --> 46:18.107
God...

46:34.224 --> 46:38.928
I can't do this anymore.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.329
I, um, uh...

46:40.331 --> 46:41.964
Ray, this is as far as I can go.

46:41.966 --> 46:43.800
What do you mean?

46:43.802 --> 46:46.836
I'm just... uh, you know,
I think I need Kate on this.

46:46.838 --> 46:48.905
And it's... um... um...

46:48.907 --> 46:51.073
You know,
I thought I could do it.

46:51.075 --> 46:54.310
We'd get out on the road,
we have a nice long drive

46:54.312 --> 46:56.312
and everything and it helps
to clear the mind,

46:56.314 --> 46:57.947
but then, um, you know,

46:57.949 --> 47:00.049
my head is really
hurting right now,

47:00.051 --> 47:03.886
and I have responsibilities
at home, and I have work.

47:03.888 --> 47:06.355
And that...
That was my favorite shirt.

47:06.357 --> 47:08.224
And I really think my heart

47:08.226 --> 47:10.126
might stop beating
at any moment.

47:10.128 --> 47:11.427
And I don't think
that I'm safe to drive.

47:11.429 --> 47:13.162
And, um...

47:16.500 --> 47:18.401
Do you really want to get
all the way to Oregon

47:18.403 --> 47:20.570
only to have them refuse you?

47:20.572 --> 47:25.141
If you would just take me
as far as salt lake city,

47:25.143 --> 47:27.543
I would be very grateful.

47:27.545 --> 47:29.979
- Oh.
- -Fuck.

47:29.981 --> 47:31.547
We're close
to salt lake city, aren't we?

47:31.549 --> 47:34.250
- We're seeing Danny?
- We told him we might stop by.

47:34.252 --> 47:36.452
- How did that go?
- It went.

47:36.454 --> 47:38.621
We called him, but we didn't
know if we would have time.

47:38.623 --> 47:41.123
Does he understand why
you're driving across country?

47:41.125 --> 47:43.292
- Yes.
- And he's okay with that?

47:43.294 --> 47:46.229
- How the fuck should I know?
- It was a short conversation.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.567
How far is it to salt lake city?

47:51.569 --> 47:54.070
Oh, great!
I should call him.

47:54.072 --> 47:56.138
Can I use your phone, please?

48:49.660 --> 48:53.429
Oh, Danny, you look great.

48:53.431 --> 48:56.032
Thank you, mom.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.437
I like where you put
the blanket.

49:03.573 --> 49:05.141
It's gotten a lot of use.

49:05.143 --> 49:07.009
Yeah, it's a good blanket.

49:07.011 --> 49:11.047
Oh, there's the one I made Paul.
Are we gonna see him later?

49:11.049 --> 49:12.982
- I don't think so.
- Oh.

49:14.485 --> 49:17.053
Should I be worried about him?

49:17.055 --> 49:20.489
Oh, no.
No, I think he's fine.

49:23.027 --> 49:25.962
Are you gonna get that?

49:29.233 --> 49:32.468
Well, your father would like to
have some time alone with you.

49:32.470 --> 49:36.305
So I am going to take a shower,
if that's okay with you,

49:36.307 --> 49:39.108
and just lie down
for a little bit.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.310
Do you have anything to drink?

49:41.312 --> 49:43.446
Like drink, drink?

49:43.448 --> 49:45.214
Your mother's found a new hobby.

49:45.216 --> 49:47.350
I'm sure there's
something in the fridge.

49:47.352 --> 49:50.419
Okay. I'll just peruse
the kitchen, thank you.

49:58.161 --> 50:03.132
I know these are not the most
ideal circumstances.

50:03.134 --> 50:05.701
But, um...

50:05.703 --> 50:10.406
You know...
I don't have long.

50:10.408 --> 50:12.541
Well, that's not true, is it?

50:12.543 --> 50:13.676
What?

50:13.678 --> 50:15.378
That's not true.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.346
Kate told me that you're fine.

50:17.348 --> 50:19.248
No. It's my decision.

50:19.250 --> 50:22.785
No, actually,
it's the physician's decision.

50:22.787 --> 50:24.787
And you're not terminal.

50:24.789 --> 50:28.190
I know the protocol.
I made my oral request.

50:28.192 --> 50:30.726
And somewhere in here,
I got my written request, too.

50:30.728 --> 50:33.329
I want you to take a look at it.

50:33.331 --> 50:36.132
Yeah, here it is.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.600
I followed all the rules.

50:39.736 --> 50:42.204
Well, good luck
getting a signature on this

50:42.206 --> 50:44.206
by anyone who wants
to keep their license.

50:44.208 --> 50:46.308
Well, you know,
you're not a doctor.

50:46.310 --> 50:49.612
Wow. That took all of what,
five minutes?

50:49.614 --> 50:51.180
That's gotta be a record.

50:51.182 --> 50:53.215
- Danny, please...
- You never...

50:53.217 --> 50:56.285
- What, of course...
- Danny, please, let me talk.

50:56.287 --> 50:58.421
Because I didn't
finish med school,

50:58.423 --> 51:00.089
my opinion doesn't
mean anything?

51:00.091 --> 51:01.557
You're not letting me talk.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.492
I don't want to go
through all that again.

51:03.494 --> 51:04.727
It's not why I came.

51:07.464 --> 51:09.532
Why <i> did</i> you come?

51:09.534 --> 51:12.301
Because I wanted to see you
again, son, before...

51:12.303 --> 51:14.070
Before I'm gone.

51:14.072 --> 51:16.505
I wanted to mend certain tears
in our relationship.

51:16.507 --> 51:19.842
You know? I wanted to say
that I forgive you.

51:19.844 --> 51:23.112
- You forgive <i> me?</i>

51:23.114 --> 51:24.747
Yes, I forgive you.

51:24.749 --> 51:26.315
Is that Paul calling?

51:26.317 --> 51:27.716
You know what I'm talking about.

51:27.718 --> 51:29.752
- No, I don't.
- Oh, you don't, huh?

51:29.754 --> 51:31.754
How about all the unreturned
phone calls?

51:31.756 --> 51:33.422
How about all the letters
I wrote to you

51:33.424 --> 51:35.191
that you never even
acknowledged?

51:35.193 --> 51:38.127
You closed that door long before
I stopped speaking to you.

51:38.129 --> 51:40.162
You scrutinized
every decision I made.

51:40.164 --> 51:41.831
You tore them down.

51:41.833 --> 51:43.466
No. That is not true!

51:43.468 --> 51:46.168
As your father,
I wanted to give you options.

51:46.170 --> 51:48.504
I wanted to give you
opportunities!

51:48.506 --> 51:51.841
For what?!
A life like yours?

51:51.843 --> 51:55.177
You know,
enjoy your visit to Oregon.

51:55.179 --> 51:59.882
And do me a favor.
Don't stop by on your way back.

51:59.884 --> 52:01.550
Danny, wait.

52:01.552 --> 52:03.786
What?

52:03.788 --> 52:04.820
Shh, shh.

52:04.822 --> 52:06.789
- What?
- Shh!

52:06.791 --> 52:08.491
Come here. Come here.

52:08.493 --> 52:10.226
What is it?

52:18.435 --> 52:21.370
- This is your angiogram?
- Yeah.

52:21.372 --> 52:23.172
Well, I'm not a cardiologist.

52:23.174 --> 52:25.641
It's too blocked
to operate again.

52:25.643 --> 52:27.843
- You denied surgery?
- Yeah.

52:27.845 --> 52:29.845
Either way, my time's up.

52:29.847 --> 52:32.148
It's all in the file.

52:35.185 --> 52:39.388
Look, don't tell your mother,
and don't tell Katherine

52:39.390 --> 52:42.691
because they're gonna
make me have surgery.

52:42.693 --> 52:45.761
And, Danny...
I don't want to do it.

53:36.480 --> 53:39.348
Hey! What is he doing here?
What is this? What is this?

53:39.350 --> 53:41.550
- Get up, get up, get up!
- Mom, get out!

53:41.552 --> 53:43.419
- God, I'm sorry.
- Put your dress on right now.

53:43.421 --> 53:45.721
He is not allowed in this house.
You are grounded!

53:45.723 --> 53:47.556
- What are you doing?
- We weren't even doing anything.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.924
Oh, really? It looked
like a lot of things.

53:48.926 --> 53:50.659
Why are you even home right now?

53:50.661 --> 53:52.661
What do you mean, why am I home?
I live here, Annie.

53:52.663 --> 53:54.797
- This is so unfair.
- What's unfair?

53:54.799 --> 53:56.432
You put your guilt on me
all the time!

53:56.434 --> 53:57.766
What am I guilty for?

53:57.768 --> 53:59.602
I don't know.
Making dad take grandpa.

53:59.604 --> 54:01.570
I didn't make
your dad do anything!

54:01.572 --> 54:03.772
You're the reason that I'm not
with my father right now!

54:05.508 --> 54:07.343
Just go be with grandpa, mom.

54:07.345 --> 54:09.578
It's obviously
what you want to do!

54:11.382 --> 54:14.516
Oh, god.

54:29.767 --> 54:31.533
<i>The white-winged cress.</i>

54:31.535 --> 54:33.435
I can take over
whenever you want.

54:33.437 --> 54:35.838
You've been driving
for what, three days?

54:35.840 --> 54:37.539
You could use a break.

54:37.541 --> 54:39.708
<i>The purple Martin.</i>

54:39.710 --> 54:41.844
I know this must be confusing.

54:41.846 --> 54:43.379
Well, yes, I can't understand

54:43.381 --> 54:44.847
why you're on board with this.

54:44.849 --> 54:47.016
I think it's important
that I be here.

54:52.622 --> 54:53.889
How's Paul?

54:53.891 --> 54:56.859
<i>American coute.</i>

54:56.861 --> 54:59.995
- He and I split.
- Oh, man.

54:59.997 --> 55:02.998
I got tired of his
Mormon by day,

55:03.000 --> 55:06.669
"more men" by night routine.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.572
Well, that'll do it.

55:10.574 --> 55:12.308
I rehearsed that.

55:12.310 --> 55:14.443
Mm-hmm.

55:16.614 --> 55:18.547
I'm really glad you're here.

55:18.549 --> 55:21.850
I don't think I could've
talked him out of this alone.

55:21.852 --> 55:24.353
<i>Eastern owl screech.</i>

55:24.355 --> 55:25.921
We're not talking him
out of anything.

55:34.931 --> 55:36.632
<i>Honey, relax.</i>

55:36.634 --> 55:38.434
<i>Danny's here.
Everything's fine.</i>

55:38.436 --> 55:40.002
Oh, well, all right.

55:40.004 --> 55:41.770
<i>We're headed to the cabin later.</i>

55:41.772 --> 55:44.039
It's been three days already.
I want you to come back.

55:44.041 --> 55:45.874
<i>No, sweetie.</i>

55:45.876 --> 55:49.578
No, I told you.
This is something I have to do.

55:49.580 --> 55:51.747
I understand,
I understand. But look.

55:51.749 --> 55:53.849
Here, talk to your husband.

55:55.485 --> 55:56.952
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>
- Now he tells me

55:56.954 --> 55:58.487
that you're going to the cabin.

55:58.489 --> 56:00.122
I thought that Danny
was the last stop.

56:00.124 --> 56:02.558
<i>I'm telling you, this beast
has a mind of its own.</i>

56:02.560 --> 56:04.526
And whose fault is that, Brian?

56:04.528 --> 56:06.128
Whose fault is it?
I don't know.

56:06.130 --> 56:07.763
We got a lot of options here.

56:07.765 --> 56:09.565
It could be your suicidal father

56:09.567 --> 56:11.633
or your patricidal brother
or your blotto mother.

56:11.635 --> 56:13.569
Anyone but you, right?
Anyone but you.

56:13.571 --> 56:15.037
Hey!
I'm doing this for you!

56:15.039 --> 56:17.072
So I would appreciate just
a little bit of empathy.

56:17.074 --> 56:19.074
I swear to god, Brian,

56:19.076 --> 56:20.843
turn them around right now,

56:20.845 --> 56:23.379
or I am flying out there,
and I am taking over, okay?

56:23.381 --> 56:25.013
<i>- Unbelievable. I'm done.</i>
- I have to go.

56:25.015 --> 56:27.449
Because I don't
drink that much...

56:27.451 --> 56:29.752
Come on, pick up, boy, pick up.

56:34.090 --> 56:37.159
<i>Hey, it's Nick.
Leave a message.</i>

56:37.161 --> 56:38.794
So, guys, what's this
I hear about going

56:38.796 --> 56:40.496
to the cabin tonight?

56:40.498 --> 56:42.064
Mom and dad thought
it would be better

56:42.066 --> 56:44.533
- than paying for a hotel.
- Really?

56:44.535 --> 56:46.468
Yep.
What's the difference?

56:46.470 --> 56:48.170
Don't you...
Don't you think

56:48.172 --> 56:50.105
it sends the wrong message here?

56:50.107 --> 56:52.674
There's no message, Brian.
We're taking dad to Oregon.

56:52.676 --> 56:54.176
That's the whole point.

56:54.178 --> 56:56.712
No, no, no, the point
is to not <i> get</i> to Oregon.

56:56.714 --> 56:58.614
We weren't even supposed
to get past Utah.

56:58.616 --> 57:00.048
Look, I am happy
to captain this trip

57:00.050 --> 57:01.517
from here on out.

57:01.519 --> 57:03.152
They are <i> my</i> parents, after all.

57:03.154 --> 57:04.753
We'll just rent a car.

57:04.755 --> 57:07.089
And you can head back
and see Kate and Annie.

57:09.459 --> 57:10.726
There we go.

57:10.728 --> 57:13.829
Onions, onions, and Sauerkraut.

57:13.831 --> 57:15.531
Well, we can't do that, sorry,

57:15.533 --> 57:16.999
'cause we're gonna go
see Nick tonight.

57:17.001 --> 57:18.534
Oh, we're gonna go see Nick?

57:18.536 --> 57:20.169
Yeah. He changed his plans
around for us.

57:20.171 --> 57:22.104
So we're gonna head over
to Boise and you're gonna stare

57:22.106 --> 57:24.640
your grandson in the face
and tell him what you're up to.

57:24.642 --> 57:26.141
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

57:26.143 --> 57:27.810
- No, I'm not.
- Why, why?

57:27.812 --> 57:30.045
Because I have to be in Oregon
tomorrow morning.

57:30.047 --> 57:31.947
No, you have to be in Oregon
tomorrow afternoon

57:31.949 --> 57:33.515
for this mystery appointment.

57:33.517 --> 57:35.451
I have to be in Oregon
tomorrow morning!

57:35.453 --> 57:37.553
Fine, you will be there
tomorrow morning

57:37.555 --> 57:39.621
or whenever you need
to be there, but tonight,

57:39.623 --> 57:42.524
we will be in Boise,
and we will be talking to Nick!

57:42.526 --> 57:45.494
What the hell, dad?

57:45.496 --> 57:47.629
And also, it's on the way!

57:47.631 --> 57:49.665
Why are you spitting it out?
It's great!

57:49.667 --> 57:51.467
Are you sure
you don't want a dog?!

57:51.469 --> 57:54.803
Oh, yeah, I want a hot dog now,
Estelle, after seeing that!

57:54.805 --> 57:56.138
Mother fucker!

58:14.724 --> 58:17.025
Oh!
Hey, Danny? Danny?

58:17.027 --> 58:18.760
Sorry, bub,
can I borrow your phone?

58:18.762 --> 58:20.262
My battery is dead.

58:20.264 --> 58:22.231
I need to let Nick know
that we're getting close.

58:26.203 --> 58:29.571
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Aha! There you are, boy.

58:29.573 --> 58:31.039
<i>Dad, are you seriously
calling me</i>

58:31.041 --> 58:32.875
<i>from someone else's phone
right now?</i>

58:32.877 --> 58:34.877
Well, I am great, thanks,
just wanted to let you know

58:34.879 --> 58:36.879
- that we are getting close.
<i>- Where? Here?</i>

58:36.881 --> 58:38.780
<i>There is no fucking way
grandma and grandpa</i>

58:38.782 --> 58:40.082
<i>are coming to visit here.</i>

58:40.084 --> 58:42.084
They're excited to see you, too.

58:42.086 --> 58:44.253
<i>I don't care.
Turn the car around.</i>

58:44.255 --> 58:46.154
- Hey, Nick!
- That's your uncle Danny.

58:46.156 --> 58:48.090
- He's with us, too.
<i>- Fuck me, he's with you, too?</i>

58:48.092 --> 58:50.626
So, I'm gonna call you
when we get a little closer

58:50.628 --> 58:52.628
to get exact directions,
but I know it's Sperry house.

58:52.630 --> 58:54.963
<i>-Absolutely not!</i>

58:54.965 --> 58:56.665
All right.

58:56.667 --> 58:59.067
That's quite a charmer
you raised there.

59:05.708 --> 59:08.310
<i>Hey, it's Nick.
Leave a message.</i>

59:08.312 --> 59:10.579
Well, all right.
He's not picking up.

59:10.581 --> 59:12.114
Probably deep in his studies,
so if you guys

59:12.116 --> 59:13.882
just want to wait here,
I'll be right back.

59:13.884 --> 59:15.117
Maybe he doesn't want to see us.

59:15.119 --> 59:17.019
He doesn't have a choice.

59:18.889 --> 59:21.023
Looks like a nice party.

59:21.025 --> 59:23.258
Hey, Danny, maybe it's better
if you wait here with them.

59:23.260 --> 59:25.827
You're not leaving me here
to babysit.

59:32.702 --> 59:35.070
I'll tell you what,
why don't you ask around here,

59:35.072 --> 59:36.805
see if you can find somebody.

59:36.807 --> 59:38.273
I'm gonna go inside.

59:38.275 --> 59:40.042
Nick Gleason!

59:40.044 --> 59:43.712
It's your dad and you gay
formerly Mormon uncle!

59:44.881 --> 59:46.148
You know what?

59:46.150 --> 59:48.584
I think I'm gonna go
stretch my legs.

59:50.653 --> 59:52.154
I'll be back.

59:58.328 --> 01:00:01.363
You asshole!

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:12.774
Is there a tip jar or something
to pay for the beer?

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.644
No?
Okay, thank you.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:17.879
Hi. How are you?

01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:54.650
Uh, Nick?

01:00:57.954 --> 01:01:00.222
- You lost, guy?

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:01.957
No, I'm just looking for my son.

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:04.326
Uh, Nick Gleason.

01:01:04.328 --> 01:01:06.228
- Is this Nick's room?
- Don't know him.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.263
But I'm sure he's somewhere
studying hard,

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:09.931
like we all are.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:12.934
Brian? Brian?

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:14.836
Is that like a bird eagle
feather and a...

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:16.705
Yeah, yeah,
it's because I'm flying.

01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:18.373
This is like a broom
or something.

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:20.075
It looks like a brush.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:21.843
That looks like a shark's tooth.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:24.179
This is a bullet,
'cause I'm a shooter.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.314
Estelle, come on.
Estelle, come on.

01:01:26.316 --> 01:01:28.083
Raymond, I'm just talking
with the kids,

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:29.818
- having a little drink.
- You had enough.

01:01:29.820 --> 01:01:32.754
Well, look who got his
big boy pants on for once.

01:01:32.756 --> 01:01:35.123
- Yo, just take it easy.
- Back off, kid.

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.925
No. You know what...
Raymond!

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:39.695
You don't get to decide
when you want to care.

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:46.034
Get the fuck out of here,
old man.

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:53.475
- Brian? Brian!
- Danny?

01:01:53.477 --> 01:01:55.277
You lost?

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:58.080
I... I don't think
that he lives here anymore.

01:01:58.082 --> 01:01:59.715
He doesn't.

01:01:59.717 --> 01:02:02.084
But I found out where he works.

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:32.180
Fuck me.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:41.089
All right, uh...
Let me get this straight.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.492
You go there,
and you see this doctor.

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:47.062
And if he thinks it's legit,
you know, he kills you?

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.097
Pretty much.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.966
Wow, uh...

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:54.770
That's, uh...
That's awesome.

01:02:54.772 --> 01:02:56.338
Wait, Nick, no.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:58.340
What? I think people
should have a right

01:02:58.342 --> 01:02:59.841
to make their own choices.

01:02:59.843 --> 01:03:02.344
Are they serving these tables?

01:03:02.346 --> 01:03:05.080
I doubt it.
What will you have?

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:07.349
I want a shot of vodka
and a wine please.

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:09.084
- Nice.
- Okay, thank you.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:11.386
Listen to her,
trying to juice herself up

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:13.054
- for whoever wants it.

01:03:13.056 --> 01:03:14.489
She can't wait till I drop

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.291
so she can get
her stocking stuffed.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.461
I am right here beside you

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:21.863
every single night in bed.

01:03:21.865 --> 01:03:23.431
How long has it been
since you've touched me?

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.066
We are under
somebody else's roof.

01:03:25.068 --> 01:03:26.568
Stocking stuffed?

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:28.503
How about just holding my hand,

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:30.172
you baronial son of a bitch?

01:03:30.174 --> 01:03:32.207
Why didn't you tell me
that you got a job here?

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:34.242
Because I didn't want to.

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:36.878
Nick, your grandfather
is a very jealous man

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.547
in his golden years.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:40.949
I'm really honestly just trying
to understand, because,

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.517
you know, during the summer,
it's hard enough

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.820
- to get you to mow the lawn.
- Dad, are you serious?

01:03:44.822 --> 01:03:46.888
Well, I don't understand.
Do you need money?

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:48.290
- All right.
- Take it, take it.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:51.293
I have to get back to work.
But thank you.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.961
And grandpa I want you to know,

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:54.529
I think what you're doing
is very brave.

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:56.464
Thank you, Nick.

01:03:58.601 --> 01:04:00.969
What are you?
68 years old?

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:03.972
Acting like a fool.
Show me some respect.

01:04:03.974 --> 01:04:06.908
- Right in front of my grandson?
- Raymond, ray... come on.

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.511
Hey, buddy, did you change dorms

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.446
and not tell your mom and me?

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.181
I'm taking the semester off

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.851
to intern
at a photography gallery.

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:17.352
I would have told you,

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:19.454
but I knew you wouldn't
approve, so I didn't.

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:21.957
Well, of course I'm not going to
approve of my 19-year-old son

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:24.259
dropping out of college
so that he can pursue a hobby.

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.994
Dad, it's just a semester.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:28.263
I'm wasting my time
and your money studying gen eds.

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:30.465
But you cannot
just quit college, boy!

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.901
Brian, will you leave
the kid alone, please?

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:34.870
Raymond?
Stay out of this, please.

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:37.005
- You're not paying his tuition.
- Neither are you.

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:38.940
I finished last semester.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.543
I got my own shitty place
that I am paying for

01:04:41.545 --> 01:04:43.945
- with this shitty job.
- Hey, I like this place!

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:45.881
None of that even matters
because no matter what I do,

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:48.049
I'll never fucking
make you happy.

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.293
Okay. All right.

01:04:58.295 --> 01:04:59.427
Get up.
Let's go, we're leaving.

01:04:59.429 --> 01:05:02.230
- Get up.
- Now?!

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:04.432
- Yup, right now.
- -Why?

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:06.201
Why?
Because apparently,

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:09.137
I am the only person here
who seems to have

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.506
a fucking issue with your
husband's suicide mission.

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.909
Okay, so if everybody here
wants to do this, let's go.

01:05:13.911 --> 01:05:15.543
Let's go, let's get it done.
Let's go to Oregon.

01:05:15.545 --> 01:05:17.345
And I'm gonna call your daughter
and I'm gonna tell her

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:19.948
to get on the plane so that she
and your granddaughter,

01:05:19.950 --> 01:05:22.250
whose pills you seem
to <i> really</i> enjoy,

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:23.952
can both be there to watch.

01:05:23.954 --> 01:05:25.954
Didn't think I knew that,
did you, huh?

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:27.923
And Nick, why don't you
pack yourself a bag, bud?

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:29.457
We're gonna go watch grandpa
do himself in.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:31.393
- No fucking way.
- Yes, fucking way.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:33.929
- Don't make me ask you again.
- I can't. I have work.

01:05:33.931 --> 01:05:35.563
- Get it covered!
- Get it covered?

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:37.699
- Yes, get it covered!
- Whoa, whoa.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.334
Brian, Brian.

01:05:39.336 --> 01:05:41.403
Let me talk to him.

01:05:41.405 --> 01:05:43.705
- Let me talk to him.
- Okay. All right.

01:05:47.043 --> 01:05:49.010
What the fuck?

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.395
Shit.
Hey, Annie?

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:10.465
Can you grab my makeup bag
from my room, please?

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:13.234
- Yeah.
- Okay, thank you.

01:06:13.236 --> 01:06:15.303
All right, we're gonna be late.
Let's go.

01:06:15.305 --> 01:06:18.039
Okay, baby girl.

01:06:18.041 --> 01:06:19.407
You're not packed.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:21.076
What's wrong?

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:41.997
Brian, please put
that cigarette out!

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:44.366
<i>Honey, you really
don't have to go</i>

01:06:44.368 --> 01:06:46.067
<i>if you don't want to.</i>

01:06:46.069 --> 01:06:48.603
Are we really gonna go watch
grandpa kill himself?

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:50.572
What? No.
Oh, god, honey, no.

01:06:50.574 --> 01:06:52.007
No, no, no, no, no.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.541
But isn't that why he's there?

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:55.610
No, no...

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:57.512
Uh, I mean...

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:59.347
Yes, it...

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.617
But he's not going to.
He's not going to.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.019
Well, how do you know?

01:07:04.021 --> 01:07:05.687
Because I'm not gonna let him.

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.323
I just don't want to...

01:07:08.325 --> 01:07:10.792
Go and see somebody die.

01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:15.363
Especially not somebody I know.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.499
You know what?

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:20.301
I don't know what's gonna
happen. I'm just...

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:24.539
I'm scared.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.574
Why are you scared?

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:32.647
Because I'm scared
that maybe he will.

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.250
Don't cry, mom.

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:44.192
I need you
to come with me, okay?

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:35.810
Your mom
will be happy you're here.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.313
What?

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:41.149
Oh, uh, I said, your mom,
she gets in at 10:00.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:43.718
She'll be happy
that you're here.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.854
And I'm... I'm...
And I'm glad you came...

01:08:45.856 --> 01:08:48.389
- I'm happy you're here.
- I'm not here for you.

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.894
Okay, bud.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.471
All right, have a good night.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.830
Oh, shit.

01:10:38.634 --> 01:10:40.001
Hey, Danny, you...

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:10.865
Hey, bud, have you seen
grandpa or Danny?

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.667
They left.

01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:15.737
They left? Okay.
Well, are they going to...

01:11:15.739 --> 01:11:18.940
Are they gonna be back
in time for his appointment?

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:22.677
No.

01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:24.612
They're gone.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.381
I already said
goodbye to grandpa.

01:11:26.383 --> 01:11:27.782
Wait a second,
what are you talking about?

01:11:27.784 --> 01:11:30.018
- Where did they go?
- Just ask Danny.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.786
Where did they go?

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:35.990
He couldn't tell you.
Or mom.

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:39.294
You'd just turn the car around
and make him get surgery.

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.665
Anything but what he wants,
right, dad?

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.604
Hey.

01:11:49.606 --> 01:11:51.839
I need you to tell me
everything you know.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.983
They're calling.

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.386
Leave it.

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:13.207
There are better ways
to do this.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.068
I appreciate
your coming along, Danny.

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:29.577
Well, I wanted you to see
what support felt like.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:35.383
I could care less
who you slept with.

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.986
I just knew your life
was gonna be harder.

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:48.363
That's not how a father
protects his son.

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.064
Yeah, well...

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:54.102
You're not a father.

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:02.043
Uh, Estelle, you need
to get your clothes on.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:03.644
I'm getting some coffee.

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:05.480
No, no, no.
Ray and Danny are gone!

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:08.149
I know, it's fine.
If he wants to be denied

01:13:08.151 --> 01:13:10.618
by the same white coats
that replaced him,

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:13.121
I don't need to be there
to watch it.

01:13:13.123 --> 01:13:14.956
Kate's flight
is coming in early.

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:17.125
We really have to go right now,
and I need you to give me

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:19.060
all the information you have
about Ray's doctor here.

01:13:19.062 --> 01:13:21.162
What's going on here?
What are you doing?

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:22.864
You brought him
all the way out here.

01:13:22.866 --> 01:13:25.933
And now you want to stop him?
And you know what else?

01:13:25.935 --> 01:13:29.537
Don't you ever try
to embarrass me

01:13:29.539 --> 01:13:31.472
in front of my son
and grandson again.

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:35.176
If you want to ask me something,
you ask me, damn it!

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:38.746
Everyone expects me
to fight this and fix it

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:41.482
and... and try to coddle him
into living.

01:13:41.484 --> 01:13:43.885
You have no idea what it's like

01:13:43.887 --> 01:13:46.821
to live with a man who'd rather
die than be with you!

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:06.574
There's, um...

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:11.112
Something that ray
didn't tell you.

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.985
This is it?

01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.455
This doesn't look like
a doctor's office.

01:14:20.457 --> 01:14:21.722
It's not.

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:50.651
Harold.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.888
Raymond.
Oh, you made it.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.656
It's good to see you, Harold.

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:57.558
You remember my son Daniel?

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:59.126
- Yes, of course.
- Hi, Dr. Feldstein.

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:02.196
Are you still with that
medical nonprofit in Idaho?

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:05.800
Utah, yeah.
Going on nine years now.

01:15:05.802 --> 01:15:07.502
I want to say
I'm glad that you and Peter

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:09.136
connected about this.

01:15:09.138 --> 01:15:11.205
I... you know, I think it's
very important for you.

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:12.940
- So do I.
- Yeah.

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:16.043
I filled out all the appropriate
paperwork in my case.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:19.514
And I'd be really grateful
if you went over it with Danny.

01:15:19.516 --> 01:15:21.616
I will go over it,
and I will try to find

01:15:21.618 --> 01:15:23.651
- the right doctor for you.
- Thank you.

01:15:33.796 --> 01:15:36.130
<i>The white zone is for immediate</i>

01:15:36.132 --> 01:15:39.600
<i>loading and unloading
of passengers only.</i>

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.569
<i>No parking.</i>

01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:43.104
- Where's my dad?
- He's not here right now.

01:15:43.106 --> 01:15:44.705
I know, but where is he?

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:50.745
I guess you want to see Peter.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:53.080
Yes, I do.

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:56.918
He's gonna be
very happy to see you.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.586
Stay here and hold this.

01:15:58.588 --> 01:16:00.187
Who... who is Peter?

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:01.756
Just an old friend.

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:25.713
Dr. Engersol?
Hi, it's Maryanne.

01:16:25.715 --> 01:16:28.883
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:30.851
No, that's fine.
It's been a long time.

01:16:30.853 --> 01:16:34.288
I've changed.
He has been waiting for you.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:37.592
He's right in here.
He's right here.

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:42.363
Peter...
Look who's made it.

01:16:45.334 --> 01:16:47.234
Is that ray Engersol?

01:16:50.105 --> 01:16:51.772
Hello, Peter.

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:14.261
Dad?

01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:17.665
I'll be right back, okay?

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:19.934
If you need anything,
you just ring.

01:17:31.713 --> 01:17:33.014
- Ray?
- Yeah?

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:34.849
- Could you give me a hand here?
- Sure.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:42.189
Thank you.

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.991
I will send no bill.

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:51.032
Thanks for letting me
come see you today.

01:17:51.034 --> 01:17:54.168
I'm sure you had better things
to do this morning

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:58.305
than to watch an old friend
join the choir.

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:00.341
You should see my calendar.

01:18:09.217 --> 01:18:10.818
Yeah, open up the pills

01:18:10.820 --> 01:18:12.319
and put the powder inside there.

01:18:12.321 --> 01:18:16.023
Yeah, open them up.
Yeah, just like that, break it.

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:25.332
How many of these
does he need in here?

01:18:25.334 --> 01:18:27.068
We tell people

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:29.103
most of the bottle,
just to be safe.

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:31.405
Okay.

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:37.945
Hi. Uh, are y...

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.880
Are you with
Dr. Feldstein?

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.249
Oh, no, I'm s...
I'm sorry.

01:18:42.251 --> 01:18:44.919
I'm, um...
I'm Raymond's son.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:47.955
Oh, y-you're
Dr. Engersol's son.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:49.957
Yes, I'm sorry, I'll give
your family some privacy.

01:18:49.959 --> 01:18:51.792
No, no.
You got your dad here.

01:18:51.794 --> 01:18:54.795
And that was real important
to my father.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:57.431
So I'm...

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:59.433
Just please,
just make yourself at home.

01:18:59.435 --> 01:19:02.770
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:05.406
You're welcome.

01:19:05.408 --> 01:19:08.109
This is...
Just Seconal?

01:19:08.111 --> 01:19:12.012
Yep, just sleeping pills.

01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:13.414
How was the trip?

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:17.051
Not easy.
But then nothing is anymore.

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:20.988
Tell me about it.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:24.925
How's... how's Estelle?
Where is she?

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.994
She's in the cabin.
She's resting.

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:31.365
Estelle would not do well
with this kind of thing.

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.802
Well, she's gonna have to, huh?

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.842
Pete?

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.017
Are you ready?

01:19:51.254 --> 01:19:53.420
Look at me, ray.

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.189
What do you think?

01:20:00.162 --> 01:20:02.463
You, on the other hand,

01:20:02.465 --> 01:20:05.366
don't look so bad
for someone who's dying.

01:20:05.368 --> 01:20:08.936
Well, I've not yet
caught up to you.

01:20:11.373 --> 01:20:13.040
Are <i> you</i> ready?

01:20:17.579 --> 01:20:19.113
Yeah.

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:24.451
E-n-g-e-r-s-o-l, he's a
patient of Dr. Feldstein's.

01:20:24.453 --> 01:20:25.953
I don't have that information.

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:25.953
I'm sure you do
have the information

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:28.422
because he did have
an appointment here

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.424
today with Dr. Feldstein,
I don't need his...

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:33.928
Okay I just...
I just need some information

01:20:33.930 --> 01:20:35.930
on my father because he was
supposed to be here today

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:38.065
but we can't find him and we
think he might be in danger.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:39.967
- So can you please help me?
- I'm sorry, but as I said.

01:20:39.969 --> 01:20:41.602
I don't have that information
and even if I did,

01:20:41.604 --> 01:20:44.205
it wouldn't be within my rights
to give it to you.

01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:45.906
- Oh, Jesus, you're kidding me.
- I'm so sorry.

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:48.976
Fine, fine.
Did you try Danny again?

01:20:50.312 --> 01:20:51.612
Brian!
Did you call Danny?!

01:20:51.614 --> 01:20:53.380
What?
Yes. His phone is off.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.283
Can you help me with this?

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:59.053
No, I'm sorry.
It has to be you.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:03.624
It has to be me.

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:06.026
So, when you're done with that,

01:21:06.028 --> 01:21:08.329
we're gonna fill it up
with water.

01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:11.131
And then he has to drink
the whole thing.

01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:13.500
It's not gonna taste very good.

01:21:13.502 --> 01:21:15.569
So, is there something he likes

01:21:15.571 --> 01:21:19.473
to chase it with?
Orange juice or something?

01:21:19.475 --> 01:21:21.375
Mm-hmm.
I've got something.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:24.578
It's, um, apricot nectar.
He always loved it.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.947
- Perfect.
- Okay.

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:29.450
- Just keep going, huh?
- Yup.

01:21:33.221 --> 01:21:35.623
Your father would like
to see you.

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.892
He's ready.

01:21:37.894 --> 01:21:39.393
I'll give you the room.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:49.603
Okay.

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:56.110
Just i... just...
I need to finish this, okay?

01:21:56.112 --> 01:21:58.078
I'll be in in a minute.

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:05.019
I can do this.
He's my dad.

01:22:09.991 --> 01:22:12.559
Before we go any further, Peter,

01:22:12.561 --> 01:22:16.563
I have to ask you those
two questions we talked about.

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:18.666
Would you like
to change your mind?

01:22:18.668 --> 01:22:22.002
I would not, Candace.

01:22:22.004 --> 01:22:24.338
But thank you, though.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:30.144
And thank everybody here,

01:22:30.146 --> 01:22:32.513
and especially you.

01:22:32.515 --> 01:22:35.115
Thank you for understanding.

01:22:38.053 --> 01:22:41.121
I loved my life...

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:43.090
And all of you.

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:48.062
But it's time.

01:22:49.698 --> 01:22:52.366
One last question, Peter.

01:22:52.368 --> 01:22:55.302
What will taking
this medication do to you?

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.679
Kill me dead.

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:12.619
Maryanne, you can
give that to your dad.

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:21.495
I love you.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:26.600
I am proud of you.

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:30.604
We've had a great time, huh?

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:37.344
There's no rush.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:30.891
Is that you in there, dad?

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:38.432
You got the whole family
together...

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:40.834
In Oregon...

01:25:40.836 --> 01:25:42.736
Where it all started.

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:51.178
What now?

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:19.173
It's Danny.

01:26:59.814 --> 01:27:01.381
Hey, bud.

01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:02.809
Huh?!
How could you not tell me?!

01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:04.978
Huh?! How could you
not tell me?!

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:06.413
This is a family decision,

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:07.681
and you stole that
from me, Danny,

01:28:07.683 --> 01:28:08.849
you stole that from me.

01:28:08.851 --> 01:28:12.286
It was <i> his</i> decision, Kate.

01:28:18.693 --> 01:28:19.793
Daddy...

01:28:21.796 --> 01:28:23.930
Daddy?

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.526
Why would you do that?

01:28:52.528 --> 01:28:53.927
Because I'm the only one
who could.

01:28:53.929 --> 01:28:55.595
He's my father, too!
He lives with me!

01:28:55.597 --> 01:28:59.466
He relies on me!
You haven't existed for years!

01:28:59.468 --> 01:29:01.735
- You're too close.
- What?!

01:29:01.737 --> 01:29:03.403
- You're too close.
- Fuck you!

01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:09.009
What the fuck, man.
Where were you?

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:14.047
He is gonna qualify, Brian.

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:22.422
What is that?
Brian, what is...

01:29:22.424 --> 01:29:26.426
Brian, what does it say?
What does that say?

01:29:26.428 --> 01:29:28.695
What does it say?
No, no, no, he can't do this.

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.864
He can't do this, Brian.
He can't do this.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:32.833
He can't do this.

01:31:21.175 --> 01:31:23.877
I can't go through
the surgery again, Estelle.

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:28.748
I just can't.

01:31:34.155 --> 01:31:36.122
I still want to die.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.028
But I don't want to die...

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.602
With all this anger.

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:54.274
I don't want to die...

01:31:57.512 --> 01:32:00.580
With you and the kids hating me.

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:09.923
I'll just live
until I can't live anymore.

01:32:09.925 --> 01:32:12.692
I don't care about the pain,
but...

01:32:15.296 --> 01:32:16.730
Please...

01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:24.971
Please help me fix our family.
