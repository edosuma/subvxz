00:30.360 --> 00:33.599
Ms Ross? Er, Kirsten Ross?

00:33.720 --> 00:34.759
Yes?

00:34.920 --> 00:37.839
I'm Detective Inspector
Phillip Hamilton...

00:37.920 --> 00:40.519
My God, is Carl all right?

00:40.600 --> 00:41.999
Is Carl okay?

00:42.080 --> 00:43.519
Perhaps if I...

00:43.600 --> 00:45.479
Of course. I'm sorry. Please...

00:47.080 --> 00:51.239
Before I go on, I might ask
if there's anyone else at home?

00:52.040 --> 00:54.239
Anyone who might, um, be able to help?

00:54.640 --> 00:59.319
No. No. I'm waiting for...
Oh, God, is he all right?

01:16.880 --> 01:18.919
Your husband will be home soon.

01:20.480 --> 01:22.319
Either he opens the door
to find his wife

01:22.400 --> 01:24.239
and baby spread all over the carpet,

01:24.320 --> 01:29.519
or he comes home to find the baby
safely asleep in its cot,

01:29.600 --> 01:31.719
but his wife gone.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.599
So Kirsten...

01:35.240 --> 01:36.479
Which is it to be?

02:06.200 --> 02:11.919
♪ Love is like a sin, my love

02:13.400 --> 02:19.599
♪ For the ones
that feel it the most

02:20.560 --> 02:26.639
♪ Look at her
with her eyes like a flame

02:27.480 --> 02:31.039
♪ She will love you like a fly

02:31.120 --> 02:35.199
♪ will never love you again ♪

02:54.520 --> 02:56.159
Why all the secrecy?

02:56.240 --> 02:58.919
I want your unadulterated impressions.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.599
Unadulterated by what?

03:00.680 --> 03:02.639
Rumours. Just go in.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.599
It's blood.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.799
The victim?

03:30.880 --> 03:33.799
Kirsten Ross. Thirty-two.
Missing, presumed abducted.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.439
- She's got a young child?
- Leo Ross, yeah, three months old.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.039
Is the baby all right?

03:41.240 --> 03:45.719
Untouched. Father comes home,
sees all this, imagines the worst.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.639
What, you think he did this? The father?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.439
No, I'm not thinking that.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.119
"Do not fear the abyss,
for I am the abyss

03:57.200 --> 04:00.759
"and thou shalt weep with the
fervour and bliss of my love."

04:03.720 --> 04:06.079
Blimey. Satanism?

04:07.240 --> 04:09.559
Are you superstitious
about that sort of thing?

04:09.640 --> 04:11.559
Not so much, no. Not as a rule.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.759
But this is pretty weird.

04:14.880 --> 04:16.399
The writing?

04:16.560 --> 04:19.879
- Same hand. Same writer.
- What hand? What writer?

04:24.760 --> 04:28.559
Ten years ago Grace Allen
was abducted from her home.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.799
Her baby was asleep upstairs.
Unhurt. No sign of struggle.

04:31.880 --> 04:36.399
Her husband comes home,
finds his hallway looking like this.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.959
Same writing. Same words.

04:39.160 --> 04:42.199
Three months later, the investigation
received an anonymous tip,

04:42.280 --> 04:45.159
some bloke who claims to be
an accomplice of this man...

04:45.760 --> 04:48.799
Lucien Burgess. Burgess is a rich kid.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.199
But he's born with bad blood.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.439
Aged 30, he's got his own
little black magic cult

04:52.520 --> 04:55.399
derived on the writings
of Aleister Crowley.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.719
Who called himself "The Great Beast".

04:57.800 --> 05:00.759
- The blood on the walls?
- Human and fresh.

05:00.840 --> 05:02.399
Tapped from a living source.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.679
Human body's got six litres of it.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.799
Tap a little bit at a time,
over a few weeks,

05:06.880 --> 05:09.359
you've got a whole body's worth of blood
to splash around.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.639
- But no corpse.
- And the handwriting?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.439
Burgess favours the right.

05:13.520 --> 05:15.599
Whoever wrote on the walls
favours the left.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.919
They were confident they had their man,
but they had nothing on him.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.879
So an undercover operation
was authorised.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.079
It went wrong.
While he was supposed to be undercover

05:24.160 --> 05:27.959
DS Richard Henley attempted
to make an arrest.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.319
He did this...

05:30.400 --> 05:33.559
All but killed him. Henley does
three and a half years for GBH.

05:33.640 --> 05:36.279
Burgess gets rich
on government compensation.

05:36.480 --> 05:39.439
Then sells his story to the tabloids,
richer still.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.039
Publishes a memoir, richer still.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.519
A year after all this,

05:43.600 --> 05:47.279
Grace Allen's body turns up
right next to a railway siding.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.519
She'd been frozen post-mortem.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.319
When they found her,
she'd been completely exsanguinated.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.359
Burgess had drained her blood.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.679
Forensics confirm.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.279
The writing on the wall tonight
was in Grace Allen's blood.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.839
- Still fresh, ten years later.
- That must be enough to pick him up?

06:04.920 --> 06:06.159
Well, yeah. Ordinarily.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.879
But the last time the police
went after him,

06:07.960 --> 06:10.639
we caused a full-blown media
and political shit-storm.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.639
Kirsten Ross is probably still alive
and out there right now.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.359
Finding her is our highest priority,

06:15.440 --> 06:17.119
but not our sole priority.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.599
It's imperative
we stay clear of Burgess.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.279
We don't so much as cast
a glance in his direction

06:22.360 --> 06:23.919
until we've got something bulletproof.

07:04.240 --> 07:07.159
Let me go.
Please let me out.

07:07.240 --> 07:09.359
I need to see my baby.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.919
- Are you Mark North?
- Yeah?

07:59.720 --> 08:00.999
Hi!

08:02.320 --> 08:05.679
Oh, my God... What happened?

08:06.200 --> 08:08.119
- They were waiting for me.
- Who?

08:08.200 --> 08:10.519
- Whoever did this.
- What do you mean?

08:10.600 --> 08:12.519
He sent girls.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.159
He sent girls to do it.
That man is a genius.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.599
- He wouldn't.
- You think?

08:21.120 --> 08:22.919
Let me have a look.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.879
Let me have a look.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.959
According to the literature,
if the Left-Handed Man actually existed,

08:28.040 --> 08:31.399
he'd be an acolyte, follower,
a submissive personality.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.558
What? An apostle that betrays
his master to the police

08:35.640 --> 08:38.119
and then still works with him,
ten years later?

08:38.200 --> 08:39.639
That doesn't sound right to me.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.479
So what... What are we saying then?

08:42.559 --> 08:44.919
Well, Burgess wants fame, doesn't he?
He wants infamy.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.079
He wants to humiliate the police.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.719
We had his handwriting analysed.

08:48.800 --> 08:49.999
Tried to make him
write with his left hand

08:50.080 --> 08:51.319
and he couldn't do it.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.879
Yeah, but it's still not right,
though, is it?

08:54.720 --> 08:58.199
Grace Allen's ten-year-old blood
shows up

08:58.280 --> 09:00.199
at Kirsten Ross's house tonight.

09:00.600 --> 09:04.639
And the blood on the walls
at Grace Allen's house was human too.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.319
- The source was never identified.
- Never.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.719
Maybe they weren't
looking in the right place.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.439
You know, maybe they were thinking
it was as fresh as it looked.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.879
So it could have come from another
victim, an even earlier victim?

09:19.960 --> 09:21.199
Yeah, maybe a lot earlier.

09:21.280 --> 09:27.079
Do me a favour. Dig around cold cases
unsolved with similar indications.

09:31.920 --> 09:36.559
John. DCI Luther's phone, DS Ripley.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.679
Oh, brilliant, yeah. Cheers.

09:41.400 --> 09:44.279
- Boss. Boss.
- Yeah?

09:45.200 --> 09:46.479
I lost you for a minute there.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.799
- Yes, sorry I do that. What?
- Your undercover guy's here.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.999
Oh, God. He looks like shit.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.159
DCI John Luther, Richard Henley.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.519
I really appreciate you coming in.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.319
Well, they didn't give me much choice.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.519
Why don't you, er,
use the interview room?

09:59.680 --> 10:00.679
Yeah.

10:12.760 --> 10:17.279
Benny... Sorry about the hour, mate.
I need a favour, can you get over here?

10:21.480 --> 10:22.719
Oh, Alice.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.479
So I'm returning home, I'm parking,
same place, same time as usual.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.279
And they walk from up the street,
but it's the...

10:40.360 --> 10:42.599
It's the stiff arm by the side,
you know,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.439
what is that about, why do they do that?

10:44.520 --> 10:47.119
"They"? Who exactly are "they"?

10:47.200 --> 10:49.999
These, these hoodies, these kids.
These girls.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.759
- Girls?
- Girls. And so, I'm surrounded.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.439
And one of them says,
"Are you Mark North?"

10:56.760 --> 10:59.879
I say, "Yeah". Bang, I'm on the floor
having the shit kicked out of me.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.839
And then the same girl

11:03.400 --> 11:05.599
says, "John says hello".

11:06.800 --> 11:09.119
"John says hello"?

11:09.560 --> 11:10.559
Word for word.

11:12.520 --> 11:13.639
Please.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.599
The truth is, Richard, we're nowhere.

11:30.520 --> 11:33.799
All right, we've got SOCOS at the house,
bodies on the street.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.559
He won't have left you anything.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.959
Not at all.

11:37.840 --> 11:40.519
And the clock is
ticking on Kirsten Ross.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.319
- I'm not a copper any more.
- Yes, you are.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.199
There was a...

11:53.720 --> 11:55.999
A lot of sex stuff.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.319
Did he use blood? In your presence?

12:02.640 --> 12:05.479
He said all bodily fluids were powerful.

12:06.520 --> 12:12.879
Semen, vaginal secretions, blood.
Menstrual blood was best.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.119
I mean what did he do with it?

12:17.880 --> 12:21.599
Well, all that stuff had to be
taken into the body. In various ways.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.119
And you had to...

12:25.560 --> 12:27.799
I let him do anything he wanted.

12:28.800 --> 12:29.839
Richard,

12:30.280 --> 12:32.559
whatever happened, whatever you

12:33.080 --> 12:35.479
allowed to happen to you,

12:36.200 --> 12:38.399
all right, you did something valiant.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.719
And every copper in this shop
knows that.

12:42.320 --> 12:43.679
It didn't help though, did it?

12:55.040 --> 12:57.559
How did you end up beating him?

12:59.680 --> 13:01.879
I'd been undercover for 15 months.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.799
Thought I'd won his trust.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.959
This one night, we're at his flat

13:08.280 --> 13:09.999
and he gives me a glass of wine.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.519
I drink it,

13:13.000 --> 13:14.959
wake up tied to a chair.

13:15.880 --> 13:19.159
It turns out, he'd known
I was police from day one.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.919
He showed me a picture of Grace Allen.
She was alive.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.839
And in the picture right next
to her face, that day's paper.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.239
And he said,

13:30.800 --> 13:33.519
"This is the closest you'll ever come."

13:34.080 --> 13:37.079
And he set light to the picture
and burnt it right in front of me.

13:39.400 --> 13:40.679
Then he cut me loose.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.239
And that's when you did that?

13:46.680 --> 13:47.799
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.559
That's what I did.

14:55.600 --> 14:57.519
You are radiant.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.199
Shh.

15:19.480 --> 15:20.879
Are you ready?

15:29.200 --> 15:30.359
Who's that in there?

15:30.760 --> 15:32.959
Oh, that's, er, Richard Henley.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.639
- Ex-copper Richard Henley?
- Yeah.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.239
Well, Officer Lieutenant.

15:38.280 --> 15:40.319
- Who's in there with the duchess?
- Erm...

15:41.280 --> 15:43.159
Oh, that's Mark North.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.279
- Right.
- Mmm.

15:46.520 --> 15:49.039
- Busy night, eh?
- I'll say.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.119
She was naked,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.279
and, er,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.959
in some kind of box,

15:58.960 --> 16:01.799
er, rectangular, not coffin-shaped.

16:01.880 --> 16:04.359
It was, er, shorter, deeper.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.919
She was tied at the wrists
and ankles with a...

16:07.600 --> 16:10.759
I don't know.
It was too dark to see properly.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.719
Er, her eyes were

16:17.040 --> 16:20.079
like a horse's eyes,
when it's terrified.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.679
How could you, um,

16:25.880 --> 16:28.959
how could you read the paper?

16:29.040 --> 16:33.079
- Sorry?
- You said the box, it was too dark

16:33.160 --> 16:34.759
to see details of the straps.

16:34.840 --> 16:38.279
But you read the headline,
you could see her eyes, how?

16:38.800 --> 16:40.759
There was a light across her face.

16:40.840 --> 16:43.279
- A reflection of the flash or something.
- A light?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.759
Like a crescent of light.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.279
It was her eyes that did it.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.599
I wanted to kill him.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.199
I knew it would cost me.
But I didn't care.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.719
And to this day,

17:00.800 --> 17:03.279
the biggest regret of my life
is not killing the...

17:05.560 --> 17:07.878
Any idea

17:07.960 --> 17:09.719
what it's like to feel like that?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.239
Yes, I do.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.598
I know exactly what that feels like.

18:22.640 --> 18:27.079
Leave me alone, leave me alone...

18:37.720 --> 18:40.319
Three guesses why Zoe's
gentleman caller was here?

18:41.200 --> 18:42.759
To confess he's a dick?

18:42.840 --> 18:44.759
He's been assaulted.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.359
- Good.
- He blames you.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.719
Oh, come on.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.599
You've already come close
to one suspension for assaulting him.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.519
So I'm pretty much obliged
to take this seriously.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.319
The man is a fantasist.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.399
The marks on his face aren't fantasies.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.519
Guv, all due respect, Kirsten Ross is
out there alive right now.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.439
And you bother me with this?

19:05.200 --> 19:06.199
Seriously?

19:10.160 --> 19:11.639
Okay.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.399
I'll take my time
entering the paperwork.

19:14.480 --> 19:17.359
But I will be entering it,
first thing tomorrow.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.799
Unless Mark North withdraws
his complaint before then.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.119
If he does,
no-one need know this ever happened.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.119
Thank you.

19:28.320 --> 19:30.319
Yeah, so go! Sod off! Speak to him.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.839
Be nice. Beg, if you have to.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.279
I ran the blood
from the Grace Allen cold case

19:42.360 --> 19:43.639
through every available database.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.559
We got a match.
Precious Akingbade was found

19:46.640 --> 19:47.879
on the banks of a canal in Birmingham.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.399
Exsanguinated and genitally mutilated.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.039
I remember this. This was years ago.

19:52.120 --> 19:54.079
Yeah, 20 years ago. 1990.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.559
Two different murders,
completely different MOs.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.879
Separated by a decade
and half a country.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.999
You know, Burgess must've been

20:03.200 --> 20:05.159
20 years old when he done this?

20:07.480 --> 20:10.719
Benny, I appreciate you coming in.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.679
That's okay.
I was just immersed in the world of, er,

20:12.760 --> 20:15.239
King Crimson and the World of Warcraft.

20:15.320 --> 20:18.039
Er, as much as I love you,
I can't pretend to know what that is.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.599
What I'm trying to say is,

20:20.680 --> 20:23.119
do I smell like someone
who's been smoking marijuana?

20:23.840 --> 20:25.199
A little bit.

20:25.360 --> 20:27.039
D'you think anybody's going to notice?

20:29.560 --> 20:31.879
See if you can ID these girls.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.119
Quietly as you can.

20:35.240 --> 20:36.479
You okay?

20:36.560 --> 20:39.239
I will be,
once you tell me who they are.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.719
Give me an hour or two. Or three.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.679
Boss?

20:46.120 --> 20:49.319
Burgess runs a little occult bookshop.
They sell on-line.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.279
Do you think Burgess
will be at work today?

20:51.440 --> 20:53.199
He's got to make it
look like a normal day.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.679
Pay him a little visit.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.959
John. You come here today? Seriously?

21:24.960 --> 21:26.079
Mark?

21:27.640 --> 21:28.639
Mark.

21:32.160 --> 21:33.839
Oh, dear.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.399
Mark, I had nothing to do with this.

21:37.480 --> 21:40.879
What you did, John,
I understand it, all right?

21:41.480 --> 21:45.439
It so, in a brutal way,
just kind of sums you up, I suppose.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.199
- But look at my face. Look.
- All right...

21:47.280 --> 21:49.759
If you do this, all right,

21:49.840 --> 21:53.319
there's an innocent woman
out there is gonna get hurt.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.199
It's got nothing to do with this,
you, me, or the rest of it.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.679
John, you cannot keep
saying to Zoe that you love her,

21:59.760 --> 22:01.879
and then putting her through this.

22:01.960 --> 22:05.039
You have to stop.
Stop for her, stop for you. Stop.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.199
Listen to me, Mark.
I'm asking you as nicely as I can.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.639
Don't do this to me.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.039
And what exactly are you saying?
If you're going to threaten me,

22:15.720 --> 22:17.119
why don't you make a proper job of it?

22:17.200 --> 22:19.399
Say it out loud,
so we all know where we stand.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.239
Zoe.

22:37.000 --> 22:39.119
There were lots of things
I wish I had told you,

22:39.200 --> 22:41.839
things that I did that I was ashamed of,

22:43.000 --> 22:44.799
afraid of.

22:46.360 --> 22:50.359
I didn't talk to you,
but at least I didn't lie.

22:50.440 --> 22:54.319
Okay? Like I am not lying now.
Mark, I didn't do this to you.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.639
I really need you to trust me on this.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.199
Alice, what are you playing at?

23:16.920 --> 23:18.599
I thought you wanted Zoe back.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.599
And you do it by getting
me blamed for beating up Mark North?

23:22.040 --> 23:24.399
Getting me fired?
I'm in serious trouble,

23:24.480 --> 23:25.559
more trouble than you think!

23:25.960 --> 23:27.799
You won't lose your job.

23:27.880 --> 23:30.319
- Or your wife.
- Alice, do me a favour.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.319
Stop interfering!

23:32.400 --> 23:35.199
All right, please, no more helping.
Can you do that?

24:06.360 --> 24:07.439
John?

24:09.080 --> 24:10.559
Yeah. How'd you know that?

24:10.800 --> 24:12.199
We do most of our trade on-line

24:12.280 --> 24:13.919
or by appointment.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.679
So...

24:17.240 --> 24:18.719
I'm all yours.

24:20.720 --> 24:21.959
What's your pleasure?

24:22.200 --> 24:24.039
Five hundred quid

24:25.760 --> 24:29.959
for a poem hand illustrated
by the Yorkshire Ripper.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.599
Seven hundred and fifty quid
for a letter

24:34.760 --> 24:37.959
from the Ripper to
a female correspondent. Wow.

24:38.040 --> 24:41.359
Well, that includes
a small self-portrait.

24:41.440 --> 24:44.679
Sutcliffe snuggling up to a woman.

24:46.160 --> 24:47.319
Large breasted.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.399
Hmm.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.199
But you know there's
nothing new under the sun.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.759
There used to be quite a trade

24:54.840 --> 24:57.879
in handkerchiefs dipped
in the blood of hanged men.

24:57.960 --> 25:03.959
Hair clippings, snuff boxes,
garters, cravat pins.

25:04.280 --> 25:05.559
Who would buy them?

25:06.040 --> 25:07.559
Young women, mostly.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.839
Wow, young women?

25:11.680 --> 25:13.679
Even stuff like this?

25:14.280 --> 25:15.759
Peter Kurten,

25:15.840 --> 25:17.959
the Vampire of Dusseldorf.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.479
Richard Trenton Chase, the Vampire of
Sacramento. Women buy this stuff?

25:22.880 --> 25:25.639
It's a kink. A sex thing.

25:27.480 --> 25:34.079
Many, many women fantasise
about being tied up, strangled,

25:34.600 --> 25:37.479
raped, eaten.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.239
You think so?

25:39.320 --> 25:40.599
Oh, yeah.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.239
The more depraved the killer,
the more women fawn on him.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.279
It's called hybristophilia.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.839
Sexual arousal
from thoughts of violence.

25:50.520 --> 25:53.679
It's his willingness to murder
that attracts her.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.559
His murder becomes hers.

25:57.520 --> 25:58.719
Hmm.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.719
- Well, I have a confession.
- Really?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.279
Yeah.

26:09.160 --> 26:12.559
- My autobiography. You're a fan?
- You got me.

26:13.200 --> 26:17.359
Course you know, if I sign this,
its resale value increases hugely.

26:17.440 --> 26:19.079
I'll be putting money in your pocket.

26:19.520 --> 26:21.439
- I know.
- You're a dealer?

26:21.520 --> 26:24.199
Collector. And I'm paying.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.959
Well, it's two hundred and fifty.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.479
- You serious?
- Oh, yes.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.879
I've quite the following.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.959
Well, you've got yourself a deal.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.559
There you go.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.439
Good catch.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.639
There you are.

27:06.440 --> 27:09.799
- Sacrificial Lamb.
- Yeah.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.759
Yeah, well...

28:30.960 --> 28:33.679
I learnt with terrible horror
this morning

28:33.760 --> 28:36.239
of the disappearance of Kirsten Ross.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.799
My heart goes out to her
and to her family,

28:38.880 --> 28:41.559
especially her husband
and her little daughter.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.799
Having already received a visit
this morning from a man who I believe

28:45.880 --> 28:47.519
to have been a police officer,

28:47.680 --> 28:51.239
I've called this press conference
in anticipation of my arrest.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.879
I want to say publicly,

28:54.000 --> 28:58.479
while I'm still able, that I had
nothing to do with this crime,

28:58.640 --> 29:00.039
nor the crime...

29:03.600 --> 29:06.199
Nor the crime against poor Grace Allen.

29:07.080 --> 29:12.999
I pray that this time, the Police
Service can see past its own prejudice

29:13.080 --> 29:16.279
and its own desire to seek
a sacrificial lamb.

29:17.760 --> 29:20.159
- Thank you.
- Mr Burgess will now take questions.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.639
Burgess has taken absolute control
of this investigation.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.719
We can't go near him.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.959
He can't let Kirsten Ross live now.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.919
Well, not for too long,
I mean, he can't afford to.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.919
Now that he knows we're
on his back like this.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.439
The order was stay away from him!

29:39.520 --> 29:40.999
Boss, he prepared the whole thing,

29:41.120 --> 29:43.319
the abduction,
the press conference, everything.

29:43.400 --> 29:45.079
So Kirsten Ross dies a lonely death

29:45.160 --> 29:48.159
while the media ensure
we can't go near our only suspect?

29:53.680 --> 29:57.359
Right, I submitted
Mark North's statement this morning.

29:57.600 --> 29:59.159
Oh, God. Don't take me off this.

29:59.240 --> 30:02.599
Not because of him.
I can find Kirsten. I can find her!

30:02.880 --> 30:05.639
I fought your corner and I fought it
hard, nobody wants you off this.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.519
- All right. But what?
- But...

30:08.240 --> 30:09.599
There are caveats.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.639
What caveats?

30:12.080 --> 30:13.559
Mr Schenk.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.359
Martin Schenk.

30:19.440 --> 30:20.679
Complaints.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.039
I know this isn't a good day,
so all I ask is five minutes.

30:25.120 --> 30:28.279
You and I sit down,
have a chat, put this silliness to bed.

30:28.680 --> 30:31.959
Absolutely. It's just that
I have an abduction on at the moment

30:32.040 --> 30:33.839
and time's running out for my victim.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.759
Do you mind if I just brief
Sergeant Ripley about something?

30:36.840 --> 30:38.599
Absolutely.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.039
Keep the train moving.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.799
That man is about to suspend me.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.079
He can't do that, can he?

30:45.160 --> 30:48.199
Can, has to and will.
So we got to work real quick.

30:48.280 --> 30:51.519
Still nothing solid. No forensics,
eyewitnesses, CCTV. Nothing.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.959
So revisit the cold cases.
What did Burgess leave behind?

30:54.040 --> 30:56.159
- Nothing. The man's a ghost.
- We know that about him.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.239
All we're looking for is where
he kept Precious and Grace

30:58.320 --> 31:00.119
between abduction
and dumping the bodies.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.199
Hmm.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.079
Precious Akingbade lived
and died in Birmingham.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.799
I can't see anything that
links Burgess to the Midlands.

31:05.880 --> 31:07.799
No, forget the distance between them.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.599
What do the dumpsites have in common?

31:09.680 --> 31:12.079
Precious Akingbade was
dumped by the side of a canal.

31:12.160 --> 31:15.759
Yeah, and Grace Allen was dumped here.
Easy access to the roadway.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.159
But less than a hundred metres
from a waterway.

31:18.880 --> 31:22.719
Henley said there was
a crescent of light

31:22.880 --> 31:24.559
across the Grace Allen picture.

31:24.680 --> 31:26.879
Bright enough to read the headlines.
A reflection, a flash.

31:27.080 --> 31:29.999
So that's what he said it looked like.
What if it wasn't that?

31:30.120 --> 31:34.039
What if it was daylight
coming in through a round window?

31:35.520 --> 31:36.959
He's got a boat.

31:37.840 --> 31:40.279
I've got to get out of here. Cover me.

31:51.880 --> 31:53.759
I was waiting for DCI Luther.

31:54.640 --> 31:57.479
Um, last time I saw him, sir,
he was headed that way.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.079
Which way?

31:59.160 --> 32:01.639
- That way?
- Er, absolutely, yeah.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.559
So what do you want?

32:17.240 --> 32:19.399
I need you to help me catch someone.

32:19.480 --> 32:23.079
I was under the impression
you wanted me to stop helping.

32:24.160 --> 32:25.279
Don't push it.

32:25.480 --> 32:28.079
How do I know you're not
playing a double game?

32:28.160 --> 32:30.319
One stone, multiple birds.

32:31.280 --> 32:34.679
Trying to make me speak carelessly
in order to entrap me.

32:34.760 --> 32:38.319
That would be illegal.
Plus I really need to catch this man.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.279
More than you want to catch me?

32:41.360 --> 32:42.839
At the moment, yeah.

32:43.800 --> 32:44.839
I'm running out of time.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.999
Because if I thought you were
about to lose interest in me...

32:49.720 --> 32:50.919
I'd be inconsolable.

32:51.520 --> 32:53.639
I just need a way in,

32:54.400 --> 32:57.239
to know what it's like to be him.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.359
To not feel anything.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.239
I feel things.

33:01.560 --> 33:04.199
- Not mercy.
- Not sentiment.

33:04.280 --> 33:07.239
I can't empathise
with this man's state of being

33:07.320 --> 33:08.679
any more than you can.

33:08.760 --> 33:12.959
Because,
disregarding a single, alleged act,

33:13.400 --> 33:15.759
carried out for different
alleged reasons,

33:15.840 --> 33:18.439
he and I might just as well be
from different species.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.439
See, I disagree.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.319
- Murder's murder.
- But it isn't, is it?

33:25.760 --> 33:27.159
Not even to you.

33:28.560 --> 33:30.199
This man Burgess,

33:30.720 --> 33:33.839
he's just a naughty child showing off.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.039
You already know his flaw,

33:37.560 --> 33:39.679
his compulsion to dominate,
to be in control.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.639
And you already know

33:41.720 --> 33:43.799
how to exploit that.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.879
- How?
- Oh, come on.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.239
Change the state of play.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.559
Yeah, well, I tried that with you...

34:01.480 --> 34:03.119
...and it failed.

34:05.040 --> 34:06.559
Only just.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.478
Ripley.

34:27.639 --> 34:31.279
Um, will do. Okay. Yeah. Right away.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.438
Um, DCI Luther's waiting for me outside.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.559
I'm very much obliged to you,
Detective Sergeant Ripley.

34:39.239 --> 34:40.239
No problem, sir.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.279
- Go on.
- So I went through

34:53.360 --> 34:56.159
every record of stolen boats
from 1988 to 1991.

34:56.239 --> 34:57.559
- And?
- First, there's way many.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.159
Turns out boats get stolen a lot.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.639
So I'm thinking,
he needs a vessel that can

35:00.720 --> 35:03.079
navigate canals in Birmingham.
That cuts the list.

35:03.960 --> 35:07.079
All these were reported stolen in '89,
just before the last recession,

35:07.160 --> 35:10.719
when there were lots of bogus insurance
claims. Six stolen boats, six owners.

35:11.120 --> 35:13.199
I cross-referenced the names
against Burgess's known history.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.359
What'd you find?

35:14.440 --> 35:18.479
Louis Gallant. Claimed for a stolen
narrowboat, the Julia, in July 1989.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.399
Suspected fraudulent claim,
never proven.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.199
- Connection to Burgess?
- Friends at Cambridge.

35:23.280 --> 35:25.359
Burgess and Gallant
were arrested together

35:25.440 --> 35:28.199
on a charge of possession
with intent to supply crack cocaine.

35:28.480 --> 35:31.279
That's a pretty big charge
for two middle-class white boys in '89.

35:31.360 --> 35:34.279
Burgess takes the rap for it,
does a bit of time, Gallant walks.

35:34.440 --> 35:35.679
So he was in debt to Burgess.

35:35.760 --> 35:36.959
All we got to do is...

35:37.040 --> 35:40.079
Already done it. Louis Gallant is
a family man with a serious job,

35:40.160 --> 35:42.599
he's looking more credit crunched
by the hour and mortgaged up the wazoo.

35:42.680 --> 35:45.239
I got everything for a promise
not to drag him through court.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.879
- So he sold the boat to Burgess?
- No, he gave it to him.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.719
Even helped him forge
a new registration number,

35:49.800 --> 35:51.279
which is easily done, apparently.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.919
So Burgess renames the boat the Isis.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.639
I've got a copy of the agreement
for berth, housing boat certificate,

35:55.720 --> 35:57.999
British Waterways Certificate,
Council Tax, insurance,

35:58.080 --> 36:01.279
Boat Safety Certificate. They all show
he's moored at St Katharine's Dock.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.999
Now the bad news.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.919
All these documents are in the name
of this guy, Brian Summers.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.879
Oh, bollocks!

36:07.960 --> 36:11.359
So what are you saying? Burgess used
a proxy to get the licenses?

36:11.440 --> 36:14.959
A friend, out of work actor, junkie,
con-artist from prison, who knows?

36:15.040 --> 36:18.119
I tell you what,
if we want to search this boat,

36:18.200 --> 36:19.919
we have to make it part
of the investigation.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.239
The only way to do that is to prove
that Brian Summers didn't exist.

36:23.600 --> 36:26.879
We could spend weeks of due diligence,
just chasing our tails around.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.919
Insufficient evidence,
search warrant denied.

36:30.360 --> 36:31.639
We go upstairs with that,
they'll say, "Go away,

36:31.720 --> 36:34.199
"you haven't done enough,
do your homework".

36:34.280 --> 36:39.119
Kirsten Ross dies, Burgess
dumps the body and walks. Again.

36:39.880 --> 36:42.559
- All right, so what do we do?
- Forget the rule book.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.239
Change the state of play.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.439
All right?

37:56.320 --> 38:00.039
Kirsten? Kirsten Ross?
If you can hear me,

38:00.480 --> 38:02.439
I'm John Luther, I'm a police officer.

38:02.520 --> 38:05.119
We're here to get you
back to your family.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.839
Oi!

38:30.120 --> 38:31.479
Don't.

38:31.560 --> 38:32.599
Don't what?

38:32.920 --> 38:34.119
Just don't.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.399
What are you saying?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.519
We weren't here.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.559
That isn't what we said.

38:41.640 --> 38:43.879
We said if she was here,
we'd call it in.

38:43.960 --> 38:45.359
Claim exigent circumstances.

38:45.440 --> 38:46.959
If she was alive!

38:48.960 --> 38:50.839
She's not alive, is she?

38:50.920 --> 38:52.119
Boss, this is a crime scene.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.319
A murder scene.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.919
You don't walk away from that,
pretend you never saw it.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.199
Do you want to take down
the man who did this?

38:58.280 --> 38:59.359
More than anything.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.799
All right, well then trust me!

39:00.880 --> 39:04.639
Okay? There'll be nothing we can use,
no forensics, nothing!

39:04.720 --> 39:06.919
- And he'll wriggle out of this. Again!
- John.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.559
You're a police officer.
This is a murdered woman.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.159
Her family are waiting,
going out of their minds,

39:11.240 --> 39:13.679
and you want to lock her
back up and walk away?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.839
This is about the law, not retribution.

39:16.280 --> 39:19.479
I'm not asking for your approval, son.

39:20.640 --> 39:23.279
Just your silence.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.039
I won't volunteer any information but,

39:34.360 --> 39:36.039
I won't lie for you, either.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.839
What you're doing is wrong.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.559
- Yeah, I know.
- Why do it then?

39:39.640 --> 39:41.159
'Cause it's right.

39:54.160 --> 39:56.359
Ian? I need you.

40:22.240 --> 40:24.239
Detective Sergeant Ripley.

40:25.240 --> 40:26.479
How nice to see you.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.759
No, no, no. No broken bones.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.639
Yeah, we think it was the husband.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.719
He's got some issues
he needs to work through.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.599
I'll call you back. You off?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.559
Just for a bit. I've got to.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.879
Well, is it me? Did I do something?

40:49.800 --> 40:51.879
No. I'm sorry.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.039
I'm sorry, it's just...

40:55.120 --> 40:58.119
It's John. He makes me so angry,
I don't know what to do.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.599
I've got to get out.
Just walk it off or something.

41:26.320 --> 41:27.799
He's coming your way.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.399
All right. Got it.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.119
All right.

42:50.320 --> 42:54.399
I wonder, does John Luther
ever discuss his private life with you?

42:54.480 --> 42:56.839
- No.
- Not his wife?

42:58.240 --> 43:00.479
- Her lover?
- No.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.439
You are aware of his history
of instability.

43:06.080 --> 43:09.839
I'm aware of it, yes, although
I'm not sure of its relevance.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.639
Well, it may be relevant
if it ever gives you pause

43:13.720 --> 43:15.999
to question his decisions.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.759
Um, my dad taught me to
question all judgements, sir.

43:19.160 --> 43:20.599
I do apologise.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.599
Let me rephrase, for clarity.

43:24.880 --> 43:27.359
How do you judge the quality

43:27.440 --> 43:30.639
of John Luther's
current operational decisions?

43:40.840 --> 43:42.039
Yeah.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.559
Well, it could be said that the merit
of any operational decision

43:56.640 --> 43:58.319
can only be judged on its outcome.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.559
As long as that decision was taken
within the boundaries of the law.

44:03.400 --> 44:05.359
It could be said, yes.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.479
But are you saying it?

44:07.560 --> 44:09.359
I'm just saying, it could be said.

44:09.800 --> 44:12.559
Do you know where Luther is,
right this minute?

44:12.640 --> 44:13.879
I do not, sir.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.519
Guv.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.199
- Ah. You've found him?
- Yes, sir.

44:30.360 --> 44:34.319
Ah. Detective Chief Inspector Luther.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.799
You pass, like night, from land to land.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.239
I do. I really do.

44:43.240 --> 44:45.039
There's a coffee shop not far away.

44:46.120 --> 44:47.759
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

44:48.520 --> 44:49.719
Let's.

45:03.240 --> 45:05.559
- Who's this?
- So how's it going, Lucien?

45:06.000 --> 45:07.319
I'm sorry. Who exactly is this?

45:07.400 --> 45:10.759
Listen. They've planted
evidence at the crime scene.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.879
They tried to frame me once before.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.479
They couldn't do it then
and they won't be able to do it now.

45:17.160 --> 45:20.039
All right, well, I'll be off then.

45:20.920 --> 45:23.839
- Wait!
- Look, I can make this go away.

45:24.160 --> 45:27.679
Two hundred thousand, in cash.
I know you've got it.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.959
I can't get hold of that.
Not in time. Not in cash.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.959
Well, you see, I think you can.

45:33.280 --> 45:36.119
My mate, the big one who smacked you,

45:36.520 --> 45:39.079
he's waiting on warrants as we speak.

45:39.720 --> 45:42.319
The crime scene is clear
of surveillance until then.

45:42.720 --> 45:46.319
That gives me a window of less
than an hour to make this work for you.

45:46.480 --> 45:48.919
Now if you don't want to pay for it,
that's your call.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.119
I'll give you 125, cash.

45:52.560 --> 45:53.759
That'll have to do.

45:54.120 --> 45:56.479
- Where will we meet?
- Finsbury Park Station.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.959
Platform 2, north bound, half an hour.

46:22.640 --> 46:26.079
John Luther didn't do that to you,
I'm afraid.

46:26.520 --> 46:28.319
I did.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.039
Why?

46:32.320 --> 46:35.679
Why? I couldn't help myself.

46:37.360 --> 46:38.719
I don't believe that.

46:39.960 --> 46:42.359
See, I don't think you, of all people,

46:42.440 --> 46:44.639
ever do anything
unless you decide to do it.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.959
No, it's true. I'm a bit like that.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.639
A bit random. Slightly kooky.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.199
- Kooky?
- Absolutely.

46:53.760 --> 46:56.479
Okay, Mark.
I did this because I don't like you.

46:57.600 --> 46:59.959
And because I wanted to toy with John.

47:00.840 --> 47:04.799
Ah. It's a bit like
pulling legs off flies.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.599
Why are you here, now?

47:08.320 --> 47:10.599
Because I'm sorry.

47:10.920 --> 47:12.359
- No, you're not.
- No, no, I'm not.

47:12.440 --> 47:14.359
I was just trying to empathise.

47:15.440 --> 47:19.439
I'm here because
this has gone just far enough

47:20.800 --> 47:23.919
and what I need you to do
now is pick up that phone

47:24.480 --> 47:26.519
and withdraw the complaint.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.359
And if I refuse?

47:29.400 --> 47:32.399
What if somebody actually
stood up to you and refused?

47:33.440 --> 47:36.559
Mmm. Well, then. I'd have to leave.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.079
And then one night,

47:42.720 --> 47:44.439
I'd have to come back.

47:52.040 --> 47:55.679
I'm not building a legal case
against you, John.

47:57.080 --> 47:59.159
This is about moral codes.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.599
And my standard of proof

48:03.960 --> 48:06.319
is much lower than yours.

48:07.520 --> 48:13.919
And if you breach that code in any way,
then we let you go.

48:15.240 --> 48:17.639
Quietly and without fuss.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.959
- And you'd recommend that, would you?
- Oh, it's not what I want.

48:21.280 --> 48:27.559
My recommendation will be that you are
suspended, immediately and indefinitely.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.799
And meanwhile,

48:30.280 --> 48:31.999
Kirsten Ross, hmm?

48:32.120 --> 48:34.599
Many fine officers are
working on the case.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.999
For what it's worth, I, um,

48:37.400 --> 48:39.559
wouldn't want it to
end like this for you.

48:40.200 --> 48:43.959
But there's no place in the service
for dirty coppers.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.559
No matter how well-intentioned.

48:48.960 --> 48:49.999
Schenk.

48:51.360 --> 48:52.559
When?

48:55.880 --> 48:58.359
All right. Yes, I will.

49:01.200 --> 49:02.639
Mark North put in a call

49:02.720 --> 49:05.199
to Detective Chief
Superintendent Teller.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.999
Apparently, Mr North
no longer seems to believe

49:09.080 --> 49:11.919
that the street robbers knew his name,

49:13.040 --> 49:14.599
or yours, indeed.

49:15.640 --> 49:17.079
Witness memory,

49:17.560 --> 49:18.599
funny old thing.

49:19.320 --> 49:21.599
He's withdrawn the allegation.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.479
So, uh, well, what now?

49:26.600 --> 49:28.239
You'll return to your case.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.719
Without prejudice.

49:32.000 --> 49:34.519
I didn't want to come for you, John.

49:34.960 --> 49:37.039
But they sent me to do a job.

49:38.000 --> 49:41.319
And if they send for me again,
I will come again.

49:41.400 --> 49:43.119
And I will take you down,

49:43.200 --> 49:47.759
even if it means that I won't be able
to look myself in the eye afterwards.

49:50.560 --> 49:52.639
Well, I know that feeling.

50:14.640 --> 50:15.679
Fuck!

50:38.360 --> 50:40.559
I've got you.

50:43.880 --> 50:45.199
I have got you now.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.319
Okay, that's enough of that.

50:53.200 --> 50:55.319
Lucien Burgess.

51:02.240 --> 51:04.559
Don't think I can watch any more.

51:11.840 --> 51:15.679
Did you seriously think
that you could entrap me?

51:18.840 --> 51:20.359
Not really, no.

51:21.000 --> 51:26.199
No, that blood there was
from a nice piece of steak, sirloin,

51:26.840 --> 51:29.519
I was going to have for my tea tonight

51:29.600 --> 51:32.119
in celebration of meeting you here.

51:34.480 --> 51:36.239
At the crime scene.

51:39.480 --> 51:41.639
You came of your own free will.

51:42.080 --> 51:43.799
You brought luminol.

51:43.880 --> 51:45.559
To look for blood traces.

51:46.560 --> 51:47.639
Hmm.

51:50.400 --> 51:51.879
That's not enough.

51:51.960 --> 51:53.639
Oh, I think that it is.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.799
- Do you?
- Yes.

51:56.720 --> 52:01.439
Well, DCI Luther.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.079
First you, um,

52:08.720 --> 52:10.679
you assault me.

52:12.200 --> 52:16.319
You publicly assault me!

52:17.560 --> 52:20.599
Why can't you show me some respect?

52:25.360 --> 52:27.759
Then a police officer phones me.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.879
He tells me you've
been trying to frame me.

52:32.680 --> 52:35.279
He tells me where the crime scene is.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.239
Is that your defence?

52:41.800 --> 52:44.439
Because that call, that was my mate.

52:44.520 --> 52:48.199
We set you up, Lucien,
you've been outplayed.

52:49.320 --> 52:52.319
I look forward to seeing
you prove any of that.

52:52.400 --> 52:53.759
Oh, Luther.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.039
Shall we?

53:13.280 --> 53:14.679
Turn around.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.719
Good day's work?

53:27.200 --> 53:30.799
- Goodish.
- Anyway. This is her.

53:30.880 --> 53:32.719
Alice Morgan,
meeting up with the wee girl

53:32.800 --> 53:34.359
who beat up your wife's boyfriend.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.159
Don't know whether she's
giving her money, drugs.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.439
Either way, you've got her.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.839
- Cheers.
- You take care, now.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.639
Beware of geeks bearing gifts.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.839
Justin.

54:02.800 --> 54:07.239
- Look...
- I said nothing.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.399
And I won't say anything.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.119
But you can't go on like this.

54:14.440 --> 54:15.479
You just can't.

54:27.120 --> 54:29.919
Hmm, what's this?

54:31.080 --> 54:32.559
Blackmail now?

54:33.000 --> 54:34.319
No.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.839
This thing, this weird thing between us.
It has to end.

54:40.520 --> 54:41.559
Why?

54:42.760 --> 54:44.639
It's not right, Alice.

54:46.120 --> 54:48.319
It started off,
because I was scared of you,

54:48.400 --> 54:51.359
and I thought if I could be your friend,
I could control you.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.079
And I can't control you.

54:55.320 --> 54:57.319
I'm still scared of you.

54:58.480 --> 55:00.479
I'm scared of you, too.

55:01.360 --> 55:03.279
You want to send me to prison.

55:09.560 --> 55:13.519
What you did to Mark nearly cost me.

55:14.800 --> 55:16.039
I wouldn't have let it.

55:16.120 --> 55:19.279
I know, I know you really think that.

55:19.680 --> 55:23.879
And I think, in your own way,
your intentions were good.

55:24.880 --> 55:27.839
But hurting Mark doesn't
bring Zoe back to me.

55:28.240 --> 55:31.399
That's not how people work.
That's not how they think.

55:43.280 --> 55:45.079
I'll see you soon.

56:21.680 --> 56:24.399
Zoe, are you all...

56:25.440 --> 56:26.759
What are you doing here?

56:26.840 --> 56:28.919
- Saying sorry.
- Sorry for what?

56:29.000 --> 56:30.519
For not believing you.

56:31.160 --> 56:34.359
What they said you did it's...
It's not in your nature.

56:34.440 --> 56:37.519
I should've known that of all
the people in the world...

56:37.600 --> 56:39.239
I should've known.

56:39.320 --> 56:42.199
And I should have said something.
Been there.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.719
You're obsessive, you're...

56:45.000 --> 56:46.399
Driven.

56:47.120 --> 56:49.279
God knows you're misguided.

56:49.720 --> 56:52.079
But what you never are is a liar.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.359
Not to me.

57:00.640 --> 57:02.399
Nor a coward.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.199
Oh, he's escalating fast.

57:45.880 --> 57:47.439
This man's on a murder spree.

57:51.560 --> 57:53.199
He's going to kill again, very soon.

57:59.600 --> 58:00.599
I can't see you any more.

58:02.080 --> 58:03.079
No!

58:07.800 --> 58:10.199
- He's awake.
- Who?

58:10.680 --> 58:12.119
Luther.

58:12.200 --> 58:13.199
Luther!

58:17.360 --> 58:19.559
Stay away from me!
Stay away from my life!

58:19.640 --> 58:20.759
Do you understand?
