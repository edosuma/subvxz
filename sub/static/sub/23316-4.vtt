WEBVTT

02:20.480 --> 02:22.800
Check her brothers,
everyone she knew.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.640
-How many casualties?
-Too many.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.120
Get me some coffee, please.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.560
This was taken at noon,
at the Oranit checkpoint.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.280
Amal Hussein,
the bride

02:31.440 --> 02:34.520
whom you personally hugged
before she blew herself up today.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.440
Behind her is Walid Al-Abed, whom
you remember from the hospital.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.200
We're trying to locate him.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.920
-Any intel on the third guy?
-Not yet.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.920
But Ayub is looking for info
about him at his mother's house.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.040
SILWAD VILLAGE
NORTH OF RAMALLAH

02:54.360 --> 02:56.440
[ARABIC]
[Um Taufiq, I'm sorry to bother you]

02:56.600 --> 02:59.680
[so shortly after Bashir's death,
may he rest in peace,]

02:59.960 --> 03:02.080
[but Amal has left me
no choice.]

03:04.800 --> 03:06.880
[Um Taufiq,
I'm asking of you.]

03:08.440 --> 03:10.200
[Shame on you all.]

03:10.360 --> 03:11.880
[I've had enough]

03:12.040 --> 03:13.880
[of you murderous criminals.]

03:14.160 --> 03:17.560
[Please, I came here to ask
just one small question.]

03:19.120 --> 03:22.320
[Who are these guys
sitting next to Amal?]

03:25.120 --> 03:26.880
[We don't know them.]

03:27.080 --> 03:28.720
[We've never
seen them before.]

03:32.880 --> 03:35.080
Hello, sweetie.
Is it urgent?

03:37.600 --> 03:39.640
Yes, you can sleep over
at his place.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.880
But tomorrow you're staying
home and studying for the exam.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.800
Yes, I left you some
on the countertop.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.720
There's the crispy schnitzel you like
and yellow rice.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.440
So take bus line 189 to--

03:53.960 --> 03:56.720
Sweetie, I'm busy,
we'll talk later.

03:56.880 --> 03:58.440
Bye, buddy.

04:00.120 --> 04:02.040
[Sorry, that was my son.]

04:04.160 --> 04:06.000
[Um Taufiq,
who are these guys?]

04:12.200 --> 04:14.960
[Alright. You know what?]

04:16.320 --> 04:18.960
[I dreamed that Abu Ahmad
was alive,]

04:20.080 --> 04:22.280
[sitting inside
my interrogation room,]

04:22.600 --> 04:24.960
[and I was glad he's alive.]

04:26.320 --> 04:29.760
[Because if he's alive when
everyone thinks he's dead,]

04:29.920 --> 04:32.000
[we can do as we please
with him.]

04:32.160 --> 04:34.520
[We can interrogate him
any way we like,]

04:34.680 --> 04:36.840
[keep him there
as long as we like.]

04:38.120 --> 04:41.380
[And the things we did to him
in my dream...]

04:41.540 --> 04:43.480
[May God have mercy on him.]

04:43.640 --> 04:47.040
[Even I had to look away
from time to time.]

04:47.200 --> 04:49.160
[I woke up in a cold sweat.]

04:52.240 --> 04:56.440
[And when I fell back asleep,
I had another dream.]

04:56.600 --> 05:00.760
[This time, Abu Ahmad was
in my living room.]

05:01.120 --> 05:04.520
[He came to tell me that he'd
decided to quit the resistance,]

05:05.320 --> 05:06.960
[that he'd done enough]

05:07.120 --> 05:09.360
[and that others
are continuing in his path.]

05:09.520 --> 05:12.040
[He's got a secured spot
in heaven.]

05:12.880 --> 05:15.520
[I got up, kissed him
on the head,]

05:15.680 --> 05:18.760
[and promised him we'd
arrange for him to start fresh]

05:18.920 --> 05:20.280
[wherever he chooses,]

05:20.920 --> 05:23.360
[America, Sydney, Berlin.]

05:23.520 --> 05:27.600
[I believe you and Abu Ahmad
met in Berlin, didn't you?]

05:28.520 --> 05:30.360
[You'd leave together]

05:30.520 --> 05:34.120
[with your two sweet little children,
may God keep them safe.]

05:34.280 --> 05:37.200
[They deserve to live
with their father,]

05:37.480 --> 05:40.040
[who would come home every day.]

05:41.520 --> 05:45.400
[And you'd be able to live with
your husband, without any fear.]

05:46.200 --> 05:51.080
[I'll arrange a meeting between you
and Defense Minister Gideon Avital,]

05:51.240 --> 05:53.960
[who will personally see to it
that nothing happens--]

05:54.120 --> 05:55.800
[Abu Ahmad is dead,]

05:55.960 --> 05:58.280
[just like Bashir and Amal!]

05:58.440 --> 06:01.040
[A thousand Defense Ministers
can't fix that!]

06:01.200 --> 06:03.920
[Um Taufiq, you don't need
a thousand Defense Ministers,]

06:04.080 --> 06:05.880
[you need to answer me!]

06:06.040 --> 06:08.040
[Who are the guys
in the photo?]

06:08.200 --> 06:11.300
[Maybe you know them both,
or just one of them.]

06:11.460 --> 06:14.560
[Listen to me.
Save your time and ours.]

06:14.720 --> 06:18.960
[Even if we do know them,
we'll never tell you and you know that.]

06:19.400 --> 06:23.280
[Please, I was raised never
to kick people out of my house,]

06:23.440 --> 06:24.960
[but know this:]

06:25.120 --> 06:26.880
[The minute you leave
this house,]

06:27.040 --> 06:30.000
[God will punish you
for what you're doing to us.]

06:32.680 --> 06:34.520
[May God help you all.]

07:21.200 --> 07:22.920
[Five casualties, so far.]

07:40.240 --> 07:43.360
[-Five dead, so far.]
[-Five?]

07:43.520 --> 07:44.480
[I thought I was clear:]

07:44.640 --> 07:46.740
[Amal was to leave the bag there
and get out, right?]

07:46.900 --> 07:49.760
[She had only three minutes to get out.
Perhaps she was held up--]

07:49.920 --> 07:51.880
[What good does it do me...?]

07:55.400 --> 07:56.920
[Drink up.]

08:03.160 --> 08:04.840
[Sit down.]

08:08.000 --> 08:09.960
[God, forgive me
for I have sinned.]

08:11.160 --> 08:13.160
[Listen, Walid.]

08:13.600 --> 08:17.280
[-Arrange a safe house for me.]
[-Why?]

08:17.440 --> 08:20.320
[-I want to see Nassrin.]
[-But it's too risky.]

08:20.480 --> 08:23.680
[Captain Ayub himself came to see her
today. They know you're alive.]

08:23.840 --> 08:26.800
[Did you hear what I said?
I want to see Nassrin.]

08:27.560 --> 08:29.080
[Alright.]

08:29.240 --> 08:30.080
[You're bleeding.]

08:30.240 --> 08:32.720
[It's nothing.
One of the stitches opened up.]

08:32.880 --> 08:35.640
[-You need a doctor.]
[-I need to see Nassrin.]

08:36.120 --> 08:39.600
[I'll get a doctor. If he says
it's okay, then you can leave.]

08:40.320 --> 08:42.000
[Alright.]

08:43.240 --> 08:45.000
[One more thing.]

08:47.000 --> 08:50.280
[-Get me a bottle of <i>Poison</i>.]
[-What's <i>Poison</i>?]

08:50.440 --> 08:52.000
[Her perfume.]

10:07.280 --> 10:09.040
Driver, pull over.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.560
It's all good.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.480
-Hey, pal...
-Hands off!

10:18.920 --> 10:21.800
Get your hands off me!

10:25.880 --> 10:29.120
On the floor.
Hands behind your head.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.240
What is it?

11:42.320 --> 11:44.720
I can't go on like this anymore.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.800
I plan to tell him.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.440
-When?
-Soon.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.540
-Well, are we going?
-Yeah, are you coming?

12:02.700 --> 12:04.080
Yep, just one sec.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.160
-I'll be there in a sec.
-No, Dad, we'll be late.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.880
One sec, Ido.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.000
Shoot.

12:09.160 --> 12:12.120
-It's about your new 'girlfriend'.
-Who?

12:12.280 --> 12:15.200
Dr. Shirin,
Walid Al-Abed's cousin.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.200
Oh, right. What's up?

12:17.360 --> 12:21.200
Listen up, buddy. You call her now
and ask her out on a date.

12:21.480 --> 12:23.240
Very funny, Moreno.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.000
I'd switch with you in a heartbeat,
but we need to get close to Walid.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.600
She's our only connection
to him and to Abu Ahmad.

12:29.760 --> 12:32.440
Call her now.
Meet as soon as possible

12:32.600 --> 12:35.040
and win her trust.
We have no other option.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.600
Okay, fine.

12:37.760 --> 12:39.720
-Come on, Dad.
-One second.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.160
[-Hello?]
[-Shirin?]

12:50.600 --> 12:53.200
-Who's this?
-Amir.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.640
[Oh, Amir.]

12:54.800 --> 12:56.320
[I told you I'd call.]

12:56.480 --> 12:58.040
[You did.]

12:58.240 --> 13:00.080
[Where did I catch you?]

13:00.320 --> 13:03.080
[In... in the tub.]

13:03.240 --> 13:04.480
[Really?]

13:04.640 --> 13:08.240
[-I called to ask you--]
[-Amir, wait.]

13:09.080 --> 13:11.520
[You're a really nice guy,]

13:11.680 --> 13:13.880
[but we can't see each other.]

13:14.040 --> 13:16.800
[-Why not?]
[-I don't date my patients.]

13:16.960 --> 13:18.800
[You're breaking my heart, Doc.]

13:19.000 --> 13:20.960
[If I come over,
will you fix it?]

13:21.120 --> 13:22.600
[I'm not a heart specialist,]

13:22.760 --> 13:25.480
[but I could give you the number
of an excellent cardiologist.]

13:25.640 --> 13:28.840
[-Is she as pretty as you are?]
[-She's 65 years old.]

13:29.040 --> 13:30.560
[So it's a 'no'.]

13:32.440 --> 13:34.300
Dad, are you coming?

13:34.460 --> 13:36.920
[What was that?
You have kids?]

13:37.080 --> 13:38.440
[I wish.
That was my nephew.]

13:38.600 --> 13:41.640
[Spending time with him
is the best part of the week.]

13:43.280 --> 13:46.000
[Do you really think
I'll change my mind]

13:46.160 --> 13:47.760
[because you're
good with kids?]

13:47.920 --> 13:49.720
[I do, actually.]

13:52.600 --> 13:54.120
[Well, alright.]

13:54.280 --> 13:56.640
[Although I'm sure
I'll regret it later.]

13:56.800 --> 14:00.320
[You won't.
Tomorrow at 17:00.]

14:00.480 --> 14:03.100
<i>[Cafe au Lait </i>in Ramallah.
You know the place?]

14:03.260 --> 14:04.800
[Of course.]

14:06.960 --> 14:08.400
[Then it's a date.]

14:08.680 --> 14:10.200
Gali! Gali!

14:29.480 --> 14:30.760
What?

14:32.240 --> 14:33.560
What?!

14:45.960 --> 14:48.120
What's up with you, Boaz?

14:48.280 --> 14:50.440
Are you insane?

14:50.760 --> 14:52.840
Were they hitting you?

14:53.520 --> 14:56.720
Why did you hit a cop?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.120
Moreno will take care of it.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.960
Moreno?
More like Gideon Avital.

15:05.080 --> 15:07.200
-The Defense Minister?
-In the flesh.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.120
You assaulted a cop, you moron.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.240
Let's go.

15:13.520 --> 15:14.880
What is it?

15:18.480 --> 15:21.520
-I was there, Doron.
-Where?

15:22.800 --> 15:27.560
At the pub, during the bombing.
Daria... she worked at the pub.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.520
I was at the pub,
during the terrorist attack.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.640
What about her?

15:35.040 --> 15:37.640
-What happened?
-She was blown into bits, man.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.600
What?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.760
What?

15:43.480 --> 15:47.480
-Boaz, are you alright?
-Listen, I--

15:48.520 --> 15:50.400
I don't want anyone
to know about this.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.440
Not Moreno, not the team,
not Gali.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.600
Back me up, man, I can't--
Just back me up.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.160
-Don't worry, bro. It'll be okay.
-Doron, promise me.

15:59.320 --> 16:03.040
-No one must know about this.
-You have my word.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.640
Let's get outta here.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.560
Boaz.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.880
[It's been a while
since I saw you like this.]

16:31.040 --> 16:32.600
[Mother...]

16:34.240 --> 16:36.080
[Ever since Naji died.]

16:41.400 --> 16:42.800
[Hold on.]

16:46.240 --> 16:47.680
[Hello?]

16:47.840 --> 16:49.320
[Hello, Shirin.]

16:50.960 --> 16:53.080
[Hello, cousin.
How are you?]

16:53.240 --> 16:54.320
[I'm fine.]

16:54.480 --> 16:56.560
[I wanted to thank you
for all your help.]

16:56.720 --> 17:00.480
[We'll never forget
how you've helped us.]

17:01.200 --> 17:03.000
[I did it with all my heart.]

17:03.960 --> 17:05.000
[But we--]

17:05.200 --> 17:07.760
[I need your help again.]

17:08.000 --> 17:09.240
[What is it?]

17:09.400 --> 17:11.040
[I can't say it over the phone.]

17:11.200 --> 17:13.780
[-But we must talk now.]
[-I can't.]

17:13.940 --> 17:17.520
[-Have you spoken to Abu Sharif?]
[-No, I wanted to talk to you first.]

17:17.720 --> 17:20.160
[Well, talk to him,
I have a very important meeting.]

17:20.320 --> 17:22.720
[Shirin, what could be
more important than this?]

17:22.920 --> 17:26.720
[Walid, I helped you
because you're family]

17:26.880 --> 17:28.560
[and because
I respect the patients,]

17:28.720 --> 17:31.080
[but I don't work for you.]

17:31.240 --> 17:33.360
[I didn't mean it that way.]

17:33.520 --> 17:36.160
[I know you didn't,
but that's what it sounded like.]

17:36.320 --> 17:39.520
[Talk to Dr. Abu Sharif.
I'm sorry.]

17:48.760 --> 17:50.160
You stud.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.480
Love the shirt.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.560
Quite the trend in Jenin
back in the 80's.

17:54.720 --> 17:55.440
Yep.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.600
-Wanna quickie, pretty boy?
-If you weren't my subordinate.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.760
That never stopped you before.

18:03.280 --> 18:07.720
Did you ever find out why
Boaz assaulted that cop?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.000
What's come over him?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.080
Is he fit for a mission?

18:16.760 --> 18:18.120
I see.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
Next mission, I'll send him out first.
That'll straighten him out.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.520
-He's not going on any mission.
-Why not?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.800
I'll tell you why,
but it stays between us.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.720
Absolutely.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.440
Boaz was in the attack
at <i>Saint Bernard </i>.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.920
His girlfriend worked there.
He saw her body.

18:37.600 --> 18:40.480
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

18:44.320 --> 18:48.560
He killed Bashir, so they took
revenge by killing his girlfriend.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.240
No way that's a coincidence.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.400
-He's joining the mission.
-He is not--

18:54.560 --> 18:58.240
He is too, Doron, or else his trauma
will become a post trauma.

18:58.560 --> 19:02.560
-You know how that feels, Doron.
-Moreno, please, leave him be.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.680
Tell him, and don't let
him know that I told you.

19:34.560 --> 19:38.840
[I'll have an espresso
and soda water, please. Thanks.]

20:06.160 --> 20:07.200
[Hey.]

20:15.120 --> 20:16.840
[Did I keep you waiting?]

20:17.440 --> 20:19.760
[No, just a few minutes.]

20:21.760 --> 20:23.120
[What would you
like to drink?]

20:23.280 --> 20:26.640
[-To drink? I'm starving.]
[-Excellent.]

20:27.880 --> 20:29.480
[Menu, please.]

20:37.800 --> 20:41.080
[-You don't do this often, do you?]
[-What?]

20:41.240 --> 20:42.840
[Go on dates.]

20:43.960 --> 20:46.520
[No, it's been a while.]

20:46.920 --> 20:48.960
[-Can you tell?]
[-Yep.]

20:50.000 --> 20:52.480
[Does it show on me too?]

20:52.640 --> 20:54.200
[You?]

20:55.800 --> 20:58.280
[The first time I saw you,
at the hospital,]

20:58.440 --> 21:00.240
[you were pretty.]

21:00.440 --> 21:03.200
[When I saw you outside
the swimming pool,]

21:03.360 --> 21:04.760
[you were even prettier.]

21:06.640 --> 21:10.280
[And now... May God help me,
you're so beautiful.]

21:12.760 --> 21:16.560
[You're the nicest patient with
an open-back robe I've ever had.]

21:16.720 --> 21:18.160
[Thanks.]

21:22.480 --> 21:23.640
Yes?

21:24.480 --> 21:25.720
Yes.

21:26.400 --> 21:29.000
Okay, thanks.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.640
They've intercepted
a call on Shirin's phone.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.840
Guess where Dr. Abu Sharif
is going to pay a house visit.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.760
Wanna come?

21:43.720 --> 21:47.960
You'll be in the car, serving
as unit 8200's operations officer.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.400
How are you?
Haven't seen you in a while.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
I'm fine.

21:54.760 --> 21:58.280
-What are today's specials?
-I'll get the menu.

22:00.840 --> 22:02.820
[Kudos on the French, Shirin.]

22:02.980 --> 22:06.560
[-Where did you learn French?]
[-In Paris.]

22:07.600 --> 22:10.160
[I've lived there longer
than I have here.]

22:10.320 --> 22:12.000
[Why'd you come back?]

22:13.160 --> 22:14.920
[My husband died.]

22:18.160 --> 22:19.800
[My God have mercy
on his soul.]

22:20.360 --> 22:22.000
[Thanks.]

22:23.440 --> 22:25.760
[I wanted to be
near my mother,]

22:26.160 --> 22:30.880
[then one thing led to another]

22:31.320 --> 22:32.960
[and now I'm here.]

22:37.160 --> 22:38.760
[Answer it.]

22:40.560 --> 22:42.920
[Sorry, it's my sister's husband.]

22:44.240 --> 22:45.200
[Hello?]

22:45.360 --> 22:47.640
You're with the wrong doctor.

22:48.080 --> 22:52.560
[-What do you mean?]
-Abu Sharif is on his way to the patient.

22:52.720 --> 22:55.200
[-Are you sure?]
-100%.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.120
[Give me five minutes.]

22:57.280 --> 23:00.220
Apologize nicely,
get in the car and get here stat.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.880
[I'm on my way.]

23:04.360 --> 23:06.760
[My sister Nur's rooftop
is flooded.]

23:06.920 --> 23:09.680
[I have to go help her
get stuff out of the house.]

23:09.840 --> 23:11.240
[A flooded roof
in the summer?]

23:11.400 --> 23:12.880
[It really is odd.]

23:13.040 --> 23:16.320
[Perhaps the water heater exploded,
he didn't explain.]

23:16.840 --> 23:19.240
[-Are you serious?]
[-I'll make it up to you.]

23:32.520 --> 23:36.340
I need to hear from Steve that
I'm excluded from the mission?

23:36.500 --> 23:38.120
Boaz, calm down.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.040
You don't have the balls
to tell me yourself?

23:44.040 --> 23:46.120
Has Doron spoken to you?

23:46.880 --> 23:50.680
-It has nothing to do with Doron.
-What did he tell you?

23:54.880 --> 23:56.960
You're sending Nurit instead.

23:57.800 --> 24:01.240
I see you've made her your personal
counter-terrorist operative.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.760
Boaz, you beat up a cop yesterday,

24:04.920 --> 24:07.120
and today you can't
control your mouth.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.520
Do I really need Doron
to decide to exclude you?

24:12.560 --> 24:14.200
-Boaz...
-Don't.

24:16.280 --> 24:17.360
Boaz.

24:19.920 --> 24:22.120
I need to be there
when they catch him!

24:22.560 --> 24:25.960
Hey, hey!
Listen to me.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.000
Go rest.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.400
[My darling.]

26:19.000 --> 26:20.680
[Don't cry.]

26:54.280 --> 26:56.520
[Bashir is dead, Abu Ahmad.]

26:57.440 --> 27:00.040
[-And Amal...]
[-May God have mercy on them.]

27:00.880 --> 27:02.840
[How are the children?
How's my mother?]

27:03.000 --> 27:05.440
[The children are fine,
thank God.]

27:05.600 --> 27:08.080
[But this whole situation
is tough on them.]

27:09.760 --> 27:11.720
[And how are you?]

27:13.920 --> 27:15.880
[I want you beside me.]

27:16.880 --> 27:18.640
[I've missed you.]

27:19.480 --> 27:21.760
[I can't live without you.]

27:22.240 --> 27:24.960
[Taufiq, how much longer
will we live this way?]

27:27.280 --> 27:29.160
[Until we win.]

27:29.440 --> 27:31.480
[You promised me.]

27:32.040 --> 27:34.920
[I can't go on like this.
I've had it.]

27:36.000 --> 27:37.960
[We need to live together
as a family.]

27:38.120 --> 27:40.600
[Our children deserve a good life,
outside of this hell.]

27:40.760 --> 27:42.720
[There there, my love.]

27:42.880 --> 27:44.600
[Be patient.]

27:51.480 --> 27:53.280
[Here's a birthday present
for you.]

27:53.720 --> 27:55.280
<i>[Poison.]</i>

27:55.640 --> 27:57.240
<i>[Poison?]</i>

27:57.600 --> 28:01.200
[-I've stopped wearing it ages ago.]
[-Really?]

28:02.480 --> 28:05.400
[You'd wear it all the time
when we met.]

28:05.760 --> 28:08.760
[Poor Walid looked
all over Ramallah for it.]

28:09.720 --> 28:11.440
[It's alright.]

28:12.840 --> 28:16.360
[I'll wear it on my date
next Friday.]

28:16.520 --> 28:18.280
[You have a date?]

28:18.440 --> 28:20.160
[I'll show you 'date'!]

28:40.600 --> 28:45.200
-Doron, why isn't Boaz joining us?
-Moreno told him to rest.

28:45.440 --> 28:48.160
To rest?
Fucking bastard.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.400
He rests while we grind ourselves?
What is he tired of?

28:50.560 --> 28:53.720
Of hearing you talk, bro.
Quit yapping.

28:56.240 --> 28:58.800
-Are you alright?
-Yeah, why?

29:02.680 --> 29:05.720
What a cute kid.

29:06.160 --> 29:10.560
-He's your eldest, right?
-My firstborn, Guy.

29:10.760 --> 29:14.000
-Nurit, wanna see mine, sweetie?
-Your what?

29:14.160 --> 29:17.000
I have a photo of him
on my iPhone going number two.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.120
Wanna see him take a bath?

29:19.280 --> 29:21.880
Just ignore him. It'll fade out,
like background noise.

29:22.040 --> 29:25.240
Watch it, Avihai,
or I'll have you faded out.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.500
See that?
He's getting cheeky.

29:28.660 --> 29:32.760
Amir, according to the drone,
the doctor's headed to Al-Tira, Ramallah.

29:32.920 --> 29:35.960
I'm coordinating the arrival of aid
and search &amp; rescue forces.

29:36.120 --> 29:40.240
I'll have the exact coordinates
later on. Good luck, guys.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.680
Naor, get the rifles out.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.240
[The doctor is here.]

30:12.520 --> 30:14.080
[The doctor needs to see you.]

30:28.400 --> 30:29.840
[Not like that.]

30:45.240 --> 30:48.320
[-Peace be upon you.]
[-Hello, my friend.]

30:48.480 --> 30:50.360
[Are you from Jerusalem?]

30:50.520 --> 30:51.800
[Why, did you think
I'm from Jenin?]

30:51.960 --> 30:54.080
[No, but this is part of Beitunia.]

30:54.240 --> 30:55.120
[-Is it?]
[-Yes.]

30:56.200 --> 30:58.000
[You got connections
in the electric company?]

30:58.160 --> 31:01.360
[No, but my uncle Nidal, Abu Amar,
works in Jerusalem. Know him?]

31:01.520 --> 31:04.200
[Sure. Sure I do.
Nidal is your uncle?]

31:04.360 --> 31:06.320
[-Yes, he is.]
[-You don't say.]

31:08.200 --> 31:11.680
-We've been exposed!
-Son of a bitch!

31:17.960 --> 31:20.000
[They found us!
Let's go!]

31:33.960 --> 31:35.600
[Get in!]

31:45.200 --> 31:46.440
[Go ahead!]

32:06.440 --> 32:07.800
[Where is he?]

32:08.680 --> 32:09.920
[Don't move.]

32:10.080 --> 32:11.360
[Don't move!]

32:23.640 --> 32:24.680
[-Where is he?]
[-I don't know.]

32:24.840 --> 32:27.120
[-Liar! Where is he hiding?]
[-I told you, I don't know.]

32:27.280 --> 32:28.800
[-Where is he?]
[-I don't know.]

32:28.960 --> 32:32.200
Doron, they're closing in on me,
send rescue, stat!

32:32.520 --> 32:34.160
[-Where is he?]
[-I swear I don't know.]

32:34.320 --> 32:35.800
[-Talk!]
[-Enough!]

32:35.960 --> 32:37.040
[Talk!]

32:37.200 --> 32:39.320
[-Where is he?]
[-Enough!]

32:39.480 --> 32:41.520
[Listen carefully,
Dr. Abu Sharif,]

32:41.680 --> 32:43.160
[don't act surprised!]

32:43.320 --> 32:45.440
[We know where you're from,
what you've done,]

32:45.600 --> 32:47.600
[and where your
entire family lives.]

32:47.760 --> 32:51.480
[If you cherish your family, talk,
or we pay them a visit tonight!]

32:51.640 --> 32:53.480
They're closing in on me,
you hear me?!

32:53.640 --> 32:56.360
[I didn't see him, I got here right
before you. He wasn't here yet.]

32:56.520 --> 32:59.400
Doron, pull out right now. Steve is
surrounded, the unit is on its way.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.720
[Enough,
they're on to us.]

33:02.480 --> 33:03.880
[Come on.]

33:18.680 --> 33:21.360
This episode is dedicated to Iris Azulai
of blessed memory
