00:33.634 --> 00:36.302
    (thunder rumbling)          

00:44.044 --> 00:46.946
    (seabirds crying)           

00:55.456 --> 00:58.157
  (siren wailing in distance)   

01:18.278 --> 01:21.747
     (garbled police radio      
         transmission)          

01:21.782 --> 01:24.350
             Yo, over here.     

01:26.320 --> 01:27.987
        (laughing)              

01:50.410 --> 01:51.711
        (car horn honks)        

01:51.745 --> 01:54.547
    (instinct chatter)          

01:56.683 --> 02:01.053
  (garbled radio transmission)  

02:01.088 --> 02:02.822
        (laughing)              

02:12.366 --> 02:14.100
MAN:                            
You can catch it                
at the corner.                  

02:14.134 --> 02:15.401
WOMAN:                          
Oh, there. Thanks.              

02:54.074 --> 02:56.209
 (tires squealing in distance)  

03:01.281 --> 03:04.283
 (keyless entry remote chirps)  

03:07.754 --> 03:08.888
        (gunshot)               

03:23.837 --> 03:26.572
        (siren wailing)         

03:42.789 --> 03:44.357
    Is the clerk going          
      to be okay, Luthor?       

03:44.391 --> 03:45.791
                    He's beat up
            pretty bad, Rose.   

03:45.826 --> 03:47.159
Did he resist?                  

03:47.194 --> 03:48.561
             No sign of it.     

03:48.595 --> 03:49.829
            (sighs)             

03:51.898 --> 03:54.400
We need more people.            

03:56.436 --> 03:58.337
      (car doors closing)       

03:58.372 --> 03:59.572
    Have you seen him?          

03:59.606 --> 04:01.340
                  No.           

04:01.375 --> 04:03.209
                  You?          

04:03.243 --> 04:06.145
              No.               

04:06.179 --> 04:10.650
    He's not a guy who should   
      spend a lot of time alone.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.257
      (crickets chirping)       

04:51.825 --> 04:53.559
        (knock at door)         

04:56.096 --> 04:57.730
    You look terrible.          

04:57.764 --> 04:59.899
        Thank you.              

05:01.435 --> 05:04.136
          Are you, uh, expecting
                someone else?   

05:04.171 --> 05:06.138
        Old habit.              

05:06.173 --> 05:07.807
            I was on my way home

05:07.841 --> 05:10.976
from work-- thought I'd stop by,
     see how you're doing.      

05:13.513 --> 05:15.715
      So how're you doing?      

05:15.749 --> 05:18.651
 Actually, I'm enjoying myself. 

05:18.685 --> 05:20.052
         (door closes)          
Okay.                           

05:21.421 --> 05:22.855
    You want a drink?           

05:22.889 --> 05:24.223
            I can't.            

05:24.257 --> 05:25.791
            Not yet.            

05:25.826 --> 05:27.626
     You want another one?      

05:27.661 --> 05:29.729
            Not yet.            

05:29.763 --> 05:33.366
     You're supposed to be      
    on medical leave.           

05:33.400 --> 05:34.900
Actually, I am on medical leave.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.136
    I'm just taking it          
         at the office.         

05:37.170 --> 05:40.172
     Do you have a murder?      

05:40.207 --> 05:42.875
No. I got two murders.          

05:42.909 --> 05:44.477
    You think there's a pattern?

05:44.511 --> 05:45.978
I think it might be time        

05:46.012 --> 05:47.947
to hire a temporary consultant. 

05:47.981 --> 05:50.316
              What's wrong      
        with your people?       

05:50.350 --> 05:51.650
Nothing.                        

05:51.685 --> 05:52.885
They're young.                  

05:52.919 --> 05:54.453
They're ambitious.              

05:54.488 --> 05:56.055
They all have                   
multiple degrees.               

05:56.089 --> 05:58.491
Ten years' time,                

05:58.525 --> 06:00.359
they'll develop some instincts. 

06:00.394 --> 06:01.927
  I won't have 'em that long.   

06:01.962 --> 06:03.829
        They're working         
    on their résumés.           

06:03.864 --> 06:05.297
        I'm on vacation.        

06:05.332 --> 06:06.899
    You're on a suspension.     

06:06.933 --> 06:08.701
          Same thing.           

06:08.735 --> 06:11.437
     I need your intuition.     

06:11.471 --> 06:13.539
        You got anything        
         better to do?          

06:13.573 --> 06:15.574
                  (sighs)       

06:15.609 --> 06:18.711
        (phone ringing)         

06:21.882 --> 06:24.850
      (ringing continues)       

06:24.885 --> 06:26.986
                 (exhales)      

06:29.456 --> 06:31.891
Okay, you think about it.       

06:31.925 --> 06:34.093
I'll let myself out.            

06:34.127 --> 06:38.798
      (ringing continues)       

06:42.035 --> 06:43.869
          Hello, Jen.           

06:43.904 --> 06:45.571
  How did you know it was me?   

06:45.605 --> 06:47.339
                Coply intuition.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.741
     Am I calling too late?     

06:48.775 --> 06:50.676
         It's 5:00 in L.A., Jen.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.745
        I need to talk.         

06:52.779 --> 06:53.846
             Okay.              

06:53.880 --> 06:55.681
         I'm confused.          

06:55.715 --> 06:57.483
 I still care about you, Jesse. 

06:57.517 --> 06:58.951
You're living with Elliot,      
          aren't you?           

06:58.985 --> 07:01.120
              Yes.              
 Doesn't sound confused to me.  

07:01.154 --> 07:02.288
         You drinking?          

07:02.322 --> 07:03.389
        Somewhat.               

07:03.423 --> 07:04.757
    Talk to me, Jesse.          

07:04.791 --> 07:06.926
I talk to you all the time, Jen.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.327
        You had a fight.        

07:08.361 --> 07:10.429
              Yes.              
  And Elliot walked out again.  

07:10.464 --> 07:12.565
              Yes.              
  And you still care about me.  

07:12.599 --> 07:13.599
              Yes.              

07:13.633 --> 07:15.000
 I don't think we should talk.  

07:15.035 --> 07:17.169
You don't think we should       
         talk tonight?          

07:19.506 --> 07:21.640
         I don't think          
     we should talk at all.     

07:21.675 --> 07:24.944
         For how long?          
      As long as it takes.      

07:28.982 --> 07:31.083
(handset clanging loudly)       

07:38.558 --> 07:41.727
(soft piano music playing)      
            (sighs)             

07:47.400 --> 07:49.768
    What are you looking at?    

08:06.286 --> 08:08.454
            (sighs)             

08:17.030 --> 08:21.534
        (phone ringing)         

08:27.641 --> 08:30.142
      (ringing continues)       

08:40.386 --> 08:43.389
 (phonograph needle scratching) 

08:52.465 --> 08:53.766
         I called you.          

08:53.800 --> 08:56.201
        When?                   

08:56.236 --> 08:58.537
              Lots. Your phone's
                out of order.   

08:58.572 --> 09:00.306
    Oh, my God.                 

09:00.340 --> 09:02.341
You're not supposed             
to talk to me.                  

09:02.375 --> 09:04.109
                This is my time.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.713
So how's our                    
acting police chief?            

09:07.747 --> 09:09.148
        He's fine.              

09:09.182 --> 09:11.050
I didn't ask you                
how he was feeling.             

09:11.084 --> 09:12.484
I asked you how                 
he was doing.                   

09:12.519 --> 09:15.154
        He's fine.              

09:15.188 --> 09:17.256
    What do you think?          

09:17.290 --> 09:20.092
    Well, if they'd given me the
job, I'd be way over my head.   

09:20.126 --> 09:21.126
So?                             

09:21.161 --> 09:22.561
         He's way over his head.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.564
Well, he's got a good attitude. 

09:25.599 --> 09:26.832
                  And one course

09:26.866 --> 09:28.133
in criminal investigation,      

09:28.168 --> 09:29.835
    which is one more           
          than I have.          

09:29.869 --> 09:32.605
I'm surprised what's his name   
didn't hire his son-in-law.     

09:32.639 --> 09:34.873
             It's Carter Hanson.
         And I'm surprised, too.

09:34.908 --> 09:38.377
    So what about this          
convenience store robbery?      

09:38.411 --> 09:39.912
            What about it?      

09:39.946 --> 09:41.313
    You sound like me.          

09:41.348 --> 09:45.017
 Final Stop clerk's in a coma.  

09:45.051 --> 09:47.019
     Luthor's hoping a clue     
          will pop up.          

09:47.053 --> 09:49.021
It doesn't always               
happen that way, Rose.          

09:49.055 --> 09:50.456
          I know that.          

09:50.490 --> 09:51.824
         You need to be         
     in the field with him.     

09:51.858 --> 09:53.058
    We wouldn't have anyone     
     to answer the phones.      

09:53.093 --> 09:55.194
Well, hire a temp.              
      Town Council won't let us.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.463
     (seabird screeching,       
      bell buoy clanging)       

09:57.497 --> 10:00.432
 You know, I've got some juice  
    with the phone company.     

10:00.467 --> 10:01.934
     We could get them out here.

10:01.968 --> 10:03.235
        Don't.                  

10:09.576 --> 10:11.210
        I need help.            

10:11.244 --> 10:14.947
  Is there something you want   
  to talk to me about, Jesse?   

10:14.981 --> 10:17.483
        Yes.                    

10:19.786 --> 10:22.521
     I bought a cell phone      
         this morning,          

10:22.555 --> 10:24.623
        and I don't know        
    how to program it.          

10:24.658 --> 10:27.493
 I thought you didn't like them.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.094
            I don't.            

10:29.129 --> 10:32.765
      Well, I'll help you       
 if you'll give me the number.  

10:32.799 --> 10:34.299
I can't give you the number.    

10:34.334 --> 10:35.367
        Why can't you give me   
                  the number?   

10:35.402 --> 10:36.335
'Cause I don't like             

10:36.369 --> 10:37.269
receiving phone calls.          

10:37.303 --> 10:38.804
            Then why did you get

10:38.838 --> 10:40.639
                a cell phone?   

10:42.642 --> 10:43.976
            (sighs)             

10:46.279 --> 10:48.380
     Do you like me, Jesse?     

10:51.351 --> 10:53.052
            Yes.                

10:53.086 --> 10:54.953
Do you like talking to me,      
             Jesse?             

10:54.988 --> 10:57.890
            Yes.                

11:04.230 --> 11:07.032
I don't want anyone else        
to know the number.             

11:07.067 --> 11:09.268
The first victim was            
a 23-year-old male;             

11:09.302 --> 11:11.804
seventh floor                   
of a parking garage;            

11:11.838 --> 11:13.972
one shot to the head            
behind the ear.                 

11:14.007 --> 11:15.040
                    .22.        

11:15.075 --> 11:16.775
Yeah, no shell casing.          

11:16.810 --> 11:18.744
So, probably                    
used a revolver.                

11:18.778 --> 11:20.612
No sign of a struggle.          

11:20.647 --> 11:22.915
So, either                      
he knew the killer              

11:22.949 --> 11:24.483
or he didn't                    
see it coming.                  

11:24.517 --> 11:25.918
                    Or both.    

11:25.952 --> 11:28.187
            Parked up top, so he
          came during rush hour.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.622
            Stayed late. When   
             he went to his car,

11:30.657 --> 11:32.057
    the seventh floor           
      was pretty deserted.      

11:32.092 --> 11:34.226
    You know all this.          
    What do you need me for?    

11:34.260 --> 11:35.794
          I told you.           

11:37.130 --> 11:39.331
             My coply intuition.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.566
  Nobody even heard the shot.   

11:40.600 --> 11:43.135
         Street noise.          
 It's a happening part of town. 

11:43.169 --> 11:45.270
          Surveillance camera?  

11:45.305 --> 11:46.405
One in the stairwell.           

11:46.439 --> 11:49.341
Young guy,                      
looked pretty fit.              

11:49.375 --> 11:51.710
     What time did he exit      
         the stairwell?         

11:51.745 --> 11:52.811
Five after 10:00.               

11:52.846 --> 11:55.214
            What else you see   
                    on the tape?

11:55.248 --> 11:57.549
     Well, nobody for about     
      a half hour before,       

11:57.584 --> 12:00.986
    and then three-quarters     
    of an hour later,           

12:01.020 --> 12:03.455
the, uh, the woman              
who found the body.             

12:03.490 --> 12:05.958
            "10:05."            

12:05.992 --> 12:10.062
        Well, the shooter was   
          either waiting for him

12:10.096 --> 12:11.330
         or he just drove around

12:11.364 --> 12:13.365
        till he found a nice,   
    quiet spot for a killing.   

12:13.399 --> 12:15.601
      .22 behind the ear.       
          Mob-related?          

12:15.635 --> 12:18.704
         Well, it seems         
 like a reasonable assumption.  

12:18.772 --> 12:20.439
Kid was a wannabe,              

12:20.473 --> 12:21.840
    freelance mostly.           

12:21.875 --> 12:23.242
      Who did he work for?      

12:23.276 --> 12:24.376
Bixy Chappelle.                 

12:24.410 --> 12:25.444
         Late Leo Finn.         

12:25.478 --> 12:27.780
     Presently, Gino Fish.      

12:27.814 --> 12:29.515
Nothing serious.                

12:29.549 --> 12:31.850
You know, mostly                
he just went for coffee.        

12:31.885 --> 12:33.619
However, the mob theory         

12:33.653 --> 12:35.087
    is no longer operative.     

12:35.121 --> 12:37.656
            Because?            

12:37.690 --> 12:39.858
Second victim:                  

12:39.893 --> 12:43.128
38-year-old black female,       
        mother of three.        

12:43.163 --> 12:44.563
             Nice.              

12:44.597 --> 12:45.531
Same M.O.:                      

12:45.565 --> 12:48.133
parking garage,                 
one shot behind the ear.        

12:48.168 --> 12:50.169
     The press doesn't know     
          this stuff.           

12:50.203 --> 12:52.638
    Not hardly.                 

12:52.672 --> 12:54.740
     There's gonna be more.     
        Do I get a car?         

12:54.774 --> 12:59.144
Jesse, I thought you knew       
how to get a car by now.        

12:59.179 --> 13:01.013
You know,                       
when I was in                   

13:01.047 --> 13:04.049
         the hospital,          
somebody signed a car out       

13:04.083 --> 13:05.951
    of the motor pool           
         under my name.         

13:05.985 --> 13:07.886
You wouldn't know anything      
          about that,           

13:07.921 --> 13:09.788
would you?                      
                About what?     

13:11.291 --> 13:13.826
Temporary consultants           
don't get cars.                 

13:13.860 --> 13:15.994
    Jesse,                      

13:16.029 --> 13:18.697
find anything,                  
give it to me.                  

13:18.731 --> 13:20.933
You're not deputized.           
You're a consultant.            

13:20.967 --> 13:23.202
     Temporary consultant.      

13:23.236 --> 13:25.671
    I don't want anyone else    
          to have it.           

13:48.361 --> 13:52.431
 (intermittent whooshing sound) 

13:58.438 --> 14:01.673
(whooshing turns into gunshots) 

14:01.708 --> 14:03.575
                    Same gun?   
         Same caliber.          

14:03.610 --> 14:06.578
            When will we know   
                if it's a match?

14:06.613 --> 14:07.946
  Why couldn't I bring Reggie?  

14:07.981 --> 14:11.183
    I wanted to talk to you     
        about him.              

14:11.217 --> 14:13.252
You wanted to talk              
to me about a dog?              

14:13.286 --> 14:14.686
              I thought it would
                     be awkward.

14:14.721 --> 14:15.721
He's a dog.                     

14:15.755 --> 14:18.190
Awkward for you.                

14:18.224 --> 14:21.460
You never show                  
your dog any affection.         

14:21.494 --> 14:22.694
        He's not my dog.        

14:22.729 --> 14:24.329
      Looks like your dog.      

14:24.364 --> 14:25.964
                He witnessed his
                 owner's murder.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.065
He's just staying with me       

14:27.100 --> 14:28.567
till I can find him a new home. 

14:28.601 --> 14:30.435
How long has he been there?     

14:30.470 --> 14:32.704
    Three-and-a-half years.     

14:36.709 --> 14:40.712
      Well, he never seems      
          to want any.          

14:40.780 --> 14:42.781
Besides, he's a pain in the ass.

14:42.815 --> 14:45.784
      I'll pour a scotch,       
    and I can just feel him,    

14:45.818 --> 14:48.387
        so I look,              
and he's staring at me...       

14:50.423 --> 14:53.058
  ...like he's my conscience.   

14:53.092 --> 14:54.927
    Then I find myself          
        talking to him.         

14:54.961 --> 14:56.061
        What do you say?        

14:56.095 --> 14:57.095
            The kind of thing   

14:57.130 --> 14:59.398
you'd say to a roommate--       
            a guy--             

14:59.432 --> 15:01.166
like, "What are you looking at?"
            It's...             

15:01.200 --> 15:03.402
  You had a dog before, Jesse.  

15:03.436 --> 15:04.870
            Boomer.             

15:04.904 --> 15:06.772
And where did                   
Boomer sleep?                   

15:06.806 --> 15:08.106
        On my bed.              

15:08.141 --> 15:09.341
Where does Reggie sleep?        

15:09.375 --> 15:11.543
        On his dog bed.         

15:11.577 --> 15:13.312
What happened                   
to Boomer?                      

15:13.346 --> 15:15.380
            He died.            

15:15.415 --> 15:17.916
Do you care about Reggie?       

15:22.855 --> 15:25.190
        Yes, I do.              

15:28.861 --> 15:32.064
         Don't say it.          

15:32.098 --> 15:32.998
        Say what?               

15:33.032 --> 15:34.866
        My wife left me,        

15:34.901 --> 15:37.369
        and my dog died         
      about the same time,      

15:37.403 --> 15:39.571
and I have a fear of loss.      

15:39.639 --> 15:42.074
        I didn't say it.        

15:45.144 --> 15:46.645
What did Healy really want?     

15:46.679 --> 15:48.180
             I already told you.

15:48.214 --> 15:50.716
What did he say                 
when he came to your house?     

15:50.750 --> 15:53.785
 He said that he wanted to see  
        how I was doing.        

15:53.820 --> 15:54.920
     That's a load of crap.     

15:54.954 --> 15:56.521
    He's got a serial killer    
         on his hands.          

15:56.556 --> 15:59.658
    He's also got a temporary   
colostomy and a lot of rehab.   

15:59.692 --> 16:00.926
    He shouldn't be working.    

16:00.960 --> 16:02.995
 A cop gets shot, he's entitled 
    to some time off.           

16:03.029 --> 16:05.630
        You think               
  there's a definite pattern?   

16:05.665 --> 16:07.666
        (sighs heavily)         

16:07.700 --> 16:10.635
    Well, we talk every day.    

16:10.670 --> 16:11.803
         You and Healy?         

16:11.838 --> 16:15.073
     No, not me and Healy.      

16:15.108 --> 16:17.376
I'm paying you $180 bucks       
        an hour, right?         

16:17.410 --> 16:19.144
    Correct.                    
        Well, I was wondering   

16:19.178 --> 16:21.113
     when we could get back     
    to the reason I called.     

16:21.147 --> 16:21.980
    Your wife.                  

16:22.015 --> 16:24.249
            Ex-wife.            

16:24.283 --> 16:25.984
I'm not talking to Jen anymore. 

16:26.019 --> 16:28.420
You're not talking to Jen       
         anymore <i>today.</i>         

16:28.454 --> 16:30.288
     I'm not talking to Jen     
    anymore-- period.           

16:30.323 --> 16:31.923
Did you talk to Jen last night? 

16:31.958 --> 16:32.991
              Yes.              

16:33.026 --> 16:34.259
     But you're not talking     
        to her anymore.         

16:34.293 --> 16:35.360
        That's correct.         

16:35.395 --> 16:36.161
     What if she calls you?     

16:36.195 --> 16:37.262
        She can't.              

16:37.296 --> 16:39.331
      You mean she won't.       

16:39.365 --> 16:40.899
     No, I mean she can't.      

16:40.933 --> 16:41.967
            Why not?            

16:42.001 --> 16:45.303
    I had a seminal moment.     

16:54.047 --> 16:56.348
 (seabirds crying in distance)  

17:05.223 --> 17:06.425
              Don't turn around.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.060
    Nobody's watching.          

17:08.094 --> 17:09.294
                  They could be.
                     Small town.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.063
                 I'm not allowed
                 to talk to you.

17:11.097 --> 17:14.465
      Maybe we just bumped      
  into each other; small town.  

17:14.500 --> 17:16.501
    Still not supposed          
        to talk to you.         

17:16.536 --> 17:18.936
For the record,                 
I called <i>you,</i> Suit.             

17:18.971 --> 17:20.739
        Phone's out of order.   

17:20.772 --> 17:23.108
How do you know                 
my phone's out order?           

17:23.142 --> 17:24.209
        Information's out there.

17:24.242 --> 17:27.012
              All you have to do
                is let it in.   

17:39.659 --> 17:41.693
      You didn't come here      
to give me doughnuts, Lou.      

17:41.727 --> 17:43.328
I'm Jesse.                      

17:43.362 --> 17:45.097
             Of course, you are.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.465
So how you doing, Chief?        

17:46.499 --> 17:48.500
    I'm not the chief.          

17:51.771 --> 17:52.737
         Sure, you are.         

17:52.772 --> 17:54.172
             I'm the temp chief.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.741
You introduce yourself          
as Temp Chief?                  

17:56.776 --> 17:58.743
                    No.         

17:58.778 --> 18:00.712
Well, there you go.             

18:00.746 --> 18:03.882
So how are you doing with this  
convenience store thing?        

18:03.916 --> 18:06.885
            I can't tell you.   

18:06.919 --> 18:09.121
Paradise is close               
to the main highway.            

18:09.155 --> 18:10.288
Access both in and out.         

18:10.323 --> 18:12.424
                    I know that.

18:12.458 --> 18:13.458
Easy mark for a pro.            

18:13.493 --> 18:17.028
                 I got a feeling
                 it's a non-pro.

18:17.063 --> 18:18.330
    You got a feeling?          

18:18.364 --> 18:20.599
         Could have been a local
            with a drug problem.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.834
Could have been.                

18:22.869 --> 18:24.769
Either way, those kind          
of robberies are almost         

18:24.804 --> 18:26.037
impossible to prevent           

18:26.072 --> 18:27.906
and just as impossible          
to solve.                       

18:27.940 --> 18:31.343
                    I know that.

18:33.012 --> 18:34.412
                 The clerk died.

18:37.150 --> 18:38.917
You need more people.           

18:38.951 --> 18:41.086
    (wings fluttering)          

18:41.120 --> 18:44.422
          Town Council won't let
            me hire anyone else.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.725
            Because?            

18:46.759 --> 18:49.761
My sense is, they're planning   
        on bringing you back.   

18:49.795 --> 18:52.464
    I don't think so.           

18:52.498 --> 18:55.700
          Something will pop up.

18:55.735 --> 18:59.137
Doesn't always happen           
that way, Suit.                 

19:01.274 --> 19:02.908
         Just in case.          

19:02.942 --> 19:05.577
That's just between             
you and me.                     

19:06.479 --> 19:08.613
    (seabirds crying)           

19:09.815 --> 19:11.950
    (birds twittering)          

19:16.489 --> 19:19.224
    (phone flips open,          
      speed dialing tone)       

19:19.258 --> 19:21.293
      (phone line ringing)      

19:21.327 --> 19:22.794
         (phone rings)          

19:22.828 --> 19:24.296
  Paradise Police Department,   
        Officer Gammon.         

19:24.330 --> 19:26.064
     Is this thing working?     

19:26.098 --> 19:28.433
          Yes, Jesse,           
I can hear you perfectly.       

19:30.236 --> 19:32.671
Rose, did you get               

19:32.705 --> 19:34.839
 the computer-enhanced pictures 
        of the robbery?         

19:34.874 --> 19:37.609
        Oh, yes, I did.         

19:39.512 --> 19:40.545
          Who called?           

19:40.580 --> 19:43.148
                My mom.         

19:43.182 --> 19:45.283
(indistinct chatter)            

19:46.285 --> 19:48.320
    Afternoon, Chief Stone.     

19:48.354 --> 19:50.455
        Afternoon, Elizabeth.   

19:50.489 --> 19:53.091
    (tires squealing)           

19:53.125 --> 19:55.193
        (brakes screech)        

19:57.730 --> 20:00.232
    You're on the wrong side    
         of the street.         

20:00.266 --> 20:02.934
Well, you're not on duty,       
        are you, Jesse?         

20:02.969 --> 20:05.003
      No, I'm not, Sissy.       

20:05.037 --> 20:06.638
      Where're you headed?      

20:06.672 --> 20:09.474
             Home.              

20:09.508 --> 20:11.543
  Hop in. I'm going that way.   

20:14.113 --> 20:15.981
    (tires squealing)           

20:25.157 --> 20:26.658
          I forgot something.   

20:26.692 --> 20:28.293
         You won't mind waiting.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.865
    It's hot in here.           

20:33.899 --> 20:36.067
             It is.             

20:36.102 --> 20:37.702
    How's your place, Jesse?    

20:37.737 --> 20:39.504
            Remote.             

20:39.538 --> 20:41.706
    Sorry. We did have          
    financial issues.           

20:41.741 --> 20:43.308
         Remote's good.         

20:43.342 --> 20:45.277
 I don't have your cell number. 

20:45.311 --> 20:46.745
    I don't have one.           

20:46.779 --> 20:49.180
        Sit down, Jesse.        

20:49.215 --> 20:51.383
                      This might
                take a while.   

20:57.189 --> 20:59.758
        I was wondering if you'd
            considered my offer.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.394
 And what offer would that be?  

21:02.428 --> 21:03.461
                We were dancing,

21:03.496 --> 21:04.863
and you said you liked my dress.

21:04.897 --> 21:06.598
             I said             
 I wasn't wearing any underwear 

21:06.632 --> 21:09.367
  and then I suggested we have  
  some nice, uncomplicated sex  

21:09.402 --> 21:11.369
     with nothing at stake.     

21:11.404 --> 21:14.773
      And what did I say?       

21:14.807 --> 21:15.874
    I think you said, "Wow."    

21:15.908 --> 21:17.342
        At which point,         
    your girlfriend cut in.     

21:17.376 --> 21:18.410
    What was her name?          

21:18.444 --> 21:20.445
             Abby.              

21:20.479 --> 21:22.547
That was a long time ago, Sissy.

21:22.581 --> 21:24.482
I didn't ask when; I asked      
    if you'd considered it.     

21:24.517 --> 21:41.766
             Often.             

21:43.703 --> 21:46.237
    The offer stands.           

21:47.173 --> 21:50.241
Sounds like a contract.         

21:53.112 --> 21:54.646
  When we run into each other,  

21:54.680 --> 21:58.350
        it's never spoken of,   
    but it's there, you know.   

21:58.384 --> 22:00.685
        Are you wearing         
    any underwear now?          

22:00.720 --> 22:02.754
    What do you think?          

22:02.788 --> 22:06.358
         I wasn't sure.         

22:08.661 --> 22:10.462
            I can't.            

22:10.496 --> 22:12.397
      I know you want me.       

22:12.431 --> 22:14.666
     Of course I want you.      
         I'm not dead.          

22:14.700 --> 22:16.301
        You're involved         
     with a friend of mine.     

22:16.335 --> 22:17.736
                     Hasty and I
                    are divorced

22:17.770 --> 22:19.270
    as you well know.           

22:19.305 --> 22:21.740
Convict's wife was not something
  that fit well on my résumé.   

22:21.774 --> 22:23.742
  I'm talking about Suitcase.   

22:23.776 --> 22:25.043
        Suitcase?               

22:25.077 --> 22:26.911
            Luthor.             

22:26.946 --> 22:28.346
        Luthor and I are        
    just good friends.          

22:28.381 --> 22:29.347
He's interested in my business. 

22:29.382 --> 22:32.917
        I'm sure he is.         

22:32.952 --> 22:34.919
    What'd you forget?          

22:34.954 --> 22:36.187
        Excuse me?              

22:36.222 --> 22:38.723
 You said you forgot something. 
    What'd you forget?          

22:40.025 --> 22:42.660
        I forget.               

22:44.563 --> 22:47.599
     Think I'll walk home.      

22:50.669 --> 22:51.970
             Jesse.             

22:54.106 --> 22:57.809
It's there if you want it.      

22:58.711 --> 23:02.147
              Wow.              

23:10.623 --> 23:12.257
                          STONE:
                  So I was going
                through my...   

23:12.291 --> 23:13.258
ROSE:                           
Options.                        

23:13.292 --> 23:14.592
 Yeah, and the phone shut off.  

23:14.627 --> 23:16.428
 So I tried to turn it back on. 

23:16.462 --> 23:18.163
It said to enter my unlock code,

23:18.197 --> 23:20.698
    so I entered my unlock code,
            and it shut off.    

23:20.733 --> 23:22.233
What's your unlock code?        

23:22.268 --> 23:23.268
                    "Reggie."   

23:23.302 --> 23:25.036
Reggie's your password.         
                     Same thing.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.538
It's not the same thing.        

23:26.572 --> 23:28.606
Your unlock code is             
a four-digit number.            
It's your address.              

23:28.641 --> 23:29.674
              Oh.               

23:29.708 --> 23:30.942
That's why you didn't           
get my messages.                

23:30.976 --> 23:32.177
             What messages?     

23:32.211 --> 23:34.245
I left you four messages.       
Turn it on, it tells you.       

23:34.280 --> 23:36.815
 Yeah, but I can't turn it on.  

23:38.250 --> 23:39.751
So he wouldn't talk to you?     

23:39.785 --> 23:42.353
            He said he couldn't.

23:42.388 --> 23:44.989
            And why can't you   
            hire anyone else?   

23:45.024 --> 23:47.525
Luthor says it's 'cause         
they're going to reinstate you. 

23:47.560 --> 23:49.694
             Well, they're not. 

23:49.728 --> 23:51.830
He says he had a feeling.       
         He gets a lot of those.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.798
Feelings aren't enough, Rose.   

23:53.833 --> 23:55.934
        I know that.            

24:00.239 --> 24:01.739
         What's wrong?          

24:03.442 --> 24:04.576
      Did you call Healy?       

24:04.610 --> 24:06.711
             I did.             

24:06.745 --> 24:08.880
  Did you ask him to hire me?   

24:08.914 --> 24:10.782
     Don't do that, Jesse.      

24:10.816 --> 24:12.550
     It doesn't become you.     

24:15.721 --> 24:17.322
Does Suit confide in you?       

24:17.356 --> 24:18.523
         More and more.         

24:18.557 --> 24:20.658
                  Well, you need
                    to help him.
    I don't know how.           

24:20.693 --> 24:22.894
      I do, but you're not      
    supposed to talk to me.     

24:22.928 --> 24:24.295
    I don't care about that.    

24:24.330 --> 24:26.097
      You're not supposed       
         to talk to me.         

24:26.131 --> 24:27.765
    I don't care about that.    

24:31.203 --> 24:33.104
            Call me?            

24:33.138 --> 24:34.973
          Or call me.           

24:52.258 --> 24:54.459
                          HASTY:
    There's no way to repair it.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.161
    Looks pretty good           
    to me, Hasty.               

24:57.196 --> 24:58.796
                     I'm talking
            about your Scout.   

24:58.831 --> 25:00.999
          The boys can't fix it.
            Can't find parts.   

25:01.033 --> 25:03.368
        How long did you have   
        that thing up on blocks?

25:03.402 --> 25:04.469
        A couple years.         

25:04.503 --> 25:06.237
            Well, it's hopeless.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.139
                You lived on the
Atlantic Ocean, Jesse-- rust.   

25:08.173 --> 25:10.608
Well, I didn't think about it.  
L.A.'s a desert.                

25:10.643 --> 25:12.777
Of course, the insurance company
doesn't know that it's hopeless.

25:12.811 --> 25:15.413
          Maybe we could arrange
    a little accident, you know.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.181
                Your Scout could
            have caught fire.   

25:17.216 --> 25:18.550
  You fought through the flames.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.018
That would be illegal, Hasty.   

25:20.052 --> 25:22.954
You're not my parole officer.   

25:22.988 --> 25:24.722
                I'm not insured.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.324
                  Oh.           

25:26.358 --> 25:28.526
             Well, this thing is
          way beyond your means.

25:28.561 --> 25:29.661
I was admiring.                 

25:29.695 --> 25:31.429
                  Ah.           

25:31.463 --> 25:34.232
          I think I've got maybe
         just the thing for you.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.167
             Follow me.         

25:36.201 --> 25:39.103
                 I see you found
                    your bowtie.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.805
Yeah. Sissy boxed               
everything up                   

25:40.839 --> 25:42.640
the first first day             
I was in prison.                

25:42.675 --> 25:45.543
The day I got out, there was    
a envelope waiting for me       

25:45.578 --> 25:47.078
        with a storage          
        room key in it.         

25:47.112 --> 25:48.413
                 What'd she say?

25:48.447 --> 25:50.181
    No, no, there               
    was no note.                
                    Sweet.      

25:50.215 --> 25:52.684
        She won't               
        return my calls.        

25:52.718 --> 25:54.819
                  Could you turn
                 that thing off?

25:54.853 --> 25:56.154
              Oh.               

25:56.188 --> 25:57.388
        This is it.             

26:00.726 --> 26:02.460
Jesse, have you seen Sissy?     

26:02.494 --> 26:04.362
                  No.           

26:05.898 --> 26:08.967
You don't think                 
that I still think...           

26:09.001 --> 26:11.302
'Cause I...                     
I don't think...                

26:12.237 --> 26:13.504
    What do you think?          

26:13.539 --> 26:15.440
              About Sissy?      

26:15.474 --> 26:16.808
            (sighs)             

26:16.842 --> 26:18.743
         About the car?         
                Can't afford it.

26:18.777 --> 26:21.512
Well, Jesse, you know           
I'm very fond of you.           

26:21.547 --> 26:24.382
Hasty, every time you say that, 
     something bad happens.     

26:24.416 --> 26:25.717
            Can I test-drive it?

26:25.751 --> 26:27.452
Sure. Take it around            
the block for a spin.           

26:27.486 --> 26:32.256
  Actually, I was hoping I could
 test-drive it for about a week.

26:33.826 --> 26:37.528
    It shouldn't be that hard   
    to find an owner for her.   

26:37.563 --> 26:39.364
             You just never try.
That's not true.                

26:39.398 --> 26:40.431
            You never wanted to.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.701
            It's understandable.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.903
                You know, you   
                  got a divorce.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.038
You had to put your dog down.   

26:47.072 --> 26:48.139
            Wasn't that right   
                 around the time

26:48.173 --> 26:49.941
                 your girlfriend
                was murdered?   
        Yes.                    

26:49.975 --> 26:51.309
            Existential despair.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.177
    That sounds awful.          

26:53.212 --> 26:54.646
     Numbness of the heart.     

26:54.680 --> 26:55.880
    I'm a psych major.          

26:55.914 --> 26:57.448
    You <i>were</i> a psych major.     

26:57.483 --> 26:59.984
 Don't you think it's time you  
 went back and finished school? 

27:00.019 --> 27:02.854
             That's a big step. 

27:02.888 --> 27:04.188
    Not really, Emily.          

27:04.223 --> 27:06.224
Have you talked to your parents 
     since they moved away?     

27:06.258 --> 27:08.493
              No.               

27:08.527 --> 27:10.495
     Numbness of the heart.     

27:12.765 --> 27:14.966
          The clerk at          
      the Final Stop died.      

27:15.000 --> 27:18.269
                  Claire gave me
        a picture of the robber,

27:18.303 --> 27:20.171
  but it doesn't do much good,  
        you know.               

27:20.205 --> 27:21.506
    You can't see his face.     

27:21.540 --> 27:23.775
I want you to be careful.       

27:23.809 --> 27:25.777
                He says we're   
                 an easy target.

27:25.811 --> 27:26.844
    Convenience stores are.     

27:26.879 --> 27:30.415
                 You looking out
                  for me, Jesse?

27:30.449 --> 27:32.216
          I like you.           

27:32.251 --> 27:35.420
  I was hoping you could feed   
    Reggie if I'm in Boston.    

27:35.454 --> 27:37.588
     Why didn't you say so?     

27:37.623 --> 27:39.223
          I just did.           

27:39.258 --> 27:41.392
              What are you doing
                in Boston?      

27:41.427 --> 27:42.760
Can't tell you.                 

27:42.795 --> 27:44.228
     Why can't you tell me?     

27:44.263 --> 27:48.032
    I don't know. Old habit.    

27:48.067 --> 27:49.801
                 A new number.  

27:49.835 --> 27:52.570
    I don't want anyone else    
          to have it.           

27:56.875 --> 28:01.079
    (thunder rumbling           
    and rain falling)           

28:20.599 --> 28:23.901
        (wind whistling)        

28:35.447 --> 28:37.448
            (sighs)             

28:42.755 --> 28:44.722
            (sighs)             

29:04.176 --> 29:06.644
            (sighs)             

29:22.828 --> 29:25.963
    (distant siren wailing)     

29:25.998 --> 29:28.833
    I'm sorry. I don't know     
what else I can tell you.       

29:28.867 --> 29:30.101
HEALY:                          
I understand.                   

29:30.135 --> 29:32.370
I just thought that after       
     you've had this time,      

29:32.404 --> 29:34.172
    if you could think          
        of any argument         

29:34.206 --> 29:37.508
or any grudge she may           
have had with someone.          

29:40.312 --> 29:42.480
         My wife had no enemies.

29:45.851 --> 29:47.785
If you can, uh,                 

29:47.820 --> 29:49.187
think of anything,              
anything at all,                

29:49.221 --> 29:51.622
even if it doesn't              
seem important,                 

29:51.657 --> 29:53.891
you have my number,             
Mr. Jackson.                    

30:01.400 --> 30:04.435
    I don't know what           
    to say to my kids.          

30:11.510 --> 30:14.478
MAN:                            
Hey, Joe, we've got the         
coroner's office on...          

30:14.513 --> 30:17.281
        (phone ringing)         

30:17.316 --> 30:19.483
                            MAN:
                    Homicide.   

30:25.858 --> 30:27.959
        Mother of three.        

30:29.962 --> 30:31.395
    Press is outside,           
        waiting for him.        

30:31.430 --> 30:32.897
    They're traitors.           

30:32.931 --> 30:35.833
  After they're done sticking   
      cameras in his face,      

30:35.868 --> 30:36.968
    he's just debris.           

30:37.002 --> 30:38.369
Nobody ever sees that.          

30:38.403 --> 30:39.537
                     We do.     

30:39.571 --> 30:41.806
     So, what do you think?     

30:41.840 --> 30:44.408
     I think we need to get     
      this son of a bitch.      

30:44.443 --> 30:47.178
      Ballistics are back.      
        Same gun.               

30:47.212 --> 30:49.280
             Your people come up
                 with anything? 

30:49.314 --> 30:50.414
Not hardly.                     

30:50.449 --> 30:52.083
I don't know where to go.       

30:52.117 --> 30:53.451
        I do. You're supposed   
                to be at rehab. 

30:53.485 --> 30:55.486
         Oh...                  

30:55.520 --> 30:58.589
That's not what I meant.        

30:58.624 --> 31:01.692
    If you got nowhere to go,   
    go back to the beginning.   

31:08.066 --> 31:10.568
      (electrical buzzing)      

31:12.504 --> 31:17.174
                (sweeping floor,
    distant tires screeching)   

31:36.728 --> 31:39.430
(fluorescent bulb buzzing)      

32:01.820 --> 32:03.421
    (glass shattering)          

32:27.145 --> 32:28.713
                    Hello, Alan.

32:28.747 --> 32:30.114
        It's flattering         

32:30.148 --> 32:32.650
you remember my name.           
Where's your hat?               

32:32.684 --> 32:35.586
        My hat is home.         
    I called. I spoke to...     

32:35.620 --> 32:37.722
Spoke to me.                    
                That was you?   

32:37.756 --> 32:39.156
          That was me.          

32:39.191 --> 32:41.659
            You don't sound like
            you on the phone.   

32:41.693 --> 32:43.527
    Mr. Fish is in.             

32:45.130 --> 32:47.231
  You're not going to give me   
    a hard time, Alan?          

32:47.265 --> 32:49.033
            You called, asked if
              you could see him.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.234
            I said I'd find out.

32:50.268 --> 32:52.236
  That's the way we do things.  

32:52.270 --> 32:53.604
  (keys beeping, door buzzes)   

32:53.638 --> 32:55.973
So, Mr. Fish is in.             

32:56.008 --> 32:57.274
He's having lunch.              

32:57.309 --> 32:58.476
                You're not going
                    to join him?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.644
      I already had lunch.      

33:12.057 --> 33:15.593
                    Jesse Stone.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.829
Clearly, you are not here       
on an official capacity.        

33:18.864 --> 33:20.531
Because I'm not wearing my hat? 

33:20.565 --> 33:23.234
'Cause you've been              
suspended-- without pay,        

33:23.268 --> 33:25.169
I believe.                      

33:25.203 --> 33:29.040
I read the papers.              
Keep up on things.              

33:29.941 --> 33:32.176
Mm. Please.                     

33:33.879 --> 33:35.746
                    Actually,   

33:35.781 --> 33:38.749
                 I am here in an
              official capacity.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.885
How so?                         
              I'm doing odd jobs

33:40.919 --> 33:42.987
                for the state   
             homicide commander.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.656
You're a handyman.              

33:45.690 --> 33:46.791
                    Sort of.    

33:46.825 --> 33:48.092
I'm sorry.                      

33:48.126 --> 33:50.895
I didn't offer you              
anything. Scotch?               

33:50.929 --> 33:53.097
                Coffee.         

33:54.032 --> 33:55.299
            Steven?             

33:55.333 --> 33:58.736
                Chief Stone will
            have some coffee.   

33:58.770 --> 34:02.339
You know, it's not good         
for your nerves.                

34:02.374 --> 34:06.143
Much as I enjoy                 
your usual banter,              

34:06.178 --> 34:08.411
you do have a reason            
for being here.                 

34:08.447 --> 34:09.513
    Huh?                        

34:09.547 --> 34:13.184
                    You said you
                read the papers.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.237
This would be                   
about the killings?             

34:33.271 --> 34:34.672
                 It would.      

34:35.540 --> 34:39.009
Hey, I'm just                   
a boxing promoter.              

34:41.446 --> 34:43.813
          How long did the first
            victim work for you?

34:46.251 --> 34:47.685
                     John Kelly.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.155
I know of no such person.       

34:51.188 --> 34:53.791
            I'm told he was a   
             business associate.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.960
I know of no such person.       

34:55.994 --> 34:57.795
                Well, let's just
                  assume you do.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.530
    I don't.                    

34:59.564 --> 35:03.100
It was nice seeing you          
again, Jesse Stone.             

35:19.017 --> 35:21.285
I thought you already had lunch.

35:21.319 --> 35:25.122
  I have an enormous appetite.  

35:25.157 --> 35:27.024
Did you have                    
a nice visit?                   

35:27.058 --> 35:29.193
        Did you know John Kelly?

35:29.227 --> 35:31.562
        Why do you ask?         

35:31.596 --> 35:32.930
He did some work for Gino.      

35:34.966 --> 35:37.067
 What exactly did my boss say?  

35:37.102 --> 35:38.936
        He said, "I know        
      of no such person."       

35:38.970 --> 35:40.271
    He said it twice.           

35:42.207 --> 35:44.675
I know of no such person.       

35:44.709 --> 35:47.912
So, what do you know            
about Sissy and your deputy?    

35:47.946 --> 35:49.413
            What deputy is that?

35:49.447 --> 35:51.215
I'm not talking                 
about Rose Gammon.              

35:51.249 --> 35:53.817
        And what would I know   
            about our temp chief

35:53.852 --> 35:55.019
                      and Sissy?

35:55.053 --> 35:56.153
I know you know.                

35:56.188 --> 35:57.588
         Hasty, you're divorced.

35:57.622 --> 35:59.456
I'm still in love               
with her, Jesse.                

35:59.491 --> 36:02.259
I think                         
she still loves me.             

36:02.294 --> 36:03.794
            I don't think so.   

36:03.828 --> 36:05.329
How would you know?             

36:05.363 --> 36:06.330
                    Hasty, I got
                to get going.   

36:06.364 --> 36:07.264
All right, all right.           

36:07.299 --> 36:09.800
                 Just sign these
            wherever it says.   

36:09.834 --> 36:11.635
                There, there.   

36:11.670 --> 36:13.337
Initials,                       
everything.                     

36:13.371 --> 36:15.206
                Just testing it.

36:15.240 --> 36:16.507
Yeah, for a week.               
I need you to be insured.       

36:16.541 --> 36:17.708
Besides,                        
that car fits you.              

36:17.742 --> 36:18.809
You drive it around             
for a week,                     

36:18.843 --> 36:19.944
you're not going to             
be able to part with it.        

36:19.978 --> 36:21.779
                So you think.   
So I know.                      

36:21.813 --> 36:22.813
Don't worry.                    
I'm going to find Hanson.       

36:22.847 --> 36:26.817
        Hasty, you go to prison,

36:26.851 --> 36:28.219
            you pay a huge fine,

36:28.253 --> 36:29.286
                    and Sissy   
                  gets the rest.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.921
I wanted her                    
to have that.                   
                        Yeah.   

36:30.956 --> 36:35.693
    I know. So, who's staking   
     you in your new enterprise?

36:35.727 --> 36:36.961
Don't ask.                      

36:36.995 --> 36:39.763
                    Then I don't
                want to know.   

36:39.798 --> 36:41.031
So, your hearing's              
coming up?                      

36:41.066 --> 36:42.166
                          It is.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.901
And you're going to             
piss off the Town Council?      

36:43.935 --> 36:46.403
              Just some of them.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.072
That's not very smart.          

36:48.106 --> 36:49.907
                    I didn't say
                it was smart.   

36:49.941 --> 36:50.941
                Old habit.      

36:50.976 --> 36:53.143
             Actually, I'm going
                 to be contrite.

36:53.178 --> 36:56.180
                     I'm working
                  on the new me.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.348
Because?                        

36:57.382 --> 36:58.582
                I need this job.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.817
                You should know.
                You hired me.   

36:59.851 --> 37:01.919
Town Council's                  
going to clean house.           

37:01.953 --> 37:05.422
                How do you know?

37:05.457 --> 37:07.424
I used to be their boss.        

37:07.459 --> 37:08.559
And you made enemies.           

37:08.593 --> 37:10.427
            I'm good at that.   

37:10.462 --> 37:12.463
They're...                      
                Coffee?         

37:12.497 --> 37:14.632
Sure. All right.                
Thanks.                         

37:16.468 --> 37:18.669
                     No, thanks.

37:18.703 --> 37:19.970
Thank you.                      
        You're welcome.         

37:20.005 --> 37:23.374
Listen, they are going          
to let everybody go.            

37:28.947 --> 37:30.414
          Any particular reason?

37:30.448 --> 37:35.386
Well, a statement was made that 
they'd been infected by you.    

37:35.420 --> 37:37.354
Carter Hanson's going           
to lead the charge.             

37:37.389 --> 37:38.889
                  I would expect
                 no less of him.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.557
They're going to use the        
convenience store robbery       

37:40.592 --> 37:42.126
as an excuse,                   
and that's why                  

37:42.160 --> 37:44.395
they're not letting them        
hire more people to help.       

37:44.429 --> 37:46.630
                 They don't want
            them to solve it.   

37:46.665 --> 37:49.366
Carter Hanson doesn't           
want them to solve it.          

37:50.902 --> 37:53.270
          You got a problem with
      Suitcase? Why do you care?

37:55.206 --> 37:57.808
      It's just not right.      

38:01.680 --> 38:04.081
I'm very fond of you, Jesse.    

38:32.911 --> 38:34.778
How you feeling?                

38:34.813 --> 38:36.814
                  Better.       

38:36.848 --> 38:38.382
Chief Stone?                    
                  Jesse.        

38:38.416 --> 38:40.484
He didn't need to hit me, Jesse.

38:40.518 --> 38:42.252
     He, uh...                  
                    Liked it?   

38:42.287 --> 38:44.221
He seemed amped up.             

38:44.255 --> 38:45.823
                  Meth head.    

38:45.857 --> 38:47.024
                Why did he stop?

38:47.058 --> 38:49.326
Well, some guy                  
came by the door,               

38:49.361 --> 38:51.528
saw me getting beaten up,       
and he walked away.             

38:51.563 --> 38:53.597
                    Nice.       

38:53.631 --> 38:55.032
      Gum change the taste      
         of the scotch?         

38:55.066 --> 38:56.367
     It would if I let it.      

38:56.401 --> 38:58.669
    You chew the gum first,     
it's going to change the taste. 

38:58.703 --> 39:00.938
    It's two separate deals.    

39:00.972 --> 39:02.473
            Meaning?            

39:02.507 --> 39:04.007
Meaning, I bought the gum,      
    and I bought the scotch.    

39:04.042 --> 39:05.209
 Doesn't mean they go together. 

39:05.243 --> 39:06.343
    Well, no, they don't.       

39:06.378 --> 39:08.078
        Gives the scotch        
a kind of metallic taste.       

39:08.113 --> 39:10.748
Do you have a surveillance      
      tape of the robbery?      

39:10.782 --> 39:11.949
        Not anymore.            

39:11.983 --> 39:13.650
        Record over it?         

39:13.685 --> 39:14.885
 Hartford police chief has it.  

39:16.688 --> 39:18.355
     When was the last time     
    you changed tapes           

39:18.390 --> 39:19.790
      before the robbery?       

39:19.824 --> 39:21.425
Uh... couple of hours before.   

39:21.459 --> 39:24.027
          Could I have that one?
You chew the gum                
after the scotch,               

39:24.062 --> 39:26.029
 it's the same thing: metallic. 

39:29.401 --> 39:31.168
    I'll get the tape.          

39:34.539 --> 39:36.507
     Rose, where'd you put      
     the surveillance tape      

39:36.541 --> 39:37.674
        of the robbery?         

39:37.709 --> 39:39.209
I want to work                  
on it tonight.                  

39:39.244 --> 39:41.044
    I left it at home.          

39:41.079 --> 39:42.112
              I'm sorry, Luthor.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.180
Can you bring it                
in the morning?                 

39:43.214 --> 39:44.348
                         I will.

39:45.850 --> 39:47.351
Think I'm qualified             
for this?                       

39:47.385 --> 39:49.119
    Of course you are.          

39:49.154 --> 39:51.321
    Have you talked to him?     

39:51.356 --> 39:53.023
      I'm not allowed to.       

39:53.057 --> 39:55.359
        How is he?              

39:57.462 --> 39:59.763
        He's pretty beat up     
    about the suspension.       

39:59.798 --> 40:02.666
                     He seems...

40:02.700 --> 40:04.468
            freighted down.     

40:04.502 --> 40:07.070
     Self-doubt.                

40:10.008 --> 40:11.575
You think I want Jesse's job?   

40:11.609 --> 40:14.812
We can't stake out              
every target.                   

40:14.846 --> 40:16.780
Well, we can't talk to him.     

40:16.815 --> 40:18.549
      No, we can't.             

40:18.583 --> 40:21.718
     If I'm not up to this,     
        you can tell me.        

40:21.753 --> 40:24.755
    You're up to it, Luthor.    

40:24.789 --> 40:26.390
      I'll bring the tape       
        in the morning.         

40:45.009 --> 40:47.578
(thunder rumbling, rain pouring)

41:08.233 --> 41:10.434
    (thunder rolling)           

41:10.468 --> 41:12.536
        (tape squealing)        

41:13.805 --> 41:15.873
    (static crackling)          

41:30.154 --> 41:31.455
        (remote clicks)         

41:31.489 --> 41:33.590
        (tape squealing)        

41:52.010 --> 41:54.344
        (knocking)              

41:54.379 --> 41:55.812
        (remote clicks)         

42:03.454 --> 42:04.721
              You were expecting
                someone else?   

42:04.756 --> 42:06.356
      Everybody says that.      

42:06.391 --> 42:08.325
            Where have you been?
                I called you.   

42:08.359 --> 42:09.960
I've been right here.           

42:09.994 --> 42:11.995
          Is your cell phone on?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.664
        Yes.                    

42:13.698 --> 42:15.132
Want a drink?                   

42:15.166 --> 42:17.634
    How many is that?           

42:17.669 --> 42:19.169
    (thunder rolling)           

42:19.203 --> 42:21.071
        That was direct.        

42:21.105 --> 42:22.539
          This is two.          

42:22.574 --> 42:25.642
Well, then I'll have one.       

42:31.549 --> 42:32.649
        You okay?               

42:32.684 --> 42:34.484
  I'm fine. What have you got?  

42:34.519 --> 42:35.519
            Scotch.             

42:35.553 --> 42:36.954
         Got any soda?          

42:36.988 --> 42:39.022
              Just Scotch.      
Scotch.                         

42:39.057 --> 42:42.025
Neat. You're in a dead zone.    

42:42.060 --> 42:43.493
        Thank you.              

42:43.528 --> 42:44.861
No.                             

42:44.896 --> 42:46.563
      You have no service.      
     You're in a dead zone.     

42:46.598 --> 42:49.933
Well, that's fine with me.      

42:54.305 --> 42:56.373
Paradise surveillance tape.     

42:56.407 --> 42:58.075
    How did you know?           

42:58.109 --> 42:59.376
Know what?                      

42:59.410 --> 43:01.044
                     That Luthor
                    wanted that.
I didn't.                       

43:01.079 --> 43:04.047
                  Well, he does.
Well, I think                   
you should give it to him.      

43:04.082 --> 43:06.950
The Heartford Liquor Store      
just before the robbery.        

43:06.985 --> 43:10.420
          What am I looking for?
I'm not gonna tell you.         
I just got a feeling.           

43:10.455 --> 43:12.522
                 Feelings aren't
                enough, Rose.   

43:12.557 --> 43:14.091
Tell me about it.               

43:14.125 --> 43:17.060
        So now I should tell him
             I've got a feeling?

43:17.095 --> 43:19.963
No. You should tell him         
you have a theory.              

43:22.100 --> 43:24.234
    (thunder rolling)           

43:32.810 --> 43:36.046
          I'm getting a divorce.

43:42.353 --> 43:44.221
Can't make it work?             

43:44.255 --> 43:46.089
        I won't make it work.   

43:46.124 --> 43:47.724
            Not anymore.        

44:06.244 --> 44:08.211
          Jim-- he...           

44:08.246 --> 44:10.013
            He's...             

44:11.783 --> 44:13.884
            A drunk?            

44:16.187 --> 44:18.321
    Small town.                 

44:23.094 --> 44:27.531
            I don't know how    
            to tell my boys.    

44:29.534 --> 44:32.536
They might already              
have it figured out, Rose.      

44:35.673 --> 44:37.674
I'll make some coffee.          

44:51.756 --> 44:53.557
                Good night, Dad.
Good night, honey.              

45:08.706 --> 45:10.707
    (tires squealing)           

45:10.742 --> 45:13.610
    (distant siren wailing)     

45:18.382 --> 45:20.584
     (keyless entry remote      
         chirps twice)          

45:23.187 --> 45:25.155
         (cat yowling)          

45:25.189 --> 45:28.558
    (tires screeching)          

45:29.894 --> 45:31.495

45:31.529 --> 45:32.796

45:40.404 --> 45:41.671
        (bird squawking)        

45:41.706 --> 45:43.840
      (bell buoy clanging)      

46:22.346 --> 46:24.481
      (cell phone ringing)      

46:28.886 --> 46:30.854
      This thing working?       

46:30.888 --> 46:33.990
 We, uh... we got another one.  

46:34.025 --> 46:34.891
        (zapping)               

46:34.926 --> 46:36.693
        (siren whooping)        

46:36.727 --> 46:39.062
      (indistinct chatter)      

46:39.096 --> 46:41.364
    MAN (over radio):           
         South entrance         
      to the parking lot.       

46:41.399 --> 46:43.400
No pattern.                     

46:43.434 --> 46:45.969
            Lack of pattern's   
            sometimes a pattern.

46:46.003 --> 46:47.938
Michael Wrightel, 58.           

46:47.972 --> 46:49.873
Took his daughter               
out to dinner.                  

46:49.907 --> 46:51.041
Three kids all notified.        

46:51.075 --> 46:53.910
.22 to the head.                

46:53.945 --> 46:55.712
No cases, no witnesses.         

46:55.746 --> 46:57.080
                     He's smart.

46:57.114 --> 46:58.315
                            MAN:
            Driver said that?   

46:58.349 --> 46:59.416
Early bird was looking          

46:59.450 --> 47:00.984
for a parking spot,             
found the body,                 

47:01.018 --> 47:02.185
called the attendant,           

47:02.220 --> 47:04.221
who called the police           
who ultimately ID'd the body.   

47:04.255 --> 47:08.758
It took some doing              
to locate the daughter.         

47:08.793 --> 47:10.694
                  She was, uh...

47:10.728 --> 47:12.896
(Healy's voice trails off)      

47:18.669 --> 47:20.804
(camera shutters clicking)      

47:40.124 --> 47:41.291

         (siren chirps)         

47:51.836 --> 47:53.937
Turn around, you son of a bitch.

47:55.439 --> 47:58.575
        (grunting)              

48:03.648 --> 48:05.649
STONE:                          
So, why'd you lie?              

48:05.683 --> 48:07.384
          I never lie.          

48:07.418 --> 48:08.718
Okay.                           

48:08.753 --> 48:11.621
        Why'd you leave         
     the wrong impression?      

48:11.656 --> 48:13.590
          Jesse Stone.          

48:13.624 --> 48:15.859
         We never talk          
about what we're talking about. 

48:15.893 --> 48:17.994
                    And besides,

48:18.029 --> 48:20.063
              your impression of
                our conversation

48:20.097 --> 48:21.898
         is your responsibility.

48:21.933 --> 48:24.301
This isn't going                
very well, is it?               

48:24.335 --> 48:26.536
Why wouldn't you admit          
he worked for you?              

48:26.570 --> 48:28.972
      Just among friends?       

48:29.006 --> 48:32.842
      Just among friends,       
    I did employ him.           

48:32.877 --> 48:35.111
    His name was John Kelly.    

48:35.146 --> 48:36.846
              I know that.      
And for                         
what purpose                    

48:36.881 --> 48:38.248
did you employ Mr. Kelly?       

48:38.282 --> 48:40.984
  (men chattering and grunting  
          in distance)          

48:41.018 --> 48:42.953
          Get coffee.           

48:42.987 --> 48:45.789
When's the last time            
you saw him?                    

48:45.823 --> 48:48.491
  Two days before he was killed.

48:48.526 --> 48:49.826
    He was the first.           

48:49.860 --> 48:51.761
        How do you know         
     there's more than one?     

48:51.796 --> 48:52.963
                    Jesse Stone,

48:52.997 --> 48:55.332
that's not worthy of you.       

48:55.366 --> 48:56.700
    I read the papers.          

48:56.734 --> 48:59.235
     Newspapers didn't say      
the three were connected.       

48:59.270 --> 49:01.171
            Please.             

49:01.205 --> 49:03.306
  You think there'll be more?   

49:03.341 --> 49:05.642
      Just among friends?       

49:05.676 --> 49:07.077
             I do.              

49:07.111 --> 49:08.244
              Hmm.              

49:08.279 --> 49:11.247
You saw him two days            
before he was murdered?         

49:11.282 --> 49:12.749
             I did.             

49:12.783 --> 49:15.485
     I'm sure my secretary      
  can confirm the time frame.   

49:15.519 --> 49:17.821
    Oh, he's not here.          

49:17.855 --> 49:19.422
    Grocery shopping.           

49:19.457 --> 49:22.792
                            MAN:
                      Now you've
                got it. Good.   

49:22.827 --> 49:24.995
        (boxers panting)        

49:25.029 --> 49:27.397
         (boxer gasps)          

49:27.431 --> 49:29.566
      (indistinct chatter)      

49:33.404 --> 49:35.171
    Sister Mary John.           

49:35.206 --> 49:37.140
          Jesse Stone.          

49:39.243 --> 49:40.744
Gino's not on my list.          

49:40.778 --> 49:42.379
    What list is that?          

49:42.413 --> 49:44.180
It's kind of a micro list       

49:44.215 --> 49:46.449
      of pimps and various      
         other abusers          

49:46.484 --> 49:48.218
of my girls.                    

49:48.252 --> 49:49.753
      Micro guys get most       
        of my attention.        

49:50.654 --> 49:52.822
     Is there a macro list?     

49:52.857 --> 49:55.959
  Oh, yeah, but that one's not  
        really up to me.        

49:55.993 --> 49:58.094
Suffice it to say               
that on his passing,            

49:58.129 --> 50:00.296
    Gino Fish will be going     
    straight to hell.           

50:00.331 --> 50:03.233
        What's Gino's deal      
          with his secretary?   

50:03.267 --> 50:06.302
  Alan has lasted much longer   
        than most.              

50:06.337 --> 50:10.607
      He thinks nobody knows, or
    at least won't say out loud.

50:10.641 --> 50:12.242
The vanity of a powerful man.   

50:13.177 --> 50:14.878
Actually,                       

50:14.912 --> 50:16.880
Alan's on the outs.             

50:16.914 --> 50:19.115
I'm repeating gossip.           

50:19.150 --> 50:20.850
That's not                      
in my job description.          

50:20.885 --> 50:23.686
                (sighs)         

50:23.721 --> 50:26.890
Can I ask you something?        

50:27.792 --> 50:29.759
                 Jesse?         

50:29.794 --> 50:32.762
Can I ask you something, Jesse? 

50:32.797 --> 50:34.798
                (sighs)         

50:34.832 --> 50:37.267
          Is it a hard question?

50:37.301 --> 50:39.235
    I don't think so.           

50:39.270 --> 50:41.638
        Is Gino Fish why        
      we're having dinner?      

50:42.506 --> 50:45.909
        I don't think so.       

50:45.943 --> 50:47.644
 Why did you ask me to dinner?  

50:48.579 --> 50:50.780
That might be a shrink question.

50:50.815 --> 50:52.182
    I'm not a shrink.           

50:52.216 --> 50:53.616
        I'm a nun.              

50:53.651 --> 50:55.618
          I know that.          

50:55.653 --> 50:58.121
Can I tell you something?       

50:58.155 --> 50:59.823
            You can.            

51:01.392 --> 51:04.427
         I don't know what to do
        at dinner with a nun.   

51:04.462 --> 51:07.130
I thought I did, but I don't.   

51:07.164 --> 51:08.998
            You eat.            

51:09.033 --> 51:10.467
    Nuns need to eat, Jesse.    

51:10.501 --> 51:12.402
                  Hmm.          

51:12.436 --> 51:15.605
  See, I didn't have a problem  
when there was nothing at stake.

51:15.639 --> 51:20.443
Not that there's anything       
         at stake now.          

51:24.815 --> 51:27.250
          Do nuns drink wine?   

51:28.152 --> 51:30.286
        They can.               

51:39.964 --> 51:42.499
      (bell buoy clanging,      
    crickets chirping)          

51:49.006 --> 51:51.407
         (door opening)         

51:51.442 --> 51:53.543
    (footsteps approaching)     

51:57.681 --> 52:01.317
If you're not the cleaning lady,
  I want to know who you are.   

52:01.352 --> 52:03.319
    You sound like me.          

52:03.354 --> 52:05.255
      I saw the light on.       

52:05.289 --> 52:07.590
    Shouldn't be here, Lieu.    

52:07.625 --> 52:10.160
         No one saw me.         

52:10.194 --> 52:12.028
    Pull the blinds if you want.

52:12.062 --> 52:14.931
How are things                  
in Boston, Jesse?               
                 How'd you know?

52:14.965 --> 52:16.733
  The information's out there.  

52:16.767 --> 52:18.168
All you have to do is let it in.

52:18.202 --> 52:20.570
 You working on the robberies?  

52:23.274 --> 52:24.674
    You got anything?           

52:24.708 --> 52:26.776
            Nothing.            

52:29.346 --> 52:32.515
  You can't make the evidence   
fit your intuition, Suit.       

52:32.550 --> 52:33.983
The evidence speaks for itself. 

52:34.018 --> 52:35.084
You have to listen to it.       

52:35.119 --> 52:38.087
  Told me that your first day   
          on the job.           

52:39.857 --> 52:42.125
    My hearing's gonna          
        be a formality.         

52:42.159 --> 52:46.262
    After I'm gone, they're     
gonna let you and Rose go.      

52:49.400 --> 52:53.369
There is concern that some      
  of me has rubbed off on you.  

52:53.404 --> 52:55.171
            It has.             

52:58.042 --> 52:59.609
            You need to solve   
                these robberies.

52:59.643 --> 53:01.244
He doesn't come back;           
I don't think                   

53:01.278 --> 53:02.478
      that's gonna happen.      

53:02.513 --> 53:05.081
If he does come back, Rose and I

53:05.115 --> 53:07.083
can't be everywhere.            
                 I want to help.

53:07.117 --> 53:09.152
        You can't.              

53:11.055 --> 53:13.523
I need to help, Suitcase.       

53:13.557 --> 53:15.758
        You can't.              

53:15.793 --> 53:17.093
        I won't let you.        

53:18.762 --> 53:20.396
            (sighs)             

53:20.431 --> 53:23.933
    It is what it is, Jesse.    

53:50.761 --> 53:53.162
             Good morning, Rose.

53:54.632 --> 53:57.700
                Hey, loser, take
                a look at these.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.069
        This was taken at the   
            Paradise final stop,

54:00.104 --> 54:01.738
and this was taken at           
the Heartford robbery.          

54:01.772 --> 54:03.439
          What's the time frame?
This was taken                  

54:03.474 --> 54:04.974
         about 45 minutes before

54:05.009 --> 54:08.011
        and this about two hours
before the Heartford robbery.   

54:08.045 --> 54:09.979
Where'd you get this            
Heartford picture?              
                I went there.   

54:10.014 --> 54:12.081
That's good                     
police work, Rose.              

54:12.116 --> 54:13.349
What's it tell us?              

54:13.384 --> 54:16.519
    That he was at both crime   
    scenes buying cigarettes.   

54:16.553 --> 54:18.721
         He could've been casing
        a target for the robber.

54:18.756 --> 54:19.689
    Could be a coincidence.     

54:19.723 --> 54:22.058
  Cops don't like coincidence.  

54:22.092 --> 54:23.159
Hartford's like Paradise.       

54:23.193 --> 54:24.627
Close to the main highway       

54:24.662 --> 54:25.962
with easy access in and out.    

54:25.996 --> 54:27.330
Somebody commuting to Boston    

54:27.364 --> 54:29.966
    could decide to stop at     
  either one on any given day.  

54:30.000 --> 54:32.201
 If we could just talk to him.  

54:32.236 --> 54:35.138
How do we find                  
a bald guy who smokes?          

54:35.172 --> 54:37.440
                          STONE:
         You ever seen that guy?

54:37.474 --> 54:39.575
I don't know, I don't think so. 

54:39.610 --> 54:41.344
Is this about the robberies?    

54:41.378 --> 54:43.846
                    Could be.   

54:43.881 --> 54:44.947
Well, who is he?                

54:44.982 --> 54:46.182
                     Just a guy.

54:46.216 --> 54:48.318
      If you see him, I want you
          to call me right away.

54:48.352 --> 54:49.852
             He'll buy nonfilter
                     cigarettes.

54:49.887 --> 54:51.554
How do you know?                
                    I just know.

54:51.588 --> 54:53.156
      You're not smoking.       

54:53.190 --> 54:56.059
          Not anymore.          

54:56.994 --> 54:58.761
        You want a gun?         

54:58.796 --> 55:01.130
        Should I?               

55:02.032 --> 55:04.500
  If you know how to use one.   

55:04.535 --> 55:06.569
            (sighs)             

55:06.603 --> 55:07.970
  Cops aren't supposed to say   
      that kind of thing.       

55:08.005 --> 55:10.973
I'm not a cop; I'm a consultant.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.278
You're always looking out       
         for me, Jesse.         

55:15.312 --> 55:17.380
    If you see him, call me.    

55:17.414 --> 55:22.051
        If there's no answer,   
                leave a message.

55:32.930 --> 55:34.163
                     You closed?

55:34.231 --> 55:37.300
    It's 6:00.                  

55:37.334 --> 55:39.635
                 I was hoping to
            get in a workout.   

55:39.670 --> 55:40.937
You box?                        

55:40.971 --> 55:42.271
              No, I fight.      

55:42.306 --> 55:44.073
What's the difference?          

55:44.108 --> 55:45.942
                 Rules.         

55:45.976 --> 55:48.311
        Nice car.               
It is.                          

55:48.345 --> 55:49.779
        What do you know        
    about John Kelly?           

55:49.813 --> 55:52.982
I know that he's dead.          

55:55.152 --> 55:56.352
What else do you know about him?

55:56.387 --> 55:58.688
I know that I didn't like him.  

55:58.722 --> 56:00.823
Does that make me               
a suspect, Chiefster?           

56:00.858 --> 56:02.625
                Jesse.          

56:02.659 --> 56:04.227
    You and your boss are close.

56:04.261 --> 56:07.029
What do you mean, Jesse?        

56:07.064 --> 56:10.366
  Well, you have meals together.

56:10.401 --> 56:13.970
John Kelly was a climber.       

56:14.004 --> 56:17.707
I don't like people             
taking advantage of my boss.    

56:17.741 --> 56:20.343
        (chuckles)              

56:20.377 --> 56:21.811
    Mr. Fish said you might     
      want to talk to him.      

56:21.845 --> 56:23.679
        I always like talking   
                to you, Alan.   

56:23.714 --> 56:24.981
     The last time Mr. Fish     

56:25.015 --> 56:26.883
      saw him was two days      
    before he was murdered.     

56:26.917 --> 56:29.051
          You've been briefed.  

56:29.086 --> 56:31.154
            I have.             

56:33.524 --> 56:34.891
When's the last time            
you saw him?                    

56:34.925 --> 56:38.528
Two days before he was murdered.

56:38.562 --> 56:39.529
    You have plans tonight?     

56:39.563 --> 56:42.398
     Are you asking me out?     

56:42.433 --> 56:44.066
              No.               

56:44.101 --> 56:45.368
You and Gino are having dinner? 

56:45.402 --> 56:47.837
    I'm going home tonight.     

56:47.871 --> 56:51.140
I have a life beyond work.      

56:59.349 --> 57:02.351
        (phone ringing)         

57:02.386 --> 57:03.352
             Healy.             

57:03.387 --> 57:04.654
         You called me.         

57:04.688 --> 57:07.023
Okay, we got John Kelly's       

57:07.057 --> 57:08.591
         lab reports.           

57:08.625 --> 57:10.259
          Toxicology,           
     credit card receipts.      

57:10.294 --> 57:11.961
            Nothing.            

57:11.995 --> 57:13.763
  What did he buy the day of?   

57:13.797 --> 57:16.332
 He went to a department store  
 and some place called Milly's. 

57:16.366 --> 57:17.900
        What's Milly's?         

57:17.935 --> 57:19.635
  I don't know, haven't had a   
  chance to check it out yet.   

57:19.670 --> 57:22.171
         Anything else?         

57:22.206 --> 57:23.406
        Not hardly. You?        

57:23.440 --> 57:26.142
          Not hardly.           

57:26.176 --> 57:28.311
      I missed something.       

58:32.709 --> 58:34.844
      (people chattering)       

58:55.232 --> 58:56.666
Hey.                            

58:59.102 --> 59:00.570
    (change jingling)           

59:06.777 --> 59:08.110
                        Really? 
                        Yeah.   

59:08.145 --> 59:10.246
            (indistinct chatter)

59:36.173 --> 59:38.007
        Excuse me.              

59:38.041 --> 59:40.710
                 Sorry.         

59:48.552 --> 59:50.553
       <i>I heard screams...</i>       

59:50.587 --> 59:52.154
    from another room.          

59:52.189 --> 59:54.590
        I went in.              

59:54.625 --> 59:58.260
There was this drugged-out dope 
 dealer on top of a young girl. 

59:58.295 --> 01:00:00.763
         Skirt was up,          
      clothes were ripped,      

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:01.964
                 she was crying.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:05.368
    "Get off of her!" I said.   

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:08.204
        Turned around, he looked
          at me like I was nuts.

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:11.374
        "She's choice," he said.

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:15.845
            Said he was gonna   
                kill her anyway,

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:17.780
            so why not put her  
            to good use first?  

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:19.315
                He said it like 
            I should understand.

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:22.585
    What'd you do?              

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:26.455
    I kicked him in the face.   

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:29.325
     He spit out some teeth     
        and he stood up.        

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:32.662
    Bleeding all over           
      the hardwood floor.       

01:00:32.696 --> 01:00:37.266
 Just stood there staring at me 
  with this smirk on his face.  

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.702
    So I shot it off.           

01:00:41.805 --> 01:00:44.774
  Put two more in his chest, the
  girl jumped up out of the bed,

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:48.244
    ran out the back.           

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.613
 That was my last day as a cop. 

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:55.284
    Broke open a key of coke,   
      spread it around the room,

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:58.287
         found his gun,         
      put it in his hand,       

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:01.557
      drug deal gone bad.       

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:04.060
    The girl never surfaced.    

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:06.762
    Nobody knew what I did.     

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:08.230
          I went home,          

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:12.334
              pounded a fifth of
          scotch and passed out.

01:01:12.369 --> 01:01:15.838
    I woke up with a hangover   
            and a revelation.   

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:20.876
    The job and the drinking    
        feed each other.        

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:22.344
             Toxic.             

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:25.414
    You love the work.          

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:30.486
                 I hate fishing.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.221
        So do I.                

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:34.290
        So why'd you suggest it?

01:01:34.324 --> 01:01:36.325
Seemed like a good              
idea at the time.               

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.227
Doesn't cost me anything.       

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.496
                I'll bill you   
            for a house call.   

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:43.599
It's freezing out here.         

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:47.369
     You figure it out yet?     

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.407
I don't think it's              
the kind of thing               

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.743
where a lightbulb goes on.      

01:01:53.777 --> 01:01:58.080
     Is it Jen or is it the work
        that makes you drink?   

01:01:58.115 --> 01:01:59.915
      Hell, I don't know.       

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.350
         Could be both,         
    I'm not a shrink.           

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.220
      I prefer therapist.       

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.921
     When you're on a case,     
        you don't drink.        

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:07.123
        I always drink.         

01:02:07.157 --> 01:02:09.125
        If I'm involved         
 ,I don't like to drink a lot.  

01:02:09.159 --> 01:02:12.428
     You once told me you wanted
          to kill her boyfriend.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:13.729
              Did you mean that?

01:02:13.764 --> 01:02:15.464
I was jealous.                  

01:02:15.499 --> 01:02:18.601
  That's not much of an answer  
         for a shrink.          

01:02:18.635 --> 01:02:21.670
         Jealousy isn't         
     a good enough reason?      

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:23.939
  Jealousy's a powerful thing.  

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:29.578
         What I want to know is,
      do you think you meant it?

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.516
          I meant it.           

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:36.519
So if you could've gotten       
      your hands on him...      

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:39.421
      I'd have killed him.      

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:43.392
  Jealousy's a powerful thing.  

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.399
(fluorescent bulb buzzing)      

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.638
      (car tires squealing      
          in distance)          

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:30.906
        (eerie rumbling)        

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.241
        (gunshot)               

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:36.412
(whooshing sound echoing)       

01:03:44.187 --> 01:03:46.822
  (gun firing in slow motion)   

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:51.193
  (whooshing sound fades out)   

01:03:51.228 --> 01:03:53.829
        (rain pattering)        

01:03:54.731 --> 01:03:56.866
    (thunder rumbling)          

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:02.671
            (sighs)             

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:15.384
        Why Alan Garner?        
              Something's hinky.

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:17.019
Breakups are hinky.             

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:18.320
    Tell me about it.           

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.322
Alan Garner-- background.       

01:04:20.357 --> 01:04:23.325
     Born in Havril, 1978.      

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.327
         Mother, Selma.         

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:26.695
    Father not listed.          

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:30.699
Bachelor's degree--             

01:04:30.734 --> 01:04:32.568
    business administration,    
    Boston University.          

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.703
    Master's degree--           
      criminal psychology.      

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:37.239
             Okay.              

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:39.141
         Two incidents          
     of domestic violence.      

01:04:39.175 --> 01:04:40.743
Both charges dropped.           
                How long ago?   

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:44.046
Last one... 2002.               

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.047
          Before Gino.          

01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:47.816
        Why Alan Garner?        

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:48.884
    Just accumulating data.     

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.219
        No, you're not.         

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:51.620
             Jesse.             

01:04:51.655 --> 01:04:54.490
How much you think you can      
hold back and still work for me?

01:04:58.295 --> 01:05:00.296
              I don't think John
            Kelly was random.   

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:02.231
              I think the killer
              walked up the ramp

01:05:02.265 --> 01:05:04.300
    till he found Kelly's car   
             and waited for him.

01:05:04.334 --> 01:05:05.935
        Why Alan Garner?        

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:07.703
      I think he could've       
    done the killings.          

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.072
        You think?              
                Yeah.           

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.207
    You got a motive?           

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:13.542
     Milly's is a gay bar.      

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:15.544
    I think John Kelly          
     and Gino had a thing,      

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.279
and his main squeeze Alan       
        found out               

01:05:17.314 --> 01:05:19.448
        about it, he got jealous
             and he killed them.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:22.518
      When he calmed down,      
    he decided to kill more.    

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.520
So how did he select            
two and three?                  
                 I have no idea.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:26.956
  You think he killed two and   
 three to make it look random?  

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.991
Cover up the motive?            
                That's about it.

01:05:29.025 --> 01:05:31.193
Why'd you go to Gino?           

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:33.262
    I don't know Bixy Chappelle;
            Leo Finn's dead.    

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:35.297
    So, it's a guess.           

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:36.498
                It is.          

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:37.967
I guess that's why you hired me.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:38.968
It is.                          

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:40.669
I think you're a good guesser.  

01:05:40.704 --> 01:05:41.904
            Look, he's smart.   

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.405
        He went to school.      

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.940
     He knows criminal behavior.

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:46.208
        He knows how we work.   

01:05:46.242 --> 01:05:47.343
      I know Alan Garner.       

01:05:47.377 --> 01:05:48.877
        I don't see him         
out of control like this.       

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:50.779
 Jealousy is a powerful thing.  

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:53.282
      Where does he live?       

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:58.954
         Right... here.         

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:18.407
I had nothing to do             
with the killings.              

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:19.641
                I know that.    

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:20.976
     Then why the intrigue?     

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:22.544
         I needed to talk to you
                  in private.   

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.546
            This is public.     

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:26.081
Which makes it private.         

01:06:26.116 --> 01:06:27.649
Were you with Alan Garner       

01:06:27.684 --> 01:06:29.051
the night John Kelly            
was murdered?                   

01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:31.387
              No.               

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.890
    I want to tell you a story. 

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.927
                You want to tell
                     me a story.

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:41.930
              I do, since you're
                  not his alibi.

01:06:41.965 --> 01:06:45.167
            I think he killed   
                     John Kelly.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:47.469
     You think.                 

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.371
     Know but can't prove.      

01:06:49.406 --> 01:06:51.640
Alan? Why would he?             

01:06:51.674 --> 01:06:54.676
I mean, assuming                
he's capable of that.           

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:56.678
                 He was jealous.

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:59.681
Alan would be                   
jealous of what?                

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:02.084
 Alan is a business associate.  

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:05.220
 He might've been afraid he was 
  going to lose his position.   

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.523
Why would he think that?        

01:07:07.557 --> 01:07:09.558
        Maybe you took a meeting
                 with Mr. Kelly,

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:12.795
                and Alan assumed
                      the worst.

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:14.930
             Did you know he has
            a master's degree   

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.932
         in criminal psychology?

01:07:16.966 --> 01:07:18.567
No, I didn't.                   

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:20.536
                  Well, he does.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.905
     So he would know that if he
    killed at least two more,   

01:07:22.939 --> 01:07:25.007
    it would look like random   
                serial killings.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.842
Indicating a sickness.          

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.844
              Not for me to say.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.813
                    Maybe he's a
             ruthless sociopath,

01:07:30.847 --> 01:07:32.548
                      or a sick,
             ruthless sociopath.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:33.615
            I don't really care.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.085
Why should I care?              

01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:38.020
                 A serial killer

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.322
who's your personal assistant   
         might not look too good

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:43.425
                     on a boxing
              promoter's résumé.

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:47.062
And you're telling me           
all this because...?            

01:07:47.097 --> 01:07:50.065
 I'm just giving you a heads up.

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:53.001
          I'm going after him.  

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:56.271
                If I'm right,   
             and I think I am...

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:00.709
         ...this is going to get
                 in the papers. 

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:05.247
    (sighs)                     

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:07.583
Anything you want to tell me?   

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:13.655
I think you're stirring         
the pot, Jesse Stone.           

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:15.257
         I am stirring the pot. 

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:19.461
It's a ridiculous story.        

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:22.631
                It is, isn't it?

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.935
I don't know                    
what I was thinking.            

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:30.205
Thanks for straightening        
me out, Gino.                   

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.947
    Not at all, Jesse Stone.    

01:08:40.683 --> 01:08:43.352
    ROSE (over phone):          
         Where are you?         
        STONE: I'm home.        

01:08:43.386 --> 01:08:44.586
Kind of.                        

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.154
         I called you.          
You didn't check your messages. 

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:48.756
     I checked my messages;     
    that's why I'm calling.     

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.893
     I gave Emily a picture     
          of the guy.           
         ROSE: I know.          

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.194
    STONE: How do you know?     
  Because I gave her one, too.  

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.497
And I also gave one to the      
  new clerk at the final stop.  

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:56.965
And the guy in Heartford?       

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.401
             I did.             
 That's good police work, Rose. 

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.036
    What's the chief think?     

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:02.871
        He doesn't think        
     our smoke is relevant.     

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.872
            (sighs)             
    You going to the range?     

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:07.876
             ROSE:              
The temp chief is adamant       
        about practice.         

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:10.078
     Good. How you feeling?     

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:15.584
Well... I'm glad I have my work.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.823
     Jesse, are you there?      

01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:25.260
Yeah. Keep in touch with Emily, 
        will you?               

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:27.662
Oh, she checks in all the time. 

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:28.897
        Thank you.              

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:30.232
And check your messages...      

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.401
    (line disconnects)          

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.973
      (crickets chirping)       

01:09:59.162 --> 01:10:01.263
    (entrance bells ringing)    

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.167
         (door closes)          

01:10:30.326 --> 01:10:32.461
      (crickets chirping)       

01:11:02.659 --> 01:11:04.926
      Did Sue talk to you?      

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:06.161
          What about?           

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:08.297
            Nothing.            

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.967
                  Where were you
                  when I called?

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.168
             Home.              

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.536
Your phone doesn't work at home.

01:11:16.439 --> 01:11:18.607
 I was watching Emily close-up. 

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.008
 You were looking out for her?  

01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.877
             I was.             

01:11:21.911 --> 01:11:23.545
Why couldn't you just say that? 

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:26.415
         I don't know.          

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.383
  Might be a shrink question.   

01:11:30.286 --> 01:11:32.220
        How'd you feel?         

01:11:32.255 --> 01:11:34.189
        How did I feel?         

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:36.158
      When you moved out.       

01:11:36.192 --> 01:11:38.060
That was different, Rose.       

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:40.162
              You got a divorce,
                     didn't you?

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:41.363
    Jen got a divorce.          

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:43.932
    Jesse, you're divorced.     

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:46.968
Everywhere but in my mind.      

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.839
            How many is that?   

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.974
This is one.                    

01:11:54.844 --> 01:11:56.878
  I haven't slept in a while.   

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:58.413
    How long a while?           

01:11:58.448 --> 01:11:59.848
 How long since I've been here? 

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.049
    Three days.                 

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:02.617
                Three days.     

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.922
        I read somewhere        
     that two drinks a day      

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.924
is good for your heart.         

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:10.125
So I made a rule--              

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.727
    two drinks a day.           

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:13.729
That would give me              
something                       

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.464
to look forward to              
every evening,                  

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:17.499
        but it wouldn't         
    scramble my brain.          

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.068
  So, when I'm thinking right,  

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:22.337
      two drinks a day is       
      about right for me.       

01:12:22.372 --> 01:12:25.140
Don't let me fall asleep.       

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:28.377
      My mom's bringing the boys
            back in the morning.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:33.415
     So, how did you feel?      

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:35.717
             Awful.             

01:12:35.752 --> 01:12:37.753
    Awful's one word.           

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:39.554
     How about a sentence?      

01:12:39.589 --> 01:12:41.123
            (sighs)             

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.326
 When Jen and I were together,  

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.995
    I tried to pay attention    
      to what she wanted.       

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:49.164
    If she was happy,           
    I always said to myself,    

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.766
        I'm happy.              

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.034
Wasn't true, but I thought      
      it ought to be true.      

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:56.805
    So, I insisted on trying    
        to make it true,        

01:12:56.839 --> 01:13:00.041
     no matter how unhappy      
      it made both of us.       

01:13:06.816 --> 01:13:09.985
    Town Council's going to     
    let everybody go, Rose.     

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:19.060
         (wry chuckle)          

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.252
      (door sliding open)       

01:14:19.155 --> 01:14:21.456
     (sliding door closes)      

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:32.601
      (phone line ringing)      

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:38.540
  (bell buoy clanging faintly   
          in distance)          

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:47.983
    (phone ringing through)     

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:49.518
This is Jesse. Leave a message. 

01:14:49.552 --> 01:14:50.685
             (beep)             

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:53.355
    Jesse, he's here.           

01:14:53.389 --> 01:14:56.625
Pack of fives, please.          

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:03.131
        (phone ringing)         

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:10.672
             Hello.             

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:12.774
             STONE:             
  Jealousy's a powerful thing.  

01:15:12.808 --> 01:15:14.109
          Who is this?          

01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:15.377
    Where do you keep           

01:15:15.411 --> 01:15:16.778
    your .22 revolver, Alan?    

01:15:16.812 --> 01:15:18.713
  How did you get this number?  

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:21.182
     You're much too smart      
to leave it lying around,       

01:15:21.217 --> 01:15:22.484
    so where'd you hide it?     

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:23.785
          I do not own          

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:24.819
         any firearms.          

01:15:24.854 --> 01:15:25.887
            You mean            

01:15:25.922 --> 01:15:27.088
         you do not own         

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.224
 any legally acquired firearms. 

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:30.225
          Same thing.           

01:15:30.259 --> 01:15:31.192
    Not hardly, Alan.           

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.394
     I'm going to hang up.      

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:34.563
             Okay.              

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.634
            Alan...             

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:41.736
      you're still there.       

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.306
    I guess you want to know    
          what <i>I</i> know.          

01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.374
          Did you know          
 the woman had three children?  

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:48.410
    Horrible tragedy.           
    What do you want, Stone?    

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:50.445
     Jesse. What do I want?     

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.614
        Well, I want you        

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:54.649
    to go to the state          
    homicide commander          

01:15:54.684 --> 01:15:56.785
    and explain how and why     
         you did this.          

01:15:56.819 --> 01:15:58.320
        Did what?               

01:15:58.354 --> 01:15:59.788
     You're not gonna talk      

01:15:59.822 --> 01:16:01.990
to Captain Healy, are you, Alan?

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:03.558
 I know you have issues, Stone. 

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:04.893
             Jesse.             

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:06.461
        Are you drinking        
    right now, Jesse?           

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.796
I'm talking to you, Alan.       

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:11.666
    Did you do the third one    
 because I showed up at Gino's? 

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:14.102
  I deeply resent that, Alan.   

01:16:15.605 --> 01:16:17.639
I don't think you're psychotic. 

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:19.274
        Well, thank you.        

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:21.743
    Now, sociopaths--           

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:23.845
     they feel no remorse,      
    they have no conscience.    

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.313
    They feel no obligation     

01:16:25.348 --> 01:16:27.983
      even to the families      
  of the people they prey on.   

01:16:28.017 --> 01:16:29.184
        They just               

01:16:29.218 --> 01:16:31.019
          don't care.           

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:33.154
    But then you know that.     

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:37.125
What? No clever response?       

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:40.996
    You're a cold, ruthless,    
  sociopathic son of a bitch.   

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:43.131
            So what?            

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:46.134
 I'm going to haunt you, Alan.  

01:16:46.168 --> 01:16:47.535
 If what you're saying is true, 

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:49.104
     there's really nothing     
      you can do about it.      

01:16:49.138 --> 01:16:51.006
        Sure, there is.         
    I could just shoot you.     

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.608
    You'll be wanting           
         to talk to me.         

01:16:53.643 --> 01:16:54.943
        How do you know?        

01:16:54.977 --> 01:16:56.845
    We read the same books.     

01:16:56.879 --> 01:16:59.247
        I'll be sitting         
at an outside table at Milly's. 

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:01.049
 I believe you know the place.  

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.384
             3:00.              

01:17:02.418 --> 01:17:04.619
    I won't be there.           

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:06.621
    (phone beeps off)           

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.733
            (sighs)             

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:43.224
        (retching)              

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.646
            Oh! Oh!             

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.681
    (grunts and gasps)          

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:10.085
Open it up. Open it up!         
Put the money in a bag!         

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:13.621
    (tires squealing)           

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.859
Hurry up!                       
             (whimpers)         

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:21.362
     (gun chamber clicking)     

01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:24.432
                            MAN:
                    Hurry up!   

01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:29.838
Pick it up!                     

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:31.306
Hurry up!                       
             Okay.              

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.707
          Okay. Okay.           

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:36.211
Police! Put the gun on the      
counter and back away from her. 

01:18:36.245 --> 01:18:38.613
I want to see                   
your hands at all times.        

01:18:38.647 --> 01:18:39.814
    (scoffs)                    

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:41.549
             Do it!             

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.389
                (gasps)         

01:18:52.128 --> 01:18:53.394
            (gasping)           

01:18:53.429 --> 01:18:55.730
      (gun drops on table)      

01:18:59.568 --> 01:19:01.669
             Put the revolver on
             the passenger seat.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:09.010
        With your right hand,   
            give me the keys.   

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:15.917
                    Put these on
            your right wrist.   

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:17.919
          I'll bet you know how.

01:19:20.656 --> 01:19:21.856
     (handcuffs tightening)     

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:25.760
         Give me your left hand.

01:19:27.463 --> 01:19:29.664
 (handcuffs click and tighten)  

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:32.534
          You don't want to mess
          with those two inside.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:34.702
      Those cops are man-eaters.

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:29.157
     (seagulls screeching)      

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:31.326
    (wings fluttering)          

01:21:04.660 --> 01:21:08.029
    (women screaming)           

01:21:08.063 --> 01:21:09.163
    (tires screeching)          

01:21:09.198 --> 01:21:11.232
         (horn honking)         

01:21:11.267 --> 01:21:13.534
(people screaming and shouting) 

01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:16.671
            (sighs)             

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:19.340
  (garbled radio transmission)  

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.442
        (siren blaring)         

01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:25.413
        Was he meeting you?     

01:21:25.447 --> 01:21:26.915
Don't ask.                      

01:21:26.949 --> 01:21:28.149
            I just did.         

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:31.753
I was just having coffee        
at my favorite gay bar, Officer.

01:21:31.787 --> 01:21:33.288
Did he have the weapon?         

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.856
                    No.         

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:37.759
    He dumped it.               

01:21:37.793 --> 01:21:39.560
Maybe I pushed too hard.        

01:21:39.595 --> 01:21:40.762
            You sure it was him?

01:21:40.796 --> 01:21:41.896
Pretty sure.                    

01:21:41.931 --> 01:21:43.331
                          Proof?

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:46.401
Just 'cause there's no proof    
doesn't mean it isn't true.     

01:21:46.435 --> 01:21:48.503
        Did you get a look      
        at the plates?          

01:21:48.537 --> 01:21:49.871
        No plates.              

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:53.207
          Got a candidate?      

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.176
I got a nominee.                

01:21:55.210 --> 01:21:56.911
            He'll have an alibi.

01:21:56.946 --> 01:21:58.713
            He will.            

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:00.248
Why would Gino take the risk?   

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:03.384
 I guess Alan was a bigger one. 

01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:05.853
          How am I gonna be sure
                  it was him?   

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:08.056
     You'll be pretty sure      
     if the killings stop.      

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:11.025
         It's not gonna help me 
            with the press.     

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.227
That's way above                
my pay grade.                   

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:18.399
            (sighs)             

01:22:19.802 --> 01:22:21.970
        (wind whistling)        

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.848
        (clock ticking)         

01:23:45.988 --> 01:23:49.190
        (sighing)               

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.825
        (clock ticking)         

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:54.028
     (pen tapping on glass)     

01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:07.875
    (footsteps approaching,     
      thudding on stairs)       

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:35.136
                  (sighs)
