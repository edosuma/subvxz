Not much we can do

- Mm-hmm.

Well, even if he does,

to the bathtub.

39:10.115 --> 39:13.380
You know why?

Because I knew that

He's a patient of mine.

Pale, skinny kid, always drawing pictures.

She wasn't entirely coherent.
She needs medical assistance.

But why did you want to talk
to this woman at 1:00 in the morning?

49:52.757 --> 49:55.419

It's an emergency situation.

<i>that I have bad dreams.</i>

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:55.482
- That's my favorite line in the whole play.
- <i>It's a good line.</i>

01:04:55.592 --> 01:04:58.026
However, my favorite line
of the play is:

01:04:58.128 --> 01:05:01.962
"O what a rogue
and peasant slave am I."

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:05.899
I have no idea what any of it means,
but I love the word "slave."

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:09.131

- Hi.

01:05:26.490 --> 01:05:30.017
I always pictured Hamlet as a man.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:33.062
That's a bit narrow-minded
of you, isn't it?

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.291
This is the lesbian Hamlet.
All the parts are played by women.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.630
- Oh.
- <i>I'm joking.</i>

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:42.364
I'm Ophelia.
I just get so sick of playing her.

Things get tough,
she jumps in the drink.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.933
Hamlet hogs all the good lines.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:50.036
Well, he's notorious for that.

01:05:50.147 --> 01:05:52.445
We've met before, haven't we?

01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:55.746
No, I don't think so.
I'm Sam Foster.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:57.319

- Hi.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:59.981
Hi. Are you joining the class?

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:02.650
No. I've been looking for you,
as a matter of fact.

01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:05.387
That's flattering. Why?

01:06:05.495 --> 01:06:09.761
I'm a psychiatrist,
and I have a patient who, uh...

01:06:09.866 --> 01:06:12.630
likes you very much.

01:06:12.736 --> 01:06:15.728
That's an unusual way
of trying to get a date.

01:06:17.107 --> 01:06:19.007
- What's his name?
- Henry Letham.

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:21.839
- Sounds familiar.
- You served him coffee in a diner a couple of times.

01:06:21.945 --> 01:06:24.914
You were nice to him. But the way
he tells it, you're the one good thing...

01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:27.506
that ever happened to him.

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:30.450
Henry.
Is he very pale, very thin?

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:33.614
- His arms are scarred.
- Yeah, that's him.

01:06:33.724 --> 01:06:36.625
He always ate pecan pie with his coffee.
I remember that.

01:06:36.727 --> 01:06:38.627
But I never spoke to him
outside the diner.

01:06:38.729 --> 01:06:40.788
- Oh.
- Except-

01:06:40.897 --> 01:06:42.922
Yeah? What?

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.831
I feel really stupid saying this stuff
to a psychiatrist.

01:06:45.936 --> 01:06:48.131
- You'll think I'm insane.
- No.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.634
I had the strangest feeling
about him.

01:06:51.742 --> 01:06:53.767
I mean, he's this
ragged-looking guy.

01:06:53.877 --> 01:06:57.369
Probably hasn't bathed in months,
but something about him.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:07:00.973
I'd seen him before.
Somewhere.

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:03.678
I'd known him.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:07.848
- Yeah.
- What's wrong with him?

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:10.859
He's going to kill himself.

01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:12.690
Why?

01:07:12.796 --> 01:07:16.323
He thinks he's done something terrible.
That's my guess anyway.

01:07:16.433 --> 01:07:19.834
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:24.566
Actually, this probably won't help,
but I did run into him one time at A. Smith's.

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:26.369
- A. Smith's?
- The art bookstore?

01:07:26.476 --> 01:07:28.535
He was sitting in the back, reading.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.545
I don't know.
Maybe he hangs out there.
