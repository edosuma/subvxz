<i>{\a3}Tony fucked up, Sid fucked up,
Jal's fucked up worse than any of us</i>

00:23.561 --> 00:25.719
{\a3}but it doesn't
all have to turn to shit.

00:28.084 --> 00:29.652
<i>{\a3}I'll love you for ever, Sid.</i>

00:29.772 --> 00:30.772
<i>{\a3}You will?</i>

00:31.176 --> 00:32.826
<i>{\a3}Yes. That's the problem.</i>

01:06.096 --> 01:08.638
EVERYONE

01:56.830 --> 01:58.280
Oh, I'm loving that.

01:59.741 --> 02:01.091
Oh, yeah, Cassie.

02:02.675 --> 02:03.675
Great.

02:05.955 --> 02:07.434
Mmm, yeah.

02:08.204 --> 02:09.554
... little finger.

02:10.455 --> 02:11.456
Sid.

02:14.929 --> 02:16.479
Yeah, and your thumb.

02:22.123 --> 02:23.123
Tony.

02:24.611 --> 02:25.611
Hi.

02:26.997 --> 02:28.147
How come I...?

02:28.498 --> 02:30.148
You locked yourself out.

02:30.846 --> 02:33.085
Right. So I came here.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.139
You'd been drinking - you thought
we were still best friends.

02:37.351 --> 02:39.101
How come we were drinking?

02:39.275 --> 02:42.341
We all went out - it was
Chelle's idea to cheer up Jal.

02:42.461 --> 02:45.200
Well, take her mind off it, anyway.

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
And did it?

02:49.304 --> 02:50.304
No.

02:52.070 --> 02:54.792
Final question -
my hand being on my bollocks...

02:55.919 --> 02:57.169
That's just you.

02:57.750 --> 02:58.750
Right.

03:10.432 --> 03:12.261
You should forget about her.

03:12.381 --> 03:14.103
- Who?
- Cassie.

03:14.356 --> 03:17.919
- What? Who's talking about her?
- She's gone. It's time to move on.

03:18.088 --> 03:21.560
I've already forgotten about her. I
haven't thought about her for days.

03:22.007 --> 03:22.840
All right.

03:24.315 --> 03:25.364
I'm just saying.

03:25.484 --> 03:28.095
Yeah, I hear what you're saying,
Tone, but, well

03:28.215 --> 03:29.976
one - I wasn't talking about her,

03:30.096 --> 03:32.335
B - today's about
A - Chris and B - results,

03:32.455 --> 03:34.856
so that leaves no room
for 3 - Cassie,

03:34.976 --> 03:36.879
and D - it's none of your business.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.680
I got that slightly confused.

03:43.132 --> 03:45.520
- If you wanna talk...
- Why would I want to talk to you?

03:49.037 --> 03:51.134
Actually, there is one thing...

03:51.254 --> 03:52.199
Yeah?

03:53.500 --> 03:54.950
Are you naked, too?

03:56.596 --> 03:58.566
No, again, that's just you.

03:59.359 --> 04:00.409
Right, well,

04:01.701 --> 04:05.645
I know it's your bedroom, but would
you mind getting out of bed first?

04:07.004 --> 04:08.004
OK, Sid.

04:23.189 --> 04:25.142
- You all right, Mum?
- Sid.

04:28.392 --> 04:30.142
Sid, where have you been?

04:30.830 --> 04:34.580
I've been up all night - I'd
thought you'd done something stupid.

04:36.118 --> 04:39.160
I forgot my keys. I slept at Tony's.
I didn't wanna wake you.

04:39.914 --> 04:41.907
Sid... are you OK?

04:42.592 --> 04:43.592
Yes.

04:44.227 --> 04:46.377
I know today's gonna be difficult.

04:47.202 --> 04:48.919
When we buried your Dad...

04:49.080 --> 04:50.477
- Mum!
- It's just...

04:50.597 --> 04:52.279
I could call in sick, if you like.

04:52.914 --> 04:53.959
If you wanna talk.

04:56.395 --> 04:57.445
Sid, wait!

05:00.569 --> 05:01.919
This came for you.

05:05.901 --> 05:07.000
And this.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.720
Looks like girl's handwriting.

05:54.796 --> 05:57.707
So... this is odd.

06:00.081 --> 06:02.231
You... me...

06:02.947 --> 06:05.760
my bedroom... my bed.

06:12.034 --> 06:13.684
I need answers, Cassie.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.999
I need answers right now!

06:22.627 --> 06:24.877
Can I speak to Sid Jenkins, please?

06:26.844 --> 06:27.844
You are.

06:28.267 --> 06:29.469
Oh, you're Sid?!

06:29.589 --> 06:32.288
Oh! I imagined you'd be fatter
for some reason,

06:32.408 --> 06:33.839
with bigger ears!

06:36.200 --> 06:38.440
Facebook.
I looked you up on Chris' Facebook,

06:38.851 --> 06:41.351
you left more comments in his... box

06:41.471 --> 06:43.771
than any of the other children.

06:44.396 --> 06:46.640
Don't have any photos of
you there, though, do you?

06:46.760 --> 06:49.419
Just little pictures
of Batman characters.

06:50.585 --> 06:52.855
- I like Batman.
- Right.

06:52.989 --> 06:54.639
Sorry, but who are you?

06:54.801 --> 06:58.536
Oh, did I not introduce myself?
I'm Graham, Graham Miles.

06:59.786 --> 07:02.824
- You're Chris' dad.
- Yes, that's right. Can I come in?

07:22.174 --> 07:23.174
So...

07:24.275 --> 07:27.497
Would you like a drink?
I've got more or less everything.

07:27.883 --> 07:31.033
Um, tea, coffee, whisky, beer,

07:31.153 --> 07:33.173
orange, apple... chocolate milk.

07:33.293 --> 07:34.996
No! Thanks. I'm fine.

07:37.425 --> 07:39.616
I've come about the funeral.

07:40.478 --> 07:41.454
Right.

07:41.574 --> 07:43.450
You see, the thing is,

07:43.818 --> 07:47.096
I've got a lot of relatives
coming to this funeral...

07:47.653 --> 07:48.742
Sid.

07:48.862 --> 07:51.039
Some from
as far away as Basingstoke.

07:51.765 --> 07:55.880
Yes. And they remember Chris
as a kind, gentle fun-loving boy,

07:56.143 --> 07:58.793
and I'd really like
to maintain that image.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.320
And I think the best way
of maintaining that image

08:03.917 --> 08:05.486
is you not coming.

08:07.555 --> 08:08.355
What?

08:08.475 --> 08:10.715
I don't want you at the funeral.

08:12.880 --> 08:14.886
Any of you... friends.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.144
We, um, we won't spoil anything.

08:20.528 --> 08:22.999
I mean, and Chris, he was
totally a fun-loving guy...

08:23.166 --> 08:25.440
Don't tell me what my son was!

08:26.856 --> 08:29.840
I know what he was.
And I know what you are.

08:30.589 --> 08:33.719
The junkie friends
who brought him down with them.

08:34.278 --> 08:35.078
But...

08:35.240 --> 08:37.313
I'm his father.
It's my son's funeral -

08:37.433 --> 08:39.822
you will respect my wishes,
is that clear?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.305
- Crystal.
- Good.

08:48.051 --> 08:49.801
I'll find my own way out.

08:58.641 --> 09:00.470
- He can't do this!
- If we talked to him...

09:00.590 --> 09:02.448
- He's a psycho!
- Right.

09:02.939 --> 09:05.604
Chris is our friend.
You know, it's our funeral.

09:05.724 --> 09:08.680
Don't take it so personally - he's
just throwing his weight around.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.174
Fuck you!

09:12.480 --> 09:14.363
No, Sid. I know how you feel.

09:14.483 --> 09:18.400
Like you do! You don't know how
I feel these days. Postcards...

09:18.853 --> 09:21.120
fucking results, and dads.

09:21.531 --> 09:24.737
And now we're not allowed to bury
our friend. And you don't even care!

09:24.857 --> 09:26.159
So why are you here?

09:26.321 --> 09:28.372
Sid, what do you want me to do?

09:30.507 --> 09:32.133
No, I didn't...

09:33.960 --> 09:35.110
I don't know.

09:39.275 --> 09:40.529
It's just...

09:41.339 --> 09:43.221
I never get to say goodbye.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.770
But, you know, you're right.

09:59.778 --> 10:02.600
Sid and Tony,
Tony and Sid - it's pathetic.

10:02.877 --> 10:06.155
Me coming to you all the time,
hoping for what? What am I?

10:06.275 --> 10:08.040
- Your fucking...
- Look, it's fine.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.319
We'll have our own funeral.

10:12.522 --> 10:13.672
Yeah, great(!)

10:14.504 --> 10:16.582
A funeral with no coffin.

10:16.702 --> 10:19.591
And then we'll sit around
singing Kumba-fucking-ya.

10:19.795 --> 10:21.251
So let's steal it.

10:22.427 --> 10:23.427
What?

10:25.379 --> 10:27.576
Let's steal...

10:27.881 --> 10:29.024
the coffin.

10:31.068 --> 10:32.068
What?

10:32.991 --> 10:35.241
We're going to steal Chris' funeral.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.160
<i>Anwar?</i>

10:48.806 --> 10:50.241
<i>Anwar, are you masturbating?</i>

10:50.361 --> 10:51.361
Mum!

10:52.270 --> 10:53.270
Sorry.

10:53.912 --> 10:57.231
Thought it was a more interesting
thing to ask than "Are you asleep?"

10:57.351 --> 11:00.225
If you have to ask "Are you asleep?"
the chances are they are asleep.

11:00.345 --> 11:02.795
But with masturbating
who can be sure?

11:08.573 --> 11:09.573
So?

11:11.049 --> 11:12.049
What?

11:12.972 --> 11:13.972
So what?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.850
We made a pact, Mum.
No results until after the funeral.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.220
Mark of respect.

11:21.793 --> 11:24.494
I can boil a very hot pan, steam it
open. No-one will know.

11:24.614 --> 11:25.479
I'll know.

11:31.938 --> 11:35.300
If the grades aren't good you
can always work with your father.

11:35.420 --> 11:36.420
I know.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.548
You look very handsome, my son.

11:53.099 --> 11:55.424
I'll make kulfi with lunch, special.

11:56.363 --> 11:57.363
You just...

11:58.138 --> 12:00.088
go back to what you're doing.

12:00.299 --> 12:02.049
Do some more masturbating.

12:33.730 --> 12:34.730
Right.

12:38.676 --> 12:39.676
Right.

13:02.117 --> 13:03.117
Jal.

13:09.982 --> 13:11.732
Jal, shall we get dressed?

13:25.469 --> 13:26.919
Funeral's at three.

13:30.211 --> 13:32.944
Have you ever
climbed inside a duvet cover?

13:34.751 --> 13:35.751
Yeah.

13:37.425 --> 13:38.425
Will you?

13:41.219 --> 13:42.219
Yeah.

13:54.327 --> 13:55.777
Well, this is nice.

13:56.545 --> 13:57.896
Like we're at a sleep-over...

13:58.016 --> 13:59.466
I had the abortion.

14:04.423 --> 14:05.423
OK.

14:13.415 --> 14:15.092
I would have come with you.

14:15.212 --> 14:17.754
No. I needed to do it alone.

14:21.699 --> 14:22.699
OK.

14:26.828 --> 14:28.630
I think we should get out of here.

14:28.750 --> 14:30.000
I want to stay.

14:33.086 --> 14:35.034
I know somewhere we can go.

14:39.226 --> 14:41.754
Zoos are a great place
to think about stuff.

14:41.874 --> 14:42.872
Yeah?

14:42.992 --> 14:43.992
Yeah.

14:45.325 --> 14:46.634
It's just...

14:46.754 --> 14:48.304
it's weird, because...

14:48.913 --> 14:50.663
I get my grades, succeed,

14:51.159 --> 14:53.309
and I'm off to York.
And Tony goes to Cardiff

14:53.429 --> 14:56.770
and we're 600 miles apart, and
that doesn't feel like success.

14:56.890 --> 14:59.040
It doesn't feel like much reward.

14:59.456 --> 15:01.789
You think I've made
a mistake, don't you?

15:03.931 --> 15:06.108
You do. I know you, Michelle.

15:12.868 --> 15:16.759
I think you've made the hardest
decision I've known anyone to make.

15:17.693 --> 15:19.143
That's what I think.

15:21.941 --> 15:23.159
Why are we here?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.542
Special treat?

15:24.662 --> 15:28.384
Take my mind off it? Because I'm
not ten and I don't like animals.

15:28.851 --> 15:29.851
No.

15:30.675 --> 15:33.225
We're not here to
take your mind off it.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.850
This is where I first met Chris.

15:37.011 --> 15:38.011
Yeah?

15:38.507 --> 15:39.507
Yeah.

15:39.908 --> 15:42.374
I was seven. His mum
got talking to mine

15:42.494 --> 15:45.519
and he was this funny little kid
with his hands down his pants

15:45.681 --> 15:47.631
doing impressions of the fish.

15:49.521 --> 15:52.577
I don't know if he
thought he could talk to them or...

15:56.092 --> 15:58.142
I'm not saying forget about him,

15:59.130 --> 16:01.269
because you can't and you shouldn't.

16:01.389 --> 16:02.639
He was special.

16:04.343 --> 16:05.899
But I just think...

16:08.025 --> 16:09.025
fuck it.

16:09.803 --> 16:10.803
What?

16:11.157 --> 16:13.814
Like Chris.
He said, "Fuck it.

16:14.114 --> 16:15.564
"I'll do it my way.

16:16.121 --> 16:18.675
"And the people that love me
will understand why I'm doing it

16:18.795 --> 16:21.179
"because they love me.
Fuck it."

16:25.269 --> 16:26.269
Come on.

16:27.381 --> 16:30.759
You don't think he'd say exactly that
if he was standing here?

16:32.382 --> 16:35.560
He'd probably be too busy
talking bollocks about the fish.

16:40.113 --> 16:41.563
"Fuck it" for Chris?

16:42.124 --> 16:44.560
OK. "Fuck it" for Chris.

16:44.890 --> 16:46.540
Say it like you mean it.

16:47.150 --> 16:49.080
Fuck it. Fuck it. Fuck it!

16:50.321 --> 16:51.439
Come on, Jemima!

16:53.360 --> 16:54.420
Fuck it.

17:03.382 --> 17:04.528
Here we are.

17:05.779 --> 17:06.829
Is this him?

17:07.179 --> 17:08.929
No. It's me as a boy.

17:09.481 --> 17:10.830
Nice-looking boy.

17:13.478 --> 17:14.928
Not nice-looking...

17:18.949 --> 17:21.723
It's just it looks like you had...

17:21.844 --> 17:24.021
have a nice personality.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.976
Um... Obviously attractive.

17:28.096 --> 17:30.327
I'm not saying that you weren't.

17:32.244 --> 17:33.594
It's quite rare...

17:34.161 --> 17:36.311
to have a funeral without a woman.

17:37.396 --> 17:38.957
A mother, a sister.

17:41.189 --> 17:42.836
A girlfriend, a wife.

17:43.950 --> 17:47.100
- It's a bit of a novelty really.
- His mother left.

17:48.198 --> 17:49.648
And his stepmother.

17:50.424 --> 17:51.424
Oh, right.

17:54.720 --> 17:57.609
It's nice though, isn't it?
Father burying his son.

17:58.983 --> 18:00.333
It's... not nice.

18:01.070 --> 18:03.420
It's a nice... novelty for me though.

18:04.632 --> 18:05.632
Right.

18:08.459 --> 18:11.274
Very powerful bond,
fathers and sons.

18:15.793 --> 18:18.714
It's like mothers and daughters,

18:19.640 --> 18:21.909
but different. Less oestrogen.

18:22.029 --> 18:24.079
He just... he just stole my son.

18:53.463 --> 18:54.713
Get in, you tit.

19:03.614 --> 19:04.614
Fuck.

19:04.860 --> 19:06.210
He's really gone.

19:07.904 --> 19:08.904
Yeah.

19:10.857 --> 19:13.680
You know, we could get in real
trouble for this. It might be...

19:13.841 --> 19:15.280
We need to say goodbye, Sid.

19:17.092 --> 19:18.440
We all do.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.009
Thing is, though,

19:22.300 --> 19:24.911
after this there's fuck all
to say goodbye to.

19:25.287 --> 19:27.737
Chris gone, Dad gone,

19:28.026 --> 19:29.430
fucking Cassie.

19:29.550 --> 19:31.000
You and me, we're...

19:31.986 --> 19:32.986
Yeah.

19:34.096 --> 19:36.093
- What are we, Sid?
- Tony...

19:38.535 --> 19:40.920
Shit. Shit! It's him!

19:42.895 --> 19:44.538
We're under control.

19:54.175 --> 19:55.425
Holy fuck, Tone!

20:06.829 --> 20:08.320
Turn right!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.159
Shut up, Sid.

20:11.582 --> 20:13.205
How close are they?

20:13.552 --> 20:15.002
Very fucking close.

20:17.920 --> 20:18.920
Tony. Tony!

20:26.220 --> 20:27.220
Oh, fuck.

20:32.724 --> 20:35.174
- Sid, are you buckled in?
- Yeah, why?

20:40.880 --> 20:41.680
Shit!

20:55.641 --> 20:57.091
I think we lost him.

20:57.317 --> 20:59.920
We have. We fucking have!

21:03.080 --> 21:03.959
Mate.

21:16.856 --> 21:17.856
You OK?

21:18.960 --> 21:21.228
No. I feel uncomfortable.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.956
You're my boyfriend and we're
gonna be living together.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.707
That makes you one of us.

21:26.366 --> 21:28.630
There's no need to
feel uncomfortable.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.100
Maxxie, there's a coffin in the room.

21:31.293 --> 21:33.159
How's that not uncomfortable?

21:33.320 --> 21:35.856
What's going to happen
to those fish? I mean,

21:35.976 --> 21:37.857
someone's got to take 'em.

21:38.933 --> 21:39.733
Hi.

21:39.853 --> 21:40.853
Hi, Maxxie.

21:43.422 --> 21:45.178
We've had a really good morning.

21:45.298 --> 21:48.048
Yeah, we had a pretty
interesting time, too.

21:49.338 --> 21:50.439
Is that what I...

21:53.620 --> 21:55.200
What the fuck is that doing here?

21:57.223 --> 21:58.639
Funny story actually.

21:59.857 --> 22:03.690
Chris's dad came to see me and
he said we couldn't go to the funeral

22:03.840 --> 22:06.759
because we were all junkies,
so I went to Tony, and Tony...

22:07.038 --> 22:08.639
What the fuck have you done?

22:10.609 --> 22:12.852
- The thing is, Jal...
- Give it back.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.563
- What the fuck were you thinking?
- You didn't hear him.

22:15.683 --> 22:19.354
He wouldn't bury Chris as Chris.
We did this for Chris.

22:19.610 --> 22:21.759
- You did it for who?
- I'm not saying...

22:21.925 --> 22:24.599
What right have you?
You stupid, stupid...

22:24.719 --> 22:27.093
- You're not listening.
- No, you're not listening.

22:27.213 --> 22:28.839
There's other ways to do this.

22:29.549 --> 22:30.799
Give it back.

22:31.520 --> 22:32.320
Now!

22:34.471 --> 22:35.280
But...

22:35.967 --> 22:37.717
You do as she says.

22:43.001 --> 22:44.001
OK.

22:48.592 --> 22:49.642
Here we are.

22:55.649 --> 22:57.399
I did say sorry, didn't I?

22:59.442 --> 23:00.792
Wasn't your fault.

23:03.996 --> 23:05.505
I didn't...

23:05.625 --> 23:08.501
think to lock the boot.
You know, you just...

23:08.621 --> 23:10.158
don't think.

23:10.278 --> 23:13.200
I'm not a thinker.
I don't think.

23:14.965 --> 23:16.915
Why would they do this to me?

23:17.119 --> 23:18.506
ASBO culture.

23:19.591 --> 23:21.651
Or Arabs. It's one of the As.

23:22.913 --> 23:25.845
My son, it was my son.

23:28.077 --> 23:31.220
Well, the police are on their way.
They'll find it.

23:31.968 --> 23:32.968
Him.

23:33.657 --> 23:35.505
It. The coffin.

23:39.546 --> 23:41.596
How am I going to explain this?

23:46.385 --> 23:49.663
Right, I'm going to need
an empty coffin and some ballast.

23:51.982 --> 23:54.279
Oh, right. Ballast?

23:54.399 --> 23:58.307
I've got relatives coming expecting
a funeral. It's the only solution.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.250
Oh, no, it isn't.

24:02.370 --> 24:04.581
- I think I know what's best.
- Well...

24:04.701 --> 24:07.220
the best just got better.

24:22.744 --> 24:25.759
I suppose we'll just have to hope
it's the right coffin.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.670
I didn't know anywhere else to go.

24:29.121 --> 24:31.761
I worked hard.
I worked really hard.

24:32.736 --> 24:33.986
And then these.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.039
What grades did you need?

24:53.367 --> 24:55.227
Have you ever played
the five-year test?

24:55.347 --> 24:57.398
What? No, I don't think so.

24:59.118 --> 25:00.800
It's not that wanking game, is it?

25:02.421 --> 25:06.048
Maxxie. Where do you think he'll be
in five years' time?

25:06.168 --> 25:08.832
Easy. Dancing in a London show.

25:09.120 --> 25:10.077
Jal?

25:10.197 --> 25:12.718
Playing the clarinet
in some really good orchestra.

25:12.838 --> 25:13.789
Michelle?

25:13.909 --> 25:16.353
Working some slick jobs
in some fine suits.

25:16.528 --> 25:17.791
Now you.

25:19.398 --> 25:21.360
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

25:23.331 --> 25:25.581
Haven't thought about it, have you?

25:25.896 --> 25:28.396
No. I'll be
with my friends, having a laugh.

25:31.403 --> 25:32.403
Somewhere.

25:32.523 --> 25:34.030
But don't you get it?

25:34.150 --> 25:36.319
They've got
their plans, their futures.

25:37.389 --> 25:39.039
And you're not in them.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.618
And you're so much better, are you?
Made any plans, have you?

25:42.738 --> 25:46.127
I'm going to stay here,
and there's nothing wrong with that.

25:48.027 --> 25:50.477
They'll smile every time
you call them,

25:51.027 --> 25:53.638
they'll just take longer
to return your calls.

25:54.356 --> 25:57.729
Being left behind, Anwar,
that's not such a big problem.

25:58.710 --> 26:00.660
You'll just have new friends.

26:03.356 --> 26:04.806
New friends like me.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.600
I am the resurrection

26:43.760 --> 26:44.984
and the life.

26:45.236 --> 26:49.160
He who believeth in me,
though he were dead, sayeth the Lord,

26:49.590 --> 26:50.940
yet he shall live.

26:51.979 --> 26:54.229
Deliver your servant Christopher...

26:55.091 --> 26:58.833
I've been thinking about what Chris
would have wanted me to say today.

26:59.548 --> 27:01.198
The advice he'd give me.

27:02.473 --> 27:04.528
Which would be something like,

27:04.648 --> 27:06.039
"You know what, babe,

27:06.482 --> 27:07.626
"fuck it.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.280
"These guys know all about me.
Tell them about someone different."

27:14.483 --> 27:17.733
So I thought I'd say something
about a hero of Chris's.

27:19.165 --> 27:21.658
A man called captain Joe Katanga.

27:23.485 --> 27:25.205
In 1960,

27:26.001 --> 27:27.951
climbing into a foil balloon,

27:28.966 --> 27:32.632
Captain Joe ascended 32
kilometres into the stratosphere.

27:33.984 --> 27:35.280
And then,

27:35.719 --> 27:38.001
armed only with a parachute,

27:38.948 --> 27:40.419
he jumped out.

27:49.215 --> 27:51.707
He fell for four minutes and
36 seconds,

27:51.827 --> 27:54.120
reaching 740mph

27:54.456 --> 27:58.626
before opening his parachute
five kilometres above the earth.

27:59.290 --> 28:02.808
It had never been done before.
And has never been done since.

28:03.934 --> 28:06.440
He did it just because he could...

28:06.600 --> 28:09.240
- Keep going.
- ... and that's why Chris loved him.

28:09.791 --> 28:13.340
Because the thing about Chris was
he said yes.

28:13.871 --> 28:16.000
He said yes to everything.

28:16.213 --> 28:18.056
He loved everyone.

28:18.466 --> 28:20.688
For ever and ever, Amen.

28:20.808 --> 28:23.258
He was the bravest boy...

28:23.378 --> 28:25.837
man, I knew.

28:28.030 --> 28:29.670
And that was...

28:31.004 --> 28:33.840
He flung himself
out of a foil balloon every day.

28:35.804 --> 28:37.154
Because he could.

28:38.002 --> 28:39.252
Because he was.

28:41.802 --> 28:43.152
And that's why...

28:45.620 --> 28:47.200
and that's why...

28:48.314 --> 28:49.314
We...

28:50.190 --> 28:51.340
We loved him.

28:51.643 --> 28:54.413
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

28:55.392 --> 28:58.986
In sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection, to eternal life.

29:18.631 --> 29:19.879
Who are these people?

29:20.444 --> 29:21.560
Arabs.

29:26.188 --> 29:29.836
Graham, if you would like to
put some soil on the coffin now.

30:04.416 --> 30:06.766
- Toot on that.
- Jal, you all right?

30:07.786 --> 30:09.036
Yeah, I'm fine.

30:23.709 --> 30:25.459
Results o'clock, I think.

30:34.160 --> 30:37.080
Chris would want us to have
a party, a proper blow-out

30:37.241 --> 30:38.360
before you all leave.

30:38.520 --> 30:39.879
But I'm leaving tonight.

30:41.610 --> 30:42.862
Tonight?

30:43.110 --> 30:46.336
Yes. Me and James are on the
late coach to London.

30:47.381 --> 30:48.662
There you go.

30:48.782 --> 30:50.640
We're all busy.

30:50.986 --> 30:53.559
Maybe at Christmas
when we come back, yeah?

30:56.033 --> 30:57.279
Right, then. No peeking.

31:00.112 --> 31:01.112
Tony.

31:10.157 --> 31:11.640
Three A's and a B.

31:12.491 --> 31:14.373
Cardiff it is then.

31:19.182 --> 31:22.799
Yeah, and if anyone gets me a Baa
Baa Fuck Sheep, I'll kill them.

31:23.669 --> 31:24.919
So, who's next?

31:28.050 --> 31:28.880
Sidney.

31:35.552 --> 31:36.700
B, C, C.

31:37.001 --> 31:38.251
Yay, Sidney boy!

31:41.078 --> 31:42.078
Good job.

31:43.670 --> 31:44.520
Maxxie.

31:45.068 --> 31:46.068
Maxxie.

31:50.782 --> 31:51.719
B, E.

31:53.175 --> 31:54.175
B, E.

31:54.768 --> 31:55.818
B.
Not bad.

31:56.968 --> 31:58.560
I be, I be.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.156
Nice one.

32:01.161 --> 32:02.799
Chuck us the bag, Chell.

32:10.954 --> 32:11.954
Jalanda.

32:14.362 --> 32:15.812
It'll be fine, Jal.

32:18.061 --> 32:19.720
Two A's and a C.

32:20.462 --> 32:22.882
- Great stuff.
- Well done, Jal.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.794
Now give it here.

32:29.873 --> 32:31.119
Well done, Jal.

32:35.415 --> 32:36.415
Michelle...

32:45.486 --> 32:46.399
B, A, A.

32:52.469 --> 32:53.656
Well done.

32:54.829 --> 32:57.839
 -Looks like you're off to York.
- Well played, Chelle.

32:58.169 --> 33:00.720
Hang on, still one left.

33:02.224 --> 33:03.426
Anwar.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.439
- Where's he gone?
- He was there a minute ago.

33:07.849 --> 33:08.959
They've been opened.

33:09.379 --> 33:11.933
He'll be fine.
He worked really hard.

33:15.240 --> 33:16.240
Two Es and a U.

33:18.719 --> 33:20.069
How fine is that?

33:36.785 --> 33:39.135
You were right what
you said earlier.

33:39.505 --> 33:40.505
Was I?

33:42.596 --> 33:43.746
totally right.

33:47.293 --> 33:49.771
I never came here
to talk to you about that.

33:49.891 --> 33:50.891
I came...

33:51.708 --> 33:54.401
- I wanted to invite you ice-skating.
- What?

33:54.521 --> 33:57.104
Or to the cinema.
Maybe bowling.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.883
I've never been bowling
before but I might be good, so...

34:01.003 --> 34:03.936
Or we could eat something?
Or do something?

34:10.181 --> 34:11.731
Or we could have sex.

34:12.791 --> 34:14.774
Bristol's our oyster.

34:16.801 --> 34:18.103
Let's just...

34:19.270 --> 34:22.081
Let's just start this life,
shall we, Anwar?

34:37.411 --> 34:40.246
Just handing nibbles
around at the wake.

34:40.367 --> 34:42.234
Said I'd gone to the toilet.

34:46.686 --> 34:48.036
Wasn't good at it,

34:48.373 --> 34:49.523
being his dad.

34:50.949 --> 34:54.617
Some people just aren't built
for parenthood, I guess.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.730
It's used but there's probably
some clean bits.

35:10.441 --> 35:12.678
Sorry... Just...

35:13.040 --> 35:14.640
You sound just like him.

35:15.127 --> 35:16.830
He was my son.

35:22.503 --> 35:26.469
So, I'm guessing, right, that
you were his girlfriend?

35:26.887 --> 35:27.887
Yeah.

35:28.111 --> 35:31.040
Good, you seem like a nice girl.

35:31.200 --> 35:33.150
Yeah, you would have liked me.

35:36.885 --> 35:40.560
Sorry that I didn't
invite you to the... funeral.

35:42.655 --> 35:43.655
Fuck it.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.951
The idea that you cared
enough to ban us all.

35:47.071 --> 35:48.440
He would have liked that.

35:49.494 --> 35:53.161
You fought. For all the
wrong reasons, but you fought.

35:55.168 --> 35:56.353
No...

35:56.806 --> 35:59.520
In some ways, today
couldn't have gone better.

36:21.850 --> 36:24.621
He doesn't want you
to find him, does he?

36:24.741 --> 36:26.008
He's my best friend.

36:26.128 --> 36:27.795
I know but he'll be fine.

36:30.945 --> 36:31.945
Hi.

36:32.913 --> 36:33.839
Hey.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.650
I just...

36:37.598 --> 36:41.165
I just wanted to say goodbye
and good luck.

36:43.030 --> 36:43.880
Thanks.

36:44.529 --> 36:47.799
Listen, it'll be really shit.
We'll find the cheapest rooms

36:47.960 --> 36:50.903
we can and we're going to have no
money for food or booze but...

36:51.023 --> 36:52.890
Fuck it. Why don't you come?

36:53.584 --> 36:54.479
What?

36:55.836 --> 36:56.986
It'll be fun.

36:57.186 --> 36:59.520
And I really want you there.

37:02.331 --> 37:05.274
But aren't I supposed
to be deciding about my future?

37:05.394 --> 37:06.999
Moving on and doing all that?

37:07.161 --> 37:10.319
Fuck the future.
Come to London, have a laugh.

37:15.174 --> 37:17.841
You know I don't have
any pants, right?

37:18.029 --> 37:21.320
No-one wears pants in London.
Come on. We need to roll.

38:20.439 --> 38:21.439
What's that?

38:27.933 --> 38:29.666
It's supposed to be lucky.

38:55.306 --> 38:57.983
So, the three of us

38:59.431 --> 39:00.811
in the car.

39:00.931 --> 39:02.181
Together again.

39:03.134 --> 39:04.134
Yeah.

39:05.762 --> 39:07.956
We've seen each other naked.

39:08.841 --> 39:09.991
Which is nice.

39:15.374 --> 39:17.720
One small question.
Where are we going?

39:18.745 --> 39:19.745
Oh, yeah.

39:23.058 --> 39:24.108
What's this?

39:24.275 --> 39:25.275
Open it.

39:34.148 --> 39:35.148
New York?

39:36.117 --> 39:37.882
Why would I want to go to New York?

39:38.002 --> 39:42.033
She's thin, she's blonde,
she says "Wow" a lot.

39:42.153 --> 39:45.240
It's over, Tone. Me and Cassie
are done. You said so yourself.

39:50.107 --> 39:51.239
Don't look at me.

39:54.013 --> 39:55.263
You'll find her.

39:56.050 --> 39:57.200
You just will.

40:07.234 --> 40:09.272
Right. So...

40:10.471 --> 40:11.761
this is it.

40:12.487 --> 40:13.487
Right.

40:15.811 --> 40:16.811
Good luck.

40:17.523 --> 40:19.275
Right. Yeah.

40:20.475 --> 40:22.480
Thanks for the ticket.

40:55.361 --> 40:56.745
- Tony.
- I know.

40:56.865 --> 40:58.704
But three things, Sid.

40:59.684 --> 41:00.886
One,

41:01.769 --> 41:04.600
get rid of the hat.
It makes you look retarded.

41:08.723 --> 41:09.723
Two...

41:20.318 --> 41:22.359
I always loved you the best, Sid.

41:26.499 --> 41:27.708
Three.

41:32.288 --> 41:33.955
I can't think of a three.

41:39.658 --> 41:42.360
<i>Passenger announcement.
Can all remaining passengers</i>

41:42.520 --> 41:45.967
<i>for flight AZ184 to New York
proceed...</i>

41:46.087 --> 41:47.359
I'll miss my flight.

41:49.306 --> 41:50.306
Yeah.

43:02.710 --> 43:03.710
What if...?

43:07.640 --> 43:08.640
What if?

43:10.690 --> 43:11.690
What if...?

43:17.068 --> 43:18.601
I'm not ready for this.

43:20.958 --> 43:21.958
For what?

43:24.455 --> 43:25.505
All of this.

43:29.398 --> 43:31.198
But you sort of need to be.

43:35.304 --> 43:38.576
You know, the first time I met you,

43:39.517 --> 43:40.520
I knew.

43:42.142 --> 43:43.079
I just

43:43.976 --> 43:46.309
knew I wanted to have sex with you.

43:53.765 --> 43:54.765
Fuck you.

44:01.778 --> 44:03.445
We were good, weren't we?

44:08.955 --> 44:10.622
We were better than that.

45:23.935 --> 45:25.602
Excuse me, my name's Sid.

45:26.750 --> 45:29.083
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

45:29.840 --> 45:33.740
Excuse me. Have you seen...?
Excuse me, really sorry.
