<i>Previously, on</i>
"This Is Us"...

00:07.219 --> 00:08.820
I take office
in the next few weeks,

00:08.915 --> 00:10.319
and God only knows
what kind of effect

00:10.406 --> 00:11.827
that's gonna have
on my family.

00:11.915 --> 00:13.374
We're moving to Philadelphia.

00:13.484 --> 00:15.687
This is my friend Deja.

00:16.030 --> 00:18.421
Hi, hi, hi, Deja.
Um, Malik.

00:18.556 --> 00:19.874
Nice to meet you.

00:21.282 --> 00:23.171
I think I might like girls.

00:23.572 --> 00:24.788
We love you.

00:25.312 --> 00:27.041
No matter what, okay?

00:27.835 --> 00:29.041
Hello?

00:29.359 --> 00:30.912
All right, um,

00:31.054 --> 00:32.192
hold on one second.

00:32.281 --> 00:33.506
It's Uncle Nicky.
He got in trouble

00:33.593 --> 00:35.007
<i>in Pennsylvania.
He's being arrested</i>

00:35.129 --> 00:36.960
<i>and he gave them my number
for the bail money.</i>

00:37.048 --> 00:39.724

Happy end
of summer vacation,

00:55.462 --> 00:57.593
- Ah.
- Babe. Thank you.

00:57.681 --> 00:59.491
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:00.370 --> 01:01.412
Next week,

01:01.577 --> 01:03.513
those irritable
prepubescent monsters

01:03.601 --> 01:05.227
are no longer our problem
between the hours

01:05.313 --> 01:07.812
- of 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
- Ugh. Right?

01:07.900 --> 01:11.116
- Hmm...
- Mmm, I actually hated that high five.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.343
Me, too.

01:12.624 --> 01:15.265
Hey, babe, can we please
just do something fun today?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.274
I feel like we haven't even seen
the kids all summer.

01:17.361 --> 01:19.757
Yeah, that's because they're
going into seventh grade.

01:19.837 --> 01:21.750
They want nothing
to do with us anymore.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.812
You know, they actually think
we're dorks.

01:24.437 --> 01:25.960
Like, me, a dork.

01:26.048 --> 01:27.942
- I know.
- Me.

01:28.158 --> 01:29.257
Okay.

01:30.312 --> 01:33.101
Hey, kids?
Get in here!

01:33.234 --> 01:35.288
Hey, why don't we go
to the pool?

01:35.564 --> 01:37.567
We haven't been to the pool
in forever.

01:37.654 --> 01:39.211
Well, I could do,
I could do a pool day.

01:39.298 --> 01:40.648
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:42.122 --> 01:44.507
- Good morning.
- Hey, you two, eyes up here.

01:44.595 --> 01:45.937
- Take those off for a second.
- Hey!

01:46.024 --> 01:49.023
Hey yourself.
Exciting announcement:

01:49.198 --> 01:50.708
we're doing a Pearson family
fun day.

01:50.796 --> 01:52.296
We're gonna go
to the Greenview pool.

01:52.397 --> 01:53.702
Do we have to?

01:53.790 --> 01:56.007
There's a 90210 marathon on.

01:56.095 --> 01:57.484
Yeah, I'm good to stay here.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.625
I want to knock out two more
books to make sure that I win

01:59.712 --> 02:01.968
this summer's library
read-a-thon.

02:04.844 --> 02:06.320
Can we go
to the Greenview pool?

02:06.408 --> 02:08.756
- Please.
- You big mope, don't hold out on us.

02:08.844 --> 02:10.485
- Please. Please.
- Please.

02:10.573 --> 02:12.464
Okay.

02:15.003 --> 02:16.585
Hey, Nicky, it's Kevin,

02:16.673 --> 02:18.021
uh, again.

02:18.398 --> 02:20.763
Listen, I-I left you,
like, five voice mails, man.

02:20.851 --> 02:22.836
Um, I'm just trying to make sure
you're okay.

02:22.923 --> 02:25.546
And I-I know you texted me last week
saying that you were okay,

02:25.634 --> 02:27.139
which was a little urprising,
actually,

02:27.226 --> 02:29.562
'cause I didn't realize texting
was in your wheelhouse.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.374
But, um...

02:32.238 --> 02:33.404
Listen, man, I guess I'm looking

02:33.491 --> 02:34.657
for a little more detail,
you know?

02:34.744 --> 02:37.706
Uh, seeing as I did wire you
all that money for bail.

02:37.820 --> 02:39.413
So...

02:39.883 --> 02:41.756
Would you please call me
back?

02:42.147 --> 02:44.109
Just want to make sure
you're okay.

02:45.484 --> 02:47.070
Bye.

02:52.015 --> 02:56.188
So, good news: my houseplant
finally grew a new branch.

02:56.477 --> 02:59.467
So... which, for those of you
who aren't regulars here,

02:59.555 --> 03:03.068
uh, my sponsor suggested
that I get something simple

03:03.156 --> 03:04.045
to take care of.

03:04.133 --> 03:05.930
Said it would keep me
focused.

03:06.164 --> 03:07.847
So I got a ficus.

03:08.265 --> 03:10.688
A Ficus benjamina, to be exact.

03:11.016 --> 03:13.320
And good on my sponsor,
because that plant

03:13.408 --> 03:15.154
is basically the only thing
in my life

03:15.242 --> 03:17.235
that I feel in control of
right now.

03:19.546 --> 03:20.690
Yeah?

03:20.778 --> 03:22.800
- Ready for you, Kevin.
- Okay.

03:24.313 --> 03:26.225
<i>I've been just sort
of going through the motions</i>

03:26.313 --> 03:28.563
<i>on this new movie
that I just finished.</i>

03:28.823 --> 03:30.610
All right, Kev.
Last take.

03:30.698 --> 03:32.131
Mind if we try
something different?

03:32.219 --> 03:33.928
You just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

03:34.016 --> 03:35.304
<i>All right,
don't let this guy hide.</i>

03:35.391 --> 03:37.817
<i>He's alone. Let him not be okay
for a second.</i>

03:37.904 --> 03:38.976
- Sound good?
- Great idea.

03:39.063 --> 03:40.976
Okay, all right, here we go.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.893
Everybody to one.
Let's go.

03:44.003 --> 03:44.967
Set!

03:45.054 --> 03:46.976
- And... background.
- Background.

03:47.063 --> 03:50.844
- Action!
- Go, guys, go, cops.

04:03.596 --> 04:04.757
And cut.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.558
- Fantastic.
- That's a cut!

04:06.646 --> 04:07.706
Great.

04:09.587 --> 04:12.061
- Hey, man.
- Hi. Thanks for the opportunity.

04:12.149 --> 04:13.664
I really appreciate it.
That was fun.

04:13.752 --> 04:15.187
And, uh, thanks
for being a good sport

04:15.274 --> 04:16.846
about all
the "I see dead people" jokes.

04:16.933 --> 04:18.170
Yeah, that never gets old.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.351
- I bet.
- Yeah.

04:19.735 --> 04:20.815
All right.

04:20.904 --> 04:22.688
- You know, when... Sit down.
- Yeah.

04:22.776 --> 04:24.820
You know, when you strip away
all the artifice,

04:24.913 --> 04:27.967
all those tricks you use
to make yourself seem

04:28.055 --> 04:30.857
appealing and charming
and handsome...

04:31.047 --> 04:32.860
When you let all that crap go,

04:33.344 --> 04:35.805
you're absolutely
incredible.

04:39.668 --> 04:41.398
And I am...

04:43.399 --> 04:45.602
..way in over my head
with my sister

04:45.690 --> 04:47.115
and her new son.

04:47.701 --> 04:49.107
<i>He was born premature,</i>

04:49.195 --> 04:51.884
<i>and we just found out
that he's blind.</i>

04:56.844 --> 04:58.712
<i>So I go to all the doctor's
appointments with them,</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.672
<i>but I never know
what to say.</i>

05:01.195 --> 05:03.177
<i>I never know what to do.</i>

05:03.844 --> 05:04.917
So...

05:05.623 --> 05:07.024
there's that.

05:14.318 --> 05:15.350
Hey.

05:15.998 --> 05:17.316
Just saw
the new windows going in

05:17.404 --> 05:18.817
over at the community center.

05:18.904 --> 05:20.131
Yeah.

05:21.084 --> 05:23.551
Got some real nice
double-paned beauties.

05:23.639 --> 05:26.857
Almost as beautiful as
my wife.

05:26.944 --> 05:29.363
Did you just compare me
to rec center windows?

05:29.451 --> 05:30.933
They're double-paned windows.

05:31.021 --> 05:33.123
It's the sexiest kind
of windows.

05:33.341 --> 05:35.806
- Okay. All right.
- All right, all right.

05:35.894 --> 05:37.054
So these are
the paint options

05:37.141 --> 05:38.247
- for my dance studio.
- Mm.

05:38.334 --> 05:40.847
- Right? Which one do you like?
- Hmm.

05:41.045 --> 05:42.568
Silver Whisper,
of course.

05:42.656 --> 05:44.285
But no studio today.

05:44.373 --> 05:45.443
I got big things planned

05:45.531 --> 05:47.310
for the last day
of summer break.

05:47.398 --> 05:48.866
Everybody's been
so busy getting

05:48.922 --> 05:50.394
settled in
these past few weeks,

05:50.592 --> 05:51.949
so I'm thinking

05:52.037 --> 05:54.371
a classic Pearson
family fun day.

05:54.459 --> 05:55.807
I'm down.

05:55.894 --> 05:58.230
But good luck
getting these girls on board.

05:58.318 --> 05:59.826
I don't know
if it's the hormones

05:59.913 --> 06:01.239
or the stress
of going to new schools,

06:01.326 --> 06:03.877
but they are definitely
getting meaner by the day.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.766
Stop it. They are not
getting meaner by...

06:05.853 --> 06:07.183
Hey! There they are.

06:07.271 --> 06:09.121
The flyest females in Philly.

06:09.209 --> 06:11.757
You don't need to give us
nicknames every morning.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.489
No, sometimes,
you could just be like,

06:13.740 --> 06:16.537
"Good morning, Tess.
Good morning, Deja."

06:17.068 --> 06:18.917
- Meaner by the day.
- Mom,

06:19.004 --> 06:20.776
can you take me
to get my hair cut?

06:20.863 --> 06:22.050
Yeah, I would,

06:22.138 --> 06:24.027
but your dad has a classic

06:24.115 --> 06:26.766
- Pearson family fun day planned.
- Ooh!

06:26.853 --> 06:27.779
It's gonna be epic.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.404
I'm talking Liberty Bell.

06:29.492 --> 06:31.584
I'm talking gorging
on cheesesteaks

06:31.683 --> 06:33.043
- till you get meat sweats.
- Mmm!

06:33.131 --> 06:36.191
Mom promised that I can get my
hair cut before school starts.

06:36.279 --> 06:37.973
That's why I've been
growing it out all summer.

06:38.060 --> 06:39.027
And you promised me

06:39.115 --> 06:41.098
that we could ride the bus
together so you could decide

06:41.185 --> 06:42.817
if I can take it to school
by myself.

06:42.904 --> 06:44.097
Even though

06:44.185 --> 06:45.817
I've been taking the bus
by myself

06:45.904 --> 06:47.732
since I was eight years old.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.308
All right.
All right, how about this?

06:50.396 --> 06:52.896
Dej, you and I
will do a trial run

06:52.983 --> 06:54.472
of the bus route to school.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.652
Beth, you take Tess
to the salon.

06:56.740 --> 06:58.036
And then we'll meet up
for a classic

06:58.123 --> 07:00.966
- Pearson family fun afternoon.
- Ooh.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.886
Unless something horrible
happens on the bus.

07:02.973 --> 07:04.787
- Ooh.
- Would you stop? Do you hear this?

07:05.562 --> 07:07.060
Annie, my favorite child,

07:07.148 --> 07:08.561
is there anything
that you'd like to do today?

07:08.648 --> 07:10.187
I'm good with whatever.

07:10.528 --> 07:11.617
Bless your soul.

07:25.338 --> 07:26.282
Yes.

07:26.370 --> 07:28.762
Is he done? 'Cause I got
to squish that little face.

07:28.850 --> 07:29.893
Yes, he is.

07:29.981 --> 07:31.153
Okay, Jack,

- Aw.
- Hey, buddy. It's me, your dad.

07:47.242 --> 07:51.574
All you have to remember
is that I am the hairy one.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.606
Huh?
There... Yeah, see?

07:54.777 --> 07:56.231
There it is.

07:57.208 --> 08:00.177
Now...
how are you feeling?

08:00.421 --> 08:01.692
- Good.
- About today?

08:01.780 --> 08:03.005
Yeah, I'm excited.

08:03.326 --> 08:06.417
I mean, according to Dr. Dorsey,
this woman is amazing.

08:06.506 --> 08:08.338
And Yelp.

08:08.699 --> 08:09.763
There are specialists

08:09.851 --> 08:13.185
who teach you how to raise
a blind baby on Yelp?

08:13.340 --> 08:15.183
Oh, there's everything on Yelp.

08:15.333 --> 08:16.614
But I cannot wait to learn

08:16.702 --> 08:18.536
- some pro tips. I need 'em.
- Yeah.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.403
- Right, Baby Jack?
- Yeah.

08:20.491 --> 08:22.942
Can you feel Mommy smiling?

08:23.030 --> 08:25.685
She's so excited
to learn pro tips.

08:25.773 --> 08:27.536
She's so excited.

08:28.981 --> 08:31.153
What?
Why are you looking at me like that?

08:31.638 --> 08:33.302
Uh...
A week ago, we found out

08:33.390 --> 08:35.871
that there is nothing we can do
about his vision,

08:35.960 --> 08:39.513
and you haven't missed a beat.

08:39.746 --> 08:41.895
Now, don't get me wrong.
That... I think that's awesome.

08:41.982 --> 08:44.575
I'm just...
I'm just checking in.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.247
- That's all.
- I'm so good.

08:46.335 --> 08:47.364
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:47.452 --> 08:48.600
And I appreciate it.
Thank you.

08:48.687 --> 08:50.442
- Okay.
- Thank you. How are you feeling?

08:50.608 --> 08:53.731
Uh... I'm hanging
in there, I guess.

08:53.819 --> 08:56.481
- Good. Good.
- All right.

08:56.569 --> 08:58.083
- Okay.
- Okay.

Five chairs.

10:12.271 --> 10:14.022

- Nice.

10:14.765 --> 10:16.600
Keith, Renard,
you guys made it.

10:16.688 --> 10:19.091
Come on, we're going
to get Firecracker pops.

10:19.516 --> 10:20.702
What are you listening to?

10:20.786 --> 10:21.803
Wreckx-n-Effect.

10:21.891 --> 10:23.152
Oh, cool.
We brought our boombox.

10:23.239 --> 10:25.130
- You want to put it on?
- Sure.

10:26.101 --> 10:27.823
Hey. Hey, g... I...

10:27.910 --> 10:29.966
- I got five chairs, guys.
- Hey, Bug,

10:30.216 --> 10:31.685
do you want to go play a game?

10:31.773 --> 10:33.216
Mom, stop talking right now.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.315
Hey, Carrie.
Hey, Jessica P.

10:36.403 --> 10:39.302
- Cool cover-up.
- Oh, thanks.

10:39.474 --> 10:41.677
- Want to come hang out with us?
- Sure.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.669
Hey, Katie girl,

10:43.757 --> 10:45.670
- I-I got five chairs.
- Uh...

10:46.695 --> 10:48.437
Do you know who that is?

10:48.552 --> 10:50.607
Carrie and Jessica P.?

10:50.695 --> 10:53.159
Yeah, the most popular girls
in school.

10:53.247 --> 10:54.245
I don't think they've ever

10:54.333 --> 10:56.294
talked to Kate
a day in her life.

10:56.382 --> 10:58.708
Come on, you heard them,
they-they like her cover-up.

10:58.796 --> 11:00.982
Yeah. I don't trust that.

11:01.341 --> 11:02.638
Hey, babe?

11:02.726 --> 11:04.191
- Hmm?
- You know, there is an upside...

11:04.278 --> 11:05.364
Why don't you lay back...

11:05.452 --> 11:08.542
To kids that want
nothing to do with us. Ah.

11:15.754 --> 11:17.489
- Hey, Kev.
- Yeah?

11:17.653 --> 11:20.647
If your uncle wants to talk,
he knows how to find you.

11:20.735 --> 11:21.687
Right.

11:21.775 --> 11:23.903
I... I think that you should be

11:23.991 --> 11:26.067
staying focused
on your sobriety.

11:26.192 --> 11:28.560
Working and keeping busy has
been a really good thing

11:28.648 --> 11:31.081
for you, maybe you should try
looking for your next job.

11:31.169 --> 11:32.880
Yeah, maybe.

11:33.590 --> 11:36.245
Now, we did read
in The Hollywood Reporter

11:36.333 --> 11:37.917
that you're on some short list

11:38.005 --> 11:40.575
for that new movie
with, um... What's...

11:40.708 --> 11:42.269
- Uh, Spike Jonze.
- Spike Jonze.

11:42.388 --> 11:44.104
Okay, hold on a second,
you two are reading

11:44.192 --> 11:45.050
The Hollywood Reporter?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.332
Oh, yeah, we got a subscription

11:46.419 --> 11:47.762
- when we moved here.
- Wow,

11:47.850 --> 11:49.012
that's terrifying.
Yeah.

11:49.100 --> 11:51.698
Anyway, um, the movie shoots
in Chicago, right,

11:51.786 --> 11:53.666
so I'd have to leave,
then I'm thinking

11:53.754 --> 11:55.300
it might be best for me
to just stay here and

11:55.387 --> 11:56.843
- help Kate with the baby, you know?
- Yeah, I...

11:56.930 --> 11:58.841
I just think it would be good
for you to stay busy,

11:58.928 --> 12:01.809
is all I'm saying.
All right,

12:02.028 --> 12:03.105
- are we ready for this?
- Yeah.

12:03.192 --> 12:05.098
- Yeah.
- All right. Here we come.

12:06.237 --> 12:07.260
Hello?

12:07.348 --> 12:08.276
Hi.

12:08.364 --> 12:11.843
- Hi.
- There's my grandson.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.833
Hi. - Hi. -Hey.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.843
- There you go.
- Wow. This place is really

12:15.930 --> 12:16.834
- coming together.
- Thank you. -Yeah.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.843
- Yeah, yeah.
- Hey, Toby, every time

12:18.930 --> 12:21.200
I see you,
I-I swear you're skinnier.

12:21.288 --> 12:23.334
Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

12:23.422 --> 12:25.278
You doing paleo or aikido or,

12:25.366 --> 12:27.004
yeah, are you
intermittent fasting?

12:27.091 --> 12:29.108
More like, uh,
intermittent stressing.

12:29.202 --> 12:31.068
You know, what-what you do is,
for 22 hours a day,

12:31.155 --> 12:33.051
you stress, uh, uh,
over your baby,

12:33.139 --> 12:34.507
and you stress
about your mortgage, and then,

12:34.594 --> 12:36.348
you just sleep
for the other two hours.

12:36.436 --> 12:38.817
- Hmm.
- Yeah, the weight just falls off.

12:38.905 --> 12:40.803
Too bad
it doesn't work for me.

12:41.045 --> 12:44.184
I keep telling you,
you have to stress harder.

12:44.272 --> 12:46.059
Ooh, I think that's Anna.

12:46.147 --> 12:47.702
Come on.
Let's all go wash our hands.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.013
- Yeah. - Oh, hey.
- Hey.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.854
- Hey.
- How are you doing?

12:50.941 --> 12:52.803
Good. Madison,
please don't do the voice.

12:52.890 --> 12:54.147
- Okay.
- Listen,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.813
I... I'm great, Jack is great.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.974
Today, we're just gonna
keep things very light.

12:59.099 --> 13:00.973
- Right? And positive.
- Okay. Okay.

13:01.061 --> 13:02.894
- Okay.
- I am... I am so your girl.

13:03.038 --> 13:04.780
I was head cheerleader
in high school,

13:04.868 --> 13:06.293
and I was one
of those bar mitzvah

13:06.381 --> 13:07.725
party starters in college.

13:07.813 --> 13:10.194
If there's anyone
who can keep things peppy,

13:10.413 --> 13:11.894
you're looking at her.

13:11.981 --> 13:13.780
I know you guys have been
through a lot

13:13.868 --> 13:15.750
over the last couple months, but

13:15.838 --> 13:18.569
today is about the next chapter.

13:18.657 --> 13:21.599
Today, we're going to go over
the basics of how to care

13:21.687 --> 13:23.678
for your blind infant,
to make sure

13:23.766 --> 13:27.246
he has everything he needs
physically and developmentally.

13:27.334 --> 13:29.748
Great. Great. Right?

13:29.911 --> 13:31.772
We're so eager to learn.

13:32.779 --> 13:35.612
What? Oh, you want
to take notes, Jack?

13:35.863 --> 13:36.805
Oh.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.035
He wants us to take the notes.
He's just gonna listen.

13:39.123 --> 13:41.389
He's just gonna listen, right?

13:41.684 --> 13:44.452
Ha! Too funny.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.097
Okay.

13:46.185 --> 13:48.332
Uh, so, first question.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.528
- I know this is a new house.
- Mm.

13:50.616 --> 13:52.160
Are you happy
with the furniture

13:52.248 --> 13:54.202
- and where everything is?
- Uh...

13:54.342 --> 13:56.483
Why? Are you
an interior designer, too?

13:56.571 --> 13:58.592
I ask
because Jack is already starting

13:58.680 --> 14:00.602
to absorb the layout
of the new home.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.373
So, if the furniture stays put,

14:02.461 --> 14:05.106
then it makes it easier
for him to learn each room.

14:05.194 --> 14:07.489
- Mm.
- Different floor textures help, too.

14:07.577 --> 14:10.725
Uh, carpeting in one room,
tile in the next.

14:11.577 --> 14:12.984
That's smart.

14:13.569 --> 14:16.784
Okay, so, I'd like
to start with an activity.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.943
We will all take a notepad,
choose a room, and write down

14:20.030 --> 14:22.655
anything you think
might be dangerous

14:22.771 --> 14:26.069
or of concern to Baby Jack
once he starts to crawl.

14:30.786 --> 14:32.506
What are we doing for you today?

14:32.594 --> 14:35.285
I was thinking
something like this.

14:35.373 --> 14:38.248
Oh, bold! I love it!

14:38.538 --> 14:40.834
Here. Let me clean up my station,
and I'll come grab you?

14:42.256 --> 14:43.631
Hey.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.467
Are you sure about this?

14:45.702 --> 14:46.922
Yup.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.689
Okay.

14:49.012 --> 14:50.577
As long as you're sure.

14:51.069 --> 14:52.793
I mean, I-I want you
to express yourself,

14:52.880 --> 14:56.121
you know, I really do, but this is...
this is a big decision.

14:56.209 --> 14:59.600
I know, which is why you've made
me think about this all summer.

15:00.865 --> 15:02.490
Can you just...?

15:07.444 --> 15:08.986
So, this is what a bus is like.

15:09.514 --> 15:11.803
I've been on a bus before, Dej.

15:12.061 --> 15:13.785
I know this is important to you.

15:13.873 --> 15:14.923
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around it.

15:15.010 --> 15:17.270
- So, humor me here, okay?
- Okay.

15:17.358 --> 15:19.207
Well, how about
we don't sit together

15:19.295 --> 15:22.803
so you can see what it'll really
be like for me riding it alone?

15:23.927 --> 15:25.182
It's a good idea.

15:25.270 --> 15:27.213
Mm-hmm.

15:37.025 --> 15:38.954
<i>I told you all the good stuff.</i>

15:40.664 --> 15:42.000
<i>I told you all the good stuff.</i>

15:42.088 --> 15:45.354
<i>I told you
all the good stuff, Grayson.</i>

15:55.526 --> 15:56.940
People get buried
in their phones.

15:57.061 --> 15:58.923
When I was growing up,

15:59.010 --> 16:00.943
if you weren't home,
they didn't get a hold of you.

16:01.030 --> 16:02.854
Frankly, I think people
get a hold of you

16:02.941 --> 16:04.823
too easily nowadays.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.276
I'd like to disappear
every now and then.

16:11.364 --> 16:14.181
Excuse me.
Can I sit next to my daughter?

16:14.820 --> 16:16.982
Yeah. All right.

16:23.601 --> 16:25.527
What was he talking to you
about?

16:25.636 --> 16:28.941
The Democratic primary.
I don't know.

16:29.708 --> 16:32.206
Randall, he was a weirdo.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.013
The bus is full of weirdos.

16:34.101 --> 16:36.991
But I can handle myself.

16:40.371 --> 16:42.923
Why do you even care
about riding the bus so much?

16:43.011 --> 16:44.376
It's faster if I drive you.

16:44.464 --> 16:45.941
You moved us here.

16:46.152 --> 16:48.173
You wanted me
to live in Philadelphia,

16:48.261 --> 16:49.793
so let me live in Philadelphia.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.392
I am letting you live, Deja,
but I am also your father.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.904
Okay, you're right,

16:54.991 --> 16:58.652
but I also had a whole life
before I met you.

16:58.740 --> 17:01.733
We grew up real different,
Randall.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.251
The stuff
that makes you uncomfortable

17:04.339 --> 17:05.954
reminds me
of where I'm from.

17:06.332 --> 17:07.914
I get it.

17:08.433 --> 17:11.377
But it is my job
to worry about you.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.463
And you're only in
the ninth grade, and I'm just

17:13.550 --> 17:16.833
not comfortable with it yet,
so maybe next year, okay?

17:18.095 --> 17:19.837
Unbelievable.

17:28.789 --> 17:30.689
M.C. Hammer is mad old.

17:30.777 --> 17:32.257
Okay, I got one.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.703
Which member of Kris Kross
do y'all think is cooler?

17:34.976 --> 17:36.179
Definitely Kross.

17:36.321 --> 17:38.523
Neither of them
are named "Kross," Randall.

17:39.001 --> 17:41.583
I know.
I was making a joke.

17:41.671 --> 17:43.789

18:39.420 --> 18:40.732
I don't know what that is.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.828
- Hey, is that your mom?
- Hi, ladies.

18:43.916 --> 18:45.601
How are you?

18:47.385 --> 18:48.898
Hi!

18:49.102 --> 18:51.062
I just... I wanted
to see if maybe

18:51.150 --> 18:52.789
you wanted to go swimming
with Dad and I?

18:52.877 --> 18:54.422
Or play a little Marco Polo?

18:54.510 --> 18:56.132
Um, I'm gonna stay here.

18:56.220 --> 19:00.119
Okay.
Hey, Bug, um...

19:01.852 --> 19:05.078
Have those girls ever wanted to
hang out with you before today?

19:05.562 --> 19:08.763
I mean, I just want to make sure
that you're having fun, and...

19:08.851 --> 19:11.420
Can you just go back
to Dad, please?

19:22.354 --> 19:23.976
Yes.

19:30.290 --> 19:31.734
You are looking very trim, Toby.

19:31.823 --> 19:33.881
Yeah. Breastfeeding.

19:33.969 --> 19:34.995
Burns calories.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.915
- Ah.
- Yeah.

19:37.987 --> 19:39.945
How are you holding up?

19:41.256 --> 19:42.765
Honestly?

19:43.608 --> 19:44.906
Hanging on by a thread.

19:44.994 --> 19:46.068
Yeah.

19:46.156 --> 19:48.544
I have... I've just...
I've never worried

19:48.632 --> 19:50.372
about so many things
all at once.

19:50.695 --> 19:53.399
Is one of those things Kate?

19:55.554 --> 19:58.349
You know, a few months ago...

20:00.869 --> 20:04.070
...when we found out
that, uh, something was wrong,

20:04.875 --> 20:07.351
I remember
the new eye doctor coming in

20:07.460 --> 20:11.929
and telling us that...
Jack wasn't responding

20:12.017 --> 20:13.890
- to visual cues.
- Mm.

20:13.978 --> 20:17.531
I remember him saying the word
"retina."

20:17.761 --> 20:20.367
And then,
everything just kind of went,

20:20.460 --> 20:22.132
"Wah-wah, wah-wah,
wah-wah."

20:22.220 --> 20:25.726
You know, Charlie Brown's
mother, just noise.

20:26.055 --> 20:27.718
And I look over,

20:27.806 --> 20:32.365
and Kate is sitting up
real straight.

20:32.453 --> 20:33.905
- Mm-hmm.
- You know, like when she...

20:33.992 --> 20:35.609
when she really locks in
on something,

20:35.697 --> 20:37.818
and she is nodding.

20:40.343 --> 20:43.828
My amazing wife just...
nodding her head

20:43.916 --> 20:47.421
as if someone is giving her
a bad weather report.

20:50.445 --> 20:52.257
And she's, uh...

20:53.500 --> 20:57.078
She has been that way
every single day since.

20:59.193 --> 21:02.109
You know, just steady.

21:05.679 --> 21:08.328
To be honest,
I'm kind of in awe of her.

21:10.562 --> 21:13.406
So I shouldn't be concerned?

21:15.140 --> 21:17.343
She's overeating, Rebecca.

21:19.039 --> 21:21.546
And I know that
that is just a way of...

21:21.634 --> 21:24.093
dealing with difficult emotions.

21:24.599 --> 21:29.183
But of all of the things that
I am worried about right now...

21:30.083 --> 21:31.976
she's at the top of my list.

21:33.339 --> 21:34.804
You know?

21:48.514 --> 21:49.675
I know.

21:51.523 --> 21:53.412
Yeah, I do know.

22:06.431 --> 22:07.767
Hey, pretty lady.

22:07.855 --> 22:09.189
What you sitting out here for?

22:09.277 --> 22:11.814
Oh. Hey, guys.
How was the...

22:12.239 --> 22:13.517
bus?

22:13.629 --> 22:15.743
I was gonna say,
"How was the bus?"

22:15.831 --> 22:17.024
Yeah.

22:17.441 --> 22:19.001
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here

22:19.089 --> 22:21.204
and say the bus ride
did not go well.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.454
A man sat next to her,

22:23.542 --> 22:25.196
I freaked out
and forbade the bus.

22:25.284 --> 22:26.384
- Oh.
- So...

22:26.471 --> 22:29.064
Deja's not too thrilled with me.

22:30.742 --> 22:32.575
I'm gonna go out
on that same limb

22:32.663 --> 22:35.032
and say that the haircut
didn't go so great, either.

22:35.351 --> 22:37.361
- It did not.
- Mm.

22:40.502 --> 22:43.767
She's just gonna look
so different, you know?

22:44.369 --> 22:46.282
My little girl.

22:46.502 --> 22:48.173
I love her hair.

22:48.287 --> 22:50.704
I love when people say
that we look alike.

22:51.517 --> 22:53.993
But, I don't know,
first it's the new haircut,

22:54.081 --> 22:55.899
and then it's clothes, and...

22:55.993 --> 22:59.009
before long the little girl
I knew like the back of my hand

22:59.097 --> 23:00.876
is someone completely new,

23:00.964 --> 23:04.134
and it just...
makes me so sad.

23:04.688 --> 23:06.931
They're changing so fast.

23:07.876 --> 23:10.142
I remember
when I was their age.

23:15.451 --> 23:18.060
There was so much going on
in my brain.

23:18.502 --> 23:22.381
And I'm talking real,
complicated adult stuff.

23:29.851 --> 23:32.985
I hope moving to Philadelphia
was a good idea.

23:34.260 --> 23:35.990
I know it's gonna be.

23:36.334 --> 23:37.515
Hey, guys.

23:42.029 --> 23:45.019
I-I know it's really different.

23:46.952 --> 23:50.154
You know, I couldn't...
really picture it before,

23:50.242 --> 23:52.206
but now that I see it...

23:52.724 --> 23:54.818
baby, you never looked
more beautiful.

23:55.179 --> 23:56.677
Really?

23:56.765 --> 23:58.193
I love it.

23:58.674 --> 24:01.076
- I love it.
- Me, too.

24:01.438 --> 24:03.933
All right, come on,
we gotta get

24:04.021 --> 24:07.419
our classic Pearson
family fun afternoon on.

24:07.815 --> 24:09.951
All day today!

24:12.943 --> 24:14.998
Hey! You ruined it!

24:15.101 --> 24:16.684
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

24:16.771 --> 24:18.374
- That's why!
- No!

24:20.474 --> 24:22.193
- I'm not!
- Hey! - Yes, you are!

24:22.281 --> 24:23.522
- No, I'm not!
- Hey, stop! Stop!

24:23.609 --> 24:25.404
Both of you, stop!

24:25.583 --> 24:27.927
- What's going on, huh?
- Nothing.

24:28.985 --> 24:30.738
Nothing?

24:30.888 --> 24:32.951
We were just roughhousing.

24:35.684 --> 24:37.226
- So you're good?
- Yeah.

24:37.413 --> 24:38.878
Yeah, we're fine.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.201
All right.

24:53.849 --> 24:55.897
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends,

24:55.985 --> 24:57.389
and you liked doing it.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.966
You're supposed to be
my brother.

25:19.975 --> 25:21.545
Hey. What's up?

25:24.083 --> 25:25.840
Oh, they want to meet with me?

25:26.044 --> 25:28.037
Oh, well, that's great.
That's great.

25:28.125 --> 25:31.145
Tomorrow?
Uh, well, tomorrow,

25:31.233 --> 25:33.372
that means I'd have to get
on a flight tonight.

25:34.573 --> 25:35.577
Uh...

25:36.532 --> 25:38.614
just let me think about it,
okay?

25:39.410 --> 25:40.794
Thank you.

25:51.029 --> 25:54.084
...53 sharp corners
and four electric cords.

25:54.172 --> 25:54.849
Mm.

25:54.937 --> 25:57.729
♪ And two turtledoves... ♪

25:58.411 --> 26:01.193
And a partridge in...
a pear tree, hmm?

26:01.281 --> 26:02.365
Okay.

26:03.200 --> 26:05.964
Any hanging cords
that a baby can pull down,

26:06.052 --> 26:07.575
we also want to avoid.

26:07.747 --> 26:10.021
Yeah, we are all over
the electrical cords.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.208
And we have someone coming
to, uh,

26:12.297 --> 26:13.935
wall-mount that bad boy
next week.

26:14.023 --> 26:15.521
I know we splurged a little.

26:15.609 --> 26:17.138
We just wanted a great TV.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.927
You know, have little Jack

26:19.015 --> 26:21.226
starting to watch the Steelers
really young.

26:26.107 --> 26:27.651
Yeah, and you'll
just explain to him

26:27.739 --> 26:30.425
everything that's happening...
like you did with me.

26:30.512 --> 26:33.450
Absolutely. Absolutely.

26:34.602 --> 26:36.005
Mm-hmm.

26:36.101 --> 26:38.474
Yeah, I'll just, uh,
narrate, and then he'll...

26:38.868 --> 26:40.224
understand.

26:43.793 --> 26:46.880
I'm sorry. I promised myself
that I wouldn't do this.

26:46.976 --> 26:48.256
- It's okay.
- Oh, I'm really sorry.

26:48.343 --> 26:49.747
Just give me a second.

26:49.864 --> 26:51.314
Please don't follow me.

26:51.461 --> 26:53.431
Okay.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.644
Hey.

27:21.521 --> 27:22.994
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

27:23.082 --> 27:24.890
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay. Look, it's...

27:25.332 --> 27:28.946
Relax, man, I'm trying
to have a moment with you, okay?

27:36.490 --> 27:38.451
Am I a good person?

27:41.677 --> 27:44.371
You know you're
187 days old today, Jack.

27:44.459 --> 27:46.808
So, you know,
it's pretty important.

27:47.078 --> 27:49.061
You know
how I know that?

27:49.477 --> 27:53.769
Because I am
187 days sober today.

27:56.284 --> 27:57.804
Which...

27:58.774 --> 28:01.399
seems like an absolute eternity
when you're trying not to drink,

28:01.486 --> 28:02.715
but I look at you, and...

28:02.808 --> 28:04.793
it doesn't seem
like any time at all.

28:04.935 --> 28:06.447
You're so...

28:07.450 --> 28:09.132
new.

28:10.193 --> 28:11.937
Not me.

28:15.111 --> 28:17.285
I'm a year away from 40...

28:17.954 --> 28:20.580
40 years old, and the most
successful relationship

28:20.668 --> 28:23.556
I have in my life is
with a frickin' house plant.

28:24.161 --> 28:27.480
Yeah, of course I think
you're a good person, Kev.

28:28.269 --> 28:29.894
Why?

28:30.368 --> 28:32.398
I do so many bad things.

28:44.697 --> 28:45.697
Look...

28:46.092 --> 28:47.592
you and me...

28:48.277 --> 28:50.902
we come from a long line
of Pearson men

28:50.990 --> 28:54.222
who've got a lot of...
mixed-up stuff

28:54.310 --> 28:56.324
inside of us.

28:57.676 --> 28:59.855
I should just take
that movie in Chicago.

28:59.943 --> 29:02.980
Just take another movie,
you know, stay busy.

29:03.822 --> 29:05.129
Focus on being clean.

29:05.217 --> 29:06.558
That's...

29:07.437 --> 29:09.238
the important thing.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.658
And it's much easier on set,
anyway.

29:11.746 --> 29:14.500
I mean, the director tells me
to do something, and I do it.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.524
He says, "Smile," and I smile.

29:18.313 --> 29:19.938
He says, "Laugh," and I laugh.

29:20.026 --> 29:21.790
He says, "Cry," and I cry.

29:21.878 --> 29:25.029
And then he yells, "Cut!" and...

29:32.019 --> 29:34.056
..and it's just me again.

29:37.879 --> 29:39.988
I think that's the problem.

29:41.627 --> 29:43.586
Hey, you want to know
what worked for me?

29:43.674 --> 29:45.188
Hmm?

29:45.687 --> 29:47.516
Having people
you care about.

29:49.324 --> 29:51.352
People you want
to take care of.

29:53.314 --> 29:56.603
That will turn you into the man
that you want to be.

29:57.985 --> 29:59.876
But the fact that
you're already asking

29:59.964 --> 30:01.917
these kind of questions...

30:02.329 --> 30:03.805
that's a good sign.

30:05.868 --> 30:07.368
Okay.

30:07.776 --> 30:08.993
Thanks.

30:17.131 --> 30:18.484
Hey.

30:19.587 --> 30:20.696
Hey.

30:20.923 --> 30:22.590
How long were you, uh...?

30:22.678 --> 30:24.204
Just for a few seconds.

30:24.367 --> 30:25.655
- Oh.
- But I heard

30:25.743 --> 30:27.587
everything else
on the baby monitor.

30:28.516 --> 30:30.437
Aw, come on.

30:39.065 --> 30:40.753
Are you okay?

30:42.397 --> 30:43.787
Everyone's worried about you.

30:43.924 --> 30:45.391
Mm-hmm.

30:46.835 --> 30:48.448
I know.

30:51.645 --> 30:53.797
You know,
so many doctors warned me.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.711
So many doctors told me
not to have a baby.

31:02.753 --> 31:03.782
Told me...

31:03.870 --> 31:06.904
...about the risks,
but I decided to...

31:07.194 --> 31:09.274
do it anyway.

31:11.976 --> 31:14.010
It's hard not to feel
like it's my fault.

31:14.098 --> 31:15.196
- Kate, come on...
- No.

31:15.346 --> 31:16.672
Let me wallow.

31:25.353 --> 31:27.761
Why does he cry every time
I go to pick him up?

31:29.231 --> 31:30.861
Am I doing something wrong?

31:31.697 --> 31:32.902
No.

31:33.045 --> 31:35.313
- No.
- He, like, loses his mind

31:35.401 --> 31:37.696
every time
I go to pick him up. I...

31:37.888 --> 31:39.912
- Oh.
- I don't think he likes me.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.024
No, no, no, no, no.
He likes you fine.

31:42.112 --> 31:45.126
You just,
you have to warn him first.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.790
Right? Because he can't see you,
so you have to...

31:47.878 --> 31:49.850
You got to brace him
for what's coming.

31:50.222 --> 31:51.657
Right? So then you just,

31:51.745 --> 31:54.489
- you narrate what's happening.
- Okay.

31:54.577 --> 31:56.446
Right? So all the baby stuff

31:56.534 --> 31:58.571
- that you normally do with your face...
- Mm-hmm.

31:58.711 --> 32:01.422
...it's with your voice
and with your touch.

32:01.510 --> 32:02.859
- Oh.
- Yeah.

32:02.947 --> 32:04.454
Right? Okay.

32:05.122 --> 32:06.579
Hey, buddy, it's your mama.

32:07.251 --> 32:09.243
Can you feel my hand?

32:09.633 --> 32:11.995
Okay, I'm gonna pick you up now,
okay?

32:12.426 --> 32:14.227
Okay, bud?

32:14.315 --> 32:15.521
Okay.

32:15.609 --> 32:17.271
Oh, my goodness. Hi.

32:18.935 --> 32:20.036
Come here.

32:20.124 --> 32:21.411
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:21.499 --> 32:24.629
Okay, I'm gonna give you
to Uncle Kev, okay?

32:25.007 --> 32:26.794
You're gonna love him.

32:26.882 --> 32:28.903
And he always smells
really expensive.

32:29.006 --> 32:30.693
I got you.

32:31.970 --> 32:34.052
So I'm your Uncle Kevin.

32:34.277 --> 32:35.568
Yeah.

32:35.656 --> 32:37.539
I'm gonna teach you
how to pick up girls.

32:37.627 --> 32:39.651
We're gonna do that.
Or boys.

32:39.739 --> 32:42.864
Or robots, if that's what people
are into in the future.

32:43.134 --> 32:45.007
Oh, this is great.

32:45.516 --> 32:46.842
Hey. Hey.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.438
Oh, he's perfect.

32:55.215 --> 32:57.160
Cliff really said
he wanted to kiss me?

32:57.265 --> 32:59.392
Yes. Just go behind
the snack shack

32:59.480 --> 33:01.426
and he'll meet you
back there.

33:03.621 --> 33:05.511
Okay.

33:14.424 --> 33:15.913
Hey, Kate.

33:16.539 --> 33:18.046
Stewart?

33:18.669 --> 33:21.013
Oh, Stewart.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.108
Who did you think
it was gonna be?

33:24.659 --> 33:26.144
Cliff Ward.

33:27.026 --> 33:28.867
Who did you think
I was gonna be?

33:30.070 --> 33:31.433
You.

33:35.542 --> 33:37.403
We can just stand here
for a minute

33:37.491 --> 33:39.166
and they'll all leave.

33:39.919 --> 33:41.216
Okay.

33:45.799 --> 33:46.925
You know what?

33:47.285 --> 33:48.902
No.

34:01.479 --> 34:04.589
Okay, so tell me about this
movie offer in Chicago.

34:04.677 --> 34:06.668
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna
take it, though, you know?

34:06.755 --> 34:09.322
I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna
stay here with you guys.

34:09.802 --> 34:11.915
'Cause I'm so helpful.

34:13.831 --> 34:15.076
I wish that you would have

34:15.164 --> 34:18.072
as much compassion for yourself
as you do for me.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.212
Go to Chicago.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.996
Do this movie.
Focus on your sobriety.

34:24.628 --> 34:26.839
You're gonna be Jack's uncle
for your entire life.

34:26.927 --> 34:29.042
And he's gonna need you
at your best.

34:34.033 --> 34:35.291
He's the luckiest kid
in the world

34:35.378 --> 34:37.135
to have you as a mom,
you know that?

34:39.652 --> 34:41.735
Aren't you?
Do you know that?

34:42.244 --> 34:43.572
Let me look at you.

34:43.661 --> 34:44.654
Ah.

34:44.742 --> 34:47.808
Oh, you're gorgeous.
You're gorgeous.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.222
Okay.

34:52.011 --> 34:53.525
So here's what's up.

34:54.254 --> 34:55.900
I know this is all new

34:56.045 --> 34:57.753
and I know
that everyone is worried

34:57.885 --> 34:59.722
about us and about me.

35:00.299 --> 35:01.596
Jack can't see,

35:01.684 --> 35:04.557
but he can hear, he can sense,
he can feel.

35:05.477 --> 35:06.922
And I don't want worry

35:07.010 --> 35:08.667
to be the prevailing feeling
in this home.

35:08.755 --> 35:10.599
I want it to be hope.

35:11.095 --> 35:13.618
I mean, we spent the entire day
being worried about

35:13.706 --> 35:16.706
what we have to limit around
here in order to protect him.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.712
That's just not how we roll
in this house.

35:18.814 --> 35:20.595
No... No offense, Anna,
I'm sorry.

35:20.683 --> 35:21.737
I know that's like
a monster

35:21.825 --> 35:22.861
- part of your job.
- It's all good.

35:22.948 --> 35:25.440
Okay.
My son is gonna live

35:25.558 --> 35:26.776
a life without limits.

35:26.902 --> 35:28.909
I know my family
can't give him sight,

35:28.997 --> 35:30.879
but they can damn sure
give him that.

35:31.167 --> 35:33.675
So... who's in?

35:34.211 --> 35:38.688
Well, you had me at,
"Okay, so here's what's up."

35:38.776 --> 35:40.007
Mom?

35:40.095 --> 35:42.550
Of course I'm in.
Of course.

35:43.386 --> 35:45.589
I know that w-we're all
trying to have a family moment,

35:45.677 --> 35:48.220
but he... this is a... his, uh,
pants are a disaster right now.

35:48.308 --> 35:50.331
He's... That's foul.

35:50.419 --> 35:51.419
Oh.

35:51.556 --> 35:53.894
Did he just laugh?
Did you just laugh?

36:02.264 --> 36:05.496
- We really have to do this?
- Yes, we have to.

36:05.584 --> 36:06.851
And we're gonna do
a thing first,

36:06.938 --> 36:08.818
so settle in.

36:09.537 --> 36:11.412
Uh, there's no denying it.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.148
You three are getting old.

36:13.389 --> 36:16.137
Old as dirt.
So I think it's time,

36:16.225 --> 36:18.412
uh, we let you girls in
on a little game

36:18.500 --> 36:20.037
your mother and I play.

36:20.275 --> 36:22.568
It's called
"Worst Case Scenario."

36:22.656 --> 36:23.748
- No.
- Ah.

36:23.836 --> 36:25.669
Now, the rules are simple.

36:26.005 --> 36:28.529
We all go around and we say
"worst case scenario,"

36:28.672 --> 36:32.136
and then our biggest fears
as to the worst possible way

36:32.224 --> 36:34.148
our lives could go
from this move.

36:34.467 --> 36:36.380
Now, if you don't want to go,
you don't have to, but...

36:36.467 --> 36:37.865
Worst case scenario:

36:37.988 --> 36:39.841
Randall never gets over himself

36:39.929 --> 36:41.967
and I have to spend
the next four years

36:42.055 --> 36:44.334
trapped in my room
like Rapunzel.

36:44.740 --> 36:46.584
Wow. That was good.

36:46.734 --> 36:48.334
I'm a fast learner.

36:48.422 --> 36:49.455
My turn.

36:50.195 --> 36:51.678
Worst case scenario:

36:52.467 --> 36:55.045
Tomorrow when Deja takes
the bus to school, she forgets

36:55.133 --> 36:56.740
to text me the moment
she arrives,

36:56.828 --> 36:59.865
and then I'm forced to ground
her until she turns 18.

37:00.155 --> 37:01.198
W-W-Wait.
You're gonna let me...

37:01.285 --> 37:03.404
A text the moment
you get to school.

37:03.734 --> 37:05.045
Every single day.

37:05.342 --> 37:06.639
Yes, sir.

37:07.112 --> 37:09.045
All right, worst case scenario.

37:09.639 --> 37:13.998
Um, that I project
my own stuff

37:14.086 --> 37:15.889
on to you girls,
making you feel

37:15.977 --> 37:18.621
anything less than your
wonderful, beautiful,

37:18.709 --> 37:21.255
wildly unique selves.

37:22.740 --> 37:23.865
Tess.

37:24.967 --> 37:26.037
I don't have one.

37:26.251 --> 37:27.318
Nothing?

37:27.451 --> 37:29.521
Nope.
Philly looks good on me.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.771
Worst case scenario:

37:31.859 --> 37:34.514
All of my friends back home
forget about me.

37:35.014 --> 37:38.334
Wow, babe. Have you been worried
about that?

37:38.482 --> 37:40.670
Why didn't you say
anything sooner?

37:40.874 --> 37:42.931
I'm just messing with you.

37:43.019 --> 37:44.076
All right.

37:44.275 --> 37:45.506
So...

37:46.249 --> 37:47.482
We ready to do this?

37:49.622 --> 37:50.771
Last one up the steps is

37:50.859 --> 37:52.004
- buying cheese steaks.
- Wait! - Wait! - Wait!

37:52.091 --> 37:53.597
