15:01.484 --> 15:03.986
on our first family vacation.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.281
It was a cross-country trip

15:04.028 --> 15:07.281
and it was a tough march

15:07.323 --> 15:09.450
with that 40-pound pack.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.450
You know, man?

15:11.411 --> 15:14.873
I remember everybody in our

15:11.411 --> 15:14.873
family had to get brush-cuts

15:14.914 --> 15:15.998
even grandma.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.876
'Yeah, that was..'

15:17.917 --> 15:20.044
Boy, poor gram,

15:17.917 --> 15:20.044
she hated playing bingo

15:20.086 --> 15:21.629
with that half-inch

15:20.086 --> 15:21.629
of blue hair, you know?

15:21.671 --> 15:23.840
It was uh..

15:21.671 --> 15:23.840
Yeah.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.592
[crowd cheering]

15:25.633 --> 15:29.095

15:33.057 --> 15:36.853
So, I'm a, I'm a single guy,

15:33.057 --> 15:36.853
which is great, but uh..

15:36.895 --> 15:39.980
[girls cheer]

15:36.895 --> 15:39.980
Thank you.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.980
Oh, come on.

15:40.022 --> 15:41.691
Which is great,

15:40.022 --> 15:41.691
being a single guy

15:41.733 --> 15:44.068
but the only problem is

15:41.733 --> 15:44.068
dealing with other single guys.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.278
Especially cool guys, you know.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.738

15:48.823 --> 15:51.158
it looks cool.

You know, whenever

16:04.881 --> 16:06.299
they recognize somebody

16:06.340 --> 16:08.426
they'd always do that

16:06.340 --> 16:08.426
phony gun-point thing.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.636
It's like..

16:15.934 --> 16:17.769
Hey.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.646
How's it going?

16:19.687 --> 16:22.106
What's that?

16:19.687 --> 16:22.106

16:33.409 --> 16:36.454
I'm wobbling my head right now.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.205
Some guys, you know,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.205
they think they're cool.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.416
They don't seem to have that

16:38.247 --> 16:40.416
head coordination down properly.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.127
They're going up to women like

16:40.458 --> 16:43.127
"Hey, how's it going?"

16:47.548 --> 16:49.759
I was in a bar once,

16:47.548 --> 16:49.759
this guy's head flew right off.

16:49.801 --> 16:53.847
I went, "That is the coolest guy

16:49.801 --> 16:53.847
I've ever seen in my life."

in some godforsaken place

20:19.177 --> 20:21.595
that you were goofing off
