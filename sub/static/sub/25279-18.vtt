WEBVTT

00:07.882 --> 00:11.594
So Joanne, Beau tells me you're visiting
your daughter out in Arizona.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.555
Or as Beau called it,

00:14.139 --> 00:15.849
an even shittier New Mexico.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.602
Yeah, she's doing really well.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.271
She has a new boyfriend named "Travis."

00:22.355 --> 00:25.191
He has a ring in his nose,
his eyebrow, and his lip.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.027
His face looks like a fucking Zales.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.365
But... he's really good
with my granddaughter.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.953
Travis, Jason, and Chad...

00:37.037 --> 00:39.581
three names that just say,
"I'm a dipshit."

00:41.541 --> 00:45.295
So you're a long way from Detroit.
Must be different livin' on a ranch.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.839
Uh, no, not so different.

00:47.922 --> 00:50.884
Smells the same.
A lot of burnt-out buildings.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.385
Everyone's got a gun.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.639
Been good havin' Luke around.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.727
Unlike Colt, when I asked him
to help me work on the truck,

01:00.810 --> 01:03.104
he didn't ask to get paid in hugs.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.735
Although if that is an option,
I'd take one.

01:10.987 --> 01:12.072
It's not.

01:13.031 --> 01:16.284
So, what was wrong with the truck?
Is it 'cause it's a Ford?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.787
[Beau guffaws insincerely]

01:20.914 --> 01:23.208
Y'know, they say on a quiet night

01:23.291 --> 01:25.668
you can hear the sound of a Ford rust.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.005
I told him to get a Dodge.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.590
[vehicle approaches]

01:30.757 --> 01:33.885
What does he want a Dodge for?
Is he startin' a bonfire?

01:33.968 --> 01:35.345
[guffaws] Right.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.806
-Hey, Beau.
-Hey, Lisa.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.349
-Joanne.
-Hey, Lisa.

01:39.432 --> 01:43.436
Luke, this is Lisa Neumann, runs
the biggest cow operation in the state.

01:44.020 --> 01:45.772
This is my nephew, Luke.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.524
He drives a Dodge.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.569
And Dodge isn't even in NASCAR.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.156
Neither are dragons
and I still want to ride one of them.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.661
I'm sorry for stopping by so late,

01:59.744 --> 02:02.664
but my bank needs you
to sign these contracts

02:02.747 --> 02:04.207
before I can pick up your cattle.

02:05.416 --> 02:06.417
Damn bankers.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.338
I miss the days when all you needed
was a handshake,

02:10.421 --> 02:12.924
and you could shoot anybody
that came on your property,

02:13.007 --> 02:14.801
-no questions asked.
-[Lisa chuckles]

02:16.219 --> 02:19.389
Would a 12-year-old bottle
of Pappy Van Winkle help you?

02:20.640 --> 02:21.766
How'd they wait that long?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.894
I mean, if this was mine,
it'd be 30-second Pappy Van Winkle.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.273
You're doing the right thing.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.441
Yeah, I know.

02:30.608 --> 02:34.070
It'd be good to slow down a bit
'til the next breeding season starts.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.615
Spend a little time with my family
instead of

02:37.699 --> 02:39.742
obsessing over every little detail.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.665
I'm not signin' these contracts
with fuckin' blue ink.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.293
Here.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.170
A black pen.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.422
Or would you like a red one?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.008
I know that's the color
you prefer your states.

03:00.346 --> 03:01.264
There you go.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.765
Well, Beau...

03:03.808 --> 03:05.560
I've been waiting a long time to say this:

03:06.227 --> 03:09.564
These are my cows now,
so you stay the fuck away from them.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.943
Here's to doin' business with you.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.820
Flag on the play. I, um...

03:18.531 --> 03:20.033
didn't know we were waitin'.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.075
To Beau Bennett.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.786
-Woo!
-Hey!

03:23.870 --> 03:25.872
What the hell's goin' on out here?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.250
It's the middle of the night!

03:29.334 --> 03:30.877
It's eight o'clock.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.880
Yeah, well, when the sun goes down
so does the fuckin' radio.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.635
-Shit, is that Pappy Van Winkle?
-[Lisa chuckles]

03:40.803 --> 03:43.348
We gotta keep her down
or Abby's gonna lose her shit.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.374
[Luke] Okay, I got one for you.

04:51.457 --> 04:54.752
From the waist down,
you look like John Holmes.

04:58.715 --> 05:02.051
From the ears up,
you look like Telly Savalas. No hair.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.972
I'll say the same thing
I've said for the last five, "hair."

05:07.682 --> 05:09.767
It's <i>always</i> gonna be the hair.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.605
-Hey, babe. Where you been?
-Hey.

05:14.689 --> 05:18.443
I just ran to the grocery store
and on my way home I got pulled over.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.402
What?

05:19.485 --> 05:22.280
Couldn't even do my cleavage thing
'cause the cop was a chick.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.536
You show your cleavage to the cops?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.497
Not just cops. I get refills at Starbucks.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.376
I get free appetizers at Chili's.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.837
I've even been upgraded on flights.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.132
Wait a second, you left me in coach!

05:43.593 --> 05:46.012
You told me they screwed up
the boardin' passes.

05:49.140 --> 05:52.185
I tried to flirt my way out of a ticket
once with a female cop.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.980
DUI thing, and I said...

05:56.064 --> 05:58.524
I'll blow into yours
if you blow into mine.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.321
What'd they stop you for?

06:03.905 --> 06:06.282
Peyton was up front 'cause my pickup
doesn't have a back seat.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.451
We really need a safe, family car.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.578
Luke's good with cars.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.748
We oughta get him to bolt a couch
to the bed of your pickup truck.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.586
You know, I've done it,
and I don't recommend it.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.673
[Colt] Yeah, whatever.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.592
Well, he's crazy.

06:24.675 --> 06:28.429
He thought the lazy-boy tractor
was a bad idea 'til we tried it.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.392
Where's your dad?

06:32.475 --> 06:35.144
Oh, he's at the shooting range
with Joanne.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.314
Apparently, they got an early-bird special
for senior citizens.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.236
He wanted to get there first
so he'd get that handicapped spot.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.866
Old, blind and deaf,
nothing left to lose, handling firearms...

06:48.950 --> 06:50.284
-What could go wrong?
-Right?

06:52.537 --> 06:55.123
I'm happy for him. At least
he's taking advantage of his time off.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.959
Too bad Lisa didn't offer
to take our cattle to market.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.253
She did.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.004
What? When?

07:02.296 --> 07:04.048
Same time she offered my dad.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.218
Why you got that face,
like I just binge-watched

07:07.301 --> 07:09.804
the entire season of <i>Stranger Things</i>
without you?

07:11.597 --> 07:14.809
No, Colt, it's the "Why am I hearing
about this for the first time?" face.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.311
I should know that one by now.

07:19.897 --> 07:23.192
That's a pretty big decision to make
without talking to me first.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.862
What I... Well... I... I work all day.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.906
What you want me to do? Give you a
play-by-play of everything that happened?

07:28.990 --> 07:31.742
Yesterday you came home
and talked to me for 45 minutes

07:31.826 --> 07:34.495
about which cows were dating,
and which ones were single.

07:36.080 --> 07:36.956
What?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.042
-Don't you fuckin' start with me.
-What?

07:40.126 --> 07:45.214
You liked it! You was talkin' about havin'
cow weddings, veils, dresses and shit.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.219
I just like to be involved with things
that affect our family.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.598
All right. I'm sorry.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.893
-I'm meeting a buyer this mornin'.
-Oh?

07:56.976 --> 07:59.437
Frank Stephens, old friend of my dad's

07:59.520 --> 08:01.898
he's dealt with before,
see if we can work something out.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.484
Okay. Thank you for telling me.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.821
Maybe tonight we can binge-watch
the new season of <i>Stranger Things.</i>

08:12.241 --> 08:13.326
Yes...

08:14.452 --> 08:16.162
We got one more thing we gotta talk about.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.247
[mouths without speaking]

08:20.833 --> 08:23.252
I wish you would have
let me do all this for you, Beau.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.963
You're supposed to be
taking it easy now and relaxing.

08:28.633 --> 08:31.427
I'm loading fence posts
into the back of a truck.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.095
This is my Disneyland.

08:36.724 --> 08:39.268
So, I know you're gonna have
some down time

08:39.352 --> 08:42.813
and I thought maybe you could
teach me a little more about ranching.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.442
I overheard you sayin'
there's a breeding season for cows.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.528
I'd love to know about that.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.279
I mean, I don't need to watch 'em.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.740
Unless that's part of it.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.701
I'll teach you whatever you wanna know.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.245
[Dale] Hey, Beau!

08:57.328 --> 08:58.996
Hey, Dale.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.624
This is my nephew, Luke.
Luke, Dale's our vet.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.377
He's also my most annoying friend.

09:06.170 --> 09:11.551
I'm also his only friend, which also
makes me his least annoying friend.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.554
Game, set, match, motherfucker.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.598
[Luke laughs]

09:18.266 --> 09:19.684
Good to meet you, Dale.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.145
You guys ever consider doing a podcast
together? 'Cause I would listen.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.065
Well, sure I have.
I've asked him to be on my podcast,

09:26.941 --> 09:28.192
<i>You Got Dale.</i>

09:30.820 --> 09:33.364
Lunch is ready! Grilled cheese sandwiches.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.909
Well, look at that,
I dropped by just at lunchtime.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.327
What are the odds of that?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.038
One hundred percent.

09:41.789 --> 09:42.790
Let's go.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.460
Hey, Dale, Charlene called.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.422
She said you're on a strict diet.
I'm not supposed to feed you.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.924
And she also found all those Butterfingers
in your sock drawer.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.886
Oh, come on, with a wife like that

09:55.970 --> 09:58.306
why would I want to extend my life?

10:01.892 --> 10:03.269
Oh, Luke...

10:04.312 --> 10:06.230
how come I never heard of you before?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.150
Well, that's kind of a funny story.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.277
My dad was Beau's brother,

10:11.360 --> 10:13.904
but he died in Vietnam before I was born.

10:14.488 --> 10:16.407
I didn't even know
about this side of the family

10:16.490 --> 10:19.535
until my mom told me
on her deathbed two weeks ago.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.497
Maybe I should not have led
with "kind of a funny story."

10:25.916 --> 10:27.918
Well, you're no Dane Cook.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.546
[loud beeping]

10:30.713 --> 10:33.132
-[Beau] What the hell?
-[Joanne] I left the stove on.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.468
[beeping continues]

10:35.843 --> 10:37.428
[Beau] Jesus Christ!

10:37.511 --> 10:39.555
Ow, hey, hey, hey!

10:39.639 --> 10:42.183
[beeping continues]

10:42.850 --> 10:43.768
Is Luke okay?

10:43.851 --> 10:46.395
-[beeping continues]
-The damn smoke alarm.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.482
The boy's got a lot of shit in his head.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.399
[beeping stops]

10:51.692 --> 10:53.819
Stuff he brought home from Iraq.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.196
Is he getting any help?

10:55.279 --> 10:58.324
He tried, but according to Beau,
the VA's overloaded.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.701
I gotta friend, Jack,

11:00.785 --> 11:03.204
works for the VA at Grand Junction.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.539
Maybe he can cut through
some of that red tape.

11:05.873 --> 11:08.626
Well, thanks, Dale. I owe you one.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.588
Government doesn't have the funding
to support our troops,

11:12.672 --> 11:15.925
but they can afford to issue
a commemorative <i>Star Trek</i> stamp.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.054
Yeah, it's a damn shame.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.515
But I will say this,

11:22.598 --> 11:26.060
your Christmas cards
can have a Klingon up in the corner.

11:31.273 --> 11:32.149
Colt!

11:32.733 --> 11:35.361
Hey, Mr. Stephens. How you doin'?

11:35.986 --> 11:37.697
-Good.
-All right. Oh.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.740
Shit... cow shit.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.991
[cow moos]

11:41.242 --> 11:43.035
Yeah, I know, it's yours.

11:43.119 --> 11:45.496
It'd be a lot weirder
if I wasn't a rancher, huh?

11:46.622 --> 11:50.000
Y'know, the last time I saw you, you
couldn't have been more than 16 years old.

11:50.501 --> 11:53.087
And you were payin'
some crazy, old, drunk guy

11:53.170 --> 11:55.423
to buy you rum and Cokes
at one of our Applebee's.

11:56.048 --> 11:57.341
I remember that.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.968
Y'know, Hank's still around.

12:00.636 --> 12:02.555
Get a chance to check out the herd?

12:02.638 --> 12:04.724
Yeah, I did. They look good.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.309
But, boy, how many head
are you looking to sell?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.146
One-twenty.

12:10.229 --> 12:15.067
It would be 121 but it turns out my friend
Beer Pong can do ten push-ups, so...

12:17.403 --> 12:18.487
One-twenty, huh?

12:19.155 --> 12:20.948
All right, how's this sound?

12:21.031 --> 12:24.910
I'll buy 118 and then I'll knock out
20 push-ups for the other two.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.456
You'll buy 'em all?

12:29.373 --> 12:30.291
Well, that's awesome.

12:30.374 --> 12:34.336
How you feel about being carried around
a bar on the shoulders of a grown-ass man?

12:36.505 --> 12:39.550
I feel like that's a weird thing
for a grown-ass man to say.

12:43.179 --> 12:45.097
How does $1.40 a pound sound?

12:47.641 --> 12:51.020
Whoa, that's way too low.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.731
The quality of these cows, I'm thinkin'...

12:54.607 --> 12:55.691
like 1.60.

12:56.025 --> 13:00.112
Hmm. What I'm offerin' is a fair price
for a first-time rancher.

13:00.696 --> 13:03.032
Now if it was your dad, it'd be different,

13:03.115 --> 13:05.659
but nobody knows
who the hell Colt Bennett is.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.622
Mmm... Garrison PD'd beg to differ
with you on that.

13:10.706 --> 13:14.043
Look, this herd's
every bit as good as my dad's.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.297
But your dad and Iron River
have 40 years' reputation behind them.

13:18.380 --> 13:22.343
That's 40 years of impeccable breeding
and superior genetics.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.429
All right, look...

13:26.013 --> 13:28.974
I... If I take $1.40
that's gonna be like...

13:29.642 --> 13:31.393
twenty, thirty grand out of my pocket.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.479
I won't be able to run this ranch,

13:33.562 --> 13:34.688
let alone live.

13:34.772 --> 13:38.108
I'm buildin' a house,
I just got married, I got a newborn.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.445
I don't wanna sell
to someone else, but...

13:42.446 --> 13:43.656
I will if I have to.

13:45.574 --> 13:47.743
I get it. Good luck.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.621
Fuck. Okay, bluff called.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.625
Colt, no buyer is gonna give you
a better deal than that,

13:54.708 --> 13:58.379
and I am probably giving you more than
I should because you're a family friend.

13:58.462 --> 14:01.465
Bill Metill offered me a buck-fifty
two weeks ago.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.843
I turned it down
'cause I knew I was comin' to you.

14:03.926 --> 14:07.513
Well, if you had called me,
I would have told you to take that deal.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.724
I'm really sorry, Colt. Um...

14:11.851 --> 14:12.893
Give your dad my best.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.606
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

14:17.690 --> 14:20.651
look, I know it's not much,
but here's a couple coupons.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.987
That's a free dessert,
good at any Applebee's.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.992
With purchase of entrée?!

14:28.492 --> 14:29.743
Well, come on, man!

14:36.834 --> 14:37.835
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.545
Check it out.
I was looking at some cars.

14:39.628 --> 14:42.506
This minivan has a fridge built in
between the seats.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.049
We could store Peyton's milk

14:44.133 --> 14:47.469
or sandwiches or, who am I kiddin'?...
we could have ice-cold beers <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>car.</i>

14:52.433 --> 14:54.643
[unenthusiastically]
Well, that sounds great.

14:56.270 --> 14:57.229
"Great?"

14:58.022 --> 15:01.108
Ice-cold beers in the car,
that's how you would drive to heaven.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.947
What is goin' on?
Did the meeting not go well?

15:10.367 --> 15:11.702
Bid came in a little low.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.745
How low?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.458
Twenty to thirty grand too low.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.877
Jesus Christ, that's crazy.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.754
-We can't take that.
-I know.

15:22.671 --> 15:24.131
That's why I told him no.

15:24.214 --> 15:26.759
So what are we gonna do?
Did you talk to other buyers?

15:27.343 --> 15:29.803
Of course. I talked to every buyer
from here to Iowa.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.766
They all offered like twice the price,
but I thought I'd lead with the bad news.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.729
You don't have to be a jerk.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.940
You asked me to communicate.
I tell you what's goin' on,

15:41.023 --> 15:44.360
you're like, "Jesus Christ, that's bad!"
Yeah, I know it's bad!

15:45.235 --> 15:46.654
That's been communicated.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.119
So... now what?

15:57.665 --> 15:58.540
I don't know.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.753
-We'll figure it out.
-We'll figure it out?

16:02.836 --> 16:05.589
-I'm sorry, I'm freakin' out right now.
-Yeah, I know.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.217
I get it.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.720
It's gonna be okay.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.431
Please.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.725
Just trust me.

16:19.895 --> 16:20.980
I trust you.

16:23.190 --> 16:24.066
Yeah.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.860
I'll find a buyer.

16:29.238 --> 16:33.158
Sell the cattle and in a month from now
you can be sittin' in the front seat

16:33.242 --> 16:35.744
of a new minivan, drinkin' ice-cold beer.

16:38.455 --> 16:39.999
Holy shit, is that the price?!

16:40.916 --> 16:44.128
You're gonna be in a used minivan,
drinking lukewarm beer.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.760
You okay?

16:52.928 --> 16:54.513
Yeah. I'm fine.

16:55.347 --> 16:56.473
I mean...

16:57.516 --> 17:00.811
I ran out of a burning house,
leaving three senior citizens

17:00.894 --> 17:03.439
and a mom and a baby upstairs, so...

17:04.523 --> 17:05.733
No, I'm pretty good.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.487
Don't worry about it. Dale was happy
he got another grilled cheese.

17:15.951 --> 17:16.827
So listen...

17:19.079 --> 17:21.832
Dale told me he knows some guy
down at the VA

17:21.915 --> 17:24.334
that can help cut through
all the red tape.

17:25.335 --> 17:29.381
He also said he knows some guy that'll
get you a good deal on some Yeezys,

17:30.090 --> 17:31.633
whatever in the fuck that is.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.556
That's nice of Dale and...

17:38.348 --> 17:41.685
you as well, but my problems
aren't your responsibility, Beau.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.645
And to be honest,

17:43.729 --> 17:46.565
I'm about as interested in telling
a bunch of strangers my problems

17:46.648 --> 17:48.484
as I am listening to theirs.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.488
Oh, I don't need a DNA test.
You are definitely related to me.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.576
But some problems you can't solve
on your own, son.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.583
Y'know, last time I went to the VA,

18:04.666 --> 18:07.086
they just shuffled me
from doctor to doctor.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.630
Each one wrote me
a different prescription.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.802
Only thing I learned is, if you mix
a red pill, a blue pill, and two yellows,

18:14.885 --> 18:18.722
side effects may include waking up
in the claw machine at a Dave & Buster's.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.436
Dale said they're gonna have
a group meeting tomorrow night.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.688
There'd be a chair for you.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.985
Oh, I don't know.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.780
Why don't you give it a chance?

18:34.863 --> 18:36.782
If it'll help, I'll even go with you.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.327
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:40.410 --> 18:41.912
-You'll go with me?
-Sure.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.373
Well, I wanna see that.

18:45.624 --> 18:46.750
Thank you. I'll do it.

18:47.376 --> 18:48.252
Okay.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.673
Settle for a hand hug.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.009
Pick you up tomorrow night at 6:30.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.346
Maybe we can check out
Dale's podcast on the way.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.305
No.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.484
Hey, Ms. Neumann.

19:12.568 --> 19:14.361
Thanks for meeting with me.

19:14.444 --> 19:16.446
I have friends that I see less than you.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.449
Friends I like, friends I care about.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.953
Friends that didn't come to my suite
at the Broncos game

19:23.036 --> 19:24.496
and kiss Peyton Manning.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.041
He had it coming. Wait.

19:28.125 --> 19:32.296
You have friends that give you
free desserts at Applebee's?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.798
Oh, with purchase of an entrée, really?

19:36.925 --> 19:38.218
So what can I do for you?

19:40.095 --> 19:41.054
Well...

19:42.222 --> 19:43.557
I've been thinking about it...

19:44.433 --> 19:45.475
and...

19:46.351 --> 19:47.477
I'm gonna accept your offer.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.190
I'm ready to be a part
of the Neumann's Hill family.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.733
Colt Neumann, at your service.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.486
Hey, I know I've only been on the team
for like eight seconds,

19:56.862 --> 19:59.823
but when I get the company truck
can I get an extended cab?

19:59.907 --> 20:02.367
'Cause I'd really prefer
to not have to buy a couch.

20:04.828 --> 20:07.456
Colt, I've already made
all my deals for the year.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.124
I can't take on any more cows.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.878
[stuttering]

20:13.337 --> 20:14.463
What about your offer?

20:14.546 --> 20:18.217
Yeah, that was two weeks ago,
and you said no, so I moved on.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.510
Okay, you're right,

20:20.594 --> 20:22.012
I screwed up on that.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.307
It's like when the cops asked me
if I was done being tased.

20:25.390 --> 20:26.767
I shoulda said yes.

20:30.896 --> 20:34.399
This is the last chance I have
to break even on the year.

20:34.483 --> 20:38.070
I'm sorry. I wish you had taken my offer
when your dad did.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.072
Look, okay...

20:40.656 --> 20:42.950
Is there something we can do here?

20:43.533 --> 20:45.160
Well, I'm not gonna buy your cows.

20:45.994 --> 20:49.331
But I am still interested
in buying your ranch.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.085
Come on now, I came here to sell my cows,

20:53.168 --> 20:54.795
not give up on my dream.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.506
I love that you're a dreamer...

20:57.965 --> 21:01.218
but being an independent rancher
has never been harder,

21:01.301 --> 21:03.053
and I think you're finding that out.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.556
Look, I wish you all the best,
Colt, I really do.

21:07.724 --> 21:08.850
But...

21:08.934 --> 21:11.311
if it ever gets to be too much...

21:12.646 --> 21:13.522
I'm here.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.900
I would rather lose everything...

21:17.609 --> 21:18.860
than sell my ranch.

21:27.244 --> 21:28.537
Thank you for your time.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.922
-Hey.
-What's up?

21:39.172 --> 21:41.425
Oh, I told Abby
I was out pickin' up diapers.

21:43.218 --> 21:44.970
Keep a big box of 'em here.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.808
Y'know, you can't get kicked out
of a bar for having diapers.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.519
You can get kicked out of a Sam's Club
for drinkin' a beer.

21:55.272 --> 21:59.443
Y'know, they'll also throw you outta there
for having sex in the handicapped stall.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.613
The girl had an eye patch on,

22:03.697 --> 22:05.157
she needed the extra room.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.582
Y'know, I once had sex
with a girl in a manhole.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.046
That doesn't really sound right.
Your story's cooler.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.218
You're drinkin' Keystone Light?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.305
Damn straight, I'm drinkin' Keystone.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.432
Owned by the same company
that owns Coors.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.601
Tastes the same.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.227
Both got mountains on the can.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.481
Only difference is
Keystone's are sideways.

22:39.524 --> 22:42.652
Guess what? For an extra dollar,
I can live with sideways mountains.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.073
-Ho... ly... shit.
-[Luke] Mm-hmm.

22:46.406 --> 22:49.743
I'm telling you, it's just like
that Tylenol brand, pain relief,

22:49.826 --> 22:51.578
versus CVS brand.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.331
You crush those fuckers up,
you snort 'em up,

22:54.915 --> 22:56.458
you're gonna feel the same way.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.255
We gotta get you in front of a crowd.
You could be president.

23:04.049 --> 23:07.386
I mean, you gotta fuck a couple
porn stars, but we'll get you there.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.767
So what's happening with you?

23:16.478 --> 23:19.564
I've been trying for the last couple days
to sell my cattle.

23:21.024 --> 23:22.109
Looks like I'm fucked.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.653
You try talking to your dad?

23:25.320 --> 23:27.906
He knows a shit-ton about ranchin'.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.701
And the guy's been trying to help me
and I certainly don't deserve it.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.245
Yeah, well...

23:33.954 --> 23:35.705
You ain't his fuck-up son.

23:36.873 --> 23:38.291
You're his perfect nephew.

23:38.583 --> 23:39.418
[Luke] Hmm.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.963
I've got a big ole baggie
of Tylenol powder in the truck

23:43.046 --> 23:44.423
that would say otherwise.

23:49.094 --> 23:51.638
I just feel like I'm lettin'
my whole family down.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.142
I can relate.

23:55.851 --> 23:57.769
You wanna talk to me about it?

24:02.065 --> 24:03.400
Not really.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.279
-Wanna talk to me about your shitty life?
-No, no, no, no.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.365
Not at all.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.828
Wanna blindfold each other,
see if we can taste the difference

24:14.911 --> 24:15.954
between Keystone and Coors?

24:19.541 --> 24:20.709
Fuck, yeah, I do.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.047
[TV on]

24:26.465 --> 24:27.966
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.510
What are you doing here?

24:31.761 --> 24:33.096
Is that CNN?

24:33.388 --> 24:36.516
No! No, I was just,
y'know, clickin' through.

24:38.351 --> 24:39.853
Fuckin' fake news.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.355
Yeah.

24:43.732 --> 24:47.486
So I went to pick up Luke
to take him to the VA meeting,

24:47.569 --> 24:49.029
and he's not at the hunting cabin.

24:50.238 --> 24:53.074
Not answerin' his phone
and Dale said he didn't show up.

24:53.533 --> 24:54.784
Oh shit.

24:56.036 --> 24:57.662
I guess he's not ready.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.789
Well, he said he'd be there.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.833
We shook hands on it.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.046
Y'know, I was gonna surprise him,

25:06.630 --> 25:09.591
let him listen to Dale's podcast
on the way over.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.093
Well, fuck that.

25:14.930 --> 25:17.432
You can't force people to get help, Beau.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.603
To get my daughter to rehab,
I actually tied her up

25:21.686 --> 25:23.021
and threw her in the truck, once.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.357
That still didn't work.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.859
Second I untied her,
she bit me and ran off.

25:29.653 --> 25:32.822
The point of him stayin' here
was to help him get through this shit.

25:33.865 --> 25:35.575
I set this whole thing up

25:35.659 --> 25:39.246
and he treats it like a side salad
at a steakhouse, and throws it away.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.668
I know you want to help him, Beau,
but it can be a long journey.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.670
Yeah, I get that.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.923
But he's not even willing
to take the first step.

25:50.423 --> 25:52.217
Dale went out on a limb for him.

25:53.176 --> 25:56.429
Y'know, Beau, he's gotta come
at this on his own terms.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.891
So until Luke is ready,
you're just gonna have to be patient.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.477
Maybe you're right.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.938
Being patient sucks.

26:07.190 --> 26:09.025
I'm gonna go fire a gun at something.

26:14.739 --> 26:18.034
So Hank, what do you like to do
besides hang out at the bar?

26:18.368 --> 26:20.495
Like to do or do?

26:29.629 --> 26:34.092
Hmm, look at this. One man, two drinks.
Hi, I'm Mary.

26:35.302 --> 26:38.221
Look at this,
an attractive woman talking to me.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.180
I'm Luke.

26:45.186 --> 26:48.023
Wait a minute, you don't have
a subpoena for me, do you?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.984
Uh-uh.
Do you have a search warrant for me?

27:00.660 --> 27:02.412
-Hey.
-[Beau] Hey.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.456
[groans]

27:06.916 --> 27:08.376
You watchin' CNN?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.380
Couldn't find the fuckin' remote.

27:18.261 --> 27:19.471
Wolf Blitzer.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.556
-What a waste of a good name.
-[Colt titters]

27:23.266 --> 27:24.351
Hell, boy.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.020
All right, Pop, good night.

27:27.103 --> 27:28.271
Good night, son.

27:31.107 --> 27:32.317
You drinkin' Coors?

27:34.486 --> 27:37.739
What gave it away?
That the can says "Coors"?

27:40.450 --> 27:42.994
Y'know, it's the same shit
as Keystone Light?

27:44.579 --> 27:47.415
They just charge you extra
for that fancy can.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.336
Didn't you already say good night?

27:54.089 --> 27:55.215
Holy shit!

27:55.840 --> 27:57.926
You're Coors and I'm Keystone.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.097
What?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.058
Fuck, okay, I got an idea.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.560
I already tried the tuner for your TV

28:07.644 --> 28:08.937
and it didn't work.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.815
-[Colt] No... Well...
-[Beau] Tthere you go.

28:11.898 --> 28:13.316
No, I...

28:13.400 --> 28:14.693
I need your help.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.152
Look...

28:16.236 --> 28:18.363
no one will give me a fair price
for my cattle

28:19.072 --> 28:20.448
'cause I'm a first-time rancher.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.369
But I bet they would if I sold them
under the Iron River name.

28:25.870 --> 28:30.333
I need you to help me
make my Keystone cows into Coors cows.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.088
Jesus, Colt.

28:35.547 --> 28:38.133
Peterson never got top dollar
for his cows.

28:42.095 --> 28:43.805
You don't know anything
about their history,

28:44.389 --> 28:45.265
their genetics.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.687
I've spent a lifetime
bringin' my herd along.

28:51.354 --> 28:54.190
I can stick my name on 'em
'cause I know what's in 'em.

28:55.233 --> 28:58.653
When they leave this ranch,
they're ready, the best I can make 'em.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.614
That's why the Iron River name
means something.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.325
[whispers] Dad...

29:05.535 --> 29:07.954
I wouldn't ask for your help
if I didn't need it.

29:10.248 --> 29:11.958
You can say I told you so...

29:12.834 --> 29:16.254
you can say I'm worthless,
you say whatever you want.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.299
But I need this.

29:20.884 --> 29:21.926
I can't do it.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.929
You can say whatever you want,
but not that.

29:30.226 --> 29:32.437
I told you to take
that Neumann's Hill deal.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.898
You didn't tell me
I was gonna get lowballed by everyone.

29:34.981 --> 29:37.108
You didn't want to hear what I had to say.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.235
You fought tooth and nail

29:39.319 --> 29:41.529
for me to let you run your own ranch.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.949
Asking me to sell your cows
is not running your own ranch.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.493
I'm running my own ranch.

29:47.243 --> 29:48.495
I'm doing the work.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.664
I need your help this one time,

29:51.748 --> 29:52.624
this year.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.003
When I bought this ranch there was nobody
around here to bail me out,

29:57.086 --> 29:58.880
and it made me a better rancher.

29:58.963 --> 29:59.964
You're a tough guy.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.383
You can sell your cattle under my name.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.637
It'll help you in the short term,
but in the long run, it'll only hurt you.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.097
You, your family, and your brand.

30:13.269 --> 30:14.562
So, you're not gonna help me?

30:15.939 --> 30:17.190
I am helping you.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.612
You only got one son left.

30:25.323 --> 30:26.449
You won't do this for me?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.286
For your granddaughter?

30:33.414 --> 30:34.374
[scoffs]

30:38.545 --> 30:40.046
I don't need your fuckin' help.

30:50.765 --> 30:51.599
[door shuts]

30:55.937 --> 30:57.605
Thought I saw the light on.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.024
Why are you still up?

31:03.319 --> 31:04.737
Just havin' a drink.

31:06.656 --> 31:08.658
-Peyton go down okay?
-Yeah.

31:08.741 --> 31:11.035
Yeah, your dad read her a book
to go to sleep.

31:12.078 --> 31:15.498
I couldn't find <i>Goodnight Moon</i>
so he read her a pamphlet from the NRA.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.837
[apes Beau] "That's how you maintain
a well-armed militia."

31:25.300 --> 31:26.551
You okay?

31:26.634 --> 31:28.428
Yeah, fine.

31:30.263 --> 31:32.974
Are you sure? It seems like
you got somethin' on your mind.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.189
I met with Ms. Neumann today
about that offer.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.442
Oh.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.694
How did that go?

31:47.822 --> 31:48.698
Great.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.408
We're all set.

31:51.117 --> 31:52.493
What... really?

31:54.203 --> 31:55.371
Buying the whole herd.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.541
-[Abby gasps]
-You don't have to worry anymore.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.753
That's great.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.172
That's great.
