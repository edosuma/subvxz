00:01.202 --> 00:06.540
**

00:06.607 --> 00:09.610
Ahhhhhh!

00:09.677 --> 00:10.911
[door opens]

00:10.978 --> 00:14.415
Miss Rarity? How much
longer are you planning

00:14.482 --> 00:16.684
to stay in here, darling?

00:16.750 --> 00:19.820
Oh, dear, is somepony
else waiting?

00:19.887 --> 00:22.423
No, no. I just don't
want you to get all,

00:22.490 --> 00:24.392
what is word, pruney.

00:24.458 --> 00:28.262
Oh. Well, I'm just waiting for
Applejack. It's been so long

00:28.329 --> 00:30.864
since we've had a relaxing
day at the spa together.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.033
I'm quite certain she'll be
along any moment.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.236
[door closes]

00:37.405 --> 00:39.340
[hiss of steam]

00:40.174 --> 00:41.542
[door opens]

00:41.609 --> 00:44.478
Hey, there, Rarity. I really
tried to get here earlier.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.447
I just can't believe how
much time my chores

00:46.514 --> 00:47.648
are taking up these days.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.717
At least now we'll
finally get to spend some

00:49.783 --> 00:52.520
quality spa time
together, right?

00:52.586 --> 00:56.390
OK fillies, that's it. We're
closing up for the day.

00:57.591 --> 01:01.362
Aw, shucks, Rarity. I guess
I missed the whole day.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.396
I sure am sorry.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.099
Me too.

01:09.403 --> 01:12.673
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:12.740 --> 01:14.608
* Aaaahhh *

01:14.675 --> 01:16.277
* My Little Pony *

01:16.344 --> 01:19.280
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:19.347 --> 01:21.048
* My Little Pony *

01:21.115 --> 01:23.551
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:23.617 --> 01:25.353
* Big adventure! *
* Tons of fun *

01:25.419 --> 01:27.188
* A beautiful heart! * *
Faithful and strong! *

01:27.255 --> 01:29.923
* Sharing kindness *
* it's an easy feat *

01:29.990 --> 01:31.925
** And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:31.992 --> 01:34.262
* To have my little pony *

01:34.328 --> 01:37.565
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:37.631 --> 01:39.667
**

01:44.838 --> 01:51.379
**

01:51.445 --> 01:52.480
Hi, Rarity.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.348
Morning, Twilight. Spike.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.185
Good heavens that's a
lot of empty pie plates.

01:57.251 --> 02:01.555
Uh, yeah. We were just heading
to pick up some fresh pies.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.724
I don't know why we keep
running out at the castle.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.695
What are you
going to get?

02:07.761 --> 02:08.996
Applejack,
actually.

02:09.062 --> 02:12.533
Although I'm quite sure
she'll be too busy once again.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.235
What do you mean?

02:14.302 --> 02:16.404
Oh, nothing. It's just
that Applejack and I

02:16.470 --> 02:18.939
haven't had one of our
spa days in ages.

02:19.006 --> 02:21.509
You two really should set
aside some time.

02:21.575 --> 02:24.512
Darling, I have been
trying for moons,

02:24.578 --> 02:27.981
but Applejack is so busy these
days, it's next to impossible.

02:28.048 --> 02:31.252
Wow. I didn't realize Applejack
had so much to do.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.390
[buzzer]

02:36.457 --> 02:39.460
**

02:46.033 --> 02:48.702
Hey, Applejack. Another
order of pies, please.

02:48.769 --> 02:49.837
Sure thing, Spike.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.642
Agh!

02:54.708 --> 02:56.777
I don't suppose those
pies are the last chore

02:56.844 --> 02:58.779
on the schedule for today?

02:58.846 --> 03:02.516
Gah! Land sakes! Is it time
for our spa day already?

03:05.319 --> 03:08.456
Rarity, why don't you go on
ahead and I'll meet you there?

03:10.391 --> 03:14.295
Ugh! Please, Applejack,
let's not kid ourselves.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.996
Well, it ain't 'cause
I don't wanna,

03:16.063 --> 03:18.432
but the work on the farm
has just been taking up

03:18.499 --> 03:19.733
more and more of my time.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.670
I hate seeing you two not
spending time together.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.505
Can't you get somepony
else in your family

03:24.572 --> 03:26.507
to take over for a bit?

03:26.574 --> 03:29.543
Wish I could, but Granny,
Big Mac and Apple Bloom

03:29.610 --> 03:31.845
all have chores of their own
and today they're all busy

03:31.912 --> 03:34.515
taking the harvest
to market.

03:34.582 --> 03:37.385
I know we're not farmers,
but I'm sure Spike and I

03:37.451 --> 03:39.487
could handle things
for a little while.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.721
Maybe.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.392
Is there one chore
we could do?

03:44.458 --> 03:47.595
Well...I suppose if
you two got started

03:47.661 --> 03:49.363
on feeding the pigs,

03:49.430 --> 03:51.732
I could maybe leave
for an hour.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.468
[squeal] An hour of
spa perfection?

03:54.535 --> 03:55.836
I can work with that!

03:55.903 --> 03:57.838
Perfect. You head
off to the spa

03:57.905 --> 03:59.907
and Spike and I will take
care of things here.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.575
Whoa! Ugh! Whoa!

04:03.844 --> 04:07.014
Uh yeah. We've totally
got everything covered.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.654
OK. This list pretty
much covers everything

04:13.721 --> 04:16.056
you need to know
to feed the pigs,

04:16.123 --> 04:20.694
but uh, maybe I should go
over it with you just to--

04:20.761 --> 04:23.697
Applejack, please, if
there's a list involved,

04:23.764 --> 04:26.534
I am one hundred
percent on top of it.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.901
Uh, right.

04:30.471 --> 04:31.939
And don't worry
about things here.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.675
Spike and I have
totally got this!

04:34.742 --> 04:38.546
I mean, it's just feeding
the pigs. How hard can it be?

04:38.612 --> 04:41.649
Uh... Twilight?

04:41.715 --> 04:43.451
Whoa!

04:43.517 --> 04:45.453
I'm glad we're
doing this, Rarity.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.088
I've been putting work before
our spa time for too long.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.790
I know we've only
got an hour,

04:49.857 --> 04:51.659
but I can't wait
to have a steam.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.427
A steam is just
the start.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.795
I know exactly
what we'll do

04:54.862 --> 04:57.631
and an hour will
be simply perfect.

04:57.698 --> 05:00.501
OK, Spike. Ready
with that list?

05:00.568 --> 05:01.602
Ready!

05:01.669 --> 05:03.471
Let's do this!

05:03.537 --> 05:05.305
Step one, open the gate.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.846
OK. Step two, close the gate.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.382
Huh?

05:14.448 --> 05:15.649
Mmm. That's what it says.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.887
Step three, walk away.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.922
Walk away? Really?

05:21.989 --> 05:22.890
[I don't know]

05:24.157 --> 05:25.859
I just hope Twilight and
Spike can handle things

05:25.926 --> 05:27.761
until I get back.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.996
Now, Applejack,

05:29.062 --> 05:31.765
if we are really to enjoy
this time together,

05:31.832 --> 05:34.001
you simply must give
yourself over to the idea

05:34.067 --> 05:37.805
that you are off duty
and try to relax.

05:37.871 --> 05:41.442
I know. You're right. I really
am glad we're doing this.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.577
And as long as
it's only an hour,

05:43.644 --> 05:46.079
I'm sure everything
will be just fine.

05:46.146 --> 05:51.018
Exactly. Now, kindly step
this way. Relaxation awaits.

05:58.892 --> 06:01.895
[gasp] Rainbow Dash?
What are you doing here?

06:01.962 --> 06:02.996
[giggle]

06:03.063 --> 06:05.098
Yeah. I didn't think
spa treatments

06:05.165 --> 06:06.867
were your thing exactly.

06:06.934 --> 06:07.901
What?

06:10.538 --> 06:12.773
Oh. They're totally not.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.642
At least, not the
"frou-frou" kind.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.209
Ah.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.179
Yeah, I-uh, I think
I tweaked something

06:19.246 --> 06:21.549
at Wonderbolts practice
the other day.

06:21.615 --> 06:24.752
I just came in for a deep
tissue sports massage.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.187
Ah, Miss Dash? I
am so sorry,

06:27.254 --> 06:29.957
but we are running
just a tad behind

06:30.023 --> 06:31.959
and we're not quite
ready to start your

06:32.025 --> 06:36.129
pampered muzzle massage and
indulgent hooficure just yet.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.802
Oh. [nervous laugh]

06:41.869 --> 06:44.171
I-I'm pretty sure that
wasn't what I signed up for.

06:46.707 --> 06:47.875
But they are your usuals-

06:47.941 --> 06:50.744
And it seems like you're
really busy today anyway.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.212
I'll just come back tomorrow.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.548
Uh, see you two
later. Have fun.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.684
But put me down for
the same thing.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.557
[chuckle] Too bad Rainbow
Dash just "hates" those

07:03.624 --> 07:05.893
"frou-frou" spa treatments.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.928
She could have joined
us for a nice steam.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.997
Whoo wee! I can't wait.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.701
[giggle] Indeed. Although if
they couldn't fit Dashie in,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.969
I wonder just how far
behind things are running.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.938
Obviously we're on a
very tight schedule.

07:20.974 --> 07:22.476
[grunt] [gasp]

07:28.716 --> 07:31.785
Well, maybe not everypony is
waiting for the steam room.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.922
Oh, no, no, that's exactly
what we're waiting for.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.690
Oh, I hope you're
not in a hurry.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.798
So every pony here
wants a steam bath?

07:44.865 --> 07:47.868
[all talking
affirmatively at once]

07:47.935 --> 07:49.803
Well, the solution
is obvious.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.039
We'll simply have to start
our short time at the spa

07:52.105 --> 07:53.306
with something else.

07:53.373 --> 07:56.243
Huh! Nothin' doin'! I
came here to have a steam

07:56.309 --> 07:57.945
and that's just
what I'm gonna get.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.813
But-but it will take
most of our hour

07:59.880 --> 08:01.982
just to get through
this line.

08:02.049 --> 08:08.088
Rarity! My favorite
customer![kisses]

08:08.155 --> 08:11.124
And Appleyack!

08:11.191 --> 08:14.294
Well, it certainly has been
a long time since you two

08:14.361 --> 08:17.965
were here together. So
lovely to have you back.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.001
Well, I wish I
could say the same.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.671
Yes, the wait time
for the steam room

08:23.737 --> 08:26.339
certainly has been
getting worse lately.

08:26.406 --> 08:29.209
But I'm sure we'll be
able to accommodate

08:29.276 --> 08:30.944
your usual treatments.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.080
Not without my steam.

08:33.146 --> 08:35.649
Apparently Applejack won't
consider starting her time

08:35.716 --> 08:38.285
at the spa without a steam
and we only have an hour.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.120
That is a problem.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.989
Applejack, where are you going?

08:44.257 --> 08:47.360
Um... Why are y'all
just standing here?

08:47.427 --> 08:50.798
Ugh! Just waiting for
the steam to build up.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.701
Without steam, a steam
room's just a room

08:53.767 --> 08:55.869
and I've got plenty
of those at home...

08:55.936 --> 08:57.571
because I live in a mansion.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.949
It has been taking longer
for the steam to reach that

09:09.016 --> 09:11.919
"Ponyville Day Spa" quality.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.956
We even had to add a
warm towel service.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.626
So sorry for the
delay, everypony,

09:18.692 --> 09:19.960
please help yourselves.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.639
So, if you're not
getting enough steam,

09:31.705 --> 09:34.207
that must mean there's
not enough hot water.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.943
Oh Applejack, honestly,

09:36.009 --> 09:37.811
can't we just start
with a hooficure?

09:37.878 --> 09:39.212
We're going to
run out of time!

09:47.788 --> 09:48.789
Hmmm.

09:48.856 --> 09:51.859
**

10:08.208 --> 10:10.410
Ha! Now, what do we have here?

10:10.477 --> 10:13.313
The laundry room, of course.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.348
And at this point, I'm
considering soaking my hooves

10:15.415 --> 10:18.218
in one of the machines so my
time here isn't a total loss.

10:18.285 --> 10:22.289
The Ponyville Day Spa prides
itself on sanitary conditions

10:22.355 --> 10:25.358
and fresh linens
are integral part.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.929
Well, sure, but have you
always run every single one

10:28.996 --> 10:31.965
of these here machines
full-bore, all day, every day?

10:32.032 --> 10:34.034
The answer is no...

10:34.101 --> 10:37.137
...but ponies sure do love
their warm towel service.

10:45.813 --> 10:46.880
Hmmm.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.964
You are all wanting towel?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.966
Looks to me like you
don't have any left.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.306
Well, like I said. Warm
towels are big hit.

11:22.549 --> 11:25.352
I think I figured
out the problem.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.955
You've got a small leak
and that means the steam

11:28.021 --> 11:30.223
takes just a little
longer to build up

11:30.290 --> 11:33.126
and while ponies wait,
they get cold.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.296
Cold ponies start wrapping
themselves in towels...

11:36.363 --> 11:39.532
...and all those dirty
towels have to be cleaned...

11:39.599 --> 11:42.702
...because Ponyville Day Spa
prides itself on cleanliness.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.910
Eh. What?

11:49.977 --> 11:53.213
Basically, losing steam
makes you use more towels.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.916
That means you do more laundry
which uses up the hot water

11:55.983 --> 11:57.885
you need to make more
steam so the problem

11:57.951 --> 11:59.820
just keeps getting worse.

11:59.887 --> 12:02.555
Oh.That makes sense. I see.

12:02.622 --> 12:05.458
Ah! I had no idea.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.693
Wonderful!

12:06.760 --> 12:08.962
Now that we've solved
the great steam mystery,

12:09.029 --> 12:11.264
we can finally get
back to our...

12:11.331 --> 12:15.168
significantly less than
an hour of relaxation.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.837
Rarity, are you kiddin'?

12:16.904 --> 12:19.339
I can't just leave
things like this.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.975
I'm gonna need my tools.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.043
Uh!

12:24.912 --> 12:27.915
* [country music] *

12:58.178 --> 13:00.113
Whoo! Now that
that leak's fixed,

13:00.180 --> 13:01.614
ponies won't get so cold

13:01.681 --> 13:04.952
they use up all those towels
and without all that laundry,

13:05.018 --> 13:07.087
there'll be plenty of hot
water for all the steam

13:07.154 --> 13:09.589
anypony could want.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.559
And I'll only have to be
doing wash once a day!

13:15.262 --> 13:18.866
Wow, Appleyack. Have you ever
considered a career

13:18.932 --> 13:23.103
in the spa industry? I'm sure
I can find something for you.

13:23.170 --> 13:27.207
[laugh] No thanks. I'm just
relieved I can finally relax

13:27.274 --> 13:30.077
in the steam. What do
you say, Rarity?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.379
Mmm. It sounds lovely,
Applejack,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.481
but unfortunately...

13:34.547 --> 13:36.616
...you spent so much time
fixing the steam room

13:36.683 --> 13:38.651
we don't have any time
left to use it.

13:38.718 --> 13:41.554
Honestly, how in Equestria
did it never occur to you

13:41.621 --> 13:43.390
to check for leaks?

13:43.456 --> 13:46.593
There's just so many other
things to worry about.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.196
I suppose we get used
to the way things are

13:49.262 --> 13:52.065
and we don't realize
there was problem.

13:52.132 --> 13:55.535
You obviously need an outside
eye to evaluate the situation.

13:55.602 --> 13:59.172
It's lucky for you Applejack
is too stubborn to relax.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.608
Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.676
We'll just have to
do this another day.

14:03.743 --> 14:06.213
Twilight and Spike should be
done feeding the pigs by now.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.082
Twilight is a very capable pony.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.684
I'm sure she can figure
out what to do next.

14:11.751 --> 14:15.088
Look, I know Twilight's a
princess and an alicorn,

14:15.155 --> 14:17.057
but she isn't a farmer.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.993
I've been doing farm work my
whole life and I'm not sure

14:20.060 --> 14:22.195
it's something you
can just figure out.

14:22.262 --> 14:26.566
Of course. [gasp] Why don't
we pop back so you can explain

14:26.633 --> 14:29.202
to Twilight what to do next
and then we'll come back here

14:29.269 --> 14:31.104
and pick up where we left off?

14:31.171 --> 14:34.274
Well, I suppose I could try,

14:34.341 --> 14:36.609
assuming everything
went well so far.

14:36.676 --> 14:40.013
Oh, Applejack, honestly!
[chuckle] How could it not?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.422
Wouldn't it be
easier to just fly?

14:49.489 --> 14:52.359
I told you, Spike, we're
following Applejack's list

14:52.425 --> 14:56.696
to the letter and Applejack
doesn't fly-- [grunt]

14:56.763 --> 14:57.965
Aaaaah!

14:58.365 --> 14:59.232
Whoa!

15:02.069 --> 15:03.003
[groan]

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
I'm sorry, Rarity,

15:09.309 --> 15:12.345
but I think I'm gonna have to
finish these chores myself.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.480
[growl]

15:18.585 --> 15:22.255
Twilight, darling, how in the
world did you end up there?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.424
Spike and I were just trying
to follow Applejack's list

15:24.491 --> 15:26.393
as closely as possible.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.096
Mmm...maybe not the best plan.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.363
I'm sorry, Applejack.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.267
But we never even got
started feeding the pigs.

15:34.334 --> 15:37.770
That's all right, Twilight.
I know you did your best.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.407
I guess a list can't really
capture all the ways I have

15:40.473 --> 15:42.442
of doin' things.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.312
At least you two got to spend
some time at the spa together.

15:45.378 --> 15:48.048
Yeah, that must have
been super relaxing.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.483
Well, if watching
Applejack fix plumbing

15:50.550 --> 15:53.353
counts as relaxing, then yes.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.722
What about your hour
of spa perfection?

15:55.788 --> 15:59.392
As it turns out, the Ponyville
Day Spa had a few problems

15:59.459 --> 16:03.063
with their steam room and
somepony refused to relax

16:03.130 --> 16:05.565
until she had fixed them.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.801
I'm sorry, but I just
couldn't let those spa ponies

16:08.868 --> 16:10.637
go another minute putting
up with problems

16:10.703 --> 16:13.306
they didn't even know they had.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.576
Somehow they just got used to
a huge bottleneck of ponies

16:16.643 --> 16:18.678
standin' around waitin'.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.747
But I took one good
look at that spa-jam

16:20.813 --> 16:23.183
and I knew I had
to do something.

16:23.250 --> 16:25.352
Sometimes the simplest
things can just derail

16:25.418 --> 16:26.519
a whole operation.

16:29.589 --> 16:32.325
Whether it's a leaky pipe
or doing too much laundry,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.727
you can't just stick to the
same old way of doing things

16:34.794 --> 16:36.329
and expect them to get better.

16:36.396 --> 16:41.201
[Chicken noises]

16:41.268 --> 16:46.206
I mean, thinking you can is
just plum ridiculous, right?

16:46.273 --> 16:49.442
[chuckle] It's funny when
you realize the extra work

16:49.509 --> 16:52.045
they were doing was actually
making things worse.

17:03.423 --> 17:06.126
I mean, I guess it's possible
to get stuck in a routine

17:06.193 --> 17:07.527
where you're doing all
this extra stuff

17:07.594 --> 17:08.728
and not realize it,

17:08.795 --> 17:11.664
but I can't for the life
of me think of how.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.500
Why are y'all starin'
at me like that?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.571
Um, are you certain
everything you just did

17:18.638 --> 17:21.508
is entirely necessary
to feed the pigs?

17:21.574 --> 17:26.546
What? Of course! Why would
I be doin' it if it weren't?

17:26.613 --> 17:28.581
See this gate here used
to squeak so loud,

17:28.648 --> 17:30.783
the pigs would run to the
other side of the pen

17:30.850 --> 17:32.018
and never come out,

17:32.085 --> 17:34.687
so I open and close it to
let them know it's safe.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.489
But it doesn't squeak anymore.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.327
Of course not. I
fixed that ages ago.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.330
Then I realized putting a
little fright into 'em

17:43.396 --> 17:45.598
got them all hustlin'
out of the pen.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.301
They don't look
scared to me.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.337
Well, no, they got
used to it.

17:51.971 --> 17:55.208
Which is why I started doing
the chicken dance to show 'em

17:55.275 --> 17:56.909
that if they didn't get to
eatin' their food,

17:56.976 --> 17:59.579
the chickens would.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.181
Of course, being a chicken,

18:01.248 --> 18:03.650
I couldn't very
well open the gate.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.585
Getting the food bucket to
spill into the trough

18:05.652 --> 18:07.287
was just a happy accident

18:07.354 --> 18:10.190
because one time I left
it there by mistake.

18:10.257 --> 18:13.260
Uh Applejack, it seems like
everything you're doing

18:13.326 --> 18:15.562
is to fix things that aren't
really problems anymore.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.500
Well, I'll be.

18:20.567 --> 18:22.702
Hm. Maybe it isn't so
hard to get stuck

18:22.769 --> 18:25.405
doing extra work after all.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.607
Huh, I wonder if I've been
doing that around here

18:27.674 --> 18:29.276
with anything else?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.678
Well, there's only
one way to find out!

18:31.744 --> 18:34.747
* [country guitar] *

19:59.332 --> 20:02.569
[sigh] Thanks y'all. I
guess I just got so used

20:02.635 --> 20:04.371
to doing everything
a certain way,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.773
I didn't realize there
were any problems.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.608
Having a friend look
at what you're doing

20:08.675 --> 20:10.943
with an outside eye
can really help.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.945
Um-hm. And I suppose
if it weren't for our

20:13.012 --> 20:14.881
unsuccessful time at the spa,

20:14.947 --> 20:17.350
none of us would
have realized it.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.919
Well, now that your
chores are streamlined,

20:19.986 --> 20:22.389
what are you going to do
with all the extra time?

20:22.455 --> 20:24.824
I think I have a few ideas.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.694
[sigh] Think you can come
up with enough things

20:27.760 --> 20:30.630
for us to do now that we have
more time to relax?

20:30.697 --> 20:34.334
Oh please, I could plan a
week's worth of treatments.

20:34.401 --> 20:35.935
Huh. Well, let's
just start with the

20:36.002 --> 20:37.637
rest of the day for now.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.806
After all the work we
just did on the farm,

20:39.872 --> 20:42.942
I am ready for some
serious relaxation.

20:43.009 --> 20:46.313
[sigh] Thanks for letting me
know there was an opening.

20:46.379 --> 20:48.415
I don't know if I could
make it without my

20:48.481 --> 20:49.849
pampered muzzle massage.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.584
Don't worry about it.

20:51.651 --> 20:53.986
Shall I put you down for
another one tomorrow?

20:54.053 --> 20:56.323
Oh, absolutely.

20:56.389 --> 20:59.726
Sometimes a girl just has to
pamper herself, am I right?

20:59.792 --> 21:01.728
Rarity: You
certainly are.

21:01.794 --> 21:07.434
[gasp] Oh. Oh! Hey! I
was just, uh, uh...

21:07.500 --> 21:12.372
Getting a "sports"
pamperin'? [chuckle]

21:12.439 --> 21:13.740
[giggle] Don't
worry, Rainbow Dash.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.042
We were just heading in for
some pampering ourselves.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.977
You could always join us.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.979
That is if you don't mind
suffering through

21:20.046 --> 21:22.649
one or two "frou-frou"
treatments.

21:22.715 --> 21:27.487
Ah, I suppose I could take
it. You know, for you ponies.

21:27.554 --> 21:31.023
[giggle]

21:31.090 --> 21:31.958
Applejack: Busted!
