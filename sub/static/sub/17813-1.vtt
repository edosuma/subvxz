02:57.000 --> 02:59.355
Marcy. Call Mr. Barnell.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.911
Tell him I picked up his wife again.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.752
I'm bringing her in.

03:40.560 --> 03:41.549
Need a hand?

03:43.080 --> 03:45.230
Oh, yeah. You mind giving her a push?

03:45.400 --> 03:46.071
Yeah.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.515
Oh, great. Thanks.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.199
- On three, then.
- Okay.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.234
One, two, three.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.195
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.550
I tell you, she may be fast,
but she sure ain't light.

04:00.720 --> 04:01.197
Yeah.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.959
You the new guy who just moved
into the Stevens' old house?

04:04.320 --> 04:07.835
No. Name's Ted.
What is that, a Polaris?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.069
Oh, yeah!

04:09.240 --> 04:10.719
What do those things go for?

04:11.320 --> 04:13.834
A lot more than I could normally
afford, I tell you.

04:15.880 --> 04:16.834
What's that?

04:18.240 --> 04:19.355
It's a video camera.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.392
- Hey, is that thing heavy?
- Yeah.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.152
And you got it in there by yourself?

04:24.160 --> 04:25.559
How's that on your back?

04:25.880 --> 04:26.790
Oh, no.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.878
Oh, please! Turn the camera off!

04:31.160 --> 04:34.311
Ted! Oh, that's not nice!

04:35.640 --> 04:38.837
That was really cool.
It was like watching "Cops".

04:39.080 --> 04:42.356
Yeah? Well, he was pretty spry
for a man with a herniated disk.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.878
You know, I don't want
to bitch or anything,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.434
but you were supposed to take
me along on that one.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.119
Couldn't find you.

04:49.240 --> 04:52.232
I know you know this but the sooner
they think I can handle things on my own,

04:52.400 --> 04:54.118
the sooner theyå€¤l kick
you back down south.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.073
Yeah, well, I've been hearing that for
thirteen months and six days, Cam.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.912
After a while, it gets a little old.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.672
Claims. Watters.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.075
Yeah. Okay.

05:23.401 --> 05:24.720
That's quite the fish.

05:27.721 --> 05:29.200
That one didn't get away.

05:29.321 --> 05:32.472
Yeah, well... it's a nice catch.

05:33.561 --> 05:35.916
This grasshopper walks in a bar.

05:36.081 --> 05:39.551
And the bartender says,
"We have a drink named after you. "

05:39.721 --> 05:40.631
And the grasshopper says...

05:40.801 --> 05:42.359
Paul Barnell.

05:42.481 --> 05:43.800
Ted Watters.

05:45.321 --> 05:45.992
Mr. Watters.

05:46.161 --> 05:47.037
Pleasure.

05:47.161 --> 05:48.037
Mine, too.

05:49.641 --> 05:53.839
Ted, Mr. Barnell would like to discuss
his brother's life insurance policy with us.

05:54.001 --> 05:55.514
- Raymond, right?
- Yes.

05:55.881 --> 05:58.759
Thing is, as I explained to Mr. Branch,

05:59.641 --> 06:01.438
he's been gone for five years

06:01.561 --> 06:06.077
and I thought, time to move on.

06:06.401 --> 06:08.119
By move on, you mean?

06:09.161 --> 06:10.037
I mean...

06:10.161 --> 06:12.800
I think that cashing Raymond's policy.

06:14.001 --> 06:17.391
I doubt, after that time,
that he's still alive.

06:17.721 --> 06:21.236
And my father always wanted us
to take care of each other

06:21.481 --> 06:23.676
if something should happen, and...

06:25.881 --> 06:27.599
money is a little...

06:27.881 --> 06:30.315
Yeah, I understand, Mr. Barnell.

06:30.481 --> 06:31.914
But here's the thing.

06:32.081 --> 06:35.756
With no actual body,
under Alaskan statutes,

06:35.881 --> 06:38.190
a person has to be missing
for seven years

06:38.321 --> 06:41.836
before he or she can be legally
declared dead.

06:42.001 --> 06:45.152
And that's not withstanding
an investigation period

06:45.321 --> 06:47.755
where concerned parties can take up
to another year

06:47.881 --> 06:50.918
to file interventions
concerning the motion.

06:51.081 --> 06:54.756
So, even though your brother's status
is undetermined at this point,

06:54.881 --> 06:57.076
there's really very little we can do for you.

06:58.321 --> 07:01.791
But we are extremely sorry for your loss.

07:03.641 --> 07:04.869
Absolutely.

08:25.481 --> 08:28.279
One, two, three...

08:31.401 --> 08:33.995
All right. We'll get him later.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.311
Yes, this is Mr. Barnell.

08:39.481 --> 08:41.073
Mr. Barnell, this is John Hoag again

08:41.241 --> 08:43.549
from Municipal Power's Delinquent
Accounts Department.

08:43.721 --> 08:44.039
Excuse me?

08:44.160 --> 08:45.196
I'm sorry, Mr. Barnell,

08:45.321 --> 08:48.154
I've tried every other option and,
frankly, this is unavoidable.

08:49.001 --> 08:50.195
Great.

08:50.401 --> 08:51.311
Excuse me?

08:51.721 --> 08:53.279
No, I'm not...

08:57.441 --> 08:58.157
Hello?

08:59.081 --> 09:00.753
Hello?

09:00.881 --> 09:02.837
Yeah. I paid that bill a week ago.

09:03.001 --> 09:03.558
You did?

09:03.721 --> 09:05.359
I saw my secretary write it up.

09:05.481 --> 09:07.790
Do you have any idea
where that payment might be?

09:07.921 --> 09:10.594
I have no clue.

09:10.721 --> 09:13.633
I'm a patient man, Mr. Barnell
but your credit rating is blocked off.

09:13.801 --> 09:15.632
I have a very good credit rating.

09:16.481 --> 09:17.550
No, you don't.

09:17.721 --> 09:18.631
How do you know that?

09:18.921 --> 09:21.879
I've got your TRW file in front of me, sir.

09:23.081 --> 09:25.879
Mr. Barnell?

09:29.321 --> 09:30.879
Mr. Barnell? Hello?

09:33.921 --> 09:34.910
Mr. Barnell?

10:55.722 --> 10:58.282
<i>Hey, kids, who's up for trout?</i>

10:58.402 --> 10:58.959
No.

11:47.162 --> 11:49.392
Jodie, no! Not for dogs!

12:56.562 --> 12:57.677
Honey, I'm home!

12:58.162 --> 12:59.072
Any mail?

13:06.882 --> 13:07.871
Psychic Pals.

13:08.642 --> 13:10.598
How are you today, Mr. Williams?

13:13.002 --> 13:15.641
Well, we are all registered psychics here.

13:15.802 --> 13:16.234
Hi, Tiff.

13:16.402 --> 13:19.758
I just had this feeling you needed to talk.
So what's up?

13:22.562 --> 13:24.553
Your TV remote control?

13:24.802 --> 13:28.033
Well, I need you to clear your
mind for a few moments.

13:29.722 --> 13:31.360
It's stew. I don't think it's still good.

13:31.482 --> 13:32.756
Hey, aren't you with a customer?

13:32.882 --> 13:33.837
They're concentrating.

13:34.002 --> 13:36.641
How is he the tea leaf business today?

13:36.802 --> 13:40.431
I've decided, from now on, to ignore you
and your ignorance about my work.

13:41.162 --> 13:43.198
And it's going very well, thank you.

13:43.322 --> 13:47.793
Mr. Williams? I'm seeing sofa cushions.

13:47.922 --> 13:51.961
Do you have a sofa?
Good! Glad I could help.

13:52.482 --> 13:55.315
Okay, before you say anything else

13:55.482 --> 13:58.042
that may keep us
from having sex ever again

13:59.002 --> 13:59.832
let me ask you something.

14:00.002 --> 14:01.515
No, I always get these wrong.

14:01.642 --> 14:02.711
That's why we keep trying.

14:02.882 --> 14:04.873
I don't want to do this.

14:05.482 --> 14:07.837
Love Is Sacrifice quiz.

14:08.002 --> 14:09.435
If you were in a life raft with me,

14:09.562 --> 14:11.518
and there was only enough water for one...

14:11.642 --> 14:12.870
No, I'm not going to do it.

14:13.162 --> 14:14.231
It's just a stupid quiz.

14:14.402 --> 14:15.312
Exactly.

14:16.162 --> 14:17.481
What is that?

14:18.562 --> 14:19.961
I was just kidding.

14:26.562 --> 14:27.756
Psychic Pals.

14:28.162 --> 14:30.118
Is this the first time
you've called us, Mrs...

14:30.242 --> 14:33.918
Stupid quizzes can be illustrative of
potential relationship problems.

14:34.403 --> 14:37.520
Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is
an anxious day for you.

14:37.643 --> 14:40.237
Hey, you know our only relationship
problem is that you're running a dollar,

14:40.403 --> 14:43.713
ninety-nine a minute carny scam
out of my living room.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.562
Don't call it a scam.

14:47.323 --> 14:49.518
Wait you didn't just call this
"your" living room, did you?

14:49.643 --> 14:50.553
Ours.

14:50.723 --> 14:55.274
Margaret, I feel someone you really care
about, maybe even the love of your life

14:56.723 --> 14:58.156
is being a real pain.

14:58.323 --> 15:02.236
Now, I need you to really concentrate
and I'll be right back.

15:05.883 --> 15:08.443
I thought stuff didn't smell
when it was frozen.

15:08.563 --> 15:09.791
I don't know why we have to...

15:09.923 --> 15:12.153
'Cause Dave wants visual confirmation.

15:12.403 --> 15:14.837
So Dave gets visual confirmation.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.555
We have a chance to move up here, Gary,
so let's just do what we're told.

15:19.723 --> 15:22.112
What's he gonna do, have him stuffed?

15:23.723 --> 15:26.556
Like the guy's not gonna end up
in a landfill anyway.

15:26.723 --> 15:28.634
You ever ask Dave what he did?

15:28.803 --> 15:29.633
Who knows.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.681
But Dave said if he did it one more time,
he was gonna break his neck.

15:36.563 --> 15:37.598
So how did it feel?

15:38.483 --> 15:41.077
I mean, not when you did it, but like now.

15:42.643 --> 15:44.156
I don't want to talk about it.

15:45.163 --> 15:46.118
Okay.

15:59.483 --> 16:01.872
Jimbo! He's not here.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.914
Gary, enough with the little jokes, okay?

16:04.483 --> 16:05.996
I'm serious. He's gone.

16:06.643 --> 16:09.521
Don't even joke about it.

16:09.723 --> 16:11.156
Maybe he wasn't...

16:12.243 --> 16:13.153
dead.

16:17.243 --> 16:20.201
Hey, Jimbo!
There's a little fridge down here.

16:35.243 --> 16:36.835
Morning, Mr. Barnell.

16:37.003 --> 16:37.640
Morning, Avis.

16:37.803 --> 16:38.519
Coffee?

16:38.803 --> 16:39.997
If you insist.

16:40.883 --> 16:42.032
She looks good.

16:42.643 --> 16:45.635
"Waikiki Airlines, your ticket to paradise. "

16:47.003 --> 16:49.039
Was last November this bad?

16:50.003 --> 16:52.676
If we didn't have the weather,
what would we talk about?

16:52.803 --> 16:53.360
Yeah.

16:58.723 --> 16:59.758
Messages?

17:00.163 --> 17:03.360
Just that fellow from Municipal Power
and Electric.

17:03.483 --> 17:05.314
I told him you sent the check in weeks ago,

17:05.483 --> 17:07.791
but some people don't like to listen.

17:07.923 --> 17:09.242
Sorry, what did you say?

17:13.163 --> 17:17.873
Avis, something really spooky
happened last night.

17:18.083 --> 17:19.835
You remember my brother Raymond?

17:20.083 --> 17:21.152
The one who went missing?

17:21.323 --> 17:26.113
Well, last night there
was a knock at the door

17:26.563 --> 17:28.758
and behold, there was Raymond
on my doorstep.

17:28.883 --> 17:30.396
Didn't you have him declared.

17:30.563 --> 17:33.635
Dead? Well, no... yes. Well,

17:33.803 --> 17:35.953
he wasn't gone long enough really for that.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.914
Good thing. In hindsight.

17:38.083 --> 17:40.551
So... where was he all these years?

17:41.483 --> 17:44.043
Lower forty-eight. Didn't like the cold.

17:44.163 --> 17:48.998
Well, that's great. You and Mrs. Barnell
will have some company for a bit, I guess.

17:51.163 --> 17:52.232
How is she?

17:52.403 --> 17:53.279
Better.

17:54.243 --> 17:55.881
A little better, you know.

18:01.403 --> 18:03.041
Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.

18:03.163 --> 18:06.553
Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.
I'll get my purse.

18:06.723 --> 18:09.191
It's twelve dollars.
I missed you last time.

18:09.323 --> 18:11.439
Jerk off. Jerk off.

18:11.883 --> 18:15.956
Jerk off. Jerk off, jerk off, jerk off.

18:22.243 --> 18:23.961
Tell your slut mom I said hi.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.641
Sure will. Thanks.

18:26.723 --> 18:28.634
Some days are better than others.

18:30.403 --> 18:31.313
Better.

19:30.404 --> 19:32.679
Paul, why is the fridge
in the garage chained shut?

19:32.804 --> 19:33.281
Possum.

19:33.404 --> 19:34.519
Hot pussy?

19:34.724 --> 19:36.282
Paul, dinner's almost ready.

19:36.404 --> 19:39.077
Oh, I feel like some wine.
You feel like some wine?

19:40.484 --> 19:43.760
You know, I have a crazy thought.

19:45.644 --> 19:46.918
Let's order in tonight.

19:47.084 --> 19:47.834
- Fuck it?
- Yeah.

19:48.004 --> 19:48.914
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:49.484 --> 19:51.554
You know and I have to talk to you
about something.

19:52.324 --> 19:53.439
Raymond's back.

20:17.884 --> 20:21.160
And here he is.
Well, what you say Bobbie Ray?

20:21.324 --> 20:23.884
Ray's a little jealous, just a little bit.

20:24.004 --> 20:27.963
Margaret! The one that got away.

20:29.404 --> 20:33.283
Beautiful signal on Margaret.
Lights on the deck.

20:40.884 --> 20:45.116
Good... good stuff. Hold on.

20:52.324 --> 20:56.795
Here's the Doctor.
It's time for my medicine.

20:58.564 --> 21:01.124
- That's okay. That's okay, okay,
- Let me get a towel.

21:01.244 --> 21:04.475
Don't worry about it.
I'd like the next one on the other leg, please.

21:05.804 --> 21:07.032
Good one, Margaret!

21:09.724 --> 21:10.713
Princess.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.394
Paul? Thank you so much
for clearing the driveway.

22:02.564 --> 22:04.361
That was real considerate.

22:04.484 --> 22:06.873
Well, I don't know what you're talking
about, Mrs. Wherry.

22:07.084 --> 22:09.200
You were out at the cabin this morning?

22:09.484 --> 22:12.078
Nice to see you getting
some use out of that thing.

22:12.244 --> 22:16.522
Oh, now I see. No, no,
that was Raymond you saw out there.

22:16.644 --> 22:17.599
He's alive?

22:17.724 --> 22:19.999
Yeah, very much.

23:59.085 --> 24:00.803
Oh, God. Come on!

24:03.725 --> 24:06.842
How much easier do I have to make this?

24:29.165 --> 24:31.042
Margaret, you scared
the wits out of me.

24:31.165 --> 24:32.075
Look at the dog.

24:32.925 --> 24:34.153
She's just a little puppy.

24:34.325 --> 24:35.201
A little puppy she is.

24:35.325 --> 24:36.121
Little hungry puppy.

24:36.245 --> 24:37.360
A hungry, hungry puppy.

24:37.485 --> 24:38.554
- Yes.
- Yes, she is.

24:38.725 --> 24:39.874
- Come on over here.
- Well.

24:40.005 --> 24:41.484
How late is Rudy's open?

25:15.165 --> 25:16.803
I'm sorry about this part.

25:22.005 --> 25:22.915
Thank you.

25:37.725 --> 25:40.842
If it's any comfort, he likely wasn't
eaten while conscious.

25:41.085 --> 25:42.916
So it was the fall?

25:43.725 --> 25:45.078
Did he say where he was living
before he came?

25:45.245 --> 25:45.882
Florida.

25:46.245 --> 25:48.042
He didn't talk about it much.

25:48.405 --> 25:49.838
He brought us this shell.

25:50.405 --> 25:54.557
It's all we have left, really.
Hadn't seen him for five years.

25:54.725 --> 25:55.999
We'd given him up for...

25:56.165 --> 25:57.803
For dead, yes, sir.

25:59.485 --> 26:00.713
How did you...?

26:00.885 --> 26:03.160
Anonymous phone tip
from some Jamaican... guy.

26:03.325 --> 26:03.996
Jamaican?

26:04.165 --> 26:05.996
He said he saw
what he thought was a body.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.042
We tracked you through his ID.

26:08.165 --> 26:09.518
Just like on TV.

26:10.645 --> 26:11.873
I have to see him.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.838
Mr. Barnell, I have to warn you,
an animal attack isn't pretty.

26:15.005 --> 26:15.801
I know.

26:15.925 --> 26:17.244
There's not much left.

26:19.085 --> 26:20.120
Oh, God.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.280
Is that your brother, sir?

26:23.405 --> 26:24.963
Yeah. That's him.

26:25.805 --> 26:27.443
Chewed his ears off.

26:28.405 --> 26:30.475
What kind of animal
does something like that?

26:31.005 --> 26:32.836
Normally, I'd say a bear.

26:33.405 --> 26:36.317
But with these tracks
and the feeding pattern, indicate wolf.

26:37.165 --> 26:39.281
It's rare, but it can happen.

26:48.805 --> 26:50.875
Your brother's personal effects.

26:51.645 --> 26:53.715
Marcy, would you...

26:53.885 --> 26:54.681
Yeah, no problem.

26:55.325 --> 26:56.474
Come on, let's go this way.

26:56.645 --> 26:57.157
Thank you.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.998
Coroner found some smaller bite
marks on the ankle.

27:01.165 --> 27:03.725
Pups. Must have been
the whole freaking pack.

27:03.885 --> 27:05.318
Derek found this.

27:06.885 --> 27:09.115
Not the smartest snack for a hiker.

27:10.485 --> 27:12.555
Messy animals, aren't they?

27:13.165 --> 27:16.840
Messy. Messy, messy, messy, messy.

27:17.005 --> 27:20.361
- Here ya go, say cheese!
- Cheese!

27:24.405 --> 27:25.838
Shit!

27:26.325 --> 27:28.759
You know, there are some places
on this planet

27:28.885 --> 27:30.716
where people actually do this outside.

27:34.485 --> 27:37.397
So how many insurance companies
are there in the United States?

27:37.565 --> 27:40.204
- Like a billion.
- That's not the point, Tiffany.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.281
That's not the point, Tiffany. I busted
my ass for Liberty Capital, all right?

27:42.405 --> 27:43.520
I don't want to quit.

27:43.885 --> 27:45.284
I want to be promoted.

27:46.005 --> 27:49.441
I want to be promoted
out of this icebound backwater.

27:50.925 --> 27:51.721
Okay.

27:51.925 --> 27:54.393
And when that happens,
I guess Iå€¤l just be another

27:54.565 --> 27:56.556
notch on your briefcase.

27:59.325 --> 28:01.043
I can't believe you just said that.

28:02.405 --> 28:07.923
Well, you know that you're the most
most important thing in my life.

28:08.485 --> 28:12.797
Sorry, what was that?
You wanna take me right here?

28:13.085 --> 28:16.122
Tiffany, what do you want...?

28:19.245 --> 28:20.280
You gonna get that?

28:25.926 --> 28:28.076
Psych... I'm sorry, hello?

28:28.246 --> 28:28.996
Who is it?

28:29.166 --> 28:30.076
Yeah?

28:30.646 --> 28:33.285
Look, is this a matter of life
and death? Because...

28:33.406 --> 28:34.361
Tiff, give me the phone.

28:34.886 --> 28:36.205
Yeah. Hello?

28:40.086 --> 28:41.121
You're kidding.

28:41.566 --> 28:42.442
Your mom?

28:44.326 --> 28:46.601
A million dollar life policy just checked.

28:48.086 --> 28:52.716
On a Saturday? What about the First
Annual Golf, Sex and Pizza Triathlon?

28:52.886 --> 28:54.001
Look, Tiffany, if this is who I think it is

28:54.166 --> 28:55.485
I may have found us
a ticket out of here, so...

28:55.646 --> 28:56.920
We don't need a ticket.

28:58.406 --> 29:00.237
Yeah, can I call you back? Okay.

29:01.486 --> 29:03.841
We... I mean...

29:04.486 --> 29:05.965
Don't be late, okay?

29:07.006 --> 29:08.485
You won't even know I'm gone.

29:16.566 --> 29:18.875
That's him. Raymond Barnell.

29:20.486 --> 29:23.046
So, what's your line on this?

29:23.326 --> 29:26.398
Just what it looks like. Wolves got him.

29:27.166 --> 29:28.997
Maybe a grizzly with insomnia,

29:29.166 --> 29:30.838
but I couldn't find any tracks.

29:31.726 --> 29:32.636
Well, would it surprise you to learn

29:32.806 --> 29:35.843
that his brother tried to cash
in his policy not two weeks ago?

29:36.006 --> 29:37.121
What are you trying to tell me

29:37.246 --> 29:39.396
that Mr. Barnell chewed off
his brother's leg?

29:39.566 --> 29:42.842
Well, doesn't it make you the least
bit suspicious that maybe...

29:43.006 --> 29:46.442
Mr. Watters, I don't know thing one
about insurance...

29:46.566 --> 29:50.639
but I'm guessing it's your job
to find a way not to pay these poor people.

29:50.806 --> 29:53.161
This is a nice, simple ending.

29:53.726 --> 29:56.559
We like nice, simple endings.

30:01.926 --> 30:05.362
Chief? Good news, bad news.

30:05.646 --> 30:10.356
The good news, he's dead.
Bad news, he disappeared.

30:10.566 --> 30:12.602
Proof, Jimbo. You got one week.

30:12.726 --> 30:13.602
It was our first time.

30:13.726 --> 30:15.682
Nobody gets it perfect their first time, Dave.

30:15.806 --> 30:17.125
Mr. Branch, this is not a standard case.

30:17.246 --> 30:18.884
You were there when the guy came in
and tried to cash in.

30:19.006 --> 30:20.564
I mean, come on. It stinks.

30:20.926 --> 30:24.839
Watters, if the police say
that this guy was...

30:25.006 --> 30:27.042
Eaten by wolves, sir.

30:27.166 --> 30:30.363
...eaten by wolves,
then we've got no case.

30:30.806 --> 30:33.923
Did you happen to see
Mr. Barnell on the news last night?

30:34.086 --> 30:35.758
The police told us what happened.

30:35.886 --> 30:37.444
How are you folks holding up?

30:37.566 --> 30:40.399
Well, my wife is too upset to be here.

30:40.566 --> 30:42.284
Paul? Who's out there?

30:42.406 --> 30:45.557
As I said, she's very upset.

30:45.726 --> 30:47.045
Paul? The door's stuck.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.965
It's tough, though,
'cause you have to ask yourself...

30:50.086 --> 30:51.963
Who fucked with the fucking door?

30:53.006 --> 30:55.076
You see how stressful his has been.

30:55.806 --> 30:58.525
I have to go now because
we have a service to plan. Excuse me.

31:01.166 --> 31:01.962
Hi.

31:02.806 --> 31:05.274
Well, what we don't need is bad PR.

31:05.406 --> 31:07.476
I don't want this thing Valdezing on us.

31:07.646 --> 31:09.079
Mr. Branch I'm sure that head office

31:09.246 --> 31:10.964
would take a rather dim view
of our approach to...

31:11.086 --> 31:14.522
Corporate's view will be what I tell them.

31:15.646 --> 31:16.681
Okay.

31:17.006 --> 31:21.238
Yes, sir. Color us "called off" as of now.

31:22.006 --> 31:24.759
Thanks, Cam. Thanks a lot.

31:25.166 --> 31:28.397
Thanks for, all the back up.

31:28.566 --> 31:31.285
You got a strange way of bucking
for a promotion, my friend.

31:32.326 --> 31:34.317
Look, I'm gonna start on the Johnson file.

31:34.486 --> 31:36.397
You wanna do up
the paperwork on Barnell?

31:39.566 --> 31:40.681
Where you going?

31:40.806 --> 31:41.556
Lunch.

31:41.806 --> 31:42.636
At nine-thirty?

31:42.806 --> 31:43.397
Yeah.

31:43.806 --> 31:45.398
We got seven joints here.

31:45.566 --> 31:48.797
We got a card place,
we got a Great Escape Travel, hair joint.

31:49.086 --> 31:51.156
Which one you figure'd
wanna take our friend?

31:52.886 --> 31:57.243
The police say they found Raymond's
wallet and that's how they tracked you down.

31:57.406 --> 32:00.478
- Yes, that's right.
- Any idea what he was doing out there?

32:01.246 --> 32:04.238
He'd take walks. Hikes.

32:05.086 --> 32:06.201
Hiking.

32:07.406 --> 32:08.555
How sporty.

32:09.486 --> 32:12.523
- Can I get you a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.125
Was he a big hiker?

32:16.086 --> 32:17.314
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

32:17.806 --> 32:21.082
Well, would he hike more than once
a week or was this just a one time thing?

32:22.566 --> 32:24.522
May I ask why you need to know all this?

32:25.006 --> 32:27.600
Just trying to tie up
some loose ends, Mr. Barnell.

32:27.886 --> 32:31.879
You know, the police they say
my brother died in the attack.

32:32.806 --> 32:35.274
Now, you do cover
that sort of thing, don't you?

32:35.406 --> 32:38.842
Yes, sir, Mr. Barnell, and it shouldn't
take more than a few days.

32:39.006 --> 32:42.794
Now, can you uh, can you tell me
a little bit more about your brother?

32:42.926 --> 32:43.881
The hiker?

32:58.486 --> 32:59.760
How is my princess?

33:04.807 --> 33:05.922
What's up?

33:07.167 --> 33:08.486
I took some Adavan.

33:11.407 --> 33:12.840
And called my psychic.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.156
You know we can't afford that.

33:14.327 --> 33:15.396
- We talked about that. Okay.
- Don't be mad.

33:15.567 --> 33:18.718
- It's just this week has been so...
- I know. I know.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.078
Well, with Raymond
getting eaten by animals

33:21.247 --> 33:23.158
and someone trying to steal the fridge.

33:23.647 --> 33:26.081
We got another letter from the HMO today.

33:30.087 --> 33:31.406
Hey, come on now. Come on.

33:34.927 --> 33:35.916
I'm sorry.

33:37.727 --> 33:39.797
Fucking cocksuckers.

33:44.007 --> 33:46.999
"As we previously stated
in the genetic history... "

33:47.167 --> 33:49.123
I'm sick. I'm really, really sick, you know?

33:50.927 --> 33:54.044
I know. "Tourette's Syndrome is not
easily diagnosed. No... "

33:54.167 --> 33:55.156
Fuck, fuck!

33:55.327 --> 33:58.683
"... onset before the age of 18
and no genetic history... "

33:58.807 --> 34:01.162
"Please reference
our previous discussions... "

34:01.327 --> 34:05.605
"... concerning you claims for... "
"... OCD, ODD, ADHP... "

34:06.927 --> 34:08.882
It's what's going down
at the beginning of the century.

34:09.007 --> 34:10.599
Margaret!

34:10.726 --> 34:11.637
But still in matters vegetable, animal
and mineral...

34:11.806 --> 34:13.445
I am the very model of a modern
Major-General.

34:13.567 --> 34:15.478
Margaret!

34:18.246 --> 34:20.397
I know you don't like to talk about this.

34:21.167 --> 34:23.886
But maybe it's not what
we think it is, you know?

34:24.487 --> 34:26.364
Yeah, maybe it's not.

34:26.487 --> 34:28.079
Maybe it's just stress.

34:31.647 --> 34:32.920
Remember that cruise?

34:35.806 --> 34:37.081
I saw you.

34:38.327 --> 34:39.476
You were happy.

34:42.567 --> 34:46.196
You were this sweet, happy person.
Kind and giving.

34:49.007 --> 34:51.123
I'm sorry. I'm tired, you know.

34:51.246 --> 34:55.478
They say you can't get it all of
a sudden, but I did. I really, really did.

34:55.647 --> 34:58.207
I know. I know.

34:59.887 --> 35:00.956
Well, I'll kill myself.

35:01.087 --> 35:02.440
No, come on, that's nonsense!

35:02.567 --> 35:05.001
- Then they'll see.
- No, that's nonsense talk. Come here.

35:05.167 --> 35:06.725
No, come on now.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.400
...marry someone normal.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.205
You're the most normal girl I know.

35:10.327 --> 35:12.443
I'm not crazy, Paul.

35:13.407 --> 35:16.240
- There's something wrong with me.
- I know, sweetie.

35:17.407 --> 35:21.958
And we're gonna find the best specialists
for what you have we can.

35:23.087 --> 35:24.600
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:26.247 --> 35:28.442
I know things are gonna turn around.

35:29.247 --> 35:33.638
Call me cra... I got this feeling. I do.

35:34.167 --> 35:36.806
But you have to leave everything
up to me, okay?

35:38.087 --> 35:39.805
You leave everything up to me,

35:40.807 --> 35:44.083
and you're gonna be okay. I promise.

35:58.327 --> 35:59.442
Shit bag.

36:02.007 --> 36:03.520
That's my girl.

36:10.007 --> 36:12.805
Yeah, hi. This is Ted Watters
from Liberty Capital.

36:12.927 --> 36:16.840
I was wondering if I could get a complete
credit workup on a Raymond Barnell

36:17.007 --> 36:21.159
and a Paul Barnell, as well.

36:21.647 --> 36:23.239
Yes, I will hold.

36:23.887 --> 36:25.320
You start the month ends yet?

36:25.487 --> 36:28.797
Oh, can you take care of that for me?
I'm kinda working on something here, Cam.

36:28.927 --> 36:31.600
Oh, God. You're not still
on the Barnell thing, are you?

36:36.647 --> 36:37.796
I went to go see him.

36:37.927 --> 36:38.723
And? And?

36:38.887 --> 36:42.163
So, trust me, something's not right.
I can smell it. Just help me buy a week.

36:42.327 --> 36:43.442
We're gonna get in such trouble.

36:43.567 --> 36:46.525
Okay, from now on, you can come along
with me on everything.

36:46.647 --> 36:50.276
No more Cam goes to the coffee room
and Ted disappears for three hours?

36:51.007 --> 36:52.201
I'll try, yeah.

36:52.327 --> 36:54.795
And you'll work on your interpersonal skills?

36:56.567 --> 36:58.239
- Yes.
- Good.

36:58.407 --> 37:01.558
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go start covering your ass.

37:02.407 --> 37:03.920
Oh, hi. Yeah, sorry.

37:05.567 --> 37:06.966
Are all these yours?

37:07.087 --> 37:08.486
Greatest sport on earth.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.082
Moved to a compound bow two years ago.

37:11.247 --> 37:13.044
Arthritis. Less draw weight.

37:13.887 --> 37:14.876
Tea okay?

37:15.007 --> 37:17.521
Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

37:17.647 --> 37:22.163
I was just wondering, did you happen
to talk to Raymond when he got back?

37:22.327 --> 37:25.603
Only saw him the once.
Never spoke to him.

37:26.087 --> 37:27.315
Waved to him.

37:28.327 --> 37:29.203
You waved?

37:29.327 --> 37:31.158
He was clearing my driveway.

37:32.087 --> 37:34.726
Raymond was a real hellcat
when he was younger.

37:34.887 --> 37:38.357
But like they say,
time mellows even the hardest soul.

37:38.568 --> 37:41.128
Was he much of an outdoo
rsman or ahiker or...?

37:41.248 --> 37:43.079
I thought it was Paul at first.

37:48.168 --> 37:49.760
Have you talked to Paul's wife?

37:50.408 --> 37:51.602
Now there's a story.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.288
Not that I'm much of a one for gossip,
but I think that...

37:54.408 --> 37:57.559
I'm sorry. Did you say you thought it
was Paul that did your driveway?

38:02.088 --> 38:04.477
Okay. It turns out that Mr. Barnell
is mortgaged to the nuts.

38:04.648 --> 38:07.162
His business is about one step away
from Chapter 11.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.444
Plus, it's like his brother Raymond
never even existed.

38:09.568 --> 38:10.603
There's no credit history,

38:10.728 --> 38:12.844
there's no nothing for the last five years.

38:13.008 --> 38:14.964
Plus the only thing he did
after his recent reappearance...

38:15.088 --> 38:18.842
was get some new ID and a new credit
card, but he didn't charge anything.

38:19.008 --> 38:21.044
Less than nothing.

38:21.648 --> 38:23.479
- Okay, well, it's something.
- No, it's not.

38:23.648 --> 38:26.879
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

38:27.928 --> 38:29.407
Claims, Watters.

38:30.088 --> 38:31.567
This is personal.

38:32.888 --> 38:34.037
I promise.

38:37.248 --> 38:40.399
Mr. Barnell, your ears must have been
burning. I was just...

38:41.248 --> 38:43.125
Oh, yeah, sure, yeah.

38:43.328 --> 38:44.477
What time?

38:45.808 --> 38:49.517
Why is God, who is a loving God,
capable of such things?

38:50.648 --> 38:54.687
When someone is taken from us at such
a young age, we often ourselves why.

38:54.808 --> 38:55.638
Bullshit.

38:55.808 --> 38:58.766
What possible purpose could this serve?

38:58.888 --> 39:02.927
But I believe the Apostle Paul,
writing to the Ephesians,

39:03.088 --> 39:07.878
said it best when he said
"All things are done according to God's will. "

39:08.008 --> 39:09.043
Nun banger.

39:13.488 --> 39:14.637
Doggies!

39:14.808 --> 39:16.844
Raymond Barnell, Barnell's Travel.

39:17.008 --> 39:18.600
We should have seen it earlier.

39:19.408 --> 39:21.876
We should have checked the funeral
announcements right away.

39:22.008 --> 39:24.806
Mr. Barnell, there was really no hurry
on this. I mean...

39:24.928 --> 39:26.202
we could've waited until later.

39:26.328 --> 39:27.477
We just wrapped up.

39:28.408 --> 39:29.921
This is my wife, Margaret.

39:30.088 --> 39:33.444
Sweetheart, why don't you go
sit in the car and warm up, okay?

39:33.568 --> 39:35.001
Okey dokey, Smokey.

39:39.408 --> 39:41.842
She's been under a lot of stress lately.

39:43.328 --> 39:44.920
I notice the media's here.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.522
They really don't give people
a moment's peace, do they?

39:50.808 --> 39:51.957
I called them.

39:54.808 --> 39:55.638
Really?

39:55.808 --> 39:57.639
They wanted to talk to me about Raymond,

39:57.808 --> 40:00.481
and I thought now would be
an appropriate time.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.798
And youå€¤l just happen to mention
your heartless insurance company

40:02.928 --> 40:04.202
that hasn't paid off your policy yet.

40:04.328 --> 40:07.126
I had to borrow money to pay
for this coffin, Mr. Ted.

40:07.248 --> 40:09.159
Well, you're breaking
my heart, Mr. Barnell.

40:09.328 --> 40:10.556
I doubt that.

40:14.568 --> 40:18.083
They asked to see some personal
photos of Raymond.

40:20.408 --> 40:22.717
Guess this is gonna be a really big story.

40:22.888 --> 40:24.480
Maybe if we walked over there together

40:24.648 --> 40:27.321
and you told them how deeply moved
you were by this tragedy.

40:27.488 --> 40:29.444
Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.

40:53.648 --> 40:57.561
Raymond left us this shell.
It's all we have to remember him by, really.

41:26.568 --> 41:27.887
Hello, little Bambi.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.037
Where's your mommy?

41:34.008 --> 41:36.476
Getting it from some ten-point buck.

41:38.408 --> 41:39.557
Yes, she is.

41:41.728 --> 41:44.242
She is...

42:43.489 --> 42:45.400
Stay away from our fucking appliances!

42:45.569 --> 42:47.639
Okay, lady, let's just stay calm.

43:14.089 --> 43:14.919
Sorry.

43:15.329 --> 43:17.320
Son of a bitch.

43:18.089 --> 43:20.045
You are in so much trouble!

43:20.409 --> 43:22.365
Lady, so help me...

43:26.649 --> 43:29.004
Let's go again. Let's go... again.

43:31.409 --> 43:32.444
Okay, sir...

43:33.249 --> 43:34.204
In the house!

43:46.169 --> 43:48.319
So you're a souvenir wholesaler?

43:48.489 --> 43:50.320
For the cruise ship trade, mostly.

43:50.489 --> 43:54.641
Usual stuff... stuffed animals.
You got your huskies, your moose

43:54.809 --> 43:56.606
your baby seals... your bears, your...

43:57.809 --> 43:59.003
Is that where they came in?

43:59.169 --> 44:01.763
Yeah, through that big hole in the roof.

44:03.009 --> 44:05.239
I got a list of all
the things that are missing.

44:13.009 --> 44:13.998
How much?

44:15.169 --> 44:17.046
We figure about two hundred grand.

44:17.169 --> 44:18.727
Plus fixing the roof.

44:18.889 --> 44:21.119
Fax over an estimate and we'll have
you a check by Friday.

44:21.249 --> 44:24.924
Ted? Maybe we should take
a look at the irinventory list first.

44:25.089 --> 44:27.159
This is a simple case.
Bad guys stole stuff.

44:27.329 --> 44:28.967
Let's just clear it and get going, okay?

44:29.089 --> 44:33.367
I should tell you, we also had some
VCRs we were holding for another company.

44:33.489 --> 44:35.366
That could run another couple grand.

44:36.489 --> 44:39.925
Wanna wrap this up, Cam?
Gotta go primary sometime!

44:50.649 --> 44:53.641
You try to rape me,
I swear to Christ, I'll bite it off.

45:00.249 --> 45:01.477
Hey, what's going on?

45:01.809 --> 45:03.879
- Don't ask!
- What the hell happened to your face?

45:04.009 --> 45:05.920
Jesus, you look like you ran into...

45:07.249 --> 45:10.161
So what now, you gonna get me
smoking from both ends?

45:13.889 --> 45:16.005
I just came here to look around

45:16.169 --> 45:18.319
and she started hitting me
and yelling at me.

45:18.489 --> 45:19.160
Oh, please.

45:19.409 --> 45:20.888
Is this how you solve our problem?

45:21.009 --> 45:23.364
I didn't have any choice.
Just listen to me, okay?

45:23.489 --> 45:26.322
Yeah, listen. If the fat from your neck
hasn't stopped up your ears.

45:33.089 --> 45:35.922
- Where would we stash her? Your place?
- No, it's too small.

45:36.089 --> 45:38.398
Plus, we'd have to get her in
and out without anyone seeing.

45:38.729 --> 45:40.924
And I've seen that sty
you call an apartment.

45:41.089 --> 45:43.603
You see, it's a bad idea.

45:49.329 --> 45:51.285
They got a whirlpool tub.

45:53.889 --> 45:55.163
With bubbles?

45:55.409 --> 45:57.240
It'd be like a little getaway.

46:10.729 --> 46:14.199
Hey Maggie Magster. You're awfully...

46:15.569 --> 46:16.763
What the hell happened?

46:18.889 --> 46:20.242
What the hell are you doing in our house?

46:20.409 --> 46:21.603
Mr. Barnell.

46:22.169 --> 46:24.729
I believe you have something that
belongs to us.

46:26.569 --> 46:28.082
I don't know what you're talking about.

46:28.249 --> 46:29.045
You don't?

46:29.649 --> 46:32.766
You hear that, Gary?
He don't know what we're talking about.

46:35.169 --> 46:36.887
Guess he doesn't know nothing about a...

46:37.009 --> 46:39.967
dead body in the dumpster
at his place of employment.

46:43.649 --> 46:45.082
So how much did you get?

46:48.889 --> 46:52.165
We had a life insurance policy
on my brother

46:52.329 --> 46:55.003
and we could get...

46:55.170 --> 46:57.206
one hundred thousand dollars.

47:00.090 --> 47:03.480
You know, it's always you quiet guys.

47:06.890 --> 47:10.041
All right, here's how it's gonna work.

47:10.810 --> 47:13.404
We stay here with your little tulip in there

47:13.730 --> 47:15.129
and you go get our guy.

47:16.890 --> 47:18.642
You stay here?

47:18.810 --> 47:22.200
Have the body and let's say

47:23.490 --> 47:26.641
fifty thousand clams for our trouble.

47:26.890 --> 47:30.929
You screw with us and we'll start mailing
your wife back to you.

47:36.810 --> 47:38.641
Starting with her feet.

47:58.490 --> 48:01.402
Paul! Are you moving in?

48:02.010 --> 48:03.409
Just for a bit.

48:03.570 --> 48:05.606
She'll come to her senses.

48:05.730 --> 48:07.163
They always do.

48:08.490 --> 48:09.969
Thanks, Mrs. Wherry.

48:12.170 --> 48:13.080
Good night.

48:29.730 --> 48:30.924
Oh, Raymond.

48:31.410 --> 48:34.288
Would it have killed you
to clean up before you left?

49:19.730 --> 49:21.049
State police! Open up!

49:21.570 --> 49:23.481
Police? Is there something wrong?

49:34.250 --> 49:36.810
Hello, brother. Missed ya.

49:41.170 --> 49:42.728
Page sixteen, Paul.

49:43.410 --> 49:45.970
You know what I love about USA Today,

49:46.090 --> 49:50.083
other than the bar graphs
and the colored pictures?

49:50.250 --> 49:53.606
They got news from every state
in the Union.

49:54.330 --> 49:57.720
I was eaten by wild fucking animals!

49:58.490 --> 50:02.927
But you know, despite that,
I'm feeling pretty goddamn chipper.

50:03.170 --> 50:05.479
Let me tell you
what's going on here, Raymond.

50:07.090 --> 50:09.888
So where's my money?

50:10.010 --> 50:13.889
Your money? There's no money yet.
They're still investigating.

50:14.250 --> 50:15.319
What'd you get?

50:16.090 --> 50:17.489
Fifty thousand.

50:17.930 --> 50:19.363
I get half.

50:19.650 --> 50:20.526
Sure.

50:23.330 --> 50:25.241
You look good. You lost weight.

50:25.730 --> 50:27.846
I gave up carbs.

50:28.730 --> 50:32.200
I'm getting a health kick.

50:35.890 --> 50:37.687
What you doing out here, anyway?

50:39.010 --> 50:40.409
She not going along with it?

50:40.930 --> 50:42.409
Who, Margaret?

50:43.490 --> 50:45.720
How's she holding up, anyway?

50:46.730 --> 50:48.288
We're having problems.

50:50.090 --> 50:51.205
Any kids?

50:52.490 --> 50:55.482
You still can't get one past the goalie, huh?

50:57.930 --> 51:02.640
Well, it's best not to send
a boy to do a man's job.

51:04.650 --> 51:06.527
So how come you talk like you do?

51:06.930 --> 51:09.398
I mean, cursing all the time.

51:09.730 --> 51:12.039
It's a disease.
It's called Tourette's Syndrome.

51:12.170 --> 51:15.287
I can't control what I say. Turnip.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.126
Really?

51:17.250 --> 51:18.285
Congratulations.

51:18.890 --> 51:21.404
You've just kidnapped
a handicapped person.

51:21.730 --> 51:26.042
I saw on TV where people
with that don't usually curse.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.569
They must have got it wrong.

51:27.730 --> 51:28.799
I don't think so.

51:28.930 --> 51:31.843
It was a movie of the week
based on real events.

51:32.731 --> 51:35.768
And don't people
with Tourette's usually twitch and stuff?

51:39.891 --> 51:42.359
I get it. Sorry. You got a spice rack?

51:43.891 --> 51:47.440
Next to the stove.
What's that supposed to mean?

51:47.571 --> 51:49.050
Nothing. Cumin?

51:50.411 --> 51:52.402
There. There. There.

51:52.571 --> 51:56.564
There, there, there, there, there, there!

51:57.011 --> 52:00.287
And I'm not crazy.
It's a physical disease.

52:00.411 --> 52:02.242
Sometimes I can control it,
and sometimes... I can't.

52:02.411 --> 52:05.130
You can't. You know what I think?

52:05.651 --> 52:09.530
I think this syndrome is something you
read about somewhere and figured...

52:09.651 --> 52:11.482
"Hey, works for me. "

52:11.651 --> 52:12.970
Ass. Ass. Ass.

52:13.091 --> 52:16.447
You can completely abdicate
your societal responsibilities.

52:16.571 --> 52:19.643
Say whatever want whenever you want,
and slough it off on an illness.

52:19.811 --> 52:21.005
Ass-rimming ball sucker.

52:21.171 --> 52:22.968
Maybe I should catch this thing.

52:23.091 --> 52:24.729
"Gee, sorry, Your Honor,

52:24.891 --> 52:27.200
I have this disease that makes me
rob 7-Elevens.

52:27.331 --> 52:29.481
It's called I really need a Slurpee disease. "

52:29.651 --> 52:33.087
You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life
you shit-eating fuck-weasel.

52:33.251 --> 52:35.640
What kind of a man threatens a woman
with a gun, anyway?

52:35.811 --> 52:37.563
You are so faking it.

52:37.731 --> 52:38.959
You should know.

52:39.891 --> 52:41.483
Is this how you get your kicks,

52:41.651 --> 52:44.643
you overcompensating
pussy little fart sack?

52:44.811 --> 52:48.724
You better shut your mouth
or I'm gonna stick this gun right in it!

52:48.891 --> 52:50.688
You don't scare me. If something bad
was gonna happen,

52:50.811 --> 52:52.244
my psychic would have told me.

52:53.891 --> 52:55.688
You put that down now, you little bitch,

52:56.011 --> 52:59.367
or so help me I'll start yelling
so loud, you'll have to shoot me.

53:12.811 --> 53:14.085
A little help here?

53:16.811 --> 53:18.130
I got Twinkies.

53:27.811 --> 53:28.687
Honey?

53:30.731 --> 53:31.766
You okay?

53:32.331 --> 53:35.528
Wait, this is the important part.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

53:36.571 --> 53:37.560
This stops now.

53:37.731 --> 53:38.402
I was watching that.

53:38.571 --> 53:41.131
This case is making me and you crazy.

53:41.251 --> 53:42.320
Especially you.

53:44.811 --> 53:46.961
I'm just trying to be supportive.

53:47.491 --> 53:51.450
Leading experts agree that's the number
one complaint men had about their mates.

53:51.731 --> 53:55.201
I don't have any complaints about my, you.

53:57.731 --> 53:59.050
Dead guy's got a record?

53:59.171 --> 54:01.924
Yeah, he beat some guy
up in a bar fight.

54:02.091 --> 54:03.968
He broke the guy's eye socket.

54:10.571 --> 54:11.970
- Honey?
- Yeah.

54:12.091 --> 54:13.922
- I think you should look at this again.
- Okay.

54:29.491 --> 54:32.688
You know, I've been thinking there, Paulie.

54:34.731 --> 54:38.280
After we get her back
from these guys who grabbed her

54:38.451 --> 54:41.682
do you think your wife's
gonna be able to keep her

54:41.811 --> 54:43.642
pretty little mouth shut?

54:43.811 --> 54:45.483
That'd be a first.

54:46.771 --> 54:48.841
'Cause, you know,
crazy people talk a lot and...

54:49.011 --> 54:50.285
- She's not...
... and I'm told that

54:50.451 --> 54:54.160
if you say something to your therapist,
they can use that in a courtroom.

54:54.331 --> 54:56.049
We can't afford a therapist, Raymond.

54:56.211 --> 54:59.726
Still, you just might want to think about it.

55:01.011 --> 55:02.160
Think about what?

55:02.931 --> 55:04.603
All I'm saying is,

55:04.731 --> 55:08.201
sometimes a man has
to make problematic decisions.

55:08.371 --> 55:11.920
Cull the herd, so to speak.

55:18.971 --> 55:22.281
Come on, Paulie, I'm just
I'm just fuckin' with you.

55:22.411 --> 55:23.844
Don't be such a stick.

55:24.011 --> 55:26.047
Is that jailhouse humor?

55:27.931 --> 55:29.603
Still...

55:46.331 --> 55:47.081
Mr. Watters.

55:47.651 --> 55:50.882
On the phone you said something
about a resolution to our claim?

55:51.051 --> 55:52.962
Mr. Barnell, why are you staying out here?

55:53.771 --> 55:58.686
My wife and I we're having
a few problems.

55:58.851 --> 56:01.240
Well, that's kind of understandable,
seeing as how you killed that man

56:01.411 --> 56:03.447
and dumped his body out
in the middle of the woods.

56:03.611 --> 56:04.361
Raymond?

56:04.531 --> 56:05.566
No, no, no.

56:05.731 --> 56:06.686
Definitely not Raymond.

56:06.851 --> 56:09.924
I thought it was at first,
but that's what was throwing me.

56:10.092 --> 56:12.003
I don't think I appreciate your tone, sir.

56:12.172 --> 56:17.121
My tone?
Mr. Barnell, you are going to jail.

56:17.292 --> 56:18.407
I will personally see to that.

56:18.572 --> 56:19.448
I think you should go now.

56:19.612 --> 56:22.206
You are a liar and a thief!

56:22.332 --> 56:23.048
Mr. Watters, I've had a very rough night.

56:23.212 --> 56:23.644
Murderer.

56:23.812 --> 56:24.164
No.

56:24.292 --> 56:25.725
You are a murderer.

56:33.132 --> 56:34.645
What happened to your eye?

56:35.892 --> 56:38.167
Let's say you just step away from him.

56:42.252 --> 56:43.685
You all right there, Paul?

56:44.172 --> 56:46.288
I'm all right, Mrs. Wherry. It's okay.

56:46.452 --> 56:48.602
I can drop him, if you want.

56:48.772 --> 56:50.922
No. I'm all right.

56:53.612 --> 56:56.445
I think you should go.
She can't hold the bow that long.

57:07.452 --> 57:10.444
I got some fishing line,
if you want me to stitch that.

57:14.412 --> 57:15.322
You okay?

57:16.292 --> 57:19.762
Yeah. I'm great.

57:24.212 --> 57:25.645
I haven't called the police yet,

57:26.172 --> 57:28.322
but I can tell you it was certainly tempting.

57:28.972 --> 57:33.682
In my life, I've had dealings
with diseases of the mind and...

57:34.572 --> 57:36.608
he is definitely disturbed.

57:37.492 --> 57:40.404
Watters, it's so good of you to join us.

57:40.532 --> 57:44.286
Mr. Barnell was just telling me
about the last meeting you had.

57:45.692 --> 57:47.045
I caught that, yeah.

57:47.172 --> 57:51.324
And, as you can see,
Mr. Barnell has some concerns.

57:53.492 --> 57:55.642
You don't think I did this.

57:59.212 --> 58:03.842
- I would never...
- His neighbor says otherwise.

58:07.252 --> 58:09.686
Mr. Branch, can I show you something?

58:09.852 --> 58:12.605
I think you would like to see it, too,
Mr. Barnell.

58:15.772 --> 58:18.605
Okay, see? Where's the birthmark?

58:19.332 --> 58:20.321
Your brother's police report listed,

58:20.492 --> 58:22.210
"large, purple birthmark, upper right thigh".

58:22.372 --> 58:24.044
But I don't see it here, not on this body.

58:24.212 --> 58:28.285
You can-you can see it here,
in the-in the picture. See?

58:28.972 --> 58:30.963
So where did it go?

58:31.132 --> 58:34.727
Did it just disappear? Did it all of
a sudden get better, Mr. Barnell?

58:42.812 --> 58:44.962
It did get better, Mr. Watters.

58:45.132 --> 58:46.247
It did?

58:46.412 --> 58:47.606
It got better!

58:48.372 --> 58:50.761
Well, how in the world did that happen?

58:51.492 --> 58:57.647
Well... Raymond, when he came back
from Florida,

58:57.812 --> 58:59.245
he'd had it fixed.

59:00.412 --> 59:04.485
Laser surgery. Yeah, how like
you remove a tattoo.

59:04.932 --> 59:06.047
I understand.

59:06.212 --> 59:07.725
And it gone.

59:11.732 --> 59:13.643
He did... not! No! He didn't!

59:13.812 --> 59:14.483
What do you mean? Did not.

59:14.652 --> 59:17.564
How can you tell? There's no leg!

59:17.692 --> 59:22.925
You taped my brother's body
in a morgue. And this! What's this?

59:23.172 --> 59:25.242
You stole family pictures!

59:25.412 --> 59:29.485
You videotaped the naked chewed
corpse of my little brother!

59:29.612 --> 59:32.285
What the kind of sick company
are you running here, sir?

59:32.452 --> 59:35.524
This is crazy! This is crazy!

59:35.652 --> 59:39.042
All we have to do is dig up the body
I'm not talking to you!

59:39.172 --> 59:42.289
Dig up the body and check
for laser scars! Dental records!

59:43.292 --> 59:48.161
- All right. All right!
- All right. All right!

59:51.692 --> 59:57.688
Mr. Barnell, I'm so very sorry
that it's come to this.

59:57.852 --> 01:00:00.844
We will have a check brought to you first
thing in the morning.

01:00:06.132 --> 01:00:07.087
Thank you.

01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.681
Jesus. Thank God he's not suing us.

01:00:25.572 --> 01:00:29.008
Tomorrow, you will deliver a check
to Mr. Barnell

01:00:29.172 --> 01:00:31.686
with a complete apology.

01:00:33.612 --> 01:00:36.206
Mr. Branch, I know how this looks...

01:00:36.372 --> 01:00:39.603
It looks like you beat hell
out of a policy holder!

01:00:39.732 --> 01:00:41.245
Now, send Cam in here.

01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:43.966
While you've been out on
your little Easter egg hunt,

01:00:44.132 --> 01:00:47.967
your junior found us a way out
on that warehouse robbery.

01:00:48.453 --> 01:00:51.365
Head Office is going to bump him a level.

01:00:55.813 --> 01:00:56.768
I'll go get him.

01:00:58.773 --> 01:01:01.287
Head Office is very keen on him.

01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:05.564
They've asked me
to feel him out about a transfer.

01:01:08.613 --> 01:01:11.764
County Coroner.
It's a Disinterment Order.

01:01:12.293 --> 01:01:14.966
Hello. Yes, I was wondering
if you could tell me

01:01:15.133 --> 01:01:17.522
which department is in charge of...

01:01:19.133 --> 01:01:20.248
Sure, I'll hold.

01:01:21.093 --> 01:01:23.129
Hang on, Mag Pie. Hang on.

01:01:47.053 --> 01:01:50.602
Listen, you little prick!
We want what's coming to us!

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:57.928
I know you are, but what am I?

01:01:58.093 --> 01:01:59.048
Gary!

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:00.970
Gary!

01:02:01.133 --> 01:02:02.043
Your turn to deal with it!

01:02:02.213 --> 01:02:03.726
If I come out of this bathroom,

01:02:03.893 --> 01:02:06.202
I swear to God I'll put
a fucking bullet in her head!

01:02:06.373 --> 01:02:08.204
I know you are, but what am I?

01:02:09.173 --> 01:02:12.404
Ray. Can I talk to you for a moment?

01:02:13.093 --> 01:02:14.367
Ladies.

01:02:14.533 --> 01:02:15.363
Ladies.

01:02:19.773 --> 01:02:20.683
Listen, who's...?

01:02:21.013 --> 01:02:21.763
The prostitutes?

01:02:21.933 --> 01:02:23.685
I sure as hell hope so.

01:02:23.813 --> 01:02:27.567
'Cause Jehovah's Witness won't lick your lolly
no matter how much you pay them.

01:02:27.973 --> 01:02:29.122
How'd you get them here?

01:02:29.293 --> 01:02:32.285
I just put it on my plastic.

01:02:32.413 --> 01:02:36.326
It's got my name on it and everything.
"It's everywhere that we want to be. "

01:02:36.573 --> 01:02:39.087
You can't use this.

01:02:39.253 --> 01:02:42.165
No, no, no. Think. Okay? Ray?

01:02:42.973 --> 01:02:44.565
You're not using your head, Raymond.

01:02:44.733 --> 01:02:47.122
The fuck you say.

01:02:52.133 --> 01:02:54.442
What in blazes is that on the counter, Ray?

01:02:54.653 --> 01:02:57.247
That's "muh gun", Paul.

01:03:02.693 --> 01:03:03.364
Hello?

01:03:03.493 --> 01:03:06.166
Hello, Mr. Barnell. It's Jimbo.

01:03:06.293 --> 01:03:07.442
Sorry, I can't...

01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:09.205
Are you having a party?

01:03:09.493 --> 01:03:12.405
There's no party.
Put my wife on the phone.

01:03:12.573 --> 01:03:14.291
- Sir, that's not right.
- Now! Please.

01:03:14.453 --> 01:03:17.843
- Thirty, sorry, starting now!
- I have to talk to my wife.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:21.563
Well, he wants to talk to her.
Okay, hold on.

01:03:21.733 --> 01:03:22.404
Twenty-five!

01:03:22.573 --> 01:03:24.006
Paul, are you entertaining?

01:03:24.173 --> 01:03:26.846
Oh, Margaret, no!
Oh, God, Jesus, are you all right?

01:03:27.013 --> 01:03:28.969
Fifteen! Have you got the body?

01:03:29.133 --> 01:03:30.248
Paul, we need more chips!

01:03:30.413 --> 01:03:31.243
Have you got the body?

01:03:31.413 --> 01:03:33.324
Paul, the carrot little weasely one
wants to carrot screw me

01:03:33.493 --> 01:03:34.005
with his sick carrot little cock.

01:03:34.173 --> 01:03:36.687
And he's messing up my kitchen.
Cock, cock, cock, cock...

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.246
You sick you don't hurt her!

01:03:38.413 --> 01:03:42.008
I didn't say anything like that.
I didn't. Ten seconds! Yes or no?

01:03:42.173 --> 01:03:43.367
Paul, where's the chips?

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:48.567
Yes. You'll have it tomorrow.
Now put my wife back...

01:03:50.533 --> 01:03:51.124
Hello!

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:53.569
I think I managed to avoid a trace.

01:03:54.573 --> 01:03:56.689
We're staying in his house.

01:03:58.973 --> 01:03:59.849
Right.

01:04:00.813 --> 01:04:02.849
Hello! Can I help you?

01:04:04.013 --> 01:04:04.968
Mr. Watters.

01:04:05.493 --> 01:04:08.530
Mr. Barnell, I...

01:04:08.853 --> 01:04:10.969
I have your check.

01:04:11.853 --> 01:04:12.603
Really?

01:04:13.093 --> 01:04:13.923
Yeah.

01:04:15.573 --> 01:04:19.088
Thank you very much.
I appreciate that. Please sit.

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.163
Avis.

01:04:29.893 --> 01:04:30.962
Did you have an accident?

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:33.848
Well, no, actually I was mugged.

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:37.769
The police say it was just
a random act of violence,

01:04:37.933 --> 01:04:40.208
but who knows, right?

01:04:44.773 --> 01:04:49.324
I have to get you to sign right here
where I marked

01:04:49.493 --> 01:04:53.884
an X. And...

01:04:55.413 --> 01:04:58.246
I'd like to apologize for...

01:04:58.413 --> 01:05:00.927
No. No, please. No need.

01:05:06.533 --> 01:05:08.205
Well, that's quite the shell.

01:05:09.333 --> 01:05:10.925
It's a gift from my brother, Raymond.

01:05:11.573 --> 01:05:15.646
He brought it back from Florida for me,
and now it's all I have to remember him by.

01:05:16.933 --> 01:05:18.844
Well, that and a million dollars.

01:05:21.813 --> 01:05:24.044
Boy, things really worked out for you
this time, didn't they?

01:05:24.214 --> 01:05:26.444
- Lots of cash. Newly single guy...
- I'm not single.

01:05:26.614 --> 01:05:27.683
Well, what are you gonna do?

01:05:27.854 --> 01:05:29.765
You gonna go down to Club Med
and see how much a big bankroll can buy?

01:05:29.934 --> 01:05:30.684
Maybe get some hookers?

01:05:30.854 --> 01:05:32.685
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.

01:05:35.254 --> 01:05:36.323
Very much.

01:05:40.294 --> 01:05:46.563
Can we level with each other
for a moment? How... how did...

01:05:46.734 --> 01:05:47.564
Avis!

01:05:50.654 --> 01:05:51.450
Avis!

01:05:54.694 --> 01:05:55.843
I got it.

01:05:56.254 --> 01:05:57.528
A second. Thank you.

01:06:06.054 --> 01:06:08.124
That's where you went!

01:06:16.334 --> 01:06:17.926
That's quite the display.

01:06:18.494 --> 01:06:21.247
They do some very nice
in-store promotions.

01:06:22.454 --> 01:06:24.206
Here it is, Mr. Barnell.

01:06:24.454 --> 01:06:26.843
I thought someone
might have walked out with it.

01:06:27.014 --> 01:06:28.527
It's not the best neighborhood.

01:06:35.454 --> 01:06:38.127
Sign right by the X.

01:06:56.494 --> 01:06:59.566
Avis, will you call Municipal
Light and Power

01:06:59.734 --> 01:07:02.089
and tell them I'll be dropping by in a bit?

01:07:06.294 --> 01:07:07.124
Thank you.

01:07:31.174 --> 01:07:33.005
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:37.008
A lot of people find talking
to a psychic very therapeutic.

01:07:37.454 --> 01:07:39.445
So what's on your mind, Carlos?

01:07:40.174 --> 01:07:43.610
I have a situation. My wife...

01:07:45.374 --> 01:07:48.969
Do you think it's okay to do
something kinda bad to someone

01:07:49.374 --> 01:07:54.528
even though they may do something
to someone else that's really bad?

01:07:55.494 --> 01:07:59.646
Well, you probably shouldn't break
the law, if you can help it.

01:07:59.774 --> 01:08:03.084
Are you really sure
they're gonna do this other thing?

01:08:04.054 --> 01:08:07.285
He said some things.
He said he was joking,

01:08:07.414 --> 01:08:10.565
but I think he might do them.

01:08:10.734 --> 01:08:13.407
Okay, well, don't think, know.

01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:15.485
How close are you
to this other someone else,

01:08:15.654 --> 01:08:17.167
the one you're trying to protect?

01:08:22.493 --> 01:08:24.291
Have you ever felt like

01:08:25.573 --> 01:08:27.804
like your own life didn't even matter

01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:30.725
as long as

01:08:31.894 --> 01:08:33.407
Listen to me Carlos.

01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:37.243
Your wife is an incredibly lucky woman.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.006
I know relationships are tough,

01:08:39.174 --> 01:08:42.849
but you you just do what you gotta do
to keep it together, okay?

01:08:43.254 --> 01:08:46.769
Remember, love is sacrifice.

01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:54.966
I guess you're right.

01:08:56.054 --> 01:08:58.249
Okay, so you get tough, all right?

01:08:58.654 --> 01:09:01.850
And remember, this call is
for entertainment purposes only.

01:09:02.254 --> 01:09:04.609
But call me back and let me know
how it goes, okay?

01:09:05.014 --> 01:09:06.765
- Okay.
- All right.

01:09:16.054 --> 01:09:16.691
Okay.

01:10:22.815 --> 01:10:26.649
So, Miami, huh?
Can you believe that?

01:10:26.775 --> 01:10:29.209
One little case and, boom,
you're the flavor of the month.

01:10:29.815 --> 01:10:32.727
Congratulations. Why are you here?

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:35.688
To say thanks.
If you hadn't given me a shot on that...

01:10:35.855 --> 01:10:38.528
Oh, no, no, no.
Forget about it. I'm trying to.

01:10:39.095 --> 01:10:42.610
So, we were all kinda wondering,
what did happen to your face?

01:10:43.015 --> 01:10:44.084
Car trouble.

01:10:46.855 --> 01:10:47.685
Should you be driving?

01:10:47.855 --> 01:10:48.810
Absolutely not.

01:11:20.175 --> 01:11:20.971
Jodie!

01:11:32.895 --> 01:11:34.487
We set for the switch tomorrow?

01:11:34.615 --> 01:11:35.491
Yeah.

01:11:35.655 --> 01:11:39.330
There's a turnout up at Summit
Hill where the snowmobilers park.

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.848
Fine.

01:11:50.335 --> 01:11:52.007
You guys like it?

01:11:55.055 --> 01:11:56.647
Tastes like a rectal polyp.

01:12:01.455 --> 01:12:03.730
Now, how would she know?

01:12:07.295 --> 01:12:08.728
How would she know?

01:12:11.375 --> 01:12:12.728
How would she know?

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:17.004
I coulda had her, you know?
We both know that.

01:12:17.935 --> 01:12:18.765
Right?

01:12:23.895 --> 01:12:27.729
Oh, yeah, yeah, I just figured she was...

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:32.447
I don't know. You know?
'Cause I... You know?

01:12:32.575 --> 01:12:33.928
No, I don't know.

01:12:34.335 --> 01:12:36.485
- Okay.
- You ready for a refill?

01:12:36.655 --> 01:12:38.964
Does Mrs. Kennedy have a black dress?

01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:44.206
- Alrighty.
- Comin' up.

01:12:48.655 --> 01:12:51.408
So, rendezvous
at the glacier tomorrow, huh?

01:12:51.535 --> 01:12:53.765
First thing in the morning.

01:12:56.175 --> 01:12:59.690
Yeah, well, we'll go get her
and do the thing, and...

01:13:02.815 --> 01:13:05.887
You remember that time in school

01:13:06.055 --> 01:13:10.287
when I jumped out and scared you
and you fucking peed all over yourself?

01:13:10.415 --> 01:13:11.928
That was a hoot, yeah.

01:13:13.015 --> 01:13:14.368
Hey, bottoms up.

01:13:15.175 --> 01:13:21.569
Okay. Puddles! You remember
how everybody called you "Puddles"?

01:13:21.815 --> 01:13:23.692
Everybody called you "Puddles".

01:13:23.855 --> 01:13:24.810
They did.

01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:26.325
Puddles!

01:13:26.495 --> 01:13:27.928
Yeah, that was funny.

01:13:29.175 --> 01:13:30.767
Hey, come on now.

01:13:31.055 --> 01:13:33.489
There you go, there you go.

01:13:37.495 --> 01:13:39.008
I love you, bro.

01:13:39.175 --> 01:13:40.324
You too, pal.

01:13:42.215 --> 01:13:42.965
Okay.

01:15:35.336 --> 01:15:36.849
It's my tub! Open up!

01:15:37.016 --> 01:15:37.846
Finders keepers.

01:15:38.016 --> 01:15:39.608
No, I drew the water! Get out!

01:15:39.776 --> 01:15:41.687
- Finders keepers.
- Get out of here.

01:15:42.376 --> 01:15:44.287
You know this thing has twelve
different settings?

01:15:44.456 --> 01:15:48.608
No, Gary I don't. Every time I try to get
in it, somebody else is already there.

01:15:48.776 --> 01:15:50.289
Stop that!

01:15:50.856 --> 01:15:53.051
Hey, let me ask you something.
Does this look normal?

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:54.490
Oh, Christ!

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:57.210
I read that if it changes color,
you should have it looked at.

01:15:57.336 --> 01:15:59.008
Yeah... but not by me!

01:16:11.536 --> 01:16:12.207
Hello?

01:16:12.336 --> 01:16:14.406
Oh, thank fucking Christ! Is Tiffany there?

01:16:14.656 --> 01:16:17.728
No, well, she's gonna be
back in a couple of minutes.

01:16:17.896 --> 01:16:19.488
Do you want to call back later?

01:16:19.656 --> 01:16:20.850
Well, you should know, fuckwit.

01:16:21.016 --> 01:16:23.325
Do you know there's a man with a gun
in my bathroom right now?

01:16:23.496 --> 01:16:24.690
Goddammit, Ted.

01:16:24.856 --> 01:16:27.768
Oh, wait, yeah, she's right here.
One second.

01:16:28.176 --> 01:16:29.450
Mrs. Barnell?

01:16:31.376 --> 01:16:33.207
I'm here, Margaret.
How're you feeling today?

01:16:33.376 --> 01:16:34.126
Give me the headset.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:35.769
What is wrong with you?

01:16:35.936 --> 01:16:37.767
Christ! Where do you want to start?

01:16:37.896 --> 01:16:39.966
Mrs. Barnell could you speak up a bit?

01:16:40.136 --> 01:16:41.171
What's she saying?

01:16:41.336 --> 01:16:44.567
Something about the Gay Mafia taking
her to a park to kill her?

01:16:45.376 --> 01:16:48.925
Margaret, now are you sure
that these are real people in your house?

01:16:50.176 --> 01:16:51.245
Shit on toast.

01:16:52.376 --> 01:16:54.367
Jesus! Fucking dog.

01:16:54.536 --> 01:16:56.128
Watch out for Jodie.

01:16:57.536 --> 01:16:59.766
How do you like the bubbles now?

01:16:59.936 --> 01:17:01.608
You want to squeak your duck again?

01:17:03.176 --> 01:17:03.926
Jesus!

01:17:08.576 --> 01:17:10.532
- That really hurts, you know?
- Good!

01:17:17.296 --> 01:17:18.649
Why are the flowers talking?

01:17:23.016 --> 01:17:23.926
Are you sure this is it?

01:17:24.096 --> 01:17:26.610
She specifically mentioned
the cocksucking turnout off the highway

01:17:26.736 --> 01:17:28.772
where the snowmobilers like to hang out.

01:17:30.216 --> 01:17:31.331
I'll call you later, okay?

01:17:32.216 --> 01:17:33.729
I won't be here.

01:17:33.896 --> 01:17:34.567
Excuse me?

01:17:35.936 --> 01:17:38.848
I know relationships aren't gonna be
all sunshine and roses,

01:17:39.016 --> 01:17:41.086
but I'm not really having
that much fun anymore,

01:17:41.256 --> 01:17:42.928
and I don't think you are, either.

01:17:43.696 --> 01:17:44.970
What are you talking about?

01:17:45.336 --> 01:17:47.486
I just I think you need to be
like this right now,

01:17:47.656 --> 01:17:50.170
and I'm not in a good space to deal with it.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:53.252
So, what?

01:17:55.976 --> 01:17:59.127
I just, I don't think we should be
like this together.

01:18:34.816 --> 01:18:36.090
Psychic Pals.

01:18:37.976 --> 01:18:39.967
How are you today, Mr. Williams?

01:18:42.456 --> 01:18:44.970
I think she'd be fine with you re-marrying.

01:18:47.936 --> 01:18:49.767
But hang on, let me concentrate...

01:18:58.576 --> 01:19:00.692
I've been... I've been cutting
you out of my life

01:19:01.576 --> 01:19:05.888
and, as a result, our normal communication
channels have been blocked.

01:19:06.056 --> 01:19:07.967
And I think that you coming with me

01:19:08.456 --> 01:19:11.448
would further the development
of our relationship

01:19:11.736 --> 01:19:15.046
and allow us both to realize the...

01:19:15.216 --> 01:19:18.527
the potential of our interpersonalism.

01:19:18.737 --> 01:19:20.807
If you're gonna be sarcastic...

01:19:20.977 --> 01:19:22.569
I'm not being anything.

01:19:27.817 --> 01:19:30.331
Okay. Why do you want me to come?

01:19:33.537 --> 01:19:34.731
Because if you don't,

01:19:35.657 --> 01:19:38.410
then... then I'll have to stay.

01:19:39.937 --> 01:19:42.770
And then, then I'll be mad about that.

01:19:45.937 --> 01:19:47.768
And then, and then I know that

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.167
we'll eventually break up over it.

01:19:55.497 --> 01:19:57.567
And as bad as my life is right now, Tiffany,

01:19:57.737 --> 01:19:59.534
that would make it a million times worse.

01:20:08.337 --> 01:20:09.611
Mr. Williams?

01:20:10.297 --> 01:20:12.208
You know, she's totally cool with it.

01:20:12.337 --> 01:20:15.090
Listen, listen, you're gonna
have to call back.

01:20:15.657 --> 01:20:17.613
I gotta go help my boyfriend.

01:21:35.977 --> 01:21:39.128
See this? This has all the symptoms of
that Tourette's thing...

01:21:39.297 --> 01:21:40.730
and you don't have half of them.

01:21:40.857 --> 01:21:41.448
And?

01:21:41.617 --> 01:21:43.733
And... and you're faking it.

01:21:43.897 --> 01:21:45.569
Magazines don't prove anything.

01:21:45.697 --> 01:21:47.972
Could we please get there
e in some peace and quiet?

01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:49.809
Magazines prove everything.

01:21:49.937 --> 01:21:51.609
Don't make me pull the car over.

01:22:00.337 --> 01:22:02.089
Okay, so it's called The Listening Game.

01:22:02.257 --> 01:22:05.488
You talk, I listen,
and I can't interrupt. Then we switch.

01:22:05.897 --> 01:22:07.171
I can talk about anything?

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:09.412
Yes.

01:22:10.097 --> 01:22:11.849
Let's just drop it, okay?

01:22:12.017 --> 01:22:15.566
I'm just saying, she acts like this
'cause you always take her side!

01:22:21.097 --> 01:22:23.167
That little prick!

01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:56.089
I assume you have our friend?

01:22:56.217 --> 01:22:58.526
Of course. Can you let her go now?

01:22:58.937 --> 01:23:00.529
Let's see our guy first.

01:23:05.617 --> 01:23:06.572
How do we know it's him?

01:23:06.737 --> 01:23:08.568
Come on!
Where would I get another one?

01:23:09.857 --> 01:23:11.131
You got the money, Mack?

01:23:15.937 --> 01:23:18.690
So, this is kinda like a really weird
"Law and Order" episode.

01:23:18.817 --> 01:23:20.728
And if Paul Barnell already
killed his brother...

01:23:20.897 --> 01:23:22.410
Yeah, maybe his wife is next.

01:23:25.537 --> 01:23:26.970
Okay, so my turn?

01:23:27.097 --> 01:23:27.847
Yeah.

01:23:27.977 --> 01:23:29.171
Now, a healthy relationship...

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:30.372
Here we are.

01:23:37.417 --> 01:23:38.247
Can I let her out?

01:23:38.417 --> 01:23:40.612
No! Step away from the car!

01:23:53.377 --> 01:23:54.447
Why did you gag her?

01:23:56.058 --> 01:23:57.093
You know.

01:24:15.698 --> 01:24:19.373
- It's all over. Did they hurt you?
- No, no, no...

01:24:19.538 --> 01:24:21.130
You don't look so good.
Have you been eating?

01:24:21.258 --> 01:24:23.089
- Yeah, I've been. You? Did they feed you?
- Did you drink too much coffee?

01:24:23.258 --> 01:24:24.691
No, you know, when I get busy. You know.

01:24:24.858 --> 01:24:25.688
Did you fall?

01:24:25.818 --> 01:24:28.332
- Yeah, but... Chipped a tooth.
- We'll fix that when we get home.

01:24:29.258 --> 01:24:30.611
Boy, you look good.

01:24:32.058 --> 01:24:33.207
You smell nice.

01:24:33.378 --> 01:24:34.652
- Yeah.
- Musty.

01:24:35.098 --> 01:24:36.167
How's Jodie?

01:24:36.338 --> 01:24:37.248
She's dead.

01:24:38.218 --> 01:24:39.094
Kidding.

01:24:42.018 --> 01:24:43.007
Pretty good.

01:24:43.938 --> 01:24:45.212
So, do you have a plan here?

01:24:45.338 --> 01:24:46.851
You know, I guess I'm gonna

01:24:47.338 --> 01:24:49.488
I'm gonna go talk to him.

01:24:50.578 --> 01:24:53.570
- Yeah. You don't mind staying here, do
- Sure.

01:24:53.738 --> 01:24:55.694
Wait. When do we call the cops?

01:24:57.738 --> 01:25:03.529
You know, I mean, if he is doing
something then, Iå€¤l just,

01:25:04.498 --> 01:25:06.216
I'll wave, okay?

01:25:10.578 --> 01:25:12.296
That's a very good plan.

01:25:19.098 --> 01:25:20.247
Tourists.

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:26.771
- Wait isn't... isn't that?
- What?

01:25:28.058 --> 01:25:31.289
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:25:37.658 --> 01:25:39.410
Aren't you Raymond Barnell?

01:25:39.738 --> 01:25:40.773
Go away.

01:25:41.098 --> 01:25:42.690
Hey, you know, I don't really know
what's going on here,

01:25:42.818 --> 01:25:44.695
but I was just wondering if maybe
you could come with me to my office

01:25:44.858 --> 01:25:46.530
just for a few minutes. I mean...

01:25:47.978 --> 01:25:49.969
Hey, man, you know,
I don't wanna screw with your life,

01:25:50.098 --> 01:25:51.770
but you can't just walk away
with a million dollars

01:25:51.898 --> 01:25:54.014
and expect people to be like,
"Hey, yeah, thanks a lot pal. "

01:25:59.418 --> 01:26:00.692
How much?

01:26:04.378 --> 01:26:09.532
Your brother,
and I use this term very carefully

01:26:09.978 --> 01:26:13.891
has stolen a million doll
ars from my insurance company...

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:20.287
For years I've been thinking new meds...

01:26:24.378 --> 01:26:25.731
You know, maybe we should...

01:26:30.258 --> 01:26:36.288
Honey, I need you to walk over to that
big hill behind me, okay? Okay?

01:26:36.618 --> 01:26:40.770
Why don't you put this on now, okay?
I want you to get warm, all right?

01:26:41.938 --> 01:26:42.529
You look so good.

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:46.088
No matter what you hear
what you hear,

01:26:46.258 --> 01:26:48.169
you just keep walking, all right?

01:26:48.338 --> 01:26:51.614
If I'm late or something...

01:26:51.778 --> 01:26:52.733
You're never late.

01:26:52.938 --> 01:26:55.054
...look inside the coat.

01:27:12.098 --> 01:27:12.974
Jimbo?

01:27:22.938 --> 01:27:24.929
Million dollars, Paul?

01:27:26.378 --> 01:27:30.007
Did you really think
you could take me? Again?

01:27:30.298 --> 01:27:31.890
What million dollars?

01:27:32.098 --> 01:27:33.372
Fuck.

01:28:32.859 --> 01:28:35.612
What the fuck!
She didn't have anything to do with this!

01:28:35.739 --> 01:28:36.808
And you do.

01:28:40.619 --> 01:28:42.735
Put it down, Nancy.

01:28:42.899 --> 01:28:44.252
You first, chief.

01:28:45.459 --> 01:28:48.690
You win, tough guy.

01:28:53.539 --> 01:28:54.289
Gary.

01:28:54.819 --> 01:28:55.934
Sorry.

01:28:58.739 --> 01:29:00.172
It was an accident!

01:29:00.579 --> 01:29:03.093
- What the fuck, man?
- It wasn't me!

01:29:03.219 --> 01:29:03.890
Gary!

01:29:04.219 --> 01:29:05.652
Please don't shoot us!

01:29:06.339 --> 01:29:10.696
Stop! What the fuck, Gary? Jesus Christ!

01:29:10.859 --> 01:29:11.689
No!

01:29:21.579 --> 01:29:23.615
Oh! Oh, God!

01:29:37.219 --> 01:29:39.289
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

01:29:39.459 --> 01:29:42.371
Oh, fucking hell. I can't breathe.

01:29:54.219 --> 01:29:55.208
Can you stand?

01:29:55.379 --> 01:29:56.448
Is the Pope a...

01:29:56.619 --> 01:29:57.290
Easy.

01:30:05.179 --> 01:30:06.055
Thank you.

01:30:46.419 --> 01:30:48.933
You're gonna kill me, Gary.
Gonna kill me.

01:31:26.739 --> 01:31:28.491
Look at me, you little...

01:31:38.099 --> 01:31:39.088
Puddles.

01:32:20.339 --> 01:32:21.454
Where do you think you're going?

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:22.688
Ted, leave him alone!

01:32:22.859 --> 01:32:24.531
No, no, no, no!

01:32:26.659 --> 01:32:29.253
No, I've been beaten!

01:32:30.099 --> 01:32:31.976
I've been humiliated!

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:35.290
He kicked me in the balls!

01:32:35.939 --> 01:32:37.895
He kicked me in the balls!

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:40.931
And I want an answer now!

01:32:41.459 --> 01:32:42.209
Okay.

01:32:45.739 --> 01:32:48.333
Well, go ahead.
I can still kind of hear out of this one.

01:32:54.459 --> 01:32:56.211
I love my wife, Mr. Watters.

01:32:57.979 --> 01:32:59.890
And when you love someone

01:33:01.059 --> 01:33:03.334
I mean, really love someone...

01:33:03.499 --> 01:33:04.488
That's it!

01:33:05.619 --> 01:33:07.894
Fuck! If I wanted a Hallmark card

01:33:08.059 --> 01:33:10.972
or the lyrics to a Foreigner rock ballad,

01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:14.775
I would go to the mall, Mr. Barnell!
The Listening Game.

01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:35.533
Mr. Barnell... you can go first.

01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:56.013
Habeas corpus.

01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:00.575
I wanted to help Margaret, you know?

01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:02.813
I'm broke

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:06.370
and that's why I came in originally
with that insurance policy thinking,

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:08.934
"I can do this. You'll pay off. "

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:13.093
'Cause, you know,
I hadn't seen Raymond since...

01:35:05.500 --> 01:35:06.296
Where do you want to go?

01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:07.336
Someplace close.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.536
My three o'clock was moved up.

01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:12.056
So you all right about everything?

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:15.009
Yeah.

01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.573
Good. Good.

01:35:16.700 --> 01:35:18.691
I like it when you're okay.

01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:25.291
Don't you just love this weather?

01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:28.489
Learning to.

01:35:29.305 --> 01:35:35.662
