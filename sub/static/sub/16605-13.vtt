Hmm.

an older model of some
type of protocol droid.

to give it enough power

The droid appears to be
counting down?

14:03.710 --> 14:05.710
(BEEPING)

14:05.712 --> 14:07.712
Counting down to what?

14:07.714 --> 14:12.383
Most likely it has
activated its Imperial
anti-capture fail-safe.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.186
There's probably
a proton warhead inside too.

14:15.188 --> 14:19.057
If you're right,
then this droid could vaporize
the entire base

14:19.059 --> 14:21.726
and us along with it.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.663
The countdown timer
has already begun.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.599
ZEB: How much time
have we got left?

14:29.068 --> 14:30.368
Twenty seconds.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.637
(GROANS) Any ideas?

14:32.639 --> 14:33.738
(GRUNTS)

14:34.573 --> 14:35.640
(WHOOSHING)

14:36.375 --> 14:38.476
ZEB: What did he do?

14:38.478 --> 14:41.379
He's temporarily frozen
the countdown circuit.

14:41.381 --> 14:45.316
That should buy us time
to move the droid to
a safe distance from the base

14:45.318 --> 14:46.985
before it detonates.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.420
This part will require
some manual labor.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.189
Your specialty,
I believe.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.690
Wait.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.693
Fulcrum said if this droid
doesn't report back
to the Empire,

14:55.695 --> 14:57.729
they'll come here
looking for it.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.397
Oh, wait.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.734
Are you suggesting
we allow it to return
to the Empire,

15:02.736 --> 15:05.603
with a memory bank
filled with rebel secrets?

15:05.605 --> 15:09.240
Well, we can't
let it detonate.
We can't let it go back.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.576
Think, Zeb, think!

15:12.544 --> 15:14.612
This might take a while.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.949
(SIGHS) Can you get inside
the droid's programming?

15:17.951 --> 15:19.751
I believe I can.

15:19.753 --> 15:22.053
I want you
to wipe its memory.

15:22.055 --> 15:24.589
No, its memory core
is protected.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.725
Any attempt to tamper
with it would likely
trigger detonation.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.961
Nor can I disarm
the warhead.

15:29.963 --> 15:33.064
One way or another,
it is going to explode.

15:33.066 --> 15:35.133
It's just a matter of when.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.969
Or a matter of where.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.139
What if we send it
back to the Empire
still ticking?

15:41.141 --> 15:43.474
Can you make an adjustment
to the warhead,

15:43.476 --> 15:44.876
set it to restart
the countdown

15:44.878 --> 15:47.612
when the droid reconnects
to the Imperial network?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.581
Possibly.
What are you suggesting?

15:50.583 --> 15:52.550
We let it go back
to its base,

15:52.552 --> 15:55.486
but it blows before
it can upload its data.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.389
Maybe even takes some more
of these droids with it.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.025
The Empire will never know
which one it was.

16:02.127 --> 16:05.229
Well, can you
do it or not?

16:05.231 --> 16:09.567
(STUTTERS) Yes, I can.
Or at least I can try.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.602
Sorry for
my delayed response.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.839
I was just rather stunned
by the fact that you
had a good idea.

16:14.841 --> 16:16.407
(CHOPPER CHUCKLES)

16:16.409 --> 16:18.810
Just get to work
fixing it.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.979
(CHOPPER GRUNTING
FRUSTRATEDLY)

16:20.981 --> 16:23.448
Oh, good point, Chopper.

16:23.450 --> 16:27.518
It may try to kill us,
so I will restore the droid's
behavioral system

16:27.520 --> 16:29.787
to the disarmed state
in which we found it.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.757
I will also initiate its
return-to-base protocol

16:32.759 --> 16:35.326
so it should promptly
leave peacefully.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.761
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

16:37.596 --> 16:41.132
Main system restart now.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.234
(POWERING UP)

17:02.287 --> 17:04.956
(WHISPERS)
It's leaving the base.
Good job.

17:04.958 --> 17:07.425
Let's make sure
it gets home.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.900
I'm picking up
a second signal.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.602
Must be its ship.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.208
There it is.

17:27.813 --> 17:30.448
(BEEPING)

17:33.719 --> 17:36.054
That's a long-range
transmitter.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.556
It's going to contact
the Empire.

17:39.758 --> 17:41.325
Not if I can help it.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.097
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

17:46.099 --> 17:47.498
(SATELLITE DISH CLANKING)

17:48.067 --> 17:49.767
(CIRCUITS SCRAMBLING)

17:49.769 --> 17:51.669
Yes! (LAUGHS)

17:51.671 --> 17:53.905
We did it. We did it!

17:53.907 --> 17:57.675
Now that it can't
contact the Empire,
it will return home, right?

17:57.677 --> 18:00.611
If it follows
its programming.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.815
(ENGINE POWERING UP)

18:11.723 --> 18:14.058
But what if...
I mean, if it goes back,

18:14.060 --> 18:17.195
and I didn't correctly
reprogram that detonator?

18:17.197 --> 18:21.732
Look, we may not like
each other, but you've
always done your job.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.302
Well,
whatever the outcome,

18:24.304 --> 18:26.804
you performed admirably,
Captain.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.140
(EXHALES)
A lot's happened today.

18:29.142 --> 18:32.310
Not sure if I can deal
with you and me starting
to get along

18:32.312 --> 18:34.112
on top
of everything else.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.813
Hmm. Agreed.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.296
I think that missing unit
is back.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.332
So plug it in.
Let's see what we got.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.802
(POWERING UP)

18:59.838 --> 19:01.272
Alert command.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.307
This droid was damaged,
but found something.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.945
(BEEPING)

19:07.947 --> 19:10.148
Is that a countdown?
Oh, my.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.588
What just happened?

19:17.590 --> 19:20.758
Report!
I believe it was a proton
warhead detonation, sir.

19:32.638 --> 19:36.874
Okay, what happened
that you called me back
on day one of the exercise?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.377
Well, it may be nothing.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.313
We, uh... We think we've
got it all under control.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.848
But just in case...

19:43.850 --> 19:45.816
MAN: (OVER PA)
<i>Incoming message, priority.</i>

19:45.818 --> 19:47.618
Hold that thought.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.555
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

19:50.557 --> 19:53.558
KANAN: You had nothing
to do with what?

19:54.993 --> 19:58.796
FULCRUM:<i> I can only assume</i>
<i>you found and reprogrammed</i>

19:58.798 --> 20:01.465
<i>the lost Infiltrator</i>
<i>I warned you of.</i>

20:01.467 --> 20:03.868
<i>Well,</i>
<i>as you no doubt planned,</i>

20:03.870 --> 20:07.905
<i>the droid did self-destruct</i>
<i>on its return to base.</i>

20:07.907 --> 20:12.176
<i>I don't know how you</i>
<i>pulled it off, but you</i>
<i>have my congratulations.</i>

20:12.178 --> 20:14.078
<i>Fulcrum out.</i>

20:14.080 --> 20:16.881
Uh, what was that about?

20:16.883 --> 20:20.818
Uh... (CHUCKLES)
It's kind of a long story.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.754
Which I can recall
every detail of.

20:23.756 --> 20:27.024
It all began
when Captain Orrelios
brought the droid back...

20:27.026 --> 20:28.726
(MUFFLED SPEECH)
(CHUCKLING)

20:40.005 --> 20:42.573
How did this happen,
Agent Kallus?

20:42.575 --> 20:45.576
I suspect
the rebels captured
a unit in the field

20:45.578 --> 20:49.847
and reprogrammed it
to self-destruct
upon its return to base.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.749
Quite ingenious, really.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.253
I'm inclined to agree.

20:55.255 --> 20:59.924
You seem in
surprisingly good spirits,
considering this loss.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.760
Loss, you say?

21:02.762 --> 21:06.731
Mmm, the rebels may have
protected the location
of their base for now,

21:06.733 --> 21:09.967
but in doing so,
they have narrowed my search.

21:11.803 --> 21:16.107
Before today,
they could have been hiding
in any of a thousand systems.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.075
But now...

21:18.077 --> 21:20.745
Now I know they
are almost certainly

21:20.747 --> 21:26.550
on one of the 94 planets
surveyed by my Infiltrators.

21:26.552 --> 21:29.387
The rebels
have won this battle,

21:29.389 --> 21:32.156
but the war will be ours.
