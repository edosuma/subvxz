20:14.880 --> 20:16.481
[HOOTS]

20:19.051 --> 20:23.388
AS I'VE SAID BEFORE
AND WILL SURELY SAY
MANY TIMES TO COME,

20:23.388 --> 20:28.727
GRAMPS, LISTEN.
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.395
ABOUT THE CAKE ACCIDENT, I--

20:30.395 --> 20:31.964
IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.498
I KNOW,
AND AS A PUNISHMENT,

20:33.498 --> 20:36.468
I'M CUTTING
YOUR DRAGON TRAINING
IN HALF THIS SUMMER.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.403
LISTEN, I TOTALLY UNDER--

20:38.403 --> 20:42.841
JAKE, I TRAIN YOU HARD
BECAUSE I KNOW THE ENEMIES
YOU HAVE TO FACE.

20:42.841 --> 20:45.310
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
YOU'RE ONLY
14 YEARS OLD.

20:45.310 --> 20:48.780
YOU DESERVE SOME TIME
TO CHILL AND HANG
WITH YOUR PEEPS.

20:48.780 --> 20:52.784
AND THERE'S NO REASON
WHY HALEY CAN'T FILL IN
FROM TIME TO TIME.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.987
SHE DID A GREAT JOB
THIS WEEK.

20:54.987 --> 20:59.124
YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID,
BUT A QUICK PIECE OF ADVICE.

20:59.124 --> 21:01.994
STAY AWAY FROM
ESSENCE OF TROLL.

21:01.994 --> 21:05.964
WE HAVE A GRADUATION
TO ATTEND.

21:05.964 --> 21:07.466
Jake: SO THERE YOU HAVE IT,

21:07.466 --> 21:09.968
THE WEEK I WASN'T
THE AMERICAN DRAGON.

21:09.968 --> 21:13.071
THAT NIGHT AT GRADUATION,
I GOT TO THINKING.

21:13.071 --> 21:16.208
BEING HUMAN WAS A WAKE-UP CALL.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.244
SURE THERE HAVE BEEN
SOME TOUGH TIMES,

21:19.244 --> 21:21.446
BUT HAVING MAGICAL POWERS
HAS KIND OF ROCKED,

21:21.446 --> 21:26.418
AND NOT JUST IN A SAVING
THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT
KIND OF WAY,

21:26.418 --> 21:28.453
BUT IN A COOL,
EVERYDAY KIND OF WAY, TOO.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.322
I MEAN, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

21:30.322 --> 21:35.394
HAVING A SECRET DOUBLE LIFE IS
ALWAYS GONNA BE A BALANCING ACT,

21:35.394 --> 21:39.197
BUT WITH THE HELP
OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY...

21:39.197 --> 21:45.237
I KNOW I CAN TOTALLY FACE
ANYTHING LIFE THROWS AT ME.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.011
[DRIP]

21:54.246 --> 21:55.814
[DRIP]

21:55.814 --> 22:04.489
[SIZZLES]

22:04.489 --> 22:05.357
[ROARS]

22:08.393 --> 22:14.433
THANKS TO AN INGENIOUS LITTLE
DEVICE CALLED VOICE-OVER.

22:14.433 --> 22:17.035
SO I WAS THINKIN'
WHY NOT USE VOICE-OVER

22:17.035 --> 22:21.406
TO LET YOU, THE VIEWER,
HEAR MY DEEPEST,
MOST PERSONAL THOUGHTS?

22:21.406 --> 22:22.441
HUH? HUH? AHEM.

22:22.441 --> 22:24.209
OK, HERE GOES.

22:24.209 --> 22:25.410
AH GEH GEH.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.545
WAIT. THERE'S MORE.

22:26.545 --> 22:29.414
AND THEN PIÈCE DE RÉSISTANCE.

22:29.414 --> 22:32.484
AH GOO GOO GOO, GOO GOO GOO.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.553
WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTIN',
SOCRATES?

22:34.553 --> 22:36.521
I'M A DOG,
FOR CRYIN' OUT SAKES.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.456
AH GEH GEH HOO HOO!
