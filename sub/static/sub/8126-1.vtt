00:57.222 --> 01:00.558
oh, my.
That's the 11th time...

01:00.626 --> 01:03.628
I've been up and down
those stairs this morning.

01:03.696 --> 01:08.533
I don't know why you do it, ma.
I know Oscar's a guest,
but he's impossible.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.669
I can see why
he drives daddy up the wall.

01:10.736 --> 01:13.404
Oh, well,
he won't be here for long.

01:13.472 --> 01:15.807
Where is your father anyway?

01:15.875 --> 01:19.878
Oh. Oscar got up early,
came down and grabbed
Archie's sports section.

01:19.945 --> 01:22.513
He went back to bed,
so Archie had to go out
and get another paper.

01:22.581 --> 01:26.084
Oh, I bet that
made him mad.

01:26.152 --> 01:31.289
There was one other relative
that aggravated your
father-in-law like that.

01:31.356 --> 01:37.028
Kind of a tall fellow
with reddish hair.
Real large earlobes.

01:39.131 --> 01:44.936
And warts on his right hand
that he used to wear
a glove to cover.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.672
Ma, that's cousin Oscar.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.575
That's right.

01:52.144 --> 01:56.047
He just don't wear
the glove no more.

01:56.115 --> 02:00.551
Oh, Archie, there you are.
You had to get another paper?

02:00.619 --> 02:04.723
Uh, no, Edith.
I had to go out
and inspect the traffic lights.

02:04.790 --> 02:08.193
"Don't walk. Walk."
"Don't walk. Walk,"
you know?

02:08.259 --> 02:11.462
They work fine.

02:11.530 --> 02:13.698
I got something
to tell all of youse.
I made up my mind.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.967
I'm going to get rid
of that bum Oscar today.

02:16.035 --> 02:18.203
I got a call in to
cousin Lou in Detroit.

02:18.270 --> 02:21.940
He's the head of the family.
Let him figure out some way
to get Oscar home.

02:22.007 --> 02:24.575
And by the way,
where's our guest of honor
at this moment?

02:24.643 --> 02:27.645
He's in bed.
12:00 nearly,

02:27.713 --> 02:31.716
and that deadbeat
is still up there sawing wood?
Maybe he's tired.

02:31.784 --> 02:35.286
Well, I ain't surprised.
He was up half the night
flushing the toilet.

02:37.289 --> 02:39.190
That's what has me
a wreck today.

02:39.258 --> 02:44.095
Yeah, I heard that too.
Maybe the man has a problem.
Maybe he isn't well.

02:44.163 --> 02:47.665
He's well all right.
After the third flush
he was doing it to spite me.

02:49.668 --> 02:52.103
All his life
he's been spiting me.

02:52.171 --> 02:54.639
It could be insomnia.

02:54.706 --> 02:59.210
Some people listen to water
to help them fall asleep.

03:01.546 --> 03:07.285
So he was running between
his room and the toilet 32 times
to help himself go to sleep?

03:07.352 --> 03:11.489
It does sound complicated
when you think about it.

03:11.556 --> 03:14.225
Do me a favor, huh?
Just butt out
of the conversation.

03:14.293 --> 03:16.627
His whole being here
is your fault anyhow.

03:16.695 --> 03:20.698
Now will you vacate
that chair, meathead?

03:20.766 --> 03:24.769
Daddy, the man showed up
at our front door
looking so desperate.

03:24.837 --> 03:28.306
He's your cousin, Archie.
How could I say no?

03:28.373 --> 03:31.375
This way, Edith. "No."

03:33.412 --> 03:37.581
Maybe we'll all feel better
if we had breakfast now.

03:37.649 --> 03:39.818
<i>Oh, yeah. Good.</i>
<i>I'm starving.</i>
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

03:39.885 --> 03:43.054
- Shouldn't we tell Oscar
we're eating?
- No, no, no.

03:43.122 --> 03:45.589
If he's still up there,
we'll leave him go hungry.

03:45.657 --> 03:47.591
Oh, he won't go hungry.

03:47.659 --> 03:52.864
Right after he went to bed
with your sports section, I
took him up a little something.

03:52.932 --> 03:57.768
Edith, I'm the married guy here,
and I don't get
my breakfast in bed.

03:57.837 --> 04:00.738
It was just a poached egg
and some prunes.

04:00.806 --> 04:03.541
That ain't the point
what it is, Edith.

04:03.608 --> 04:06.277
And if there's anything
that that guy don't need,
it's prunes.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.987
Geez, I'm trying to figure out
how to get rid of the guy, she's
giving him breakfast in bed.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.957
And nothing on the table
for us.
I'll get it right away.

04:19.024 --> 04:21.091
I'll help you, ma.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.295
Hey, arch, how long
you felt this way
about Oscar?

04:24.363 --> 04:26.965
Aw, forever.
He was six years older
than me.

04:27.032 --> 04:29.533
He was always
this big hump with
a whole lot of red hair...

04:29.601 --> 04:32.270
And earlobes
as big as apricots.

04:32.338 --> 04:35.173
And all kinds of warts.
When we was kids,

04:35.241 --> 04:38.776
he was always chasing me
on the grass, knocking me down
and sitting on my face.

04:40.712 --> 04:45.083
- That's it?
- Ain't that enough?

04:45.150 --> 04:48.152
You mean all he ever did
was sit on your face
on the grass?

04:48.220 --> 04:50.088
Sometimes on the cement.

04:51.556 --> 04:54.425
I can see where you can really
get to hate a guy for that.

04:54.493 --> 04:56.494
How's cousin Oscar
related to you anyway, daddy?

04:56.561 --> 05:00.564
Aw, who knows?
Like any second cousin
eight or nine times removed.

05:00.632 --> 05:03.434
Wait a minute.
I think I remember.

05:03.502 --> 05:08.006
Your sister Alma
had a brother Phil--

05:08.073 --> 05:12.911
<i>wait a minute, Edith.</i>
<i>Why do you say my sister</i>
<i>Alma had a brother Phil?</i>

05:14.446 --> 05:18.883
If my sister had
a brother Phil, then
I had a brother Phil too.

05:18.951 --> 05:23.788
Well, sure.
But it's that way
in every family, Archie.

05:26.158 --> 05:31.829
Like my sister Helen
is also my sister gertrude's--

05:31.897 --> 05:34.465
oh, stifle it, will ya?
I understand.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.002
Hey, what is this?
What's in these bottles?

05:38.070 --> 05:41.272
Oh, those are
Oscar's vitamin supplements.

05:41.340 --> 05:46.344
He don't need no supplements.
The guy eats as much
as all of us put together.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.579
If Oscar was here regular,
I'd give myself three months...

05:48.647 --> 05:51.416
Then it's over the hill
to the poor house for me.
Eggs, Archie?

05:51.483 --> 05:55.320
No, no. Forget it, Edith.
I got no appetite anymore.
Somebody get me a cigar.

05:55.387 --> 05:57.322
Right away.
No.
Let me, ma.

05:58.824 --> 06:00.992
Did he bring
these vitamins with him?

06:01.060 --> 06:04.762
Oh, no. When I went shopping
they was on his food order.

06:04.830 --> 06:08.232
His-- his food order?

06:08.300 --> 06:10.868
Edith, these vitamins
cost the moon.

06:10.936 --> 06:14.939
- What else
was on the food order?
- Nothing. Just the regular.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.308
Meat, fruit, liquor.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.011
You bought him liquor?

06:20.079 --> 06:24.282
You only had rye.
He wanted Brandy.

06:24.350 --> 06:28.353
He wanted Brandy?
Daddy, I don't see
any cigars here.

06:28.420 --> 06:32.390
Well, just look a little harder,
little girl, will ya?
Use your eyes over there.

06:32.458 --> 06:34.392
Edith, what have we got
going here? Brandy?

06:34.460 --> 06:37.295
Who do I look like,
the Duke of windsor?

06:37.363 --> 06:39.563
Edith, let me see
the rest of the food order.

06:39.631 --> 06:43.667
I don't have it.
I think I threw it away.

06:43.735 --> 06:46.070
What do you mean
you think you threw it away?

06:46.138 --> 06:49.240
"A," you did or "b," you didn't.
Pick one.

06:49.308 --> 06:52.710
I think I'll pick "a."

06:54.713 --> 06:57.382
Daddy, there aren't
any cigars here.

06:57.449 --> 07:00.018
She says there are
no cigars there.
What happened to my cigars?

07:00.085 --> 07:03.087
I guess you better
ask Oscar.

07:03.155 --> 07:05.823
Oscar don't smoke cigars.
He does now.

07:05.891 --> 07:09.227
Well, now, that does it!
Now that's the thing
that broke the straw.

07:09.294 --> 07:13.431
That's all there is to it.
I'm going to get rid of that
freeloader today. Right now.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.667
<i>Mike, go up and tell him.</i>

07:16.735 --> 07:19.570
- Why me?
- Because I asked you to.

07:19.638 --> 07:21.906
Can't you do that?
Run upstairs, huh?

07:21.973 --> 07:26.477
Tell him get out of bed,
get out of my pajamas
and get his tail down here.

07:26.545 --> 07:28.979
And youse two, come on
and clear off the table.
Come on.

07:29.048 --> 07:32.917
Maybe we'd better wait.
What for, Edith?

07:32.984 --> 07:36.754
It's almost his lunchtime,
and his steak
is already defrosting.

07:36.821 --> 07:40.558
His steak?
Edith, put that steak
back in the freezer.

07:40.625 --> 07:44.462
It's probably big enough
for the four of us. We can
have it for new year's Eve.

07:44.530 --> 07:47.532
He ain't gonna have time for
no lunch, 'cause I'm gonna
get rid of Oscar...

07:47.599 --> 07:50.301
In post and in haste.

07:50.369 --> 07:54.205
Come on. Get the food
off the table. He'll eat
anything in sight, that guy.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.941
Hurry up.
Come on, Gloria.

07:57.008 --> 07:59.843
I tell you something,
family can go just so far.

07:59.911 --> 08:02.746
Then you gotta grab
the bull by the "corns"
and heave-ho.

08:06.351 --> 08:09.187
[ Clears throat ]
Did you get him up?
Is he coming down here?

08:09.254 --> 08:11.755
No.
What do you mean, no?

08:11.823 --> 08:13.924
You didn't get him up,
or he ain't coming down?

08:15.327 --> 08:19.663
Both.
What is that foolish look
on your face?

08:19.731 --> 08:21.732
Why didn't you
wake Oscar up?

08:21.800 --> 08:24.502
He's dead.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.870
What?

08:26.938 --> 08:29.006
He's dead.

08:30.209 --> 08:33.644
What are you telling me
a thing like that for?

08:33.712 --> 08:35.813
'Cause he is.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.381
No.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.884
Yeah.

08:40.952 --> 08:43.121
No.

08:45.257 --> 08:48.058
Yeah.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.060
Wait.

09:08.947 --> 09:11.949
Well, he sat
on my face again.

09:13.918 --> 09:19.023
He's got relations in 16 cities,
but he's got to pick
my attic to die in.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.592
Is Oscar down yet, Archie?

09:21.660 --> 09:23.827
Uh, no, he ain't, Edith.
Say nothing to
your mother-in-law.

09:23.895 --> 09:26.197
She can't handle these things.
She flies all to pieces.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.966
Is something wrong?
What happened?

09:29.034 --> 09:30.734
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

09:30.802 --> 09:33.371
[ Softly ] She flies
right to pieces. Keep quiet.
Where's Oscar?

09:33.438 --> 09:35.939
Uh, in bed.
He hasn't moved.

09:38.777 --> 09:43.113
What's everybody
acting so funny about?
Is something wrong with Oscar?

09:43.182 --> 09:46.116
She's going right to pieces,
nobody even told her yet.
Shh!

09:46.185 --> 09:48.186
Told me what?
Is it about Oscar?
Told her what?

09:48.253 --> 09:50.588
Edith, please.
Don't get hysterical.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.823
I think there's something
wrong with Oscar.

09:52.891 --> 09:55.059
Now, don't go up there.
Why not?
Calm down now,

09:55.126 --> 09:57.428
you two women,
just calm down!

09:57.496 --> 10:00.565
Gee whiz. There's no reason
to get hysterical
at a time like this.

10:00.632 --> 10:02.633
What we don't need is
a lot of screaming and crying!

10:02.701 --> 10:04.635
Who's screaming?
Who's crying?
Just calm down.

10:04.703 --> 10:07.805
Michael,
what do you mean?
Relax. Take it easy.

10:07.872 --> 10:11.942
The two of youse
just dummy up, huh?

10:12.010 --> 10:16.480
Now let me handle this.
Edith, uh,

10:16.548 --> 10:21.385
I got something
to tell ya.
Oscar's dead, isn't he?

10:27.058 --> 10:30.894
Why couldn't you wait
for me to tell you that?

10:30.962 --> 10:34.565
Ma! Ma!
What'll we do?
[ Crying ]

10:34.633 --> 10:38.636
Why, we'll call the doctor.

10:38.704 --> 10:42.306
We'll call Dr. Kelly
so he can come over here...

10:42.374 --> 10:45.610
And sign the certificate
so we can move the body.

10:45.677 --> 10:48.212
- <i>[ Phone rings ]</i>
<i>- [ Screams ]</i>

10:48.280 --> 10:51.449
Let me through here.
I'll move the body.

10:53.619 --> 10:57.455
Hello? Yes, operator.
Put him on, will ya?

10:57.522 --> 10:59.590
It's Lou from Detroit.

10:59.658 --> 11:04.495
Hello, Lou.
Hi. Archie from New York.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.398
Yeah.
[ Chuckles ]

11:07.466 --> 11:10.134
Lou, I was calling you
for something before,

11:10.201 --> 11:13.070
but now it's something else
I gotta tell ya.

11:13.138 --> 11:16.974
A-anyway, uh, get ready
for a little bad news.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.377
Uh, cousin Oscar's dead here.

11:21.546 --> 11:25.883
What do you mean,
"how's the weather
in New York?"

11:25.950 --> 11:30.621
I just told you Oscar's dead.
We gotta get him back
to Detroit to be buried.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.190
Now-now, come on, Lou.

11:33.258 --> 11:37.094
Now you know how he was
closest to your end of
the family out there.

11:37.162 --> 11:40.164
I think you're legally
responsible for the body.

11:40.231 --> 11:42.600
What do you mean possession
is nine-tenths of the law?

11:42.668 --> 11:47.171
Come on.

11:47.238 --> 11:49.440
[ Stammering ]
Listen, Lou.
All right, don't get mad.

11:49.508 --> 11:52.843
We can do it here.
He can be buried in New York.
Edith and I can handle it.

11:52.911 --> 11:55.413
But what about the money?

11:55.480 --> 11:58.982
Well, you got plenty
of relations out there.
Pass the hat. Get something.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.619
Send us the money.
Wire it to me.

12:01.687 --> 12:06.324
You do that, Lou.
Get back to me and fast, huh?
Good-bye.

12:06.391 --> 12:09.059
You crumb.

12:09.127 --> 12:13.297
How much is a house call
from doc Kelly?
$20.

12:13.365 --> 12:16.701
And how much do you figure
that phone to Detroit?
About 3 1/2.

12:16.768 --> 12:21.405
Oh, geez.
And maybe another 30
to have this guy collected.

12:21.473 --> 12:24.308
You're still doing it
to me, Oscar, boy.

12:24.376 --> 12:28.979
You ain't dead 20 minutes

more than 50 bucks.

<i>What's that, Freddy?</i>
<i>Look-look, Freddy.</i>

I mean, I'm only
a second cousin,
you're a first.

12:38.256 --> 12:41.459
Now you gotta help
with this thing.
I did call other people.

12:41.526 --> 12:45.363
I called cousin Lou in Detroit.
He's taking up a collection
of most of the relations there.

12:45.430 --> 12:48.265
But, listen, you gotta
help me with this thing too.

you can and get back to me, huh?
Fast. I'll wait for the call.

Yeah. Good-bye.
You crumb.

Like I was telling your wife,
you made a wise choice.

By entrusting your beloved
to a neighborhood mortuary,

to say undertakers anymore.

I know you 13 years
from the lodge, right?

13:43.622 --> 13:47.458
And you know me.
Now, can I get a simple answer
to a simple question? How much?

13:47.526 --> 13:49.660
Well, let's take a look
at the book.

All right, here's--
we got 329-l, arch.
We call it the patriot.

13:54.299 --> 13:57.301
Now the motif is early American,
as you can see.

Red, white and blue quilting.

14:00.605 --> 14:05.108
And painted on the inside lid,
facing the deceased,
the American flag.

How much?
What's the difference
how much, Archie?

14:10.214 --> 14:13.818
Mr. whitehead, I've been

don't mind my speaking openly--

this whole thing is barbaric.
It's like some kind of circus.

$325.
$325 just for a box?

14:41.713 --> 14:44.748
The casket, Archie.
His home through eternity.

14:44.816 --> 14:47.551
The man couldn't care less
about a home when he was living.
