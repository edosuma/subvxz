WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.434
Previously on Dominion...

00:01.468 --> 00:02.735
Our brother's learned a new trick.

00:02.770 --> 00:05.003
He knows how to possess the lower angels.

00:05.038 --> 00:07.506
Does the child know
about your colorful past?

00:07.540 --> 00:10.475
Is that a threat? I need your help, Louis.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.511
I understand you not wanting to go against

00:12.545 --> 00:17.182
your fellow angel. Stand
with me or leave Vega.

00:17.216 --> 00:19.585
These angel-worshiping traitors...

00:19.619 --> 00:23.855
when I find them, I will end them.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.290
My acolytes

00:25.325 --> 00:27.793
need protecting at all costs.

00:27.827 --> 00:29.394
As soon as this wedding is over,

00:29.429 --> 00:30.929
you're gonna step down.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.397
That isn't just any eight-ball in there.

00:32.432 --> 00:34.032
That's Claire's mother.

00:34.067 --> 00:35.734
I've read the texts.
I know about evictions.

00:35.768 --> 00:37.569
Shut your mouth!

00:37.604 --> 00:38.770
Sanctify this vessel.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.376
- Do something!
- Michael!

00:44.410 --> 00:46.178
I can't. No one can.

02:10.548 --> 02:12.748
_

02:27.914 --> 02:31.049
Give me the room.

02:52.138 --> 02:55.273
Little pig, little pig...

02:55.308 --> 02:57.242
This old V-5 lady, she gives me 100 chip

02:57.276 --> 02:58.944
- for a half-dozen peaches?
- Must be good peaches.

02:58.978 --> 03:00.846
Well, she thought it was a 10.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.180
- When I go to correct her...
- Little pig...

03:02.215 --> 03:03.315
let me in.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.650
...to rip...

03:13.392 --> 03:16.394
Louis?

03:16.429 --> 03:18.797
Louis, you okay?

03:23.636 --> 03:25.103
Never better.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.572
I don't know what came over me.

03:27.607 --> 03:29.908
- You work too hard.
- Mmm.

03:29.942 --> 03:31.276
You're right.

03:31.310 --> 03:33.445
I think I have earned some "Me Time,"

03:33.479 --> 03:35.480
haven't I?

Where are you?

04:11.851 --> 04:14.252
Ha ha ha ha!

04:17.356 --> 04:19.724
I win.

04:41.647 --> 04:44.015
Those things will kill you.

04:58.164 --> 04:59.464
Sanctify this vessel.

04:59.498 --> 05:01.533
Don't you know who I am?

05:01.567 --> 05:03.969
Your name is Jonathan Reese.

05:04.003 --> 05:06.571
His name is Jonathan Reese.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.206
- My name...
- Dirge, we know.

05:08.241 --> 05:09.241
Ha ha ha ha!

05:09.275 --> 05:11.142
Sanctify this vessel.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.844
Perhaps the Apocrypha.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.013
I don't need to read the damn book anymore.

05:15.047 --> 05:18.016
- Says who?
- Says the markings.

05:18.050 --> 05:20.218
You might have told me that.
That signifies progress.

05:20.253 --> 05:22.320
Yeah, and I'm trying to
build on that progress.

05:22.355 --> 05:25.523
Save human lives.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.067
Sanctify this vessel.

05:36.102 --> 05:42.574
Sanctify this vessel.

05:42.608 --> 05:47.112
I applaud your enthusiasm,
but overconfidence is a trap.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.680
I know how this works.

05:48.714 --> 05:50.799
I burned the angel out of Claire's mom.

05:50.833 --> 05:54.035
Clementine was a unique case.
For want of a better word,

05:54.069 --> 05:55.787
she was domesticated by the General.

05:55.821 --> 05:58.890
It might have had an effect.

05:58.925 --> 06:02.994
Yeah, well, what about this one?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.262
Florida.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.431
Wasn't anywhere near domesticated.

06:06.465 --> 06:08.633
Brought him back to the
surface for five minutes.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.569
Five minutes, and then he
went into convulsions and died.

06:11.604 --> 06:15.073
And these are the only
ones who carried I.D.s.

06:15.107 --> 06:16.541
What about Nevada?

06:16.575 --> 06:18.276
I believe I was out when you worked on her.

06:18.311 --> 06:20.912
Yeah, you don't want to know about Nevada.

06:20.947 --> 06:24.049
Yes, I do.

06:24.083 --> 06:26.584
Snapped her own neck before I could finish.

06:26.619 --> 06:30.388
Spiritual matters have
never been an exact science.

06:30.423 --> 06:33.224
He's a lost cause, isn't
he? This poor son of a bitch.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.393
Don't pity him.

06:35.428 --> 06:40.165
Those who knew the body
have long since mourned.

06:42.268 --> 06:44.736
Sorry.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.071
Oh, are you?

06:46.105 --> 06:48.340
Wasn't talking to you, Dirge.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.081
I agreed to let you hone your skills,

06:56.115 --> 06:58.750
but this is becoming a fool's errand.

06:58.784 --> 07:00.585
Better a fool who tries and fails

07:00.619 --> 07:06.624
than a coward who sits
around and does nothing.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.928
We've been hanging out too much.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.364
You can't keep doing this to yourself.

07:12.398 --> 07:16.401
I can, and I will until I get it right.

07:26.212 --> 07:29.180
- You have to eat.
- You're insane.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.982
You need your strength.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.283
Worshiping Gabriel,

07:32.318 --> 07:35.220
that despicable piece of shit.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.156
I'm looking out for myself, okay?

07:38.190 --> 07:41.726
Something you taught me
from a very young age.

07:41.761 --> 07:45.964
- And now I'm looking out for you.
- Don't patronize me.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.166
I'm trying to save you.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.668
That's what I used to tell people on TV,

07:50.703 --> 07:53.238
usually accompanied by a 1-800 number.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.140
Yes, but I'm not you, am I, Father?

07:55.174 --> 07:57.675
Because I'm telling the truth.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.347
When the end comes...

08:02.381 --> 08:04.549
there will be humans who are spared,

08:04.583 --> 08:06.351
and the ones I care about

08:06.385 --> 08:09.888
- will be among them.
- I'm not of your acolytes,

08:09.922 --> 08:12.223
and I never will be.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.494
I teach one thing.

08:16.529 --> 08:18.463
That the chosen one will save us.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.698
Oh, please.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.200
But my sheep from the savior
church don't need to know

08:22.234 --> 08:24.069
their time is near.

08:24.103 --> 08:26.404
They're comforted by those words.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.540
But we wise and fortunate
followers of Gabriel

08:28.574 --> 08:31.976
know that he will only
bring about their end.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.381
Will you listen to
yourself? You're delusional.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.321
Says the man who thought
building a wall around a city...

08:43.355 --> 08:46.257
- Ah!
- would keep him safe.

08:46.292 --> 08:50.428
When all he actually
ever needed was Gabriel.

08:50.463 --> 08:55.400
You can go on as much as
you like about Gabriel.

08:55.434 --> 08:58.403
This is about how I mistreated you,

08:58.437 --> 08:59.471
isn't it?

08:59.505 --> 09:01.906
Gabriel teaches us where one breaks,

09:01.941 --> 09:03.775
one becomes stronger.

09:03.809 --> 09:05.777
And you, Father, have given me

09:05.811 --> 09:07.278
more strength than I can measure.

09:07.313 --> 09:10.315
I never thought you had
the balls for revenge.

09:10.349 --> 09:14.019
This isn't about revenge.

09:14.053 --> 09:18.123
This is about love.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.403
Claire.

09:32.438 --> 09:33.638
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.140
Is everything okay? Your father?

09:35.174 --> 09:36.474
Yes, he's fine.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.409
Actually, I'm here with good news.

09:38.444 --> 09:41.012
I was beginning to wonder if
there ever was such a thing.

09:41.046 --> 09:42.313
Mm-hmm, there is.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.415
I want to move the wedding forward.

09:44.450 --> 09:47.619
That's, uh...

09:47.653 --> 09:49.988
That's great news.

09:54.827 --> 09:58.163
Yes, it is.

09:58.197 --> 10:02.133
- How soon did you have in mind?
- Next week.

10:02.168 --> 10:05.803
Claire, I'm thrilled, but... why the rush?

10:05.838 --> 10:08.306
I'm gonna level with you, William.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.542
I fought to keep my father
in office when the Senate

10:10.576 --> 10:13.711
went after him, and I'm just
not sure it was a good idea.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.314
I feel if we get married sooner,
then I can take the burden

10:16.348 --> 10:19.117
of running the city off
his shoulders quicker.

10:19.151 --> 10:20.985
How's your father?

10:21.020 --> 10:24.355
He's taken a bit of a turn,
actually, with his pneumonia.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.558
Shouldn't he be in the infirmary?

10:26.592 --> 10:28.826
Yeah, but you know him.

10:28.861 --> 10:31.362
He can't have anyone see him weak,

10:31.397 --> 10:33.364
even if it means he suffers.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.366
Well, tell him his
future daughter-in-law

10:35.401 --> 10:39.837
- says "Get well soon."
- I will.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.506
Thank you.

11:07.766 --> 11:10.902
We missed you at the bar tonight.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.037
Otherwise occupied.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.173
Yeah, uh-huh.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.908
I made a toast in your honor.

11:16.942 --> 11:18.710
If you were there, you
would have killed me.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.878
About Claire moving up the wedding.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.580
Old news.

11:22.615 --> 11:25.550
Then why do you look like
someone killed your dog?

11:25.584 --> 11:27.585
Since when are V-2s allowed dogs, hmm?

11:27.620 --> 11:29.387
Oh, poor guy.

11:29.421 --> 11:32.357
I'd offer you some Scotch,
but someone drank it all.

11:32.391 --> 11:33.958
It's been a rough few weeks.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.562
It'll be a lot less
rough if you loop me in.

11:37.596 --> 11:41.199
Or Ethan. Or anyone.

11:41.233 --> 11:45.470
There's nothing to be looped in about.

11:45.504 --> 11:48.539
Look, if you don't cheer up,

11:48.574 --> 11:51.242
you're gonna leave me no choice.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.079
- Nomes...
- Hmm?

11:55.114 --> 11:56.781
I'm not playing this game. Ah!

11:59.285 --> 12:01.653
- No, don't, okay?
- Yeah. W...

12:01.687 --> 12:03.454
Please... Ah!

12:03.489 --> 12:04.555
Stop!

12:04.590 --> 12:06.624
It's just your face every time...

12:06.659 --> 12:08.826
I'm sorry, just it's sad
that I have to hurt you

12:08.861 --> 12:10.962
to make you laugh.

12:10.996 --> 12:12.730
Ah!

12:12.765 --> 12:14.399
Okay, okay.

12:16.201 --> 12:18.603
I guess the chosen one can laugh, huh?

12:22.641 --> 12:25.143
- Ah...
- What?

12:25.177 --> 12:28.046
I'm not blind.

12:28.080 --> 12:33.318
Jeep passed them on to you, didn't he?

12:33.352 --> 12:36.621
Maybe they mean you're something special.

12:36.655 --> 12:38.890
Maybe they don't mean anything at all.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.930
To me, you'll always be plain old Alex.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.168
I've known you way too long to be impressed

12:50.202 --> 12:52.270
by a couple of tattoos.

12:53.972 --> 12:57.875
And I've known you too long to believe you.

13:17.529 --> 13:19.430
Things are different now, Nomes.

13:19.464 --> 13:20.398
Why?

13:20.432 --> 13:24.102
Can the chosen one still have a good time?

14:00.139 --> 14:04.208
- Brother Jeffrey.
- Louis.

14:04.243 --> 14:06.043
You can't be here.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.879
For a million reasons, but
mainly because I'm tired

14:07.913 --> 14:11.082
of you asking me about this Michael thing.

14:11.116 --> 14:12.350
I'm still neutral.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.486
Becoming some operative for
Michael isn't in the cards.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.924
Then you should align with Gabriel.

14:19.958 --> 14:21.793
That maniac?

14:21.827 --> 14:23.294
I'm not stupid.

14:23.328 --> 14:24.662
You know,

14:24.696 --> 14:29.734
he's not such a bad guy,
once you get to know him.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.989
Take five.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.692
You got it, Senator.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.466
What the...

15:17.916 --> 15:19.917
What is it?

15:28.527 --> 15:31.496
- Get Riesen on the radio.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:31.530 --> 15:35.099
Control, we need General
Riesen down here now.

15:46.896 --> 15:49.030
Did you know, Michael,

15:49.065 --> 15:50.899
that they were higher angels

15:50.933 --> 15:53.668
that were living inside our walls?

15:53.703 --> 15:56.237
A medic, a bank clerk, an engineer.

15:56.272 --> 15:57.439
By all accounts these men and women

15:57.473 --> 15:58.773
were ordinary citizens of Vega

15:58.808 --> 16:00.608
seeking asylum at a dangerous time.

16:00.643 --> 16:01.843
No different than you.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.446
You didn't answer my question.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.047
You stood in front of the Senate,

16:06.081 --> 16:06.881
and you told them...

16:06.916 --> 16:08.450
I told them what they wanted to hear

16:08.484 --> 16:09.851
so they wouldn't go
after innocent citizens.

16:09.885 --> 16:13.822
Like General Riesen's maid?

16:13.856 --> 16:15.990
How was I to know she'd
side with my brother?

16:16.025 --> 16:18.793
The people have faith in you, Michael.

16:18.828 --> 16:21.629
And you lied to us...

16:21.664 --> 16:23.264
all of us.

16:23.299 --> 16:26.234
You're right to keep your distance from me.

16:27.770 --> 16:29.137
Riesen's blowing the rest of the tunnels

16:29.171 --> 16:31.873
and activating the guns.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.775
If any more of your kind attempt to leave,

16:33.809 --> 16:35.210
they'll be torn to shreds.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.046
Then we'll all be that
much safer, won't we?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.515
Return to your homes.

16:40.549 --> 16:43.284
Return... to your homes.

16:44.987 --> 16:49.991
Did he know they were higher angels?

16:50.025 --> 16:53.862
No. He's as surprised as we are.

16:53.896 --> 16:55.296
Before you burn the remains,

16:55.331 --> 16:59.134
I want time with them in the lab.

16:59.168 --> 17:02.003
Find out everything you can about them.

17:02.037 --> 17:03.972
And work on that poker face.

17:04.006 --> 17:07.308
I can always tell when you're lying.

17:07.343 --> 17:09.844
Careful, Becca.

17:13.816 --> 17:16.317
- That's awful.
- Awful?

17:16.352 --> 17:18.685
The person who did this
should get a big fat reward.

17:18.721 --> 17:20.488
You think this is a good thing?

17:20.522 --> 17:21.689
Angels dying?

17:21.723 --> 17:23.157
Yeah, I do.

17:23.192 --> 17:25.026
All this is gonna do
is make people paranoid.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.494
Everyone's gonna be looking
at each other differently now.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.130
Good. We all need to be on the lookout.

17:29.165 --> 17:30.765
For what?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.034
- These people never hurt anyone.
- Angels are not people.

17:33.068 --> 17:34.469
That medic stitched up your face

17:34.503 --> 17:36.004
when you totaled the rover, Ethan.

17:36.038 --> 17:38.540
Since when have you gone soft on the enemy?

17:38.574 --> 17:40.441
I don't like anyone
innocent getting killed.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.043
Don't fall for it, Alex.

17:42.077 --> 17:43.778
I told you. They're not people.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.948
They just look like it. Trust me.

17:46.982 --> 17:49.017
The first ones that came down...

17:49.051 --> 17:51.452
they were animals.

17:53.022 --> 17:55.957
- Shit I saw...
- Sergeant Lannon.

17:55.991 --> 17:58.059
A word.

17:58.093 --> 18:00.061
This is your final warning.

18:00.095 --> 18:01.963
You must vacate the premises. Anyone not...

18:04.934 --> 18:07.035
Michael.

18:07.069 --> 18:08.469
- Hey!
- Did you do this?

18:08.504 --> 18:09.804
Michael, I had to set Felicia on fire

18:09.839 --> 18:11.139
and kick her out of a window

18:11.173 --> 18:13.508
just to barely walk away from that fight.

18:13.542 --> 18:16.778
These guys all look like they
just let someone cut them up.

18:19.882 --> 18:22.917
- You knew them.
- They were neutrals.

18:22.952 --> 18:25.153
I gave them the choice
to stay in Vega or leave.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.721
I shouldn't have left them an option.

18:26.755 --> 18:28.890
There's more of 'em?

18:28.924 --> 18:31.492
- Why didn't you tell me?
- You didn't need to know.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.261
The others need to be
warned. They're in danger.

18:33.295 --> 18:35.096
Well then what the hell
are you talking to me for?

18:35.130 --> 18:37.599
My presence will only
draw attention to them.

18:40.603 --> 18:42.537
I'll do it.

18:42.571 --> 18:43.838
You've been catching eight-balls for me.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.341
- I owe you a solid.
- Yes, you do.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.245
Go and see a higher named Louis.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.780
This address. Tell him to warn the others.

18:52.815 --> 18:54.349
Though their true nature can be discerned,

18:54.383 --> 18:56.784
they must not attempt to flee
or they'll be gunned down.

18:56.819 --> 18:58.419
I thought higher angels
couldn't be detected.

18:58.454 --> 19:00.188
Not without help.

19:50.272 --> 19:53.207
It's nice to see you on your feet, sir.

19:55.311 --> 19:57.912
How much do you know?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.247
More than the others.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.282
Will you help me?

20:01.317 --> 20:04.519
If you promise not to shiv me.

20:06.922 --> 20:09.757
Well, don't give me a reason.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.693
This way, sir.

20:15.230 --> 20:19.100
Once I'm out, have the house secured

20:19.134 --> 20:21.135
and have my son arrested

20:21.170 --> 20:24.005
and brought down through
the streets in handcuffs.

20:24.039 --> 20:28.476
None of this back-alley limo stuff.

20:28.510 --> 20:30.278
Yes, sir.

20:36.185 --> 20:37.652
He may have drugged me,

20:37.686 --> 20:41.122
but this sure as hell
doesn't look like the garage.

20:41.156 --> 20:44.692
- That's because it's not.
- You ungrateful prick.

20:44.727 --> 20:48.162
If it wasn't for me,
you'd be down on the island

20:48.197 --> 20:50.732
eating bread crusts with the other V-1s.

20:53.202 --> 20:55.737
What's my name, Mr. Whele?

20:55.771 --> 20:57.238
Lieutenant Halloran.

20:57.272 --> 21:00.008
You've been in my employ for six years.

21:00.042 --> 21:02.744
What's my first name?

21:02.778 --> 21:05.179
William asked me on Day One.

21:05.214 --> 21:07.648
Uhh!

21:35.081 --> 21:37.216
Uriel?

21:37.250 --> 21:40.786
Too late. You missed all the fun.

21:40.820 --> 21:44.323
Is that Champagne?

21:44.357 --> 21:47.593
Mm.

21:47.627 --> 21:51.363
Special occasion. Getting my ass kicked.

22:01.074 --> 22:04.076
It's a Juglar.

22:04.110 --> 22:08.547
200 years at the bottom of the sea.

22:08.581 --> 22:11.783
Thought I'd treat myself...

22:11.818 --> 22:14.419
while my wounds healed.

22:18.558 --> 22:22.127
Gabriel laid hands on you for the ledger.

22:22.161 --> 22:25.497
Each and every higher
angel's name and nest.

22:29.435 --> 22:33.939
Which, unfortunately for
me, only lives up here.

22:35.942 --> 22:39.978
You said I was being too sentimental.

22:40.013 --> 22:43.048
But somebody had to
keep track of the family

22:43.082 --> 22:46.818
after the diaspora.

22:46.853 --> 22:49.254
Guess the joke's on me.

22:51.691 --> 22:55.794
Brother threatened to cut off my ears

22:55.828 --> 22:59.064
so I'd never hear Chopin again.

22:59.098 --> 23:01.133
Bastard.

23:01.167 --> 23:02.668
Uriel.

23:02.702 --> 23:05.604
How many neutrals did
you reveal to Gabriel?

23:05.638 --> 23:08.440
Only the ones hidden in Vega.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.343
That's all he wanted.
For recruitment, I assume.

23:11.377 --> 23:14.446
He's murdering them.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.948
How?

23:15.982 --> 23:17.416
Someone they knew got close enough to them

23:17.450 --> 23:19.418
to be able to kill them without a fight.

23:19.452 --> 23:22.020
Perhaps he recruited another
higher to do his dirty work?

23:22.055 --> 23:23.288
And what about possession?

23:23.323 --> 23:25.090
With a lower?

23:25.124 --> 23:27.259
Absolutely.

23:27.293 --> 23:29.094
But a higher angel?

23:29.128 --> 23:31.163
He's not that strong.

23:31.197 --> 23:34.433
Did you try summoning him?

23:34.467 --> 23:37.636
Words are no longer an option.

24:05.898 --> 24:08.400
Not the best neighborhood
to keep your door open,

24:08.434 --> 24:12.070
especially after what happened
in the marketplace this morning.

24:12.105 --> 24:16.308
Tragic.

24:16.342 --> 24:18.910
I'm Louis, by the way.

24:18.945 --> 24:21.346
But I'm sure you already knew that.

24:21.381 --> 24:23.315
And you're right.

24:23.349 --> 24:27.085
I should be more careful.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.855
You're Michael's boy, right?

24:29.889 --> 24:31.890
Mankind's final savior.

24:31.924 --> 24:34.493
Miracle made of flesh and all that.

24:34.527 --> 24:36.862
When I saw those bodies,
I had a feeling Michael

24:36.896 --> 24:39.398
would send you to see me.

24:39.432 --> 24:41.500
Beer?

24:41.534 --> 24:43.101
No.

24:43.136 --> 24:47.039
Tell the other angels they cannot
flee, or they'll be shot down.

24:47.073 --> 24:48.774
Did Michael send you on this errand

24:48.808 --> 24:52.044
and not tell you that we
already know about you?

24:52.078 --> 24:55.113
Oh, well...

24:55.148 --> 24:57.215
he's been keeping secrets for so long,

24:57.250 --> 24:59.184
I'm sure even he has a hard time

24:59.218 --> 25:01.253
remembering what's fact and fiction.

25:01.287 --> 25:03.555
Listen, Michael told me
to tell you to stay put

25:03.589 --> 25:05.357
and to warn the others.

25:05.391 --> 25:07.559
The General's armed the anti-air guns.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.228
You try to go over the wall,
you're gonna get shot down.

25:10.263 --> 25:13.432
Well, I appreciate Michael's concern.

25:13.466 --> 25:17.569
He truly has grown as a person.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.371
What's that supposed to mean?

25:19.405 --> 25:21.573
Ah, you know Michael.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.810
Doesn't like to talk about himself much.

25:24.844 --> 25:29.281
I sure wouldn't if I were
him. But he and I go way back.

25:29.315 --> 25:33.318
I knew him before he changed.

25:33.352 --> 25:35.253
Changed from what?

25:35.288 --> 25:37.456
How familiar are you with something called

25:37.490 --> 25:39.424
The Book of Genesis?

25:39.459 --> 25:43.061
Or any of the older creation myths?

25:43.096 --> 25:44.229
Not much of a reader.

25:44.263 --> 25:46.798
Most have a common thread.

25:46.833 --> 25:49.167
There was a Great Flood
that cleansed the Earth

25:49.202 --> 25:53.939
of all the sinners and
ingrates and hedonists and...

25:53.973 --> 25:56.108
generally everything worth anything.

25:56.142 --> 25:57.876
The Noah story. I've heard of it.

25:57.910 --> 26:01.680
Exactly. Just like with Noah.

26:01.714 --> 26:07.252
Except Noah, the real story...
he wasn't saving animals.

26:07.286 --> 26:10.155
What's this got to do with Michael?

26:10.189 --> 26:12.257
You humans.

26:12.291 --> 26:14.659
You can't wrap your minds around things,

26:14.694 --> 26:18.263
so you make up metaphors like giant floods.

26:18.297 --> 26:22.300
Then those metaphors stick,
and you take them literally.

26:22.335 --> 26:26.605
But trust me. It wasn't an ark Noah built.

26:26.639 --> 26:31.109
It was a bunker to protect people.

26:31.144 --> 26:34.379
Protect people from what?

26:34.413 --> 26:38.216
The real question is...

26:38.251 --> 26:41.419
from whom?

26:53.232 --> 26:55.634
Ouroboros.

26:55.668 --> 26:57.302
Gesundheit.

26:57.336 --> 27:00.105
Ancient cultures worshiped
the symbol Ouroboros.

27:02.041 --> 27:05.310
It's an image of a snake
eating its own tail.

27:05.344 --> 27:07.212
Devouring itself.

27:07.246 --> 27:09.414
Compelled by a hunger it can't control.

27:09.448 --> 27:12.484
See, insights like that tempt me to say

27:12.518 --> 27:15.320
the money used on your
education was well spent.

27:15.354 --> 27:18.356
But feed me to my own lion?

27:18.391 --> 27:20.025
Really?

27:20.059 --> 27:21.493
Use your imagination.

27:21.527 --> 27:23.061
You're the snake, Father.

27:23.095 --> 27:24.829
And the only way for you to survive now

27:24.864 --> 27:28.567
is to end your hunger.

27:28.601 --> 27:29.768
Check the box.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.775
You need to remove that
which you cannot help

27:36.809 --> 27:41.813
but pursue and devour...

27:41.847 --> 27:43.181
David Whele.

27:47.620 --> 27:49.354
You might want to check the cylinder

27:49.388 --> 27:52.991
before you pull that trigger.

28:01.834 --> 28:06.137
A single bullet.

28:06.172 --> 28:08.940
Quite the dilemma.

28:11.611 --> 28:14.446
Come on, this is ludicrous!

28:14.480 --> 28:18.450
Illumination will lead
you to elevation, Father.

28:18.484 --> 28:21.486
You're a man who lost everything.

28:21.520 --> 28:25.490
Who had to prove to the world
that he wasn't just a survivor,

28:25.524 --> 28:29.594
but he could cage the king of the jungle.

28:29.629 --> 28:33.331
But then he became your sigil, your brand.

28:33.366 --> 28:35.300
Samson is David Whele's

28:35.334 --> 28:39.070
ultimate act of self-deification.

28:39.105 --> 28:42.574
You spent your entire
life chasing this idea...

28:42.608 --> 28:45.310
consuming and devouring yourself

28:45.344 --> 28:46.845
like Ouroboros.

28:46.879 --> 28:48.947
Come on, William. Get me out of here!

28:48.981 --> 28:50.749
It's time to let go, Father.

28:50.783 --> 28:54.152
Only then will your soul
be open to salvation.

28:54.186 --> 28:56.087
I don't need saving!

28:56.122 --> 28:57.789
We all need saving.

28:57.823 --> 29:02.427
You can break my ribs, starve
me, feed me to the lions,

29:02.461 --> 29:07.299
but I will not bow down before any man.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.301
Not to any angel!

29:09.335 --> 29:13.438
I'd rather be torn apart and eaten alive!

29:27.353 --> 29:31.256
Your mother would be ashamed.

29:33.192 --> 29:35.927
Yes. She would.

30:00.411 --> 30:02.178
Hey.

30:02.212 --> 30:03.446
Where you been?

30:03.480 --> 30:05.848
Finch is on my ass about you.

30:05.883 --> 30:09.318
I'm running out of cover stories.

30:09.353 --> 30:11.354
Running errands for Michael.

30:11.388 --> 30:13.389
- I'm on shift in 30.
- Okay.

30:13.424 --> 30:14.791
Wait.

30:14.825 --> 30:17.460
The Bible?

30:17.494 --> 30:20.997
Was I really that bad that
I drove you to religion?

30:21.031 --> 30:23.900
No.

30:27.938 --> 30:30.840
Hey.

30:30.874 --> 30:34.377
You know you can always trust me.

30:34.411 --> 30:36.546
Yeah.

30:36.580 --> 30:39.816
You know... It's just something

30:39.850 --> 30:41.484
someone said. This guy earlier.

30:41.518 --> 30:43.553
What?

30:46.423 --> 30:49.425
Have you ever thought,

30:49.460 --> 30:54.063
how well do we really know Michael?

30:54.098 --> 30:57.400
I mean, really.

30:57.434 --> 30:59.435
What do you mean?

31:02.740 --> 31:04.407
This tattoo.

31:04.441 --> 31:07.610
It reads, "Beware those closest to you."

31:09.580 --> 31:10.580
And with everything this guy said...

31:10.614 --> 31:13.282
- Noma, we have to go.
- I...

31:13.317 --> 31:15.685
- Uh...
- Go, go.

31:15.719 --> 31:17.253
Can we talk about this later?

31:17.287 --> 31:20.123
- Yeah.
- Sorry, Alex.

31:30.768 --> 31:34.036
So, uh, you and Nomes.

31:34.071 --> 31:36.773
Like a "Back How It Used
to Be" serious thing,

31:36.807 --> 31:39.542
or a "Much Needed Romp
After Claire" kind of thing?

31:39.576 --> 31:40.910
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:40.944 --> 31:42.411
I'm talking about those noises

31:42.446 --> 31:44.113
coming from the supply closet last night.

31:47.151 --> 31:49.719
- Lannon.
- It's Louis.

31:49.753 --> 31:51.587
- How'd you get this channel?
- Please.

31:51.622 --> 31:53.756
I need you to meet me at the Stratosphere.

31:53.791 --> 31:55.424
It's an emergency.

31:55.459 --> 31:58.127
And please come alone.

32:00.998 --> 32:04.934
Everything all right?

32:09.506 --> 32:11.841
Louis?

32:11.875 --> 32:16.712
Louis?

32:20.150 --> 32:21.450
What's the emergency?

32:21.485 --> 32:24.153
I needed to see Michael, but he isn't here.

32:24.188 --> 32:27.490
Well, he'll be back soon,
but you shouldn't be here.

32:27.524 --> 32:28.825
Oh, don't you get it?

32:28.859 --> 32:32.695
This is the safest place for me to be.

32:32.729 --> 32:36.766
Why?

32:36.800 --> 32:39.335
Because I know who the killer is.

32:40.737 --> 32:41.771
Louis?

32:45.175 --> 32:46.609
Louis, you shouldn't be up here.

32:46.643 --> 32:49.312
Noma?

32:49.346 --> 32:51.380
What are you doing here?

32:51.415 --> 32:55.051
Alex.

32:55.085 --> 32:56.652
I called her.

32:56.687 --> 32:59.121
Don't you see?

32:59.156 --> 33:02.291
She's here to teach you a lesson.

33:02.326 --> 33:03.793
Teach me a lesson about what?

33:03.827 --> 33:05.628
Why none of you should trust Michael.

33:05.662 --> 33:08.865
Louis. Louis, don't.

33:08.899 --> 33:13.836
I suppose the proof is always
in the pudding, isn't it?

33:14.938 --> 33:18.307
Noma, no!

33:18.342 --> 33:19.809
- Aah!
- Noma!

33:39.420 --> 33:41.688
You told me you'd never lie to me.

33:41.723 --> 33:43.824
- I didn't lie to you.
- Right.

33:43.858 --> 33:47.327
You just neglected to tell me
that one of my closest friends,

33:47.361 --> 33:51.932
one of the last people I really
cared about in this damn place,

33:51.966 --> 33:54.935
the one person I really trusted...

33:54.969 --> 33:58.171
the one person... is a higher angel.

33:58.205 --> 34:02.275
You can still trust her.

34:02.310 --> 34:05.212
Did your spy know who I was before I did?

34:05.246 --> 34:07.214
She wasn't a spy. I simply
needed you protected.

34:07.248 --> 34:08.215
Protected from who?

34:08.248 --> 34:09.516
Yourself!

34:11.585 --> 34:12.953
You wouldn't need looking after

34:12.987 --> 34:14.920
if you weren't such a reckless mess.

34:14.956 --> 34:18.391
I may be a reckless mess,
but at least I know who I am!

34:18.426 --> 34:20.092
Who the hell are you?

34:20.128 --> 34:21.228
I'm the one that's been watching over you

34:21.262 --> 34:23.797
your entire life.

34:23.831 --> 34:25.599
Waiting for you to step up to the promise

34:25.632 --> 34:27.300
that's been woven into
every ounce of your being

34:27.335 --> 34:28.735
by divine will.

34:28.770 --> 34:30.871
And here we are on the precipice,

34:30.905 --> 34:32.973
on the brink of everything
we've been working for...

34:33.007 --> 34:35.308
struggling for...

34:35.342 --> 34:37.043
and you question my motives?

34:38.279 --> 34:40.347
You shut up!

34:42.583 --> 34:43.917
It's hard not to.

34:43.951 --> 34:47.053
This isn't about humans versus angels.

34:47.088 --> 34:51.324
This is about what's
right and what's wrong.

34:51.359 --> 34:52.826
This is about guilt, isn't it?

34:52.860 --> 34:53.860
Bravo.

34:57.799 --> 34:59.065
You murdered them.

34:59.100 --> 35:02.002
- I did.
- They were neutral.

35:02.036 --> 35:04.171
Neutrality is a myth propagated by those

35:04.205 --> 35:06.039
of thin conviction...

35:06.073 --> 35:08.975
And even weaker constitution.

35:11.779 --> 35:14.781
Gabriel.

35:14.816 --> 35:17.184
Hello, brother.

35:17.218 --> 35:19.085
He can possess higher angels now?

35:19.120 --> 35:21.087
Well, I've been practicing.

35:21.122 --> 35:23.190
You'd be surprised at
what you're capable of

35:23.224 --> 35:24.591
if you set your mind to it.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.426
You've sunk to a new low, brother.

35:26.460 --> 35:29.196
It's the only way I
could tell the chosen one

35:29.230 --> 35:31.932
the truth about you.

35:38.573 --> 35:42.275
Your path should not be led
by a misguided archangel, Alex.

35:42.310 --> 35:43.944
It should be led by me!

35:43.978 --> 35:45.011
I'd kill you right now if you weren't using

35:45.046 --> 35:46.446
an innocent body as a shield.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.148
Innocence is in the eye of the beholder.

35:48.182 --> 35:50.217
This body was happy to sell produce

35:50.251 --> 35:52.118
while a war was waged in his behalf.

35:52.153 --> 35:53.553
You slaughtered them
because they were pacifists.

35:53.588 --> 35:56.223
They were sacrificed for a greater cause...

35:56.257 --> 36:00.160
to finally shake this
city's blind faith in you.

36:00.194 --> 36:02.729
Yeah, he's a deceitful bastard, Alex,

36:02.763 --> 36:04.998
who's been hiding you from me.

36:05.032 --> 36:08.535
Sanctify this vessel.

36:10.438 --> 36:15.909
Sanctify this vessel.

36:15.943 --> 36:17.644
An eviction?

36:17.678 --> 36:19.613
What year is it again?

36:19.647 --> 36:22.382
Sanctify this vessel.

36:22.416 --> 36:25.252
Oh, this is adorable.

36:25.286 --> 36:26.519
It truly is.

36:26.554 --> 36:29.089
Sanctify this vessel.

36:31.225 --> 36:34.294
- Ha ha...
- Sanctify this vessel.

36:37.098 --> 36:39.566
Sanctify this vessel!

36:39.600 --> 36:42.102
I love your ambition.

36:42.136 --> 36:43.637
- Sanctify...
- But...

36:43.671 --> 36:45.505
- this vessel.
- you do know who I am?

36:45.539 --> 36:46.539
I believe he does.

36:46.574 --> 36:48.341
Sanctify this vessel!

36:48.376 --> 36:51.511
I...

36:51.545 --> 36:52.879
Sanctify.

36:54.582 --> 36:57.183
Sanctify.

37:17.338 --> 37:19.472
Back so soon?

37:19.507 --> 37:23.810
It seems... Michael has taught the boy

37:23.844 --> 37:26.446
how to perform an eviction.

37:33.287 --> 37:37.590
So he truly is the chosen one, isn't he?

37:37.625 --> 37:40.961
Yes.

37:40.995 --> 37:42.562
And the dead?

37:42.596 --> 37:44.931
Was killing three of our own worth it?

37:44.966 --> 37:47.467
It certainly wound up Michael.

37:47.501 --> 37:50.603
Won't be long until we have
another flood on our hands.

39:13.898 --> 39:16.666
They knew the guns were
trained on them, yet they fled,

39:16.701 --> 39:18.735
shot down before they
could clear the walls.

39:18.769 --> 39:22.339
Something tells me Gabriel
didn't deliver your message.

39:22.373 --> 39:24.708
Are these all of them?

39:24.742 --> 39:29.245
With the exception of Noma, yes.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.682
Michael.

39:32.717 --> 39:38.288
Your brother told me things about you.

39:38.322 --> 39:41.725
Things about your past.

39:41.759 --> 39:44.794
About the Flood.

39:46.731 --> 39:50.567
Is it true?

39:50.601 --> 39:52.869
Michael. Is it true?

39:52.903 --> 39:55.905
Don't listen to my brother.

39:55.940 --> 39:58.274
Hey, I'm still talking to you!

39:58.309 --> 39:59.643
We're not done here!

39:59.677 --> 40:01.144
You hear me?

40:11.300 --> 40:13.050
_

40:24.001 --> 40:26.503
Let the boy go!

40:31.600 --> 40:32.725
_

40:37.548 --> 40:41.017
Father's Great Flood,
sent to cleanse the Earth.

40:41.052 --> 40:43.820
Let every nation tremble before his might.

40:43.854 --> 40:46.790
They've begun to worship
our kind over Father.

40:46.824 --> 40:48.324
He'll never let that abide.

40:48.359 --> 40:50.126
So you kill them?

40:50.161 --> 40:52.128
Every man, woman, and child?

40:52.163 --> 40:54.164
It's what he asked me to do.

40:54.198 --> 40:59.402
Father always taught us never
to leave our chores unfinished.

41:01.872 --> 41:03.206
Stop.

41:03.240 --> 41:04.841
Of all the pleasures this world

41:04.875 --> 41:07.877
makes available to us, he chooses murder?

41:07.912 --> 41:11.481
I'm just ensuring the
natural order of things.

41:14.151 --> 41:17.487
And what's more natural than death?
