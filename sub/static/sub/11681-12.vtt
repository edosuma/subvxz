00:00.319 --> 00:03.953
<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.543 --> 00:07.078
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.146 --> 00:09.514
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.582 --> 00:12.183
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:12.251 --> 00:14.552
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.620 --> 00:16.588
Where am I?
Miami.

00:16.655 --> 00:19.824
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.892 --> 00:22.460
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.528 --> 00:24.062
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.130 --> 00:25.697
Should we shoot them?

00:25.764 --> 00:28.266
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:28.334 --> 00:30.668
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.736 --> 00:33.204
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:33.272 --> 00:35.373
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.441 --> 00:37.876
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.943 --> 00:39.544
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:42.915 --> 00:44.516
<i>Previously on "Burn Notice"...</i>

00:44.583 --> 00:46.284
Assassinations...

00:46.352 --> 00:47.519
Little wars
around the world.

00:47.586 --> 00:49.921
Whoever's behind
all of this

00:49.989 --> 00:52.056
was being investigated
by a counterintelligence Agent

00:52.124 --> 00:53.525
named Jesse Porter.

00:53.592 --> 00:54.959
I need you
to get his files.

00:55.027 --> 00:56.761
Mike, that guy whose files
you stole --

00:56.829 --> 00:58.129
he's being blacklisted.

00:58.197 --> 00:59.430
You just burned a spy.

00:59.498 --> 01:01.533
Maybe I could help you.
Why would you do that?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.001
Burned spies
need to stick together.

01:03.068 --> 01:05.036
So, your search
for the root of all evil

01:05.104 --> 01:06.304
led you to rob a bank,

01:06.372 --> 01:08.873
and you're rewarded
with the word of God.

01:08.941 --> 01:10.808
It's a book code,
a cipher.

01:10.876 --> 01:13.344
Jesse's been working on
this investigation for years.

01:13.412 --> 01:15.280
This little baby
connects all the dots.

01:15.347 --> 01:17.215
Everything leads back
to John Barrett.

01:17.283 --> 01:18.483
Why didn't I
put this together?

01:18.551 --> 01:20.585
It's great cover running
a telecom conglomerate.

01:20.653 --> 01:22.554
It gets Barrett into
every corner of the globe.

01:22.621 --> 01:24.355
If you want the bible,
Mr. Barrett,

01:24.423 --> 01:25.723
you have to get on
a plane.

01:25.791 --> 01:27.625
I just got off one, son.

01:27.693 --> 01:28.960
I'll be in touch.

01:29.028 --> 01:30.528
Michael burned me.

01:30.596 --> 01:31.729
And you all helped
cover it up.

01:31.797 --> 01:32.830
Goodbye, Fiona.

01:34.400 --> 01:36.234
Jesse found out --

01:36.302 --> 01:37.368
about everything.

01:37.436 --> 01:38.803
I think
he's gonna make us pay.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

01:47.813 --> 01:51.149
Well, I almost made it to Tampa,
but you called, and I came.

01:51.217 --> 01:52.650
Perimeter's clear.

01:52.718 --> 01:53.751
No sign of Jesse.

01:53.819 --> 01:55.486
Looks like he left
in a hurry.

01:55.554 --> 01:59.090
Well, he was on his way
to Michael's place to shoot him.

01:59.158 --> 02:00.558
I doubt
he was too concerned

02:00.626 --> 02:02.560
about packing
all his undershirts.

02:02.628 --> 02:03.661
So what now?

02:05.297 --> 02:07.432
The situation
hasn't changed.

02:07.499 --> 02:09.734
We found Barrett.
He's in Miami.

02:09.801 --> 02:12.036
We grab him,
and we ask him some questions.

02:12.104 --> 02:13.371
Michael?

02:13.439 --> 02:16.174
Jesse vowed
to put a bullet in you.

02:16.242 --> 02:18.643
That should put him
at the top of your to-do list.

02:18.711 --> 02:20.845
There's not a whole lot
I can do about that right now.

02:20.913 --> 02:22.747
And the fact is,
if we don't get to Barrett,

02:22.815 --> 02:25.183
Jesse's life will be ruined
for nothing.

02:25.251 --> 02:27.819
Mom,
under the circumstances,

02:27.886 --> 02:30.421
you might go ahead
and take that trip out of town.

02:30.489 --> 02:31.990
Jesse and I
were friends.

02:32.057 --> 02:34.492
Maybe I'll stay and try and
convince him not to shoot you.

02:36.061 --> 02:38.663
Let's go, Fi.
Sam's waiting.

02:46.205 --> 02:47.238
Well, this is where he is.

02:47.306 --> 02:48.506
Kind of tough to hide

02:48.574 --> 02:50.074
when you're renting
a high-security compound

02:50.142 --> 02:51.576
and guarding it
with a small army.

02:51.644 --> 02:53.878
Not bad.
20 grand a day.

02:53.946 --> 02:55.813
Guess there wasn't room
at the Best Western.

02:55.881 --> 02:57.615
Are you sure you want to do it
this way, Michael?

02:57.683 --> 02:58.950
If you just want to send
a message to the guy,

02:59.018 --> 03:00.551
there are other ways.

03:00.619 --> 03:03.054
Barrett needs to know I'm someone
he needs to take seriously.

03:03.122 --> 03:04.455
Okay, so, Mike,

03:04.523 --> 03:06.524
beyond 10 feet,
you're kind of pushing it here,

03:06.592 --> 03:08.426
so don't use that thing
unless you're close.

03:08.494 --> 03:10.728
Hit him in both eyes --
he'll be stumbling blind.

03:10.796 --> 03:12.230
We'll cover you
the best we can.

03:17.903 --> 03:20.805
<i>The native American practice</i>
<i>of counting coup</i>

03:20.873 --> 03:23.875
<i>involved touching enemies</i>
<i>on the battlefield.</i>

03:23.942 --> 03:25.710
<i>The object wasn't to do damage</i>

03:25.778 --> 03:28.880
<i>but to establish</i>
<i>your superiority as a warrior.</i>

03:28.947 --> 03:32.350
<i>Infiltrating someone's security</i>
<i>can serve a similar function.</i>

03:32.418 --> 03:34.385
<i>It's a not-so-subtle way</i>
<i>of saying,</i>

03:34.453 --> 03:36.287
<i>"hi. I'm not here to hurt you"...</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

03:37.890 --> 03:40.892
<i>..."But I could hurt you</i>
<i>very badly if I chose to."</i>

03:40.959 --> 03:42.694
You want to get out of this
alive, you will <i>not</i> move.

03:44.530 --> 03:46.798
Hello? Hello, everyone.

03:46.865 --> 03:48.232
This is Michael Westen.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.735
I want to talk to John Barrett,
please. Now.

03:50.803 --> 03:53.404
It's Michael Westen,
sir.

03:53.472 --> 03:56.741
He's on the premises.

03:56.809 --> 03:59.344
Good evening, Mr. Westen.

03:59.411 --> 04:03.014
You have a very interesting way
of welcoming people to Miami.

04:03.082 --> 04:05.016
Well, for an international
power player like yourself,

04:05.084 --> 04:06.284
I wanted
to do something special.

04:06.352 --> 04:07.618
I'm flattered.

04:11.190 --> 04:14.392
You want to tell me why
you're attacking my bodyguards?

04:14.460 --> 04:16.293
I just want
to make this clear --

04:16.362 --> 04:17.528
you will
take me seriously.

04:17.596 --> 04:20.932
Mission accomplished.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.667
Don't get <i>too</i> cocky,
though.

04:22.735 --> 04:24.836
Right now you have
10 high-powered rifles

04:24.903 --> 04:26.003
trained on you.

04:26.071 --> 04:27.438
If you try anything stupid,

04:27.506 --> 04:29.841
you will quickly be reduced
to a nasty red stain

04:29.908 --> 04:31.809
on my nice green lawn.

04:31.877 --> 04:34.979
Nobody is making a move.
I just want to talk.

04:35.047 --> 04:36.080
Good.

04:36.148 --> 04:37.415
Now that we understand
each other,

04:37.483 --> 04:39.384
let's talk about my bible.

04:39.451 --> 04:41.419
For the moment,
it is <i>my</i> bible.

04:41.487 --> 04:42.520
You want it?

04:42.588 --> 04:44.389
You will meet me
at Donner Key,

04:44.456 --> 04:45.957
North end,
noon Tuesday.

04:46.024 --> 04:48.726
What, exactly,
do you expect in return?

04:48.794 --> 04:52.630
We both know that the bible
is a basis for a book code.

04:52.698 --> 04:55.800
First, I want to know
what it decodes.

04:55.868 --> 04:57.902
And then we can talk
about our future together.

04:57.970 --> 05:00.171
Our future <i>together?</i>

05:00.239 --> 05:02.774
Yeah. I was thinking
you might want to hire me on.

05:02.841 --> 05:04.742
You could <i>really</i> use
some new staff.

05:06.897 --> 05:10.617
<font color=#00FFFF>Burn Notice 4x12</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>Guilty as Charged</font>
<font color=#FFFFFF>Original Air Date on August 26, 2010</font>

05:10.817 --> 05:14.317
-- Sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> --
-- for <font color=#00FFFF>www.addic7ed.com</font> --

05:15.470 --> 05:17.671
it's impressive work,
Michael.

05:17.739 --> 05:19.940
When you said you could get
John Barrett down to Miami

05:20.008 --> 05:22.209
and snatch him yourself,
I thought you were dreaming.

05:22.277 --> 05:24.512
If we're gonna be partners
on this job,

05:24.579 --> 05:26.614
you need to know --
I keep my promises.

05:26.681 --> 05:28.049
I expect you
to keep yours.

05:28.116 --> 05:29.316
Of course.

05:33.155 --> 05:35.089
So...When does
this all happen?

05:35.157 --> 05:36.557
It goes down Tuesday.

05:36.625 --> 05:39.493
I'm putting together
the equipment and the plan now.

05:41.329 --> 05:44.098
Speaking of plans
and equipment,

05:44.166 --> 05:45.533
let's talk
about Jesse Porter.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.902
I have reports that he's been
reaching out to old contacts

05:47.969 --> 05:49.270
in the intelligence world.

05:49.337 --> 05:51.372
Nothing you need to worry about.
Yeah?

05:51.440 --> 05:53.174
But we can't have him
in the wind, Michael.

05:53.241 --> 05:54.708
He's either with us
or against us.

05:54.776 --> 05:56.977
Now, you want me to take care of him?
I'll handle it.

05:57.045 --> 05:58.312
Well, be sure you do,
Michael.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.014
'Cause this little project
is a lot bigger

06:00.082 --> 06:01.348
than you <i>or</i> Jesse Porter.

06:01.416 --> 06:03.284
John Barrett
and his organization

06:03.351 --> 06:05.653
have been wreaking havoc
all over the globe.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.254
They've been
killing civilians,

06:07.322 --> 06:08.923
killing spies,
and killing <i>my</i> people.

06:08.990 --> 06:10.491
And this is
the closest we've come

06:10.559 --> 06:12.093
to cutting the head
off the beast.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.961
We are <i>not</i> gonna
let him get away.

06:14.029 --> 06:15.362
Understood?

06:15.430 --> 06:17.431
Understood.

06:23.105 --> 06:24.472
Okay, wait,
wait, wait.

06:24.539 --> 06:26.674
Just so we're sure here,
you're not actually planning

06:26.741 --> 06:29.076
on turning this Barrett
character over to Vaughn, right?

06:29.144 --> 06:31.712
No. Once we <i>get</i> Barrett,
we can go to the CIA, the FBI.

06:31.780 --> 06:33.380
He's a pretty big
card to play.

06:33.448 --> 06:34.949
You think it's enough
to get Jesse back in?

06:35.016 --> 06:36.283
It's the only chance
he's got.

06:36.351 --> 06:38.786
Good. Because I have to say,
Michael,

06:38.854 --> 06:41.388
I hate it when my friends
kill each other.

06:41.456 --> 06:43.424
Excuse me.
Mr. Westen?

06:43.492 --> 06:45.259
Yes?
I work for Adam Scott.

06:45.327 --> 06:47.561
If you don't mind, I need
to discuss something with you.

06:47.629 --> 06:48.629
Adam Scott?

06:49.764 --> 06:51.398
He's a big-time
defense attorney.

06:51.466 --> 06:53.100
Represents
half the scumbags in Miami.

06:54.603 --> 06:56.003
Mr. Scott
needs to speak with you.

06:56.071 --> 06:58.506
He has
an urgent situation.

06:58.573 --> 07:01.275
That money's yours just for hearing him out.
There's a car waiting.

07:01.343 --> 07:04.278
Sorry. I don't get into cars
with people I don't know

07:04.346 --> 07:06.647
without a good reason.

07:06.715 --> 07:08.382
Mr. Scott's daughter's
been kidnapped.

07:08.450 --> 07:10.217
She's 5 years old.

07:10.285 --> 07:11.752
He needs your help.

07:11.820 --> 07:12.653
Now.

07:16.224 --> 07:18.392
Well, in that case...

07:23.331 --> 07:25.399
They took Becky
right out of the backyard.

07:27.302 --> 07:28.469
Men with machine guns.

07:28.537 --> 07:31.205
She's 5 years old.

07:31.273 --> 07:33.140
My ex wants
to call the FBI.

07:33.208 --> 07:34.441
I convinced her
to hold off, but...

07:34.509 --> 07:35.910
Do you have any idea
who did it?

07:35.977 --> 07:37.178
I know <i>exactly</i>
<i>who did it.</i>

07:37.245 --> 07:40.014
He's one of my clients.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.184
Rod Lawson.

07:43.251 --> 07:45.519
He runs
the Carol City Gang.

07:45.587 --> 07:47.454
They run drug
and protection rackets

07:47.522 --> 07:49.023
throughout the southeast.

07:49.090 --> 07:51.759
He's on trial for murder.

07:51.826 --> 07:53.360
The verdict
comes in Monday.

07:53.428 --> 07:56.230
So he decided he needed
a little insurance?

07:56.298 --> 07:59.233
His brother, Dale,

07:59.301 --> 08:02.102
contacted me the day after
they snatched Becky.

08:02.170 --> 08:04.138
He said...

08:04.206 --> 08:05.739
If we lose,
they'll kill her.

08:05.807 --> 08:06.974
Since I'm here,

08:07.042 --> 08:09.543
I assume the trial
isn't going well?

08:09.611 --> 08:12.146
The evidence
is overwhelming.

08:12.214 --> 08:14.048
Rod is going to lose.

08:14.115 --> 08:18.252
How exactly did you find me,
Mr. Scott?

08:18.320 --> 08:20.821
I'm a defense attorney,
Mr. Westen.

08:20.889 --> 08:23.023
I know Miami's underworld.

08:23.091 --> 08:25.793
Your associate,
Barry Burkowski --

08:25.860 --> 08:27.995
he mentioned you.

08:28.063 --> 08:31.699
When clients need to pay cash,
he helps arrange...Things.

08:31.766 --> 08:33.299
Did it ever occur to you

08:33.368 --> 08:36.703
that representing people who
pay their legal bills in <i>cash</i>

08:36.770 --> 08:38.304
isn't the safest profession?

08:38.373 --> 08:40.441
I'm not a Saint,
Mr. Westen.

08:40.508 --> 08:41.375
Neither are you.

08:42.644 --> 08:47.114
Becky's 5 years old.

08:47.182 --> 08:48.749
And I'm
running out of time.

08:52.520 --> 08:53.754
Set up
a meeting with Dale.

08:53.822 --> 08:55.723
Tell him you're working
on getting his brother

08:55.790 --> 08:57.091
and that we need to meet

08:57.158 --> 08:59.293
to negotiate the terms
of Becky's release.

08:59.361 --> 09:01.161
He needs to bring proof of life
to the meeting.

09:01.229 --> 09:02.763
You'll help me, then?

09:02.831 --> 09:04.598
No. I'll help <i>her.</i>

09:13.842 --> 09:15.242
The girl's fine.

09:15.310 --> 09:18.145
That's "Wake Up, Miami"
this morning, channel 3.

09:18.213 --> 09:19.747
Check the listings
if you want.

09:19.814 --> 09:21.982
Her face looks...Swollen.

09:22.050 --> 09:23.984
Did you
put your hands on her?

09:24.052 --> 09:25.786
Nobody touched her.

09:25.854 --> 09:27.855
She's been cryin'.

09:27.922 --> 09:30.658
You want her to stop?
Get my brother out of jail.

09:30.725 --> 09:34.361
Look, we both stand
to lose somebody here.

09:34.429 --> 09:37.731
I'm just a devoted family man,
like yourself.

09:40.335 --> 09:41.669
I told you,

09:41.736 --> 09:43.370
I-I can't just get someone
out of jail like that.

09:43.438 --> 09:45.306
You know what? You were
a hell of a lot more confident

09:45.373 --> 09:47.141
when you were taking
a million-dollar retainer.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.309
Figure it out.

09:48.376 --> 09:50.611
You son of a bitch!
That's enough.

09:52.113 --> 09:53.981
And who are you, again?
Call me Joseph.

09:54.049 --> 09:54.982
Okay, Joseph.

09:55.050 --> 09:56.750
What are you doing here?

09:56.818 --> 09:59.687
My job...Is to get
Mr. Scott's daughter back.

09:59.754 --> 10:01.855
Well, I think I made it clear
how that happens --

10:01.923 --> 10:05.259
Mr. Scott here needs
to do the job he was paid to do.

10:05.327 --> 10:07.194
With the evidence
against your brother,

10:07.262 --> 10:08.595
you don't need a lawyer.

10:08.663 --> 10:10.998
You need a miracle worker.
And that's what I am.

10:11.066 --> 10:12.466
And what's that
supposed to mean?

10:12.534 --> 10:14.968
Getting your brother out of jail
is going to require --

10:15.036 --> 10:16.236
well, let's just call it

10:16.304 --> 10:18.305
a "shift in
the legal circumstances."

10:18.373 --> 10:20.107
That's <i>my</i> job.
The less you know, the better.

10:20.175 --> 10:22.376
Well, I don't
see it that way, Joseph.

10:22.444 --> 10:23.610
That's my brother,

10:23.678 --> 10:25.312
and I want to know
everything that happens.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.481
Well, I guess you're gonna be
disappointed, then.

10:27.549 --> 10:29.350
Stay in touch.

10:43.932 --> 10:45.566
What the hell
did <i>that</i> accomplish?

10:45.633 --> 10:47.134
Dale isn't gonna
deat with me

10:47.202 --> 10:49.002
without trying to figure out
who I am.

10:49.070 --> 10:51.605
If he's any good at his job,
he'll have someone tail me.

10:51.673 --> 10:53.073
We I.D. the tail,

10:53.141 --> 10:55.142
and we can use that
to find your daughter.

10:55.210 --> 10:56.210
You better be sure.

10:56.277 --> 10:57.878
This isn't
the kind of situation

10:57.946 --> 10:59.513
where you can be sure
about anything.

10:59.581 --> 11:00.848
It's the best option
we have.

11:00.915 --> 11:03.016
Now, they're probably
watching us right now,

11:03.084 --> 11:04.318
so shake my hand.

11:04.386 --> 11:07.187
Go to your car.
Let me do my job.

11:22.103 --> 11:25.506
<i>One simple but effective trick</i>
<i>for identifying a tail</i>

11:25.573 --> 11:28.776
<i>is known in the spy trade</i>
<i>as "running errands."</i>

11:28.843 --> 11:32.212
<i>You drive to different</i>
<i>locations and stop,</i>

11:32.247 --> 11:35.816
<i>going about ordinary business</i>
<i>in areas with open parking lots</i>

11:35.884 --> 11:37.985
<i>while your team follows,</i>

11:38.052 --> 11:40.187
<i>keeping track of the cars</i>
<i>at each stop.</i>

11:40.255 --> 11:42.623
<i>It doesn't matter how good</i>
<i>your tail is.</i>

11:42.690 --> 11:43.957
<i>At a certain point,</i>

11:44.025 --> 11:47.394
<i>they're going to pop up</i>
<i>more than once.</i>

11:47.462 --> 11:49.696
Yeah, Mike, we got him.
It's a black Audi.

11:49.764 --> 11:52.065
The guy's pretty good.
I only saw him once before.

11:52.133 --> 11:53.367
Nice work.

11:53.435 --> 11:55.436
I'll abandon the car
and take the bus home.

11:55.503 --> 11:57.137
When he figures out
he's lost me and leaves,

11:57.205 --> 11:58.705
follow him back
to wherever he came from.

11:58.773 --> 12:00.107
Rightey-o.

12:05.647 --> 12:07.614
A lot of people
coming and going

12:07.682 --> 12:09.249
for a nightclub
during the day.

12:09.317 --> 12:10.818
Well,
I think we found H.Q.

12:10.885 --> 12:12.419
So, Fi,
think you can handle

12:12.487 --> 12:14.521
the pistol-packing
parking attendant there?

12:15.824 --> 12:16.990
Just asking.

12:17.058 --> 12:18.525
All right, so, look,
I'll go up the side there.

12:18.593 --> 12:19.860
You keep him occupied

12:19.928 --> 12:21.929
'cause if he figures out
what we're doing out here...

12:21.996 --> 12:23.330
A little girl dies.

12:23.398 --> 12:24.598
Yeah.
I know.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.434
Hi.

12:27.502 --> 12:30.471
Yeah, I was here
super late last night,

12:30.538 --> 12:32.506
and I lost my sunglasses.

12:32.574 --> 12:34.441
Last night?
I don't work nights. Sorry.

12:34.509 --> 12:36.543
We, is there someone
that you can ask?

12:36.611 --> 12:38.545
I mean, I would <i>really</i>
<i>appreciate it.</i>

12:38.613 --> 12:40.113
They're my favorite
glasses.

12:40.181 --> 12:42.182
Seriously, I don't think there's
anything I could do for you.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.884
Maybe...Come back tonight,

12:43.952 --> 12:46.186
talk to the manager,
the bouncer.

12:46.254 --> 12:49.223
Oh. Come on, sweetie.
You really can't help?

12:49.290 --> 12:51.692
Lady, look,
I said Ian't help you.

12:51.759 --> 12:53.527
I'm not even supposed to
be talking to you,

12:53.595 --> 12:55.462
so if you don't mind,
take a walk, all right?

12:55.530 --> 12:56.763
Don't be like that.

12:58.633 --> 13:00.734
Are you -- are you,
like, blowing me off?

13:00.802 --> 13:02.503
Look, Lady, I don't know
what your problem is,

13:02.570 --> 13:04.705
but I don't know anything
about your stupid glasses.

13:04.772 --> 13:05.939
And quit
flattering yourself

13:06.007 --> 13:07.541
'cause you're not my type,
all right?

13:07.609 --> 13:08.675
I'm not your type?!

13:08.743 --> 13:10.310
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?!

13:10.378 --> 13:11.712
I like blondes, all right?
Now get lost.

13:11.779 --> 13:13.080
Well, you know what?
What?

13:13.147 --> 13:14.214
I prefer gentlemen.

13:15.116 --> 13:15.916
Ahh!

13:24.025 --> 13:26.627
Nice job, butterfingers.
You almost got us killed.

13:26.694 --> 13:27.895
Me? You're the one

13:27.962 --> 13:29.963
who was supposed to be
handling the guy.

13:30.031 --> 13:32.399
You know, I got to put trackers
on 10 of Dale's guy's cars.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.001
You know, the only thing
holding me up

13:34.068 --> 13:35.903
was that you couldn't control
a parking attendant.

13:35.970 --> 13:37.437
I controlled him
just fine.

13:37.505 --> 13:39.139
It's not my fault
he was rude!

13:39.207 --> 13:40.674
That was
a command performance!

13:40.742 --> 13:42.509
Uh, Fi?

13:42.577 --> 13:43.977
Looks like
your performance

13:44.045 --> 13:45.946
had more of an audience
than we thought.

13:47.115 --> 13:48.315
Jesse?

13:48.383 --> 13:49.516
Jesse!

13:53.263 --> 13:55.083
<i>You can learn a lot
from patterns of movement.</i>

13:57.466 --> 13:59.934
<i>Much like a hunter</i>
<i>follows animal footprints</i>

14:00.002 --> 14:02.770
<i>to find where the animal</i>
<i>sleeps, feeds, and mates,</i>

14:02.838 --> 14:04.772
<i>a spy can examine</i>
<i>vehicle trails</i>

14:04.840 --> 14:07.508
<i>to find out where a target</i>
<i>lives, does business,</i>

14:07.576 --> 14:09.744
<i>and hides the things</i>
<i>he doesn't want found.</i>

14:12.981 --> 14:14.115
How'd we do?

14:14.183 --> 14:16.050
Well, we planted 10 trackers
on the cars.

14:16.118 --> 14:19.187
Most of them belong to regular
criminal employee types,

14:19.254 --> 14:21.822
so, you know, they're going to
their restaurants

14:21.890 --> 14:23.457
and the drug neighborhoods,

14:23.525 --> 14:25.426
but a few of them
took a big detour.

14:27.663 --> 14:29.764
All through here, trying to make
sure they weren't followed,

14:29.831 --> 14:31.132
all the way out here.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.500
I mean, there's nothing
around that for miles.

14:32.568 --> 14:35.303
Looks like a good place
to stash a kidnapping victim.

14:35.370 --> 14:36.571
Where's Fi?

14:36.638 --> 14:38.406
Uh, I was gonna
talk to you about that.

14:38.473 --> 14:40.575
We saw Jesse when we were
planting the trackers.

14:40.642 --> 14:42.076
It didn't look friendly.

14:42.144 --> 14:44.111
Anyway, she's out
trying to find him.

14:44.179 --> 14:45.179
And?

14:45.247 --> 14:47.448
And he's nowhere.

14:49.818 --> 14:51.419
Let's just focus
on what's in front of us.

14:51.486 --> 14:52.853
How can we
get to the girl?

14:52.921 --> 14:55.323
Well, any land approach
is gonna be visible for miles,

14:55.390 --> 14:57.291
and approaching by boat
is just as bad

14:57.359 --> 14:58.960
'cause they can see
the whole Bay.

14:59.027 --> 15:00.761
No boat. No car.

15:00.829 --> 15:03.864
I guess we'll just have to
figure out something else.

15:09.104 --> 15:11.339
You found her?
What are we doing here, then?

15:11.406 --> 15:13.407
We should be going in --
we can't just go in guns ablaze.

15:13.475 --> 15:14.942
You don't understand,
Mr. Westen.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.911
I've defended a lot of people
in this town,

15:16.979 --> 15:18.846
a lot of people with serious
resources and manpower.

15:18.914 --> 15:20.214
Yes, and the kidnappers
know that,

15:20.282 --> 15:22.316
and that's probably why
they picked this location.

15:22.384 --> 15:23.985
Why are we
even talking about this?

15:24.052 --> 15:25.519
If there's no way
to get in --

15:25.587 --> 15:27.822
if we can get in
unseen by water

15:27.889 --> 15:30.658
and get out quietly,
we should be fine.

15:30.726 --> 15:32.526
How do you propose
to do that?

15:32.594 --> 15:34.795
I need you to call one
of your drug-cartel clients

15:34.863 --> 15:37.098
and ask to borrow one of
their submersible vehicles

15:37.165 --> 15:38.466
they use
to bring in cocaine.

15:41.370 --> 15:43.738
Just because I work with people
who are <i>accused</i> --
Mr. Scott.

15:43.805 --> 15:46.440
Mr. Scott, you're not in front
of a camera right now.

15:46.508 --> 15:48.576
This isn't the time
for the lawyer act.

15:48.644 --> 15:51.846
You know what your clients do.
So do I.

15:51.913 --> 15:54.148
Get a submersible vehicle.
Do it now.

15:57.619 --> 15:59.520
Your daughter's life
is at stake.

16:06.461 --> 16:07.895
Oh, nice!

16:07.963 --> 16:10.698
Looks like we're pulling out
all the stops on this one.

16:10.766 --> 16:12.333
Hey,
I'm up for anything

16:12.401 --> 16:15.169
that involves borrowing
from drug cartels.

16:15.237 --> 16:17.471
Hey, uh, do we need
to sign anything, or...

16:17.539 --> 16:19.774
So,
the keys are in it?

16:22.511 --> 16:24.645
Where's Michael?
Oh, he had a meeting.

16:24.713 --> 16:26.681
Don't tell me -- Vaughn.

16:26.748 --> 16:29.050
Wish I had a different answer
for you, but yeah.

16:31.420 --> 16:34.088
So how's our project coming?
You talk to Barrett again?

16:34.156 --> 16:35.289
He confirmed the meeting.

16:35.357 --> 16:36.824
We'll set up,
and grab him there.

16:36.892 --> 16:38.059
Good.

16:38.126 --> 16:39.360
Send in a team, and we can --
No.

16:39.428 --> 16:40.961
He'll be expecting that.

16:41.029 --> 16:43.164
We need to keep this
low-profile --

16:43.231 --> 16:44.699
my operation, my way.

16:44.766 --> 16:46.133
No, <i>our</i> operation,
Michael.

16:46.201 --> 16:47.668
I've been supporting you
for a month on this thing.

16:47.736 --> 16:50.237
I was the one who gave you
the man's number, remember?

16:50.305 --> 16:52.206
Barrett is very, <i>very</i> good
at what he does.

16:52.274 --> 16:54.442
If you bring in a team,
he'll know it's there.

16:54.509 --> 16:56.310
He'll be prepared,
and you'll just get me killed.

16:56.378 --> 16:57.745
All right, fine.

16:57.813 --> 17:00.247
The last thing you said
you'd handle was Jesse Porter.

17:00.315 --> 17:02.850
So why was it my people tracked
him to a motel in Hialeah,

17:02.918 --> 17:04.117
staying under a fake name?

17:04.185 --> 17:05.419
You found Jesse?

17:05.487 --> 17:08.321
Give me his location.
Give me a day to handle it.

17:08.390 --> 17:09.390
We need him.

17:13.595 --> 17:14.929
Here you go.

17:16.865 --> 17:17.765
I hope you succeed.

17:18.834 --> 17:20.134
For Jesse's sake.

17:27.876 --> 17:29.977
Vaughn found Jesse.

17:30.045 --> 17:32.213
He's at a hotel.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.647
I have the address.

17:33.715 --> 17:35.449
I need to get over there,
try to talk to him.

17:35.517 --> 17:36.417
Michael.

17:36.485 --> 17:37.585
What?

17:37.652 --> 17:39.086
I need to talk to you
about something.

17:40.622 --> 17:44.358
On our last job, Jesse and I
were doing some surveillance.

17:44.426 --> 17:46.327
We were
about to get I.D.'d,

17:46.395 --> 17:48.696
and so,
to cover ourselves...

17:51.800 --> 17:53.467
...We kissed.

17:53.535 --> 17:55.369
You kissed?

17:55.437 --> 17:56.904
Well,
it was for the job.

17:56.972 --> 17:57.972
But, uh...

17:58.039 --> 18:01.041
I get it, Fi.
It's okay.

18:01.109 --> 18:02.877
Well,
you know how it is.

18:02.944 --> 18:05.446
When you work so closely
with someone,

18:05.514 --> 18:07.014
things get...Confusing.

18:07.082 --> 18:08.416
Are you confused now?

18:08.483 --> 18:10.184
No.

18:10.252 --> 18:11.419
I don't think so.

18:11.486 --> 18:12.653
I care about him.

18:12.721 --> 18:15.156
Maybe not in the way
that he would have wanted,

18:15.223 --> 18:17.324
but enough for him
to hurt us both.

18:19.928 --> 18:22.696
When he found out
that we lied to him,

18:22.764 --> 18:26.901
he was mad at you, but I think
my part in it cut even deeper.

18:26.968 --> 18:28.669
So what now?

18:28.737 --> 18:31.572
Well, I should be the one
to talk to him first.

18:31.640 --> 18:34.408
I owe him an apology.

18:34.476 --> 18:36.010
Maybe
I'll get through to him.

18:36.077 --> 18:37.912
Maybe you'll
get yourself killed.

18:37.979 --> 18:39.346
Well,
I'll bring your mom.

18:39.414 --> 18:42.716
Jesse might shoot me, but
there's no way he'd take her on.

18:47.489 --> 18:49.557
Now go save that girl,
Michael.

19:06.508 --> 19:09.577
<i>Defending a position is about</i>
<i>allocating resources --</i>

19:09.644 --> 19:12.480
<i>figuring out the most likely</i>
<i>source of an attack</i>

19:12.547 --> 19:14.582
<i>and putting the most firepower</i>
<i>there.</i>

19:18.053 --> 19:21.121
<i>Which means that less likely</i>
<i>avenues of attack</i>

19:21.189 --> 19:23.357
<i>won't be as well guarded.</i>

19:23.425 --> 19:25.426
<i>It worked for Hannibal</i>
<i>coming over the Alps to Italy</i>

19:25.494 --> 19:26.794
<i>and for Lawrence of Arabia</i>

19:26.862 --> 19:28.762
<i>coming over the Nefud Desert</i>
<i>to Aqaba.</i>

19:28.830 --> 19:31.098
<i>It's a technique</i>
<i>that depends on surprise,</i>

19:31.166 --> 19:33.434
<i>which means the only way</i>
<i>it can go wrong</i>

19:33.502 --> 19:36.303
<i>is if the bad guys</i>
<i>somehow know you're coming.</i>

19:36.371 --> 19:37.505
Don't move!

19:37.572 --> 19:39.373
Drop the weapon!

19:39.441 --> 19:40.875
Guys, easy.
Calm down.

19:40.942 --> 19:42.877
Calm down.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:42.944 --> 19:45.446
Well, well,
look who's here --

19:45.514 --> 19:47.681
the miracle worker.

19:50.352 --> 19:51.519
Let's just talk
about this.

19:52.954 --> 19:55.122
That Scott's a slippery
son of a bitch, isn't he?

19:55.190 --> 19:57.157
I figured
he might try something,

19:57.225 --> 20:00.394
so I tapped the ex-wife's phone,
just in case.

20:00.462 --> 20:03.364
Figured she might
get some news I might need.

20:03.431 --> 20:05.599
Sure enough,
he gives her a call,

20:05.667 --> 20:09.136
says some guy's coming over
to get the girl in a submarine.

20:10.505 --> 20:13.407
I mean, I didn't believe it,
but here you are.

20:15.143 --> 20:17.411
<i>I want to go home.</i>

20:17.479 --> 20:20.047
You take that back to Scott and
tell him if he wants his girl,

20:20.115 --> 20:21.415
get my brother
out of jail.

20:21.483 --> 20:23.617
That's the only way
this thing's gonna work.

20:23.685 --> 20:25.119
You want to know
how this thing works?

20:25.186 --> 20:26.520
I'll tell you
how this thing works.

20:26.588 --> 20:28.022
It's too late
for a not-guilty verdict.

20:28.089 --> 20:29.557
It's just not gonna happen.

20:29.624 --> 20:31.792
But if all you want
is your brother back,

20:31.860 --> 20:33.093
that I <i>can</i> do.

20:33.161 --> 20:34.762
You just said
he wasn't getting out of jail.

20:34.829 --> 20:38.332
No, I just said, "not guilty's
not gonna happen."

20:38.400 --> 20:41.035
But there are other ways
of keeping him out of prison.

20:41.102 --> 20:43.270
Hey, I found you,
didn't I?

20:43.338 --> 20:45.806
If I can do that, I can get your brother back.
You're serious.

20:45.874 --> 20:47.408
Like I said,
I'm a miracle worker.

20:47.475 --> 20:49.810
Okay.

20:49.878 --> 20:52.079
Show me a miracle.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.667
What do you mean, it didn't work?

20:55.679 --> 20:57.213
<i>You</i> said you could get her!
You said --

20:57.281 --> 20:58.881
I said
I needed you to make sure

20:58.949 --> 21:01.117
that you didn't
tell anybody about the plan!

21:01.185 --> 21:03.486
And you talked
to your ex-wife --

21:03.554 --> 21:06.155
a move that almost got
me <i>and</i> your daughter killed!

21:11.628 --> 21:13.963
I mean, I-I didn't know
what else to do.

21:14.031 --> 21:15.832
I know you're not
used to taking orders,

21:15.899 --> 21:17.800
but from now on,
you do exactly as we say.

21:17.868 --> 21:18.968
You understand?

21:19.036 --> 21:20.403
What now?

21:20.470 --> 21:22.471
At this point, the only way
we're gonna get Becky

21:22.539 --> 21:24.073
is to trade her
for Dale's brother.

21:24.141 --> 21:26.108
Oh, you mean
get him out of jail?

21:26.176 --> 21:28.244
No. I'm not gonna let a murderer
use a little girl

21:28.312 --> 21:29.345
to get out
of doing time.

21:29.413 --> 21:30.646
Then how?

21:30.714 --> 21:32.114
We make Dale think
that his brother's free

21:32.182 --> 21:33.583
just long enough
to get your daughter back.

21:33.650 --> 21:34.884
It's not gonna be easy,

21:34.952 --> 21:36.085
but we don't have a lot of cards
to play here.

21:36.153 --> 21:37.453
We got one shot --

21:37.521 --> 21:39.355
tomorrow afternoon,
when Rod is being transported

21:39.423 --> 21:41.157
from the County Jail
to the Courthouse.

21:41.225 --> 21:42.959
Okay.

21:43.026 --> 21:43.893
What can I do?

21:43.961 --> 21:45.094
We've got a plan,

21:45.162 --> 21:46.829
but it's gonna
take some money.

21:46.897 --> 21:48.097
Whatever you need.
It's yours.

21:48.165 --> 21:49.498
Plus,
we need some manpower,

21:49.566 --> 21:51.000
so you got to call
your little criminal friends,

21:51.068 --> 21:52.835
have them send over a guy
who can handle himself

21:52.903 --> 21:53.836
'cause it's gonna
get bumpy.

22:06.884 --> 22:08.918
You smoked an entire pack
in an hour.

22:08.986 --> 22:11.220
You have any idea
how bad that is for you?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.022
It's probably
better for my health

22:13.090 --> 22:15.691
than waiting around for
some burned spy with a grudge.

22:15.759 --> 22:17.960
You think Jesse
will ever show?

22:18.028 --> 22:20.029
I don't know.
Maybe we should come back later.

22:20.097 --> 22:22.098
You want to tell me
what you two are doing here?

22:22.165 --> 22:23.432
We need to talk.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.567
Really?

22:24.635 --> 22:25.835
Yeah, I'm, uh,
not too interested

22:25.903 --> 22:27.270
in having a conversation
right now.

22:27.337 --> 22:30.139
Just hear her out,
all right, Jesse?

22:30.207 --> 22:32.275
I've been baking in the sun
for an hour.

22:32.342 --> 22:34.110
I'm tired,
I'm out of cigarettes,

22:34.177 --> 22:36.078
and I'm not gonna be
hauling my ass all over Miami

22:36.146 --> 22:37.680
looking for you anymore.

22:39.249 --> 22:42.385
If you don't like
what she has to say,

22:42.452 --> 22:44.854
then, I don't know,
shoot her.

22:44.922 --> 22:46.289
Shoot both of us.

22:46.356 --> 22:48.524
All right.
That sounds fair enough.

22:48.592 --> 22:49.592
What do you want?

22:51.228 --> 22:54.497
Well, getting you burned
was an accident.

22:54.564 --> 22:56.332
Michael was looking
for information.

22:56.400 --> 22:57.934
We didn't know
it would hurt you.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.502
We lied to protect you.

22:59.569 --> 23:02.004
Maybe that was wrong, but we
did it for the right reasons.

23:02.072 --> 23:05.007
Is that what this is about?
You're here to make excuses?

23:05.075 --> 23:08.311
No, I'm here because
we're still going after Barrett.

23:08.378 --> 23:10.146
I'm here because
we need your help.

23:11.114 --> 23:12.682
I know you're angry.

23:12.749 --> 23:14.583
The fact is,
it wasn't all lies.

23:14.651 --> 23:15.751
We are your friends.

23:15.819 --> 23:18.120
Then and now.
You're my friends?

23:18.188 --> 23:19.555
Are you ser--

23:19.623 --> 23:20.890
you ruined my life.

23:20.958 --> 23:22.425
Jesse.
You understand that?

23:22.492 --> 23:24.026
I didn't know who the hell you people were!
Jesse.

23:24.094 --> 23:25.328
I trusted you!
Jesse!

23:25.395 --> 23:27.363
When I met Michael,
he was under a cover I.D.

23:27.431 --> 23:30.266
I fell in love with a man whose
real name I didn't even know.

23:30.334 --> 23:32.635
Sam informed on Michael
to the FBI,

23:32.703 --> 23:34.737
and we've all forgiven
each other.

23:36.106 --> 23:39.108
That's all really touching, Fi.
I'm not like you guys.

23:39.176 --> 23:41.077
You want to help Michael?

23:41.144 --> 23:43.546
You tell him
to watch his back.

23:43.613 --> 23:45.448
Look, if you
change your mind,

23:45.515 --> 23:47.383
he'll be at the Shoreline Diner
at 8:00.

23:47.451 --> 23:48.718
He just
wants to talk to you.

23:48.785 --> 23:51.821
Jesse,
for what it's worth...

23:51.888 --> 23:52.822
I'm sorry.

23:58.962 --> 24:01.664
Michael may not
be perfect, Jesse,

24:01.732 --> 24:03.632
but he's not the man
you're saying he is.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.434
Yeah, maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

24:05.502 --> 24:06.702
I know him plenty well!

24:08.305 --> 24:10.706
You're better than this,
Jesse.

24:10.774 --> 24:12.408
This is beneath you.

24:12.476 --> 24:14.610
Maybe you don't know <i>me</i>
<i>as well as you think you do.</i>

24:14.678 --> 24:16.078
Maybe not.

24:16.146 --> 24:19.949
But if you're gonna
kill my son...

24:20.017 --> 24:22.485
Just do me a favor
and wait a couple of days.

24:22.552 --> 24:24.954
'Cause he's trying to save
a little girl's life.

24:43.073 --> 24:44.173
I'm Vic.

24:44.241 --> 24:46.442
Mr. Scott sent me.

24:46.510 --> 24:48.110
He say what you were gonna be doing?
Kinda.

24:48.178 --> 24:49.412
I'm gonna be
driving the van,

24:49.479 --> 24:50.679
wearing
a prison-guard uniform.

24:50.747 --> 24:52.181
He said
it might get kinda rough.

24:52.249 --> 24:53.749
You're in
the ballpark.

24:53.817 --> 24:56.152
Here you go, sport.
Try those on.

24:56.219 --> 24:58.054
You can change
in the back there.

24:58.121 --> 24:59.522
Not to state the obvious,
Mike,

24:59.589 --> 25:01.057
but if Jesse was here,

25:01.091 --> 25:02.691
we wouldn't have to work with
a guy with a neck tattoo.

25:02.759 --> 25:04.326
Point taken, Sam.

25:04.394 --> 25:07.863
<i>Contracting requirements mean</i>

25:07.931 --> 25:10.966
<i>specs for most government</i>
<i>vehicles are easily available.</i>

25:11.034 --> 25:14.236
<i>If you want to build a prison</i>
<i>transport van, for example,</i>

25:14.304 --> 25:16.672
<i>you can get most of what</i>
<i>you need from public websites.</i>

25:16.740 --> 25:18.507
<i>Add the paint scheme and logos</i>

25:18.575 --> 25:20.142
<i>of your local</i>
<i>municipal government,</i>

25:20.210 --> 25:21.177
<i>and you're in business.</i>

25:23.313 --> 25:25.915
Well, we got
a nice fake prison van,

25:25.982 --> 25:27.650
nice fake prison guard.

25:27.717 --> 25:29.552
Now we just need
a fake prisoner.

25:29.619 --> 25:31.887
Fiona's working on it.

25:50.607 --> 25:52.741
What the hell?!

25:54.911 --> 25:57.413
Where'd you learn to drive?
Look at this!

25:57.481 --> 25:59.381
Remember me?

25:59.449 --> 26:00.282
Oh.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.518
Get in the trunk.

26:05.922 --> 26:08.424
You know, not a bad resemblance
to Rod Lawson.

26:08.492 --> 26:10.659
You could trim his eyebrows
a little bit

26:10.727 --> 26:12.161
just to complete
the illusion.

26:12.229 --> 26:13.629
I mean, we are trying
to fool his brother, after all.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.598
Well, there's no time
for plastic surgery

26:15.665 --> 26:17.032
to make him look perfect,

26:17.100 --> 26:19.935
so we're gonna have to settle
for bloodying you up a bit.

26:21.438 --> 26:25.107
Now, I wanted to cut you.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.844
But the big softy
right here,

26:28.912 --> 26:31.847
he convinced me that the
fake stuff would stick better.

26:31.915 --> 26:34.383
Ooh, watch t eyes, Rudy.

26:34.451 --> 26:35.818
It'll sting.

26:37.254 --> 26:38.821
But the sedative
will help.

26:38.889 --> 26:41.891
Ready? It's time.
I'm meeting Dale in an hour.

26:41.958 --> 26:44.260
Yep, we're ready.
How about you, big guy?

26:44.327 --> 26:45.794
Hmm? You ready?

26:45.862 --> 26:47.796
There we go.
Come on, now.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.771
That's your brother?

26:55.839 --> 26:57.506
Yeah, that's him.

26:57.574 --> 27:00.976
So how are you gonna do this,
anyway?

27:01.044 --> 27:02.077
That's <i>my</i> problem.

27:02.145 --> 27:03.279
No, no, no.

27:03.346 --> 27:06.081
My brother,
my problem, too, okay?

27:06.149 --> 27:07.883
Listen --
we got the route.

27:07.951 --> 27:10.019
We hit the van
at an intersection

27:10.086 --> 27:11.921
on the way
to the Courthouse.

27:11.988 --> 27:15.624
We sit back, we watch,
we make sure it goes smoothly.

27:15.692 --> 27:17.893
Before we do, though --
yeah, yeah, I got the girl.

27:17.961 --> 27:20.095
At the rendezvous point, because
if you try to pull anything --

27:20.163 --> 27:21.330
she'll be there.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.150
Courthouse is only
a couple miles away, you know.

27:41.218 --> 27:42.918
We can't do this just anywhere,
all right?

27:42.986 --> 27:43.919
It's under control.

27:47.490 --> 27:51.393
<i>Fire Engines and Ambulances</i>
<i>use traffic-control devices</i>

27:51.461 --> 27:52.895
<i>to make traffic</i>
<i>flow their way.</i>

27:52.963 --> 27:54.163
<i>They're fairly simple --</i>

27:54.231 --> 27:55.931
<i>strobing</i>
<i>at a particular frequency</i>

27:55.999 --> 27:57.800
<i>that can be picked up</i>
<i>by the traffic light.</i>

27:57.867 --> 28:00.803
<i>It's very illegal to use</i>
<i>if you're a private citizen,</i>

28:00.870 --> 28:03.472
<i>but remarkably useful if you</i>
<i>need to turn a red light green</i>

28:03.540 --> 28:06.742
<i>or, with a little rewiring,</i>
<i>turn a green light red.</i>

28:12.315 --> 28:15.484
There's a low-traffic street
up here. Good access roads.

28:15.552 --> 28:17.620
We can get away before the cops
know what happened, all right?

28:23.426 --> 28:26.328
All right. Just make sure
nothing goes wrong.

28:31.601 --> 28:32.901
It'll be fine.

28:32.969 --> 28:34.803
We'll stay back here
and watch the whole thing.

28:34.871 --> 28:38.707
<i>Spies and magicians use</i>
<i>many of the same techniques.</i>

28:38.775 --> 28:40.509
<i>They both know people</i>
<i>trust their eyes</i>

28:40.577 --> 28:41.910
<i>more than they should.</i>

28:41.978 --> 28:43.879
<i>If they think they know</i>
<i>what they're looking at,</i>

28:43.947 --> 28:45.347
<i>they don't look too closely.</i>

28:45.415 --> 28:46.849
<i>A group can help</i>
<i>sell the illusion.</i>

28:46.916 --> 28:48.651
<i>A few flashily dressed</i>
<i>assistants</i>

28:48.718 --> 28:51.120
<i>can draw the audience's eye</i>
<i>where you want it to go.</i>

28:51.187 --> 28:52.621
<i>And, of course,</i>

28:52.689 --> 28:55.357
<i>a well-timed cloud of fire</i>
<i>and smoke doesn't hurt.</i>

29:04.134 --> 29:05.234
Ohh!

29:10.907 --> 29:12.274
Get out of there!

29:12.342 --> 29:13.909
Let's go!
Face the van!

29:13.977 --> 29:15.010
Spread 'em!

29:15.078 --> 29:17.279
Open it up!

29:17.347 --> 29:18.547
Come on!

29:22.385 --> 29:25.554
On your face!
Hands behind your neck!

29:25.622 --> 29:26.889
Go!

29:28.758 --> 29:30.025
He better not be hurt.

29:30.093 --> 29:32.328
He'll be banged up a little bit,
but he'll heal.

29:36.299 --> 29:37.733
Gotta go.

29:56.399 --> 29:59.868
<i>Whether it's with imprisoned</i>
<i>spies, captured soldiers,</i>

29:59.936 --> 30:01.269
<i>or kidnapping victims,</i>

30:01.337 --> 30:03.739
<i>a hostage exchange</i>
<i>is always a touchy time.</i>

30:03.806 --> 30:06.008
<i>Tempers run hot,</i>
<i>and people are nervous</i>

30:06.075 --> 30:08.010
<i>about being tricked</i>
<i>or ripped off.</i>

30:08.077 --> 30:10.979
<i>If you happen to be planning</i>
<i>on tricking someone,</i>

30:11.047 --> 30:13.482
<i>you have all the more reason</i>
<i>to be careful.</i>

30:13.549 --> 30:14.850
Where's Becky?

30:14.917 --> 30:16.685
I told you nothing happens
till I see the girl.

30:16.753 --> 30:18.920
She's here.
Don't worry.

30:18.988 --> 30:20.989
All right,
bring her on in.

30:38.207 --> 30:39.274
There you go.

30:39.342 --> 30:41.109
Let me see
my brother now!

30:41.177 --> 30:42.611
He's in the back.

30:42.679 --> 30:44.413
You're gonna have to
cut his shackles

30:44.480 --> 30:46.748
and have a doctor see to his
head before he's walking around.

30:48.951 --> 30:51.420
You can take the keys.
Check your brother.

30:51.487 --> 30:53.955
You can keep the car. Ditch it
or burn it when you're done.

30:54.023 --> 30:55.223
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:57.026 --> 30:59.494
I'm gonna take you
to your mom.

31:04.801 --> 31:07.069
Do you like fireworks?
Yeah?

31:07.136 --> 31:09.371
Close your eyes.
Keep them closed. Close 'em.

31:09.439 --> 31:11.173
'Cause they're gonna get
real loud.

31:13.609 --> 31:15.610
Son of a bitch!
It's not him!

31:40.002 --> 31:42.771
You think
you can do this to me?!

31:42.839 --> 31:43.739
God!

31:52.215 --> 31:54.149
I, uh...

31:54.217 --> 31:58.386
I don't know
what to say, Mr. Westen.

31:58.454 --> 32:00.021
Thank you.

32:00.089 --> 32:01.656
Mr. Scott,
this isn't over.

32:01.724 --> 32:03.592
Dale Lawson may not know
who <i>I</i> am,

32:03.659 --> 32:04.960
but he still knows
who <i>you</i> are.

32:05.027 --> 32:06.595
And he's a little angry.

32:06.662 --> 32:07.662
Oh, yeah?

32:07.730 --> 32:09.564
Well...

32:09.632 --> 32:11.233
I'm angry, too.

32:11.300 --> 32:13.034
Hey. Listen to me --

32:13.102 --> 32:15.137
you need to find someplace safe
for your daughter.

32:15.204 --> 32:16.438
You need --

32:16.506 --> 32:18.607
Becky's booked on a flight
out of the country.

32:18.674 --> 32:21.042
I've made arrangements.
She'll be with her mother.

32:21.110 --> 32:25.547
Dale Lawson will never
be a threat to her again.

32:25.615 --> 32:27.616
Not just for her.
You need --

32:27.683 --> 32:31.253
thank you for your concern,
Mr. Westen,

32:31.320 --> 32:33.455
but, uh, I can
take care of myself.

32:33.523 --> 32:35.390
I-I don't want
to be rude,

32:35.458 --> 32:38.260
but, uh, I got some things
to take care of.

32:38.327 --> 32:40.662
If we can just handle
your payment.

32:40.730 --> 32:41.963
What do I owe you?

32:42.031 --> 32:44.666
I'll just hang on to
the submersible vehicle.

32:44.734 --> 32:46.101
It'll be my payment.

32:46.169 --> 32:47.969
I assume you can
take care of that.

32:48.037 --> 32:50.839
Of course. But what do you
want with it?

32:50.907 --> 32:52.240
That's my business.

33:05.288 --> 33:07.889
Has Jesse shown up yet?
No.

33:07.957 --> 33:10.358
Michael,
maybe you should just go.

33:10.426 --> 33:12.627
I figured there was a good
chance he wouldn't show.

33:12.695 --> 33:14.029
It looks like --
I'll wait.

33:14.096 --> 33:17.499
It's our last chance
before we go after Barrett.

33:17.567 --> 33:18.700
I don't want to blow it

33:18.768 --> 33:20.735
just because Jesse's
stuck in traffic.

33:20.803 --> 33:22.370
I know, but, Michael -- he's here.
I'll call you later.

33:25.842 --> 33:27.042
Sorry I'm late.

33:27.109 --> 33:28.577
I was sitting in my car
for the last 10 minutes

33:28.644 --> 33:30.212
with your head
in the cross hairs of a rifle...

33:32.315 --> 33:34.416
...Wondering if I should shoot
the man who ruined my life.

33:34.483 --> 33:35.684
And?

33:38.454 --> 33:40.088
Still thinking.

33:42.625 --> 33:43.859
Jesse,
I'd say I'm sorry,

33:43.926 --> 33:46.094
but I can tell you're in no mood
for apologies,

33:46.162 --> 33:47.629
so I'll get
right to the point.

33:47.697 --> 33:48.897
We're going after Barrett.

33:48.965 --> 33:52.534
The meeting is set.

33:52.602 --> 33:53.969
I need you
back on the team.

33:54.036 --> 33:56.438
Really?
Why would I do that?

33:56.505 --> 33:58.073
If we can
take Barrett down,

33:58.140 --> 34:00.642
maybe we can
get you back into --

34:05.982 --> 34:07.015
that's good.

34:11.219 --> 34:14.222
You know, I'm not a guy
that trusts very easily.

34:14.290 --> 34:17.893
I've...Never had
a lot of friends.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.860
Not close ones, anyway.

34:19.929 --> 34:22.397
I know it's hard to believe,
but I am your friend.

34:22.465 --> 34:23.665
And I've always been.

34:23.733 --> 34:28.969
I'm here because this is
your investigation, too.

34:29.038 --> 34:31.940
Barrett's gonna expect you
at the meeting.

34:33.842 --> 34:34.976
I <i>need</i> you there.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.578
Why? So I can
watch your back?

34:36.646 --> 34:39.414
This isn't just about me.

34:39.482 --> 34:41.449
You know Barrett
better than anyone.

34:41.516 --> 34:43.251
No, do <i>not</i> throw that
back in my face!

34:43.319 --> 34:46.154
This was my investigation --
<i>mine</i> --

34:46.222 --> 34:47.922
a long time
before you got involved,

34:47.989 --> 34:49.591
so you don't get to
use that against me.

34:49.659 --> 34:50.891
You understand me?

34:54.263 --> 34:57.198
Now, you want to have your meeting with
Barrett, that's fine.

34:57.266 --> 34:59.167
You do what you got to do.

34:59.235 --> 35:02.003
But as far as
me and you go...

35:02.071 --> 35:03.438
I make no promises.

35:12.014 --> 35:13.548
So? How'd it go?

35:13.616 --> 35:14.849
Could've been better.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.117
What does that mean?

35:16.185 --> 35:18.019
He's not gonna shoot me.
Yet.

35:18.087 --> 35:19.955
Well, that's good.
It's positive.

35:20.022 --> 35:21.389
I like that.

35:21.457 --> 35:23.591
As far as the Barrett meeting
is going, I'm on my own.

35:23.659 --> 35:24.893
Okay, well,
that's not so good.

35:24.961 --> 35:26.161
Mike, seriously.

35:26.228 --> 35:27.896
There is no way
we can pull this off --

35:27.964 --> 35:30.298
it is <i>not</i> something that
he's open to discussing.

35:30.366 --> 35:32.067
Okay.

35:32.134 --> 35:34.069
Let's look
at the situation here.

35:34.136 --> 35:35.503
You meet with Barrett here.

35:35.571 --> 35:37.372
Fi and I are gonna set up
over here by the bridge.

35:37.440 --> 35:39.174
The sub is there.
So you do your thing.

35:39.241 --> 35:40.942
You get Barrett into
the cargo hold, take off.

35:41.010 --> 35:42.310
But when this goes down,

35:42.378 --> 35:44.145
Fi and I are gonna
block the bridge, you know,

35:44.213 --> 35:45.580
with explosives
and whatnot,

35:45.648 --> 35:47.649
to make sure Barrett's team
doesn't come back in.

35:47.717 --> 35:50.118
But that still leaves you alone
with Barrett

35:50.186 --> 35:51.386
plus two guys.

35:51.454 --> 35:53.588
I got surprise
on my side.

35:53.656 --> 35:55.824
This is John Barrett
we're talking about.

35:55.891 --> 35:58.493
He's been dealing death
for the last decade.

35:58.561 --> 35:59.627
He's not
gonna bring --

35:59.695 --> 36:00.996
it's not ideal.

36:01.063 --> 36:03.264
But it's either that
or we give up and go home.

36:05.901 --> 36:07.302
Well, I guess
we roll the dice.

36:13.009 --> 36:14.642
<i>Any plan to grab a person</i>

36:14.710 --> 36:18.013
<i>has to strike a balance</i>
<i>between resources and secrecy.</i>

36:18.080 --> 36:21.649
<i>The more resources you bring --</i>
<i>people, weapons, vehicles --</i>

36:21.717 --> 36:23.885
<i>the easier the extraction</i>
<i>will be.</i>

36:23.953 --> 36:25.286
<i>At the same time,</i>

36:25.354 --> 36:27.789
<i>the more resources</i>
<i>you have in the field,</i>

36:27.857 --> 36:30.025
<i>the higher</i>
<i>your risk of exposure.</i>

36:30.092 --> 36:32.494
<i>You can only bring as much</i>
<i>manpower and equipment</i>

36:32.561 --> 36:33.428
<i>as you can conceal.</i>

36:39.969 --> 36:42.137
Okay. This is it.
Here he is.

36:43.606 --> 36:46.107
<i>If the circumstances</i>
<i>don't allow for much cover,</i>

36:46.175 --> 36:48.543
<i>an extraction</i>
<i>can get very risky...</i>

36:48.611 --> 36:51.980
<i>And very, very lonely.</i>

37:06.327 --> 37:07.396
Well,
it's nice to finally

37:07.476 --> 37:09.110
meet you in person,
Mr. Westen.

37:09.178 --> 37:10.879
The feeling's mutual.
You brought the bible?

37:12.982 --> 37:14.516
All right.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.951
I'll play.

37:17.019 --> 37:19.020
What exactly do you want?

37:19.088 --> 37:21.189
I guess you could say
I'm looking for work.

37:21.257 --> 37:23.525
Things have been a little lean
since I got burned,

37:23.592 --> 37:24.559
and when I say "work,"

37:24.627 --> 37:26.261
I'm not talking about joining

37:26.328 --> 37:28.563
the "black t-shirt
and sunglasses" squad.

37:28.631 --> 37:30.598
No offense.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.033
Well,
once we have the bible,

37:32.101 --> 37:33.768
there'll be plenty
of work to be done.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.770
I could use
someone like you.

37:35.838 --> 37:37.772
Shall we
get this started?

37:45.781 --> 37:47.649
Looks like everything
is going according to plan.

37:47.717 --> 37:48.883
Are Barrett's men
behaving themselves?

37:52.054 --> 37:52.987
So far.

37:59.829 --> 38:02.664
So let's move on
to the second part of the deal.

38:02.732 --> 38:04.165
Tell me about the bible.

38:04.233 --> 38:06.067
Simon Escher's bible.

38:06.135 --> 38:07.902
Let's put it this way --

38:07.970 --> 38:11.072
the people that burned you,
that burned Simon?

38:11.140 --> 38:14.209
They have names,
jobs, lives.

38:14.276 --> 38:16.578
They're hidden
in all sorts of places --

38:16.645 --> 38:18.313
government,
private sector.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.148
And if you know
who they are,

38:20.216 --> 38:23.051
you can see
the possibilities.

38:23.119 --> 38:24.552
So that list is the key

38:24.620 --> 38:27.222
to destroying the people who burned me?
It is.

38:27.289 --> 38:30.091
Had a feeling you might be
interested in helping me

38:30.159 --> 38:31.526
to do just that.

38:31.594 --> 38:33.027
So Simon...

38:33.095 --> 38:35.363
Compiled the list as insurance
in case things went bad,

38:35.431 --> 38:37.799
encrypted with a book code
for security.

38:37.867 --> 38:39.501
And when things
fell to pieces,

38:39.568 --> 38:41.970
he needed someone powerful
enough to play this card.

38:42.037 --> 38:43.138
He needed me.

38:51.514 --> 38:52.914
Yeah?

38:52.982 --> 38:55.617
Where?

38:55.684 --> 38:56.818
How many?

38:56.886 --> 39:00.121
Right.
Well, handle it.

39:00.189 --> 39:03.191
Well, this is getting
more interesting.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.627
What angle are you working,
exactly?

39:05.694 --> 39:07.128
What are you
talking about?

39:07.196 --> 39:09.364
The team of men on the road
out there approaching my men.

39:09.431 --> 39:10.665
Yours, I assume?

39:10.733 --> 39:12.333
You thought you could
double-cross me?

39:22.378 --> 39:23.812
Fi, this is <i>not</i> good.

39:23.879 --> 39:25.246
I guess Michael's
little agreement

39:25.314 --> 39:26.548
that Vaughn
would steer clear

39:26.615 --> 39:27.682
wasn't quite as solid
as he thought.

39:30.619 --> 39:31.853
You and I are gonna have

39:31.921 --> 39:34.956
a private and very painful
conversation.

39:35.024 --> 39:37.826
And you're gonna tell me
<i>exactly</i> what is going on here.

39:37.893 --> 39:39.594
Take him!

39:42.464 --> 39:43.464
Oh, now they got Mike!

39:57.713 --> 39:59.614
<i>Shooting through a friendly</i>
<i>to hit a target</i>

39:59.682 --> 40:01.115
<i>is a tricky thing to pull off.</i>

40:01.183 --> 40:02.517
<i>There are only a few places</i>
<i>on the human body</i>

40:02.585 --> 40:04.185
<i>that can take a gunshot</i>

40:04.253 --> 40:08.423
<i>without severing a major artery</i>
<i>or destroying a vital organ.</i>

40:08.490 --> 40:10.758
He shot Michael!
What is Jesse doing?!

40:10.826 --> 40:12.093
No, he shot
the guy <i>behind</i> him.

40:12.161 --> 40:13.995
He's saving Mike's butt
is what he's doing.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.197
<i>Getting shot on the inside</i>
<i>of the shoulder</i>

40:16.265 --> 40:17.632
<i>won't kill you quickly,</i>

40:17.700 --> 40:19.434
<i>but almost any gunshot</i>
<i>will kill you</i>

40:19.501 --> 40:21.002
<i>if you give it enough time.</i>

40:40.422 --> 40:42.590
Who do you work for?!

40:42.658 --> 40:43.591
I'm self-employed.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.597
Oh, it hurts?!
Get used to it!

40:51.700 --> 40:53.001
By the time
I'm done with you,

40:53.068 --> 40:54.435
you're gonna wish
that bullet killed you!

40:55.938 --> 40:58.273
<i>There's a cold math</i>
<i>to blood loss.</i>

40:58.340 --> 41:01.042
<i>The more you lose,</i>
<i>the weaker you get.</i>

41:01.110 --> 41:04.178
<i>And when you're on a clock</i>
<i>like that, it pays to act,</i>

41:04.246 --> 41:06.547
<i>no matter how desperate</i>
<i>your plan might be.</i>

41:06.615 --> 41:09.651
<i>Because if you wait,</i>
<i>you may not have the chance.</i>
