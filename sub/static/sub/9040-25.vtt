WEBVTT

00:03.200 --> 00:05.567
- OH, HONEY,
YOU LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL.

00:05.567 --> 00:07.300
OKAY.

00:07.300 --> 00:08.567
SO YOU GO WAIT
OUT IN THE CAR,

00:08.567 --> 00:10.233
AND DADDY WILL
BE RIGHT OUT, ALL RIGHT?

00:10.233 --> 00:12.433
- BYE, MOMMY.
- BYE, SWEETIE.

00:12.433 --> 00:14.100
AWW.

00:14.100 --> 00:15.900
[chuckles]

00:15.900 --> 00:18.633
RAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:18.633 --> 00:20.733
- WHY CAN'T YOU
TAKE HER TO THIS THING?

00:20.733 --> 00:26.300
- [sighs] BECAUSE IT'S
A FATHER-DAUGHTER DANCE.

00:26.300 --> 00:28.567
- THINK THEY HAVE
A FATHER-DAUGHTER POKER NIGHT

00:28.567 --> 00:30.433
AT THE RACETRACK.

00:30.433 --> 00:32.000
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT
I WOULD LOVE?

00:32.000 --> 00:33.300
ASK ONE
OF THE OTHER FATHERS

00:33.300 --> 00:34.800
TO FILM YOU TWO DANCING.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.800
- [groans]
- FAST AND SLOW.

00:36.800 --> 00:37.967
- [groans]
- OKAY?

00:37.967 --> 00:39.967
AND STAY THE FULL
TWO HOURS.

00:39.967 --> 00:42.133
- [groans]
- HAVE A GOOD TIME.

00:42.133 --> 00:45.267
- THERE BETTER BE BOOZE
AT THIS THING.

00:49.867 --> 00:52.000
- WATCH ME, DADDY.

00:54.700 --> 00:56.867
- HEY, THAT'S GOOD.
WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT?

00:56.867 --> 00:59.300
- I DON'T KNOW.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.733
- WHAT ARE YOU,
LIKE, 21, 22 NOW?

01:01.733 --> 01:03.967
- I'M NINE.

01:03.967 --> 01:06.533
- OH, RIGHT, NINE.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.467
YEAH.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.567
[chuckles]

01:43.300 --> 01:45.000
- HELLO, RAYMOND.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.133
WANT TO MAKE A BABY?

02:04.200 --> 02:07.200
- AHH.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.100
- OH. MWAH. MWAH. MWAH.
MWAH. MWAH.

02:11.100 --> 02:14.600
- UH-HUH.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.333
DEB, DEB,
JUST W-WAIT A MINUTE.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.767
WAIT A MINUTE.
- WHAT?

02:17.767 --> 02:21.367
- WELL, WE'VE BEEN HAVING SEX
EVERY DAY

02:21.367 --> 02:24.667
FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS.

02:24.667 --> 02:28.000
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE A PIECE OF MEAT.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.533
- OKAY.

02:37.767 --> 02:40.300
- WHAT--UGH.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.700
BOY, YOU REALLY WANT
A KID, HUH?

02:42.700 --> 02:44.300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
DON'T YOU?

02:44.300 --> 02:46.267
- YEAH, I GUE--
- HUH?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.100
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:48.100 --> 02:49.667
- WELL, WHAT?

02:49.667 --> 02:52.600
I MEAN,
WASN'T THIS THE PLAN?

02:52.600 --> 02:54.267
WE'VE BEEN TRYING
FOR THREE MONTHS.

02:54.267 --> 02:55.667
AREN'T YOU THE ONE
THAT SAID YOU WANTED

02:55.667 --> 02:58.667
A LITTLE RAY OR RAYMONA?

03:02.900 --> 03:05.067
- YEAH.

03:05.067 --> 03:08.300
YEAH, I-I DON'T KNOW.

03:08.300 --> 03:11.000
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HAVE KIDS?

03:13.000 --> 03:15.333
- DOES IT HAVE
TO BE RIGHT THIS SECOND?

03:15.333 --> 03:19.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS NOW.

03:19.067 --> 03:20.867
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
RESPONSIBILITY.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.633
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.
YOU'RE A BABY.

03:23.633 --> 03:25.300
- YES, AND YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY

03:25.300 --> 03:28.267
ABOUT BABIES HAVING BABIES;
IT'S A CRISIS.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.200
- MY GOD.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.100
THIS IS ALL
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT FOR--

03:33.100 --> 03:34.833
FOR--FOR A YEAR.

03:34.833 --> 03:36.567
- WELL, I MEAN,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD

03:36.567 --> 03:38.567
DEVELOP
SOME OTHER INTERESTS.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.933
LOOK, WAIT, STOP, LOOK,
ALL I'M SAYING IS--

03:40.933 --> 03:43.233
IS YOU SHOULDN'T GET SO NUTTY
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT.

03:43.233 --> 03:44.667
- WELL,
WHY THE HELL NOT?

03:44.667 --> 03:46.333
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THE LANGUAGE,

03:46.333 --> 03:48.333
NOT REALLY FOR CHILDREN.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.433
LET'S JUST
LET IT HAPPEN, OKAY?

03:50.433 --> 03:51.633
IF IT HAPPENS,
THEN IT HAPPENS.

03:51.633 --> 03:53.267
- NO, NO, YOU HAVE
TO KEEP AT IT.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.367
THERE'S ONLY
SO MANY DAYS PER MONTH.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.733
- I'M JUST SAYING
THAT WE SHOULDN'T

03:56.733 --> 03:58.600
GET OUR HOPES UP, OKAY?

03:58.600 --> 04:00.933
IN CASE--

04:00.933 --> 04:04.133
YOU KNOW.

04:04.133 --> 04:07.267
WHATEVER.

04:10.933 --> 04:13.400
- RAY, YOU DO KNOW

04:13.400 --> 04:16.633
THAT THREE MONTHS OF TRYING
ISN'T THAT LONG, RIGHT?

04:16.633 --> 04:18.033
- HEY, DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I DON'T EVEN WANT

04:18.033 --> 04:20.333
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
- OH, SWEETIE.

04:20.333 --> 04:24.433
IT'S NORMAL, REALLY.

04:24.433 --> 04:28.100
- I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT THIS FEELING.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.733
- YEAH?
A FEELING?

04:30.733 --> 04:32.367
- THREE MONTHS,

04:32.367 --> 04:35.400
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD
A KID ALREADY.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.167
- NO, LISTEN, RAY,
I'M TELLING YOU.

04:39.167 --> 04:40.867
- LOOK, MY FATHER SAID
SOME STUFF, OKAY?

04:40.867 --> 04:44.033
US BARONES, WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE REALLY "VIREAL."

04:44.033 --> 04:46.533
I MEAN, I-I SHOULD HAVE--

04:46.533 --> 04:49.767
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO IMPREGNATE YOU BY NOW.

04:49.767 --> 04:51.000
- YOUR DAD SAID THAT?

04:51.000 --> 04:54.133
- HE SAID KNOCK YOU UP,
BUT YEAH.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.900
- RAY, LOOK, HONEY,

04:59.900 --> 05:04.600
MY GYNECOLOGIST SAID THAT
IT MIGHT TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS

05:04.600 --> 05:08.400
TO KNOCK ME UP.

05:08.400 --> 05:12.100
OH, HONEY, YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:12.100 --> 05:15.233
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:20.267 --> 05:21.433
- I GUESS
IF IT'S A GIRL,

05:21.433 --> 05:24.633
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE RAYMONA.

05:24.633 --> 05:27.967
I ALSO LIKE ALEXANDRA--

05:27.967 --> 05:29.167
ALLY.

05:29.167 --> 05:32.300
- YEAH.
I LIKE THAT.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.000
- MY FATHER'S AN IDIOT.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.233
- YEAH, YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I COULD USE

05:43.233 --> 05:46.367
LESS OF A FRANK IMAGE
RIGHT NOW.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.033
[buzzer]

05:52.733 --> 05:54.300
- OH, HI, MARIE.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.667
- HI, DEAR. HI.
- COME ON IN.

05:56.667 --> 05:57.567
RAY'S NOT EVEN HOME YET.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.233
FRANK AND ROBERT
STILL PARKING?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.033
- OH, FRANK'S LOOKING
FOR A BROKEN METER.

06:01.033 --> 06:05.233
IF ROBERT WASN'T WITH HIM,
HE'D BREAK ONE HIMSELF.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.300
I MADE YOU SOME APPETIZERS
FOR TONIGHT.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.800
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
DEAR.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.733
- OH, PLEASE, ANYTIME YOU WANT
TO COME OVER WITH FOOD,

06:10.733 --> 06:15.200
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME.
- OKAY. [laughs]

06:15.200 --> 06:17.767
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
- GOOD, AND YOU?

06:17.767 --> 06:19.300
- GOOD.

06:19.300 --> 06:22.400
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

06:22.400 --> 06:24.300
- NO, I'M NOT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

06:24.300 --> 06:30.433
- YES, I AM.
[both screaming]

06:35.800 --> 06:38.500
- OH, I AM SO HAPPY
FOR YOU.

06:38.500 --> 06:39.900
- OH, SO AM I.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.533
- WHEN DID YOU FIND OUT?
- TODAY!

06:41.533 --> 06:43.033
I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD RAY YET.

06:43.033 --> 06:44.867
- YOU HAVEN'T? OH, HOW EXCITING.
- YES!

06:44.867 --> 06:47.167
- OH, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE
SUCH A GOOD MOTHER.

06:47.167 --> 06:48.867
- OH, YOU'RE GOING TO BE
SUCH A GOOD GRANDMOTHER.

06:48.867 --> 06:53.833
- I KNOW.
[laughter]

06:53.833 --> 06:56.400
- HEY.
- HEY.

07:04.667 --> 07:06.933
SO YOU FOUND
A PARKING SPACE, FRANK?

07:06.933 --> 07:08.233
- [halting stutter]

07:08.233 --> 07:10.967
- I HATE
ALL THESE DAMN FIRE HYDRANTS.

07:10.967 --> 07:14.100
I'M GLAD
DOGS PEE ON THEM.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.800
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, FRANK.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.033
YEAH, DAMN FIRE HYDRANTS.

07:23.033 --> 07:25.300
[laughter]

07:25.300 --> 07:26.933
SO HOW ARE YOU DOING,
ROBERT?

07:26.933 --> 07:28.600
- ACTUALLY, I'M DOING GOOD.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.333
I MET A GIRL.
- OH, REALLY?

07:31.333 --> 07:33.567
WHAT'S HER NAME?
- JOANNE.

07:33.567 --> 07:37.033
OH, SHE'S GREAT.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.467
WE'VE ONLY BEEN OUT
ONE TIME,

07:38.467 --> 07:39.800
BUT I REALLY THINK
THAT THIS--

07:39.800 --> 07:42.433
- DEBRA'S PREGNANT!

07:42.433 --> 07:44.600
- IT'S TRUE!
IT'S TRUE!

07:44.600 --> 07:47.933
I JUST FOUND OUT.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.667
OH.

07:49.667 --> 07:53.800
- NOW I FEEL BAD GOING ON
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PARK.

07:53.800 --> 07:57.333
- UNCLE ROBERT,
NO, NO, NO, UNCLE BOBBY, YES.

07:57.333 --> 07:58.900
"HEY, UNCLE BOBBY,
WHAT'S UP?"

07:58.900 --> 08:00.200
"AW, NOTHING MUCH, KID.
I JUST--"

08:00.200 --> 08:01.633
OH, YEAH.

08:01.633 --> 08:03.867
- OKAY, SO LISTEN,
LISTEN, LISTEN.

08:03.867 --> 08:05.733
RAY DOESN'T KNOW YET,
SO WHEN HE GETS HOME,

08:05.733 --> 08:07.400
YOU HAVE TO LET ME--

08:07.400 --> 08:11.733
- RAYMOND!
MY BEAUTIFUL BOY.

08:11.733 --> 08:15.000
- HEY.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.300
- SO HOW WAS WORK?

08:16.300 --> 08:18.267
- OH, GOD, MY EDITOR
IS SUCH AN IDIOT.

08:18.267 --> 08:19.900
- OKAY, SO YOU HAD
A BAD DAY,

08:19.900 --> 08:21.767
BUT HOW
ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?

08:21.767 --> 08:24.467
I MEAN, YOUR FATHER'S FINE,
AND I'M FINE,

08:24.467 --> 08:28.233
AND ROBERT'S
THE SAME AS ALWAYS.

08:28.233 --> 08:32.533
BUT HOW--HOW WAS YOUR DAY,
DEBRA, HUH?

08:32.533 --> 08:35.000
- YEAH, IT--
IT WAS OKAY, MARIE.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.633
- YOU OKAY, MA?
- YES.

08:36.633 --> 08:40.000
- BUT THE QUESTION IS,
HOW IS DEBRA?

08:44.133 --> 08:46.200
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- NOTHING. WHAT?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.267
YOU KNOW WHAT, MARIE,
WHY DON'T YOU GO

08:47.267 --> 08:48.600
BREAK OUT YOUR APPETIZERS?

08:48.600 --> 08:50.433
- YEAH, MA, GO GET THOSE.
- OKAY, OKAY.

08:50.433 --> 08:52.733
BUT NOBODY TALK
UNTIL I GET BACK, ALL RIGHT?

08:52.733 --> 08:56.133
OH, IN FACT, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S A FUN GAME TO PLAY?

08:56.133 --> 08:58.567
SILENT INDIAN,
THE NO-TALKING GAME.

08:58.567 --> 09:01.400
PLAY THAT.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.000
- HEY, WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:04.000 --> 09:06.467
WHAT? DEBRA, WHAT?
WHAT THE HELL?

09:06.467 --> 09:09.233
- RAY, OUR FIRST
FEW YEARS TOGETHER

09:09.233 --> 09:11.267
HAVE BEEN A JOY TO ME--

09:11.267 --> 09:14.067
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING OUT--RAYMOND!

09:16.833 --> 09:19.033
- AND I THINK OF OUR--
OUR LIFE TOGETHER

09:19.033 --> 09:21.967
AS A JOURNEY--
- HEY!

09:21.967 --> 09:25.667
DON'T YOU WANT
YOUR APPETIZERS?

09:25.667 --> 09:28.667
- A GREAT JOURNEY,
AND ALONG THIS PATH--

09:28.667 --> 09:31.033
[pounding on door]

09:31.033 --> 09:32.700
- NO, MA, STOP!

09:32.700 --> 09:34.833
- ALONG THIS PATH,
WE WOULD SHARE

09:34.833 --> 09:36.800
MANY JOYFUL MOMENTS TOGETHER,

09:36.800 --> 09:38.967
MOMENTS
THAT WE WILL REMEMBER--

09:38.967 --> 09:41.600
OKAY!

09:41.600 --> 09:42.967
I'M PREGNANT!

09:42.967 --> 09:45.600
- WHAT?

09:45.600 --> 09:48.000
[pounding stops]

09:48.000 --> 09:50.067
- PREGNANT!
DEBRA'S PREGNANT!

09:50.067 --> 09:53.500
[laughing]

10:03.267 --> 10:05.400
- DEBRA, DEAR,
I MADE YOU SOME PASTA.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.233
- OH, NO, THANKS.
I'M NOT HUNGRY, MARIE.

10:07.233 --> 10:10.433
- HIT ME. I'M OPEN.

10:10.433 --> 10:12.067
- BUT YOUR BABY'S JUST
THREE WEEKS AWAY.

10:12.067 --> 10:13.267
YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH.

10:13.267 --> 10:14.567
- I KNOW, BUT I TOLD YOU
THE DOCTOR SAID

10:14.567 --> 10:16.500
I SHOULDN'T BE EATING
ANYTHING HEAVY.

10:16.500 --> 10:20.167
- SO YOU'RE JUST GOING TO DO
EVERYTHING THE DOCTOR SAYS?

10:20.167 --> 10:21.600
WHEN I WAS WITH CHILD,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.333
I ATE
THREE HEALTHY MEALS A DAY,

10:23.333 --> 10:25.700
AND LOOK
HOW MY BOYS TURNED OUT.

10:25.700 --> 10:28.467
- STOP EATING IMMEDIATELY.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.967
- WELL, I THOUGHT
SOME MOTHERLY WISDOM

10:31.967 --> 10:33.633
WOULD BE APPRECIATED,
BUT I GUESS I'M NOT WORTH--

10:33.633 --> 10:37.467
- OKAY, I'LL EAT IT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

10:37.467 --> 10:39.800
- NO TROUBLE, DEAR.
I'M GOING TO MAKE YOU SOME TEA.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.733
PREGNANT WOMEN LOVE TEA.

10:44.133 --> 10:48.267
- COME OUT!

11:04.000 --> 11:08.300
NO, NO, I GOT IT.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.800
- HUH? WHAT WAS THAT?
WHAT?

11:09.800 --> 11:11.300
- NOTHING.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.967
I'M GOING TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

11:12.967 --> 11:16.100
- OKAY. HURRY BACK,
MOMMYCAKES.

11:23.467 --> 11:26.300
- HEY, OKAY,
I GOT SOME BIG NEWS,

11:26.300 --> 11:28.267
AND I WANTED
TO TELL YOU GUYS FIRST.

11:28.267 --> 11:32.567
[deep breath]
ALL RIGHT.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.600
I'VE BEEN DATING JOANNE
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS NOW,

11:34.600 --> 11:37.600
AND I THINK THAT I JUST
MIGHT HAVE FOUND MY DEBRA.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.300
SO AFTER CAREFUL
DELIBERATION,

11:39.300 --> 11:41.267
I HAVE DECIDED THAT
I'M GOING TO ASK HER--

11:41.267 --> 11:42.433

11:57.133 --> 11:59.467
MY WATER JUST BROKE, RAY!

11:59.467 --> 12:01.733

- WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO?

12:14.167 --> 12:17.200
DON'T YOU HAVE TO GO
A-AWAY FROM HERE?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.533
- OH, NO,
I DON'T HAVE A ROUTE

12:18.533 --> 12:20.167
MAPPED OUT TO THE HOSPITAL
FROM HERE.

12:20.167 --> 12:22.400

I DON'T WANT MARIE TO KNOW.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.267
LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.
- WHAT--

12:24.267 --> 12:25.700
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO TELL MY MOTHER?

12:25.700 --> 12:27.367
- LOOK,
AFTER WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL

12:27.367 --> 12:29.267
AND WE'RE WELL UNDERWAY,
THEN YOU CAN TELL HER.

12:29.267 --> 12:30.300

12:30.300 --> 12:31.700
- KINDERGARTEN.
AAH.

12:31.700 --> 12:34.300
I DON'T WANT HER
IN MY DELIVERY ROOM.

12:34.300 --> 12:35.833
- MAYBE SHE COULD
JUST BRING COOKIES.

12:35.833 --> 12:39.633
- I AM GOING
TO BITE YOUR NOSE RIGHT OFF.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.600
- MAYBE YOU GIVE US
A HEAD START, OKAY?

12:41.600 --> 12:45.100
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

THINKING OF TAKING

12:50.467 --> 12:51.933
A LITTLE WALK. RIGHT, RAY?

A WALK AROUND THE BLOCK.

12:53.933 --> 12:55.633

TO COME WITH US?

12:57.067 --> 12:59.600
- I DON'T KNOW. DO I?

12:59.600 --> 13:01.200
- I JUST THOUGHT
THAT SINCE YOU'RE A COP,

13:01.200 --> 13:02.733
MAYBE WE COULD WALK
A LITTLE FASTER,

13:02.733 --> 13:05.200
LIKE, RIGHT THROUGH
THE RED LIGHTS...

13:05.200 --> 13:09.267
SINCE YOU'RE A COP.

13:09.267 --> 13:11.600
- OH, YEAH.
RIGHT.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.933
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
LET ME GET MY JACKET.

WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY?

13:23.033 --> 13:24.100
WHY DON'T YOU JUST STAY?

13:24.100 --> 13:25.967
- WELL,
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

13:25.967 --> 13:27.567
- BECAUSE--
BECAUSE, UH, UH--

13:27.567 --> 13:29.833
OH, HI, HONEY.
MWAH, YEAH.

13:32.667 --> 13:35.000

13:35.000 --> 13:37.967
YOU SHOULD STAY HERE.
- WHY, FRANK?

13:37.967 --> 13:41.333
- 'CAUSE...

13:41.333 --> 13:44.667
THEN YOU AND I
COULD HAVE SOME...

13:48.767 --> 13:52.867
ALONE TIME.

13:52.867 --> 13:55.000
- REALLY?

13:57.167 --> 13:59.600
OKAY, WELL,

13:59.600 --> 14:01.667
I GUESS WE'LL SEE YOU KIDS
IN A WHILE.

14:01.667 --> 14:04.600
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.500
- I HOPE EVERYBODY REMEMBERS
THIS MOMENT

14:06.500 --> 14:09.633
WHEN IT'S TIME
TO NAME THE BABY.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.133

14:13.133 --> 14:14.533

THIS IS THE L.I.E.
I SAID TO TAKE THE BRIDGE!

AN ACCIDENT UP AHEAD.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.433
- WELL, GO AROUND THEM.
JUST PUT YOUR SIREN ON.

14:37.433 --> 14:38.633
- THERE'S NO ROOM TO MOVE.

14:38.633 --> 14:41.333
A SIREN WOULD JUST
ANNOY PEOPLE.

14:41.333 --> 14:44.400
OH, MAYBE THE BRIDGE
WOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.800
- WOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER
TO PUT A STAMP

14:45.800 --> 14:47.000
ON HER BUTT AND MAIL HER.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.167

THOU SHALT NOT LOOK
AT THY BROTHER'S WIFE THERE.

16:18.567 --> 16:20.100

16:20.100 --> 16:21.667
- IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
A COMMANDMENT.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.933
IT'S SO BAD, GOD JUST FIGURED
THAT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD.

16:23.933 --> 16:26.767
