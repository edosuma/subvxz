WEBVTT

00:11.136 --> 00:12.638
Low to the body.

00:13.388 --> 00:17.642
There you go. Go low, set him up.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.897
That's all you got?

00:25.776 --> 00:27.611
What you got, huh? What you got?

00:27.819 --> 00:29.571
What you got?

00:29.738 --> 00:32.824
Hey, man, whoa.
Look, you gonna kill him.

00:36.495 --> 00:38.496
Hey, man, you okay?

00:42.542 --> 00:44.085
Luther Stubbs?

00:44.252 --> 00:45.962
Yeah, who wants to know?

00:46.129 --> 00:50.258
I'm a fan. I saw your bout in St. Louis
three years ago.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.510
Bloodiest fight I've ever seen.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.929
The other boxer didn't even make it
to the hospital.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.848
Died in the ring.

00:57.349 --> 01:00.560
Yeah, well, you know,
everybody gotta go sometime.

01:01.269 --> 01:05.272
I wanna know what it felt like to take
another life with your own hands.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.901
Guy didn't even cut me, man.
Now, move.

01:08.109 --> 01:11.029
- Not till I get what I came for.
- And what might that be?

01:12.155 --> 01:15.325
- Your killer instinct.
- Whoa, what...?

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.353 --> 01:46.939
And since it's time
for Quake's yearly inventory,

01:47.106 --> 01:48.941
I have to count everything
in the restaurant,

01:49.108 --> 01:51.277
down to the last swizzle stick.
It's gonna take days.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.696
Guess that's why you get paid
the medium-sized bucks.

01:53.863 --> 01:57.074
And which bucks
would those be, exactly?

01:58.117 --> 02:00.161
Okay. Okay, what's wrong
with this picture?

02:00.328 --> 02:02.330
Aside from me
not getting paid enough?

02:02.538 --> 02:05.291
No, what is Grams' statue
still doing in the living room?

02:05.458 --> 02:07.335
We talked about it last night,
remember?

02:07.501 --> 02:09.711
Yes, I do remember,
and I thought that we agreed

02:09.919 --> 02:12.131
that it was an eyesore
and was going back to storage.

02:12.298 --> 02:15.968
That is before I learned that storage
downtown is now 90 bucks a month

02:16.135 --> 02:17.678
and storage here is free.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.639
So I called Phoebe,
and we decided she could stay here.

02:20.848 --> 02:23.434
And last I checked,
we were still living in a democracy.

02:24.101 --> 02:26.312
Okay. But, Piper, she's ugly.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.940
Majority rules, sis,
unless you can move her.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.032
Okay. Okay, that didn't work.

02:38.198 --> 02:42.119
It's solid marble. It took eight of
Phoebe's bouncer friends to move it.

02:42.286 --> 02:43.787
It's too heavy for you.

02:43.996 --> 02:47.166
You know, my powers
are still growing, and one day...

02:47.332 --> 02:51.086
You can move it into the basement.
But until then, suffer.

02:53.005 --> 02:54.840
Phoebe.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.013
Phoebe?

03:04.016 --> 03:07.102
Hi. I was just...

03:07.269 --> 03:09.146
Opening up a can of whup-ass.

03:09.313 --> 03:12.190
Yeah, those are some serious moves.
Where did you learn that?

03:12.357 --> 03:15.319
Okay, I'm busted. I confess.

03:15.485 --> 03:18.989
I got tired of being the one in the family
with the passive power,

03:19.197 --> 03:20.949
so I started taking
self-defence classes,

03:21.116 --> 03:23.618
which I've been putting
on my new credit card.

03:23.785 --> 03:25.704
And this thing?

03:25.871 --> 03:29.875
Oh, that's Slam Man.
Got him off an infomercial.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.251
Great, another eyesore.

03:31.710 --> 03:35.297
It' a total and complete martial-arts
training system.

03:35.464 --> 03:37.549
And with their easy-instalment
payment plan...

03:37.757 --> 03:40.010
Which you also put on
your new credit card.

03:40.218 --> 03:42.637
He's gonna pay for himself
the first time I kick ass

03:42.846 --> 03:46.057
on some unsuspected gnarly beast.

03:46.224 --> 03:48.602
- Come on, wanna see some moves?
- No.

03:48.768 --> 03:51.396
Come on. Come on.

03:52.897 --> 03:54.816
You know, that is so unfair.

03:55.025 --> 03:58.028
Hey, demons do not play fair.

03:59.446 --> 04:02.032
- Gotcha.
- So, Daniel-san.

04:02.198 --> 04:04.617
Okay, okay. Uncle. Okay, okay.

04:04.826 --> 04:08.204
- I didn't hear you say it.
- Pheebs, let go.

04:15.545 --> 04:18.298
- Phoebe, what is it?
- What did you see?

04:21.009 --> 04:23.011
I saw you die.

06:06.071 --> 06:08.240
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:08.657 --> 06:10.200
We're gonna need a lot more of this.

06:10.367 --> 06:11.702
You couldn't sleep either, huh?

06:11.869 --> 06:13.620
No, I was up all night.

06:13.787 --> 06:17.374
I couldn't get that image of Prue
getting killed out of my head.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.960
- Is that the sword?
- Yeah. I drew it from memory.

06:20.168 --> 06:22.296
<i>I can't find it
in the Book of Shadows yet.</i>

06:22.504 --> 06:24.089
I wish that thing had an index.

06:24.256 --> 06:26.425
I wish you had a closer look
at the killer's face.

06:26.633 --> 06:29.011
Yeah, well, if somebody
tries to impale my sister,

06:29.177 --> 06:31.263
they're gonna have to
get through me.

06:31.471 --> 06:35.976
- Oh, good, coffee.
- Why are you dressed up?

06:36.184 --> 06:38.311
Because they don't have
casual day at Buckland's.

06:38.478 --> 06:41.857
Wait, you promised you would stay
home so we could figure this out.

06:42.023 --> 06:44.776
Yeah, and then Claire called,
and she has a client

06:44.943 --> 06:47.070
that wants to put a major collection
on the block.

06:47.237 --> 06:49.906
If we get this account, it would
be a serious coup for Buckland's.

06:50.323 --> 06:52.117
Can't Claire get somebody else
to do it?

06:52.284 --> 06:55.203
I've worked so hard to get Claire
to trust me with something like this.

06:55.370 --> 06:57.038
Why should someone else
get all the glory?

06:57.205 --> 07:01.334
I'll take "the nasty demon that wants
you dead" for a hundred, Bob.

07:01.751 --> 07:05.088
I can't believe you would risk your life
to impress your boss.

07:05.255 --> 07:06.840
You cannot leave the house.

07:07.549 --> 07:08.925
Okay, relax.

07:09.134 --> 07:12.637
Phoebe's had premonitions before,
and we've affected the outcome, right?

07:12.804 --> 07:13.930
That's true, but...

07:14.097 --> 07:16.057
In your premonition,
it was a man who killed me.

07:16.224 --> 07:18.476
Well, I'm going to Buckland's
to meet a female client,

07:18.643 --> 07:20.728
and Claire will be with me
every step of the way.

07:20.895 --> 07:24.065
Besides, now that you've warned me,
I'll watch my back.

07:24.232 --> 07:26.901
- I can handle this. Promise.
- The promise that we want from you

07:27.068 --> 07:30.071
is that you'll come straight home
from Buckland's.

07:30.738 --> 07:33.074
Will it stop you from worrying?

07:47.255 --> 07:49.966
The client's in my office. Remember
what I told you on the phone.

07:50.133 --> 07:52.844
This women's family
has more money than God,

07:53.010 --> 07:57.181
and if we land this account, it could
put Buckland's in the black for years.

07:57.348 --> 08:01.727
- Exactly. You ready?
- Course I am.

08:03.354 --> 08:06.190
Helena Statler, I would like you to meet
Prue Halliwell,

08:06.357 --> 08:08.859
one of our best and brightest
young specialists.

08:09.068 --> 08:10.570
- Hi.
- "Best and brightest."

08:10.736 --> 08:14.532
- That's quite an introduction.
- Yes, it is. Maybe I should get a raise.

08:14.699 --> 08:16.867
Let's have a seat, shall we?

08:17.702 --> 08:22.498
Miss Halliwell, my brother and I hold
an extensive collection of antiquities.

08:22.707 --> 08:24.333
If we were to retain your firm,

08:24.500 --> 08:27.086
you'd be cataloguing, appraising
and selling the finest pieces

08:27.253 --> 08:30.381
you'd see in your career,
maybe your life.

08:30.589 --> 08:33.551
Just what kind of collection
are we talking about, exactly?

08:33.759 --> 08:36.428
The kind that occupies three buildings
at Warehouse Flats.

08:36.636 --> 08:39.890
We have art and artefacts from every
period and movement in history,

08:40.099 --> 08:42.851
from Egyptian mummies
to Jasper Johns.

08:43.977 --> 08:46.564
We would want a sample appraisal,
of course.

08:46.730 --> 08:49.066
Prue will be there today, if you like.

08:49.275 --> 08:50.776
At the Warehouse Flats?

08:50.985 --> 08:52.528
Is that a problem?

08:54.405 --> 08:56.949
No. No, I'm sure that I can handle it.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.460
Twelve potato ricers? What kind of
restaurant needs 12 potato ricers?

09:08.627 --> 09:12.339
Just put them in back
with the box of the lemon reamers.

09:12.506 --> 09:13.924
- Okay.
- I just called Buckland's,

09:14.091 --> 09:16.510
and they said that Prue
left the office for a meeting.

09:16.677 --> 09:18.679
What? She promised
she would go straight home.

09:18.845 --> 09:19.888
Wait, it gets worse.

09:20.055 --> 09:22.724
<i>I finally found that crystal sword
in the Book of Shadows...</i>

09:26.228 --> 09:28.105
It's the symbol of the Lords of War.

09:28.272 --> 09:30.399
They're a clan
of supernatural warriors.

09:30.565 --> 09:32.401
They've been around
since time began.

09:32.567 --> 09:34.986
- What do they want?
- To start war.

09:35.445 --> 09:37.447
They've started most of the major wars
in history.

09:37.614 --> 09:39.783
Once they're done in one place,
they get reincarnated

09:39.950 --> 09:41.993
in some other part of the world
and start all over.

09:42.202 --> 09:44.913
<i>- So is he flesh and blood?
- Yes, but the Book says that</i>

09:45.080 --> 09:48.208
as long as they have their sword,
they're not only protected,

09:48.375 --> 09:50.919
they're immune to
the weapons of man.

09:51.086 --> 09:53.922
So we have this invulnerable guy
running around with a sword

09:54.089 --> 09:55.173
who wants to start a war?

09:55.340 --> 09:58.677
The Lords of War may be invulnerable,
but they do have a code of honour.

09:58.843 --> 10:02.681
And when one of them is disgraced,
he has to steal his abilities back.

10:02.889 --> 10:04.474
So, what does this have to do
with Prue?

10:04.641 --> 10:08.436
One of the things he has to steal back
is the magic of a first-born witch.

10:08.645 --> 10:10.689
They're supposed to be the strongest.

10:11.398 --> 10:14.067
- Piper, where...?
- Not now. Not now.

10:14.234 --> 10:17.404
Okay. I'll call the night-shift manager,
see if he can cover for me.

10:17.570 --> 10:21.991
You call Prue on her cell phone.
We gotta find her, quickly, okay?

10:43.680 --> 10:45.807
Miss Statler?

10:49.602 --> 10:51.437
Please.

10:52.313 --> 10:53.689
Miss Statler.

10:55.858 --> 10:58.444
Hello, Miss Halliwell.

10:59.278 --> 11:01.989
Oh, I'm sorry,
I hope I didn't scare you.

11:02.198 --> 11:07.328
- No, I don't really scare easily.
- What do you think of our collection?

11:07.787 --> 11:10.748
I think that you have exquisite taste.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.126
My brother and I have been collecting
our entire lives.

11:14.293 --> 11:15.628
It's our binding passion.

11:15.795 --> 11:18.506
- Is this a Roman vessel?
- Why don't you tell me.

11:18.673 --> 11:20.883
I've never seen one
in such good condition.

11:21.092 --> 11:23.010
The handles represent Venus,

11:23.177 --> 11:26.889
and the relief details scenes
of Roman baths in Caracalla.

11:27.056 --> 11:31.560
It probably dates back to 210 B.C.
It's very rare and priceless.

11:31.727 --> 11:34.939
Wow, Claire, was right.
You really are something.

11:35.815 --> 11:38.692
What can you tell me about this item?

11:41.862 --> 11:42.905
It's a pillory.

11:43.072 --> 11:46.617
The markings are Castilian, so I'd say
it dates back to the Inquisition.

11:48.786 --> 11:50.621
But it's missing a piece.

11:50.788 --> 11:53.874
The victim's arms are held in place
by a bolted restraint.

11:55.793 --> 11:58.629
Prue Halliwell, my brother, Gabriel.

11:59.171 --> 12:02.091
I'd shake your hand,
but it's clearly otherwise engaged.

12:02.257 --> 12:05.094
- What are you doing?
- Killing a witch.

12:05.260 --> 12:08.263
Your ancestor's power emanated
from her hands.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.724
- No doubt yours does too.
- My ancestor?

12:10.891 --> 12:12.309
A witch named Brianna.

12:12.976 --> 12:14.937
You're not the only one
who's done her research.

12:50.388 --> 12:51.598
How did she do that?

12:52.390 --> 12:53.642
She's not like her ancestor.

12:53.809 --> 12:56.603
She channels her power
through her eyes, not her hands.

12:56.770 --> 12:59.189
I won't make that mistake again.

12:59.356 --> 13:02.817
She knows about us now. We have to
move fast, attack her at home.

13:02.984 --> 13:06.821
No. Home is where she has
the power of three to protect her.

13:06.988 --> 13:09.908
We'll think of another way.

13:12.994 --> 13:16.373
I hit Gabriel in the chest with an axe,
and he didn't even bleed.

13:16.539 --> 13:19.959
As long as he has his sword,
he's immune to the weapons of men,

13:20.126 --> 13:24.005
which we could have told you
if you hadn't turned off your cell phone.

13:24.172 --> 13:25.673
Yeah, well, I got away, and I'm fine.

13:26.382 --> 13:30.553
Okay, I found our ancestor Brianna.

13:30.720 --> 13:33.431
She was our great-great-great-aunt.

13:33.598 --> 13:36.267
She could move things
with her mind, like Prue.

13:36.434 --> 13:39.145
Now, she disgraced Gabriel
during the Crimean War.

13:39.312 --> 13:41.105
She used her power
to take away his sword.

13:41.272 --> 13:44.817
I guess Gabriel is trying to earn
his abilities back.

13:44.984 --> 13:47.320
Great, so some guy couldn't keep it
in his sheath,

13:47.487 --> 13:48.738
and now I'm marked for death.

13:48.905 --> 13:52.450
Well, some men can be very sensitive
about their weapons.

13:53.076 --> 13:55.703
Lords of War and their weapons
are supposed to be inseparable,

13:55.870 --> 13:57.038
like Thor and his hammer.

13:57.205 --> 14:02.126
And I guess Brianna was able to send
his sword hundreds of miles away.

14:02.293 --> 14:04.796
All right, a sword I can move.
But hundreds of miles away?

14:04.962 --> 14:06.047
I'm not that powerful.

14:06.214 --> 14:09.842
I thought about that,
and I found this incantation.

14:10.009 --> 14:13.554
"To multiply your strength,
recite these words at length."

14:15.723 --> 14:18.893
All right, so all I have to do is say
this incantation, and I'll be stronger.

14:19.060 --> 14:22.480
Hopefully strong enough
to separate Gabriel and his sword.

14:22.897 --> 14:25.942
- Sounds like a plan to me.
- Time out. Bad idea.

14:26.108 --> 14:27.443
Why, because it's mine?

14:27.610 --> 14:31.447
No, because there might be
a power-of-three solution to this.

14:31.614 --> 14:33.949
<i>Yeah, but the Book of Shadows
doesn't say that.</i>

14:34.116 --> 14:36.577
And besides, it's me he's after,
not you or Phoebe.

14:36.744 --> 14:39.663
Okay, okay, so maybe we should just
lay low for a few days.

14:39.830 --> 14:43.417
- You know, use up our sick days.
- And wait for Gabriel to find us?

14:43.584 --> 14:45.628
- No.
- He might hurt one of you to get to me.

14:45.836 --> 14:47.171
I will not take that risk.

14:47.338 --> 14:51.425
Okay, Prue, but... Wait. Okay, wait.
At least let us vote on this.

14:51.634 --> 14:56.805
All right. All in favour of me saying
the incantation raise their hands.

15:02.186 --> 15:04.688
Sorry, sis, majority rules.

15:04.897 --> 15:06.607
But, Prue...

15:07.024 --> 15:10.778
<i>"Take my powers, blessed be
Multiply their strength by three"</i>

15:12.654 --> 15:14.323
- What?
- You know what.

15:14.531 --> 15:16.408
I'm sorry,
but I really don't have a problem

15:16.575 --> 15:17.993
with Prue saying the incantation.

15:18.202 --> 15:19.787
The problem is we're in this together,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.122
and together, we're supposed
to solve our problems.

15:22.289 --> 15:25.584
<i>And together, we rely on the Book
of Shadows when we're in trouble.</i>

15:26.210 --> 15:29.338
Think about it, Piper. What's
the worst thing that can happen?

15:32.507 --> 15:35.010
- What did I tell you?
- Don't... Don't be fresh to me.

15:35.218 --> 15:39.473
- You'd better run. Hurry.
- I'm going, I'm going.

15:44.645 --> 15:46.438
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

15:56.782 --> 15:59.367
- Prue?
- What?

15:59.910 --> 16:01.578
Okay.

16:03.914 --> 16:06.333
One, two, three.

16:14.049 --> 16:18.219
Hello. There are other people in
this house that have styling needs too.

16:18.428 --> 16:21.598
- Is there a Prue in there also?
- One of them, yes.

16:21.806 --> 16:24.726
I'll have to wash my hair in the kitchen
sink to get to work on time.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.103
Do you know which one
is the real Prue yet?

16:27.270 --> 16:30.148
Oh, I don't know. It could be
the upstairs-bathroom-hogging Prue

16:30.315 --> 16:32.358
or the downstairs-
bathroom-hogging Prue

16:32.567 --> 16:35.528
or the sitting-in-the-kitchen-
drinking-all-the-coffee Prue.

16:36.446 --> 16:38.448
- Is there a problem?
- Aside from you going off

16:38.615 --> 16:40.783
and casting a spell that's kept
all our bathrooms busy

16:40.950 --> 16:42.702
for the past three hours, nothing.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.579
Don't blame me.
I didn't cast the spell.

16:44.954 --> 16:48.499
- Great. You're a clone.
- Well, no, I'm not exactly a clone.

16:48.666 --> 16:50.043
I do have all of Prue's memories

16:50.209 --> 16:54.422
up until the time that she cast the
spell. So in a lot of ways, I am Prue.

16:54.631 --> 16:55.882
Then it is your fault.

16:56.090 --> 16:59.302
No, it's not, and neither is
the lack of hot water.

16:59.510 --> 17:03.681
- Oh, you didn't. Jeez.
- This is ridiculous.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.934
<i>This is like... This is like
The Parent Trap, with a B cup.</i>

17:07.393 --> 17:11.314
I think I might have just found a way to
take some of the Disney out of our life.

17:15.108 --> 17:16.777
- You look great.
- No, you look great.

17:16.986 --> 17:18.945
- Is my skirt tight enough?
- Yes.

17:19.155 --> 17:20.698
It's perfect.

17:22.867 --> 17:25.536
Okay, which one of you
is the real Prue?

17:27.038 --> 17:28.539
Stop that.

17:28.748 --> 17:32.460
- I'm the real Prue.
- Okay, then you get the black sweater.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.004
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm colour-coding.

17:35.171 --> 17:37.673
It's the only way we're gonna
be able to tell you apart.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.634
- Okay, clone A gets the pink sweater.
- Thank you.

17:40.801 --> 17:42.678
- Clone B gets the blue one.
- Thanks.

17:42.887 --> 17:44.221
Good thinking with the sweaters.

17:44.388 --> 17:46.807
Thanks, but it's only
a temporary solution.

17:46.974 --> 17:48.517
And what about the spell?

17:48.684 --> 17:51.645
Oh, the spell is temporary too. We're
only here as long as we're needed.

17:51.854 --> 17:53.939
We were called for a reason.
Once the reason's gone,

17:54.106 --> 17:55.566
the spell wears out, we disappear.

17:55.733 --> 17:59.153
- Once we vanquish Gabriel.
- How are we planning on doing this?

17:59.361 --> 18:01.363
Funny that you should ask.
See, I was thinking...

18:01.530 --> 18:04.199
That we could find Gabriel by tracking
down the ownership records

18:04.366 --> 18:06.035
to that Roman vessel.

18:06.201 --> 18:08.454
In Buckland's antiquities database.

18:09.538 --> 18:12.666
That's why I called my assistant...

18:13.667 --> 18:15.878
Our assistant,
and she's already on it.

18:16.587 --> 18:19.465
- Are we good or what?
- So once you know where he lives,

18:19.631 --> 18:22.760
are you sure you have the power
to do the job?

18:22.968 --> 18:26.221
Observe. Ladies, shall we?

18:40.193 --> 18:42.404
Enough said?

18:44.531 --> 18:45.616
I'll get that.

18:45.782 --> 18:48.660
- I'll get the phone.
- Wait, I should...

18:48.869 --> 18:49.911
Should hide.

18:54.291 --> 18:56.209
- Andy, hi.
- Hi.

18:56.376 --> 18:59.171
- Can I come in?
- Now's not really a good time.

18:59.379 --> 19:01.465
Wow, that is a nice tie.

19:01.673 --> 19:04.676
- Thanks.
- So, what did I do now?

19:05.177 --> 19:08.847
- I don't know, you tell me.
- Whatever it is, I have an alibi.

19:09.055 --> 19:10.724
Good thing this is a social call then.

19:10.932 --> 19:14.936
Social call, really?
Now you're starting to look suspicious.

19:15.103 --> 19:16.146
Remember a few months ago

19:16.313 --> 19:19.316
we ordered tickets
to the Bay Area Music Awards?

19:20.567 --> 19:23.945
They came in the mail.
I thought you might want them.

19:26.740 --> 19:29.868
- That is so sweet.
- You can take anyone you want,

19:30.076 --> 19:34.205
even an old boyfriend who's just a
friend now but who loves good music.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.416
I'll take that under consideration.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.042
Yeah, you ponder that.

19:40.587 --> 19:42.380
I'll see you.

19:48.261 --> 19:52.473
- Why did we break up with him?
- He broke up with us first, remember?

19:52.932 --> 19:54.517
Too bad.

19:57.604 --> 19:59.230
Houston, we have a problem.

19:59.439 --> 20:00.982
Raging clone hormones?

20:01.566 --> 20:04.235
No. That was Claire calling.

20:04.610 --> 20:08.781
She said that if I... Well, one of us
don't get to the office pronto,

20:08.990 --> 20:12.452
- you'll be looking for a new job.
- Okay. Okay, we can swing this.

20:12.827 --> 20:15.496
No, no. Wait, you're not seriously
thinking of leaving the house.

20:15.663 --> 20:17.707
You can't hide three yous
at the office.

20:17.874 --> 20:19.750
Two of us may not be able
to separate Gabriel

20:19.917 --> 20:22.086
from his sword,
but we can certainly fight him off.

20:22.295 --> 20:24.714
Which means two of us can go
and save Prue's job,

20:24.881 --> 20:27.633
and whoever's left behind
can go to the Quake with Piper.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.846
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Forget it.
- Piper, you have an active power.

20:32.013 --> 20:36.142
Besides, Phoebe, your premonition,
it didn't happen at Quake, right?

20:36.350 --> 20:40.187
- I can't be sure.
- Still, worse-case scenario,

20:40.354 --> 20:43.232
Piper freezes Gabriel, and she runs.

20:43.441 --> 20:45.818
No, no, I don't like this idea.
I don't like it at all.

20:45.985 --> 20:48.237
I think we should all stay together,
all five of us.

20:48.404 --> 20:49.613
I think Piper's right.

20:49.822 --> 20:52.783
<i>The Book said it requires the
strength of three to take on Gabriel.</i>

20:52.950 --> 20:56.162
- It's not safe to split up.
- Okay, all who don't like the plan?

20:57.580 --> 20:59.123
All who do?

21:01.041 --> 21:04.753
Wow, once again,
majority rules. Ladies.

21:20.227 --> 21:22.229
Hi, is Claire around?

21:22.438 --> 21:24.857
She's been buzzing every 15 minutes.
You want me to get her?

21:25.065 --> 21:29.278
Not yet. Did you dig up the information
on the Roman vessel?

21:29.445 --> 21:31.655
Hot off the LaserJet.

21:33.198 --> 21:34.741
Gabriel Statler's address. Good.

21:35.325 --> 21:38.620
Okay, now I need for you to get me
photocopies of all my sales files

21:38.787 --> 21:41.290
- for the quarter.
- That could take hours.

21:41.498 --> 21:42.791
You're right. You know what,

21:42.958 --> 21:45.210
I need you to get me copies
of everyone's files.

21:45.419 --> 21:49.006
- That could take days.
- Then you better start now. Bye-bye.

21:58.056 --> 22:00.434
Did you have to make her photocopy
all the files?

22:00.642 --> 22:02.769
You wanted her to see us together?

22:03.687 --> 22:06.731
No, but you didn't even thank her,
and you were so bossy.

22:06.940 --> 22:08.650
That's why we're called "bosses."

22:08.817 --> 22:11.945
All right, well, now that we have
Gabriel Statler's address...

22:12.154 --> 22:15.407
No. All right, you stay here.
I will talk to Claire first.

22:15.615 --> 22:18.201
- Why do you get to talk to Claire?
- I still have to work here

22:18.368 --> 22:19.703
when all this is over.

22:19.870 --> 22:23.873
- Prue, are you there?
- Claire.

22:26.084 --> 22:29.045
- Claire, hi.
- I want an explanation for yesterday.

22:29.254 --> 22:30.797
- What do you mean?
- Helena called

22:31.006 --> 22:33.258
to tell me that she was so offended
by your behaviour

22:33.425 --> 22:35.427
that she's taking her collection
to Christie's.

22:35.635 --> 22:36.886
What happened?

22:37.095 --> 22:39.681
Claire, I've already
made arrangements

22:39.848 --> 22:41.599
to make a personal apology

22:41.808 --> 22:44.269
and put Buckland's
back in the running.

22:44.436 --> 22:48.940
As a matter of fact, I convinced
Miss Statler to meet me at her estate.

22:49.107 --> 22:50.733
See, here's the address.

22:53.987 --> 22:56.447
Okay. You really think
you can get this account back?

22:56.906 --> 23:00.243
- I'd stake my job on it.
- Good, because you just did.

23:00.451 --> 23:02.787
All right, I'll get my briefcase,
and we'll take my car.

23:02.954 --> 23:06.124
- No.
- No? Oh, yes, yes, yes.

23:06.291 --> 23:09.127
I'm not gonna leave you alone
with that client again.

23:11.504 --> 23:13.297
- What was that?
- Hail Mary pass.

23:13.756 --> 23:16.759
Okay. All right, let us think.

23:19.637 --> 23:22.598
I got it. I will take Claire
to the wrong address,

23:22.765 --> 23:25.017
pretend that we've been stood up
or something.

23:25.226 --> 23:27.979
You call the other one of us at Quake.

23:28.187 --> 23:31.607
- I love it when I'm so decisive.
- Okay, look,

23:31.774 --> 23:35.111
you go get the other Prue
and take her to the manor, okay?

23:35.278 --> 23:37.196
And we'll finish this.

23:41.701 --> 23:43.619
Yeah, hey, Pheebs, it's me.

23:44.287 --> 23:46.414
No, the real one. I'm just checking in.

23:46.580 --> 23:48.165
We do that a lot, don't we?

23:48.374 --> 23:49.417
Check in with our sisters,

23:49.583 --> 23:50.793
make sure that they're okay.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.087
Don't you think
that if there was a problem,

23:53.254 --> 23:55.631
they would call us and let us know?

23:56.799 --> 23:59.510
Phoebe, I'll call you back.
I have to go yell at myself.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.180
Prue!

24:06.517 --> 24:09.478
- Hi. Hi, you ready to go?
- Wow, did you change your sweater?

24:09.645 --> 24:12.731
Yeah, black's more my colour.
Come on.

24:17.861 --> 24:21.031
<i>- Thank you for calling Quake.
- Piper, it's me.</i>

24:21.198 --> 24:23.200
- What colour?
- The pink one.

24:23.409 --> 24:25.119
<i>The real Prue just left
with Claire.</i>

24:25.285 --> 24:27.621
Look, I need you to get
the blue one to the manor.

24:27.788 --> 24:30.332
We're meeting Prue there
before we go to Gabriel's estate.

24:30.541 --> 24:33.043
I've been thinking. Have you guys
thought about what happens

24:33.252 --> 24:35.712
after you separate Gabriel
from his sword?

24:35.879 --> 24:38.674
<i>The Book says that she took
the sword away, and that was it. Why?</i>

24:38.841 --> 24:41.885
Well, what if he still comes after you?
He's a warlord, remember?

24:42.052 --> 24:46.139
Once we get the sword, we'll destroy it.
He would be crazy to take us on.

24:46.306 --> 24:49.601
Piper, don't worry. We have the plan,
and we have the power.

24:49.768 --> 24:51.728
I just don't wanna lose you.

24:52.104 --> 24:56.400
- Any of you.
- You won't. I promise. Bye.

25:00.028 --> 25:01.446
The pink...

25:03.573 --> 25:07.369
...one just called
and wants you to meet her.

25:07.577 --> 25:10.914
Prue, what are you doing?

25:11.832 --> 25:14.626
Trying today's special.
You know, I think it needs

25:14.793 --> 25:16.670
a teeny bit more Parmesan.

25:16.837 --> 25:21.132
I'm sure it's fine, since today's special
is glazed short ribs.

25:21.299 --> 25:24.970
Then forget the Parmesan, because
if anybody knows food, it's my Piper.

25:25.512 --> 25:26.930
What's your specialty?

25:27.347 --> 25:29.224
All right, come on,
you guys get to work.

25:29.432 --> 25:33.436
There you go.
Yeah, I know, it's thrilling. All right.

25:33.979 --> 25:35.563
Yeah, I guess I shouldn't
pet the help.

25:36.856 --> 25:38.441
What has gotten into you?

25:38.650 --> 25:42.612
Or who has gotten into you? Because
you're nothing like the real Prue.

25:42.779 --> 25:44.656
Actually, I'm exactly like the real Prue,

25:44.823 --> 25:47.450
just the side that doesn't get to
come out and play enough.

25:48.660 --> 25:54.124
I'm the flip side
of the corporate conservative clone.

25:54.332 --> 25:55.458
All right, that's enough.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.961
Get out of my kitchen
before my cooks overheat.

25:58.503 --> 26:02.215
That's... No, I don't want that.
Thank you, really.

26:19.524 --> 26:21.192
Blinded by the light?

26:27.198 --> 26:28.449
You cut me, witch!

26:32.703 --> 26:34.497
Prue?

26:40.002 --> 26:41.671
Prue.

26:45.675 --> 26:47.927
Come on.

26:48.094 --> 26:50.554
Give it to me.

26:50.721 --> 26:53.224
Where's her soul?
Where's her magic?

26:53.391 --> 26:56.060
I've been tricked!

26:57.478 --> 26:58.979
She has none.

26:59.146 --> 27:01.315
Whoever this is,
it's not the real witch.

27:04.443 --> 27:06.362
Are you okay?

27:07.363 --> 27:09.114
No, I'm not.

27:17.540 --> 27:20.209
Autopsy's scheduled for first thing
tomorrow morning,

27:20.417 --> 27:23.295
but the case officer said you might
be able to ID the body now.

27:23.462 --> 27:25.673
It's a homicide victim, right?

27:26.256 --> 27:28.634
Somebody ran her through
with a bladed weapon,

27:28.801 --> 27:31.011
so I'd call that a big yes.

27:35.307 --> 27:39.395
No ID on the body,
but those are her personal effects.

27:47.611 --> 27:49.279
Prue.

28:09.216 --> 28:11.093
- Hey, Andy.
- Phoebe.

28:11.259 --> 28:13.053
Sorry.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.430
What did you do?

28:16.056 --> 28:17.516
This is serious, Phoebe.

28:18.308 --> 28:20.560
Look, in homicide,
I've done this many times before,

28:20.727 --> 28:22.813
but this is the worst.

28:23.021 --> 28:24.147
What...?

28:24.981 --> 28:26.691
Prue's dead.

28:26.858 --> 28:30.237
They found her body dumped
in a ravine near the Presidio.

28:31.696 --> 28:34.157
Are you sure that it was Prue?

28:34.491 --> 28:35.825
I saw the body.

28:37.702 --> 28:40.497
Investigating officers

28:40.664 --> 28:42.874
found a couple of drops of blood

28:43.041 --> 28:45.001
on a path away from the ravine.

28:45.168 --> 28:47.212
Blood that probably belonged
to the murderer.

28:47.379 --> 28:49.923
- What was she wearing, Andy?
- Excuse me?

28:50.131 --> 28:51.883
What colour was she wearing, Andy?

28:52.050 --> 28:54.135
What colour? Phoebe,
did you just hear what I said?

28:54.302 --> 28:56.054
Okay, Andy, now I'm serious.

28:56.221 --> 28:59.140
Any idea what colour sweater she
was wearing when they found her?

28:59.307 --> 29:02.268
I know it sounds strange, Andy,
but it's important.

29:02.894 --> 29:04.354
I think the report said pink.

29:05.855 --> 29:07.148
Thank God.

29:07.357 --> 29:11.069
I just told you I saw your sister dead,
and you're relieved?

29:12.362 --> 29:15.865
Well, Andy, it's no secret

29:16.032 --> 29:17.992
that we fought at times.

29:18.159 --> 29:19.994
What the hell kind of answer
is that, Phoebe?

29:20.161 --> 29:22.914
Look, if you have any more ideas
about how to rearrange my business,

29:23.081 --> 29:25.124
- you can just save it, because...
- Yeah, yeah.

29:25.291 --> 29:26.417
Hi, Andy.

29:27.293 --> 29:30.671
- Andy, nice tie.
- Prue, I was just at the morgue, and...

29:34.509 --> 29:36.552
Okay, I may not be an expert,

29:36.761 --> 29:39.847
but I think this is the time
when somebody hides.

29:40.014 --> 29:42.767
- Prue, what's the matter?
- What is he doing here?

29:42.975 --> 29:45.019
He saw you dead at the morgue,
obviously a clone,

29:45.186 --> 29:47.355
and he thought it'd be better
to break the news here.

29:47.521 --> 29:48.689
One of us is dead. I knew it.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.691
- I felt it happen.
- What do you mean?

29:50.858 --> 29:54.403
- I didn't feel anything.
- I was in the car with Claire,

29:54.570 --> 29:56.489
and when she died,
I felt like it was me.

29:57.865 --> 30:00.493
Okay, but one crisis at a time.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.578
Prue, you gotta go. Hide. Go. Get.

30:10.961 --> 30:14.507
And I was in the morgue,
and you were on a slab.

30:14.715 --> 30:16.217
Andy, you know what they say.

30:16.383 --> 30:18.093
Everybody has a twin
out there somewhere.

30:18.260 --> 30:19.595
Not like this.

30:19.762 --> 30:21.847
There has to be a better explanation
for what I saw.

30:22.056 --> 30:25.434
- Why do we have to come up with it?
- I know what I saw.

30:25.893 --> 30:29.521
Okay, look, Andy, it means
the world to me that you came,

30:29.688 --> 30:31.148
but I'm here.

30:31.774 --> 30:33.692
And believe me,
I didn't get killed today.

30:33.859 --> 30:36.779
You can see I'm very much alive.
And I'm fine, I promise.

30:36.987 --> 30:38.947
Can't argue with that.

30:45.913 --> 30:47.498
By the way,

30:48.665 --> 30:50.459
did you make up your mind
about the concert?

30:51.168 --> 30:53.003
What concert?

30:53.712 --> 30:56.089
The Bay Area Music Awards.

30:56.256 --> 30:58.884
Oh, you mean those tickets
we ordered months ago.

31:00.302 --> 31:02.554
Did those tickets finally come in?

31:02.721 --> 31:05.891
Yeah, they came in the mail.

31:08.018 --> 31:09.519
Maybe I'll bring them over sometime.

31:20.322 --> 31:21.948
All right, we need to do something.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.950
Gabriel's going to find us,

31:24.159 --> 31:26.161
and there aren't enough of us left
to defeat him.

31:26.328 --> 31:28.997
- How do you know he's still after you?
- Because I'm still here.

31:29.164 --> 31:31.208
And as long as I'm needed,
the spell is still on.

31:31.374 --> 31:33.752
Do you think Gabriel knows
he didn't get the real Prue?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.212
I'd bet on it.

31:35.378 --> 31:37.172
We're gonna need more us's
to fight him.

31:37.631 --> 31:39.257
- More Prues?
- Look, don't worry,

31:39.424 --> 31:41.176
I'm never casting that spell again.

31:41.343 --> 31:42.886
I wont risk any more me's.

31:43.094 --> 31:45.263
- What about our plan?
- We will still use our powers

31:45.430 --> 31:46.806
to sneak into Gabriel's estate.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.601
Except we won't be alone
when we find him.

31:51.227 --> 31:52.395
Prue, we're geniuses.

31:52.937 --> 31:55.106
What are you people thinking?

31:55.273 --> 31:57.984
Gabriel Statler
is a flesh-and-blood person

31:58.151 --> 31:59.819
with a flesh-and-blood sister.

32:00.487 --> 32:04.157
The only thing that protects him, that
makes him invulnerable, is that sword.

32:04.324 --> 32:08.453
And Gabriel has this weird,
binding passion for Helena.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.497
So if we grab her,
we can use her as leverage.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.540
- A sword for his sister.
- That's your plan?

32:12.707 --> 32:14.792
You think he won't protect
his own flesh and blood?

32:14.959 --> 32:17.003
Okay, look, we grab Helena,

32:17.170 --> 32:19.631
and he either trades his sword
for her life,

32:19.797 --> 32:22.133
or we use her to buy more time
until we figure out a way

32:22.300 --> 32:23.593
to separate him from his sword.

32:23.968 --> 32:27.055
- Okay, so we'll go with you.
- No way.

32:27.722 --> 32:31.100
Today, I felt my own death.
And when that sword went in,

32:31.309 --> 32:32.727
I felt my life slipping away.

32:32.935 --> 32:36.189
I couldn't even imagine if something
like that happened to either one of you.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.859
Okay? I'm more protective
of you guys.

32:45.156 --> 32:46.741
Anything from surveillance?

32:46.949 --> 32:49.285
I saw at least two women
identical to Prue Halliwell.

32:49.744 --> 32:51.746
One was leaving the restaurant
in a blue sweater,

32:51.913 --> 32:54.332
the other was entering the manor
in a black sweater.

32:54.498 --> 32:56.834
We're gonna have to chance
an attack on her at home.

32:57.043 --> 33:00.755
Just wait until the hours
right before dawn,

33:00.921 --> 33:05.259
when they're certain to be asleep
and vulnerable.

33:10.473 --> 33:12.266
Checkmate.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.939
Can we have a word with Prue?

33:19.148 --> 33:20.357
- Sure.
- Sure.

33:20.649 --> 33:22.902
- The real Prue.
- Yeah, what's up?

33:23.736 --> 33:26.530
In private, please, if you don't mind.

33:26.739 --> 33:30.034
It's important. Sister stuff.
No offence.

33:30.743 --> 33:32.244
None taken.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.747
All right, I'll wait out in the hall.

33:39.001 --> 33:42.713
I know what you guys are going to say.
Please don't try and talk me out of it.

33:42.880 --> 33:45.549
Okay, forgive us
for not wanting you dead.

33:45.716 --> 33:48.427
No, I appreciate that.
It's just that we'll be fine.

33:48.594 --> 33:50.429
You don't know that.
The warehouse was a trap.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.473
How do you know his house
isn't as dangerous?

33:52.681 --> 33:55.642
Yeah, the Statlers don't seem like
the white-picket-fence type.

33:56.018 --> 33:57.227
Well, it's our only option.

33:57.394 --> 33:59.313
No, it isn't. Why go to him
when you're stronger

33:59.480 --> 34:00.689
in your own home with us?

34:00.898 --> 34:03.567
And wait for Gabriel to find us?
I don't think so.

34:03.775 --> 34:04.818
He's a strategist, Prue.

34:04.985 --> 34:08.655
Every move he's made has been
carefully planned. He's studied you.

34:09.114 --> 34:12.199
And if he's learned anything about you,
it's how protective you are.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.203
He knows you'll risk yourself
in order to save others,

34:15.411 --> 34:16.621
especially your sisters.

34:16.830 --> 34:18.248
It's exactly what he wants.

34:18.456 --> 34:20.667
You'll only think that you have
the upper hand.

34:21.001 --> 34:23.503
Okay, just for a moment,

34:23.670 --> 34:26.297
don't think of us as sisters
that you need to protect.

34:26.465 --> 34:29.134
Think of us as sisters
who can help you defend.

34:29.342 --> 34:32.304
You guys are right.
And you're right about Gabriel too.

34:32.471 --> 34:36.641
It's far too dangerous.
Okay, I need to...

34:36.808 --> 34:39.768
We need to come up
with another plan.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.855
So you guys have to tell
the other me.

34:42.022 --> 34:44.357
You might be having this conversation
all over again.

34:44.565 --> 34:47.110
- I'm not talking to that clone.
- You have to.

34:47.277 --> 34:49.321
Did anybody take notes?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.906
I'm not talking to that clone.

34:54.576 --> 34:55.909
Prue?

34:56.077 --> 34:57.329
She's gone.

34:57.495 --> 34:59.372
Yeah, to Gabriel Statler's estate.

34:59.539 --> 35:01.374
It's exactly what you would've done,
isn't it?

35:01.541 --> 35:02.876
Yeah. She went to save all of us.

35:03.043 --> 35:06.463
All right, we have to stop her
before she does something.

35:07.422 --> 35:08.965
Gabriel.

35:09.591 --> 35:12.760
Gabriel. Gabriel!

35:18.433 --> 35:22.812
- My God, Helena.
- She tied me up.

35:27.358 --> 35:31.988
This, in war terms, is what I believe
they call a reversal of fortune.

35:39.454 --> 35:41.497
I'll make it easy for you.

35:41.664 --> 35:43.332
Your sword for your sister.

35:49.088 --> 35:53.134
Done. There's only one problem.
You're not the real Prue Halliwell.

35:53.676 --> 35:55.928
Any woman smart enough
to clone herself

35:56.137 --> 35:58.514
would not make the mistake
of confronting me here.

35:58.681 --> 36:01.601
So tell me,
how many of you are there?

36:06.439 --> 36:07.690
So then you're the last clone.

36:10.151 --> 36:11.527
Let my sister go,

36:11.736 --> 36:13.946
and I promise to make it quick
and painless

36:14.155 --> 36:16.866
for you and the real Prue.

36:22.746 --> 36:23.998
Don't make me do this.

36:24.331 --> 36:27.459
Your sword for your sister, please.

36:40.848 --> 36:43.809
Who has the reversal
of fortune now?

36:49.606 --> 36:51.900
- Are you all right?
- What's going on?

36:52.735 --> 36:54.153
He's killing her.

36:54.319 --> 36:56.238
Oh, God, I can feel the sword.

36:56.655 --> 36:57.948
I can't breathe.

37:01.660 --> 37:04.246
It's over. She's gone.

37:15.090 --> 37:17.259
Okay, now would be a good time
for plan B.

37:17.426 --> 37:19.928
What about the evidence
that Andy talked about?

37:20.095 --> 37:22.931
The trail of blood leaving the ravine
where they found the first Prue.

37:23.098 --> 37:24.766
We can't assume it's Gabriel's.

37:24.975 --> 37:26.393
<i>The Book says he's invulnerable.</i>

37:26.601 --> 37:30.105
To the weapons of man.
That wouldn't include a crystal sword

37:30.272 --> 37:31.773
that sucks away your soul.

37:32.107 --> 37:36.027
Right, but I've already proven that you
can't take his sword away from him.

37:36.194 --> 37:37.904
Why do we have to take it away?

37:38.113 --> 37:41.783
Maybe we should try to bring Gabriel
and his sword even closer.

37:44.870 --> 37:47.414
Pheebs, you are so smart.

37:59.718 --> 38:01.469
Speaking of getting closer,

38:01.636 --> 38:04.014
I think Gabriel's on his way here.

38:13.356 --> 38:15.108
And these fingerprints
are cross-referenced?

38:15.275 --> 38:17.861
Okay, I fingerprinted
Jane Doe myself.

38:18.069 --> 38:20.446
The reference prints you asked for
for Prudence Halliwell

38:20.613 --> 38:22.824
came out of her birth certificate
from the archives,

38:23.032 --> 38:27.161
which I took the liberty of verifying
through her DMV records.

38:27.328 --> 38:29.998
And Prue Halliwell's prints
are an identical match to Jane Doe's?

38:30.164 --> 38:32.041
Down to the last whorl.

38:33.751 --> 38:37.380
That's statistically impossible. Even
identical twins have a natural variation.

38:37.547 --> 38:39.757
Then I'd get on the horn
to Ripley's Believe It or Not,

38:39.924 --> 38:42.510
because as far as forensic medicine
can tell,

38:42.677 --> 38:45.680
this woman is Prue Halliwell.

38:50.977 --> 38:53.896
You leave Ripley's out of the loop,
along with anyone else who isn't me.

39:21.966 --> 39:23.968
You clever witch.

39:47.658 --> 39:48.867
Hey, check out G.I. Joe.

39:55.332 --> 39:56.917
It worked.

40:00.754 --> 40:02.214
My weapon.

40:02.381 --> 40:03.924
It's all yours.

40:05.592 --> 40:07.594
No!

40:23.026 --> 40:24.403
Peace at last.

40:24.611 --> 40:26.989
Wow, too bad you didn't knock him
back into the statue.

40:32.077 --> 40:35.831
That's his army.
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

40:40.460 --> 40:41.962
Andy, it's 4 in the morning.

40:42.170 --> 40:44.548
This isn't a social call, Prue.
I need you to come with me.

40:44.714 --> 40:47.968
- Where to?
- City morgue. I'll drive.

41:05.443 --> 41:07.112
Are you gonna tell me
what this is about,

41:07.278 --> 41:09.531
because you haven't said a word
since we got in the car.

41:09.739 --> 41:11.700
I'll show you what this is about.

41:17.455 --> 41:19.249
I don't get it.

41:21.417 --> 41:23.503
I had a body on this slab.
She was identical to you,

41:23.711 --> 41:25.171
right down to your fingerprints.

41:25.797 --> 41:28.466
Andy, I don't know
what you want me to say.

41:31.386 --> 41:34.222
Ever since you came back into my life,
it's been one weird coincidence

41:34.389 --> 41:36.224
after another,
and you don't know what to say.

41:36.391 --> 41:38.601
Why don't you tell me
what you wanna hear.

41:41.479 --> 41:44.899
Andy, I'm sorry, but there's nothing
but clothes on that slab,

41:45.066 --> 41:47.360
so why don't you just take me home.

41:57.537 --> 42:00.832
Curiously, the only item found
by the slain body of Helena Statler

42:01.290 --> 42:02.583
was a blue sweater.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.419
That's a shame,
because I kind of liked that sweater.

42:05.628 --> 42:07.421
What's with the gift basket?

42:07.755 --> 42:11.092
It's a thank you for my assistant.
Believe me, she earned it.

42:11.300 --> 42:16.055
Tumbler number 345, 46 and 47.

42:16.264 --> 42:19.350
And that, ladies, is the end
of Quake's yearly inventory.

42:20.351 --> 42:23.270
And the end of crowded bathrooms,
the end of no hot water

42:23.437 --> 42:26.899
and the end of three Prues
hogging all the good clothes.

42:27.066 --> 42:29.568
You know, one day you might hear
what you actually sound like

42:29.735 --> 42:30.903
when you say stuff like that.

42:31.070 --> 42:33.280
And I will find myself
sassy and delightful.

42:33.572 --> 42:34.615
I won't count on it.

42:36.325 --> 42:39.995
All right, to me, myself and I,
and to you guys.

42:40.162 --> 42:42.039
I couldn't have done it without you.
Thank you.

42:42.456 --> 42:46.293
And to me, for kicking
some serious demon butt.

42:46.502 --> 42:48.587
And to clones who vanish
without a trace.

42:48.796 --> 42:50.798
Poor Andy. Do you think
he'll ever figure it out?

42:50.965 --> 42:54.760
I don't know, but I wouldn't
underestimate him.

42:54.927 --> 42:57.805
After what happened this morning,
we're gonna have to be extra careful.
