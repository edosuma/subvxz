13:32.770 --> 13:34.437
IT'S NOT, EXACTLY.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.606
MISS BEADLE CALLS IT
AN ENTERTAINMENT.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.650
ALL THE PARENTS
ARE INVITED TO COME.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.111
SOUNDS LIKE TAKING
PEOPLE'S GOOD TIME
AWAY FROM WORK.

13:42.279 --> 13:46.366
MAMA, I WANT YOU TO COME.
SAY YES. OH, PLEASE.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.619
OH, GINNY,
DON'T PESTER ME.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.664
AW, GINNY,
SINCE YOUR PA DIED,

13:52.832 --> 13:53.998
TAKES EVERY
MOMENT I GOT

13:54.166 --> 13:55.959
JUST TO KEEP
BODY AND SOUL
TOGETHER.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.919
BUT, MA,
IT'S ONLY
ONE MORNING,

13:58.087 --> 13:59.796
AND ALL THE PARENTS
WILL BE THERE.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.048
ALL THE MORE REASON
FOR ME TO KEEP
TO MY HOME.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.134
BESIDES, I DON'T
HAVE A DRESS
FIT TO WEAR.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.179
PLEASE, MA,
JUST THIS ONCE.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.807
OH, GINNY,
DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.

14:10.975 --> 14:14.060
NOW, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR CHORES TO DO.
GO DO THEM.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.992
WELL, THERE'S
NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.743
WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO PLAN ON CLOSING
THE STORE

14:30.911 --> 14:32.203
ON FRIDAY MORNING.
THAT'S ALL.

14:32.371 --> 14:33.496
WILLIE,
USE YOUR FORK.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.622
YES, SIR.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.416
SEEMS KIND OF
EXPENSIVE TO ME,
HARRIET.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.501
WELL, AFTER ALL,
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE

14:38.669 --> 14:40.670
YOUR DAUGHTER'S DEBUT
AS AN ACTRESS,

14:40.838 --> 14:44.007
NOT TO MENTION MINE
AS THE PLAYWRIGHT?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.800
YOU'RE GOING
TO WRITE IT?

14:45.968 --> 14:47.552
MM-HMM.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.598
MOTHER'S THE ONLY PERSON
IN WALNUT GROVE WHO'S
BEEN TO A REAL PLAY.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.182
Nels: YES,
I'M SURE SHE IS.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.519
IT STILL SOUNDS
LIKE A LOT OF TO-DO
ABOUT NOTHING TO ME.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.605
WELL, AFTER ALL,
WILLIE NEEDS A PART,

14:58.772 --> 15:01.065
SO I CAN WRITE
SOMETHING IN IT
FOR HIM.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.276
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
A LITTLE WOMAN.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.153
Harriet: OH,
DON'T BE SILLY.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.864
WELL, THIS IS ONE TIME
I TEND TO AGREE
WITH WILLIE.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.866
YOU OUGHT TO DO
SOMETHING MORE
APPROPRIATE FOR A BOY,

15:10.034 --> 15:12.702
LIKE THIS NEW
MARK TWAIN BOOK,
"TOM SAWYER."

15:12.870 --> 15:15.330
NONE OF THE BOYS
WILL DO ANYTHING
WITH WILLIE.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.416
THEY WOULD IF I DIDN'T
RUN OUT OF LICORICE.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.127
WILLIE, I'VE TOLD YOU,
YOU CAN'T BUY FRIENDS.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.546
I WASN'T.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO RENT THEM.

15:23.714 --> 15:24.923
OH, WILLIE.

15:25.090 --> 15:27.717
I'VE GOT A COPY
OF "TOM SAWYER"
UPSTAIRS.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.636
YOU READ IT.
YOU'LL FIND
SOMETHING IN IT.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.055
A WHOLE BOOK?
THAT COULD
TAKE A YEAR!

15:32.222 --> 15:34.140
NOT IF YOU
WORK AT IT, DEAR.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.392
AFTER ALL,
THERE'S NO SACRIFICE

15:36.560 --> 15:38.478
TOO GREAT
FOR ONE'S ART,

15:38.646 --> 15:40.188
AND BESIDES,
YOU HAVE TO GIVE TO GET.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.856
I DON'T
KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT SACRIFICE,

15:42.024 --> 15:43.191
BUT I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO GIVE

15:43.359 --> 15:44.901
A WHOLE LOT
OF LICORICE.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.573
Willie:
AH, COME ON, FELLAS.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.910
MY PA SAYS "TOM SAWYER"
IS THE BEST BOOK
HE EVER READ.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.954
HE EVEN
MARKED SOME
PAGES IN IT.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.914
I GUESS YOU
WANT TO BE
TOM SAWYER.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.625
YEAH,
BUT IT'S MY
PA'S BOOK.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.086
WHY DON'T YOU
GET HIM TO DO
A PLAY WITH YOU?

16:03.253 --> 16:04.671
I CAN'T
DO THAT,

16:04.838 --> 16:06.965
BUT MA SAYS
WHOEVER'S IN
THE PLAY

16:07.132 --> 16:11.010
CAN HAVE A LICORICE STICK
AND SOME SARSAPARILLA
AFTER WE DO IT.

16:11.178 --> 16:14.222
SURE ARE ASKING
A LOT FOR A LITTLE
LICORICE AND SARSAPARILLA.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.182
I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GET SOME MARBLES.

16:16.350 --> 16:18.434
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOUR PA'S GOT
CHEWING TOBACCO

16:18.602 --> 16:19.811
IN THAT STORE
OF HIS, AIN'T HE?

16:19.979 --> 16:23.356
- I GUESS.
- AND SOME CIGARS?

16:23.524 --> 16:26.234
YEAH, BUT HE WON'T
LET ME USE THEM.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.735
FORGET THE
OTHER STUFF.

16:27.903 --> 16:29.904
YOU GET US A CHAW,
SOME CIGARS,

16:30.072 --> 16:31.614
AND WE'LL DO
THAT "TOM SAWYER"
FOR YOU.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.659
YEAH, BUT YOU GOT
TO GET THE STUFF
BEFORE THE PLAY,

16:34.827 --> 16:36.285
AND YOU CAN'T
TELL NOBODY.

16:36.453 --> 16:38.621
OKAY, BUT YOU GOT
TO DO AS I SAY.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.623
JUST SO LONG AS YOU
KEEP YOUR BARGAIN.

16:40.791 --> 16:43.084
LET'S HAVE A LOOK
AT THAT BOOK.

16:58.017 --> 16:58.808
HELLO,
MR. MAYFIELD.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.309
- HI, MR. EDWARDS.
- HI, PA.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.520
HOW YOU DOING? ARE
YOU GIRLS REHEARSING
YOUR PLAY TODAY?

17:02.688 --> 17:04.105
WE HAVEN'T EVEN
GOTTEN OUR PARTS YET.

17:04.273 --> 17:06.149
YEAH. WE HAVE TO MEET
WITH MRS. OLESON
AFTER SCHOOL.

17:06.316 --> 17:07.984
OH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A BARREL OF LAUGHS.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.569
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU GIRLS WERE
DOING A PLAY.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.070
- "LITTLE WOMEN."
- "LITTLE WOMEN"?

17:11.238 --> 17:13.322
OH, YEAH. I SEEN ONE
OF THEM IN A SHOW
IN ST. LOUIS.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.116
LITTLE
BITTY DEVIL,
ABOUT THAT TALL.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.826
[LAUGHTER]

17:16.994 --> 17:18.828
NO. THIS IS
DIFFERENT.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.330
IT'S A BOOK.
[GIGGLES]

17:21.498 --> 17:23.166
IT'S DIFFERENT.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.253
SURE WOULD LIKE IT
IF YOU COULD COME,
MR. MAYFIELD.

17:27.421 --> 17:31.007
I'D BE PROUD TO.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOUR
MA'S GOING TO BE THERE.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.343
I DON'T THINK
SO. SHE'S GOT
A LOT TO DO.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.929
YEAH. I RECKON.
DON'T YOU WORRY.
I'LL BE THERE.

17:37.097 --> 17:38.097
[BELL RINGING]

17:38.265 --> 17:39.348
HEY, COME ON.
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

17:39.516 --> 17:40.641
- BYE!
- BYE, MR. MAYFIELD.

17:40.809 --> 17:42.518
BYE-BYE! SEE
YOU AT SUPPER!

17:47.024 --> 17:49.150
THAT LITTLE'UN'S
A LOVELY CHILD.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.402
SPITTING IMAGE
OF HER MA.

17:51.570 --> 17:55.114
THOSE TWO ARE GOING
TO MAKE SOME MAN
A FINE FAMILY.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.240
YOU HEAR THAT,
CHARLES?

17:56.408 --> 17:57.658
I DO BELIEVE THAT'S
THE FIRST TIME

17:57.826 --> 18:00.328
I EVER HEARD A LOVESICK
COYOTE IN THE DAYLIGHT.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.497
HAD KIND OF
THAT RING TO IT,
HAROLD.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.624
YOU BEEN CALLING
ON THE WIDOW CLARK,
HAVE YOU?

18:04.792 --> 18:06.709
UH, NOT SO
YOU'D NOTICE.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.045
SHE JUST DON'T
COTTON TO ME,
I GUESS.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.421
I TRIED EVERYTHING.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.381
Isaiah: WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO?

18:12.549 --> 18:14.258
WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO
IS YOU GOT TO LET HER KNOW

18:14.426 --> 18:15.510
HOW YOU FEEL, YOU SEE?

18:15.677 --> 18:17.512
THEN YOU TELL HER
HOW IT'S GOING TO BE.

18:17.679 --> 18:20.973
I MEAN, THERE AIN'T
A WOMAN NOWHERE THAT DON'T
APPRECIATE A FIRM HAND.

18:21.141 --> 18:22.558
WELL, YOU--
YOU TAKE GRACE.

18:22.726 --> 18:25.019
NOW I--I MEAN,
SHE'D STILL BE PINING
HER NIGHTS AWAY ALONE

18:25.187 --> 18:26.479
IF I HADN'T
SPOKE UP.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.107
YES, SIR. I MEAN,
I TOLD HER HOW
IT WAS GOING TO BE.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.608
I TOLD HER WHAT
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN--

18:30.776 --> 18:33.486
MORNING, GRACE.
ISAIAH WAS JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

18:33.654 --> 18:36.572
WE'LL LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.825
[CHOKING]

18:41.662 --> 18:44.872
UH, UH, GRACE, WE...

18:57.010 --> 18:58.344
THERE.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.764
NOW, UH, MARY,

19:01.932 --> 19:03.933
YOU WILL BE MARMEE,
THE MOTHER.

19:04.101 --> 19:06.102
I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY
NICE PART FOR YOU, DEAR.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.231
- THANK YOU.
- AND, LAURA, YOU BE BETH.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.275
AND, UH, GINNY,

19:12.442 --> 19:15.528
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
MAKE AN EXCELLENT JO.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.821
[CHUCKLES]
YES.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.030
NELLIE, DEAR.

19:18.198 --> 19:19.824
NELLIE IS
GOING TO BE MEG.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.786
I TRIED TO TAILOR
ALL THE PARTS
FOR EACH OF YOU.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.997
NOW, GIRLS,
IF YOU'LL JUST TAKE
THOSE HOME WITH YOU

19:26.165 --> 19:27.415
AND MEMORIZE
THE LINES

19:27.583 --> 19:29.208
SO YOU'LL KNOW THEM FOR
TOMORROW'S REHEARSAL.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.210
THAT WON'T
TAKE LONG.

19:31.378 --> 19:34.922
YES, MA'AM.
WE WILL.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.258
Nellie: OH, AND DON'T
ANY OF YOU BE LATE TOMORROW.

19:37.426 --> 19:42.013
THE MAN'S GOING TO BE
HERE RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL
WITH MY WIG.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.431
A WIG?

19:43.599 --> 19:45.099
YOU'RE GETTING
A WIG, NELLIE?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.642
YES, AND A
PRETTY ONE, TOO.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.145
HE'S GOING TO FIT
IT ON ME AND EVERYTHING.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.147
WHAT DO YOU
NEED A WIG FOR?

19:51.315 --> 19:52.356
WELL, LAURA,

19:52.524 --> 19:55.818
ALL FINE ACTRESSES
NOWADAYS WEAR WIGS,

19:55.986 --> 19:58.446
AND IT IS
NELLIE'S DEBUT.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.739
[CHUCKLES]

19:59.907 --> 20:01.073
CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE IT.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.533
I CAN'T EITHER.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.993
COME ON, LAURA.

20:04.161 --> 20:05.411
Harriet: OH, GIRLS,

20:05.579 --> 20:08.080

STUDY HARD.

20:08.248 --> 20:10.166

WE WILL.

20:15.422 --> 20:17.048
THERE YOU ARE,

20:17.216 --> 20:18.507
THANK YOU--

20:18.675 --> 20:21.260
I DO HOPE I SEE YOU FRIDAY
AT THE SCHOOL ENTERTAINMENT.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.511
OH, YES, I'LL BE THERE.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.722
- GOOD-BYE.
- GOOD-BYE.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.023
WILLIE! WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

20:34.191 --> 20:35.316
I NEED A SAW.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.525
WHAT FOR?

20:36.693 --> 20:37.860
THE PLAY,
"TOM SAWYER."

20:38.028 --> 20:39.987
ALL THE BOYS ARE
GETTING READY
TO PRACTICE.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.114
OH, YOU GOT SOME
BOYS TO DO THE PLAY
WITH YOU, HUH?

20:42.282 --> 20:45.159
YEAH, EVEN SOME
OF THE BIG BOYS
WANT TO PLAY NOW.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.327
IS THAT SO?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.037
WELL, THIS OUGHT
TO DO FINE.

20:48.205 --> 20:49.330
DO YOU NEED A
HAMMER AND NAILS?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.832
- NO, JUST A SAW.
- WELL, DON'T LOSE IT.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.377
I WON'T!

20:54.544 --> 20:57.880
SO THE BIG BOYS, HUH?

20:58.048 --> 21:00.383
Laura: I KNEW
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE
THIS PLAY WITH NELLIE.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.467
Mary: WELL,
IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.052
I SUPPOSE.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.221
BESIDES, THIS WAY,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MEMORIZE
TOO MANY LINES.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.806
I ALREADY KNOW THEM.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.600
"OH, YES,"
AND "OH, MY."

21:09.768 --> 21:10.768
THAT'S IT!

21:10.936 --> 21:12.812
SEE WHAT I MEAN?
YOU KNOW THEM ALREADY.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.313
YEAH.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.068
Laura: THINK I'LL ADD
ONE MORE LINE.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.278

21:20.445 --> 21:21.862
Laura: "SHUT UP, NELLIE."

21:29.871 --> 21:31.330
- HELLO, GIRLS.
- HI, MA.

21:31.498 --> 21:32.581
HOW WAS
SCHOOL TODAY?

21:32.749 --> 21:35.042
ALL RIGHT.
WE GOT OUR PARTS
FOR THE PLAY.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.961
Caroline: YOU DON'T
SOUND VERY EXCITED.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.462
THERE'S NOT MUCH
TO BE EXCITED ABOUT.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.922
NELLIE GOT
ALL THE LINES.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.382
AH, IT CAN'T
BE THAT BAD.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.925
WAIT TILL
YOU READ IT.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.094
ALL I HAVE TO SAY
IS TWO YESES,

21:45.262 --> 21:47.763
"THAT'S RIGHT," AND
"LET MEG TELL YOU."

21:47.931 --> 21:49.473
GUESS WHO PLAYS MEG.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.725
[SIGHS]

21:50.892 --> 21:53.060
WELL, I'M SURE
MRS. OLESON DID HER BEST.

21:53.228 --> 21:55.146
FOR NELLIE,
SHE SURE DID.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.566
Mary: GINNY WENT IN
AND I WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN MRS. OLESON'S OLD PLAY.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.192
OH, DOES GINNY
HAVE A BETTER PART?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.820
NO, JUST THAT SHE'S
EXCITED ABOUT DOING IT

22:02.988 --> 22:04.697
WITH THE PARENTS
COMING AND ALL.

22:04.865 --> 22:08.409
WELL, IT'LL BE
OVER ON FRIDAY.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.037
THAT'S NOT TOO
MUCH TO ENDURE.

22:11.204 --> 22:12.496
I GUESS...

22:12.664 --> 22:16.375
MA, IF THIS IS
WHAT PLAY-ACTING
IS LIKE,

22:16.543 --> 22:19.503
I'M NEVER GOING
TO GO ON STAGE.

ALONGSIDE OF HIM.

22:41.651 --> 22:44.487
"TOM'S MOUTH WATERED
FOR THE APPLE,

22:44.654 --> 22:47.907
"BUT HE STUCK
TO HIS WORK.

22:48.075 --> 22:49.784
HELLO, OLD CHAP."

22:49.951 --> 22:51.035
WILLIE!

22:51.203 --> 22:52.745
YES, PA?

22:55.457 --> 22:56.415
NOTHING.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.542
Willie: "TOM SURVEYED
HIS LAST TOUCH

22:58.710 --> 23:00.795
"WITH THE EYE
OF THE ARTIST.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.005
"THEN HE GAVE
HIS BRUSH

23:03.173 --> 23:05.299
ANOTHER
GENTLE SWEEP."

23:28.698 --> 23:30.741
IF THOSE THERE FLOWERS
ARE FOR GINNY,

23:30.909 --> 23:33.244
SHE'S ALREADY
LEFT FOR SCHOOL.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.088
I DIDN'T PICK THEM
FOR GINNY. I...

23:44.256 --> 23:46.048
I PICKED THEM FOR YOU.

23:46.216 --> 23:48.134
WHATEVER FOR?

23:51.763 --> 23:54.557
A MAN COMES TO CALL,
IT ONLY SEEMS RIGHT.

23:54.724 --> 23:56.100
I DON'T REMEMBER
EVER SAYING ANYTHING

23:56.268 --> 23:59.854
TO GIVE YOU THE IDEA
I WAS RECEIVING
GENTLEMAN CALLERS.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.397
NO, MA'AM, YOU DIDN'T,

24:01.565 --> 24:03.774
BUT I JUST FIGURED
IF I DIDN'T GET IT OUT
PRETTY SOON,

24:03.942 --> 24:05.109
I JUST WOULDN'T
SAY IT AT ALL.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.236
- MR. MAYFIELD--
- JUST--PLEASE.

24:07.404 --> 24:10.281
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO--
TO SAY WHAT'S ON MY MIND.

24:14.035 --> 24:18.164
I MEAN, YOU BEING
SUCH A HANDSOME WOMAN, I...

24:18.331 --> 24:20.833
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT THE LITTLE'UN.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.879
I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

24:25.046 --> 24:26.964
I FEEL AS STRONG
ABOUT YOU.

24:27.132 --> 24:32.011
WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY IS...

24:32.179 --> 24:33.137
IT WOULD DO ME PROUD

24:33.305 --> 24:36.348
IF YOU WOULD JOIN ME,
ACCOMPANY ME T--

24:36.516 --> 24:39.143
WITH GINNY, TO SEE
HER DOINGS AT THE SCHOOL.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.523
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.694
BUT WHY?

24:48.862 --> 24:50.029
BECAUSE
I WON'T BE GOING.

24:50.197 --> 24:53.449
THERE'S PLENTY
TO DO AROUND HERE.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.575
THE LITTLE'UN
WILL BE HEARTBROKE.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.118
WELL,

24:56.286 --> 24:59.121
SHE'S JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE
WITH DISAPPOINTMENT.

24:59.289 --> 25:01.165
I HAVE.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.629
YOUR MAN HAS BEEN GONE
FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS NOW,

25:06.796 --> 25:08.923
AND MOURNING 10 MORE
WON'T BRING HIM BACK.

25:09.090 --> 25:10.132
GIVEN MY CHOICE,

25:10.300 --> 25:11.967
I WOULDN'T
BE MOURNING.

25:12.135 --> 25:13.969
I'D HAVE
GONE WITH HIM.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.974
HE WOULDN'T
HAVE WANTED THAT

25:19.142 --> 25:22.311
ANY MORE THAN MY WOMAN
WOULD HAVE WANTED ME
TO FOLLOW HER 5 YEARS AGO,

25:22.479 --> 25:25.105
AND HE SURE WOULDN'T
WANT YOU HIDING
YOURSELF OUT HERE--

25:25.273 --> 25:28.567
GOOD DAY,
MR. MAYFIELD.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.361
AH, CAN I--PLEASE.
I--LISTEN, I CAME
OUT TO TALK--

25:30.529 --> 25:33.906
GOOD DAY, MR. MAYFIELD.
NOW, WOULD YOU PLEASE GO?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.135
THERE WE ARE,
MY DEAR.

25:55.303 --> 25:57.179
LOOKS AS THOUGH
YOU GREW IT YOURSELF,

25:57.347 --> 25:58.430
IF I DO SAY SO.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.975
- A VERITABLE CLEOPATRA.
- OH.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.726
HERE. HAVE A LOOK
FOR YOURSELF.

26:02.894 --> 26:03.936
IT'S AWFUL
LONG.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.146
WELL,
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE, DEAR.

26:06.314 --> 26:07.940
UH, ISN'T IT,
MR. MASON?

26:08.108 --> 26:09.900
OH, YES.
GIVES IT BODY.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.403
AFTER ALL, THIS IS
THE FINEST HAIR. HA HA.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.405
WOULDN'T WANT
TO WASTE IT ON
A SKIMPY WIG.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.823
Harriet: NO. I'M SURE.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.950
I WANT IT CURLED,
LIKE MY HAIR.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.036
Harriet: YES. YES,
SHE MUST HAVE CURLS.

26:21.204 --> 26:23.038
THAT'S A LOT OF HAIR
TO BE CURLING.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.915
I WANT CURLS.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.876
Man: WELL, I CAN DO THAT,
OF COURSE, BUT THERE
WILL BE AN EXTRA CHARGE.

26:28.044 --> 26:29.211
IT TAKES MOST
OF THE EVENING.

26:29.379 --> 26:33.799
OH. OH, WELL, HOW MUCH
WILL IT BE FOR THE CURLS?

26:33.967 --> 26:35.050
LET'S SEE.

26:35.218 --> 26:38.387
18, 19. CARRY THE 2.

26:38.555 --> 26:41.223
ALL TOLD,
IT COMES TO $27.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.058
$27?

26:43.226 --> 26:44.351
WELL,
FOR GOODNESS' SAKES,

26:44.519 --> 26:47.271
ALL I WANTED
WAS A LITTLE WIG
FOR A PLAY.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.481
MOTHER,
I WANT THIS ONE.

26:49.649 --> 26:52.776
MRS. OLESON, I PAID $18
FOR THE HAIR ALONE.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.987
YOU PAID
SOMEBODY $18,

26:55.155 --> 26:56.405
JUST TO LET YOU
CUT THEIR HAIR?

26:56.573 --> 26:59.033
Man: TRUE, AND THE PRICE
IS GOING UP ALL THE TIME.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.243
AFTER ALL,
OUR PA SAYS

27:01.411 --> 27:03.329
HAIR IS A WOMAN'S
CROWNING GLORY.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.039
AH, THAT IT IS.

27:05.206 --> 27:07.207
THAT'S WHY
A FINE WIG

27:07.375 --> 27:10.210
IS WORTH ITS
WEIGHT IN GOLD.

27:10.378 --> 27:12.004
AH, YES, WELL,

27:12.172 --> 27:14.131
NOW, WE'LL TAKE IT,
BUT IT MUST BE CURLED.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.883
OH, I HAVE
THE CURLING IRON
IN THE WAGON.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.134
IT'LL BE READY
BY MORNING.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.053
Harriet: ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, MR. MASON.

27:19.220 --> 27:20.638
THANK YOU,
MRS. OLESON.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.102
Harriet: ALL RIGHT,
GIRLS, COME ALONG.

27:27.270 --> 27:28.312
LET'S BEGIN OUR REHEARSAL.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.105
DOES EVERYBODY
KNOW HER LINES?

27:30.273 --> 27:32.483
Nellie: I STUDIED MINE
THIS MORNING.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.151
NOW, UH,
MARY,

27:34.319 --> 27:37.279
YOU STAND
RIGHT THERE,

27:37.447 --> 27:38.906
AND, LAURA,

27:39.074 --> 27:40.949
YOU STAND
RIGHT BACK THERE.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.284
DARLING,
GET DOWN HERE.

27:42.452 --> 27:43.452
GINNY.

27:43.620 --> 27:46.246
GINNY,
COME, DARLING.

27:46.414 --> 27:49.958
YOU STAND RIGHT HERE
IN BACK OF NELLIE,

27:50.126 --> 27:52.169
JUST RIGHT
DOWN THERE

27:52.337 --> 27:54.004
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE STAGE
DOWN FRONT.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.547
YES. OH, YES.

27:55.715 --> 27:58.759
OH, THAT'S JUST
EXACTLY HOW I
PICTURED IT. HA!

28:10.480 --> 28:12.564
[SOBBING]

28:21.366 --> 28:24.034
CARRIE?

28:24.202 --> 28:25.619
WHAT'S THE
MATTER, HONEY?

28:25.787 --> 28:29.540
I WANT TO BE
IN THE PLAY WITH
MARY AND LAURA.

28:29.708 --> 28:34.002
OH, WELL, YOU WILL BE
WHEN YOU GET BIGGER.

28:34.170 --> 28:36.296
EVERYBODY ALWAYS
SAYS THAT.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.174
WHAT IF I DON'T
GET BIGGER?

28:39.342 --> 28:42.177
Charles: BUT YOU WILL.

28:42.345 --> 28:45.013
I HOPE SO.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.141
HEY, I TELL YOU WHAT.

28:47.308 --> 28:48.684
YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST AS MUCH FUN

28:48.852 --> 28:51.061
TO GO SEE A PLAY
AS IT IS TO BE IN ONE.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.355
YOU MEAN I CAN GO?

28:53.523 --> 28:54.648
WELL, SURE YOU CAN.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.817
I'M GOING
TO GO TELL MA.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.194
ALL RIGHT.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.865
MA! MA! I'M
GOING TO GO--

29:03.032 --> 29:04.032
[BARKING]

29:04.200 --> 29:06.493
I'LL TELL
YOU LATER!

29:22.552 --> 29:23.886
Ginny: THE PLAY'S
GOING TO BE FUN.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.180
Mary: YEAH. IT SURE IS.

29:26.347 --> 29:28.432
SURE AM GLAD
THAT PLAY'S
TOMORROW.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.101
OTHERWISE, I WOULDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE TO SAY.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.520
SHE TOOK OUT ONE
OF MY YESES AND
MY "THAT'S RIGHT."

29:33.688 --> 29:36.774
WELL, STOP
COMPLAINING. IT'LL
ALL BE OVER SOON.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.902
THAT'S WHAT
DR. BAKER SAID WHEN
HE PULLED MY TOOTH.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.862
IT STILL HURT.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.406
I LIKE THE PLAY.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.409
I JUST WISH
MY MA WAS COMING.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.495
SHE'S NOT
GOING TO BE THERE?

29:49.662 --> 29:50.704
MM-MMM.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.456
WELL, DID SHE
TELL YOU WHY?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.333
SHE GAVE LOTS
OF REASONS.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.752
Mary: MOTHERS DO THAT
WHEN THEY DON'T
WANT YOU TO ARGUE.

29:56.920 --> 29:59.379
THE PROBLEM
IS FINDING OUT
THE REAL REASON.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.800
OUR PA IS GOOD
AT THAT. THEN HE
ARGUES REAL SWEETLY.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.177
ALWAYS GETS
AROUND MA THAT WAY.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.512
DOES IT REALLY WORK?

30:06.679 --> 30:08.806
Mary:
WORKS FOR PA.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.016
I FORGOT SOMETHING.
I HAVE TO GO BACK.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.226
DO YOU WANT US
TO WAIT?

30:12.393 --> 30:15.187
NO. GO ON.
I'LL GET HOME
ALL RIGHT.

30:36.292 --> 30:38.001
Mrs. Clark:
GINNY?

30:38.169 --> 30:39.127
MAMA?

30:39.295 --> 30:40.629
ABOUT TIME
YOU WERE
GETTING HOME.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.797
ALL THIS
PLAY-ACTING

30:41.965 --> 30:44.591
DOESN'T GET
YOUR CHORES
DONE.

30:44.759 --> 30:47.845
WELL, GET
YOUR CHORES--
WHAT IS THIS?

30:48.012 --> 30:49.429
IT'S FOR
YOU, MOM.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.973
WELL, WHAT
IS IT?

30:51.140 --> 30:54.309
A PRESENT.
OPEN IT.

30:54.477 --> 30:58.856
OH...OH, WHERE
DID YOU EVER GET
THIS DRESS?

30:59.023 --> 31:01.942
YOU SAID YOU'D COME
TO THE PLAY IF YOU HAD
A DECENT DRESS TO WEAR,

31:02.110 --> 31:04.152
AND THIS WAS
THE PRETTIEST
MR. OLESON HAD.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.238
BUT WHERE DID YOU
GET THE MONEY FOR IT?

31:06.406 --> 31:08.240
IT'S A SECRET.

31:08.408 --> 31:10.325
GINNY.

31:12.078 --> 31:14.079
IT WAS THAT MR. MAYFIELD,
WASN'T IT?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.290
WELL, YOU CAN JUST
TAKE THIS DRESS BACK
TO MR. OLESON,

31:16.457 --> 31:18.292
AND YOU CAN TAKE
THAT MONEY BACK
TO MR. MAYFIELD.

31:18.459 --> 31:19.501
IT WASN'T
MR. MAYFIELD--

31:19.669 --> 31:20.836
NOW, DON'T YOU
LIE TO ME.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.129
YOU HAD NO MONEY.

31:22.297 --> 31:23.338
BUT I DID.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.090
NOW, NOT
ANOTHER WORD.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.050
NOW, YOU WILL
GO TO YOUR ROOM
WITHOUT YOUR SUPPER,

31:27.218 --> 31:29.761
AND FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING, YOU'LL TAKE
THIS BACK WHERE IT BELONGS,

31:29.929 --> 31:31.221
AND YOU CAN TELL
THAT MR. MAYFIELD

31:31.389 --> 31:34.266
THAT WE DON'T
APPRECIATE HIS TRICKS.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.935
NOW, GO DO
AS YOU'RE TOLD.

32:13.556 --> 32:15.724
CAROLINE!

32:15.892 --> 32:16.892
HI, DARLING.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.060
HI.

32:18.227 --> 32:19.853
I THOUGHT YOU
JUST SCRUBBED
THIS FLOOR.

32:20.021 --> 32:24.232
I JUST WANTED
TO WET-MOP IT,
BUT I CAN'T FIND THE MOP.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.400
LAURA!

32:25.568 --> 32:27.903
Laura: YES, MA?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.780
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE MOP?

32:29.948 --> 32:31.573
Laura: THE MOP?

32:31.741 --> 32:32.741
YES, THE MOP.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.034
Laura: THE NEW MOP?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.370
YES,
THE NEW MOP.

32:36.537 --> 32:39.456
Laura: WELL, I...

32:39.624 --> 32:41.750
- LAURA.
- YES, SIR?

32:41.918 --> 32:43.543
WOULD YOU COME
TO THE STAIRS,
PLEASE, DEAR?

32:43.711 --> 32:45.504
Laura: RIGHT NOW?

32:45.672 --> 32:47.839
RIGHT NOW.

32:52.345 --> 32:53.929
HA HA!

32:54.097 --> 32:55.806
WELL, I CAN SEE THAT
YOU FOUND THE MOP.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.350
NOW, WHY DO YOU
HAVE IT ON YOUR HEAD?

32:58.518 --> 33:00.644
WELL...

33:00.812 --> 33:03.772
NELLIE GETS TO WEAR
A WIG IN THE PLAY.

33:03.940 --> 33:05.774
I WAS JUST SEEING
HOW IT LOOKS.

33:05.942 --> 33:09.111
WELL, YOU LOOK MORE
LIKE MEDUSA THAN
YOU DO LIKE BETH.

33:09.278 --> 33:10.779
WHO'S MEDUSA?

33:10.947 --> 33:11.822
Charles: NEVER MIND
WHO MEDUSA IS.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.323
JUST GET THE MOP
OFF YOUR HEAD

33:13.491 --> 33:15.701
AND BACK ON THE MOP
HANDLE WHERE IT BELONGS,
ALL RIGHT?

33:15.868 --> 33:18.328
YES, SIR.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.007
GEE WHIZ.

33:30.174 --> 33:32.634
NELLIE'S GOT
ALL THE LINES.

33:32.802 --> 33:35.470
AND NOW SHE'S GOT
ALL THE HAIR.

34:12.675 --> 34:14.092
HEY, THERE,
LITTLE'UN.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.928
YOU LIKE A LIFT
INTO TOWN?

34:17.096 --> 34:19.765
I AIN'T
GOING TO TOWN.

34:33.029 --> 34:36.239
WELL, FOR SOMEONE
WHO'S NOT HEADING ANYWHERE,
YOU'RE UP AWFUL EARLY.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.825
MOST FOLKS
AIN'T EVEN HAD
THEIR BREAKFAST YET.

34:38.993 --> 34:41.078
I WASN'T HUNGRY.

34:41.245 --> 34:44.790
WELL, NOW,
THAT IS AWFUL
SERIOUS.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.292
OF COURSE,
I HEARD ACTOR PEOPLE

34:47.460 --> 34:49.669
THAT DON'T EAT MUCH
BEFORE THEY DO A SHOW.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.172
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
IN THE SHOW.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.174
WELL, WHY NOT,
LITTLE'UN?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.718
BECAUSE MAMA'S
NOT GOING TO COME.

34:56.886 --> 34:59.805
I BEGGED HER,
MR. MAYFIELD.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.598
SHE JUST
DOESN'T CARE.

35:01.766 --> 35:04.017
YOUR MAMA'S HARD
TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETIMES,

35:04.185 --> 35:05.560
BUT SHE DOES
CARE FOR YOU.

35:05.728 --> 35:09.189
NO, SHE DOESN'T.

A DRESS.

TO TAKE IT BACK.

IN THIS PACKAGE?

ME. SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS FROM YOU.

WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

THAT SHE--

I SAID EVERYTHING
I HAD TO SAY.

MRS. CLARK.

TO DO WITH ME.

IT HAS TO DO
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

IS ANY CONCERN OF YOURS.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.273

THIS MORNING?

NO. SHE WAS GONE
BEFORE I CAME BACK
FROM DOING THE MILKING.

WHERE SHE GOT
THE MONEY, TOO, MR.--

A LOT MORE THAN

FOUND A LITTLE GIRL

THE BIGGEST DAY
OF HER LIFE,

TELL THE DIFFERENCE

PITY FOR HERSELF
