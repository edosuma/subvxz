WEBVTT

00:58.683 --> 01:00.014
Brothers and sisters!

01:03.855 --> 01:05.846
The times we 're going through

01:05.857 --> 01:06.972
The times we 're going through

01:08.943 --> 01:10.399
are challenging us.

01:12.113 --> 01:14.274
They let us doubt our faith.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.694
And they question our trust in God.

01:18.995 --> 01:21.407
Where is our Lord?

01:21.623 --> 01:22.783
Is He protecting us?

01:23.875 --> 01:25.240
Does He see What's happening?

01:26.169 --> 01:27.784
Even I wondered:

01:28.671 --> 01:30.662
"What kind of a god is He
for putting us on a test like this?"

01:30.673 --> 01:32.004
"What kind of a god is He
for putting us on a test like this?"

01:32.592 --> 01:35.459
But then I thought about it

01:36.304 --> 01:38.295
and I realized that the answer lies

01:38.306 --> 01:39.546
and I realized that the answer lies

01:39.766 --> 01:41.802
Within the question itself.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.265
The god / believe in,

01:48.441 --> 01:50.227
the god as / know him,

01:51.820 --> 01:53.606
wouldn't allow anything
like this to happen.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.948
This is not our god!

01:56.324 --> 01:57.780
Amen.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.399
This thing,

01:59.619 --> 02:01.405
this evil that happened to us

02:03.581 --> 02:05.321
wants us to turn our back on Him.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.412
We shall lose our faith.

02:13.550 --> 02:16.041
It’s nourished by your doubts.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.921
Don 't allow this to happen.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.304
Don 't stir up this doubts.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.056
Don 't fade into perdition.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.689
We resist evil by taking up the ﬁght.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.031
We resist evil by taking up the ﬁght.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.318
We ﬁght it by surviving.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.088
Stop! Padre, stop.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.680
Stop! Padre, stop.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.144
We are left no choice.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.553
You're fighting death with death.
That's madness.

03:09.647 --> 03:12.639
You are a good
person, Tom Abigail.

03:12.734 --> 03:14.224
Do not protect her.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.731
I'm protecting you from
those who work for me.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.812
They know you are coming and they are
armed far, far greater than you.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.983
They know you are coming and they are
armed far, far greater than you.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.024
You'll be dead by the
time you get to the gate.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.445
You'll be dead by the
time you get to the gate.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.735
What is it?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.488
What is happening here?

03:30.418 --> 03:31.999
What does that mean?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.372
They are sick!

03:33.588 --> 03:34.668
What is happening here?

03:37.800 --> 03:39.176
They bleed!

03:43.181 --> 03:44.170
Oh my god!

03:48.978 --> 03:50.809
See the evil you protect?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.888
Celia, this was her.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.140
Celia, this was her.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.184
No! No!

03:57.195 --> 03:59.151
No! No!

04:30.603 --> 04:32.594
Nobody will look at me.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.981
Nobody will look at me.

04:34.565 --> 04:37.352
Tell me what happened.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.399
I didn't do anything wrong.

04:40.905 --> 04:42.315
Why are they so mad at me?

04:42.407 --> 04:44.398
They're saying

04:44.409 --> 04:46.115
They're saying

04:46.160 --> 04:48.572
that guy you shot

04:48.663 --> 04:50.369
wasn't sick.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.115
Who said that?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.331
Who said he wasn't sick?

04:59.799 --> 05:02.461
- Madison?
- She's worried about you.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.007
She said she believed me, Dad.

05:08.766 --> 05:10.142
Come here.

05:14.772 --> 05:17.639
- How's this gonna go?
- Luis will take the Zodiac over

05:17.734 --> 05:20.726
- to the boat up ahead of us
where his contact...- Miguel.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.731
...Migue| will accept payment

05:22.822 --> 05:25.359
and then we'll be on our
way to beautiful Baja.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.782
Okay, stop. Stop here.
That's close enough.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.282
Good luck.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.499
How do you say
"asshole" in Spanish?

05:37.587 --> 05:39.794
You don't. You grin and bear it.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.880
No, no. Luis,
get back up here.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.052
- What's going on?
- Why are they coming towards us?

05:48.097 --> 05:50.053
What do you mean, they?

05:50.099 --> 05:52.715
There are two of them. Tell
me one of them is Miguel.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.766
Yeah, the one at the wheel is.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.219
The other guy I don't know.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.853
Madison, get everyone
down below deck.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.601
You need to hide.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.432
Luis, give me your gun.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.984
We have a problem.
Engine room, now.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.403
- What's going on?
- Where's Nick?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.572
- He went down below.
- Come inside.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.649
- Can it wait?
- No, it can't. Company's on the way.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.196
- Can it wait?
- No, it can't. Company's on the way.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.531
- Nick!
- Are we there yet?

06:13.623 --> 06:15.079
- Not even close. Come on.
- What's wrong?

06:15.124 --> 06:16.705
We have to hide.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.332
One of them is saying
they like the boat.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.549
One of them is saying
they like the boat.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.922
He's impressed by
Strand's wealth

06:29.013 --> 06:30.878
and wants to know
how much it cost.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.633
And Strand says he'd prefer
not to discuss money.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.225
And Strand says he'd prefer
not to discuss money.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.137
Careful, Victor.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.647
Let's talk about gold,
then, shall we?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.769
Two bars, one per head.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.523
Luis is making the payment.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.654
Just take it and go.
Take it and go.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.326
Now he's saying it's a big
vessel for two people.

07:01.337 --> 07:02.497
Now he's saying it's a big
vessel for two people.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.965
Oh, come on.

07:05.049 --> 07:07.631
He wants to make sure there
are no infected on board.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.546
What's going on, Luis?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.757
-They have the gold.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.138
- Wait.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.977
- Drop it!
- Easy.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.474
Which side are you on?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.006
What the hell happened?

07:46.090 --> 07:47.876
Someone said "asshole"
in Spanish.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.709
- Luis?
- Slow down!

07:55.808 --> 07:58.220
We just want to negotiate.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.353
Everyone stay inside.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.752
- Please, don 't.
- I'm sorry.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.709
- Please, not in the head.
- l have no choice.

08:34.138 --> 08:36.595
Please, don 't!

08:36.682 --> 08:38.798
- Wait, wait.
- Get back inside!

08:38.893 --> 08:40.849
It's okay. Shh. Shh.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.973
Let me help you.
Let me help you.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.475
Give that to my mother! I beg you.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.192
Give that to my mother! I beg you.

08:50.279 --> 08:52.110
What is it?

08:52.198 --> 08:54.063
- It is nothing.
- Whoa, whoa! No, don't!

08:59.497 --> 09:01.362
Let him be.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.802
My mother...

09:29.819 --> 09:32.481
They stopped shooting.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.317
They think whatever is
on land will kill us.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.374
I'm fine.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.134
- Strand, how much further?
- We're close now.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.333
Thomas!

10:37.470 --> 10:39.085
- Thomas!
- Victor.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.595
Thomas.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.398
Hey!

11:10.836 --> 11:12.042
Oh, no.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.728
Chris!

12:28.914 --> 12:31.326
We have to go, now!

12:39.800 --> 12:41.711
Nick. Nick!

13:19.548 --> 13:21.379
Oh, my God.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.805
Shut up.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.905
- Bienvenidos.
- Welcome.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.910
Celia, tell me he's here.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.162
Come.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.911
- Luis?
- Welcome.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.996
My name is Soﬁa.
Nice to meet you all.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.794
Military. We had to
fight to get through.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.047
He's one of them now.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.131
Then he'll find his way back.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.216
-Hi, I'm Madison.
-Hola.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.558
-Hi, I'm Madison.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.595
Hello. Juan!
Come and welcome our guests.

Come and welcome our guests.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.729
-Hola.
-Hola.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.736
Now if you'll follow me, I can
give you a tour of the house.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.737
But first l have to ask
you for your weapons.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.610
Thank you.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.957
Why?

16:06.090 --> 16:07.705
They don 't need 'em here.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.840
Weapons are always useful.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.053
Then you can keep 'em.

16:15.724 --> 16:16.975
Thank you.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.595
But leave 'em outside.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.262
Rules of the house.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.516
Papa.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.350
We're guests here.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.537
Thanks.

16:53.762 --> 16:54.877
How is he?

16:55.097 --> 16:56.132
He '8 really calm.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.177
- Thanks, Jorge.
- You're welcome.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.147
Better late than never.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.715
I'm sorry.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.014
It's okay.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.465
I waited for you.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.149
You mind giving us
a minute, please?

17:56.825 --> 17:58.816
Of course,mijo.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.327
If I'd only been here in time.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.283
I could've done something.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.374
You're here now.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.091
Shall I help you into bed?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.218
Shall I help you into bed?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.849
Mm.

18:40.452 --> 18:42.283
lgotyou.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.282
Come on.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.369
...a devil.
Look, you're not being diplomatic at all.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.245
...a devil.
Look, you're not being diplomatic at all.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.171
I think I've run
into a contact here.

18:55.259 --> 18:57.250
Certainly run into something,
that's for sure.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.984
I don't know.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.361
It's old. It's recorded.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.575
Here.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.775
Are you mad at me?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.165
I saw what you did.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.075
What are you talking about?

19:33.839 --> 19:35.079
Come on, Chris.

19:35.132 --> 19:36.668
Whatever you think you saw--

19:36.758 --> 19:39.625
I know what I saw.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.836
Chris, you were watching.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.673
They were gonna kill her
and you were watching.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.679
- No, I swear. - You were gonna
stand there and let it happen.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.056
I would never do that, Alicia.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.472
I would never do that.
Why-- why--

19:53.567 --> 19:55.808
why would I ever do that?

19:55.903 --> 19:57.894
I don't know, but I'm not gonna
pretend like it didn't happen.

19:57.946 --> 19:59.811
You can't tell anyone, Alicia.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.738
Please, don't.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.737
You can't tell anyone. Don't.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.739
- She's my mom.
- And she's like my mom, too.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.741
If you tell everybody this
lie, what'll happen to us?

20:08.832 --> 20:10.914
What'll happen to our family?
You'll blow everything up

20:10.959 --> 20:12.915
- based off something you think you saw.
- Let me by, Chris.

20:12.961 --> 20:14.917
Whatever you think you
saw, it's wrong, Alicia.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.295
| froze. That's it. That's
all that happened, okay?

20:17.382 --> 20:20.169
- Chris, let me go.
- You have to believe me.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.507
You can't say anything.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.631
What if I do?

20:31.939 --> 20:33.804
I don't want to hurt anyone.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.331
- Hello.
- Hello, young man.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.462
Celia?

20:59.549 --> 21:01.414
/ am Nick.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.047
- Ah, Nicholas.
- Yes.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.504
A beautiful name for a beautiful boy.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.382
Scusi, I don't speak Spanish.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.467
- Are you hungry, Nicholas?
- I'm very hungry, yeah.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.093
- Are you hungry, Nicholas?
- I'm very hungry, yeah.

21:13.146 --> 21:16.104
What are we going to do?
Dinner's not till 8:00.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.184
If I give you some pozole, you
promise not to tell the others?

21:20.195 --> 21:21.696
If I give you some pozole, you
promise not to tell the others?

21:21.780 --> 21:23.771
I would do just about
anything for some pozole.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.443
I would do just about
anything for some pozole.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.365
- Sit.
-Thank you very much.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.797
Thank you.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.759
- How is it?
- It's amazing.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.307
Luis...

21:58.358 --> 22:00.770
he was asking for you

22:00.861 --> 22:02.897
when he--

22:02.988 --> 22:04.979
you were on his mind.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.651
you were on his mind.

22:06.742 --> 22:09.654
He wanted me to tell you that.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.406
Thank you.

22:14.249 --> 22:16.240
You have a heavy smile. Why?

22:16.251 --> 22:17.286
You have a heavy smile. Why?

22:26.261 --> 22:28.718
I'm just a bit sick of it.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.721
Of what?

22:33.477 --> 22:35.513
Of all the killing.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.360
What?

22:46.406 --> 22:49.193
None of this is new, Nicholas.

22:49.242 --> 22:51.619
We are just visitors.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.694
Our dead, and they are our dead,

22:53.705 --> 22:56.287
Our dead, and they are our dead,

22:56.333 --> 22:58.324
they have always
walked amongst us.

22:58.335 --> 22:59.415
they have always
walked amongst us.

22:59.503 --> 23:02.165
The only difference is
now we can see them.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.455
It's a pretty big difference.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.170
- Mom.
- Shower's all yours, son.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.336
Okay, in a minute.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.721
I don't know how much hot water is
left and | smell you from here.

23:12.808 --> 23:15.720
Okay, I'm coming.
Graciasfor the pozole.

23:15.811 --> 23:16.766
You were not supposed to tell.

23:16.853 --> 23:18.639
Mmm.

23:23.527 --> 23:25.108
He's special, your son.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.360
He's impressionable.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.192
The enlightened always are.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.323
He's fragile.

23:35.372 --> 23:37.283
Thank you for your hospitality.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.123
Of course.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.853
Do you pray?

24:06.153 --> 24:07.108
No.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.363
- May /?
- Of course.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.662
My condolences.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.160
Why?

24:22.461 --> 24:24.497
He wasn't shot in the head.

24:26.339 --> 24:27.795
Was he?

24:30.844 --> 24:31.754
No.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.677
Then there '8 no need for condolences.

24:52.157 --> 24:53.522
-/t's Madison.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.566
Do we like her?

24:57.329 --> 24:58.910
She's fierce.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.454
- Come on in.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.744
I didn't know if either of
you were feeling up to it.

25:06.755 --> 25:07.835
I didn't know if either of
you were feeling up to it.

25:07.923 --> 25:10.665
It was a lovely thought.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.507
I'm Madison.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.262
Tom.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.759
It's nice to meet you, Tom.

25:21.853 --> 25:23.844
Sorry I haven't been out of bed.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.356
Sorry I haven't been out of bed.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.980
Under normal circumstances,

25:28.068 --> 25:30.775
I'm a much better host.

25:30.862 --> 25:33.569
Under normal circumstances, I'm
a much less intrusive guest.

25:33.615 --> 25:35.606
Come on now, Madison. You and
I both know that is not true.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.857
Come on now, Madison. You and
I both know that is not true.

25:40.789 --> 25:42.450
Tom.

25:42.499 --> 25:44.615
-l'm okay.
-You sure?

25:44.709 --> 25:46.700
- I should go.
- Wait.

25:46.711 --> 25:47.917
- I should go.
- Wait.

25:49.464 --> 25:50.795
Will you promise me something?

25:52.008 --> 25:54.385
Tell me what it is.

25:54.427 --> 25:56.418
Will you look after
him when I'm gone?

25:56.429 --> 25:57.839
Will you look after
him when I'm gone?

26:02.477 --> 26:04.433
Must we be so maudlin?

26:06.731 --> 26:08.016
He won't make it easy.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.474
Why do you think I'm asking you?

26:17.951 --> 26:19.691
Papa. I've been calling you.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.866
Papa?

26:27.210 --> 26:29.622
Everybody started
eating already.

26:31.298 --> 26:32.913
I'm not hungry.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.879
Celia's an amazing cook.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.427
Your mother...

26:39.472 --> 26:41.463
she was an amazing cook.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.759
she was an amazing cook.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.310
Yeah.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.233
Papa, is everything okay?

26:57.324 --> 26:59.406
Yes.

27:01.202 --> 27:03.693
- So you're hungry?
- Yeah.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.653
That's very good.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.081
It means the infection is gone.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.585
What do you want
me to tell them?

27:19.804 --> 27:21.795
Tell them I'm tired.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.012
Tell them I'm tired.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.717
Okay.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.828
Alicia.

27:50.919 --> 27:53.706
- Hey, Mom.
- Aren't you gonna go to sleep?

27:53.755 --> 27:55.711
Yeah, I'm just--

27:59.010 --> 28:01.001
it's kind of pathetic
how much I miss TV.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.388
it's kind of pathetic
how much I miss TV.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.421
When you were a little girl and your dad
and I would leave you with a sitter,

28:04.432 --> 28:06.468
When you were a little girl and your dad
and I would leave you with a sitter,

28:06.518 --> 28:08.679
when we'd come home, that's
exactly how we'd find you--

28:08.728 --> 28:11.561
in front of the television
fighting to stay awake.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.143
Barely keep your eyes open.

28:16.111 --> 28:18.102
l was always afraid you
wouldn't come back.

28:18.113 --> 28:19.398
l was always afraid you
wouldn't come back.

28:23.201 --> 28:25.613
What are you afraid of now?

28:31.960 --> 28:33.951
- Travis, we need to talk.
- What's wrong?

28:33.962 --> 28:35.042
- Travis, we need to talk.
- What's wrong?

28:35.130 --> 28:37.121
Back on the boat today, what was the
nature of your conversation with Chris?

28:37.132 --> 28:38.497
Back on the boat today, what was the
nature of your conversation with Chris?

28:38.550 --> 28:40.336
The nature of our conversation?
What?

28:40.427 --> 28:42.634
- Please, come on.
- Chris thought he was a threat.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.590
- That he was gonna turn.
- And that's it?

28:44.639 --> 28:47.051
Yeah, that's it. Come
on, what's wrong?

28:47.142 --> 28:49.303
Chris threatened Alicia today.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.635
- What do you mean threatened?
- She thought he was gonna hurt her.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.724
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- No, Travis, listen to--

28:53.773 --> 28:55.309
No, that makes zero
goddamn sense.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.186
Why? Why would he do that?

28:57.277 --> 28:59.233
I almost died back
at the church.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.106
- What?
- Chris didn't help.

29:01.197 --> 29:03.859
He could have and he
didn't and Alicia saw him.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.066
She saw him just watching.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.243
So you're saying he
wants you both dead?

29:08.329 --> 29:09.785
I think he's sick.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.038
No, you're saying my son
wants you both dead.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.865
- Are you hearing yourself?
- He needs help.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.746
So let's help him. Let's help
him like we helped Nick.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.706
- That's not the same.
- It's exactly the same.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.838
When Nick was at his worst,
I was there for you.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.915
Have you forgotten? Every
time he disappeared.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.126
Every time, every
search, every rehab.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.960
Who was there for him?

29:26.055 --> 29:28.262
Come on, who went out
there and found him?

29:28.349 --> 29:30.180
Yeah, that's right.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.304
I believed he could get better.

29:32.395 --> 29:34.807
I believed in him because
I believed in you.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.221
It's not about Nick.

29:36.316 --> 29:38.807
Okay, sure. So all right.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.896
What if you're right?

29:40.987 --> 29:43.603
What if there's something
wrong with Chris?

29:43.656 --> 29:45.237
Help me. Help me to help him.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.156
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

29:47.243 --> 29:48.858
But he threatened my daughter.

29:48.953 --> 29:51.490
Our daughter. Maddy, come on.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.530
The whole way here, all
I've heard from you

29:53.583 --> 29:56.165
is I need you with me, we
need to be a united front.

29:56.252 --> 29:58.243
Well, I need you now, Maddy.

29:58.254 --> 29:59.369
Well, I need you now, Maddy.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.206
Where are you?

30:08.681 --> 30:10.217
Alicia needs me
with her tonight.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.885
Be with her. I'll go to Chris.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.602
Be with her. I'll go to Chris.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.702
Can we maybe lose the sheet?

30:35.416 --> 30:37.828
Of course.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.664
Is that better?

30:52.934 --> 30:55.095
Go to sleep now.

30:56.271 --> 30:58.262
I can't.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.932
I'm begging you.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.017
This world was never
good enough for you.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.188
This world was never
good enough for you.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.610
Let it go.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.825
I don't want to leave you.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.415
What if you don't have to?

31:32.015 --> 31:34.097
I could go with you.

31:34.183 --> 31:36.640
Are you...?

31:38.980 --> 31:41.892
How very Shakespearean of you.

31:43.818 --> 31:46.355
Shut up, Thomas, before
I change my mind.

31:48.072 --> 31:50.734
lcantletyou.

31:50.783 --> 31:52.489
Why not?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.693
There's nothing left for
me here once you've gone.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.531
How would it work?

32:01.127 --> 32:03.914
Celia will watch over us.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.124
You know she will.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.955
But how will you--

32:08.051 --> 32:10.793
You let me worry about that.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.565
What the hell...

32:37.288 --> 32:38.403
Where are you taking me?

32:38.498 --> 32:40.534
What, you don't trust me?

32:45.838 --> 32:47.829
Should have known.
Should have known.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.920
Should have known.
Should have known.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.458
When a woman says, "Come with
me" and she doesn't tell you

32:51.552 --> 32:54.009
where you're going, she's
taking you to Jesus.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.011
It's always Jesus.

32:56.099 --> 32:58.511
Nick, I need to
talk to my mother.

33:01.562 --> 33:03.518
Okay.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.550
When was the last time you
were inside a church?

33:35.555 --> 33:38.342
Can't remember. Go
on, do your thing.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.509
Mama, it's me.

33:42.520 --> 33:43.555
Mama, it's me.

33:45.773 --> 33:48.640
I'm worried about Papa.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.817
He's lost his way without you.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.773
I don't know if you
could see him.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.234
Maybe you could see him.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.315
He's just so frail.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.611
He's just so frail.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.694
Can't even stay angry
at him anymore.

34:00.705 --> 34:01.911
Can't even stay angry
at him anymore.

34:04.459 --> 34:06.791
If you were here,

34:06.836 --> 34:09.452
/ know you'd know
exactly what to do.

34:13.718 --> 34:15.834
/ don 't know what to do.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.878
He's such a hard man
to take care of.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.675
He's such a hard man
to take care of.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.882
How did you do it for so long?

34:27.899 --> 34:30.060
I miss you.

34:30.109 --> 34:32.065
/ miss you every day.

34:32.111 --> 34:33.897
Gloria?

34:41.996 --> 34:44.282
No. No. No.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.499
I'll come back tomorrow.
I promise.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.670
I'll come back tomorrow.
I promise.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.010
l/ove you.

35:05.019 --> 35:06.680
Thank you...

35:06.771 --> 35:09.478
for doing this with me.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.602
The man who lives here is sick.
Like you were.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.319
The man who lives here is sick.
Like you were.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.360
The grown ups act weird...

35:20.451 --> 35:22.442
/ keep distance and stay alone.

35:22.453 --> 35:23.533
/ keep distance and stay alone.

35:23.746 --> 35:26.123
l was practicing
some tricks with my ball.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.412
I'm getting better and better.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.162
Today I juggled the ball 45 times.

35:35.174 --> 35:37.711
To bad that there's nobody
who's playing with me.

35:37.927 --> 35:38.916
Whom are you talking to?

35:41.806 --> 35:44.013
You can tell me.

35:45.810 --> 35:47.175
With my mom.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.018
Is she in there?

35:49.230 --> 35:50.345
Yes.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.268
Will you introduce me to her?

35:54.819 --> 35:56.650
You can look through the grids.

36:31.397 --> 36:32.807
I just come from the basement.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.353
Are you responsible for this?

36:39.071 --> 36:40.322
They're part of the family.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.111
They are children,

36:44.327 --> 36:46.318
husbands, wives, fathers and mothers

36:46.329 --> 36:47.535
husbands, wives, fathers and mothers

36:48.372 --> 36:51.079
of people who have worked here
over the years.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.041
I'd rather die

36:54.253 --> 36:56.460
than leaving 'em here unprotected.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.087
They weren't safe outside.

37:00.259 --> 37:01.465
They were hunted.

37:02.637 --> 37:03.843
As if they were monsters.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.175
The parishioners?

37:17.526 --> 37:18.936
They poisoned them.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.737
They killed 'em all.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.736
No.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.363
You killed them.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.570
You brought death in this house
and endanger all of us.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.082
You brought death in this house
and endanger all of us.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.123
Why are you so afraid of dying?

37:36.003 --> 37:37.743
Why are you such a tortured soul?

37:40.883 --> 37:42.874
Make peace with your dead,
old man.

37:42.885 --> 37:44.421
Make peace with your dead,
old man.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.466
What are you afraid of?

38:45.698 --> 38:46.983
That was lovely.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.655
When Thomas was a little boy,

38:52.747 --> 38:55.284
he was so afraid of the dark.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.324
The only way he could
sleep was if I sang.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.415
The only way he could
sleep was if I sang.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.493
It had to be that song.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.880
It had to be that song.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.875
Nothing else worked.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.251
A creature of habit
from the start.

39:20.274 --> 39:22.731
I never thought you were
good enough for him.

39:22.818 --> 39:25.070
I'm aware.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.315
It is a brave and beautiful
thing you have decided to do.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.618
I want you to know
how proud I am.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.156
l was wrong about you.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.042
How long will it take?

39:50.096 --> 39:52.303
Not long.

39:59.522 --> 40:01.012
Now sleep, my dear.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.592
Celia.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.641
- You have returned to me.
- Yeah.

40:38.727 --> 40:41.434
Does your mother know?

40:41.480 --> 40:43.391
She's sleeping.

40:44.650 --> 40:47.392
She worries about you.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.561
I've given her reason to.

41:01.625 --> 41:04.082
What is it you want to know?

41:04.170 --> 41:06.161
They're not really dead,

41:06.172 --> 41:08.413
They're not really dead,

41:08.466 --> 41:11.128
are they?

41:15.973 --> 41:18.510
No, they are not, Nicholas.

41:18.601 --> 41:21.092
So what are they?

41:25.774 --> 41:27.901
They are what comes next.

43:30.399 --> 43:31.855
Alicia.

43:53.172 --> 43:54.378
What the hell are you doing?

43:55.883 --> 43:58.340
Chris, get out!

43:58.385 --> 43:59.921
Get out!
