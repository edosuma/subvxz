WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:01.918
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:01.918 --> 00:05.130
I know you're in there,
Yavalla.

00:05.171 --> 00:06.798
Go to hell!

00:06.840 --> 00:09.968
- The Queen is dead.
- Do it, now!

00:10.010 --> 00:12.053
Talon!

00:12.095 --> 00:14.389
You wouldn't have needed me
if you hadn't brought
the white kinj

00:14.431 --> 00:18.184
- from the Plane of Ashes.
- We didn't bring it from
the Plane of Ashes.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.394
I remember you from the road.

00:19.436 --> 00:21.354
Just call me pointy-eared scum.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.652
Your kinj doesn't work on me.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.197
This will always be
our Outpost!

00:31.239 --> 00:33.074
( cheering )

00:36.828 --> 00:39.581
( music playing )

00:39.622 --> 00:43.376
Enjoy it whilst you can.
We're running out of grain
to make the ale.

00:43.418 --> 00:47.297
Thank you, Janzo.
All we need are a few gulps.

00:47.338 --> 00:50.800
- Welcome home.
- And to Talon and you, Garret,

00:50.842 --> 00:54.054
for rescuing Tobin and I
and getting those things
out of our heads.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.222
If you will excuse me,
I must get back
to finding a way

00:56.264 --> 00:58.433
to getting those things
out of other people's heads.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.393
Can't very well just kill
everyone in the Realm

01:00.435 --> 01:05.356
and then expect Two to
bring them back to life,
can we? Can we?

01:05.398 --> 01:08.693
So tell me everything
that happened whilst both
Tobin and I were gone.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.322
Falista. Mr. Tobin.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.201
What happened before you left?
Ahem, Tobin.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.621
So glad you made it back
unharmed, Tobin.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.628
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:26.669 --> 01:28.296
Your Majesty.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.673
So wonderful
to finally meet you.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.051
I'm your humble servant,
Falista of Relman.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.095
Or, well, now of Aegisford.

01:35.136 --> 01:39.516
I've heard so much about you
from Lord Tobin.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.645
My husband.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.822
( theme music playing )

02:11.089 --> 02:12.882
Are they done celebrating
up there yet?

02:12.924 --> 02:15.343
They're just having one drink,
Wren. They deserve that much.

02:15.385 --> 02:16.845
Not sure what they even
have to celebrate.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.721
It's not as if anyone's
solved anything.

02:18.763 --> 02:21.307
- They got the Queen back.
- Mm-hmm. For now.

02:21.349 --> 02:24.102
Right, so, uh, any progress?

02:24.144 --> 02:28.481
None. Luring the kinj out,
cutting it out, burning it out,
poisoning it out.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.108
Last night I was humming
a tune to myself,

02:30.150 --> 02:31.317
thought I saw
the kinj glowing,

02:31.359 --> 02:34.863
so I even tried
singing it out.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.782
How cruel.
You killed a rat
with your singing?

02:37.824 --> 02:39.117
Not funny.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.372
Wren, are you angry with me
for something?

02:44.414 --> 02:47.167
- No, why?
- Just seemed like you are.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.585
No, I'm just focused
on the work, that's all.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.920
Are you implying that I'm not?

02:50.962 --> 02:52.839
- I'm not the one
who's up there celebrating.
- Wren, they're my friends.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.300
Janzo, it's just that if we
don't find a way to stop
this thing soon,

02:55.341 --> 02:58.136
your friends are going off to
try and kill my mother again.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.139
- So...
- Did they say that?

03:01.181 --> 03:05.351
No.
What other choice do they have
unless we stop them first?

03:05.393 --> 03:07.979
Well, then let's get to it,
shall we?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.689
Every riddle has an answer,
doesn't it, eh?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.944
This meld box,
we've gone over it with
a fine-toothed comb, yes?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.696
Mm-hmm. Every speck.
It's no help.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.365
That means we have tried
every poison,

03:19.407 --> 03:22.327
anything that is harmful or--
or deadly to us.

03:22.368 --> 03:26.289
What if we've been looking
in the wrong place?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.374
- What do you mean?
- Maybe we stop looking
at the poisons

03:28.416 --> 03:31.252
and only try elements
that are harmless to people.

03:31.294 --> 03:33.880
- You mean everything?
- Except poisons.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.549
I don't even know
where to start.

03:36.591 --> 03:40.720
Trial and error.
We can use this chart as a way
to mark things off as we go.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.767
Wren, don't worry.

03:45.808 --> 03:49.020
We'll crack this.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.481
Why didn't you tell me, Tobin?
I feel like such a fool.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.441
I was trying to save you.
Like you sent me to do,
remember?

03:53.483 --> 03:55.818
No, I sent you to bring back
an army, not a wife.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.029
I couldn't get the army
without the wife.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.241
- Rosmund, I did this for you.
- Oh, well, praise the gods,
Tobin.

04:01.282 --> 04:04.827
I'm so bloody grateful you
married someone else for me.

04:04.869 --> 04:08.873
- Where is this army?
- Yavalla stole it
like everything else.

04:08.915 --> 04:12.085
A few hundred men
are still here.

04:12.126 --> 04:14.796
That's more than the almost
zero you had before I left.

04:14.837 --> 04:19.133
A few hundred men?
That's not worth losing you.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.927
- Rosmund, I don't love her.
I don't love her.
- No.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.179
Go back to your wife,
Lord Tobin.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.597
Rosmund.

04:24.639 --> 04:27.225
As your Queen,
I thank you for your sacrifice.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.810
Rosmund,
please don't do this.

04:28.851 --> 04:32.146
But as the woman who loved you,
you've broken my heart.

04:32.188 --> 04:35.024
- Do not do this.
- Please leave.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.444
- Rosmund?
- I must deal with the remaining
Covenant guards.

04:38.486 --> 04:42.115
- Rosmund?
- Please leave me.

04:42.156 --> 04:43.908
Just get out.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.675
( music playing )

05:19.193 --> 05:20.737
What do you have to say
for yourselves?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.868
We were only following orders,
Your Majesty.

05:26.909 --> 05:28.619
"Following orders.

05:28.661 --> 05:29.912
They imprisoned the Blackbloods

05:29.954 --> 05:31.914
and made them kill each other
for sport.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.708
They were starving out
the rest of us,

05:33.750 --> 05:36.294
women and children included.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.715
There's someone
I want you to meet.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.342
( footsteps approaching )

05:56.856 --> 05:57.774
Do you know who this is?

06:00.526 --> 06:04.155
- No.
- She's the woman that
you used to call Two.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.492
Look at her. Look at her.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.579
She's weak and captive,
just an ordinary woman.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.624
- She's not a god.
- I don't believe you.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.878
The Three are no more.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.631
One was killed before your eyes
by our very own Talon.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.510
And Three ran away to hide
like the coward that he is.

06:25.551 --> 06:29.555
The so-called gods
that you worshipped
are finished.

06:29.597 --> 06:33.309
Only I remain,
the rightful ruler
of this Realm.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.740
So what shall I do
with you?

06:47.782 --> 06:50.284
These men should be executed,
Your Majesty.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.925
Lower your heads
and swear your loyalty to me
and you will be pardoned.

07:07.760 --> 07:10.054
This is a mistake, Your Majesty.
These men deserve death.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.391
- Objection noted.
- They're murderers.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.226
They treated the Blackbloods
like dogs.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.812
The Blackbloods did the same
to my people.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.398
Enslaving them,
starving them, beating them.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.777
Garret?

07:27.405 --> 07:30.074
I thought you should
have killed Zed and his men
after what they did to us.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.161
But Your Majesty granted
him pardon and there he stands.

07:33.202 --> 07:37.039
But had it not been for Zed,
Your Majesty would still be
Yavalla's slave.

07:37.081 --> 07:40.126
Might even be dead.
So, what do I think?

07:40.168 --> 07:44.422
I think Your Majesty
is considerably wiser than I
in these decisions.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.434
There is a common enemy
out there.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.811
Yavalla will enslave us all
and send us to an early grave

07:58.853 --> 08:02.523
if we do not learn
how to stand together.

08:02.565 --> 08:07.653
I need every able-bodied,
uninfected man we can get.

08:07.695 --> 08:09.280
So I ask you again,

08:09.322 --> 08:12.617
will you pledge your loyalty
to me as your Queen?

08:17.872 --> 08:19.916
We pledge our loyalty
to you.

08:19.957 --> 08:23.753
We will fight by your side
to rid the world of
our common enemy.

08:28.716 --> 08:32.094
Guards:
I pledge Your Majesty.
I pledge to serve you.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.972
- I pledge to serve you.
- I pledge to serve you,
Your Majesty.

08:35.014 --> 08:39.685
This wasn't our deal.
You promised me sanctuary
at the Outpost.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.606
That's why we've
given you the safest,
most secure room in town.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.110
You're welcome.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.205
- Come on.
- I need a minute
with her alone.

09:06.462 --> 09:12.134
We failed the whole world
when we failed to kill you,
Blackblood.

09:12.176 --> 09:16.973
Tell me, is it a burden
knowing all of the world's
troubles are your fault?

09:17.014 --> 09:19.934
Yavalla's responsible
for this mess.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.687
And you are responsible
for Yavalla.

09:22.728 --> 09:27.108
Was it not you
who brought her here?

09:27.149 --> 09:30.653
On the road you said something
about how you thought we brought
through another kinj.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.282
The white kinj Yavalla bears.

09:34.323 --> 09:37.743
But we didn't bring it through
the Plane of Ashes.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.413
It was here at the Outpost
hidden in a secret chamber.

09:40.454 --> 09:43.332
So you've said.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.377
You assumed we brought it
through the portal because
there's a seventh kinj

09:46.419 --> 09:48.838
in the Plane of Ashes,
isn't there?

09:53.676 --> 09:55.970
Why do you think
there is a seventh kinj?

09:56.012 --> 09:58.806
When we found Zed's kinj,
there was a table with
seven bowls.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.393
We know only of six kinjes.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.022
The red,
which you foolishly
killed with One,

10:06.063 --> 10:08.524
mine, and Three has his kinj.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.693
Plus mine, Zed,
and Yavalla's make six.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.987
So why was there seven bowls
at the shrine?

10:13.029 --> 10:16.407
Perhaps you miscounted.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.659
I can count.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.911
What does the seventh kinj do?

10:20.953 --> 10:23.914
I know of no seventh kinj.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.834
Unhand me.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.961
Not until you tell me
what it does.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.216
I can do this all day.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.097
There is,
or at least once was,

10:40.139 --> 10:42.266
a black kinj.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.478
A black kinj?
And what does it do?

10:49.065 --> 10:51.233
It has only one purpose--

10:51.275 --> 10:53.819
to kill anyone
it comes in contact with.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.696
Would it kill Yavalla?

10:55.738 --> 10:58.115
It would kill whomever
its bearer touches.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.703
And it's in
the Plane of Ashes?

11:02.745 --> 11:04.163
I do not know.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.045
I swear to you,

11:11.087 --> 11:16.050
we have searched for
the black kinj for centuries
without any success.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.262
Even while seeking it,
we lived in fear of finding it.

11:22.223 --> 11:26.268
Do not go looking
for that kinj, Blackblood.

11:26.310 --> 11:29.271
Some things are best left
unfound.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.486
Blackblood...

11:35.528 --> 11:39.657
the death kinj may be a way
to destroy your enemy,

11:39.699 --> 11:42.868
but more likely
it will destroy you

11:42.910 --> 11:45.830
and anyone close to you.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.840
( knocking )

12:09.937 --> 12:12.773
This man was drunk
and disorderly.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.846
The gods will bless
your posterity forever.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.557
I live to serve,
your Holiness.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.352
You have a plan to escape
this wretched place?

12:50.394 --> 12:52.813
Others are clearing an exit,
your Holiness.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.344
Never doubt the power
of the Three.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.514
Rise.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.859
( knocking )

13:43.531 --> 13:45.407
Busy?

13:45.449 --> 13:47.535
Supply inventory hasn't been
tallied in weeks,

13:47.576 --> 13:49.578
our military
is in shambles,

13:49.620 --> 13:52.206
and Yavalla grows stronger
every day.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.962
And how about you?

13:58.003 --> 14:02.800
Out of curiosity, Talon,
how sure were you about
the whole plan of killing me?

14:04.260 --> 14:06.345
- And how much do you remember?
- All of it.

14:06.387 --> 14:10.266
- Oh, gods.
- I can still see your face now.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.643
- I did not look like that.
- Yes, you did.

14:12.685 --> 14:16.355
I remember it vividly.
Did you know the plan
would work?

14:16.397 --> 14:18.357
I mean, we had a hunch
it would.

14:18.399 --> 14:21.485
- So, total gamble?
- Complete stab in the dark.

14:21.527 --> 14:24.905
Oh, good. Good to know
you're all so concerned.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.157
I mean, I suggested
we try Tobin first.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.034
Oh.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.703
Tobin.

14:30.744 --> 14:33.539
Shouldn't have even bothered
reviving that one.

14:33.581 --> 14:38.669
Yeah, I'm--
I'm sorry about that, Gwynn.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.839
Maybe I'm better off
without him.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.800
He did do it to serve you.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.262
Yes, but he did it
to serve Queen Rosmund.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.806
He was the one person
I was saving for myself.

14:50.848 --> 14:52.892
For Gwynn,
not for the Realm.

14:55.185 --> 14:59.481
But I don't have time to be
upset about such trifles.

14:59.523 --> 15:01.775
If Janzo and Wren
don't find a cure soon,

15:01.817 --> 15:03.569
then how are we going
to stop Yavalla?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.446
Well, if they don't find
something soon,

15:05.487 --> 15:07.197
Zed and I will try
to kill her again.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.742
- I thought she can't be killed.
- Not with the stab of a sword.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.286
But we're hoping
more severe methods work.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.246
Well, you'll have
to find her first, right?

15:15.748 --> 15:16.749
Yes.

15:19.043 --> 15:22.212
And so far we have no idea
where she is.

15:30.137 --> 15:33.182
( grunting )

15:33.223 --> 15:35.893
( screaming )

15:52.284 --> 15:55.621
They killed the gate guards,
Your Majesty, and escaped
into the night.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.504
I warned you not to pardon
the red guards.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.005
And now they're broken
Two out.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.092
I took a risk
giving them a second chance.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.886
- Will I regret
having given you one?
- No, Your Majesty.

16:10.928 --> 16:13.138
I'll have my Blackbloods
go after them. Our Lu-Qiri
can hunt them down.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.392
- No, I won't permit that.
- Why? You can't just
let Two get away.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.185
This isn't the battle
we're fighting now, Zed.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.979
It was your mistake
that set her free.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.563
I'm well aware
I made a mistake.

16:21.605 --> 16:24.358
I don't need you pointing
it out.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.943
Just trying to help you
fix it, that's all.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.529
Listen,
I'm telling you not to.

16:28.570 --> 16:30.739
I need you, your Blackbloods,
and your Lu-Qiri here.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.450
We barely have enough men
as it is at this Outpost.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.330
Yes, Your Majesty.

16:38.372 --> 16:40.290
Thank you, Zed.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.771
What?

17:04.231 --> 17:07.609
When was the last time
you slept?

17:07.651 --> 17:09.778
Why does everyone
keep asking me that?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.281
There'll be plenty
of time for me to sleep
once I find a cure.

17:23.459 --> 17:27.629
You didn't come down here
to ask me about my sleep, Zed.
What do you want?

17:27.671 --> 17:29.631
I was hoping you could help me
with something.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.092
Mm-hmm, what?

17:32.134 --> 17:35.137
You know Yavalla
better than anyone.

17:35.179 --> 17:38.432
Any idea where
she might have gone?

17:38.474 --> 17:39.391
You have to be kidding me.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.023
Do you see what
I'm trying to do here?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.108
- You're trying to find
a cure for Yavalla's kinjes.
- Mm-hmm.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.444
And why have I dedicated
every hour of every day

17:50.486 --> 17:52.863
to finding that cure
without any sleep?

17:52.905 --> 17:54.573
Well, the sooner you find one,
the fewer people get infected.

17:54.615 --> 17:59.953
Incorrect.
So I can find one
before you kill my mother.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.500
- Ah.
- Yet you have the audacity

18:04.541 --> 18:07.002
to come down here and ask me
where you can find her.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.463
What? So you can go off
and kill her before
I find a cure?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.840
Not necessarily, Wren.
Just in case you don't find one.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.635
- Oh, I have every intention
of finding one.
- And if you don't?

18:14.676 --> 18:16.386
If I don't, I'm sure as hell
not going to help you find her

18:16.428 --> 18:17.721
just so you can go off
and kill her.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.479
Are you really saying
that your loyalties
lie more with Yavalla

18:25.521 --> 18:27.689
and her attempts to infect
the whole world

18:27.731 --> 18:30.150
than with those of us
who are trying to stop her?

18:30.192 --> 18:33.070
- That is not what I'm saying.
- Then tell me where
I can find her!

18:33.112 --> 18:37.074
I have no idea where Yavalla
would go on this world.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.493
I might know
in the Plane of Ashes,

18:39.535 --> 18:43.038
but on this world,
I have no idea.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.293
Then why didn't you say that
in the first place

18:48.335 --> 18:49.920
instead of trying
to make me feel like an ass
for even asking?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.797
Because you should feel like
an ass for asking.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.715
Now go away.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.979
Guards!

19:49.021 --> 19:51.398
I think I might have a way
to find Yavalla.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.656
Gwynn, what's wrong?

19:59.698 --> 20:01.909
- What's so urgent?
- I think I know
how to find Yavalla.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.244
- That's amazing. How?
- Rosmund?

20:04.286 --> 20:07.998
- What's he doing here?
- I saw Garret sneaking out
of the barracks.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.043
- What is all this about?
- Look, I've been having
these dreams.

20:11.084 --> 20:14.087
So have I.
More like memories.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.215
Are they like moments
that happened, but not to you?

20:16.256 --> 20:19.885
Yes. It's like I'm seeing
a world through...

20:19.927 --> 20:22.596
other people's eyes.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.390
I think they're fragments
of memories from when we were
connected to Yavalla.

20:25.432 --> 20:29.228
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Garret. I'm not crazy
if that's what you're asking.

20:29.269 --> 20:32.814
- And nor am I.
- Janzo, if Tobin and I are
both having these visions,

20:32.856 --> 20:35.150
it must mean that
it's normal for people
who are United, right?

20:35.192 --> 20:37.402
Oh, sure.
Perfectly normal.

20:37.444 --> 20:39.029
To be part of a hive mind,
get killed,

20:39.071 --> 20:41.031
brought back to life,
and then have shared memories?

20:41.073 --> 20:42.032
- Normal.
- Right.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.408
The point is these people,

20:43.450 --> 20:44.618
they're being drawn somewhere.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.620
Into the mountains, right?

20:46.662 --> 20:47.621
Like they're on a pilgrimage.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.209
They're traveling to see
Yavalla.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.294
Which mountains did you see?

20:56.213 --> 20:59.633
I don't know. Do you?

20:59.675 --> 21:01.885
No.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.640
Right. As soon as we come up
with a way to kill her,

21:06.682 --> 21:08.600
we should head out and find
a group of infected pilgrims

21:08.642 --> 21:10.727
- to follow to Yavalla.
- I'm in.

21:10.769 --> 21:14.022
Tobin, you can't come.

21:14.064 --> 21:17.276
- Neither can you, Garret.
- What are you talking about?
Of course we're going.

21:17.317 --> 21:20.654
You're both liabilities.
How many times have you
almost been infected?

21:20.696 --> 21:23.282
Look, I know the risks,
and I can take care of myself.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.867
- So can I.
- We can't get distracted
covering your backs.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.245
You're talking about going
into the center of the hive.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.831
Yavalla will be surrounded
by the infected,
thousands of them.

21:30.872 --> 21:35.252
Yes, but if we get infected,
then as soon as she's killed,
we'll be freed, right?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.462
Right.
But if either of you
get infected,

21:37.504 --> 21:40.090
then suddenly Yavalla
will have access to your minds.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.092
She'll know everything
that you know.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.012
Granted it's not a lot
in either case.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.348
Nevertheless, she will know
whatever plan we come up with.

21:49.891 --> 21:51.476
You'll both stay here,

21:51.518 --> 21:52.853
help defend this Outpost.

22:04.531 --> 22:06.491
( snorts )

22:08.243 --> 22:10.912
( murmuring, snorts )

22:29.723 --> 22:30.932
( murmuring )

22:36.271 --> 22:39.066
What? What are you doing?

22:41.777 --> 22:44.321
Why are you letting me sleep?

22:44.363 --> 22:48.283
Um, I thought you could
do with a rest.

22:48.325 --> 22:51.328
- Come here.
- I don't have time
to rest, Janzo.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.330
Well, actually,
it's been my experience

22:53.372 --> 22:55.957
that even just one hour
of shut-eye

22:55.999 --> 22:57.667
can improve productivity
by tenfold.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.628
All right.
I'll take your word for it.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.755
Hopefully one of these will work
before Zed and his gang

23:01.797 --> 23:03.757
figure out how to kill
my mother.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.968
Though they'll probably never
figure it out without our help.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.387
Right?

23:10.097 --> 23:12.641
- Right.
- Right.

23:14.684 --> 23:16.770
I had to make this device
behind Wren's back

23:16.812 --> 23:18.980
give it's designed
to kill her mother and all.

23:19.022 --> 23:21.358
Try not to waste it
this time.

23:21.400 --> 23:25.195
- How do we light it?
- No ignition necessary.
Just throw it at Yavalla.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.572
The inner casings will break,
and then the components inside

23:27.614 --> 23:29.408
will mix and react
with each other

23:29.449 --> 23:31.993
causing her to burst
into flames so hot
it will eat away her flesh

23:32.035 --> 23:34.246
faster than she can regenerate.
Theoretically.

23:34.287 --> 23:36.665
- Well,
that's a pleasant thought.
- No, it's not.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.500
Whilst you're at it,
chop off her head.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.086
It might sever her kinj
from regenerating
the rest of her body.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.213
You only have one chance
after all.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.799
And anything else?

23:45.841 --> 23:48.009
Try not to die, Talon.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.928
Not dying's one
of my best qualities.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.648
Come on, please.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.405
Wren, you need to take a break.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.906
You know that's not
an option, Janzo.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.450
I have to find this
kinj-killing poison

24:11.491 --> 24:14.119
before your cruel friends
go off and murder my mother.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.829
They're only trying to save
the world like we are.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.831
My mother's a victim, too,
you know?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.167
She's been enslaved
by that kinj just
like everyone else.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.044
Before she got the kinj,
she was a good person.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.713
- Was she?
- Yes. She was a loving mother.

24:24.754 --> 24:27.924
- Really?
- No, not really.

24:27.966 --> 24:31.303
But she's still my mother.
I need to solve this
before they leave.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.225
Um... Wren?

24:38.685 --> 24:40.395
Wren?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.523
I'm sorry.
They've already left.

24:47.903 --> 24:52.282
I don't know if I should hope
they succeed or fail.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.201
For what it's worth,

24:54.242 --> 24:56.286
the odds are heavy
for failure.

25:01.833 --> 25:04.294
Rosmund, wait.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.462
Not now, Tobin.
I'm quite busy.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.297
Please don't cut me out
like this.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.884
Give me another chance.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.302
There are no other chances.
You're married.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.513
Now please leave me alone.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.598
Message from the quartermaster,
Your Majesty.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.393
- What is it?
- "I regret to inform you
that your storehouses

25:20.435 --> 25:22.103
will be completely empty
by week's end."

25:22.145 --> 25:25.524
What? Give me that.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.943
- Rosmund--
- Tobin, I don't have
time for you.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.120
♪ They go on a journey
and they fought the beast ♪

25:39.162 --> 25:41.706
♪ They share some mead
and they share some meat ♪

25:41.748 --> 25:44.501
♪ 'Cause Tobin and Munt
are two best friends ♪

25:51.967 --> 25:53.927
Aah!

25:59.391 --> 26:01.935
- Gods above, woman!
- Don't you "Gods above,
woman" me.

26:01.977 --> 26:04.521
- You said you'd
stopped drinking.
- Leave me alone.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.524
No! So you're in love
with another woman.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.984
Big deal.
It's time to grow up, Tobin.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.319
This is not how I imagined
my life to turn out.

26:11.361 --> 26:13.863
Oh, and you think
it's all rosy
on my end of the deal?

26:13.905 --> 26:17.701
I'm married to the drunk
who would be king.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.995
And instead of living
comfortably in Aegisford,

26:20.036 --> 26:22.247
- where you could learn
to love me...
- ( scoffs )

26:22.289 --> 26:25.166
...I'm stuck here
where every day
I get to see the woman

26:25.208 --> 26:27.919
my drunken husband
dreams about in my place.

26:27.961 --> 26:30.297
Yeah, well, you're welcome.
Because that's what
you wanted, wasn't it?

26:30.338 --> 26:33.883
- Congratulations.
- You made a promise
to get my army.

26:33.925 --> 26:38.555
But what good is my army
if you're too drunk
to command it?

26:38.597 --> 26:41.182
- The army is gone, Falista.
- Not all of it.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.560
- There's still
a few hundred men.
- Lot of good that'll be.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.147
General Rolshaad won
the battle of Kolny
with only 100 men!

26:49.107 --> 26:51.985
- Look at me!
- Aah!

26:52.027 --> 26:53.945
Gods!
What did you do that for?

26:53.987 --> 26:55.655
- What?
- You hit me on the head.

26:55.697 --> 26:56.740
No I didn't.

27:03.830 --> 27:06.583
You don't have to love me.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.585
But you need
to pull yourself together

27:08.627 --> 27:12.756
and live in a manner
worthy of your station.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.425
You still have enough men
to make a mark.

27:18.511 --> 27:20.472
So let's go make it.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.897
You know, if you're
protecting a secret that
may well destroy the world,

27:28.938 --> 27:32.275
sensible thing to do would be
to include your research notes.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.610
It would be nice of them,
wouldn't it?

27:33.652 --> 27:35.904
Yes, it would have.

27:35.945 --> 27:38.531
A nice little instruction sheet
folded up inside the box.

27:38.573 --> 27:40.575
"How To Stop a Kinj Disaster."

27:40.617 --> 27:43.244
"Step one,
don't open the box."

27:43.286 --> 27:45.830
"Step two,
no, you opened the box!"

27:47.832 --> 27:48.750
( snorts )

27:54.923 --> 27:57.926
Ah! Ah!
It burns like fire.

27:57.967 --> 28:01.888
- What does?
- This seal. Except I don't
think it's wax.

28:01.930 --> 28:04.307
It-- it tastes more like
an intense burn.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.768
It tastes like it would
burn a hole through
your insides.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.020
What wax
are you talking about?

28:11.106 --> 28:13.983
From the map.
There was a seal on the corner,

28:14.025 --> 28:15.068
except it doesn't
seal anything.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.528
It tastes more like, um,

28:16.569 --> 28:20.115
and intense mustard
with a dash of, um, ugh,

28:20.156 --> 28:22.492
volcano or something.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.078
( sniffs, gasps )
An antidote.

28:25.120 --> 28:26.955
I'll check the archives.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.251
Right.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.337
You don't think
they would have...

28:34.379 --> 28:36.423
I would've.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.183
Maybe this is it.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.978
Wren?

28:50.019 --> 28:52.439
Look. Ficter's sap.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.691
Tastes like mustard,
reddy coloration.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.152
- Uh-huh.
- Waxy consistency,
intense burn.

28:57.193 --> 28:59.696
- I'll take your word for it.
- Gods, if this is actually

28:59.738 --> 29:01.614
Ficter's sap, this is amazing.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.534
We haven't seen Ficter's sap
in about 200 years.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.786
- This Ficter's bush is extinct.
- But we were the first
to open this box

29:06.828 --> 29:08.580
in probably
a couple hundred years.

29:08.621 --> 29:11.332
Scrape off some of that sap
and mix it with some warm oil.

29:11.374 --> 29:14.043
We need to do a test.
See if it will kill the kinj.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.921
All right.
Hurry, Janzo.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.758
We have to go after
your friends and stop them
before it's too late.

29:19.799 --> 29:23.052
- ( muttering )
- Huh? Mm.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.723
( gags, groans )

29:26.765 --> 29:28.558
Oh, gods, it does burn.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.393
Do I ever exaggerate?

29:35.190 --> 29:38.568
- Wren? Get me a rat.
- No, no, no.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.570
We can't waste it on a rat.
We only have two,
maybe three doses.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.572
We need to know if it works.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.658
Maybe they just
put Ficter's sap on that
piece of paper by chance

29:45.700 --> 29:47.660
and it has nothing
to do with anything.

29:47.702 --> 29:50.079
Then we'll test it on a human.
And if it works,
we'll have saved a life.

29:50.121 --> 29:54.042
- And if it kills them?
- Then I'm sorry that they died
sooner than they would have,

29:54.083 --> 29:55.627
but at least he did die
trying to save the Realm?

29:55.668 --> 29:58.588
Right.
Human test subject it is.

29:59.672 --> 30:00.882
Gods, I hope this works.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.804
The rats detected this one
earlier today.

30:10.099 --> 30:12.602
Why did you come
to this Outpost?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.604
You can try to keep us out,

30:14.646 --> 30:17.649
but you will not stop us.

30:17.690 --> 30:23.196
One by one,
all will be United.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.365
- Good enough for me.
- Mm. All right.

30:50.473 --> 30:53.685
- Is he dead?
- Gods, I hope not.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.979
( screaming )

31:02.485 --> 31:05.446
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

31:05.488 --> 31:08.700
Just to be sure,
why did you come to the Outpost?

31:08.741 --> 31:13.663
Half my town was infected.
I came here for refuge.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.000
How are you feeling
about the world right now?
Happy and at peace?

31:18.084 --> 31:21.379
More like sore and hungry.

31:21.421 --> 31:24.674
( chuckles )

31:24.716 --> 31:27.343
Wren, we did it.

31:27.385 --> 31:30.263
We did it!

31:30.305 --> 31:33.057
Janzo, Janzo!
We have to go save my mother.

31:33.099 --> 31:35.059
- What? No, Wren. No, wait.
- Come on!

31:35.101 --> 31:37.437
Wren? No.
We can talk about this. Wren?

31:40.857 --> 31:43.860
I'm not sure how well-suited
you and I are to go
traipsing across the Realm

31:43.902 --> 31:45.695
on a mission to save
the world.

31:45.737 --> 31:48.156
Well,
I'm not going to stand by
and let your friends

31:48.197 --> 31:50.283
- murder my mother
when we have a cure.
- Maybe have a cure.

31:50.325 --> 31:53.494
- It worked.
- Maybe it only works
on the offspring kinjes.

31:53.536 --> 31:57.081
I mean, why would they give us
enough sap for three doses?

31:57.123 --> 32:00.168
Why not just give us one
if it's only intended
to kill one kinj?

32:00.209 --> 32:02.754
Well, maybe they're spares
in case we waste one.
I don't know.

32:02.795 --> 32:05.715
Well-- well, how will
we even get close enough to
your mother to inject her?

32:05.757 --> 32:08.593
Janzo, you can either
help me or get out of my way

32:08.635 --> 32:10.511
because I am going
with or without you.

32:10.553 --> 32:13.431
All right.
If I can't talk you out of it,

32:13.473 --> 32:15.600
then I'm certainly not going
to let you go alone.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.518
I'm going to go and get Munt
to go with us.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.910
Well, they shouldn't be
too hard to follow.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.120
- What are they doing?
- I think they're praying.

32:36.162 --> 32:39.415
In the old Blackblood
sun worship, they used to do
something similar.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.502
Guess now Yavalla's
got them all praying to her.

32:42.543 --> 32:46.464
( chanting )

32:48.549 --> 32:51.052
( sighing )

32:54.681 --> 32:56.599
Yeah, well, it's creepy.

32:58.768 --> 33:01.145
You know, I can't help
but wonder if that kinj
made Yavalla bad

33:01.187 --> 33:02.313
or if she was always that way.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.943
What difference does it make?

33:06.985 --> 33:09.112
- She's evil now.
- Well, it makes
a difference to me.

33:09.153 --> 33:12.573
I followed her devoutly
my whole life.

33:12.615 --> 33:14.450
Maybe I was just blind.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.077
Who knows what's true with her
and what's a lie?

33:19.956 --> 33:22.375
- I know she lied
about my father.
- You think so?

33:22.417 --> 33:26.754
I'm sure of it.
The only question is
was he helping her all along?

33:29.757 --> 33:32.677
I mean, why would
he give her that box?

33:32.719 --> 33:35.972
I wish I could tell you, Talon.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.558
I was just as deceived
as everyone else.

33:41.644 --> 33:46.774
So, you want to be the one
to set her on fire
or chop off her head?

33:48.860 --> 33:50.445
Chop off her head.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.574
- Deal.
- ( chuckles )

33:57.118 --> 33:59.037
Let's go.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.007
The reserve silos will last us
for a few more days at most,

34:11.049 --> 34:14.135
so we should send men out
into the countryside

34:14.177 --> 34:16.012
to collect whatever
they can of the harvest.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.597
Well, what about game
in the forest?

34:17.638 --> 34:20.349
Picked clean by
the Lu-Qiri and Yavalla.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.226
If we don't get meat soon,
those Lu-Qiri

34:22.268 --> 34:24.645
are going to start looking
pretty tasty themselves.

34:24.687 --> 34:27.190
- You've changed.
- I've changed?

34:27.231 --> 34:29.650
What about you?
You're far from the perfect,

34:29.692 --> 34:32.153
always do the right thing Garret
that I grew up with.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.447
Well, this is a hell
of a place to grow up.

34:34.489 --> 34:38.451
Hell of a place now.

34:38.493 --> 34:39.869
When you think back
to that little girl

34:39.911 --> 34:42.455
climbing over these
old walls,

34:42.497 --> 34:45.124
could you ever imagine
that this is how your life
would turn out?

34:45.166 --> 34:47.085
No.

34:47.126 --> 34:49.796
I mean, for one,
I was certain you and I
would be married.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.090
Oh.

34:52.131 --> 34:53.841
That was the dream,
wasn't it?

34:56.260 --> 34:58.137
I always knew...

34:58.179 --> 35:01.265
that you weren't meant
for me, Gwynn.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.856
( chuckles )
What a sorry pair we are.

35:08.898 --> 35:11.067
Yeah.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.568
Talon's off alone
with her former lover.

35:12.610 --> 35:14.904
Your betrothed has a new wife.

35:14.946 --> 35:17.323
And here we are,
still stuck at the Outpost,

35:17.365 --> 35:20.660
doing our best to live up
to what's expected of us.

35:24.705 --> 35:30.086
Your Majesty, Lord Tobin
just left the Outpost.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.422
- What do you mean?
- I don't know, Your Majesty.
They all rolled out.

35:33.464 --> 35:37.635
- Who all?
- Lord Tobin, his new wife,

35:37.677 --> 35:40.388
and what was left
of the Aegisford army.

35:40.429 --> 35:43.516
And just when it
couldn't get any worse,

35:43.558 --> 35:46.978
my betrothed has stolen
what little army I had left.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.938
Your Majesty,
you should also know

35:48.980 --> 35:51.983
that Master Janzo,
Munt, and Wren,

35:52.024 --> 35:55.278
they are also preparing
to leave.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.237
What?

35:57.363 --> 35:59.323
You got that?
Not too heavy?

35:59.365 --> 36:02.326
- It's very heavy.
- All right, you'll be fine.

36:02.368 --> 36:04.537
- Uh-oh.
- Where are you going?

36:04.579 --> 36:06.247
We found a poison
that kills kinjes.

36:06.289 --> 36:07.665
- Well, that's great.
- Not exactly.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.458
We, um, only have
two doses remaining.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.169
We're going to give
one of them to my mother.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.962
See, we figured that
if we can kill the queen kinj,

36:13.004 --> 36:14.964
then we can stop
this whole thing.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.883
Well, I'll put together
a defense force to
protect you on the road.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.260
No, thank you.
If we turn up with an army,
she won't let us near her.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.345
Gwynn: Well, then
I'll send three of my men
dressed as peasants.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.347
- You'll have a better way--
- With respect, Your Majesty,

36:23.389 --> 36:25.808
I have the best chance
of getting close to my mother.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.768
And Yavalla already knows me,
so it won't be odd
if I arrive with Wren.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.353
We're wasting time.
They have a head start.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.189
If we're going to do this,
we have to leave now.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.481
- Wha-- I--
- Sorry.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.359
- Be safe.
- Munt!

36:35.401 --> 36:37.570
We need to go.
You need to watch our backs.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.156
Janzo, Wren, coming through.
Watch their backs!

36:40.198 --> 36:42.074
- Shh.
- For the whole mission, Munt.

36:42.116 --> 36:44.368
- Oh, is that-- today?
- Right now.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.787
Now. Thank you.
Please take this bag.

36:46.829 --> 36:51.125
- Grab a quick snack
for the road. Right.
- Now, Munt! Now, Munt!

36:51.167 --> 36:53.961
Think that there's
any chance that they'll
actually pull this off?

36:56.297 --> 36:58.132
May the gods be with them.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.560
( chanting )

37:15.566 --> 37:17.276
There they go again.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.570
Seriously, how often do these
nutters need to pray?

37:19.612 --> 37:23.199
At this rate, the world will end
before we ever get to Yavalla.

37:23.241 --> 37:24.909
Maybe that's her plan.

37:26.661 --> 37:28.829
What, delaying us?

37:28.871 --> 37:31.040
She doesn't even know
we're here.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.917
Don't be so sure.

37:32.959 --> 37:35.002
( screeching )

37:36.087 --> 37:37.797
She's got eyes everywhere.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.182
Don't let her get to you, Zed.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.411
I'm Wren.

38:10.621 --> 38:12.206
Daughter of Yavalla.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.460
Can you hear me?

38:29.140 --> 38:32.852
Greetings, Wren.
I've been waiting for you.

38:32.893 --> 38:37.106
- Come closer.
- No, thank you.

38:37.148 --> 38:39.442
I'll keep my distance.

38:39.483 --> 38:43.112
I'd rather speak to
the real you in person.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.490
- Where are you now?
- The Blackblood traitors,
Zed and Talon,

38:46.532 --> 38:49.702
I can see them coming
to kill me.

38:49.744 --> 38:53.706
- Are you part of that?
- No. No, I promise.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.292
But you're right,
they are intent on killing you.

38:56.334 --> 38:59.003
I have to reach you
before they do, Mother.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.880
I'll deal with them myself.

39:02.965 --> 39:05.968
If I may interject, um,
we have a way to save you.

39:06.010 --> 39:09.805
We just have to get to you
before they do.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.932
Follow this man.
He will lead you

39:11.974 --> 39:15.144
and your companions to me
by the shortest path.

39:15.186 --> 39:19.106
It will be good to have you
with me again, Wren.

39:25.696 --> 39:27.740
Come on.

39:27.782 --> 39:31.327
- Janzo, this is bonkers.
- Of course it is, Munt.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.371
But we have to save the world
somehow, don't we?

39:33.412 --> 39:36.540
I don't know.
Mum told me not to meddle with
things I don't understand.

39:36.582 --> 39:38.334
That includes pretty much
everything, doesn't it?

39:38.376 --> 39:40.169
- Yeah.
- Come on. Wren?

39:40.211 --> 39:43.381
What do you mean?
Janzo, what do you mean?

39:46.550 --> 39:48.344
We should hurry.
The sun's almost down.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.054
- Tell that to the pilgrims.
- ( screaming )

39:50.096 --> 39:51.013
Watch out!

39:56.435 --> 39:58.145
How did she know we were here?

39:58.187 --> 40:00.981
That bloody hawk.
Yavalla's watching us.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.983
Then she can watch
her minions die.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.443
( yelling )

40:25.131 --> 40:26.257
What took you so long?

40:26.298 --> 40:27.800
I was already done with mine.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.343
You got all the easy ones.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.476
We need to get under cover,
away from that hawk.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.229
Yavalla will just keep
sending more.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.160
We are here.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.040
Less than a day's walk
from the Outpost.

41:00.082 --> 41:01.375
That's worrisome.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.380
( chanting )

41:08.632 --> 41:11.010
Bloody hell.

41:11.051 --> 41:14.805
Wren: That's the ancient
Blackblood temple.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.392
There's so many of them.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.810
Let's get out of here, Janzo.
Come on.

41:31.363 --> 41:33.741
Uh...

41:33.782 --> 41:37.036
All: Hail, Wren,
daughter of Yavalla.

41:37.077 --> 41:41.665
Hail, Wren,
daughter of Yavalla.

41:41.707 --> 41:45.252
Hail, Wren,
daughter of Yavalla.
