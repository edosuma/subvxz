WEBVTT

00:03.623 --> 00:06.191
â™ª

00:56.623 --> 00:59.191
Hurry it up, Benedict.

01:07.967 --> 01:10.769
Oh, unfortunate.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.505
Remember, it's
a two-stroke penalty

01:13.507 --> 01:16.742
if you're beyond the boundary.
Two.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.912
(laughing)

01:26.352 --> 01:28.954
Where in blazes has he gone?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.190
Benedict! Hurry on!

01:31.192 --> 01:35.627
If you haven't found it by
now, you've bloody well lost it.

01:35.629 --> 01:39.231
No lifting out of a
difficulty, Benedict!

01:39.233 --> 01:42.301
(sighing)
We may as well help.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.971
We'll fan out, shall we?

01:45.973 --> 01:50.042
Almost ready.
He's had his daily rub

01:50.044 --> 01:53.378
and a bath. I daresay
he's rather hungry.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.981
Aren't you, little Roland?

01:55.983 --> 01:59.885
Just one drop
of lime extract.

02:01.821 --> 02:06.225
He has milk, fresh diapers,

02:06.227 --> 02:09.361
and enough solid food to last
him the whole day. I'll take him

02:09.363 --> 02:12.231
for the morning and bring him
to you at lunchtime.

02:12.233 --> 02:15.334
(telephone ringing)
Oh.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.036
Murdoch residence,

02:18.038 --> 02:20.572
Detective William
Murdoch speaking.

02:20.574 --> 02:24.042
I see.

02:24.044 --> 02:26.712
Yes, I'll be right there.

02:26.714 --> 02:31.683
It appears little Roland will
be spending his morning
in the morgue.

02:39.959 --> 02:43.428
What have we,
George? Thank you.
Sir. I'm just arriving myself,

02:43.430 --> 02:47.599
but it seems a group of four
were out on the links; one
of them went into the woods

02:47.601 --> 02:50.969
to retrieve his ball
and that was the last
anybody's seen of him.

02:50.971 --> 02:54.606
Was a search conducted?
By his colleagues, yes.
They claim he vanished

02:54.608 --> 02:56.909
without a trace.
This must be them, sir.

02:56.911 --> 03:00.078
Ahh, Constable
Crabtree!

03:00.080 --> 03:04.216
A pleasure to see you again.
I'm only sorry it is under
such worrisome circumstances.

03:04.218 --> 03:06.752
And you are?
Sir,

03:06.754 --> 03:09.755
this is Roger Newsome.
Of the Mimico Newsomes.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.291
He was mixed up with--
The auto club, yes.

03:12.293 --> 03:15.294
Mr. Newsome, what do you know
of this disappearance?

03:15.296 --> 03:19.131
What can be said? He abandoned
a round in progress.

03:19.133 --> 03:23.302
What kind of man does that?
I certainly won't be signing
his scorecard.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.370
Where did he enter the woods?

03:27.807 --> 03:32.077
Given all these broken branches,
and the fact that the ground's
been disturbed

03:32.079 --> 03:36.782
in several places,
I'd say someone's been
through here recently.

03:36.784 --> 03:41.019
The trail seems to end here.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.656
Well, in that case,

03:44.658 --> 03:49.261
he may have been snatched.
Somebody in some sort
of dirigible.

03:49.263 --> 03:52.364
George...
Well, it's happened
before, sir.

03:52.366 --> 03:56.935
I don't think he went up.
That's quicksand. Be careful.

03:56.937 --> 03:59.638
There's very little in nature
more dangerous than quicksand.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.308
Contrary to popular belief,
and many books, it's
virtually impossible

04:03.310 --> 04:07.346
to be sucked under whilst
in quicksand, George.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.659
But that's not to say
he wasn't put here.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.728
My God.

04:33.139 --> 04:36.642
We'll get him to the morgue
so he can be cleaned up
and examined.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.944
Did your search yield
anything, George?

04:38.946 --> 04:43.382
I discovered a ball,
sir, presumably the one
the victim was looking for.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.318
Sir, I have a request.
Yes?

04:46.320 --> 04:49.755
As you may know, Mr. Newsome
and I have some history.

04:49.757 --> 04:54.860
He treated me terribly in
our last encounter, and I...

04:54.862 --> 04:59.031
Well, sir, I hate him.
Oh?

04:59.033 --> 05:02.701
I feel bad even thinking it,
sir, but I can't pretend
it's not true.

05:02.703 --> 05:07.105
I hate the way he acts
and the way he speaks

05:07.107 --> 05:09.908
and the way he laughs.
I hate his little bow tie

05:09.910 --> 05:12.010
and his stupid face--

05:12.012 --> 05:14.913
Thank you, George.
I apologize. I just...

05:14.915 --> 05:18.850
I wonder if I shouldn't be
excused from the case,
given my personal bias.

05:18.852 --> 05:22.888
Well, so long as I remain
unbiased, I don't see
the problem, George.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.591
I'll see you back
at the Station House.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.934
Oh, Benedict.
Benny, Benny, Benny...

05:35.936 --> 05:39.404
I just keep asking myself
the same question.

05:39.406 --> 05:43.542
How, how can I go on? How?

05:43.544 --> 05:48.013
Do you know of anyone who may
have wished the victim harm?
No.

05:48.015 --> 05:52.250
No.
Every member of this club
regarded him

05:52.252 --> 05:55.253
with fondness and esteem.

05:55.255 --> 05:59.024
James Benedict was
a gift from above.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.094
I'm very sorry we can't be
of more help, Detective.

06:02.096 --> 06:05.797
As I'm sure you know,
I am a great friend
of the constabulary.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.368
Thank you, gentlemen.

06:13.706 --> 06:16.842
Oh, Detective.

06:16.844 --> 06:20.178
George Lyon, club champion.
William Murdoch,

06:20.180 --> 06:23.281
Toronto Constabulary.
Most shocking news.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.250
Have you any idea
how it happened?

06:25.252 --> 06:28.620
My investigation is still
in the early stages.

06:28.622 --> 06:31.957
To think someone killed him
while I was golfing only
a few holes away...

06:31.959 --> 06:34.359
Shameful. Outrageous.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.664
Now, if you'll excuse me.
I'm set for another eighteen.

06:43.269 --> 06:46.037
(babbling)

06:48.307 --> 06:52.010
The victim was struck with
a blunt instrument and beaten
repeatedly about the head.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.813
So, he died
from his injuries?

06:54.815 --> 06:58.817
He was alive and breathing
when he went into the quicksand.
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

06:58.819 --> 07:04.356
Would you be able to tell
what type of weapon was used?
There are some distinct marks

07:04.358 --> 07:08.693
on both the cranium and upper
torso. I think it would be fair
to assume it was a golf club.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.631
Well, the victim's club was
found on the scene. If I brought
it in, would you be able

07:12.633 --> 07:16.668
to tell if it's a match?
I will certainly do my best.
I've finished transcribing

07:16.670 --> 07:19.471
the marks from
the victim's back.
Marks?

07:19.473 --> 07:23.875
He had a series of tiny
punctures on his shoulder blade.

07:23.877 --> 07:28.380
About a dozen in total.
I've made a card with
the location of the holes.

07:28.382 --> 07:31.149
The wounds could have been
made by a man's shoe--

07:31.151 --> 07:34.219
or rather, cleats.
Very good, Miss James.

07:34.221 --> 07:39.391
I'll see if this pattern
is a match for any of
the players' cleats.

07:39.393 --> 07:43.295
I suppose that means you'll be
leaving little Roland with me.

07:44.864 --> 07:49.534
He seems much happier here.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.372
So this punter hits the ball
into the woods off the tee.

07:54.374 --> 07:57.209
He goes looking for it
and someone clubs him.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.377
And since it would be
impossible to anticipate

07:59.379 --> 08:01.546
Mr. Benedict directing
the ball into the woods

08:01.548 --> 08:04.850
on that hole, we have
to assume that it was
a crime of opportunity.

08:04.852 --> 08:08.420
I suppose it could have been
a golfer on a neighbouring hole.

08:10.823 --> 08:14.759
Or...

08:14.761 --> 08:18.763
What if he meant to do it?
I'm afraid I don't follow.

08:18.765 --> 08:21.399
Golf is a cruel
mistress, Murdoch.

08:21.401 --> 08:25.604
It holds a man under its spell.
I could believe that he hit
the ball into the woods

08:25.606 --> 08:28.173
on purpose, then killed himself
just to get away from the game.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.576
Golf seems little more
than a distraction, sir.

08:31.578 --> 08:34.913
I can hardly believe that it
would drive a man to suicide.

08:34.915 --> 08:38.283
Seems like fun at first.

08:40.219 --> 08:42.254
Just one good round,

08:42.256 --> 08:44.589
even one good shot,

08:44.591 --> 08:48.627
and you're hooked.
You become a slave to it.

08:48.629 --> 08:53.331
For hours and hours, day after
day, you hit the ball
towards the hole.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.569
You hit the ball towards
the hole. On and on.

08:57.571 --> 09:01.206
It gets into your head.
It consumes you.

09:01.208 --> 09:06.144
All you can think about
is hitting the damn ball
into the damn hole!

09:11.651 --> 09:15.554
Golf is a curse, Murdoch.
Don't you forget it.

09:22.295 --> 09:25.497
Oh, Detective.

09:25.499 --> 09:28.033
Mr. Lyon.
To what do we owe

09:28.035 --> 09:31.770
the pleasure?
I have something terribly
important to discuss with you.

09:31.772 --> 09:35.674
Oh. Regarding
Mr. Benedict's death?
No, sir. Regarding your death.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.443
Is that some sort of threat,
Mr. Lyon?
A threat?

09:38.445 --> 09:42.380
Ha! No, my good man,
I'm talking about insurance.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.517
Detective, I'm here
to offer you

09:45.519 --> 09:48.587
the security and well-being
that can only be attained

09:48.589 --> 09:52.123
through the purchase of a full-
coverage insurance policy.

09:52.125 --> 09:55.360
Oh, I really don't think I--
Do you have a wife, Detective?
Children?

09:55.362 --> 09:58.463
Yes.
And what would happen to them

09:58.465 --> 10:00.999
if something unspeakable
were to happen to you?

10:01.001 --> 10:04.536
Oh, I don't... I really--
What would become

10:04.538 --> 10:08.373
of your beautiful family
should some fiery blaze
engulf your peaceful home?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.710
I don't know.
These are imponderable
questions, sir.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.546
And their only answer
is insurance.

10:14.548 --> 10:18.049
Mr. Lyon, have you sold
insurance policies

10:18.051 --> 10:21.052
to the members of the golf club?
To nearly every member.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.555
Golf has become my passion,

10:23.557 --> 10:26.024
but insurance remains
my business.

10:26.026 --> 10:29.561
Next year it will finance my
trip to St. Louis to play
in the Olympic Games.

10:29.563 --> 10:34.232
Oh. And did you sell such
a policy to Mr. Benedict?

10:34.234 --> 10:37.202
I'll tell you all you care
to know about if you will
play a round with me.

10:37.204 --> 10:40.238
No one goes uninsured
after eighteen holes

10:40.240 --> 10:43.208
with George Lyon.
Murdoch. I've sent
Crabtree to the golf club

10:43.210 --> 10:45.877
to look for a match
on those golf cleats.

10:45.879 --> 10:50.548
Sir, allow me to introduce
Mr. George Lyon. One of our
country's finest golfers.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.718
Oh, are you?
Oh. Inspector.

10:53.720 --> 10:58.456
It's a pleasure. Would you care
to join us for a round?
Us?

11:00.393 --> 11:04.362
Well, sir, it could only aid
in the investigation.
A curse, Murdoch.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.532
A curse.

11:14.407 --> 11:18.410
The mark is too narrow.
I'll try the other side.

11:18.412 --> 11:22.714
You mark my words, Doctor.
Keep your eye on your husband,
or you're going to lose him.

11:22.716 --> 11:26.951
William Murdoch is a man of
discipline. I'm sure he can
handle a round of golf.

11:32.425 --> 11:35.894
This one still isn't as wide
as the ones on the body.
It seems the weapon

11:35.896 --> 11:39.698
may have had a flat edge to it.
Forewarned is forearmed,
Mrs. Murdoch.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.803
I can't imagine why anyone
would enjoy the sport at all.
Seems rather silly.

11:44.805 --> 11:49.774
I thought that too until
I started swinging this club
about. It's quite pleasurable.

11:52.478 --> 11:54.846
Very nice.
Thank you.

11:56.782 --> 12:00.485
Was the victim's
policy significant?
The beneficiary is in line

12:00.487 --> 12:04.255
for fifty thousand dollars.
And who would that be?

12:04.257 --> 12:08.426
I'll check my records as soon
as I get back to the office and
will contact you directly.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.863
And what of Mr. Benedict's
foursome?

12:11.865 --> 12:14.065
Loyal friends.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.168
They do circumvent course policy
on one matter, though.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.205
They play four-ball golf
for money.
Oh?

12:20.207 --> 12:24.175
Any significant sums?
Sometimes up to fifty
cents a hole.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.678
Go ahead, Detective.

12:26.680 --> 12:29.013
Strike it with some gusto.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.892
Well, well, well!

12:40.894 --> 12:44.829
Very fine.

12:44.831 --> 12:48.967
You have a lovely swing,
Detective. Now, I do have
some pointers for you.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.841
Come now, Constable Crabtree.
This is nothing more
than a charade.

12:56.843 --> 12:59.244
I can tell you
who the killer is.

12:59.246 --> 13:03.815
I'm not interested in
your theories, Mr. Newsome.
It was Benedict's brother,

13:03.817 --> 13:08.653
Wilbur. The man
is truly a weasel.
More sherry, man.

13:08.655 --> 13:11.890
What is the damnable holdup?

13:11.892 --> 13:15.794
A weasel through and through.
A scoundrel, I daresay.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.897
The last time I was stuck
playing with him, he refused

13:18.899 --> 13:22.934
to do the proper ball drop
behind his head.

13:22.936 --> 13:26.337
He just dropped it
in front of him?
Yes!

13:26.339 --> 13:30.708
You three realize you are
the prime suspects in a murder
investigation, don't you?

13:30.710 --> 13:33.178
How can you say such a thing?

13:33.180 --> 13:36.347
Because you were the ones
with Mr. Benedict just
prior to his death.

13:36.349 --> 13:40.051
We know that Wilbur Benedict
was seen here in the clubhouse,

13:40.053 --> 13:43.388
so how could he magically appear
at the crime scene just
at the right time?

13:43.390 --> 13:47.025
Anyone here in the clubhouse
could have stepped out the back
and nipped into those woods.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.365
Oh my!

13:54.367 --> 13:57.402
That is quite the get-up.

13:57.404 --> 14:01.639
They allow for
terrific mobility.
I have news

14:01.641 --> 14:04.742
regarding the victim's club.
Ah yes, was it used
in the murder?

14:04.744 --> 14:09.113
I don't believe so.
It seems the wounds were made
by a club with a narrow base

14:09.115 --> 14:12.383
and a flattened head.
That would be a putter,
no doubt.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.787
So the murder weapon
is still missing.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.289
You two seem to be
making a fine day of it.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.758
You should join us
for a round sometime.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.195
You must be Mrs. Murdoch.
George Lyon.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.464
Dr. Julia Ogden.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.467
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm afraid I must be
getting back to work.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.402
Another time, then.

14:34.306 --> 14:36.941
Oh, fine putt.
Thank you.

14:36.943 --> 14:39.110
I'll be along
to take care of Roland

14:39.112 --> 14:42.013
as soon as
I finish with golf.

14:45.251 --> 14:48.186
Let's go,
Detective.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.328
The pattern of cleat marks
wasn't much help, sir.
It matches a popular shoe

14:57.330 --> 15:00.498
worn by at least
a dozen men here.
Including all the members

15:00.500 --> 15:04.769
of the victim's foursome.
Gentlemen.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.572
A few more questions.
Oh, come now,

15:07.574 --> 15:10.975
Detective Murdoch. We were
just about to enjoy a round.

15:10.977 --> 15:16.514
It seems Mr. Newsome
has lost his putter.
Indeed.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.483
How do you explain that,
Mr. Newsome?

15:18.485 --> 15:20.685
I threw it into the water
hazard some time ago.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.787
Why would you do that?

15:22.789 --> 15:25.123
It had become disagreeable.

15:25.125 --> 15:28.393
Putting with my driver
has brought my handicap
down to a half-one.

15:28.395 --> 15:32.797
Did either of you witness the
discarding of this putter?
(both): No.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.835
Well, that's convenient.
Not to mention hard to believe.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.505
How could a golfer become
so upset that he would throw

15:40.507 --> 15:43.207
perfectly good
golf clubs into a lake?

15:43.209 --> 15:47.679
Clearly the errors in your
putting were the fault of your
stroke and not of your club.

15:47.681 --> 15:51.616
It was too the putter's fault!
Be that as it may.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.652
If that club was used
in a murder, Mr. Newsome,

15:54.654 --> 15:57.021
that club will
lead you to the noose.

16:07.433 --> 16:11.002
I think that's
the lot of them, sir.
I find it astounding

16:11.004 --> 16:13.404
that so many golfers
resort to throwing

16:13.406 --> 16:15.740
perfectly good equipment
into a lake.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.777
A man in the grip of obsession
knows no reason, Murdoch.
Sir,

16:19.779 --> 16:22.513
this one matches
Mr. Newsome's description.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.184
It has his initials
monogrammed in it.

16:29.054 --> 16:33.257
It appears to have been
underwater for some time,
undisturbed. I think we have

16:33.259 --> 16:35.727
to rule this out
as the murder weapon.
So Newsome's not our killer.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.895
Well, that's yet to be
determined, George.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.765
But this club didn't
kill Mr. Benedict.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.673
The victim was killed
in this wooded area here.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.708
Quicksand would be
roughly here.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.144
Mr. Newsome said
he entered the woods first.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.748
Driscoll and Sanders went
further down the fairway.
Even if one of the foursome

16:56.750 --> 16:59.283
is the killer, he would have had
to dispose of the murder weapon

16:59.285 --> 17:02.920
somewhere in that direction.
Maybe he dropped it into
someone's bag on the 16th.

17:02.922 --> 17:05.790
There's a pond on the 16th.
I nearly hit into it

17:05.792 --> 17:08.960
during my round with Mr. Ly--
Close enough

17:08.962 --> 17:11.896
for the killer to throw
something in there?

17:11.898 --> 17:14.966
Oh, sirs...

17:14.968 --> 17:18.169
Can I at least
get my trunks first?

17:20.105 --> 17:23.307
Six golf clubs, sir.
And a coat of slime.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.110
And that filthy water
from the lake in my ear.

17:26.112 --> 17:30.114
I swear I can feel the germs
making their way into my brain.

17:30.116 --> 17:33.117
Germs can be quite deadly,
can't they?
Yes.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.520
Really?

17:35.522 --> 17:39.390
Two putters...
both fairly rusty.

17:39.392 --> 17:42.660
And this.
That's quite unusual, sir.

17:42.662 --> 17:46.564
Is that a putter also?
Well, it does a flat face.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.002
But it's rather unwieldy,
though.

17:51.004 --> 17:54.539
Looks to be in good shape
though, sir. I wouldn't say
it's been in the water long.

17:54.541 --> 17:58.876
Indeed. I'll have Dr. Ogden
see if it's a match to
the victim's wound.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.653
It's fun, isn't it?
This part is fun.

18:08.655 --> 18:12.790
It's wandering around endlessly
after a tiny white ball that
doesn't seem so appealing.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.094
I prefer to look at it
as a pleasant walk in
a beautiful setting.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.163
I can do that in High Park.
For free.

18:19.165 --> 18:22.033
I believe we've found
our culprit.
Well,

18:22.035 --> 18:25.803
given its unique design,
someone at the club will know
who it belongs to.

18:25.805 --> 18:29.774
Then I suppose you'll be
sending a constable
to ask around?

18:29.776 --> 18:33.177
Oh, I was thinking I would
go myself. Mr. Lyon knows
everyone at the club.

18:33.179 --> 18:36.214
If I speak to him, I'll have
my answer directly.

18:36.216 --> 18:39.684
And if he happens to ask you
to play him in a round of golf?

18:39.686 --> 18:43.054
I'll have to check
the etiquette on that.

18:45.190 --> 18:49.060
Hit another, Detective.
It's only a friendly round.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.135
Ah-ah! I'll bend the rules
to grant you a mulligan,

18:57.137 --> 19:00.605
but the removal of loose
impediments is strictly
prohibited.

19:00.607 --> 19:04.342
Oh. Thank you, Mr. Lyon.

19:04.344 --> 19:08.813
The sheer volume of golf
etiquette is somewhat daunting.

19:08.815 --> 19:13.084
And as important
as the game itself.

19:13.086 --> 19:16.420
What of this putter?
Is it familiar to you?
I've seen it only once before.

19:16.422 --> 19:20.258
Odd piece of equipment,
isn't it? Even if it works,

19:20.260 --> 19:23.194
you look like
a fool using it.

19:23.196 --> 19:26.497
Did you happen to notice
who it belonged to?

19:26.499 --> 19:29.567
MacIver, a Scotsman.

19:29.569 --> 19:33.271
The daft man purchases every
newfangled thing that promises
the slightest improvement

19:33.273 --> 19:38.042
to his game. I'll telephone him
this afternoon and send him
straight over to you.

19:38.044 --> 19:41.078
Oh, and did you find out
who the beneficiary is

19:41.080 --> 19:44.615
of Mr. Benedict's
insurance policy?
Next of kin-in this case,

19:44.617 --> 19:49.220
his brother, Wilbur Benedict.
Also a member of this club,
I believe.

19:49.222 --> 19:52.957
Thank you, Mr. Lyon.

19:57.462 --> 19:59.397
Ah. Well, you'll get
the hang of it.

20:01.900 --> 20:04.202
I don't understand.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.205
I hit the ball perfectly before.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.740
Such is the nature
of the game,

20:09.742 --> 20:13.678
Detective, as unpredictable
as life itself.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.781
Of course, insurance
allows us to guard

20:16.783 --> 20:20.985
against life's calamity.
In golf, there are no
such assurances.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.554
A perfect swing
every time?

20:23.556 --> 20:27.058
That would be mastering
the unmasterable.

20:34.299 --> 20:38.436
What's this then?
Oh, sir.

20:38.438 --> 20:42.506
I've had an idea.
It's an invention.
What's it do?

20:42.508 --> 20:45.309
Force a man to confess?
(laughing)

20:45.311 --> 20:47.445
No. No.

20:47.447 --> 20:51.649
No. It will allow me to--
Give it a rest, and
get back to work.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.151
There's a churlish Scotsman
sitting in your office.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.454
Churlish? How so?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.723
Well, he's a Scotsman,
isn't he?

21:00.525 --> 21:04.595
Ah, <i>Practical Golf,</i>
<i>a tome as sacred</i>

21:04.597 --> 21:08.165
as the King James Bible, eh?
(laughing)

21:08.167 --> 21:12.036
Do you recognize this putter?
Aye, surely.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.071
Bought it two months ago.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.907
Useless as a fat man
at the high jump.
(laughing)

21:19.311 --> 21:22.213
This is your putter.
Not any longer, no.

21:22.215 --> 21:26.150
Sold it three weeks back.
To whom did you sell it?

21:26.152 --> 21:29.353
That right drunk
duffer, uh... Wilbur.

21:29.355 --> 21:32.957
<i>Wilbur Benedict.</i>

21:34.893 --> 21:38.562
Mr. Benedict. Detective
William Murdoch.
Yes, yes.

21:38.564 --> 21:42.300
What?
I'd like to speak with you

21:42.302 --> 21:46.037
regarding your brother's death.
Do you recognize this putter?

21:46.039 --> 21:49.573
Of course. What of it?
Does it belong to you?

21:49.575 --> 21:54.178
I have one just like it,
but mine is in my golf bag,
secured in my locker.

21:54.180 --> 22:00.117
Are you quite sure about that?
Because this is your golf bag
and there's no putter in it.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.787
And this was used to murder
your brother, Mr. Benedict.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.423
Let's take a walk,
shall we, sunshine.

22:18.570 --> 22:21.672
If someone used my putter

22:21.674 --> 22:25.576
to murder poor James,
it certainly had
nothing to do with me.

22:25.578 --> 22:30.114
Anyone could have taken it
from my locker, and I haven't
used my clubs in weeks.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.284
But you were at the clubhouse
every day.
The clubhouse.

22:33.286 --> 22:36.487
Not the course.
My physician told me
I have to stay off my hip,

22:36.489 --> 22:39.123
so I while my time at the bar.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.559
The perfect place
to lie in wait.

22:41.561 --> 22:44.228
The spot where your
brother was murdered

22:44.230 --> 22:47.631
is only a short distance away
the clubhouse's back door.

22:47.633 --> 22:50.901
You think I slipped out
between sherries

22:50.903 --> 22:53.738
to murder poor Jimmy boy?

22:53.740 --> 22:56.173
(laughing)
It's preposterous.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.777
Why would I do such a thing?
You're the beneficiary

22:59.779 --> 23:03.981
for his life insurance policy.
Oh, I am not.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.718
You deny it?
I used to be his beneficiary,

23:07.720 --> 23:12.189
but then Jimmy boy decided to
cancel his insurance last month.

23:12.191 --> 23:16.060
Hello? Detective?
Ah, Mr. Lyon!

23:16.062 --> 23:19.530
Thank you for coming.
My oh my...

23:19.532 --> 23:24.168
Whatever is this?
I call it my swing-arc
perfection device.

23:26.872 --> 23:30.641
As you can see, the device
helps to guide your backswing.

23:30.643 --> 23:32.977
Now, if you make an error,

23:32.979 --> 23:37.181
the device lets you know.
(clanking)

23:37.183 --> 23:40.751
Whereas if you keep the club
between the rails,

23:40.753 --> 23:44.355
you have a perfect swing.
It's quite clever, Detective.

23:44.357 --> 23:48.025
I'm not sure the likes
of George Lyon can benefit.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.896
My swing is already one
of the purest in the game.

23:51.898 --> 23:55.299
But is it perfect every time?

23:55.301 --> 23:58.536
Well... perhaps
not every time.

23:58.538 --> 24:02.973
This device ensures that your
swing will become consistent.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.910
Think of it as... insurance.

24:05.912 --> 24:07.545
(chuckling)

24:07.547 --> 24:12.249
Alright, alright.
Let's have a go. Thank you.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.987
(clanking)
Ah!
(laughing)

24:16.989 --> 24:20.724
The reason I asked you here
today, Mr. Lyon, was to discuss
James Benedict's

24:20.726 --> 24:24.829
insurance policy.
Yes.
We've come to learn

24:24.831 --> 24:27.698
that Mr. Benedict intended
to cancel the policy.
He certainly did.

24:27.700 --> 24:31.402
End of last month. Wanted
to cancel the whole lot.

24:31.404 --> 24:34.071
And why were
the policies not canceled?
I took him for a round

24:34.073 --> 24:37.107
and convinced him to reconsider.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.482
Ingenious!

24:44.484 --> 24:47.651
I can start to feel my swing
improving already.

24:49.554 --> 24:53.524
Afternoon, Miss James.
Is the doctor in?

24:53.526 --> 24:56.293
I'm afraid she's gone
for the day, Constable.

24:56.295 --> 25:00.297
Taking care of the little one.
Is there something
I can help you with?

25:00.299 --> 25:03.901
I actually do have a bit
of a medical issue.

25:03.903 --> 25:07.738
What seems to be the trouble?
I've got water

25:07.740 --> 25:10.374
stuck in my ear. And
not just any water--

25:10.376 --> 25:12.977
filthy, filthy
stagnant pond water.

25:12.979 --> 25:16.413
Rife with germs and microscopic
diseases, to be sure.

25:16.415 --> 25:19.884
Is that so?
Yes, that's so.

25:19.886 --> 25:23.387
I've reading up on it in
the library. You wouldn't
believe it. There are several

25:23.389 --> 25:27.791
recorded instances of dirty
water causing fatal infections.

25:27.793 --> 25:31.562
Every patient who looks up
their symptoms at the library
ends up thinking they're dying.

25:31.564 --> 25:35.566
Diagnosis is best left
to the professionals.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.801
That said,

25:37.803 --> 25:40.971
you might lose your ear.
What?!

25:41.907 --> 25:44.975
You-Oh, my goodness.

25:44.977 --> 25:48.312
It's gone. You've cured me!

25:48.314 --> 25:52.283
Rubbing alcohol and vinegar.
I learned it from my mother.

25:52.285 --> 25:55.653
For next time.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.856
Thank you, Miss James.

26:00.792 --> 26:05.362
It's possible Mr. Benedict
killed his brother
for the insurance.

26:05.364 --> 26:08.699
But it's also equally
possible that he knew

26:08.701 --> 26:13.437
about the policy being canceled.
You do realize you're missing
the obvious, Murdoch.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.372
Sir?
George Lyon.

26:15.374 --> 26:18.108
Your new pal.
He's the one with motive.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.244
He stands
to lose his commission

26:20.246 --> 26:23.147
if a policy is canceled before
the company can earn it back.

26:23.149 --> 26:27.017
Sir, you believe
Mr. Lyon failed to convince
Mr. Benedict to reconsider?

26:27.019 --> 26:30.020
And killed him
to stop him from canceling.
Must need the cash

26:30.022 --> 26:33.290
to go off gallivanting
to the Olympic games.
Sir,

26:33.292 --> 26:35.926
Mr. Lyon wasn't part of
the foursome on the course.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.028
And his cleats didn't match

26:38.030 --> 26:41.131
the marks on the body.
It can't be him.

26:41.133 --> 26:46.070
You're off to play
with Lyon now, I presume?
As a matter of fact, I am.

26:48.873 --> 26:52.876
You don't think your personal
feelings about the man are
clouding your judgment, do you?

26:52.878 --> 26:55.512
Absolutely not.

26:55.514 --> 26:58.716
Good.
Good.

27:15.033 --> 27:18.435
Crabtree. Come here.
I need your help.

27:18.437 --> 27:22.506
What's the problem, sir?
Murdoch has bungled this
golf club murder.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.075
How so?
He's fallen in love
with the game.

27:25.077 --> 27:28.412
The temptress has blinded him.
Thinks George Lyon can do
no wrong.

27:28.414 --> 27:31.548
You think Mr. Lyon
is guilty, then?
I don't know.

27:31.550 --> 27:35.753
When did you check the pattern
on his golf cleats? Do you think
he could have changed them?

27:38.356 --> 27:42.226
Sir, Mr. Lyon's cleats were
never checked. He was out on
the course with the Detective

27:42.228 --> 27:46.764
and never came back
to the clubhouse.
The bugger swerved it.

27:46.766 --> 27:50.501
Let's go, Crabtree.

27:52.704 --> 27:56.774
Where was Lyon when Benedict
went into the woods?
Hard to say.

27:56.776 --> 28:01.145
He was playing as a single
and asked to play through
at some point.

28:01.147 --> 28:05.382
Yes, yes, that's right.
I remember noticing his
plus fours. I thought:

28:05.384 --> 28:07.918
"I would look
quite fine in those,"

28:07.920 --> 28:10.587
and went straight out to buy
myself a pair that afternoon.

28:10.589 --> 28:13.023
The afternoon
your friend was murdered.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.260
I purchased them whilst
carrying the heaviest of hearts.

28:16.262 --> 28:19.930
Oh yes, I'm sure you were
just devastated. What hole
did you see him on?

28:19.932 --> 28:24.501
Constable Crabtree,
do I sense sarcasm?
Shut up, Newsome.

28:24.503 --> 28:28.472
Where were you on the course
when you saw Lyon?
I don't remember.

28:28.474 --> 28:31.475
It was the hole that Sanders
yelled at Benedict. Sanders,

28:31.477 --> 28:34.945
what hole was that?
Yelling at the victim?
What about?

28:34.947 --> 28:39.149
He was cleaning his ball.
And?

28:39.151 --> 28:43.320
It was during play. And
as such, strictly prohibited.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.657
Oh, for the love of Ada.
Which hole was it?
The 13th.

28:46.659 --> 28:49.059
He claimed
Ground Under Repair,

28:49.061 --> 28:51.795
but the circumstances
called for no relief.
13th?

28:51.797 --> 28:55.766
Benedict was killed on the 14th.
That's right.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.635
Come on, Crabtree.
Constable Crabtree,

28:58.637 --> 29:02.940
I must know what I've done.
We've been through
so much together.

29:02.942 --> 29:06.877
Why don't you
like me? Why?

29:06.879 --> 29:09.813
You left me for dead.
I did what?

29:09.815 --> 29:13.684
Your cohort from the auto club
had his hands around my neck
throttling me.

29:13.686 --> 29:16.286
You fled in abject cowardice.

29:16.288 --> 29:20.157
I thought you had the
situation in hand.
Ugh!

29:20.159 --> 29:22.526
I was begging for your help!

29:22.528 --> 29:25.295
You just turned around and left.
My God, what kind of man

29:25.297 --> 29:29.366
could just turn around and--
(sighing)

29:32.337 --> 29:35.305
Blast!

29:35.307 --> 29:39.176
Blast, blast, blast!

29:39.178 --> 29:43.180
Are you all right, Mr. Lyon?
No! I'm not all right,
Detective.

29:43.182 --> 29:47.451
Your damnable contraption
has given me the yips!
The yips?

29:47.453 --> 29:51.488
The yips. I set up perfectly.
I swing perfectly.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.358
And yet, every time,
disaster!

29:54.360 --> 29:56.493
I hardly think a machine
can be held responsible--

29:56.495 --> 29:58.529
I may never win another
golf game again!

29:58.531 --> 30:02.332
Not here, certainly not in
St. Louis, at the Olympic games,

30:02.334 --> 30:05.002
whilst representing
the fine people of Canada!

30:05.004 --> 30:08.705
Murdoch, you look like
a damn fool in those knickers.

30:08.707 --> 30:11.141
Sir? What
are you doing here?

30:11.143 --> 30:14.077
He was just ahead
of the foursome when Benedict
went into the woods.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.713
He could have seen him
and he could have killed him.

30:16.715 --> 30:19.550
But, sir, Mr. Lyon's
cleats are not a match.

30:19.552 --> 30:22.953
Mr. Lyon didn't have
his cleats checked. You didn't
go back to the clubhouse

30:22.955 --> 30:26.056
after your round, did you?
Why would I? I had
an engagement.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.959
Or you saw what the constable
was doing in there and
you buggered off.

30:30.361 --> 30:34.097
Mr. Lyon, I need
to see your shoe.

30:34.099 --> 30:38.769
Is this because I insulted
your contraption?
Your shoe.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.581
George Lyon.

30:50.583 --> 30:53.116
You're under arrest for the
murder of James Benedict.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.862
There's one thing
still bothering me.

31:04.864 --> 31:08.899
We know that
Wilbur Benedict's putter

31:08.901 --> 31:12.736
was the murder weapon. But no
one was seen with it that day;

31:12.738 --> 31:16.139
that means it had to have been
stashed in the woods

31:16.141 --> 31:18.675
ahead of time.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.245
So, the killer had to have known

31:21.247 --> 31:25.449
that Benedict would go
into those woods.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.952
But how could George Lyon
have known that?

31:28.954 --> 31:31.955
How could anyone
have known that?

31:31.957 --> 31:35.959
(babbling)
I have no idea either.

31:45.169 --> 31:48.005
Oh, that's odd.

32:01.519 --> 32:06.023
Now, what do you suppose is
wrong with this, little fellow?

32:06.025 --> 32:09.693
That ball was amongst the ones
that George had found
in the lake.

32:09.695 --> 32:13.597
It's possible that
it was just a bad ball.

32:13.599 --> 32:17.601
But it's also possible that
it was weighted on purpose.

32:17.603 --> 32:20.537
And if one ball was
weighted on purpose,

32:20.539 --> 32:24.207
it's possible
that others were also.

32:24.209 --> 32:27.477
Like the one that James Benedict

32:27.479 --> 32:30.480
hit into the woods.

32:32.216 --> 32:35.552
A bunch of golf balls that
don't work right. So?
Sir,

32:35.554 --> 32:39.756
I cut one of those open.
They weren't manufactured
by accident.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.159
They were finely designed

32:42.161 --> 32:44.962
to veer off course
when hit squarely.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.764
All right.
So Lyon gives Benedict

32:47.766 --> 32:50.867
this special ball. He knows
that every time he uses it

32:50.869 --> 32:53.670
he'll end up in the woods. So he
goes in there and waits for him.

32:53.672 --> 32:55.839
Except that it wasn't
George Lyon.

32:55.841 --> 32:58.008
Are you sure?
Yes, I am.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.210
The victim would have
noticed a weighted ball

33:00.212 --> 33:03.914
while putting on the 13th green;
therefore, the exchange

33:03.916 --> 33:07.751
had to have happened
between there and
teeing off on the 14th.

33:07.753 --> 33:13.023
And George Lyon wasn't there.
The killer had to have been
part of the victim's foursome.

33:13.025 --> 33:16.460
Ah, Mr. Lyon.
I'm terribly sorry--

33:16.462 --> 33:19.062
Ah, ah. I don't want to hear
a word of it. You did
what you had to do

33:19.064 --> 33:22.265
in the pursuit of justice.

33:22.267 --> 33:26.136
Thank you for understanding.
While we have you here,

33:26.138 --> 33:29.272
I believe you might be able to
assist us in our investigation.

33:29.274 --> 33:32.876
Oh?
This ball was made
to veer off course.

33:36.014 --> 33:39.216
My, my, my. How unusual.
Do you know of anyone

33:39.218 --> 33:42.853
who would be able to
manufacture such a thing?
I know just the man.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.593
Virgil Graydon?

33:49.595 --> 33:52.095
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

33:52.097 --> 33:56.366
I understand you manufacture
sporting goods?
In all manner, sir: cleeks,

33:56.368 --> 34:00.804
mashies, niblicks,
carry bags, rubber tees...

34:00.806 --> 34:03.907
A teeing pedestal
made of rubber and wood,

34:03.909 --> 34:07.811
how ingenious.
Never mind all of that.

34:07.813 --> 34:13.150
I'm here to discuss
golf balls. Specifically--
I have several new models.

34:13.152 --> 34:16.186
But if you're after
something truly special,

34:16.188 --> 34:19.456
you'll want The Monarch.
Oh my.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.758
These appear to be--

34:21.760 --> 34:25.262
Extra dimples. For maximum
distance off the tee.

34:25.264 --> 34:29.166
Dimples would cause
turbulence, but that shouldn't
result in greater distance...

34:29.168 --> 34:31.535
I'm sure you're happy
with your Haskells.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.104
I'll take
a box of each.

34:34.106 --> 34:36.506
Now, have you ever
been commissioned

34:36.508 --> 34:40.444
to make custom balls for
any of the club members?
It happens on occasion.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.080
Well, on this occasion,
the balls in question

34:43.082 --> 34:46.149
were specifically engineered
to veer off course.

34:48.653 --> 34:51.321
I know the balls exist,
Mr. Graydon.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.357
If you do not tell me
who commissioned them,

34:54.359 --> 34:57.961
I'll be forced to charge you
with impeding a murder
investigation.

34:59.430 --> 35:04.101
Me? A murderer?
(laughing)
What a preposterous notion!

35:09.907 --> 35:14.111
Where did you get this?
It was found near
James Benedict's body.

35:14.113 --> 35:18.315
You gave Benedict that ball.
You knew what would happen
when he hit it.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.550
You had planned to
follow him into the woods,

35:20.552 --> 35:23.487
where you had previously
planted the golf club,

35:23.489 --> 35:26.089
and murder your friend
in cold blood.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.629
Well? Speak up. What do you
have to say for yourself?

35:34.665 --> 35:37.367
I have nothing to say,

35:37.369 --> 35:41.671
Inspector, except
that you have it right.

35:41.673 --> 35:46.042
This ball was
intended for murder.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.079
And I am a murderer.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.884
I hereby honourably
admit my guilt.

35:55.620 --> 35:58.622
I never did like that little
git. Glad we don't have to come
across him any longer.

35:58.624 --> 36:01.224
I'm sure George feels
much the same way.

36:01.226 --> 36:04.427
Well, Crabtree?
Oh, it's all right.

36:04.429 --> 36:07.931
You're allowed to take some joy
in the misfortune of others
every now and again.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.400
Sir, I would like to.
It's just...

36:10.402 --> 36:13.069
(sighing)
I don't think Newsome is guilty.

36:13.071 --> 36:16.573
He's confessed.
I think he's lying.
Why?

36:16.575 --> 36:21.244
He's embarrassed
to admit the truth.
What truth would that be?

36:21.246 --> 36:26.116
That he's a cheater. That's
what the weighted balls are for.
George. You think Mr. Newsome

36:26.118 --> 36:29.386
confessed to a murder in
order to cover up the fact
that he cheats at golf?

36:29.388 --> 36:32.422
Yes.
That would be mad.

36:32.424 --> 36:34.558
Yes.
He could be right, Murdoch.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.793
That twit values his pride
over everything.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.763
I was once ready to hang him
over a bloody maths puzzle.

36:39.765 --> 36:43.300
But Mr. Newsome's account
of the events is consistent
with the facts as we know them.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.236
Except Newsome claims he only
used the weighted ball
for the murder,

36:46.238 --> 36:48.305
but we found another
in the lake.

36:48.307 --> 36:52.842
That's true. But how
would a weighted ball
help his golf game?

36:58.015 --> 37:00.850
Fine putt, old man.

37:03.087 --> 37:05.388
Toss.

37:12.897 --> 37:16.566
He used it to sabotage
the other players.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.002
If Driscoll or Sanders found
out what he was doing?
Then one of them

37:19.004 --> 37:21.438
could have used the tampered
ball to commit the murder.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.373
Daft bloody game.

37:33.117 --> 37:35.151
Afternoon, gentlemen.

37:35.153 --> 37:37.354
Inspector. Detective.

37:37.356 --> 37:41.791
To what do we owe the pleasure?
How is old Roger faring?

37:41.793 --> 37:45.662
A murderer.
Doesn't that beat all?
He didn't do it.

37:45.664 --> 37:49.366
New information
has come to light.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.337
Oh well, I'm--

37:59.677 --> 38:01.811
Make way!

38:07.952 --> 38:10.687
(exclamations)

38:10.689 --> 38:14.457
Still got my swing,
me old mucker.

38:19.397 --> 38:23.533
I'll need you to empty
your pockets. I must ask.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.236
Why did you do it,
Mr. Sanders?

38:26.238 --> 38:29.172
Because he wouldn't listen.

38:29.174 --> 38:32.709
I told him and told him
and he kept doing it.

38:32.711 --> 38:36.246
Doing what?
Cleaning his ball.

38:36.248 --> 38:40.650
During play.
I may be a novice,
Mr. Sanders,

38:40.652 --> 38:44.688
but to my eye, the cleaning
of one's ball seems
a minor infraction.

38:44.690 --> 38:48.358
Mr. Newsome's transgressions
are far greater.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.995
(scoffing)
Newsome is a fool
who never wins a single round.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.431
Benedict liked to win,

38:54.433 --> 38:58.668
he gloried in his victory
every chance he got.
And when I cried foul,

38:58.670 --> 39:02.772
he accused me of being
a poor sport. Me!

39:02.774 --> 39:06.242
You murdered a man
over a breach of etiquette.

39:06.244 --> 39:08.912
Hardly the definition
of a gracious competitor.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.214
Golf is a game of order.

39:11.216 --> 39:14.017
Without order,
what do we have?

39:14.019 --> 39:18.388
Without order, we have
nothing. Constable.

39:18.390 --> 39:21.358
Take him away.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.831
(kissing sounds)

39:29.767 --> 39:33.703
Mr. Newsome.
Oh. Constable Crabtree.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.473
Thank you for coming.

39:36.475 --> 39:40.710
As I am fated to die, there is
something you must know.

39:40.712 --> 39:44.447
I did abandon you that day.
I know I can never
make it up to you.

39:44.449 --> 39:47.317
But I hope you can
find some solace

39:47.319 --> 39:51.788
that the Lord has chosen you
to live, and seen fit
for me to die.

39:51.790 --> 39:54.157
You're not going
to die, Mr. Newsome.

39:54.159 --> 39:57.861
You mean...
you know the truth?

39:57.863 --> 40:00.463
And against my better
judgment, I spoke up.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.266
The club doesn't know

40:03.268 --> 40:06.035
about my cheating, do they?
I'll try not to mention it.

40:07.972 --> 40:12.308
You're a fine man,
Constable. If any good

40:12.310 --> 40:15.211
is to come of James' death, I'm
glad for it to be the salvation

40:15.213 --> 40:20.083
of our friendship.
Don't push it, Newsome.
Right-o. But really,

40:20.085 --> 40:23.019
I must make it up to you.
You'll have to come out to
the house for supper sometime.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.288
Mother would
simply adore you.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.992
Oh! Perhaps you can court my
sister. She's quite the beauty.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.594
We have
the same profile.

40:40.671 --> 40:44.774
It's all over, Detective.
I cannot shake these yips.

40:44.776 --> 40:48.912
Perhaps we simply
didn't use the swing
machine enough, is all.

40:57.988 --> 41:02.058
It's no use. My dream
of the Olympic Games is dead.

41:02.060 --> 41:04.494
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Julia.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.697
I was able to leave Roland
with Miss James for
the afternoon.

41:07.699 --> 41:11.534
And you've decided to join us?
Welcome. I'm afraid we won't be

41:11.536 --> 41:14.804
very good company,

41:14.806 --> 41:18.274
but give it a go, Doctor.
(giggling excitedly)

41:18.276 --> 41:20.810
Now Julia,
you'll want to align

41:20.812 --> 41:23.813
your left shoulder
with your forward foot

41:23.815 --> 41:28.284
and angle at the waist--
Oh William, don't bother.
I don't expect to be any good,

41:28.286 --> 41:32.522
I just came to play
to have a little fun.

41:32.524 --> 41:34.491
Oh!

41:37.027 --> 41:41.231
(laughing)
Well, that is fun!
How did you do that?

41:41.233 --> 41:44.434
I don't know. I just did it.
Yes, but what were you
thinking?

41:44.436 --> 41:46.769
Were you focused on the ball
or the club or--

41:46.771 --> 41:49.572
I was thinking
of nothing, Mr. Lyon.

41:49.574 --> 41:51.875
Surely you were
thinking of something.

41:51.877 --> 41:55.411
No.
I just emptied my mind.

41:55.413 --> 41:59.549
Emptying your mind.

41:59.551 --> 42:03.019
Emptying your mind.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.862
Ooh!
Yes!

42:12.864 --> 42:16.399
By Jove, dear lady,
I do believe you've saved me.

42:16.401 --> 42:18.701
I'm glad to have been
some help!

42:33.617 --> 42:37.253
Ugh! I am doing it
properly. I know I am!

42:37.255 --> 42:40.623
Empty your mind, Detective.
It works, it really works.

42:40.625 --> 42:43.293
Ha! Empty your mind?

42:43.295 --> 42:47.430
That simply doesn't make
any sense. How does one
empty their mind?

42:47.432 --> 42:49.999
It's impossible.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.068
May I have another?
