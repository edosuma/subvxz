08:01.369 --> 08:04.440
I'm guessing these gates thrill them.

Go down to the armory,
get everything you can.

08:24.344 --> 08:28.179
Is this enough? I hope you don't
mind, Sheriff, I took some initiative.

08:28.215 --> 08:31.266
Figured there was no time to waste.

08:31.301 --> 08:34.302
You're the guy who gave
me your resume, right?

08:34.304 --> 08:37.438
- Dade County Sheriff's Department.
- Yes, sir. Kurt Bunker.

08:37.474 --> 08:40.140
How the hell did you get
into our gun locker, Bunker?

08:40.605 --> 08:42.610
I smashed the lock.

08:43.647 --> 08:45.313
- You're hired.
- What?

08:45.315 --> 08:47.115
- Thank you, sir.
- Get those guns handed out.

08:47.150 --> 08:48.450
- Seriously... Hood...
- What?

08:48.485 --> 08:50.535
- What about Mr. Proctor?
- What about him?

08:50.690 --> 08:52.949
Keeping him in that cell is
a violation of a civil liberty.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.456
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.

08:54.491 --> 08:56.157
- Sheriff, are you gnna let him out or not?
- Not.

08:56.209 --> 08:59.294
Okay, so the sheriff is willfully
endangering the life of my client.

08:59.329 --> 09:01.162
You're an officer of the court.
Do something.

09:01.164 --> 09:04.666
- This is a war zone, Counselor.
- Due process just got blown up.

09:04.718 --> 09:08.336
Hey, Sperling, I got an idea.
Why don't you go down the basement?

09:08.388 --> 09:11.006
I'm not fuckining anywhere
with without Mr. Proctor.

09:11.058 --> 09:14.843
- Okay, Bunker, give him a gun.
- What? Why?

09:14.845 --> 09:18.847
- Time to make yourself useful.
- I don't know how to shoot that thing.

09:18.899 --> 09:20.682
Well, neither do I, 
but it's not gonna stop me.

09:20.684 --> 09:23.395
- Ma'am, that gun packs a powerful kick.
- Are you gonna

09:23.396 --> 09:25.820
stand there like a total
misogynist and patronize me,

09:25.856 --> 09:28.573
or are you gonna show me
how to shoot the damn thing?

09:28.608 --> 09:31.609
Thank you. I just felt married again.
All right, here we go.

Hood, the basement.

09:39.119 --> 09:42.537
- What about it?
- The exterior doors don't have gates on them.

09:42.589 --> 09:47.935
- Bunker, through the range down the stairs.
- I'm on it. Sir.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.630
- Alison, with him...
- I'm not going anywhere with that guy.

09:52.682 --> 09:55.410
With all due respect, ma'am,
I understand my physical

09:55.411 --> 09:59.020
- appearance may be alarming...
- Save it. I've known men like you.

09:59.056 --> 10:02.690
- I know everything about you.
- Hey, if you want to help people,

10:02.726 --> 10:04.476
there's people down
there who need your help.

10:04.528 --> 10:06.027
Then let the Nazi calm them down.

10:06.063 --> 10:12.283
- I'm asking you.
- Fine. But keep your distance

10:12.319 --> 10:15.370
and I am new with this thing,
so it might just accidentally go off.

10:15.405 --> 10:18.706
- [sighs] Fair enough?
- Yes, sir.

10:21.795 --> 10:25.580
- Citizens secure in the basement.
- What do we do now?

10:30.170 --> 10:33.505
All right, spread out, settle in.

hasn't forgotten that night

died if not of my intervention.

- Is that right?

12:44.784 --> 12:47.330

12:48.416 --> 12:53.419
- You leave now, I'll let you live.
- We are coming in there, cop.

more Redbones are gonna die.

26:23.230 --> 26:26.314
My father was the
biggest man I ever knew.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.536
He beat me a lot when I was a kid,

And every time he saw me, he would
sit me down and buy me a soda.

Tell me that I had the
power to change things.

26:59.182 --> 27:02.734

would never do it again.

"Your boy is one of us now."

27:44.144 --> 27:47.755
My father never laid a hand on me again.

27:49.656 --> 27:55.815

- Because we need all the help we can get.</i>

No, no, no. I don't want his help.
I don't need his help.

have to fight your battles.

I did this job by the book.

29:58.194 --> 30:01.112
I put in my time, I sacrificed
my marriage for this job

I'm good at being a cop.

doesn't make you right for this job.
