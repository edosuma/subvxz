01:23.900 --> 01:25.500
And so?

01:25.700 --> 01:28.000
And so,
I'm sitting there staring at him, right?

01:28.100 --> 01:31.300
He tells me to get my crunchy
fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.900
You believe that shit?

01:33.100 --> 01:35.500
- You know what I said, right?
- No, what did you say?

01:38.800 --> 01:41.300
- Shit. "Okay."
- You fucking said, "Okay."

01:41.500 --> 01:43.000
I'm sure you did.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.900
<i>Control Center,</i>
<i>this is Stillwell 1215.</i>

02:11.300 --> 02:12.700
Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.200
I'm about four cars
out of 57th Street station...

02:15.400 --> 02:17.100
...being delayed
by a red signal light.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.000
Should be green, Stillwell 1215.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.300
Yeah, tell me something
I don't already know.

02:24.100 --> 02:27.300
All right, roll through it slow,
extreme caution, per the rulebook.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.200
Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet
from the east end of the platform.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.900
It's the goddamn cold.
Metal contracts, you know that.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.200
I got it, I got it.
How long it take to fix it?

02:47.400 --> 02:49.400
Gotta put a plate on it. Two hours.

02:50.700 --> 02:53.400
Thank you. Make it an hour and a half,
I'll buy you a beer.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.700
Shit, G.B. I hate to see you
down here on the floor, man.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.500
Temporary, baby. I'll be up there
behind the glass before you know it.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.200
I'm gonna need the R train...

03:45.400 --> 03:47.700
...to switch over
to the express tracks at 34th.

03:47.900 --> 03:49.900
- Which express tracks?
- The one that Q uses.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.100
Once they exit the 57th Street,
they can switch over to the F Line.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.400
Straight into Queens.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.000
Once they get to Queens, they switch
back at 36th Street to the R Line.

03:58.200 --> 04:02.400
All you gotta do, suspend the W,
N and R will pick up the slack.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.000
I can't see where I gotta look.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.600
Unlock the door.
Do it now or I'll kill you. Do it.

04:53.700 --> 04:54.700
All right, all right.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.000
Shut up and walk.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.500
First car, go.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
See? I told you I could do this.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.900
Big fucking deal,
you did what you said you'd do.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.700
All right.

05:53.900 --> 05:56.300
Five minutes of peace.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.600
- Yeah!
- Nice!

06:02.800 --> 06:04.700
- Nice.
- All right.

06:04.800 --> 06:06.400
There you go.

06:11.800 --> 06:13.600
I'm on the train and I still got you.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.100
- <i>You still got me?</i>
- I got you. What are you doing?

06:17.300 --> 06:19.200
<i>You still got me?</i>

06:20.500 --> 06:22.700
Oh, my God.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.100
Baby? Baby?

07:25.400 --> 07:26.700
Give me the cutting key.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.100
Cutting key.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.000
Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Come in, Pelham 123.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.100
Why did you stop?
You're all green ahead.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.400
<i>Control Center calling Pelham 123.</i>

08:00.200 --> 08:02.700
<i>Control Center calling Pelham 123.</i>

08:03.100 --> 08:05.100
<i>Why did you stop, 123?</i>
<i>You got green ahead.</i>

08:05.300 --> 08:07.100
It's okay.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.300
Life is simple now.

08:10.500 --> 08:12.800
You just gotta do what I say.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.300
Not now, okay?

08:34.500 --> 08:35.700
Where are you from?

08:37.200 --> 08:39.500
- Brooklyn.
- You Irish?

08:40.100 --> 08:41.100
Yeah.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.900
I thought so.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.600
Who's driving Pelham 123?

08:51.400 --> 08:53.100
Maybe something fell on the tracks.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.200
Wait. Are we going backwards?

09:56.700 --> 09:59.100
42nd Street tower,
I got a train wrong-railing...

09:59.300 --> 10:02.200
...on the southbound Lexington
Avenue Line just north of you.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.600
Listen up,
we need to stop and stay in-station.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.900
All southbound locals
just north of the 51 st Street station.

10:10.100 --> 10:12.800
The operator on 123
is Jerry Pollard.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.900
I know Jerry Pollard.
I went to motorman school with Jerry.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.700
Pelham 123,
come in to me, Pelham 123.

10:19.900 --> 10:22.400
Pelham 123, Jerry Pollard,
what's going on down there?

10:22.500 --> 10:25.800
<i>This is Control Center.</i>
<i>What's going on, 123?</i>

10:28.000 --> 10:31.800
Get an express train to go alongside
them, see what we see in the cab.

10:31.900 --> 10:35.400
<i>Yeah, this is South Ferry 105. I can't</i>
<i>get my windshield wiper to turn on.</i>

10:35.600 --> 10:39.000
South Ferry 105, there's a circuit
breaker right behind you for that.

10:39.200 --> 10:40.500
What's going on?

10:40.700 --> 10:42.500
Maestro, what's going on?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
- Cop.
- Excuse me.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.600
- Fuck.
- Watch your backs. Watch your backs.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.200
When I say stop, stop it hard.

11:10.400 --> 11:11.900
- Transit Police.
- Stop.

11:25.100 --> 11:26.600
Everybody sit the fuck down!

11:28.800 --> 11:29.900
Down!

11:30.800 --> 11:32.000
Sit the fuck down!

11:32.200 --> 11:34.800
<i>Jesus! We're getting reports</i>
<i>of gunshots down the tunnel.</i>

11:35.000 --> 11:36.300
Sergeant Moran.

11:36.500 --> 11:39.000
- Delgado, let's call off that express.
- Got it.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.800
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna fucking die, man.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Come on! Hey.

11:46.200 --> 11:49.000
Everybody up! By the window!
Come on, up, up, up!

11:49.100 --> 11:50.800
Stand up! Stand up! Come on!

11:54.500 --> 11:57.000
Move it! Against the window!

11:58.300 --> 12:00.200
What the fuck is going on?

12:00.300 --> 12:02.700
<i>There was a cop. Bashkin shot him.</i>

12:02.800 --> 12:04.600
I think... I think he's dead.

12:04.800 --> 12:07.200
Put Bashkin on
and find your fucking guts!

12:07.300 --> 12:09.500
- <i>Do it!</i>
- Fuck.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.900
- <i>What happened?</i>
- A cop. He's dead.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.500
Put the conductor on.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.300
- <i>What's your name, conductor?</i>
- Regina.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.000
Regina, baby, listen,
you got a job to do, honey.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.200
A job?

12:23.400 --> 12:26.300
God put you on this Earth
for one thing and one thing only.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.400
You conduct those people
off the train...

12:28.600 --> 12:31.100
...up to the platform.
You got that? Let me hear it.

12:31.300 --> 12:32.800
<i>Let me hear you do that.</i>

12:34.900 --> 12:36.000
Listen up, everybody.

12:36.100 --> 12:39.900
We're gonna go back to the platform.
I need everybody to...

12:40.100 --> 12:41.300
<i>Regina. Let's do it again.</i>

12:41.500 --> 12:42.800
Conduct those people.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.000
Listen. Now, we're gonna head back
towards the platform.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.000
I want everybody to slowly get up.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.500
- <i>I'm gonna get you off this train.</i>
- Good.

12:51.700 --> 12:55.500
Now, we're gonna be on the tracks,
so if you don't need it, leave it.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.000
<i>Have been put on alert regarding</i>...

13:09.200 --> 13:12.100
Right here, right here.
Right here, right here.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.900
Cross right here, right here.

13:14.100 --> 13:17.700
- Go.
- Cross over right here, right here.

13:17.800 --> 13:18.900
Let's go.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.300
- Up the stairs, up the stairs.
- Here you go.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.500
- Every cop in the city is on the way.
- Maybe it wasn't gunshots.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.100
Train could be blowing breakers.
Or the motor blew?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.500
No, this is on purpose.

13:30.300 --> 13:31.700
Fuck you.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.000
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Get the fuck off the walls.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.200
Shut the fuck up and come on.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.900
Shit. Come on.

13:39.900 --> 13:43.600
Ramos.
Turn the power off from there down.

13:43.800 --> 13:44.900
What?

13:45.000 --> 13:47.300
Turn the power off from there down!

13:47.500 --> 13:49.600
Okay, I got it!

13:52.400 --> 13:54.200
My fucking lucky day.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.500
Shit.
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

14:16.200 --> 14:20.200
<i>Pelham 123 to Rail Control Center.</i>
<i>Do you read me?</i>

14:22.500 --> 14:24.200
Yes, I read you, Pelham 123.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.100
This is Control Center. Who is this?

14:28.200 --> 14:32.100
It's me, man. I didn't wanna call
till everything was ready.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.800
- It's not Jerry.
- I don't know who it is.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.700
I understand, I understand,
Pelham 123.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.000
Who the hell is this?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.400
This is the man
who's gonna rock this city.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.400
This is the man who's gonna
give the city a run for the money.

14:45.600 --> 14:48.600
<i>Look up. Look up at your screen</i>
<i>and you tell me what you see.</i>

14:48.800 --> 14:50.700
<i>You see what I've done?</i>

14:50.900 --> 14:51.900
I see it.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.100
One car is much more manageable
than 10 with the manpower I got.

14:55.300 --> 14:58.100
Motorman's gonna tell you
about it. Tell him what we got.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.900
They got hostages, lots of them.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.600
- <i>And they got machine guns.</i>
- That's Jerry.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.600
- That's Jerry.
- <i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

15:04.800 --> 15:06.400
Check me,
do you understand that?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.300
I check, I understand.

15:11.800 --> 15:13.300
Didn't I tell you to knock first?

15:14.400 --> 15:17.500
<i>Good, because this is what we call</i>
<i>a cash transaction.</i>

15:17.600 --> 15:20.000
Now, you understand commodities,
don't you?

15:20.500 --> 15:23.200
You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?

15:23.300 --> 15:27.800
Listen, no disrespect, but maybe I'm
not the guy you should be talking to.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.200
Oh, no, you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.000
Now, I want you to look at the ticker
and you tell me...

15:33.200 --> 15:36.600
...what is the going rate
for a New York City hostage today?

15:38.400 --> 15:41.500
<i>You think a million dollars</i>
<i>is too much? I do. I think it's corny.</i>

15:41.700 --> 15:44.100
Now get your calculator out.
You got one?

15:47.800 --> 15:50.400
- <i>Do you have a calculator?</i>
- Yeah, we got one. I got one.

15:50.500 --> 15:56.200
Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,315 and 79 cents.

15:56.300 --> 16:00.000
<i>That's 526,315. 79.</i>

16:01.400 --> 16:03.000
<i>Now, times that by 19.</i>

16:03.100 --> 16:04.300
What do you got?

16:04.500 --> 16:06.800
What is he, a goddamn accountant?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.900
- That's 10 million?
- What do you got?

16:12.400 --> 16:15.100
That comes out to 10 million
plus one cent.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.200
That is a deal.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.700
You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.900
<i>And then you tell him I want it in</i>
<i>100,000 $ 100 bills, you got that?</i>

16:23.200 --> 16:24.800
I got it. What about the one cent?

16:25.000 --> 16:26.700
Keep that, that's your broker fee.

16:26.900 --> 16:29.800
Now, I want the rest
in plain suitcases...

16:30.000 --> 16:33.100
...the kind with the wheels
and the portable handle, okay?

16:33.300 --> 16:36.400
Now, this is not a futures contract.
This is a spot trade.

16:36.600 --> 16:39.600
<i>That means there's a time limit on it.</i>
<i>Okay, you got that?</i>

16:39.800 --> 16:42.000
Now, what do you think
is a fair time limit?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.900
You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy...

16:47.100 --> 16:50.100
Come on, give me a time limit.
Give me a fair time limit.

16:52.900 --> 16:55.000
- Thursday.
- I was thinking more like an hour.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.800
Now, what's your watch say?

16:58.900 --> 17:00.000
Two-thirteen.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.000
Oh,
that's exactly what my watch says.

17:02.100 --> 17:05.300
So at 3:13, I want that money here,
motherfucker.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.800
<i>And after that, there is a late fee.</i>

17:09.000 --> 17:11.400
What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.599
<i>Come on, tell me what it'll be.</i>

17:17.300 --> 17:20.099
You're gonna kill the passengers?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.200
Oh, commodities
is what I start to kill.

17:22.400 --> 17:25.200
One for every minute
past the deadline I am forced to wait.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.099
They become more valuable
this way...

17:27.300 --> 17:28.800
...and still at the same price.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.700
He's underground.
He's never gonna pull this off.

17:31.900 --> 17:34.500
- Don't tell me, tell him.
- Who the hell is this guy?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.200
- I don't know who it is!
- Garber, just stay with it.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.900
What's your name?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.900
- What's your name, my man?
- My name?

17:41.500 --> 17:43.100
What's your name?

17:44.400 --> 17:45.600
Tell him?

17:47.100 --> 17:48.400
- Garber.
- Garber, okay.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.300
Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes...

17:50.500 --> 17:52.200
...l'm gonna start killing passengers.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.700
So my advice to you is to get on
the phone, get the mayor notified now.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.600
Listen, I mean...

17:57.700 --> 18:00.800
I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.400
That's your problem, not mine.

18:02.500 --> 18:05.900
It's like, who's responsible for
who lives and who dies in New York?

18:06.100 --> 18:07.500
<i>That's New York City's problem.</i>

18:07.700 --> 18:11.700
Get the fuck off the radio
and notify the mayor, motherfucker!

18:13.700 --> 18:15.400
Okay.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.800
Nine months of this and I'm free.
Next mayor gets inaugurated...

18:28.000 --> 18:31.000
...l'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez
on the beach with a piña colada.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.600
I will never have to ride the subway
ever again.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.700
- Never say never, sir.
- Never.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.100
All right,
what's next for the afternoon?

18:39.300 --> 18:40.800
East Harlem Elementary at 2:30.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.500
You're to read
<i>The Cat In The Hat</i> to the third grade.

18:43.700 --> 18:47.000
Every time I go to the schools,
I get sick. They all have runny noses.

18:47.100 --> 18:50.800
Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him
waiting at the school, with a flu shot.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.700
Mayor's office.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.500
- He's in Car 3.
- Yeah.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.400
What happened?

19:16.800 --> 19:18.800
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.400
It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51 st and 42nd.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.200
Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.000
It's unclear, but I have a car
waiting for us downstairs.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.800
Subway will get us there faster.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.800
All right. Let the doors close.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.500
Tell them we'll meet them
at 59th Street.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.700
Tell the conductor
this is now an express.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.000
- We're skipping the next five stops.
- What?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
- I gotta get to work.
- Hold on, hold on.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.900
Everybody will get where they
need to go, we'll make all the stops.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.600
Maybe he's not such a douchebag
after all, huh?

19:52.900 --> 19:54.000
Funny.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.700
Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.400
Hostage negotiation team here in five
minutes and the mayor's been notified.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.700
- You gonna tell him?
- Get the fuck out of here.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.100
My shift's over in 10 minutes.

20:08.300 --> 20:10.000
- What are you staring at?
- Your face.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.300
I'm trying to remember
for when it's not here.

20:12.500 --> 20:15.400
- You gonna start in on me?
- Right, I'm gonna start in on you.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.700
- Don't fuck this up, Garber.
- You wanna do it?

20:17.800 --> 20:19.400
It's your station, your call.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.900
- Oh, it's my call now?
- That's right. Your call.

20:22.400 --> 20:23.500
Come on.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.600
<i>Pelham 123, come in, this is</i>
<i>Rail Control Center. Are you there?</i>

20:33.000 --> 20:35.600
Gerber Baby boy. What's up?

20:36.400 --> 20:40.200
Garber. Just wanted to let you know
the mayor's been notified.

20:40.600 --> 20:41.800
Are they gonna pay?

20:42.700 --> 20:45.800
I don't know. I'm just the,
what'd you call me? The broker.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.900
No, no, you represent
the city of New York right now, buddy.

20:49.000 --> 20:52.600
I can tell you you're dealing with one
of the all-time bureaucracies, I know.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.800
- I mean, it takes time.
- You'd better fix the bureaucracy...

20:56.000 --> 20:58.800
...because when the time comes,
these hostages...

20:58.900 --> 21:01.400
...are gonna go real quick.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.700
You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?

21:05.900 --> 21:07.800
Yeah,
no fucking pizza for them, either.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.800
No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

21:14.200 --> 21:17.500
Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.

21:17.700 --> 21:18.700
So...

21:18.900 --> 21:21.600
So, what, this is just about money?

21:21.700 --> 21:23.400
Oh, is there anything else?

21:23.500 --> 21:24.800
There's not dying.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.400
Yeah, well, you live, you die. You
go with the current or you fight it...

21:28.500 --> 21:30.200
<i>... you all end up</i>
<i>in the same place.</i>

21:30.400 --> 21:33.300
- Where's that, Jersey?
- Yeah, you watch it. I was born there.

21:33.900 --> 21:36.200
I'm just saying,
you're up in the motorman's cab.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.800
That means you're on the radio, which
means that you're an easy target.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
<i>You gotta know the drill.</i>

21:43.200 --> 21:44.900
I know that soon I won't be alone...

21:45.100 --> 21:48.700
...and if I'm the first to get shot,
I'm the first of many to get shot.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.000
That's correct,
but then you'd still be dead.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.100
Dead is an improvement on a lot
of things I can think of, buddy boy.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.700
Sounds like he slept with my ex.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.600
You know, we all owe God a death.

22:00.800 --> 22:04.600
And I'm a man who pays his debts.
Are you a man who pays his debts?

22:04.700 --> 22:07.800
Yeah, yeah, sure.
TV, cable, and my mortgage.

22:08.000 --> 22:12.400
- That's a little like dying once a month.
- You're married, you're a married man.

22:12.700 --> 22:13.800
Maybe.

22:13.900 --> 22:18.300
No, no, no. You're married, man.
Married men have mortgages.

22:19.100 --> 22:20.600
You got a mortgage?

22:20.800 --> 22:23.600
I don't know. Why don't you tell me,
then we'll both know?

22:23.700 --> 22:28.700
I don't know. I'm sure someone
out there loves you dearly and...

22:28.900 --> 22:30.700
<i>... you know,</i>
<i>would be worried about you.</i>

22:30.900 --> 22:32.700
<i>You're in the motorman's cab...</i>

22:32.900 --> 22:35.100
<i>... you got no cover,</i>
<i>sniper on the way.</i>

22:35.300 --> 22:37.800
Well, you know,
circumstances are my protection...

22:37.900 --> 22:41.100
...because right now, you know,
hostages are good insurance.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.800
By the way I see it,
I'm pretty well-protected.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.500
You know, this reminds me
of being in a confessional.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.500
Are you Catholic?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.400
I'm married, you're Catholic.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.600
- Maybe. I don't know.
- <i>No, you're Catholic.</i>

22:55.800 --> 22:57.000
And a good Catholic...

22:57.200 --> 22:59.700
...would know he's got
a trainload of innocent people.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.000
You don't wanna
kill innocent people, do you?

23:02.200 --> 23:04.600
A good Catholic
knows that nobody is innocent.

23:04.700 --> 23:08.500
And I'm not gonna kill all these
hostages. I'd give up my leverage.

23:12.200 --> 23:14.900
Well,
I hope you know what you're doing.

23:15.100 --> 23:19.200
It's running like a fucking Swiss watch
down here, so don't worry about it.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.600
So, what do I call you anyway?

23:23.900 --> 23:24.900
Call me Ryder.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.000
As in "train rider"?

23:27.200 --> 23:29.300
Call me Ryder, with a Y.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.600
<i>Ryder.</i>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.000
<i>I like you, Garber.</i>

23:34.800 --> 23:36.800
I do like you, man.

23:36.900 --> 23:38.900
You may be
the last friend I ever make.

23:40.500 --> 23:44.200
Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr. Ryder.
But, you know, I'm just a guy.

23:44.400 --> 23:46.500
<i>I'm just a guy</i>
<i>on the other end of the mic.</i>

23:47.900 --> 23:49.800
Oh, you don't think
this was meant to be?

23:49.900 --> 23:53.200
You don't think this was fate,
you and me?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.600
I don't know. Things happen
that lead to other things.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.100
And maybe this was one of them,
but that's it.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.900
I never get excited
about coincidence.

24:03.100 --> 24:05.800
Well, you got 50 fucking minutes,
so check me.

24:06.900 --> 24:08.400
All right. 50 minutes, check.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.700
And don't call me
unless you got news.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.600
- You got it.
- Motherfucker.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.500
G.B.

24:15.900 --> 24:17.100
You're fucking good, man.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.100
Okay. Move it the other way.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.400
All right, come on, move it.
The other way.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.500
Okay, now move it back a little less.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.200
Bingo. Got it.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.800
All right, we got it.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.500
- Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.

25:21.700 --> 25:23.500
Yeah, under my supervision.
Who are you?

25:23.700 --> 25:25.900
Vincent Camonetti,
NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.600
John Johnson,
Chief Transportation Officer.

25:29.000 --> 25:32.100
Walter Garber.
I'm Console Dispatch, right now.

25:32.300 --> 25:33.700
What can you tell me, Walter?

25:34.200 --> 25:36.000
His name is Ryder, with a Y.

25:36.200 --> 25:39.800
And he's asking
for $ 10 million by 3:13.

25:40.000 --> 25:44.100
Looking toward the future. Say what
he'd do if he doesn't get the money?

25:44.300 --> 25:46.800
He said he'd kill a passenger
every minute we go over.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.400
- Starting at 3:13 p.m.?
- 3-1-3, yes, sir.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.300
- Anything else?
- He's smart.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.200
If he's smart, why is he doing
something so fucking stupid?

25:54.400 --> 25:56.600
- On the train radio?
- We can get him right here.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.000
Any chance that we can get
a signal down there?

25:59.100 --> 26:01.000
We'd like to get him
on one of our cells.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.100
No,
there's no chance, not where he is.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.400
What's this?
"Leverage, spot trade"?

26:06.600 --> 26:09.500
Yeah, it's weird. He's like
a money guy, like a Wall Street.

26:09.700 --> 26:13.400
He talked about the passengers
like they were commodities.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.600
- "Catholic"?
- Yeah, I think he's Catholic.

26:15.800 --> 26:19.400
For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna tell
us what his zodiac sign is now?

26:19.500 --> 26:21.400
I'm just saying I think he's Catholic.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.900
Man asked me about "Catholic."
I wrote it down. I'm giving my opinion.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.800
Unlike other people,
I have an opinion.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.200
Fellas, can we settle
this dispute later?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
- Absolutely.
- Why do you think he's Catholic?

26:31.600 --> 26:35.100
I think he's Catholic because he talked
about original sin and confessions.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.500
I wrote it down.
I didn't know what else to do.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.300
- Did he ask for a priest?
- No.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.200
Good. Anything else?

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
He sounded, the way he was talking,
he sounded like he's not afraid to die.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.400
Yeah, well, it's early yet.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.800
- The calls are coming through...?
- Right here.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
You hit the blue button,
you can reach him.

26:55.100 --> 26:57.500
- He'll come back to you.
- Mind if I take your seat?

26:57.600 --> 27:00.000
- No, no, go right ahead.
- Thank you, Walter.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.200
You're welcome.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.200
This is the six wire.
You don't have to touch that one.

27:04.300 --> 27:05.900
- Okay.
- That goes around the room.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.300
- Six wire.
- Why don't you...

27:07.400 --> 27:09.500
Just hit the talk here
and then that mutes it.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.800
Take the rest of the day off.
Get out of here.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.500
I thought I'd stick around,
just make sure that...

27:14.700 --> 27:19.100
Well, that wasn't a suggestion.
So why don't you go home?

27:22.200 --> 27:23.600
All right.

27:24.900 --> 27:27.900
This is it. You got all the information
over here about the 313.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.900
- Wait for his call.
- You want me to work it up right now?

27:31.100 --> 27:34.600
You call headquarters, let them know
that I'm here and I'm on the job. Okay.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.900
I gotta take a piss.

27:50.100 --> 27:51.300
So who's stopping you?

27:51.500 --> 27:56.300
All right. We wouldn't wanna end up
on any Amnesty International lists...

27:56.400 --> 27:59.000
...so step up to the door, face out.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.100
Open the middle door.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.600
Do what you gotta do.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.700
Can I jump down there?

28:20.200 --> 28:22.500
- You gotta go or don't you?
- I do, I gotta go.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.900
Step up, my man. Let's go, let's go.

28:36.700 --> 28:39.500
That kid's going places.
All right, close the doors.

28:39.700 --> 28:41.100
<i>Pelham 123, come in.</i>

28:41.200 --> 28:44.900
- <i>Pelham 123, please come in.</i>
- All right, everybody, sit down!

28:56.200 --> 28:57.200
Who is this?

28:57.400 --> 29:01.400
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with
the NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.200
I'd like to talk to you
about the situation that we're in.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.800
Where the fuck is Garber?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.600
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.800
- This is now a police matter.
- Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.000
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder,
but Mr. Garber is no longer involved.

29:16.300 --> 29:17.800
Motorman, up!

29:19.300 --> 29:21.000
- Put Garber on.
- To be honest...

29:21.200 --> 29:22.800
...Mr. Garber has gone home.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.400
Put Garber on the fucking line
or I kill the motorman.

29:27.300 --> 29:31.400
I guarantee you I am the best person
for you to be talking to right now.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.300
Give me a moment
and I'll explain why.

29:33.900 --> 29:36.500
You were always
gonna be the first one to go.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.000
Oh, Jesus!

29:38.900 --> 29:40.600
Jesus.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.200
Mr. Camonetti...

29:45.400 --> 29:48.200
...you got 60 fucking seconds
before I kill another.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.000
- Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57...
- Get him. Just get Garber.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.800
- Fifty-six, 55, 54...
- We're trying to locate Garber...

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
...ASAP, Mr. Ryder.
Why did you do that?

29:57.200 --> 30:00.700
Mr. Camonetti or whatever
fucking greaseball name you got...

30:00.900 --> 30:03.300
...the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

30:03.500 --> 30:06.700
<i>Fifty-three, 52, 51...</i>

30:10.400 --> 30:11.700
Garber. Garber!

30:11.800 --> 30:15.300
Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.

30:15.500 --> 30:18.100
Come on,
he wants to talk to you right now.

30:19.500 --> 30:20.900
He's here. He's on the way.

30:22.200 --> 30:26.500
Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven...

30:26.700 --> 30:32.400
- He's approaching the desk.
- Six, five, four, three, two, one...

30:32.600 --> 30:34.100
Hey, it's me, it's Garber.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.800
Garber! You didn't say goodbye.

30:38.700 --> 30:39.700
You killed Jerry?

30:39.900 --> 30:43.000
No, the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

30:43.200 --> 30:47.200
<i>The biggest rathole</i>
<i>in the world fucking killed Jerry.</i>

30:47.400 --> 30:50.300
Okay? Now you can
chalk another victim up to NYC.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.600
- Now, can everybody hear me?
- Yeah, we hear you, loud and clear.

30:53.700 --> 30:55.500
Now you don't have to tell
the cops...

30:55.700 --> 30:59.700
...they don't tell me how to do it or how
it's gonna be. I fucking tell them.

30:59.900 --> 31:01.700
Don't you ever, ever
leave me again.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.500
Or I'll just have to hunt you down
and I'll kill you.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.300
Now, you got 39...

31:07.900 --> 31:10.400
Thirty-nine minutes. Check me.

31:11.300 --> 31:12.400
Thirty-nine, check.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.800
This is Staley to ESU 2.
What's your position?

31:24.900 --> 31:27.400
ESU 2 approaching hostage car
from south tunnel.

31:27.900 --> 31:29.100
Go, go, go.

31:31.200 --> 31:34.300
Ten-million dollars. I'll write him
a check and get it over with.

31:34.400 --> 31:37.800
- He wants it in cash.
- I was joking, LaSalle.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.100
But we've been given one hour
to get the money together.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.700
Ten-million dollars.
Where do they get these numbers?

31:43.900 --> 31:46.000
Actually, 10 is the limit, sir.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.200
Why is that?

31:47.400 --> 31:50.700
Request to the City Controller,
he forwards it to one of our lenders...

31:50.800 --> 31:54.900
...cash gets released to the Federal
Reserve. Limit at any time is 10 million.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.700
Some idiot with a gun
wouldn't know that. I didn't know.

31:57.900 --> 32:00.700
- Well, you're very busy, sir.
- How do you know that?

32:02.200 --> 32:03.800
Here he is.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.900
- Henry, what's the situation?
- They killed a hostage.

32:07.100 --> 32:09.100
These guys may be the real deal.

32:09.300 --> 32:11.300
I thought there was one idiot
with a gun.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.200
Multiple gunmen. They're not sure.
They've got 18 hostages.

32:14.300 --> 32:17.600
They'll kill more in an hour. That's
the limit. They want you to know.

32:17.800 --> 32:19.300
- What do we know?
- Not amateurs.

32:19.500 --> 32:21.200
They cut out a car,
stopped on a rise.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.400
They can see us coming
100 yards either way.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.000
How long to get the money?

32:25.200 --> 32:26.400
- I don't know.
- Find out.

32:26.500 --> 32:30.100
- You're not thinking of paying, are you?
- I'm thinking of time and being ready.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.300
Call the Controller.
Tell them we'll pay.

32:34.700 --> 32:37.100
What's with you and Garber, huh?
Tell me about him.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.400
Scheduled to work today?

32:38.500 --> 32:40.700
- Yeah, absolutely. But...
- But what?

32:40.900 --> 32:43.700
He's only had this particular job
for a couple weeks now.

32:43.900 --> 32:46.500
- Well, why is that?
- Well, he's under investigation.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.000
What?

32:48.100 --> 32:51.100
- We were gonna suspend him...
- What's he being investigated for?

32:54.400 --> 32:57.200
He went to Japan. He had to take
a look at some new trains...

32:57.300 --> 32:59.400
...and the allegation
is that he took a bribe.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.300
Took a bribe?
Does he have a record?

33:01.400 --> 33:02.800
- Not that I know.
- You sure?

33:03.000 --> 33:05.400
Yeah, yeah. I don't think so.
I gotta take this.

33:05.600 --> 33:08.800
<i>The identity of the hijackers</i>
<i>is still unclear.</i>

33:09.000 --> 33:13.100
<i>The Hostage Negotiation Team has</i>
<i>just arrived at MTA headquarters...</i>

33:13.300 --> 33:16.200
<i>... to determine</i>
<i>if this is a terrorist enterprise.</i>

33:16.900 --> 33:19.700
Is that what we are? An enterprise?

33:21.500 --> 33:22.700
We're an enterprise.

33:26.800 --> 33:31.200
Well, pilot reports
that the aircraft has begun its descent.

33:37.400 --> 33:40.300
This is Staley to ESU 4.
What's your ETA?

33:40.400 --> 33:43.200
Approximately two minutes
south of target.

33:43.800 --> 33:46.000
Why is the train called
Pelham 123?

33:46.600 --> 33:49.100
Comes out of Pelham Bay
at 1:23 in the afternoon.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.100
How did you end up with this call?

33:52.300 --> 33:54.200
It's a Lexington Avenue train.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.900
I got the Lexington Avenue desk.
Came through my desk.

33:57.100 --> 33:59.200
Can you think of a reason
why you'd be targeted?

33:59.400 --> 34:02.400
Someone wanna hurt you?
Something against you or something?

34:02.600 --> 34:03.900
No.

34:10.400 --> 34:12.000
You recognize his voice?

34:13.600 --> 34:17.600
No. No, as I said, it was a coincidence
it came through my desk.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.300
Did you pick this desk?
Or was it assigned to you?

34:23.900 --> 34:25.300
Did I...?

34:25.500 --> 34:28.400
I said, did you pick this desk
or was it assigned to you?

34:34.800 --> 34:36.199
Can I take my coat off?

34:39.800 --> 34:41.000
Doesn't make any sense.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.900
- What doesn't?
- Guy you're talking to.

34:43.000 --> 34:46.400
He ain't a train dispatcher.
Walter Garber.

34:46.500 --> 34:48.500
- He's a big shot.
- Big shot at what?

34:48.699 --> 34:50.900
Rail Control.
I mean, he runs things up there.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.699
- At least he did before I went up.
- His name is Walter?

34:53.900 --> 34:55.199
Yeah.

34:56.500 --> 34:59.500
Dude like that
shouldn't be answering the phone.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.800
- Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
- Right.

35:08.000 --> 35:10.900
Are you sure you don't have
some sort of relationship with him?

35:11.100 --> 35:15.500
I assure you, whatever relationship
I have with him is better than yours.

35:15.700 --> 35:18.600
Jerry, my friend, was killed
while you were talking to Ryder.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.300
Maybe that's a question
you ask yourself instead of me.

35:21.400 --> 35:23.400
I didn't have anything to do
with this.

35:23.500 --> 35:26.200
But what I have in you,
Mr. Garber, is an unknown variable.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.900
- Unknown variable?
- Right. People's lives are at stake.

35:29.100 --> 35:30.600
- I understand that.
- Excuse me...

35:30.700 --> 35:33.100
...if I try to get more comfortable
with you, okay?

35:33.900 --> 35:36.000
It ain't working, but okay.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.100
Now, with that in mind...

35:38.300 --> 35:41.800
...would you agree
to a consensual search of your house?

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
Take me 40, 45 minutes
to get a warrant.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.500
What...

35:49.700 --> 35:50.900
Yes, okay.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.000
Got him.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.200
Walter Garber, right there.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.800
No shit, look at this.

36:05.500 --> 36:08.500
- Guy took a bribe, man.
- Yeah.

36:09.700 --> 36:10.700
Baby!

36:21.300 --> 36:23.900
ESU 2, this is Staley.
What's your overall status?

36:24.100 --> 36:25.600
All positions secured.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.300
<i>All right,</i>
<i>hold your fire until instructed.</i>

36:34.900 --> 36:37.000
Pelham 123, can you hear me?

36:37.500 --> 36:39.300
Yeah, loud and clear, back at you.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.900
All right,
the mayor has agreed to pay...

36:42.100 --> 36:44.600
...and they're getting the money
together right now.

36:44.700 --> 36:45.700
<i>Good.</i>

36:45.900 --> 36:49.600
Well, you know, you got 28 minutes,
so I advise him to make haste.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.800
- I'm sure he will.
- So is your first name Walter?

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
- Excuse me?
- Your name, is it Walter?

36:58.500 --> 36:59.800
- Yes, it is.
- <i>Good.</i>

37:00.000 --> 37:01.800
What are you doing
dispatching trains?

37:01.900 --> 37:04.700
I thought you were some sort of
MTA big shot.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.800
I work for the MTA.
Today they put me at dispatch...

37:10.100 --> 37:11.200
...and my bad luck.

37:11.300 --> 37:13.300
I thought you didn't
believe in bad luck.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.900
I said I didn't believe in fate.

37:16.100 --> 37:18.800
Do you believe in
rigged contracts for new trains?

37:20.300 --> 37:23.200
Look, what are
we talking about this for?

37:23.400 --> 37:26.300
- I need to know who I'm dealing with.
- You need to know who...?

37:26.500 --> 37:30.600
Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing
with. I mean, are you a bad penny?

37:30.800 --> 37:32.300
Let me explain something to you.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.200
Being accused of something
is one thing.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.000
Being guilty of it
is something entirely different.

37:38.200 --> 37:41.600
Well, agreed. But you gotta
take me through this, my man.

37:41.700 --> 37:45.500
You got to tell me from the top.
This whole train thing. Come on.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
All right,
I started out in maintenance.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.200
Platform maintenance,
track maintenance, flagman...

37:55.900 --> 37:57.700
- <i>... conductor.</i>
- Conductor, really?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.500
Yeah. And then motorman.

38:00.700 --> 38:02.700
A motorman.
How long did you do that for?

38:03.300 --> 38:04.700
I drove them over six years.

38:04.900 --> 38:07.900
I went to tower operations,
assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.

38:08.100 --> 38:09.100
<i>I finally ended up</i>...

38:09.300 --> 38:12.900
Yeah, you're assistant chief
transportation officer or something.

38:13.100 --> 38:16.500
- Right?
- That's right.

38:17.100 --> 38:21.100
And part of my job is to go out
to the manufacturers, you know...

38:21.200 --> 38:25.800
<i>... the people who build the trains</i>
<i>and bid on contracts for the trains.</i>

38:26.000 --> 38:27.500
Is that where you took the bribe?

38:27.700 --> 38:30.500
The Japanese train
over the Canadian train?

38:30.600 --> 38:34.800
I did not take a bribe, all right?
I was accused of taking a bribe.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.500
I have not been proven guilty yet.

38:37.600 --> 38:40.000
They haven't said yet.
I mean, they haven't decided.

38:40.200 --> 38:44.600
Well, they got no proof. I don't care
what they decide. It doesn't matter...

38:44.800 --> 38:46.400
Then is this
when they demoted you?

38:46.600 --> 38:49.600
That's correct. They demoted me,
pending the outcome.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.500
And now they're trying
to humiliate you, is that right?

38:52.700 --> 38:54.400
Motherfuckers.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.600
<i>Look, I know</i>
<i>how these things work, man, okay?</i>

38:56.800 --> 38:59.100
<i>Everything doesn't seem</i>
<i>to appear like what it is.</i>

38:59.300 --> 39:01.600
But you've gotta be
completely honest with me, man.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.500
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- How did you do it?

39:04.600 --> 39:06.800
I didn't. I'm innocent.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
Oh, you're innocent.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.000
No, you're talking to a Catholic,
man.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.900
We've been over innocent before.
Okay?

39:13.100 --> 39:17.300
Look, I've been through all this, man.
So just tell me, how did you do it?

39:19.700 --> 39:22.100
I didn't do it.

39:22.200 --> 39:24.300
Okay, that's it! That's fucking it!

39:24.500 --> 39:25.100
Damn it.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.100
- Kid. You.
- Me?

39:29.300 --> 39:32.100
No, no, you. Up.
Get the fuck over there.

39:32.600 --> 39:34.600
I don't know what you did
to piss him off.

39:34.800 --> 39:37.400
Garber.
You know what I'm looking at?

39:37.800 --> 39:40.300
- <i>Do you know what I'm looking at?</i>
- No, I do not.

39:40.500 --> 39:43.800
First there's my gun, and at the end
of my gun... What's your name?

39:43.900 --> 39:47.000
- George. Everyone calls me Geo.
- George. His friends call him Geo.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.900
<i>Got this '80s skateboard thing</i>
<i>going.</i>

39:49.100 --> 39:52.500
He makes it work, but it's not gonna
look too good in his casket.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.900
Listen, Ryder, just slow down.
We haven't reached the deadline.

39:56.100 --> 39:58.100
No, there's no fucking deadline,
man.

39:58.300 --> 39:59.800
You just gotta tell me the truth.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.800
- About what?
- <i>The bribe!</i>

40:02.000 --> 40:04.200
- Did you take it?
- I didn't take a bribe.

40:04.400 --> 40:06.900
Okay, you got five seconds
to save this kid's life.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.900
I didn't do anything.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.800
- Five...
- Just wait a second.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.300
- Four, three...
- Wait a second!

40:13.400 --> 40:15.000
Two...

40:15.200 --> 40:17.900
- Fucking tell him how you did it.
- All right, okay.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.100
- <i>Say it.</i>
- I took the bribe.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.500
How much?

40:29.200 --> 40:30.500
Thirty...

40:30.700 --> 40:32.200
How fucking much?

40:33.300 --> 40:35.400
Thirty-five thousand dollars.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.900
How did you do it?

40:37.600 --> 40:40.500
I went to Japan
to look at these trains.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.400
It's part of my job.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.000
I...

40:44.200 --> 40:48.100
I don't get to vote, okay?
I just recommend.

40:48.300 --> 40:52.500
I chose what I thought
was the best train...

40:52.600 --> 40:55.600
...the Japanese had the best train,
and I made my recommendation.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.500
That's before you took the bribe.

40:58.100 --> 40:59.700
Yes.

40:59.900 --> 41:02.200
That was the train
you were gonna pick anyway, huh?

41:02.400 --> 41:05.300
- Yes.
- And now you're fighting for your job...

41:05.500 --> 41:07.400
...and they're trying
to humiliate you?

41:07.500 --> 41:11.800
No, no, no. I did what I did.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.800
And...

41:14.200 --> 41:16.800
And it's not, you know,
it's not the MTA's fault.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.500
What did you spend it on?

41:19.600 --> 41:21.800
Look, what does this
got to do with anything, huh?

41:22.000 --> 41:23.600
What did you fucking spend it on?

41:23.700 --> 41:26.900
I used the money for my kids,
all right?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.700
To pay my children's tuition.

41:28.900 --> 41:33.000
I have a 17-year-old.
I have a 19-year-old daughter.

41:33.600 --> 41:37.800
And I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, all right?

41:44.600 --> 41:45.900
You know what, Garber?

41:46.500 --> 41:48.200
You're my goddamn hero,
you know that?

41:48.400 --> 41:51.900
<i>You got a kid here, you don't even</i>
<i>know him, you saved his life.</i>

41:52.300 --> 41:55.900
That's brave, man.
That's fucking heroic.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.800
- Tell Garber thank you.
- Thank you, Garber.

41:59.900 --> 42:01.900
"Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life."

42:02.300 --> 42:04.100
Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life.

42:07.000 --> 42:08.700
You're welcome.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.500
Sit down.

42:14.300 --> 42:17.000
You're just like me, Garber.
I fueled this city.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.700
I fed it breakfast every morning,
and now we're the bad guys.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.800
I don't think so.
I don't fucking think so!

42:40.000 --> 42:42.400
- Hello, Therese.
- <i>Honey, look.</i>

42:42.600 --> 42:45.400
There are police here, Walt.
They wanna search the house.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.300
They said you said it was okay.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.500
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.
It's... Just let them in.

42:54.600 --> 42:55.600
We got nothing to hide.

42:56.100 --> 42:57.600
Is this about the investigation?

42:58.300 --> 43:00.500
No, no. You watching TV?

43:00.800 --> 43:03.000
This hostage thing.
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.

43:03.600 --> 43:05.600
Well, it's just that...

43:05.800 --> 43:07.700
I'll tell you about it
when I get home...

43:07.800 --> 43:11.300
...but I'm in the middle of it now and
they wanna do background checks...

43:11.500 --> 43:13.500
...on everybody involved here
from the MTA.

43:13.700 --> 43:17.200
- That's why they're at the house.
- All right, okay. But you're okay?

43:17.400 --> 43:20.500
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in.
I'll see you when I get home.

43:20.700 --> 43:23.200
All right. Okay, bye.

43:23.400 --> 43:24.500
I'm sorry, Walter.

43:25.500 --> 43:26.900
I am.

43:27.100 --> 43:30.300
Listen, don't let this guy
bring you into his reality, all right?

43:30.500 --> 43:33.200
That's what he wants to do.
He hurts you, you get angry.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.600
- He's got the advantage. Understand?
- Yeah.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.800
Just deflect, if you can.

43:38.600 --> 43:40.800
- Okay? All right.
- All right.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.200
I hope they don't get fucking lost.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.300
Fuck me! Ten-million bucks.

44:19.900 --> 44:22.200
The joke is,
say we dipped in, took some?

44:22.300 --> 44:25.300
Bad guys would count it,
come up short, probably kill us.

44:25.700 --> 44:27.000
No shit.

44:38.600 --> 44:40.300
Geo, what the fuck's happening?

44:43.000 --> 44:46.200
<i>Geo. Geo, what's going on?</i>

44:48.500 --> 44:50.100
Geo.

44:51.700 --> 44:53.900
I'm a fucking hostage.

44:56.100 --> 45:00.300
Listen to me.
Stream it on our site. Call the news.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.400
<i>Shit.</i>

45:08.400 --> 45:09.800
Hey.

45:13.900 --> 45:17.300
We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill us.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.100
You got a plan?

45:22.800 --> 45:24.100
I thought you'd have one.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.300
Because I'm some
tough-looking black guy?

45:34.400 --> 45:37.000
I saw that ring on your finger.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.300
That was a long time ago.

45:44.500 --> 45:47.100
- Okay?
- My husband had one just like it.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.300
<i>A severe sell-off underway...</i>

45:55.500 --> 45:58.800
<i>... the Dow is down 450 points</i>
<i>in very heavy trading...</i>

45:58.900 --> 46:01.300
<i>... as Wall Street reacts</i>
<i>to the terrorist attack...</i>

46:01.400 --> 46:04.400
<i>... of the New York City</i>
<i>subway system.</i>

46:11.300 --> 46:14.600
- How's my hair look?
- Fine. You ready to make a statement?

46:14.800 --> 46:16.800
When I have something to tell them.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.600
It's a leadership moment, sir.

46:18.800 --> 46:21.600
I'm not running for re-election,
for fucking president.

46:21.800 --> 46:24.000
I left my Rudy Giuliani suit at home.

46:24.200 --> 46:27.500
You're being selfish.
It'll take 30 seconds to reassure them.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.100
- Over there!
- Mr. Mayor!

46:36.200 --> 46:39.500
- Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
- Will you be making a statement?

46:39.700 --> 46:42.700
We're doing everything
the situation demands.

46:42.900 --> 46:45.800
I'm not gonna speculate right now.
All right?

46:45.900 --> 46:48.100
- Mayor, is it terrorism?
- No.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.100
Hey.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.200
Mayor! Are they terrorists?

46:52.400 --> 46:54.700
All right, all right, all right!

46:54.800 --> 46:57.000
Listen, nobody said anything
about terrorism...

46:57.100 --> 47:00.400
...or a bomb, anything like that.
Let's stop that right now, all right?

47:00.600 --> 47:03.400
How about your divorce? Care
to speculate how that's going?

47:03.500 --> 47:04.700
Your divorce, sir.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.700
Been a lot of talk in the news
lately...

47:06.900 --> 47:10.800
...that you have extramarital problems.
Your divorce, sir!

47:12.500 --> 47:14.200
Put it on channel 15.

47:14.400 --> 47:17.600
We got a girl in Brooklyn watching it
on her boyfriend's computer.

47:17.800 --> 47:19.900
- It's on the damn Internet.
- What?

47:22.300 --> 47:24.000
Hold on.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.800
- Son of a bitch.
- That's Ramos, isn't it?

47:27.000 --> 47:28.100
That's Phil Ramos.

47:28.300 --> 47:29.700
- Yes, it is.
- Who's Phil Ramos?

47:29.900 --> 47:33.600
He was a motorman. He killed a
couple of passengers 10 years ago?

47:33.800 --> 47:37.600
High on cough syrup, ran into the
platform, went to jail for manslaughter.

47:37.700 --> 47:39.400
Phil Ramos, I want everything.

47:39.600 --> 47:42.900
Prison time, known associates, the
works. Looks like it's from the floor.

47:43.100 --> 47:45.800
- Should the Internet be working there?
- No. No way.

47:45.900 --> 47:48.400
Maybe that's how he knows about you.
He Googled you.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.200
Or maybe Ramos told him,
who knows?

47:53.600 --> 47:56.500
Goddamn, it's the mayor.
Hello, Your Honor.

47:59.800 --> 48:02.000
Do me a favor,
forget about those guys.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.200
Easy for you to say.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.100
You rather be
one of those hostages?

48:05.300 --> 48:06.400
No.

48:06.500 --> 48:09.600
Listen up, I'll give you a crash course
on hostage negotiating.

48:09.800 --> 48:11.500
We're like rodeo clowns.

48:11.600 --> 48:15.200
We keep the bull from focusing on
what he'd like to do. Which is what?

48:15.300 --> 48:16.700
- Kill a cowboy.
- Exactly.

48:16.800 --> 48:19.300
Now, he's got his deadline.
You slow things down.

48:19.500 --> 48:23.300
Preservation of life. That's our mission.
Guy's already proven he's serious.

48:23.500 --> 48:25.600
Next deadline's gonna give
a chance again.

48:25.800 --> 48:28.500
- How do we deal with that?
- Get the money there on time.

48:28.700 --> 48:31.100
If we don't, we pretend
the deadline doesn't exist...

48:31.300 --> 48:33.400
...talk through it, we buy time,
get movement.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.000
- Movement?
- That's right.

48:35.100 --> 48:39.000
Contradicts himself, inconsistency in
his demand, you got some movement.

48:39.100 --> 48:42.700
- Right.
- All right, let's go out there.

48:45.300 --> 48:46.800
<i>This was the scene</i>
<i>moments ago...</i>

48:47.000 --> 48:49.300
<i>... outside the Rail Control Center</i>
<i>in Midtown.</i>

48:49.500 --> 48:51.700
<i>I'm not gonna speculate right now.</i>

48:51.900 --> 48:54.100
That is a beautiful suit
he's got there.

48:57.200 --> 49:00.200
Can't get it out of my head.
I'm gonna die today.

49:01.300 --> 49:06.200
Visualization's a very powerful thing.
You keep thinking it, you never know.

49:19.100 --> 49:21.900
Please let it be me
who drops this motherfucker.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.600
Hey, Garber. You there, buddy?

49:32.800 --> 49:34.200
Yeah, I'm here.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.600
<i>A little birdie told me</i>
<i>the mayor walked in.</i>

49:36.800 --> 49:38.100
Can I talk to him?

49:40.900 --> 49:43.300
- <i>Can he hear me?</i>
- How does he know I'm here?

49:44.800 --> 49:47.100
- Does he have a camera in here?
- Can he hear me?

49:47.300 --> 49:51.300
We can, we can, we can...
We can all hear you here. Yes.

49:51.500 --> 49:56.200
Okay, good. So tell him...
Tell him I wanna make him a deal.

49:57.000 --> 49:59.200
<i>Tell him I'll make him a deal</i>
<i>right now.</i>

49:59.400 --> 50:01.000
Okay, all right.

50:01.200 --> 50:02.800
Well, come on, speak up,
Mr. Mayor.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.700
You're talking to your constituents.

50:04.900 --> 50:08.400
We got a train full
of registered voters. Don't you care?

50:08.600 --> 50:11.200
Don't you care about your voters?

50:12.800 --> 50:15.900
This is not a good idea.
Don't talk. Don't engage with him.

50:16.100 --> 50:18.700
I know what I'm doing,
I've been doing this a long time.

50:18.900 --> 50:20.100
<i>Come on, buddy, speak up.</i>

50:20.300 --> 50:23.000
You gotta hit the blue button there,
Your Honor.

50:24.600 --> 50:26.000
Yes, this is the mayor.

50:26.400 --> 50:28.600
Hey. Good to meet you, man.

50:28.800 --> 50:31.200
And listen, tell me this, is this true?

50:31.400 --> 50:32.700
I read that you make, like...

50:32.900 --> 50:36.500
<i>... one dollar a year to be a mayor</i>
<i>of New York, is that true?</i>

50:36.700 --> 50:39.000
Yes, but at least it's honest work.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.700
After taxes that's, like,
87 cents, isn't it?

50:42.900 --> 50:43.900
Yes.

50:44.100 --> 50:45.500
Don't bullshit me, man.

50:45.700 --> 50:49.800
It would take, like, 3000 years
to pay off that suit that you're wearing.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.900
What do you got, 20, 30 million
dollars or something like that?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.900
You don't get that without screwing
someone, screwing everyone.

50:56.100 --> 50:58.200
I'm sure your wife knows
something about that.

51:03.100 --> 51:04.600
You said you had a deal for me.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.600
Yeah, I do.
I wanna make you a deal.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.900
I wanna tell you
you could come down here...

51:09.100 --> 51:13.100
...and I will trade you for all these
passengers in the train, how's that?

51:17.000 --> 51:21.000
Okay, you could save the lives
of 17 New Yorkers.

51:21.200 --> 51:23.100
Now, that's a good deal.

51:25.700 --> 51:27.000
<i>What do you think?</i>

51:31.500 --> 51:33.000
Give us a moment.

51:33.100 --> 51:34.900
Okay.

51:35.300 --> 51:37.300
I'll give you a moment.

51:39.600 --> 51:42.200
You turn this into a circus,
gonna get someone killed.

51:42.400 --> 51:45.000
Now, you entered his world, exit it.

51:50.400 --> 51:53.900
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?

51:54.200 --> 51:57.000
It's a nice offer, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to decline.

51:57.100 --> 52:00.200
Good. Because if you begged me,
I wouldn't give you that deal, man.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.200
You think anyone cares about
a philandering asshole like you?

52:03.300 --> 52:06.300
New York would love me to
pull the fucking trigger on you.

52:06.500 --> 52:10.100
Hey, Garber. This is the... This is
the guy that's trying to get rid of you.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.200
- Keep talking.
- Do you believe this shit?

52:12.300 --> 52:14.000
- Calm...
- <i>You don't think he...</i>

52:14.200 --> 52:15.700
...broke the same rules
we broke?

52:15.800 --> 52:17.700
- He knows it, I know it.
- Calm him down.

52:17.900 --> 52:19.400
- All right...
- <i>He can eat shit.</i>

52:19.600 --> 52:21.000
- Calm him down.
- You're...

52:21.200 --> 52:23.000
- <i>You're breaking up.</i>
- He can kiss my ass!

52:23.200 --> 52:25.200
I like the deal.
It's a good deal, but...

52:25.400 --> 52:26.700
<i>Fuck you, Mr. Mayor!</i>

52:26.900 --> 52:30.500
Now, I want my fucking money now!
You understand me? Now!

52:30.700 --> 52:33.600
- Just tell him the money's on the way.
- The money's on the way.

52:33.800 --> 52:36.300
Because he's, like,
a used-car salesman, this asshole.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.900
He can lick my bunghole,
motherfucker!

52:39.700 --> 52:42.200
One mistake
and everyone has something to say.

52:42.900 --> 52:44.200
Was she worth it?

52:44.400 --> 52:48.100
Yes. You have nine minutes.
How are you gonna get the money?

52:48.300 --> 52:51.500
They're shutting down every
intersection here to Brooklyn.

52:59.700 --> 53:01.600
Phil Ramos, male, Hispanic, 39.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.900
Sentenced two to four years
for manslaughter...

53:04.100 --> 53:06.100
...paroled last month from Clinton.

53:06.200 --> 53:09.400
His PO, Justafarro, says he's
living in a halfway house in Queens.

53:09.600 --> 53:13.000
He's not an absconder, he made his
appearances, his piss has been clean.

53:13.100 --> 53:16.100
But he was a no-show at work today.
He didn't call in, nothing.

53:16.300 --> 53:18.100
He knows the system.

53:18.300 --> 53:20.600
The perfect place in the subway
to stop the train.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.500
He's been out a month.
This wasn't planned in three weeks.

53:23.700 --> 53:26.700
Find out Ramos's cellmates,
who worked in the laundry with him.

53:26.900 --> 53:29.200
Call lists, visitors lists ASAP.

53:41.200 --> 53:42.400
<i>105 North Avenue.</i>

53:53.000 --> 53:54.100
- Shit! Look out!
- Shit!

54:05.000 --> 54:06.900
<i>The market has tumbled</i>
<i>nearly 7 percent...</i>

54:07.000 --> 54:09.100
<i>... as investors continue</i>
<i>to react to events...</i>

54:09.300 --> 54:10.700
They just came off the bridge.

54:10.800 --> 54:13.900
Why didn't we send
a helicopter for the money?

54:15.800 --> 54:18.600
Now remember what I said
about talking through deadlines.

54:18.800 --> 54:22.400
We better have a plan B in case
the money isn't there on the dot.

54:22.600 --> 54:24.400
Put him on his heels.
He knows things.

54:24.600 --> 54:26.400
- We know things too, right?
- Right.

54:26.600 --> 54:29.600
Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right?
Just get him talking.

54:29.800 --> 54:30.800
You can do it.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
- Hey, Ryder.
- The money here yet?

54:37.100 --> 54:38.100
<i>On the way.</i>

54:38.300 --> 54:40.500
Then what the fuck
are you calling me for?

54:40.700 --> 54:42.600
Actually, I just called to talk.

54:43.700 --> 54:45.900
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>What do you wanna talk about?</i>

54:46.600 --> 54:49.900
You said that
being in the motorman's cab...

54:50.100 --> 54:52.500
...was a little like
being in a confessional, right?

54:52.600 --> 54:53.700
Yeah?

54:53.800 --> 54:56.700
I was thinking maybe it's like
being in a prison cell too.

54:56.800 --> 55:00.300
What are you trying to say? That
if I get caught, I'd better get used to it?

55:00.500 --> 55:03.200
No, I'm just wondering.
Maybe you're already used to it.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.900
I'm wondering maybe that's how
you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?

55:08.100 --> 55:09.700
How the fuck he know that?

55:09.900 --> 55:11.900
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.400
After today's confession...

55:13.600 --> 55:15.600
<i>... you're gonna find your ass</i>
<i>in prison too.</i>

55:15.800 --> 55:18.400
Which is my point. I want you
to hook me up on the inside.

55:18.600 --> 55:21.700
You know everybody. This way,
when I come up with my heist plan...

55:21.900 --> 55:23.900
...you know, I'll cut you in.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.700
I can see I've inspired you.
Okay, I got a story for you.

55:26.800 --> 55:29.800
<i>It might help you in prison.</i>
<i>You wanna hear it? We got a minute.</i>

55:30.000 --> 55:31.400
I'd like to hear a little story.

55:31.600 --> 55:34.200
<i>So back in the day,</i>
<i>when I was a high roller...</i>

55:34.400 --> 55:35.900
When were you ever a high roller?

55:37.600 --> 55:39.500
<i>I told you I fed this city breakfast.</i>

55:39.700 --> 55:40.700
Grits and eggs?

55:40.900 --> 55:43.000
Something like that.
Anyway, back in the day...

55:43.200 --> 55:45.600
...I took this chick to Iceland.

55:45.900 --> 55:48.400
Iceland? Is that where
all the high rollers go?

55:48.600 --> 55:51.600
Six hours from Kennedy
and the nightclub scene is...

55:51.800 --> 55:53.000
...you know, is intense.

55:53.200 --> 55:55.100
<i>I thought I'd take this chick</i>
<i>to Iceland.</i>

55:55.200 --> 55:56.600
- What's her name?
- <i>Ludvika.</i>

55:56.800 --> 55:59.800
She was Lithuanian.
She was an ass model.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.600
She asked you what?

56:02.100 --> 56:03.500
You heard of hand models?

56:03.700 --> 56:06.100
<i>Advertisement?</i>
<i>Right, she was an ass model.</i>

56:06.300 --> 56:09.600
She did jeans and, you know,
magazines and shit.

56:09.800 --> 56:12.000
Anyway,
it was Fashion Week in New York...

56:12.200 --> 56:14.100
...and I took her to Iceland.

56:14.300 --> 56:18.500
Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model,
Iceland, you took her to the ice.

56:18.700 --> 56:20.100
- So what?
- <i>Well, for 500 bucks...</i>

56:20.300 --> 56:22.800
<i>... they'll take you on a dogsled ride</i>
<i>on a glacier.</i>

56:23.000 --> 56:25.500
- Dogsled?
- <i>Yeah. And you know the old saying:</i>

56:25.800 --> 56:27.200
<i>If you're not the lead dog...</i>

56:27.400 --> 56:29.000
- <i>... the view never changes?</i>
- Right.

56:29.200 --> 56:32.800
Otherwise, you're always looking at
the asshole of the dog in front of you.

56:33.200 --> 56:35.500
<i>Be funny in a minute</i>
<i>when I get to that part.</i>

56:35.600 --> 56:36.700
It's funny now.

56:37.305 --> 56:43.405
