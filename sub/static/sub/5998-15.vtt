00:15.149 --> 00:17.583

- I'm not a politician.

"This isn't me,"

00:19.320 --> 00:21.053

what do the people have?

00:23.390 --> 00:26.258

- Oh, my God.

00:28.728 --> 00:31.230

let's get this party started.

00:31.232 --> 00:35.200
I'm about to introduce you
to a real, live hero.

00:35.202 --> 00:38.737
Local boy, born and bred
in our Ward.

00:38.739 --> 00:42.241
He puts his life on the line
every day for regular people,

00:42.243 --> 00:45.411
and he's about to do even more
for the city of Chicago.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.413
Put your hands together

00:47.415 --> 00:50.182

My name's Matt Casey.

I have no idea how Tamara roped
me into this, but, um...

01:12.705 --> 01:15.174
I recently saw first-hand

01:15.176 --> 01:18.143

advantage of people.

Mr. Booker.

- Denny, please.

01:48.175 --> 01:49.308
Um, listen.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.876
You want to win this thing,

01:50.878 --> 01:54.179
you have to get the
community leaders behind you.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.547
What are you gonna
do about that?

01:55.549 --> 01:56.682
- Who's this guy?

01:56.684 --> 01:58.517
- Sweetheart, I just
put up a few fliers.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.686
Who shows up
is anybody's guess,

02:00.688 --> 02:02.554

02:02.556 --> 02:04.790
I got no idea what he's about.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.595
- So it's official.

02:09.597 --> 02:11.163
Casey is running for alderman.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.731
- Yay, all right!
- Whoo!

02:12.733 --> 02:13.832

02:13.834 --> 02:16.301

season hockey games,

02:16.303 --> 02:17.836

02:17.838 --> 02:19.805
Hey, what can we do to help?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.840
- Uh, first order of business:

02:21.842 --> 02:23.542
we got to get Casey's
name on the ballot.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.610
So we're a little
late to the party.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.145
We only have, like, a week

02:26.147 --> 02:29.248
to collect 450 signatures.
- Done!

02:29.250 --> 02:32.317
I'll post a copy over
at Molly's, 10% off all drinks

02:32.319 --> 02:33.819
for anybody
who signs the petition.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.656
- Pretty sure that's illegal.
- Eh, 5%, then.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.491
- Still illegal.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.162
- I probably should have
come to you sooner,

02:43.164 --> 02:44.863
but I was still weighing
my decision.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.566
- So you've decided to run?

02:47.568 --> 02:50.869
- Pending your approval,
of course.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.838
It's a big responsibility,
I know.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.840
But I'm confident I can serve

02:54.842 --> 02:58.310

from being in office,

03:07.588 --> 03:09.321

- Don't bring politics
into my firehouse.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.759

Of course not.

If you'll excuse me,

03:17.298 --> 03:19.431
I have a woman crisis
I need to take care of.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.799
- Can I help?

03:20.801 --> 03:24.403
- Not unless you're running
for Fire Commissioner next.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.605
- One thing at a time, Chief.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.574
- Hm.

03:30.343 --> 03:33.345

overheard Connie on the phone

03:33.347 --> 03:35.847
talking about a major personnel
change for Truck.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.316
- You sure she said Truck?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.584
She's probably talking
about Chili's empty slot.

03:38.586 --> 03:39.885

filling that yet?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.887
- No.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.856
No, no, no.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.826

03:47.828 --> 03:49.861
- Why not?
What's his deal?

03:49.863 --> 03:51.830
- They call him
"The Bitter End."

03:51.832 --> 03:54.766
- Anger comes off him
in waves.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.802
- I'm Rodney Ogle.
You've probably heard of me.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.637
- Uh, no, I don't think so.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.772

uh, how about this.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.906
- What?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.140
- That's crazy.
They can't do that.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.942
- Unfortunately, they can.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.345
Union allows for firefighters
with more seniority

10:13.347 --> 10:15.313
to bump candidates
out of their slot.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.681
- Guys, it's all good.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.350
I'm gonna go into
floater rotation.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.186
My brother's been trying
to get me a position

10:21.188 --> 10:22.821
at his house, so...

10:22.823 --> 10:25.357
who knows?
Yeah.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.898
- Listen, you're gonna
land on your feet, but...

10:33.900 --> 10:36.167
it's gonna hurt like hell
to see you go.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.103
- Appreciate that.

10:38.105 --> 10:40.872
It's been a real honor
being at this place.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.379
- Yeah, whatever.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.381
- Gentlemen?
- Hey, Lieutenant.

10:49.383 --> 10:50.749
- What'd you hear
about McCormick?

10:50.751 --> 10:51.883
- They were able
to save the leg,

10:51.885 --> 10:53.284
but he's still unconscious.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.220
Bunch of us are going
to head over to Med soon.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.789
- Okay, well,
he'll be in our thoughts.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.159
Richter, hey.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.927
Uh, do you got a sec?
- Sure, yeah.

11:02.929 --> 11:03.928
What's up?

11:03.930 --> 11:05.330
- Uh...

11:05.332 --> 11:07.132
doing the, uh,

11:07.134 --> 11:08.933
the paperwork from
the call this morning.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.769
Just wanted to run
something by you.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.004
Joe Cruz, one of my men--

11:13.006 --> 11:16.141
he saw the aerial was
up for a pipe drill,

11:16.143 --> 11:18.810
which means that
you and McCormick

11:18.812 --> 11:20.679
must've been close
to each other

11:20.681 --> 11:21.680
when he went down.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.081
- Your guy calling me a liar?

11:23.083 --> 11:25.083
- Whoa, hey,
take it easy, okay?

11:25.085 --> 11:27.852
I just wanted to come
down here

11:27.854 --> 11:29.120
and have a conversation--

11:29.122 --> 11:30.922
give you a chance to set
the record straight.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.291
- Well, Cruz saw wrong.

11:33.293 --> 11:37.696
I was getting on the roof
when McCormick went down.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.799
We go back, you and me.
Why would I lie about that?

11:42.268 --> 11:45.070
- We heard you guys
had some bad blood--

11:45.072 --> 11:46.971
some sort of personal thing.

11:46.973 --> 11:49.107
- Me and Mac had words
about Gretchen, yeah.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.110
But so what?
He's a brother.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.979
And I'm as messed up as anyone
over what happened to him.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.082
- There a problem here?

11:57.084 --> 11:59.718
- Not unless
you want there to be.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.487
Back up.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.962
- If I'd been close enough
to help him, I would have.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.164
But I was on the roof.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.202
- Got it.

12:17.204 --> 12:29.948
- Hey, Lieutenant, I downloaded
the petition form.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.216
- You didn't have to do that.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.118
- How many copies you want?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.954
- Where'd you make the copies?

12:35.956 --> 12:37.489
- On the Xerox in the bullpen.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.958
I waited till Connie
was out on lunch break.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.393
- Herrmann,
I can't use CFD resources

12:42.395 --> 12:43.495
for campaign business.

12:43.497 --> 12:44.796
- What?
Says who?

12:44.798 --> 12:47.232
- Uh, the Illinois
State Board of Elections.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.833
- Who's gonna know?
- Me.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.870
Here, go pay Connie
for the use of the copier.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.406
- I'm more afraid of her
than I am Board of Elections.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.476
Thank you.

13:00.146 --> 13:01.346
[raps door]
- Hey, Casey.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.380
Quick question.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.815
- Sure.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.217
You can be the first to support
my run for alderman.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.188
- If I was any kind
of friend at all,

13:10.190 --> 13:11.222
I'd talk you out of this.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.957
- What's your actual question?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.125
- When Cruz was on Truck,

13:14.127 --> 13:15.827
he was pretty good
with the ladder, right?

13:15.829 --> 13:16.861
- Cruz?

13:16.863 --> 13:17.862
- Yeah.

13:17.864 --> 13:19.230
- I once watched him
put the aerial

13:19.232 --> 13:20.832
dead bang on
a fifth story window

13:20.834 --> 13:23.101
he couldn't even see,
the smoke was so thick.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.369
Best I ever saw.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.404
Why?

13:26.406 --> 13:29.340
- Well, it's--
it's firefighter business.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.243
Doesn't concern a politician
like yourself.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.389
- Chief Burwell?

13:44.391 --> 13:46.224
- Oh.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.259
Much better over here,
don't you think?

13:51.330 --> 13:52.831
What's the matter...
Chief?

13:52.833 --> 13:53.932
You don't like
when somebody

13:53.934 --> 13:56.134
comes into your house
and interferes?

13:56.136 --> 13:58.503
Well, neither do I.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.904
- I'm not following.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.306
- One of my guys at 21

14:01.308 --> 14:03.374
took a nasty fall
this morning.

14:03.376 --> 14:04.542
Tricky impalement.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.111
And his captain called in
Squad 3 to make sure

14:07.113 --> 14:08.279
it was handled correctly.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.981
- On my understanding, it was.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.517
- Yes, and we were
grateful for that.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.319
Then your Lieutenant

14:14.321 --> 14:16.087
overstepped his bounds,

14:16.089 --> 14:17.989
started nosing around

14:17.991 --> 14:20.625
and slinging accusations
at my men.

14:20.627 --> 14:22.060
So here's the deal.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.928
You run your house.
I'll run mine.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.597
- Look, I am happy to have
this conversation with you,

14:25.599 --> 14:28.166
Burwell, but after you
have dialed it back.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.070
- [laughing]

14:32.072 --> 14:34.305
I said
what I came here to say.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.110
Keep your men in line, Boden.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.522
- Connie.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.091
Get me Severide.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.664
- I'm not playing
private eye here, Chief.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.499
I'm just filing my report.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.369
But there is a firefighter
lying in a coma at Chicago Med.

15:04.371 --> 15:08.039
Does seem important
to get the details right.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.275
- Are you sure that Cruz
saw the ladder in place

15:10.277 --> 15:12.410
before it was moved?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.145
- I trust my man.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.486
- Then you write your report

15:21.488 --> 15:24.589
however you see fit.

15:24.591 --> 15:27.392
- Thank you, Chief.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.426
- Yeah.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.569
- Can I help you?

15:38.571 --> 15:41.339
- I'm looking for you, actually.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.607
Rich Corbin.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.641
- Matt Casey.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.676
- I know.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.177
I caught your little
speech last night.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.946
Pretty good stuff.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.080
- Thanks.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.248
What can I do for you?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.582
- Mr. Casey, I represent a group

15:51.584 --> 15:53.117
of civic-minded Chicagoans

15:53.119 --> 15:54.652
looking for a fresh face to back

15:54.654 --> 15:56.521
in the local political
landscape.

15:56.523 --> 15:57.956
- Okay.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.158
And who are these people?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.426
- Names you'd recognize--

16:01.428 --> 16:04.529
usually see them on the sides
of museums, hospitals,

16:04.531 --> 16:05.663
university buildings.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.065
- Mm-hmm.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.499
- I tried to track down
your campaign office,

16:08.501 --> 16:10.068
but I couldn't find
your website.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.537
- I--yeah,
it's a work in progress.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.138
I've set up a campaign fund,

16:14.140 --> 16:15.440
but the rest of it is--

16:15.442 --> 16:19.310
- Then consider this your
first campaign contribution.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.252
- Is this even legal?

16:28.254 --> 16:30.521
- Perfectly.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.323
- What's the catch?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.491
- No catch.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.027
Come meet the group.
Shake a few hands.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.462
Pose for a selfie or two.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.097
Butter them up,
and you'll be able

16:39.099 --> 16:41.132
to afford a slick
new website in no time.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.670
Give me a call.
Set something up.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.038
- All right.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.039
Thanks.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.407
- Thank you.

16:52.678 --> 16:53.745
[knocking on door]

16:56.281 --> 16:57.482
- You writing up the call?

16:57.484 --> 16:59.083
- Yep.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.152
Aerial was set up
for a pipe drill.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.060
I don't feel right about putting
you in the middle of this.

17:09.062 --> 17:11.262
The position of the aerial--

17:11.264 --> 17:13.031
it wasn't part of our rescue,

17:13.033 --> 17:16.734
so maybe we don't
put it in, you know?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.236
- You sure about what you saw?

17:18.238 --> 17:20.171
- 100%.
- Then that's how we file it.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.683
- Richter's gonna get pretty
jammed up over this, huh?

17:32.685 --> 17:34.318
- Getting cold feet, Cruz?

17:34.320 --> 17:35.820
- No, I just, uh--
- Good.

17:35.822 --> 17:36.821
Then get back to work.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.823
Let me fill out the damn report.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.803
- All right, Otis.
Head on up.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.810
- Okay, what the hell is this?

17:58.812 --> 18:01.179
You squad guys
are using our truck?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.547
- Otis said it was okay.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.615
- Oh, well, gee.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.285
Just make sure you
get it back by midnight.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.352
- Yeah, yeah.

18:13.692 --> 18:14.759
- Now what?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.094
- Get on the roof.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.566
- You got to get me closer.

18:21.568 --> 18:24.135
- You can't just hop
onto the roof from there?

18:24.137 --> 18:25.803
- Oh, I suppose I could try,

18:25.805 --> 18:27.738
if I had a death wish.

18:38.183 --> 18:39.617
- What are you doing?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.385
- You had the O2 tank
on the stretcher

18:41.387 --> 18:43.154
inside of secured
in the side compartment.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.455
- Because that's where
I like it.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.325
- Oh, sure, you don't mind it
flying around the rig, right?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.326
What do you care?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.327
Zooming about, and then--

18:49.329 --> 18:50.628
oh!

18:50.630 --> 18:52.296
And if I was an infant,

18:52.298 --> 18:53.498
I'd be dead right now.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.466
- I don't leave it there
when there are patients

18:55.468 --> 18:56.467
in the rig.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.835
[alarm blares]

18:57.837 --> 19:00.438
<i>- Ambulance 61, pedestrian</i>
<i>struck by an automobile</i>

19:00.440 --> 19:02.240
<i>at 42228 16th Street.</i>

19:02.242 --> 19:04.142
- Apology accepted.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.196
How can you make
a truck on the street

19:25.198 --> 19:26.898
feel like a boat on the ocean?

19:29.434 --> 19:31.736
- I've gone blind!
Help me, I'm blind!

19:31.738 --> 19:32.904
- Easy, easy, easy, easy.

19:32.906 --> 19:38.543
- So did you go blind
before or after

19:38.545 --> 19:41.546
- I never looked at my phone.

19:41.548 --> 19:42.713
It's like someone suddenly
turned off the lights.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.748
I couldn't see anything.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.950
- That maniac
came out of nowhere!

19:45.952 --> 19:47.818
Ellen, I didn't see him.
I'm so sorry.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.554
- Stop, Gerald.
It wasn't your fault.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.888
- Okay, you two.
My name is Sylvie.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.857
So I'm just gonna take
a look back here, all right?

19:52.859 --> 19:53.958
Have you been conscious
the whole time?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.293
- Yes.

19:55.295 --> 19:58.563
- I think it's mostly my ankle.

19:58.565 --> 19:59.697
- He could've killed her.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.798
- You know what?
He's right.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.433
You're a very lucky
woman, Ellen.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.568
All right.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.604
- [grunts]

20:06.606 --> 20:09.307
Oh!

20:09.309 --> 20:10.975
- It's not pretty,
but the doctors

20:10.977 --> 20:13.644
will be able to fix that
ankle right up, all right?

20:13.646 --> 20:14.912
- His pupils are responsive.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.380
- That's 'cause
he's full of it.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.516
This is reckless driving,
plain and simple.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.318
Come on, let me have him.
- Excuse me one second.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.587
- Hey, is it okay with you
if I do my job?

20:22.589 --> 20:24.522
What he's describing
is entirely possible.

20:24.524 --> 20:27.325
Sudden blindness can indicate
a major medical condition,

20:27.327 --> 20:29.894
like stroke or a lurking
brain tumor.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.929
- [clears throat]
So sorry to interrupt,

20:31.931 --> 20:33.598
but I have
a serious issue myself.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.399
Um, Ogle, will you take
a look at my chest,

20:35.401 --> 20:36.767
because I didn't
layer up properly,

20:36.769 --> 20:38.569
and I'm afraid that
I'm getting frostbite.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.837
[unzips coat]

20:39.839 --> 20:42.707
Yeah, sudden blindness cured.
[zips coat]

20:42.709 --> 20:43.908
- No, I--I--

20:43.910 --> 20:45.476
maybe the shock
made my sight come back.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.412
- All right,
let's go, buddy.

20:48.414 --> 20:49.547
- All right, let's get
the actual victims

20:49.549 --> 20:50.982
back to the ambulance.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.484
- Hey, you know, I'd be happy to
take a look at that frostbite

20:53.486 --> 20:55.519
for you once we get back
to the rig.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.625
- Hey, I've been
looking for you.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.460
Is this for real?
You're leaving?

21:02.462 --> 21:03.861
- Yeah, I guess it is.

21:07.532 --> 21:09.033
You okay?

21:09.035 --> 21:11.035
- Chili pushed me to my limit

21:11.037 --> 21:12.436
and then flamed out.

21:12.438 --> 21:14.305
Ogle is inciting me to violence,

21:14.307 --> 21:15.606
and now you're leaving,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.508
so no, I'm not okay.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.844
And FYI, neither are you.

21:19.846 --> 21:20.978
- Okay.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.947
- I mean, have you
even called Chili?

21:22.949 --> 21:24.382
Because I've left her
five messages,

21:24.384 --> 21:26.584
and she won't call me back.

21:26.586 --> 21:27.718
- Same here.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.987
But I hear she's doing okay.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.423
- Well, it'd be nice
to hear it from her.

21:32.425 --> 21:36.027
- Yeah, but maybe she needs
to be looking forward, you know?

21:36.029 --> 21:37.595
Not back.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.667
- Jimmy Borrelli, I'm gonna
tell you something,

21:42.669 --> 21:45.336
because there is no point
in holding it back now.

21:45.338 --> 21:46.737
I've had a huge thing for you

21:46.739 --> 21:51.375
And who knows what would've
happened if you'd stayed?

21:51.377 --> 21:52.476
Who knows?

21:52.478 --> 21:54.845
- I'm--I'm flattered.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.747
- Good, yeah.
You should be.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.689
- All right, so before
we all head off of shift,

22:04.691 --> 22:05.890
let's grab some of these

22:05.892 --> 22:08.759
and get as many signatures
as we possibly can.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.328
- From registered voters.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.096
- So here, take one
of these, too.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.835
CFD property, right?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.638
- Guys, you don't
have to do this.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.606
- But he really appreciates it,

22:22.608 --> 22:24.475
and he's meeting with
community leaders tonight,

22:24.477 --> 22:27.611
so the momentum is building.

22:27.613 --> 22:28.813
- [sighs]

22:28.815 --> 22:30.014
[pens clattering]

22:30.016 --> 22:31.949
Chief Boden
is looking for Jimmy.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.485
- Uh, last I saw him,
he was in the bunk room.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.556
- What was that about?

22:38.558 --> 22:39.623
- No idea.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.660
[knocking on door]

22:42.662 --> 22:44.462
- Jimmy, close the door.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.835
- What's up, Chief?

22:50.837 --> 22:53.604
- Um, I may have
found a solution

22:53.606 --> 22:55.740
to keeping you at 51.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.007
- You're kidding.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.076
Yes, yes--whatever it is,
my answer is yes.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.778
- Hear me out first.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.813
So we had a young firefighter

23:02.815 --> 23:05.616
who suffered an injury
while on the job.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.017
Couldn't get cleared
for squad duty,

23:07.019 --> 23:09.053
but he was a qualified
paramedic.

23:11.823 --> 23:13.090
As are you.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.494
- I'm loving the idea already.

23:16.496 --> 23:18.162
- We could detail you
on Ambulance 61

23:18.164 --> 23:20.898
on a kind of open-ended
thing.

23:20.900 --> 23:23.667
- I will stay there as long
as you want, Chief.

23:25.604 --> 23:27.104
and it seems like
the more that I learn

23:27.106 --> 23:30.875
about all the different
roles and responsibilities--

23:30.877 --> 23:33.444
I mean, the sky's
the limit, right?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.882
- Well, that settles that,
then.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.584
- Um, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna go tell the guys.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.019
- Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
Go on.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.654
Get out of here.

23:45.824 --> 23:47.892
- Hey, man of the hour.

23:47.894 --> 23:50.161
- Wasn't sure this was
the right place.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.896
Your community leaders
are inside?

23:51.898 --> 23:53.631
- They are.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.865
- So how's this work?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.033
- No big mystery.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.568
These folks all wield
a lot of influence

23:57.570 --> 23:58.803
in the neighborhood,
so they just want to,

23:58.805 --> 23:59.837
you know, get to know you,

23:59.839 --> 24:01.205
see where you stand
on the issues.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.674
And you win them over,
you earn their trust,

24:03.676 --> 24:05.910
they'll deliver votes--
hundreds of them.

24:05.912 --> 24:06.911
Local race like this,

24:06.913 --> 24:09.647
that could make
all the difference.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.816
- What's in it for you?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.617
- It's time to put
some good out there, man.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.719
Put good out,
you get good back.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.488
Savvy question, though.
I like that.

24:17.490 --> 24:18.489
- Okay.

24:18.491 --> 24:19.590
I'll listen.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.459
- Good, 'cause
I'm freezing my ass off.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.160
- [laughing]
- Right this way.

24:24.963 --> 24:26.931
Guys.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.866
Meet Matt Casey.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.801
He's running for alderman
of our fair Ward.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.841
- How you doing?
Dante.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.242
- Yeah.

24:38.244 --> 24:39.910
Yeah, I know who you are.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.013
Two years ago,
my truck responded

24:43.015 --> 24:45.115
to a fire at a pawn shop

24:45.117 --> 24:46.650
up the street.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.053
Turned out to be
gang headquarters.

24:50.922 --> 24:53.524
- Don't remember that.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.926
- This guy runs
the 24th Street Disciples.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.761
- Dante's out of
the gang life, Matt.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.030
None of these guys
are active anymore.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.499
But they're still connected.

25:01.501 --> 25:03.634
They're still respected
in the streets.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.002
That's why you need them.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.737
- And you get elected,

25:06.739 --> 25:08.739
you got to serve all the people,

25:08.741 --> 25:11.909
not just the ones
you approve of.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.711
We don't bite.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.246
We just want to talk to you
about some things

25:15.248 --> 25:16.780
that matters to us, you know?

25:16.782 --> 25:18.148
To our neighborhood.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.586
- Okay.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.054
[clears throat]

25:24.056 --> 25:27.758
Like, uh, what, specifically?

25:27.760 --> 25:31.061
- Like, what do you intend
to do about police harassment?

25:31.063 --> 25:33.964
- I'll hold the police
accountable--

25:33.966 --> 25:38.702
make sure there's specific,
independent oversight.

25:38.704 --> 25:39.970
- Okay.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.105
- What else?

25:47.979 --> 25:49.680
- We need you to get
the police cameras

25:49.682 --> 25:51.982
off the corner of
Richmond and Augusta.

25:56.721 --> 25:57.955
- [sighs]

25:57.957 --> 25:59.957
Listen, uh...

25:59.959 --> 26:01.959
thanks for your time, gentlemen,

26:01.961 --> 26:04.662
but, um...

26:04.664 --> 26:07.798
I don't think I'm the candidate
you're looking for.

26:09.100 --> 26:11.902
- Just hold on.
- You got the wrong guy.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.637
- It's cool, you know.
No sweat.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.339
We just wanted to meet you,
you know.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.808
Hear what you're all about.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.910
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.812
You guys all have a good night.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.814
Okay?
Thank you.

26:37.028 --> 26:39.163
- Connor says McCormick
is still in a coma.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.799
Doctors don't know
what's going on.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.668
- Squad should swing by
next shift.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.737
Pay respects on behalf of 51.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.072
- Is Kelly Severide here?

26:50.842 --> 26:52.643
- That's Richter's ex,
Gretchen.

26:52.645 --> 26:53.811
- What's she doing here?

26:53.813 --> 26:55.779
- What are you doing, Kelly?

26:55.781 --> 26:56.780
The report your filed

26:56.782 --> 26:58.882
got Kevin called in
to headquarters.

26:58.884 --> 27:00.651
They're saying
he could be suspended

27:00.653 --> 27:02.920
or even fired for
lying about the drill.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.054
- It was me.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.189
I told the lieutenant
that I noticed--

27:05.191 --> 27:06.790
- No, no.
Cruz, no.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.893
Look, Gretchen, we--
we talked to Kevin.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.328
Gave him a chance to set
the record straight.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.329
He wouldn't.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.131
- We had our differences,
me and Kevin.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.766
But I was married to the man,

27:15.768 --> 27:17.101
and I know him inside out.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.669
He wouldn't lie.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.070
You made a mistake.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.072
Just tell them.

27:22.074 --> 27:24.341
- Can't do that.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.377
- I'm responsible
for this whole mess.

27:26.379 --> 27:28.045
I need to make it right,

27:28.047 --> 27:30.347
and I can't do that
without your help.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.982
- Gretchen,

27:31.984 --> 27:35.219
this is not your fault.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.854
But it's not ours, either.

27:36.856 --> 27:40.724
What we put in that report
is the truth.

27:40.726 --> 27:43.427
- Are you really
so sure you're right?

27:43.429 --> 27:44.895
Because you are destroying

27:44.897 --> 27:48.732
a lot of people's
lives over this.

you try working with Ogle

out of my mind.

And I'm sorry.

28:34.714 --> 28:38.382

to apologize.

28:38.384 --> 28:42.352
- Can we just pretend
that never happened?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.421
- Totally.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.056
- Great,

28:46.058 --> 28:48.392
'cause, um, I think
this partnership

- Totally.

29:00.872 --> 29:03.240
- Okay, guys,
I got it, all right?

29:03.242 --> 29:04.775
This new guy from Auburn--

29:04.777 --> 29:06.977
we're gonna make his life
a living hell

29:06.979 --> 29:08.946
until he washes out
and requests a transfer.

29:08.948 --> 29:11.281
Then we get Jimmy back on Truck.

29:11.283 --> 29:13.450
- Eh, Jimmy sounded
pretty excited

29:13.452 --> 29:15.119
about working with Brett
on the ambulance.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.286
- No, no, no.

29:16.288 --> 29:17.454
We need Jimmy back on Truck,

29:17.456 --> 29:19.356
and this--this--

29:19.358 --> 29:21.825
is how we're gonna do it.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.026
- A stink bomb?

29:23.028 --> 29:25.362
- Doesn't seem like
much of a plan.

29:25.364 --> 29:26.530
- This is just the beginning.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.832
A stink bomb in
the turnout gear, ha ha.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.835
But then we proceed to
all the old standards:

the mousetrap in the locker,
right?

29:59.565 --> 30:01.532
This is too good to be true!

30:01.534 --> 30:03.300
- Oh, my God!

30:03.302 --> 30:05.969
Of course you're at 51.
Of course.

30:05.971 --> 30:06.970
- You guys are gonna
love this girl.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.872
This is amazing.
- [laughing]

- Oh, oh--
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.210
- Yeah, you could say that.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.279
for a few months after training

30:15.281 --> 30:18.048
before CFD decided we needed
to be separated.

a nasty influence.

- Ah, thank you.
Good to be here.

30:26.091 --> 30:28.358
- Hey, can we still do
the Toledo Twister?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.960
Come on.
All right.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.428
- Two broads on Truck?

30:31.430 --> 30:32.462
Aw...

30:32.464 --> 30:34.064
- Herrmann, come on.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.866
It's 2016, man.

30:42.307 --> 30:43.841
- Hey, we'll check in
at the nurses' station,

30:43.843 --> 30:44.975
get an update.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.483
How's McCormick doing?

30:53.485 --> 30:55.085
- Not so good.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.121
Still unconscious.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.957
- Sorry to hear that.
- [sighs]

30:59.959 --> 31:03.293
I've been suspended.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.628
And now all the guys
at the house

31:04.630 --> 31:06.496
are icing me out

31:06.498 --> 31:08.866
'cause they think I pushed him,

31:08.868 --> 31:12.002
and I'm here now
just for show.

31:12.004 --> 31:14.304
But none of that...

31:14.306 --> 31:16.907
none of it, you hear me,
is true.

31:24.349 --> 31:25.582
I lied.

31:27.919 --> 31:31.255
I was on the ladder
when he fell.

31:31.257 --> 31:32.556
- I know.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.392
- But I didn't
lay a hand on Mac.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.294
I swear, it just--

31:37.296 --> 31:39.129
he just lost his balance

31:39.131 --> 31:40.998
out of nowhere.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.332
And I knew no one
would believe me

31:42.334 --> 31:45.535
after all my threats.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.104
Why would anyone believe me?

31:51.910 --> 31:53.343
- Richter, come with me.
Come on.

31:56.281 --> 31:58.682
- Tell Dr. Rhodes
what you saw.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.618
- Well, McCormick was
a couple steps behind me.

32:01.620 --> 32:05.155
And he called out like
he was gonna say something,

32:05.157 --> 32:08.492
and then he just started
grabbing at the air

32:08.494 --> 32:10.294
and just fell.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.995
- I had a firefighter
under my command

32:11.997 --> 32:12.996
do the same thing.

32:12.998 --> 32:14.164
Guy named Mills.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.399
Lost his balance
out of the blue.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.466
Turns out it was ear damage

32:16.468 --> 32:18.368
from an explosion
a few weeks before.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.337
- This could be
an underlying condition.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.105
I wish we had known
about this sooner,

32:22.107 --> 32:24.675
but we'll get him
right into a CAT scan.

32:27.578 --> 32:29.980
- So what have you
heard about 51?

32:29.982 --> 32:32.115
- Uh, well,

32:32.117 --> 32:34.117
I heard you all live together.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.118
- What?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.653
We don't all live together.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.256
I live with Joe Cruz,

32:39.258 --> 32:41.391
and Brett and Dawson
are roomies.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.661
And Casey and Severide
have a place.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.129
- It's cool.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.332
Just don't rope me
into your love shack.

32:48.334 --> 32:49.399
I just split with my hubby,

32:49.401 --> 32:52.569
- You and Grant split up?

32:52.571 --> 32:54.972
- Took me six years,
but finally I was like,

32:54.974 --> 32:56.406
"Why am I taking care
of this guy?"

32:56.408 --> 32:58.575
You know, why do I want
to grow old with somebody

32:58.577 --> 33:00.410
who's never gonna grow up?

33:00.412 --> 33:02.245
So pulled the plug.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.680
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.415
Go out whenever I want.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.551
I eat at nice restaurants.

33:07.553 --> 33:09.987
And then if I'm ever lonely,
I just sleep with my ex.

33:11.422 --> 33:14.424
- You sleep with your--

33:14.426 --> 33:16.259
and he's okay with that?

33:16.261 --> 33:18.729
- Yeah, why wouldn't he be?
It's win-win.

33:18.731 --> 33:20.530
[alarm blares]

33:20.532 --> 33:22.366
<i>- Engine 51, Truck 81,</i>

33:22.368 --> 33:23.767
<i>Ambulance 61,</i>
<i>Battalion 25.</i>

33:23.769 --> 33:27.170
- All right!
Show me what you got, 51!

33:41.185 --> 33:43.520
[indistinct chatter]

33:46.424 --> 33:48.425
- 51, get a line in there.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.327
81, vent the roof!
- <i>Copy that, Chief.</i>

33:52.497 --> 33:53.730
- I don't know how
it happened!

33:53.732 --> 33:55.532
- Don't talk.
Slow, deep breaths.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.367
- [hacking]
- 61, get her some oxygen.

33:57.369 --> 33:58.368
- Already got it.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.669
- Herrmann, mask up.

33:59.671 --> 34:00.771
We're going in.
- Right.

34:00.773 --> 34:03.340
Hey, Lieutenant, over here.
- Hey!

34:03.342 --> 34:04.808
- Can I get a shot for
my campaign piece?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.810
- Stand aside.
Get out of the way.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.246
Stand aside, get out the way!

34:09.248 --> 34:13.116
- [coughing]

34:13.118 --> 34:14.818
Dave!

34:14.820 --> 34:15.819
Where's Bobby?

34:15.821 --> 34:16.820
- I thought he was with you!

34:16.822 --> 34:17.821
- Oh, my God!

34:20.758 --> 34:22.292
- Kidd.
- Yeah?

34:22.294 --> 34:23.560
- Get the rear door.
- All right.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.594
Got it.

34:27.198 --> 34:28.465
- Hey! Hey!

34:34.505 --> 34:37.274
- Sorry, but you do not
want to go back in there!

34:37.276 --> 34:38.408
- Let me go!
I got to get Bobby!

34:38.410 --> 34:40.177
- We can't just leave him there!

34:40.179 --> 34:41.812
- All right, stay put,
the both of you.

34:41.814 --> 34:42.813
We're going in.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.548
- Don't have much time, 81.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.149
<i>Structure's about ready</i>
<i>to go.</i>

34:46.151 --> 34:57.427
- Bobby?

35:00.832 --> 35:02.599
- Fire department!

35:02.601 --> 35:04.167
Call out!

35:05.670 --> 35:07.170
- Oh, my God, poor Bobby.

35:07.172 --> 35:08.572
- Don't worry,
they're gonna find your boy.

35:08.574 --> 35:09.573
- Boy?
No, no, no, no.

35:09.575 --> 35:11.108
- No, Bobby is our cat.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.710
You've got to tell them
they're looking for a cat.

35:16.347 --> 35:18.181
- Chief, we got a problem.

35:20.351 --> 35:22.419
<i>- 81, come on out.</i>

35:22.421 --> 35:25.288
<i>We've confirmed that there are</i>
<i>no more victims inside.</i>

35:25.290 --> 35:27.524
<i>51, back that line out.</i>

35:27.526 --> 35:29.392
<i>We're gonna fight it</i>
<i>from the outside.</i>

35:29.394 --> 35:30.594
- Copy that, Chief.

35:30.596 --> 35:32.262
Turn it around.

35:34.732 --> 35:37.134
[distant meow]

35:40.571 --> 35:44.141
[meowing]

35:44.143 --> 35:47.444
Let me guess, Bobby?

35:47.446 --> 35:48.578
Here, boy.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.525
- Where's Casey?

36:03.528 --> 36:05.195
- Damn it.

36:05.197 --> 36:06.630
- Casey, what's the holdup?

36:09.901 --> 36:11.635
Herrmann.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.702
Stay where you are.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.604
Casey, report.

36:17.375 --> 36:18.842
- Why are they coming back out?

36:18.844 --> 36:20.410
What about Bobby?

36:20.412 --> 36:23.513
- Ma'am I can't risk
my men's lives for a cat.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.182
- They went in after a cat?

36:28.653 --> 36:30.887
- Casey!
Get out, now!

36:35.459 --> 36:36.893
- [sighs]
Thank God.

36:37.895 --> 36:39.529
- Son of a bitch, he's got it!

36:39.531 --> 36:41.431
- I told you to step back.

36:41.433 --> 36:42.566
- What, just--

36:42.568 --> 36:44.534
- Come on, let's go.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.870
- Okay, fire up
the water cannons.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.205
- Yeah, boys!

36:49.607 --> 36:52.742
- [crying]

36:59.517 --> 37:01.518
- If I'm showing up
at your house,

37:01.520 --> 37:03.820
it's usually the worst
day of your life.

37:03.822 --> 37:05.655
You're hurt,
or your home is on fire,

37:05.657 --> 37:07.524
or somebody you love
is in danger.

37:07.526 --> 37:10.994
And yeah, sometimes
it's too late to help.

37:10.996 --> 37:13.597
But if I'm also an alderman,

37:13.599 --> 37:16.900
maybe I can help people before
their lives are in crisis.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.501
- That's a beautiful
sentiment.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.803
- You keep talking like that,

37:19.805 --> 37:21.671
you're going to win over
a lot of people.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.839
- I mean it.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.341
I really do.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.909
- Even better.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.344
- Thanks, guys.
- Great evening.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.946
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice meeting you.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.481
- What did I tell you?

37:31.483 --> 37:33.650
Just be yourself, and they'll
fall in love with you.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.785
Before I introduce you
to this next guy--

37:35.787 --> 37:36.820
you're in construction, right?

37:36.822 --> 37:38.021
- Mm-hmm.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.924
- You aware of the situation
with Racine Development?

37:40.926 --> 37:42.859
- Not really, no.

37:42.861 --> 37:45.862
- City's refusing to rezone
a couple blocks in Pilsen,

37:45.864 --> 37:47.464
and it'd really tip the scale

37:47.466 --> 37:50.634
if we had a friend
on the council.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.702
- Well, I--
I haven't been elected yet,

37:52.704 --> 37:55.939
but, um, I'll keep it in mind.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.607
- We're gonna help you
get elected.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.377
And we hope you help us
rezone a block or two

38:02.313 --> 38:04.814
Everybody wins.

38:04.816 --> 38:05.949
- Like I said,

38:05.951 --> 38:07.417
I'll keep it in mind.

38:07.419 --> 38:08.752
- Good.

38:11.856 --> 38:13.423
- Once they got Eddie
in the scanner,

38:13.425 --> 38:15.625
they found a blockage
of his left main artery.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.827
It was cutting off the oxygen
to his brain.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.496
It's why he fell.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.563
- Wow.

38:20.565 --> 38:21.631
- But they did an angioplasty,

38:21.633 --> 38:23.033
and it sounds like it went well.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.734
He got out about an hour ago.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.569
- That's great.
That's good news.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.471
- Kelly...

38:28.473 --> 38:32.375
they call that kind of blockage
a "widow-maker."

38:32.377 --> 38:34.010
If they hadn't found it,

38:34.012 --> 38:36.579
Eddie could've been dead
within a week.

38:36.581 --> 38:40.383
- They did.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.719
- I know.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.087
Thank you.

38:44.089 --> 38:46.089
- Gretchen?

38:46.091 --> 38:49.592
Eddie just woke up.

38:49.594 --> 38:51.328
- Oh, my God.

38:51.330 --> 38:54.097
- He's alert,
and he wants to see you.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.899
- Go see him.

38:55.901 --> 38:56.966
- Come on.

39:06.110 --> 39:08.545
- I owe you one, Severide.

39:08.547 --> 39:10.113
- Nah, it all worked out.

39:10.115 --> 39:11.781
- I've been suspended
for a month

39:11.783 --> 39:13.750
for lying about the accident...

39:15.820 --> 39:18.788
Which is fair.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.857
Mac's gonna make it.

39:20.859 --> 39:23.993
That's what matters.

39:23.995 --> 39:26.062
- You're damn right.

39:34.372 --> 39:37.507
- So my girl Dawson

39:37.509 --> 39:39.075
is sleeping with
the lieutenant.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.478
Well, yeah, figures you didn't
get on Truck legit,

39:41.480 --> 39:42.846
like I did.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.881
- Lieutenant
and future alderman.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.750
- Oh.
- So do me proud at 51,

39:46.752 --> 39:49.619
or I can get you fired
and have O'Hare's flight path

39:49.621 --> 39:51.388
rerouted over your bedroom.

39:54.592 --> 39:56.593
- [sighs]

39:56.595 --> 39:58.561
[laughing]

39:58.563 --> 40:00.029
- Hey, Kidd.

40:00.031 --> 40:01.598
- Hey.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.733
- How was your first shift?

40:03.735 --> 40:05.802
- It was good.
It was--it was real good.

40:08.005 --> 40:09.472
- Um...

40:09.474 --> 40:10.874
does anyone know,

40:10.876 --> 40:12.709
from 51?

40:12.711 --> 40:15.745
Uh, Dawson...
- No.

40:15.747 --> 40:17.614
No, no.
I never said a word.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.152
- Cool, uh...

40:24.989 --> 40:27.724
Okay.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.959
- Good night.

40:29.961 --> 40:31.961
[laughing]

40:42.907 --> 40:45.175
- Hey.
- Congratulations, Matt.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.810
I just heard from
the Board of Elections.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.945
You got enough signatures.
You're on the ballot.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.781
Wow.
Ha!

40:51.783 --> 40:53.016
Guess I am.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.852
- I was sorry to see you
cut out early from the party.

40:55.854 --> 40:56.920
I wanted to talk
a little bit more

40:56.922 --> 40:58.955
about that Racine thing.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.658
- Rich, if I'm elected,

41:01.660 --> 41:04.027
I promise to look into it

41:04.029 --> 41:06.162
and vote whichever way
feels right to me,

41:06.164 --> 41:08.832
regardless of who contributed
what to my campaign.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.733
I'm sorry if that seems blunt,

41:10.735 --> 41:14.204
but, hey...
I'm a straight shooter.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.872
- Well, I'm a straight shooter
too, Matt.

41:15.874 --> 41:19.142
So I'll lay it out.

41:19.144 --> 41:20.543
Do you think I came to you

41:20.545 --> 41:23.112
because I swooned over
your ideals?

41:23.114 --> 41:25.014
No, I sought you out because

41:25.016 --> 41:26.916
I think with a little help,

41:26.918 --> 41:28.685
you can win this thing.

41:28.687 --> 41:29.919
But if I don't get
some assurance

41:29.921 --> 41:31.621
that you appreciate my help,

41:31.623 --> 41:32.856
it's no big deal.

41:32.858 --> 41:36.259
I'll just throw my support
behind Alderman Becks...

41:36.261 --> 41:38.495
and make damn sure
he destroys you.

41:40.731 --> 41:43.633
- [chuckles]
Yeah...

41:43.635 --> 41:46.102
- Welcome to politics, Matt.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.839
- Hey, uh, Rich?

41:49.841 --> 41:52.642
Get the hell out of my bar.
