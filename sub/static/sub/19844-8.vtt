WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:04.884
of this cursed rosebush is there?

00:04.887 --> 00:06.520
Enough to kill you

00:06.523 --> 00:09.000
and your whole family ten times over.

00:09.003 --> 00:11.233
The Ancestors are gone.
We need a new strategy.

00:11.235 --> 00:12.500
To keep the Hollow at bay.

00:12.502 --> 00:13.635
We blew up the link that allows 'em

00:13.637 --> 00:14.807
to access this world,

00:14.810 --> 00:16.710
but if there's a shred of Davina left

00:16.713 --> 00:18.012
over there, then...

00:18.015 --> 00:19.753
she can accept the sacrifice

00:19.756 --> 00:21.409
and restore the link.

00:21.411 --> 00:23.546
Do you really think that
weapon can kill Marcel?

00:23.549 --> 00:25.580
It will be powerful enough to kill him.

00:25.582 --> 00:28.250
The Hollow has been haunting
the city for a very long time.

00:28.252 --> 00:31.253
It's looking for something.
Four things, by the sound of it.

00:31.255 --> 00:33.521
And I'm pretty sure
that I have one of 'em.

00:33.523 --> 00:35.390
When a witch wishes to be reborn,

00:35.392 --> 00:37.359
its remains are required
to complete the spell.

00:37.361 --> 00:39.055
You've just found a piece of our enemy.

00:39.058 --> 00:40.895
Who has the other three?

00:40.897 --> 00:43.598
Dominic said that he
had found something here.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.800
The Tunde Blade...

00:45.802 --> 00:47.360
It's gone.

00:47.363 --> 00:49.419
I've been tracking the
lineage. Entrusted to be

00:49.421 --> 00:51.973
the guardians of a bone,
like Hayley's family.

00:55.026 --> 00:56.626
Tyler Lockwood.

00:56.629 --> 00:58.796
So the bones are in Mystic Falls.

00:58.799 --> 01:00.763
This thing has followers everywhere.

01:00.766 --> 01:02.674
If they get to the other
bones before we do...

01:02.677 --> 01:05.373
Then they will try to
raise this monstrosity,

01:05.376 --> 01:07.176
and it will come for us all.

01:07.179 --> 01:09.112
Do you know who I am?

01:10.451 --> 01:13.763
You will give me a safe place to hide.

01:21.860 --> 01:24.751

Hope, what's going on?

03:05.811 --> 03:07.444
Mom?

03:07.446 --> 03:10.013
Can you hear them, too?

03:12.618 --> 03:14.050
What's going on?

03:14.052 --> 03:16.419
Look at me. Tell me what you heard.

03:16.421 --> 03:20.790
Voices. They said that we're
connected to this. You and me.

03:22.510 --> 03:24.143
If this fossil has been whispering lies,

03:24.146 --> 03:25.760
I'll gladly throw it in the river.

03:25.762 --> 03:27.295
No. Not the bone.

03:27.297 --> 03:30.365
The witches. The Ancestors.

03:32.102 --> 03:35.069
They have a message for us.

03:35.071 --> 03:36.905
A warning.

03:36.907 --> 03:38.873
- Tell me what they said.
- They want you

03:38.875 --> 03:41.409
to go to St. Anne's
Church to talk to them.

03:41.411 --> 03:43.478
They said you have to
do exactly what they say,

03:43.480 --> 03:44.946
and you have to do it now.

03:46.716 --> 03:49.818
Before the Hollow comes for us.

03:59.529 --> 04:00.962
You need to relax.

04:00.965 --> 04:03.513
I'm on my way to New Orleans right now.

04:03.516 --> 04:05.500
And I have good news.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.836
I went through the remains
of the Lockwood estate,

04:07.838 --> 04:11.039
and I found you one creepy-ass,

04:11.041 --> 04:13.508
ancient finger bone.

04:13.510 --> 04:14.876
Your efforts are appreciated.

04:14.878 --> 04:16.678
Now, if you could only pick up the pace.

04:16.680 --> 04:19.714
Easy, Klaus. The only reason I'm heading

04:19.716 --> 04:22.617
your way is because I don't want
you anywhere near Mystic Falls.

04:22.619 --> 04:24.853
Things tend to get
murder-y when you're around.

04:24.855 --> 04:26.454
Well, that's a fair point.

04:26.456 --> 04:29.057
Now, Alaric, if our pleasantries
have run their course...

04:29.059 --> 04:31.125
Oh, hey, listen, one more thing.

04:31.127 --> 04:33.461
The Lockwoods, they didn't
just safeguard the bone...

04:33.463 --> 04:35.964
They kept records with
names, dates and locations.

04:35.966 --> 04:38.333
Turns out they had
knowledge of other families

04:38.335 --> 04:40.668
that were charged with guarding
the rest of the remains.

04:40.670 --> 04:43.505
Now, does the name Labonair
mean anything to you?

04:44.661 --> 04:47.462
- It's familiar, yeah.
- Well, good.

04:47.465 --> 04:50.032
That might be a lead to help
you find the rest of the remains.

04:50.035 --> 04:51.679
Which you'll have to do yourself,

04:51.681 --> 04:55.650
because my days of
fighting monsters are over.

04:55.652 --> 04:57.452
Okay, so here's the deal...

04:57.454 --> 05:01.689
I will be at Jack's Bar-B-Q
Shack off Route 59 until 2:00.

05:01.691 --> 05:05.593
If you're not there by 2:10, I
chuck the bone and the records

05:05.595 --> 05:07.128
in a Dumpster and I'm gone.

05:07.130 --> 05:09.664
And then you can fish them
out of the trash yourself.

05:09.666 --> 05:11.633
Well, I'm afraid I'll
be otherwise occupied,

05:11.635 --> 05:13.635
so you'll be meeting
Elijah. And if, perchance,

05:13.637 --> 05:16.782
he's running late, I suggest
you exercise some patience

05:16.785 --> 05:18.206
and have yourself a beer.

05:18.208 --> 05:22.043
Otherwise, you'll have a few
more monsters to worry about.

05:25.415 --> 05:27.181
Please don't go.

05:27.183 --> 05:30.251
The whole point of you
going to Vincent was to get

05:30.253 --> 05:32.620
the Ancestors on our
side. Find the bones,

05:32.622 --> 05:34.419
stop the Hollow from
getting her body back...

05:34.422 --> 05:35.356
Why are you doing this?

05:35.358 --> 05:37.091
Because they've asked me to.

05:37.093 --> 05:38.993
Who else is gonna go, you?

05:38.995 --> 05:41.930
You slit the throats of four witches.

05:41.932 --> 05:43.598
That was a necessity.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.433
Really? Was it?

05:45.435 --> 05:48.503
'Cause it seems like
there's always some necessity

05:48.505 --> 05:49.743
for some awful thing.

05:49.746 --> 05:52.373
We are at war with a
creature we barely understand.

05:52.375 --> 05:53.775
That's the point.

05:53.777 --> 05:55.476
We don't understand this thing

05:55.478 --> 05:57.412
or how to stop it.

05:57.414 --> 06:00.148
But one thing is for
sure... We need help.

06:00.150 --> 06:02.016
And I'm gonna go get it.

06:03.787 --> 06:06.788
She's not wrong.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.923
We do need allies.

06:08.925 --> 06:10.992
While we appeal to the local spirits,

06:10.994 --> 06:12.727
you and Marcel should marshal forces.

06:12.729 --> 06:13.737
I beg your pardon.

06:13.740 --> 06:16.230
We are in a race to find those bones.

06:16.232 --> 06:17.665
Marcel knows the city.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.801
He's the enemy of our enemy.

06:21.237 --> 06:24.272
Look, perhaps it's time to mend bridges,

06:24.274 --> 06:26.240
rather than throw people off them.

06:26.242 --> 06:27.675
Hmm?

06:32.048 --> 06:34.782
We got one priority today,

06:34.784 --> 06:37.552
keep the Hollow from getting
her hands on the last two bones.

06:37.554 --> 06:40.388
The Mikaelsons got one,
the Hollow's got another.

06:40.390 --> 06:42.957
Which is why we're gonna check
with every antique dealer,

06:42.959 --> 06:44.859
junk collector, and local historian

06:44.861 --> 06:46.794
until we control the final pieces.

06:46.796 --> 06:49.631
Now, if this vile spirit gets
her hands on the bones first,

06:49.633 --> 06:52.200
she'll be impossible to kill.

06:52.202 --> 06:55.203
This is old magic. The
covens can't stop it.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.638
But that is our city.

06:56.640 --> 06:58.873
All right? We protect it,
no matter what we got to do

06:58.875 --> 07:00.441
or who we got to kill.

07:00.443 --> 07:03.611
We've had five years
of peace, and I intend

07:03.613 --> 07:06.614
to keep it that way,
but I need your help.

07:06.616 --> 07:08.616
All right?

07:08.618 --> 07:10.852
Now get out there. Go get 'em.

07:19.963 --> 07:22.497
I have been looking everywhere for you.

07:22.499 --> 07:24.866
I'm flattered.

07:24.868 --> 07:27.335
But I had business to take care of.

07:27.337 --> 07:30.571
Klaus said you tried to rescue me.

07:30.573 --> 07:34.842
He also said your boy Dominic
was an acolyte of the Hollow.

07:34.844 --> 07:38.312
I only made a deal with
Dominic to try and save you.

07:38.314 --> 07:40.281
Now that you're back,

07:40.283 --> 07:43.985
I'd like to figure out how we
can put our problems to bed,

07:43.987 --> 07:46.287
once and for all.

07:52.696 --> 07:54.028
It's quiet.

07:54.030 --> 07:55.830
Of course it's quiet. It's a trap.

07:55.832 --> 07:58.066
- We don't know that.
- New Orleans witches

07:58.068 --> 08:00.497
have hated my family
for three centuries.

08:00.500 --> 08:01.769
Of course it's a trap.

08:01.771 --> 08:03.604
The coven protects their own.

08:03.606 --> 08:06.274
Hope's one of them now.
She's part of their legacy.

08:06.276 --> 08:09.277
Hope is a far cry from a
French Quarter fortune-teller.

08:09.279 --> 08:11.779
And while we're on the
subject, she's seven.

08:11.781 --> 08:14.348
If anyone wants to talk to her,
they should ask my permission.

08:14.350 --> 08:16.718
You're gonna be a lot of
fun when she starts dating.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.720
I'm gonna be a perfect gentleman.

08:18.722 --> 08:21.923
And should any of her suitors
fail to meet my expectations,

08:21.925 --> 08:24.926
I'll compel them to the priesthood.

08:26.763 --> 08:29.931
Oh, look, Harvest Girls.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.766
I assume you speak

08:31.768 --> 08:33.234
on behalf of your Ancestors.

08:33.236 --> 08:35.135
Provided that you've come in peace.

08:35.138 --> 08:36.897
Well, that depends on you, doesn't it?

08:36.900 --> 08:38.033
We don't want a fight.

08:38.035 --> 08:39.941
We're here to offer a deal.

08:41.745 --> 08:44.378
Although your brother
did murder all four of us,

08:44.380 --> 08:46.547
so let's not pretend we're friends.

08:46.549 --> 08:49.684
Please consider all pretense
of friendship dropped.

08:49.686 --> 08:52.954
Where are the Ancestors?

08:52.956 --> 08:56.591
I'm sure your men will find the bones.

08:56.593 --> 09:00.628
By compulsion or alternative
forms of persuasion.

09:00.630 --> 09:03.431
Of course. Just takes time.

09:03.433 --> 09:06.033
Of which we have none.

09:07.504 --> 09:09.804
The hell are you doing here?

09:09.806 --> 09:11.172
We need to talk.

09:13.443 --> 09:15.476
If you wouldn't mind.

09:15.478 --> 09:18.279
Excuse us.

09:19.849 --> 09:21.816
Make it quick.

09:21.818 --> 09:23.651
I need your help.

09:23.653 --> 09:25.853
Meeting an expert shortly.

09:25.855 --> 09:28.656
He'll be coming by way of Mystic
Falls, carrying one of the bones

09:28.658 --> 09:30.423
and the means to find another.

09:30.426 --> 09:32.685
Between the three of us,
we should have those remains

09:32.688 --> 09:33.828
by sundown.

09:33.830 --> 09:35.530
Why should I trust you?

09:35.532 --> 09:37.799
For that matter, why would you trust me?

09:37.801 --> 09:39.634
I don't.

09:39.636 --> 09:42.069
But why should we let
old grievances hinder

09:42.071 --> 09:43.671
our common goal?

09:45.308 --> 09:47.508
Here's a proposal.

09:52.849 --> 09:55.116
You come with me,

09:55.118 --> 09:58.019
I surrender the only weapon
that can take your life.

10:11.301 --> 10:13.568
We need your blood.

10:13.570 --> 10:16.037
That's funny, I didn't
hear you say "please."

10:16.039 --> 10:19.273
If you want answers, we have
to guide you to the Ancestors.

10:19.276 --> 10:22.454
- But since you aren't witches...
- We need to bend the rules.

10:22.457 --> 10:24.215
- How?
- Simple loophole.

10:24.218 --> 10:26.414
You're both bound by blood
to a New Orleans witch.

10:26.416 --> 10:29.283
We can use the link to
your child to cast a spell

10:29.285 --> 10:31.285
and link you to an
audience with the dead.

10:45.952 --> 10:48.836
Why do I get the feeling there's
something you're not mentioning?

10:48.838 --> 10:51.606
Just one thing... This is gonna hurt.

11:03.953 --> 11:06.387
Now can I be angry at them?

11:06.389 --> 11:08.356
Get angry later.

11:08.358 --> 11:10.538
We're here now. We may
as well get some answers.

11:10.541 --> 11:12.927
So are we to wander around
this dreary purgatory

11:12.929 --> 11:15.062
in search of lost souls?

11:22.071 --> 11:24.305
I wasn't sure you were gonna show up.

11:24.307 --> 11:26.707
Well, I'm full of surprises.

11:26.709 --> 11:29.610
I hope you intend to make
our trip worth the effort.

11:31.414 --> 11:34.075
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:36.653 --> 11:38.219
And you are gonna listen

11:38.221 --> 11:40.388
to every single word I have to say,

11:40.390 --> 11:42.290
because right now, I'm the only thing

11:42.292 --> 11:44.125
standing between you and the Hollow.

11:50.216 --> 11:53.649
How is Kol? Can't see anything
here except New Orleans.

11:53.651 --> 11:55.451
I believe he's currently traipsing

11:55.454 --> 11:57.753
through the French Riviera,
though I'm sure he'll return

11:57.755 --> 11:59.588
once I tell him how lovely you remain.

11:59.590 --> 12:01.323
- Death becomes you.
- Stop talking.

12:01.325 --> 12:03.191
Gladly... once she tells us something

12:03.193 --> 12:05.260
that could be of help,
because, as I recall,

12:05.262 --> 12:07.296
when Freya kicked her
into this drab shadowland,

12:07.298 --> 12:09.431
her brethren wanted to tear her apart.

12:09.433 --> 12:11.633
You want to defeat the Hollow. So do I.

12:11.635 --> 12:13.468
So do the Ancestors.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.737
But first you need to know
what you're up against.

12:18.042 --> 12:21.209
It begins a thousand years
before the city was founded.

12:21.211 --> 12:24.638
Two rival tribes decided
to combine their power.

12:24.641 --> 12:26.641
They thought that by uniting in peace,

12:26.644 --> 12:28.744
they would enter a new age of harmony.

12:28.747 --> 12:30.952
Ceccan ulanigv.

12:30.954 --> 12:32.788
A marriage was arranged.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.023
Two powerful witches joined together

12:35.025 --> 12:36.725
to create a unified coven.

12:36.727 --> 12:41.029
Ceccan ulanigv.

12:41.031 --> 12:45.033
Ceccan ulanigv.

12:45.035 --> 12:47.769
Ceccan ulanigv.

12:47.771 --> 12:49.638
A ceremonial wedding.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.040
Like the one Jack and I
had to unite our packs.

12:52.042 --> 12:53.408
Let me guess.

12:53.410 --> 12:54.843
Something went wrong.

12:54.845 --> 12:57.546
That marriage bore a child.

12:57.548 --> 13:00.682
Neltoca teoyohtica.

13:02.486 --> 13:06.221
Neltoca teoyohtica.

13:06.223 --> 13:10.792
For nine months, the tribe
elders visited the mother,

13:10.794 --> 13:14.029
using magic to grant
the child great power

13:14.031 --> 13:20.502
in hopes that the newborn would
become a symbol of prosperity.

13:32.483 --> 13:35.858
But they had no idea what they
were bringing into the world.

13:40.924 --> 13:43.125
She was named Inadu.

13:43.127 --> 13:44.893
Soon it was clear that she was stronger

13:44.895 --> 13:46.628
than anyone could imagine.

13:52.035 --> 13:54.903
And that she had a terrible
hunger for more power still.

13:54.905 --> 13:57.139
And that's how the Hollow was born.

13:57.141 --> 14:00.409
Well, this is all frightening
fodder for campfire tales,

14:00.411 --> 14:02.644
but how do we kill her?

14:02.646 --> 14:04.813
You don't understand.

14:04.815 --> 14:06.848
You can't.

14:21.265 --> 14:25.434
Good thing we brought
the German sports car.

14:25.436 --> 14:28.003
Says the man in the $5,000 suit.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.172
Nine... if we're counting.

14:30.174 --> 14:32.674
I'm not a barbarian.

14:32.676 --> 14:35.510
All right, look, your
expert better pay off.

14:35.512 --> 14:37.475
Otherwise, we're wasting
time that we don't have.

14:37.478 --> 14:39.581
See, that's so very hurtful,
Marcellus, and here I thought

14:39.583 --> 14:41.684
we were having a marvelous
galactic adventure together.

14:41.686 --> 14:43.418
You think you're real cute, don't you?

14:43.420 --> 14:45.654
Yeah, the only reason
that you invited me on

14:45.656 --> 14:48.559
on this little road trip is
so you could play bodyguard.

14:48.562 --> 14:50.462
- Baby-sitter.
- Keep my power

14:50.465 --> 14:53.895
from falling into the
hands of the Hollow, right?

14:53.897 --> 14:55.697
Now, see, you're always
working some angle

14:55.700 --> 14:56.898
to protect your family.

14:56.900 --> 15:00.101
At least Klaus is up front
about it, but not you with

15:00.103 --> 15:02.103
your manners and your suits
and your handkerchiefs.

15:02.105 --> 15:04.139
What do you want me to do?

15:08.278 --> 15:10.779
We're under threat.

15:10.781 --> 15:13.114
I know that, and I know
how you handle threats.

15:13.116 --> 15:14.460
You made that clear

15:14.463 --> 15:16.324
when you tore my heart
out five years ago.

15:16.327 --> 15:17.886
And just so we're clear now,

15:17.888 --> 15:21.056
there's no way I will
ever forgive you for that.

15:21.058 --> 15:23.592
I don't expect you to.

15:27.032 --> 15:29.433
I certainly never forgave myself.

16:05.469 --> 16:07.869
Car trouble?

16:07.871 --> 16:10.590
Yeah, it's the damndest thing.

16:10.593 --> 16:12.541
Just died on me.

16:12.543 --> 16:14.442
Unless you want to follow suit...

16:15.245 --> 16:16.411
give me the bone.

16:16.413 --> 16:18.509
Yeah. Sorry.

16:18.512 --> 16:20.348
Some other guy called dibs.

16:20.350 --> 16:22.817
And he's a real jerk.

16:33.797 --> 16:35.063
Why are you laughing?

16:35.065 --> 16:37.299
'Cause I know something that you don't.

16:38.735 --> 16:39.819
And what's that?

16:39.822 --> 16:41.722
I packed that trunk full of C-4.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.944
If this thing is so powerful
it can't be destroyed,

16:48.946 --> 16:51.112
why bring us here? Why
tell us all of this?

16:51.114 --> 16:53.248
The Ancestors needed you to know.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.050
Please inform the Ancestors

16:55.052 --> 16:57.052
that they're a colossal
waste of my time.

16:57.054 --> 16:58.620
I've been alive a thousand years.

16:58.622 --> 17:00.388
I've never met anything I couldn't kill.

17:00.390 --> 17:03.024
We will defeat this
pathetic phantom, as well.

17:03.026 --> 17:04.326
It was her tribe

17:04.328 --> 17:05.694
that turned her into this thing.

17:05.695 --> 17:07.194
Her family should have stopped it.

17:07.196 --> 17:08.630
You don't think they tried?

17:08.632 --> 17:10.999
All they wanted was to
undue what their magic did.

17:12.536 --> 17:14.536
But that was the beginning of the end.

17:14.538 --> 17:17.806
Over time, she grew
and craved more power.

17:17.808 --> 17:20.039
Inadu channeled life in all its forms.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.444
Her hunger was insatiable.

17:22.445 --> 17:25.547
She loved the fear
she inspired in others.

17:25.549 --> 17:29.818
Her people knew her
as ruthless, unfeeling, empty.

17:29.820 --> 17:33.088
Until that became her defining quality.

17:33.090 --> 17:36.458
So they began to refer to
her by that single trait...

17:36.460 --> 17:39.694
The Hollow.

17:39.696 --> 17:41.262
She killed them all.

17:41.264 --> 17:45.500
Not because they hurt
her or were unkind.

17:45.502 --> 17:47.235
She did it for fun.

17:47.237 --> 17:48.903
Well,

17:48.905 --> 17:50.905
to be fair, we all have our bad days.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.241
- You think this is a joke,
- No, but it is

17:53.243 --> 17:54.943
a trifle tedious. Perhaps you could get

17:54.945 --> 17:57.612
to the bit of the story
that might be of some use.

17:57.614 --> 17:59.781
You want to defeat the Hollow?

17:59.783 --> 18:01.950
She only has one weakness.

18:01.952 --> 18:04.019
You have my undivided attention.

18:04.021 --> 18:05.887
What is it?

18:08.158 --> 18:11.026
You.

18:11.028 --> 18:12.894
You're the one chance we have.

18:13.997 --> 18:15.497
What the hell does that mean?

18:15.499 --> 18:17.999
I'm done talking to you.

18:20.611 --> 18:22.311
Davina?

18:22.314 --> 18:24.947
Davina?!

18:42.775 --> 18:44.741
Oh, thanks for coming.

18:44.744 --> 18:46.798
Would have been a long
walk back to Mystic Falls.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.167
Don't tell me this is your expert.

18:50.437 --> 18:51.836
So what happened?

18:51.838 --> 18:54.172
Well, aside for forfeiting
my lease, I blew up

18:54.174 --> 18:55.607
one of those vampire-witch combos

18:55.609 --> 18:57.008
when she tried to take the bone.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.595
What did she look like?

18:58.598 --> 19:00.578
Oh. Brunette,

19:00.580 --> 19:03.014
gorgeous, lace top.

19:03.016 --> 19:05.750
Black jacket, glowing blue eyes.

19:06.820 --> 19:08.553
Sofya.

19:08.555 --> 19:11.155
The Hollow's inside
Sofya, probably using her.

19:11.157 --> 19:12.264
Or using all of us.

19:12.267 --> 19:13.992
Oh, we got to find a way to save her.

19:13.994 --> 19:15.293
Or put her out of her misery.

19:15.295 --> 19:17.662
I'm sorry. What? Did I hear that right?

19:17.664 --> 19:19.998
Oh, that's right. That is
the Mikaelson way, isn't it?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.333
I mean, why try to save someone
when you can just kill 'em?

19:22.335 --> 19:25.203
Hey, I love a good grudge
just as much as the next guy,

19:25.205 --> 19:26.804
but do you want to stand
around whining about a missing

19:26.806 --> 19:28.541
finger bone, or do you
want to talk about a ledger

19:28.543 --> 19:30.720
that points us to where
the other bones might be?

19:30.723 --> 19:34.045
I studied the records, and I
got a family name... Del Robles.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.783
Bloodline ends ten
years ago, and according

19:35.786 --> 19:37.118
to the Lockwood records,

19:37.121 --> 19:38.587
somebody in that family is buried

19:38.590 --> 19:40.584
with one of those mystical bones.

19:40.587 --> 19:42.554
Where?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.556
Black Clay Cemetery in the Treme.

19:44.558 --> 19:47.070
- Well, Sofya has a head start.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:47.073 --> 19:49.370
That cemetery was
redeployed. Too much flooding.

19:49.373 --> 19:51.806
Now the bodies were moved
to two separate locales...

19:51.809 --> 19:53.309
The Haves and the Have Nots.

19:53.312 --> 19:54.699
Del Robles were aristocracy.

19:54.701 --> 19:57.035
Okay, it means their crypt was
moved to St. Ailbhe Cemetery.

19:57.037 --> 19:58.373
Yeah, that sounds like
fun, but on the way,

19:58.375 --> 20:01.239
can you drop me off at the ER? Thanks.

20:02.542 --> 20:05.143
What the hell is all this?

20:05.145 --> 20:06.674
This is what's needed if we want

20:06.677 --> 20:08.346
- to stop the Hollow.
- What's needed

20:08.348 --> 20:10.582
- is Klaus.
- No, Hayley, we only need you.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.183
What are you talking about?

20:12.185 --> 20:15.253
It all comes down to the bloodline.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.589
That's the only thing
that worked against her.

20:19.559 --> 20:22.827
When her evil became too great to bear,

20:22.829 --> 20:26.397
the tribes united to defeat her.

20:41.047 --> 20:44.616
Tribe elders managed to capture
her using mystical bindings.

20:46.519 --> 20:50.634
But even with all that
power, Inadu was too strong.

20:50.637 --> 20:53.157
Death seemed the only solution.

20:54.861 --> 20:57.695
Four of the strongest elders

20:57.697 --> 21:01.040
each imbued a part of their magic

21:01.043 --> 21:04.002
into a mighty ax.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.105
When the weapon was ready...

21:08.742 --> 21:11.491
they relied on her mother,

21:11.494 --> 21:13.761
the one who gave her life,

21:13.764 --> 21:16.832
to be the one to take her life.

21:19.552 --> 21:22.754
But before she could kill her child,

21:22.756 --> 21:24.789
Inadu cast a final spell.

21:24.791 --> 21:28.026
Hashi nvgidgia nvsadi.

21:28.028 --> 21:30.895
One powered by her own death.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.334
A curse upon all present that night.

21:38.071 --> 21:40.071
She bound them to the full moon,

21:40.073 --> 21:42.840
so that once a month they
would turn into the very beasts

21:42.842 --> 21:44.709
they used to hunt her.

21:55.455 --> 21:59.090
The Hollow created the werewolf curse.

22:00.460 --> 22:02.694
You bear the mark of the Crescent.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.663
So did she.

22:05.665 --> 22:07.098
And her mother... Who, once cursed,

22:07.100 --> 22:09.100
became the first of the werewolves.

22:09.102 --> 22:11.202
The others fled,

22:11.204 --> 22:13.438
becoming the six other
wolves you know today.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.840
But it was your line that began it all,

22:15.842 --> 22:18.643
and yours alone that still
has power over the Hollow.

22:18.645 --> 22:21.713
That's why she's been hunting Labonairs.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.015
The Hollow fears you.

22:24.017 --> 22:25.516
She wants you dead.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.251
And if you die,

22:27.253 --> 22:29.153
there's only one Labonair left.

22:29.155 --> 22:30.655
Hope.

22:30.657 --> 22:32.736
You can protect your daughter, Hayley.

22:32.739 --> 22:35.039
But I need you to trust me.

22:47.107 --> 22:49.207
Here's the "Del Robles" crypt.

22:54.547 --> 22:56.013
Looks like, given the body count,

22:56.015 --> 22:58.483
we're gonna have to
check thousands of bones.

23:01.354 --> 23:04.756
"Our hearts will always
defend this land."

23:04.758 --> 23:06.557
I think it's some kind of clue.

23:06.559 --> 23:07.792
Let's get to work.

23:10.987 --> 23:12.730
The Ancestors can't find the Hollow,

23:12.732 --> 23:14.565
which means she's chosen a host.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.268
Now, if you can track
her, you can fight her.

23:18.138 --> 23:20.238
Your blood is her weakness, so use it.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.440
Once your spirit's free, I can use Klaus

23:22.442 --> 23:24.509
to cast a spell to
imprison her for good.

23:29.716 --> 23:32.617
Remember, Hayley, this won't
work if you don't trust me.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.498
You know what to do.

24:08.555 --> 24:11.823
Marcel.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.992
Olivia Tierra Del Robles.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.796
Tierra, of course, means land.

24:18.798 --> 24:21.332
As in all the hearts will defend it.

24:21.334 --> 24:22.800
Mmm.

24:22.802 --> 24:24.836
Watch yourself.

24:30.343 --> 24:34.045
And there's our bone.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.985
Now give it to me.

24:40.987 --> 24:42.386
Yeah. I don't think so.

24:42.388 --> 24:43.855
I'm not gonna ask you again.

24:43.857 --> 24:45.456
You have one of the bones already.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.693
The smart play would
be to keep them divided,

24:48.695 --> 24:50.158
yet still in the hands

24:50.161 --> 24:52.296
of an ally you trust.

24:52.298 --> 24:54.899
So I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me,

24:54.901 --> 24:56.200
Elijah.

25:00.807 --> 25:03.574
I don't have to trust anyone.

25:03.576 --> 25:05.409
Careful, Elijah.

25:05.411 --> 25:07.778
Your true colors are starting to show.

25:08.815 --> 25:10.414
Yeah. You may talk a big game,

25:10.416 --> 25:12.016
but when it comes down to it,

25:12.018 --> 25:15.386
you'll always be a poster
boy for violence first.

25:15.388 --> 25:17.788
Always and forever.

25:35.770 --> 25:38.304
You men and your silly posturing.

25:38.307 --> 25:41.479
You should know better.

25:41.481 --> 25:44.760
After all, your prize
already belongs to me.

25:53.381 --> 25:56.817
Sofya, I know you're still in there.

25:56.819 --> 25:58.618
She is.

25:58.620 --> 26:01.688
Strong soul rattling
around in a dying shell.

26:01.690 --> 26:05.225
But like all the rest of you,
she's nothing compared to me.

26:05.227 --> 26:06.827
One last time.

26:06.829 --> 26:08.395
Give me what I seek.

26:08.397 --> 26:10.764
- Why don't you come get it?
- Fair enough.

26:10.766 --> 26:13.667
So long as you're prepared to die.

26:18.540 --> 26:22.109
Now the game comes to an end.

26:22.111 --> 26:23.743
Not just yet.

26:26.515 --> 26:28.415
What have you done with Hayley?

26:28.417 --> 26:30.050
I sent her to save us all.

26:30.052 --> 26:31.685
Really?

26:31.687 --> 26:33.553
Or is this your idea of revenge?

26:33.555 --> 26:35.021
Holding me captive here?

26:35.023 --> 26:36.857
I don't care about revenge.

26:36.859 --> 26:40.026
I'm a New Orleans witch
and I will protect my home.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.463
Not just for me, but
for your daughter, too.

26:43.465 --> 26:45.031
- Then release me.
- No.

26:45.033 --> 26:46.333
I need you here.

26:46.335 --> 26:48.168
You see, we have the same problem

26:48.170 --> 26:49.636
that the tribes did.

26:49.638 --> 26:51.104
After the tribe killed Inadu,

26:51.106 --> 26:52.906
her spirit became more powerful.

26:52.908 --> 26:54.708
She haunted them.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.076
The blue lights.

26:56.078 --> 26:57.978
Yes.

26:57.980 --> 27:00.447
So they burned her remains,

27:00.449 --> 27:02.682
but not all the pieces
could be destroyed.

27:02.684 --> 27:04.251
As long as those pieces were together,

27:04.253 --> 27:05.452
her power only grew.

27:05.454 --> 27:09.322
The indestructible bones

27:09.324 --> 27:12.259
were distributed among four families...

27:18.130 --> 27:21.301
each charged with
keeping the bones apart,

27:21.303 --> 27:26.139
so that they would never
come together again.

27:32.481 --> 27:34.080
Now that she's free, she won't stop

27:34.082 --> 27:35.649
until those pieces are gathered.

27:35.651 --> 27:37.617
Well, then put her back in the prison

27:37.619 --> 27:39.319
that held her for the last eon.

27:39.321 --> 27:41.254
I will.

27:43.392 --> 27:45.625
And that's what you're here for.

27:56.438 --> 27:58.471
Hurts, huh?

27:58.473 --> 27:59.773
My blood?

28:04.580 --> 28:06.446
Whoever told you how to destroy me

28:06.448 --> 28:08.648
left a little something out.

28:08.650 --> 28:11.785
Trapping me requires
the release of power.

28:11.788 --> 28:13.720
The kind you get when

28:13.722 --> 28:16.156
you sacrifice the life of an immortal.

28:16.158 --> 28:18.258
So you channel my power...

28:18.260 --> 28:20.994
and you imprison the Hollow.

28:20.996 --> 28:24.898
And how long, exactly,
am I to play battery?

28:24.900 --> 28:28.568
You still don't get it, do you, Klaus?

28:28.570 --> 28:30.904
You're not a battery.

28:30.906 --> 28:32.305
You're a sacrifice.

28:32.307 --> 28:34.274
Tell me,

28:34.276 --> 28:36.176
which of you will die

28:36.178 --> 28:38.445
to stop me?

28:40.849 --> 28:42.616
No one is dying today.

28:42.618 --> 28:45.952
Well, then I guess we're done.

28:56.164 --> 28:59.132
You okay?

29:00.068 --> 29:02.569
I think someone is going to die.

29:03.505 --> 29:05.438
Davina has Klaus.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.374
Wait... Davina?

29:07.376 --> 29:09.909
The Ancestors need

29:09.911 --> 29:12.012
a sacrifice to put the
Hollow down for good.

29:12.014 --> 29:13.713
Davina will not hesitate.

29:13.715 --> 29:15.081
Well, I must say,

29:15.083 --> 29:16.650
it's adorable you think you're able

29:16.652 --> 29:19.452
to end my life, but you
lack the means, sweetheart.

29:19.454 --> 29:22.489
The Hollow created the means.

29:22.491 --> 29:26.226
Thorns from a rosebush
grown from Marcel's blood.

29:26.228 --> 29:29.562
That's all I need.

29:29.564 --> 29:32.365
And I've already sent the
Harvest Girls to go get some.

29:33.902 --> 29:35.435
When they return,

29:35.437 --> 29:37.337
your time is up.

29:42.346 --> 29:45.231
So to cage the Hollow,
you need to kill me?

29:45.233 --> 29:46.899
It's a bit convenient, isn't it?

29:46.901 --> 29:48.668
I helped break the
link to the Ancestors,

29:48.670 --> 29:50.136
which is how the Hollow escaped.

29:50.138 --> 29:51.838
If you have to blame someone,

29:51.840 --> 29:53.105
blame me, I don't care.

29:53.107 --> 29:56.209
You're going to die
a slow, painful death.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.444
I'm sorry,

29:58.446 --> 30:01.347
but the best I can do is make
it a little easier for you.

30:02.784 --> 30:03.983
Davina...

30:12.727 --> 30:14.494
Davina, don't.

30:24.138 --> 30:26.339
You should wait here.

30:26.341 --> 30:28.374
She still blames the
Mikaelsons for what happened.

30:28.376 --> 30:30.409
You'll just make it worse.

30:38.915 --> 30:40.470
Davina.

30:46.828 --> 30:49.128
Don't try to stop me, Marcel.

30:50.732 --> 30:53.232
If I don't kill Klaus, if
I don't put down the Hollow,

30:53.234 --> 30:54.600
she'll come for all of you.

30:54.602 --> 30:56.335
She'll burn the entire city.

30:56.337 --> 30:57.670
Davina, please.

30:57.672 --> 30:59.705
D. There's got to be another way.

30:59.707 --> 31:00.840
No.

31:00.842 --> 31:02.575
I was just waiting for the weapon,

31:02.577 --> 31:04.110
but now that you're here...

31:05.145 --> 31:07.512
I'm sorry.

31:07.515 --> 31:10.730
- But you need to kill him.
- No, Davina.

31:10.733 --> 31:12.884
He's lived ten lifetimes,
that's more than enough.

31:12.887 --> 31:14.747
No. He's Hope's father.

31:14.750 --> 31:15.916
She'll still have you.

31:15.919 --> 31:17.557
But if we don't stop the Hollow,

31:17.559 --> 31:19.058
then Hope will die.

31:20.361 --> 31:23.162
You can save her, Marcel.

31:23.164 --> 31:27.066
- And everyone in New Orleans.
- Stop this.

31:27.068 --> 31:29.346
This is about your grievances with me.

31:29.349 --> 31:30.970
This has nothing to do with you.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.405
This is about a sacrifice.

31:32.407 --> 31:33.806
One death for the greater good.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.675
Then take me.

31:35.677 --> 31:37.176
- Elijah, no.
- No.

31:38.212 --> 31:40.479
If indeed there is no other way...

31:42.417 --> 31:43.482
then end this now.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.550
No. No.

31:44.552 --> 31:46.452
No, nobody's dying today.

31:46.454 --> 31:47.587
Then I'll do it myself.

31:47.589 --> 31:49.589
No! Davina!

31:50.825 --> 31:51.591
Davina!

32:09.344 --> 32:11.978
- Davina, please...
- You don't have to do this.

32:11.980 --> 32:13.846
I'm sorry, it's the only way.

32:20.021 --> 32:22.455
No!

32:24.292 --> 32:27.226
You promised to help,
but you're not helping.

32:27.228 --> 32:28.794
You're hurting us,

32:28.796 --> 32:30.510
and I won't let you.

33:15.020 --> 33:17.287
My dad said you study this stuff.

33:17.289 --> 33:19.856
Yeah, that's right.

33:19.858 --> 33:23.593
There are a lot of amazing
things in the world to study.

33:23.595 --> 33:27.497
And some of them are even things
that don't want to hurt you.

33:28.162 --> 33:29.662
And what do you have there?

33:30.157 --> 33:32.624
These are for serenity.

33:34.243 --> 33:37.745
And this one is for stillness.

33:37.747 --> 33:40.448
They'll keep the flowers in bloom.

33:41.617 --> 33:43.984
Now, did you teach yourself all that?

33:43.986 --> 33:47.555
Well, I did read about it in
one of my Aunt Freya's books.

33:47.557 --> 33:50.057
She's helping me learn,

33:50.059 --> 33:52.893
but some stuff I figured out on my own.

33:52.895 --> 33:54.662
Mm.

33:55.698 --> 33:59.433
Well... that is all very impressive.

34:01.370 --> 34:03.737
She's an impressive young lady.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.776
It's good meeting you,

34:07.778 --> 34:10.012
littlest Mikaelson.

34:10.014 --> 34:12.313
I'll be seeing you around.

34:15.853 --> 34:17.453
Those for me?

34:18.289 --> 34:20.155
After what you did today,

34:20.157 --> 34:24.025
your dad compelled the
entire Magnolia candy shop.

34:25.463 --> 34:27.663
Dad seemed sad.

34:27.665 --> 34:31.967
I think that he wanted to be
the one doing the helping today.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.335
But we both agreed on one thing:

34:34.338 --> 34:36.304
you were very, very brave.

34:36.306 --> 34:38.407
I just thought about what you would do.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.810
It's like you always say:
if we stick together,

34:41.812 --> 34:43.379
nothing can hurt us.

34:43.380 --> 34:45.347
Always and forever.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.367
I suppose I owe you thanks.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.403
Well, staying the hell out of Virginia

35:07.405 --> 35:09.104
is all the thanks I need.

35:09.106 --> 35:11.040
Well, then perhaps we should forgo

35:11.042 --> 35:12.941
a trip down memory lane.

35:12.943 --> 35:16.712
Look, from one father to another,

35:16.714 --> 35:18.747
you're not gonna be able

35:18.749 --> 35:21.450
to keep Hope locked up much longer.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.786
And I'm guessing you know that

35:23.788 --> 35:25.921
Caroline and I have built a school.

35:25.923 --> 35:27.723
It's a place for kids

35:27.725 --> 35:31.026
with supernatural
leanings, just like Hope.

35:33.330 --> 35:36.031
Our two girls are thriving there.

35:36.033 --> 35:39.735
They are learning to use
their powers for good...

35:39.737 --> 35:43.205
and to embrace their
identities without fear.

35:46.143 --> 35:49.044
Hope would always be welcome there.

35:57.421 --> 36:00.255
Give my regards to Mystic Falls.

36:33.991 --> 36:36.258
What were you thinking?

36:38.262 --> 36:40.028
You can't promise me a future

36:40.030 --> 36:42.131
and then offer yourself up to die.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.266
Survival demands sacrifice.

36:44.268 --> 36:45.990
There is always another way, Elijah.

36:45.993 --> 36:47.703
There wasn't time for another way.

36:47.705 --> 36:49.004
Well, Hope just got her family

36:49.006 --> 36:50.072
and she needs you.

36:50.074 --> 36:52.307
Hope needs her father.

36:52.309 --> 36:54.643
I need you.

36:56.981 --> 36:59.948
I love you.

36:59.950 --> 37:03.018
But we've got to figure
out a way to fight and win

37:03.020 --> 37:06.522
and still have something that
I recognize as a good life.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.261
Rebekah asked me

37:12.263 --> 37:15.197
if there was somewhere
I could go to be happy.

37:16.033 --> 37:19.168
Begin again.

37:21.105 --> 37:23.539
Manosque.

37:25.309 --> 37:26.808
It's this...

37:26.810 --> 37:30.145
beautiful village in the
south of France, the...

37:30.147 --> 37:32.581
countryside.

37:35.419 --> 37:39.087
And when we end this...

37:41.125 --> 37:43.592
and we will end this...

37:43.594 --> 37:45.827
I'll take you there.

37:45.829 --> 37:47.663
And...

37:47.665 --> 37:49.865
promise you...

37:49.867 --> 37:52.167
I will make this right.

38:08.686 --> 38:11.520
Then start by giving this to Marcel.

38:38.582 --> 38:41.483
D, I'm sorry.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.319
When I lost you, my world fell apart,

38:44.321 --> 38:46.488
and I went through all the stages.

38:46.490 --> 38:50.659
I went through my whole rage spiral.

38:50.661 --> 38:53.595
I took it out on Klaus, Elijah,

38:53.597 --> 38:58.233
and they deserved what they got.

38:58.258 --> 39:00.158
But, um...

39:01.272 --> 39:03.205
now that it's all said and done,

39:03.207 --> 39:06.975
and... and you're still gone,

39:06.977 --> 39:09.478
the, uh...

39:09.480 --> 39:11.947
the only thing that keeps me in check

39:11.949 --> 39:13.949
is a code that I had...

39:13.951 --> 39:15.984
when I was a kid.

39:15.986 --> 39:18.587
Growing up, I saw firsthand
what happens without one.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.594
You might think that I let you down.

39:25.596 --> 39:28.463
But I know that there is another way.

39:28.465 --> 39:30.432
I believe that.

39:30.434 --> 39:32.334
Even now.

39:43.080 --> 39:45.280
I just hope you still believe in me.

40:28.392 --> 40:31.827
Are you ready to die, Elijah?

40:37.636 --> 40:40.502
Because I'm quite ready to live.
