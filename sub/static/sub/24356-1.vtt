01:34.943 --> 01:36.012
Hey, you know what?

01:36.945 --> 01:38.314
Do you mind putting this on?

01:40.115 --> 01:40.984
Why?

01:45.853 --> 01:47.154
It's not that bad.

01:47.156 --> 01:49.423
It's not. It's like...
It's like a handful of people.

01:49.425 --> 01:52.059
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Mm-mm.

01:52.061 --> 01:54.731
Chris, I think you're just gonna have
to suck it up and receive the love.

01:59.934 --> 02:01.268
Mm-mm.

02:01.270 --> 02:02.902
I'll shut it down
after an hour, okay?

02:02.904 --> 02:04.036
An hour?

02:04.038 --> 02:06.409
Dude, people have been waiting
20 years for this.

02:08.109 --> 02:09.443
You don't think I know that?

02:10.445 --> 02:11.913
- I'm aware of that.
- I know.

02:12.613 --> 02:13.482
I know.

02:15.117 --> 02:15.985
All right.

02:26.361 --> 02:28.597
Surprise!

02:29.865 --> 02:30.867
Hey, guys.

02:32.835 --> 02:33.836
Oh, my God.

02:34.702 --> 02:36.335
What're you guys doin' here?

02:38.073 --> 02:40.006
I just went to get burgers.

02:40.008 --> 02:41.274
What's the big deal?

02:41.276 --> 02:43.377
- How you doing?
- Hey. Good to see you.

02:43.379 --> 02:44.845
- Doing good?
- Great.

02:44.847 --> 02:47.214
- This is my wife, Carol.
- Nice to meet you.

02:47.216 --> 02:49.181
These are my boys,
Jimmy and Eric.

02:49.183 --> 02:51.450
- Oh, honey.
- Oh, my God.

02:51.452 --> 02:52.953
- Oh, God.
- Welcome home.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.988
You know, your mom really
wanted to be here,

02:54.990 --> 02:57.524
but you know, she's afraid
to fly and everything

02:57.526 --> 03:00.092
and Cliff could never make
the drive up from Phoenix.

03:00.094 --> 03:01.193
What do you think
about a speech?

03:01.195 --> 03:02.228
What do you think
about a speech, huh?

03:02.230 --> 03:03.764
Right, speech.
Let's do it.

03:03.766 --> 03:05.298
Can I get a 7-Up
or something?

03:05.300 --> 03:07.266
Nobody drinks 7-Up anymore.
What about a beer?

03:07.268 --> 03:08.869
God, excuse me.

03:08.871 --> 03:10.603
You don't have to
apologize anymore.

03:10.605 --> 03:13.038
You are a free man in America.
Look at this.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.141
His first beer in 20 years.

03:16.378 --> 03:18.478
And that rhymed.
And that rhymed.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.013
If you want to keep clapping
for that.

03:21.182 --> 03:23.085
All right. Here we go.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.286
This is weird.

03:26.288 --> 03:27.888
Um...

03:27.890 --> 03:30.490
It's very strange and I feel
like I'm dreaming or something.

03:30.492 --> 03:32.992
I don't even recognize
half of you people.

03:34.563 --> 03:38.398
Um, I do wanna say thanks
for being here

03:38.400 --> 03:40.135
and for not
forgetting about me.

03:41.336 --> 03:43.470
And then also...

03:43.472 --> 03:45.775
you know, for the people
who helped get me out.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.579
I don't really know
what I can say...

03:50.879 --> 03:54.514
I will say that I would like
to take a piss

03:54.516 --> 03:56.515
in a private bathroom,

03:56.517 --> 03:58.384
for the first time
in a really long time.

03:58.386 --> 03:59.686
So can I do that now?

03:59.688 --> 04:01.353
- Yes, you can.
- All right.

04:01.355 --> 04:04.291
Chris is gonna take a piss in private
for the first time in 20 years.

04:06.295 --> 04:08.794
Okay.
Oh, hey, everybody.

04:08.796 --> 04:11.230
Chris' high school teacher,
Mrs. Beasley, is here.

04:13.502 --> 04:16.902
You know, if it wasn't for you,
Chris would still be in jail.

04:16.904 --> 04:18.838
Pooping in public,
Mrs. Beasley.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.541
You saved him from pooping
in public.

04:21.274 --> 04:22.711
What they did to him...

04:23.544 --> 04:25.212
it wasn't right.

04:25.214 --> 04:26.549
That wasn't justice.

04:27.382 --> 04:29.248
He didn't deserve that.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.522
And he didn't deserve the 20
years he's already served.

04:33.387 --> 04:35.054
We don't know how
you did it,

04:35.056 --> 04:37.523
but we can never ever
thank you enough.

04:37.525 --> 04:39.124
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:46.534 --> 04:47.967
Yeah. Well, it was
a long time ago.

04:47.969 --> 04:50.070
The house isn't
even there anymore.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.507
Yeah. Where are you guys?

04:53.375 --> 04:54.644
- Hi...
- Hi.

04:55.376 --> 04:56.775
Hi.

04:56.777 --> 04:58.210
Hey. Hi...

04:58.212 --> 04:59.679
- Hi, Chris.
- Hey.

04:59.681 --> 05:02.047
We used to live next door
to you up on Hill Crest.

05:02.049 --> 05:04.251
Right. Hi, Mr. Phil.
Thanks for coming.

05:04.253 --> 05:06.018
Thanks...
Thanks for being here.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.821
Oh, of course.
I'm sorry Tom couldn't make it,

05:07.823 --> 05:10.155
but I wanted you to meet Hildy,
and then, she disappeared.

05:10.157 --> 05:12.527
I don't know. But I'll make sure
she says hi before we leave.

05:14.195 --> 05:17.063
You know, everyone
here is just so happy for you.

05:17.065 --> 05:18.732
How does it feel
to be free?

05:18.734 --> 05:20.467
- Great.
- Well, now you get out there.

05:20.469 --> 05:21.700
Pursue those dreams.

05:21.702 --> 05:23.302
You think you might
try college?

05:23.304 --> 05:24.905
I don't know.
Um, maybe.

05:24.907 --> 05:26.773
I don't know whether it's
possible right now,

05:26.775 --> 05:29.475
but just, you know,
glad to be... here.

05:29.477 --> 05:30.910
What do you think
you'll study?

05:30.912 --> 05:33.580
Um... Maybe criminal justice
or something. I don't know.

05:33.582 --> 05:34.914
That's great. Yeah.

05:34.916 --> 05:37.450
You still have plenty of
good years in front of you.

05:37.452 --> 05:38.717
Thanks.

05:38.719 --> 05:40.522
You can do anything
you put your mind to.

05:41.823 --> 05:43.558
Okay.
Excuse me one second.

05:52.500 --> 05:53.799
Just a minute.

05:53.801 --> 05:55.904
Please, let me in.

05:59.974 --> 06:01.073
Sorry.

06:04.912 --> 06:06.378
I'm sorry.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.049
Sorry.
Are you Hildy?

06:08.950 --> 06:10.316
Yeah.

06:10.318 --> 06:12.184
I'm Chris.
I'm so sorry about this.

06:17.258 --> 06:19.359
Oh.

06:19.361 --> 06:21.595
It smells like
cotton candy and acid.

06:21.597 --> 06:23.462
- Dude, close the door.
- You close the door.

06:23.464 --> 06:25.765
Dude, I'm fucking sick, man.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.499
What's wrong with you?
Are you retarded?

06:28.971 --> 06:29.839
Okay.

08:01.029 --> 08:01.998
Hi.

08:06.101 --> 08:07.637
Holy moly.

08:09.570 --> 08:10.736
You're real.

08:10.738 --> 08:12.041
Yeah.

08:17.378 --> 08:18.713
Oh, my God.

08:20.515 --> 08:21.984
Holy mackerel.

08:26.188 --> 08:28.487
You know, she's convinced
that my life is perfect,

08:28.489 --> 08:30.823
and hers isn't,
and that, you know,

08:30.825 --> 08:33.659
she has to work much harder
for all the same stuff.

08:33.660 --> 08:34.994
You know, it's the same story.

08:34.996 --> 08:36.763
And it happened
when we were kids.

08:36.765 --> 08:39.932
You know, she was convinced
that my father gave us...

08:39.933 --> 08:41.801
gave me more attention
than her,

08:41.803 --> 08:43.268
and I was treated differently.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.638
Anyway, she doesn't wanna hear
anything other than that, so...

08:45.640 --> 08:47.606
I don't... I'm not even
gonna try anymore.

08:47.608 --> 08:49.175
It's just not worth it.

08:49.177 --> 08:51.643
I don't know why you would. It
goes bad every time you try.

08:51.645 --> 08:52.747
Yeah.

08:53.948 --> 08:55.849
Look at you,
sitting in my car.

08:55.851 --> 08:58.187
I can't... I can't get over this.

08:59.553 --> 09:02.154
Yeah.

09:02.156 --> 09:05.124
I keep thinking that they're gonna
come and get me and put me back in.

09:05.126 --> 09:07.262
Like, say they made a mistake
or something.

09:07.661 --> 09:08.763
I bet.

09:10.698 --> 09:12.133
But this feels good.

09:12.534 --> 09:13.736
Out here.

09:20.775 --> 09:23.042
So where is the,
um, present...

09:23.044 --> 09:24.713
- you were talking about?
- Oh, shit.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.412
Oh, I forgot.

09:26.414 --> 09:28.882
So, this is the first time
I've ever done this.

09:28.884 --> 09:30.452
But I'm pretty
proud of it.

09:35.222 --> 09:36.391
Wow, that is...

09:37.159 --> 09:38.727
so...

09:40.161 --> 09:42.228
It's the worst thing
you've ever seen.

09:42.230 --> 09:43.662
No, wait. It has...

09:43.664 --> 09:44.763
its own charm.

09:44.765 --> 09:46.699
I mean, this could
only be me.

09:46.701 --> 09:47.633
Right?

09:51.039 --> 09:51.973
Seriously.

09:53.207 --> 09:54.574
Please, keep it.

09:54.576 --> 09:56.508
- I can keep this?
- Please keep it.

09:56.510 --> 09:57.976
- Thank you.
- I don't need it.

09:57.978 --> 10:01.413
I mean, I realize I don't
need a picture of you anymore.

10:01.415 --> 10:04.119
I mean, that's the best part.
I get to, like...

10:04.986 --> 10:07.887
see your face in real life,
you know.

10:07.889 --> 10:09.390
Like, whenever we want.

10:25.539 --> 10:27.873
Oh... You know what?

10:27.875 --> 10:31.210
I... think I have to go.

10:31.212 --> 10:33.812
It's actually late... Wow, it's
actually much later than I thought.

10:33.814 --> 10:35.748
I'm not out
this late usually.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.950
Tom's probably waiting
up for me.

10:36.952 --> 10:38.618
- Yeah.
- And I have to work tomorrow.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.552
- So, I gotta take off.
- Okay.

10:40.554 --> 10:43.122
Um, when can we
hang out next?

10:43.124 --> 10:46.392
Oh... I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

10:46.394 --> 10:47.962
All right.

11:05.145 --> 11:06.048
So...

12:27.395 --> 12:30.296
So she lights that shit,
taps him on the shoulder,

12:30.298 --> 12:32.965
She hands it to him right
before it's about to go off.

12:32.967 --> 12:34.133
Oh, my God.

12:34.135 --> 12:35.534
You should have seen
the look on his face.

12:35.536 --> 12:38.370
It's like he just got
a live hand grenade.

12:38.372 --> 12:40.974
Oh, my God,
I was laughing so hard,

12:40.976 --> 12:41.974
I almost puked.

12:54.555 --> 12:55.421
Look at you.

12:55.423 --> 12:57.824
You're looking
a little wind-blown.

12:57.826 --> 12:59.094
What are you talking about?

13:00.395 --> 13:02.829
What was that
devious little smile?

13:02.831 --> 13:04.897
What devious little smile?
I just...

13:04.899 --> 13:06.832
You know, I had a nice
weekend is all.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.267
Something is happening
with you,

13:08.269 --> 13:11.073
and I don't know what it is,
and I need to know, Carol.

13:12.106 --> 13:14.208
Joanie,
English Department only.

13:17.746 --> 13:18.981
What already?

13:19.880 --> 13:22.215
It's just, um...

13:22.217 --> 13:25.051
I think Chris has like
a little crush on me.

13:25.053 --> 13:27.552
Oh, my God,
that's hot!

13:28.990 --> 13:31.990
No, but, wait. I'm worried that
it's gonna affect his re-entry.

13:31.992 --> 13:33.792
- You know...
- No pun intended.

13:33.794 --> 13:35.164
Ha ha ha.

13:38.699 --> 13:39.634
Anyway...

13:40.367 --> 13:41.236
So?

13:42.669 --> 13:43.869
What?

13:43.871 --> 13:45.207
How do you feel
about him?

13:46.607 --> 13:48.907
I... You know, it's Chris.

13:48.909 --> 13:52.744
You know, he's great, but he was
my student, so I can't um...

13:52.746 --> 13:57.182
I mean, of course I'm fond of him.
I mean, 20 years...

13:57.184 --> 13:59.287
You can't help but get
close, you know? But...

14:00.121 --> 14:01.723
I don't know. It's...

14:03.158 --> 14:04.393
Anyway, I'm married.

14:07.127 --> 14:10.229
Maybe Chris could be a little
wake up call for Tom.

14:10.231 --> 14:12.467
Hmm? Pull his head out
of the sand?

14:12.900 --> 14:14.099
Yeah.

14:14.101 --> 14:15.734
I tell you,
that's what I need.

14:15.736 --> 14:18.339
I need a little 38-year-old ex-con
walking around my living room.

14:19.774 --> 14:21.541
Chris is looking for work.

14:21.543 --> 14:23.008
Carol!

14:23.010 --> 14:24.710
- Oh, gosh! But...
- That's funny.

14:24.712 --> 14:26.946
Awful thing to say.

14:26.948 --> 14:28.483
I can't believe
I just said that.

14:28.982 --> 14:30.383
It's not funny.

14:34.989 --> 14:36.325
I told you I kept everything.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.494
Even your tighty whities.

14:39.794 --> 14:41.529
All right, man. Oh!

14:43.097 --> 14:44.332
Here. Before I forget.

14:45.066 --> 14:46.301
Present from Mom.

14:46.867 --> 14:47.834
All right.

14:47.836 --> 14:48.803
- You good?
- Yeah.

17:09.176 --> 17:11.743
He was so close to success.

17:11.746 --> 17:15.717
Alright? So close to saving his love.
So, why does he turn back?

17:16.383 --> 17:18.117
Why does he ruin everything?

17:18.118 --> 17:20.919
With all of his power
as a musician,

17:20.921 --> 17:23.887
all the perfection
of his talent,

17:23.890 --> 17:25.393
he's still only a mortal.

17:26.226 --> 17:28.461
And mortals are flawed.

17:28.463 --> 17:30.396
We are all of us,
cracked vessels.

17:30.398 --> 17:32.301
Hold on once second.
I'll be right back.

17:36.169 --> 17:37.272
Hildy.

17:38.872 --> 17:39.775
Hildy!

19:05.092 --> 19:06.958
Here.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.494
I may pay you a
visit at your place of residence,

19:09.496 --> 19:11.129
or your place
of employment.

19:11.131 --> 19:12.764
Such visits need not
be precipitated

19:12.766 --> 19:15.533
by advance notice
of any kind.

19:15.535 --> 19:18.637
These are the stipulations
as to movement and travel.

19:18.639 --> 19:20.942
You are to stay within
Snohomish County.

19:22.576 --> 19:25.211
A lot of guys get out
and think they're free.

19:25.213 --> 19:26.911
But you're not free yet.

19:26.913 --> 19:28.015
Not by a long shot.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.367
Ted?

19:48.369 --> 19:49.538
Yeah?

19:50.204 --> 19:51.340
Um...

19:52.672 --> 19:54.842
I'm trying to print this thing
and it went away.

19:55.909 --> 19:56.975
Where is it?

19:56.977 --> 19:57.879
Over here.

19:59.647 --> 20:01.082
You go up here,
to "file,"

20:02.048 --> 20:03.084
and "print."

20:27.941 --> 20:29.175
Thank you.

20:29.177 --> 20:30.411
Good night.

21:38.079 --> 21:41.480
<i>The cellular customer
you are calling is not available.</i>

21:41.482 --> 21:43.819
<i>Please leave your message
after the tone.</i>

21:55.963 --> 21:57.428
Hello.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.034
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

22:00.400 --> 22:01.702
Oh. Uh...

22:04.237 --> 22:05.571
<i>Hello?</i>

22:05.573 --> 22:07.609
Yes. Hi. Hi, how are you?

22:09.142 --> 22:11.246
<i>I'm good.
Uh, I was just...</i>

22:12.178 --> 22:13.582
<i>wondering what you were doing.</i>

22:14.314 --> 22:17.015
Um... Just, uh...

22:17.017 --> 22:19.587
you know, cleaning up after dinner.
What are you up to?

22:20.121 --> 22:21.219
<i>Um...</i>

22:21.221 --> 22:24.322
Not much. I was kind of
missing you a little bit.

22:24.324 --> 22:25.994
I was wondering if maybe
I could see you.

22:27.727 --> 22:28.763
Uh...

22:30.398 --> 22:31.733
Well, that's nice.

22:34.834 --> 22:36.971
Are you okay?
You sound weird.

22:38.538 --> 22:41.240
Um, yeah. Can you hold on
one second?

22:41.242 --> 22:42.277
Just hold on
one second.

22:52.152 --> 22:53.017
Hey.

22:53.019 --> 22:55.486
Hi, I'm sorry.
You just kind of...

22:55.488 --> 22:57.089
caught me by surprise there.

22:57.091 --> 22:59.425
Oh, I'm sorry.
I called your cell,

22:59.427 --> 23:02.293
but you didn't pick up, so I just...
I called the home phone.

23:02.295 --> 23:03.532
<i>I hope that's okay?</i>

23:04.230 --> 23:05.299
<i>How was your day?</i>

23:05.800 --> 23:07.366
Uh...

23:07.368 --> 23:08.803
It was fine.
How was your day?

23:09.370 --> 23:10.906
<i>Uh... Good.</i>

23:16.310 --> 23:17.178
You okay?

23:19.380 --> 23:21.049
Yeah, I don't know.
Um...

23:22.949 --> 23:25.818
<i>We got a bunch of
people over right now.</i>

23:25.820 --> 23:29.420
<i>I'm actually sort of
hiding out in the garage.</i>

23:29.422 --> 23:31.456
You're...
You're in the garage?

23:31.458 --> 23:33.792
Yeah. It's actually not bad.

23:33.794 --> 23:35.597
I mean, I kind of
like it in here.

23:37.698 --> 23:39.098
You know, maybe...

23:39.100 --> 23:41.132
Maybe they're not
so bad, Chris. You know?

23:41.134 --> 23:43.334
<i>Yeah, I don't know.
It's just...</i>

23:43.336 --> 23:47.339
There's like one girl, and her
voice is, like, really loud and...

23:47.341 --> 23:48.577
<i>I don't know.</i>

23:49.576 --> 23:51.776
Well, maybe it wouldn't be
the worst thing

23:51.778 --> 23:53.681
for you to meet
some girls either.

23:57.985 --> 23:59.283
Yeah.

23:59.285 --> 24:01.453
Of course, yeah.
I mean...

24:01.455 --> 24:05.523
It's just like girls that hang
out with my brother. I mean...

24:05.525 --> 24:06.760
I don't know.

24:09.330 --> 24:13.968
I just think spending time with
people, um, would be good for you.

24:14.534 --> 24:15.603
You know?

24:16.970 --> 24:19.673
<i>Give it an hour, okay?
And just see how it goes.</i>

24:22.075 --> 24:24.078
Just do it for me,
Chris, okay?

24:25.278 --> 24:26.678
All right. All right.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.984
All right.
I will do it for you.

24:31.552 --> 24:32.887
<i>Good night, Beasley.</i>

24:36.122 --> 24:37.092
Good night, Chris.

24:48.936 --> 24:50.769
- Definitely did.
- No, I didn't.

24:50.771 --> 24:52.404
- Katherine Donnley.
- Yeah, I know.

24:52.406 --> 24:54.807
- I know, 'cause she's my older sister.
- Oh.

24:54.809 --> 24:57.676
And I totally had the biggest
crush on you in Junior High.

24:57.678 --> 24:59.110
- You're Lindy?
- Linda.

24:59.112 --> 25:00.079
I remember.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.113
Put these in your mouth.
Drink them hard.

25:02.115 --> 25:03.081
Grab one.

25:03.083 --> 25:04.949
Come on, Chris.
Pop two of these in your...

25:04.951 --> 25:06.651
Guys, does Ted
have brain damage?

25:06.653 --> 25:07.888
Definitely.

25:08.522 --> 25:09.754
Dude, I told you.

25:09.756 --> 25:11.122
I'm on parole.
I can't fucking drink.

25:11.124 --> 25:13.324
These people know, but you
can't seem to remember.

25:13.326 --> 25:14.493
Mm.

25:14.495 --> 25:15.664
I got yours.

25:18.332 --> 25:19.333
Hey, man.

25:20.868 --> 25:22.167
- Slow down.
- We're done.

25:23.303 --> 25:25.404
- Can you hold this for one second?
- Yep. Got it.

25:25.406 --> 25:27.305
Okay, um, make a wish.

25:27.307 --> 25:29.841
I'll take the shot
and make your dreams come true.

25:29.843 --> 25:31.976
There's no ball
so there's no point in this.

25:31.978 --> 25:33.313
It's just a game.

25:45.426 --> 25:46.928
Hey, Connelly. What's up?

25:47.894 --> 25:49.797
Shane wanted to drop by
to say hey.

25:50.730 --> 25:52.099
How does
freedom feel, man?

25:52.932 --> 25:55.367
Um, I'll see you guys.

25:55.369 --> 25:57.668
Nice talking to you.
Cool.

25:57.670 --> 26:01.308
Listen, I just wanted to say
face-to-face I'm sorry, all right?

26:02.442 --> 26:03.942
I owe you one.

26:03.944 --> 26:05.878
Whatever you want, whatever you
need, you let me know, okay?

26:05.880 --> 26:07.247
Get the fuck off me.

26:16.957 --> 26:18.689
Where are you going?

26:18.691 --> 26:19.928
Fuck you, man.

26:22.329 --> 26:24.495
Get out of my way, or I'll run
this shit through you, I swear.

26:24.497 --> 26:26.764
He just came by to apologize and
say thank you. That's the only...

26:26.766 --> 26:28.266
You're fucking friends
with him?

26:28.268 --> 26:31.069
You're fucking friends with that
trigger-happy piece of shit?

26:31.071 --> 26:33.105
I'm not good friends with him,
he's just...

26:33.107 --> 26:36.041
You don't come to see me, and
you're hanging out with him?

26:36.043 --> 26:37.512
Maybe I should have
narced on you both.

27:36.803 --> 27:38.139
Are you okay?
What happened?

27:41.675 --> 27:43.774
Okay, stop. What are you doing?
What are you doing? Stop.

27:43.776 --> 27:45.142
Stop.
What are you doing?

27:45.144 --> 27:46.113
I love you.

27:49.283 --> 27:51.119
I love you
and I wanna be with you.

27:54.487 --> 27:56.821
Chris, I can't. I'm married.
I have a family.

27:56.823 --> 27:58.389
They're all in the house
right now.

27:58.391 --> 27:59.960
I know. I know.

28:01.094 --> 28:03.832
But I know you love me.
I know you need me.

28:07.501 --> 28:10.004
Chris, I have to...
I have to be with my family.

28:11.938 --> 28:13.173
I'm sorry.

28:16.643 --> 28:17.845
Is that it?

28:18.978 --> 28:20.611
You're just gonna
shut me out?

28:20.613 --> 28:23.083
No, no. I...
We can be friends.

28:24.083 --> 28:25.550
Chris, I think
we can be friends...

28:25.552 --> 28:26.521
We're not friends.

28:28.022 --> 28:30.958
I mean, you're the only person
I can talk to.

28:32.159 --> 28:33.594
You're everything to me.

28:34.762 --> 28:36.861
That's too much
pressure, Chris.

28:36.863 --> 28:38.030
It's too much for me.

28:38.032 --> 28:39.764
I know you feel that way
about me.

28:39.766 --> 28:41.166
I know you do.

28:41.168 --> 28:43.668
You told me I'm the only one
you can talk to.

28:43.670 --> 28:45.036
I have to fix that.

28:45.038 --> 28:47.071
- Why?
- Because that's the problem.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.974
I have to save
my marriage.

28:48.976 --> 28:51.243
I have to save my family.

28:51.245 --> 28:53.445
I've been messing it up there
for too long, okay? Please.

28:53.447 --> 28:55.847
I can't do this thing
where I can't even

28:55.849 --> 28:57.381
see you or talk to you.

28:57.383 --> 28:59.283
It was better before
when I was locked up,

28:59.285 --> 29:00.918
we could talk on
the phone for real.

29:00.920 --> 29:02.119
- Yes, I know. I know.
- This is...

29:02.121 --> 29:04.092
- I know, I know...
- Fuck!

29:14.435 --> 29:17.069
We can be friends, Chris.
I think we can be friends who...

29:17.071 --> 29:19.173
who can take care of each other
and...

29:21.175 --> 29:23.507
have each others backs
and stuff, okay?

29:23.509 --> 29:25.612
How are we gonna
be friends?

29:26.580 --> 29:27.448
I'm...

29:29.917 --> 29:32.583
Am I gonna come over to your house
and hang out with your family?

29:32.585 --> 29:33.784
Yes.

29:33.786 --> 29:35.753
- Yes, Chris. That's what you're gonna do.
- What?

29:35.755 --> 29:37.421
You're gonna come over,
and you can...

29:37.423 --> 29:40.694
get to know Hildy, and you
can get to know Tom, and...

29:42.563 --> 29:43.829
We can...

29:43.831 --> 29:45.030
spend time together.

29:45.032 --> 29:46.467
That's what friends do, okay?

29:49.069 --> 29:51.272
You want that?
That's what you want?

31:29.503 --> 31:30.371
What...

31:32.672 --> 31:33.573
are you doing?

31:35.042 --> 31:38.813
Uh... I was thinking maybe
we could...

31:42.315 --> 31:44.849
I've got work
in the morning.

31:44.851 --> 31:46.254
Oh, I know. I know.

31:49.689 --> 31:50.690
Carol.

31:54.361 --> 31:55.396
I can't.

31:57.898 --> 32:00.764
You know, but the doctor said
it's not entirely physical.

32:00.766 --> 32:03.201
I mean, we could try and...

32:03.203 --> 32:04.969
You know, we don't
have to do it.

32:04.971 --> 32:06.740
Carol...

32:07.474 --> 32:09.273
Please.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.111
Could you just let me
get some sleep.

32:16.550 --> 32:17.685
Okay, sure.

32:36.870 --> 32:39.337
Hildy, how many times do I have to
tell you to get dressed already?

32:39.339 --> 32:40.804
He's gonna be here
any minute.

32:40.806 --> 32:42.474
How many times
have I told you

32:42.476 --> 32:44.009
I will get ready
when he gets here.

32:44.011 --> 32:45.744
It literally takes me
30 seconds to get ready.

32:45.746 --> 32:46.744
Jesus.

32:46.746 --> 32:48.612
Hey, wait a second.

32:48.614 --> 32:51.218
Come back here, Hildy,
I'm speaking to you.

32:55.354 --> 32:57.421
So did I do something
to upset you,

32:57.423 --> 32:59.925
or was there something
you want to say to me?

32:59.927 --> 33:00.794
What?

33:03.697 --> 33:05.996
It's just 'cause
I'm a teenager, Mom.

33:05.998 --> 33:07.235
It's what teenage girls do.

33:15.141 --> 33:16.343
Okay.

33:41.567 --> 33:43.336
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:45.772 --> 33:47.308
Come on in.

33:47.940 --> 33:48.808
Okay.

33:49.342 --> 33:50.611
Well, this is it.

33:51.378 --> 33:52.409
Wow.

33:52.411 --> 33:55.312
It's, uh, not much,
but, works for us, so...

33:55.314 --> 33:56.583
It's very nice.

33:58.051 --> 34:00.918
Hildy's getting dressed.
She'll be out in just a minute.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.622
Hildy! Chris is here.

34:06.493 --> 34:08.458
Oh, Tom is at a car show
in Everett,

34:08.460 --> 34:09.960
so he sends his regards.

34:09.963 --> 34:11.629
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

34:11.630 --> 34:12.666
That's a bummer.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.601
Um... So, uh,
is that what I think it is?

34:18.603 --> 34:21.972
Oh, yes. Those boxes.
That's your case right there.

34:21.974 --> 34:23.373
- Wow.
- Yeah.

34:23.376 --> 34:26.745
- Pretty glamorous, huh?
- It's a lot, like 80 pounds...

34:26.746 --> 34:28.045
Yeah.

34:28.047 --> 34:29.417
- ...stuff right there.
- Hey, hi.

34:29.849 --> 34:30.884
Hildy, Chris.

34:31.485 --> 34:32.850
Oh, hey.

34:32.851 --> 34:35.523
Last time I saw you,
my head was in the toilet.

34:35.856 --> 34:37.054
Right.

34:37.056 --> 34:38.389
What's that?

34:38.391 --> 34:41.462
At the party, you know.
Anyway, it's stupid.

34:43.329 --> 34:45.396
What kind of toilets
do you guys got?

34:45.398 --> 34:48.399
Is it good?
Is it in good working order?

34:48.400 --> 34:50.934
I don't... really... know.

34:50.936 --> 34:53.103
'Cause I'm picky about
what I throw up in.

34:53.106 --> 34:55.907
'Cause I'm definitely gonna throw up, no offense.

34:55.909 --> 34:57.809
I mean, I have a lot
of volume when I puke.

34:57.811 --> 34:59.376
You saw, right? You saw.

34:59.378 --> 35:01.014
It's gonna be,
like, explosive.

35:01.514 --> 35:02.946
Okay.

35:02.948 --> 35:05.450
Well, Carol's cooking, so you might
find out how good the toilet is.

35:05.452 --> 35:07.017
- What?
- Hildy!

35:07.019 --> 35:09.720
That was good. It's a little
mean, but it was good.

35:09.722 --> 35:12.959
Yeah, it was a little bit mean.
But that's okay.

35:16.463 --> 35:19.030
Wait, wait. What about Mr.
Watsey, and the Watse hump?

35:19.032 --> 35:20.432
Is he still
five months pregnant?

35:20.434 --> 35:23.200
- He's still there and still...
- Farting.

35:23.202 --> 35:24.369
Oh, God, the flashlights.

35:24.371 --> 35:25.903
- What?
- Oh, my God.

35:25.905 --> 35:28.740
Figure it out, dude. Buy
some Gas-X or whatever.

35:28.742 --> 35:31.276
Don Watsey has
a farting problem?

35:31.278 --> 35:32.910
Oh, non-stop.
It's an epidemic.

35:32.912 --> 35:35.079
- It's like a serious problem.
- So toxic.

35:38.751 --> 35:40.020
Hey, who won?

35:40.921 --> 35:42.456
Vince, of course.

35:43.423 --> 35:44.588
He's here.

35:44.590 --> 35:47.225
- Hello, sir.
- Carol's kid, in the flesh.

35:47.227 --> 35:49.026
- Chris Connelly.
- Tom Beasley.

35:49.028 --> 35:49.994
Nice to meet you.

35:49.996 --> 35:51.229
Congrats
on your release.

35:51.231 --> 35:52.463
Thank you very much.

35:52.465 --> 35:54.067
Maybe now
I can get my wife back.

35:58.872 --> 35:59.940
Just joshing you.

36:04.010 --> 36:05.709
Let me get you
a plate.

36:05.711 --> 36:07.144
No, no.

36:07.146 --> 36:08.381
Don't bother.

36:13.619 --> 36:14.587
Oh.

36:17.356 --> 36:21.795
Generally they'd have hot dogs or some tacos,
but they didn't have squat over there.

36:22.628 --> 36:24.262
You were in a car show?

36:24.264 --> 36:26.631
Actually it was
a classic car competition.

36:26.633 --> 36:28.432
My buddy, Vince,
won the big one.

36:28.434 --> 36:29.968
He always does.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.369
Can I be excused?

36:31.371 --> 36:32.472
Sure.

36:36.276 --> 36:39.309
So, how is the job hunt
going?

36:39.311 --> 36:41.412
Pretty good.
Just starting out.

36:41.414 --> 36:43.448
I hear it's pretty tough.

36:43.450 --> 36:45.883
Carol asked me to check in
with the uppers at work,

36:45.885 --> 36:48.086
but we can't hire
any ex-felons.

36:48.088 --> 36:49.657
I appreciate that, sir.

36:50.791 --> 36:53.158
Yeah. Maybe I'll enroll
in some classes.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.760
You know, these days, everybody's
doing their business online.

36:55.762 --> 36:56.697
eBay...

36:57.164 --> 36:58.662
Gregslist...

36:58.664 --> 37:00.367
- So...
- Gregslist? Craigslist.

37:02.602 --> 37:05.706
And nobody knows
who's buying or selling.

37:07.407 --> 37:08.939
Scary as shit
if you ask me, but,

37:08.941 --> 37:11.111
in your case it might work
to your advantage.

37:28.861 --> 37:30.697
I don't know.
I think that went well.

37:31.398 --> 37:32.499
Right?

37:32.932 --> 37:33.867
Yeah.

37:35.401 --> 37:36.637
- So...
- You okay?

37:37.803 --> 37:39.102
Am I okay? Yeah.

37:39.104 --> 37:40.807
Yeah. I'm fine.

37:43.309 --> 37:44.675
Yeah.

37:44.677 --> 37:45.678
Okay.

37:46.479 --> 37:47.881
So what are we doing tomorrow?

37:48.981 --> 37:51.515
Bowling 10:00 a.m.?
We could get our nails done?

37:51.517 --> 37:53.718
We're buds now. We gotta hang.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.586
Oh, you know, I was thinking,
this is a...

37:55.588 --> 37:57.521
You know, this is
a difficult time for you,

37:57.523 --> 37:58.856
'cause you know,
you just got out

37:58.858 --> 38:02.093
and you have nothing but time
on your hands, you know.

38:02.095 --> 38:03.595
When I would talk to you,

38:03.597 --> 38:05.629
you know,
couple of times a week,

38:05.631 --> 38:08.198
that was kind of all
the free time I had, you know.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.871
I have my job.
I have the family, um...

38:11.805 --> 38:14.204
The guys
at Ending Mandatory Minimums

38:14.206 --> 38:16.776
actually said they may have
another client for me.

38:17.510 --> 38:19.042
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:19.044 --> 38:20.077
Can you believe it?

38:20.079 --> 38:20.980
Who is it?

38:21.514 --> 38:22.713
Who's the client?

38:22.715 --> 38:24.484
Oh, I don't know.
They didn't say.

38:27.653 --> 38:30.220
So you're gonna work with
them, like, full time?

38:30.222 --> 38:32.122
No. No, no.
They...

38:32.124 --> 38:34.959
They seem to think
I have kind of a, you know...

38:34.961 --> 38:37.428
you know, knack for this,
so... maybe...

38:37.430 --> 38:41.032
Who knows? Maybe I could, you
know, do some good in the world.

38:41.034 --> 38:43.166
It might be a...
I mean, some more good.

38:43.168 --> 38:44.704
- Yeah.
- More good in the world.

38:45.372 --> 38:46.707
So, I don't know...

38:49.108 --> 38:50.543
Okay. Yeah.

38:51.477 --> 38:52.713
Yeah.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.546
But we're just gonna...

38:55.548 --> 38:56.916
hang out once a week?

38:58.985 --> 38:59.954
That's it?

39:00.921 --> 39:03.224
Um, you know,
I don't know.

39:05.057 --> 39:06.059
Uh...

39:07.561 --> 39:09.059
Okay.

39:09.061 --> 39:10.394
All right. Okay.

39:10.396 --> 39:11.629
We'll just have to...

39:11.631 --> 39:13.033
We'll see, okay?
'Cause I don't know.

39:19.204 --> 39:20.671
All right.

39:20.673 --> 39:22.372
Well, thanks for breakfast,
I guess.

39:22.374 --> 39:24.608
Thank you for coming.
Thanks for coming.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.646
And I guess I'll just see you
when I see you.

40:00.512 --> 40:01.648
Hey.

40:02.648 --> 40:03.715
- Hey.
- What's up?

40:03.717 --> 40:05.052
- Hey, man.
- Yeah.

40:05.852 --> 40:06.787
Hey.

40:08.153 --> 40:09.553
- How's it going?
- Good.

40:09.555 --> 40:12.023
We're just doing bath time.

40:12.025 --> 40:13.291
- Oh.
- You okay?

40:13.293 --> 40:14.691
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:14.693 --> 40:17.629
You just mentioned to come by,
so I looked you up and...

40:17.631 --> 40:19.530
- This is great, man.
- Thank you.

40:19.532 --> 40:21.532
The cul-de-sac
and everything.

40:21.534 --> 40:23.166
Yeah, you know
how I do.

40:23.168 --> 40:26.137
Um, so yeah, man. It's like a
crime scene in there right now.

40:26.139 --> 40:29.073
We're just doing
bath time, and...

40:29.075 --> 40:31.675
Baby's sick, so we're just
scrambling, but, um,

40:31.677 --> 40:33.010
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

40:33.012 --> 40:35.046
Yeah. I was just
gonna say hi, whatever.

40:35.048 --> 40:35.946
Yeah. No, no, no.

40:35.948 --> 40:37.515
What about later?
Are you free later?

40:37.517 --> 40:38.886
- Yeah, uh, maybe.
- No!

40:39.285 --> 40:40.484
Uh...

40:40.486 --> 40:42.789
Yeah. Just, uh, text me.

40:43.322 --> 40:44.388
- Yeah.
- Okay.

40:44.390 --> 40:45.722
- Cool?
- Cool.

40:45.724 --> 40:46.890
We could do that.

40:46.892 --> 40:48.892
Hey, you still
got the bike, man.

40:48.894 --> 40:51.831
- It's pretty strong.
- Yeah. That's the one, man.

40:52.666 --> 40:54.499
- Cool.
- 20 years of rust.

40:54.501 --> 40:55.566
- Cool.
- And counting.

40:55.568 --> 40:57.100
Yeah.

40:57.102 --> 40:58.171
- Yeah.
- Very cool.

40:58.938 --> 41:00.738
- All right.
- All right. Well...

41:00.740 --> 41:01.939
Cool.

41:01.941 --> 41:03.408
- I guess...
- All right.

41:03.410 --> 41:05.075
Get in there, man. It sounds
like your kids are drowning.

41:05.077 --> 41:06.943
Yeah, I'm the one
who's drowning.

41:06.945 --> 41:08.646
Help me.

41:08.648 --> 41:09.950
- See you.
- All right.

43:04.963 --> 43:05.898
Shit.

43:06.398 --> 43:08.365
- Hey.
- Sorry.

43:08.367 --> 43:09.499
What are you doing here?

43:09.501 --> 43:11.202
I didn't know
you worked here.

43:11.204 --> 43:12.406
- Yeah.
- Um...

43:13.639 --> 43:15.205
I was gonna, um...

43:15.207 --> 43:17.774
get some food or whatever. I just
realized I forgot my wallet.

43:17.776 --> 43:19.209
So I'm just gonna
grab it.

43:19.211 --> 43:21.912
Oh. I can hook you up.
What do you want?

43:21.914 --> 43:23.580
No, I'm sorry. I don't
want you to do that.

43:23.582 --> 43:24.952
No, seriously.
It's all good.

43:26.019 --> 43:26.919
Really?

43:29.322 --> 43:30.488
Corn dog?

43:30.490 --> 43:32.990
Okay. You want some fries?

43:32.992 --> 43:34.959
- Nah.
- Some cheese fries?

43:34.961 --> 43:36.296
I'll put some fries in.

43:46.905 --> 43:49.039
Hey, Courtney,
this is Chris.

43:49.041 --> 43:50.675
- Hey.
- Chris?

43:50.677 --> 43:52.242
Oh, yeah.
You called about the job?

43:52.244 --> 43:54.812
Um, yeah.

43:54.814 --> 43:56.784
Let me grab an application.

44:02.354 --> 44:03.456
Um...

44:04.557 --> 44:06.126
Mr. Watsey deliver
his baby yet?

44:07.660 --> 44:11.829
If by "baby" you mean
"fart baby," yes.

44:11.831 --> 44:13.698
Cute little eight pounder
in third period.

44:13.700 --> 44:14.932
- Whoa.
- Yes.

44:14.934 --> 44:16.503
That's a big one.

44:18.303 --> 44:19.238
Yeah.

44:19.905 --> 44:21.606
Thank you for your purchase.

44:21.608 --> 44:23.477
Oh, thank you so much.

44:24.543 --> 44:26.209
I owe you one.

44:26.211 --> 44:28.345
You wanna fill it
out here, or take it with you?

44:28.347 --> 44:29.847
Um...

44:29.849 --> 44:32.350
I gotta go.
But, thank you.

44:32.352 --> 44:34.318
And nice to meet you.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.322
- Bye.
- Bye.

44:38.858 --> 44:41.325
Hey, um...

44:41.327 --> 44:45.599
I was wondering if you wanted
to hang out some time maybe?

44:47.800 --> 44:49.233
Yeah. Sure.

44:49.235 --> 44:52.939
Yeah, it's like...
family sort of...

44:55.541 --> 44:57.410
Yeah. Cool.

44:58.343 --> 45:00.046
Rad. Okay, um...

45:01.079 --> 45:03.516
Well, you can put your number
in here and...

45:03.950 --> 45:05.118
I'll text you.

45:06.285 --> 45:07.220
Okay.

45:10.155 --> 45:13.791
Um, I don't know if my phone
does the texting thing.

45:13.793 --> 45:15.459
Okay. Well, I'll try.

45:15.461 --> 45:18.729
But if that doesn't work, I can
call you on the telephone.

45:18.731 --> 45:19.963
- All right.
- That's better.

45:19.965 --> 45:21.365
- Rad.
- Okay.

45:21.367 --> 45:22.399
- All right.
- Cool.

45:22.401 --> 45:23.269
All right.

45:28.106 --> 45:30.274
I can't believe
he killed a guy.

45:30.276 --> 45:32.209
He's just a little
puppy dog.

45:32.211 --> 45:35.680
He didn't kill anybody. He was
just there when it all went down.

45:35.682 --> 45:37.950
Wrong place, wrong time
kind of thing.

45:38.584 --> 45:39.749
It's fucked up.

45:39.751 --> 45:41.218
Yeah.

45:41.220 --> 45:43.523
He didn't even know the guy
he was with had a gun.

45:45.425 --> 45:47.093
He was just trying
to get some beer.

46:29.168 --> 46:30.137
Hey.

46:30.669 --> 46:31.671
Hey.

46:33.171 --> 46:34.507
Nice place you got here.

46:35.575 --> 46:36.510
Thanks.

46:39.211 --> 46:40.146
Come on.

46:40.780 --> 46:41.948
All right.

46:46.852 --> 46:48.220
You live here now?

46:49.021 --> 46:50.556
Um...

46:51.057 --> 46:52.622
not exactly.

46:52.624 --> 46:53.724
All right.

46:53.726 --> 46:54.727
I wish.

46:56.061 --> 46:59.131
So, what is like
the most different?

47:01.867 --> 47:03.135
Cell phones.

47:04.102 --> 47:05.236
Smart phones.

47:05.238 --> 47:07.104
Whatever everyone's
obsessed with.

47:07.106 --> 47:10.274
And the texting, man.

47:10.276 --> 47:13.213
I guess I'm gonna get used to it.

47:14.213 --> 47:15.182
Jesus!

47:16.948 --> 47:18.552
So did you get
a job yet?

47:19.985 --> 47:22.419
Nope.

47:22.421 --> 47:25.726
People do not wanna hire a
murderer for some reason.

47:27.126 --> 47:30.227
Don't say that. You're
like the opposite of that.

47:30.229 --> 47:34.131
My mom said that you tried
to save that guy,

47:34.133 --> 47:36.035
and that's how you got caught.

47:37.235 --> 47:39.572
You stayed back
while everyone ran off.

47:40.673 --> 47:42.042
Yeah, but...

47:43.443 --> 47:45.544
I was in for 20 years,
so it's like...

47:46.646 --> 47:48.448
I'm learning that's how

47:49.314 --> 47:52.216
people are always
gonna see me.

47:52.218 --> 47:55.155
It's like the whole world
sees me as a criminal now.

48:00.425 --> 48:02.059
So...

48:02.061 --> 48:04.662
What was...
What was it like?

48:04.664 --> 48:05.698
Was it scary?

48:07.934 --> 48:10.100
You're just like
in there, you know.

48:10.102 --> 48:12.472
I mean, it's like...
It's... It's...

48:12.905 --> 48:14.207
It is scary.

48:19.177 --> 48:20.479
How'd you get through it?

48:25.284 --> 48:27.820
Your mom
is who got me through it.

48:30.990 --> 48:32.059
Really?

48:33.358 --> 48:34.260
Yeah.

48:35.695 --> 48:37.660
You know, like,
first she just

48:37.662 --> 48:39.329
kept being my teacher.

48:39.331 --> 48:42.198
And like, you know,
she would

48:42.200 --> 48:43.702
give me assignments and...

48:44.537 --> 48:45.336
Ew!

48:45.338 --> 48:46.336
Made me read books.

48:46.338 --> 48:47.840
That's what cheered you up?

48:48.508 --> 48:49.541
Seriously?

48:49.543 --> 48:51.242
Yeah. I mean, it was
kind of amazing, you know.

48:51.244 --> 48:53.711
It was like distracting me
from, like...

48:53.713 --> 48:56.216
all the bullshit going on
around me, you know.

48:58.985 --> 49:01.787
It's weird. It's like you're
describing someone I barely know.

49:02.889 --> 49:04.091
Hey.

49:07.660 --> 49:09.162
Your mom's incredible.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.232
And there's, like,
nobody like her.

49:13.064 --> 49:14.834
I mean, everybody faded away.

49:16.302 --> 49:17.700
But she was there for me,
you know.

49:17.702 --> 49:20.439
Even my own fucking retarded
family didn't give a shit.

49:22.642 --> 49:23.577
What?

49:25.343 --> 49:27.179
You can't say that word
anymore.

49:27.947 --> 49:29.115
What word?

49:29.615 --> 49:31.314
"Retarded."

49:31.316 --> 49:32.885
It's not...
It's not cool.

50:05.684 --> 50:06.619
Hey.

50:07.086 --> 50:08.188
Hi.

50:09.287 --> 50:10.590
Where were you?

50:12.657 --> 50:13.526
Out.

50:14.927 --> 50:17.430
Hildy, I don't want you out
this late by yourself.

50:18.197 --> 50:19.599
I wasn't by myself.

50:19.999 --> 50:21.231
Oh?

50:21.233 --> 50:22.568
I was with Chris.

50:24.135 --> 50:26.505
He came by work to apply
for a job, so...

50:28.773 --> 50:29.642
Oh.

50:30.943 --> 50:31.878
Okay.

50:37.182 --> 50:38.318
Hey, Dad.

50:54.099 --> 50:55.401
You okay with that?

50:56.901 --> 50:58.702
Okay with what?

50:58.704 --> 51:01.575
Our daughter alone
with a 40-year-old ex-con?

51:14.186 --> 51:16.019
It's fine if you do
your charity work,

51:16.021 --> 51:18.757
but I'd rather you not
bring it home in the future.

51:21.626 --> 51:23.559
Tom, if we're gonna have
a serious conversation,

51:23.561 --> 51:25.729
do you think maybe you could
turn the television off, please?

51:25.731 --> 51:27.867
I'm done.
I got nothing more to say.

51:31.037 --> 51:34.374
So then, I guess this is the
end of our discussion, then.

51:49.287 --> 51:50.556
What's up, man?

52:00.633 --> 52:01.768
Oh, my God.

52:02.568 --> 52:03.870
Chris,
you should see this.

52:09.675 --> 52:11.878
Chris. Chris,
come look at this.

52:12.510 --> 52:13.479
I'm good.

52:15.847 --> 52:17.050
Chris, come on.

52:35.633 --> 52:37.501
What channel is this?

52:37.503 --> 52:39.905
It's just Internet videos.

52:41.374 --> 52:43.340
It's on your TV.

52:43.342 --> 52:46.477
Yeah, but we used the WiFi
to get...

52:46.479 --> 52:48.312
the computer stuff
on the TV.

52:48.314 --> 52:49.949
Watch this.
Watch, for real, watch.

52:52.450 --> 52:53.919
Watch this, watch this,
watch this.

52:56.188 --> 52:57.354
All right,
I gotta go to work.

52:57.356 --> 52:58.491
Dave is sick.

52:59.392 --> 53:01.057
Okay.
I'll see you later, Chris.

53:01.059 --> 53:03.059
You don't have to go anywhere.
You can stay here.

53:03.061 --> 53:04.330
Chris, is it okay
if she stays?

53:05.831 --> 53:06.829
Mm-hmm.

53:06.831 --> 53:09.902
And I leave you
with this masterpiece.

53:12.037 --> 53:13.336
Enjoy.
I'll see you at work.

53:13.338 --> 53:14.606
All right. Later.

53:17.876 --> 53:20.380
How long you been
working at the restaurant?

53:21.414 --> 53:22.615
Couple of years.

53:25.450 --> 53:26.952
You mind if I put
my feet up?

53:28.253 --> 53:29.521
No, I'm fine.

53:36.796 --> 53:39.899
So what are you into, besides,
like, Internet videos?

53:42.001 --> 53:43.466
What do you mean?

53:43.468 --> 53:46.005
Like books and stuff?
Do you read?

53:47.472 --> 53:49.539
Yeah. I read books. Yeah.

53:49.541 --> 53:51.076
What kind of stuff
do you read?

53:51.811 --> 53:53.012
Mm...

53:53.445 --> 53:54.813
Shakespeare.

53:56.314 --> 53:57.483
Really?

53:58.483 --> 54:00.619
Yeah. No, no.

54:01.753 --> 54:03.722
You don't know
how to read?

54:06.291 --> 54:08.124
So, what about movies
and stuff?

54:08.126 --> 54:09.128
You like movies?

54:10.563 --> 54:12.896
Yeah, I like movies.

54:12.898 --> 54:14.164
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

54:14.166 --> 54:15.068
What kind?

54:17.669 --> 54:18.704
Um...

54:20.506 --> 54:22.142
I like the <i>Saw</i> movies.

54:39.390 --> 54:40.726
You don't have to do that.

54:43.028 --> 54:44.061
I know.

54:44.063 --> 54:46.497
I'm just saying,
if Ted mentioned something,

54:46.499 --> 54:48.599
or if he asked you to...

54:48.601 --> 54:50.399
Jesus! Ted is not my pimp.

54:50.401 --> 54:53.039
I didn't mean it like that. I
was just trying to make sure...

54:54.206 --> 54:55.204
I'm sorry.

54:55.206 --> 54:56.775
- I do what I want.
- I'm sorry.

55:15.561 --> 55:16.930
Oh, God!

55:17.363 --> 55:19.428
Oh! Oh!

55:19.430 --> 55:21.097
Fuck! I'm sorry.

55:21.099 --> 55:22.365
I'm sorry.

55:22.367 --> 55:23.469
I'm sorry.

55:25.070 --> 55:27.006
Oh.

55:54.832 --> 55:55.735
Hello?

55:56.968 --> 55:58.167
<i>Hi.</i>

55:58.169 --> 56:00.173
Hi. Are you okay?

56:00.606 --> 56:02.606
<i>I just, uh...</i>

56:02.608 --> 56:04.274
What's going on?
What's the matter?

56:04.276 --> 56:07.945
<i>Um... Yeah, I just had kind
of a rough night over here.</i>

56:07.947 --> 56:10.015
<i>I just needed to talk
to my friend.</i>

56:12.550 --> 56:14.216
- I'm coming over.
- <i>What?</i>

56:14.218 --> 56:15.952
- <i>What? No, no.</i>
- No, no.

56:15.954 --> 56:18.521
No, I'm coming over.
You need me, and I'm coming.

56:18.523 --> 56:20.292
<i>No. Chris, don't come
over here.</i>

56:21.392 --> 56:22.792
<i>Um...</i>

56:22.794 --> 56:24.530
<i>Let's meet somewhere.</i>

56:30.235 --> 56:32.936
Um... Sorry about this,
but, uh...

56:32.938 --> 56:35.775
something just came up,
and I gotta go.

56:37.543 --> 56:38.841
Okay.

56:38.843 --> 56:40.276
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

56:40.278 --> 56:41.311
Is everything okay?

56:41.313 --> 56:42.682
Uh, yeah. Um...

56:43.314 --> 56:44.983
Uh, you can stay.

56:45.584 --> 56:48.184
It's just I... um...

56:48.186 --> 56:52.055
Could you just do the lock on the
doorknob when you leave, okay?

56:52.057 --> 56:53.256
Is that cool?

56:53.258 --> 56:54.624
All right.

56:54.626 --> 56:56.028
I'll see you later, okay?

56:56.695 --> 56:57.963
All right. I'm sorry.

57:00.999 --> 57:01.934
Bye.

57:23.521 --> 57:24.756
Thanks for coming.

57:26.325 --> 57:27.727
I'm always here for you.

58:34.492 --> 58:36.158
Oh, Jesus!

58:36.160 --> 58:38.128
Chris, you scared me!

58:38.130 --> 58:39.296
Oh, my God!

58:39.298 --> 58:40.629
You can't do that.

58:40.631 --> 58:42.532
- Why?
- You scared me.

58:42.534 --> 58:43.669
Sorry, Beasley.

58:44.535 --> 58:45.771
What's going on?

58:46.572 --> 58:48.137
Um...

58:48.139 --> 58:50.039
Not much. Just...

58:50.041 --> 58:52.010
gonna go to a friend's house.
You wanna come?

58:53.311 --> 58:55.313
Uh... I don't know.

58:56.682 --> 58:57.613
It'll be fun.

58:57.615 --> 58:58.751
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:00.385 --> 59:01.320
Hey.

59:26.410 --> 59:27.412
Hey.

59:29.014 --> 59:29.981
Hey.

59:31.650 --> 59:32.852
Hildy.

01:00:08.419 --> 01:00:10.490
What are you doing?
This is your friend's house?

01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:13.092
No.

01:00:13.758 --> 01:00:15.024
Um...

01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:16.626
Let's go.
We gotta go.

01:00:16.628 --> 01:00:18.061
I just need one more second.

01:00:18.063 --> 01:00:20.298
Uh... Dude, I'm on parole.

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:23.466
Oh, fuck.

01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:25.905
Uh... Of course. All right.

01:00:37.282 --> 01:00:39.050
I don't really wanna
talk to her.

01:00:41.019 --> 01:00:41.921
Why?

01:00:42.988 --> 01:00:44.423
'Cause she's...

01:00:45.557 --> 01:00:47.122
She has no right.

01:00:47.124 --> 01:00:49.492
I mean, she's been AWOL for the
past couple of years, and...

01:00:49.494 --> 01:00:52.497
and all of a sudden she wants to
be my best friend? Fuck that.

01:00:57.501 --> 01:00:59.070
That's kind of
my fault though.

01:00:59.738 --> 01:01:01.040
To be fair.

01:01:02.206 --> 01:01:04.142
You were just trying
to get out of jail.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:24.197
Can I show you something?

01:02:24.488 --> 01:02:25.358
Um...

01:02:26.825 --> 01:02:28.895
This is...
This is unbelievable.

01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:32.198
Has anybody seen this?

01:02:34.166 --> 01:02:35.901
Well, you gotta show somebody.

01:02:38.769 --> 01:02:39.970
I just did.

01:02:39.972 --> 01:02:42.405
No. I mean,
somebody like important.

01:02:42.407 --> 01:02:45.010
At least somebody
with a camera or something.

01:02:46.677 --> 01:02:47.913
Whatever.

01:02:51.082 --> 01:02:53.582
So, what's with this
party tonight?

01:02:53.584 --> 01:02:56.688
Oh. Yeah, it's just my
dumbass brother's birthday.

01:02:59.224 --> 01:03:02.428
Well... I should
come with you.

01:03:05.597 --> 01:03:07.329
Mm...

01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:10.332
Honestly, my house is kind
of a nightmare right now,

01:03:10.334 --> 01:03:12.671
and I'd rather just be hanging
out at a party with you.

01:03:48.673 --> 01:03:50.407
I'm going to go to the bathroom.
You good?

01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:52.041
Yeah, I'm good.
It's right over there.

01:03:52.043 --> 01:03:53.142
I remember.

01:03:53.144 --> 01:03:55.046
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

01:03:57.282 --> 01:03:58.184
Hi.

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.550
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:02.320
- Cheers.
- Oh, thanks.

01:04:05.322 --> 01:04:06.823
I think I'm gonna
have a beer.

01:04:06.825 --> 01:04:07.856
I'm gonna have an actual...

01:04:07.858 --> 01:04:09.361
- Really?
- Yes.

01:04:11.762 --> 01:04:13.498
World is not gonna end,
you know.

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:16.733
Who's that?

01:04:16.735 --> 01:04:18.371
She's a friend of mine.

01:04:22.106 --> 01:04:23.675
You drinking?
You drinking a beer?

01:04:39.023 --> 01:04:40.590
- Here we go.
- It's all right.

01:05:01.512 --> 01:05:03.579
Oh! It's my birthday!

01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:05.148
Everybody grab a drink,

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:08.684
except for Chris and the
teeny bopper over there.

01:05:08.686 --> 01:05:11.354
But maybe we can get you like a Capri
Sun, or like a water or something.

01:05:11.356 --> 01:05:13.923
But for the rest of your guys,
have fun, drink up.

01:05:17.195 --> 01:05:19.294
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold it.

01:05:19.296 --> 01:05:21.564
We have a toast to Ted.

01:05:21.566 --> 01:05:23.332
- It's what we need to do.
- We don't need to do a toast.

01:05:23.334 --> 01:05:25.068
Oh, yes, we do.
We need to toast

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.437
to my drunk-ass
little baby brother,

01:05:27.439 --> 01:05:30.273
who let me rot
up in Walla Walla for 20 years,

01:05:30.275 --> 01:05:31.573
barely came to see me,

01:05:31.575 --> 01:05:33.845
and never said shit
about what he did, right?

01:05:35.847 --> 01:05:37.115
To Tedster, right?

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.419
Mm!

01:05:43.421 --> 01:05:45.454
Drink up, everybody,
come on.

01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:48.093
It's a party. It's a
birthday party, everybody.

01:05:53.597 --> 01:05:56.131
Hey, what's your fucking
problem, man?

01:05:56.133 --> 01:05:58.033
What's your fucking
problem?

01:05:58.035 --> 01:06:00.436
I fucking took the rap for
you, and you don't even...

01:06:00.438 --> 01:06:02.307
It's like you don't even
give a shit about me.

01:06:07.945 --> 01:06:09.148
Come on.

01:06:33.905 --> 01:06:36.539
Fuck! Ow.

01:06:41.646 --> 01:06:42.945
Oh, man.

01:06:42.947 --> 01:06:44.150
I'm sorry.

01:06:44.648 --> 01:06:46.351
Oh, my God. Here.

01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:50.356
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:06:52.823 --> 01:06:54.159
Let's, um...

01:06:55.026 --> 01:06:56.562
Hey, you wanna ride
on the back?

01:06:57.928 --> 01:06:58.995
Okay.

01:06:58.997 --> 01:06:59.899
We can pick that up
tomorrow, okay?

01:07:00.965 --> 01:07:02.168
Okay.

01:07:08.872 --> 01:07:10.138
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.341
All right. Here we go.

01:07:11.343 --> 01:07:12.809
It's gonna be wobbly at
first, okay?

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:13.678
Okay.

01:07:15.012 --> 01:07:16.713
- Whoa.
- Here we go.

01:07:16.715 --> 01:07:17.749
Here we go.

01:07:19.084 --> 01:07:20.383
Okay.

01:08:07.798 --> 01:08:09.532
Where have you been?

01:08:09.534 --> 01:08:12.035
Oh, my God, Hildy.
What happened to you?

01:08:12.037 --> 01:08:13.606
- What happened to her?
- She fell.

01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:15.541
She fell off her bike.

01:08:16.106 --> 01:08:17.375
It's fine, Mom.

01:08:18.143 --> 01:08:19.578
Hildy, are you drunk?

01:08:20.312 --> 01:08:21.714
- No. Stop.
- Hildy!

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.345
Did you get her drunk?

01:08:24.348 --> 01:08:25.479
I didn't get her drunk.
I'm sorry.

01:08:25.482 --> 01:08:27.015
What is wrong with you?

01:08:27.018 --> 01:08:28.216
- She was drinking and I didn't realize.
- What were you thinking?

01:08:28.219 --> 01:08:29.551
I was trying to help her.
Okay?

01:08:29.554 --> 01:08:30.752
This is you trying to help?

01:08:30.754 --> 01:08:33.388
Yeah. She's having
a hard time, okay?

01:08:33.390 --> 01:08:36.327
She doesn't want to be in the house
with you guys, and I don't blame her.

01:08:40.331 --> 01:08:41.529
Go home, Chris.

01:08:41.532 --> 01:08:43.701
I will take care of my family.
Thank you.

01:09:43.795 --> 01:09:45.993
- <i>Put it down.</i>
- <i>What are you doing, man?</i>

01:09:45.996 --> 01:09:47.129
<i>Fucking put it down.</i>

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:48.698
<i>What the fuck
are you doing here?</i>

01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.166
<i>Put it
in the fucking bag.</i>

01:09:50.167 --> 01:09:51.399
<i>Put the gun down</i>

01:09:51.402 --> 01:09:52.635
<i>I'm gonna
fucking shoot you.</i>

01:09:52.636 --> 01:09:54.169
<i>No, no, no, no!</i>

01:10:32.677 --> 01:10:33.579
Carol.

01:10:34.312 --> 01:10:35.546
I'm sorry.

01:10:36.481 --> 01:10:38.015
I'm so sorry
I let that happen.

01:10:40.951 --> 01:10:43.185
That's your kid, and I was
supposed to be the grownup

01:10:43.187 --> 01:10:47.256
and I was supposed to take care
of her, and I didn't do that.

01:10:47.258 --> 01:10:51.597
And I let you down. And I'm really sorry.
And I feel horrible.

01:11:01.705 --> 01:11:02.607
Okay.

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:08.580
Okay.

01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:11.646
All right. Listen... Look,

01:11:11.648 --> 01:11:13.919
I know I've been
a pain in the ass, all right?

01:11:14.352 --> 01:11:15.650
But I...

01:11:15.652 --> 01:11:17.856
This has...
This has been really hard.

01:11:19.723 --> 01:11:21.726
This is like so much
harder than I thought.

01:11:24.329 --> 01:11:25.496
I have an idea.

01:11:33.537 --> 01:11:35.640
What if we just spent
one day together?

01:11:39.043 --> 01:11:40.008
Just like one day,

01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:42.712
where you can just be you,
and I can be me,

01:11:42.714 --> 01:11:45.280
and we can be together. We don't
have to touch each other.

01:11:45.282 --> 01:11:47.048
It's not even about that.

01:11:47.050 --> 01:11:49.752
I feel like if I had that,
I could move on.

01:11:49.754 --> 01:11:51.921
You know?
And leave you alone.

01:11:51.923 --> 01:11:52.825
And, um...

01:11:54.325 --> 01:11:55.760
If that's what you want.

01:12:02.267 --> 01:12:05.504
Look, I know you're going to
Seattle this weekend, right?

01:12:07.037 --> 01:12:10.808
I know the EMM stuff is super
important, but I just...

01:12:12.809 --> 01:12:14.743
If you could just
skip it this one time,

01:12:14.745 --> 01:12:17.048
just so we could spend
a little time together.

01:12:22.487 --> 01:12:24.287
All right.

01:12:24.289 --> 01:12:27.657
Look, just think about it. I'm gonna be
at the park on Friday, after school.

01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:29.527
I'm gonna be waiting there,
all right?

01:13:04.262 --> 01:13:05.531
Hi.

01:13:06.397 --> 01:13:07.299
Hi.

01:13:10.768 --> 01:13:12.037
Can I give you a ride home?

01:13:13.271 --> 01:13:14.305
I have work, Mom.

01:13:18.610 --> 01:13:20.376
Honey, you understand
why I was upset, right?

01:13:20.378 --> 01:13:23.048
Are you gonna try to keep
me from seeing Chris, too?

01:13:26.017 --> 01:13:28.787
He doesn't have a family.
He has no one.

01:13:31.222 --> 01:13:32.323
I gotta go.

01:15:50.228 --> 01:15:51.427
Huh? What are you doing?

01:15:51.429 --> 01:15:52.895
I'm sorry.

01:15:52.897 --> 01:15:55.000
Oh, God...
I'm sorry.

01:15:58.135 --> 01:15:59.071
You okay?

01:15:59.704 --> 01:16:00.972
What's the matter?

01:16:01.772 --> 01:16:03.107
Nothing. I don't know.

01:16:04.275 --> 01:16:05.410
Just let me go, okay?

01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:08.112
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

01:16:30.802 --> 01:16:32.403
I got ten minutes
What's up?

01:16:33.771 --> 01:16:35.439
I think we need to
go to counseling.

01:16:38.608 --> 01:16:40.312
You wanna keep
living like this?

01:16:41.812 --> 01:16:43.812
Why do you keep
harping on this?

01:16:43.814 --> 01:16:46.114
We've made it this far.

01:16:46.116 --> 01:16:49.387
Well, this is shit, Tom. We're
living in shit right now.

01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:53.655
Here's what I think.

01:16:53.657 --> 01:16:57.027
I think we're living a normal
life, just like everybody else.

01:17:00.263 --> 01:17:02.266
I'll retire
in about five years.

01:17:03.134 --> 01:17:06.068
And then we can do
whatever we want.

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.037
See, this is why
we need counseling,

01:17:08.039 --> 01:17:09.805
'cause there is
no communication.

01:17:09.807 --> 01:17:12.408
Like, I don't even wanna retire.

01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:15.514
I'd love the work like I did with Chris.
Like, that...

01:17:16.379 --> 01:17:17.745
I'm good at that.

01:17:17.747 --> 01:17:18.950
I like that.

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.990
Carol, that is what has
been dragging us down.

01:17:25.889 --> 01:17:27.224
Down from what?

01:19:31.816 --> 01:19:33.652
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on a second.

01:19:34.652 --> 01:19:35.954
It's too dangerous.

01:19:36.853 --> 01:19:38.622
- What?
- They might recognize us.

01:19:41.659 --> 01:19:42.757
Oh.

01:19:42.759 --> 01:19:44.793
- Put that on.
- Oh, come on.

01:19:44.795 --> 01:19:46.631
- Come on, put it on.
- Get out of here.

01:19:49.265 --> 01:19:50.932
Chris...

01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:52.303
Does it look like
I'm fucking around?

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.242
- All right.
- Let's see it.

01:20:01.277 --> 01:20:03.048
Do I look as good
as I feel?

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.050
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yeah. All right.

01:20:18.362 --> 01:20:20.498
We are totally freaking
everybody out here.

01:20:24.035 --> 01:20:25.336
Come on, come on.

01:20:28.304 --> 01:20:29.273
Go.

01:20:30.006 --> 01:20:31.308
You first.

01:20:36.513 --> 01:20:37.548
Not bad.

01:20:37.915 --> 01:20:39.050
I won.

01:20:49.259 --> 01:20:51.662
Oh, my God.
This is so good.

01:21:07.812 --> 01:21:09.677
Okay.

01:21:09.679 --> 01:21:11.212
Where to next?

01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:13.114
I don't know.
It's getting late.

01:21:13.116 --> 01:21:15.052
I don't know
how we could top that.

01:21:16.487 --> 01:21:18.089
- That was pretty great.
- Yeah.

01:21:20.191 --> 01:21:22.727
Um, well, what do you wanna do?

01:21:50.554 --> 01:21:51.656
Um...

01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:55.826
I know I said
I wasn't gonna, but...

01:21:58.228 --> 01:22:00.097
I really wanna
kiss you right now.

01:22:11.741 --> 01:22:13.077
Will it be okay?

01:23:07.731 --> 01:23:08.633
I can't.

01:24:01.919 --> 01:24:03.287
All right. Yes.

01:24:13.530 --> 01:24:15.900
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:24:17.701 --> 01:24:18.736
I love you.

01:24:48.331 --> 01:24:50.867
You do realize that
I could be your mother?

01:24:52.102 --> 01:24:53.271
Almost.

01:24:56.607 --> 01:24:59.940
I'm gonna have to disagree
with you on that one.

01:24:59.942 --> 01:25:02.280
My mother's not the least
bit attractive to me.

01:25:11.088 --> 01:25:13.323
But seriously, how would
this work?

01:25:14.223 --> 01:25:16.393
Have you thought
this through?

01:25:22.198 --> 01:25:23.532
Yeah.

01:25:23.534 --> 01:25:25.737
That's all I think about.

01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:32.039
You have a whole, big,
new life in front of you.

01:25:32.041 --> 01:25:33.010
Years.

01:25:39.616 --> 01:25:41.886
How could you possibly know
that it's me that you want?

01:26:08.946 --> 01:26:12.617
I've been feeling
all this pressure...

01:26:16.853 --> 01:26:18.686
from myself mostly.

01:26:18.688 --> 01:26:19.656
But...

01:26:21.692 --> 01:26:22.760
From everybody.

01:26:25.295 --> 01:26:27.328
You know, to...

01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:29.633
do all these things,
you know.

01:26:31.701 --> 01:26:32.704
To...

01:26:33.269 --> 01:26:34.906
fulfill my potential.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.608
But...

01:26:42.946 --> 01:26:44.082
I just...

01:26:45.249 --> 01:26:47.050
I just want a simple life.

01:26:52.121 --> 01:26:53.423
I mean, I just...

01:26:54.657 --> 01:26:57.191
wanna have a job
I'm good at.

01:26:57.193 --> 01:26:58.959
You know,
come home every day

01:26:58.961 --> 01:27:02.532
to somebody that I love,
and be good to them.

01:27:04.367 --> 01:27:05.635
And, um...

01:27:06.570 --> 01:27:08.139
watch television.

01:27:09.772 --> 01:27:11.071
And, um...

01:27:11.073 --> 01:27:14.445
maybe go for a hike every now
and again on the weekends.

01:27:19.383 --> 01:27:22.687
I want you to be the
person I come home to,

01:27:23.987 --> 01:27:25.556
and spend my life with.

01:27:28.991 --> 01:27:33.096
'Cause I already love you more
than I thought was ever possible.

01:27:41.071 --> 01:27:42.837
...a Blue Bird.

01:27:42.839 --> 01:27:44.271
No, I never heard of it.

01:27:44.273 --> 01:27:47.042
No? Maybe it was called
the Red Bird.

01:27:47.044 --> 01:27:49.711
Or the Yellow Bird.
It was some kind of bird.

01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:54.684
But they have the best pancake and the best
French toast, and the best everything.

01:27:59.790 --> 01:28:00.892
Oh, my God.

01:28:01.825 --> 01:28:02.827
Oh, my God.

01:28:09.332 --> 01:28:10.465
Chris, you gotta
get out of here.

01:28:10.467 --> 01:28:11.967
I'm not going anywhere.

01:28:11.969 --> 01:28:12.970
Please.

01:28:15.238 --> 01:28:16.570
Tom...

01:28:16.572 --> 01:28:18.840
Tom, hold on.
Tom, hold on a second.

01:28:18.842 --> 01:28:20.574
Hold on, one second.
Please, Tom. Oh, my God!

01:28:20.576 --> 01:28:22.377
Stop!

01:28:22.379 --> 01:28:24.148
Jesus Christ. Tom!

01:28:25.147 --> 01:28:26.683
Oh, my God.
Tom?

01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:32.089
Chris, go. Right now.

01:28:35.157 --> 01:28:36.126
Get out of here.

01:29:57.340 --> 01:29:58.308
You hungry?

01:30:01.612 --> 01:30:02.980
Do you want me
to make you an omelette?

01:30:06.415 --> 01:30:07.651
It'll take two seconds.

01:30:10.586 --> 01:30:11.923
Yeah? Take a seat.

01:30:46.255 --> 01:30:47.357
Hey, um...

01:30:52.662 --> 01:30:55.165
I just wanna say
I'm sorry for being

01:30:56.098 --> 01:30:57.668
such a fucking asshole.

01:31:06.108 --> 01:31:08.678
I didn't...
I didn't know what to do.

01:31:10.246 --> 01:31:13.851
I mean, you went to prison, and
then, you didn't say anything.

01:31:15.552 --> 01:31:16.950
And I should've
visited you more.

01:31:16.952 --> 01:31:17.985
I should've
visited you way more.

01:31:17.987 --> 01:31:19.486
But I was afraid
if I went in there

01:31:19.488 --> 01:31:21.489
and I said something, someone
would fucking hear me

01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:23.792
and they could throw me in there.
It's stupid though.

01:31:23.794 --> 01:31:25.526
No excuses.
I should have been there.

01:31:25.528 --> 01:31:27.031
I should have been there
way fucking more.

01:31:35.138 --> 01:31:37.108
I feel like such
a fucking piece of shit.

01:31:43.847 --> 01:31:45.816
And there's nothing
I can do now, but, I...

01:31:49.219 --> 01:31:50.254
I'm sorry.

01:32:01.531 --> 01:32:02.800
You should take my truck.

01:32:06.737 --> 01:32:08.203
What do you mean?

01:32:08.205 --> 01:32:09.636
It's the only thing I have that's
worth anything. Just take my truck.

01:32:09.638 --> 01:32:11.041
Please take my fucking truck.

01:32:17.113 --> 01:32:18.782
I don't want your truck, man.

01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:22.717
I don't even drive
a stick shift.

01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:24.618
I'll drive you around.

01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:27.154
How about that?
I can just drive you around.

01:32:27.156 --> 01:32:29.125
I'll fucking drive you
for the rest of your life.

01:32:51.481 --> 01:32:52.416
Hey.

01:32:52.648 --> 01:32:54.047
Hi.

01:32:54.049 --> 01:32:57.217
Uh... I'm calling because,

01:32:57.219 --> 01:32:59.788
uh, Hildy was not
at school today.

01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:01.258
<i>She's not at work, and...</i>

01:33:03.093 --> 01:33:05.293
I don't know where she is,
and I'm starting to lose it,

01:33:05.295 --> 01:33:08.029
and I'm wondering if maybe
you've heard from her,

01:33:08.031 --> 01:33:09.967
or if you know anything
about where she is?

01:33:11.233 --> 01:33:12.102
<i>Um...</i>

01:33:12.936 --> 01:33:15.371
No, I don't know.
I'm sorry.

01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:17.475
Shit.

01:33:22.112 --> 01:33:23.781
Did you try the Jordan house?

01:33:25.381 --> 01:33:26.782
What's that?

01:33:26.784 --> 01:33:29.249
<i>You know, the one that's on
the way out to Lake Stevens.</i>

01:33:29.251 --> 01:33:31.052
<i>It's like burned out
or whatever.</i>

01:33:31.054 --> 01:33:32.356
<i>She might be over there.</i>

01:33:33.356 --> 01:33:34.358
Wow. Okay.

01:33:35.224 --> 01:33:36.291
All right.

01:33:36.293 --> 01:33:37.161
<i>Carol?</i>

01:33:38.094 --> 01:33:39.726
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Chris...</i>

01:33:39.728 --> 01:33:42.432
Chris, I can't do this, okay? I
can't do this right now. Okay?

01:33:44.267 --> 01:33:46.170
Yeah. No, of course.

01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:48.002
<i>Of course.</i>

01:33:48.004 --> 01:33:49.240
- All right. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:34:33.482 --> 01:34:34.418
Hi.

01:34:38.153 --> 01:34:39.122
Hi.

01:34:42.558 --> 01:34:45.361
So this is, uh, where you
been spending all your time?

01:34:49.398 --> 01:34:50.601
It's really beautiful.

01:34:58.340 --> 01:34:59.509
Hildy, honey, I'm...

01:35:00.477 --> 01:35:02.278
I'm so sorry that you, uh...

01:35:03.545 --> 01:35:04.848
Had to see that.

01:35:06.349 --> 01:35:09.784
I don't know why your father felt it
was so important to have you there.

01:35:09.786 --> 01:35:11.388
I'm the one who told him
where you were, Mom.

01:35:14.057 --> 01:35:15.860
Your credit card
company called.

01:35:18.027 --> 01:35:19.329
Suspicious activity.

01:35:30.473 --> 01:35:31.873
So...

01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:34.478
Are you guys, like, together?

01:35:35.879 --> 01:35:37.514
No, honey.
We're not together.

01:35:39.214 --> 01:35:42.119
That was the first
and only...

01:35:50.059 --> 01:35:53.927
When Chris was in jail,
we talked... a lot, and...

01:35:53.929 --> 01:35:57.498
I felt like I made
a difference in his life.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:00.271
You know? That I was
important to him.

01:36:03.572 --> 01:36:04.642
You were.

01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:08.646
He told me.

01:36:12.848 --> 01:36:15.218
Anyway, that's how
our connection started.

01:36:17.853 --> 01:36:19.188
And I thought when he...

01:36:20.022 --> 01:36:21.491
got out of jail, it would...

01:36:22.525 --> 01:36:25.028
you know, be different.
That it would dissipate.

01:36:27.731 --> 01:36:28.933
Well...

01:36:34.504 --> 01:36:35.539
So...

01:36:37.639 --> 01:36:39.108
what about you and Dad?

01:36:42.579 --> 01:36:45.215
Honey, I don't know what's
gonna happen with me and Dad.

01:36:51.588 --> 01:36:53.256
But I need you to know...

01:36:55.491 --> 01:36:58.494
that you are the most important
thing in the world to me.

01:37:03.265 --> 01:37:05.365
And it just kills me that I
hadn't been there for you

01:37:05.367 --> 01:37:06.602
the way
that I should have been.

01:37:16.278 --> 01:37:19.249
I'm hoping you'll give me
a chance to try to fix it.

01:37:27.689 --> 01:37:30.160
I can't believe you did
all that work in there.

01:37:31.628 --> 01:37:33.327
I'm...

01:37:33.329 --> 01:37:34.928
I mean, I can believe
you did it.

01:37:34.930 --> 01:37:37.300
I just can't believe that I
didn't know anything about it.

01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:29.810
All right.
Here are your fries.

01:39:29.812 --> 01:39:31.180
- Thanks.
- Bye.

01:40:01.844 --> 01:40:02.909
You do it?

01:40:02.911 --> 01:40:04.311
No.

01:40:04.313 --> 01:40:05.779
Then why are you smiling?

01:40:05.781 --> 01:40:07.080
- I'm not.
- Did you do it?

01:40:07.082 --> 01:40:08.716
- I'm not.
- Chris, did you fucking do it?

01:40:08.718 --> 01:40:11.084
I did not do it.
I'm just... I'm...

01:40:11.086 --> 01:40:12.388
It's kinda cool.

01:40:13.522 --> 01:40:16.356
Yes. Uh, in the middle
of my living room

01:40:16.358 --> 01:40:18.794
there's a series of chairs
stacked up on each other.

01:40:20.295 --> 01:40:21.962
It's together...

01:40:21.964 --> 01:40:23.534
They put it together with some sort
of tape or something like that.

01:40:34.244 --> 01:40:35.478
Hi.

01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:49.893
Hi.

01:40:51.561 --> 01:40:53.197
I'm sorry to bug you
at work.

01:40:53.795 --> 01:40:54.729
Is this a bad time?

01:40:54.731 --> 01:40:57.233
No, it's okay.
I'm due for a break.

01:41:02.472 --> 01:41:03.473
Um...

01:41:05.107 --> 01:41:06.342
How are you?

01:41:07.043 --> 01:41:08.778
I'm good. Um...

01:41:10.513 --> 01:41:11.412
Got a job.

01:41:11.414 --> 01:41:12.715
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

01:41:14.951 --> 01:41:16.449
It smells nice in here.

01:41:16.451 --> 01:41:19.153
- Yeah, it's Timothy hay.
- Mm.

01:41:19.155 --> 01:41:20.691
It's, um, it's the sweetest.

01:41:25.027 --> 01:41:27.093
Um, how are you doing?

01:41:27.095 --> 01:41:28.729
How is everybody?

01:41:28.731 --> 01:41:30.597
Uh... Good.

01:41:30.599 --> 01:41:32.300
You know, uh...

01:41:32.302 --> 01:41:34.470
Hildy's talking to me,
which is nice.

01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:35.973
That's good.

01:41:39.875 --> 01:41:41.244
Tom moved out.

01:41:44.847 --> 01:41:45.916
I'm sorry.

01:41:57.226 --> 01:41:59.327
So I've been
thinking about you, um,

01:41:59.329 --> 01:42:01.697
a bit over
the last few weeks.

01:42:04.834 --> 01:42:05.969
I hear what you say about

01:42:07.036 --> 01:42:08.472
wanting a simple life.

01:42:09.405 --> 01:42:11.041
I get it.
I understand that.

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:12.909
Completely.

01:42:14.544 --> 01:42:16.177
But, um,

01:42:16.179 --> 01:42:17.648
that's what I've had.

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.348
You know?

01:42:20.015 --> 01:42:21.349
You go to work,
you come home,

01:42:21.351 --> 01:42:23.286
you have dinner,
you watch TV, you know...

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:26.656
I feel like I'm just
getting started.

01:42:29.392 --> 01:42:30.594
I want more.

01:42:38.867 --> 01:42:41.972
I loved the work that I did
to help you get out.

01:42:44.639 --> 01:42:47.041
It felt important.
It felt like it mattered.

01:42:47.043 --> 01:42:49.379
I felt like I was good at it.

01:42:52.415 --> 01:42:53.950
I wanna do more of that.

01:42:55.451 --> 01:42:57.717
Like I was...
I was thinking

01:42:57.719 --> 01:43:00.120
when Hildy goes off
to college next year,

01:43:00.122 --> 01:43:02.021
maybe I'll even
move to Seattle,

01:43:02.023 --> 01:43:04.428
be closer to the offices
there and the work.

01:43:05.695 --> 01:43:08.095
Why not, you know?
I'm...

01:43:08.097 --> 01:43:09.398
I'm totally free now.

01:43:15.204 --> 01:43:16.439
Wow.

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:21.344
I can see why
that can be so...

01:43:23.478 --> 01:43:24.981
great for you.

01:43:43.732 --> 01:43:44.834
I wonder, um,

01:43:45.835 --> 01:43:48.004
would you wanna
have lunch sometime?

01:43:53.608 --> 01:43:56.079
Maybe see if we can
try to get to know each other...

01:43:58.447 --> 01:43:59.816
as we are now?

01:44:13.161 --> 01:44:14.164
Yeah.

01:44:15.697 --> 01:44:16.700
Of course.
