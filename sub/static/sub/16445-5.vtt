<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:02.620 --> 00:03.977
Who are those people
you were speaking with?

00:04.026 --> 00:05.319
You keep your nose out of my business.

00:05.367 --> 00:06.733
Now, now, Butch, play nice.

00:06.769 --> 00:08.355
<i>If a person comes
into contact with my blood,</i>

00:08.387 --> 00:09.620
it changes them.

00:09.655 --> 00:11.055
<i>My brother... he gets</i>

00:11.090 --> 00:12.089
<i>in your mind, you're doomed.</i>

00:12.125 --> 00:14.091
Good-bye, Mr. Gordon.

00:15.088 --> 00:17.085
- Ivy's missing.
- She'll turn up somewhere.

00:17.117 --> 00:18.283
This time she fell.

00:18.319 --> 00:20.352
<i>It was a long way down into water.</i>

00:20.387 --> 00:21.787
<i>Maybe she survived.</i>

00:21.822 --> 00:23.322
- What's your name?
- My name's Ivy.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.756
Barnes asked me to put you on

00:24.792 --> 00:26.959
a 48-hour suicide watch. I've
already signed off on it.

00:26.994 --> 00:28.994
- He just cost you the election!
- Give me one reason

00:29.029 --> 00:31.296
why I shouldn't let Butch
kill you where you stand.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.363
- Oswald Cobblepot
- There's that.

00:32.399 --> 00:33.799
Has won the mayor's office.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.534
I believe in you, Oswald.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.202
You never believed

00:37.238 --> 00:38.504
I could win this election on my own.

00:38.539 --> 00:39.793
Maybe you're not cut
out for this, after all.

00:39.818 --> 00:40.840
What?!

00:40.904 --> 00:42.941
- Jervis. Let her go now.
- No!

00:42.977 --> 00:43.942
I'll never go with you!

00:43.978 --> 00:46.378
- No!

00:48.482 --> 00:50.481
You killed her!

00:58.839 --> 01:00.359
I would like to introduce you

01:00.394 --> 01:02.027
to my chief of staff,

01:02.062 --> 01:04.029
Mr. Edward Nygma.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.236
Welcome your new mayor
of Gotham.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.572
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.340
He'll make Gotham safe again.

01:15.376 --> 01:18.243
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.046
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.514
He'll make Gotham safe again.

01:24.723 --> 01:27.119
Welcome your new mayor of Gotham.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.521
Mayor Oswald Cobblepot.

01:43.697 --> 01:45.307
Thank you so much, thank you.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.893
<i>There's something
I've been wanting to ask you.</i>

02:08.929 --> 02:10.929
Am I a good boy?

02:10.965 --> 02:12.864
Have I made you proud?

02:17.780 --> 02:19.671
I hope I'm not interrupting.

02:19.707 --> 02:23.475
Oh, Ed, you never met my mother.

02:24.166 --> 02:25.577
Wasn't she beautiful?

02:28.048 --> 02:29.826
A fine figure of a woman.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.719
She was my whole world.

02:33.754 --> 02:37.189
The only one that was
always there for me.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.958
Well, I believe the answer is yes.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.557
She would be proud.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.797
Do you really think so?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.567
Oswald, look at everything
you've achieved.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.802
The people love you.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.571
Gangs fear you.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.040
And tomorrow night, the crÃƒÂ¨me of Gotham

02:55.075 --> 02:58.410
will be gathering to celebrate you.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.748
What more could someone ask for?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.423
Someone to share it with.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.765
My mother was the
daughter of immigrants.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.233
A humble cook.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.668
We did not have much,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.637
but when she was by
my side, I felt loved.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.305
Protected.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.642
As promised, I have rid Gotham
of its villainous monsters.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.079
With my mother as my witness,

03:34.114 --> 03:36.548
I vow to you from this day forward,

03:36.583 --> 03:38.083
every man, woman,

03:38.118 --> 03:40.419
and child in our great city

03:40.454 --> 03:42.287
will be safe!

03:50.064 --> 03:52.330
No one is safe. Not from us.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.199
Drop it.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.300
Put it down.

04:15.355 --> 04:17.622
You will pay for this!

04:17.658 --> 04:18.890
Dearly!

04:18.926 --> 04:20.791
Now, now, Mr. Mayor.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.294
Don't go losing your head.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.830
Have a nice day.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.377
I can't come over tonight.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.146
Okay.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.415
I mean, that'd be three nights in a row.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.416
That'd almost make it a thing.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.585
The neighbors might talk.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.165
Exactly. And I have a dinner.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.523
It's not a date.

04:51.558 --> 04:54.159
None of my business.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.695
Uh-huh.

04:56.730 --> 05:01.366
So... whatever happened with Tetch?

05:01.401 --> 05:03.034
I told you.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.370
He broke his sister out of the GCPD.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.538
Bullock and I chased him down.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.073
She died. He escaped.

05:08.108 --> 05:09.341
'Cause I heard a rumor

05:09.376 --> 05:11.512
there's something
strange about her blood.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.016
Do you like this?

05:18.051 --> 05:19.818
I think I made that pretty clear.

05:19.853 --> 05:20.719
Then why are you pressing?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.020
Because I want to know.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.989
Are you asking as a
reporter or as yourself?

05:24.024 --> 05:25.023
Is there a difference?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.925
There should be. When you were a cop,

05:26.960 --> 05:29.110
did you stop being one
when you came home?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.832
Maybe that was my problem.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.434
Hmm.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.503
The guy I'm having dinner
with is the hematologist

05:38.539 --> 05:41.740
in charge of analyzing
Alice Tetch's blood.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.843
I'm free after 10:00
if you want to call.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.479
Thanks for the coffee.

05:58.425 --> 05:59.758
We found the truck.

06:03.330 --> 06:04.462
They ditched it in the Narrows.

06:04.498 --> 06:05.864
We got forensics going over it

06:05.899 --> 06:08.366
and teams doing a ten-block sweep.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.302
We already found this.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.536
The Red Hood Gang.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.004
I thought those idiots were dead.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.406
My guess is they're copying the look.

06:14.441 --> 06:17.175
The original Red Hood
Gang were bank robbers.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.277
Whoever they are, they
got a beef with Penguin.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.613
Expand the search to 15 blocks.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.848
Everything goes through you.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.049
You mean through me.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.089
Wow.

06:35.762 --> 06:38.730
It is good to be back.

06:38.765 --> 06:42.067
I have missed all of you.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.170
Harvey.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.995
Still a stranger to a
haircut and a shave, I see.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.741
What are you doing here, Nygma?

06:49.776 --> 06:51.576
As Mayor Cobblepot's chief of staff,

06:51.612 --> 06:53.345
I'm gonna be your liaison on
the Red Hood investigation.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.647
I want to see all reports.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.549
I'm gonna need access
to your forensic lab.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.218
You think I'm gonna just let
you waltz into my precinct?

07:01.588 --> 07:02.654
You're a cop killer who should be

07:02.689 --> 07:03.655
in the loony bin.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.658
- I'll be damned...
- You'll be fired.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.194
The mayor can't fire me.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.529
No, but he can appoint

07:11.565 --> 07:13.298
a police commissioner who will.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.468
So... you will carry out

07:16.503 --> 07:18.503
the mayor's orders without question

07:18.538 --> 07:20.105
or the GCPD has a new captain.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.239
How does that sound?

07:23.377 --> 07:25.819
Every dog has his day, Nygma.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.380
Enjoy yours.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.586
And where is our lord mayor?

07:34.621 --> 07:36.388
Hiding under his desk?

07:37.418 --> 07:39.858
He's meeting with constituents.

07:42.296 --> 07:46.164
"Anything for you, my
little Cobble Pot."

07:47.567 --> 07:49.801
"You can count on me."

07:52.973 --> 07:55.040
Those were the words my
mother used to whisper to me

07:55.075 --> 07:57.375
every night before I fell asleep.

07:57.411 --> 07:58.944
She was a saint.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.679
Yes.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.981
A saint whose only desire was

08:03.016 --> 08:05.283
to love me.

08:05.319 --> 08:07.352
And what was her thanks?

08:07.387 --> 08:10.922
Not only did she take
a knife in the back...

08:10.958 --> 08:15.160
but even in her death, her
memory is being desecrated.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.195
Seriously?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.897
This is the reason we're here?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.432
A little glue.

08:20.467 --> 08:21.533
Some paint.

08:21.568 --> 08:22.634
Mama will be good as new, eh?

08:24.037 --> 08:25.570
No!

08:25.605 --> 08:28.868
That is not the reason you are here.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.943
The Red Hoods have
challenged my authority.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.178
They will be made an example of.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.913
Tonight,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.847
I am celebrating my historic victory...

08:36.883 --> 08:38.750
At the Sirens.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.552
It's gonna be fabulous.

08:40.587 --> 08:42.287
None of you are invited.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.358
I want them found and
their leader's head

08:46.393 --> 08:49.027
brought to me on a
spike before nightfall.

08:50.897 --> 08:52.497
What are you waiting for?!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.199
Find them!

08:57.137 --> 09:00.138
All right, five-card draw, gentlemen.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.507
All right, someone didn't ante up.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.976
Come on, you cheap bastards.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.048
How long are we supposed to wait?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.217
Long as it takes the
boss man to get here.

09:12.252 --> 09:13.218
You need a lookout.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.056
Uh, relax, fellas.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.125
Hey, uh, you want us
to deal you in, boss?

09:20.160 --> 09:23.695
We don't have time for games, boys.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.730
We got work to do.

09:35.369 --> 09:37.069
Hello, Jim.

09:37.104 --> 09:39.205
Is it a bad time? I should've called.

09:39.240 --> 09:42.007
No.

09:43.010 --> 09:44.710
Please, come in.

09:50.985 --> 09:53.085
Can I get you something to drink?

09:53.120 --> 09:56.155
- A... glass of water?
- I'm fine.

09:56.190 --> 09:57.456
I heard you were back.

09:57.492 --> 09:59.959
I've been meaning to come see you.

09:59.994 --> 10:02.194
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

10:02.230 --> 10:03.462
Alfred and I are both well.

10:05.309 --> 10:08.033
I hear you're a private
investigator now.

10:08.069 --> 10:09.502
I'd like to hire you.

10:09.537 --> 10:11.604
Uh, Bruce, if this is about corruption

10:11.639 --> 10:13.339
at Wayne Enterprises... It's not.

10:13.374 --> 10:16.668
I've put my investigation into
my father's company aside.

10:17.044 --> 10:18.344
It's time I moved on.

10:18.379 --> 10:19.778
Why the sudden change of heart?

10:19.814 --> 10:21.146
It's far from sudden.

10:21.182 --> 10:23.282
I've given it a great deal of thought.

10:23.317 --> 10:26.085
I can't live my life
if I keep looking back.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.755
For what it's worth,
I think that's wise.

10:29.790 --> 10:31.090
So, what can I do for you?

10:31.125 --> 10:33.025
Ivy Pepper's gone missing.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.327
I didn't realize you two were close.

10:35.363 --> 10:37.863
We're not, she's a friend of Selina's.

10:37.899 --> 10:40.268
And does Selina know you're doing this?

10:40.306 --> 10:41.300
No.

10:41.335 --> 10:43.669
I don't want to get her hopes
up if we don't find anything.

10:46.073 --> 10:48.807
Well, we'll start with the GCPD.

10:48.843 --> 10:50.609
See where we go from there.

10:50.645 --> 10:53.979
I think it's chivalrous,
you doing this for Selina.

10:54.015 --> 10:55.414
How long have you two been a thing?

10:55.449 --> 10:57.349
Oh, no, no, no.

10:57.385 --> 10:59.818
- Selina's a friend, that's all.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

10:59.854 --> 11:01.053
No, really, she's just a friend.

11:01.088 --> 11:04.056
Yeah, yeah.

11:04.091 --> 11:06.358
Mr. Fox,

11:06.394 --> 11:07.660
just the man I've been wanting to see.

11:07.695 --> 11:10.362
Oh, joy. Mr. Nygma.

11:10.398 --> 11:11.730
Heard you were stopping by.

11:11.766 --> 11:14.166
I have questions.

11:14.201 --> 11:16.368
- Hopefully, you have answers.
- Or what?

11:16.404 --> 11:17.736
You'll poison me with gas?

11:18.839 --> 11:20.906
That gas was a sleeping agent.

11:20.942 --> 11:24.176
And to be fair, I was not in
the best place in my life.

11:25.279 --> 11:28.113
To be fair,

11:28.149 --> 11:29.381
if you ever threaten my life

11:29.417 --> 11:31.684
or the life of Bruce Wayne again,

11:31.719 --> 11:33.252
I will find a way to end you.

11:33.287 --> 11:35.654
Mr. Fox, we both know you're
not a man of violence.

11:35.690 --> 11:36.922
No, I am not.

11:36.958 --> 11:40.159
If I was, I would've laced
some piece of lab equipment,

11:40.194 --> 11:43.262
one which you were sure
to touch, with a toxin.

11:43.297 --> 11:44.563
Ricin, maybe.

11:44.599 --> 11:46.932
I'd use Saxitoxin. Harder to trace.

11:46.968 --> 11:48.767
But I like your style.

11:48.803 --> 11:50.069
You are insane.

11:50.104 --> 11:51.437
Was insane.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.070
I have a certificate.

11:53.808 --> 11:56.575
- So, the Red Hoods?
- See for yourself.

12:05.019 --> 12:08.120
The gang's getaway vehicle
was abandoned in the Narrows.

12:08.155 --> 12:09.254
As you'll notice,

12:09.290 --> 12:13.225
its carpet fibers has
elements of dirt, oil,

12:13.260 --> 12:15.661
and, oddly, potassium chloride.

12:16.697 --> 12:18.897
A halide salt.

12:20.201 --> 12:22.901
Fascinating.

12:22.937 --> 12:24.169
<i>So nothing on Ivy Pepper,</i>

12:24.205 --> 12:27.172
but an odd report came
in a few weeks ago, okay?

12:27.208 --> 12:29.141
A construction worker claimed

12:29.176 --> 12:32.378
that a redhead knocked
him out, robbed him,

12:32.413 --> 12:33.979
and she left this.

12:34.015 --> 12:35.981
That's Ivy's sweater.

12:36.017 --> 12:37.483
How do we find this man?

12:37.518 --> 12:39.385
I already called, all
right? The guy's down south

12:39.420 --> 12:41.320
on a job, but he swore up and down

12:41.355 --> 12:42.454
that the redhead who rolled him...

12:42.490 --> 12:45.124
- was in her 20s.
- So?

12:45.159 --> 12:47.159
He's probably covering for
being with a young girl.

12:47.194 --> 12:50.195
Doubtful he would come
forward in the first place.

12:50.231 --> 12:52.297
Yeah, most pervs don't want to
call attention to themselves.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.533
So it wasn't Ivy.

12:54.568 --> 12:56.402
It seems unlikely, but why
would she have Ivy's sweater?

12:56.437 --> 12:58.170
- Dr. Thompkins.

12:58.205 --> 13:00.339
Bruce, it's good to see you again.

13:00.374 --> 13:01.473
You got taller.

13:01.509 --> 13:04.043
Like I said, right? The
kid's growing like a weed.

13:04.078 --> 13:05.511
Nice to see you, too.

13:05.546 --> 13:08.247
Uh, Jim, could I have a word?

13:10.351 --> 13:12.584
Wanted you to hear it from me, um,

13:12.620 --> 13:14.353
my engagement announcement is coming out

13:14.388 --> 13:15.487
in <i> The Gazette</i> tomorrow.

13:15.523 --> 13:18.424
And it will feature Mario's name.

13:20.194 --> 13:21.560
I think that's customary.

13:21.595 --> 13:23.696
His family name.

13:23.731 --> 13:24.763
You mean Falcone.

13:24.799 --> 13:26.598
You knew?

13:27.404 --> 13:28.600
You knew and you didn't say anything?

13:28.636 --> 13:29.601
Sure I did.

13:29.637 --> 13:30.903
I said congratulations.

13:30.938 --> 13:32.938
- Don't be cute.
- Lee.

13:32.973 --> 13:35.040
People talk.

13:35.076 --> 13:37.710
Was I surprised? Sure.

13:37.745 --> 13:39.111
But it's also none of my business.

13:39.146 --> 13:41.046
Your life is your life.

13:41.082 --> 13:42.881
And I meant what I said.

13:42.917 --> 13:44.450
Very happy for you.

13:45.906 --> 13:47.519
So, that's it?

13:47.555 --> 13:50.122
That's it.

13:52.993 --> 13:56.929
Okay, um, well, I just...
wanted to tell you.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.508
Dr. Thompkins.

14:11.846 --> 14:14.279
I had heard that you were back.

14:14.315 --> 14:15.894
I'm so glad...

14:19.687 --> 14:20.953
That's for Kristen.

14:20.988 --> 14:22.988
You shouldn't have done that. Or what?

14:23.023 --> 14:25.290
I'm supposed to be scared of you
because you work for Penguin?

14:25.326 --> 14:28.761
My fiancÃ©'s father is Carmine Falcone.

14:28.796 --> 14:30.629
I so much as whisper to him,

14:30.664 --> 14:33.132
and you disappear.

14:34.935 --> 14:37.603
Tell the mayor, whatever I can
do as M.E., I'm happy to help.

14:44.779 --> 14:47.146
It's bad enough we're
throwing Penguin's party.

14:47.181 --> 14:48.313
It's good for the club.

14:48.349 --> 14:49.982
Now we're his errand girls?

14:50.017 --> 14:53.051
Sweetie, we find the
Red Hoods, he'll owe us.

14:53.087 --> 14:55.487
We can ask for a favor,
say him not killing you?

14:55.523 --> 14:57.322
Well, it would be nice not
to have to watch my ass

14:57.358 --> 14:59.358
all the time.

15:02.196 --> 15:03.529
Well, well.

15:03.564 --> 15:05.197
Who do we have here?

15:05.232 --> 15:07.299
Guy calls himself the Ballistic Bomber.

15:07.334 --> 15:09.668
My contact at the Merc saw him buying

15:09.703 --> 15:11.236
- smoke grenades last week.
- Ooh.

15:11.272 --> 15:13.605
Just like the ones the
Red Hoods used on Penguin.

15:13.641 --> 15:15.240
Groovy.

15:15.276 --> 15:16.275
Reckon he'll talk?

15:16.310 --> 15:18.544
Of course.

15:18.579 --> 15:20.646
No!

15:20.681 --> 15:22.414
Maybe give him a moment.

15:22.449 --> 15:23.649
<i>Now remember, kids,</i>

15:23.684 --> 15:26.318
you tell the press this
is all Penguin's fault.

15:28.189 --> 15:30.656
- Good.
- Yes, sir.

15:30.691 --> 15:31.957
- Light it up.

15:31.992 --> 15:34.693
- Oh, mercy.
- Please. No, no.

15:34.728 --> 15:36.528
Better run, Sister,

15:36.564 --> 15:37.529
'fore the Padre goes boom.

15:37.565 --> 15:39.531
Lord Jesus!

15:39.567 --> 15:41.300
Don't!

15:41.335 --> 15:43.869
Wait, wait! The grenade is slipping!

15:46.707 --> 15:48.640
Seriously, a priest?

15:48.676 --> 15:50.275
You should've seen it.

15:50.311 --> 15:51.577
Ka-boom!

15:51.612 --> 15:53.545
But you told 'em what to say?

15:53.581 --> 15:56.215
- This is all because of Penguin?
- Yeah, boss, but I don't get it.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.750
You want to take out
Penguin, let's take him out.

15:58.786 --> 16:00.219
This Red Hood stuff is fun,

16:00.254 --> 16:01.420
but it's a lot of work.

16:01.455 --> 16:02.721
How about you just do what I tell you?

16:04.458 --> 16:08.527
Now, I got you these

16:08.562 --> 16:11.563
so you'll blend in at the party tonight.

16:11.599 --> 16:12.631
- Huh? Huh?

16:12.666 --> 16:15.000
Nice suit.

16:15.035 --> 16:17.569
And that's when we kill him?

16:17.605 --> 16:18.704
No!

16:18.739 --> 16:20.706
No one kills Penguin.

16:20.741 --> 16:21.707
You should.

16:21.742 --> 16:23.909
'Cause he's going to murder you.

16:28.315 --> 16:30.282
Time to have a heart-to-heart, Butch.

16:30.317 --> 16:32.651
Alone.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.366
You don't have to buy lunch.

16:43.402 --> 16:46.369
I know you're a billionaire,
but I can buy you a sandwich.

16:47.406 --> 16:49.506
Do you miss it?

16:49.541 --> 16:51.007
Being a cop?

16:51.043 --> 16:52.609
Sometimes, yeah.

16:52.644 --> 16:55.278
Gave a sense of mission.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.446
True.

16:56.481 --> 16:58.799
There's more to life
than having a mission.

17:01.286 --> 17:05.155
Look, I'll keep asking
around about Ivy, but, uh...

17:05.190 --> 17:07.691
you want my advice,

17:07.726 --> 17:09.226
talk to Selina.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.462
Tell her how you feel.

17:14.766 --> 17:17.534
Does that actually work?

17:17.569 --> 17:18.734
Sometimes.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.904
It's definitely better
than being silent.

17:20.939 --> 17:23.138
Before you know it, the moment passes.

17:24.267 --> 17:26.675
And are you taking your own advice?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.244
Afraid that ship has sailed.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.512
I'm not talking about Dr. Thompkins,

17:29.548 --> 17:30.981
I'm talking about the
woman you're seeing now.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.315
Excuse me?

17:32.351 --> 17:34.818
There was lipstick on a
coffee mug on your table.

17:34.853 --> 17:37.520
You've become quite the detective.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.357
So, are you?

17:40.392 --> 17:43.226
It's complicated.

17:43.262 --> 17:46.596
- So is Selina.
- That I believe.

17:50.006 --> 17:52.469
I just wish sometimes...

17:52.504 --> 17:54.571
I had a sign.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.539
Unfortunately, life doesn't
usually work that way.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.707
We're hours away

17:57.743 --> 18:00.877
from Mayor Cobblepot's
victory celebration.

18:00.912 --> 18:02.946
But people are asking,
will the Red Hood Gang

18:02.981 --> 18:04.614
put a damper on the festivities?

18:04.650 --> 18:07.117
Sounds like Penguin's having a bad day.

18:07.152 --> 18:09.519
I'm supposed to go to his party tonight.

18:09.554 --> 18:11.388
Part of my re-engagement
with being a Wayne.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.856
Mm.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.767
Well, give the mayor my best.

18:14.818 --> 18:18.194
Witnesses say the Red Hoods
blamed Cobblepot for their ac...

18:23.651 --> 18:25.468
Someone is testing me, Ed.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.337
They're thinking, "Oh, he's mayor now.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.938
He has to play by different rules."

18:28.974 --> 18:31.141
No, they'll see,

18:31.176 --> 18:33.276
when I'm roasting their
entrails over a fire.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.745
Perhaps I'm thinking
about this all wrong.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.380
Perhaps this is not about you at all.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.582
What if this is about the statue?

18:39.618 --> 18:40.950
Of course it's about me!

18:40.986 --> 18:42.285
Yes, you're probably right. Oh, dear.

18:43.488 --> 18:45.288
- Wonderful.
- Oswald.

18:45.324 --> 18:46.356
Take a breath.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.827
What are you doing?

18:50.862 --> 18:52.662
It's an old trick I learned in the lab.

18:52.698 --> 18:54.785
Most solvents have as their base...

18:57.102 --> 18:58.968
I am the son of water,

18:59.004 --> 19:00.437
but if water touches me, I die.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.072
- What am I?
- Again with the riddles.

19:02.107 --> 19:03.940
Salt. Most people think
of it as a food additive,

19:03.975 --> 19:06.509
but potassium salt is
found in detergents,

19:06.545 --> 19:09.446
- soaps...
- What is your point, Ed?

19:09.481 --> 19:12.315
I know where the Red Hoods are.

19:12.351 --> 19:14.918
I say we give him to Penguin.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.120
Knowing Penguin
will gut him like a fish.

19:17.155 --> 19:18.755
Ladies, come on.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.591
- After all we've been through...
- It's his life for yours.

19:21.626 --> 19:22.826
Simple.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.095
I don't get it.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.596
Why'd you turn on him now?

19:26.631 --> 19:27.997
I wasn't gonna hurt Penguin.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.033
Honest.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.001
I was gonna take down
the Red Hoods myself.

19:32.037 --> 19:34.334
Tonight. At the party.

19:34.360 --> 19:36.172
All this so you could play the hero?

19:37.676 --> 19:39.642
Ever since Nygma got out of Arkham,

19:39.678 --> 19:41.644
Penguin treats me like I'm nothing.

19:41.680 --> 19:44.447
That pencil-neck's
trying to push me out.

19:44.483 --> 19:46.216
Let me ask you, we
figured out you're the man

19:46.251 --> 19:48.017
behind the Red Hoods, how
long do you think it'll take

19:48.053 --> 19:49.053
Penguin and his lap dog?

19:50.589 --> 19:52.756
It's your life, baby.

19:52.791 --> 19:55.592
You make the call.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.530
Let me see this through.

20:00.565 --> 20:02.866
I get my place beside Penguin back,

20:02.901 --> 20:04.734
I'll protect you.

20:06.838 --> 20:08.905
Oh, you'll do more than that.

20:08.940 --> 20:10.350
You'll owe me.

20:11.129 --> 20:13.810
And one day, I'm gonna collect.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.380
Gilzean.

20:17.416 --> 20:18.882
Butch, where are you?

20:18.917 --> 20:20.350
The Red Hood Gang is
at a detergent factory

20:20.385 --> 20:23.086
in the Narrows. We're on our way.

20:23.121 --> 20:24.454
I got to go.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.691
Get your things.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.693
We're done. I'm breaking up the band.

20:31.771 --> 20:34.164
I'm serious, go! Get out of Dodge.

20:34.199 --> 20:36.756
Yeah, well, not for nothing,
but you promised us a payday.

20:37.510 --> 20:39.502
We're not leaving till we get it.

20:53.051 --> 20:55.952
Well, I guess it was gonna
happen sooner or later.

20:55.987 --> 20:57.657
What?

21:00.091 --> 21:01.791
Sorry, boys.

21:17.075 --> 21:18.241
I did it, boss.

21:18.276 --> 21:20.510
I got 'em for you.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.579
Peace and order have
once again been restored

21:33.624 --> 21:35.171
to Gotham.

21:35.222 --> 21:37.060
The Red Hood Gang is no more.

21:38.697 --> 21:41.971
My very own man, Butch Gilzean,

21:41.997 --> 21:45.465
risked life and limb to
face down the bandits.

21:46.868 --> 21:49.736
Was your life ever in danger, Butch?

21:49.771 --> 21:52.539
I can honestly say that
if I'd have hesitated,

21:52.574 --> 21:54.340
I'd have been a goner.

22:03.051 --> 22:04.884
All right, people, listen up!

22:04.920 --> 22:07.053
It's happy hour...
Finish up those reports

22:07.088 --> 22:08.969
and let's call it a day!

22:14.529 --> 22:18.197
Hey, uh... Ed.

22:18.233 --> 22:20.166
Even before you went crazy,

22:20.201 --> 22:21.234
I never liked you.

22:21.269 --> 22:22.302
Your zipper's down.

22:24.539 --> 22:26.539
Listen, Butch did us all a favor.

22:26.575 --> 22:28.808
Red Hoods go bye-bye, case closed.

22:28.843 --> 22:30.610
Look at the way the bodies fell.

22:30.645 --> 22:32.879
It's as if they were just standing
there, waiting to be killed.

22:32.914 --> 22:34.380
Butch comes all the way in the room,

22:34.416 --> 22:36.349
but only one man pulled out a gun.

22:36.384 --> 22:37.750
I guess they weren't threatened.

22:37.786 --> 22:40.286
By a 300-pound gorilla?

22:40.322 --> 22:42.889
Whose side are you on, anyway, hmm?

22:42.924 --> 22:45.892
No one's losing sleep over
a bunch of dead crooks,

22:45.927 --> 22:48.428
least of all me.

22:48.463 --> 22:50.129
I said wrap it up!

22:56.571 --> 22:58.838
What have we here?

23:12.354 --> 23:13.786
Burning the midnight oil?

23:13.822 --> 23:16.589
I was just finishing up.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.891
I'm guessing you're
here to reprimand me.

23:18.927 --> 23:22.061
Reprimand you? For what?

23:22.097 --> 23:23.997
Punching Nygma in the jaw.

23:24.833 --> 23:26.099
I just couldn't help myself.

23:26.134 --> 23:27.667
First I'm hearing of it.

23:28.970 --> 23:30.837
Well done, Doctor.

23:32.307 --> 23:35.742
Actually, I'm here to ask about, uh...

23:35.777 --> 23:38.077
Alice Tetch's blood, if
you've heard anything.

23:38.113 --> 23:39.946
As it happens, I just received

23:39.981 --> 23:42.115
the preliminary results
back from the lab.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.951
- Fascinating.
- What is?

23:44.986 --> 23:47.487
They injected samples
into a group of rats.

23:47.522 --> 23:49.122
After three days, two of the rats

23:49.157 --> 23:51.924
were showing marked increases
in strength and stamina.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.926
Oh? That doesn't sound so bad.

23:53.962 --> 23:56.529
But the study ended after one of
the rats killed all the others.

23:57.732 --> 23:59.032
I'm guessing that's not normal.

23:59.067 --> 24:01.267
It chewed through a dozen wire cages

24:01.302 --> 24:03.536
to get at them... no.

24:06.741 --> 24:08.941
Well, why would one
of the rats go psycho

24:08.977 --> 24:10.309
and not the others?

24:10.345 --> 24:11.778
Perhaps the others hadn't had a chance

24:11.813 --> 24:14.347
to show any symptoms,
or they were immune.

24:14.382 --> 24:16.616
Some people live with
a disease for years

24:16.651 --> 24:18.818
without having any adverse effects.

24:18.853 --> 24:21.054
The lab is starting a new study now.

24:21.089 --> 24:24.490
Well, keep me informed.

24:26.061 --> 24:29.462
Oh, and, uh... don't stay too late.

24:29.497 --> 24:31.030
I'm sure that fiancÃ© of yours

24:31.066 --> 24:32.899
would like to see you once in a while.

24:32.934 --> 24:35.068
And was the captain of the GCPD invited

24:35.103 --> 24:37.503
to our new mayor's victory party?

24:37.539 --> 24:40.039
You know, I lost my invitation.

24:46.614 --> 24:48.026
I can feel it.

25:01.963 --> 25:03.496
Heard you took down the Red Hood Gang

25:03.531 --> 25:05.598
single-handed.

25:05.633 --> 25:07.033
So to speak.

25:07.068 --> 25:08.735
- Very funny.
- Don't forget,

25:08.770 --> 25:10.603
you owe me.

25:16.544 --> 25:17.744
I know.

25:21.116 --> 25:22.448
How long do we have to stay?

25:22.484 --> 25:23.850
As long as it takes for you to be seen

25:23.885 --> 25:25.852
in the world, Master Bruce...

25:25.887 --> 25:27.920
being Bruce Wayne.

25:27.956 --> 25:29.789
And smiling.

25:31.326 --> 25:33.092
So this is our life now?

25:33.128 --> 25:35.762
Fake smiles and mingling.

25:35.797 --> 25:37.630
I miss the old days.

25:37.665 --> 25:39.966
- So do I.

25:44.572 --> 25:46.205
- So nice.
- Oh, excuse me.

25:46.241 --> 25:47.406
Yes.

25:47.442 --> 25:49.375
Bruce, Mr. Pennyworth,

25:49.410 --> 25:51.077
I'm so pleased you made it.

25:51.112 --> 25:52.078
Yeah, well, you know, we're trying to

25:52.113 --> 25:53.746
get out a bit more, Mr. Mayor.

25:53.782 --> 25:55.782
Oswald, please.

25:55.817 --> 25:57.817
We never got the chance to thank you

25:57.852 --> 25:59.819
for saving our lives from the ex-mayor.

25:59.854 --> 26:02.588
That was nothing.
- Not at all.

26:02.624 --> 26:04.390
I find it very fortuitous
you turned up when you did

26:04.425 --> 26:06.025
with that bazooka.

26:07.829 --> 26:09.595
I just felt a bit sorry
for Stan, the gardener,

26:09.631 --> 26:12.895
'cause he was picking up
bits of Galavan for weeks.

26:15.870 --> 26:19.071
And now here you are, the new mayor.

26:19.107 --> 26:21.107
Sometimes life has a way of working out.

26:21.142 --> 26:23.342
Yes, that's true.

26:27.315 --> 26:28.681
What is it, Master Bruce?

26:28.716 --> 26:31.818
A sign.

26:31.853 --> 26:33.286
Please excuse me.

26:35.957 --> 26:37.790
Right, well, I'll just
go and wet my beak.

26:37.826 --> 26:40.693
Congratulations again, Mr. Mayor.

26:48.036 --> 26:50.466
- Hey!
- Hey yourself.

26:51.172 --> 26:54.607
Funny, I never realized
how short you were.

26:54.642 --> 26:57.117
Who the hell are you?

26:58.079 --> 27:00.947
Not yet. This is too fun.

27:00.982 --> 27:02.448
Run along, little kitty.

27:02.483 --> 27:05.751
Go steal some more wallets.

27:05.787 --> 27:06.986
Hey.

27:09.190 --> 27:11.691
So sweet.

27:11.726 --> 27:13.893
There he is, the man of the hour.

27:13.928 --> 27:15.194
I have a surprise for you, Butch.

27:15.230 --> 27:16.829
Not in the mood.

27:20.168 --> 27:21.701
What's in the box?

27:21.736 --> 27:23.603
Open it.

27:29.510 --> 27:30.910
Thanks.

27:30.945 --> 27:33.646
- I already got one.
- Oh, of course you do.

27:33.681 --> 27:34.981
And you certainly
wouldn't need this one,

27:35.016 --> 27:37.483
as it's so similar to your
very own pocket square.

27:37.518 --> 27:38.985
This is from the Red Hood crime scene.

27:39.020 --> 27:41.354
It turns out that your suit

27:41.389 --> 27:42.388
and the Red Hood suits were all made

27:42.423 --> 27:44.190
by the same tailor, Mr. Fuji.

27:44.225 --> 27:46.692
That's some coincidence.

27:46.728 --> 27:48.027
I thought so myself.

27:48.062 --> 27:50.162
Which is why I called
Mr. Fuji, and he said

27:50.198 --> 27:51.597
that a large man with a metal hand...

27:51.633 --> 27:52.665
Not many of those running around...

27:52.700 --> 27:54.166
Bought all six of the suits,

27:54.202 --> 27:56.969
which means, ta-da, you're
the architect of the Red...

27:59.407 --> 28:02.341
I should snap your neck right now.

28:03.912 --> 28:06.545
You haven't heard my offer.

28:12.053 --> 28:13.352
We kill Penguin together.

28:14.956 --> 28:16.622
What are you talking about?

28:16.658 --> 28:19.292
- You're his guy.
- Oh, please. You fell for that act?

28:19.327 --> 28:20.593
Yes, he broke me out of Arkham...

28:20.628 --> 28:22.061
Very appreciative...

28:22.096 --> 28:23.896
But I was <i> not</i> cut out to be number two.

28:23.932 --> 28:25.398
I've simply been waiting for my moment,

28:25.433 --> 28:27.967
which you have graciously provided.

28:28.002 --> 28:32.838
How would you like to
run Gotham with me?

28:36.644 --> 28:39.278
The two of us... working together?

28:39.314 --> 28:41.480
You have proven yourself far
more cunning than I imagined.

28:41.516 --> 28:43.249
Now, I assume this little drama of yours

28:43.284 --> 28:44.717
was meant to climax tonight.

28:44.752 --> 28:49.588
So put on the hood, kill Penguin...

28:49.624 --> 28:51.557
I'll help you escape.

28:51.592 --> 28:53.626
Tomorrow we divide up the city.

28:56.264 --> 28:57.964
You'd really turn on him,

28:57.999 --> 29:00.099
after all he did for you?

29:02.170 --> 29:03.936
In a heartbeat.

29:09.377 --> 29:10.576
No.

29:10.611 --> 29:13.012
Okay.

29:13.047 --> 29:15.881
Then I guess it's time
for surprise number two.

29:20.621 --> 29:23.356
- You got to Zsasz?
- I got to Zsasz.

29:24.993 --> 29:27.793
And he got to Tabitha.

29:27.829 --> 29:29.528
Penguin's history.

29:29.564 --> 29:33.232
The question is, are you?

29:45.759 --> 29:47.727
Can I see your invitation?

29:48.455 --> 29:50.054
What are you doing here?

29:50.090 --> 29:52.323
- I was invited.
- Of course you were.

29:54.161 --> 29:55.260
You recognize her?

29:57.998 --> 29:59.564
Should I?

29:59.599 --> 30:01.332
I don't know.

30:04.004 --> 30:05.336
Hey, are you, you...

30:05.372 --> 30:08.158
- I'm me.
- Uh-huh.

30:08.842 --> 30:10.642
Well, I'm working, so...

30:10.677 --> 30:13.422
Actually, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

30:14.214 --> 30:15.547
Could we go somewhere more private?

30:18.418 --> 30:20.752
Fine, but make it quick.

30:27.794 --> 30:29.861
I can't believe you'd
turn on Oswald, too.

30:29.896 --> 30:33.031
Uh, hello. Pot, kettle, black.

30:33.066 --> 30:36.067
No, it's not the same thing. You...

30:36.102 --> 30:38.069
Never mind.

30:38.104 --> 30:39.704
I swear, your goons hurt Tabitha,

30:39.739 --> 30:40.905
so help me...

30:40.941 --> 30:43.975
Just do your job.

30:44.010 --> 30:45.777
- Oh...

30:45.812 --> 30:48.213
showtime.

30:48.248 --> 30:49.747
Put on in the mayor

30:49.783 --> 30:51.850
before I put one in Tabitha.

30:54.688 --> 30:56.988
Ladies, gentlemen,

30:57.023 --> 30:58.957
welcome to The Sirens.

30:58.992 --> 31:01.326
Tonight we're here to celebrate

31:01.361 --> 31:04.295
the Honorable Mayor Cobblepot.

31:04.331 --> 31:06.197
Our savior from the monsters,

31:06.233 --> 31:08.933
and the captain of our fair city.

31:08.969 --> 31:11.903
And now, the mayor would
like to say a few words.

31:13.273 --> 31:14.873
Ed, where've you been?

31:14.908 --> 31:16.074
I've been looking for you all evening.

31:16.109 --> 31:17.275
Oh, just tying up loose ends.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.577
I just wanted to say...

31:19.613 --> 31:21.012
good luck.

31:21.047 --> 31:23.114
Okay. Thank you.

31:29.489 --> 31:30.655
Thank you.

31:35.762 --> 31:37.462
Hmm.

31:37.497 --> 31:42.033
Tonight is a celebration,
not of my victory,

31:42.068 --> 31:43.902
but of Gotham's.

31:43.937 --> 31:44.969
This is a new day!

31:52.304 --> 31:54.545
I wouldn't celebrate yet, Mr. Mayor.

31:54.581 --> 31:56.047
Red Hoods ain't finished yet.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.282
Ed!

31:57.317 --> 31:58.616
- What are you doing?!
- Wait!

31:58.652 --> 31:59.984
Sorry, boss.

32:00.020 --> 32:02.120
Butch?!

32:07.627 --> 32:08.826
- Huh?
- Oops.

32:14.267 --> 32:16.634
The mayor...

32:17.804 --> 32:20.338
our mayor... vowed that all

32:20.373 --> 32:22.307
of the Red Hoods would be destroyed.

32:22.342 --> 32:24.175
And now we have the
real leader caught...

32:24.210 --> 32:27.284
red... handed.

32:30.583 --> 32:33.418
You really thought I'd
give you real bullets?

32:33.453 --> 32:35.720
You are an idiot!

32:37.958 --> 32:40.648
I will kill you for this!

32:43.630 --> 32:45.330
Sounds like we're missing all the fun.

32:45.365 --> 32:46.931
Got plenty of fun left for you.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.268
You know, if you're gonna take
a girl hostage in her own place,

32:50.303 --> 32:51.669
you might want to search it first.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.181
After all that I've done for you!

33:03.216 --> 33:06.651
- I gave you a job!
- I gave you everything!

33:06.686 --> 33:09.654
I used to be somebody in this town,

33:09.689 --> 33:11.956
then you and that sniveling
little son of a...

33:14.361 --> 33:16.427
Shut up!

33:21.868 --> 33:24.135
I am shocked...

33:24.170 --> 33:25.903
and grieved...

33:26.899 --> 33:30.174
that one of my dearest
friends has betrayed me.

33:31.745 --> 33:35.013
But let it be known
that Oswald Cobblepot

33:35.048 --> 33:38.216
will prosecute anyone
who threatens Gotham!

33:38.251 --> 33:39.517
Hear, hear!

33:40.553 --> 33:41.553
Yeah!

33:43.056 --> 33:44.589
Upsy-daisy.

33:47.027 --> 33:48.893
- Oh, my God.

33:50.797 --> 33:52.063
Showtime.

33:56.269 --> 33:58.603
- Oswald, move.

34:00.573 --> 34:02.573
I am gonna enjoy this.

34:05.445 --> 34:07.845
Best... party... ever.

34:09.949 --> 34:10.848
Wait.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.250
- Not now.
- Ed!

34:14.587 --> 34:15.753
Ed!

34:16.790 --> 34:17.790
Ed!

34:18.824 --> 34:20.224
- Ed!

34:20.260 --> 34:22.560
- Oh!

34:32.913 --> 34:34.179
So, what's up?

34:34.214 --> 34:37.282
I hired Jim Gordon to
help me locate Ivy.

34:37.318 --> 34:39.851
And?

34:39.887 --> 34:41.719
There was a redhead
that had her sweater,

34:41.755 --> 34:43.522
but it wasn't Ivy.

34:45.728 --> 34:48.293
Saying it out loud, I realize,
doesn't sound that impressive.

34:48.329 --> 34:49.561
No, it doesn't.

34:49.596 --> 34:51.763
That's really why you
brought me up here?

34:54.635 --> 34:57.069
You are the real Bruce...

34:57.103 --> 34:59.327
'cause nobody else would be this boring.

35:00.274 --> 35:02.766
- Great work, detective.
- That's not all.

35:07.748 --> 35:10.282
We've been friends a long time, Selina.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.316
And ever since you've known me,

35:11.352 --> 35:12.851
I've been dedicated to one thing,

35:12.886 --> 35:14.619
but that's done.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.154
I don't know what's next, but I know...

35:16.190 --> 35:18.890
Would you, please...
just say what you mean?

35:18.926 --> 35:20.058
I like you...

35:21.628 --> 35:23.829
as more than a friend.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.936
It would be nice if you
said something back.

35:33.216 --> 35:35.483
How many girls have you dated?

35:35.518 --> 35:37.418
- What do you mean?

35:37.453 --> 35:39.220
It's not a trick question.

35:39.255 --> 35:40.721
How many girls have you dated?

35:40.757 --> 35:43.090
- None.
- None. Hmm.

35:43.126 --> 35:45.092
Have you ever thought that maybe

35:45.128 --> 35:46.460
you only like me because

35:46.496 --> 35:48.095
I'm literally the only girl you know?

35:48.131 --> 35:49.930
That's not true. I feel something.

35:49.966 --> 35:51.966
And I know you do, too. We're the same.

35:52.001 --> 35:53.801
In what universe are we the same?

35:53.836 --> 35:55.603
- The money doesn't matter.
- Try not having it.

35:55.638 --> 35:57.772
It matters.

36:02.912 --> 36:05.267
There's something between us.

36:05.681 --> 36:07.615
I know there is.

36:07.650 --> 36:10.017
You have to see that.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.921
Rule one.

36:14.724 --> 36:16.657
Don't ever tell me

36:16.692 --> 36:18.292
what I have to do.

36:27.437 --> 36:30.037
So, you do have feelings for me?

36:30.073 --> 36:33.232
- I'm confused.
- Good.

36:42.585 --> 36:44.552
Come on, just tell me.

36:44.587 --> 36:47.788
I got all dressed up.
I even put on lipstick.

36:47.824 --> 36:49.123
I could lose my job.

36:49.158 --> 36:50.658
What are you offering?

36:50.693 --> 36:53.060
Fine, then I'll say something.

36:53.096 --> 36:55.863
If I'm right, you just nod.

36:55.898 --> 36:59.300
You ran tests on Alice Tetch's blood.

36:59.335 --> 37:00.835
You found something in her blood.

37:00.870 --> 37:04.472
A virus, or infection or something.

37:04.507 --> 37:06.369
Do I have to go over the rules again?

37:06.421 --> 37:09.210
Let's have new rules, sweetie.

37:09.245 --> 37:12.480
I'll tell you what we're
doing with Alice Tetch's blood

37:12.515 --> 37:14.081
and in return...

37:14.117 --> 37:15.249
you...

37:15.284 --> 37:16.751
O...kay.

37:18.754 --> 37:19.954
Excuse me?

37:19.989 --> 37:22.089
What are you doing?

37:23.392 --> 37:26.327
Two whiskeys and a pineapple
juice for this guy.

37:26.362 --> 37:27.728
What's going on?

37:27.763 --> 37:30.231
- To go.
- What's going on?

37:32.235 --> 37:33.601
I think you were just leaving.

37:36.772 --> 37:38.339
Forget this.

37:38.374 --> 37:40.074
Trust me. I'm gonna try.

37:45.481 --> 37:46.947
What are you doing here?

37:46.983 --> 37:48.649
Just walking by.

37:48.684 --> 37:49.917
Saw you through the window.

37:49.952 --> 37:52.186
- Took it as a sign.
- Like hell.

37:52.221 --> 37:54.021
You tracked me here.

37:54.056 --> 37:55.956
And for the record,

37:55.992 --> 37:57.491
I could've gotten what I wanted

37:57.527 --> 37:59.793
from that creep without
compromising my honor.

37:59.829 --> 38:01.662
I know...

38:01.697 --> 38:02.897
but you don't have to.

38:04.267 --> 38:05.866
I'll tell you what you want to know.

38:08.964 --> 38:11.545
I thought you wanted to keep the
woman and the reporter separate.

38:11.597 --> 38:13.066
- Is that an option?
- No.

38:14.742 --> 38:15.980
Well, then.

38:19.796 --> 38:22.229
You are gonna have to
buy me dinner, though.

38:22.265 --> 38:24.331
What's good here?

38:35.378 --> 38:36.977
It's ginger tea with honey.

38:37.013 --> 38:39.815
It's my mother's remedy
for a sore throat.

38:42.084 --> 38:43.717
You sure you don't need a doctor?

38:43.753 --> 38:45.686
No, I'm fine.

38:47.423 --> 38:48.522
I still don't understand

38:48.558 --> 38:50.493
why you didn't tell me
what you were doing.

38:52.041 --> 38:56.003
Your shock when seeing
Butch had to be genuine.

38:56.466 --> 38:59.200
The people had to believe it...

38:59.235 --> 39:00.267
and they did.

39:00.303 --> 39:02.236
And once again, you're the city's hero.

39:04.774 --> 39:06.574
But you were almost killed.

39:06.609 --> 39:09.543
And you saved me... again.

39:13.983 --> 39:16.335
I hope you know, Oswald...

39:17.253 --> 39:19.186
I would do anything for you.

39:21.757 --> 39:23.791
You can always count on me.

39:32.001 --> 39:33.200
Thank you.

39:49.118 --> 39:50.484
Need a hand, kitten?

39:50.520 --> 39:53.087
I got it.

40:07.970 --> 40:09.670
Hold on, Butch.

40:18.933 --> 40:21.682
Sir, the ambulance carrying
Butch Gilzean was just hijacked.

40:21.717 --> 40:23.083
Damn it!

40:23.119 --> 40:24.418
Put out a BOLO.

40:24.453 --> 40:26.086
I'll call the mayor.

40:40.403 --> 40:42.770
Oh, yes.

40:46.676 --> 40:48.842
<i>M-M-Mister, please.</i>

40:48.878 --> 40:50.444
<i>Shh.</i>

40:51.600 --> 40:55.649
My dear, sweet sister.

40:55.685 --> 40:57.451
Just look...

40:57.486 --> 41:00.120
at what he did to you.

41:00.156 --> 41:02.556
He took you from me!

41:02.592 --> 41:06.961
We belonged... together!

41:08.030 --> 41:10.030
And he killed you.

41:10.066 --> 41:13.567
But, mister, I-I'm not dead.

41:17.234 --> 41:19.707
If only that were true.

41:33.656 --> 41:38.425
Those who hurt you...

41:38.461 --> 41:41.495
will feel my pain...

41:43.265 --> 41:47.334
when my sweet and terrible vengeance

41:47.370 --> 41:49.937
upon them rains.
