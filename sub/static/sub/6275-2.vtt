WEBVTT

00:12.500 --> 00:14.250
TERRY:
The old man made parole.

00:14.333 --> 00:17.417
He wasn't supposed to be out
for five more years.

00:17.500 --> 00:18.667
He's out, Ray.

00:19.667 --> 00:22.041
SEAN: How the fuck
did this happen, Ray?

00:22.125 --> 00:23.750
He'd better not
be coming here.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.792
No lie lives
forever, Raymond.

00:25.875 --> 00:27.458
DEONTE:
She was doing blow all night.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.333
She's dead, dawg.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.625
LEE:
Guy has a $200 million
heterosexual movie coming out

00:31.709 --> 00:35.625
in a month, picks up a tranny
on Sunset Boulevard.

00:35.709 --> 00:37.333
I didn't know it
was a guy, I swear.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.834
RAY:
I got an idea.

00:38.917 --> 00:40.041
We can kill two birds
with one stone.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.291
Thanks for doing this, man.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.166
Suck one cock,
you're a cocksucker for life.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.875
Get caught with a dead girl,
admit to a drug problem,

00:45.959 --> 00:47.208
go to rehab, no problem.

00:47.291 --> 00:48.208
STU:
This chick

00:48.291 --> 00:49.834
has her claws in me.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.291
I want you to follow her.

00:51.375 --> 00:53.083
ASHLEY:
What are you doing here, Ray?

00:53.166 --> 00:53.542
You have a stalker.

00:53.625 --> 00:55.709
(laughs)

00:55.792 --> 00:57.375
TERRY:
Bunchy had a slip.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.125
You want me to send someone?

00:58.208 --> 01:01.041
Nah, I ain't done drinking yet.

01:01.125 --> 01:01.959
You remember
Dad's girlfriend Claudette?

01:02.041 --> 01:03.875
They had a kid.
They what?

01:03.959 --> 01:06.583
TERRY:
His name's Daryll.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.166
You fall in love easily.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.750
Did you fuck her?

01:10.834 --> 01:12.709
No.
STU:
What a shame.

01:12.792 --> 01:14.542
Your husband fucked
my girlfriend.

01:16.959 --> 01:19.208
(bones crack, Stu screams)

01:19.291 --> 01:20.625
My father coming here?

01:20.709 --> 01:22.542
You let him near this family,
everything we worked for--

01:22.625 --> 01:24.750
it'll be over.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.500
You're sick, Ray.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.834
You got a hole in your heart.

01:28.917 --> 01:30.000
Motherfucker!

01:30.083 --> 01:32.375
You go near my family,

01:32.458 --> 01:33.542
I'll fucking kill you.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.500

RAY:
Something important.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.166

anything involving a priest.
Check the morgue

03:43.500 --> 03:45.125
and the coroner's office--
last few days.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.583
In Boston?

03:46.667 --> 03:47.542
Yeah, Boston.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.083
Okay, boss, I'm on it.

03:49.166 --> 03:50.583
I'll call you as soon
as I find anything.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.291
Thanks, hon.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.125
MICKEY:
There once was a
bird of yellow bill.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.625
He hopped upon
my windowsill.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.667
I lured him in
with bits of bread

04:00.750 --> 04:02.500
And then I smashed
his fucking head.

04:02.583 --> 04:03.834
(laughs)

04:03.917 --> 04:05.041
Abby, me darling.

04:05.125 --> 04:08.041
Top of the
morning to you.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.667
He never come home?

04:13.792 --> 04:16.375
What a setup
you got here.

04:16.458 --> 04:17.500
Unbelievable.

04:17.583 --> 04:19.625
Stove has six burners.

04:19.709 --> 04:20.667
Yolks in the eggs?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.417
They're orange.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.458
Almost had to put sunglasses on
to scramble 'em.

04:24.542 --> 04:26.125
(laughing):
Even the chickens
are happy here.

04:28.000 --> 04:30.917
Glad you like it, Mickey.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.500
Go get dressed;
we're late.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.125
Can we spend the
day with Grandpa?

04:37.208 --> 04:39.333
Come on, Mom, please, we
already missed the bus.

04:39.417 --> 04:41.333
No, absolutely not.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.667
Come on, breakfast.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.834
Please, Mom.

04:44.917 --> 04:46.166
I said no.

04:46.250 --> 04:48.709
(dishes clattering)

04:53.166 --> 04:56.000
Eat some breakfast,
then go get dressed.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.792
Oh, there's our girl.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.959
How's Bernadette today?

05:11.583 --> 05:13.458
She's fine.

05:13.542 --> 05:15.417
Is that your wife?

05:20.250 --> 05:22.750
She asked you
a question.

05:24.834 --> 05:26.709
We never married.

05:29.125 --> 05:32.041
You guys still together?

05:34.333 --> 05:35.458
She passed.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.750
A long time ago.

05:39.834 --> 05:42.667
Not recent.

05:43.875 --> 05:46.667
All right, then.

05:58.041 --> 06:00.208
Great guns you got there.

06:04.917 --> 06:05.458
Thank the lady.

06:06.792 --> 06:09.625
Thanks.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.291
(phone ringing)

06:24.000 --> 06:25.959
Hello.

06:26.041 --> 06:26.667
Hey.

06:26.750 --> 06:28.333
Something came up last night.

06:28.417 --> 06:29.375
I stayed in town.

06:29.458 --> 06:30.291
Mm-hmm.

06:30.375 --> 06:33.041
I wasn't with that girl, Abs.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.333
Okay, fine.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.500
Okay, fine?

06:38.583 --> 06:40.500
We should talk.

06:40.583 --> 06:41.750
Agreed.

06:41.834 --> 06:42.125
I'm on my way.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.834
What, now?

06:43.917 --> 06:45.083
Yeah, now.
Why not now?

06:45.166 --> 06:46.458
Hi.

06:46.542 --> 06:47.917
I got to drop the kids
at school first.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.959
They missed the bus.

06:49.041 --> 06:49.959
All right.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.125
See you soon.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.041
Morning, Grandpa.

06:53.125 --> 06:56.041
Here's my princess, yeah.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.417
Did you get good
sleep last night?

06:59.500 --> 07:00.917
Mm-hmm.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.250
Hey, Bridg, did you see
that card for a taxi company?

07:04.333 --> 07:06.291
(Bridget and Mickey
speaking indistinctly)

07:06.375 --> 07:08.208
I break up this love affair
for a second?

07:08.291 --> 07:10.083
It doesn't matter anyway.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.458
Bridget, now!

07:11.542 --> 07:12.834
Yes.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.875
RAY:
Why don't you ask her out?

07:14.959 --> 07:17.250
Nah. She's out
of my league.

07:17.333 --> 07:19.250
What are you talking about?
She likes you.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.333
I don't
think so.

07:22.417 --> 07:25.375
She likes those
big guns of yours.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.834
Get in the car, Mickey.
I'll drop you at the gym.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.375
I don't want to put you out.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.291
No, it's fine.
Come on. Let's go.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.750
Sometimes
the cabs don't come.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.750
(hip hop playing)

07:57.792 --> 07:58.208
Where's
Mickey?

07:58.291 --> 08:00.875
I ain't seen him.

08:00.959 --> 08:02.542
How long's this gonna last,
Bunch?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.709
Hmm?

08:04.792 --> 08:06.417
The minute he's back,
you start up again?

08:06.500 --> 08:07.375
Nah.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.917
I started before that.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.917
TERRY:
Come on, Ray.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.458
Early for this.

08:11.542 --> 08:12.875
Why don't you give
Dad a chance?

08:12.959 --> 08:15.125
(scoffs)

08:17.125 --> 08:19.166
You don't have a fucking clue,
do you?

08:25.041 --> 08:26.583
Keep an eye on him today.

08:26.667 --> 08:27.250
All right.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.166
Thanks for
the ride.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.750
(phone ringing)

08:31.834 --> 08:33.250
LENA:
Lee's called ten times.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.625
Put him through.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.250
Hold on.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.542
You're on.

08:37.625 --> 08:38.417
LEE:
Where the fuck are you?

08:38.500 --> 08:40.417
I've called at least

08:40.500 --> 08:41.583
ten times...

08:48.875 --> 08:51.583
I've never seen
the Pacific Ocean.

08:51.667 --> 08:53.709
Dreamt about it
in prison.

08:53.792 --> 08:56.583
What color
is the water?

08:56.667 --> 08:57.959
It's nice.

08:58.041 --> 08:59.667
Not blue like the
Caribbean or anything,

08:59.750 --> 09:00.792
but it's-it's nice.

09:00.875 --> 09:01.375
Good.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.583
Sounds
beautiful.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.041
I won't say anything
to Dad about Grandpa
staying over

09:07.125 --> 09:08.041
if we don't have to go
to school today.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.333
You little shit.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.166
You blackmailing
me now?

09:12.250 --> 09:13.166
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.208
What does
that mean?

09:15.291 --> 09:17.709
It means
that you're just like Dad.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.667
He blackmails people
for a living.
Bridget,
cut it out.

09:19.750 --> 09:20.959
You can say it, but I can't?

09:21.041 --> 09:21.458
I was joking.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.041
No, you weren't.

09:23.125 --> 09:26.041
Everybody
be nice.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.375
Did you know you broke
Stu Feldman's hand?

09:42.250 --> 09:43.834
So you think this is funny?

09:43.917 --> 09:46.041
He's one of our
biggest clients.

09:46.125 --> 09:47.667
I want you to go see
him at Paramount,

09:47.750 --> 09:49.208
get down on your
hands and knees,

09:49.291 --> 09:52.000
and give him the best blow job
of his life!

09:52.083 --> 09:54.000
And then beg him
to take us back.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.583
Shouldn't you be sitting shivah?

09:57.667 --> 09:58.000
I'm allowed to
leave if there's

09:58.083 --> 09:59.333
a crisis.

09:59.417 --> 10:01.750
If a human life's in danger

10:01.834 --> 10:02.917
and so
forth.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.625
It's called pikuach nefesh.

10:04.709 --> 10:05.417
You should know that, Lee.
Someone's life

10:05.500 --> 10:07.000
is in danger?
Yes, possibly.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.166
Who?

10:08.250 --> 10:09.166
A client.

10:09.250 --> 10:12.250
A secret client?

10:15.667 --> 10:16.709
I think

10:16.792 --> 10:17.875
breaking the hand of one

10:17.959 --> 10:19.333
of our biggest clients
is a crisis.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.583
You know what else is a crisis?

10:21.667 --> 10:24.417
My fucking partner
losing his mind.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.667
That's a crisis.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.250
He didn't show up on set.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.333
He's locked himself
in his house.

10:30.417 --> 10:33.041
He's freaking out.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.875
Did he say how they
got in the house?

10:34.959 --> 10:36.250
He doesn't know.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.875
He kept saying they
"breached his security."

10:40.458 --> 10:42.834
It's your father, right?

10:42.917 --> 10:46.583
What are we gonna do
about him, Raymond?

10:46.667 --> 10:48.834
(sighs)
We don't know it's Mickey.

10:48.917 --> 10:50.500
First things first.
(phone rings)

10:52.625 --> 10:54.041
Yeah, Lee, what's up?

10:54.125 --> 10:57.041
You didn't think I'd find out
Sean Walker didn't go to work

10:57.125 --> 10:58.500
this morning?
Studio expects the star

10:58.583 --> 10:59.625
of their film to show up on set.

10:59.709 --> 11:02.291
It hurts you don't tell me
these things.

11:02.375 --> 11:04.083
First Stu Feldman, now this.

11:04.166 --> 11:05.959
Do you know the penalties
involved here

11:06.041 --> 11:07.542
that come out of our money?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.083
This is stretching
my asshole to its...

11:10.166 --> 11:11.417
I can't listen to this.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.625
I'm in mourning.

11:21.250 --> 11:24.250
(phone rings)

11:24.333 --> 11:26.166
Hi.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.667
RAY:
Something came up.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.417
Something always comes up.

11:29.500 --> 11:30.792
I got to work.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.000
We'll talk tonight.

11:34.291 --> 11:35.709
You okay?

11:35.792 --> 11:37.291
I can't really talk right now.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.166
Kids are late
for school.

11:39.250 --> 11:40.500
I got to concentrate
on driving.

11:40.583 --> 11:44.417
All right, see you later.

11:47.792 --> 11:49.500
We're going to Malibu.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.917
No school today.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.041
Really?

11:53.125 --> 11:54.458
Yeah, really.

12:03.250 --> 12:06.125
She was dead.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.834
Her eyes were open.

12:11.041 --> 12:13.458
But she was still there, man.

12:13.542 --> 12:15.625
Her soul was there.

12:15.709 --> 12:17.041
I could feel it.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.041
It's called the Bardo state.

12:24.125 --> 12:27.458
I read about it in the
Tibetan Book of the Undead.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.000
It's a great fucking book.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.375
What did you do?

12:46.458 --> 12:49.667
I walked over,

12:49.750 --> 12:51.333
opened the sliding door,

12:51.417 --> 12:53.291
and...

12:53.375 --> 12:54.583
let her out.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.959
It was beautiful.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.041
She flew away.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.458
(phone buzzing)

13:15.417 --> 13:18.250
(panting)

13:23.375 --> 13:25.250
(laughs)

13:25.333 --> 13:27.125
Wow.

13:38.625 --> 13:40.041
Where are we?

13:40.125 --> 13:41.709
(doorbell rings)

13:41.792 --> 13:44.709
RAY:
We're at Sean's house.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.375
(doorbell rings)

13:49.458 --> 13:51.000
Come on, Sean,
open the fucking door.

13:57.333 --> 14:00.166
(beeps)

14:29.500 --> 14:31.917
You promised me

14:32.000 --> 14:33.583
this wouldn't
come back.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.083
You promised me.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.333
You said
you'd take care of this.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.083
And I meant it.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.959
Did you see how he signed it?

14:39.041 --> 14:40.291
"Good times"?

14:40.375 --> 14:41.792
I shot your fucking
girlfriend in the head,

14:41.875 --> 14:44.000
high on your father's coke,

14:44.083 --> 14:45.458
and then we sent him
to prison for 20 years.

14:45.542 --> 14:46.542
"Good times"?

14:46.625 --> 14:48.792
How did it get here?

14:48.875 --> 14:51.917
How the fuck did he
breach my security?

14:52.000 --> 14:52.625
He said "breach" again.
(phone buzzes)

14:52.709 --> 14:54.792
Hang on a second, Sean.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.583
Where you going?

14:56.667 --> 14:58.500
Just... it'll be okay.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.166
What do you mean?
Where's he going in the...?

15:00.250 --> 15:01.375
Yeah, Tommy, what's up?

15:01.458 --> 15:02.291
Look, you haven't aged a day.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.667
Look how handsome you are.
Who's Tommy?

15:03.750 --> 15:06.667
I just got a video.

15:06.750 --> 15:08.333
I think it's
of me doing something

15:08.417 --> 15:10.208
I shouldn't have been doing.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.458
Like what?

15:12.542 --> 15:13.875
What are you doing in it, Tommy?

15:13.959 --> 15:16.458
I'm sucking dick, all right?

15:16.542 --> 15:18.667
(sighs)

15:18.750 --> 15:22.458
I'm learning a lot
about my addictions right now.

15:22.542 --> 15:23.959
Listen to me, Tommy.

15:24.041 --> 15:26.375
Send it to me right now
and then delete it.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.125
And, Tommy...

15:27.208 --> 15:29.542
don't tell anyone about this.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.667
You mean tell someone and ruin
my fucking entire career?

15:30.750 --> 15:32.000
I'm not stupid, Ray.

15:32.083 --> 15:35.792
Tommy, I need you
to come back inside.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.291
We don't take phone calls
during group.

15:37.375 --> 15:38.333
You know what?
Just leave me alone.

15:38.417 --> 15:40.250
I'm not even a drug addict,
I'm a sex addict.

15:49.583 --> 15:52.250
Are you filming this?

15:52.333 --> 15:54.333
No, no.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.041
(laughs)

16:00.125 --> 16:01.208
Wow.

16:08.208 --> 16:10.000
SEAN:
You take

16:10.083 --> 16:12.000
a phone call when someone's
threatening my life?

16:12.083 --> 16:13.792
What the fuck is
wrong with you, Ray?

16:13.875 --> 16:14.875
Who's more important than me?

16:14.959 --> 16:17.875
EZRA:
Why did Mickey come here?

16:17.959 --> 16:19.208
What does he want?

16:19.291 --> 16:20.625
Who cares what he wants?

16:20.709 --> 16:21.667
We owe him.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.208
We don't owe him shit.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.542
He broke into my fucking house.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.083
I can't go out.

16:26.166 --> 16:27.709
I can't go to work.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.000
I'm gonna go to jail.
Listen to me.

16:29.083 --> 16:31.709
It's my problem
and I'm gonna take care of it.

16:31.792 --> 16:34.083
We have to come clean.

16:34.166 --> 16:35.500
It's the only solution.

16:35.583 --> 16:37.166
Ruth would want that.

16:37.250 --> 16:37.834
SEAN:
You know what I think?

16:37.917 --> 16:41.208
I think
it's a shakedown.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.083
I'm not gonna let
that happen, Sean.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.500
Yolanda?

16:45.583 --> 16:47.417
No, you won't, Ray.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.333
You know why?

16:51.750 --> 16:54.041
(baby cooing)

16:56.583 --> 17:00.166
Look at her.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.166
She's so innocent.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.083
So pure.

17:06.166 --> 17:08.041
She's my little angel.

17:10.792 --> 17:13.458
You can't let anyone
hurt my family, Ray.

17:13.542 --> 17:15.542
I won't.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.750
I need the security tapes
for the house, Sean.

17:17.834 --> 17:20.000
She needs me.

17:20.083 --> 17:21.583
You know how much money
I gave after Katrina?

17:21.667 --> 17:24.375
Yeah.
Darfur?

17:24.458 --> 17:25.959
I'm a good person.
I know you are, Sean.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.625
You know, I struggle, I hurt.

17:27.709 --> 17:30.709
I make mistakes.

17:30.792 --> 17:32.709
But I always do the right thing.

17:32.792 --> 17:35.583
I make this world
a better place.

17:35.667 --> 17:36.667
And you've got
to help me, Ray.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.542
I love you, man.

17:40.542 --> 17:43.291
Yeah.

17:43.375 --> 17:44.458
Smell her head.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.542
(baby cries)

17:46.625 --> 17:49.375
Yeah.

17:52.667 --> 17:53.917
Here, Ezra,
smell her head.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.792
Smell her head.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.125
(Ezra mumbles softly)

17:59.208 --> 18:01.625
Oh, my, oh, my.

18:01.709 --> 18:03.875
I need the tapes, Sean.

18:10.917 --> 18:13.000
I thought we could start with
an aperitif and then have lunch.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.750
I don't know what
an aperitif is.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.417
Here, keep this.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.667
This whole place.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.166
You got to be kidding me.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.000
This is paradise.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.375
I've never seen anything like
it in my whole frigging life.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.291
You see the tits on that one?

18:27.375 --> 18:27.667
Here.

18:27.750 --> 18:29.458
(laughs)

18:29.542 --> 18:29.834
That's for you.

18:29.917 --> 18:30.750
Thank you.

18:30.834 --> 18:33.625
That's for you.

18:33.709 --> 18:35.834
Come here, come here.

18:35.917 --> 18:38.667
(laughing): Mickey.
Buy yourself something sexy.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.000
I want to spend some time
with my grandson.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.625
What do you got?

18:51.917 --> 18:53.542
What the fuck is that?

18:53.625 --> 18:55.834
It's Detox Number Three.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.166
It's all yours, here.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.375
(boxers grunting)

19:05.000 --> 19:06.959
I heard they got
a bout coming up

19:07.041 --> 19:08.875
over at the Commerce Casino.

19:08.959 --> 19:11.375
I don't know, we'll see.

19:11.458 --> 19:12.917
It's got to be the right
fight or you get hurt.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.750
Move your feet,
hands up.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.875
Get your jab working.

19:16.959 --> 19:19.041
Again-- you want to be a
fighter, you fire the jab.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.917
Little pitty-pat-ass punches.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.375
Hey, I got money coming--
I'll stake you.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.625
Nobody's staking anybody.
I said we'll see.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.625
One, two, three, four.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.208
You're wasting my time.

19:33.291 --> 19:34.709
Think, move your feet.

19:34.792 --> 19:38.041
The jab is like a cane to
a blind man, you understand?

19:38.834 --> 19:39.834
Where's my dad?

19:39.917 --> 19:42.208
I ain't seen him, Bunch.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.250
Well, you left
with him last night.

19:43.333 --> 19:43.667
He said he ain't seen him.

19:43.750 --> 19:47.041
All right?

19:47.125 --> 19:48.875
Let's go for
Christ's sakes.

19:48.959 --> 19:51.333
(punches hitting pads)

20:02.959 --> 20:06.500
(drawers opening, shutting)

20:28.917 --> 20:31.417
What you doing,
Bunch?

20:31.500 --> 20:33.458
What does it look
like I'm doing?

20:33.542 --> 20:34.834
Baking a fucking cake?

20:35.875 --> 20:37.709
Let's dance, Ter...

20:37.792 --> 20:39.834
Sit down.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.709
I want to party.

20:45.792 --> 20:47.792
Where's Mickey?

20:47.875 --> 20:49.750
You lived without him
the last 20 years.

20:49.834 --> 20:51.875
Relax.

20:53.792 --> 20:55.000
Oh, no, don't...

20:55.083 --> 20:56.208
(lock clicks)

20:56.291 --> 20:57.500
Oh, don't you...

20:57.583 --> 20:59.500
(thumping, muffled yelling)

20:59.583 --> 21:01.458
Fuck you, Terry.

21:01.542 --> 21:03.166
God, fuck.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.959
Conor?

21:10.875 --> 21:12.917
You a fag?

21:13.417 --> 21:16.667
I don't think so.

21:16.750 --> 21:17.834
Met some stand-up
fags in prison.

21:17.917 --> 21:19.125
Good guys,

21:19.208 --> 21:20.542
tough guys.

21:21.875 --> 21:24.208
If one of your little friends

21:24.291 --> 21:27.500
wants to give you a blow job,
that's fine.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.041
A mouth is a mouth,

21:29.125 --> 21:30.834
but don't let anyone fuck you
in the ass.

21:30.917 --> 21:31.375
That's how you get sick.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.125
Thanks, Grandpa.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.375
TOMMY: Are you filming this?
CHLOE: No.

21:43.458 --> 21:43.792
No.

21:43.875 --> 21:46.709
(grunting)

21:51.417 --> 21:52.500
TOMMY: Whoo.
(whistles)

21:54.750 --> 21:56.250
(chuckles)

21:56.333 --> 21:58.000
My film is opening
in three days.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.625
Calm down.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.792
They want money
or they wouldn't have sent it.

22:01.875 --> 22:02.959
We just got to wait
for them to call.

22:03.041 --> 22:06.000
Um, no, we don't.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.458
I have her number.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.667
You what?

22:12.750 --> 22:14.291
I have her number.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.208
(chuckles)

22:16.291 --> 22:18.417
(sighs)
What? I called her sometimes.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.291
Yeah.
It-it wasn't always sex.

22:20.375 --> 22:21.250
She had a nice
vibe about her.

22:21.333 --> 22:23.458
Get her on the phone,
Tommy.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.834
Right now?

22:24.917 --> 22:26.417
Don't we need to,
like, call the FBI

22:26.500 --> 22:28.250
or something?

22:28.333 --> 22:31.250
Tommy, dial the fucking number
and ask her what she wants.

22:31.333 --> 22:32.750
Just like that?

22:32.834 --> 22:34.667
Yeah, just like that.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.917
Hi, Chloe, it's Tommy.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
(chuckles)

22:42.083 --> 22:44.959
Fine, how are you?

22:46.208 --> 22:48.375
Me, too.

22:48.458 --> 22:51.291
What are you wearing?

22:51.375 --> 22:52.500
All right, sorry.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.542
Chloe, what do you want?

23:01.875 --> 23:03.500
She wants
a million dollars.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.834
Yeah, I know.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.125
And she feels really bad.

23:09.208 --> 23:11.125
Set up a meet.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.750
I can't leave.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.709
I'm in rehab, remember?

23:14.792 --> 23:16.834
For me.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.917
(sighs)

23:24.792 --> 23:26.667
(indistinct chatter)

23:29.208 --> 23:31.083
MICKEY:
She looks like

23:31.166 --> 23:33.834
she got punched
in the face.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.083
She went a few rounds
with Max Schmeling.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.333
(laughs)

23:39.417 --> 23:40.709
Give me a few minutes
with your mom, okay?

23:40.792 --> 23:42.333
Here.

23:42.417 --> 23:44.792
Mickey,
you're spoiling them.

23:44.875 --> 23:45.291
Let me do this.

23:45.375 --> 23:48.875
Means a lot to me.

23:48.959 --> 23:49.375
Say "thank you."
Thank you.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.875
Thanks, Grandpa.

23:50.959 --> 23:52.542
Stay together.

24:00.166 --> 24:02.667
How's your marriage?

24:02.750 --> 24:04.667
Things good?

24:04.750 --> 24:06.583
That's private, Mick.

24:12.709 --> 24:13.542
Why does he hate you so much?

24:19.750 --> 24:21.959
I was a terrible father.

24:22.041 --> 24:23.917
Selfish.

24:24.000 --> 24:27.166
I loved those kids,
but I fucked up.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.542
My wife was dying,

24:29.625 --> 24:31.208
money problems,

24:31.291 --> 24:33.875
a lot of mouths to feed.

24:33.959 --> 24:35.792
I was a criminal--
you know that, right?

24:37.917 --> 24:40.750
Me and some other fellas
had a little thing going.

24:40.834 --> 24:43.834
Did a little too much...

24:43.917 --> 24:46.083
nose candy,

24:46.166 --> 24:49.041
even sold it.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.917
It was the '80s--
what can I tell you?

24:52.000 --> 24:52.583
Very degenerate era.

24:55.834 --> 24:58.000
I done my time, Abby.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.834
Been in a cage

24:59.917 --> 25:01.750
for 20 fucking years.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.083
I guess that's not enough
for Ray.

25:04.166 --> 25:07.208
Now I'm out.

25:07.291 --> 25:08.875
The world is a beautiful place.

25:08.959 --> 25:12.583
Mick.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.959
(mumbles)

25:16.041 --> 25:19.041
I'm a sloppy eater.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.917
Someone broke into
Sean's house last night.

25:34.000 --> 25:34.583
Find out how he did it.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.709
See if you can I.D. him.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.917
Yes, boss.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.417
Here's Chloe.

25:40.500 --> 25:43.333
His name is Steven Hunter.

25:43.417 --> 25:44.125
Arrested six times
for prostitution.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.375
From Peoria, Illinois.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.709
Hey, bring me a sandwich, eh?

25:49.792 --> 25:51.875
What do you want?
Turkey, wheat.

25:51.959 --> 25:52.583
Mustard?
Yes.

25:52.667 --> 25:55.375
(easy listening music playing)

26:15.333 --> 26:17.583
I've never done this before.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.458
I'm not sure how it works.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.709
You're doing fine.

26:21.792 --> 26:24.667
You got a name?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.041
Ray Donovan.

26:26.125 --> 26:28.625
Chloe.

26:30.667 --> 26:33.333
Probably wondering
what a nice girl

26:33.417 --> 26:35.041
like me
would be doing this for.

26:35.125 --> 26:36.625
Not really.

26:36.709 --> 26:38.500
Tommy's a nice guy.

26:38.583 --> 26:39.667
I feel bad.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.542
I got to look
after myself, though.

26:41.625 --> 26:44.417
This could be my only chance
I ever have to change my life.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.834
You ever want to change
your life?

26:48.917 --> 26:50.125
What do you want, Chloe?

26:50.834 --> 26:52.667
Thank you for calling me that.

26:52.750 --> 26:55.000
I'm sure you know
my name is Steven.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.417
Cops always call me Steven

26:56.500 --> 26:59.041
whenever they arrest me.

26:59.125 --> 27:00.041
So mean, you know?

27:00.125 --> 27:02.333
I'm not a cop.

27:02.417 --> 27:03.417
What do you want?

27:03.500 --> 27:05.166
A million dollars.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.500
That's a big number.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.166
It's nothing compared
to the gross

27:08.250 --> 27:10.583
of Tommy Wheeler's movie
coming out this weekend.

27:10.667 --> 27:12.542
Right?

27:12.625 --> 27:15.083
Right.

27:20.458 --> 27:22.500
The guy over there,

27:22.583 --> 27:24.667
tell him to get lost.

27:31.792 --> 27:33.625
He's my boyfriend.

27:33.709 --> 27:36.542
I'm gonna use the money to have
a sex change operation.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.125
You don't have to tell me that.

27:40.208 --> 27:41.583
I want to.

27:41.667 --> 27:45.041
You make me want
to tell you things, Ray.

27:47.834 --> 27:51.083
RAY:
So, why don't you tell me
how you know Tommy Wheeler?

27:51.166 --> 27:54.792
CHLOE:
Girl needed help, he saw me.

27:54.875 --> 27:55.250
We got to talking.

27:55.333 --> 27:57.542
RAY:
Yeah?

27:57.625 --> 27:59.709
Here you go.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.542
So, that's it?

28:05.625 --> 28:07.667
I say a million dollars,
and you say "All right"?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.208
Yep.
Maybe I should've
asked for two.

28:09.291 --> 28:11.291
We done?

28:13.291 --> 28:14.792
I'm not a bad person, Ray.

28:14.875 --> 28:15.959
You're just in the wrong body.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.500
I like you.

28:21.583 --> 28:24.542
You say what you mean.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.375
I'll be in touch.

28:53.250 --> 28:55.250
Thanks.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.250
You get all that?
Yeah, boss.

28:56.333 --> 28:59.667
(phone ringing)

29:03.041 --> 29:04.542
Yeah, Lena, what's up?

29:04.625 --> 29:06.375
Listen, you were right.

29:06.458 --> 29:07.667
There was a priest killed
in a church

29:07.750 --> 29:09.750
in South Boston,
but that's all I can get.

29:09.834 --> 29:11.291
They're being real squirrely
about it; they won't give

29:11.375 --> 29:12.750
out a name,
they won't give out a photo.

29:12.834 --> 29:13.834
I'll try to have something more

29:13.917 --> 29:15.208
for you by the end of the day.

29:15.291 --> 29:16.542
It's important.

29:16.625 --> 29:17.291
Stay on it until you get
something solid.

29:17.375 --> 29:18.625
I will.

29:18.709 --> 29:20.125
Oh, Ray, uh, are the kids sick?

29:20.208 --> 29:21.917
What?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.375
Yeah, school called,
said they weren't there.

29:25.333 --> 29:26.417
(beeps)

29:26.500 --> 29:27.417
(shutter clicks)

29:27.500 --> 29:28.417
Ah.
(laughs)

29:28.500 --> 29:30.500
(phone ringing)

29:30.583 --> 29:31.542
Thank you very much.

29:31.625 --> 29:32.500
Bye.

29:32.583 --> 29:35.792
(ringing continues)

29:35.875 --> 29:38.208
Oh.

29:40.667 --> 29:43.125
You like that up the crack
of your ass like that?

29:43.208 --> 29:44.333
It doesn't bother you?

29:44.417 --> 29:45.917
Mickey, you're
embarrassing me.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.625
This is Abby. Leave a message,
I'll get back to you.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.000
I got to know things,
Abby.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.375
It's a whole new world.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.417
You can be my guide.

29:53.500 --> 29:56.542
(phone ringing)

29:59.625 --> 30:02.500
(ringing continues)

30:04.792 --> 30:07.709
(phone rings)
Hey, Dad.

30:07.792 --> 30:09.333
Where are you?

30:11.750 --> 30:13.375
Where are you, Con?

30:13.458 --> 30:15.083
Malibu.

30:15.166 --> 30:15.750
Where in Malibu?

30:15.834 --> 30:17.375
We're at
the Country Mart.

30:17.458 --> 30:19.375
Malibu
is beautiful.

30:19.458 --> 30:23.542
So is your family.

30:24.709 --> 30:27.500
Raymond?
What's going on?

30:27.583 --> 30:29.333
What happened?

30:30.041 --> 30:31.875
AVI:
What are you doing?

30:31.959 --> 30:33.542
No, no, no,
you can't do this.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.875
No, you can't
do that.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.375
Get your fucking hands
off me, Avi.

30:50.458 --> 30:52.375
Give me the
gun, Avi.
No.

30:52.458 --> 30:53.458
You need to calm the fuck down.

30:53.542 --> 30:55.542
You've been acting crazy
since your father got here.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.375
He's got my family.

30:57.458 --> 31:00.417
Give me the gun.

31:00.500 --> 31:01.333
Think, Raymond.

31:01.417 --> 31:02.834
Think about it.

31:02.917 --> 31:05.417
You gonna go shoot him
in front of your kids?

31:05.500 --> 31:07.959
In front of Abby?

31:09.542 --> 31:10.959
We'll handle it.

31:11.041 --> 31:12.792
We always do.

31:18.166 --> 31:19.000
CHLOE:
No!

31:19.083 --> 31:21.458
Aah!
No, no, don't you...

31:21.542 --> 31:22.625
No!

31:23.041 --> 31:24.583
(choking)

31:24.667 --> 31:26.333
Shh, shh, shh.

31:26.417 --> 31:28.000
Have you shown it
to anyone else?

31:30.041 --> 31:31.834
Have you sent it
to anyone else?

31:33.667 --> 31:36.041
Was there anyone else
there that night?

31:36.125 --> 31:37.291
No.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.000
(techno music playing)

31:45.583 --> 31:47.667
(music stops)

31:47.750 --> 31:49.250
Hey.

31:49.333 --> 31:50.792
Here.

31:52.458 --> 31:54.792
(Chloe choking)
RAY:
We have you

31:54.875 --> 31:56.750
on tape, Chloe.
You threaten

31:56.834 --> 31:59.250
Tommy Wheeler again,
you're dead.

31:59.333 --> 32:02.333
You understand me?

32:02.417 --> 32:03.667
(struggling for air)

32:03.750 --> 32:05.458
Say it.
I...

32:05.542 --> 32:07.959
Say "I understand."

32:08.041 --> 32:12.250
(struggling):
I... I understand.

32:15.583 --> 32:19.583
(panting)

32:37.333 --> 32:39.667
Any others?

32:43.208 --> 32:44.208
(panting):
No.

32:47.500 --> 32:48.125
I swear.

32:53.291 --> 32:57.125
(breathing deeply)

33:03.250 --> 33:06.500
You understand the path
you're walking down?

33:11.083 --> 33:14.083
You need to stop giving
blow jobs in the street.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.875
Stop doing drugs.

33:15.959 --> 33:18.417
This what you want for yourself?

33:21.917 --> 33:24.834
You don't know
fuck about me.

33:26.542 --> 33:30.083
I know, if you keep
this up, you're dead.

33:30.166 --> 33:32.333
That's how it ends.

33:33.500 --> 33:37.667
(sobbing)

33:42.333 --> 33:44.041
You'll be all right.

33:51.458 --> 33:53.291
We done?

33:53.375 --> 33:54.917
Yeah.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.333
You believe him?

33:56.417 --> 33:57.709
What?

33:57.792 --> 33:59.750
We got everything?

33:59.834 --> 34:02.875
Fucking amateur hour.

34:02.959 --> 34:04.875
You okay, boss?

34:04.959 --> 34:08.959
I'm fine.
Stop asking me.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.542
How mad
do you think Dad is?

34:21.625 --> 34:23.709
I don't know, Conor.

34:23.792 --> 34:25.166
Why'd you have to
fucking tell him?

34:25.250 --> 34:27.333
MICKEY:
Everybody relax.

34:27.417 --> 34:28.542
He's your father. He loves you.

34:28.625 --> 34:31.291
He'll understand.

34:31.375 --> 34:33.417
ABBY:
You didn't do
anything wrong, Con.

34:33.500 --> 34:36.667
I said it was okay.
I sanctioned it.

34:36.750 --> 34:38.291
He doesn't know what
"sanctioned" means.

34:38.375 --> 34:39.834
Yes, I do.
MICKEY:
All right,

34:39.917 --> 34:41.125
let's all get
along, okay?

34:41.208 --> 34:43.834
I don't even know
what "sanctions" means.

34:43.917 --> 34:44.834
(laughs)

34:44.917 --> 34:47.000
Abby, my love,
what does "sanctions" mean?

34:47.083 --> 34:49.250
(sighs)

34:57.917 --> 35:01.375
STU:
Go.
No, I'm gonna... go.

35:02.417 --> 35:07.542
Uh... uh, I didn't leave you
a drive-on pass, so...

35:08.583 --> 35:09.583
How did he get in here?

35:09.667 --> 35:10.250
ASSISTANT:
What?

35:10.333 --> 35:11.667
I didn't leave him
a pass.

35:11.750 --> 35:13.792
Okay?

35:17.417 --> 35:18.542
That's your
little girlfriend.

35:18.625 --> 35:20.375
Now she's my
little girlfriend.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.333
You know why?

35:23.417 --> 35:24.875
'Cause you broke
my fucking hand.

35:24.959 --> 35:28.166
And my wife left me.

35:29.500 --> 35:33.000
Now get down
on your hands and knees...

35:33.083 --> 35:35.458
and apologize.

35:36.792 --> 35:38.417
Lee said you'd blow me.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.792
Are you done?

35:40.875 --> 35:42.417
Yeah.

35:43.583 --> 35:45.208
Watch.

35:45.291 --> 35:47.542
(panting on video)

35:52.500 --> 35:55.083
Jesus.

35:56.125 --> 35:59.041
That guy can really suck cock.

35:59.125 --> 36:02.208
He should give my wife lessons.

36:04.166 --> 36:06.542
TOMMY: Are you filming this?
CHLOE: No, no.

36:06.625 --> 36:08.875
Is that Tommy?

36:09.000 --> 36:09.792
That's Tommy.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.041
You have a $200
million movie opening

36:12.125 --> 36:14.000
with him this
weekend.
What are we gonna do?

36:14.083 --> 36:16.709
Open your safe.
What?

36:16.792 --> 36:18.500
Open your fucking safe.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.166
♪ Private eyes ♪

36:27.250 --> 36:29.917
♪ They're
watching you. ♪
Stop.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.458
How much do you want?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.458
He's hot, isn't he?

36:42.375 --> 36:43.500
(sighing):
Yep.

36:47.542 --> 36:49.583
Find out who his trainer is.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.917
You want to go say hi
to your uncles?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.208
Mom, please.

36:58.291 --> 37:01.375
Not right now.
We have to get home.

37:01.458 --> 37:02.625
All right.

37:02.709 --> 37:04.500
Here, could you
just take one picture?

37:04.583 --> 37:06.000
One last picture, okay?

37:06.083 --> 37:08.625
All right,
one last one.
Thank you.

37:08.709 --> 37:10.125
Get out, Con.

37:10.208 --> 37:13.333
One more picture.
Is that okay?

37:14.000 --> 37:15.625
Perfect.

37:15.709 --> 37:18.000
MICKEY:
Look at these mugs. Come on.
(kids laugh)

37:22.792 --> 37:25.125
I love you.

37:25.208 --> 37:27.458
BRIDGET:
Come on, could I just run in

37:27.542 --> 37:28.000
and take one picture
of Bunchy and Terry

37:28.083 --> 37:29.959
for the family tree?

37:30.041 --> 37:30.917
Please, it's
important to me.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.417
We stay two minutes,

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
all right?
Two minutes,
I got it.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.208
Look who I brought home.

37:38.291 --> 37:42.083
Hey. There's Bunchy.
There's Uncle Bunch.

37:42.166 --> 37:44.750
Terry, the kids
are here.

37:44.834 --> 37:46.709
Hey, don't weep
on the kid.
(laughs)

37:46.792 --> 37:48.041
Pull yourself
together.

37:48.125 --> 37:49.834
Okay, wait,
you guys get together.

37:49.917 --> 37:50.500
I have to...
She wants to
take some pictures.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.709
How the hell
are you?

37:55.792 --> 37:56.375
Yeah, we're fine.

37:58.917 --> 38:01.000
Dad's here.

38:01.083 --> 38:02.500
That's something, huh?
MICKEY:
Family!

38:02.583 --> 38:05.291
Family is
a wonderful thing, huh?
(chuckles)

38:05.375 --> 38:06.333
Okay, now
you get out.

38:06.417 --> 38:08.000
Just let--
Conor, get out
of his way.

38:08.083 --> 38:10.458
Okay,
ready?

38:10.542 --> 38:11.667
MICKEY:
What are you gonna be?

38:11.750 --> 38:13.333
What kind of-- what is this?
What are you talking about?

38:13.417 --> 38:15.208
(Mickey speaking
indistinctly)

38:15.291 --> 38:17.583
Is that him?

38:17.667 --> 38:18.166
Your new brother?

38:18.250 --> 38:19.125
(quietly):
Yeah.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.250
MICKEY:
He is a good boxer.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.834
I trained him when,
when he was your age.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.125
Talk to Bridg a sec,
would you?

38:28.250 --> 38:30.333
Hi, I'm Abby Donovan.

38:30.417 --> 38:30.959
You must be Daryll.

38:31.041 --> 38:33.041
Yeah.
TERRY:
Bridg,

38:33.125 --> 38:34.333
you want to take a photo?

38:34.417 --> 38:36.041
MICKEY:
I trained all my kids to box.

38:36.125 --> 38:39.083
Come on, come
on, show him.

38:39.166 --> 38:41.375
Pow, pow. See, I trained him
when he was your age.

38:41.458 --> 38:41.875
You know what we're gonna do?

38:41.959 --> 38:44.166
The same way.

38:44.250 --> 38:45.542
I'm gonna get
you in here.

38:45.625 --> 38:47.625
Get the wraps on you.

38:47.709 --> 38:49.458
I haven't told
my kids yet.

38:49.542 --> 38:51.709
Would you mind not
meeting 'em right now?

38:51.792 --> 38:53.542
I'd like to
work up to it.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.583
Yeah, sure.
I mean, it's cool.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.917
I get it.
Black uncle thing...

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
Thank you.

38:59.083 --> 39:00.375
Yeah.

39:03.959 --> 39:06.000
It's really nice
to meet you.

39:06.083 --> 39:08.625
Nice to meet you,
too, Abby.

39:09.917 --> 39:11.083
BRIDGET: Okay, ready,
one, two, three...

39:11.166 --> 39:13.417
You are gonna
be a boxer.

39:13.500 --> 39:14.583
(Abby laughs)

39:14.667 --> 39:16.750
Okay, here, you
want to see?

39:16.834 --> 39:19.041
There's that one. Which
one do you like better?

39:19.125 --> 39:21.166
Look at these teeny-tinies.

39:21.250 --> 39:21.750
So goddamn big.

39:21.834 --> 39:24.667
(laughing)

39:26.166 --> 39:29.125
Come here, boy.

39:29.208 --> 39:31.083
Look at you.
ABBY:
Hey, Bridg,

39:31.166 --> 39:32.250
you got your pics yet?

39:32.333 --> 39:33.750
Yeah.
Well, let's go.

39:33.834 --> 39:35.500
Hey, hey,
are you married yet?

39:35.583 --> 39:37.083
No.
Me neither.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.750
(chuckles)

39:38.834 --> 39:40.208
You just got here.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.625
We got to go.

39:42.709 --> 39:45.333
Come on, Bridg.
(whispering):
Bye.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.500
Will you guys
come visit soon?
Sure.

39:47.583 --> 39:48.500
We'll see
you soon.

39:48.583 --> 39:49.709
Yeah.
Right, Pop?

39:49.792 --> 39:51.041
We'll see you
real soon.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.917
You need anything,
you call me.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.417
You got my number.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.458
You want to talk
about things--
mysteries of life,

39:57.542 --> 39:59.375
anything at all--
I'm a wise man.

39:59.458 --> 40:01.375
I learned a lot
in the can.

40:01.458 --> 40:02.583
Okay.

40:15.667 --> 40:16.834
(sighs)

40:45.083 --> 40:47.333
You have fun
with my family today, Mick?

40:47.417 --> 40:49.291
Sure.

40:49.375 --> 40:51.959
20 years in prison.

40:52.041 --> 40:53.542
Must've been hard.

40:53.625 --> 40:55.709
Right?

40:55.792 --> 40:57.750
(scoffs)

40:57.834 --> 40:59.959
Now you're gonna spin some story
how you didn't deserve it?

41:01.291 --> 41:03.250
(sighs)

41:03.333 --> 41:05.166
You deserved it, Mick.

41:05.250 --> 41:08.542
You deserve worse.

41:11.625 --> 41:13.959
You know what?

41:15.834 --> 41:17.375
I'm gonna give it to you.

41:20.917 --> 41:22.417
Ray-Ray.

41:32.041 --> 41:33.083
I just want my family back.

41:33.166 --> 41:34.041
No, you don't.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.500
You want my family.

41:35.583 --> 41:36.792
Never gonna happen.

41:36.875 --> 41:38.709
All right, come on.

41:38.792 --> 41:41.000
You won't see it coming.
