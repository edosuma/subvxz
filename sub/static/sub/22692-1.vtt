much green as inconvenient.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.400
Why is it inconvenient?

01:43.440 --> 01:45.560
Well, Jeremy,
tell the ladies and gentlemen

01:45.600 --> 01:49.040
why you decided to put
our tent precisely here.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.600
Ah, it is exactly here
because this spot

01:52.640 --> 01:56.360
is exactly half way
between May's house
and Hammond's house.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.080
So there is no squabbling

01:58.120 --> 02:00.520
over who had
the longest commute.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.840
Yes, but your house
is just over there.

-I can see it, just there.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.720
I haven't got a house.
You may remember
you blew it up.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.600
Oh, all right,
your backup house.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.960
Yeah, your spare house
is just there.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.400
This, however, is now.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.560
And we have
an important job to do.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.680
An important question
to answer.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.320
Which is better? The past,
the present, or the future?

05:02.360 --> 05:04.520
By which I mean,
which is better -

05:04.560 --> 05:09.240
petrol power, hybrid power,
or electrical power?

05:09.280 --> 05:13.560
Now, to do this,
we are going to use
the Lamborghini Aventador S,

05:13.600 --> 05:18.000
which has a petrol engine
and is therefore from
the pages of ancient history.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.480

our resident Neanderthal.

we have the Honda NSX,

05:26.280 --> 05:27.800
which is a modern hybrid.

05:27.840 --> 05:32.040

will be driven by somebody

Everything in the world now
is better than it's going
to be in another minute,

what that is yet.

It might be
the nuclear holocaust.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.480
Human kind can only
live in the present,

07:58.520 --> 08:01.560
and that's why you need
a Honda NSX. OK?

08:04.240 --> 08:08.880
The NSX
is by far the cleverest
of the three cars here.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.400
Because of its
dual powertrain.

08:15.080 --> 08:16.920
It has the dependability,

08:16.960 --> 08:19.360
the availability,
of fossil fuels.

08:19.400 --> 08:23.800
And the magic
and helpfulness,
if you like, of electricity.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.040
It's a hybrid and it
really is rather brilliant.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.600

They probably think this is

08:32.640 --> 08:37.280
some sort of Eastern European
electric milk float
in a supercar suit.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.160
Well, they're wrong.
Very wrong.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.080
I have four
massive electric motors here.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.000
One for each wheel.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.080
So I'm in
a 1,241 brake horsepower,

08:56.120 --> 08:58.080
all-electric supercar.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.240
The speed in this
is other-worldly,

09:03.280 --> 09:06.080
because it's achieved
so silently.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.440
It's funny, isn't it? I'm
shouting but I don't need to.

09:09.480 --> 09:10.960
I could talk quietly.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.880
Even when I'm
accelerating hard.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.840
(WHIRRING)

09:15.880 --> 09:18.000
I know the Rimac
is very pretty.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.480
I can see that.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.400
And I know it's very fast.

09:21.440 --> 09:25.080
But I also know...
it can't do this.

(ENGINE ROARING)

09:36.640 --> 09:38.680
Oh, my God!

09:45.800 --> 09:49.240
That is
a six-and-a-half-litre V12.

09:51.160 --> 09:54.400
Turning petrol into noise.
(CACKLES)

10:07.080 --> 10:08.800
Come on, Hammond, admit it.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.120
That is one hell of a noise.

10:11.160 --> 10:12.760
It is cannon fire.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.880
Fire! Bang-bang-
bang-bang-bang.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.960
It is like watching
the battle of Waterloo
from a spaceship.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.400
(CHUCKLES)

10:23.320 --> 10:26.000
I know it looks like
the three of us are just

10:26.040 --> 10:28.640
clowning around
in some supercars

10:28.680 --> 10:31.600
on a lovely, lovely day,
on a beautiful bit of road,

10:31.640 --> 10:33.720
but this is important work.

10:33.760 --> 10:37.320
(CHUCKLES) It is.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.880
It is.

10:40.920 --> 10:43.120
And to prove it's
important work,

10:43.160 --> 10:45.160
we decided to pull over

10:45.200 --> 10:48.480
and start acting like
important car journalists.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.280
You may mock the idea
of a Croatian supercar,

10:54.320 --> 10:59.480
but Rimac is already working
with Koenigsegg and Aston
Martin on their battery tech.

10:59.520 --> 11:01.000
It's a serious company.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.320
So serious that they make
nearly every bit of this car
themselves.

11:05.360 --> 11:09.680
Satnav, switch gear,
headlamps - all in-house.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.840
Mm, apart from the leather,
if you go for that,
which is Bulgarian.

11:12.880 --> 11:15.160
-I love Bulgarian leather.
-It's my favourite.

11:15.200 --> 11:18.520
But, anyway, the reason
I like the Aventador most

11:18.560 --> 11:21.960
is because it defines
the supercar.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.960
It wasn't designed to do a
billion round Brands Hatch.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.120
It was designed to do 9
on Knightsbridge.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.200
It was designed
to make people go "Wow",
and it does.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.600
If you wanna go fast,
buy a Ferrari.

11:32.640 --> 11:36.000
-Or a Rimac.
-No, that's for shaving
your legs if you're a lady.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.560
I love the Lamborghini as well.
The styling especially,
it's fantastic.

11:38.600 --> 11:41.400
But you know that the sort of
time and thought that

11:41.440 --> 11:44.320
Lamborghini put into that,
Honda put into things that

11:44.360 --> 11:46.880
they thought were important,
like making a new type of

11:46.920 --> 11:50.520
steel section for that pillar
so it can be smaller,
so you can see out better.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.640
Ten radiators
to cool the drivetrain

11:52.680 --> 11:56.760
and lots of other stuff that
make modern technology
simple to use.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.480
I just don't like it.

11:58.520 --> 12:01.640
Well, how is that relevant?
I'm talking about it
and I like it.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.360
-So you're wrong.
-I wanted to like it,
but I don't.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.560
-You're redundant.
-I didn't...
I really wanted to like it.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.120
I've been ten years
looking forward to it.
I wanted to like it.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.600
I got in it,
I didn't like it.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.040
-But it doesn't matter
because I do.
-You are wrong.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.600
-I'm not wrong.
-You are.

12:15.640 --> 12:19.080
JEREMY:
Eventually, we stopped
arguing and set off...

12:19.120 --> 12:22.040
so we could do more arguing
on the move.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.800
(ENGINES ROARING)

12:24.840 --> 12:27.760
So, James,
Honda's hybrid technology

12:27.800 --> 12:31.440
has served them very well
in Formula One the last
couple of years, hasn't it?

12:31.480 --> 12:34.280
JAMES: Has it? I wouldn't
know and I don't care.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.600
Formula One is irrelevant.

12:36.640 --> 12:39.920
And then there are
actual details
that are wrong with that car.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.800
Yes, go on.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.240
Well, the gearbox
is dim-witted,
the steering's odd,

12:45.280 --> 12:47.960
the sun visor's too flimsy,
the satnav's from a Civic,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.560
and the fuel gauge
isn't straight.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.760
What do you mean, the
fuel gauge isn't straight?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.360
You look at
the actual needle.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.000
It's not in the centre
of the dial.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.440
-Yes, it is.
-It isn't.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.440
The actual centre point
of the needle

13:04.480 --> 13:07.640
is higher up
than the middle of the dial.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.560
No, it isn't. The problem is,
when you're driving,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.800
your head, which is too big,
is in the wrong place.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.400
JEREMY: Isn't.
It's on top of my shoulders.
-Oh, God.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.200
If you got
a measuring tape out -

13:18.240 --> 13:20.520
and I'm sure you will,
cos you're that sort of man.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.280
I don't need to get
a tape measure out.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.120
I have a very good eye
for these things
and I can tell you it is.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.120
Welcome to Radio Old.

13:27.160 --> 13:31.560
I think the problem is the
needle boss is slightly proud
of the centre of the dial -

13:31.600 --> 13:33.440
because your head's in
the wrong place.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.400
Coming up next, we moan
about the price of things

13:36.440 --> 13:38.960
and how young policemen
are these days.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.440
Nyeh.

13:40.480 --> 13:44.960
JAMES: There's nothing wrong
with the fuel gauge. What
a ridiculous thing to say!

13:45.000 --> 13:47.840
JEREMY: It's so good
to be back doing what we do.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.440
Driving round corners
a bit too quickly

13:50.480 --> 13:52.160
while shouting and bickering.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.840
JEREMY: Sadly,
however, things took
a turn for the worse

13:59.880 --> 14:01.680
when we arrived
at the hotel

14:01.720 --> 14:04.200
that Hammond had booked.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.600
Here we go.
This is our home.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.320
This is gonna be great.

14:13.640 --> 14:15.080
What?

14:19.160 --> 14:21.720
(NONCHALANT WHISTLING)

14:21.760 --> 14:23.920
JEREMY: Hammond.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.520
What is
a "wellness retreat"?

14:26.560 --> 14:28.120
One of these.

14:28.160 --> 14:34.240
More specifically, hang on,
it said Swiss natural detox.
What is that?

14:34.280 --> 14:37.080
-It's handy for
where we need to be.
-Can we get a drink here?

14:37.120 --> 14:39.080
No.

14:39.120 --> 14:41.040
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.600
Do you realise that could
result in your death?

14:43.640 --> 14:44.760
-"Could"?
-Yes.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.400
Sorry, will.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.520
-What are you
thinking of?
-Why?

14:48.560 --> 14:51.480
It's convenient.
It's near many things
I want to be near.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.000
-It's the only hotel?
-Do they do colonic here?
-Yes.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.400
Would you like to know
what colonic feels like?

14:56.440 --> 14:59.080
-The new electric version.
-Do they really
do colonic here?

14:59.120 --> 15:01.080
-You might
feel better for it.
-I won't feel better for it!

15:01.120 --> 15:02.760
You'll thank me for it
in a bit.

15:02.800 --> 15:05.280
Would you like a glass of
water, James, and some kale?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.640
Oh, yes, that's what I
always have for supper.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.560
JEREMY: Over dinner that
night, the mood was dark.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.160
(BIRDSONG)

15:24.920 --> 15:27.600
I know people
who eat this stuff.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.080
Do you know
what they're called?

15:29.120 --> 15:30.640
Women.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.920
Think how healthy you'll feel
when we get back.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.160
-How long
are we here for?
-Four days.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.680
Four days?

15:38.720 --> 15:40.440
I've got a lot of things
planned.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.960
-Yeah, but we're gonna
starve to death, Hammond.
-No, you won't.

15:43.000 --> 15:47.480
Listen, what this is...
is tough love.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.840
Well, not love for you two,
but it's what you need.

15:49.880 --> 15:53.240
It's tougher hate than usual
is what I'm giving you.

15:53.280 --> 15:56.280
I'm taking you in hand
and for both of your sakes,

15:56.320 --> 15:59.200
turning it around,
turning over a new leaf.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.680
I actually think James
is looking better already.

16:01.720 --> 16:04.000
-He's got a healthy glow.
-He isn't looking better.
He's looking angrier.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.640
You're gonna look
a lot worse in a minute,
I can guarantee that.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.200
RICHARD: Look at the view.
Look at that. Look at that.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.240
JEREMY: You can't eat that!

16:12.280 --> 16:14.200
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:14.240 --> 16:16.400
Ungrateful sod!

16:16.440 --> 16:19.720
OK, we will pick that up
later on.

16:19.760 --> 16:21.760
Yes. And now it's time for us

16:21.800 --> 16:26.360
to take a stroll down
the smooth sidewalks
of Conversation Street.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.400
(LIVELY JAZZ)

16:28.440 --> 16:30.440
(INSECT BUZZING)

16:31.920 --> 16:34.040
-(CHEERING)
-That was good.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.120
Now, I'd like to begin
Conversation Street

16:40.160 --> 16:43.960
with the world's most
incompetent TV host,
James May,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.720
who filmed
the entire series...

16:46.760 --> 16:50.000
and as you saw in that sting,
the sting itself,

16:50.040 --> 16:52.920
and in the montage, and in
Switzerland, looking...

16:52.960 --> 16:56.360
Well, with long hair,
looking like a roadie
for Steppenwolf.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.520
And then he turned up
this morning

16:58.560 --> 17:00.160
looking like
a geography teacher.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.440
(LAUGHTER)

17:01.480 --> 17:04.680
James, have you ever heard of
the concept of continuity?

17:04.720 --> 17:06.440
He had to do it,
had to make a change,

17:06.480 --> 17:08.480
because he had
his identity stolen.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.160
I did, actually.
That is absolutely true.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.720
I did have
my identity stolen.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.000
Somebody got hold of,
you know, personal details,

17:14.040 --> 17:16.120
address and date of birth,
and they've opened, you know,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.320
eight bank accounts
with overdrafts and loans

17:18.360 --> 17:20.000
and all that stuff
that I'd be liable for.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.160
What fascinates me about this
is they had a choice.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.280
They could've been David
Beckham or Brad Pitt.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.640
Yeah, you can look
around the world. Anybody.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.440
I wanna be Barack Obama.
Cool, powerful.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.920
No, wait a minute.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.680
I want to live in Hammersmith
and have a folding bicycle

17:34.720 --> 17:36.640
so that one day,
I can walk out of my house

17:36.680 --> 17:40.680
and say, "Look at me. Behold,
I have become James May."

17:40.720 --> 17:41.920
(LAUGHTER)

17:41.960 --> 17:44.840
"And now I will organise
your paperclips.
Have you got a pie?"

17:44.880 --> 17:46.960
The good thing is, James...

17:47.000 --> 17:50.120
is we can guarantee this will
never happen to you again.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.520
-Can you?
-Yes.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.400
Because we have come up
with a new name for you.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.720
Yeah. You are now...

17:56.760 --> 17:58.280
Dingleberry Handpump.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.720
-(LAUGHTER)
-Right.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.600
That is your name,
your new identity.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.640
Nobody's gonna steal that
cos nobody's gonna go into
a mobile phone shop and say,

18:04.680 --> 18:07.520
"I'd like to set up an
account. My name is
Dingleberry Handpump."

18:07.560 --> 18:09.440
-Yes.
-You're completely safe.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.320
It's just that
that's now your name.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.080
-I appreciate that.
-That's OK.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.960
We're moving on
with an apology.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.520
And it's for the lateness of
the arrival of this series.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.680
The problem is that since
we were last here,

18:19.720 --> 18:23.480
all three of us,
for one reason or another,
have been in hospital.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.680
Uh, Handpump was in for...

18:25.720 --> 18:26.880
(LAUGHTER)

18:26.920 --> 18:28.760
I don't know why he was in.
But he was.

18:28.800 --> 18:32.640
Hammond, well,
we'll see why later.
And then I had pneumonia.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.280
-Um, this pneumonia
of yours.
-Yes.

18:35.320 --> 18:39.160
It's something that people
catch from... going out
without your vest on.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.400
-That's what I was told.
-Yes, my mum used to say,

18:41.440 --> 18:43.720
you'd get it if you went out
with wet hair.

18:43.760 --> 18:47.400
Yeah, that sort of thing.
And yet, you somehow managed
to catch pneumonia...

18:47.440 --> 18:50.920
on the sun-kissed
Mediterranean isle
of Majorca.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.120
-Yes, I did. I did.
-(LAUGHTER)

18:53.160 --> 18:55.760
It's very odd, because he was
out there for five weeks.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.400
He rang us after one,
and he said,

18:57.440 --> 18:59.960
"I can't come home.
I've literally got
pneumonia."

19:00.000 --> 19:01.680
-I had.
-And I looked it up.

19:01.720 --> 19:04.240
It was 100 degrees
and bone dry.

19:04.280 --> 19:06.440
-And yet you got pneumonia.
-I did catch pneumonia.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.280
After a short while,
if I remember right,

19:08.320 --> 19:10.760
-you managed to
get yourself to Ibiza.
-Yes, I did.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.960
I don't remember
a news headline
in the papers that said,

19:13.000 --> 19:16.160
"Jeremy Clarkson rushed
to Ibiza with pneumonia."

19:16.200 --> 19:18.640
No, I know I wasn't rushed.
I went on a friend's boat.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.640
"Sadly, Jeremy Clarkson
has been admitted
to a luxury yacht..."

19:21.680 --> 19:23.400
(LAUGHTER)

19:23.440 --> 19:27.040
-This pneumonia of yours
that you suffered from.
-Yes? Yes.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.800
Was it at its worst in the
morning when you woke up?

19:29.840 --> 19:33.200
And then did it get better
through the day, every day,

19:33.240 --> 19:35.120
towards the evening,
every day?

19:35.160 --> 19:37.440
It was pneumonia,
for crying out loud!

19:37.480 --> 19:39.200
You're mocking the afflicted.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.200
OK, Handpump, why don't you
tell the ladies and gentlemen
why you were in hospital?

19:43.240 --> 19:47.080
No, I don't like
to make a fuss.
Let's talk about cars.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.760
It's nothing to do
with my anus.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.480
Let's just clear that up
in case...

19:51.520 --> 19:53.520
-Um...
-I've got some conversation.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.960
-What?
-Nissan has introduced

19:56.000 --> 19:59.720
some special seats
that record your sweat.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.360
-What?
-I've got a picture of them.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.320
Right, they start blue.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.400
And then they go yellow
where you've been sweating.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.720
Why would you want seats
that do that?

20:08.760 --> 20:11.520
-That's a very,
very good question
-It's the only question.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.400
Yes. I looked into it.
Apparently, they say
it's because

20:14.440 --> 20:16.440
you can tell
when you're dehydrated,

20:16.480 --> 20:18.080
because you've
been sweating.

20:18.120 --> 20:19.840
I know when I'm dehydrated.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.080
It's because I feel thirsty
and I need a glass of wine.

20:23.120 --> 20:25.080
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHTER)

20:25.120 --> 20:28.760
-Well, be careful with that,
you'll get pneumonia again.
-That's how it starts.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.280
That's how it starts.
I know what you mean.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.280
Just don't applaud him.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.360
Handpump.

20:35.400 --> 20:37.320
That is the world's first...

20:37.360 --> 20:40.600
Nissan have come up
with the world's first
pneumonia-sensing car seats.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.520
That's absolutely incredible.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.560
I know what you mean.
Our bodies are equipped with

20:44.600 --> 20:47.360
means of telling us
that we are dehydrated
without looking at the seat.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.320
-Exactly. Exactly.
-Like if you start
going for a pee

20:50.360 --> 20:53.760
and just sand comes out,
it's time for some water.

20:53.800 --> 20:57.080
If you're one of those
sort of slightly fat
jogger type people,

20:57.120 --> 20:59.520
won't you end up with
like a yellow line

20:59.560 --> 21:01.400
where your butt crack was?

21:01.440 --> 21:03.560
Oh, how lovely!
How very lovely.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.440
Do you know the worst one
I ever had with that?

21:05.480 --> 21:08.640
I was filming
in the States, in Texas,
town called Lubbock.

21:08.680 --> 21:12.080
And I borrowed a pickup truck
from this quite large
gentleman.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.160
Um, who'd lent it.
We needed it for filming.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.880
Drove it around all day,
took it back to him
in the evening.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.560
He bent over to
pick something up,

21:18.600 --> 21:22.160
and as he did that, he'd got
his shirt not tucked in.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.280
As he bent over, I could see
he'd done his jeans up
under his arse.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.800
-What?
-Well, 'cause
he wasn't a well off man.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.440
He'd obviously bought
a pair of jeans
when he was 14

21:29.480 --> 21:31.280
and didn't fit them any more,
so he just simply...

21:31.320 --> 21:33.560
And I could see he hadn't
wiped his bottom.

21:33.600 --> 21:35.520
Oh, God! Jeremy!

21:35.560 --> 21:38.440
Who steers your eyes?
Why did you look there?

21:38.480 --> 21:40.680
-Because...
-Look away! Look away!

21:40.720 --> 21:42.880
It was a gigantic arse
with a brown...

21:42.920 --> 21:45.720
-I don't want to see
a man's claggy bottom.
-I didn't either.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.800
I especially didn't.
I'd spent all day

21:47.840 --> 21:50.760
squirming around in the seats
of his pickup truck.

21:50.800 --> 21:53.840
And I was wearing... I was
wearing beige trousers.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.760
-(LAUGHTER)
-That's all right.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.680
You could explain it
to people. It's not mine.
It's somebody else's.

21:58.720 --> 22:02.520
Exactly. I've got
somebody else's skid marks
on my trousers.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.040
It doesn't wash.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.000
Now, as we know, a lot of...

22:07.040 --> 22:08.920
particularly sporty cars
these days

22:08.960 --> 22:11.040
have got exhaust systems
that sort of make a racket

22:11.080 --> 22:13.480
when you put your foot down
or when you start them up.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.040
I had an Audi RS3
the other day.

22:15.080 --> 22:18.080
As you fired it up... (ROARS)

22:18.120 --> 22:20.280
-We're only going
to the shops for some milk.
-Makes a big fuss.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.240
Makes a huge
song and dance about it.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.320
Actually, some Jags
do this, don't they?

22:24.360 --> 22:26.200
-All the sporty ones do.
-Yeah, they do.

22:26.240 --> 22:29.200
They make a tremendous racket
but you don't hear it
inside the Jag.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.320
You can only hear it...
Basically, your neighbours
are annoyed by it but not you.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.480
Yes, and this is exactly
what I'm on about.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.200
Because Ford has announced
on the new Mustang,

22:37.240 --> 22:40.160
it's got something called
"Good Neighbour Mode".

22:40.200 --> 22:42.880
Ooh, does it come around
and water your plants
when you're on holiday?

22:42.920 --> 22:45.040
-Tell you you forgot to
take the cat in?
-No.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.440
-Bring your post in?
-No. It doesn't do
any of those things.

22:48.480 --> 22:51.080
But you can program the car
to start quietly

22:51.120 --> 22:52.880
between certain hours
of the day.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.160
So between, say, 11pm and 8am
it starts quietly.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.160
Ok? Because Ford's
head of noises--

22:58.200 --> 22:59.920
The what?

22:59.960 --> 23:03.600
No, he's American. It'll be
the Vice President of noises,
cos they always are.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.480
He's come up with a list of
other annoying sounds.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.640
Oh, where are you on it?
Come on, top, got to be.

23:08.680 --> 23:11.280
Gotta be. Right at the top.
Number one.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.720
That's actually
a good point.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.440
What are the most annoying
noises in the world?

23:15.480 --> 23:17.640
Oh, good conversation,
I like that.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.040
-What are they?
-Aircraft.

23:19.080 --> 23:20.600
-What?
-Cat fighting.

23:20.640 --> 23:22.120
-Cat fighting.
-I like that.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.840
-Donald Trump.
-(LAUGHTER)

23:23.880 --> 23:25.360
-Foxes shagging.
-What?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.760
-What?
-(LAUGHTER)

23:26.800 --> 23:28.520
Whoa!

23:28.560 --> 23:30.080
So, who was shagging?

23:30.120 --> 23:31.560
-Foxes shagging.
-Foxes--

23:31.600 --> 23:33.200
No, he's right.
That is annoying.

23:33.240 --> 23:35.240
-Foxes make a lot of noise.
-Do you know why?

23:35.280 --> 23:37.200
This is broadcast in America.

23:37.240 --> 23:39.640
They don't know...
(QUIETLY) ...what shagging
is.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.920
We know what shagging is.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.040
-Making love.
-Getting it on.

23:44.080 --> 23:47.520
Making little foxes,
for our American viewers.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.560
I have to be honest. Mine
is an old-fashioned one.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.760
-Polystyrene.
Anyone share that one?
-Yeah.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.480
Polystyrene doesn't make
a noise.

23:53.520 --> 23:54.880
It does, it squeaks.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.280
My children bought me
one of those record players,

23:57.320 --> 23:59.720
to digitise vinyl.
You know the one I mean.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.840
To transfer your records
into digital files.

24:01.880 --> 24:04.720
I can't get it out of the box
cos it's covered
in polystyrene.

24:04.760 --> 24:05.920
It's just sitting there.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.680
-So your kids
bought you this?
-Yes.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.800
-And you haven't
taken it out of the box.
-No.

24:09.840 --> 24:11.360
BOTH: You ungrateful bastard.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.960
-(LAUGHTER)
-Did you hear that?
It was like stereo.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.680
(APPLAUSE)

24:15.720 --> 24:18.360
I mean, that's your dad.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.960
He wouldn't even
take it out of the box.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.400
Your secret's out of the box
now, unlike your present
that they bought you.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.360
That is the end
of Conversation Street.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.880
We must now move on.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.400
In fact, we must move back
to our film.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.120
Tonight we are comparing
the superb

24:33.160 --> 24:35.800
Lamborghini Aventador S,

24:35.840 --> 24:39.040
the Honda NSX -
which is a hybrid
and has a wonky fuel gauge--

24:39.080 --> 24:40.720
No, it doesn't.
It's not wonky.

24:40.760 --> 24:44.120
...and the Rimac,
which is an all-electric
Croatian supercar.

24:44.160 --> 24:47.240
It's our comparison
between the past,
the present, and the future.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.080
Yeah, the only trouble
with this

24:49.120 --> 24:51.120
is that we were staying
at a health farm,

24:51.160 --> 24:52.760
which Hammond had chosen,

24:52.800 --> 24:55.840
sticking to a schedule
that he'd dreamt up.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.040
JAMES: Our first outing
was to a museum

25:10.080 --> 25:12.520
in the nearby city
of Lucerne.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
But that morning,
Jeremy and I

25:18.040 --> 25:20.360
had other things
on our minds.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.960
I'm starving already.
I think it's cos I only
had air for breakfast.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.360
JEREMY: I had
a piece of dry toast.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.840
RICHARD: Stop bleating
and just enjoy the view.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.640
Look around you.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.120
Ah.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.880
(SIGHS)

25:57.200 --> 25:58.600
Brilliant.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.160
JEREMY: Obviously something's
gone wrong here, hasn't it?

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
(WHIRRING)

26:09.760 --> 26:11.240
Where's he going?

26:12.480 --> 26:14.080
W...

26:15.200 --> 26:16.720
It's actually shut.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.720
It's roadworks, I think.

26:18.760 --> 26:20.560
We'll have to back up.

26:20.600 --> 26:24.320
So they are prepared to let
you sit here at a red light
until you starve to death.

26:24.360 --> 26:28.920
Why don't they just tell you
it's shut? A bit un-Swiss.

26:28.960 --> 26:32.240
RICHARD: Right, there is
an escape road to the side.
It's the old route, I think.

26:32.280 --> 26:35.560
If we back up until I can see
it, then we'll go down there.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.800
JEREMY:
Once we'd all backed up,

26:38.840 --> 26:41.400
we turned onto
Hammond's back road.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.600
Which was in a gorge.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.160
(SCRAPING)

26:49.520 --> 26:52.560
Yep, this is... Oh, yeah.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.360
Well done, Hammond,
you blithering idiot.

26:56.720 --> 26:57.920
(SCRAPING)

26:59.440 --> 27:00.920
Well, Hammond,
I've got to say

27:00.960 --> 27:03.680
I'm glad Honda spent
so much time and effort

27:03.720 --> 27:05.320
working on
the dynamics of this car

27:05.360 --> 27:09.440
so I could enjoy this
supercar extravaganza
you've brought me on.

27:09.480 --> 27:12.360
You have excelled yourself
in ruining my day.

27:12.400 --> 27:13.840
Oh, good.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.800
You've brought us
to a builder's yard, Hammond.

27:16.840 --> 27:18.480
There are lavatories
on the left

27:18.520 --> 27:22.080
if anybody wishes
to use them.

27:22.120 --> 27:26.040
JEREMY: Why?
Why did we allow him
to bring us to Switzerland?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.920
Why did we allow him
to put himself in charge?

27:31.000 --> 27:32.760
There we go.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.960
Back on the main road.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.200
JEREMY:
Unless, that is, you're me...

27:38.240 --> 27:39.840
in a Lamborghini.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.960
-Oh... Argh.
-(SCRAPING)

27:42.000 --> 27:44.200
(SCRAPING)

27:48.880 --> 27:50.360
-(SCRAPING)
-Ugh!

27:50.400 --> 27:52.720
Hammond! Hammond!

27:52.760 --> 27:54.760
Where are you?
I'm going to kill you!

27:57.520 --> 27:59.960
This thing is
deeply impressive.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.440
James, I've dialled up
my regenerative braking
with the throttle,

28:03.480 --> 28:05.200
so that I lift off
the accelerator,

28:05.240 --> 28:07.800
I don't even have to
touch the brake to stop.

28:07.840 --> 28:10.600
Wow. Can't stand
his resolute chirpiness

28:10.640 --> 28:14.960
in the face of obvious
disaster of his making.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.920
JEREMY: I, meanwhile,
had extricated myself

28:17.960 --> 28:21.840
from Hammond's gorge and was
now causing traffic chaos...

28:21.880 --> 28:23.560
-(HORN TOOTS)
-Sorry.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.080
Shit.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.520
...by having to do
a three-point turn.

28:28.560 --> 28:31.920
-(HORN BLARES)
-Sorry.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.520
-(HORN TOOTS)
-Sorry. I do apologise.

28:39.560 --> 28:42.640
JEREMY: Having not enjoyed
our supercars all morning,

28:42.680 --> 28:44.760
we soon arrived in Lucerne,

28:44.800 --> 28:48.000
with our irritating
tour guide leading the way.

28:50.480 --> 28:52.400
RICHARD: Hey, chaps,
they're electric trams.

28:52.440 --> 28:56.200
If I had a long enough
aerial, could I connect to
the wires and power this?

28:56.240 --> 28:58.120
JEREMY: Why don't you just
reach out and hold onto them?

28:58.160 --> 29:02.480
You would conduct the
electricity, wouldn't you?

29:02.520 --> 29:06.760
JEREMY: Hammond then said
that the best way
of getting to the museum

29:06.800 --> 29:10.920
was by driving right through
the medieval heart
of the city.

29:12.560 --> 29:16.280
Wasn't there a ring road
we could've used?

29:16.320 --> 29:18.720
Oh, ring roads are boring.
And further.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.640
JEREMY: I'm really getting
the best out of this car here

29:21.680 --> 29:25.680
in this town that Hammond's
bringing us through.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.840
JAMES: Hammond,
this is a cobbled street.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.400
I'm in a supercar
on a cobbled street.

29:30.440 --> 29:32.640
Well, it's a road.
It's a beautiful road

29:32.680 --> 29:34.880
through this ancient
and wonderful city.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.280
I didn't wanna look at an
ancient and wonderful city.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.040
I'd do that on a bicycle,
you pillock.

29:40.080 --> 29:44.000
JAMES: Then,
things got worse.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.280
RICHARD:
Uh, chaps, it's right here.

29:46.320 --> 29:48.960
JEREMY: You sure?
-Oh, this does look a bit...

29:51.920 --> 29:54.080
Yeah, we'll be all right.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.920
Oh, I don't like this.

29:58.960 --> 30:03.040
"Come to Switzerland
and drive the new NSX,"
said Hammond.

30:03.080 --> 30:06.240
This Lamborghini's four
inches wider than that Honda

30:06.280 --> 30:10.680
and five inches wider
than the lady shaver.

30:10.720 --> 30:14.800
I am never ever ever going to
get round that corner.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.160
JEREMY: And sure enough...

30:26.360 --> 30:29.000
A tiny bit of left hand
and just creep forward
so I can see.

30:29.040 --> 30:32.160
You can't creep.
It's a single clutch gearbox.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.840
Instead of giving this model
40 more horsepower,

30:34.880 --> 30:37.120
I'd have given it
a "one more clutch".

30:37.160 --> 30:39.480
No, I'd agree.
Does that fold?

30:39.520 --> 30:41.440
It doesn't matter.
Even if it does,

30:41.480 --> 30:43.640
the back of the car
is wider than the front.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.680
I'm going to have to find
another...

30:45.720 --> 30:47.920
It physically won't fit
through there.

30:47.960 --> 30:53.320
All right, well,
we're up there.
See you in a couple of weeks.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.600
JEREMY: So, while James
went off to not enjoy
his NSX some more...

30:57.640 --> 31:01.080
JAMES: Have you got any idea
what you're doing
and where you're going?

31:01.120 --> 31:03.680
RICHARD: It's down here,
this pretty little alley
here.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.200
...I spent a couple of hours

31:05.240 --> 31:08.000
on the verge of
a massive coronary.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.400
Jesus H.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
God, give me strength.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.400
Hammond!

31:22.520 --> 31:24.040
Sorry.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.240
Sorry.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.880
Sorry.

31:30.440 --> 31:32.440
JAMES: Meanwhile...

31:32.480 --> 31:35.000
Or do you have a bread roll?
I'm starving.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.120
-I need to eat. Eat.
-Ah.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.400
I'm so hungry. Yes.

31:39.440 --> 31:42.080
Danke. Danke, danke, danke.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.880
Oh.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.640
Mm-mm. What are these?

31:45.680 --> 31:48.000
It's bloody Ryvita.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.360
JEREMY: Eventually,
while I was attempting

31:50.400 --> 31:52.920
yet another
impossible manoeuvre,

31:52.960 --> 31:55.120
Hammond and May arrived.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.240
Well...

31:57.280 --> 32:00.320
-(CLATTERING)
-Oh, no.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.600
That's not good. Sorry.

32:03.640 --> 32:06.520
And then after a short drive
through suburbia,

32:06.560 --> 32:08.800
where none of us
got past 40,

32:08.840 --> 32:11.040
we arrived at
our destination.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.800
It was a transport museum.

32:14.840 --> 32:16.880
And once Hammond
had plugged his lady shaver

32:16.920 --> 32:19.920
into one of Switzerland's
fast charging points...

32:22.040 --> 32:26.600
...we went inside
to look at the rather
underwhelming exhibits.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.640
So let me just see
if I've got this straight.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.920
You made me - well, us -

32:34.960 --> 32:38.000
drive through a gorge
and the 12th century,

32:38.040 --> 32:40.320
so we can look at
a Renault 16?

32:40.360 --> 32:42.240
No, no, this is
so much more than that.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.280
There's all the things
on the racks here, and
then there's pictures here.

32:45.320 --> 32:47.800
You look for the picture
of the thing that you
wanna look at.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.360
Then you touch it.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.360
And now look
what happens.

32:51.400 --> 32:54.240
(WHIRRING)

32:56.480 --> 32:57.960
It's presented to you!

33:01.720 --> 33:03.560
JEREMY: I can only
apologise for this.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.560
I know you want to see
which of our three cars
is the fastest,

33:06.600 --> 33:09.480
which handles the best,
which is the most economical.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.160
JAMES: Oh, my God,
it's coming towards us.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.440
RICHARD: Yeah.

33:13.480 --> 33:15.560
What we're actually
looking at instead

33:15.600 --> 33:17.920
is a vending machine.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.280
With some old motorcycles on.

33:20.320 --> 33:23.080
-Oh, look, come on.
-Oh, wow, it goes
round and round.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.000
That is just the best.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.480
Give me strength.

33:28.520 --> 33:32.080
(WHIRRING)

33:32.120 --> 33:36.360
JEREMY: That night,
over dinner, the mood
was even darker.

33:38.120 --> 33:40.120
(BIRDSONG)

33:46.440 --> 33:49.280
And the following day,
it didn't improve

33:49.320 --> 33:52.960
because Hammond made us
go on exactly the same route

33:53.000 --> 33:54.480
as he had the day before.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.280
We did this yesterday.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.520
We did this as well
yesterday.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.840
And after Hammond
had plugged his car into

34:04.880 --> 34:07.200
the same charging point...

34:07.240 --> 34:11.640
we went off
to look at that day's
underwhelming attraction.

34:11.680 --> 34:14.120
The Museum of Chess.

34:18.080 --> 34:20.320
(TAPPING)

34:21.360 --> 34:23.800
Boom! I win!

34:23.840 --> 34:25.560
He doesn't even know
how to play, does he?

34:25.600 --> 34:28.040
And then the penny dropped.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.560
-Hammond.
-What?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.120
What are we doing tomorrow?

34:31.160 --> 34:33.440
Going to a pencil museum.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.520
Is the pencil museum in
the same town as this museum?

34:37.560 --> 34:38.680
Yes.

34:38.720 --> 34:41.040
Do you keep
bringing us to this town

34:41.080 --> 34:45.800
because it's the only one
within 100 miles of
our wellness centre

34:45.840 --> 34:49.720
where there is a fast
charging point for your car?

34:52.280 --> 34:54.800
Yes.

34:54.840 --> 34:57.920
JEREMY: So that night,
after another plate of weeds,

34:57.960 --> 35:01.000
James and I sacked Hammond
as team leader

35:01.040 --> 35:03.520
and came up with
our own schedule.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.480
(ENGINE PURRS)

35:19.240 --> 35:20.880
Right, we've found
an airfield,

35:20.920 --> 35:23.120
and now we're gonna have
a drag race,

35:23.160 --> 35:26.800
which is
a lot more interesting
than going to a museum.

35:28.320 --> 35:30.760
I'd have thought
he'd like museums.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.280
I mean, he's driving one.

RICHARD:
I've put it in launch,

35:41.680 --> 35:45.240
which sets the rear
two engines in the first
of their two gears.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.360
The front two engines
only have one gear.

35:47.400 --> 35:49.160
I do not know how that works.

35:49.200 --> 35:52.560
Why doesn't the car stretch
or overtake itself?

35:54.360 --> 35:56.120
The simple fact of
the matter is that

35:56.160 --> 35:59.160
because this car has
no electrical gubbins,

35:59.200 --> 36:03.600
it is, despite appearances,
the lightest car here.

36:03.640 --> 36:06.800
And it has 730 horsepower.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.640
So allow me, please,
to demonstrate

36:08.680 --> 36:12.040

dinosaur had been humiliated,

I decided to show Hammond

37:38.000 --> 37:39.920
that it still has
enough power

to kick-start a dying star.

-by the heart of the monster.
-It has.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.320
Do you know, the thing was,

38:15.360 --> 38:18.240
the tyre pressure
warning light came on.

38:18.280 --> 38:21.040
-What could that have meant?
-Well, it meant that,
on this,

38:21.080 --> 38:24.240
it was specifically
telling me there was
a problem with this tyre.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.280

we'll get it fixed...

we ought to find a track.

in Switzerland, will you,
cos motor racing is banned.

-What do you mean banned?
-Oh, it is.

38:44.600 --> 38:49.320
1955 there was an accident
in France, at Le Mans.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.600
The Swiss banned motorsport.
It's still banned today.

something else. Something
that requires four tyres.

that Switzerland

banned motor racing
because of an accident
in another country.

Yeah, it's like Britain
banning railways

39:28.080 --> 39:30.520
because a train crashed
in India.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.640
Yeah, exactly. Or it's like
America invading Iraq

39:33.680 --> 39:37.280
because some
Saudi Arabians destroyed
the World Trade Center.

we can edit it out.

Look, um, we'll pick
that film up later on,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.440
but in the meantime
you may remember that
in the last series

39:50.480 --> 39:53.680
we had a feature
called Celebrity Brain Crash.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.560
Yes, but we're not
doing that any more

39:55.600 --> 39:57.280
because too many people died.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.800
Yeah, and also because
you all hated it.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.840
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yeah, that's the main reason.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.200
Everybody wrote to us
and said, "That's rubbish.
Stop doing it."

40:05.240 --> 40:06.560
Anyway, it doesn't matter,

40:06.600 --> 40:08.680
because we've come up with
another idea,

40:08.720 --> 40:11.560
a brand-new idea
and it is brilliant.

40:11.600 --> 40:15.360
You see, the main
reason why we like
having the tent here--

40:15.400 --> 40:17.120
Is that you can walk home
every week.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.680
Yes, it's just that right
down the road,

40:18.720 --> 40:21.720
and I mean less than
a mile away,
there is an actual track.

40:21.760 --> 40:24.600
Yes, there is, and we've got
a picture of it here.
Have a look.

40:24.640 --> 40:29.080
It's rather fabulous because
as you can see, it's really
quite narrow, all of it,

40:29.120 --> 40:31.720
and then bits of it aren't
finished - this stretch.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.440
Yeah, that bit
is entirely gravel.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.360
Yes, it is,
but it doesn't matter
because it is a circuit.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.160
And then somebody said to us,
"Well, why don't you
get a celebrity

40:39.200 --> 40:42.200
to drive round it every week
to see which is the fastest."

40:42.240 --> 40:44.080

-We said no,
because that would be boring.
-Yeah.

40:47.000 --> 40:50.960
So we have come up with
an entirely new idea.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.080
You see, everybody's always
wanting to know

40:53.120 --> 40:55.920
who is the fastest
weathergirl
in the world,

40:55.960 --> 41:00.280
or who is
the world's fastest
transgender architect.

41:00.320 --> 41:01.920
-Exactly.

from the same field

calling Celebrity Face Off.

41:15.560 --> 41:18.880

Celebrity F Off--
No, that doesn't work.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.240
which is a series,
in Yorkshire,

43:10.280 --> 43:11.760
and we had a blast.

extremely nice.

but we're both
from Yorkshire.

Oh, don't pile on
the pressure.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.760
Can I just ask, what did you
think of our track?

43:28.800 --> 43:30.400
It's incredible. I mean...

43:30.440 --> 43:32.960
Hopefully, you know,
when you film people...

43:33.000 --> 43:35.040
like I've filmed friends
going round tracks

43:35.080 --> 43:36.640
and they go,
"Oh, film me, film me!"

43:36.680 --> 43:40.080
You don't wanna watch it back
cos they come round
the corner like brrrrrrrr.

43:40.120 --> 43:42.720
But we were going sideways
at points on this.

43:42.760 --> 43:45.080
-What about the car? The Jag.
-Loved it.

43:45.120 --> 43:48.160
-I loved it, Jaguar.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.240
There's a man
who understands sponsorship.

43:50.280 --> 43:51.720
Yeah, exactly.

43:51.760 --> 43:52.960
I would have thought
your biggest problem

43:53.000 --> 43:55.040
was getting in it,
cos I really struggle.

43:55.080 --> 43:57.800
-I couldn't get in the car,
Jeremy.
-Could you not?

43:57.840 --> 44:01.160
No, I had a hard time
getting into KITT,
but you know, this was...

44:01.200 --> 44:03.240
Actually,
we've got some footage.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.320

of the Hoff trying to get
into our Jag?

-Let's have
a quick look at that.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.920
There it is.
Look. Resplendent.

44:10.960 --> 44:12.760
And it's got
a roll cage in it.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.440
-And this is the bit--
-Oh, my God.

44:17.480 --> 44:20.360
The bit I like here is -
I've had to do this as well -

44:20.400 --> 44:22.800
is when you have to lift your
own leg.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.440
-Argh! Argh!
-(LAUGHTER)

44:25.480 --> 44:29.640

44:31.200 --> 44:34.760
-And even like the colour.
-Yeah, yeah.

44:34.800 --> 44:39.160
Your biggest problem,
though, as I understand it,
with cars,

44:39.200 --> 44:40.600
is being run over by them.

44:40.640 --> 44:44.200
Oh, yeah, cos I actually
got run over, then tried
to chase after the car.

44:44.240 --> 44:46.880
-You never caught the guy?
-They never caught the guy.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.920
How come they can
catch me doing 35 in a 30,
but they can't catch...

44:49.960 --> 44:51.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.720
It's a very good point.

44:53.760 --> 44:57.640
Um, in fact, when er...

44:57.680 --> 45:00.840
In fact, when the police
questioned me about it,

45:00.880 --> 45:05.160
"So, what was the car like?"
and I said it was a Metro
and it had a sunroof.

45:05.200 --> 45:09.440
They said, "How do you know
it had a sunroof?" "Cos
I went over the sunroof."

45:09.480 --> 45:11.320
Good observation while
you're being run over.

45:11.360 --> 45:14.000
"And it's a Tudor Webasto
sunroof."

45:14.040 --> 45:15.880
I'm actually surprised,
though,

45:15.920 --> 45:18.480
you did survive
your motoring youth, Hoff.

45:18.520 --> 45:20.640
Yeah, my first car was um...

45:20.680 --> 45:22.840
when I was just turning 16,

45:22.880 --> 45:25.880
was a Corvair,
which is a real small car.

45:25.920 --> 45:27.920
Well, not by
European standards.

45:27.960 --> 45:30.360
-We call it an enormous car.
-Yeah.

45:30.400 --> 45:34.280
The engine was in the back
and it was described as
"unsafe at any speed".

45:34.320 --> 45:36.080
(LAUGHTER)

45:36.120 --> 45:39.480
-I just realise that now.
-(LAUGHTER)

45:39.520 --> 45:41.040
Your first car
was a Fiat Panda.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.400
-Yeah, if you want
an example of a small...
-Oh, my God.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.840
-If you want an example
of a small car...
a Fiat Panda is what you...

45:46.880 --> 45:49.440
It'd be like you trying to
get into a cupboard
under the stairs.

45:49.480 --> 45:51.040
-It was called a what?
-A Panda.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.200
-A Panda?
-Yeah.

45:53.240 --> 45:56.240
They're very rare now,
like Pandas.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.600
-Didn't you have people
steal the windscreen?
-Yeah.

45:58.640 --> 46:01.280
They have a peculiar thing,
the Panda.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.200
-It has a very flat--
-Completely flat.

46:03.240 --> 46:06.560
Completely flat, and you
used to be able to pop
it out, from the outside.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.280
So, many times
I'd get into it

46:08.320 --> 46:11.960
and be driving down the road
and go, "Something's wrong."

46:12.000 --> 46:14.080
-(LAUGHTER)
-Like that.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.400
You wouldn't even get that
fast, so you'd never know.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.560
Yeah.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.720
It was only when you turned
the squirters on that it...

46:20.760 --> 46:23.280
-And that happened a lot?
-Well, it happened a few times.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.640
And then I kept buying them
out of this Italian guy

46:26.680 --> 46:28.320
that had a garage
round the corner.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.680
-I think he was nicking 'em.
-(LAUGHTER)

46:30.720 --> 46:34.280
"That's my tax disc."

46:34.320 --> 46:36.120
Now we've gotta
get onto KITT.

46:36.160 --> 46:39.480
We all remember Knight Rider
and the Trans Am.

46:39.520 --> 46:42.120
Thing is, I was looking the
other day, cos it's a while...

46:42.160 --> 46:44.960
-When was it actually on?
-It was on from '82 to '86.

46:45.000 --> 46:48.040
OK, '82 to '86. Now, it had,
in your car, you had cru...

46:48.080 --> 46:50.080
These were all
futuristic things.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.720
Cruise control, pollen
filters in the air con,

46:52.760 --> 46:55.920
vocal commands,
automatic opening doors.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.960
You get all that stuff
on a Ford Fiesta now.

46:58.000 --> 47:01.520
-(LAUGHTER)
-It's actually standard
on a Ford Fiesta.

47:01.560 --> 47:04.040
It still really did
capture the imagination.

47:04.080 --> 47:06.480
There was a Yorkshireman
who did an homage to KITT.

47:06.520 --> 47:07.640
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.520
-Got a picture of it here.
-It wasn't me.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.280
No, look.

47:11.320 --> 47:13.560
(LAUGHTER)

47:13.600 --> 47:16.880
-A, it's a Renault.
-It's not that bad.
It's not bad.

47:16.920 --> 47:19.000
-Formula One drivers have a--
-Exactly.

47:19.040 --> 47:21.000
-A stick like that.
-I see nothing wrong with that.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.240
But no, because...

47:22.280 --> 47:25.120
You've come up with
your rules of the road,
which I quite like.

47:25.160 --> 47:27.600
You've got one here.
Old people over a certain age

47:27.640 --> 47:30.920
should be legally required to
place a hat
on the parcel shelf.

47:30.960 --> 47:32.120
(LAUGHTER)

47:32.160 --> 47:34.760
Now, old people... Not so
much old people in general.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.200
I was gonna say be careful,
because if you say 65...

47:37.240 --> 47:40.520
-Yeah, that's me.
-No, I'm just saying...

47:40.560 --> 47:43.400
On certain journeys,
I'd like to put a hat
on the parcel shelf,

47:43.440 --> 47:45.720
just to indicate
that I'm not racing you.

47:45.760 --> 47:48.000
What I really like
is this business of um...

47:48.040 --> 47:51.040
male and female cyclists
should indicate
on their Lycra bottoms

47:51.080 --> 47:55.240
-what sex they are.
-Yeah, definitely. Yeah.

47:55.280 --> 47:57.320
-Well, I know...
-(APPLAUSE)

47:57.360 --> 47:59.520
I know where you're going
with that.

47:59.560 --> 48:01.360
(CHUCKLES LECHEROUSLY)

48:01.400 --> 48:02.800
(LAUGHTER)

48:02.840 --> 48:06.480
We've all been...
"Ooh, I say!
Oh, no, he's got a beard."

48:06.520 --> 48:08.240
(LAUGHTER)

48:08.280 --> 48:10.480
Now, I wanna get
on to your laps.

48:10.520 --> 48:12.960
-Oh.
-And I wanna start off,
if I may,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.840
-with you, your Hoffmeister.
-Oi.

48:15.880 --> 48:17.680
Are you a fast driver?

48:17.720 --> 48:22.120
You know, I um...
I'm basically an actor.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.280
You know, I'm not
really a good driver

48:24.320 --> 48:27.120
but I just look good
doing it.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.160
(LAUGHTER)

48:29.200 --> 48:32.280
Because we have some
footage of you attempting...

48:32.320 --> 48:36.400
I think it was your first one
and making a bit of a mess-up
of what is the last corner...

48:36.440 --> 48:38.720
-Right.
-And then really making
a mess-up of the finish.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.800
Let's have a look at this.

48:40.840 --> 48:44.240
Here he comes now, into the
last corner, goes in deep,

48:44.280 --> 48:46.560
which is crazy,
loses it on the grass

48:46.600 --> 48:49.040
and then there's
the finish line - and stops.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.560
(LAUGHTER)

48:54.120 --> 48:57.280
-We've never seen
that before.
-No...

48:57.320 --> 49:00.720
They told me
the first lap didn't count.

49:00.760 --> 49:03.880
-Yes.
-And that's why I didn't
hit the finish line.

49:03.920 --> 49:05.880
-We can edit out that excuse.
-Ah, come on!

49:05.920 --> 49:08.160
I love the idea of a Formula
One driver going...

49:08.200 --> 49:11.280
Well, that's it, and that's
as far as I'm going.

49:11.320 --> 49:13.200
-Am I? Yes.
-Anyway.

49:13.240 --> 49:16.680
Let's have a look at
the Hoff's lap.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.320
And we are off
on our brand-new track
in our brand-new car.

49:20.360 --> 49:22.640
Remember,
Knight Rider drove himself.

49:22.680 --> 49:23.800
(LAUGHS)

49:26.920 --> 49:30.720
Clipping the corner
but keeping two wheels
on the track, nice to see.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.120
And then you go left
and onto the gravel.

49:35.840 --> 49:38.200
This is what we call
the difficult bit.

49:38.240 --> 49:39.640
It is actually quite tricky

49:39.680 --> 49:42.120
as you flick it right there
and then flick it left.

49:42.160 --> 49:44.600
Now we're into - not the
Carousel - the Gravelsel.

49:47.400 --> 49:50.600
It's like a banked
gravel corner.

49:50.640 --> 49:52.720
Never been seen
anywhere before.

49:52.760 --> 49:54.560
(CHUCKLING)

49:54.600 --> 49:57.520
Into the difficult bit two.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.440
You're managing
to keep it mostly tidy,
which is quite good.

50:00.480 --> 50:04.080
I'm looking forward to seeing
Judi Dench go down here
one day - sideways.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.360
Ooh, deep again!

50:05.400 --> 50:08.120
Nearly stopped, but now
picking up the speed.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.960
And onto the main straight.

50:12.000 --> 50:14.120
This is one helluva track,
this.

50:17.520 --> 50:22.960
Hit it! Yeah! (YELLS)

50:23.000 --> 50:25.040
That was the sound
of a man crapping himself.

50:25.080 --> 50:27.800
And I don't think
you did actually lift,
which is brave.

50:27.840 --> 50:29.280
Now braking.

50:29.320 --> 50:31.440
Are we gonna get
the last corner right?

50:31.480 --> 50:33.640
Yes. All neatly done
and there we are.

50:33.680 --> 50:36.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
across the line!

50:36.160 --> 50:38.320
-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
-Well...

50:42.920 --> 50:46.520
That looked like
you were in control.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.160
-No, I... No.
-No, that was tidy.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.440
The slower you look,
very often the faster
you're going.

50:52.480 --> 50:54.440
-Yeah.
-I mean, that is a true fact.

50:54.480 --> 50:57.520
Yeah, if you go smooth
and keep the car on balance,
but it's hard to do.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.960
It is. I went out and had
a play on that this morning,

51:00.000 --> 51:02.360
and just had... the tail out
the entire way round.

51:02.400 --> 51:06.960
It's taken me 15 minutes to
get round here but I had fun
in the process. Anyway.

51:07.000 --> 51:08.600
-Can I use that as my excuse?
-No.

51:08.640 --> 51:11.880
We're gonna see your lap now.
OK, are we ready?

51:11.920 --> 51:14.480
Let's bring it up. Here
he is, Ricky Wilson's lap.

51:14.520 --> 51:17.120
RICKY:
Little bit further back
than you were.

51:17.160 --> 51:19.440
JEREMY: Nice excuse
and we haven't even started.

51:19.480 --> 51:21.880
Not even looking. No hands.
No hands. No hands.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.920
(LAUGHTER)

51:23.960 --> 51:25.080
(TYRES SCREECH)

51:25.120 --> 51:28.520
JEREMY:
Ooh, it's deep, deep, deep.
Getting it all together.

51:28.560 --> 51:29.920
But it's not bad
slowing down there

51:29.960 --> 51:31.960
cos you can
now keep the power on there,

51:32.000 --> 51:35.000
keep the power on here,
and onto the difficult bit.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.880
No, that's good. Gonna flick
the tail out a bit?

51:38.920 --> 51:41.200
Yeah, that's nice.
Flick it the other way.

51:41.240 --> 51:44.320
RICKY: I found that
made you go quicker,
flicking the tail out.

51:44.360 --> 51:48.000
Whoo-hoo! Take that!

51:48.040 --> 51:50.600
JEREMY:
This is good, round the
Gravelsel. Get that tail out.

51:50.640 --> 51:52.720
There it is.
We're gonna find out later

51:52.760 --> 51:55.560
whether that's faster
or slower than
the Hoff's approach.

51:55.600 --> 51:58.880
Cutting the corner.
That's not going to be grass
for very much longer.

51:58.920 --> 52:02.080
That's very good.
Very good indeed.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.800
Also, when you come back
to the Tarmac here,

52:03.840 --> 52:05.600
it's very, very slippery,
that bit.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.920
For reasons
I don't understand.

52:07.960 --> 52:10.480
(TYRES SCREECHING)

52:10.520 --> 52:12.840
Kicking dust off the tail.
Looks good, that car.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.680
And now,
onto the straight.

52:15.880 --> 52:19.400
Give it some. Come on, Jag.

52:19.440 --> 52:21.320
JEREMY: Did you lift here?
-Yes.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.560
(LAUGHTER)

52:23.600 --> 52:25.640
-I don't think you did.
-Ah, well, maybe not.

52:25.680 --> 52:28.000
-I don't think you did there.
-I was having too much
of a good time.

52:28.040 --> 52:31.480
Ooh, kick the tail out at the
last corner and there we are,
across the line.

52:31.520 --> 52:34.480
-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
-It looked all right.
It looked all right.

52:34.520 --> 52:38.120
-I'm a little nervous now.
-It looked all right.

52:38.160 --> 52:40.240
-Are you proud?
-Yeah, I am quite proud.

52:40.280 --> 52:41.880
-Proud of that.
-Yeah.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.360
Oh.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.760
Have I remembered to bring
the times out with me?

52:45.800 --> 52:47.680
-Oh, gosh.
-Yes, I have.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.440
I think it's you.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.840
I think it's you, cos you
looked more in control.

52:51.880 --> 52:53.440
I was all over the shop.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.440
Yeah, but no...
you were smooth.

52:55.480 --> 52:58.240
-And I stopped
at the first corner.
-(LAUGHTER)

52:58.280 --> 53:01.160
You did virtually stop,
that is true. You did
actually come to a halt.

53:01.200 --> 53:03.160
Mind you, you stopped
just before the finish line.

53:03.200 --> 53:05.440
-Yeah, yeah.
-(LAUGHTER)

53:05.480 --> 53:09.200
David Hasselhoff,
you did it...

53:09.240 --> 53:11.240
representing the United
States of America.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.440
-Oh, God.
-(LAUGHTER)

53:13.480 --> 53:15.080
One minute...

53:15.120 --> 53:16.760
24, point one.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.320
We have no idea
whether that's fastest.

53:19.360 --> 53:20.720
(APPLAUSE)

53:20.760 --> 53:24.240
-Yeah. It could be anything.
-Literally no idea.

53:24.280 --> 53:27.360
That could be
the fastest time

53:27.400 --> 53:29.800
we're ever, ever
going to see round here.

53:29.840 --> 53:32.120
-Right.
-Or it could be the slowest.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.040
-We have no idea.
-(LAUGHTER)

53:34.080 --> 53:36.280
-Ricky Wilson.
-Yeah, yeah.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.560
One minute...

53:39.600 --> 53:42.280
-...20...
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.760
...point one.

53:43.800 --> 53:45.880
-Whoo!
-(CHEERING)

53:46.960 --> 53:48.440
Whoo!

53:51.320 --> 53:54.080
Ohh!

53:54.120 --> 53:56.600
-I... Oh.
-Well, there we are.

53:56.640 --> 53:59.360
Well.

53:59.400 --> 54:02.040
So, there we are.
How do you feel about that?

54:02.080 --> 54:05.320
-I've spent years practising.
-(LAUGHTER)

54:05.360 --> 54:08.240
-I told you I was an actor.
-(LAUGHTER)

54:08.280 --> 54:09.560
(CLEARS THROAT)

54:09.600 --> 54:12.000
David Hasselhoff...
and, as it turns out,

54:12.040 --> 54:16.920
the fastest former
talent judge in the world,
Ricky Wilson!

54:16.960 --> 54:19.840
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

54:19.880 --> 54:21.520
Thank you, gentlemen.

54:26.200 --> 54:29.320
Right, let's get back
to Switzerland.

54:29.360 --> 54:31.800
When we left the action,
Jeremy had torn the tyre

54:31.840 --> 54:33.920
clean off his Lamborghini,

54:33.960 --> 54:37.000
and we thought
that would be it, as far as
accidents are concerned.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.240
Mm-hm, we figured that
because we are all

54:39.280 --> 54:41.200
experienced,
professional drivers,

54:41.240 --> 54:44.000
nothing else
could possibly go wrong.

54:44.040 --> 54:45.680
-(LAUGHTER)
-Exactly.

54:45.720 --> 54:48.080
So we pick up the story
at our wellness clinic,

54:48.120 --> 54:49.600
where we were

motor racing is banned.

for us that night.

always go to a museum.

55:15.920 --> 55:18.160
We need to go to
a race track, Hammond.

55:18.200 --> 55:21.880
Well, look, actually,
as we're in Switzerland...
Clarkson?

55:21.920 --> 55:24.280
-What?
-Can you do... Argh!

55:24.320 --> 55:27.640
Can you do hill climbs in
Switzerland under their laws?

55:27.680 --> 55:30.440
I don't know.
I've got a tube up my arse.

55:30.480 --> 55:31.720
Well, seriously,
you've been here before.

55:31.760 --> 55:34.840
You're supposedly
the motorsport expert,
you always say.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.880
JEREMY: I don't know.
I've got a tube up my arse.

55:37.920 --> 55:40.200
Yeah, but the thing
that they banned was...

55:40.240 --> 55:41.800
because in the famous
Le Mans crash,

55:41.840 --> 55:43.720
cars crashed into each other.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.920
That can't happen in a hill
climb, so would they allow
stuff against the clock?

55:46.960 --> 55:49.680
I don't know because I've
got a tube up my arse.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.600
Come on, think, Clarkson.

55:51.640 --> 55:54.840
JEREMY: I think you can do
hill climbing in Switzerland,

55:54.880 --> 55:58.160
but I don't know for sure
because I've got a tube
up my arse.

55:58.200 --> 56:00.560
Right. OK, that's a start.

Let's see if
we can find out... Argh!

56:08.240 --> 56:10.440
JEREMY: After a bit
of digging around,

56:10.480 --> 56:14.840
James discovered there was
a Swiss hill climb event
on that weekend...

56:14.880 --> 56:18.200
and it was only 200 miles
from our hotel.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.080

56:20.120 --> 56:22.160
Which was fine...
for some of us.

56:24.680 --> 56:28.000
At this speed, six of my 12

56:28.040 --> 56:30.080
They're not using
any fuel at all,

56:30.120 --> 56:34.640
so I could probably do
400 miles on the fuel I have.

56:36.040 --> 56:37.520
Just check on James.

56:37.560 --> 56:41.440
Er, James, are you able
to make the hill climb event
200 miles away?

56:41.480 --> 56:44.400
Well, let me just have a
look. Er, yes, I am.

56:44.440 --> 56:47.560

know with that fuel gauge?

56:47.600 --> 56:50.120

Oh, I can't be bothered.

the motorway miles on your
precious cars, are we? Good.

56:56.560 --> 56:59.560
Why is there somebody talking
to us from a van, James?

56:59.600 --> 57:01.280
It's a lorry!

57:01.320 --> 57:03.240
Hey, Hammond, I don't know
where you are, but there's

57:03.280 --> 57:06.400
a really remarkable-looking
futuristic car
on the back of a truck.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.600
Must just be a mock-up,
I suppose, otherwise it
would be being driven.

the miles on. Enjoy yourself!

what's wrong with this.

their race horses to
the Grand National, do they?

57:17.440 --> 57:19.480
They put them on a lorry.

to go hill climbing.

59:14.280 --> 59:16.480
But before we did
our timed runs,

we had to learn

in all of this

is my ability to concentrate
and remember how it goes.

that in timed runs,

1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:07.280
1:20.4.

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:08.960
-(BLEEPING)
-OK.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.720
Representing the past,
the Lamborghini Aventador

1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:14.960
did it in 1 minute 10.4.

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.640
AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Ooh!

1:07:16.680 --> 1:07:19.680
And this is the big one.
Representing the future...

1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:21.320
(LAUGHTER)

1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:23.960
...the Rimac did it in

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.560
one minute...14.7.

1:07:27.600 --> 1:07:29.480
Yes! I am the winner!

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:30.920
(APPLAUSE)

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:33.240
-Oh, I am victorious.
-No, wait! Wait a minute.

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:35.080
-(APPLAUSE)
-Wait a minute.

1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:39.200
-The past and me.
-You weren't even driving
the bloody car.

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.520
Well, you were driving
your car and you crashed it.

1:07:41.560 --> 1:07:45.760
Yes, but I crashed
after the finishing line,
like a professional.

1:07:45.800 --> 1:07:47.200
(LAUGHTER)

1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:48.960
Hammond,
when was the last time

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000
you went home after work
not in an air ambulance?

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:53.400
-(LAUGHTER)
-Now--

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:55.960
When was the last time
you took your own clothes
off at night,

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:58.120
rather than have a paramedic
cut them off in a field?

1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:00.840
-Now, hang on a minute.
-You crashed
after the finishing line,

1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:03.040
so our cameras weren't there.

1:08:03.080 --> 1:08:05.000
We had to get that clip
from YouTube.

1:08:05.040 --> 1:08:08.800
-That is not professional.
That is selfish. It is.
-Look...

1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:10.560
I just don't know
how it happened.

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.840
We do. We know
exactly how it happened.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:15.960
History has taught us
you can't drive
in a straight line.

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:18.360
And now we've seen you can't
drive round a corner either.

1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:21.480
Do you know what's
a really remarkable thing
about that crash?

1:08:21.520 --> 1:08:24.120
-What?
-That car continued
to catch fire

1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.640
five days after it happened.

1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:30.400
-Fi... What? Bursting into--
-Yeah. Spontaneously
bursting into flames.

1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:34.440
The reason is the accident
damaged one of the cells
in the lithium ion battery.

1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:36.600
That caused a short circuit,
it catches fire,

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.120
but then that damages
the next cell,

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:40.280
so that one catches fire,
and so it goes on.

1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:43.240
There are 8,000 cells
in that thing.

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:45.280
It's like a chain reaction.
What do they call it?

1:08:45.320 --> 1:08:47.320
Yeah, chain reaction.
It's called thermal runaways.

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:49.160
Bang, bang, bang, bang,
and so it goes on.

1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:51.160
-I was all right.
-(LAUGHTER)

1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:54.880
(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:57.600
Thank you.

1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:02.600
It's relevant. I'm OK.

1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:05.160
We don't care,
and anyway it's time
to end the programme

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:09.440
with a conclusion to our very
thorough test, and it's this.

1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:12.240
The future is very fast...

1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:15.680
and extremely quiet...
but a bit burney.

1:09:15.720 --> 1:09:16.920
(LAUGHTER)

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:19.160
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:21.240
Thank you so much
for watching. Goodbye.

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.280
(CHEERING)
