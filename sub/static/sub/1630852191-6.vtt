01:16.993 --> 01:18.119
Honey.

01:23.875 --> 01:24.876
Do you

01:26.586 --> 01:27.712
know me?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.386
I'm sorry.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.598
I thought we knew each other.

01:40.892 --> 01:44.187
I felt bad about not recognizing
those I'd met before,

01:44.938 --> 01:47.315
so I've gotten into the habit
of pretending to know.

01:56.783 --> 01:59.536
I'm sorry. I must've caused
this misunderstanding.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.669
Let's go inside.
I can't wait to see your work.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.963
-Let's go.
-Okay.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.849
<i>Where is Woo-jae?</i>

02:22.267 --> 02:24.394
The Woo-jae we used to know…

02:25.311 --> 02:27.063
He is long gone.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.735
That Woo-jae is dead.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.375
I couldn't believe it at first either.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.710
Gu Hae-won… No.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.423
Ms. Gu.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.801
What are you scheming--

02:56.885 --> 02:58.428
Country code 353.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.514
That was all I had,
so I searched all over Ireland.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.268
Meanwhile, Woo-jae was hospitalized.

03:05.935 --> 03:09.314
Thankfully, someone had been paying
for his hospital bills.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.943
Guess what I found
at the end of my digging?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.573
Taerim Academy's Social Service Team.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.707
Now, tell me.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.462
What happened to him?

03:56.819 --> 03:58.529
I'll be back. Look around first.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.530
Okay.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.090
Are you doing all right?

04:20.385 --> 04:26.641
Showing my work to others doesn't seem
to get easy with time.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.895
If it did, you wouldn't be able
to come up with such great work.

04:30.979 --> 04:34.941
Right. Have you two said hello yet?
She's Gu Hae-won.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.901
-She's Mr. Seo's--
-I know.

04:37.568 --> 04:38.695
Back in the day,

04:39.862 --> 04:42.198
I took drawing classes from them.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.201
You're her teacher?

04:46.077 --> 04:47.662
That's embarrassing to hear.

04:47.745 --> 04:51.374
She's become this successful
while I've just wasted my time.

04:54.502 --> 04:57.171
I heard his work is being received well.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.506
Have you sold any?

04:58.589 --> 05:00.300
Not yet.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.845
We don't plan on lowering the prices
of his first batch of work,

05:03.928 --> 05:05.722
so I'm afraid it'll take some time.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.015
Good thinking.

05:07.098 --> 05:09.642
To an artist,
money shouldn't come before their work.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.352
I agree.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.605
Excuse me.

05:17.775 --> 05:22.071
You can say such a thing
because your work sells well.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.868
Enjoy your time here

05:27.452 --> 05:28.953
although you're not welcome.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.044
You must not be interested in what I know.

06:04.947 --> 06:08.159
So was this what you meant
when you said he was dead?

06:17.251 --> 06:20.088
I didn't know you could call someone dead

06:20.922 --> 06:22.548
when they are alive and well.

06:23.674 --> 06:24.675
Sure.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.097
To me, he'd already been dead once.

06:39.732 --> 06:43.820
Were you startled?
I was just like you at first.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.617
What are you guys doing down there?

06:52.078 --> 06:54.163
Hey, we were just about to go up.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.501
Woo-jae, let's go home. I'm tired.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.191
Please?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.278
She's content
with the quality of your work.

08:07.361 --> 08:09.071
-Walk slowly.
-What do you think?

08:09.155 --> 08:11.574
I agree. They're marvelous.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.535
That's good news.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.455
Oh, thank you.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.665
You have nothing to worry about.

08:19.749 --> 08:22.543
She'll take great care of your work.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.551
What were you and Ms. Gu
talking about back there?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.053
What?

08:33.679 --> 08:36.182
About her husband.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.810
I didn't know he was also an artist.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.897
Did you?

08:43.731 --> 08:46.609
I didn't. I also didn't know
she'd come uninvited.

08:47.693 --> 08:48.778
You're right.

08:50.279 --> 08:54.492
I know she came because of her husband,
but she's got some nerve.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.536
She's really something.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.371
You call that being brazen.

08:58.454 --> 09:00.498
Why did you bother speaking with her?

09:01.165 --> 09:03.209
I was just curious.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.379
Her husband seemed a bit strange.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.798
I heard he had an accident.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.675
Have you heard the details?

09:12.134 --> 09:15.429
If you were that curious,
why didn't you ask Ms. Gu?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.271
Be careful.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.231
We can take the next U-turn. Slow down.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.748
What are you thinking about?

09:45.251 --> 09:46.794
Ms. Jeong's painting.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.770
Strangely,

10:05.521 --> 10:07.815
I could hear sounds.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.944
That's impossible.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.406
I'm serious. The sounds came
from the painting.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.489
SEDATIVES

11:08.626 --> 11:09.669
Thanks.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.505
What is it? What's wrong?

11:54.588 --> 11:55.589
It's nothing.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.676
I dropped these.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.346
Ho-su just went to bed.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.722
I'm sorry.

12:04.223 --> 12:07.518
The curator called.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.603
-Is she coming?
-Yes.

12:09.687 --> 12:14.483
Despite being a new gallery,
I'm sure she'd like to be in charge of it.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.444
She has excellent intuition.

12:16.527 --> 12:20.030
She writes the catalogs too.
She'll be quite helpful.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.991
I believe you.

12:23.617 --> 12:24.660
By the way,

12:25.661 --> 12:27.913
shouldn't you tell
the director in advance?

12:28.956 --> 12:32.293
She knows this is your last exhibition,
but I doubt she knows

12:32.376 --> 12:34.336
that we're taking the curator.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.630
Curators move galleries all the time.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.340
You should still tell her.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.050
People tend to feel betrayed

12:40.134 --> 12:44.513
when they find out
about something too late.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.394
Okay. Thank you for helping.

12:51.729 --> 12:55.065
I'm not helping you.
I just want to succeed together.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.236
Go to bed first. I'll join you later.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.321
Okay.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.545

13:47.993 --> 13:51.956

13:52.039 --> 13:54.041

13:56.293 --> 13:58.671
-Hello.
-Thank you.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.798
-Your name?
-Ji Won-u.

14:02.258 --> 14:05.177

-Thank you.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.804
Next, please.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.057
Your name?

14:10.140 --> 14:11.642
Seo Woo-jae.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.989
Let me take a photo for you.

Stand over there, please.

JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

14:35.833 --> 14:39.295
Ready? One, two…

14:40.087 --> 14:41.714
HAE-WON

14:41.797 --> 14:45.134
You're getting a call
from someone named Hae-won.

14:45.217 --> 14:48.053
You can reject it.
I can call her back later.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.848
One, two, three.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.272
We all have a window in our hearts.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.525
You can either stay indoors
or open it and step outside.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.819
That's up to you.

15:06.655 --> 15:10.200
Do you have any questions or want to…

15:13.120 --> 15:15.080
Come forward, sir.

15:20.210 --> 15:24.131
He's Mr. Seo Woo-jae.
He had his exhibition here last month.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.762
I'm curious about something.

15:33.057 --> 15:33.974
That painting.

15:34.725 --> 15:38.479
May I know where that is?

15:44.193 --> 15:47.821
It's just a grassland.
Why are you curious about where it is?

15:55.245 --> 15:57.498
The breeze feels nice.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.214
I was wondering…

16:07.466 --> 16:09.551
if I knew that place.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.397
Probably not. It's from my imagination.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.110
We'll take the next question.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.655
Yes, the person in the back. Ask away.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.460
JEONG HUI-JU'S SOLO INVITATIONAL EXHIBIT

16:56.056 --> 16:57.016
Where is she?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.103
Where is Gu Hae-won?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.564
I came here alone.

17:06.692 --> 17:07.818
I'm sorry.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.155
I must've made you feel uncomfortable.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.745
Are you okay?

17:18.996 --> 17:22.291
Excuse me. Can we take a photo with you?

17:24.084 --> 17:25.002
Sure.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.175
Good work today, Ms. Jeong.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.343
How about we go eat something?

17:33.427 --> 17:37.014
I'm sorry, but let me step out
for a minute.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.280
Does Hui-ju know about this?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.534
Is this why you called me over?

18:00.579 --> 18:03.540
How do you always pick
the shallowest women?

18:03.624 --> 18:06.293
-Mom.
-She's that problem teacher, isn't she?

18:07.044 --> 18:09.046
I told you to get rid of her,
not hit on her.

18:12.049 --> 18:16.220
CHIEF DIRECTOR PARK YEONG-SEON

18:17.387 --> 18:19.431
Your father bought those tickets

18:19.515 --> 18:22.101
when he was barely able to walk.

18:22.684 --> 18:23.894
TICKET
SEOUL TO ULSAN

18:23.977 --> 18:25.938
Even in his 70s,

18:26.939 --> 18:29.441
he couldn't forget her
and wanted to go see her.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.362
Apparently, he kneeled and begged
his caregiver

18:33.445 --> 18:34.738
to take him to her.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.407
How disgusting.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.702
Don't pretend you didn't know that.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.331
I lived 40 years
with that empty shell of a man.

18:45.666 --> 18:49.503
I won't condone cheating
even if it's my son.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.881
That will never happen,
so don't worry about me.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.425
Be wary of that useless person
who showed you this.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.803
How's the gallery going?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.098
It's going well.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.311
Keep me posted on every detail
whether good or bad.

19:06.395 --> 19:08.438
Hui-ju is an artist. She'll do--

19:08.522 --> 19:10.315
Yet she knows nothing about business.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.360
Painting and doing business
are clearly different.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.487
Get your money's worth!

19:15.571 --> 19:17.531
-Don't say that--
-Am I wrong?

19:18.907 --> 19:21.618
She visited the UK to see Li-sa
and stayed for three years.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.580
You stayed here
and supported her all those years!

19:25.205 --> 19:26.748
Did she even see Li-sa?

19:26.832 --> 19:29.042
She went to Ireland to study…

19:30.878 --> 19:31.879
Hold on.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.174
Ho-su was born there, wasn't he?

19:38.927 --> 19:42.681
Is this why you partnered up
with that medical center in Ireland?

20:02.784 --> 20:03.994
What brings you here?

20:05.704 --> 20:08.290
Someone showed my mom
something she didn't need to see.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.625
What was it?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.252
It's not a big deal.

20:13.754 --> 20:17.174
I told her to be careful of that person
who tried to make a big deal of it.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.303
Can you give us some privacy?
I have family matters to discuss.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.035
What's this about?

20:47.537 --> 20:50.499
I heard you're in charge of Seo Woo-jae.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.292
Not anymore.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.836
Dr. Choi from Psychiatry is in charge now.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.506
Psychiatry? He's not injured?

20:58.548 --> 21:01.635
It seems you already know
about his condition.

21:04.137 --> 21:06.682
He wants to get his memories back.

21:07.808 --> 21:08.642
Is it true?

21:10.310 --> 21:11.144
What do you mean?

21:11.228 --> 21:13.480
He claims he has lost his memories,

21:14.064 --> 21:15.941
but he could be lying for all you know.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.110
Sure. That's possible.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.153
But what for?

21:20.237 --> 21:23.448
Deceiving others is a painstaking hassle.

21:26.868 --> 21:28.078
If he seems

21:29.121 --> 21:30.163
to be improving…

21:31.581 --> 21:32.916
How interesting.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.546
Both you and your wife want
to know what condition he is in.

21:41.925 --> 21:45.095
You're making me curious about him too.

I wanted to get some fresh air,
so I'm on my way to see Dong-mi.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.859
I'm near the gallery.

21:58.942 --> 22:01.528
I was going to ask
if you wanted to have some tea with me.

22:01.611 --> 22:02.988
I'm sorry.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.241

That's okay. Maybe next time.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.417
Bye.

Hello.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.108

That's right. I'm her husband.

22:48.366 --> 22:49.701
It's nice seeing you again.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.245
Are you ill?

22:52.329 --> 22:54.122
No, it's work-related.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.628
I see.

23:00.962 --> 23:04.257
By any chance,
did we ever meet in the past?

23:05.675 --> 23:06.718
No.

23:08.637 --> 23:09.554
Why do you ask?

23:11.098 --> 23:13.517
It's nothing. Goodbye, then.

23:21.566 --> 23:24.319
<i>He wants to get his memories back.</i>

23:50.554 --> 23:54.474
I don't think you come here to fish,
but here you are once again.

23:56.434 --> 23:59.187
It's a great place to sort myself out,

24:00.480 --> 24:01.731
and I like you too.

24:02.858 --> 24:06.778
You don't make me feel uncomfortable
by pitying me for coming here alone.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.115
Watch out. You might fall.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.452
I'd like to swim in a place like this.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.331
You know, in foreign movies,

24:18.415 --> 24:21.751
they jump into the lake bare naked.

24:21.835 --> 24:26.173
They swim with only their heads
above water.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.134
I want to try that.

24:29.217 --> 24:30.886
Not here. It's too dangerous.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.931
The water is deep,
and you don't know what's in there.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.601
One time late at night…

24:40.145 --> 24:41.855
Why is she here out of the blue?

24:44.024 --> 24:45.984
She has a lot on her mind.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.076
I told you this is the perfect spot.

24:59.915 --> 25:00.749
Hui-ju.

25:19.517 --> 25:22.145
What's your deal?
Do you follow me around all day?

25:25.607 --> 25:26.858
Are you a good swimmer?

25:28.818 --> 25:29.694
What?

25:30.362 --> 25:32.447
I once fell into the water.

25:33.448 --> 25:35.450
I thought I was going to drown.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.286
But do you know what scared me more?

25:39.663 --> 25:42.624
The thought of dying
in this pitiful state.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.043
It was horrifying.

25:46.086 --> 25:48.922
So I frantically swam out.
I was embarrassed.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.507
Cut that nonsense.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.510
-Why are you here?
-Your book.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.346
<i>The Story of the Island and the Lake.</i>

25:57.472 --> 25:58.723
On the author's note,

25:58.807 --> 26:02.352
you said you came here when you were
reminded of the tough days in Ireland.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.272
So I wanted to check this place out.

26:08.566 --> 26:09.818
I thought

26:10.443 --> 26:13.822
you had only been in the UK,
visiting Li-sa.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.783
I don't care what you know.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.619
Woo-jae was also in Ireland.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.039
So I thought

26:23.999 --> 26:26.209
maybe you and he--

26:26.293 --> 26:29.296
You're wrong. Like I told you before,
I never saw him there.

26:29.379 --> 26:33.049
I was too busy studying
and childrearing to meet anyone.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.636
Right.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.348
And thanks to that, you finally succeeded.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.767
Just admit that you're unhappy
about my success.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.102
That's not true.

26:44.185 --> 26:47.439
I truly meant it
when I said that I was happy for you.

26:48.356 --> 26:50.483
Had you been a no-name,

26:50.567 --> 26:54.446
all I went through would've
been for nothing. I truly meant it.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.823
Then continue being happy for me

26:56.906 --> 26:58.616
and stop following me around.

27:01.995 --> 27:04.164
Had I gone abroad to study as well…

27:06.541 --> 27:08.835
and had Woo-jae not disappeared,

27:09.711 --> 27:11.212
would things have been different?

27:14.341 --> 27:16.259
You said you'd become happy.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.470
I told you not to get married,

27:18.553 --> 27:21.514
but you told me
that you were going to become happy.

27:22.140 --> 27:26.061
If you're miserable now,
you only have yourself to blame.

27:26.561 --> 27:29.230
You were foolish enough
to solely rely on him

27:29.314 --> 27:30.607
for your happiness.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.526
No one stole anything from you.

27:33.610 --> 27:34.861
I pity you.

27:37.989 --> 27:42.077
You used to shine so blindly
that being poor didn't matter at all.

27:44.454 --> 27:46.373
But you're still obsessing over him.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.125
I truly pity you.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.623
Darn it.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.507
You never had any respect for me.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.302
You haven't changed one bit.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.738
You must be freezing. Here.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.497
It suits you.

29:15.628 --> 29:19.215
I can't believe you saw another man.

29:21.384 --> 29:23.386
Sure. It's understandable.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.681
You were abroad and lonely.
You could've had a fling.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.185
It wasn't a fling.

29:31.352 --> 29:32.937
And I shouldn't have cheated

29:33.021 --> 29:35.648
out of loneliness
while my husband was supporting me.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.735
What is this? You're not giving me
a chance to criticize you?

29:38.818 --> 29:40.069
I regret it.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.738
It won't happen again.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.407
Right. At least you didn't get caught.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.243
She's one fearless girl.

29:47.327 --> 29:48.995
She came here intentionally?

29:49.078 --> 29:50.622
Because of a guy she lost?

29:52.540 --> 29:54.876
-She doesn't know about that.
-She doesn't?

29:55.668 --> 29:57.796
No. I don't think she does.

29:58.588 --> 29:59.923
There's no evidence.

30:00.006 --> 30:02.634
Only he and I knew about this,
and I won't tell anyone.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.553
And I doubt he'll tell either.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.598
Who knows? Intuition is a thing.

30:08.681 --> 30:09.933
Or why would she come here?

30:19.234 --> 30:20.944
Do you not regret getting divorced?

30:22.403 --> 30:23.488
Why would I?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.534
Yes, I failed in marriage,

30:27.617 --> 30:31.538
but if I hadn't divorced him,
my whole life would've failed.

30:32.038 --> 30:33.498
I'm proud of myself.

30:34.749 --> 30:38.086
I won't ever get a divorce.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.089
Don't be so sure.
You don't know what the future holds.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.340
I am sure.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.218
I've already experienced it.

30:45.885 --> 30:49.722
I now know very well how wrong I was.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.666
Why did you film us?

31:16.749 --> 31:18.960
It's not appropriate
to ask a student to do that.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.628
I regret it.

31:21.421 --> 31:23.298
I was just trying to dodge a bullet.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.050
I didn't think
it'd be used for something petty.

31:27.385 --> 31:28.511
Change his hospital.

31:30.430 --> 31:31.973
I hope I'll never

31:32.974 --> 31:34.893
have to see him again.

31:34.976 --> 31:36.603
But weren't you eager to find him?

31:36.686 --> 31:38.187
Now I know where he is.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.982
Be careful of Ju-yeong's father.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.693
Don't expect to be able to control him.

31:43.776 --> 31:45.194
He won't get his way.

31:45.278 --> 31:48.907
Then he will blame you, feeling desperate.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.367
-Is this a piece of advice?
-No, a warning.

31:56.164 --> 31:57.624
I envy your wife.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.212
She has a husband
who'd do anything for her

32:04.213 --> 32:08.176
even if it means
kicking people out of their homes.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.847
Is marriage really that great?

32:13.640 --> 32:16.434
Does it make you comrades
if you have kids together,

32:17.477 --> 32:19.395
even without love?

32:19.479 --> 32:20.980
I do love her.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.567
Our kids are one of the reasons.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.446
But I do

32:29.781 --> 32:30.990
love Hui-ju.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.453
That's why I'm afraid of getting hurt.

32:38.831 --> 32:40.208
Why would you be afraid?

32:41.250 --> 32:44.921
Doesn't being in love mean trust

32:46.089 --> 32:48.049
is a given?

32:52.220 --> 32:55.181
What about you?
Do you trust your husband completely?

32:58.810 --> 33:01.896
There are some you can trust
even if you don't love them.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.942
Then there are those you love
who make you insecure and anxious.

33:08.861 --> 33:11.114
You won't be coming back to our school.

33:12.573 --> 33:14.242
My wife doesn't like it.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.998
I hope this helps.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.643
RECOMMENDATION LETTER

34:05.710 --> 34:08.755
How about we demolish everything
and start with a clean slate?

34:09.505 --> 34:11.215
Let's only demolish that area

34:11.299 --> 34:13.760
and renovate these buildings.

34:13.843 --> 34:17.388
That costs more
than constructing new buildings.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.557
It's a messy neighborhood.

34:19.640 --> 34:23.311
You see, the current leading art galleries

34:24.395 --> 34:28.858
started in empty warehouses
and red-light districts.

34:28.941 --> 34:30.359
Even the National Museum

34:30.443 --> 34:33.029
started from an abandoned tobacco factory.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.533
This will be an interesting place.

34:40.828 --> 34:44.248
Taerim Gallery…
You sure know exactly what you want.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.502
I should if I want to realize it.

34:49.378 --> 34:53.382
Taerim Academy may own
a big share of the cultural foundation,

34:53.466 --> 34:55.218
but Mother is still quite influential.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.678
She'll meddle every chance she gets.

34:57.762 --> 35:01.099
That's okay. She has every right to.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.975
You seem very confident.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.394
Do you think you can handle her?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.146
I do.

35:07.730 --> 35:11.692
Because I know very well
how I've gotten this far.

35:17.865 --> 35:18.741
Right.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.702
About Ms. Gu Hae-won…

35:22.912 --> 35:23.871
Sorry?

35:24.747 --> 35:28.334
Her husband, Seo Woo-jae, is so strange.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.798
My wife is his doctor. Did you know that?

35:36.843 --> 35:37.844
Yes.

35:39.679 --> 35:43.724
I looked into it
just in case she'd run into Li-sa.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.104
I see.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.441
BILLIARD HALL

35:57.655 --> 35:58.948
Who was that?

36:08.374 --> 36:09.667
Hello, ma'am.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.836
<i>Ma'am, this is the kindergarten.</i>

36:11.919 --> 36:13.588
<i>Ho-su keeps vomiting.</i>

36:18.676 --> 36:21.596
Look at how well he's eating.

36:21.679 --> 36:24.974
He doesn't vomit
if you feed him what he wants.

36:28.769 --> 36:32.481
You and Hyeon-seong can spend
the upcoming holiday alone.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.858
Leave Ho-su with me.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.778
Ho-su, where should we go?

36:37.862 --> 36:39.488
Should we take a plane this time?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.448
Yes.

36:40.948 --> 36:42.533
It will be too tiring for you.

36:43.451 --> 36:46.829
And he's still too young.
He won't remember going on--

36:46.913 --> 36:48.247
Of course, he will.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.209
Childhood experiences
will impact him in one way or another.

36:52.251 --> 36:54.503
You never traveled as a kid,
so you wouldn't know.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.134
Ho-su.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.679
Should we visit Ireland
where you were born?

37:03.763 --> 37:04.847
But Mother…

37:07.725 --> 37:11.187
Well… There will be a stopover.

37:12.355 --> 37:15.233
I'm afraid the trip will be
too exhausting for Ho-su.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.151
Why are you so cold-hearted?

37:17.777 --> 37:21.113
While your husband donated
and partnered up with their hospital

37:21.197 --> 37:22.615
because Ho-su was born there.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.493
What do you mean?

37:27.036 --> 37:30.164
I can't believe there's something
Hyeon-seong didn't tell you about.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.667
It seems it's been quite a while.

37:32.750 --> 37:37.296
Slago? Glaig? What was the name?

37:37.380 --> 37:39.298
Sligo General Hospital?

37:40.299 --> 37:41.592
That's where he was born.

37:41.676 --> 37:43.135
Why did you ask when you knew?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.346
There's nothing I like about you.

37:45.429 --> 37:48.140
Hey, just leave
if you're going to ridicule me.

38:27.346 --> 38:29.724
Don't tell me you were following me.

38:30.933 --> 38:32.977
That's rich coming from someone

38:33.060 --> 38:38.357
who picked this hospital of all hospitals
and my brother to be your doctor.

38:40.276 --> 38:44.405
Hui-ju, why are you so hostile towards me?

38:44.488 --> 38:47.241
-That's because Li-sa was--
-Stop using her as your excuse.

38:48.576 --> 38:52.371
I admit what I did to her is wrong,
so I apologized and will repent

38:52.455 --> 38:53.831
for what I did.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.001
Do you think

38:57.710 --> 39:00.338
this is the attitude of someone
who's sorry?

39:03.215 --> 39:04.759
Attitude?

39:06.427 --> 39:08.471
Okay. I'll try to fix it.

39:33.913 --> 39:35.206
Wait.

39:35.289 --> 39:39.210
Mr. Seo, remember
this is a remedial exercise.

39:39.293 --> 39:42.213
You should start slowly
without feeling pain.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.465
Overworking yourself
won't do you any good.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.093
But I think I'm almost there.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.388
Rushing yourself won't speed up
the recovery. So take your time--

39:50.471 --> 39:53.140
Too much time has already been wasted.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.896
I mean for Hae-won, not me.

39:59.897 --> 40:03.025
I'm sure she'll wait for you,
so you don't need to rush it.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.944
I already feel so bad.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.322
I sometimes wonder if my guilt

40:09.532 --> 40:11.909
is forcing me
to pretend to be an amnesiac.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.538
But it's not your fault
that you fell victim to an accident.

40:17.289 --> 40:19.875
To be frank, I'm not sure.

40:19.959 --> 40:22.878
After you blacked out after drinking,
don't you feel like

40:22.962 --> 40:25.005
you must've done something horrible?

40:25.589 --> 40:27.091
It's like that, isn't it?

40:27.174 --> 40:29.677
But most of the time, it's not a big deal.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.805
I hope that's the case,

40:33.639 --> 40:35.266
but I can't trust myself.

40:36.350 --> 40:39.061
I feel like I did something awful to her.

40:39.145 --> 40:42.690
Come on. Had that been the case,
she wouldn't be by your side now.

40:43.482 --> 40:45.985
To remember anything about someone else,

40:46.068 --> 40:49.655
you need to have
a lot of affection and concern for them.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.732
Ho-su must've been exhausted.
He fell asleep right away.

41:25.524 --> 41:26.984
He vomited at home as well.

41:27.067 --> 41:29.862
I'll take him to the hospital
if it doesn't get better.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.327
My mom must've fed him something.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.832
She's planning to go to Ireland
with Ho-su this holiday.

41:43.125 --> 41:46.462
She must want to visit
your first overseas business spot.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.215
I'll talk to her.

41:51.509 --> 41:55.012
Why didn't you tell me about it?
After all, it's Ireland.

41:55.095 --> 41:58.098
You're the one who avoided
talking about Ireland back then.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.726
You said it was unbearable.

42:00.809 --> 42:05.022
You were too busy studying to visit us.
You were very strict with yourself.

42:07.316 --> 42:10.194
Remember when we visited you
during Li-sa's break?

42:10.986 --> 42:12.947
You were still so busy,

42:13.030 --> 42:15.032
and your mind was elsewhere.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.496
Amid all that,
you got pregnant with Ho-su.

42:22.915 --> 42:25.918
You gave birth
and raised him there all by yourself.

42:26.585 --> 42:29.713
I truly admire you for doing that.
And I feel sorry too.

42:30.589 --> 42:32.925
Of all times to get pregnant…

42:35.135 --> 42:38.138
But then again,
the thought of not having him makes

42:38.222 --> 42:39.557
my heart skip a beat.

42:42.351 --> 42:43.435
That's enough.

42:47.856 --> 42:50.693
See? It's not that I kept it from you.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.612
I'm going up first.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.944
<i>This is an accident-related injury.</i>

43:34.653 --> 43:37.573
<i>Did you injure your shoulder here
before the accident?</i>

43:48.667 --> 43:49.668
What are you doing?

43:50.669 --> 43:53.672
Stainless steel is too heavy,
so I'm using bamboo instead.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.343
What are these?

43:57.426 --> 44:00.387
They were my father's.
I found them while cleaning.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.435
Why have you never told me about him?

44:07.019 --> 44:10.272
There's not much to tell you.
He wasn't a good father.

44:18.614 --> 44:19.865
I still want to hear it.

44:20.991 --> 44:23.410
Tell me all the bad memories
you had with him.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.705
I'd rather hear from you
than someone else.

44:31.418 --> 44:32.294
Hae-won.

45:01.156 --> 45:02.074
Hello?

45:03.951 --> 45:04.910
Yes.

45:06.537 --> 45:08.205
I see.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.126
Thank you.

45:20.759 --> 45:24.263
Someone bought your work.

45:37.025 --> 45:38.527
We're not open…

45:41.363 --> 45:43.323
You're working on the weekend too.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.662
You want to go
to Taerim High School of Arts, right?

45:49.621 --> 45:52.833
But do you think
you're good enough to make it?

45:53.667 --> 45:54.501
Sorry?

45:55.294 --> 45:59.047
Why did you give me your phone?

46:03.594 --> 46:05.012
Let me rephrase that.

46:05.512 --> 46:07.639
Did Ms. Gu tell you to?

46:10.392 --> 46:13.020
Do you do whatever she tells you?

46:15.606 --> 46:18.650
Why don't you take out your phone?
You love filming things.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.904
Record what I'm about to say.

46:23.906 --> 46:26.283
You can also show it to her.

46:33.665 --> 46:37.586
ACCOUNT OWNER: SEO WOO-JAE
TOTAL DEPOSIT: 12 MILLION WON

46:42.090 --> 46:45.177
Thank you for selling my work for me
even though I'm just a rookie.

46:46.303 --> 46:48.138
But you don't need to try so hard.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.432
I didn't have to try hard.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.601
The buyer had a sharp eye.

46:53.268 --> 46:57.147
I'd like to sell my work
only to those who will keep it.

46:58.065 --> 47:00.234
Okay. You have my word.

47:05.239 --> 47:08.075
Woo-jae, I need to speak with her alone.

47:08.158 --> 47:10.327
Okay. I'll wait downstairs.

47:12.287 --> 47:13.497
Goodbye.

47:20.003 --> 47:22.297
Actually, I wanted to talk to you as well.

47:23.048 --> 47:24.049
Sorry?

47:24.132 --> 47:26.885
I'd like to hire you.

47:28.011 --> 47:29.930
But I have no experience in this field.

47:30.722 --> 47:33.475
-If it's because of him--
-In a way, yes.

47:33.559 --> 47:36.728
But I also appreciate
your attitude towards artwork.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.397
So I'm offering you this job.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.400
Our curator I relied on

47:41.483 --> 47:44.403
will be leaving with Ms. Jeong,
so I'm a bit short-handed.

47:46.446 --> 47:49.032
Right. What did you want to talk about?

47:49.116 --> 47:52.744
Well, it's about the buyer.

47:53.829 --> 47:55.205
They paid a hefty sum.

47:55.289 --> 47:57.124
They're considering it an investment.

47:57.624 --> 48:00.836
They offered a higher price
than we had expected.

48:00.919 --> 48:02.462
I'm grateful,

48:02.963 --> 48:05.257
but why won't you tell us their name?

48:07.801 --> 48:12.222
They specifically asked me
to keep it a secret.

48:13.181 --> 48:17.227
Please don't ask. Trust is crucial
in this line of work, so I can't tell you.

48:43.962 --> 48:45.672
Is your exhibition already over?

48:46.923 --> 48:49.593
Yes, it was a special exhibition,
so it was short.

48:51.053 --> 48:52.512
Then why are you here?

48:54.181 --> 48:56.975
What about you?
To see your mom's exhibition?

48:59.478 --> 49:00.729
What about you?

49:02.189 --> 49:03.565
Are you here to see my mom?

49:06.943 --> 49:10.030
No. Her artwork.

49:16.328 --> 49:17.871
All the subjects…

49:21.541 --> 49:23.043
are a doted daughter.

49:23.543 --> 49:25.921
Of course. After all, she's a mom.

49:27.589 --> 49:29.174
That's not a given.

49:29.883 --> 49:32.761
Not all parents love their children.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.210
Hey. Do you know what this is?

50:09.506 --> 50:11.383
-Heath?
-<i>Heath.</i>

50:11.967 --> 50:13.510
<i>These wildflowers</i>

50:13.593 --> 50:16.471
<i>bloom once a year in the wilderness.</i>

50:19.307 --> 50:22.561
It's a heath flower.
They bloom in the wilderness.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.172
Should I do it instead?

50:51.298 --> 50:54.176
I may be a terrible cook,
but I'm still better than you.

50:54.259 --> 50:56.178
You can't cook.

50:57.262 --> 50:58.805
Of course, I can.

50:58.889 --> 51:02.517
When you were busy with school,
I did all the cooking.

51:15.614 --> 51:16.740
No.

51:18.533 --> 51:20.368
You never did that.

51:36.843 --> 51:37.969
Hello, Mother.

51:38.053 --> 51:40.639
<i>Did you buy something again?</i>

51:40.722 --> 51:41.848
Sorry?

51:41.932 --> 51:44.142
Or are you telling me to buy it?

51:45.477 --> 51:46.853
"Seo Woo-jae"?

51:49.940 --> 51:52.359
I called you
because they sent it to my office!

51:53.068 --> 51:56.154
What is this useless thing?
How much was this?

51:56.238 --> 52:00.158
They must've gotten the wrong address.
I'll call them and get back to you.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.746
No, Mother. You can leave it there.

52:04.830 --> 52:06.540
I'll send someone over.

52:07.499 --> 52:08.625
Okay.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.639
This is Jeong Hui-ju.

52:22.722 --> 52:25.100
The art piece from Hwain Gallery…

52:27.185 --> 52:30.021
Sorry? They changed the address?

52:30.105 --> 52:31.147
One minute.

52:32.148 --> 52:33.358
GU HAE-WON

52:33.441 --> 52:34.734
<i>Did you get it?</i>

52:35.402 --> 52:38.864
<i>Thank you so much for purchasing it.</i>

53:14.357 --> 53:15.317
You really came.

53:15.817 --> 53:17.444
Sit down.

53:19.237 --> 53:20.447
She'll have the same.

53:22.407 --> 53:24.910
It's okay. I'm not a regular here anyway.

53:26.578 --> 53:28.663
-I'll prepare some tea.
-Thank you.

53:32.334 --> 53:35.587
I was going to pay for it,
as a thank-you drink.

53:36.796 --> 53:38.423
What are you…

53:40.091 --> 53:42.344
I have a knack for finding things.

53:43.094 --> 53:47.557
For example, Woo-jae or his first buyer.

53:48.725 --> 53:51.978
Why did you send it to Taerim Hospital?
What were you trying to do?

53:52.062 --> 53:54.481
Goodness. Did I send it
to the wrong address?

53:55.398 --> 53:57.943
I must've gotten your storage address

53:58.026 --> 54:01.821
and the address of your mother-in-law,
a famous collector, mixed up.

54:02.822 --> 54:05.617
But it's no problem, right? You're family.

54:08.495 --> 54:09.788
Why did you purchase it…

54:11.373 --> 54:14.417
if you were this anxious
about others finding out about it?

54:17.420 --> 54:20.006
Do I need your permission
to be supportive of him?

54:22.008 --> 54:23.760
Supportive of him?

54:24.761 --> 54:26.513
Are you justifying yourself?

54:28.974 --> 54:30.850
It's just so convenient

54:32.018 --> 54:34.729
that money is a means of being supportive.

54:36.648 --> 54:38.024
Why are you so twisted?

54:39.484 --> 54:40.652
You're right.

54:42.904 --> 54:44.823
Why have I turned out this way?

54:44.906 --> 54:47.200
I'm so sick and tired of your sob story.

54:48.785 --> 54:50.787
Don't you ever approach my family again.

54:50.870 --> 54:53.331
And don't meet my husband alone.
I can't stand it.

54:57.419 --> 55:00.755
Right. I'd feel that way too.

55:05.677 --> 55:07.137
But why did you?

55:09.222 --> 55:10.056
What?

55:12.142 --> 55:14.519
Because he was the only thing you lacked?

55:16.646 --> 55:19.482
But he meant everything to me.

55:28.366 --> 55:31.244
Are you drunk?
What nonsense are you spewing?

55:33.496 --> 55:35.874
I wish this was all just nonsense.

55:40.837 --> 55:42.756
Why didn't you just come clean?

55:44.883 --> 55:47.093
You two were
the most precious people to me,

55:47.761 --> 55:49.804
so I would've ultimately let you have him.

55:55.685 --> 55:59.105
What is this bullshit
you're talking about?

56:01.107 --> 56:03.318
How long will you stay delusional?

56:04.819 --> 56:06.780
Are you trying to get revenge?

56:12.660 --> 56:13.870
Not at all.

56:14.788 --> 56:17.373
Doing so won't turn back time.

56:19.501 --> 56:21.377
I'm giving you a warning.

56:22.712 --> 56:24.714
I won't sit still this time.

56:27.967 --> 56:29.719
You're completely insane.

56:30.887 --> 56:31.805
Snap out of it.

56:34.474 --> 56:36.059
I have a question.

56:36.142 --> 56:38.686
Did he ever cook for you?

56:44.067 --> 56:46.653
What was his best dish?

56:48.780 --> 56:50.281
You crazy bitch.

56:53.618 --> 56:55.328
I wonder if Ho-su remembers

56:56.079 --> 56:57.831
what his favorite dish was.

57:14.347 --> 57:15.640
Gosh.

57:23.982 --> 57:27.485
It's true that people become predictable
when they're cornered.

57:28.403 --> 57:29.571
How boring.

58:38.264 --> 58:42.227
Sir, there's some crazy woman
slamming her bag outside…

58:45.813 --> 58:47.357
And here's another one.

58:47.440 --> 58:50.026
You happily packed up and left for a guy.

58:50.109 --> 58:52.195
What are you doing here in broad daylight?

58:58.618 --> 59:02.288
What happened? Did you drink it
or splash it onto your face?

59:02.789 --> 59:04.582
What is it? Tell me.

59:05.083 --> 59:06.584
Is it that bastard again?

59:07.335 --> 59:11.089
God, you're such an idiot.
Why did you give him another chance?

59:11.172 --> 59:12.632
I told you people never change.

59:13.967 --> 59:17.762
Fine. If you don't want to talk,
then don't. Whatever.

59:18.638 --> 59:20.139
I want what she's having.

59:20.723 --> 59:21.975
People can change.

59:26.854 --> 59:31.526
Depending on the barrel you use, the same
wine can end up with different tastes.

59:33.111 --> 59:36.239
People can change when they're put
in a different environment.

59:36.322 --> 59:38.950
Please. You can't compare people to wine.

59:39.033 --> 59:40.535
Don't be ridiculous.

59:41.119 --> 59:43.663
Right? Wine is better.

59:44.330 --> 59:47.375
At least the taste of wine
doesn't betray you.

59:48.960 --> 59:49.961
That's true.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.383
-Where are you going?
-Home.

59:56.134 --> 59:59.554
Don't argue over me.
You'll grow on each other.

1:00:02.223 --> 1:00:03.558
We weren't arguing.

1:00:03.641 --> 1:00:05.893
What do you take me for?

1:00:05.977 --> 1:00:07.228
He just kept--

1:00:07.312 --> 1:00:10.273
See? You keep talking.

1:00:14.736 --> 1:00:17.989
What the hell are you talking about? Jeez.

1:00:18.615 --> 1:00:20.241
Damn it.

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:25.288
Did you go out?

1:00:25.371 --> 1:00:27.874
She takes after me in the worst aspects.

1:00:27.957 --> 1:00:29.709
She's a terrible judge of character.

1:00:30.418 --> 1:00:32.503
Most men are lousy.

1:00:33.379 --> 1:00:35.131
You two aren't to blame.

1:00:46.643 --> 1:00:48.227
What's all that?

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:50.563
I didn't know what you liked to cook.

1:01:45.827 --> 1:01:47.453
Ho-su, come sit down.

1:01:47.537 --> 1:01:48.830
Have one before you go.

1:01:50.164 --> 1:01:51.791
I don't want to.

1:01:52.709 --> 1:01:53.960
Open up.

1:01:55.336 --> 1:01:58.005
Good. If you eat this,
you'll become strong

1:01:58.089 --> 1:02:00.341
and even hit home runs.

1:02:00.425 --> 1:02:01.884
How is it? Isn't it good?

1:02:04.804 --> 1:02:08.266
I wonder if Ho-su remembers
what his favorite dish was.

1:02:11.060 --> 1:02:11.894
Are you okay?

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:14.105
Yes.

1:02:14.605 --> 1:02:16.274
<i>When are you coming to practice?</i>

1:02:17.775 --> 1:02:20.236
<i>Why aren't you replying? Hey.</i>

1:02:20.778 --> 1:02:22.447
Li-sa, are you really not coming?

1:02:22.530 --> 1:02:24.240
You could get some fresh air and--

1:02:24.323 --> 1:02:25.533
I have practice today.

1:02:25.616 --> 1:02:28.703
We haven't had a family outing
in a while. How about postponing--

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:31.164
Mom, the competition is next week.

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:32.832
Don't you know that?

Can't I cheat a little to get what I want?

1:07:48.439 --> 1:07:51.942
If we're going to die anyway,
I wanted to die in a place like that.

1:07:54.653 --> 1:08:00.201
