WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.350
Mike, this is Will, my hot young pupil.

00:02.400 --> 00:03.960
Are you going to be a barrister, then?

00:04.010 --> 00:07.010
Oh, yeah, fingers crossed.
There are four of us

00:07.060 --> 00:09.710
and Chambers are only
going to give us one place.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.190
It's actually kind of scary.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.910
The junior tenants did odds on
which one of us would get tenancy.

00:13.960 --> 00:17.030
So, if Danielle is Angry Chav,
then I'm guessing I'm...

00:17.080 --> 00:18.310
.. DJ Stupid.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.590
This is what you wanted.

00:19.640 --> 00:21.870
You're making a difference,
helping people in need.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.070
Yeah, I'm helping people
in need, mostly, I guess.

00:24.120 --> 00:25.430
Hello!

00:25.480 --> 00:27.310
To be guilty of a crime, normally,

00:27.360 --> 00:29.790
you have to do it, and
also intend to do it.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.870
Your Honour, my pupil is
acquainted with juror number three.

00:32.920 --> 00:34.710
- How so, Mr Packham?
- There was a kiss.

00:34.760 --> 00:37.110
Will, quick question --
how's your girlfriend?

00:37.160 --> 00:41.670
- What are we doing this for?
- Just... ice?

00:41.720 --> 00:45.110
To win! A barrister burns to win.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.670
- QC interviews next week.
- Actually, I didn't apply.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.190
I mean, what's silk?

00:49.240 --> 00:53.560
I don't need my talent confirmed
by some cloak of... worm spunk.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.870
Well, this is secluded.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.990
Feels very cloak-and-dagger.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.750
It was just the only place
I could get a table.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.630
Um, do you think I can
be seen from the window?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.510
It's just we're backlit,

01:09.560 --> 01:12.110
and I have very recognisable hair.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.030
It's nothing to be ashamed of, you know.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.070
Most QC candidates use a
consultant these days.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.030
- Perhaps that's where you went wrong.
- How do you mean, went wrong?

01:21.080 --> 01:22.910
I didn't apply for silk, Fiona.

01:22.960 --> 01:25.270
According to my mate at
QC Appointments, you did.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.390
Maybe your mate is mistaken.

01:27.440 --> 01:29.710
He definitely saw your name on the list.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.800
Maybe he hallucinated.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.990
Maybe he was reading about me,

01:35.040 --> 01:36.670
then shifted his gaze to the list

01:36.720 --> 01:38.680
thus provoking an optical illusion.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.790
Why have you asked me here, Caroline?

01:42.840 --> 01:45.510
Well, as I say, I didn't apply for QC,

01:45.560 --> 01:47.430
but if I did apply,

01:47.480 --> 01:49.910
um, I'd like to know...

01:49.960 --> 01:51.870
.. why would they not want me?

01:51.920 --> 01:54.350
Why would they think I was bad?

01:54.400 --> 01:56.190
Well, I can make a few phone calls,

01:56.240 --> 01:58.190
find out what people are saying about you,

01:58.240 --> 02:01.310
- so you're on top of things
this time round. - Great.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.990
First time round. But, yeah,
I'll drink to that. To new, um...

02:05.040 --> 02:07.630
- A new start. - Yeah, well, not a
new start. There wasn't an old start.

02:07.680 --> 02:09.669
- New something, though.
- Well, I mean, I like "new",

02:09.720 --> 02:12.150
- but I don't want to imply
any previous... - New things?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.350
Yes, great, new things.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.400
New things.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074

02:30.320 --> 02:31.870
- Caroline!
- Morning.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.870
- How's Mummy's bouncing boy?
- Yeah, pretty good.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.030
New bike, and Nessa's
coming back today, so...

02:36.080 --> 02:38.070
- Who's Nessa?
- Er, my girlfriend?

02:38.120 --> 02:39.350
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.870
Excellent evidence summary
you put together last night.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.830
Feels like you're getting
the hang of things.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.030
Really? Thanks, Caroline.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.430
- Your advice...
- All right, don't go on about it.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.270
Oh, and, er, there's a bag I
need you to get from Chambers.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.830
Won't be a hassle, will it?

02:51.880 --> 02:53.990
Er, no.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.470
No, that's not a hassle at all.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.430
Whoa, OK!

02:57.480 --> 02:59.350
Sorry. I know.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.500
- Get off the road!
- Chill out.

03:06.280 --> 03:08.310
OK, Danielle. Picture this.

03:08.360 --> 03:09.710
You've been in court all day.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.910
Murder...

03:10.960 --> 03:12.870
.. or some abuse case.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.950
Your head's filled with depravity,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.430
human suffering even you've
never seen before. Is this...

03:18.480 --> 03:19.600
.. your jam?

03:25.560 --> 03:27.560
Check it. Yeah.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.870
- It's social commentary, too.
- Great tune. Love it.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.750
As you have every track I've played
you this week. We are so simpatico.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.430
- Coffee, Ashley?
- I think I may have had too much.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.310
No, no, it... it's no problem.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.790
Absolutely not.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.150
- That is one explanation, Miss
Jackson. - Hey, Danielle. - All right.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.960
Another would be that
you gave him the poison.

04:04.600 --> 04:06.350
Say, "That's not what happened at all."

04:06.400 --> 04:07.790
Oh.

04:07.840 --> 04:09.190
That's not what happened at all.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.480
Really?

04:12.880 --> 04:15.230
I have no further questions.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.149
What the fuck are you doing?

04:17.200 --> 04:18.390
Doubty face.

04:18.440 --> 04:21.230
Letting the jury know I
find her evidence dubioso.

04:21.279 --> 04:22.790
Looks like a camel stifling climax.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.350
Miles is brilliant at it.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.270
He could make Malala look shifty.

04:26.320 --> 04:29.270
It's a real privilege, getting to
learn from the Head of Chambers.

04:29.320 --> 04:30.990
Because your mam knows him.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.430
Because he finds me indispensable.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.510
I'm his ever-ready right hand.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.150
- Like wanking.
- No, Pia. Not like wanking.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.790
Don't mind me. Just on
my way to Kennington.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.990
Caroline said my evidence
summary was excellent, so...

04:43.040 --> 04:45.510
Oh, well done, Ladies.
What's in Kennington?

04:45.560 --> 04:48.190
Oh, just an ABH. Sorry,
what did you just call me?

04:48.240 --> 04:50.230
Ladies. It's your new name.

04:50.280 --> 04:52.710
It's like Ladies' Man but
I shortened it because,

04:52.760 --> 04:54.350
well, I suppose, I'm an artist.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.910
It's because you boinked that juror.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.630
What? I didn't boink her.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.150
Oh, really? Cos Liam says you boinked her.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.310
He knew the positions and everything.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.830
- Pia, I need a point of law looking at.
- Sure, Angela.

05:04.880 --> 05:08.120
- Mail me the link.
- Are you Will? - Yes.

05:09.280 --> 05:10.480
Hm.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.550
How many people in Chambers
know about the juror thing?

05:14.600 --> 05:16.230
I don't know. Maybe...

05:16.280 --> 05:17.950
.. everyone?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.830
Sorry, Ladies.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.350
Labels stick.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.350
This kid I knew wet
himself in a mascot suit

05:23.400 --> 05:24.910
first night of Freshers' Week.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.710
For the rest of uni, everyone
called him Pissbear Liam...

05:27.760 --> 05:29.720
Ian! Pissbear Ian.

05:31.600 --> 05:32.790
Ian was his name.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.400
Thanks, Miles.

05:38.760 --> 05:42.350
Do you know about this? Everyone in
Chambers thinks I shagged the juror?

05:42.400 --> 05:44.310
- No. Does it matter?
- Yes.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.150
Because it was just a one-off drunk kiss.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.790
Angela just looked at me
like I smell of roast baby.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.440
Will, shut the fuck up and move on.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.830
- What are you doing?
- I'm hiding from Ashley.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.390
I'm waiting to bump into Miles.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.950
He's got this big, new case coming up.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.350
The alt-right online
guy who filmed the kids?

06:00.400 --> 06:02.150
The YouTube Paedo Nazi. He's doing that?

06:02.200 --> 06:05.030
Yeah. I have to shadow him on that case.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.430
Liam and Pia have been
getting all the good work.

06:07.480 --> 06:12.630
- Liam, are you ready?
- No, since Majewski, the test for recklessness

06:12.680 --> 06:15.070
is subjective, not objective.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.790
- You should really
know this, Will! - What?

06:17.840 --> 06:19.080
Will?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.400
Will.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.040
I've heard your name.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.400
You're the one who boinked the juror.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.350
Er, yes, but as I've been
explaining to these guys...

06:35.400 --> 06:37.350
Awesome stuff. Great to meet you.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.470
Oh, thank you very much, thank you.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.470
- I was kind of his wingman.
- Oh, I'm sorry, did somebody speak?

06:42.520 --> 06:44.190
- Er, me.
- No.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.740
Surely nobody would
interrupt our conversation!

06:47.360 --> 06:48.310
Will...

06:48.360 --> 06:52.510
.. what is the number-one
thing a barrister strives for?

06:52.560 --> 06:53.910
Oh. To win.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.670
Pana-a-a-ache.

06:56.720 --> 07:00.190
- Panache?
- You must cultivate a myth.

07:00.240 --> 07:03.390
Not me, of course. I'm... married.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.030
I mean, maybe in my day, perhaps.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.590
Actually, I was a pupil
with Liam's mother.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.550
She'll tell you.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.470
What?

07:14.520 --> 07:15.990
But, no, not these days.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.800
Three kids. Three...

07:19.960 --> 07:21.720
.. beautiful kids.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.160
Panache.

07:28.000 --> 07:28.960
Panache.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.120
Mush!

07:33.520 --> 07:34.840
Thank you.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.630
- She hit me in the tit.
- OK.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.750
Because Deanna says you came
at her right from the start.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.870
Nah, not true. I was there, like,
I mean, I went round to hers,

08:12.920 --> 08:14.990
yeah, but to reason it
out, cos she was squatting

08:15.040 --> 08:17.590
- on the father of my kids.
- So you discovered your boyfriend

08:17.640 --> 08:20.830
- was at Deanna's and went round.
- Yeah, but to be reasonable.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.070
Like, tell them, I'm there
reasonable and she hit me

08:23.120 --> 08:24.830
- in the tit.
- What were Deanna's injuries?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.480
Permanent scarring to the
face. Three cracked ribs.

08:28.720 --> 08:30.950
Yeah, I fucked her up in self-defence.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.390
So it's your word against hers.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.710
Hm.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.190
This could come down
to who the jury like...

08:37.240 --> 08:39.240
.. more.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.030
I got bail, innit? It's my right.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.750
Hetty. Hetty!

08:46.800 --> 08:48.950
- Oh, my fucking God!
- Lee?! What is he doing here?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.230
- Will, can you see him off?
- OK, mate.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.910
- Hetty!
- Be a bit manly.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.190
OK, mate. No, thank you! No, thank you!

08:55.240 --> 08:57.230
I want to talk to Hetty.
I knew she was up today.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.390
- I wondered where the kids were.
- With my sister!

08:59.440 --> 09:02.110
- No business of yours, is it?
- Look, Hetty, can we just talk?

09:02.160 --> 09:05.310
- It's all over with Deanna.
- Oh, piss off, Lee! Piss off!

09:05.360 --> 09:07.190
You heard the lady, thank you very much.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.310
- Thank you. Let's scoot.
- All right.

09:09.360 --> 09:10.520
Afternoon.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.870
I'm not going back to him.

09:12.920 --> 09:16.230
You know, he's always begging
me, but it's a trust thing.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.150
And once that trust's been
broken three or four times,

09:19.200 --> 09:22.750
it's just, you know. So put me
up to witness. I'll tell them.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.750
Er, no. No, no, no, Hetty. We're
not going to put you in the box.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.830
You've got a ton of
previous, and studies show

09:28.880 --> 09:32.950
juries prefer non-aggressive,
sober, clear witnesses.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.590
No way, no. I'm clear! I'm clear!

09:36.640 --> 09:37.750
I always...

09:37.800 --> 09:39.320
No.

09:40.720 --> 09:43.630
- Well, how are you going to do it, then?
- You keep quiet,

09:43.680 --> 09:46.990
I go after Deanna, and we'll let
the jury form their own impressions.

09:47.040 --> 09:49.030
Sound like a plan, yeah?

09:49.080 --> 09:51.550
Oh, and this needs to change.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.470
- Did you bring the bag? - What, my
clothes? - It's in the robing room.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.680
- Great. What size are you? - 12. - 12.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.720
- 16.
- Hm? What?

10:17.120 --> 10:18.870
Hello?

10:18.920 --> 10:22.870
Hello, is that the Don
Juan of Bedford Row?

10:22.920 --> 10:26.190
- Er, who is this?
- It's Miles, Will.

10:26.240 --> 10:28.110
Your learned Head of Chambers.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.790
Just calling to say, try not to make
love to the entire jury pool today.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.910
Yeah, got to keep some
eligible for trial, eh?

10:35.960 --> 10:38.750
It's members of the jury,
not members in the jury.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.550
"Summon the jury", not "come on the jury".

10:42.600 --> 10:44.000
Don't be fucking disgusting!

10:45.320 --> 10:48.200
- Stand over there!
- OK.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.080
Hope you don't mind the bawdinage, Will.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.470
So, I've got this case, big media thing.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.550
A vlogger who maybe
likes to film under-12s.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.550
The YouTube Paedo Nazi.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.990
Are you asking me to do
the YouTube Paedo Nazi?

11:05.040 --> 11:06.990
I thought it might be
fun to work on together.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.470
I say "together" you will do exactly
as you're told. It starts next week.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.910
That is, of course, as long
as Caroline doesn't need you.

11:13.960 --> 11:16.860
Fuck Caroline. Actually, please
don't tell her I said that.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.510
- I'll keep your secrets
if you keep mine. - Yeah.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.120
- Speak soon.
- Thanks, Miles. Thank you. OK, bye.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.590
I'm not wearing this.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.030
Put it on.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.670
- Chelsea Bun?
- Woof. You're getting to know me.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.750
Who were you talking to?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.310
Miles. That was Miles.

11:42.360 --> 11:45.870
- Our honey-voiced Head of Chambers.
- Yeah. - You should hear him in court.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.430
Like listening to an
audiobook called Oily Wanker.

11:48.480 --> 11:52.190
He's actually asked me to shadow
him on the YouTube Paedo Nazi case.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.470
Look at you, spreading your wings!

11:54.520 --> 11:55.840
Thank you. Yeah.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.470
I think he only likes me
because of the juror thing.

11:59.520 --> 12:01.950
Like I think he thinks I'm
sort of a player or something?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.830
Good. A barrister needs a brand.
Didn't want to say it before,

12:04.880 --> 12:07.510
- but you were coming across as a
bit vanilla. - You've definitely

12:07.560 --> 12:10.310
- said that before. - Don't think so.
- You said I was like vanilla cream

12:10.360 --> 12:12.860
mixed with vanilla custard
on a rich vanilla bun.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.870
OK, that does sound like me. Well,
well done. You've punched through.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.710
Thank you. Thank you, yeah. No. It's good.

12:20.760 --> 12:23.240
It's good news. Really... pleased.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.670
It's just, I guess, if I take the case,

12:26.720 --> 12:29.310
it's a bit like I'm confirming
for everyone that I am the guy

12:29.360 --> 12:32.190
- who cheats on his girlfriend.
- You are that guy.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.590
Yeah, but I don't want
it to be the first thing

12:34.640 --> 12:37.200
that people think of
when they think of... me.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.630
Maybe I should just give Miles a
call back. Try to give him a sense

12:41.680 --> 12:43.070
of what I'm actually like.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.710
And lose the case? What's the
point? You're not being honest

12:45.760 --> 12:48.830
- with your girlfriend, are you?
- Er, yeah, when I get home this evening

12:48.880 --> 12:50.350
I'm going to tell her everything.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.190
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

12:52.240 --> 12:54.030
You're, what, 21 years old?

12:54.080 --> 12:57.030
- Er, 29, but thank you.
- This will not do. You've got to start doing

12:57.080 --> 12:59.270
what's best for the situation,
not running around like

12:59.320 --> 13:02.070
- a wide-eyed truth puppy shitting
in his own breakfast. - Yeah, it's not

13:02.120 --> 13:04.830
actually your place to give
me advice when it comes to

13:04.880 --> 13:08.110
my relationships. But thank you
for your... your perspective

13:08.160 --> 13:10.390
is valuable, as always.
Thank you so much, Caroline.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.990
Listen to me. I do not want to be
dragging around some lovelorn loser

13:13.040 --> 13:15.630
for the next eight months. You're
going to take this work from Miles

13:15.680 --> 13:18.480
and you are not going to be
honest with your girlfriend, OK?

13:20.080 --> 13:21.160
Ready.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.590
Oh, yes.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.720
You are perfect.

13:29.640 --> 13:32.030
And, at this point, you
say, my client attacked you?

13:32.080 --> 13:33.110
Yes.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.910
She just came at me out the blue.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.310
- You were surprised?
- Not really.

13:37.360 --> 13:42.360
- She's a very violent person.
- A very violent person, you claim.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.830
Must have been scary for you,

13:46.880 --> 13:49.990
this very frightening woman
confronting you on your doorstep,

13:50.040 --> 13:52.550
when all you'd done was
sleep with her man.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.790
Yeah. It was scary.

13:54.840 --> 13:58.110
Another thing that must have been scary,

13:58.160 --> 13:59.670
you once got into a fight

13:59.720 --> 14:02.920
with a woman outside a bar
in the city centre, yes?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.910
- Yes.
- Yes.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.390
Got a police caution. What happened there?

14:08.440 --> 14:10.510
Fight over a man?

14:10.560 --> 14:14.430
- Was it a fight over a man?
- Yes. It's not the same.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.950
- There are similarities.
- It's not the same.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.910
It is sort of the same.
Problem for you, isn't it,

14:18.960 --> 14:21.670
Miss Lewis? You're a slender
woman. Good for nicking husbands.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.710
Not so good for winning
the fight afterwards.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.490
That bitch put me in hospital!

14:26.640 --> 14:28.960
You hit my client first, didn't you?

14:29.960 --> 14:31.000
No.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.760
No more questions, Your Honour.

14:38.200 --> 14:41.430
- That's a really good doubty face.
- Watch and learn. Watch and learn.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.670
Thank you, Miss Lewis. You may step down.

14:43.720 --> 14:48.430
Members of the jury, now we turn
to the defendant's criminal record.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.590
- God, here goes the Shipping Forecast.
- In January 1998,

14:51.640 --> 14:54.630
she received a warning for
being drunk and disorderly.

14:54.680 --> 14:57.230
In March 1999, she received...

14:57.280 --> 14:59.350
What do you reckon? How
are the jury taking it?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.750
Year Three coffee morning hated Deanna.

15:01.800 --> 15:06.150
Yeah, that's right, home-wrecker's
coming for your husbands next.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.870
General Ukip just wants
to send anyone down.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.390
He's unhappy there's a trial.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.710
You see, this is fun of it, Will.
You play 'em. Image management.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.030
You know, we could have
a chance here. 50/50.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.670
.. finally, in July 2016,

15:17.720 --> 15:21.110
a conviction for threats
with a bladed article,

15:21.160 --> 15:25.480
the threatened person in that
case being a 14-year-old papergirl.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.150
- 60/40.
- 70/30.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.080
Court rise.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.630
♪ Elope with me, Miss Private,
and we'll sail around the world

15:40.680 --> 15:45.150
♪ I will be your Ferdinand
and you my wayward girl

15:45.200 --> 15:49.590
♪ How many nights of talking
in hotel rooms can you take?

15:49.640 --> 15:52.670
♪ How many nights of limping
round on pagan holidays... ♪

15:52.720 --> 15:54.550
So it's been an interesting day.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.900
I phoned up a few movers and shakers
to see what they said about you.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.450
Like I care.

15:59.800 --> 16:02.150
- I can leave this bit out.
- No, go on. Go on.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.510
OK. In court, "she's
unrelenting", "determined".

16:06.560 --> 16:08.550
You cross-examine "like a Komodo dragon".

16:08.600 --> 16:11.550
Those are the lizardy ones that
bite you and then watch as you die.

16:11.600 --> 16:12.830
Wow.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.990
Really? I'm blushing here.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.670
I also asked about you as
a colleague, as a person,

16:18.720 --> 16:20.310
and that was enlightening, too.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.590
Go on.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.550
So, we have "horrible,
horrible, horrible".

16:24.600 --> 16:26.310
As a person, "she's not a person,"

16:26.360 --> 16:28.630
someone said. Bit smart-aleck, I thought.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.790
Other key phrases were
"frowning cuss witch",

16:31.840 --> 16:33.750
"like a sarcastic tractor",

16:33.800 --> 16:36.910
- "horrible, horrible, horrible"...
- You've said that one.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.230
That was two separate people.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.110
And a judge friend was kind
enough to feed in by e-mail,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.120
and she just said, "Able, but twat."

16:45.880 --> 16:47.160
Oh.

16:49.200 --> 16:51.990
- I think a healthy respect...
- To be honest, Caroline,

16:52.040 --> 16:55.150
- it seems you have a real
likeability problem. - So what?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.710
I'm supposed to be less
confrontational? Smile more?

16:57.760 --> 17:00.710
I'm a criminal barrister, not
some reporter from The One Show.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.230
Caroline, the most important
thing is that you be yourself.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.950
- There you go! Great!
- Unless you want to apply for silk again,

17:07.000 --> 17:10.310
in which case you have nine months
to become someone different.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.560
Someone a little sunnier, more optimistic.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.349
- Hey, Liam. - This is deception
and fraud. - What's going on?

17:22.400 --> 17:24.589
- He got the YouTube Paedo Nazi.
- Oh, well done, Will.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.990
It's not a big deal. Miles just
thinks I'm the kind of dude

17:27.040 --> 17:29.590
- it would be fun to work with.
- You're unbelievable.

17:29.640 --> 17:33.110
Making out that you're some
kind of louche legal lothario.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.110
Was it me who did that,
Liam, or was it you?

17:35.160 --> 17:37.150
Oh, no, you're right.
I think that was Liam.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.710
It was not meant to make
people like you! And now what?

17:39.760 --> 17:41.510
Oh! Oh! Oh! This is like Crown and Fagan.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.670
You know, the case where
the little man reversed

17:43.720 --> 17:46.070
onto the police officer's
foot, but it was an accident.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.790
And then it was all about whether
he was assaulting the officer

17:48.840 --> 17:50.990
by not moving the car. So
Miles thinking Will is cool

17:51.040 --> 17:53.550
and sexy isn't Will's fault.
But now it's all about whether

17:53.600 --> 17:55.110
Will's going to put it right or not.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.150
Exactly. Exactly the same.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.230
And Fagan had no duty getting
off the officer's foot.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.470
- Actually, he did. He
was convicted. - Sure.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.270
But it was quite a different case.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.990
There was a car in it, for one
thing, I don't even have a car.

18:07.040 --> 18:10.520
- Are you happy with this?
- Fuck off, Liam. - All right.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.990
Bye, guys.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.480
See ya.

18:20.520 --> 18:23.720
Serves him right for spreading
all those false rumours about me.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.520
Silly Miles.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.270
- Know what that is?
- Smoothie made of bananas and death?

18:42.320 --> 18:44.230
It's Qood.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.840
Food... with a Q.

18:48.160 --> 18:53.030
Meal substitute made of oats, MCT
powder, sunflower oil, bean protein.

18:53.080 --> 18:55.510
All the rage in Silicon Valley.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.360
It's got all the vitamins, and
it's less than a quid a meal.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.910
Tastes like you've sucked off a
scarecrow, but that's by the by.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.830
You actually eat this stuff?

19:05.880 --> 19:07.040
Twice a day.

19:08.600 --> 19:13.480
Because we get 12 grand for this
whole year and I have no backup.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.470
My point is, Will, do not underestimate

19:20.520 --> 19:22.600
what I will do to get this job.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.910
Use this chauvinist crap
to get ahead, but know this.

19:27.960 --> 19:30.150
There will be no mercy.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.110
I will go through you...

19:32.160 --> 19:35.280
.. fast as this stuff goes through
me, and it won't look good.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.000
It does not look good.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.200
OK, pal?

19:42.600 --> 19:43.920
Your choice.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.590
You all right there, Mr Barrister?

20:18.640 --> 20:20.080
Hey, Lee.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.670
Why are you still coming to court?

20:23.720 --> 20:25.560
Just interested, innit.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.990
Hetty and me go back a long time.

20:29.040 --> 20:31.990
And I love her, that's the
truth, despite what I done.

20:32.040 --> 20:35.310
- So what do you reckon? She going down?
- Maybe, yeah.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.110
She won't get too big a sentence, though.

20:37.160 --> 20:39.070
- You guys have kids.
- Oh, right.

20:39.120 --> 20:42.310
- Yeah, that's good. It's good.
- It's good.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.390
Yeah, I'm not with
Deanna any more, you know?

20:45.440 --> 20:49.000
I've made a new start. Got
some work, I do Buddhism.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.350
Not big time. Just online, you know?

20:52.400 --> 20:55.190
Sorry, Lee, is it...? All right,
I'm just trying to kind of...

20:55.240 --> 20:58.040
One of my gurus, he talks about honesty.

20:59.080 --> 21:00.990
He says a lie is a rot.

21:01.040 --> 21:04.710
A man has a duty to tell the truth
even if it does him no good at all.

21:04.760 --> 21:06.400
What do you think about that?

21:07.480 --> 21:08.830
Yeah.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.470
No, I think... there's something in that.

21:11.520 --> 21:16.110
But I guess sometimes truth... can
be very hurtful to other people.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.190
And also...

21:18.240 --> 21:22.240
.. sometimes lies can
be very, er... helpful.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.150
So maybe it is a rot, but
kind of like a good rot?

21:26.200 --> 21:29.430
Like kind of in a... in a...
in a cheese or something?

21:29.480 --> 21:33.710
And, obviously, when you're serving
people cheese, you don't tell them

21:33.760 --> 21:35.750
that it's made of mould.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.520
So you just keep the rot secret...

21:39.600 --> 21:41.720
.. er, for everyone's benefit.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.600
Sorry, are you talking
about with the case?

21:48.680 --> 21:50.510
I said in my statement
I didn't see nothing.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.590
But I was hiding on the
stairs. I saw everything.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.270
Everything?

21:54.320 --> 21:56.870
So did Deanna hit Hetty
first? Did you see that?

21:56.920 --> 21:58.150
Yeah.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.430
But they'll never believe
me now, will they?

22:01.480 --> 22:03.600
The damage is done.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.940
- It's too late now.
- I don't think it is too late, Lee.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.790
- I don't think it is too late. 
- You mean I can still be honest? - Yeah.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.670
I think we can still... Yeah.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.470
We can still be honest.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.670
- You mean I can still be honest.
- Yeah.

22:16.720 --> 22:18.870
That's what... That's
exactly what I'm saying.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.830
Thank you! You're a wise man!

22:24.800 --> 22:27.590
Hi, this is Nessa. Leave a message,

22:27.640 --> 22:29.250
but do wait until after the...

22:30.000 --> 22:31.110
Hey, chicken.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.750
Just calling to make sure
you'll be in tonight,

22:33.800 --> 22:37.950
because I have something that
I want to talk to you about.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.430
- Morning, Simon!
- Yeah, let me know when you finish.

22:40.480 --> 22:44.030
Oh, sorry. Actually, I've got
to go. I'll call you back later.

22:44.580 --> 22:46.680
.. nothing embarrassing, unfortunately.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.430
OK, Palio.

22:49.480 --> 22:51.830
Hear that? Palio. Like the
Sienese horse festival.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.590
Um, Caroline, I'm sure you're
going to say this is wrong...

22:54.640 --> 22:56.990
I'm sure it will be right.
Good to see you. Morning, Will.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.910
- You, too. Are you OK?
- Doodle-dandy!

22:59.960 --> 23:02.350
OK. Um...

23:02.400 --> 23:04.870
Basically, Lee's changing his evidence.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.670
He saw Deanna hit Hetty first.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.590
Ah, bit risky. The prosecution
will ask why he's switching.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.910
Yes, but I was thinking,
it's like you said.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.510
It's about perception. So even
if the jury don't believe him,

23:14.560 --> 23:16.750
they're going to love the
story of a contrite partner,

23:16.800 --> 23:18.440
of a family reunited.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.230
Gosh, you're right.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.990
Will, you are clever.

23:24.040 --> 23:26.110
- You are a little clever clogs.
- You mean we'll do it?

23:26.160 --> 23:28.830
You betcha we will! The truth
will out, and it will be lovely.

23:28.880 --> 23:30.550
Oh! I feel sunny!

23:30.600 --> 23:33.910
Get me a croissant, and make
sure it's angled like a smile.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.760
- OK.
- Hm!

23:41.480 --> 23:42.790
Miles, hello.

23:42.840 --> 23:46.190
What's Packham packing?
That's the question.

23:46.740 --> 23:49.310
Yes. What's Packham packing...!

23:49.360 --> 23:52.070
There's an interlocutory hearing
for the vlogger trial on Tuesday

23:52.120 --> 23:53.910
so I'm going to need you
over the weekend, OK?

23:53.960 --> 23:57.110
Yes, no, absolutely. Thank you.
Miles, listen, I actually just

23:57.160 --> 24:00.070
- wanted to have a chat with you
about something. - Yes, what?

24:00.120 --> 24:01.950
Basically, I didn't sleep with the juror.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.270
It was just a silly drunken kiss.

24:04.320 --> 24:05.990
I'm quite a staid guy.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.670
I don't really engage in laddie banter.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.590
I've basically only slept with sort of...

24:10.640 --> 24:12.110
.. under ten people.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.870
As in, fewer than ten, not people
who are under ten, obviously.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.350
That's a completely
different thing. But, um...

24:17.400 --> 24:20.070
I mean, I've only really ever
done the missionary position.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.470
So, you know, if you're giving
me work cos you think I'm

24:22.520 --> 24:24.420
some kind of young stud, that is not me.

24:25.360 --> 24:28.070
Just in the spirit of, erm, of honesty.

24:28.120 --> 24:31.550
You think I'm giving you work
because you bounced on some juror.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.150
Erm... no.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.870
Obviously, I know it's not
entirely because of that,

24:36.920 --> 24:38.430
but just the impression...

24:38.480 --> 24:40.430
I gave you work because Caroline told me

24:40.480 --> 24:42.720
your evidence summaries were excellent.

24:43.960 --> 24:47.350
Oh, that's actually very nice of her.

24:47.400 --> 24:52.350
Liam, does your fellow pupil
think I'm some kind of moron?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.630
Surely not, Miles.

24:54.680 --> 24:58.390
- No, Miles, I don't think you're a moron.
- Sorry, did someone speak?

24:58.440 --> 25:01.600
Right. I'll see if the
odd blonde girl wants it.

25:04.040 --> 25:05.600
Come on!

25:09.480 --> 25:11.190
It was a massive slap Deanna gave her.

25:11.240 --> 25:12.670
Hetty almost went down.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.510
I remember it as clear as day.

25:14.560 --> 25:17.590
And, Lee, some people might
say you're bound to back Hetty

25:17.640 --> 25:20.670
in this dispute. She's the
mother of your children.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.630
No, I'm telling the truth.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.270
But I'm glad I can.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.640
Because, honest to my heart,
Hetty's a wonderful person...

25:28.920 --> 25:30.840
.. and I've let her down.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.550
And I'm sorry, babe.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.760
I just want to get you
home to show you that.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.070
- General Ukip just smiled.
- Course he did.

25:43.120 --> 25:46.430
Mr Roberts, you're certain
that Miss Lewis struck first?

25:46.480 --> 25:48.350
Oh, yeah, for sure. I was relieved.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.670
Relieved? Why?

25:50.720 --> 25:52.670
Well, Hetty knew I was seeing someone.

25:52.720 --> 25:56.110
And she said if it was Deanna,
she'll mess her up big time.

25:56.160 --> 25:58.070
So, naturally I was worried.

25:58.120 --> 26:00.070
She'd formed the intention. Shit off...

26:00.120 --> 26:03.510
Do you mean to say that
Hetty expressed the intention

26:03.560 --> 26:05.350
of messing Miss Lewis up?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.470
Yeah. But when Deanna hit her. I was like,

26:07.520 --> 26:09.230
"Great, now she's got an excuse."

26:09.280 --> 26:11.870
- Oh, we are so fucked.
- And of course, she particularly didn't like it

26:11.920 --> 26:13.870
- that Deanna was half black.
- Racial aggravation.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.750
That's another five months. I'm
never listening to you again.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.700
- Joint decision.
- Sunny and optimistic. Bunch of bollocks.

I did time once. You just
want to get it started.

26:49.520 --> 26:51.710
You played me.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.920
What? I'm surprised as you are, bruv.

26:56.400 --> 26:57.830
You understand.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.550
I've got two kids with
Hetty, and previous.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.190
It's hard for a dad to get
custody in those circumstances.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.840
So you sent their mother
down for eight months. Nice.

27:07.480 --> 27:09.080
You're not even a Buddhist, are you?

27:11.720 --> 27:13.190
But Hetty's a nasty woman.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.440
You can put a dress on
her, it won't change that.
