00:01.280 --> 00:03.112
Exciting time
in the world right now.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.750
<i>Some believe
there are alternate realities</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:07.433
<i>with other lives
that we're leading.</i>

00:10.560 --> 00:12.336
<i>How many copies
of ourselves exist,</i>

00:12.360 --> 00:14.477
<i>and might our mental states
be conjoined?</i>

00:14.560 --> 00:15.880
<i>Zhang's machine,</i>

00:16.000 --> 00:19.072
<i>he built it under
the Washington Township Power Plant.</i>

00:19.160 --> 00:21.914
<i>Twenty-six employees died
from Leukemia.</i>

00:22.040 --> 00:25.477
I have been trying to ship
my project to the Congo.

00:25.560 --> 00:28.519
I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.956
<i>Sometimes, I dream
of saving the world.</i>

00:31.040 --> 00:34.112
<i>Do you ever think that, if you
imagine something, it would come true?</i>

00:34.240 --> 00:36.436
<i>It happened.
It actually happened.</i>

00:36.520 --> 00:38.239
Are you sure you don't wanna
come with us?

00:38.320 --> 00:40.437
I can't. I'm not done.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.154
Where did the Dark Army go?

00:42.240 --> 00:45.551
Your dream is as good as dead.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.550
FBI. Open the door.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.313
Mr. Zhang, come out!

00:59.360 --> 01:00.360
Mr. Zhang!

01:01.800 --> 01:03.632
Mr. Zhang, we are coming in!

01:06.080 --> 01:09.960
Three, two, one!
Execute, execute, execute!

02:36.480 --> 02:39.154
You were looking
for Minister Zhang?

02:39.600 --> 02:41.319
He isn't here.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.240
He's dead.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.235
There is only Whiterose.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.911
Any advice
for a road trip?

03:18.160 --> 03:19.992
I've never
been on one before.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.160
Neither have I.

03:26.920 --> 03:30.755
Recommend getting a bunch
of Sour Patch Kids.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.870
I've been through a lot,
Darlene.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.556
Thank you for never
giving up on me.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.480
I should get going.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.474
We really pulled this off,
didn't we?

04:28.680 --> 04:30.512
Fuck yeah, we did.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.776
You know, you really
started to grow on me

04:44.800 --> 04:46.792
ever since you stopped
being such a dickhead.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.237
Please tell me
you're not really doing this.

05:05.320 --> 05:07.471
From what I saw
on that drive,

05:07.560 --> 05:11.349
I can make the software on Whiterose's
machine completely unusable.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.320
We will shut it down
for good.

05:14.400 --> 05:18.076
You mean the machine that's in
a goddamn nuclear power plant?

05:18.200 --> 05:20.556
We fuck up, this will
cause a meltdown.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.111
The right malware can corrupt
the machine's entire system.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.759
It won't even
be able to start.

05:25.840 --> 05:28.036
It would take decades
for them to recode it.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.680
No! We're done, remember?

05:30.800 --> 05:32.359
This is what we agreed to.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.999
That's what last night was.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.594
The last step.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.956
We stick with the plan.
We leave.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.911
Besides, it would take you forever
to write that malware, anyway.

05:50.360 --> 05:52.477
You've already written it,
haven't you?

05:54.280 --> 05:55.873
It wasn't that hard.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.038
I used the same rootkit
we used to infect E Corp.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.673
All I need to do is access a terminal
on their network and plug it in.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.439
This is not what
we set out to do!

06:05.520 --> 06:08.399
Whiterose isn't dead
until her machine is!

06:08.480 --> 06:10.756
Since when did her machine
become our goal?

06:10.840 --> 06:12.479
You don't get it, do you?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.710
That's where
all of this started!

06:27.320 --> 06:30.757
You go down this path,
it'll never end.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.952
There will always
be something else.

06:34.280 --> 06:37.512
Another symbol to destroy,
more people to save.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.679
This is an endless war.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.519
At a certain point,

06:44.840 --> 06:46.559
we gotta move on.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.231
Maybe you should go with them.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.519
- Please don't shut me out now.
- I'm not shutting you out.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.671
I wanna do this one
on my own.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
Hey.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.560
You're in the wrong place.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.840
Usually, I handpick someone
to do the introductions,

16:57.920 --> 17:01.072
but I felt that unnecessary
since we've already met.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.239
Please, have a seat.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.592
This isn't
gonna work on me.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.191
What are you referring to?

17:19.440 --> 17:21.829
The computer
I used growing up.

17:23.319 --> 17:25.596
A book my dad
used to read.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.192
You even got QWERTY here
somehow.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.120
It may have
worked on Angela,

17:32.200 --> 17:34.590
but your brainwashing
isn't gonna work on me.

17:36.280 --> 17:40.399
This procedure has never been
about brainwashing.

17:41.200 --> 17:45.638
It is about helping you
come to an understanding.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.760
What's in the box?

17:54.840 --> 17:56.991
I had a lot
of pain growing up.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.877
I wasn't born
who I was meant to be,

18:01.960 --> 18:03.633
and it cost me a lot.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.596
It cost me my one true love.

18:08.280 --> 18:11.830
It cost me the life I was owed,
the world I deserved.

18:14.440 --> 18:15.954
You're not answering
my question.

18:16.040 --> 18:18.430
This world around us,
I'm tired of it.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.597
I'm tired
of the pain it causes.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.951
I'm tired
of the disappointment it is,

18:23.080 --> 18:25.436
and all I've been
trying to do, Elliot,

18:25.520 --> 18:27.159
all I ever wanted

18:27.240 --> 18:30.995
was to finally bring an end
to that dysfunction

18:31.280 --> 18:34.159
and deliver us a better world.

18:45.360 --> 18:48.273
You don't wanna help the world.
You want to destroy it.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.118
You wanna destroy it

18:52.200 --> 18:55.591
because you hate people
for what they've done to you,

18:57.520 --> 19:00.991
and you can't look past that
to actually see the good in it.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.552
Elliot, please.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.470
Don't make me laugh.

19:17.880 --> 19:22.716
You think I'm the one that
wants to destroy the world?

19:23.200 --> 19:25.271
I'm the one that hates people,

19:25.360 --> 19:28.034
that can't see the good in it?

19:28.320 --> 19:30.551
Look around you.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.518
Everywhere we turn,

19:32.600 --> 19:37.152
all we see is spite from our
so-called "fellow man."

19:37.280 --> 19:39.237
Every day we turn on the news,

19:39.320 --> 19:43.837
we're constantly told by our leaders,
our scientists, our religions

19:43.920 --> 19:47.880
that our world is crumbling
and that we are the problem,

19:48.200 --> 19:51.671
we are the root of everything
that is wrong,

19:51.760 --> 19:54.036
that we don't stand a chance.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.720
We are told this so much

19:55.840 --> 20:00.835
that self-hatred is no longer considered
an anomaly but a given,

20:00.920 --> 20:04.197
and yet you dare
point the finger at me

20:04.280 --> 20:07.114
when I try to bring
order to its chaos?

20:07.240 --> 20:12.520
When I have sacrificed
everything to make it better?

20:18.880 --> 20:23.193
Please! Don't make me laugh.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.471
On the contrary,

20:35.960 --> 20:39.670
it is my love for people
that drives me.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.552
It always has been
because I know,

20:43.640 --> 20:46.109
deep in every person's heart,

20:48.760 --> 20:50.672
they are trying to be good.

20:51.560 --> 20:58.034
They were just dealt a bad hand
by a world unfit for us,

20:58.120 --> 21:03.115
so please don't
make me fucking laugh

21:03.520 --> 21:07.639
and accuse me of hating people
when you, Elliot,

21:07.720 --> 21:10.872
wear that hate like
a badge of honor!

21:10.960 --> 21:15.034
Shall I remind you
of your group's name?

21:22.120 --> 21:23.759
Admit it.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.520
Hatred has been your anthem,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.159
not mine.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.039
You're right.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.759
I hate people.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.599
I'm scared of them.

21:49.880 --> 21:53.317
I've been scared of them
practically my whole life.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.633
The people I loved,

21:58.720 --> 22:00.598
people I trusted,

22:00.680 --> 22:03.354
have done
their absolute worst to me.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.718
And for a long time,
that's all I ever knew.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.677
So, yeah, I called
my group fsociety

22:17.840 --> 22:21.470
because you know what?
Fuck society.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.471
Society deserves to
be hated for everything

22:27.560 --> 22:29.791
you said they did and more.

22:32.720 --> 22:37.033
And fuck every last one of them
for what we've all been through.

22:46.360 --> 22:51.230
But then, there are
some people out there...

22:53.040 --> 22:56.511
And it doesn't happen
a lot.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.557
It's rare.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.000
But they refuse
to let you hate them.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.600
In fact, they care about you
in spite of it.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.949
And the really special ones,

23:15.480 --> 23:17.551
they're relentless at it.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.110
Doesn't matter
what you do to them.

23:22.520 --> 23:26.196
They take it
and care about you anyway.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.911
They don't abandon you,

23:30.640 --> 23:33.200
no matter how many
reasons you give them.

23:35.480 --> 23:40.999
No matter how much you're practically
begging them to leave.

23:47.560 --> 23:49.916
And you wanna know why?

23:55.200 --> 23:58.637
Because they feel something
for me that I can't.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.432
They love me.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.400
And for all the pain
I've been through,

24:34.000 --> 24:35.832
that heals me.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.672
Maybe not instantly.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.716
Maybe not even
for a long time,

24:43.440 --> 24:45.079
but it heals.

24:46.960 --> 24:50.112
And, yeah,
there are setbacks.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.279
We do fucked-up things
to each other.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.992
And we hurt each other,
and it gets messy,

24:58.920 --> 25:01.116
but that's just us,

25:02.200 --> 25:04.635
in any world you're in.

25:06.160 --> 25:07.992
And, yeah, you're right.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.713
We're all told
we don't stand a chance,

25:14.400 --> 25:16.869
and yet we stand.

25:18.480 --> 25:22.679
We break,
but we keep going,

25:24.120 --> 25:26.396
and that is not a flaw.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.872
That's what makes us.

25:32.680 --> 25:37.391
So, no, I will not
give up on this world.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.637
And if you can't see why,

25:41.440 --> 25:44.831
then I speak for everyone
when I say,

25:45.480 --> 25:47.153
fuck you!

25:55.960 --> 25:57.679
Pity.

25:58.320 --> 26:00.710
I thought we shared a vision.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.996
What is that?

26:02.120 --> 26:05.431
It appears the plant is losing power
to the cooling system.

26:05.520 --> 26:07.318
- Why?
- As you can imagine,

26:07.400 --> 26:10.074
my machine requires
a significant amount of wattage,

26:10.160 --> 26:12.800
so it has to draw
all the plant's power,

26:12.880 --> 26:14.599
including its
backup generators.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.160
You turned it on?

26:16.280 --> 26:17.919
Of course I have.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.952
We're on
a very tight schedule.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.673
Your machine.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.837
It won't work.
I installed malware.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.832
Yes, we discovered
your breach.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.639
How do you think we found you?

26:28.040 --> 26:29.713
Then you know
it already executed.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.110
Except for the fact that
my machine was already running

26:32.200 --> 26:34.556
by the time you installed
your little exploit.

26:34.640 --> 26:35.994
No, you don't understand.

26:36.080 --> 26:38.834
Earlier you accused me
of being a murderer,

26:39.720 --> 26:41.837
but soon you will see

26:41.920 --> 26:45.118
all those lives that have been lost
so that we could get to this point

26:45.200 --> 26:46.600
will not be in vain.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.273
In fact, they won't be
lost at all.

26:48.360 --> 26:51.671
They will all be found again
as soon as this world around us

26:51.800 --> 26:55.191
transforms
into a parallel world.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.239
A world where we were
meant to be all along.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.880
The machine can't run here,
and you know that.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.440
It's going to
cause a meltdown.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.399
Which is why I have been
trying to move my project.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.719
Our tests here were quite
limited in proximity.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.439
However, you left me
no choice.

27:10.560 --> 27:12.233
Haven't you killed
enough people?

27:12.320 --> 27:16.200
Nobody will be killed.
The opposite, actually.

27:16.440 --> 27:18.477
We will be reborn as new,

27:18.560 --> 27:21.792
finally liberated from
the horrific and brutal past

27:21.880 --> 27:24.031
that we've been
shackled to for so long.

27:24.160 --> 27:25.435
You can't do this.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.479
You said you loved people,

27:27.560 --> 27:28.994
but you're not
giving them a choice.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.280
You're not liberating them.
You're forcing this on them.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.477
I am giving them a choice.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.238
That's why you're here.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.272
I'm gonna show you
what I showed Angela.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.833
What do you mean?

27:45.800 --> 27:48.520
All I ever wanted
from you, Elliot,

27:48.600 --> 27:50.557
was your belief.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.838
What are you
gonna do with that?

27:55.800 --> 27:58.872
I have learned to listen
when time speaks.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.150
Our paths were too precisely
linked to this moment

28:03.240 --> 28:04.913
for there not to be a reason.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.834
This is why.
You get to decide.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.396
Then I'm telling you,
don't do this!

28:37.840 --> 28:39.718
I don't know
what the fuck to do.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.509
We need to figure out
the code to this door.

28:44.560 --> 28:47.439
Try that phone. See if you can
get an outside line.

28:49.240 --> 28:50.879
<i>0-5-0-9.</i>

28:56.680 --> 28:59.036
- Anything?
<i>- 0-5-0-9.</i>

28:59.120 --> 29:00.520
0-5-0-9.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.597
Let's go! There's an access
tunnel down the hall.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.234
If we leave,

29:25.280 --> 29:27.476
the nuclear reactor's
gonna melt down.

29:27.560 --> 29:30.632
Which is why we need to get as far
fucking away from here as possible.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.120
If we don't stop this,

29:32.840 --> 29:34.672
the meltdown will
destroy the whole town.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.634
You wanna stop the meltdown?
How the fuck are we gonna do that?

29:41.000 --> 29:43.037
She said
she gave me a choice.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.635
We don't have
time for this shit.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.954
I don't think
this is just a game.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.957
This place is gonna blow!

30:02.000 --> 30:04.913
This is an override process
to turn off the machine.

30:48.440 --> 30:50.352
We've gotta
get the fuck out of here!

31:20.760 --> 31:23.195
It didn't work.
The alarms are still going.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.794
We've gotta go!

31:25.120 --> 31:28.238
No, I'm missing something.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.717
She wanted us to win.

32:48.840 --> 32:50.399
Did it work?

33:20.440 --> 33:23.797
It's too late, isn't it?

33:55.360 --> 33:56.999
I love you.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.269
I love you, too.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.350
It's an exciting time
in the world.

34:55.480 --> 34:57.631
<i>This is your wakeup call.</i>

34:59.960 --> 35:01.872
<i>This is your wakeup call.</i>

35:04.680 --> 35:06.797
<i>This is your wakeup call.</i>

35:09.280 --> 35:11.192
<i>This is your wakeup...</i>

37:19.440 --> 37:20.669
<i>Did you feel that?</i>

37:20.840 --> 37:22.069
Was that an earthquake?

37:22.200 --> 37:23.759
<i>It can't be, can it?</i>

37:23.840 --> 37:25.320
<i>In New York City?</i>

37:26.520 --> 37:27.920
I don't know.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.320
<i>So weird.</i>

37:29.640 --> 37:31.279
<i>Anyway, are you ready?</i>

37:32.240 --> 37:33.469
For what?

37:33.960 --> 37:35.110
<i>The presentation.</i>

37:35.200 --> 37:37.795
<i>You said that you needed to stay up
all night working on it.</i>

37:41.680 --> 37:44.752
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I don't know
where my head is at.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.713
<i>Are you okay?</i>

37:48.840 --> 37:52.197
I woke up with
a really bad headache.

37:54.680 --> 37:58.037
<i>I see you also haven't made
any progress on packing.</i>

38:03.040 --> 38:04.599
I bought tape.

38:05.360 --> 38:10.754
<i>Okay, well,
that's not nothing.</i>

38:11.800 --> 38:13.359
<i>But it is almost nothing.</i>

38:16.080 --> 38:19.073
My dad just e-mailed me.
I have to head into work.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.000
<i>Don't tell me he's still
checking the traffic for you.</i>

38:22.520 --> 38:24.318
<i>You are such an only child.</i>

38:25.640 --> 38:27.393
You know me.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.917
So I'll talk
to you later, okay?

38:32.400 --> 38:34.073
<i>Elliot,</i>

38:35.000 --> 38:37.560
<i>you're not keeping anything
from me, are you?</i>

38:39.480 --> 38:41.597
What would I be
keeping from you?

38:42.960 --> 38:44.679
<i>I don't know.</i>

38:45.320 --> 38:47.960
<i>You just seem different.</i>

38:52.520 --> 38:55.080
Must be this migraine
I woke up with.

38:55.160 --> 38:56.879
<i>Now it's a migraine?</i>

38:57.600 --> 38:59.273
<i>I'll check in with you later?</i>

38:59.760 --> 39:00.955
<i>Love you.</i>

39:01.040 --> 39:02.838
- I love you.
<i>- Hey.</i>

39:05.080 --> 39:06.992
<i>Can't wait to marry you
tomorrow.</i>

39:26.440 --> 39:28.440
<i>Your call
has been forwarded to...</i>

39:44.400 --> 39:47.154
Mr. Robot, computer repair
with a smile. This is Edward.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.749
Dad, where were you?
You're not answering your cell.

39:50.080 --> 39:52.549
You know I always lose track
of that thingamajig.

39:52.880 --> 39:54.234
What's up, son?

39:54.320 --> 39:56.198
I think Angela knows.

39:57.040 --> 39:58.235
That's impossible.

39:58.320 --> 39:59.913
<i>No, I just talked to her.</i>

40:00.040 --> 40:02.077
She was acting suspicious.

40:02.760 --> 40:04.319
<i>I'm sure you're just
being paranoid.</i>

40:04.400 --> 40:06.073
There's no way she could know.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.760
Dad, I have a feeling.

40:08.920 --> 40:12.072
<i>If she finds out, it will
ruin everything.</i>

40:12.400 --> 40:14.710
Okay. Calm down.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.436
I'm sure you're just nervous
about tomorrow.

40:17.560 --> 40:20.678
Try to act normal. There's no way
she's gonna find out, okay?

40:22.600 --> 40:24.671
<i>- You're right. Okay.</i>
- Just finishing up a call.

40:24.760 --> 40:26.080
Be out in a jiff.

40:27.240 --> 40:29.675
I got a customer.
We still on for lunch?

40:29.920 --> 40:31.912
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Okay.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.310
- See you soon.
<i>- Hey, Dad?</i>

40:34.520 --> 40:36.034
Yeah?

40:36.600 --> 40:38.239
Thanks.

40:38.800 --> 40:40.473
No problem.

40:40.720 --> 40:42.473
I'm always here for you.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.631
Sorry for the wait.
How can I help you?

40:49.720 --> 40:50.756
Hmm...

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
Oh.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.119
There you are.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.315
<i>Residents of
the Tri-state area were shaken up</i>

41:09.400 --> 41:11.278
<i>when a 5.9 magnitude tremor</i>

41:11.360 --> 41:14.512
<i>struck Washington Township, New Jersey
at about 7:30 a.m. local...</i>

41:14.680 --> 41:16.353
- Yo.
- Yo.

41:21.560 --> 41:22.880
Do you have that deck ready?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.878
E Corp guys
will be here any minute.

41:25.160 --> 41:26.958
- What?
- For the meeting.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.434
You just said "E Corp."

41:30.680 --> 41:32.034
Don't you mean "F Corp"?

41:32.760 --> 41:35.150
F Corp.
Yeah, that's what I meant.

41:35.480 --> 41:36.834
You nervous?

41:36.920 --> 41:38.752
You're never like this
before presentation.

41:38.840 --> 41:40.957
You're always stone cold.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.995
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm not myself today, man.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.753
What's up, my dudes?

41:48.920 --> 41:49.956
Ollie.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.176
Yeah, I heard
we were taking a swing

41:51.200 --> 41:52.953
at F Corp today, B-MOC.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.713
- I'm sorry?
- B-MOC.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.871
The Big Man on Campus.

41:59.360 --> 42:02.114
- I don't think that's a thing.
- It might be a stupid thing.

42:02.200 --> 42:03.680
Anyway, here's what's up.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.112
I'm awesome
at talking to people.

42:06.520 --> 42:07.590
For real, though.

42:07.680 --> 42:08.955
Lunches, dinners, drinks.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.874
I could sell ice to an Arab,
sand to an Eskimo.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.429
Yeah, you're not helping
yourself out there.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.880
Unless you're experimenting
with some new form of racism.

42:16.960 --> 42:20.715
I just want you to know I can be
an asset for when, not if,

42:20.800 --> 42:22.792
but when
you land this account.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.354
What do you say?

42:26.200 --> 42:27.953
You know what?
Don't take my word for it.

42:28.040 --> 42:30.953
I wanna take you out to lunch and
prove to you what I'm all about.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.394
But not today, though.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.591
I'm meeting my new girl,
Stella B.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.070
Shh. Don't tell
the girls in the office.

42:40.040 --> 42:41.918
Cool, man.
Glad we did this.

42:42.120 --> 42:43.395
Seriously.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.400
Just pull up the deck
and look over all the slides.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.416
<i>Let's build
our future together...</i>

42:49.440 --> 42:50.496
When you have lunch with him,

42:50.520 --> 42:52.830
can you please tell him
to never talk to me again?

42:52.920 --> 42:56.391
<i>Together, we can change
the world with F Corp.</i>

42:58.560 --> 43:00.995
<i>Zhi Zhang, the world's
richest person,</i>

43:01.080 --> 43:03.959
<i>continues to make news
for her philanthropic endeavors.</i>

43:04.040 --> 43:07.272
<i>Last month, Ms. Zhang
donated $4. 6 billion</i>

43:07.360 --> 43:10.432
<i>to her personal charity,
the Whiterose Foundation,</i>

43:10.520 --> 43:14.070
<i>according to a filing published by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</i>

43:14.320 --> 43:15.800
Earth to Elliot.

43:16.440 --> 43:17.874
You all right?

43:21.320 --> 43:23.710
Just make sure all
the flow charts are accurate.

43:24.400 --> 43:26.278
We really need
to land this account.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.320
Okay.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.400
<i>With Allsafe at the wheel,</i>

43:49.520 --> 43:51.876
F Corp can do
what they do best.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.350
Navigate the world
to a brighter future.

43:55.920 --> 43:57.434
Any questions?

44:01.920 --> 44:04.196
Can Elliot and I
have the room, please?

44:20.040 --> 44:22.760
I appreciate
your presentation,

44:23.320 --> 44:25.516
but I don't think
this place is right for us.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.360
And why is that?

44:38.160 --> 44:40.277
Let me ask you
something, Elliot.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.069
What's the worst thing
about your life right now?

44:46.200 --> 44:48.590
Well, the fact that
you're passing on us already,

44:48.680 --> 44:50.080
I'd have to go
with this meeting.

44:50.160 --> 44:51.640
No, seriously.

44:52.480 --> 44:53.800
Answer my question.

44:58.040 --> 44:59.520
If I'm being honest,

45:02.120 --> 45:03.998
the worst thing in my life

45:06.200 --> 45:08.237
is also the best thing.

45:10.400 --> 45:13.199
I get up every morning.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.913
I play my records.

45:16.760 --> 45:20.754
I get ready, get my coffee.
I come to work.

45:21.720 --> 45:25.873
I'm stuck in a repetitive,
boring routine

45:26.560 --> 45:28.233
that feels endless.

45:30.680 --> 45:34.151
And, sure, I've imagined
what it would be like

45:34.240 --> 45:37.756
to be someone
with a more exciting life.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.679
A risk-taker.

45:41.200 --> 45:43.317
Someone more interesting.

45:46.840 --> 45:50.436
But, in the end, I know
I'm lucky to be where I am.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.718
Please have a seat.

46:07.160 --> 46:10.995
I also feel the same
about my life at F Corp.

46:12.360 --> 46:15.194
It's the best and the worst
thing that happened to me.

46:17.600 --> 46:20.069
The reason why I love
my company so much

46:20.200 --> 46:22.271
is because of the value
we provide.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.473
People buy our products every day
because they trust us.

46:25.560 --> 46:27.438
F Corp is not only
the best thing in my life.

46:27.520 --> 46:29.477
It's the best thing in
everyone's lives,

46:30.040 --> 46:32.874
but it could also be
the cause of our undoing

46:33.360 --> 46:34.953
if I'm not careful.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.872
So you see my dilemma here.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.952
Tyrell, I pledge
to you right now

46:43.760 --> 46:45.752
that if you go with Allsafe,

46:46.400 --> 46:48.312
the worst will never happen.

46:50.760 --> 46:52.592
And how can you be so sure?

46:54.640 --> 46:58.077
Because I've seen what can happen
to your company,

46:59.400 --> 47:01.312
and I know how to prevent it.

47:02.960 --> 47:05.520
You've seen what can happen
to my company?

47:06.520 --> 47:08.239
Yes.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.634
If you look
through our packets,

47:11.720 --> 47:14.952
we've created predictive models
for every possible attack vector...

47:15.040 --> 47:16.394
No, no, Elliot.

47:17.480 --> 47:19.915
I just wanna know
you're on my side.

47:21.600 --> 47:23.080
Always.

47:28.000 --> 47:29.400
Come on, son.

47:29.680 --> 47:32.991
You just landed the biggest fish
there is, F Corp.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.558
Celebrate!

47:37.600 --> 47:39.239
Did you bring it?

47:47.280 --> 47:50.000
A signed first-edition copy,

47:50.200 --> 47:51.714
just like you asked.

47:59.640 --> 48:01.154
Shoot.

48:01.760 --> 48:04.798
I need to make sure Angela
isn't home when I drop it off.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.034
I think her mom's there.

48:16.280 --> 48:18.112
Hello? Emily?

48:21.240 --> 48:22.560
You there?

48:25.040 --> 48:26.394
Weird.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.071
She picked up, and then
she hung up on me.

48:31.800 --> 48:35.077
I bet she's with Angela and
doesn't wanna spoil the surprise.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.229
Come on.

48:37.480 --> 48:39.073
Let's order. I'm hungry.

48:42.760 --> 48:44.274
Forgot my wallet.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.672
Must have left it
at home this morning.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.439
That's not like you.

48:51.520 --> 48:52.874
Must be nerves.

48:57.440 --> 48:58.556
Okay.

48:59.280 --> 49:00.600
Here you go.

49:00.880 --> 49:02.678
You should buy her
some flowers, too.

49:03.480 --> 49:06.200
But first, we feast.

49:11.200 --> 49:12.919
So you'll
be gone for a while?

49:13.120 --> 49:15.316
<i>I already told you.
Why do you keep asking me?</i>

49:16.800 --> 49:18.200
No reason.

49:18.520 --> 49:19.840
<i>What are you up to?</i>

49:20.400 --> 49:21.675
Nothing.

49:23.640 --> 49:25.996
<i>You're up to something.
I can tell.</i>

49:27.080 --> 49:28.275
Trust me.

49:28.400 --> 49:29.914
<i>I trust you.</i>

49:30.000 --> 49:31.798
<i>I just don't believe you.</i>

49:34.880 --> 49:36.314
Your parents in town yet?

49:36.680 --> 49:38.399
<i>Yeah, they were just
at my place.</i>

49:38.520 --> 49:40.751
<i>I had to cancel lunch
with them because of work. Why?</i>

49:40.840 --> 49:42.797
Your dad sure loves to drink.

49:43.000 --> 49:44.354
<i>What's that?</i>

49:44.640 --> 49:45.994
Never mind.

49:46.520 --> 49:51.390
Hey, I'm sorry I was acting
weird this morning.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.469
Just really excited
about tomorrow.

49:56.120 --> 49:57.998
<i>What's tomorrow again?</i>

49:59.840 --> 50:01.069
Hmm.

50:02.440 --> 50:03.999
What could it be?

50:04.080 --> 50:08.552
<i>Well, um, I have a new Pilates
instructor I want you to try out.</i>

50:08.800 --> 50:10.792
I'm not a big Pilates guy.

50:10.880 --> 50:12.030
<i>Hmm, ooh...</i>

50:12.120 --> 50:14.794
<i>We're trying that new sushi place
in Chelsea finally?</i>

50:14.920 --> 50:16.639
Getting warmer.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.837
<i>We're finally getting married.</i>

50:21.240 --> 50:23.357
<i>That couldn't be it, could it?</i>

50:28.160 --> 50:29.719
Is the radio okay?

50:32.160 --> 50:33.560
Could you
actually turn it up?

51:24.160 --> 51:25.594
Who are you?
