WEBVTT

00:01.018 --> 00:04.088
So what do we got so far?
We need big-ticket items.

00:04.208 --> 00:05.408
I got the Red Hot Chili Peppers

00:05.409 --> 00:06.676
to send us a signed guitar.

00:06.710 --> 00:08.411
That's great, April.
How'd you do that?

00:08.445 --> 00:11.214
It's a long story,
but the short version is,

00:11.248 --> 00:13.649
I'm currently catfishing
Anthony Kiedis.

00:13.684 --> 00:15.985
We're throwing
a charity auction to raise money

00:16.018 --> 00:16.986
for the unity concert,

00:17.021 --> 00:18.855
and we're gonna need it too,

00:18.889 --> 00:20.857
if I'm gonna perform
<i>Islands In the Stream</i>

00:20.891 --> 00:23.226
with a Sacagawea hologram.

00:23.260 --> 00:24.994
Plus, we need
lights, generators,

00:25.028 --> 00:27.663
microphones, water,
that boring stuff too.

00:27.698 --> 00:28.898
Why don't we put a pin in this?

00:28.899 --> 00:30.666
'Cause we have to do that thing.

00:30.701 --> 00:31.934
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, okay.

00:31.969 --> 00:33.169
- All right, yep.
- Just, like--

00:33.203 --> 00:35.404
Everybody, keep working.
We'll be back.

00:35.439 --> 00:38.841
Andy, hey, you haven't told
anyone about the baby, right?

00:38.876 --> 00:42.578
No, but my brain
is about to explode from stress.

00:42.613 --> 00:43.893
I am not good
at keeping secrets.

00:43.914 --> 00:45.581
That's exactly what I told Kyle
when he told me

00:45.616 --> 00:46.816
his wife was cheating on him.

00:46.850 --> 00:49.552
- Andy, come on!
- Ah! See? Oh!

00:49.586 --> 00:51.621
- Not cool, man.
- Not him, not that Kyle.

00:51.655 --> 00:54.390
Okay, we are going to have
a doctor's appointment,

00:54.425 --> 00:55.792
and then after that,
we can probably tell people.

00:55.826 --> 00:57.059
So just hang in there, please.

00:57.094 --> 00:59.395
I can do this. People do this.
People keep secrets.

00:59.430 --> 01:01.831
My neighbor Eric--
he's kept a secret for 20 years.

01:01.865 --> 01:03.733
He's in Witness Protection.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.301
Okay.

01:05.334 --> 01:08.304

01:25.522 --> 01:27.790
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

01:27.825 --> 01:31.594
I need to ask you for a...

01:31.628 --> 01:32.728
favor.

01:32.763 --> 01:35.998
[Shouts] What?
Ron Swanson asking for help?

01:36.033 --> 01:38.901
Keep your voice down, woman!

01:38.936 --> 01:41.871
Part of the unity concert
is a youth revue

01:41.905 --> 01:43.673
about the history of Pawnee.

01:43.707 --> 01:45.842
They require volunteers,
so I want you

01:45.876 --> 01:48.611
to come with me
to my daughters'...

01:48.645 --> 01:51.047
public elementary school

01:51.081 --> 01:52.682
to help make costumes.

01:52.716 --> 01:54.517
The elementary school.

01:54.551 --> 01:56.752
I'll do you this solid,
but you're gonna have

01:56.787 --> 01:59.322
to keep an eye out
for my ex-boyfriend Joe.

01:59.356 --> 02:01.924
He teaches music at that school,
and he is a nightmare.

02:01.959 --> 02:04.260
- He's my Tammy.
- Your Tammy?

02:04.294 --> 02:07.997
Donna, my two ex-wives are
the worst people in the world.

02:08.031 --> 02:10.233
Tammy two once seduced a coroner

02:10.267 --> 02:12.201
and had me declared legally dead

02:12.236 --> 02:14.370
just so she could get a discount
on a plane ticket.

02:14.404 --> 02:15.772
When I'm with Joe,

02:15.806 --> 02:19.041
he turns me into a person
I don't like or recognize.

02:19.076 --> 02:20.476
I go insane.

02:20.511 --> 02:24.113
All I'm asking is for you
to keep him away from me.

02:24.148 --> 02:26.549
I understand this problem well

02:26.583 --> 02:30.520
and agree
to this exchange of services.

02:30.554 --> 02:33.456
We need to raise
a minimum of $30,000

02:33.490 --> 02:35.892
from the auction, or else the
concert's gonna be in trouble.

02:35.926 --> 02:39.195
What else can we auction off?
What about those fish?

02:39.229 --> 02:41.664
Think they're valuable?
Cover me.

02:41.698 --> 02:43.733
Maybe you should start
taking it easy.

02:43.767 --> 02:46.803
You're stressing out
for two now.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.038
Hmm, that's actually
a pretty decent t-shirt idea.

02:49.073 --> 02:51.207
Babe, I cannot slow down.

02:51.241 --> 02:52.575
The concert is in three weeks.

02:52.609 --> 02:54.811
Look, I feel fine,
and if you're worried,

02:54.845 --> 02:57.480
we can just ask Dr. Saperstein
what he thinks.

02:57.514 --> 03:00.283
Someone say "Saperstein"?
Come on, you two.

03:00.317 --> 03:03.219
Let's saddle you up
and put some jelly on the belly.

03:03.253 --> 03:05.254
- He's a little weird.
- Mm-hmm.

03:08.459 --> 03:09.892
- Look at me!
- Jeez.

03:09.927 --> 03:12.095
Okay, here's what's
happening--I want to auction off

03:12.129 --> 03:13.996
a personalized
Johnny Karate song tomorrow,

03:14.031 --> 03:15.665
so I need you to come
to the auction.

03:15.699 --> 03:16.966
[Sighs] Auction?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.434
Okay, yeah.
Let me write that down.

03:18.469 --> 03:21.704
Andy, you already have three
Johnny Karate shows tomorrow.

03:21.738 --> 03:23.539
No, not according
to my file here.

03:23.574 --> 03:26.042
Oh, I forgot, other hand.
Crap.

03:26.076 --> 03:27.777
Okay, we need a better system.

03:27.811 --> 03:30.313
Look, I'll just write down
an itinerary for you,

03:30.347 --> 03:31.614
so you can just focus on songs.

03:31.648 --> 03:33.382
Okay, well, you have
to catalog all this stuff.

03:33.417 --> 03:34.684
I mean,
this is hours' worth of work.

03:34.718 --> 03:36.185
What is that?
"Don't tell secret"?

03:36.220 --> 03:37.787
Oh, no, that's not one.

03:37.821 --> 03:39.956
Andy, if you have a secret,
you have to tell me.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.023
That's the whole point
of marriage.

03:41.058 --> 03:42.291
You get twice the secrets.

03:42.326 --> 03:45.395
Dude, it is nothing.
I don't have anything.

03:45.429 --> 03:46.529
I'm not acting weird.

03:46.563 --> 03:48.464
You're acting weird.
Excuse me.

03:48.499 --> 03:52.068
I have to get back to work now.

03:52.102 --> 03:53.703
[Breathing heavily]

03:53.737 --> 03:57.039
[Saw whirring]

03:57.074 --> 03:58.040
What are you doing?

03:58.075 --> 03:59.442
I'm getting a picture of you

03:59.476 --> 04:01.477
volunteering
at a public elementary school

04:01.512 --> 04:04.814
in case I ever need
to blackmail you.

04:04.848 --> 04:06.082
That's Joe, 12:00.

04:06.116 --> 04:08.317
Donna, how are you?

04:08.352 --> 04:10.920
- It's really nice to see you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:10.954 --> 04:12.188
Thank you so much
for helping out.

04:12.222 --> 04:14.624
These kids are so lucky to have
your fashion expertise.

04:14.658 --> 04:17.527
Hello, Joe.
My name is Ron Swanson.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.661
I am Donna's
work-proximity associate.

04:19.696 --> 04:22.765
Oh, my gosh, Donna has told me
so much about you.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.734
It's nice to put a face
to the name.

04:24.768 --> 04:26.636
Mm-hmm.
[School bell rings]

04:26.670 --> 04:29.439
Well, I gotta get back
to my classroom.

04:29.473 --> 04:31.741
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Ron.

04:31.775 --> 04:33.643
And if either of you guys
need anything at all today,

04:33.677 --> 04:35.311
please do not hesitate
to ask, okay?

04:35.345 --> 04:37.413
- I'm onto you, friend.
- What?

04:37.448 --> 04:39.015
Tread lightly.

04:39.049 --> 04:41.050
Okay.

04:42.553 --> 04:44.287
Now, Ben wants me to slow down,

04:44.321 --> 04:46.155
but I have this huge project
coming up,

04:46.190 --> 04:49.358
and slowing down
isn't really my jam.

04:49.393 --> 04:51.194
Your body is going
through some changes,

04:51.228 --> 04:52.995
but you're a healthy gal,
right, Leslie?

04:53.030 --> 04:55.431
There is no reason for you
not to be yourself.

04:55.466 --> 04:56.799
[Laughs] I win.

04:56.834 --> 04:59.035
- It wasn't a competition.
- All right.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.937
Let's see what's going down
in baby town.

05:00.971 --> 05:02.271
[Beep]
[Leslie and Dr. Saperstein gasp]

05:02.306 --> 05:03.539
There's your healthy baby.

05:03.574 --> 05:05.975
Oh, wow.

05:06.010 --> 05:08.544
Oh, and there's another one.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.613
The baby has two bodies?

05:10.647 --> 05:13.382
Twins.
Ben, we're having twins.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.952
[Laughs]

05:15.986 --> 05:18.988
No, you're not, 'cause look
who's hiding over here.

05:20.357 --> 05:23.025
Triplets?
Triplets?

05:23.060 --> 05:25.228
And here's a fourth.
I'm so sorry, no.

05:25.262 --> 05:26.863
It's a little fleck
of cream cheese on the screen.

05:26.897 --> 05:29.132
- [Sighs]
- Just triplets.

05:29.166 --> 05:31.467
Wow, you guys really dodged
a bullet.

05:31.502 --> 05:34.203
Can you imagine raising
four children at one time?

05:34.238 --> 05:36.839
Ha, a nightmare.

05:36.874 --> 05:40.455
- Triplets.
- Triplets.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.426
I can't believe it.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.459
We knocked it out of the park
on the first try.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.351
If we do this right,
we can be parents

05:48.471 --> 05:50.472
to 1/3 of the supreme court!

05:50.506 --> 05:53.275
- This is insane.
- This is amazing.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.876
I always knew
we were one in a million,

05:54.911 --> 05:55.911
and now we got the proof!

05:55.962 --> 05:58.014
Well, actually, one in 8,000.

05:58.134 --> 06:00.983
Triplets occur a lot more
frequently than you imagine,

06:01.017 --> 06:02.251
- especially at your age.
- Oh.

06:02.285 --> 06:05.674
Your body is prone
to releasing multiple eggs.

06:05.794 --> 06:07.456
It's what we doctors
like to call--

06:07.490 --> 06:09.238
and I don't mean
to be insensitive--

06:09.436 --> 06:11.704
a going-out-of-business sale.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.774
So, doctor, um,
what do we--

06:14.808 --> 06:17.777
like, what do we do?
Like, what do we do?

06:17.811 --> 06:21.014
Um, how do we--
how--how--how--

06:21.048 --> 06:23.078
how--
what do we do?

06:23.198 --> 06:25.485
The first thing you do is,
you forget everything

06:25.519 --> 06:27.353
that I said before
because you, young lady,

06:27.388 --> 06:31.791
need a lot of rest
and especially avoiding stress.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.260
Leslie, I need you to be
Buddha on quaaludes,

06:34.295 --> 06:35.828
and, Ben, you are

06:35.863 --> 06:38.498
Matthew McConaughey in a hammock
on the beach.

06:38.532 --> 06:42.001
All right, all right.
All right.

06:42.036 --> 06:44.470
This is insane.
Three kids?

06:44.505 --> 06:47.006
I just multiplied all
our future expenses by three,

06:47.041 --> 06:48.341
and you know what happened?

06:48.375 --> 06:50.543
The numbers got a lot higher.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.578
I think I heard the computer
laugh at me.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.981
And Saperstein wants us
to relax?

06:55.015 --> 06:57.450
Are you ready to go,
my gentle dove?

06:57.484 --> 07:01.354
Oh, I will be there in
two flaps of a butterfly's wing,

07:01.388 --> 07:03.389
and I love you.

07:05.326 --> 07:07.627
We are so [bleep] screwed.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.898
- [Crying]
- Uh-oh.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.400
What did you do now, Joe?

07:14.435 --> 07:16.035
Thank you so much.

07:16.070 --> 07:17.971
We thought we were gonna have
to tell Dylan

07:18.005 --> 07:19.606
that his doggie
was gone forever.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.640
Oh, my gosh.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.475
Barbara, don't even mention it.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.844
Look, I hate it
when my students are upset,

07:24.878 --> 07:27.013
so I just went out,
driving around.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.414
I checked
a few neighborhood parks.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.183
It took barely six hours.

07:30.217 --> 07:32.018
Oh, how can we ever repay you?

07:32.052 --> 07:34.187
No need.
Would you like a muffin?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.256
I made them last night.

07:38.626 --> 07:40.860
It's the best muffin
I've ever had.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.328
You're welcome, guys.

07:42.363 --> 07:44.564
You're welcome. Oh.
[Patting on the back]

07:46.333 --> 07:48.034
So whose birthday is it anyway?

07:48.068 --> 07:49.402
Oh, who knows?

07:49.436 --> 07:51.604
I got so many kids
from different women,

07:51.639 --> 07:53.239
I just get all of
their birthdays out of the way

07:53.274 --> 07:56.075
one day a year.

07:56.110 --> 07:57.710
Ladies.
[Clears throat]

07:57.745 --> 07:59.178
Okay, so when this ends,

07:59.213 --> 08:00.747
we have a half hour
to get to the next party.

08:00.781 --> 08:02.815
That gives us
15 minutes of travel time

08:02.850 --> 08:05.170
and 15 minutes for you to take
a wet-nap shower in the car.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.720
- Good, I need one.
- Also, tell me your secret.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.623
Babe, don't make me tell.
I don't wanna break my promise.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.859
Tell me now.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.560
Oh, jeez, this is heavy.
Pardon me.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.529
It's about Larry.

08:16.564 --> 08:19.566
He is very sick.
He has some kind of disease.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.069
Oh, so that's why
you've been so nice to him

08:23.103 --> 08:24.470
and let him carry
all your stuff.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.607
Yes, that's the reason.
Good call, babe.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.909
[Clatter]

08:29.944 --> 08:31.611
Jeez.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.712
Poor guy.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.481
Hello, everyone.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.818
Thank you all for coming to
this wonderful and calm event.

08:39.852 --> 08:44.424
Our first item up for bid is
two all-access V.I.P. passes

08:44.458 --> 08:45.592
to the unity concert.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.493
Let's start the bidding at $40.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.295
Do I hear 40?

08:49.330 --> 08:51.965
Thank you. 40.
We can beat this. 50.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.334
Anyone for 50?
$50. Thank you, sir.

08:54.368 --> 08:55.568
Terrific.

08:55.603 --> 08:58.071
Any higher?
No?

08:58.105 --> 08:59.238
Well, that's fine.

08:59.273 --> 09:02.141
We're all just
calm and happy people

09:02.176 --> 09:04.110
enjoying ourselves together
on earth.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.180
Sold for $50.
How magnificent.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.148
Leslie, that's less
than face value.

09:09.183 --> 09:11.584
You need passion,
zeal, showmanship.

09:11.619 --> 09:12.619
I don't have the gavel,
so I'm powerless.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.420
I respect the hierarchy
of the auction!

09:14.455 --> 09:15.755
I think
Leslie's doing a great job.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.156
Thank you, Craig.
Hey, are you doing all right?

09:17.191 --> 09:18.224
- Yeah.
- You want to do some tai chi?

09:18.258 --> 09:19.325
- No, I'm doing really fine.
- Okay.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.361
Leslie is already
the queen of stress,

09:21.395 --> 09:24.931
so I have to be like
her stress shamwow.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.834
I wrap myself around her,
I soak up all of her stress,

09:27.868 --> 09:29.068
and then
after the kids are born,

09:29.103 --> 09:31.704
someone can squeeze me out
into a bucket.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.039
- Ron!
- Ron!

09:33.073 --> 09:34.107
Ron, play with us!

09:34.141 --> 09:35.542
- Okay.
- Ron, play with us.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.477
Girls, Ron's got
sharp tools now.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.178
- Oh, Ron!
- Ladies.

09:39.213 --> 09:42.582
♪ Eyes are watching,
ears are listening ♪

09:42.616 --> 09:45.285
♪ lips are closed,
hands are still ♪

09:45.319 --> 09:47.320
All: # feet are very quiet #

09:47.354 --> 09:50.890
♪ you should really try it,
listen well, listen well ♪

09:52.960 --> 09:55.328
That was well played.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.631
Children their age respond
positively to melody and rhyme.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.832
They are great girls.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.569
You must feel very lucky
to be their stepdad.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.905
I do, indeed.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.307
If you'll excuse me, Joe,

10:07.341 --> 10:10.343
I have to finish hogging out
the cheeks on these lap joints.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.513
Oh, maybe you could use
this jig I made.

10:13.547 --> 10:14.948
It's just
a hardwood clamping block

10:14.982 --> 10:16.349
connected to a small piece
of hackberry.

10:16.383 --> 10:19.519
You could use it to locate your
cuts for the inside shoulder...

10:19.553 --> 10:22.088
Both: Without having to reset
the fence.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.457
Exactly.
[Laughs]

10:24.491 --> 10:28.027
Muffin?

10:29.697 --> 10:31.698
Thirsty there, big guy?

10:31.732 --> 10:35.168
Well, jeez, yes.
Thank you so much.

10:35.202 --> 10:37.570
Do you remember the time
when you put sleeping pills

10:37.605 --> 10:39.572
in my soda?

10:39.607 --> 10:41.240
I fell right over in the middle
of a town hall meeting.

10:41.275 --> 10:43.876
Mm, no.
I don't remember that.

10:43.911 --> 10:47.714
You made a video of it and
showed it at my birthday party.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.908
Yes, it went over really big.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.385
Well, I'm sorry.

10:52.419 --> 10:55.555
Is there anything I can do
to make it up to you?

10:55.589 --> 10:56.789
That's very sweet.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.758
Yeah, um, I have got an itch

10:58.792 --> 11:00.260
that I have not been able
to get to all day,

11:00.294 --> 11:02.462
and even against the wall,
nothing will do it.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.464
- Would you mind doing that?
- No, not at all.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.233
Just--if you could, like--
okay, go up.

11:07.268 --> 11:09.736
Go up the back.
[Groans]

11:09.770 --> 11:10.770
Hey, Ben.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.240
Can I just please tell
just April?

11:14.275 --> 11:16.009
I am hanging on by a thread
over here.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.745
No, just--look,
everyone's healthy and fine,

11:18.779 --> 11:20.480
but it's complicated.
There's a lot going on.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.081
So just don't say anything
to anyone

11:22.116 --> 11:23.683
about anything forever, okay?

11:23.717 --> 11:25.618
[Larry grunting]

11:25.653 --> 11:26.919
Andy?

11:26.954 --> 11:28.321
You can say "Okay."

11:28.355 --> 11:30.924
Okay. Bye.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.158
I didn't mean to say "Bye."

11:32.192 --> 11:34.627
Our next item up for bid
is the naming rights

11:34.662 --> 11:36.329
for our children's tent,

11:36.363 --> 11:39.299
so let's start the bidding
at $1,000, please.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.667
I'll bid 100 bucks.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.803
1,000?
Anyone want to--

11:43.837 --> 11:45.538
Oh, thank you, madam.

11:45.572 --> 11:47.974
A very wealthy
and elegant-looking woman

11:48.008 --> 11:49.709
with a diamond-encrusted
eye patch just raised her hand.

11:49.743 --> 11:50.977
Don't look at her.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.879
She doesn't like attention,
but she's there.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.215
She's real.
So do I hear 2,000?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.851
Ooh, yeah, here we go.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.853
The sheik has thrown his hat
into the ring.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.322
- Well...
- There's no sheik.

12:02.356 --> 12:03.690
It looks like we've got
a real bidding war between...

12:03.724 --> 12:05.325
There's no bidding war.
No one's talking...

12:05.359 --> 12:06.693
- An elegant--
- 'Cause there's no sheik,

12:06.727 --> 12:07.961
and there's no old lady
with a diamond--

12:07.995 --> 12:09.329
what is it, a diamond eye patch?

12:09.363 --> 12:10.997
- 3,000, says the gentleman...
- There's no 3,000.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.498
With the crazy hat
and a monkey on his shoulder.

12:12.533 --> 12:15.034
- It's 100 bucks. It's my bid.
- That is outrageous.

12:15.069 --> 12:16.402
That's the only bid out there
right now.

12:16.437 --> 12:18.705
Naming rights for the kids' tent
go to Jamm Orthodontics

12:18.739 --> 12:21.374
for 100 smackers.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.576
Now that is
the steal of the day.

12:23.611 --> 12:25.211
I think it's going great.
You want a head massage?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.013
Okay.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.216
So, um, Andy told me
what's going on.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.218
Really?
Oh.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.854
I was trying
to keep it hush-hush.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.422
It's kind of embarrassing.

12:36.457 --> 12:39.192
Well, if you ever need to talk
to anyone, I'm here for you.

12:39.226 --> 12:44.264
Or, like, you know, I'm here,
standing near you.

12:44.298 --> 12:47.166
Well, earlier today, I was
licking icing off of my finger,

12:47.201 --> 12:50.203
and then, boom,
I swallow my wedding ring.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.237
And I wish I could say
it was the first time, but--

12:52.239 --> 12:53.206
Wait, wait, wait.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.409
So you're not, like, dying?

12:56.443 --> 12:59.245
No, no, no, I mean,

12:59.280 --> 13:00.480
can it be painful?

13:00.514 --> 13:01.781
Sure, but the good news is,

13:01.815 --> 13:03.215
I've gotten very good
at passing it.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.785
It's just a matter
of getting out the old colander.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.720
Come on, Pearl, jump in.

13:07.755 --> 13:09.989
Don't make me pull the permits
on your rental units.

13:10.024 --> 13:11.891
Hey, all the paperwork
on those buildings

13:11.926 --> 13:13.159
are under my dog's name,

13:13.193 --> 13:15.194
so if you got a problem,
take it up with Princess.

13:15.229 --> 13:17.830
Honey, why don't you take
a whale-sounds break, okay?

13:17.865 --> 13:19.332
I'll finish this up.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.633
Guys, come on, now.

13:20.668 --> 13:23.202
This is signed
by the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

13:23.237 --> 13:25.738
Just think
about all their great songs,

13:25.773 --> 13:27.340
covering everything
from the culture

13:27.374 --> 13:28.741
of Southern California

13:28.776 --> 13:31.711
to drug use
in Southern California.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.379
- I'll bid 30 bucks.
- Okay.

13:33.414 --> 13:36.616
This is easily worth $500.
Come on.

13:36.650 --> 13:38.084
Please, anyone.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.286
We're just trying to raise
some money for this concert,

13:40.321 --> 13:42.922
- so no one gets stressed out.
- Fine.

13:42.957 --> 13:47.226
50 and another win
for Old Herman.

13:47.261 --> 13:48.428
Why would you erase
the signatures?

13:48.462 --> 13:50.063
I'm more of a Jack Johnson guy.

13:50.097 --> 13:51.264
Okay, give it back.

13:51.298 --> 13:52.532
If you want it so bad,
bid on it.

13:52.566 --> 13:55.034
I don't like
the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

13:55.069 --> 13:56.869
It's not even
the original lineup.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.071
- Give it back!
- [Grunts]

13:58.105 --> 14:00.273
[Screams] Ben!

14:00.307 --> 14:02.408
It's okay. I'm fine.
Stay relaxed.

14:02.443 --> 14:03.977
Oh, my God,
there's blood everywhere.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.245
Call a doctor!
No, call a coroner!

14:06.280 --> 14:07.883
It just got insane!

14:10.596 --> 14:12.063
You have very weak hands.

14:12.097 --> 14:13.097
Why would you say that?

14:13.098 --> 14:14.632
Just making an observation.

14:14.666 --> 14:16.434
Poor Ben.

14:16.468 --> 14:19.503
You know the EMT said that
if flea had sent you his bass,

14:19.538 --> 14:20.504
you could've lost a thumb.

14:20.539 --> 14:22.173
I'm totally fine, babe.

14:22.207 --> 14:25.343
Everything is
a-okay coolio beans.

14:25.377 --> 14:27.378
- You want to meditate real quick?
- No, we do not have time.

14:27.412 --> 14:30.381
We have a concert to save.
Excuse me, he's feeling better.

14:30.415 --> 14:33.050
He can go, right, Ann?
Damn it.

14:33.085 --> 14:34.285
I wonder
if I'll ever stop doing that.

14:34.319 --> 14:36.887
Come on.

14:36.922 --> 14:39.557
I honestly don't care,
but I'm just gonna say it.

14:39.591 --> 14:40.758
I like Joe.

14:40.792 --> 14:43.194
He's a nice man
who's good with kids,

14:43.228 --> 14:44.996
and he seems to be
smart and patient.

14:45.030 --> 14:47.231
I know.
That's why he's my Tammy.

14:47.266 --> 14:48.833
I'm a social butterfly.

14:48.867 --> 14:51.602
When we're together,
all we do is have sex,

14:51.637 --> 14:53.571
sit on the couch,
eat homemade pasta,

14:53.605 --> 14:55.306
- have sex again.
- Enough.

14:55.340 --> 14:57.108
He's constantly
being respectful,

14:57.142 --> 15:00.611
wanting to spend time with me,
trying to "connect" with me.

15:00.646 --> 15:03.114
It's a nightmare.
I become boring.

15:03.148 --> 15:06.317
Live your life how you want,

15:06.351 --> 15:10.288
but don't confuse drama
with happiness.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.090
So I've been talking to Larry,

15:13.125 --> 15:14.725
and he's definitely not dying.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.560
Technically, we're all dying,

15:16.595 --> 15:18.796
unless you choose
the right grail.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.131
It's the dusty one.

15:20.165 --> 15:22.433
Andy, I was nice to Larry.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.936
I scratched his back.
I had a conversation with him.

15:24.970 --> 15:26.871
It was horrible.
How can you do that to me?

15:26.905 --> 15:30.041
Fine.
I'll tell you the secret.

15:30.075 --> 15:32.109
- Ben's dog is dying.
- Lie.

15:32.144 --> 15:35.179
Ben is dying--he has
the same disease Larry has.

15:35.213 --> 15:36.480
- Leslie is dying.
- No.

15:36.515 --> 15:37.782
- They're both dying.
- No.

15:37.816 --> 15:39.817
I'm dying.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.953
- Chris and Ann are moving.
- They already moved.

15:41.987 --> 15:46.324
They're moving again
to China...town in France.

15:46.358 --> 15:47.792
- No!
- Okay, fine.

15:47.826 --> 15:49.226
- Do you really want to know?
- Yes.

15:49.261 --> 15:51.295
- Leslie is a spy.
- No.

15:51.330 --> 15:52.891
Tom has something wrong
with his butt.

15:52.898 --> 15:54.098
- Oh, my God.
- What?

15:54.132 --> 15:55.499
Did you hear that?
They need an encore.

15:55.534 --> 15:57.535
Honey, they want--the kids
want an encore, I'm sorry.

15:57.569 --> 15:59.136
What song should we do?
You wanna do <i> Toots?</i>

15:59.171 --> 16:01.606
I hope you don't mind,
but I noticed that

16:01.640 --> 16:03.074
your right rear tire
was a little flat,

16:03.108 --> 16:05.810
so I patched it,
and I inflated it for you.

16:05.844 --> 16:07.712
But you're still gonna want to
go to a garage 'cause I don't--

16:07.746 --> 16:09.380
- I like to do things.
- Excuse me.

16:09.414 --> 16:12.083
Museums, opera, nightclubs.

16:12.117 --> 16:15.486
Sometimes I disappear for a day
or two 'cause I'm fly-fishing

16:15.520 --> 16:17.355
or I'm at a Seattle Sounders game.

16:17.389 --> 16:20.191
I promise not to cheat on you

16:20.225 --> 16:24.462
if you promise not to try
to pin me down too fast.

16:24.496 --> 16:26.797
I have no problem with that.

16:26.832 --> 16:29.066
You can take me
to dinner Friday.

16:29.101 --> 16:31.469
I have only one request--

16:31.503 --> 16:34.205
that you wear
that, uh, red thing.

16:34.239 --> 16:35.439
I'll wear that red thing

16:35.474 --> 16:40.411
when you deserve to see me
in that red thing.

16:40.445 --> 16:43.147
[Clears throat]
Gotta go make some muffins.

16:43.181 --> 16:45.082
Okay, there's still
plenty of ways

16:45.117 --> 16:46.984
to raise money
for the concert, right?

16:47.019 --> 16:48.653
Maybe we'll win the lottery.

16:48.687 --> 16:49.987
I mean, hey,
you're looking at a woman

16:50.022 --> 16:52.089
who just hit triple cherries
in her uterus.

16:52.124 --> 16:53.491
We're screwed.

16:53.525 --> 16:55.326
No, we're not, we have
three weeks until the concert.

16:55.360 --> 16:57.094
- It'll be fine.
- No, not the concert.

16:57.129 --> 16:58.896
The triple cherries.

16:58.931 --> 17:00.451
I mean, of course
it's the most amazing

17:00.465 --> 17:02.233
and wonderful thing
to ever happen,

17:02.267 --> 17:03.567
but, okay, I am an accountant,

17:03.602 --> 17:06.871
and I am looking
a cold, hard facts.

17:06.905 --> 17:11.108
Raising three kids
is going to cost $2 million.

17:11.143 --> 17:12.843
Babe, our kids will be geniuses.

17:12.877 --> 17:14.211
They'll get scholarships.

17:14.246 --> 17:16.480
Half of my tuition was paid for

17:16.515 --> 17:19.450
by the Indiana scholarship for
pretty blondes who like to read.

17:19.483 --> 17:22.520
It's now called the Virginia
Woolf prize--different time.

17:22.554 --> 17:25.423
Leslie, I have been trying
so hard not to stress you out,

17:25.457 --> 17:27.290
but we just spent
our entire savings account

17:27.326 --> 17:29.760
on a trip to Paris.

17:29.795 --> 17:30.962
What were we thinking?

17:30.996 --> 17:32.597
We spent too much money
on macaroons.

17:32.631 --> 17:33.798
Okay, honey--

17:33.832 --> 17:35.032
Okay, wait, what's the number
for the Louvre?

17:35.067 --> 17:36.347
I mean,
maybe I can get a refund.

17:36.368 --> 17:37.568
We barely looked
at the <i> Mona Lisa.</i>

17:37.603 --> 17:39.570
Honey, can you just breathe
for a second?

17:39.605 --> 17:40.605
Leslie, these numbers are
going to determine everything

17:40.639 --> 17:41.606
for the rest of our lives!

17:41.640 --> 17:42.974
- Breathe.
- I mean,

17:43.008 --> 17:44.241
maybe we should move because
we could make more money,

17:44.276 --> 17:45.643
or maybe we should stay here

17:45.677 --> 17:47.278
because it's cheaper
to live here than in Chicago.

17:47.312 --> 17:48.546
Oh, my God!

17:48.580 --> 17:49.981
I'm shamwowing
all of your stress,

17:50.015 --> 17:51.215
and there's no one here
to wring me out.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.683
- Benjamin Wyatt...
- I don't even know--

17:52.718 --> 17:56.521
The man of my dreams,
the one that I love, shh.

17:56.555 --> 17:57.795
Leslie, we are in trouble here.

17:57.823 --> 17:59.323
We are in real trouble!

17:59.358 --> 18:01.459
- [Laughs] I'm so sorry.
- What?

18:01.493 --> 18:03.928
You just look so crazy
right now, but cute.

18:03.962 --> 18:07.798
You're always stressed out.
How are you calm right now?

18:07.833 --> 18:09.967
Because I realized something.

18:10.002 --> 18:11.602
Everything that
we have been through--

18:11.637 --> 18:14.572
the harvest festival,
the election, the recall,

18:14.606 --> 18:16.240
the merger, Ann leaving,

18:16.274 --> 18:19.310
Larry changing his name
for some stupid reason--

18:19.344 --> 18:23.681
all of it has just been
preparation for this.

18:23.715 --> 18:27.251
I am immune to stress
because I have you.

18:29.154 --> 18:31.789
Come on.
I have an idea.

18:34.274 --> 18:35.608
[Scraping]

18:35.642 --> 18:38.244
Ron is King Sparkle
of Cupcake Forest.

18:38.278 --> 18:40.813
Much obliged.
[Ivy and Zoe laugh]

18:40.847 --> 18:43.682
So I'm going to dinner
with Joe next week.

18:43.717 --> 18:45.417
Glad to hear it.

18:45.452 --> 18:46.418
It's always nice to see someone

18:46.453 --> 18:47.753
actually change for the better.

18:47.787 --> 18:50.089
Yes, Joe seems like a good man,

18:50.123 --> 18:52.191
but at this point,
I'm done talking about him.

18:52.225 --> 18:53.759
I was talking about you.

18:53.793 --> 18:55.728
Your family has made you
a more patient

18:55.762 --> 18:57.596
and empathetic person.

18:57.631 --> 18:59.965
- You take that back.
- Come on, Swanson.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.534
Did you think even two years ago

19:01.568 --> 19:03.035
you'd be playing matchmaker
for me

19:03.069 --> 19:04.670
while wearing a glittery crown?

19:04.704 --> 19:05.938
Now you're a dad.

19:05.972 --> 19:08.074
You care a little, itty bit
about your friends.

19:08.108 --> 19:11.310
You're King Sparkle
of Cupcake Forest.

19:11.344 --> 19:13.445
It suits you.

19:21.321 --> 19:23.989
Andy, the camo is not working.
I can see you.

19:24.024 --> 19:26.992
- [Sighs] Damn, really?
- Yes.

19:27.027 --> 19:28.727
Babe, you don't have
to hide from me.

19:28.762 --> 19:31.063
I don't care about the secret
anymore, okay?

19:31.097 --> 19:33.098
I just thought,
when we got married,

19:33.133 --> 19:34.500
we would share everything,

19:34.534 --> 19:37.469
but if you really can't tell me
or whatever, it's fine.

19:37.504 --> 19:38.737
I trust you.

19:38.772 --> 19:41.640
It's just that
it's a really big secret,

19:41.675 --> 19:44.610
and for once,
I wanted to keep my word.

19:44.644 --> 19:45.744
But screw it.

19:45.779 --> 19:47.413
You're more important
than anything.

19:47.447 --> 19:48.647
I'm gonna tell you

19:48.682 --> 19:50.182
'cause it's super juicy--
you ready?

19:50.217 --> 19:51.617
Okay.

19:51.651 --> 19:53.419
Everybody,
if you could gather around...

19:53.453 --> 19:56.155
They're here--don't try
to get it out of me anymore.

19:56.189 --> 19:57.823
The reason
I have been acting so weird

19:57.857 --> 19:59.325
is not because I've been waiting

19:59.359 --> 20:02.027
for the results of
the soil samples to come back.

20:02.062 --> 20:03.996
Well, jeez, I've been up
all night trying to make sure--

20:04.030 --> 20:05.197
It doesn't matter, Larry.

20:05.232 --> 20:06.699
It was a pointless ruse designed
to waste time.

20:06.733 --> 20:10.469
The truth is...
I'm pregnant.

20:10.504 --> 20:11.971
[All cheering]

20:12.005 --> 20:14.507
Yes, I did it!
I kept a secret.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.774
Congratulations.

20:15.809 --> 20:17.877
I'm sure you will both
raise a wonderful child

20:17.911 --> 20:21.180
with whom I will profoundly
disagree on nearly everything.

20:21.214 --> 20:23.349
Well, actually,
and this is crazy,

20:23.383 --> 20:25.851
but it's children, plural.

20:25.886 --> 20:28.220
- We're having triplets, and...
- Shut the--

20:28.255 --> 20:29.321
- Oh, my God!
- A little freaked out about it.

20:29.356 --> 20:30.489
That's amazing.

20:30.524 --> 20:32.358
Babe, I am so glad
you didn't tell me.

20:32.392 --> 20:33.959
I know.
I'm incredible.

20:33.994 --> 20:35.394
Okay, now listen to me, you two.

20:35.428 --> 20:37.730
Gayle and I have kept everything
our girls ever used,

20:37.764 --> 20:40.332
so we have, like, millions
of clothes and strollers and--

20:40.367 --> 20:42.401
- just don't buy a thing, okay?
- A triple crib--

20:42.435 --> 20:44.904
sounds like an interesting
woodworking challenge.

20:44.938 --> 20:47.172
Would you like oak or pine?

20:47.207 --> 20:48.707
I'll make both,
and you can choose.

20:48.742 --> 20:50.609
My boyf--
my friend Joe

20:50.644 --> 20:52.177
has the hookup
at all the good preschools.

20:52.212 --> 20:54.380
Andy and I can babysit anytime,

20:54.414 --> 20:56.482
except for on weekends
and nights,

20:56.516 --> 20:58.050
but we're free anytime
during work hours.

20:58.084 --> 21:01.253
This is gonna be
the happiest time of your life!

21:01.288 --> 21:03.122
Well, I sold everything
on the auction list,

21:03.156 --> 21:04.523
no thanks to you people.

21:04.558 --> 21:06.158
What's so wonderful
that you're all celebrating

21:06.193 --> 21:07.893
while I do all the hard work?

21:07.928 --> 21:09.328
We're having triplets.

21:09.362 --> 21:11.931
[Laughter]
Oh, great.

21:11.965 --> 21:14.400
First my cousin Winona
gets into a car accident

21:14.434 --> 21:16.535
the night my one-man show opens,
and now this?

21:16.570 --> 21:18.904
Why are my accomplishments
always overshadowed?

21:18.939 --> 21:22.775
Congratulations, I suppose.

21:22.809 --> 21:23.876
That's nice of him.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.350
- Yeah, yeah, I'll take that.
- Yeah.
