WEBVTT

00:02.569 --> 00:04.302
- Oh, uh... Excuse me.

00:04.372 --> 00:06.371
(distant honking)

00:06.374 --> 00:08.240
(inhales sharply)
- oh...

00:09.843 --> 00:11.510
- Hey, how's it feeling?
- It's not great.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.246
- First positions,
please. Quickly.

00:14.315 --> 00:15.914
Our opening performance
is tonight.

00:15.983 --> 00:17.750
Please at least pretend
it matters.

00:17.885 --> 00:21.253
And... Five, six,
seven, eight, sway.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.487
Two, three, four...

00:22.556 --> 00:25.824
Six, seven and one,
one, two, two.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.861
And out. A-one-two-two.
Very good. Flick, flick!

00:28.863 --> 00:30.662
Slow, slow and flick one,

00:30.664 --> 00:33.165
Flick two, flick...

00:33.300 --> 00:34.532
Can I help you?

00:34.568 --> 00:36.868
(piano music stops)

00:36.904 --> 00:38.804
(dancers sighing)
are you going to say something

00:38.939 --> 00:40.739
Or are you watching a free show?
- Mary shaw.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.975
Toronto morality officer.
- What an absolutely
dreadful job.

00:44.011 --> 00:46.378
(instructor sighs)
why are you here?

00:46.513 --> 00:49.748
- Ah, well, I've received
a complaint that this show

00:49.750 --> 00:54.886
Is in violation of the city
of toronto's morality standards.

00:54.922 --> 00:56.621
(exhaling heavily)

00:56.690 --> 00:59.457
(tense music)

00:59.493 --> 01:00.626
Oh, you, ah--
you can't do that!

01:00.761 --> 01:03.095
- That's funny. I just did.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.763
(inhales deeply)

01:06.634 --> 01:07.766
(exhales heavily)

01:07.835 --> 01:09.367
I should think the way
that you're leering at jerome

01:09.403 --> 01:11.603
Is also in violation
of morality standards.

01:12.639 --> 01:13.972
- I'll be serving notice
that you refused

01:14.108 --> 01:16.108
To honour the--
- I'm too busy for
this conversation.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.510
If you want to continue it,
you can have it with the
owner of the theatre.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.746
- Where could I find him?
- He's right behind you.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.115
- Officer shaw!
- Mr. Pembroke.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.917
- What can I do for you?
- You bought a theatre?

01:25.986 --> 01:29.054
- I--I have.
- Well... I'm afraid

01:29.123 --> 01:31.256
To inform you
that these dancers' costumes,

01:31.258 --> 01:33.391
They're in violation
of a number of city ordinances.

01:33.393 --> 01:34.460
They'll--they'll have
to be changed.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.328
- Are you crazy?
The show's tonight.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.263
- If you refuse to comply,
I'll have to put a poster

01:38.265 --> 01:40.398
In the door alerting
the public to the immorality

01:40.468 --> 01:41.667
Occurring in here.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.601
- Art isn't immoral.
- Be that as it may,

01:43.637 --> 01:47.005
Just cover up the dancers.
- I can't afford new costumes,

01:47.041 --> 01:48.874
Not before we've
even sold a ticket.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.342
- Ah, wallace,
the show is sold out.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.211
- Yeah, you--you know
what I mean! Every dime

01:52.346 --> 01:53.478
That I've made so far
has gone into miss hart's

01:53.547 --> 01:56.982
Eight weeks of rehearsal.
- Excuse me? Miss rita hart?

01:58.018 --> 01:59.751
- Yeah.
- I thought that she was

01:59.753 --> 02:01.620
In new york.
I didn't realize that was her!

02:01.755 --> 02:04.823
- Well, she's trying
something new.

02:04.825 --> 02:08.060
Something... Artistic.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.362
Left vaudeville
just to join her;

02:10.497 --> 02:12.431
Biggest mistake I ever made.
- Mistake?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.633
Standing room only is a mistake?

02:14.702 --> 02:16.168
- That woman is nothing
more than a royal pain

02:16.237 --> 02:18.102
In my backside.
- Look, put up your poster

02:18.139 --> 02:20.572
If you want, but this show is
going on, miss shaw.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.809
- And! And da-da-da-da-da.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.712
- You want to see more?
Buy a ticket.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.647
- I'll get you one
for half price.
- Really?

02:28.782 --> 02:31.250
- I'm a friend of the law.

02:31.385 --> 02:34.453
- All right. I will come back
with my poster. Rita hart.

02:34.455 --> 02:36.088
Golly!

02:36.223 --> 02:38.223
- Oh!
- Oh, no.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.759
- Are you ok?
- Oh, my gosh! Is she all right?

02:40.761 --> 02:44.596
- Happens all the time, ok?
Uh, now if you'll excuse us...

02:44.731 --> 02:46.064
This rehearsal is closed.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.167
(indistinct speaking)

02:49.937 --> 02:52.471
- I'm ok. Ah.
(upbeat jazz music)

02:52.473 --> 02:55.406
- (rita): From the top,
everyone!

02:55.442 --> 02:57.342
(theme music)

02:57.477 --> 03:00.479
(woman scat singing)

03:20.500 --> 03:22.300
- (man): Order up!
(service bell dinging)

03:22.336 --> 03:24.836
- Boyzey pembroke bought
capitol theatre?

03:24.838 --> 03:27.973
- Mm-hm. And he said he could
get us half-off tickets.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.642
And, gals, we have to go.
Rita hart?

03:30.678 --> 03:32.377
She is like nothing
you've ever seen.

03:32.413 --> 03:34.579
- Didn't you give them a ticket
for indecency?

03:34.582 --> 03:36.281
- Well, a warning.
And they can still perform.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.450
They just have
to change the costumes.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.985
- Where did boyzey get the cash
to buy capitol theatre?

03:40.054 --> 03:41.987
- Isn't that his thing,
buying and selling properties?

03:42.122 --> 03:43.922
- I mean, he owns some of the
shops my brother delivers to,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.391
But, I mean, owning a theatre,
that's different.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.659
- Well, that would explain
the ticket price.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.329
Four bucks a pop. That's steep.
- I'm sure

03:50.331 --> 03:52.130
Miss hart's manager had
something to do with that.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.465
All he did was complain about

03:53.534 --> 03:55.667
How terrible she is
at managing money.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.269
- You know what? I'm going
to ask him about this. Frankie,

03:57.271 --> 03:59.905
I'll see you back at the office.
- You got it.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.206
- That was quick.
- Well, boyzey fails,

04:02.243 --> 04:03.942
It doesn't look good
for any black entrepreneur.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.411
- True. Or maybe she just wanted
to see boyzey?

04:06.546 --> 04:08.012
- (frankie): Yeah. I think so.

04:08.048 --> 04:11.816
Well, I have somewhere to be.
I'll see you girls later.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.818
- Oh.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.620
- Well, I guess lunch is over.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.455
- Maybe I should go down
to the theatre and check on

04:17.491 --> 04:19.291
That dancer?
- Miss hart says she's fine.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.059
There's nothing we have
to worry about.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.828
- Well, if the great
rita hart says.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.496
- Flo, she is a genius.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.831
I am telling you...
There is no one

04:26.900 --> 04:28.767
Who understands
the human body better than her.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.436
- Mary, I gotta say I never
pegged you for a dance lover.

04:31.505 --> 04:35.039
It's so... Loose,
and you're so...

04:35.075 --> 04:38.043
Not.
- Well, dance is very strict.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.946
And then the challenge is
to make it look loose.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.182
I used to take dance lessons
when I was a kid.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.452
My parents thought I just liked
the tutus, but, really...

04:47.488 --> 04:49.587
It was the only place
I really felt like myself.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.156
- Why'd you stop?

04:52.259 --> 04:54.926
- No, it doesn't matter.
Morality officers don't dance,

04:54.995 --> 04:57.862
Do they? But they can watch.
- Hm!

04:57.898 --> 04:59.263
(flo chuckles)

04:59.300 --> 05:01.466
(lively jazz music)

05:14.014 --> 05:16.615
- "king capitol: Ward mogul

05:16.617 --> 05:20.752
Makes riskiest bet yet." doesn't
sound like a vote of confidence.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.355
- Trudy clarke.
What are you wearing,

05:23.490 --> 05:26.158
Silk slippers these days?
I forgot we had a lunch date!

05:26.160 --> 05:29.027
- We don't. A theatre?

05:29.029 --> 05:30.161
That's ambitious, even for you.

05:30.197 --> 05:31.697
- Exciting, isn't it?

05:31.832 --> 05:34.366
This venture is going to put
toronto on the map.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.134
- For what? Weird dances?

05:36.136 --> 05:38.903
- Ok. How can I help you, trudy?
- I don't know anyone

05:38.939 --> 05:41.039
Who would lend that kind
of money to people like us,

05:41.041 --> 05:43.841
But I do know it's not the bank.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.577
- That's correct.
- So, I'm guessing

05:45.579 --> 05:48.313
You put up all your properties
in the ward as collateral.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.816
- And then some.
- You know, if you fail,

05:50.951 --> 05:53.318
Lady justice isn't going to just
show up and forgive your loans.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.787
- She won't have to.
Think about it.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.123
People who go to the theatre

05:58.192 --> 05:59.925
Also go out to eat
before the show.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.727
- Ok.
- And they buy

06:01.862 --> 06:04.796
Clothes for the event.
Doesn't your mother mend furs

06:04.865 --> 06:07.466
For the uptown society ladies?
A theatre like this

06:07.601 --> 06:09.868
Will be a boon for everybody.
- You especially.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.570
- I sure hope so.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.071
It's all I ever wanted.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.206
And to impress
the trudy clarkes of the world.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.342
- You mean lady justice.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.078
Save your charm for her
because it doesn't impress me.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.748
- You sure about that?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.551
You do look a little impressed.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.687
(sultry jazz music)

06:30.957 --> 06:33.225
- Ok. That should do it.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.162
Next time, I'm going to have
to charge you my full price.

06:37.231 --> 06:39.964
- As long as I don't have to
hire that dandy race car driver.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.735
- Well, he is very expensive.
- Oh.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.772
- Put in new spark plugs,
gave you an oil change,

06:46.907 --> 06:49.241
But you should probably get in
to see a real mechanic
at some point.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.842
- Where does
a private detective learn

06:50.878 --> 06:52.711
How to fix rusty old trucks?

06:52.713 --> 06:54.980
- The war.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.916
- Well, you're full
of surprises, aren't you?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.484
- Frankie!

07:00.587 --> 07:03.922
- There you are!
I was just finishing up here.

07:03.991 --> 07:06.992
Ah! Thank you!
Those are beautiful.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.862
- Hey, alessandro.
Hell of a mechanic you got here.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.664
- Yeah. She's full of surprises.
(chuckles)

07:13.700 --> 07:15.800
- Funny, that's what I said.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.102
Drake, thanks again,
for the, uh,

07:18.138 --> 07:20.004
Oil change and the spark plugs
and everything.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.540
- Any time!

07:23.143 --> 07:25.877
- So you are changing oil
for your neighbours now?

07:25.946 --> 07:28.213
- Just helping out a friend.

07:28.215 --> 07:31.483
- You know, frankie, I know
a thing or two about cars, huh?

07:31.552 --> 07:33.618
(car backfires and drives)

07:33.620 --> 07:35.887
(frankie chuckles)
next time, please,

07:35.923 --> 07:37.088
Leave it to me.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.757
I'll fix your friend up
real nice.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.159
- I don't mind the practice
for when I don't have

07:41.228 --> 07:42.627
A pro around.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.696
(light piano music)

07:46.166 --> 07:49.166
- I'm starving. How 'bout you?
- Me, too.

07:49.203 --> 07:51.569
- Oh, my!
Thank you for--so sorry.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.071
I beg your par...
(indistinct chatter)

07:55.042 --> 07:56.841
- (man): Nuts?
Nuts are not a snack

07:56.844 --> 07:58.777
Unless they're
in a cookie or a loaf cake.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.512
- (boyzey): Some of these are
covered in chocolate.

08:00.514 --> 08:03.147
- You're saying you spent
my money on a snack stand?

08:03.217 --> 08:05.717
- Audiences like to eat.
Wh--it's another revenue stream

08:05.719 --> 08:08.452
For the theatre!
- The only revenue I want is

08:08.489 --> 08:11.389
From the interest on the loan
I gave you. Or do I need to
remind you what happens

08:11.425 --> 08:15.060
If those payments don't come in?
- Ah, sorry to interrupt. Um,

08:15.195 --> 08:18.096
Perhaps this is a good time
to revisit the morality

08:18.098 --> 08:20.598
Violations we discussed earlier?
- It's actually not a good time.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.468
- What violations?
- Well, uh, I still

08:23.470 --> 08:26.338
Require a signature agreeing
that the theatre will abide

08:26.340 --> 08:28.673
By morality standards.
- Can we talk about
this later, mary?

08:28.808 --> 08:32.477
- No, no. I'd actually like
to hear what miss...

08:32.546 --> 08:35.980
Mary in red has to say.
- It's officer shaw.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.682
Make these changes,
or I'll be forced to declare

08:37.751 --> 08:39.751
This establishment immoral.
- Officer shaw,

08:39.753 --> 08:41.953
I'm very interested
in discussing this and more

08:42.022 --> 08:44.322
With you, if you'll just
excuse us for one moment.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.160
- All right. I'll just
stand out--out here.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.595
- Yeah.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.064
Yeah, just out there. Yeah.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.434
(indistinct conversation)

08:56.570 --> 08:58.570
(pensive piano music)

09:11.585 --> 09:12.384
(inhales sharply)

09:12.519 --> 09:13.585
- Oh! Miss hart!

09:13.654 --> 09:15.787
Oh, miss hart!
Are you all right?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.524
- Lights!
(clanking)

09:23.564 --> 09:26.531
- Uh... I thought you might be
hurt like that other dancer.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.466
- Yes, well that other dancer
doesn't concern

09:28.535 --> 09:30.935
The virginity police
or whatever you are.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.038
- All right.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.273
Well, I beg your pardon.
I--I didn't mean to interrupt.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.809
- Are you here to arrest me
for my scandalous costumes?

09:37.944 --> 09:41.346
- No! No, no.
I mean, not exactly.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.381
I can't arrest you.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.753
I think you're wonderful.
That's all.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.288
- I don't think that's all.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.026
- Sorry, I don't know
what you mean.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.227
(chuckles)

09:56.363 --> 09:59.297
- I mean the body
does not keep secrets.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.567
You should stay
and observe our rehearsal.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.004
But do not interrupt.

10:06.073 --> 10:07.639
No.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.843
(miss hart sighs)

10:13.380 --> 10:15.547
(door creaks)

10:15.682 --> 10:18.049
- How did it go
with king capitol?

10:18.085 --> 10:21.252
- Leveraged to a loan shark.
So, you know, there's that.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.655
- That is risky,
even for boyzey.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.390
(trudy sighs)
think it's going to work out?

10:26.426 --> 10:27.859
- I don't know.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.028
But a lot of people'll get hurt
if it doesn't.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.131
- Maybe we should go
check it out.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.366
Mary was so scandalized

10:35.402 --> 10:37.936
By those male dancers,
now I'm curious.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.771
- I thought you and alessandro
were going steady?

10:39.773 --> 10:42.407
- Yes! Going steady,
not going blind.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.242
(laughing)

10:44.311 --> 10:46.477
(pensive piano music)

10:46.513 --> 10:50.248
- (miss hart): Don't over-point
your foot, justine.

10:51.485 --> 10:54.018
Look like a human being.
- Officer shaw!
- Ooh!

10:54.087 --> 10:55.486
- Prudence mayfair.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.088
I see the immorality warning

10:57.157 --> 10:59.290
I requested has not yet been
posted on the door.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.960
- Yes, mrs. Mayfair,
your morality complaint is

11:01.962 --> 11:03.728
Being addressed.
Everything is under control.

11:05.499 --> 11:08.432
- What on earth is this filth?
- The movement must come

11:08.468 --> 11:11.102
From the pelvis. Yes!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.837
Feel the pelvis!
Feel the pelvis!

11:12.972 --> 11:15.440
- I see my concerns regarding
these degenerates

11:15.509 --> 11:16.708
Have gone ignored.
- No, no, no.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.311
Nothing has been ignored.
I can explain about all of this.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.180
- I'm telling you,
give me 24 hours and
I'll have your money,

11:23.216 --> 11:25.316
Plus interest.
- I swear to god, I'm pulling

11:25.385 --> 11:26.818
Out of this pony show,
you don't cut the crap!

11:26.887 --> 11:28.720
- Watch your language, sir!

11:28.722 --> 11:30.288
- Who the hell's this tomato?

11:30.290 --> 11:33.390
- Mary... You were right.

11:33.427 --> 11:36.428
The clothing-to-skin ratio on
these dancers is very becoming.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.397
- Apologies, everyone!
Keep moving.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.732
Ok? There's nothing to see here.
- We will resume rehearsal

11:41.768 --> 11:43.868
Once we stop being
constantly disturbed.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.471
Officer shaw, this is
highly improper!

11:46.473 --> 11:49.541
- Yes! Everyone shush! There is
a dance rehearsal in progress.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.275
Why don't we
continue this outside?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.044
- Oh!
(dancers gasping)

11:56.383 --> 11:57.816
- Are you ok?

11:57.818 --> 11:59.451
- Uh, yeah. I'm fine.
- Well, where

11:59.586 --> 12:01.486
Does it hurt?
- My stomach.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.321
It hurts to--
(inhales sharply)

12:03.390 --> 12:05.490
...To breathe.
- Frankie, what is it?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.892
- I've seen this before.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.161
(dramatic music)

12:10.296 --> 12:12.296
(gunfire)

12:12.332 --> 12:14.899
(coughing and wheezing)

12:14.935 --> 12:18.169
(sombre martial music)

12:27.747 --> 12:30.782
(gasps)
you're burning up.
Who have you been

12:30.784 --> 12:32.917
In contact with?
(inhales sharply)

12:33.052 --> 12:35.987
Stay back.
- What?

12:35.989 --> 12:37.922
- Boyzey, cancel
the show tonight.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.525
- Ah!
- Mary,

12:40.594 --> 12:42.627
Stay here and do not let
anybody leave.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.062
- Frankie! Slow down. What's up?

12:44.064 --> 12:45.830
- The spanish flu is what's up.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.866
(dramatic music)

12:58.611 --> 12:59.944
You should wash
your hands, trudy.

13:00.079 --> 13:02.013
- Frankie, hold up.
- We need to call the police.

13:02.148 --> 13:05.216
- You want to call the police?
That's a first.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.385
- We should alert the public.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.621
- You don't even know for sure
that it's the spanish flu.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.424
You looked at that dancer for a
second. What if you're wrong?
- An outbreak in the city

13:13.493 --> 13:15.193
Would be a disaster.
- And if we call this wrong,

13:15.262 --> 13:17.495
That will be a disaster.
People will panic;

13:17.564 --> 13:20.030
They'll shutter their doors!
You already shut down

13:20.066 --> 13:22.233
Boyzey's opening night.
That's damage enough.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.501
- We can't risk starting
another pandemic just to save

13:24.538 --> 13:26.437
Boyzey's theatre.
- We don't know what's going on.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.373
Let's just make sure, ok?

13:29.576 --> 13:32.109
- Fine. But if anyone leaves
that theatre--

13:32.179 --> 13:33.878
- I doubt mary would let
that happen.

13:33.947 --> 13:36.314
(phone receiver clatters)

13:36.316 --> 13:39.516
- Mary. Mary, tell me
this doesn't have

13:39.553 --> 13:40.919
To do with costumes.
- It doesn't.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.253
- Then, for god's sake,
why am I closing

13:42.289 --> 13:45.122
My theatre on opening night?
- That dancer? She has...

13:45.158 --> 13:47.792
- What? What, what, what mary?
- It's the spanish flu.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.394
Frankie thinks that it's
the spanish flu. It's back.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.928
- How would she know?
- She's seen it before.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.131
Up close.
- We've all seen it before.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.999
Is she going to the police?
- She should!

13:55.134 --> 13:57.068
- No! Ah, lord!
This is a disaster.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.270
I'll lose everything. Damn it!

13:59.272 --> 14:00.738
- Boyzey, it is one night.

14:00.807 --> 14:02.607
If it's not the flu, then we
have nothing to worry about.

14:02.742 --> 14:06.077
Until then, we have to stay put.
Hey! Hey, you! No one leaves.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.346
- I heard what the blonde said.
There's no way I'm sticking

14:08.481 --> 14:10.148
Around this cesspool.
And you're still on the hook.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.549
- Smith!
- This is a matter
of public health.

14:12.586 --> 14:15.219
- Screw public health.
I got a wife and kids at home.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.455
No pretend police is gonna
stop me from giving--

14:17.590 --> 14:19.290
- On authority of
the ontario public health act,

14:19.425 --> 14:21.359
I will charge you
with endangerment

14:21.361 --> 14:24.161
Of social hygiene
and venereal disease.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.296
They fall under
the same umbrella.

14:25.431 --> 14:28.766
That's a $20 fine, or 21 days
in jail. You pick.

14:28.768 --> 14:32.103
(cheerful jazz music plays)
- great timing, trudy. I am off

14:32.238 --> 14:34.439
In five and I am
dead ready for a gin.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.640
(laughing)

14:35.775 --> 14:37.041
- What do you know
about the spanish flu?

14:38.011 --> 14:40.311
(record scratches)
(music stops)

14:40.446 --> 14:43.447
- Why? Who is it
and what are their symptoms?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.917
- It's one of the dancers
at the capitol. Uh, dry heaving,

14:45.919 --> 14:47.852
Complaining of stomach pains,
couldn't breathe.

14:47.921 --> 14:49.721
- Is it the same one that mary
told us about at lunch?

14:49.856 --> 14:51.722
- No, it's a different one.
(exhales heavily)

14:51.758 --> 14:53.725
Will you help?
(phone ringing)

14:53.727 --> 14:55.993
- In '18,
after the first outbreak,

14:56.029 --> 14:58.329
I was drafted
by the ontario sos,

14:58.365 --> 15:00.398
The sisters of service.
If we didn't tend

15:00.467 --> 15:02.399
The flu victims,
they would kick us

15:02.435 --> 15:04.335
Out of our rooms
at the boarding house.

15:04.470 --> 15:06.471
They didn't give us
much choice, but they did

15:06.606 --> 15:09.807
Give us free workshops
in medicine.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.610
That's how I got my start.
Let me grab some things.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.948
- Put this on and don't take
it off unless I say so.
- Ok.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.350
- Has frankie alerted
the police?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.452
- No. Not yet.
- What?

15:21.587 --> 15:24.822
- We cancelled the show, but we
want to make sure it's the flu
before we sound the alarm.

15:24.824 --> 15:26.891
- Avoiding mass hysteria.
Good thinking.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.893
Grab me one of those sheets.
You know what? Grab me two.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.529
We're gonna need them.

15:34.801 --> 15:37.302
- So, uh...

15:38.505 --> 15:41.572
...Technical difficulties.
Um, unfortunately,

15:41.708 --> 15:44.308
There's been
some oversight in the delivery

15:44.344 --> 15:46.244
Of the equipment required
for the performance tonight,

15:46.379 --> 15:48.245
So...
- It was the lights, wasn't it?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.448
I told you we didn't need
any more damn lights!

15:50.583 --> 15:51.916
- The lord will judge you
for that language.

15:52.051 --> 15:54.518
- No, no it isn't a lighting
issue, exactly. It's, ah--

15:54.554 --> 15:55.919
- Why don't you tell them
the truth, huh?

15:55.956 --> 15:58.255
We're stuck here
'cause all your, uh,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.857
Your dancers got
the spanish flu.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.126
We're all contaminated,
and none of us is going

16:02.128 --> 16:04.395
Anywhere any time soon!
Ain't that right, pembroke?

16:04.431 --> 16:05.996
- This woman...

16:06.032 --> 16:08.065
With somewhat
ambiguous authority, has said

16:08.101 --> 16:11.602
It's the flu. Fine.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.538
But if it is not the flu,
then the show must go on.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.140
And if the show must go on,

16:16.275 --> 16:17.942
Then we must continue
to rehearse!

16:18.011 --> 16:19.544
- With all due respect, rit--
- I've always said

16:19.679 --> 16:21.245
That a dancer's--
- here we go.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.548
- I've always said
that a dancer's gift is to do

16:24.617 --> 16:26.817
What the body is
capable of doing.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.352
Our fellows,
coraline and justine,

16:28.355 --> 16:31.288
Exemplify strength
of body and spirit

16:31.324 --> 16:33.958
And, so, with rest,
will do what any human is

16:33.960 --> 16:36.027
Capable of doing,
which is recover.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.696
- The lord condemns
your lustful dancing bodies!

16:39.733 --> 16:41.899
You'll have to answer to him
on judgment day.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.700
- If I ever have the pleasure of
meeting my maker, I'll be sure

16:43.737 --> 16:47.504
To thank him profusely
for gifting me this
body to dance with.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.107
- Wallace!
- Maybe she's right.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.377
Maybe we need to cut our losses
and do something a little bit

16:53.413 --> 16:56.514
More mainstream.
- Your losses, wallace.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.516
I haven't lost anything.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.051
Although I wouldn't mind
getting rid of you.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.120
- Believe me,
the feeling is mutual.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.522
- Well, great!
Go back to vaudeville then.

17:04.524 --> 17:05.823
You should have never have left!

17:05.892 --> 17:08.126
(indistinct chatter)

17:09.996 --> 17:13.831
- Their morals are so diseased
their bodies are following suit.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.334
- Perhaps you'd be
more comfortable in the lobby,

17:17.404 --> 17:19.870
Mrs. Mayfair?
- Please, call me prudence.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.940
- I beg your pardon, prudence.
- And, no, I am...

17:22.942 --> 17:26.077
Absolutely comfortable
right here.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.012
So are you, miss shaw.

17:28.147 --> 17:31.449
"the lord knoweth how to rescue
the godly from trials."

17:32.619 --> 17:35.286
We have nothing to worry about.

17:35.421 --> 17:36.387
(sombre piano music)

17:38.825 --> 17:40.825
(distant whistle blowing
and missile flying)

17:43.797 --> 17:46.097
(gunfire)

17:52.839 --> 17:54.572
- (muffled): Frankie!

17:57.911 --> 17:58.910
Frankie.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.182
- What are you doing here?
- We have a date, bella.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.685
Frankie, is everything ok?

18:09.589 --> 18:11.255
- No.
(breathing shakily)

18:13.660 --> 18:15.926
One of the dancers
at the capitol is

18:15.962 --> 18:18.029
Showing symptoms
of the spanish flu.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.799
- Well, how can you tell?
- I saw it hundreds of times

18:22.836 --> 18:26.069
Back in '18.
All the symptoms are there and--

18:26.106 --> 18:27.805
And when I touched
her forehead--

18:27.874 --> 18:30.508
- You touched her?
What were you thinking?

18:30.510 --> 18:32.477
- I was just doing my job.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.411
- You--you didn't
think to tell me?!

18:34.447 --> 18:35.880
- To tell you what?
- I don't know, frankie!

18:35.949 --> 18:37.782
Maybe that you are contaminated?

18:39.686 --> 18:43.287
(speaking italian)

18:43.289 --> 18:45.456
- Alessandro!
(receding footsteps)

18:46.893 --> 18:49.560
(sighs)
(door shuts)

18:49.596 --> 18:51.562
- It's nice.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.365
That's it.
And then all you need to do...

18:54.434 --> 18:57.568
Just open yourself up...
To the emotion.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.306
Come on!

19:04.844 --> 19:06.177
Enough. Take a break.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.779
Take a break! Get off!
(dancer sighs)

19:08.815 --> 19:10.581
(indistinct chatter)

19:14.921 --> 19:16.854
- I thought that was wonderful.

19:17.924 --> 19:20.224
- Well, it was lifeless. So...

19:21.794 --> 19:24.061
- I think they're
doing their best.
- No, they're not.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.864
And now they're all...
Riddled with fear, so...

19:26.933 --> 19:29.666
I don't know. I...
- Aren't you afraid, too?

19:29.702 --> 19:30.668
- No.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.806
This troupe has allowed me to do
what I've always been destined

19:35.842 --> 19:38.876
To do, which... Is...

19:38.945 --> 19:42.880
Translate human emotion
into movement

19:43.015 --> 19:46.250
And then... Share it
with the world.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.753
And that's enough for me.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.291
If the flu must take me,
then let it come.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.760
- (wallace): It can't
take you just yet.

19:56.996 --> 20:01.199
We still gotta cash in
on our return to vaudeville.

20:05.071 --> 20:07.638
Rita hart and the return act!

20:07.674 --> 20:10.507
- Over my dead body.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.309
(wallace sighs)

20:12.345 --> 20:15.646
Break's over! Return to stage.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.481
(knocking)

20:21.721 --> 20:22.987
- Hello?

20:23.056 --> 20:25.088
(mary sighs)
I can't let you in here.

20:25.124 --> 20:26.657
I'm sorry. It's not safe.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.126
- I appreciate your concern,
mary, but those dancers need

20:29.128 --> 20:30.927
A medical professional,
so open up.

20:30.964 --> 20:33.297
- It's ok, mary.
We have supplies.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.968
- All right. Come in.
(soft sombre music)

20:41.608 --> 20:42.740
- Hey.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.776
We have to wear these now.
Doctor's orders.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.546
Turn around.
Flo knows what she's doing.

20:49.548 --> 20:52.049
- All right. So, ah,
where's frankie?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.485
She's going to keep quiet
about the "you know," right?

20:54.487 --> 20:56.687
- Yes. She's back at the office.

20:56.689 --> 20:59.423
She's going to keep quiet
for the next 24 hours.

20:59.425 --> 21:01.558
- Ok.
- But, if it is the flu,

21:01.560 --> 21:03.394
We have to warn people.
- Yeah, yeah. Of course,

21:03.529 --> 21:04.695
It's the right thing to do.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.563
You know, I've run
the numbers and it turns out

21:06.633 --> 21:09.933
That one missed show, maybe two,
isn't going to sink us, so...

21:09.969 --> 21:11.635
I might weather this yet.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.371
- And what if she's right?
You--you're not worried?

21:14.407 --> 21:16.306
- Yeah. Of course, I'm worried.
- If something happens to me,

21:16.342 --> 21:18.241
I don't know what
my family will do.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.645
- Oh, well. What's possibly
going to happen to you?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.179
You're surrounded by penny
candies and dust bunnies.

21:22.248 --> 21:24.915
(trudy laughing)
- right!

21:24.984 --> 21:27.184
Ok, open one up!
- All right.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.521
(trudy laughs)
- yes!

21:30.656 --> 21:32.456
Do you remember that time

21:32.458 --> 21:34.024
When, um...
- You mean how your mother was

21:34.027 --> 21:35.792
Convinced that we survived
the flu because of...

21:35.828 --> 21:38.329
- (both): Cabbage,
onion and oxo.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.531
(both laughing)
- yeah.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.801
Ah. Yes.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.569
- Bon appétit.
(trudy laughs)

21:45.605 --> 21:48.005
- Why do they all look
like they're in pain?

21:48.074 --> 21:50.007
- Well, that's called
a contraction.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.810
It's... A basic expression
of human emotion.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.978
- Uh-huh. Where do I find
the sick ones?

21:55.048 --> 21:57.415
- Oh, uh, there and back there.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.083
Honestly, they haven't stopped
dancing since they fell.

22:00.119 --> 22:02.420
Is it possible
that frankie overreacted?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.822
- Frankie has seen this
up close and so have I.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.023
She has a reason
to be worried! Hey!

22:07.060 --> 22:09.159
Excuse me!

22:09.228 --> 22:11.695
I need to examine
those two dancers.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.631
(man groans)
and this one, too, apparently.

22:14.701 --> 22:15.933
(discordant piano notes)

22:16.068 --> 22:17.368
Come on!
(dancer coughing)

22:17.437 --> 22:20.705
There we go.
Park it there, young man!

22:20.840 --> 22:22.840
And you, there.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.308
And you there.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.210
- (trudy): What happened?
- Three sick dancers now.

22:27.513 --> 22:29.180
Oh! Ah, prudence,
you shouldn't be in here.

22:29.315 --> 22:31.849
- Don't mind me. I'm only
a witness to god's work.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.984
- I can keep going.
- I'm fine too.

22:34.020 --> 22:37.588
- Sit down! Trudy, I need
some water. And, mary,

22:37.590 --> 22:39.590
I have some sheets in my bag,
rip them up into pieces.

22:39.592 --> 22:42.660
Everyone needs a covering
on their face, now!

22:42.795 --> 22:44.395
It's coraline, right?

22:44.397 --> 22:47.064
(coraline coughing)

22:49.802 --> 22:51.602

22:54.006 --> 22:55.672
- I don't know.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.075
But from here on in,
everyone in here is quarantined

22:58.210 --> 23:00.010
And everyone wears a mask.

♪♪

23:04.751 --> 23:06.250
- Miss drake!

23:06.385 --> 23:08.218
What can you tell me
about the spanish flu outbreak

23:08.254 --> 23:09.754
And why are you covering it up?

23:21.534 --> 23:23.167
're talking about.

23:23.169 --> 23:25.836
- I'm talking about this, and
I quote, "everyone stay in here.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.906
This dancer has the spanish
flu." are those not your words?

23:28.908 --> 23:30.841
- Who told you that?
- I'm not prepared to say.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.477
Is it the spanish flu, frankie?

23:33.479 --> 23:36.347
- I don't know.
But none of those dancers are

23:36.482 --> 23:38.381
Leaving the theatre until I get
to the bottom of this.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.251
- They won't.
Not after I publish this.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.752
- Please don't.
- If it's the flu, frankie,

23:42.789 --> 23:44.387
Every moment is another life--
- I know that.

23:44.424 --> 23:47.324
I know probably better than
you do, but we don't know yet

23:47.326 --> 23:49.894
And we need to do
the responsible thing here.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.265
- Twelve hours.
- Until what?

23:54.267 --> 23:56.399
- The paper goes to print
twelve hours from now.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.401
That's the time you have.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.383
What are you doing here?

24:13.453 --> 24:15.819
- I'm observing
the dance rehearsal

24:15.822 --> 24:17.488
To make sure it's not indecent.
- I heard there's more

24:17.490 --> 24:20.824
Going on in there than that.
- I don't think so.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.092
- Are people sick in there?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.494
- Sick?
- Yes,

24:23.563 --> 24:25.396
Sick. Spanish-flu sick

24:25.398 --> 24:27.832
To be specific. Why won't you
tell me what's going on?

24:29.368 --> 24:31.268
- I'm sorry. I can't.

- Mary, please, you have
to get out of there.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.706
- Steven, you know
I can't do that.

24:35.775 --> 24:38.175
- For pete's sake,
use your head! You're in danger!

24:38.310 --> 24:40.577
- I am using my head better
than ever before.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.579
I know exactly what I'm doing

24:42.648 --> 24:44.748

24:48.921 --> 24:51.254
- Did you share
anything with justine?

24:51.290 --> 24:52.856
- Of course.
- Like what.

24:52.925 --> 24:56.126
- Food, sleeping quarters,
you name it.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.594
- How about you?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.330
- We all live
on top of each other.

24:59.465 --> 25:00.965
- When did you start
feeling ill?

25:01.100 --> 25:03.601
- A few days after I arrived
in toronto.

25:03.603 --> 25:05.468
- A few days.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.005
- Uh, mr. Smith!
Where are you going?!

25:08.007 --> 25:09.273
- I'm getting some air.
- I already told you,

25:09.408 --> 25:12.543
You cannot leave the theatre.
- I'm not leaving! All right?

25:12.545 --> 25:14.078
I'm not leaving. I'm just
going outside for a second

25:14.213 --> 25:16.146
To get some--
- no. No! We have a protocol.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.415
You are not allowed to leave--
- stop, woman!

25:18.451 --> 25:20.618
I'm just going outside
for a moment

25:20.753 --> 25:23.387
To get some air.
I'll be back!

25:26.259 --> 25:28.125
(knocking)

25:29.428 --> 25:31.929
(whistle blowing outside)
(car honking)

25:33.165 --> 25:34.431
- You came back.
- I couldn't let you deal

25:34.500 --> 25:35.766
With this alone.
- Thank you.

25:35.835 --> 25:37.501
- We have another problem.
- What's that?

25:37.570 --> 25:38.902
- Steven found out
what's going on.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.170
- Mary's steven?
- And he's threatening

25:40.172 --> 25:42.973
To publish the story.
Wonder how he found out.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.575
- And I just don't know
if I've made

25:44.644 --> 25:46.977
The right choices.
Or any choices, really.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.380
- But you wanted to be
what you are.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.715
- Well, I wanted to be
like my father.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.518
And don't get me wrong,
I do love my work.

25:54.520 --> 25:55.919
- But?
- But I'm nothing

25:55.922 --> 25:57.788
Like my father.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.857
And I'm starting to realize
I never will be.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.059
So, here I am
as a morality officer.

26:03.095 --> 26:06.663
I have no idea how I got here,
much less what I should do next.

26:06.732 --> 26:10.334
(cloth-tearing noise)
- ah. Thinking's overrated.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.702
You know what isn't?

26:13.005 --> 26:14.371
Movement.

26:17.409 --> 26:18.942
- Movement?

26:19.011 --> 26:22.613
- You will always reveal
what you feel in your heart

26:22.615 --> 26:24.615
By what you do
in your movement.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.119
- I don't understand.

26:31.157 --> 26:32.956
- I can tell by the way
that you move that you've got

26:32.992 --> 26:34.558
Something pent up
inside of you.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.594
And, maybe, it needs
to come out.

26:37.696 --> 26:40.130
I think you should try
moving more...

26:41.700 --> 26:43.634
...And thinking less...

26:45.638 --> 26:47.938
...To see what your body has
to say about the issue.

26:53.445 --> 26:56.046
- Well, that's not very helpful.
(footsteps)

26:56.181 --> 26:57.147
Ooh! Frankie!

26:58.484 --> 27:00.184
What are you saying?

27:01.587 --> 27:03.720
- He's your boyfriend.
Maybe you needed

27:03.789 --> 27:06.189
A sympathetic ear and it's
a great scoop for him--

27:06.258 --> 27:08.925
- No. I didn't need
anything like that.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.662
I want this show to go on,
probably more than anyone.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.864
I would never betray
your confidence like that.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.366
- I'm sorry. I'm just
tightly wound right now.

27:16.402 --> 27:18.868
- It's ok. I know the feeling.

27:18.904 --> 27:21.338
- Hey, guys.
This seem odd to you?

27:24.844 --> 27:26.443
- (frankie):
What's this? Aspirin?

27:28.313 --> 27:30.481
(gagging)

27:32.885 --> 27:33.750
(retching)

27:33.819 --> 27:36.086
- (flo): That's it.
Just let it out.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.088
- They are reaping
what they've sowed, you know.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.090
They've disrespected
the laws of god--

27:40.126 --> 27:41.624
- You might want
to put a sock in it, lady.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.895
- They will all recover if
they reject their wicked ways.

27:45.030 --> 27:46.296
- Didn't you hear me
the first time?

27:46.365 --> 27:48.232
- (trudy): Listen to her
and get out!

27:51.671 --> 27:53.170
- (frankie): How are they doing?

27:53.172 --> 27:55.139
- It's still just the three
of them showing signs.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.775
- It's something.
- They can't keep anything down.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.476
- Flo, we found these.

28:01.813 --> 28:05.248
- Acetylsalicylic acid.
That's a lot.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.051
This stuff ain't cheap.

28:08.187 --> 28:10.787
It's possible... Trudy,

28:10.823 --> 28:12.856
Can you find me some blueprints?
- Blueprints?

28:12.892 --> 28:14.725
- There must be some
for the theatre. Go ask boyzey.

28:14.727 --> 28:15.625
- Ok.

28:15.695 --> 28:17.194
- What do you mean
you're going home?!

28:17.263 --> 28:19.129
- Sorry, boyzey. I'm out.

28:19.165 --> 28:22.399
We're pulling up stakes.
This wasn't meant to be.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.934
- (rita): I'll be staying,
mr. Pembroke.

28:24.069 --> 28:26.136
- Oh... Yeah?
- Mm-hm!

28:26.172 --> 28:28.639
- Hm. Who's gonna pay
for your dancers?

28:28.774 --> 28:30.741
No money coming in means
no money going out.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.743
You're coming back
to vaudeville with me.

28:32.812 --> 28:35.412
Sorry, pembroke,
but, uh, your ship has sailed.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.548
- (boyzey):
You can't bail on me.
- (trudy): Boyzey...

28:37.683 --> 28:39.483
- (boyzey): What is it?
- (trudy): Do you have
blueprints to the theatre?

28:39.618 --> 28:41.685
- Trudy, this is
hardly the time!

28:41.820 --> 28:43.253
- I need them now.

28:44.289 --> 28:45.689
- Thank you.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.424
- This will be perfect.

28:47.559 --> 28:48.859
- Perfect.

28:49.928 --> 28:52.062
- (flo): Oh!
- (trudy): Here they are.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.563
- So, what's the plan, flo?

28:53.599 --> 28:55.765
- Blueprints are made
with a chemical transfer process

28:55.801 --> 28:57.634
That involves
ferrous ammonium citrate

28:57.770 --> 29:00.003
And potassium ferricyanide.
- (mary): Cyanide?

29:00.139 --> 29:02.605
Are we talking
about cyanide poisoning?

29:02.641 --> 29:04.007
- Nice try, but no.

29:04.009 --> 29:06.643
What I'm interested in
is the ammonium citrate.

29:06.679 --> 29:09.580
(woman moaning)
oh, geez.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.982
- (frankie): You keep
doing what you're doing.
I'll go check on her.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.851
- (flo): You sure?
- (frankie): Yeah, I'll be fine.

29:16.922 --> 29:17.955
- Ah...

29:21.393 --> 29:24.394
- Are you doing ok?
- Oh, it hurts everywhere.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.696
Oh...

- Mm-mm.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.868
- Can I get you
some water or anything?

29:30.870 --> 29:32.503
- Water makes it worse.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.272

any problems breathing?

29:47.787 --> 29:49.419
- So, what exactly
are you doing, flo?

29:49.421 --> 29:52.355
- If acetylsalicylic acid mixes
with ammonium citrate,

29:52.391 --> 29:54.958
It should turn violet.
- Which proves...?

29:54.994 --> 29:57.026
- It doesn't prove anything,
but it strongly suggests

29:57.062 --> 29:58.495
That these dancers
were poisoned.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.765
- With what?
- Acetylsalicylic acid. Aspirin.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.504
Jehosophat!
That is a lot of aspirin!

30:07.639 --> 30:09.173
- (frankie): Flo!
- I don't think that this is--

30:09.308 --> 30:11.575
- Spanish flu. No, neither do I.
The dancer that I just saw,

30:11.577 --> 30:13.176
There's no fever,
there's no respiratory problems.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.545
I think it's an ulcer.
- Maybe that's what's
wrong with the other two.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.781
- An ulcer. How?
- Aspirin overdose.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.315
- So, someone's trying
to poison the dancers?

30:19.351 --> 30:21.718
- Very possibly.
- Who-who would do that?

30:21.754 --> 30:24.621
- Maybe someone who doesn't want
to see them perform.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.324

taking aspirin

30:30.663 --> 30:33.697

journalist that was tipped off.

someone who poisoned a dancer

30:58.390 --> 30:59.623
