WEBVTT

00:01.117 --> 00:03.474
today would be the last day of school,

00:03.499 --> 00:05.855
but because Chicago had six snow days

00:05.899 --> 00:08.467
and our school adds those
on the end of the year,

00:08.535 --> 00:11.637
it is the sixth-to-the-last
day of school.

00:11.704 --> 00:12.838
What is happening?

00:12.906 --> 00:14.339
Is the A.C. not working?

00:14.407 --> 00:15.841
Why are you wearing a sweater?

00:15.909 --> 00:17.576
Because it completes the look,

00:17.644 --> 00:18.877
and I'm not willing to give that up

00:18.945 --> 00:21.880
just because Mom and Dad
won't fix the air conditioner!

00:21.948 --> 00:23.882
Ugh. I can't believe we have
to take the finals in this heat.

00:23.950 --> 00:27.419
And Irish people do not
handle heat attractively.

00:27.487 --> 00:28.687
I blame the heat

00:28.755 --> 00:30.722
on all the climate
deniers in the government.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.323
Is there any chance that school
would cancel finals this year

00:32.392 --> 00:33.592
because it's so hot?

00:33.660 --> 00:35.661
The school might, but
Mom wouldn't let them.

00:35.728 --> 00:37.696
Whew.

00:37.764 --> 00:40.666
Brain smoothie for you.
Brain smoothie for you.

00:40.733 --> 00:43.535
And before you ask, Jimmy,
no, it is not made of brains.

00:47.107 --> 00:50.209
I got to absorb as much
cool as possible before I go.

00:50.276 --> 00:52.277
I might put this chicken in my unders.

00:52.345 --> 00:54.580
Mom, can we please, please

00:54.647 --> 00:56.748
take a break from studying
after school and go to the lake?

00:56.816 --> 00:59.218
Absolutely not. You're
on lockdown all weekend.

00:59.285 --> 01:02.254
You kids are gonna turn
any minuses into pluses.

01:02.322 --> 01:04.423
Not the way Jimmy does it... with a pen.

01:04.491 --> 01:06.191
Morning, guys.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:15.635 --> 01:17.736
Is Dad wearing skinny jeans?

01:17.804 --> 01:19.805
Should we say something?

01:19.873 --> 01:21.807
Shh, shh, shh.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.108
- Hey, Dad.
- Mm?

01:23.176 --> 01:25.777
Could we please try and convince Mom

01:25.845 --> 01:28.126
to let us have the afternoon
off from studying for finals?

01:28.148 --> 01:29.348
Um, sorry, kids.

01:29.415 --> 01:31.375
Your mom and I are on
the same page on this one.

01:44.898 --> 01:46.098
Hey, can I get that for you?

01:46.166 --> 01:47.399
Yes, please.

01:52.408 --> 01:53.739
Do I still have to study?

01:53.806 --> 01:54.740
Give me the damn bagel.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.244
Hey, while I've got you...

01:59.312 --> 02:00.712
this door is swollen from the heat,

02:00.747 --> 02:02.080
- and it keeps sticking.
- Mm-hmm.

02:02.148 --> 02:04.283
Could you take a break from
sweating, try and fix it?

02:04.350 --> 02:06.919
Hey, we can't all will our
bodies not to sweat, like you.

02:06.986 --> 02:08.287
Can't or won't?

02:08.354 --> 02:09.854
Look, I'll look at the door,

02:09.923 --> 02:12.191
but I need to talk to you.

02:12.258 --> 02:15.093
Is it about your silly jeans?

02:15.161 --> 02:16.762
Styles have changed, Eileen.

02:16.829 --> 02:17.570
Okay.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.632
Anyway, uh, I sorta, kinda...

02:20.700 --> 02:22.668
- am having a beverage...
- Mm.

02:22.735 --> 02:24.836
- with someone that I work with...
- Mm.

02:24.904 --> 02:26.471
who is not a man.

02:26.539 --> 02:27.773
- Hence the jeans.
- Oh.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.442
Well, um...

02:30.510 --> 02:31.977
Okay. That's fine.

02:32.045 --> 02:33.478
Mm.

02:33.546 --> 02:34.780
Is this like when you said you were fine

02:34.847 --> 02:36.715
with me getting a motorcycle,
and then I came home

02:36.783 --> 02:38.850
and it had turned into a minivan?

02:38.918 --> 02:40.185
I don't think so.

02:40.253 --> 02:42.020
It's time for us to start moving on.

02:42.088 --> 02:44.957
Okay, well, that's... that's great.

02:45.024 --> 02:46.658
I'm really relieved.

02:46.726 --> 02:48.227
But just so you know,
I'm not making waffles

02:48.294 --> 02:50.028
for any visiting tramps
who don't eat carbs anyway.

02:50.096 --> 02:51.096
Fine.

02:51.164 --> 02:53.799
Um, and while we're making rules, um...

02:53.866 --> 02:55.746
Let's not date anybody
the other person knows.

02:55.802 --> 02:57.669
Also, we can't introduce
anyone to the kids

02:57.737 --> 02:59.471
until we tell each other about it first.

02:59.539 --> 03:00.405
Good idea.

03:00.473 --> 03:02.874
And, uh...

03:02.942 --> 03:04.042
One last thing.

03:04.110 --> 03:05.428
Hm.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.355
Ah. Mm-hmm.

03:07.357 --> 03:08.559
Yeah, I been wondering when we

03:08.584 --> 03:09.905
were gonna get around to this.

03:09.949 --> 03:11.984
I didn't want to be first, but it's time.

03:12.051 --> 03:13.485
Maybe we should do it together.

03:13.553 --> 03:15.354
- Okay.
- Yeah.

03:15.421 --> 03:17.522
- Really on there.
- Yeah.

03:17.590 --> 03:19.157
It's the heat, you know.

03:19.225 --> 03:21.696
- That under my wedding weight.
- Me too.

03:21.697 --> 03:22.543
Here, why don't

03:22.568 --> 03:23.519
- you, and I'll...
- Yeah.

03:23.563 --> 03:25.430
Okay. Good idea.

03:25.498 --> 03:26.717
If it had been this hard to get my

03:26.742 --> 03:27.890
pants off, we wouldn't be here.

Synced and corrected by VitoSilans

03:33.006 --> 03:34.873
Okay, so, Pat has a date,

03:34.941 --> 03:36.875
but I think before you get jealous,

03:36.943 --> 03:38.744
we should set up an
online profile for you.

03:38.811 --> 03:41.413
I've always wanted to
try Farmersmainly.com.

03:41.481 --> 03:43.115
Strong man with callused hands...

03:43.182 --> 03:44.249
Yes, please!

03:44.317 --> 03:46.018
I don't want what you want, Jodi.

03:46.085 --> 03:47.185
But we're so similar.

03:47.253 --> 03:48.587
This may surprise you,

03:48.655 --> 03:50.789
but I'm happy having my own space,

03:50.857 --> 03:53.792
my own time, my own callused hands.

03:53.860 --> 03:55.961
I installed that ceiling fan by myself...

03:56.029 --> 03:57.462
with Chinese instructions.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.398
But don't you yearn for human contact?

03:59.465 --> 04:00.823
I don't even want to be having this

04:00.827 --> 04:02.129
conversation with you right now.

04:03.269 --> 04:04.970
Mm.

04:06.039 --> 04:07.272
Hello.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.180
Hi, Mrs. O'Neal. This
is Vice Principal Murray.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.909
I'm calling about your daughter.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.611
Ohh, no. What did Shannon do now?

04:12.679 --> 04:13.812
Well, I think it'd be best

04:13.880 --> 04:15.814
for you to come and speak in person.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.382
The students are furious
school isn't over yet,

04:17.450 --> 04:19.050
and it's... it's not safe for me to leave

04:19.052 --> 04:20.218
until the sun goes down.

04:20.286 --> 04:21.987
Fine. I'll... I'll be right there.

04:23.122 --> 04:24.556
Jodi, I'm sorry. I've got to go.

04:24.624 --> 04:25.857
Okay, one question.

04:25.925 --> 04:27.993
Do you know how to or would
you be willing to learn

04:28.061 --> 04:28.960
how to use a tractor?

04:29.028 --> 04:30.929
I said no!

04:32.198 --> 04:33.899
This guy's part-time rodeo clown,

04:33.966 --> 04:35.801
full-time hottie.

04:35.868 --> 04:37.169
I know you're in there, Murray.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.770
Stay away from my car!

04:41.240 --> 04:42.274
Hello.

04:42.342 --> 04:44.743
Oh. Hi. Uh, Mrs. O'Neal.

04:44.811 --> 04:45.944
Come in.

04:46.012 --> 04:47.012
Are you okay?

04:47.080 --> 04:48.580
Okay? Am I okay?

04:48.648 --> 04:50.849
Well, the extra week of school
means I'm not on my biking tour

04:50.917 --> 04:52.918
through the wine country of Wisconsin,

04:52.985 --> 04:54.419
so that's not okay.

04:54.487 --> 04:57.322
I... Thought you called me
here to talk about Shannon.

04:57.390 --> 04:59.150
Yeah, Shannon... she
went on our prom website

04:59.192 --> 05:00.759
and bought up every single ticket,

05:00.827 --> 05:03.028
which she is now selling back
to the students at a huge markup.

05:03.096 --> 05:06.164
She also changed the
password to the website.

05:06.232 --> 05:07.466
Or else I've forgotten it.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.101
Either way, it's frustrating.

05:09.168 --> 05:12.037
Did you stipulate that
students were only allowed

05:12.105 --> 05:14.039
to buy a certain number
of tickets to the prom?

05:14.107 --> 05:15.540
I did not.

05:15.608 --> 05:17.042
Can you tell me, then,

05:17.110 --> 05:19.144
what Shannon is being punished for?

05:19.212 --> 05:20.946
I... cannot.

05:21.013 --> 05:22.314
Then what am I doing here?

05:22.382 --> 05:23.615
Because she's your child!

05:23.683 --> 05:25.851
And I'm supposed to be
meeting like-minded singles

05:25.918 --> 05:27.519
in the Tuscany of the midwest!

05:27.587 --> 05:29.321
No one calls Wisconsin that.

05:29.389 --> 05:32.057
Tell that to the
brochure from door county!

05:32.125 --> 05:33.792
I already cut the tags off my outfit.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.180
Where else am I gonna wear that?!

05:36.295 --> 05:38.730
What a relief to leave
the hot and stifling school

05:38.798 --> 05:40.632
and enter this hot and stifling house.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.033
Hey, guys, look at my chest.

05:42.101 --> 05:43.501
I'm sweating in the shape of Jesus.

05:43.536 --> 05:44.770
Uggh.

05:44.837 --> 05:47.406
I don't understand why we
have to study on Friday.

05:47.473 --> 05:49.841
We should do something
fun and study later...

05:49.909 --> 05:51.376
like.. on Sunday.

05:51.444 --> 05:54.413
- Oh. Jimmy...
- Or Monday, on the bus.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.415
Guys, there is no use in complaining.

05:56.482 --> 05:57.883
We are on lockdown.

05:57.950 --> 06:00.318
Mom has already started
making those gross Kale chips.

06:00.386 --> 06:01.457
Where is Mom?

06:01.539 --> 06:02.687
I don't know.

06:02.755 --> 06:03.755
There's Dad's wallet.

06:03.823 --> 06:06.358
Dad! Are you home?

06:06.426 --> 06:07.692
Dad?!

06:15.635 --> 06:18.837
He's not here, and his badge is.

06:18.905 --> 06:21.173
Why would Dad have left
this? He never leaves it.

06:22.241 --> 06:23.742
Oh, god. So late.

06:23.810 --> 06:26.111
Okay, come on. Quick,
quick, quick, quick, quick.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.848
Why am I sweating so much?

06:32.251 --> 06:35.053
Go on a date with chicken in my unders?

06:35.982 --> 06:37.055
No.

06:39.659 --> 06:42.060
And the minivan's gone, too.

06:42.128 --> 06:43.895
You know what this means?

06:43.963 --> 06:45.363
They've been murdered.

06:45.431 --> 06:48.033
Well... Probably not.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.468
But if they were,

06:49.535 --> 06:51.603
shouldn't we have some
fun before we find out?

06:51.671 --> 06:52.938
She's right.

06:53.005 --> 06:54.372
We can't waste this opportunity.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.209
Think of all the free stuff cops
get for flashing their badges.

06:57.276 --> 06:58.977
No! No way.

06:59.045 --> 07:01.146
Jimmy, impersonating a
cop is, like, a felony.

07:01.214 --> 07:01.980
Busted!

07:02.048 --> 07:05.317
You're under arrest for being an
old lady impersonating a teenage boy.

07:05.384 --> 07:08.119
What if Mom and Dad come home
and we're not here studying?

07:08.187 --> 07:09.888
They'll be so happy they're not murdered,

07:09.956 --> 07:10.980
they won't be mad at us.

07:11.163 --> 07:12.324
That brain food's working, Jimmy.

07:12.391 --> 07:13.091
Yep.

07:13.159 --> 07:14.259
No!

07:14.327 --> 07:15.994
We are not running around like tiny cops!

07:16.062 --> 07:18.396
Oh, come on, Kenny.

07:18.464 --> 07:19.564
I'm your brother,

07:19.632 --> 07:22.167
and it is my duty to get you on board.

07:22.235 --> 07:24.840
This is our key to the city.

07:24.965 --> 07:28.406
So just think as big as you can.

07:34.747 --> 07:37.849
We were young and beautiful,
and the city was ours.

07:37.917 --> 07:38.850
Bon appétit.

07:38.918 --> 07:40.986
We were living the high life,

07:41.053 --> 07:43.088
and nothing was gonna stop us.

07:45.157 --> 07:46.625
Aww.

07:50.096 --> 07:51.763
There you are. Enjoy.

07:52.832 --> 07:53.896
Welcome to Lenny's,

07:54.025 --> 07:57.168
home of the world-famous
lightly browned toast.

07:57.236 --> 07:59.104
Well, I imagined it a little differently,

07:59.171 --> 08:00.205
but... this works.

08:00.273 --> 08:02.774
Officer Patrick O'Neal.

08:02.842 --> 08:04.376
Cop... at your service.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.512
We're here to protect, serve...

08:07.580 --> 08:09.014
And eat free nachos.

08:09.081 --> 08:10.482
Nachos, nachos, nachos...

08:10.550 --> 08:12.284
All right, kids. Calm down.

08:16.022 --> 08:17.822
Have you been single long?

08:17.890 --> 08:19.858
Feels like so long.

08:19.926 --> 08:20.625
Yeah.

08:20.693 --> 08:22.527
Divorces are rough.

08:22.595 --> 08:23.695
Yeah.

08:23.763 --> 08:25.603
They're not as glamorous
as they make them seem

08:25.631 --> 08:27.032
in those Nancy Meyers movies.

08:28.023 --> 08:29.050
Last time I got a haircut,

08:29.052 --> 08:32.037
I kept leaning my face into
the girl's arm, like a cat.

08:32.104 --> 08:33.471
Ohh. Yeah.

08:33.539 --> 08:35.073
She may not cut your hair again.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.640
Yeah, that was the impression I got.

08:36.708 --> 08:38.076
Yeah.

08:38.144 --> 08:40.010
Well, I understand it, though.

08:40.078 --> 08:41.246
I do.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.631
And I don't usually admit this, but...

08:43.773 --> 08:45.967
Sometimes I think...

08:46.266 --> 08:49.821
It's nice to get a
little... human contact.

08:49.889 --> 08:50.555
Yeah.

09:05.271 --> 09:06.204
Oh!

09:06.272 --> 09:07.238
Uh...

09:07.306 --> 09:08.540
I'm gonna go call Shannon.

09:08.608 --> 09:09.841
Uh, that'd be good.

09:10.910 --> 09:11.576
O-kay.

09:12.757 --> 09:14.179
Hey, it's me!

09:14.286 --> 09:15.127
I left my laptop,

09:15.128 --> 09:17.619
and I want to see if any
hot farmers branded me.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.893
Oh. Eileen.

09:24.961 --> 09:26.862
You're in a shame ball. I know that shape.

09:26.930 --> 09:28.430
What happened?

09:28.498 --> 09:30.933
I did something...

09:31.000 --> 09:33.135
to my kids' vice principal.

09:33.203 --> 09:34.436
Oh, my god, Eileen. You killed him.

09:34.504 --> 09:37.106
No, I didn't kill him!

09:37.173 --> 09:38.273
I kissed him.

09:38.341 --> 09:40.309
Oh! That is so much more shocking.

09:40.377 --> 09:42.378
I know!

09:42.445 --> 09:43.912
And it was really good.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.948
- Yeah.
- But I'm not even attracted to him.

09:46.015 --> 09:47.916
Oh, god. Why did I do this?

09:47.984 --> 09:49.518
Is it because Pat went on a date?

09:50.453 --> 09:52.388
And you say I always
ask the dumb questions?

09:52.455 --> 09:53.722
Oh, god.

09:53.790 --> 09:54.923
This is terrible.

09:54.991 --> 09:57.926
He's responsible for
my children's education.

09:57.994 --> 10:01.130
I'm going to have to see him again.

10:02.365 --> 10:04.266
Could this affect their grades?

10:04.334 --> 10:07.136
Ugh! What have I done with my mouth?

10:07.203 --> 10:09.505
This is why farmers' lives are simpler...

10:09.572 --> 10:12.474
because they live, like, acres
and acres away from each other.

10:12.542 --> 10:13.942
I'm gonna have to talk to him

10:14.010 --> 10:15.490
and tell him this kiss was a mistake.

10:15.545 --> 10:18.313
My hands are still so
shaky from the shame.

10:18.381 --> 10:20.149
Come on. You're gonna have to drive me.

10:20.216 --> 10:21.417
Are you sweating?

10:21.484 --> 10:22.918
I've never seen you sweat.

10:22.986 --> 10:25.587
It started in Vice Principal
What's-his-name's office,

10:25.655 --> 10:27.122
and it hasn't stopped.

10:27.190 --> 10:29.458
It's only coming from my elbow pits.

10:29.526 --> 10:32.327
Well, your body's really
abandoned you today.

10:32.395 --> 10:33.429
No, I know.

10:33.496 --> 10:34.863
That's actually not true.

10:34.931 --> 10:35.931
Oh, really?

10:35.999 --> 10:36.799
Thanks.

10:36.866 --> 10:38.133
Here you go, sport.

10:38.201 --> 10:40.135
Um...

10:40.203 --> 10:43.472
I expected something
just a bit more manlier

10:43.540 --> 10:45.541
when I ordered the Miami Vice.

10:46.876 --> 10:49.812
Well, it's so tiny that
it makes you look bigger,

10:49.879 --> 10:50.946
so that's manly.

10:51.014 --> 10:52.815
Want to start a tab?

10:52.882 --> 10:53.949
Uh, yeah.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.520
Oh, my god. I forgot my wallet.

10:58.588 --> 11:00.489
It's 'cause I couldn't fit it

11:00.557 --> 11:02.124
in these stupid skinny jeans,

11:02.192 --> 11:04.192
and then I was sweating,
and I went in the freezer,

11:04.227 --> 11:06.628
and I was gonna put a frozen
chicken in my underpants and...

11:06.696 --> 11:08.530
my brain's telling me to keep going,

11:08.598 --> 11:10.365
but your face is telling me to stop.

11:10.433 --> 11:11.884
You should probably listen to my face.

11:11.909 --> 11:13.368
- Yep.
- I don't mind paying.

11:13.436 --> 11:14.837
How much?

11:14.904 --> 11:16.572
Yours is $5, and his is $16.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.146
And they said they couldn't
turn cheesecake into a shake.

11:24.214 --> 11:26.181
You know what... you
should put this on the menu

11:26.249 --> 11:27.382
and name it after me.

11:27.450 --> 11:28.650
Can I get you anything else?

11:28.718 --> 11:29.918
Actually, yes.

11:29.986 --> 11:32.421
I, uh, I believe we're ready for dessert.

11:32.489 --> 11:33.889
We'll have three of your favorites.

11:33.890 --> 11:36.058
Whatever the chef feels
is the most inspired today.

11:36.125 --> 11:38.660
Everything's pretty inspiring here.

11:38.728 --> 11:41.263
Also, you don't need to show
your badge every time you order.

11:41.331 --> 11:43.999
Oh. He's just very proud
of his chosen career.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.068
Well, listen. It's not about being proud.

11:46.135 --> 11:48.535
It's about getting out there
and trying to make a difference.

11:48.571 --> 11:49.931
- Mm.
- I mean, don't get me wrong.

11:49.973 --> 11:51.940
Am I proud of the badge?

11:52.008 --> 11:53.275
You bet your ass...

11:53.343 --> 11:54.910
Sorry. My French... uh, I am.

11:54.978 --> 11:56.912
But what I'm more proud of

11:56.980 --> 11:58.780
is how many criminals tell me every day,

11:58.848 --> 11:59.811
- Mnh-mnh.
- "we would be

11:59.836 --> 12:01.073
doing so much more crime

12:01.117 --> 12:02.357
- Mnh-mnh.
- if it weren't for you."

12:02.418 --> 12:03.218
- Shh!
- Mnh-mnh!

12:03.286 --> 12:04.453
That's really why we do it.

12:04.521 --> 12:06.455
Exactly.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.391
Oh, no.

12:10.593 --> 12:13.462
Please tell the chef
we'll be skipping dessert.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.697
And they thought today was
their last day of school,

12:15.765 --> 12:17.866
but it's not, with all these snow days,

12:17.934 --> 12:20.217
so it just became this whole kerfuffle.

12:20.396 --> 12:22.242
I love a man who says "kerfuffle"

12:22.375 --> 12:23.735
while holding a drink for a mouse.

12:24.954 --> 12:27.220
Why don't we do this... why
don't we just leave here?

12:27.221 --> 12:29.311
We'll go back to my place, get my wallet,

12:29.379 --> 12:31.647
and we'll go on a little
Pat-sponsored dinner.

12:31.714 --> 12:32.881
- That works.
- Yeah? Great.

12:35.985 --> 12:38.654
That's weird. It's a Chicago P.D. number.

12:38.721 --> 12:41.056
So sorry. Hang on.

12:41.124 --> 12:41.924
Hello?

12:41.991 --> 12:43.392
Hey, Pat, it's Golaski.

12:43.459 --> 12:45.794
I'm here at Lenny's with
your three beautiful children,

12:45.862 --> 12:48.463
who used your badge to get a
tremendous amount of free food.

12:48.531 --> 12:49.498
What?!

12:49.566 --> 12:50.799
Uh...

12:50.867 --> 12:51.800
Okay.

12:51.868 --> 12:53.235
Um, I'm so sorry about this.

12:53.303 --> 12:54.670
I-I'll be right down there.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.609
Well, my kids have decided

13:00.677 --> 13:03.011
to impersonate an officer
at Lenny's all-night diner.

13:03.079 --> 13:04.479
That's their big move?

13:04.547 --> 13:06.415
Why wouldn't they go buy booze?

13:06.482 --> 13:08.447
Well, my kids are a bunch of weirdos.

13:15.213 --> 13:17.626
Hey, Gloria. You work in the
crime-scene photo lab, right?

13:17.694 --> 13:18.660
Yeah.

13:18.728 --> 13:19.888
What's the most gruesome thing

13:19.896 --> 13:21.129
you've ever laid your eyes on?

13:21.197 --> 13:22.598
Don't answer that.

13:22.665 --> 13:24.833
And really, you can just pretend
like they're not even here.

13:24.901 --> 13:26.168
You are not meeting them.

13:26.235 --> 13:27.869
Are you ashamed of us?

13:27.937 --> 13:29.137
Tonight, yes.

13:29.205 --> 13:31.106
You guys are in a lot
of trouble, you know.

13:31.174 --> 13:32.641
Impersonating a cop is a felony.

13:32.709 --> 13:34.710
I s... I knew that. I
said that. I said that.

13:34.777 --> 13:36.612
And yet here you are.

13:36.679 --> 13:38.714
I'm not gonna punish
you in front of Gloria.

13:38.781 --> 13:40.349
In fact, as far as I'm concerned,

13:40.416 --> 13:41.536
you have never even met her.

13:41.584 --> 13:44.987
Dad, we get that you're on a date.

13:45.054 --> 13:45.854
Wait... what?

13:45.922 --> 13:47.689
Nobody should be talking!

13:49.292 --> 13:52.561
This actually is my first
date in 18 1/2 years.

13:52.629 --> 13:53.962
You don't say.

13:54.030 --> 13:54.730
Yeah.

13:54.797 --> 13:55.797
Listen, I'm so sorry.

13:55.865 --> 13:56.683
If it's okay with you,

13:56.685 --> 13:58.400
can I just go on and take you home now?

13:58.468 --> 13:59.835
We'll do dinner another night. I promise.

13:59.902 --> 14:01.870
But I just... I really feel
like I need to get inside

14:01.938 --> 14:03.666
and deal with these highly
unambitious criminals.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.473
Yeah, it's fine.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.042
Uh, but I don't think I can
make it all the way home.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.477
Can I, uh, run inside

14:08.544 --> 14:11.046
and use your restroom real quick?

14:11.114 --> 14:12.714
Ohhh...

14:12.782 --> 14:14.182
Well...

14:14.250 --> 14:16.551
See, I'm not really supposed
to have girls in the house.

14:16.619 --> 14:18.520
- Oh, dear.
- Oh! Rough.

14:18.588 --> 14:19.554
Seriously?

14:19.622 --> 14:20.656
Yeah, you're right. You're right.

14:20.723 --> 14:22.057
We can do that. We can do that.

14:22.125 --> 14:23.592
Just do it superduper quick.

14:23.660 --> 14:25.327
And maybe... Don't even wash your hands.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.199
Hi again.

14:31.267 --> 14:32.567
Oh. Hi. You're back.

14:32.635 --> 14:33.902
Uh... Come in.

14:33.970 --> 14:35.270
O... kay.

14:36.906 --> 14:38.540
So...

14:39.776 --> 14:42.377
Um, I just wanted to apologize.

14:42.445 --> 14:46.381
You see, my ex is going
on a date tonight...

14:46.449 --> 14:47.259
his first.

14:47.368 --> 14:50.531
So I think I was just feeling jealous,

14:50.684 --> 14:52.564
and... I acted out.

14:52.799 --> 14:55.123
Well... okay.

14:55.191 --> 14:56.358
I've certainly been there.

14:56.426 --> 14:58.283
But, then, why would I kiss you?

14:58.433 --> 15:00.529
Because you like me.

15:00.596 --> 15:01.963
Oh, no.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.065
No, that is definitely not it.

15:04.187 --> 15:04.923
Yeah.

15:04.924 --> 15:06.268
I think it is.

15:06.335 --> 15:08.637
No, I really... I really think it's not.

15:08.705 --> 15:09.734
What are you doing?

15:09.878 --> 15:11.390
What are you wearing?

15:28.791 --> 15:30.726
Oh!

15:33.192 --> 15:35.653
Is that Wisconsin rosé?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.633
From the Kickapoo terroir region.

15:38.701 --> 15:39.935
Mm. Yeah.

15:41.215 --> 15:44.106
Well, uh...

15:44.173 --> 15:45.307
Um...

15:45.374 --> 15:46.475
I got to go.

15:46.542 --> 15:47.776
Now.

15:52.248 --> 15:53.448
Eileen?

15:53.516 --> 15:54.349
Hello?

15:54.417 --> 15:55.617
Anybody home?

15:56.919 --> 15:58.653
Okay. Think we're clear.

15:58.721 --> 15:59.405
Let's move. Let's move!

15:59.406 --> 16:01.280
Love a date that feels like a drug bust.

16:01.292 --> 16:02.724
I'm so sorry about this.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.152
- Here we go... right here.
- Okay.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.927
Just make yourself at
home. Just real, real quick.

16:07.063 --> 16:08.419
Okay, Dad, I know we're in trouble,

16:08.420 --> 16:10.165
so I should keep this to myself,

16:10.233 --> 16:11.867
but you are not killing it.

16:11.934 --> 16:13.301
Yes, I know. Thank you.

16:13.369 --> 16:14.770
It's a total disaster.

16:14.837 --> 16:16.877
Everything was going great
till you guys got busted.

16:16.939 --> 16:18.340
Dad, be honest... is it serious?

16:18.407 --> 16:19.841
Is she moving into the basement?

16:19.909 --> 16:21.376
Have you guys done tongue stuff?

16:21.444 --> 16:23.378
What?! No.

16:23.446 --> 16:25.614
Oh, man. I've broken so many rules.

16:25.681 --> 16:27.019
You weren't supposed to meet a woman yet,

16:27.020 --> 16:28.717
especially one that I barely even know,

16:28.785 --> 16:30.786
that's not supposed to be in this house.

16:30.853 --> 16:33.188
I'm a bad divorcer and a bad parent.

16:33.256 --> 16:35.690
And a bad date. Don't forget "bad date."

16:35.758 --> 16:37.359
Dad, relax, okay?

16:37.426 --> 16:39.828
You're not a bad parent.
We're okay with this.

16:39.896 --> 16:41.336
Mom and Gloria, probably not so much,

16:41.364 --> 16:43.198
and, honestly... Maybe not Jimmy.

16:43.266 --> 16:44.800
But Shannon and I are fine.

16:44.867 --> 16:45.901
Okay, look.

16:45.968 --> 16:47.335
She can have you for Thanksgiving,

16:47.403 --> 16:49.838
but Christmas... I'm your number-one elf.

16:49.906 --> 16:50.839
Look, we'll talk about
all this stuff later!

16:50.907 --> 16:52.274
Right now, I've got to get Gloria

16:52.341 --> 16:54.309
out of your mother's bathroom
as quickly as possible.

16:54.377 --> 16:55.744
Gloria?

16:55.812 --> 16:57.479
How's it going in there? Is
everything coming out okay?

16:57.547 --> 16:58.747
Ha ha.

16:58.815 --> 17:00.816
I was just washing my
hands. I'm coming out.

17:00.883 --> 17:02.384
I asked you not to wash
your hands, but okay.

17:02.451 --> 17:04.019
So... Um...

17:04.086 --> 17:05.820
Of course the... the door's stuck.

17:07.824 --> 17:09.824
Door's been sticking, and
I was supposed to fix it.

17:10.992 --> 17:12.694
He may be bad at fixing things,

17:12.762 --> 17:14.695
but he cooks French toast like an angel!

17:14.763 --> 17:16.765
Believe me, I won't be here for breakfast.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.602
Oh, no.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.436
Uh, you might be.

17:23.304 --> 17:24.550
Come on!

17:24.700 --> 17:27.026
Kenny, hand me the Phillips head, please.

17:27.094 --> 17:28.761
Oh, father.

17:28.829 --> 17:31.898
Do we really need to add my lack
of tool knowledge to this day?

17:31.965 --> 17:33.900
- Come on!
- So, you're the gay one.

17:33.967 --> 17:37.070
I think coming out in high
school is really brave.

17:37.137 --> 17:39.405
Thank you, Gloria!

17:39.473 --> 17:40.740
I hope the fact that
you're bonding with my kids

17:40.808 --> 17:41.874
that you weren't supposed to meet

17:41.942 --> 17:43.422
means there's hope for a second date.

17:43.477 --> 17:45.244
There won't be a second date.

17:45.312 --> 17:46.946
Oh. Really?

17:47.014 --> 17:48.915
Everybody stand back!

17:48.982 --> 17:50.950
Oh. Hang on.

17:51.018 --> 17:52.485
Oy-ah!

17:52.553 --> 17:53.453
Okay.

17:53.520 --> 17:54.987
Hahh!

17:57.858 --> 18:00.226
Wow. That was so badass.

18:00.294 --> 18:02.128
You don't need a man to
succeed in life, Shannon.

18:02.196 --> 18:03.896
I didn't think anything
could emasculate me more

18:03.964 --> 18:06.733
than that tiny pink
drink, but... You just did.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.101
I'm sorry, Pat.

18:08.168 --> 18:09.348
You're cute,

18:09.349 --> 18:11.309
but I can't really deal
with your whole situation.

18:11.371 --> 18:13.639
Oh, I understand. I can't
deal with it, either.

18:13.707 --> 18:15.742
I'm taking you home.

18:17.211 --> 18:19.679
Well, Dad has now dipped his toe

18:19.747 --> 18:22.615
into the murky waters of the dating pool.

18:22.683 --> 18:24.183
I guess Mom's next.

18:24.251 --> 18:26.119
I don't want either
of them to go swimming.

18:26.186 --> 18:29.255
It's just weird to
think of them moving on.

18:29.323 --> 18:33.493
Also, I found Gloria to
be a little attractive.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.827
So that was confusing.

18:34.895 --> 18:36.696
I liked her. She was hardcore.

18:36.764 --> 18:39.365
I feel like I could use her
on my six if things went dark.

18:39.433 --> 18:40.499
What?

18:40.637 --> 18:43.002
Jimmy, I don't think you have
anything to worry about right away.

18:43.070 --> 18:45.638
Dad locked his first date
in the bathroom, so...

18:45.706 --> 18:47.473
And Mom doesn't really like people.

18:47.541 --> 18:49.375
If they're ever gonna
hook up successfully,

18:49.443 --> 18:50.777
they'll probably need our help.

18:52.246 --> 18:54.280
Mom! 'Sup?

18:54.348 --> 18:56.682
Uh, uh... We're just actually
taking a break from studying

18:56.750 --> 18:57.817
to talk about...

18:57.885 --> 18:58.885
Uh, math.

18:58.952 --> 18:59.886
Save it, Jimmy.

18:59.953 --> 19:01.120
I know you haven't been studying

19:01.188 --> 19:03.122
because you don't have
pen all over your face.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.191
And you have a part in your hair.

19:05.259 --> 19:06.492
Anyway...

19:06.560 --> 19:09.228
Shannon, you're grounded
for scalping prom tickets.

19:09.296 --> 19:10.296
I'm being punished

19:10.364 --> 19:12.064
because I have an entrepreneurial spirit?

19:12.132 --> 19:13.065
Yes.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.168
But you can thank me.

19:15.235 --> 19:17.703
I made a deal with Clive, so
you won't be in trouble at school

19:17.771 --> 19:19.071
if you return the tickets

19:19.139 --> 19:21.099
and then donate the profits
to the prom committee.

19:21.108 --> 19:22.542
I'm sorry... who is Clive?

19:22.609 --> 19:23.976
Oh, um...

19:24.044 --> 19:25.912
I meant, uh, Vice Principal Murray.

19:25.979 --> 19:28.181
I know his name... 'cause I'm friendly.

19:28.248 --> 19:30.550
Yeah, I'm a people person.

19:30.617 --> 19:33.052
Um, the postman's name is Ralph.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.687
The postman's name is Janet.

19:34.755 --> 19:37.690
Well, my nickname for her
is Ralph, and she gets it.

19:37.758 --> 19:39.692
So... Get back to your studying.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.260
See?

19:41.328 --> 19:43.196
Ain't nobody gonna date that.

19:43.263 --> 19:44.730
She cray.

19:47.501 --> 19:49.569
Ahh.

19:49.636 --> 19:50.369
Hey.

19:50.437 --> 19:51.437
Want some?

19:52.639 --> 19:53.739
Sure.

19:53.807 --> 19:55.408
I never turn down a pink drink.

19:57.477 --> 19:58.644
Thanks.

20:01.415 --> 20:02.715
Well...

20:02.783 --> 20:04.517
We said we were gonna tell each other

20:04.585 --> 20:05.818
about our dating lives, so...

20:05.886 --> 20:09.622
I... think we spoke too
soon about those rules.

20:09.690 --> 20:11.524
Maybe it is better if
we don't tell each other

20:11.592 --> 20:13.459
everything about our
dating lives after all.

20:13.527 --> 20:14.694
Ohhh. Really?

20:14.761 --> 20:16.229
- Yes.
- Phew.

20:16.296 --> 20:18.197
I get the feeling no
matter how hard we try

20:18.265 --> 20:19.765
to keep things nice and neat,

20:19.833 --> 20:21.767
dating is gonna get... messy.

20:21.835 --> 20:23.436
Oh.

20:23.503 --> 20:25.605
It's gonna be a disaster.

20:25.672 --> 20:26.706
Cheers.

20:26.773 --> 20:28.074
Cheers.

20:31.879 --> 20:33.546
Mmm! Wisconsin?

20:33.614 --> 20:34.614
Kickapoo.

20:34.681 --> 20:35.615
Nice!

20:35.682 --> 20:37.316
Mm.

20:38.785 --> 20:41.621
Who knocked down the bathroom door?

20:41.688 --> 20:43.322
Huh.

20:43.390 --> 20:45.057
Must have been the heat.

20:48.361 --> 20:50.729
Looks like he woke up on
the wrong side of the bed.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.588
The dead side.

20:53.656 --> 20:54.589
Bom-bom!

20:55.324 --> 20:57.192
Murdered by chickens.

20:58.361 --> 21:00.262
Un-clucking-believable.

21:00.329 --> 21:01.563
Bom-bom!

21:01.631 --> 21:03.331
What in the world are you doing?

21:03.399 --> 21:04.030
I was...

21:04.031 --> 21:05.871
Can't believe after
everything that's happened,

21:05.902 --> 21:07.382
you haven't even learned your lesson.

21:07.403 --> 21:08.403
Give me those sunglasses.

21:08.471 --> 21:09.971
I'm sorry, Dad.

21:11.207 --> 21:12.941
Goes like this.

21:15.244 --> 21:18.146
Looks like he was murdered...

21:18.214 --> 21:19.414
To death.

21:19.482 --> 21:20.148
Bom-bom.
