00:02.300 --> 00:04.900
- ???
- ??

00:05.000 --> 00:07.700
You know...??

00:07.800 --> 00:08.800
because of death.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.400
- George Juergens?
- The one and only.

00:11.900 --> 00:13.400
You've been served.

00:13.600 --> 00:16.800
Incomplete? Like, I have to do some more
work before I can get my report card?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.600
More like incomplete, so you're
gonna have to go to summer school.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.600
You've been accepted into the Young
Healer's Summer Training Program.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.100
Oh. My dad.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.300
I remember him mentioning
something about it.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.900
My parents are kind of
getting back together.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.400
- So forget about my mom.
- All right.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.600
And sell us your house.

00:30.700 --> 00:32.100
Pack your bags.
We leave in one hour.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.300
We're just gonna take off and
leave Amy and John behind?

00:34.400 --> 00:36.400
Who knows if we'll be gone
three days or three weeks?

00:36.500 --> 00:38.600
We are not gonna be
 gone for three months.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.900
I have something
I need to tell you.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.300
- I'm marrying David.
- But you might change
your mind when you hear--

00:42.400 --> 00:46.000
I'm marrying David!
Just sign the papers, George.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.800
Oh, I see how it is.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
Ben, no.

00:49.100 --> 00:52.600
Listen, I better get going.
I got a plane to catch.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.200
Ben!

00:56.300 --> 00:58.100
Have a good summer.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.700
H & A I'm home. Where are you?

01:27.800 --> 01:29.900
Sending Message

01:47.100 --> 01:49.600
That's good, right there.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.800
Fine. Don't text me back.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.100
Dad.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.900
Set, hike!

02:41.700 --> 02:43.900
- Jack!
- Sorry, Mom.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.800
Tom. Tom, that is
so bad for you.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.700
Do you know how many calories
are in that sundae?

02:55.800 --> 03:00.000
No, but I have a feeling
I'm about to find out.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.600
About 1,700.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.000
Make it an even 2,000.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.900
I didn't eat
ice cream all summer.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.500
It wasn't allowed at med camp.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.300
Only heart-healthy foods, because
heart disease is the number one killer.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.500
Not in this family.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.200
Lighten up, Doc.
Your bedside manner stinks.

03:38.800 --> 03:39.500
Hi, Ricky.

03:39.600 --> 03:40.900
I just wanted to
say good night.

03:41.000 --> 03:44.200
- Just get back from Amy's?
- Yeah. We had trouble getting John to sleep.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.600
Gotta go. I'm exhausted.
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.300
Did you want to
come over before school?

03:48.400 --> 03:49.800
Yeah. Why not?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.500
See you then.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.000
You sure I have to go?

03:55.100 --> 03:57.000
Yes. You have to go.

03:59.200 --> 04:01.200
But I thought Ruben
wasn't staying here tonight.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.400
Mmm, you never know
when he might show up.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.700
Good night, Adrian.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.400
Night.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.800
Okay, I have to
be home in one hour.

04:22.600 --> 04:26.600
I told my parents I was getting a pack of
college-ruled notebook paper and pens.

04:29.300 --> 04:33.300
I've got paper and pens,
so we can take the whole hour.

04:49.200 --> 04:53.200

05:04.500 --> 05:07.100
So, first day of school.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.500
Yep.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.100
- And Ashley's first day of school.
- Yep.

05:11.200 --> 05:14.100
I hope you're not gonna let you being angry
with Ben get in the way of you reaching out

05:14.200 --> 05:16.400
to your sister on her
very first day of high school.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.500
On my first day of high school,
I was pregnant, and I got through it.

05:19.600 --> 05:20.800
I'm sure she'll get through it.

05:20.900 --> 05:23.300
I'm sure she will, because she'll
have her big sister helping her out.

05:23.400 --> 05:25.200
Mom, she's not gonna
need my help.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.200
Amy, as much as she doesn't
want to admit it,

05:27.300 --> 05:30.600
I think that Ashley is slightly
more insecure than she pretends to be.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.100
So you take care of her,
and forget about Ben for today.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.100
How am I supposed to do that?

05:34.200 --> 05:37.100
How am I supposed to forget
that he hasn't called me in two weeks?

05:37.200 --> 05:39.200
He didn't even call me
last night when he got in.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.000
Well, I'm sure that
there's a reason.

05:41.100 --> 05:44.900
You know, he was
probably just...busy.

05:45.000 --> 05:45.900
Yeah.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
He's probably too busy to 
even break up with me.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.000
I know that you're having
a hard time with Ben,

05:50.100 --> 05:53.500
but I don't want you to
make Ashley anxious about school.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.500
You and Ben will
work things out.

05:55.600 --> 05:57.800
You've been saying
that all summer.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.800
- Good morning, Amy.
- It's not a good morning.

06:04.700 --> 06:07.400
- How are you feeling?
- I'm okay.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.700
Feel like going up
to the house?

06:08.800 --> 06:11.800
Oh, let's skip it for today.
We're almost finished.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.500
Yep. Just a few more things
on the punch list, and then--

06:15.600 --> 06:17.100
Then we'll decide
when we're moving.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.800
Before the baby comes, right?

06:18.900 --> 06:21.300
Well, there's still a lot
of decisions we gotta make.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.700
- Yeah.
- I'm going to drive
Amy to drop off John,

06:23.800 --> 06:27.200
and then I'm gonna drive Amy and Ashley 
to Ashley's first day of high school.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.400
- George doesn't wanna do that?
- I always drive them on their first day.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.500
I want to make sure
that Ashley's okay.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.300
It's a big day for her.
It's high school.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.700
I love you.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.300
You, too.

06:42.700 --> 06:43.900
Don't come home
pregnant today, okay?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.200
No Amy repeats. And do as
your mom says, not as she does.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.000
Don't worry. I'm not pregnant,
and I don't plan on getting pregnant.

06:50.100 --> 06:54.100
Evidently there are no genes for planning
a pregnancy in this family, so watch out.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.600
- You nervous?
- About?

06:56.700 --> 06:59.300
I don't know. Making new friends.
Finding your way around.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.300
Oh, I got my schedule and my map online,
so I think I'll be able to find my way around.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.900
- What about the friends part?
- What about it?

07:06.000 --> 07:08.400
You're going to high school for the next
four years. You might wanna make a friend.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.000
- No pressure, okay?
- Okay.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.100
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yep, this is what I'm wearing.

07:14.200 --> 07:15.900
I just wanna be comfortable.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.700
You look comfortable.
I like it. It's a good look.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.900
It's not really a look.
It's just what happened.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.700
Most girls your age are going
to a lot of trouble to come up

07:21.800 --> 07:24.000
with some outfit or something special
for the first day of school.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.800
I'm not like most girls, Dad.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.000
Okay. Whatever you want, pumpkin.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.900
I'm fine with it
if you're fine with it.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.400
I am.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.700
So, excited about
your first day of school?

07:34.800 --> 07:36.200
Good to be back?

07:36.300 --> 07:37.400
No.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.100
I loved school.

07:39.300 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, I loved school, too,
and then I got pregnant at 15,

07:42.100 --> 07:45.600
had a baby, and now it's not
as much fun as it used to be.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.500
We're getting married, you know.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.800
Your mother and I.
We're having a baby.

07:50.900 --> 07:53.100
- Whatever.
- I'm gonna be around for a while,

07:53.200 --> 07:55.700
so we should work
on being friends.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.100
You know, I thought, uh,
with your dad and sister

07:59.200 --> 08:01.300
riding around the country
this summer and with Ben away,

08:01.400 --> 08:03.600
that you and I would get
a chance to know each other.

08:03.700 --> 08:07.400
But I just never seemed to be
able to get your attention all summer.

08:07.500 --> 08:08.800
- I was busy.
- I know.

08:08.900 --> 08:12.900
I still-- I still hold out hope
that we could be friends.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.800
- I have friends.
- It's just that, well,

08:15.900 --> 08:20.600
I feel a little funny about giving
you a car if we're not even friends.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.100
You did complete
driver's ed this summer?

08:24.200 --> 08:27.800
Yeah, but you can't
buy me a car.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.300
No, I can.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.900
What is this,
some kind of a bribe?

08:32.000 --> 08:37.600
If that's the way you want to look at
a brand-spanking-new SUV with leather interior,

08:38.000 --> 08:39.200
then I guess it is.

08:39.299 --> 08:42.200
David, I can't-- Where is it?

08:42.299 --> 08:44.400
- It'll be here this afternoon.
- Does my mom know?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.100
Your mother does.
Your father doesn't.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.400
But I think it'll be fine.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.900
But I won't have my license
for three more months.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.400
I think it's best
if you practice driving in the car

08:52.500 --> 08:54.400
you're going to be driving
for the test, don't you?

08:54.500 --> 08:56.000
Wow.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.400
Uh, I don't know
what else to say.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.400
How about, "I'll try a little
harder to get to know you, David."

09:01.500 --> 09:04.100
- I will. I promise.
- Well, have a nice day.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.400
Should I walk over and tell
your sister to have a nice day?

09:06.500 --> 09:09.400
Not unless you have another car.
No, I wouldn't.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.200
I think your mom's right about
Ashley being a little anxious.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.800
Tell Mom not to worry.
I'll take care of Ashley.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.900
And I won't even be
thinking about Ben.

09:18.100 --> 09:21.400
I managed to forget about him
this entire conversation.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.300
An SUV?

09:32.700 --> 09:33.400
Ben!

09:33.500 --> 09:36.700
Uhh! I can't.
I can't do it.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.800
My head's spinning.
I'm in a fog.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.800
I'm tired, Dad. I'm so tired.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.500
Can I please just
go to school tomorrow?

09:42.600 --> 09:45.200
You wanted to stay the extra week,
you got the extra week.

09:45.300 --> 09:47.500
All right? I told you it was going
to be like this when you came back,

09:47.600 --> 09:49.100
but you wanted to stay
till the last minute.

09:49.200 --> 09:51.600
So, let's go. Come on. Get up.

09:51.700 --> 09:53.400
- Do I have to?
- Yes, you have to.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.000
You can't miss
the first day of school.

09:59.100 --> 10:02.500
It's like I left my head
at the airport in Rome.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.900
You'll be all right.
You need to eat breakfast.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.900
If you eat on time--
breakfast, lunch and dinner--

10:07.000 --> 10:09.200
it'll help you get over
your jetlag faster.

10:09.300 --> 10:11.200
And try to get out in the sun
every chance you get today.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.100
- That helps, too.
- All right.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.700
So, uh, did you call Amy?

10:15.800 --> 10:18.700
No, I, uh-- I didn't
wanna wake up John.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.300
You didn't want
to wake up John.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.200
- I see.
- What? I didn't.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.700
When's the last time
you talked to her?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.200
A few days ago.

10:25.500 --> 10:29.100
Well, I was all over Italy
the last two weeks.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.700
You know? My phone
wasn't working.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.900
I left my battery charger somewhere between
Positano and Lake Pusiano, and I just--

10:35.000 --> 10:36.700
Yeah, and you just what?

10:36.800 --> 10:39.200
I just wanted a week
without calling her.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.800
I called her every day all summer.

10:40.900 --> 10:44.300
I spent most of my paycheck fighting
with her on international phone calls,

10:44.400 --> 10:49.100
and I realized that, you know,
I was coming back and I never got away.

10:49.200 --> 10:52.000
So, I just didn't call her.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.100
I still love her.

10:54.300 --> 10:58.700
I can't wait to get whatever argument
we're gonna have about this over with.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.600
I do. I love her.

11:01.700 --> 11:03.700
Not enough to buy
a phone charger?

11:05.100 --> 11:07.900
Dad, even you used to
take vacations from Mom and me.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.300
- You remember?
- Yeah, I remember.

11:10.400 --> 11:14.400
We missed you, but we had
a good time, the two of us.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.000
I know.

11:17.600 --> 11:22.700
Dad, did you and Mom ever have
to work at having a relationship?

11:22.800 --> 11:25.900
When I was in Italy, I didn't see
anybody working at their relationship.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.400
I saw couples on their
first vacation together.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.600
I saw newlyweds
on their honeymoon.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.700
I saw people who'd been
together for 50 years.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.600
Nobody seemed to be
working at their relationship.

11:36.700 --> 11:40.700
They just seemed to be
happy and in love and...

11:41.600 --> 11:43.300
That's what I want.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.400
I'm 16.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.500
And while I was working the whole summer,
cleaning tables and washing dishes,

11:48.600 --> 11:52.000
I was also working on
having a relationship with Amy.

11:52.800 --> 11:55.200
I don't think a relationship
should be work.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.400
It should just-- should happen.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.500
I agree.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.600
The experts, however,
would disagree.

12:00.700 --> 12:02.900
I don't care about the experts.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.600
Either Amy and I are
just happy being together,

12:06.700 --> 12:09.300
and we don't have to discuss
how to be happy being together

12:09.400 --> 12:11.900
every time we're
around each other, or...

12:12.000 --> 12:13.400
Or?

12:16.600 --> 12:17.900
Good morning.

12:19.700 --> 12:22.000
Oh. You look...comfortable.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.800
I am. Are we ready to go?

12:23.900 --> 12:26.800
Is that what you're wearing to
your first day of high school?

12:26.900 --> 12:29.700
- Yeah.
- Because?

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
Because I feel like it.

12:30.900 --> 12:34.200
It's just that, uh,

12:34.800 --> 12:36.700
I don't want you
to feel out of place.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.400
Yeah, Amy doesn't want
you to feel out of place.

12:38.500 --> 12:40.500
I'm not gonna feel out of place.
It's just high school.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.300
"Just"? "Just high school"?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.400
No. There is no
"just high school."

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
There is if you don't
make it important.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.100
And I'm not gonna make it important.
It's not important.

12:50.200 --> 12:55.300
It's just a legal requirement that I'm obligated
to participate in for the next four years,

12:55.400 --> 12:58.100
unless or until I do
pass the GED and opt out.

12:58.200 --> 13:00.000
Well, all right.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.600
Then, uh, let's just go.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.900
We have time.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
- For?
- For her to change.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.100
I'm not changing.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.000
- You can if you want.
- I don't want.

13:08.100 --> 13:11.400
First impressions are
very important, Ashley. Go change.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.900
Is that, uh, baby
puke on your shirt?

13:15.900 --> 13:16.600
No.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.200
I thought it was.
Can we go now?

13:18.300 --> 13:21.500
Yeah. Um, Amy, why don't you get
John? And then we'll just go.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.900
Yeah. I'll grab John.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.600
And you talk to her. She can't
go to school like that.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.000
You really do look... comfortable.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.200
You said that already.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.600
Yeah, I did. Because you do.

13:38.700 --> 13:41.400
- This is what I'm wearing.
- Okay.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.500
- What?
- I just can't believe it's
your first day of high school.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.000
It seems like yesterday I was
taking you to kindergarten.

13:48.100 --> 13:51.200
Well, soon you'll have another
daughter to take off to kindergarten.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.900
Oh, we don't know if it's a girl.
We didn't want to know.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.700
Yeah, we know we didn't want to know.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.800
We just wanted to change the subject
about what we are wearing to school.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.900
You can wear anything you want.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.100
It's just that you usually
look a little bit nicer.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.600
You have a lot of
clothes to choose from.

14:05.700 --> 14:08.100
- Why'd you choose that?
- Didn't really think about it.

14:08.200 --> 14:09.700
- Really?
- Really.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.100
Well, think about it.
Maybe you'll want to change.

14:12.200 --> 14:16.200
And hurry up. We have to go
and get this day over with and get my SUV.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.000
Didn't David tell you?
He's buying me a car.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.700
What are you talking about?

14:22.800 --> 14:25.700
I'm talking about the brand-new SUV
I'll be coming home to

14:25.900 --> 14:30.300
after what promises to be...??

14:39.100 --> 14:41.200
What, are you going somewhere?

14:41.300 --> 14:43.800
- First day of school.
- Are you sleeping over?

14:43.900 --> 14:46.000
Do you know how many back injuries
there are from heavy backpacks?

14:46.100 --> 14:48.000
Don't you have a locker?

14:48.100 --> 14:50.000
I don't always get
a chance to go to my locker.

14:50.100 --> 14:53.100
We used these at med camp.
They're great.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.000
It was a life-changing experience.

14:56.100 --> 14:57.800
- For all of us.
- How so?

14:57.900 --> 15:02.200
Now we can't stand
talking to you.

15:02.300 --> 15:05.000
Before this,
you were a normal person.

15:05.100 --> 15:09.600
Now you're a normal person
who thinks she is a doctor.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.000
You're in high school.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.900
I know, Tom.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.400
That'll be Jack.
He's taking me to school.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.500
Oh. You're still here.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.300
I'm still here.
Come on in, Tammy.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.200
What?

15:32.300 --> 15:34.900
I hate the way you talk to me.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.500
Really, Tammy? How's that?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.500
Get your hand off me!

15:39.600 --> 15:43.000
Why do you touch everyone
and go "what" in their face?

15:43.100 --> 15:45.700
Tammy don't want
you to touch her.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.400
Or get in my face.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.900
That's what instills
confidence in the patient.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.900
A doctor has to instill confidence
within the first 15 seconds of meeting them.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.300
So it helps to call
them by their name,

15:55.400 --> 15:57.000
put your hand on them,
and look them right in the eye.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.000
- You're not a doctor.
- Yeah, you're not a doctor.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.200
But I'm gonna be a doctor.

16:01.300 --> 16:06.200
Dad never touch anyone and
look in the face like that.

16:06.300 --> 16:10.500
I bet he did. You just never noticed it
'cause he did it so often, you never noticed it.

16:10.700 --> 16:11.600
I'm still practicing.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.600
Don't practice on us, okay?

16:13.700 --> 16:16.200
Yeah. Wait until
you get a license.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.800
Everything, really, you know.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.500
Shouldn't you be at school?

16:20.600 --> 16:23.900
How are you going to be a doctor
if you don't go to school?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.300
I'm going to school.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.400
I'm going to school, and the two
of you can have the house to yourself.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.100
Wait a minute, Tom.
Did Mom say it was okay

16:31.200 --> 16:32.900
for you to have company over
while she's at the dentist?

16:33.000 --> 16:36.100
For me to know and
you to find out.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.500
And when you find out,
it'll be too late.

16:39.700 --> 16:40.700
Bye.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.400
Have a good day at school. Bye.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.600
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.100
I missed you so much this summer.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.000
I missed you too, Grace.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.200
How are you, Jack?

17:01.300 --> 17:03.800
I'm okay, unless
you tell me otherwise.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.099
- You look great.
- You do, too.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.400
Why are you touching
my arm like that?

17:09.700 --> 17:11.700
And why are you looking
at me like that?

17:11.800 --> 17:15.000
I'm instilling confidence
in you as my patient.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.000
Or I'm just practicing.
Just something that doctors do.

17:19.099 --> 17:21.000
- Oh.
- It's something we learned this summer.

17:21.099 --> 17:22.900
I learned the cross buck pass.

17:23.000 --> 17:27.099
I learned that 47% of high school
football players suffer from groin injuries.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.800
So make sure you
wear a cup this season.

17:28.900 --> 17:30.500
Geez, Grace,
that's kind of personal.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.200
It's not personal,
it's medical. It's science.

17:33.300 --> 17:36.700
I just don't like hearing
you say something like "cup."

17:36.800 --> 17:39.200
Jack, I focused on
sports medicine at camp.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.100
Yeah, you told me. A few times.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.800
I just find it so interesting.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.900
- Mm-hmm. You ready to go?
- Yeah.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.900
What's that?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.900
That is the way I'll be avoiding
permanent back injury during the school year.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.300
- Grace, I'll carry your books for you.
- No need.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.300
It's just that I'd look like...

18:00.400 --> 18:04.500
Well, I don't want to roll
a pink book bag around school.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.100
You don't have to. I'll do it.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.100
All right. But I don't mind
carrying your books.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.700
Well, I don't mind
rolling my own books.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.500
- So, you ready?
- Yes. I can't wait for this year.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.200
- Me, too.
- Oh, did I tell you that
Jason and Madison broke up?

18:16.300 --> 18:18.900
- Jason who?
- Jack, Jason.

18:19.000 --> 18:23.100
Jason Treacy, Lauren's brother,
who I was at med camp with.

18:23.200 --> 18:26.600
Jason was dating Madison.
Lauren and Madison are best friends.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.300
Lauren and Madison are
Amy's best friends.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.000
- Oh.
- Anyway, when he got
back from med camp,

18:31.100 --> 18:34.500
he just felt like she was too...
casual about her future.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.400
- She's a sophomore.
- Exactly.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.500
I mean, she's got three years,
and then what?

18:38.600 --> 18:39.800
What college? What career?

18:39.900 --> 18:42.400
I'm a junior, and I don't even
know the answer to those questions.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.800
I'm glad you brought that up.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.500
I hope you're going to be
figuring that out this year,

18:45.600 --> 18:47.700
'cause next fall, you'll have to
start applying for colleges.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.500
True.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.700
And then after college,
I'm hoping we can get married.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.800
Before I go to med school.
So, no groin injuries.

19:02.800 --> 19:04.700
Where's Dr. Grace Bowman?

19:04.800 --> 19:07.000
She's on her way to the car.
I'll see you later, Tom.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.700
- Wait.
- What?

19:08.800 --> 19:11.000
Do you got a condom on you?

19:11.100 --> 19:12.700
For what?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.600
A water balloon.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.500
- No.
- Are you sure?

19:16.600 --> 19:17.700
 I'm sure.

19:17.800 --> 19:18.800
Really?

19:18.900 --> 19:21.700
All right. I have a condom,
but I'm not gonna give it to you.

19:21.900 --> 19:24.800
Unless you and Tammy
are... You're not...

19:25.000 --> 19:26.900
And if you are,
you should have your own.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
??...

19:28.100 --> 19:32.800
I...???...still
thinking about it.

19:32.900 --> 19:33.600
No...??

19:33.700 --> 19:34.400
You u are.

19:34.500 --> 19:38.200
That was a trick question...???

19:38.400 --> 19:39.700
Bye.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.400
Told you.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.300
Better not kill Mom.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.400
That's all I'm saying.

19:51.700 --> 19:55.600
- Thanks, Adrian.
- No. Thank you.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.100
Mmm. I love the back-to-school schedule.

20:00.200 --> 20:03.400
Can you come over here every morning
after Ruben leaves for work?

20:03.500 --> 20:04.800
I'll try.

20:04.900 --> 20:06.000
Will you?

20:06.100 --> 20:08.800
Why do we have to turn
something fun into a commitment?

20:08.900 --> 20:11.500
It was fun.
Let's just leave it at that.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.100
The whole summer was fun.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.500
I don't know what I like more--
working at the butcher shop

20:16.600 --> 20:18.900
or having sex with you
over the butcher shop.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.900
Oh, please tell me
you like me best.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.700
All right. I like you best.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.600
- Do you love me?
- Adrian.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.500
- Just say you love me.
- Why?

20:27.600 --> 20:31.800
Because Ben came back from Italy last night,
and he's thinking about breaking up with Amy.

20:31.900 --> 20:34.500
And I don't want Amy running to
you when he breaks up with her.

20:34.600 --> 20:35.900
How do you know
what Ben's thinking?

20:36.000 --> 20:37.400
I know, 'cause I
talked to him last night.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.000
Have you been talking
to him all summer?

20:39.100 --> 20:41.700
Um, I talked to him
a few times this summer.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.000
You didn't tell me that.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.700
I don't tell you everything.
You don't tell me everything.

20:45.800 --> 20:48.000
I don't want you and Ben to
be friends. I told you that.

20:48.100 --> 20:51.100
- You and Amy are friends.
- Amy and I have a son together.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.600
Yeah, and I'm your girlfriend,
and Ben's Amy's boyfriend,

20:53.700 --> 20:57.200
and when you and Amy are together,
Ben and I talk...sometimes.

20:57.300 --> 20:59.500
I told you, I don't want you
sleeping with anyone else.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.400
I thought we had
an understanding about that.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.500
I'm not having sex with Ben!

21:03.600 --> 21:05.600
- You're talking with Ben.
- So?

21:05.700 --> 21:07.400
So talking leads to sex.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.600
Everyone talks!

21:08.700 --> 21:10.900
- Everyone has sex.
- Not Ben!

21:11.000 --> 21:12.800
He didn't have sex this summer?

21:12.900 --> 21:14.400
I thought that's
what he went over there for.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.400
- He went over there for a summer job.
- And sex.

21:17.500 --> 21:18.800
Well, he didn't have sex.

21:18.900 --> 21:22.200
But he would tell you if he did
because the two of you were talking about sex.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.500
I love you. Okay?

21:23.600 --> 21:28.600
And I'm not gonna have
sex with Ben or...any other guy.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.300
I hope not. Because if you do,

21:34.400 --> 21:36.300
Adrian, I'm never gonna
have sex with you again.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.400
I feel the same way, Ricky.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.800
Look, I know you think it's okay for
you to have sex with anyone you want

21:42.900 --> 21:45.700
because of your family and
what happened to you growing up.

21:45.800 --> 21:50.800
But you're all grown up now, and you can't
keep blaming what you do on other people.

21:50.900 --> 21:55.700
You have a son, you have a job,
and you have an apartment.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.900
You're all on your own now,
so you are responsible for you.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.900
I'm not looking
the other way this year.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.900
I'm not.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.200
Okay.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.800
I'm not gonna look
the other way, either, then.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.600
So if you go off and
sleep with your brother again--

22:11.700 --> 22:15.300
Oh, whoa, whoa. My step-brother,
who I have no connection with?

22:15.400 --> 22:17.900
- Other than sex.
- I didn't know that bothered you so much.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.200
I'm just saying I'm not gonna
look the other way, either.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.700
- Okay!
- Okay.

22:25.000 --> 22:25.900
See you at school?

22:26.000 --> 22:28.600
Yeah. See you at school, Adrian.

22:28.700 --> 22:31.600
And you better not be with
Ben or Jack or anyone else.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.400
And...??

22:41.600 --> 22:43.100
You are the world's worst driver.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.400
- No, I'm not.
- No, you are.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.100
It's driver's education,
"education" being the key word.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.400
I am being educated
in the art of driving.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.100
Well, maybe that's your problem.
You're trying to make driving an art.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.800
It's a skill-- a learned skill.

22:55.900 --> 22:58.000
Sorry. I couldn't keep
my mind on the road.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.700
You know what I mean.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.200
Alice, please,
don't say anything.

23:02.300 --> 23:04.300
What? It was great.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.800
What was great?

23:06.100 --> 23:07.000
Henry.

23:07.100 --> 23:08.700
Whoa. What happened
to your eye?

23:08.800 --> 23:11.900
You don't wanna know. So,
how are you this morning? Recovered yet?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.500
I don't think you really
recover from a summer like that, Henry.

23:14.600 --> 23:17.000
I just think you learn to
put it all in perspective.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.400
- What did you do?
- Don't tell her.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.600
Fine. Don't tell me.
And I won't tell you.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.100
There's nothing to tell.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.000
Not really. Why?
Do you have something to tell me?

23:26.100 --> 23:28.100
No. Did you call Amy?

23:28.200 --> 23:32.300
Almost every day, for a while,
and then not so much.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.800
When was the last time
you talked to her?

23:33.900 --> 23:36.200
I don't know.
Maybe 10 days ago.

23:36.300 --> 23:37.400
You broke up.

23:37.500 --> 23:42.000
No. I left my phone charger at a hotel
I was staying at, and I never had the chance.

23:42.200 --> 23:43.800
We didn't break up.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.100
-  Not yet, anyway.
- Are you going to break up?

23:46.200 --> 23:48.500
I'm not going to break up with her,
but she may break up with me.

23:48.600 --> 23:52.400
Because you didn't call her? I don't think
she'd break up with you because you didn't call her.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.700
Did you do something else?

23:54.800 --> 23:55.700
Like?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.700
Like what you went there to do?

23:57.800 --> 24:01.400
I went there to work.
And I worked.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.800
Everything but
yearbook staff.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.900
Uh, yeah. That's when
I have home economics.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.700
You don't have to take
home economics. You can take P.E.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.000
- I wanna take home economics.
- Why?

24:15.100 --> 24:16.600
So I can learn
how to manage a home.

24:16.700 --> 24:18.300
What's so hard about
managing a home?

24:18.400 --> 24:20.500
I don't know,
but I guess I'll find out.

24:20.600 --> 24:23.700
I should've signed up for home economics.
Maybe I'll change from P.E.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.000
Then we won't have P.E. together.

24:26.300 --> 24:29.000
Well, then, maybe
I'll drop yearbook staff.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.300
- What?
- I don't wanna be alone.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.200
You're not alone.
You're at school.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.600
- You know what I mean.
- No.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.000
Oh, please. This isn't
about Jason, is it?

24:39.100 --> 24:40.300
Yes, it's about Jason.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.900
He might just be a brother to you,
but he was everything to me.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.600
No, he wasn't. He was
just someone to go out with

24:45.700 --> 24:47.400
that you were comfortable being with.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.200
You need a real boyfriend.
I need a real boyfriend.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.200
This is the year
we get boyfriends.

24:52.300 --> 24:54.500
I don't know if I can live through
the pain of another breakup.

24:54.600 --> 24:58.600
Me, either. I don't think I can live through
the pain of your going through another breakup.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.300
So here's the plan:
You had a boyfriend last year.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.000
I have a boyfriend this year.

25:04.100 --> 25:05.500
But I want a boyfriend, too.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.900
Then you'll just have to live
with the next painful breakup,

25:08.000 --> 25:10.400
and you'll have to
do better this time around.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.600
Hi, Madison.
How are you doing?

25:14.700 --> 25:15.900
I'm okay, I guess.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.700
Good. Good. Well,
have a nice day.

25:19.000 --> 25:19.900
Okay.

25:20.000 --> 25:21.400
Lauren.

25:25.100 --> 25:27.100
Maybe we're not broken up.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.300
No. You're broken up.

25:28.400 --> 25:31.200
Did you see how he touched me?
He was, like, this close to my face.

25:31.300 --> 25:35.200
Med camp. He's just trying to
instill confidence in you as a doctor.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.200
But he's not a doctor.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.300
Yeah, well,
try telling him that.

25:38.400 --> 25:42.100
Look, I'm telling you, you will
be happy you broke up with him.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.800
Hi. I'm new here.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.400
I'm Griffin.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.100
Okay, I'm not just new.
I'm also a freshman.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.700
Hi, freshman. Griffin.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.300
You don't look like a freshman.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.600
Are you freshmen?

25:57.700 --> 26:00.500
No. Do we look like freshmen?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.900
I don't know.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.600
Well, what are your names?

26:06.700 --> 26:07.800
- Madison.
- Lauren.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.400
Madison, Lauren, could you tell me
where the counselor's office is?

26:16.800 --> 26:19.700
I don't care if he's
a freshman. I'm taking him.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.400
Lauren, you can't
date a freshman.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.000
Yes, I can.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.500
When are they getting
a counselor?

26:27.600 --> 26:29.700
I don't know.
I hope they don't get one,

26:29.800 --> 26:33.200
'cause I get paid to do
two jobs until they do get one.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.500
Hi.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.400
Come back later.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.800
Maybe he needed something.

26:41.900 --> 26:44.200
Everybody needs something.
What do you need?

26:44.300 --> 26:47.500
A better...cup.

26:47.600 --> 26:49.500
Do they make a better cup
than the ones we already have?

26:49.600 --> 26:50.700
And why is that?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.500
Just concerned about injuries.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.300
- Grace?
- Grace?

26:54.400 --> 26:55.900
She went to brainiac camp, didn't she?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.900
Yeah. For future medical students.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
Future medical students? Please!

27:01.100 --> 27:04.700
What percentage of those students
do you think ever really reach med school?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.400
- I don't know.
- I don't know, either,

27:06.500 --> 27:09.500
but I do know that every year,
I lose a player to fear.

27:09.600 --> 27:11.600
Coach, I'm not afraid.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.200
I'm just being cautious.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.100
Because you're afraid
of a groin injury.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.300
I wanna have children
someday with Grace.

27:17.400 --> 27:23.100
Son, do you really think I'd be coaching
high school football if I thought for one minute

27:23.200 --> 27:27.200
that one of my players might get a groin injury
and will never be able to have children?

27:27.300 --> 27:30.300
Last year, Lucky Chucky
dropped out because of a groin injury.

27:30.400 --> 27:34.000
Yeah. Lucky Chucky
wasn't so lucky.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.600
Do you know where
his girlfriend spent her summer?

27:37.700 --> 27:39.000
Med camp?

27:40.100 --> 27:42.800
- Pneumonal.
- Try microscopic.

27:42.900 --> 27:45.500
- Silico vochino.
- Kineisis.

27:45.600 --> 27:47.400
That was hysterical.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.500
What was hysterical?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.300
Hi, Ricky. Good to see you.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.700
How are you, Grace?

27:57.800 --> 28:00.800
I'm fine, Ricky.
And how are you?

28:01.100 --> 28:02.800
I mean that. How are you?

28:02.900 --> 28:05.700
- Grace.
- Adrian!

28:07.200 --> 28:10.500
- Are you doing okay?
- Oh. I think so.

28:10.600 --> 28:11.900
What's with the close talk?

28:12.000 --> 28:14.600
Oh, nothing. It's a doctor technique.
How was your summer?

28:14.700 --> 28:18.000
Oh, we were busy. Really busy.
Weren't we, Ricky?

28:18.100 --> 28:20.700
Yeah. I worked at the butcher shop
and spent a lot of time with John.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.100
- And me.
- And her.

28:23.700 --> 28:25.200
- "Her"?
- And how's John?

28:25.300 --> 28:27.400
Oh. Thank you for asking.
He's fine.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.300
- And Amy?
- She's fine, too. Until Ben breaks up with her.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.600
- Ben is breaking up with her?
- Maybe.

28:32.700 --> 28:33.800
Are you still talking to Ben?

28:33.900 --> 28:36.000
Oh, there's no harm in
just talking to someone.

28:36.100 --> 28:40.000
No, there is, depending on who you're
talking to and what you're talking about.

29:25.500 --> 29:29.900
What...is...life?

29:30.100 --> 29:31.900
Anyone know the answer?

29:32.000 --> 29:33.600
Of course not.

29:33.700 --> 29:37.000
All we know is
that there is life.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.000
And from life...

29:40.400 --> 29:41.400
comes life.

29:41.500 --> 29:46.000
If I just focus on what she's saying,
maybe I won't think about oral sex.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.400
- Don't think about it. Don't...
- The indication that life is present...

29:50.600 --> 29:51.700
Oh.

29:52.100 --> 29:55.200
Wait. What did she just say?

29:55.300 --> 30:00.900
I didn't even know what I was doing,
which means I don't know if I can do that again.

30:01.000 --> 30:04.300
The pressure. I hate the pressure.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.100
We adapt.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.200
I bet they're doing it.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.500
Am I the only person
in here thinking about sex?

30:15.300 --> 30:18.700
I don't know. Maybe I should've
had sex with Jason.

30:18.800 --> 30:22.900
But he didn't ask me.
I wonder why he didn't ask me.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.100
I'm sexy. I know, I know.

30:25.200 --> 30:28.800
Sexy is as sexy does.
Or is it pretty is as pretty does?

30:28.900 --> 30:30.400
I'd rather feel sexy than pretty.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.900
Well, on the other hand--
Uh-oh. Did she just call on me?

30:34.000 --> 30:39.100
- Smile.
- The ground forces the seed into a sprout,

30:40.200 --> 30:42.200
and then a flower.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.000
Whew.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.700
Oh, geez.
The old pistil and stamen.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.000
Could we just get to
the nitty-gritty?

30:49.100 --> 30:53.100
Or could you point me to
the direction of a nice pistil?

30:54.400 --> 30:55.900
Really.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
Wow. They're really
paying attention.

31:01.100 --> 31:04.200
I'm finally gonna
have a good year.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.500
Finally.

31:09.700 --> 31:14.400
Amy Juergens, you're the most beautiful,
most frustrating woman on earth.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.000
You're dismissed.
Except for you two.

31:25.600 --> 31:29.300
You two can copy chapter 1
into your little notebooks.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.500
It's basically
everything that I said.

31:31.600 --> 31:36.400
Now, I know we all know what you said,
but maybe you'd like to know what I said.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.600
Not really.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.400
Not really.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.100
Hey there.
How's your day going?

31:51.700 --> 31:52.800
Who wants to know?

31:52.900 --> 31:55.800
Oh. Nice attitude. Griffin.

31:56.200 --> 31:59.200
Ashley, the teen mother's sister.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.100
Well, I know that's why
everyone's staring at me.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.800
I'm the sister.

32:03.700 --> 32:06.900
I-- I'm new here.
I don't know anything about that.

32:07.000 --> 32:09.900
Well, my sister's in the tenth grade,
and she had a baby last year.

32:10.000 --> 32:14.000
Wow. Uh, I mean,
you know, stuff happens.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.600
Yeah.

32:15.700 --> 32:17.800
Well, maybe you can
point her out to me.

32:17.900 --> 32:19.500
Oh, she's pretty easy to spot.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.200
She's the really pretty one with
the French horn who's unusually tired.

32:22.300 --> 32:24.600
Is she tired from dragging
around the horn or the baby?

32:24.700 --> 32:28.200
The baby, and just
from being Amy.

32:29.100 --> 32:31.600
So, are you planning to get
pregnant your first year here?

32:31.700 --> 32:35.300
No. Sorry. I'm not. I'm not even
planning to date my first year here.

32:35.600 --> 32:37.200
Maybe not even
any year here, you know?

32:37.300 --> 32:40.600
I don't want guys to think I'd have sex
just 'cause my sister had sex once.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.300
Is that true?
It was just once?

32:42.400 --> 32:44.600
- Yeah.
- Uh...

32:44.700 --> 32:47.300
Believe me, when you meet her,
you'll realize it's totally true.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.500
All right.
So you have lunch now?

32:50.600 --> 32:51.300
Yep.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.700
Do you wanna
have lunch with me?

32:52.800 --> 32:54.300
You make it sound
as if it's a date.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.000
No, it's not a date.
It's a lame attempt to make sure

32:57.100 --> 32:59.700
I'm not sitting by
myself in the lunchroom.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.400
Not that I haven't before.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.600
All right. As long as you're not
gonna try to have sex with me.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.700
I'm not gonna try to
have sex with you.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.500
I'm gay, okay?

33:09.600 --> 33:12.500
It's okay with me. Wow.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.700
Maybe we could even be friends.

33:15.300 --> 33:16.700
You know, I don't think
I've ever had a friend before,

33:16.800 --> 33:19.600
and my dad's been really
 anxious for me to make one.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.800
Is this guy bothering you?

33:23.900 --> 33:25.600
Ah, the father but not
the boyfriend.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.600
Ricky, Griffin.
Griffin, Ricky.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.800
And no, he's not bothering me.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.300
All right. Well,
I was just looking out for you.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.600
I don't need anyone
to look out for me.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.100
Come on.

33:37.200 --> 33:38.700
You got it.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.700
I think you could be
wrong about that.

33:43.700 --> 33:45.000
Aha!

33:46.500 --> 33:48.300
- "Aha"?
- I knew when she walked through the door

33:48.400 --> 33:50.200
that you would go after her.

33:50.300 --> 33:52.000
- Who?
- Ashley. That's who.

33:52.100 --> 33:54.200
Don't be ridiculous.
She's Amy's little sister.

33:54.300 --> 33:56.300
So? So she's
Amy's little sister.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.000
You think I'd go
after my son's aunt?

33:58.100 --> 34:00.000
I don't think that would
stop you from going after her--

34:00.100 --> 34:01.600
the fact that
she's your son's aunt.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.700
Look, let's not play
this game, all right?

34:03.800 --> 34:06.800
Either we trust each other,
or we don't trust each other.

34:06.900 --> 34:09.199
- Do you trust me, or don't you?
- Do you trust me?

34:09.300 --> 34:11.000
- No.
- I don't trust you either.

34:11.100 --> 34:14.500
Then I guess it's just a matter
of not getting caught, isn't it?

34:18.300 --> 34:20.500
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah, Grace. Have a seat.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.900
- I want to talk to you.
- Okay.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.699
I don't want you to see or talk to Jack Pappas
for the rest of the football season.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.400
It's not good for the team.
It's not good for Jack.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.400
But why?

34:35.500 --> 34:36.699
I don't want him distracted.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.500
The other players
have girlfriends.

34:38.600 --> 34:40.699
Not girlfriends
who wanna be doctors.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.500
I don't like those
kind of girlfriends.

34:42.600 --> 34:45.600
- Why not?
- I don't want my players
afraid of getting hurt.

34:45.699 --> 34:49.300
If all Jack can think about is getting injured,
he's not gonna be much use to me.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.800
Well, maybe he shouldn't
play football.

34:50.900 --> 34:52.300
Maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.100
Maybe you shouldn't be
the counselor and the football coach.

34:55.199 --> 34:56.699
But I am.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.500
You're right, Coach. You are.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.300
I completely understand.

35:03.400 --> 35:06.600
I don't want Jack or any of the other
players worried about groin injuries.

35:06.700 --> 35:09.500
- That should be the last thing on their mind.
- I agree.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.600
Which is why I think you should look
into a groin-strengthening program.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.800
It's 15, 20 minutes
a day at the most.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.900
And it's cutting groin
injuries in half.

35:17.100 --> 35:19.600
Don't say "cut" and "groin"
in the same sentence, Doc.

35:19.700 --> 35:21.000
Thanks for the tip.

35:21.100 --> 35:23.100
You want me to get you
the information on the program?

35:23.200 --> 35:25.000
Preventative medicine
is the best medicine.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.600
And when the players don't have to
worry about those types of injuries,

35:27.700 --> 35:30.000
I bet they'll be able to
focus on the game.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.400
Oh, you're good.

35:32.500 --> 35:34.900
Thanks. I was top of
my class at camp.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.700
Are you thinking of getting
into sports medicine?

35:36.800 --> 35:38.900
I am kind of interested in it.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.400
I got interested in
it because of Jack.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.400
All right.
You can go out with him.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.400
Just don't talk to him.

35:46.500 --> 35:49.300
I'll try not to. Thanks, Coach.

35:57.700 --> 35:59.900
I mean, um, maybe I could
get a schedule change.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.400
- Yeah, maybe you could.
- But I'd hate to do that.

36:03.700 --> 36:07.400
Because even if we do break up,
I hope we can still be friends.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.700
Yeah. I hope we can
still be friends, too.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.400
Is that what you want--
just to be friends?

36:15.500 --> 36:18.100
No, that's not what I want.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.800
But I can understand if that's all you want,
especially after your summer in Italy.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.400
Amy, wait.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.300
I didn't do anything.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.900
I just took some time to
see the country while I was there.

36:29.000 --> 36:31.800
- With your girlfriend.
- No. She was just a girl I worked with.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.000
I went with her
and her girlfriend.

36:33.100 --> 36:35.500
They wanted to show me
some things before I left.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.100
Girlfriend girlfriend,
or girlfriend?

36:38.200 --> 36:40.300
- They're not gay.
- Oh.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.600
Neither am I.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.400
And I'm not either,
but what does that mean?

36:46.900 --> 36:48.800
I still love you, Amy.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.600
But I'm a guy,
and I want to have sex.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.900
- And if we're not gonna have sex, then--
- Then you're breaking up with me.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.300
- No.
- If that's all you want,
I'm breaking up with you.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.300
That is not what
I was going to say.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.000
I was gonna say, then we have to
find some things we have in common.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.800
We have to find some things to
do together with John as a family.

37:09.800 --> 37:14.200
We have to find a way to spend time together
and enjoy being with each other.

37:15.500 --> 37:19.700
And I hope we can do that, Amy,
because I do love you.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.400
Really?

37:21.500 --> 37:22.800
Really.

37:23.500 --> 37:25.600
I'm 16, and I have a baby.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.200
Yeah.

37:31.900 --> 37:36.100
This is turning out to maybe not be such
a bad first day of school after all.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.600
You still love me.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.400
I'm so happy that
you still love me, Ben.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.400
Once I get home,
David's getting me a new car.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.700
Does your dad know about that?

37:51.600 --> 37:55.700
Well, then I would
hold off...??

38:03.100 --> 38:06.600
Look who's home!
My little John!

38:07.300 --> 38:09.000
How's my little John?

38:09.100 --> 38:12.600
How are you, sweetie?
How was it, Ash?

38:13.100 --> 38:14.400
How was...

38:14.500 --> 38:15.700
Your first day of high school?

38:15.800 --> 38:18.200
That. Um, it was fine.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.000
Fine? I want details.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.200
Well, the bell rang,
and I went to class.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.700
The bell rang,
I went to the next class.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.800
The bell rang again,
and I went to another class.

38:28.900 --> 38:30.800
And then the bell rang,
and I went to lunch.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.800
How was lunch?
Did Amy sit with you?

38:32.900 --> 38:34.600
No. She has her own friends.

38:34.700 --> 38:38.200
- So did you sit all by yourself?
- Mom, I'm not a total loser.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.200
I did not sit by myself.
I sat with a guy.

38:41.300 --> 38:42.700
- A guy?
- Yeah, a guy.

38:42.800 --> 38:46.100
Well, Ashley, I hope that you're gonna
have some girlfriends as well as boyfriends.

38:46.200 --> 38:48.100
I'm sure you're gonna be
very popular with the boys.

38:48.200 --> 38:50.500
But it's nice to have some girlfriends,
too, don't you think?

38:50.600 --> 38:53.100
- I don't know.
- Well, so, it went okay, right?

38:53.200 --> 38:55.000
- Yeah.
- Good.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.100
Where's Amy?

38:57.200 --> 38:59.700
She's talking to Dad.
They told me to come in here.

38:59.800 --> 39:03.400
- What are they talking about?
- I don't know. That's why they sent me in here.

39:08.300 --> 39:10.900
Mom, I think I might've
done something bad.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.200
- What something bad?
- Well, I told Dad about the car.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.900
- What?
- I just thought he should know.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.800
But I told you that I was
gonna talk to David about it.

39:16.900 --> 39:19.600
- Did you?
- No, I told him to wait,
and we would talk about it later.

39:19.700 --> 39:22.000
- The three of us?
- No, Amy. The two of us.

39:22.100 --> 39:24.300
He wants to buy me a car.
It's a brand-new SUV.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.600
- Well, Amy, he can't.
- He can't? He already did.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.000
He's supposed to bring
it home this afternoon,

39:28.100 --> 39:30.900
and I just didn't want Dad
to get upset when it got here.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.600
- Where's your dad?
- I guess on his way back to work.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.600
- Ashley, call him.
- Who?

39:35.700 --> 39:38.100
- Your father!
- Oh, right.

39:43.100 --> 39:44.900
- Ash.
- Dad?

39:45.800 --> 39:47.200
What do you want?

39:50.600 --> 39:53.100
- Motorcycle accident?
- It's nothing. I'm selling the bike.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.800
- Good.
- I was on my way to
your boyfriend's office,

39:54.900 --> 39:56.800
but apparently he's already
left for the car dealership.

39:56.900 --> 40:00.400
Look, I told him that I was gonna talk
to him later, which is my way of saying no.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.900
I just hadn't gotten around
to the "no" part yet.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.500
Yeah, I'll get to that part.
He's not bribing my daughter with a car.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.400
- SUV.
- Girls, I need a minute with your mother.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.300
Now!

40:22.500 --> 40:24.700
I lied. I didn't have a vasectomy.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.600
Oh, nice. I thought
maybe it just came undone.

40:27.700 --> 40:30.400
No, I lied.
So I'm just gonna say it.

40:30.500 --> 40:31.600
I think that's my baby, Anne.

40:31.700 --> 40:33.200
Yeah, I think it is, too.

40:33.900 --> 40:37.300
In fact, I know it is.
David knows it, too.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.600
I figured that if you weren't
in love with me anymore,

40:39.700 --> 40:41.300
if you didn't want me
or the baby, then--

40:41.400 --> 40:43.400
What are you talking about?
I love you. I've always loved you.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.100
Well, why didn't
you say anything?

40:45.200 --> 40:47.000
Especially after you
thought it was your baby?

40:47.100 --> 40:49.400
Because I thought-- I thought
you were in love with this guy,

40:49.500 --> 40:51.400
and I thought he was
everything you wanted.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.800
You deserve to have
whatever you want.

40:53.900 --> 40:55.500
If you're not in love with this guy,
and you knew it was my baby,

40:55.600 --> 40:57.100
why'd you serve me
with divorce papers?

40:57.200 --> 40:59.400
- Why'd you sign them?
- I thought you didn't love me anymore.

40:59.500 --> 41:03.200
And I thought you didn't want the baby
to be my baby even if you knew it was my baby.

41:03.300 --> 41:05.200
Obviously, you didn't wanna
have any more children with me,

41:05.300 --> 41:06.900
or you wouldn't have
insisted I get neutered.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
I didn't plan on having
any more children, George.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.400
We weren't planning on
having the first two.

41:10.500 --> 41:14.200
How did you manage not to get me pregnant
for 10 years after you lied about the vasectomy?

41:14.300 --> 41:16.400
Calendar. I kept a calendar.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.600
As the years went on,
chances grew slimmer.

41:18.700 --> 41:22.800
You relied on a stupid calendar
for birth control? Are you insane?

41:22.900 --> 41:24.700
Hey, I didn't care
if we got pregnant or not.

41:24.800 --> 41:26.100
I always wanted another child.

41:26.200 --> 41:30.700
David loves me, and he's willing
to take care of me and the baby.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.900
We're not in love,
but we love each other.

41:33.000 --> 41:36.200
And we're happy, pretty much.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.400
- "Pretty much"?
- Well, it's very comfortable.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.100
"Comfortable"? You're
settling for comfortable?

41:40.200 --> 41:42.400
I'm comfortable with comfortable.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.100
And I like working with him,
and he wants a family.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.100
Well, he can't have my family.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.800
The three of you-- you, Amy and John--
moving up to that house you're renovating?

41:49.900 --> 41:51.800
Amy doesn't wanna move.

41:52.000 --> 41:54.200
We have a guest house for her,
but she doesn't wanna move.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.900
She wants to stay here
and finish high school.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.900
But David thinks that
she'd be better off there.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.400
- He thinks she'll be very happy there.
- Who cares what David thinks?

42:01.500 --> 42:03.300
And why would she do
better there than here?

42:03.400 --> 42:05.900
If she did agree to move, you're gonna
leave Ashley here and never see her again?

42:06.000 --> 42:08.100
No. I figured that Ashley
would come up on the weekends,

42:08.200 --> 42:12.300
and that maybe later on, she would
move in with us if she wanted, if you wanted.

42:12.600 --> 42:15.500
Look, I know that Ashley's
very happy living with you.

42:15.700 --> 42:18.100
She's happier living with
her dad than with her mom.

42:18.200 --> 42:20.500
It's every teenage girl's dream
and every mother's worst nightmare.

42:20.600 --> 42:24.200
I know. I read, you know.
Well, not fiction, but I do read.

42:24.400 --> 42:27.000
That's why I thought it'd be
best if we stayed close by.

42:27.600 --> 42:30.900
Anne, you can't move.
You can't take Amy.

42:31.000 --> 42:34.700
You can't take John. You can't take
my grandson. And you can't take our baby.

42:36.100 --> 42:38.800
He can't take you. I love you.

42:38.900 --> 42:42.400
- So you lied about the vasectomy?
- Yeah.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.500
So it is my baby?

42:44.600 --> 42:46.800
Well, unless the due date
is way off, it's yours.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.500
I can fix this. I can fix it.

42:48.600 --> 42:51.600
George, I think that things
have gone too far to fix.

42:51.700 --> 42:54.000
David and I have
worked it all out.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.300
It's too late.

42:56.400 --> 42:59.000
It's never too late.
Let me fix it.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.700
How?
