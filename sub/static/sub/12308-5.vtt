00:03.420 --> 00:06.446
Atlantis, this is Sheppard.
I'm on approach to the Gate.

00:06.526 --> 00:07.498
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

00:07.883 --> 00:11.096
You know, since I've been in Pegasus,
I have set up, like, what,

00:11.176 --> 00:14.654
half a dozen research stations
on various planets and I remember you

00:14.734 --> 00:18.153
ever volunteering to run
a re-supply mission to any of them.

00:19.047 --> 00:22.218
I'm a busy man, Rodney. Just
happened to have a little free time.

00:22.298 --> 00:23.567
<i>And Doctor Mackenzie just</i>

00:23.678 --> 00:27.340
happens to be studying a primitive
tribe that lives in a tropical paradise

00:27.426 --> 00:30.750
and has, how did he put it,
"little or no social inhibitions."

00:30.974 --> 00:32.768
Well, they were very friendly.

00:35.322 --> 00:36.322
What the hell?

00:37.100 --> 00:38.121
What is it?

00:41.368 --> 00:43.205
I think somebody just took a shot at me.

00:43.774 --> 00:45.734
<i>I've got a contact.
They're closin' fast.</i>

00:45.814 --> 00:47.041
What is it, Wraith?

00:47.205 --> 00:48.633
I don't think so, but...

00:51.195 --> 00:53.698
Whatever they're shooting me
with just shorted my systems.

00:53.778 --> 00:55.438
I can't get weapons online.

01:02.275 --> 01:04.998
Can you make it back to the Gate?
Sheppard?

01:05.441 --> 01:06.517
Sheppard?

01:08.326 --> 01:09.231
Rodney?

01:09.846 --> 01:10.843
McKay?

02:36.511 --> 02:37.637
Nice ship.

02:38.149 --> 02:39.404
Little bit of a...

02:39.852 --> 02:42.887
Little bit of a fixer-upper
but I can see the potential.

02:50.345 --> 02:52.546
I'm not talking about
anything drastic, you know.

02:52.648 --> 02:56.015
Maybe just a paint job,
some throw pillows...

03:01.532 --> 03:02.517
Look,

03:02.770 --> 03:05.115
I don't suppose you mind
telling me what's going on here?

03:06.175 --> 03:08.829
Here's how we're gonna do this:
I'm gonna ask you questions

03:08.909 --> 03:10.262
and you're gonna give me answers.

03:10.342 --> 03:12.346
- Is that simple enough for you?
- Sure.

03:13.254 --> 03:16.234
Who are you, where are you from,
and where'd you get your ship?

03:16.848 --> 03:18.464
See, that's a funny coincidence,

03:18.544 --> 03:21.241
`cause I was gonna ask you
the same exact questions.

03:26.621 --> 03:29.682
The difference is, I'm not the one
whose hands are tied behind his back.

03:30.723 --> 03:31.660
<i>So again,</i>

03:31.822 --> 03:35.134
who are you, where are you
from, and where did you get your ship?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.208
<i>- What happened?
- I'm not entirely sure.</i>

03:42.310 --> 03:44.919
Looks like his Jumper was
attacked before he reached the Gate.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.460
- By who?
- The people on the planet

03:46.542 --> 03:48.785
aren't much past mud huts and blow darts
so we can assume

03:48.887 --> 03:50.780
they had nothing to do with it.
What we do know

03:50.862 --> 03:53.203
is that just after we lost contact
there was a short burst

03:53.326 --> 03:55.016
of radiation in the vicinity of the Gate

03:55.096 --> 03:57.242
consistent with the opening
of a hyperspace window.

03:57.412 --> 03:59.243
- Wraith?
- Sheppard didn't seem to think so,

03:59.345 --> 04:02.516
and what little sensor data we've been
able to pick up seems to confirm it.

04:02.618 --> 04:05.133
The energy signature's all wrong.
It's inconsistent with Ancient

04:05.235 --> 04:07.584
technology as well,
which rules out the Replicators.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.679
We know no other peoples in this galaxy
that possess hyperspace technology

04:10.760 --> 04:13.767
Of course not. No-one reaches that level
of advancement without being culled.

04:13.869 --> 04:15.966
So, then, who was it?

04:18.732 --> 04:20.543
<i>I could do this all day.</i>

04:22.161 --> 04:23.924
Your knuckles will get sore eventually.

04:31.478 --> 04:32.857
Has he said anything?

04:32.937 --> 04:35.520
Only his name: Reed Richards.

04:36.855 --> 04:38.197
His name is Sheppard.

04:38.622 --> 04:41.193
We intercepted
part of his last radio transmission.

04:41.737 --> 04:43.084
I didn't get your name.

04:45.777 --> 04:47.320
You can call me Larrin.

04:49.139 --> 04:50.630
You really should co-operate.

04:51.239 --> 04:53.012
Be a shame to have
to do too much damage.

04:54.539 --> 04:55.494
I agree.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.437
Maybe if you guys tell me
who you are and

05:00.113 --> 05:01.114
what you want,

05:01.752 --> 05:03.479
we could work out some kind of a deal.

05:03.581 --> 05:05.868
Well, don't get my hopes
up and then disappoint me.

05:06.733 --> 05:09.089
Tell him what happened
to the last man that disappointed me.

05:09.191 --> 05:11.482
We don't know. We never found his body.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.295
We assumed you blew him out into space.

05:16.177 --> 05:17.177
I get it.

05:18.128 --> 05:18.948
Good.

05:20.296 --> 05:21.305
Bring him.

05:23.729 --> 05:24.657
Get up.

05:36.459 --> 05:38.014
Another form of torture?

05:38.094 --> 05:40.113
When you spend as much
time in space as we do,

05:40.193 --> 05:41.684
you don't get a lot of fresh food.

05:43.423 --> 05:44.429
How much

05:44.606 --> 05:46.825
time are we talking about?

05:50.938 --> 05:52.734
This is a conversation, right?

05:53.207 --> 05:54.572
A two-way street?

05:55.562 --> 05:57.167
This is our home.

05:59.452 --> 06:01.493
- This ship?
- And others like it.

06:02.064 --> 06:03.250
We're travellers.

06:05.154 --> 06:07.167
You live in space all the time?

06:07.303 --> 06:10.731
We land on planets
when we need to for supplies, trade.

06:11.124 --> 06:12.920
The rest of the time we keep moving.

06:13.174 --> 06:14.386
From the Wraith?

06:15.034 --> 06:16.603
<i>That may have been how it started,</i>

06:17.692 --> 06:19.181
but now it's just who we are.

06:20.758 --> 06:22.493
Well, no offence, Larrin.

06:23.085 --> 06:24.779
Doesn't sound like much of a life.

06:25.376 --> 06:27.662
Being a herd animal
isn't much of a life.

06:28.788 --> 06:29.849
Besides,

06:31.389 --> 06:33.348
the food has all the nutrients required.

06:34.267 --> 06:36.678
Well, as tempting as that sounds,

06:37.060 --> 06:39.101
my jaw's a little sore right now.

06:40.253 --> 06:42.416
Things like that are
necessary from time to time.

06:42.858 --> 06:45.368
Although it's not the most efficient way
of getting information,

06:45.448 --> 06:47.124
it does help people to understand

06:49.122 --> 06:50.265
their situation.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.352
My situation being

06:52.811 --> 06:54.137
completely at your mercy.

06:54.508 --> 06:55.447
Exactly.

06:56.197 --> 06:58.244
<i>Anyway, I know more
about you than you think.</i>

06:59.148 --> 07:00.053
Really?

07:01.229 --> 07:04.593
For instance, I know you carry the gene
required to operate Lantian technology.

07:06.057 --> 07:07.137
I've got the what?

07:08.905 --> 07:11.160
Look, Sheppard,
I know you have your secrets,

07:11.240 --> 07:14.370
and if you stay on my good side,
I may even let you keep a few of them.

07:14.450 --> 07:17.085
However, if you continue
to play ignorant with me,

07:17.841 --> 07:20.193
I really will jettison you out
into space.

07:21.398 --> 07:24.596
For some time now, we've been hearing
rumours about a new group of humans in

07:24.676 --> 07:27.993
the galaxy using the technology of the
Ancestors to do battle with the Wraith,

07:28.735 --> 07:32.082
so we set up a network of spy satellites
around dozens of worlds

07:32.164 --> 07:34.843
with space Gates,
hoping for an encounter.

07:36.155 --> 07:37.438
Eventually we got lucky.

07:37.687 --> 07:41.046
In the first meeting between our people,
you attack me and disarm my ship.

07:41.199 --> 07:44.415
Well, you were going through the Gate
and I couldn't let that happen.

07:44.543 --> 07:47.550
You see, anyone capable
of operating Lantian technology

07:47.639 --> 07:49.804
is of particular interest to us.

07:50.447 --> 07:52.356
That's why you took
a sample of my blood.

07:52.438 --> 07:56.098
We're working on a control interface
adaptor that requires a small amount

07:56.178 --> 07:58.021
of necessary genetic material.

07:58.793 --> 08:00.420
We needed your blood to test it.

08:01.486 --> 08:03.109
I'm gonna guess it didn't go so well.

08:03.886 --> 08:04.890
Why would you say that?

08:04.970 --> 08:06.900
Then you wouldn't have
any use for me any more.

08:06.980 --> 08:08.518
Don't underestimate yourself.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.623
There's all kinds of useful
things you could do for me.

08:13.024 --> 08:15.123
<i>Commander,
we're approaching the coordinates.</i>

08:15.986 --> 08:18.228
Understood. Take us out of hyperspace.

08:18.939 --> 08:22.045
Of course, you're right. The interface
isn't fully operational yet.

08:22.966 --> 08:23.991
<i>Come with me.</i>

08:28.262 --> 08:30.389
Nevik, my chief science officer, insists

08:30.469 --> 08:33.373
that we have a much better chance
of perfecting the interface

08:33.455 --> 08:36.323
if we reverse-engineer it
using Lantian technology

08:36.784 --> 08:38.255
that's already been initialised.

08:38.337 --> 08:40.999
I don't even know
what reverse engineering is.

08:43.039 --> 08:44.236
You wanna use my ship.

08:44.648 --> 08:45.719
Not exactly.

08:55.651 --> 08:56.946
Activate the force shield.

09:01.225 --> 09:02.735
<i>Sheppard, can you hear me?</i>

09:04.245 --> 09:05.922
D'you mind telling me what you're doing?

09:06.499 --> 09:07.785
Offering you a deal.

09:08.646 --> 09:10.009
Open the Hangar Bay doors.

09:19.399 --> 09:21.938
This is just not right!

09:22.604 --> 09:25.706
Don't worry. You're safe as long as
the force shield doesn't malfunction,

09:25.788 --> 09:27.650
and that almost never happens.

09:27.946 --> 09:29.757
Why are you doing this?

09:30.351 --> 09:33.136
<i>You wanted to know what
this is all about. Look beneath you.</i>

09:37.482 --> 09:39.655
<i>I'm assuming
you recognise the technology?</i>

09:40.059 --> 09:41.547
<i>It's a Lantian battleship.</i>

09:41.749 --> 09:43.507
It's been dormant
for thousands of years,

09:43.587 --> 09:46.004
and you're gonna help me
get it operational again.

10:01.073 --> 10:03.315
<i>Has it occurred to you
they might have abandoned the ship</i>

10:03.397 --> 10:05.037
for a good reason in the first place?

10:05.255 --> 10:08.193
We know the reason.
We were able to access the ship's logs.

10:08.273 --> 10:09.744
They were attacked by the Wraith.

10:09.824 --> 10:12.066
They lost communication
and the shields were failing.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.619
The engines were damaged as well but
they managed to escape into hyperspace,

10:16.140 --> 10:19.283
then they realised that their main
drive was giving off deadly radiation.

10:19.363 --> 10:21.042
They were forced to abandon ship.

10:21.122 --> 10:24.158
They intended to return and effect
repairs but never got the chance.

10:24.472 --> 10:27.431
The ship's been drifting
in a two hundred year elliptical orbit

10:27.513 --> 10:29.533
around a nearby dwarf star ever since.

10:30.368 --> 10:31.624
So it's never been fixed?

10:32.614 --> 10:35.096
- No.
<i>- I hate to point out the obvious,</i>

10:35.176 --> 10:38.456
but one of the reasons I agreed to help
you was so that you wouldn't kill me.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.387
<i>If I'm gonna die of radiation anyway...</i>

10:40.467 --> 10:42.395
Don't worry.
We've set up shield emitters

10:42.475 --> 10:44.112
to protect key areas of the ship,

10:44.192 --> 10:46.259
and we've all got radiation detectors.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.830
Take him to the Bridge.
Start with sub-light propulsion.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.243
I'll go check the emitters.

10:53.807 --> 10:55.920
Don't think I can get one of those too,
do you?

11:00.997 --> 11:02.006
Here.

11:05.227 --> 11:07.831
You know this ship is
ten thousand years old?

11:09.496 --> 11:12.624
I'm just saying for the record.
If it doesn't work, it's not my fault.

11:12.704 --> 11:13.791
Just get on with it.

11:21.715 --> 11:25.212
It's amazing. I've been trying
for 2 months to activate these systems.

11:25.792 --> 11:28.168
I need to calibrate the interface
from your neural input.

11:28.401 --> 11:30.468
Why don't you start
by moving the ship forward?

11:30.897 --> 11:32.217
You sure about that?

11:32.297 --> 11:33.520
That's why we're here.

11:33.876 --> 11:37.021
You fly the ship and I record
the inputs so I can replicate them.

11:37.352 --> 11:39.053
- OK, but...
- Enough.

11:39.980 --> 11:41.236
Fly the damn ship.

11:43.131 --> 11:44.131
Right....

11:45.629 --> 11:46.845
I just was gonna say,

11:47.271 --> 11:49.552
you said,
"Start by moving the ship forward,

11:50.189 --> 11:53.700
when you should have said, "Start
by initialising the inertial dampeners."

11:53.780 --> 11:54.740
Wait!

12:06.852 --> 12:09.012
My friend's got a gun just like this.

12:09.397 --> 12:11.941
- Always wondered where he'd got it.
- I'm gonna kill you.

12:17.855 --> 12:19.064
Silas, what happened?

12:22.043 --> 12:23.683
<i>Nevik, what's going on up there?</i>

12:23.775 --> 12:26.295
Sorry, your people are unavailable
right now.

12:27.327 --> 12:28.783
Sheppard, what are you doing?

12:28.970 --> 12:30.187
<i>You said, "Fly the ship."</i>

12:30.355 --> 12:31.591
I'm flying the ship.

12:41.918 --> 12:46.102
We had a deal. I was prepared
to let you go in exchange for your help.

12:46.247 --> 12:48.812
Sorry. I've never been able
to trust anyone who kidnaps me,

12:48.892 --> 12:51.091
tortures me and threatens
to blow me into space.

12:59.424 --> 13:00.449
We've got nothing.

13:00.529 --> 13:02.300
There's no wreckage,
no transponder signal.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.125
If he was down there,
we'd have found him.

13:04.205 --> 13:05.805
- Then where is he?
- He's not in orbit

13:05.885 --> 13:08.465
and he's not on the planet. The only
logical assumption is whoever

13:08.545 --> 13:11.478
attacked him must have brought him on
board before jumping into hyperspace.

13:11.558 --> 13:14.082
- So what's the next step?
- There is no next step.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.770
Look, we have no way of tracing him. He
could be anywhere in the galaxy by now.

13:17.850 --> 13:20.265
I'm sorry, but sometimes
there is just nothing we can do.

13:21.979 --> 13:25.295
<i>Sheppard? I want you
to drop this ship out of hyperspace.</i>

13:25.424 --> 13:26.890
I don't think so.

13:27.066 --> 13:28.273
<i>Listen to me.</i>

13:28.353 --> 13:31.058
I've shut off the shield emitters
protecting your area of the ship.

13:31.138 --> 13:33.768
Right now, the Bridge
is being flooded with radiation.

13:37.531 --> 13:38.710
You're bluffing.

13:39.395 --> 13:41.221
You'd never sacrifice your own people.

13:48.984 --> 13:52.362
<i>I don't wanna kill you, but if you don't
turn over the controls of this ship,</i>

13:52.442 --> 13:53.590
<i>I'll have no choice.</i>

14:07.949 --> 14:09.486
You surprised me, Sheppard.

14:10.098 --> 14:12.259
Well, as long as
I didn't disappoint you.

14:12.658 --> 14:16.140
Oh no, I knew you'd make
some sort of a move. I just...

14:16.538 --> 14:19.168
wasn't expecting anything quite so...

14:19.436 --> 14:21.367
Clever? Creative?

14:21.477 --> 14:24.881
Reckless. You could have killed
all of us, including yourself.

14:25.609 --> 14:29.019
I once pulled eleven gees
in an F-16 without passing out.

14:29.099 --> 14:31.633
- I figured I had a shot.
- Why, I underestimated you.

14:31.713 --> 14:33.005
Yeah, I feel the same way.

14:33.085 --> 14:36.158
I mean, you've got the whole
tough-as-nails routine down pat,

14:36.238 --> 14:39.016
but exposing your own people
to killer radiation?

14:39.693 --> 14:42.640
Takes a special kind of lady
to do that, doesn't it?

14:43.851 --> 14:44.851
Larrin?

14:48.944 --> 14:51.706
It's not good. He shut down
propulsion and navigation systems

14:51.786 --> 14:53.564
before he turned over the Bridge.

14:53.832 --> 14:54.850
Of course he did!

14:56.048 --> 14:58.543
<i>Did you collect enough data
to finish the control interface?</i>

14:58.623 --> 14:59.739
<i>I don't know. Maybe.</i>

14:59.850 --> 15:02.135
Nevik, if you can't do this,
we're stranded.

15:04.622 --> 15:05.639
What about him?

15:05.719 --> 15:08.380
He's not going anywhere near
that bridge again. He can't be trusted.

15:08.460 --> 15:11.677
If we can't bring that system back
online, he'll die like the rest of us.

15:11.757 --> 15:15.101
That's the problem! Does he look like
a man who thinks he's going to die?

15:18.107 --> 15:20.245
Check the sub-space
communications array.

15:20.423 --> 15:23.009
Ancients lost the communications
in the battle with the Wraith.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.559
The system was never repaired.

15:25.235 --> 15:26.338
Check it.

15:43.194 --> 15:43.978
What've you got?

15:44.107 --> 15:46.746
Ah. Remember how I said
sometimes there's nothing we can do?

15:46.830 --> 15:50.432
I was right about that... only it turns
out this is not one of those times.

15:51.292 --> 15:52.193
You found him.

15:52.273 --> 15:54.174
More like he found us. Listen to this.

15:56.434 --> 15:58.173
That is the sound of sub-space.

15:58.567 --> 16:01.667
It's mostly just random noise
generated by various forms of radiation,

16:01.777 --> 16:04.973
but the Ancients in their infinite
wisdom created a programme

16:05.053 --> 16:06.750
that can sniff out artificial patterns.

16:06.977 --> 16:10.116
Now, t's no doubt a long-range means
of detecting advanced life forms...

16:10.196 --> 16:12.554
kind of like our SETI programme,
only much more powerful

16:12.644 --> 16:15.775
`cause it operates through sub-space.
Anyway, it's... it picked up this.

16:19.949 --> 16:20.637
What is it?

16:20.777 --> 16:23.373
That's Sheppard. I don't know why
he didn't send a regular message

16:23.462 --> 16:26.449
but maybe he was dealing with a damaged
transmitter, or maybe to communicate

16:26.538 --> 16:28.507
without being detected, but
it's definitely him.

16:28.587 --> 16:29.831
How d'you know it's him?

16:30.369 --> 16:32.333
It's Morse code. SOS.

16:39.605 --> 16:40.837
What's happening?

16:43.875 --> 16:45.024
What was that for?

16:45.104 --> 16:46.798
D'you realise what you've done?

16:47.161 --> 16:48.268
I didn't do anything.

16:52.490 --> 16:55.762
- Stop that!
- I'll stop when you stop lying.

16:56.084 --> 16:59.965
You adapted the damaged communications
array to send out a signal, didn't you?

17:02.599 --> 17:03.599
Yes.

17:06.821 --> 17:09.713
You said you'd stop that!

17:09.858 --> 17:12.044
You were right.
Maybe I'll just shoot you.

17:13.816 --> 17:17.263
All right, don't you think
you're over-reacting a little?

17:17.344 --> 17:19.172
You were trying
to broadcast our location.

17:19.387 --> 17:20.584
Guess what? It worked.

17:20.703 --> 17:23.940
There's a ship approaching, only I don't
think it's the one you were hoping for.

17:24.545 --> 17:25.580
What do you mean?

17:25.806 --> 17:27.101
It's the Wraith!

17:44.928 --> 17:47.649
- The Wraith ship is firing on us.
- Do we have shields?

17:48.174 --> 17:51.720
Affirmative... but they're only at 20%.
We can't take this for very long.

17:57.748 --> 18:00.426
If you're gonna get out of this alive,
you're gonna need my help.

18:01.216 --> 18:02.471
Now I realise

18:03.491 --> 18:06.223
you and I don't exactly
trust each other...

18:07.105 --> 18:08.107
but...

18:09.157 --> 18:10.780
it's not gonna make much difference

18:10.870 --> 18:13.261
if the Wraith blow the ship up, is it?

18:15.719 --> 18:16.908
What've you got in mind?

18:17.010 --> 18:19.583
Well, you could start by shooting back.

18:22.346 --> 18:23.293
Right.

18:27.336 --> 18:30.576
The weapons control platform is down the
corridor. I'm headed back to the bridge.

18:30.656 --> 18:32.335
Keep the shields up as long as you can.

18:46.647 --> 18:47.647
Great!

18:53.584 --> 18:54.603
Piece of cake.

18:57.365 --> 18:58.664
Shields are down.

18:58.806 --> 19:00.853
Can't you re-route any more power?

19:02.806 --> 19:04.270
There's nothing I can do.

19:26.971 --> 19:28.935
Silas, Nevik, what happened?

19:30.829 --> 19:31.990
Do you read me?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.883
<i>- It's Sheppard.</i>
- I didn't give you a communicator.

20:02.153 --> 20:04.099
I activated the ship's intercom.
What happened?

20:04.253 --> 20:06.953
I don't know.
The forward section has been sealed off.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.426
<i>What about your people?</i>

20:09.384 --> 20:10.884
They're not responding.

20:11.375 --> 20:14.589
The good news is
the Wraith ship's been destroyed.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.188
Stay where you are. I'm coming to you.

20:33.850 --> 20:35.336
<i>Sheppard, where are you?</i>

20:35.416 --> 20:36.832
Auxiliary control room.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.606
I'm sorry about this.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.545
<i>What are you doing?</i>

20:49.222 --> 20:50.794
For the moment, not much.

20:51.783 --> 20:53.743
Hyperdrive seems to be offline.

20:53.925 --> 20:54.800
<i>What?</i>

20:55.733 --> 20:56.966
How bad is it?

20:57.142 --> 21:00.170
<i>Well, it's not exactly
my area of expertise</i>

21:00.961 --> 21:02.901
but if I'm reading this thing right,

21:03.513 --> 21:06.550
the drive itself is undamaged. Probably
just a short in the control system.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.896
Then we can take care of it
through a simple bypass.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.916
Just let me out
and I should be able to fix it.

21:11.573 --> 21:14.826
- I don't think so.
- We're a floating target out here!

21:15.320 --> 21:16.728
All right, take it easy.

21:17.408 --> 21:20.563
I've got the transmitter off. My people
should have gotten the message by now.

21:20.643 --> 21:24.427
<i>There is no reason to assume that Wraith
ship didn't broadcast our position.</i>

21:24.507 --> 21:26.520
Well, there's no reason
to assume they did.

21:26.674 --> 21:27.863
Listen to me, Sheppard.

21:27.943 --> 21:30.374
I've spent my entire life
around hyperdrive systems.

21:30.454 --> 21:33.383
- I know what I'm doing.
- I never said I didn't believe you.

21:34.054 --> 21:35.210
Don't worry...

21:36.112 --> 21:37.623
my people will be here.

21:52.801 --> 21:55.919
Sheppard was broadcasting from somewhere
in the vicinity of this system.

21:57.618 --> 21:59.544
Well,
sensors aren't picking up anything.

21:59.650 --> 22:01.806
Let me see if I can expand
the range a little.

22:04.909 --> 22:05.929
There.

22:06.257 --> 22:07.293
What is it?

22:07.740 --> 22:09.141
It could be a ship.

22:09.816 --> 22:12.283
It's still too far to get any details
but that's gotta be them.

22:12.363 --> 22:14.239
How long to get there
at maximum sub-light?

22:14.319 --> 22:15.821
It's five hours.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.400
This is Lorne to all Jumpers.
I'm sending you some coordinates.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.317
Proceed to target at maximum sub-light.

22:21.397 --> 22:22.397
Go ahead.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.319
Larrin,

22:36.447 --> 22:37.619
what are you doing?

22:38.509 --> 22:39.517
<i>Look,</i>

22:39.830 --> 22:42.795
<i>once my people get here
and get the hyperdrive back online,</i>

22:42.875 --> 22:45.250
<i>we'll drop you off at the nearest Gate.
You have my word.</i>

22:46.182 --> 22:47.190
Not good enough.

22:47.788 --> 22:49.388
What, my word or my deal?

22:49.822 --> 22:51.022
Yeah, well, both.

22:52.295 --> 22:54.295
You're the one
who kidnapped me, remember?

22:54.486 --> 22:55.700
Because I need the ship.

23:00.378 --> 23:01.383
<i>There.</i>

23:01.506 --> 23:02.670
<i>I did you a favour.</i>

23:05.637 --> 23:06.715
Sheppard,

23:08.294 --> 23:09.304
listen to me.

23:09.904 --> 23:11.815
Our fleet is old.

23:12.032 --> 23:14.482
<i>There was a time when we had
the resources to build new ships,</i>

23:14.562 --> 23:15.580
<i>but now we don't.</i>

23:15.805 --> 23:18.235
<i>When we lose one, it's gone for good,</i>

23:19.456 --> 23:21.411
<i>and despite strict population controls</i>

23:21.579 --> 23:24.319
there just isn't enough room
for all of us any more.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.932
We've been forced to abandon
some of our own people on the ground.

23:30.732 --> 23:33.967
Well, they're no worse off than the rest
of the people in this galaxy.

23:35.566 --> 23:36.577
Fine.

23:39.439 --> 23:40.950
We'll do this the hard way.

23:46.102 --> 23:47.599
Larrin, what are you doing?

24:02.112 --> 24:04.616
Sheppard, you are really
starting to annoy me!

24:05.064 --> 24:07.372
Just sit tight.
It'll be over soon enough.

24:09.265 --> 24:10.554
Silas, Nevik, come in?

24:11.818 --> 24:13.344
Silas, do you read me?

24:13.572 --> 24:15.943
<i>- Give it up. They're gone.</i>
- You don't know that.

24:16.142 --> 24:17.727
No, but I can find out.

24:29.659 --> 24:31.985
Looks like there's no-one alive
in the forward section.

24:33.260 --> 24:34.267
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

24:39.024 --> 24:40.979
Larrin, where are you going?

24:43.844 --> 24:46.513
I can track you anywhere on the ship.
You can't hide from me.

24:56.316 --> 24:58.810
I'm picking up another life sign
directly in front of you.

24:59.144 --> 25:00.155
Silas!

25:01.138 --> 25:03.982
That's impossible. There's no way
he got out of that section alive.

25:42.789 --> 25:43.789
You all right?

25:44.347 --> 25:45.347
I'm fine.

25:45.649 --> 25:47.070
It just caught me off guard.

25:47.394 --> 25:50.409
They must have escaped in the Darts
before their ship was destroyed.

25:51.355 --> 25:54.284
We left the hangar bay pressurised,
they flew right in.

25:54.504 --> 25:56.297
- They?
- Yeah, there's three more.

25:56.947 --> 25:58.317
We can track `em with this.

25:58.514 --> 25:59.774
Where'd you get that?

25:59.854 --> 26:01.240
Auxiliary control room.

26:01.372 --> 26:03.061
Gotta know where to look. Come on.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.125
Get his weapon.

26:12.352 --> 26:14.441
Tenacious little bastards, aren't they?

26:16.479 --> 26:18.182
Don't suppose you have
any more of these?

26:18.581 --> 26:19.721
I'm afraid not.

26:20.297 --> 26:22.430
And I don't think
this is gonna be much good either.

26:32.899 --> 26:33.899
Hold on!

26:34.542 --> 26:35.994
Got one coming this way.

26:43.459 --> 26:44.459
What now?

26:58.352 --> 27:00.989
Wait, no, Sheppard...
What? What are you doing?

27:01.986 --> 27:05.121
What? Oh, I can't believe
you're playing this...

27:32.980 --> 27:34.540
There's the other two.

27:35.568 --> 27:37.336
What, are they having a board meeting?

27:45.834 --> 27:49.373
No use. I've done everything to boost
the sensors. It's still too far out.

27:49.453 --> 27:51.186
So we have no idea
what we're dealing with?

27:51.274 --> 27:53.455
Why so far out
on the edge of the solar system?

27:53.535 --> 27:55.574
Don't think it's a coincidence
there's a space Gate.

27:55.654 --> 27:57.066
They were probably headed for it

27:57.146 --> 27:59.358
- when they dropped out of hyperspace.
- Why would they?

27:59.438 --> 28:01.389
How should I know?
We don't know who they are.

28:01.692 --> 28:03.222
Does it make a difference?

28:04.475 --> 28:06.583
Even if it was a fleet of hive ships,

28:06.669 --> 28:09.003
would it stop us
from trying to get him back?

28:12.345 --> 28:13.345
No.

28:14.247 --> 28:17.240
You know, none of this'd have happened
if you would have just cooperated.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.927
You'd be home by now,
and I'd be headed back to my people

28:20.063 --> 28:22.608
with a ship that could house
a thousand men, women, and children.

28:22.690 --> 28:26.036
If you had asked for my help in the
first place instead of attacking me...

28:26.116 --> 28:28.236
- We couldn't risk it.
- Risk what?

28:29.969 --> 28:31.207
You might have said no.

28:38.004 --> 28:39.197
They're leaving.

28:51.082 --> 28:52.448
Hold up.

28:52.886 --> 28:54.259
We got a problem.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.684
They're between us and the control room.

28:57.766 --> 28:59.300
Should be able to find a way around.

28:59.380 --> 29:01.768
There isn't enough time.
We can't risk them finding it first.

29:01.854 --> 29:04.384
What does it matter?
It's not like they can fly the ship.

29:05.833 --> 29:06.833
Sheppard...

29:07.770 --> 29:10.146
you did shut down the controls, right?

29:11.068 --> 29:12.961
- Sheppard...
- There wasn't enough time.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.137
If they find that control room
before we do,

29:15.217 --> 29:17.096
they'll not only be able
to fly the ship,

29:17.182 --> 29:19.889
but they're going to be able to track us
using the internal sensors.

29:19.971 --> 29:22.583
Believe me, I know, and by the way,

29:22.667 --> 29:25.202
I was busy saving your life at the time.

29:25.445 --> 29:28.740
The only reason my life
was in danger in the first place

29:28.820 --> 29:32.079
is because you decided to broadcast
our position to half the galaxy.

29:34.755 --> 29:37.657
Do you want to argue about this,
or do you want to do something about it?

29:37.740 --> 29:38.765
Fine.

29:39.095 --> 29:40.586
What are the options?

29:41.460 --> 29:44.025
Well, we're cut off
from the control room,

29:44.192 --> 29:45.584
and we have no weapons.

29:45.674 --> 29:47.406
That's not true. We have the chair.

29:47.836 --> 29:50.547
I don't think drones are going to do
any good with a bunch of Wraith

29:50.628 --> 29:51.942
in the middle of the ship.

29:52.924 --> 29:54.533
What if they weren't in the middle?

29:56.324 --> 29:57.453
Get serious.

29:57.763 --> 29:58.987
You got a better idea?

30:06.815 --> 30:07.897
All right.

30:08.526 --> 30:09.631
I'm in position.

30:11.461 --> 30:12.695
Wait for my signal.

30:12.775 --> 30:14.576
<i>You sure you want to go
through with this?</i>

30:14.758 --> 30:16.283
I mean, if you don't make it,

30:16.765 --> 30:18.964
I'm going to feel responsible, and,

30:19.273 --> 30:21.037
well, I really don't need the guilt.

30:21.127 --> 30:23.629
I'll be fine as long as
you don't shoot too early.

30:23.877 --> 30:26.446
I'm sure it's not the first time
you've heard that from a woman.

30:26.526 --> 30:29.067
On the other hand,
I might be able to live with it.

30:34.025 --> 30:35.025
I got 'em.

30:36.528 --> 30:37.534
Here we go.

31:05.696 --> 31:06.810
Sheppard, now!

31:42.116 --> 31:43.430
Larrin, come in.

31:47.556 --> 31:48.735
Larrin?

32:00.002 --> 32:01.109
And now,

32:01.587 --> 32:03.789
before I take the rest of your life,

32:04.015 --> 32:05.814
you will answer my questions.

32:06.715 --> 32:09.455
How many more of your people
are on this ship?

32:10.677 --> 32:12.225
<i>I do not have to kill you,</i>

32:12.453 --> 32:14.373
<i>nor do I have to leave you like this.</i>

32:14.576 --> 32:17.092
<i>It would be better if you cooperated.</i>

32:17.285 --> 32:19.268
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

32:19.952 --> 32:21.103
Tell me,

32:22.318 --> 32:24.245
how many more of you

32:24.575 --> 32:25.809
<i>are onboard?</i>

32:30.809 --> 32:32.061
It only takes one.

32:35.057 --> 32:36.581
I see that you've just fed,

32:37.171 --> 32:40.304
which means that your regeneration
powers are at their highest,

32:41.109 --> 32:42.123
but...

32:42.376 --> 32:44.762
I seriously doubt
you can grow a new head.

32:46.593 --> 32:47.642
What do you want?

32:47.808 --> 32:48.808
First,

32:49.135 --> 32:50.697
you're going to hand me the stunner.

32:51.107 --> 32:52.108
Slowly.

32:59.831 --> 33:00.831
<i>Next,</i>

33:01.490 --> 33:03.457
you're going to get back what you took.

33:03.897 --> 33:05.377
Then, you're going to leave.

33:06.361 --> 33:08.442
- Leave?
- You came in a dart, right?

33:08.545 --> 33:09.853
The bay was unguarded.

33:10.086 --> 33:12.832
We landed our darts
and entered unchallenged.

33:12.932 --> 33:15.188
Well, then, you're going to leave
the same way you came.

33:15.331 --> 33:18.075
There's a space Gate orbiting
the second planet in this system.

33:18.159 --> 33:20.220
It may take you a while,
but you'll get there.

33:21.621 --> 33:22.852
If I restore her,

33:23.143 --> 33:25.673
<i>there's nothing to stop you
from going back on your word</i>

33:25.784 --> 33:27.181
and killing me anyway.

33:28.454 --> 33:29.454
That's true.

33:29.895 --> 33:32.868
I'd say there's a 50-50 chance
i'll do it out of pure spite,

33:33.070 --> 33:34.077
but...

33:34.681 --> 33:35.684
if you don't,

33:36.848 --> 33:37.869
I will kill you.

34:09.583 --> 34:10.627
Get up.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.081
Turn around.

34:28.610 --> 34:29.612
You all right?

34:29.706 --> 34:30.706
I don't know.

34:31.726 --> 34:33.821
That was so strange.

34:34.708 --> 34:35.909
To have your...

34:36.926 --> 34:38.900
whole life fading away, and then to...

34:39.426 --> 34:40.819
suddenly have it back again.

34:43.143 --> 34:45.063
It actually felt kind of good.

34:45.722 --> 34:46.724
I know.

34:46.806 --> 34:48.214
Happened to me once, too.

34:48.693 --> 34:49.866
Long story.

34:50.190 --> 34:51.558
Think you can get up?

34:52.083 --> 34:53.083
Yeah.

34:58.900 --> 34:59.911
Easy...

35:00.518 --> 35:02.064
I'm okay. I'm all right.

35:03.959 --> 35:05.239
You saved my life.

35:06.734 --> 35:07.712
Again.

35:09.806 --> 35:12.560
If you hadn't come up with the plan,
we'd both be dead.

35:12.833 --> 35:14.719
So are you saying we make a good team?

35:15.573 --> 35:17.280
Well, don't go crazy.

35:17.983 --> 35:18.990
Right,

35:20.835 --> 35:22.697
but in the interest of...

35:23.915 --> 35:25.605
interstellar relations,

35:26.782 --> 35:28.812
I think we should at least just...

35:29.403 --> 35:30.683
try to get along,

35:31.874 --> 35:32.880
right?

35:43.999 --> 35:45.808
You've got to be kidding me.

35:46.407 --> 35:47.335
Sorry.

36:22.544 --> 36:23.544
Larrin...

36:24.108 --> 36:25.679
Sorry about this, Sheppard,

36:26.376 --> 36:28.585
and I really am grateful
you saved my life.

36:29.254 --> 36:31.505
Well, you've got
a funny way of showing it.

36:31.585 --> 36:33.111
<i>Don't play hurt with me.</i>

36:33.411 --> 36:36.005
<i>It's easy to be generous when
you think you have the upper hand.</i>

36:36.085 --> 36:37.477
What are you talking about?

36:37.557 --> 36:40.148
We both know the only reason
you didn't stun me and lock me up

36:40.228 --> 36:42.385
the first opportunity you got
was because you thought

36:42.465 --> 36:44.790
your ships were going to get here first.

36:46.147 --> 36:48.271
You were wrong about that, by the way.

37:01.510 --> 37:02.879
<i>It's good to see you again.</i>

37:03.310 --> 37:04.317
Believe me,

37:04.581 --> 37:06.726
I feel the same way.
How did you find us?

37:07.492 --> 37:10.839
<i>Well, we were monitoring communications
before you jumped into hyperspace.</i>

37:11.720 --> 37:13.264
You knew he took the ship?

37:13.776 --> 37:15.762
<i>It seemed fairly obvious.</i>

37:15.877 --> 37:18.479
<i>We guessed his priority would be
to contact his people,</i>

37:18.559 --> 37:20.676
<i>so we sent probes to all the space Gates</i>

37:20.756 --> 37:22.639
<i>in the vicinity
of our previous position.</i>

37:22.928 --> 37:25.350
<i>Eventually,
we detected your energy signature.</i>

37:26.405 --> 37:27.411
Well done.

37:27.728 --> 37:29.890
Now, I want you to send over
a couple of technicians

37:29.970 --> 37:31.887
to help me get
the hyperdrive back online.

37:33.915 --> 37:36.152
And a security team as well.

37:36.644 --> 37:37.650
<i>Right away.</i>

37:49.052 --> 37:50.058
Oh, come on.

37:58.566 --> 38:01.186
All right, close enough to do
a full sensor sweep.

38:03.340 --> 38:05.044
Looks like we got four ships,

38:05.603 --> 38:07.746
one of them Lantian design.
Aurora class.

38:08.016 --> 38:10.584
- What about the other 3?
- I don't recognize the configurations.

38:10.664 --> 38:13.030
- What about Sheppard?
- The logical assumption is that

38:13.110 --> 38:15.208
he's onboard the ship
that transmitted the signal.

38:15.288 --> 38:17.902
- And which one is that?
- Well, I have no idea.

38:17.993 --> 38:21.028
We're about to enter weapons range, Doc.
Which ships do I target?

38:21.119 --> 38:23.825
Perhaps we should attempt
to communicate before we attack.

38:23.915 --> 38:26.294
- We know nothing about these people.
- <i>That's true,</i>

38:26.483 --> 38:28.722
but right now, about the only thing
we got working for us

38:28.806 --> 38:31.716
is the fact that we're cloaked. We send
a signal, we give up our position.

38:31.844 --> 38:33.928
He's right. They could target us,
or for that matter,

38:34.008 --> 38:36.783
they could jump back into hyperspace.
We'd be right back at square one.

38:36.863 --> 38:38.847
We didn't come all
this way for nothing, right?

38:41.347 --> 38:44.304
All right, well, I'll see if
I can figure out a way to disable them.

38:51.562 --> 38:54.647
I thought you'd be glad to know the
hyperdrive repairs are almost complete.

38:54.851 --> 38:56.384
Well, congratulations.

38:56.919 --> 38:58.109
You got what you want.

38:59.245 --> 39:01.637
Yes, it's true I can fly
the ship and navigate,

39:01.718 --> 39:04.960
but there are still dozens of systems
I don't have access to,

39:05.040 --> 39:08.036
and if any of the controls went down,
it would be a problem.

39:08.202 --> 39:09.525
So finish the adapter.

39:10.082 --> 39:13.374
You've said you can reverse-engineer the
systems that were already initialized.

39:13.465 --> 39:15.263
Well, yes, we can, eventually,

39:15.792 --> 39:18.296
but it would go a lot faster
if I keep you onboard.

39:18.627 --> 39:20.863
You are a piece of work, you know that?

39:20.945 --> 39:22.686
I know you don't agree with my tactics,

39:22.767 --> 39:25.090
but I wasn't lying about
why I need this ship.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.144
I'm doing this for my people.

39:30.187 --> 39:31.080
Look...

39:31.277 --> 39:34.312
I know you think you're helping
your people, but you're wrong.

39:36.364 --> 39:37.369
Excuse me?

39:37.450 --> 39:39.680
You've been running
and hiding for thousands of years.

39:39.761 --> 39:41.152
You've survived, good for you,

39:41.933 --> 39:42.937
but now

39:43.019 --> 39:45.179
you're starting to see
diminishing returns.

39:45.454 --> 39:48.121
One more ship, that will buy you
a little more time, but ultimately,

39:48.201 --> 39:49.708
it's not going to change anything.

39:50.169 --> 39:53.164
Your people are headed for a slow death.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.168
What other choice do we have?

39:57.592 --> 39:59.154
In case you haven't heard,

39:59.603 --> 40:01.820
you will soon enough,
but the Wraith are under attack.

40:01.902 --> 40:02.906
From who?

40:03.109 --> 40:06.077
It's a long story, but the point is,
they're taking heavy damage,

40:06.158 --> 40:08.789
and if they don't get wiped out,
they're going to be vulnerable.

40:08.870 --> 40:11.751
You people have hyperdrives
and advanced weapons,

40:12.384 --> 40:13.603
and God knows what else.

40:13.816 --> 40:15.158
When the time is right,

40:15.644 --> 40:18.229
that kind of technology
can tip the balance.

40:21.277 --> 40:23.152
Are you suggesting an alliance?

40:23.321 --> 40:26.883
Well, I'm not asking you to dinner,
but yeah, something like that.

40:27.695 --> 40:29.257
After all I put you through?

40:29.632 --> 40:31.903
Well, like you said,
you did it for your people.

40:33.778 --> 40:35.772
I may have misjudged you after all.

40:39.448 --> 40:41.942
All right, Doc, we're in weapons range.
What do you got for me?

40:42.022 --> 40:44.076
We can target
the Lantian ship's engines.

40:44.282 --> 40:45.469
What about the others?

40:45.553 --> 40:48.027
I've been going over the data,
but there's too many unknowns.

40:48.107 --> 40:50.765
If we hit them in the wrong spot,
we could blow them out of the sky,

40:50.854 --> 40:53.493
or the drones could just bounce
harmlessly off the shields.

40:53.647 --> 40:56.920
All right, well, it's still our best
option. We can't risk them getting away.

41:09.698 --> 41:10.698
They're gone.

41:21.296 --> 41:22.496
I'm getting a contact.

41:24.274 --> 41:25.372
It's a Jumper.

41:25.641 --> 41:26.672
One life sign.

41:27.232 --> 41:29.753
Colonel Sheppard, this is
major Lorne. Is that you?

41:29.833 --> 41:31.638
<i>That's affirmative, Major.</i>

41:32.756 --> 41:34.175
It's good to hear from you.

41:34.543 --> 41:35.710
<i>Likewise, Sir.</i>

41:36.092 --> 41:38.294
<i>Seemed like we came pretty close
to losing you there.</i>

41:41.015 --> 41:42.502
You don't know the half of it.

41:54.441 --> 41:55.996
- That's good!
- Really.

41:57.281 --> 41:59.198
Spend enough time
with a bunch of space nomads,

41:59.278 --> 42:01.557
you really begin
to appreciate what you have.

42:01.762 --> 42:05.295
It's difficult to imagine spending
one's entire life on board a ship.

42:05.722 --> 42:07.068
If that was me, I'd go crazy.

42:07.148 --> 42:09.039
<i>They're not 
the most even-keeled people.</i>

42:09.119 --> 42:10.985
<i>I'm still not exactly sure
why they let me go.</i>

42:11.065 --> 42:13.864
Well, you did offer them an alliance.
That has to be worth something.

42:13.982 --> 42:16.349
Or they figured out you'd be
more trouble than you're worth.

42:17.514 --> 42:19.238
That is a possibility.

42:19.512 --> 42:21.405
No, there's something
you're not telling us.

42:22.689 --> 42:24.041
She was hot, wasn't she?

42:24.396 --> 42:26.052
I don't know what you're talking about.

42:26.208 --> 42:27.925
I knew it! That is so typical!

42:28.331 --> 42:29.886
She had me beat, Rodney.

42:30.697 --> 42:32.615
<i>She threatened to kill me several times.</i>

42:32.754 --> 42:34.914
It wasn't like we were hanging out
in the spa together.

42:35.017 --> 42:38.076
Whatever! All I know is that every time
I get taken captive, it's the Wraith.

42:38.211 --> 42:41.977
Just once, I would like
to be taken prisoner by the sexy alien.

42:42.670 --> 42:45.188
- Well, you may still get a chance.
- Yeah? What do you mean?

42:45.644 --> 42:47.132
She's still out there.
