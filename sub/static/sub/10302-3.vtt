02:07.360 --> 02:11.353
I am fed out to here
with stupid people.

02:12.160 --> 02:15.675
A customer comes into the diner and
he asked for the Norwegian salmon.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.438
Then he wants to know
if it's fresh.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.074
I said, " Hey, chucklehead,
this is Chicago.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.033
This is not Norwegia, okay?

02:23.840 --> 02:27.355
Nothing is fresh."
Well, I shouldn't say nothing.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.798
- Speaking of nothing, where's Bud?
- Well, it's fall.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.991
So you know another school year
is beginning.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.238
Which means your brother is upstairs
trying on another persona...

02:44.440 --> 02:46.192
...in hopes of attracting a girl.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.757
He has as much chance
of finding a date...

02:48.960 --> 02:52.157
...as the cast of Roc does
getting served at Denny's.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.475
I can't wait to see what kind
of Prince Charming...

02:56.680 --> 02:59.513
...the little frog is gonna try
to mutate into this year.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.716
Let me guess: Billy Ray Bundy.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.910
Damn straight, missy.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.755
Country is in.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.835
Well, then what country are you?

03:29.600 --> 03:32.672
I'm going to ignore that,
human peepshow.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.476
Because this will work.

03:35.680 --> 03:38.240
Now, I've chewed my weight
in Red Man.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.032
I've learned my country sayings...

03:40.240 --> 03:43.994
...like "ornery"
and "I thought you was 18."

03:44.880 --> 03:48.839
So as I live and barely breathe
in these jeans...

03:49.040 --> 03:51.873
...l'll be riding
the country charts tonight.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.277
Well, I admit,
it's better than last year.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.550
Remember, he bought that wig,
gained 30 pounds...

04:03.760 --> 04:06.479
...and called himself
Joey Bud-afuoco?

04:17.120 --> 04:18.553
Peg, I must be hallucinating.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.673
I could have swore
that Yosemite Sam just passed me.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.308
- That was Bud.
- Then it must be fall.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.909
Well, as you know,
I've had a wee peck of trouble...

04:30.120 --> 04:32.156
...finding a alternator for my Dodge.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.239
Yes, and a deodorant
that your body won't reject.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.469
And a wife that my body won't reject.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.752
Anyway, after painstaking research
to find this part...

04:43.960 --> 04:46.599
...a bum told me to call
Irv's World of Junk...

04:46.800 --> 04:48.438
...in Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.791
So you know what this means?
Means I'm gonna get my part.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.278
All I gotta do is call 800-head-on.

05:00.360 --> 05:04.319
- Welcome to Irv's World of Junk.
- Hey, Irv, it's Al Bundy here. I'd...

05:04.520 --> 05:07.512
If you'd lik e these instructions
in Spanish...

05:07.720 --> 05:10.837
...press 1. For French, press 2.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.110
Don't you love these things?

05:13.360 --> 05:16.318
For Cajun, press 4.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.678
And for English, press 5.

05:21.480 --> 05:25.359
You have pressed 5.
You speak English.

05:26.800 --> 05:30.156
If your car is Swedish, press 1.

05:31.320 --> 05:34.517
If your car is Japanese, press 2.

05:34.760 --> 05:38.309
If your car is Japanese,
but made in America...

05:39.800 --> 05:44.555
...in a patronizing attempt to pretend
we have a viable automobile industry...

05:44.800 --> 05:46.677
...press 3.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.671
What are the odds of running into
a Native-American-pride parade...

05:57.880 --> 06:00.553
...marching half a block
from our house?

06:01.120 --> 06:02.997
Bud, you're going about this
all wrong.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.959
Now, you keep trying to change
the clothes that you wear...

06:06.200 --> 06:08.270
...but what you really need
is a new head...

06:08.480 --> 06:11.677
...and while you're at it,
a new body to put it on.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.395
No. Thanks for caring,
but this is it for me.

06:15.600 --> 06:19.229
I will neither seek nor accept a date
from any woman for the rest of my life.

06:19.440 --> 06:22.477
Instead, I shall live out the rest
of my days in the basement...

06:22.680 --> 06:25.069
...as the gnome
you've always said that I was.

06:26.040 --> 06:27.712
Goodbye forever.

06:33.600 --> 06:35.716
Gee, I feel kind of bad.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.070
Well, honey,
you were pretty hard on him.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.599
No, I'm fine with that...

06:39.800 --> 06:42.997
...but I think I should have told him
there's no third step.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.112
Oh, well, one less plate for lunch.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.239
- AI, Bud is really upset.
- Bud's upset? Listen to this.

06:55.440 --> 06:59.353
If your car is a Pacer, press 61.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.798
If your car is a Studebak er, press 62.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.117
Honey, he said that he is never
dating again...

07:07.320 --> 07:09.356
...and wants to live in the basement
forever.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.838
Sounds like a good plan.
Wished I'd thought of it.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.789
If your car is a Hudson Hornet,
press 67.

07:18.160 --> 07:22.199
Well, I guess it's time
to hang this outfit with the others.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.470
Buderace.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.520
Thanks a lot for puberty!

07:51.520 --> 07:53.829
I'm staying down here forever!

07:54.040 --> 07:56.554
You hear that, family?

07:56.760 --> 07:59.228
No, don't all come down
at once now.

08:06.880 --> 08:10.270
If you build it, he will come.

08:13.040 --> 08:14.837
That you, Kel?

08:15.040 --> 08:17.952
Mom? Dad?

08:18.160 --> 08:19.991
Buck?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.952
Oh, God.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.311
Is this how that rainbow-wig guy
got started?

08:29.440 --> 08:32.830
If you build it, he will come.

08:34.440 --> 08:38.399
If your car has zero
to 10, 000 miles...

08:42.720 --> 08:43.948
...press 1.

08:44.159 --> 08:47.152
Ten to 20, 000 miles, press 2.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.234
- Bud?
- Yeah, Ma?

08:54.440 --> 08:57.591
- What are you doing?
- Building.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.917
- What are you building?
- I don't know.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.910
- So why are you doing it?
- So he'll come.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.669
- So who'll come, dear?
- Him.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.869
I think we should call Janet Reno.
She'll know what to do.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.996
It's gonna be so wonderful, Mom.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.034
Once he gets here, everything's
gonna be much, much better.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.469
Well, honey, if you need anything,
you just let me know, okay?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.950
Move, Kel. Back up the stairs.
Back up the stairs.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.677
If your Dodge has between 100, 000
and 200, 000 miles...

09:53.880 --> 09:55.711
...press 11.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.229
Two hundred to 300, 000...

09:58.440 --> 10:00.317
...press 12.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.194
This is all my fault.

10:05.440 --> 10:09.479
I knew when he was a baby, I should
have gotten him a proper sitter.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.595
But, you know, Buck was right there
and the price was right.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.837
Yeah, well, I'm at fault too.
When you said push him to the park...

10:19.040 --> 10:21.270
...I probably should have put him
in the stroller.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.155
And, you know, I shouldn't have given
him PEZ and said they were vitamins.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.797
Well, I bet girls would have
dated him...

10:29.000 --> 10:32.117
...if I hadn't told everybody in school
that he only had one buttock.

10:33.480 --> 10:36.233
Well, look, don't worry, honey.
One thing is perfectly clear.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.510
Bud's problems
are all your father's fault.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.631
Al, you gotta do something
about the boy.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.637
Wait a second, Peg,
I've gone this far.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.116
In just a few more minutes
I'm gonna have my alternator now.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.955
If your Dodge is still on the road,
press 1.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.989
If your Dodge is on blocks, press 2.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.240
If your Dodge is on fire...

11:01.200 --> 11:02.713
...press 3.

11:09.440 --> 11:13.672
Bud, it's 1:00.
Do you wanna come to bed?

11:13.880 --> 11:17.031
Thanks, Mom.
I'm on a tight schedule here.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.638
I see.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.714
Well, honey, your father and I
just want you to know...

11:22.920 --> 11:27.038
...that we love you and we'll always
be there to protect you from harm.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.798
Thanks, Mom.

11:50.200 --> 11:51.872
Well...

11:52.080 --> 11:53.308
...I finally finished.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.912
It's done.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.951
What is it?

12:14.480 --> 12:15.879
It's me.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.873
No, it's not you.

12:20.480 --> 12:22.198
Let's chat, shall we?

12:28.200 --> 12:32.113
Well, what do you mean you're not me?
I mean, you look just like me.

12:32.320 --> 12:36.757
Hey, don't insult me, all right?
I'm not you.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.639
Well, actually, I'm part of you.

12:39.840 --> 12:42.434
I'm the part of you that's cool.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.756
Well, you're the rest.

12:45.480 --> 12:50.600
- Well, why are you here?
- Because I can't stand it anymore.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.236
I mean, every year you trot me off
to the ladies, full of hopes...

12:54.440 --> 12:57.238
...and every year we come back
with your tail between my legs.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.994
I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life...

13:01.200 --> 13:02.872
...down here in this basement.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.796
So I'm here to teach you to be cool.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.916
Mommy!

13:09.640 --> 13:12.313
Oh, this is gonna be easy.

13:13.080 --> 13:17.392
If you are having trouble with our
automated-telephone system...

13:23.040 --> 13:26.316
...and would lik e a live operator
to assist you...

13:26.520 --> 13:28.397
...press 0 now.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.195
If not,
this recording will begin again.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.910
Welcome to Irv's World of Junk.

13:42.880 --> 13:46.395
Peggy, it's 2:00 in the morning.

13:52.400 --> 13:56.188
I know, but this is an emergency.
I really don't know what to do.

13:56.440 --> 14:00.035
- I think Bud has lost his mind.
- Well, Peggy, don't worry.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.038
I'm sure all Bud needs
is a man to talk to.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.313
Where can we find one?

14:07.520 --> 14:10.717
Where can we find one?
Al, have you seen a man?

14:10.920 --> 14:13.957
No, but I've seen a woman
who can make one sterile.

14:17.880 --> 14:20.348
Look, Peggy,
maybe you're overreacting.

14:20.560 --> 14:23.711
You know, he's right. Maybe Bud's
just going through a normal phase.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.632
Don't talk to me that way,
Bud Bundy.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.075
Who you calling Bud Bundy?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.709
Maybe you should just seal him up now
and cut your losses.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.638
Jefferson,
go down and talk to the boy.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.479
Why me? Why can't Al do it?

14:37.680 --> 14:41.434
If your car is a Pacer, press 61.

14:43.160 --> 14:46.152
If your car is a Studebak er, press 62.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.472
Well, how about Kelly?

14:51.680 --> 14:53.557
She's working the late shift
at the diner.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.115
- It's up to you, Jefferson.
- But, Marcie, he's nuts.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.958
And he could be dangerous.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.994
You go down there. You're the one with
the million-dollar life insurance policy.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.749
What million-dollar
life insurance policy?

15:09.120 --> 15:12.032
We'll talk later.
I gotta go help out the boy.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.192
Hi there, Bud.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.873
Hey, your mo...

15:24.080 --> 15:28.312
Your mother says there's a little
something that's bothering you.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.239
How about talking to old Jefferson
about it?

15:32.360 --> 15:34.396
He thinks I'm not cool.

15:40.320 --> 15:43.039
Well, we can't have that.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.879
Now, see here, Mr. Horsy.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.393
Bud Bundy is a friend of mine.

15:48.600 --> 15:51.831
You be nice to him
or there'll be no oats for you.

15:52.360 --> 15:56.069
"Please give me oats, Mr. D'Arcy.

15:56.800 --> 16:01.920
I won't be mean to Bud anymore."

16:04.720 --> 16:06.392
There, Bud.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.477
I've taken care of it.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.395
You know what I used to do
when I was your age...

16:11.600 --> 16:13.750
...and I was feeling down
and out like this?

16:14.600 --> 16:16.636
I'd get me a woman.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.917
And we'd do it like animals
in the car.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.156
It always made me feel better.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.436
You should try it, Bud.

16:30.000 --> 16:32.673
Here. It's on me.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.230
Just make sure it stays on you.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.558
- What a moron.
- What a moron.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.512
Okay, back to cool school.

16:57.720 --> 17:01.315
What you need to change
isn't your looks, it's your approach.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.912
Now, you listen, me.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.509
Now, sure I've made a few mistakes
with the babes...

17:06.720 --> 17:08.597
...but I've also had my share
of successes.

17:08.800 --> 17:13.476
Well, then, let's just look at some
of these successes, shall we?

17:13.680 --> 17:15.750
Roll the tape.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.916
Need some help?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.552
One good turn deserves another.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.114
I saw this movie where
this mannequin came to life...

17:35.320 --> 17:38.392
...so if you can talk, please do.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.637
Bud.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.679
Oh, my God.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.916
You know my name.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.030
Do you also know what I lik e?

17:52.040 --> 17:54.634
Reginald Bundy, critic for The Times.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.673
You know, I get so few chances
to see films with the public.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.678
This time I wanna watch a film
exactly as the people do.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.474
So, if you don't mind...

18:08.320 --> 18:13.713
Well, guys, I guess you're on your own.
Monique wants to go upstairs.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.592
Later, gators.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.917
Why can't guys be lik e Bud?

18:23.120 --> 18:25.236
Let's face it.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.556
We're with boys.

18:27.760 --> 18:31.469
Bud is a man. He knows
how to treat a lady.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.789
So, what's your point?

18:58.160 --> 19:01.596
My point is,
you have no respect for women.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.758
I mean, you treat them as objects
rather than real people.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.993
Look, I don't like it either, all right.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.556
But sometimes, to get the babes
to put out, you gotta pretend.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.239
Now...

19:13.440 --> 19:16.238
...l'm gonna give you
one last chance.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.590
Easy there, froggy.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.712
Go slow.
Show her what you've learned.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.037
And above all, respect her.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.839
Smooth move, Gilligan.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.592
I can't stand your bumbling
any longer.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.598
Look, let's face it...

19:58.160 --> 20:01.118
...your body isn't big enough
for the both of us.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.388
Your responses indicate...

20:03.600 --> 20:08.913
...that you own a burnt sienna,
mid-century Dodge with 800, 000 miles.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.874
To verify this information, press 1.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.555
Hello, Mr. Bundy.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.515
A live operator will be with you
in a moment.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.632
Peg, a real person's gonna be
on with me in a minute.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.389
- That's nice, dear.
- Help me! Help me!

20:35.640 --> 20:39.269
- He's trying to merge with me!
- I'll save you, baby.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.748
Al, call the police.

20:55.600 --> 20:59.195
- Bud? Do you need someone to talk to?
- Mom!

20:59.400 --> 21:01.755
Pull him off me!
He's taking over, Mom!

21:01.960 --> 21:03.234
Pull him off me!

21:03.440 --> 21:06.796
Well, I don't know, honey.
He's really, really big.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.196
I better just go get your daddy
to help me.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.312
You hold him there. I'll be right back.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.598
Hello, Mr. Bundy.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.268
Operator? You're alive!

21:20.480 --> 21:24.189
Barely, but it beats selling
Time-Life Books.

21:24.400 --> 21:28.154
Now, if you'll give me your credit card
number, we'll send your part right out.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.590
Al. Al, you have to help our son.

21:30.800 --> 21:33.553
Not now, Peg. I got a live person
on the phone here. Oh, man!

21:33.760 --> 21:36.194
In a couple of hours
I'm gonna be tooling in my Dodge.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.311
Operator, I gotta go get my wallet.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.875
Out of the way, woman!

21:45.040 --> 21:47.759
Hi, Bud. How you doing?

21:48.680 --> 21:51.911
I'm cool. It's cool.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.031
Everything's cool...

21:55.680 --> 21:57.671
...now.

21:59.280 --> 22:02.750
Bud, you know,
it's never too late to take vitamins.

22:02.960 --> 22:05.474
Oh, I had my PEZ this morning, Mom.

22:06.160 --> 22:08.799
About that PEZ...

22:09.000 --> 22:12.788
Damn job. Damn life. Damn diner.

22:15.880 --> 22:19.156
Daddy says never waste electricity.

22:21.080 --> 22:22.308
- Hi, pumpkin.
- Hi, Daddy.

22:22.520 --> 22:24.875
- I got a real person.
- Good, Daddy.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.070
If you build it...

22:36.280 --> 22:38.316
...he will come.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.233
If you want them to build it for you...

22:44.440 --> 22:46.192
...press 1.
