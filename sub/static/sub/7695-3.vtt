00:11.052 --> 00:13.894
Welcome to Perry's
Paradise Resort.

00:13.894 --> 00:17.398
Don't worry about your bags.
One of the robot bellhops
will get them.

00:19.140 --> 00:22.853
Ah, yeah, suitcase sled!
Whoo-hoo!

00:22.853 --> 00:25.566
You remember
my sweet niece Kerry.

00:25.566 --> 00:28.989
No, but would your evil
niece Kerry like to
introduce her to us?

00:28.989 --> 00:30.911
She's staying
for the weekend.

00:30.911 --> 00:32.613
Give her a room
with a view.

00:32.613 --> 00:34.155
Here you go.

00:34.155 --> 00:36.117
This is money
from a board game.

00:36.117 --> 00:38.539
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

00:39.870 --> 00:42.293
Don't worry,
I won't be a bother.

00:42.293 --> 00:44.125
You won't even
know I'm here.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.626
I just wanna spend
some quality time

00:45.626 --> 00:47.668
with my favorite
Auntie Terry.

00:47.668 --> 00:51.092
I have been accused
of being fun.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.674
And of identity theft.

00:53.674 --> 00:55.766
You're not fooling
us, Kerry.

00:55.766 --> 00:57.888
You act all nice
until your aunt's gone,

00:57.888 --> 00:59.890
and then you go off
to trip roller skaters

00:59.890 --> 01:02.523
and sell ice packs
to the injured.

01:02.523 --> 01:04.855
My sweet niece
would never do that.

01:04.855 --> 01:07.448
Everyone knows
the roller rink
is my turf.

01:08.819 --> 01:11.362
Dougie!

01:11.362 --> 01:15.366
Kerry, I'd like you to meet
your future uncle, Douglas.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.997
I've heard all about you.

01:16.997 --> 01:18.909
You're the one
obsessed with my aunt.

01:18.909 --> 01:20.751
Yeah.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.254
She is a, uh...

01:23.254 --> 01:26.127
handsome woman.

01:26.127 --> 01:29.130
Settle down, Romeo.
There's kids here.

01:30.761 --> 01:32.423
Come on. Help me
get her room ready.

01:32.423 --> 01:33.974
Yeah. Be right there.

01:39.480 --> 01:41.482
So this is the monster

01:41.482 --> 01:42.983
who owned you two
last year?

01:42.983 --> 01:47.398
What did she do,
not invite you to her tea party?

01:47.398 --> 01:49.280
Keep talking
and I'll snap

01:49.280 --> 01:52.153
those little twigs
you call arms.

01:52.153 --> 01:53.944
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:53.944 --> 01:55.576
These are bionic twigs.

01:56.827 --> 01:59.410
Well, this one is.

01:59.410 --> 02:01.412
From here down.

02:01.412 --> 02:05.045
So... what's your game, Kerry?

02:05.045 --> 02:07.838
Why are you really here?

02:07.838 --> 02:10.631
Gotta lay low
till the heat blows over.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.424
Got sloppy on
my last job back at Creek.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.306
What did you do
this time?

02:15.306 --> 02:18.309
Till the witness
wakes up, nothing.

02:20.931 --> 02:22.813
Just stay outta my way,

02:22.813 --> 02:24.725
and I'll stay
outta yours.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.901
Hey, she took
my wallet.

02:34.695 --> 02:37.037
Oh, man, she owned
you guys again.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.997
The world's first
bionic superhumans

02:46.997 --> 02:49.210
are stronger than us,

02:49.210 --> 02:51.882
faster,
smarter.

02:51.882 --> 02:54.755
The next generation
of the human race is...

02:54.755 --> 02:56.757
Living on a bionic island.

03:36.006 --> 03:37.638
Ah!

03:37.638 --> 03:39.390
Morning. Another day,

03:39.390 --> 03:41.802
another day to make the world
a better place.

03:41.802 --> 03:44.605
Well, this day's ruined.

03:44.605 --> 03:48.148
Uh! I just stepped on
broken glass.

03:48.148 --> 03:50.401
Things are looking up.

03:53.153 --> 03:55.736
Leo's tablet.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.738
Someone's been in here.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.990
We must not have heard them
because we were in our capsules.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.413
- Leo, wake up.
- Ah!

04:03.784 --> 04:05.496
Did you hear anything
last night?

04:05.496 --> 04:07.167
Someone broke in.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.750
No, but I am a really
deep sleeper.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.792
I cannot tell you
how many times

04:11.792 --> 04:13.714
I've woken up
in a body bag.

04:15.376 --> 04:17.637
This had to be
Perry's niece.

04:17.637 --> 04:21.471
Wow, you got schooled
by a toddler again?

04:21.471 --> 04:23.263
She broke your tablet.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.885
Bring her to me.

04:28.979 --> 04:31.101
Whoa. You're fast.

04:31.101 --> 04:33.814
Homely, but fast.

04:33.814 --> 04:35.816
We know what you did.

04:35.816 --> 04:37.858
Yeah, that thing
with the handcuffs.

04:37.858 --> 04:41.111
You've been going
to magic school.

04:42.663 --> 04:45.826
You're gonna replace
everything you stole or broke.

04:45.826 --> 04:48.749
- I didn't do it.
- That clears that up.
Back to bed.

04:48.749 --> 04:51.792
Hey, you're not
going anywhere.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.416
Aunt Terry!!

04:55.416 --> 04:57.508
[screaming]

04:57.508 --> 05:00.421
Did it occur to you
that I have bionic hearing?

05:00.421 --> 05:02.683
Nope, but good to know.

05:02.683 --> 05:06.136
- Aunt Terry!!
- [screaming]

05:10.691 --> 05:12.733
What is all
the yelling about?

05:12.733 --> 05:14.985
I didn't even have time
to put my face on.

05:14.985 --> 05:18.068
Wait, that thing's
removable?

05:18.068 --> 05:21.782
Your precious little niece
ransacked the place.

05:21.782 --> 05:23.994
I don't know
what they mean,
Aunt Terry.

05:23.994 --> 05:27.117
I was sound asleep,
dreaming of cute
little kittens,

05:27.117 --> 05:30.120
when I was ripped
out of bed by
this bionic she-man.

05:31.662 --> 05:34.334
How dare you accuse
my sweet little angel?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.716
Me, I get.

05:35.716 --> 05:37.548
Cousin Cletus,
Grandma Flat Nose,

05:37.548 --> 05:39.670
the Pug twins,
absolutely.

05:39.670 --> 05:42.723
But her? Impossible.

05:42.723 --> 05:46.807
You call your grandmother
Grandma Flat Nose?

05:46.807 --> 05:48.559
Not to her face.

05:48.559 --> 05:50.971
She's kinda hard
to look at.

05:50.971 --> 05:53.063
I can prove
Kerry's innocent.

05:53.063 --> 05:54.775
We'll just check
the security footage.

05:57.147 --> 05:58.649
The monitor's broken.

05:58.649 --> 06:00.691
I can't pull up
the security footage.

06:00.691 --> 06:02.743
It's okay.
I'll fix it.

06:02.743 --> 06:04.194
I can fix anything.

06:04.194 --> 06:05.946
I used to be the leading
technician for NASA.

06:05.946 --> 06:07.868
You worked for NASA?

06:07.868 --> 06:11.201
Yeah. The North American
Sumo Association.

06:12.583 --> 06:14.124
I put the pins on
the diapers.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.205
[grunting]

06:18.378 --> 06:21.802
- Fixie, fixie,
fixie, fixie!
- Wait, don't!

06:23.263 --> 06:26.597
Wow. Can't believe
that didn't do it.

06:29.349 --> 06:33.183
It's not working because
someone fried the server.

06:33.183 --> 06:34.855
That means all the cameras
are down.

06:34.855 --> 06:36.687
You knew you'd
get busted,

06:36.687 --> 06:38.649
so you destroyed
the evidence.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.441
[Leo] Guys
get in here quick.

06:45.195 --> 06:48.198
What do you have to say
for yourself now, Kerry?

06:48.198 --> 06:50.831
That you people
are slobs?

06:50.831 --> 06:53.033
Look, your niece
is playing you.

06:53.033 --> 06:54.915
The whole
"sweet and innocent" thing,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.837
it's an act.

06:56.837 --> 06:58.839
Aunt Terry,
I didn't do this.

06:58.839 --> 07:00.801
Of course you didn't.

07:00.801 --> 07:02.633
I'm gonna catch
the real culprit

07:02.633 --> 07:04.885
even if I have
to stay up all night,

07:04.885 --> 07:07.718
which will be easy,
'cause I spent the winter
in hibernation.

07:21.482 --> 07:24.024
Huh. When the dolls
are sleeping,

07:24.024 --> 07:26.737
they almost look human.

07:35.706 --> 07:36.917
I gotcha.

07:36.917 --> 07:39.750
Banzai!

07:39.750 --> 07:41.672
[yelling]

07:41.672 --> 07:44.214
It's me, Douglas.

07:44.214 --> 07:46.637
Oh. Well, I'm still
not getting up.

07:53.644 --> 07:54.855
What are you
doing here?

07:54.855 --> 07:56.937
I was just
getting a snack

07:56.937 --> 07:58.769
'cause I couldn't sleep.

07:58.769 --> 08:00.651
Oh. Well, you should've
called me.

08:00.651 --> 08:02.733
I would've sung you
a lullaby.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.776

08:05.776 --> 08:08.238

He is so into me,
it's embarrassing.

08:35.225 --> 08:37.688
You. What are
you doing here?

08:37.688 --> 08:39.980
No.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.692
No!

08:41.692 --> 08:44.524
[screams]

08:46.987 --> 08:49.319
What happened?

08:49.319 --> 08:51.652
Someone must've
attacked her.

08:51.652 --> 08:53.453
I was about to
check on her,

08:53.453 --> 08:55.576
but I need one of
you guys to make sure

08:55.576 --> 08:57.618
she's really unconscious

08:57.618 --> 08:59.960
before I get
my face too close.

09:02.753 --> 09:05.425
I think she's gonna
be okay.

09:05.425 --> 09:07.628
What, you're a doctor now?

09:07.628 --> 09:10.170
I checked her pulse.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.222
No, sorry, I wasn't
making fun of you.

09:12.222 --> 09:13.844
I just wanted to see
if you'd take a look
at this rash.

09:15.806 --> 09:18.679
Oh, my head.

09:18.679 --> 09:20.641
Douglas, get her
to the infirmary.

09:20.641 --> 09:22.522
Good idea.

09:22.522 --> 09:24.524
Let's put her down
humanely.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.783
I can't believe Kerry
would hurt her own aunt

09:32.783 --> 09:34.655
just to get away with
more crimes.

09:34.655 --> 09:36.116
Doesn't make sense.

09:36.116 --> 09:38.408
What if it's not her?

09:38.408 --> 09:40.580
Who would wanna
hurt Perry?

09:40.580 --> 09:44.084
Correction. Who would
actually hurt Perry?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.086
Let's think this through.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.588
First, Leo's tablet
was damaged.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.671
Maybe someone was trying
to find classified information

09:50.671 --> 09:52.633
but couldn't figure out
the password,

09:52.633 --> 09:54.675
so they tossed it aside.

09:54.675 --> 09:56.717
Then, the criminal disabled
the security cameras,

09:56.717 --> 09:58.979
because they didn't want anyone
tracking their movements.

09:58.979 --> 10:00.981
When Perry started
pursuing them,

10:00.981 --> 10:03.523
- they probably
took her out.
- Guys, look.

10:04.815 --> 10:07.277
They took out
the hydraloop too.

10:07.277 --> 10:09.860
Whoever did this just
trapped us on the island.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.863
Wait. Those burn marks
are from bionics.

10:14.194 --> 10:16.536
The last time
something like this happened,

10:16.536 --> 10:18.829
it was Sebastian
leading a rebellion.

10:18.829 --> 10:21.832
Guys...

10:21.832 --> 10:25.085
there's still a rebel
living among us.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.755
How could there still
be a rebel here?

10:34.755 --> 10:37.217
I don't know, but for now,
everyone's a suspect.

10:37.217 --> 10:39.059
You!

10:39.059 --> 10:42.853
I knew it was you
all along.

10:42.853 --> 10:46.106
I was with you
the whole time.

10:46.106 --> 10:48.398
Me!

10:48.398 --> 10:50.821
I knew it was me
all along.

10:53.403 --> 10:57.407
Sebastian's rebellion
almost destroyed this academy.

10:57.407 --> 10:59.239
I'm not gonna let that
happen again.

10:59.239 --> 11:01.411
Everyone back to the dorm.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.204
You're on lockdown
until further notice.

11:04.204 --> 11:06.877
Good idea. We'll keep
'em there until we can
question everyone.

11:08.378 --> 11:10.711
♪ Here comes the bride ♪

11:10.711 --> 11:12.632
Good news is,

11:12.632 --> 11:14.715
she checked out okay.

11:14.715 --> 11:16.797
Bad news is,

11:16.797 --> 11:19.099
she checked out okay.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.183
Okay, what happened?
Who attacked you?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.976
Oh, I'm still
a little foggy,

11:25.976 --> 11:29.609
but I remember being
on the front lines.

11:29.609 --> 11:33.944
Then, out of the darkness,
11 giant guys in helmets

11:33.944 --> 11:35.695
started to charge me.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.527
No, wait.

11:37.527 --> 11:40.660
That was when I ran onto
the field during the Bears game.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.743
That was you?

11:42.743 --> 11:44.745
I thought that was
a mascot.

11:46.496 --> 11:50.460
So you seriously don't
remember being shot at?

11:50.460 --> 11:52.793
[scoffs] Look,
all I know is that

11:52.793 --> 11:54.965
some bionic freak
attacked me,

11:54.965 --> 11:57.047
and I could really
use a hug.

12:04.264 --> 12:05.766
No. Can't. Sorry.

12:07.848 --> 12:10.150
Look, we have to stop
that rebel.

12:10.150 --> 12:12.853
We'll split up and
patrol the academy.
Any questions?

12:12.853 --> 12:14.734
Yeah. Now that you know
it wasn't me,

12:14.734 --> 12:16.987
is there something
you'd like to say?

12:16.987 --> 12:18.779
Yes.

12:19.659 --> 12:22.863
Can I please have
my wallet back?

12:31.171 --> 12:33.543
3:00 a.m.
Common area is clear.

12:33.543 --> 12:36.426
Living quarters,
all clear.

12:36.426 --> 12:39.259
All clear here, too.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.680
Here that, Douglas?

12:40.680 --> 12:42.682
I'm all alone.

12:44.184 --> 12:46.556
Somebody else
say something.

12:46.556 --> 12:47.938
Please.

12:49.980 --> 12:52.692
Adam, what about
the weapons area?

12:52.692 --> 12:54.734
All clear in
the boom-boom room.

12:54.734 --> 12:57.487
[growling]

12:59.279 --> 13:01.281
Checked the capsule dorm
three times.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.034
It's all clear.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.166
Are you texting?

13:06.166 --> 13:07.707
No.

13:07.707 --> 13:10.460
I can hear you.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.672
Fine. I'll stop.

13:14.504 --> 13:15.795
[phone chimes]

13:18.258 --> 13:20.260
"Chase is a jerk"?

13:22.092 --> 13:25.265
I think you sent this
to the wrong person.

13:25.265 --> 13:27.427
Nope.

13:28.638 --> 13:30.810
How's the training area, Leo?

13:32.482 --> 13:35.896
Leo. Leo!

13:35.896 --> 13:39.239
Guys, he's not responding.
Get down here fast.

13:42.032 --> 13:43.073
Where is he?

13:43.073 --> 13:45.655
Has anyone seen Leo?

13:45.655 --> 13:47.787
Yes. He's
a 16-year-old male,

13:47.787 --> 13:50.290
about 5'7", answers to
the name Leo.

13:52.752 --> 13:55.215
Guys, I know
you're fearing the worst,

13:55.215 --> 13:58.508
but you have to remember,
it's only Dooley.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.881
- [explosion]
- Whoa!

14:00.881 --> 14:04.094
Oh, no.
The weapons room.

14:04.094 --> 14:05.725
Let's go.

14:05.725 --> 14:07.767
[groaning]

14:11.731 --> 14:13.353
I got it.

14:19.779 --> 14:21.611
That was close.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.243
The rebel almost blew up
the whole academy.

14:23.243 --> 14:25.575
[Douglas shouting]

14:25.575 --> 14:27.577
Of course.

14:27.577 --> 14:29.659
It's you.

14:29.659 --> 14:31.201
No. No, no, no.

14:31.201 --> 14:32.792
No, please.
Please don't hurt me.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.254
[screams]

14:34.254 --> 14:35.916
Duggles!

14:41.551 --> 14:44.214
No. The one person
I cared about.

14:47.427 --> 14:49.219
First Perry,
now Douglas.

14:49.219 --> 14:52.352
The rebel's trying
to take us out one by one.

14:52.352 --> 14:53.813
We're officially
under attack.

14:53.813 --> 14:57.147
Oh, man, really?
It's the weekend.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.190
- [explosion]
- Another blast.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.863
Go. I'll stay here
and nurse him back to health.

15:05.785 --> 15:07.447
Stay with me, Dougie.

15:07.447 --> 15:09.529
Don't go toward
the light.

15:09.529 --> 15:11.911
I gotta be honest.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.535
I'm runnin' toward
the light.

15:21.751 --> 15:23.593
The rebel's in
the training area.

15:23.593 --> 15:26.676
Oh, man, I didn't know the gym
was open 24 hours.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.510
Let's do this.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.860
Who's there?
Show yourself.

15:45.025 --> 15:46.656
Leo?

15:46.656 --> 15:48.908
What is going on?
Who else is in there?

15:48.908 --> 15:52.742
No one. Leo's the one
who's been attacking us.

15:52.742 --> 15:54.664
I knew it.
Leo's the rebel.

15:54.664 --> 15:56.876
Who else would wanna
take over the island?

15:56.876 --> 15:59.419
Wait, why is Leo
the rebel?

16:03.843 --> 16:05.715
What is wrong with him?

16:05.715 --> 16:09.139
He's sleepwalking because
his bionics are going haywire.

16:09.139 --> 16:10.720
He's not rebelling.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.093
He's in a bionic trance.

16:13.093 --> 16:16.686
I'm in a trance watching you
talk all science-y.

16:24.154 --> 16:26.486
Your capsules calibrate
your bionics

16:26.486 --> 16:27.737
with your nervous systems,

16:27.737 --> 16:29.909
but since Leo
doesn't have a capsule,

16:29.909 --> 16:31.071
everything's
out of whack.

16:31.071 --> 16:33.413
So technically,

16:33.413 --> 16:35.495
this is your fault
for not giving him one.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.957
Come on,
he's barely bionic.

16:43.713 --> 16:45.295
That's it,
I'm waking him up.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.257
No, no.
The sudden stimulation

16:47.257 --> 16:48.758
could cause his arm
to glitch even more.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.760
Right now,
it's firing externally.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.264
If his laser spheres backfire,
it could blow him apart.

16:54.264 --> 16:57.517
Do it, do it, do it.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.692
If we don't do something,
he's gonna destroy

17:02.692 --> 17:04.444
the whole island.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.695
You guys have to find
a way to contain him.

17:06.695 --> 17:08.698
Then I can
recalibrate his arm.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.464
He's gone.

17:25.464 --> 17:27.337
Good. That means
the gym's free.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.838
I'm gonna go do
some cardio.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.722
[groans]

17:48.067 --> 17:50.150
Kerry.

17:50.150 --> 17:52.192
Have you seen Leo?

17:52.192 --> 17:54.244
Sixteen-year-old male,
about 5'7", answers to
the name Leo.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.748
Uh, yeah, he went
somewhere else.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.467
Hey.

18:08.668 --> 18:10.470
Cool hat. I got one
just like it.

18:17.307 --> 18:18.308
Leo.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.431
If you know
what's good for you,

18:21.431 --> 18:24.023
you'll pretend
you never saw this.

18:25.815 --> 18:28.107
Wait. Why do you
look so weird?

18:34.694 --> 18:37.497
[Adam] How are we gonna stop
Leo without waking him up?

18:37.497 --> 18:39.869
Oh, I know how
to keep him asleep.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.080
Just have Chase
talk to him.

18:43.703 --> 18:47.507
I just sent you
a pointedly worded text.

18:49.209 --> 18:51.671
[high-pitched screams]

18:51.671 --> 18:52.752
That's Kerry's scream.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.557
- [screaming continues]
- Don't worry, Kerry.
We're here to...

18:57.557 --> 18:59.719
[Leo screaming]

18:59.719 --> 19:03.353
- Leo?
- Get her off of me!

19:06.186 --> 19:08.147
What happened?

19:08.147 --> 19:10.770
You just got body slammed
by a Brownie.

19:10.770 --> 19:14.033
Because you and your toy arm
attacked me.

19:14.033 --> 19:15.905
What are you
talking about?

19:15.905 --> 19:17.407
I was sleeping.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.739
Actually, you were
sleepwalking.

19:19.739 --> 19:22.832
Your bionics glitched
because Douglas never
gave you a capsule.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.916
But I did give you bionics.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.128
Let's focus on that.

19:29.128 --> 19:32.131
Wait, how did you subdue him
without waking him up?

19:32.131 --> 19:34.214
Oh, he woke up.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.096
Hit 'em in the right place,
they always wake up.

19:38.968 --> 19:41.561
She's a Perry.

19:50.810 --> 19:52.442
Here you go, Leo.

19:52.442 --> 19:55.194
My gift to you.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.411
I don't know what to say...

20:01.411 --> 20:03.663
'cause I don't know
what it is.

20:03.663 --> 20:07.877
It's a capsule
for your arm.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.923
Well, Kerry's taking off.

20:13.923 --> 20:16.426
She said to thank you all
for a wonderful time.

20:16.426 --> 20:19.299
Yeah, I bet she did.
I'm missing a necklace.

20:19.299 --> 20:20.720
And I can't find
my watch.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.342
And I'm missing
the rest of my capsule.

20:36.816 --> 20:38.358
Going somewhere?

20:40.119 --> 20:42.782
Hey, Perry.
Over here.

20:42.782 --> 20:44.784
Forget you saw this,
and I'll let you have half.

20:44.784 --> 20:46.666
Half of this is mine.

20:49.329 --> 20:52.211
I caught your niece
stealing.

20:52.211 --> 20:53.873
[gasps]
Kerry.

20:53.873 --> 20:56.296
Stealing has
very serious consequences.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.927
What do you have
to say for yourself?

20:57.927 --> 21:01.721
Uh...
Uh, I was sleepwalking?

21:03.012 --> 21:05.014
Works for me.
Say hi to your mom.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.729
Ha! See ya.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.812
The police are on
the other side.

21:12.812 --> 21:14.193
Say hi to your cellmate.

21:15.315 --> 21:20.029
What? What?
No!
