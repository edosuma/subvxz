20:20.470 --> 20:23.515
Following me through time, Batman?

20:23.765 --> 20:24.892
I'm beginning to think...

20:25.142 --> 20:27.936
...you have
an unhealthy obsession with me.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.355
My obsession is with justice, Grodd.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.232
Come and get some.

[GRUNTS]

20:39.531 --> 20:42.034
Did you say you had a plan
to deal with this monster?

20:42.284 --> 20:44.494
More of an idea than a plan. Aah!

20:45.746 --> 20:46.955
Plan, idea...

20:47.164 --> 20:48.540
Do something!

[SOLDIERS YELLING]

21:22.241 --> 21:24.993
No, you fools!
I didn't order a retreat.

21:25.202 --> 21:28.997
Come back! Aah!

21:36.755 --> 21:39.383
[ALL CHEERING]

21:46.848 --> 21:48.892
I owe you my thanks, humans.

21:49.101 --> 21:52.646
Perhaps there is more to your species
than meets the eye.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.732
And you, my son, I owe an apology.

21:55.941 --> 21:57.776
You are no traitor to your people...

21:57.985 --> 22:01.613
...only to our intolerant views
towards humans.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.073
Free the slaves.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.288
Farewell, old man.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.874
Though I treasure our friendship,
I hope you won't have to return here.

22:13.083 --> 22:16.837
Who knows, kid,
maybe next time you'll be visiting me.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.380
Really? Do you mean--?

22:18.588 --> 22:20.590
Kamandi. Down, boy. Down.

22:26.972 --> 22:28.932
Aw, nuts.
