WEBVTT

00:06.441 --> 00:09.226
- Previously
on "Deadly Class"...

00:09.270 --> 00:10.619
Maybe I finally
found a reason to live

00:10.662 --> 00:11.794
in a place
surrounded by death.

00:11.837 --> 00:13.448
- You don't have to be alone.

00:13.491 --> 00:16.103
- There is a cute
new boy in school

00:16.146 --> 00:17.713
who we both kissed

00:17.756 --> 00:19.845
but we're not supposed
to discuss him?

00:19.889 --> 00:22.152
- After everything
my family has done for you!

00:22.196 --> 00:23.762
You'd be dead
if it weren't for me!

00:23.806 --> 00:27.070
- Your family didn't save me.
They used me!

00:27.114 --> 00:30.813
- Bubble, bubble,
toil and trouble.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.250
I want the name
you stole from me, dickhead!

00:33.294 --> 00:34.860
People are killed every day.

00:34.904 --> 00:36.471
But if I'm gonna
get famous,

00:36.514 --> 00:38.560
I've got to do this
with pizzazz.

00:38.603 --> 00:41.867
And yes, Mr. Donahue,
the exclusive is yours.

00:41.911 --> 00:43.739
"If you
don't find me in three days,

00:43.782 --> 00:46.307
"this psycho's gonna
send me home with a note

00:46.350 --> 00:47.699
"about who did it.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.397
- You must have heard by now

00:49.440 --> 00:51.660
that Yukio
was found with his throat cut.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.532
- He deserved much worse.
- I, too, lost a child.

00:54.576 --> 00:56.404
- Any parent
who has lost a child

00:56.447 --> 00:58.536
could see through
your false grieving.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.496
I'll have to take your daughter
to protect her.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.237
- I go through his stuff
when he's not in the room.

01:03.280 --> 01:05.456
- You reek, Mr. Shabnam!

01:05.500 --> 01:07.241
- It's a jailbreak!

01:07.284 --> 01:08.938
- If we don't stop Chester

01:08.981 --> 01:10.766
and get Chico's head,
the cartel--

01:10.809 --> 01:12.289
- The cartel will kill her

01:12.333 --> 01:13.682
and the serial killer
will kill you.

01:13.725 --> 01:15.423
Everyone will die.
We get it.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.251
- Y'all must be
out your damn minds.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.730
There are many causes
I'd die for.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.428
There ain't a single cause
I'd kill for.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.777
- I don't want
to be alone tonight.

01:21.820 --> 01:23.518
Stay with me?
- Of course.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.260
- You idiot!
- You violated your curfew.

01:26.303 --> 01:27.609
Tonight you will go
to this address.

01:27.652 --> 01:28.610
Guard it with your life.

01:28.653 --> 01:29.785
Saya?

01:29.828 --> 01:31.613
- You're late
for family dinner.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.528
- If you love someone enough
to die for them...

01:33.571 --> 01:36.574
- Run!
- Then you surely will.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.472
- Thank you.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.953
Thank you.

02:07.997 --> 02:11.305

03:05.315 --> 03:08.840
- Lin watches his daughter die.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.918
- Seeing anyone?

03:42.961 --> 03:44.789
- Nothing.

03:46.661 --> 03:49.403
- Last night when--when we...

03:49.446 --> 03:51.405
- I can't
get into this right now.

03:51.448 --> 03:52.928
Oh, holy balls, Arguello.

03:52.971 --> 03:55.104
You smell like a turd
fucked an oyster.

03:55.147 --> 03:57.585
- We've got bigger problems
than Pepe Le Pew.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.064
Chico's head is somewhere
in that house,

03:59.108 --> 04:00.849
but there's no motion inside.

04:00.892 --> 04:03.112
- Maybe no one's home.
- Maybe they're expecting us.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.853
- How the bloody hell
is this hillbilly riot squad

04:04.896 --> 04:06.463
gonna know we're coming?

04:06.507 --> 04:08.117
- They know a lot of shit
they shouldn't know.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.727
- Well, if they know a lot
about shit,

04:09.771 --> 04:10.946
maybe they can uncover
the mystery

04:10.989 --> 04:13.078
behind Marcus' foul stench.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.080
What ya got yourselves here

04:15.124 --> 04:17.648
is an old-fashioned
pants shitter.

04:17.692 --> 04:19.650
Likely on account he done
filled his belly

04:19.694 --> 04:22.479
with a load of hooch
and misdeeds.

04:22.523 --> 04:25.134
- Look, you want to be
in charge, control freak?

04:25.177 --> 04:27.963
That's fine,
happy to do it your way.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.530
But are you sure
we can count on her?

04:33.708 --> 04:35.579
- Of course we can.

04:37.364 --> 04:40.715
- I got optics on the backyard.
Saya was right.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.804
There are traps.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.501
There's no movement,

04:44.545 --> 04:47.461
no way of knowing
if they're in there or not.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.811
So what now?

04:49.854 --> 04:53.031
- I was just getting
a bad feeling and wondering,

04:53.075 --> 04:55.469
well, is this something
we really should be doing?

04:55.512 --> 04:58.646
- And I was hating myself
for thinking that Lex is right,

04:58.689 --> 05:01.039
and maybe we should just--
- Call the cops?

05:01.083 --> 05:04.129
- It does seem like the less,
you know, suicidal option.

05:04.173 --> 05:05.827
- Coming from
the Queen of the Damned?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.785
Words to heed.
- I didn't ask you to come.

05:07.829 --> 05:10.440
- What's that?
Why, yes, Maria.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.181
We're putting ourselves
in great danger

05:12.224 --> 05:13.922
to help you unscrew your pooch.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.445
How nice of you to notice.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.839
- Starting to see
why Willie bailed on you.

05:17.882 --> 05:21.059
- We're worried.
That's fair, right?

05:21.103 --> 05:25.107
This is gnarly.
We could die in there.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.677
- Billy's right.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.505
I was so focused on
convincing you guys to help,

05:31.548 --> 05:34.072
I never considered that.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.210
I-I guess I thought...

05:46.128 --> 05:48.652
This is what
we were trained to do...

05:48.696 --> 05:50.872
to take down a rabid animal,
a bully,

05:50.915 --> 05:53.440
like the piece of shit
inside the house.

05:53.483 --> 05:55.485
Look, I can't promise
that no one's gonna die,

05:55.529 --> 05:57.095
but we're making
the world safer,

05:57.139 --> 05:58.793
protecting a friend.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.056
- "I can't promise
no one's gonna die."

06:01.099 --> 06:03.450
Thank you for the
de-motivational speech, Coach.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.712
Jesus Christ.
- What?

06:04.755 --> 06:05.756
I'm just--I'm just trying to--

06:05.800 --> 06:07.062
- The rally speech

06:07.105 --> 06:08.759
before the march
into impending doom.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.065
It's not something people do
in the real world, mate.

06:10.108 --> 06:11.675
- A bit narcissistic.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.634
Like we need your
great sermon to motivate us.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.767
- Look, we're all
risking a lot to be here.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.204
This, whatever this is,

06:19.248 --> 06:21.119
this is our family,

06:21.163 --> 06:23.121
and Marcus and Maria need us.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.429
- We're with you.

06:26.473 --> 06:28.953
One for all and all for--

06:28.997 --> 06:30.259
- That's great.
That's great.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.782
You got Billy
doing it too now.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.262
Where does it end?
- When this all goes

06:33.305 --> 06:35.133
pear-shaped,
you'll come to my rescue?

06:35.177 --> 06:36.874
- Nothing's going pear-shaped.

06:36.918 --> 06:39.094
I've taken down way worse
shitheads than these guys.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.096
We have two objectives:
we take down

06:41.139 --> 06:43.185
the serial killers, and we
find Chico's head before--

06:43.228 --> 06:44.969
- We've heard the plan
a million times.

06:45.013 --> 06:49.104
You take us for idiots?
- One more for good measure.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.149
Mailman Lex walks up
to the front door,

06:51.193 --> 06:54.675
whistles a happy tune--
calm, cheerful.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.895
Just a happy mailman
with a special package

06:57.939 --> 06:59.767
with a not-so-happy delivery.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.468
- Petra and Billy
go around back.

07:05.512 --> 07:06.904
Watch your step.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.472
The backyard is
a minefield, literally.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.169
You're the backup team.

07:11.213 --> 07:13.998
Wait until Marcus gives
the word, detonate the bomb,

07:14.042 --> 07:16.218
and flank any hillbillies
causing trouble.

07:16.261 --> 07:20.527
This is bound to get noisy,
so a distraction is mandatory.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.964
Like we learned in class,
for a job like this,

07:23.007 --> 07:25.009
don't try and hide.
Misdirect.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.534
- Backdoor Betty
all hot and ready.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.840
- Boom, neighbors assume
the white-trash residents

07:29.884 --> 07:32.321
are firing off fireworks,
and we get a noise distraction

07:32.364 --> 07:33.844
to drown out Lex.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.633
I'll be topside,
waiting for the cue

07:39.676 --> 07:41.809
to enter the second floor.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.551
This is the point where
there's no room for mistakes.

07:44.594 --> 07:46.857
If they're in there,
they'll know we're coming.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.642
- Door's rubbish.
Precision blast.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.295
Not an ounce more
than necessary.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.085
- You want to take a break
and have a hug or what?

07:57.128 --> 07:59.522
- Gratitude doesn't
cost anything.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.274
- Just a little pussy.

08:12.317 --> 08:14.232
Must have sensed
its brethren nearby.

08:33.861 --> 08:35.340
You were serious about...

08:40.084 --> 08:41.912
- There's a weird,
dreamlike quality

08:41.956 --> 08:43.697
to doing something
this heavy.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.178
Like it's not really
happening.

08:48.136 --> 08:52.183
- The redneck serial killers
inside--very real.

08:53.881 --> 08:55.317
- I thought you weren't
afraid of death.

08:57.667 --> 09:00.888
- I guess it's easier
as a distant theoretical.

09:35.139 --> 09:36.837
You ain't gonna make it,
sassy pants!

09:36.880 --> 09:38.752
- What do you want?
- What do you want?

09:38.795 --> 09:41.755
- I just want to go home.
- Oh, pear-shaped, tits up.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.365
We are snookered.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.149
- No, no, please.
Please, I'll do anything.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.024
- Where the bloody hell
are they?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.809
- Butthole.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.725
- Why am I gonna die
in this barmy place?

10:38.768 --> 10:41.989
A bit of praise and a speech
on the merits of friendship?

10:42.032 --> 10:45.819
Sure, why not?
What do I have to--

10:45.862 --> 10:47.995
What the--

10:48.038 --> 10:50.693
- Lex!
-  Shit!

10:50.737 --> 10:54.871
- This one's good for killing!
- Marcus!

10:54.915 --> 10:58.309
- Ronald McDonald,
lord of the seven kingdoms!

11:00.007 --> 11:01.965
Jaw breaks!

11:03.532 --> 11:05.708
- Lex!
- Get your throat slit!

11:07.144 --> 11:08.537
- Everybody loves--

11:11.366 --> 11:15.457
- ♪ You're all I got,
take care of me ♪

11:19.026 --> 11:24.161
- ♪ Whiskey river,
take my mind ♪

11:24.205 --> 11:27.861
♪ Don't let her memory
torture me ♪

11:31.386 --> 11:33.127
- Don't you get none
of your queer blood on me!

11:34.955 --> 11:36.086
Coming through!

11:42.919 --> 11:43.920
- Oh, my God!

11:53.103 --> 11:56.237
- Pull down the fridge!
- Move the bloody thing!

11:56.280 --> 11:57.760
- Lex, shoot him!

11:59.849 --> 12:02.243
- Tits fucking up!

12:03.897 --> 12:05.899
- Whoo!

12:05.942 --> 12:08.423
Whoo-hoo, you puddles
gone and marched

12:08.466 --> 12:11.513
into the festering brown
butthole of the devil himself!

12:12.993 --> 12:14.124
- Too strong for my size.
Know why?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.301
Whoo!

12:17.345 --> 12:20.043
PCP, PCP, PCP!

12:20.087 --> 12:23.177
Screams from downstairs.
Your friends are dying!

12:23.220 --> 12:26.093
Mr. Rogers' raisins.
Ronald McDonald's red sack.

12:26.136 --> 12:28.095
It's all connected.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.923
Feel the lord
of the golden arches

12:29.966 --> 12:31.925
as he marches up your ass!

12:33.491 --> 12:35.972
- You fucked him, didn't you?

12:52.467 --> 12:55.383
Please don't cry.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.993
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:57.037 --> 13:00.649
All will be well.
All will be well.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.785
I sent somebody.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.787
They were supposed
to protect you.

13:09.484 --> 13:11.529
They were supposed
to protect you.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.794
I'm so sorry.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.802
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.848
You must clear your mind
of that.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.981
Do you trust me?
- Yes.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.634
- Okay.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.970
- Madame Gao,
are you all right?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.711
- What do you have for me?

14:04.713 --> 14:06.584
- I know where they went.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.112
- Billy, we should
blow the door.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.896
- Told them that we'd wait
for the signal.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.767
This is crazy stupid.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.034
- Why did you come?

14:23.863 --> 14:26.691
- 'Cause you're the only people
I like in the whole world.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.478
I mean, if you're gonna die,

14:30.521 --> 14:33.394
I figure I might as well
be with you when you do.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.747
- If I'm gonna die,

14:38.790 --> 14:43.143
could--could you...

14:43.186 --> 14:45.754
could we...

14:53.718 --> 14:55.111
- Tits up!

14:56.765 --> 14:58.071
- Fire in the hole!

14:59.811 --> 15:01.813
All right, you trailer park
paint-huffers.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.772
Get ready to meet Skynyrd!

15:03.815 --> 15:06.209
- Go! It sounds like
goddamn Beirut in there!

15:07.950 --> 15:09.604
- The door's thicker
than we thought.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.649
Here, come with me!

15:11.693 --> 15:13.086
We'll go up through
the second floor.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.565
- Well, we--we should go
through the front.

15:14.609 --> 15:16.045
I told Lex it was--
- Lex was wrong.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.655
Front door is death.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.788
Trust me, this is
the best backup plan.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.053
Screw it.

15:24.097 --> 15:26.055
- Oh!

15:26.099 --> 15:28.101
Y'all expecting company?

15:30.799 --> 15:34.194
You must think I'm some kind
of ding-a-ling.

15:34.237 --> 15:38.024
That door is fortified with
two feet of reinforced steel,

15:38.067 --> 15:40.940
welded by the giant dick
of Jesus Christ.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.638
- Whoo!

15:43.681 --> 15:47.120
- Cousin Jim,
go earn your mescaline.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.773
Rustle them out.

15:48.817 --> 15:52.821
Don't hurt Marcus.
We got plans.

15:52.864 --> 15:56.956
- Yeah, yeah, we do, yeah.
- Okay, go, go, go.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.220
- Oh, sweaty balls
on the devil's leg!

16:00.263 --> 16:03.092
Hot and sticky, vinegar, piss!

16:03.136 --> 16:06.574
You fluff boys about to learn
the stinky dick lesson

16:06.617 --> 16:11.927
of old Cousin Jim!
- Whoo, whoo!

16:11.971 --> 16:13.711
- Oh, fiddlesticks.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.804
- You piece of shit,
you were gonna let her kill me!

16:22.155 --> 16:23.852
Sue Ann likes to screw
and dance

16:23.895 --> 16:25.680
and skitter and howl and--

16:33.079 --> 16:35.516
I am risking
the future of my family

16:35.559 --> 16:37.953
to be here to help you.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.172
- And what does it
say about you

16:39.215 --> 16:41.217
that you risk so much
just to show me

16:41.261 --> 16:43.219
how much I need your help,

16:43.263 --> 16:46.266
to show that you could have
anything that's mine?

16:51.619 --> 16:54.056
- They were right about you.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.797
You are crazy.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.731
- You want to tell yourself
you slept with Marcus

17:16.774 --> 17:20.126
to pay me back,
but the truth is much scarier.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.563
- You should be grateful
I gave you a new reason

17:22.606 --> 17:24.043
to play the victim!

17:24.086 --> 17:26.784
- And you get to play
the assassin.

17:26.828 --> 17:30.919
Cynical and safe and alone!

17:40.320 --> 17:42.104
- You would have
killed Chico anyways.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.063
- If that makes you feel better
about what you did!

17:58.207 --> 18:01.906
- I'm through
with your self-pity!

18:01.950 --> 18:04.213
- Mud people in my house!

18:04.257 --> 18:07.782
Gran Gran does her own
cleaning, señorita!

18:07.825 --> 18:09.827
I ain't cooking
morning biscuits...

18:09.871 --> 18:12.743
- You don't belong here.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.006
- Come on.

18:17.835 --> 18:18.967
Come on.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.884
Come on.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.122
- Shh.
- I won't waste your time

18:43.165 --> 18:45.167
trying to lure you.

18:45.211 --> 18:47.126
- Remember when you first
learned how to swim?

18:47.169 --> 18:49.258
It was scary, huh?

18:49.302 --> 18:51.782
You were the smallest
in your class.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.698
But you showed those kids,
because you could

18:54.742 --> 18:57.658
hold your breath
for the longest time.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.054
- Goddamn junkies.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.797
- It's okay.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.974
Show Daddy how long
you can hold your breath.

19:14.022 --> 19:17.330
- Your daughter is the price
for your deception.

19:30.865 --> 19:33.346
Hold her close.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.783
Say your good-byes.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.084
Adios.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.815
- I am getting
the hell out of here.

20:51.859 --> 20:55.689
- Get off me.
- Well, come on, sweet tits.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.778
Party's moving downstairs.

20:57.821 --> 21:01.347
- That is clearly a trap, love.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.392
- Get the others
and get out of here.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.659
- Chester invited
the other one, the sweet tits.

21:33.944 --> 21:36.425

26:36.290 --> 26:39.641
- Come on.
Let's go to the rendezvous.

26:39.685 --> 26:42.078
Guys, we have to go.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.558
Come on!

26:53.873 --> 26:55.744
We have to find Marcus.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.186
Help him.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.188
- No.

27:07.408 --> 27:10.411
You people,

27:10.454 --> 27:14.415
you're all ticks,
draining me...

27:18.245 --> 27:20.421
Pulling me down with you.

27:23.424 --> 27:24.860
I'm done.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.246
- Live from
some fat kid's basement

28:46.289 --> 28:49.292
in the charming Sunset District
of San Francisco,

28:49.336 --> 28:51.251
Fairy Town, USA,

28:51.294 --> 28:54.776
it's "The Chester Fuckface
Variety Talking Hour."

28:57.213 --> 29:01.740
Our guest tonight, the dude
who tried to kill our host,

29:01.783 --> 29:04.220
Marcus Lopez Arguello.

29:06.353 --> 29:10.400
And now the man with the power
to kill us all,

29:10.444 --> 29:12.881
Chester Fuckface!

29:12.925 --> 29:17.668
- Thank you, thank you!
Welcome to the show.

29:23.239 --> 29:26.068
- Well, let's hear it
for our ginger orangutan

29:26.112 --> 29:28.375
whose scrotum looks like
a yam, Dwight Shandy.

29:31.334 --> 29:37.863
Now, today we gonna explore
what makes a monster.

29:37.906 --> 29:42.998
What's at the core of all
this ugliness and violence?

29:43.042 --> 29:45.348
Why do we feed off it?

29:45.392 --> 29:48.308
See, people used to go
to public executions,

29:48.351 --> 29:51.006
eat popcorn and butter breads.

29:51.050 --> 29:56.316
And today we fake those same
thrills with horror flicks.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.840
We immortalize mass killers

29:58.884 --> 30:01.321
and we ignore saints.
Why?

30:01.364 --> 30:04.106
- Well, I think we're at risk
of becoming a society--

30:04.150 --> 30:06.369
Aaah!
- Weren't your speaking turn!

30:11.026 --> 30:12.767
Anyway.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.205
People love monsters.

30:16.249 --> 30:21.950
And society breeds them
'cause it needs them, I figure.

30:21.994 --> 30:26.868
And since I been bred
by this world to be this...

30:26.912 --> 30:29.740
thing...

30:29.784 --> 30:34.180
shouldn't I enjoy
a little fame?

30:36.312 --> 30:41.796
So today,
here on national television,

30:41.840 --> 30:47.193
you're going to admit that you
are not the Orphanage Killer.

30:47.236 --> 30:52.807
It was me, Fuckface,
famous celebrity serial killer,

30:52.851 --> 30:54.243
done that good work.

31:00.946 --> 31:04.123
And you made me do it all.

31:05.907 --> 31:09.476
Made me do it
with your abuse of me.

31:09.519 --> 31:13.567
Blowing me up
triggered something bad,

31:13.610 --> 31:16.570
let loose my murder goose.

31:20.487 --> 31:22.924
- Sorry, this is gonna hurt
no matter what.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.407
- Go on.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.940
All right, yeah--yeah.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.943
Chester killed
all those people.

31:45.207 --> 31:47.122
- Because?

31:51.257 --> 31:53.085
- B-because...

31:58.220 --> 31:59.526
He's desperate
for some semblance

31:59.569 --> 32:01.267
of significance in the world,

32:01.310 --> 32:04.313
to make a mark, even if it is
just a smear shit stain.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.489
Because he can't make anything,
so he destroys.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.578
Because he's the type of guy
who'd screw a goat

32:08.622 --> 32:11.451
on national television if it
got people to pay attention.

32:11.494 --> 32:13.496
- He doesn't need a camera
to do that.

32:14.671 --> 32:16.064
- Hypocrite!

32:16.108 --> 32:17.326
When society came to reward you

32:17.370 --> 32:19.111
for my good work,
what'd you do?

32:19.154 --> 32:22.418
You took that credit,
gobbled that fame up!

32:22.462 --> 32:25.030
How many videos
are gonna circulate

32:25.073 --> 32:26.988
of this interview
when I put a hole

32:27.032 --> 32:28.990
in that ponderous
fucking brain?

32:29.034 --> 32:31.340
- Wait, wait, wait.
I'm sorry.

32:31.384 --> 32:35.605
Let me--let me make my point
for the viewers.

32:35.649 --> 32:36.998
Okay?

32:45.659 --> 32:49.097
This whole thing you've done,

32:49.141 --> 32:51.491
all these people you've hurt...

32:54.407 --> 32:56.409
All for the adulation
of strangers?

32:56.452 --> 32:58.889
- You figure?

32:58.933 --> 33:02.415
- Maybe you think
if enough people love you,

33:02.458 --> 33:03.894
it'll fill the void.

33:03.938 --> 33:05.548
- That's what you think
this is?

33:05.592 --> 33:07.463
Well, my daddy done me dirty,

33:07.507 --> 33:09.465
so I went looking
to make my damage public,

33:09.509 --> 33:12.338
exploit it for a paycheck
and a hug.

33:12.381 --> 33:14.035
You liberal types
love to tell folks

33:14.079 --> 33:16.995
how to think
and feel and speak.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.605
Oh, you know what's wrong
with everybody else.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.215
If only we'd follow
your highfalutin rules,

33:20.259 --> 33:22.043
the whole world
would be a golden globe

33:22.087 --> 33:25.177
of sunshine
and butterfly kisses!

33:25.220 --> 33:27.309
- All I'm saying...

33:29.442 --> 33:33.011
Sadness is rage turned inwards.

33:33.054 --> 33:36.362
And I look at you,
and all I see is sadness.

33:39.452 --> 33:43.151
You don't want fame.
You want to be loved.

33:43.195 --> 33:46.415
And the solution isn't on
the other side of that camera.

33:46.459 --> 33:49.636
Fame won't fix
what happened to you.

33:51.116 --> 33:54.380
You can't fix what's broken.
- Oh, you think I'm broken?

33:54.423 --> 33:56.686
- We're all broken.

33:56.730 --> 34:01.430
Spewing our damage, looking
for meaning, for justice.

34:01.474 --> 34:03.432
- What the hell
do you know about it?

34:06.348 --> 34:09.351
- I wanted to kill
Ronald Reagan.

34:09.395 --> 34:12.006
- Now, why would you want
to hurt the goodest president

34:12.050 --> 34:13.747
we ever done made?
- It doesn't matter.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.357
I was wrong, okay?

34:15.401 --> 34:16.967
Inflicting your pain
onto other people

34:17.011 --> 34:19.231
doesn't help fix you.

34:21.015 --> 34:23.365
When you're feeling weak
or sad or angry,

34:23.409 --> 34:25.019
friends and family
are the only thing

34:25.063 --> 34:27.369
that make you feel strong.

34:33.593 --> 34:36.726
My family are a bunch
of dumb hill people.

34:39.468 --> 34:42.689
I was happier
'fore they were around.

34:42.732 --> 34:45.257
- Family isn't defined
by blood.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.787
- I was happier
when I was with you.

34:57.660 --> 35:00.576
You were my first friend.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.755
Till you blew me up.

35:11.631 --> 35:15.417
- I'm sorry, Chester.

35:15.461 --> 35:18.159
We both did shitty things
to each other.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.381
What if we put it behind us?

35:24.339 --> 35:26.254
I've found
what you're looking for.

35:26.298 --> 35:30.563
The school I go to, dude,
they would love you.

35:33.218 --> 35:34.828
Come with me.

35:34.871 --> 35:38.701
We'll figure this whole thing
out together, as friends.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.149
- I would love to go
to your fucking school.

35:55.283 --> 35:58.199
I would love to be your friend.

36:06.729 --> 36:09.210
Pretty words.
You had me going.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.213
Fooling me!
Fooling my feelings!

36:12.257 --> 36:14.128
You're the kind of garbage
that makes folks

36:14.172 --> 36:16.086
lose faith in humanity!

36:19.525 --> 36:22.658
All the pretty words on Earth
won't never stop people

36:22.702 --> 36:26.488
from loving seeing a victim
getting bloody revenge!

36:33.756 --> 36:34.757
Peppermint, no!

36:56.692 --> 36:58.825
- He's done hounding you, kid.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.298
- Daddy!
Daddy!

37:37.342 --> 37:40.127
Daddy, open your eyes!
Wake up!

37:40.170 --> 37:42.869
Daddy?

38:05.718 --> 38:08.024
- You failed.

38:24.824 --> 38:25.868
- Shh.

38:41.971 --> 38:42.929
-  Daddy!

38:46.976 --> 38:49.327
- I will take her to the temple
and the great exam.

38:51.720 --> 38:54.201
- Daddy!
- Please, Gao, no.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.943
Please, please, Gao.

38:56.986 --> 38:59.162
She's not ready.

39:02.209 --> 39:03.863
- Nor was I.

39:07.257 --> 39:08.911
Daddy!

39:08.955 --> 39:12.001
- ♪ Sing me to sleep

39:12.045 --> 39:14.743
♪ Sing me to sleep

39:14.787 --> 39:18.051
♪ I'm tired and I

39:18.094 --> 39:21.489

39:24.449 --> 39:27.321

39:29.802 --> 39:33.980

39:34.023 --> 39:38.419

♪ I will feel so glad to go

40:11.452 --> 40:14.368
- All I ever did was love you.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.239
- I never asked for that.

40:21.027 --> 40:23.856
- You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

40:23.899 --> 40:26.424
- ♪ Sing me to sleep

40:26.467 --> 40:30.253
- Saya's cynicism--
she's right.

40:30.297 --> 40:34.127
I shouldn't have
let myself care.

40:34.170 --> 40:37.217
You were alone too.

40:37.260 --> 40:39.393
I thought you'd see.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.178
- I was. I did.

40:42.222 --> 40:46.792
- Lies I was desperate
to believe.

40:46.835 --> 40:49.925
But I always knew better.

40:49.969 --> 40:52.885
Always knew I can't count
on anyone but myself.

40:57.106 --> 41:00.022
- That's the last thing
I wanted.

41:00.066 --> 41:03.591
I'm so sorry.
What I did was--

41:03.635 --> 41:05.071
it was messed up.

41:05.114 --> 41:08.161
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

41:08.204 --> 41:11.991
It all just started to feel
like an--an obligation.

41:12.034 --> 41:14.297
- ♪ There is another world

41:14.341 --> 41:15.821
- An obligation?

41:17.953 --> 41:21.174
- ♪ There is a better world

41:21.217 --> 41:23.872
♪ Well, there must be

41:23.916 --> 41:25.570
- I didn't mean
you were an obligation.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.485
- Yes, you did.

41:27.528 --> 41:30.226
And you're right,
I'm broken.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.533
I've been tied up
my entire life.

41:32.577 --> 41:36.015
That's all I know,
so I made you my new rope.

41:36.058 --> 41:38.844
But I'm done with that.
You're free.

41:38.887 --> 41:39.932
We both are.

41:39.975 --> 41:41.324
- Saya and I,
we never planned it.

41:41.368 --> 41:43.892
I-I messed up,
but it did make me see, I--

41:46.242 --> 41:48.418
I do love you, Maria.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.161
- After all we've been through,

41:52.205 --> 41:55.164
can you just do me
one small courtesy?

41:55.208 --> 41:57.515
Stop lying.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.996
- Maria.

42:19.580 --> 42:23.497
I was hoping to ask you
if you had found my son.

42:27.327 --> 42:29.938
I see that you have.
- What's taking so long?

42:29.982 --> 42:31.636
We've got to get out of here
before this whole thing goes...

42:31.679 --> 42:33.072
tits up.
