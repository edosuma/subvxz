WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.862
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

00:03.737 --> 00:06.205
You won't believe
what happened to me today.

00:06.272 --> 00:07.364
What?

00:07.440 --> 00:11.809
Wayne County Community College called
the set and wants me to teach a class.

00:13.046 --> 00:14.946
<i>How to Blow Yourself Up 101?</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:18.678
You know, these barbs
draw blood sometimes.

00:18.752 --> 00:21.243
It's actually a 12-week course
in auto repair.

00:21.321 --> 00:24.222
You'd be great teaching auto shop.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.384
That's what the dean said.
What do I know about teaching?

00:27.460 --> 00:30.554
<i>- Isn't that what you do on Tool Time?
- No.</i>

00:30.630 --> 00:33.360
Tool Time is a veiled attempt
at entertainment.

00:34.567 --> 00:38.230
Teaching is serious business.
You're talking about kids' futures.

00:38.304 --> 00:43.071
If you don't prepare just right they're
gonna heckle ya, throw spitwads at ya.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.907
- They don't do that stuff in college.
- Want to bet?

00:47.080 --> 00:50.208
You're always saying
that you want to give something back

00:50.283 --> 00:51.910
to the automotive community.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.112
I give them 30 percent
of my annual income already.

00:56.056 --> 01:00.356
No, look. You'll finally get to share
your knowledge of cars.

01:00.427 --> 01:03.157
I share that knowledge with you guys
all the time.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.460
But now you'll be sharing it
with someone who's interested.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.785 --> 01:59.945
Hello, class.

02:00.053 --> 02:02.920
Oh, whoa. Wayne Community College
is proud to present

02:02.989 --> 02:05.287
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.725
Ha, ha! What's up?
What's up?

02:10.830 --> 02:12.764
- Welcome.
- Thank you, Heidi.

02:12.832 --> 02:16.324
- No, man, it's Billy.
- But we'd trade him for Heidi.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.631
Thank you, flat top.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.265
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

02:22.342 --> 02:24.708
For the next 12 weeks
you will be my assistants.

02:24.811 --> 02:25.903
Yeah. All right!

02:25.979 --> 02:28.846
We're gonna talk about
the most important part of a car.

02:28.915 --> 02:32.351
The back seat?

02:32.418 --> 02:35.751
They'll be covering that
in Miss Hensley's class down the hall,

02:35.822 --> 02:37.653
<i>Our Bodies, Ourselves.</i>

02:39.859 --> 02:42.419
We're gonna focus
on the engine, actually.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.020
- All right!
- No, no, sit, sit, sit!

02:45.098 --> 02:48.363
You don't need tools today.
All you need is paper and pencils.

02:48.434 --> 02:51.926
I'm gonna do a history lesson
about the internal combustion engine.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.633
It's interesting
because most people don't know

02:54.707 --> 02:57.232
it was developed
in a little village in France.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.875
- That's cold.
- Very good spit to wad ratio on that.

03:07.587 --> 03:09.145
Very nice, very nice.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.621
Is this not interesting?
Is that the problem?

03:11.691 --> 03:14.455
- We came here to get our hands dirty.
- Oh, really?

03:14.527 --> 03:19.226
Well, look. The school curriculum says
the first lesson is just lecture, OK?

03:19.299 --> 03:22.063
Since when does "The Tool Man"
follow instructions?

03:22.168 --> 03:26.127
Right. He didn't follow them
when he fell in that port-a-potty.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.301
You know, this material is boring
but it may come up on a test.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.003
You make the tests.

03:32.078 --> 03:33.340
I do?

03:35.148 --> 03:37.412
I can give D's rather than get them?

03:39.786 --> 03:41.117
I'm the king.

03:41.187 --> 03:44.088
And these are my subjects.
I say, let's get greasy.

03:44.157 --> 03:46.523
Great! All right!

03:49.095 --> 03:50.528
We gotta get to the movies.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.293
I know. I just gotta
set up the table for your dad.

03:53.366 --> 03:56.802
He's running late. I hope he didn't
forget about the poker game.

03:56.869 --> 04:00.532
Dad forget about poker?
It's like Mark forgetting to be a dork.

04:02.742 --> 04:05.370
Or Randy forgetting
to wear the color "puke."

04:07.013 --> 04:10.949
Can we get through the rest of
this evening without any more insults?

04:11.017 --> 04:12.712
Mom, I'll drive to the movies.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.946
Geek-boy and Vomit-Shirt
can sit in back.

04:17.290 --> 04:20.190
Sorry I'm late.
Thanks for putting the table together.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.592
- How did your first class go?
- It was great.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.596
So much energy.
I love school.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.928
And I think hell just froze over.

04:27.867 --> 04:31.303
The two hours went by like that.
They picked my brain clean.

04:31.371 --> 04:34.033
What did you do
for the other hour and 59 minutes?

04:36.909 --> 04:40.276
I thought about what I was gonna buy
with your allowance.

04:40.380 --> 04:44.043
I want to hear all about the class
when we get back from the movies, OK?

04:44.117 --> 04:48.247
You don't have to leave. I'm making my
"mucho macho" chili. Stick around.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.687
Five men and a vat of chili.

04:53.359 --> 04:56.089
Hm. You might want to get a hotel room.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.356
Later.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.529
All right. Cut those.
Everybody in.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.731
The game, gentlemen, is Five Card Draw.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.569
Jacks back, snake in the grass.

05:08.641 --> 05:12.407
So, Professor Tim, how was your
first day in the world of academia?

05:12.512 --> 05:15.174
It was great.
I have a really cool group of students.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.615
Hey, during roll call
was anyone named Seymour Butts?

05:19.819 --> 05:21.878
Or Jacques Strap?

05:22.722 --> 05:25.156
Or Kay O'Pectate?

05:26.392 --> 05:28.952
Whers the last time
you were on a campus, Harry?

05:29.028 --> 05:31.758
Oh, let's see. I got out of 'Nam in '71,

05:31.831 --> 05:34.527
so that would make it... never.

05:35.401 --> 05:37.869
You ever thought
of going back to school, Al?

05:37.937 --> 05:40.064
I don't know.
What would I do at school?

05:40.139 --> 05:42.505
Well, you could become
a lab experiment.

05:43.710 --> 05:45.678
Let's go, guys.
I've got rent to pay.

05:45.745 --> 05:48.771
You don't pay rent.
You mooch off your aunt.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.140
It was a figure of speech.

05:52.418 --> 05:54.978
Right up there with,
"My wallet's in the car."

05:56.589 --> 05:58.056
I need two and I'm in.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.255
- Anybody want chili?
- Is it spicy?

06:01.327 --> 06:03.693
Take the chrome off a bumper
with this stuff.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.658
I'll eat it.
Extra onions.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.229
How could you digest that stuff?

06:09.302 --> 06:11.964
I said I'd eat it.
I never said I'd digest it.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.167
Harry, you want some?

06:14.240 --> 06:16.936
Oh, no, thanks.
I don't want to irritate my colon.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.375
Gee. Thanks for sharing.

06:24.617 --> 06:27.882
- Al, you want some of this?
- Oh, no, that stuff is way too spicy.

06:27.954 --> 06:31.219
- Do you have any salt-free crackers?
- Yeah, right here.

06:31.290 --> 06:33.952
Just have Benny
lick the salt off for you.

06:36.028 --> 06:39.088
- Wilson, you want some?
- Oh, no chili for me.

06:42.668 --> 06:46.229
I just got my cholesterol results.
I wish my IQ was that high.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.967
Wait a second. It is.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.678
We sound like a bunch of geezers.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.714
There's a very good reason for that.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.079
We are.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.353
I'm reminded of the novelist
Anthony Powell who said, "Getting old

07:01.421 --> 07:05.118
is like being increasingly penalized
for a crime you never committed."

07:05.191 --> 07:08.627
This is crazy. Come on,
we've got our whole lives ahead of us.

07:08.694 --> 07:11.629
You think young you are young.
We're young, right?

07:11.697 --> 07:13.631
We're young.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.594
That was pathetic.
Come on, say it. We're young.

07:17.670 --> 07:20.230
- We're young!
- We're vital.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.500
We're vital!

07:23.109 --> 07:25.669
We go out there and grab life
by the yahoos!

07:25.745 --> 07:28.305
Yahoo! Yeah!

07:28.381 --> 07:31.748
Let's get this game going.
I want to be in bed by 10:00.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.987
Ooh!

07:40.092 --> 07:42.322
That's it for the day, everybody.
Good job.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.023
Clean up your stations.
I'll see you next time.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.059
All right. Wait, wait, wait.
Quick. Pop quiz:

07:50.002 --> 07:53.369
- What's the coolest car of all time?
- '72 Eldorado convertible.

07:57.577 --> 08:01.513
- No.
- The '67 Mustang Fastback.

08:01.581 --> 08:03.549
Interesting, but so wrong.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.810
'66 Karmann Ghia.

08:08.721 --> 08:10.621
Get some help, Grant.
Get some help.

08:11.958 --> 08:15.086
'65 GTO with a 389 tri-power.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.492
- Color?
- Montero red.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.690
Montero red! So close and yet
so definitely wrong.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.563
Palmetto blue. Palmetto blue.

08:22.635 --> 08:25.900
- Wait a minute. Are we graded on this?
- Just you, Heidi.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.803
Billy. It's Billy.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.771
Tim, we're headed to Carmine's
for pizza. You want to come?

08:31.878 --> 08:34.403
Are you sure you want to be seen
with your teacher?

08:34.514 --> 08:37.210
You're not like a teacher, Mr. Taylor.
You're cool.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.376
So, you cats dig me, huh?

08:40.785 --> 08:42.879
Up until that last sentence, we did.

08:45.191 --> 08:49.093
You know, Grant, you're starting
to remind me of me at your age.

08:49.161 --> 08:50.822
Thanks.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.026
It's not a good thing.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.762
- Come on, we'll ride together.
- I don't know.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.998
Shotgun!

09:03.943 --> 09:06.275
Wait. So, the guy says to the bartender,

09:06.345 --> 09:09.007
"Who keeps saying
all these nice things about me?"

09:09.081 --> 09:12.517
And the bartender says,
"The peanuts. They're complimentary."

09:12.585 --> 09:14.746
This is good.

09:14.854 --> 09:17.118
Eight pieces of pizza,
I'm still laughing.

09:17.189 --> 09:20.556
It wasrt that funny in the car
with the windows rolled up, was it?

09:20.626 --> 09:22.787
I'm still hungry.
You got anything to eat?

09:22.862 --> 09:25.922
- Fridge is there. Help yourself.
- Is this your old lady?

09:25.998 --> 09:29.331
Yeah. Although when you meet her,
I might use some other term.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.165
- She's a babe.
- Yeah, she is a babe.

09:31.270 --> 09:34.706
If you think she's a honey, wait till
you see the honey in the garage.

09:34.774 --> 09:37.470
Hey, can I eat this?
Looks like tuna casserole.

09:37.543 --> 09:40.478
For your own safety, Grant,
don't touch the casserole.

09:40.546 --> 09:43.572
Put it down slowly, back away
and don't make eye contact.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.780
Whoa. It's a '55 Nomad.

09:50.856 --> 09:52.687
Fully restored.

09:52.758 --> 09:56.023
And fully restored again
after you dropped that beam on it.

09:57.463 --> 10:01.365
- What do you got under the hood?
- 395 horses. Listen.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.832
It sounds awesome.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.807
But I bet it wouldn't beat my Firebird
off the line.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.543
- You don't think so?
- Why don't we go find out?

10:13.613 --> 10:16.582
Oh, right. You want to go drag race
at 12:00 at night?

10:18.517 --> 10:19.779
All right.

10:20.953 --> 10:22.716
Our first field trip!

10:24.657 --> 10:25.954
Oh!

10:26.993 --> 10:29.154
- Tim, what's going on?
- Ahhh...

10:29.261 --> 10:31.786
Hey, guys, this is my babe.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.997
This is Grant, that's Brett,
that's Billy.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.035
Hi. Can I talk to you for a second?

10:37.103 --> 10:40.334
- Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Taylor.
- Oh, no, that's OK.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.499
I was just, uh, you know... sleeping.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.145
What are you doing rewing up the engine
at this hour?

10:51.217 --> 10:53.981
That was stupid.
That's why I'm taking it outside.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.683
Now?

10:58.758 --> 11:02.717
Yeah, I'm gonna go out
and do a little comparative driving.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.595
- You're gonna go drag racing?
- No!

11:06.666 --> 11:09.999
I'm not gonna take those kids
drag racing. We'll just cruise.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.629
Wouldrt it be cool
to take those kids off the line?

11:12.705 --> 11:14.138
Are you insane?

11:14.974 --> 11:17.704
You have to work tomorrow.
You should get some sleep.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.610
I've got more energy than I've ever had,
thanks to you.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.705
- Me?
- If you hadrt encouraged me,

11:22.782 --> 11:26.843
I wouldn't be with these guys having
fun. I'd be in bed with you. Gotta go.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.094
Who wants more breakfast chili?

11:37.163 --> 11:40.724
What's the difference between
breakfast chili and dinner chili?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.961
Well, in this case, about a week.

11:44.403 --> 11:45.927
How can you have so much energy

11:46.005 --> 11:49.771
after spending the night with a bunch
of guys screwing around with cars?

11:49.842 --> 11:52.777
Well, I think you answered
your own question, didn't you?

11:52.845 --> 11:55.609
Why would your students
want to hang out with you?

11:55.715 --> 11:57.478
'Cause they're sucking up.

11:57.550 --> 12:01.384
You gotta be pretty desperate
to suck up to an auto shop teacher.

12:02.421 --> 12:04.787
Guys! Come on,
you're gonna be late for school.

12:04.890 --> 12:08.587
- Oh, we don't want that, now, do we?
- No, we don't!

12:08.661 --> 12:11.186
Have a good day.
Bye.

12:11.263 --> 12:14.357
Am I crazy or did I hear you come in
at 2:00 in the morning?

12:14.433 --> 12:17.368
You're crazy.
It was closer to quarter to three.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.601
Hey, do you have any plans
next Tuesday night?

12:21.674 --> 12:23.039
No. Why, what's up?

12:23.109 --> 12:26.670
We could invite some of the students
and girlfriends for dinner.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.907
- Tuesday night's your poker night.
- I'll skip it.

12:29.982 --> 12:33.315
You've played poker every single
Tuesday night for seven years.

12:33.385 --> 12:37.412
It's getting to be a drag. All those
guys do is talk about bodily functions.

12:38.991 --> 12:42.449
- You love bodily functions.
- But I'm a doer, not a talker.

12:46.098 --> 12:48.032
Does everybody know what time it is?

12:48.100 --> 12:49.590
<i>- Tool Time!
- That's right.</i>

12:49.668 --> 12:53.001
<i>Welcome to Tool Time on location,
starring that man in the tub,</i>

12:53.072 --> 12:56.633
rub-a-dub-dub,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.074
- Thank you, Heidi.
- You're welcome.

12:59.145 --> 13:02.410
<i>Welcome to Tool Time on location.
I am Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.</i>

13:02.481 --> 13:04.779
And speaking of tubs, here's Al Borland.

13:06.952 --> 13:08.078
Thank you, Tim.

13:08.154 --> 13:12.022
We're gonna be doing a little repair
work on the Burnett family bathroom.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.356
To get the ball rolling we have
our friend and master plumber,

13:15.427 --> 13:19.591
Felix Myman, who's going to show us how
to get rid of a really nasty sink clog.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.429
And they say there's nothing good on TV.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.232
Felix, come on and join us.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.135
- Hello, Tim, Al.
- How are you doing?

13:27.206 --> 13:28.366
Great to have you back.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.739
Felix has more of his work on TV
than any other plumber I know.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.109
Years ago I had my own cable show.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.740
<i>Pipe Styles of the Rich and Famous.</i>

13:37.683 --> 13:40.652
Felix, from now on
let me do the jokes, OK?

13:40.719 --> 13:43.279
- Well, why don't we plunge right in?
- Al!

13:43.389 --> 13:44.913
All right, well...

13:45.424 --> 13:49.258
Now, the first thing you want to do
is determine the nature of your clog.

13:49.328 --> 13:53.389
Well, my guess is, there's something
foreign caught in the pipes.

13:53.465 --> 13:55.023
You think?

13:56.068 --> 13:59.435
Foreign? You mean like a Volkswagen?
Maybe Julio Iglesias?

13:59.505 --> 14:01.439
Maybe Stonehenge is in there.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.034
I'm on the clock, Tim. Every one
of your jokes is costing you money.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.840
Not to mention our viewers.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.340
To clear a foreign object
through the pipe I use a snake.

14:12.418 --> 14:14.511
That's pretty old-fashioned stuff.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.920
Hip, young guys are using compressed air
to clear their clogs.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.118
That's fine if you've got
hip, young pipes, Tim.

14:21.193 --> 14:25.129
But these old pipes,
compressed air can damage old plumbing.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.968
That's right. A snake may be slower,
but it's trusty and reliable.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.603
"Trusty" and "reliable.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.733
Are there two duller words
in the English language?

14:37.810 --> 14:41.644
Wait a minute. Yeah, there are.
Al, you don't have a middle name, do ya?

14:43.816 --> 14:45.784
Well, this clog won't budge.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.376
I'm gonna need a snake
with a retrieving auger.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.081
Wait a minute. Felix, come on.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.852
Go with compressed air. It's now.
It's "go with the flow, baby."

14:53.926 --> 14:56.394
If there was any flow,
we wouldn't be here.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.898
I'm gonna get my pipe snake.

14:59.999 --> 15:03.958
While Felix gets the retrieving auger,
why don't we take the time now to...

15:04.036 --> 15:05.401
Not so fast, Al.

15:05.471 --> 15:08.599
While he's gone...
Heidi, my master blaster, please.

15:08.674 --> 15:12.110
- Here you are, Tim.
- Thank you, Heidi.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.806
Uh... we might want to remind
our viewers that these are old pipes,

15:15.881 --> 15:19.647
and the master blaster blows
compressed air at 1,400 psi.

15:19.718 --> 15:23.814
Well, it used to. Until I removed
the regulator. Now it goes to 3,000 psi.

15:25.324 --> 15:28.191
Tim, that's an awful lot of pressure.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.490
"The Tool Man"
works great under pressure.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.266
- What are you doing?
- Clearing pipes with compressed air.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.334
Don't burst my bubble.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.302
That's not the only thing
your bubble's gonna burst.

15:39.371 --> 15:40.668
Oh!

15:43.342 --> 15:46.106
I worked on a sub in the Navy
and I know that sound.

15:46.211 --> 15:48.679
- What happens next?
- I'm going AWOL.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.447
Me, too.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.023
I'm going down.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.559
- Thanks, honey, for making this dinner.
- I wanted to.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.895
I've never seen you
so excited about dinner.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.697
It'll be great.
For dessert we'll go to the garage.

16:10.769 --> 16:12.999
I'll introduce us all to the hot rod.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.632
The dinner party of my dreams.

16:21.146 --> 16:23.444
- Hey, come on in.
- Hey, Tim. This is Christy.

16:23.515 --> 16:25.039
- That's Andi.
- Hi.

16:26.885 --> 16:28.113
Good to see you.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.553
This is my wife.
Everybody, this is Jill.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.682
Hi. It is so nice
to meet you, Mrs. Taylor.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.922
- Oh, please, call me Jill.
- Oh, I love your house!

16:37.029 --> 16:39.156
It reminds me of my mom's.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.933
This place is so retro.

16:42.001 --> 16:46.870
I've been meaning to ask you, where did
you find this great '80's furniture?

16:47.606 --> 16:49.506
In the '80's.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.737
- Do you guys want sodas?
- No, I brought brewskis.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.369
- Yeah.
- Not me. I'm driving.

16:54.480 --> 16:57.142
Whoa! Party.

16:57.216 --> 17:00.982
- Can I get you a glass? Paper towel?
- No, thanks.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.455
How's that carpet doing?

17:05.424 --> 17:07.186
Well, um...

17:07.291 --> 17:10.590
We got hors d'oeuvres.
You want to wait for Billy and his girl?

17:10.662 --> 17:13.722
- They may not be coming.
- They didn't call or anything.

17:13.799 --> 17:17.064
They were thinking of going to a club,
said they'd play it by ear.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.104
Jill planned the party for eight.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.332
- She took a lot of work to do that.
- It's OK.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.136
- There's more for the rest of us.
- Yeah! Great!

17:24.209 --> 17:26.473
- Yeah.
- Then again, maybe not.

17:28.012 --> 17:29.674
This meal was delicious, Jill.

17:29.748 --> 17:31.272
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.477
Oh, my God. The chickers all gone.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.611
I'm sorry. Did you want some?

17:36.422 --> 17:40.688
No, no! I'm just so surprised
that anyone ate my chicken!

17:42.795 --> 17:44.956
It was nice of you guys
to come by tonight.

17:45.030 --> 17:48.693
- Yeah. We know it's a school night.
- Oh, not for me.

17:48.767 --> 17:52.032
We're playing hooky tomorrow because
it's my birthday!

17:52.104 --> 17:54.231
Yeah, it's the big two-three.

17:58.010 --> 18:00.740
Grant and I are gonna go
and pick out a ring.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.782
- Oh! Are you getting married?
- No!

18:03.849 --> 18:06.113
Grant's buying me a nose ring!

18:08.353 --> 18:12.312
Nothing says "I love you" like a piece
of steel right through the nostril.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.657
I wanted to get a nose ring,
but Brett here thinks it's gross.

18:17.729 --> 18:20.664
- I'm with Brett.
- He wants me to get a navel ring.

18:20.732 --> 18:22.791
Yeah, so it'll match mine.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.392
Isn't it cute?

18:24.470 --> 18:27.337
Oh! Cool.
Matching "his" and "her" lint traps.

18:30.676 --> 18:33.440
- Oh. Can I use your phone?
- Sure. Yeah, yeah.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.412
You know, Jill's in college now.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.211
Yeah. I went back
for my Master's in psychology.

18:39.852 --> 18:42.548
It was really hard
to go back at my age, but...

18:42.621 --> 18:46.751
...I've always been fascinated
by the complexity of the human mind.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.794
- Keg party in Ypsilanti!
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

18:49.895 --> 18:51.863
Billy said we should all drive up.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.262
I can fit six in my truck.
I've got the camper.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.632
If we leave now we can get there
for the first round of Thumper.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.069
- Whoo!
- Hey, hello. Hello.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.732
What about dessert?
Jill baked a real nice cake.

19:02.808 --> 19:05.174
We can look at the hot rod.
What do you think?

19:05.244 --> 19:08.805
- We can do that some other time.
- Come on, Jill. Let's party.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.279
No, guys, I'm sorry.

19:10.382 --> 19:13.044
But there's no way
on Tuesday night at 10:00

19:13.118 --> 19:14.881
that I could drive to Ypsilanti.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.956
I've got classes and
I've got to get three kids to school.

19:18.023 --> 19:21.652
You? We can pull an all-nighter
and get you back in the morning.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.627
Hmm. Let me think about it.

19:23.695 --> 19:25.356
No!

19:26.198 --> 19:28.029
I've got a real busy day tomorrow.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.627
I've got to go to Small Claims Court
about a little bathroom issue.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.305
If you don't want to go to Ypsilanti
we don't have to go.

19:35.374 --> 19:39.140
No, you guys go and have a good time.
I'll see you in class on Thursday.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.303
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:40.379 --> 19:41.437
- Thanks.
- Bye.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.482
- Mind if we take a piece of cake?
- Please help yourself.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.880
- Bye, thanks.
- Nice to meet you.

19:47.953 --> 19:50.786
- Thanks a lot, OK?
- Bye, Jill.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.918
Yeah, OK. Bye!

19:54.426 --> 19:56.087
- Drive carefully.
- Bye.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.667
- Well, they seem very nice.
- Yeah. Yeah, didn't they?

20:03.302 --> 20:06.601
If you like immature, irresponsible,
rude people they're nice.

20:06.672 --> 20:10.130
Honey, they're kids.
They were just acting like kids do.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.370
We never acted like that in college.

20:12.444 --> 20:16.471
Tim, do you remember
anything about college?

20:22.588 --> 20:25.352
I remember there were a lot of stairs.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.453
I'm sorry this evening didn't work out
the way you expected.

20:29.528 --> 20:32.793
I don't know what I expected.
I'm not 21 years old anymore.

20:32.864 --> 20:35.628
I bet it was fun to pretend you were
for a couple weeks.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.100
Did you ever envision yourself
in the future,

20:38.203 --> 20:40.228
married in the suburbs with three kids?

20:40.305 --> 20:41.431
No.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.270
I figured I'd spend the rest of my life
driving my van,

20:44.376 --> 20:46.936
<i>listening to In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
on an 8-track.</i>

20:47.746 --> 20:50.510
I guess it's not so bad
to be 40 instead of 20.

20:51.283 --> 20:55.515
It feels good to be settled, have some
roots, even though they're getting gray.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.380
To have a job, some money in the bank.
That's good.

20:59.458 --> 21:02.518
We don't have to worry about
getting lucky on New Year's Eve.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.757
We just have to worry about
staying awake on New Year's Eve.

21:07.833 --> 21:11.200
So, how was it, being married to
a college kid for a couple of weeks?

21:11.303 --> 21:13.362
Well, the sex was a lot better.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.940
No small thanks to the moves I learned
from Mrs. Hensley.

21:20.379 --> 21:23.439
- Mrs. Hensley?
- She had a class in the university.

21:23.515 --> 21:25.540
<i>Our Bodies, Ourselves.</i>

21:26.551 --> 21:30.647
She's 75 and she can do some wacky
things with the overhead projector.

21:34.826 --> 21:36.521
I know that sound.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.929
I worked in the Navy on a sub.

21:38.997 --> 21:40.760
What happens next?

21:41.967 --> 21:43.298
AWOL.

21:52.444 --> 21:53.968
We're going down.
