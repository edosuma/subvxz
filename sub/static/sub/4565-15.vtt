WEBVTT

00:04.771 --> 00:10.274
WELL, ANOTHER YEAR WE'RE
NOT GOING TO BE CHEERLEADERS.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.175
WHY DO YOU MAKE ME
DO THESE THINGS?

00:12.177 --> 00:15.611
POM-POMS ARE STUPID
AND PYRAMIDS MADE OF
HUMANS FREAK ME OUT.

00:15.613 --> 00:20.682
- AND WHAT ARE THESE?
- THESE ARE YOUR LEGS.

00:23.620 --> 00:25.620
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN ANYTHING SO WHITE?

00:25.622 --> 00:28.222
ONE TIME WHEN I LOOKED
INTO THE SUN.

00:29.925 --> 00:31.858
THESE NEED TO BE PUT AWAY.

00:31.860 --> 00:34.894
WE HAVE TO GO TO DEMOLITION
RIGHT NOW AND GET CLOTHES.

00:34.896 --> 00:38.264
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA
FIND OUT WE TOOK THESE THINGS.

00:38.266 --> 00:40.933
BUT MY CURFEW'S
IN FIFTEEN MINUTES.

00:40.935 --> 00:44.770
BUT THEY'RE HAVING A SALE.
VINTAGE T-SHIRTS.

00:44.772 --> 00:49.240
OOH, I DO LOVE T-SHIRTS THAT
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY LOVED.

00:49.242 --> 00:51.809
YOU ARE THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW
THAT HAS TO BE HOME BY SEVEN.

00:51.811 --> 00:54.611
IT'S RIDICULOUS.
THEY TREAT ME LIKE A BABY.

00:54.613 --> 00:56.713
- WHO?
- MA-MA DA-DA.

00:58.249 --> 01:00.983
IT'S TIME I WAS TREATED
LIKE THE WOMAN I AM.

01:00.985 --> 01:04.352
- I AM GOING TO DEMOLITION!
- THAT'S THE SPIRIT!

01:05.688 --> 01:08.321
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY
COMING, ARE YOU?
- NAH.

01:08.323 --> 01:11.490
WAIT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?  I AM.

01:11.492 --> 01:14.392
I AM OLD ENOUGH TO STAY
OUT PAST SEVEN O'CLOCK.

01:14.394 --> 01:17.928
WHAT'S THE DAMAGE FOR THIS,
IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION?

01:17.930 --> 01:19.896
BROKEN CURFEW?
CHUMP CHANGE.

01:19.898 --> 01:21.530
WHOLE THING BLOWS
OVER BY WEDNESDAY.

01:21.532 --> 01:25.299
- WORTH IT!  LET'S DO THIS!
- GREAT!  SEE YOU WEDNESDAY.

01:26.902 --> 01:29.002
<i> ♪ I'M SINGING GO-O-O-O. ♪</i>

01:29.004 --> 01:30.903
COME ON, AUGGIE.
JUST PICK A BABYSITTER.

01:30.905 --> 01:32.871
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
GO ANYWHERE?

01:32.873 --> 01:36.407
AREN'T YOU HAPPY WITH ME?

01:36.409 --> 01:38.575
KNOCK IT OFF,
IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY.

01:38.577 --> 01:42.945
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE YA THREE HOURS.
AND BRING ME BACK AN AUGGIE BAG.

OKAY, DEAL.
ALL RIGHT.

01:45.549 --> 01:48.516
SO HOW ABOUT SHELLY
FROM DOWN THE STREET?

01:48.518 --> 01:50.284
SMELLY SHELLY?

01:51.553 --> 01:53.519
HE'S RIGHT.

01:53.521 --> 01:55.020
HOW ABOUT ANNA STEPHONOPOLI?

01:55.022 --> 01:57.956
"WANNA PLAY MONOPOLY?"
NO, ANNA, I DON'T.

01:57.958 --> 01:59.524
OKAY?  I DON'T.

02:01.327 --> 02:03.927
I'M LATE, I'M LATE,
I KNOW I'M LATE!

02:03.929 --> 02:06.562
- SEVEN MINUTES.
- SAY NOTHING.  KEEP WALKING.

02:06.564 --> 02:09.765
NO.  THIS IS A THING.

02:09.767 --> 02:12.467
DEAL WITH YOUR BAD GIRL.

02:12.469 --> 02:17.004
- OKAY, WHERE WERE YOU?
- DEMOLITION.

02:17.006 --> 02:20.306
IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE STORE.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.275
WHERE REBELS GO!

02:25.444 --> 02:26.743
AND I BOUGHT THIS T-SHIRT

02:26.745 --> 02:30.646
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL
ENTIRELY APPROVE OF.  BLEH!

02:32.950 --> 02:34.883
EDGY.

02:34.885 --> 02:37.418
UH, RILEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:37.420 --> 02:40.754
I AM TOO OLD FOR A
SEVEN O'CLOCK CURFEW.

02:40.756 --> 02:41.921
I REJECT IT!

02:41.923 --> 02:46.424
REJECT IT!  REJECT IT!
WON'T EVEN RESPECT IT!

02:46.426 --> 02:48.793
DIDN'T MAKE
THE TEAM AGAIN, HUH?

02:48.795 --> 02:51.629
NO!

02:51.631 --> 02:53.530
EVERY YEAR.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.865
OKAY, LOOK, RILEY,

02:56.867 --> 02:58.700
YOUR FATHER AND I GAVE YOU
A 7:00 CURFEW

02:58.702 --> 03:01.069
BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT
EVEN WHEN YOU GOT
ALL REBELLIOUS

03:01.071 --> 03:03.037
YOU'D STILL BE HOME

OF BAD INFLUENCE ARE YOU?

03:24.388 --> 03:26.988
YOU'RE RIGHT.

AS MORE OF A GROWN-UP.

05:29.455 --> 05:31.955
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- DEFINE "GROWN-UP."

05:31.957 --> 05:34.924
I CAN GO BUY T-SHIRTS
WHENEVER I WANT.

05:34.926 --> 05:37.026
AND HOW DO YOU MAKE
THE MONEY TO DO THAT?

05:37.028 --> 05:39.428
I DON'T HAVE TO.
I'M A KID.

05:39.430 --> 05:42.664
RILEY, GROWN-UPS HAVE
RESPONSIBILITIES.

05:42.666 --> 05:44.932
IDEA IDEA IDEA!
IDEA IDEA IDEA!

05:44.934 --> 05:46.900
WHAT'S THE MATTER, AUGGIE?

05:46.902 --> 05:49.202
IS NO ONE BELIEVING
THAT THE LITTLE KID
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE AN IDEA

05:49.204 --> 05:51.437
ABOUT HOW WE COULD
RAISE OUR OLDER CHILD?

05:51.439 --> 05:54.807
LET RILEY BE MY BABYSITTER.

OF RESPONSIBILITY?

06:11.188 --> 06:13.588
I WOULD PUT MY LIFE
IN HER HANDS.

RILEY MAKES ME SMILEY.

06:40.144 --> 06:43.145
SO, HOW'D YOU GET MOMMY
TO GO OUT WITH YOU?

06:43.147 --> 06:46.047
WE'RE MARRIED.
SHE HAS TO.

06:46.049 --> 06:48.082
SHOULD I GET
MARRIED SOMEDAY?

06:48.084 --> 06:49.950
IF YOU FIND SOMEBODY
LIKE MOMMY.

06:49.952 --> 06:54.654

06:59.593 --> 07:03.560
ONE BUNNY EAR GOES
OVER THE OTHER BUNNY EAR.

07:03.562 --> 07:08.097
- HOW DO I LOOK?
- LIKE A SHOE.

07:08.099 --> 07:11.032
GREAT.
MAMA LOVES SHOES.

07:13.169 --> 07:16.670

YEAH, BUT NOT WITH THE BAM!
AND THE BOOM!

07:32.084 --> 07:34.350
AND THE... YOU KNOW.

LOVE THE WAY YOU LOOK.

07:38.155 --> 07:39.905
THANK YOU, HONEY.

07:39.906 --> 07:41.656
BUT YOU WANT TO KNOW
ONE OF THE REASONS I
MARRIED YOUR FATHER?

07:41.658 --> 07:44.257
- YEAH.
- HE LOVES ME
NO MATTER HOW I LOOK.

07:45.727 --> 07:46.792
( chuckles )

07:50.230 --> 07:54.364

08:16.117 --> 08:18.784
DEAL.

08:18.786 --> 08:21.753
AW, LOOK AT YOU TWO,
ALL DRESSED UP.

08:21.755 --> 08:23.654

CARRIAGE AND A PLAY.

MAN, YOU JUST CAN'T GET
OUT OF HERE WITHOUT THE
LIFE LESSON THING, CAN YA?

09:02.289 --> 09:04.822
OH, PLEASE, LIKE I HAD
SOMETHING PLANNED.

09:04.824 --> 09:06.123
( laughs )

09:06.125 --> 09:08.058
SAY HELLO TO YOUR
NEW BEST FRIEND.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.160

09:31.144 --> 09:32.276
'CAUSE I'VE SEEN THIS.

NOT THE WAY
WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

09:34.079 --> 09:36.079
YEAH, THERE'S
A BIG TWIST AT THE END.

09:36.081 --> 09:39.415
SO, UH, TELL US
ABOUT YOUR NEW FRIEND, RILEY.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.884
WHAT ARE HER HOPES,
WHAT ARE HER DREAMS?

09:41.886 --> 09:44.887
AMANDA MAKES
FRIENDS VERY EASILY.

09:44.889 --> 09:47.089
EVERYBODY LIKES HER.
SHE'S A GOOD EGG.

09:48.492 --> 09:51.259
WE'RE GOING TO GO BACKPACKING
THROUGH EUROPE SOMEDAY.

09:51.261 --> 09:55.195
WOW.  OKAY, WELL, BEFORE
YOU DO, MAY I HOLD HER?

09:55.197 --> 09:57.997

THANK YOU, AMANDA.
THAT'S VERY SWEET.

10:09.774 --> 10:10.839
DO IT.

10:13.143 --> 10:17.111
( in normal voice )
NO!  WHAT IS THE POINT
OF THIS HORRIBLE LESSON?

10:18.814 --> 10:21.080
THIS IS AN EGG
YOU KNEW FOR A MINUTE.

10:21.082 --> 10:23.882
WE'RE GIVING YOU
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR OUR CHILD.

10:23.884 --> 10:27.184
WE ALL LOVE HIM.
DON'T DROP HIM.

10:29.021 --> 10:31.421
- SO, CLEAN AMANDA UP
AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT!
- BYE!

10:34.959 --> 10:36.525
YOU'RE MY REAL BROTHER!

10:36.527 --> 10:40.094
I CAN'T BREATHE!

10:42.998 --> 10:45.999

10:52.374 --> 10:55.007
SO, I GET

10:55.009 --> 10:57.175
IT'LL 'SPLODE YOUR BRAIN!

10:57.177 --> 11:00.211
- ( intercom buzzes )
- Maya: <i> What up, weirdoes?</i>

11:00.213 --> 11:02.880
- MAYA!
- MAYA?

11:02.882 --> 11:05.349
EVERY BABYSITTER NEEDS
A BABYSITTER'S BEST FRIEND.

11:05.351 --> 11:09.219
- COME ON UP!
- SHE SHOULDN'T BE HERE
ON OUR NIGHT.

11:09.221 --> 11:11.321
WHY CAN'T IT BE
OUR NIGHT WITH MAYA?

11:11.323 --> 11:13.156
I HAVEN'T SHOWED YOU MY ROOM.

11:13.158 --> 11:15.024
- "RED PLANET DIARIES!"
- OOH!

11:15.026 --> 11:16.492
TONIGHT'S THE SEASON FINALE!

I'M GOING TO MY ROOM NOW.
RILEY, ARE YOU COMING?

11:50.488 --> 11:52.221
YEAH YEAH,
JUST GIMME A SEC.

12:13.410 --> 12:17.078
WHERE'S THE TRAIN?
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR DINNER.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.081
Man over PA:
<i> ...broken down,</i>
<i> all trains half hour late.</i>

12:21.083 --> 12:22.982
- THANK YOU.
- PA: <i> Thank you.</i>

12:26.020 --> 12:27.219
MAYBE WE CAN GET A CAB?

12:32.225 --> 12:33.857
NOPE.

12:33.859 --> 12:35.391
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO MISS OUR CARRIAGE RIDE.

12:35.393 --> 12:39.394
NO HORSEYS?
BUT IT'S OUR "NANOVERSARY."

12:39.396 --> 12:41.663
WE'VE BEEN
MARRIED FIFTEEN YEARS.

12:41.664 --> 12:43.931
THAT'S THE LONGEST ANYONE HAS
EVER BEEN MARRIED TO A TOPANGA.

12:45.901 --> 12:49.002
I WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A NIGHT OF ROMANCE AND MUSIC.

12:49.004 --> 12:52.372
<i> ( synthesizer music playing )</i>

13:03.918 --> 13:06.351
THAT'S REALLY VERY GOOD.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.653
I APPRECIATE IT.

13:08.655 --> 13:12.289
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
DOING THIS FOR A LIVING.

13:12.291 --> 13:16.159
THANK YOU FOR
CHANGING MY LIFE.

13:16.161 --> 13:18.528
IT'S REALLY A BEAUTIFUL SONG.
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?

13:18.530 --> 13:21.097
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- TOPANGA.

13:21.099 --> 13:25.033
- MY NAME'S CORY.
- I'M CALLING IT "TOPANGA."

13:26.503 --> 13:27.568
THANK YOU.
( chuckles )

13:30.639 --> 13:32.538
Female voice:
<i> Oh, Blarg's other head,</i>

13:32.540 --> 13:35.440
<i>if only we could</i>
<i>run off together, without...</i>

13:35.442 --> 13:39.210
<i> - You know...</i>
<i> - </i> Male voice on TV:
<i> Actually, there is a way.</i>

13:39.212 --> 13:40.544
<i> ( woman gasps )</i>
<i> What is it?!</i>

13:40.546 --> 13:42.579
- Both: WHAT IS IT?
- <i> ( TV clicks off )</i>

13:42.581 --> 13:45.214
- Both: NO!
- NO MORE TV!

13:45.216 --> 13:48.183
- AUGGIE, WE WERE WATCHING THAT.
- GIVE IT BACK, RUNT!

13:48.185 --> 13:49.384
YOU'RE A RUNT!

13:49.386 --> 13:52.987
AND YOU'RE THE WORST BABYSITTER
IN THE WORLD!

13:54.190 --> 13:57.357
YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH TV
WHEN YOU BABYSIT YOUR BROTHER!

13:57.359 --> 14:01.527
AUGGIE, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING WITH THAT?

14:01.529 --> 14:05.397
I'M GOING TO THROW IT
OUT THE WINDOW!

14:05.399 --> 14:07.565
- YOU WOULDN'T DARE.
- I WILL DO IT!

14:07.567 --> 14:09.633
I WILL DO IT, LADY!

14:12.170 --> 14:14.370
AWW, LOOK AT THOSE TWO.

14:14.372 --> 14:16.572
<i> YOU THINK IT'S THEIR</i>
<i> "NANOVERSARY"?</i>

14:16.574 --> 14:18.440
THINK SHE KISSED HIM
UP AGAINST THE LOCKERS

14:18.442 --> 14:20.074
WHILE THEY WERE
HANDCUFFED TOGETHER?

14:31.052 --> 14:34.520
HEH, WELL, THAT
WOULD MAKE THEM A
VERY EXCITING COUPLE.

14:34.522 --> 14:37.990
OH, THEY ARE.
AND THEN SHE PROPOSED TO HIM.

14:37.992 --> 14:39.091
AT THEIR GRADUATION.

14:39.093 --> 14:41.193
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

14:46.333 --> 14:48.466
AND HE WAS VERY SMART
AND SAID YES.

14:48.468 --> 14:50.100
AND THEY LIVED
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

14:50.102 --> 14:52.235
UNTIL THEIR
FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY.

14:52.237 --> 14:54.036
WHEN THE SUBWAY
DIDN'T COME.

14:54.038 --> 14:57.272
EXCEPT GOOD THINGS COME
WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT.

14:57.274 --> 15:00.008
LIKE MAYBE I GOT THAT BRACELET
YOU HAD YOUR EYE ON
IN MY POCKET.

15:00.010 --> 15:02.710
- REALLY?
- NO.

15:02.712 --> 15:04.378
RING MADE OF CANDY.

15:08.050 --> 15:09.516
CORY?

15:09.518 --> 15:13.386
TOPANGA MATTHEWS,
WILL YOU MARRY ME AGAIN?

15:13.388 --> 15:16.988
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

15:16.990 --> 15:18.556
MMM! MMM!

15:18.558 --> 15:19.623
BLUE RASPBERRY!

15:23.028 --> 15:24.994
- OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

15:24.996 --> 15:27.296
WHO NEEDS A PLAY?
WE'RE IN OUR OWN.

15:27.298 --> 15:30.032
- ( chuckles )
- THE ONLY THING WE
DIDN'T GET WAS--

15:33.637 --> 15:35.370
HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE.

15:35.371 --> 15:37.104
EXCUSE ME.  UM, IT'S OUR
ANNIVERSARY AND WE'RE WEIRD.

15:37.107 --> 15:39.240
COULD I BORROW
YOUR HORSEY FOR A MINUTE?

15:41.444 --> 15:42.676
THANK YOU.

15:42.678 --> 15:45.645
- M'LADY?
- DON'T MIND IF I DO.

15:50.551 --> 15:54.185
HO!  OKAY OKAY!  OKAY!

15:54.187 --> 15:57.087
THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.

15:58.256 --> 16:00.356
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT
COULD MAKE THIS NIGHT BETTER.

16:00.358 --> 16:03.526
- YOU MISS THE KIDS?
- I DO.

16:03.528 --> 16:06.128
I DO TOO.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.213
LET'S GO HOME AND SPY ON 'EM!

16:08.214 --> 16:10.297
SHOULDN'T WE TRUST
RILEY AND AUGGIE THAT
NOTHING WILL GO WRONG?

16:10.300 --> 16:12.433
( both laugh loudly )

16:12.435 --> 16:14.168
LET'S GO HOME
AND SPY ON THE KIDS!

16:21.176 --> 16:23.843
Auggie:
<i> YOU'RE THE WORST</i>
<i> BABYSITTER IN THE WORLD!</i>

16:23.845 --> 16:25.545
Riley:
<i> YOU'RE THE WORST</i>
<i> BABY IN THE WORLD!</i>

16:25.546 --> 16:27.246
- SO WE JUMP IN NOW?
- NO, WE HAVE FAITH THAT

16:27.248 --> 16:30.782
SHE'S GONNA HANDLE THIS LIKE
A MATURE ADULT, LIKE WE ARE.

16:30.784 --> 16:32.383
Maya:
YOU TURNED IT OFF
AT THE BEST PART.

16:32.385 --> 16:35.652
EASY THERE,
PUT THE REMOTE DOWN
NICE AND EASY

16:35.654 --> 16:39.655
- AND NOBODY GETS HURT, BUDDY.
- YOU'RE NOT MY BUDDY.

16:39.657 --> 16:42.858
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.594
AUGGIE, WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH YOU?

16:45.596 --> 16:47.696
YOU'RE WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH ME.

16:47.698 --> 16:50.665
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYA?
YOU CAN HAVE RILEY.

16:50.667 --> 16:53.901
SHE'D RATHER BE WITH YOU ANYWAY.
SHE'S YOUR SISTER NOW.

16:55.504 --> 16:58.238
- AUGGIE!
- THIS IS THE WORST NIGHT EVER!

17:08.683 --> 17:11.550
- HI, BUDDY.
- HAVING FUN?

17:11.552 --> 17:13.852
ARE YOU HOME?

17:13.854 --> 17:15.787
WHY ARE YOU NOT FIXING THIS?

17:15.789 --> 17:18.923
BECAUSE, AUGGIE, RILEY
WANTS RESPONSIBILITY.

17:18.925 --> 17:21.225
AND IT'S IMPORTANT
TO LET HER TRY.

17:21.227 --> 17:23.227
SHE HAS FAILED.

17:23.229 --> 17:25.529
WE BELIEVE
THAT SHE WON'T FAIL.

17:25.531 --> 17:27.564
TOO LATE.
GO YELL AT HER.

17:27.566 --> 17:29.232
YOU'RE REALLY
MAD AT HER, HUH?

17:29.234 --> 17:30.466
I GAVE HER TO MAYA,

17:30.468 --> 17:32.501
BECAUSE SHE'S BAD
BABYSITTER RILEY.

17:32.503 --> 17:35.971
I KNOW THAT DOESN'T RHYME,
BUT I'M JUST SO MAD!

17:35.973 --> 17:39.274
AUGGIE, IT MAY
SEEM BAD RIGHT NOW,

17:39.276 --> 17:42.477
BUT I'LL MAKE YOU A BET--
YOU'RE GONNA WANT HER BACK.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.546
FINE.  YOU LOSE,
YOU MAKE ME A BROTHER.

17:47.683 --> 17:49.916
- DEAL.
- ( laughs ) HOLD ON.

17:49.918 --> 17:53.685
FIRST WE'RE GONNA GIVE
HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE
A GOOD BABYSITTER, OKAY?

17:53.687 --> 17:55.920
THEN BROTHER?

17:55.922 --> 17:58.422
BROTHER ANYWAY.

17:58.424 --> 18:01.792
NOW WE'LL NEVER KNOW
IF ASHLEY THE ASTRONAUT ENDS UP

18:01.794 --> 18:04.594
WITH BLARG
OR BLARG'S OTHER HEAD.

18:04.596 --> 18:06.562
GEE, IF ONLY SOMETHING
EXISTED

18:06.564 --> 18:10.332
WHERE WE COULD TYPE IN
A FEW WORDS AND...

18:10.334 --> 18:12.400
IT'S NOT THE SAME!

18:12.402 --> 18:16.904
WE WERE REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO THIS NIGHT
AND AUGGIE RUINED IT.

18:16.906 --> 18:19.940
I THINK AUGGIE COULD SAY THE
SAME THING ABOUT ME, RILEY.

18:19.942 --> 18:22.442
HE JUST WANTED
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

18:22.444 --> 18:23.910
YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE THAT.

18:23.912 --> 18:27.480
I KNOW.  IT'S LIKE WE DON'T
PAY ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE

18:27.482 --> 18:29.815
WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT US.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.917
LADIES!

18:31.919 --> 18:34.019
GET LOST, FARKLE, WE CAN'T
PAY ATTENTION TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

18:34.021 --> 18:37.288
BUT I FEEL LIKE WHEN
WE DON'T HAVE SCHOOL
I'M NOT EVEN PART OF THE STORY.

18:38.758 --> 18:41.525
THERE'S SOMEONE WHO REALLY
CARES ABOUT ME,

18:41.527 --> 18:44.661
AND I'M NOT LETTING HIM KNOW
THAT I CARE ABOUT HIM TOO.

18:44.663 --> 18:47.563
OOH, MAYBE I AM
PART OF THE STORY.

18:47.565 --> 18:51.033
AND I REALLY
LOVE THE LITTLE GUY.

18:51.035 --> 18:54.302
AND ALL HE WANTED TO DO
WAS SHOW ME HIS ROOM.

18:54.304 --> 18:56.037
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

18:59.675 --> 19:01.374
I GOTTA GO TALK TO AUGGIE.

19:05.045 --> 19:07.011
WELL WELL, ALONE AT LAST.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.346
YES, YOU ARE.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.816
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

19:17.421 --> 19:20.321
OKAY, MR. GOOGLY.
YOU'RE MY SISTER NOW.

19:20.323 --> 19:24.324
Riley:
<i>BUT DON'T YOU WANT TO</i>
<i>GIVE RILEY ONE MORE CHANCE?</i>

19:24.326 --> 19:26.426
NO, IT'S YOU AND ME!

19:27.695 --> 19:29.560
OH, IT'S YOU.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.063
I WENT INTO YOUR ROOM
LOOKING FOR YOU.

19:34.065 --> 19:37.999
I SAW WHAT YOU DID.
I'M SO SORRY.

19:38.001 --> 19:40.501
IT COULD'VE BEEN
THE BEST NIGHT EVER.

19:40.503 --> 19:43.570
- MAYBE IT STILL CAN BE.
- HOW?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.512
ARRGH!

19:54.514 --> 19:56.981
HOW DID YOU DO THIS?!

19:56.983 --> 19:58.900
DEMOLITION.

19:58.901 --> 20:00.818
OPEN LATE TONIGHT
AND I HAVE NO CURFEW AT ALL.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.520
NOW, WHERE'S ALL
YOUR TREASURE, MATEY?

20:03.522 --> 20:05.921
WE'RE BEING BOARDED
BY BLONDEBEARD!

20:07.991 --> 20:11.691
( grunting )

20:11.693 --> 20:14.060
OH!

20:14.062 --> 20:16.529
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
STICK AROUND TONIGHT, AUGGIE.

20:16.531 --> 20:18.531
YOU'RE NOT SUCH A BAD PIRATE.

20:19.734 --> 20:23.736
SO, CAN WE KEEP HER?

20:23.738 --> 20:26.738
YEAH. BUT YOU AND ME ARE
BROTHER AND SISTER AGAIN.

20:28.475 --> 20:31.342
- THEN WHO AM I?
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO WALKS THE PLANK!

20:31.344 --> 20:33.344
I CAN'T SWIM!

20:37.349 --> 20:38.548
YOU WIN.

20:38.550 --> 20:42.451
- NO BROTHER?
- NO.  I'M THE BROTHER.

20:44.721 --> 20:48.388
- HA!
- HA!  HA!

20:48.390 --> 20:51.457
BEST ANNIVERSARY NIGHT EVER.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.859
YOU, ME AND THE KIDS.

20:54.828 --> 20:56.394
AND FARKLE.

20:57.830 --> 21:00.130
DO IT.

21:00.132 --> 21:02.966
( gasps )
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

21:12.911 --> 21:14.977
- SMELLS GOOD.
- WHAT ARE WE HAVING?

21:14.979 --> 21:18.679
CORY'S BREAKFAST SPECIAL--
SCRAMBLED EGGS!

21:18.681 --> 21:19.980
SERIOUSLY?

21:19.982 --> 21:23.082
YOU COOKED THE ENTIRE
McSCRAMBLEFACE FAMILY?

21:24.652 --> 21:26.585
YEAH.  YUM YUM.
EAT 'EM UP.

21:26.587 --> 21:29.888
THAT WAS AMANDA'S BEST FRIEND.

21:29.890 --> 21:32.657
SHE USED TO COME IN THROUGH
HER BEDROOM WINDOW EVERY NIGHT,

21:32.659 --> 21:34.992
AND THEY'D TALK FOR HOURS.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.493
OKAY.

21:38.063 --> 21:41.531
THAT WAS MAMA McSCRAMBLEFACE.

21:41.533 --> 21:43.766
<i> SHE USED TO LOOK WOW.</i>

21:49.039 --> 21:50.538
WHO'D I GET?

21:50.540 --> 21:53.574
YOU GOT BABY BROTHER
McSCRAMBLEFACE.

21:53.576 --> 21:54.942
HE WAS MY FAVORITE.

21:54.944 --> 21:57.744
YOU MONSTER.

21:59.147 --> 22:01.480
- OUT FOR PANCAKES?
- ( all cheer )
