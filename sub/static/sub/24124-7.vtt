WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.833
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.708 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I gotta be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.208
Winnie the Pooh

01:11.750 --> 01:13.375
Honey.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.083
Can't wait 'til breakfast.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.833
I shall have some honey.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.125
Honey.

01:33.125 --> 01:37.000
I think
my tummy's reminding me
it's time for breakfast.

01:41.708 --> 01:42.875
Oh, bother.

01:44.458 --> 01:46.583
Empty.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.458
My tummy must have gotten
hungrily,

01:51.458 --> 01:55.083
and walked me in my sleep.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.958
But then,
why am I still hungry?

01:59.458 --> 02:01.333
A trail.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.083
Perhaps it will lead me
to some answers.

02:06.625 --> 02:09.166
Or some more honey.

02:13.208 --> 02:14.750
Stop shovin'.

02:17.583 --> 02:21.291
Hm. My tummy must have
gone under there to eat.

02:21.291 --> 02:24.583
So as not to disturb
my sleep.

02:25.875 --> 02:30.291
With no honey
and an empty tummy,

02:30.291 --> 02:32.958
there's only one thing to do.

02:32.958 --> 02:35.166
Borrow some more honey
from Rabbit.

02:35.166 --> 02:36.166
Yum.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.166
Achoo!

02:49.166 --> 02:51.000
Man 1: Uh,gesundheit.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
Ah, thank you.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.708
Who-- Who said that?

02:56.708 --> 02:59.208
- Man 1: Nobody, I--
-

02:59.208 --> 03:01.458
Man 2: Be quiet, hose nose.

03:05.166 --> 03:07.833
All right,
come out and fight.

03:07.833 --> 03:10.000
Like--
Like whatever you are.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.416
Hey!

03:11.416 --> 03:15.500
Roo, uh, whatever
are you doing, dear?

03:15.500 --> 03:19.625
Mama, there's something
under my bed.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.875
Oh, probably just
one of your dreams

03:22.875 --> 03:24.250
waiting to pounce.

03:24.250 --> 03:28.625
No, I wasn't nightmaring.
Honest.

03:28.625 --> 03:31.625
These things are alive,
sort of.

03:31.625 --> 03:34.625
And they have long tails
or somethin'.

03:34.625 --> 03:38.125
- And-- and--
- Probably just mice, dear.

03:38.125 --> 03:40.458
Did you hear that, Stan?

03:40.458 --> 03:44.166
Mice. Big mice.

03:44.166 --> 03:45.958
Save me, Stan,
save me.

03:45.958 --> 03:48.375
Not real mice,
cucumber brain.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.375
They think we're mice.

03:50.375 --> 03:53.458
Now pipe down and let's
find some more honey.

03:53.458 --> 03:56.083
I certainly hope Rabbit
has enough honey

03:56.083 --> 03:59.000
for this appetite
I'm working up.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.291
Oh. Hello, Piglet.

04:01.291 --> 04:02.583
Why, hello, Pooh.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.875
I was just
coming to see you.

04:04.875 --> 04:08.000
I was hoping
you'd say that.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.291
Why, Piglet,
this honey pot is...

04:11.291 --> 04:13.375
empty.

04:13.375 --> 04:14.750
I know it is, Pooh.

04:14.750 --> 04:18.500
I was coming to ask
if you emptied it.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.875
I give up, Piglet.
Did I?

04:20.875 --> 04:24.083
Well, if you didn't,
something else did.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.416
In which case,

04:25.416 --> 04:28.333
I'm going to have to be
very frightened.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.583
Oh, there's nothing
to worry about, Piglet.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.458
We can both borrow more honey
from Rabbit.

04:36.416 --> 04:38.833
-

04:40.875 --> 04:42.708
Uh, perhaps we should
come back

04:42.708 --> 04:46.291
when Rabbit isn't feeling
so  loud.

04:46.291 --> 04:49.000
Hello, Rabbit.
Wait.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Please don't bother me now,
Pooh Bear.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.333
I have to go and give you
a piece of my mind.

04:56.333 --> 04:57.958
Pooh Bear.

04:57.958 --> 05:00.583
Why are you sneaking in,

05:00.583 --> 05:02.083
and eating all my honey?

05:02.083 --> 05:04.375
Don't I lend you enough?

05:04.375 --> 05:08.250
And perhaps you can tell us
what happened to our honey.

05:08.250 --> 05:13.000
Have I truly eaten
everyone's honey?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
Can't you remember,
Pooh?

05:15.000 --> 05:16.750
Why, I do remember.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.958
And then
when I try to remember,

05:19.958 --> 05:21.291
I forget.

05:21.291 --> 05:24.125
I don't think
it was you, Pooh.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.375
I think it was those mice.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.500
Whoops!

05:29.500 --> 05:33.166
Ahh, there you are,
you honeynapper.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.958
All right,
where'd you stash it?

05:35.958 --> 05:38.875
You see?
Pooh must be the thief.

05:40.291 --> 05:43.500
Oh. When was your honey
swiped, Gopher?

05:43.500 --> 05:46.625
Just this minute.
Why'd you ask?

05:46.625 --> 05:50.833
Aha. Aha!
You did do it!

05:50.833 --> 05:53.458
But Rabbit,
I am--

05:53.458 --> 05:54.833
Was--

05:54.833 --> 05:58.708
I are here with you
just-- just this minute.

05:58.708 --> 06:02.333
So, you did not take
Gopher's honey.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.375
Huh?

06:03.375 --> 06:05.000
I told ya.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.500
It was those
bed bouncing mice.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.333
Oh, why, that's right.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.708
My bed was bounced, too.

06:11.708 --> 06:13.875
And mine, too.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.333
Say, so was mine.

06:16.333 --> 06:19.458
We're gonna have to
catch 'em.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.875
We are?

06:22.875 --> 06:26.708
Yes! We'll
catch those mice like--

06:26.708 --> 06:27.958
Like mice.

06:27.958 --> 06:31.291
Or my name's not
Winnie the Pooh.

06:31.291 --> 06:33.875
Which it is.
So there you are.

06:35.166 --> 06:38.500
And there you are.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.708
The mouse traps are set.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.250
Now, follow me.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.750
Uh, Pooh boy,
where are we goin'?

06:45.750 --> 06:48.083
To keep watch,
of course.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.750
- Pooh. Pooh.

07:15.125 --> 07:17.875
I don't think
this is working.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.875
Uh, maybe we should
keep watch from...

07:20.875 --> 07:25.000
some place more
"inconspickerous."

07:30.333 --> 07:33.250
Uh, perhaps we should
pretend to be asleep?

07:33.250 --> 07:35.000
Remember, kiddikins,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.333
you let us big guys
handle those...

07:37.333 --> 07:40.333
giant... mouses.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.458
Good. They're asleep.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.333
Let's get the honey.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.875
Honey?

07:52.875 --> 07:55.583
Shh!

07:55.583 --> 07:58.833
And watch out for
the mouse traps.

07:58.833 --> 08:00.458
Mice! Mice!

08:00.458 --> 08:02.958
Oh, no!
Mice!

08:02.958 --> 08:04.625
Get 'em away.
Oh, save me, Stan.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.000
Save me.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.625
There are no mice.

08:07.625 --> 08:09.583
The traps are for us.

08:09.583 --> 08:12.833
Uh, for us?

08:12.833 --> 08:14.000
What a relief.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.166
- Ahh!

08:19.208 --> 08:22.000
Eh, how come you got one?
I didn't get one.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
- Can I have one?
-

08:24.000 --> 08:26.583
Ow! Ooh. Hoo. Ow!

08:26.583 --> 08:28.833
Ooh! Ooh-hoo!
Ooh!

08:33.625 --> 08:36.625
Roo: I told ya.
They're really big mice.

08:36.625 --> 08:39.208
And we need
a really big trap.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.458
And some really big bait.

08:46.708 --> 08:49.458
And then the wagon
with the cake

08:49.458 --> 08:51.708
rolls down the ramp,

08:51.708 --> 08:53.000
and trips the rope,

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
which drops the wash tub
right onto the mice.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.083
Oh, boy, that's great!

08:59.083 --> 09:01.166
Pooh,
that's the funniest--

09:01.166 --> 09:03.166
But what's the cake for?

09:03.166 --> 09:06.583
Well, everyone knows that
after you yell surprise,

09:06.583 --> 09:08.083
you blow out the candles.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.333
But where's
the bait, Pooh?

09:12.333 --> 09:14.583
Ta-da!

09:14.583 --> 09:15.750
Gang way.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.166
What are you doing, Tigger?

09:18.166 --> 09:21.500
Well, you can't have cake
without icy cream.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.625
Whoops.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.875
Piglet: Well,
the trap worked, Pooh.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.958
Come on.
Now's our chance.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.208
Look. Those aren't mice.

09:37.208 --> 09:40.750
- They're--
- Heffalumps and woozles.

09:40.750 --> 09:43.708
Hi-ho, heffalumps.

09:43.708 --> 09:45.875
- Woo, away!
- Roo: Get 'em.

09:54.375 --> 09:56.708
They're
running out of gas, guys.

09:56.708 --> 09:57.833
We got 'em!

09:59.291 --> 10:03.458
All right, no more
mister nice woozle.

10:03.458 --> 10:06.583
Uh, show 'em
what you're made of,
buddy bear.

10:06.583 --> 10:07.708
Fluff.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.250
I think we're in big trouble.

10:09.958 --> 10:11.833
Oh, bother.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.958
Ahh! I'd like to see ya
try that again.

10:14.958 --> 10:18.083
Maybe I shouldn't have asked.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.875
One.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.291
Uh, two.

10:22.291 --> 10:24.083
Three.

10:24.083 --> 10:29.000
Um-- Uh-- Duh,
what come after three?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.625
Uh, four?

10:30.625 --> 10:33.458
Whoa!

10:33.458 --> 10:35.500
That showed 'em.

10:35.500 --> 10:38.333
Now all the honey
is ours.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.958
Wait a minute.

10:39.958 --> 10:42.875
You can't do that,

10:42.875 --> 10:45.583
you-- you big bullies.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.750
Uh, a mouse.

10:47.750 --> 10:50.583
A-a-a giant mouse!

10:50.583 --> 10:51.583
Ooh-hoo-ah-ha!

10:51.583 --> 10:54.166
I hate it when he does that.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.625
Please get me
out of his path.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.583
Please. Pretty please.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.750
You may have won
this round, fluff brains,

11:03.750 --> 11:06.875
but we'll be back
with friends.

11:06.875 --> 11:11.625
And then we'll get you
and your big mouse, too.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.166
Yeah! We did it!

11:14.166 --> 11:15.875
"Absoposilutely."

11:15.875 --> 11:17.875
We showed those "villians"
a thing or three.

11:17.875 --> 11:22.166
And I guess
this little nipper
was right after all.

11:22.166 --> 11:27.250
And now our honey will be safe
to "smackerel" in peace.

11:27.708 --> 11:29.000
Ooh!

11:31.875 --> 11:33.250
Will it?

11:33.250 --> 11:35.458
They said they'd be back,

11:35.458 --> 11:38.458
with f-f-f-friends.

11:58.750 --> 11:59.833
Yes?

11:59.833 --> 12:02.250
Aha! Just as I thought.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.250
Do you open your door
to just anybody?

12:05.250 --> 12:08.375
Well, if anybody's name
is Rabbit.

12:08.375 --> 12:11.375
Well, Pooh,
you are totally unready,

12:11.375 --> 12:13.708
unsteady and unprepared.

12:13.708 --> 12:17.708
What are you going to do
when those heffalumps
and woozles return?

12:17.708 --> 12:20.416
Why can't we just
invite them to breakfast,

12:20.416 --> 12:23.000
and share our honey?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.875
What?! Have breakfast
with icky,

12:25.875 --> 12:28.708
nasty heffalumps
and woozles?

12:28.708 --> 12:31.000
Give them our honey?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.458
Well, you share with me,

12:33.458 --> 12:35.708
and I share with you...

12:35.708 --> 12:37.333
when there's any left.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.291
Oh, you're our friend, Pooh,

12:39.291 --> 12:42.333
but heffalumps
and woozles are...

12:43.583 --> 12:47.083
heffalumps and woozles.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.583
Perhaps they just
don't know any better.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.083
Well, it's time
someone educated them.

12:52.083 --> 12:53.750
Stand back, you guys.

12:53.750 --> 12:56.625
Old Tigger's gonna
learn 'em a thing or two.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.250
Go get 'em, Tigger.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.583
Let go!
Let go!

13:05.583 --> 13:08.458
Oh! Ooh! Hey,
no fair sneakin' up.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.583
Oh, boy,
you should have seen it.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.083
I smooshed 'em.
And I "massacreed" 'em.

13:15.083 --> 13:19.125
No "heffabump"
can sneak up on a Tigger
and get away with it.

13:19.125 --> 13:22.958
I think you smooshed
my laundry, Tigger.

13:24.333 --> 13:27.875
Nah, it can't be.
Look at this.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.000
A heffalump trunk warmer.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.500
No. I believe
it's a sock, Tigger.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.125
Uh, well, it shouldn't have
jumped out at me.

13:45.833 --> 13:48.708
For the last time,
sponge head,

13:48.708 --> 13:50.500
we're gonna get help.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.500
Yeah?

13:52.500 --> 13:56.875
But who's big enough
to take on that
"gigantical" mouse?

13:56.875 --> 13:59.875
We're gonna get Wooster.

13:59.875 --> 14:03.000
Wooster!

14:03.000 --> 14:04.708
Oh, Stan,

14:04.708 --> 14:06.375
let's go back to
the mountains.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.625
- Hold it.
- Oh, please.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.625
- Why--
-

14:15.833 --> 14:17.875
Gopher!

14:17.875 --> 14:19.875
Yoo-hoo!

14:19.875 --> 14:21.708
Perhaps he's down here.

14:21.708 --> 14:22.875
Oops!

14:22.875 --> 14:24.250
Oh, bother.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.708
Well, don't just stand there
wiggling your ears, sonny.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.708
Speak your piece.

14:31.708 --> 14:32.875
Excuse me, Gopher.

14:32.875 --> 14:34.625
Ahh!

14:34.625 --> 14:38.375
Uh, don't you know any better
than to sneak up on people

14:38.375 --> 14:41.250
when there's "weffalumps"
and "hoozles" around?

14:41.250 --> 14:43.250
Heffalumps and woozles.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.708
Eh, whatever.

14:44.708 --> 14:47.125
That's exactly
why we need you.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.500
Oh?

14:48.500 --> 14:51.416
We need you to
fortify Pooh's house.

14:51.416 --> 14:55.000
Well,
why didn't ya say so.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.750
Rabbit.
Gopher?

14:58.750 --> 15:01.208
Oh, bother, bother.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.875
Let's go back to
the mountains.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.125
Oh, please.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.875
Wooster!

15:12.875 --> 15:15.583
We know where there's
some honey to steal.

15:17.583 --> 15:21.875
Uh, maybe he's not home.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.458
I hope.

15:24.875 --> 15:28.208
Honey.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.166
Great.
Follow me, Wooster.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.000
Ahh.
It's just after breakfast.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
And not quite lunch.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.875
The perfect time for
a little brunchfast.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.458
Oof!

15:43.083 --> 15:45.583
Gopher: Well,
what do you think, sonny?

15:45.583 --> 15:49.291
No "heffamagoat" is gonna
get through this baby.

15:49.291 --> 15:52.416
But Gopher,
what if they walk around it?

15:52.416 --> 15:55.166
What? Around it?

15:55.166 --> 15:57.583
Around it?!

15:57.583 --> 15:59.125
Uh, confound it,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.708
nobody gave me
the specifications.

16:01.708 --> 16:03.875
I gotta think of
everything myself.

16:08.458 --> 16:09.458
Well?

16:09.458 --> 16:11.208
The heffalumps and woozles

16:11.208 --> 16:14.166
certainly can't get to
my honey now, gopher,

16:14.166 --> 16:17.166
but neither can I.

16:17.166 --> 16:20.375
Not without
doors or windows.

16:20.375 --> 16:23.750
Doors? Windows?

16:23.750 --> 16:27.125
Hah! Whatever you want
from now on, sonny,

16:27.125 --> 16:30.166
you're on your--
Whoa-oh! Own!

16:32.000 --> 16:35.958
Just wait until those
little honey hoarders

16:35.958 --> 16:38.750
get a load of Wooster.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
Well,
what do you think?

16:53.000 --> 16:56.000
it's very nice,
Rabbit.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.458
Yeah.

16:58.458 --> 17:00.500
Uh, what is it?

17:00.500 --> 17:05.333
It's a sign to distract
the heffalumps and woozles.

17:05.333 --> 17:09.333
It says, "Honey this way."

17:09.333 --> 17:12.625
Uh, but Rabbit,
the sign is wrong.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.375
The honey's over there,

17:14.375 --> 17:15.875
at my house.

17:15.875 --> 17:19.708
The heffalumps
and the woozles
don't know that.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.875
This sign will
get them lost.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.000
And they'll
never come back.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.875
Excuse me, but--

17:27.875 --> 17:29.625
What are you doing here?

17:29.625 --> 17:31.583
You're supposed to be
looking out for

17:31.583 --> 17:33.625
the heffalumps
and woozles.

17:33.625 --> 17:37.166
It's time for you to do
the looking out.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.416
Your guests have arrived.

17:39.416 --> 17:42.500
They're here.
They're here!

17:42.500 --> 17:44.000
Don't worry,
long ears.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.958
They won't get by us.

17:45.958 --> 17:47.125
Come on, Roo.

17:47.125 --> 17:50.000
Yeah.
They won't get by us.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.125
Excuse me, too,
Rabbit.

17:52.125 --> 17:54.583
I have to see about
brunchfast.

17:54.583 --> 17:56.875
Of course, Pooh.
You go right ahead.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.708
Brunchfast?

17:58.708 --> 18:01.083
No sign of 'em yet,
Tigger.

18:01.083 --> 18:04.083
Yeah. I bet when they heard
that I was waitin' for 'em,

18:04.083 --> 18:06.125
they turned and went home.

18:06.125 --> 18:08.291
- What's that?

18:09.875 --> 18:11.583
I think
they're coming, Tigger.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.416
Oh, no. Maybe we should
warn the others.

18:14.416 --> 18:17.458
But you said
you were gonna smoosh 'em.

18:17.458 --> 18:19.500
Well, yeah,
well-- well, uh--

18:19.500 --> 18:22.000
Well, I didn't want to
hog all the fun.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.875
Honey.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.833
Yikes!

18:29.833 --> 18:34.583
Hey, Stan, look.
It's that mouse.

18:34.583 --> 18:37.000
Squish him, Wooster.
Squish him!

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Honey.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.250
Yeah, Wooster's right.

18:42.250 --> 18:45.958
We'll take care of youse two
after we get the honey.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.625
You want honey?

18:47.625 --> 18:50.083
Well,
why didn't you say so?

18:50.083 --> 18:52.333
Follow me.
I know a short cut.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.000
But, Tigger,
you were gonna smoosh--

18:56.125 --> 18:57.500
I forgot my mouse.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.875
Honey.

19:08.875 --> 19:11.583
Uh, that way.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.875
Honey.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.458
He can't read.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.291
Pooh!
What are you doing?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.708
The heffalumps and woozles
are coming.

19:29.708 --> 19:31.333
Oh, good.

19:31.333 --> 19:34.250
I thought they were
going to be late
for brunchfast.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.875
But Pooh Bear,

19:35.875 --> 19:38.958
these are heffalumps
and woozles.

19:38.958 --> 19:41.958
They don't like brunchfast?

19:41.958 --> 19:44.625
Honey.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.458
I think we're
about to find out.

19:47.375 --> 19:49.458
All right,
fluff bags.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.875
We said we'd be back
to steal your honey,

19:51.875 --> 19:54.625
and here we are,
so trot it all out.

19:54.625 --> 19:59.375
And our friend
may leave you
in one piece.

19:59.375 --> 20:00.875
Honey.

20:08.083 --> 20:12.375
Excuse me, mister
aren't-you-an-
awfully-big-woozle,

20:12.375 --> 20:15.583
but why do you want to
steal our honey?

20:15.583 --> 20:18.208
Eat honey.

20:18.208 --> 20:21.625
But there's
a much better way
than stealing.

20:22.708 --> 20:24.375
Don't listen to him,
Wooster.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.625
Woozles have always
stolen it.

20:26.625 --> 20:29.125
Yeah.
Don't listen to him.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.500
But friends ask.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.083
Friends share.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.875
Being friends
is even better than honey.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.708
I know.

20:38.708 --> 20:43.416
You be Wooster's friend?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.250
I told ya not to
listen to him.

20:45.250 --> 20:46.458
We don't need friends.

20:46.458 --> 20:47.875
Let's just take it.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.708
Come on, Heff,
let's show 'em one-two.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.458
Yahh!

20:54.458 --> 20:58.750
No! We ask.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.708
May we?

21:00.708 --> 21:02.875
Say please.

21:04.333 --> 21:10.500
May we please
have some honey?

21:10.500 --> 21:12.875
Why, certainly.

21:12.875 --> 21:16.750
To think a fellow woozle
would stoop to say--

21:16.750 --> 21:19.583
Pleee-ase!

21:21.291 --> 21:22.458
Fine.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.458
You may have
a giant mouse.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.625
You may have
a giant woozle.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.333
But we'll be back.

21:29.333 --> 21:32.458
Somehow,
we'll get that honey.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.291
Oh.

21:35.291 --> 21:37.458
How are we gonna
do that, Stan?

21:37.458 --> 21:40.458
Will you keep quiet,
numb nose?

21:40.458 --> 21:43.208
Uh, you know, Pooh,
I was thinking.

21:43.208 --> 21:45.708
That's a very good habit,
Piglet.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.875
No,
I was thinking about

21:48.875 --> 21:51.958
the other heffalumps
and woozles.

21:51.958 --> 21:54.500
Um, they said
they'd be back.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.125
Mmm.

21:57.125 --> 21:59.333
Honey.

21:59.333 --> 22:00.750
Don't worry, Piglet.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.458
We'll have Wooster here
to help us.

22:05.000 --> 22:07.125
Thank you, Wooster.

22:09.375 --> 22:11.708
What friends for?
