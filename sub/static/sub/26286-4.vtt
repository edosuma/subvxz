00:01.335 --> 00:03.504
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.173
KEVIN:
How in the hell can I know

00:05.206 --> 00:07.208
so little about
my dad's time in Vietnam?

00:07.241 --> 00:09.843
JACK: I got back from Vietnam
not too long ago.

00:09.877 --> 00:14.048
I had a brother.
He died in the war.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.517
Don't worry, Nicky.
I'm not going anywhere.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.421
I'm not going anywhere.

00:20.454 --> 00:22.423
*

00:30.764 --> 00:32.933
* Darkness, darkness

00:32.966 --> 00:36.170
* Be my pillow

00:36.204 --> 00:37.838
* Take my hand

00:37.871 --> 00:41.275
* And let me sleep

00:41.309 --> 00:42.910
* In the coolness...

00:42.943 --> 00:44.912
Hope you find him, Sarge.

00:44.945 --> 00:49.417
I mean, I hope the top-secret
government stuff goes well.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.285
* Of your dreams

00:51.319 --> 00:53.287
Thanks for the lift.

00:53.321 --> 00:57.125
* Darkness, darkness,
hide my yearning *

00:57.158 --> 01:02.563
* For the things
that cannot be *

01:02.596 --> 01:07.735
* Keep my mind
from constant turning *

01:07.768 --> 01:09.903
* Towards the things
I cannot see... *

01:09.937 --> 01:11.539
Where you coming from, Sarge?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.707
A fishing ville.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.110
Pulling security detail
along the Sông Trà Khúc.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.479
-JACK: The Sông Trà Khúc.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.081
It's 20... 25 klicks
southwest of here.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.717
Easy detail.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.554
-Lucky.
-Yeah.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.922
* Darkness, darkness

01:28.956 --> 01:31.759
* Long and lonesome

01:31.792 --> 01:33.394
* Is the day...

01:33.427 --> 01:34.628
That way.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.964
Follow the smell.

01:36.997 --> 01:41.602
* I have found
the edge of sadness *

01:41.635 --> 01:46.574
* I have known
the depths of fear *

01:46.607 --> 01:49.076
* Darkness, darkness

01:49.109 --> 01:51.512
* Be my blanket

01:51.545 --> 01:56.950
* Cover me
with the endless night *

01:56.984 --> 01:59.086
* Take away,
take away the pain... *

01:59.119 --> 02:01.855
Hey, little brother.

02:01.889 --> 02:07.595
* Fill the emptiness
of right now *

02:07.628 --> 02:12.032
* Emptiness of right now

02:12.065 --> 02:15.135
* Emptiness
of right now... *

02:47.000 --> 02:49.337
Squirrel, take point.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.905
Robinson, you're with me.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.974
ROBINSON:
Hmm.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.246
Still giving me orders, and I've
been here twice as long, huh?

02:58.279 --> 03:01.048
Can't help it if they
made me staff sergeant so quick.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.550
Yeah, well, you know
what tonight is?

03:02.583 --> 03:06.186
-90 days.
-90 more days. Midnight tonight.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.522
90 days, I'm out of here.
I'm gone.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.057
I'm back on the block.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.692
You know what the first thing
I'm gonna do is?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.727
-You're gonna go to Amarillo.
-Going right to Amarillo,

03:13.761 --> 03:16.364
-get me that tryout.
-You know,

03:16.397 --> 03:18.432
the Giants-- they already
got a center fielder.

03:18.466 --> 03:20.534
Willie Mays is an old man.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.703
He's keeping center field
warm for me, brother.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.672
Yeah, he's all right.

03:24.705 --> 03:28.509
I mean, look, he's no Clemente,
but he's all right.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.078
Well, if it doesn't work out
for me and the Giants,

03:31.111 --> 03:33.113
I'm going straight
to Pittsburgh,

03:33.146 --> 03:36.917
I'm-a take Clemente's job,
his woman, all of it.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.952
And because I like you, Pearson,

03:38.986 --> 03:40.388
I'm gonna leave you
a ticket to a game.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.456
Yeah. You keep
telling yourself that.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.248
What you got, Squirrel?

04:08.282 --> 04:10.418
:
Toe popper. Homemade.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.486
-Okay. Blow it.
-Okay.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.476
*

05:13.714 --> 05:16.216
Hey, Townie. Knock it off.

05:16.249 --> 05:17.718
Uh, just one more, Sarge.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.952
-No.
-Go long, pretty boy.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.320
Boone, you got a can?

05:20.354 --> 05:21.955
I don't think you got
the arm, Townie.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.624
Go deep.
-Nah, for a big boy,

05:23.657 --> 05:25.726
you sure throw like a small...

05:25.759 --> 05:28.328
-Whoa!
-Geez!

05:28.362 --> 05:30.498
Squirrel?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.900
Medic!

05:32.933 --> 05:35.769
Contact!
Contact, left!

05:36.937 --> 05:38.439
Get on! Go, go, go!

05:51.885 --> 05:54.187
-Reloading, reloading.

05:55.288 --> 05:57.458
JACK:
Boone, you good?

06:02.229 --> 06:04.331
Robinson?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.600
Hey, Robinson,
a lot of bad guys. Hose it down.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.368
I got you. Shake 'n Bake.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.338
JACK:
Go, go, go! Get on! Go, go, go!

06:11.371 --> 06:13.874
Murphy, you're with him,
I'll cover. Go, go, go!

06:28.556 --> 06:31.525
MURPHY:
Man down! Man down!

06:31.559 --> 06:32.726
I got a man down!

06:32.760 --> 06:34.762
Man down!

06:37.465 --> 06:39.467
Man down!

06:42.102 --> 06:43.571
Man down!

06:46.940 --> 06:49.643
Oh!

06:49.677 --> 06:51.779
Go, cover. Go, go, Cover.

06:51.812 --> 06:55.783
-Medic! Medic!

06:55.816 --> 06:58.886
Did you see my foot?
Did you find my foot?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.754
-I got to find my foot...
-Hey, Donnie, stay down.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.557
Stay down! Stay down, Donnie.
Stay down. Medic!

07:03.591 --> 07:06.259
Stay calm. I need
to get a tourniquet on you.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.796
Jack, I think
they can sew it back on.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.665
Jack, Jack.
Think they can sew it on?

07:11.699 --> 07:13.066
-Deac!
-Hey, Sarge.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.401
JACK:
Get some morphine in him.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.569
Get a second tourniquet on.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.670
He's bleeding out.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.271
-Murphy!

07:18.305 --> 07:19.940
-Clear.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.275
-They're retreating.

07:22.309 --> 07:24.177
-Morphine's in.
-Just ride the high.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.279
Just ride the high,
Donnie. Come on.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.782
I'm riding.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.083
I'm riding the high, Jack.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.486
-I'm cool.
-Murillo!

07:32.520 --> 07:34.788
Jack. Jack.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.657
Give me...

07:36.690 --> 07:39.760
-give me my foot, please, Jack.

07:39.793 --> 07:43.631
My foot. Just give me...

07:43.664 --> 07:45.666
MURILLO:
Sarge.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.018
Murillo, call in...

08:05.052 --> 08:06.520
call in a medevac.

08:06.554 --> 08:09.723
-One W.I.A., one K.I.A. Go.
-Roger, roger.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.892
Home Plate 3-0,
this is Indigo two-one-niner.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.962
We need a Dustoff.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.664
One W.I.A....

08:16.697 --> 08:18.699
:
What is that?

08:18.732 --> 08:20.367
JACK:
I got you a medic.
I got you, bro.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.970
I got you.
I got you.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.005
It's gonna be okay.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.744
You're gonna be okay.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.680
Come on, man.
You're gonna be okay.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.195
*

09:13.887 --> 09:16.790
I guess Clemente's job
is safe for now.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.459
Yeah, but you can
still beat Willie Mays.

09:19.492 --> 09:20.794
My ass.

09:20.828 --> 09:23.396
Hey, you're going home, man.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.599
No 90 days, Robinson.

09:25.633 --> 09:26.967
You're going home ASAP.
That's what matters.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.071
But you got more
than 90 days left.

09:31.104 --> 09:33.240
And now you got to do it
without me here.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.243
Roger that, Donnie.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.011
I'm gonna be fine.
No sweat.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.949
You're scared, Pearson.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.718
Don't you ever get
tired of pretending

09:44.752 --> 09:46.754
like you ain't
plain, flat

09:48.622 --> 09:51.792
Nah, I've been pretending
my whole life, man.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.193
I don't know any other way.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.299
My ma...

09:59.332 --> 10:00.968
she used to, um,

10:01.001 --> 10:03.236
she used to do this thing,

10:03.270 --> 10:05.172
we were little,
when we were scared.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.174
We have a monster in the closet,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.176
or we knew my pop was gone,

10:09.209 --> 10:11.979
and he was gonna come home
drunk and heated.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.847
She'd tell us to breathe.

10:13.881 --> 10:16.950
It's a funny thing
that we forget sometimes.

10:16.984 --> 10:20.420
We so scared that we gonna die,

10:20.453 --> 10:24.324
we forget to do the thing
that keeps us alive.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.493
Breathe.

10:46.213 --> 10:49.249
Jack.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.030
*

11:13.941 --> 11:16.276
One, two, three!

11:36.764 --> 11:38.766
*

11:57.317 --> 11:59.352
Heard you got
your asses 'bushed.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.521
Command's throwing you
some easy duty.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.390
You'll be pulling security
at a little river village

12:03.423 --> 12:04.792
on the Sông Trà Khúc

12:04.825 --> 12:07.560
as part of the
Strategic Hamlet Program.

12:07.594 --> 12:10.864
It'll be like Club Med
compared to the boonies.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.265
Hear they got little boats

12:12.299 --> 12:14.935
you can go fishing on
and everything.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.970
Get your men squared away,
you're leaving first thing

12:17.004 --> 12:18.505
-in the a.m.
-Yes, sir.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.944
Sir, where did you say

12:23.977 --> 12:25.946
the

12:25.979 --> 12:28.982
It's about 20 or 25 klicks
southwest of Chu Lai.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.784
Here, I'll show you.

12:35.455 --> 12:38.325
* Good-bye, mama

12:38.358 --> 12:41.661
* Good-bye to you, too

12:41.694 --> 12:45.298
* Little sister,
you'll have to wait a while *

12:45.332 --> 12:47.434
-* To come along...
-How often does the chopper

12:47.467 --> 12:49.169
come back to resupply?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.904
Every three, four days. Why?

12:50.938 --> 12:55.408
I may need you to give me a lift
one of those times.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.845
Top secret government stuff.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.685
* Got to make

13:05.718 --> 13:08.455
* One last trip to my bedroom

13:10.023 --> 13:11.458
* I guess I'll have to

13:11.491 --> 13:14.294
* Leave some stuff behind

13:16.729 --> 13:20.000
* It's funny how the same old
crooked pictures... *

13:22.169 --> 13:24.337
* Just don't seem the same

13:24.371 --> 13:26.173
* To me tonight

13:32.212 --> 13:33.813
* There ain't no use

13:33.847 --> 13:36.349
* In shedding
lonely tears, mama... *

13:38.751 --> 13:42.722
SHEEHAN:
The ville is mainly populated
by women and children,

13:42.755 --> 13:45.725
'cause all the able-bodied men
are out fighting the Vietcong,

13:45.758 --> 13:47.995
or fighting us.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.163
Battalion intel
claims this ville

13:50.197 --> 13:53.166
is riddled with VC
and VC sympathizers.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.302
They want the place pacified,

13:55.335 --> 13:56.703
whatever the hell
"pacified" means.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.038
I mean, how do you
pacify people

13:58.071 --> 14:00.307
who don't want to be pacified?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.909
But I guess we'll string some

14:01.942 --> 14:04.577
concertina wire,
try to keep out the VC riffraff

14:04.611 --> 14:06.813
and then provide a little
old-fashioned American

14:06.846 --> 14:08.648
firepower when it hits the fan,

14:08.681 --> 14:10.050
which most definitely
will happen.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.520
At night, you watch.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.923
Shadows come, shadows go.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.824
Are they against us?
Are they with us?

14:17.857 --> 14:19.826
Don't know, don't care.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.095
They cut the wire,
next day you repair the wire.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.863
Rinse and repeat.

14:23.897 --> 14:27.600
I'll be checking in on you
every couple days.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.537
This is a cush detail

14:30.570 --> 14:33.106
and it will not last forever,

14:33.140 --> 14:34.674
so do not take it for granted

14:34.707 --> 14:37.544
and do not screw it up.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.948
* I know how hard it is

14:40.981 --> 14:42.983
* Not to be younger

14:45.285 --> 14:48.288
* I know you've tried to keep me
from the cold *

14:53.893 --> 14:57.730
* And thanks for all you've
done, it may sound hollow *

15:00.267 --> 15:02.269
* Thank you for the good times

15:02.302 --> 15:05.973
* That we've known

15:06.006 --> 15:09.977
* But I must find my own road
now to follow *

15:12.679 --> 15:15.748
* You will all be welcome
in my home *

15:22.289 --> 15:25.425
* I've got my suitcase,
I must go now *

15:28.461 --> 15:30.630
* I don't mind about
the things you said. *

15:30.663 --> 15:32.966
Sarge.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.469
Wake up, gentlemen.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.305
Let's go.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.639
Come on, wake up.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.941
Think you're sleeping in
on vacation here?

15:41.975 --> 15:43.676
Murillo.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.313
Show 'em. Open the case.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.915
Look what Sarge got for us.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.617
Holy crap, Sarge.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.852
How'd you score this?

15:52.885 --> 15:55.155
Still want to play me in
high Whoa, whoa!

15:55.188 --> 15:56.789
Whoa. Back up.

15:56.823 --> 15:59.792
Now, this camp, I swear to God.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.694
I need you to police it up,

16:01.728 --> 16:04.031
and I need it done ASAP.
Right now.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.499
Pull yourselves together.
And then...

16:06.533 --> 16:08.001
we celebrate.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.005
You got two hours.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.673
Murillo, anyone makes
a move on the crate,

16:13.706 --> 16:15.308
you give 'em
a serious ass kicking,

16:15.342 --> 16:16.843
-that's an order.
-Roger that, Sarge.

16:16.876 --> 16:19.312
Townie, Murphy,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.881
get dressed,
you're with me on the wire.

16:27.254 --> 16:30.057
Man, this ville
leaks like a sieve.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.991
That's affirmative, Murph.

16:32.025 --> 16:34.294
These yo-yos,
they come and go at will,

16:34.327 --> 16:35.895
like they own the place.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.131
Well, hey, man,
they sort of do own the place.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.300
I mean, it's their ville, right?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.302
No excuses.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.237
Just saying, man.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.524
Been having nightmares
about this ville

17:04.557 --> 17:06.893
since the last time I was here.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.829
Your men are the sloppiest bunch
of junkyard dogs I've ever seen.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.765
Oh, no, no, sir.
They're in good form.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.734
Hmm.

17:17.437 --> 17:20.440
Sir, I was wondering
if I could ask you a favor.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.110
I just heard that my brother
is at LZ Gloria,

17:23.143 --> 17:25.112
and he's in a bit of trouble.

17:25.145 --> 17:28.348
Guess he's been Article 15'd,
and, well, I was wondering,

17:28.381 --> 17:30.783
since it's under
20 klicks from here,

17:30.817 --> 17:33.086
if I can get on the
next supply chopper,

17:33.120 --> 17:34.587
hitch a ride, go to him.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.523
Well, it's all
sun and fun out here,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.225
but you realize
there's a war going on?

17:38.258 --> 17:39.659
JACK:
No, I-I know,
I know that, but I...

17:40.927 --> 17:42.595
Did you catch this yourself?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.731
Oh, is this for me?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.266
Lanh! Lanh!

17:47.800 --> 17:49.001
Lanh!

17:52.071 --> 17:54.107
Hey, you little
pissant Ho Chi Minh,

17:54.141 --> 17:55.908
we don't want your fish.
Di di pronto.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.310
-Di di pronto. Scram.
-JACK: Hey, Townie,

17:57.344 --> 17:59.479
take it easy, okay?
He's just a kid.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.914
Yeah, now he is,
but wait till he turns 15.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.251
Little commie runt will
slip through that stupid wire

18:04.284 --> 18:06.052
we patch up every night
and start blowing us away.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.254
Townie.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.464
He's not wrong.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.733
Due respect, sir...

18:20.767 --> 18:23.770
I'm asking you for 24 hours
to go see my brother.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.105
Sergeant, you're down
two men already.

18:26.139 --> 18:28.007
I can't spare you.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.777
And your squad doesn't exactly
inspire me with confidence.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.431
* Lonely feeling

18:51.464 --> 18:53.666
* Deep inside

18:53.700 --> 18:56.203
* Find a corner

18:56.236 --> 18:58.104
* Where I can hide

18:58.137 --> 19:00.640
* Silent footsteps

19:00.673 --> 19:02.275
* Crowding me

19:02.309 --> 19:06.012
* Sudden darkness

19:06.045 --> 19:09.216
* But I can see

19:09.249 --> 19:11.851
* No sugar tonight
in my coffee *

19:11.884 --> 19:14.354
* No sugar tonight in my tea,
no sugar to stand... *

19:23.730 --> 19:25.131
Hey there, Joe.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.768
Hello, Mrs. Pearson.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.505
Oh, I'm such a klutz.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.908
Have a good day, Joe.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.755
-Hey, Ma.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.825
Just checking on you.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.244
NICKY:
Dear family,

20:45.278 --> 20:47.947
I'm up at a forward firebase
called LZ Gloria

20:47.980 --> 20:50.116
somewhere out in the boonies
of Quang Nam Province.

20:50.149 --> 20:53.219
I got Article 15'd.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.954
That's getting my rank
busted to PFC

20:54.987 --> 20:56.489
for "reckless endangerment
to myself

20:56.523 --> 20:58.391
and to my fellow soldiers,"

20:58.425 --> 21:00.460
like I'm the danger,
and not this messed up war.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.837
I'm not getting out of here
alive, I know that,

21:10.870 --> 21:12.672
but I'm not dying on anyone's
terms but my own.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.741
* If you were a bird
and you lived very high *

21:14.774 --> 21:16.309
* Knew even the wind...

21:16.343 --> 21:18.277
I'm living
in hell on earth, family.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.514
Hell, I may have already died
and I don't even know it.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.584
* That's where
I wanted to go today *

21:24.617 --> 21:28.421
* And I do know that I need...

21:28.455 --> 21:30.457
I hope to see you again.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.825
Wherever that may be.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.994
Love, Nick.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.897
* Around

21:46.072 --> 21:49.208
* Love

21:49.241 --> 21:51.644
* Like a mountain springtime

21:51.678 --> 21:53.012
* Flashing through

21:53.045 --> 21:56.015
* The rivers of my mind

21:56.048 --> 21:57.517
* It's what I feel

21:57.550 --> 22:01.521
* For you...

22:08.160 --> 22:10.162
RECEPTIONIST:
Jack Pearson?

22:14.767 --> 22:17.136
Your pulse is high.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.372
Doctors make me nervous.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.841
I've been your family doctor
since you were six, Jack.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.477
If I'm still making you nervous,
I'm not doing my job very well.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.748
Hey, you know, Nicky
wanted to be a doctor?

22:28.781 --> 22:31.050
Well, wants.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.552
Wants to be a doctor.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.754
-Didn't know that.
-Yeah.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.424
Maybe because he was always
sick as a kid.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.091
I don't know.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.028
But he did love the science
of it all, I think.

22:42.061 --> 22:45.097
And even when we were little,

22:45.131 --> 22:49.035
i-if I got a cold...

22:49.068 --> 22:53.005
he'd-he'd try to figure out the
perfect combo of O.J. or soup

22:53.039 --> 22:55.107
to make me feel better,
you know?

23:06.586 --> 23:10.457
I want to enlist, Doc.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.592
I need to be there with him.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.228
You have a legitimate reason
not to go, Jack.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.697
The tachycardia...

23:17.730 --> 23:19.632
It's a harmless
irregular heartbeat.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.735
Look, I was fine to take
the 4-F, avoid the war.

23:22.769 --> 23:25.738
I'm not stupid, but...

23:25.772 --> 23:28.207
well, he's there now,

23:28.240 --> 23:29.742
and he's struggling.

23:31.678 --> 23:35.114
Look, I just need
to be where he is.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.619
Okay? Even if
I can't get to him.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.321
Even if I can't
do anything for him.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.957
I just need to be there.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.328
He's my little brother, Doc.

23:49.361 --> 23:51.631
It's my job to take care of him.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.300
That is my only job.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.907
Do a hundred push-ups
right before you go in.

24:00.940 --> 24:04.343
Then catch your breath.
That should help you pass.

24:04.376 --> 24:06.345
Should help balance it out.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.481
If they notice anything,

24:08.515 --> 24:10.850
just say you're nervous.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.852
Honestly, they'll probably
be so surprised

24:12.885 --> 24:16.288
to see anybody volunteer
for this damn war now,

24:16.322 --> 24:19.659
it's your brain
they'll want to check.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.011
*

24:49.155 --> 24:51.357
Want a little coffee
with your sugar?

24:51.390 --> 24:53.459
Funny.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.494
(song playing faintly
over radio)

24:58.264 --> 25:01.868
So you just gonna stand around,
watch me work all day?

25:01.901 --> 25:04.503
Hey, man, I'm just...

25:04.537 --> 25:05.938
trying to pass the time.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.377
Get any sleep?

25:11.410 --> 25:13.412
Not really. You?

25:13.445 --> 25:15.848
Slept like a baby, 'cause
everything's gonna be all right.

25:15.882 --> 25:18.484
Yeah, not if my number comes up.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.086
The lottery, I mean.

25:20.119 --> 25:23.055
It's not gonna happen, Nicky.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.024
-It might.
-It won't.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.059
Yeah, I know.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.561
You got a plan.

25:28.595 --> 25:29.762
I don't.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.798
Yeah, you do.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.902
My own personal Superman.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.504
Just your big brother.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.872
And I'm your Lois Lane.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.374
Always needing to be saved.

25:42.408 --> 25:45.912
You know that is not
who you are, right?

25:47.146 --> 25:49.716
Okay.

25:53.152 --> 25:54.286
Hey, look, we'll...

25:54.320 --> 25:56.088
we'll watch at the bar tonight.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.259
I have a plan.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.331
Thanks, Supe.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.875
ANCHOR:
...the president may be
under great pressure

26:15.908 --> 26:18.044

a heavier second step
American troop withdrawal...

26:20.780 --> 26:22.314
From the White House...

26:22.348 --> 26:24.884
Hey, Nicky. Let's go.
It's almost time.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.219
No, we're gonna
watch it downtown.

26:27.253 --> 26:28.655
You're not watching it here?

26:28.688 --> 26:30.222
It's draft lottery,

26:30.256 --> 26:31.624
it's not the Super Bowl.

26:32.859 --> 26:34.326
Remember, sweetie,

26:34.360 --> 26:37.563
you were born lucky,
and I'm praying for you.

26:37.596 --> 26:38.965
Thanks, Mom.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.099
Yeah, thanks, Mommy.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.235
Look out for your brother.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.271
-Always do.
-Yeah,

to look out for himself.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.429

27:10.462 --> 27:13.265
* Do you wonder

27:13.299 --> 27:17.804
* As the day grows...

27:20.840 --> 27:22.274
Slow down.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.176
Nick, slow down.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.013
Oh, they're gonna
call my number.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.682
I just know
they're gonna call my number.

27:31.017 --> 27:34.653
Hey, you were born lucky.
Remember?

27:34.687 --> 27:37.790

gonna get drafted.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.366
Yeah.

29:49.488 --> 29:50.957
MAN 2:
December 6

29:50.990 --> 29:52.992
is zero, one, zero.

30:23.890 --> 30:25.892
Make me proud, son.

30:55.287 --> 30:58.057
You guys enjoy
your hunting trip.

30:58.090 --> 31:01.493
Thanks, Ma.

31:01.527 --> 31:04.763
I love you, Nicky.
I love you so much.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.798
I love you, too.

31:44.603 --> 31:46.572
* The people on this train

31:46.605 --> 31:48.941
* Are from a different age

31:48.975 --> 31:51.710
* The woman's taking a man back
'cause he's... *

31:51.743 --> 31:53.712
He's never gonna
speak to me again.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.881
* And everyone but me is going
somewhere to... *

31:55.914 --> 31:57.549
Lucky.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.818
* I'm on a train ride

31:59.851 --> 32:02.321
* It's just for fun,
I'm on a train ride... *

32:02.354 --> 32:06.158
Hey, you know it's not your job
to fight his demons, Nick.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.427
* These people seek something
of which I want none *

32:10.262 --> 32:14.000
* That is to say that
they have contempt for fun *

32:14.033 --> 32:17.936
* Their minds are so closed
that they can't understand... *

32:17.970 --> 32:19.905
I wonder
what happens next to me.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.141
* Just for fun

32:22.174 --> 32:24.343
* I'm on a train ride...

32:24.376 --> 32:26.412
It's weird, isn't it--

32:26.445 --> 32:28.647
the way we
think about our lives?

32:30.649 --> 32:32.518
What's next?

32:32.551 --> 32:34.153
What happens next?

32:34.186 --> 32:36.455
Always moving forward.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.825
* Let them drink bitters,
I will drink wine... *

32:39.858 --> 32:41.760
I wonder if things
would make more sense

32:41.793 --> 32:44.196
if you looked at everything
in reverse.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.132
Like, if you...

32:46.165 --> 32:48.267
started at the end,

32:48.300 --> 32:51.703
and move backwards and try
to figure out how you got there.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.943
I wish I could do that
right now.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.445
* Just for fun

32:59.478 --> 33:01.013
* And I ain't gonna stop

33:03.515 --> 33:07.386
* But for these scarecrows
I know not but where... *

33:07.419 --> 33:09.888
I read that you could
become a medic

33:09.921 --> 33:11.690
if you train in Texas
for two months.

33:13.892 --> 33:16.828
Medics get shot, too, Nicky.

33:27.073 --> 33:28.974
We're almost 30 miles
from the border.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.643
Let's... let's get a motel.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.713
Get some rest.
You... you can cross tomorrow.

33:34.746 --> 33:38.084
* Just for fun,
I'm on a train ride *

33:38.117 --> 33:41.820
* Just for fun,
yeah, this train ride *

33:41.853 --> 33:45.023
* Just for fun.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.259
*

34:40.078 --> 34:42.047
Nicky, go long.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.649
I won't catch it.

34:43.682 --> 34:46.318
You can do it, come on.
Go long.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.092
Ow.

34:58.164 --> 34:59.598
It's okay, Nicky, you're okay.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.333
-My glasses.
-It's okay, it's okay,

35:01.367 --> 35:03.602
it's okay.
You're-you're fine.

35:06.205 --> 35:09.675
If he sees the glasses
he'll be mad.

35:09.708 --> 35:12.478
He'll be mad at me, not you.

35:12.511 --> 35:16.348
I'll never let him touch you.

35:16.382 --> 35:18.184
I hate my glasses, anyway.

35:18.217 --> 35:21.753
Come on.
They make you look smart.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.689
No one tough wears glasses.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.757
What about Superman?

35:25.791 --> 35:28.093
Superman doesn't wear glasses.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.861
He does when he's Clark Kent.

35:29.895 --> 35:31.096
Not when he's Superman.

35:31.129 --> 35:34.433
He's a tough guy in disguise.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.834
That's you, Nicky.

35:35.867 --> 35:39.605
You're Clark Kent.
You're CK.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.940
Tough guy in disguise.

35:41.973 --> 35:44.142
Just a matter of time
before people realize

35:44.176 --> 35:46.512
you're actually Superman.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.066
Christ's sake,
clean up your toys.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.879
STANLEY :
Don't you tell me what I need!

36:20.912 --> 36:24.082
MARILYN:
Stanley, it's late.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.918
STANLEY:
Please, hey... don't touch...
don't touch that.

36:26.952 --> 36:29.020
-Don't!

36:29.054 --> 36:32.858
-Hey!

36:32.891 --> 36:36.262
I don't want to hear it.
Bring that back!

36:36.295 --> 36:38.730
Leave me alone, leave that here.

36:38.764 --> 36:40.198
All right?
I don't want to hear it.

36:40.232 --> 36:41.667
All right, get back to your...

36:41.700 --> 36:43.735
*

36:43.769 --> 36:47.239
...touch that.

36:47.273 --> 36:49.040
Don't you dare tell me
what I need.

36:49.074 --> 36:50.676
Leave her alone.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.214
Isn't this cute?

36:59.418 --> 37:00.652
Okay, Stanley, come on.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.929
Three of you deserve each other.

37:19.170 --> 37:20.739
I'm sorry, boys.

37:20.772 --> 37:22.441
I'm so sorry.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.076
He didn't use to be this way.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.546
Jack.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.148
Sweetie, your heart is racing.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.983
It always beats fast.

37:32.017 --> 37:34.019
I'm fine.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.596
-MARILYN:
Oh, Stanley, I'm scared.
-No, no, just keep breathing.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.898
You're doing great.
Mom's gonna be just fine, Jack.

37:46.932 --> 37:49.134
Okay, sir,
we'll take it from here.

37:49.167 --> 37:50.636
-Stanley.
-No, no, come on, hon,

37:50.669 --> 37:52.103
you've done this before.

37:52.137 --> 37:53.639
Okay? You did great
the first time,

37:53.672 --> 37:55.140
-you're gonna do great now.
-Okay. Right.

37:57.676 --> 38:00.579
MARILYN:
Jack.

38:07.886 --> 38:11.757
You're a lucky woman,
having a baby on October 18.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.026
18 is my lucky number, you know?

38:15.060 --> 38:17.596
My best daughter
was born on the 18th,

38:17.629 --> 38:19.865
I was 18 when I got married

38:19.898 --> 38:23.101
and June 18 is my anniversary.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.438
Yes, ma'am,
super lucky day today.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.840
Lucky baby.

38:28.874 --> 38:32.444
My husband's hoping I can
hold out till tomorrow.

38:32.478 --> 38:35.213
The 19th
is his father's birthday.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.682
You like his father?

38:43.589 --> 38:46.358
Dad, do you want
a boy or a girl?

38:46.392 --> 38:49.995
-Truth.

38:50.028 --> 38:52.030
:
I want another boy.

38:54.766 --> 38:57.503
Ah, there you are.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.137
Hey, Dad.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.873
Eh, any news?

39:01.907 --> 39:04.309
No, not yet.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.178
Oh.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.316
You pick a name?

39:11.349 --> 39:14.185
Yeah. Nick if it's a boy,

39:14.219 --> 39:16.321
and Noreen if it's a girl.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.023
What do you think?

39:18.056 --> 39:19.858
Yeah.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.593
Yeah, sure.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.730
Yeah.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.720
It's been hours.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.923
Yeah.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.196
You want a swig?

39:58.229 --> 40:01.132
Come on, Dad,
you know I don't drink.

40:09.441 --> 40:11.810
Hey, Dad, you know, if that
kid's born after midnight,

40:11.843 --> 40:13.479
you'll share a birthday.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.986
Yeah, well, it is getting late.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.321
Your mother's
held dinner for me.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.992
I expect you'll send word.

40:29.461 --> 40:32.130
-Thanks for coming down, Dad.
-Yeah.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.737
* Darkness, darkness

40:38.770 --> 40:41.406
* Be my pillow

40:41.439 --> 40:42.808
* Take my head...

40:42.841 --> 40:44.743
Here you go.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.745
Here's your mama.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.981
* In the coolness

40:50.015 --> 40:52.951
* Of your shadow...

40:52.984 --> 40:56.154
Well, 11:58 p.m.--

40:56.187 --> 40:58.323
made it just by the skin
of our teeth.

40:58.356 --> 40:59.791
* Darkness, darkness...

40:59.825 --> 41:02.528
That guy, right there.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.362
That's your little brother.

41:04.395 --> 41:07.198
NURSE:
October 18 after all.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.168
18 is a very lucky number.

41:10.201 --> 41:12.804
Very lucky number indeed.

41:12.838 --> 41:14.472
Now, remember...

41:14.506 --> 41:17.776
big brothers look out
for their little brothers.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.278
It's their only job.

41:20.311 --> 41:22.981
It's the only thing
that matters.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.852
And you know what?

41:26.885 --> 41:28.987
All these little guys in there--

41:29.020 --> 41:31.823
every single one of 'em--

41:31.857 --> 41:35.661
they have the same birthday
as your little brother.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.163
* Be my pillow

41:38.196 --> 41:40.398
* Take my head

41:40.431 --> 41:42.433
* And let me sleep

41:43.501 --> 41:45.871
* In the coolness

41:45.904 --> 41:48.907
* Of my shadow

41:48.940 --> 41:51.710
* In the silence

41:51.743 --> 41:54.813
* Of my dream

41:54.846 --> 41:57.148
* Darkness, darkness

41:57.182 --> 41:59.585
* Be my blanket

41:59.618 --> 42:02.320
* Cover me

42:02.353 --> 42:04.890
* With the endless night

42:04.923 --> 42:07.025
* Take away...

42:07.058 --> 42:09.194
Hey, little brother.

42:10.796 --> 42:13.064
* Fill the emptiness

42:13.098 --> 42:15.734
* Of right now

42:15.767 --> 42:18.870
* In the emptiness

42:18.904 --> 42:21.907
* Of right now

42:21.940 --> 42:24.409
* In the emptiness
of right now. *
