[instrumental music]

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
[beeping]

00:10.667 --> 00:11.958
[sighs]

00:12.042 --> 00:14.042
Oh, what the hell
is it with this place

00:14.125 --> 00:17.458
that I can't get just
one solid night's sleep?

00:18.875 --> 00:20.333
Ahh.

00:21.542 --> 00:24.958
Lights.

00:25.042 --> 00:26.417
Yeah, what is it?

00:26.500 --> 00:28.083
[automated response]
'Incoming message from Mars'

00:28.167 --> 00:29.583
'sent by William Edgars.'

00:29.667 --> 00:31.000
'Do you wish to receive?'

00:31.083 --> 00:32.833
Yeah, put it through.

00:32.917 --> 00:35.000
(Edgars)
'Good morning, Mr. Garibaldi.'

00:35.083 --> 00:36.917
Mr. Edgars, have I ever
mentioned to you

00:37.000 --> 00:39.125
that there is
a seven-hour time difference

00:39.208 --> 00:41.583
between Babylon 5 and Mars?

00:41.667 --> 00:42.875
'Yes, you have.'

00:42.958 --> 00:45.208
'But I am on call
24 hours a day'

00:45.292 --> 00:48.792
'and I expect the same
from everyone who works for me.'

00:48.875 --> 00:50.750
'I should think
the weekly retainer'

00:50.833 --> 00:52.125
'I'm currently paying you'

00:52.208 --> 00:55.000
'entitles me to some
small eccentricities.'

00:55.083 --> 00:57.958
Yeah, yeah.
So what's the job?

00:58.042 --> 00:59.458
'Another package
will be arriving'

00:59.542 --> 01:01.792
'on Babylon 5 later today.'

01:01.875 --> 01:03.958
'You are to ensure
that it goes through customs'

01:04.042 --> 01:07.958
'without incident and send it on
to my people on Io.'

01:08.042 --> 01:09.250
What's inside?

01:09.333 --> 01:12.333
'Nothing dangerous,
explosive, or illegal.'

01:12.417 --> 01:14.458
'That was our agreement.'

01:14.542 --> 01:15.875
So why all the secrecy?

01:15.958 --> 01:18.375
'The packages contain
advanced compounds'

01:18.458 --> 01:21.083
'for my pharmaceutical
research department.'

01:21.167 --> 01:24.167
'I don't want the raw materials
to fall into the wrong hands'

01:24.250 --> 01:26.167
'before I can patent them.'

01:26.250 --> 01:27.667
'I don't trust
the government'

01:27.750 --> 01:29.917
'and I don't
trust the couriers.'

01:30.000 --> 01:33.167
'And I definitely
don't trust my competitors.'

01:33.250 --> 01:34.500
But you trust me.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.833
'For now.'

01:37.333 --> 01:38.875
Alright.

01:38.958 --> 01:42.250
Upload the data
and I'll, uh, I'll get on it.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.667
By the way, uh

01:43.750 --> 01:45.750
you mentioned earlier
that I'd be coming to Mars

01:45.833 --> 01:48.833
for a personal meeting so we
could get to know one another.

01:48.917 --> 01:50.750
Any idea when that's
gonna happen?

01:50.833 --> 01:54.208
'In the fullness of time,
Mr. Garibaldi.'

01:54.292 --> 01:55.833
'Good-bye.'

01:56.333 --> 01:57.375
[beeps]

02:12.083 --> 02:13.708
[beeps]

02:13.792 --> 02:15.375
Sheridan to C and C.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.667
(male #1)
'This is C and C. Go.'

02:17.750 --> 02:20.042
Yeah, any luck
with my transmission to Minbari?

02:20.125 --> 02:22.125
'Uh, negative. We're still
unable to get through.'

02:22.208 --> 02:23.708
'We've heard there's
still fighting'

02:23.792 --> 02:26.875
'going on in the capital
but, uh, so far no details.'

02:28.792 --> 02:30.875
Have you received anything
new from Ambassador Delenn

02:30.958 --> 02:32.083
since she landed?

02:32.167 --> 02:33.417
'Negative, captain.'

02:36.125 --> 02:39.208
Alright, keep trying. Let me
know when you get through.

02:39.292 --> 02:41.208
'I'm sure she's okay, sir.'

02:43.167 --> 02:44.792
I hope so.

02:44.875 --> 02:45.958
[beeps]

03:03.375 --> 03:04.917
[intense music]

03:25.000 --> 03:26.458
[gasps]

03:29.708 --> 03:31.625
[woman groaning]

03:31.708 --> 03:33.208
[distant explosion]

03:36.375 --> 03:38.292
How is it outside?

03:38.375 --> 03:40.208
Much the same
as it is in here.

03:40.292 --> 03:42.625
[explosion]

03:45.542 --> 03:47.125
I should tell you
we just received word

03:47.208 --> 03:49.458
from the leader
of the warrior caste.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.292
His forces have
surrounded the city.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.958
He says if we don't
surrender by tomorrow

03:55.042 --> 03:56.792
for the good of our people,
he will end the war

03:56.875 --> 03:59.500
by destroying the city
and everyone in it.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.792
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.750
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.833
(G'kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

04:13.917 --> 04:15.833
(Lyta)
It was the year
of rebirth.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.167
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.750
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.208
(Delenn)
And the year of joy.

04:21.292 --> 04:22.958
(Londo)
It was a new age.

04:23.042 --> 04:24.833
(Franklin)
It was the end of history.

04:24.917 --> 04:28.167
(Susan)
It was the year
everything changed.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.000
(Michael)
The year is 2261.

04:33.083 --> 04:36.250
(John)
The place, "Babylon 5."

04:36.333 --> 04:38.500
[theme music]

05:08.625 --> 05:10.542
[music continues]

05:38.792 --> 05:41.083
(Lyta)
And from 2247

05:41.167 --> 05:43.750
to 2257

05:43.833 --> 05:46.083
I was the commercial
telepath for Xenocorp.

05:46.167 --> 05:48.583
I monitored their negotiations
with representatives

05:48.667 --> 05:52.208
from Centauri Prime, Narn,
and Pak'ma.

05:52.292 --> 05:54.542
So scanning alien minds
doesn't bother you?

05:54.625 --> 05:55.917
Well, it's not comfortable.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
I don't think
any of us enjoys it

05:58.083 --> 05:59.458
but you get used to it.

05:59.542 --> 06:01.750
My employer needs to know
if their client is lying

06:01.833 --> 06:04.833
and that client happens to be
an alien and agrees to the scan

06:04.917 --> 06:06.750
you just do it.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.583
I see you interned
with the Psi Corps.

06:09.667 --> 06:11.917
- One year?
- I was a field assistant.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.125
Why'd you change
to commercial work?

06:14.208 --> 06:16.458
It just wasn't right for me.

06:16.542 --> 06:17.792
And there was no room
for advancement.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.500
As a P-5, the best
I could hope for

06:19.583 --> 06:22.375
was doing background
interviews, uh

06:22.458 --> 06:24.708
authorized witness scans.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.083
I like working corporate.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.375
Good.

06:27.458 --> 06:29.250
Well, everything seems
to be in order.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.208
We've been looking
for a freelance telepath

06:31.292 --> 06:33.625
to work with our interstellar
contracts division

06:33.708 --> 06:36.583
and you seem to have
the right experience.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.500
Of course, we'll have to run
the usual background checks

06:38.583 --> 06:40.625
get authorization
from Psi Corps, but--

06:40.708 --> 06:43.083
Well, that might be a problem.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.208
I'm not with the Corps anymore.

06:45.292 --> 06:46.833
How can you operate
on Babylon 5--

06:46.917 --> 06:48.417
Well, I'm operating here under

06:48.500 --> 06:52.542
a-a kind of special dispensation
from Captain Sheridan.

06:52.625 --> 06:54.833
Oh, he could vouch for me.

06:54.917 --> 06:56.333
Well, I'm sure he can

06:56.417 --> 06:57.708
but his word
doesn't exactly

06:57.792 --> 07:00.500
carry a lot of weight
back home right now.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.000
This is very disappointing.

07:03.083 --> 07:05.625
Uh.. But..

07:05.708 --> 07:07.667
You said I had
the right background.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.958
You do, but our insurance
policy requires

07:10.042 --> 07:11.542
that all telepaths
engaged by our firm

07:11.625 --> 07:13.500
be current licensed members
of Psi Corps.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.583
That indemnifies us
against any lawsuits

07:15.667 --> 07:17.333
on the grounds
of mental distress

07:17.417 --> 07:18.833
or invasion of privacy.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.042
I am sure there is some way
we can work this out.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.667
No. If it were up to me,
Miss Alexander

07:22.750 --> 07:23.875
I'd give you the job.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.292
But I'm answerable
to our attorneys

07:25.375 --> 07:26.500
and the board of directors.

07:26.583 --> 07:27.792
They can't afford
the liability.

07:27.875 --> 07:29.583
- But--
- I'm sorry.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.167
Perhaps in the future
when you rejoin Psi Corps

07:32.250 --> 07:33.667
we can discuss this again.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.833
Until then, I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.000
Good day.

07:40.083 --> 07:41.792
[dramatic music]

07:54.750 --> 07:57.375
Neroon. Good.

07:57.458 --> 08:01.042
I'm pleased to see
you made it here alive.

08:01.125 --> 08:02.792
I understand
the religious caste

08:02.875 --> 08:05.125
is most upset with you.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.125
That is to be expected.

08:07.208 --> 08:10.708
They were hoping I would
organize our caste against you.

08:10.792 --> 08:13.500
But I could no sooner move
against the leader of my caste

08:13.583 --> 08:17.042
than I could grow wings
and fly across the moon.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.875
They were always naive.

08:18.958 --> 08:22.083
That has been their failing
from the beginning.

08:22.167 --> 08:25.917
Our people need
leadership, not dogma.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.708
Action, not meditation.

08:28.792 --> 08:32.417
They assumed they were
our equal in all things.

08:32.500 --> 08:35.375
They have now learned
otherwise.

08:35.458 --> 08:37.083
Yes.

08:37.167 --> 08:40.750
I do wonder, though,
about the cost.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.208
The cities can be rebuilt.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.917
As far as those
who've died

08:47.000 --> 08:49.583
I feel for them
as much as you do.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.667
But we all die, Neroon.

08:51.750 --> 08:54.000
Only the timing varies.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.083
They will be reborn

08:55.167 --> 08:58.500
into the next generation
of Minbari.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.667
Perhaps even as warrior caste.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.458
There was no other way.

09:04.542 --> 09:07.500
The loss of a few lives now
will save us many more lives

09:07.583 --> 09:08.792
in the future.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.333
Remember, it was
the religious caste

09:11.417 --> 09:13.875
that got us into the war
with the humans.

09:13.958 --> 09:17.167
Then, after many of our caste
died fighting it

09:17.250 --> 09:19.792
it was they
who just stopped.

09:19.875 --> 09:23.583
If we go to war, it should be
for practical gains.

09:23.667 --> 09:27.792
Not holy wars
or wars of principle.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.375
It's a hard lesson

09:29.458 --> 09:31.542
but they have to learn it.

09:33.625 --> 09:38.125
Delenn speaks
for the religious caste now.

09:38.208 --> 09:41.167
She values life
above all things.

09:42.542 --> 09:46.125
As she sees her caste
dying around her..

09:46.208 --> 09:49.042
...she will have no choice
but to surrender.

09:51.417 --> 09:54.042
Is it wrong to value life?

09:54.125 --> 09:55.750
I thought
that is why we fought.

09:55.833 --> 09:58.000
We fight because
it is our nature.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.875
It is the calling
of our heart.

10:00.958 --> 10:04.542
Life and death are simply
two possible consequences

10:04.625 --> 10:08.917
both equal, neither valued
nor feared above the other.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.500
For a warrior

10:10.583 --> 10:14.250
death is simply the release
from our obligation.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.083
'You should rest.
You've done well, Neroon.'

10:23.042 --> 10:26.375
(male #2)
'Okay, everybody, please have
your identicards out'

10:26.458 --> 10:27.625
and ready for inspection.

10:27.708 --> 10:30.167
Just go on. Move along.
He'll take care.

10:34.208 --> 10:36.500
- Yeah. Keep moving.
- 'Chief, wait!'

10:36.583 --> 10:39.125
- What? What is it?
- I thought you should see this.

10:40.167 --> 10:43.208
Well, back so soon,
Mr. Bester?

10:43.292 --> 10:44.708
Seemed like forever.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.833
Hm, and to what do we owe
the honor of this visit?

10:46.917 --> 10:51.208
Nothing. My business isn't
with you or the command staff.

10:51.292 --> 10:54.083
I'm here strictly as a
representative of the Psi Corps.

10:54.167 --> 10:55.875
Doing what?

10:55.958 --> 10:59.125
Personal matters that are
none of your concern.

10:59.208 --> 11:00.500
I'm not taking anyone with me

11:00.583 --> 11:02.875
or causing you
the slightest difficulty.

11:02.958 --> 11:05.458
As hard as it might be
for you to grasp this

11:05.542 --> 11:08.542
I do have a life that doesn't
involve Babylon 5

11:08.625 --> 11:10.083
Sheridan, Ivanova

11:10.167 --> 11:13.750
or anyone else on the command
staff. I can promise you.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.958
- I won't go near them.
- Well, I don't think--

11:17.042 --> 11:21.167
Mr. Allan, I'd remind you
that this is a free port

11:21.250 --> 11:22.583
at least that's what
Ivanova keeps saying

11:22.667 --> 11:25.750
on this so-called
voice of resistance.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.792
"Everyone's welcome here."

11:27.875 --> 11:30.958
Now, is that true
or is it a lie?

11:31.042 --> 11:33.417
If it's true, as long as
I keep to myself

11:33.500 --> 11:36.083
you've got no reason
to hold me.

11:36.167 --> 11:37.750
I have legitimate
business here.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.417
Either let me get on with it
or stop pretending

11:39.500 --> 11:42.208
that this is anything other
than a military dictatorship.

11:42.292 --> 11:44.500
Yeah, well, I can't make
that decision on my own.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.042
I'll have to check
with the captain.

11:46.125 --> 11:48.375
Please do.
I'll be waiting right here.

11:51.833 --> 11:55.750
Mr. Allan seems to be under
a great deal of stress.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.958
I don't think
he's eating right.

11:58.042 --> 12:00.208
Make sure he gets
enough fiber.

12:00.292 --> 12:01.958
That's always important.

12:02.042 --> 12:04.125
Mind your own business.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.625
"Humanity is my business."

12:06.708 --> 12:08.333
[chuckles]

12:08.417 --> 12:10.167
Marley to Scrooge.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.250
Dickens.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.667
A Christmas carol.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.750
Well, it's good to see they're
continuing the fine tradition

12:20.833 --> 12:23.542
of hiring from the shallow end
of the gene pool.

12:24.167 --> 12:25.833
[dramatic music]

12:30.208 --> 12:32.542
Garibaldi! Michael, wait.

12:39.458 --> 12:41.125
- Michael!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Zack.

12:41.208 --> 12:43.000
I can't stop to chat. I've got
a very busy day ahead of me.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.875
- Where's the package?
- What package?

12:45.958 --> 12:47.625
Some guy handed you
a package back in customs.

12:47.708 --> 12:49.292
Where is it?

12:49.375 --> 12:50.708
I don't know what you're
talking about, Zack.

12:50.792 --> 12:52.292
Oh, by the way,
I like the suit.

12:52.375 --> 12:54.042
You know, it kind of reminds me
of the one I used to have.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.958
Okay, now, that's enough.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.208
There's a rumor going around
that you're working

12:58.292 --> 12:59.833
for William Edgars helping him

12:59.917 --> 13:02.375
get stuff through here without
any questions being asked.

13:02.458 --> 13:03.833
My client list
is confidential.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.375
My policy.. I don't
confirm or deny.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.833
Michael, listen to me.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.833
I checked this Edgars out.

13:09.917 --> 13:11.500
He's one of the 10 richest guys
in the alliance

13:11.583 --> 13:14.000
but there's not one single
picture of him anywhere.

13:14.083 --> 13:15.917
So a guy like him, he's got
to worry about getting hit

13:16.000 --> 13:19.042
by terrorists, kidnappers.
So what?

13:19.125 --> 13:21.708
So what does a guy like him,
want with you?

13:21.792 --> 13:23.625
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying--

13:23.708 --> 13:25.208
No, no, I know exactly
what you're saying.

13:25.292 --> 13:26.333
You're saying
that I'm not good enough

13:26.417 --> 13:27.542
to work with the big guys.

13:27.625 --> 13:29.042
Now, look, now, I'm not saying
that I am

13:29.125 --> 13:30.500
and I'm not saying that I ain't,
but, pal, you know what?

13:30.583 --> 13:31.875
You oughta start giving me
a little bit of credit

13:31.958 --> 13:34.833
around here. You know,
I work hard, I'm honest.

13:34.917 --> 13:37.792
Maybe you don't appreciate it,
but others do.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.125
And getting packages
past customs..

13:41.625 --> 13:43.708
...is that honest, Michael?

13:43.792 --> 13:45.667
Yeah, it's about
as honest and lawful

13:45.750 --> 13:47.042
as breaking away
from earth alliance

13:47.125 --> 13:48.542
taking over
military equipment

13:48.625 --> 13:50.458
starting our own
little empire out here.

13:50.542 --> 13:51.875
You know what, Zack,
if you got a problem

13:51.958 --> 13:53.250
why don't you take
a peek in the mirror?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.208
Don't bother me, okay?

14:00.708 --> 14:02.833
[intense music]

14:12.833 --> 14:14.250
You sent for me, Delenn?

14:14.333 --> 14:15.625
Yes.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.792
I have spoken
with the others.

14:18.875 --> 14:21.000
We have reached the decision.

14:22.708 --> 14:25.042
Tell the warrior caste..

14:25.125 --> 14:27.583
...that we are prepared
to surrender

14:27.667 --> 14:29.750
at a time and place
of their choosing.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.125
- But--
- Tell them, Lennier.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.708
Just tell them.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.625
And news has reached us that
a squadron of starfury pilots

14:51.708 --> 14:54.000
sent to conduct raids
against Proxima 3

14:54.083 --> 14:55.583
'in hopes of forcing
them to accept'

14:55.667 --> 14:57.458
'President Clark's
martial law decree'

14:57.542 --> 15:00.292
'have defected, joining
the proxima resistance.'

15:00.375 --> 15:02.042
'This makes the fourth
major defection'

15:02.125 --> 15:03.625
'in the last two weeks.'

15:03.708 --> 15:05.958
'Refugees from sectors
400 through 600'

15:06.042 --> 15:07.958
'are being taken in
by the medical colonies'

15:08.042 --> 15:11.417
'at Beta Durani and the
MacArthur midrange colony.'

15:11.500 --> 15:13.708
'Ships wishing to defect
should broadcast'

15:13.792 --> 15:15.125
'their intention to the 9,000..'

15:15.208 --> 15:17.417
I said I don't want
to talk to you.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.958
I heard you.

15:19.042 --> 15:20.958
Came through loud and clear.

15:21.042 --> 15:23.500
Extremely loud
and clear, actually.

15:23.583 --> 15:27.833
Amazing. All those channels
and nothing worth watching.

15:27.917 --> 15:31.500
If you've got something to say,
say it and get out.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.292
That's a very poor way
to treat someone

15:33.375 --> 15:36.167
who's come all this way
just to do you a favor.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.542
Please.

15:37.625 --> 15:40.500
I know you've been
looking for work.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.667
A couple of the corporations
you approached called us

15:43.750 --> 15:45.667
about a reference.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.583
Naturally we couldn't
provide one since

15:47.667 --> 15:49.750
you've gone rogue, and..

15:49.833 --> 15:52.333
...the Corps frowns
on that sort of thing.

15:52.417 --> 15:54.958
I imagine you must be getting
desperate for money by now

15:55.042 --> 15:56.833
or you wouldn't be doing this.

15:56.917 --> 15:59.375
- I'm fine.
- Of course you are.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.500
It's just a little
one-sided, isn't it?

16:01.583 --> 16:02.875
I mean, Sheridan
and the others.

16:02.958 --> 16:05.208
They have this whole
support mechanism.

16:05.292 --> 16:07.167
They draw their salary
from the docking fees

16:07.250 --> 16:08.542
paid by alien ships.

16:08.625 --> 16:11.792
Their meals and clothing
are all free.

16:11.875 --> 16:14.958
But what about
poor Lyta Alexander?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.875
How does she earn a living?

16:16.958 --> 16:20.958
I mean, being a freedom fighter,
a force for good, it's..

16:21.042 --> 16:22.542
...it's a wonderful thing.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.375
You get to make
your own hours

16:24.458 --> 16:26.875
looks good on a resume..

16:26.958 --> 16:28.875
...but the pay..

16:28.958 --> 16:30.083
...sucks.

16:30.167 --> 16:33.167
So, I'm prepared
to make a deal with you.

16:34.292 --> 16:37.000
- I won't go back.
- I'm not asking you to.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.792
This is what I was thinking.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.750
I can slide your name
off the rogue list.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.708
We have a category
for deep cover agents.

16:46.792 --> 16:50.375
Only a few of us
have access to it.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.250
I can add your name
without too much trouble.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.750
You'd be Corps
in name only.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.083
You can do as you want.

16:56.167 --> 16:58.792
You'd be able to work again,
make a living.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.917
In exchange for what?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.458
Well, you'd have to wear
the symbol, of course

17:03.542 --> 17:04.917
and the gloves.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.458
They're more than just
part of the uniform.

17:06.542 --> 17:09.000
They're part of the discipline.
It's who we are.

17:09.083 --> 17:13.000
And the usual 10 percent of your
fees would go back to the Corps.

17:14.542 --> 17:16.125
And?

17:16.208 --> 17:17.875
And..

17:17.958 --> 17:21.958
Well, there is just
no delicate way to say this.

17:23.917 --> 17:26.083
I want your body.

17:26.167 --> 17:29.292
What? Are you out of your mind?

17:29.375 --> 17:33.458
[laughing]
That's a very funny question
to ask a telepath..

17:33.542 --> 17:37.125
...since we spend so much of our
time in other people's minds.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.875
I don't want it now, Lyta.

17:39.958 --> 17:42.958
Just when you're not
using it anymore.

17:43.042 --> 17:45.125
After your passing.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.417
This is a power of attorney.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.542
It gives me the right
to your body after your death.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.042
Now, in case you're worried

17:54.125 --> 17:57.083
that I might do something
to speed that process up

17:57.167 --> 17:58.875
clause 14 stipulates that

17:58.958 --> 18:00.792
this contract shall
be null and void

18:00.875 --> 18:03.542
if you die from anything
other than natural causes.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.667
So you see...I'm certainly
taking a risk.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.292
This isn't exactly
a safe neighborhood.

18:09.958 --> 18:11.833
Why?

18:11.917 --> 18:14.000
Because, without your permission

18:14.083 --> 18:16.917
Sheridan would never
give me custody.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.333
Lyta..

18:19.417 --> 18:21.958
...we both know
you've been altered.

18:22.042 --> 18:24.833
I don't know how, but I think
I know by whom.

18:26.208 --> 18:28.833
The Vorlons found some way
to enhance your abilities

18:28.917 --> 18:30.458
didn't they?

18:31.833 --> 18:34.000
'That's something
we can't deal with.'

18:34.083 --> 18:36.250
A P-5 is a P-5 forever.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.333
We can train them to make
the most of their talent

18:38.417 --> 18:39.792
but that's all.

18:41.750 --> 18:45.667
The Vorlons gave you more
than just enhanced abilities.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.208
They've given every telepath

18:47.292 --> 18:49.375
a chance to be more
than what they are.

18:50.625 --> 18:53.292
If that secret
dies with you..

18:53.375 --> 18:54.833
...it's a waste.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.250
Surely even you can see that.

19:00.958 --> 19:03.583
I'm offering you a chance
to put your life back together

19:03.667 --> 19:05.542
on your own terms.

19:05.625 --> 19:07.667
It's not a bad deal.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.292
[dramatic music]

19:16.958 --> 19:19.750
I'd sooner put a bullet
in my brain.

19:25.958 --> 19:27.208
I'll be here a few days

19:27.292 --> 19:30.000
just in case
you change your mind.

19:42.333 --> 19:45.125
(Neroon)
'The religious caste
has agreed to surrender.'

19:45.208 --> 19:47.917
I thought we would meet
down on the planet.

19:48.000 --> 19:48.958
Oh?

19:49.042 --> 19:51.292
The grey council
floated among the stars

19:51.375 --> 19:53.042
cut off from our people.

19:53.125 --> 19:57.375
We need to show that we intend
to do things differently.

19:57.458 --> 20:01.083
I chose the temple of Varenni
for their surrender.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.417
Why there?

20:02.500 --> 20:04.125
That is where disputes
between the castes

20:04.208 --> 20:06.875
were settled in the years
before Valen and the council

20:06.958 --> 20:10.292
where new leaders were selected
during times of war.

20:10.375 --> 20:14.208
It will show that we are
returning to our traditions.

20:14.292 --> 20:16.958
Also it is equipped
to send a record

20:17.042 --> 20:19.750
of their surrender
throughout Minbari.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.292
That will help
to discourage any dissension.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.792
I agree. It will make
for a powerful symbol.

20:25.875 --> 20:27.417
When does the surrender
take place?

20:27.500 --> 20:29.667
As soon as we arrive.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.833
There is one last thing.

20:35.167 --> 20:37.917
Once we've accepted
their surrender

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
what shall we do about Delenn?

20:40.083 --> 20:42.000
I know how she thinks.

20:42.083 --> 20:43.542
She'll go along
with this for now

20:43.625 --> 20:47.542
but in time, she will start
working against us.

20:47.625 --> 20:49.792
She is a threat
to our authority.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.208
Once we have restored peace

20:54.292 --> 20:57.000
she will return to Babylon 5.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.000
I believe we can guarantee
that her ship

20:59.083 --> 21:01.667
will never reach
its destination.

21:08.917 --> 21:09.917
[doorbell beeps]

21:10.000 --> 21:11.042
Yes?

21:12.583 --> 21:14.875
- Hi.
- Zack, hi. Come on in.

21:14.958 --> 21:17.250
I was just having some dinner,
if you care to join me.

21:17.333 --> 21:20.083
I can't. I got to be in
five places at the same time.

21:20.167 --> 21:21.917
Smells great, though.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.375
Besides, I got business here.

21:24.458 --> 21:28.208
'I figured, better I should
do it than some stranger.'

21:28.292 --> 21:31.583
Station resources wants you
to move to smaller quarters.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.167
What?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.583
Why?

21:36.667 --> 21:38.583
I-I just got this
place fixed up.

21:38.667 --> 21:40.500
Until last month,
this place was paid for

21:40.583 --> 21:41.958
by the Vorlon government.

21:42.042 --> 21:45.708
Now they're gone, and you don't
have any regular income.

21:45.792 --> 21:49.083
Now, station needs every credit
we can get our hands on

21:49.167 --> 21:51.333
to bring in supplies
by alternate routes.

21:51.417 --> 21:53.667
After everything I've done
you're just gonna kick me out.

21:53.750 --> 21:55.458
No.

21:55.542 --> 21:57.792
They're not kicking you out.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.833
It's just a move
to F-size quarters.

21:59.917 --> 22:01.667
Now, I know the ones
they're talking about.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.208
They're nice.

22:03.292 --> 22:05.208
- Intimate.
- Small!

22:05.292 --> 22:07.125
Hm.

22:07.208 --> 22:09.333
Alright.

22:09.417 --> 22:12.292
I guess I can work
this out, somehow.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.250
I'm sorry I bit your head off.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.458
You're right, I'd rather
hear it from you

22:17.542 --> 22:19.083
than somebody else.

22:19.958 --> 22:22.458
Good. Good, I'm-I'm glad.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.417
Because, uh

22:28.500 --> 22:30.583
I've got a favor to ask you.

22:30.667 --> 22:33.625
'It might even help you out
a little in return.'

22:33.708 --> 22:35.500
'I'd like to hire you
for a job.'

22:36.708 --> 22:39.125
I want you to scan
Mr. Garibaldi for me.

22:39.208 --> 22:41.667
I assume this is
with his permission.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.583
- Well, not exactly.
- Zack!

22:43.667 --> 22:46.042
Look, ever since he got back
he has not been acting the same

22:46.125 --> 22:48.458
and I need to know
if he's alright upstairs.

22:48.542 --> 22:49.875
I can't do that.

22:49.958 --> 22:51.542
It goes against everything
I've been taught.

22:51.625 --> 22:53.583
It's a complete
invasion of privacy.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.125
Can't you at least poke around
a little bit by accident?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.333
No!

22:58.417 --> 23:00.708
I wish I could help,
but I-I can't.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.583
Maybe if it were
somebody else..

23:02.667 --> 23:05.375
...I don't know,
I-I'd at least think about it.

23:05.458 --> 23:06.833
But Garibaldi

23:06.917 --> 23:08.083
he's the first person I met

23:08.167 --> 23:11.292
when I got here five years ago.

23:11.375 --> 23:15.125
Oh, I need the money,
but I can't do this.

23:15.208 --> 23:17.792
Please don't ask me.

23:21.167 --> 23:22.333
Okay.

23:23.167 --> 23:26.125
I guess I understand.

23:26.208 --> 23:27.625
Look, I'm sorry.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.958
I didn't mean to upset you.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.125
But I had to at least try.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.792
Let me get this straight,
you wanna hire me

23:40.875 --> 23:42.083
to find your dog?

23:42.167 --> 23:43.625
That's right.
And my cat too.

23:43.708 --> 23:45.833
Aha. Yeah, well..

23:45.917 --> 23:48.000
Mr. Adams, this isn't the kind
of thing that I--

23:48.083 --> 23:49.583
I'll pay time and a half.

23:49.667 --> 23:51.125
Turn down. Doggies, kitties..

23:51.208 --> 23:53.375
Hey, they all kind of make
the world go round, don't they?

23:53.458 --> 23:55.833
Anything else I, uh,
should know about them?

23:57.750 --> 24:00.333
They're planning
to take over the galaxy.

24:04.583 --> 24:06.125
Yeah.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.833
Yeah, they always find me.

24:08.917 --> 24:10.583
Hey, I was wondering
when you were gonna be

24:10.667 --> 24:12.958
getting around
to coming to see me.

24:13.042 --> 24:14.500
What can I do for you?

24:14.583 --> 24:16.583
Uh, I need a job.

24:16.667 --> 24:18.000
Short, sweet, to the point.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.458
I wish more of my clients
were like you.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.708
Please, sit down.

24:21.792 --> 24:23.417
I'm almost out of money
and they're about

24:23.500 --> 24:25.917
to kick me
out of my quarters.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.875
I can't keep taking handouts
from the others

24:27.958 --> 24:30.208
but without the Psi Corps
to back me up

24:30.292 --> 24:32.583
people I wanna work for
won't hire me.

24:32.667 --> 24:34.625
And the only people
who might hire me, I--

24:34.708 --> 24:37.833
- You don't trust.
- Exactly.

24:37.917 --> 24:40.208
I don't have anywhere else
left to turn.

24:40.292 --> 24:44.083
[sighs]
Lyta, the way I work,
I don't use telepaths.

24:44.167 --> 24:47.458
I...I don't trust them.
I never have.

24:47.542 --> 24:49.208
I know.

24:49.292 --> 24:52.250
I just hoped that by now,
I'd proven myself enough--

24:52.333 --> 24:54.292
However, however

24:54.375 --> 24:56.750
if I hire you,
I annoy Bester.

24:56.833 --> 24:59.167
I like the thought of that.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.208
What's your empathic range?

25:01.292 --> 25:03.625
Well, officially..

25:03.708 --> 25:05.042
...20-25 meters.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.833
Unofficially.

25:06.917 --> 25:08.792
Further. Much.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.000
Interesting.

25:10.083 --> 25:11.333
See, I just started
working for this client

25:11.417 --> 25:13.250
who has me bringing him
stuff in on the sly.

25:13.333 --> 25:15.417
Now, he doesn't wanna get
noticed and neither do I.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.125
But the problem is when
you don't have a lookout

25:17.208 --> 25:20.125
or someone to watch your back
you get noticed.

25:20.208 --> 25:22.167
What I need is someone who can
see around the corners

25:22.250 --> 25:25.333
and, well...you're
the next best thing.

25:27.500 --> 25:29.167
Alright, look, it's gonna have
to be a small retainer

25:29.250 --> 25:30.417
till we see how
things work out

25:30.500 --> 25:31.542
and it's coming out
of what I get

25:31.625 --> 25:32.792
so it's not gonna be much.

25:32.875 --> 25:36.750
(Bester)
'Well, well, Mr. Garibaldi.'

25:36.833 --> 25:39.417
I heard you'd retired,
but I didn't believe it.

25:39.500 --> 25:41.542
Not retired. Just went
independent, that's all.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.458
Why? You looking to hire
somebody to find out

25:43.542 --> 25:46.083
what happened
to your personality?

25:46.167 --> 25:49.792
Always quick with the
Mr. Garibaldi.

25:49.875 --> 25:53.625
Sadly, you're no longer
worth my attention.

25:55.958 --> 25:57.542
Good day.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.292
Ms. Alexander.

26:05.083 --> 26:06.708
Hey, what are you..

26:06.792 --> 26:08.042
What?

26:08.125 --> 26:09.958
- He scanned you.
- Are you sure?

26:10.042 --> 26:11.375
I'm positive.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.583
[dramatic music]

26:16.708 --> 26:19.625
Hey, I told you
to stay out of my head!

26:19.708 --> 26:21.292
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:21.375 --> 26:24.333
What are you after? Why are you
doing this to me? Talk to me!

26:24.417 --> 26:26.792
Come on! Let me go!
He scanned me!

26:28.167 --> 26:29.167
Come on.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.667
[grunting]

26:34.500 --> 26:36.458
[indistinct chatter]

26:45.083 --> 26:46.125
Hi.

26:47.333 --> 26:49.042
[intense music]

27:01.292 --> 27:03.500
This is a terrible day, Delenn.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.333
I never thought
I'd see it come.

27:05.417 --> 27:08.042
The day is not yet
over, Lennier.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.208
But we have already
agreed to the surrender.

27:10.292 --> 27:11.542
I know.

27:13.667 --> 27:15.958
I want you to have this,
Lennier.

27:16.042 --> 27:18.208
Keep this with you
until we are done.

27:18.292 --> 27:20.208
All the instructions
are inside.

27:20.292 --> 27:21.917
Instructions?

27:23.958 --> 27:25.000
It's time.

27:38.125 --> 27:40.833
Delenn, of the family Mir.

27:40.917 --> 27:44.375
I greet you in the name
of the warrior caste.

27:44.458 --> 27:46.875
Shakiri, of the family Kort.

27:46.958 --> 27:49.792
I greet you in the name
of the religious caste.

27:49.875 --> 27:53.083
I regret that we have been
brought together here

27:53.167 --> 27:55.417
in this sacred place

27:55.500 --> 27:58.625
by such unfortunate events.

27:58.708 --> 28:03.750
But this day will mark a new
beginning for our people.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.417
The struggle between us

28:05.500 --> 28:08.333
was terrible, was hard..

28:09.208 --> 28:10.875
...was inevitable.

28:10.958 --> 28:13.750
But now it is over.

28:13.833 --> 28:18.000
Do you speak for the whole
of the religious caste, Delenn?

28:18.083 --> 28:19.333
I do.

28:19.417 --> 28:23.000
And what message do you bring
for us today?

28:25.792 --> 28:29.333
The religious caste surrenders.

28:38.042 --> 28:41.417
The religious caste surrenders.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.042
You have all heard it.

28:43.125 --> 28:46.458
The struggle between us is over.

28:46.542 --> 28:50.583
Now we can begin to rebuild
our great cities

28:50.667 --> 28:53.750
until they are even
greater than before.

28:53.833 --> 28:57.292
Now, we step out into
the light of a new day.

28:58.417 --> 29:01.458
'Now, we rebuild
the grey council'

29:01.542 --> 29:02.792
into a warrior's council.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.833
(Delenn)
'Excuse me?'

29:06.333 --> 29:07.542
Yes?

29:07.625 --> 29:09.458
I said that we surrendered.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.917
I did not say that we gave up
our sovereign rights

29:12.042 --> 29:14.167
to form a new government.

29:14.250 --> 29:16.292
Dukhat said that
in every battle

29:16.375 --> 29:19.833
one side or the other
must surrender eventually.

29:19.917 --> 29:21.500
It is the natural order
of things.

29:21.583 --> 29:24.542
There is no dishonor
in that, no shame.

29:24.625 --> 29:27.917
We recognize the superior forces
of the warrior caste.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.375
We have, after all, spent
several centuries arming you

29:31.458 --> 29:33.750
helping you learn
the art of combat.

29:33.833 --> 29:35.500
What threat are we
against that?

29:35.583 --> 29:38.542
Then you acknowledge.
We are stronger!

29:38.625 --> 29:41.875
Stronger, yes.
But wiser?

29:44.833 --> 29:46.667
For a thousand years

29:46.750 --> 29:50.417
we've guided our people
through wisdom, not arms.

29:50.500 --> 29:53.042
Will we set that
aside so quickly?

29:53.125 --> 29:56.292
You who are watching here
and across Minbari

29:56.375 --> 29:57.500
you know this place.

29:57.583 --> 29:59.417
You know its history.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.750
This is where we chose
our leaders before Valen.

30:02.833 --> 30:06.792
This is where many of us served,
and many of us died.

30:08.708 --> 30:11.417
The ancients understood
that in war

30:11.500 --> 30:13.542
it is always the young
and the powerless

30:13.625 --> 30:15.000
who are sent off to fight.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.750
Sent by leaders and warriors
and generals

30:17.833 --> 30:20.417
who are not themselves
engaged in the battle

30:20.500 --> 30:23.167
who do not bleed
on the front lines..

30:23.250 --> 30:27.708
...who do not die alone on
the cold and friendless night.

30:27.792 --> 30:31.583
But here, in this place,
that changed.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.667
What are you playing at?

30:40.750 --> 30:44.917
If the warrior caste has set
aside the wisdom of Valen

30:45.000 --> 30:47.250
if they wish to return
to the old ways

30:47.333 --> 30:50.625
then they must honor the laws
set down by the ancients.

30:52.292 --> 30:54.958
The leaders
of each warring caste

30:55.042 --> 30:57.250
would step into the circle.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.750
The starfire wheel would open

30:59.833 --> 31:02.833
and its fire would
begin to consume them.

31:02.917 --> 31:05.083
Those who did not
deserve to rule

31:05.167 --> 31:07.458
who would not sacrifice
themselves as they asked

31:07.542 --> 31:09.083
others to do on their behalf

31:09.167 --> 31:11.542
would escape the fire.

31:11.625 --> 31:14.250
The sacrifice of the one
who remained

31:14.333 --> 31:16.125
who believed so much
in his caste

31:16.208 --> 31:19.042
that he would lay down
his life for them.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.458
That would determine which caste
would be dominant among us.

31:22.542 --> 31:23.667
This is a violation of--

31:23.750 --> 31:27.000
It is the tradition
of our people!

31:27.083 --> 31:29.542
The warrior caste
began the war.

31:29.625 --> 31:32.125
The religious caste
has ended it.

31:32.208 --> 31:33.875
And now we say

31:33.958 --> 31:36.792
we are willing to endure
the starfire wheel

31:36.875 --> 31:39.167
for the good of our people.

31:39.250 --> 31:41.833
If the warrior caste
will not do the same

31:41.917 --> 31:43.875
then you are not
fit to lead.

31:43.958 --> 31:45.667
[rumbling]

31:46.708 --> 31:48.667
[dramatic music]

31:56.708 --> 31:59.667
Valen said

31:59.750 --> 32:01.958
"Will you
follow me into fire?"

32:04.833 --> 32:06.083
Will you?

32:18.083 --> 32:20.500
Delenn, don't do this.

32:20.583 --> 32:24.000
What's done is done.
I cannot leave the circle now.

32:24.083 --> 32:27.292
You have my instructions.
Carry them out.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.458
Shakiri. You do not follow.

32:35.542 --> 32:38.583
Does the warrior caste
concede leadership?

32:38.667 --> 32:39.667
This proves nothing.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.875
Our entire world
is watching, Shakiri.

32:42.958 --> 32:45.500
If you believe so much
in your caste

32:45.583 --> 32:48.208
step into the circle
and die for them.

32:48.292 --> 32:51.500
Or is it easier for you
to kill my caste?

32:51.583 --> 32:54.042
Easier to send others
out to die for you?

32:58.125 --> 33:00.542
This is madness! I refuse--

33:00.625 --> 33:04.375
You said that a warrior
does not fear death, Shakiri.

33:05.667 --> 33:06.708
Neroon? What are you--

33:06.792 --> 33:07.875
You said that "Death was only

33:07.958 --> 33:09.125
one of two consequences

33:09.208 --> 33:10.667
"neither valued nor feared

33:10.750 --> 33:12.125
"above the other.

33:12.208 --> 33:15.750
Death is merely a release
from our obligations."

33:15.833 --> 33:17.458
Why then
are you afraid, Shakiri?

33:17.542 --> 33:20.417
Have you put your own importance
above our people?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.042
Do you take their side?

33:22.125 --> 33:25.583
I speak for my people.
Who do you speak for?

33:25.667 --> 33:28.458
And what are you
willing to do?

33:28.542 --> 33:31.083
They are waiting
for your answer.

33:32.500 --> 33:34.458
[music continues]

33:53.042 --> 33:54.917
[groaning]

33:57.667 --> 33:59.375
Delenn..

33:59.458 --> 34:01.417
...we can walk out together

34:01.500 --> 34:03.042
share the power.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.833
No one will
speak against us.

34:05.917 --> 34:07.167
No!

34:08.625 --> 34:09.750
There are other ways.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.042
Then you should
have explored them

34:11.125 --> 34:13.042
before you tore
our people apart!

34:16.583 --> 34:18.292
No!

34:18.375 --> 34:20.083
No-o!

34:21.583 --> 34:23.042
[groaning]

34:29.875 --> 34:31.500
I do not understand.

34:31.583 --> 34:34.125
When we were aboard your ship,
when she proposed this

34:34.208 --> 34:37.958
Delenn told me she would leave
the circle after he did.

34:38.042 --> 34:40.625
'Why does she not come out?'

34:40.708 --> 34:42.667
(Lennier)
'She's making her point'

34:42.750 --> 34:44.792
for all our people.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.167
For the world.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.083
No-o!

35:17.250 --> 35:19.792
I was born..

35:19.875 --> 35:21.750
...warrior caste.

35:22.875 --> 35:25.500
But I see now

35:25.583 --> 35:27.500
the calling of my heart..

35:28.750 --> 35:30.208
is religious.

35:31.917 --> 35:34.708
The war is over!

35:35.833 --> 35:37.792
Listen to her!

35:39.458 --> 35:41.417
Listen!

35:44.125 --> 35:46.458
[explosion]

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
[instrumental music]

36:04.083 --> 36:06.125
Ugh. That's enough.

36:06.208 --> 36:07.625
Oh, what the frag?

36:07.708 --> 36:11.917
I am so tired of this damn..
Argh! Lights! What?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.625
[automated response]
'Message for you
from William Ed--'

36:13.708 --> 36:15.250
Put him through!

36:15.333 --> 36:16.708
(Edgars on phone)
'Good morning, Mr. Garibaldi.'

36:16.792 --> 36:18.250
Mr. Edgars,
you gotta stop--

36:18.333 --> 36:20.750
'I understand you just
hired a telepath.'

36:20.833 --> 36:21.750
Yeah?

36:21.833 --> 36:22.917
'And you're paying her'

36:23.000 --> 36:25.500
'out of the retainer I pay you?'

36:25.583 --> 36:26.625
Yeah, that-that's right. How--

36:26.708 --> 36:28.333
'How is not important.'

36:28.417 --> 36:30.792
'You're to fire her,
effective immediately.'

36:30.875 --> 36:32.542
What? Why?

36:32.625 --> 36:34.875
'I do not trust telepaths.'

36:34.958 --> 36:36.708
'I will not have
them near me'

36:36.792 --> 36:39.292
'or anyone who works
for me at this level.'

36:40.667 --> 36:42.917
But this-this serum
that you've been working on

36:43.000 --> 36:44.958
it's supposed to help telepaths.

36:45.042 --> 36:46.542
If you don't wanna help them,
then why the hell--

36:46.625 --> 36:49.667
'I may develop a serum
to help lab rats.'

36:49.750 --> 36:53.625
'That does not mean I want to
employ them, even second-hand.'

36:53.708 --> 36:56.625
'Mr. Garibaldi, I am paying you
a lot of money.'

36:56.708 --> 36:58.958
'If you cannot meet the terms
of our employment'

36:59.042 --> 37:01.833
'I can always
find someone else.'

37:01.917 --> 37:04.125
'I have nothing
against her personally'

37:04.208 --> 37:06.417
'but as long as you
are working for me'

37:06.500 --> 37:08.750
'she cannot work for you.'

37:08.833 --> 37:11.208
'Tell me which way
you want it.'

37:13.375 --> 37:15.250
[instrumental music]

37:26.042 --> 37:28.667
(Bester)
Personal log, Bester, Al.

37:28.750 --> 37:31.667
August 3rd, 2261.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.292
By provoking Mr. Garibaldi

37:34.375 --> 37:35.875
I've put him
even further at odds

37:35.958 --> 37:37.333
with his former associates

37:37.417 --> 37:40.000
and further on the path
I need him to follow.

37:41.792 --> 37:44.375
What I came here
to get, I got..

37:47.083 --> 37:49.292
...even her.

37:49.375 --> 37:51.875
Guess you could
call it a bank shot.

37:51.958 --> 37:55.583
Yes. I've had a nice day.

38:06.833 --> 38:10.250
I still think you should wait a
while longer before doing this.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.000
You're not yet
fully healed.

38:12.083 --> 38:15.042
The other castes are waiting
to see what I do.

38:15.125 --> 38:18.917
The longer we wait, the more
questioning may turn to fear.

38:20.292 --> 38:21.875
Is everything ready?

38:21.958 --> 38:24.042
Yes, as soon
as you enter

38:24.125 --> 38:26.708
the record of this will be
relayed all across Minbari.

38:29.958 --> 38:31.958
Then let us get this over with.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.708
Today, we rebuild

38:57.792 --> 38:59.750
what was broken.

38:59.833 --> 39:03.208
Today, we restore
the grey council.

39:04.292 --> 39:06.083
I summon the nine

39:06.167 --> 39:08.583
as Valen called
them together long ago.

39:10.333 --> 39:13.250
Dhaliri, of the
religious caste.

39:14.833 --> 39:17.875
Mazetsch, of the warrior caste.

39:19.583 --> 39:23.625
Burlee, of the religious caste.

39:23.708 --> 39:26.375
Shakat, of the warrior caste.

39:28.208 --> 39:31.083
In the past,
it has been our tradition

39:31.167 --> 39:33.042
to seek balance.

39:33.125 --> 39:35.875
We have called three
from each caste

39:35.958 --> 39:39.500
worker, warrior, religious.

39:39.583 --> 39:42.708
But now, that changes.

39:42.792 --> 39:46.875
I call forth, Durlan

39:46.958 --> 39:49.042
Katz

39:49.125 --> 39:51.042
Zakat

39:51.125 --> 39:54.833
Nur, and Varenn

39:54.917 --> 39:57.042
of the worker caste.

39:58.792 --> 40:01.958
You had forgotten the
worker caste, hadn't you?

40:02.042 --> 40:03.958
'When our two sides fight'

40:04.042 --> 40:06.042
'they are the ones
caught in the middle'

40:06.125 --> 40:08.833
'forgotten until
it is their time to serve'

40:08.917 --> 40:11.792
to build, and to die.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.125
They build the temples
we pray in

40:14.208 --> 40:16.458
the ships you fight in.

40:16.542 --> 40:19.417
They look to us
to guide their hands.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.500
But prayers are fleeting
and wars forgotten.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.875
What is built endures.

40:24.958 --> 40:27.667
They do not wish
to conquer, or convert.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.000
Only to build the future.

40:30.083 --> 40:33.583
And now, they will
have that chance.

40:33.667 --> 40:36.208
The religious caste
and the warrior caste

40:36.292 --> 40:38.333
will advise and counsel.

40:38.417 --> 40:41.542
We will serve,
as is proper.

40:41.625 --> 40:45.125
Religion and war must act
in the service of the people

40:45.208 --> 40:47.167
not the other way around.

40:48.958 --> 40:50.917
And this place..

40:53.042 --> 40:56.917
...this place is reserved
in memory of Neroon..

40:58.417 --> 41:02.000
...until the day it is taken
by the one who is to come.

41:04.417 --> 41:06.250
You are

41:06.333 --> 41:09.375
the heart, the hands

41:09.458 --> 41:12.208
and the voice of our people.

41:12.292 --> 41:15.417
Judge wisely and well.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.375
[doorbell beeps]

41:28.458 --> 41:30.000
Just a second.

41:30.083 --> 41:31.958
Come.

41:32.042 --> 41:33.667
- Sorry, I was in--
- The bastards!

41:33.750 --> 41:36.167
Those cold-hearted rat bastards.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.708
When I heard about it,
I thought it was just a rumor.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.125
I mean, we get
so many of them.

41:39.208 --> 41:42.083
Oh, God, John, I just want
to grab them and just..

41:42.167 --> 41:43.375
This is it. This is it!

41:43.458 --> 41:45.000
What? What is it?

41:45.083 --> 41:46.208
What?

41:46.292 --> 41:48.083
Here, this was recorded
by a transport

41:48.167 --> 41:50.417
bringing relief supplies
to Proxima 3.

41:52.250 --> 41:54.875
As soon as this destroyer
came through the gate

41:54.958 --> 41:57.500
the other ships identified
themselves as commercial liners.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.375
They were carrying the sick
and the wounded

41:59.458 --> 42:01.417
from where President Clark's
been hitting them.

42:01.500 --> 42:04.083
Women, children, the-the sick,
the infirm..

42:04.167 --> 42:07.542
Two thousand civilians per ship,
crammed in like sardines.

42:10.042 --> 42:11.375
(John)
'My God.'

42:13.292 --> 42:15.625
Ten thousand civilians
whose only crime

42:15.708 --> 42:17.792
was trying to get out
of the damn killing zone.

42:17.875 --> 42:20.333
I am putting this on VOR
as soon as I calm down.

42:23.292 --> 42:26.292
This madness has
gone on long enough.

42:26.375 --> 42:27.625
I don't care
if we're ready yet.

42:27.708 --> 42:29.792
I don't care if we're
outnumbered or outgunned.

42:29.875 --> 42:32.667
I don't care what
ISN says about us.

42:32.750 --> 42:34.958
This stops and it stops now.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.375
Now if Earth wants
to declare war on us

42:38.458 --> 42:41.417
then it is time that
we took the war to Clark.

42:42.375 --> 42:45.333
You tell the others..

42:45.417 --> 42:47.167
...starting right now.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.250
We fight back
and we fight back hard.

42:49.333 --> 42:50.792
I thought you were looking
for some other way

42:50.875 --> 42:52.292
than firing at our own ships.

42:52.375 --> 42:53.958
They were following orders.

42:54.042 --> 42:56.375
Any crew that executes
an order like that

42:56.458 --> 42:58.083
is guilty of war crimes.

42:58.167 --> 43:00.792
And they deserve
whatever they get.

43:00.875 --> 43:02.875
Now, we're riding in, Susan.

43:02.958 --> 43:05.625
Anybody who wants to
defect and join us, fine.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.542
If they get in our way,
we'll knock them down.

43:07.625 --> 43:10.333
If they kill one of our ships,
we'll kill three of theirs

43:10.417 --> 43:11.917
and we keep going.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.292
We never slow down
and we won't stop.

43:15.375 --> 43:18.792
Now, we're going after
the colonies, then Mars..

43:19.958 --> 43:21.375
...then Earth.

43:23.917 --> 43:26.292
And God help anybody
who gets in our way.
