WEBVTT

00:41.666 --> 00:43.968
- My name is Dimitri Asna,
and I'm a graduate

00:44.006 --> 00:46.843
of the All-Union institute
of Cinematography in Moscow.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.188
I was entrusted
by our great leader,

00:51.225 --> 00:52.625
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin,

00:52.661 --> 00:54.656
to film the heroic deeds

00:54.700 --> 00:56.899
of a distinguished
reconnaissance unit

00:56.940 --> 00:58.934
under the command
of Sergeant Novikov.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.479
I am proud to be a part
of this mission

01:02.521 --> 01:04.185
in the Great Patriotic War.

01:06.899 --> 01:09.873
Long live motherland,
and long live Czarevitch Stalin.

02:36.468 --> 02:38.439
For you.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.563
- Very good, Seryosha.
Very good.

03:03.606 --> 03:04.835
Very strong.

03:04.875 --> 03:07.404
Ivan.
Ivan, don't...

03:07.449 --> 03:08.612
Very good.
Look where you go.

03:08.653 --> 03:10.486
Don't trip up.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.552
Vanya, yes, very good.
Very good.

03:12.596 --> 03:14.760
No, too much.
Too much, Vanya.

03:14.801 --> 03:17.273
Sacha!
Hurry up there!

03:17.308 --> 03:19.439
I need to use the other camera.

03:23.425 --> 03:25.727
How many times must I tell you,
eh?

03:25.765 --> 03:27.257
Be careful with it!

03:34.420 --> 03:36.392
Give me.

03:36.426 --> 03:38.056
Turn it on.
Give me.

03:38.097 --> 03:40.432
Give me.

03:40.469 --> 03:42.269
Turn it on.
Give me.

03:57.213 --> 03:58.877
- There is the sniper's nest.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.615
It's crucial
that we destroy this nest.

04:00.655 --> 04:03.025
It's a potential death trap
for our advancing troops.

04:03.062 --> 04:04.190
Vassili, Alexei,

04:04.232 --> 04:05.759
you flank it
from the right and left.

04:05.803 --> 04:07.363
Ivan and I
will divert attention.

04:07.406 --> 04:09.104
Let's get as much gear off
as we can.

04:09.145 --> 04:11.777
We need to be light.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.222
Sacha, you stay here,

04:14.258 --> 04:16.091
and you guard the gear, huh?

04:23.917 --> 04:24.943
- Take cover!
Kill him!

04:24.986 --> 04:26.751
Kill him!

04:32.807 --> 04:34.036
Grenade!

04:34.076 --> 04:35.569
- Whoa!
- Grenade!

05:09.671 --> 05:11.641
- Ah, shit!
God...

05:13.814 --> 05:15.182
Fuck off, Dima.

05:16.454 --> 05:19.258
- Um, can you go behind me?

05:19.296 --> 05:21.598
I can't see a thing.

05:33.132 --> 05:34.796
Jesus Christ...

05:36.307 --> 05:37.742
- Sir!

05:37.777 --> 05:38.940
Over here!

05:41.320 --> 05:43.314
- Keep the fucking noise down,
boy!

05:51.380 --> 05:53.179
- What the fuck?

05:53.217 --> 05:54.847
- Ooh...

05:54.889 --> 05:56.689
- Fucking hooligan.

06:06.519 --> 06:08.011
- I don't give a shit.

06:09.427 --> 06:11.261
We're here to help our comrades.

06:12.602 --> 06:14.095
Let's go.

06:19.888 --> 06:22.690
- Bear Cobra 3-1-9
calling Mother.

06:22.728 --> 06:24.164
Do you read me?
Over.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.709
Do you read me?
Over.

06:28.745 --> 06:31.547
Bear Cobra 3-1-9
calling Mother.

06:31.585 --> 06:33.648
Do you read me?
Over.

06:41.077 --> 06:43.914
Dima, you think you got
some good shots today, huh?

06:48.263 --> 06:51.065
- Can I ask you a few questions,

06:51.103 --> 06:53.598
for the folks back home
in Russia?

06:57.988 --> 06:59.788
You don't sound Russian.

06:59.826 --> 07:01.956
Where are you from?

07:01.998 --> 07:04.801
- Krakow, Poland.

07:04.839 --> 07:07.175
I escaped east
when the Nazis invaded.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.242
Here.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.970
She is why I'm here.

07:19.378 --> 07:21.873
Seryosha, get over here.

07:28.902 --> 07:31.033
- You think it's worth it?

07:31.075 --> 07:32.770
- Maybe.

08:29.313 --> 08:30.440
- Dima, it's only...

08:32.217 --> 08:34.846
- Moscow Jewboy!
Where are you?

08:36.388 --> 08:38.789
You're a liberator!

08:40.227 --> 08:42.388
- You Polish cunt!

08:42.429 --> 08:45.958
You are going straight
to military tribunal!

08:46.001 --> 08:47.468
Give me the camera!

08:47.503 --> 08:50.495
If you don't get off
that fucking bicycle...

08:52.809 --> 08:54.436
Sacha!

08:54.477 --> 08:55.945
You drunken...

09:39.667 --> 09:41.465
- This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

09:41.503 --> 09:44.097
We are trapped.

09:44.139 --> 09:46.472
Does anyone read me?
Over.

09:50.581 --> 09:52.549
This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.711
We are trapped.

09:54.752 --> 09:56.583
Does anyone read me?
Over.

10:00.926 --> 10:02.827
- Misha?
- This is Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

10:02.862 --> 10:04.455
- Misha, I've got something.

10:10.906 --> 10:13.807
Hello?
Tiger Bear 3-0-3?

10:13.842 --> 10:16.310
We read you.
Over.

10:16.345 --> 10:18.314
- We are trapped.
We can't hold out much longer.

10:18.348 --> 10:21.146
Our position
is 51-17-28 north

10:21.184 --> 10:24.622
by 13-22-04 east.

10:24.656 --> 10:26.055
Do you read me?

10:26.090 --> 10:27.718
- Hello?
Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.728
What is your situation?
Over.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.229
- We can't hold out much longer.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.632
Our position
is 51-17-28 north by 13...

10:34.668 --> 10:36.465
- They can't hear us.

10:43.746 --> 10:45.078
- What one is it?

10:47.050 --> 10:50.987
- Some mining village
in the middle of nowhere.

10:51.022 --> 10:52.819
We're not far.

10:52.857 --> 10:55.827
If we get a move on,
we could be there by noon.

10:55.861 --> 10:58.888
- Don't you think it's strange?

10:58.932 --> 11:00.900
Who is Tiger Bear?

11:00.934 --> 11:03.836
I thought we were
the only reconnaissance.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.668
- They're Russians...

11:05.706 --> 11:06.798
Our boys...

11:06.840 --> 11:07.865
And they need help.

11:07.909 --> 11:11.003
What more do you need to know?

11:12.614 --> 11:15.414
You better inform Mother.

11:15.452 --> 11:16.919
- I wish I could.

11:16.954 --> 11:18.751
That crazy message

11:18.789 --> 11:21.122
is the only thing I've received
for two days.

11:23.227 --> 11:26.288
- Dima, pack your stuff away.

11:26.332 --> 11:28.857
We won't wait for you.

11:43.252 --> 11:46.711
- Eh?
Here's one, shot already, eh?

11:46.756 --> 11:48.726
Fucking fritzie.

12:11.588 --> 12:12.953
- Let me...

12:14.925 --> 12:17.655
Ugh...

12:31.178 --> 12:32.840
- Shit!

12:32.881 --> 12:34.473
Shit.
Damn you!

12:37.720 --> 12:38.846
- What's going on?

12:38.888 --> 12:40.719
- Nothing.
Nothing.

12:40.756 --> 12:42.246
Nothing is going on.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.754
- Do me a favor
and stay with the squad.

13:02.716 --> 13:04.514
- Is that it?

13:04.553 --> 13:05.593
- There's a lot of damage.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.611
There's been fighting here.

13:07.656 --> 13:10.023
Do you see anything?

13:10.059 --> 13:11.720
- Nothing.

13:11.761 --> 13:12.854
No Russians.

13:12.896 --> 13:14.557
No Germans.

13:14.598 --> 13:16.396
Not even a stinking goat.

13:16.434 --> 13:18.231
- All right.

13:18.269 --> 13:20.238
We're going through the trees

13:20.272 --> 13:22.433
very slowly, huh?

13:24.076 --> 13:27.536
And you stay at the back

13:27.582 --> 13:30.050
and keep out of the fucking way.

14:19.378 --> 14:20.607
- Dima!

14:20.647 --> 14:22.171
Come on.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.431
Get down, you idiot!

14:52.152 --> 14:53.813
- I don't get it.

14:55.656 --> 14:58.454
That's artillery damage,

14:58.492 --> 15:01.258
not aircraft.

15:01.297 --> 15:05.233
We don't have artillery
within 50 kilometers of here.

15:05.268 --> 15:06.599
Who did this?

15:08.105 --> 15:11.234
- Let's move down to the church
and take it from there.

15:11.276 --> 15:12.436
Move.

15:41.713 --> 15:44.478
- I don't care who did this.

15:44.517 --> 15:46.848
They're bastards,
whoever they are.

15:50.823 --> 15:53.292
- Oh, God.

15:53.327 --> 15:56.057
They are nuns.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.634
- Oh, God.
One is still alive.

16:04.668 --> 16:05.930
Who did this, huh?

16:05.969 --> 16:07.094
Who did this to you?

16:07.136 --> 16:08.433
It's the Nazis, right?

16:08.470 --> 16:10.403
Say it's the Nazis.
Say it!

16:10.438 --> 16:14.339
- For God's sake, Dima.
- Say it!

16:14.374 --> 16:15.841
Say... say... say it.

16:53.934 --> 16:56.196
- Whoa!

17:05.741 --> 17:07.038
- Are you all right?

17:07.076 --> 17:09.306
- I fell into a fucking grave,

17:09.345 --> 17:11.175
but I'll be all right.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.225
- Hey!

17:41.265 --> 17:42.925
- What was that?

18:34.266 --> 18:36.426
- What kind of church is this?

18:37.902 --> 18:40.233
- This is more like a factory.

18:43.305 --> 18:44.669
- Fuck...

18:53.345 --> 18:54.812
Sacha!

18:54.846 --> 18:56.473
None of your stupid games here,
huh?

18:56.514 --> 18:58.504
It could be dangerous!

19:05.520 --> 19:06.817
- Sacha.

19:06.854 --> 19:07.912
Sacha, go down there,

19:07.955 --> 19:10.717
see if you can find
a light switch.

19:10.756 --> 19:11.814
- Why?

19:11.857 --> 19:13.688
- Because we need more light.

19:16.994 --> 19:18.484
Go.

19:41.944 --> 19:43.433
Sash...

19:43.479 --> 19:44.944
Sash!
- What?

19:44.978 --> 19:47.708
- See if you can get
the generator started.

19:47.748 --> 19:48.805
- Why?

19:48.848 --> 19:50.678
- Don't argue.
Just do it.

20:01.223 --> 20:02.554
One...

20:03.658 --> 20:04.716
Ugh.

20:10.763 --> 20:13.526
- Hey, camera-with-legs,
come over here.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.394
Hey, look at what we have found.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.174
- What's going on?

20:30.209 --> 20:32.040
Sacha, is that you?

20:37.179 --> 20:38.374
- Misha...

20:44.585 --> 20:45.711
- Don't you think this is...

20:45.752 --> 20:46.962
- No, no, no, no.
Don't touch it!

20:46.986 --> 20:48.510
Don't touch it!

20:49.589 --> 20:50.612
- Uh!

21:18.307 --> 21:20.831
- What the...

21:24.444 --> 21:25.503
- Vassili, don't...

21:25.546 --> 21:27.034
- Don't touch it, Vassili!

21:30.449 --> 21:32.245
- Can you hear me?

21:32.283 --> 21:33.340
I think it's blind.

21:33.383 --> 21:36.352
I don't think it can see us,
huh?

21:41.456 --> 21:43.946
What are you?

21:43.991 --> 21:45.355
Can you hear me?

21:47.126 --> 21:48.526
- Let's put you
out of your miser...

21:49.494 --> 21:50.984
- Misha!

21:51.029 --> 21:52.052
- Novikov!

21:52.096 --> 21:54.087
- Get it!

21:54.131 --> 21:55.427
- Vassili!
Vassili, get it!

21:58.267 --> 22:00.928
Get it out!
Get it out!

22:00.968 --> 22:02.128
- Get it off!
Get it off me!

22:02.169 --> 22:05.364
Get it off me!

22:06.906 --> 22:07.906
- Kill it!
Kill it!

22:07.940 --> 22:09.201
Get it off him!
Get it off!

22:17.245 --> 22:20.180
- Oh, my God, Misha.

22:22.082 --> 22:23.344
Just relax.

22:23.384 --> 22:24.475
Just stay still.

22:24.517 --> 22:26.450
Here, here.

22:26.485 --> 22:30.045
Okay, I'm not going anywhere.

22:30.087 --> 22:31.520
I'm not going anywhere.

22:31.556 --> 22:33.614
- Don't move.
Don't move.

22:33.657 --> 22:35.988
Sacha, for God's sakes,
turn that thing off!

23:05.277 --> 23:06.937
Ugh!

23:37.165 --> 23:38.791
- Calling Mother.
Do you read me?

23:38.832 --> 23:39.992
Over.

23:41.668 --> 23:43.498
Do you read me?
Over.

23:49.173 --> 23:51.970
We're being jammed.

23:52.008 --> 23:54.475
It's the only explanation.

23:54.509 --> 23:56.374
It's been days
since I got a scratch

23:56.411 --> 23:57.672
out of the damn thing.

23:57.712 --> 24:00.647
- What if we used the tower?

24:00.681 --> 24:03.409
- That's not a bad idea.

24:03.449 --> 24:05.610
Not a bad idea.

24:06.918 --> 24:08.715
- Vasja.
Vasja.

24:08.753 --> 24:10.481
We are here now.

24:10.520 --> 24:11.646
You heard that Mayday.

24:11.688 --> 24:13.211
Our boys need help.

24:13.255 --> 24:14.722
- Where the fuck are they,
then, eh?

24:14.757 --> 24:17.850
- Listen, we need to search
the village properly.

24:17.892 --> 24:20.325
Otherwise,
Novikov has died for nothing.

24:21.695 --> 24:24.595
He's right, Vasja.

24:24.631 --> 24:25.928
Take the others.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.565
I'll stay here with Sacha
and their gear.

24:27.599 --> 24:29.293
Go to the village,
find someone, anyone,

24:29.333 --> 24:31.631
who can tell us
what is going on here.

24:31.669 --> 24:33.659
- Correct me if I'm wrong,
Seryosha,

24:33.703 --> 24:36.102
but I'm next in command
after Novikov.

24:36.138 --> 24:37.537
- I don't think so.

24:37.573 --> 24:38.870
Look at the stripes.

24:38.906 --> 24:40.703
- Who gives a fuck
about stripes?

24:40.742 --> 24:42.542
I have been with this unit
longer than anyone.

24:42.576 --> 24:44.510
- That doesn't mean
you're in charge, Vasja!

24:44.544 --> 24:45.840
- Oh, no?

24:45.878 --> 24:47.709
Well, let's ask the others.

24:47.747 --> 24:49.043
- Vasja, Sergei is right.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.513
- Shut the fuck up, you Jewboy!

24:50.547 --> 24:52.447
You're here
just to make pretty pictures.

24:52.482 --> 24:54.609
- Vasja, you're too smart
to be in charge.

24:54.651 --> 24:56.243
Let Seryosha have his fun.

24:56.285 --> 24:58.752
We can always slit his throat
later.

24:58.787 --> 25:01.084
- Alexei?

25:01.122 --> 25:03.249
Sacha?

25:03.290 --> 25:05.723
You want him to be in command?

25:05.759 --> 25:07.555
The fucking radio hand?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.583
He's not even Russian.

25:12.363 --> 25:16.161
Okay, have it your way.

25:16.198 --> 25:17.631
But don't come crying to me

25:17.667 --> 25:20.635
when he leads us
into some fritzie trap.

25:20.669 --> 25:21.930
Stop fucking filming!

25:21.970 --> 25:23.960
- Comrade, control your temper.

25:42.884 --> 25:45.716
- Make another sound,
I fucking shoot your balls off!

25:49.587 --> 25:52.077
- Alexei, where are you going?

26:04.498 --> 26:07.159
- Dima, be safer outside.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.729
Do not get in my way.

26:27.414 --> 26:29.381
- We might have found
some dinner.

26:29.415 --> 26:31.211
Mmm.

26:34.151 --> 26:36.483
Come here, little bunny.

26:36.520 --> 26:37.781
Come over here.

26:37.821 --> 26:40.381
Ah! Ah!

26:47.094 --> 26:49.027
- Guys, look!
There is someone here!

26:50.396 --> 26:51.453
- No, Alexei, no!

26:53.598 --> 26:55.259
Alexei!

26:55.299 --> 26:56.926
Alexei.

26:56.967 --> 26:58.934
We're supposed
to get a prisoner, remember,

26:58.968 --> 27:00.060
to interrogate,

27:00.103 --> 27:03.093
find out where our boys are,
yeah?

27:04.773 --> 27:07.400
<i>- Sie sind...
Sie sind meine Hasen.</i>

27:07.441 --> 27:09.067
- What's the crazy old tramp
saying, eh?

27:09.109 --> 27:11.633
- Something about
stealing his rabbits.

27:11.677 --> 27:12.974
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

27:13.011 --> 27:14.307
No, no, no.

27:14.345 --> 27:18.007
I'm liberating your rabbits
from fascist oppression.

27:19.949 --> 27:21.041
What is this place?

27:21.084 --> 27:22.846
- I don't understand.
- What is this?

27:22.885 --> 27:23.942
- Vasja, if you let me,

27:23.985 --> 27:27.078
I... I have experience
in this sort of...

27:27.121 --> 27:28.145
interviews.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.485
- Interviews, yeah?

27:30.523 --> 27:32.456
This, I want to see.

27:41.131 --> 27:44.428
- What is going on here, huh?

27:44.465 --> 27:46.296
Where has everybody gone?

27:48.535 --> 27:51.470
- Everybody's dead or run away.

27:51.505 --> 27:53.664
- What were they running from?

27:57.242 --> 28:00.210
- That's a weird camera.

28:00.244 --> 28:02.370
Ls that a microphone?

28:02.411 --> 28:04.571
Are you recording sound?

28:04.613 --> 28:07.103
I've never seen a camera
like this before.

28:11.117 --> 28:13.415
What were they running from?

28:13.453 --> 28:16.443
- I-I-I...

28:16.487 --> 28:18.455
From...

28:18.489 --> 28:19.956
From things...
- What things?

28:19.990 --> 28:21.457
- The doctor makes.

28:21.491 --> 28:24.118
- What things?

28:24.160 --> 28:25.557
Where is the doctor now?

28:25.592 --> 28:26.614
- Shut it!

28:26.658 --> 28:28.056
Who gives a fuck
about this doctor?

28:28.092 --> 28:30.318
We want to know
about Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

28:30.356 --> 28:31.686
Ivan, hold him.

28:31.723 --> 28:33.120
- Comrade, listen.

28:33.156 --> 28:35.620
There was obviously some sort
of secret project going on.

28:35.654 --> 28:37.585
- Oh, that's obvious, is it?

28:37.620 --> 28:38.928
- Tiger Bear
must have been sent here

28:38.952 --> 28:40.316
for that very reason.

28:40.353 --> 28:42.094
Vasja, if you find the doctor,
we'll probably find...

28:42.118 --> 28:43.674
- That's fucking fascinating,
comrade.

28:43.718 --> 28:45.342
Now get the fuck
behind the camera.

28:45.383 --> 28:47.178
We have wasted enough time.

28:49.847 --> 28:53.301
Where are the Russians?

28:53.347 --> 28:54.811
- Ah!
- Where?

28:54.846 --> 28:55.970
- I don't know!

28:58.511 --> 29:00.976
I just feed the animals.

29:01.010 --> 29:03.839
- Where...
- Ah!

29:03.876 --> 29:05.000
I'll...

29:05.041 --> 29:07.562
I'll take you there.

29:07.607 --> 29:09.004
- Oh, if you take me there,

29:09.039 --> 29:12.629
you will never have to worry
about getting hurt ever again.

29:12.670 --> 29:13.762
Come on.
Let's go.

29:19.602 --> 29:20.965
- Keep moving!

29:22.433 --> 29:23.898
- Vasja,
do you think this is wise?

29:23.932 --> 29:25.522
- Shut up.

29:25.565 --> 29:27.860
- What if there are more
like the ones in the church, eh?

29:27.898 --> 29:29.057
- Here.

29:37.160 --> 29:38.489
Ah.

29:40.459 --> 29:42.424
It's down there.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.083
- The Russian soldiers
are down there?

29:44.124 --> 29:45.282
- Yes.

29:51.088 --> 29:52.144
- Down there?

29:52.187 --> 29:53.209
- Yeah.

29:53.253 --> 29:55.219
You... you go.
You'll see.

29:55.253 --> 29:56.581
- It's not safe here, Vasja.

29:56.618 --> 29:57.981
Let us take him back
to Seryosha.

29:58.017 --> 30:00.209
- I'm in charge here,
so fucking do what I tell you.

30:00.250 --> 30:01.374
Show us.

30:01.416 --> 30:02.439
- No, no, I wouldn't...

30:02.483 --> 30:03.778
- No, you fucking show us!

30:03.815 --> 30:05.939
Come on.

30:05.981 --> 30:07.969
- Ah! Ah!

30:19.341 --> 30:20.829
- Vassili, keep an eye on him.

30:33.202 --> 30:35.497
How far is it?

30:35.534 --> 30:37.692
Ah, this way?

30:40.432 --> 30:42.226
You go fir...

30:42.264 --> 30:44.729
Fuck.

30:44.764 --> 30:47.058
Where has he gone?
Where has he gone?

30:47.096 --> 30:48.561
I told you, keep an eye on him!

30:48.595 --> 30:50.389
- Where the hell...

30:51.761 --> 30:53.555
- Now you go ahead.

30:56.259 --> 30:58.553
- Ivan, check that side.

30:58.591 --> 31:00.215
Alexei,

31:00.256 --> 31:02.551
over there.

31:02.589 --> 31:04.247
Where the hell is he?

31:31.609 --> 31:32.666
What?

31:32.709 --> 31:34.402
- What?

31:34.442 --> 31:36.600
- Shit.
What the...

31:38.540 --> 31:40.403
- Get out of the way!

31:49.702 --> 31:50.758
- Don't shoot!

31:50.801 --> 31:53.062
You're gonna shoot me,
you idiot!

31:53.100 --> 31:55.089
- Get out!
Get out!

31:57.231 --> 31:59.254
- Go, go, go, go, go!

31:59.297 --> 32:01.092
Shoot it!
Shoot!

32:01.130 --> 32:03.027
- Help!
Help!

32:03.063 --> 32:06.050
Alexei!
Fucking help!

32:06.094 --> 32:07.254
- Let's get out of here, now!

32:07.294 --> 32:08.656
Get out of here!

32:08.693 --> 32:10.455
- Which way?
Go, go, go, go!

32:16.323 --> 32:17.982
Ahh!

32:20.688 --> 32:21.881
- Agh!

32:24.254 --> 32:25.718
- Shoot it!

32:25.752 --> 32:27.718
Kill it!
Kill it!

32:27.751 --> 32:29.909
Get the hell out of here now!

32:33.449 --> 32:34.778
- One more!
One more!

32:34.816 --> 32:36.246
- Get out!

32:38.414 --> 32:39.614
- Okay, let's get out of here!

32:41.263 --> 32:42.668
- Over here.
This way!

32:42.705 --> 32:44.008
This way!
This direction!

32:44.045 --> 32:45.645
Here!

32:45.688 --> 32:46.688
- Oh!
There's one more!

32:46.727 --> 32:47.790
There's one more there!

32:47.833 --> 32:49.398
Go, go, go, go!
Out! Out!

32:53.464 --> 32:56.744
- Watch it!
There's more, more, more!

32:56.784 --> 32:58.921
- Guys, where are you?

32:58.962 --> 33:00.161
Close the door!
- Over here.

33:00.203 --> 33:01.574
- Close the door!

33:01.610 --> 33:03.084
- Ah!

33:03.119 --> 33:04.216
- Oh, no!

33:05.432 --> 33:08.507
- Shoot this motherfucker!

33:10.561 --> 33:11.532
Kill it!
Kill it!

33:11.566 --> 33:12.972
Shoot it!
Shoot it!

33:15.589 --> 33:17.291
- Shoot it!

33:17.332 --> 33:18.395
God!

33:25.109 --> 33:26.948
- Right now, get away!
Get away!

33:29.769 --> 33:31.871
- Run!
Run, run, run!

33:48.708 --> 33:50.514
Get it out.
- No.

33:50.553 --> 33:52.827
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

33:52.866 --> 33:54.842
- Please...

33:54.876 --> 33:57.356
- Don't fret, my friend.
I'm not giving up on you yet.

33:57.390 --> 33:58.921
- Leave him.
He's finished.

33:58.966 --> 34:00.235
We're getting out of here.

34:00.274 --> 34:01.302
- Get back to your post!

34:01.347 --> 34:02.946
You're supposed
to be keeping watch.

34:02.989 --> 34:04.189
- Fuck you!

34:04.229 --> 34:06.366
Those things,
they appear out of nowhere.

34:06.408 --> 34:08.887
They could be all around us,
and we wouldn't even know.

34:08.922 --> 34:10.020
Fuck out of the way.

34:10.062 --> 34:12.702
I'll finish him off.

34:12.743 --> 34:14.275
- Ugh!

34:14.320 --> 34:15.987
- Ah!
Oh...

34:16.029 --> 34:17.467
Fuck.

34:19.313 --> 34:20.947
- Vasja!

34:20.989 --> 34:23.766
- I'll fucking decide
when I'm finished

34:23.804 --> 34:26.011
and who finishes me off.

34:26.052 --> 34:28.862
Where's that freak?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.706
- Who?

34:30.745 --> 34:32.047
Dima?

34:35.739 --> 34:38.219
No, you idiot.

34:38.253 --> 34:40.664
That tramp...

34:40.701 --> 34:43.009
set us up...

34:43.047 --> 34:45.150
Trap!

34:45.193 --> 34:46.666
"I just feed the animals."

34:50.690 --> 34:53.135
- This is your fault.

34:53.170 --> 34:55.342
You were supposed to bring
a captive back here.

35:03.261 --> 35:05.741
- Sacha.

35:05.775 --> 35:08.220
All quiet here?

35:11.943 --> 35:14.114
- You're an educated man, Dima.

35:16.199 --> 35:19.583
What do you think
is going on here?

35:19.620 --> 35:21.255
- I am...

35:21.296 --> 35:23.707
not sure.

35:23.743 --> 35:26.885
I think we have stumbled upon
a new Nazi weapon.

35:29.273 --> 35:32.587
Only the Nazis would think
of something like this...

35:35.843 --> 35:39.456
Sewing dead people together

35:39.498 --> 35:43.315
and giving them knives
for hands.

35:43.353 --> 35:45.330
It's insane.

35:45.364 --> 35:48.140
- Or brilliant.

35:50.024 --> 35:51.520
No, Dima.

35:53.209 --> 35:54.705
It's insane.

36:07.154 --> 36:10.971
We'll move in the morning,

36:11.008 --> 36:15.191
and then we'll find
this Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

36:16.406 --> 36:18.108
- They're dead,

36:18.149 --> 36:19.177
and we will be too

36:19.221 --> 36:21.165
if we hang around here
any longer.

36:24.987 --> 36:26.187
- Sacha, go down!

36:26.227 --> 36:27.324
Sacha!

36:38.128 --> 36:39.499
- Go around!

36:39.535 --> 36:40.632
Sacha!

36:43.525 --> 36:45.160
- Hands up!
Hands in the air!

36:45.201 --> 36:46.263
Come on!

36:46.306 --> 36:47.370
Hold your fire!

36:47.413 --> 36:50.053
Hold your fire!

36:50.095 --> 36:51.124
- No, no!

36:51.167 --> 36:52.325
- Against the wall!

36:52.366 --> 36:53.989
Over there!

36:54.031 --> 36:55.552
- No, that is a girl!

36:55.596 --> 36:56.719
That's a girl!

36:56.761 --> 36:59.724
That's a girl!
- No, no, no, no!

36:59.758 --> 37:00.847
- Get over here!

37:00.889 --> 37:02.819
- Vasja!
- No, no, no, no!

37:02.854 --> 37:04.182
- Vasja!

37:06.017 --> 37:08.639
- Enough!
Enough!

37:08.680 --> 37:10.644
Where are the Russians?
- Please...

37:10.677 --> 37:11.869
- Where are the Russians?

37:11.910 --> 37:13.534
- You are Russians, no?

37:13.575 --> 37:16.366
- There where other Russians
here.

37:16.404 --> 37:17.460
Yesterday!

37:17.503 --> 37:18.966
- I... I don't know.

37:19.001 --> 37:21.294
We've been hiding.

37:21.331 --> 37:23.850
- Just the four of you?

37:23.895 --> 37:26.358
- Everyone else was killed
or ran.

37:26.393 --> 37:27.448
It was a massacre.

37:27.491 --> 37:29.115
- Who killed them?

37:29.156 --> 37:31.244
- The undead ones.

37:31.287 --> 37:34.613
Listen, the gunshots
and your firelight...

37:34.650 --> 37:36.307
We must hide
before they come looking.

37:36.348 --> 37:37.971
- Where do they come from?

37:38.012 --> 37:40.305
- Dima, leave this to me!

37:42.241 --> 37:43.898
How many were there?

37:43.938 --> 37:44.993
- We don't know.

37:45.037 --> 37:46.865
He keeps making more.

37:46.902 --> 37:48.525
We must hide now.
Please.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.164
- This is bullshit.
Let's just kill them.

37:50.165 --> 37:51.458
- No...
<i>Du darfst mich schiessen!</i>

37:51.496 --> 37:52.654
<i>- Nein, nein!
Bitte, bitte!</i>

37:52.695 --> 37:54.658
<i>Du darfst mich erschiessen
statt ihr.</i>

37:54.692 --> 37:56.213
- What did he say?

37:57.921 --> 37:59.886
Fritz says it's okay
if you shoot him.

37:59.919 --> 38:01.383
He'd rather be shot
by a real man

38:01.418 --> 38:04.710
than ripped apart
by those things out there.

38:04.748 --> 38:08.539
- Let's just kill them.
Keep the girl.

38:08.576 --> 38:10.199
Come here.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.864
- No, no, no, no.

38:11.905 --> 38:14.095
I am a trained nurse, ja?

38:14.136 --> 38:15.396
Look!
I can help your friend.

38:15.434 --> 38:17.330
- A trained nurse?

38:17.366 --> 38:18.592
- I can help your friend.

38:24.257 --> 38:26.516
I will help your comrade, ja?

38:29.584 --> 38:32.047
- Here.
Just breathe.

38:32.082 --> 38:35.203
Vanya, breathe.

38:35.244 --> 38:38.365
Well, can you get it off?

38:38.407 --> 38:39.871
- I don't know.

38:39.906 --> 38:41.529
- You get it off,

38:41.570 --> 38:43.761
and we'll let you live.

38:43.802 --> 38:45.923
Deal?

38:45.965 --> 38:48.985
- I...
I can try.

38:49.028 --> 38:50.185
- You heard him, bitch.

38:50.226 --> 38:51.248
Get on with it.

38:51.292 --> 38:53.255
- Okay, Vanya, what we'll do...

38:54.356 --> 38:56.285
- Breathe.

38:57.718 --> 39:00.011
- Slowly!
Slowly!

39:00.049 --> 39:01.411
Breathe!

39:02.779 --> 39:03.800
- Ivan...

39:07.340 --> 39:08.497
- Ivan, look at the nurse.

39:10.103 --> 39:11.760
- Don't move.

39:19.126 --> 39:22.486
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

39:22.522 --> 39:25.609
- Well,
that was fucking useless.

39:25.652 --> 39:27.173
- No, no!

39:27.217 --> 39:28.238
We must work together.

39:28.282 --> 39:29.871
We're all human.

39:29.913 --> 39:31.038
Please don't hurt me.

39:31.078 --> 39:33.008
Please!
No, no!

39:35.805 --> 39:36.828
- Vasja!

39:36.872 --> 39:37.872
- No! No!

39:37.904 --> 39:38.960
- Vasja!

39:39.002 --> 39:41.091
- Ah!
- Enough!

39:45.328 --> 39:46.328
- Alexei!

39:48.991 --> 39:52.078
- Shoot that thing, somebody!

39:52.121 --> 39:54.583
- Shoot it, Sacha!
Shoot it!

39:57.314 --> 39:58.642
Alexei, hold on!

40:08.501 --> 40:09.556
- Shoot it!

40:11.397 --> 40:13.951
Shoot it!

40:13.994 --> 40:16.045
Someone stop it!
Stop it!

40:16.087 --> 40:17.571
Sacha!
Sacha, follow me!

40:17.616 --> 40:20.073
Sacha!
- Dima, careful!

40:20.107 --> 40:21.828
Where is it?

40:27.948 --> 40:29.002
- Shoot!

40:35.423 --> 40:36.578
- Shit!

40:50.174 --> 40:51.174
Sacha!

40:51.204 --> 40:52.326
Sergei!

40:53.430 --> 40:55.219
- I'll get the camera!

40:55.257 --> 40:57.941
I got it.
I got it.

40:57.982 --> 41:00.235
I got the camera.

41:00.274 --> 41:02.325
Dima, I got the camera!

41:02.367 --> 41:03.522
- Ahh!

41:03.563 --> 41:05.715
- Grenade!
Get down!

41:12.401 --> 41:15.380
- Dima!
Dima!

41:20.873 --> 41:22.526
- Are you all right?

41:25.557 --> 41:27.347
- My eyes...
- Sacha.

41:27.384 --> 41:29.343
Sacha, give me the camera.

41:29.377 --> 41:30.771
- Take it.

41:30.806 --> 41:32.200
- Here!

41:32.234 --> 41:34.023
Down the hole!
Quickly!

41:36.620 --> 41:39.543
- Eva!
Eva!

41:39.578 --> 41:41.469
Eva!

41:41.504 --> 41:43.555
- No, no, this way.
- This way, Dima!

41:43.597 --> 41:45.023
Sacha!
Dima!

41:46.953 --> 41:48.380
- Come on, Vasja!

41:48.415 --> 41:49.841
Grenade!
- Hey!

42:14.295 --> 42:16.413
- Does anyone read me?
Over.

42:18.282 --> 42:20.139
We are trapped.
We can't hold out much longer.

42:20.176 --> 42:22.928
Our position
is 51-17-28 north

42:22.966 --> 42:26.250
by 13-22-04 east.

42:26.288 --> 42:28.111
Do you read me?
Over.

42:29.644 --> 42:31.762
- I don't fucking believe this.

42:31.804 --> 42:33.389
- Sergei.

42:33.432 --> 42:35.550
Comrade.

42:35.592 --> 42:36.712
Let me explain...

42:42.700 --> 42:44.320
- What's going on?

42:44.362 --> 42:47.648
- Why don't you ask
Comrade Dima?

42:47.684 --> 42:50.640
- What?

42:50.674 --> 42:52.328
- Tell them...

42:52.368 --> 42:53.988
before I blow
your fucking brains out.

42:54.029 --> 42:55.029
- You don't understand.

42:55.060 --> 42:56.543
- Tell them!

43:00.508 --> 43:03.465
- There's no Tiger Bear 3-0-3.

43:03.499 --> 43:04.959
- I don't get it.

43:04.993 --> 43:07.610
- Here.

43:07.651 --> 43:10.302
It's a radio-jammer.

43:10.341 --> 43:11.463
I couldn't understand

43:11.505 --> 43:12.943
why we were getting
no signal before.

43:12.967 --> 43:15.424
This is why.

43:15.459 --> 43:19.933
Our comrade here
was blocking us,

43:19.977 --> 43:21.767
cutting us off from Mother.

43:21.805 --> 43:24.919
- And I was carrying
the fucking thing!

43:24.960 --> 43:27.679
- He could use it
to transmit the message

43:27.718 --> 43:30.267
from his pack to the radio
and...

43:30.310 --> 43:31.601
- And lead us here.

43:31.638 --> 43:32.759
So there is no...

43:32.801 --> 43:33.888
- No Tiger Bear,

43:33.930 --> 43:36.219
no Russian soldiers
needing our help.

43:36.256 --> 43:39.178
- Fucking bastard!

43:39.213 --> 43:40.232
- Oof!

43:40.276 --> 43:41.432
Ah!

43:43.532 --> 43:44.654
- Wait, Vasja.

43:44.695 --> 43:46.484
Don't kill him yet.

43:46.523 --> 43:49.308
First I want to know why.

43:49.346 --> 43:52.733
- We are not going anywhere.

43:55.026 --> 43:56.680
Not going anywhere.

43:58.416 --> 44:00.328
- That fritz must know the way.
We'll follow him.

44:00.343 --> 44:03.299
- That fucking old fascist?

44:03.333 --> 44:04.953
- You don't understand.

44:06.755 --> 44:09.213
We are not leaving.

44:09.246 --> 44:10.299
That's an order.

44:10.342 --> 44:11.396
- An order?

44:11.440 --> 44:12.992
I'm going to cut his balls off...

44:13.034 --> 44:14.054
- Here, here, here, here.

44:14.097 --> 44:15.717
- Oof!

44:15.758 --> 44:17.378
- Read this document.

44:17.420 --> 44:20.240
I'm a full captain,
your superior officer.

44:22.469 --> 44:24.107
I have a list
of every man in this squad's

44:24.131 --> 44:25.920
family and loved ones.

44:25.958 --> 44:28.575
If something happens to me...

44:28.616 --> 44:29.907
- What?

44:29.944 --> 44:31.768
- You know what will happen
to them.

44:41.772 --> 44:42.791
- Right.

44:42.835 --> 44:44.160
- Dima...

44:46.689 --> 44:48.173
Tell me...

44:49.812 --> 44:52.951
Why didn't you just tell us?

44:52.993 --> 44:55.299
Huh?

44:55.338 --> 44:57.471
Why the trick?

44:57.512 --> 45:00.321
- This is a top secret mission.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.163
The bureau was afraid
there might be a leak.

45:02.201 --> 45:03.673
- So you let us come unprepared?

45:03.708 --> 45:05.841
- No, I did not know
the exact nature

45:05.884 --> 45:07.585
of the work
that the doctor was working on.

45:07.625 --> 45:10.433
- He's not a doctor.

45:10.471 --> 45:12.274
He's a madman.

45:12.312 --> 45:16.319
- My orders are to capture him,
if possible.

45:16.364 --> 45:17.461
If not, kill him.

45:17.503 --> 45:18.632
- Capture?

45:18.675 --> 45:20.170
What does
the glorious motherland...

45:20.215 --> 45:21.916
- Listen!
- Want with that madman?

45:21.956 --> 45:23.931
- Listen to me!

45:23.966 --> 45:25.437
This is none of your business.

45:25.472 --> 45:27.972
You do your job;
you go home safe and sound.

45:28.017 --> 45:29.146
Do you understand?

45:29.188 --> 45:30.594
- Is there even film
in that camera?

45:30.596 --> 45:31.897
- Yes, yes.
The film is real.

45:31.934 --> 45:33.098
I need a record of everything

45:33.106 --> 45:34.636
just in case
we cannot take him alive.

45:34.680 --> 45:37.156
Now, Fritz,

45:37.192 --> 45:38.595
we are going
to the doctor's base,

45:38.632 --> 45:40.971
and you...
You're taking us there.

45:41.008 --> 45:42.241
Which way?

46:11.713 --> 46:14.213
- This is the lift
up to the church.

46:18.276 --> 46:21.083
- If these things
are a Nazi weapon,

46:21.121 --> 46:23.598
they've turned on their master.

46:23.632 --> 46:26.133
Not so brilliant, huh, Dima?

46:29.660 --> 46:32.467
Ah, fuck.

46:32.506 --> 46:34.482
- Fritz,

46:34.516 --> 46:36.513
you used to work here, right?

46:36.557 --> 46:38.394
Where is the doctor?

46:38.434 --> 46:39.404
- Hey!

46:39.438 --> 46:42.075
Which way?

46:42.116 --> 46:44.285
<i>- Den Gleisen.</i>

46:44.326 --> 46:46.095
<i>Folgen.</i>

46:46.134 --> 46:47.835
- Dima,

46:47.875 --> 46:49.849
you can't be serious.

46:49.885 --> 46:52.190
You want to go to the base
of this thing?

46:52.228 --> 46:53.427
It's suicide.

46:53.467 --> 46:55.304
- I thought I made it clear.

46:55.342 --> 46:57.511
Our job is to find and capture
the doctor.

46:57.552 --> 46:58.818
- Or kill.

46:58.857 --> 47:00.295
Captured or killed, you said.

47:00.330 --> 47:02.329
- Yes, yes, yes.
Moscow wants him alive.

47:03.880 --> 47:04.942
- They're here!
- Go!

47:04.985 --> 47:06.012
Get out, Dima!

47:09.539 --> 47:11.376
Run, Dima!
For God's sakes!

47:15.466 --> 47:16.629
- Get in!

47:16.670 --> 47:18.507
Close the door!
Close the door!

47:24.774 --> 47:25.774
- Gun!

47:25.811 --> 47:26.811
- Get the fucking gun!

47:26.850 --> 47:27.850
- Go!
- Come on!

47:31.705 --> 47:33.737
Run faster!

47:33.781 --> 47:35.584
- Get in.

47:35.622 --> 47:37.757
- Close the door!

47:41.650 --> 47:43.088
- Come on, let's go!

47:43.123 --> 47:45.121
Forget the gun!
Get inside!

47:50.758 --> 47:53.257
- Lock it in, you fucking idiot!

47:59.664 --> 48:02.643
- What the fuck?

48:02.677 --> 48:03.807
- No, leave it!

48:03.849 --> 48:04.979
It can't hurt us.

48:10.412 --> 48:12.444
- This one can't hurt us.

48:21.494 --> 48:23.903
At last,
we're getting somewhere.

48:47.043 --> 48:48.607
<i>- Nein! Nein!</i>

48:48.650 --> 48:50.521
- Little fascist...

49:35.058 --> 49:36.861
- Sacha, go down there
and take a look.

49:36.901 --> 49:38.875
- What?
You crazy?

49:38.909 --> 49:40.712
- I've got a better idea.

49:40.750 --> 49:42.749
Vasja, get the boy.

49:42.793 --> 49:44.494
- Right.
In you go.

49:44.534 --> 49:45.732
<i>- Nein!</i>

49:45.773 --> 49:49.244
<i>- "Nein!
Nein!"</i>

49:49.290 --> 49:50.419
Come on.

49:52.872 --> 49:54.139
- Wait!

49:54.178 --> 49:55.810
First we'll take you down,

49:55.852 --> 49:58.019
then we'll bring you back.

49:58.062 --> 49:59.625
- In you go.

49:59.668 --> 50:02.443
<i>- Nein! Nein!</i>

50:05.160 --> 50:07.466
- I've got you!

50:07.504 --> 50:10.127
- Hans, tell me what you see!

50:13.698 --> 50:15.094
- Pull!

50:15.130 --> 50:16.130
Pull!

50:19.860 --> 50:21.052
Pull him up.

50:21.093 --> 50:22.114
- Ugh!

50:37.310 --> 50:38.333
- Shoot it!

50:38.377 --> 50:40.499
Just do something!
God damn it!

50:40.541 --> 50:42.006
- Sacha, the wire!

50:42.039 --> 50:43.368
Try and cut the wire!
Get back!

50:44.504 --> 50:46.899
Cut the fucking wire!

50:46.935 --> 50:47.992
The wire!

50:50.533 --> 50:51.724
Cut it, Sacha!

50:56.493 --> 50:58.549
- Down!
- Get down!

51:12.746 --> 51:15.301
- You all right, Captain?

51:24.535 --> 51:26.363
Thanks, Seryosha.

51:37.624 --> 51:40.746
- Okay, let us go down there.

51:40.787 --> 51:42.047
We can fix a rope.

51:42.086 --> 51:43.778
I told you,
the doctor's lab is down there.

51:43.818 --> 51:44.840
- Of course, Dima.

51:44.884 --> 51:45.884
After you!

51:48.448 --> 51:49.912
- Ahh...

51:53.676 --> 51:55.641
- So, Dima,

51:55.675 --> 51:58.502
you want to continue
your secret mission?

51:58.538 --> 52:00.832
You do it alone.

52:00.870 --> 52:04.196
I'm taking my men
out of this mad hole.

52:04.233 --> 52:07.322
- Bye-bye, Jewboy.

52:07.365 --> 52:10.193
Oh, sorry, I mean,
Captain Jewboy.

52:18.388 --> 52:21.045
- Don't forget
your precious film.

52:25.581 --> 52:27.205
- Traitors.

52:27.247 --> 52:29.404
Fucking traitors.

52:31.176 --> 52:32.800
All of them.

52:39.536 --> 52:41.364
Comrades!

52:42.700 --> 52:44.357
Come back!

52:45.996 --> 52:48.892
I order you, come back!

53:01.382 --> 53:04.505
Screw you, Czarevitch Stalin.

53:04.546 --> 53:07.375
Screw you, party slaves!

53:09.143 --> 53:12.130
Soul of the proletariat, my ass.

53:14.072 --> 53:16.864
You will all be shot anyway!

53:16.902 --> 53:19.866
You'll all be shot anyway!

53:24.862 --> 53:27.485
Fucking retard.

53:27.526 --> 53:29.990
Oh, God...

53:30.025 --> 53:32.147
I'm going to hell.

53:37.784 --> 53:39.543
- I am in hell.

55:04.208 --> 55:06.671
Mama, Papa,

55:06.705 --> 55:09.827
this is my last roll of film.

55:09.869 --> 55:11.834
Do not trust what they tell you.

55:11.868 --> 55:13.764
I made a deal
with the government.

55:13.799 --> 55:15.959
They promised to let you go
in exchange for the doctor.

55:19.128 --> 55:21.489
I don't think
that's happening anymore.

55:27.087 --> 55:28.643
I'm sorry.

55:28.685 --> 55:30.082
I love you,

55:30.118 --> 55:31.210
and I'm gonna miss you.

55:34.155 --> 55:35.418
Oh, fuck.

57:57.133 --> 57:59.124
- Oh, God...

58:52.390 --> 58:54.051
<i>Nein. Nein.</i>

58:55.426 --> 58:57.291
<i>Bleibt hier.</i>

58:58.996 --> 59:00.657
<i>Du musst mich toten.</i>

59:02.967 --> 59:04.298
<i>Ich bin schon.</i>

59:06.637 --> 59:09.435
<i>Ich bitte dich.</i>

59:09.473 --> 59:13.000
<i>Du bist Arsch.</i>

59:27.525 --> 59:29.790
<i>Wirklich!</i>

59:29.828 --> 59:32.352
<i>Ich bitte dich!</i>

59:32.396 --> 59:33.864
<i>Nein!</i>

59:33.899 --> 59:36.059
<i>Nein, nein, nein!</i>

59:36.100 --> 59:38.092
<i>Ich bitte dich!</i>

59:41.239 --> 59:42.900
<i>Nein.</i>

59:42.941 --> 59:45.841
<i>Ich bitte dich.</i>

59:45.876 --> 59:48.310
<i>Nein!</i>

59:50.115 --> 59:51.810
Nein!

59:53.851 --> 59:55.820
Ahh!

59:55.854 --> 59:57.788
<i>Nein!</i>

59:57.823 --> 01:00:00.518
<i>Ich bitte dich!</i>

01:00:00.558 --> 01:00:02.356
<i>Nein!</i>

01:00:04.696 --> 01:00:06.027
<i>Nein!</i>

01:00:09.134 --> 01:00:11.432
<i>Ich bitte dich.</i>

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:12.562
- Okay...

01:01:25.211 --> 01:01:27.111
- Oh, God...

01:01:37.023 --> 01:01:39.184
- Okay.
Okay.

01:01:52.972 --> 01:01:54.769
- Ivan...

01:01:54.807 --> 01:01:57.867
Ivan, it's me, Dimitri.
Ivan.

01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:59.208
Whoa!
Hey!

01:01:59.245 --> 01:02:00.838
Ivan! Ivan!
What...

01:02:14.327 --> 01:02:16.455
- Okay, give us something good.

01:02:22.669 --> 01:02:23.966
No, no, not my finger.

01:02:24.003 --> 01:02:25.198
Not my finger.

01:02:43.156 --> 01:02:44.487
Is it filming?

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:47.889
Yeah?

01:02:47.928 --> 01:02:49.327
Good.

01:03:17.157 --> 01:03:18.887
Here.

01:03:18.927 --> 01:03:20.484
It's good.

01:03:24.565 --> 01:03:26.055
Eat this.

01:03:28.336 --> 01:03:30.166
It will make you strong.

01:03:31.339 --> 01:03:34.706
It's <i>Eintopf.</i>

01:03:34.742 --> 01:03:36.403
- I'm not hungry.

01:03:38.378 --> 01:03:39.505
- Eat.

01:03:56.164 --> 01:03:58.962
- I need you to be strong.

01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:04.331
- Do you like it?

01:04:04.372 --> 01:04:05.600
It's really good.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.108
I have added some
of my own ingredients in it.

01:04:13.014 --> 01:04:15.642
- I need you to be strong

01:04:15.683 --> 01:04:18.015
to make a record
of my work here.

01:04:19.954 --> 01:04:21.081
- Your work?

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.953
- For posterity, you know?

01:04:27.596 --> 01:04:31.224
You're Dr. Frankenstein?

01:04:31.265 --> 01:04:33.563
- Do you think you can do this?

01:04:33.601 --> 01:04:36.365
Do you think you can do this
for me?

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.868
- Swallow.

01:04:40.909 --> 01:04:43.036
Swallow.

01:04:43.078 --> 01:04:44.339
Swallow!

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:59.025
- Are you filming?
- Yes.

01:04:59.059 --> 01:05:01.651
- Okay.
Come in.

01:05:01.694 --> 01:05:03.717
Go, go, go, follow.

01:05:03.761 --> 01:05:05.227
Come.

01:05:05.261 --> 01:05:06.920
Oh, don't be shy.
Come.

01:05:08.927 --> 01:05:11.895
My father said
man would be more efficient

01:05:11.929 --> 01:05:15.384
if they have hammers
and screwdrivers

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:17.555
instead of fingers.

01:05:17.597 --> 01:05:20.393
Here, use this.

01:05:20.432 --> 01:05:22.727
When I tried to do it with cats,

01:05:22.765 --> 01:05:27.063
he told me
it was a sin against God.

01:05:27.099 --> 01:05:29.532
He... he beat me.

01:05:29.567 --> 01:05:30.691
It's not a sin.

01:05:30.733 --> 01:05:34.188
It's simple mechanics,
engineering.

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:36.326
Ugh!

01:05:36.368 --> 01:05:38.562
Well...

01:05:38.603 --> 01:05:40.569
After Father died,

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:43.763
the Nazis closed the factory
and sent me to a camp.

01:05:46.038 --> 01:05:49.493
Someone told the <i>Sturmbannführer</i>
about my cats.

01:05:49.538 --> 01:05:52.267
He asked me
if I could do the same

01:05:52.306 --> 01:05:53.794
with people.

01:05:55.740 --> 01:06:00.696
So I used Grandfather's notes.

01:06:00.741 --> 01:06:03.173
His techniques were quite crude.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:07.004
He needed thunderstorms,

01:06:07.043 --> 01:06:10.374
but now I can do it
with a generator!

01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:13.577
- That's fascinating, Viktor.

01:06:13.611 --> 01:06:15.577
Can you explain
how your automatons

01:06:15.611 --> 01:06:18.077
receive and follow orders and...

01:06:18.111 --> 01:06:19.737
- What did you say?

01:06:19.779 --> 01:06:22.076
They are not machines
or puppets...

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.601
- Sorry, sorry.
I-I-I...

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.113
- Like the toys my father built!

01:06:27.947 --> 01:06:30.914
Each one is still alive.

01:06:30.948 --> 01:06:33.540
- I see.
- They even need to eat.

01:06:33.582 --> 01:06:35.411
Go, hurry up.

01:06:36.816 --> 01:06:38.442
I feed them

01:06:38.483 --> 01:06:41.779
with the same <i>Eintopf</i>
I gave you.

01:06:41.817 --> 01:06:43.477
- Yes.

01:06:43.518 --> 01:06:45.109
- Ah, fuck you!

01:06:45.152 --> 01:06:46.176
Fuck you!

01:06:46.219 --> 01:06:47.445
- Here they are.

01:06:49.653 --> 01:06:52.051
- At least one is still alive.

01:06:52.087 --> 01:06:53.713
- Fuck you!
Fuck you!

01:06:53.754 --> 01:06:55.131
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you all.

01:06:55.155 --> 01:06:56.397
- Don't do this to me.
- Fuck you!

01:06:56.421 --> 01:06:57.547
Fuck you!

01:06:57.588 --> 01:06:58.611
- Fuck you!

01:06:58.655 --> 01:07:00.281
Fuck you.

01:07:00.322 --> 01:07:01.288
Son of a...

01:07:01.322 --> 01:07:03.788
- God...

01:07:03.823 --> 01:07:04.949
- He'll be fine.

01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:07.321
I'll take care of him.

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:08.653
Come, come, come.

01:07:16.626 --> 01:07:18.217
- Incredible.

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:19.488
- Come!

01:07:19.528 --> 01:07:21.323
I want to show you something.

01:07:23.361 --> 01:07:24.419
Come in!

01:07:24.462 --> 01:07:26.156
- Yes, yes.
I'm coming.

01:07:28.929 --> 01:07:30.395
- Come here.

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:32.760
I want to show you something.

01:07:38.498 --> 01:07:40.124
This is the generator.

01:07:40.166 --> 01:07:41.223
- I see.

01:07:41.266 --> 01:07:42.425
- Look.

01:07:46.866 --> 01:07:48.356
- It works.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.264
It works!

01:07:50.301 --> 01:07:51.325
- Genius.

01:07:51.369 --> 01:07:52.459
This is genius!

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:54.263
- Come with me.
Come.

01:07:54.302 --> 01:07:55.961
I'll show you something else.

01:07:57.336 --> 01:07:58.802
- Doctor...

01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:00.962
- What?
- Listen.

01:08:02.104 --> 01:08:04.333
Listen!

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:06.998
Can't you hear it?

01:08:07.038 --> 01:08:08.334
- What was that?

01:08:08.372 --> 01:08:10.839
- It's us, the Red Army,

01:08:10.873 --> 01:08:12.168
our artillery.

01:08:12.206 --> 01:08:16.196
- How far away
would you say they are?

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.366
- 15 kilometers?

01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:20.374
They could be here
in a matter of hours.

01:08:20.408 --> 01:08:22.203
- You're telling me this
because...

01:08:22.241 --> 01:08:24.265
- I am here to offer you a deal.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:27.606
Our military leadership
is very interested in your work.

01:08:27.644 --> 01:08:29.611
- Of course.

01:08:29.645 --> 01:08:32.611
I'll give you my weapon
to use against Western Allies

01:08:32.645 --> 01:08:35.941
to turn the whole world
into a socialist utopia, right?

01:08:35.978 --> 01:08:38.639
- Yes, I think we understand
each other very well.

01:08:40.747 --> 01:08:42.714
- And if I refuse?

01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:46.374
- We'll bomb you and your army
back to the Stone Age.

01:08:52.683 --> 01:08:54.149
Very nice.

01:08:54.184 --> 01:08:56.343
How fucking cozy.

01:09:03.486 --> 01:09:05.452
- In experiments,

01:09:05.487 --> 01:09:07.975
the fresher the specimens,
the better.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:12.979
And if I can use flesh
that is still alive,

01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.145
I can perform miracles.

01:09:15.188 --> 01:09:17.346
- Still alive?

01:09:18.854 --> 01:09:22.652
- Tell me, which of these two

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:24.314
is a better Communist?

01:09:24.356 --> 01:09:25.685
- Wha... what?

01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:31.145
- Which of these two
is a better Communist?

01:09:31.191 --> 01:09:32.520
- This one
is a better Communist.

01:09:32.558 --> 01:09:34.750
Don't!
No!

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:35.848
I...

01:09:39.225 --> 01:09:40.316
- Hans!

01:09:45.059 --> 01:09:46.718
Ready?
- Yes.

01:09:49.993 --> 01:09:52.220
- So,<i> Sturmbannführer</i>,

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:53.417
we meet again.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.757
- Viktor, <i>bitte.</i>

01:09:54.794 --> 01:09:55.918
<i>Es tut mir leid dass</i>

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.426
<i>wir versucht haben lhr
aufzuhalten.</i>

01:09:57.461 --> 01:09:58.587
- Hush now, Dieter.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.594
You don't have to apologize.

01:10:00.627 --> 01:10:02.253
I'm going to make it all okay.

01:10:02.295 --> 01:10:03.556
- Doctor, there's no time.

01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:04.822
The Red Army is almost here.

01:10:04.862 --> 01:10:06.404
If you want to work for me,
you need to tell me now.

01:10:06.428 --> 01:10:07.826
- Enough!

01:10:07.862 --> 01:10:09.159
I said I would think about it.

01:10:09.197 --> 01:10:11.663
Now focus.

01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:13.526
<i>- Nein.</i>

01:10:14.663 --> 01:10:16.289
Viktor.

01:10:16.330 --> 01:10:19.695
<i>Nein. Nein.</i>

01:10:39.067 --> 01:10:41.192
- Dima...

01:10:43.468 --> 01:10:45.094
- Hey.

01:10:45.135 --> 01:10:46.896
Hey.

01:10:46.935 --> 01:10:47.958
I told you to film.

01:10:48.001 --> 01:10:49.059
- Sorry.

01:11:01.604 --> 01:11:02.900
- What are you doing?

01:11:02.938 --> 01:11:04.529
- Don't you see?

01:11:06.738 --> 01:11:08.705
I can...
I can end the war

01:11:08.739 --> 01:11:10.671
by creating a new being

01:11:10.705 --> 01:11:13.501
that brings them together.

01:11:13.539 --> 01:11:16.994
- Are you serious?

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.006
- I can make them stop.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:23.006
I can make them understand
each other.

01:11:33.209 --> 01:11:35.198
I'll be right back.

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:40.671
- Dima...

01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:42.198
Help me.

01:11:42.243 --> 01:11:43.334
Help me...

01:11:43.376 --> 01:11:46.774
Help me, please.

01:11:46.810 --> 01:11:48.106
Please...

01:11:48.144 --> 01:11:49.939
- I can't, Seryosha.

01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:53.411
I have to bring him back
no matter what.

01:11:53.445 --> 01:11:54.808
- Dima...

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:58.308
Don't you understand?

01:11:58.346 --> 01:11:59.971
He's crazy.

01:12:00.012 --> 01:12:01.944
Dima, he's insane.

01:12:01.979 --> 01:12:05.207
- I told you...
I told you, I can't.

01:12:05.246 --> 01:12:07.712
I promise you this, Seryosha,
when I return to Moscow,

01:12:07.747 --> 01:12:09.338
I will personally ensure
you're awarded

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:11.107
the Hero of the Soviet Union
medal.

01:12:12.414 --> 01:12:14.040
- Your sacrifice
will not be forgotten.

01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:15.104
- Dima!

01:12:15.148 --> 01:12:17.410
I swear, I'll kill you.

01:12:17.448 --> 01:12:19.812
I swear, I'll kill you!

01:12:40.719 --> 01:12:42.707
Dima!

01:12:50.353 --> 01:12:51.785
- As you can see,

01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:55.014
the two halves of the brain
have been grafted together.

01:12:55.054 --> 01:12:57.919
On the left side,
the Communist's.

01:12:57.955 --> 01:12:59.386
Hold on.

01:12:59.421 --> 01:13:00.546
Yeah...

01:13:00.588 --> 01:13:03.248
On the right side, the Nazi's.

01:13:05.489 --> 01:13:06.512
Yeah.

01:13:06.555 --> 01:13:07.953
That will be...

01:13:07.989 --> 01:13:09.285
That's too much here.

01:13:09.323 --> 01:13:11.915
Okay.

01:13:11.957 --> 01:13:12.957
I think...

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:14.580
Oh, shit.

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.852
Shit, come on.

01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:19.221
Okay, that's fine.

01:13:31.925 --> 01:13:33.585
Let me fix that.

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.656
The patient
is no longer breathing.

01:13:41.694 --> 01:13:42.853
Now...

01:13:44.027 --> 01:13:45.856
For the final step.

01:14:01.964 --> 01:14:03.123
<i>Drei!</i>

01:14:03.164 --> 01:14:04.629
<i>Zwei!</i>

01:14:04.664 --> 01:14:06.254
<i>Eins!</i>

01:14:06.298 --> 01:14:07.355
<i>Jetzt!</i>

01:14:18.366 --> 01:14:19.457
- It's obviously suffering

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.955
from a little
readjustment problem!

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.468
I can build more!

01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:26.369
- Ahh!

01:14:33.717 --> 01:14:35.653
- What are you doing?

01:14:35.687 --> 01:14:37.678
What are you doing?

01:14:44.835 --> 01:14:47.304
- How does that work?

01:14:47.338 --> 01:14:48.966
I need a different lens.

01:14:49.008 --> 01:14:51.274
How do you operate this camera?

01:14:53.147 --> 01:14:55.777
- Doctor, we had a deal.

01:14:55.819 --> 01:14:58.949
Listen, we had a deal, eh?

01:14:58.990 --> 01:15:00.288
You will be safe in Russia.

01:15:00.326 --> 01:15:02.453
- What deal?

01:15:02.495 --> 01:15:04.465
- I have...
I have people there.

01:15:04.499 --> 01:15:05.523
Orders...

01:15:05.567 --> 01:15:08.094
Enemies of the state, eh?

01:15:08.138 --> 01:15:10.107
You will be safe.

01:15:10.141 --> 01:15:11.905
What about our deal?

01:15:11.944 --> 01:15:13.585
- I am afraid
I am going to have to refuse

01:15:13.613 --> 01:15:14.911
your generous offer.

01:15:14.949 --> 01:15:16.747
- You are signing
your own death warrant.

01:15:16.785 --> 01:15:18.430
If we don't kill you,
your own people will.

01:15:18.454 --> 01:15:19.454
You understand that?

01:15:19.488 --> 01:15:20.512
- Oh, yes, I know.

01:15:20.557 --> 01:15:22.719
I was in a prison camp,
remember?

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.195
But I have other plans.

01:15:25.231 --> 01:15:26.642
- No, no, no!
Don't... don't leave me!

01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:28.134
Don't go!
Ah!

01:15:28.169 --> 01:15:30.297
- I'll be leaving momentarily.

01:15:30.339 --> 01:15:34.005
But there should be time
for one last experiment.

01:15:36.884 --> 01:15:38.511
- No, you can't.
You can't.

01:15:38.553 --> 01:15:40.351
- I can.
I can.

01:15:40.388 --> 01:15:42.016
Come here.
Come here.

01:15:42.057 --> 01:15:45.027
Now, what shall we do with you?

01:15:45.062 --> 01:15:46.529
Maybe...

01:15:46.564 --> 01:15:50.196
Maybe I will build this camera
into your skull.

01:15:50.237 --> 01:15:51.499
That might be fun.

01:15:56.581 --> 01:15:58.413
- You fool.

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:07.925
- A man... a man of vision
is always misunderstood.

01:16:10.068 --> 01:16:13.871
But the film in your camera

01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:16.537
will convince the doubters.

01:16:16.578 --> 01:16:19.013
- You're insane!

01:16:19.049 --> 01:16:20.677
You're not a doctor!

01:16:20.718 --> 01:16:22.346
You're sick!
- Oh, yes.

01:16:22.387 --> 01:16:23.582
- You hear me?
You're sick!

01:16:23.623 --> 01:16:25.148
- Oh, yes, I'm sick.

01:16:25.192 --> 01:16:26.922
Everybody's sick!

01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:30.297
The Nazis.
Communists.

01:16:30.334 --> 01:16:32.269
Capitalists.
Everyone!

01:16:32.303 --> 01:16:34.602
The sickness cannot be cured,

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.131
so it must be cut out,

01:16:36.176 --> 01:16:37.804
and my creations will do that.

01:16:37.845 --> 01:16:39.872
- Your creations
are fucking insanity!

01:16:39.916 --> 01:16:43.785
Look at them.
They're fucking cripples!

01:16:43.821 --> 01:16:45.119
- Okay.

01:16:45.156 --> 01:16:46.647
My father...

01:16:49.163 --> 01:16:51.462
Tried to have me locked up.

01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.766
He said
I was emotionally crippled.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:01.671
- I had no choice.

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:07.488
I injected him with a drug
that paralyzed him,

01:17:07.526 --> 01:17:09.756
but his eyes could still move,

01:17:09.795 --> 01:17:11.093
so he could watch as I...

01:17:11.131 --> 01:17:12.131
- No, no, no!
No, no, no!

01:17:15.671 --> 01:17:17.640
- What was that?

01:17:17.674 --> 01:17:20.551
- That is the beginning
of the carpet bombardment...

01:17:20.588 --> 01:17:23.464
- I will not have time for you
after all!

01:17:27.486 --> 01:17:30.728
That is...
That is my comrades

01:17:30.767 --> 01:17:34.547
coming to wipe you
off the face of this planet!

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:43.853
The deal, the deal I offered,

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:45.023
I will make it better.

01:17:45.064 --> 01:17:46.834
Anything! Anything!
Tell me what you need.

01:17:46.873 --> 01:17:48.506
I'll guarantee it!
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:17:48.548 --> 01:17:50.523
I am afraid after I go,

01:17:50.557 --> 01:17:52.760
my soldiers
may become a bit crazy.

01:17:55.645 --> 01:17:58.283
- What... what are you
talking about?

01:17:58.326 --> 01:18:00.459
- They obey only me,

01:18:00.501 --> 01:18:02.133
and I cannot take them with me,

01:18:02.175 --> 01:18:04.813
so after I go,

01:18:04.855 --> 01:18:07.092
they will turn out
against each other

01:18:07.131 --> 01:18:09.769
and anything else
they find nearby.

01:18:13.828 --> 01:18:15.631
- I would love to tell you more,

01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:18.478
but I have got...
I've got to go.

01:18:18.516 --> 01:18:20.788
So good luck, comrade.

01:18:22.567 --> 01:18:24.440
The film...

01:18:26.016 --> 01:18:30.493
Proof for the doubters
to make them believe.

01:18:30.537 --> 01:18:31.666
- Gah!

01:18:36.062 --> 01:18:38.196
- But it won't reveal
my real secrets.

01:18:38.238 --> 01:18:40.842
Do you know why?

01:18:40.884 --> 01:18:42.220
Look at me.
Do you know why?

01:18:42.257 --> 01:18:46.036
Because they are all locked up
in here.

01:18:46.073 --> 01:18:48.847
So I'm going to take your camera
with me.

01:18:52.871 --> 01:18:53.968
Ugh...

01:19:00.673 --> 01:19:02.739
- No!

01:19:02.782 --> 01:19:04.380
Sacha!

01:19:04.423 --> 01:19:07.095
You fucking idiot!

01:19:07.136 --> 01:19:08.973
Idiot!

01:19:11.656 --> 01:19:13.289
Well, don't just stand there!

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:15.739
Let me loose, you fuck!

01:19:22.504 --> 01:19:24.137
- Sacha.
Sacha.

01:19:24.179 --> 01:19:25.949
Sacha.

01:19:25.988 --> 01:19:27.323
Sacha!

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.890
Sacha!
Sacha, no, no, no, no.

01:19:28.934 --> 01:19:30.270
Sacha, come on.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:31.437
Sacha!
Sacha!

01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:32.917
Sacha, no, don't leave me!

01:19:32.952 --> 01:19:35.830
Please, please, please, please!
Sacha!

01:19:37.104 --> 01:19:38.234
Don't leave me.

01:19:40.152 --> 01:19:42.526
Sacha!

01:19:47.150 --> 01:19:48.280
- Sacha.

01:19:51.670 --> 01:19:53.303
- Sacha, thank God.
Sacha, thank you.

01:19:53.344 --> 01:19:54.508
Sacha, listen!

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:56.251
I was only trying to help
my mother!

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.592
- No, I cannot.
I'm sorry.

01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:59.331
I promised to bring them
this camera, Dima.

01:20:00.444 --> 01:20:03.115
- I will make sure that you get

01:20:03.156 --> 01:20:04.789
the Hero of the Soviet Union
medal.

01:20:04.830 --> 01:20:06.965
- Don't just stand there!

01:20:07.007 --> 01:20:08.007
Please!

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.566
- Help!
Help me!

01:20:14.607 --> 01:20:16.137
Sacha, do something!

01:20:17.621 --> 01:20:19.961
- No!

01:20:22.007 --> 01:20:23.172
- Ahh!
