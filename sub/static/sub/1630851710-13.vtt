<i>Previously</i> <i>
on "Vanderpump Rules"...</i>

00:03.699 --> 00:05.266
I think you should have
your logo on the front of these.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.572
Brock has created a company,

00:07.616 --> 00:10.314
which is a live streaming
fitness platform.

00:10.358 --> 00:11.663
Are you down to do a shoot?

00:11.707 --> 00:14.318
For free? [bleep], no!

00:14.362 --> 00:16.407
Do I need to explain it
anymore?!

00:16.451 --> 00:18.670
We're gonna open
a sandwich shop together.

00:18.714 --> 00:22.674
I always say, "Don't get mad.
Get even and then some."

00:22.718 --> 00:24.328
Oh, my God!

00:24.372 --> 00:27.592
What do you think about
throwing an engagement party?

00:27.636 --> 00:28.941
I love that.

00:28.985 --> 00:31.031
I wanna do it somewhere, like,
outside of L.A.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.380
A destination.

00:32.423 --> 00:35.296
Oh, my God! It's beautiful!

00:35.339 --> 00:37.037
- Yeah!

00:37.080 --> 00:38.299
I'm dying.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.518
I'm, like, so overwhelmed.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.693
I'm proud of you.

00:41.737 --> 00:44.653
Don't cry.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.699
All I'm saying is listen
to my ----ing husband's ideas!

00:47.743 --> 00:50.702
I do! Sometimes way the
more than you do!

00:50.746 --> 00:55.098
I think that it's best
that we try to keep

00:55.142 --> 00:57.100
the hangouts
that aren't work-related

00:57.144 --> 01:00.538
to, like,
a ----ing bare minimum.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.399
Hi, boo.

01:35.443 --> 01:37.314
It's so hot outside.

01:37.358 --> 01:40.404
-♪ We're making dinner
- Yeah.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.363
When you walk in and I'm
pumping my titties, are you--

01:42.406 --> 01:43.755
I don't even think about it.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.193
This thing can suck
your tits off.

01:46.236 --> 01:48.847
- That machine is working.

01:48.891 --> 01:50.066
Does it hurt?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.067
- Feels kinda good.
- Really?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.460
Kinda.

01:52.503 --> 01:55.593
They always say if you're
planning on breastfeeding,

01:55.637 --> 01:57.421
like, twist your nipples
and stuff.

01:57.465 --> 01:59.771
- Rough 'em up a bit.
- Rough 'em up.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.991
But I did a lot of nipple play
during, like, sexy time,

02:02.034 --> 02:04.341
so mine were ready to go.

02:04.385 --> 02:08.171
Pre-Ocean sex was at least
a couple times a week.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.173
Blowies were happening
really often,

02:10.217 --> 02:11.653
but becoming a mom,

02:11.696 --> 02:13.916
you just don't want that
in your mouth anymore.

02:13.959 --> 02:16.440
Okay, I'm a little...
♪ hungover

02:16.484 --> 02:18.616
- From the cocktails last night?
- Mm-hmm.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.444
I feel like I talked to you,
like, one time.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.794
Well, at least you said
something to me.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.405
What do you mean?

02:24.448 --> 02:25.797
Ariana didn't say one word
to me.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.190
Really?

02:27.234 --> 02:30.846
Lala! Lala! Lala! Lala!

02:32.108 --> 02:33.936
- Not a "hi"?
- Not a "hi."

02:33.979 --> 02:35.329
Did you see her at all?

02:35.372 --> 02:37.635
Yes, but I don't even know why
I'm shocked because

02:37.679 --> 02:41.987
she really doesn't acknowledge
anything in my world at all.

02:42.031 --> 02:45.121
I really don't wanna be
in the middle of this anymore.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.818
Ariana's important to me,

02:46.862 --> 02:49.212
and Lala's one of
my closest best friends.

02:49.256 --> 02:50.648
But I think it's easier
for them to say

02:50.692 --> 02:52.172
that they just don't give
a about each other

02:52.215 --> 02:56.045
than to admit that they're
really hurt by one another.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.960
So you know, Schwartz and I have
talked, like, about doing

02:58.003 --> 03:00.223
a sandwich shop
and the whole thing...

03:00.267 --> 03:01.659
- Yeah.
-...eventually.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.183
But, like, dude, I don't know.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.967
This bar's gonna keep him
a little tied up for a while.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.708
So the other day, like,
Ariana's like,

03:06.751 --> 03:08.971
"I'll ----ing do it with you,"
and I was like, "Will you?"

03:09.014 --> 03:11.452
Because I can't--
I can't do this by myself.

03:11.495 --> 03:14.585
- It's brilliant.
- I know.

03:14.629 --> 03:19.199
I got into business
with my best friends before.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.157
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.376
Cheers!

03:25.292 --> 03:27.816
And that ended terribly.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.818
I talked to Lisa about,
you know, about it,

03:29.861 --> 03:32.777
and she just was like,
"Come over to my house,

03:32.821 --> 03:33.909
and I'm gonna, like,

03:33.952 --> 03:36.041
kind of give you
some advice, some tips."

03:36.085 --> 03:37.695
- I don't know.
- Right.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.480
I didn't exactly go
to business school.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.743
When things do go south,

03:41.786 --> 03:43.832
your friendship goes south,
and your business goes south.

03:43.875 --> 03:45.921
But, like, with Ariana,
we don't have to worry

03:45.964 --> 03:49.577
about where one ends
and one begins.

03:49.620 --> 03:51.187
Remember when we were
in Palm Springs?

03:51.231 --> 03:54.451
And Randall was making
his last final pitch to the boys

03:54.495 --> 03:55.974
about wanting to invest?
And I was like,

03:56.018 --> 03:57.149
"It's okay, Randall,
when I have a business..."

03:57.193 --> 03:59.239
- Yeah.
-"...you can invest."

03:59.282 --> 04:02.154
We're gonna, like, officially,
like, set up a meeting

04:02.198 --> 04:04.331
to talk to him.
- No way.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.246
He's been waiting for his moment
to invest.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.812
I know. I was like, this is

04:07.856 --> 04:09.640
like a full circle moment,
you know?

04:09.684 --> 04:13.035
But I mean, like, jeez,
do you have any advice?

04:13.078 --> 04:18.780
Yes. You go in offering
a sandwich named after him.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.303
Of course.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.913
That's all he wants,

04:21.957 --> 04:24.307
is just someone to name
something after him.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.917
Legacy.

04:25.961 --> 04:29.051
I know, 'cause I don't think
he's getting a boy anytime soon.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.313
Oh, no.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.749
Gotta live on
through the sandwich.

04:45.285 --> 04:46.547
Got a vibe going.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.549
- Hello, hello.
- Yo.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.377
DJ James Kennedy.
- Look what I brought.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.857
- Holy sh--!

04:52.901 --> 04:54.642
- Oh, my God.
- I brought the big boy stuff.

04:54.685 --> 04:55.947
Boom, boom,
we'll shake the room.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.297
Wait. You gotta shut the door
for the dogs.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.342
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.430
Where is the dogs?

05:00.474 --> 05:02.606
- How you doing?

05:02.650 --> 05:05.087
How are you? Thanks for
coming over. I appreciate it.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.611
Like, honestly, the reason
I called you over, well, "A,"

05:07.655 --> 05:09.221
I ----ing love you.
- Love you, bro.

05:09.265 --> 05:10.788
I've been vibing with you.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.747
Usually I would be chilling
over at Sandoval's,

05:12.790 --> 05:15.489
but Tom and I are still
on a break.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.665
I just wanted to, like,
maybe soak up

05:17.708 --> 05:20.015
some of your experience,
some of your confidence.

05:20.058 --> 05:23.366
Also, ever since we decided
to move forward with TomTom,

05:23.410 --> 05:24.367
I knew somewhere
in the back of my mind

05:24.411 --> 05:26.238
that I wanna DJ.

05:26.282 --> 05:28.632
It's always been a dream of mine
to be able to play music

05:28.676 --> 05:32.201
in my own bars,
and I'm about to have two.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.811
Ooh, question, question.

05:33.855 --> 05:36.597
Say you're playing your set,
and the crowd's not feeling it,

05:36.640 --> 05:38.294
are you versatile enough
to pivot?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.165
You know what it is? It's like
that used to ----ing upset

05:40.209 --> 05:41.819
my whole night, of course,
and I used to just, like, um...

05:41.863 --> 05:43.430
- Yeah.
-...deal with it with booze.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.910
Bro, I would just go to the bar,
get another drink, down it.

05:45.954 --> 05:48.391
But now when people are doing
that, I have a clear vision.

05:48.435 --> 05:49.871
You know, it's not me.
It's them.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.047
Do you still go to AA meetings?

05:52.090 --> 05:54.484
- No, but I'm gonna go to one.
- Yeah, I'm just curious, yeah.

05:54.528 --> 05:56.268
Well, my two year's coming up,

05:56.312 --> 05:57.792
and I'm gonna quit smoking weed
tomorrow, like, yeah.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.271
- Whoa.
- I'm gonna, yeah,

05:59.315 --> 06:00.490
I'm gonna, like, go Sober Sally.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.231
Wait. You can't--
You can't quit weed.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.493
That's what everyone's saying,
right?

06:03.537 --> 06:05.843
Weed? Alcohol, whatever.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.062
I'm gonna try everything
for a month. Everything.

06:07.105 --> 06:08.542
Yeah.

06:08.585 --> 06:11.719
Weed has always just
made me feel normal, you know?

06:11.762 --> 06:13.373
Smoke it in the morning.
Smoke it in the afternoon.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.722
Smoke it at nighttime.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.637
I mean, I don't think, like,
I could function

06:16.680 --> 06:18.943
without it, honestly,

06:18.987 --> 06:21.468
but I'm willing to give it
a good shot.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.339
All right, so play that beat
and I wanna hear

06:23.383 --> 06:26.081
some of the stuff that you
would, like, say to a crowd.

06:26.124 --> 06:27.387
Everyone's in the club.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.953
Everyone's literally throwing
beer in the air.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.607
Everyone's taking shots
at the bar. Girls are twerking.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.392
That song is playing.

06:32.435 --> 06:33.654
- Play that sh--.
- Okay.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.046
What are we saying to the crowd?

06:35.090 --> 06:37.484
Hey, everybody, hope you're
having a good time.

06:37.527 --> 06:40.878
Oh, my God.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.445
I don't ----ing know
what you want.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.273
This is worse than I thought,
dude.

06:44.316 --> 06:45.840
Let's practice.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.146
Do you have that one song that
I listened to at my wedding?

06:48.190 --> 06:49.278
I would love to play
that song for you,

06:49.321 --> 06:50.410
but I don't have it right now.

06:50.453 --> 06:51.628
I'm not taking requests
right now.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.674
But, um, I appreciate you,

06:53.717 --> 06:54.718
and I promise next time
I see you,

06:54.762 --> 06:56.328
I will have that song.

06:56.372 --> 06:59.070
- This is my house, bitch.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.475
Knock, knock!

07:12.519 --> 07:14.085
What up, brother?

07:14.129 --> 07:17.219
- Come on up!
- I need all of this, bro.

07:17.262 --> 07:18.307
All right, all right, baby.

07:18.350 --> 07:19.656
Hey, what's up, man?
How you doing?

07:19.700 --> 07:22.572
Oh, good, bro. I need--
I needed to get in here

07:22.616 --> 07:24.748
and get into the room.
The blue room now, eh?

07:24.792 --> 07:26.271
- Yeah, well, blue and pink.
- Yeah.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.665
This is--This is my little baby.
I showed you this, right?

07:28.709 --> 07:30.493
- Massager?
- It's a vibrating front roller.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.755
Nice.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.714
So this is my style
of warming up.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.933
I'm sorry about the wedding
falling through, man.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.631
This evening would've been
the night, bro.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.763
- I know.
- Ugh.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.591
How long were you thinking
about doing this?

07:41.635 --> 07:42.940
For a while.

07:42.984 --> 07:45.290
I think I need your expertise
and your help.

07:45.334 --> 07:46.553
I'm gonna propose to Scheana.

07:46.596 --> 07:47.945
- So you're doing the engagement?
- Yeah.

07:47.989 --> 07:49.773
- And then getting married?
- Yeah.

07:49.817 --> 07:51.949
- On the same day?
- Same time.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.821
It just came down to, like,
they're like, look,

07:53.864 --> 07:55.344
actually, the space now
is gonna be worth

07:55.387 --> 07:57.694
20 grand for the whole venue.

07:57.738 --> 07:58.956
- And I was like...
- Yeah.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.524
-...that's not gonna work.
- It's a bummer.

08:01.568 --> 08:04.614
Between Homebody, child support,
and a wedding engagement ring,

08:04.658 --> 08:07.312
I can't afford that right now.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.792
It is what it is.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.490
If it's not meant to be,
it's not meant to be.

08:10.533 --> 08:11.969
Yeah. I mean, you just don't
love her enough, that's all.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.275
- That's all it is.

08:13.318 --> 08:16.060
I will run through
my ----ing walls, bro.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.542
All right.

08:19.586 --> 08:20.848
Thanks for doing this,
by the way.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.327
Usually, Schwartz is
my workout partner.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.199
What's going on? What happened
with all of that then?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.506
You know, me and Katie are
doing great. We're doing good,

08:26.549 --> 08:27.898
but I did tell him, like,
you know,

08:27.942 --> 08:30.248
"I don't wanna be the source
of, like, problems,

08:30.292 --> 08:31.685
like, with you guys.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.817
We should, like, take
a little bit of a step back

08:33.861 --> 08:36.254
as far as, like, friends,
and try to stick it--

08:36.298 --> 08:37.995
stick to just business."

08:38.039 --> 08:39.519
Things aren't perfect,
but I feel like me and Tom

08:39.562 --> 08:41.695
are getting back to business
now, pick up where we are.

08:41.738 --> 08:42.870
Like, I lost my spark
for the past few weeks, man.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.915
I've been in my head.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.701
It's like my wife's pissed
at me. Tom's upset with me.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.878
We decided just to maybe
not hang out as much

08:50.921 --> 08:52.967
for a while until we get
farther along with the bar.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.795
You know what I mean?
We're on a break.

08:54.838 --> 08:57.188
This is like a healthy break.

08:57.232 --> 09:01.105
Oh, wow, Tom and, uh, Brock
are working out. Check it out.

09:01.149 --> 09:04.021
Let's see. "Real friends
don't leave you hanging."

09:04.065 --> 09:05.719
♪newbestie?

09:05.762 --> 09:07.503
I don't think it's targeted,
honestly.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.766
The last, like, five
other photos are you and Tom.

09:09.810 --> 09:11.072
- Yeah.
- So it's like,

09:11.115 --> 09:13.683
who do you think that's, like,
pointed towards?

09:13.727 --> 09:15.685
I mean, sh--.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.600
- Let's do a ----ing post, bro.
- Really?

09:17.644 --> 09:18.775
It will be something light,

09:18.819 --> 09:21.212
like #TomandBrockgo[bleep]yourselves.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.040
- No.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.173
I've got--I've got
the right pose. Ready?

09:26.740 --> 09:29.046
- Oh, that's a good one! Oh!

09:29.090 --> 09:31.353
My caption--
"The next real duo."

09:31.396 --> 09:33.573
It's so...
- What? We're deejaying.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.836
- It's a DJ photo.
- So petty!

09:35.879 --> 09:37.228
- That's the DJ photo.
- Do it!

09:39.883 --> 09:41.058
- Oh.
- What are they doing?

09:41.102 --> 09:44.235
Oh. That hurts.
"The next real duo."

09:47.674 --> 09:48.631
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:48.675 --> 09:50.851
We got the prenup done.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.504
I encourage people...

09:52.548 --> 09:53.636
- Yeah.
-...to have a prenup.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.855
- What's yours is yours.
- Yeah.

09:54.898 --> 09:57.248
What's mine is mine. Go away.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.873
- Hi.

10:12.916 --> 10:15.266
I don't think she was ready
to wake up from that nap.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.703
- Come on.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.574
Hey. Here.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.358
You want a little bink, baby?

10:20.402 --> 10:23.274
- You want your bink?

10:23.318 --> 10:25.233
She slept till, like,
6:15 this morning.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.496
But I swear it was that
weighted sleep sack.

10:27.539 --> 10:28.889
I think it was just me
giving her her bath,

10:28.932 --> 10:30.717
and she slept that good.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.501
No, I think it was
the sleep sack.

10:32.544 --> 10:36.026
What do you think? Was it
the sleep sack or was it Nana?

10:36.070 --> 10:37.506
- Hmm.

10:37.549 --> 10:40.117
- Oh, she said the sleep sack.
- Wow, Summer. Okay.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.989
- Hello?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.120
Hello!

10:43.164 --> 10:47.516
- Hey!
- I love this building.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.692
- Thanks.
- It's so nice.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.867
Summer Moon.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.739
Oh, she's waking up.
Oh, no.

10:52.782 --> 10:55.306
Of course she is.
I should lay her down.

10:55.350 --> 10:56.786
Thanks. Do you want
something to drink?

10:56.830 --> 10:58.135
Do you want a La Croix or...

10:58.179 --> 10:59.397
I just have to be sitting
all the time.

10:59.441 --> 11:01.269
My legs haven't done much in--
for a while.

11:01.312 --> 11:06.666
Right? I know. Our gym finally
opens up here this weekend.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.711
Well, you know that EMS thing
that Katie and I do?

11:08.755 --> 11:09.669
Oh, yeah.

11:09.712 --> 11:11.235
- Get low with your arms.
- Yeah.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.455
Has anyone ever sh-- themselves
doing it?

11:13.498 --> 11:15.587
Oh, my God. My ass.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.635
- Like, my ass looks perkier.
- Ooh.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.203
I looked at it last night,
I was like, oh! Okay.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.944
Hold on. Sorry.
Brock just texted me.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.468
It's okay. What's going on with
you guys, like, tying the knot?

11:26.511 --> 11:28.600
- Do you know?
- Um, well, I feel like

11:28.644 --> 11:30.994
you guys know more than I do
about, like,

11:31.038 --> 11:33.475
the whole surprise wedding.

11:33.518 --> 11:34.868
'Cause he told me I couldn't do
the live podcast

11:34.911 --> 11:36.652
that I was gonna do
in Huntington this weekend.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.523
So I just assumed
it's happening.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.830
- Right.
- I got a cute little dress.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.658
He has a Step and Repeat,
photographers.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.529
He's like, "Yeah, you better
get your nails done."

11:44.573 --> 11:46.575
My mom made sure I got
my eyelashes done.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.577
But I didn't really know
anything.

11:48.620 --> 11:53.669
It kind of seems like she knew
more of the details

11:53.713 --> 11:57.107
than even Brock, who was
supposed to be planning it.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.500
I'm a little frustrated
with him.

11:58.543 --> 11:59.893
- Why?
- Because it's like

11:59.936 --> 12:02.069
you--you're getting
my friend's hopes up.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.766
He didn't wanna rush it.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.072
He didn't wanna compromise
his vision,

12:05.115 --> 12:06.334
and he was just like,
"You deserve the best,

12:06.377 --> 12:07.814
and if I can't give that to you,

12:07.857 --> 12:09.337
then, like,
it just has to wait."

12:09.380 --> 12:12.644
I want to give Brock
the benefit of the doubt,

12:12.688 --> 12:13.994
but he was thinking
that Randall and I

12:14.037 --> 12:15.169
would pay for his engagement.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.432
I mean, he already has
two children

12:17.475 --> 12:19.042
that he doesn't pay for.

12:19.086 --> 12:22.567
And now he doesn't wanna pay
to get married to Scheana?

12:22.611 --> 12:24.787
So we got the prenup done.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.876
We just need to go
and get that notarized.

12:26.920 --> 12:28.269
Okay.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.532
I never actually thought
I would do a prenup,

12:30.575 --> 12:31.838
but after getting divorced
and having to give up

12:31.881 --> 12:34.536
half of my bank account,
I was like,

12:34.579 --> 12:35.885
"We're doing this
the right way."

12:35.929 --> 12:37.321
- Yeah.
- And I feel like that's why--

12:37.365 --> 12:38.758
Don't play with that.

12:38.801 --> 12:40.934
With Shay, when the relationship
went to sh--...

12:42.152 --> 12:43.850
...to get him to sign
divorce papers,

12:43.893 --> 12:47.549
I literally had to split
my finances.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.551
So as much as I love Brock,

12:49.594 --> 12:52.162
this time around,
I need to protect myself,

12:52.206 --> 12:53.555
protect my daughter,

12:53.598 --> 12:54.861
and just put that sh--
in writing.

12:54.904 --> 12:56.688
- And did you guys do one?
- Oh, yeah.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.560
- I'm all about a plan "B."
- Yeah.

12:58.603 --> 12:59.866
That was definitely
a smart move,

12:59.909 --> 13:02.042
'cause I remember when I said
that Rand and I

13:02.085 --> 13:03.434
were gonna do a prenup...
- Mm-hmm.

13:03.478 --> 13:05.741
...you acted a little shocked
by it.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.395
Yeah, and then
when Katie and Tom did,

13:07.438 --> 13:09.876
I was just like, oh, that just,
like, takes the fun out of it.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.138
Like, you should be marrying
somebody you trust,

13:11.181 --> 13:12.704
who's never gonna
come after you.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.271
Oh, no.
When things get sticky...

13:14.315 --> 13:17.231
- And it wasn't even--Yeah.
- People really show true colors.

13:17.274 --> 13:21.017
I just want something that is
so clear and cut-and-dry...

13:21.061 --> 13:22.279
- Mm-hmm.
-...where it's like,

13:22.323 --> 13:25.195
"What's yours is yours."
- Yeah.

13:25.239 --> 13:26.849
"What's mine is mine. Go away."

13:34.204 --> 13:35.466
What's up, dude?

13:35.510 --> 13:40.123
- Oh! Let me see your face.
- Hi.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.472
- Hey.
- Hey, guys.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.865
Yo, what's up, Greg?
What's up? What's up?

13:42.909 --> 13:44.301
- How are you?
- We got, uh, Dan coming in.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.781
- Contractor.
- What's going on?

13:45.825 --> 13:46.738
So we're gonna show him
the layout.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.610
- Okay.
- Maybe--Maybe roughly

13:48.653 --> 13:49.741
have him price some things out.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.787
- Oh, hey.
- Hey, what's up, Dan?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.094
- Hey, guys.
- This is Greg, our partner.

13:54.137 --> 13:55.312
Dan. Nice to meet you.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.880
So he did the garden side
of TomTom.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.664
The extension at TomTom.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.623
The more the merrier
to get things done,

14:01.666 --> 14:04.147
so as long as we have material
and a game plan,

14:04.191 --> 14:06.410
we can make short work of this
and concentrate

14:06.454 --> 14:08.325
on trying to get open
sooner than later.

14:08.369 --> 14:09.936
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.721
We've been talking with Greg
about this spot for over a year.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.942
We're about to break ground,
and we have to get this open,

14:15.985 --> 14:18.205
because every day it's not,
it's costing us money.

14:18.248 --> 14:21.469
We're looking at doing like
a fiber optics starry night

14:21.512 --> 14:24.472
in the middle of the archways.

14:24.515 --> 14:26.953
But talking to Tom,
you would have no idea

14:26.996 --> 14:30.304
that we're, like, 12 months
behind on this project.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.435
Just real quick,
what about electrical

14:31.479 --> 14:33.046
going to the middle part?

14:33.089 --> 14:34.961
Oh, you wanted to do lighting
coming out of the ground?

14:35.004 --> 14:36.701
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.442
I mean, we are sitting
on a cement slab.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.835
We can open it up.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.489
We can, but then we gotta go
get this tile again?

14:41.532 --> 14:43.795
If we could have maybe, like,
the bar down in the bathrooms

14:43.839 --> 14:46.015
done in, like, a month,
that would really help out.

14:46.059 --> 14:48.148
The finishes will take
some time. Obviously, the de--

14:48.191 --> 14:50.802
You guys have, you know,
a really detailed bar coming up.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.501
So I think three to four months
is a really good timeline

14:53.544 --> 14:55.807
to get everything done here.

14:55.851 --> 14:57.809
All right, we need to do it
faster than that.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.812
All we need is some cosmetic
work, maybe a little face-lift.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.990
And I've seen people recover
from face-lifts,

15:04.033 --> 15:05.165
like, in a month.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.818
I don't think Tom Sandoval
experiences

15:06.862 --> 15:10.997
time, deadlines, and pressure
like other human beings do.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.999
So if you guys have all
those things ordered...

15:13.042 --> 15:14.391
- We will have everything.
-...I think I can cut it down

15:14.435 --> 15:15.915
to about two and a half
to three months.

15:15.958 --> 15:16.916
You know, we gotta all be
on the same page of what else

15:16.959 --> 15:18.569
we can put in there.
- Sure.

15:18.613 --> 15:19.701
Okay. All right, guys. I'll be
next door. I'll see you later.

15:19.744 --> 15:21.398
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, dude.
- Sweet.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.660
- Great, man.
- Appreciate it.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.835
- Thank you so much.
- Good to see you guys.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.054
- Later, boys.
- Thank you.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.229
- Bye.
- Bye. Cool.

15:26.273 --> 15:27.752
- Okay. Have a good night.
- Thanks, guys.

15:27.796 --> 15:29.450
Whew. How do you feel
about that?

15:29.493 --> 15:31.191
I'm feeling obviously we're not
as far along as we'd like to be,

15:31.234 --> 15:34.716
but I don't want that to take
too much wind out of our sails.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.761
Once we start breaking ground,

15:36.805 --> 15:38.720
I'll feel so much better.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.026
- It's just the timing.
- People are gonna be able

15:40.069 --> 15:42.550
to see what the place looks like
before we, like,

15:42.593 --> 15:43.986
completely change it.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.509
The reveal.

15:45.553 --> 15:49.165
We wanna have a little progress
get-together because,

15:49.209 --> 15:51.907
you know, we want people
to be able to see the before

15:51.951 --> 15:53.735
so they can appreciate
the after.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.911
Let's go have fun tomorrow,
make some drinks for people,

15:55.955 --> 15:58.870
vibe out, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.743
I just wish we had a little bit
more progress done.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.572
I can't wait to be sitting
in this exact location,

16:04.615 --> 16:06.226
doing the exact same thing
we're doing

16:06.269 --> 16:08.445
with it fully built out.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.012
- Yeah.
- And we're just like,

16:10.056 --> 16:12.058
"Man, we ----ing did it."

16:12.101 --> 16:13.624
Dude.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.497
Wait till we make, like, a good
$10,000, $20,000 mistake.

16:17.541 --> 16:18.803
[bleep], dude.

16:18.847 --> 16:20.762
That's so messed up.
I'm having a moment.

16:20.805 --> 16:21.850
- I know. I just...
- And you just sh-- on it.

16:21.893 --> 16:24.418
I'm just preparing you.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.508
<i>Coming up...</i>

16:27.551 --> 16:29.466
Someone at SUR got COVID.

16:29.510 --> 16:30.859
I had to quarantine,
and so now I'm like,

16:30.902 --> 16:33.079
I'm like...
what am I supposed to do?

16:33.122 --> 16:34.819
Should I smoke some weed?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.572
Graham, you wanna help me sweep?

16:51.793 --> 16:53.012
Nice.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.578
- Did he catch that?
- Yeah, he did.

16:54.622 --> 16:58.060
My sister's coming over
to help finalize everything.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.670
We're gonna call the florists.

16:59.714 --> 17:03.370
I can't believe that you
wanted to spend $150 only.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.415
I don't know how much flowers
normally cost.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.418
James and I have zero idea
about flowers

17:08.462 --> 17:11.900
except for they make
every party pretty.

17:11.943 --> 17:13.162
- Hello!
- Hi, Graham. Come on.

17:13.206 --> 17:15.338
- You're here.
- Hi. How's it going?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.123
Hi. Good.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.734
But Kate has been here before.
She's married.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.128
Which is great for me because

17:22.171 --> 17:24.260
I don't wanna be crying
over dead flowers

17:24.304 --> 17:26.915
at my engagement party.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.221
We have our kinda
seating arrangement.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.311
It's going to be by table.

17:31.354 --> 17:35.576
Lisa, Ken Todd,
Max Todd, and Mia,

17:35.619 --> 17:39.928
and then Katie, Tom Schwartz,
Ariana, and T. Sandy.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.103
I think it'll be fun.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.583
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's a good table.

17:42.626 --> 17:44.367
That's a good table.
I wanna be at that table.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.891
How does, uh, Lisa feel about
them going off on their own?

17:46.935 --> 17:48.415
She's been a huge support
for them.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.634
They officially decided
on the name Schwartz & Sandy's

17:50.678 --> 17:52.941
for their new bar,
and we're gonna go see

17:52.984 --> 17:55.204
the location of where it's at.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.771
Even though I don't drink,

17:56.814 --> 17:58.468
you know, I'm very excited
for the guys.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.123
- Can still enjoy the atmosphere.
- Absolutely.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.907
If you wanna see your table...

18:02.951 --> 18:05.127
Yeah. This is like a wedding.

18:05.171 --> 18:06.433
Well, the venue's like
a wedding.

18:06.476 --> 18:09.131
It needs to be kind of like
this formal,

18:09.175 --> 18:11.699
because it's such
a stunning venue.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.831
What are you guys doing
beforehand?

18:13.875 --> 18:15.224
The first day that we get in,

18:15.268 --> 18:17.922
we're gonna do
a paint and sip class.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.098
Cute.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.316
Maybe smoke a little weed
before.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.623
A puff--A puff and paint.

18:22.666 --> 18:25.365
James is actually
gonna give up weed.

18:25.408 --> 18:26.931
I know. That's what you said
last time.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.674
You're gonna tell Kate
that your goal for next month...

18:30.718 --> 18:34.243
- Oh, yeah.
-...is to quit marijuana.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.289
- That's amazing.
- Thank you.

18:36.332 --> 18:38.552
Yesterday was my day to, like,
start that,

18:38.595 --> 18:40.641
and then someone at SUR
got COVID.

18:40.684 --> 18:42.382
I had to quarantine,
and so now, I'm like...

18:42.425 --> 18:44.253
there's not much else to do

18:44.297 --> 18:46.168
except smoke some weed.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.172
If you've got to stay home
all ----ing day,

18:50.216 --> 18:52.043
quarantining, right?
I mean, I'm--I'm--

18:52.087 --> 18:53.741
I make music. I'm a DJ.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.308
I mean, obviously,
I'm gonna hit the studio,

18:55.351 --> 18:58.180
smoke some weed, and ----ing
make bangers all day.

18:58.224 --> 19:01.183
If it helps me
with my daily anxiety, um,

19:01.227 --> 19:03.751
and also my appetite as well.

19:03.794 --> 19:05.535
It sounds like
you don't wanna quit.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.364
- I don't right now. I really--

19:08.408 --> 19:10.061
I'm over the whole
judgey-judgey thing.

19:10.105 --> 19:12.499
Like, you wanna ----ing think
something of me, then go ahead.

19:12.542 --> 19:15.066
I'm just proud that you've gone
two years...

19:15.110 --> 19:16.372
- Thank you.
-...without drinking,

19:16.416 --> 19:20.202
and that's what means
so much to me.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.638
I saw that.
Congratulations on two years.

19:21.682 --> 19:25.033
Thank you, yeah. I literally
did it for us, you know?

19:25.076 --> 19:27.905
I did it for her.
And you and me.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.646
I love you.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.607
Okay, back to these tables...

19:33.650 --> 19:35.522
Uh...

19:35.565 --> 19:37.567
<i>♪ So give me all you got</i>

19:37.611 --> 19:39.917

19:39.961 --> 19:42.398
<i>♪ Don't fight it down</i>

19:42.442 --> 19:44.139
All right,
let's go to the store,

19:44.183 --> 19:46.620
Should I get some rosé?
Yeah, I should get some rosé.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.578
Okay. You get whatever you want.
I don't know if we need rosé,

19:48.622 --> 19:51.581
but...ooh, I just cracked
my wrist.

19:53.279 --> 19:55.629
Yeah, I wanna go in and grab
some stuff

19:55.672 --> 19:58.327
for our sort of progress party.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.372
You know, we're showing people
the space.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.634
- Oh.
- Have some cocktails there.

20:00.677 --> 20:03.158
- Oh, Brock's calling.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.290
<i>Heller?</i>

20:04.333 --> 20:06.944
<i>-What's going on?</i>
- Hi.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.424
What's up, Brock?

20:10.600 --> 20:11.949
The skydeck.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.657
Do you want me to go with you?

20:38.237 --> 20:39.586
Yeah.

20:50.727 --> 20:54.557
I wouldn't want it
to be like, oh,

20:54.601 --> 20:57.256
we're at James' and Raquel's,
like, engagement party,

20:57.299 --> 20:58.648
and then, like, they're like,

20:58.692 --> 21:00.476
"Wow, that was like
a dick move."

21:00.520 --> 21:04.001
Like, the only way that
it can be, like, pulled off

21:04.045 --> 21:05.829
without it seeming, like,
dickish,

21:05.873 --> 21:08.876
I think is if really, truly
nobody knows about it.

21:10.704 --> 21:14.621
I mean, I feel really bad
because I told Brock,

21:14.664 --> 21:15.883
like, "Don't give up on it.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.319
Just because your first plan
fell through,

21:17.363 --> 21:19.713
Like, we'll help you.
We'll figure it out."

21:19.756 --> 21:21.628
I just didn't think it was gonna
end up being, like,

21:21.671 --> 21:25.153
at James' and Raquel's
engagement party.

21:25.196 --> 21:28.548
I think James is--
if he finds out,

21:28.591 --> 21:30.680
no matter what,
he's gonna be--

21:30.724 --> 21:32.160
- He's gonna be pissed.
- Really? Oh.

21:32.203 --> 21:33.683
Yeah. I do.

21:33.727 --> 21:37.513
As long as nobody knows
until way after the fact...

21:41.343 --> 21:43.258
Secret agents.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.308
- Okay.
- All right, Agent Brock.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.354
Bye.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.314
Dude, if--if James finds out...

21:55.357 --> 21:58.665
- Dude...dead.
- He'll ----ing lose it.

21:58.708 --> 22:02.582
Just literally
nobody can find out and...

22:02.625 --> 22:05.498
They're not gonna find out
from me, that's for damn sure.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.369
It'll ruin the whole trip.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.675
Abso----ing-lutely.

22:08.718 --> 22:10.851
Then we'll have
a ----ing problem.

22:10.894 --> 22:12.418
<i>Coming up...</i>

22:12.461 --> 22:14.158
Are you coming to me
for investment?

22:14.202 --> 22:15.769
I'm a nasty-ass bitch boss.
You know that already, right?

22:15.812 --> 22:17.553
- Yeah.
- So if you want me--

22:17.597 --> 22:19.599
I mean, we wouldn't say no
if you wanted to, but yeah.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.261
<i>♪ It's my time</i>

22:30.305 --> 22:31.959
- Yeah. <i>
-♪ To shine</i>

22:32.002 --> 22:34.527
- Oh! Hello!
- Hi!

22:34.570 --> 22:35.615
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.007
- Mwah.
- How are you?

22:37.051 --> 22:38.052
- Good.
- You smell good.

22:38.095 --> 22:38.879
Come in.

22:38.922 --> 22:40.402
So I made some sangria.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.013
- I love sangria.
- That looks so good.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.102
- Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.453
Yeah, sit. So what's happened
since I saw you?

22:47.496 --> 22:49.585
So we had a meeting
for the sandwich shop,

22:49.629 --> 22:52.501
just to get down
all of our ideas,

22:52.545 --> 22:55.374
concept, vision for everything.
- Yeah.

22:55.417 --> 22:58.638
We want it to be
a gourmet sandwich shop.

22:58.681 --> 23:01.075
- So European.
- Yes.

23:01.118 --> 23:03.077
- So feminine.
- I wanna go to that.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.731
Are Tom and Tom
going to be involved?

23:04.774 --> 23:07.908
- No.
- But also I don't want

23:07.951 --> 23:09.431
Tom involved in what I do.

23:09.475 --> 23:12.347
Like, Jay-Z wasn't a partner
on "Lemonade."

23:12.391 --> 23:14.088
He can run his bar
with Schwartz,

23:14.131 --> 23:15.568
and we run this sh--.

23:15.611 --> 23:19.789
Beyoncé has literally everything
that Beyoncé's ever done.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.269
Jay-Z has, like,
"Hard Knock Life."

23:21.312 --> 23:24.751
That's kinda like me and Tom.
I mean, I'm not Beyoncé,

23:24.794 --> 23:26.361
but the--Tom and I are
on the show.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.754
I ----ing run that sh--.

23:27.797 --> 23:30.017
How do you feel about how
the guys are handling it?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.845
You haven't even seen the place.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.803
Well, the guys are working
on cocktails.

23:33.847 --> 23:36.719
I know that they want
a lot of us to just, like, come

23:36.763 --> 23:38.286
and see the location and...
- Yeah.

23:38.329 --> 23:40.462
I don't know what
you're doing tomorrow night.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.985
I'm sure the Toms would love
to have you

23:42.029 --> 23:43.770
at their progress party.
- I'll come.

23:43.813 --> 23:45.162
- Yeah.
- I wanna see it.

23:45.206 --> 23:47.774
But everybody's gonna have
an opinion, right?

23:47.817 --> 23:49.602
And Sandoval
doesn't like opinions.

23:49.645 --> 23:51.517
Well, when you know what you
want, you know what you want.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.910
Like with our place,
we wanna make a statement.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.782
Do you have any idea
how much money you need?

23:55.825 --> 23:57.131
Kind of, yeah.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.089
Are you coming to me
for investment?

23:59.133 --> 24:00.526
I'm a nasty-ass bitch boss.
You know that already.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.615
I mean, we wouldn't say no
if you wanted to.

24:02.658 --> 24:07.358
Okay, well, pitch it to me,
then. Tell me what it is.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.448
- I mean, um--
- We haven't, like, practiced it.

24:09.491 --> 24:12.233
Yeah, we haven't, like,
practiced our pitch,

24:12.276 --> 24:14.148
but Randall has been wanting
to get involved. We do know--

24:14.191 --> 24:16.411
Okay, so you're gonna pitch it
to Randall.

24:16.455 --> 24:17.499
Yeah.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.240
So from the beginning.

24:19.283 --> 24:21.503
So we want the space to be--

24:21.547 --> 24:22.852
- More energy. It's Randall.
- Okay.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.375
- Okay, so we want--
- It's gonna be...

24:24.419 --> 24:25.507
- Yeah, tell me how we're--
- The space is going to be...

24:25.551 --> 24:28.771
Unapologetically feminine.

24:28.815 --> 24:29.816
Okay.

24:29.859 --> 24:32.166
The name is...

24:32.209 --> 24:33.646
Something About Her.

24:33.689 --> 24:36.779
Mmm. Okay.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.477
Somebody About Her?

24:38.520 --> 24:40.783
It's not something I would call
my sandwich bar,

24:40.827 --> 24:43.525
but then I wouldn't call my bar
Schwartz & Sandy's,

24:43.569 --> 24:46.354
so go figure.

24:46.397 --> 24:48.661
You genuinely want to do it.
You're passionate about it?

24:48.704 --> 24:50.793
Yes. I want a purpose.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.493
I want more for myself.

24:54.536 --> 24:58.627
I'm not just gonna sit at home
and be...a wife.

24:58.671 --> 25:02.979
- I hear you.
- You're capable of so much.

25:03.023 --> 25:04.546
I know that.

25:04.590 --> 25:08.115
I wanna wake up and feel like,
I have a lot to do today.

25:08.158 --> 25:11.335
I need to go somewhere
where, like, I need to, like,

25:11.379 --> 25:13.337
spend my day doing something.

25:13.381 --> 25:16.645
- Being motivated by that.
- I am.

25:16.689 --> 25:20.606
And I know the baby thing
and not being involved

25:20.649 --> 25:21.998
with Tom and Tom.

25:22.042 --> 25:23.434
Is it something you think,

25:23.478 --> 25:24.653
"Oh, my God,
this could be mine"?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.046
Yes.

25:26.089 --> 25:29.702
I just feel like this is finally
what I needed.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.878
You know, it's my baby.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.490
Over the last couple years,
I was having, like,

25:35.534 --> 25:37.013
kind of, like,
an existential crisis.

25:37.057 --> 25:41.627
I didn't know who I was,
what I wanted to do.

25:41.670 --> 25:44.412
Now I feel like I finally have
found something

25:44.455 --> 25:46.283
that I'm gonna wake up every day
and be like,

25:46.327 --> 25:49.722
"I have something to do today.
I have somewhere to <i>be</i> today."

25:49.765 --> 25:51.245
Can you be our advisor?

25:51.288 --> 25:52.942
Well, it seems like that's what
I'm doing anyway, right?

25:52.986 --> 25:54.901
For free. Where's my percentage?

26:09.959 --> 26:11.570
- What's up, Kyle?
- Hey!

26:11.613 --> 26:14.094
- How's it going?
- Yeah, how are you?

26:14.137 --> 26:16.444
- Good. Good to see you.
- Yeah.

26:16.487 --> 26:17.358
- Ah.
- Okay. Nice shirt.

26:17.401 --> 26:19.142
- Oh, thanks, man.

26:19.186 --> 26:20.840
- I've arrived.
- Hey, what's up?

26:20.883 --> 26:23.016
How's it going, dude?

26:23.059 --> 26:24.931
- How are you, brother?
- Good.

26:24.974 --> 26:26.672
- Should we have a shot of Louis?
- Hey.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.195
Okay, all right, all right,
all right.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.457
Yeah, well, guys,
cheers to businesses.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.503
- To starting new businesses.

26:32.547 --> 26:34.244
- Cheers, boys.
- All right.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.290
- My man, do you have that ring?
- Which ring?

26:36.333 --> 26:38.292
- I'm just kidding.
- Ahh!

26:38.335 --> 26:40.816
- I have your ring.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.123
- The little ring?
- Yeah, I have--I have the ring.

26:43.166 --> 26:44.907
Well, let's have a look at it.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.736
I've been working with Karl
on an engagement ring.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.956
I think we started
at, like, an 8-carat,

26:49.999 --> 26:54.047
then we went to a 12.97-carat.

26:54.090 --> 26:57.006
It's a lot of carats.

26:57.050 --> 26:58.007
What's your thoughts
on all this?

26:58.051 --> 27:00.183
Proposing and marrying of Scheana?

27:00.227 --> 27:02.795
Well, look...

27:02.838 --> 27:05.536
the one thing that I will say
about the thing,

27:05.580 --> 27:07.713
like, with James, that's--
that's really, like,

27:07.756 --> 27:09.758
the only issue that I have
in my head right now.

27:09.802 --> 27:13.457
Yeah. I'll talk to her,
after she says yes,

27:13.501 --> 27:14.720
if that's something she wants
to do.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.460
She might be like,
"No, I don't wanna do it

27:16.504 --> 27:18.680
with James and Raquel.
I don't wanna do any of that."

27:18.724 --> 27:20.464
Scheana and I have both been
married before,

27:20.508 --> 27:21.814
and so I think this is
a great opportunity

27:21.857 --> 27:25.078
for us to sneak away and have
a little ceremony

27:25.121 --> 27:27.167
with some people
that care about us.

27:27.210 --> 27:29.212
Oh, I'm gonna finish this beer.

27:29.256 --> 27:30.474
I was looking at photos,
and it looks like

27:30.518 --> 27:32.172
a really nice place to do this.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.695
I know what Scheana deserves,

27:33.739 --> 27:36.524
and if I have a second chance
at maybe pulling this off,

27:36.567 --> 27:38.613
it could be special
for Scheana and I.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.006
I haven't seen that.

27:40.049 --> 27:43.183
Whoo!

27:43.226 --> 27:44.358
- Whoa!

27:44.401 --> 27:46.186
I was not expecting that.
Pink?

27:46.229 --> 27:49.755
Yeah, this one's a very rare
pink morganite.

27:49.798 --> 27:51.539
This one looks like
a pink diamond.

27:51.582 --> 27:52.845
Looks bigger than my fingers,
bro.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.107
Yeah.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.587
What's something like this run?

27:56.631 --> 27:57.806
$25K.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.329
- That's awesome.
- Bro, I'm the biggest softy.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.462
I'm about to cry looking
at a ring.

28:01.505 --> 28:04.595
Look, if this is
a $25,000 vacation,

28:04.639 --> 28:06.032
I would be like,
absolutely not,

28:06.075 --> 28:07.381
but this is an engagement ring.

28:07.424 --> 28:10.079
This is gonna be
for the rest of your life.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.299
I'm for it.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.822
- Gotta put it on three cards.
- Okay.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.390
My credit in America's
not that good yet.

28:16.433 --> 28:19.175
So can I get $4,000
on each one of them?

28:19.219 --> 28:20.263
Okay.
And then...

28:20.307 --> 28:21.612
-$2,000.
-$2,000 on that should work.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.397
- All right, I'll be right back.
- Thanks, bro.

28:23.440 --> 28:25.225
Between that and child support,
bro,

28:25.268 --> 28:26.835
I'm broke
for the next six months.

28:28.228 --> 28:29.838
I never got on one knee before.

28:29.882 --> 28:31.840
Even in my past relationship,
we just got married

28:31.884 --> 28:33.233
because we were having kids.

28:33.276 --> 28:36.149
Like, this is for the first time
that I realize

28:36.192 --> 28:40.544
I'm making a commitment
based on...love.

28:40.588 --> 28:42.590
- It went through.
- Yeah.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.375
- Great.
- Kyle, thank you so much.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.421
I gotta go up to the next spot.

28:47.464 --> 28:50.598
- Sh-- just got real.
- Sh-- just got real.

28:50.641 --> 28:51.555
All right, Kyle.
Thanks again, man.

28:51.599 --> 28:52.948
- Thanks, bro.
- Bye.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.428
<i>Coming up...</i>

28:54.471 --> 28:56.256
We're gonna be lowering
the ceiling here,

28:56.299 --> 29:00.477
and this front area
is gonna be a lounge area.

29:00.521 --> 29:02.175
They're in over their heads.

29:02.218 --> 29:04.394
Yeah, they're gonna lose
a lot of money.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.053
These masks are great, honey,

29:11.097 --> 29:12.881
but it takes 10 minutes
to wipe it off.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.404
I am feeling really good
about tonight, though.

29:14.448 --> 29:15.841
'Cause we are gonna be

29:15.884 --> 29:17.973
rock and rolling
any day here now.

29:18.017 --> 29:21.107
Any day now? I feel like
I've heard this before.

29:23.326 --> 29:25.285
Okay, where is this bar at?

29:25.328 --> 29:27.287
Looks like it's in, like,
a strip mall.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.376
Interesting.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.946
How do you spell
"Schwartz & Sandy's"?

29:33.989 --> 29:35.599
I'm just trying to find the bar.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.253
It's actually not that far
from here

29:37.297 --> 29:38.428
in the Franklin Village.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.256
I had an apartment on Franklin.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.998
Literally, those were like
my "Ho-llywood" days.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.565
- Is that what--

29:44.608 --> 29:47.089
Is that what you called
those wonder years of yours?

29:53.487 --> 29:55.881
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.534
This is when we come in
and around.

29:57.578 --> 29:58.622
Should we set some sh-- up?

29:58.666 --> 30:00.276
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.757
- I hate those plastic cups.
- You do hate these.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.847
I really don't like 'em.
I really don't like 'em.

30:05.891 --> 30:08.894
- Um...here. Hey, by the way--
- I mean...

30:08.937 --> 30:10.373
- By the way...
- What?

30:10.417 --> 30:12.985
Dude, um, I know we took
a little break,

30:13.028 --> 30:15.901
but you know, me and Katie
have been getting along great.

30:15.944 --> 30:17.816
You and Katie have been getting
along great.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.122
- We've been getting along great.
- Yeah.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.733
I feel like it's time
that we, uh,

30:22.777 --> 30:24.866
you know,
come off the break now.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.389
- Okay.
- Is that okay?

30:26.433 --> 30:27.695
- Yeah.
- I'm serious.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.305
As long as it's okay with you,
man.

30:29.349 --> 30:30.872
No, it's great.

30:30.916 --> 30:34.180
Re-establishing my bond
with Sandoval...

30:34.223 --> 30:35.224
I miss you.

30:35.268 --> 30:38.140
...it's a special moment,
you know?

30:38.184 --> 30:41.709
Me and Katie made you something
that'll make it official.

30:41.752 --> 30:43.319
Made you a friendship bracelet.

30:43.363 --> 30:46.409
- I think I'm gonna cry, man.
Don't cry.

30:46.453 --> 30:49.412
I just... I'm gonna say it.
I feel like he completes me.

30:52.198 --> 30:53.677
Should we start making
some sh--?

30:53.721 --> 30:55.114
Yeah, I got masks for you
right here.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.115
Oh, yeah.
Kinda wish we were fully open,

30:56.158 --> 30:58.900
but this is cool, too.
- Oh, wow!

30:58.944 --> 31:00.510
- Hey!
- Oh!

31:00.554 --> 31:02.904
So it's done.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.340
- Yeah, it's done.
- So you guys are ready to open.

31:04.384 --> 31:07.561
Yeah, we decided we don't need
all that, you know?

31:07.604 --> 31:08.823
- Yeah.
- Is this the hero booth?

31:08.867 --> 31:10.259
- Yeah, this is--this is--
- Yeah, right here.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.087
- You just sit on top of that.
- All right.

31:12.131 --> 31:13.219
- Yeah.
- I know it's a work in progress.

31:13.262 --> 31:14.785
But I really thought
that I would

31:14.829 --> 31:17.484
be able to sit down.

31:17.527 --> 31:20.356
Oscar the Grouch would be
comfortable hanging out in here,

31:20.400 --> 31:22.968
'cause it kinda looks like
a dump.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.883
But I'd like a chair, please.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.406
You guys wanna try this?

31:26.449 --> 31:27.711
Yeah, of course we wanna try it.

31:27.755 --> 31:28.625
Look at that. Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

31:28.669 --> 31:30.018
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

31:30.062 --> 31:31.063
And there's no name
for that drink.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.716
You can name it if you want.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.544
I'm not naming sh--, y'all.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.591
Tough subject.

31:37.634 --> 31:40.246
All right, well, to...

31:40.289 --> 31:41.377
this.

31:41.421 --> 31:42.944
- To this!
- To this!

31:42.988 --> 31:44.250
- Aw.
- I made those.

31:44.293 --> 31:45.425
- We're back.
- You did? That's so cute.

31:45.468 --> 31:46.905
Our friendship's fully back.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.341
The break was fine.
Like, the one thing

31:48.384 --> 31:52.301
that actually hurt my feelings
was...

31:52.345 --> 31:54.782
it was that post
that you did with Brock.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.392
I see you with Brock,
looking all hot,

31:56.436 --> 32:00.527
and I thought we have, like,
a sexual thing. Just...

32:00.570 --> 32:02.050
We can mix business
with pleasure again.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.009
- Responsibly?
- Responsibly.

32:04.052 --> 32:05.053
- Whoa.
- Hey!

32:05.097 --> 32:07.534
- Hey! What's up, guys?
- Hey!

32:07.577 --> 32:10.841
Welcome to the spot soon-to-be
Schwartz & Sandy's.

32:10.885 --> 32:11.625
- This is so cool.
- Dude, look how tall it is.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.018
- Like...
- I know.

32:13.061 --> 32:15.585
- Yeah?
- James, isn't that cool?

32:15.629 --> 32:16.673
Whoo!

32:16.717 --> 32:18.414
If you jump, you could touch it.

32:18.458 --> 32:21.852
Hey. <i>Viva la México.</i>

32:21.896 --> 32:23.942
Hey, lookit, we got a little
welcome cocktail for you guys.

32:23.985 --> 32:24.899
- Perfect.
- Welcome cocktail.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.422
- What's in it?
- Hey.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.859
Okay, that's fresh pineapple,
fresh ginger,

32:28.903 --> 32:31.384
a little pear, coconut vodka,
and chili chocolate bitters.

32:31.427 --> 32:33.603
- Ooh.
- I juiced it all this morning

32:33.647 --> 32:34.430
in my kitchen.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.564
Oh, hell, yeah.

32:39.305 --> 32:41.742
- It's moaning in pleasure.
- Oh, my God, Tom.

32:41.785 --> 32:44.484
Hey. There's the gang.
That's the team right there.

32:44.527 --> 32:45.964
Hi!

32:46.007 --> 32:49.010
That's Lucinda, Andrew,
and Aaron.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.490
Good to see you. Hi, guys.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.886
Okay, so it's clearly
not open then.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.019
It's a progress party,
but the point

32:58.063 --> 33:00.891
of a progress party
is to see progress.

33:00.935 --> 33:02.502
- Well, hello.
- Hey!

33:02.545 --> 33:04.069
Hi!

33:04.112 --> 33:07.333
Are you having a panic attack
yet behind the bar?

33:07.376 --> 33:09.639
And I'm still seeing
Mexican flags and piñatas.

33:09.683 --> 33:13.034
I mean, you didn't see
handcuffs and dildos

33:13.078 --> 33:15.123
at TomTom's progress party,
did you?

33:15.167 --> 33:17.604
What's this?
A vibrating ducky?

33:17.647 --> 33:19.823
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

33:19.867 --> 33:21.608
- Oh.

33:21.651 --> 33:23.827
I can't turn it off.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.047
Well, they're in my handbag.

33:26.091 --> 33:29.137
Guys, I wanna thank you all
for coming,

33:29.181 --> 33:30.834
some of you once again

33:30.878 --> 33:32.575
and some of you
for the first time.

33:32.619 --> 33:36.144
We have an amazing team,
have an amazing partner.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.667
And, uh, this is
the "before" picture.

33:37.711 --> 33:39.408
Whoo!

33:39.452 --> 33:41.280
You guys, by the way,
I took the liberty

33:41.323 --> 33:44.152
of creating a bootleg
of our sign.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.633
Oh! Show us!
Show us your sign.

33:46.676 --> 33:47.851
- Oh!
- It's just a...

33:47.895 --> 33:49.027
- Yeah!

33:49.070 --> 33:51.377
It's not. It's not <i>the</i> sign.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.378
Schwartz!

33:52.421 --> 33:54.423
- And Sandy's.
- And Sandy's.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.295
- It sounds right.

33:56.338 --> 34:00.908
I kinda had higher expectations
for the Schwartz & Sandy's sign.

34:00.951 --> 34:04.172
Very minimal effort here.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.087
Maybe they could use
a mood board.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.002
I wanna show you guys around
a little bit.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.482
- All right.
- Guys, hold your hand

34:09.525 --> 34:11.049
of your buddy,
and if you get lost,

34:11.092 --> 34:12.920
just go back to the bar.
We'll see you there.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.661
So one of the things that we
really love about this place

34:14.704 --> 34:17.968
is that when you see it
from outside,

34:18.012 --> 34:19.796
it looks very unassuming.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.060
So we wanna suspend that effect.

34:22.103 --> 34:23.626
We're gonna be lowering
the ceiling here,

34:23.670 --> 34:29.371
and this front area is
gonna be a lounge area.

34:31.417 --> 34:33.549
So there'll be archways
in the middle here

34:33.593 --> 34:36.813
with four 6-person booths.
- And you look up--

34:36.857 --> 34:39.294
So the archway's going
all the way to the top?

34:39.338 --> 34:41.688
- All the way to the top.
- Well, how much does that cost?

34:41.731 --> 34:43.255
I don't have an exact dollar
right now.

34:43.298 --> 34:47.215
It sounds expensive. You haven't
got a budget for all this?

34:47.259 --> 34:50.218
- Oh, we do have a budget, yeah.
- Yeah.

34:50.262 --> 34:52.960
I do appreciate Lisa's concern,

34:53.003 --> 34:54.657
but honestly,
this is our business,

34:54.701 --> 34:55.919
and kind of none of hers.

34:55.963 --> 34:57.530
You've got to have

34:57.573 --> 34:59.749
a good few hundred thousand
dollars in here.

34:59.793 --> 35:01.751
I wouldn't wanna spend that.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.927
Maybe 500, actually.
Change all the lights.

35:03.971 --> 35:06.147
- Changes the walls.
- Everything.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.235
I think they might have
these ideals in their head

35:07.279 --> 35:10.238
about the budget,
about the timetable.

35:10.282 --> 35:13.285
But I think it's gonna be more,
and it's gonna be longer.

35:13.328 --> 35:17.115
These are two people
that don't really know

35:17.158 --> 35:19.639
what they're about to endure.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.423
They're in over their heads.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.990
Frankly, I'm a little worried
for them.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.956
<i>♪ What you say</i> <i>
is what you really mean ♪</i>

35:33.000 --> 35:35.176
<i>♪ That is what is killing me</i>

35:35.220 --> 35:37.178
<i>♪ Oh, no, no, no, no</i>

35:37.222 --> 35:39.659
I appreciate you all, uh,
looking around.

35:39.702 --> 35:41.182
Enjoy yourselves.
Let's have some cocktails,

35:41.226 --> 35:42.879
and, uh, thanks for coming.
Cheers.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.708
- You got a boyfriend?
- I do.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.406
- So, you guys...
- Whoo.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.059
-...how are you?
- We're good.

35:49.103 --> 35:51.018
We're signing our prenup
Wednesday morning.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.021
- Oh, so you are doing a prenup?
- It's already done.

35:54.064 --> 35:56.197
- We're signing it on Wednesday.
- Yeah.

35:56.241 --> 35:58.591
- And I'm okay with that.
- And so--so what does he get?

35:58.634 --> 36:00.288
- Nothing? Nada?
- Nada. Zero.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.942
He gets to keep his motorcycle.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.378
Oh, that's a little generous,
isn't it?

36:03.422 --> 36:06.860
Well, actually,
Scheana gets 7% of Homebody.

36:06.903 --> 36:09.819
- 7%?
- It was the number I chose.

36:09.863 --> 36:12.692
- It's my favorite number.
- She deserves the best.

36:12.735 --> 36:15.085
I was, um,
y'all's first investor.

36:17.087 --> 36:18.132
Not every time.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.003
Yeah, okay, I was one time
I didn't.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.788
- I owe you 3 grand.

36:21.831 --> 36:24.051
- It was more than that.
- No, it wasn't!

36:24.094 --> 36:25.879
- It was 3--
- Honey, I invested more than 3.

36:25.922 --> 36:27.359
- Here we go.
- Over 10,

36:27.402 --> 36:28.925
and I said I wanted 7%.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.884
All right, that's a ----ing lie.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.668
- No--
- It's a lie.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.148
- It's not over 10 grand.
- In the very, very beginning,

36:34.192 --> 36:35.932
I don't want you to give me
a ----ing handout.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.630
This was in the very beginning.

36:39.197 --> 36:43.113
That's not--that's not what
it is whatsoever.

36:43.157 --> 36:45.768
So you're--you're very kind of
civilized with this.

36:45.812 --> 36:48.380
- Very organized.
- Oh, yah.

36:48.423 --> 36:50.469
♪ Because we're good as gold

36:51.818 --> 36:54.299
I'm gonna have
an Elephant in the Room.

36:54.342 --> 36:57.650
So you guys know about
the dress code color palette

36:57.693 --> 36:59.869
for the engagement party,
right?

36:59.913 --> 37:03.090
- Yeah. Earth tones.
- Browns, greens.

37:03.133 --> 37:04.439
Well, yeah, I was worried
that it was--

37:04.483 --> 37:08.269
Okay, for three days,
we're wearing earth tones.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.619
No, I'm not gonna ask that much
of you guys.

37:10.663 --> 37:12.447
I feel like that's so, like,
Bridezilla.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.144
I mean, I know...
Well, that's why I was like...

37:14.188 --> 37:15.711
Guys, you can only have
these colors.

37:15.755 --> 37:16.582
...Raquel doesn't seem like
she'd be a bridezilla,

37:16.625 --> 37:19.498
but then I was like...

37:19.541 --> 37:20.890
So...how do you feel?

37:20.934 --> 37:22.892
It's going well.
It's just, um...

37:22.936 --> 37:24.851
It's--It, um, sucks
to be behind schedule.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.853
I just don't understand
because I've been talking

37:26.896 --> 37:29.029
to you about it
for three months now.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.031
- So what's the hold-up?
- Yeah, it was all 'cause of

37:31.074 --> 37:33.207
the, like, permitting issues
that we're still dealing with.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.165
It took a while for us
to figure out the financing.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.690
- Have you got the loan?
- I got the business loan.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.431
- Oh, good.
- So I got the money.

37:39.474 --> 37:41.259
So if you've got the money,
and you've got the energy,

37:41.302 --> 37:42.869
why don't you start?

37:42.912 --> 37:44.740
The restaurant industry
is tough.

37:44.784 --> 37:46.481
You haven't even started yet.

37:46.525 --> 37:48.222
I know. I know.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.355
Look, I don't wanna negate
anything they do,

37:50.398 --> 37:53.096
because I'm supportive.
I want them to move forward.

37:53.140 --> 37:56.970
But so far, it seems like
they're stagnating.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.015
Any help, we can help you.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.061
Thank you. I appreciate it.

38:01.104 --> 38:03.846
- Get on it.
- We know you're invested, so...

38:03.890 --> 38:06.632
- All right.
- Thank you for coming by.

38:06.675 --> 38:08.198
Of course.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.288
Bye, Schwartzy!

38:10.331 --> 38:11.593
Ready for this weekend?

38:11.637 --> 38:12.768
How do you feel about
the engagement party?

38:12.812 --> 38:13.987
I'm so excited, bro.
I'm so excited.

38:14.030 --> 38:15.684
- Yeah?
- You know, the villa

38:15.728 --> 38:17.164
where we're staying,
it's just a whole vibe.

38:17.207 --> 38:19.079
Like, trust me.
It's gonna be amazing.

38:19.122 --> 38:21.211
Do we have, like, a down--
well, is there, like,

38:21.255 --> 38:23.431
quiet time at all,
like, when we're up there?

38:23.475 --> 38:25.041
- Or is just jam-packed?
- There's, like, an activity

38:25.085 --> 38:26.739
we're gonna do every day.
- Yeah.

38:26.782 --> 38:28.349
And we'll plan accordingly
around that.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.959
I love that.

38:30.003 --> 38:31.744
Look, I'm pretty sure we just
celebrated their engagement.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.963
- Will you marry me?
- Yes.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.928
So...if it's a good place
to get married, why not?

38:41.971 --> 38:43.712
What they don't know
won't hurt them.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.540
What's going on now?
'Cause you're two years.

38:45.584 --> 38:47.063
- Yeah.
- You're two years, bro.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.195
- Happy 2-year.
- Well done, bro.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.544
Two years?

38:49.588 --> 38:52.808
I was gonna quit smoking weed
right on the day.

38:52.852 --> 38:55.420
But I just don't think
I'm going to right now.

38:55.463 --> 38:58.118
Don't force yourself to say,
like, "I have to change more."

38:58.161 --> 39:00.033
You've done a lot. With alcohol,
it was a massive problem.

39:00.076 --> 39:01.513
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're two years clean.

39:01.556 --> 39:03.471
You know, I was just thinking
that, like, you know,

39:03.515 --> 39:05.647
maybe I could do it, but, like,

39:05.691 --> 39:07.649
it's just been a bit
of a stressful time

39:07.693 --> 39:09.129
with everything that happened,
you know,

39:09.172 --> 39:11.218
with, like, that girl
getting COVID at SUR.

39:11.261 --> 39:13.133
I had to stay at home.
I was in isolation.

39:13.176 --> 39:14.656
That's why I didn't
stop smoking.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.615
James is probably
the last person

39:16.658 --> 39:20.096
to take blame for anything,
but you have to be accountable

39:20.140 --> 39:22.055
for your actions and your word.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.578
Don't act like a little kid.

39:23.622 --> 39:25.319
I get how frustrating that is,
but, like, just say,

39:25.363 --> 39:27.016
"Because I was stressed out
and I couldn't handle it.

39:27.060 --> 39:28.583
So I was stressed out--"
- But that's not the truth!

39:28.627 --> 39:30.368
- But you <i>were</i> stressed out.
- Now you're telling me

39:30.411 --> 39:31.891
to fake the ----ing truth!
- About smoking?

39:31.934 --> 39:33.327
- Yeah.
- Yes. Yes.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.155
And that's really triggering me
right now, bro.

39:35.198 --> 39:36.417
That's not the ----ing truth!

39:36.461 --> 39:38.114
So take your ----ing words
out of your mouth

39:38.158 --> 39:39.681
and shove 'em
up your ----ing ass, man.

39:39.725 --> 39:41.074
But your actions did it.
So you.

39:41.117 --> 39:42.205
And look at your actions
right now.

39:42.249 --> 39:43.903
You're all up
in my ----ing grill.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.252
- You're so ----ing...
- I don't wanna be around--

39:45.295 --> 39:46.558
- I don't want you to do that.
- I don't want you

39:46.601 --> 39:47.994
in my ----ing business
every five ----ing minutes

39:48.037 --> 39:49.256
about every little thing
in my life.

39:49.299 --> 39:50.953
You need to learn how
to talk to people.

39:50.997 --> 39:53.782
Oh, and you don't need to learn
how to ----ing talk?

39:53.826 --> 39:56.306
- Duh-duh-duh-duh!
- I'll take that. I'll learn--

39:56.350 --> 39:58.178
Like, read a ----ing dictionary
or something.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.962
You're right. You know what?
My education is poor.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.616
- You're right.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.706
A lot of the dumb sh-- you say
is poor in front of people, too.

40:04.750 --> 40:06.186
James,
don't start saying something

40:06.229 --> 40:07.666
that you can't take back.
- No, he's already started!

40:07.709 --> 40:09.494
- He's already started!
- You know why I addressed you?

40:09.537 --> 40:11.626
Because I ----ing care,
but if you don't see that,

40:11.670 --> 40:14.324
I don't care. I will still--
- You're saying that you care.

40:14.368 --> 40:15.891
I haven't even had
a ----ing text from you

40:15.935 --> 40:17.458
since we've been working out
at ----ing Equinox,

40:17.502 --> 40:20.287
you've been bye-bye!
You've been, "Adios, amigo."

40:20.330 --> 40:22.115
I haven't even
----ing talked to you.

40:22.158 --> 40:23.943
We were hanging out every day,

40:23.986 --> 40:25.510
but we don't do that anymore
because you're busy.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.033
You're doing stuff.
I don't know. I don't know.

40:27.076 --> 40:28.774
You're probably hanging out
with Tom in his gym.

40:28.817 --> 40:30.166
- You're right.
- Who are you? Yeah!

40:30.210 --> 40:31.733
Where the have you been?

40:31.777 --> 40:33.387
Because after that--because
after that text message, bro,

40:33.431 --> 40:38.392
when I asked you to do it,
and it came with a...

40:38.436 --> 40:39.741
James' text highlighted

40:39.785 --> 40:42.265
exactly where we are
in our relationship.

40:42.309 --> 40:44.224
- I just reached out to you.
- Yes.

40:44.267 --> 40:45.704
And I was like, "Hey, can you--
are you down to do a shoot?"

40:45.747 --> 40:49.577
Your first response was,
"For free? LOL."

40:49.621 --> 40:51.623
It kinda just made me realize,
like, you know what?

40:51.666 --> 40:53.712
I don't have time for this
right now. I do have a newborn.

40:53.755 --> 40:56.323
I'm trying to work on my life,
and if I have to deal

40:56.366 --> 40:59.979
with that all the time,
it's just--it's exhausting.

41:00.022 --> 41:01.546
I'm literally out here,

41:01.589 --> 41:03.461
like ----ing gonna go DJ
your ----ing event,

41:03.504 --> 41:05.245
all this ----ing bullsh--.

41:05.288 --> 41:07.334
God, and you still aren't even
grateful for any of it, bro.

41:07.377 --> 41:09.902
it's--It's honestly,
it pisses me off.

41:09.945 --> 41:11.599
Don't do the shoot.
Don't do the DJ stuff.

41:11.643 --> 41:12.905
Oh, so now you don't want that.
Fine, then. Cool.

41:12.948 --> 41:14.428
- I will then.
- Cheers, mate.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.517
- Enjoy your whiskey.
- Cheers, bro.

41:18.301 --> 41:21.043
What the [bleep]?
What's going on?

41:21.087 --> 41:22.349
- I didn't say anything.
- Well, you called him dumb

41:22.392 --> 41:23.611
and you said--
- Oh, you just sorted it out..

41:23.655 --> 41:25.570
Oh, really? He called me
a couple names, too.

41:25.613 --> 41:27.223
He said a couple things
that I didn't even say.

41:27.267 --> 41:28.921
You <i>are</i> rude.
James, you <i>can</i> be rude.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.575
Brock wants to throw
the friendship card down,

41:30.618 --> 41:32.577
like, "Oh, I'm just looking out
for you, bro, buh-buh-buh,"

41:32.620 --> 41:34.666
but where've you been?
If you don't wanna, like,

41:34.709 --> 41:36.885
work on our friendship,
or you just wanna leave that

41:36.929 --> 41:38.408
in the dust because
you have a salty

41:38.452 --> 41:39.758
---ing taste in your mouth
about how I texted you back?

41:39.801 --> 41:41.237
- I wanna go.
- All right.

41:41.281 --> 41:42.935
I'm ----ing over this,
and I'm over you.

41:42.978 --> 41:45.154
Is this James' water bottle?

41:45.198 --> 41:46.982
This is what he was doing
to the water bottle

41:47.026 --> 41:47.853
the entire time he was
having that conversation.

41:47.896 --> 41:49.550
Jesus.

41:49.594 --> 41:50.943
Like, what is that?

41:50.986 --> 41:52.727
Like, I can't have people

41:52.771 --> 41:54.773
treading my ----ing toes
that much.

41:54.816 --> 41:56.296
I really cannot.

41:56.339 --> 41:59.517
<i>Next time</i> <i>
on "Vanderpump Rules"...</i>

42:01.344 --> 42:02.955
Look at that ass.

42:02.998 --> 42:03.782
There it is, baby.

42:05.871 --> 42:07.437
I can't afford to go out
and get a DJ

42:07.481 --> 42:10.702
and pay for models and all that.
Who can on a startup budget?

42:10.745 --> 42:13.008
You can pay for this,
but you weren't paying for

42:13.052 --> 42:16.142
the engagement/wedding
for Scheana.

42:16.185 --> 42:18.013
- Are you almost here? <i>
- I'm sitting here,</i>

42:18.057 --> 42:20.581
<i>signing loan documents</i> <i>
for a refinance.</i>

42:20.625 --> 42:21.800
When you're asking someone

42:21.843 --> 42:25.107
for hundreds of thousands
of dollars,

42:25.151 --> 42:26.805
you gotta show up on time.

42:26.848 --> 42:28.763
There's a lot of things I could
be doing at my office right now.

42:28.807 --> 42:31.897
Set timer 30 minutes.

42:31.940 --> 42:34.639
Santa Ynez, here we come!

42:34.682 --> 42:38.773
Oh, my goodness!

42:38.817 --> 42:40.601
- Look at this place.
- Hello!

42:40.645 --> 42:43.038
Like, holy sh--.

42:43.082 --> 42:45.606
And that was gonna be a surprise
shotgun wedding for you.

42:45.650 --> 42:48.696
But the only time we have is
when we go away this week.

42:48.740 --> 42:50.089
No one can know.

42:50.132 --> 42:51.873
I think we can pull it off.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.005
I'm really nervous.

42:53.048 --> 42:54.049
It was the way
you were coming at me,

42:54.093 --> 42:55.921
saying I shouldn't talk
to people

42:55.964 --> 42:57.226
the way I was talking to them.

42:57.270 --> 42:59.359
But I don't wanna walk on
eggshells with you.

42:59.402 --> 43:01.491
Don't need to walk
on eggshells, man.
