WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.441
Tonight, Daniel Lubetzky,

00:03.441 --> 00:04.944
the founder of groundbreaking
snack company KIND,

00:04.944 --> 00:06.648
returns to the Tank.

00:06.648 --> 00:08.217
You know, when you
hit rock bottom,

00:08.217 --> 00:09.954
you get scrappy
and you get brave.

00:09.954 --> 00:11.658
Okay,
historically, I agree about

00:11.658 --> 00:14.029
people need to have
grit and hunger.

00:14.029 --> 00:15.966
We've self‐funded.
She sold her house.

00:15.966 --> 00:17.837
You sold your house?
Yeah.

00:17.837 --> 00:18.906
Yes.
Wow.

00:18.906 --> 00:21.143
You're not persuasive.
I'm sorry.

00:21.143 --> 00:22.212
We need a mentor.

00:22.212 --> 00:23.247
Don't just tell me
you need a Shark.

00:23.247 --> 00:24.283
Whoa.

00:24.283 --> 00:26.387
Abracadabra.
Bubbles!

00:26.387 --> 00:29.426
You have convinced everybody
here and everybody in America

00:29.426 --> 00:31.665
that you have built
one heck of a business.

00:31.665 --> 00:35.171
Don't sell yourself short,
because you are crushing it.

00:35.171 --> 00:37.242
So do you want to
do this deal or not?

00:48.030 --> 00:49.433
First in the Tank

00:49.433 --> 00:53.074
is an environmentally minded
innovation in laundry care.

00:58.752 --> 01:00.321
Hello, Sharks.
I'm Chris.

01:00.321 --> 01:01.524
And I'm also Chris.

01:01.524 --> 01:03.361
We're the founders of
Sheets Laundry Club

01:03.361 --> 01:05.298
from Mooresville,
North Carolina,

01:05.298 --> 01:10.341
and we're seeking $500,000
for 5% of our company.

01:10.341 --> 01:12.479
Sharks, in my 20 years
in the U. S. Army

01:12.479 --> 01:13.548
flying helicopters,

01:13.548 --> 01:15.184
I was able to get
a bird's‐eye view

01:15.184 --> 01:16.755
of the world's
plastic crisis.

01:16.755 --> 01:18.525
I was shocked
by the way other countries

01:18.525 --> 01:20.194
were disposing of plastic.

01:20.194 --> 01:23.502
Sharks, the plastic crisis
spans across our cities,

01:23.502 --> 01:25.539
landfills, and our oceans,

01:25.539 --> 01:27.543
and surprisingly,
one of the biggest culprits

01:27.543 --> 01:28.912
is the laundry industry.

01:28.912 --> 01:31.918
And so we decided to take
matters into our own hands,

01:31.918 --> 01:33.254
and we started
Sheets Laundry Club

01:33.254 --> 01:36.393
to combat
the plastic crisis.

01:36.393 --> 01:39.433
We did that by developing
a patented, eco‐friendly

01:39.433 --> 01:41.236
dehydrated sheet
of laundry detergent.

01:41.236 --> 01:43.307
It's lightweight.
It's mess‐free.

01:43.307 --> 01:44.309
It's easy to use.

01:44.309 --> 01:45.378
And best of all,

01:45.378 --> 01:48.417
it's 100% plastic‐free
from start to finish.

01:48.417 --> 01:51.056
You very simply take
one sheet of detergent,

01:51.056 --> 01:53.729
and you toss it in
with your dirty laundry.

01:53.729 --> 01:55.064
At the end of
a wash cycle,

01:55.064 --> 01:58.505
it leaves your laundry soft,
fresh, and clean every time.

01:58.505 --> 02:01.143
It's more convenient
than liquids and powders,

02:01.143 --> 02:02.847
it's more cost‐effective
to ship,

02:02.847 --> 02:06.420
and it is far better
for our planet

02:06.420 --> 02:08.658
than mainstream
alternatives.

02:08.658 --> 02:12.031
Sharks, it's obvious
we care about the planet, so...

02:12.031 --> 02:14.804
Which one of you
wants to get hooked

02:14.804 --> 02:16.941
on creating
a plastic‐free tomorrow?

02:18.377 --> 02:19.747
So, in front of you,
you've got a glass bottle

02:19.747 --> 02:21.049
and a detergent sheet.

02:21.049 --> 02:22.252
Go ahead and pick up
that glass bottle.

02:22.252 --> 02:24.156
Take off the lid.
You can set that down.

02:24.156 --> 02:26.193
Grab the detergent sheet, and
then roll it up tight enough ‐‐
Smells really good.

02:26.193 --> 02:27.228
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:27.228 --> 02:28.532
Yeah, it does smell good.

02:28.532 --> 02:30.836
Roll it up tight enough
to fit inside that bottle.

02:30.836 --> 02:32.038
Now, pick up the bottle,

02:32.038 --> 02:33.207
and go ahead
and drop it inside,

02:33.207 --> 02:35.378
and notice that
the water is cold,

02:35.378 --> 02:39.620
and as soon as it hits the cold
water, it begins to dissolve.

02:39.620 --> 02:42.827
Now, once you've done that,
go ahead, grab your lid,

02:42.827 --> 02:46.534
and we're going to shake it
for a few seconds.

02:50.341 --> 02:53.013
Abracadabra.
Bubbles!

02:53.013 --> 02:55.853
We have turned your
detergent sheets into...
Wow. That's great.

02:55.853 --> 02:57.088
Bubbles.

02:58.257 --> 03:00.662
What are the contents
of the sheet?

03:00.662 --> 03:01.965
The primary ingredients

03:01.965 --> 03:03.935
in the laundry sheet
that we use for cleaning,

03:03.935 --> 03:05.873
it's a sodium lauryl sulfate
surfactant.

03:05.873 --> 03:07.843
It's derived
from coconut oil.

03:07.843 --> 03:10.114
It's a natural ‐‐
Stuff that
they put in shampoo.

03:10.114 --> 03:12.786
It's found in shampoos,
and the enzymes in it

03:12.786 --> 03:14.422
are plant‐based, as well.

03:14.422 --> 03:17.997
We're also not using a laundry
list of synthetic chemicals

03:17.997 --> 03:19.466
that are found
in mainstream detergent.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.303
Wait, wait, wait.
What do you guys do?

03:21.303 --> 03:22.873
What's your role?
What's your background?

03:22.873 --> 03:25.411
It's like, you guys standing
here, you flew a helicopter.

03:25.411 --> 03:26.915
Yeah. Yeah.
I find that a big jump.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.919
Like, what happened
in between...

03:28.919 --> 03:30.321
Sure.
...how'd you come up
with the idea,

03:30.321 --> 03:32.893
and what role do each of you
play in the business operations?

03:32.893 --> 03:35.599
Absolutely. So I am the CEO
of Sheets Laundry Club.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.672
When I was 18, I joined the Army
as a military police officer.

03:38.672 --> 03:41.511
My first 12 months or so
in the Army,

03:41.511 --> 03:43.682
I got an opportunity to fly
in the back of a Blackhawk.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.251
That was a game‐changer
for me.

03:45.251 --> 03:46.854
Shortly after
my 25th birthday,

03:46.854 --> 03:49.326
I graduated flight school,
became a Blackhawk pilot,

03:49.326 --> 03:50.562
achieved a dream
that I wanted to do ‐‐

03:50.562 --> 03:54.436
14 years around the world,
flying helicopters.

03:54.436 --> 03:56.173
But my lungs
are really bad,

03:56.173 --> 04:00.314
and the lungs got destroyed
over in Iraq in 2007 and 2008,

04:00.314 --> 04:02.987
and that's kind of where
my plastic journey started.

04:02.987 --> 04:04.255
It was a war‐torn country.

04:04.255 --> 04:07.529
They didn't have any type
of trash service established,

04:07.529 --> 04:09.199
so they were burning it.

04:09.199 --> 04:11.303
And everything obviously
rises to the skies,

04:11.303 --> 04:13.541
and I spent every single day
of the week, for the most part,

04:13.541 --> 04:16.346
flying in those skies
that had the toxins.
Wow.

04:16.346 --> 04:18.985
So about 6 to 12 months
after coming back from Iraq,

04:18.985 --> 04:21.156
I had a lot of wheezing
and coughing issues.

04:21.156 --> 04:23.227
I went to a pulmonologist
and found out

04:23.227 --> 04:25.398
that my lungs were now that
of a 70‐year‐old.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.903
I think I was about 33
at the time.

04:27.903 --> 04:31.109
So I've been on medication
for my lungs.

04:31.109 --> 04:34.049
My wife and I,
we decided to, you know,

04:34.049 --> 04:35.652
rid plastic from our home.

04:35.652 --> 04:36.821
I learned a lot about it.

04:36.821 --> 04:37.890
I learned that, you know,

04:37.890 --> 04:40.127
9% of plastic worldwide
is recycled,

04:40.127 --> 04:42.465
and 12% of it's burned.

04:42.465 --> 04:45.605
And the other 79% wind up
in landfills and oceans.

04:45.605 --> 04:47.543
So in 2018, I met Chris,

04:47.543 --> 04:49.914
and I was actively searching
for my next endeavor,

04:49.914 --> 04:51.149
'cause I had 15 years

04:51.149 --> 04:53.187
of starting businesses
at that point,

04:53.187 --> 04:55.124
but none of them
really had a big purpose.

04:55.124 --> 04:57.596
And so I was at a point in
my life, got a family now ‐‐

04:57.596 --> 04:59.600
I want to start something
that has a purpose.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.771
Okay, guys.
So what's in the box?

05:01.771 --> 05:03.307
You have a lot of
things in here.
What do we get?

05:03.307 --> 05:06.413
So, we have about 46 different
SKUs within our system.

05:06.413 --> 05:07.649
Wow.
It's about 30
different products.

05:07.649 --> 05:09.018
The varieties
are based on the SKUs.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.791
Oh, so it's not just the sheets.
It's all this other stuff.

05:11.791 --> 05:13.928
The main focus has always been
the laundry sheets.

05:13.928 --> 05:16.433
We have floor‐cleaning sheets.
We have scent boosters.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.137
The mission of
Sheets Laundry Club...
All your product?

05:18.137 --> 05:20.007
...is to remove plastic
from laundry.

05:20.007 --> 05:21.276
When were you guys
launched?

05:21.276 --> 05:25.184
We officially launched to
the public in January of 2020.

05:25.184 --> 05:26.787
And what were your sales
in 2020?

05:26.787 --> 05:29.627
In 2020, we did $2.046 million
in total sales.

05:29.627 --> 05:30.996
Wow.

05:30.996 --> 05:33.066
So $2.04 sounds
pretty impressive.
That's huge!

05:33.066 --> 05:35.705
What percentage
is your number‐one item?

05:35.705 --> 05:38.043
The laundry sheets are our
number‐one selling item.

05:38.043 --> 05:39.513
‐They are?
‐Out of those $2 million,

05:39.513 --> 05:40.882
how much did you sell
in those sheets?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.686
We sold
about $1.2 million.

05:42.686 --> 05:45.825
We also signed an exclusivity
agreement with Kimberly‐Clark.

05:45.825 --> 05:47.295
Kimberly‐Clark
owned the patent

05:47.295 --> 05:49.132
on the dissolvable
laundry detergent sheet.

05:49.132 --> 05:51.203
Do you pay them a royalty?
We do pay a royalty.

05:51.203 --> 05:52.573
Wait a minute.

05:52.573 --> 05:55.110
So you have it that you are
the only ones

05:55.110 --> 05:56.981
that can also use the patent.
Absolutely correct.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.718
Are there limitations
on that?

05:58.718 --> 06:01.356
As long as we pay
our royalties annually,

06:01.356 --> 06:03.227
that patent
is exclusive to us.

06:03.227 --> 06:06.066
So guys, the con is, I don't
think you own anything,

06:06.066 --> 06:09.807
and you've never answered yet
how long your agreement lasts

06:09.807 --> 06:11.677
with the large consumer company.

06:11.677 --> 06:13.514
Through October of 2024.

06:13.514 --> 06:14.817
20‐‐ That's it?
Yes.

06:14.817 --> 06:16.286
Then what happens?
Do you have an option to renew?

06:16.286 --> 06:18.190
It expires.

06:18.190 --> 06:20.494
So, I have three concerns.
Yes.

06:20.494 --> 06:23.133
One, you have a patent
that expires.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.204
Secondly, you have 46 SKUs.

06:25.204 --> 06:27.074
I see that as a formula
for disaster.

06:27.074 --> 06:28.477
It's like having
too many children

06:28.477 --> 06:29.980
when one kid's your good kid

06:29.980 --> 06:31.349
and you have to
give everybody attention.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.619
Yeah.
So I object to that.

06:32.619 --> 06:34.923
But thirdly, even
without the first two,

06:34.923 --> 06:37.328
you're not persuasive ‐‐
I'm sorry.

06:37.328 --> 06:40.000
For whatever reason,
forgive me for saying this,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.904
I don't think
either of you sell.

06:41.904 --> 06:44.309
You could have the best product,
the best production,

06:44.309 --> 06:47.081
you could run the best company,
make people happy.

06:47.081 --> 06:49.152
But if you don't have
that aggressiveness,

06:49.152 --> 06:51.356
hunger on the front end
of your business,

06:51.356 --> 06:53.060
it doesn't really go anywhere.

06:53.060 --> 06:55.230
So for that reason,
sadly, I'm out.

06:55.230 --> 06:56.834
No, I‐I think ‐‐
She just called both of you

06:56.834 --> 06:59.606
the worst salesmen
she's ever seen on "Shark Tank."
Yeah, absolutely.

06:59.606 --> 07:02.813
Yeah, we're on track
to do almost $7 million
in sales this year.

07:03.681 --> 07:05.217
That's a good answer.
Yeah.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.687
We've got a net profit
margin of 24%.

07:06.687 --> 07:10.260
Okay, so you're going from
$2 million to $7 million

07:10.260 --> 07:11.831
in one calendar year?

07:11.831 --> 07:12.999
That is correct.

07:14.135 --> 07:15.872
Why do you think
you hit that?

07:15.872 --> 07:17.274
Because Barb says
you can't sell.

07:17.274 --> 07:18.410
Yeah, we built it

07:18.410 --> 07:20.447
off of aggressive
advertising campaigns,

07:20.447 --> 07:22.619
and we got user‐generated
content right off the bat

07:22.619 --> 07:24.890
of customers talking
about our products,
how much they loved it.

07:24.890 --> 07:26.594
So quick videos.
Absolutely.

07:26.594 --> 07:28.363
Adding in testimonials.

07:28.363 --> 07:30.835
Where were you running them ‐‐
Instagram? Facebook?

07:30.835 --> 07:32.304
Yeah.
Social platforms.

07:32.304 --> 07:34.810
We just recently rolled out
some campaigns on Pinterest.

07:34.810 --> 07:36.012
We run AdWords.

07:36.012 --> 07:38.316
So I'm not a pound‐the‐pavement
sales guy.

07:38.316 --> 07:40.154
I'm a marketing guy.
I'm an e‐comm guy.

07:40.154 --> 07:41.389
Alright, guys, look.

07:41.389 --> 07:42.793
I don't think you have to be
embarrassed at all

07:42.793 --> 07:44.897
about salesmanship.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.901
You're blowing it
out of the water on revenue.

07:46.901 --> 07:49.706
But I have a deal
called Blueland...
I'm familiar.

07:49.706 --> 07:51.811
...which also crystallizes
cleaning fluid.
Absolutely.

07:51.811 --> 07:53.681
Frankly,
I'm competing with you.

07:53.681 --> 07:55.785
I'm going after
the same customer.

07:55.785 --> 07:58.190
I can't compete
with myself, guys. I'm out.

08:00.394 --> 08:02.264
So, I like the product,

08:02.264 --> 08:04.335
and I think the mission's
super important.

08:04.335 --> 08:06.406
I'm super worried
about our oceans.

08:06.406 --> 08:08.009
I'm worried about our planet.
Thank you.

08:08.009 --> 08:11.617
But you came in $500,000 for 5%.
Mm‐hmm.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.453
It just doesn't excite me.

08:13.453 --> 08:15.457
Half a million dollars
is a lot of money,

08:15.457 --> 08:17.896
and I want to be able to wake up

08:17.896 --> 08:21.402
and feel like I'm going to reap
the benefits of what I sow.

08:22.438 --> 08:23.908
This isn't for me.

08:23.908 --> 08:25.043
I'm out.

08:26.145 --> 08:28.283
So, $500,000.
What's the point?

08:28.283 --> 08:29.520
What is it that you really
need to do?

08:29.520 --> 08:31.122
And don't just tell me
you need a Shark.

08:31.122 --> 08:32.759
We want to expand
globally.

08:32.759 --> 08:34.796
We want to take this overseas.
We want to make a global impact.

08:34.796 --> 08:37.301
Okay, let's stop right there.
That's expensive.

08:37.301 --> 08:39.372
One of the biggest things
I try to teach my entrepreneurs

08:39.372 --> 08:41.175
is conserve your cash.

08:41.175 --> 08:42.879
You know what?
This just doesn't work for me.

08:42.879 --> 08:44.516
So for that reason,
I'm out.

08:45.685 --> 08:47.689
So you're saying
you have traction

08:47.689 --> 08:49.560
for $7 million this year?

08:49.560 --> 08:51.129
What degree of confidence
do you have in that,

08:51.129 --> 08:52.431
because if it's true,

08:52.431 --> 08:54.703
your valuation's
surprisingly reasonable.

08:54.703 --> 08:57.241
We've got over 21,000
monthly subscribers,

08:57.241 --> 08:58.644
so the recurring revenue
for the year

08:58.644 --> 09:01.449
is going to be close to
$3 million alone.

09:01.449 --> 09:02.819
We're working with
a CPG group,

09:02.819 --> 09:05.892
and hopefully in April,
we'll be in Target.

09:05.892 --> 09:09.131
Look, I historically agree
with Barbara's sense

09:09.131 --> 09:12.037
about people need to have
grit and hunger,

09:12.037 --> 09:14.743
but I'm somewhat persuaded
that you don't need to ‐‐

09:14.743 --> 09:16.446
maybe like Barbara and I
used to go to the streets

09:16.446 --> 09:17.716
and knock on every door ‐‐

09:17.716 --> 09:20.888
if you know how to do it
with your digital savviness.

09:20.888 --> 09:23.761
I will give you...

09:23.761 --> 09:25.999
$500,000 for 10% of the company.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.303
Okay.

09:28.303 --> 09:29.806
I'm extremely grateful
for the offer,

09:29.806 --> 09:33.380
and we came in with our ceiling
being at 8%.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.587
We would do $500,000
for 8%.

09:36.587 --> 09:38.557
Can we meet there?

09:38.557 --> 09:42.264
How about $500,000 for 8%
and 2% in advisory shares?

09:42.264 --> 09:44.903
‐So $500,000 for 10%?
‐Yes.

09:44.903 --> 09:46.205
There are so many
other things

09:46.205 --> 09:47.609
that we haven't even
covered yet.

09:47.609 --> 09:50.347
So do you want to do
this deal or not?

09:50.347 --> 09:52.719
Can we take just 10 seconds?
To talk?

10:01.503 --> 10:02.639
Alright.
We're ready.

10:02.639 --> 10:03.874
Decision made.
We'll do it.

10:03.874 --> 10:05.110
‐Good!
‐Wow!

10:05.110 --> 10:06.312
‐Good job.
‐Thank you. I Appreciate it.

10:06.312 --> 10:07.448
‐Good luck.
‐Thank you, Daniel.

10:07.448 --> 10:08.884
‐Thank you so much.
‐We are so excited.

10:08.884 --> 10:10.487
Congratulations, guys.
Well done.

10:10.487 --> 10:11.690
Good luck, guys.

10:11.690 --> 10:14.328
Alright.
Thank you very much.

10:14.328 --> 10:15.998
Daniel's story
is inspirational.

10:15.998 --> 10:18.236
Just to get somebody
that's in a sustainable space,

10:18.236 --> 10:19.806
for us, is huge.

10:19.806 --> 10:22.411
So I know his knowledge
is going to help us grow

10:22.411 --> 10:25.551
and just eliminate plastic
worldwide so much faster.

10:35.772 --> 10:39.946
Next up is an elevated version
of a well‐known craft.

10:43.453 --> 10:44.890
Somebody's serious.

10:48.764 --> 10:51.503
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Ashley Silfies.

10:51.503 --> 10:53.808
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Brittany Silfies.

10:53.808 --> 10:56.045
So we are not only
business partners,

10:56.045 --> 10:57.982
but we are also
a wife team.

10:57.982 --> 11:01.022
Today, we are asking for
$400,000

11:01.022 --> 11:03.426
in exchange for 5%
of our business,

11:03.426 --> 11:05.731
Pink Picasso.

11:05.731 --> 11:08.771
Each Pink Picasso kit comes
with a high‐quality canvas

11:08.771 --> 11:10.575
with a template
for you to paint,

11:10.575 --> 11:12.745
as well as the paint
and brushes you need

11:12.745 --> 11:14.749
to create
your own masterpiece.

11:14.749 --> 11:17.221
All of that is packed
into a giftable tube

11:17.221 --> 11:19.091
that shows what your image
can look like,

11:19.091 --> 11:22.231
as well as estimated time
it'll take to complete it.

11:22.231 --> 11:23.734
And when you're finished,

11:23.734 --> 11:25.437
you can hang your painting
on the wall,

11:25.437 --> 11:27.341
and you can be so proud
of what you did.

11:27.341 --> 11:30.848
We believe we've created
a truly modern‐day craft,

11:30.848 --> 11:32.886
one that you can work
at your own pace,

11:32.886 --> 11:35.791
making it a relaxing
and enjoyable hobby.

11:35.791 --> 11:37.862
So don't you think
it's just super neat

11:37.862 --> 11:39.633
that anybody
can be an artist?

11:39.633 --> 11:43.139
So, Sharks, who's ready to
create your own masterpiece

11:43.139 --> 11:44.308
with Pink Picasso?

11:44.308 --> 11:45.745
‐Let's go.
‐Yeah.

11:45.745 --> 11:47.715
‐So these are beautiful.
‐Thank you.

11:47.715 --> 11:51.188
These are ‐‐
Are these painted from this?

11:51.188 --> 11:52.424
Yes, it's like she said ‐‐

11:52.424 --> 11:54.796
every single thing you need
comes in the tube,

11:54.796 --> 11:57.702
and most of these images
are my own photography.

11:57.702 --> 11:59.271
And so we turned them
into a kit,

11:59.271 --> 12:01.275
and you just basically
sit down and paint.

12:01.275 --> 12:03.046
It's just paint by numbers,
right?
Right.

12:03.046 --> 12:05.584
So what we found is
everybody needs self‐care.

12:05.584 --> 12:07.755
This is something
that anybody can do.

12:07.755 --> 12:09.926
Everybody loves puzzles,
right?

12:09.926 --> 12:11.930
But it requires you
to keep it out all the time.

12:11.930 --> 12:14.970
And so this, you can roll it up
once it's dry.

12:14.970 --> 12:16.540
I mean, don't
roll it up wet, right?

12:16.540 --> 12:18.009
But once it's dry,
you can roll it up

12:18.009 --> 12:19.111
and put it
back in the tube

12:19.111 --> 12:20.548
until the next time
you're ready to paint.

12:20.548 --> 12:22.117
How did the two of you meet?

12:23.152 --> 12:24.188
Funny story.

12:24.188 --> 12:25.858
About 3 1/2 years ago,

12:25.858 --> 12:27.461
our life looked
completely different.

12:27.461 --> 12:29.699
We were married
to our husbands

12:29.699 --> 12:32.237
that we had been with
for over a decade,

12:32.237 --> 12:35.110
and we were just best friends
doing life together.

12:35.110 --> 12:38.149
And then one day,
our feelings just evolved,

12:38.149 --> 12:39.385
and we blew up our lives.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.288
It was not glamorous at all.

12:41.288 --> 12:43.894
When we did that, I mean,
when you blow up your lives ‐‐

12:43.894 --> 12:45.296
We were both basically
stay‐at‐home moms,

12:45.296 --> 12:46.499
and we had no money.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.704
So we were in two apartments
with three children

12:48.704 --> 12:51.308
saying, "Okay,
our kids are used to

12:51.308 --> 12:53.580
that American
middle‐class life.

12:53.580 --> 12:54.716
What are we gonna do?"

12:54.716 --> 12:56.419
And, you know,
when you hit rock bottom,

12:56.419 --> 12:58.657
you get scrappy
and you get brave...

12:58.657 --> 13:00.226
Yes, you do.
...and you don't have time
to worry about that,

13:00.226 --> 13:01.997
because you have kids
to take care of.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.168
And so she literally
sat in the apartment

13:04.168 --> 13:05.470
and was staring
at the wall, saying,

13:05.470 --> 13:07.675
"What can we do to provide
for our children

13:07.675 --> 13:09.646
and create the life
that we want to have?"

13:09.646 --> 13:11.282
Why did you think of this?

13:11.282 --> 13:13.486
She actually was sitting there
looking at the wall,

13:13.486 --> 13:15.290
and she said,
"What skills do I have?"

13:15.290 --> 13:18.196
Photography and manufacturing
were her background.

13:18.196 --> 13:19.699
Like,
that was the biggest thing.

13:19.699 --> 13:22.337
I was like,
"What can we package beautifully

13:22.337 --> 13:24.709
and go into market
and just own it?"

13:24.709 --> 13:26.045
So up until last summer,

13:26.045 --> 13:28.584
Ashley and I did everything
from start to finish.

13:28.584 --> 13:31.355
I made labels, and then we would
go downstairs at night

13:31.355 --> 13:32.758
and we'd pack boxes.

13:32.758 --> 13:33.894
All the kids
were helping,

13:33.894 --> 13:35.965
including our little one,
passing tubes.

13:35.965 --> 13:37.768
What a life lesson
for your kids.

13:37.768 --> 13:40.473
And y'all, they are
such good workers.

13:42.545 --> 13:44.248
Why don't you ban them
from going to college

13:44.248 --> 13:45.651
and keep them
in the basement?

13:45.651 --> 13:47.420
No, we really enjoy
their company.

13:47.420 --> 13:49.759
If I'm being super honest,
we want them to know

13:49.759 --> 13:51.796
that you have to work
really hard.

13:51.796 --> 13:53.266
Amen to that.
Amen to that.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.738
And the family that works
together stays together.

13:55.738 --> 13:58.209
So, there's got to be
a lot of these out there.

13:58.209 --> 14:00.046
There's nothing proprietary
about what you're doing.

14:00.046 --> 14:02.985
My question really goes to
the $400,000 for 5%

14:02.985 --> 14:05.691
imputes an $8 million
valuation.

14:05.691 --> 14:08.129
Yippee‐ai‐yo‐kai‐yay.
Yes.

14:08.129 --> 14:10.166
You must have a ton of sales.

14:10.166 --> 14:11.703
We do.

14:11.703 --> 14:14.642
So, we started in 2019.

14:14.642 --> 14:18.517
We went to market
having spent $1,500 on product

14:18.517 --> 14:20.554
and sold out repeatedly.

14:20.554 --> 14:23.092
So, our first year, we won
Oprah's Favorite Things.

14:23.092 --> 14:25.029
‐You did? Wow.
‐Whoa.

14:25.029 --> 14:27.033
What a lucky break.
Whoa.
Right, right.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.338
So we did $1.3 million
in our first year.

14:29.338 --> 14:30.340
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

14:30.340 --> 14:31.576
What about 2020?

14:31.576 --> 14:33.479
2020 was...

14:33.479 --> 14:34.749
$3.5 million.
...3.5, yeah.

14:34.749 --> 14:36.418
‐Wow.
‐Wow.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.091
What does it cost to make,
and what do you sell it for?

14:39.091 --> 14:41.428
For our 16x20 Adults,

14:41.428 --> 14:45.537
the costs are $3.77 to make,
and it's $4.00 landed.

14:45.537 --> 14:49.478
It wholesales for $19,
but resales for $42.

14:49.478 --> 14:51.048
Oh, wow.
There's a ton of margin.
My God!

14:51.048 --> 14:51.983
Yes.
Yeah.

14:51.983 --> 14:54.021
These cost you
$4 to produce?

14:54.021 --> 14:55.724
Yes.
That's insane.

14:55.724 --> 14:57.327
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

14:58.630 --> 15:00.901
2021, what were
your revenues to date?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.605
So, $1.4.

15:02.605 --> 15:04.408
We think we're gonna end up,
the year,

15:04.408 --> 15:05.410
over $5 million.

15:05.410 --> 15:06.746
Over $5 million?
Wow.

15:06.746 --> 15:08.784
$5 million in
gross revenue?
Gross revenue.

15:08.784 --> 15:11.121
So at $5 million,
what are your net margins ‐‐

15:11.121 --> 15:13.560
like, your profit margins,
after everything?

15:13.560 --> 15:15.764
Last year, we brought home
around $900,000.

15:15.764 --> 15:17.133
Wow.
I mean, basically,

15:17.133 --> 15:18.970
you're extremely profitable.
Right.

15:18.970 --> 15:21.342
Like, you have
incredible margins.

15:21.342 --> 15:24.582
So I'm curious ‐‐
what do you need from a Shark?

15:24.582 --> 15:26.553
We need a mentor.

15:26.553 --> 15:30.026
I feel like I don't know
anything about here forward.

15:30.026 --> 15:31.495
Like, we need a bigger bat.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.567
I have a bucket list retailer
that I'd like to be in,

15:33.567 --> 15:34.635
and they've said no.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.004
Are you in Michaels?

15:36.004 --> 15:37.006
No.
No, we are not.

15:37.006 --> 15:38.710
Why not?

15:38.710 --> 15:39.946
We need a bigger bat.
She just brought it up.

15:39.946 --> 15:43.687
It's really hard
when it's just the two of us.

15:43.687 --> 15:45.524
Like, I've never done
anything big‐box.

15:45.524 --> 15:47.360
I've only done
these boutiques.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.899
Like, we're in over
2,100 boutiques, right?

15:49.899 --> 15:50.968
I know how to do that,

15:50.968 --> 15:52.270
but we don't know how
to do the Target.

15:52.270 --> 15:54.942
So you need a Shark
to call Michaels. Well...

15:54.942 --> 15:56.311
Right.
I know Michaels.

15:56.311 --> 15:57.815
I also want licensing.

15:57.815 --> 15:59.084
I want to be in
Disney World and Disneyland.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.088
So you want to license Disney?

16:01.088 --> 16:02.892
So you want someone
to make calls

16:02.892 --> 16:04.829
to set up the Disney licensing.

16:04.829 --> 16:06.198
Let me give you a point.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.169
Lovepop greeting cards,
like you guys,

16:08.169 --> 16:10.440
stood here with nothing when
they showed up on "Shark Tank."

16:10.440 --> 16:11.976
Now they have
the Star Wars license.

16:11.976 --> 16:13.045
They have the Disney license.

16:13.045 --> 16:14.047
They've got
every license they want.

16:14.047 --> 16:15.316
They got the Beatles.

16:16.586 --> 16:18.389
You want to get there?
Right.

16:18.389 --> 16:20.661
Alright. Here's a deal for you.
I'll make you an offer.

16:20.661 --> 16:23.967
The $400,000,
I want to be a 1/3 partner.

16:23.967 --> 16:25.671
Ooh.
33 1/3%.

16:25.671 --> 16:27.541
I want a share
in the distributions,

16:27.541 --> 16:30.948
'cause I'm not a control guy,
so we're partners together.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.718
We decide how much capital
goes into the business,

16:32.718 --> 16:33.887
how much
we distribute to ourselves.

16:33.887 --> 16:36.024
You got to feed your kids,
okay?

16:36.024 --> 16:39.264
This is a really interesting
business.

16:39.264 --> 16:41.435
Listen.
You two are amazing.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.339
Thank you.
Just my cup of tea.

16:43.339 --> 16:44.675
Thank you.
You are dynamos.

16:44.675 --> 16:47.882
So, I love the look of it,
I think it's beautiful,

16:47.882 --> 16:49.184
and I think we're in an age

16:49.184 --> 16:52.691
where people are trying to
get away from the phone

16:52.691 --> 16:56.398
and spend time doing things
that are creative,

16:56.398 --> 16:59.972
that have to do with improving
your mind in a different way.

16:59.972 --> 17:01.876
So I think you are spot on,

17:01.876 --> 17:04.281
and that's why
you have done so well,

17:04.281 --> 17:06.719
besides who you are and
the drive of what you've done.

17:06.719 --> 17:07.922
So Lori,
is there an offer in there?

17:07.922 --> 17:11.729
So Daniel saw all of that
potential in you, too,

17:11.729 --> 17:14.501
and he said, "Why don't we
do this together?"

17:14.501 --> 17:16.806
If you're interested
in two super‐Sharks

17:16.806 --> 17:18.610
that are very complimentary,

17:18.610 --> 17:22.350
we'd do it for $400,000
for 20% of the company.

17:23.485 --> 17:25.456
I want to
just give you some feedback

17:25.456 --> 17:27.828
and then address
the subject of an offer.

17:27.828 --> 17:30.499
I remember distinctly
when I was building my business

17:30.499 --> 17:32.972
at the point
you are at right now,

17:32.972 --> 17:36.011
I was doing very well
very quickly,

17:36.011 --> 17:39.652
and I remember thinking,
"Wow, do I need help."

17:39.652 --> 17:42.223
And I almost brought in
a financial partner

17:42.223 --> 17:43.927
and sold half my business,

17:43.927 --> 17:47.668
because I realized it was
beyond me and my knowledge base

17:47.668 --> 17:49.872
as to how I could grow
and compete with the big guys.

17:49.872 --> 17:52.443
So I thought I needed
a big guy in.

17:52.443 --> 17:54.849
Thank God I didn't take in
the big guy.

17:54.849 --> 17:57.521
Thank God. He would have
had me for breakfast, alright?

17:57.521 --> 17:59.157
So I don't think
you need a Shark.

17:59.157 --> 18:01.194
It's no big science
to get into the ‐‐

18:01.194 --> 18:02.931
Barbara, why are you on
"Shark Tank," by the way?
One second.

18:02.931 --> 18:04.067
Wait, excuse me.

18:04.067 --> 18:06.471
No big deal getting into
any store you want.

18:06.471 --> 18:08.208
You simply make a wish list,

18:08.208 --> 18:11.348
and then hiring the right people
to help you execute it, alright?

18:11.348 --> 18:13.018
But I just want to
caution you

18:13.018 --> 18:15.456
before you jump into bed
with a lot of Sharks.

18:15.456 --> 18:17.628
Think about
what you really need.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.732
You've got
all the knowledge base.

18:19.732 --> 18:20.934
You just need more help.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.070
Are you in or out?
So on that basis, I'm out.

18:22.070 --> 18:23.472
I can help
you guys out.

18:23.472 --> 18:25.577
Her free advice is worth every
penny you're paying for it.

18:25.577 --> 18:27.180
Okay,
with all due respect,

18:27.180 --> 18:29.552
I don't agree with
what Barbara's saying.

18:29.552 --> 18:32.390
People ask me, what is
coming out of COVID?

18:32.390 --> 18:33.425
What is happening?
Right.

18:33.425 --> 18:34.862
And what is happening is,

18:34.862 --> 18:38.235
an influx of people wanting
to start their own businesses.

18:38.235 --> 18:42.009
So you have a beautiful idea.
You're super successful.

18:42.009 --> 18:44.548
And now what you've got to do
is race faster...

18:44.548 --> 18:47.186
Right.
...because other people
are gonna be on your tail.

18:47.186 --> 18:49.658
Now the good news is here,
you have two offers.

18:49.658 --> 18:51.194
I've got to say
one more thing, right?

18:51.194 --> 18:53.232
Don't sell yourselves short.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.771
So I'm not here
to make you an offer,

18:55.771 --> 18:58.442
because I'm not as good a fit,
even as those two, honestly.

18:58.442 --> 19:01.014
But at the same time,
don't sell yourselves short,

19:01.014 --> 19:03.018
because you are crushing it.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.624
What you have
is a very valuable business.

19:05.624 --> 19:06.793
You guys, you have convinced

19:06.793 --> 19:08.530
everybody here
and everybody in America

19:08.530 --> 19:11.702
that you have built
one heck of a business.
Thank you.

19:11.702 --> 19:13.940
But you got to make a decision.
You got two offers.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.278
What do you want to do?

19:16.278 --> 19:17.548
I'm gonna come back in.

19:28.180 --> 19:29.196
Two Sharks are out.

19:29.196 --> 19:31.600
Ashley and Brittany
have two offers on the table

19:31.600 --> 19:34.139
for their paint‐by‐numbers kit
Pink Picasso,

19:34.139 --> 19:36.410
but Barbara may have had
a change of heart.

19:36.410 --> 19:38.114
I'm gonna come back in.

19:38.114 --> 19:41.420
I'm gonna give you
a $400,000 loan

19:41.420 --> 19:42.823
for just 5% of the business,

19:42.823 --> 19:45.028
as long as you pay me
8% in interest,

19:45.028 --> 19:47.299
because I think
you're underselling yourself.

19:47.299 --> 19:48.868
I'm gonna help you
structure your company

19:48.868 --> 19:50.105
and convince you
in one week flat

19:50.105 --> 19:51.574
you don't need help.

19:53.611 --> 19:55.782
I want you, Ashley and Brittany,
I want you to understand,

19:55.782 --> 19:58.354
before I approached Lori
about partnering with me,

19:58.354 --> 20:01.660
I was gonna give you
$400,000 for 10%.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.299
I don't want to roll
under the bus

20:04.299 --> 20:05.301
or whatever the thing is,
and cut her off ‐‐

20:05.301 --> 20:07.305
"Throw her under the bus,"
it's called.

20:07.305 --> 20:10.445
I sincerely think
that her and I, for 20%,

20:10.445 --> 20:12.649
will help you more
than me for 10%.

20:12.649 --> 20:15.188
I love your business, okay?
But I feel in my heart

20:15.188 --> 20:18.194
that she and I together
are worth the 20%.

20:18.194 --> 20:19.463
Time to make a decision.

20:20.565 --> 20:23.137
Okay, one last twist.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.973
Just 'cause I want to
screw around with them.

20:24.973 --> 20:26.811
No more twists.
No, no, no.

20:26.811 --> 20:29.750
I want to modify
my offer to this ‐‐
No more twists.

20:29.750 --> 20:33.090
I will do it for 3% equity

20:33.090 --> 20:36.096
with a straight royalty
of $6 a kit.

20:36.096 --> 20:38.634
Oh, my God.

20:38.634 --> 20:41.207
I mean, think about that,
because you can afford it.
Wow.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.209
Your margins are crazy.

20:42.209 --> 20:43.611
Barb's is the better deal.

20:43.611 --> 20:45.048
Or no deal at all.

20:45.048 --> 20:46.750
You want to know something?
The only deal

20:46.750 --> 20:48.054
that's right for you...
Okay, let them make
a decision, Lori.

20:48.054 --> 20:50.058
...is the one that you
feel in the gut is right.

20:50.058 --> 20:51.794
You've got multiple offers.
What do you want to do?
You've got to make
a call, guys.

20:51.794 --> 20:53.931
You've got to decide.
Any of them can help you.

20:55.902 --> 20:57.939
Yep.

20:57.939 --> 21:00.912
Would you guys be willing
to do 15%?

21:01.914 --> 21:03.584
For the two of them?
For the two of them.

21:03.584 --> 21:04.786
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

21:10.298 --> 21:12.536
You got a deal.
Awesome!
Yay!

21:14.006 --> 21:15.708
Thank y'all,
each of you.
Pleasure.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.977
Thank you guys.
We really appreciate it.

21:16.977 --> 21:19.283
‐You guys are amazing.
‐Thank you so much!

21:19.283 --> 21:21.387
You are just the kind of women
I love.

21:21.387 --> 21:23.157
‐Thank you.
‐We really appreciate y'all.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.560
‐I'm so excited.
‐Thank you so much.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.728
You guys are amazing.

21:25.728 --> 21:27.699
But the most important part
of the day ‐‐

21:27.699 --> 21:30.071
Look at what you did!
Wow!

21:30.071 --> 21:31.173
You just did that?!

21:31.173 --> 21:32.576
Your kids are gonna be
so proud.

21:32.576 --> 21:33.978
Oh, my God, Mark,
who knew?

21:33.978 --> 21:35.648
Look at that!

21:40.391 --> 21:43.531
I just want to show our kids
what hard work looks like.

21:43.531 --> 21:44.933
And that you can do it,

21:44.933 --> 21:46.503
despite what anybody
says you can do.
Yeah, that's right.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.148
In Season 7,
Sean, Ryan, and Jeff

21:52.148 --> 21:54.519
made a deal with Mark Cuban
for Dude Wipes ‐‐

21:54.519 --> 21:56.290
wet wipes for men.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.628
And they combat stink
for all dude regions.

21:58.628 --> 22:01.300
Let's see
what they're up to now.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.604
We started Dude Products
with our own investment,

22:03.604 --> 22:05.408
and we didn't know
if it would stay afloat

22:05.408 --> 22:06.410
or go down the drain.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.512
Before "Shark Tank,"

22:07.512 --> 22:09.783
we were generating
$5,000 per week.

22:09.783 --> 22:13.491
Today, we're generating
$1.4 million per week.

22:13.491 --> 22:16.630
Our total gross sales
was only $300,000.

22:16.630 --> 22:21.607
Dude Products now has a total
of $120 million in sales.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.411
We started with
a 300‐square‐foot

22:23.411 --> 22:24.546
spare bedroom.

22:24.546 --> 22:27.719
Now we have over 200,000
square feet of warehouse

22:27.719 --> 22:29.623
that houses
5,000 pallets.

22:29.623 --> 22:30.992
Today, we're distributed

22:30.992 --> 22:33.330
in over 15,000 retail stores
nationwide,

22:33.330 --> 22:36.537
including Walmart,
Kroger, Target, and Amazon.

22:36.537 --> 22:38.841
You guys are taking on
some heavy hitters

22:38.841 --> 22:40.511
and changing the game.

22:40.511 --> 22:41.914
One of the reasons
that Dude Wipes

22:41.914 --> 22:43.684
has become
one of my better investments

22:43.684 --> 22:47.392
is that they're literally taking
a category ‐‐ toilet paper ‐‐

22:47.392 --> 22:49.429
and reinventing it
and growing it

22:49.429 --> 22:52.135
and taking market share,
and that's not easy to do.

22:52.135 --> 22:53.871
It really takes somebody
who eats, breathes,

22:53.871 --> 22:55.141
and sleeps their business,

22:55.141 --> 22:57.245
and that's exactly
what they do at Dude Wipes.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.581
You're just shaking up
an industry,

22:58.581 --> 23:00.918
so keep on being you,
and it'll happen.

23:00.918 --> 23:02.288
Alright,
you guys are throwing?

23:04.059 --> 23:06.163
What started as a way
to have fun as friends

23:06.163 --> 23:08.834
has turned into a
multimillion‐dollar enterprise,

23:08.834 --> 23:11.073
and our butt wipes
are even saving lives.

23:11.073 --> 23:13.778
We're working with a great
organization called Fight CRC,

23:13.778 --> 23:16.784
who raises awareness and dollars
for colorectal cancer.

23:16.784 --> 23:19.122
We do monthly blogs
to help raise awareness

23:19.122 --> 23:22.128
and provide them with products
and monetary donations, too.

23:23.030 --> 23:25.935
We're currently the #2
wipes brand in the US,

23:25.935 --> 23:27.572
and as much as we love
that number,

23:27.572 --> 23:29.276
we definitely want to be #1,

23:29.276 --> 23:33.083
and then the next step will be
to take Dude Products worldwide.

23:46.954 --> 23:50.695
Next up is skin care
taken to the next level.

23:58.443 --> 23:59.646
Hi, Sharks.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.817
My name is Lynda,
and I'm the "L" in "Love."

24:01.817 --> 24:04.054
And I'm her husband Paul,
the "P" in "Pebble."

24:04.054 --> 24:05.758
And we're here
from Atlanta, Georgia,

24:05.758 --> 24:10.200
seeking $150,000 for
10% equity of our company ‐‐

24:10.200 --> 24:12.271
Love & Pebble!
Love & Pebble!

24:12.271 --> 24:15.443
Sharks, what if I told you
what we created

24:15.443 --> 24:17.815
was a game‐changer
in the beauty industry?

24:17.815 --> 24:20.387
Are you ready for
the best skincare hack?

24:20.387 --> 24:22.090
Don't worry,
Mr. Wonderful.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.295
We'll let you in on
the best‐kept secret ‐‐

24:24.295 --> 24:25.765
The Beauty Pops!
The Beauty Pops!

24:26.800 --> 24:28.169
It looks like
a lollipop, right?

24:28.169 --> 24:29.706
But it's not
for your mouth, Sharks.

24:29.706 --> 24:31.944
It's actually an ancient
skincare remedy

24:31.944 --> 24:33.212
called skin icing

24:33.212 --> 24:35.383
that's used
to de‐puff your face.

24:35.383 --> 24:39.024
We've combined cryotherapy
with a skin‐loving face mask

24:39.024 --> 24:42.899
to produce our cool, innovative,
one‐of‐a‐kind Beauty Pops.

24:42.899 --> 24:45.036
It helps soothe
your succulent skin

24:45.036 --> 24:47.407
and melts into
a nourishing face mask

24:47.407 --> 24:49.679
that leaves you with
a fresh, wake‐me‐up glow.

24:49.679 --> 24:52.217
Our pops are made from
all‐natural superfoods

24:52.217 --> 24:54.154
rich in antioxidants

24:54.154 --> 24:56.559
to help tighten and brighten
your skin

24:56.559 --> 24:58.329
to help experience
that facial spa

24:58.329 --> 24:59.899
in the comfort of
your home.

24:59.899 --> 25:03.072
All you have to do is pour our
nutrient‐dense facial powder

25:03.072 --> 25:04.943
into our molds..

25:04.943 --> 25:08.684
Pour water,
and then stir until combined.

25:08.684 --> 25:10.955
Place the sticks over them,
and pop them in the freezer

25:10.955 --> 25:12.725
for four hours to set.

25:12.725 --> 25:15.130
And when you're ready
to get your facial on,

25:15.130 --> 25:18.536
you take the Beauty Pops
out of the freezer.

25:18.536 --> 25:19.538
Ta‐da! Ta‐da!

25:20.641 --> 25:22.044
Peel back
the silicone mold,

25:22.044 --> 25:24.181
and you get
super cute Beauty Pops.

25:24.181 --> 25:26.987
And get ready to glow up,
just like she did.

25:26.987 --> 25:29.358
So who wants to chill
with the cool kids

25:29.358 --> 25:31.028
and make some
cold, hard cash?

25:31.028 --> 25:32.631
What happens if I eat this?

25:32.631 --> 25:34.068
Yeah, is it edible?

25:34.068 --> 25:35.236
It is edible.

25:35.236 --> 25:37.307
Oh, wow. Now you're talking
my kind of deal.

25:37.307 --> 25:42.050
Yeah, because it's got bananas,
aloe vera, papaya, and turmeric.

25:42.050 --> 25:44.154
Yes.
Oh, maybe not.

25:44.154 --> 25:45.490
Maybe not.

25:45.490 --> 25:47.594
But basically, this is
a concoction

25:47.594 --> 25:50.066
of fruit frozen, right?
Yes.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.870
And so is the benefit
just the fact

25:51.870 --> 25:54.141
that I'm putting something cold
to my skin?

25:54.141 --> 25:56.078
Could I get that benefit
with just water?

25:56.078 --> 25:58.382
No, icing the skin
helps de‐puff,

25:58.382 --> 26:00.420
so you get
the cryotherapy benefits,

26:00.420 --> 26:03.059
and then you are left
with a nourishing face mask.

26:03.059 --> 26:05.396
So, there's ice rollers
on the market, right?

26:05.396 --> 26:07.501
It's a really popular
skin tool.

26:07.501 --> 26:09.037
And there's face masks.

26:09.037 --> 26:10.808
We're the first
to combine the two.

26:10.808 --> 26:12.745
How did you come up
with this idea?

26:12.745 --> 26:14.214
I'm actually
a pharmacist.

26:14.214 --> 26:17.922
I did use some of my expertise
to help kind of formulate this.

26:17.922 --> 26:19.993
Lynda does a lot of
DIY stuff at home.

26:19.993 --> 26:21.663
And one day, I looked over,

26:21.663 --> 26:23.834
and she was rubbing
a frozen banana on her face.

26:25.403 --> 26:26.873
And I was like,
"What are you doing?"

26:26.873 --> 26:28.677
And she's like,
"No, this really works."

26:28.677 --> 26:30.480
So she had
tried it on me,

26:30.480 --> 26:33.085
and my skin was instantly
soft and smooth.

26:33.085 --> 26:34.856
And so we spent about
a year and a half to two years

26:34.856 --> 26:36.893
trying to formulate something
that we could scale,

26:36.893 --> 26:38.396
'cause you can't ship out
a frozen banana.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.068
Well, you have
beautiful skin.

26:41.068 --> 26:44.341
So, I actually struggled
from acne as a teenager,

26:44.341 --> 26:47.080
and I was really self‐conscious
about my skin.
You'd never know it.

26:47.080 --> 26:48.549
Yeah, and honestly,
you know,

26:48.549 --> 26:50.286
we didn't have very much
growing up

26:50.286 --> 26:52.224
and we couldn't afford
skincare,

26:52.224 --> 26:55.998
so I would go into the kitchen
and I would apply, like,

26:55.998 --> 26:58.135
honey and yogurt on my face

26:58.135 --> 27:01.242
because, you know, all girls
want to feel beautiful.

27:01.242 --> 27:03.112
Did you make
a profession of that

27:03.112 --> 27:04.782
after you did it at home?

27:04.782 --> 27:07.688
No, I started my
entrepreneurial journey at 21,

27:07.688 --> 27:09.424
and I had
a clothing boutique.

27:09.424 --> 27:12.631
I met Paul, and...
You're married?

27:12.631 --> 27:14.201
We're married now,
yeah.

27:14.201 --> 27:16.038
This whole company,
you know,

27:16.038 --> 27:18.710
the whole story behind it
is inspired by penguins.

27:18.710 --> 27:20.280
So, penguins in the wild,

27:20.280 --> 27:22.117
when they find
the perfect pebble, right,

27:22.117 --> 27:23.586
they give it
to their mate.

27:23.586 --> 27:24.923
And if she accepts it,

27:24.923 --> 27:27.260
then, you know,
they mate for life.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.964
And so this company,
Love & Pebble,

27:28.964 --> 27:30.199
is actually
my pebble to her.

27:30.199 --> 27:31.568
‐Aww.
‐Aww.

27:31.568 --> 27:32.738
God, you guys
are killing me.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.174
Love & Pebble.
There you go.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.078
‐Lynda and Paul.
‐This is too sweet.

27:36.078 --> 27:38.684
Let's fall in love
with the numbers, okay?
Yeah.

27:38.684 --> 27:42.290
If you put a value on this
business of $1.5 million,

27:42.290 --> 27:43.894
what are sales like?

27:43.894 --> 27:46.866
So, lifetime sales,
we're at $890,000.

27:46.866 --> 27:47.868
Wow.

27:47.868 --> 27:49.237
How many years is that?

27:49.237 --> 27:51.241
We actually just launched
this product in March.

27:51.241 --> 27:55.249
In May, we sold over $100,000
in four days.

27:55.249 --> 27:56.352
How? What happened?

27:56.352 --> 27:58.122
On TikTok,
it went viral.

27:58.122 --> 27:59.424
Yeah.
Wow.

27:59.424 --> 28:01.963
And I posted a video of
my mom's before and after,

28:01.963 --> 28:04.836
and people fell in love
with her transformation.

28:04.836 --> 28:06.372
Yeah, no kidding.
Yeah.

28:06.372 --> 28:08.376
We had
over 4 million views,

28:08.376 --> 28:10.446
and the sales
were coming in.

28:10.446 --> 28:11.916
Yeah.
So it was incredible.

28:11.916 --> 28:13.085
‐Wow.
‐Okay.

28:13.085 --> 28:14.756
What does it cost,
and what do you sell it for?

28:14.756 --> 28:18.129
So, $9.20 landed,
and we sell it for $46.

28:18.129 --> 28:19.364
‐Wow.
‐That's a good margin.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.701
Yeah.
80% margin, yeah.

28:20.701 --> 28:22.638
How have you financed
the company to date?

28:22.638 --> 28:24.642
We've self‐funded.
She sold her house,

28:24.642 --> 28:25.811
and we put
everything into it.
Oh.

28:25.811 --> 28:27.882
Yeah, I went all‐in.
You sold your house?

28:27.882 --> 28:28.884
‐Yes.
‐Good for you.

28:28.884 --> 28:30.153
And how much is that?

28:30.153 --> 28:31.388
That was $100,000.

28:31.388 --> 28:32.925
Wow.
You are all in.

28:32.925 --> 28:33.927
Yeah.
I am.

28:33.927 --> 28:35.196
So, I get the social media hits.

28:35.196 --> 28:36.298
I get the viral stuff.

28:36.298 --> 28:38.035
But that doesn't happen forever.

28:38.035 --> 28:39.604
Have you done
any digital spend yet?

28:39.604 --> 28:41.575
Have you actually bought
social media?

28:41.575 --> 28:43.747
Yes.
We have.
We do paid marketing.

28:43.747 --> 28:45.984
And what are your
customer acquisition costs?

28:45.984 --> 28:48.389
So, I mean, blended,
we're at $7.

28:48.389 --> 28:50.861
And what's the margin
on the lowest base kit?

28:50.861 --> 28:51.863
80%.

28:51.863 --> 28:53.132
What are you looking for

28:53.132 --> 28:54.735
in getting a Shark
to invest today?

28:54.735 --> 28:56.138
So we're really looking
for a Shark

28:56.138 --> 28:58.275
to help us navigate
the retail space.

28:58.275 --> 29:00.814
I think that this product
would do really well.

29:00.814 --> 29:01.883
Be careful
with all that.

29:01.883 --> 29:03.619
It's really easy
to get caught up.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.757
You guys have got something
that works for you.

29:05.757 --> 29:07.627
Social media, right now,

29:07.627 --> 29:09.866
is an unsung hero
in selling products.

29:09.866 --> 29:10.968
You should use it.

29:10.968 --> 29:12.370
Don't get caught up
in just trying to

29:12.370 --> 29:14.241
search for sales
everywhere.

29:14.241 --> 29:16.345
Look, guys, I have
this great, natural skin.

29:16.345 --> 29:18.783
I don't need a lot of products.
It's just not for me.

29:18.783 --> 29:19.986
Maintenance.
Maintenance.

29:19.986 --> 29:21.789
Nah, come on, it's not
a great fit for me.

29:21.789 --> 29:23.359
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

29:23.359 --> 29:25.263
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

29:25.263 --> 29:28.302
Guys, this just isn't for me,
as a product.

29:28.302 --> 29:29.604
I'm sorry, I'm out.

29:31.008 --> 29:33.612
Paul and Lynda, I think
it's very well‐executed.

29:33.612 --> 29:36.251
I thought about it,
because I like you guys a ton

29:36.251 --> 29:37.721
and I like your product,
but it's just not ‐‐

29:37.721 --> 29:39.892
I don't have any expertise
in this space,

29:39.892 --> 29:41.696
so I'm sorry, I'm out.

29:42.831 --> 29:44.267
So I just wanted to say,

29:44.267 --> 29:46.104
we're working on
a patent right now.

29:46.104 --> 29:48.576
So, you know, there's something
special here, and I...

29:48.576 --> 29:51.315
What's the patent pending on,
freezing fruit into a pop?

29:51.315 --> 29:53.385
Freezing and melting
into a mask.

29:53.385 --> 29:54.655
It's a growing market.

29:54.655 --> 29:56.592
We would love
to have you on board.

29:56.592 --> 29:58.797
I'm just in love
with both of you,

29:58.797 --> 30:00.901
and as much
as I adore you guys,

30:00.901 --> 30:03.673
I've got to say this, though,
I have to be...

30:03.673 --> 30:06.980
We have a meeting
with QVC.
...go with what I think
is true.

30:06.980 --> 30:09.986
And I think that you
should grow slow

30:09.986 --> 30:12.023
so that you don't make
the one big mistake

30:12.023 --> 30:13.727
that happens
to entrepreneurs,

30:13.727 --> 30:16.365
which sometimes
can be exploding too much

30:16.365 --> 30:19.672
and having too much inventory
before you have the sales.

30:19.672 --> 30:22.043
I think you're on
the right path.

30:22.043 --> 30:23.713
It's not the right product
for me.

30:23.713 --> 30:26.084
So I love you,
but I'm gonna go out.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.188
Okay.

30:28.188 --> 30:31.361
Paul and Lynda,
it's not all over yet.

30:31.361 --> 30:32.665
Barbara?

30:32.665 --> 30:35.737
I wonder if the social media
success you have

30:35.737 --> 30:37.140
is a one‐hit wonder,

30:37.140 --> 30:40.212
because it's responsible for the
great majority of your sales,

30:40.212 --> 30:41.716
and that concerns me.

30:41.716 --> 30:43.987
I mistrust the retail space.

30:43.987 --> 30:45.423
Something about
a young entrepreneur,

30:45.423 --> 30:46.525
when they think retail,

30:46.525 --> 30:48.295
they don't think
about slotting fees.

30:48.295 --> 30:49.899
They don't think
about return product.

30:49.899 --> 30:51.001
They don't feel ‐‐
Exactly.

30:51.001 --> 30:53.138
So much goes wrong.
Mm‐hmm.

30:53.138 --> 30:55.777
And that's the kind of guidance
we need, so...

30:55.777 --> 30:58.148
Yeah, so I'm thinking.
I mean, this is a rough one.

30:59.484 --> 31:01.823
Barbara, please.
My Beauty Pop is melting.

31:01.823 --> 31:05.262
I think this is
a wonderful business

31:05.262 --> 31:07.367
that you've created,

31:07.367 --> 31:09.839
but I don't think
it's a business for an investor.

31:11.007 --> 31:12.243
I'm out.

31:12.243 --> 31:13.713
I'm sorry for that, though.

31:13.713 --> 31:15.751
I really wanted to find my way.

31:16.986 --> 31:18.589
Okay.
Is everyone out?

31:18.589 --> 31:20.426
Good luck, guys.
All the best.
Thank you.

31:20.426 --> 31:21.561
Good luck.
Good luck, guys.

31:21.561 --> 31:23.365
Thank you.
Bye.

31:31.983 --> 31:33.185
I keep working
and I keep working,

31:33.185 --> 31:36.091
and I know one day,
we're gonna succeed.

31:36.091 --> 31:37.694
We've already started
seeing it this year.

31:37.694 --> 31:40.366
And, you know,
we've seen this growth,

31:40.366 --> 31:41.568
and we're just
gonna keep going.

31:52.791 --> 31:54.060
Next in the Tank

31:54.060 --> 31:56.631
is a family who turned a hobby
into a business.

31:57.935 --> 31:59.070
Aww.

32:06.384 --> 32:08.455
Hi, Sharks.
I'm Zach.
I'm Zoe.

32:08.455 --> 32:10.092
I'm Kam.
And I'm Summer.

32:10.092 --> 32:12.430
And we're the founders
of Zach & Zoe Sweet Bee Farm,

32:12.430 --> 32:15.871
and we're looking for
$150,000 for 10% in equity.

32:15.871 --> 32:19.043
Did you know that most of
the honey that you see in stores

32:19.043 --> 32:20.714
has actually
been processed?

32:20.714 --> 32:22.818
All of that processing
takes away the good stuff.

32:22.818 --> 32:25.189
Some even add in
sugar and corn syrup.

32:25.189 --> 32:26.291
Zach & Zoe Sweet Bee Farm

32:26.291 --> 32:28.128
is taking the sweetener industry
by storm

32:28.128 --> 32:30.332
by changing the way
people view bees and honey

32:30.332 --> 32:32.671
by creating a delicious twist
on raw unfiltered honey.

32:32.671 --> 32:36.177
No pesticides. No additives.
Just pure, raw honey

32:36.177 --> 32:38.415
From ginger
to matcha to beetroot,

32:38.415 --> 32:40.486
we take raw honey
and blend it with superfoods,

32:40.486 --> 32:42.390
all in‐house,
no co‐packer.

32:42.390 --> 32:44.227
We started this company
by accident.

32:44.227 --> 32:45.964
Five years ago,
we were looking for

32:45.964 --> 32:48.670
a way to solve
our son's allergies,

32:48.670 --> 32:52.009
and when we found raw honey,
it was a game changer for Zach,

32:52.009 --> 32:53.813
because it actually
contains pollen,

32:53.813 --> 32:56.051
which has a variety
of health benefits.

32:56.051 --> 32:58.622
And we don't just sell
our honey, we farm it ourselves.

32:58.622 --> 33:01.494
We started out with a few hives
and grew it to a full facility

33:01.494 --> 33:03.131
that our whole family
cares for.

33:03.131 --> 33:05.402
The quality of our honey
and the health of our bees

33:05.402 --> 33:06.538
is so important to us.

33:06.538 --> 33:08.241
So, Sharks,
who wants to continue the buzz

33:08.241 --> 33:10.245
and join our hive
of busy bees?

33:11.581 --> 33:13.285
So is this all your honeys?

33:13.285 --> 33:15.356
Did you make all these varieties
right here in front of us?

33:15.356 --> 33:18.730
We do. We make all
of our honey in‐house

33:18.730 --> 33:21.167
in a facility
in Lebanon, New Jersey,

33:21.167 --> 33:24.107
and we take care
of 50 hives ourselves.

33:24.107 --> 33:26.611
And we actually source
a lot of our honey,

33:26.611 --> 33:30.654
about 80%, from local farms
right by our doorstep.

33:30.654 --> 33:32.623
How did you become
bee farmers?

33:32.623 --> 33:35.062
Zachary had
horrible allergies.

33:35.062 --> 33:36.966
He was in and out
of the hospital.
Yep.

33:36.966 --> 33:39.237
We started
keeping bees for him.

33:39.237 --> 33:41.207
It was a hobby
for my husband.
Yep.

33:41.207 --> 33:44.414
So we were able to
treat Zachary within a year,

33:44.414 --> 33:46.886
and we saw that
one spring went by,

33:46.886 --> 33:48.923
the next went by,
and here he was

33:48.923 --> 33:52.196
with no symptoms
of allergy‐induced asthma.

33:52.196 --> 33:53.766
I think you should tell us
what we're eating,

33:53.766 --> 33:55.402
'cause we're
already chowing it down.

33:55.402 --> 33:57.506
I wanted to add
an extra flair to the honey,

33:57.506 --> 34:00.747
so I began to add organic
superfoods into the honey ‐‐

34:00.747 --> 34:03.318
beetroot, ginger, matcha.
Matcha.

34:03.318 --> 34:04.655
Blueberry is, like, phenomenal.

34:04.655 --> 34:06.591
That's great.
Thanks, Mark.
Oh, thanks!

34:06.591 --> 34:07.828
I think I've seen this.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.898
Has this been
in restaurants or ‐‐
It has.

34:09.898 --> 34:11.468
It is, okay.
Yep, so, you know,

34:11.468 --> 34:13.538
our wholesale accounts,
we're working with ‐‐

34:13.538 --> 34:16.077
Macy's has picked this up,
Bloomingdale's.

34:16.077 --> 34:17.513
We've had a lot of press.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.983
We've been in
<i>New York Times.</i>

34:18.983 --> 34:22.389
2018,
our sales were $62,000.

34:22.389 --> 34:24.995
2019 ‐‐ $135,000.

34:24.995 --> 34:27.500
In 2020, $401,000.
Wow.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.537
And in 2021,
we're already at $888,000.

34:29.537 --> 34:32.143
Yeah, baby. Yeah!
Oh, now you're talking.

34:32.143 --> 34:34.413
Wow!
You said you're already
at $800,000.

34:34.413 --> 34:36.417
Yep.
Okay, so break that down

34:36.417 --> 34:40.359
between wholesale, retail,
and direct to consumer.
Yep.

34:40.359 --> 34:42.664
Pre‐pandemic,
70% of our business

34:42.664 --> 34:45.269
was Chelsea Market right
in New York, retail traffic.

34:45.269 --> 34:47.072
And then during the pandemic,
we had to pivot

34:47.072 --> 34:48.608
and really invest
in our website

34:48.608 --> 34:50.078
and direct to consumer.
'Cause everything switched.

34:50.078 --> 34:52.249
Of course, yeah.
And so right now,
we do 70% of our business

34:52.249 --> 34:54.453
direct to consumer
right from our site.
Website.

34:54.453 --> 34:55.924
And we're not
advertising.

34:55.924 --> 34:57.159
Okay, what does
one of these cost,

34:57.159 --> 34:58.361
and what does it
cost you to make?

34:58.361 --> 35:01.234
Our 16‐ounce jar,
we make it for $6.

35:01.234 --> 35:04.207
It wholesales for $13,
and it retails for $20.
That size.

35:04.207 --> 35:05.810
How do your prices compare

35:05.810 --> 35:07.479
to the other honey makers
out there?

35:07.479 --> 35:09.183
They're a little more.

35:09.183 --> 35:12.423
By what percent, would you say?
Other honey makers
are about $15 per ‐‐

35:12.423 --> 35:16.231
16 ounce.
Yeah, 12 or 16 ounces
when you look them up.

35:16.231 --> 35:19.303
But there's nothing else
in it.
So you're charging
about a 25% premium.

35:19.303 --> 35:22.343
Yeah.
Because of the organic
superfoods from the best farms.

35:22.343 --> 35:25.917
We just got accepted to Target's
2021 incubator program.

35:25.917 --> 35:28.121
We're gonna do
$1.5 million this year,

35:28.121 --> 35:29.658
we think, pretty easily.

35:29.658 --> 35:31.862
What's going to
accelerate you to that?
Target's a big one.

35:31.862 --> 35:33.231
So how are you gonna be able
to deal with that?

35:33.231 --> 35:36.237
Because going from
$880,000 a year

35:36.237 --> 35:38.876
to having one
really big customer

35:38.876 --> 35:40.747
takes a real commitment
in cash.
Yeah.

35:40.747 --> 35:42.082
Are you profitable,
first of all?

35:42.082 --> 35:44.888
Yes. Yeah. 23% margins.
23% net income.
23% margins.

35:44.888 --> 35:48.128
- So you're making about 200
- K
so far this year, right?
Correct.

35:48.128 --> 35:49.798
You know, in my industry,

35:49.798 --> 35:52.837
we buy enormous amounts
of honey.

35:52.837 --> 35:55.509
There's a huge problem
with bee colony collapse,

35:55.509 --> 35:57.681
where huge groups of bees
have died.
We're seeing that.
We're seeing that.

35:57.681 --> 35:59.183
Yeah, we've had a problem
with that, for real.

35:59.183 --> 36:01.722
And bees are
the number‐one pollinator.

36:01.722 --> 36:05.495
If we lose our bees,
vegetable crops, fruits,

36:05.495 --> 36:07.433
we're gonna be
in huge trouble.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.738
Tell us a little bit
about how you see your role

36:09.738 --> 36:11.574
in that ecosystem,

36:11.574 --> 36:13.111
and do you have a strategy
related to that?

36:13.111 --> 36:14.748
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know,
us having bees

36:14.748 --> 36:16.117
is a differentiator,
right?

36:16.117 --> 36:18.856
We've got 50 hives
on our property in New Jersey,

36:18.856 --> 36:22.529
and so we do a lot of talks
around beekeeping, bee health.

36:22.529 --> 36:24.433
So this is so much more
than a company.

36:24.433 --> 36:26.237
It's like a mission.
Yeah.

36:26.237 --> 36:28.776
I want to ask Zach
a question.

36:28.776 --> 36:32.583
Bees, they work very hard
to make this honey

36:32.583 --> 36:34.053
so they can eat it.

36:34.053 --> 36:36.224
You go in there and rip it off
and sell it.

36:38.561 --> 36:41.467
They don't even get
a royalty or anything.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.806
They don't have any equity
in your business.
They don't.

36:43.806 --> 36:45.175
How do you feel
about that?

36:45.175 --> 36:46.477
Every beekeeper,
kind of as a rule,

36:46.477 --> 36:47.814
they don't take
a certain amount.

36:47.814 --> 36:49.583
Like, they don't take ‐‐
never take too much honey.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.087
Go, Zach.

36:51.087 --> 36:52.957
I see a future
with you, Zach.

36:54.928 --> 36:57.099
The challenge I see, though,
is in the scaling.

36:57.099 --> 37:00.439
You're trying to just add
your biggest customers right now

37:00.439 --> 37:01.809
early in your life cycle.
Yep.

37:01.809 --> 37:03.545
I think that's gonna be
more difficult

37:03.545 --> 37:05.048
than you're
giving it credit for.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.152
Knowing what I know
about food supply chains...
Yeah.

37:07.152 --> 37:08.656
...it's one thing
to get to $5 million,

37:08.656 --> 37:10.325
which yeah, right?
Yeah.

37:10.325 --> 37:11.862
Another thing
to get to $10 million, yeah.

37:11.862 --> 37:14.801
But now all of a sudden,
the complexity levels change.
Of course.

37:14.801 --> 37:16.137
I don't know that
you're accounting

37:16.137 --> 37:17.272
for the complexity level.

37:17.272 --> 37:20.045
And so for those reasons,
I'm out.

37:20.045 --> 37:24.888
Listen, guys, I'm struggling
to find a role to fit in here

37:24.888 --> 37:28.328
because it really does feel
to me like a family business,

37:28.328 --> 37:30.733
and I think it'd be
uncomfortable for me

37:30.733 --> 37:34.440
to, like, jump in there
at this stage.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.477
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

37:36.477 --> 37:37.680
Thank you, Daniel.
Thank you.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.216
And thank you, Mark.

37:39.216 --> 37:41.989
My biggest struggle
is on the product side,

37:41.989 --> 37:45.061
because I'm a person
who doesn't eat honey.
Oh, wow.

37:45.061 --> 37:46.631
I know that sounds crazy.
Wow. Yeah.

37:46.631 --> 37:48.434
But I actually
really don't.

37:48.434 --> 37:51.708
So sadly, for those reasons,
I am out.

37:51.708 --> 37:53.244
Thank you, Lori.
But I hope that one
of my fellow Sharks is in.

37:53.244 --> 37:54.480
Thank you.
That was so sweet.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.217
That's nice. Thank you.
Thank you.

37:56.217 --> 37:59.256
You guys
remind me so much ‐‐

37:59.256 --> 38:02.062
in fact, identical ‐‐
to Wicked Good Cupcakes.

38:02.062 --> 38:05.770
It was a family business, 'cause
it was always for their kids.

38:05.770 --> 38:08.676
And when they did sell it
recently to Hickory Farms,

38:08.676 --> 38:10.178
everybody made
millions of dollars.
Wow.

38:10.178 --> 38:13.017
They were just like you.
I like this deal.

38:13.017 --> 38:15.455
I'm gonna make you
the exact same offer

38:15.455 --> 38:17.292
I made them nine years ago

38:17.292 --> 38:19.163
when they were
standing right there.

38:19.163 --> 38:20.599
Zero equity.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.937
You have enough margin
in the larger jars

38:22.937 --> 38:24.741
to pay me a dollar royalty

38:24.741 --> 38:26.778
against the $150,000
I'll give you.
I knew you were gonna say that.

38:26.778 --> 38:28.214
Shocking, right?

38:28.214 --> 38:30.920
After I recoup
the $150,000,

38:30.920 --> 38:32.690
it drops down
to 25 cents.

38:32.690 --> 38:34.661
That's the identical deal.

38:34.661 --> 38:36.698
And then we work together
to blow up sales,

38:36.698 --> 38:38.401
as I did
with Wicked Good Cupcakes.

38:38.401 --> 38:41.040
We ended up with commercial
kitchens all over the country.
Yeah.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.077
And we blew it up because
we were both incentivized.

38:43.077 --> 38:46.350
I never took equity,
and when it got sold,

38:46.350 --> 38:47.519
I did well, too.

38:47.519 --> 38:49.323
Everybody made money.

38:49.323 --> 38:51.360
I don't think there's room
for equity, because in the end,

38:51.360 --> 38:52.997
this deal's for your kids.

38:54.801 --> 38:56.638
Hold on, guys.
I have an offer.

39:08.294 --> 39:10.065
Three Sharks are out.

39:10.065 --> 39:13.037
The Johnson family has an offer
on the table from Kevin

39:13.037 --> 39:16.544
for their honey company,
Zach & Zoe Sweet Bee Farm,

39:16.544 --> 39:19.083
but Barbara
also seems interested.

39:19.083 --> 39:20.853
Hold on, guys.
I have an offer.

39:23.892 --> 39:28.000
My dream entrepreneur
is when they remind me of me,

39:28.000 --> 39:31.107
like somebody who started with
nothing that made a little magic

39:31.107 --> 39:33.311
and stayed on course
and built an empire.

39:33.311 --> 39:35.315
So you might not think
you're sitting on an empire,

39:35.315 --> 39:38.689
but I can see as clear
as I could see tomorrow.

39:38.689 --> 39:42.697
Alright, so I'm gonna make you
probably a juicier offer

39:42.697 --> 39:46.170
than you were looking for,
but I need to have more equity.

39:46.170 --> 39:51.046
So I'm gonna
give you $200,000 for 20%.

39:51.046 --> 39:55.422
Alright, but I am excellent
at strategy on building brand.

39:55.422 --> 39:56.725
I'm an excellent marketer.

39:56.725 --> 39:58.127
I don't have to
sell you on that

39:58.127 --> 40:02.002
because I have proven it
with so many of my brands.

40:05.475 --> 40:08.014
$200,000 for 20%.
Mr. Wonderful ‐‐

40:08.014 --> 40:10.351
Zero equity, because
you're a family business.

40:10.351 --> 40:13.424
Kam, are you evaluating
his royalty deal?

40:13.424 --> 40:16.464
So he's going to
get paid back.
You understand
you're adding like 13%

40:16.464 --> 40:19.002
every single jar you sell
at the beginning.

40:19.002 --> 40:21.808
13% weight like shackles.
You know why I'm coming over?

40:21.808 --> 40:24.613
'Cause you're wearing yellow.
Because things can sometimes
be so obvious.

40:24.613 --> 40:27.619
Let's show Kevin
what's happening here.

40:28.789 --> 40:30.960
He's not impressed.
Who fits in?

40:30.960 --> 40:34.366
He never wears
anything but black.
Barbara, I have no interest
in doing a deal with you in it.

40:34.366 --> 40:35.635
Well, it's a simple question.

40:35.635 --> 40:37.439
Do you want to part
with 20% of your equity?

40:37.439 --> 40:39.309
Can we huddle?
Can we huddle?
We need to huddle.

40:39.309 --> 40:40.779
Okay, we can huddle.
Go ahead.

40:40.779 --> 40:44.219
You understand
both offers, right?

40:44.219 --> 40:45.656
Yes, absolutely.
Yep.

40:45.656 --> 40:47.693
Talk to any
of my partners.

40:47.693 --> 40:49.664
I'm a different cut of cloth
than Kevin.

40:49.664 --> 40:52.335
Okay, can we huddle in there?
Yeah, we can.

40:52.335 --> 40:54.172
No, but ‐‐

40:54.172 --> 40:56.343
We love it.
Oh, that's so nice.

40:56.343 --> 40:57.947
No, I'll let you huddle
on your own.

40:57.947 --> 40:59.951
Thank you.

40:59.951 --> 41:01.788
20%.

41:01.788 --> 41:04.928
I'll kill you
if you get this deal.

41:04.928 --> 41:08.802
I mean, who's gonna help?
Mr. Wonderful or Barbara, right?

41:09.938 --> 41:11.473
Barbara. Barbara.
I think probably Barbara.

41:11.473 --> 41:12.509
I don't know.

41:12.509 --> 41:14.580
The Wicked Cupcake thing
was brilliant.

41:14.580 --> 41:16.584
What a wholesome family.

41:21.193 --> 41:22.730
Well,
what have you decided?

41:22.730 --> 41:26.570
We came in asking
for $150,000 for 10%.

41:26.570 --> 41:30.111
Barbara, would you be willing
- to consider 200
- K for 12%?

41:32.549 --> 41:33.819
15%, I would.

41:40.098 --> 41:41.835
You got a deal.
There you go.

41:41.835 --> 41:43.304
Great, I didn't have to justify.
Great.

41:43.304 --> 41:44.439
Well done.
Thank you, Kevin.

41:44.439 --> 41:45.909
No problem.
I'm very, very happy.

41:45.909 --> 41:48.247
What proud parents
you should be.
Thank you.

41:48.247 --> 41:50.084
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

41:50.084 --> 41:52.690
Congratulations.
My pleasure.

41:52.690 --> 41:54.026
Thank you.
Can't wait
to get together with you.

41:54.026 --> 41:55.028
Thank you.
Can't wait.
Same.

41:55.028 --> 41:56.096
Congratulations, guys.
Well done.

41:56.096 --> 41:57.532
‐Congrats, guys.
‐Thank you.

42:01.006 --> 42:02.442
Alright, guys.

42:04.413 --> 42:05.949
Nice job.

42:05.949 --> 42:08.054
Excellent job,
everyone.
Yes.

42:08.054 --> 42:10.491
Even though Kevin had that
deal with the cupcake business,

42:10.491 --> 42:13.130
I think Barbara's expertise
is just ‐‐

42:13.130 --> 42:15.903
is more helpful
for us specifically,

42:15.903 --> 42:17.640
and I think
she can really put us

42:17.640 --> 42:19.644
in those
big retail stores,

42:19.644 --> 42:21.246
and I think I'm excited
for the future.

42:21.246 --> 42:22.817
I think we made
the right decision.

42:22.817 --> 42:25.021
Yay!
That's awesome, guys.

42:25.021 --> 42:27.325
‐Mm!
‐Love you guys.
