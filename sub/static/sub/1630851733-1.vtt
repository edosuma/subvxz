02:47.067 --> 02:50.370
I named myself Pythia,
who was the oracle of Apollo.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.672
She was a very powerful
feminine figure

02:52.672 --> 02:53.707
in the ancient times of Greece,

02:53.707 --> 02:54.875
so it's just a way

02:54.875 --> 02:56.977
for me to sort of pay ode
to my Greek roots,

02:56.977 --> 03:00.714
but also channel
my ancestral feminine energy.

pronounce it "PITH-ia,"

07:03.823 --> 07:06.559
What I do have
is versatility--

07:06.559 --> 07:08.528
in drag, not in the bedroom.

07:08.528 --> 07:12.065
I have been doing drag
for 14 years.

-Damn!

08:03.316 --> 08:05.118

08:05.118 --> 08:08.621
My drag is a combination

08:08.621 --> 08:11.591
Beyonc, Britney Spears,
Janet Jackson.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.660
And all of this comes together

08:13.660 --> 08:16.730
to create the persona
that I am today.

08:16.730 --> 08:21.167
Ocane is not known
for being an acrobatic queen.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.737
The only thing I can do
is put my knees behind my head,

It's like the same thing
as applying makeup.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.334
It livens up the dish,
and this is a whole dish, honey.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.404

that I'm a bitch.

I could be kind,
but I can also be a bitch.

Oh, my God.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.595
-Oh!
-What?

09:24.631 --> 09:26.099
Gender is a construct.

09:26.099 --> 09:29.068
The only one that matters
is Kendall.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.670
-What?
-Hi!

Oh, my gosh.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.440
I'm Kendall Gender.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.276
Now, that's Gender,
not Jenner.

Just in case you were expecting

09:37.744 --> 09:39.779
a 5-foot-10 supermodel
to come out,

09:39.779 --> 09:42.582
and you got
a 6-foot tall one instead.

09:42.582 --> 09:46.286
A Kendall Gender signature look
is all about body.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.354
It's all about the boobs,
the corset,

09:48.354 --> 09:51.925
the big pads, hourglass shape.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.027

for jury duty.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.534
It's our civic right.

10:34.534 --> 10:37.103
I want the other queens to know

10:37.103 --> 10:38.938
that I'm not just a pretty face.

10:38.938 --> 10:42.742
I'm fierce, I'm funny,
I'm fashionable.

10:42.742 --> 10:44.777

-Got it.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.030
Oh, my God.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.065
I am gooped, I am gagged,

11:06.065 --> 11:07.967
I am booped, I am bagged.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.870
Okay, clearly--
clearly it's happening.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.906
So have you ever heard
of Brat Pack?

11:12.906 --> 11:13.940
Yes.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.842
This is like
the original Brat Pack.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.377
I love you.
I'm so excited.

11:17.377 --> 11:23.283
The Brat Pack is this little
narcissist
group of queens.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.685
They like to think theirselves

11:25.685 --> 11:27.820
they're so pretty
and they're so talented.

11:27.820 --> 11:31.958
As we know, in Drag Race
herstory, cliques
never work.

11:31.958 --> 11:37.130
So let's hope it doesn't work
for them as well.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.166
[alarm]

11:40.166 --> 11:41.534
Oh, my God!

11:41.534 --> 11:44.070
Aah!

11:44.070 --> 11:46.239
It's happening!

11:49.609 --> 11:52.979
RuPaul: She done already
done had herses.

11:52.979 --> 11:55.415
Peek-a-Ru, I see you.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.318

Hello, hello, hello!

11:58.318 --> 12:00.053
It's Ru-motherfucking-Paul.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.888
She's talking to me right now.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.890
What?

12:03.890 --> 12:07.560
My queens,
welcome to Season 2.

12:07.560 --> 12:11.898
You've got the kind of charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

12:11.898 --> 12:14.867
that can survive
a Canadian winter,

12:14.867 --> 12:18.104
and still pop back
smelling like a rose.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.040
So put your petals
to the metal,

12:21.040 --> 12:24.043
and, please, don't be a prick.

12:24.043 --> 12:26.846
So let your lady garden bloom,

12:26.846 --> 12:31.618
and prove to the world
that, yes, you're that chick.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.122
[cheers and applause]

12:36.122 --> 12:39.092

13:19.465 --> 13:21.200

-Hi!

13:21.200 --> 13:24.437
I'm so excited
to be joining the family.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.372
-Yes!
-Yes!

13:26.372 --> 13:29.876
Well, I'm not
the only surprise today.

Blessed be her fruit.

13:43.890 --> 13:45.258
I absolutely love
Handmaid's Tale.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.026
She's my favorite Martha.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.995
I was very, very, very excited
to see her here.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.198
My queens,
it is so wonderful to be here.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.499
But at the same time,

13:53.499 --> 13:55.802
fuck all of you
for looking so damn good.

13:55.802 --> 13:58.137
-Reowrr!
-Shade!

13:58.137 --> 14:00.273
Now, you have all been selected

14:00.273 --> 14:02.141
because you have
that je ne sais quoi

14:02.141 --> 14:06.312
that makes you true, north,
strong, and fierce.

14:06.312 --> 14:08.181
Over the next several weeks,
one of you

14:08.181 --> 14:12.652
will show us enough charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent

14:12.652 --> 14:16.055

Now, we know you wanna

is being polished,

Suki Doll!

20:55.187 --> 20:57.356
[cheering]

20:57.356 --> 21:02.495
Yes.
♪ Suki, she's gonna give it to
you ♪

21:02.495 --> 21:04.930
Con-drag-ulations, Suki Doll.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.533
You have won
a stunning shoe collection

21:07.533 --> 21:14.073
and $2.500 cash
courtesy of House of Hayla.

21:14.073 --> 21:16.442
[cheering]

21:16.442 --> 21:18.210
It's not that
I needed more shoes.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.346
A girl can always
have more shoes.

21:20.346 --> 21:23.149
He knows. He's a stylist.
[all laugh]

21:23.149 --> 21:25.885
So you ever get a little
too krunk at the club

21:25.885 --> 21:27.319
and end up leaving
something behind?

21:27.319 --> 21:29.455
Maybe your phone or your shoes?

21:29.455 --> 21:31.624
Your dignity?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.559
For this week's maxi-challenge,

21:33.559 --> 21:35.094
we want you to salvage
whatever you can

21:35.094 --> 21:36.195
from these coat check closets

21:36.195 --> 21:40.733
that are filled with
left behind items and clothing.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.768
Using the fabulous
Fabricland wall,

21:42.768 --> 21:45.538
we want you to create
a haute check couture look

21:45.538 --> 21:49.108
that screams
premiere party eleganza.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.177
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

21:51.177 --> 21:52.845
Just to be clear, my dears,

21:52.845 --> 21:55.214
just because
there's clothing in there

21:55.214 --> 22:00.019
doesn't mean you can walk down
the runway
in some basic outfit.

22:00.019 --> 22:03.422
Show us who you are.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.590
-Got it.
-Got it.

22:04.590 --> 22:07.259
Suki Doll, as winner
of the mini-challenge,

22:07.259 --> 22:10.663
you get a 30-second head start
to get your shit together.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.897
Aah!

22:11.897 --> 22:14.233
Go.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.834
-Go!
-Go!

22:15.834 --> 22:18.237
Me first? Aah!

22:18.237 --> 22:20.506
I got 30 seconds extra.

22:20.506 --> 22:21.574
I'm, like,
get the best I can here.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.809
Okay. Oh, my God.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.778
This coat check is a mess.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.346
I'm taking what I can here.

22:27.346 --> 22:32.218
And now, racers,
start your engines,

22:32.218 --> 22:34.887
and may the best drag queen win.

22:34.887 --> 22:37.723
[screaming]

22:37.723 --> 22:40.960
The other girls run in,
they're crazy,

22:40.960 --> 22:43.362
they're ripping stuff,
they look like animals.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.363
Are we at the zoo?

22:44.363 --> 22:45.831
Ooh, girl.

22:45.831 --> 22:47.166
Oh.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.368
Is that a jar of olives?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.471
I see three things that I love.

22:52.471 --> 22:55.307
Napkins. Okay, bitch.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.643
Feathered wings,
and I see a feather boa.

22:57.643 --> 22:59.545
I don't know what
I'm making out of it,

22:59.545 --> 23:01.013
but I'm grabbing them all.

23:01.013 --> 23:03.382
All right, I'm good.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.984
What?

23:04.984 --> 23:07.653
I'm in the coat check.

23:07.653 --> 23:10.623
I feel, like, lost.
Like, I should just grab.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.425
I find myself being
almost a little too picky,

23:13.425 --> 23:14.893
and before I know it,

23:14.893 --> 23:18.264
there's not a whole lot
that I really wanna work with.

23:19.665 --> 23:20.999
Ooh, mama.

23:20.999 --> 23:23.202
-Is it okay if I sit here?
-Yeah.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.471
Oh, you pulled
a lot of good stuff.

23:25.471 --> 23:29.141
-Let's get to it.
-So much color. Aah!

23:29.141 --> 23:32.244
So for this week's
maxi-challenge,

23:32.244 --> 23:38.050
we have to design a premiere
fancy dress party extravaganza.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.185
What is this? Oh. [laughs]

23:40.185 --> 23:42.821
We have to use the items
that are provided,

23:42.821 --> 23:44.657
and they're all crap.

23:44.657 --> 23:48.894
Let's figure this out.

23:48.894 --> 23:49.895
When you think of eleganza,

23:49.895 --> 23:53.232
your mind automatically
goes to an evening gown.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.401
As much as I love
an evening gown,

23:55.401 --> 23:58.103
I'm a little bit more edgy,

23:58.103 --> 23:59.872
and I think a risk
in this competition

23:59.872 --> 24:02.408
is better than to play it safe.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.810
Not ugly.

24:06.412 --> 24:08.981
Wait. Let me see what you got.
I wanna see. I'm curious.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.317
-You see a story in there?
-I do, yes!

24:11.317 --> 24:12.751
I just went for all red.

24:12.751 --> 24:13.986
I love it.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.454
Initially, my idea

24:15.454 --> 24:18.590
was to come up with a wonderful
garment
and everything.

24:18.590 --> 24:23.062
But with my knee hurting,
I'm limping,

24:23.062 --> 24:26.865
I am going to adapt
my situation,

24:26.865 --> 24:28.267
maybe turn it into a comedy.

24:28.267 --> 24:32.738
Yes, I'm gonna make my costume
completely silly.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.740
[laughs]

24:34.740 --> 24:36.842
Child, I'm stressed.

24:36.842 --> 24:39.178
Me fucking too.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.814
I didn't think I'd be worried

24:41.814 --> 24:43.382
about a sewing challenge
coming into this,

24:43.382 --> 24:45.351
but working with
unconventional materials

24:45.351 --> 24:47.353
is definitely new for me.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.421
That's messing with my head
a little bit.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.191
I don't know why my mind's
just blanking right now.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.193
It's normal.
Just take a breath.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.127
I was thinking about

24:55.127 --> 24:58.831
potentially making
a mermaid dress out of this.

25:00.799 --> 25:02.267
I don't think
I'm gonna use these

25:02.267 --> 25:03.936
because I don't want it
to read quinceera.

25:03.936 --> 25:07.673
Beth's explaining to me
her concept, and, oh. Oh, no.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.875
If I were Beth,
I would be scared.

25:12.444 --> 25:14.947
Are you just drawing
a bunch of dicks on your paper?

25:14.947 --> 25:17.015
-Yeah.
-[laughs]

25:17.015 --> 25:21.820
I've decided to cut feathers
out of this poster event.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.356
Oh, no, it's like
these little things

25:24.356 --> 25:25.758
is gonna be glued on a corset.

25:25.758 --> 25:29.361
Are you worried about
doing fabric on a corset,

25:29.361 --> 25:30.696
-you know, because--
-What do you mean?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.798
Queens get read for that
all the time on Drag Race.

25:34.066 --> 25:35.601
Everyone went silent
when you said that.

25:35.601 --> 25:39.471
Well, if it looks good,
they won't get read by it.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.440
Well, sis,
that's a big if. [laughs]

25:41.440 --> 25:42.841
Well...

25:42.841 --> 25:46.545
I really want the judges
to see my vision.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.080
I think I can do it.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.250
I'm gonna make this very
couture,
haute couture,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.952
and we'll see how it turns out.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.254
Yeah, so what's yours?

25:55.254 --> 25:57.289
See, there's only
one thing on my table.

25:57.289 --> 25:58.957
-Uh-huh.
-So it's gonna be dyed.

25:58.957 --> 26:00.893
I'm gonna drape it,

26:00.893 --> 26:04.062
and I'll make it
a structured eleganza, right?

26:04.062 --> 26:08.333
And then under is gonna
be a very Azzedine Alaia body.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.336
It's gonna be draped and biased,
and it's just gonna go flowy.

26:11.336 --> 26:13.739
And then it's gonna cut,
and it's gonna show the skin.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.641
It's gonna be a mesh,
and then it's gonna be metallic.

26:15.641 --> 26:16.708
Okay.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.143
What's the fabric?
I don't know.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.412
[all laugh]

26:20.412 --> 26:22.714
I sewed one dress
for this competition.

26:22.714 --> 26:25.017
Is that the first and only
that you ever sewed?

26:25.017 --> 26:28.287
I mean, a lady never tells.
[all laugh]

26:28.287 --> 26:31.256
I feel really good about
my ability to design an outfit.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.859
I design almost everything
that I wear.

26:33.859 --> 26:36.061
But I'm a little nervous.

26:36.061 --> 26:37.696
In terms of actually
sewing something myself,

26:37.696 --> 26:43.869
I've never actually sewn
a full garment by myself.

26:43.869 --> 26:46.171
I'm looking around the werkroom.

26:46.171 --> 26:49.441
Everyone has
these amazing concepts,

26:49.441 --> 26:52.845
everyone's going for
big statement pieces,

26:52.845 --> 26:56.181
and I'm a little intimidated.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.984
-Icesis?
-Yeah.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.419
How are you feeling
with this challenge?

27:00.419 --> 27:04.656
I'm good. I think I'm gonna do,
like, a full fringe gown,

27:04.656 --> 27:09.294
-with these things that I found.
-No.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.330
Yeah, so I'll make,
like, an under-piece,

27:11.330 --> 27:13.799
and then I'll, like...

27:13.799 --> 27:15.868
That is such a nice idea.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.102
So what are you doing?

27:17.102 --> 27:18.971
I'm very pink in life.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.372
Like, I love pink.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.707
So you're really gay.

27:21.707 --> 27:24.643
-I'm Latina, you know?
-Oh! Same, girl!

27:24.643 --> 27:26.612
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.313
Icesis and I are talking,

27:28.313 --> 27:30.482
and I notice that
we're kind of alike.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.817
We're Latina sisters.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.953
I have a partner
for the past, like, five years.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.089
He's an ER nurse.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.924
-Ooh! Really? Nice.
-Yeah.

27:38.924 --> 27:39.958
He's really cute.

27:39.958 --> 27:41.260
Mine is a doctor, so--
[needle scratch]

27:41.260 --> 27:42.861
-Huh?
-Mine is a doctor.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.363
-Okay, okay. [laughs]
-I'm sorry.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.098
I didn't know
it was a competition.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.004
Hey, sin sisters!

27:53.772 --> 27:55.874
-Fancy!
-Yeah!

27:55.874 --> 27:57.609
Yeah. It's elimination day.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.611
I hope it's not me
who's going home.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.380
Oh, God, I pray.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.048
I hope so much.

28:03.048 --> 28:04.583
-Aah!
-Aah!

28:04.583 --> 28:06.051
How are you feeling?

28:06.051 --> 28:09.421
I'm feeling stressed out
about the runway.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.322
It hurts.

28:10.322 --> 28:12.124
We have a Eureka of the season.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.125
[all laugh]

28:13.125 --> 28:15.460
I'm not leaving, bitch!

28:15.460 --> 28:16.495
[all laugh]

28:16.495 --> 28:18.063
Since it's elimination day,

28:18.063 --> 28:20.299
are you all, like, confident
with your looks, and--

28:20.299 --> 28:21.333
Yeah.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.868
It's not just about
what you made,

28:22.868 --> 28:24.136
but it's how you sell it.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.905
Like, I can put on something,
like, real ugly,

28:26.905 --> 28:28.874
but then, you know,
you walk out on the runway

28:28.874 --> 28:31.476
and they're just like,
oh, wow, like, she's a star.

28:31.476 --> 28:35.447
It's all about concept
and runway presentation.

28:35.447 --> 28:36.481
Amen.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.084
We're gonna kill this, yeah!

28:39.084 --> 28:40.352
Whoo!

28:41.186 --> 28:44.556
In this room,
the energy is buzzing.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.092
The stakes are high right now.

28:47.092 --> 28:49.194
No one wants to go home
this first week.

28:49.194 --> 28:51.463
Every second counts.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.600
Icesis, you're being
very quiet over there.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.234
-Huh?
-You're being very quiet.

28:56.234 --> 28:58.804
I know. I'm concentrating.
I'm really slow.

28:58.804 --> 29:02.374
I really need to focus
to get ready.

29:02.374 --> 29:05.978
As long as I concentrate
and I take out all the noise

29:05.978 --> 29:08.814
and the nonsense from the girls,
I think I'll be fine.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.585
It's, like, so nice
to be around sisters.

29:13.585 --> 29:15.587
It's so crazy, like,
being here now

29:15.587 --> 29:16.722
with you and Gia
and Kendall, like--

29:16.722 --> 29:17.723
I know, we're all here.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.191
I know, four of us. Aah!

29:19.191 --> 29:21.293
-Four of us.
-It's overdue.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.562
Like, I remember moving
to Vancouver in 2017,

29:23.562 --> 29:24.930
and I had only been doing drag

29:24.930 --> 29:27.232
in my little small town
by myself,

29:27.232 --> 29:29.101
and going to the Junction
and seeing you

29:29.101 --> 29:30.268
and all the Brat Pack girls
performing.

29:30.268 --> 29:32.004
Brat Pack Thursdays. Ha!

29:32.004 --> 29:33.405
And I was like,
"That's what I wanna do."

29:33.405 --> 29:35.474
Yeah. It was so cool. Oh.

29:35.474 --> 29:37.175
How are you feeling about today?

29:37.175 --> 29:38.877
-I'm okay.
-Yeah?

29:38.877 --> 29:40.212
I'm definitely nervous.

29:40.212 --> 29:43.281
I'm definitely feeling a little
overwhelmed in this situation.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.284
People don't understand
what it takes

29:46.284 --> 29:49.855
to walk out on that stage
doing what we do.

29:49.855 --> 29:53.291
Doing drag
takes a ton of confidence.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.261
You know, I think I was able
to find a direction,

29:56.261 --> 29:58.196
but it definitely
took a long time,

29:58.196 --> 29:59.665
so it kind of limited to what--

29:59.665 --> 30:01.333
-That's part of the process.
-Exactly.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.668
That is part of it.

30:02.668 --> 30:05.971
Beth can be a little bit hard
on herself sometimes.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.373
Knowing her from
a competition sense previously,

30:08.373 --> 30:09.541
I have seen that.

30:09.541 --> 30:13.078
So I'm hoping that she can
push through and trust herself,

30:13.078 --> 30:15.681
because what she does
is amazing.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.621
-Who dat?
-Oh, that's my son.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.956
-Wait, your son?
-Yeah, that's my baby.

30:24.956 --> 30:26.258
His name is Quincy.

30:26.258 --> 30:27.759
-Quincy. I love it.
-Yeah.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.161
And that was when
he was younger.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.529
What? Damn!

30:30.529 --> 30:34.466
I have a cute bouncing baby
17-year-old.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.268
[laughs]

30:36.268 --> 30:37.736
-17?
-17?

30:37.736 --> 30:39.838
What? Ha!

30:39.838 --> 30:41.540
Girls, I told you,
don't judge me.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.008
Don't look at my age.

30:43.008 --> 30:45.210
Being a father
is quintessentially

30:45.210 --> 30:48.080
one of the most important things
of my life.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.383
I try to be the dad
I didn't have.

30:51.383 --> 30:54.519
So my son can always
come to me about anything.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.821
He's--honestly, he's amazing.

30:55.821 --> 30:58.523
He's a good kid.
He gets good grades.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.424
That's good.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.359
He's always been proud
that he has a gay dad

31:01.359 --> 31:02.728
And at one point, two gay dads.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.163
I did have a partner
for 10 years.

31:05.163 --> 31:06.298
Wow.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.533
And we did raise him together.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.268
So he knows you do drag.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.436
-He does. Oh, yeah, he does.
-Okay.

31:11.436 --> 31:14.239
I'm very proud that
he's as strong as who he is,

31:14.239 --> 31:17.609
and of the fact
that he loves me for me.

31:17.609 --> 31:22.047
He's never been embarrassed
about my sexuality and who I am.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.148
He's never been embarrassed

31:23.148 --> 31:24.983
about me walking the mall
in a onesie.

31:26.651 --> 31:31.423
Ocane, your makeup
has changed a lot, I think,

31:31.423 --> 31:32.724
since the first time I saw you.

31:32.724 --> 31:33.825
That's true.

31:33.825 --> 31:35.994
When I do my makeup,
I don't see anything,

31:35.994 --> 31:37.429
because I don't wear contacts.

31:37.429 --> 31:40.298
-Shut up.
-[laughs]

31:40.298 --> 31:43.769
I'm putting my makeup on
completely blind.

31:43.769 --> 31:48.206
When I remove those glasses,
I don't see a thing.

31:48.206 --> 31:52.010
I learned to do my makeup
with, like, a map.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.812
I'm drawing a map on my face.

31:53.812 --> 31:57.082
I put my brush, like,
on the corner of my eye

31:57.082 --> 31:59.451
to know where to start my lines
and everything.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.386
-Really?
-But I don't see anything.

32:01.386 --> 32:02.821
You feel your makeup.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.423
For me, makeup
is not as important

32:05.423 --> 32:09.194
as it is to give
a great performance onstage.

32:09.194 --> 32:12.597
I put more work into my persona

32:12.597 --> 32:15.133
than to say that,
ha, ha, ha, I'm beautiful.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.368
Wow.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.836
Well, honey, you're beautiful
on the inside.

Brad, what's the difference

33:09.888 --> 33:12.557
between a drag queen
and an A-list actress?

33:12.557 --> 33:14.893
Absolutely nothing.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.969
to an aspiring
Instagram thot like me?

33:23.969 --> 33:26.771
Well, you must crop it
like it's hot, baby.

Beth, I love the fact
that you used the Solo cups

and not only cut them up
to make this really gorgeous
detail,

39:42.313 --> 39:44.482
but then made them black
as well,

39:44.482 --> 39:47.652
so you did have
some element of embellishment.

39:47.652 --> 39:51.022
Your creativity
is definitely there,

39:51.022 --> 39:53.157

Beth, the dress, like,
the corsetry is amazing,

besides the fact that I just
didn't
use my time wisely.

40:23.721 --> 40:28.893
Can I just say that
on the top half is you.

40:28.893 --> 40:30.728
The bottom half
is your stinking thinking.

40:30.728 --> 40:31.629
Yeah.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.932
We both have those going on
inside of us at all times,

40:34.932 --> 40:37.969
and it's very hard in a
competitive
atmosphere as well,

40:37.969 --> 40:39.937
but you have it all in you.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.307
Thank you, judges.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.776
-Suki.
-Hello.

40:44.776 --> 40:47.378
-Mmm!
-Oh!

40:47.378 --> 40:51.282
This eleganza,
very 1920s vibe to it.

40:51.282 --> 40:53.318
You did not use a lot
from the coat check closet,

40:53.318 --> 40:56.621
but the little you did use
was very well used.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.790
-Amanda?
-Oh, jeez. Okay.

40:58.790 --> 40:59.957
You scared me.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.826
[all laugh]

41:01.826 --> 41:05.430
I love this.

41:05.430 --> 41:06.931
I want to rip it
off of your body

41:06.931 --> 41:08.566
and put it on mine
for my next premiere.

41:08.566 --> 41:10.368
I'm very impressed.

41:10.368 --> 41:11.602
I can't wait to see
the rest of the season.

41:11.602 --> 41:12.603
Well done.

41:12.603 --> 41:15.940
The only thing that
I really had in my mind is Brad.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.810
-Oh!
-And I hope I've made you proud.

41:18.810 --> 41:21.913
The fashion
was well received by me.

41:21.913 --> 41:22.880
Just make sure,

41:22.880 --> 41:24.449
especially if you're
going to wear something

41:24.449 --> 41:25.683
with so much fabric,

41:25.683 --> 41:28.953
that you take the time
to learn how it's moving.

41:28.953 --> 41:31.189
That could have been a disaster.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.691
I think I was sabotaged,
Brooke Lynn.

41:33.691 --> 41:35.093
You were sabotaged?

41:35.093 --> 41:38.429
You look so snatch and dazzling,
I couldn't walk properly.

41:38.429 --> 41:40.598
I trip almost 10 times.

41:40.598 --> 41:42.033
Then my work here is done.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.068
[all laugh]

41:44.068 --> 41:46.204
-Hi, Eve.
-Hi!

41:46.204 --> 41:48.940
-How are you?
-Uh, terrified.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.074
[all laugh]

41:50.074 --> 41:53.144
I have never completed an outfit
by myself before.

41:53.144 --> 41:57.482
I'm definitely getting
that old Hollywood glamour.

41:57.482 --> 42:00.318
For me, it's missing a polish.

42:00.318 --> 42:02.186
The waist is beautiful.

42:02.186 --> 42:05.289
The hemline
is kind of unfinished.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.759
But I also think
it's a little too short,

42:07.759 --> 42:09.327
and I saw, as you were walking,

42:09.327 --> 42:11.929
it kept, you know,
moving up and up and up.

42:11.929 --> 42:14.098
An Hollywood movie star

42:14.098 --> 42:16.567
would not have a hemline
that was that short.

42:16.567 --> 42:18.302
It was very funny
and very charming

42:18.302 --> 42:19.303
and you were very confident.

42:19.303 --> 42:22.740
My problem, really,
is the execution.

42:22.740 --> 42:25.042
I commend you, if you
have never done this before.

42:25.042 --> 42:28.646
However, you see
your competition.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.581
This is not enough.

42:31.749 --> 42:33.151
I love it, I love a drape,

42:33.151 --> 42:34.752
and I love a drape
and a ruche and a ruffle.

42:34.752 --> 42:35.953
But I can't see it.

42:35.953 --> 42:37.188
I wish you had chosen
a different fabric

42:37.188 --> 42:38.423
for the underneath thing

42:38.423 --> 42:40.124
so we could really see
that beautiful moment.

42:40.124 --> 42:42.593
And I love the hip thing.
It just--it was--

42:42.593 --> 42:44.695
I wish I had lots of options.

42:44.695 --> 42:46.464
I wish I was
a little bit taller.

42:46.464 --> 42:47.832
I wish I was a baller.

42:48.999 --> 42:52.103
-Hi, Stephanie.
-Hi.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.872
This, to me, is, like,
a Mary Katrantzou design.

42:54.872 --> 42:56.007
Yes.

42:56.007 --> 43:01.746
It was incredibly smart
to leave your legs visible,

43:01.746 --> 43:04.248
because I think if you had done
fabric
all the way around,

43:04.248 --> 43:07.051
it wouldn't be doing for
your body what it's doing now.

43:07.051 --> 43:08.386
Thank you.

43:08.386 --> 43:09.987
I cannot believe
you completed this

43:09.987 --> 43:11.789
in the amount of time
that you were given.

43:11.789 --> 43:14.058
The entire look is so cohesive.

43:14.058 --> 43:16.994
I love how the necklace
matches the accessories here.

43:16.994 --> 43:18.095
Is it from a chandelier?

43:18.095 --> 43:20.431
Chandelier, yes.
The jewelry, yeah.

43:20.431 --> 43:23.434
You made it fashion,
which is so exciting.

43:23.434 --> 43:26.070
This is just chef's kiss.

43:26.070 --> 43:27.238
-Honestly, it's--
-Thank you.

43:27.238 --> 43:28.272
And it was so smart of you

43:28.272 --> 43:30.408
to use those posters
with my name on them.

43:30.408 --> 43:32.176
It looks like a pattern.

43:32.176 --> 43:33.177
It doesn't look like writing,

43:33.177 --> 43:35.046
it looks like just
all different colors,

43:35.046 --> 43:37.181
and then to tie in the pink
down the middle,

43:37.181 --> 43:39.116
that catches the pink
in the feathers.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.485
-So congratulations.
-Thank you.

43:42.353 --> 43:45.156
-Gia Metric, hello.
-Hey.

43:45.156 --> 43:47.058
You definitely
worked that runway.

43:47.058 --> 43:50.127
Your confidence, your energy,
they're fun to watch,

43:50.127 --> 43:51.629
and you make us have fun
while you're doing it.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.899
My only issue is it doesn't
really say
eleganza to me.

43:54.899 --> 43:56.334
Right, okay.

43:56.334 --> 43:59.203
The look didn't fully
come together.

43:59.203 --> 44:01.172
I know that this is what
the kids are doing,

44:01.172 --> 44:04.542
but it doesn't really fit
the criteria.

44:04.542 --> 44:06.677
I love your energy
on the runway.

44:06.677 --> 44:08.446
The confidence is there.

44:08.446 --> 44:10.515
It's just you didn't
understand the assignment.

44:10.515 --> 44:12.817
It was red carpet eleganza
was the assignment.

44:12.817 --> 44:13.818
Okay.

44:15.152 --> 44:16.654
Icesis Couture.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.322
Hello.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.824
Your name is not
Icesis Ready-to-Wear.

44:19.824 --> 44:23.961
You lived up
to your name today, honey.

44:23.961 --> 44:29.267
And you just elevated
the shit out of this challenge.

44:29.267 --> 44:32.403
This is so special.

44:32.403 --> 44:34.138
I find you very special.

44:34.138 --> 44:35.806
Thank you so much.

44:35.806 --> 44:36.774
Can you take off your glasses?

44:36.774 --> 44:38.709
Ooh.

44:38.709 --> 44:39.610
-Good morning!
-Oh.

44:39.610 --> 44:42.280
There she is.

44:42.280 --> 44:44.348
You're not the only
pretty bitch here.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.651
[all laugh]

44:46.651 --> 44:50.354
It is very clear, from
the mini-challenge to now,

44:50.354 --> 44:52.056
that you did not come to play.

44:52.056 --> 44:53.124
One thing.

44:53.124 --> 44:54.292
Tell me, of course.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.961
I wish the mini-dress side
was a little bit higher.

44:56.961 --> 44:59.497
[all laugh]
What else do you want, huh?

44:59.497 --> 45:01.933
Actually, that's
a great suggestion.

45:01.933 --> 45:03.067
Yeah. See, that.

45:03.067 --> 45:04.502
-Do you like that better?
-Yeah.

45:04.502 --> 45:05.403
Because it was kind of--

45:05.403 --> 45:07.305
it was a little matronly
just at the knee.

45:07.305 --> 45:08.272
Thank you, Icesis.

45:08.272 --> 45:10.074
Thank you so much, judges.

45:10.074 --> 45:11.742
Thank you, queens.

45:11.742 --> 45:13.544
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

45:13.544 --> 45:15.713
the judges will order
bottle service.

45:19.817 --> 45:21.519
-Oh!
-Hi.

45:21.519 --> 45:22.520
Ooh, drinks.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.156
-The girls!
-Oh, my God.

45:25.156 --> 45:27.325
So I think
I'm gonna be lip syncing.

45:27.325 --> 45:29.093
-Aah!
-Yes.

45:29.093 --> 45:30.127
No, you're not.

45:30.127 --> 45:31.495
I do. I think so.

45:31.495 --> 45:33.764
They said that I didn't
understand
the challenge.

45:33.764 --> 45:36.400
You're not, because
I'm also in the bottom.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.735
Gasp, everybody gasp.

45:38.970 --> 45:41.672
Eve, read the room, my dear.

45:41.672 --> 45:44.442
[laughs]

45:44.442 --> 45:47.278
But I think that you both,

45:47.278 --> 45:49.080
in their eyes,
met the challenge.

45:49.080 --> 45:51.582
They said, like, neck up,
it was flawless,

45:51.582 --> 45:53.150
but--well, of course, I mean...

45:55.620 --> 45:56.654
Hmph.

45:56.654 --> 45:58.055
-So, honey-boo.
-Yes.

45:58.055 --> 46:02.827
You were talked
up the ass out there.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.895
-Thank you.
-How are you feeling?

46:04.895 --> 46:08.466
I'm actually, like, surprised.

46:08.466 --> 46:11.369
-What?
-A little bit.

46:11.369 --> 46:14.772
I just, like,
I really doubt myself a lot,

46:14.772 --> 46:19.343
and it's just nice to hear
from other people

46:19.343 --> 46:21.946
a "yes" instead
of a "no" for a change.

46:21.946 --> 46:22.980
Absolutely.

46:22.980 --> 46:27.985
Ocane, I'm gonna say right now
that this is not a great look,

46:27.985 --> 46:29.854
but I know you fucking sold it
on that runway,

46:29.854 --> 46:31.489
and I know that's what
you were going for.

46:31.489 --> 46:33.624
And that was, like,
one of my main critiques, too,

46:33.624 --> 46:36.594
was they didn't see
the confidence on my face.

46:36.594 --> 46:38.996
Yeah, they thought that
I looked stuck, which--

46:38.996 --> 46:40.331
Do you feel confident?

46:40.331 --> 46:41.832
Um...

46:43.334 --> 46:45.236
I feel like you're
a little bit into your mind.

46:45.236 --> 46:48.272
Girl, no, let me
tell you something.

46:48.272 --> 46:50.274
Girl, trust me,
there's a lot of bitches

46:50.274 --> 46:53.678
that would have cut
and fought for this space.

46:53.678 --> 46:56.313
You are here.
Be proud of that.

46:57.882 --> 47:01.619
If I am lip syncing,
that's what I do.

47:01.619 --> 47:02.620
Then you'll kill it.

47:02.620 --> 47:03.954
-That's what I do.
-Come on.

47:03.954 --> 47:05.823
Don't cry.

47:05.823 --> 47:08.225
That's what we do, though.
We dance, right?

47:08.225 --> 47:09.360
And perform.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.995
I'm scared.

47:10.995 --> 47:11.929
I have so much more to prove,

47:11.929 --> 47:15.166
and I know I can do that
if I can survive this week.

47:17.401 --> 47:21.439
So just between us club kids,
whaddaya think?

47:21.439 --> 47:22.907
Let's start with Beth.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.575
There's so much potential there,

47:24.575 --> 47:26.143
but I don't think
we saw it tonight.

47:26.143 --> 47:29.180
You could really see
the indecision in the design.

47:29.180 --> 47:33.951
The top seemed so confident
and creative and so promising,

47:33.951 --> 47:37.488
but then the bottom half
of the gown was really flat.

47:37.488 --> 47:40.825
And she's got talent, you can
tell,
and great creativity.

47:40.825 --> 47:41.892
We just need to see more of it.

47:41.892 --> 47:43.627
The top-up was fantastic.

47:43.627 --> 47:45.396
Who knew those were Solo cups?

47:45.396 --> 47:48.699
However, the confidence and
the presentation killed it for
me.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.334
Even when
we were talking to her,

47:50.334 --> 47:53.571
it felt like it was just, like,
blank,
you know what I mean?

47:53.571 --> 47:55.473
Icesis Couture.

47:55.473 --> 47:58.409
I just think, like I said,
Icesis is so special.

47:58.409 --> 48:00.010
She already knows who she is.

48:00.010 --> 48:02.179
You can see it in her eyes,
you can see it in the work,

48:02.179 --> 48:03.247
the way she works the runway.

48:03.247 --> 48:04.381
Do you think I'm special,
Amanda?

48:04.381 --> 48:06.050
I think you're the most special.

48:06.050 --> 48:07.651
You're Mommy's pretty princess.

48:07.651 --> 48:08.853
Thank you, Mommy!

48:08.853 --> 48:11.722
I love it when
she took her glasses off,

48:11.722 --> 48:14.325
her eyes were still, whoo,
just, like, to die for.

48:14.325 --> 48:17.394
It was like a reveal
at the eleventh hour.

48:17.394 --> 48:18.596
Head to toe, I just loved it.

48:18.596 --> 48:20.798
I loved how she modeled it.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.933
It looked like she spent
a week alone on that top.

48:22.933 --> 48:25.569
I don't know if you noticed
that in those big tickets,

48:25.569 --> 48:29.373
there were VIP tickets that were
almost,
like, they were thinner

48:29.373 --> 48:32.710
and they acted as longer fringe
within that fringe.

48:32.710 --> 48:34.845
She ticketed all the boxes.

48:34.845 --> 48:36.046
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, Dad.

48:36.046 --> 48:37.782
-That's okay.
-Dad joke.

48:37.782 --> 48:39.517
I'll be here all season.

48:39.517 --> 48:41.452
-[laughs]
-Groan.

48:41.452 --> 48:46.824
Now, Gia Metric has the body,
the face, the attitude.

48:46.824 --> 48:49.727
I felt like her look
was a little more Xanadu.

48:49.727 --> 48:51.462
More like Xana-don't.

48:51.462 --> 48:53.230
Exactly.

48:53.230 --> 48:54.398
I'm disappointed, honestly.

48:54.398 --> 48:56.500
I was really excited
to see what she brought,

48:56.500 --> 48:58.435
and I was a little bit
underwhelmed.

48:58.435 --> 49:00.070
Do you think she's a bit
too confident?

49:00.070 --> 49:00.971
I think maybe.

49:00.971 --> 49:03.107
I think she was just
relying on her personality

49:03.107 --> 49:05.476
and her presentation
to carry her through,

49:05.476 --> 49:07.444
and she just didn't really
think about the assignment.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.846
Yeah.

49:08.846 --> 49:10.214
Stephanie.

49:10.214 --> 49:11.715
Stephanie's creativity
blew me away.

49:11.715 --> 49:14.018
I thought
it was very smart, clever.

49:14.018 --> 49:14.952
I thought it was a great job.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.922
It was beautifully constructed,
it was modeled beautifully.

49:17.922 --> 49:21.425
She's feisty and sparky,
but in the best way possible.

49:21.425 --> 49:23.727
And I don't even know if a lot
of super-skilled designers

49:23.727 --> 49:26.664
could pull that off
and have shape.

49:26.664 --> 49:27.865
She challenged herself.
Go, Calgary!

49:27.865 --> 49:30.301
The first ever Calgary queen
on the show.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.202
She's representing.

49:31.202 --> 49:34.205
And she's representing
the midwest of Canada.

49:34.205 --> 49:35.706
There we go.

49:35.706 --> 49:37.274
Eve 6000.

49:37.274 --> 49:40.845
My problem
was with the execution.

49:40.845 --> 49:42.346
It just looked a little sloppy,

49:42.346 --> 49:43.614
and if you're gonna
put that much time

49:43.614 --> 49:45.216
into an inspiration and story,

49:45.216 --> 49:47.384
put the same amount of time
into your garment.

49:47.384 --> 49:49.353
It was almost there for me.

49:49.353 --> 49:51.255
If that bottom had been longer,

49:51.255 --> 49:52.723
I think it would have been
really beautiful.

49:52.723 --> 49:54.258
I liked that she was having fun
on the runway.

49:54.258 --> 49:57.027
She wasn't afraid
to be campy and different.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.062
It's a really tough one,

49:58.062 --> 50:01.131
because I feel like there's
a star in there, right?

50:01.131 --> 50:02.967
She's amping up, I think.

50:02.967 --> 50:06.036
I think she's getting--you know,
she's, like, maybe an Eve 3000.

50:06.036 --> 50:08.906
And I think we came down
a little bit, you know.

50:08.906 --> 50:10.207
[all laugh]

50:10.207 --> 50:12.409
Caitlin for the win,
ladies and gentlemen.

50:12.409 --> 50:16.847
Suki Doll, that entire garment
was beautiful.

50:16.847 --> 50:20.184
It was artistic
and whimsical and daring.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.152
I feel like every element
was thought of,

50:22.152 --> 50:24.054
and then she got onto the runway

50:24.054 --> 50:26.790
and was like, "Oh, damn,
I gotta walk in this now."

50:26.790 --> 50:29.026
I loved it, but my one thing is

50:29.026 --> 50:31.662
most of that look
was from the Fabricland wall,

50:31.662 --> 50:34.098
and very little was from
the coat check closet.

50:35.099 --> 50:38.235
Well, we have
some big decisions to make.

50:39.570 --> 50:42.206
Bring back our bottle girls.

50:43.307 --> 50:45.676
Welcome back, my queens.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.077
We've made some decisions.

50:49.446 --> 50:51.348
Icesis Couture.

50:51.348 --> 50:54.418
On the runway,
you were on a roll,

50:54.418 --> 50:57.354
and your look, my dear,
was the ticket.

50:59.723 --> 51:00.858
Suki Doll.

51:00.858 --> 51:03.227
Your premiere party eleganza

51:03.227 --> 51:06.397
made us wanna give you
the key to the VIP.

51:07.932 --> 51:09.833
Stephanie Prince.

51:09.833 --> 51:12.469
In theory,
your look should be all wrong,

51:12.469 --> 51:13.871
but on the runway,

51:13.871 --> 51:16.206
you had the DJ
playing our favorite song.

51:16.206 --> 51:18.676
[laughs]

51:18.676 --> 51:21.679
Icesis Couture,
con-drag-ulations.

51:21.679 --> 51:24.214
[cheering]

51:24.214 --> 51:26.150
Yes, girl.

51:26.150 --> 51:28.052
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

51:28.052 --> 51:30.554
You have won an amazing
home entertainment package

51:30.554 --> 51:34.191
valued at $5.000
from The Source.

51:34.191 --> 51:35.960
Ooh!

51:35.960 --> 51:38.696
Oh, my God, I'm the winner
of this week's maxi-challenge.

51:38.696 --> 51:40.264
Oh, my God, I did it!

51:40.264 --> 51:42.766
You may join the other queens.

51:46.537 --> 51:49.139
Suki and Stephanie,
incredible work.

51:49.139 --> 51:50.607
You are both safe.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.910
You may both step
to the back of the stage.

51:58.983 --> 52:02.052
Beth. We liked
what your look was about,

52:02.052 --> 52:05.489
but your runway presentation
seemed coat-checked out.

52:06.623 --> 52:09.193
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you are up for elimination.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.132
Gia Metric.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.434
Your face is acute,

52:17.434 --> 52:20.437
but your runway look tonight
was obtuse.

52:22.006 --> 52:23.207
Eve 6000.

52:23.207 --> 52:26.610
Your personality
had us drunk in love,

52:26.610 --> 52:29.380
but your runway tonight
left us with a hangover.

52:31.382 --> 52:33.584
Gia Metric.

52:33.584 --> 52:35.986
I'm sorry to say,
but you are up for elimination.

52:40.724 --> 52:43.027
Eve 6000, you are safe.

52:44.228 --> 52:46.130
Please join your sisters
at the back.

52:46.130 --> 52:47.364
Thank you.

52:51.001 --> 52:52.669
[sobs]

52:56.073 --> 52:58.075
It's not a good idea for me
to take this step right now.

52:58.075 --> 53:00.411
Oh, my God. Aah!

53:00.411 --> 53:01.678
See, I told you
it wasn't a good idea

53:01.678 --> 53:04.381
for me to take the step
right now.

53:08.719 --> 53:11.255
Eve, the judges
just told you you're safe.

53:11.255 --> 53:14.091
Shut up.
Cry about it tomorrow.

53:14.091 --> 53:17.628

53:17.628 --> 53:20.631
Bitch, I'm literally
standing here

53:20.631 --> 53:23.033
about to lip sync for my life,

53:23.033 --> 53:26.403
and all I can hear is this,
like, howl in the back.

53:26.403 --> 53:29.239
[cries]

53:29.239 --> 53:33.477
Eve, I know a theater queen,
and you put on a good show.

53:33.477 --> 53:35.145
Cry for the camera, honey.

53:38.148 --> 53:40.417
Two queens stand before us.

53:43.087 --> 53:45.989
Prior to tonight,
you were asked to prepare

53:45.989 --> 53:50.160
a lip sync performance
of Nelly Furtado's Maneater.

53:50.160 --> 53:53.597
This is your last chance
to impress us

53:53.597 --> 53:56.567
and save yourself
from elimination.

53:58.869 --> 54:01.405
The time has come...
[thunder]

54:01.405 --> 54:03.207
for you to lip sync...

54:03.207 --> 54:06.910
[echoing] for your life.

54:10.180 --> 54:11.115
I am going up against

54:11.115 --> 54:14.218
one of the best performers
in the entire country.

54:14.218 --> 54:18.489
I know what Gia's capable of,
but I am not ready to go home.

54:18.489 --> 54:20.724
I am gonna sell this song.

54:20.724 --> 54:25.596
Good luck, and don't
fuck it the fuck up.
