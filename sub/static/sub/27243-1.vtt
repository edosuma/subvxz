Good morning, Marvin.

Marvin, turn off the speakers.

00:38.973 --> 00:41.607
<i>Speakers deactivated.</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:55.354
Marvin, check my mail and texts.

01:06.233 --> 01:07.800
<i>Call scheduled.</i>

01:13.774 --> 01:14.774
Hannah Morris speaking.

01:14.842 --> 01:15.507
<i>Hannah Morris?</i>

01:15.609 --> 01:17.242
<i>The creator of Perfect One,</i>

01:17.344 --> 01:19.511
<i>North America's most popular
dating app?</i>

01:19.613 --> 01:20.512
Hey there, Sis.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.125
You know, for someone
who works in tech,

01:22.149 --> 01:23.982
you're not very easy
to get a hold of.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.150
<i>Yes, I know, I'm sorry.</i>

01:25.252 --> 01:26.085
<i>It's been hectic.</i>

01:26.187 --> 01:27.330
Christmas is our busiest time
of year,

01:27.354 --> 01:28.520
everyone's looking for love,

01:28.622 --> 01:31.190
and I just have to make sure
the database doesn't crash.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.525
<i>So, without you,
love could be lost?</i>

01:33.627 --> 01:35.394
The pressure.

01:35.496 --> 01:38.931
Speaking of looking for love,
how is Jonathan?

01:39.033 --> 01:39.898
It's Jason.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.133
Close enough.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.067
<i>He's great.</i>

01:42.169 --> 01:43.580
We have date number 10
this weekend.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.970
<i>Wow, 10?</i>

01:45.072 --> 01:46.371
You must really like this one.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.372
<i>Yeah, I do, I do.</i>

01:47.475 --> 01:48.475
<i>He's...</i>

01:48.542 --> 01:51.610
He's smart, he's successful,
he's organized.

01:51.712 --> 01:52.544
Always on time.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.291
He's got all the things
on my list.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.355
He sounds like the male version
of you.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.182
<i>What does he do again?</i>

01:57.284 --> 01:58.050
<i>Stock market?</i>

01:58.152 --> 01:59.351
<i>Financial analyst?</i>

01:59.453 --> 02:01.173
He works at a private
equity firm.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.255
Right. Sounds thrilling.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.858
You know, I can actually hear
your eyes rolling?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.094
So listen, I'm only going to ask
you this one more time.

02:09.196 --> 02:12.264
Are you absolutely sure you
can't come home for Christmas?

02:12.366 --> 02:13.844
Dad would really love
to see you.

02:13.868 --> 02:16.568
It's been years since you spent
the holidays in Jackson.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.670
Hang on, I was there
two years ago.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.772
<i>For, like, 12 hours!</i>

02:20.875 --> 02:21.875
We miss you.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.542
She really means it, I swear.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.478
You know I would love to see you
guys so much, I just...

02:26.580 --> 02:27.924
I have to stay close
to the office

02:27.948 --> 02:29.092
in case something goes wrong.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.393
But, a... as soon as things
slow down,

02:30.417 --> 02:31.695
I'll come out and see you, okay?

02:31.719 --> 02:32.518
<i>Okay.</i>

02:32.620 --> 02:34.520
It's just sometimes,
it feels like...

02:34.622 --> 02:36.522
you intentionally avoid
coming home.

02:37.725 --> 02:38.624
What!?

02:38.726 --> 02:39.846
<i>What's wrong, are you okay?</i>

02:39.927 --> 02:43.629
I'm sorry, I gotta go, this
is a... a work emergency.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.538
We dropped again?

02:52.640 --> 02:53.472
For the third month in a row?

02:53.574 --> 02:55.318
This is our most popular time
of year!

02:55.342 --> 02:57.020
Could... could the new report
be wrong?

02:57.044 --> 02:58.243
I'm afraid not.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.623
I was hoping we would have
an upswing,

02:59.647 --> 03:01.525
with it being Christmas
and all, but...

03:01.549 --> 03:03.081
We are officially in trouble.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.651
No one is falling in love
on Perfect One.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.352
And word is spreading.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.454
Fast.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.354
That can't be right.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.157
I designed the algorithm
to match people

03:12.259 --> 03:13.125
with their perfect companion

03:13.227 --> 03:14.938
based on an extensive
personality test,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.196
birth order, economic status,
everything!

03:17.298 --> 03:19.109
I've been reading our user
feedback all morning,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.900
and people are sick of the lack
of romance involved

03:22.002 --> 03:23.535
in online dating.

03:23.637 --> 03:27.172
I guess people want to fall
in love the old-fashioned way.

03:27.274 --> 03:28.974
How? At a speakeasy?

03:29.076 --> 03:31.054
This is the 21st century,
for crying out loud.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.945
That's what you need
to figure out.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.179
Why just me?

03:34.281 --> 03:36.521
You're the creative brains
behind this whole operation.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.083
<i>I'm business and sales.</i>

03:38.185 --> 03:39.918
<i>And you create.</i>

03:41.121 --> 03:42.254
Okay.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.256
Naomi, we can't let this happen.

03:44.358 --> 03:46.118
We built this company
from nothing.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.026
It's already happening.

03:48.128 --> 03:50.896
And it's only gonna get worse;
we need to start thinking about

03:50.998 --> 03:53.699
a total rebrand to come out
of this alive.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.801
Okay.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.502
Okay, I, I will re-examine
the algorithms,

03:57.605 --> 03:59.365
I'll make 'em better,
more precise.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.907
What if we need to take a step
back from the numbers,

04:02.009 --> 04:05.444
and focus on understanding
the spark.

04:05.546 --> 04:06.411
The spark.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.014
What is that, like a new
software program?

04:09.116 --> 04:10.482
No!

04:10.584 --> 04:12.184
The spark.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.652
You know, when we meet someone,

04:13.754 --> 04:16.188
and it just feels like
everything is magic?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.500
It's the moment we realize
we're starting to fall in love.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.392
That's what people wanna feel.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.861
Especially at Christmas-time.

04:22.963 --> 04:26.064
And Perfect One
doesn't have that.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.899
Have you ever been in love?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.868
Yeah.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.670
It was forever ago.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.306
So... Before smartphones?

04:34.408 --> 04:35.408
Yes.

04:35.509 --> 04:36.942
Exactly.

04:37.044 --> 04:40.012
You have to find a way
to blend the traditional

04:40.114 --> 04:42.648
and sentimental ways
of falling in love...

04:42.750 --> 04:44.249
with modern technology.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.018
Okay.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.819
I will stay late every night.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.389
So, what you need is to get away
from the office

04:50.491 --> 04:51.857
and get inspired again.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.293
I'm sorry, a... away
from the office?

04:54.395 --> 04:56.195
It's almost two weeks
until Christmas.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.563
Take that time to spend
more of it with Jason.

04:58.666 --> 05:04.002
I'll stay here and manage
the PR and the budget cuts.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.071
Go find that spark.

05:07.675 --> 05:08.473
<i>Jason!</i>

05:08.575 --> 05:09.741
It's Hannah, again.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.710
We need to talk?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.945
Can you just, just call me back?

05:14.048 --> 05:15.247
When you get a chance.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.381
Soon? Please? Thank you.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.817
Okay. Bye.

05:19.887 --> 05:22.421
<i>Incoming email from
Jason Gallagher.</i>

05:23.257 --> 05:24.122
Yes.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.891
Good. Good, good, good, good!

05:25.993 --> 05:27.637
"Dear Hannah, I got
your messages.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.639
"I know you don't like long,
drawn out emails,

05:29.663 --> 05:30.796
"so I will keep this short.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.597
"This just isn't working."

05:33.767 --> 05:34.767
What?

05:34.802 --> 05:36.068
"I'm sorry.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.014
"I can't be in a relationship
that lacks any real connection.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.305
"I might as well be dating
a robot

05:40.407 --> 05:43.308
"with all of the automated
messages I get from you.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.155
"I wish you all the best, but
we just aren't right together.

05:45.179 --> 05:48.780
"Merry Christmas, Jason."

05:48.882 --> 05:52.084
Did I just get dumped via email?

05:53.320 --> 05:55.620
Okay.

05:55.723 --> 05:57.167
Okay, who else can I spend
time with?

05:57.191 --> 05:59.358
Let me see, let me see,
let me see.

06:00.361 --> 06:03.128
Okay, let's see, let's see.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.730
Mike.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.932
He's a little clingy...

06:08.235 --> 06:09.067
Jeremy!

06:09.169 --> 06:12.337
The weird eyebrow
thing happening.

06:12.439 --> 06:16.975
Come on...

06:17.077 --> 06:19.945
Chad.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.380
Yeah, Chad was nice.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.615
He was good.

06:23.717 --> 06:24.717
Okay.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.018
Marvin.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.121
Call Chad.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.454
<i>Calling dad.</i>

06:29.556 --> 06:30.822
No. No, no!

06:30.924 --> 06:31.790
Chad!

06:31.892 --> 06:33.425
Marvin, hang up.
Call Chad!

06:33.527 --> 06:36.128
<i>Hello?</i>

06:36.230 --> 06:37.230
Hi dad!

06:37.331 --> 06:38.196
<i>Hannah!</i>

06:38.298 --> 06:40.265
<i>I'm so glad you called.</i>

06:40.367 --> 06:42.412
I feel like I haven't talked
to you in ages.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.468
<i>How's work?</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:46.071
Saving the world, one set
of lovebirds at a time?

06:46.173 --> 06:48.173
Not exactly.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.510
Things are not going super well
at work right now, to be honest.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.511
I'm sorry to hear that.

06:52.613 --> 06:54.524
But you'll turn it around,
you always do.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.715
I'm not so sure this time.

06:56.817 --> 06:59.151
Does Naomi have you working
over the holidays?

06:59.253 --> 07:00.819
<i>Not anymore.</i>

07:00.921 --> 07:02.120
Well now, wait a minute.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.524
Does that mean you can come
home for Christmas after all?

07:05.626 --> 07:06.258
No!

07:06.360 --> 07:07.225
No! That's not...

07:07.327 --> 07:08.327
<i>Great!</i>

07:08.362 --> 07:09.895
It'll be like old times again.

07:09.997 --> 07:10.997
I'll get your room ready.

07:11.064 --> 07:11.797
Wait, hold on.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.498
Dad, I... I...

07:14.468 --> 07:15.367
Can't wait!

07:15.469 --> 07:17.202
Your sister will be thrilled.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.188
Hannah!

07:36.290 --> 07:36.888
Dad!

07:36.990 --> 07:38.590
I told you not to wait up!

07:39.426 --> 07:40.859
I was too excited to sleep.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.662
Welcome home.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.263
Where are all the decorations?

07:45.365 --> 07:47.243
Normally you have them up
by November 1st.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.600
It's just me in the house.

07:48.702 --> 07:49.835
It seemed a bit silly.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.136
Not even a tree?

07:51.238 --> 07:53.316
You love decorating a tree.
It's your favourite tradition.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.974
Well, sometimes, you have
to let go of the past,

07:56.076 --> 07:58.043
and Lucy and Joe
always invite me over

07:58.145 --> 08:00.178
to decorate theirs anyway, huh?

08:00.280 --> 08:01.724
Come on, get this
stuff upstairs.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.715
You must be tired.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.550
<i>There we go.</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:17.229
<i>Some things never change.</i>

08:17.331 --> 08:18.430
<i>A lot of happy memories.</i>

08:18.532 --> 08:20.131
It's late. I'll let you unpack.

08:20.234 --> 08:21.099
Glad to have you home.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.502
Goodnight, dad.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.981
See you in the morning,
Sweetheart.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.505
Okay.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.772
<i>Marvin. Close the blinds.</i>

09:03.544 --> 09:05.143
Marvin.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.978
Please close blinds.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.248
Marvin!

09:14.521 --> 09:16.288
Yeah.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.599
Good morning.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.500
Good morning!

09:28.602 --> 09:29.701
How'd you sleep?

09:29.803 --> 09:30.869
Fine.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.005
That, mattress could use
a little upgrade though.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.341
Hey, what's the WiFi password
here again?

09:36.443 --> 09:37.342
I should've told you.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.444
I got rid of the internet
a few months ago.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.211
Are you serious?

09:40.314 --> 09:41.379
Well, what can I say?

09:41.448 --> 09:43.493
An accountant always looks
where he can save a buck.

09:43.517 --> 09:45.216
Plus, I've got it at work.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.196
Why do you need the internet
all the time?

09:47.220 --> 09:48.653
To check my email?

09:48.755 --> 09:51.389
The news? Social media?
Bank account?

09:51.491 --> 09:53.570
Number of steps I've taken?
Number of hours I've slept?

09:53.594 --> 09:54.626
I could go on.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.648
I'm surprised you know how
to breathe without it.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.196
Okay.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.464
Where's the coffee maker?

09:59.566 --> 10:00.665
About that.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.345
I went to that new doctor
in town about stomach pains,

10:02.369 --> 10:04.002
and he suggested I quit.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.805
So... there's no internet
or coffee?

10:06.907 --> 10:07.739
I'm sorry, honey.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.341
I have lots of tea!

10:09.443 --> 10:11.276
No, it's... it's fine,
I'll just...

10:11.378 --> 10:14.079
go to a cafe in town after
breakfast and get some coffee.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.380
Check my email.

10:15.482 --> 10:16.759
While you're out,
would you mind,

10:16.783 --> 10:18.595
mailing some Christmas cards
for me?

10:18.619 --> 10:21.419
So you're still writing out
all those cards to everyone?

10:21.521 --> 10:24.122
Some traditions I just
can't seem to let go of.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.423
You know, if you had WiFi,

10:25.525 --> 10:29.060
I could set up your email so
that a virtual Christmas card

10:29.162 --> 10:31.229
goes out to everyone
automatically every year.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.931
It would save you a ton of time.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.667
You know, snail mail really is
a thing of the past, dad.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.204
There's more to life
than increasing its speed.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.572
Come on.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.207
Thanks dad, this looks great.

10:44.077 --> 10:48.013
Well, your mom's old recipe.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.616
So, how are things going
with the new guy you're dating?

10:51.718 --> 10:54.686
Well, he broke up
with me actually.

10:54.788 --> 10:55.788
In an email.

10:56.123 --> 10:56.788
No. I'm sorry.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.089
You deserve better than that.

10:58.191 --> 10:58.990
It's fine.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.893
We weren't really working,
anyway.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.629
Do you ever think about
meeting someone new?

11:04.731 --> 11:06.209
Putting yourself
out there again?

11:07.167 --> 11:07.999
I wouldn't even know
where to start!

11:08.101 --> 11:10.335
Well, I could get you
a smartphone.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.948
And then, you could sign up
for Perfect One.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.383
I'm sure there are tons of women
out there

11:13.407 --> 11:14.684
that would love to spend time
with you.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.907
You're a total catch!

11:16.009 --> 11:18.610
I'm too old school
for that techie stuff.

11:18.712 --> 11:22.047
Besides, I'm fine as I am.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.348
Are you?

11:23.450 --> 11:24.249
Of course!

11:24.351 --> 11:25.617
I have a good life.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.721
I have two beautiful daughters,
and the most wonderful grandson.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.990
Don't you worry about me.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.517
Can I help you?

11:59.619 --> 12:00.863
Grande mocha frappuccino,
hold the whip.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.088
And the WiFi, please?

12:03.190 --> 12:06.291
Is that order a joke?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.528
Hannah.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.297
Sam.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.565
You're home!

12:13.667 --> 12:15.033
You're here.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.335
I own the place.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.739
I...

12:20.841 --> 12:23.007
It's, it's very vintage.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.037
Yeah, I took it over
five years ago.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.690
Figured I'd keep it
the same way.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.380
How nostalgic of you.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.783
Well, if it ain't broke,
why fix it?

12:31.885 --> 12:33.184
To improve things.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.454
Keep up with the 21st century.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.258
How are... how are you?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.659
How are... how are your parents?

12:41.762 --> 12:43.706
They're just a couple
of snowbirds now.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.597
They spend the winters
down south.

12:45.699 --> 12:48.199
Are you gonna go down and
see them over the holiday?

12:49.503 --> 12:51.069
Got a business to run.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.838
I'm sure you can remember I
wasn't exactly Mr. Christmas.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.040
Right. Right.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.054
Speaking of Mr. Christmas,
how is your dad?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.455
I haven't seen him
for a few weeks.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.512
He's good.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.781
He actually seems
a little lonely.

13:02.883 --> 13:03.960
Kinda wish he'd meet
someone new,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.284
it's been so long since...

13:06.386 --> 13:07.485
Yeah.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.588
Look, I'm... I'm sure he'll find
someone when he's ready.

13:10.690 --> 13:12.824
You can't rush these things.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.493
I updated the inventory.
We are all stocked up.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.662
Thanks, Julie.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.664
Did... did I interrupt
something?

13:19.766 --> 13:20.766
No.

13:20.834 --> 13:21.699
- No.
- No.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.045
Julie, Th... this is Hannah.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.204
We... went to high school
together.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.307
She's the reason
I passed physics.

13:30.577 --> 13:32.911
So, you knew Sam
back in high school?

13:33.013 --> 13:35.446
I bet all the girls had
a crush on him.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.183
Something like that.

13:42.122 --> 13:46.191
I, gotta go!

13:46.293 --> 13:47.859
Merry Christmas.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.695
Merry Christmas.

13:50.797 --> 13:54.332
Hey, didn't you want
a... coffee?

14:00.907 --> 14:02.140
Aunt Hannah!

14:02.242 --> 14:02.974
Max!

14:03.076 --> 14:04.620
Oh, my goodness, you're a giant!

14:04.644 --> 14:05.644
How did you get so big?

14:05.745 --> 14:06.344
How are you?

14:06.446 --> 14:07.245
Good.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.925
I just signed up
for Christmas Cupid!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.860
I've never heard of it,
but that sounds amazing.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.430
I can't believe
you're really here!

14:14.454 --> 14:15.498
How'd you know where to find me?

14:15.522 --> 14:16.554
Dad called me.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.656
Also, everyone knows
Hannah Morris can't go more

14:18.725 --> 14:21.659
than two minutes upon waking
without her caffeine fix.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.628
You, my dear, have a problem.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.007
By the way, speaking of which,

14:25.031 --> 14:27.665
thanks for telling me that Sam
now owns the cafe downtown!

14:27.767 --> 14:29.846
It's exactly the kind of thing
I was hoping to avoid.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.735
Yikes.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.370
Awkward small-talk with an ex?

14:32.472 --> 14:33.472
The past.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.206
Was it weird to see him?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.468
No, we broke up when I was
a sophomore in college.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.010
I mean, we were kids.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.112
It was like the Mesozoic era.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.214
You were alive
with the dinosaurs?

14:43.316 --> 14:44.316
Cool!

14:44.985 --> 14:45.650
Yes, I was.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.619
You didn't answer my question.

14:48.521 --> 14:49.254
Okay, fine.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.588
Next topic.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.724
Dad invited us over
for lunch today.

14:52.826 --> 14:54.370
He's so excited
to have you home.

14:54.394 --> 14:57.095
It... it's making me question
who his favourite really is.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.297
Does he seem kind of lonely
to you?

14:59.399 --> 15:01.177
He hasn't even put up
any decorations.

15:01.201 --> 15:02.901
I know, but what do you expect?

15:03.003 --> 15:06.404
He lives alone and spends
all of his time at the office.

15:06.506 --> 15:09.007
The apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

15:09.109 --> 15:09.941
What's that mean?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.776
Mom, can we go to
the candy store now?

15:11.878 --> 15:12.510
You promised.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.846
Yes, yes I promised.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.068
Do you want to come with us?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.460
I just have to drop off
a couple Christmas cards

15:17.484 --> 15:18.861
for dad at the post office
first, but then,

15:18.885 --> 15:20.630
I will meet you back
at the house, okay?

15:20.654 --> 15:22.220
See you there, sis!

15:28.261 --> 15:29.794
Hannah Morris!

15:29.896 --> 15:31.863
What a pleasant surprise!

15:31.965 --> 15:33.665
Mrs. Monroe!

15:33.767 --> 15:36.501
I haven't seen you since I
taught 12th grade English.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.303
And please, call me Martha.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.582
I didn't know you worked here.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.340
You bet, ever since I retired
from the high school.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.562
What can I do for you today?

15:43.610 --> 15:46.077
Yeah, I just need to get
some stamps for these.

15:51.818 --> 15:55.453
You interested in signing up
for the town's Christmas Cupid?

15:55.555 --> 15:57.989
My nephew was just talking
about that.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.290
What is it, exactly?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.370
Well, it's an old Christmas
tradition the town used to do

16:01.394 --> 16:03.061
during the Second World War.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.630
Strangers would write to each
other in the hopes of either

16:05.732 --> 16:07.692
forming a deep friendship,
or better yet,

16:07.767 --> 16:09.067
falling in love.

16:09.169 --> 16:10.034
All you have to do is sign up,

16:10.136 --> 16:12.670
and I connect you
with a secret pen pal.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.906
Match-making's my specialty.

16:15.008 --> 16:15.873
Pen pal, huh?

16:15.976 --> 16:17.508
Yup.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.289
Then all the letters have to be delivered
either to that mailbox over there,

16:20.313 --> 16:22.413
or the red one outside.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.094
And I'll make sure all the
letters get to the right house.

16:25.118 --> 16:27.463
That seems like quite a bit of
hassle when it's so much easier

16:27.487 --> 16:28.886
just to meet someone online.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.833
Well, you'd be surprised
how many people prefer

16:30.857 --> 16:31.857
to write letters.

16:31.925 --> 16:33.257
Half the town signed up.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.427
So, why did the tradition stop?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.441
Well, during the war,
the post office made sure

16:38.465 --> 16:40.176
that letters were delivered
very quickly.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.500
It was the only way loved ones
could keep in touch.

16:42.602 --> 16:44.402
But once the war ended,

16:44.504 --> 16:47.672
using the phone became cheaper,
more efficient, and more modern.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.774
A little too modern
if you ask me.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.342
This could be perfect.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.343
Great!

16:52.445 --> 16:53.845
I'll get you a signup sheet.

16:53.947 --> 16:54.947
No, no, no.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.482
No, not for me, no.
For my dad.

16:57.584 --> 16:58.627
Can I run home
and bring him back?

16:58.651 --> 17:00.685
Of course, but today's
the last day to sign up.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.220
Okay. I will be back.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.554
Thanks, Mrs. Monroe.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.856
Martha!

17:05.724 --> 17:08.593
Thanks for waiting.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.194
Dad!

17:10.296 --> 17:11.061
<i>Yup?</i>

17:11.164 --> 17:12.164
Hey!

17:12.232 --> 17:14.143
So, you have to sign up
for Christmas Cupid.

17:14.166 --> 17:17.201
It is the perfect way for you
to meet someone new.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.170
Hello to you, too.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.838
Joe. Hi!

17:20.940 --> 17:22.507
Good to see you!

17:22.608 --> 17:24.753
Is that that pen pal thing
everyone keeps talkin' about

17:24.778 --> 17:25.576
at the office?

17:25.678 --> 17:26.444
Yes, exactly!

17:26.546 --> 17:28.479
You are such a great writer.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.148
Aren't pen pals for kids?

17:30.250 --> 17:31.315
No!

17:31.418 --> 17:33.429
Liz, would you just tell dad
that he has to sign up

17:33.453 --> 17:34.952
for the Christmas Cupid thingy?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.254
I signed up, Grandpa!

17:37.190 --> 17:38.756
Maybe we'll be pen pals!

17:38.858 --> 17:40.058
I think it's a great idea.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.892
See?

17:40.994 --> 17:42.593
For you.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.295
What? For me?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.731
Now that I can get
on board with.

17:46.833 --> 17:47.965
Okay. Nice try.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.700
But... no!

17:49.803 --> 17:51.347
I need to spend every
waking moment

17:51.371 --> 17:53.471
trying to save Perfect One.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.140
Naomi needs me to focus on
researching old fashioned ways

17:56.242 --> 18:00.311
of falling in love that are
both timeless and sentimental.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.850
No. For... for other people!
Not for me!

18:05.952 --> 18:07.963
Besides, I don't, I don't even
wanna meet someone new.

18:07.987 --> 18:09.020
I just got dumped.

18:09.122 --> 18:09.954
So...

18:10.056 --> 18:11.467
Technically, you're
not meeting them.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.890
You're just writing to them.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.192
Yeah.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.294
Okay, you know what,

18:15.361 --> 18:16.227
this whole thing was supposed
to be about dad?

18:16.329 --> 18:18.429
So, I'm not quite sure
what's happening.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.199
Why don't you both sign up?

18:21.301 --> 18:22.166
Brilliant!

18:22.268 --> 18:22.900
Really?

18:23.002 --> 18:24.902
<i>Now that seems fair to me.</i>

18:25.004 --> 18:29.373
The only way I will sign up
is if you do, too!

18:29.476 --> 18:30.908
You serious right now?

18:31.010 --> 18:33.244
Do we have a deal?

18:41.387 --> 18:42.898
You know what, it might
actually be good

18:42.922 --> 18:43.922
for research purposes.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.023
So, okay, fine.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.404
That's the only reason
I'm doing it.

18:48.428 --> 18:51.362
Well, looks like Christmas
just got a lot more interesting.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.498
Boy, I'll say!

18:53.600 --> 18:54.866
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:01.207 --> 19:02.406
Here you go!

19:03.376 --> 19:04.509
You're back!

19:04.611 --> 19:06.043
Nice to see you, Teddy.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.211
You too, Martha.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.715
Somehow, my daughters have
convinced me to sign up

19:10.817 --> 19:12.750
for this Christmas Cupid affair.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.652
Well, I think that's splendid.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.187
I'll get you a signup sheet.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.456
And one for my Hannah here, too.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.924
Delightful!

19:20.026 --> 19:21.026
You're just in time.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.828
The first letters are gonna
arrive tomorrow.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.763
And after you finish signing up,

19:25.865 --> 19:28.199
something sweet
to say thank you.

19:28.301 --> 19:28.966
All right.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.868
Woo!

19:31.771 --> 19:34.805
Now, the first rule is, every
letter has to be handwritten.

19:34.908 --> 19:37.175
No computers, phones, gizmos
or gadgets allowed.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.910
But typing is so much faster.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.179
Speed is not the goal here!

19:41.281 --> 19:43.014
Music to my ears!

19:43.116 --> 19:44.382
And the second rule is,

19:44.484 --> 19:46.651
you have to come up
with a pen name.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.686
A fake name? Why?

19:48.788 --> 19:49.654
The experience will be
so much richer

19:49.756 --> 19:51.889
if you don't know
who you're writing to.

19:51.991 --> 19:55.193
Plus, on Christmas Eve, there's
a Christmas Cupid festival,

19:55.295 --> 19:58.062
where everyone will finally
reveal their true identities

19:58.164 --> 19:58.963
to one another.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.631
It's gonna be so fun.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.100
Try to think of a name
that reminds you of a special

20:03.203 --> 20:04.835
Christmas memory.

20:04.938 --> 20:06.871
How about Bing?

20:06.973 --> 20:09.407
White Christmas was
a favourite of ours,

20:09.509 --> 20:10.641
wasn't it, Hannah?

20:10.743 --> 20:12.588
Yeah, we used to watch it
every year.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.811
Great choice.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.113
How about you, Hannah?

20:21.387 --> 20:23.721
Stardust.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.092
Here goes nothin'.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.968
Hey, dad?

20:37.070 --> 20:38.070
Yeah?

20:38.171 --> 20:40.438
Do you remember how
your parents fell in love?

20:40.540 --> 20:41.806
I do, why do you ask?

20:41.908 --> 20:43.819
I'm just trying to figure out
how people

20:43.843 --> 20:45.543
from their generation met.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.223
Well, it was an
ice cream parlour.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.081
Dad worked there,
and she came in every...

20:50.183 --> 20:52.583
every Tuesday for
a root beer float.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.597
Eventually, he mustered up
enough courage

20:54.621 --> 20:56.754
to ask her to a movie.

20:56.856 --> 21:00.124
That, and an extra scoop of
ice cream sealed the deal.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.793
I'm guessing you don't know
how mom's parents met?

21:02.895 --> 21:04.028
I wish I did.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.041
But your mom was too young
when they died.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.945
I would have loved to have
met them.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.268
Yeah, me too.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.402
Ooh.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.504
<i>Hey!</i>

21:12.572 --> 21:13.572
Hey!

21:14.874 --> 21:16.207
Look what I just found!

21:16.309 --> 21:18.776
That did not take long.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.444
One for Bing.

21:22.148 --> 21:22.980
And one for Stardust.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.449
What is hangin' off
of these letters?

21:25.551 --> 21:27.551
It looks like an invitation
to something.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.053
Yes!

21:29.155 --> 21:31.522
"Welcome to the First Annual
Christmas Cupid.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.291
"Since 1945.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.893
"All participants are invited
to a free skate

21:35.995 --> 21:38.696
"at the local arena tonight
at 6:00 P.M.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.564
"Come for a chance
to brush shoulders

21:40.667 --> 21:42.133
"with your new pen pal."

21:42.235 --> 21:44.869
Well, I haven't skated since,
sixth grade?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.504
So, yeah. Count me out.

21:46.606 --> 21:47.371
Hey, nice try!

21:47.473 --> 21:48.784
We're in this together,
remember?

21:48.808 --> 21:49.840
Well, in her defence,

21:49.942 --> 21:51.754
she's possibly the worst skater
in the country.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.978
Yeah, that's...
That's my point exactly.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.114
A deal's a deal, kiddo.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.717
Come on, read your
letters already.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.453
Okay. All right.

22:12.732 --> 22:15.299
"Dear Stardust: I must confess

22:15.401 --> 22:16.779
"that I almost didn't
write this.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.080
"I've never been good
with words,

22:18.104 --> 22:21.205
"and don't really know why I
signed up in the first place.

22:21.307 --> 22:23.708
"Martha somehow convinced me.

22:23.810 --> 22:26.143
"She said that Christmas
is a magical time of year,

22:26.245 --> 22:29.847
"and anything is possible
if we truly believe.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.960
"I think that I could use a
little bit of Christmas magic

22:31.984 --> 22:33.551
"these days.

22:33.653 --> 22:36.554
"Look forward to hearing
from you. Hutch."

22:38.424 --> 22:39.924
So?

22:40.026 --> 22:42.360
He spelled "believe" wrong.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.294
What kind of a person
doesn't know

22:43.396 --> 22:44.573
that it's "i before e,
except after c?"

22:44.597 --> 22:46.030
This was such a bad idea.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.965
Give him a break, Judge Judy.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.934
No one is perfect.

22:50.036 --> 22:50.735
What about you, dad?

22:50.837 --> 22:51.502
How was your letter?

22:51.604 --> 22:52.370
She sounds very interesting.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.905
She has recently
taken up painting.

22:56.342 --> 22:58.287
I mean honestly, did Martha
set me up with a second grader?

22:58.311 --> 22:59.810
Give it a chance, Hannah.

22:59.912 --> 23:02.279
You never know what surprises
will come out of this.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.882
Spellcheck was invented
for a reason.

23:29.876 --> 23:30.876
Honey!

23:32.044 --> 23:33.544
Are you okay, Aunt Hannah?

23:33.646 --> 23:35.846
Yep, good, just figuring it out.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.115
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.517
Welcome, welcome!

23:39.619 --> 23:41.352
I'm so glad you came.

23:41.454 --> 23:42.520
Thanks, Martha.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.655
Hannah! Are you okay?

23:44.757 --> 23:45.757
Fine!

23:45.858 --> 23:46.624
Fine. Good.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.493
Look! It's the Mayor.
Have fun!

23:49.595 --> 23:51.629
Well, if it isn't
the Morris gang!

23:51.731 --> 23:53.364
What a pleasant surprise!

23:53.466 --> 23:54.932
Susan, great to see ya.

23:55.034 --> 23:55.866
Hey, Susan.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.035
Hannah, I haven't seen
you for years.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.838
You are looking more
and more like your mother!

24:00.940 --> 24:03.207
She was a little bit better
on skates.

24:04.177 --> 24:05.042
Isn't this great?

24:05.144 --> 24:07.278
I swear, the whole town is here.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.425
Martha, she sure knows how
to bring people together.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.080
<i>Does she ever!</i>

24:10.183 --> 24:11.882
<i>This is really something.</i>

24:11.984 --> 24:12.683
<i>How are the kids?</i>

24:12.785 --> 24:13.851
They're great.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.864
Nicole is in Mexico with
her family for the holidays,

24:15.888 --> 24:18.589
and Simon is still finishing up
his degree in France.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.356
Fantastic.

24:19.459 --> 24:21.592
You must be proud!

24:21.694 --> 24:24.929
I should really introduce you
to the ladies from my book club.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.297
<i>They are gonna be so excited</i>

24:26.399 --> 24:28.699
<i>that you signed up
for Christmas Cupid.</i>

24:28.801 --> 24:30.501
What'd I tell ya?

24:30.603 --> 24:32.080
They're just over there, on
the other side of the rink.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.437
Okay. I'll meet you over there.

24:33.539 --> 24:34.817
I'm just waiting for Hannah,
here.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.185
No, no, no. I'm fine,
I'm fine! You go!

24:36.209 --> 24:36.841
I'll... I'll catch up.

24:36.943 --> 24:37.641
Are you sure, Honey?

24:37.743 --> 24:40.311
Yes! Go, go.
Get outta here.

24:40.413 --> 24:41.545
Get outta here.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.280
Okay.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.885
Okay... I'll just... go...

24:49.722 --> 24:51.222
I can do this.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.692
Yeah. I got this,
I got...

24:54.794 --> 24:55.926
Ouch!

24:59.932 --> 25:02.266
Hannah Morris on skates.

25:02.368 --> 25:04.068
I never thought I'd see the day.

25:04.170 --> 25:05.703
Sam.

25:05.805 --> 25:06.837
What are you doing here?

25:06.939 --> 25:09.106
Don't tell me you signed up
for Christmas Cupid.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.510
I'm just serving hot chocolate
as a favour for Martha.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.244
Okay.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.513
Did... you sign up?

25:15.615 --> 25:18.215
I... I'm doing it
for research.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.519
Plus, also, my dad refused
to do it unless I did, so...

25:22.421 --> 25:23.654
Yeah.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.100
I can't imagine having to write
a new letter every other day

25:25.124 --> 25:26.557
for the next two weeks.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.391
Sounds...

25:27.493 --> 25:28.125
Stressful.

25:28.227 --> 25:29.059
What are you talking about?

25:29.161 --> 25:30.995
You used to be a great
letter writer.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.429
Back in the day.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.965
I think I still have a few
of those, somewhere.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.145
Well, I knew extortion was
somewhere in my future.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.671
So, who do you think he is?

25:40.773 --> 25:42.840
I don't know.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.219
Honestly, I wish I hadn't
signed up.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.754
I just want the next two weeks,
and Christmas,

25:45.778 --> 25:48.145
and anything to do with it
over with.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.127
That does not sound like
the same girl

25:50.182 --> 25:51.582
that once dragged me carolling

25:51.684 --> 25:54.952
while wearing a lit-up
Christmas sweater.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.220
Well...

25:56.322 --> 25:59.156
You know, some things change.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.927
I'm gonna go check
on my dad and Max.

26:04.530 --> 26:05.796
See you later!

26:05.898 --> 26:06.697
Try to have fun.

26:06.799 --> 26:07.799
Okay!

26:10.603 --> 26:11.502
Sh-

26:11.604 --> 26:12.970
Hannah!

26:13.072 --> 26:14.082
- You okay?
- You okay?

26:14.106 --> 26:16.740
That was a hard fall.

26:16.842 --> 26:20.244
Here, let me help you up.

26:20.346 --> 26:21.011
Thank you.

26:21.113 --> 26:21.579
Ouch.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.347
That's a good one.

26:23.449 --> 26:24.214
Yeah.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.116
Is she okay, Dan?

26:26.218 --> 26:26.951
You two know each other?

26:27.053 --> 26:27.651
Yeah.

26:27.753 --> 26:28.852
I'm a regular at the cafe.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.422
Hey, hey, Sam, would you mind
finding us a bandage?

26:31.524 --> 26:32.957
Thank you...

26:33.059 --> 26:34.503
I'm Daniel Harrison, by the way.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.726
Local MD.

26:35.828 --> 26:36.860
And you are?

26:36.963 --> 26:38.262
I'm, Hannah Morris.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.998
Local... figure skating champ.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.780
I will be signing
autographs later.

26:42.868 --> 26:43.908
In case you're interested!

26:44.971 --> 26:46.136
Well, Hannah Morris,

26:46.238 --> 26:48.283
you might wanna think about
taking some skating lessons.

26:48.307 --> 26:49.440
Doctor's orders.

26:50.543 --> 26:52.020
You must be the new doctor
that told my dad

26:52.044 --> 26:53.944
to stop drinking coffee.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.046
What, Ted?

26:55.114 --> 26:56.114
Yeah!

26:56.182 --> 26:57.948
Guilty as charged.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.651
I... I just moved here a few
months back from Chicago.

27:00.753 --> 27:02.497
Took over Doctor Tucker's
practice.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.154
Chicago?

27:04.256 --> 27:06.490
It's kind of a small town
for a big city guy.

27:06.592 --> 27:08.837
Well, my sister and her husband
live here, so it makes sense.

27:08.861 --> 27:10.728
Get to see my niece
anytime I want, now.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.507
It's nice to be close to family.

27:12.531 --> 27:13.797
But with how much I work,

27:13.899 --> 27:15.811
I don't really get a chance to
meet anyone outside the office.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.669
Which is why I signed up
for Christmas Cupid.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.070
You signed up for this?

27:20.172 --> 27:22.039
Yeah! Why do you think
I'm here?

27:22.141 --> 27:24.108
I don't know, for like...

27:24.210 --> 27:25.776
ice skating Emergencies?

27:25.878 --> 27:28.178
Technically, I'm supposed
to be off duty.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.813
Sorry about that.

27:31.550 --> 27:32.550
Here you go.

27:32.585 --> 27:33.384
Thanks Sam.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.452
Perfect.

27:35.554 --> 27:36.898
Actually, I'm pretty excited
about it.

27:36.922 --> 27:39.923
It's such a unique way to meet
someone new.

27:40.026 --> 27:42.359
Secretly, I can't wait
'til she writes me back.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.439
I dropped my first letter off
last night.

27:44.463 --> 27:47.031
Really? I just got my first
letter this morning.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.336
I should get back to the stand.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.438
What?

27:54.106 --> 27:54.805
Yeah, okay.

27:54.907 --> 27:55.673
Great.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.708
Thank you!

27:58.477 --> 27:59.521
Looks like you're gonna be okay.

27:59.545 --> 28:00.778
Okay.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.880
Thank you.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.247
Hannah!

28:03.349 --> 28:04.048
Sarah?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.983
Sarah! Hi!

28:06.085 --> 28:08.152
It's been so long!

28:08.254 --> 28:09.053
Are you okay?

28:09.155 --> 28:10.799
I saw you fall from across
the rink!

28:10.823 --> 28:12.868
Yeah, well, thanks to Doctor
Harrison over here,

28:12.892 --> 28:14.324
I think I'm gonna live.

28:14.427 --> 28:15.993
Daniel is a lifesaver.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.596
Sarah and I went
to high school together.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.065
I haven't seen you since...

28:21.167 --> 28:21.832
When?

28:21.934 --> 28:23.167
My 21st birthday bash.

28:24.437 --> 28:26.370
I think I should let you
two catch up.

28:26.472 --> 28:27.783
It was really nice to meet you,
Hannah.

28:27.807 --> 28:28.472
You too.

28:28.574 --> 28:29.339
Put ice on that tonight, okay?

28:29.442 --> 28:30.140
Okay!

28:30.242 --> 28:31.542
Got it.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.615
Isn't he great?

28:38.718 --> 28:41.218
I have never been so grateful
to be so bad at skating

28:41.320 --> 28:43.454
in my entire life.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.955
How are you?
How are you?

28:45.057 --> 28:45.823
What's been going on?

28:45.925 --> 28:47.391
Good! Good.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.593
I moved back here
a few years ago,

28:49.695 --> 28:51.335
got a job teaching fourth grade.

28:52.598 --> 28:53.997
Yeah, Max is in my class!

28:54.100 --> 28:54.798
What?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.767
Yeah, but, okay, how about you?

28:56.869 --> 28:58.013
Sounds like you've been busy
hanging out

28:58.037 --> 28:59.403
with Mark Zuckerberg?

29:00.106 --> 29:01.171
And doing TED talks?

29:01.941 --> 29:04.007
Your life sounds amazing.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.444
I actually went on a few dates

29:07.546 --> 29:09.124
with a guy that I met
on Perfect One.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.247
Really?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.983
Yeah, it's just, you know,
it didn't really work out.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.996
Like, it... We didn't really
have that...

29:15.020 --> 29:16.687
Spark?

29:16.789 --> 29:17.387
Exactly.

29:17.490 --> 29:18.789
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:18.891 --> 29:19.891
Yeah.

29:19.992 --> 29:21.232
I'm excited about this, though.

29:22.061 --> 29:22.893
Yeah, I've skated around
the rink five times already.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.062
Trying to see who my pen pal
could be!

29:25.164 --> 29:26.675
Do you really think it's
possible to fall in love

29:26.699 --> 29:29.633
through a letter
with a total stranger?

29:29.735 --> 29:30.868
Why not?

29:30.970 --> 29:33.410
It's like Martha said: "anything
can happen at Christmas."

29:33.506 --> 29:35.339
Even falling in love.

29:35.741 --> 29:36.940
Oh. Okay.

29:45.785 --> 29:48.852
<i>Dear Hutch, thank you
for your letter.</i>

29:48.954 --> 29:51.922
<i>Like you, I thought about
not going through with this.</i>

29:52.024 --> 29:55.092
<i>Sometimes the Christmas season
can be hard for me.</i>

29:55.194 --> 29:57.361
<i>It used to be my favourite time
of year,</i>

29:57.463 --> 30:00.497
<i>especially decorating the tree
with my family.</i>

30:00.599 --> 30:02.199
<i>But now, things are different.</i>

30:02.301 --> 30:03.867
<i>Really different.</i>

30:03.969 --> 30:06.270
<i>We don't even have
a tree this year.</i>

30:06.372 --> 30:11.809
<i>However, I'm beginning to wonder
if perhaps Martha is right.</i>

30:11.911 --> 30:14.077
<i>Maybe there is still
some Christmas magic</i>

30:14.180 --> 30:16.747
<i>left to be found.</i>

30:16.849 --> 30:18.916
<i>I just don't know where to look.</i>

30:19.018 --> 30:21.251
<i>Any suggestions?</i>

30:21.353 --> 30:23.153
<i>Look forward to your reply.</i>

30:23.255 --> 30:24.888
<i>Stardust.</i>

30:27.092 --> 30:27.724
<i>Finally!</i>

30:27.827 --> 30:29.026
<i>Hey, Naomi.</i>

30:29.128 --> 30:30.806
Yeah, sorry, I've been trying
to stay on top of my emails,

30:30.830 --> 30:32.574
but my dad just gave up
his WiFi.

30:32.598 --> 30:33.964
So, how is everything?

30:34.066 --> 30:35.677
Our numbers are still continuing
to dip.

30:35.701 --> 30:38.502
We lost 3,000 users
just this week alone.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.838
<i>Our... our investors are
threatening to pull out.</i>

30:40.940 --> 30:42.539
You've gotta be kidding me!

30:42.641 --> 30:43.641
How long do we have?

30:43.742 --> 30:45.320
<i>If we don't have a solution
by the new year,</i>

30:45.344 --> 30:47.110
it's bad, Hannah.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.815
<i>Have any brilliant ideas landed
in your lap?</i>

30:52.284 --> 30:55.719
Not unless you consider a letter
from a stranger "brilliant."

30:55.821 --> 30:56.821
<i>Come again?</i>

30:56.889 --> 30:59.890
I signed up for my hometown's
Christmas Cupid,

30:59.992 --> 31:02.226
which is this old tradition
from the '40s

31:02.328 --> 31:04.272
where people are matched
with anonymous pen pals

31:04.296 --> 31:06.208
in the hopes of finding
friendship or falling in love.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.275
It's all pretty ridiculous,

31:07.299 --> 31:08.977
but I thought it might be good
for research.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.133
Sounds fascinating.

31:10.236 --> 31:11.835
I... I'm intrigued.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.070
Is it working?

31:13.172 --> 31:15.450
Well, I don't really even know
anything about the guy.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.443
But I am holding his second
letter in my hand as we speak.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.312
Well, open it!
Read what it says.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.081
<i>I don't know.</i>

31:24.183 --> 31:25.282
Come on.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.017
Okay, all right.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.086
Okay. All right.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.689
Okay.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.059
Here goes.

31:36.161 --> 31:37.461
"Dear Stardust"

31:37.563 --> 31:40.364
That's my pen name.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.432
"I understand what
you're feeling.

31:42.534 --> 31:45.168
<i>"Sometimes we romanticize
our past so much</i>

31:45.271 --> 31:47.337
<i>"that we can't enjoy
the present.</i>

31:47.439 --> 31:49.206
"So let's try to change that.

31:49.308 --> 31:52.643
"I challenge you to get a
Christmas tree and decorate it

31:52.745 --> 31:55.345
"with your loved ones,
whoever they are.

31:55.447 --> 31:56.758
"It might feel different
than it did before,

31:56.782 --> 31:58.815
"but maybe somewhere
in that old tradition,

31:58.918 --> 32:00.984
"Christmas magic still lives."

32:02.922 --> 32:04.054
He sounds so sweet!

32:04.156 --> 32:06.123
So, when you gonna go?

32:06.225 --> 32:07.291
Go where?

32:07.393 --> 32:08.692
To get a tree?

32:08.794 --> 32:10.327
No, I don't know.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.696
It's a... it's a nice thought,
but I'm...

32:12.798 --> 32:13.864
<i>But what?</i>

32:13.966 --> 32:16.800
This Christmas pen pal cupid
whatever thing may be

32:16.902 --> 32:19.102
just the inspiration
you've been needing.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.437
<i>You gotta go with it.</i>

32:20.539 --> 32:21.571
Okay.

32:21.674 --> 32:23.273
Okay.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.876
But I have to wait 'til my dad
gets home from work.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.544
Unless...

32:29.348 --> 32:31.281
Unless I surprise him with one.

32:31.383 --> 32:33.483
Now you're thinking.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.392
Hannah Morris?

32:42.494 --> 32:43.627
Greg.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.395
Greg Williams, hey!

32:46.532 --> 32:48.076
If it isn't the high school
valedictorian

32:48.100 --> 32:49.766
before my very eyes.

32:49.868 --> 32:50.634
How are you?

32:50.736 --> 32:51.746
I didn't know you
still lived here.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.481
I am actually just in town
for the holidays.

32:53.505 --> 32:54.505
I live in New York now.

32:54.540 --> 32:55.540
Really?

32:55.574 --> 32:57.052
Yeah. I work at Frank and Oak
Real Estate.

32:57.076 --> 32:58.453
You're looking at one of
the top ten

32:58.477 --> 33:00.143
real estate agents in the city!

33:00.245 --> 33:01.245
That's very impressive.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.347
Thank you.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.892
I thought I saw you
at the skating rink.

33:03.916 --> 33:04.748
Wait.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.361
You signed up for
Christmas Cupid too?

33:06.385 --> 33:08.051
Yeah. Mrs. Monroe...

33:08.153 --> 33:08.552
Martha.

33:08.654 --> 33:09.453
Martha, right.

33:09.555 --> 33:10.555
Martha.

33:10.656 --> 33:11.700
She basically forced me to
when I ran into her.

33:11.724 --> 33:12.856
Yeah, sounds about right.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.725
Listen, I mean, I gotta run.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.338
Do you... do you want to grab
a cup of coffee

33:16.362 --> 33:18.139
while we're both in town
and catch up?

33:18.163 --> 33:18.762
Sure.

33:18.864 --> 33:19.730
Great.

33:19.832 --> 33:20.832
Call me.

33:20.866 --> 33:21.398
Okay!

33:21.500 --> 33:22.500
All right.

33:22.901 --> 33:24.668
- See ya.
- See ya.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.075
Okay. Tree, tree.

33:42.554 --> 33:44.921
Yeah. This is the one.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.860
Hi!

33:49.962 --> 33:51.495
Hi. Excuse me?

33:51.597 --> 33:52.674
Can... can I get this tree?

33:52.698 --> 33:53.830
Sure.

33:53.932 --> 33:54.976
You just use one of the carts
over there and bring it

33:55.000 --> 33:56.366
to your vehicle.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.234
Wait, you don't...

33:57.336 --> 33:58.535
You don't deliver?

33:58.637 --> 34:00.604
Good one.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.009
Thanks, Julie.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.289
Say, Sam, when are you gonna get
some new options in this place?

34:08.313 --> 34:10.847
I'd pay good money for
a pumpkin spice latte.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.293
Yeah, that must take
a lot of courage,

34:12.317 --> 34:13.717
to say that out loud.

34:13.819 --> 34:17.154
Trust me, Mike, I've been
telling him that for months.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.255
What's the saying?

34:18.290 --> 34:20.168
"Stubborn as a mule"
or "dumb as a doorknob?"

34:20.192 --> 34:21.858
I think they both work.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.260
You still on for hockey tonight?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.094
Starts at 7:00.
Don't be late.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.097
I'll be there when I get there.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.034
Hey Spencer, what's up?

34:31.136 --> 34:31.935
Hey Julie.

34:32.036 --> 34:33.136
I'm good, how are you?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.871
I'm-

34:34.973 --> 34:35.806
I...
I mean, not much.

34:35.908 --> 34:37.574
Not much. Not much is up.

34:37.676 --> 34:38.475
I'm good.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.976
Are... are you good?

34:40.079 --> 34:41.344
I... I'm... I'm good.

34:41.447 --> 34:42.447
Good. Good.

34:42.547 --> 34:43.547
Good, good, good, good.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.862
Did you want anything, or?

34:47.886 --> 34:48.318
Yeah.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.252
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

34:49.353 --> 34:50.853
I'll... I'll take that.

34:50.956 --> 34:52.989
The pink butterfly cupcake?

34:53.092 --> 34:54.252
Yup.

34:54.326 --> 34:56.193
It's for my sister.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.295
You have a sister?

34:58.397 --> 34:59.397
How much would that be?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.897
$3.00.

35:00.999 --> 35:01.598
Okay.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.399
Well, hey.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.501
Keep the change.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.602
Thanks.

35:04.803 --> 35:05.902
Okay.

35:06.004 --> 35:06.803
Good.

35:06.905 --> 35:07.437
Okay.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.539
Bye.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.612
He has a serious crush on you.

35:15.714 --> 35:16.746
Who? Spencer?

35:16.849 --> 35:18.281
He's just awkward.

35:18.383 --> 35:19.216
No way.

35:19.318 --> 35:21.038
I know someone who
was just like him.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.086
You?

35:22.154 --> 35:23.320
Almost passed out every time

35:23.422 --> 35:24.732
I tried to talk to the girl
I liked.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.501
I ended up having to stick
a note in her locker

35:26.525 --> 35:28.825
in 11th grade, just to ask her
to a movie.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.427
Did she go out with you?

35:30.529 --> 35:31.928
Quite a few times.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.830
We ended up dating
for almost four years.

35:33.932 --> 35:34.998
Four years?

35:35.968 --> 35:37.145
How have you never told me this?

35:37.169 --> 35:39.636
The point is, don't be so quick
to brush him aside.

35:39.738 --> 35:40.403
Who was she?

35:40.506 --> 35:41.516
Forget it, you're not listening.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.372
Someone I know?

35:42.474 --> 35:43.106
Stop.

35:43.208 --> 35:44.908
Was she pretty?

35:45.010 --> 35:46.476
She was-

35:46.578 --> 35:47.578
Hannah!

35:48.514 --> 35:50.013
It was Hannah?

35:50.115 --> 35:53.016
Would you go fill
some mugs or something?

35:54.153 --> 35:56.052
Large coffee, black.

35:56.155 --> 35:57.155
Should I even ask?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.802
I was trying to surprise my dad
with a Christmas tree,

36:00.826 --> 36:02.559
but I don't have a car.

36:02.661 --> 36:03.793
It was the perfect tree.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.028
No, it's on the house.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.563
Thanks.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.899
I... have my truck.

36:09.001 --> 36:09.900
I could take you.

36:10.002 --> 36:11.234
Seriously?

36:11.336 --> 36:12.736
Wait, now?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.504
As opposed to?

36:14.606 --> 36:15.672
Aren't you working?

36:15.774 --> 36:16.606
You know, Julie's here.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.708
Hey Julie?

36:17.776 --> 36:18.608
Yes?

36:18.710 --> 36:19.576
Can you hold down the fort
for a bit?

36:19.678 --> 36:20.922
I'm gonna help Hannah
with something.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.045
As you wish.

36:22.147 --> 36:24.125
Ooh, could you drop off
my Christmas Cupid letter

36:24.149 --> 36:24.781
on your way?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.049
Fine.

36:26.151 --> 36:27.151
Are you sure?

36:27.219 --> 36:28.396
Well, you can't give up
on the perfect tree

36:28.420 --> 36:30.031
just because of a bump
in the road.

36:30.055 --> 36:32.015
Now, let's go before I change
my mind.

36:32.090 --> 36:33.657
You too.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.462
Looks great.

36:39.565 --> 36:40.864
You picked a beauty.

36:40.966 --> 36:43.567
My dad is gonna be so excited.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.035
Thank you so much, Sam.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.781
I could not have done this
without you.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.471
I owe you one.

36:48.574 --> 36:52.275
How about one of your
mom's famous apple pies?

36:52.377 --> 36:55.745
I think I could find
that recipe somewhere.

37:00.219 --> 37:02.919
Never in a million years did I
think that when I came home,

37:03.021 --> 37:04.454
I'd be buying a Christmas tree,

37:04.556 --> 37:08.091
or writing to a Christmas
pen pal.

37:08.193 --> 37:09.960
How's that going, by the way?

37:10.062 --> 37:11.902
He seems really... sweet,
actually.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.775
It feels like he's listening
to me.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.543
Says the girl who wished
she never signed up?

37:15.567 --> 37:17.500
Yeah, well, I'm trying
to give it a chance.

37:17.603 --> 37:19.069
Well, don't get too excited.

37:19.171 --> 37:20.348
You could be writin'
to Principal Cullen

37:20.372 --> 37:21.671
for all you know.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.672
I saw him at the rink.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.774
What? That's so gross!

37:24.876 --> 37:25.954
Remember how much nose hair
he had?

37:25.978 --> 37:26.810
Yes!

37:26.912 --> 37:27.611
And how it connected
to his moustache?

37:27.713 --> 37:28.778
Yes!

37:28.880 --> 37:31.114
Well, it still does, but...
Hey, maybe he's the one.

37:31.216 --> 37:33.817
Love knows no bounds, after all.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.752
It "nose" no bounds.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.198
Okay, that's just
a terrible joke.

37:37.222 --> 37:38.922
You should never say that again.

37:39.024 --> 37:39.889
Can you...

37:39.992 --> 37:42.759
You know, you need to stop!
Right now.

37:42.861 --> 37:44.060
<i>Forget I mentioned it.</i>

37:44.162 --> 37:45.562
Hey!

37:45.664 --> 37:47.497
Is that Sam I see?

37:47.599 --> 37:49.399
What a surprise!

37:49.501 --> 37:50.333
Ted.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.602
A tree!

37:52.704 --> 37:54.404
It's the perfect tree!

37:54.506 --> 37:57.140
Well, you know, I figured we
hadn't decorated in a long time.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.242
I thought maybe we could
do it tonight.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.278
Unless you threw out
all the decorations.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.712
Threw out?

38:02.814 --> 38:03.880
I don't think so.

38:03.982 --> 38:07.183
Come on, Max,
let's go find them.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.354
Well, I should get going.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.222
Yeah.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.068
Hey, thanks again for today,
Sam.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.925
Glad I could help.

38:19.197 --> 38:22.832
Sam, you should come back later
to decorate with us.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.467
Yeah? I...
I don't know...

38:24.569 --> 38:26.569
He did help bring it in.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.082
Only seems right
that you should get

38:28.106 --> 38:30.240
to help decorate it, too.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.811
I mean, unless you're too much
of a Scrooge to participate

38:34.913 --> 38:37.480
in something so merry and jolly.

38:40.452 --> 38:42.585
<i>Alright, count me in.</i>

38:46.525 --> 38:48.491
This might be our best
tree ever!

38:49.861 --> 38:52.181
It definitely beats the year
a live squirrel jumped out.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.110
It practically gave mom
a heart attack.

38:54.166 --> 38:55.632
Just like that movie.

38:55.734 --> 38:56.978
We had to chase it around
the house.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.134
We?

38:58.236 --> 38:59.903
I think you mean Sam.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.639
He chased that thing with an old
pot and saved the day!

39:03.508 --> 39:04.207
Come on.

39:04.309 --> 39:05.141
It's a true story.

39:05.243 --> 39:06.788
We have to give Joe
some credit here.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.089
He screamed every time
that thing ran by,

39:08.113 --> 39:09.633
so at least I knew
where it was, right?

39:10.849 --> 39:11.849
You're my hero.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.883
Why thank you!

39:15.187 --> 39:16.786
It really is perfect.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.456
Not yet. We're missing the star!

39:19.558 --> 39:21.624
Would you like to do
the honours, Mr. Max?

39:21.727 --> 39:23.159
<i>Really? Cool!</i>

39:23.261 --> 39:24.094
Come on, Joe.

39:24.196 --> 39:25.907
Give me a hand with this guy,
here.

39:25.931 --> 39:26.663
All right, ready?

39:26.765 --> 39:28.698
One, two, up we go!

39:30.168 --> 39:30.834
<i>Good guy!</i>

39:30.936 --> 39:33.069
<i>All right, you got it, man.</i>

39:42.748 --> 39:43.748
Hannah?

39:43.782 --> 39:44.881
Are you okay?

39:44.983 --> 39:46.983
Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.485
What's wrong?

39:48.587 --> 39:49.753
It's nothing.

39:49.855 --> 39:52.989
It's... it's stupid.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.059
Is this about Max putting
the star on top of the tree?

39:56.161 --> 39:59.162
I know that used to be
your mom's job.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.765
You remember that?

40:01.867 --> 40:05.735
She is hard to forget.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.370
It just doesn't...

40:07.472 --> 40:10.373
It doesn't feel right
without her.

40:10.475 --> 40:14.043
This whole Christmas season
just makes me miss her more

40:14.146 --> 40:15.211
than I can bear.

40:15.313 --> 40:17.113
It's too much.

40:21.153 --> 40:25.088
You know, the way I see it,
continuing old traditions

40:25.190 --> 40:26.234
you used to do with your mom

40:26.258 --> 40:28.691
will only help keep her alive
in your heart.

40:28.794 --> 40:30.238
Just because you added a twist
to the tradition,

40:30.262 --> 40:32.595
it doesn't erase the past.

40:32.697 --> 40:34.509
She would love to see Max
putting the star

40:34.533 --> 40:35.533
on top of that tree.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.080
It would break her heart
to see you avoiding

40:39.104 --> 40:43.440
the Christmas season just
because she isn't here.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.074
I know.

40:45.177 --> 40:46.776
I know, you're right.

40:49.214 --> 40:51.714
I just thought that I would be
over this by now.

40:51.817 --> 40:53.283
It's been so many years.

40:53.385 --> 40:56.753
I'm just tired of feeling sad.

40:56.855 --> 40:59.489
Well, sometimes it doesn't
matter how much time goes by.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.225
We can still miss someone
with our whole heart.

41:02.327 --> 41:04.327
And that's okay.

41:04.429 --> 41:07.430
It just means we love
them fully.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.602
When did you get so smart?

41:14.673 --> 41:17.607
I know what it's like
to miss someone.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.484
Come see the tree,
it's all done!

41:20.512 --> 41:22.479
Come on!

41:34.259 --> 41:35.736
Okay, I promised your mom
we were just looking today,

41:35.760 --> 41:39.162
so don't try to trick me
into buying you anything.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.264
Hey, look, it's Doctor Harrison!

41:41.366 --> 41:42.366
Hey!

41:42.434 --> 41:44.479
Well, if it isn't my favourite
figure skater?

41:46.037 --> 41:46.836
How's the wrist?

41:46.938 --> 41:47.804
It's good, it's good.

41:47.906 --> 41:48.738
Thanks for asking.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.706
Good.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.252
Hey, Max, good to see
you again, buddy!

41:51.276 --> 41:52.842
This is Lizzie, my niece.

41:52.944 --> 41:53.944
Hey, Lizzie!

41:54.012 --> 41:56.112
Did you find anything
interesting in here yet?

41:56.214 --> 41:56.913
I'll show you!

41:57.015 --> 41:58.414
Come on!

42:01.620 --> 42:02.652
I miss it sometimes.

42:02.754 --> 42:04.866
Just being a kid, getting
so excited by everything.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.222
And what made a nine-year-old

42:06.324 --> 42:08.391
Doctor Harrison fill up
with excitement?

42:08.493 --> 42:10.460
Dreaming of becoming a doctor.

42:10.562 --> 42:11.794
Really?

42:11.897 --> 42:13.374
You... you knew you wanted to be
a doctor from the age of nine?

42:13.398 --> 42:15.198
I was six, actually.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.433
I guess I just always knew
what I wanted.

42:17.536 --> 42:20.703
I... I think that's an
incredible quality to have.

42:20.805 --> 42:22.216
Did you accomplish everything?

42:22.240 --> 42:23.006
Almost.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.185
There's just one thing left.

42:24.209 --> 42:25.209
Yeah, what's that?

42:25.310 --> 42:26.476
To find someone.

42:26.578 --> 42:27.677
The one.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.490
And, if Martha is as good
a cupid as she says she is,

42:29.514 --> 42:30.947
I think it's my pen pal.

42:31.049 --> 42:32.126
I've got a good feeling
about it.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.216
Really?

42:33.318 --> 42:35.429
Even though you have no idea
who you're writing to?

42:35.453 --> 42:36.319
Who knows?

42:36.421 --> 42:37.901
Maybe she's standing right
next to me.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.228
Hannah.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.696
Hey, Martha.

42:46.798 --> 42:49.866
Or, should I say, Stardust?

42:49.968 --> 42:51.367
How can I help ya?

42:51.469 --> 42:53.503
I just came by for some stamps.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.872
How's it going with your
Christmas pen pal so far?

42:55.974 --> 42:57.173
You happy you signed up?

42:57.275 --> 42:59.409
Yeah, he seems great.

42:59.511 --> 43:01.522
I just... can't really wrap
my brain around

43:01.546 --> 43:03.758
the whole concept of falling
in love through letters.

43:03.782 --> 43:05.949
It seems a little far-fetched.

43:06.051 --> 43:06.849
How come?

43:06.952 --> 43:09.085
Anything's possible
at Christmas.

43:09.187 --> 43:13.890
Plus, look at all the couples
that ended up together in 1945.

43:13.992 --> 43:19.095
I found this digging through
the archives at the library.

43:23.134 --> 43:24.612
"Margaret James and Thomas Floyd

43:24.636 --> 43:29.372
"married three months
after Christmas Cupid."

43:31.443 --> 43:34.210
"Jill Hartwick
and Hal Bradford."

43:37.515 --> 43:40.550
These are... these are
my mom's parents!

43:40.652 --> 43:41.818
You're kidding?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.831
"The two began writing right
before Hal went off to war,

43:43.855 --> 43:45.099
"and it wasn't until
the following Christmas

43:45.123 --> 43:48.925
"when he was discharged that
they finally met in person.

43:49.027 --> 43:51.995
"They married two weeks later
and quickly became pregnant

43:52.097 --> 43:55.465
"with their only daughter."

43:55.567 --> 43:57.000
That's my mom!

43:57.102 --> 43:58.635
This, this is incredible.

43:58.737 --> 44:01.838
I wouldn't even be here if
it weren't for Christmas Cupid.

44:01.940 --> 44:02.739
I told you.

44:02.841 --> 44:05.675
Writing letters is magical.

44:08.446 --> 44:09.512
So, hold on.

44:09.614 --> 44:11.325
First, you didn't even want
to sign up.

44:11.349 --> 44:12.582
And now you're telling me

44:12.684 --> 44:14.495
that you think he could be
your soulmate?

44:14.519 --> 44:16.352
Do you have any idea
who it could be?

44:16.454 --> 44:18.621
No! I have no idea.

44:18.723 --> 44:20.356
It could be Doctor Daniel.

44:20.458 --> 44:21.502
Or maybe even Greg Williams.

44:21.526 --> 44:23.537
Did I tell you I ran into him
the other day?

44:23.561 --> 44:25.995
Apparently, he's
very successful.

44:26.097 --> 44:28.017
And you know how I love
a good work ethic.

44:29.300 --> 44:30.867
Mail!

44:30.969 --> 44:32.201
Ooh!

44:37.809 --> 44:39.342
Okay.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.009
Okay.

44:40.111 --> 44:41.111
Here, here!

44:41.680 --> 44:42.680
Well, what does it say?

44:42.747 --> 44:44.947
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

44:47.118 --> 44:49.886
"Dear Stardust, to help you
on your quest to finding

44:49.988 --> 44:54.057
"the magic of Christmas again,
I've drawn you a special map.

44:54.159 --> 44:55.525
"If followed correctly,

44:55.627 --> 44:57.405
"you will find a Christmas
treasure at the end.

44:57.429 --> 44:58.939
"Can't wait to read
your next letter.

44:58.963 --> 45:01.397
"Thinking of you often."

45:04.703 --> 45:06.169
<i>He drew you a map?</i>

45:06.271 --> 45:07.570
<i>He drew me a map!</i>

45:09.974 --> 45:11.585
I think we're supposed to go
through the gate.

45:11.609 --> 45:12.942
Okay, if you say so.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.255
'Cause we just came
through here.

45:14.279 --> 45:14.677
Okay.

45:14.779 --> 45:15.344
Excellent.

45:15.447 --> 45:15.945
You go.

45:16.047 --> 45:16.646
You go!

45:16.748 --> 45:17.346
You go!

45:17.449 --> 45:19.449
Okay. Okay.

45:19.551 --> 45:20.450
Okay.

45:20.552 --> 45:21.762
Okay, I think we just keep
going down this-

45:21.786 --> 45:23.564
This guy better not be the
Zodiac Killer or something.

45:23.588 --> 45:25.354
Don't say that,
he's not the Zodiac!

45:25.457 --> 45:27.390
You don't know that!

45:28.259 --> 45:29.425
Hannah!

45:29.527 --> 45:30.893
Look!

45:32.964 --> 45:33.964
Okay!

45:35.834 --> 45:38.101
What am I supposed
to be looking for?

45:38.203 --> 45:39.235
There's an arrow!

45:39.938 --> 45:41.437
No, no, no!

45:41.539 --> 45:43.506
I'm not putting my hand
in there.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.641
Hang on.

45:45.744 --> 45:47.276
I think I feel something.

45:47.378 --> 45:48.277
Oh god.

45:48.379 --> 45:49.990
Please don't be someone's
big toe inside.

45:50.014 --> 45:50.847
Stop it!

45:50.949 --> 45:52.482
Okay.

45:52.584 --> 45:53.983
Please, please, please.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.586
Okay.

45:57.956 --> 45:58.788
Here.

45:58.890 --> 46:00.323
It's so cute!

46:13.605 --> 46:15.916
"Found these at an antique store
and thought of you.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.140
"I can't explain why.

46:17.242 --> 46:19.742
"Apparently, they are over 60
years old and were inspired

46:19.844 --> 46:22.779
"by a wonderful old book called
The Christmas Star."

46:25.183 --> 46:28.684
"I hope you
like them. Hutch."

46:28.787 --> 46:30.331
Did you tell him about the book?

46:30.355 --> 46:31.355
No!

46:35.593 --> 46:37.760
God, I think I just felt it!

46:37.862 --> 46:39.228
What?

46:39.330 --> 46:41.731
The spark!

46:50.441 --> 46:52.141
<i>Dear Hutch.</i>

46:52.243 --> 46:55.578
<i>What you did for me today
meant so much.</i>

46:55.680 --> 46:58.347
<i>More than you could
possibly understand.</i>

46:58.449 --> 47:00.161
<i>I will forever cherish
those earrings,</i>

47:00.185 --> 47:01.684
<i>and whenever I wear them,</i>

47:01.786 --> 47:05.454
<i>I will remember the feeling
that you gave me today.</i>

47:05.557 --> 47:07.857
<i>Thank you.</i>

47:07.959 --> 47:10.860
<i>You are more than I could have
wished for.</i>

47:40.158 --> 47:41.724
What are you doing up so late?

47:41.826 --> 47:44.327
Making Christmas Cupid cookies.

47:44.429 --> 47:45.862
Christmas Cupid cookies?

47:45.964 --> 47:47.196
Who blackmailed you?

47:47.298 --> 47:49.643
Well, since everyone in town
was participating in the thing,

47:49.667 --> 47:52.134
I figured it would be good
for business.

47:52.237 --> 47:54.804
Which... I could use right
about now.

47:55.707 --> 47:58.307
I can relate to that.

47:58.409 --> 47:59.409
Really?

48:00.011 --> 48:01.011
Your company, it...

48:01.079 --> 48:03.479
Yeah. We've been taking a turn
for the worse.

48:03.581 --> 48:05.593
I may be back to waitressing,
come New Years'.

48:05.617 --> 48:06.382
Yeah.

48:06.484 --> 48:08.028
Hey, I've heard the tips
are great.

48:10.755 --> 48:14.824
Have you ever, like, thought
about getting WiFi in here?

48:14.926 --> 48:17.204
Or, you know, like setting up
a rewards point program

48:17.228 --> 48:19.206
to give customers incentives
to keep coming back?

48:19.230 --> 48:20.230
No way!

48:20.298 --> 48:22.376
This place would lose its soul
with that stuff.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.477
You know, someone
once told me that just

48:23.501 --> 48:25.835
'cause you add a new twist
to an old tradition

48:25.937 --> 48:28.337
doesn't mean you're erasing
the past.

48:28.439 --> 48:29.439
Really?

48:29.974 --> 48:32.041
Kay, well, he sounds like
a doofus.

48:32.143 --> 48:34.510
A... a doofus? Really?

48:34.612 --> 48:36.190
Yeah, that's a...
That's a thing I say.

48:36.214 --> 48:37.013
It's a good word.

48:37.115 --> 48:38.759
More grown men should use
that word.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.350
Right.

48:41.452 --> 48:42.752
These look amazing.

48:42.854 --> 48:44.665
Yeah, I just need to finish
with the icing now.

48:44.689 --> 48:47.290
Well, put me to work.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.191
Okay. Be my guest.

48:49.294 --> 48:50.294
Great.

48:56.768 --> 48:58.801
They are so delicious.

48:58.903 --> 48:59.635
Thank you.

48:59.737 --> 49:00.803
And thanks for helping.

49:01.806 --> 49:02.605
It's actually an old
family recipe.

49:02.707 --> 49:04.974
I just added marshmallow
for texture.

49:05.076 --> 49:07.743
Wait, so like, you added
something new

49:07.845 --> 49:10.780
into an old recipe,
and it made it better?

49:10.882 --> 49:12.548
That's so weird!

49:12.650 --> 49:14.917
Okay. Okay. Look, I get
your point.

49:15.853 --> 49:16.864
I just don't want to see
this cafe

49:16.888 --> 49:18.254
turn into some hipster place

49:18.356 --> 49:20.000
where everyone's wearing
their headphones,

49:20.024 --> 49:21.201
and they're more focused
on their apps

49:21.225 --> 49:24.226
than they are on each other,
you know?

49:24.329 --> 49:25.127
Yeah.

49:25.229 --> 49:26.507
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean that.

49:26.531 --> 49:26.996
No, no, no, no, no.

49:27.098 --> 49:28.597
It's totally fine.

49:28.700 --> 49:31.500
I am starting to understand
the importance of really...

49:31.602 --> 49:34.337
really connecting with people,
face to face.

49:34.439 --> 49:35.916
Instead of, just...
you know?

49:35.940 --> 49:36.940
Through our devices.

49:36.975 --> 49:38.819
But I do think that technology
can do a lot

49:38.843 --> 49:40.309
to bring people together.

49:40.411 --> 49:41.844
Yeah. That's totally true.

49:41.946 --> 49:44.313
I mean, what would we do
without viral cat videos?

49:44.415 --> 49:45.147
I don't even know.

49:45.249 --> 49:46.249
I don't know either.

49:51.656 --> 49:54.290
So, you have anyone
in your life these days?

49:54.392 --> 49:55.758
Sort of.

49:55.860 --> 49:58.527
I'm... I'm getting to know
someone, but... yeah.

49:58.629 --> 50:00.162
It's nothing serious.

50:00.264 --> 50:01.264
Anyone I know?

50:01.366 --> 50:02.832
I doubt it.

50:02.934 --> 50:04.633
Look, it's... it's complicated.

50:05.737 --> 50:09.972
Um, anyway, how's your
Christmas pen pal?

50:10.074 --> 50:14.243
He's actually...
pretty amazing.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.479
Wait... are you falling
for this guy?

50:16.581 --> 50:19.181
I don't know.

50:19.283 --> 50:20.416
Maybe?

50:20.518 --> 50:21.518
I think so, I don't know.

50:21.619 --> 50:22.619
Look.

50:22.687 --> 50:23.886
Remember what I said?

50:23.988 --> 50:25.799
Don't get your expectations
too high.

50:25.823 --> 50:27.101
I'd hate to see you get
let down.

50:27.125 --> 50:29.959
He's already surpassed
my expectations.

50:30.061 --> 50:33.295
He's helping me understand what
I used to love about Christmas.

50:33.398 --> 50:35.631
I haven't enjoyed this time
of year since...

50:37.035 --> 50:38.768
Since my mom died.

50:42.540 --> 50:45.374
Must be midnight.

50:45.476 --> 50:46.108
I better go.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.144
Yeah.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.450
Goodnight, Sam.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.352
'Night.

51:00.992 --> 51:02.058
Hannah?

51:02.160 --> 51:03.392
Yeah?

51:07.298 --> 51:11.634
You still owe me
your mom's apple pie.

51:11.736 --> 51:13.903
Right.

51:23.815 --> 51:25.214
One at a time, folks!

51:25.316 --> 51:26.182
One at a time!

51:26.284 --> 51:27.861
Let's keep the casualties
to a minimum.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.452
This isn't Black Friday!

51:34.625 --> 51:35.791
Hannah!

51:35.893 --> 51:37.660
Hey, Sarah!

51:37.762 --> 51:38.762
This is insane.

51:38.830 --> 51:39.962
People are really into this!

51:40.064 --> 51:40.796
No kidding!

51:40.898 --> 51:41.697
Between you and me,

51:41.799 --> 51:44.400
I kinda think my guy
might be Daniel.

51:44.502 --> 51:46.502
He is a hot commodity
around here.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.604
Who are you hoping for?

51:48.706 --> 51:50.539
I want it to be Sam.

51:50.641 --> 51:51.540
Sam?

51:51.642 --> 51:53.109
He's not doing it.

51:53.211 --> 51:54.443
But he was at the ice rink.

51:54.545 --> 51:56.857
He was selling hot chocolate,
but he never actually signed up.

51:56.881 --> 51:57.881
Sorry.

51:59.884 --> 52:00.916
But, you know,

52:01.018 --> 52:03.098
that shouldn't stop you
from getting to know him.

52:03.154 --> 52:04.164
I mean, just 'cause he's not
your pen pal

52:04.188 --> 52:08.724
doesn't mean you can't, like,
ask him out.

52:08.826 --> 52:10.159
Really?

52:10.261 --> 52:10.993
Yeah.

52:11.095 --> 52:12.428
You wouldn't mind?

52:12.530 --> 52:14.196
What? No!

52:14.298 --> 52:16.632
No, we're like, ancient history.

52:16.734 --> 52:18.634
Cool!

52:18.736 --> 52:19.401
Thanks Hannah.

52:19.504 --> 52:20.836
Sure! I'll talk to you later.

52:20.938 --> 52:22.538
'Kay.

52:37.788 --> 52:40.289
Hey, Jeff, how's it going?

52:40.391 --> 52:41.924
Daniel!

52:42.026 --> 52:43.192
Hannah!

52:43.294 --> 52:44.193
What a nice surprise!

52:44.295 --> 52:45.194
What are you doing here?

52:45.296 --> 52:46.707
I was just out shopping,
I saw you come in,

52:46.731 --> 52:48.264
I thought I'd come say hi.

52:48.366 --> 52:49.366
I'm glad you did.

52:49.467 --> 52:50.566
Please, take a seat.

52:52.136 --> 52:53.213
I'll take your coat for you.

52:53.237 --> 52:53.969
Thank you.

52:54.071 --> 52:54.904
How's your wrist?

52:55.006 --> 52:56.972
Much better, thanks.

53:01.746 --> 53:03.546
Yeah. It's so funny
you're here,

53:03.648 --> 53:05.481
I was just thinkin' about you.

53:05.583 --> 53:06.815
Really?

53:06.918 --> 53:10.119
Yeah, this whole Christmas Cupid
thing just has my head spinning.

53:10.221 --> 53:12.254
Yeah, you're not the only one.

53:12.356 --> 53:13.734
And, I was thinking about how...

53:15.526 --> 53:16.725
Hold that thought.

53:16.827 --> 53:17.626
The pager.

53:17.728 --> 53:20.329
Okay.

53:20.431 --> 53:22.164
Ahh, shoot.

53:22.266 --> 53:24.567
I... I'm sorry, I gotta go.

53:24.669 --> 53:25.534
Work calls.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.281
We'll finish this
conversation soon, okay?

53:27.305 --> 53:28.437
Sure.

53:28.539 --> 53:29.205
It was nice to see you.

53:29.307 --> 53:30.139
You too.

53:30.241 --> 53:31.774
As short as it was.

53:45.590 --> 53:46.188
<i>Oh my gosh!</i>

53:46.290 --> 53:47.890
So, Sam shoots the 8 ball,

53:47.992 --> 53:49.269
it bounces off of
the pool table,

53:49.293 --> 53:51.694
and smacks me right
in the mouth.

53:51.796 --> 53:52.494
I lose two teeth!

53:52.597 --> 53:53.429
No!

53:53.531 --> 53:54.997
It was hilarious.

53:55.099 --> 53:57.077
One time when I was in college,
we were playing pool,

53:57.101 --> 53:59.768
and Sam actually broke
the TV with a cue.

53:59.870 --> 54:00.936
No, no, not the pool cue.

54:01.038 --> 54:02.249
It was actually the cue ball,
right off the break,

54:02.273 --> 54:03.939
just Bam!

54:04.041 --> 54:06.108
Remind me to never play
pool with him.

54:06.210 --> 54:07.109
You want another drink?

54:07.211 --> 54:10.346
You gonna leave me
with these two clowns?

54:10.448 --> 54:11.647
Yeah, good point.

54:11.749 --> 54:12.381
Come with me.

54:12.483 --> 54:13.483
Okay.

54:14.318 --> 54:16.118
Can we get another round,
please?

54:17.688 --> 54:19.021
This is fun.

54:19.123 --> 54:19.922
Yeah.

54:20.024 --> 54:21.602
I'm... I'm really glad
you're here.

54:21.626 --> 54:22.424
Me too.

54:22.526 --> 54:23.359
<i>Hey Sam!</i>

54:23.461 --> 54:24.593
What?

54:27.431 --> 54:28.664
Would you look at that?

54:29.700 --> 54:30.866
<i>Kiss her!</i>

54:30.968 --> 54:31.634
What?

54:31.736 --> 54:33.202
What are we, in seventh grade?

54:33.304 --> 54:35.771
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!

54:35.873 --> 54:38.207
<i>Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!</i>

54:38.309 --> 54:39.541
<i>Kiss her! Kiss her!</i>

54:39.644 --> 54:41.744
It's just a kiss, right?

54:41.846 --> 54:42.611
Yeah, right.

54:42.713 --> 54:45.481
Right. Okay.

54:45.583 --> 54:48.117
<i>Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!</i>

54:48.219 --> 54:50.319
<i>Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!</i>

55:11.842 --> 55:13.742
Thank you.

55:17.248 --> 55:19.248
The cookies sold well yesterday.

55:19.350 --> 55:20.149
I saw that.

55:20.251 --> 55:21.417
I'll have to tell Hannah.

55:21.519 --> 55:23.252
She helped me out
with the icing.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.020
Hannah?

55:25.122 --> 55:26.188
When?

55:26.290 --> 55:27.701
A few nights ago, she popped in.

55:27.725 --> 55:28.757
Ooh la la!

55:30.628 --> 55:31.628
No.

55:32.263 --> 55:32.928
It's not like that.

55:33.030 --> 55:33.929
We're just old friends.

55:34.031 --> 55:34.897
Come on.

55:34.999 --> 55:35.999
You can tell me.

55:36.067 --> 55:37.399
I can keep a secret.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.101
There's nothing to tell.

55:39.203 --> 55:42.705
Besides, she's this big city
tech whiz now.

55:42.807 --> 55:44.340
Sam, you own a business.

55:44.442 --> 55:46.542
That's... that's a big deal.

55:46.644 --> 55:49.144
On top of that, you can cook
and bake?

55:49.246 --> 55:52.548
Any woman would be lucky
to date you.

55:52.650 --> 55:53.682
Okay.

55:53.784 --> 55:55.951
Now I know you've lost it.

55:57.521 --> 56:00.756
Well, hey Sarah,
what can I get you?

56:00.858 --> 56:02.658
I'm not here for coffee,
actually.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.393
Oh really?

56:04.495 --> 56:06.228
Can I help you with something?

56:06.330 --> 56:07.096
Well.

56:07.198 --> 56:08.630
I was talking to Hannah.

56:08.733 --> 56:11.467
I had mentioned to her
that I was interested

56:11.569 --> 56:13.135
in getting to know you better,

56:13.237 --> 56:16.872
and, she encouraged me
to ask you out sometime.

56:16.974 --> 56:19.007
Hannah told you to ask me out?

56:19.110 --> 56:21.221
I was thinking maybe we could
grab a drink tonight

56:21.245 --> 56:24.046
at Winston's?

56:25.416 --> 56:27.583
It's... it's okay
if you... don't.

56:27.685 --> 56:28.685
No, no, no!

56:28.719 --> 56:30.439
The cafe doesn't close
'til 9:30.

56:30.488 --> 56:32.128
And then I have to count the...

56:32.156 --> 56:33.655
I...

56:33.758 --> 56:36.225
I'm... I'm closing tonight.
Remember, Sam?

56:37.962 --> 56:39.928
He would love to go out tonight.

56:42.199 --> 56:43.199
Really?

56:45.936 --> 56:48.537
What time can I pick you up?

56:57.548 --> 56:58.280
Hey guys!

56:58.382 --> 57:00.582
Hi! Hi! Hi!

57:00.684 --> 57:01.784
Hi!

57:01.886 --> 57:03.218
How do you spell "triceratops?"

57:05.923 --> 57:06.822
You know what?

57:06.924 --> 57:09.158
Just sound it out and see
where you land.

57:10.027 --> 57:11.171
I'm gonna get the dictionary.

57:11.195 --> 57:13.295
This needs to be perfect.

57:15.166 --> 57:16.743
He seems to be enjoying
his pen pal.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.600
What are you doing here?

57:18.702 --> 57:20.714
Do you think it's cheating if
you're forming a relationship

57:20.738 --> 57:21.782
with someone you've never met,

57:21.806 --> 57:23.884
but then you accidentally kiss
someone else?

57:23.908 --> 57:24.740
What?

57:24.842 --> 57:26.341
Who did you kiss?

57:26.444 --> 57:27.309
Kinda...

57:27.411 --> 57:28.777
Sorta...

57:28.879 --> 57:30.212
Sam?

57:30.314 --> 57:31.547
What?!

57:31.649 --> 57:32.414
How did this happen?

57:32.516 --> 57:33.248
Sit down!

57:33.350 --> 57:34.950
Tell me!

57:35.052 --> 57:36.663
I went to the bar to spend time
with Daniel,

57:36.687 --> 57:38.165
but then he had to go,
so then I wound up

57:38.189 --> 57:40.133
with Sam and his friends,
and there was this whole,

57:40.157 --> 57:43.525
like, mistletoe situation
and it all happened so fast.

57:43.627 --> 57:45.294
It didn't mean anything.

57:45.396 --> 57:46.261
Are you sure?

57:46.363 --> 57:47.729
Yes! I'm sure, yeah.

57:47.832 --> 57:48.730
Plus, I'm really trying

57:48.833 --> 57:51.467
to give my Christmas pen pal
a shot here.

57:51.569 --> 57:54.937
I am just worried that Sam might
think that it meant something.

57:55.039 --> 57:56.917
I do owe him one of mom's
apple pies,

57:56.941 --> 57:58.618
so I'll make a pie,
I'll bring it over,

57:58.642 --> 58:00.442
we'll have a talk.

58:00.544 --> 58:01.910
Do you want the recipe?

58:02.012 --> 58:02.578
Yeah.

58:02.680 --> 58:03.545
Yeah! Do you have it?

58:03.647 --> 58:04.947
Yeah. It's in the cupboard.

58:05.049 --> 58:07.716
In mom's old recipe book.

58:12.957 --> 58:14.756
Hey, Julie, is Sam here?

58:14.859 --> 58:17.626
Sorry, he left early
to go out tonight.

58:17.728 --> 58:18.728
Go out?

58:19.296 --> 58:20.307
Where? With who...
with who?

58:20.331 --> 58:21.331
With Sarah.

58:21.398 --> 58:22.531
They're going to Winston's!

58:22.633 --> 58:24.700
Sarah?

58:24.802 --> 58:26.668
She didn't waste any time.

58:26.770 --> 58:28.537
Are you okay?

58:28.639 --> 58:30.405
Yeah. I'm fine.

58:30.508 --> 58:31.206
I'm good.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.007
<i>Yeah.</i>

58:32.109 --> 58:33.509
I brought this for Sam,

58:33.611 --> 58:35.388
but I can bring it back
another time.

58:35.412 --> 58:36.445
It's fine.

58:36.547 --> 58:37.579
Not necessary.

58:37.681 --> 58:38.721
I can just give it to him.

58:38.782 --> 58:40.215
Oh... 'Kay.

58:40.317 --> 58:41.016
Ooh!

58:41.118 --> 58:41.783
Thank you.

58:41.886 --> 58:43.118
That... works too.

58:45.823 --> 58:46.823
Hannah!

58:46.857 --> 58:48.490
Hi, Greg!

58:48.592 --> 58:49.970
I was gonna get a cup of coffee.

58:49.994 --> 58:52.828
You want to join me?

58:52.930 --> 58:54.530
Yes. Yes.

58:54.632 --> 58:56.532
I would... I would love to.

58:56.634 --> 58:58.111
But I, you know, actually,
I'm just thinking,

58:58.135 --> 58:59.179
it's kind of late for coffee.

58:59.203 --> 59:01.281
You want to go to Winston's
and grab a drink?

59:01.305 --> 59:02.204
Absolutely.

59:02.306 --> 59:02.871
Great.

59:02.973 --> 59:03.372
To Winston's.

59:03.474 --> 59:04.474
Okay.

59:12.049 --> 59:13.115
Hi.

59:13.217 --> 59:14.082
Welcome to Winston's.

59:14.184 --> 59:14.750
How many?

59:14.852 --> 59:15.517
Just two.

59:15.619 --> 59:17.319
The wait will be over an hour.

59:17.421 --> 59:19.388
Hannah! Greg!

59:19.490 --> 59:20.389
Hey!

59:20.491 --> 59:21.356
Look who it is.

59:21.458 --> 59:23.125
What are the odds?

59:23.227 --> 59:24.804
What are you two
doing here together?

59:24.828 --> 59:25.839
Well, we were hoping
to have a drink,

59:25.863 --> 59:27.563
but the wait is over an hour!

59:27.665 --> 59:29.097
Do you guys wanna join us?

59:29.199 --> 59:30.544
We could pull up
two extra seats.

59:30.568 --> 59:31.568
Oh, no.

59:31.602 --> 59:32.234
I'm sure they'd rather have
their own table.

59:32.336 --> 59:34.036
That would be great, thanks.

59:38.542 --> 59:40.253
So then, I get an offer
on the apartment.

59:40.277 --> 59:42.778
It's insanely over asking price,
and you'll never guess

59:42.880 --> 59:44.580
who the buyer was.

59:44.682 --> 59:45.814
Jimmy Fallon.

59:45.916 --> 59:46.949
No way!

59:47.051 --> 59:47.950
I love him.

59:48.052 --> 59:49.618
He's great.
He's great.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.431
Really shy, if you can
believe it.

59:51.455 --> 59:52.688
Say, Sam!

59:52.790 --> 59:54.367
What've you been up to
all these years?

59:54.391 --> 59:56.658
Well, I stayed here to work
after high school,

59:56.760 --> 59:58.493
as Eddie's apprentice
at the cafe.

59:58.596 --> 01:00:00.276
I started managing
the place at 26,

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:01.997
and eventually, I bought it.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.165
Isn't that amazing?

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.466
Thank you.

01:00:04.568 --> 01:00:06.401
I was laying down roots.

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:08.103
<i>Let's get another bottle.</i>

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:09.805
I'll be right back.

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.217
<i>Could we just get one more,
please?</i>

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.841
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.043
Excuse me.

01:00:29.393 --> 01:00:31.293
Are you okay?

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:33.228
I'm just getting some fresh air.

01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:35.497
Why are you here with Greg?

01:00:35.599 --> 01:00:37.466
Why are you here with Sarah?

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:39.835
I don't know, you tell me.

01:00:39.937 --> 01:00:41.970
I thought you were dating
someone else.

01:00:42.072 --> 01:00:44.206
Like I said, it's complicated.

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:45.474
Why does it matter to you?

01:00:45.576 --> 01:00:46.208
It doesn't.

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:46.975
Really?

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.077
Seems like it does.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:51.647
I just... I can't keep bumping
into my past.

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:52.381
It needs to stop.

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:53.782
I gotta focus on my future.

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:55.362
With Greg and the big shot
Williams?

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:56.518
With my pen pal, okay?

01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:57.386
Whether it's Greg or not.

01:00:57.488 --> 01:00:59.032
I just, I need to give it
a shot.

01:00:59.056 --> 01:00:59.788
With your pen pal.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:01.256
Yes.

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:03.558
Okay.

01:01:03.661 --> 01:01:06.228
So what are you saying, exactly?

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:09.131
I'm saying I... I can't be
around you, all right?

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.566
And why is that?

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:12.968
You know why.

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.436
No.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:15.749
I really don't.
Tell me.

01:01:15.773 --> 01:01:16.505
You don't know why.

01:01:16.607 --> 01:01:18.573
No. I don't know why,
Hannah.

01:01:18.676 --> 01:01:19.474
So why don't you tell me?

01:01:19.576 --> 01:01:21.843
I'm here, right now,
in front of you.

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:24.112
You just, you walked out
of my dorm room that night,

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:26.048
and you never came back.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.294
You made it very clear that
you didn't want me around.

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:30.786
I didn't know what I wanted.

01:01:30.888 --> 01:01:31.888
My mom was dying.

01:01:31.989 --> 01:01:34.356
I... I needed you.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.991
I'm not a mind reader.

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:38.138
You said you wanted to be alone
and I respected that.

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:39.494
What was I supposed to do?

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:42.130
It doesn't even matter anymore.

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:44.700
You should probably
just get back inside.

01:01:53.243 --> 01:01:57.145
You think it's easy for me
to see you?

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:59.014
That it's only hard for you?

01:02:25.809 --> 01:02:27.109
You're up late.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.644
I went to a movie with a lady
from Susan's book club,

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:30.912
Cheryl.

01:02:31.014 --> 01:02:32.981
A date!

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.650
How'd that go?

01:02:35.753 --> 01:02:39.221
It felt a bit forced,
truthfully.

01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:42.758
Well, maybe if you keep trying
it'll feel right?

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.694
I don't think
that's how it works.

01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:52.634
Is everything alright?

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:53.502
No.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:54.604
Maybe.

01:02:54.671 --> 01:02:56.104
I don't know.

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:58.039
What's on your mind, kiddo?

01:02:58.142 --> 01:02:59.841
Okay.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.377
When I signed up for
this Christmas Cupid thing,

01:03:02.479 --> 01:03:05.113
I wasn't just doing it
for research.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:10.018
I was doing it because I wanted
you to find someone.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.454
I was worried that you seemed
lonely and isolated,

01:03:12.556 --> 01:03:17.859
and that you'd never get over
your heartbreak over mom.

01:03:17.961 --> 01:03:20.201
And now I'm realizing that
this whole time I've really,

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:23.298
pretty much just been
describing myself.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.868
This about your pen pal?

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.105
He seems... perfect.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:32.407
He's kind and thoughtful,

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:34.287
and there's something
about the way that he writes.

01:03:34.311 --> 01:03:38.213
I feel like, I... I don't know,
I feel like he understands me.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:42.117
I think he could maybe
be the one.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:43.451
So, what's the problem?

01:03:43.554 --> 01:03:44.631
Well, I mean, besides the fact

01:03:44.655 --> 01:03:47.289
that I still have
no idea who he is.

01:03:47.391 --> 01:03:49.271
I'm still thinking about
someone else,

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:53.161
and I can't shake it.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.596
Sam?

01:03:54.698 --> 01:03:55.764
Is it that obvious?

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:59.000
It is to your old dad.

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:02.204
Love isn't rational,
my dear, it's magical.

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:05.307
You'll figure it out.

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.409
How'd you know mom was the one?

01:04:07.511 --> 01:04:12.948
Well, I think I knew for sure
when we were out for dinner,

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:17.953
and I was so nervous...
I started to stutter.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.658
She reached across the table,
put her hand on mine.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.361
It was like a jolt
of electricity, a spark.

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:29.064
Suddenly, my stutter went away.

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:31.867
And I knew right then and there
that everything would be okay,

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:34.769
as long...

01:04:37.574 --> 01:04:40.976
As long as I had her by my side.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:47.515
Do you ever think that...

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:49.784
you could have that spark
with someone else?

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:53.021
No one will ever replace
your mother, Hannah.

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.056
But if this Christmas Cupid
experience

01:04:55.158 --> 01:04:56.391
has taught me anything,

01:04:56.493 --> 01:05:00.762
it's that it's... it's okay
to move forward.

01:05:00.864 --> 01:05:02.342
To feel something
for someone again.

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:06.935
Nothing would make
your mother... happier.

01:05:07.037 --> 01:05:10.005
It's so hard to let go
of the past.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:14.743
Well, maybe... maybe it's not
about letting go entirely,

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:22.845
but maybe not holding on
quite so tight.

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:29.291
I'm really sorry I've avoided
coming home as much as I have.

01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:33.862
Sometimes the memories
were just too much.

01:05:33.964 --> 01:05:37.098
I really miss being home.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.336
You're here now,
that's what counts.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:42.470
Okay.

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:45.507
Here.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:46.808
Gimme some of that.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:47.943
All right.

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:58.153
Good.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.690
I second that.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.960
<i>I can't believe Sam said that.</i>

01:06:05.062 --> 01:06:08.563
I said some pretty harsh things,
too.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:10.043
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:11.911
I had a doctor's appointment
this morning,

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:12.968
and guess what?

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:14.536
What?

01:06:14.638 --> 01:06:18.106
Doctor Daniel told me that he
hopes that you are his pen pal.

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:19.074
Really?

01:06:19.176 --> 01:06:20.442
A doctor for a brother-in-law?

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:22.978
I could get on board with that.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Look, it's a flyer from Martha!

01:06:25.182 --> 01:06:26.748
Here. Come here bud.

01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:27.850
What does it say?

01:06:27.951 --> 01:06:30.452
"Dear Christmas Cupid
participants.

01:06:30.554 --> 01:06:32.854
"This is a reminder to write
your final letters

01:06:32.956 --> 01:06:35.957
"to your pen pals before you
find out who they are.

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:39.094
"Include how you plan
to reveal yourselves.

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:43.264
"Looking forward to a night of
serendipity on Christmas Eve!

01:06:43.367 --> 01:06:45.600
"Martha Matchmaker."

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:51.506
Okay! Thanks!

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.641
Susan! Happy almost
Christmas Eve.

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:54.609
Ted. Thank you.

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:55.711
You too!

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:57.123
What are your plans
for the big day?

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:59.192
Since Paul passed away
and the kids aren't here,

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:02.217
I'm just in a house by myself.

01:07:02.319 --> 01:07:05.020
Why don't you come have
Christmas dinner with us?

01:07:05.122 --> 01:07:07.000
I don't want to impose
on your family, I...

01:07:07.024 --> 01:07:08.024
No, no.

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.024
No imposition.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:10.126
I promise.

01:07:11.695 --> 01:07:12.894
You know what?

01:07:12.996 --> 01:07:14.562
That would be great.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:15.664
Thank you.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:19.734
How was the date with Cheryl?

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.756
Oh, goodness, that woman
is a chatterbox.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.806
I hardly said a word.

01:07:24.908 --> 01:07:26.841
I should have warned you
about that.

01:07:26.943 --> 01:07:27.709
Bye.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:29.778
Bye!

01:07:37.487 --> 01:07:38.353
You're late.

01:07:38.455 --> 01:07:39.554
By one minute.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:41.489
You're still late.

01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:43.058
Since when do you care?

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.526
Since now.

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:45.860
You're grumpy.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:47.162
Why are you grumpy?

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:48.930
I'm not grumpy.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:51.332
Okay... Fine.

01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:57.338
Hannah came by and dropped
this off for you.

01:07:57.441 --> 01:07:59.474
I don't want it.
Throw it out.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.076
What? Throw it out?

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:02.178
Yeah. Now. Gone.

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:04.145
Capiche?

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:07.449
Okay. Look, I might have only
just turned 20,

01:08:07.551 --> 01:08:09.818
but I know what's going on here.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.587
You're in love with her.

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:13.888
I beg your pardon?

01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:17.325
Hannah? You love her.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:20.428
Stop trying to deny it.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:23.331
I can see it.

01:08:23.433 --> 01:08:24.933
Sam.

01:08:25.035 --> 01:08:27.734
You have to tell her.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:33.341
<i>Dear Hutch, I can't believe</i>

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:35.944
<i>it's almost Christmas
Eve already.</i>

01:08:36.046 --> 01:08:38.379
<i>Strangely enough, I wish
it was further away</i>

01:08:38.482 --> 01:08:40.982
<i>so we could keep writing
one another.</i>

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:44.519
<i>Your letters have meant more to
me than I ever thought possible.</i>

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.821
<i>You've helped me realize
that it's time I moved on</i>

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:50.859
<i>from the past, and really let
myself see a future.</i>

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:54.895
<i>I haven't told you yet why
I chose the name Stardust.</i>

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:57.564
<i>When I was growing up, every
single year on Christmas Eve,</i>

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.827
<i>my mom would read the book
"The Christmas Star"</i>

01:08:59.870 --> 01:09:01.736
<i>to me and my sister.</i>

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.037
<i>Yeah. The same book
that the earrings</i>

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.640
<i>you found for me
were designed after.</i>

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:08.743
<i>Pretty serendipitous, huh?</i>

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:11.145
<i>It's this beautiful old book
from the '40s,</i>

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:13.126
<i>and sadly, ever since
she passed away,</i>

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.050
<i>we haven't been able to find
our copy anywhere.</i>

01:09:16.153 --> 01:09:19.554
<i>Anyway, my mom would always
tell me that every time</i>

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.957
<i>I look into the sky
and see a shining star,</i>

01:09:23.059 --> 01:09:26.394
<i>it is a reminder
that she is with me.</i>

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:28.962
<i>I can't wait to finally
meet you.</i>

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.977
<i>I'll be wearing the Christmas
Star earrings,</i>

01:09:31.001 --> 01:09:33.501
<i>eagerly searching the room
for you.</i>

01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:36.770
<i>And, if I forget to say it
at the festival,</i>

01:09:36.872 --> 01:09:39.340
<i>thank you for everything.</i>

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:41.475
<i>Your pen pal.</i>

01:09:41.578 --> 01:09:43.444
It's Hannah.

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:51.386
<i>I told you I was not good
with words.</i>

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:53.499
<i>The idea of writing to someone
in the hopes of finding love</i>

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:58.026
<i>sounded ridiculous,
but I'm so happy I did.</i>

01:09:58.128 --> 01:10:00.628
<i>I feel deeply connected to you
and this whole process</i>

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:04.632
<i>has made me realize how
closed off I was to the world.</i>

01:10:04.734 --> 01:10:07.302
<i>Thank you for opening my eyes.</i>

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:10.038
<i>No matter what happens
after tomorrow night,</i>

01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:12.006
<i>know that you mean
so much to me,</i>

01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:14.342
<i>and that I care for you deeply.</i>

01:10:14.444 --> 01:10:16.377
<i>I'll be the one holding a book.</i>

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:19.013
<i>With love, Hutch.</i>

01:10:25.622 --> 01:10:26.902
I can't believe how nervous
I am.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:29.924
What if it's Principal Cullen?

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:31.559
Stop!

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:34.996
Martha wouldn't do that to you.

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:37.131
I wonder why his name is Hutch.

01:10:37.234 --> 01:10:39.467
You can find out tonight!

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:43.115
I'm just so glad that I
don't have to see Sam tonight.

01:10:43.139 --> 01:10:46.007
The last time we saw each other
was so bad.

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:47.520
Why are you thinking about Sam

01:10:47.544 --> 01:10:49.777
the night that you might meet
your soulmate?

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:53.147
I know, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

01:10:53.250 --> 01:10:54.749
Hey, speaking of soulmates?

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:57.819
I told Naomi that I think
Christmas Cupid is,

01:10:57.921 --> 01:10:59.732
it just might be the fix that
we've been looking for.

01:10:59.756 --> 01:11:01.089
Really? How?

01:11:01.191 --> 01:11:03.424
By matching people
with a pen pal.

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:04.425
She loved the idea.

01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:07.362
We're gonna call it
"Perfect Pen Pals."

01:11:07.464 --> 01:11:09.464
I love it! It's great!

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:19.274
You look great, Aunt Hannah.

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:21.409
Your pen pal is one lucky guy.

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:23.678
You are absolutely beautiful.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.658
Your mom's dress looks perfect
on you.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.148
Thank you, dad.

01:11:27.250 --> 01:11:30.218
You look so handsome.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.654
Are you ready to go find
your spark?

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.522
I'm ready.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:41.797
Let's take a picture!

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:10.124
Sam in a suit?

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:12.460
What are you doing here?

01:12:12.562 --> 01:12:13.562
Did you sign up?

01:12:14.731 --> 01:12:17.465
I can't believe you signed up
and you never told me.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:18.567
It's Hannah.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:19.367
What?

01:12:19.469 --> 01:12:20.902
My pen pal is Hannah.

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:22.303
Are you serious?

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:23.938
This is crazy.

01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:24.739
It's like fate.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.441
I know.

01:12:26.543 --> 01:12:29.510
How do I look?

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:33.548
Okay, yeah. Perfect.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:34.315
Really?

01:12:34.417 --> 01:12:37.085
Definitely, she's gonna love it.

01:12:37.187 --> 01:12:38.286
Surprise.

01:12:38.388 --> 01:12:40.021
Oh my gosh, Spencer?

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:41.522
It's been you this whole time?

01:12:41.624 --> 01:12:43.391
I... I can't believe it.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:44.359
Are you disappointed?

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:46.627
No. No, of course not.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:47.428
Let's dance.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:48.262
Okay.

01:12:48.365 --> 01:12:50.031
Good luck, Sam!

01:13:00.877 --> 01:13:03.411
I really hope Hannah
is my pen pal.

01:13:03.513 --> 01:13:05.473
I had a huge crush on her
in high school.

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:07.548
I think now could finally be
my chance.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.761
Well, I wouldn't get
your hopes up too high,

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:11.686
because Daniel and Hannah
are basically spoken for.

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:14.188
They are both convinced
they are each other's pen pals.

01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:15.990
Really? The doctor?

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:17.670
Hannah thinks they could even
be soulmates.

01:13:17.694 --> 01:13:19.794
She's totally smitten.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.863
I feel bad for Sam, though.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.931
<i>I think he's still hung up
on her,</i>

01:13:24.033 --> 01:13:25.767
<i>after all these years.</i>

01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:28.136
<i>He needs to get over it already.</i>

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:29.103
Move on.

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:32.206
She's a tech mogul
for crying out loud.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:38.746
Hey, Sam.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:39.580
What are you doing here?

01:13:39.682 --> 01:13:42.216
I just came here
to give you this.

01:13:42.318 --> 01:13:43.584
What's this?

01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:44.986
It's Hannah's.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:46.832
Martha told me
that you two are pen pals

01:13:46.856 --> 01:13:48.496
and she left it
at the post office.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:49.802
Could you give that back to her?

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:52.493
No way. She's my pen pal?

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:53.895
That is amazing!

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:55.029
I was hoping it was her.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.442
I... I'll definitely give this
to her.

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:57.031
Thank you.

01:13:57.133 --> 01:13:58.133
Hey, Sam.

01:13:58.168 --> 01:13:59.500
I think she's the one.

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:01.269
I really do.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.838
Isn't that crazy?

01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:06.541
Yeah, well, she's one of
the most amazing people

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:09.143
I've ever known, so...
be good to her.

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:11.412
Of course.

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:22.590
Sam!

01:14:22.692 --> 01:14:25.026
What are you... what are you
doing here?

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.295
Martha, wanted my help
with something,

01:14:27.397 --> 01:14:29.497
but I'm... just leaving.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:30.398
Have a great night.

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:34.202
Is that... is that...
is that it?

01:14:36.072 --> 01:14:38.406
What do you want me to say?

01:14:38.508 --> 01:14:42.410
I don't... I don't know.

01:14:42.512 --> 01:14:46.314
Look, I thought about
what you said the other night.

01:14:46.416 --> 01:14:48.449
And I think you're right.

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:51.519
I think it's time to move on
from the past.

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:57.191
You look beautiful.

01:14:57.293 --> 01:14:58.526
Thank you.

01:14:58.628 --> 01:14:59.628
Yeah.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:13.809
Bing.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.479
Susan, you're Comet?

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:20.515
I was hoping it was you.

01:15:20.617 --> 01:15:24.452
To be honest, I was wishing
for you too.

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:25.686
May I?

01:15:28.791 --> 01:15:31.192
Susan, would you like to dance?

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:32.994
Yes, I'd love to.

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:43.070
Lizzie?

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:44.338
Max!

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.673
Are you Dial?

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:47.108
You're Skywalker?

01:15:49.812 --> 01:15:50.812
Come on!

01:15:55.985 --> 01:15:57.451
Looking for someone?

01:15:57.554 --> 01:15:58.619
Daniel.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:01.556
I believe this is for you.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:09.230
I'm...

01:16:09.332 --> 01:16:10.464
I, I just...

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:13.935
I... I can't believe
it's really you!

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:16.437
Do you want to go somewhere
where it's quiet?

01:16:16.539 --> 01:16:18.105
Yes. Yes!

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:24.023
Can you give me a minute?

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.157
Yeah, I'll just go grab
our coats.

01:16:25.181 --> 01:16:26.747
Okay.

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:28.849
Sarah?

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:31.185
What are you doing sitting here
all by yourself?

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:33.321
My pen pal isn't here.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:34.755
I think he stood me up.

01:16:34.857 --> 01:16:36.657
What?

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.360
I'm sure he'll come.
Just give it time.

01:16:39.462 --> 01:16:43.598
Well, I'm only gonna stay a
little longer before I leave.

01:16:46.135 --> 01:16:48.436
One sec...
one sec.

01:16:49.606 --> 01:16:50.916
So you were right,

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.240
Yeah, I guess I was.

01:16:53.343 --> 01:16:56.043
He's waiting for you. Go.

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:56.811
Are you sure?

01:16:56.913 --> 01:16:58.713
Yeah. I'll be fine.

01:16:58.815 --> 01:17:00.147
Okay.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:13.594
Do you want my coat?

01:17:13.696 --> 01:17:15.029
No, I'm actually fine.

01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:16.831
Thank you.

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:25.106
It's funny.

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.843
We had so much to say in
our letters and now it's...

01:17:28.945 --> 01:17:30.544
hard to find the words.

01:17:30.647 --> 01:17:32.179
I know.

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:33.648
It's weird.

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:40.655
You know, I think I know
what might break the ice.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:44.492
Wait.

01:17:44.594 --> 01:17:48.095
I'm sorry, I, I... I don't think
I can do this.

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:49.730
Are you not happy it's me?

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:52.867
No, I am, I... I wanted it to be
you more than anything.

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:56.170
I just... I don't know,
I thought I would...

01:17:56.272 --> 01:18:00.608
I thought I would feel something
more when I saw you tonight.

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:03.944
I know what you mean, I mean,
I... I expected to feel...

01:18:04.047 --> 01:18:05.813
Like a, like a... spark.

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:06.947
Yeah.

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:08.082
Exactly.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:11.085
I just, I don't think that
we should force this.

01:18:11.187 --> 01:18:12.253
Our letters.

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.888
We were so connected.

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.156
I know.

01:18:15.258 --> 01:18:16.368
The way you opened up about
how your brother's deafness

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:17.258
affected your family.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.926
Brother? What?

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:22.463
I don't, I don't...
I don't have a brother.

01:18:22.565 --> 01:18:23.464
What?

01:18:23.566 --> 01:18:24.432
Wait, are you Hutch?

01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:25.266
Hutch?

01:18:25.368 --> 01:18:26.167
No.

01:18:26.269 --> 01:18:29.136
No. You're not my pen pal!

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:29.837
I'm not?

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:30.939
No!

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:32.818
No, there must have been
some kind of a mix-up.

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:34.809
I stood up my pen pal!

01:18:34.911 --> 01:18:36.822
You need to get back in there,
it's Sarah!

01:18:36.846 --> 01:18:39.046
She's waiting for you,
and she's about to leave.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:39.680
Go!

01:18:39.782 --> 01:18:40.347
Sarah?

01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:41.782
Yes!

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:42.616
Look, are you sure?

01:18:42.719 --> 01:18:43.617
I can't just leave you.

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.418
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.687
Go, go, go.

01:18:48.257 --> 01:18:48.923
Wait, wait, wait!

01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:50.558
What about the book?

01:18:53.096 --> 01:18:54.096
Who?

01:19:51.521 --> 01:19:54.121
<i>To Hannah, I just left you
in your dorm,</i>

01:19:54.223 --> 01:19:56.335
<i>and your first day of college
is tomorrow.</i>

01:19:56.359 --> 01:19:58.492
<i>I'm so lucky to call you
my girlfriend,</i>

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:01.629
<i>and more importantly,
my best friend.</i>

01:20:01.731 --> 01:20:05.299
<i>I love you, and I'm so proud of
you for going after your dreams.</i>

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:08.536
<i>I know you're gonna
do amazing things.</i>

01:20:08.638 --> 01:20:11.172
<i>I believe in you, Sam.</i>

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:13.641
"Beleive".

01:20:13.743 --> 01:20:17.278
"I before e." It's Sam.

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.446
It's been Sam all along!

01:20:25.388 --> 01:20:26.754
Okay.

01:20:40.837 --> 01:20:41.869
Dad?

01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:43.003
It's so late!

01:20:43.105 --> 01:20:44.917
You're not gonna ground me,
are you?

01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:47.608
It's Susan, can you believe it?

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:50.477
She's so great, dad.
I've always thought so.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.890
It's funny how you can spend
years knowing someone

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:54.815
without really seeing them.

01:20:54.917 --> 01:20:56.917
I know what you mean.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:59.854
By the way, I told Susan
she'd be welcome here

01:20:59.956 --> 01:21:00.621
for Christmas dinner?

01:21:00.723 --> 01:21:01.755
Yeah, absolutely.

01:21:01.858 --> 01:21:02.423
Thank you.

01:21:02.525 --> 01:21:04.725
Tell me about your night.

01:21:04.827 --> 01:21:07.039
I saw you leaving with Daniel,
and the next thing I know,

01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:09.063
he's dancing
with Sarah Anderson.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:11.332
I am so confused.

01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:13.968
I think I finally know
what I want.

01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:15.436
Is that all I get?

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:16.670
Yes. For now.

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:17.638
More later.

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:19.017
But, I gotta go
before it's too late.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.908
I love you, dad.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:23.477
His cafe lights are on.

01:21:48.838 --> 01:21:51.538
<i>Dear Hutch, my name
is Hannah Morris.</i>

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:54.408
<i>Many years ago, I made
the worst mistake of my life,</i>

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:56.377
<i>when I decided to break
things off</i>

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:59.613
<i>with the most amazing person
I have ever known.</i>

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:02.917
<i>It has taken me a long time to
realize that the key to finding</i>

01:22:03.019 --> 01:22:07.321
<i>Christmas magic is spending it
with the person you love most.</i>

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:09.690
<i>Which has always been him.</i>

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:11.325
<i>Thanks for everything, Hutch.</i>

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.894
<i>But now, I must say goodbye,</i>

01:22:13.996 --> 01:22:15.807
<i>and do everything I can
to make things right</i>

01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:17.598
<i>with the man of my dreams.</i>

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.466
<i>Even if he does
occasionally forget</i>

01:22:19.568 --> 01:22:23.337
<i>that it's "i before e,
except after c.</i>

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:25.439
<i>Sincerely, Hannah.</i>

01:22:29.312 --> 01:22:31.145
Hi.

01:22:37.119 --> 01:22:38.797
Hannah, I'm so sorry
that I stood you up.

01:22:38.821 --> 01:22:41.922
I'm... sorry I lied
about signing up.

01:22:42.024 --> 01:22:43.502
When I realized it was you
I was writing to,

01:22:43.526 --> 01:22:44.603
it was almost Christmas Eve.

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:47.361
So you gave the book to Daniel?

01:22:47.463 --> 01:22:48.607
You said you didn't
want me around.

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:49.631
Sam.

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:51.176
You said you wanted
to focus on your future.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.833
You are my future.

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:59.506
I love you, Sam Watson.

01:23:08.684 --> 01:23:10.718
I love you too, Hannah Morris.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.353
I always have, I always will.

01:23:12.455 --> 01:23:14.199
Even when you don't know
what you want.

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:16.890
Even when you try
to push me away,

01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:21.095
I promise you I will never stop
loving you.

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:35.175
That's what I call a spark.

01:23:39.548 --> 01:23:41.682
Merry Christmas, Stardust.

01:23:41.784 --> 01:23:44.084
Merry Christmas, Hutch.
