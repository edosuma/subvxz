00:05.606 --> 00:07.608
[Emily] Previously on
Make It Or Break It:

00:07.641 --> 00:10.211
That I was presented
with clear evidence

00:10.244 --> 00:11.579
of inappropriate conduct.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.181
Here it is.

00:13.214 --> 00:14.548
Come on,
just take one bite.

00:14.582 --> 00:16.117
If I'm not hungry,
I'm not hungry.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.618
[groaning]

00:17.651 --> 00:19.387
That's what happens
when you starve yourself.

00:19.420 --> 00:22.356
My brother is having
seizure symptoms tonight.

00:22.390 --> 00:24.658
He needs his meds.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.695
- Oh, my God, are they
gonna arrest me?
- Yeah.

00:27.728 --> 00:31.165
As far as The Rock
is concerned,

00:31.199 --> 00:33.734
you're suspended
until further notice.

00:33.767 --> 00:35.603
I failed them as a coach.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.638
Maybe I'm not such
a good man after all.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.714
Now we have to practice
both day and night?

00:46.747 --> 00:48.249
This is so lame.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.617
I'm usually in bed by now.

00:49.650 --> 00:53.687
Do I have to remind you what's
coming up in a matter of weeks?

00:53.721 --> 00:54.655
Worlds.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.424
Worlds.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.192
I didn't hear
this much whining

00:58.226 --> 00:59.727
when we missed
school graduations

00:59.760 --> 01:02.430
and birthday parties
and spring break

01:02.463 --> 01:04.298
and everything else
that normal girls do.

01:04.332 --> 01:07.135
I don't want to hear anything
about missing some beauty sleep.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.203
At least the boys
have to be here too.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.776
Still with the boys?
Haven't you learned that...

01:37.798 --> 01:39.099
[all gasping]

01:39.133 --> 01:40.701
Follow me!

01:43.337 --> 01:44.338
[screaming]

01:44.372 --> 01:46.106
[Kaylie] Payson!

01:46.140 --> 01:47.541
[sucking]

01:47.575 --> 01:50.110
I'm right here
for you, Kaylie.

01:50.144 --> 01:52.580
I never meant
to hurt you.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.415
Don't believe him, Kaylie.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.484
It's another trap.
Run!

01:57.818 --> 01:59.753
[hissing]

02:06.260 --> 02:07.861
[footsteps approaching]

02:09.830 --> 02:11.865
Shh, shh, shh.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.302
It's OK, Kaylie.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.704
I'm safe.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.739
Let me show you.

02:21.409 --> 02:24.445
Kaylie.
You can trust him.

02:32.386 --> 02:35.389
Kaylie, get in! Get in!

02:40.728 --> 02:43.331
Sasha, I thought you left?

02:43.364 --> 02:45.633
No, Kaylie.
I'm here for you.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.734
I will always
be here for you.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.569
You're gonna get strong,
get healthy again.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.837
And I'll help you.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.807
[Sasha shouting]

02:54.375 --> 02:56.244
[sighs]

02:56.277 --> 02:57.611
What do you think it means?

02:59.280 --> 03:00.914
Other than I
shouldn't have watched

03:00.948 --> 03:03.417
that stupid vampire film
at movie night?

03:03.451 --> 03:04.518
I have no idea.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.555
Sometimes all of the people
in your dreams

03:07.588 --> 03:10.491
represent a part of you.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.426
For instance, Payson,
in your dream,

03:12.460 --> 03:14.795
was the leader that led
your team into a trap.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.299
Is there a part of you
that, as a leader,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.801
feels you might
have failed them?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.836
No.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.507
No, not exactly.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.842
[therapist] You mentioned
that each of your teammates

03:28.876 --> 03:31.178
was in a personal crisis

03:31.211 --> 03:33.247
leading up to the big show.

03:33.281 --> 03:36.250
Trials.
World Team Trials, OK?

03:36.284 --> 03:39.653
And no, I don't feel like
any of that was my fault.

03:41.722 --> 03:42.756
Anybody?

03:44.658 --> 03:47.761
What about the part

03:47.795 --> 03:49.463
where your coach
says he's there for you,

03:49.497 --> 03:51.665
then you bite him?

03:51.699 --> 03:53.601
What do you think
that means?

03:53.634 --> 03:56.304
I have no idea, really.

03:56.337 --> 03:59.640
I guess I'm just
not that deep.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.376
Tell me the first word
that comes into your mind

04:02.410 --> 04:04.978
when you think of your gym,
The Rock.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.782
Home.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.320
What do you think
is happening at home right now?

04:14.722 --> 04:17.825
I think it's probably
falling apart.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.895
* Show me the sun

04:56.364 --> 04:57.465
* In the dark...

04:57.498 --> 04:58.966
[Chloe] So, are you
gonna start

04:58.999 --> 05:00.701
working on your new vault
for Worlds?

05:00.734 --> 05:03.871
I have no idea if I'm still
on the team going to Worlds.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.507
Honey, you did have something
to do with all of this.

05:06.540 --> 05:10.411
You did steal and you did fail
to appear at your hearing.

05:10.444 --> 05:14.448
I stole the meds to help Brian
because you were AWOL.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.485
And I went to World Trials
instead of my court date

05:17.518 --> 05:19.052
because I thought it was
taken care of.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.454
But thank you so much
for the support, Mom.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.357
I love feeling like I'm
all alone in the world.

05:23.391 --> 05:25.926
* Are you ready to leave?

05:25.959 --> 05:27.761
[sighs]

05:28.829 --> 05:31.599
* Goodbye

05:31.632 --> 05:36.737
* Are you ready to go
' Cause it's not guaranteed *

05:36.770 --> 05:40.307
* When you're ready
to say goodbye **

05:40.340 --> 05:42.510
What? I don't want
to go to practice

05:42.543 --> 05:45.879
and I don't want to go to
some stupid exhibition
in Denver this weekend.

05:45.913 --> 05:49.383
Payson, you need to move on.

05:49.417 --> 05:51.652
With your training
and with your life.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.886
Sasha wouldn't want...

05:52.920 --> 05:54.988
How do we know what he'd
want or wouldn't want?

05:55.022 --> 05:58.058
We don't,
'cause he's gone.

05:58.091 --> 06:04.031
* Only time will tell
But I just can't help myself *

06:04.064 --> 06:06.834
Lauren, you really have to
move back in with your father.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.502
No, I don't.

06:08.536 --> 06:09.670
If you don't want me anymore,

06:09.703 --> 06:11.371
I can find somewhere else
to stay.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.107
Your father loves you.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.710
If he did, he wouldn't have
kept my mother from me.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.112
Now she's dead
and it's too late.

06:19.146 --> 06:22.650
Lauren, honey, forgiveness
is the only thing that heals.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.955
* Are you ready to go?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.924
* 'Cause it's not guaranteed *

06:31.825 --> 06:33.494
Not always.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.796
Sometimes people do things
that are so bad,

06:35.829 --> 06:37.931
no one will ever
forgive them.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.537
[Emily] Is Sasha for sure
not coming back?

06:43.571 --> 06:45.372
To tell you the truth,
I have no idea.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.740
I haven't spoken
to my dad.

06:46.774 --> 06:50.377
But I'm sure Sasha
didn't want to stick around
to coach jailbirds.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.679
OK, enough.
We all know

06:51.712 --> 06:53.747
that the picture of my
stupid attempt to kiss Sasha

06:53.781 --> 06:55.449
is responsible
for this mess.

06:55.483 --> 06:57.618
Does anyone know how
Ellen Beals got a hold of it?

06:57.651 --> 06:59.753
No clue. But Sasha won't
be totally off the hook

06:59.787 --> 07:02.623
until they find
the whole video that shows
what really happened.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.496
How's Lauren?

07:08.529 --> 07:10.564
She's OK.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.666
We'll get her to
move back home, Steve.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.101
I'm not so sure.

07:14.134 --> 07:19.006
I think she's capable
of holding a grudge
for a lifetime.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.744
So, how's the coach search
coming?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.813
Not so great.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.581
How can that be?

07:27.615 --> 07:29.583
[scoffs] This is The Rock.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.085
Well, all the best coaches
are under contract,

07:32.119 --> 07:36.056
plus this gym has
at the moment.nk on it

07:36.089 --> 07:39.159
Well, did you ever...
get a hold of Sasha?

07:39.192 --> 07:40.728
No.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.497
I left messages for him
everywhere I could think of.

07:43.531 --> 07:46.233
Unless you know
where he is?

07:47.768 --> 07:49.903
I do have to ask you
one thing, Steve.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.940
And you have to tell me
the honest truth...

07:52.973 --> 07:55.576
OK, look, Steve.

07:55.609 --> 07:58.512
If we're gonna work together,
I have to know one thing.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.747
Did you leak that picture

07:59.780 --> 08:02.015
of Payson kissing Sasha
to Ellen Beals?

08:02.049 --> 08:03.617
What?

08:07.521 --> 08:10.624
I can sincerely say,
absolutely not.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.092
Look, I was hard
on the guy,

08:12.125 --> 08:13.927
but I would never do
such a thing.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.496
And if I ever
find out who did?

08:16.530 --> 08:18.632
They'll be out of this gym.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.736
[woman] I read your case file.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.772
You've been leading
a pretty extreme lifestyle.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.074
What with the
restricted diet,

08:27.107 --> 08:29.810
the intense training,
the scale at the gym...

08:29.843 --> 08:31.779
Because I'm a
professional athlete.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.247
Peyton Manning
and Kobe Bryant

08:34.281 --> 08:35.649
are on restricted diets

08:35.683 --> 08:38.251
with training schedules
and weigh-ins too.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.087
I don't see them here.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.656
[woman] It's not
the same, Kaylie.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.858
You're in your eating disorder.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.998
I used to live on Tic Tacs
and self-loathing,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.501
but I have made
so much progress
since I've come here.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.904
It didn't happen overnight,
but for real,

08:56.937 --> 08:58.572
the best thing
I ever did

08:58.606 --> 09:03.644
was fully surrender and
admit that I belong here.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.147
Kaylie, do you think
you belong here?

09:11.685 --> 09:12.552
Sure.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.588
I guess.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.827
OK, you've got to
get more height.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.229
Right... now.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.330
[grunting]

09:26.266 --> 09:27.334
Hey, Austin?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.309
Would you help Emily over
after the handspring?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.682
[Payson] OK, again.

09:42.683 --> 09:43.350
Go!

09:44.618 --> 09:46.086
Right... now!

09:51.324 --> 09:54.762
Great. So if Austin
does the routine with me,

09:54.795 --> 09:57.064
- then I'm in business.
- Only if we have matching leos.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.566
Well, at least now
to feel like to nail it.sed

09:59.599 --> 10:00.934
It's a start.

10:03.671 --> 10:06.339
So, have you talked to Kaylie?

10:06.373 --> 10:08.676
They haven't even
let her call.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.711
But we get to
see her tomorrow

10:10.744 --> 10:12.780
when we go to Denver
for the exhibition.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.848
So, they're letting you go.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.585
That is up to her.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.619
[Austin] Who's that?

10:19.653 --> 10:22.756
That is my
probation officer.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.959
As part of
the probation process,

10:25.993 --> 10:27.360
it's my job to interface

10:27.394 --> 10:29.897
with the various authority
figures in Emily's life,

10:29.930 --> 10:32.365
and assess how
she's coming along.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.367
[sighs] You'll have to
excuse me,

10:34.401 --> 10:38.205
but in all my time with the
National Gymnastics Organization

10:38.238 --> 10:39.773
I've never had to meet

10:39.807 --> 10:43.610
with an athlete's
probation officer before.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.678
Gymnasts are usually

10:44.712 --> 10:47.647
the most dedicated and
hard-working of young people.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.282
I am dedicated
and hardworking.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.617
And defensive.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.319
Frankly, Emily,

10:52.352 --> 10:55.255
I'd think you'd be offering
nothing but contrition.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.957
OK, excuse me,
we were wondering

10:56.990 --> 11:00.360
what the status of Emily's
World Team membership is.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.329
Well, like Emily's
probation officer,

11:02.362 --> 11:05.398
we at the NGO
need to do some investigating

11:05.432 --> 11:07.400
and come to our own conclusions
on that matter.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.903
How long does her
probation last?

11:09.937 --> 11:12.372
This seems kind of extreme
for the offense.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.175
We understand
the circumstances
of her arrest,

11:15.208 --> 11:17.344
but unfortunately,
she stole drugs.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.313
That falls under a new,
strict zero-tolerance law.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.681
And on top of that?

11:21.715 --> 11:23.283
She willfully failed
to show up for a hearing.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.018
It wasn't willful!

11:25.052 --> 11:28.221
Excuse me, but is Emily
allowed to go to Denver
this weekend?

11:28.255 --> 11:29.689
There's a big exhibition.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.192
Denver is making a bid
to host the 2018 Olympics,

11:32.225 --> 11:34.928
and all the future Olympians
from the area will be there.

11:34.962 --> 11:36.997
It's important to us
that she be there too.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.866
We're supporting
Denver's bid

11:38.899 --> 11:40.100
to get the Olympics
back to the U.S.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.668
I'll be with her,

11:41.701 --> 11:43.403
I'll watch her
every step of the way.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.105
Saturday, at least,

11:45.138 --> 11:46.740
I have to work on Friday.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.208
I'll be chaperoning.

11:48.241 --> 11:52.179
I'll take full responsibility
for her.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.414
Well, I did ask the court
about Denver,

11:54.447 --> 11:57.317
but since Emily is currently
restricted to home and gym only,

11:57.350 --> 12:01.021
if she wants to go
to the exhibition...

12:01.054 --> 12:04.257
She'll have to wear this
ankle monitoring device.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.727
I cannot do gymnastics
wearing that thing!

12:07.761 --> 12:10.063
I don't see how floor
and vault will be affected.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.932
People will see it!

12:11.965 --> 12:14.234
[sighs] Perhaps you could
wear pants?

12:18.872 --> 12:22.175
Lauren.
Honey, can we talk?

12:25.879 --> 12:27.714
Oh, my gosh.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.717
[indistinct chattering]

12:30.750 --> 12:33.854
[Steve] OK, nothing
to see here.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.956
Everyone back to practice.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.357
Sweetie, it's gonna be OK.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.893
Mom, please.
It's only making it worse.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.400
I'm doing the best
I can, OK?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.956
I think I know who you are.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.091
You are our featured
gymnastics team.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.060
Yeah, we're from the Rocky
Mountain Training Center?

13:13.093 --> 13:14.862
We've got a great weekend
for you girls.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.864
There's gonna be
a fantastic private party,

13:16.897 --> 13:19.199
and I've got your passes
for the Governor's VIP area.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.268
Whoopsie.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.904
That's all for the, uh,
Denver Elite Team.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.538
Denver?

13:25.572 --> 13:28.175
They don't even have any girls
on the World's Team.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.510
Yeah, well, that's about
to change, isn't it?

13:30.543 --> 13:33.947
With Kaylie wasting away
and Emily in juvie,

13:33.981 --> 13:35.782
I think at least two spots
will be opening up.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.319
And the ankle injury
that kept me out of the
World Trials is better.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.055
I have every intention of
going to Rio and winning.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.356
We're the Denver Elite.

13:43.390 --> 13:47.194
Great. Here's your
press schedule and VIP passes.

13:47.227 --> 13:51.098
I'm sorry, but this is
the team I've been
told to showcase.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.034
If you just hang on,
my boss wants to meet you.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.869
Excuse me.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.972
Why on earth would they
showcase you over us?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.041
Uh, let me guess.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.976
Maybe because
this is an event

14:03.010 --> 14:05.545
to show the best face
of Colorado
to the whole world

14:05.578 --> 14:08.448
and your gym is a cesspool
of controversy.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.217
I wonder which one
of your spots

14:10.250 --> 14:12.052
on the Worlds Team
I'm gonna take?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.553
But I guess I'll let
the National Committee
figure that out

14:13.586 --> 14:16.189
after we rock
the exhibition.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.091
How do I hate
thee's guts?

14:18.125 --> 14:19.826
Let me count the ways.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.061
OK, we cannot let Denver
outshine us.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.129
We have to up our game.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.463
Do you guys
seriously expect me

14:23.496 --> 14:25.966
to be able to do gymnastics
with this thing on?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.235
We don't have a choice.
You can wear long sweats.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.937
Great.
So I'll be the freak.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.271
The National Committee's
gonna be here tomorrow,

14:31.304 --> 14:33.907
so we all have to be flawless.
Especially you, Emily.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.112
Speaking of flawless.

14:39.146 --> 14:41.982
Mmm. Hunky.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.384
- It's what's for dinner.
- Hey, you guys.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.087
This is my old pal, Max.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.221
This is Emily,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.090
Lauren,

14:50.123 --> 14:51.458
and Payson.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.393
Hi, Max.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.930
What? Do I have something
on my face?

14:56.964 --> 15:01.868
No, no.
Your face is... fantastic.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.136
For what?

15:03.170 --> 15:04.938
For catching the light.

15:04.972 --> 15:06.606
Max is into photography.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.075
I love photography!

15:08.108 --> 15:10.277
Where does Max come from?

15:10.310 --> 15:12.879
Texas, but he's thinking
of moving to Colorado.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.315
He's trying to decide
between Denver and Boulder.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.284
[scoffs] Well, Boulder,
of course, silly.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.919
And why Boulder exactly?

15:19.953 --> 15:21.254
See you guys later.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.090
Payson.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.525
Emily.

15:25.558 --> 15:26.926
[Payson chuckling]

15:26.960 --> 15:28.428
He was totally into you.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.063
- OK, right.
- He was!

15:30.097 --> 15:32.032
Believe me, the type of guy
that's into Lauren

15:32.065 --> 15:33.500
is definitely not into me.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.436
So, you guys
seeing Kaylie today?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.005
Yeah, do you
want to come?

15:38.038 --> 15:39.639
I don't think
it's a good idea.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.242
For her or for you?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.315
[Payson] This place is weird.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.083
[Emily] This whole thing
is weird.

15:50.117 --> 15:53.253
[Lauren] Says the girl wearing
an electronic monitoring device.

15:55.022 --> 15:58.125
Why didn't we see
Kaylie was in trouble?

15:58.158 --> 16:02.295
I did. But then again,
I know her better than
anyone else here.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.064
I mean, we are
best friends.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.565
Were best friends.

16:05.598 --> 16:10.003
Kaylie was feeling really
trapped by Sasha before he left.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.671
He was onto her anorexia,

16:11.704 --> 16:14.207
and she was starting
to freak out.

16:14.241 --> 16:17.077
Maybe she took matters
into her own hands.

16:18.145 --> 16:22.982
She and Austin were working
a lot on that video cam.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.518
Are you saying that
Kaylie sent that picture
to Ellen Beals?

16:26.586 --> 16:29.122
- Hey.
- Kaylie!

16:35.495 --> 16:38.031
[Emily] So, what's it like
in here?

16:38.065 --> 16:39.999
They let you eat
whatever you want?

16:40.033 --> 16:43.136
What I would give for a
guilt-free red velvet cupcake.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.738
Not exactly, Lauren.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.208
Recovery is all about
being healthy.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.277
So, how are you doing?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.978
Really.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.180
I'm just trying to
get out of here

16:53.213 --> 16:54.381
so I can get back
to my gymnastics,

16:54.414 --> 16:56.583
and start working again, ASAP.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.118
I feel so out of it.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.753
Like I'm on the outside
looking in, you know?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.122
I know the feeling.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.625
Oh, my God!
Emily, I didn't know.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.027
I mean, I knew about Sasha,
but not this.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.263
Payson would rather we didn't
talk about her boyfriend.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.299
- Shut up.
- Oh, is Austin here?

17:12.332 --> 17:14.601
You know, doing
the exhibition too?

17:14.634 --> 17:16.103
Yeah.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.770
He's actually practicing.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.406
Right.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.674
Oh, but he has a seriously
hottie friend named Max

17:21.708 --> 17:23.076
who might be
moving to Boulder.

17:23.110 --> 17:24.777
Honestly, haven't boys
been enough problems?

17:24.811 --> 17:28.014
Sorry, not all of us
crush on guys who get
senior citizen discounts.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.250
At least I'm not obsessed with
some stupid high school boy

17:30.283 --> 17:31.584
with over-gelled hair.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.053
A-ha! So you did
sneak a peek.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.457
Kaylie... it seems like
you're really good.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.791
We have to get back
to practice, and I'm sure

17:38.825 --> 17:42.362
you have to get back
to doing... whatever.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.464
Thanks for coming.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.634
I miss you guys, but
I'll be back soon.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.102
You better be.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.770
We have a Chinese team
to destroy at Worlds.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.772
- [Kaylie scoffs]
- [Payson chuckles]

17:56.809 --> 17:58.811
[crowd chattering]

18:02.815 --> 18:04.151
If you're looking
for the press,

18:04.184 --> 18:05.785
there's like a ton of them
right over there.

18:05.818 --> 18:07.554
Waiting for Kelly Parker,
I'm sure.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.156
Some things just
never change.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.690
Actually, I can care less
about the press.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.091
Do you guys think
Max is here?

18:12.125 --> 18:14.594
I really want him to see me
in my new dress.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.264
- [reporters] Kelly Parker!
- Kelly, over here!

18:21.301 --> 18:24.704
Look at her just eating up
all the spotlight.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.806
[Emily] I cannot believe
the Denver Elite

18:26.839 --> 18:28.175
are back to being
the girls of the hour.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.676
After we kicked
their asses.

18:29.709 --> 18:31.110
[man] Rock Rebels!
Over here.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.379
Show us those
rebel smiles.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.118
Max!

18:40.687 --> 18:43.156
Thanks for throwing
some love our way.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.357
We're like press lepers.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.692
It wasn't charity.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.126
You girls are gorgeous.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.628
Oh, you poor little things.

18:48.661 --> 18:51.130
Are you sure you don't want
to take our picture?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.399
You're the Denver Elite.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.700
That's the gym
you don't want to go to.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.134
- What gym?
- Gym?

18:55.168 --> 18:57.304
[Austin] I didn't tell you?
Max is a gymnast.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.306
He's trying to decide
which club to join.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.108
Rocky Mountain
or Denver Elite.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.476
Well, of course you
have to come to Denver.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.713
At least there I'm not fighting
Austin for all the attention.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.416
Please.
Denver is so lame.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.385
And with Nicky Russo gone,
your men's team sucks.

19:12.419 --> 19:13.886
Yeah, not anymore.

19:13.920 --> 19:16.623
We have a fantastic,
new rings specialist.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.826
In fact, we've become
quite the close friends.

19:19.859 --> 19:20.893
Car-Car!

19:24.197 --> 19:24.864
Carter?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.199
Oh, my God!

19:26.233 --> 19:27.300
Carter, what are you doing?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.602
Ask Lauren.
She knows why I left.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.903
But I guess
she did me a favor.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.572
The Rock's going down.

19:32.605 --> 19:35.608
Everyone knows Denver
is the place to be.

19:43.650 --> 19:44.817
[dance music playing]

19:52.959 --> 19:55.695
You've got some
serious moves, Lauren.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.264
On the mats and off.

19:58.831 --> 20:01.368
So, where's
your friend, Payson?

20:01.401 --> 20:03.936
Um, probably napping.
She likes to rest,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.539
and knit and bake cakes.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.642
I, however,
like to have fun.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.578
[rock music starts]

20:15.282 --> 20:16.249
Ooh.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.917
Oh, it's on.

20:17.950 --> 20:18.918
What?

20:18.951 --> 20:20.320
I said hold me closer.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.491
I say, Max, is it?

20:24.524 --> 20:28.395
As someone who's been at
both The Rock and Denver,

20:28.428 --> 20:30.730
I have to tell you...

20:30.763 --> 20:33.433
Girls at The Rock: Great.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.636
But the women...
in Denver.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.475
Oh, I don't know,
I mean, the girls
at The Rock

20:42.509 --> 20:45.912
are looking
pretty impressive
right now.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.725
You want to dance?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.361
Thanks.
Um, but my dance partner

21:01.394 --> 21:04.230
is recording an album
in Los Angeles, so...

21:04.263 --> 21:06.466
I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.301
Yeah, I know what you mean.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.336
Kaylie?

21:10.903 --> 21:13.272
I've got a shoulder
for you to lean on.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.408
Two if it's real messed up.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.814
I'm just so scared,

21:21.848 --> 21:25.552
that everything I've worked
my entire life for is...

21:25.585 --> 21:27.954
just gonna be taken away,
at any minute.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.690
Hey, hey. You don't know
what's gonna happen.

21:30.723 --> 21:32.992
And you can't control it.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.026
So don't worry
about it, right?

21:34.060 --> 21:36.028
If I don't worry,

21:36.062 --> 21:38.498
then the bills
don't get paid.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.033
And then the car
gets taken away,

21:41.067 --> 21:44.837
and my brother's medicine
doesn't get paid for.

21:44.871 --> 21:47.940
My one shot at living
a worry-free life

21:47.974 --> 21:49.809
was winning gold
at the Olympics.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.945
So that my family
didn't have to struggle.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.449
And now...
that one shot

21:56.483 --> 21:59.819
might be ruined because of
one stupid mistake.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.690
And I just can't help
but be so angry at myself

22:03.723 --> 22:04.957
and at my...

22:07.994 --> 22:09.362
Who else are you angry with?

22:09.396 --> 22:10.697
[sighs]

22:10.730 --> 22:13.332
At my mother.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.836
I just...
I can't help but think

22:16.869 --> 22:20.106
that if she was just
better at everything,

22:21.608 --> 22:24.310
then maybe we wouldn't be
living hand to mouth.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.013
So it's all your mom's fault.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.881
She's the reason
you stole the meds?

22:31.418 --> 22:32.752
I know that you think that

22:32.785 --> 22:36.823
being on a Wheaties box
makes you all high and mighty.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.024
But you weren't there.

22:38.057 --> 22:38.991
Yeah, you're right,
I wasn't there.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.760
But you had a choice.

22:40.793 --> 22:43.062
And you let your teammates down
when you stole that medicine.

22:43.095 --> 22:46.098
- Regardless of the reason.
- OK, but my mother...

22:46.132 --> 22:48.801
OK, you need to stop blaming
your mother someday, Emily.

22:48.835 --> 22:49.936
My brother was sick.

22:49.969 --> 22:53.072
Then why didn't you just
call an ambulance?

22:55.141 --> 22:56.776
Thanks for the shoulder.

23:03.115 --> 23:05.051
[knock on door]

23:16.796 --> 23:17.830
Mr. McGowen.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.799
- May I come in?
- Of course.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.969
Sorry to come by unannounced.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.037
We thought it was best
to get a real

23:25.071 --> 23:28.841
and unbiased view
of what life is like for Emily.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.844
Yes, well, I was just
about to leave for work.

23:31.878 --> 23:33.412
At 9PM?

23:33.446 --> 23:34.681
What is it that you do?

23:34.714 --> 23:37.684
I work in an emergency
response center.

23:37.717 --> 23:41.420
- At the phone bank.
- I see.

23:41.454 --> 23:46.058
According to our reports,
Emily also has a job.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.960
You realize
that's unsustainable

23:47.994 --> 23:49.462
for an elite caliber
gymnast, don't you?

23:49.496 --> 23:51.430
Well, she did
medal against China,

23:51.464 --> 23:54.667
and made the Worlds Team
over other girls

23:54.701 --> 23:57.504
who didn't have jobs.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.140
Is this where Emily sleeps?

24:02.041 --> 24:04.143
She doesn't have
her own room?

24:05.778 --> 24:09.716
I know it seems a bit odd,
but Emily insisted.

24:09.749 --> 24:13.553
What else do you let
your daughter insist upon,
Mrs. Kmetko?

24:13.586 --> 24:17.590
Look, Mr. McGowen,
I will do everything I can

24:17.624 --> 24:19.158
to cooperate with your
little inquisition

24:19.191 --> 24:22.061
because I love my daughter
more than life itself.

24:22.094 --> 24:24.631
I don't think
you understand

24:24.664 --> 24:27.099
how much specialized
commitment it takes

24:27.133 --> 24:29.902
to compete in this sport
at Emily's level.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.704
These girls
are thoroughbreds,

24:31.738 --> 24:33.105
and they need to be
treated that way.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.207
And I don't think
that you people

24:35.241 --> 24:37.877
understand that your sport

24:37.910 --> 24:41.080
can eat a family up
and everyone in it.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.916
I have one
special needs child

24:43.950 --> 24:46.819
and another child
that is in the top tier

24:46.853 --> 24:49.121
of an incredibly demanding
and expensive sport.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.723
I may not understand
a lot of things,

24:50.757 --> 24:52.525
but I do
understand commitment.

24:52.559 --> 24:55.828
So, please, excuse me.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.697
Because I need
to go to work.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.604
Hey.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.539
I'm not here
to judge you, Chloe.

25:06.573 --> 25:09.108
I'm here to try to save
your daughter's dream.

25:09.141 --> 25:11.210
I know how hard this sport
can be on a family,

25:11.243 --> 25:14.113
but we both want
the same thing for Emily.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.281
Don't we?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.534
[dance music playing]

25:45.912 --> 25:47.714
Poor Payson Keeler.

25:47.747 --> 25:49.982
First, a broken back
and now a broken heart.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.619
You must have been devastated
when Sasha left.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.053
There will be other coaches.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.121
Yeah, but you only have
one first love.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.023
You don't know what
you're talking about.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.127
You know, it's ironic.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.129
Everyone was gunning
for Sasha,

26:03.162 --> 26:06.132
but he was like rubber, it all
just bounced right off him.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.134
But all it took was
one little kiss from you

26:08.167 --> 26:09.802
to bring Sasha the Great
to his knees.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.671
OK, I don't know
what rumors you've heard...

26:11.704 --> 26:13.105
Oh, I've heard
delicious rumors.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.774
All about how you and Sasha

26:14.807 --> 26:17.043
have been carrying on
for awhile.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.210
I always had my doubts
about him as a coach,

26:18.244 --> 26:20.546
but I never knew to
peg him for a creep.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.049
Sasha did nothing wrong.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.685
If he did nothing wrong, why did
he run away from The Rock?

26:25.718 --> 26:28.020
Why is he hiding out in Denver?

26:28.054 --> 26:31.157
Sasha's not in Denver.

26:31.190 --> 26:34.560
According to Marty, he is.
So tell me...

26:34.593 --> 26:38.030
...is he as strict a coach
in the bedroom
as he is on the floor?

26:39.098 --> 26:40.933
Oh...

26:42.201 --> 26:45.271
[Kim] Payson, stop.
What happened?

26:45.304 --> 26:47.106
- Let's go.
- What?

26:47.139 --> 26:49.208
We need to leave this party
right now and go find Sasha.

26:49.241 --> 26:50.977
He's in Denver.

26:51.010 --> 26:52.144
You're not making any sense.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.780
What makes you think
Sasha's in Denver?

26:53.813 --> 26:54.947
Kelly Parker said so.

26:54.981 --> 26:56.716
Oh, Kelly Parker.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.050
She'd say anything
to mess with your head.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.152
Mom! This is different.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.354
Marty told her
that Sasha is in Denver.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.090
Maybe this means
he's coming back.

27:04.123 --> 27:06.158
I highly doubt that, sweetie.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.227
Then why would he
hang around?

27:08.260 --> 27:10.329
Maybe he's just waiting
for us to find him.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.365
Does that sound like
Sasha to you?

27:15.768 --> 27:17.904
Maybe. I don't know.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.940
But we have to find out.
Please, Mom. Let's go.

27:20.973 --> 27:24.043
We have to try, even if there's
just the tiniest chance.

27:24.076 --> 27:28.014
Payson, Sasha
has made his decision.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.982
And you have to
respect that.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.018
Let him go.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.822
In time, you'll see that moving
on is the best thing you can do.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.056
Other coaches do exist,

27:37.089 --> 27:38.758
and so do other boys
your own age.

27:38.791 --> 27:41.260
I don't want some stupid boy
my own age.

27:41.293 --> 27:45.097
I want my coach back.
You were friends with him too.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.900
You've really accepted
that he's just gone?

27:47.934 --> 27:49.101
Yes.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.770
I have.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.805
Fine.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.174
Fine, I'll let him go.

27:55.207 --> 27:58.110
I'll let my dream go.

27:58.144 --> 27:59.245
I'll let the whole
damn thing go.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.031
Don't move.

28:19.065 --> 28:22.168
Is this some sort
of a stick-up?

28:22.201 --> 28:24.771
No, it's the light.

You do know you're
missing the party?

28:35.214 --> 28:38.150
Yeah, but I seriously doubt
that the party's missing me.

28:38.184 --> 28:39.752
I thought you were off
with Lauren?

28:39.786 --> 28:41.888
Yeah, Lauren.

Cool girl, but...

28:44.123 --> 28:47.059
No. I'm not with her.

shots of Bode Miller.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.696

- Yeah, sure.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.898
OK, check these out.

28:59.371 --> 29:01.040
Is it just me or is this
a little awkward?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.108
Just a little.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.076
OK, confession.

29:04.110 --> 29:07.379
I've... been a fan of yours
since I saw your video on-line.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.015
On-line? What are you
talking about?

- Really, you haven't seen it?
- No.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.465

must have posted it.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.400
But why?

29:28.434 --> 29:32.004
Probably so the world can see
how beautiful you are.

As a gymnast.
In the video, I...

And just in general.

You must know that.

I didn't.

Not for a long time,
but then a very...

29:49.155 --> 29:52.424

34:59.365 --> 35:01.600
* Feel the motion
as the mood changes *

35:01.633 --> 35:03.602
* Round and round
Just like the move spaces *

35:03.635 --> 35:05.537
* This is the part that keeps
the place blazin' *

35:05.571 --> 35:07.639
[gasps]

35:35.667 --> 35:38.136
[rock music plays]

35:42.208 --> 35:44.176
[crowd cheering]

36:19.278 --> 36:20.879
[Austin] Glad to have you.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.481
[man on P.A.]
OK, let's hear it

36:22.514 --> 36:24.383
for all the gymnasts that
performed today, and don't...

36:24.416 --> 36:25.384
Wait!

36:25.417 --> 36:30.756
Um... as everybody can see,

36:30.789 --> 36:35.160
I'm wearing an
ankle monitoring device.

36:35.193 --> 36:39.231
I was arrested
a month ago.
For stealing.

36:39.265 --> 36:43.235
I'd like to publicly
acknowledge that

36:43.269 --> 36:45.537
I made a terrible mistake.

36:45.571 --> 36:46.905
I wasn't thinking,

36:46.938 --> 36:49.275
and in one moment,

36:49.308 --> 36:51.943
I did something that hurt me,

36:51.977 --> 36:54.246
and it hurt my club,

36:54.280 --> 36:57.215
and it hurt my team,

36:57.249 --> 36:58.950
and it hurt my sport.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.654
I need to apologize
because it's really important

37:02.688 --> 37:06.224
that everybody know that
The Rock is a fantastic club,

37:06.258 --> 37:08.360
and I disgraced it.

37:08.394 --> 37:12.431
And Sasha Belov is
a fantastic coach,

37:12.464 --> 37:16.635
and I disgraced him.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.938
And my mother...

37:19.971 --> 37:23.008
She does her best.
And, um...

37:24.276 --> 37:25.977
...and I disgraced her.

37:26.011 --> 37:31.717
And I am so, so sorry.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.353
That's all.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.487
[crowd applauding]

37:44.763 --> 37:48.634
You raised
a great daughter.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.940
I'm proud of you.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.342
Thanks.

37:56.375 --> 37:58.243
So that's it?
You just say you're sorry

37:58.276 --> 37:59.978
and it makes it all OK?

38:00.011 --> 38:03.014
It's a start.

38:03.048 --> 38:05.917
Maybe it will get everyone
off my back for awhile.

38:05.951 --> 38:10.288
And you like,
forgive your mom?

38:10.322 --> 38:11.590
For everything?

38:11.623 --> 38:15.394
Honestly? No.

38:15.427 --> 38:19.698
But you and I,
we only have one parent.

38:19.731 --> 38:23.301
And if we push them away,
then what do we have left?

38:42.788 --> 38:44.723
You came.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.425
I've been worried
about you.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.026
Well, you don't
have to be.

38:48.059 --> 38:50.762
I'm doing great, you know,
working the program and all.

38:50.796 --> 38:53.064
That's good.
That's really good.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.369
I just wanted to see you.
That's all.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.837
So I better...

38:58.870 --> 39:01.607
Actually...
Can I ask you something?

39:03.074 --> 39:05.911
[stammering] I need to know.

39:05.944 --> 39:09.047
When you said you were
falling for me,

39:09.080 --> 39:11.683
was that serious?

39:11.717 --> 39:13.885
Or was it just your ploy

39:13.919 --> 39:16.622
to get me to admit
I had a problem?

39:16.655 --> 39:18.724
No, I was serious.

39:20.959 --> 39:25.030
What if I said I was
falling for you, too?

39:29.935 --> 39:32.103
I would tell you to put it
out of your mind for a while.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.639
What?

39:33.672 --> 39:34.906
If you've been
paying attention around here,

39:34.940 --> 39:37.042
then you know you can't date
anyone for a long while

39:37.075 --> 39:39.010
- when you're in recovery.
- But I'm doing better.

39:39.044 --> 39:42.981
Then you should know that we
can't have anything together.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.751
Not now.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.820
Oh.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.457
I get it.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.958
You are that guy.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.093
What guy?

39:55.126 --> 39:57.362
The kind of guy that likes
the chase. You're a player.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.997
Once you've got
a girl on the hook,
you throw her back, right?

39:59.030 --> 40:02.133
Maybe that was once true,
but it's not anymore.

40:02.167 --> 40:06.104
Well, it's OK, because
I am not falling for you.

40:06.137 --> 40:07.673
So you can just
run along now

40:07.706 --> 40:09.407
because I have everything
under control here.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.112
I don't think so, Kaylie.

40:14.145 --> 40:17.816
But thankfully, they're not
gonna let you out of here
until you do.

40:20.519 --> 40:25.123
* Fall face first
Hit rock bottom *

40:25.857 --> 40:27.726
[sighs]

40:28.794 --> 40:32.864
* Tender moment at cathedral

40:32.898 --> 40:36.101
* Children praying
Embracing with angels *

40:36.134 --> 40:40.171
* Once more that they know
When no sorrow's mine *

40:40.205 --> 40:41.940
Did you switch our rooms?

40:41.973 --> 40:44.042
Yep, I'm sleeping
out here now.

40:45.711 --> 40:47.946
You deserve it, honey.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.484
* To learn in life
You have to *

40:52.518 --> 40:56.722
* Fall face first
Hit rock bottom *

40:58.524 --> 41:03.795
* Fall face first
Hit rock bottom *

41:03.829 --> 41:06.532
* To learn in life
You have to *

41:06.565 --> 41:11.803
* Fall face first
Hit rock bottom *

41:11.837 --> 41:14.205
* To learn in life
You have to *

41:14.239 --> 41:19.611
* Fall face first
Hit rock bottom **

41:23.682 --> 41:28.153
It's almost time
for lights out.

41:28.186 --> 41:29.721
I'm on it.

41:31.557 --> 41:34.693
So. Who was that cute guy
who was visiting you today?

41:34.726 --> 41:36.628
I don't want
to talk about it.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.096
But maybe if you talk...

41:38.129 --> 41:40.532
In fact, I've had about
enough talking and sharing

41:40.566 --> 41:41.833
and group therapy
in this place

41:41.867 --> 41:43.468
to last me
a flipping lifetime.

41:43.501 --> 41:45.604
I just want to stop
with the blah-blah-blah,

41:45.637 --> 41:48.039
get my ass out of here
and start training for Worlds,

41:48.073 --> 41:51.009
which, by the way, has been my
goal since I was five years old.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.551
I'm sorry, Maeve.

41:59.585 --> 42:03.254
I know you're the
"super rehab camper" here,

42:03.288 --> 42:08.059
but my situation is
a little different
than everybody else.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.562
I'm not some
screwed up teenager.

42:10.596 --> 42:13.699
Being small is just
part of my sport.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.837
I get it.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.172
It's part of my sport too.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.274
What are you talking about?

42:23.308 --> 42:26.678
If you've ever done runway
in six-inch Louboutins,

42:26.712 --> 42:29.615
you'd know it's a sport.

42:29.648 --> 42:30.982
I'm a model, dummy!

42:31.016 --> 42:33.018
Professionally?

42:33.051 --> 42:35.654
If you call an editorial shoot
for German Allure

42:35.687 --> 42:36.722
in three weeks
professional.

42:36.755 --> 42:37.989
Wait, wait.
So all that

42:38.023 --> 42:40.992
"I'm more than
just a number" stuff...

42:41.026 --> 42:42.160
It's called acting.

42:42.193 --> 42:45.597
I don't belong here either,
neither of us do.

42:45.631 --> 42:47.766
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything earlier,

42:47.799 --> 42:49.100
I had to be sure
we were safe.

42:49.134 --> 42:52.137
Thank God I'm not alone.
I thought I was going crazy.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.805
You're not crazy.

42:53.839 --> 42:55.841
We both have to be thin
as part of our jobs.

42:55.874 --> 42:59.778
- Thank you.
- This is my third rehab.

42:59.811 --> 43:03.114
Two years.
I've got it pretty wired.

43:03.148 --> 43:06.985
- I can help you get out.
- You could?

43:07.018 --> 43:10.856
First, you have to learn
how to say "shame swirl"

43:10.889 --> 43:12.057
with a straight face.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.159
Time for lights out, girls.

43:14.192 --> 43:15.994
Tomorrow's a new day
to get healthy.

43:16.027 --> 43:17.062
That's right!

43:17.095 --> 43:18.329
You bet!
