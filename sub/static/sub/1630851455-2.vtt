00:04.867 --> 00:07.966
(Could Brand-name Watches
Capture Eternity?)

00:08.747 --> 00:10.377
(Episode 2)

00:10.547 --> 00:13.018
You made such a delicious dinner,
and you're doing the dishes too.

00:13.518 --> 00:15.317
You really don't have to do this.

00:15.317 --> 00:18.557
Come on, the beginning
and the end of cooking...

00:18.557 --> 00:21.057
goes from preparing the ingredients
to doing the dishes.

00:21.798 --> 00:25.627
Did you know Leonardo da Vinci
wanted to be a chef first?

00:27.298 --> 00:29.538
(Da Vinci Restaurant)

00:29.538 --> 00:31.708
Did he really?

00:32.107 --> 00:33.307
He even had a restaurant.

00:33.307 --> 00:35.807
He called it
The Three Frogs of Sandro and Leonardo.

00:35.807 --> 00:37.308
He didn't open it in Korea, did he?

00:38.108 --> 00:39.947
- Sorry?
- If he opened it in Korea,

00:39.947 --> 00:41.547
I'd have to know.

00:41.547 --> 00:42.547
I may not look much,

00:42.547 --> 00:44.888
but I am a board member
of the Korea Restaurant Association.

00:50.017 --> 00:53.358
Mr. Jin, you're hilarious.

00:53.388 --> 00:56.998
How can you make such jokes
with such a serious face?

00:57.657 --> 00:59.068
I didn't make a joke.

00:59.168 --> 01:01.297
I'm a serious and taciturn type.

01:02.967 --> 01:04.068
That again.

01:07.118 --> 01:08.558
This is insane.

01:09.878 --> 01:12.807
I didn't even drink,
but why do I feel tipsy?

01:13.007 --> 01:14.408
I'm sorry?

01:15.878 --> 01:19.848
I mean, we were strangers
up until yesterday,

01:20.147 --> 01:23.218
but we had dinner,
we're having a chat,

01:24.057 --> 01:25.128
and we're laughing together.

01:25.628 --> 01:28.527
Everything seems so odd.
It kind of feels like a dream.

01:29.628 --> 01:30.997
Maybe it's jet lag.

01:31.727 --> 01:33.628
It is a rather special relationship.

01:34.167 --> 01:35.637
According to "Brahma's Net Sutra,"

01:35.637 --> 01:39.068
we finally met after 3,000 geops.
That's us.

01:40.768 --> 01:41.878
"Us"?

01:42.208 --> 01:44.438
Buddhists explain
people's relationships...

01:44.438 --> 01:47.107
in terms of a unit of time
called geop.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.718
Once every 100 years,

01:48.718 --> 01:51.688
a drop of water
would fall over a rock.

01:51.848 --> 01:54.488
A geop is the time it takes
for those water drops...

01:54.488 --> 01:55.917
to wear that rock away.

01:56.488 --> 01:59.357
And we needed 3,000 geops of time...

01:59.357 --> 02:01.598
to meet like this...

02:01.697 --> 02:03.997
and spend a night together.

02:04.098 --> 02:06.697
That's how precious
this connection is.

02:08.637 --> 02:09.738
I see.

02:17.808 --> 02:19.648
Is there anything I can do to help?

02:21.047 --> 02:22.577
No, I got it.

02:36.098 --> 02:38.167
Three thousand geop of time.

02:53.908 --> 02:57.348
That's it. What a day.

03:10.128 --> 03:11.197
What?

03:12.398 --> 03:13.598
What's going on now?

03:14.767 --> 03:16.098
Come on.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.177
Da Li?

03:24.577 --> 03:27.248
Da Li, what's going on?

03:28.007 --> 03:29.718
What is it? Where are you?

03:35.218 --> 03:36.718
Da Li?

03:38.017 --> 03:39.957
Da Li?

03:43.757 --> 03:45.128
Da Li?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.598
Da Li?

03:50.697 --> 03:51.838
Da Li...

04:25.237 --> 04:28.377
It must've been a blackout.
It sometimes happens.

04:30.338 --> 04:31.508
Are you hurt?

04:32.078 --> 04:34.278
I'm fine. What about you?

04:35.078 --> 04:36.578
I'm also fine.

04:40.817 --> 04:42.018
You're heavy.

04:42.788 --> 04:43.788
Right.

04:46.357 --> 04:47.958
Wait, one second.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.328
Your eyes.
Could you close your eyes?

04:51.328 --> 04:53.367
- My eyes?
- Your eyes.

04:53.367 --> 04:55.497
- Your eyes.
- My eyes.

04:56.538 --> 04:58.937
Please don't open them
until I'm out of the room.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.338
- Don't, okay?
- Okay.

05:01.338 --> 05:02.677
Don't open your eyes.

05:03.778 --> 05:06.078
- Don't open them.
- Okay.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.417
Don't open your eyes.

05:34.867 --> 05:37.477
What? Hey, what?

05:37.477 --> 05:39.508
Did something happen?
No, not at all.

05:39.508 --> 05:42.278
I was pretty cool. I was all right.

05:42.278 --> 05:43.747
I was pretty awesome.

05:45.917 --> 05:47.648
That's freezing.

05:57.528 --> 05:59.497
All right. Bye.

06:00.497 --> 06:03.398
Yes, I understand.
I'll see you in a few.

06:08.778 --> 06:10.138
What did she say?

06:16.247 --> 06:18.817
Why? She's going to sue me?

06:20.487 --> 06:22.987
Is she still insisting
her fake painting is genuine?

06:25.788 --> 06:26.958
Don't worry.

06:26.958 --> 06:30.557
I'll do everything it takes
to keep you away from trouble.

06:30.627 --> 06:32.598
I have excellent lawyers.

06:32.598 --> 06:35.098
I pay them a lot.
Almost unbelievably.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.807
Madam Bronckhorst
asked to tell you...

06:42.138 --> 06:43.708
that she's grateful.

06:46.508 --> 06:47.778
For me? Why?

06:48.078 --> 06:50.078
She hasn't paid off
the painting in full,

06:50.078 --> 06:52.617
but she found out it was fake
thanks to you, Mr. Jin.

06:52.648 --> 06:54.588
I don't think
she'll sue you or report you.

06:54.588 --> 06:57.588
She probably thought nothing good
will come from blowing this up.

06:57.888 --> 07:00.328
People will grow suspicious
of other artworks she keeps.

07:02.458 --> 07:04.958
The problem is Mr. Jin Hitonari.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.398
- I found him.
- Sorry?

07:07.528 --> 07:09.937
He attended the party
for the Hog Raisers Association...

07:09.937 --> 07:11.468
on my behalf with my entourage.

07:20.078 --> 07:23.018
He hit it off with everyone
in the Hog Raisers Association,

07:23.018 --> 07:25.547
so he got wasted
and danced all night.

07:26.088 --> 07:28.317
He's still asleep in the pigpen.

07:30.218 --> 07:32.588
My gosh, that's unbelievable.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.788
What a relief.

07:36.898 --> 07:38.028
But...

07:39.268 --> 07:40.828
I have bad news.

07:43.468 --> 07:45.607
My staff has arrived.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.867
So I have to be on my way.

07:48.908 --> 07:50.977
I see. Is that so?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.687
The weather is nice.

09:06.288 --> 09:08.858
I'm glad everything went well
just as you planned.

09:11.288 --> 09:14.358
What did I tell you?
I told you everything will be fine.

09:15.128 --> 09:16.597
Where are your staff?

09:18.567 --> 09:20.197
They already arrived.

09:22.837 --> 09:25.408
- I'll be on my way then.
- Wait, Da Li.

09:28.408 --> 09:29.707
Thank you...

09:31.278 --> 09:32.447
for yesterday.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.803
Thanks to you,
I had a great time as well.

09:37.772 --> 09:38.772
Goodbye, then.

09:39.142 --> 09:40.142
Wait.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.282
I'll be quite busy until tomorrow.

09:48.652 --> 09:51.083
I have numerous things to look over
since it's an important matter.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.652
And before that,
I need to visit some pigpens.

09:54.453 --> 09:56.892
I've already purchased
a round-trip ticket,

09:56.892 --> 10:00.833
so I have no choice but to fly out
the day after tomorrow.

10:01.333 --> 10:03.563
Then I have a number of meetings
lined up in Korea as well.

10:04.402 --> 10:06.703
I also need to report back
regarding the contract.

10:09.772 --> 10:11.343
That's my situation.

10:14.272 --> 10:15.313
What a shame.

10:16.382 --> 10:18.113
Had you had some free time,

10:18.113 --> 10:21.922
you would've been able to visit
some beautiful sights.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.282
Still, I'm going to make sure
to visit your gallery.

10:24.723 --> 10:25.792
Sorry?

10:25.792 --> 10:27.492
I'm going to make time...

10:27.992 --> 10:29.792
and visit your gallery at all costs.

10:30.522 --> 10:34.132
I'm going to see
those impressionist paintings...

10:34.132 --> 10:35.303
that Koreans love so much.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.162
Then I'm going to visit
that cafeteria...

10:37.162 --> 10:39.772
that serves good food
although it's not as tasty as mine.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.073
I'd also like to see you again.

10:48.912 --> 10:51.142
Okay. Sounds good.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.622
I'll be there no matter what,
so wait for me. Okay?

10:57.453 --> 10:58.622
You have to.

11:00.723 --> 11:01.723
Goodbye, then.

11:02.823 --> 11:03.892
Wait.

11:11.532 --> 11:13.502
Mr. Jin?

11:18.002 --> 11:20.012
That watch means a lot to me.

11:20.372 --> 11:22.742
So please bring it with you
next time we meet.

11:23.113 --> 11:24.183
You must.

11:25.012 --> 11:26.313
Mr. Jin.

11:50.303 --> 11:51.372
Yes!

11:53.142 --> 11:55.382
Hi.

12:04.493 --> 12:06.332
Wait. Which gallery was it?

12:06.993 --> 12:08.603
I don't even know her number.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.302
Hold on. Sorry.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.773
Darn it.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.123
Da Li.

13:17.103 --> 13:18.702
Watch where you're going!

13:20.332 --> 13:21.432
Da Li!

13:30.383 --> 13:31.412
Da Li!

13:34.552 --> 13:35.552
Da Li...

14:03.743 --> 14:04.782
Sign here.

14:05.853 --> 14:06.983
Sign here.

14:13.493 --> 14:15.922
How could we
possibly find someone...

14:15.922 --> 14:17.662
solely with an unverified name?

14:18.263 --> 14:19.593
Didn't you also visit her house?

14:20.893 --> 14:22.062
What was the name
of the neighborhood?

14:22.532 --> 14:23.733
How would I know...

14:23.733 --> 14:25.302
when we drove there
in the middle of the night?

14:27.973 --> 14:29.503
Is it at least in Amsterdam?

14:31.542 --> 14:32.542
I'm not too sure.

14:47.993 --> 14:50.322
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.162
No, I wasn't.

14:53.162 --> 14:55.802
Look. Hear me out.

14:55.932 --> 14:58.633
I cooked for her
and even made her laugh.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.172
Right. I even attended a party...

15:01.172 --> 15:03.542
and put a hole
in a 160-million-dollar painting.

15:05.643 --> 15:07.513
One dollar and sixty cents?

15:08.312 --> 15:09.383
Come on.

15:09.383 --> 15:12.782
I said 160 million dollars. Million!

15:12.782 --> 15:13.883
Da Li!

15:13.883 --> 15:15.682
You were indeed dreaming.

15:17.853 --> 15:20.052
Hold on. Sir.

15:21.093 --> 15:23.093
- Where's your watch?
- What do you mean?

15:23.523 --> 15:24.993
Your wristwatch.

15:25.763 --> 15:27.832
I told you not to take it with you
since it was expensive.

15:27.832 --> 15:29.662
There were crow feathers on her hat.

15:29.662 --> 15:30.702
Well...

15:31.532 --> 15:32.633
What's the matter?

15:32.633 --> 15:35.403
What did I do so wrong?
She could've walked by.

15:35.672 --> 15:38.243
Don't tell me she...

15:40.513 --> 15:42.312
There were crow feathers on her hat.

15:42.312 --> 15:43.343
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

15:43.343 --> 15:44.983
Did she sound awfully intelligent?

15:44.983 --> 15:46.613
So much
that you couldn't understand her?

15:46.883 --> 15:47.883
How did you know?

15:48.353 --> 15:51.082
And she laughed
every time you said something.

15:51.452 --> 15:52.493
You're right.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.822
Did she look dense
but have a sharp mind?

15:54.822 --> 15:56.192
Yes, exactly.

15:56.192 --> 15:59.363
We call such women swindlers.

16:00.763 --> 16:01.893
- She just left?
- Yes.

16:02.432 --> 16:03.932
I'm sorry I can't give you
more information.

16:04.263 --> 16:06.003
It's ludicrous to think...

16:06.003 --> 16:08.103
that she quit her job and hid
solely for that watch.

16:08.873 --> 16:10.873
It's possible
if that watch was worth...

16:10.873 --> 16:12.072
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

16:12.843 --> 16:15.172
She was crying
in front of the hotel.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.743
She was acting, of course.

16:18.513 --> 16:21.253
No. She's not the type to do that.

16:21.812 --> 16:23.623
I'm sure she had her reasons.

16:25.792 --> 16:28.792
All swindlers have
their own reasons.

16:32.532 --> 16:35.832
Mr. Jin, you're hilarious.

16:41.903 --> 16:45.473
When someone offers you help,
a thank-you would suffice.

16:47.843 --> 16:49.613
It is a rather special relationship.

16:50.182 --> 16:51.682
According to "Brahma's Net Sutra,"

16:51.682 --> 16:55.082
we finally met after 3,000 geops.
That's us.

16:56.023 --> 16:58.452
That's how precious
this connection is.

17:04.363 --> 17:07.531
How dare you deceive me?

17:09.962 --> 17:13.232
You're dead meat once I catch you.

17:14.103 --> 17:15.903
You, die!

17:23.412 --> 17:27.083
Hello.

17:34.192 --> 17:35.593
Let's move on to art and culture.

17:35.593 --> 17:38.662
A long line of people has attended
Director Kim Nak Chun...

17:38.662 --> 17:41.093
of Cheongsong Gallery's funeral
to offer their condolences.

17:41.633 --> 17:43.162
As the eldest son of Cheongsong,

17:43.162 --> 17:45.932
he had practiced noblesse oblige
throughout his lifetime.

17:46.272 --> 17:48.603
He had also spent his own money...

17:48.603 --> 17:51.103
to help unprivileged children
appreciate art.

17:51.543 --> 17:55.682
He had devoted his entire life,
sharing art with everyone.

17:59.452 --> 18:00.553
We lost...

18:01.353 --> 18:02.922
a great man...

18:03.853 --> 18:05.793
and our oldest uncle unexpectedly...

18:06.992 --> 18:08.222
Please give me a minute.

18:08.393 --> 18:09.422
Here you go.

18:10.563 --> 18:11.593
Thank you.

18:21.732 --> 18:22.803
I'm sorry.

18:24.172 --> 18:26.573
There are no words to express
the pain and sadness...

18:26.843 --> 18:28.813
I'm feeling after losing
such a great man.

18:30.012 --> 18:34.353
However, as the eldest son
and representative of Cheongsong,

18:34.682 --> 18:36.323
I will respect his will...

18:36.323 --> 18:38.853
and manage Cheongsong Gallery
just like he did.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.623
As for the cultural welfare business
that's been ongoing...

18:40.623 --> 18:42.962
Hold on.
Isn't that Jang Tae Jin's car?

18:42.962 --> 18:44.992
- Jang Tae Jin of Segi Group?
- I believe so.

18:44.992 --> 18:46.363
- Jang Tae Jin!
- It's him!

18:46.363 --> 18:48.432
Hold on! I'm not done talking!

18:59.412 --> 19:00.573
Aren't you Mr. Jang Tae Jin?

19:00.573 --> 19:02.143
- How do you feel?
- How are you feeling?

19:02.143 --> 19:04.012
- Move aside.
- Please share a word or two!

19:14.692 --> 19:15.692
We're...

19:18.492 --> 19:20.063
from an auction house.

19:22.533 --> 19:26.732
Word has it that Cheongsong Gallery
is going through a rough patch.

19:27.533 --> 19:31.002
We'll offer much better services
than the other auction houses.

19:31.202 --> 19:32.742
If you need to discard anything,

19:32.742 --> 19:34.043
- Hey.
- feel free to call us.

19:34.043 --> 19:35.043
Wait.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.482
That was rude.
Who do you think you are?

19:40.340 --> 19:42.770
"My condolences for your loss."

19:43.641 --> 19:46.280
That's what you say
to the grief-stricken bereaved family...

19:46.280 --> 19:48.141
when you don't know
how to comfort them.

19:49.411 --> 19:50.711
Memorize it if you don't know that.

19:54.951 --> 19:56.721
I'm sorry.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.391
My condolences.

20:34.491 --> 20:36.731
My condolences for your loss.

20:39.260 --> 20:41.300
Thank you for coming.

20:52.780 --> 20:53.881
Goodness.

20:54.911 --> 20:57.151
That's him, right?
Director Jang Tae Jin of Segi Group.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.280
How dare he come here?

20:59.681 --> 21:01.381
Why? Did something happen
between the two of them?

21:01.750 --> 21:04.320
Didn't you know?
He almost married Da Li, but...

21:04.320 --> 21:05.350
Gosh.

21:06.260 --> 21:07.820
Come on. People can hear you.

21:23.741 --> 21:24.911
Mr. Kim.

21:31.711 --> 21:33.221
You idiot.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
Idiot.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.020
This is a lie, right?

21:41.721 --> 21:43.260
Please tell me this isn't true.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.030
Please tell me...

21:55.441 --> 21:56.941
It's okay, Won Tak.

22:22.971 --> 22:24.431
It looks like
there will be more visitors.

22:24.431 --> 22:26.500
Keep an eye on the bereaved family,
so the visitors don't bother them.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.471
Yes, sir. I'll instruct them so.

22:28.741 --> 22:29.741
And I'd like to know...

22:29.741 --> 22:31.711
about Cheongsong Gallery's
financial situation too.

22:35.411 --> 22:37.810
- Please find out quietly.
- Yes, sir.

22:59.270 --> 23:00.340
Mr. Kim.

23:02.201 --> 23:03.270
Mr. Kim.

23:15.381 --> 23:16.451
Dad.

23:16.451 --> 23:18.891
What were you thinking about?
You were completely out of it.

23:19.391 --> 23:21.020
Gosh. It's nothing.

23:21.961 --> 23:24.191
I just had a lot on my mind.

23:25.431 --> 23:28.201
Moo Hak hasn't come back
to work yet.

23:28.431 --> 23:30.300
Oh, Moo Hak.
He must be under the weather.

23:30.671 --> 23:33.671
He's been working hard
for the deal in the Netherlands.

23:34.070 --> 23:37.270
He said he'd be back tomorrow.
Please don't worry.

23:37.371 --> 23:38.441
Okay.

23:38.810 --> 23:40.110
Right.

23:41.080 --> 23:44.010
What was the name of the gallery?

23:45.810 --> 23:48.350
- Pardon?
- The gallery Moo Hak lent money to.

23:48.350 --> 23:51.250
- Was it...
- Why do you ask?

23:53.121 --> 23:54.691
It's a solid gallery, right?

23:56.431 --> 23:58.860
I'm sure he looked into the gallery
before lending the money.

23:59.661 --> 24:02.701
You know that he's very careful
when it comes to money.

24:03.671 --> 24:05.731
Right. Bye.

24:07.171 --> 24:08.671
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

24:23.921 --> 24:26.621
(Fifty dollars)

24:41.100 --> 24:42.641
Three thousand geops?

24:44.070 --> 24:45.610
What a load of garbage.

24:46.641 --> 24:49.280
With the way she talked
about Buddha and Confucius,

24:49.280 --> 24:51.250
she totally won me over.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.651
And then she stole my watch.

24:54.820 --> 24:55.881
Gosh.

24:56.221 --> 24:58.520
Seriously.
The minute hand itself costs...

24:59.121 --> 25:01.191
Do you know how many bowls
of gamjatang that's worth?

25:01.191 --> 25:02.691
Come on.

25:03.790 --> 25:04.830
That hurts.

25:08.901 --> 25:09.931
It's hot.

25:10.131 --> 25:11.471
Come on!

25:16.211 --> 25:19.580
No way.

25:20.411 --> 25:24.250
I must eat well in times like this
so I can get my energy up. Right.

25:28.151 --> 25:29.691
If she's hiding in the North Pole,

25:29.790 --> 25:31.820
I'll strangle the penguins.

25:32.391 --> 25:33.760
And if she's hiding
in the South Pole,

25:33.760 --> 25:35.621
I'll punch the polar bears
in the solar plexus.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.431
I will find her at all costs.

25:37.431 --> 25:38.760
At all costs!

25:39.560 --> 25:41.701
Polar bears live in the North Pole.

25:41.701 --> 25:44.070
And penguins live in the South Pole.

25:45.471 --> 25:47.141
You startled me.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.570
Did you come over here
to point out my mistake?

25:50.570 --> 25:51.610
When I'm sick?

25:51.810 --> 25:54.481
You sounded awfully sick
on the phone.

25:54.481 --> 25:56.211
I was worried
that you didn't have any food.

25:56.211 --> 25:57.750
So I thought...

25:59.451 --> 26:00.520
Gosh.

26:02.250 --> 26:05.250
I'm not dead yet.
Why would I skip my meals?

26:06.260 --> 26:07.260
Right.

26:07.661 --> 26:11.760
Why did I worry about you and food?
That's so pointless.

26:17.471 --> 26:18.631
Gosh.

26:20.641 --> 26:21.701
That looks good.

26:21.701 --> 26:23.610
How are things in the Netherlands?

26:25.570 --> 26:27.280
Well, you see...

26:30.711 --> 26:32.850
I paid the private investigator
very handsomely.

26:32.850 --> 26:35.520
How can a private investigator
struggle to find a girl?

26:36.350 --> 26:38.250
That's the Netherlands for you.

26:38.350 --> 26:42.191
There's no culture
of expediting cases like we do here.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.030
Call the private investigator again.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.530
Tell him as soon as he finds her,

26:46.530 --> 26:47.830
he'll get ten times
the retainer I paid him.

26:47.830 --> 26:50.570
Okay. What? Ten times?

26:51.330 --> 26:53.741
It's not like I can rush him
because he's not here.

26:53.741 --> 26:55.371
I need him to see how much
I'm willing to pay to get this done.

26:55.371 --> 26:56.971
That way, he'll take this seriously.

27:02.181 --> 27:04.310
I have a question.

27:07.481 --> 27:10.891
Are you trying to find the watch?
Or that girl?

27:11.191 --> 27:12.520
Of course, it's...

27:19.161 --> 27:20.431
the watch!

27:20.530 --> 27:22.600
Right. It's the watch. Yes.

27:23.431 --> 27:24.600
I almost thought it was the girl.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.721
(Samgwang Movers)

27:50.731 --> 27:52.860
Did you try to get an extension
from the bank...

27:52.860 --> 27:54.931
regarding the maturity date
for the loan?

27:56.371 --> 27:59.201
Well, everyone was busy.

28:00.340 --> 28:02.401
I'm going back to the bank today.

28:02.701 --> 28:05.671
This is the list of the loans
he took out.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.651
The gallery is in much worse shape
than I thought.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.850
I knew that...

28:12.850 --> 28:15.850
running a private gallery was
like pouring water into a sieve.

28:15.850 --> 28:17.850
But I had no idea
that it was this bad.

28:19.391 --> 28:23.330
He donated all of his money
and assets to charities...

28:23.330 --> 28:26.560
and only kept a gallery
that's about to go bankrupt.

28:27.860 --> 28:30.731
And he didn't even have any helpers
to maintain a mansion like this.

28:33.971 --> 28:36.441
Even though we've been friends
for 40 years...

28:37.510 --> 28:39.741
I don't know if I respect him,

28:39.941 --> 28:41.810
or find him stupid.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.481
What a foolish person.

28:49.280 --> 28:52.350
I'm thinking about getting rid of
all my assets to save the gallery.

28:53.121 --> 28:54.560
Including this house.

28:56.121 --> 28:59.161
If you can help me find
an appropriate buyer...

28:59.161 --> 29:02.560
Land that has development
restrictions won't sell for much.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.631
On top of that,
the bank has it as collateral.

29:07.570 --> 29:09.911
The inheritance tax will hit soon.

29:09.911 --> 29:11.510
Do you have any plans for that?

29:15.780 --> 29:17.151
Perhaps...

29:18.280 --> 29:20.681
you might have to give up
the inheritance.

29:33.500 --> 29:35.560
Where are you headed in that state?

29:35.800 --> 29:37.431
I have to stop by the hospital.

29:37.431 --> 29:39.330
And some bank stuff to take care of.

29:39.671 --> 29:42.600
If it's bank stuff,
you can make me do it.

29:42.800 --> 29:45.510
Why would I ask for your help
when it's my personal business?

29:49.881 --> 29:51.750
How would I trust you?

30:02.520 --> 30:04.461
I'm really in a hurry.

30:04.461 --> 30:06.030
The payment due date is nearing,

30:06.030 --> 30:08.431
but I can't find or reach him.

30:08.961 --> 30:12.100
If you tell me where he is,
I can personally go find him.

30:12.830 --> 30:14.371
I beg of you.

30:14.471 --> 30:18.110
He's not in Korea right now.

30:18.641 --> 30:19.711
Excuse me?

30:19.711 --> 30:22.340
He's in South Africa for the
International Finance Symposium.

30:22.340 --> 30:24.010
He won't be back for a while.

30:24.010 --> 30:26.211
He's going straight from
South Africa to Stockholm.

30:27.080 --> 30:28.520
Because of the Global Economy Forum.

30:28.921 --> 30:32.991
And he said he was going to New York
for his daughter's wedding, so...

30:33.290 --> 30:35.491
I'm not sure when he'll be back.

30:47.500 --> 30:48.600
Sir.

30:50.871 --> 30:52.411
Da Li!

30:53.280 --> 30:55.310
When did he get back to Korea?

31:00.320 --> 31:02.780
I've never paid my interest late,

31:02.780 --> 31:04.750
and my credit isn't bad.

31:05.721 --> 31:08.020
If you suddenly tell me
I need to pay all the money back...

31:09.760 --> 31:11.631
I'm begging you.

31:12.491 --> 31:15.161
I'll handle this
as soon as possible, so...

31:18.500 --> 31:19.500
Sir.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.701
No, I'm begging you, Da Li.

31:23.941 --> 31:25.840
Please save my life, okay?

31:26.510 --> 31:29.750
I'm about to die
because of your father.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.451
It's not about the credit.

31:32.850 --> 31:35.050
Your father was credit itself.

31:35.350 --> 31:38.391
But he died, without telling me.

31:39.991 --> 31:43.260
I hear rumors that the Cheongsong Gallery
will be handed over.

31:44.790 --> 31:46.661
Let's deal with the bank situation,

31:46.931 --> 31:49.231
even if that means making everything
else slide for now, okay?

31:50.530 --> 31:52.270
That's what we have to do.

31:54.570 --> 31:55.570
Da Li.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.610
We're no strangers.

31:59.411 --> 32:02.381
I'm your father's friend.

32:03.381 --> 32:05.381
Da Li, please.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.181
Please, save my life.

32:09.151 --> 32:10.221
Please?

32:33.810 --> 32:35.881
Your bank errand was just
checking your bank book?

32:36.241 --> 32:38.151
Look away.

32:39.451 --> 32:40.820
With just a banking app,

32:40.820 --> 32:42.481
you can check transactions,
transfer money, and exchange currency.

32:42.481 --> 32:44.151
That's the world we live in.

32:44.520 --> 32:47.520
Who uses a bank book?

32:48.691 --> 32:51.231
Money is only real when you can
touch it with your hands,

32:51.231 --> 32:54.760
see it with your eyes,
and printed in numbers.

32:55.100 --> 32:58.070
Are you going to take care of it
if my account gets hacked?

32:58.300 --> 33:01.100
I don't understand how such
an untrusting, wary person...

33:01.100 --> 33:03.340
fell for a total stranger...

33:03.340 --> 33:05.040
and lost his expensive watch.

33:05.040 --> 33:07.741
I didn't fall for anyone!

33:09.411 --> 33:10.481
Sure.

33:15.481 --> 33:16.550
Sure.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.550
(Balance: 84,000 dollars)

33:44.981 --> 33:46.921
The rent didn't come in again.

33:47.481 --> 33:49.681
- Was she pretty?
- What?

33:50.421 --> 33:53.560
That woman. Was she pretty?
The Netherlands.

33:53.691 --> 33:55.461
It's nothing like that.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.491
Or maybe she had a rocking body.

34:00.260 --> 34:01.731
It's not like that.

34:01.731 --> 34:05.671
If that's not it, did she drug you?
Like a sleeping pill.

34:05.671 --> 34:06.800
I swear...

34:07.641 --> 34:08.871
Then what is it?

34:09.170 --> 34:11.911
What did she do to you...

34:12.541 --> 34:14.210
that you didn't even notice
your watch was gone?

34:14.741 --> 34:16.440
Based on your personality,

34:16.610 --> 34:20.320
you wouldn't have just put it around
her wrist unless you went crazy.

34:23.121 --> 34:25.150
- Goodbye, then.
- Wait.

34:26.521 --> 34:27.690
I'm sorry.

34:34.331 --> 34:36.201
Mr. Jin?

34:37.201 --> 34:39.271
That watch means a lot to me.

34:39.630 --> 34:41.871
So please bring it with you
next time we meet.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.411
You must.

34:45.641 --> 34:47.780
Of course not.

34:49.241 --> 34:50.480
Unless I went crazy.

35:07.931 --> 35:08.960
What is it?

35:10.271 --> 35:11.831
Nothing.

35:12.271 --> 35:13.541
I think I am seeing things.

35:15.800 --> 35:18.110
Do you think that woman
came back to Korea?

35:18.110 --> 35:19.371
No way.

35:20.010 --> 35:22.510
The best kind of running away
is running away abroad.

35:23.181 --> 35:24.181
Right?

35:28.221 --> 35:31.690
Officer, he got drunk
and hit me first.

35:31.690 --> 35:33.561
- I know, but...
- It's not your first time.

35:33.561 --> 35:36.090
- Officer!
- Make him shut up!

35:36.090 --> 35:37.360
What?

35:37.360 --> 35:39.061
- This scum...
- I didn't drink.

35:39.061 --> 35:41.300
- You ran into...
- Just one.

35:41.300 --> 35:43.530
You always drink and then do this!

35:43.530 --> 35:45.530
Be quiet, lady.

35:45.530 --> 35:48.101
Did you just call me a lady?

35:48.101 --> 35:50.110
Please sit down, ma'am.

35:50.110 --> 35:51.710
Aren't you one?

35:51.710 --> 35:54.081
- What are you talking about?
- Officer.

35:54.081 --> 35:55.440
I just said...

35:55.440 --> 35:57.811
I'm here to see Joo Won Tak.

35:58.550 --> 36:00.050
Everyone shut up!

36:01.721 --> 36:02.721
What did you say?

36:03.351 --> 36:05.391
I'm here to see Joo Won Tak.

36:05.820 --> 36:08.121
He's not in today.
Did you call before coming?

36:08.360 --> 36:09.991
I don't have his number.

36:09.991 --> 36:11.831
I just heard he works here.

36:11.831 --> 36:12.831
Come back tomorrow.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.501
Or you can leave your number here.

36:19.070 --> 36:20.141
Excuse me.

36:22.501 --> 36:23.570
(173 Seongsui-ro,
Seongdong-gu, Seoul)

36:23.570 --> 36:25.010
Try calling this number.

36:25.610 --> 36:28.980
After the director passed,
he wouldn't eat or sleep.

36:29.610 --> 36:31.050
At this point, he might also die.

36:33.721 --> 36:35.521
- Thank you.
- Of course.

36:42.061 --> 36:43.791
We don't know her.
How could you just give away his number?

36:44.590 --> 36:45.630
Hey.

36:49.601 --> 36:50.601
Look.

36:52.300 --> 36:55.141
This woman is her?

36:55.141 --> 36:56.911
- That's right.
- She's pretty.

36:56.911 --> 36:59.471
- She's pretty!
- Darn it.

37:00.081 --> 37:02.010
Sir, go sit down.

37:31.371 --> 37:35.940
I told you to get an IV
while you were at the hospital.

37:35.940 --> 37:37.150
It doesn't cost that much.

37:37.150 --> 37:39.451
I didn't get it because
I didn't need it.

37:39.911 --> 37:42.081
You think I didn't get it
because of the money?

37:42.081 --> 37:44.221
Seems like it.

37:45.920 --> 37:46.960
I guess...

37:46.960 --> 37:48.760
when you blow away a watch worth
hundreds of thousands of dollars...

37:48.760 --> 37:51.090
you do need to save
as much as possible.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.831
Why do you keep bringing it up?

37:53.831 --> 37:55.001
I'll find it.

37:55.501 --> 37:58.601
Even if I have to follow her
to the ends of the earth,

37:58.601 --> 38:00.871
I'll find it.

38:01.271 --> 38:02.340
Sure.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.541
Drop me off here and go home.

38:07.340 --> 38:09.081
Why? I'll take you home.

38:09.081 --> 38:11.210
No. I have to stop by the pharmacy.

38:30.300 --> 38:32.871
(173 Seongsui-ro)

38:57.090 --> 38:59.260
(Remember to pay your rent on time!)

39:24.521 --> 39:25.650
You again?

39:26.491 --> 39:28.661
Why are you at a police station...

39:28.661 --> 39:31.291
more than your school
when you're still a student?

39:31.760 --> 39:33.491
Taxpayers pay money...

39:33.491 --> 39:35.431
to feed you and shelter you
at a children's home.

39:35.431 --> 39:38.601
Then you should be grateful
and live your life quietly.

39:38.971 --> 39:41.001
Kids like you are...

39:41.241 --> 39:44.041
the reason why orphans get shunned.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.980
People say you grew up like this
because you weren't taught properly.

39:47.380 --> 39:48.411
Look at you.

39:49.510 --> 39:52.780
This orphan has
the eyes of a poisonous snake.

39:52.780 --> 39:55.081
Lower your eyes. Lower them.

39:59.320 --> 40:00.521
Who are you?

40:01.960 --> 40:04.190
Knives aren't the only way
to stab people.

40:04.391 --> 40:06.530
It's impossible to recover
when you stab people by words.

40:06.630 --> 40:08.561
It stays there for life,
stuck in people's hearts.

40:09.001 --> 40:10.771
- What?
- Why do you attack him?

40:10.771 --> 40:12.831
What did Won Tak do wrong?

40:13.001 --> 40:14.670
One, two, three, four, five.

40:14.670 --> 40:17.610
If 5 fought against 1,
the 1 is obviously the victim.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.380
These five kids
attacked him at once.

40:20.380 --> 40:22.710
It's not just an assault,
it's considered a special assault.

40:22.710 --> 40:25.710
You just abused a victim
of a special assault case...

40:25.710 --> 40:28.280
physically, mentally, and verbally.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.050
Do not erase the CCTV footage.

40:30.050 --> 40:33.320
I already recorded
everything on my phone.

40:34.360 --> 40:36.891
- Who's this psycho?
- My daughter.

40:36.891 --> 40:38.561
(Violent Crime Unit 1)

40:41.730 --> 40:43.130
Isn't he a part
of the Cheongsong family?

40:43.130 --> 40:45.101
Kim Nak Chun of Cheongsong family?

40:45.101 --> 40:46.331
- Who's that?
- It's him, right?

40:48.570 --> 40:51.541
And this kid is my son.

40:56.710 --> 40:58.280
I heard that...

40:59.210 --> 41:03.081
these kids were
harassing a disabled kid.

41:04.150 --> 41:07.090
My son tried to stop them,
then got into a fight.

41:09.420 --> 41:10.460
Is that right?

41:16.130 --> 41:18.130
That's how I taught him.

41:18.971 --> 41:21.241
I taught him to use his power
for the less fortunate.

41:22.840 --> 41:24.971
Did I teach him the wrong way?

41:26.411 --> 41:28.980
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize who he was.

41:29.510 --> 41:31.380
I apologize for my behavior.

41:32.710 --> 41:35.521
Let's go over there
for a cup of tea...

41:35.521 --> 41:36.951
No.

41:37.190 --> 41:39.521
You need to apologize to my son.

41:40.460 --> 41:42.221
If you apologize sincerely,

41:42.521 --> 41:44.860
I know my son will
accept your apology.

41:49.760 --> 41:50.871
Sorry...

41:55.041 --> 41:56.541
about what happened.

42:03.880 --> 42:05.780
Aren't you hungry? Eat up.

42:07.420 --> 42:09.021
Stop minding my business.

42:09.021 --> 42:11.391
And why did you call the director?

42:14.190 --> 42:17.360
We're family.
How can I not mind you?

42:20.190 --> 42:22.530
If I get beaten up by other kids,

42:23.460 --> 42:24.701
will you turn away?

42:24.701 --> 42:27.300
Yes, I'll turn away.

42:28.471 --> 42:30.201
You liar.

42:30.201 --> 42:31.741
I'm not lying.

(The 2010 Police Officer Recruitment)

42:41.751 --> 42:42.980
My gosh.

42:44.920 --> 42:46.451
They look so cool.

42:46.891 --> 42:47.991
What?

42:51.831 --> 42:52.860
What do you want?

42:53.900 --> 42:56.900
Men look the coolest in uniforms.
Don't you think?

42:57.701 --> 42:59.001
(The 2010 Police Officer Recruitment)

42:59.170 --> 43:00.601
Cool, my foot.

43:01.201 --> 43:04.610
Won Tak will look
even cooler in this uniform.

43:05.440 --> 43:08.010
- Don't you think so, Won Tak?
- Don't you think so, Won Tak?

43:28.300 --> 43:29.561
Who's that?

43:31.630 --> 43:33.670
Darn it, this is so annoying.

43:39.911 --> 43:41.010
Hey.

43:42.940 --> 43:44.610
Did I wake you?

43:45.251 --> 43:47.550
No, it's fine. How did you find me?

43:47.780 --> 43:49.251
People at the police station
told me.

43:49.251 --> 43:50.650
You wouldn't pick up.

43:50.650 --> 43:52.121
Right. Yes.

43:52.891 --> 43:55.521
- May I come in?
- Of course, sure.

43:56.760 --> 43:57.960
You can't come in here!

43:58.991 --> 44:00.960
No, Da Li. Give me five...

44:00.960 --> 44:02.900
No, ten minutes, okay?

44:02.900 --> 44:06.201
Just ten minutes.
But you can't come in, okay?

44:16.880 --> 44:18.510
Darn it. Seriously?

45:07.360 --> 45:10.001
What? He was home.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.530
No, wait.

45:13.530 --> 45:15.440
He was a man, not a woman.

45:28.420 --> 45:30.820
Sorry for making you wait.
Come on in.

45:44.771 --> 45:48.501
Oh, I have to take out
the recyclables tomorrow.

45:52.141 --> 45:53.940

45:56.980 --> 45:58.181
"Remember to pay your rent..."

45:58.780 --> 46:00.181
That crazy jerk.

46:00.181 --> 46:02.050
- What?
- What?

46:02.420 --> 46:03.721
No, it's nothing.

46:04.951 --> 46:07.860
There's a psycho...
I mean, the landlord downstairs.

46:07.991 --> 46:11.130
And it looks like
he has serious psychological issues.

46:11.730 --> 46:13.190
- I see.
- Yes.

46:24.170 --> 46:29.081
I'm glad I took the day off!

46:30.081 --> 46:31.150
This is for you.

46:34.847 --> 46:36.016
What's this?

46:36.177 --> 46:38.347
Roll cake. You love that.

46:42.516 --> 46:43.657
And what's this?

46:45.326 --> 46:48.697
My dad always said
he doesn't want condolence money.

46:49.697 --> 46:52.626
Thank you for staying with me
and mourning with me...

46:52.927 --> 46:55.137
as I sent my dad away.

46:55.367 --> 46:56.697
I'll just take the thought.

46:57.467 --> 46:58.666
Mr. Kim was...

47:01.106 --> 47:02.677
like a father to me.

47:03.837 --> 47:05.907
He wasn't just a sponsor
of my children's home.

47:10.076 --> 47:13.047
Or was I just being presumptuous
all by myself?

47:18.626 --> 47:21.527
My dad would've been
very happy to hear this from you.

47:23.056 --> 47:24.166
You know, right?

47:24.927 --> 47:27.427
He also thought of you as his own.

47:34.737 --> 47:36.677
That's why it's even more painful.

47:39.576 --> 47:43.246
I've always known
that I loved and respected him.

47:44.746 --> 47:46.487
But I never once said them out loud.

47:49.657 --> 47:51.056
I should've hugged him.

47:51.927 --> 47:54.626
Right? I should've at least
held his hand.

47:57.797 --> 47:59.027
Before he passed away,

47:59.726 --> 48:01.467
he told me to visit him.

48:04.467 --> 48:06.507
I can't believe
I didn't make time for him.

48:07.266 --> 48:08.907
I don't deserve to be human.

48:13.777 --> 48:16.547
We don't openly express
our feelings to our family.

48:18.087 --> 48:19.686
We just assume...

48:21.356 --> 48:23.286
that they'll understand us.

48:28.556 --> 48:30.757
So I'm sure he understood you.

48:30.927 --> 48:32.726
I'm sure
he was aware of your feelings.

48:33.726 --> 48:35.436
And he was always proud of you.

48:43.277 --> 48:46.047
Darn it. What are you doing?

48:47.246 --> 48:48.876
Shouldn't I
be comforting you instead?

48:56.817 --> 48:58.087
Are you there?

48:59.387 --> 49:02.226
I'm your landlord.
I need to have a word with you.

49:02.226 --> 49:03.496
- Are you in there?
- Shouldn't you go out?

49:04.126 --> 49:07.496
Are you in there?

49:07.496 --> 49:09.996
Are you in there? Are you?

49:12.467 --> 49:14.436
I'm busy right now,
so let's take a rain check.

49:15.637 --> 49:19.146
Stop right there.
We're not taking any rain checks.

49:19.277 --> 49:20.847
I'll just cut into the chase.

49:20.847 --> 49:22.876
When will you pay your rent?

49:23.916 --> 49:24.947
"Cut into the chase"?

49:25.987 --> 49:27.047
Did you mean "cut to the chase"?

49:27.047 --> 49:29.657
- When will you pay up?
- Wait!

49:33.887 --> 49:35.427
That's enough.

49:35.427 --> 49:37.626
You don't need to shout.
I'm not deaf.

49:38.067 --> 49:39.666
I'll wire it to you by tomorrow.
Happy?

49:39.666 --> 49:42.797
How can I trust you?
You've said that numerous times.

by 10 a.m. tomorrow,

49:47.306 --> 49:50.337

49:51.407 --> 49:53.646
Violent Crimes Unit? It's just rent.

49:54.976 --> 49:56.047
Okay?

49:56.976 --> 49:58.786
Sure. Okay.

50:02.757 --> 50:04.757
I thought you were living alone.

50:04.757 --> 50:07.126
What's it to you
if I live alone or not?

50:07.326 --> 50:10.157
Of course, it matters!

50:10.157 --> 50:12.597
That'll double
your electricity and water bills!

50:12.597 --> 50:13.666
Oh, come on.

50:14.337 --> 50:16.797
What are you looking at?

50:19.367 --> 50:21.036
I knew something was up.

50:21.036 --> 50:23.137
The washing machine was working
all night long,

50:23.137 --> 50:25.606
and the water bill increased
by ten dollars.

50:26.277 --> 50:27.306
You got it wrong.

50:28.016 --> 50:29.416
I'm living alone.

50:31.717 --> 50:33.746
What is it? What's the matter?

50:45.326 --> 50:47.967
- Is that the landlord?
- What? You must be hungry.

50:47.967 --> 50:50.436
I'll cook you something tasty.
What would you like?

50:51.106 --> 50:53.806
Gosh. Darn it.

51:13.527 --> 51:15.826
Darn it.

51:22.436 --> 51:23.936
Why today of all days?

51:24.967 --> 51:26.407
Hop in.
I'll drop you off on my way to work.

51:27.206 --> 51:30.337
That's okay. You said it was urgent.
You should go.

51:31.376 --> 51:32.847
I still have time to drop you off.

51:34.206 --> 51:35.947
I need to meet with someone.

51:37.217 --> 51:38.246
At this hour?

51:38.887 --> 51:39.887
Yes.

51:41.487 --> 51:44.186
(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

52:03.606 --> 52:04.746
Da Li.

52:29.867 --> 52:30.936
Dad.

52:35.706 --> 52:37.376
I'm sorry for being late.

52:45.617 --> 52:47.286
What do you mean?

52:47.347 --> 52:49.257
The director of the gallery died?

52:51.356 --> 52:53.786
Is that true? Is he really dead?

52:54.326 --> 52:55.326
Yes, sir.

52:55.326 --> 52:57.326
Why am I just finding out
about this?

52:57.967 --> 53:01.266
We returned from the Netherlands
later than we had expected.

53:01.597 --> 53:02.666
I'm sorry.

53:03.337 --> 53:04.396
Wait.

53:06.967 --> 53:08.036
Let's go.

53:08.036 --> 53:09.436
Darn it.

53:10.337 --> 53:11.447
You little...

53:15.277 --> 53:17.217
Did two million dollars
sound like nothing to you...

53:17.447 --> 53:19.317
since you've been making some money?

53:20.887 --> 53:22.587
What kind of a fool doesn't know...

53:22.587 --> 53:25.226
if the person he has lent money to
is dead or alive?

53:25.487 --> 53:28.326
The bank is already aware of this!

53:28.956 --> 53:31.396
How dare you think
about starting your own business?

53:32.427 --> 53:36.637
Someone who doesn't value money
will never become successful.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.337
What will you do?

53:39.007 --> 53:40.837
How will you get that money back?

53:42.007 --> 53:43.306
He may have died,

53:43.306 --> 53:45.547
but he must've left behind
his fortune.

53:46.076 --> 53:49.047
Cheongsong is an elite family.

53:49.047 --> 53:52.117
I'm positive
he didn't swindle our money.

53:52.117 --> 53:54.186
His paintings alone are worth
a hefty amount.

53:54.186 --> 53:56.416
Everyone knows that
he's been bankrupt for some time.

53:56.416 --> 53:58.927
Elite family, my foot!

53:59.257 --> 54:01.257
He had borrowed money
from many people!

54:01.257 --> 54:03.856
They're going to auction off
the paintings too!

54:06.097 --> 54:07.197
You said it was promising.

54:07.697 --> 54:10.097
You said you were
absolutely positive.

54:10.467 --> 54:13.837
You said this would reap
20 million dollars!

54:14.706 --> 54:16.576
I'll take responsibility, then!

54:16.576 --> 54:18.706
What? Look at you!

54:18.706 --> 54:21.777
Don't get all worked up
over something so trivial.

54:22.016 --> 54:25.516
I'm your son, Dad. I'm Jin Moo Hak.

54:25.617 --> 54:27.646
No one has ever swindled money
from me.

54:27.646 --> 54:30.286
I never play a losing game!

54:30.286 --> 54:32.427
I'll retrieve the money
as well as the interest.

54:32.427 --> 54:35.927
So don't worry and just calm down!

54:38.666 --> 54:41.867
Tell me. Do you have a plan
or something?

54:41.867 --> 54:43.166
Come on, Dad.

54:43.967 --> 54:45.867
Don't you know him?

54:46.206 --> 54:49.407
I doubt he lent the money
without a backup plan.

54:49.606 --> 54:50.777
Right, Moo Hak?

54:56.476 --> 54:57.677
And...

54:57.947 --> 55:00.587
you shouldn't be too afraid
to spend money,

55:00.587 --> 55:02.587
or you'll never become rich.

55:03.117 --> 55:04.286
Two million dollars!

55:06.056 --> 55:08.657
Why are you still so afraid?

55:08.856 --> 55:10.356
It's not that much.

55:30.076 --> 55:31.076
Sir...

55:33.447 --> 55:34.447
Are you okay?

55:38.226 --> 55:40.087
I will be, won't I?

55:42.626 --> 55:46.626
You see, this happened
out of the blue.

55:46.626 --> 55:49.197
So even the bank doesn't know
what to do.

55:50.936 --> 55:52.706
He must have family members.

55:53.036 --> 55:54.737
His wife passed away
more than two decades ago.

55:54.737 --> 55:56.177
He has one daughter,

55:56.177 --> 55:58.177
and she's quite
the outstanding type.

56:00.277 --> 56:01.447
I knew it.

56:03.416 --> 56:06.186
Tell me. Why is she so outstanding?

56:06.717 --> 56:07.817
After graduating
from Seoul National University,

56:07.817 --> 56:09.856
she got her master's and doctorate
at the University of Tokyo.

56:09.856 --> 56:11.157
She was the youngest student
to achieve this...

56:11.157 --> 56:12.487
and received the highest score
on her thesis.

56:12.487 --> 56:15.097
She's the first Korean to be scouted
to a European gallery,

56:15.097 --> 56:17.126
and she's working there
as the chief researcher.

56:17.527 --> 56:18.567
So?

56:20.126 --> 56:23.137
You may have no knowledge
in this field,

56:23.137 --> 56:25.666
but these are some greatly
commendable achievements.

56:26.067 --> 56:27.507
If I were to compare it to pork,

56:27.507 --> 56:30.407
it's the best cut...

56:30.936 --> 56:32.677
from an Iberian pig.

56:33.706 --> 56:34.947
What a load of garbage.

56:35.416 --> 56:36.576
So simply put,

56:36.576 --> 56:38.617
she's an incompetent, spoiled daughter...

56:38.617 --> 56:41.516
whose parents paid for all her tuition.

56:42.217 --> 56:43.686
Is that what she is?

56:46.887 --> 56:47.887
This won't do.

56:48.527 --> 56:50.197
There's a long waiting list.

56:50.197 --> 56:53.967
If I don't do anything,
I'll end up losing all that money.

56:54.197 --> 56:55.266
What are you going to do?

56:57.567 --> 56:58.567
Yes.

56:59.606 --> 57:00.606
Perhaps,

57:01.266 --> 57:03.007
this might work...

57:03.206 --> 57:05.206
since she's a naive, studious girl.

57:07.047 --> 57:08.047
Impossible.

57:08.547 --> 57:10.576
Or can you offer a different idea?

57:11.617 --> 57:12.686
No, sir.

58:23.987 --> 58:26.856
(Cheongsong Museum of Art)

58:36.297 --> 58:37.837
I have the car ready
and everyone is on standby...

58:37.837 --> 58:39.337
just like you asked.

58:40.367 --> 58:43.237
Timing is everything.
We must strike and pull out fast.

58:43.407 --> 58:45.177
After looking at this
from various angles,

58:45.177 --> 58:48.317
I scheduled our operation
to begin at 10 a.m.

58:48.447 --> 58:49.476
Okay.

59:07.367 --> 59:09.337
So what's going to happen
to our gallery?

59:10.637 --> 59:12.237
The economy is bad.

59:12.237 --> 59:13.867
No one is making an offer
to buy the gallery.

59:16.177 --> 59:17.277
It will close down soon, right?

59:17.976 --> 59:19.947
We have a capable heiress.

59:21.347 --> 59:22.817
I heard she has
a successful career abroad.

59:22.817 --> 59:24.916
I doubt that she'll take over
a gallery that's about to go under.

59:25.286 --> 59:27.186
It's better to sell it off
to anyone who offers to buy it...

59:27.587 --> 59:29.186
and live her life in peace.

59:29.487 --> 59:32.427
Then should we look for another job?

59:33.286 --> 59:34.657
Goodness.

59:38.027 --> 59:41.226
Perhaps, Mr. Kim might know
something that we don't.

59:41.226 --> 59:42.597
He was the director's nephew.

59:43.396 --> 59:44.467
I doubt it.

59:45.706 --> 59:48.706
Gosh. I had a job offer
from a gallery in Doha.

59:49.177 --> 59:50.177
I should've taken it.

59:50.177 --> 59:52.876
I trusted the director and stayed.
Look at the mess I am in now.

59:52.876 --> 59:54.576
You guys are unbelievable.

59:55.246 --> 59:57.617
The director was so good to us.

59:59.087 --> 01:00:02.456
If you have a heart,
you shouldn't say such things.

01:00:18.097 --> 01:00:19.536
I apologize
for not introducing myself sooner.

01:00:21.266 --> 01:00:23.576
I would like to thank you
for fulfilling your duties...

01:00:24.677 --> 01:00:27.476
despite the recent tragedy.

01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:32.746
Starting today,

01:00:32.746 --> 01:00:34.447
I would like to follow
in my father's footsteps...

01:00:34.786 --> 01:00:37.356
as a member of the gallery.
I know I will need a lot of help.

01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:40.027
So thank you in advance.

01:00:40.456 --> 01:00:43.626
Then the gallery will stay open?

01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:02.547
You don't need
to worry about the gallery.

01:01:02.547 --> 01:01:04.746
I've been in talks with the bank.

01:01:05.317 --> 01:01:07.646
And things are getting
resolved smoothly.

01:01:07.887 --> 01:01:10.487
We have a problem. Please hurry.

01:01:12.226 --> 01:01:13.887
What is it? What's going on?

01:01:15.996 --> 01:01:17.757
Where's the owner?

01:01:18.226 --> 01:01:19.597
Come on out now.

01:01:20.027 --> 01:01:22.036
Come out now!

01:01:22.367 --> 01:01:25.936
You borrowed my money,
and it's time that you pay it back.

01:01:25.936 --> 01:01:28.737
Did you think I can
just pull money out of a hat?

01:01:28.976 --> 01:01:30.606
I want to see the owner now!

01:01:30.606 --> 01:01:32.777
- Come on out!
- Come on out!

01:01:33.447 --> 01:01:36.777
I'm the Majang-dong Fighter.
You got that?

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:38.817
I won't take a step away
from this gallery...

01:01:38.817 --> 01:01:41.347
until you give back
the two million dollars I lent you.

01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:43.956
Hey, I don't care
if I'm at a gallery or not.

01:01:43.956 --> 01:01:46.587
Before I cover this gallery up
with blood,

01:01:46.587 --> 01:01:49.697
give back my two million dollars!

01:01:49.697 --> 01:01:52.097
- Give it back!
- Give it back!

01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.177
Before I burn these paintings here,

01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:04.876
you'd better pay me back!

01:02:04.876 --> 01:02:06.606
Give me my money!

01:02:06.606 --> 01:02:12.016
- Give him his money!
- Give him his money!

01:02:12.987 --> 01:02:15.456
- Give him his money!
- Give him his money!

01:02:39.847 --> 01:02:41.347
Mr. Jin?

01:02:51.516 --> 01:02:52.626
No, I'm not.

01:03:28.107 --> 01:03:31.817
(Dali and Cocky Prince)

01:03:32.277 --> 01:03:33.618
You and me.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.248
I'm your creditor. You, my debtor.
That's all there is to it.

01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:39.357
Are you following me?

01:03:39.518 --> 01:03:41.688
- Mr. Jin.
- Hey.

01:03:41.688 --> 01:03:43.087
You know Segi Group, right?

01:03:43.157 --> 01:03:44.558
What are you doing?

01:03:44.728 --> 01:03:46.357
There was once a talk about
a possible engagement...

01:03:46.357 --> 01:03:47.458
between her and the heir.

01:03:47.458 --> 01:03:50.398
So he's trying to win her over
with money? How petty.

01:03:50.398 --> 01:03:52.967
I always end up
indebted to you, Mr. Jin.

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:54.368
She's your debtor.

01:03:54.368 --> 01:03:57.438
You are her creditor.
And she, your debtor!

01:03:57.538 --> 01:04:00.478
Do you think I can save the gallery?

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:01.877
No.

01:04:02.348 --> 01:04:04.078
Not without my help, at least.
