WEBVTT

00:15.116 --> 00:17.451
Previously on
Blunt Talk...

00:17.551 --> 00:19.053
I think I'm being followed.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.055
A colleague of mine,
he was on to something

00:21.155 --> 00:23.191
very corrupt here
in LA with the water.
He's dead.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.127
I haven't done anything
wrong lately, have I?

00:26.227 --> 00:29.863
You've yet
to respond to Vivian
and Moby's wedding invitation.

00:30.064 --> 00:31.332
This is all my fault.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.601
Oh, don't beat
yourself up, Walter.

00:33.701 --> 00:36.404
Not everything
is your fault.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.572
How do they do that?

00:38.672 --> 00:41.309
I mean, is there a hole
under the desk and they're
all climbing up a ladder?

00:41.409 --> 00:43.344
Ready, Jim? We have to
go to the hospital now.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.347
Okay. Did I just
swallow mescaline?
Yeah.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.116
Celia, will you marry me?

00:48.216 --> 00:49.583
I love you so much.
I really do.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.220
This is terrible.
Herschel, where's Cornelia?

00:52.320 --> 00:54.021
You know, I heard her
talking on the phone.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.623
She's meeting somebody
at the old depot.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.591
It seemed serious.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.228
This can't be good, Harry.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.548
Harry...!

01:20.648 --> 01:22.616
Sit down and try
to relax, Major.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.252
I'm not a major,
I'm a captain.

01:24.352 --> 01:25.619
And why do I need
to relax?

01:25.719 --> 01:28.322
Sorry, I was referring
to the major, Major.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.524
I mean captain,
Captain.
What?

01:30.624 --> 01:32.560
Who's the major?
He's the major, Captain.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.495
Uh, that's right,
I'm the captain, Major.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.230
Uh, I'm the major,
Captain.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.466
Christ, Harry,
you got me all muddled.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.701
I think you're both drunk.
I smell alcohol.

01:40.801 --> 01:43.237
I take offense to that
statement, Captain.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.605
I am perfectly sober.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.275
Maybe it's witch hazel
you can smell, Captain.

01:47.375 --> 01:48.609
We use it
for dry skin

01:48.709 --> 01:52.513
and, uh, other more
private ailments.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.582
Mr. Blunt.
Yes?

01:54.682 --> 01:57.285
We've located
your missing person.
She's at Cedars-Sinai.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.720
Somebody gave her
a good working over,
but she's conscious.

02:01.389 --> 02:04.392
Dr. Shapiro to Cardiac...

02:09.563 --> 02:11.232
I'll wait here, sir.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.434
Thank you, Harry.

02:26.447 --> 02:28.616
Oh, oh, oh!

02:30.818 --> 02:33.287
Walter.
Poor dear.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.656
I can't believe
this has happened.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.791
Are you in pain?

02:37.891 --> 02:40.494
Not too bad.
Good drugs.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.596
Almost makes it worth it.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.365
But how did you find me?

02:44.465 --> 02:46.133
I went to the police.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.636
Oh, Walter,
I'm so sorry
I worried you.

02:48.736 --> 02:51.138
If you had waited

02:51.239 --> 02:53.407
till the end of the broadcast,
I would have come with you.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
I could have protected you.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.311
But I was set up.

02:57.411 --> 03:01.349
Somebody is making a lot
of money off of this drought.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.050
And they don't want
people to know.

03:03.251 --> 03:05.152
Here we go.
Oh!

03:05.253 --> 03:08.622
Tony.
Walter, this is Tony.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.524
Tony, Walter.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.793
Hello.
Walter Blunt.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.296
I used to read
your column years ago.

03:15.396 --> 03:18.332
Oh.
Why did you use so many
exclamation marks?

03:18.432 --> 03:20.468
Tony, could you
give us a minute?

03:20.568 --> 03:23.537
Okay.
There's a clown
in the hallway.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.274
I'll pick his brain
for a good restaurant.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.441
...tech to Radiology.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.443
Imaging tech
to Radiology.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.646
So, um, who's Tony?

03:32.746 --> 03:35.616
We've been seeing each other
for the last six months.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.818
He flew here
to surprise me.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.554
I wanted to say
something sooner.

03:40.654 --> 03:43.724
It was just such
a shock to see you.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.294
Just tell me
how I can help you.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.662
There's nothing for you
to do, Walter.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.798
This is a fight
I can't win.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.603
Tomorrow, I'm going
back to England.

03:57.571 --> 04:01.342
I'm so sorry our timing
has never been right.

04:12.986 --> 04:17.358
Jesus Christ,
Jim's proposal's been reposted
half a million times.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.327
Where are all
the Shelly Tinkle GIFs?

04:19.393 --> 04:22.229
I know.
And I can't believe we
didn't think of Jimelia.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.197
I guess we've been
distracted by work.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.700
Jimelia.
Jim-elia.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.902
Jim-elia.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.339
It-- I mean, it's even
better than Brangelina.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.342
Or Kimye.
Or, uh-- or Billary.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.443
Or Sacher-Masoch.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.411
Who's Sacher-Masoch?

04:37.511 --> 04:39.347
Oh, I just threw
that in there.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.881
He invented masochism
in the 19th century

04:40.981 --> 04:43.584
and was a friend
to the Jews.
Oh.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.355
But do you think, uh, maybe
Celia will change her mind
and marry Jim?

04:47.388 --> 04:50.824
Oh, I hope not.
I'd still like to get
in her pants just once.

04:50.924 --> 04:54.395
What is it about her
that makes you so mad
with desire?

04:54.495 --> 04:56.430
I think
it's her long legs.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.733
She's like a tree
I want to topple.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.637
But I don't have an axe.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.907
I always want the ones
who don't want me.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.742
I have an axe.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.611
Shut up.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.382
Walter's not gonna
like this, Bob.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.616
Not at all.
No fucking way.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.718
You think I give a shit?

05:17.818 --> 05:20.621
Listen, this Jimelia
thing is huge.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.491
We've never had
a response like this.
Who gets 10,000 emails?

05:23.591 --> 05:27.294
Walter won't put them on-air
to discuss a private matter.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.830
He'll say Blunt Talk
is not a telenovela.

05:29.930 --> 05:34.502
Rosalie, lonely hearts
all across this country
are going nuts.

05:34.602 --> 05:38.572
It is a romantic story.
People want to know why
Celia won't marry him.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.641
You want to know, right?
Oh, yes, Mr. Bob.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.710
But Walter
won't have it!

05:42.810 --> 05:44.878
All I want
is a follow-up segment.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.880
They let our viewers know
that they are okay.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.450
Or not, which would
be even better, right?

05:49.550 --> 05:53.454
I-- I think it's huge.
I love it. I love it.
Mammy!

05:53.554 --> 05:56.890
Did you know Al Jolson,
aside from being one of the
greatest singers of his time,

05:56.990 --> 05:58.726
was also a huge
civil rights activist?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.629
No, I didn't
know that, Bob.
I like to sing.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.464
I love to sing.
I actually could
have been a star.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.566
I went to
the same high school
as Lenny Kravitz.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.037
You know, we should do
a bio piece on Al Jolson.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.511
If Walter gives you
a hard time about Jimelia
being on the air,

06:17.611 --> 06:19.880
you bring him to me
after my facial.

06:22.516 --> 06:24.985
Major,
anything I can do?

06:25.085 --> 06:26.820
Nothing, Harry.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.822
Those bastards.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.824
But she doesn't
want my help.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.059
She wants
nothing from me.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.761
I'm sorry, sir.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.596
And I know
that I am ridiculous,

06:35.696 --> 06:38.466
but I am heartbroken
again.

06:38.532 --> 06:41.001
And it's all
just projection, Harry.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.837
Most love is, sir.
What did Proust say?

06:43.937 --> 06:46.740
It is our imagination
that is responsible

06:46.840 --> 06:48.509
for love,
not the other person.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.944
I don't give a shit
about Proust, Harry.

06:51.044 --> 06:55.916
What pains me
is that she's with that
ass with the flowing hair.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.119
You have
a beautiful head, sir.
Like an artillery shell.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.855
So there's no need
to compare yourself
unfavorably

07:01.955 --> 07:03.056
to that dickhead
in the hospital.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.959
It's not about hair, Harry.

07:06.059 --> 07:09.497
I was never, ever
good enough for her.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.871
Walter, what's up?
It's early.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.541
I-- I want to come
and see you, Vivian.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.875
It's really important.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.611
What's wrong?

07:23.711 --> 07:24.878
You're not coming
to the wedding?

07:24.978 --> 07:28.081
Oh, Moby will be
so disappointed.

07:28.181 --> 07:31.118
He loves you.
It's not about Moby.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.521
Hey, Walter.
It's Moby.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.722
What's not about Moby?

07:36.123 --> 07:39.560
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.128
Jim, please,
it's just a break.

07:41.228 --> 07:44.031
I need some time to think.
I need to breathe.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.700
You can think and you can
breathe and still be with me.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.637
I'm really sorry
I asked you to marry me

07:49.737 --> 07:52.139
while having
a hallucinogenic
experience, okay?

07:52.239 --> 07:54.608
I really am.
I'm sorry.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.109
It's not just that, Jim.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.846
I'm not good
at relationships.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.848
I feel like
I get erased.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.249
I only think
about you.

08:02.349 --> 08:04.585
Well, thinking
about me is good.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.555
- No, it's-- it's not.
- It's good.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.758
But if I hadn't asked you
to marry me, you wouldn't
be doing this.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.726
It may have pushed me
over the edge, yes.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.095
Over the edge?

08:15.195 --> 08:18.031
I hate myself.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.967
Jim, it's just
a break.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.670
Just some time for us
to, you know, think.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.572
This break might
give us perspective.

08:24.638 --> 08:27.007
It's just a break--
Stop saying "break."

08:27.107 --> 08:30.143
A break is just the first
step in breakup.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.079
Break-up.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.182
Break-up.
This is a breakup.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.651
Jim, please.
Let's be positive.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.887
Let's be grateful
that your-- your polyp
isn't cancerous.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.122
I don't care about
my stupid polyp.

08:42.222 --> 08:46.093
This has happened
to me before.

08:46.193 --> 08:49.597
It starts with a break,
then it's breakup.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.999
It's a break-up.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.167
A break-up.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.937
This is a break-up.
Jim!

08:59.106 --> 09:02.042
When will this...

09:02.142 --> 09:05.646
separation be over?

09:05.746 --> 09:07.715
I don't know.
You have to be patient.

09:07.815 --> 09:11.184
I really need you
to do this if you want
to hold on to us.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.268
Is it over yet?
Jim.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.308
Now?
Don't be silly.

09:39.179 --> 09:43.817
Now?
You know the break restarts
every time you ask that.

09:46.086 --> 09:49.289
I don't understand.
We covered this in
couples counseling

09:49.389 --> 09:51.058
for three years
and two months.

09:51.158 --> 09:55.195
Yeah, but I-- I never really
grasped what went wrong--

09:55.295 --> 09:58.131
why it didn't
work out.

09:58.231 --> 10:02.102
What in me
was lacking?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.104
Nothing.
Nothing.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.841
Uh, well, maybe it was
the late nights,

10:07.941 --> 10:10.778
the drinking,
your bathroom issues,
Harry.

10:10.878 --> 10:14.214
But deep down inside
I just knew I wasn't
the one for you.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.250
Daddy!
Hey, Bertie.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.319
Give us a hug.
Ah!

10:19.419 --> 10:22.255
Hey, why are you
wearing a yarmulke?

10:22.355 --> 10:25.358
Moby wants everyone
at the wedding to wear
a yarmulke.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.828
Hey, but Moby's
not a Jewish name.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.097
Ready or not,
here I come!

10:30.197 --> 10:33.166
Bertie! Walter, hi.
Hi, Moby.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.202
It's so good
to see you.
Yeah.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.104
Family.
No.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.406
Your show last night
was amazing.

10:39.506 --> 10:42.910
Thank you.
But are those two actually
gonna get married?

10:43.010 --> 10:44.978
I don't know
what's happening
with Jim and Celia.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.080
But, Moby,
why are you
getting everyone

10:47.180 --> 10:48.949
to wear yarmulkes
at your wedding?

10:49.049 --> 10:51.184
So I have this idea
that all of us

10:51.284 --> 10:53.353
are gonna wear
these shiny yarmulkes

10:53.453 --> 10:55.823
and there's gonna be
an aerial drone

10:55.923 --> 10:59.092
circling over the wedding
and with our yarmulkes

10:59.192 --> 11:00.794
we're gonna spell out

11:00.894 --> 11:04.131
"Moby loves Vivian."

11:04.231 --> 11:05.733
Oh.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.570
Well, I'm sorry to add
to your miseries, Walter,

11:10.738 --> 11:13.440
but I do have three
pieces of bad news.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.375
In what order
do you want them?

11:15.475 --> 11:18.111
Oh, start
with the least painful
and work your way up.

11:18.211 --> 11:22.182
Okay, one-- the jail
is on lockdown

11:22.282 --> 11:24.051
with a lice
outbreak.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.586
We have to reschedule
Duncan Adler.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.889
Fine, bump him.
We've done it before.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.824
That wasn't too bad.

11:30.924 --> 11:33.927
Two-- we heard
from the lawyer.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.931
Blunt Cock may be
harder than we think.
Oh, shit.

11:38.031 --> 11:42.135
Oh, I think we just may have
to swallow this one,
legally speaking.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.304
We have a meeting with
the lawyers next week.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.239
Coffee, Major?
Oh, yes, Harry.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.641
And three--

11:48.776 --> 11:51.444
Gardner wants
Jim and Celia
on air tonight

11:51.544 --> 11:54.214
to discuss last night's
marriage proposal.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.017
What?
Did you see this?

11:57.117 --> 11:59.452
Jimelia is on
the front page of Reddit.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.055
What the hell
is Jimelia?

12:02.155 --> 12:04.124
It's Jim and Celia's
power couple name.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.459
Although Celia has already
asked for a separation.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.695
The Today Show,
Good Morning America,

12:08.796 --> 12:11.131
they all had a good laugh
about it this morning.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.667
But we were trying
to raise consciousness
about colon cancer.

12:14.802 --> 12:17.971
Thank you, Harry.
I'm afraid it's been
overshadowed, Walter.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.673
And this is because
Jim went berserk.
Where is he?

12:20.808 --> 12:22.442
He went to run an errand
at the Dollar Shop.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.912
And Celia?
She's in the ladies'
room crying.

12:25.012 --> 12:28.115
And Shelly's consoling her,
if we can trust her motives,

12:28.215 --> 12:30.483
which I think we can.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.385
I think I've finished
crying.
Okay.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.055
Poor Jim.

12:35.155 --> 12:38.926
I once broke up
with someone and he killed
himself three years later.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.294
Oh, I-- I doubt
there was a connection.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.997
Wait, wait, wait.
Some more still needs
to come out.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.967
Celia.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.269
Please,
it's gonna be okay.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.404
I feel terrible
for hurting him.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.941
I'm an awful person.
Just awful.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.977
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not awful.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.179
Jim's gonna be all right.
He'll survive.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.314
But he's so fragile.
So are you.

13:01.414 --> 13:04.284
Listen...

13:04.384 --> 13:07.220
if I do something
funny right now,
will you stop crying?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.321
Like what?

13:11.224 --> 13:13.693
Guess who I am.

13:29.176 --> 13:32.045
Did you figure it out?
It's so easy.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.413
I've got no idea.
Get off the floor.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.048
You're covered
in micro-feces.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.117
Can't believe
you didn't get it.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.352
Isadora Duncan.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.088
Her scarf got caught
in the wheel of a car

13:41.188 --> 13:42.455
in the south of France
and she broke her neck.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.594
Okay, sorry, sorry.
Okay, look. Look.

13:47.694 --> 13:50.763
Jim's gonna
be all right.
I know it.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.000
He is a lot stronger
than we give him credit for.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.026
Bob, I cannot stress
strongly enough

14:19.126 --> 14:22.295
how much I do not
want to do this.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.465
You know, I should
be in front of the camera.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.201
My mother tells me
when I walk into a room,

14:28.301 --> 14:30.203
people take notice,
they always have.

14:30.303 --> 14:34.574
Bob, please, why
is this Jimelia nonsense
so important to you?

14:34.674 --> 14:37.644
Because our audience
wants to know and it's
a good story.

14:37.744 --> 14:41.414
But I don't think Jim
and Celia's love life
is newsworthy.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.383
I don't think
anyone's is.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.452
A private heartbreak

14:45.552 --> 14:47.454
should remain that--
private.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.122
Blunt Talk is not a--

14:49.222 --> 14:50.857
Telenovela.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.060
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

14:53.160 --> 14:54.294
I know everything.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.329
Oh, Bob, please.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.499
Oh, you know who will have
Jim and Celia on air?

14:59.599 --> 15:01.868
Don Lemon.

15:01.969 --> 15:04.972
He would not.
Yeah, he called
earlier today.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.440
He wants to do a satellite
interview with our Jimelia.

15:07.540 --> 15:10.243
What?
So if you won't have 'em on,
I'll give them to Don.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.812
Don and I did a cappella
back at Emory.

15:19.186 --> 15:20.553
Fuck!

15:24.257 --> 15:25.725
Bob won, Walter lost.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.860
Jim and Celia are doing
a two-minute segment.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.997
Well, you were never
gonna win anyway.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.598
He was only
indulging you.

15:31.698 --> 15:36.469
Walter,
your therapist and his
pussy are here again.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.641
Do you think she put
special extra emphasis

15:41.741 --> 15:43.876
on pussy
just to antagonize me?

15:44.011 --> 15:47.447
I do. It's good to have
another bitch in the office.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.682
Besides you.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.783
No!

16:29.322 --> 16:32.359
Do you hear mewling
coming from Jim's office?

16:32.459 --> 16:36.729
I do, but I am using Al-Anon.
Detach with disinterest.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.498
I think
it's detach with love.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.900
I went to Al-Anon because
of my college roommate.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.436
He drank beer
every weekend.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.905
Whatever.
I'm detaching.
I have work to do.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.508
Hey, um, I was thinking.

16:48.608 --> 16:52.579
Uh, if we were a power couple,
our name could be Shartin.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.747
Oh, Shartin?
Yeah.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.583
A shit you thought
was a fart.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.518
Uh...
Cool.

16:58.618 --> 16:59.986
You're right.
That doesn't work.

17:00.087 --> 17:03.090
Um, uh,
what about, uh,
Martinelly?

17:03.156 --> 17:06.093
You know, that way, we'd have
our own apple juice.

17:06.159 --> 17:09.329
Uh, I found one in the fridge.
Do you wanna share it?

17:09.429 --> 17:12.932
No, Martin, I don't
want apple juice.

17:13.100 --> 17:15.535
I'm not a baby.
Get back to work.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.539
Jim and Celia
are useless morons today
and Walter needs us.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.374
I have so many regrets.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.910
My first wife,
my third wife,

17:24.111 --> 17:26.479
my second wife,

17:26.579 --> 17:29.682
Cornelia, Vivian.

17:29.782 --> 17:32.219
I've loved too much

17:32.319 --> 17:33.820
or I've loved
too little.

17:33.920 --> 17:38.658
Troubled people love
in a troubled way, Walter.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.694
Perhaps, then,
this is a time
to help others.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.863
You know, it's often
at our own nadir

17:44.131 --> 17:46.466
we can be
our most useful.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.536
I was thinking,
perhaps if you--

17:53.140 --> 17:56.309
Beth? Doctor?

17:56.409 --> 17:59.712
I will check on you
every hour, Dr. Mendelson.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.482
Thank you, Walter.
I won't bill you
for the full session.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.317
Oh.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.353
I hope
he'll be all right.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.755
Poor Beth.

18:08.855 --> 18:12.159
First Dr. Weiss,
now Dr. Mendelson.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.461
You're killing off
all your Jewish shrinks.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.530
Their being Jewish,
Rosalie, has nothing
to do with it.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.732
Help!

18:19.832 --> 18:21.434
I think
it's Jim, Major.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.703
Help!

18:23.803 --> 18:26.406
Help. Help.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.176
Jim. Jim.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.710
Walter, what are you
doing here?

18:30.810 --> 18:32.479
You were crying
for help.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.648
I was?
Oh, my God,
he's hoarding again.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.351
Harry, Martin,
help me.

18:38.451 --> 18:39.886
Come on, Jim.
Sit up.

18:39.986 --> 18:43.456
There we go.
Harry, commanding officer.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.194
Here.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.398
Jim, you all right?
Oh, no, no, no.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.832
Don't look at me.
I'm ugly.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.467
Rosalie, get her
out of here.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.237
All of you.
I'm so sorry, Jim.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.210
What's going on, Jim?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.747
Celia broke up
with me

19:07.847 --> 19:10.217
'cause I'm perverted
and I'm ugly.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.785
You're not perverted
and ugly.

19:12.885 --> 19:16.489
Anyway, I was under
the impression this
was just a break.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.625
That's what
they all say, Walter.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.960
It starts with a break,
then it's break-up.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.929
Break-up.
Break-up.

19:23.029 --> 19:25.064
It's a breakup.
Uh, stop it, Jim.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.866
I'm sorry.

19:26.966 --> 19:31.070
I know you're in pain.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.506
And I also understand

19:33.606 --> 19:36.643
the wretched sting
of rejection.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.446
But we have to accept

19:39.546 --> 19:42.882
we cannot control
another person's heart.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.252
We can't?
No.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.254
And everything's
gonna be all right.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.056
You're gonna
be all right.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.725
I am?
Mm-hmm.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.496
Will I get
Celia back?

19:56.596 --> 19:59.466
Uh, that
I can't promise.

19:59.566 --> 20:02.769
Sometimes...

20:02.869 --> 20:05.505
we lose people.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.108
The past 24 hours has been
an emotional roller coaster

20:09.208 --> 20:11.911
and we're both very touched
by the outpouring of concern

20:12.011 --> 20:13.780
after last night's
broadcast.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.983
But it was
premature of me to ask
Celia to marry me.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.686
We've only been dating
for three months.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.955
So we're going
to take a little break
to figure things out.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.157
But let's not forget
why this happened.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.627
If you're over 50,
you should get
a colonoscopy.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.897
It could save your life.
Or break your heart.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.701
We'll-- we'll send it
over to Walter.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.303
Thank you, Celia.
Thank you, Jim.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.339
I applaud your courage
and your honesty.

20:39.439 --> 20:43.376
Now, let's get back
to the news.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.946
They shouldn't
be alone tonight.

20:47.046 --> 20:50.850
I agree.
I'll take Jim,
you take Celia.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.953
At least Martin
and Shelly are stable.

20:54.053 --> 20:57.590
Yeah, my beautiful
Martin.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.359
Hmm.

20:59.459 --> 21:01.027
What about you,
Walter?

21:01.328 --> 21:04.331
Stable?
No!

21:04.397 --> 21:07.767
Not stable.
Not at all.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.803
I'm unglued.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.940
What's Harry say?

21:14.040 --> 21:15.742
Oh, Harry.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.710
He's off
in Sylvialand.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.214
Oh, I'm so
frustrated, Rosalie.

21:22.349 --> 21:26.353
Tonight's broadcast
was humiliating.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.921
And I do nothing
while Cornelia

21:29.021 --> 21:31.691
is terrorized
and chased out of LA.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.694
So do something.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.863
Show this woman
you love her,

21:36.963 --> 21:39.366
but expect nothing
in return.

21:39.432 --> 21:43.202
Hmm.
Can we flip over now?

21:43.370 --> 21:47.073
With Teddy away,
I need some affection.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.741
Yes, Rosalie.

21:53.913 --> 21:57.484
Oh, yes.

21:58.918 --> 22:01.053
"To put it concisely,

22:01.153 --> 22:03.923
we suffer
when we resist the noble

22:04.023 --> 22:07.894
and irrefutable truth
of impermanence and death."

22:09.596 --> 22:11.598
Well, I think
we'll stop there.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.967
Thanks, Harry.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.836
And thank--
thank you guys
for tucking me in.

22:16.936 --> 22:21.408
I was hoping Walter would,
but I guess he's too busy.

22:21.474 --> 22:23.042
I'm sure you'll see him
in the morning, Jim.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.977
He cares about you
very much.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.747
That's right, Jim.
And if you have
night terrors,

22:27.847 --> 22:30.817
just scream
and we will come running.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.585
What?

22:34.220 --> 22:38.090
Now, be a good lad
and get some rest.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.893
Oh, I'm not
quite ready to close
my eyes now, Harry.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.995
Time to sleep, Jim.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.965
Yeah, but, Harry,
I just--

22:46.065 --> 22:48.468
I wouldn't fight him, Jim.
He's very strict
about bedtime.

22:48.568 --> 22:50.269
It's true.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.539
Oh!
Okay, okay.

22:52.639 --> 22:55.542
Now, there's a good lad.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.482
Herschel...!

23:47.527 --> 23:50.396
It's okay.
You're drunk.
I know I am.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.132
We're fantastic
together.

23:55.602 --> 23:58.638
You know that lyric
"He's your fella
and you love him"?

24:00.139 --> 24:03.042
I hope Jim knows
I am thinking of him.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.513
I'm sure he does.

24:06.613 --> 24:10.349
He's probably hearing you
singing in his dreams.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.719
Now, come on,
let's try again.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.186
I want to take
this on.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.922
I want to find those men
who murdered your friend

24:50.022 --> 24:52.391
and who assaulted you.

24:52.559 --> 24:54.927
Walter, please,
let it go.

24:55.027 --> 24:56.929
I can't let it go,
Cornelia.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.666
I have to do this
for you and for me.

24:59.766 --> 25:01.968
You understand?

25:02.068 --> 25:05.605
I still need to be
a journalist.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.040
All right, Walter.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.948
A memento?

25:16.048 --> 25:17.483
It's a jump drive.

25:17.584 --> 25:20.219
It has all
my colleague's files.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.622
But please
be careful.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.958
This drought is deadly
in more ways than one.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.360
Thank you.

25:56.623 --> 25:57.824
Lobby.
