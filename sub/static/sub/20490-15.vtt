WEBVTT

00:01.521 --> 00:05.023
===MUTANT X Under The Cloak Of War / s02.ep15===

00:04.504 --> 00:06.506
MAN, I HATE THESE THINGS.

00:06.506 --> 00:09.107
A BUNCH OF RICH PEOPLE STANDING
AROUND CONGRATULATING EACH

00:09.108 --> 00:11.010
OTHER ON HOW MUCH BETTER
THEY ARE THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

00:11.010 --> 00:14.412
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO
SEE THE TAILOR LEFT ROOM FOR
THE CHIP ON YOUR SHOULDER.

00:14.412 --> 00:16.215
MAN, YOU DON'T LIKE THESE
THINGS ANY MORE THAN I DO.

00:16.215 --> 00:19.818
NO, I DON'T. BUT
IT'S WHERE I CAME FROM.

00:19.818 --> 00:21.820
THE TRICK, YOU SEE,
IS THAT NOBODY DOES.

00:22.221 --> 00:24.623
YOU JUST GOT TO BE COOL
ENOUGH NOT TO LET IT SHOW.

00:24.623 --> 00:25.225
YEAH, WHATEVER.

00:27.625 --> 00:30.629
WELL, AT LEAST ADAM
SEEMS TO BE ENJOYING HIMSELF.

00:30.629 --> 00:33.233
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE HIM OUT.

00:36.233 --> 00:38.237
OH. WOW.

00:38.637 --> 00:39.639
YOU GUYS LOOK AMAZING.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.842
YEAH, BUT I
DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO
CLIMB A WALL IN THIS THING.

00:43.243 --> 00:44.844
SO...?

00:49.249 --> 00:50.050
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SAY ANYTHING?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.452
YOU LOOK GOOD.

00:52.452 --> 00:56.856
YOU LOOK REALLY GOOD.

00:56.856 --> 01:01.261
REGULATION OF
ADVANCED GENETIC FUNDING IS
IN EVERYBODY'S INTERESTS.

01:01.661 --> 01:05.265
FINALLY, SOMEONE
WHO TELLS THE TRUTH.

01:05.665 --> 01:08.468
ALL THE OTHERS ARE WORRIED
ABOUT IS THEIR PRECIOUS FUNDING.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.870
I'D LIKE TO THINK SO.
THANK YOU.

01:11.271 --> 01:12.472
I'M SORRY, I DON'T KNOW YOU.

01:12.472 --> 01:13.673
I'M ADAM KANE.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.275
SERENA.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.476
SERENA...?

01:16.876 --> 01:18.878
JUST SERENA.

01:18.878 --> 01:21.281
I'M SORRY, SO, ARE
YOU INTERESTED IN GENETICS?

01:21.281 --> 01:24.084
I WORK IN THE GENE
SEQUENCING LAB AT BERKELEY.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.285
REALLY?

01:25.285 --> 01:28.488
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE
YOUR AVERAGE SCIENTIST.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.490
WELL, NOW YOU'RE
BEING JUDGMENTAL.

01:30.490 --> 01:32.892
I'D EXPECTED MORE FROM YOU.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.295
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

01:35.295 --> 01:38.098
I'LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY
FOR YOU TO MAKE IT UP TO ME.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.701
MAYBE I COULD BUY YOU A DRINK.

01:43.703 --> 01:48.108
WELL... THERE'S ANOTHER
SIDE OF ADAM WE'RE SEEING.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.110
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO
BET HE TAKES HER HOME TONIGHT?

01:50.110 --> 01:50.910
NO WAY.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.512
AW, COME ON, ADAM'S A MAN.

01:52.512 --> 01:55.315
AND SHE IS...
DEFINITELY A WOMAN.

01:55.315 --> 02:01.321
DOUBLE OR NOTHING THEY
SHARE BREAKFAST IN THE MORNING.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.325
SO TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF.

02:05.725 --> 02:06.926
MYSELF...

02:06.926 --> 02:08.928
I TOLD YOU WHERE I WORK.

02:08.928 --> 02:10.530
I KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING MORE PERSONAL,

02:10.930 --> 02:12.132
LIKE YOUR LAST NAME.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.333
SERENA WHAT?

02:13.733 --> 02:15.335
AHH, MY LAST NAME.

02:15.335 --> 02:17.737
WELL, IT'S A SECRET.

02:17.737 --> 02:19.739
REALLY? WELL, I'M
GOOD AT KEEPING SECRETS.

02:19.739 --> 02:21.341
REALLY?
YEAH.

02:21.341 --> 02:25.745
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.349
REALLY?

02:29.349 --> 02:30.550
UH HUH.

02:30.550 --> 02:31.751
WELL, THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL NAME.

02:31.751 --> 02:32.952
NOW, THERE'S ONLY ONE THING.

02:33.353 --> 02:34.154
UH HUH?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.355
NOW THAT YOU KNOW...

02:35.355 --> 02:36.556
UH HUH.

02:36.956 --> 02:38.958
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO KILL YOU.

02:40.000 --> 02:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:56.576 --> 02:58.978
WHO SENT YOU?

02:58.978 --> 03:00.580
WHO SENT YOU?!

03:04.184 --> 03:06.586
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.020
I AM ADAM KANE.

03:41.421 --> 03:43.423
I WAS A PIONEER
OF GENETIC RESEARCH,

03:43.423 --> 03:46.626
MANIPULATING DNA
TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.829
BUT IN MANY THEIR
GENES UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED.

03:49.829 --> 03:54.234
THEY DEVELOPED
SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.863
TOGETHER WITH FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL

04:23.863 --> 04:26.666
I FIGHT TO PROTECT A WORLD
THAT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WE EXIST.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.072
WE ARE... MUTANT X.

04:41.514 --> 04:43.116
ADAM, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

04:43.516 --> 04:44.717
I WISH I KNEW.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.719
COME ON, YOU MUST HAVE SOME IDEA
WHY SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL YOU.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.321
WELL, I...

04:48.321 --> 04:50.323
I'M ASSUMING
IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH
MY SPEECH AT THE CONFERENCE.

04:50.323 --> 04:51.924
WELL, ADAM, IT
COULD BE ANY ONE OF A NUMBER
OF PEOPLE WE'VE TAKEN DOWN.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.926
I MEAN, I CAN THINK OF A FEW WHO
WOULDN'T MIND A LITTLE PAYBACK.

04:53.926 --> 04:55.128
YEAH, WELL, WHOEVER IT IS,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.930
THEY'VE GONE TO
THE BEST TO TRY TO DO IT.

04:58.331 --> 05:01.134
THE WOMAN WHO TRIED TO
KILL ME HAD A TATTOO OF A BLUE

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
LIGHTNING BOLT ON HER WRIST.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.938
NOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE

05:05.938 --> 05:08.341
SO-CALLED BLUE BOLT WAS A MYTH.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.144
BUT AFTER THE RESEARCH
THAT I'VE DONE TODAY?

05:11.144 --> 05:13.546
THEY'RE REAL.

05:13.546 --> 05:15.548
YOU KNOW, I MIGHT NOT BE UP
ON MY CRIME LORE, BUT WHAT DOES

05:15.548 --> 05:17.550
A BIT OF BODY ART HAVE TO
DO WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO

05:17.550 --> 05:19.152
KILL YOU, ADAM?

05:19.152 --> 05:20.753
IN THE WORLD
OF COVERT OPERATIONS,

05:20.753 --> 05:23.556
BLUE BOLT WERE RUMOURED TO
BE AN ELITE ASSASSINATION RING.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.558
YEAH, WELL, THAT WOMAN
THAT TRIED TO KILL YOU TODAY WAS

05:25.558 --> 05:27.560
DEFINITELY MORE THAN A RUMOUR.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.162
I NOTICED.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.763
AND MY SOURCES ALSO
CAME THROUGH WITH SOME PRETTY

05:30.763 --> 05:32.365
FRIGHTENING CONFIRMATION.

05:32.765 --> 05:35.968
BLUE BOLT IS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE TRAINING AND
WEAPONRY SECOND TO NONE.

05:35.968 --> 05:40.373
THEY CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO GET
TO ANYBODY, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE.

05:40.373 --> 05:42.375
LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS, ADAM,

05:42.375 --> 05:44.777
BUT I
THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER
SPEAKING AT THE CONFERENCE.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.779
NO, I'VE BEEN HIDING
OUT IN SANCTUARY LONG ENOUGH.

05:46.779 --> 05:48.381
THESE PEOPLE ARE
NOT GOING TO SCARE ME AWAY.

05:48.781 --> 05:49.982
ADAM, SHE TRIED TO KILL YOU.

05:49.982 --> 05:51.584
THESE PEOPLE MEAN BUSINESS.

05:51.584 --> 05:52.785
WE HAVE TO TAKE A CHANCE.

05:52.785 --> 05:54.387
THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE HERE.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.988
WELL, IF YOU'RE SET ON
SPEAKING AT THAT CONFERENCE,

05:56.389 --> 05:58.391
THEN WHAT WE HAVE TO
DO IS ELIMINATE THAT THREAT.

05:58.391 --> 05:59.992
NO, NO, NO. WE
NEED TO INFILTRATE THEM.

05:59.992 --> 06:02.395
KEEP THEM AWAY FROM ADAM
UNTIL AFTER THE CONFERENCE.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.397
AND FIND OUT
WHO ORDERED THE HIT.

06:04.397 --> 06:05.998
RIGHT. SO WHO GOES IN?

06:06.399 --> 06:08.000
I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS.

06:08.000 --> 06:13.206
TO RUN WITH THE HUNTERS,
WE NEED OUR OWN PREDATOR...

06:26.419 --> 06:29.222
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
SHE WAS YOUR BEST OPERATIVE.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.823
SHE WAS.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.024
HE MUST'VE HAD HELP.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.226
HE COULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN HER OUT ALONE.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.827
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR EXCUSES.

06:34.827 --> 06:36.829
FOR WHAT I'M PAYING YOU
I EXPECT NOTHING BUT RESULTS.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.431
THAT IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'LL RECEIVE.

06:38.831 --> 06:39.632
YOU HAVE MY GUARANTEE.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.234
I DON'T WANT GUARANTEES.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.036
I WANT ADAM KANE DEAD BEFORE
HE SPEAKS AT THAT CONFERENCE.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.638
I UNDERESTIMATED
HIM THE FIRST TIME.

06:46.038 --> 06:49.242
NEXT TIME THERE
WILL BE NO MISTAKE.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.246
ADAM.

06:53.646 --> 06:54.847
LOOK, I WANT TO...

06:54.847 --> 06:57.250
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS
WHOLE UNDERCOVER THING, OKAY?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.252
I'M NOT SO SURE
IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.254
YOU MEAN THE IDEA, OR
THE IDEA OF SENDING SHALIMAR IN?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.455
OKAY, NO OFFENSE, SHAL, BUT I...

07:02.455 --> 07:04.457
I'VE HAD WAY MORE EXPERIENCE
IN THE UNDERGROUND.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.058
YOU THINK I CAN'T DO THIS?

07:07.660 --> 07:09.262
NO. YOU SAID YOU THINK YOU
CAN DO THIS BETTER THAN I CAN.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.463
LOOK, OKAY, WAIT.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.465
YOU'RE BOTH GREAT PROFESSIONALS,
BUT SHALIMAR'S AGILITY,

07:12.465 --> 07:14.467
THE SPEED OF HER FIGHTING
SKILLS AND HER PREDATORY NATURE

07:14.467 --> 07:16.469
MAKE HER A NATURAL
FOR THIS ORGANIZATION.

07:16.469 --> 07:18.871
DO WE EVEN KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THESE GUYS?

07:18.871 --> 07:20.873
YEAH, HOW TO CONTACT THEM.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.875
AT A BAR ON THE EAST
SIDE CALLED MOTHER'S MILK.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.877
AND?

07:24.877 --> 07:26.078
THAT'S IT.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.680
NO NAMES, NO CONTACT, NOTHING.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.282
JUST A TIP THAT I GOT, THAT
IF YOU WANT TO FIND BLUE BOLT,

07:29.682 --> 07:31.284
YOU GO TO MOTHER'S MILK.

07:31.684 --> 07:33.286
WELL, COME ON, WELL,
WHAT ABOUT SHALIMAR'S BACKUP?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.487
WE NEED FLOOR PLANS.

07:34.887 --> 07:35.688
WE NEED SCHEMATICS.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.690
WE NEED... WE
NEED A MAP OF THE AREA.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.292
WE NEED
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE
GOING TO POSITION OURSELVES.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.493
BRENNAN, SHE'S GOING IN ALONE.

07:40.493 --> 07:41.694
ONE NEW FACE IS SUSPICIOUS.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.696
FOUR FACES, IT SETS OFF ALARMS.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.298
OKAY?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.899
SHE'S GOING TO BE IN CONSTANT
CONTACT WITH US VIA COMLINK.

07:46.899 --> 07:48.901
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
HER COVERED, DON'T WORRY.

07:48.901 --> 07:50.102
I STILL GOT TO GET
YOU PREPPED, ALL RIGHT?

07:50.503 --> 07:51.304
COME WITH ME.

07:51.704 --> 07:52.905
WE'RE GOING TO TRY
TO MAKE CONTACT TONIGHT.

07:52.905 --> 07:54.106
NO, WAIT.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.708
SHAL. SHAL, LISTEN.

07:55.708 --> 07:56.909
JUST FOR THE RECORD,
I DON'T DOUBT YOUR SKILLS.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.511
YEAH, WELL, YOU
COULD'VE FOOLED ME.

07:58.511 --> 07:59.712
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

07:59.712 --> 08:00.913
THAT'S IT.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.915
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
BRENNAN, NOT MINE.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.116
OKAY, YOU WANT
TO WORRY ABOUT SOMEONE?

08:04.116 --> 08:08.521
WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE OUT ADAM.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.531
WELL, I MADE YOU
UP A FAKE RAP SHEET.

08:18.931 --> 08:20.933
IT'S REGISTERED WITH ALL THE
MAJOR LAW ENFORCEMENT DATABASES.

08:20.933 --> 08:25.338
WELL, MULTIPLE ASSAULTS,
SUSPECTED HOMICIDE...

08:25.338 --> 08:27.340
ATTEMPTED HOMICIDE.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.140
NICE.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.342
EH.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.943
SO YOU OKAY WITH THIS?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.746
WELL, I'M ABOUT TO WALK
INTO A DEN OF RUTHLESS KILLERS.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.947
WHAT'S TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT?

08:34.947 --> 08:36.148
RIGHT.

08:36.549 --> 08:38.150
LET'S GET YOU ON YOUR WAY.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.953
GOOD JOB.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.788
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:15.788 --> 09:17.390
I DON'T KNOW.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.192
LOOKS LIKE SHALIMAR'S
COMLINK JUST WENT DOWN.

09:20.192 --> 09:21.394
WHAT? ARE THEY ON TO HER?

09:21.794 --> 09:23.396
NAH, IT'S TOO SOON.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.798
NO, THEY MUST HAVE SOME KIND
OF ANTI-SURVEILLANCE JAMMING

09:25.798 --> 09:27.800
IN PLACE OR SOMETHING.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.009
MINERAL WATER WITH A TWIST.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.812
DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
A MINERAL WATER ROOM TO YOU?

09:39.812 --> 09:42.214
NOT FOR SOMEBODY WHO
JUST CAME IN HERE TO DRINK.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.416
DON'T TELL ME.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.418
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR COMPANIONSHIP.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.019
I'M LOOKING FOR WORK.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.822
I'VE HEARD THIS MIGHT
BE THE PLACE TO FIND IT.

09:49.822 --> 09:51.424
FROM WHO?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.826
FROM SOMEONE WHO'D PROBABLY
END UP DEAD IF I TOLD YOU.

09:54.226 --> 09:59.031
I THINK YOU HAVE THE WRONG
PLACE HERE, UH, GOLDILOCKS.

09:59.031 --> 10:04.637
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

10:05.037 --> 10:07.039
I BET YOU HAVEN'T.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.442
OH, I HAVE.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.444
BUT BEFORE THEY FIND
YOU IN AN ALLEY SOMEWHERE,

10:11.444 --> 10:15.448
YOU AND ME ARE GOING
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.450
REALLY.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.452
A GOOD TIME?

10:19.452 --> 10:25.858
BECAUSE FOR
ME, A GOOD TIME IS...

10:25.858 --> 10:29.061
DOING STUFF LIKE THIS.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.063
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I ENJOY?

10:31.063 --> 10:33.466
AND WHAT'S REALLY FUN IS THIS!

10:51.884 --> 10:55.488
ANYBODY ELSE
WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN?

11:07.099 --> 11:09.502
THAT WAS GOOD.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.105
WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO
FIGHT LIKE THAT?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.908
HERE AND THERE.

11:15.908 --> 11:19.512
WHERE I GREW UP I
SPENT HALF MY TIME FIGHTING
OFF PUNKS LIKE THAT.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.115
YOU'RE HERE FOR A REASON.

11:23.115 --> 11:29.522
I HEARD THIS WAS A PLACE WHERE
SOMEBODY LIKE ME CAN FIND WORK.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.924
AND WHAT IS SOMEONE LIKE YOU?

11:31.924 --> 11:33.926
SOMEONE WHO DOES
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE,

11:33.926 --> 11:36.729
AND GETS PAID A
LOT OF MONEY FOR DOING IT.

11:36.729 --> 11:39.932
YOU UNDERSTAND?

11:39.932 --> 11:42.735
THE THINGS WEAKER PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE THE STOMACH FOR.

11:42.735 --> 11:44.737
AND YOU'RE SURE YOU DO?

11:45.137 --> 11:47.540
WELL, THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO COULD VOUCH FOR ME.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.743
IF THEY COULD STILL TALK.

11:50.743 --> 11:52.745
THERE MIGHT BE AN OPENING...

11:52.745 --> 11:55.548
IF YOU'RE AS GOOD
AS YOU SAY YOU ARE.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.751
TRY ME.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.161
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.564
LET'S BOTH HOPE YOU'RE UP TO IT.

12:20.940 --> 12:23.743
ADAM, IT'S BEEN AN HOUR SINCE
SHALIMAR'S GONE INTO THAT BAR,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.745
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO LOCATE HER COMLINK SIGNAL.

12:25.745 --> 12:29.348
WELL, IT'S GOING
TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR HER
TO WIN THOSE PEOPLE'S TRUSTS.

12:29.348 --> 12:31.350
YEAH, WELL, WHAT
IF SHE'S IN TROUBLE?

12:31.350 --> 12:32.952
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

12:32.952 --> 12:34.954
I MEAN, YOU WANT TO SEND IN
THE TROOPS, AND CRASH IN THERE?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.155
BLOW THE COVER.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.157
I MEAN, HOW'S THAT
GOING TO HELP THE MISSION?

12:38.157 --> 12:39.759
ADAM, FORGET ABOUT
THE MISSION FOR A SECOND.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.161
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT'S TOO PROUD TO GIVE UP
GOING TO THIS CONFERENCE,

12:42.161 --> 12:43.763
AND THAT'S WHY SHE'S RISKING
HER LIFE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.364
SO WHY DON'T
YOU THINK ABOUT HER?

12:45.364 --> 12:46.966
I AM THINKING ABOUT HER.

12:46.966 --> 12:48.567
MOSTLY THINKING THAT
YOU'RE OVERPROTECTIVE.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.169
NO, NO. I AM CONCERNED.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.571
SHALIMAR IS ONE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL MUTANTS EVER RECORDED.

12:52.972 --> 12:54.173
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES THAT MAKE?

12:54.573 --> 12:55.775
THESE GUYS HAVE GOT WEAPONS.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.777
THEY'VE GOT THINGS THAT WE'VE
NEVER EVEN HEARD OF BEFORE.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.378
BUT SHE'S ALSO
SMART AND SHE'S CAREFUL.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.980
OF COURSE, I WORRY ABOUT HER.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.982
I WORRY ABOUT HER THE WAY
I WORRY ABOUT SENDING ANY OF YOU

13:02.982 --> 13:04.183
INTO ONE OF THESE SITUATIONS.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.185
BUT I GAVE HER A MISSION.

13:06.185 --> 13:07.787
NOW, HOW DO YOU THINK SHE'S
GOING TO FEEL IF WE SEND IN THE

13:08.187 --> 13:09.388
TROOPS AND TELL HER THAT,

13:09.388 --> 13:10.990
NO, WE DIDN'T
TRUST HER TO HANDLE IT.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.591
ADAM, YOU KNOW I'M WORRIED
ABOUT HER FEELINGS, BUT MORE

13:12.992 --> 13:14.994
IMPORTANTLY I'M
WORRIED ABOUT GETTING HER
BACK HERE IN ONE PIECE.

13:14.994 --> 13:16.996
WHAT SHE NEEDS RIGHT
NOW IS NOT YOUR WORRY.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.597
SHE NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT.

13:18.597 --> 13:21.000
THE WAY A PARTNER
SUPPORTS A PARTNER -

13:21.000 --> 13:23.002
BY TRUSTING IN WHAT SHE CAN DO.

13:23.002 --> 13:28.607
AND BY GIVING HER
WHATEVER BACKUP SHE NEEDS.

13:45.424 --> 13:49.028
EASY. MY NAME IS NOEL.

13:49.028 --> 13:52.231
YOU REALLY ARE
SOMETHING SPECIAL.

13:52.631 --> 13:56.235
THAT WOULD'VE KEPT ANYONE
ELSE OUT FOR ANOTHER SIX HOURS.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.436
WELL, GOOD.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.438
THAT'LL GIVE ME MORE
TIME TO KICK YOUR ASS.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.040
YOU WANTED A JOB.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.641
THIS IS HOW IT STARTS.

14:02.641 --> 14:04.243
A PRECAUTION.

14:04.243 --> 14:05.845
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.446
I UNDERSTAND THAT AS
SOON AS I'M BACK ON MY FEET

14:07.847 --> 14:09.448
I'M GOING TO TEAR YOU APART.

14:09.448 --> 14:11.050
I LIKE THE ATTITUDE.

14:11.050 --> 14:13.052
BUT YOU MIGHT FIND
THAT HARDER THAN YOU THINK.

14:13.052 --> 14:16.655
WHERE DID YOU LEARN
TO FIGHT LIKE THAT?

14:17.056 --> 14:18.257
I TOLD YOU.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.859
I KNOW WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

14:20.259 --> 14:21.460
AND WHILE YOU WERE OUT,

14:21.460 --> 14:23.462
I RAN YOUR PRINTS
AND GOT YOUR ARREST RECORDS.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.865
BUT IT DOESN'T ADD UP.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.667
YOU DON'T GET THAT FAST OR THAT
GOOD FIGHTING IN THE STREET.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.470
YOU'VE HAD TRAINING.

14:31.470 --> 14:35.074
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.275
YOU'RE GOOD.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.277
AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

14:38.677 --> 14:41.080
AND THAT MAKES YOU DANGEROUS.

14:41.080 --> 14:43.482
I NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT DANGER ISN'T TO ME.

14:43.482 --> 14:46.685
REST NOW, SHALIMAR.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.889
WE'LL TALK LATER.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.901
ADAM?

15:01.901 --> 15:05.104
ADAM? DAMMIT.

15:26.325 --> 15:27.526
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.929
I TOLD HIM I
WOULDN'T FAIL AGAIN.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.132
PEOPLE ARE BEGINNING TO
LOSE FAITH IN OUR ORGANIZATION.

15:33.132 --> 15:34.733
THAT IS A BAD THING.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.335
NOBODY SHOULD'VE
BEEN ABLE TO STOP SERENA.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.937
YOU KNOW THAT.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.939
ALL I KNOW IS BENJAMIN
MCTEAGUE IS PAYING A PREMIUM FEE

15:40.339 --> 15:42.341
AND DESERVES PREMIUM SERVICE.

15:42.341 --> 15:45.544
WE'LL SEND YOU
ANOTHER OPERATIVE.

15:45.544 --> 15:48.347
NO. I HAVE ONE OF MY OWN.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.349
SOMEONE YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.550
SOMEONE NEW.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.552
YOU'RE THE POINT
PERSON ON THIS MISSION.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.955
YOU'RE RISKING A LOT
ON AN UNTRIED OPERATIVE.

15:56.355 --> 15:59.158
THE ACTION WILL HAPPEN
AS PLANNED, I PROMISE.

15:59.158 --> 16:02.761
REMEMBER, NOEL,
A SECOND CHANCE IS RARE.

16:02.761 --> 16:06.365
BEYOND THAT, THERE IS NOTHING.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.574
ADAM.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.178
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE GETTING
THIS, BUT I HEARD A NAME.

16:19.178 --> 16:22.381
THE ONE WHO'S HIRING
BLUE BOLT IS MCTEAGUE.

16:22.381 --> 16:27.186
THE CLIENT'S NAME
IS BENJAMIN MCTEAGUE.

16:27.586 --> 16:30.389
SHAL, ARE YOU THERE?

16:30.389 --> 16:33.592
SHAL.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.797
MCTEAGUE, IS THAT WHAT SHE SAID?

16:39.198 --> 16:41.200
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.801
WHY, DO YOU KNOW HIM?

16:43.202 --> 16:44.003
YEAH.
HOW?

16:44.403 --> 16:48.807
FOR TEN YEARS,
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

16:59.218 --> 17:01.220
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE RUSHED IT.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.022
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD KEEP
ME IN THERE FOREVER, DID YOU?

17:04.022 --> 17:05.624
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
COULD MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING

17:05.624 --> 17:07.626
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO.

17:07.626 --> 17:12.031
I JUST HOPE WE
WANT THE SAME THINGS.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.636
HEY.

17:18.037 --> 17:21.640
YEAH, I WAS WONDERING HOW
LONG IT WOULD TAKE YOU TO ASK.

17:21.640 --> 17:25.644
SO? WHAT'S GOING
ON? WHO'S MCTEAGUE?

17:25.644 --> 17:28.446
WELL, HE WAS
MY CLOSEST COLLEAGUE.

17:28.446 --> 17:32.851
AND HE'S BRILLIANT,
TALENTED, PASSIONATE.

17:32.851 --> 17:38.057
BUT WE HAD A FALLING
OUT OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.658
YOU KNOW, HE
DROPPED OUT OF SIGHT.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.061
AND I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HIM SINCE.

17:42.461 --> 17:47.666
WELL, IF YOU WERE FRIENDS,
WHY WOULD HE WANT YOU DEAD?

17:47.666 --> 17:49.268
WELL, HE WAS ONE
OF THESE GUYS WHO BELIEVED

17:49.268 --> 17:51.270
IN UNRESTRICTED
RESEARCH, YOU KNOW?

17:51.270 --> 17:53.272
NO MATTER WHAT THE RISK.

17:53.272 --> 17:54.873
WELL, THAT ATTITUDE
COULD JUSTIFY ANYTHING.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.475
THAT'S RIGHT.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.477
AND THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.879
SO WE AGREED TO DISAGREE
AND WE LEFT IT AT THAT.

18:00.879 --> 18:04.083
WELL, THAT'S
A REALLY GOOD STORY.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.686
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME THE REAL ISSUE -

18:07.686 --> 18:09.688
BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WAS A
LOT MORE BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU

18:09.688 --> 18:12.491
THAN JUST PHILOSOPHICAL
DIFFERENCES.

18:12.891 --> 18:14.893
I'M SORRY.

18:14.893 --> 18:18.497
DID I FORGET TO MENTION THAT I
FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE LUCY?

18:23.702 --> 18:26.905
YEAH. I GUESS YOU
DID FORGET TO MENTION THAT.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.521
NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE YOUR STYLE.

18:42.521 --> 18:44.923
WHAT'S IT CALLED?

18:44.923 --> 18:48.927
YOU KEEP YOUR SECRETS.
I'LL KEEP MINE.

18:48.927 --> 18:50.529
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

18:50.529 --> 18:52.131
BETTER.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.933
THAT'S AN INTERESTING TATTOO.

18:54.933 --> 18:59.738
A LOT OF BLOOD WAS
SPILLED TO EARN THIS MARK.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.740
YOU MAY EARN ONE OF YOUR OWN.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
YEAH, WELL, I'M
NOT MUCH OF A JOINER.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.145
I'LL BE HAPPY WITH THE MONEY.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
YOU'RE A LONE WOLF. LIKE ME.

19:08.147 --> 19:11.750
BUT EVEN A LONE WOLF
NEEDS A PACK AT TIMES.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.352
WELL, GIVE ME A JOB.

19:13.352 --> 19:17.356
SHOW ME WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO BE IN YOUR PACK.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.159
YOU PROVE YOURSELF TO ME,

19:20.559 --> 19:23.762
SHALIMAR, AND
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR JOB.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.165
DIDN'T I PROVE MYSELF TONIGHT?

19:26.165 --> 19:28.167
ANYONE CAN FIGHT.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.169
I HAVE TO SEE YOU KILL.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.380
ADAM, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
CAN HEAR ME, BUT I NEED BACKUP.

19:42.581 --> 19:43.782
ADAM, COME HERE.

19:43.782 --> 19:44.583
I'M GETTING SOMETHING
FROM SHALIMAR.

19:44.983 --> 19:46.185
SHALIMAR, IT'S
OKAY, I'VE GOT YOU.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.786
GO AHEAD. I'VE BOOSTED
UP HER SIGNAL AND GOT HER.

19:47.786 --> 19:48.987
I'VE EVEN GOT A LOCATION ON HER.

19:49.388 --> 19:50.989
LOOK, I'M IN, BUT
HE WANTS ME TO PROVE MYSELF.

19:50.989 --> 19:52.591
HE'S ASKED ME
TO KILL SOMEONE FOR HIM.

19:52.591 --> 19:55.394
ALL RIGHT. WE'VE
GOT YOUR LOCATION.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.595
WE'VE GOT THE NAME MCTEAGUE.

19:56.995 --> 19:58.597
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO GET YOU OUT.

19:58.597 --> 19:59.398
BRENNAN?

19:59.798 --> 20:00.599
NO, YOU CAN'T.

20:00.999 --> 20:02.601
HE'LL JUST SEND SOMEONE
ELSE IN TO TAKE YOU OUT.

20:02.601 --> 20:05.003
I NEED TO GET THIS ASSIGNMENT.

20:05.003 --> 20:06.605
ALL RIGHT. YOU STAY ON IT.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.607
DO AS HE TELLS YOU.
WE'LL BE THERE.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.609
YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY
EXPECT HER TO KILL SOMEBODY.

20:10.609 --> 20:12.211
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.814
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE
TO PROVIDE THE VICTIM.

20:19.818 --> 20:21.820
YOU CAN FEEL IT, CAN'T YOU?

20:21.820 --> 20:23.422
THE NIGHT.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.824
IT'S ALMOST LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO USE YOUR EYES TO SEE.

20:25.824 --> 20:28.227
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.828
BECAUSE YOU'RE LIKE ME.

20:29.828 --> 20:32.231
WE DO OUR BEST WORK AT NIGHT.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.832
IT'S WHEN YOU'RE MOST ALIVE.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.434
YOU THINK WE'RE ALIKE?

20:35.434 --> 20:37.436
I KNOW WE ARE.

20:37.836 --> 20:39.838
I'VE SEEN YOU FIGHT, REMEMBER?

20:40.239 --> 20:42.241
FOR PEOPLE LIKE US,
IT'S NOT JUST VIOLENCE.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.243
IT'S A COMMUNICATION.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.645
IT'S LIKE POETRY.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.448
THAT'S A LOT TO PULL FROM
ME POUNDING A FEW GUYS ON A BAR.

20:49.448 --> 20:53.452
IT TELLS ME A LOT ABOUT
THE KIND OF LOVER YOU ARE, TOO.

20:53.852 --> 20:55.854
AND WHAT KIND OF LOVER AM I?

20:55.854 --> 20:58.257
YOU TAKE NO PRISONERS,
AND YOU DESERVE THE BEST.

20:58.257 --> 21:01.460
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST IS.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.061
I DO.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.464
IT'S SOMEONE WHO APPRECIATES
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.466
EVERYTHING YOU
BRING TO THE TABLE.

21:07.466 --> 21:11.069
AND WHO'LL LET
YOU GO AS FAR AS YOU CAN.

21:11.069 --> 21:15.874
YOU KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO MIGHT FIT THAT BILL?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.077
YOU KNOW, I JUST MIGHT.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.488
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT A TEST.

21:29.488 --> 21:31.890
YOU HAVE SOMEBODY PICKED OUT?

21:31.890 --> 21:33.892
THEY'LL PRESENT
THEMSELVES TO US.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.494
PRESENT THEMSELVES?

21:35.894 --> 21:37.496
IT WILL BE SOMEONE
WHO DOESN'T EXPECT IT.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.898
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T DESERVE IT.

21:39.898 --> 21:42.701
SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T
EVEN SUSPECT THERE ARE
PEOPLE LIKE US OUT THERE.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.703
WHAT ARE PEOPLE LIKE US?

21:44.703 --> 21:49.107
PEOPLE WHO ENJOY IT.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.510
JESSE, YOU GET THAT?

21:51.510 --> 21:53.111
I GOT 'EM. THEY'RE
HEADING MY WAY.

21:53.111 --> 21:54.313
GOOD.

21:54.713 --> 21:55.914
I HOPE YOU GOT
YOUR VICTIM LOOK DOWN.

21:55.914 --> 21:57.516
I'M ALL OVER IT.

21:57.516 --> 21:59.518
I'M GONNA MEET THEM
HALF WAY DOWN THE BLOCK.

21:59.518 --> 22:01.520
EMMA, MAKE SURE
NOBODY ENTERS THE STREET
FROM YOUR END, ALL RIGHT?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.522
OKAY.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.725
AND THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES.

22:10.329 --> 22:11.930
WHERE'D HE COME FROM?

22:11.930 --> 22:13.131
I DON'T KNOW.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.133
HE WASN'T THERE A MINUTE AGO.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.936
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO PROVE YOURSELF.

22:17.936 --> 22:22.341
I AM.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.749
WITH HIM.

22:30.749 --> 22:31.950
HE'S YOUNGER.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.952
MORE OF AN OPPONENT.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.954
MAYBE YOU DO HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

22:45.564 --> 22:47.966
LOOK HIM RIGHT IN
THE EYE WHEN YOU DO IT.

22:47.966 --> 22:50.369
MAKE IT UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL.

22:50.769 --> 22:51.970
JESSE, SHE'S GOT A KNIFE.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.572
THE BULLETPROOF VEST
ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT.

22:53.572 --> 22:54.773
JESSE, YOU HAVE TO PULL OUT.

22:54.773 --> 22:56.375
IF YOU PHASE
HE'S GOING TO SEE IT.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.576
OKAY, CHANGE OF PLANS.
I'M GOING TO PHASE THE KNIFE.

22:57.976 --> 22:58.777
JESSE, NO.

22:58.777 --> 22:59.978
IT'S THE ONLY WAY.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.381
JESS!

23:17.195 --> 23:19.197
I HOPE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.604
UGH...

23:26.004 --> 23:28.407
OH...

23:28.407 --> 23:31.209
OH...

23:51.229 --> 23:52.831
SO I GOT THE JOB?

23:53.231 --> 23:57.235
THAT... AND I
DON'T HAVE TO KILL YOU.

23:57.235 --> 24:02.040
YOU GET YOUR FIRST
ASSIGNMENT TOMORROW.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.445
CONGRATULATIONS.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.632
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE THINKING, JESSE.

24:27.632 --> 24:29.634
IF YOU DIDN'T PHASE THAT BLADE
AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT

24:29.634 --> 24:30.836
SHE'D HAVE OPENED YOU UP.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.238
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
MY TIMING IS IMPECCABLE.

24:33.238 --> 24:34.439
YEAH.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.441
LUCKY -- THIS TIME.

24:36.441 --> 24:38.844
WHY IS IT THAT WHEN
YOU TAKE CHANCES THEY'RE
CALLED CALCULATED RISKS?

24:38.844 --> 24:41.246
WELL, BECAUSE
I DO THE CALCULATIONS.

24:41.246 --> 24:44.049
AT LEAST, NOW WE HAVE A
FIX ON BLUE BOLT'S HEADQUARTERS

24:44.049 --> 24:46.051
WE'LL BE ABLE TO KEEP
TABS ON EVERY MOVE THIS NOEL

24:46.051 --> 24:48.854
GUY MAKES RIGHT
UP UNTIL THE CONFERENCE.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.256
HEY, YOU KNOW,
IS THIS STRIKING ANYBODY
ELSE AS BEING WAY TOO EASY?

24:51.656 --> 24:53.658
I MEAN, SHE MEETS HIM IN A
BAR, AND THE VERY NEXT DAY HE'S

24:53.658 --> 24:55.660
TRUSTING HER WITH
AN IMPORTANT MISSION?

24:55.660 --> 24:56.862
SHE PROVED HERSELF.

24:57.262 --> 24:58.864
AND, IN CASE
YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

24:58.864 --> 25:00.465
SHAL CAN BE PRETTY PERSUASIVE.

25:00.465 --> 25:02.067
JUST THE SAME, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR THEM TO START MAKING THEIR

25:02.467 --> 25:04.069
MOVES SO WE
CAN START MAKING OURS.

25:12.077 --> 25:13.678
SO ARE YOU GOING
TO TELL ME ABOUT THE JOB?

25:14.079 --> 25:16.081
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN
THE TIME IS RIGHT.

25:18.884 --> 25:20.886
YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.288
SHOULD I?

25:26.892 --> 25:29.294
I'M GOING TO
KILL SOMEONE FOR YOU.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.495
DON'T FOOL YOURSELF.

25:30.896 --> 25:32.097
YOU'RE DOING IT FOR YOU.

25:32.097 --> 25:33.298
MAYBE. BUT I'M STILL CURIOUS.

25:33.698 --> 25:34.900
WHO IS HE?

25:34.900 --> 25:36.101
WHY DOES HE HAVE TO DIE?

25:36.501 --> 25:37.702
HE? I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS A MAN.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.304
I JUST ASSUMED.

25:39.304 --> 25:40.505
YOU WOULDN'T
HURT A LADY, WOULD YOU?

25:40.906 --> 25:42.107
HE'S NOBODY.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.308
HE'S THE GUY IN THE STREET.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.310
HE'S THE TARGET.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.712
AND HE HAS TO DIE
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S PAYING
US TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

25:47.712 --> 25:48.914
I KEEP IT THAT SIMPLE.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.515
YOU WILL, TOO.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.720
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
COMPLICATED IN YOUR LIFE?

25:55.720 --> 25:56.922
YOU.

25:56.922 --> 25:58.123
ME?

25:58.123 --> 26:00.525
BEFORE YESTERDAY,
I'D NEVER SET EYES ON YOU.

26:00.525 --> 26:02.928
BUT I FEEL LIKE
I'VE KNOWN YOU FOREVER.

26:02.928 --> 26:05.730
YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE
ME IF YOU KNEW ME BETTER.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.133
I KNOW WHATEVER I NEED TO KNOW.

26:16.942 --> 26:18.543
NICE MOVE.

26:18.944 --> 26:20.545
YOU GONNA FINISH ME OFF?

26:20.545 --> 26:22.147
I CAN'T.

26:22.147 --> 26:25.750
I THINK YOU'VE
COMPLICATED MY LIFE, TOO.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.354
SAY "UNCLE".

26:47.772 --> 26:49.774
I RAN A SEARCH OF ALL THE
COMPANIES THAT COULD BE AFFECTED

26:50.175 --> 26:51.376
BY YOUR UPCOMING SPEECH.

26:51.776 --> 26:52.978
AND NO MCTEAGUE.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.380
HOWEVER,
I DID A CROSS-REFERENCE,
AND CAME UP WITH...

26:55.780 --> 26:57.782
THE PHOENIX CORPORATION.

26:57.782 --> 26:58.984
PHOENIX.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.185
YEAH, I KNOW THE NAME.

27:00.185 --> 27:01.786
THEY PROVIDE RESEARCH TO A
LOT OF THE COMPANIES THAT WOULD

27:01.786 --> 27:03.388
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY SPEECH.

27:03.788 --> 27:04.990
THAT'S RIGHT. THE
POWER BEHIND THE POWER.

27:04.990 --> 27:06.191
GUESS WHAT I FOUND?

27:06.591 --> 27:08.193
THE MASTHEAD OF THE COMPANY,
THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD --

27:08.593 --> 27:10.195
BENJAMIN MCTEAGUE.

27:10.195 --> 27:13.798
TIME TO PAY A VISIT.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.400
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
JUST WALTZ RIGHT IN THERE?

27:15.400 --> 27:17.002
WELL, YEAH. HE'S NOT GOING
TO HAVE HIS KILLERS WITH HIM.

27:17.002 --> 27:18.603
IT'S THE LAST PLACE
HE'D EXPECT TO SEE ME.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.205
OKAY. BUT, WHAT? SO... SO, WHAT?

27:20.205 --> 27:21.806
HE'S JUST GOING TO CANCEL
THE HIT BECAUSE YOU ASK HIM TO?

27:21.806 --> 27:23.008
WELL, I THINK HE'LL
THINK TWICE ABOUT IT,

27:23.408 --> 27:25.410
KNOWING WE'RE ON TO HIM.

27:25.410 --> 27:27.012
YEAH. YOU STAY HERE,
YOU MONITOR SHALIMAR.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.814
BRENNAN! EMMA! IN
THE HELIX. FIVE MINUTES.

27:35.020 --> 27:40.625
SAW YOU ON MY SECURITY
SCREEN. VERY IMPRESSIVE.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.627
I'M LOOKING
FOR BENJAMIN MCTEAGUE.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.629
YOU FOUND HIM.

27:44.629 --> 27:47.432
YOU'RE HIS SON?

27:47.832 --> 27:49.434
MY FATHER DIED FIVE YEARS AGO,

27:49.434 --> 27:52.237
BUT I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU TWO WERE CLOSE AT THE END.

27:52.237 --> 27:53.838
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO KILL ME.

27:53.838 --> 27:58.243
I WAS GIVEN HIS NAME AS
THE PERSON WHO'S RESPONSIBLE.

27:58.243 --> 27:59.844
BUT IT'S YOU.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.846
THAT'S A POWERFUL ACCUSATION.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.249
ANY PROOF?

28:04.249 --> 28:05.850
YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.852
THEN I WOULDN'T
GO SPREADING IT AROUND.

28:07.852 --> 28:10.655
WILD ACCUSATIONS MIGHT
DAMAGE YOUR CREDIBILITY,

28:10.655 --> 28:12.257
AND I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
GOING TO NEED THAT LATER TODAY

28:12.257 --> 28:14.259
FOR THE SENATE CONFERENCE.

28:14.259 --> 28:15.860
RIGHT, SO IS THAT
WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

28:15.860 --> 28:17.462
ABOUT YOUR FUNDING
FOR GENETIC RESEARCH?

28:17.862 --> 28:19.064
OBVIOUSLY, YOU GUYS HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY WHATEVER

28:19.464 --> 28:20.665
INFLUENCE YOU NEED.

28:21.066 --> 28:25.870
IF I WANTED TO KILL SOMEONE,
IT WOULDN'T BE ABOUT MONEY.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.472
THEN WHAT?

28:27.472 --> 28:30.275
YOU KNOW, I'M ALMOST
SURPRISED YOU HAVEN'T
ASKED ME ABOUT MY MOTHER.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.277
HOW IS SHE?

28:32.277 --> 28:35.080
DEAD.

28:38.683 --> 28:41.886
SHE WAS A WONDERFUL WOMAN.
I'M VERY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.689
YEAH, BUT NOT SO SORRY THAT
YOU EVER INQUIRED AFTER HER.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.092
SHE DIED WHEN
I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD.

28:47.492 --> 28:51.896
SHE LEFT MY FATHER A FEW YEARS
AFTER YOU TWO WERE TOGETHER.

28:51.896 --> 28:56.701
I MEAN, YOU AND
MY FATHER, OF COURSE.

28:56.701 --> 29:00.305
WHEN YOUR FATHER AND
I STOPPED WORKING TOGETHER

29:00.305 --> 29:02.307
THINGS WERE PRETTY COMPLICATED.

29:02.307 --> 29:03.908
OH, I'M SURE THEY WERE.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.510
LOOK, WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT WHO WAS TRYING TO KILL ME.

29:05.510 --> 29:07.112
OH, WERE WE?

29:07.112 --> 29:08.713
SEE, I WASN'T SURE WHETHER
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GENETIC

29:08.713 --> 29:12.717
RESEARCH, MY SAD
FAMILY SITUATION OR WHAT...

29:12.717 --> 29:16.721
BY THE WAY, DID I
MENTION HOW MY FATHER DIED?

29:16.721 --> 29:21.926
KILLED HIMSELF. SHORTLY
AFTER MY MOTHER LEFT HIM.

29:21.926 --> 29:27.132
HE WAS A SAD MAN. A WOUNDED MAN.

29:27.132 --> 29:30.735
FIRST, A WEDGE WAS
DRIVEN INTO HIS MARRIAGE.

29:30.735 --> 29:33.138
AND NOW, AFTER ALL THIS TIME,

29:33.138 --> 29:35.940
SOMEONE THREATENS
TO DESTROY HIS COMPANY.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.343
YOU MAY KNOW SOMETHING, OR THINK
YOU KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT

29:38.743 --> 29:40.745
HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOUR PARENTS AND ME WHILE
WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.747
BUT YOU DON'T.

29:42.747 --> 29:44.349
YOUR FATHER AND
I HAD OUR DIFFERENCES.

29:44.349 --> 29:45.950
HE WAS A BRILLIANT MAN.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.152
BUT HE LOST HIMSELF.

29:47.152 --> 29:49.154
HE WAS WHAT HE WAS.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.956
AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO TALK ABOUT HIM LIKE THAT.

29:51.956 --> 29:56.761
LEAVE MY OFFICE... NOW.

29:56.761 --> 29:59.564
I'M GOING TO SPEAK
AT THIS CONFERENCE TODAY.

29:59.564 --> 30:02.367
AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

30:02.367 --> 30:07.572
YOU KNOW, MY MOTHER, SHE
USED TO TALK ABOUT YOU LIKE YOU

30:07.572 --> 30:09.974
WERE SOME KIND OF HERO.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.976
BUT NOW?

30:12.377 --> 30:14.379
NOW I SEE IT'S MORE LIKE A...

30:14.379 --> 30:19.584
LIKE A HERO COMPLEX.

30:19.584 --> 30:21.586
I'M GOING TO SPEAK
AT THIS CONFERENCE NO MATTER

30:21.586 --> 30:22.787
WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR BUSINESS,

30:22.787 --> 30:24.389
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME,

30:24.789 --> 30:28.793
AND THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.998
ADAM, I'M SENSING
THERE'S MORE SECURITY.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.401
WE GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.210
GET ME THE OPERATIVE
IMMEDIATELY.

30:45.210 --> 30:48.012
YES, SIR.

30:49.214 --> 30:51.616
NICE TO FINALLY
MEET YOU, ADAM KANE.

30:51.616 --> 30:54.419
TOO BAD THERE'LL
NEVER BE A SECOND MEETING.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.912
I'M A VERY BAD
PERSON TO SNEAK UP ON.

31:20.912 --> 31:22.914
I SEE THAT.

31:25.316 --> 31:27.318
SO, WHEN ARE WE HEADING OUT?

31:27.318 --> 31:28.920
SOON.

31:32.523 --> 31:34.525
YES.

31:34.525 --> 31:37.729
THERE COULD BE NO LEAK.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.332
IF SOMEONE KNOWS,
IT'S FROM THE MAN HIMSELF.

31:41.332 --> 31:43.735
THE PLAN IS IN PLACE.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.537
IT WILL GO OFF AS ARRANGED.

31:50.541 --> 31:53.745
I'M GOING TO GO GET READY.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.159
SO, WHAT WAS THAT ALL
ABOUT AT MCTEAGUE'S OFFICE?

32:08.159 --> 32:12.964
I'M NOT SURE.

32:12.964 --> 32:17.368
YOU REALLY CARED
ABOUT HIS MOTHER.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.771
LUCY AND I KNEW THAT IT
WAS UNFAIR TO BEN TO CONTINUE,

32:19.771 --> 32:22.173
SO I LEFT IT UP
TO HER TO MAKE A CHOICE,

32:22.573 --> 32:24.976
AND SHE DID WHAT
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD TO DO.

32:24.976 --> 32:27.378
SHE STAYED WITH HIM.

32:27.378 --> 32:33.384
AND DO YOU THINK THE SON
KNOWS ABOUT YOU AND HIS MOTHER?

32:33.384 --> 32:36.187
WELL, HE DID
EVERYTHING BUT SAY SO.

32:36.187 --> 32:38.990
AND I THINK THAT HIS ANGER
IS AS MUCH ABOUT HIS PERCEPTION

32:39.390 --> 32:41.793
THAT I SOMEHOW BROKE UP HIS
PARENTS' MARRIAGE AS IT IS ABOUT

32:41.793 --> 32:46.197
MY SPEECH AT THE CONVENTION.

32:46.197 --> 32:49.801
YOU KNOW, I GOT A HIT
OFF HIM WHEN I WAS IN THERE.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.402
AND?

32:51.402 --> 32:54.605
HIS MIND IS FILLED WITH
HATE AND ANGER AND LOVE AND ALL

32:54.605 --> 32:57.008
OF THEM WAY OFF THE SCALE.

32:57.008 --> 32:58.609
SO YOU THINK HE'S DANGEROUS?

32:58.609 --> 33:00.211
NO, I THINK HE'S
MORE THAN DANGEROUS, ADAM.

33:00.611 --> 33:03.414
I THINK HE'S INSANE.

33:03.414 --> 33:07.018
ALL RIGHT.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.821
LOOK, IT'S ALMOST TIME
TO GO TO THE CONVENTION.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.223
I'M GOING TO GET READY.

33:12.623 --> 33:14.225
YOU GET THE OTHERS.
-OKAY.

33:17.028 --> 33:18.629
READY TO GO?

33:19.030 --> 33:20.231
ALMOST.

33:20.631 --> 33:24.235
THERE'S BEEN A BREACH
IN THE ORGANISATION'S SECURITY.

33:24.235 --> 33:26.237
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO US?

33:26.237 --> 33:28.239
MAYBE NOTHING.

33:28.639 --> 33:31.843
THIS IS THE TARGET?

33:31.843 --> 33:34.245
HE INTENDS TO SPEAK
AT A GENETICS CONFERENCE.

33:34.245 --> 33:36.247
WE HAVE TO STOP
HIM BEFORE HE DOES.

33:36.247 --> 33:38.249
WHAT IF HE HAS BACKUP?

33:38.249 --> 33:39.851
I HAVE TO ASSUME HE WILL.

33:39.851 --> 33:43.054
HENCE, MY CHOICE OF WEAPONS.

33:43.454 --> 33:45.056
IMPRESSIVE.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.458
WE'VE OBTAINED THE TARGET'S DNA.

33:47.458 --> 33:51.462
IT'S BEEN PROGRAMMED
INTO THE WEAPON'S AMMUNITION.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.064
PROGRAMMED?

33:53.064 --> 33:55.466
THE PROJECTILE IS
ESSENTIALLY A GUIDED MISSILE.

33:55.466 --> 33:58.669
WHEN YOU FIRE THIS
FROM WITHIN A THIRTY-FOOT
RADIUS OF THE TARGET,

33:59.070 --> 34:00.671
THE CHARGES WILL TRACK
THE TARGET NO MATTER HOW

34:00.671 --> 34:02.273
HE TRIES TO EVADE IT.

34:02.273 --> 34:03.875
WOW.

34:03.875 --> 34:08.679
WHERE'S THE
LATCH TO TAKE IT OFF?

34:08.679 --> 34:11.081
THERE IS NONE.

34:11.081 --> 34:14.685
THE SECURITY BREACH
HAS MY PEOPLE WORRIED.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.687
IT HAS ME WORRIED.

34:16.687 --> 34:18.688
IF YOU TRY TO REMOVE
THE WEAPON BEFORE IT TAKES OUT

34:18.688 --> 34:21.492
THE TARGET,
IT WILL SELF-DESTRUCT.

34:21.492 --> 34:25.897
AND IT'LL TAKE OUT
YOUR ARM UP TO THE SHOULDER.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.299
WHY?

34:28.299 --> 34:31.101
YOU CAN DO THIS, SHALIMAR.

34:31.101 --> 34:35.907
YOU PROVE YOURSELF HERE, AND
WE CAN DISAPPEAR FOR A WHILE.

34:35.907 --> 34:43.114
TRAVEL THE WORLD,
AND HUNT IN OTHER CITIES.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.516
TAKE THIS OFF ME.

34:45.516 --> 34:49.920
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.
JUST DO THE JOB.

34:49.920 --> 34:53.524
AND THEN WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.937
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU
KNOW YOUR ASSIGNMENTS.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.538
THE MINUTE SHALIMAR'S COMLINK
BECOMES ACTIVE YOU LOCATE HER,

35:07.538 --> 35:08.739
SHUT DOWN WHOEVER'S WITH HER.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.341
YOU TELL ME WHENEVER
YOU SENSE SOMETHING.

35:10.341 --> 35:11.943
YOU GOT IT.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.548
THE BEST PLACE TO MAKE THE
SHOT IS THE CONFERENCE CENTRE.

35:17.548 --> 35:18.749
THERE'LL BE NOWHERE TO HIDE.

35:19.150 --> 35:20.351
DON'T WORRY.

35:20.351 --> 35:21.552
I'LL BE COVERING THE BALCONY.

35:21.552 --> 35:24.355
I'LL TAKE OUT ANYONE
WHO'S PROTECTING HIM.

35:24.355 --> 35:27.959
NOEL, WHAT HAPPENS
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

35:27.959 --> 35:31.963
DON'T LET IT.

35:36.367 --> 35:38.369
IF ANYONE CAN HEAR
THIS, I'M IN THE BUILDING.

35:38.369 --> 35:39.570
WHERE?

35:39.570 --> 35:40.771
SECOND FLOOR.

35:40.771 --> 35:42.373
HE WANTS ME TO MAKE THE
HIT IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

35:42.773 --> 35:47.979
MY BACKUP'S GOING
TO BE ON THE BALCONY.

35:49.580 --> 35:51.182
I GOT HIM.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.383
HE'S GOING TO BE TRYING
TO TAKE OUT ADAM'S PROTECTION,

35:52.383 --> 35:54.385
SO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, GUYS.

35:54.385 --> 35:55.987
YOU GOT THAT, ADAM?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.989
ALL RIGHT, BRENNAN,
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT
TAKING OUT THE BACKUP.

35:58.389 --> 35:59.590
WAIT, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.192
ADAM, HE STRAPPED SOME
KIND OF WEAPON ONTO MY ARM.

36:01.592 --> 36:05.596
IT'S KEYED IN TO YOUR DNA
AND IF I DON'T SHOOT YOU IT'S

36:05.596 --> 36:07.999
GOING TO SELF-DESTRUCT
AND TAKE OFF MY ARM.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.602
JESSE, YOU THINK
YOU CAN PHASE THAT OFF HER?

36:12.003 --> 36:14.005
SENSOR'S PROBABLY WIRED TO BLOW
THE MOMENT IT LEAVES HER ARM.

36:14.405 --> 36:16.407
NAH, IT'LL GO
OFF AS SOON AS I START.

36:16.407 --> 36:18.009
ALL RIGHT.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.610
WELL, LISTEN, TEAM, WE
GOTTA COME UP WITH SOMETHING.

36:19.610 --> 36:21.612
OR ONE OF US IS GOING TO DIE.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.690
I CAN'T DO THIS, ADAM.

37:39.690 --> 37:41.692
WHAT IF SOMETHING DOES WRONG?

37:41.692 --> 37:43.294
SHALIMAR, WE
DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

37:43.294 --> 37:45.296
I WANT YOU TO
PULL THE TRIGGER...

37:46.497 --> 37:48.099
NOW.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.907
JESS!

38:05.716 --> 38:08.119
HEY! JUST DIDN'T DESERVE HER.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.330
JESSE, DON'T.

38:22.933 --> 38:24.935
HE'S MINE.

38:26.537 --> 38:28.539
THINGS COULD'VE TURNED
OUT DIFFERENTLY, SHALIMAR.

38:28.539 --> 38:30.141
NO, THEY COULDN'T.

38:30.541 --> 38:32.143
ONE OF MY FRIENDS WOULD BE DEAD.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.346
WE ALL HAVE TO DIE SOMETIME.

38:35.746 --> 38:37.348
ARGH...!

39:07.778 --> 39:08.979
DON'T DO THIS, NOEL.

39:08.979 --> 39:11.382
YOU KNOW ME.

39:11.782 --> 39:14.185
YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

39:14.585 --> 39:16.587
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.211
OH, HEY, SHAL. LOOK,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.812
I WAS...

39:41.812 --> 39:43.414
YOU KNOW, I JUST
WANTED TO SAY, YEAH,

39:43.414 --> 39:46.217
I WAS OVERPROTECTIVE,
BUT I NEVER UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

39:46.217 --> 39:47.818
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T JUST
GO THROUGH THE ROOF WITH WORRY

39:47.818 --> 39:49.820
EVERY TIME I
GO OUT ON A MISSION.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.021
YEAH, I KNOW.

39:51.021 --> 39:52.623
OKAY, I MEAN,

39:52.623 --> 39:55.826
I KNOW YOU COULD PROBABLY TAKE
ME TO PIECES IF YOU WANTED TO.

39:55.826 --> 39:57.428
OBVIOUSLY.

39:57.428 --> 40:00.231
YEAH.

40:04.635 --> 40:07.438
YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST
THINKING, WHEN YOU'RE IN THERE,

40:07.438 --> 40:11.442
WITH HIM, WHAT IF
YOU NEVER CAME BACK TO...

40:11.842 --> 40:13.444
TO US, YOU KNOW?

40:13.444 --> 40:15.446
THE TEAM.

40:15.446 --> 40:18.249
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE LIKE?

40:18.649 --> 40:23.053
FOR THE TEAM?

40:23.053 --> 40:25.856
WELL, I...

40:25.856 --> 40:32.663
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'D DO WITHOUT YOU.

40:32.663 --> 40:35.866
THAT'S NICE.

40:58.289 --> 41:02.693
HEY.
-YOU OKAY?

41:02.693 --> 41:05.496
YEAH, I THINK THE
CONFERENCE WENT WELL.

41:05.896 --> 41:08.699
I THINK I TURNED
A FEW POLITICIANS' HEADS.

41:09.099 --> 41:11.502
AND NOW, IF THE BIG MONEY
LOBBYISTS DON'T TURN THEM BACK

41:11.502 --> 41:14.305
THEN- I MEANT ABOUT MCTEAGUE'S
SON TRYING TO KILL YOU.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.107
YEAH, WELL, CAN'T
SAY THAT THAT MADE MY DAY.

41:17.508 --> 41:20.711
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TALK TO THE POLICE.

41:21.111 --> 41:22.313
NO, BECAUSE WE DON'T
HAVE ANY HARD PROOF THAT HE'S

41:22.713 --> 41:24.315
THE ONE WHO ORDERED THE HIT.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.518
YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF SOUNDS
LIKE YOU'RE PROTECTING HIM.

41:27.518 --> 41:29.119
WELL, MAYBE I AM.

41:29.119 --> 41:31.922
ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHY.

41:32.323 --> 41:33.924
WELL, HE'S THE
SON OF SOMEONE YOU LOVED.

41:33.924 --> 41:37.928
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU OWE HER.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.331
MAYBE I DO.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.333
YEAH, BUT, YOU CAN'T JUST
CLOSE YOUR EYES AND PRETEND

41:42.333 --> 41:44.735
IT'S ALL BETTER NOW.

41:44.735 --> 41:50.341
BECAUSE BEN IS STILL
OUT THERE. AND HE'S INSANE.
