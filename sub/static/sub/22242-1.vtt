00:59.817 --> 01:00.785
Hey!

01:03.387 --> 01:05.253
I'm like the anti-Gandhi.

01:05.254 --> 01:07.458
Yeah.

01:12.996 --> 01:16.866
So, what are we gonna do with
ourselves this summer, Madam Iris?

01:16.868 --> 01:19.601
Write a musical. Take it on the road.

01:19.603 --> 01:23.238
- Run for mayor. My platform is "child labor."
- Oh.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.507
- Why not?
- You're so refreshingly candid.

01:26.509 --> 01:28.810
We have an entire summer.
We can do whatever.

01:28.812 --> 01:30.646
Quality time.

01:30.648 --> 01:32.150
My goal is to heal.

01:36.553 --> 01:38.823
Mmm, wait, wait. I want
to light my cigarette.

01:41.859 --> 01:42.961
Mmm.

01:43.660 --> 01:44.829
To our health.

01:51.101 --> 01:52.202
To our health.

01:55.271 --> 01:56.907
Uh... Swiss.

01:57.907 --> 01:58.876
Okay.

02:00.077 --> 02:01.709
So, you work here?

02:01.711 --> 02:03.446
I'm an unpaid intern.

02:05.148 --> 02:06.650
Uh, you were in my Af-Am Poets, right?

02:07.216 --> 02:09.150
Yeah.

02:09.151 --> 02:11.287
What are you doing on campus?

02:11.289 --> 02:13.322
- I live here.
- Ansbury?

02:13.324 --> 02:14.990
- No way.
- Yeah.

02:14.992 --> 02:17.025
I'm a townie.

02:17.027 --> 02:19.394
I'm at Admissions. We should hang out.

02:19.396 --> 02:20.365
Iris, right?

02:22.199 --> 02:23.201
Sweet.

02:23.901 --> 02:24.903
Jason?

02:25.569 --> 02:26.704
Cody?

02:28.272 --> 02:29.905
Wyatt?

02:29.907 --> 02:31.105
Alex.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.873
- Alex.
- Alex.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.842
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

02:34.844 --> 02:35.879
Mmm.

02:36.914 --> 02:38.049
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.518
Uh...

02:43.420 --> 02:45.456
Do you have any pimento loaf?

02:46.223 --> 02:47.225
No.

03:56.826 --> 03:58.525
Is it icy?

03:58.527 --> 04:01.229
It looks nippily.

04:01.231 --> 04:03.865
I don't know, Catherine,
I haven't been in yet.

04:03.867 --> 04:07.203
Iris, there comes a time
in every young woman's life

04:07.205 --> 04:11.806
where she retires her disposable
razor, and starts to wax.

04:11.808 --> 04:13.775
I'll give you my lady, her number.

04:13.777 --> 04:14.979
I'm on a budget.

04:27.358 --> 04:28.860
It's amazing!

04:36.267 --> 04:38.165
Caramel-flavored liquor.

04:38.167 --> 04:41.068
I feel like this changes a person, forever.

04:46.243 --> 04:47.277
Yeah.

06:04.722 --> 06:08.957
Mmm. I feel like Brixner is
absolutely a great school,

06:08.959 --> 06:11.325
but I could never stay here for college.

06:11.327 --> 06:14.528
Well, Iris is still functioning at a
high level and she lives here year-round.

06:14.530 --> 06:17.131
Yeah, but Iris is of hearty stock, though.

06:17.133 --> 06:18.599
I'm more neurotic.

06:18.601 --> 06:20.801
I need New York.

06:20.803 --> 06:22.604
Suburbs do rot your brain.

06:22.606 --> 06:24.806
That's kind of what my thesis is about.

06:24.808 --> 06:26.941
Cultural values in the suburbs.

06:26.943 --> 06:29.878
Basically, I contend that with the
absence of community institutions,

06:29.880 --> 06:32.647
like Little League and church,

06:32.649 --> 06:34.917
children are allowed to
develop their own morality.

06:34.919 --> 06:38.052
Like, for instance, let's
say, grow up in a family...

06:38.054 --> 06:39.456
- Ready?
- Mmm?

06:41.459 --> 06:43.659
- Okay, hello.
- Oh.

06:43.661 --> 06:46.962
All right, hey, you there?

06:46.964 --> 06:49.063
- All right, let's go.
- Oh, shit.

06:49.065 --> 06:51.532
Hold... Guys?

06:51.534 --> 06:53.234
Wait. Uh, I'll drive?

06:53.236 --> 06:55.106
- Let's walk.
- Okay.

07:01.811 --> 07:03.410
You know what would be truly amazing,

07:03.412 --> 07:06.414
is if it would just be 1% more humid,

07:06.416 --> 07:08.386
and then we would all drown!

07:09.919 --> 07:12.421
This is exactly like high school.

07:12.423 --> 07:16.458
It's fucking, creepy, time-warp shit.

07:16.460 --> 07:19.695
Only you would be wearing a fleece.

07:19.697 --> 07:23.131
And Mae would be talking
about how she hates everyone.

07:23.133 --> 07:25.333
Oh, and she'd be asking, "Where's the keg?"

07:25.335 --> 07:27.602
What would Catherine be doing?

07:27.604 --> 07:30.741
This. This is Catherine right here.

07:31.775 --> 07:33.508
Different hair.

07:33.510 --> 07:35.544
I know.

07:35.546 --> 07:39.047
- Man, this is devil shit. It's crazy.
- Mmm.

07:39.049 --> 07:41.852
I steeped the vodka in weed.

07:42.919 --> 07:44.854
- Keg ahoy!
- Oh, shit.

07:44.856 --> 07:46.690
Fuck you.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.094
Yeah, it's good.

07:53.096 --> 07:55.229
So... Oh, shit.

07:55.231 --> 07:57.368
Okay, let's do it. Do it.

08:01.972 --> 08:04.008
Sorry. I'm sorry.

08:07.344 --> 08:08.379
Hey.

08:11.382 --> 08:12.981
Thanks.

08:12.983 --> 08:14.414
I wanna go home.

08:14.416 --> 08:16.551
- What?
- Really?

08:16.553 --> 08:21.256
But why? You're completely,
inappropriately sober.

08:21.258 --> 08:24.059
Have a beer at least. It'll be fun.

08:24.061 --> 08:26.664
I can't get Billy out of my head. I...

08:28.397 --> 08:29.833
He hates us.

08:31.734 --> 08:35.669
He will, he truly will,
for the rest of his life,

08:35.672 --> 08:40.341
so either you obsess over
something you can't change

08:40.342 --> 08:43.979
or you just accept it and move on.

08:43.981 --> 08:46.583
It's only been four months, Catherine.

08:48.518 --> 08:51.921
I still wake up thinking she's here.

08:51.923 --> 08:53.758
Then you have a serious problem.

08:58.928 --> 09:00.427
- Hey, Jack.
- Yo.

09:00.429 --> 09:03.398
Can you drive Catherine home later?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.569
Yeah, with aplomb, sure.

09:06.602 --> 09:07.704
Thanks.

09:09.005 --> 09:10.006
Later.

09:10.707 --> 09:11.708
Okay.

09:44.808 --> 09:46.807
Yeah, no shit.

10:20.443 --> 10:22.013
You're the worst.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.512
Teaching American literature is not fucked.

10:57.514 --> 10:59.413
When are you coming up?

10:59.415 --> 11:01.983
You want to teach poetry,
not a requirement class.

11:01.985 --> 11:06.321
You've been there for
three years. It's your time.

11:06.323 --> 11:08.726
I just don't know why you're not furious.

11:11.562 --> 11:13.795
When are you coming up?

11:13.797 --> 11:17.599
I found a place in Woodstock that
does wood-fired pizzas in an orchard.

11:17.601 --> 11:19.066
<i>We have Jerry's
opening this weekend.</i>

11:19.068 --> 11:21.936
Oh, no, I can't.

11:21.938 --> 11:26.276
I'm on a new health kick where I'm
cutting back on suicidal feelings.

11:28.411 --> 11:32.980
All right, I'll tell him you're
upstate on a writing retreat.

11:32.982 --> 11:34.584
Which I am.

11:37.788 --> 11:40.157
Oh. My drinks are here.

11:40.957 --> 11:43.191
Get up here, lady.

11:43.193 --> 11:44.227
Okay, bye.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.893
Bye.

11:49.533 --> 11:50.534
Yeah?

11:54.504 --> 11:57.104
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:57.106 --> 12:00.274
Here, contraband. Don't tell.

12:00.276 --> 12:02.677
It was thusly their relationship began

12:02.679 --> 12:04.914
with a seemingly harmless secret.

12:06.616 --> 12:09.082
So, you're ahead of the game.

12:09.084 --> 12:11.518
- What game is that?
- Thesis.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.689
Most of my students
don't start till the fall.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.757
Well, I'm here and I'm working at Neon,

12:15.759 --> 12:18.325
so it'd be nice to be thinking
about something whilst I'm...

12:20.364 --> 12:22.864
Robotically pushing a child on a swing?

12:22.866 --> 12:24.398
Using the meat slicer.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.402
Oh, those things are scary.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.537
So, what are you thinking?

12:29.539 --> 12:30.640
Right now?

12:32.042 --> 12:34.676
Yeah, with regard to your thesis.

12:34.678 --> 12:37.313
I want to write a series
of poems about grief.

12:43.654 --> 12:44.822
That's great.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.827
Um, I should tell you that

12:52.062 --> 12:54.229
the creative thesis is a beast.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.431
Have you considered researching
the history of grief poetry?

12:57.433 --> 12:59.667
I think that you should do that,

12:59.669 --> 13:02.903
not only for your own
edification, but also because

13:02.905 --> 13:06.242
the review committee really eats
it up with a fork and a spoon.

13:09.246 --> 13:14.715
"Who is the third who
walks always beside you?

13:14.717 --> 13:18.186
"When I count, there are
always you and I together

13:18.188 --> 13:20.857
"But when I look ahead up the white road

13:22.558 --> 13:27.061
"There is always another
one walking beside you

13:27.063 --> 13:33.869
"Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded

13:33.871 --> 13:37.271
"I do not know whether a man or a woman

13:37.273 --> 13:41.810
"But who is that on the other side of you?

13:41.812 --> 13:44.448
"What is that sound high in the air?"

13:46.683 --> 13:49.385
T.S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land.</i>

13:53.155 --> 13:56.327
He loses his goddamn mind in that poem.

13:59.663 --> 14:02.933
Yeah, I should go forth
and learn about all of that.

14:05.669 --> 14:07.969
Yeah, I think if you do that,

14:07.971 --> 14:11.840
that this could be a
really important project,

14:11.842 --> 14:14.609
and I sure as hell would
like to help you out.

14:14.611 --> 14:16.945
- Okay.
- Cool.

14:16.947 --> 14:21.181
So... Yeah, so whenever you want to start.

14:21.183 --> 14:23.118
I'll email you.

14:23.120 --> 14:27.358
- Thank you, Professor McCann.
- Yeah, no problem, anytime.

14:33.429 --> 14:37.130
So, Iris, drinking alone?

14:37.132 --> 14:38.868
You could've called a brother.

14:42.105 --> 14:44.504
Oh, this is stupid.

14:44.506 --> 14:47.141
If I had a brain, I know
this would be ill-advised.

14:47.143 --> 14:50.314
It's the only cure. I've got
four older brothers, trust me.

14:54.016 --> 14:55.419
I'm an asshole.

15:04.961 --> 15:06.130
Ugh!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.303
Oh, yeah!

15:13.903 --> 15:15.402
We're high!

15:19.009 --> 15:20.307
It's coming up!

15:20.309 --> 15:23.311
You guys want tomatoes or lettuce?

15:27.283 --> 15:29.550
You guys notice this guy over
here just having a snack...

15:49.038 --> 15:51.008
Whoa!

15:55.379 --> 15:57.445
You should come back for dinner!

16:06.856 --> 16:09.590
Hello! Does anybody even work here?

16:09.592 --> 16:11.057
Oh, we've gotta go.

16:11.059 --> 16:13.393
Oh, fuck!

16:13.395 --> 16:16.332
Fuck! Let's go! Shit.

16:17.534 --> 16:19.803
That's for you, sir.

16:23.874 --> 16:25.540
Hi, Iris.

16:25.542 --> 16:27.575
Professor McCann, hi.

16:27.577 --> 16:31.211
Um, how's the Forest?

16:31.213 --> 16:33.915
Uh, the Forest is better
than you would think.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.749
Um, I mean, it doesn't look great,

16:35.751 --> 16:38.518
but it's what is inside that makes it hot.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.522
What, it's spicy?

16:40.222 --> 16:41.391
What? No.

16:43.525 --> 16:44.794
Um...

16:48.231 --> 16:49.633
Hey, Iris.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.169
You remember that thing that
we were just talking about?

16:54.404 --> 16:56.870
Yeah. Yes, I, um... Mmm-hmm.

16:56.872 --> 16:58.973
- Yeah. What do you think about that?
- I...

16:58.975 --> 17:01.909
I... You know, um...

17:01.911 --> 17:03.913
Yeah, 'cause that's not
what you just said before.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.813
What?

17:11.820 --> 17:13.921
I'm sorry. I'm embarrassed.

17:13.923 --> 17:16.457
Hey, what are you making me?

17:16.459 --> 17:18.326
I don't know. What do you want?

17:18.328 --> 17:20.127
First, turkey.

17:20.128 --> 17:21.963
Oh, yeah. Um...

17:21.964 --> 17:24.196
Wait, wait. I take that back.

17:24.199 --> 17:26.400
I don't want you anywhere near
that industrial slicing machine.

17:28.204 --> 17:29.773
Oh, shit.

18:39.242 --> 18:41.141
<i>Yes!</i>

18:41.143 --> 18:42.142
Are you sure we're
going to the right place?

18:42.144 --> 18:43.610
Yes, it's this way.

18:43.612 --> 18:45.513
No, I'm serious, Mae. Look at me. Come on.

18:45.515 --> 18:46.982
Look at this!

18:46.984 --> 18:48.683
Whoo!

18:48.685 --> 18:50.320
Come on, Catherine!

19:23.085 --> 19:24.487
Isn't it beautiful?

19:32.661 --> 19:33.697
Iris.

19:40.102 --> 19:42.270
It is I.

19:42.272 --> 19:44.207
Adviser of the thesis.

19:54.784 --> 19:57.118
Does this happen to you frequently?

19:57.120 --> 19:59.521
It's happened before, yeah.

19:59.523 --> 20:01.225
You should see a doctor.

20:04.360 --> 20:05.462
Um...

20:06.830 --> 20:09.265
You can sleep here on the couch.

20:11.301 --> 20:13.270
Or I can drive you home.

20:19.109 --> 20:23.080
Or I can call you a cab.
I'm upstairs. So you can...

20:24.980 --> 20:27.383
You know, whatever, whatever you decide.

20:29.986 --> 20:31.121
Um...

20:34.457 --> 20:35.659
I'll be right back.

20:52.609 --> 20:54.611
Okay, just a little bit.

21:02.185 --> 21:03.186
Okay.

21:17.266 --> 21:19.333
So, why are you home for the summer

21:19.335 --> 21:23.603
instead of doing one of those
feed-the-homeless internships?

21:23.605 --> 21:25.107
I don't wanna talk.

21:51.199 --> 21:52.367
What's wrong? Are you okay?

21:52.369 --> 21:54.371
Sorry, it's a loud door.

22:14.189 --> 22:20.328
I'm here this summer because I
was in a car accident in March.

22:20.330 --> 22:23.900
I'm here to be with my friend,
Catherine. She was the one driving.

22:25.066 --> 22:27.436
Our best friend Mae, she was

22:29.773 --> 22:31.408
killed in the crash.

22:33.109 --> 22:35.145
She was in the passenger seat.

22:38.014 --> 22:40.583
I don't know how to live like this.

22:42.083 --> 22:43.818
I don't know...

22:43.820 --> 22:46.556
I can't get my head around it,

22:47.622 --> 22:49.124
and I can't accept it.

22:49.126 --> 22:51.324
It just makes no sense.

22:51.326 --> 22:52.428
Mmm.

22:53.829 --> 22:54.931
It doesn't.

23:12.948 --> 23:16.119
I'm here because I
thought I could tell you.

23:25.227 --> 23:26.462
You can.

25:19.775 --> 25:21.175
Hey!

25:21.177 --> 25:24.177
- Can I just get some cheese?
- What?

25:24.179 --> 25:25.779
You want bread with that?

25:25.781 --> 25:27.747
Yeah, only if I can get
it in between the cheese.

25:27.749 --> 25:30.216
I'd like to invert the typical
roles of sandwich ingredients,

25:30.218 --> 25:32.820
thereby casting a
spotlight on the stagnancy

25:32.822 --> 25:35.789
which has come to characterize
the American lunch.

25:35.791 --> 25:38.125
Yeah, we have that. It's called the Tool.

25:38.127 --> 25:40.060
Sweet. Awesome.

25:40.062 --> 25:42.295
Hey, so guess what?

25:42.297 --> 25:44.764
This evening, I'm gonna
have a special screening

25:44.766 --> 25:46.233
of <i>Silent Night, Deadly Night.</i>

25:46.235 --> 25:47.568
Oh.

25:47.570 --> 25:50.103
Hey, Santa's a psychosexual killer.

25:50.105 --> 25:51.638
- Tuna on white.
- Huh?

25:51.640 --> 25:52.775
Thank you.

25:55.011 --> 25:56.644
That guy your boyfriend?

25:56.646 --> 25:58.114
No, he's my roommate.

25:59.215 --> 26:01.115
- Hi.
- Hey.

26:01.117 --> 26:03.954
Uh, I'd like a roast beef on
white with tomato and mayo.

26:06.322 --> 26:07.290
Hi, Iris.

26:09.225 --> 26:10.293
Hi, Gerald.

26:12.160 --> 26:13.563
Here you go, lover.

26:14.463 --> 26:15.498
Enjoy.

26:18.700 --> 26:20.801
<i>I can't come up.</i>

26:20.803 --> 26:24.571
What? Why? No, no, no.

26:24.573 --> 26:27.340
I told you about that memoir
I bought, from the Navajo girl?

26:27.342 --> 26:31.579
Remember, the pageant on the reservation?

26:31.581 --> 26:34.747
Yeah, I was literally one hour
away from the first pre-release,

26:34.749 --> 26:38.218
and I find out she's
an Orange County Korean,

26:38.220 --> 26:39.954
headed to Penn.

26:39.956 --> 26:42.022
Wow.

26:42.024 --> 26:45.560
<i>Teenage girls are fucking batshit.</i>

26:45.562 --> 26:48.098
Well, can't you just make it fiction?

26:49.165 --> 26:51.465
That's so disgusting.

26:51.467 --> 26:53.065
That's what I'm doing tonight,

26:53.067 --> 26:55.202
rewriting all the press
releases, blah, blah, blah.

26:55.204 --> 26:56.469
How's your writing going?

26:56.471 --> 26:59.372
What, you want a word count?

26:59.374 --> 27:01.844
I should go. I have a
long night ahead of me.

27:02.512 --> 27:03.513
Bye.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.015
Bye.

27:11.086 --> 27:12.421
Don't.

27:20.329 --> 27:21.995
I'll call you tomorrow morning.

27:21.997 --> 27:24.263
Don't stay out too late.

27:24.265 --> 27:26.466
And if their lawyer calls,
you do not talk to him, okay?

27:26.468 --> 27:29.168
I mean it. Catherine, this is serious.

27:29.170 --> 27:31.237
You know what? Maybe we shouldn't go.

27:31.239 --> 27:33.706
What? No. Oh, my God, Dad, go.

27:33.708 --> 27:36.543
It's... I won't talk to anyone.

27:36.545 --> 27:37.980
I'll be with Mae.

27:39.982 --> 27:41.581
Iris.

27:41.583 --> 27:42.619
I'll be fine.

28:55.457 --> 28:56.790
Jesus.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.695
- Hi.
- Hi, Jack.

29:00.396 --> 29:01.696
How are you?

29:01.698 --> 29:04.467
Uh, good. Good, good. Good.

29:05.633 --> 29:06.867
Have you seen Iris?

29:06.869 --> 29:08.534
Uh, Iris? Yeah, she just left.

29:08.536 --> 29:11.138
She went to have dinner
at her thesis advisor's.

29:11.140 --> 29:12.738
Dinner? Oh.

29:12.740 --> 29:14.741
Well, you know, she was
wearing a very small skirt,

29:14.743 --> 29:17.444
and she took a really long shower.

29:17.446 --> 29:20.247
Oh? Was it a suede skirt?

29:20.249 --> 29:21.581
Uh-huh.

29:21.583 --> 29:23.650
You know that's her "fuck me" skirt?

29:23.652 --> 29:25.418
Interesting.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.989
Yeah.

29:28.957 --> 29:30.159
Um...

29:31.561 --> 29:34.061
Is that your boyfriend?

29:34.063 --> 29:37.230
Well, that's Che Guevara. And I'm not gay.

29:37.232 --> 29:40.837
And if I were, it wouldn't
be with a man in a beret.

29:41.503 --> 29:42.539
Nice.

29:44.006 --> 29:45.305
Uh...

29:45.307 --> 29:47.342
Sorry, uh, what are you doing now?

29:48.444 --> 29:50.977
I don't know.

29:50.979 --> 29:53.515
Um, it's nice seeing you.

29:55.918 --> 29:57.152
See you.

30:10.432 --> 30:11.700
Hang on!

30:13.969 --> 30:15.369
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:15.371 --> 30:17.271
- How you doing?
- Good.

30:17.273 --> 30:18.738
- Come on in.
- How are you?

30:18.740 --> 30:20.008
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

30:21.310 --> 30:23.580
Sorry it's so hot in here.

30:25.180 --> 30:27.316
I'm sweating like a pig.

30:30.319 --> 30:32.686
Um, ice cream.

30:32.688 --> 30:34.420
You're a gentleman.

30:34.422 --> 30:36.991
I mean, I get it for free,

30:36.993 --> 30:39.792
in the sense I just steal it from work.

30:39.794 --> 30:43.164
I hope you believe as I do that, as
Americans, we're obliged to consume

30:43.166 --> 30:47.600
mass amounts of unusable
carbohydrates that numb our brains

30:47.602 --> 30:51.105
and make us better television
watchers, 'cause I'm making pasta.

30:51.107 --> 30:52.539
Mmm.

30:52.541 --> 30:53.710
Food of my people.

30:55.076 --> 30:56.909
You look Irish.

30:56.911 --> 30:58.581
I also look innocent.

31:19.067 --> 31:20.300
What can I get you?

31:20.302 --> 31:22.034
- Can I have a vodka soda?
- Sure.

31:22.036 --> 31:24.705
And can I order something,
a drink for someone?

31:24.707 --> 31:26.173
Absolutely.

31:26.175 --> 31:28.077
The guy with the blue hat.

31:29.244 --> 31:31.778
- Whatever he drinks.
- Okay.

31:31.780 --> 31:32.782
Thanks.

31:35.484 --> 31:37.352
- Yo, Billy.
- Yeah?

31:52.334 --> 31:54.001
Just take it.

31:54.003 --> 31:56.936
All right, look, you need to leave.

31:56.938 --> 31:58.640
Can I just talk to you?

32:18.561 --> 32:21.528
I don't even want to publish
another book, you know.

32:21.530 --> 32:23.731
I mean, nobody needs some
white guy with poor vision

32:23.733 --> 32:25.433
and an Ivy League degree
getting all the luck.

32:25.435 --> 32:27.868
Some kid in a rundown mobile
home might not have a chance.

32:27.870 --> 32:30.003
I can't let that happen.

32:30.005 --> 32:32.775
So I'm just gonna stagnate.

32:36.111 --> 32:37.580
I loved your books.

32:38.714 --> 32:39.916
Yeah, thanks.

33:01.035 --> 33:03.305
No, no, no, I'm okay.

33:16.618 --> 33:18.717
So, you like the Polish poets?

33:18.719 --> 33:21.388
- Is that what your work is like?
- Yes.

33:21.390 --> 33:26.760
The intersection of poetic
lyricism and existential darkness?

33:26.762 --> 33:27.730
Yes.

33:39.507 --> 33:41.009
What are you doing?

34:18.213 --> 34:19.512
Mmm, no.

34:19.514 --> 34:21.382
Yeah, good idea. Good idea.

34:24.119 --> 34:25.920
Good idea.

34:32.226 --> 34:33.529
How old are you?

34:35.898 --> 34:36.931
Forty.

35:40.930 --> 35:42.961
I'll be right back.

35:42.963 --> 35:45.164
- Okay.
- Okay?

35:45.166 --> 35:46.802
Okay, just a sec.

36:03.718 --> 36:04.854
A-ha!

36:05.653 --> 36:06.688
Found you.

36:48.296 --> 36:49.265
Hi.

36:52.467 --> 36:53.436
Hi.

37:23.831 --> 37:24.799
Hey.

37:26.769 --> 37:28.070
Beauty.

38:18.220 --> 38:20.923
Can I just say this? I don't...

38:22.590 --> 38:25.694
I wish it were me instead of Mae. I...

38:27.329 --> 38:30.700
I can't sleep without dreaming of her.

38:32.534 --> 38:35.803
I don't deserve to be here. I wish I...

38:35.805 --> 38:42.408
I wish I could've swung the car
around so it were me instead of her.

38:42.410 --> 38:45.345
You know I wasn't drunk. I
wasn't high. It just happened.

38:45.347 --> 38:46.912
It was just a bad turn.

38:46.914 --> 38:49.485
Hey, you know, my parents...

38:52.753 --> 38:56.057
My sister is gone.

38:57.325 --> 38:58.725
- I know.
- All right?

38:58.727 --> 39:02.495
There's no fucking changing it for them.

39:02.497 --> 39:07.133
You have your whole life to get over this.

39:07.135 --> 39:10.372
- I swear to God I won't...
- Now get fuck away from me, Catherine.

39:27.155 --> 39:29.624
Get the fuck away from me!

39:49.410 --> 39:51.347
Stop. Stop. Stop.

40:15.671 --> 40:16.806
Come on.

42:35.142 --> 42:36.110
Hey.

42:52.860 --> 42:53.962
Hello.

42:56.497 --> 42:57.532
Hi.

43:06.974 --> 43:08.776
- Iris.
- What?

43:22.090 --> 43:23.459
I just like you.

43:25.693 --> 43:29.028
I like you, too. Okay?

43:35.936 --> 43:37.772
It feels good.

43:42.977 --> 43:45.648
You have to be quiet.

44:13.874 --> 44:14.909
Hey.

44:16.945 --> 44:19.314
I have to tell you something, I...

44:20.881 --> 44:22.217
I just...

44:24.218 --> 44:25.653
I can't keep it from you.

44:30.090 --> 44:32.091
You can tell me.

44:32.093 --> 44:35.063
I mean, you've been MIA,
so I know something's up.

44:39.034 --> 44:41.403
I'm seeing my thesis advisor.

44:43.303 --> 44:45.240
Seeing him?

44:46.907 --> 44:49.510
I slept with him. I'm sleeping with him.

44:50.579 --> 44:51.580
He's married.

44:53.648 --> 44:54.950
He's married?

44:56.351 --> 44:58.318
I mean, I know it's wrong.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.923
It's wrong and it's bad, and
it's all of those things but...

45:08.162 --> 45:09.995
It doesn't seem it.

45:09.997 --> 45:15.267
It's shocking because
it's just not you at all.

45:15.269 --> 45:16.271
I know.

45:21.943 --> 45:23.144
How was it?

45:25.512 --> 45:29.183
It was unbelievable. I
mean, it is unbelievable.

45:29.885 --> 45:31.216
It's amazing.

45:33.555 --> 45:35.524
Maybe his wife's a bitch.

45:50.204 --> 45:52.473
I just want the best for you.

45:53.474 --> 45:55.475
You know?

45:55.477 --> 45:59.381
I know, inevitably, you're
going to get hurt here.

46:06.019 --> 46:07.588
I'm already hurt.

46:08.689 --> 46:10.224
It can't get worse.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.928
I gotta shower.

46:14.930 --> 46:17.099
I'm going over to his place later.

46:18.900 --> 46:20.298
What's your plan?

46:20.300 --> 46:22.401
I thought we were hanging out.

46:22.403 --> 46:24.836
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.

46:24.838 --> 46:28.508
It's gonna be our summer?

46:28.510 --> 46:31.412
You and Professor Feely McGrabby?

46:32.447 --> 46:33.879
And me and me?

46:33.881 --> 46:35.684
No. No.

47:05.747 --> 47:08.648
- So, were you in the hospital?
- What?

47:08.650 --> 47:10.651
After the accident. Sorry, that was abrupt.

47:11.318 --> 47:12.852
Oh. Uh...

47:12.854 --> 47:14.056
It's okay.

47:16.189 --> 47:18.559
Uh, I had to have stitches, yeah.

47:19.561 --> 47:21.530
And, um, Catherine...

47:24.233 --> 47:27.901
They had her on suicide
watch for, like, a week.

47:27.903 --> 47:29.238
She tried to slit her wrists.

47:31.240 --> 47:34.874
She was just, like, clawing at herself.

47:34.876 --> 47:37.178
So they had her sedated
through the funeral.

47:40.046 --> 47:44.418
And she, uh, severed a tendon
in her calf in the accident.

47:46.021 --> 47:47.522
So, how's she doing now?

47:49.825 --> 47:51.093
I don't know.

47:51.860 --> 47:53.361
She in therapy?

47:56.097 --> 47:58.366
No, she says she doesn't need it.

47:59.601 --> 48:01.035
How about you?

48:04.305 --> 48:06.240
I've been feeling better lately.

48:22.389 --> 48:23.391
Hi.

48:43.577 --> 48:45.980
Oh, you're so hard.

48:49.217 --> 48:53.653
You know, that's just
like a throwaway line,

48:53.655 --> 48:55.921
but when you say it, I
know why it's a classic.

48:57.390 --> 48:58.693
Oh, my God.

49:00.327 --> 49:01.760
Oh. Oh!

49:01.762 --> 49:04.430
Babe, wait! You're
gonna make me come. Fuck!

49:04.432 --> 49:06.800
Jesus.

49:06.802 --> 49:08.637
That's another classic.

49:17.079 --> 49:19.514
- Shh, shh.
- I won't shh.

49:25.352 --> 49:26.785
Are you like this with all the boys?

49:26.787 --> 49:28.086
I was a virgin.

49:28.088 --> 49:29.856
Yeah, I can tell.

49:29.858 --> 49:31.791
I'm actually not like this at all.

50:02.222 --> 50:03.655
- This way.
- Wait.

50:03.657 --> 50:05.725
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop.

50:05.727 --> 50:07.392
What? What is that?

50:07.394 --> 50:08.995
Oh, please with the grabbing.

50:08.997 --> 50:11.263
I thought you said you're
not doing it anymore.

50:11.265 --> 50:13.099
I'm not.

50:15.336 --> 50:16.905
- No, I'm not.
- Guys!

50:17.838 --> 50:19.137
- To the pond.
- Yes.

50:19.139 --> 50:20.408
- It's gonna be beautiful!
- I know...

50:40.896 --> 50:42.930
Mmm, you have man hands.

50:44.131 --> 50:46.101
- That's what I ordered.
- Hmm.

50:49.970 --> 50:52.370
Hey, you want to meet my dad?

50:52.372 --> 50:54.307
I'm having lunch with
him on campus tomorrow.

50:54.309 --> 50:56.408
I thought I could bring him by.

50:56.410 --> 50:59.778
"Father, you remember how I told you

50:59.780 --> 51:02.613
"that I'm not a little girl anymore?"

51:02.615 --> 51:04.452
He's a nice guy.

51:10.691 --> 51:12.793
I'm not your boyfriend.

51:15.664 --> 51:18.900
A, it's been two weeks.

51:20.034 --> 51:22.403
B, I'm not your boyfriend.

51:23.704 --> 51:26.140
C, I'm a dirty, old man.

51:26.974 --> 51:28.075
And,

51:29.077 --> 51:31.079
D, my wife's coming up.

51:40.320 --> 51:44.923
She's gonna be here all weekend.
She comes up every weekend.

51:44.925 --> 51:47.461
Except the last three because of work.

51:48.695 --> 51:50.729
Fun.

51:50.731 --> 51:52.731
It's gonna be fun for all of us.

51:54.802 --> 51:56.170
Just a minute!

51:57.137 --> 51:58.172
Iris.

52:00.775 --> 52:02.941
I'm so fucked!

52:02.943 --> 52:05.477
There's this tool from Brown who's
had my book from interlibrary loan

52:05.479 --> 52:06.912
for three weeks.

52:06.914 --> 52:08.914
I think he's dead in his thesis carrel,

52:08.916 --> 52:10.485
the book under his decaying
ass, and I'll never get it back.

52:15.756 --> 52:17.359
Glad to see you.

52:18.925 --> 52:20.727
As heard.

52:20.729 --> 52:23.365
Gerald's wife is coming up this weekend.

52:26.133 --> 52:27.636
I'm an asshole.

52:29.702 --> 52:31.172
You're an asshole.

52:37.878 --> 52:40.481
It's only been, like, two weeks, but still.

52:41.883 --> 52:43.585
How long has he been married?

52:45.586 --> 52:47.621
We don't talk about it.

52:48.923 --> 52:50.823
It's not funny, Catherine.

52:50.825 --> 52:53.291
Let's just smoke weed all weekend.

52:53.293 --> 52:54.760
Okay. Do you have any?

52:54.762 --> 52:58.430
No, but I'm sure Jack does.

52:58.432 --> 53:00.899
I haven't spoken to him in, like, a week.

53:00.901 --> 53:04.202
Been staying at Professor FuckBuddy's.

53:04.204 --> 53:05.905
You look really skinny.

53:05.907 --> 53:08.874
Like, coke-skinny or meth?

53:08.876 --> 53:11.242
Those are my two choices?

53:11.244 --> 53:12.845
Boo!

53:12.847 --> 53:15.381
Just get me some weed.
I need to get my grub on.

53:15.383 --> 53:18.816
Why don't you just come in? It's gorgeous!

53:18.818 --> 53:20.952
No, I can't swim in this.

53:20.954 --> 53:22.489
Fuck if I care. Take it off.

53:24.791 --> 53:27.792
Do you care what I've been up to at all

53:27.794 --> 53:31.930
while you've been sleeping
with Professor Von Slurpy?

53:31.932 --> 53:34.101
Yeah. What?

53:36.671 --> 53:38.607
Professional escort work.

53:41.041 --> 53:43.978
I had a G-spot orgasm from being on top.

53:45.111 --> 53:46.345
Nice.

53:46.347 --> 53:47.847
Did you pee?

53:47.849 --> 53:49.048
Just now?

53:49.050 --> 53:51.850
No. When you came, hello?

53:51.852 --> 53:55.354
You know, sometimes
women, when they ejaculate,

53:55.356 --> 53:57.388
they think it's urine, but it's really not.

53:57.390 --> 53:58.658
It's just love potion.

53:58.660 --> 54:01.093
I don't know.

54:01.095 --> 54:03.863
I mean, I get, like, really wet,

54:03.865 --> 54:06.298
but it's not like a burst or anything.

54:06.300 --> 54:08.800
Oh, my God, you're, like, all sexed up.

54:08.802 --> 54:11.272
- It's insane. It's like you're possessed.
- Hmm.

54:12.139 --> 54:14.539
Possessed by Mae.

54:14.541 --> 54:16.975
One of us has gotta be the slut, right?

54:16.977 --> 54:19.914
Well, you're in lurve, so
it's not actually slutty.

54:25.352 --> 54:29.323
Is it good with Professor Von Slurpy?

54:30.356 --> 54:31.325
Yeah.

54:32.392 --> 54:33.360
Good.

54:35.729 --> 54:36.963
Come on, get in.

54:36.965 --> 54:39.934
No, I'm just gonna warm my soul.

54:41.936 --> 54:43.704
Ah, you're never coming in.

55:44.865 --> 55:46.601
- Yo!
- Hey.

55:47.468 --> 55:49.135
How was your sleep?

55:49.137 --> 55:50.702
- Fine.
- Yeah?

55:50.704 --> 55:52.706
- Yeah.
- I have the paper.

55:53.541 --> 55:55.006
Oh!

55:55.008 --> 55:56.910
Look at all these tag sales.

55:57.611 --> 55:58.644
Let's go.

55:58.646 --> 56:00.414
Look what I've got.

56:02.784 --> 56:04.651
Really? Like, right here, right now?

56:05.820 --> 56:07.986
Car pass. I don't want...

56:07.988 --> 56:10.756
Come on, Iris.

56:10.758 --> 56:12.925
'Cause I'm missing

56:12.927 --> 56:15.130
more than just your body.

56:17.932 --> 56:19.999
They eat the whole thing.

56:20.001 --> 56:22.300
Shit.

56:22.302 --> 56:24.303
Henry? Wait, who'd you kiss?

56:24.305 --> 56:26.338
Yeah, that was, like, my
first spot for make-out.

56:26.340 --> 56:28.340
Well, my first kiss.

56:28.342 --> 56:29.642
Oh, my God, so you're talking,
like, peck on the cheek.

56:34.916 --> 56:36.618
I'm getting so high.

56:39.787 --> 56:41.289
Perfect.

56:49.028 --> 56:50.629
God, Iris, come here.

56:50.631 --> 56:52.296
No.

56:52.298 --> 56:53.698
Oh, my God.

56:53.700 --> 56:56.334
I'm so sexually confused.

56:56.336 --> 57:00.071
- How much for this record?
- 20.

57:00.073 --> 57:01.840
- Too much, it's like...
- 15?

57:01.842 --> 57:03.508
Deal.

57:03.510 --> 57:05.376
This belongs to us now.

57:05.378 --> 57:08.079
This would make me throb.

57:10.385 --> 57:13.586
20th century Psoriasis...

57:13.588 --> 57:15.657
Sounds like something my dad would say.

57:17.992 --> 57:19.260
It's got a distinct aroma.

57:24.064 --> 57:26.398
Iris, this is my grandma, 1970s.

57:26.400 --> 57:28.867
It's fucking freaky.

57:28.869 --> 57:31.769
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

57:31.771 --> 57:32.907
That's Von Slurpy.

57:33.706 --> 57:35.207
What?

57:35.209 --> 57:36.511
Yeah, and missus.

57:41.081 --> 57:43.684
- Oh, my God. He's old.
- Let's go.

57:53.360 --> 57:54.593
Hey.

57:54.595 --> 57:55.660
Iris, hey.

57:55.662 --> 57:56.729
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:56.731 --> 57:58.564
- Hi. Good.
- How are you?

57:58.566 --> 57:59.965
Uh, Lisette, this is Iris.

57:59.967 --> 58:02.233
She's one of my students.

58:02.235 --> 58:04.505
I'm advising her on her thesis.

58:06.474 --> 58:08.907
- Catherine. Hi.
- Hi.

58:08.909 --> 58:10.778
Hey, nice to meet you.

58:12.780 --> 58:15.881
They, uh, grew up in
Ansbury, just right near here.

58:15.883 --> 58:18.316
Oh! Just such a wonderful place
to grow up. It's so beautiful.

58:18.318 --> 58:20.151
Yeah, it is.

58:20.153 --> 58:21.620
Gerald's a really great professor.

58:23.956 --> 58:25.957
You know, he's also a really good bowler.

58:25.959 --> 58:28.093
Uh... Stop.

58:28.095 --> 58:30.128
Where...

58:30.130 --> 58:32.497
I was looking for one of those
toasters that pop up, you know.

58:32.499 --> 58:34.432
Really?

58:34.434 --> 58:37.769
Yeah, you know, the timer things.

58:37.771 --> 58:39.838
I just gonna go look over
here and see if one's there.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.140
- Good to see you guys.
- Bye.

58:42.142 --> 58:44.242
Wow. I'm, like, really thirsty right now.

58:44.244 --> 58:45.410
Yeah, me, too.

58:45.412 --> 58:47.546
I know, it's hot as balls.

58:47.548 --> 58:49.213
Gerald was saying something
about the smog layer

58:49.215 --> 58:51.582
preventing the heat from escaping.

58:51.584 --> 58:54.084
That's fucked up.

58:54.086 --> 58:56.090
I'm dying to check out her linens.

58:57.825 --> 58:59.358
A box over there. It's
nice to meet you guys.

58:59.360 --> 59:00.894
Nice to meet you.

59:03.131 --> 59:04.365
I have to go over there.

59:20.113 --> 59:23.115
This is a hideously small town.

59:23.117 --> 59:24.218
Mmm.

59:27.188 --> 59:30.390
- You want a blowjob in the barn?
- That's not funny.

59:31.559 --> 59:32.727
It's a little funny.

59:35.329 --> 59:36.698
Hey, Gerald!

59:42.736 --> 59:45.970
- Hey, Catherine, we should go!
- Otherwise, we're gonna be...

59:45.972 --> 59:48.874
- Yeah, we're gonna be late for church!
- Yeah.

59:48.876 --> 59:50.041
Bye. Nice to meet you.

59:50.043 --> 59:51.245
- Bye.
- See you.

59:52.579 --> 59:55.148
- That was insane.
- I'm insane.

59:57.651 --> 59:59.316
Fuck, our record.

59:59.318 --> 01:00:00.554
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:09.189 --> 01:01:11.224
I feel dirty and naughty.

01:01:12.492 --> 01:01:14.161
In a bad way.

01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:18.562
Our relationship lives in a dark closet.

01:01:18.564 --> 01:01:20.568
It's like a poison mushroom.

01:01:23.503 --> 01:01:24.572
I'm sorry.

01:01:27.008 --> 01:01:29.110
Why can't we go out around here?

01:01:33.414 --> 01:01:35.082
In a non-touchy way?

01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:44.155
Are you 21?

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.292
Yeah.

01:01:56.436 --> 01:01:57.572
Shit!

01:01:59.606 --> 01:02:02.207
Hey, are you in line?

01:02:21.561 --> 01:02:22.630
Excuse me.

01:02:48.689 --> 01:02:51.055
Excuse me. I'm going.

01:02:51.057 --> 01:02:52.126
What?

01:02:55.494 --> 01:02:56.662
Wait! Iris!

01:02:56.664 --> 01:03:00.097
- No. No.
- Stop. Stop.

01:03:00.099 --> 01:03:03.901
- What are you doing with him?
- I don't know.

01:03:03.903 --> 01:03:06.171
Why would you be with
someone that hates you?

01:03:06.173 --> 01:03:07.773
It's fucked up!

01:03:07.775 --> 01:03:09.443
And you're so happy with me?

01:03:11.544 --> 01:03:13.812
You make it worse!

01:03:13.814 --> 01:03:16.948
- Why would you say that?
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:19.416
I'm doing exactly what you're doing, Iris.

01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:21.820
Not knowing what the fuck I'm doing!

01:03:21.822 --> 01:03:23.858
- Okay.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:03:26.193 --> 01:03:28.496
At least I know it's not love.

01:03:40.073 --> 01:03:41.673
Are you all right?

01:03:41.675 --> 01:03:43.010
What's going on?

01:03:48.816 --> 01:03:49.851
Let's just go.

01:04:39.265 --> 01:04:41.066
<i>I told him I love him.</i>

01:04:41.068 --> 01:04:42.466
- What? What?
- What?

01:04:42.468 --> 01:04:43.736
What did he say?

01:04:43.738 --> 01:04:46.470
It was so fucking beautiful.

01:04:46.472 --> 01:04:50.140
He said, "I love you"
back and it's so insane.

01:04:50.142 --> 01:04:53.113
Don't worry. I love you, too.

01:05:02.356 --> 01:05:04.792
Hey, we need to get out of the car, guys.

01:05:06.892 --> 01:05:08.228
Where's Mae?

01:05:09.463 --> 01:05:10.898
We got blood everywhere.

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.651
Come on. We have to go. Come on.

01:05:32.653 --> 01:05:34.486
- No.
- Come on, come on.

01:05:34.488 --> 01:05:36.421
We have to go, come on.

01:05:36.423 --> 01:05:37.490
Come on.

01:05:42.262 --> 01:05:43.963
Come on.

01:05:43.965 --> 01:05:47.131
I thought you were...

01:05:47.133 --> 01:05:50.671
I got you. I've got you, I've
got you. Come on. Come on.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:57.709
Stop.

01:05:57.711 --> 01:05:59.843
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:05:59.845 --> 01:06:01.178
Stop!

01:06:06.186 --> 01:06:08.019
Oh, my God.

01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:09.222
Oh, my God.

01:06:10.356 --> 01:06:11.856
Oh, my God.

01:06:11.858 --> 01:06:13.561
I was just driving.

01:06:15.729 --> 01:06:17.098
It was nothing.

01:06:21.434 --> 01:06:26.040
I just flicked the cigarette out my
window, and it just got away from me.

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:28.441
I'm sorry.

01:06:32.211 --> 01:06:33.514
I'm sorry.

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:37.717
Mmm.

01:06:39.986 --> 01:06:41.385
I'm sorry.

01:06:41.387 --> 01:06:42.523
Hey, hey.

01:07:19.825 --> 01:07:22.228
It's Sunday, we don't have
to be talking on the phone.

01:07:24.197 --> 01:07:25.198
Hello.

01:07:26.967 --> 01:07:28.535
It's the lawyer, Dan.

01:07:33.374 --> 01:07:35.006
Are you cold?

01:07:35.008 --> 01:07:36.274
What?

01:07:36.276 --> 01:07:37.278
Are you cold?

01:07:37.945 --> 01:07:38.946
No.

01:07:42.715 --> 01:07:44.115
Iris!

01:07:44.117 --> 01:07:45.119
Shit!

01:07:45.952 --> 01:07:47.720
Shit. Shit.

01:07:48.988 --> 01:07:49.956
Iris?

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:53.325
Jesus, Catherine!

01:07:53.327 --> 01:07:58.329
They're filing a civil suit. Mae's parents.

01:07:58.331 --> 01:08:00.367
They're suing me for wrongful death.

01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:05.238
Can they do that?

01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:08.141
Yeah.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:17.180
Hey, Lon, do you have
Harvey Faulkner's cell phone?

01:08:17.183 --> 01:08:18.881
One of my students is in legal trouble and

01:08:18.884 --> 01:08:20.551
I wanted her to talk to
him as soon as possible.

01:08:20.554 --> 01:08:22.118
Can you give me a call?

01:08:22.121 --> 01:08:23.124
All right.

01:08:24.022 --> 01:08:25.658
My lawyer is fine.

01:08:32.866 --> 01:08:35.100
He has a certain...

01:08:35.102 --> 01:08:37.836
They can't prove you did anything wrong.

01:08:37.837 --> 01:08:40.441
- I didn't.
- No, you didn't.

01:08:49.448 --> 01:08:51.349
They say Catherine recently confessed

01:08:51.350 --> 01:08:53.350
to averting her eyes from the road

01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:55.285
to toss a cigarette out the window,

01:08:55.287 --> 01:08:58.122
and that after that she
lost control of the car.

01:08:58.124 --> 01:09:01.493
That moment, hands leaving the wheel,

01:09:01.495 --> 01:09:04.694
that constitutes a failure
to pay attention to the road.

01:09:04.696 --> 01:09:06.263
That's negligence.

01:09:06.265 --> 01:09:08.399
Jesus, Catherine!

01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:10.037
You told someone that?

01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:25.385
Billy!

01:09:30.490 --> 01:09:32.358
Billy, please open up.

01:09:50.576 --> 01:09:52.743
You wanna talk about it?

01:09:52.745 --> 01:09:55.680
There's nothing to talk
about. What do you mean?

01:09:55.682 --> 01:09:57.582
Isn't this why we're here?

01:09:57.584 --> 01:09:59.253
So you can be out of the city,

01:10:00.853 --> 01:10:03.521
and watch the bra-less
coeds skip across the lawn

01:10:03.523 --> 01:10:07.792
and feel the stirrings of youth again.

01:10:07.794 --> 01:10:12.329
And if it isn't working, I just wonder
if there's something else going on.

01:10:12.331 --> 01:10:15.867
There's nothing going on. I am writing.

01:10:15.869 --> 01:10:18.035
How's the Navajo project?

01:10:18.037 --> 01:10:21.038
What was the upshot with Cy?

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:24.307
He said it needed revisions. It
wasn't extreme enough for fiction.

01:10:24.309 --> 01:10:26.578
- Oh, no.
- No, he was right.

01:10:26.580 --> 01:10:28.712
That's insane.

01:10:28.714 --> 01:10:32.550
I really thought that the pivot
that you made was totally brilliant.

01:10:32.552 --> 01:10:34.455
So, wait, you are writing?

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:36.590
Yeah.

01:10:37.756 --> 01:10:38.925
- So...
- Wow.

01:10:39.893 --> 01:10:40.928
Can I read it?

01:10:42.295 --> 01:10:43.430
No.

01:10:48.902 --> 01:10:50.671
Why do you need to read it?

01:10:51.737 --> 01:10:53.538
Because I like your work?

01:10:53.540 --> 01:10:54.808
No, you don't.

01:10:57.544 --> 01:11:01.645
I don't like your work? I love your work.

01:11:01.647 --> 01:11:04.815
No, you don't. You don't
believe I have anything to say.

01:11:04.817 --> 01:11:06.751
Anyway, that's not the
reason why you can't read it.

01:11:06.753 --> 01:11:10.157
You can't read it 'cause it's
too new. It's too fragile.

01:11:12.192 --> 01:11:13.260
"Fragile."

01:11:15.461 --> 01:11:17.863
Like a Faberge egg fragile?

01:11:17.865 --> 01:11:19.465
Yeah.

01:11:22.869 --> 01:11:25.072
There's ice cream places open.

01:11:26.272 --> 01:11:28.773
I can't.

01:11:28.775 --> 01:11:31.411
You want me to go out?
I'll get some and come back.

01:11:31.945 --> 01:11:32.979
Okay.

01:11:33.946 --> 01:11:35.315
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:37.678 --> 01:12:40.345
Just stay. You just got here.
You can't even stay the night?

01:12:40.347 --> 01:12:42.279
Since we're starting at 9:00,

01:12:42.281 --> 01:12:44.416
I don't want to get up at
6:00 and drive for three hours.

01:12:44.418 --> 01:12:46.516
What, you can't say,
"I'd give you Saturday,

01:12:46.518 --> 01:12:48.921
"but you'll never take my Sundays"?

01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:52.759
The summer isn't really going as planned.

01:12:54.827 --> 01:12:55.862
No.

01:12:59.765 --> 01:13:01.599
I gotta go.

01:13:01.601 --> 01:13:02.603
Hey.

01:13:06.705 --> 01:13:08.275
Drive carefully.

01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:42.340
Billy! Hey.

01:13:42.342 --> 01:13:45.609
- One second.
- What are you doing?

01:13:45.611 --> 01:13:48.712
Why would you make it seem like
she confessed something to you?

01:13:48.714 --> 01:13:50.148
She didn't. You took it out of context.

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:51.949
- Iris.
- No, it's not fair.

01:13:51.951 --> 01:13:54.318
You know...

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:58.989
Taking money from her parents is
not going to make this hurt less.

01:13:58.991 --> 01:14:00.624
It's not going to make it any better.

01:14:00.626 --> 01:14:03.227
- Yeah, it will. Yeah, it will.
- No, it won't!

01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:04.964
- It won't.
- Hey. One sec, Pa.

01:14:06.665 --> 01:14:09.566
Hey, you know, we still have
to, like, wake up every day

01:14:09.568 --> 01:14:12.236
and go to work like we're normal.

01:14:12.238 --> 01:14:13.971
No one expects you to be normal.

01:14:13.973 --> 01:14:16.507
You think I can just, like,
sit at home and cry all day?

01:14:16.509 --> 01:14:19.543
Iris, wake up.

01:14:19.545 --> 01:14:22.950
- It won't make it right.
- Oh, it's never going to be right, Iris.

01:14:24.817 --> 01:14:26.320
I'm not an idiot.

01:14:39.732 --> 01:14:42.234
I need to talk to her.

01:14:42.236 --> 01:14:45.235
Don't you think she
needs to talk to someone?

01:14:45.237 --> 01:14:49.640
<i>You girls should not be talking
until after the trial. Goodbye.</i>

01:15:26.112 --> 01:15:27.581
You're incredible.

01:15:30.482 --> 01:15:32.151
These are wonderful.

01:16:11.957 --> 01:16:13.059
I think...

01:16:16.228 --> 01:16:19.297
I'm not what you need.

01:16:19.299 --> 01:16:22.302
I think I know more about
what I need than you do.

01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:33.479
I love you.

01:16:44.389 --> 01:16:46.425
Do you know what this is?

01:16:49.528 --> 01:16:51.596
I don't.

01:16:51.598 --> 01:16:55.102
This is the moment right
before everything falls apart.

01:16:56.602 --> 01:16:58.802
I love you, but that doesn't matter.

01:16:58.804 --> 01:17:01.472
It's not Catherine's fault that
Mae died, but that doesn't matter.

01:17:01.474 --> 01:17:04.475
This is how it works.
Everything falls apart.

01:17:04.477 --> 01:17:07.177
And you just have to keep
walking and try not to fall down.

01:17:07.179 --> 01:17:09.883
- For as long as possible.
- Mmm-hmm. Don't say that.

01:17:12.184 --> 01:17:13.352
That's not it.

01:17:23.295 --> 01:17:24.664
I should go.

01:17:26.799 --> 01:17:29.635
You should be inside me and never leave.

01:17:31.970 --> 01:17:33.139
Whatever.

01:17:38.443 --> 01:17:41.279
I have hash and it's the
Little League final of Newburgh!

01:17:41.281 --> 01:17:42.480
Are you ready to weep...

01:17:42.482 --> 01:17:44.448
Sorry.

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:45.452
Professor McCann?

01:17:46.986 --> 01:17:48.388
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:49.622 --> 01:17:50.857
Um, I should get going.

01:17:52.525 --> 01:17:54.193
Thank you.

01:18:14.513 --> 01:18:16.615
What are you doing?

01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:19.251
I have

01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:21.788
brown nipples.

01:18:26.093 --> 01:18:30.597
You left that poem about
that stoned toddler...

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:33.900
You left it in a drawer.

01:18:36.201 --> 01:18:37.603
What are you doing?

01:18:40.071 --> 01:18:41.540
How do you mean?

01:18:55.588 --> 01:18:56.790
I don't know.

01:18:59.959 --> 01:19:02.129
What I'm doing.

01:19:04.363 --> 01:19:06.332
You know it's not about you.

01:19:09.634 --> 01:19:13.537
I hope you understand it's
not about you, Gerald McCann.

01:19:13.539 --> 01:19:17.874
For her. Tell me you
understand that on some level.

01:19:17.876 --> 01:19:21.145
She's experiencing a crisis
based on actual life and death,

01:19:21.147 --> 01:19:24.648
and you give her your dick as a present?

01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:27.754
Did you think it had
magical healing powers?

01:19:30.522 --> 01:19:31.724
It doesn't.

01:19:39.031 --> 01:19:40.564
Shit.

01:19:40.566 --> 01:19:41.601
Shit.

01:19:42.468 --> 01:19:43.470
Shit.

01:20:12.531 --> 01:20:14.567
You used to be original.

01:20:28.682 --> 01:20:29.715
I know.

01:20:35.655 --> 01:20:37.122
I fucking know.

01:21:29.842 --> 01:21:32.612
Uh, she found a poem
that I wrote about you.

01:21:33.545 --> 01:21:35.178
Oh...

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.314
And she came up last night.

01:21:37.316 --> 01:21:39.885
- What did she...
- She went back to the city.

01:21:45.657 --> 01:21:47.059
Can I read it?

01:21:48.561 --> 01:21:49.795
Yeah.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:59.102
So, I'm going to take this
next semester to go up to Maine.

01:21:59.104 --> 01:22:03.309
My parents are moving out of our old
house and they wanted my help, so...

01:22:05.745 --> 01:22:09.782
And I need to regroup.

01:22:12.151 --> 01:22:13.586
'Cause of me?

01:22:17.255 --> 01:22:18.657
Because of me.

01:22:24.496 --> 01:22:26.765
I'd do it again in a second.

01:22:29.835 --> 01:22:32.336
I mean, not if it made it worse for you.

01:22:32.338 --> 01:22:35.275
I really hope I didn't
make it worse for you.

01:22:39.245 --> 01:22:43.547
Look, it's preposterous
for me to be offering you

01:22:43.549 --> 01:22:46.149
any kind of life advice, clearly.

01:22:46.151 --> 01:22:47.320
Clearly.

01:22:49.088 --> 01:22:50.189
But

01:22:51.456 --> 01:22:53.224
I know this.

01:22:53.226 --> 01:22:57.160
And this is a kind of prescription.

01:22:57.162 --> 01:22:59.931
Okay, and it works.

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:04.168
Um, these people wrote their
way out of where you are now.

01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:05.672
They came here first.

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:09.175
They figured it out.

01:23:10.442 --> 01:23:11.643
Um...

01:23:13.478 --> 01:23:17.082
So, Frost, Yeats, Dylan Thomas. Everything.

01:23:18.884 --> 01:23:22.886
Adam Zagajewski, "Praise
the mutilated world."

01:23:22.888 --> 01:23:29.060
Dickinson, "I measure every grief
I meet with narrow, probing eyes.

01:23:29.062 --> 01:23:33.233
"I wonder if it weighs like
mine, or has an easier size."

01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:39.005
Anyway, there's lots of others.

01:23:40.505 --> 01:23:42.541
You can hang onto that.

01:23:45.477 --> 01:23:46.912
And then, um...

01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:50.250
Send me what you write.

01:23:52.284 --> 01:23:54.219
And I'll do the same.

01:23:57.857 --> 01:23:58.925
Okay?

01:24:02.460 --> 01:24:03.429
Okay.

01:24:49.674 --> 01:24:54.677
They waited on the side of the
road for emergency services.

01:24:54.679 --> 01:24:56.747
They did not have phones,

01:24:56.749 --> 01:25:00.987
and they couldn't walk due to
their injuries, so they just waited.

01:25:02.522 --> 01:25:05.457
We know they waited for over an hour.

01:25:32.619 --> 01:25:35.188
Catherine, could you hand me the eggs?

01:25:41.494 --> 01:25:44.764
Catherine, will you hand
me some eggs, please?

01:26:07.286 --> 01:26:09.289
Jesus!

01:26:09.955 --> 01:26:11.087
Fuck!

01:26:11.089 --> 01:26:12.057
Jesus.

01:26:17.229 --> 01:26:19.963
What the fuck?

01:26:19.965 --> 01:26:22.032
I don't even know my own strength.

01:26:22.034 --> 01:26:23.467
Ha!

01:26:23.469 --> 01:26:25.772
Yeah, it's fucking hilarious.

01:26:26.406 --> 01:26:27.573
Stay there.

01:26:45.290 --> 01:26:48.359
Why do you look like misery?

01:26:48.361 --> 01:26:50.727
When there's so much to be happy about?

01:26:54.532 --> 01:26:56.535
It's over with Gerald.

01:26:58.170 --> 01:26:59.939
His wife found out.

01:27:02.008 --> 01:27:04.041
Did she walk in on you?

01:27:04.043 --> 01:27:06.946
No. But she knows it's me.

01:27:15.487 --> 01:27:17.423
Are you in love with him?

01:27:41.045 --> 01:27:42.514
I don't know.

01:27:53.259 --> 01:27:54.827
I couldn't...

01:27:56.528 --> 01:27:58.497
I couldn't even touch her.

01:28:01.433 --> 01:28:03.835
She was already gone, Catherine.

01:28:08.372 --> 01:28:10.576
I should have been with her.

01:28:13.045 --> 01:28:14.347
I should have...

01:28:15.714 --> 01:28:17.617
I should have stayed.

01:28:36.034 --> 01:28:39.203
I'm so sorry about your love.

01:28:39.205 --> 01:28:40.770
Where are you going?

01:28:40.772 --> 01:28:44.940
Just wanted to say that
we should go out tomorrow.

01:28:44.942 --> 01:28:46.044
Don't leave.

01:28:48.213 --> 01:28:51.351
It's the night before my Judgment Day.

01:28:53.085 --> 01:28:55.288
Let's live while we can.

01:28:56.254 --> 01:28:57.356
Catherine.

01:29:17.142 --> 01:29:18.641
Fuck off!

01:29:18.643 --> 01:29:20.443
What the fuck?

01:29:20.445 --> 01:29:23.180
The only true compass to
the morass of American life

01:29:23.182 --> 01:29:26.385
is to trust your own
personal set of ethics.

01:29:28.086 --> 01:29:29.688
He doesn't want to see you.

01:29:34.259 --> 01:29:36.693
- Hey.
- What?

01:29:36.695 --> 01:29:38.296
Bartender wants you.

01:29:44.902 --> 01:29:45.972
Stop!

01:29:49.442 --> 01:29:50.907
Yeah?

01:29:50.909 --> 01:29:52.810
We need for you and your friend to leave.

01:29:52.812 --> 01:29:54.477
Why? We didn't do anything wrong.

01:29:54.479 --> 01:29:56.012
Why? Because I have obligations

01:29:56.014 --> 01:29:58.418
to certain customers here, that's why.

01:29:59.985 --> 01:30:01.353
Oh, obligations?

01:30:02.821 --> 01:30:04.154
Okay.

01:30:04.156 --> 01:30:05.792
Nope. No.

01:30:06.991 --> 01:30:08.093
Billy?

01:30:09.228 --> 01:30:10.726
Listen, man. Uh-uh.

01:30:10.728 --> 01:30:12.662
Let me just speak to Billy for a second!

01:30:12.664 --> 01:30:14.663
Hey, what's going on?

01:30:14.665 --> 01:30:17.667
They want us to leave. Billy
has told them to make us leave.

01:30:17.669 --> 01:30:19.270
- And that's not okay.
- No.

01:30:19.272 --> 01:30:21.070
- Let's just leave, that's fine.
- No.

01:30:21.072 --> 01:30:22.238
- Whoa, Iris, come on.
- No.

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.640
Iris, get down!

01:30:23.642 --> 01:30:25.042
- No, come on! Iris! Iris!
- Get off my bar.

01:30:25.044 --> 01:30:26.642
Billy, look at me!

01:30:26.644 --> 01:30:27.977
Iris, get down!

01:30:27.979 --> 01:30:29.879
Fucking look at me!

01:30:29.881 --> 01:30:31.815
- Fuck you!
- Iris, hey, stop!

01:30:31.817 --> 01:30:35.718
Why aren't we just allowed to be here?

01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:39.221
Everyone else is allowed to be here!

01:30:39.223 --> 01:30:40.992
Explain it to me!

01:30:41.594 --> 01:30:43.060
Please!

01:30:43.062 --> 01:30:45.494
Please tell me why!

01:30:45.496 --> 01:30:47.329
I...

01:30:47.331 --> 01:30:49.535
It's not fucking fair!

01:30:51.336 --> 01:30:53.604
Let go of her!

01:30:53.606 --> 01:30:54.971
- Get off!
- Off my bar!

01:30:58.477 --> 01:30:59.943
You're hurting me!

01:30:59.945 --> 01:31:02.378
Fucking hurt... Ow!

01:32:01.673 --> 01:32:03.175
Are you okay, Iris?

01:32:03.942 --> 01:32:05.175
Yeah.

01:32:05.177 --> 01:32:06.843
We can take it slowly.

01:32:06.845 --> 01:32:10.182
- I'm okay.
- We're almost there.

01:33:12.544 --> 01:33:14.479
Wow, it's really warm.

01:33:17.182 --> 01:33:18.150
Hey.

01:33:20.619 --> 01:33:21.653
Hey.

01:33:25.223 --> 01:33:26.659
I just...

01:33:28.093 --> 01:33:29.161
Um...

01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:34.165
I...

01:33:41.406 --> 01:33:43.342
I miss you, Mae.

01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:54.320
The world isn't the same without you.

01:34:07.299 --> 01:34:11.068
You'll be happy to know that

01:34:11.070 --> 01:34:14.303
my parents said that if we lose,

01:34:14.305 --> 01:34:17.740
they'll have to pay the settlement

01:34:17.742 --> 01:34:19.210
and I'll have to get a job.

01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:26.184
Hopefully it involves some
polyester brand uniform.

01:34:36.393 --> 01:34:39.896
If you have any say in it,

01:34:39.898 --> 01:34:44.400
it'll involve horizontal stripes

01:34:44.402 --> 01:34:47.736
and the previous employee's body odor.

01:34:50.575 --> 01:34:51.911
Amen.

01:35:05.957 --> 01:35:07.526
I'm so sorry.

01:35:13.398 --> 01:35:15.534
I love you so much.

01:35:20.839 --> 01:35:23.109
We love you so much.
