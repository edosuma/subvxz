Thanks.

38:38.687 --> 38:40.256
Coming up, the 911 call

38:40.356 --> 38:43.293
that landed this don Juan
in jail.

38:43.393 --> 38:46.497
What do you say we get
this party started, huh?

38:46.597 --> 38:48.065
Mm.

38:48.165 --> 38:50.202
...southern California
of a serious scam.

38:50.302 --> 38:53.105
Foreigners are calling people,
posing as IRS officers.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.807
Take it
nice and slow.

38:54.907 --> 38:58.011
They tell their victims they
owe money to the government.

38:58.077 --> 39:01.315
Want it slow?

39:01.415 --> 39:03.117
Come here.

39:04.619 --> 39:06.754
What's down here?
...In just the last few days.

39:06.854 --> 39:11.060
Ohh.
One of them lost $17,000
when she bought...

39:11.160 --> 39:13.762
Why don't we let him come out
and play, huh?

39:13.862 --> 39:16.066
Slow.

39:16.166 --> 39:18.435
Oh, is that you want,
daddy?

39:18.535 --> 39:20.204
Oh.

39:20.304 --> 39:23.841
Investigators say they can't
do very much about it...

39:23.941 --> 39:26.511
Oh. [ Chuckles ]

39:26.611 --> 39:28.613
Man:
The ongoing police manhunt...
There you go, huh?

39:28.713 --> 39:30.816
...for escaped serial killer
raynard waits...

39:30.916 --> 39:32.618
About time.
...Turned hectic today

39:32.718 --> 39:35.056
when a police vehicle collided
with a bus and a parked car

39:35.122 --> 39:37.224
on a busy street in Hollywood.
I was beginning to think
you were shy.

39:37.324 --> 39:39.393
Slow.
The officer driving
that vehicle

39:39.493 --> 39:42.430
was responding to one of dozens
of tips police received today

39:42.530 --> 39:46.402
in response to
the $150,000 reward...

39:48.904 --> 39:50.507
to the arrest of the fugitive.

39:50.607 --> 39:53.810
Waits was arrested last week
on suspicion of murder

39:53.910 --> 39:56.747
when police discovered
a dead body in his work Van.

39:56.847 --> 39:58.149
[ Bone cracks ]

39:58.249 --> 39:59.785
He subsequently confessed
to murdering

39:59.885 --> 40:01.953
as many as seven young men
in the Hollywood area.

40:02.088 --> 40:03.289
[ Sighs, panting ]

40:03.389 --> 40:05.225
Waits also
claimed responsibility

40:05.325 --> 40:07.927
for the death of the boy
whose bones recently were found

40:08.027 --> 40:10.064
on a hillside in Laurel canyon.

40:10.164 --> 40:11.832
Two days ago,
while leading investigators

40:11.932 --> 40:15.036
to the remains of his alleged
victims, waits escaped,

40:15.137 --> 40:17.572
killing deputy
district attorney Luis Escobar

40:17.672 --> 40:21.577
and seriously wounding
an l.A.P.D. Detective.
