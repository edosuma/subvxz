WEBVTT

02:52.471 --> 02:55.341
So every morning,
I find shelley right here.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.344
As you can see, we have the spot
marked.

02:59.377 --> 03:02.814
That's because she's
always in the same spot,

03:02.848 --> 03:03.848
never different.

03:05.484 --> 03:07.820
She's always looking at the sky.

03:07.853 --> 03:10.256
I have no idea what she
could be looking at.

03:33.912 --> 03:34.912
Wake up, sweetie.

03:35.848 --> 03:36.848
Hey, wake up.

03:44.423 --> 03:46.292
Good morning, honey.

03:59.371 --> 04:00.640
How many bites?

04:01.840 --> 04:02.941
A few.

04:02.974 --> 04:05.343
I'll probably
try that new spray later,

04:05.377 --> 04:06.612
maybe put up the zapper.

04:19.057 --> 04:21.260
- Thanks.
- There you go.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.033
All right.

04:30.134 --> 04:34.606
So, sweetie, how long would
you say this has been going on?

04:34.639 --> 04:37.442
Two and a half years, two
months,

04:37.475 --> 04:38.978
three weeks, and one day.

04:39.011 --> 04:41.847
And before
that, did you ever have

04:41.879 --> 04:43.949
problems sleepwalking as a
child,

04:43.982 --> 04:46.519
or sleeping, for that matter?

04:46.552 --> 04:47.887
No, never.

04:47.920 --> 04:51.624
And what about in the family,
mom, dad,

04:51.656 --> 04:54.926
aunts, uncles, any of them
have any problems sleeping?

04:55.860 --> 04:56.762
Not that I can remember.

04:56.795 --> 04:59.365
What about the first time it
happened?

04:59.398 --> 05:02.868
You recall anything weird
or out of the ordinary?

05:02.901 --> 05:03.901
Not really.

05:05.437 --> 05:07.605
It was just after you
got out the hospital,

05:07.639 --> 05:08.675
maybe a week or so.

05:09.675 --> 05:12.077
I do remember the first
time I woke up outside.

05:14.879 --> 05:15.879
That was scary.

05:17.815 --> 05:19.818
It's not something that you just
forget.

05:26.091 --> 05:28.828
Make sure you take care of the
backyard.

05:38.937 --> 05:40.706
We are in the first days of
summer,

05:40.738 --> 05:43.041
and an elderly man is the latest
victim

05:43.074 --> 05:45.610
from complications due
to the livingstone virus,

05:45.644 --> 05:48.713
or lv, as commonly called,

05:48.747 --> 05:52.685
making him the 26th
reported case in the state.

05:52.718 --> 05:56.555
Despite its uptick in cases,
authorities have maintained

05:56.588 --> 05:59.692
that contacting the disease is
very rare,

05:59.725 --> 06:04.096
and developing encephalitis
from the virus, even rarer.

06:04.129 --> 06:06.031
Most who contract the disease
present

06:06.064 --> 06:09.701
only mild to no symptoms at all.

06:09.735 --> 06:13.038
Still, caution is
advised, as it is unclear

06:13.071 --> 06:14.807
why some individuals develop

06:14.839 --> 06:17.142
fatal complications from the
virus.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.564
What the hell you doing?

06:38.596 --> 06:40.432
Hopefully preventing mosquitoes.

06:41.098 --> 06:42.735
Hope you kept your receipt.

06:42.767 --> 06:45.170
Got good reviews online, so.

06:45.204 --> 06:46.906
I'm telling you, pissing in
the grass

06:46.939 --> 06:48.074
would do just the same.

06:49.475 --> 06:50.785
You don't wanna get bit, you
stay inside

06:50.809 --> 06:52.011
and you keep it cold.

06:53.211 --> 06:55.548
Going to the bank in the am.

06:55.581 --> 06:57.516
Be around eight to get the rent.

06:57.548 --> 06:58.850
I'll have it.

06:58.884 --> 06:59.884
That's good.

07:01.185 --> 07:03.025
Why your wife out here
so early in the morning?

07:03.055 --> 07:04.790
Exercise, I guess.

07:04.822 --> 07:06.625
Standing still is exercising?

07:06.658 --> 07:09.829
Past few days, I reckon,
standing right about there,

07:11.028 --> 07:13.165
looking kinda odd,
until you come fetch her

07:13.197 --> 07:14.641
with that odd-looking camera of
yours.

07:14.665 --> 07:15.901
Look, she sleepwalks.

07:15.934 --> 07:17.211
They ain't got no medicine for
that?

07:17.235 --> 07:19.637
We just don't understand
why she's doing-

07:19.670 --> 07:21.908
- contagious?
- No, god, no.

07:22.875 --> 07:23.742
It's just-

07:23.774 --> 07:25.877
- one of those head things.

07:25.911 --> 07:26.911
I got you.

07:28.045 --> 07:30.882
Do me a favor, you keep that
over here,

07:31.916 --> 07:33.585
'cause I ain't got no problem
keeping

07:33.619 --> 07:36.088
this place empty, got me?

07:36.120 --> 07:38.823
Yeah, I got you.

07:38.857 --> 07:39.857
That's good.

07:40.925 --> 07:41.925
Be here in the am.

07:46.531 --> 07:48.766
I don't think
this needs to be in the video.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.735
It feels private.

07:50.769 --> 07:52.204
I want it in there.

07:52.237 --> 07:54.640
Hey, babe, why
don't you let me do it?

07:58.142 --> 07:59.142
I got it.

08:00.778 --> 08:03.983
There's just this
little voice inside my head

08:04.016 --> 08:06.252
keeps telling me that this
is just a waste of money.

08:08.153 --> 08:10.022
But we gotta keep trying, right?

08:11.889 --> 08:14.060
No one said that making
a baby would be easy.

08:19.798 --> 08:22.100
So I have cameras all over the
house.

08:23.999 --> 08:25.103
Different points of views,

08:25.137 --> 08:29.274
for both inside and out.

08:29.307 --> 08:31.276
So hopefully I won't miss
anything,

08:31.310 --> 08:36.315
which means you guys watching
won't miss anything, either.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.983
Our hope is that somebody out
there

08:39.017 --> 08:42.621
will see these videos,
and maybe reach out to us.

08:42.653 --> 08:46.558
I mean, we can't be the only
ones going through this.

08:46.591 --> 08:50.129
So, if you're out there,
please, let us know.

08:50.162 --> 08:54.133
Maybe we can help each
other, swap some ideas,

08:54.166 --> 08:56.235
hopefully figure this thing out.

08:56.268 --> 09:01.040
Anyways, until then, this
is married to a sleepwalker,

09:01.072 --> 09:02.073
signing off.

09:04.342 --> 09:06.578
Are you almost done?

09:06.611 --> 09:09.280
Yeah, babe, give me just a
minute.

09:09.313 --> 09:10.649
Well, I'm ready.

09:10.682 --> 09:13.318
Ready, ready for what, oh.

09:15.019 --> 09:16.019
Ready for that.

09:18.356 --> 09:20.725
Maybe not share everything.

09:25.864 --> 09:28.033
So I have to
sleep on top of this thing?

09:28.066 --> 09:29.167
Exactly.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.071
So, when you get up, hopefully
the alarm will go off,

09:32.104 --> 09:34.740
and that'll be enough to jolt
you awake.

09:34.773 --> 09:37.176
Hey, at least keep you from
spending

09:37.208 --> 09:39.210
the night outside for a change.

09:39.244 --> 09:40.379
That would be great.

09:40.412 --> 09:42.915
No more rainwater in my mouth.

09:42.947 --> 09:45.083
Why didn't we think about this
sooner?

09:45.116 --> 09:46.918
Actually, we didn't.

09:46.951 --> 09:50.121
Somebody who saw the first
video online suggested it.

09:50.154 --> 09:54.192
A Mr. Goldfish-super-fan-97.

09:55.126 --> 09:57.395
The power of social media.

09:57.428 --> 10:00.665
Well, thank you, Mr.
Goldfish-super-fan-97!

10:36.835 --> 10:37.903
Shelly?

10:48.879 --> 10:51.182
Thanks, Mr. Goldfish-super-fan.

12:06.124 --> 12:08.360
Are you sure
that's coming from me?

12:08.393 --> 12:09.495
I'm positive.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.467
I don't even think that
I could recreate that.

12:17.969 --> 12:21.006
I'll try.

12:23.107 --> 12:24.843
Okay, that wasn't even close.

12:29.581 --> 12:31.450
I can't even do that.

12:31.482 --> 12:33.151
I heard it with my own ears.

12:33.184 --> 12:35.353
It's right there on the monitor.

12:36.955 --> 12:39.925
Well, put it back from
when I first walked outside.

12:52.470 --> 12:54.273
Why did I turn around right
there?

12:55.874 --> 12:57.243
Your guess is as good as mine.

13:00.245 --> 13:01.547
Is your hand okay?

13:01.580 --> 13:03.215
Yeah, it's fine.

13:03.248 --> 13:07.119
So, look, I was thinking,
maybe we should share

13:07.152 --> 13:08.420
this with Dr. Lopez.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.557
Why, he's just gonna
say that sleepwalkers

13:11.590 --> 13:14.225
do weird shit, and he's gonna
overcharge us for our time.

13:14.259 --> 13:16.128
Okay, so let's get a new doctor.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.061
No.

13:17.095 --> 13:18.297
Why not?

13:18.330 --> 13:19.370
You know I don't like him,

13:19.397 --> 13:21.366
and, obviously, you don't like
him.

13:21.399 --> 13:24.235
What are you trying to say,
you having second thoughts?

13:24.269 --> 13:25.470
No, no.

13:25.503 --> 13:26.503
No, of course not.

13:27.605 --> 13:31.275
This is as much my idea
as it is yours, right?

13:31.308 --> 13:33.144
I mean, if it wasn't for the
cameras,

13:33.177 --> 13:35.213
we wouldn't know half of what's
going on.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.850
I need to know what happens
if this doesn't work

13:38.884 --> 13:42.053
or if things continue to get
worse.

13:42.086 --> 13:43.422
It's gonna work.

13:43.455 --> 13:45.624
Of course it is.

13:45.657 --> 13:47.293
What if we don't find anything?

13:48.592 --> 13:51.963
Well, then, I guess
we will just have plenty

13:51.996 --> 13:54.032
to show Dr. Lopez, okay?

13:55.933 --> 13:57.068
Okay, let's go to work.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.212
Dr. Lopez is an ass.

14:09.914 --> 14:14.185
Neurological disorders,
seizures, some fertility drugs,

14:15.320 --> 14:18.290
any number of medical issues
can cause sleepwalking,

14:18.322 --> 14:21.326
but I don't think that's the
case here.

14:21.359 --> 14:24.062
I think we're dealing with
anxiety, pure and simple.

14:24.095 --> 14:27.132
Shelly's sleepwalking begins
and ends with her husband.

14:27.164 --> 14:29.333
He almost died from the lv, but
I think

14:29.366 --> 14:31.068
it's Shelly who hasn't
recovered.

14:31.101 --> 14:34.206
I was the second in the
state to survive complications.

14:34.239 --> 14:38.442
At my worst, the doctors
gave me a 10% chance.

14:38.475 --> 14:41.078
I don't think I would've made
it if it wasn't for Shelly.

14:41.111 --> 14:43.481
I think we're dealing with
anxiety, pure and simple,

14:43.514 --> 14:47.218
because, let's look at the
facts, she lost a child,

14:47.251 --> 14:50.688
she almost lost her
husband, financial trouble,

14:50.721 --> 14:52.658
the stress of the condition
itself.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.426
That can take a toll on any
person,

14:54.458 --> 14:56.527
and I think we're dealing
with all of the above.

14:56.561 --> 15:00.232
My recommendation is that
Shelly get psychiatric care,

15:00.264 --> 15:04.468
but it's important to remember
that this is not a quick fix.

15:04.501 --> 15:07.572
Shelly was a month pregnant
when the sleepwalking started.

15:07.605 --> 15:11.442
She lost the child on the second
morning.

15:11.475 --> 15:14.145
We've been trying to
get pregnant ever since.

15:14.178 --> 15:18.650
This illness has cost
us our money, our house.

15:19.551 --> 15:21.219
It's cost us everything.

15:21.251 --> 15:24.021
I don't like videoing our lives,

15:24.054 --> 15:27.291
but I feel like it's the
only way to somehow find

15:27.325 --> 15:30.296
a way to get back the
life we should have had.

16:21.379 --> 16:24.182
Hey, Shelly, come check this
out.

16:26.350 --> 16:28.019
What you got?

16:28.052 --> 16:30.389
What do you think that is,
right there?

16:30.422 --> 16:32.124
What am I looking for?

16:33.357 --> 16:36.060
You don't see that person?

16:37.195 --> 16:38.129
Right there in the background.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.597
No, I don't see it.

16:40.731 --> 16:42.266
Come on.

16:42.299 --> 16:44.345
I mean, don't you think if
someone was standing there

16:44.369 --> 16:46.571
that we would've noticed?

16:46.604 --> 16:49.341
And, if that is a person,
then I feel really sorry

16:49.374 --> 16:51.217
for them that they don't
have something better to do.

16:51.241 --> 16:52.410
Maybe it's Mr. Cate.

16:53.845 --> 16:56.382
Now that's actually a scary
thought.

17:03.153 --> 17:04.823
Okay, is that how this is gonna
go,

17:04.855 --> 17:07.026
from now on we let the Internet
decide?

17:07.724 --> 17:11.629
Hey, apparently, now
every important decision

17:11.663 --> 17:13.231
is decided on the Internet.

17:14.164 --> 17:17.201
Well, good luck with that.

17:17.234 --> 17:18.402
All right, babe.

17:18.435 --> 17:19.403
I am gonna go take a shower,
and then I'm going to bed.

17:19.436 --> 17:21.639
All right, I'm gonna
come set everything up

17:21.673 --> 17:23.275
after I check the email, okay?

17:27.412 --> 17:29.280
"Another bullshit video."

17:29.314 --> 17:31.083
Yeah, thank you.

17:32.584 --> 17:33.584
Next.

17:34.486 --> 17:35.320
Carol b.

17:35.354 --> 17:38.657
Carol, "why don't you tie her
down?"

17:40.125 --> 17:42.126
Short answer, we did.

17:45.896 --> 17:47.832
Let me go, let me go!

17:53.438 --> 17:55.641
I think you gotta take me to a
hospital.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.180
And that's why we don't
handcuff Shelly,

18:01.880 --> 18:02.880
but a good thought.

18:04.182 --> 18:07.719
All right, one more email here.

18:07.751 --> 18:11.123
This one's from Mary q.

18:11.155 --> 18:13.724
"My husband's been sleepwalking
for the better part"

18:13.758 --> 18:17.496
"of three years, only
meaner when he wakes up."

18:17.528 --> 18:20.865
"Place padlocks on the
doors, then hide the key."

18:20.898 --> 18:22.633
"Let us know your results."

18:22.666 --> 18:26.137
Mary, yes, finally!

18:27.172 --> 18:28.172
All right.

18:29.707 --> 18:31.576
I knew there had to be someone
else

18:31.608 --> 18:33.811
dealing with something similar.

18:33.845 --> 18:38.350
I'd love to chat, email, phone,
your call.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.519
Talk soon, we'll give this a
try.

18:51.395 --> 18:53.798
It's been a week, and
Shelly still hasn't returned

18:53.830 --> 18:54.866
to her usual spot.

18:56.667 --> 18:58.436
I'm not sure what's changed.

18:59.938 --> 19:02.241
If you ask me, I think
she's getting worse.

19:03.508 --> 19:07.246
She's blacking out during
the day, way more than usual.

19:07.945 --> 19:10.314
I've got her doing strange
things,

19:11.548 --> 19:13.417
stranger than usual.

19:39.443 --> 19:40.443
You hear that?

19:44.848 --> 19:45.916
Static?

19:45.950 --> 19:47.519
You don't hear that?

19:47.551 --> 19:48.419
It's voices.

19:48.452 --> 19:50.888
And what are they saying?

19:50.922 --> 19:52.223
Can't make that out.

19:54.558 --> 19:55.993
It's weird, right?

19:56.027 --> 19:57.404
You gonna be okay
while I go to the office?

19:57.428 --> 19:59.531
Mm hmm, yeah, I'll be fine.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.531
Okay.

20:22.287 --> 20:23.755
Hey, sweetie, I'm home.

20:27.325 --> 20:28.492
Shelly?

20:32.630 --> 20:33.898
Babe, you awake?

20:36.768 --> 20:37.802
Shelly.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.038
Shelly.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.875
Honey, Shelly, I'm going
to take that knife.

20:46.778 --> 20:49.748
Shelly, I need you to wake up.

20:54.786 --> 20:55.887
Shelly.

21:01.392 --> 21:02.995
Hi, dinner's ready.

21:04.628 --> 21:06.330
Oh, I guess I made a mess.

21:07.597 --> 21:09.500
I'm gonna get a broom.

21:09.534 --> 21:10.534
Are you okay?

21:20.010 --> 21:21.946
Well, there goes our security
deposit.

21:22.946 --> 21:25.383
Like we
were gonna get that back.

21:26.416 --> 21:28.319
I just don't know how
I feel about listening

21:28.353 --> 21:30.855
to Mary q's suggestion.

21:30.887 --> 21:32.823
Isn't that the whole point of
this?

21:32.856 --> 21:34.992
Besides, what, are you scared of
Cate?

21:36.661 --> 21:38.697
I doubt he's ever gonna
find out about this.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.731
As we are literally recording
this

21:40.765 --> 21:43.535
with the intent to upload
it to the Internet.

21:43.567 --> 21:45.403
You know those voices in my head

21:45.435 --> 21:47.771
that I'm always telling you
about?

21:47.805 --> 21:51.043
Well, they're telling me
that this is not a good idea.

21:52.643 --> 21:53.754
I mean, you're locking us in.

21:53.778 --> 21:55.680
It's only at night.

21:55.712 --> 21:57.382
What if there's a fire?

21:57.414 --> 21:59.983
Babe, there's not gonna be any
fire.

22:00.017 --> 22:02.888
Besides, I shoulda did something
like this

22:03.887 --> 22:05.589
a long time ago.

22:08.025 --> 22:11.630
And if it doesn't keep
you from sleepwalking,

22:12.630 --> 22:15.500
it'll keep you inside at night,
yeah?

22:15.532 --> 22:17.032
That's a win in my book.

22:17.034 --> 22:19.003
Where are you gonna put the key?

22:19.036 --> 22:20.872
That's for me to know.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.006
What if I need it?

22:22.038 --> 22:23.107
Then I'll get it.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.808
That's what I'm talking about.

22:24.842 --> 22:26.719
If something happens to
you, what am I gonna do,

22:26.743 --> 22:27.911
knock down the door?

22:27.944 --> 22:30.013
If you know where it's at,

22:30.047 --> 22:32.451
doesn't that kinda
defeat the whole purpose?

22:35.586 --> 22:36.621
I don't know.

22:36.653 --> 22:40.692
Look, we can drop all
of this, call the doctor,

22:40.724 --> 22:42.426
if you'd rather do that.

22:42.460 --> 22:46.564
Well, just know that the
voice in my head are not happy.

22:46.596 --> 22:49.067
Yeah, that's no reason
to call the doctor.

22:59.943 --> 23:01.512
As we approach the end of July,

23:01.546 --> 23:04.082
there have been two new cases of
lv

23:04.115 --> 23:07.484
reported on the northern
part of the parish,

23:07.518 --> 23:10.488
but, this time, they're both
children.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.625
Doctors are reporting that
they are in stable condition.

23:13.657 --> 23:16.093
Their conditions will be closely
monitored

23:16.126 --> 23:18.629
for the next 48 hours.

23:25.603 --> 23:26.603
So how is it?

23:27.505 --> 23:28.973
It's delicious.

23:29.006 --> 23:30.006
This something new?

23:31.675 --> 23:32.886
Little something I found online.

23:32.910 --> 23:34.211
Well, you did a really great job

23:34.244 --> 23:35.846
of following the instructions.

23:41.251 --> 23:42.251
What's wrong?

23:43.253 --> 23:44.087
I thought that was your
favorite.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.957
Really, 'cause it tastes like
poison.

23:45.990 --> 23:46.990
You okay?

23:48.692 --> 23:49.594
You tired?

23:49.626 --> 23:50.626
I'm always tired.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.066
I'm always asleep.

23:55.098 --> 23:56.098
Or somewhere in between.

23:59.804 --> 24:02.740
It's just, you know,
sometimes I'm daydreaming

24:02.772 --> 24:04.641
about my everyday daily routine

24:04.674 --> 24:07.177
and then, bam, I wake up
and I'm somewhere else,

24:07.211 --> 24:08.613
doing something kooky.

24:09.547 --> 24:11.115
How do I know that I'm really
sitting

24:11.147 --> 24:12.683
here with you having this meal,

24:12.717 --> 24:15.520
or am I just dreaming about
something

24:15.553 --> 24:17.522
that happened two weeks ago?

24:17.555 --> 24:21.759
Or, maybe, I'm sleepwalking
right now,

24:21.791 --> 24:24.795
and this is just a conversation

24:24.828 --> 24:27.865
that's, you know, a reaction.

24:27.898 --> 24:32.236
It's just my mind on
autopilot, just saying

24:32.269 --> 24:34.972
whatever my subconscious
thinks that you wanna hear.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.008
Life is not a dream, sweetie.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.841
Then why do I feel like

24:37.875 --> 24:39.235
we've had this conversation
before?

24:45.615 --> 24:47.519
Can I ask you something?

24:47.551 --> 24:48.819
Yeah.

24:48.853 --> 24:53.557
When was the last time
that you felt carefree,

24:53.590 --> 24:55.692
like everything was just gonna
be fine.

24:55.726 --> 24:57.863
Babe, everybody's
dealing with something.

24:59.596 --> 25:00.965
Maybe this is our something.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.537
Yeah, well, I would trade our
something

25:05.569 --> 25:07.672
for someone else's something any
day.

25:07.704 --> 25:09.773
And then you might end up much
worse.

25:09.807 --> 25:12.611
Or, maybe, we could end
up finally having a kid,

25:13.611 --> 25:15.313
or we wouldn't have lost the
first one.

25:15.346 --> 25:17.248
You can't think like that.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.280
Well, I do.

25:22.185 --> 25:26.290
When was the last time
that you felt carefree,

25:28.893 --> 25:30.862
like everything was just gonna
be fine?

25:34.932 --> 25:39.938
Okay, it was probably the
last few days before I got sick.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.076
We went to that old burger
shack.

25:48.778 --> 25:51.182
That place is a dump.

25:51.214 --> 25:53.884
We only would go there if
we were too lazy to cook.

25:53.917 --> 25:57.254
The food was awful.

25:58.189 --> 26:00.191
So what was so special about
that day?

26:01.392 --> 26:02.392
Nothing.

26:04.761 --> 26:05.996
Absolutely nothing.

26:08.398 --> 26:10.100
And that's what made it so
great.

26:13.237 --> 26:15.140
It was the last normal day of my
life.

26:18.108 --> 26:21.111
I like that one, I'm
gonna steal that one.

26:22.346 --> 26:23.815
What about you?

26:23.847 --> 26:24.847
The same day.

26:26.416 --> 26:30.320
No, you can't have that one,
seriously.

26:30.354 --> 26:33.124
No, I meant it, I'm
gonna steal that one.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.993
At least I know it actually
happened.

28:46.824 --> 28:48.860
Well, at least I'm back to my
usual spot.

28:49.794 --> 28:50.995
Funny.

28:51.028 --> 28:53.064
Come on, you must have told me.

28:53.096 --> 28:54.898
There is no way I told you.

28:56.299 --> 28:58.001
Maybe I saw you hide it.

28:58.035 --> 28:59.003
You were in bed.

28:59.036 --> 29:01.939
And, besides, you look
like you're possessed.

29:01.971 --> 29:03.974
Why did you unplug the zapper?

29:04.008 --> 29:06.978
I don't know, maybe it was
bothering the demons inside me.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.112
I'm serious.

29:08.144 --> 29:10.048
Well, come on, don't be
ridiculous.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.921
I wanna do it again.

29:18.154 --> 29:19.154
Really?

29:19.990 --> 29:22.227
You don't find this the least
bit freaky?

29:23.527 --> 29:25.930
I mean, nothing surprises me
any more.

29:25.962 --> 29:27.197
This whole thing is weird.

29:28.365 --> 29:30.969
I just wanna see what what
happen if we tried it again.

31:03.093 --> 31:03.961
Can you explain that?

31:03.993 --> 31:04.995
It's adapting.

31:06.029 --> 31:07.131
What's adapting?

31:08.298 --> 31:10.500
Whatever it is that's inside
my head.

31:10.534 --> 31:12.003
It's doing whatever it's gotta
do

31:12.036 --> 31:13.438
to get me to do what it wants.

31:15.005 --> 31:17.175
Okay, so that's your medical
diagnosis?

31:18.608 --> 31:21.244
Why would you say it's
happening then?

31:21.278 --> 31:22.346
I'm not a doctor.

31:28.117 --> 31:30.621
I want you to show
these videos to Dr. Lopez.

31:31.521 --> 31:32.521
Finally,

31:35.459 --> 31:37.128
some common sense.

31:40.396 --> 31:42.066
Call tomorrow.

31:42.098 --> 31:43.098
Why?

31:46.369 --> 31:47.370
Why?

31:47.403 --> 31:50.008
The lv virus is everywhere.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.176
Lv is the new normal.

31:54.243 --> 31:58.014
Two weeks ago, none of
my staff or researchers

31:58.048 --> 31:59.717
were carrying the virus.

31:59.750 --> 32:04.955
Today, 70% are infected, so,
obviously,

32:05.756 --> 32:08.459
mosquitoes aren't the only
carriers.

32:10.193 --> 32:14.397
In the next year, I think
it's a real possibility

32:14.431 --> 32:18.501
99% of western civilization
could either be

32:18.535 --> 32:22.407
carrying the disease or
dead from complications.

32:23.773 --> 32:26.376
What can be done?

32:26.410 --> 32:28.680
I'm not sure anything can be
done.

32:30.079 --> 32:32.082
Quarantines haven't worked.

32:33.282 --> 32:37.521
We need to identify other
carriers,

32:38.555 --> 32:43.561
examine our blood supplies,
resume research on a vaccine.

33:03.680 --> 33:04.680
Shelly.

33:08.317 --> 33:09.353
Time to wake up.

33:51.361 --> 33:54.165
So what you about to do,
sweetie?

34:01.538 --> 34:03.406
Don't follow.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.141
I warned you.

34:38.742 --> 34:40.444
You're lucky she loves you.

34:53.523 --> 34:55.192
Shelly!

34:57.661 --> 34:58.661
Shelly!

35:01.764 --> 35:04.167
Shelly, wake up, for god's sake!

35:10.940 --> 35:12.442
This is all my fault.

35:13.443 --> 35:15.846
I should've called the fricking
doctor.

35:15.878 --> 35:18.648
I'll never forgive myself
if something happens to her.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.518
She's never wandered out this
far.

35:22.452 --> 35:23.320
I swear, she's gonna wake up

35:23.353 --> 35:25.356
and not know where the hell
she's at,

35:26.690 --> 35:28.893
or, worse, she stays asleep.

35:30.193 --> 35:31.193
Damn it!

35:43.539 --> 35:44.875
Hey, who's there?

35:48.679 --> 35:50.381
Shelly?

35:56.320 --> 35:58.689
Like a dumb-ass, left my phone at
home.

36:01.425 --> 36:03.861
Morning has to be a couple hours
away.

36:03.893 --> 36:05.895
Guys, this is as bad as it gets.

36:05.929 --> 36:10.434
I mean, there are bodies
of water everywhere,

36:10.467 --> 36:11.469
she can't swim.

36:12.369 --> 36:15.573
Wild animals, and fricking
mosquitoes.

36:28.784 --> 36:29.784
What happened?

36:31.822 --> 36:33.391
Your wife take the night off?

36:41.632 --> 36:43.267
Where the hell have you been?

36:49.505 --> 36:52.342
I was thrilled to wake up
in my own bed for once.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.912
So you don't remember
anything about last night?

36:54.945 --> 36:56.681
I never remember anything.

36:57.681 --> 36:58.816
What did I do?

36:58.849 --> 37:01.586
So what you gonna do, sweetie?

37:04.353 --> 37:05.422
Wasn't expecting that.

37:13.597 --> 37:14.799
Don't follow.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.039
I warned you.

37:24.740 --> 37:26.710
You're lucky she loves you.

37:33.849 --> 37:34.849
Shelly!

37:37.954 --> 37:38.954
Shelly!

37:42.025 --> 37:43.860
Shelly, wake up, for god's sake!

37:46.697 --> 37:48.599
You could've
gotten hurt out there.

37:51.434 --> 37:53.270
Yeah, and you could've died
out there.

37:54.938 --> 37:55.938
I know.

38:00.344 --> 38:01.811
Call Dr. Lopez if you want.

38:03.813 --> 38:05.348
I already did.

38:07.483 --> 38:10.353
I uploaded a video earlier for
him to see.

38:12.456 --> 38:15.492
Got a video conference
scheduled for later today.

38:20.396 --> 38:22.299
He's probably gonna admit me
again.

38:23.666 --> 38:24.735
You don't know that.

38:28.438 --> 38:29.740
Maybe that would be best.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.585
"She found the key, didn't she?"

38:42.985 --> 38:46.589
Found the key, who the
hell did she know that?

38:51.728 --> 38:54.398
Is that what happened with your
husband?

38:54.431 --> 38:55.633
Do you know how he did it?

39:00.503 --> 39:02.038
Please, respond, come on.

39:06.842 --> 39:08.111
Great.

39:10.045 --> 39:12.849
"Yes, but not ready to share."

39:12.882 --> 39:13.983
"Talk soon."

39:17.621 --> 39:19.490
The Internet is full of crazy
people.

39:26.128 --> 39:27.128
Do you see me?

39:28.065 --> 39:31.001
Hey, Dr. Lopez, yeah,
you're a little fuzzy.

39:31.034 --> 39:32.702
Hey, let me get Shelly, hold on.

39:34.503 --> 39:37.574
Hey, Shelly, Dr. Lopez.

39:37.606 --> 39:38.909
Is that any better?

39:40.643 --> 39:41.911
Oh, yeah, much better.

39:45.114 --> 39:45.882
Hey, Dr. Lopez.

39:45.916 --> 39:48.719
Good to see you, Shelly, Daniel.

39:48.751 --> 39:50.788
All right, I took a look at the
video,

39:50.820 --> 39:54.057
and I agree, these new
symptoms are troublesome.

39:55.592 --> 39:57.795
How do you feel, Shelly, tired?

39:57.827 --> 39:59.630
I'm always tired, but I guess

39:59.663 --> 40:01.565
that some days are better than
others.

40:01.597 --> 40:04.067
I'm gonna up the dose on your
trazodone

40:04.099 --> 40:06.103
to give you a little bit of
extra sleep.

40:07.570 --> 40:10.807
The following day, please,
check in with the nurse,

40:10.840 --> 40:12.675
and let us know if you have any
symptoms,

40:12.708 --> 40:14.677
any complications, et cetera.

40:14.710 --> 40:17.914
And are you still taking
the fertility drugs?

40:17.947 --> 40:19.615
Yeah.

40:19.648 --> 40:20.884
I want you to stop those

40:20.916 --> 40:23.920
until we have a better
understanding of what's going on.

40:23.954 --> 40:26.023
No, I can't do that.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.925
These medications, in rare
instances,

40:27.958 --> 40:30.126
can cause sleepwalking.

40:30.159 --> 40:33.696
I'm going to insist you
follow instructions.

40:33.730 --> 40:36.166
Daniel, I was curious, how did
you come by

40:36.199 --> 40:37.601
the video of your wife?

40:38.702 --> 40:41.672
We've got several cameras
set up around the house.

40:41.704 --> 40:43.239
For what purpose?

40:43.273 --> 40:45.876
Same as you, try to
figure this thing out.

40:45.909 --> 40:48.945
I'm sorry, but how do
you believe this will help?

40:48.978 --> 40:52.248
Research, try to see it
from a different angle.

40:52.282 --> 40:53.851
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,

40:53.884 --> 40:56.719
but do you have any medical
training?

40:56.753 --> 40:59.722
You and Shelly are accountants,
if I'm not mistaken.

40:59.755 --> 41:01.657
Yeah, that's correct.

41:01.690 --> 41:03.559
Do you feel qualified to do
this?

41:03.592 --> 41:05.962
No, I don't, but if we didn't,

41:05.996 --> 41:08.731
we wouldn't know about
all these new symptoms.

41:08.764 --> 41:10.008
Have you considered that turning

41:10.032 --> 41:11.701
your lives into an experiment

41:11.735 --> 41:14.570
is what's caused her condition
to worsen?

41:14.603 --> 41:15.806
If I'm to be honest,

41:15.838 --> 41:17.875
I think you should stop that
immediately.

41:22.612 --> 41:26.584
I'm fine with that, doc,
and I can get behind that,

41:28.751 --> 41:31.654
but can you please
explain to me, Dr. Lopez,

41:32.556 --> 41:35.525
how she continues to find the
key.

41:35.559 --> 41:36.961
Daniel thinks I'm possessed.

41:37.893 --> 41:41.664
Pure and simple,
sleepwalkers do strange things.

41:41.697 --> 41:43.799
I haven't reviewed enough of the
video

41:43.833 --> 41:46.302
or understand what Shelly's
observing

41:46.335 --> 41:50.306
to make an educated guess,
but I can assure you

41:50.340 --> 41:54.144
there's a perfectly reasonable
explanation for all this

41:54.177 --> 41:55.913
beyond possession.

41:55.945 --> 42:00.983
Do us all a favor, don't put
your wife under the microscope.

42:01.016 --> 42:02.285
Let's be patient here.

42:03.519 --> 42:06.590
I do believe that we are about
to turn a corner with this.

42:08.090 --> 42:11.694
Make sure to follow up, best of
luck.

42:18.034 --> 42:19.903
He doesn't know what he's
talking about.

42:19.936 --> 42:21.872
He is such an ass!

42:26.342 --> 42:29.145
I don't know, maybe he's got a
point.

42:30.780 --> 42:31.780
No!

42:32.916 --> 42:35.286
That's not it, this is beyond
him.

42:36.952 --> 42:38.922
The problem is, I need to start
listening

42:38.954 --> 42:40.090
to what's going on.

42:42.692 --> 42:44.027
What are you talking about?

42:46.061 --> 42:48.699
I need you to make sure
I stay inside tonight.

43:05.815 --> 43:07.017
I think I know what you are.

43:10.119 --> 43:10.953
It's okay.

43:10.987 --> 43:13.255
I'm listening now.

43:28.871 --> 43:31.074
Maybe this was a bad idea.

44:03.306 --> 44:04.306
Okay.

44:08.344 --> 44:12.750
Okay, you freaks, let's see
if you're paying attention.

44:27.463 --> 44:28.463
What?

44:30.432 --> 44:33.003
What the hell is that?

44:39.409 --> 44:41.311
Shelly!

44:41.344 --> 44:43.914
Shelly, what the hell
are you doing in there?

44:46.916 --> 44:49.986
Shelly, open, what the hell was
that?

45:13.510 --> 45:16.278
Daniel, I think we're being
attacked.

45:23.552 --> 45:24.552
Oh, shit!

45:33.496 --> 45:34.496
Shelly.

45:39.536 --> 45:40.536
Shelly?

46:12.501 --> 46:14.804
Shelly?

46:14.838 --> 46:15.838
Shelly?

46:29.853 --> 46:34.858
I haven't seen or heard
from my wife in two days.

46:37.260 --> 46:42.232
The ransom note, I don't
know who or why or what,

46:45.367 --> 46:50.340
but I know that multiple
people broke into this house

46:50.373 --> 46:51.875
and took my wife.

46:53.376 --> 46:56.947
And I say multiple because
that's the only way

46:56.980 --> 46:59.282
that I can explain what
happened.

46:59.315 --> 47:00.884
But I can tell you one thing,

47:02.184 --> 47:06.021
whoever took her, they've been

47:06.054 --> 47:09.024
watching us for quite some time.

47:09.057 --> 47:12.329
I mean, I've got cameras covering
every inch of this place,

47:13.896 --> 47:14.896
and I got nothing.

48:24.467 --> 48:27.471
Hi, detective, wasn't
expecting to see you today.

48:31.239 --> 48:33.285
Well, I thought we were due
for a little face-to-face.

48:33.309 --> 48:34.477
You wanna go inside.

48:34.510 --> 48:37.347
I don't think so, I'm not
a big fan of being recorded.

48:38.514 --> 48:40.250
Think you can turn this thing
off?

48:42.251 --> 48:43.519
Not from out here, no.

48:43.552 --> 48:45.422
Everything is controlled
from in the house.

48:45.454 --> 48:49.391
Fine, look, we've
watched all your tapes,

48:49.425 --> 48:52.461
everything you uploaded, and
I'm gonna be honest with you,

48:52.494 --> 48:55.231
is this whole thing
just some sort of hoax?

48:56.298 --> 48:58.101
I'm sorry, a what?

48:58.134 --> 48:58.969
A hoax.

48:59.001 --> 49:00.469
Is this a big joke to you?

49:00.503 --> 49:02.172
It's a game you're playing?

49:02.204 --> 49:03.639
A big cry for attention?

49:03.672 --> 49:05.107
Why would you ask me that?

49:05.141 --> 49:06.643
Because we watched the tapes.

49:07.744 --> 49:09.579
You didn't see the attackers?

49:09.612 --> 49:12.514
You didn't see the hand,
they guy on the roof?

49:12.547 --> 49:15.451
Yeah, we saw all of it,
and it's just the fact

49:15.485 --> 49:17.253
that you have it all recorded

49:17.286 --> 49:19.155
just seems a little bit
convenient.

49:20.056 --> 49:21.657
So I'm asking you one more time,

49:21.690 --> 49:23.235
is this whole thing
you're just trying to make

49:23.259 --> 49:25.061
fools out of our department?

49:25.094 --> 49:27.530
Somebody kidnapped my wife,
detective,

49:27.563 --> 49:29.231
and I showed you the proof.

49:29.264 --> 49:31.134
You gave us proof that you're
padlocking

49:31.166 --> 49:34.203
your front doors, playing
hide-and-go-seek with the keys,

49:34.237 --> 49:35.271
your wife attacking you,

49:35.304 --> 49:37.473
and your little midnight
stroll through the woods.

49:37.507 --> 49:38.641
So, if this is not a hoax,

49:38.673 --> 49:40.777
I think you have quite a bit to
explain.

49:40.809 --> 49:42.612
I'm just trying to help my wife.

49:42.644 --> 49:45.547
Yeah, so you say, but
I've heard that line before,

49:45.581 --> 49:47.182
only to have to come back and
arrest

49:47.215 --> 49:49.219
the same guy just a few days
later.

49:49.251 --> 49:51.554
So you're saying that I did
this?

49:51.586 --> 49:54.490
I'm not saying that,
but I'm not dismissing it.

49:54.523 --> 49:56.759
So do yourself a favor and
don't do anything crazy

49:56.793 --> 49:59.363
like go and leave town, you
understand?

50:00.762 --> 50:03.400
Yeah, I understand.

50:10.338 --> 50:11.338
I'll be in touch.

50:21.451 --> 50:25.155
"Your wife will return in six
days."

50:29.559 --> 50:33.764
How do you know that, do
you know where my wife is?

50:43.405 --> 50:46.842
"You'll understand in six days."

50:46.876 --> 50:48.644
"Talk to you later."

51:39.795 --> 51:40.795
No way.

51:47.170 --> 51:49.239
Thank you, I walked
outside and forgot my keys.

51:49.271 --> 51:52.208
I would forget my head
if it wasn't attached.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.519
I was gonna run and get some
things,

51:53.543 --> 51:54.919
and I'm gonna pick up some
breakfast.

51:54.943 --> 51:56.679
You want donuts?

51:56.711 --> 51:58.447
Chocolate, glazed?

51:58.481 --> 51:59.616
Where have you been?

52:00.916 --> 52:01.916
Outside.

52:07.222 --> 52:08.891
So you don't
remember any of this?

52:10.693 --> 52:13.296
I remember getting out
of bed and going outside,

52:13.329 --> 52:15.698
and then I locked myself out the
house.

52:15.731 --> 52:16.807
So where are we on breakfast?

52:16.831 --> 52:19.668
Do you want me to make
biscuits instead of donuts?

52:19.702 --> 52:21.871
This doesn't scare you?

52:21.903 --> 52:22.704
I'm over it.

52:22.737 --> 52:25.641
Someone took you from this
house,

52:25.675 --> 52:27.544
and you don't think this is a
big deal?

52:27.577 --> 52:28.887
I mean, how can I worry about
something

52:28.911 --> 52:30.480
that I don't even remember?

52:31.447 --> 52:33.349
So where are we on breakfast?

52:33.382 --> 52:35.418
Okay, so you don't remember
anything?

52:38.554 --> 52:42.692
But I will tell you that
I feel good, really good.

52:45.228 --> 52:46.262
Okay, there you go.

52:47.463 --> 52:50.699
I don't see anything left to
do except to close the case.

52:50.733 --> 52:52.501
Close the case?

52:52.534 --> 52:54.836
Yeah, is there any
reason why we shouldn't?

52:54.869 --> 52:57.839
Someone came and took her.

52:57.873 --> 52:59.943
I mean, who's to say they
won't try this again?

52:59.976 --> 53:02.811
Well, in my business, we
need something called leads.

53:02.844 --> 53:05.380
So, unless you have more
evidence to put forward,

53:05.414 --> 53:07.650
then, yeah, I'd say this case is
closed.

53:07.682 --> 53:10.719
I just don't feel like
this is good enough.

53:10.753 --> 53:11.754
Do you?

53:11.788 --> 53:14.523
I'm just glad that
this whole thing is over.

53:14.556 --> 53:17.392
Who's to say that
this won't happen again?

53:17.425 --> 53:21.264
I think it's safe to say that
this will not happen again.

53:21.297 --> 53:24.266
How can you say anything
if you're not doing anything?

53:24.300 --> 53:27.370
I think your wife has the
right idea here, my friend.

53:27.402 --> 53:30.005
These things don't
always end quite so well.

53:30.039 --> 53:31.674
I think you need to count your
blessings

53:31.706 --> 53:32.708
where you have them.

53:34.577 --> 53:36.946
I think he's right, Daniel.

53:42.851 --> 53:44.519
But we will continue to look
into it

53:44.552 --> 53:46.556
as much as we can manage.

53:46.588 --> 53:47.789
Are you satisfied?

53:55.864 --> 53:57.432
It's good to have you back.

53:57.465 --> 53:58.465
Thank you.

53:59.869 --> 54:00.869
I'll be in touch.

54:03.773 --> 54:05.041
You sure you wanna do this?

54:05.074 --> 54:06.276
Why?

54:06.309 --> 54:07.309
Don't you agree?

54:08.811 --> 54:10.913
I mean, it's all we ever wanted.

54:10.945 --> 54:14.016
Yeah, but I think it's time
that we stop

54:14.050 --> 54:16.987
trying for things that just
aren't meant for us, you know?

54:18.621 --> 54:20.056
I feel better already.

54:20.088 --> 54:22.759
It's time to let it go, all of
it, okay?

54:23.659 --> 54:24.794
You should try it.

54:30.800 --> 54:32.802
So what's the last thing you
remember?

54:34.903 --> 54:35.905
Losing my keys.

54:38.007 --> 54:39.442
And before that?

54:40.342 --> 54:43.045
Honestly, it's all kind of
fragmented.

54:45.715 --> 54:48.351
I remember eating dinner, maybe?

54:49.385 --> 54:51.421
I think we were watching
television?

54:52.855 --> 54:57.860
Or I think we were talking to
Dr. Lopez,

54:59.128 --> 55:03.667
or fighting, but, about what,
I can't really remember.

55:05.034 --> 55:06.034
It's weird, huh?

55:08.704 --> 55:10.673
I think weird seems to be our
normal.

55:14.909 --> 55:16.745
I don't want that to be us
anymore.

55:18.079 --> 55:19.915
I don't think it can be that
easy.

55:20.849 --> 55:21.849
Why not?

55:22.851 --> 55:25.888
Why not just let it go?

55:26.856 --> 55:29.792
You know how crazy that sounds?

55:29.824 --> 55:32.361
I mean, you realize you
were just kidnapped?

55:33.396 --> 55:36.599
We don't know by who, or why.

55:36.632 --> 55:39.402
We don't even know if they're
coming back.

55:39.434 --> 55:40.469
Why does it matter?

55:45.974 --> 55:47.076
Because I'm scared.

55:49.177 --> 55:51.880
You don't realize it, but today

55:51.914 --> 55:53.783
is the beginning of something
better.

55:55.717 --> 55:56.853
How can you say that?

55:59.155 --> 56:00.155
You'll see.

56:39.228 --> 56:40.228
Good morning.

56:42.097 --> 56:43.400
You're still here.

56:44.065 --> 56:46.168
After observing Shelly for
three days,

56:46.202 --> 56:49.939
I can comfortably say
that her sleep patterns

56:49.972 --> 56:51.707
have returned to normal.

56:51.739 --> 56:52.875
That's amazing.

56:55.844 --> 56:57.079
How is that possible?

56:57.980 --> 56:59.981
We've been dealing with this for
years.

57:00.014 --> 57:01.917
She goes and spends five
days out in the woods,

57:01.951 --> 57:04.019
and, all of a sudden, it's gone?

57:04.052 --> 57:06.989
These things disappear in
the same fashion they appear.

57:07.922 --> 57:11.193
But if that doesn't satisfy you,

57:11.226 --> 57:13.628
it's possible that ceasing
her fertility drugs

57:13.661 --> 57:16.498
have had some positive effect.

57:16.532 --> 57:19.202
Look, sorry, doc, we're just
not used

57:19.235 --> 57:20.570
to getting good news.

57:21.769 --> 57:23.806
You two have been through
enough.

57:23.838 --> 57:25.942
Go on and enjoy life.

57:25.974 --> 57:27.043
You two deserve it.

57:28.010 --> 57:31.481
If you need me, you know where
to find me.

57:31.514 --> 57:32.514
Thanks.

57:36.552 --> 57:41.557
Can you believe it?

57:56.105 --> 57:58.240
- Detective?
- Mind if I come in?

57:59.208 --> 58:00.208
Sure.

58:02.077 --> 58:03.145
Water?

58:03.177 --> 58:04.213
No, no, I'm fine.

58:08.050 --> 58:09.586
Oh, good, you're here, too.

58:10.686 --> 58:12.989
Something we can do for you,
detective?

58:13.021 --> 58:14.856
Well, I wanted to
come by because we came

58:14.889 --> 58:18.159
across something I think you
both will be interested in.

58:18.193 --> 58:20.563
We picked up a few kids for
vandalizing

58:20.596 --> 58:22.063
a house just up the street from
here,

58:22.097 --> 58:24.867
and we must have given
them a pretty good scare

58:24.900 --> 58:25.943
because they admitted to
everything

58:25.967 --> 58:29.605
from vandalizing that
house to cheating on tests

58:29.637 --> 58:31.773
to vandalizing this house.

58:31.806 --> 58:33.241
- Wait, what?
- Yep.

58:33.275 --> 58:36.112
They are the ones who
knocked your cameras over.

58:36.144 --> 58:39.215
- They kidnap her, too?
- No, no.

58:39.248 --> 58:41.717
But I've been thinking about
that a lot.

58:41.750 --> 58:44.753
She must have simply
crawled out of the window

58:45.688 --> 58:47.222
when you weren't paying
attention.

58:48.590 --> 58:49.590
Great.

58:50.925 --> 58:53.895
That finally sheds some
light on that night.

58:53.929 --> 58:54.929
Case closed.

58:56.731 --> 58:58.833
Now, do you want to press
charges.

58:58.867 --> 59:02.204
No, I'm sure those kids
are in enough trouble.

59:02.237 --> 59:03.673
Yes, ma'am, they are.

59:13.282 --> 59:15.651
I think the worst is behind us.

59:15.684 --> 59:18.120
The death rate has reached
what I would consider

59:18.152 --> 59:20.288
an acceptable point.

59:20.322 --> 59:22.625
In other words, the curve has
flattened.

59:24.693 --> 59:25.328
What makes you say that?

59:25.360 --> 59:26.628
Math.

59:26.661 --> 59:29.130
Lv is considerably more
contagious

59:29.164 --> 59:31.233
than we originally thought.

59:31.266 --> 59:35.171
Most of us have it at
this point and are fine.

59:36.070 --> 59:40.241
I think the best thing people
can do is live their lives

59:40.275 --> 59:42.077
and accept lv is going to be

59:42.110 --> 59:45.013
a part of our lives going
forward.

59:45.047 --> 59:46.682
What about a vaccine?

59:50.219 --> 59:52.355
We will be fine without a
vaccine.

1:00:11.806 --> 1:00:13.208
What you doing?

1:00:13.242 --> 1:00:15.277
I'm not sleepwalking, right?

1:00:15.309 --> 1:00:17.313
Not any more, no.

1:00:17.346 --> 1:00:20.916
Well, the experiment's over.

1:00:49.744 --> 1:00:51.913
Ah, man, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

1:00:51.947 --> 1:00:54.282
but I really think it's over.

1:00:56.418 --> 1:00:58.421
Ever since Shelly has came back,

1:01:01.056 --> 1:01:02.358
it's like it's the old her.

1:01:03.891 --> 1:01:08.329
It's like the Shelly I knew
even before I got sick.

1:01:08.362 --> 1:01:09.665
So I guess that's it.

1:01:11.166 --> 1:01:12.166
Thanks for watching.

1:01:13.936 --> 1:01:16.105
Next time I post a video,
hopefully,

1:01:16.137 --> 1:01:18.407
it will be of us at the beach.

1:01:19.842 --> 1:01:20.842
We did it.

1:02:33.114 --> 1:02:35.216
- You ready?
- Absolutely.

1:02:35.250 --> 1:02:36.985
Just wanna do one thing.

1:02:37.018 --> 1:02:37.886
Come here.

1:02:37.920 --> 1:02:39.488
Picture time?

1:02:40.422 --> 1:02:42.858
- You got it?
- Mm hmm.

1:02:56.237 --> 1:02:58.573
Look at this,
10 minutes into the trip

1:02:58.606 --> 1:03:00.375
and she's already asleep.

1:03:01.342 --> 1:03:02.854
Hey, babe, I'm going to
get something to eat.

1:03:02.878 --> 1:03:03.878
You want anything?

1:03:16.358 --> 1:03:18.961
Oh, turn the air off.

1:03:18.994 --> 1:03:20.963
My sinuses are starting to act
up.

1:03:21.929 --> 1:03:26.935
That noise, that fucking noise.

1:03:30.472 --> 1:03:32.307
And I might've let it go

1:03:32.340 --> 1:03:34.576
if it wasn't for that email from
Mary q.

1:03:35.978 --> 1:03:38.012
I know it's crazy to put so much
faith

1:03:38.045 --> 1:03:42.018
in someone you never met, but
she's been pretty dead on.

1:03:43.217 --> 1:03:47.188
And who knows, she, or maybe he,

1:03:47.222 --> 1:03:50.492
whoever the hell is a part of
this,

1:03:50.525 --> 1:03:54.063
manipulating me, who knows,

1:03:54.929 --> 1:03:57.065
but I had to see where
the rabbit hole went.

1:04:43.277 --> 1:04:45.313
Hey, sweetie, I'm gonna
be in the office today.

1:04:52.253 --> 1:04:56.525
It seems, when I wasn't home,
she started acting weird.

1:04:57.458 --> 1:04:59.060
Again.

1:05:25.753 --> 1:05:27.722
And now things are worse.

1:05:27.755 --> 1:05:29.123
Much worse.

1:05:44.472 --> 1:05:46.175
Why are you still recording me?

1:05:48.443 --> 1:05:50.179
'Cause you're not well.

1:05:50.211 --> 1:05:50.880
What?

1:05:50.913 --> 1:05:52.981
I haven't slept-walked in weeks.

1:05:53.014 --> 1:05:55.416
Why can't you be glad that
this whole thing's over?

1:05:55.449 --> 1:05:56.985
Because it isn't.

1:05:57.018 --> 1:05:58.186
You know what?

1:05:58.219 --> 1:06:00.188
I think that you like me sick,

1:06:00.222 --> 1:06:02.490
like me being dependent on you.

1:06:02.523 --> 1:06:05.661
Why can't you just accept
that things are normal now

1:06:05.693 --> 1:06:07.462
and be happy for once?

1:06:07.496 --> 1:06:08.698
This isn't normal.

1:06:09.797 --> 1:06:12.467
I don't even think
you're even you anymore.

1:06:12.501 --> 1:06:13.711
What, what does that even mean?

1:06:13.735 --> 1:06:16.504
It means I don't
think my wife ever came home.

1:06:17.672 --> 1:06:18.672
Then who am I?

1:06:19.440 --> 1:06:20.976
I don't know, you tell me.

1:06:21.675 --> 1:06:23.344
What happened in the woods?

1:06:23.378 --> 1:06:24.747
I told you,

1:06:24.780 --> 1:06:28.083
- I don't remember.
- Remember, yeah.

1:06:28.115 --> 1:06:30.119
I've already heard that.

1:06:30.152 --> 1:06:33.021
So how about this time, you
try telling me the truth.

1:06:33.054 --> 1:06:34.690
I'm not doing this with you.

1:06:34.722 --> 1:06:36.324
I need you to cut your hand.

1:06:37.492 --> 1:06:38.694
I need to see your blood.

1:06:41.228 --> 1:06:42.697
I'm leaving.

1:06:56.744 --> 1:06:58.212
You can't just leave.

1:06:58.246 --> 1:06:59.715
Yeah, why not?

1:06:59.748 --> 1:07:01.182
Because this isn't over.

1:07:02.483 --> 1:07:05.086
This is definitely over.

1:07:12.827 --> 1:07:14.596
Shelly.

1:07:14.628 --> 1:07:17.365
- Shelly, please.
- Let go!

1:07:17.398 --> 1:07:18.398
Come on!

1:07:20.768 --> 1:07:21.768
Shelly?

1:07:25.273 --> 1:07:26.273
Oh, shit.

1:07:32.380 --> 1:07:34.182
So here we are.

1:07:34.215 --> 1:07:37.219
Daniel, Daniel, where are you?

1:07:38.686 --> 1:07:43.092
Daniel, you need to untie me
right now!

1:07:47.661 --> 1:07:52.667
You're right, you're right,
but first things first.

1:07:54.436 --> 1:07:57.306
What happened in the woods.

1:07:57.338 --> 1:07:58.407
I told you.

1:07:58.440 --> 1:07:59.474
The truth, damn it!

1:08:01.309 --> 1:08:05.081
I want you to tell me the truth,
or else.

1:08:06.213 --> 1:08:07.213
Or else what?

1:08:08.184 --> 1:08:10.820
You gonna hurt me, you
gonna hurt your wife?

1:08:11.719 --> 1:08:13.387
Is that what you've come to?

1:08:13.420 --> 1:08:15.290
You are not Shelly!

1:08:16.891 --> 1:08:18.359
You've lost it, sweetie.

1:08:19.860 --> 1:08:21.764
You're the sick one.

1:08:23.398 --> 1:08:27.202
Maybe we should've been
recording you this whole time

1:08:27.234 --> 1:08:30.139
so that we can show the world
what a sick asshole you are!

1:08:32.606 --> 1:08:35.243
Fine, fine.

1:08:42.384 --> 1:08:44.286
Last time I'm going to ask.

1:08:45.353 --> 1:08:47.588
Wait, wait, Daniel, what are
you doing?

1:08:47.622 --> 1:08:49.391
Mary said proof is in the blood,

1:08:49.423 --> 1:08:52.560
so we're gonna see exactly what
she meant.

1:09:04.672 --> 1:09:09.177
Shelly, why are there worms
inside of you?

1:09:10.779 --> 1:09:15.584
You really screwed up now.

1:09:37.905 --> 1:09:41.176
What the hell is that on the
floor?

1:09:43.545 --> 1:09:45.247
Will you talk to me?

1:09:45.279 --> 1:09:48.349
You need to untie me
before this gets out of hand.

1:09:48.382 --> 1:09:49.382
Out of hand?

1:09:50.652 --> 1:09:52.320
This is pretty much out of hand.

1:09:53.787 --> 1:09:57.992
Are you even Shelly anymore, are
you?

1:09:58.025 --> 1:09:59.728
What does it matter?

1:09:59.761 --> 1:10:01.964
You're not gonna believe
me one way or the other.

1:10:01.997 --> 1:10:04.298
I'll believe whatever you tell
me.

1:10:04.332 --> 1:10:08.503
Good, first, you need
to go and take my friends

1:10:08.536 --> 1:10:10.573
and put them inside something
safe.

1:10:11.506 --> 1:10:13.309
- Your friends.
- On the floor.

1:10:14.376 --> 1:10:15.476
You're not Shelly.

1:10:51.912 --> 1:10:56.584
What the hell was that?

1:11:20.641 --> 1:11:21.841
Who the hell are these people?

1:11:23.912 --> 1:11:25.381
I would not do that.

1:11:26.814 --> 1:11:28.349
Why not?

1:11:28.382 --> 1:11:29.559
Because the minute
you walk out that door,

1:11:29.583 --> 1:11:30.719
they're gonna kill you.

1:11:31.819 --> 1:11:33.521
Why would you even tell me that?

1:11:33.555 --> 1:11:35.524
Wouldn't it be easier
just to let them do it?

1:11:35.556 --> 1:11:39.661
Yes, but Shelly loves you,

1:11:39.694 --> 1:11:40.905
and, if something were to happen
to you,

1:11:40.929 --> 1:11:45.833
it would cause her sadness,
and we can't let that happen.

1:11:45.867 --> 1:11:48.036
It would make her less
manageable.

1:11:48.069 --> 1:11:49.069
We?

1:11:51.605 --> 1:11:52.573
The worms?

1:11:52.606 --> 1:11:54.443
I don't wanna sound
like one of your movies,

1:11:54.475 --> 1:11:58.913
but we are not of this world.

1:11:58.947 --> 1:12:01.416
The term you use is alien.

1:12:01.448 --> 1:12:04.786
Look, all I want is my wife.

1:12:04.819 --> 1:12:06.722
That's not possible.

1:12:06.755 --> 1:12:09.591
Why, why is that not possible?

1:12:11.158 --> 1:12:13.695
Shelly and us are one now.

1:12:14.595 --> 1:12:17.098
If we left, billions would die.

1:12:17.966 --> 1:12:20.836
You see, Daniel, Shelly now
represents

1:12:20.868 --> 1:12:24.872
millions of our people and, if
she dies,

1:12:24.905 --> 1:12:27.943
it would be like wiping
out an entire country.

1:12:27.975 --> 1:12:32.980
I'm sure you can understand
that we cannot let that happen.

1:12:37.719 --> 1:12:41.623
Who the hell is that?

1:12:41.655 --> 1:12:42.655
May we come in?

1:12:48.529 --> 1:12:50.398
Put down the knife.

1:12:50.431 --> 1:12:51.733
Put down the gun.

1:12:51.765 --> 1:12:53.768
We both know you're
not gonna hurt your wife.

1:12:53.801 --> 1:12:56.505
You don't know what
the hell I'm gonna do.

1:12:56.537 --> 1:12:58.606
I'm not even sold that this is
my wife.

1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:01.777
We are gonna be brutally
honest here.

1:13:05.747 --> 1:13:07.883
You know way more than we'd
like.

1:13:07.916 --> 1:13:11.485
Most of us would like to
eliminate you.

1:13:11.519 --> 1:13:15.190
I just want my wife back, worm
free.

1:13:15.222 --> 1:13:18.592
Shelly already explained
that it's not possible.

1:13:18.626 --> 1:13:19.626
We are joined.

1:13:20.628 --> 1:13:24.500
That colony will be with
her til the end of her days.

1:13:25.199 --> 1:13:28.702
Their children will
populate another and another

1:13:28.735 --> 1:13:31.172
and so on and so on.

1:13:31.206 --> 1:13:34.109
Well, then take me instead.

1:13:34.141 --> 1:13:35.141
We tried.

1:13:36.109 --> 1:13:37.880
But some bodies reject us.

1:13:39.113 --> 1:13:40.716
Most of them do not survive.

1:13:42.182 --> 1:13:43.518
The lv?

1:13:43.551 --> 1:13:45.053
Yes, lv.

1:13:45.086 --> 1:13:47.789
Originally, we used
mosquitoes as transport,

1:13:49.023 --> 1:13:52.795
a way for our children to
populate other colonies,

1:13:53.828 --> 1:13:56.498
new bodies, warm bodies.

1:13:57.532 --> 1:13:59.201
So this is an invasion.

1:13:59.234 --> 1:14:00.436
Colonization.

1:14:01.569 --> 1:14:04.573
It's more like cohabitation.

1:14:05.506 --> 1:14:07.041
I don't care what the hell it
is.

1:14:07.074 --> 1:14:08.943
I'm not gonna let you get away
with this.

1:14:08.976 --> 1:14:11.011
Jeez, you were supposed
to be finding a cure,

1:14:11.045 --> 1:14:13.515
but, instead, you were making it
worse.

1:14:13.547 --> 1:14:14.547
Humans.

1:14:15.050 --> 1:14:17.085
I wish we were compatible with
dogs

1:14:17.118 --> 1:14:20.055
or anything else on this
miserable rock,

1:14:20.087 --> 1:14:21.087
but here we are.

1:14:22.823 --> 1:14:23.823
Do the right thing.

1:14:25.592 --> 1:14:26.795
Let Shelly go.

1:14:26.828 --> 1:14:28.030
Let Shelly go.

1:14:28.962 --> 1:14:30.465
Let Shelly go.

1:14:34.068 --> 1:14:35.136
You know what,

1:14:38.840 --> 1:14:43.144
I'm taking my wife and
getting the hell out of here.

1:14:43.176 --> 1:14:44.645
I'll have to handle this.

1:15:00.295 --> 1:15:02.163
- Wait.
- Why?

1:15:03.131 --> 1:15:05.200
Would it not be easier
if he were just gone?

1:15:05.233 --> 1:15:06.802
There's no risk here.

1:15:08.802 --> 1:15:10.905
We see it differently.

1:15:16.677 --> 1:15:18.012
Most unfortunate.

1:15:51.746 --> 1:15:52.746
They're safe.

1:15:53.981 --> 1:15:55.884
Only the host has expired.

1:15:57.885 --> 1:15:59.555
No need to execute this man.

1:16:03.056 --> 1:16:05.859
Besides, he was just defending
himself.

1:16:14.135 --> 1:16:15.904
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

1:16:16.871 --> 1:16:19.841
You should know that Shelly is
not gone.

1:16:20.707 --> 1:16:24.645
We influence, but we try not to
interfere.

1:16:25.380 --> 1:16:28.182
You could've lived your
whole life with her,

1:16:28.216 --> 1:16:30.719
but you had to know.

1:16:30.752 --> 1:16:32.654
You couldn't just be happy.

1:16:32.686 --> 1:16:35.724
Please, don't take my wife.

1:16:35.756 --> 1:16:36.756
Goodbye.

1:16:38.259 --> 1:16:41.663
Finally, there's life.

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:48.302
No, wait.

1:16:51.305 --> 1:16:52.708
I'm gonna tell everybody.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:54.842
Tell whomever you want.

1:16:55.976 --> 1:16:57.912
Those we have bonded with will
see

1:16:57.944 --> 1:17:00.782
whatever we want them to see, a
movie.

1:17:02.417 --> 1:17:06.655
Those who can't or haven't
will see a crazy man.

1:18:28.136 --> 1:18:30.405
What do you want?

1:18:32.873 --> 1:18:34.443
I wanted to make sure you were
okay.

1:18:38.212 --> 1:18:40.382
Yeah, what do you know about
all this?

1:18:43.251 --> 1:18:44.251
I pay attention.

1:18:46.052 --> 1:18:47.988
I really like the videos that
you post.

1:18:51.024 --> 1:18:52.393
I also go by Mary q.

1:18:54.462 --> 1:18:55.930
What?

1:18:55.962 --> 1:18:57.032
She's my sister.

1:18:58.466 --> 1:19:01.470
I use the alias to help
others like us, the immune.

1:19:10.411 --> 1:19:12.046
Come on, let's get you outta
here.

1:19:32.432 --> 1:19:35.436
So is the lv
virus alien in nature?

1:19:36.837 --> 1:19:41.842
To say lv is alien in nature

1:19:42.542 --> 1:19:46.814
is unbelievably ridiculous.

1:19:46.847 --> 1:19:50.385
But, as we've already
seen, there's a small group

1:19:50.417 --> 1:19:52.820
of the population that will
believe

1:19:52.854 --> 1:19:57.292
any ridiculous conspiracy
theory tossed on the Internet.

1:19:58.626 --> 1:20:02.564
These are the same people
that wear aluminum foil hats.

1:20:03.965 --> 1:20:06.967
You can trust your government.

1:20:07.001 --> 1:20:10.070
We have your best interests at
heart,

1:20:10.104 --> 1:20:13.475
and we will do everything
we can to protect you.

1:20:15.443 --> 1:20:17.011
And if you don't believe us,

1:20:17.043 --> 1:20:19.914
I'm confident that you will
soon.
