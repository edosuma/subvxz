WEBVTT

00:04.714 --> 00:07.465
Captain's log, stardate 5630.7.

00:07.633 --> 00:09.875
We have been assigned to convey
the Medusan's ambassador

00:10.053 --> 00:12.460
to the Federation
back to their home planet.

00:12.639 --> 00:15.972
While the thoughts of the Medusans
are the most sublime in the galaxy,

00:16.142 --> 00:18.764
their physical appearance
is exactly the opposite.

00:18.937 --> 00:22.104
They have evolved into
a race of beings who are formless,

00:22.274 --> 00:25.975
so utterly hideous,
that the sight of a Medusan

00:26.153 --> 00:29.487
brings total madness
to any human who sees one.

00:29.657 --> 00:31.448
Mr. Marvick.

00:31.826 --> 00:34.661
- I am James Kirk, the captain.
- Captain, what are you doing here?

00:34.829 --> 00:36.822
You'll have to leave before
the ambassador arrives.

00:36.998 --> 00:39.703
Everything will be taken care of.
This is Mr. Spock, my first officer.

00:39.876 --> 00:42.118
Yes, you're the Vulcan.
It's all right for you to remain,

00:42.295 --> 00:43.790
but you, Captain,
and this gentleman...

00:43.964 --> 00:46.336
Montgomery Scott, chief engineer.
Call me Scotty.

00:46.508 --> 00:47.837
Mr. Spock, do you have the visor?

00:48.010 --> 00:49.124
You must be sure to wear it.

00:49.303 --> 00:51.759
Humans who get even a glimpse
of Medusans have gone insane.

00:51.931 --> 00:54.137
Thank you, Mr. Marvick,
I shall be wearing the visor.

00:54.308 --> 00:55.802
We mustn't keep
the ambassador waiting.

00:55.977 --> 00:59.013
If you'll go with Mr. Scott, the two of
you will have a great deal in common.

00:59.188 --> 01:02.688
Indeed. It's a rare privilege meeting
one of the designers of the Enterprise.

01:02.859 --> 01:03.890
Lieutenant Uhura,

01:04.069 --> 01:07.105
open a channel to Transporter
Control Centre on the planet.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.609
Aye, sir.

01:08.782 --> 01:11.403
This is Captain Kirk,
inform the ambassador and Dr. Jones

01:11.577 --> 01:13.949
we're ready to beam them aboard.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.204
Kirk out.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.997
Are you sure this visor will work?

01:19.168 --> 01:20.710
It has proved effective for Vulcans.

01:20.878 --> 01:22.372
It's your human half
I'm worried about.

01:22.547 --> 01:24.623
I shall endeavour
to keep it under control.

01:24.799 --> 01:27.373
Inform me when
transport is complete.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.667 --> 02:01.500
Welcome aboard, Ambassador Kollos.
I am First Officer Spock.

02:02.381 --> 02:03.709
I'm Dr. Jones.

02:07.261 --> 02:11.389
The ambassador is most honoured
to meet you, Mr. Spock.

02:33.122 --> 02:36.621
Space, the final frontier.

02:42.090 --> 02:46.218
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

02:46.386 --> 02:50.431
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

02:50.599 --> 02:54.300
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

02:54.478 --> 02:57.812
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

03:55.001 --> 03:56.661
Captain Kirk, we are ready.

03:56.836 --> 04:00.040
Lieutenant Uhura,
open a channel to all decks.

04:01.716 --> 04:03.092
Channel open, sir.

04:03.260 --> 04:06.759
This is Captain Kirk
to all ship's personnel.

04:06.930 --> 04:08.638
Clearance plans now in effect.

04:08.807 --> 04:11.049
Clear passageways immediately.

04:11.226 --> 04:15.889
The ambassador will be escorted
to his quarters at once.

04:32.666 --> 04:34.742
Dr. Jones, may I congratulate you

04:34.918 --> 04:37.041
on your assignment
with Ambassador Kollos.

04:37.212 --> 04:40.582
Thank you.
But the assignment's not yet definite.

04:40.758 --> 04:44.008
It will depend upon my ability
to achieve a true mind-link...

04:44.178 --> 04:45.423
...with the ambassador.

04:45.596 --> 04:48.432
I'm sure you will find it
a fascinating experience.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.890
I wasn't aware that anyone
had ever achieved

04:52.062 --> 04:53.686
a mind-link with the Medusans.

04:53.855 --> 04:54.887
No one ever has.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.939
I was referring to mind-links
I had attempted

04:57.109 --> 04:59.018
with members of other species.

05:00.279 --> 05:01.393
I've heard, Mr. Spock,

05:01.572 --> 05:04.906
that you turned down the assignment
with the ambassador.

05:06.035 --> 05:10.365
I was unable to accept.
My life is here.

05:30.811 --> 05:34.227
Spock to Bridge, we have arrived
at the ambassador's quarters.

05:34.649 --> 05:37.650
Thank you, Mr. Spock.
Notify all hands to return to stations.

05:37.819 --> 05:39.977
All right, let's take her out.
Warp factor 2.

05:40.155 --> 05:42.278
Warp factor 2, sir.

05:53.502 --> 05:54.961
I would appreciate an opportunity

05:55.129 --> 05:57.169
to exchange greetings
with the ambassador.

06:04.180 --> 06:07.300
I'm sure the ambassador
would be charmed.

06:54.859 --> 06:57.018
I almost envy you your assignment.

06:58.363 --> 07:02.064
I see in your mind
that you are tempted to take my place.

07:03.577 --> 07:04.988
Not correct, doctor.

07:05.829 --> 07:09.993
Although I am aware of your mind
attempting to contact mine.

07:10.751 --> 07:12.080
Were you born a telepath?

07:12.962 --> 07:14.373
Yes.

07:14.547 --> 07:16.421
That is why I had to study on Vulcan.

07:16.966 --> 07:18.793
I understand.

07:18.968 --> 07:20.712
May I show you to your quarters?

07:20.887 --> 07:23.176
I think I'll stay here a bit.

07:23.348 --> 07:26.717
Ambassador Kollos often finds
the process of transport

07:26.893 --> 07:28.139
somewhat unsettling.

07:28.312 --> 07:29.640
I understand.

07:29.813 --> 07:33.348
Our ship's surgeon
often makes the same complaint.

07:33.526 --> 07:36.443
Do call when you are ready.

07:48.041 --> 07:50.912
What is it he sees
when he looks at you?

07:52.754 --> 07:54.913
I must know.

08:02.390 --> 08:06.138
I can't understand
why they let you go with Kollos.

08:06.310 --> 08:07.556
"They," captain?

08:07.729 --> 08:10.564
The male population
of the Federation.

08:11.232 --> 08:13.106
Didn't someone
try and talk you out of it?

08:13.276 --> 08:14.308
Now that you ask, yes.

08:14.486 --> 08:17.155
Well, I'm glad he didn't succeed,
otherwise I wouldn't have met you.

08:17.322 --> 08:18.354
Thank you, captain.

08:18.532 --> 08:21.486
Tell me, Dr. Jones, why isn't it
dangerous for you to be with Kollos?

08:21.660 --> 08:24.330
Spock, I can understand,
nothing makes an impression on him.

08:24.497 --> 08:27.581
- Why, thank you, captain.
- You're very welcome, Mr. Spock.

08:27.750 --> 08:32.128
But as I understand it, no human
can look at Kollos, even with a visor,

08:32.297 --> 08:34.039
without going mad.
How do you manage?

08:34.215 --> 08:37.169
I spent four years on Vulcan
studying their mental discipline.

08:37.344 --> 08:40.131
- You poor girl.
- On the contrary, doctor.

08:40.597 --> 08:44.013
I would say that Dr. Jones
was indeed fortunate.

08:44.183 --> 08:48.265
- Vulcan is not my idea of fun.
- Joy can be many things, doctor.

08:48.439 --> 08:52.188
On Vulcan, I learned to do things
impossible to learn anywhere else.

08:52.360 --> 08:55.029
- To read minds?
- How not to read them, captain.

08:56.072 --> 08:57.103
I don't understand.

08:57.281 --> 08:59.855
Dr. Jones was born a telepath,
captain.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.827
Vulcan was necessary to my sanity.

09:05.999 --> 09:09.203
What most humans
generally find impossible to understand

09:09.378 --> 09:11.038
is the need to shut out the bedlam

09:11.213 --> 09:13.502
of other people's
thoughts and emotions.

09:13.674 --> 09:17.126
Or of their own
thoughts and emotions.

09:17.511 --> 09:21.640
I was just noticing
your Vulcan IDIC, Mr. Spock.

09:22.558 --> 09:24.468
Is it a reminder that as a Vulcan

09:24.644 --> 09:28.689
you can mind-link with the Medusans
far better than I could?

09:30.192 --> 09:35.779
Well, I doubt that Mr. Spock would don
the most revered of all Vulcan symbols

09:35.948 --> 09:38.190
merely to annoy you, Dr. Jones.

09:38.367 --> 09:39.742
As a matter of fact,

09:39.910 --> 09:42.781
I wear it this evening
to honour you, doctor.

09:42.955 --> 09:43.986
Indeed.

09:44.165 --> 09:46.786
That's very interesting,
I might even say fascinating,

09:46.959 --> 09:48.584
but back to your mission.

09:48.753 --> 09:51.078
Doctor,
do you feel any way may be found

09:51.256 --> 09:54.008
to employ Medusan navigators
on starships?

09:54.175 --> 09:56.548
It would certainly solve
many of our navigational problems.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.293
Well, the key is the mind-link
that I learned on Vulcan.

09:59.473 --> 10:00.801
Once we have learned the technique

10:00.974 --> 10:03.762
of forming a corporate intelligence
with the Medusans,

10:03.936 --> 10:06.261
the designers,
that's where Larry comes in,

10:06.439 --> 10:09.060
can work on adapting instruments.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.270
I don't care how benevolent
the Medusans are supposed to be,

10:12.445 --> 10:16.823
isn't it suicidal to deal with something
ugly enough to drive men mad?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.071
Why do you do it?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.319
I see, Dr. McCoy,
that you still subscribe

10:20.495 --> 10:23.911
to the outmoded notion
promulgated by your ancient Greeks

10:24.082 --> 10:27.617
that what is good
must also be beautiful.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.254
And the reverse of course,

10:29.421 --> 10:31.794
that what is beautiful
is automatically expected to be good.

10:31.966 --> 10:35.300
Yes, I think most of us are attracted
by beauty and repelled by ugliness.

10:35.470 --> 10:37.961
One of the last of our prejudices.

10:38.139 --> 10:42.267
At the risk of sounding prejudiced,
gentlemen, here's to beauty.

10:43.395 --> 10:48.021
To Miranda Jones, the loveliest human
ever to grace a starship.

10:49.735 --> 10:51.727
How can one so beautiful
condemn herself

10:51.904 --> 10:54.062
to look upon ugliness
the rest of her life?

10:56.117 --> 10:58.655
- Will we allow it, gentlemen?
- Certainly not.

10:58.828 --> 11:01.948
How can one so full of joy
and the love of life as you, doctor,

11:02.123 --> 11:06.999
condemn yourself to look upon disease
and suffering for the rest of your life?

11:07.170 --> 11:09.163
Can we allow that, gentlemen?

11:10.173 --> 11:13.210
To whatever you want the most,
Miranda.

11:21.894 --> 11:24.350
Some more Antarean brandy?

11:27.150 --> 11:28.644
What is it?

11:30.904 --> 11:33.940
There's somebody nearby
thinking of murder.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.537
- In this room?
- It's gone now.

11:48.214 --> 11:49.328
Who is it? Can you tell?

11:53.219 --> 11:55.128
It isn't there anymore.

11:56.931 --> 11:59.008
Captain, would you mind
if I said good night?

11:59.184 --> 12:02.304
- Of course. Perhaps I'll see you...
- Escort you to your quarters.

12:02.479 --> 12:06.263
Thank you, gentlemen.
You make a choice impossible.

12:06.650 --> 12:09.188
Please, stay and enjoy yourselves.

12:09.361 --> 12:14.403
- It was a delightful dinner.
- Sleep well, Miranda.

12:17.453 --> 12:19.576
Are you sure you're well enough
to find your way alone?

12:19.747 --> 12:23.876
Of course, Dr. McCoy.
Please, don't worry about me.

12:32.469 --> 12:34.462
Where I come from,
that's what we call a lady.

12:34.638 --> 12:38.054
- Yes, she is something special.
- Very special.

12:38.476 --> 12:40.682
I suggest you treat her accordingly.

12:40.853 --> 12:44.768
I've known Dr. Jones long enough
to be aware of her remarkable gifts.

12:47.694 --> 12:49.603
Well, it's been a long day for me.

12:51.156 --> 12:53.729
Laddie, would you like to stop off
at Engineering with me?

12:53.909 --> 12:55.024
I have a few things to check.

12:55.202 --> 12:59.911
And a bottle of Scotch says that you
can't handle the controls you designed.

13:00.082 --> 13:01.457
Some other time.

13:01.625 --> 13:04.199
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night, Scotty.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.090
You're dressed up for the occasion,
Spock, very impressive.

13:07.256 --> 13:10.626
I genuinely intended
to honour her, captain.

13:10.802 --> 13:14.847
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening. Sleep well.

13:16.224 --> 13:17.802
Bones.

13:18.226 --> 13:20.053
What's troubling you with the girl?

13:20.229 --> 13:22.898
Well, she's not just another girl,
captain, don't make that mistake.

13:23.065 --> 13:25.223
Oh, I didn't think that for a moment.
What else?

13:25.401 --> 13:29.730
I don't know what it is exactly.
She seems very vulnerable.

13:29.906 --> 13:34.484
We're all vulnerable
in one way or another.

13:34.661 --> 13:38.955
Of course. But there's something
so very disturbing about her.

13:40.542 --> 13:42.950
Meaning she's quite a woman.

13:43.545 --> 13:44.920
I agree.

13:48.008 --> 13:49.800
Good night, Jim.

13:49.969 --> 13:51.712
Good night, Bones.

14:11.283 --> 14:12.861
Miranda?

14:15.621 --> 14:18.077
- Who is it?
- Larry.

14:18.249 --> 14:20.040
I've got to talk to you.

14:20.209 --> 14:24.290
- It's late.
- Please, Miranda, it's important.

14:25.423 --> 14:26.965
All right. Come in, then.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.010
I thought the dinner
was never going to end.

14:36.185 --> 14:38.676
I rather enjoyed it.

14:39.563 --> 14:41.520
Yes, I know you did.

14:42.858 --> 14:44.518
I didn't.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.311
You were so far away.

14:50.533 --> 14:54.448
- I'll be further away than that soon.
- Please don't talk of that.

14:54.621 --> 14:56.744
There's so little time.

14:57.415 --> 14:59.704
Please, Miranda,
don't go with Kollos.

14:59.876 --> 15:03.411
Now, we've been over this
time and time again.

15:03.589 --> 15:05.416
Don't I know.

15:05.925 --> 15:08.594
I've asked you in restaurants,
in the laboratory,

15:08.761 --> 15:11.964
on one knee, on both knees.

15:14.267 --> 15:15.726
Miranda, how can you do this?

15:15.894 --> 15:19.097
Larry, please, try to understand.

15:19.272 --> 15:21.099
I understand.

15:22.067 --> 15:23.609
That you're a woman,
and that I'm a man,

15:23.777 --> 15:25.188
one of your own kind.

15:25.362 --> 15:28.778
And that Kollos will never be able to
give you anything like this.

15:42.714 --> 15:46.628
- Why did I ever meet you?
- I've been honest with you.

15:46.927 --> 15:50.378
I simply cannot love you
the way you want me to.

15:50.931 --> 15:53.600
- Miranda.
- And I'm going away with Kollos.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.926
That's final.

15:56.770 --> 15:59.143
I think you'd better leave now.

16:07.490 --> 16:08.688
So it's you.

16:13.622 --> 16:16.243
I didn't know that it was you before.

16:18.085 --> 16:20.291
Who is it you want to kill, Larry?
Is it me?

16:26.677 --> 16:29.169
You mustn't keep this to yourself.

16:29.347 --> 16:31.138
I want to help you.

16:31.307 --> 16:33.466
So now you want to help me?

16:34.352 --> 16:38.646
Now I know what a mere human male
has to do to get a reaction out of you.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.308
Make you think he's a patient.

16:42.945 --> 16:44.819
A great psychologist.

16:44.989 --> 16:47.314
Why don't you try
being a woman for a change?

19:06.389 --> 19:07.421
Miranda.

19:08.892 --> 19:10.801
Where's Mr. Scott?

19:13.313 --> 19:14.476
Miranda?

19:16.066 --> 19:17.810
Miranda?

19:19.028 --> 19:22.314
Hey, there, Marvick,
so you couldn't resist a wee wager?

19:25.034 --> 19:26.991
Has the ambassador been hurt?

19:28.163 --> 19:30.488
No harm has come to the ambassador,
captain.

19:30.665 --> 19:32.741
Who could have done such a thing?

19:33.418 --> 19:35.292
Larry Marvick.

19:35.462 --> 19:37.918
Larry Marvick? Why?

19:39.675 --> 19:42.131
Do you know
whether he saw the Medusan?

19:42.303 --> 19:43.678
Yes, he did.

19:43.846 --> 19:46.633
Then insanity
will surely be the result, captain.

19:46.807 --> 19:48.599
Dangerous insanity.

19:48.768 --> 19:50.310
The controls are all yours.

19:50.478 --> 19:54.642
And the bottle of Scotch will be in your
room this evening if you handle them.

19:57.193 --> 19:59.685
Captain Kirk to all ship personnel.
Red alert.

19:59.863 --> 20:02.354
An attempt was made
to murder Kollos.

20:02.533 --> 20:04.739
The murderer is dangerously insane.

20:04.910 --> 20:09.371
He is Lawrence Marvick.
Be on the watch for him. Kirk out.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.484
Explain, Lieutenant Sulu?

20:44.577 --> 20:47.947
I don't believe this myself, captain,
but we're travelling warp factor 8.5.

20:48.123 --> 20:51.492
- And accelerating.
- Get Engineering, Uhura.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.712
They don't answer, captain.

21:03.681 --> 21:06.255
Warp factor 9 and accelerating.

21:06.434 --> 21:08.343
Can't you disengage power
from there, Mr. Spock?

21:08.520 --> 21:12.564
I'm trying, captain.
Mr. Chekov, your assistance, please.

21:14.735 --> 21:18.104
- Captain, I have Engineering now.
- Put them on intercom.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.736
We mustn't sleep! When you're
asleep, they come in your dreams!

21:20.908 --> 21:23.233
That's the worst.
They suffocate in your dreams.

21:23.410 --> 21:27.278
- We're making it out of here.
- Security to Engineering.

21:27.748 --> 21:29.955
- I'll go with you.
- No.

21:30.126 --> 21:31.917
I must. I can reach his mind.

21:38.593 --> 21:42.887
We'll be safe on the boundaries
of the universe. We'll be safe!

22:05.247 --> 22:08.331
- Scotty, where are we?
- I don't know.

22:08.500 --> 22:12.830
Beyond the boundaries of the galaxy.
We made it. We're safe.

22:13.005 --> 22:14.168
We're safe, Captain Kirk.

22:15.966 --> 22:17.840
- Bones.
- No.

22:18.010 --> 22:21.676
No. No, Captain.
We mustn't sleep. No. No.

22:21.848 --> 22:23.722
No, they come in your dreams.
That's the worst.

22:23.892 --> 22:25.516
They suffocate in your dreams.

22:25.685 --> 22:27.927
- No. No. No.
- All right.

22:28.104 --> 22:30.346
We'll take you to a place to hide.
Another place.

22:30.524 --> 22:31.555
- Come on.
- No. No.

22:31.733 --> 22:33.856
We must stay here with the controls.
Ready to speed!

22:34.027 --> 22:37.313
Speed. Speed to the next galaxy!

22:40.159 --> 22:41.653
Miranda.

22:41.827 --> 22:45.197
Miranda, you're here. With me.

22:47.041 --> 22:48.868
Yes, Larry.

22:50.712 --> 22:51.875
I'm here.

22:55.592 --> 22:57.632
I didn't lose you.

22:57.803 --> 23:00.638
Oh, my beautiful love,
I thought I'd lost you.

23:01.682 --> 23:03.390
I am here, Larry.

23:08.356 --> 23:11.061
No. I can see what he sees.

23:12.568 --> 23:13.897
No, don't.

23:14.696 --> 23:17.732
- Don't think of it.
- Liar. Liar.

23:17.908 --> 23:20.695
Deceiver. You're not alone.
You brought it with you. It's here.

23:20.869 --> 23:23.906
It's here. You brought it with you.

23:24.081 --> 23:26.489
Liar! Liar!

23:26.667 --> 23:28.660
Liar!

23:30.129 --> 23:33.083
Don't love her! Don't love her!

23:33.257 --> 23:35.546
She'll kill you if you love her!

23:39.097 --> 23:40.757
I love you, Miranda.

23:53.362 --> 23:55.319
He's dead, Jim.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.716
Captain's log, stardate 5630.8.

24:16.887 --> 24:19.841
As a result of
Larry Marvick's insane fears,

24:20.015 --> 24:23.965
the Enterprise lies derelict
in uncharted space.

24:24.145 --> 24:28.059
We have no way to determine
our position in relation to the galaxy.

24:28.233 --> 24:32.147
We are in
a completely unknown void.

24:36.533 --> 24:37.648
Where are we?

24:37.826 --> 24:40.448
We are evidently
far outside our own galaxy,

24:40.621 --> 24:43.076
judging from the lack of
traceable reference points.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.787
When we exceeded
warp-speed factor 9.5,

24:45.960 --> 24:49.080
we apparently entered
a space-time continuum.

24:49.255 --> 24:51.413
I have the autopsy report on Marvick.

24:51.591 --> 24:54.675
"Heart action stop: Cause unknown.
Respiration stop: Cause unknown.

24:54.844 --> 24:57.596
Brain activity stop: Cause..."
Shall I go on?

24:57.764 --> 24:59.673
You mean he just simply died?

25:00.350 --> 25:03.020
I mean he evidently
could not live with what he saw.

25:03.186 --> 25:05.096
Or what he felt.

25:05.355 --> 25:06.731
Damage report, Scotty.

25:06.899 --> 25:09.188
We need some repairs, sir,
but the ship is intact.

25:10.861 --> 25:13.779
- Position report, Mr. Spock.
- Impossible to calculate.

25:13.948 --> 25:15.822
We lack data to analyse.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.031
Our instruments appear to be
functioning normally,

25:18.202 --> 25:20.112
but what they tell us
makes no sense.

25:20.288 --> 25:23.871
Our records are clear up to the point
at which we left our galaxy.

25:24.793 --> 25:26.786
Then we should be able to
navigate back?

25:26.962 --> 25:30.746
Unfortunately, we lack reference
points on which to plot a return course.

25:30.924 --> 25:33.131
We experienced
extreme sensory distortion,

25:33.302 --> 25:36.801
and we shall do so again
if we attempt to use warp speed.

25:36.972 --> 25:39.890
And we cannot recross the barrier
using sub-light speed.

25:40.059 --> 25:42.218
A madman got us into this,

25:42.395 --> 25:45.681
and it's beginning to look as if
only a madman can get us out.

25:45.857 --> 25:49.725
An entertaining suggestion,
Mr. Chekov, but not very helpful.

25:49.903 --> 25:54.731
There is someone else aboard
who might be able to help us navigate.

25:54.908 --> 25:58.112
The Medusans have developed
interstellar navigation to a fine art.

25:58.287 --> 26:03.661
Could Kollos function
despite the sensory distortion?

26:03.834 --> 26:05.163
Very possibly.

26:05.336 --> 26:09.381
The Medusan's sensory system
is radically different from ours.

26:09.549 --> 26:15.173
Perhaps for the purpose of this
emergency, I might become Kollos.

26:15.764 --> 26:17.591
- Explain.
- A fusion.

26:17.766 --> 26:20.637
A mind-link to create a double entity.

26:20.811 --> 26:25.105
Each of us would enjoy the knowledge
and sensory capabilities of both.

26:25.274 --> 26:28.394
- We will function as one being.
- Hazards?

26:29.445 --> 26:34.238
If the link is successful, there will be
a tendency to lose separate identity.

26:34.826 --> 26:36.569
A necessary risk.

26:36.745 --> 26:39.450
Of course, Dr. Jones
will not wish to give me permission

26:39.623 --> 26:41.165
to accomplish the mind-link.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.993
I don't think
she'll want anyone to intrude

26:43.168 --> 26:45.457
in the kind of rapport
she has with Kollos.

26:45.629 --> 26:47.254
Dr. Jones has shown reluctance

26:47.423 --> 26:49.581
every time I've asked
to converse with Kollos.

26:50.176 --> 26:54.174
In some ways,
she is still most human, captain.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.636
Particularly
in the depth of her jealousy.

26:58.768 --> 27:01.722
- I could confine her to quarters.
- Not sufficient.

27:01.896 --> 27:04.269
Her telepathic powers
are formidable.

27:04.441 --> 27:07.857
If it is at all possible,
her mind must be so engaged

27:08.028 --> 27:11.148
that no thought
of what I am doing shall intrude.

27:11.323 --> 27:14.490
I think that could be arranged.

27:19.665 --> 27:23.414
I may be sentimental,
but this is my favourite place.

27:23.586 --> 27:24.997
Earth.

27:25.171 --> 27:27.330
I've never been to Earth.

27:28.758 --> 27:31.380
What lovely flowers.

27:31.553 --> 27:33.961
- May I touch them?
- Certainly.

27:49.155 --> 27:51.148
They have no scent.

27:51.533 --> 27:53.193
Try these.

28:05.548 --> 28:07.208
Let me see.

28:08.384 --> 28:10.460
It's just a thorn.

28:11.888 --> 28:15.886
I was hoping to make you
forget about this today.

28:16.059 --> 28:18.217
It doesn't hurt anymore.

28:21.815 --> 28:25.564
You mustn't blame yourself
because Marvick loved you.

28:26.612 --> 28:30.989
I didn't want his love.
I couldn't return it.

28:31.408 --> 28:36.747
Someday, you'll want human love
and companionship.

28:36.914 --> 28:39.915
Shall I tell you what
human companionship means to me?

28:40.084 --> 28:44.414
A struggle. A defence
against the emotions of others.

28:44.839 --> 28:47.757
At times,
the emotions burst in on me.

28:47.926 --> 28:51.924
Hatred, desire, envy, pity.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.090
Pity is the worst of all.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.936
I agree with the Vulcans.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.354
Violent emotion is a kind of insanity.

29:09.783 --> 29:12.737
You're willing to spend
the rest of your life with the Medusans

29:12.911 --> 29:15.449
in order to avoid human emotion?

29:15.622 --> 29:17.330
Perhaps.

29:18.250 --> 29:22.793
A meeting of minds is all very well,
but what about love, Miranda?

29:22.963 --> 29:24.672
You're young,

29:26.968 --> 29:28.628
attractive,

29:28.970 --> 29:30.595
and human.

29:31.473 --> 29:36.514
Sooner or later, no matter
how beautiful their minds are,

29:36.686 --> 29:38.975
you're going to yearn for someone
who looks like yourself.

29:39.147 --> 29:42.148
Someone who isn't ugly.

29:43.110 --> 29:44.569
Ugly?

29:44.737 --> 29:46.979
What is ugly?

29:47.156 --> 29:50.655
Who is to say whether
Kollos is too ugly to bear?

29:50.826 --> 29:53.199
Or too beautiful to bear?

29:54.580 --> 29:58.744
Miranda, I meant no insult. Please.

30:07.803 --> 30:13.224
Here we are among the roses.
A very romantic setting.

30:14.518 --> 30:17.057
I wish there were moonlight too.

30:17.522 --> 30:20.143
Moonlight would suit you very well.

30:21.901 --> 30:25.769
I see you're a very complicated man.

30:30.369 --> 30:33.370
- Kollos, no, you mustn't let him do it.
- Miranda. Miranda, don't.

30:33.539 --> 30:34.618
- Let me go.
- Miranda.

30:34.790 --> 30:38.159
No. You have no idea of what
a dangerous thing Spock is planning.

30:38.335 --> 30:40.328
We must stop him. Let me go!

30:52.225 --> 30:57.053
The Enterprise is at stake.
It is not possible for you to be involved.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.851
Why?

31:00.025 --> 31:01.603
I've already committed myself
to mind-link

31:01.777 --> 31:04.482
when Kollos and I
reach the Medusan vessel.

31:04.655 --> 31:05.770
Why put yourself in jeopardy?

31:05.948 --> 31:08.190
This is not a duty
that you can assume.

31:08.368 --> 31:11.155
I'm aware of the fact
that your telepathic competence

31:11.329 --> 31:13.203
might be superior to mine,

31:13.373 --> 31:15.698
but there is a more important factor.

31:15.876 --> 31:20.253
The object is to pilot this ship.
That is something you cannot do.

31:21.465 --> 31:25.415
Then teach me to operate the ship.
I can memorize instantly.

31:25.594 --> 31:27.338
Now, wait a minute.

31:27.888 --> 31:31.673
I realise you can do almost anything
a sighted person can,

31:31.851 --> 31:34.057
but you can't pilot a starship.

31:37.524 --> 31:39.101
What?

31:42.070 --> 31:44.027
Fascinating.

31:44.197 --> 31:48.112
I'm sorry, Miranda,
but you must be realistic.

31:48.368 --> 31:51.951
You are blind. And there are
some things you simply cannot do.

31:56.752 --> 32:00.287
Evidently, a highly
sophisticated sensor web.

32:00.506 --> 32:03.757
My compliments to you
and to your dressmaker.

32:03.927 --> 32:07.794
Yes, of course.
It's the only reasonable explanation.

32:07.973 --> 32:12.137
You can't see,
and Kollos can't hurt you.

32:12.311 --> 32:14.138
An elegant solution.

32:14.313 --> 32:16.021
But I fail to understand

32:16.190 --> 32:20.567
why you apparently tried to conceal
your blindness, Dr. Jones.

32:20.736 --> 32:22.646
I think I understand.

32:23.614 --> 32:29.155
You said that pity is the worst of all.

32:29.621 --> 32:31.032
Pity.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.997
Which I hate.

32:36.587 --> 32:39.078
Do you think you can gather
more information with your eyes

32:39.256 --> 32:41.830
than I can with my sensors?

32:42.259 --> 32:45.011
I could play tennis with you,
Captain Kirk.

32:45.179 --> 32:47.088
I might even beat you.

32:47.265 --> 32:52.805
I am standing exactly one meter,
four centimetres, from the door.

32:52.979 --> 32:55.814
Can you judge distance
that accurately?

32:56.441 --> 32:59.775
I can even tell you
how fast your heart is beating.

33:00.654 --> 33:02.979
Oh, that won't be necessary.

33:03.699 --> 33:07.483
Mr. Spock will make the mind-link.
No other decision is possible.

33:08.037 --> 33:10.824
No. I won't let you.

33:10.998 --> 33:12.374
Please.

33:12.542 --> 33:15.033
Do not fight us like this, Dr. Jones.

33:15.211 --> 33:18.663
I appeal to you as a colleague.
Do not oppose us.

33:18.840 --> 33:19.955
No.

33:20.133 --> 33:23.716
If we can't persuade you,
there is someone who can.

33:23.887 --> 33:25.880
You'll have to
take this up with Kollos.

33:28.225 --> 33:29.850
For your own sake.

33:56.881 --> 33:59.372
Bones, why hadn't you told me?

33:59.550 --> 34:02.337
She would have told you herself
if she'd wanted you to know.

34:02.512 --> 34:04.054
I respect her privacy.

34:04.222 --> 34:07.638
Yes, there's a great deal to respect
about that lady.

34:17.402 --> 34:20.937
It seems I have no choice
but to obey you.

34:24.702 --> 34:26.445
Captain's log, supplementary.

34:26.621 --> 34:28.946
Our one chance
to return to our own galaxy

34:29.123 --> 34:31.793
is dependant upon
the navigational skills

34:31.960 --> 34:33.536
of the Medusan ambassador.

34:33.710 --> 34:34.992
Without him in view,

34:35.170 --> 34:40.795
Kollos has been brought to the Bridge
and placed behind a protective shield.

35:34.401 --> 35:35.943
This is delightful.

35:38.113 --> 35:41.814
I know you. All of you.

35:42.869 --> 35:47.614
James Kirk,
captain and friend for many years.

35:47.790 --> 35:52.868
And Leonard McCoy,
also of long acquaintance.

35:53.046 --> 35:57.543
And Uhura,
whose name means freedom.

35:57.718 --> 36:00.125
"She walks in beauty, like the night."

36:00.304 --> 36:01.846
That's not Spock.

36:02.014 --> 36:04.505
Are you surprised to find
that I've read Byron, doctor?

36:04.683 --> 36:06.475
That's Spock.

36:07.311 --> 36:09.719
Am I addressing the ambassador?

36:10.440 --> 36:11.471
In part.

36:11.649 --> 36:15.065
That is, part of us
is known to you as Kollos.

36:19.366 --> 36:21.240
Miranda.

36:22.911 --> 36:24.571
There you are.

36:26.165 --> 36:29.249
Oh, brave new world
that has such creatures in it.

36:30.586 --> 36:32.080
'Tis new to thee.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.669
My world is next for us.

36:45.227 --> 36:46.602
Captain Kirk.

36:46.770 --> 36:48.644
I speak for all of us
you call Medusans.

36:48.814 --> 36:51.435
I am sorry for the trouble
I've brought to your ship.

36:51.942 --> 36:53.686
We don't hold you to blame
for what happened,

36:53.861 --> 36:55.403
and thank you now for your help.

36:55.988 --> 36:58.444
And now to the business at hand.

36:58.616 --> 37:00.075
With your permission, captain.

37:00.243 --> 37:02.734
Yes. Mr. Sulu,
release the helm to Mr. Spock.

37:02.912 --> 37:04.537
Aye, sir.

37:21.432 --> 37:23.092
Coordination is completed.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.471
Then go ahead, Mr. Spock.

37:27.647 --> 37:30.731
Warp 1 in six seconds.

37:30.984 --> 37:34.270
Five, four, three,

37:34.446 --> 37:36.902
two, one, zero.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.410
Position report, please, Mr. Chekov.

38:23.582 --> 38:25.539
Our position?

38:28.545 --> 38:33.089
Our position is so close to the point
where we entered the void,

38:33.259 --> 38:35.666
the difference isn't worth mentioning.

38:37.889 --> 38:41.055
- Bull's-eye, Mr. Spock.
- Thank you, Mr. Chekov.

38:41.225 --> 38:44.096
- Manoeuvre completed, captain.
- Take over, Mr. Sulu.

38:44.270 --> 38:46.726
Thank you, ambassador.

38:46.898 --> 38:49.306
Mr. Chekov, plot a new course.

38:49.484 --> 38:52.604
New headings
will be plotted in a minute, sir.

38:58.202 --> 39:00.907
How compact your bodies are.

39:02.415 --> 39:05.250
What a variety of senses you have.

39:06.127 --> 39:09.876
This thing you call language, though.

39:10.090 --> 39:15.962
Most remarkable.
You depend on it for so very much.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.307
But is any one of you
really its master?

39:21.810 --> 39:25.760
But most of all, the aloneness.

39:27.566 --> 39:30.236
You are so alone.

39:30.695 --> 39:36.034
You live out your lives
in this shell of flesh.

39:36.618 --> 39:40.912
Self-contained, separate.

39:42.332 --> 39:45.120
How lonely you are.

39:45.794 --> 39:47.787
How terribly lonely.

39:47.963 --> 39:49.671
Ambassador.

39:55.763 --> 39:57.341
You must dissolve the link.

39:59.642 --> 40:01.434
So soon?

40:04.189 --> 40:05.517
There must be no delay.

40:09.069 --> 40:11.145
You're a wise captain.

40:37.433 --> 40:39.057
Captain.

40:39.226 --> 40:40.389
Spock!

40:40.561 --> 40:43.598
Don't look! Cover your eyes!

41:01.834 --> 41:03.708
- Don't move.
- Jim.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.704
No one is to move.

41:10.176 --> 41:12.928
Spock, are you all right?

41:34.952 --> 41:35.984
Spock?

41:37.914 --> 41:39.705
It's all right.

41:40.875 --> 41:43.283
You're safe with us now.

42:13.368 --> 42:16.987
He's hardly breathing.
Help me get him to Sickbay.

42:23.504 --> 42:27.632
Unless Miranda can look down
into his mind and turn it outward to us,

42:27.800 --> 42:29.081
we'll lose Spock.

42:29.260 --> 42:32.380
Vulcan mind techniques,
they seem so untrustworthy

42:32.555 --> 42:35.225
- now that Spock's life is at stake.
- Her knowledge of it

42:35.392 --> 42:37.468
may be the only thing
that could save Spock's sanity,

42:37.644 --> 42:39.933
perhaps even his own life.

42:40.397 --> 42:42.437
But does she want to?

42:45.361 --> 42:49.062
- She's been in there so long.
- There's nothing else to be done.

42:49.240 --> 42:51.114
She tried to help Marvick,
and Marvick is dead.

42:51.284 --> 42:53.241
That's different. Marvick loved her.

42:54.120 --> 42:58.118
And Spock is her rival.
Is that any better?

42:58.291 --> 43:00.913
Even Spock felt the violence
of her jealousy.

43:01.086 --> 43:03.577
But they weren't rivals in love.

43:05.132 --> 43:06.295
Jim.

43:08.636 --> 43:09.798
You shouldn't go in there.

43:09.970 --> 43:13.470
Whatever happens, Bones,
don't interfere.

43:21.649 --> 43:23.227
Who is it?

43:23.652 --> 43:25.561
Dr. McCoy?

43:28.323 --> 43:29.652
Who's there?

43:35.331 --> 43:36.493
Captain Kirk.

43:39.710 --> 43:42.546
I have no news for you, captain.

43:44.674 --> 43:46.334
No change?

43:47.260 --> 43:50.510
Only that his life
processes are ebbing.

43:50.680 --> 43:54.892
- What are you doing about it?
- Well, what I can, of course.

43:55.060 --> 43:57.219
Which doesn't seem to be much.

43:57.688 --> 44:00.179
No doubt you think
I can wake him with a kiss?

44:00.357 --> 44:03.358
It's worth a try, isn't it?
After all, he's not a machine.

44:03.527 --> 44:04.772
But he is a Vulcan.

44:04.946 --> 44:08.362
Only half, the other half is human.
Far more human than you, apparently.

44:09.117 --> 44:11.738
Face reality, captain.

44:11.911 --> 44:14.912
His mind has gone down
almost too far even for me to reach.

44:15.081 --> 44:19.542
If you don't reach him soon, he'll die.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.921
- But that's what you want, isn't it?
- That's a lie.

44:23.090 --> 44:26.174
Oh, yes, it is. You want him to die.
What did you do to him on the Bridge?

44:26.343 --> 44:28.051
Make him forget
to put the visor over his eyes?

44:28.220 --> 44:31.387
- You're insane.
- Yes, you know your rival, don't you?

44:31.557 --> 44:33.846
You couldn't keep him
from making a mind-link with Kollos,

44:34.018 --> 44:37.055
something that
you couldn't do yourself.

44:37.522 --> 44:42.101
With my words,
I'll make you hear such ugliness.

44:42.277 --> 44:45.148
What Spock saw when he looked
at Kollos with his naked eyes.

44:45.322 --> 44:48.738
- The ugliness is within you.
- That's a lie! Liar!

44:48.909 --> 44:50.985
Your passion
to see Kollos is madness.

44:51.162 --> 44:53.700
You can never see, never.

44:54.498 --> 44:57.120
But Spock saw Kollos.

44:57.335 --> 45:01.463
- And for that, he must die.
- Sadistic, filthy liar!

45:01.631 --> 45:04.003
The smell of hatred,
the stench of jealousy permeates you.

45:04.175 --> 45:06.002
Why don't you strangle him
while he lies there?

45:06.178 --> 45:09.262
- Don't say anymore, please!
- Kollos knows what's in your heart.

45:09.431 --> 45:12.136
You can lie to yourself,
but you can't lie to Kollos.

45:12.309 --> 45:14.681
Please, go away.

45:29.411 --> 45:31.949
- What did you say to her?
- Maybe too much.

45:32.122 --> 45:34.198
What's she doing in there?

45:34.374 --> 45:36.830
You may be right, Bones,
maybe I shouldn't have gone in.

45:37.002 --> 45:41.296
She was blind, really blind,
really in the dark.

45:41.465 --> 45:43.541
And if he dies...

45:43.718 --> 45:48.131
If he dies, how do I know
that I didn't kill him?

45:48.306 --> 45:51.307
How do I know
that she can stand to hear the truth?

46:02.404 --> 46:06.651
Now, Spock, this is to the death.

46:06.826 --> 46:09.696
Or to life for both of us.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.641
Spock.

47:19.320 --> 47:21.561
You look like you've paid a visit
to the devil himself.

47:21.739 --> 47:23.482
Miranda.

47:43.929 --> 47:48.057
- You have what you wanted most?
- I am one with Kollos.

47:48.225 --> 47:50.551
Well, I'm truly sorry
that you're leaving.

47:50.728 --> 47:52.270
Goodbye.

47:56.276 --> 47:59.111
We've come to the end
of an eventful trip, captain.

47:59.279 --> 48:00.738
I didn't think you'd even talk to me.

48:01.948 --> 48:03.573
I have you to thank for my future.

48:05.285 --> 48:06.614
Your words enabled me to see.

48:07.871 --> 48:11.786
Miranda, good luck, health.

48:11.959 --> 48:13.537
I have something for you.

48:16.923 --> 48:19.248
I suppose it has thorns.

48:19.425 --> 48:21.133
I never met a rose that didn't.

48:32.272 --> 48:36.981
I know now the great joy you felt
when you joined minds with Kollos.

48:37.278 --> 48:40.978
I rejoice in your knowledge
and in your achievement.

48:42.909 --> 48:45.151
I understand, Mr. Spock.

48:45.328 --> 48:49.326
The glory of creation
is in its infinite diversity.

48:49.499 --> 48:55.170
And the ways our differences combine
to create meaning and beauty.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.929
Peace and long life, Spock.

49:07.602 --> 49:10.354
Live long and prosper, Miranda.

49:14.109 --> 49:15.271
Peace.
