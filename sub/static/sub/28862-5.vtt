WEBVTT

03:07.755 --> 03:11.338
Is it not peculiar
that one feels the greatest aversion

03:12.005 --> 03:15.422
towards the very people
who are most similar to oneself?

03:17.797 --> 03:19.922
I want to know how to get back home.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.380
Get dressed.

04:00.755 --> 04:02.755
JUNE 25, 2020

04:02.838 --> 04:06.422
TWO DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

04:37.922 --> 04:39.255
Wait.

04:47.297 --> 04:49.463
I have to show you something.

04:49.547 --> 04:51.005
We've got an appointment.

04:51.755 --> 04:53.213
Maybe you'd better sit down.

04:53.297 --> 04:56.338
Can we do this some other time?
We really have to go.

04:57.838 --> 04:59.255
It's... I...

04:59.963 --> 05:01.422
I have to tell you something.

05:01.963 --> 05:05.338
It sounds totally crazy, but I have
to know what you think about it.

05:05.422 --> 05:06.963
Are you nuts?

05:07.547 --> 05:11.422
You've hardly spoken to us in months
and now you want to know what we think?

05:12.338 --> 05:13.630
Look around you.

05:14.713 --> 05:18.422
We're the kids, but you've been acting
like one for months.

05:18.505 --> 05:21.880
Mom,
you act as if you're alone with this shit.

05:23.963 --> 05:25.880
But we lost them too.

05:32.547 --> 05:33.547
No.

05:34.588 --> 05:36.880
So you want to talk,
that doesn't mean we do!

05:48.797 --> 05:51.588
<i>Why is he so interested</i>
<i>in the nuclear power plant?</i>

05:53.380 --> 05:56.880
Find someone at Criminal Investigation
who knows this Clausen guy.

05:56.963 --> 05:58.797
What does he really want here?

06:00.505 --> 06:02.755
Call me as soon as you know something.

06:07.797 --> 06:09.463
Bartosz isn't here.

06:13.255 --> 06:16.880
His bed hasn't been slept in.
He wasn't here all night.

06:18.338 --> 06:21.463
-Maybe he's with Martha.
-They're not together anymore.

06:22.422 --> 06:25.130
They must've made up. Have you called?

06:25.213 --> 06:26.963
No one's answering.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.297
I'm sure it's nothing.

06:33.213 --> 06:34.922
Tell me it'll all be fine.

06:44.463 --> 06:45.838
It'll all be fine.

07:10.463 --> 07:11.963
You good, Inspector?

07:24.255 --> 07:26.380
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
EGON TIEDEMANN

07:26.463 --> 07:27.755
FOUND DEAD ON JUNE 26, 1987

07:30.547 --> 07:33.463
CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING HIS DEATH STILL UNCLEAR

07:37.797 --> 07:39.088
Ms. Tiedemann?

07:40.130 --> 07:41.880
The French delegation.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.880
They're all waiting.
I think you'd better get going.

07:49.047 --> 07:50.172
Reschedule.

07:50.672 --> 07:51.547
What?

08:00.463 --> 08:01.547
Reschedule.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.005
But I can't just...

08:26.963 --> 08:28.422
Why am I here?

08:33.297 --> 08:36.463
A person lives three lives.

08:37.297 --> 08:40.297
The first ends with the loss of naïveté,

08:40.755 --> 08:43.422
the second with the loss of innocence,

08:44.130 --> 08:48.130
and the third
with the loss of life itself.

08:50.088 --> 08:53.922
It is inevitable
that we go through all three stages.

08:55.588 --> 08:58.422
You will turn into your older self,

08:59.047 --> 09:00.713
and your older self

09:01.380 --> 09:03.755
into what you see before you.

09:04.088 --> 09:05.963
I don't have time for this shit.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.005
I have to go back home. To my time!

09:09.797 --> 09:12.422
I've seen what will happen.
I've seen their graves.

09:13.755 --> 09:15.380
You still have lots of time.

09:16.755 --> 09:19.213
This is the year 1921.

09:20.963 --> 09:24.713
Strictly speaking,
you still have 99 years.

09:33.713 --> 09:36.088
Here. A fresh snack.

09:40.463 --> 09:42.047
People can say what they like,

09:43.005 --> 09:45.838
but Reagan is a first-rate guy.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.547
The Olympic Games in East and West Berlin.

09:50.630 --> 09:52.297
I call that visionary.

09:52.838 --> 09:55.130
I have the whole speech on VHS.

10:23.588 --> 10:25.672
<i>You haven't been here in a long time.</i>

10:29.588 --> 10:31.838
I just wanted
to quickly check how you are.

10:35.130 --> 10:36.380
It's fine.

10:43.547 --> 10:44.838
Claudia.

10:49.130 --> 10:51.172
You do know that I'm proud.

10:54.588 --> 10:56.630
Of all you've accomplished.

11:00.797 --> 11:03.130
And your mother would be, too.

11:07.880 --> 11:09.422
I've got to go.

11:16.213 --> 11:18.130
The real reason I came...

11:20.255 --> 11:21.963
I want you to move in with us.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.922
You wouldn't be so alone.

11:26.338 --> 11:28.797
And Regina would be happy
to see more of you.

11:31.088 --> 11:32.630
Tomorrow would be best.

11:34.838 --> 11:36.255
Tomorrow?

11:37.422 --> 11:40.922
You're acting
like I'm almost on my deathbed.

11:45.255 --> 11:46.755
Think it over.

11:48.672 --> 11:49.755
All right?

12:19.505 --> 12:20.713
Katharina?

12:21.380 --> 12:22.713
What do you want?

12:25.380 --> 12:26.630
Is he here?

12:28.255 --> 12:29.380
Jonas?

12:29.880 --> 12:32.713
He has vanished.
I have no idea where he is.

12:35.297 --> 12:36.713
You said you saw Mikkel.

12:37.963 --> 12:40.838
You were there. How do I get to him?

12:47.047 --> 12:49.213
He has this kind of...

12:49.297 --> 12:50.380
device.

12:51.547 --> 12:53.172
I guess it's like a...

12:54.172 --> 12:55.588
time machine.

12:58.838 --> 13:00.130
A time machine.

13:01.463 --> 13:03.130
And do you know how it works?

13:04.255 --> 13:06.255
Even if I did, it wouldn't help.

13:07.297 --> 13:08.380
He took it.

13:20.922 --> 13:22.380
He was always here.

13:24.338 --> 13:25.922
Right in front of me.

13:31.338 --> 13:35.338
I just can't believe you slept
with my husband and my son.

13:37.130 --> 13:40.047
But you always did want
what belonged to me.

13:41.422 --> 13:43.088
You're like a parasite.

13:45.672 --> 13:48.255
Did Ulrich ever actually tell you
he loved you?

13:50.422 --> 13:53.297
In the end, he would always choose us.

14:06.797 --> 14:07.672
Hello.

14:08.297 --> 14:09.297
Hello.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.338
You missed your appointment yesterday.

14:12.463 --> 14:14.380
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

14:14.463 --> 14:16.422
must have forgotten.

14:16.505 --> 14:19.838
Hard to believe you'd forget it
when your own child is missing.

14:20.880 --> 14:22.088
Mrs. Nielsen.

14:23.463 --> 14:26.047
You were the last person
I expected to see here.

14:28.005 --> 14:29.588
But since you're here...

14:33.838 --> 14:35.297
Do you know who this is?

14:37.297 --> 14:38.463
No, I don't.

14:59.005 --> 15:00.213
And you?

15:07.463 --> 15:08.963
Do you know this person?

15:14.005 --> 15:15.047
No.

16:39.505 --> 16:41.380
<i>Do you know everything that will happen?</i>

16:42.963 --> 16:45.422
I know when wars begin and end,

16:47.172 --> 16:50.547
what discoveries will be made
in the years ahead,

16:52.088 --> 16:54.005
what shares I should invest in.

16:55.963 --> 16:58.588
But I don't know
what my counterpart will do

16:59.755 --> 17:02.338
as long as I haven't seen his future.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.755
But you know my future.
You know what I'll do.

17:07.297 --> 17:09.213
I am your future.

17:12.380 --> 17:16.255
There must be a way to change it all.
So things happen differently.

17:17.088 --> 17:18.297
A loophole.

17:20.422 --> 17:24.338
It took me 66 years to find out how,

17:25.255 --> 17:27.880
to find a way to escape this hell.

17:33.463 --> 17:34.922
I've been here almost a week.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.755
And I get the impression
no one is telling the truth.

17:40.672 --> 17:42.672
Everyone's trying to hide something.

17:44.297 --> 17:47.380
Although I'm not sure
if you're all hiding the same thing

17:47.463 --> 17:51.297
or if everyone is trying
to keep their own skeleton in the closet.

17:57.922 --> 17:58.922
Does he pay you?

18:03.838 --> 18:05.172
Aleksander Tiedemann.

18:07.213 --> 18:08.797
I don't quite follow you.

18:09.797 --> 18:14.047
You worked as his physiotherapist.
You no longer do so, right?

18:17.297 --> 18:20.713
Yet he still transfers you
the same amount every month.

18:21.713 --> 18:25.505
One would normally expect
a service in return, so what is it?

18:35.380 --> 18:37.672
What you don't get is
we stick together here.

18:39.297 --> 18:40.755
We support each other.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.755
My son disappeared.

18:47.297 --> 18:49.255
Aleksander helps me with the money.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.130
That's it.

18:55.047 --> 18:57.297
Nothing beats a good neighborhood.

19:00.005 --> 19:04.255
It's remarkable that Mrs. Nielsen
feels the same way about that.

19:06.672 --> 19:09.588
Oh, well,
maybe that's how small towns are.

19:10.630 --> 19:12.630
People share not only secrets,

19:15.588 --> 19:17.047
but also money and beds.

19:53.963 --> 19:56.547
-<i>I want to know what you know.</i>
-<i>Fine.</i>

19:57.380 --> 19:59.088
Who is Noah?

19:59.880 --> 20:01.297
He's one of them.

20:02.672 --> 20:03.880
A traveler.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.338
He's Adam's puppet.

20:09.297 --> 20:10.505
He killed the children.

20:12.088 --> 20:14.130
Mads, Erik, Yasin.

20:22.005 --> 20:23.047
I think

20:23.630 --> 20:26.047
all of this has to do with me.

20:29.672 --> 20:31.630
Do you know who my parents are?

20:34.838 --> 20:35.880
No.

20:38.755 --> 20:40.547
But I knew your grandfather.

20:42.047 --> 20:44.088
He's not my real grandfather.

20:44.755 --> 20:46.463
I just grew up with him.

20:50.338 --> 20:51.672
Did he know all this?

20:54.380 --> 20:55.963
Is he one of them?

20:57.463 --> 20:58.463
A traveler?

20:59.463 --> 21:01.880
He's just a pawn, like most of us.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.088
Claudia.

21:06.172 --> 21:07.588
She used him.

21:08.213 --> 21:10.672
Just like she used me, Peter
and the others.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.130
She had him build this.

21:35.255 --> 21:36.838
You know what will happen.

21:37.588 --> 21:38.838
In the future.

21:39.213 --> 21:40.255
Yes.

22:03.713 --> 22:04.963
What is this?

22:08.880 --> 22:10.338
Want to spend another night here?

22:11.630 --> 22:14.172
Man, Bartosz, look at us.
What are we doing here?

22:15.880 --> 22:17.838
Why won't you tell us what's going on?

22:17.922 --> 22:19.922
I would if I could.

22:21.588 --> 22:23.213
I'm not allowed to.

22:23.297 --> 22:26.755
Even if I did tell you,
you wouldn't believe me.

22:26.838 --> 22:28.338
Why not?

22:29.672 --> 22:33.088
The human body
can go three days without liquid.

22:41.255 --> 22:43.630
You're nuts. You can't do this!

22:45.505 --> 22:47.922
You want to leave me here to die or what?

22:48.797 --> 22:49.880
Hey, Martha.

22:49.963 --> 22:52.755
Martha, wait. Please.
Martha, you can't do this!

22:52.838 --> 22:53.922
Martha!

22:54.505 --> 22:55.630
Okay.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.422
It's a time machine.

23:06.380 --> 23:07.505
What?

23:10.713 --> 23:12.297
Are you screwing with me?

23:13.505 --> 23:15.630
I said you wouldn't believe me.

23:17.838 --> 23:19.797
Come on. We're leaving.

23:20.130 --> 23:21.338
No. Wait.

23:26.047 --> 23:27.547
Then show us how it works.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.130
I need a phone.

23:45.338 --> 23:48.297
-There's no reception here.
-That's irrelevant.

23:49.588 --> 23:51.963
It just needs
to search for a signal, that's it.

24:01.130 --> 24:03.213
ARIADNE

24:18.880 --> 24:20.463
You need to come closer.

24:35.422 --> 24:37.005
<i>The incident last summer.</i>

24:38.255 --> 24:42.297
You told me it was from a reaction
in the volume control system.

24:43.922 --> 24:45.505
I checked the data.

24:45.588 --> 24:47.297
Everything was normal.

24:48.547 --> 24:49.547
So...

24:51.630 --> 24:53.422
What really happened?

24:58.672 --> 25:02.130
I knew you wouldn't be able
to let it rest.

25:05.213 --> 25:09.463
After the incident
I had a sample taken and analyzed.

25:09.547 --> 25:12.005
What you see there are the results.

25:18.588 --> 25:21.130
These values, they aren't possible.

25:21.213 --> 25:23.213
I initially thought that too.

25:23.630 --> 25:26.213
So I had the tests repeated.

25:26.297 --> 25:28.088
The results were identical.

25:29.088 --> 25:30.755
If this data is correct, then...

25:31.630 --> 25:33.797
-Is this what I think it is?
-Possibly.

25:34.380 --> 25:37.172
In many respects it corresponds

25:37.255 --> 25:40.088
to Englert, Brout
and Higgs' calculations in 1964.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.672
But not entirely.

25:43.630 --> 25:45.088
The God Particle.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.755
The particle
that gives all things its mass.

25:51.880 --> 25:53.630
This is a sensation.

25:57.755 --> 26:00.172
If this data is correct,
we have to go public with it.

26:01.547 --> 26:03.172
I already told you

26:04.338 --> 26:07.380
some sleeping dogs should be left to lie.

26:10.213 --> 26:14.047
If we go public with it
people will want to know how we found it.

26:16.963 --> 26:18.338
The nuclear power plant

26:19.088 --> 26:21.130
is my legacy.

26:22.838 --> 26:25.005
Do what you like with the data,

26:26.005 --> 26:28.255
but leave my name

26:28.880 --> 26:30.672
and the power plant out of it.

26:31.755 --> 26:33.797
At least as long as I'm alive.

27:04.338 --> 27:05.797
Can I help you?

27:09.922 --> 27:11.338
Are you not well?

27:46.088 --> 27:47.713
-Hello, Ines.
-Ina!

27:47.797 --> 27:48.963
Hello.

27:49.880 --> 27:51.838
We're out of iodine again.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.130
Have you heard?

27:56.172 --> 27:57.922
A guy escaped from the loony bin.

27:58.505 --> 28:02.130
They say he killed two kids in the 1950s,
and beat another half to death.

28:02.797 --> 28:06.755
He's on his last legs himself now,
but they say to be vigilant.

28:25.922 --> 28:26.755
Thanks.

28:48.922 --> 28:51.130
You seem familiar somehow.

29:03.838 --> 29:07.047
I've waited over 33 years for this moment.

29:22.505 --> 29:24.338
The question is not how,

29:25.713 --> 29:26.547
but when.

29:29.088 --> 29:30.505
You said that.

29:32.963 --> 29:33.963
Remember?

29:44.922 --> 29:46.005
Dad.

29:50.422 --> 29:53.088
<i>In the future</i>
<i>there's a prophecy about a new world.</i>

29:54.505 --> 29:56.922
That Sic Mundus
will lead people into paradise.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.713
Is this that?

30:02.505 --> 30:03.713
A religion?

30:04.838 --> 30:07.088
We're the exact opposite of that.

30:08.463 --> 30:10.713
We've declared war on time.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.755
Declared war on God.

30:15.505 --> 30:17.547
We're creating a new world,

30:18.338 --> 30:19.547
without time,

30:20.255 --> 30:21.380
without God.

30:23.213 --> 30:24.297
What does that mean?

30:25.547 --> 30:29.963
It means that what people
have worshipped for millennia,

30:30.047 --> 30:32.338
the God who holds everything together,

30:32.422 --> 30:36.047
that God is nothing more than time itself.

30:37.005 --> 30:39.630
Not a thinking, acting entity.

30:39.713 --> 30:42.088
A physical law

30:42.172 --> 30:45.963
with which one can negotiate
as little as one can with one's own fate.

30:47.505 --> 30:48.338
God

30:49.338 --> 30:50.588
is time.

30:52.713 --> 30:54.672
And time is not merciful.

30:55.963 --> 30:59.880
We are born,
and our life is already trickling away

30:59.963 --> 31:01.630
like the sand in this hourglass.

31:01.713 --> 31:04.088
Death is forever inevitably before us.

31:04.713 --> 31:05.797
Our fate

31:06.505 --> 31:10.088
is nothing
but a concatenation of cause and effect.

31:11.713 --> 31:12.838
In light

31:13.755 --> 31:15.047
and in shadow.

32:15.047 --> 32:16.255
Charlotte.

32:23.963 --> 32:25.088
What do you want?

32:32.005 --> 32:34.505
-I'm Noah.
-I know who you are.

32:39.088 --> 32:40.713
You killed the children.

32:47.047 --> 32:49.922
I can no longer change
what you think of me.

32:51.005 --> 32:51.880
But...

32:53.880 --> 32:56.422
maybe one day you'll understand

32:56.505 --> 33:00.755
that I only did this
so that it will one day no longer happen.

33:05.547 --> 33:07.880
So you're not taken from me again.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.588
And neither is your mother.

33:21.713 --> 33:24.880
When you were born
they didn't give you much of a chance.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.588
You were premature. You were tiny.

33:30.297 --> 33:32.838
But you wanted to live.
You were so strong.

33:35.338 --> 33:38.463
Your little hand grasped my finger
and wouldn't let go.

33:38.547 --> 33:39.630
Stop.

33:42.047 --> 33:43.713
That's impossible.

33:51.297 --> 33:53.130
Your mother took that picture.

33:56.672 --> 33:59.047
I promised her I'd bring you back.

34:01.422 --> 34:03.255
I've looked for you all these years.

34:04.797 --> 34:07.422
But you were here the entire time.

34:10.922 --> 34:12.963
Adam knew it was you.

34:15.463 --> 34:17.422
He knew it all the time.

34:18.713 --> 34:21.047
He's preparing for what comes afterwards.

34:22.547 --> 34:24.630
I read the last pages.

34:25.922 --> 34:28.088
The nuclear power plant, Jonas.

34:28.172 --> 34:30.130
It'll all happen again. The apocalypse.

34:31.338 --> 34:32.463
In two days.

34:33.213 --> 34:34.630
But I now know

34:36.005 --> 34:37.463
what I must do.

34:42.005 --> 34:43.547
I have to end Adam.

34:43.630 --> 34:44.880
So everyone lives.

34:48.172 --> 34:49.838
Not just those in the bunker.

34:56.005 --> 34:57.547
Who is my mother?

35:07.672 --> 35:09.338
She loved you very much.

35:13.255 --> 35:14.963
She still does.

35:53.463 --> 35:54.880
What happened here?

36:05.213 --> 36:06.672
The armchair is gone.

36:07.505 --> 36:10.755
-What's going on?
-I didn't believe it at first either.

36:11.380 --> 36:14.088
But then he told me things
that would happen.

36:15.672 --> 36:17.672
And they did, just as he said.

36:20.380 --> 36:21.380
That...

36:22.713 --> 36:24.422
you and Jonas kissed.

36:25.630 --> 36:28.088
He told me that before you did it.

36:29.047 --> 36:30.630
That my mother would get cancer.

36:32.630 --> 36:34.088
That Jonas would vanish.

36:35.255 --> 36:36.880
Who told you that?

36:39.630 --> 36:40.547
Noah.

36:40.797 --> 36:41.713
Noah?

36:42.547 --> 36:44.380
The priest with the big blue eyes?

36:45.005 --> 36:46.713
-You know him?
-I don't.

36:46.797 --> 36:47.963
But Elisabeth does.

36:48.380 --> 36:50.630
Okay, what's going on?

36:51.338 --> 36:53.130
Noah said it was about a war.

36:54.422 --> 36:56.213
And about ruling over time.

36:57.338 --> 37:01.130
That my grandma is involved in it
and that Jonas will return and...

37:01.213 --> 37:02.088
Jonas?

37:04.380 --> 37:05.713
Jonas is coming back?

37:06.755 --> 37:08.172
Yes.

37:08.255 --> 37:09.713
He's part of the war.

37:13.047 --> 37:14.630
I'm going home.

37:19.088 --> 37:20.422
You have to believe me.

37:33.588 --> 37:34.797
Michael?

37:36.630 --> 37:37.797
Michael?

37:49.463 --> 37:50.505
Michael?

37:58.963 --> 38:01.047
Egon, it's Ines.

38:01.130 --> 38:03.588
I know it sounds strange, but...

38:03.672 --> 38:06.922
I just got home
and Michael isn't here and...

38:08.422 --> 38:11.338
The man who broke out
of the psychiatric ward...

38:12.130 --> 38:13.838
Which man from the psychiatric ward?

38:13.922 --> 38:16.005
It was on the radio today.

38:16.713 --> 38:17.963
Do you remember

38:18.713 --> 38:21.672
the children
on the construction site in 1953?

38:22.422 --> 38:24.213
That man, he escaped.

38:25.172 --> 38:27.547
I'll call the police station at once.

38:27.630 --> 38:29.463
<i>I might know where they're heading.</i>

38:30.172 --> 38:31.588
<i>I'll come pick you up.</i>

39:01.047 --> 39:02.880
Stop! Freeze!

39:02.963 --> 39:04.922
-Michael!
-Let the boy go!

39:05.422 --> 39:06.922
-No!
-Get on the ground!

39:07.005 --> 39:07.880
Michael!

39:07.963 --> 39:10.088
-You don't get it!
-Get down!

39:10.172 --> 39:12.338
-He's my son.
-I said get down now!

39:16.130 --> 39:18.005
-Mikkel.
-Michael! Michael.

39:18.088 --> 39:21.672
Mikkel, I'll be back. I'll take you home.

39:22.172 --> 39:23.588
I promise.

39:23.672 --> 39:24.672
I promise.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.130
It's all your fault. It always has been.

39:29.213 --> 39:32.297
I swear, next time I'll kill you.

39:33.005 --> 39:34.297
Come on!

39:34.880 --> 39:36.130
Mikkel!

39:41.963 --> 39:42.963
Mikkel.

39:43.588 --> 39:44.880
Michael.

39:44.963 --> 39:46.005
Our father

39:46.422 --> 39:48.880
is just a small part of a knot

39:49.463 --> 39:52.922
that is infinitely larger
and more convoluted.

39:54.255 --> 39:55.922
The entire universe

39:56.005 --> 39:59.838
is nothing but a gigantic knot
from which there is no escape.

40:01.130 --> 40:02.422
If that's so,

40:03.630 --> 40:06.047
if everything is perpetually in that knot,

40:06.547 --> 40:08.088
if nothing can be changed,

40:09.838 --> 40:11.838
then you've already had this conversation?

40:11.922 --> 40:14.422
And posed that very question.

40:16.172 --> 40:18.713
My whole life, I was convinced

40:19.838 --> 40:21.422
that this moment

40:22.005 --> 40:24.672
could never be repeated in this way.

40:25.630 --> 40:27.755
I could never speak the words

40:28.547 --> 40:31.672
that my older self said to me back then.

40:34.672 --> 40:36.672
Because I could not understand

40:37.463 --> 40:41.922
how I could ever in my life want
what he wanted.

40:45.547 --> 40:46.505
Now,

40:47.755 --> 40:50.505
66 years later, I understand it.

40:52.922 --> 40:55.505
Some moments change us forever.

41:01.713 --> 41:03.797
Some pain you never forget.

41:09.297 --> 41:11.172
But there is a way

41:13.047 --> 41:17.630
that leads us out
of all of this cruel futility.

41:19.797 --> 41:22.922
But if that's true, if there is a way,

41:23.963 --> 41:27.297
why does it all happen as it always has,
why have you changed nothing?

41:46.380 --> 41:49.672
Every development
builds on the previous one.

41:50.588 --> 41:53.172
First you have the wheel, then the car.

41:53.630 --> 41:56.797
I can't be me
without previously having been you.

41:58.505 --> 42:01.338
You saw the passage, in the bunker.

42:02.130 --> 42:04.380
The chair, the device.

42:05.380 --> 42:06.963
The thing in the future.

42:08.255 --> 42:10.422
But that is not the end of the chain.

42:17.047 --> 42:18.630
Thanks for taking the time.

42:23.922 --> 42:24.755
I'd like...

42:27.713 --> 42:29.338
you to analyze this for me.

42:30.422 --> 42:31.380
And not a word,

42:32.588 --> 42:33.755
to anyone.

42:40.630 --> 42:41.755
What is it?

42:43.422 --> 42:45.297
If it's what I think it is,

42:46.672 --> 42:49.755
it'll revolutionize
our understanding of the world.

43:25.130 --> 43:27.422
MODERN TALKING
ALBUM TOUR, 1987

43:27.505 --> 43:29.922
PRESERVE CREATION
GAIN THE FUTURE

43:48.463 --> 43:50.588
Stop! Wait, stop! Pull over!

43:51.005 --> 43:52.672
Those are my children!

43:52.755 --> 43:55.130
Magnus! Martha!

43:59.422 --> 44:00.755
Do you believe me now?

44:29.130 --> 44:30.463
You're back!

44:31.422 --> 44:32.963
Where have you been?

44:47.255 --> 44:49.338
Did this ever mean anything to you?

44:53.547 --> 44:55.630
Did you ever actually love Dad?

45:00.713 --> 45:02.630
I know you had an affair with Ulrich.

45:05.338 --> 45:08.213
If you could choose
between Dad and Ulrich now...

45:17.630 --> 45:20.880
With all this shit, I thought you were
the only person I can trust.

45:44.505 --> 45:45.963
I ruined everything,

45:46.797 --> 45:47.713
I know.

45:49.088 --> 45:50.630
Maybe you always have.

45:57.505 --> 45:58.547
Jonas.

46:02.713 --> 46:04.213
You need no one.

46:05.797 --> 46:07.130
Just yourself.

49:04.797 --> 49:08.172
It's not the same
as what lies in the future.

49:08.755 --> 49:12.047
It is, in a manner of speaking, it's twin.

49:14.838 --> 49:17.172
It is a part of the infinite.

49:20.005 --> 49:21.672
It pervades everything.

49:22.463 --> 49:26.963
People have given it a myriad of names
over the centuries,

49:27.422 --> 49:31.088
ether, dark matter, the Higgs field.

49:31.422 --> 49:32.797
How did it come to be?

49:33.047 --> 49:38.963
The one in the future, via the disaster
in two days you so dearly want to prevent.

49:40.338 --> 49:43.713
This one here we produced ourselves.

49:44.963 --> 49:47.838
It is the end
of a technological evolution.

49:48.922 --> 49:49.755
And...

49:50.588 --> 49:53.088
it will be the end of the knot.

49:55.005 --> 49:58.547
This right here
will take you to the exact day

49:59.422 --> 50:01.213
that you want to travel to.

50:03.130 --> 50:06.463
It breaks the 33-year cycle.

50:09.088 --> 50:10.547
That's why I'm here.

50:11.547 --> 50:13.047
That's what you want from me.

50:13.505 --> 50:17.297
There is a way to stop it all
if I stop the beginning.

50:18.297 --> 50:19.630
That there is.

50:20.963 --> 50:23.713
The question is only,
when is the beginning?

50:25.255 --> 50:28.463
And what sacrifice must we make?

50:31.880 --> 50:34.047
June 20, 2019.

50:35.838 --> 50:37.880
The day before it all happened.

50:39.463 --> 50:41.922
Before Dad took his own life.

50:45.922 --> 50:47.838
Before it all fell apart.

50:49.838 --> 50:53.172
If you can prevent him
from taking his life,

50:55.338 --> 50:58.338
then everything that follows
will not occur.

51:00.088 --> 51:02.963
Mikkel will not travel back.

51:05.797 --> 51:06.713
You...

51:07.463 --> 51:08.297
I...

51:09.755 --> 51:11.255
We won't be born.

51:14.338 --> 51:16.213
But everyone else will live.

51:20.255 --> 51:22.630
Martha will live.

52:00.588 --> 52:02.130
If you succeed

52:03.172 --> 52:05.338
we will reorder the world.

52:39.672 --> 52:44.088
