00:02.503 --> 00:03.904
Tonight on Kitchen Nightmares,

00:03.937 --> 00:07.240
Chef Ramsay heads
to Manhattan Beach, California,

00:07.274 --> 00:09.876
where he must contend with
the youngest restaurant owner

00:09.910 --> 00:10.911
he's ever encountered.

00:10.944 --> 00:11.912
How old are you,
if you don't mind...

00:11.945 --> 00:13.413
28.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.715
She may be an ambitious
business school graduate...

00:15.749 --> 00:18.485
I didn't really expect it
to be this hard.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.088
But she may have picked
the wrong business to get into.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.824
Lisa, I am not selling food
like this.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.225
She's clueless in the kitchen.

00:25.258 --> 00:26.460
When was the last time
you looked in this fridge?

00:26.493 --> 00:27.527
Never, really.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.862
Salmon dip.

00:28.895 --> 00:30.000
She doesn't eat the food.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.497
She doesn't eat the food.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.932
I'm actually a vegetarian.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.700
And she has no control

00:33.733 --> 00:35.001
Of her restaurant.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.803
What are you doing?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.371
Why are you standing here?

00:38.405 --> 00:40.740
Tonight, Chef Ramsay tries
to educate

00:40.774 --> 00:42.042
This young owner.

00:42.075 --> 00:43.143
You're searing tuna

00:43.176 --> 00:44.711
on a Monday
for Thursday night.

00:44.744 --> 00:46.546
But when class begins...
Whoa.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.483
Will this owner's immaturity
be her downfall?

00:49.516 --> 00:51.551
I think
you're a jerk.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.220
And will the kitchen staff
stick around

00:53.253 --> 00:54.287
for graduation day?

00:54.321 --> 00:55.722
Hello!
We giving up, sir.

00:55.755 --> 00:57.324
Yeah, I know you've given up.

00:57.357 --> 00:59.159
Literally!

00:59.192 --> 01:00.000
Get ready for a crash course...

01:00.000 --> 01:00.961
Get ready for a crash course...

01:02.329 --> 01:03.497
In restaurant 101.

01:03.530 --> 01:04.931
You may have bought
the restaurant at 23,

01:04.965 --> 01:05.966
but you're not running it.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.200
Grow up, Lisa,
will you?

01:29.156 --> 01:30.000
Just south of Los Angeles

01:30.000 --> 01:30.457
Just south of Los Angeles

01:30.490 --> 01:31.958
is the picturesque beach town

01:31.992 --> 01:33.693
of Manhattan Beach.

01:33.727 --> 01:38.498
Five years ago, Lisa Hemmat,
an ambitious 23-year-old,

01:38.532 --> 01:39.966
fresh out
of USC Business School,

01:40.000 --> 01:42.936
bought a restaurant
called Lido di Manhattan.

01:42.969 --> 01:43.937
Hey, guys, how are you?

01:43.970 --> 01:46.072
Welcome to Lido.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.074
I think I do surprise
a lot of people

01:48.108 --> 01:49.176
based on first impression.

01:49.209 --> 01:51.444
And seeing someone
as young

01:51.478 --> 01:53.547
as I am and female,

01:53.580 --> 01:56.483
I think they are surprised...
Thanks for joining us.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.319
Most people still think

01:59.352 --> 02:00.000
That my parents gave it
to me

02:00.000 --> 02:01.154
That my parents gave it
to me

02:01.188 --> 02:02.889
or I married somebody
that gave it to me.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.958
Which is frustrating,
but at the same time,

02:04.991 --> 02:06.893
I know the truth.

02:06.927 --> 02:10.897
I went to USC and studied
business entrepreneurship.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.999
So after I graduated college,

02:13.033 --> 02:14.134
I was bound and determined

02:14.167 --> 02:16.036
to only work for myself,

02:16.069 --> 02:17.504
but instead of starting
from scratch,

02:17.537 --> 02:19.940
I started looking
at existing businesses

02:19.973 --> 02:22.108
with staff,
with customer base.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.746
And Lido just seemed
like a real great fit.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.081
I don't think it looks good
like that.

02:28.114 --> 02:30.000
What? One long--
One big table.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.184
What? One long--
One big table.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.619
Lisa did not, at that time,
have the experience

02:32.652 --> 02:35.055
to run a full restaurant,
in my opinion.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.591
I think
we should separate them.

02:37.624 --> 02:38.792
The only thing,
at that point in time,

02:38.825 --> 02:40.293
that I believe
really helped this restaurant

02:40.327 --> 02:42.796
be successful
is that she did have a staff

02:42.829 --> 02:44.164
that had been here forever.

02:45.899 --> 02:47.801
Lisa is a very smart person,

02:47.834 --> 02:49.469
But she doesn't have
a lot of experience

02:49.502 --> 02:50.570
with a restaurant.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.172
I don't want
to hear complaints.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.440
I don't want
to hear.

02:53.473 --> 02:54.708
I just want
to hang out.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.042
If you see a wine key,

02:56.076 --> 02:58.278
I took it
from Priscila.

02:58.311 --> 03:00.000
A lot of times,
she gets things mixed up.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.448
A lot of times,
she gets things mixed up.

03:01.481 --> 03:04.184
Like, she considers me
as a friend,

03:04.217 --> 03:05.885
not as an employee.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.587
Do you have
his phone number?

03:07.621 --> 03:10.690
Why are there Morocco?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.826
They've been there.
You put them there on your...

03:12.859 --> 03:14.227
I didn't--
I can't reach that.

03:15.295 --> 03:17.497
Damien is bar manager

03:17.530 --> 03:21.268
And someone
that I have been

03:21.301 --> 03:24.104
kind of dating
in the last six months.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.405
Thank you.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.140
I don't think
that I have a title.

03:27.173 --> 03:28.675
If she sees something
that needs to be done

03:28.708 --> 03:29.876
and will ask me to do it,
I'll do it.

03:29.909 --> 03:30.000
Are you okay?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.344
Are you okay?

03:31.378 --> 03:32.379
No.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.848
Give me these.
Just relax.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.349
I kind of crossed
this fuzzy line

03:36.383 --> 03:38.218
where I'm having him
work here.

03:38.251 --> 03:40.453
It's probably
a bad idea,

03:40.487 --> 03:43.023
but I'm gonna do it anyways.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.629
It's heartbreaking
to me

03:49.663 --> 03:52.098
to see other people
choosing

03:52.132 --> 03:54.668
other restaurants
around here.

03:54.701 --> 03:59.506
I struggle with why
it's not busier than it is.

03:59.539 --> 04:00.000
If Lido
doesn't change things here,

04:00.000 --> 04:02.809
If Lido
doesn't change things here,

04:02.842 --> 04:04.177
I don't think we'll be open

04:04.210 --> 04:06.680
until the beginning
of the next year.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.049
I've just been
so frustrated.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.984
I'm barely making it by.

04:11.017 --> 04:15.755
And, um, I can't continue on
like this.

04:21.728 --> 04:22.996
Parking lot is jammed,

04:23.029 --> 04:24.397
so my big question is,

04:24.431 --> 04:25.765
what's the problem
with the restaurant?

04:25.799 --> 04:26.800
I'm about to find out.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.168
Hello.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.169
Hi.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.000
How are you?

04:30.000 --> 04:30.337
How are you?

04:30.370 --> 04:31.671
Very well, thank you.
How are you?

04:31.705 --> 04:33.173
Good, I'm Lisa Hemmat.
Lisa, nice to see you.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.341
You're the...
Owner.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.342
You're the owner.
Yeah.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.943
Um, just so
very quickly,

04:36.976 --> 04:38.211
you've been
in business for how long?

04:38.244 --> 04:39.913
I've been here
for five years.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.348
You don't look
that old.

04:41.381 --> 04:42.349
How old are you,
if you don't mind my asking?

04:42.382 --> 04:43.516
28.
28.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.085
So you got it
when you were 23?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.152
23. Yeah.

04:46.186 --> 04:47.153
How did you manage
to get a restaurant at 23?

04:47.187 --> 04:48.621
I was just determined

04:48.655 --> 04:50.323
when I graduated college.

04:50.357 --> 04:51.591
And you graduated
from where?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.993
USC, Marshall School
of Business.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.261
Okay, yeah. What was that,
a graduation present?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.464
No, Dad didn't buy me
a restaurant.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.265
Dad cosigned
on a loan for me.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.000
And so I'm gonna have
a quick bite to eat.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
And so I'm gonna have
a quick bite to eat.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.068
Okay.
Thank you.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.437
Go ahead and--
You want me to sit there?

05:04.471 --> 05:05.939
All these colors.
Who came up with these colors?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.407
The previous owners

05:07.440 --> 05:09.709
Came up
with the colors.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.578
I kind of have kept it
the way it was.

05:11.611 --> 05:12.912
Right. What's changed

05:12.946 --> 05:14.481
since you took over
from the older restaurant?

05:14.514 --> 05:15.915
I haven't changed too much.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.450
Oh, really?
What, in five years?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.119
Yeah, in five years.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.387
So this is the same menu

05:20.420 --> 05:22.155
that was off
the previous owner's a la carte?

05:22.188 --> 05:23.656
Mm-hmm.
Right.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.758
And the head chef's name is?

05:24.791 --> 05:27.160
Louis Martinez.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.595
And Louis has been here
for 18 years.

05:28.628 --> 05:29.763
And the sous-chef is?

05:29.796 --> 05:30.000
His brother Arturo.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.631
His brother Arturo.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.966
Okay, good.
What would you recommend?

05:32.999 --> 05:35.068
This filet
wrapped in pancetta

05:35.101 --> 05:38.738
topped with a homemade balsamic
reduction sauce,

05:38.772 --> 05:41.274
but I'm actually vegetarian.

05:41.307 --> 05:42.509
Just say that again.

05:42.542 --> 05:43.510
Sorry, you're...

05:43.543 --> 05:45.512
Yes, I'm vegetarian.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.347
You're vegetarian?
Yeah.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.115
Right, so char-grilled filet,
but hold the filet.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.683
Yeah, that dish is awesome.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.085
Thank you.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.354
Wow.
Bizarre.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.422
Hello.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.623
Hello. How are you?
Priscilla.

05:56.656 --> 05:57.857
Priscilla, nice.
Beautiful name.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.692
And I will be your server.
Okay, great.

05:59.726 --> 06:00.000
Makes sense.
Thank you.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.327
Makes sense.
Thank you.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.862
Priscilla, I think I'm ready.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.301
The baked eggplant roll

06:08.334 --> 06:09.402
and then the spicy ahi tower,
please.

06:09.436 --> 06:10.703
All right.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.772
And then
the tortellini pasta salad.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.140
Okay.
Yeah, thank you.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.508
You're welcome.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.010
Young man,
how are you?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.044
Damien.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.746
I'm the bar manager

06:19.779 --> 06:21.247
and the catering director.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.348
That's a big title.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.683
Catering director
and bar manager.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.018
All at once.
Well done.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.486
Is Lisa a good boss?

06:26.519 --> 06:28.655
Lisa is a lovely boss,
yes.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.000
Lovely boss.

06:30.000 --> 06:30.657
Lovely boss.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.592
Sometimes when they refer
to the boss as being lovely,

06:32.625 --> 06:34.294
it sounds
like it's an intimate lovely.

06:36.796 --> 06:37.797
Which, there's nothing
wrong with it.

06:37.831 --> 06:38.865
No.
Is there?

06:38.898 --> 06:40.900
No, I am dating Lisa,
yes.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.269
Okay.
Right.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.671
That's why she's lovely.
Got you now.

06:44.704 --> 06:47.006
Okay.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.312
Oh.

06:52.345 --> 06:53.313
And what is that?

06:53.346 --> 06:54.547
Eggplant roll.
Really?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.416
Really hot. Yeah.
Don't worry. Thank you.

06:56.449 --> 06:57.684
Um, and these are stuffed with?

06:57.717 --> 06:58.852
Mozzarella cheese.

06:58.885 --> 06:59.886
Mozzarella.
Thank you.

06:59.919 --> 07:00.000
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.855
Mm-hmm.
Oh, dear.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.824
That doesn't look
very appetizing, does it?

07:04.858 --> 07:08.795
Oof.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.568
Crunchy eggplant.
Undercooked.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.904
The eggplant's raw.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.339
That's why it's gone
so black.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.640
Take that back 'cause it's,
like, piled in grease.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.709
No problem.
Eggplant shouldn't be crunchy.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.077
Ooh, dear.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.845
Ay-yi-yi.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.614
He sent it back
because of the--

07:27.647 --> 07:29.582
eggplant is not cooked
properly.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.453
This is the ahi tower
appetizer.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.522
Thank you.
Ah, dear.

07:35.555 --> 07:36.956
I feel like
there's a firework display

07:36.990 --> 07:38.258
taking place on my plate.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.059
Rocket man.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.231
It's so compressed,

07:45.265 --> 07:49.302
it feels like it's been done
two days ago.

07:49.335 --> 07:52.739
Ouch.
Spicy ahi tuna.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.509
That tuna doesn't taste fresh.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.378
It's grainy,
and it's furry.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.000
Here, you've been sat there
watching me.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.048
Here, you've been sat there
watching me.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.217
Come on.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.852
Hey, come on.

08:05.885 --> 08:07.153
No, no, come on.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.225
That's just gross.

08:12.258 --> 08:14.227
Oh, did you like?

08:14.260 --> 08:17.030
No, I didn't.
Is that frozen tuna?

08:17.063 --> 08:18.264
Is it?
Yeah.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.265
I'll bypass and go
to the next one.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.433
No problem.
Thank you.

08:20.466 --> 08:21.768
Funny how an owner's

08:21.801 --> 08:23.536
not even in the kitchen.

08:23.570 --> 08:24.771
There's been one mistake,
two mistakes.

08:24.804 --> 08:26.072
She's just standing there,

08:26.105 --> 08:27.640
hanging out
and chilling out.

08:29.475 --> 08:30.000
He said that it tastes
like frozen tuna.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.378
He said that it tastes
like frozen tuna.

08:32.412 --> 08:33.613
It is frozen tuna.

08:33.646 --> 08:36.382
I told him
it was fresh.

08:36.416 --> 08:37.483
Here's the bad news,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.119
so far not a slim
ray of sunshine,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.688
not even a glimmer
of hope

08:41.721 --> 08:44.591
anywhere in the food.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.092
Chicken tortellini
pasta salad.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.994
Excellent, good.
Now is that home-cooked?

08:48.027 --> 08:48.995
Those are not homemade.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.597
Ah, thanks.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.334
Eh?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.635
What is that in there?

08:55.668 --> 08:57.770
It tastes like rubber.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.772
That is hideous.

08:59.806 --> 09:00.000
Ugh.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.207
Ugh.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.709
Yeah, not very pleasant.
No?

09:02.742 --> 09:04.510
No, I mean that's
just stone-cold.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.578
I'm sorry.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.679
Ask Lisa to taste
the tortellini,

09:06.713 --> 09:07.780
just the vegetarian part.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.649
All right.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.154
I still think
it tastes good.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.656
Everything,
vegetarian at least,

09:16.689 --> 09:18.591
I've tried, I love.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.628
So I think our food
tastes great to me.

09:21.661 --> 09:22.895
It really does.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.564
Vegetarian owner Lisa

09:24.597 --> 09:26.265
Has relied
on the Martinez brothers...

09:26.299 --> 09:27.433
Hi, guys.
Hello.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.468
Come around.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.636
And a menu she inherited

09:29.669 --> 09:30.000
From the previous owner,

09:30.000 --> 09:31.070
From the previous owner,

09:31.104 --> 09:33.773
and Chef Ramsay
was not impressed.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.074
So what hurts

09:35.108 --> 09:36.476
more than anything

09:36.509 --> 09:39.379
was how bad the food was.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.247
I can't think

09:41.280 --> 09:42.649
of a worse
vegetable to serve raw

09:42.682 --> 09:44.150
than a slice

09:44.183 --> 09:47.654
of crunchy eggplant.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.155
Why is your restaurant

09:49.188 --> 09:50.723
that's on it's ass

09:50.757 --> 09:52.492
cooking frozen pasta

09:52.525 --> 09:53.526
with a  filling

09:53.559 --> 09:54.727
and frozen tuna?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.329
Two of the biggest insults.

09:58.197 --> 09:59.832
Are you powerless to talk?

10:06.072 --> 10:07.907
Lisa, come on.
Who runs this restaurant?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.442
Who's in charge?

10:09.475 --> 10:10.677
I'm in charge.

10:10.710 --> 10:11.844
So you're giving them

10:11.878 --> 10:13.279
the permission
to cook like this.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.081
Yeah, I guess.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.216
Me.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.317
I've had a  lunch here.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.352
I'm embarrassed.

10:19.385 --> 10:20.753
And you tell me
you run the place.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.888
Yeah.

10:21.921 --> 10:24.323
But you don't have
the initiative

10:24.357 --> 10:26.426
to identify
that that's.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.994
Why?

10:28.027 --> 10:29.162
I didn't know.

10:29.195 --> 10:30.000
You didn't know?
No.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.530
You didn't know?
No.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.598
You don't need a degree

10:32.632 --> 10:34.200
to  identify
that crap.

10:34.233 --> 10:35.501
Trust me.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.637
I think he's being
a little over-dramatic.

10:37.670 --> 10:40.807
We do overall have customers
that do enjoy the food.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.375
And you tell me
you run the place.

10:42.408 --> 10:46.446
I guess I didn't think of it
as that horrible or bad.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.749
You're dreaming, sweetheart.

10:49.782 --> 10:50.950
Coming up...

10:50.983 --> 10:52.385
That is disgusting.

10:52.418 --> 10:54.220
Chef Ramsay makes
a frightening find.

10:54.253 --> 10:55.221
Filth.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.023
We have customers
to serve right now.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.058
And has to make
a dramatic decision.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.000
You serve those customers
right now,

11:00.000 --> 11:00.460
You serve those customers
right now,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.628
I'm out of here.
your choice.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.163
But this time...
Excuse me.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.565
He involves the customers.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.400
Are you interested
in being served dinner

11:07.433 --> 11:09.068
with that filth?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.503
Then...
Stop.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.472
A vicious fight
in the kitchen erupts.

11:12.505 --> 11:13.506
What do you want?

11:13.539 --> 11:15.141
What do you mean,
what do I want?

11:15.174 --> 11:16.809
As Chef Ramsay
attempts to teach...

11:16.843 --> 11:18.244
Let's clean it.

11:18.277 --> 11:19.612
But this young owner
refuses to learn.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.748
Was it really affecting
our food tonight? No.

11:21.781 --> 11:23.683
Grow up, Lisa, will you?

11:23.716 --> 11:25.852
That's coming up
on Kitchen Nightmares.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.193
After an uninspiring lunch,

11:34.227 --> 11:36.429
Chef Ramsay is looking
for some good news

11:36.462 --> 11:38.564
in tonight's dinner service.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.199
Enjoy your dinner.
Welcome.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.935
My name's Damien, I'll be
taking care of you tonight.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.570
I'm gonna go with
the seared ahi tuna.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.572
Muscat, okay.
Sure, absolutely.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.717
Um...

11:57.750 --> 11:59.589
The computers have been
an issue for me from day one.

11:59.589 --> 12:00.053
The computers have been
an issue for me from day one.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.220
It's really outdated.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.891
The keyboard's not even
working properly,

12:04.924 --> 12:06.626
so you keep pressing,
pressing, pressing.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.695
Doesn't work.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.663
It's ridiculous.

12:12.999 --> 12:14.467
My God.
How old is this thing?

12:14.500 --> 12:16.836
It's, I think,
about 30 years old.

12:16.869 --> 12:18.004
Everything's coded,

12:18.037 --> 12:19.339
like numbers.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.840
For each and every order?
That's correct.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.675
And sometimes all the buttons
don't work.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.045
Do you have a ticket
for 108?

12:27.313 --> 12:28.648
They don't have a ticket
for 108.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.589
Louis, double-check
if you have my tickets,

12:29.589 --> 12:30.616
Louis, double-check
if you have my tickets,

12:30.650 --> 12:32.318
104 and 105.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.120
Uh, nah.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.221
This is absolute madness.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.023
This whole
computerized system

12:37.056 --> 12:38.224
is a  nightmare.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.960
I hate the computer.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.830
Whenever we kinda busy,
like really put us behind.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.665
The computer just sucks.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.534
While an antiquated
ordering system

12:48.568 --> 12:51.337
Creates havoc for the front
of the house and the kitchen,

12:51.371 --> 12:52.772
chef Louis pushes on

12:52.805 --> 12:55.641
and manages to get entrees out
to the dining room.

12:55.675 --> 12:57.710
Well, that's just--

13:01.981 --> 13:03.983
Okay.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.553
Oh, no.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.790
Gummy?

13:10.823 --> 13:12.191
Yeah.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.093
Yeah, she's right.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.628
Gummy.
She's being polite.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.431
I think
that Lisa doesn't know

13:18.464 --> 13:20.466
what's going on
with the kitchen.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.535
What's this here?

13:22.568 --> 13:25.938
Louie, when was
all this done?

13:25.972 --> 13:29.409
So we're searing tuna
on a Monday for Thursday?

13:29.442 --> 13:29.589
Yeah.

13:29.589 --> 13:31.911
Yeah.

13:31.944 --> 13:35.615
What are you doing?
Look at the color of it.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.617
Get me Lisa, please.

13:37.650 --> 13:38.818
Right here.

13:38.851 --> 13:43.389
I'm getting
really nervous now.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.857
Thursday.

13:44.891 --> 13:47.326
We can't sear tuna
to order?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.895
That's why
it doesn't taste good.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.663
Does that make business sense
upstairs or--

13:50.696 --> 13:52.698
No, it doesn't.

13:52.732 --> 13:54.400
When was the last time
you looked in this fridge?

13:54.434 --> 13:58.337
Uh, I never really
examined it.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.589
No.

13:59.589 --> 13:59.672
No.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.074
Oh, dear.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.875
Lisa, how long ago

14:02.909 --> 14:04.710
do you think
that was sliced?

14:04.744 --> 14:05.845
I don't know.
Roughly?

14:05.878 --> 14:07.013
A couple days?

14:07.046 --> 14:09.682
A couple of days?
It's like pastrami.

14:09.715 --> 14:11.784
But that is scary.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.387
Ay-yi-yi.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.988
Like, I don't know
these things are going on

14:16.022 --> 14:18.291
unless someone tells me,
and they haven't told me.

14:18.324 --> 14:21.861
Dinner service
is off to a rough start.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.563
Customers are unhappy.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.167
The food is far from fresh.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.589
And Lisa, the owner,
is unaware

14:29.589 --> 14:29.802
And Lisa, the owner,
is unaware

14:29.836 --> 14:32.105
of many of the problems
in her own kitchen.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.439
I don't know what to do.

14:33.473 --> 14:35.441
But as bad as it is,

14:35.475 --> 14:36.776
It's about to get worse.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.845
Oh, my God.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.880
That's disgusting.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.454
Oh,.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.857
Stop.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.792
You, stop.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.695
Everybody, stop.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.498
Lisa, come here two seconds.
Come here.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.589
When was the last time
this place was cleaned?

14:59.589 --> 15:01.200
When was the last time
this place was cleaned?

15:01.234 --> 15:02.702
They should be cleaning
every day.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.071
But look.
Just here.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.440
Just everywhere.
Disgusting.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.441
Look at it.

15:08.474 --> 15:10.943
This is above food.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.545
I mean, come on.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.780
Louis, I am not
serving food like this.

15:14.814 --> 15:15.948
Okay.

15:15.982 --> 15:18.818
That is disgusting.

15:18.851 --> 15:22.388
I don't think it really has
affected or gone in the food.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.557
How do you know?

15:24.590 --> 15:26.225
We have customers
to serve right now.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.827
Okay, do me a favor.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.589
You serve those customers
right now, I'm out of here.

15:29.589 --> 15:30.329
You serve those customers
right now, I'm out of here.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.831
Your  choice.

15:31.864 --> 15:32.932
'Cause you think
I'm gonna stand there--

15:32.965 --> 15:34.167
What do you--
what do you want--

15:34.200 --> 15:35.568
What do you mean,
what do I want?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.006
, I'll do it
this way then.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.675
Excuse me!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.644
Excuse me!

15:44.677 --> 15:45.878
All these tables here,

15:45.912 --> 15:47.213
can I borrow you
for two seconds, please?

15:47.246 --> 15:49.048
Follow me.

15:51.817 --> 15:54.320
Sir, come through.
Madam, come through.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.789
I just stopped
serving food in here

15:56.822 --> 15:59.589
because of the
and the dust.

15:59.589 --> 15:59.792
because of the
and the dust.

15:59.825 --> 16:01.594
Are you interested
in being served dinner

16:01.627 --> 16:03.429
with that filth
dripping in your food?

16:03.462 --> 16:07.066
Does anyone
want to eat now?

16:07.099 --> 16:08.134
Nn-nn-nn.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.669
That's your customers.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.138
You need me
to tell you that?

16:12.171 --> 16:13.339
Laugh.

16:13.372 --> 16:14.774
I'm not laughing.

16:14.807 --> 16:15.908
I think you're a jerk.

16:15.942 --> 16:16.909
You should be embarrassed.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.911
Excuse me.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.715
It's a little bit
gross like that,

16:22.748 --> 16:25.051
but was it really affecting
our food tonight? No.

16:25.084 --> 16:27.520
Like, did he need to make
a huge spectacle

16:27.553 --> 16:29.589
and embarrass me in front
of all my customers? No.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.823
and embarrass me in front
of all my customers? No.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.024
Lisa.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.429
Lisa, what do you mean?

16:36.462 --> 16:38.064
You come out,
make us look like

16:38.097 --> 16:41.767
in front of, like,
friends and customers.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.536
Lisa, the first thing
I said,

16:43.569 --> 16:45.037
"Could we stop
serving food?"

16:45.071 --> 16:46.372
You're totally oblivious

16:46.405 --> 16:47.773
to what's happening
in your business.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.408
You may have bought
the restaurant at 23,

16:49.442 --> 16:51.310
my darling, but you're not
running it.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.813
Grow up, Lisa,
will you?

17:05.590 --> 17:07.692
It's an hour
into dinner service.

17:07.726 --> 17:10.228
Chef Ramsay has uncovered
an unsanitary situation

17:10.262 --> 17:11.329
in the kitchen...

17:11.363 --> 17:12.664
Grow up, Lisa,
will you?

17:12.697 --> 17:15.734
And Lisa has escaped
to the bathroom.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.235
As for the kitchen,

17:17.269 --> 17:18.703
they're about to get
some much-needed direction,

17:18.737 --> 17:21.773
not from the owner
but from Gordon.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.909
Don't stare.
Clean.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.111
Everybody, grab a towel
and start cleaning.

17:26.144 --> 17:28.980
The kitchen. It's disgusting.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.282
I mean, we're talking
about inches of dirt,

17:30.315 --> 17:31.316
and it's gross.

17:31.349 --> 17:32.317
I mean, look at this.

17:32.350 --> 17:32.722
He's right.

17:32.722 --> 17:33.752
He's right.

17:33.785 --> 17:35.187
Filthy.

17:35.220 --> 17:36.955
Dinner service
is full force right now.

17:36.988 --> 17:38.023
We've got 93 people
in the restaurant

17:38.056 --> 17:39.224
that need their food,

17:39.257 --> 17:40.692
and dinner service
is stopped.

17:40.725 --> 17:42.127
I don't know
what else to do.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.562
Where is Lisa?
Has she gone upstairs?

17:43.595 --> 17:44.996
She's in the restroom,
yeah.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.932
She's in the restroom.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.402
If she's in the restroom, then
the restroom's in the.

17:50.435 --> 17:52.737
Sulking precious princess.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.852
I have never seen
Lisa like that

18:06.885 --> 18:08.453
or upset like that ever.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.988
She's a very tough person.

18:15.961 --> 18:18.396
I didn't expect she was going
to react like that.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.365
Damien, okay.

18:20.398 --> 18:21.533
That's fine, yeah.

18:21.566 --> 18:22.701
That's clean, yeah?
Yeah.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.370
It's as clean as
I've ever seen it.

18:25.403 --> 18:28.106
Louie, okay, we can start
firing up again, now, yes?

18:28.139 --> 18:30.141
Is Lisa out
of the toilet yet?

18:32.677 --> 18:32.722
She's still in there?

18:32.722 --> 18:33.745
She's still in there?

18:33.778 --> 18:34.980
That's nearly an hour.

18:37.449 --> 18:38.984
I've been here
for an hour and 20 minutes,

18:39.017 --> 18:40.519
and I'm not gonna
wait much longer.

18:40.552 --> 18:41.953
We've been waiting
too long.

18:41.987 --> 18:43.989
Is she okay?
Is she going to the bathroom?

18:44.022 --> 18:45.390
Do you want
to go and check on her or--

18:45.423 --> 18:46.725
I can check on her.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.060
Would you mind?
Thank you.
No, no problem.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.722
She's not gonna come out
for nothing.

19:02.722 --> 19:02.774
She's not gonna come out
for nothing.

19:02.807 --> 19:03.875
We're trying really hard.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.410
So she's given up.

19:05.443 --> 19:07.112
No.

19:07.145 --> 19:08.580
Come on, Bruna.

19:08.613 --> 19:09.915
A dismal dinner service

19:09.948 --> 19:10.949
comes to an end...

19:10.982 --> 19:13.285
Not even an appetizer?

19:13.318 --> 19:16.421
With disappointed customers
leaving unsatisfied.

19:16.454 --> 19:19.658
As for Lisa,
she finishes off the service

19:19.691 --> 19:22.661
still sequestered
in the bathroom.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.436
I didn't really expect it
to be this hard.

19:31.469 --> 19:32.722
I try my best,

19:32.722 --> 19:33.738
I try my best,

19:33.772 --> 19:35.740
and I really want the best
for this restaurant.

19:35.774 --> 19:37.609
You have two minutes?
Yes.

19:37.642 --> 19:39.344
I don't know.

19:39.377 --> 19:41.780
I feel pretty helpless
right now.

19:43.648 --> 19:45.050
So that was a  night.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.518
Mm-hmm.

19:46.551 --> 19:48.620
You got upset,
and you disappeared.

19:48.653 --> 19:50.155
Yeah.

19:50.188 --> 19:52.257
That's not the way
to face problems.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.792
What was I supposed
to do?

19:53.825 --> 19:56.528
Like, do you want me
to go back and dust?

19:56.561 --> 19:58.129
Like, I don't get what you're
trying to say right now.

19:58.163 --> 19:59.497
You don't get--
Okay, okay.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.467
So is that the kind of trick
that they teach you

20:02.500 --> 20:02.722
in an honors degree,

20:02.722 --> 20:03.868
in an honors degree,

20:03.902 --> 20:07.339
to disappear in a toilet
like a precious princess?

20:07.372 --> 20:10.875
I don't think of myself
as, like, a princess.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.611
I really don't.

20:12.644 --> 20:15.413
Like, I just think
I am an average person

20:15.447 --> 20:18.049
working hard
to fulfill my dreams.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.451
You bought
the restaurant young.
Yeah.

20:19.484 --> 20:20.852
That was the easy part,
purchasing.

20:20.885 --> 20:23.054
The hardest part
was the following day,

20:23.088 --> 20:24.489
running the  thing.

20:24.522 --> 20:27.058
Lisa, you know, no one's
ever told you the truth,

20:27.092 --> 20:30.595
but more importantly
I think you're in denial.

20:32.664 --> 20:32.722
Why am I here?

20:32.722 --> 20:33.965
Why am I here?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.700
Because we need help,

20:35.734 --> 20:37.802
and I'm missing
a key ingredient obviously,

20:37.836 --> 20:39.337
because we have
a good location.

20:39.371 --> 20:41.706
I have a great staff.
I have a good energy.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.809
I-I love the place.

20:44.843 --> 20:47.145
Something's missing.

20:47.178 --> 20:49.214
Okay, I'm gonna give you
a business assignment tonight.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.548
Back to the good old days,
USC.

20:50.582 --> 20:52.250
I need five

20:52.283 --> 20:54.352
real, clear changes

20:54.386 --> 20:55.920
that you want to make
tomorrow

20:55.954 --> 20:57.322
to be implemented.

20:57.355 --> 20:58.723
Okay.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.992
Tomorrow, new start.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.722
Those five issues may start
to really help convince me

21:02.722 --> 21:04.462
Those five issues may start
to really help convince me

21:04.496 --> 21:05.764
why you did this
five years ago.

21:05.797 --> 21:07.399
Okay.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.633
Good night.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.001
Good night.
Thank you.

21:19.110 --> 21:22.781
Last night Lisa failed her test
as a restaurant owner.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.315
But today
Chef Ramsay is hoping

21:24.349 --> 21:29.054
she will do a better job
with her homework assignment.

21:29.087 --> 21:30.555
All right,
where's Lisa?

21:30.588 --> 21:32.557
Right here.
Good morning.

21:32.590 --> 21:32.722
Trust you to be in the bathroom
when I came in this morning.

21:32.722 --> 21:34.492
Trust you to be in the bathroom
when I came in this morning.

21:37.262 --> 21:39.364
So last night
we had a little chat,

21:39.397 --> 21:41.499
and I asked Lisa
to come up

21:41.533 --> 21:44.069
with five instrumental changes

21:44.102 --> 21:46.371
that she wants
to put into this place

21:46.404 --> 21:48.606
to make a significant
difference.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.208
I want to hear
what those are.

21:50.241 --> 21:51.276
I'll give you one.

21:51.309 --> 21:54.879
Thank you.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.614
Okay, five things
that I would like to change

21:56.648 --> 21:58.349
about Lido today.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.418
Be proud of the food
we're serving.

22:00.452 --> 22:02.220
Keep a clean and sanitary

22:02.253 --> 22:02.722
environment everywhere.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.155
environment everywhere.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.124
The customers
should be impressed

22:06.157 --> 22:09.194
by the ambiance and decor,
not disgusted.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.630
We need to tighten up the menu
and stay with one theme

22:12.664 --> 22:13.665
that works.

22:13.698 --> 22:15.400
Okay, fifth?

22:15.433 --> 22:16.668
It's more for me.

22:16.701 --> 22:18.203
"To learn how
the kitchen operates."

22:18.269 --> 22:20.605
Yeah, good job, "A" plus.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.640
You've clearly shown me

22:22.673 --> 22:24.342
that you know the problems.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.911
The hardest thing now
is following it through.

22:26.944 --> 22:28.212
Yes.

22:28.246 --> 22:30.081
Last night was rock bottom,

22:30.114 --> 22:32.016
but I think, you know,
I'm gonna have to embrace

22:32.049 --> 22:32.722
these changes
and make sure they happen.

22:32.722 --> 22:35.353
these changes
and make sure they happen.

22:35.386 --> 22:38.556
There's one issue
that I'm concerned about

22:38.589 --> 22:42.560
that you haven't
managed to tackle.

22:42.593 --> 22:43.928
In fact,
let me show you here.

22:43.961 --> 22:47.732
It'll be easier
doing it this way.

22:51.869 --> 22:53.070
P.O.S.

22:53.104 --> 22:54.338
Piece of.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.808
That is the biggest headache

22:56.841 --> 22:58.376
inside this restaurant.

22:58.409 --> 23:00.845
They press less buttons

23:00.878 --> 23:02.722
at NASA launching astronauts
into space,

23:02.722 --> 23:04.081
at NASA launching astronauts
into space,

23:04.115 --> 23:07.151
I swear to God.

23:07.185 --> 23:08.152
Yes?

23:08.186 --> 23:09.754
Yes!
Oh, my God!

23:09.787 --> 23:11.355
Stand back.

23:11.389 --> 23:12.356
Ahh!

23:12.390 --> 23:14.892
Wait, wait, let us do it.

23:14.926 --> 23:16.561
Do it!

23:18.830 --> 23:20.765
But when he start
to just break the computer,

23:20.798 --> 23:22.366
I couldn't believe it.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.268
I was, ugh, in shock.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.938
One more!

23:26.971 --> 23:28.172
That was my dream come true.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.173
Let's go.

23:29.207 --> 23:31.609
Lisa,
let the frustrations go.

23:35.279 --> 23:36.314
Priscila's next.

23:36.347 --> 23:37.348
Yeah!

23:37.381 --> 23:38.649
I won't have to read anymore.

23:38.683 --> 23:41.953
Go, go, go, go.

23:41.986 --> 23:43.588
This is for all the hard time

23:43.621 --> 23:45.857
I had with this
piece of.

23:45.890 --> 23:46.858
I hate it.

23:46.891 --> 23:49.093
Bruna, let's go.

23:49.126 --> 23:50.428
I hate this!

23:50.461 --> 23:52.096
Come on, big boy,
let's go.

23:52.129 --> 23:53.831
Don't hurt yourself.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.566
I hate this thing.

23:58.002 --> 24:00.872
Oh, my God.

24:00.905 --> 24:02.139
I'm done with you.

24:02.173 --> 24:02.722
Ooh, that felt good.
Didn't it?

24:02.722 --> 24:04.242
Ooh, that felt good.
Didn't it?

24:04.275 --> 24:05.910
Well done.

24:05.943 --> 24:08.145
Coming up,

24:08.179 --> 24:10.214
There's mayhem
at Lido di Manhattan.

24:10.248 --> 24:11.515
Whoa!

24:11.549 --> 24:13.217
I'm begging you just
to talk to each other.

24:13.251 --> 24:14.619
I'm begging!

24:14.652 --> 24:15.987
In the kitchen,
there's a war or words.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.088
Stop it!

24:17.121 --> 24:18.089
And then,

24:18.122 --> 24:19.423
The cooks resign.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.158
They're leaving.
Who's leaving?

24:21.192 --> 24:22.360
We're giving up.
Bye.

24:22.393 --> 24:24.428
Oh, my God.
They walked out.

24:24.462 --> 24:26.030
Louie!

24:26.063 --> 24:28.065
Forcing Gordon to make
a desperate call for help.

24:28.099 --> 24:30.067
Listen, I need you
right now.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.836
The tide is rolling in.

24:31.869 --> 24:32.722
And this beach restaurant
may be too far underwater

24:32.722 --> 24:34.438
And this beach restaurant
may be too far underwater

24:34.472 --> 24:36.874
to save.

24:43.748 --> 24:44.816
While professor Ramsay

24:44.849 --> 24:47.385
is impressed
with Lisa's homework

24:47.418 --> 24:49.520
and her intentions
for the restaurant,

24:49.554 --> 24:51.356
class now continues
in the kitchen,

24:51.389 --> 24:52.857
where Gordon
is ready to educate Lisa

24:52.890 --> 24:54.325
and her chefs.

24:54.359 --> 24:56.094
So two changes tonight, yes?
Okay.

24:56.127 --> 24:58.196
Very simple,
we'll do a linguini of crab,

24:58.229 --> 25:01.332
and we'll do a seared tuna
salad nicoise, okay?

25:01.366 --> 25:02.367
Sounds good.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.068
Okay, so first thing.

25:04.102 --> 25:07.572
We're gonna sear the tuna.
Nice and gently done, yeah?

25:07.605 --> 25:10.074
Is it always cooked
at the same temperature?

25:10.108 --> 25:10.879
Yeah, in terms of the quality,
the least it needs cooking.

25:10.879 --> 25:11.709
Yeah, in terms of the quality,
the least it needs cooking.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.077
Okay.

25:13.111 --> 25:15.012
I don't know much
about food.

25:15.046 --> 25:16.614
So I thought it was
extremely exciting,

25:16.647 --> 25:18.383
and what an opportunity

25:18.416 --> 25:21.018
to watch someone
like Gordon Ramsay.

25:21.052 --> 25:22.787
To go with the
tuna nicoise,

25:22.820 --> 25:24.222
we've got a couple
of potatoes on there.

25:24.255 --> 25:26.524
It just looks so fresh
and flavorful.

25:26.557 --> 25:27.692
Vibrant.

25:27.725 --> 25:28.893
Okay, done.

25:28.926 --> 25:30.128
Gorgeous.
Beautiful.

25:30.161 --> 25:32.864
Right, Linguini, yeah?

25:32.897 --> 25:34.866
White wine in.

25:34.899 --> 25:37.001
Tossing this crab in.

25:37.034 --> 25:38.569
Fresh lime juice
right at the very end.

25:38.603 --> 25:40.405
Yeah, it's beautiful.

25:40.438 --> 25:40.879
Absolutely.

25:40.879 --> 25:41.706
Absolutely.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.878
After a rough first day,

25:46.911 --> 25:49.180
Lisa now has
a positive attitude.

25:49.213 --> 25:50.848
And Chef Ramsay is hoping...

25:50.882 --> 25:52.250
All right,
let's have a quick briefing.

25:52.283 --> 25:54.285
She's ready
for another assignment.

25:54.318 --> 25:56.187
Lisa, the boss,
you're gonna do something

25:56.220 --> 25:59.323
you haven't done
in five years.

25:59.357 --> 26:01.325
Tonight you--
yeah, here we are.

26:01.359 --> 26:02.760
Are on the line.

26:02.794 --> 26:04.395
That's right.

26:06.197 --> 26:07.665
Are you serious?

26:07.698 --> 26:09.300
I'm very serious.

26:09.333 --> 26:10.879
I'm a little nervous
about hurting myself.

26:10.879 --> 26:11.436
I'm a little nervous
about hurting myself.

26:11.469 --> 26:12.737
I hate knives.

26:12.770 --> 26:15.606
I cut myself when I was,
like, three years old.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.776
So I never would have expected
to put me on the line like that.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.011
I'll see you in a minute.

26:20.044 --> 26:22.814
We're opening
in five minutes.

26:22.847 --> 26:24.816
Hello.
Hi.

26:24.849 --> 26:26.217
Right this way.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.685
Your menu.
Thank you.

26:27.718 --> 26:29.287
Just so you ladies know,
in addition to our menu,

26:29.320 --> 26:30.621
we have two specials.

26:30.655 --> 26:31.956
Chef Ramsay has put Lisa

26:31.989 --> 26:33.691
in charge
of tonight's specials.

26:33.724 --> 26:35.960
That's for you, apron.
Perfect.

26:35.993 --> 26:37.295
He wants her to begin
to understand

26:37.328 --> 26:39.363
The inner workings
of her kitchen,

26:39.397 --> 26:40.879
something she has avoided
in the past.

26:40.879 --> 26:41.532
something she has avoided
in the past.

26:41.566 --> 26:44.202
Definitely came
as a shock to me.

26:44.235 --> 26:45.903
I'm thinking about
the seared ahi.

26:45.937 --> 26:47.872
I'm gonna have
the crab special.

26:47.905 --> 26:49.340
All right,
thank you very much, folks.

26:49.373 --> 26:50.475
Thank you.
You're welcome.

26:50.508 --> 26:51.976
Okay, there we go.
First order.

26:52.009 --> 26:53.811
Ahi tuna, yeah?

26:53.845 --> 26:56.581
I didn't understand
what we were doing.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.916
I was really confused.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.519
Why is this
not turning on?

27:01.552 --> 27:03.421
Lisa, get comfortable
with it, yeah?

27:03.454 --> 27:05.022
Get comfortable.

27:05.056 --> 27:06.157
Why is this
not turning on?

27:06.190 --> 27:07.225
This is hot.

27:07.258 --> 27:08.226
I don't know
what to do with it.

27:08.259 --> 27:09.594
Keep it here?

27:09.627 --> 27:10.795
Lisa was, like,
touching little things,

27:10.828 --> 27:10.879
like doing this,
"Oh, ouch.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.230
like doing this,
"Oh, ouch.

27:12.263 --> 27:13.331
Ow, it's hot."

27:13.364 --> 27:14.999
Ow, it's hot.

27:15.032 --> 27:17.235
Lisa,
you got to move fast.

27:17.268 --> 27:19.170
Whoa.

27:19.203 --> 27:21.506
Why is it flaming?

27:25.309 --> 27:27.278
That's going
in the microwave?
Yeah.

27:27.311 --> 27:29.480
Why isn't it
going in there?

27:29.514 --> 27:31.048
I think it's
a very valid point.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.550
Why is it going
in the microwave?

27:32.583 --> 27:34.252
Why can't it go--
the oven's on, yeah?

27:34.285 --> 27:35.786
Yeah, it's on.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.088
Okay, see what
I'm trying to say?

27:37.121 --> 27:38.322
It's really important
for you to see this.

27:38.356 --> 27:40.879
To see a dish

27:40.879 --> 27:40.892
To see a dish

27:40.925 --> 27:43.261
go directly
to the microwave,

27:43.294 --> 27:44.929
I was just--
I was really shocked.

27:44.962 --> 27:47.665
We're not here
spending all this money

27:47.698 --> 27:48.933
on microwaved food.

27:48.966 --> 27:50.401
Why would we do that?

27:50.434 --> 27:52.403
We're supposed to  use
the microwave,.

27:52.436 --> 27:54.605
How do we get flavor
out of a  microwave?

27:54.639 --> 27:55.606
It's so good for you
to see this,

27:55.640 --> 27:57.942
I cannot tell you.

27:57.975 --> 27:59.877
It's an hour
into dinner service,

27:59.911 --> 28:01.445
and while
Chef Ramsay's specials,

28:01.479 --> 28:03.681
prepared capably by Lisa,
are a hit...

28:03.714 --> 28:06.083
Did you like it?
That one's really good.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.352
The old menu cooked
by the kitchen staff

28:08.386 --> 28:09.387
Are a flop.

28:13.424 --> 28:14.492
Is it supposed
to be crunchy?

28:14.525 --> 28:16.527
This is not worth $24.

28:16.561 --> 28:17.828
Tonight was crazy.

28:17.862 --> 28:19.463
I probably had, like,

28:19.497 --> 28:23.067
seven items sent back,

28:23.100 --> 28:25.903
which is terrible.

28:25.937 --> 28:27.638
No problem.
I'll take this back.

28:27.672 --> 28:28.806
No problem.

28:28.839 --> 28:29.941
Medium rare, please.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.175
Medium rare, absolutely.

28:31.208 --> 28:32.410
I'll throw that right back
on the grill for you.

28:32.443 --> 28:33.678
Be right back out.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.012
In general, the plates
going back to the kitchen

28:35.046 --> 28:36.581
was frustrating for me.

28:36.614 --> 28:38.482
Medium rare, please.
That's rare.

28:38.516 --> 28:39.817
It seemed like
something went wrong

28:39.850 --> 28:40.879
with every one of my tables.

28:40.879 --> 28:42.887
with every one of my tables.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.055
It's overcooked?

28:44.088 --> 28:45.156
I am very frustrated.

28:45.189 --> 28:46.357
What's wrong with that?

28:46.390 --> 28:47.358
It's overcooked.

28:47.391 --> 28:49.160
What is that?

28:49.193 --> 28:51.796
This lamb is overcooked.
Please re-fire.

28:51.829 --> 28:54.198
Medium.

28:54.231 --> 28:56.200
Well, this is overcooked.
No, no, no.

28:56.233 --> 28:57.335
Re-fire, medium, thank you.

28:57.368 --> 28:58.703
You didn't write--
Hey, hey.

28:58.736 --> 28:59.870
You didn't write out
the temperature.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.973
Now I realize that
Arturo and Louis

29:02.006 --> 29:04.976
like to shift blame
all the time.

29:05.009 --> 29:07.478
Like, no one can take
responsibility.

29:07.511 --> 29:09.880
Okay, so medium, please.

29:09.914 --> 29:10.879
Okay, we got it, we got it.
Let's go.

29:10.879 --> 29:11.749
Okay, we got it, we got it.
Let's go.

29:11.782 --> 29:13.551
Can we just re-fire it first,

29:13.584 --> 29:15.319
and we'll argue it
after service, please?

29:15.353 --> 29:18.222
Everyone is yelling
and being angry.

29:18.255 --> 29:20.958
It just tears it apart.
Like, you can't do that.

29:20.992 --> 29:23.294
Re-fire lamb, medium.
Thank you.

29:23.327 --> 29:24.929
Thank you.

29:26.697 --> 29:28.699
Stop it!

29:34.806 --> 29:37.308
It's overcooked?
I'll take that back for you.

29:37.342 --> 29:38.743
Aside from the successful
dinner specials,

29:38.777 --> 29:41.446
Tonight's dinner service
has been a disaster.

29:41.479 --> 29:42.847
Re-fire lamb, medium.
Thank you.

29:42.881 --> 29:43.948
Yes, thank you.

29:43.982 --> 29:45.650
And Chef Ramsay

29:45.683 --> 29:47.986
is looking for someone
to talk control.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.888
Stop it!

29:49.921 --> 29:52.257
Okay.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.358
Thank you.

29:53.391 --> 29:54.459
How's that pork coming?

29:54.492 --> 29:56.528
Six minutes.
Six minutes.

29:56.561 --> 29:59.030
Two ahi towers
and one calamari.

29:59.063 --> 30:00.131
Right, Lisa, you're
in control now, yeah?

30:00.165 --> 30:01.466
Yes.
Good.
Let's go.

30:01.499 --> 30:01.937
Pass is in the window.

30:01.937 --> 30:02.500
Pass is in the window.

30:02.534 --> 30:03.635
There it is.

30:03.668 --> 30:05.136
Yes, got it up on time.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.806
I feel like once I kind of
learned my dishes,

30:07.839 --> 30:08.973
I was like,
"Come on, what's next?

30:09.007 --> 30:10.642
What's next?
Let's get it together?"

30:10.675 --> 30:12.577
127, go.
Yes.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.448
This is good.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.916
It's really good.

30:17.949 --> 30:19.851
What's going on now?

30:19.884 --> 30:21.853
It's vital to know
what's going on in the kitchen

30:21.886 --> 30:23.688
as an owner/operator.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.590
I shoulda done it
years ago.

30:25.623 --> 30:26.791
And thank you for coming out,

30:26.825 --> 30:30.361
and hopefully we see you
again soon.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.937
Okay, tonight you were good.

30:31.937 --> 30:32.363
Okay, tonight you were good.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.531
Thank you.

30:33.565 --> 30:35.233
But here's the bad news.

30:35.266 --> 30:38.670
I can't think
of a worse scenario

30:38.703 --> 30:40.605
than having lazy chefs.

30:40.638 --> 30:42.273
It is the quickest way

30:42.307 --> 30:44.075
of closing down
a business.

30:44.108 --> 30:48.046
I'm willing to work
with Arturo and Louis,

30:48.079 --> 30:50.315
but just everything
has to change.

30:53.117 --> 30:57.021
Lisa's ability to change

30:57.055 --> 30:59.457
has inspired Chef Ramsay

30:59.491 --> 31:01.259
to implement a change
of his own--

31:01.292 --> 31:01.937
a drastic remodel of Lido
that he and his team

31:01.937 --> 31:03.862
a drastic remodel of Lido
that he and his team

31:03.895 --> 31:05.897
work through the night
to complete.

31:07.899 --> 31:08.900
Good morning.

31:08.933 --> 31:10.168
Good morning.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.336
Today, big day.

31:11.369 --> 31:12.637
Lido is relaunching.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.038
Ready?
Yes.

31:14.072 --> 31:15.039
Do it, yes, yes.

31:15.073 --> 31:16.374
It's time to see
the new Lido.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.776
Let's go.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.078
Come in, come in,
come in.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.646
Wow!
Come in.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.681
Come in, come in,
come in, come over.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.884
Oh, my gosh.
Wow.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.418
It's beautiful.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.120
First thing,
that horrendous wall

31:29.153 --> 31:31.856
That was dividing
your restaurant has gone.

31:31.890 --> 31:31.937
Now the whole thing
just feels open.

31:31.937 --> 31:33.958
Now the whole thing
just feels open.

31:33.992 --> 31:35.426
Easier to get around.

31:35.460 --> 31:36.561
Wow, look at--

31:36.594 --> 31:38.096
Wow, that's so cool.

31:38.129 --> 31:39.631
- New seating.
- Brand-new.

31:39.664 --> 31:41.299
Check out the new China.

31:41.332 --> 31:42.901
No more hideous colors.

31:42.934 --> 31:44.269
All the plates

31:44.302 --> 31:46.037
and all the little
small bits of china

31:46.070 --> 31:47.972
were from  store.

31:48.006 --> 31:49.974
I was totally speechless.

31:50.008 --> 31:51.609
I love what they did
with the curtains,

31:51.643 --> 31:54.212
with the lighting,
with the pictures.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.914
One thing this area
hasn't got

31:55.947 --> 31:57.248
and one thing you've got

31:57.282 --> 31:59.217
every chance
of exceeding in

31:59.250 --> 32:01.185
is becoming Manhattan's,
yeah,

32:01.219 --> 32:01.937
local, cool, wine bar.

32:01.937 --> 32:04.188
local, cool, wine bar.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.790
Serving great food,

32:05.823 --> 32:08.259
great wines by the glasses,

32:08.293 --> 32:09.561
more importantly,

32:09.594 --> 32:11.129
a very cool place
to hang out.

32:11.162 --> 32:12.530
I think a wine bar

32:12.564 --> 32:14.766
is exactly
what Manhattan Beach needed.

32:14.799 --> 32:18.336
There's no place out there
around here

32:18.369 --> 32:19.771
that has that.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.172
One more little surprise.

32:21.205 --> 32:22.273
You've got to see these.

32:22.307 --> 32:24.609
The system before
was useless.

32:24.642 --> 32:28.112
This is phenomenal.

32:31.783 --> 32:31.937
I'm so happy right now.

32:31.937 --> 32:33.484
I'm so happy right now.

32:33.518 --> 32:34.686
Wow.

32:34.719 --> 32:36.688
I was so surprised
when I saw the new system.

32:36.721 --> 32:37.855
No way.

32:37.889 --> 32:39.057
I couldn't believe it.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.392
I was, ugh, in shock.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.628
This is designed by halo.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.830
This is the most advanced
restaurant P.O.S. system

32:45.863 --> 32:46.831
anywhere in the world.

32:46.864 --> 32:48.700
Wow!

32:48.733 --> 32:50.735
I believe in you.
I believe in the staff.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.070
You've got to pull this off.

32:52.103 --> 32:53.771
We will.
Oh, definitely.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.373
We have to.

32:55.406 --> 32:58.142
Not only will the new decor

32:58.176 --> 32:59.344
Be on display tonight,

32:59.377 --> 33:01.546
Chef Ramsay
has overhauled the food

33:01.579 --> 33:01.937
and designed an exciting
wine-friendly menu

33:01.937 --> 33:04.048
and designed an exciting
wine-friendly menu

33:04.082 --> 33:06.818
for what he is hoping
will be the new hot spot

33:06.851 --> 33:07.919
in Manhattan Beach.

33:07.952 --> 33:08.920
Wow.

33:08.953 --> 33:10.355
That's a lot of food.

33:10.388 --> 33:11.756
That's so pretty.

33:11.789 --> 33:12.824
Let's start off
from the top,

33:12.857 --> 33:13.992
the homemade
chicken sausage.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.259
Grilled baby artichokes.

33:15.293 --> 33:16.394
Vegetarian delight.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.895
One of my favorites,
the flatbreads.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.330
They are fantastic.

33:19.364 --> 33:20.999
You've got a chance

33:21.032 --> 33:22.100
to gain a serious reputation.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.468
Mm-hmm.
Right, entrees.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.370
The Lido burger.
Grilled minute steak.

33:25.403 --> 33:28.006
I think it's gonna be
a huge hit here.

33:28.039 --> 33:29.474
I love the new menu.

33:29.507 --> 33:30.975
It's so tasty.

33:31.009 --> 33:31.937
It's easy.

33:31.937 --> 33:32.143
It's easy.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.746
And I think it's perfect.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.819
Despite a poor performance
last evening,

33:41.853 --> 33:42.887
Lisa's hoping
her kitchen staff

33:42.920 --> 33:44.522
are motivated
by the changes,

33:44.555 --> 33:45.857
and that they will rise
to the occasion

33:45.890 --> 33:49.060
for the most important night
in Lido's history.

33:49.093 --> 33:51.129
One, two, three, Lido.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.330
Lido! Whoo!

33:52.363 --> 33:54.365
Let's do it.

33:54.399 --> 33:56.801
Welcome to the new Lido.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.003
Enjoy some wine tonight.
Yeah, that's right.
We will.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.772
This is our new menu.

34:00.805 --> 34:01.937
We have some
new appetizers also.

34:01.937 --> 34:02.640
We have some
new appetizers also.

34:02.674 --> 34:03.875
The minute steak.

34:03.908 --> 34:05.043
Okay, how would you like that
to be cooked?

34:05.076 --> 34:06.277
Can I have that rare, please?
Yeah.

34:08.413 --> 34:11.382
I'm so happy
with this computer.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.618
Okay, we got it, guys, yes?

34:13.651 --> 34:15.153
Yes.
Concentrate, guys, yeah?

34:20.158 --> 34:23.528
Louie, I need some stuff
coming out here, guys, yeah?

34:29.167 --> 34:30.635
In spite of
a new ordering system,

34:30.668 --> 34:31.937
30 minutes into service

34:31.937 --> 34:32.103
30 minutes into service

34:32.136 --> 34:34.205
no entrees have left
the kitchen,

34:34.238 --> 34:37.275
and there appears to be
a communication breakdown.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.243
What's happening here?
No one's even working together.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.279
It starts off from the chef
calling out the order.

34:41.312 --> 34:42.747
So away now, one scallop,
one fettuccini,

34:42.780 --> 34:45.083
one penne,
one grilled steak.

34:45.116 --> 34:46.884
Nobody answers me.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.153
Yes.
Yes, sir.

34:49.187 --> 34:51.689
I'm begging you
just to talk to each other.

34:51.723 --> 34:52.890
I'm begging!

34:52.924 --> 34:54.959
About the  menu
being put up together

34:54.992 --> 34:56.461
Collectively at the same time.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.763
That's what's not happening.

34:58.796 --> 35:01.265
I was a little nervous
right then

35:01.299 --> 35:01.937
because with my relaunch
I really wanted to run smooth.

35:01.937 --> 35:04.268
because with my relaunch
I really wanted to run smooth.

35:04.302 --> 35:06.804
Unfortunately,
there's no communication.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.707
It's awful.

35:09.741 --> 35:11.342
Unbelievable.

35:11.375 --> 35:12.910
Dining room looks
absolutely beautiful.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.378
Fine, great, granted.

35:14.412 --> 35:16.614
But the kitchen,
an absolute  disaster.

35:16.647 --> 35:18.750
Five headless chickens

35:18.783 --> 35:20.451
with not an ounce
of leadership qualities.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.587
Right now I'm depending
on a 28-year-old lady

35:22.620 --> 35:24.222
to save her restaurant,

35:24.255 --> 35:26.324
the biggest test
of her career so far.

35:26.357 --> 35:28.192
Okay, they're done.

35:28.226 --> 35:29.961
60 minutes into service,

35:29.994 --> 35:31.937
The kitchen staff
is finally communicating

35:31.937 --> 35:32.196
The kitchen staff
is finally communicating

35:32.230 --> 35:33.464
and sending out entrees.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.867
However, they are not
being well-received

35:35.900 --> 35:38.603
by the dining room.

35:38.636 --> 35:41.072
Are you serious?

35:43.107 --> 35:44.408
I need 115

35:44.442 --> 35:45.877
and 60.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.478
All of these steaks
are cold.

35:47.512 --> 35:49.714
Oh, come on, guys..

35:49.747 --> 35:52.917
They're overcooked as well.

35:52.950 --> 35:55.753
Listen to me,
when a minute steak is cooked,

35:55.787 --> 35:56.988
it's got to be served
right away.

35:57.021 --> 35:58.856
You can't hold
a minute steak.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.591
Three steaks on the fly
as quick as you can.

36:00.625 --> 36:01.826
When people
are getting their food,

36:01.859 --> 36:01.937
they're getting undercooked,
overcooked,

36:01.937 --> 36:04.295
they're getting undercooked,
overcooked,

36:04.328 --> 36:05.530
still sending it back.

36:05.563 --> 36:06.998
They want a whole new steak.

36:07.031 --> 36:08.599
, there's more food
going in the  trash

36:08.633 --> 36:10.334
Than there is
going on the  table.

36:10.368 --> 36:11.836
We either need our food
in, like, five minutes,

36:11.869 --> 36:13.171
or our check.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.739
90 minutes into relaunch,

36:14.772 --> 36:16.808
Diners are fed up
with not being fed.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.576
So if you don't wanna wait--

36:18.609 --> 36:20.478
And Lisa is desperate

36:20.511 --> 36:21.946
for her kitchen
to bounce back.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.581
Oh, my God.

36:23.614 --> 36:26.450
Look at that.

36:26.484 --> 36:29.654
Those are the tickets?

36:29.687 --> 36:31.322
They don't know what
the  they're doing.

36:31.355 --> 36:31.937
Are you kidding me right now?
This is ridiculous.

36:31.937 --> 36:33.991
Are you kidding me right now?
This is ridiculous.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.328
Like, I just couldn't believe
the ignorance back there.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.864
What are you doing?

36:39.897 --> 36:42.733
Why aren't you making food?
Why are you standing here?

36:44.535 --> 36:45.636
You're just looking
at tickets.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.938
Make some  food.

36:46.971 --> 36:49.173
I don't understand.
Please.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.908
Arturo, will you please
tell her to make some food?

36:50.942 --> 36:52.610
Lisa, I'm trying right now.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.545
I'm doing my stuff too.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.853
They're just all
standing there.

37:01.886 --> 37:01.937
They're not
doing anything.

37:01.937 --> 37:03.321
They're not
doing anything.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.990
And getting paid
as well.

37:06.023 --> 37:08.626
Damn it.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.669
They're--
they're leaving.

37:18.703 --> 37:19.871
Who?
Who's leaving?

37:19.904 --> 37:20.872
The cooks.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.506
Why?

37:22.540 --> 37:23.975
Oh, my God.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.009
Hello?

37:25.042 --> 37:26.644
We're giving up.
Bye.
Arturo--

37:26.677 --> 37:28.012
We're giving up.
I know you're giving up.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.381
Why?
Why?

37:30.414 --> 37:31.937
Is this what they do?

37:31.937 --> 37:32.149
Is this what they do?

37:32.183 --> 37:33.150
Louie!

37:33.184 --> 37:34.518
Louie!

37:34.552 --> 37:36.354
On my biggest night,

37:36.387 --> 37:38.723
they walked out.

37:38.756 --> 37:39.857
Please, guys.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.893
Louie!

37:52.970 --> 37:54.672
They're--
they're leaving.

37:54.705 --> 37:56.507
Who's leaving?

37:56.540 --> 37:57.942
Oh, my God.

37:57.975 --> 37:59.677
It's relaunch night at Lido's,

37:59.710 --> 38:01.545
And the only thing
that's taken off

38:01.579 --> 38:03.180
is the kitchen staff.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.684
Louie!
Louie!

38:06.717 --> 38:08.319
Please, guys.

38:08.352 --> 38:11.021
For them to walk out like that
with all those tickets,

38:11.055 --> 38:13.490
like, I wasn't sure what to do
or what to expect.

38:13.524 --> 38:14.758
The head chef
after 18 years

38:14.792 --> 38:15.997
bails out.

38:15.997 --> 38:16.026
bails out.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.229
That's  spineless.

38:21.765 --> 38:23.534
Hello.
Scott, it's Gordon.

38:23.567 --> 38:26.103
Listen,
I need you right now.

38:26.136 --> 38:28.138
Jump in the car
and get down here quickly,

38:28.172 --> 38:29.974
will you please?

38:32.142 --> 38:33.444
Lisa, I've just phoned Scott.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.446
I told him
to jump in his car,

38:35.479 --> 38:37.348
and he's getting down here.

38:37.381 --> 38:38.682
Chef Scott's been
my right-hand man

38:38.716 --> 38:40.217
for the last five years,
okay?

38:40.251 --> 38:42.253
I've asked him to be here
as your consultant

38:42.286 --> 38:44.421
for the next month
to oversee this  place.

38:44.455 --> 38:45.856
He's gonna jump
on the service

38:45.890 --> 38:45.997
and get this place
up to speed.

38:45.997 --> 38:47.291
and get this place
up to speed.

38:47.324 --> 38:49.994
We cannot afford
to let this place go down.

38:50.027 --> 38:51.028
No chance.

38:53.664 --> 38:54.999
With an empty kitchen

38:55.032 --> 38:56.467
and a full dining room,

38:56.500 --> 38:59.303
relaunch night at Lido's
is heading towards disaster.

38:59.336 --> 39:01.372
I don't even know
what to do.

39:01.405 --> 39:02.773
Even though Chef Scott
is en route...

39:02.806 --> 39:04.241
You're all running away
like cowards.

39:04.275 --> 39:05.676
Gordon makes one more attempt

39:05.709 --> 39:07.278
to get the kitchen staff
to return.

39:07.311 --> 39:10.247
- Hey, Louie.
- Yeah, we need you.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.750
Louie!

39:12.783 --> 39:14.985
This is music to my ears.

39:17.421 --> 39:18.856
Thank you, Arturo.

39:21.992 --> 39:22.960
Okay, Scott.
Arturo.

39:22.993 --> 39:24.662
Scott's here.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.096
Yeah, look it,
he's here to help.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.065
Let's lift it up.

39:28.098 --> 39:29.833
And let's get this
back together, yes? Okay.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.236
Okay, here we go,
listen up, everybody.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.138
I need a prosciutto pizza
in the oven.

39:34.171 --> 39:35.639
I need one more order
of barbecue chicken.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.808
I need a lamb sandwich
up top right now.

39:37.841 --> 39:39.543
To see Scott in the kitchen,

39:39.576 --> 39:41.545
like, take command
the way he did,

39:41.578 --> 39:43.714
it shows what a head chef
should be doing.

39:43.747 --> 39:45.349
Hey, is that prosciutto pizza
in the oven?

39:45.382 --> 39:45.997
Yeah.

39:45.997 --> 39:46.650
Yeah.

39:46.684 --> 39:47.751
Okay, how much, three minutes?
Four minutes?

39:47.785 --> 39:49.053
Three minutes.

39:49.086 --> 39:50.354
I saw communication
I'd never seen

39:50.387 --> 39:51.989
in that kitchen before
with Scott at the reins.

39:52.022 --> 39:54.191
Okay, let's pick up
,

39:54.224 --> 39:55.826
Rosemary chicken,
steak medium rare,

39:55.859 --> 39:57.061
going with
the prosciutto pizza.

39:57.094 --> 39:58.495
Table 106.

39:58.529 --> 39:59.797
Thank you.

39:59.830 --> 40:00.965
Yay!

40:00.998 --> 40:02.466
Chef Scott helped the kitchen

40:02.499 --> 40:03.567
Make a massive comeback.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.703
I have a cran,
two tartare,

40:05.736 --> 40:07.237
and asparagus quiche.

40:07.271 --> 40:09.506
And the evening
ended successfully.

40:09.540 --> 40:10.975
Wow.
How's your steak?

40:11.008 --> 40:12.009
Excellent.

40:12.042 --> 40:13.444
That's good.

40:13.477 --> 40:15.245
I think tonight overall

40:15.279 --> 40:15.997
was a good
learning experience.

40:15.997 --> 40:16.880
was a good
learning experience.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.716
Thank you, guys.

40:18.749 --> 40:21.285
Okay, and you're my last table
served tonight, so...

40:21.318 --> 40:24.221
I'm looking forward
to talking with Gordon

40:24.254 --> 40:26.590
about what I should do
in moving forward

40:26.623 --> 40:27.925
with this restaurant,

40:27.958 --> 40:29.893
because
we really, really need

40:29.927 --> 40:31.795
a solid kitchen staff.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.435
Okay, Lisa, honestly,

40:38.469 --> 40:40.838
you have seriously
grown up this week

40:40.871 --> 40:43.073
more than I ever
expected you to do.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.976
You show such commitment.

40:46.010 --> 40:48.112
You do your homework,
you show up on time,

40:48.145 --> 40:51.582
and more importantly,
you are a very fast learner.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.417
However, it's not the same
with the team.

40:53.450 --> 40:55.519
Your kitchen staff

40:55.552 --> 40:57.321
in a normal situation
would have been expelled.

40:57.354 --> 40:58.555
Them walking out like that

40:58.589 --> 41:00.224
in the middle of service
was disgusting.

41:00.257 --> 41:02.593
I 100% agree.
That was horrible.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.963
Your dream effectively
is in their hands.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.898
I was so disappointed tonight.

41:07.931 --> 41:09.633
I can't put up
with that.

41:09.666 --> 41:11.835
I'm not sure
whether Louis and Arturo

41:11.869 --> 41:13.704
are gonna be part
of the new Lido.

41:13.737 --> 41:15.997
But now that I have
a much better understanding

41:15.997 --> 41:16.673
But now that I have
a much better understanding

41:16.707 --> 41:17.841
from Gordon,

41:17.875 --> 41:20.010
I am going to really embrace

41:20.044 --> 41:21.245
these changes

41:21.278 --> 41:23.247
and make this place
successful.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.515
I am so impressed

41:24.548 --> 41:27.584
by the way you've handled
what you had to do

41:27.618 --> 41:29.386
in this short
period of time.

41:29.420 --> 41:33.290
You stay in control,
and you hold the reins firmly.

41:33.323 --> 41:34.691
I seriously believe in you.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.093
Thank you.

41:36.126 --> 41:37.294
I can't wait to come back.

41:37.327 --> 41:38.695
Can't wait to have you back.

41:38.729 --> 41:40.064
I'll be your honor student.

41:40.097 --> 41:41.398
When Gordon walks
back in here,

41:41.432 --> 41:43.333
whenever he comes back in
months from now

41:43.367 --> 41:45.836
and sees this restaurant
buzzing,

41:45.869 --> 41:45.997
that's gonna be
my proudest moment.

41:45.997 --> 41:47.671
that's gonna be
my proudest moment.

41:47.704 --> 41:49.173
Good night.
Well done, my darling.

41:49.206 --> 41:51.008
Well done.
Thank you so much.

41:51.041 --> 41:52.409
Good luck.
Spend time in that kitchen.

41:52.443 --> 41:53.911
Oh, I will.
Okay.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.879
Thank you.

41:59.249 --> 42:00.551
Tonight was actually
the first night

42:00.584 --> 42:02.219
this place felt
like Lisa's restaurant.

42:02.252 --> 42:04.221
Sadly, there are still
leftovers from the past

42:04.254 --> 42:05.589
that keep on
dragging her down,

42:05.622 --> 42:08.025
and for her to move on
and be a success,

42:08.058 --> 42:10.360
she has to drop
her excess baggage

42:10.394 --> 42:12.129
and move on.

42:12.162 --> 42:14.565
What the  was on
in that bathroom?

42:18.902 --> 42:20.737
After Gordon left,

42:20.771 --> 42:22.372
in the days that followed,

42:22.406 --> 42:24.942
Scott took the next month
to train a newly motivated

42:24.975 --> 42:27.478
Louis and Arturo.

42:27.511 --> 42:29.012
That's for the clams
and mussels.
Yeah.

42:29.046 --> 42:31.081
Keep it here, right?
Yeah, that's fine.
No problem.

42:31.115 --> 42:32.749
Welcome to the new Lido.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.985
And with Lisa's
new found kitchen expertise...

42:35.018 --> 42:37.721
From now on, 100%,
just come straight to me.

42:37.854 --> 42:40.157
I can listen
and make changes.

42:40.190 --> 42:42.292
Manhattan Beach's
newest wine bar

42:42.326 --> 42:44.027
has seen a boost
in revenue.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.997
I learned so much
from Gordon Ramsay.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.364
I learned so much
from Gordon Ramsay.

42:47.397 --> 42:49.433
The whole experience
has been amazing.

42:49.466 --> 42:52.302
Like, it's--
it's life-changing, really.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.471
This man has given us
everything,

42:54.504 --> 42:57.240
all the tools in the world

42:57.274 --> 42:59.876
like a dream come true.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.211
Now let's do it.

43:01.244 --> 43:03.246
I really feel like
I do own the role

43:03.280 --> 43:06.351
of being
the restaurant owner now.
