watching the news.

illness which is sweeping
the country...

15:03.208 --> 15:04.458
Oops!

15:07.458 --> 15:10.000
You got something
to say to me, chere?

15:10.000 --> 15:14.250
What if I'd been lying
about not being able to
touch another human being?

15:14.250 --> 15:17.083
What if I could,
if I wanted to?

15:17.083 --> 15:19.083
What's this
supposed to
mean to me?

15:21.583 --> 15:24.500
Come up to the rec room
in five minutes and
I'll show you.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.083
If they're going to
treat me like a kid,

15:35.083 --> 15:37.500
they could at least
keep some junk food
in the house.

15:37.500 --> 15:42.375
Jubilee, we have information
that a violent anti-mutant
attack is expected

15:42.375 --> 15:43.875
at the mutant
halfway house.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.833
What can I do?

15:45.833 --> 15:49.125
Go and report
back what you find.
Here's the address.

15:49.125 --> 15:50.958
I know I can
count on you.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.125
Thanks, Storm!

15:53.125 --> 15:55.833
I'm glad someone around here
thinks I'm not
just a little kid.

15:57.625 --> 16:01.291
That's for thinking
you could take my place.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.833
Look like I keep
you waiting too long.

16:13.833 --> 16:17.875
Or maybe you just want me
to wake you up with a kiss.

Why, yes!
Won't you come in?

There are new reports

16:47.291 --> 16:49.416

as a night of violence
continues across America.

ROGUE:
You can't say
I didn't warn him!

16:51.708 --> 16:53.583
What happened, Rogue?

16:53.583 --> 16:56.708
The blamed fool kissed me
and I absorbed
all his powers.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.625
Serves him right.

16:58.625 --> 17:01.291
But the worst thing is,
this keeps happening!

17:05.708 --> 17:10.291
Gambit,
you could not have chosen
a worse time to be a fool.

17:10.291 --> 17:15.833
Jubilee? Jubilee?
Could Jubilee have
left without telling us?

17:15.833 --> 17:19.500
Something screwy's going on
around here. Where's Beast?

17:19.500 --> 17:22.000
I think he's in
the Danger Room.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.458
You and Rogue fly on ahead,

17:24.458 --> 17:26.708
