HAS NO ANGLES

OF THE SHOOTING
OR THE ROOFI'OP,
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?

RECOGNITION ON EVERYONE

05:15.010 --> 05:16.648
IN AND AROUND

05:16.680 --> 05:19.979
TO SEE IF THEY MATCH
ANY LOOSE ENDS
FROM MORGAN'S ABDUCTION.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.647
HOW DID HE TAKE IT?

05:21.680 --> 05:23.011
AS EXPECTED.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.347
SIR, I KNOW THAT WHEN
MORGAN WAS ON LEAVE

05:24.390 --> 05:27.018
AFI'ER HIS ABDUCTION,
YOU ENCOURAGED HIM
TO STAY AWAY FROM THE CASE.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.618
AND LET ME GUESS--
HE DIDN'T.

05:28.660 --> 05:30.582
WE ALL KNEW IN OUR HEARTS
IT WASN'T OVER,

05:30.630 --> 05:33.451
AND, LOOK, WE WERE RIGHT,
SO IN AN EXTRA-CURRICULAR
KIND OF WAY

05:33.500 --> 05:35.821
WE KEPT SLEUTHING
TO SEE WHO WAS WORKING
WITH JOHN BRADLEY.

05:35.860 --> 05:38.420
BEFORE HE CAME BACK TO WORK,
MORGAN SAID THAT
HE'D FOUND A CONNECTION

05:38.470 --> 05:40.495
BETWEEN THE MEN
WHO HELD HIM AT THE CABIN
AND THE MONTOLO FAMILY.

05:40.540 --> 05:43.100
RIGHT. SO, BASICALLY,
WE'RE DEALING WITH
A BIG CRIME FAMILY TREE,

05:43.140 --> 05:45.631
OF WHICH BRADLEY
WAS CERTAINLY A BRANCH.

05:45.670 --> 05:47.433
AND THE MONTOLOS HAD HIRED
HIM MULTIPLE TIMES.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.674
DID YOU SCAN THE DRAWING?
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

05:48.710 --> 05:51.645
SO, HAS EVERYONE
BEEN WORKING ON THIS?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.910

YEAH, BASICALLY.

PLUS OUR BAD GUYS/GALS

OFF THE EVIL TABLE.

FOR FAMILY TRAUMA,

06:06.090 --> 06:06.954
AND EACH LINE
IS LIKE THAT.

THE SHORTEST OF THEM ALL.

THE ONLY LIVING CHILD OF
CHAZZ AND ROSEMARY MONTOLO.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.990
ROSEMARY DIED WHEN GIUSEPPE
WAS JUST A BOY.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.565
RIGHT. AND THEN GIUSEPPE
WENT TO LIVE WITH
HIS FAMILY IN ITALY,

06:15.600 --> 06:17.761
AND CHAZZ WENT OFF
TO BUILD A CRIMINAL EMPIRE.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.131
LOOKS LIKE CHAZZ MONTOLO
WAS KILLED LAST YEAR.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.738
YEAH, IN A BANK FIRE
IN GERMANY.

06:21.780 --> 06:24.408
GOT POSITIVE I.D.
ON THE DENTAL
AND FINGERPRINTS.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.918

HIS SON WAS MURDERED.

WHAT IF THAT'S NOT
A COINCIDENCE?

06:28.950 --> 06:31.441
SO WHOEVER POISONED
THE SON ALSO KILLED
THE FATHER.

06:31.490 --> 06:35.017

OF THIS.

11:26.410 --> 11:27.570

WAS TO KILL HER,

WHY WOULD HE SHOOT HER
AT A PLACE WHERE
SHE COULD BE SAVED?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.812

WASN'T TO KILL HER.

11:38.190 --> 11:41.023

11:47.840 --> 11:51.059
I JUST WASN'T FOCUSED
ENOUGH AT THE TIME
TO FLAG IT.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.361
DO WE HAVE
ANY LEADS?

11:52.410 --> 11:54.207
GIUSEPPE MONTOLO'S FATHER.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.037
CHAZZ MONTOLO.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.447
HE WANTS ME TO FEEL
HOW HE FEELS.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.347
HOW DID I DO?

12:31.180 --> 12:32.977
HOTCH KNOW YOU'RE HERE?

12:34.450 --> 12:37.817
I DON'T AGREE WITH
TAKING YOU OFF THE CASE.

12:37.850 --> 12:40.819
WHEN SOMEONE HURTS
ONE OF US,

12:40.860 --> 12:45.786
WHEN SOMEONE HURTS
A BABY...

12:47.400 --> 12:50.119
YEAH.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.462
UH, I NEED TO SHOW THIS
TO THE TEAM,

12:59.510 --> 13:02.331
BUT I WANTED YOU
TO SEE IT FIRST.

13:02.380 --> 13:06.407
I FOUND IT IN THE PAY PHONE
HE USED TO CALL GARCIA.

13:08.620 --> 13:11.885
"HOW DOES IT FEEL?

13:11.920 --> 13:14.559
"DO YOU SEE RED?

13:14.590 --> 13:17.582
I SEE RED."

13:17.630 --> 13:20.224
DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

13:32.210 --> 13:34.132
NO.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.944
YOU SURE?

13:38.410 --> 13:40.947
YEAH.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.880

14:17.690 --> 14:20.284
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
LIKE THIS.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.959
I WANT TO FIX IT
AND I CAN'T.

14:22.990 --> 14:24.457
IT'S TOO MUCH
FOR ANYONE.

14:24.490 --> 14:27.197
IT'S NOT FAIR
AND IT NEEDS TO STOP.

14:27.230 --> 14:29.528

14:49.450 --> 14:51.589
I SHOWED IT TO MORGAN.

14:51.620 --> 14:54.487
WHAT DID HE SAY?

14:54.520 --> 14:57.557
SAME AS US.
IT'S A TAUNT.

14:57.590 --> 14:59.455
MM-HMM.
THAT'S ALL?

14:59.490 --> 15:03.620
AND I'M SORRY.
I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.422
IT'S OK.

15:05.470 --> 15:08.667
WHERE ARE WE WITH
THE MOTELS AND THE SROS
ALONG THE BUS ROUTE?

FACELESS TENANTS.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.934
I'LL GET THE WASHINGTON
FIELD OFFICE
TO CANVASS THE AREA.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.471
WHY LEAVE A NOTE
SO SEEMINGLY ON THE NOSE

15:16.510 --> 15:19.946
WHEN EVERY OTHER ACTION
HAS BEEN CALCULATED
FOR MAXIMUM PAIN?

15:19.980 --> 15:22.710
IT HAS TO MEAN MORE THAN
SIMPLY "I'M ANGRY."

15:22.750 --> 15:26.516
IT'S A CLUE OR A SYMBOL.
IT MEANS SOMETHING TO MORGAN
AND I THINK CHAZZ KNOWS THAT.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.553
WELL, HE WANTS TO DRIVE
MORGAN TO EXACT REVENGE.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.319

HE'S DOING?

THE QUESTIONS.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.068

WHAT TO SAY.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.274

15:55.550 --> 15:59.088

WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.611
I DON'T KNOW.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.149
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR
MICROEXPRESSIONS.

16:06.190 --> 16:09.648
YOU DIVIDED THIS TEAM

TOGETHER.

YOU DID.

IT'S THE DOCTOR.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.601

16:58.650 --> 17:01.414
THIS SHOULD BE ME.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.748
AND I'M SO SORRY.

17:18.730 --> 17:20.766

17:20.800 --> 17:22.688

CALLING HIM.

17:23.970 --> 17:26.530

18:31.310 --> 18:33.278
ABOUT A MILE AWAY
FROM THE HOSPITAL
AND THEN HE STOPS.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.369
HE GOT RID OF HIS PHONE.
WHY WOULD HE STOP?

18:35.410 --> 18:38.243

TO KILL HIM.

WHO TO KILL FIRST.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.568
WHAT DO YOU
CHOOSE TO BELIEVE?

20:21.780 --> 20:25.511
THAT YOU'RE A NARCISSISTIC
HOMICIDAL PSYCHOPATH.

20:25.550 --> 20:28.314
AND YOU CAN'T STAND
THE FACT THAT YOU FAILED
6 MONTHS AGO,

I BELIEVE.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.859
YOU KILLED MY SON.

20:35.900 --> 20:37.322

20:37.370 --> 20:39.463
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON
THAT SAW HIM ALIVE.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.434
YES, I WAS, BUT SOMEONE
ELSE POISONED HIM.

20:41.470 --> 20:43.028
HOW DID HE END UP
IN PRISON?

20:43.070 --> 20:44.708

21:13.540 --> 21:15.394

WHEN WE LOST HIM.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.000
THERE ARE 3 HIGHWAYS
IN THAT DIRECTION.
HE COULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.008
EXCEPT MONTOLO
NEVER LEFT THE CITY.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.770

21:29.420 --> 21:31.684

DOES THAT MEAN?

21:36.790 --> 21:38.553

21:38.590 --> 21:41.627

21:48.840 --> 21:52.037
DO YOU EVER COUNT
HOW MANY CHOICES
YOU MAKE IN A DAY?

21:52.070 --> 21:55.506
THE FIRST IS WHETHER
OR NOT TO GET OUT OF BED
IN THE MORNING.

21:55.540 --> 22:02.116
WHEN GIUSEPPE DIED,
I REALLY STRUGGLED
WITH THAT ONE.

22:17.970 --> 22:21.462
FIND YOUR STILLNESS.

22:21.500 --> 22:25.869
YOU KNOW, ANOTHER CHOICE
I MADE WAS TO STICK
WITH WHAT WORKS.

22:25.910 --> 22:30.870
AND THIS, FOR ME, WORKS.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.541

CALLS ME AARON.
WHY WOULD HE START?

23:22.960 --> 23:24.461
WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY?

23:24.500 --> 23:25.967
THAT OF ALL PEOPLE,
I SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.797
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT FOYET.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.035
YES. BUT HE MENTIONED
THAT EARLIER. WHY WOULD
HE BRING IT UP AGAIN?

23:30.070 --> 23:33.198
HE WANTED YOU TO RELATE
TO HIS RAGE AND BACK OFF?

23:33.240 --> 23:36.107
IS THERE ANY OTHER
RELEVANCE TO FOYET?

23:36.140 --> 23:37.971
HE ATTACKED IN MY HOME.

23:38.010 --> 23:40.149
MAYBE MORGAN SUBCONSCIOUSLY
LET THAT SLIP.

23:40.180 --> 23:41.943
YEAH, BUT MORGAN'S
HOUSE ISN'T RED.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.880
YEAH, BUT HE'S RENOVATED
A LOT OF HOUSES OVER THE YEARS.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.444
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE?

23:45.490 --> 23:47.788
YEAH.

23:51.860 --> 23:55.489
YOU KNOW, I COULD HAVE
SHOT HER WHEN YOU WERE
FAR AWAY FROM HELP,

23:55.530 --> 23:57.464
BUT I GAVE HER A CHANCE.

23:58.970 --> 24:00.858
I MADE THAT CHOICE.

24:00.900 --> 24:02.458
THINK ABOUT IT.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.804
YOU'RE INSANE.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.206
MAYBE.

24:07.240 --> 24:11.472
YOU KNOW, I LEARNED A LOT
BY LIVING IN THESE WALLS
THAT YOU BUILT.

24:11.510 --> 24:15.742
FOR EXAMPLE,
AT FIRST, IT WAS ABOUT
CHANGING THE PAST,

24:15.780 --> 24:17.486
THE POWER
OF TRANSFORMATION.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.239
BELIEVING THAT ANYTHING
CAN BE FIXED.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.851
AND THEN YOU FINISHED
THE RENOVATION.

24:23.890 --> 24:28.054
AND YOU DECIDED
TO STUDY BEHAVIOR.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.897

24:29.930 --> 24:31.591
FOR A LIVING.

24:31.630 --> 24:34.133

MANY YEARS LATER

24:34.170 --> 24:35.899
YOU CROSSED PATHS
WITH MY SON.

24:35.940 --> 24:40.058
SO THE DECISIONS YOU MADE
IN TH ESE VERY WALLS

24:40.110 --> 24:43.136
WERE THE BEGINNING
OF OUR JOURNEY.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.740

24:47.780 --> 24:49.077

24:49.120 --> 24:52.578
HE STARTED RENOVATING
IN 2001 RIGHT AFTER 9-11.

24:52.620 --> 24:55.259
I REMEMBER HIM SAYING
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO WITH HIS FRUSTRATION.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.554
HE THOUGHT TEARING DOWN WALLS
WOULD BE A GOOD START.

24:57.590 --> 25:00.024
HE WANTED TO RESTORE
THEM SO HE COULD
CONTROL SOMETHING.

25:00.060 --> 25:02.756
COULD MONTOLO
KNOW ABOUT THESE HOUSES?
