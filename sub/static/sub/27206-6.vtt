THE JIM BEAM DISTILLERY
IN CLERMONT, KENTUCKY,

01:31.658 --> 01:35.327
IS HOME TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S
MOST RENOWNED BOURBONS.

500 ACRES OF BLUEGRASS HILLS,

HALF A MILLION BARRELS

ON THAT SIDE OVER THERE.

THE MASTER BEDROOM THERE.

WHO DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE?

LIVED HERE,

NOTABLE PEOPLE.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.519
IS ALL THE STORIES

FROM SO MANY
DIFFERENT PEOPLE --

AS LONG AS YOU'VE BEEN HERE

08:15.929 --> 08:18.063

08:18.065 --> 08:20.531
THAT WAS HERE BEFORE
THIS WAREHOUSE WAS BUILT.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.133
THERE WAS A FIRE
ON THAT PROPERTY.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.301
THAT HOUSE
WAS THEN REMOVED,

08:23.303 --> 08:25.003
AND THIS WAREHOUSE
WAS BUILT OVER IT.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.938

PASSED AWAY IN THAT FIRE.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.540
DO WE HAVE ANY, I MEAN,
HISTORICAL DOCUMENTATION

08:29.542 --> 08:30.875

THAT HAPPENED?

AND THEY'VE SEEN A SPIRIT
OF A LADY STANDING RIGHT HERE.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.117
AND SUDDENLY,
ROB IS SAYING RIGHT NOW

38:41.119 --> 38:42.919
THAT HE SEES A MIST
ON HIS CAMERA.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.821
THIS MIST LOOKS LIKE
IT SUDDENLY FORMS

38:44.823 --> 38:47.690
AND MOVES DOWN THE AISLE
PAST THE BARRELS OF BOURBON

38:47.692 --> 38:50.926
AND JUST MOVES IN BETWEEN THEM
REALLY QUICKLY.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.929
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
-WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

38:55.367 --> 38:58.968
Nick: OVER HERE
I HEARD SOMETHING.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.970
OH!

39:00.972 --> 39:02.038
-I SMELL THAT.
-SMELL.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.908
OH, IS THAT THE FLORAL?

39:05.910 --> 39:07.576
DO YOU SMELL THAT?
IT'S REALLY STRONG.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.746
IT'S, LIKE,
THE FLORAL SCENT.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.881
Rob:
I SMELL, LIKE...

39:11.883 --> 39:14.049
I SMELL, LIKE, PERFUME
OR SOME [BLEEP].

39:14.051 --> 39:16.085
IT'S FLOWERS.
IT'S WHAT THEY SMELL HERE.

39:16.087 --> 39:19.723
OVER HERE
I DON'T SMELL IT.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.058
YEAH, YOU SMELL
WHISKEY OVER HERE.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.260
Katrina: WE'RE IN A WAREHOUSE
FULL OF BOURBON.

39:24.262 --> 39:26.730
ALL YOU SMELL IN HERE
IS BOURBON,

39:26.732 --> 39:31.067
AND IT'S AN OVERWHELMING
SMELL OF FLOWERS.

39:31.069 --> 39:34.069
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT MANY
EMPLOYEES HAVE EXPERIENCED HERE.

39:34.071 --> 39:36.139
STEPHANIE ACTUALLY
WARNED US ABOUT THAT.

39:36.141 --> 39:41.544
SO FOR FLOWERS TO BE COMING ON,
AND OUT OF NOWHERE --

39:41.546 --> 39:43.847
I DON'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION
FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.282
Nick: BEFORE WE LEAVE, KATRINA
AND I MEET WITH STEPHANIE

39:46.284 --> 39:50.153
TO SHARE THE FINDINGS
OF OUR 72-HOUR INVESTIGATION.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.420
-HEY, STEPHANIE.
-HI.

39:51.422 --> 39:52.622
-GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
-GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.957
-GOOD MORNING.
-GOOD MORNING.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.158
Nick: WE HAD A TON OF
EXPERIENCES HAPPEN.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.292
THAT'S GREAT.

39:56.294 --> 39:57.927
AND WE HAD THE BULK
OF OUR EXPERIENCES

39:57.929 --> 40:00.296
IN THE SPACE UPSTAIRS
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

40:00.298 --> 40:01.965
SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW US...
ABSOLUTELY. LET'S DO IT.

40:01.967 --> 40:03.666
....WE CAN KIND OF
WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

40:06.704 --> 40:09.539
Nick: WE SMELLED THIS PERFUME
SMELL RIGHT HERE IN THIS AREA.

40:09.541 --> 40:10.640
Stephanie:
MM-HMM.

40:10.642 --> 40:11.975
WE TRIED TO FIND
A NATURAL CAUSE FOR IT,

40:11.977 --> 40:13.576
BUT IT'S A WAREHOUSE
FULL OF BOURBON.

40:13.578 --> 40:14.777
YES.

40:14.779 --> 40:16.111
SO I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT WOULD ALL OF A SUDDEN,

40:16.113 --> 40:17.881
JUST IN ONE SPOT,
SMELL LIKE FLOWERS.

40:17.883 --> 40:20.082
ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S THE MOST
COMMONLY REPORTED THING

40:20.084 --> 40:21.351
WE GET OUT OF K

40:21.353 --> 40:23.052
IS THE SMELLING OF
THE PERFUME MOVING AROUND.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.353
RIGHT WHERE
THE BARRELS START,

40:24.355 --> 40:27.456
ROB ACTUALLY SAW
ON HIS CAMERA A MIST FORM.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.259
I PERSONALLY SAW IT TWICE.
YEAH.

40:29.261 --> 40:30.326
THE BEST WAY
I CAN DESCRIBE IT --

40:30.328 --> 40:31.861
LIKE A REALLY THIN CLOUD.
MM-HMM.

40:31.863 --> 40:35.331
IT HAD SHAPE TO IT.
IT WAS VERY WEIRD.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.266
YEAH, IT'S INTERESTING
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

40:37.268 --> 40:41.037
WHO OR WHAT THESE ENERGIES ARE.
YES. MM-HMM.

40:41.039 --> 40:43.406
SO THE TWO WAREHOUSES --
D AND K --

40:43.408 --> 40:44.874
DEFINITELY HAVE
DIFFERENT ENERGIES.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.209
D CAN KIND OF CATCH YOU
OFF GUARD AT TIMES

40:47.211 --> 40:49.345
BECAUSE IT'S MORE AGGRESSIVE.
ABSOLUTELY.

40:49.347 --> 40:50.746
BUT IT'S NOTHING BAD.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.948
IT SEEMS MAYBE IT'S MORE OF
LIKE A PROTECTIVE

40:52.950 --> 40:54.984
OWNERSHIP, MANAGEMENT
KIND OF FEEL...

40:54.986 --> 40:56.185
MM-HMM.

40:56.187 --> 40:58.321
...WHERE HERE, I'M NOT SURE
IF IT'S MORE OF

40:58.323 --> 40:59.556
SOMEBODY TRYING TO
GET THEIR MESSAGE ACROSS --

40:59.558 --> 41:01.758
MAYBE SOMETHING
THAT WE WERE NOT AWARE OF,

41:01.760 --> 41:03.159
AND IT'S TRYING
TO TELL THEIR STORY...

41:03.161 --> 41:04.393
MM-HMM.

41:04.395 --> 41:06.095
...OR IF YOU JUST HAVE
MULTIPLE ENERGIES

41:06.097 --> 41:07.363
COMING INTO PLAY HERE

41:07.365 --> 41:10.132
WHERE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S
DISCONNECTED FROM EACH OTHER.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.701
BUT I THINK WHAT NICK AND I,
YOU KNOW, DISCOVERED

41:12.703 --> 41:16.306
IS THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
SOMETHING IN THESE BUILDINGS.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.141
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT LINGERS BEHIND.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.575
YOU GUYS HAD
THE SAME THINGS HAPPEN

41:19.577 --> 41:20.577
THAT WE'VE ALL HAD HAPPEN,

41:20.579 --> 41:22.846
AND IT'S REALLY NICE TO,
YOU KNOW,

41:22.848 --> 41:24.847
JUST HAVE THAT, YOU KNOW,
CONFIRMATION

41:24.849 --> 41:26.115
THAT YOU GUYS SAW IT, TOO.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.117
WHEN PEOPLE LIKE BECKY
HAVE THEIR EXPERIENCES,

41:28.119 --> 41:29.318
THEY'RE NOT CRAZY.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.120
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE,

41:31.122 --> 41:33.222
SOMETHING INTERACTING.
IT INTERACTED WITH US.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.957
THIS LOCATION HAS
SO MUCH HISTORY.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.225
IT'S VERY ICONIC.

41:36.227 --> 41:39.595
AND WITHOUT THE SPIRITS
THAT WERE HERE

41:39.597 --> 41:43.199
ONCE LIVING, WORKING HERE,
BEING A PART OF THIS,

41:43.201 --> 41:45.635
THIS BUILDING WOULDN'T BE
WHAT IT IS TODAY.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.537
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S
AMAZING ABOUT JIM BEAM.

41:47.539 --> 41:48.938
I MEAN, YOU SAID IT.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.874
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AT THIS POINT,

41:50.876 --> 41:52.609
AND WE'VE BEEN MAKING BOURBON
FOR LONGER THAN THAT.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.544
AND WE PUT OUR HEART AND SOUL
INTO THAT LIQUID.

41:54.546 --> 41:55.578
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
STEPHANIE.

41:55.580 --> 41:56.746
ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT.

41:56.748 --> 41:57.813
-YEAH. THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:57.815 --> 41:58.948
AND I'M EXHAUSTED
ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.350
I NEED TO GO HAVE
A DRINK OF JIM BEAM

42:00.352 --> 42:02.886
'CAUSE I NEED IT
AT THIS POINT.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.722
Nick: IT FEELS SO GOOD
TO ACTUALLY CAPTURE EVIDENCE

42:05.724 --> 42:07.556
AND REALLY VALIDATE THE CLAIMS

42:07.558 --> 42:10.893
THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT
AT THE JIM BEAM DISTILLERY.

42:10.895 --> 42:12.829
Katrina:
PEOPLE LIKE BECKY COME HERE,

42:12.831 --> 42:15.832
AND THEY FEEL LIKE
THEY CAN'T TELL ANYBODY

42:15.834 --> 42:18.902
OUT OF FEAR OF RIDICULE.

42:18.904 --> 42:23.639
AND IT'S SO NICE THAT WE'RE THE
FIRST INVESTIGATORS TO COME HERE

42:23.641 --> 42:25.841
AND BE ABLE TO SAY,
"LOOK, YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

42:25.843 --> 42:27.876
WE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCES,

42:27.878 --> 42:31.080
AND THERE IS SOMETHING
HERE AT JIM BEAM."
