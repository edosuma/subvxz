WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.616
ELIZABETH: Good night, Frank.
- HENRY: Good night, Frank.

00:03.617 --> 00:04.551
Thank you.

00:04.552 --> 00:07.453
(YAWNS) Ow...

00:07.454 --> 00:09.589
- Sorry, okay...
- God, my feet hurt.

00:09.590 --> 00:11.558
I can only do this because I stopped

00:11.559 --> 00:13.393
matching the Panamanian
foreign minister

00:13.394 --> 00:14.394
drink for drink.

00:14.395 --> 00:17.047
Oh, I know. I heard you guys

00:17.048 --> 00:20.184
laughing and clinking glasses.

00:20.185 --> 00:21.619
Yeah, he's... Turns out,

00:21.620 --> 00:23.154
he's former military, used to teach

00:23.155 --> 00:25.055
foreign relations.

00:25.056 --> 00:27.124
And I asked him to speak

00:27.125 --> 00:29.760
at the ethics symposium
next month at the War College.

00:29.761 --> 00:31.962
He said yes, so, yeah,
I'll drink to that.

00:31.963 --> 00:34.965
I don't know how you manage
to have fun at these things.

00:34.966 --> 00:37.434
Well, babe, I don't have
the burden of the job.

00:37.435 --> 00:38.569
Let's face it, I'm a guy
that can have fun

00:38.570 --> 00:40.070
doing pretty much anything.

00:40.071 --> 00:43.107
I know, I used to love that about you.

00:43.108 --> 00:45.776
Oh, God, Henry.

00:45.777 --> 00:48.379
I'm not fun anymore.

00:48.380 --> 00:50.247
You're still fun. Here, give...

00:50.248 --> 00:53.817
(SIGHS) You know what the problem is?

00:53.818 --> 00:55.052
- Huh?
- We don't...

00:55.053 --> 00:57.454
we never see our friends anymore.

00:57.455 --> 00:59.990
I mean, what happened to our friends?

00:59.991 --> 01:01.926
Where are the Rasmussens?
We've been friends with them

01:01.927 --> 01:05.196
since... since Melissa and Stevie were

01:05.197 --> 01:06.430
in preschool together.

01:06.431 --> 01:07.998
When was the last time we saw them?

01:07.999 --> 01:09.800
- I don't remember.
- See?

01:09.801 --> 01:12.736
And we used to have a regular
Cranium night with them.

01:12.737 --> 01:14.738
You used to make people
cry at Cranium.

01:14.739 --> 01:16.807
Look, it's not my fault that
I can still spell backwards

01:16.808 --> 01:18.042
after two drinks.

01:18.043 --> 01:20.611
Wait a minute, didn't Dolly
just have a birthday?

01:20.612 --> 01:23.447
We were always invited to that party.

01:23.448 --> 01:25.798
(SIGHS) I think we
dropped off their list.

01:25.799 --> 01:26.550
What?

01:26.551 --> 01:28.252
- Why?
- We canceled on 'em a bunch.

01:28.253 --> 01:30.554
Oh, so? That happens.
Like eight times.

01:30.555 --> 01:32.323
- Eight times?
- Or nine.

01:32.324 --> 01:34.825
Nine... Wow.

01:34.826 --> 01:35.926
That is bad.

01:35.927 --> 01:37.628
Well, I'll fix it.

01:37.629 --> 01:38.929
I'll write 'em an e-mail,

01:38.930 --> 01:41.832
and I'll try to set
something up for next weekend.

01:41.833 --> 01:42.866
And we won't cancel.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.269
- No matter what.
- No matter what.

01:45.270 --> 01:46.870
And then I can be fun again.

01:46.871 --> 01:48.305
Absolutely.

01:48.306 --> 01:50.608
- You said I was still fun.
- (GROANS)

01:50.609 --> 01:53.477
Former pilot... should have
seen that propeller coming.

01:53.478 --> 01:55.713
- I'm kidding.
- (MAKES CHOKING SOUND)

01:55.714 --> 01:58.282
See, I'm-I'm fun already.

01:58.283 --> 02:00.317
Yeah, you are. Okay, do my feet.

02:00.318 --> 02:01.552
They're big.

02:01.553 --> 02:02.686
DAISY: <i>Jay.</i>

02:02.687 --> 02:04.188
Hey, what's up?

02:04.189 --> 02:06.223
You read the latest polls
coming out of Honduras?

02:06.224 --> 02:07.691
Yeah, bad guy's gaining ground.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.592
- So?
- So what?

02:09.594 --> 02:11.395
So, how you gonna tell M-Sec?

02:11.396 --> 02:12.863
I'll just tell her.

02:12.864 --> 02:14.598
Look, we're convening a conference

02:14.599 --> 02:16.473
on regional security in
Central America today.

02:16.474 --> 02:17.697
Right.

02:17.698 --> 02:19.970
The United States very much
needs this deal as a lynchpin

02:19.971 --> 02:21.071
for our border security.

02:21.072 --> 02:22.406
And having Honduras on board is vital.

02:22.407 --> 02:26.176
Yeah. And President Tejeda is
only two points ahead

02:26.177 --> 02:27.811
of her rival, Maynor Fonseca,
who's threatening

02:27.812 --> 02:29.580
to pull out of the agreement
if he's elected.

02:29.581 --> 02:31.615
Okay, so President Tejeda is
going to be at that conference...

02:31.616 --> 02:34.418
again, today... freaking out
about these same crappy polls

02:34.419 --> 02:35.753
and trying to figure out
what to do about them.

02:35.754 --> 02:37.988
Maybe boost her standing by appearing

02:37.989 --> 02:39.290
to stand up to the U.S.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.025
Yeah, by threatening to pull out
of the security deal,

02:41.026 --> 02:42.192
as one example.

02:42.193 --> 02:44.028
- Okay.
- So, when Nadine

02:44.029 --> 02:46.297
had to give M-Sec bad news
first thing in the morning...

02:46.298 --> 02:48.632
She also pitched her a fix.

02:48.633 --> 02:51.235
So, do you have one?

02:51.236 --> 02:53.370
And then the conference will
culminate in a signing ceremony

02:53.371 --> 02:55.005
with POTUS and the other
heads of state,

02:55.006 --> 02:57.374
but you'll officially open
with some remarks

02:57.375 --> 02:59.376
that Matt is putting
the finishing touches on.

02:59.377 --> 03:00.511
Do you want to give us an overview?

03:00.512 --> 03:01.779
Uh, yeah, sure.

03:01.780 --> 03:04.648
Um, so the big idea is
that, even though

03:04.649 --> 03:07.751
the countries of Central America
and the U.S. are very different,

03:07.752 --> 03:11.355
we all have one common enemy... gangs.

03:11.356 --> 03:12.856
Drug trafficking, violence,

03:12.857 --> 03:15.125
social and economic problems
in Central America

03:15.126 --> 03:16.894
create untenable living conditions

03:16.895 --> 03:18.162
- for their good citizens.
- Thanks.

03:18.163 --> 03:20.631
Which causes said good citizens

03:20.632 --> 03:21.965
to flee from the gangs

03:21.966 --> 03:24.134
and seek refuge in the U.S.

03:24.135 --> 03:26.036
Now, this agreement facilitates

03:26.037 --> 03:27.271
intelligence sharing,

03:27.272 --> 03:29.273
raises law enforcement standards,

03:29.274 --> 03:31.241
and suggests social reforms

03:31.242 --> 03:32.343
that will help alleviate
these problems.

03:32.344 --> 03:34.011
DAISY: So, helping
to solve the gang problem

03:34.012 --> 03:35.112
in Central America

03:35.113 --> 03:36.980
is in America's best interest, too.

03:36.981 --> 03:39.216
In short, we're all
in this together... go, team.

03:39.217 --> 03:40.951
Sounds good. Have you all seen

03:40.952 --> 03:43.253
the latest polling out of Honduras?

03:43.254 --> 03:45.055
We have, indeed, ma'am.

03:45.056 --> 03:46.924
President Tejeda is only up by two.

03:46.925 --> 03:48.726
Over an ex soccer player

03:48.727 --> 03:50.794
who hates America.

03:50.795 --> 03:53.297
Hey, there is so much more
to Maynor Fonseca than that.

03:53.298 --> 03:54.832
He's also semi-literate.

03:54.833 --> 03:56.367
JAY: And proud of it. He and his party

03:56.368 --> 03:59.103
portray President Tejeda
as a weak woman

03:59.104 --> 04:02.873
who's soft on crime and needs
Mean Daddy U.S. to prop her up.

04:02.874 --> 04:04.408
ELIZABETH: Look,
I've known her a while,

04:04.409 --> 04:06.543
and I admire her.

04:06.544 --> 04:09.646
My concern is that in order to combat

04:09.647 --> 04:12.583
Fonseca's accusations
that she's a U.S. puppet,

04:12.584 --> 04:13.917
she walks away from the agreement.

04:13.918 --> 04:16.620
So, what do we do about that?

04:16.620 --> 04:18.755
How about a pull-aside
with her at the conference?

04:18.757 --> 04:20.190
Encourage her to stay the course,

04:20.190 --> 04:22.793
and let her know that,
short of putting our thumb

04:22.794 --> 04:24.795
on the scale of the election,
the U.S. has her back.

04:24.796 --> 04:27.931
Set it up. Yeah. Thanks, everybody.

04:27.932 --> 04:30.634
You may be a little
faster than Nadine.

04:30.635 --> 04:34.104
Thanks for the heads up.

04:34.105 --> 04:36.740
PANAMANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER:
<i>I so enjoyed meeting</i>

04:36.741 --> 04:38.142
your husband, Madam Secretary.

04:38.143 --> 04:40.778
I appreciate his invitation
to visit the War College.

04:40.779 --> 04:42.980
He feels that you'll be
the perfect speaker

04:42.981 --> 04:44.448
for the symposium.

04:44.449 --> 04:47.050
If you'll excuse me a moment.

04:47.051 --> 04:48.218
Am I wrong, or does
President Tejeda look

04:48.219 --> 04:50.721
a lot more serious
than she did yesterday?

04:50.722 --> 04:53.490
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

04:53.491 --> 04:55.159
Mr. Mahoney, your mother called again.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.561
She said to tell you that
she's not afraid to stop by.

04:57.562 --> 04:59.563
So subtle, like a torpedo.

04:59.564 --> 05:01.465
- Thanks, Maggie.
- Hi.

05:01.466 --> 05:03.667
- Hey, what was that about?
- Nothing good.

05:03.668 --> 05:06.437
- Oh, no. Family emergency?
- Yeah.

05:06.438 --> 05:08.972
I'm, uh, almost 35 and still single.

05:08.973 --> 05:10.174
(SCOFFS) You're not single.

05:10.175 --> 05:11.975
You and Captain Baker have...
Are over.

05:11.976 --> 05:13.277
What, you broke up with Ronnie?

05:13.278 --> 05:15.012
Look, I'm really trying
not to think about it.

05:15.013 --> 05:16.914
It's painful. I'm sure you understand.

05:16.915 --> 05:19.550
- But why?
- Thank you for understanding.

05:19.551 --> 05:20.951
I'm sorry, Matt.

05:20.952 --> 05:22.519
Look, she's...

05:22.520 --> 05:25.289
she's going to South Korea for a year,

05:25.290 --> 05:28.091
and after that she can be
assigned someplace like Qatar.

05:28.092 --> 05:29.526
It's the nature of the job.

05:29.527 --> 05:32.129
It's not conducive to
a long-term relationship.

05:32.130 --> 05:35.232
So, we decided
to rip the Band-Aid off.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.301
And whose idea was
the Band-Aid ripping?

05:37.302 --> 05:38.735
I know you think I'm a dreamer,

05:38.736 --> 05:40.471
- but I'm a pragmatist.
- No.

05:40.472 --> 05:42.473
- I think you're an idiot.
- Wait, she was crazy about you.

05:42.474 --> 05:43.540
You really couldn't make it work?

05:43.541 --> 05:45.474
Yeah, I never really considered that.

05:48.145 --> 05:49.580
Dude, I agonized over this.

05:49.581 --> 05:51.515
This was one of the hardest
decisions of my life.

05:51.516 --> 05:55.252
Just... I believe that we both
deserve to be with someone

05:55.253 --> 05:57.254
who we can actually be with.

05:57.255 --> 05:59.957
Now that I'm single again,
my mom's on the job.

05:59.958 --> 06:01.758
As in arranging a marriage?

06:01.759 --> 06:04.428
BLAKE: Well,

06:04.429 --> 06:05.696
no offense,
she can't possibly do worse

06:05.697 --> 06:06.663
than you're already doing.

06:06.664 --> 06:08.499
He has a point. And who loves you

06:08.500 --> 06:09.533
and knows you better than anyone?

06:09.534 --> 06:10.834
And isn't an app on your phone?

06:10.835 --> 06:12.302
You know, there's a
really decent chance

06:12.303 --> 06:14.137
that your mother knows what
you need more than you do.

06:14.138 --> 06:15.172
There's a decent chance that anyone

06:15.173 --> 06:16.240
knows what you need more than you do.

06:16.241 --> 06:17.608
Dude, I know you're a fan of Ronnie.

06:17.609 --> 06:19.543
- So am I. She's amazing.
- No, no, I just...

06:19.544 --> 06:21.845
But long-distance
relationships do not work.

06:21.846 --> 06:23.113
Everybody knows that.

06:23.114 --> 06:26.683
Okay, so, give the fix-up a shot.

06:26.684 --> 06:28.485
- Call your mom.
- (SIGHS)

06:28.486 --> 06:29.520
Hey.

06:29.521 --> 06:31.088
Outgoing President Tejeda.

06:31.089 --> 06:32.723
DAISY: So, M-Sec and Tejeda:

06:32.724 --> 06:34.591
friendly chat or tank the agreement?

06:34.592 --> 06:35.726
Cross your fingers.

06:35.727 --> 06:38.228
Jay, thanks.

06:38.229 --> 06:40.264
Daphne, I just wanted to tell you that

06:40.265 --> 06:43.901
I'm aware of the pressure that
you are getting back home,

06:43.902 --> 06:46.069
and, as your friend, I sympathize.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.671
So, have you seen the latest polls?

06:47.672 --> 06:50.240
Yeah, I have, and I'm sorry.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.309
But it's also why I have to ask

06:52.310 --> 06:54.545
about your commitment
to this agreement.

06:54.546 --> 06:56.547
- I believe in the agreement.
- Good.

06:56.548 --> 06:57.981
But you have to give me something.

06:57.982 --> 07:00.584
Something that I can
point out with pride

07:00.585 --> 07:04.087
that I was able to get
from the mighty U.S.

07:04.088 --> 07:05.989
What, exactly, are you asking for?

07:05.990 --> 07:08.091
I want the aid money
that's been allocated

07:08.092 --> 07:10.627
for this security
agreement fast-tracked,

07:10.628 --> 07:13.363
so we can receive it as soon
as the agreement is signed.

07:13.364 --> 07:15.432
Meaning today?

07:15.433 --> 07:17.034
That money can only be released

07:17.035 --> 07:18.936
after certain benchmarks
have been met.

07:18.937 --> 07:21.805
You know the terms.
You helped draft them.

07:21.806 --> 07:23.407
What do you think that
soccer hooligan Fonseca

07:23.408 --> 07:24.908
is going to do with your benchmarks

07:24.909 --> 07:27.644
if he gets elected?

07:27.645 --> 07:29.146
Getting you that aid money early

07:29.147 --> 07:30.781
will earn you votes.

07:30.782 --> 07:34.585
You are asking us to help tip
the election in your favor.

07:34.586 --> 07:36.620
And I am telling you
that President Dalton

07:36.621 --> 07:37.788
would never do that.

07:37.789 --> 07:40.657
So, now the U.S. is timid about

07:40.658 --> 07:42.359
meddling in our affairs?

07:42.360 --> 07:45.495
Por favor.

07:45.496 --> 07:48.665
How many elections
has the U.S. subverted

07:48.666 --> 07:50.767
in Latin America?

07:50.768 --> 07:52.302
How many coups and dictatorships

07:52.303 --> 07:54.237
have you backed?

07:54.238 --> 07:56.907
Indeed, how many times

07:56.908 --> 07:59.042
have you intervened in Honduras?

07:59.043 --> 08:00.711
At least seven, I believe.

08:00.712 --> 08:03.313
Correct. And why?

08:03.314 --> 08:05.482
Because when it comes to Honduras,

08:05.483 --> 08:08.352
the U.S. has always done
what it views as

08:08.353 --> 08:11.187
its own interest.

President Tejeda,
I'm sorry that this crisis

10:20.681 --> 10:22.280
has shortened the celebration for this

10:22.281 --> 10:23.848
groundbreaking security agreement.

10:23.849 --> 10:25.807
It is very unfortunate.

10:25.808 --> 10:27.776
Particularly in these

10:27.777 --> 10:29.845
few days before the election.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.647
Nevertheless, I must leave immediately

10:32.648 --> 10:34.049
and deal with the situation.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.417
We would be more than happy

10:35.418 --> 10:37.252
to offer you the help of the FBI

10:37.253 --> 10:39.888
to locate the hostages
and aid in their rescue.

10:39.889 --> 10:42.491
But your aid would only give
my opponent more ammunition.

10:42.492 --> 10:46.828
Isn't our main goal here
to get the hostages freed?

10:46.829 --> 10:48.897
Surely, Fonseca couldn't
shame you for that.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.433
I assure you he would.

10:51.434 --> 10:54.736
If Secretary McCord was
correct in estimating that

10:54.737 --> 10:57.572
the release of our aid
package ahead of schedule

10:57.573 --> 10:59.007
could tip the election my way,

10:59.008 --> 11:04.613
sending the FBI would
unfairly help Fonseca.

11:04.614 --> 11:06.815
And I don't think any of us want that.

11:06.816 --> 11:08.884
Of course, Madam President.

11:08.885 --> 11:11.920
We'll, uh, have a team standing by

can handle the situation

11:15.858 --> 11:17.893

your citizen very soon.

Well, that was frosty.

release their aid package early.

11:35.645 --> 11:37.045
Oh, you think?

11:37.046 --> 11:40.682
Well, it's up to the two
candidates to duke it out,

11:40.683 --> 11:44.653

or in this case, woman... loses.

11:45.788 --> 11:47.455
but Honduras is still
the murder capital

11:47.456 --> 11:48.790

11:48.791 --> 11:51.393
If we leave this in the hands
of their security forces,

11:51.394 --> 11:54.229
there's a good chance
that American aid worker

11:54.230 --> 11:55.697

11:55.698 --> 11:58.833
A small FBI team working a covert op

might be a prudent backup plan, sir.

12:20.856 --> 12:22.057
Probably 'cause he, you know,

12:22.058 --> 12:23.658
put off studying till the last minute.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.760
I wonder who they think is gonna
do all this running around

12:25.761 --> 12:26.995
after them when they get to college.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.396
Well, you know, eventually,

12:28.397 --> 12:29.831
they'll lose something important
and get in trouble.

just pick a date and

We are so glad to have you help

13:15.711 --> 13:17.946
Yeah, I told Olivia not to go.

13:17.947 --> 13:19.714
There's a reason
my family left Honduras.

13:19.715 --> 13:20.849
But she wouldn't listen.

13:20.850 --> 13:22.884
She wants to change the world.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.086
What would we do
without people like Olivia?

13:25.087 --> 13:27.055
Please, please.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.157
Well, first of all,
I speak for the secretary

13:29.158 --> 13:31.826
when I say how sorry we are
for what's happened.

13:31.827 --> 13:33.728
People who do the important work
like your daughter

13:33.729 --> 13:34.963
face challenges

13:34.964 --> 13:38.500
and dangers that... well,
they aren't for everyone,

13:38.501 --> 13:39.934
and we need more like her.

13:39.935 --> 13:42.037
How long does it typically take

13:42.038 --> 13:44.005
for the State Department
to pay the ransom?

13:44.006 --> 13:46.274
Well, the thing is, the United States

13:46.275 --> 13:48.643
doesn't do that, Mrs. Pedilla.

13:48.644 --> 13:50.445
We have a strict policy
of never paying for hostages.

13:50.446 --> 13:53.548
That's the policy
for terrorist groups.

13:53.549 --> 13:55.083
- But this is a gang.
- I'm sorry,

13:55.084 --> 13:56.751
but the policy is the same.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.952
There's no money for hostages.

13:57.953 --> 13:59.020
Wha...

13:59.021 --> 14:00.588
But let me assure you

14:00.589 --> 14:02.357
that your daughter's whereabouts
and ultimate release

14:02.358 --> 14:06.227
are receiving the full focus
of our embassy in Tegucigalpa,

14:06.228 --> 14:08.430
as well as that
of the whole department

14:08.431 --> 14:10.498
and other agencies.

14:10.499 --> 14:11.666
We are exploring

14:11.667 --> 14:13.768
every option available to us.

14:13.769 --> 14:16.271
Except the one
that will get her released.

14:16.272 --> 14:20.174
I'm... I'm very sorry.

14:22.243 --> 14:23.677
Listen...

14:48.203 --> 14:50.472
Mr. Whitman, we appreciate
your fine sentiments

14:50.473 --> 14:51.906
and your fine Spanish, too,

14:51.907 --> 14:54.175
but words don't matter to
the thugs who have our daughter.

14:54.176 --> 14:55.710
Only money does.

14:55.711 --> 14:56.978
And if you can't spare that,

14:56.979 --> 15:00.915
then words are all you're offering.

15:00.916 --> 15:03.017

15:19.634 --> 15:22.103

15:22.104 --> 15:26.808
Mrs. Pedilla left in tears.

15:26.809 --> 15:29.878
I tried to connect with them, but...

15:29.879 --> 15:32.180
I wound up making it all about me.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.481
I completely failed.

15:33.482 --> 15:34.883

15:39.522 --> 15:43.291
in one of the most dangerous
places on Earth.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.560
We may not be able to save her.

15:45.561 --> 15:49.330
You think there's a good way
to tell her parents that?

15:49.331 --> 15:51.832
I don't know.

15:53.334 --> 15:56.805
Look, Jay, you have been
around here long enough

15:56.806 --> 15:59.507
to know that this job is just one

15:59.508 --> 16:02.377
impossible situation after another.

16:02.378 --> 16:07.448
Sometimes we can't fix it;
all we can do is take it.

16:07.449 --> 16:09.217
I can take it, ma'am.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.653
I know you can.

16:11.654 --> 16:13.555
That's why I hired you.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.490
So go take a walk and clear your head.

16:15.491 --> 16:18.793

throw the towel in on this,

16:18.794 --> 16:20.562
- and I need your help, okay?
- Will do.

16:36.312 --> 16:37.745
I've got good news and bad news.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.215
Um, and I'm gonna tell you
the bad news first.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.950
So I don't want you to freak out.

16:41.951 --> 16:43.218
Okay?

16:43.219 --> 16:44.786
That never helps.

16:44.787 --> 16:47.455
I got a curt e-mail
from the Rasmussens

16:47.456 --> 16:50.391
saying that they're "booked solid"

16:50.392 --> 16:51.492
for the next several months.

16:51.493 --> 16:53.194
And they send the best
to you and the kids,

16:53.195 --> 16:56.397
and they wish us well.

16:56.398 --> 16:57.864
Wow.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.738
Well, did you grovel sufficiently?

17:03.739 --> 17:06.741
Well, I apologized
for our cancellations.

17:06.742 --> 17:08.242
I took all the blame.

17:08.243 --> 17:12.347
I said we missed them and we
were turning over a new leaf.

17:12.348 --> 17:16.017
But, babe, I think the
Rasmussens have moved on.

17:16.018 --> 17:17.518
Moved on?

17:17.519 --> 17:20.088
That's crazy.

17:20.089 --> 17:22.991
Moved on. They're on our bookshelf.

17:22.992 --> 17:26.027
Do you know how many
non-relative people

17:26.028 --> 17:29.097
have made it to our photo
collection on the bookshelf?

17:29.098 --> 17:30.632
Exactly two.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.734
The Rasmussens.

17:32.735 --> 17:36.404
Oh, Henry, we are terrible friends.

17:36.405 --> 17:39.307
We-we just dropped the ball a little.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.575
And, plus, they're really judgy.

17:40.576 --> 17:42.810
- It's like eight strikes, and you're out.
- Yeah.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.279
Who does that?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.680
The good news is that

17:45.681 --> 17:48.116
we have a second chance with
another couple, the Boroumands.

17:48.117 --> 17:50.418
- Piper's parents?
- Yeah.

17:50.419 --> 17:52.120
We're having dinner with them
tomorrow night.

17:52.121 --> 17:55.290
Oh. Not a weekend.

17:55.291 --> 17:57.692
It's our first date.
We got to work up to it.

17:57.693 --> 17:59.993
Yeah, I guess.

18:01.296 --> 18:05.033
Well, okay, this is good. Yeah.

18:05.034 --> 18:06.267
They're interesting people.

18:06.268 --> 18:10.071
They're aid workers,
lived all over the world.

18:10.072 --> 18:13.708
We got that in common,
and our-our kids.

18:13.709 --> 18:16.844
Yeah, I am digging this relationship.

18:16.845 --> 18:20.315
In fact, you know what,
who are the Rasmussens?

18:20.316 --> 18:21.950
No, no. No way. No possible way.

Out of everybody in D.C.,

18:29.591 --> 18:30.925
you guys can't hang out
with Piper's parents.

18:30.926 --> 18:33.061

18:33.062 --> 18:35.296
that you're not gonna talk about us.

18:51.613 --> 18:54.515
unleashed a violent crackdown
on local gangs.

18:54.516 --> 18:57.352
Word is, the crackdown was
spurred by the kidnapping

18:57.353 --> 19:00.488
of 15 aid workers,
including one American.

19:00.489 --> 19:02.623
A spokesperson for President Tejeda

19:02.624 --> 19:04.859
says the president
is enacting a widespread

19:04.860 --> 19:06.527
search-and-detain operation

19:06.528 --> 19:09.664
that will not end until
all the hostages are freed

19:09.665 --> 19:11.332
and their captors caught and executed.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.469
Caught and executed?

19:14.470 --> 19:17.805
What happened to tried
in a court of law?

19:17.806 --> 19:22.221
Well, maybe it's just hyperbole
to put pressure on the FT-88.

19:22.222 --> 19:26.293
But if she pushes too hard, she
could get those hostages killed.

19:33.054 --> 19:35.223
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Oh, hey.

19:35.224 --> 19:38.459
I was kind of hoping maybe
you'd be Blake with a pastry.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.128
No offense.

19:40.129 --> 19:41.829
So, what's up?

19:41.830 --> 19:45.766
Uh, there's some interesting
news on the hostage situation.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.069
It turns out that
Olivia Pedilla's father

19:48.070 --> 19:51.177
manages a warehouse facility
for Shelton Anderson.

19:51.178 --> 19:52.979
The Shelton Anderson?

19:52.980 --> 19:54.414
The very one.

19:54.415 --> 19:56.416
He's willing to pay
the ransom personally

19:56.417 --> 19:58.184
to get the hostages released.

19:58.185 --> 20:00.420
Wow, it must be nice
to be a billionaire.

20:00.421 --> 20:03.990
Well, I'm gonna have
to talk to the FBI.

20:03.991 --> 20:06.226
But potentially good news, huh?

20:06.227 --> 20:08.728
Uh, yeah.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.564
If the gang will hold up
their end of the bargain.

20:11.565 --> 20:13.366
Which they don't always do.

20:13.367 --> 20:14.667
You'll have to do your best

20:14.668 --> 20:17.537
to manage the Pedillas' expectations.

20:17.538 --> 20:19.339
And your own.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.907
Will do.

20:25.645 --> 20:27.180
We just received
this surveillance video

20:27.181 --> 20:30.650
from our team,
who got it from a gas station

20:30.651 --> 20:32.919
in the Parque La Leona area
of Tegucigalpa.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.555
Oddly, the vans then traveled north.

20:35.556 --> 20:39.659
In the opposite direction
of FT-88 territory.

20:39.660 --> 20:41.628
Well, could it be some kind
of a head fake?

20:41.629 --> 20:43.563
Maybe. We're expanding our search.

20:43.564 --> 20:45.598
You know, FT-88 made a statement

20:45.599 --> 20:47.834
claiming they had nothing
to do with the kidnapping.

20:47.835 --> 20:50.336
They're saying it must
be some other gang.

20:50.337 --> 20:51.805
It's their way of reducing culpability

20:51.806 --> 20:54.707
in case one of the hostages
is killed accidentally.

20:54.708 --> 20:56.409
Anyway, the reason I stopped by...

20:56.410 --> 20:58.711
Shelton Anderson,

20:58.712 --> 21:03.216
he's willing to pay the
ransom demand personally.

21:03.217 --> 21:06.152
- Can he...?
- He's free to do that.

21:06.153 --> 21:09.022
Recent legislation has made it
possible for private individuals

21:09.023 --> 21:12.025
to pay a ransom without fear
of breaking the law.

21:12.026 --> 21:14.260
We're happy to facilitate,
let's just hope...

21:14.261 --> 21:17.397
Has anyone looked at
ISR satellite photos

21:17.398 --> 21:18.665
of Northern Honduras?

21:18.666 --> 21:19.899
Most of it is government land.

21:19.900 --> 21:21.000
So why are the bad guys

21:21.001 --> 21:24.070
heading straight for the good guys?

21:24.071 --> 21:25.438
I'll check it out.

21:25.439 --> 21:28.240
Thanks, Marguerite.
Thanks for your time.

21:30.276 --> 21:31.244
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:31.245 --> 21:33.679
- Oh, I-I...
- Sure thing.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.350
I am so sorry.

21:37.351 --> 21:39.886
HENRY: Come on, babe. I really,
really wanted to be on time,

21:39.887 --> 21:41.588
at least for our first date.

21:41.589 --> 21:42.655
Don't give it a second thought.

21:42.656 --> 21:44.023
- (SIGHS): Oh, gosh.
- I'm Frank.

21:44.024 --> 21:45.425
- Frank.
- Hi, Elizabeth.

21:45.426 --> 21:46.993
I'm Regina. I'm so glad
that we're getting together.

21:46.994 --> 21:48.094
ELIZABETH: Us, too.

21:48.095 --> 21:51.364
- Really.
- Oh, babe.

21:51.365 --> 21:52.932
Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't.

21:52.933 --> 21:56.035
Oh, my phone! I, I left my phone.

21:56.036 --> 21:58.004
- (LAUGHS)
- That's so...

21:58.005 --> 22:00.874
Matt, thank you. This is Frank.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.810
And Matt is my DS agent,

22:03.811 --> 22:06.813
- and that's so kind of you. I'm so...
- Have a good dinner, ma'am.

22:06.814 --> 22:08.948
Thank you. I never leave my phone.

22:08.949 --> 22:10.917
I can't believe it.
That's so embarrassing.

22:10.918 --> 22:13.052
Normally, those guys just wait.

22:13.053 --> 22:15.388
How funny, you never even know
that they're there, and then...

22:15.389 --> 22:16.922
Thank you, that'd be perfect.

22:18.825 --> 22:21.094
We just love Piper, by the way.

22:21.095 --> 22:22.762
What a doll. She's...

22:22.763 --> 22:27.000
enlightened Jason
to gender politics, which is...

22:27.001 --> 22:28.134
- Yeah.
- I'm just relieved

22:28.135 --> 22:30.069
she has someone else to lecture.

22:30.070 --> 22:32.705
It's so adorable.
I mean, Piper is so type A

22:32.706 --> 22:34.040
and Jason is so laid-back.

22:34.041 --> 22:36.809
- Our Jason? Laid-back?
- Wow. Well...

22:36.810 --> 22:41.147
- I have so many stories to dispute that...
- (LAUGHS)

22:41.148 --> 22:42.982
...but I've been sworn to silence

22:42.983 --> 22:46.419
by our laid-back son. Wow.

22:46.420 --> 22:48.087
We've been threatened, too,

22:48.088 --> 22:50.789
so maybe we should
just change the subjects.

22:52.792 --> 22:56.029
I just have to ask you about
the hostage crisis in Honduras.

22:56.030 --> 22:58.164
Those poor people and their families.

22:58.165 --> 23:00.934
Yeah. It's-it's very scary,

23:00.935 --> 23:02.201
but we're working very hard

23:02.202 --> 23:04.604
to resolve it quickly and peacefully.

23:04.605 --> 23:07.073
Elizabeth is at dinner, Regina.

23:07.074 --> 23:08.575
- She doesn't want to talk shop.
- Oh...

23:08.576 --> 23:09.876
No, no, no, no.

23:09.877 --> 23:13.046
It's just there isn't much
to talk about at this point.

23:13.047 --> 23:16.115
That's all. Really.

23:16.116 --> 23:20.674
Anyway, just so you
know, we have dined

23:20.675 --> 23:22.872
with high-ranking
government officials before.

23:22.873 --> 23:25.475
Oh, you so don't need
to tell that story.

23:25.476 --> 23:28.852
No. It's good. So, uh,
we were in Burkina Faso.

23:28.853 --> 23:29.946
Oh.

23:29.947 --> 23:31.714
And, uh, the foreign minister

23:31.715 --> 23:34.417
suggested that we
come over to his house

23:34.418 --> 23:37.086
and try fermented locust beans.

23:37.087 --> 23:39.122
And I said "In!"

23:39.123 --> 23:41.224
- Oh, no.
- Exactly.

23:41.225 --> 23:43.560
(CLEARS THROAT) Those beans
were not Frank's friend.

23:43.561 --> 23:46.396
Eh, but the toilet in
the guest bathroom was.

23:46.397 --> 23:48.131
(LAUGHTER) For three hours.

23:48.132 --> 23:50.967
In-in some cultures,
that's considered a compliment,

23:50.968 --> 23:52.602
like, burping after the meal.

23:52.603 --> 23:54.270
- You're making that up.
- She so is.

23:54.271 --> 23:56.204
(LAUGHTER) You never know.

24:02.111 --> 24:04.414
Afia?

24:04.415 --> 24:05.915
You made it.

24:05.916 --> 24:08.551
Why? Did my mother say
I was unreliable?

24:08.552 --> 24:09.686
Because I'm not.

24:09.687 --> 24:11.754
It's just that sometimes
I'm late to meet her

24:11.755 --> 24:13.890
because it's not somewhere
I really want to go.

24:13.891 --> 24:16.159
- Which is not the case here.
- Uh, no, it's okay.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.228
I heard about the kidnapping
in Honduras on the news

24:18.229 --> 24:19.896
and I thought you might have to work.

24:19.897 --> 24:22.332
No, I-I'm a speechwriter,
so I'm sort of

24:22.333 --> 24:25.435
the caboose in any crisis.
Clean-up detail.

24:25.436 --> 24:27.903
But in a way that's vital and sexy.

24:31.241 --> 24:32.575
(SIGHS)

24:32.576 --> 24:35.912
So, you want to talk
about how awkward this is?

24:35.913 --> 24:37.447
Is this your first time?

24:37.448 --> 24:40.516
I can honestly say I've never
had a woman ask me that before.

24:40.517 --> 24:41.651
But yes.

24:41.652 --> 24:45.054
So I'm assuming it's not yours.

24:45.055 --> 24:46.456
What happened to the other guys?

24:46.457 --> 24:48.324
Didn't quite work out,

24:48.325 --> 24:50.093
but my mother is running
out of patience.

24:50.094 --> 24:52.295
- Mine, too.
- Oh, I have an idea.

24:52.296 --> 24:54.464
- Yeah?
- Why don't we take a selfie

24:54.465 --> 24:57.100
and send it to our moms so
they don't text us all night

24:57.101 --> 24:59.202
to make sure we found each other?

24:59.203 --> 25:01.870
- So smart. Okay.
- Okay.

25:01.871 --> 25:03.673
Honestly, it probably
won't stop my mom.

25:03.674 --> 25:06.075
(LAUGHS)

25:06.076 --> 25:09.912
- Okay, I am sending this to you.
- Great.

25:09.913 --> 25:11.748
Let me ask you something.
Did you, um...

25:11.749 --> 25:15.518
choose a three-hour doc
on baseball to impress me?

25:15.519 --> 25:19.188
Maybe. Do you like baseball?

25:19.189 --> 25:21.224
Less than sewing.

25:21.225 --> 25:22.725
I don't know anything about it either,

25:22.726 --> 25:24.694
but maybe we could learn something.

25:24.695 --> 25:25.962
Hey, I'm off the clock.

25:25.963 --> 25:28.531
I got two words for you: <i>Iron Man.</i>

25:28.532 --> 25:30.533
I love those words.

25:30.534 --> 25:32.635
Oh, wonderful.

25:32.636 --> 25:34.704
I know driving Piper around
seems like a drag,

25:34.705 --> 25:36.873
but you will miss it, believe me.

25:36.874 --> 25:40.109
I knew so much more about
Jason's life when I was

25:40.110 --> 25:41.878
his full-time chauffeur, it was...

25:41.879 --> 25:43.379
(CHUCKLES) I loved when she

25:43.380 --> 25:45.915
used to sit in the back with
a friend and forget I was there.

25:45.916 --> 25:47.517
That's how you learn everything.

25:47.518 --> 25:50.119
I hate to sound the alarm bell,
but we're talking about them.

25:50.120 --> 25:53.222
I think it was unavoidable.

25:53.223 --> 25:56.125
Oh, hey, do you guys want to try

25:56.126 --> 25:59.595
these crazy delicious macarons

25:59.596 --> 26:01.264
that the French foreign
minister sends me?

26:01.265 --> 26:03.900
- That sounds wonderful.
- Henry, will you give me a hand?

26:03.901 --> 26:05.801
Be right back.

26:07.562 --> 26:10.999
That was too much,
the foreign minister thing?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.300
I think they were charmed.

26:12.301 --> 26:14.736
- Right? It is going well.
- Yeah.

26:14.737 --> 26:17.773
Second location with the Boroumands.

26:17.774 --> 26:19.307
Take that, Rasmussens.

26:19.308 --> 26:21.176
Here, put 'em on a plate.

26:21.177 --> 26:23.578
The box is fine. It's from France.

26:23.579 --> 26:25.212
Yeah, it's folksy.

26:26.581 --> 26:28.784
Here you go.

26:28.785 --> 26:30.051
Wait till you try these.

26:30.052 --> 26:31.419
Oh, um, somebody's phone
was ringing a lot

26:31.420 --> 26:32.721
when you were in the kitchen.
(PHONE VIBRATING)

26:32.722 --> 26:35.824
That's mine. I'll be right back.

26:35.825 --> 26:38.994
These look great.
So I have a question.

26:38.995 --> 26:41.563
Blake, hi.

26:41.564 --> 26:43.865
BLAKE: Sorry to disturb,
but Shelton Anderson is in town

26:43.866 --> 26:45.967
and he wants to meet
with you right away.

26:45.968 --> 26:47.302
Okay, set it up.

26:47.303 --> 26:49.304
First thing tomorrow morning.
I'll come in early, okay?

26:49.305 --> 26:51.173
No, ma'am, he's there now.

26:51.174 --> 26:55.944
There... here? As in,
(WHISPERING): outside my house?

26:55.945 --> 26:57.279
Yes, ma'am.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.614
Hello, entitlement.

26:59.615 --> 27:00.649
Yes, ma'am.

27:00.650 --> 27:04.486
(SIGHS) All right. Thank you.

27:04.487 --> 27:06.721
I shouldn't, but maybe this one.

27:06.722 --> 27:10.592
There's this work thing
that I have to...

27:10.593 --> 27:11.993
This guy is here and I just

27:11.994 --> 27:13.995
need to meet with him
really quickly. I'm...

27:13.996 --> 27:16.798
Oh, don't worry, we have
drinks and French macarons.

27:16.799 --> 27:17.699
We'll be fine.

27:17.700 --> 27:19.167
- No, we should go.
- No.

27:19.168 --> 27:21.303
No, no, no. It'll be
really quick. I just...

27:21.304 --> 27:22.637
Take a minute, it's not, it's not a...

27:22.638 --> 27:24.306
Come on, we'll just take
this stuff in the other room.

27:24.307 --> 27:25.941
This never happens.

27:25.942 --> 27:28.992
It happens all the time,
just so you know.

27:28.993 --> 27:30.101
- (LAUGHS)

27:32.414 --> 27:34.716
- Hi.
- Well, this is a first.

27:34.717 --> 27:36.484
Trying to give someone
millions of dollars,

27:36.485 --> 27:38.086
and they won't take it.

27:38.087 --> 27:41.656
Mr. Anderson, Elizabeth McCord.
Welcome to our home.

27:41.657 --> 27:43.725
Yeah. Yeah, cute place.

27:43.726 --> 27:48.230
We like it. Thank you.
Um... So what happened?

27:48.231 --> 27:49.497
You tried to pay the ransom...

27:49.498 --> 27:52.234
The FBI put me in touch
with some people in Honduras,

27:52.235 --> 27:54.603
and we offered to pay
the ransom money to FT-88,

27:54.604 --> 27:57.539
but they had no way to accept
the money. No routing numbers

27:57.540 --> 28:00.976
for banks. No bitcoin. Nothing.

28:00.977 --> 28:02.844
Hell, they don't even have Venmo.

28:02.845 --> 28:05.380
Well, that is peculiar.

28:05.381 --> 28:06.830
Look, I'm trying to
be the good guy here.

28:06.831 --> 28:08.483
- Yeah...
- But this is insane.

28:08.484 --> 28:11.253
You think you can help me
get to the bottom of this?

28:11.254 --> 28:14.990
- Uh, yes. Absolutely.
- All right. Clock's ticking.

28:14.991 --> 28:17.691
I'll get that.

28:18.994 --> 28:20.695
Guys, I am so sorry,

28:20.696 --> 28:23.732
but I've got to head back
into the office to...

28:23.733 --> 28:26.334
- What happened?
- Well, they had to go.

28:26.335 --> 28:27.602
Out the back door?

28:27.603 --> 28:29.437
Yeah, they didn't want to disturb you.

28:29.438 --> 28:31.673
Well, were they upset?

28:31.674 --> 28:34.242
Not at all. It was just getting late.

28:34.243 --> 28:36.311
They said to say thank you,
they had a wonderful evening,

28:36.312 --> 28:37.646
and we'll do it again sometime.

28:37.647 --> 28:40.682
Sometime. Not soon?

28:40.683 --> 28:42.550
Soon. They definitely said "soon."

28:42.551 --> 28:43.785
Do you have to go to the office?

28:43.786 --> 28:45.854
Yeah, I just...

28:45.855 --> 28:47.555
But that was good. We were fun, right?

28:47.556 --> 28:49.257
We skated a clean program.

28:49.258 --> 28:51.339
We even got a ten from
the Russian judge.

28:51.340 --> 28:52.394
Okay, that's too far.

28:52.395 --> 28:54.496
- Go.
- Right.

28:54.497 --> 28:57.065
ELIZABETH: <i>A ruthless, cut-throat gang</i>

28:57.066 --> 29:00.902
kidnaps a group of aid workers.

29:00.903 --> 29:02.070
Not unusual.

29:02.071 --> 29:04.673
One turns out to be American,
also not unusual.

29:04.674 --> 29:06.508
But then they take off
with the hostages

29:06.509 --> 29:08.677
in the opposite direction
of their own turf.

29:08.678 --> 29:13.148
That is unusual. Also, "turf"?

29:13.149 --> 29:14.816
Isn't that what they call it?

29:14.817 --> 29:16.251
In <i>West Side Story.</i>

29:16.252 --> 29:19.054
Anyway, they demand a ransom,

29:19.055 --> 29:22.724
but then have no way for the
ransom to be delivered to them.

29:22.725 --> 29:24.392
Very unusual.

29:24.393 --> 29:26.428
And if they're not all that eager

29:26.429 --> 29:29.431
to get $30 million,

29:29.432 --> 29:31.499
- it's not about the money.
- Exactly.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.435
Ma'am. Sorry. Marguerite
Sanchez is here to see you.

29:33.436 --> 29:36.304
Yeah, send her in, please.
Marguerite, hey.

29:36.305 --> 29:38.881
- You're here late.
- Yes, Madam Secretary.

29:38.882 --> 29:42.428
You suggested checking
the northern part of Honduras,

29:42.429 --> 29:44.104
where the vans appeared to be headed.

29:44.105 --> 29:45.796
Turns out the hostages are being held

29:45.797 --> 29:47.982
on government land, an operational

29:47.983 --> 29:49.384
military base, no less.

29:49.385 --> 29:51.629
JAY: FT-88 took over a military base?

29:51.630 --> 29:54.065
From the satellite photos it appears

29:54.066 --> 29:55.466
President Tejeda's Secret Service

29:55.467 --> 29:56.768
are in control of the base,

29:56.769 --> 29:57.945
and thus the hostages.

29:57.946 --> 30:00.877
There's no sign of FT-88 at all?

30:00.878 --> 30:02.845
None.

30:02.846 --> 30:06.581
Tejeda kidnapped her own people...

30:08.217 --> 30:12.054
so then she could be the
hero who rescued them.

30:12.055 --> 30:15.858
This whole thing is a setup.

30:15.859 --> 30:18.126
(CHUCKLES)

30:23.735 --> 30:25.656
Well, don't bother denying,
Madam President.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.334
We have satellite photos

30:27.335 --> 30:30.437
of your own Secret Service
guarding the military base

30:30.438 --> 30:33.173
where the hostages are being held.

30:33.174 --> 30:35.809
I believe it was a rogue
group of my officers

30:35.810 --> 30:37.110
acting on their own.

30:37.111 --> 30:39.780
More like a plan you hatched
to look tough on crime

30:39.781 --> 30:42.716
to help you win the election,
but that doesn't matter now.

30:42.717 --> 30:45.385
What matters is that your
forces have those hostages,

30:45.386 --> 30:48.221
including our citizen, Olivia Pedilla.

30:48.222 --> 30:49.623
Maybe it's time
for the Honduran people

30:49.624 --> 30:51.091
to know what desperate
lengths their president

30:51.092 --> 30:52.259
will go to to retain power.

30:52.260 --> 30:55.862
This is all pure speculation,
Mr. President.

30:55.863 --> 30:57.864
But even if it were true,

30:57.865 --> 31:00.467
I believe it would be unwise
to take such an action.

31:00.468 --> 31:01.635
And why is that?

31:01.636 --> 31:03.370
Because you will not just
be putting your thumb

31:03.371 --> 31:05.672
on the scale of the election.

31:05.673 --> 31:08.642
You will be handing the victory
to Maynor Fonseca.

31:08.643 --> 31:12.512
So now tampering with
the election is a bad thing?

31:12.513 --> 31:15.515
Are you the same woman
I met four years ago

31:15.516 --> 31:17.317
who wanted nothing more
than to improve

31:17.318 --> 31:19.519
the lives of the Honduran people?

31:19.520 --> 31:22.589
Your country's history in
Honduras has made it impossible

31:22.590 --> 31:24.324
for anyone's hands to stay clean here.

31:24.325 --> 31:25.425
DALTON: Enough.

31:25.426 --> 31:27.794
This isn't a chance
to justify yourself,

31:27.795 --> 31:29.162
and this isn't a negotiation.

31:29.163 --> 31:32.065
The United States demands
that you release all hostages

31:32.066 --> 31:35.268
immediately, and that
Olivia Pedilla be delivered

31:35.269 --> 31:38.305
to the United States
embassy in Tegucigalpa.

31:38.306 --> 31:40.540
If Olivia doesn't pass
through the embassy gates

31:40.541 --> 31:42.242
within six hours, the consequences

31:42.243 --> 31:44.010
will be swift and dire.

31:44.011 --> 31:46.380
Do you understand?

31:46.381 --> 31:47.547
(SIGHS)

31:47.548 --> 31:50.015
Six hours, Madam President.

31:52.686 --> 31:54.888
Oh, I thought you were
a true fan, okay.

31:54.889 --> 31:56.156
A true fan would've known.

31:56.157 --> 31:58.692
That the new Iron Man
is, what, 12 years old?

31:58.693 --> 32:00.761
- Uh, he just turned 18.
- (CHUCKLES)

32:00.762 --> 32:03.397
I mean, I heard someone
in the theater say that.

32:03.398 --> 32:05.198
See, this, this is
why I hate prequels.

32:05.199 --> 32:07.601
I'm staring at those muscles,

32:07.602 --> 32:10.737
and then I look up at his face
and he looks like a little boy.

32:10.738 --> 32:13.573
So, you're upset that you
weren't sexually attracted

32:13.574 --> 32:16.375
- to baby Iron Man?
- (LAUGHS)

32:18.345 --> 32:20.981
- Oh, no.
- What?

32:20.982 --> 32:24.384
Just, um, a guy that I used to date...

32:24.385 --> 32:25.685
for a long time.

32:25.686 --> 32:27.020
So an ex-boyfriend?

32:27.021 --> 32:30.924
Oh, that cannot be a guy

32:30.925 --> 32:33.960
your mom set you up with.

32:33.961 --> 32:35.896
Hey, how afraid should I be?

32:35.897 --> 32:37.798
I have no idea why he's here.

32:37.799 --> 32:40.834
Okay, great.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.836
- I'm Ryan.
- Okay.

32:42.837 --> 32:45.472
I'm Afia's ex-fiancé.

32:45.473 --> 32:47.307
You have to be kidding.
We were never engaged.

32:47.308 --> 32:49.342
- You wouldn't even say the word.
- We talked about marriage.

32:49.343 --> 32:51.111
I talked about marriage.

32:51.112 --> 32:52.813
You kept saying how we didn't need

32:52.814 --> 32:54.247
to label and define everything.

32:54.248 --> 32:55.482
You hid me from your family

32:55.483 --> 32:56.950
for the eight months
that we were together.

32:56.951 --> 32:58.552
I had to be totally
silent every single time

32:58.553 --> 32:59.853
that your mother called
so she wouldn't hear my voice.

32:59.854 --> 33:00.887
It was kind of difficult to figure out

33:00.888 --> 33:01.888
how that was gonna work

33:01.889 --> 33:04.191
for, you know, a lifetime.

33:04.192 --> 33:05.392
But I get it.

33:05.393 --> 33:07.260
You're the "right guy"...
you're Pakistani.

33:07.261 --> 33:08.829
I'm half Pakistani.

33:08.830 --> 33:10.330
I think my mother saw that
as a compromise.

33:10.331 --> 33:11.798
I'm the compromise?

33:11.799 --> 33:13.166
- Wow.
- Look, man,

33:13.167 --> 33:14.234
I didn't mean to come up on you
like this.

33:14.235 --> 33:16.102
I'm not a stalker or anything.

33:16.103 --> 33:17.537
I just had to see the guy

33:17.538 --> 33:18.972
that Afia wouldn't be ashamed to love.

33:18.973 --> 33:20.340
MATT: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:20.341 --> 33:21.675
Come on. This is a first date.

33:21.676 --> 33:23.410
Nobody's talking love.

33:23.411 --> 33:25.111
Unless this is going better
than I thought.

33:25.112 --> 33:27.214
Ryan, how can you show up like this

33:27.215 --> 33:29.015
when you were the one
who didn't even want to talk

33:29.016 --> 33:30.283
about our relationship?

33:30.284 --> 33:32.519
I was waiting for you
to take the leap.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.222
I wanted you to choose me over them.

33:35.223 --> 33:37.424
I... Isn't that how
this is supposed to work?

33:37.425 --> 33:40.560
But I see it's a lot easier
for you just to move on, so...

33:40.561 --> 33:41.862
Move on?

33:41.863 --> 33:43.730
I can't even listen to the radio.

33:43.731 --> 33:46.433
Every song reminds me of you.

33:46.434 --> 33:49.769
I can't even go to Adams Morgan
and walk by our favorite places.

33:49.770 --> 33:51.872
You weren't too upset
to come out tonight.

33:51.873 --> 33:53.039
It's Georgetown.

33:53.040 --> 33:56.443
We never came here.

33:56.444 --> 33:58.879
Don't you get it, you idiot?

33:58.880 --> 34:01.180
You broke my heart.

34:05.819 --> 34:08.788
RYAN: Look, man, I'm... sorry.

34:08.789 --> 34:11.090
I didn't mean to derail your night.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.261
I'll get out of here.

Olivia Pedilla is finally freed

34:22.335 --> 34:24.371
after being kidnapped
and held for ransom

getting the Pedillas there so quickly.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.080
Nadine would be very proud.

34:36.382 --> 34:38.418
Her parents have traveled here
from the United States

34:38.418 --> 34:39.518
to bring their daughter home.

34:39.520 --> 34:40.654
Let's go now to President...

34:40.655 --> 34:42.155
Thank God.

34:42.156 --> 34:43.822
There's President Tejeda.

34:43.824 --> 34:45.025
This should be good.

34:49.797 --> 34:52.831
an extensive and exhaustive
crackdown on gang members,

we were able to locate the whereabouts

34:55.335 --> 34:59.773
of the 15 selfless aid workers
being held hostage.

34:59.774 --> 35:03.643
I personally spoke
to the leader of FT-88,

35:03.644 --> 35:06.012
and when he tried to reason with me,

35:06.013 --> 35:08.882
I stopped him and I said,
"This is not a chance

35:08.883 --> 35:12.352
"to justify yourself.
This is not a negotiation.

More and more by the minute.

35:21.929 --> 35:23.563
Question is, can we work with her?

35:23.564 --> 35:25.665
Sure as hell beats the alternative.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.968
Isn't that for the Honduran
people to decide?

35:27.969 --> 35:29.669
RUSSELL: Seriously?

35:29.670 --> 35:32.272
You think we should out her
to her constituents?

35:32.273 --> 35:34.741
Talk about putting your thumb
on the scale. Huh.

35:34.742 --> 35:36.309
She'd be toast after that.

35:36.310 --> 35:38.778
Or maybe she'd find
a way to explain it,

35:38.779 --> 35:40.880
or to justify it.

35:40.881 --> 35:44.184
Let's game out a Maynor Fonseca
presidency, shall we?

35:44.185 --> 35:47.520
Honduras quickly turns
away from the U.S.

Democratic norms

erode further,

35:50.458 --> 35:53.259

authoritarian tendencies,

of people to flee north

we're trying to stop.

36:01.435 --> 36:03.737
that President Tejeda is any better.

36:03.738 --> 36:05.071
I mean, this stunt of hers

36:05.072 --> 36:07.674
clearly exposes her

36:07.675 --> 36:11.811

Liberty is a well-armed lamb
contesting the vote."

37:32.118 --> 37:34.419
Benjamin Franklin.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.921
A good quipper.

37:35.922 --> 37:39.291
And only the truth can give
the lamb a fighting chance.

37:39.292 --> 37:41.727
Correct.

37:41.728 --> 37:43.962
- They're ready.
- Okay.

37:43.963 --> 37:45.263
Okay.

37:54.907 --> 37:56.275
Morning.

37:56.276 --> 37:58.210
(REPORTERS MURMUR GREETINGS)

37:58.211 --> 38:01.302
Unfortunately, I am here this morning

38:01.303 --> 38:03.738
to reveal some disturbing information

38:03.739 --> 38:05.740
that has recently come to light

38:05.741 --> 38:08.343
during the Honduran hostage situation.

38:08.344 --> 38:11.079
Early intelligence had indicated

38:11.080 --> 38:15.149
that the captured aid workers
had been taken by FT-88.

38:15.150 --> 38:16.951
We have now learned that it was

38:16.952 --> 38:19.620
President Tejeda's own Secret Service

38:19.621 --> 38:21.956
that carried out the crime
at her direction.

38:21.957 --> 38:24.726
That's all we are able
to tell you right now,

38:24.727 --> 38:25.660
so, unfortunately, I'm not going

38:25.661 --> 38:27.395
to be able to take any questions.

38:27.396 --> 38:29.163
Thank you for your time.

38:29.164 --> 38:34.102
Well, there goes Honduras
for another generation.

38:34.103 --> 38:36.127
Maybe the new Honduran
president won't be so bad.

38:36.128 --> 38:39.207
Yeah. A man with no political
experience, who hates the U.S.

38:39.208 --> 38:40.608
What could go wrong?

38:40.609 --> 38:43.211
Speaking of things going wrong,
how was your date?

38:43.212 --> 38:44.846
Okay, I'm out.

38:44.847 --> 38:47.782
It was fine
until her boyfriend showed up.

38:47.783 --> 38:49.083
- Seriously?
- Wait, what?

38:49.084 --> 38:50.418
Yeah, you're gonna want in on this.

38:50.419 --> 38:51.986
This is the date
that their Pakistani parents

38:51.987 --> 38:53.254
- set them up on.
- Pakistani.

38:53.255 --> 38:54.789
What happened to Ronnie Baker?

38:54.790 --> 38:56.023
They broke up because
she's moving away.

38:56.024 --> 38:56.991
Go on.

38:56.992 --> 38:58.493
MATT: So this guy, Ryan, was white,

38:58.494 --> 39:01.028
surfer brah white, okay?

39:01.029 --> 39:03.297
And Afia's family was
not down with that.

39:03.298 --> 39:05.666
So, because Afia was hiding Ryan

39:05.667 --> 39:08.002
from her family, he was
unwilling to commit.

39:08.003 --> 39:09.771
You can't try the long distance thing?

39:09.772 --> 39:10.738
Shh. We moved past that.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.273
- Continue.
- She was like,

39:12.274 --> 39:13.541
"You wouldn't commit,"

39:13.542 --> 39:14.842
and he was like,
"You wouldn't fight for me,"

39:14.843 --> 39:16.144
and she was like,
"You broke my heart."

39:16.145 --> 39:17.111
Starts sobbing.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.213
So I sit them both down

39:19.214 --> 39:20.782
and give them a good talking-to

39:20.783 --> 39:22.350
about how they're missing the point.

39:22.351 --> 39:23.785
<i>- You</i> did?
- Yes.

39:23.786 --> 39:25.119
'Cause it was crystal clear.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.687
They were in love

39:26.688 --> 39:28.322
and if they didn't take
a good, hard look at that,

39:28.323 --> 39:29.557
they could be losing something

39:29.558 --> 39:31.759
that they might never find again.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.929
I mean, with matters of the heart,

39:34.930 --> 39:37.230
it's all about risk.

39:39.967 --> 39:41.302
Do you hear yourself?

39:41.303 --> 39:44.405
What?

39:44.406 --> 39:46.706
Okay, now I'm out.

39:52.046 --> 39:53.381
Wait!

39:53.382 --> 39:54.715
Hey, wait!

39:54.716 --> 39:56.250
(PANTING): Just wa...

39:56.251 --> 39:57.585
Hey.

39:57.586 --> 39:59.086
Hey, what are you doing here?

39:59.087 --> 40:01.856
(BREATHLESS): Just...
just hold on a second.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.991
Are you okay?

40:03.992 --> 40:05.059
I will be.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.494
Just, yeah... give me a minute.

40:06.495 --> 40:09.197
Look, I'm sorry,
but I've got to catch a flight.

40:09.198 --> 40:12.633
Okay. Uh... just l-listen.

40:12.634 --> 40:15.203
I really like you.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.940
And I know, uh, I said
we should be adult and...

40:18.941 --> 40:20.908
Clear-eyed and level-headed.

40:20.909 --> 40:22.109
Right.

40:22.110 --> 40:23.644
Everybody thinks you're a dreamer,

40:23.645 --> 40:24.946
but you're really a pragmatist...

40:24.947 --> 40:26.514
Okay, we don't have to go
through the whole thing.

40:26.515 --> 40:28.549
Something happened

40:28.550 --> 40:30.818
that made me realize

40:30.819 --> 40:32.753
I'm an idiot.

40:32.754 --> 40:37.024
I mean, every relationship
is challenged by something.

40:37.025 --> 40:39.794
And-and long distance isn't
the end of the world.

40:39.795 --> 40:41.394
I mean, people do make it work.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.298
I think I was just
trying to protect myself

40:44.299 --> 40:46.934
from getting hurt, which is dumb,

40:46.935 --> 40:49.804
because caring about someone enough

40:49.805 --> 40:53.241
to risk getting hurt is, like,

40:53.242 --> 40:56.177
the best thing in the world.

40:56.178 --> 40:59.146
Captain Ronnie Baker,

40:59.147 --> 41:02.416
I want to take a chance

41:02.417 --> 41:06.354
on getting my heart hammered with you.

41:06.355 --> 41:08.455
Do you have any interest
in that at all?

41:16.297 --> 41:18.366
(BOTH LAUGH)

41:18.367 --> 41:20.434
(ENGINE STARTS)

41:20.435 --> 41:22.769
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:29.877 --> 41:31.979
Hey, careful driving, guy!

41:31.980 --> 41:35.016
That's my girlfriend!

41:35.017 --> 41:38.386
I think they'll want to hang
out with us again, right?

41:38.387 --> 41:39.420
Yeah.

41:39.421 --> 41:41.789
Soon, they said.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.391
I mean, interrupting the evening

41:43.392 --> 41:46.527
for a work thing, that's not
the same as canceling.

41:46.528 --> 41:48.863
Interrupting at the second location.

41:48.864 --> 41:50.698
- That's right.
- Yeah.

41:50.699 --> 41:52.833
Look, our lives are going
to be what they are

41:52.834 --> 41:54.669
and our friends are just gonna
have to understand.

41:54.670 --> 41:56.404
And we're gonna have to, you know,

41:56.405 --> 41:57.838
make a little extra effort.

41:57.839 --> 41:59.740
Right.

41:59.741 --> 42:01.876
Did you get the really good cheese?

42:01.877 --> 42:03.244
- The one I told you about?
- Mm-hmm.

42:03.245 --> 42:04.744
Triple cream.

42:10.084 --> 42:12.786
(DOORBELL RINGS)

42:13.955 --> 42:16.123
- ELIZABETH: Dolly, hi.
- HENRY: Hi.

42:16.124 --> 42:17.391
Happy... We missed your birthday,

42:17.392 --> 42:19.026

- We were in the neighborhood.

42:19.027 --> 42:21.362
...we would... Happy...

- JOHN: Well,
