<b>and then if you can give</b>
<b>a little, we can...</b>

08:41.621 --> 08:42.489
<b>- Absolutely.</b>

08:42.589 --> 08:43.056
<b>- Hit this one out of the park.</b>

08:43.123 --> 08:45.893
<b>- You ready?</b>

08:46.059 --> 08:47.899
<b>If it stings a little,</b>
<b>that means it's working.</b>

08:58.472 --> 08:59.740
<b>- Megan Jean's</b>
<b>not looking out for me,</b>

08:59.840 --> 09:01.240
<b>so she's not</b>
<b>in my alliance anymore.</b>

09:03.810 --> 09:05.512
<b>- They're all too low.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

09:05.612 --> 09:08.015
<b>- They're, like,</b>
<b>creeping down real close</b>

09:08.048 --> 09:09.049
<b>to those knuckles, you know?</b>

09:09.149 --> 09:10.709
<b>- Thanks, man.</b>
<b>- But I mean, style-wise,</b>

09:10.751 --> 09:12.119
<b>it's perfect.</b>

09:12.219 --> 09:13.020
<b>- All right, guys.</b>
<b>One hour remaining.</b>

09:13.053 --> 09:15.055
<b>One hour to go.</b>

09:19.159 --> 09:21.662
<b> <i>- There's a lot of stress</i> </b>
<b> <i>going into this knuckle tattoo,</i> </b>

09:21.762 --> 09:22.962
<b>because it's negative letters.</b>

09:23.030 --> 09:24.831
<b>Since you're making it negative,</b>
<b>it's got to be,</b>

09:24.932 --> 09:26.466
<b>like, thicker parts</b>
<b>in it, you know?</b>

09:26.567 --> 09:27.467
<b>I have to tattoo</b>
<b>the outside of the finger,</b>

09:27.568 --> 09:29.736
<b>and not the inside</b>
<b>of the letters.</b>

09:29.837 --> 09:30.938
<b>Sit still.</b>

09:31.038 --> 09:33.740
<b> <i>I can't make them too small</i> </b>
<b> <i>or too thin,</i> </b>

09:33.841 --> 09:34.942
<b>or else they'll close up</b>
<b>over time.</b>

09:35.042 --> 09:36.543
<b>Keep them real nice and clean.</b>

09:36.643 --> 09:38.745
<b>I have to be super careful.</b>

09:38.846 --> 09:39.926
<b> <i>- Normally, I trust my gut.</i> </b>

09:40.047 --> 09:43.817
<b>After the bewildering critique</b>
<b>I got last week,</b>

09:43.917 --> 09:45.652
<b>I'm second-guessing myself.</b>

09:45.752 --> 09:47.688
<b>- These rays are totally</b>
<b>[bleep].</b>

09:47.788 --> 09:49.790
<b> <i>The outside shape</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you created</i> </b>

09:49.890 --> 09:51.525
<b> <i>with this squared-off pattern</i> </b>

09:51.625 --> 09:52.693
<b>is totally [bleep].</b>

09:52.793 --> 09:55.562
<b>- I feel like...</b>
<b>what do you think?</b>

09:55.662 --> 09:56.663
<b>- This is lovely.</b>

09:56.763 --> 09:58.498
<b> <i>- I'm feeling a lot of pressure</i> </b>

09:58.599 --> 10:00.033
<b>to live up to what everyone</b>
<b>is expecting from me.</b>

10:00.133 --> 10:02.236
<b>[chuckles nervously]</b>

10:03.537 --> 10:04.838
<b>- Five, four,</b>

10:04.938 --> 10:06.874
<b>three,</b>

10:06.974 --> 10:07.875
<b>two,</b>

<b>- Yeah, definitely.</b>

10:13.146 --> 10:14.615
<b>Come here.</b> <b>- Thank you.</b>

10:14.715 --> 10:16.817
<b>- It's definitely my style, so...</b>
<b>- Awesome.</b>

10:16.917 --> 10:18.452
<b> <i>- Where's Sarah</i> </b>

10:18.552 --> 10:19.686
<b>A dumpster?</b>

10:19.786 --> 10:20.587
<b> <i>I can't believe</i> </b>
<b> <i>that Sarah is such a specialist</i> </b>

10:20.687 --> 10:23.490

<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

10:27.060 --> 10:29.830
<b>- Okay, artists, it's now time</b>
<b>to critique your work.</b>

10:29.930 --> 10:33.000
<b>Mattie, when I heard the idea</b>
<b>of the negative lettering,</b>

10:33.100 --> 10:34.234
<b> <i>I wasn't quite sure</i> </b>
<b> <i>how that would go,</i> </b>

10:34.334 --> 10:35.802
<b> <i>and I think you did</i> </b>
<b> <i>a really great job here.</i> </b>

10:35.903 --> 10:38.739
<b>- I tried to be really precise</b>
<b>with the lines.</b>

10:38.839 --> 10:40.741
<b> <i>I used some stippling</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the background</i> </b>

10:40.841 --> 10:42.761
<b> <i>so it doesn't get</i> </b>
<b> <i>all muddied up as time goes on.</i> </b>

10:42.843 --> 10:45.145
<b>- The way you did this was</b>
<b>the smart move.</b>

10:45.245 --> 10:46.947
<b> <i>The stipple effect</i> </b>
<b> <i>gives it a nice fade,</i> </b>

10:47.047 --> 10:49.016
<b> <i>gives him the negative approach</i> </b>
<b> <i>that he wanted.</i> </b>

10:49.116 --> 10:50.651
<b>Great job.</b>

10:50.751 --> 10:52.019
<b>- Sausage.</b>

10:52.119 --> 10:55.589
<b>When you got here,</b>
<b>you insisted no black.</b>

10:55.689 --> 10:56.689
<b>What happened?</b>

10:56.723 --> 10:58.225
<b>- I listened to my artist.</b>

10:58.325 --> 10:59.726
<b> <i>- I think the color</i> </b>
<b> <i>came out nice,</i> </b>

10:59.826 --> 11:02.596
<b> <i>but your line work is lacking</i> </b>
<b> <i>some precision here.</i> </b>

11:02.696 --> 11:03.797
<b>You have some discrepancies</b>

11:03.897 --> 11:05.165
<b>in some of the lines</b>
<b>where your lines end.</b>

11:05.265 --> 11:07.634
<b> <i>Some of 'em trail off.</i> </b>
<b> <i>Some of 'em end bluntly.</i> </b>

11:07.734 --> 11:09.503
<b>- Particularly on the bottom</b>
<b>of the "F."</b>

11:09.603 --> 11:13.774
<b> <i>It just doesn't end as nicely</i> </b>
<b> <i>as the "I"s or the "R."</i> </b>

11:13.874 --> 11:14.808
<b>- Sausage did a bad tattoo.</b>

11:14.908 --> 11:17.177
<b>He just didn't make</b>
<b>good decisions.</b>

11:17.277 --> 11:18.812
<b>He's totally screwed.</b>

11:18.912 --> 11:21.281
<b>- Jime, one of the great tests</b>
<b>of precision</b>

11:21.381 --> 11:22.583
<b> <i>is when you have two</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the same letters.</i> </b>

11:22.683 --> 11:24.952
<b> <i>Keeping those letters similar,</i> </b>

11:25.085 --> 11:26.565
<b> <i>which you've done here</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the "S" s,</i> </b>

11:26.620 --> 11:28.088
<b>and it's delicate and feminine.</b>

11:28.155 --> 11:30.090
<b>I think it's exactly</b>
<b>what she wanted.</b>

11:30.157 --> 11:31.525
<b>Christian.</b>

11:31.625 --> 11:33.093
<b>- The most impressive part</b>
<b>about your tattoo</b>

11:33.126 --> 11:35.929
<b> <i>is how perfectly they line up</i> </b>
<b> <i>straight across both knuckles.</i> </b>

11:36.096 --> 11:38.532
<b>This is probably the straightest</b>
<b>lettering of the day.</b>

11:38.632 --> 11:39.766
<b> <i>- Precision in this really</i> </b>

11:39.867 --> 11:42.002
<b> <i>is your application</i> </b>
<b> <i>with your color.</i> </b>

11:42.102 --> 11:43.103
<b> <i>It's a good job.</i> </b>

11:43.170 --> 11:44.204
<b>- Thanks.</b>
<b>- Anthony.</b>

11:44.304 --> 11:46.540
<b> <i>- Your big lines</i> </b>
<b> <i>are all bold and solid,</i> </b>

11:46.640 --> 11:48.108
<b> <i>but I got to call you out</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the precision.</i> </b>

11:48.208 --> 11:50.744
<b> <i>The consistency in the small</i> </b>
<b> <i>lines is very wavering.</i> </b>

11:50.844 --> 11:52.913
<b>- You're spelling</b>
<b>"killa" a certain way,</b>

11:53.013 --> 11:54.573
<b> <i>so you're already</i> </b>
<b> <i>dealing with something</i> </b>

11:54.648 --> 11:56.216
<b> <i>that's difficult to read,</i> </b>

11:56.316 --> 11:59.152
<b>and then you got</b>
<b>a very elaborate font there.</b>

11:59.253 --> 12:01.188
<b>Maybe not the most</b>
<b>legible thing.</b>

12:01.288 --> 12:03.323
<b>Megan Jean.</b>

12:03.423 --> 12:04.863
<b> <i>- Your tattoos</i> </b>
<b> <i>stand out really bold,</i> </b>

12:04.958 --> 12:06.960
<b> <i>and when you look at 'em close,</i> </b>
<b> <i>they look very clean.</i> </b>

12:07.060 --> 12:08.095
<b>There's only one discrepancy</b>

12:08.195 --> 12:10.764
<b>on the way you did</b>
<b>the traditional "A" s.</b>

12:10.864 --> 12:12.833
<b> <i>You have the line going</i> </b>
<b> <i>through the open part</i> </b>

12:12.933 --> 12:15.133
<b> <i>of the "A" instead of it</i> </b>
<b> <i>just coming out from behind it,</i> </b>

12:15.202 --> 12:16.362
<b>but I think it's very strong.</b>

12:16.436 --> 12:17.971
<b>These tattoos are gonna hold.</b>
<b>- Cleen.</b>

12:18.071 --> 12:21.308
<b>- They're definitely very</b>
<b>strong, bold tattoos.</b>

12:21.408 --> 12:22.709
<b> <i>The black is nice.</i> </b>
<b> <i>The little bit</i> </b>

12:22.809 --> 12:24.845
<b> <i>of the gray highlights</i> </b>
<b> <i>give it finesse.</i> </b>

12:24.945 --> 12:26.914
<b>- You have three letters</b>
<b>that you have on both fingers.</b>

12:27.080 --> 12:28.600
<b> <i>You have the "L," the "I,"</i> </b>
<b> <i>and the "E."</i> </b>

12:28.682 --> 12:30.584
<b> <i>They all match perfectly,</i> </b>
<b> <i>which really shows</i> </b>

12:30.684 --> 12:33.153
<b>that you're able to mimic</b>
<b>your own lettering repeatedly.</b>

12:33.253 --> 12:35.088
<b>That's strong.</b> <b>- Thanks.</b>

12:35.122 --> 12:35.756
<b>- Sarah.</b>

12:35.856 --> 12:37.257
<b>- Some of the lines look</b>

12:37.357 --> 12:38.625
<b>a little more sculpted</b>
<b>than others.</b>

12:38.725 --> 12:40.194
<b> <i>The farthest right portion</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the "W"</i> </b>

12:40.294 --> 12:41.762
<b> <i>is a little bit close</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the center,</i> </b>

12:41.862 --> 12:43.730
<b>so aging over time,</b>
<b>you could have an issue there.</b>

12:43.830 --> 12:46.733
<b>- And you missed the mark</b>
<b>on the "O" s.</b>

12:46.834 --> 12:49.870
<b> <i>The style of font that you</i> </b>
<b> <i>chose made it very difficult</i> </b>

12:49.970 --> 12:52.105
<b>to get those concentric lines</b>
<b>on a finger.</b>

12:52.139 --> 12:54.908
<b>It just looked like</b>
<b>a crappy oblong donut.</b>

12:55.008 --> 12:56.109
<b> <i>- Am I nuts?</i> </b>

12:56.176 --> 12:57.344
<b>We're not looking</b>
<b>at the same tattoos here.</b>

12:57.444 --> 13:00.047
<b> <i>Why are they singling me out?</i> </b>

13:00.080 --> 13:02.416
<b>It's put a seed</b>
<b>of doubt in my head.</b>

13:04.351 --> 13:05.819
<b>- Holy [bleep].</b>

13:05.919 --> 13:08.055
<b>- If I [ bleep] up... I can't.</b>
<b>I just can't.</b>

13:08.155 --> 13:10.657
<b>All I can do is, like,</b>
<b>[bleep] pray.</b>

13:10.757 --> 13:11.825
<b>- You're trying</b>
<b>to throw me under the bus.</b>

13:11.925 --> 13:13.627
<b>- Are you [bleep] kidding me?</b>

13:13.727 --> 13:14.795
<b>I'm a [ bleep] grown man,</b>

13:14.895 --> 13:16.295

<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

13:23.135 --> 13:24.336
<b>- All right, guys.</b>

13:24.436 --> 13:26.338
<b>Today we're testing precision</b>
<b>with knuckle tattoos.</b>

13:26.438 --> 13:28.118
<b> <i>- Sarah's tattoo's probably</i> </b>
<b> <i>one of the most</i> </b>

13:28.174 --> 13:29.141
<b> <i>un-precise ones of the day.</i> </b>

13:29.241 --> 13:31.277
<b>Trying to do concentric</b>
<b>with two circles</b>

13:31.377 --> 13:32.978
<b>inside each other on the finger,</b>

13:33.078 --> 13:35.514
<b> <i>it just showcases</i> </b>
<b> <i>every little mistake.</i> </b>

13:35.614 --> 13:37.683
<b>- I really dislike</b>
<b>Sausage's tattoo.</b>

13:37.783 --> 13:39.118
<b> <i>- A lot of problems</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the line weights.</i> </b>

13:39.218 --> 13:41.954
<b> <i>A lot of problems with</i> </b>
<b> <i>how the lettering is placed.</i> </b>

13:42.054 --> 13:43.222
<b>When he's uncomfortable,</b>

13:43.322 --> 13:45.558
<b>you can see the struggle</b>
<b>in his finished product.</b>

13:45.658 --> 13:47.059
<b>- Who's in the lead here?</b>

13:47.159 --> 13:50.062
<b> <i>- Christian definitely had</i> </b>
<b> <i>the most precise layout.</i> </b>

13:50.162 --> 13:52.398
<b> <i>It's very clear.</i> </b>
<b> <i>It's very legible.</i> </b>

13:52.498 --> 13:53.732
<b>It's a great job.</b>

13:53.833 --> 13:55.634
<b> <i>- I think Cleen really shows</i> </b>
<b> <i>precision in his tattoo,</i> </b>

13:55.734 --> 13:58.070
<b> <i>because he matches</i> </b>
<b> <i>three like letters</i> </b>

13:58.170 --> 13:59.638
<b> <i>over the course</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the two hands,</i> </b>

13:59.738 --> 14:02.374
<b>so he repeats six times</b>
<b>the same lettering style</b>

14:02.475 --> 14:04.443
<b>and really nails</b>
<b>the craftsmanship of the letter.</b>

14:04.543 --> 14:05.444
<b>- You want to let 'em know?</b>

14:05.544 --> 14:06.745
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- Let's do it.</b>

14:08.080 --> 14:10.249
<b>Today, you had to use precision</b>

14:10.349 --> 14:14.153

<b>make a noticeable statement.</b>

14:14.253 --> 14:17.089

<b>the winner</b>

14:17.189 --> 14:19.525

14:19.625 --> 14:21.527
<b>is Cleen Rock One.</b>

14:21.627 --> 14:24.530
<b>- Cleen, I think you really</b>
<b>showed off today with precision,</b>

14:24.630 --> 14:25.764
<b>because you matched</b>
<b>those same letters.</b>

14:25.865 --> 14:28.667
<b> <i>You matched the "L"s;</i> </b>
<b> <i>you matched the "I"s,</i> </b>

14:28.767 --> 14:30.236
<b>and you matched the "E" s</b>
<b>in that hand style,</b>

14:30.369 --> 14:32.638
<b>and I think you did</b>
<b>a really good job.</b>

14:32.738 --> 14:35.474

<b>to assign the human canvases</b>

14:35.574 --> 14:37.276
<b>for the elimination tattoo.</b>

<b>Cleen won again.</b>

14:39.111 --> 14:40.111
<b>This is bull[bleep].</b>

14:40.146 --> 14:41.380
<b>- Head back to the loft,</b>

<b>and prepare to find out</b>
<b>who you must battle next.</b>

14:47.520 --> 14:51.290

<b>because Megan picked it.</b>

14:51.390 --> 14:52.758
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- She did not help us out, dude.</b>

14:52.858 --> 14:53.659

14:53.759 --> 14:55.194
<b>Help each other out.</b> <b>- Right.</b>

14:55.294 --> 14:56.395
<b>- She didn't even do it.</b>
<b>- And then she hands it</b>

14:58.764 --> 14:59.832

<b>after her boyfriend,</b>

<b>This thing is getting so</b>
<b>out of control.</b>

15:48.681 --> 15:50.115
<b>- The veteran</b>
<b>you're about to meet</b>

15:50.216 --> 15:54.153
<b>is world-renowned for</b>
<b>his unique new-school tattoos.</b>

15:54.253 --> 15:56.088

15:56.188 --> 15:59.258
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

16:00.726 --> 16:03.395

<b>- Wow.</b>

16:09.268 --> 16:12.671

<b> <i>He is definitely someone</i> </b>

<b>it's gonna work</b>
<b>out to my advantage.</b>

16:20.613 --> 16:22.693
<b>- The person who's gonna cash</b>

<b>that can do anything</b>
<b>that walks into the shop.</b>

16:24.350 --> 16:27.119

16:28.554 --> 16:29.722
<b>You totally [bleep] it up.</b>

16:29.822 --> 16:31.357

<b>but what you need to do</b>
<b>is get great at everything else.</b>

16:33.425 --> 16:36.495

16:39.465 --> 16:40.399

16:46.005 --> 16:48.474
<b>This week you are</b>

16:48.574 --> 16:50.676
<b>What's the next</b>
<b>elimination tattoo?</b>

16:53.946 --> 16:56.816
<b>- Today we're gonna do</b>
<b>black-and-gray portraits.</b>

16:56.916 --> 16:59.718
<b>- What?</b>

16:59.819 --> 17:01.387
<b>- Why did you make</b>
<b>that decision?</b>

17:01.487 --> 17:04.390
<b>- I got eliminated season two</b>
<b>for a black-and-gray portrait,</b>

17:04.455 --> 17:06.692
<b>and I just wanted to, you know,</b>
<b>start off where I left off.</b>

17:06.791 --> 17:08.828
<b>I've put a lot of effort</b>

17:15.768 --> 17:17.169
<b>What the hell, Jesse?</b>
<b>You're a new-school artist.</b>

17:17.336 --> 17:19.338
<b>Why would you choose this?</b>

17:19.405 --> 17:21.473
<b> <i>- Picking portraits</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a power move,</i> </b>

17:21.574 --> 17:22.854
<b>and I'm not here to mess around.</b>

17:22.907 --> 17:24.477
<b>I'm here to win</b>
<b>this competition.</b>

17:24.577 --> 17:27.512
<b>- Jesse, have a seat.</b>
<b>Guys, you heard him.</b>

17:27.613 --> 17:30.583
<b>You must tattoo</b>
<b>a black-and-gray portrait,</b>

17:30.683 --> 17:31.684
<b>but that's not all.</b>

17:31.784 --> 17:35.588
<b>Your canvases</b>
<b>all want tattoos...</b>

17:35.688 --> 17:37.723
<b>of their personal</b>
<b>political hero.</b>

17:37.823 --> 17:39.191
<b>- What?</b>

17:39.358 --> 17:41.393
<b>- Everyone knows what political</b>
<b>figures look like,</b>

17:41.494 --> 17:43.229
<b> <i>so if we make one mistake,</i> </b>

17:43.362 --> 17:44.196
<b>your average person</b>
<b>is gonna know it.</b>

17:44.363 --> 17:46.732
<b>- Let's meet your canvases.</b>

17:46.832 --> 17:49.902
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

17:51.003 --> 17:52.538
<b>Cleen, you won</b>
<b>the flash challenge.</b>

17:52.638 --> 17:55.374
<b>You now have the power</b>
<b>to assign the canvases.</b>

17:55.441 --> 17:58.410
<b>The smallest choices</b>
<b>can determine your fate.</b>

17:58.511 --> 18:00.846
<b>So choose carefully.</b>

18:00.946 --> 18:02.448
<b>- I'm so thankful I have</b>
<b>the skull picks right now,</b>

18:02.548 --> 18:04.750
<b> <i>'cause I suck</i> </b>
<b> <i>at doing portraits.</i> </b>

18:04.850 --> 18:06.552
<b>So what are we gonna get here?</b>

18:06.652 --> 18:08.254
<b>- Bill Clinton.</b>
<b>- All right.</b>

18:08.387 --> 18:10.422
<b> <i>I need to figure out</i> </b>
<b> <i>the canvas that I feel</i> </b>

18:10.523 --> 18:11.723
<b>I can do the best tattoo with.</b>

18:11.790 --> 18:12.925
<b>Let's see what you got.</b>

18:13.025 --> 18:16.028
<b>- George Washington.</b>
<b>- Thomas Jefferson.</b>

18:17.530 --> 18:19.565
<b> <i>- I really hope I don't get one</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the paintings.</i> </b>

18:19.665 --> 18:20.905
<b> <i>I would much rather do a photo,</i> </b>

18:20.933 --> 18:22.535
<b> <i>because it's</i> </b>
<b> <i>exactly what you see.</i> </b>

18:22.635 --> 18:24.904
<b>A painting is someone else's</b>
<b>artistic interpretation</b>

18:25.004 --> 18:26.639
<b>of what this guy looked like.</b>

18:26.739 --> 18:27.773
<b>- Teddy Roosevelt.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:27.873 --> 18:28.841
<b>And where are you</b>
<b>gonna put it at?</b>

18:28.941 --> 18:32.444
<b>- On my ribs.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

18:32.545 --> 18:33.846
<b> <i>- I do not want this canvas.</i> </b>

18:33.946 --> 18:34.980
<b>The ribs is not the greatest</b>
<b>place to do a portrait.</b>

18:35.080 --> 18:37.349
<b> <i>The skin's very elastic.</i> </b>

18:37.449 --> 18:38.517
<b>The chances of distortion</b>
<b>are very high.</b>

18:38.617 --> 18:42.922
<b>- I'm getting</b>
<b>our president, Obama.</b>

18:43.022 --> 18:45.357
<b>- Ronald Reagan.</b>
<b>- Abraham Lincoln.</b>

18:45.424 --> 18:47.059
<b>- That is a dope picture.</b>

18:49.028 --> 18:50.396
<b>- Hmm.</b>

18:50.496 --> 18:51.664
<b> <i>- Cleen doesn't do portraits</i> </b>
<b> <i>at all.</i> </b>

18:51.764 --> 18:52.964
<b>If he has a brain in his head,</b>

18:53.032 --> 18:54.767
<b>he's gonna take one</b>
<b>of the easiest canvases,</b>

18:54.867 --> 18:55.835
<b> <i>which he probably doesn't even</i> </b>
<b> <i>know what that is.</i> </b>

18:55.935 --> 18:58.270
<b>- Jime,</b>
<b>you like doing portraits, right?</b>

18:58.370 --> 18:59.605
<b>- Every day.</b>

18:59.705 --> 19:01.674
<b> <i>- I'm really hoping last week's</i> </b>
<b> <i>trip to the bottom</i> </b>

19:01.774 --> 19:02.875
<b>got Cleen a little bit rattled,</b>

19:02.975 --> 19:04.910
<b>and he drops the ball</b>
<b>again this week.</b>

19:05.010 --> 19:06.712
<b>- Lock it up.</b>

19:06.812 --> 19:08.614
<b>- Okay, canvases, one by one,</b>

19:08.714 --> 19:10.816
<b>please read the artist's name</b>
<b>on the bottom of your skull.</b>

19:10.916 --> 19:14.420
<b>- Sarah.</b>
<b>- Jime.</b>

19:14.520 --> 19:16.388
<b> <i>- This is one</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the hardest ones up there.</i> </b>

19:16.489 --> 19:17.489
<b>The clarity of the photo</b>

19:17.523 --> 19:18.457
<b>is what helps you</b>
<b>create your outline.</b>

19:18.557 --> 19:20.993
<b>It's a painting.</b> <b>It's very hazy.</b>

19:21.093 --> 19:22.093
<b>- Anthony.</b>

19:23.863 --> 19:26.699
<b>- Christian.</b>
<b>- Oh, all right.</b>

19:26.799 --> 19:33.472
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

19:33.572 --> 19:34.773
<b>- Matti.</b>

19:34.874 --> 19:37.343
<b> <i>- This canvas wants Teddy</i> </b>
<b> <i>Roosevelt on his ribs.</i> </b>

19:37.409 --> 19:38.744
<b>This guy's the only person</b>
<b>who was alive</b>

19:38.844 --> 19:40.412
<b>when Roosevelt was president.</b>

19:40.513 --> 19:41.480
<b> <i>I'm pretty sure that as soon</i> </b>
<b> <i>as the needle hits this guy,</i> </b>

19:41.580 --> 19:44.917
<b>he's gonna poof</b>
<b>into a tuft of dust.</b>

19:45.017 --> 19:46.852
<b>- Jesse.</b>
<b>- Welcome to the snake pit.</b>

19:46.952 --> 19:49.855
<b>- I love Obama.</b>
<b>- Sausage.</b>

19:49.955 --> 19:51.957
<b> <i>- Dude, give me Reagan.</i> </b>

19:52.057 --> 19:53.359
<b> <i>It has so many wrinkles.</i> </b>

19:53.459 --> 19:54.360
<b>It's super [bleep] hard.</b>

19:54.460 --> 19:56.462
<b> <i>I will crush that portrait.</i> </b>

19:56.562 --> 19:59.398
<b> <i>Take Lincoln.</i> </b> <b> <i>It's easy.</i> </b>

19:59.498 --> 20:01.433
<b>You'll crush that portrait.</b>

20:01.534 --> 20:04.370
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

20:04.436 --> 20:06.505
<b>- Cleen Rock One.</b>

20:07.907 --> 20:09.441
<b>- What a idiot.</b>

20:09.542 --> 20:11.610
<b>- Remember,</b>
<b>after the elimination tattoo,</b>

20:11.710 --> 20:13.746
<b>the human canvas jury</b>
<b>will vote on the tattoo</b>

20:13.846 --> 20:15.881
<b>that they think is the worst</b>

20:15.981 --> 20:18.350
<b>and put one artist</b>
<b>up for elimination.</b>

20:18.450 --> 20:19.552
<b>You will have six hours</b>
<b>to tattoo a portrait</b>

20:19.652 --> 20:22.888
<b>of a groundbreaking</b>
<b>political figure.</b>

20:22.988 --> 20:24.657
<b>Based on your work,</b>

20:24.757 --> 20:27.493
<b>one of you will close shop.</b>

20:27.593 --> 20:28.794
<b>Good luck.</b>

20:28.894 --> 20:29.995
<b> <i>- Without precision,</i> </b>

20:30.095 --> 20:31.464
<b> <i>there are certain styles</i> </b>
<b> <i>of tattoos</i> </b>

20:31.564 --> 20:33.766
<b>that artists will never</b>
<b>be able to accomplish.</b>

20:33.866 --> 20:35.067
<b> <i>You cannot do a portrait</i> </b>

20:35.167 --> 20:38.604
<b>unless you can put the ink...</b>
<b>put the shading exactly</b>

20:38.704 --> 20:39.738
<b>where it needs to be.</b>

20:39.839 --> 20:41.807
<b>- It's got some great contrast</b>
<b>to him.</b>

20:41.907 --> 20:43.542
<b>We'll get in there, and we'll do</b>
<b>some really cool hair texture</b>

20:43.642 --> 20:45.478
<b>and some really cool detail</b>
<b>in his tie.</b>

20:45.578 --> 20:47.413
<b> <i>- If you cannot do</i> </b>
<b> <i>precise details,</i> </b>

20:47.513 --> 20:50.149
<b>you're not gonna make it</b>
<b>to the end of this competition.</b>

20:52.618 --> 20:54.053
<b>- All right, so you want this</b>
<b>on your arm, right?</b>

20:54.153 --> 20:55.855
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- So here's the thing.</b>

20:55.955 --> 20:59.391
<b>I think the shoulder blade</b>
<b>is gonna be a lot flatter.</b>

20:59.492 --> 21:00.726
<b>- You know, this is a kind</b>
<b>of difficult one,</b>

21:00.826 --> 21:04.597
<b>and, you know, we got</b>
<b>to do some good detail on here.</b>

21:04.697 --> 21:05.865
<b>- This guy's absolutely gonna</b>
<b>be hard to please.</b>

21:05.965 --> 21:07.766
<b>He is nitpicking</b>
<b>every [bleep] thing.</b>

21:07.867 --> 21:09.668
<b>- Notice his nose,</b>
<b>very kind of bulbous.</b>

21:09.768 --> 21:10.836
<b>- Oh, I know</b>
<b>what I'm doing here.</b>

21:10.936 --> 21:12.037
<b>- I know you know</b>
<b>what you're doing,</b>

21:12.138 --> 21:13.806
<b>but I just want you</b>
<b>to win, Matt.</b>

21:13.906 --> 21:15.007
<b>- I really do.</b>
<b>- Well, you know,</b>

21:15.107 --> 21:15.941
<b>you were talking</b>
<b>about getting it on your ribs,</b>

21:16.041 --> 21:17.009
<b>and that's gonna be a tough one.</b>

21:17.109 --> 21:18.777
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>What do you think about that?</b>

21:18.878 --> 21:19.998
<b>- I think we should move it,</b>

21:20.045 --> 21:21.547
<b>because when you do</b>
<b>get a portrait on your ribs</b>

21:21.647 --> 21:23.482
<b>it kind of stretches the face</b>
<b>and moves it around.</b>

21:23.582 --> 21:26.819
<b>- Yeah, I really</b>
<b>wanted it on my ribs.</b>

21:26.919 --> 21:28.554
<b>- You want a terrible tattoo,</b>
<b>or you want a good tattoo?</b>

21:28.654 --> 21:31.624
<b> <i>There's no possible way I'm</i> </b>
<b> <i>tattooing on this guy's ribs.</i> </b>

21:31.724 --> 21:33.626
<b> <i>Anywhere else is better.</i> </b>

21:33.726 --> 21:35.961
<b>- So we got good old Bill.</b>
<b>Think you can do him justice?</b>

21:36.061 --> 21:38.931
<b>- I think I'm going to adjust</b>
<b>the contrast a little bit.</b>

21:39.031 --> 21:41.033
<b>Doing portraits</b>
<b>is my favorite thing,</b>

21:41.133 --> 21:43.169
<b> <i>but with how this competition</i> </b>

<b>I'm second-guessing myself.</b>

21:45.137 --> 21:47.206
<b>I want to detail out</b>
<b>pretty much, like, everything.</b>

21:47.339 --> 21:48.574

21:48.674 --> 21:50.843
<b>You'll kill it.</b>
<b>You know you will.</b>

21:50.943 --> 21:53.679
<b>- Um,</b>
<b>I appreciate your confidence.</b>

21:53.779 --> 21:57.149
<b> <i>I know I can do this,</i> </b>
<b> <i>but at the same time,</i> </b>

<b>If I make one slip... I can't.</b>

22:17.332 --> 22:19.100
<b>I just can't.</b> <b>I can't.</b>

22:19.200 --> 22:21.769
<b>I can't just do, like,</b>

22:21.869 --> 22:22.971

22:23.071 --> 22:25.139
<b>Dude, that's</b>
<b>a complicated stencil.</b>

<b>There's no margin.</b>

22:37.418 --> 22:38.653
<b>Like, I can't not knock this</b>
<b>out of the park.</b>

22:38.753 --> 22:40.755

23:09.550 --> 23:13.855
<b>and your time starts now.</b>

23:13.955 --> 23:15.924
<b>- Up here.</b>
<b>- Every minute counts.</b>

23:16.024 --> 23:18.026
<b>- Shake it off, man.</b>
<b>Stand normal.</b>

23:18.159 --> 23:19.861
<b>- Jesse Smith</b>
<b>comes back swinging,</b>

23:19.961 --> 23:20.561
<b> <i>calls out</i> </b>
<b> <i>black-and-gray portraits.</i> </b>

23:20.662 --> 23:22.297
<b>I love it.</b> <b>- Wow.</b>

23:22.397 --> 23:24.232
<b>It's so surreal now.</b>

23:24.332 --> 23:26.200
<b> <i>- Doing a portrait,</i> </b>
<b> <i>precision is everything.</i> </b>

23:26.301 --> 23:28.803
<b>Every single line,</b>
<b>every single dot,</b>

23:28.903 --> 23:30.004
<b> <i>every single bit of shading</i> </b>
<b> <i>has to be perfect.</i> </b>

23:30.171 --> 23:32.941
<b>If not, your portraits</b>
<b>will look like [bleep].</b>

23:36.978 --> 23:38.980
<b>- What's your favorite style</b>
<b>of tattoo?</b>

23:39.080 --> 23:40.181
<b>- This right here.</b>

23:41.916 --> 23:42.517
<b>If there was</b>
<b>a dictionary definition</b>

23:42.617 --> 23:43.918
<b>of a one-trick pony,</b>

23:44.018 --> 23:46.387
<b> <i>it would have a picture</i> </b>
<b> <i>of Jesse Smith.</i> </b>

23:46.487 --> 23:48.990
<b>He might think that he went out</b>
<b>and practiced portraits,</b>

23:49.090 --> 23:51.759
<b> <i>but he just walked into</i> </b>
<b> <i>a viper's den full of people</i> </b>

23:51.859 --> 23:53.828
<b> <i>who are killer at portraits.</i> </b>

23:56.197 --> 23:58.399
<b>- It's looking good.</b>
<b>- Gonna be pretty rad.</b>

23:58.499 --> 24:00.935
<b>I need to crush this today.</b>

24:01.035 --> 24:02.670
<b> <i>I need to let everybody</i> </b>
<b> <i>know in the house</i> </b>

24:02.770 --> 24:04.339
<b>that this wasn't even</b>
<b>a competition.</b>

24:08.443 --> 24:09.210
<b>- This one.</b>
<b>- Oh.</b>

24:09.310 --> 24:11.212
<b>- I need a little more contrast.</b>

24:11.312 --> 24:13.281
<b>This portrait has</b>
<b>the least opportunity to shine,</b>

24:13.381 --> 24:15.516
<b>because I'm working</b>
<b>on dark skin,</b>

24:15.617 --> 24:17.218
<b> <i>so the ability to create</i> </b>
<b> <i>a massive amount</i> </b>

24:17.318 --> 24:18.319
<b> <i>of contrast is very difficult.</i> </b>

24:18.419 --> 24:20.021
<b>That's the great thing</b>
<b>about this show</b>

24:20.154 --> 24:22.257
<b>is it kind of highlights</b>
<b>your weaknesses.</b>

24:22.357 --> 24:23.858
<b>The one-trick pony</b>
<b>has been the word</b>

24:23.958 --> 24:25.860
<b>that has stuck with me</b>
<b>ever since I left season two.</b>

24:25.960 --> 24:28.229
<b>I came back to shut that down.</b>

24:31.232 --> 24:32.467
<b>- What's up, fellas?</b>
<b>- What is going on?</b>

24:32.567 --> 24:34.235
<b>- So he got you off the ribs?</b>
<b>- Yeah.</b>

24:34.335 --> 24:34.969
<b>- Yeah,</b>
<b>there wasn't any other place,</b>

24:35.069 --> 24:36.069
<b>besides inside calf.</b>

24:36.170 --> 24:37.805
<b> <i>My canvas wanted</i> </b>
<b> <i>Theodore Roosevelt</i> </b>

24:37.905 --> 24:40.508
<b>on his busted-ass,</b> <b>old-ass ribs.</b>

24:40.608 --> 24:43.278
<b> <i>I talked him into getting it</i> </b>
<b> <i>on his calf where it belongs.</i> </b>

24:45.647 --> 24:46.848
<b>[bones crackling]</b>

24:46.948 --> 24:47.315
<b>Oh, you hear that?</b>
<b>- Yeah, there you go.</b>

24:47.415 --> 24:49.083
<b>- Ohh.</b>

24:49.183 --> 24:50.485
<b>- Break it right back</b>
<b>into place.</b>

24:50.585 --> 24:53.187
<b>Cleen's been giving me</b>
<b>bad picks every single time,</b>

24:53.254 --> 24:54.355
<b> <i>but I'm gonna win</i> </b>
<b> <i>the elimination tattoo,</i> </b>

24:54.455 --> 24:56.190
<b> <i>even though you gave me</i> </b>
<b> <i>1,000-year-old skin.</i> </b>

24:56.257 --> 24:59.294
<b>I'll tell you who Cleen</b>
<b>didn't go after: Megan Jean.</b>

24:59.394 --> 25:02.497
<b> <i>What are you doing to make</i> </b>
<b> <i>this guy help you out so good?</i> </b>

25:02.597 --> 25:04.332
<b>Whatever, Cleen.</b> <b>You're done.</b>

25:04.432 --> 25:05.432
<b>- Four hours remaining.</b>

25:07.268 --> 25:09.938
<b>- How's everyone feeling</b>
<b>about portrait day?</b>

25:10.038 --> 25:12.340
<b>- To be honest, there's a lot</b>
<b>of portrait people here.</b>

25:12.440 --> 25:15.143
<b> <i>I don't do portraits, because</i> </b>
<b> <i>there's no artistic freedom.</i> </b>

25:15.176 --> 25:17.145
<b>No artistic liberties.</b>
<b>You got to just do what you see.</b>

25:17.178 --> 25:18.146
<b>The last thing I want to do</b>

25:18.246 --> 25:20.148
<b>is see you come downstairs</b>
<b>and be like,</b>

25:20.181 --> 25:21.416
<b>"the canvas really decided."</b>

25:22.951 --> 25:24.152
<b> <i>I'm here to prove myself</i> </b>
<b> <i>as an artist,</i> </b>

25:24.185 --> 25:25.286
<b>not a human copy machine.</b>

25:25.386 --> 25:26.187
<b> <i>I want to get</i> </b>
<b> <i>through this tattoo</i> </b>

25:26.287 --> 25:27.322
<b> <i>and get to the next challenge</i> </b>

25:27.422 --> 25:30.058
<b>so I can start getting</b>
<b>on top of this game.</b>

25:32.927 --> 25:33.828
<b>- You convinced me</b>
<b>from the get-go.</b>

25:33.928 --> 25:35.163
<b>As soon as I saw your Instagram,</b>

25:35.229 --> 25:36.164
<b>I'm like, "This dude knows</b>
<b>how to do portraits."</b>

25:36.197 --> 25:38.299
<b>- Cleen gives me</b>
<b>George Washington.</b>

25:38.399 --> 25:39.434
<b>I did not want this,</b>

25:39.534 --> 25:40.902
<b>but I specialize</b>
<b>in black-and-gray portraits.</b>

25:41.002 --> 25:43.905
<b>- That looks great, man,</b>
<b>really smooth.</b>

25:44.005 --> 25:45.239
<b> <i>- Cleen is not</i> </b>
<b> <i>a black-and-gray artist.</i> </b>

25:45.340 --> 25:48.009
<b>He's about to get sent home</b>
<b>by a new artist.</b>

25:48.977 --> 25:50.378
<b>- Everybody's really doing good.</b>

25:50.478 --> 25:53.982
<b>- Christian, Megan,</b>
<b>and Sausage are killing it.</b>

25:54.082 --> 25:57.185
<b>- But Sarah's doing</b>
<b>that Clinton face so dark.</b>

25:57.218 --> 25:58.953
<b>That is a concern, is it not?</b>

25:59.053 --> 26:00.855
<b>The devil is gonna be</b>
<b>in the details.</b>

26:00.955 --> 26:03.191
<b>- Today, a really good</b>
<b>tattoo's going home.</b>

26:03.224 --> 26:04.859
<b>- It's gonna be a heartbreaker.</b>

26:04.959 --> 26:06.261
<b>- I know.</b>
<b>- Toughest day ever.</b>

26:11.132 --> 26:12.132
<b>- How's this going?</b>

26:14.135 --> 26:15.370
<b>Stay here.</b>

26:15.470 --> 26:17.138
<b>- It's gnarly this season, huh?</b>
<b>- I know I can do this.</b>

26:17.171 --> 26:19.173
<b>Hoping to come back</b>
<b>from the lumps.</b>

26:21.509 --> 26:23.011
<b>Portraits are my favorite thing.</b>

26:23.144 --> 26:24.412
<b> <i>This is where I need to shine,</i> </b>

26:24.512 --> 26:26.047
<b>and I don't really</b>
<b>see anybody [bleep]</b>

26:26.147 --> 26:28.349
<b>it up too badly,</b>
<b>except for Cleen.</b>

26:28.449 --> 26:29.984
<b>- Thought</b>
<b>you didn't do portraits?</b>

26:30.151 --> 26:31.319
<b>- I don't.</b> <b>I'm winging it.</b>

26:31.419 --> 26:33.554
<b>I'm flipping out right now.</b>
<b>I don't do portraits.</b>

26:33.655 --> 26:35.023
<b>I'm normally pretty</b>
<b>talkative, man,</b>

26:35.156 --> 26:36.157
<b>but I'm focused</b>
<b>as a freight train.</b>

26:36.190 --> 26:39.160
<b>- I think we might be sending</b>
<b>a vet home.</b>

26:39.227 --> 26:40.461
<b>Guess who?</b>

26:42.530 --> 26:43.631
<b> <i>- Now that I'm thinking</i> </b>
<b> <i>about it,</i> </b>

26:43.731 --> 26:45.011
<b> <i>I think I picked</i> </b>
<b> <i>the hardest one.</i> </b>

26:46.401 --> 26:47.402
<b>- Five,</b>

26:47.502 --> 26:48.403
<b>four,</b>

26:48.503 --> 26:50.371
<b>three,</b>

26:50.471 --> 26:52.240
<b>two, one.</b>

26:52.340 --> 26:53.408
<b>That's it.</b> <b>Time is up.</b>

26:53.508 --> 26:55.576
<b>Machines down.</b> <b>No more ink.</b>

26:56.511 --> 26:59.247
<b>- Yeah? Good.</b>

26:59.347 --> 27:01.983
<b>- Check it out.</b>
<b>- Holy [bleep].</b>

27:02.083 --> 27:03.551
<b> <i>- The cheeks on this guy</i> </b>

27:03.651 --> 27:05.091
<b> <i>are the same color</i> </b>
<b> <i>as his black suit.</i> </b>

27:05.186 --> 27:07.555
<b>This poor guy</b>
<b>has a California Raisin</b>

27:07.655 --> 27:10.358
<b>shaped like Bill Clinton</b>
<b>tattooed on him for life.</b>

27:12.327 --> 27:13.161
<b>- It's hard</b>
<b>to even look at your tattoo.</b>

27:13.261 --> 27:15.597
<b>- My tattoo was</b>
<b>[bleep] fantastic.</b>

27:15.697 --> 27:17.265
<b>- You are nuts.</b>
<b>I say it all the time.</b>

27:17.365 --> 27:19.200
<b>- I don't agree with you at all.</b>

27:19.300 --> 27:20.268
<b>- Cleen gets a pass</b>
<b>a lot of times.</b>

27:20.368 --> 27:22.337
<b>- What's up, Christian?</b>
<b>- It was busted.</b>

27:22.437 --> 27:23.597
<b>And it looked like The Joker.</b>

27:28.742 --> 27:31.145
<b> <i>[dramatic music]</i> </b>

27:31.245 --> 27:32.479
<b>- You guys should be worried.</b>

27:32.580 --> 27:35.216
<b>Worst tattoo of the day?</b>
<b>It'd be between the two of you.</b>

27:35.316 --> 27:37.151
<b>- Mine's the better, for sure.</b>

27:37.251 --> 27:39.253
<b>- No. No.</b>
<b>Mine is definitely better.</b>

27:39.353 --> 27:41.689
<b>- Overall...</b>
<b>mine is overall appealing.</b>

27:41.789 --> 27:43.390
<b>Yours is not.</b>
<b>- Yours is overall [bleep] up.</b>

27:43.490 --> 27:45.292
<b>- It's hard</b>
<b>to even look at your tattoo.</b>

27:45.392 --> 27:48.462
<b>Way black.</b>
<b>Just like your last one.</b>

27:48.562 --> 27:51.165
<b>- Everything I do, I do to last.</b>

27:51.265 --> 27:52.433
<b>I look for the longevity</b>
<b>of the tattoo.</b>

27:52.533 --> 27:54.435
<b>- If it's me and you,</b>
<b>I'm not worried at all.</b>

27:54.535 --> 27:55.903
<b>- My tattoo was</b>
<b>[bleep] fantastic.</b>

27:56.003 --> 27:56.704
<b>- [bleep].</b>
<b>- I [bleep] nailed it.</b>

27:56.804 --> 27:58.772
<b>- You are nuts.</b>

27:58.873 --> 28:01.408
<b>You're just talking crazy</b>
<b>out your ass.</b>

28:01.509 --> 28:02.409

28:02.510 --> 28:05.946

<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

28:19.560 --> 28:21.362
<b>- Today, Jesse</b>
<b>challenged you to tattoo</b>

28:21.462 --> 28:24.565
<b>a portrait of a political figure</b>
<b>so well known</b>

28:24.665 --> 28:27.201
<b>that the tiniest flaw</b>
<b>will be obvious.</b>

28:27.301 --> 28:28.836
<b>Jesse, let's begin with you.</b>

28:30.938 --> 28:33.307
<b>I really love the tattoo,</b>
<b>and I honestly can't believe</b>

28:33.407 --> 28:35.743
<b> <i>that this is the same artist</i> </b>

28:35.843 --> 28:38.479
<b> <i>that did black and gray</i> </b>
<b> <i>that we saw in season two.</i> </b>

28:38.579 --> 28:39.547
<b>- I felt it necessary</b>
<b>to prove to you guys</b>

28:39.647 --> 28:41.482
<b>that I could do</b>
<b>a legitimate portrait.</b>

28:41.582 --> 28:43.484
<b>- You took a very soft,</b>
<b>out-of-focus approach</b>

28:43.584 --> 28:45.519
<b> <i>to this tattoo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>and it came out great.</i> </b>

28:45.619 --> 28:46.787
<b> <i>It has a lot of contrast.</i> </b>

28:46.887 --> 28:49.423
<b> <i>You kept his features</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the face correct.</i> </b>

28:49.456 --> 28:51.525
<b>- I completely applaud you</b>
<b>for having the balls</b>

28:51.625 --> 28:53.827
<b>to come back in here</b>
<b>and call this your shot.</b>

28:53.928 --> 28:54.928
<b>Great job.</b>

28:55.796 --> 28:57.932
<b>- Christian.</b>

28:59.066 --> 29:00.834
<b>- As far as capturing</b>
<b>a likeness,</b>

29:00.935 --> 29:04.238
<b> <i>you really get the personality</i> </b>
<b> <i>and the look of this person.</i> </b>

29:04.338 --> 29:05.706
<b> <i>You cut down</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the number of wrinkles,</i> </b>

29:05.806 --> 29:07.241
<b> <i>but kept the direction</i> </b>

29:07.341 --> 29:08.809
<b> <i>and the flow of the wrinkles</i> </b>
<b> <i>just right.</i> </b>

29:08.909 --> 29:10.444
<b>Smart choices</b>
<b>on how to interpret</b>

29:10.511 --> 29:11.545
<b>what's in the real photo.</b>

29:11.645 --> 29:13.881
<b> <i>- The actual way</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you do the hair</i> </b>

29:13.981 --> 29:15.649
<b> <i>coming over that right ear,</i> </b>
<b> <i>perfect.</i> </b>

29:15.749 --> 29:18.652
<b>It's beautiful, because her hair</b>
<b>is really white and light</b>

29:18.752 --> 29:19.920
<b> <i>over that ear.</i> </b> <b> <i>You nail it.</i> </b>

29:20.020 --> 29:21.822
<b> <i>This was a great attention</i> </b>
<b> <i>to detail.</i> </b>

29:21.922 --> 29:23.824
<b>You're definitely ahead</b>
<b>of the curve</b>

29:23.924 --> 29:25.392
<b>when it comes to portraits.</b>

29:26.894 --> 29:28.395
<b>- Jime.</b>

29:29.630 --> 29:30.898
<b>For precision, your Jefferson</b>

29:30.998 --> 29:35.402
<b> <i>looks slightly angrier</i> </b>
<b> <i>than the one in the painting.</i> </b>

29:35.469 --> 29:38.038
<b> <i>His left eye</i> </b>
<b> <i>is a little bit more closed</i> </b>

29:38.138 --> 29:39.673
<b> <i>in yours than in the painting,</i> </b>

29:39.773 --> 29:41.442
<b> <i>and then the lips</i> </b>
<b> <i>are a little bit more pursed.</i> </b>

29:41.542 --> 29:43.577
<b>- What I think</b>
<b>is lacking in here</b>

29:43.677 --> 29:46.413
<b>is shading coming around</b>
<b>the top crown of the head.</b>

29:46.514 --> 29:49.049
<b> <i>The actual hairline</i> </b>
<b> <i>itself is a bit different.</i> </b>

29:49.149 --> 29:50.989
<b> <i>When we're comparing it</i> </b>
<b> <i>directly to a painting,</i> </b>

29:51.051 --> 29:52.051
<b>that's a problem.</b>

29:54.455 --> 29:55.689
<b>- Matti.</b>

29:55.789 --> 29:57.825
<b>- This is definitely</b>
<b>a great take on this photo,</b>

29:57.925 --> 30:00.461
<b> <i>and the contours</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you have over the eyebrows</i> </b>

30:00.561 --> 30:02.596
<b> <i>and the forehead really lock in</i> </b>
<b> <i>his shape in this photo.</i> </b>

30:02.696 --> 30:04.431
<b>- Yeah. He's got</b>
<b>a good scowl going on, man.</b>

30:04.532 --> 30:06.033
<b>- The parts where you missed</b>
<b>a little bit</b>

30:06.133 --> 30:07.968
<b> <i>in precision</i> </b>
<b> <i>are his actual eyes.</i> </b>

30:08.068 --> 30:10.571
<b> <i>You highlighted his eyelid</i> </b>
<b> <i>a little bit too much,</i> </b>

30:10.671 --> 30:11.872
<b> <i>but definitely captures</i> </b>
<b> <i>the look of the photo.</i> </b>

30:11.972 --> 30:14.141
<b>You did a good job.</b>

30:15.809 --> 30:17.878
<b>- Anthony.</b>

30:17.978 --> 30:20.314
<b>- It's evident</b>
<b>that portraits are your thing.</b>

30:20.447 --> 30:21.615
<b> <i>The softness of the shading</i> </b>

30:21.715 --> 30:23.684
<b>where you can't see it start</b>
<b>or finish is great.</b>

30:23.784 --> 30:26.787
<b> <i>All in all,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the interpretation on this?</i> </b>

30:26.887 --> 30:28.622
<b> <i>The eyes, the nose, the mouth,</i> </b>

30:28.722 --> 30:29.890
<b> <i>the divot you have in</i> </b>
<b> <i>the left side of the cheek,</i> </b>

30:29.990 --> 30:32.660
<b> <i>that tiny, little highlight</i> </b>
<b> <i>that you captured?</i> </b>

30:32.760 --> 30:34.094
<b>It's a great job.</b>

30:35.829 --> 30:37.932
<b>- Sausage.</b>

30:38.032 --> 30:39.033
<b> <i>I love this tattoo.</i> </b>

30:39.133 --> 30:40.968
<b> <i>I love what you've done</i> </b>
<b> <i>with the hair.</i> </b>

30:41.068 --> 30:42.536
<b> <i>I love the details in the tie.</i> </b>

30:42.636 --> 30:44.505
<b> <i>In this particular photo,</i> </b>
<b> <i>his eyes</i> </b>

30:44.605 --> 30:46.440
<b> <i>are looking in</i> </b>
<b> <i>slightly different directions,</i> </b>

30:46.540 --> 30:47.980
<b>and you captured that</b>
<b>in your tattoo.</b>

30:48.075 --> 30:49.743
<b>- When you go down to that neck</b>
<b>and you look at that highlight,</b>

30:49.844 --> 30:52.646
<b> <i>the little white hairs</i> </b>
<b> <i>that are showing off that.</i> </b>

30:52.746 --> 30:55.015
<b>I didn't miss that.</b>
<b>That thing was sick.</b>

30:55.115 --> 30:57.035
<b>Probably the best tattoo</b>
<b>you've done here so far.</b>

30:58.085 --> 31:00.454
<b>- Megan Jean.</b>

31:02.156 --> 31:03.891
<b>- Just such a striking image.</b>

31:03.991 --> 31:06.427
<b> <i>It just comes out really tough</i> </b>
<b> <i>and really strong.</i> </b>

31:06.527 --> 31:07.828
<b>- The amount of changes</b>

31:07.928 --> 31:10.030
<b>that you made in the shading</b>
<b>to the left side of the face.</b>

31:10.130 --> 31:11.532
<b> <i>You stuck true to the right,</i> </b>

31:11.632 --> 31:13.868
<b> <i>but you completely shaded</i> </b>
<b> <i>all the way to the left.</i> </b>

31:13.968 --> 31:16.470
<b>What was the reasoning behind</b>
<b>that in a precision challenge?</b>

31:16.570 --> 31:19.974
<b>- In the photo, on his left side</b>
<b>of his face is super bright,</b>

31:20.074 --> 31:21.175
<b> <i>and it was looking flat,</i> </b>

31:21.275 --> 31:23.777
<b>so I thought that I would shift</b>
<b>the light source</b>

31:23.878 --> 31:25.913
<b>just a little bit more</b>
<b>to the front of his face.</b>

31:26.013 --> 31:28.883
<b> <i>- Unfortunately, that's the</i> </b>
<b> <i>precision issue I have with it.</i> </b>

31:28.983 --> 31:30.618
<b>Otherwise,</b>
<b>it's a knockout tattoo.</b>

31:33.220 --> 31:34.522
<b>- Cleen.</b>

31:34.622 --> 31:35.923
<b>- Technically,</b>
<b>it's a strong tattoo.</b>

31:36.023 --> 31:39.093
<b> <i>The details in the tie,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the suit, and the hair</i> </b>

31:39.193 --> 31:40.861
<b> <i>are some of the best</i> </b>
<b> <i>in the room.</i> </b>

31:40.961 --> 31:43.397
<b>But you kind of lose</b>
<b>that genuine look of his smile.</b>

31:43.497 --> 31:45.866
<b>- The shape of the mouth itself.</b>

31:45.966 --> 31:48.402
<b> <i>Reagan has a bump</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the bottom right side</i> </b>

31:48.502 --> 31:51.405
<b>that really comes up,</b>
<b>and you do it pretty straight.</b>

31:51.505 --> 31:52.706
<b> <i>You put a really hard line</i> </b>

31:52.806 --> 31:54.875
<b> <i>in right next</i> </b>
<b> <i>to the right nostril.</i> </b>

31:54.975 --> 31:56.677
<b>That gives the nose</b>
<b>a different shape</b>

31:56.777 --> 31:58.078
<b> <i>than what it looks</i> </b>
<b> <i>like in the photo.</i> </b>

31:58.179 --> 31:59.947
<b>But for a guy</b>
<b>that doesn't do portraits,</b>

32:00.047 --> 32:02.816
<b>you definitely did</b>
<b>a decent portrait here.</b>

32:02.917 --> 32:05.519
<b>- I think that was busted,</b>
<b>and it looked like the Joker.</b>

32:05.619 --> 32:07.955
<b>Cleen gets a pass</b>
<b>a lot of times.</b>

32:08.055 --> 32:09.423
<b>- How is he getting a pass?</b>

32:09.523 --> 32:11.859
<b>Both these guys gave him</b>
<b>technical precision mistakes.</b>

32:11.959 --> 32:13.060
<b>- Pretty good review,</b>
<b>I think, for that.</b>

32:13.160 --> 32:14.628
<b>- What's up, Christian?</b>
<b>- Hey, you know what?</b>

32:14.728 --> 32:16.530
<b>You guys all got</b>
<b>something to say.</b>

32:16.630 --> 32:17.990
<b>At least I got</b>
<b>the balls to say it.</b>

32:18.065 --> 32:20.568
<b>- If you guys want to chime in</b>
<b>after every one, be my guest.</b>

32:20.668 --> 32:23.671
<b>We can do group critique,</b>
<b>if you want to do that after us.</b>

32:27.775 --> 32:29.076
<b>Sarah.</b>

32:29.176 --> 32:33.447
<b>- Your choices on technique</b>
<b>of how to put this black in here</b>

32:33.547 --> 32:34.715
<b> <i>got away from you.</i> </b>

32:34.815 --> 32:36.135
<b> <i>You lost the look</i> </b>
<b> <i>of the character</i> </b>

32:36.217 --> 32:37.852
<b> <i>by him being too dark.</i> </b>

32:37.952 --> 32:39.153
<b>- I've just gotten,</b>
<b>like, really tired</b>

32:39.253 --> 32:41.789
<b>of a lot of the grayscale work</b>
<b>that I do coming back,</b>

32:41.889 --> 32:44.725
<b>and all of the details</b>
<b>that I put in falling out.</b>

32:44.825 --> 32:46.727
<b> <i>So I generally tend to err</i> </b>
<b> <i>on the side</i> </b>

32:46.827 --> 32:47.995
<b> <i>of going a little bit darker.</i> </b>

32:48.095 --> 32:49.864
<b>- A little bit</b>
<b>darker is one thing.</b>

32:49.964 --> 32:52.499
<b>This is a lot darker.</b>
<b>- It's so black.</b>

32:52.600 --> 32:54.635
<b> <i>But then you have</i> </b>
<b> <i>these hyper-critical details</i> </b>

32:54.735 --> 32:55.836
<b> <i>in the creases in the face.</i> </b>

32:55.936 --> 32:57.838
<b> <i>The wrinkles,</i> </b>
<b> <i>even the white highlights</i> </b>

32:57.938 --> 32:59.974
<b>that you put around</b>
<b>the inset of the eye,</b>

33:00.074 --> 33:02.743
<b> <i>that then makes it look more</i> </b>
<b> <i>like a shiny piece of fabric</i> </b>

33:02.843 --> 33:05.779
<b> <i>than it does a soft</i> </b>
<b> <i>facial feature,</i> </b>

33:05.880 --> 33:08.015
<b>to the point where</b>
<b>on a precision challenge,</b>

33:08.115 --> 33:10.117
<b>it is not precise.</b>

33:14.021 --> 33:14.788
<b>- All right, guys, now it's time</b>

33:14.889 --> 33:17.024
<b>to determine a win for today.</b>

33:17.124 --> 33:18.192
<b>- Most of the people in the room</b>

33:18.292 --> 33:19.693
<b>did a great job</b>
<b>capturing the likeness.</b>

33:19.793 --> 33:23.664

33:28.235 --> 33:30.504
<b>And Jesse gave 'em a run</b>
<b>for their money, for sure.</b>

33:30.604 --> 33:31.672
<b>- Christian and Sausage.</b>

33:31.772 --> 33:33.541
<b>That's the fight at hand</b>

33:33.641 --> 33:36.677
<b>The JFK is incredible,</b>

33:38.879 --> 33:39.780
<b> <i>That's pretty amazing.</i> </b>

33:39.880 --> 33:42.183
<b>- Final decision.</b> <b>Ollie?</b>

33:42.283 --> 33:45.719
<b>- Just on precision alone,</b>
<b>Christian.</b>

33:45.819 --> 33:46.854
<b>- I vote for Christian.</b>

33:46.954 --> 33:49.190

33:49.290 --> 33:50.958

33:51.058 --> 33:55.095

34:20.420 --> 34:22.690

34:26.159 --> 34:27.962

<b> <i>compared to this light-skinned</i> </b>

<b>- It's Bill Clinton</b>
<b>with a bad suntan.</b>

35:57.340 --> 35:58.141
<b>- A little bit like Leatherface.</b>

35:58.241 --> 36:00.010

36:03.280 --> 36:06.283
<b>The tattoo is bad.</b>

<b>- I guess I should have</b>
<b>given him a facelift.</b>

38:12.142 --> 38:13.176
<b>- I love the tattoo.</b>

38:13.276 --> 38:14.411
<b>I actually thought</b>
<b>that the Bill Clinton tattoo</b>

38:14.511 --> 38:17.447
<b>was the bottom tattoo,</b>
<b>'cause it was so dark.</b>

38:17.547 --> 38:18.982
<b>- I can't believe</b>
<b>you're even down here, man.</b>

38:19.149 --> 38:20.650
<b>Over burnt face.</b>
<b>It's a great tattoo.</b>

38:20.750 --> 38:23.453
<b>[bleep] the canvas jury.</b>

38:23.553 --> 38:25.555
<b>- Thanks, Kyle.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

38:25.655 --> 38:26.775
<b>- Cleen, as far as capturing</b>

38:26.856 --> 38:28.391
<b>that real personality</b>
<b>of the person,</b>

38:28.491 --> 38:30.627
<b> <i>I can see people saying</i> </b>
<b> <i>that the likeness is off.</i> </b>

38:30.727 --> 38:32.762
<b>- It's 100% Ronald Reagan.</b>

38:32.862 --> 38:34.664
<b> <i>- There are subtle areas</i> </b>
<b> <i>where you aged him,</i> </b>

38:34.764 --> 38:37.334
<b>and it changes the look</b>
<b>of the photo to the portrait.</b>

38:37.434 --> 38:39.736
<b>- Yeah, I might have gotten</b>
<b>a few wrinkles exaggerated,</b>

38:39.836 --> 38:42.239
<b>but I tried not</b>
<b>to make it too dark.</b>

38:42.339 --> 38:43.373
<b>- Of all the tattoos today,</b>
<b>Sarah,</b>

38:43.473 --> 38:45.208
<b>yours is one of the most</b>
<b>disappointing ones.</b>

38:45.308 --> 38:47.744
<b> <i>If you're gonna show</i> </b>
<b> <i>this much dark,</i> </b>

38:47.844 --> 38:49.312
<b> <i>you have to show that much light</i> </b>

38:49.412 --> 38:50.714
<b> <i>so that the contrast works.</i> </b>

38:50.814 --> 38:52.115
<b>- Even if it is dark,</b>

38:52.215 --> 38:53.116
<b>there's a lot</b>
<b>of precise details in this.</b>

38:53.216 --> 38:54.216
<b>- There's no fixing that.</b>

38:54.251 --> 38:56.620
<b>The face is as black</b>
<b>as the jacket.</b>

38:58.121 --> 38:59.321
<b>- I'm surprised I'm down here.</b>

38:59.356 --> 39:00.757
<b>I think I got</b>
<b>one of the disadvantages,</b>

39:00.857 --> 39:01.691
<b>because I have one of the most</b>
<b>unrecognizable</b>

39:01.791 --> 39:04.160
<b>presidents out there.</b>

39:04.261 --> 39:05.861
<b>- I don't think</b>
<b>you're down here wrongly.</b>

39:05.895 --> 39:07.297
<b> <i>It definitely has sections of it</i> </b>

39:07.397 --> 39:08.765
<b> <i>that are just unfinished,</i> </b>
<b> <i>like the top of the hair.</i> </b>

39:08.865 --> 39:11.134
<b> <i>With an artistic eye,</i> </b>

39:11.167 --> 39:13.136
<b>you know that you've got</b>
<b>to finish that part out.</b>

39:14.337 --> 39:15.472
<b>- All right, guys,</b>
<b>it is time to determine</b>

39:15.572 --> 39:17.340
<b>which artist is gonna</b>
<b>be packing their machines.</b>

39:17.440 --> 39:20.510
<b>- For me, if you go</b>
<b>through Sarah's tattoo,</b>

39:20.610 --> 39:22.212
<b>there is a lot</b>
<b>of precise moments.</b>

39:22.312 --> 39:25.282
<b>Arguably even more precise</b>
<b>than Jime's and Cleen's,</b>

39:25.382 --> 39:26.683
<b>but Sarah's is hard to look at.</b>

39:26.783 --> 39:31.054
<b>- When I see Sarah's tattoo,</b>
<b>I got to figure out who that is.</b>

39:31.154 --> 39:32.589
<b>- Clinton sticks</b>
<b>out the most to me.</b>

39:32.689 --> 39:35.191
<b>Today my vote would be</b>
<b>for Sarah to go home.</b>

39:35.292 --> 39:36.526
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:36.626 --> 39:40.697
<b>Sarah, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:43.166 --> 39:44.834
<b>- We all personally</b>
<b>follow your work.</b>

39:44.935 --> 39:46.169
<b>It's amazing.</b>

39:46.202 --> 39:47.404
<b>The stuff you're doing now</b>
<b>is over-the-top.</b>

39:47.504 --> 39:49.472
<b>We were all excited</b>
<b>for you to come in here</b>

39:49.573 --> 39:51.141
<b>and do a lot of great tattoos,</b>

39:51.241 --> 39:53.443
<b>and you just didn't hit</b>
<b>that stride.</b>

39:53.543 --> 39:56.746
<b>- Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>

39:56.846 --> 39:59.883
<b> <i>[somber music]</i> </b>

40:00.684 --> 40:02.852
<b>- I got rattled.</b>

40:02.953 --> 40:05.155
<b> <i>Coming into the competition</i> </b>
<b> <i>halfway through,</i> </b>

40:05.255 --> 40:06.690
<b>I walked right</b>
<b>into a wolves' den.</b>

40:06.790 --> 40:07.691
<b> <i>This competition</i> </b>
<b> <i>is cutthroat in a way</i> </b>

40:07.791 --> 40:10.260
<b> <i>I cannot even describe,</i> </b>

40:10.360 --> 40:11.695
<b>and I let it throw me</b>
<b>off my game.</b>

40:15.865 --> 40:17.200
<b> <i>announcer: On the next episode</b>
<b>of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:17.300 --> 40:18.768
<b>- This competition</b>
<b>is the gauntlet,</b>

40:18.868 --> 40:21.571
<b>mentally and physically.</b>

40:21.671 --> 40:23.139
<b> <i>- My hands are beat.</i> </b>

40:23.206 --> 40:24.241
<b> <i>My fingernails feel</i> </b>
<b> <i>like they're gonna fall off.</i> </b>

40:24.341 --> 40:28.144
<b>- It's time to meet</b>
<b>the last veteran artist.</b>

40:28.245 --> 40:29.646
<b>- Holy crap.</b>
<b>- I'd like to see anybody</b>

40:29.746 --> 40:31.548
<b>who's a real competitor go down</b>
<b>to the bottom at least once.</b>

40:31.648 --> 40:34.284
<b>- I think Anthony's</b>
<b>a pretty strong competitor.</b>

40:34.384 --> 40:36.253
<b>- How the [bleep]</b>
<b>have you had my back?</b>

40:36.353 --> 40:38.355
<b>- I'm a threat, and they're</b>
<b>trying to take me out.</b>

40:38.455 --> 40:40.535
<b>- I dodged a bullet.</b>
<b>- Then you need to do something.</b>

40:40.624 --> 40:41.658
<b>- I'm out for blood right now.</b>

40:41.758 --> 40:43.526
<b>- You definitely show</b>
<b>a lot of struggle.</b>

40:43.627 --> 40:45.395
<b>- Anatomy can never</b>
<b>be an afterthought.</b>

40:45.495 --> 40:47.864
<b>- It looks like a dog scratching</b>
<b>his ass down the sidewalk.</b>

40:47.964 --> 40:49.899
<b>- I wouldn't say that.</b>
<b>- You got to study for the test.</b>

40:50.000 --> 40:51.568
<b>If not, I got to fail you.</b>

40:51.668 --> 40:54.137
<b>- I mean it's confusing</b>
<b>as [bleep] hell.</b>

40:54.237 --> 40:55.237
<b>- You're crazy.</b>

40:56.305 --> 41:02.440
