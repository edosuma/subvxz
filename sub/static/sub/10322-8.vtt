Camden County
was having a heat wave.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.509
Me and Randy wanted
to cool off in the pool.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.544
Unfortunately,
we weren't the only ones.

When do you think the mice
are gonna be done swimmin'?

00:13.147 --> 00:15.716
I think they are done, Randy.
They're just never gettin'
out of the pool.

00:15.749 --> 00:19.187
We can soak our feet
in these, but my manager says...

00:19.220 --> 00:21.589
we gotta put the ice
back in the machines
when we're finished.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.292
I wish we had
air-conditioning.

00:24.325 --> 00:26.327
[ Earl Narrating ]
What Randy said
got me thinkin'...

00:26.360 --> 00:28.729
about someone else who probably
wished he had air-conditioning.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.764
He's number 26 on my list.

00:32.866 --> 00:36.270
A few years back
while Camden was in the middle
of another heat wave,

00:36.304 --> 00:39.240
me and Randy were in the middle
of a crime wave.

00:39.273 --> 00:42.310
Usually, we broke into houses
lookin' for cool stuff.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.346
During the heat wave,
we were happy just to find cool.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.321
would just open up
their doors and share,

00:53.354 --> 00:55.323
we wouldn't have
this stupid heat wave.

Luckily for us,
Woody smoked a lot of weed,

01:12.806 --> 01:15.509
and it never crossed his mind
we were burglars.

01:15.543 --> 01:18.179
He just assumed we were

The right and proper thing
to do...

01:22.916 --> 01:25.119
would have been
to clean him out and move on.

01:25.153 --> 01:27.255
But because of the heat wave,

01:27.288 --> 01:30.291
we decided to rob him

when Woody caught us
rollin' his fridge
through the living room.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.608
But apparently something called
"the munchies" made it hard
for him to concentrate...

I kept havin' to check
to see if I peed myself.

he spent four and a half hours
lookin' for his nose.

The first day, we learned
that being off the grid...

08:12.726 --> 08:15.295
means that stuff
that should be easy
took a lot of work.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.800
First, you search
the woods for fallen branches.
Then you drag them back here,

you debark the wood
for the mulch pile and you chop
the rest to fire up the boiler.

08:23.303 --> 08:26.173
Then, after about three hours,
you got five minutes
of hot water.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.142
And after you take your shower,
you clean the soot
from the boiler,

08:29.176 --> 08:32.212
you put it in the ash pit,
and then we can make soap
out of it later.

is a bucket, Earl.

do some pretty amazing things.

you get vegetables
at every meal,

before I try cleanin' up
the world.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.376
And spendin' five minutes a day
helpin' the Earth--

22:23.410 --> 22:25.445
well, it made me feel better,

22:25.478 --> 22:27.714
even if it did get
my fingers a little sticky.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.094
Plus, once I calmed down,
I think Randy started
feelin' better too.

22:42.128 --> 22:44.831
[ Sighs ]

22:50.670 --> 22:52.672
Hey, Earl.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.574
Yeah, Randy?

22:54.607 --> 22:57.109
Who do you think
would win in a fight--
Muppets or Sesame Street?

22:59.712 --> 23:01.848
I don't really think
they'd fight. They're both
pretty peaceful.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.016
Well, what if they had to?

23:04.050 --> 23:06.519
Like in that
head-choppin'-off movie
where there could be only one.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.621
Muppets.

23:10.657 --> 23:13.593
Okay. What about
Muppets or Fraggles?

23:15.127 --> 23:18.531
- Muppets.
- Okay. What about
Muppets or He-Man?

23:18.565 --> 23:21.734
- Just He-Man,
or He-Man and his friends?
- Just He-Man.

23:21.768 --> 23:24.637
- Muppets.
- That's who I had.

23:25.872 --> 23:28.207
- Good night, Earl.
- Good night, Randy.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.176
Hey, Darnell.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.011
Yeah, Joy?

23:32.044 --> 23:34.981
Who do you think
would win in a fight--
your aunt or my mama?

23:35.014 --> 23:39.752
Well, your mom's a scrapper,
but my aunt's got reach.
I think I'd go with my aunt.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.888
What about your aunt
versus my dad?

23:41.921 --> 23:44.824
Does he have a weapon?
Like a baseball bat
or somethin'?

23:44.857 --> 23:46.793
Just chairs.
But they both have 'em.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.629
Mmm. I'm still gonna have
to go with my aunt.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.164
Even if my cousins
got involved?
Yeah. I assumed...

23:52.198 --> 23:55.201
they would jump in as soon
as my aunt attacked your father
or mother or whatnot.

23:55.234 --> 23:58.938
Your aunt scares me,
Darnell.
Me too.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.040
Maybe we shouldn't do
Thanksgiving this year.

24:01.073 --> 24:03.242
I was thinkin'
the same thing.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.678
Good night, sweetie.
Good night, babe.
