18:16.763 --> 18:19.473
...and forced him to regrow
its organic covering.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.350

named Dr. David Lyman...

18:22.518 --> 18:26.772
...to alter its face to resemble
actor George Laszlo.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.273

Investigation's team in North Hollywood.

it'd be a good idea...

19:41.222 --> 19:43.932
...to give him the capacity
to look for answers himself.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.519
