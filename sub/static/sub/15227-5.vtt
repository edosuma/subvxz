01:14.440 --> 01:16.708
CINDY (on phone):
     Louie, I hit some ice
    and I spun off the road.

01:16.776 --> 01:19.076
I can't get the cab started.

01:19.144 --> 01:21.012
The window's broken
       and I'm freezing.

01:21.079 --> 01:23.548
I'm on an unmarked country road.

01:23.616 --> 01:26.418
She's doomed.

01:26.486 --> 01:29.921
Louie, I know
      where this woman is.

01:29.989 --> 01:31.623
It's right near the farm

01:31.691 --> 01:34.993
where Simka and I
buy our goat knuckles.

01:35.060 --> 01:36.327
Oh, oh, oh...

01:36.395 --> 01:39.131
Well, maybe you can do
        something with this cab.

01:39.198 --> 01:41.465
I'll, I'll take a look.

01:41.533 --> 01:44.002
(starter cranking,
        engine stalling)

01:46.272 --> 01:49.006
Oh, I think I know
what the problem is.

01:49.074 --> 01:50.141
What?

01:50.209 --> 01:51.943
Winter.

01:52.011 --> 01:54.412
(wind howling)

01:54.479 --> 01:57.515
It's a very simple
                  choice, Latka.

01:57.583 --> 01:59.885
Either you have sex with me
         or you freeze to death.

01:59.952 --> 02:03.587
Sex. Death.

02:03.655 --> 02:05.756
Sex. Death.

02:05.824 --> 02:07.759
Hmm.

02:10.961 --> 02:14.633
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

02:14.700 --> 02:18.603
It-it happened when Cindy and I
were waiting to be rescued.

02:18.670 --> 02:19.771
Yeah?

02:19.839 --> 02:20.972
This will destroy Simka.

02:21.039 --> 02:22.640
I don't know.
What should I do?

02:22.708 --> 02:24.709
Well, uh...

02:24.777 --> 02:26.444
You're not going to
              tell her, are you?

02:26.512 --> 02:28.346
I have to.

02:28.413 --> 02:30.315
She knows me so well,
she will know. Believe me.

02:30.382 --> 02:31.550
No, no, no, no, Latka.

02:31.617 --> 02:34.118
You can't hurt her
         just so you should feel

02:34.186 --> 02:36.287
a little less guilty. I mean,
        th-the bigger thing here

02:36.355 --> 02:37.722
is to, is to spare Simka.

02:37.790 --> 02:39.557
Yes. That's right.

02:39.625 --> 02:43.328
The only decent thing
to do is to deceive her.

02:43.395 --> 02:44.563
Whew!

02:46.565 --> 02:48.165
(door opening)

02:48.233 --> 02:50.635
Hi, honey. I'm home.

02:50.703 --> 02:53.305
Latka, I am so happy, I...

02:53.372 --> 02:56.641
You did it with
                  another woman!

02:59.045 --> 03:01.512
I'm sorry I hurt you.

03:01.580 --> 03:03.514
We must go to the priest.

03:03.582 --> 03:06.017
You must confess your sin.

03:06.085 --> 03:10.988
And whatever he advises,
                   we must obey.

03:11.056 --> 03:15.660
And so, Simka, <i>nik-nik,</i>

03:15.728 --> 03:17.529
<i>Latka lavorshney.</i>

03:17.597 --> 03:21.532
So, Simka must sin
with someone Latka works with.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.168
You mean to tell me,

03:23.236 --> 03:25.770
you're going to sleep
    with one of my friends?

03:31.877 --> 03:34.678
Baby, you're the greatest.

04:10.248 --> 04:12.316
Look how you can sleep.

04:13.685 --> 04:17.454
My little fool who has
brought us to the brink of ruin.

04:19.125 --> 04:23.160
What kind of dreams
can you have

04:23.228 --> 04:27.598
while I stand here suffering,
      the innocent victim?

04:29.134 --> 04:30.868
What kind of slumber
        is this that...

04:30.936 --> 04:33.004
Don't worry. I am awake.

04:38.944 --> 04:40.879
Simka.

04:45.151 --> 04:48.620
Simka, which one
of my dear friends

04:48.688 --> 04:50.054
are you going
to sleep with?

04:52.424 --> 04:53.925
I can't pick. You pick.

04:53.993 --> 04:55.827
No, you pick.

04:55.894 --> 04:57.796
I can't pick.

04:57.863 --> 05:02.067
I can't pick.
      What does it matter?

05:02.134 --> 05:04.268
It's all a disgrace.

05:04.336 --> 05:06.103
All right.

05:06.171 --> 05:07.405
I will pick.

05:07.473 --> 05:10.508
Okay.

05:10.576 --> 05:12.210
But if it's Louie,

05:12.277 --> 05:15.246
will you still love me
    when I've lost my mind?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.721
All right, maybe not Louie.

05:23.789 --> 05:26.256
Uh... how about Tony?

05:26.324 --> 05:28.459
Fine.

05:28.527 --> 05:31.129
Tony.

05:31.197 --> 05:35.799
I must debase myself
with someone with arms of steel.

05:37.703 --> 05:40.872
I don't think
   Tony is such a good idea.

05:43.508 --> 05:46.411
I-I don't know
          who is a good idea.

05:46.479 --> 05:49.380
Alex is nice.

05:49.448 --> 05:51.983
Not so nice.
     He's a stranger to me.

05:52.050 --> 05:54.719
Well, then you can look
at this as a chance

05:54.786 --> 05:56.721
to get to know him better.

05:59.291 --> 06:04.395
Latka, it is impossible
       for either of us to pick.

06:04.463 --> 06:08.366
We will let the fates decide.

06:08.434 --> 06:12.303
We will pick as we would
      in the old country.

06:12.371 --> 06:14.672
We'll have a dinner party,

06:14.739 --> 06:16.440
invite everyone,

06:16.508 --> 06:22.079
and whoever is the last man to
    enter, that will be the one.

06:22.147 --> 06:24.415
Oh...

06:24.483 --> 06:27.785
You mean the way
    we elect our president?

06:27.852 --> 06:31.589
Exactly.

06:34.527 --> 06:37.495
(Louie groaning
    and shivering)

06:37.563 --> 06:39.263
(sighs)

06:39.331 --> 06:40.764
(Louie sighs)

06:40.832 --> 06:43.935
How would you like to warm me,
my little Arctic fox?

06:44.003 --> 06:46.537
Louie, leave me alone.

06:46.605 --> 06:49.073
Oh, Nardo,
     you're a lucky woman.

06:49.141 --> 06:50.474
Why?

06:50.542 --> 06:53.044
Because you're a cab driver,
    and there's a blizzard.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.211
I love it.

06:54.279 --> 06:58.516
Ah, kicking up those
              sheets of slush...

06:58.584 --> 07:00.118
"Watch out, Grandma."

07:00.185 --> 07:02.820
(imitates slush spraying)

07:02.887 --> 07:06.257
Ah, I wish I was going out
      with all my cabbies.

07:06.325 --> 07:08.759
With Nardo and Banta

07:08.827 --> 07:11.896
and Dancer and Prancer...

07:11.964 --> 07:15.799
Oh, excuse me.
      I'm a little giddy.

07:27.446 --> 07:31.582
Alex, Tony, Jim, Louie,

07:31.650 --> 07:33.417
could you please come over here?

07:33.485 --> 07:35.753
Why don't you
come over here?

07:35.821 --> 07:37.655
Oh, good idea.

07:43.429 --> 07:45.729
Good news, everybody.

07:45.797 --> 07:48.633
You're all invited
          to my house

07:48.701 --> 07:50.201
for a party
    at the end of the shift.

07:50.268 --> 07:52.036
Sorry, Latka. I can't come.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.671
I'm working, you know,
    a double shift tonight.

07:53.738 --> 07:56.508
But that's okay, Elaine.
       It's not for you.

07:56.575 --> 07:58.176
Oh.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.978
It's going to be
 a very special party.

08:01.046 --> 08:04.481
It's going to be
   a wonderful party.

08:05.851 --> 08:09.287
It's going to be the best party
       you ever been to.

08:10.689 --> 08:13.024
(voice cracking):
            Dress...

08:13.092 --> 08:15.259
is informal.

08:15.326 --> 08:17.228
You all know the address.

08:17.296 --> 08:20.164
(sobbing)

08:20.232 --> 08:24.001
I'm looking forward
    to seeing you all there.

08:26.105 --> 08:29.106
(sobbing)

08:29.174 --> 08:31.041
Are you guys going to go?

08:31.109 --> 08:32.610
Why not?

08:32.677 --> 08:36.547
I could use a good time.

08:38.984 --> 08:42.019
LATKA:
    Maybe no one will come,
  and then the priest will say

08:42.087 --> 08:43.486
that you don't have
    to go through with this.

08:43.554 --> 08:48.226
Yes, I still believe a
   miracle like that can happen.

08:48.293 --> 08:50.295
(knocking at door)

08:50.362 --> 08:54.498
Don't get my
               hopes up no more.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.934
Listen, there is nothing
to worry about.

09:00.004 --> 09:02.540
The only one to count
      is the last one in.

09:02.607 --> 09:04.976
This one is out of the running.

09:05.044 --> 09:07.344
Please be Louie.
        Please be Louie.

09:07.412 --> 09:08.646
Please be Louie.
                Please be Louie.

09:08.714 --> 09:09.847
Louie!

09:09.915 --> 09:11.415
Hey!

09:11.483 --> 09:13.116
Hey! Hey, Latka.

09:13.184 --> 09:15.386
Good to see you.
Come in, come in.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.788
Uh, look,
       I'm double-parked.

09:17.856 --> 09:19.657
I just stopped up to tell you

09:19.725 --> 09:22.993
that I'll be right back
as soon as I find a space, okay?

09:23.061 --> 09:24.095
Hey, Tone.

09:24.162 --> 09:25.430
Hey. What do you say, Lou?

09:25.497 --> 09:27.699
Oh, the one, the good-looking
one with the chest of granite

09:27.766 --> 09:28.766
is early, honey.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.169
Hey. Hey, Latka.
       How are you doing?

09:41.279 --> 09:42.547
So, how's it going?

09:42.614 --> 09:44.082
Shh.

10:03.268 --> 10:04.368
Thanks for coming.

10:04.436 --> 10:05.536
Thanks for having me.

10:05.603 --> 10:07.038
Shh!

10:07.105 --> 10:08.172
(knocking at door)

10:08.240 --> 10:11.175
SIMKA: Ooh,
             I can't stand it.

10:11.242 --> 10:12.542
LATKA:
         Maybe it will
           be Louie,

10:12.610 --> 10:15.680
and then you don't have
 to worry about it being Louie.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.682
Hey, can I ask
                     a question?

10:17.749 --> 10:19.684
You got any pretzels?

10:21.653 --> 10:23.587
(knocking at door)

10:32.765 --> 10:35.499
I hope the boss isn't too mad.

10:35.567 --> 10:39.036
I just beat him
    out of a parking space.

10:45.010 --> 10:46.677
Hey, how's it going?

10:46.745 --> 10:48.679
Shh!

10:51.649 --> 10:54.385
I sure like dinner parties.

10:54.453 --> 10:58.222
It's one of the
              few real occasions

10:58.290 --> 11:00.558
you get to be formal
                and ill at ease.

11:03.261 --> 11:05.462
SIMKA:
        It's either Alex
           or Louie.

11:05.530 --> 11:09.800
Whoever it's not,
                     is the one.

11:09.868 --> 11:11.269
(knocking)

11:21.312 --> 11:22.647
Hi.

11:24.449 --> 11:26.917
Hi, there.

11:26.985 --> 11:29.453
It's Louie.

11:29.521 --> 11:31.989
Hi, Louie.

11:32.057 --> 11:34.558
Come on. Get out
                     of the way.
What are you
pushing for?

11:34.626 --> 11:36.126
You want to go ahead
of me, go ahead.

11:36.194 --> 11:37.127
What are you gonna do,

11:37.195 --> 11:38.262
stand in the door
                  like a statue?

11:38.329 --> 11:39.564
I don't like to be pushed,
that's all.

11:39.631 --> 11:40.564
Well, get out
               of the way, then!

11:40.632 --> 11:41.865
Okay, you want
to go ahead, go ahead.

11:41.933 --> 11:43.500
You took my parking.
                Somebody took my
                  parking space!

11:43.568 --> 11:44.835
You want to go in,
go in.

11:44.903 --> 11:46.971
LOUIE:
Well, go on in, then!

11:47.039 --> 11:47.971
Look, go ahead.

11:48.039 --> 11:49.306
All right, I'll go in.

11:57.515 --> 12:00.317
It's Alex.

12:00.385 --> 12:03.287
That's what I thought, too,
      but apparently it's Louie.

12:05.791 --> 12:08.192
ALEX:
Nice to see you, Simka.

12:08.259 --> 12:09.426
(groans)

12:12.998 --> 12:15.065
I am sure you
             all understand

12:15.133 --> 12:16.600
that in light
         of the circumstances,

12:16.668 --> 12:19.236
Simka and I would
           like to be alone.

12:19.304 --> 12:22.873
Alex... we will get
        in touch with you later.

12:22.941 --> 12:24.142
Thank you all
              for coming.

12:24.209 --> 12:25.609
That's it?

12:25.677 --> 12:27.478
Yes. Good night.

12:32.183 --> 12:35.585
They sure make
         entertaining seem easy.

12:44.596 --> 12:45.696
Hi, Elaine.

12:45.763 --> 12:47.564
Simka, hi.

12:47.632 --> 12:50.434
Hi. I was hoping
              you would be here.

12:50.502 --> 12:51.669
I was hoping
                  I'd catch you.

12:51.736 --> 12:53.804
Oh, well, great.
                    Yeah.

12:53.872 --> 12:55.039
I was just, uh,

12:55.106 --> 12:58.809
on my way to visit
        a friend of my husband's

12:58.877 --> 13:00.178
for a certain purpose,

13:00.245 --> 13:02.579
and I thought maybe
      I would walk a little more

13:02.647 --> 13:04.848
and see if you were
             here. Here you are.

13:04.916 --> 13:06.650
Oh, good!

13:06.718 --> 13:08.018
Thank goodness.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.353
Uh... what's up?

13:09.420 --> 13:12.390
Oh, nothing's up.
     I just thought we'd chat.

13:12.457 --> 13:14.625
Oh. So, there's nothing wrong?

13:14.693 --> 13:16.993
Oh, everything's fine.

13:17.061 --> 13:19.730
I just thought we'd jaw some.

13:19.798 --> 13:21.265
Oh, good.
Come on. Sit down.

13:21.332 --> 13:22.499
Okay.

13:22.567 --> 13:28.038
Oh, so, uh... so what do
         you want to talk about?

13:28.106 --> 13:33.444
Well... just one girl
to another, Elaine--

13:33.512 --> 13:34.545
are you religious?

13:34.613 --> 13:38.482
Oh, well, um...

13:38.550 --> 13:40.952
well, yeah, in a way.

13:41.019 --> 13:45.522
My parents are very
              religious, so I...

13:45.590 --> 13:48.025
Why is that such
a tricky question?

13:48.093 --> 13:49.193
I don't know.

13:49.261 --> 13:53.864
Now you ask me if I'm religious.

13:53.932 --> 13:55.666
Are you religious, Simka?

13:55.734 --> 13:58.435
For sure.

13:58.503 --> 14:04.375
If you were religious,
and you believed in the beauty

14:04.443 --> 14:08.746
and the spiritual nature
of your faith...

14:08.813 --> 14:13.283
but then your spiritual advisor
told you to do something

14:13.351 --> 14:17.121
that would just make
your flesh crawl,

14:17.188 --> 14:18.622
what would you do?

14:18.690 --> 14:23.127
I'd get another
              spiritual advisor.

14:23.195 --> 14:27.631
American girls--
that is the stuff.

14:27.698 --> 14:30.300
"Watch out, baby,
here we come!"

14:30.368 --> 14:33.570
It's not so simple for me.

14:36.774 --> 14:39.042
Let's just talk about men.

14:39.110 --> 14:41.812
Something less
                  tricky, right?
                      (chuckles)

14:41.880 --> 14:47.451
For instance, what is Tony like?

14:47.519 --> 14:49.420
Oh, Tony, he's the best.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.155
What's Alex like?!

14:51.223 --> 14:53.457
Why are you shouting?

14:53.524 --> 14:55.258
I'm not shouting.

14:55.326 --> 14:58.596
Yes, you are; you said,
            "What's Alex like?!"

15:00.865 --> 15:02.799
Is he a nice guy?

15:02.867 --> 15:04.935
Why don't you just tell me
     what you want to know?

15:05.002 --> 15:07.638
I was wondering...

15:07.706 --> 15:09.773
about you and Alex.

15:09.841 --> 15:11.208
Did you?

15:14.846 --> 15:17.481
Um...

15:17.549 --> 15:18.649
(chuckles)

15:18.717 --> 15:19.950
Ooh... um...

15:20.018 --> 15:21.051
(laughs)

15:21.119 --> 15:24.121
Simka, to tell you the truth,

15:24.189 --> 15:26.524
I'd say "no" no matter
      what the truth was.

15:26.591 --> 15:31.528
Thank you for leveling with me,
            Elaine.

15:31.596 --> 15:34.531
Simka...

15:34.599 --> 15:36.600
what is going on?

15:36.667 --> 15:41.272
Nothing.
It does not make any difference.

15:41.339 --> 15:45.142
Whatever I do, my life will be
miserable for as long as I live,

15:45.210 --> 15:48.278
if I'm unlucky enough
         to live long.

15:48.346 --> 15:51.615
And what is this wretched curse
       that contaminates

15:51.683 --> 15:54.218
my one life on the Earth?!

15:54.286 --> 15:55.886
Simka, what's going on?

15:55.954 --> 16:00.590
Nothing.
  It's just girl talk, Elaine.

16:02.627 --> 16:04.962
I'm going
to be going now.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.598
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
            Where are you going?

16:07.665 --> 16:11.035
I don't know, to the movies
or to the gallows, maybe.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.704
But I tell you something,
            Elaine,

16:13.771 --> 16:15.873
we must do this more often.

16:17.441 --> 16:18.809
Bye.

16:21.446 --> 16:23.213
Bye.

16:28.553 --> 16:29.486
(knocking)

16:32.156 --> 16:33.157
Oh, Simka, hello.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.591
What are you doing here?

16:34.659 --> 16:39.029
Well, you see, because Latka
    has had sex with someone

16:39.097 --> 16:40.564
he works with, our priest

16:40.632 --> 16:42.767
has said that I also
                   must have sex

16:42.834 --> 16:44.301
with someone
                  he works with,

16:44.369 --> 16:46.203
if we wish to
                 remain married.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.806
And we decided that the last man

16:48.873 --> 16:51.842
to enter the dinner party
       would be the one.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.544
And as you know, you were tardy.

16:57.849 --> 16:59.783
May I come in?

17:02.387 --> 17:04.888
Yeah. I-I don't think
I understand any of this,

17:04.955 --> 17:06.223
but come in.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.858
I suppose you want to have
someone to talk to, right?

17:08.926 --> 17:10.394
Talk is cheap.

17:10.462 --> 17:11.795
I want your body.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.134
(chuckles)

17:17.201 --> 17:18.769
You're not serious,
are you?

17:18.836 --> 17:20.137
It won't take long.

17:20.204 --> 17:22.806
I know you have
             to go to work soon.

17:22.874 --> 17:26.041
I just want to have sex with
 you, and then I'll run along.

17:26.109 --> 17:27.511
No, no, no, Simka.
Stop this.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.946
Stop, stop it
right now, stop it!

17:29.013 --> 17:32.282
Alex, if you do not help us,

17:32.350 --> 17:34.685
Latka and I must circle
        each other once

17:34.753 --> 17:36.620
and complete
  the ancient divorce ritual.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.756
And I will do
                anything to keep
            that from happening.

17:39.824 --> 17:43.226
See?
  Smooth, milky white-- yours.

17:43.294 --> 17:45.061
No, no, Simka, Simka!

17:46.631 --> 17:47.965
That's barbaric, you know that?

17:48.033 --> 17:50.534
Are you telling me that
   in that religion of yours,

17:50.601 --> 17:52.335
that, uh, two wrongs
     actually make a right?

17:52.403 --> 17:56.306
"In that religion of yours"?

17:56.374 --> 17:57.841
Do you mock us?

17:57.909 --> 18:01.544
Do I mock you
                  because you do
                 not eat animals

18:01.612 --> 18:04.648
with cloven hooves unless
        they chew their cud? No!

18:04.716 --> 18:07.651
Your people knew
          that it was unhealthy.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.086
Please, Simka...

18:09.153 --> 18:12.123
And our people know
            that you cannot have
                  intimacy again

18:12.190 --> 18:13.624
without knowing
          the pain of infidelity

18:13.691 --> 18:15.960
that the other one
                   went through.

18:16.027 --> 18:18.295
Ours, like yours, is
            a profound tradition

18:18.362 --> 18:21.465
of tolerance,
                     brotherhood
                      and faith!

18:21.533 --> 18:25.269
Now, peel me like a grape
       so I can get out of here.

18:29.407 --> 18:32.776
You can't actually
tell me

18:32.844 --> 18:34.478
that cheating
on Latka is gonna do

18:34.546 --> 18:37.648
anything but make
things worse.

18:37.716 --> 18:42.686
It is not bad enough
              I have to be here,

18:42.753 --> 18:45.155
now you're playing
                    hard to get?

18:47.559 --> 18:49.626
You want to be seduced?

18:49.693 --> 18:51.428
Okay.

18:51.496 --> 18:54.965
Oh... I never felt
               like this before!

18:55.033 --> 18:57.234
My legs are like
                      jelly, oh!

18:57.301 --> 19:00.337
You make me feel
             like a little girl!

19:00.405 --> 19:02.406
You make me feel
                   like a woman!

19:02.473 --> 19:04.908
You make me feel
            like a flying horse!

19:04.976 --> 19:07.911
What do you want?!
              What do you want?!

19:07.979 --> 19:09.680
Sanity. Sanity.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.649
Just one moment
of sanity, that's all.

19:11.716 --> 19:13.917
Sanity.

19:18.222 --> 19:22.859
Alex... please,

19:22.927 --> 19:25.495
you have to help me.

19:25.563 --> 19:31.234
Otherwise, Latka and I will
 really have to get a divorce.

19:31.302 --> 19:33.971
Simka, I am <i>not</i> going
      to make love to you.

19:50.221 --> 19:51.721
I'm sorry.

19:54.459 --> 19:56.360
I'm gonna take you home.

20:03.468 --> 20:07.071
Listen, it's, uh...
it's cold.

20:07.138 --> 20:09.273
Better button up.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.513
Okay.

20:28.993 --> 20:31.228
Oh, I'm glad
               to see you, Alex.

20:31.296 --> 20:35.965
I stayed with Latka
        because apparently he...

20:36.033 --> 20:37.167
he has some trouble,

20:37.235 --> 20:42.339
and I only wish
I could follow it.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.807
It seems...

20:43.875 --> 20:46.743
No, Jim, Jim, Jim,
           don't worry about it.

20:46.810 --> 20:48.145
Everything is
                  all right now.

20:48.213 --> 20:50.480
Alex, Simka and I are
           both grateful to you.

20:50.548 --> 20:52.248
Now get out of my
               sight, you swine.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.689
I have bad news
      for you, my darling.

20:59.757 --> 21:02.492
I have been
        faithful to you.

21:02.560 --> 21:06.129
Oh, no!

21:06.197 --> 21:12.002
Now this is where
        I get confused.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.770
If I can get over this part,

21:13.838 --> 21:15.572
I know I can help him.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.107
Yeah, Jim, just hold it.

21:20.845 --> 21:23.714
So we must part now forever,
          my beloved.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.715
Latka! Latka, you're not going

21:25.783 --> 21:27.618
to go through with this,
            are you?

21:27.686 --> 21:31.721
Alex, we must.
      It is the only way.

21:31.789 --> 21:34.992
Are you ready
         to complete the circle?

21:35.060 --> 21:39.863
I must take one last look
       at you as my wife.

21:39.931 --> 21:44.168
Simka,
 you will always have my heart.

21:44.235 --> 21:46.102
I don't need it without you.

21:48.806 --> 21:50.407
I will miss you.

21:50.474 --> 21:54.678
I will miss your touch.

21:54.746 --> 22:00.851
I will miss the children
     we could have had together.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.919
Good-bye, Latka.

22:35.319 --> 22:37.621
Are they unhappy...

22:39.858 --> 22:41.792
...b-because
they got divorced?

22:41.860 --> 22:43.793
Yeah.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.897
Why don't they just
get married again?

22:47.965 --> 22:49.899
It's not that
                    simple, Jim.

22:49.967 --> 22:51.902
You think they'd go
       through this kind of hell

22:51.969 --> 22:54.037
if they could
               just marry again?

22:59.543 --> 23:02.545
We must seek the
      Reverend Gorky right away!

23:02.613 --> 23:04.380
Jim, thank you!

23:04.448 --> 23:05.716
Mwa!

23:05.784 --> 23:07.885
Thank you very much.

23:07.952 --> 23:10.386
Let's try to make it work
this time.

23:17.761 --> 23:19.329
Piece of cake.

23:26.904 --> 23:30.807
(theme song playing)

23:53.898 --> 23:55.498
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:55.566 --> 23:56.766
