00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

01:40.267 --> 01:42.394
Open wide, Brooke.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.026
Wider.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.491
Brooke: You know
I don't want you anymore.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.709
( Laughing )

02:29.066 --> 02:31.401
I, I didn't do that...

02:34.571 --> 02:35.739
A stranger...

02:41.954 --> 02:44.748
A stranger, Doctor?

02:44.790 --> 02:49.169
I can remember those
awful things I did,

02:49.211 --> 02:51.880
but for the life of me...
Doctor...

02:51.922 --> 02:55.968
I don't know the man
who did them.

02:57.427 --> 03:01.557
This stranger,
this evil Dr. Feinstone,

03:01.598 --> 03:03.183
where is he now?

03:03.225 --> 03:08.313
Gone, consumed by the...

03:08.355 --> 03:10.232
rage that spawned him.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.359
By that, you mean it's over,

03:12.401 --> 03:15.404
you put your anger and
your wife's infidelity behind you?

03:34.965 --> 03:39.803
No Dr., it is not over.
It will never be over.

03:39.803 --> 03:43.140
Every second of every day...

03:43.140 --> 03:48.604
asleep or awake, I see her face.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.940
The faces of all of my victims.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.320
You refer to them as
''your victims'',

03:56.361 --> 03:59.615
even though you say you don't know
the stranger who hurt them.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.581
He is me.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.127
I am him.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.719
Still he remains...

04:24.431 --> 04:26.850
until love returns the soft...

04:28.393 --> 04:30.312
whisper of his voice...

04:32.189 --> 04:34.566
searching...

04:34.608 --> 04:36.193
wanting...

04:37.236 --> 04:39.196
that which he hath given...

04:41.031 --> 04:43.116
with no reply.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.793
And he is gone?

04:55.003 --> 04:58.882
He is under control.
Shall we go?

05:00.008 --> 05:03.220
Radio: Dr. Alan Feinstone,
the notorious psycho dentist,

05:03.220 --> 05:07.057
broke out of the state mental facility
at Indio yesterday afternoon.

05:07.099 --> 05:10.394
His hostage,
Psychiatrist Dr. Genevieve Cussler--

05:13.397 --> 05:15.524
( Opera plays )

06:05.949 --> 06:07.951
Man: So, you think
before the Doc went postal

06:07.951 --> 06:11.914
he was socking money
away from you and the IRS?

06:11.955 --> 06:15.709
And from you, his devoted
wife and help mate.

06:15.751 --> 06:19.379
Excuse my bad manners,
but did he do that to you?

06:19.421 --> 06:21.840
Cut your tongue out?

06:26.803 --> 06:28.555
What a world, huh?

06:32.518 --> 06:34.603
These are all his, huh?

06:34.645 --> 06:38.273
Souvenirs from a trip
he took as a kid.

06:41.860 --> 06:43.403
South Dakota.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.532
Nebraska.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.452
Missouri.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.916
Jeeze, look at these
snow domes...

06:55.958 --> 06:59.545
Oh, a set of
safety deposit box keys.

07:03.215 --> 07:06.218
The answer's in
the postcards, huh?

07:07.511 --> 07:09.221
All right.

07:16.895 --> 07:20.482
They found the shrink's car
abandoned in Flagstaff.

07:20.524 --> 07:23.527
Along with 7OO or so bucks
from her wallet.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.362
Jeeze, he could be
just about anywhere.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.927
- Bye, now.
- Thank you.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.501
Mr. Wilkes?

08:27.633 --> 08:30.469
Well, I'll be--
Larry Caine, come on in.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.347
How long has it been,
five years?

08:33.388 --> 08:35.349
It's good to see you.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.226
Well, to what do we owe
this great pleasure?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.102
Rush hour traffic.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.688
Does that come with
an explanation?

08:45.567 --> 08:48.278
Well, my car overheated
on the Alexandria bridge...

08:48.320 --> 08:50.614
It was the morning rush hour,
that was it.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.617
I couldn't face another
jawing mouth, another bicuspid,

08:53.617 --> 08:57.454
I was weary of my life,
the city,

08:57.496 --> 09:02.042
the moral decay that passes
as sophistication.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.671
Felt like that myself some days.

09:07.506 --> 09:09.675
So, I left my car
right there on the bridge...

09:09.716 --> 09:12.427
I walked home, I called my lawyer...

09:12.469 --> 09:14.388
and a long story short,
here I am.

09:14.429 --> 09:17.975
Small town, honest people,
clean living.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.103
But, I've got me a little
problem, ol' buddy...

09:22.855 --> 09:25.482
( Intercom buzzes )
Yeah, Jeremy?

09:25.524 --> 09:28.110
Bev, see if you can get
Harry and his drill over here.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.612
Dr. Caine has lost the key
to his safety deposit box.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.406
All righty.

09:32.447 --> 09:35.075
It's a little irregular,
but here it is.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.035
Thanks.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.830
So, what are your plans, Larry?

09:39.872 --> 09:43.500
Oh, to live in Paradise.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.961
Great golf just outside of town.

09:46.003 --> 09:48.130
I detest golf.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.633
We'll change that.
Where are you staying?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.468
The Paradise Motel.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.304
The hell you are.

10:01.602 --> 10:03.520
( Sinister chuckle )

10:05.230 --> 10:06.565
Ahh, yes.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.820
Jamie, have you rented the cottage?

10:11.862 --> 10:13.488
No, not yet.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.365
There's someone I want you
to meet. Come with me.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.542
Larry?

10:25.584 --> 10:27.794
Yeah, I'll be right with you.

10:29.254 --> 10:32.382
Jamie Devers...
Dr. Lawrence Caine.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.510
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

10:34.551 --> 10:39.681
Yes, Jeremy tells me that
you're his favorite niece.

10:39.723 --> 10:42.351
I'm his only niece.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.271
Larry has just moved
here to Paradise,

10:46.313 --> 10:48.357
lock, stock and barrel,

10:48.398 --> 10:51.443
from that eastern den
of iniquity, Washington, D.C.

10:51.485 --> 10:56.240
Actually I left the lock,
stock and barrel behind.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.034
You've got the empty cottage.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.411
I thought maybe you could
show it to Larry during lunch.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.330
Uh, it's really small.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.457
Well, it's just me.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.336
This was my parents' house.

11:10.587 --> 11:14.842
It's where I grew up.
And there's the cottage.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.139
I'll take it.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.151
No. No.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.737
You having trouble sleeping, Doc?

11:42.703 --> 11:44.955
I sure would if I were you.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.959
Go away! Go away!

11:49.001 --> 11:52.337
When it comes right down to it,
Caine is just a Feinstone.

11:52.379 --> 11:55.799
And we all know what
a Feinstone is, don't we?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.526
Do it, do it.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.614
( Sighing with pleasure )

12:19.948 --> 12:22.034
Yes, bleed.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.954
( Knock at door )
Hello?

12:28.373 --> 12:29.917
Larry?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.426
Larry?

13:05.035 --> 13:08.497
( Distorted )
I came running over here.
I was worried.

13:08.539 --> 13:11.792
( Normal voice ) I came running
over because I heard this loud noise.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.336
I didn't know what to think.

13:14.378 --> 13:16.713
I'm in unfamiliar
surroundings and...

13:16.755 --> 13:22.094
I must have bumped into the dresser
on my way to the bathroom....

13:22.135 --> 13:23.929
I can replace it.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.932
Don't worry about it.
I can make another one.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.518
- You made it?
- Yeah.

13:29.560 --> 13:31.478
Here, let me do that.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.564
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

13:35.399 --> 13:39.403
A little housework
always relaxes me.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.864
Do you do windows?

13:42.406 --> 13:44.241
As a matter of fact, I do.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.953
Good, I think we're going
to get along just fine then.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.373
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:54.710 --> 13:59.089
In town, I think it's called
the ''Paradise Cafe''...

13:59.089 --> 14:00.924
is it any good?

14:02.968 --> 14:05.554
After graduate school in Seattle,

14:05.596 --> 14:09.266
and a few lost years
contemplating the meaning of art,

14:09.308 --> 14:12.936
in a world that was
consumed by commercialism...

14:12.978 --> 14:16.648
I came to the realization that
actually creating my pottery

14:16.690 --> 14:19.568
was more important
than thinking about it.

14:19.610 --> 14:24.281
And so, here I am
back in Paradise,

14:24.323 --> 14:28.660
bank teller by day,
artist by night.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.539
Chicken fried steak
for the gentleman,

14:32.581 --> 14:34.833
spinach salad for Jamie.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.961
No wonder you stay so thin, darling.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.255
Anything else?

14:47.054 --> 14:49.181
Something wrong, sir?

14:50.641 --> 14:56.313
No, no, I was just contemplating
a side of curly fries...

14:56.355 --> 15:00.692
but I decided against it,
thank you.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.905
Well, enjoy your dinner, folks.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.615
Thanks.

15:06.657 --> 15:12.037
So, you're fleeing reality
in search of a dream,

15:12.079 --> 15:15.499
and I'm fleeing a dream
in search of reality.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.961
What dream are you fleeing from?

15:19.002 --> 15:22.631
My wife was a former
Miss Maryland,

15:22.673 --> 15:29.721
thus we were the perfect couple
for the perfect dinner party.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.641
You fled from that?

15:32.683 --> 15:35.227
Did I mention the former
Miss Maryland

15:35.269 --> 15:37.980
was attending parties
without me in the afternoons

15:38.021 --> 15:41.984
thrown by younger male members
of the foreign diplomatic corp.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.489
Yet, still he remains...

15:47.531 --> 15:53.162
until love returns the soft
whisper of his voice.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.873
Wanting, searching...

15:55.914 --> 15:59.877
that which he has given
without return.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.090
To Paradise.

16:05.132 --> 16:11.555
May we, um... both find here
what we're looking for.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.573
Larry, you okay?

16:30.449 --> 16:31.867
Larry, what's wrong?

16:41.877 --> 16:43.670
I lost a cap.

17:16.912 --> 17:19.289
One of my caps has come loose.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.415
We didn't put that in.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.920
Yes, I know, I'd like the doctor
to re-cement it, please.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.927
Fill this out.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.284
( Phone rings )

18:10.000 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:26.523 --> 18:29.359
( Sound of heart beating )

18:31.111 --> 18:33.363
( Inner voice )
Don't do it.

18:33.405 --> 18:36.658
Don't... don't do it.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.123
Oh, God.

18:50.714 --> 18:52.049
Oh, that's good.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.596
Send in the next patient, please.

18:57.638 --> 18:59.473
Please have a seat.

18:59.515 --> 19:02.142
This won't hurt a bit.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.395
Have you been drilled on before?
Would you like some gas?

19:07.564 --> 19:10.817
Open wide, wider...

19:14.154 --> 19:19.576
You have to stop moving.
If you move, I cannot proceed.

19:19.576 --> 19:22.579
Why are you moving?
Why is everything moving?

19:22.621 --> 19:28.126
Please, sit down. Don't move.
You've got to sit still.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.720
( Phone ringing )

19:41.098 --> 19:43.267
Woman answers:
Doctor's office.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.644
Hello, Mrs. Anderson.
Appointment for when...

20:22.973 --> 20:24.933
Hey!

20:24.975 --> 20:28.103
What are you doing
with my patient?

20:28.145 --> 20:32.232
Remove this cotton from your
mouth ma'am, so you don't choke.

20:33.192 --> 20:35.694
What's going on here, what... ?

20:41.700 --> 20:43.785
Relax a minute, dear, while I...

20:49.958 --> 20:52.711
Bernice, look after Edna there.

20:54.171 --> 20:56.131
Who the hell do you think you are?

20:56.173 --> 20:59.051
That woman was in
respiratory distress.

20:59.092 --> 21:01.261
Respiratory distress?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.472
So, you're a doctor, that it?

21:03.514 --> 21:07.893
Traveling the country saving poor
souls from respiratory distress?

21:07.935 --> 21:09.645
I am a dentist.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.688
Then you should know better
than to be poking around

21:11.730 --> 21:14.066
in another dentist's business.

21:18.612 --> 21:21.740
You going to wash your hands?
How about some gloves?

21:23.534 --> 21:26.328
Bernice, would you bring
that box of gloves?

21:28.205 --> 21:32.042
I'd appreciate it if you'd sterilize
your instruments one more time.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.585
Anything else, doctor?

21:33.627 --> 21:36.463
Perhaps the equipment
is too old for your liking,

21:36.505 --> 21:40.008
or maybe you miss the music,
is that it?

21:40.050 --> 21:43.262
You like a little elevator
music with your dentistry?

21:43.303 --> 21:46.056
How about some Lysol
in the cabinets?

21:53.772 --> 21:56.859
Sure you want me to put
in your cap?

21:56.900 --> 21:59.403
You're the only game in town.

22:00.404 --> 22:02.364
Yes, I am.

22:06.785 --> 22:08.245
Open up.

22:12.249 --> 22:15.085
This is a country practice, doctor.

22:15.127 --> 22:18.255
Granted, it's plain and simple,

22:18.297 --> 22:21.800
but the folks around here seem
to like it just fine.

22:21.842 --> 22:24.803
So, I'd be obliged, city boy,

22:24.845 --> 22:27.431
if you'd keep your opinions
to yourself

22:27.472 --> 22:31.268
and your fingers out of
my patients' mouths.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.227
( Continues honking )

23:20.692 --> 23:21.818
Asshole.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.153
Cretin.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.126
Burns.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.213
Burns!

23:43.423 --> 23:44.967
( Country music playing )

24:03.861 --> 24:05.988
You incompetent buffoon.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.407
What are you doing here?

24:08.448 --> 24:10.033
Look at this.

24:10.075 --> 24:12.828
What did you use, library paste?

24:12.870 --> 24:15.205
And you call yourself a dentist?

24:15.205 --> 24:18.625
You stay away from me.
Bernice! Bernice!

24:19.710 --> 24:21.712
Oh, Bernice is out to lunch.

24:21.712 --> 24:23.714
In more ways than one.

24:23.755 --> 24:27.217
Drill 'em,
fill 'em, bill 'em...

24:28.302 --> 24:31.513
that's your philosophy, huh?

24:31.555 --> 24:35.017
You know, you and your
ilk, Doctor Burns...

24:35.058 --> 24:37.394
make dentists the boogeymen
of medicine.

24:37.436 --> 24:39.730
Something to be feared...

24:39.771 --> 24:42.482
to be avoided at all costs.

24:44.943 --> 24:49.198
I've worked my entire career
to change all that.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.579
You see, a trip to the dentist
should be pleasant,

24:55.579 --> 24:58.999
something to look forward to.

25:00.751 --> 25:06.089
That is, of course, if the dentist
in question is competent.

25:07.257 --> 25:10.052
It's not the cap,
you're a fruitcake.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.555
Funny you should mention that.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.224
You're scaring me.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.561
I'm trying to.

25:19.603 --> 25:25.692
Now, repeat after me,
''I am an incompetent dentist...''

25:25.734 --> 25:26.902
Say it.

25:26.944 --> 25:31.907
I... am...
an incompetent dentist.

25:31.949 --> 25:33.408
Now...

25:33.450 --> 25:35.244
- I...
- I...

25:35.285 --> 25:36.662
- am...
- am...

25:36.703 --> 25:38.288
- a...
- a...

25:38.330 --> 25:39.998
bogeyman.

26:05.315 --> 26:07.317
I can deal with this.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.244
( Opera music plays )

27:02.372 --> 27:05.792
( Phone rings )

27:05.834 --> 27:10.380
Your call is being answered by
a machine, please leave a message.

27:12.216 --> 27:15.552
Love and kisses from
your favorite private eye.

27:15.552 --> 27:19.348
I'm in Grand Junction, Colorado.

27:19.389 --> 27:24.520
No luck so far,
next stop is North Platt, Nebraska.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.689
Up with people.

27:27.731 --> 27:29.399
Ciao, baby.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.380
Too bad about Doc Burns, isn't it?

27:51.421 --> 27:54.383
Yes. Yes it is.

27:55.259 --> 27:57.803
And too bad for Paradise.

27:57.845 --> 27:59.763
The answer is no, Jeremy.

28:01.431 --> 28:04.601
Well, I didn't get where I am
by accepting no for an answer.

28:08.063 --> 28:12.359
I have a responsibility. What kind of
town would this be without a dentist?

28:13.485 --> 28:15.779
You won't even consider it?

28:15.821 --> 28:17.573
No.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.741
Just till we find somebody.

28:19.783 --> 28:22.452
What part of ''no'' don't
you understand, Jeremy?

28:35.382 --> 28:39.970
I did not give up a
lucrative practice in Washington

28:40.012 --> 28:43.140
to start from scratch
somewhere else.

28:43.182 --> 28:45.934
Sweet deal for somebody,

28:45.976 --> 28:48.604
house, practice,
everything for a song.

28:48.645 --> 28:51.732
Promise me you'll
at least think it over.

29:02.659 --> 29:04.661
Afternoon, doctor.

29:07.831 --> 29:10.417
Let me show you around.

29:15.923 --> 29:19.092
A little spackle, fresh coat of paint,
maybe some new carpeting,

29:19.134 --> 29:22.930
you've got yourself
one fine, little office here.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.145
Come on in, city boy.
( Laughing )

29:31.897 --> 29:33.732
( Laughing )

29:42.783 --> 29:47.037
Feinstone her, Dr. Caine.
Feinstone the bitch.

29:49.039 --> 29:50.874
No, no, no...no.

30:07.224 --> 30:09.017
Hey.

30:11.395 --> 30:13.355
You're home early.

30:13.397 --> 30:15.649
I wasn't feeling well.

30:15.691 --> 30:17.568
What's wrong?

30:17.609 --> 30:21.405
Um, a toothache. It's nothing.

30:21.446 --> 30:25.617
I have an appointment Saturday
with Dr. Davis over in Otis.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.412
That's 7O miles away.

30:32.291 --> 30:34.251
May I look at it?

31:24.843 --> 31:27.137
All right.
Want to open for me?

31:27.179 --> 31:31.600
( Inner voices )
Feinstone her, Dr. Caine.
Feinstone the bitch.

31:33.560 --> 31:35.395
Are you okay, Larry?

31:37.189 --> 31:39.816
I'm fine, just open,
open wide, Jamie.

31:50.327 --> 31:52.120
Sensitive?

31:56.208 --> 32:01.338
It's nothing serious. You just have
a small cavity near the gum line.

32:01.380 --> 32:05.425
And, um, I think it's
best if we fill it.

32:05.467 --> 32:07.135
Is it going to hurt?

32:09.054 --> 32:10.806
Shouldn't.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.438
Want to open wide?

32:20.858 --> 32:23.277
All right, turn your head a little
this way. There we go.

32:36.957 --> 32:38.375
That's it.

32:38.375 --> 32:41.879
That's it?
I didn't even feel it.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.839
You're not supposed to.

33:32.596 --> 33:34.431
Are you okay, Larry?

33:40.562 --> 33:42.564
I...I'm going to
have to change this burr.

34:09.007 --> 34:13.428
( Inner voice ) Feinstone her,
Dr. Caine. Feinstone her.

34:20.143 --> 34:22.145
I am not crazy.

34:22.145 --> 34:25.274
I am not going to hurt her.

34:26.859 --> 34:29.027
Jamie:
Is there anything wrong?

34:33.407 --> 34:34.741
No, no, I'm fine.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.034
Just cleaning the instruments.

34:37.077 --> 34:38.786
Be right with you.

34:45.460 --> 34:48.130
Why is it so scary
to come to the dentist?

34:51.884 --> 34:53.844
It doesn't have to be.

34:57.306 --> 34:58.974
All right.

35:00.517 --> 35:03.312
I'll have you fixed up in no time.

35:07.608 --> 35:09.318
Ready?

35:15.240 --> 35:17.701
I did it. I did it.

35:20.078 --> 35:21.830
I'm a dentist.

35:23.290 --> 35:26.460
I'm the best damn
dentist there ever was.

35:34.301 --> 35:35.761
Are you excited?

35:35.802 --> 35:39.723
Excited?
Yes, I uh...I think I am.

35:39.723 --> 35:42.684
Well the people of
Paradise thank you, Larry.

35:42.726 --> 35:44.102
Lawrence.

35:44.144 --> 35:45.604
Hey, hey.
Picture time.

35:48.065 --> 35:51.610
No, I just want Larry in front of
the sign. He's the man of the hour.

35:53.612 --> 35:54.571
Boo.

36:01.119 --> 36:04.456
You know, I could fix that.

36:04.498 --> 36:07.334
Oh, I'm used to it.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.879
Whenever you're ready.

36:12.256 --> 36:15.050
Jamie, let me show
you the house.

36:18.971 --> 36:21.014
I haven't really
changed the structure.

36:21.056 --> 36:23.225
I mean the layout
is pretty much the same.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.902
This is nice.

36:37.281 --> 36:39.741
You've done wonders.

36:39.783 --> 36:47.332
I believe a harmonious environment is
essential to the dental experience.

36:48.458 --> 36:50.544
This one is just perfect.

36:50.586 --> 36:53.422
Perfect?
Oh, not quite.

36:54.590 --> 36:58.635
I'm reserving that for the operatory
that I'm creating upstairs.

36:59.636 --> 37:01.972
Coming up, watch your back.

37:01.972 --> 37:05.601
- I can't wait to see it.
- You'll be the first.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.000
Ah, well.
My first patient.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.190
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Ah, well.
My first patient.

37:11.190 --> 37:11.231
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:11.231 --> 37:13.650
-You look very nice.
- See ya.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:13.650 --> 37:17.654
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.654 --> 37:20.449
Just a small country practice.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.449 --> 37:21.658
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:21.658 --> 37:22.000
I think
I'm going to like it here.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:24.077
I think
I'm going to like it here.

37:30.501 --> 37:34.171
I've got a feeling he's going
to be real good for this town.

37:47.935 --> 37:50.562
( Phone rings )

37:54.775 --> 37:55.818
Hello?

37:55.859 --> 37:58.529
Hi, Jamie.
Are you still hard at work?

37:58.570 --> 38:02.699
I'm about ready to quit for the night.
How's the filing coming?

38:02.741 --> 38:07.329
At this rate I should be done
somewhere around the millennium.

38:07.371 --> 38:09.915
- That bad?
- Worse.

38:09.957 --> 38:13.961
- Anyway, I just called to say hi.
- Hi.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.171
I'll talk to you tomorrow, huh?

38:16.213 --> 38:17.506
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

38:20.467 --> 38:23.262
( Loud knocking at door )

38:34.439 --> 38:36.817
- Dr. Caine?
- Yes.

38:36.859 --> 38:39.153
Oh, am I glad to see you.

38:39.194 --> 38:42.281
The cab jockey thought you
might be working late.

38:42.322 --> 38:44.491
I thought I'd give it a shot.

38:44.533 --> 38:46.994
My damn tooth is killing me.

38:47.035 --> 38:48.787
Uh, come in.

38:50.747 --> 38:54.251
You're a Hall of Famer, Doc.
A Hall of Famer.

38:55.752 --> 38:59.089
You think when we're finished you
could give me a ride to the bus stop?

38:59.131 --> 39:01.508
I've got to catch the 1O:4O to K.C.

39:01.550 --> 39:06.221
A ride?
I'm a dentist, not a cab jockey.

39:06.263 --> 39:10.642
You know, the motel guy said
the only dentist in town was dead.

39:10.684 --> 39:13.228
I had to track you down.

39:13.270 --> 39:15.564
You're kind of flying
under the radar, Doc.

39:17.649 --> 39:20.736
( Laughing )
Kind of like Stealth Dentist.

39:20.777 --> 39:23.322
Well sir, you found me.

39:23.363 --> 39:26.158
I guess tonight
is my lucky night.

39:26.200 --> 39:28.243
We'll see.

39:29.286 --> 39:33.707
I'm from the left coast.
L.A., la la land.

39:33.749 --> 39:37.836
Swimming pools,
movie stars, boob jobs.

39:37.878 --> 39:42.466
I'm on my way to K.C. Thinking about
doing a little real estate speculating.

39:42.508 --> 39:45.844
You know,
my rental car broke down.

39:45.886 --> 39:48.597
And they started
to hassle me about it.

39:48.639 --> 39:52.434
I told them to shove it, you know.
I'll just take the bus.

39:54.811 --> 39:59.775
Have you ever been to L.A., Doc?
Have we ever met before?

39:59.816 --> 40:03.237
God, I swear
you look familiar.

40:04.988 --> 40:06.990
Go ahead and
open your mouth, sir.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.909
You have a bus to catch.

40:08.951 --> 40:12.871
I, I'm terrible with names,
but I never forget a face.

40:17.501 --> 40:19.503
- Ah, ah.
- Hold still.

40:22.422 --> 40:25.217
Doc, that hurts
like a bitch.

40:25.259 --> 40:28.220
You're not going in there dry,
are you, Doc?

40:28.262 --> 40:31.056
I mean, I'm not anti-narcotics.

40:32.683 --> 40:34.852
I'll administer an anesthetic.

40:34.893 --> 40:36.186
Good.

40:37.354 --> 40:42.901
Hey you know, just last year,
I picked out a guy at Dodger Stadium,

40:42.943 --> 40:47.489
two sections over. I knew this guy
from somewhere, I didn't know where.

40:47.531 --> 40:52.828
And then it hit me.
St. Paul, 1983...

40:52.870 --> 40:55.998
...footwear expo.
Florsheim booth.

40:57.082 --> 41:00.210
I went over and checked it out.
It was him. Hee hee.

41:01.253 --> 41:03.213
I never forget a face.

41:05.549 --> 41:08.177
Have you every been to
Dodger Stadium, Doc?

41:08.218 --> 41:12.598
No, that's not it. But don't tell me,
don't tell me. It's coming.

41:12.639 --> 41:14.850
You're definitely
Southern California.

41:15.893 --> 41:18.187
I detest baseball.

41:18.228 --> 41:20.189
Oh, I'm never wrong, Doc.

41:20.230 --> 41:21.899
Would you please sit still?

41:26.528 --> 41:29.531
( Inner voice ) Ever been to L.A., Doc?
I swear you look familiar.

41:30.574 --> 41:33.076
I never forget a face.

41:35.412 --> 41:37.831
Oh I'm never wrong, Doc. Never.

41:37.873 --> 41:40.083
You're definitely
Southern California.

41:43.921 --> 41:45.756
You did that on purpose.

41:49.426 --> 41:51.386
I know you.

41:52.679 --> 41:54.306
Fishbein or Feinbein.

41:55.891 --> 41:59.102
Feinburg... the crazy dentist.

41:59.144 --> 42:02.606
Sir, sit back down.
I cannot leave that tooth untreated.

42:04.233 --> 42:06.068
I took an oath.

42:12.157 --> 42:14.159
Get out of
the doorway, nutball.

42:14.201 --> 42:18.121
This crazy dentist of yours,

42:18.163 --> 42:20.541
this Fein...stone,

42:25.003 --> 42:27.923
Would he get
out of the doorway?

42:48.527 --> 42:51.113
I'm sorry, man.
I've got to go.

43:01.206 --> 43:03.792
Do you still want that ride?

43:06.086 --> 43:08.630
No. I'm a walker.

43:55.385 --> 44:00.516
You just couldn't have your
toothache someplace else, could you?

44:22.621 --> 44:27.084
Insane, deranged, demented.

44:27.084 --> 44:31.421
Psychotic, nuts,
nutso, nutcase.

44:31.463 --> 44:34.925
Nutball, loco.

44:34.967 --> 44:39.137
Loony, apeshit, wacko.

44:41.765 --> 44:44.643
Oh, I didn't want to...

44:44.685 --> 44:52.860
I didn't want to do it.
I tried not to. I tried not to do it.

45:00.450 --> 45:02.286
Okay, okay.

45:02.327 --> 45:05.414
I'm going to make this work.
I'm going to make this work.

45:05.455 --> 45:07.666
I will make this work.

45:07.708 --> 45:11.420
I am in control.
I am in control.

45:11.461 --> 45:13.213
I am not crazy...

45:13.255 --> 45:16.508
I am not crazy.
I am not insane.

45:16.550 --> 45:18.510
I am not a monster.

45:20.304 --> 45:23.807
Private eye:
Hello there. It's me.

45:23.849 --> 45:25.601
Hey, how are you doing?

45:25.642 --> 45:29.980
I'll bet you you'll never
guess where I'm off to next.

45:30.022 --> 45:33.025
Paradise, Missouri.

45:33.066 --> 45:35.903
Paradise, can you believe it?

45:35.944 --> 45:37.613
See you later.

45:48.499 --> 45:49.333
Back off, Bev.

45:49.374 --> 45:52.252
I know, I just can't get
this image out of my head.

45:52.294 --> 45:56.798
I keep imagining you in this canoe,
with this handsome, mysterious stranger.

45:56.840 --> 45:59.468
Rushing down a raging river,
waterfalls...

45:59.510 --> 46:02.930
boulders, white water...and he's
the only one with a life preserver on.

46:03.013 --> 46:04.598
You're an alarmist.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.267
No, I prefer to
see myself as a cynic.

46:07.309 --> 46:09.061
And the cynic in me says...

46:09.102 --> 46:11.146
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:11.188 --> 46:13.023
Haven't seen you in a week.

46:13.065 --> 46:15.317
Yeah, I got a job over in Otis.
I was staying with my cousin.

46:15.359 --> 46:17.653
- I've got to go.
- Bye.

46:19.196 --> 46:21.990
So I hear you rented your
cottage to the new dentist.

46:22.032 --> 46:23.742
To Dr. Caine.

46:23.784 --> 46:25.410
So what do you think of him?

46:25.452 --> 46:26.870
He's nice.

46:26.912 --> 46:28.997
Hey, I'm scheduled to do
some work in his office.

46:29.039 --> 46:33.335
He's...he's not coming
between us, is he?

46:34.878 --> 46:35.921
No.

46:37.339 --> 46:40.217
Oh God, Robbie, you're not going to
propose again, are you?

46:42.386 --> 46:45.180
Jamie Devers,
will you marry me?

46:45.222 --> 46:47.266
No.

46:47.307 --> 46:49.685
No? Why?

46:51.979 --> 46:55.274
Because I...
like you too much.

47:03.615 --> 47:06.243
No, not again.

47:13.292 --> 47:15.669
- Enjoy your blueberry pie, sir.
- Ah, blueberry...

47:22.509 --> 47:24.386
Got a minute, sweetheart?

47:25.345 --> 47:27.264
I can give you a second.

47:28.724 --> 47:33.061
Just figured you were the type that
would help out a fellow human being.

47:34.605 --> 47:36.356
Give me a break.

47:37.774 --> 47:44.281
I saw a guy in town today who
looked like an old army buddy.

47:44.323 --> 47:46.700
Maybe you could
help me track him down.

47:46.742 --> 47:49.953
I'm staying right at the edge of town,
in the Sleepeasy Motel.

47:56.585 --> 47:59.796
Hey Bev. There's a little guy at
the end of the counter,

47:59.838 --> 48:02.424
seems real interested in Doc Caine.

48:02.466 --> 48:05.010
Asking all sorts of questions.

48:05.052 --> 48:08.055
Thinks he knows him from the
service or something. From L.A.

48:09.264 --> 48:11.225
What little guy?

48:14.728 --> 48:17.815
You'd be surprised how
people neglect their teeth.

48:17.856 --> 48:20.901
If they were only as
diligent as you, Margaret.

48:20.943 --> 48:23.237
Some people never learn.

48:26.865 --> 48:28.450
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:28.492 --> 48:31.119
Jeremy needs you to sign these.

48:31.161 --> 48:33.705
Hi Jamie. I'll be done with
Margaret in just a moment.

48:33.747 --> 48:35.249
Hey, Margaret.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.504
So I...I saw you earlier.

48:40.546 --> 48:42.005
Where?

48:42.047 --> 48:46.969
Oh, in town,
by the cafe, with some guy.

48:48.846 --> 48:50.472
Robbie?

48:50.514 --> 48:52.891
Robbie.
Is that his name?

48:52.933 --> 48:55.936
Robbie... Well, you didn't
tell me about Robbie, did you?

48:57.813 --> 49:00.023
There's nothing to tell.

49:00.065 --> 49:02.484
( Muffled )
There's nothing to tell.

49:02.526 --> 49:05.070
That's not what it looked like
from where I was sitting.

49:07.531 --> 49:09.741
Is he a good kisser?

49:09.783 --> 49:13.745
Did you see the part when he
was on bended knee proposing to me?

49:15.706 --> 49:17.332
Proposing?

49:17.374 --> 49:20.752
Yeah, it's a joke.
I mean, he does this every month.

49:20.794 --> 49:23.130
He proposes every month,
it's a joke...

49:24.131 --> 49:25.299
Spit, Margaret.

49:28.010 --> 49:31.013
Robbie is one of my oldest
and dearest friends.

49:31.054 --> 49:33.432
I mean I've known him
since I was in third grade.

49:33.473 --> 49:35.684
Little kids, babies...

49:36.393 --> 49:39.605
Friends. I mean, that's all it is.
That's all it ever will be.

49:43.150 --> 49:44.693
- Friends?
- Friends.

49:46.028 --> 49:47.696
Just friends?

52:33.111 --> 52:35.072
( Hears laughing )

53:13.777 --> 53:17.573
( Pneumatic nail gun )
Excuse me. Hello.

53:17.614 --> 53:20.409
I'm with a patient,
could you please...?

53:20.450 --> 53:22.911
Would you stop--

53:31.295 --> 53:33.755
Hey. Hey, hey.

53:37.759 --> 53:38.969
Hey.

53:39.011 --> 53:40.554
I'm with a patient right now.

53:40.596 --> 53:44.474
If you could just give me
15 minutes or so.

53:44.516 --> 53:46.476
In case you haven't
put it together,

53:46.518 --> 53:50.397
I'm the jerk who cut you
off the other day in town and...

53:50.439 --> 53:51.732
anyway, I'm sorry.

53:51.773 --> 53:52.649
No problem, man.

53:52.691 --> 53:55.277
I'm Robbie Mauro,
I'm the drywall guy.

53:55.319 --> 53:57.446
Aren't you living
in Jamie's cottage?

53:57.488 --> 53:59.198
Yeah, yeah,
that's right.

54:01.283 --> 54:04.161
- She's...spoken of you.
- Yeah?

54:04.161 --> 54:08.123
About how you've been friends
since you were children.

54:08.165 --> 54:10.959
I've been in love with
Jamie since the third grade.

54:11.001 --> 54:13.212
Third grade, huh?

54:13.253 --> 54:15.172
How about Jamie?

54:15.172 --> 54:18.008
Oh, she's in love with me.
She just doesn't know it.

54:18.050 --> 54:19.593
Oh yeah?

54:25.682 --> 54:28.268
I'm terribly sorry...

54:28.310 --> 54:30.979
I, I didn't know it was loaded.

54:38.028 --> 54:40.322
( Typing - phones ringing )

54:48.872 --> 54:50.666
Gotcha.

54:50.707 --> 54:53.460
He doesn't exist.

54:53.502 --> 54:54.878
What are you talking about?

54:54.920 --> 54:57.714
Larry Caine.
He has no credit history.

54:57.756 --> 55:00.509
I checked and re-checked.
The man is a blank.

55:00.551 --> 55:03.679
He was somebody else
before he came to paradise.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.307
Bev, this is nonsense.

55:07.349 --> 55:12.062
No, there was a guy at the cafe. Said he
was sure he knew him from Los Angeles.

55:12.104 --> 55:13.689
Not Washington.

55:13.730 --> 55:18.360
Larry Caine is a valued customer of
our bank and an asset to our town.

55:18.402 --> 55:21.405
I think you've been reading too
many murder mysteries, Bev.

55:23.323 --> 55:26.660
Well, he could be one of those
Medicare fraud doctors,

55:26.702 --> 55:30.330
who you see ducking behind
doors on 6O Minutes.

55:30.372 --> 55:32.166
Thank you, Bev.

55:32.207 --> 55:35.752
Dammit, Jeremy. He could be married,
with a wife and kids.

55:38.589 --> 55:40.591
Thank you, Mrs. Swales.

55:40.632 --> 55:43.760
( Phone ringing )

55:43.802 --> 55:45.387
Bank of Paradise.
This is Jamie.

55:45.429 --> 55:47.973
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

55:48.015 --> 55:52.227
Listen, I'm standing outside
the office on the grounds here,

55:52.269 --> 55:54.605
and I've been thinking
about you all day.

55:54.646 --> 55:57.441
And I was hoping you'd do me the
honor of joining me for dinner

55:57.483 --> 55:59.693
at the most exclusive
restaurant in town.

56:01.195 --> 56:03.530
No, not the Paradise Cafe.

56:05.115 --> 56:07.534
Something much
better than that.

56:24.218 --> 56:26.053
- Hi
- Hi.

56:26.094 --> 56:28.680
- You look great.
- You too.

56:28.722 --> 56:30.599
I love my dress.

56:31.642 --> 56:34.311
But, how did you know my size?

56:34.353 --> 56:37.272
Perfect only comes in one size.

56:38.649 --> 56:40.400
- Where are we going?
- Shhh!

56:49.743 --> 56:52.788
Oh Larry, I just love
what you've done out here.

56:57.292 --> 57:00.212
Under the stars,
in the dark of night,

57:00.254 --> 57:02.506
silence the woes,
and give love its flight.

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:53.015 --> 57:56.435
Stay...
stay right here.

57:58.604 --> 58:00.189
Don't move.

58:32.679 --> 58:34.723
I should put these in water.

58:38.268 --> 58:40.270
They'll keep.

58:40.270 --> 58:41.438
No they won't.

58:43.607 --> 58:47.194
I'll bring
you more tomorrow.

58:47.236 --> 58:49.530
I want these.

58:51.156 --> 58:53.742
( Phone ringing )
Don't answer that.

58:53.784 --> 58:55.911
Answer what?

58:56.954 --> 59:00.541
Robbie: Hey, Jamie,
I guess you're not in.

59:00.582 --> 59:03.335
Look, my cousin Louis and his wife
are going to be in town Friday.

59:03.377 --> 59:06.046
I figured wouldn't it be cool,
you and me have dinner with them?

59:06.088 --> 59:09.299
You being my future wife
and all. It will be fun.

59:09.341 --> 59:12.135
Oh, yeah.
This is Robbie.

59:12.177 --> 59:15.097
Seriously, Jamie.
I'd like to see you more.

59:15.138 --> 59:17.432
I can't seem to get that
Thanksgiving out of my head.

59:17.474 --> 59:20.853
Let's go to my room, Larry.

59:20.894 --> 59:23.021
Let me know. Bye.
( Beeps )

59:24.481 --> 59:28.861
Your oldest, dearest, friend
is in love with you, Jamie.

59:30.529 --> 59:32.656
No, he's not.

59:32.698 --> 59:36.160
Mr. Drywall
is in love with you.

59:37.327 --> 59:39.413
And how do you feel
about him, Jamie?

59:42.124 --> 59:44.877
I told you
how I feel about him.

59:44.918 --> 59:49.506
But you didn't tell me about that
very special Thanksgiving, though,

59:49.548 --> 59:51.008
did you?

59:56.555 --> 59:59.057
I had just...

59:59.099 --> 01:00:03.228
Larry, I lost both of my parents
in less than 6 months. I just...

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.148
And...and what?

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:09.818
And I was invited over to a friend's
house for Thanksgiving dinner.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.070
Robbie was there.

01:00:12.112 --> 01:00:14.448
I was just lonely.
Larry, it meant nothing.

01:00:14.490 --> 01:00:19.661
Oh no, it meant something.
Believe me. It meant something.

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:24.082
- You don't get it.
- Oh I get it. Believe me, I get it.

01:00:25.584 --> 01:00:28.045
Would you stop cleaning
my kitchen.

01:00:50.275 --> 01:00:52.945
I'm sorry. I...

01:01:02.788 --> 01:01:06.792
Just can't get enough of those
blue collar types, can you?

01:01:19.012 --> 01:01:22.182
Goes by the name of Caine.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:54.006
ELEVEN ROSES TO SAY I'M SORRY...

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:56.091
And the twelfth one is with him.

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:06.894
In review of our membership...

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:08.896
He couldn't be Dr. Caine.

01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:12.316
Hello.

01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:41.386
Doctor's office.

01:02:41.428 --> 01:02:43.347
Who is it?

01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:47.059
It's Bev from the bank. She wants
an appointment for this afternoon.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:50.729
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:53.816
It'll be fine, Bev. 4:3O?

01:02:58.529 --> 01:03:01.406
Any other calls?
Jamie?

01:03:01.448 --> 01:03:03.325
No.

01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:08.789
Desert Storm?

01:03:10.666 --> 01:03:12.835
The Gulf War was over in 1991.

01:03:12.876 --> 01:03:17.005
That would make this
magazine what, Bernice?

01:03:17.047 --> 01:03:21.301
The answer is, ''out of date.''
This is an out of date magazine.

01:03:21.343 --> 01:03:25.097
How many times did I tell you
to get rid of all of these?

01:03:26.348 --> 01:03:28.517
Here, want me to help you?

01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:36.775
I think I'd better go.

01:04:09.266 --> 01:04:12.144
- Where are you going?
- Fact finding mission.

01:04:13.187 --> 01:04:17.232
- Don't forget about tonight.
- Oh, I'll be there. With bells on.

01:05:00.984 --> 01:05:02.611
Bernice?

01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:07.616
Dr. Caine?

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:17.543
Hello?

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:45.571
Thanks for being on time, Bev.

01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:47.531
Oh, jezze.

01:05:47.573 --> 01:05:49.741
I, I wasn't snooping.

01:05:49.783 --> 01:05:52.828
I just wanted to
look at my file.

01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:55.205
Really. I've wanted to look at
my file since I was a kid.

01:05:55.247 --> 01:05:57.166
Sanderson, Emil.

01:05:57.207 --> 01:05:59.042
Your file is inside.

01:06:00.961 --> 01:06:04.464
The first time I peeked in
my files I was in college.

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.140
Now, to more important things...

01:06:14.892 --> 01:06:17.019
...this discolored tooth of yours.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:19.855
Oh, it's been that way
since junior high.

01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:24.026
It should have been
taken care of. Lean forward.

01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:30.240
Let's have a look,
shall we?

01:06:32.242 --> 01:06:35.496
Open wide for me.
Smile, a big smile.

01:06:44.046 --> 01:06:47.758
As long as we're
bonding your incisor,

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:50.802
that's that discolored tooth,

01:06:50.844 --> 01:06:53.555
we could do all your teeth,

01:06:53.597 --> 01:06:57.267
make them a few shades lighter,

01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:59.895
give you that Hollywood smile.

01:06:59.937 --> 01:07:02.731
All of them? You think?

01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:05.067
I'd just like them whiter

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:06.735
without anyone noticing
that I did anything.

01:07:06.777 --> 01:07:09.905
If that's possible.

01:07:09.947 --> 01:07:11.782
Anything is possible.

01:07:13.075 --> 01:07:14.201
Open.

01:07:15.285 --> 01:07:17.287
So...

01:07:17.287 --> 01:07:20.582
You ever been to
Hollywood, Larry?

01:07:20.624 --> 01:07:23.043
I went to
Washington D.C. once.

01:07:24.795 --> 01:07:26.463
I bet you miss it.

01:07:26.505 --> 01:07:29.591
Washington... home.

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:33.887
I mean, it's exciting.
It's our nation's capital.

01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:36.265
Funny...

01:07:36.306 --> 01:07:38.892
What's that, Bev?

01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:43.063
There was this guy, passed through
town day before yesterday.

01:07:43.105 --> 01:07:46.275
He said he was sure
he knew you from Los Angeles.

01:07:46.316 --> 01:07:49.111
But that couldn't be.

01:07:49.153 --> 01:07:51.196
You being from D.C. and all.

01:07:53.157 --> 01:07:55.784
No. No it couldn't.

01:07:58.745 --> 01:08:00.581
Could it, Bev?

01:08:00.622 --> 01:08:04.710
He was grilling Shawna at the cafe.
A little guy, she said.

01:08:04.751 --> 01:08:07.462
This little guy.
Does he have a name?

01:08:07.504 --> 01:08:08.630
I don't know.

01:08:10.174 --> 01:08:11.967
Well let's see
what you do know.

01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:18.849
What are you doing? Hey.

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:25.981
Breathe, Bev.

01:08:26.023 --> 01:08:27.649
Breathe.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.158
Breathe.

01:08:37.201 --> 01:08:39.077
Yeah.

01:08:41.078 --> 01:08:44.917
Wake up, Bev.
It's time to go to school.

01:08:44.957 --> 01:08:47.377
Five more minutes, daddy...

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.381
What?

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:55.135
Oh my God...

01:08:55.176 --> 01:08:56.136
What?

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.640
Oh, my God.

01:09:03.227 --> 01:09:05.437
Larry, you can't do this.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:08.023
What, bond your teeth?

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:10.484
Please let me go.
Please let me go.

01:09:13.237 --> 01:09:15.572
This is how we bond our teeth...

01:09:17.157 --> 01:09:19.201
...in Hollywood, Bevie.

01:09:19.243 --> 01:09:23.037
Bonding in bondage.

01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:24.915
It's all the rage.

01:09:24.957 --> 01:09:26.917
Please don't hurt me, Larry.

01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:31.796
Oh sure. You come in here
under false pretenses.

01:09:31.839 --> 01:09:35.759
Nose through my files, you sit there
asking all your wheedling questions.

01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:38.345
And then you
beg me not to hurt you?

01:09:38.386 --> 01:09:41.140
What world do you live in, Bevie?

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:12.337
Now the nerve's exposed,

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:15.424
and we can commence
with a little game.

01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:18.844
A lie detector test,
if you will.

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.929
I'll ask a question,

01:10:20.971 --> 01:10:22.347
and you answer it.

01:10:22.389 --> 01:10:24.641
If you tell the truth,

01:10:24.683 --> 01:10:27.436
I'll pat your head.

01:10:27.478 --> 01:10:30.856
If you lie,

01:10:30.898 --> 01:10:32.566
I shall do this...

01:10:33.192 --> 01:10:34.485
( Screaming )

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.743
I think you get it.

01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:44.912
Now the first question is:

01:10:44.953 --> 01:10:47.331
What do you know about me?

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:50.751
I know what everybody
else knows.

01:10:50.792 --> 01:10:53.253
Oh Bev, wrong answer.

01:11:15.108 --> 01:11:19.196
Now.
The question was:

01:11:19.238 --> 01:11:23.200
Exactly what
do you know about me?

01:11:23.242 --> 01:11:27.204
I know that you're not
really Dr. Lawrence Caine.

01:11:27.246 --> 01:11:29.206
That I'm not really
Dr. Lawrence Caine?

01:11:29.206 --> 01:11:32.584
I know you were somebody
else six years ago.

01:11:32.626 --> 01:11:34.670
Good. Good.

01:11:36.839 --> 01:11:38.507
Now, next question:

01:11:38.549 --> 01:11:42.386
Why all those clumsy
questions about Washington?

01:11:42.427 --> 01:11:45.889
I didn't think
you lived in Washington.

01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:47.975
You didn't think
I lived in Washington?

01:11:50.519 --> 01:11:53.230
Good, good Bev.

01:11:53.272 --> 01:11:57.985
Do you know who I was
before I was Dr. Lawrence Caine?

01:11:58.026 --> 01:11:59.444
No.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:01.905
No?

01:12:03.991 --> 01:12:05.534
Wrong answer.

01:12:16.295 --> 01:12:18.589
( Buzzer sounds )

01:12:20.132 --> 01:12:21.508
( Sobbing )

01:12:24.094 --> 01:12:26.388
Help me.

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.686
Somebody help me.

01:12:36.607 --> 01:12:40.152
If you say a word,
if you utter a sound while I'm gone,

01:12:40.194 --> 01:12:42.821
I will cut out your
vocal cords with this.

01:12:42.863 --> 01:12:44.239
Do you understand?

01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:10.474
- Robbie. What can I do for you?
- I got the last of the drywall here.

01:13:10.516 --> 01:13:12.309
Well, I'm with a
patient right now.

01:13:12.351 --> 01:13:15.896
Bev? Because I noticed
her car was out there.

01:13:15.938 --> 01:13:18.607
Yes.
We're...bonding.

01:13:22.986 --> 01:13:23.821
Help.

01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:27.491
( Bev screaming )

01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:29.993
The novocaine
must have worn off.

01:13:30.035 --> 01:13:33.413
I'm going to have to ask you to
stay outside. It's very important...

01:13:33.455 --> 01:13:34.706
Don't...

01:13:45.425 --> 01:13:46.927
Bev!

01:13:47.469 --> 01:13:48.679
Robbie!

01:14:06.029 --> 01:14:07.531
Oh, Robbie!

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.500
No!

01:14:49.031 --> 01:14:51.700
Bev, Bev, Bev...

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:58.040
Here we were, two pals
playing a friendly little game,

01:14:58.081 --> 01:15:00.709
the minute I turn my back,

01:15:00.751 --> 01:15:02.127
you cheat.

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:06.882
Get off me.
Get off me.

01:15:16.517 --> 01:15:19.102
New game, Bevie.

01:15:19.144 --> 01:15:21.730
Truth...

01:15:21.772 --> 01:15:23.232
...or tooth.

01:15:32.699 --> 01:15:36.078
What did you tell Jeremy
about Washington?

01:15:36.119 --> 01:15:38.247
I didn't tell.
I didn't tell...

01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:56.181
Your discolored tooth was a problem.
Not a problem any more.

01:15:56.223 --> 01:15:59.059
I can see that you
floss regularly, Bev.

01:15:59.101 --> 01:16:00.269
I like that.

01:16:03.689 --> 01:16:06.150
Now, Jamie.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:08.277
What did you tell Jamie?

01:16:08.318 --> 01:16:10.279
( Mumbling )

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:14.074
Yeah?
Are you sure?

01:16:15.742 --> 01:16:19.705
Oh, Bev. You liar.

01:16:30.465 --> 01:16:32.759
Damn it, I broke it.

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:41.018
Darn. This is the part I hate.
I don't mind telling you, Bevie,

01:16:41.059 --> 01:16:43.479
pulling teeth is like, well...

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.022
pulling teeth.

01:16:48.233 --> 01:16:50.819
You're looking
much better already.

01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:07.711
Give me back my drill.

01:17:12.966 --> 01:17:16.720
Okay,
I've got a much better idea.

01:17:16.762 --> 01:17:18.931
A much better idea.

01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:20.766
Oh Bev,
you're going to love this.

01:17:22.434 --> 01:17:24.102
We'll cut it out.

01:18:41.263 --> 01:18:43.432
( Sinister laugh )

01:18:59.156 --> 01:19:01.116
( Woman laughing )

01:20:01.552 --> 01:20:03.846
( Dialing )

01:20:08.183 --> 01:20:09.726
( Phone ringing )

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.355
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:13.355 --> 01:20:14.690
Brooke...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.692
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:16.692 --> 01:20:20.154
The doctor isn't in right now.
Please leave a message.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.154 --> 01:20:21.196
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.196 --> 01:20:22.000
It's me...
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.032
It's me...

01:20:24.074 --> 01:20:25.200
You can speak?

01:20:25.242 --> 01:20:27.202
Both of us
overreacted last night.

01:20:29.204 --> 01:20:32.666
And I'm sorry if
I said anything that hurt you,

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:34.543
that wasn't my intention.

01:20:34.585 --> 01:20:36.879
It's too late for apologies.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:38.714
Jamie:
I'm almost at your office.

01:20:38.755 --> 01:20:41.842
Do you think
I wanted to do that to you?

01:20:41.884 --> 01:20:44.928
Jamie:
I'm coming for the twelfth rose.

01:20:48.348 --> 01:20:49.933
I worshiped you,

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:52.519
but then I saw you...

01:20:52.561 --> 01:20:54.396
with him...

01:20:56.023 --> 01:20:58.484
in your mouth.

01:20:58.525 --> 01:21:01.361
I couldn't let you
keep your tongue,

01:21:01.403 --> 01:21:03.489
not after that.

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.839
Jamie:
Larry? Oh, my God.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.301
Stop it.

01:22:47.342 --> 01:22:48.427
Stop.

01:22:56.101 --> 01:22:57.394
That was weird.

01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:59.271
Who is she?

01:22:59.313 --> 01:23:01.231
It gets confusing
at times, Brooke.

01:23:08.447 --> 01:23:11.366
I think
I should call the police.

01:23:33.222 --> 01:23:34.890
Larry?

01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:25.774
( Dialing )

01:24:25.816 --> 01:24:27.651
( Busy signal )

01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:52.301
Larry.

01:24:52.342 --> 01:24:54.052
( Busy signal continues )

01:24:58.182 --> 01:25:00.976
Through all the drama,

01:25:01.018 --> 01:25:03.937
whether damned or not,

01:25:03.979 --> 01:25:06.356
love gilds the scene,

01:25:07.524 --> 01:25:10.527
and women drive the plot.

01:25:12.154 --> 01:25:13.530
Come here.

01:25:18.744 --> 01:25:20.287
Come here.

01:25:24.082 --> 01:25:25.626
No. Let go.

01:25:32.216 --> 01:25:35.093
Damn cap
just won't stay in.

01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:38.680
Jamie. Jamie!

01:25:52.402 --> 01:25:54.321
Jamie.

01:26:12.756 --> 01:26:14.424
( Door rattles )
Let me in.

01:26:19.763 --> 01:26:21.181
Jamie,
are you in there?

01:26:22.516 --> 01:26:24.560
Jamie,
I know you're in there.

01:27:10.856 --> 01:27:12.399
Jamie?

01:27:14.610 --> 01:27:16.695
Open the door,

01:27:16.737 --> 01:27:18.822
just a crack.

01:27:18.864 --> 01:27:20.908
You stay away from me.

01:27:22.826 --> 01:27:25.370
- Jamie, open the door.
- No...

01:27:28.123 --> 01:27:30.459
All right.
Have it your way.

01:27:31.502 --> 01:27:33.253
( Skill saw buzzing )

01:27:35.672 --> 01:27:37.257
Don't you see it, Jamie?

01:27:37.299 --> 01:27:39.134
We're joined at the hip.

01:27:39.176 --> 01:27:40.969
We're Rob and Laura...

01:27:41.011 --> 01:27:43.096
We're peanut butter and jelly...

01:27:43.138 --> 01:27:44.681
We're Marge and Homer...

01:27:44.723 --> 01:27:46.558
We're green eggs and ham...

01:27:47.935 --> 01:27:49.353
We're corned beef...

01:27:50.395 --> 01:27:51.814
and cabbage.

01:27:51.855 --> 01:27:53.732
No.

01:27:53.774 --> 01:27:55.651
Open wide, Jamie.

01:27:57.861 --> 01:27:58.862
No.

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:35.399
( Opera music playing )
There we are.

01:28:43.907 --> 01:28:47.202
There we are. There we are.

01:28:48.245 --> 01:28:50.706
Do you have
any idea where you are?

01:28:54.209 --> 01:28:56.545
On the cutting edge.
That's where.

01:28:56.587 --> 01:29:02.926
On the threshold of a new
patient-friendly era of dentistry.

01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:05.971
Behold...

01:29:07.806 --> 01:29:10.893
...the dental environment...

01:29:13.103 --> 01:29:14.688
of the future.

01:29:20.527 --> 01:29:23.655
This is an empty room.

01:29:23.697 --> 01:29:26.241
It is not just
an empty room.

01:29:26.283 --> 01:29:30.454
It is a total
dental environment.

01:29:33.749 --> 01:29:37.753
Bathroom accidents, the greatest
cause of injury in the home.

01:29:40.339 --> 01:29:43.801
Wisdom teeth?
You're here for your wisdom teeth?

01:29:45.385 --> 01:29:49.056
I had my wisdom teeth
out years ago.

01:29:51.975 --> 01:29:55.771
Then we'll just have to do
a much better job this time.

01:29:55.813 --> 01:29:57.439
Won't we?

01:29:57.481 --> 01:29:59.191
Open wide.

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:15.040
You get away from me.

01:30:45.696 --> 01:30:48.824
Jamie.
Brooke.

01:30:51.493 --> 01:30:53.287
Jamie.
Brooke.

01:31:05.424 --> 01:31:07.968
Brooke.
Oh, my Brooke.

01:31:38.665 --> 01:31:41.210
( Ominous laugh )
Jamie.

01:31:55.974 --> 01:31:59.269
I know you're behind there.
Come out.

01:32:09.154 --> 01:32:10.989
Whoa, Matilda.

01:32:13.951 --> 01:32:17.496
I'm not Matilda,
and I'm not Brooke.

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:19.540
Gonna let you in
on a little secret.

01:32:21.333 --> 01:32:24.002
Killing is liberating.

01:32:24.044 --> 01:32:26.672
You just might like it.

01:32:26.713 --> 01:32:28.715
I can kill you with this.

01:32:29.758 --> 01:32:34.096
But what if it's not...

01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:36.890
plugged in?

01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.686
What if it is?

01:32:40.727 --> 01:32:45.107
Small town girl.
Nice, honest, small town little girl.

01:32:46.275 --> 01:32:48.193
You're not going
to pull the trigger.

01:32:49.403 --> 01:32:51.905
I'll tell you what:

01:32:51.947 --> 01:32:54.158
I'll give you to three.

01:32:55.492 --> 01:32:57.828
Then I'm going
to cut you a new smile,

01:32:57.870 --> 01:33:00.789
and start
to have some real fun.

01:33:00.831 --> 01:33:02.040
One.

01:33:04.168 --> 01:33:05.878
Two.

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:46.627
Surprise.

01:33:51.632 --> 01:33:52.883
They're new.

01:33:54.426 --> 01:33:56.428
I just bought them.

01:34:17.658 --> 01:34:19.034
Jamie?

01:34:20.327 --> 01:34:22.496
( Softly )
I'm over here.

01:34:22.538 --> 01:34:24.206
( Coughing )

01:34:28.460 --> 01:34:31.171
Are you okay?

01:34:34.091 --> 01:34:36.051
Where is he?

01:34:39.847 --> 01:34:41.765
( Laughing hysterically )

01:35:08.917 --> 01:35:11.378
That damned tooth.

01:35:23.015 --> 01:35:25.350
Stop. No.
Stop. No.
