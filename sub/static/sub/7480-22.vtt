Floyd Hobbs.

Grumpy retiree who

to call 'em,

05:05.655 --> 05:06.671
Brob.

05:06.673 --> 05:07.806
They've owned
the local bakery

05:07.808 --> 05:09.307
for the past
ten years.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.525
And last but not least,

05:10.527 --> 05:12.977
we have Brett Turner
and his fiancée Polina Grafetta.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.412
Aka the neighborhood
hotties.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.697
We scored an
invite to dinner

05:15.699 --> 05:17.198
at their house tonight.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.135
And I'm still trying
to find the whereabouts

05:20.137 --> 05:22.320
of our missing Russian
businessman Mikhail Kroyov.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.905
ERIC: Who happens to
be the only solid link

05:23.907 --> 05:25.156
we have to the sleeper agent,

05:25.158 --> 05:28.359
we believe is living
in the gated community.

05:28.361 --> 05:30.745
Unfortunately Kroyov vanished
before he could give up

05:30.747 --> 05:31.913
the sleeper agent's name,

05:31.915 --> 05:35.383
but we have footage of him
at an ATM ten days ago.

05:36.919 --> 05:37.685
Oh.

05:37.687 --> 05:40.722
Oh, my God.

05:40.724 --> 05:41.723
Yes, please.

05:41.725 --> 05:43.124
(all murmuring)
What the hell?

05:43.126 --> 05:44.476
Whew.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.693
Uh...

05:45.695 --> 05:46.761
This is not...
(laughs)

05:46.763 --> 05:49.380
I don't know where, why...

05:49.382 --> 05:50.798
That's, um...

05:50.800 --> 05:52.133
I think
I was hacked,

05:52.135 --> 05:53.768
so...

05:53.770 --> 05:55.636
Here's, uh, Kroyov's photo.

05:55.638 --> 05:56.604
(clears throat)

05:56.606 --> 05:58.356
Kroyov's claims
of a sleeper cell

05:58.358 --> 06:01.409
have been taken very seriously
by the DOD,

06:01.411 --> 06:03.244
particularly
since the exposure

06:03.246 --> 06:04.445
of the Russian
spy network

06:04.447 --> 06:06.981
in New York two years ago.

06:06.983 --> 06:08.116
SAM:
The agent has to have

06:08.118 --> 06:09.951
other contacts outside
of the community.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.819
Maybe it's time to visit
my old friend Arkady,

06:11.821 --> 06:13.004
see if he's heard
anything on the street.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.907
By all means,
call in all your favors,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.208
gentlemen.

06:18.043 --> 06:20.261
A-A word with you two.

06:31.273 --> 06:33.474
So, about what
just happened...

06:33.476 --> 06:35.026
Too soon.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.228
Got it.

06:40.816 --> 06:42.817
Wow.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.819
May I offer you a cup?

06:44.821 --> 06:48.072
Lapsang souchong
from the Wuyi Hills of China.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.523
No, thank you.

06:49.525 --> 06:52.227
Yeah, no, I'm good,
I actually prefer my tea

06:52.229 --> 06:53.578
in a bottle

06:53.580 --> 06:55.663
vacuum-sealed
in America.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.387
Why do I feel
like we've been called

07:02.389 --> 07:03.938
into the principal's
office?

07:03.940 --> 07:05.924
Have you done something wrong?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.176
Well, that could be
a trick question.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.727
No, we've done
nothing wrong.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.846
Not that we know of.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.147
Have we?

07:13.149 --> 07:15.316
Well, then...

07:16.969 --> 07:20.822
When two agents are forced
to live together undercover

07:20.824 --> 07:22.123
as man and wife,

07:22.125 --> 07:24.492
it's only natural
that the situation

07:24.494 --> 07:28.129
could bring about
unfamiliar feelings

07:28.131 --> 07:30.415
and emotions.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.700
You don't think

07:32.702 --> 07:34.502
that we're...?

07:34.504 --> 07:35.569
I mean, that
he and I...?

07:35.571 --> 07:36.771
(laughing)

07:41.010 --> 07:43.077
Not in a
million years.

07:43.079 --> 07:44.212
Okay, that's enough.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.413
You don't have
to insult your husband.

07:45.415 --> 07:46.547
I'm simply saying

07:46.549 --> 07:48.883
that such an intimate
assignment can impact

07:48.885 --> 07:53.972
the judgment of even
the most professional agents.

07:55.107 --> 07:59.344
You are up against a highly
trained Russian sleeper agent

07:59.346 --> 08:02.780
who will protect
his own identity at any cost.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.733
You need to be
at the top of your game.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.035
Right.
That's absolutely true.

08:07.037 --> 08:08.486
I understand, top of the game...
But I always feel...

08:08.488 --> 08:10.238
Hey, sorry to interrupt,

08:10.240 --> 08:12.156
but I think
you'll want to see this.

08:13.626 --> 08:17.929
ERIC (sighs): We found Mikhail Kroyov, our
link to the sleeper agent.

08:17.931 --> 08:20.798
This video was taken
at the Beverly Regis

08:20.800 --> 08:23.051
less than
an hour ago.

08:25.554 --> 08:26.754
Do we know where he went

08:26.756 --> 08:28.756
when he left the elevator?

08:28.758 --> 08:31.926
Actually, he never
left the elevator.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.240
ERIC: A
bellboy

08:46.242 --> 08:48.026
found Kroyov
a few minutes later.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.496
So the only connection
we have to the sleeper agent

08:51.498 --> 08:55.429
is dead.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.753
(gunshot)

09:09.510 --> 09:11.328
(sighs)

09:11.330 --> 09:14.114
Honey, I'm home.

09:14.116 --> 09:15.866
KENSI:
In the kitchen.

09:15.868 --> 09:18.585
What smells good?

09:18.587 --> 09:19.786
Wow.

09:21.088 --> 09:23.306
What do you,
what do you got there?

09:23.308 --> 09:25.258
Snickerdoodles.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.293
Are they
edible?

09:26.295 --> 09:27.627
Hey.

09:27.629 --> 09:31.164
What? You're not exactly known
for your cooking prowess.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.215
Okay, this is
happening.

09:32.217 --> 09:34.083
That and the fact
you tried to put tinfoil

09:34.085 --> 09:36.520
in the microwave
last week.

09:36.522 --> 09:39.556
I found a very easy Martha
Stewart recipe online.

09:39.558 --> 09:40.941
Really, Martha
Stewart?

09:40.943 --> 09:42.392
Ah, ah, ah.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.393
Ow, really?

09:43.395 --> 09:45.946
Any update
on Kroyov?

09:45.948 --> 09:48.982
Yeah, he was injected
with a fast-acting toxin.

09:48.984 --> 09:50.283
No I.D. on the killer.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.952
It sounds like our
sleeper agent woke up.

09:51.954 --> 09:53.486
Yep.

09:53.488 --> 09:55.705
Wait a minute, what are
you, what are you doing?

09:55.707 --> 09:56.656
Where are you going?

09:56.658 --> 09:58.608
This is for the old man
in 534.

09:58.610 --> 09:59.943
I figured he's lived here
forever,

09:59.945 --> 10:02.111
probably knows everything
that goes on.

10:02.113 --> 10:04.464
Only thing is,
he doesn't like people.

10:04.466 --> 10:05.448
Wait, so

10:05.450 --> 10:07.968
your plan here is
to ply him with your

10:07.970 --> 10:09.419
abundance of...

10:09.421 --> 10:10.420
cookies?

10:10.422 --> 10:12.005
Snickerdoodles.

10:12.007 --> 10:13.256
Uh-huh.

10:13.258 --> 10:14.391
Don't you have a jacket
or something?

10:14.393 --> 10:15.475
I don't need

10:15.477 --> 10:18.929
the whole neighborhood
checking out my wife.

10:18.931 --> 10:20.931
(door opens)

10:20.933 --> 10:22.666
(chuckles)

10:22.668 --> 10:24.300
Martha Stewart my ass!

10:24.302 --> 10:25.819
(door closes)

10:28.739 --> 10:30.907
SAM: You suppose Hetty gave
Kensi and Deeks the talk?

10:30.909 --> 10:31.825
CALLEN:
What talk?

10:31.827 --> 10:32.943
You know, the
talk she gives

10:32.945 --> 10:37.330
when agents go
undercover as a couple.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.999
Must have missed
that one.

10:39.001 --> 10:40.166
She never gave you

10:40.168 --> 10:42.752
the "intimate undercover
assignment" talk?

10:42.754 --> 10:44.838
"Unfamiliar feelings
and emotions""

10:44.840 --> 10:46.256
None of this
rings a bell?

10:46.258 --> 10:48.758
Nope, guess she thought I was
too professional to need it.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.994
Probably thought no one would get
close enough to you to have to worry.

10:50.996 --> 10:53.213
What, are you saying
that I'm cold and distant?

10:53.215 --> 10:55.331
Let's just say, if you had
an online dating profile...

10:55.333 --> 10:57.384
Which I would never do.
Probably wouldn't hurt if you did.

10:57.386 --> 10:59.803
But I don't... (rings doorbell)
But just for argument's sake,

10:59.805 --> 11:01.004
if you did...
There's no argument about it.

11:01.006 --> 11:02.272
I would never do that.

11:02.274 --> 11:03.673
I don't think that my soul
mate is a mouse-click away.

11:03.675 --> 11:04.975
Whatever.

11:04.977 --> 11:06.776
(sighs)

11:08.178 --> 11:11.281
So you're not gonna tell me now?
This.

11:11.283 --> 11:12.732
This is exactly what
I'm talking about.

11:12.734 --> 11:15.485
I don't know what you mean.
I know. Trust me.

11:15.487 --> 11:17.737
I know.

11:24.328 --> 11:26.413
Dobroye utro, my friends.

11:26.415 --> 11:27.831
What a surprise.

11:27.833 --> 11:29.082
You're looking well.

11:29.084 --> 11:32.902
Well, my doctor told me
to lay off latkes, join gym.

11:32.904 --> 11:35.088
I'm miserable.

11:35.090 --> 11:38.224
But you're not here to talk
about my health. What is it?

11:38.226 --> 11:40.260
A man was killed today.

11:40.262 --> 11:42.062
Russian businessman.
Mikhail Kroyov.

11:42.064 --> 11:44.380
Don't know him.
CALLEN: Yeah?

11:44.382 --> 11:46.116
Maybe you know some
of his friends.

11:46.118 --> 11:47.851
Here are some DMV photos.

11:47.853 --> 11:49.686
Bob Wright and Rob Nelson.

11:49.688 --> 11:52.072
Brett Turner and
Polina Grafetta.

11:52.074 --> 11:54.607
Serena Miller.

11:54.609 --> 11:56.359
Jane Felton.

11:56.361 --> 11:58.028
You know her?

11:58.030 --> 12:01.448
She resembles my ex.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.867
CALLEN:
Which one?

12:03.869 --> 12:07.454
The one who recently passed,
God rest her soul.

12:07.456 --> 12:09.172
Aren't they all dead?

12:09.174 --> 12:10.790
I do not have best luck
with women.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.158
Think how they feel.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.678
I do not like him.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.047
Just answer
the question.

12:17.049 --> 12:19.182
My last wife,
Natasha.

12:19.184 --> 12:23.053
This woman...
they could be sisters.

12:23.055 --> 12:24.954
Is she married?

12:26.474 --> 12:28.641
Sorry I cannot help you.

12:31.312 --> 12:33.780
Guy's hung up on his ex.

12:33.782 --> 12:35.815
I know for a fact
he hated Natasha,

12:35.817 --> 12:37.734
and she looked nothing
like Mrs. Felton.

12:37.736 --> 12:39.936
She was a six-foot tall
former Miss Ukraine.

12:39.938 --> 12:41.287
Why would he lie?

12:41.289 --> 12:43.490
He definitely reacted
when he saw these photos.

12:43.492 --> 12:45.458
Let me see them again.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.626
(sighs)

12:46.628 --> 12:49.779
Maybe he was reacting
to this woman,

12:49.781 --> 12:51.948
not to Mrs. Felton.

12:53.751 --> 12:55.451
"Serena Miller."
(phone ringing through)

12:55.453 --> 12:56.786
ERIC:
Hey, Callen.

12:56.788 --> 12:58.338
Eric, pull up
everything we've got

12:58.340 --> 13:00.390
on Mrs. Felton
and Serena Miller.

13:00.392 --> 13:02.342
Yeah.

13:11.769 --> 13:14.187
Mr. Hobbs?

13:20.811 --> 13:24.164
Mr. Hobbs,
my name is Melissa Waring.

13:25.449 --> 13:27.650
We're house-sitting down
the street for my uncle.

13:27.652 --> 13:30.453
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

13:32.039 --> 13:33.706
Well, okay.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.341
It's all right if you're busy.

13:35.343 --> 13:37.577
Maybe another time.

13:37.579 --> 13:38.828
I made you some cookies.

13:38.830 --> 13:41.047
I'm gonna leave 'em here
on your doorstep.

13:41.049 --> 13:43.650
Okay, enjoy.

13:47.922 --> 13:50.390
(car engine starting)

13:52.476 --> 13:54.677
(door closes)

13:57.948 --> 13:59.899
It's a start.

13:59.901 --> 14:02.619
NELL:
Hey, guys.

14:02.621 --> 14:05.171
Toxicology report's
back on Mikhail Kroyov.

14:05.173 --> 14:08.241
He died of a concentrated
cocktail of sodium thiopental,

14:08.243 --> 14:10.527
pancuronium bromide
and potassium chloride.

14:10.529 --> 14:12.195
Injection point
was the arm.

14:12.197 --> 14:13.780
Where the guy in the
elevator touched him.

14:13.782 --> 14:15.331
Anything on Jane Felton?

14:15.333 --> 14:16.466
She's a stay-at-home mom.

14:16.468 --> 14:18.434
Checks all the boxes,
nothing unusual.

14:18.436 --> 14:19.552
What about Miller?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.671
Mm, Serena Miller--
she's single,

14:21.673 --> 14:22.922
never married, lives alone.

14:22.924 --> 14:25.308
She works as a loan officer
at the Certified National Bank

14:25.310 --> 14:26.426
downtown.

14:26.428 --> 14:28.344
It's a good gig
for a sleeper agent.

14:28.346 --> 14:30.063
Access to personal
information and cash.

14:30.065 --> 14:31.881
Mm.
Keep digging.

14:31.883 --> 14:34.050
Roger that.

14:35.269 --> 14:38.822
So, I'm on, uh,
Romancing-The-One.com

14:38.824 --> 14:41.474
Same as you. Kind of
a funny coincidence.

14:41.476 --> 14:42.609
Ah.

14:42.611 --> 14:45.228
Um, my-my user
name is GeekToys82,

14:45.230 --> 14:47.063
in case you're
bored, and want to,

14:47.065 --> 14:49.532
you know, look it up and...
Yeah.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.534
...check it out.

14:51.536 --> 14:52.785
(sighs)

14:52.787 --> 14:55.238
Let's get back to work.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.172
That's a great idea.

14:56.174 --> 14:57.423
Okay.
Okay.

14:58.292 --> 14:59.709
Hey, Justin?

14:59.711 --> 15:01.577
Mm-hmm.

15:01.579 --> 15:03.463
What's this?

15:03.465 --> 15:06.382
Is that a trick question?

15:06.384 --> 15:10.553
What is my bra doing
in your sock drawer?

15:10.555 --> 15:12.689
I plead completely innocent,
but totally intrigued.

15:12.691 --> 15:15.141
Look, you are really testing
the boundaries here, buddy.

15:15.143 --> 15:16.359
Boundaries?
What are you talking about?

15:16.361 --> 15:17.760
We're married.
There are no boundaries.

15:17.762 --> 15:19.929
What's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

15:19.931 --> 15:21.865
No, no, boundaries are what
make a marriage work.

15:21.867 --> 15:23.733
Particularly when it comes
to sharing a bed.

15:23.735 --> 15:26.602
Yeah, about that-- I prefer
to sleep on the right side.

15:26.604 --> 15:27.987
No. We've talked about that.

15:27.989 --> 15:29.831
I can't sleep unless I'm
on the right side.

15:29.832 --> 15:31.808
Actually, you kind of
sleep in a diagonal,

15:31.826 --> 15:33.826
like a starfish,
with your arms out like this.

15:33.828 --> 15:35.178
You're kind of
taking up all four

15:35.180 --> 15:36.779
quadrants of the bed,
but I'm okay with that.

15:36.781 --> 15:38.915
You want to know why? 'Cause
I don't care about boundaries.

15:38.917 --> 15:41.751
So, if my wife wants
to spend the whole night

15:41.753 --> 15:43.452
hogging the whole bed,
snoring in my ear

15:43.454 --> 15:44.954
like an animal,
I'm cool with it.

15:44.956 --> 15:46.089
Hey, I do not snore.

15:46.091 --> 15:47.640
No, it's more
like a... like a

15:47.642 --> 15:49.759
snort-snore.
It's kind of a... (snorting)

15:49.761 --> 15:50.677
I do not do that.

15:50.679 --> 15:51.644
It's like a piglet.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.347
What?
(computer beeps)

15:54.349 --> 15:55.815
KENSI:
Like you don't snore.

15:55.817 --> 15:59.269
DEEKS: All right, Brett Turner's
background checks out.

15:59.271 --> 16:02.855
I don't know. There's something
still off about this guy.

16:02.857 --> 16:05.074
Is someone jealous?

16:05.076 --> 16:06.859
Jealous of what?

16:06.861 --> 16:08.711
I don't know. His
chiseled features,

16:08.713 --> 16:09.913
lean body, bulging biceps.

16:09.915 --> 16:12.465
I don't need to hate.
I got my own thing

16:12.467 --> 16:13.750
going on.
(phone beeps)

16:13.752 --> 16:15.335
Yeah, go ahead, Eric.

16:15.337 --> 16:17.203
ERIC:
Hey, I got an update on

16:17.205 --> 16:18.755
Serena Miller.

16:18.757 --> 16:21.374
According to her boss,
she's on vacation in Florida.

16:21.376 --> 16:22.926
Has been for the past week.

16:22.928 --> 16:25.511
Okay, well, then,
either her boss is lying to us,

16:25.513 --> 16:27.013
or she's lying to her boss,

16:27.015 --> 16:29.382
because I just saw her
drive down the street

16:29.384 --> 16:31.134
in her BMW.

16:54.658 --> 16:57.126
(birds singing)

17:11.175 --> 17:13.893
(gasps)

17:28.831 --> 17:30.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

17:30.801 --> 17:33.118
Okay, please, please
put the gun down.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.720
My name is Melissa.

17:34.722 --> 17:35.921
I'm just house-sitting
next door,

17:35.923 --> 17:37.806
and-and I heard
a scream, so I came

17:37.808 --> 17:39.975
in here to see
if everything was okay. Please.

17:39.977 --> 17:41.093
Please put the gun down.

17:41.095 --> 17:42.311
DEEKS:
You need backup?

17:42.313 --> 17:43.696
Yup.

17:43.698 --> 17:44.813
(car alarm sounds)

17:44.815 --> 17:46.565
(gasps, grunts)
(grunts)

17:48.234 --> 17:50.152
(grunting)

17:51.288 --> 17:54.573
(grunting)

17:55.909 --> 17:58.627
(grunting)

18:00.246 --> 18:02.614
(grunting)

18:02.616 --> 18:04.583
(sighs)

18:04.585 --> 18:05.467
(groans)

18:05.469 --> 18:06.885
(panting)

18:07.198 --> 18:08.948
Get up!
(groaning)

18:08.950 --> 18:10.700
Slowly.
(groaning)

18:10.702 --> 18:13.269
So much for backup.

18:13.271 --> 18:14.954
(groaning)
Special Agent Blye,

18:14.956 --> 18:18.324
NCIS. That's
Detective Deeks, LAPD.

18:18.610 --> 18:19.494
Who are you?

18:21.171 --> 18:22.587
I want protection.

18:22.589 --> 18:23.609
You pulled a gun
on a federal agent.

18:23.610 --> 18:26.110
I thought you were one of them.
One of who?

18:26.672 --> 18:27.956
Give me protection,

18:27.958 --> 18:29.074
and I will tell you everything.

18:29.076 --> 18:30.225
I'm not giving you anything

18:30.227 --> 18:31.576
until you tell me who you.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.762
My name is Serena Miller.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.414
And your real name?

18:37.233 --> 18:40.068
Nadya Borzov.

18:40.070 --> 18:42.754
A man named Mikhail Kroyov
was killed today.

18:42.756 --> 18:43.805
I had nothing to do with that.

18:43.807 --> 18:45.690
Then who did?

18:45.692 --> 18:47.192
My handler.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.944
He-he suspected
Mikhail was a traitor.

18:48.946 --> 18:50.278
We are not safe here.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.613
He knows I want out.

18:51.615 --> 18:53.281
He's gonna send
other people,

18:53.283 --> 18:56.567
other agents...
just like he did with Mikhail.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.752
Who's your handler?

18:57.754 --> 19:00.922
No more until
you guarantee me protection.

19:00.924 --> 19:03.541
I don't want this
life anymore.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.410
Please. I want a normal life.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.596
A family.

19:08.431 --> 19:11.266
I can't guarantee anything,

19:11.268 --> 19:14.102
but I can take you
someplace safe.

19:14.104 --> 19:16.421
I'll use her car, take
her to the boatshed.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.139
You run interference.

19:18.141 --> 19:19.391
I'll meet you there.

19:19.393 --> 19:20.725
Move.

19:23.479 --> 19:26.147
(barking)

19:29.285 --> 19:31.853
Down, Chewie.
Bad dog!

19:31.855 --> 19:33.488
(scoffs) Oh.

19:33.490 --> 19:35.824
Oh! I'm so sorry.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.748
He gets excited
every time he sees a cute guy.

19:37.749 --> 19:38.563
(Chewie whimpers)

19:38.588 --> 19:40.588
You're very naughty, but
you have excellent taste.

19:41.682 --> 19:42.764
(laughs)

19:42.766 --> 19:43.999
Oh, sorry.
I'm-I'm Bob Wright.

19:44.001 --> 19:46.167
I live right over there.-
- Hi.

19:46.169 --> 19:47.585
Uh, Justin Waring.
I'm house-sitting.

19:47.587 --> 19:48.837
Oh, I know.
Yeah, yeah.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.171
For the Colonel.

19:50.173 --> 19:51.840
I've seen you around the
neighborhood with that brunette

19:51.842 --> 19:53.558
with the legs
that don't quit.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.210
Sister? Friend?

19:55.212 --> 19:57.095
Uh, she's... wife.

19:57.097 --> 19:59.014
Ooh. All the good
ones are always taken.

19:59.016 --> 20:01.566
Speaking of the missus,
I... I really got to run.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.068
Oh, yeah.

20:03.070 --> 20:06.137
Sure. Hey, uh, you know, my,
uh... my partner and I own

20:06.139 --> 20:08.223
La Grand Baguette
up on Main.

20:08.225 --> 20:09.691
You should come by some time.
Okay.

20:09.693 --> 20:11.693
Yeah, I'll hook you
up with some muffins.

20:11.695 --> 20:14.079
Okay. Thank you for that.
Nice to meet you.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.081
(engine starting)

20:16.083 --> 20:18.917
Okay, you drive.
I'll give directions.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.953
Ow.

20:22.821 --> 20:25.006
Serena? Serena?

20:25.008 --> 20:26.675
(gasps)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:26.677 --> 20:27.876
Serena.
Help me.

20:27.878 --> 20:29.878
Are you okay?
Help me.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.213
Oh, Serena.
(breathing deeply)

20:32.215 --> 20:34.215
Deeks?
(breathing loudly)

20:34.217 --> 20:36.134
(gasping for air)
Deeks,

20:36.136 --> 20:37.969
Serena's down. She' shaving
some sort of seizure.

20:37.971 --> 20:39.354
You want an ambulance?

20:39.356 --> 20:41.139
(gasping for air)

20:41.141 --> 20:43.141
I think she's been poisoned.

20:43.143 --> 20:45.310
Serena? Serena,
who is your handler?

20:45.312 --> 20:48.113
Alex... Vasnev.

20:48.115 --> 20:49.614
Here.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.049
Here? Your handler is here?

20:51.051 --> 20:53.068
Alex Vasnev. Where?

20:53.070 --> 20:55.904
Serena? Serena!

20:58.524 --> 21:00.575
DEEKS:
Kensi?

21:00.577 --> 21:02.410
Kensi!

21:02.412 --> 21:04.462
We lost her, Deeks.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.881
Kensi, get out of there now!

21:11.637 --> 21:14.339
There's no record of Alex Vasnev
ever living in the neighborhood.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.307
Well, if Vasnev is
the Russian handler,

21:16.309 --> 21:17.592
he's probably living
under an alias.

21:17.594 --> 21:20.061
CALLEN: Or <i>she</i> is. Alex
could also be a woman.

21:20.063 --> 21:22.647
We need a log of everyone coming
in and out of the neighborhood,

21:22.649 --> 21:23.932
as well as everyone's
movements inside.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.066
Yeah. Eric's already going

21:25.068 --> 21:26.568
through the surveillance footage
up in Ops.

21:26.570 --> 21:28.069
What do we do about her body?

21:28.071 --> 21:29.654
HETTY:
We leave her.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.774
There's nothing that can be done
for that poor woman now.

21:32.776 --> 21:34.776
Best to maintain our cover

21:34.778 --> 21:37.312
and keep Serena's house
under surveillance.

21:37.314 --> 21:39.030
And if the handler lives in

21:39.032 --> 21:42.617
the neighborhood, Kensi
and Deeks will find him or her.

21:42.619 --> 21:44.202
Where are they now?

21:44.204 --> 21:45.537
Back at their cover house.

21:45.539 --> 21:47.789
You two gentlemen need
to find out

21:47.791 --> 21:49.074
why Arkady lied

21:49.076 --> 21:51.242
about Serena Miller.

21:51.244 --> 21:53.928
DEEK:
<i>She chose</i>

21:53.930 --> 21:55.580
her life just
like we do.

21:55.582 --> 21:59.017
Yeah, but all she wanted
was a family.

21:59.019 --> 22:01.636
I actually thought
I'd hate it here.

22:01.638 --> 22:05.473
A family, kids running around,
happily married couple thing.

22:06.758 --> 22:08.560
It's actually kind
of comforting.

22:08.562 --> 22:10.862
And it is nice
to have someone

22:10.864 --> 22:12.864
to say good night to
at the end of the day.

22:12.866 --> 22:16.234
What's happening here?

22:16.236 --> 22:17.485
Hmm?

22:17.487 --> 22:19.437
Kensi Blye going
all soft on me?

22:19.439 --> 22:20.738
No.
Next thing you know,

22:20.740 --> 22:22.240
you're gonna want little
kids running around.

22:22.242 --> 22:25.109
Little mutant ninja assassins.
Hey.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.112
What? I'm just saying that,
you know, for the record,

22:28.114 --> 22:29.547
if that's something
you want to do,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.949
I could help with that
from a technical standpoint.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.968
'Cause I am the husband,
which means that I have

22:33.970 --> 22:36.337
parts of my body
that are able...

22:40.125 --> 22:44.145
Mom!

22:44.147 --> 22:46.431
He's gonna need therapy.

22:53.022 --> 22:54.606
Visitors?

22:55.441 --> 22:57.108
Sam...

23:16.145 --> 23:17.712
(muffled screaming)

23:21.717 --> 23:22.517
Federal agents!

23:22.519 --> 23:24.552
(gunshots)

23:24.554 --> 23:25.386
Aah!

23:27.273 --> 23:28.223
Drop your weapon.

23:35.564 --> 23:37.765
(panting, coughing)

23:40.852 --> 23:42.904
How many times have I told you
not to lie to me?

23:42.906 --> 23:45.240
(laughs)
How many times do I have to lie

23:45.242 --> 23:46.875
for you not to believe me?

23:49.545 --> 23:51.629
It was not really lie.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.249
I didn't know her.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.252
(coughs)

23:57.254 --> 23:59.470
(speaking Russian)

24:04.810 --> 24:06.177
You done?

24:06.179 --> 24:07.312
(grunts)

24:07.314 --> 24:10.014
There, I'm done.

24:12.418 --> 24:14.435
Serena's father was friend.

24:14.437 --> 24:16.271
She wanted out.

24:16.273 --> 24:18.323
He asked me to help.
What did you do

24:18.325 --> 24:20.224
to help?
I put out word

24:20.226 --> 24:21.693
to my contacts.

24:21.695 --> 24:23.278
Her handler must have found out.

24:23.280 --> 24:24.362
Alex Vasnev?

24:24.364 --> 24:25.896
I don't know.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.532
This is not lie.

24:28.267 --> 24:29.584
I don't know who he is

24:29.586 --> 24:32.704
or how he found out.

24:34.657 --> 24:35.790
They work for him.

24:35.792 --> 24:39.127
Ask them.

25:00.207 --> 25:01.857
Polina, wh-what...

25:01.859 --> 25:03.075
what happened?

25:03.077 --> 25:04.577
Serena was found dead.

25:04.579 --> 25:05.878
No one knows what happened.

25:05.880 --> 25:07.746
Oh, my God.

25:07.748 --> 25:10.466
I know,
it's terrible.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.501
Apparently,
Chewie got off his leash

25:12.503 --> 25:15.421
and then ran into the garage
where the body was.

25:15.423 --> 25:17.840
(sighs) Really puts a damper
on our dinner.

25:17.842 --> 25:18.924
Yeah,

25:18.926 --> 25:20.593
it's not exactly
the greatest of timing.

25:20.595 --> 25:22.978
Well, come anyways.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.130
It will help take our mind
off all this.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.649
Brett and I are
looking forward to it.

25:26.651 --> 25:27.766
Yeah, no, of course

25:27.768 --> 25:29.852
we're gonna come anyways

25:29.854 --> 25:31.687
to the... yeah.
Okay, see you guys

25:31.689 --> 25:33.739
at seven.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.641
Does she model?

25:35.643 --> 25:38.894
I think Eric said
that she was a model.

25:38.896 --> 25:41.247
Yeah, cause that walk is

25:41.249 --> 25:42.615
all kinds of fantastic.

25:42.617 --> 25:43.949
There's Hobbs.

25:45.185 --> 25:47.203
I'm gonna go see
if he liked my cookies.

25:47.205 --> 25:48.954
Yeah, good luck with that.

25:48.956 --> 25:50.172
Excuse me.

25:50.174 --> 25:51.790
Yeah?
Can you tell me why you

25:51.792 --> 25:53.008
pointed a gun at my son today?

25:53.010 --> 25:54.760
(laughs)
Excuse <i>me.</i>

25:54.762 --> 25:56.428
You have some nerve

25:56.430 --> 25:58.931
accusing my husband of
something like that.

26:00.684 --> 26:03.502
Now, I don't mean to imply that
your son has a wild imagination,

26:03.504 --> 26:05.387
but he may have
been chasing

26:05.389 --> 26:07.389
some very scary cowboys and
Indians with his slingshot

26:07.391 --> 26:09.808
when he shattered
our bay window.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.528
Cody, is this true?

26:12.530 --> 26:14.230
Cody?

26:14.232 --> 26:16.732
DEEKS:
Cody.

26:16.734 --> 26:18.150
(chuckles)

26:18.152 --> 26:19.451
I'm sorry.

26:19.453 --> 26:20.953
I'll write you a check.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.938
He said there was a gun.

26:22.940 --> 26:26.242
Gas lighter for the barbeque.

26:26.244 --> 26:27.626
Grilling up
some ostrich burgers.

26:27.628 --> 26:28.961
Mmm.

26:31.882 --> 26:33.632
You are so grounded.

26:37.036 --> 26:39.889
Missed Hobbs again.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.560
Any luck on the guys
at Arkady's house?

26:44.562 --> 26:47.179
Uh, yeah, we got a
positive ID on both.

26:47.181 --> 26:49.148
First up is Sergei Dobrev.

26:49.150 --> 26:50.266
He's 25 years old,

26:50.268 --> 26:52.851
here illegally
on an expired student visa.

26:52.853 --> 26:54.153
Several known connections

26:54.155 --> 26:55.220
to the Russian mob.

26:55.222 --> 26:57.239
And Vasily Ikashev,

26:57.241 --> 26:59.108
28, big time mob enforcer.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.443
Long list of arrests
and misdemeanors.

27:01.445 --> 27:02.761
Any clue who they worked for?

27:02.763 --> 27:04.280
Not yet, and no connections

27:04.282 --> 27:06.031
to Mikhail Kroyov
or Serena Miller.

27:06.033 --> 27:07.950
But we did find
Vasily's address.

27:07.952 --> 27:09.485
He has an apartment
in Hollywood.

27:11.087 --> 27:13.339
What's with Deeks?
He's, uh, picking up Wi-Fi signals

27:13.341 --> 27:16.508
so we can snake the neighbor's
Internet connections.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.427
Is that a fanny pack?

27:18.429 --> 27:20.996
Yeah, he said something
about being Method.

27:20.998 --> 27:22.765
Okay, all right.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.517
DEEKS: Eric, tell me you got what you need.
Let's go check out that address.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.603
'Cause I've run up and down
this street, like, ten times.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.238
the neighbors are gonna
think I'm man-orexic.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.522
Hey, Justin.

27:30.524 --> 27:31.574
Yeah, I'm picking up
the last signal now.

27:31.599 --> 27:32.599
Hey.

27:35.094 --> 27:36.395
I want you to meet Rob.

27:36.397 --> 27:38.447
Okay.
So,

27:38.449 --> 27:41.784
your the neighbor Bob
won't shut up about.

27:41.786 --> 27:43.235
I'm Rob.

27:43.237 --> 27:44.870
Hi, nice to...

27:44.872 --> 27:47.489
I've been meaning to-to come
by the bakery, but...

27:47.491 --> 27:48.707
Ooh, just you luck.

27:48.709 --> 27:49.992
I have samples.

27:49.994 --> 27:51.160
You got to try these.

27:51.162 --> 27:52.611
Pomegranate macaroons.

27:52.613 --> 27:55.297
Chock-full of antioxidants,
so they're good for you.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.167
You want me to try
one of the samples right now?

27:58.169 --> 27:59.501
Okay.

27:59.503 --> 28:02.171
Something tells me he
doesn't eat a lot of sweets.

28:02.173 --> 28:05.624
(sighs) I swear I had a waistline
before we opened our bakery.

28:05.626 --> 28:07.009
Didn't we all?
You know,

28:07.011 --> 28:09.144
we would love to have you and
your wife over for game night.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.013
It's just, you
know, Charades,

28:11.015 --> 28:12.564
Trivial Pursuit,
Twister.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.433
Stop.
Twister, no, that's, um...

28:14.435 --> 28:15.567
Yeah, that's an idea,

28:15.569 --> 28:17.436
but I got to warn you
that, uh,

28:17.438 --> 28:18.604
Melissa's pretty competitive,

28:18.606 --> 28:20.155
tends to get
pretty vicious, so...

28:20.157 --> 28:21.940
Oh, well you tell her
to bring it.

28:21.942 --> 28:24.243
And bring her appetite
because I am going to make

28:24.245 --> 28:26.028
my dulce de leche cheesecake.

28:26.030 --> 28:27.780
You will die.

28:27.782 --> 28:29.198
I'll look forward to that,

28:29.200 --> 28:30.482
but listen,

28:30.484 --> 28:31.667
nice to see you again.

28:31.669 --> 28:32.918
High fives across the...

28:32.920 --> 28:34.570
See you later.

28:34.572 --> 28:36.372
(dance music plays loudly)

28:36.374 --> 28:38.457
Sweetie, I'm home.

28:40.543 --> 28:42.761
Are we having a dance party?

28:44.848 --> 28:46.849
Melissa!

28:46.851 --> 28:49.018
(music stops)

28:50.954 --> 28:53.138
Melissa!

29:21.200 --> 29:23.969
♪ ♪

29:28.058 --> 29:29.224
(gasps)
Oh, my God!

29:29.226 --> 29:30.893
What are you doing?
What am <i>I</i> doing?

29:30.895 --> 29:32.845
What are you doing?
You got techno blaring,

29:32.847 --> 29:35.013
there's blood running
through the entire house.

29:35.015 --> 29:37.099
It's like an episode
of <i>Dexter</i> in here.

29:37.101 --> 29:38.550
I cut my foot on some glass,

29:38.552 --> 29:42.121
and oh, my God,
what are you wearing?

29:42.123 --> 29:43.272
No, don't change the subject.

29:43.274 --> 29:44.606
I thought something
happened to you.

29:44.608 --> 29:45.808
Is that a fanny pack?

29:45.810 --> 29:47.092
No, it's a bro-sack.

29:47.094 --> 29:48.277
Don't do that.

29:48.279 --> 29:49.528
Don't scare me like that.

29:49.530 --> 29:50.529
Fine.

29:50.531 --> 29:51.897
Fine.

29:51.899 --> 29:54.466
(zipper noise)
What?

29:54.468 --> 29:56.702
I'm in a towel.

29:56.704 --> 29:58.404
I can see that.

29:58.406 --> 30:00.589
And you've seen too much,
so could you just leave, please?

30:00.591 --> 30:02.591
Want me to take a
look at your foot?

30:02.593 --> 30:04.376
No, I don't;
I want you to go away.

30:04.378 --> 30:06.345
I'm sensing a little hostility
here; you want to talk about it?

30:06.347 --> 30:07.412
You sense correctly.

30:07.414 --> 30:08.714
Now, some privacy please?

30:08.716 --> 30:10.332
And-and take that off.

30:10.334 --> 30:11.467
All right.

30:11.469 --> 30:13.251
(gasps)
Oh, my God,

30:13.253 --> 30:14.386
not your pants.

30:14.388 --> 30:15.521
What? Oh, my bad.

30:15.523 --> 30:17.222
Thought you wanted me
to take my pants off.

30:17.224 --> 30:19.475
I can't believe you just did that.
I'll see you later.

30:19.477 --> 30:22.478
Walking away, but doing it slow
enough so you can come after me.

30:22.480 --> 30:23.729
Want a little bit
of this action?

30:23.731 --> 30:24.947
That's so wrong,
I'm not even looking

30:24.949 --> 30:26.598
Come and get it.
I'm not even...

30:26.600 --> 30:28.283
I'm not even looking.
I see you peeking.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.368
I'm...

30:29.370 --> 30:31.703
Go away!

30:33.623 --> 30:36.241
SAM: <i>So, Serena Miller wants</i>
<i>out of the spy game.</i>

30:36.243 --> 30:37.576
<i>Calls her dad for help.</i>

30:37.578 --> 30:40.779
He then calls Arkady
to pull some strings.

30:40.781 --> 30:42.948
Mysterious handler
gets wind of it,

30:42.950 --> 30:45.801
sends his boys Sergei and Vasily
to take out Arkady.

30:45.803 --> 30:48.286
Serena's been a spy
for over a decade.

30:48.288 --> 30:51.173
Her handler wouldn't want
to lose such a valuable asset.

30:54.427 --> 30:57.479
Vasily sure lived
in a dump.

30:59.799 --> 31:01.567
I got something here.

31:05.555 --> 31:08.774
AK-47s, Makarov pistols...

31:08.776 --> 31:11.109
Standard Russian issue.

31:12.612 --> 31:15.414
It's time to tear
this place apart.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.669
Hey, any word
from Kensi or Deeks?

31:20.671 --> 31:23.205
Uh, ah, they're at dinner
with Brett and Polina.

31:23.207 --> 31:25.340
So, got you a
little something.

31:25.342 --> 31:26.542
Oh, yeah?

31:26.544 --> 31:28.594
Yeah.

31:29.712 --> 31:32.264
<i>46 Years of Football</i>
<i>Highlights..</i>

31:33.249 --> 31:34.600
I read on your profile

31:34.602 --> 31:37.002
that you love
football trivia, so...

31:37.004 --> 31:38.921
Okay,

31:38.923 --> 31:42.307
my sister wrote my entire page,
and she put some stuff in there

31:42.309 --> 31:44.593
that she thought guys
would like.

31:45.945 --> 31:49.347
So, you're really not into
buffalo-wing-eating contests?

31:49.349 --> 31:50.532
Mm-mm.

31:50.534 --> 31:51.567
Wrestling?

31:51.569 --> 31:53.936
Or, uh,

31:53.938 --> 31:56.371
football?

31:57.740 --> 31:59.925
What is the Super Bowl?

32:02.262 --> 32:04.463
Okay.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.147
KENSI: You sure
you don't need any help?

32:10.172 --> 32:11.421
No, it's all good.

32:11.422 --> 32:13.371
A couple more minutes, and
we'll be ready to eat.

32:13.373 --> 32:15.424
Okay.
Go have a drink, relax.

32:15.426 --> 32:17.175
BRETT:
My mojitos are the best.

32:17.177 --> 32:18.427
Trick is to muddle

32:18.429 --> 32:21.179
the mint before
you add the rum.

32:21.181 --> 32:23.265
Sweetheart?

32:24.684 --> 32:27.519
Cheers to new friends
and neighbors.

32:27.521 --> 32:28.654
KENSI:
Cheers.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.022
Cheers.

32:30.024 --> 32:32.991
Mmm, ooh.

32:32.993 --> 32:35.027
(coughs)
Hope it's not too strong.

32:35.029 --> 32:36.912
No. (laughs)

32:36.914 --> 32:38.247
So, tell me,

32:38.249 --> 32:39.781
how did you two first meet?

32:39.783 --> 32:42.000
That's a cliché story.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.702
We met at a gym.

32:43.704 --> 32:45.704
Actually,
it was an MMA gym

32:45.706 --> 32:47.205
in Chicago.
It was.

32:47.207 --> 32:48.323
Wow, mixed martial arts.

32:48.325 --> 32:50.459
I am impressed.

32:50.461 --> 32:52.261
No, you shouldn't be, really;
I joined with a girlfriend

32:52.263 --> 32:54.245
because she said it was
a great way to meet guys,

32:54.247 --> 32:55.330
and I think I, um,

32:55.332 --> 32:57.099
I went twice,

32:57.101 --> 32:59.051
including the time I met Justin.

32:59.053 --> 33:01.270
Mmm, so who made the first move?

33:01.272 --> 33:02.638
DEEKS: Actually, our trainers
introduced us.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.089
Mm-hmm.
Oh.

33:04.091 --> 33:06.508
But he was playing
Mr. Tough Guy, weren't you?

33:06.510 --> 33:09.094
I was just very into my workout.

33:09.096 --> 33:10.729
Right.
So I gave my number

33:10.731 --> 33:12.447
to someone else
to make him jealous.

33:12.449 --> 33:14.232
(laughs softly)
But...

33:14.234 --> 33:17.402
I knew it was meant to be
the moment I saw him.

33:17.404 --> 33:18.954
Here's a million
dollar question.

33:18.956 --> 33:20.489
Do you remember
what he was wearing?

33:20.491 --> 33:23.274
White T-shirt, red shorts,
black socks.

33:23.276 --> 33:25.577
Wow, that's actually
quite impressive.

33:27.497 --> 33:30.716
And Melissa--
what was she wearing?

33:30.718 --> 33:32.834
Are you trying to get me
in trouble?

33:32.836 --> 33:34.636
There's no possible way

33:34.638 --> 33:36.672
that I could
remember that.

33:37.507 --> 33:39.791
Black tank top, jeans,

33:39.793 --> 33:42.010
bag that goes across
your shoulder,

33:42.012 --> 33:44.229
hair down, wavy.

33:45.064 --> 33:48.150
Oh, you guys are too cute.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.985
Mostly her.

33:49.987 --> 33:52.104
So when did you first know
she was the one?

33:52.106 --> 33:53.605
(timer dinging)

33:53.607 --> 33:55.824
Oh, thank you for that.
Saved by the bell.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.776
POLINA:
Honey,

33:57.778 --> 34:00.529
why don't you take Melissa
into the dining room?

34:00.531 --> 34:02.080
Of course.

34:05.451 --> 34:10.288
Maybe you can give me
a hand with the food?

34:12.257 --> 34:13.992
What's that perfume
you're wearing?

34:13.994 --> 34:15.594
KENSI:
It's my favorite Chanel.

34:20.717 --> 34:23.217
(clears throat)

34:23.219 --> 34:24.686
All right.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.355
You've never played
an instrument before?

34:26.357 --> 34:27.606
No.

34:27.608 --> 34:28.940
You have great
hands for it.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.058
Thank you.

34:30.060 --> 34:32.561
POLINA:
Who needs another cocktail?

34:32.563 --> 34:33.779
KENSI:
Uh, I'm okay, actually.

34:33.781 --> 34:35.112
It's not like
you're driving.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.982
Sweetie, we need
another round.

34:36.984 --> 34:38.784
How about a red
from the cellar.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.036
Mmm. I'll get the glasses.

34:45.541 --> 34:47.775
I can't get a read on them.

34:47.777 --> 34:49.043
I can tell you one thing--

34:49.045 --> 34:50.411
that Polina's
got fantastic taste,

34:50.414 --> 34:52.362
because she really wants
a piece of your hubby.

34:52.364 --> 34:54.166
Yeah, well, if my hubby
weren't so self-absorbed,

34:54.168 --> 34:56.217
he would've noticed Brett's
hands all over me.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.336
Did you see the shoulder
rubbing with the hand thing?

34:58.338 --> 34:59.705
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

34:59.707 --> 35:01.056
No, I'm just saying
that they're trying

35:01.058 --> 35:03.008
to throw us off our game.

35:03.010 --> 35:04.276
You really think one of them
is the handler?

35:04.278 --> 35:05.710
Well, they are pushing the booze

35:05.712 --> 35:07.596
and asking us a whole lot
of personal questions.

35:07.598 --> 35:09.014
That's true, and every time
we ask them something,

35:09.016 --> 35:10.449
they do change the subject.

35:10.451 --> 35:11.800
Exactly.

35:11.802 --> 35:13.985
(closes drawer)

35:16.272 --> 35:18.740
Why are you staring at me?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.892
We're supposed
to be married.

35:20.894 --> 35:22.577
Husband's don't stare
at their wives.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.579
Just trying to figure out
where you hid your gun.

35:24.581 --> 35:25.697
Can you do it
without staring?

35:25.699 --> 35:27.206
You are carrying, right?
Of course I am...

35:27.207 --> 35:28.200
Then where are you carrying?

35:28.225 --> 35:30.225
BRETT: I guarantee you
will love this wine.

35:30.953 --> 35:32.788
Oh.

35:32.790 --> 35:36.541
Brett, we've got a couple
of lovebirds in here.

35:36.543 --> 35:38.910
BRETT:
That's the spirit.

35:38.912 --> 35:40.545
(nervous chuckling)

35:40.547 --> 35:41.630
Sorry.

35:41.632 --> 35:43.248
I don't know what
came over me.

35:43.250 --> 35:44.433
It must've been the cocktail.

35:44.435 --> 35:46.051
Ah, you're a
lucky man, Justin.

35:46.053 --> 35:47.418
She's a real live one.

35:47.420 --> 35:52.390
Yeah, no, my, uh, Aunt Hetty
definitely warned me about her.

35:54.143 --> 35:56.728
Can't find anything connecting
them to Serena or Mikhail.

35:58.848 --> 36:01.149
G...

36:03.786 --> 36:06.738
They've been made.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.093
A little top up?

36:18.095 --> 36:20.279
Oh, no, no. Otherwise I'll
never make it home.

36:20.281 --> 36:22.899
(chuckles softly)
That's the point.

36:23.901 --> 36:25.568
(phone ringing)

36:25.570 --> 36:27.320
That's my phone.
I better get that.

36:27.322 --> 36:29.205
You know, if it's important,
they'll leave a message.

36:29.207 --> 36:31.207
(ringing continues)

36:31.209 --> 36:33.125
So, Justin, tell me
about your work.

36:33.127 --> 36:34.660
You're an artist?

36:34.662 --> 36:35.962
That's fascinating.

36:35.964 --> 36:36.963
I love artists.

36:36.965 --> 36:39.465
Do you?
'Cause that's really...

36:39.467 --> 36:41.417
Yeah, it's actually
not that exciting.

36:41.419 --> 36:43.786
But what is exciting
is you and Brett.

36:43.788 --> 36:45.137
How did he proposed?

36:45.139 --> 36:47.840
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I almost forgot.

36:56.149 --> 36:57.466
(cork popping, Kensi gasps)

36:57.468 --> 37:00.102
A little trick I learned
down in Costa Rica.

37:00.854 --> 37:02.939
He's been practicing
for weeks.

37:02.941 --> 37:04.156
Save the champagne

37:04.158 --> 37:06.025
for dessert, sweetie.

37:06.027 --> 37:07.527
Let's give them the grand tour.

37:07.529 --> 37:10.496
Lead the way, honey.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.917
Let's start with the basement,
darling.

37:14.919 --> 37:17.253
(phone buzzing) Brett's got more
tools than Home Depot.

37:17.255 --> 37:19.338
I swear he would just
spend his whole weekend

37:19.340 --> 37:20.623
down there if I'd let him.

37:20.625 --> 37:21.991
KENSI:
Boys and their toys.

37:21.993 --> 37:23.509
POLINA:
Mmm.

37:23.511 --> 37:25.494
After you.

37:27.264 --> 37:30.016
POLINA:
Come on, guys.

37:30.018 --> 37:31.634
BRETT: It started out
as a wine cellar,

37:31.636 --> 37:34.336
and then I decided
just to go all out.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.771
It's totally soundproof,

37:35.773 --> 37:37.189
which is important in
this neighborhood,

37:37.191 --> 37:38.975
if you know
what I mean.

37:38.977 --> 37:40.342
You two wait right here.

37:40.344 --> 37:42.177
I've got a surprise for you.

37:43.947 --> 37:46.699
Kens.

37:50.988 --> 37:52.788
Ready?
Really?

37:54.524 --> 37:56.292
Go.
Federal agents.

37:56.294 --> 37:57.410
Raise your...

37:57.412 --> 37:58.694
hands.

37:58.696 --> 38:00.630
Oh...

38:02.382 --> 38:03.649
Role-playing.

38:03.651 --> 38:05.134
Huh? Attaboy.

38:05.136 --> 38:06.252
(growls lustily)

38:06.254 --> 38:07.703
I was thinking we...

38:07.705 --> 38:09.639
Quiet. I don't want to know
what you were thinking.

38:09.641 --> 38:11.874
Actually, I would like
to know what you were thinking.

38:11.876 --> 38:14.043
I mean, mostly out of
professional curiosity.

38:14.045 --> 38:15.394
I can read it
in the report.

38:15.396 --> 38:16.596
BRETT:
So, does this mean

38:16.598 --> 38:19.231
we're being charged
with something?

38:19.233 --> 38:20.516
Um...

38:20.518 --> 38:22.184
yes.

38:22.186 --> 38:25.021
You are charged with
undercooking the chicken.

38:25.023 --> 38:27.773
I'm not feeling very well.
I'm going to go home.

38:28.609 --> 38:30.359
Listen, Brett,

38:30.361 --> 38:31.560
you do some good work.

38:31.562 --> 38:34.480
I mean, this is some fine,
fine, fine craftsmanship.

38:34.482 --> 38:37.033
As much as I would like to stay,
'cause I really would like to...

38:37.035 --> 38:38.417
stay. I see you.
(growls lustily)

38:38.419 --> 38:39.568
KENSI:
Deeks.

38:39.570 --> 38:41.737
It's a pet name.
Rhymes with "freaks."

38:41.739 --> 38:43.089
Rain check.

38:43.091 --> 38:45.675
Wait, aren't you going
to handcuff us or something?

38:45.677 --> 38:49.161
Deeks!
Justin?

38:50.564 --> 38:52.798
(sighs)

38:52.800 --> 38:54.917
Okay, we need to talk
about that.

38:54.919 --> 38:56.352
You think?

38:56.354 --> 38:58.087
Who has a sex dungeon
in their house?

38:58.089 --> 38:59.588
Seriously,
who has the room?

38:59.590 --> 39:01.440
I'm not talking about that.
I'm talking about the kiss.

39:01.442 --> 39:02.775
The cover kiss?

39:02.777 --> 39:04.226
That's interesting tactic
for a cover.

39:04.228 --> 39:06.278
It worked, didn't it?
Yeah, well...

39:06.280 --> 39:07.897
Actually, what I want to know is
how you were two seconds away

39:07.899 --> 39:09.815
from being Polina's
whipping boy.

39:09.817 --> 39:12.652
I can think of a worse way
to spend a Tuesday evening.

39:12.654 --> 39:13.953
What?

39:13.955 --> 39:15.771
Kensi's private time needs
a little spicing up, does it?

39:15.773 --> 39:18.941
Hey, if you knew
about Kensi private time,

39:18.943 --> 39:20.326
your head would explode.

39:20.328 --> 39:22.378
Okay.
I can be sexy and wild.

39:22.380 --> 39:23.796
Of course you can.

39:23.798 --> 39:25.464
I can.

39:25.466 --> 39:27.449
Okay.
You don't believe me?

39:27.451 --> 39:28.834
All right, fine.

39:28.836 --> 39:31.787
I'm going to tell you a
little story, <i>but</i> no judging.

39:31.789 --> 39:33.005
No judging.

39:33.007 --> 39:35.290
Okay, so my friend
Monica and I,

39:35.292 --> 39:37.009
we met this guy
over spring break,

39:37.011 --> 39:39.128
and we both liked him, we
didn't think it was fair

39:39.130 --> 39:40.680
to make him choose
between us, so we...

39:40.682 --> 39:42.515
(metallic clicking)
Did you hear something?

39:42.517 --> 39:43.983
No, I think you should
keep going.

39:43.985 --> 39:45.601
Okay.

39:45.603 --> 39:47.520
Anyway, she was
really, really pretty

39:47.522 --> 39:49.321
and she had a body to...

39:49.323 --> 39:51.440
DEEKS:
Look out! Get down! Down!

39:52.509 --> 39:54.410
Oh, yeah,
we've definitely been made.

39:54.412 --> 39:56.145
Came from your one o'clock.

39:58.198 --> 39:59.699
(car alarm blaring)

40:01.785 --> 40:04.320
It's Rob and Bob.
I should've known.

40:04.322 --> 40:06.505
Their macaroons sucked--
no way they're gay.

40:06.507 --> 40:07.489
Cover me.

40:07.491 --> 40:10.376
Yeah. Ready?
One, two, three.

40:13.113 --> 40:14.430
Go! Go!

40:16.216 --> 40:17.516
Go!

40:29.446 --> 40:32.014
(gun fires twice)

40:39.906 --> 40:41.857
In here!

40:41.859 --> 40:43.659
Quick!
Cover me.

40:43.661 --> 40:45.711
One, two, three.
Go.

40:51.635 --> 40:52.835
Your cookies
were great.

40:52.837 --> 40:54.003
I'm Detective Deeks,
LAPD.

40:54.005 --> 40:55.871
This is Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

40:55.873 --> 40:57.757
Just stay down,
stay away from the windows.

40:57.759 --> 40:59.725
DEEKS:
We'll take it from here, sir.

41:00.977 --> 41:02.094
Deeks, kitchen.

41:02.096 --> 41:03.395
Drop your weapons.

41:03.397 --> 41:04.814
Drop them, now!

41:07.601 --> 41:08.934
(Hobbs cries out)

41:12.105 --> 41:13.856
On your knees.

41:13.858 --> 41:15.191
Put your hands up.

41:15.193 --> 41:16.742
Put them up!

41:21.748 --> 41:23.749
Clear.
Clear.

41:23.751 --> 41:25.584
Really?

41:25.586 --> 41:27.536
Bra holster?

41:27.538 --> 41:30.439
Really? Furry handcuffs?

41:31.208 --> 41:33.843
Little gift
from our friends.

41:34.711 --> 41:36.912
Get up.

41:36.914 --> 41:40.766
Floyd Hobbs,
real name Alexander Vasnev.

41:40.768 --> 41:43.052
According to records, he's
lived in that gated community

41:43.054 --> 41:44.553
since the '80s

41:44.555 --> 41:47.273
and helped new agents
assimilate into the country.

41:47.275 --> 41:49.942
Born a spy, die a spy.

41:49.944 --> 41:51.310
We know what spooked him?

41:51.312 --> 41:52.645
Probably Kroyov.

41:52.647 --> 41:56.432
Hobbs would have already known
someone was coming for him.

41:56.434 --> 41:58.117
And we were the new kids
on the block.

41:58.119 --> 42:01.103
Maybe Rob and Bob
saw me leave Serena's.

42:01.105 --> 42:03.155
Don't beat yourself
up, Mr. Deeks.

42:03.157 --> 42:04.940
Hobbs probably
had you marked

42:04.942 --> 42:09.144
the moment you put on
that bro-bag.

42:09.146 --> 42:11.413
(laughs)
Go home.

42:11.415 --> 42:13.315
Sleep.

42:13.317 --> 42:14.917
Preferably in your own beds.

42:14.919 --> 42:17.553
CALLEN: Good night.
KENSI: Night.

42:17.555 --> 42:18.671
(Deeks clears throat)

42:18.673 --> 42:21.390
So, you and Monica
met a guy...

42:21.392 --> 42:24.176
I do not want to talk
about this now.

42:24.178 --> 42:25.594
Maybe it would
be cathartic.

42:26.462 --> 42:28.514
Good night, Deeks.

42:28.516 --> 42:29.732
No, come on.

42:29.734 --> 42:30.850
Night, hubby.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.318
Wifey?

42:32.320 --> 42:34.186
Light of my life?

42:34.188 --> 42:35.663
Sugar bear?

42:35.664 --> 42:37.698
HETTY:
Oh, Mr. Deeks.

42:39.172 --> 42:40.404
