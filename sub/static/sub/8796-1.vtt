WEBVTT

01:58.096 --> 02:00.219
Thanks.

02:23.421 --> 02:27.206
- Is it OK if I smoke?
- Sure.

02:29.429 --> 02:32.597
My matches are all wet. You got a lighter?

02:32.725 --> 02:36.261
Yeah. It's here somewhere.
It's my wife's car.

02:36.396 --> 02:38.022
Ah, there we are.

03:21.582 --> 03:26.921
<i>I remember going on a school trip
to the top of the Empire State Building.</i>

03:27.423 --> 03:32.763
<i>When I looked down at the people
on the street, they looked like ants.</i>

03:32.888 --> 03:36.804
<i>I pulled out a penny. Some of us started
talking about what would happen...</i>

03:36.935 --> 03:40.685
<i>...if I dropped it from up there
and it landed on somebody's head.</i>

03:41.691 --> 03:46.154
<i>Of course I never crossed that line
and actually dropped the penny.</i>

03:46.281 --> 03:50.197
<i>I don't think Early Grayce
even knew there was a line to cross.</i>

03:50.995 --> 03:54.246
I mean the mind of a serial killer
as it relates to culpability.

03:54.375 --> 03:58.041
Someone who can't distinguish
between right and wrong is like a child.

03:58.171 --> 04:02.669
In law, he should be treated like a child.
He should not be in prison, or executed.

04:02.803 --> 04:05.176
There you go again.

04:05.306 --> 04:08.842
Next comes the part where
you blame misfiring synapses...

04:08.978 --> 04:11.517
...amok biochemicals
and horrendous childhoods.

04:11.648 --> 04:15.563
It's a fact. Most of these people
have severe chemical brain imbalances.

04:15.695 --> 04:19.646
Think I put enough tequila in?
The answer is research and treatment...

04:19.783 --> 04:22.987
...under hospital conditions.
Not the electric chair.

04:23.121 --> 04:27.536
That's great, Brian. Unless it's your
mother's head they find in the refrigerator.

04:27.669 --> 04:30.706
But executing the killer
would not bring my mother back.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.414
- Thank God.
- Oh, everybody's a joker.

04:33.552 --> 04:35.592
But it'd sure make you feel a lot better.

04:35.722 --> 04:38.391
No, actually it wouldn't
make me feel any better.

04:38.558 --> 04:43.021
Brian, the bottom line is
these people are evil, plain and simple.

05:02.090 --> 05:05.008
How 'bout a bowl of chili? A hot one.

05:07.972 --> 05:10.429
Be right there!

05:10.559 --> 05:12.968
Antichrist would be a woman...

05:13.105 --> 05:18.348
...in a man's body,
with seven heads and seven tails.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.527
Make that to go.

05:21.323 --> 05:25.453
Antichrist would be a woman...

05:25.746 --> 05:27.620
...in a man's body.

05:27.748 --> 05:31.748
Seven heads and seven tails.

05:34.842 --> 05:38.627
Antichrist would be a woman...

05:38.763 --> 05:41.137
...in a man's body.

05:41.267 --> 05:46.309
Seven heads and seven tails.

05:48.276 --> 05:49.854
Yeah!

05:52.406 --> 05:54.530
<i>I always knew I'd be a writer...</i>

05:54.659 --> 05:58.990
<i>...but there's a big difference between
writing a magazine article and writing a book.</i>

05:59.123 --> 06:01.876
<i>I know. I wrote a magazine article.</i>

06:02.962 --> 06:07.791
<i>Everything I ever wanted to know about
serial killers fit nicely on those four pages.</i>

06:10.263 --> 06:12.886
Brian, what are we doing here?

06:13.017 --> 06:18.226
Research. Come on, look at this place.
You'll get some great photos in here.

06:21.570 --> 06:23.859
This is where her nightmares began.

06:25.158 --> 06:29.786
Her father worked the night shift here.
Most nights, he'd take her with him.

06:30.749 --> 06:32.789
She was 11 years old.

06:41.555 --> 06:45.388
Of course, the bastard knew
that nobody could hear her screams...

06:45.518 --> 06:48.092
...over the noise of the machines.

06:51.693 --> 06:55.527
<i>The article got me a book deal.
A little cash up front.</i>

06:55.657 --> 06:59.656
<i>But, between the rent and the convertible,
the advance was gone.</i>

06:59.787 --> 07:02.410
<i>I owed a book and I was stuck.</i>

07:02.541 --> 07:07.334
<i>What little I knew about serial killers
I'd learned in a university library.</i>

07:07.464 --> 07:13.551
<i>The only thing I knew for certain was that
people didn't kill each other in libraries.</i>

07:15.391 --> 07:18.062
She murdered her first victim over here.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.939
They found him stuffed in the corner.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.647
They found her second victim over there.

07:28.033 --> 07:32.911
Can you imagine the rage and pain
she must have felt returning to this place?

07:35.751 --> 07:38.872
The victim returns
to the scene of the crime...

07:39.882 --> 07:41.922
...and becomes the criminal.

07:44.555 --> 07:46.595
Where did everybody go?

07:48.101 --> 07:50.141
I didn't take that long.

08:13.969 --> 08:16.009
Size seven.

08:17.390 --> 08:19.965
That's right, ain't it? Super size seven.

08:20.102 --> 08:23.603
Oh, Early, you're a specialist.

08:26.694 --> 08:31.357
- Happy birthday, Adele.
- Thank you, honey! These are beautiful.

08:32.785 --> 08:37.413
This reminds me of Cinderella when
the prince gave her his glass slipper.

08:37.541 --> 08:41.457
Except these ones are red
and they ain't see-through.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.163
And there's two of 'em. Is that my chili?

08:47.054 --> 08:49.094
Oh, honey.

08:50.016 --> 08:52.804
Happy birthday to me. Thank you.

08:57.443 --> 08:59.602
Tonight turned out to be interesting, uh?

08:59.738 --> 09:04.485
Those fascinating friends of yours
and their stimulating conversation (?) Oh!

09:04.619 --> 09:07.657
No, the warehouse. I'm not that stoned.

09:07.790 --> 09:11.456
Oh, the warehouse.
Actually, yeah, it was pretty interesting.

09:11.587 --> 09:14.672
It was definitely the highlight
of the evening.

09:18.388 --> 09:24.059
You know, just bein' there where it
all really happened. I could almost...

09:26.148 --> 09:28.188
Take your shirt off.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.735
Yes, ma'am.

09:35.744 --> 09:37.784
Come here.

09:48.719 --> 09:50.760
<i>(dogs bark)</i>

09:54.310 --> 09:56.102
Early!

09:56.230 --> 09:58.306
- Early!
- What?

09:58.900 --> 10:01.473
I'll be waitin' for you when you get back.

10:02.196 --> 10:06.147
<i>- Put your titty back up, Adele.</i>

10:06.284 --> 10:09.571
Oh, wait, I forgot.
Mr. Diebold stopped by yesterday.

10:11.124 --> 10:13.995
He said if we don't pay him
by the end of the month...

10:14.128 --> 10:17.083
...he's gonna kick us
the F-U-C-K outta here.

10:17.215 --> 10:19.789
- He said that to you? Cussed at you?
- Mm.

10:19.927 --> 10:21.968
- You gonna talk to him?
- Well...

10:22.097 --> 10:24.138
Shut up!

10:24.934 --> 10:27.853
If he comes back here,
don't you open that door.

10:30.775 --> 10:33.446
Suppose he hears me inside?

10:42.499 --> 10:45.869
I picked up some Chinese.
Did you hear from the gallery?

10:47.547 --> 10:49.588
Have you got your slides back?

10:51.970 --> 10:54.010
What'd they say?

10:54.766 --> 10:57.387
Oh, well, you know.
Same story, different day.

10:58.354 --> 11:00.263
They're idiots.

11:00.856 --> 11:04.986
Too graphic. Too overt.

11:05.154 --> 11:07.942
Not suitable for mass consumption.
I forget what...

11:08.075 --> 11:11.694
You don't wanna be suitable
for mass consumption.

11:11.830 --> 11:13.870
I know.

11:16.252 --> 11:18.578
It's just...

11:18.713 --> 11:20.754
Who cares anyway, right?

11:22.051 --> 11:23.879
Not me.

11:26.015 --> 11:28.304
Christ, I'm dying here, Brian.

11:28.518 --> 11:32.304
Why can't we get out of here?
Why can't we just get the hell out of here?

11:32.441 --> 11:35.193
Why can't we just go to California?
Why not?

11:36.612 --> 11:39.650
- Just like that?
- Yeah. Just like that.

11:41.494 --> 11:43.534
Yeah.

11:48.253 --> 11:51.670
<i>What the hell did I know about California?</i>

11:51.799 --> 11:55.668
<i>For some people, it was still
a place of hopes and dreams.</i>

11:55.804 --> 11:57.845
<i>A chance to start over.</i>

11:58.683 --> 12:02.516
<i>The idea was, if you could just get there,
everything would be OK.</i>

12:02.647 --> 12:07.809
<i>And if it wasn't OK there, well, then it
probably wasn't gonna be OK anywhere.</i>

12:19.294 --> 12:22.711
<i>Adele!
Whose car is that out front?</i>

12:22.840 --> 12:24.881
She's not here.

12:25.010 --> 12:27.169
Shit.

12:27.304 --> 12:29.547
Well, look who stopped by.

12:29.683 --> 12:34.013
And I ain't supposed to be at the parole
office till tomorrow. Two o'clock.

12:34.147 --> 12:38.016
You know, Early, you're supposed
to notify me when you lose your job.

12:38.152 --> 12:40.192
Yep.

12:40.447 --> 12:43.199
I stopped by the mirror factory today.

12:48.416 --> 12:52.082
- You left quite a mess behind there.
- That wasn't my fault.

12:53.006 --> 12:55.793
It's dangerous there
and they treat me like shit.

12:55.926 --> 12:57.255
Aaaw!

12:57.386 --> 13:01.052
Nobody ever has treated you right,
have they, Early?

13:01.433 --> 13:05.729
Your daddy was pickin' on you
when he threw you outta the house...

13:05.856 --> 13:09.807
...for stealin' the tires off his truck.

13:09.986 --> 13:13.190
The police were way
outta line when they...

13:13.324 --> 13:17.073
...kept you from beatin'
that bartender half to death.

13:17.872 --> 13:23.212
You know, Early, I bet the Lord's gonna
be pickin' on you come Judgment Day.

13:23.337 --> 13:27.004
Now, hold on there.
I ain't got nothin' against God, see?

13:27.134 --> 13:29.423
It's just the people he let get in there.

13:31.014 --> 13:33.054
What you lookin' for?

13:35.436 --> 13:39.934
That girlfriend of yours.
Not much for housekeepin', is she?

13:41.194 --> 13:44.730
Well, we's thinkin'
about movin', anyhows.

13:44.865 --> 13:48.449
Maybe down to Texas.
Get me a job in one of them offshore rigs.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.702
What are you talkin' about?

13:51.792 --> 13:53.452
Well...

13:53.585 --> 13:57.002
- You know you can't leave the state.
- Yeah, it's just...

13:57.132 --> 13:59.802
What you can do... is get a job.

14:01.305 --> 14:05.255
You be at this address.
Three o'clock sharp.

14:07.354 --> 14:09.394
What is it?

14:10.692 --> 14:12.732
<i>Janitor's job. </i>

14:14.947 --> 14:17.439
Well, don't wanna be no janitor.

14:18.076 --> 14:21.992
I don't give two shits
what you want and what you don't want.

14:22.207 --> 14:27.203
I'm tellin' you to be there. Or you
gonna be havin' dinner with the sheriff.

14:30.635 --> 14:32.260
You understand me, boy?

14:32.387 --> 14:36.517
You oughta try puttin' a bag
over your head for that cough.

14:36.643 --> 14:39.645
<i>- Works every time.</i>

14:39.772 --> 14:41.812
Peg-armed piece of shit.

14:47.825 --> 14:52.820
<i>She came back to the
warehouse her father molested her in.</i>

14:52.956 --> 14:56.492
<i>Why? Because this place is the catalyst.</i>

14:57.421 --> 15:02.000
<i>She needed to relive her own nightmares
before she could kill those men.</i>

15:03.846 --> 15:05.885
How are you, Sleeping Beauty?

15:06.766 --> 15:09.602
- I didn't have the heart to wake you.
- Thanks.

15:09.729 --> 15:12.565
- Oof, my head.
- Mmm...

15:12.691 --> 15:15.608
- What are you doin'?
- I sat down with your photos...

15:15.737 --> 15:17.943
- ...which are wonderful...
- Thank you.

15:18.072 --> 15:20.529
...and my tapes, and I started writing.

15:20.659 --> 15:23.447
- How's it goin'?
- It's the best stuff I've ever done.

15:23.580 --> 15:26.997
- And I think I know why.
- Why?

15:27.126 --> 15:31.589
Because, for the first time, I understood
that woman as a human being.

15:32.008 --> 15:34.761
I was walking where she walked,
where she killed.

15:34.887 --> 15:37.176
I was in her skin,
looking through her eyes.

15:37.432 --> 15:40.719
I think we got a book here,
with your pictures and my writing.

15:40.853 --> 15:44.188
- It's a book.
- A book on the warehouse murders?

15:44.316 --> 15:47.520
No, on some of the most infamous
murders in American history.

15:47.654 --> 15:50.359
I wanna go to where they lived
and where they killed.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.161
I want you to take the pictures.
I'll write the text.

15:53.328 --> 15:57.457
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about this!

15:58.334 --> 16:00.707
We can go through Tennessee.

16:01.505 --> 16:05.587
We could drop through Arkansas...
wherever the hell Arkansas is.

16:05.719 --> 16:09.220
There it is.
Then we can drop down into Texas...

16:09.349 --> 16:12.102
...and from there
it's a straight shot right into...

16:12.228 --> 16:13.770
- California!
- California.

16:13.896 --> 16:16.982
We don't stop till
we hit the fucking ocean.

16:17.276 --> 16:18.819
<i>Thank you!</i>

16:18.945 --> 16:23.193
<i>We don't have enough money,
but we'll figure something out, right?</i>

16:40.849 --> 16:43.258
- Hold on a minute there, boy!
- Shit!

16:43.394 --> 16:47.144
Goddammit, you're gonna
settle that rent here and now!

17:09.553 --> 17:12.045
I'm tired of your bullshit, boy!
I want my money!

17:25.657 --> 17:27.616
<i>Dipshit.</i>

17:30.290 --> 17:34.205
<i>- Son of a bitch! Come back here!</i>

17:35.087 --> 17:40.428
That's it! Tell him I want you both the fuck
outta here by Sunday or I'll call the police!

17:41.805 --> 17:44.296
Elvis, get the fuck off of him!

17:49.607 --> 17:52.063
<i>The ride share was my idea.</i>

17:52.194 --> 17:55.528
<i>I thought if we found somebody
who wanted to go to California...</i>

17:55.656 --> 17:58.231
<i>...they'd help pay for the gas.</i>

17:58.368 --> 18:00.991
<i>Carrie wasn't crazy about the idea...</i>

18:01.122 --> 18:04.326
<i>...but the Lincoln only
got eight miles a gallon.</i>

18:13.680 --> 18:19.222
- They say one day the whole thing...
- Is gonna slide right in the ocean.

18:20.314 --> 18:23.316
"Need somebody to share turns
at the wheel and expenses...

18:23.443 --> 18:27.608
...on a week-long, cross-country
tour of historic murder sites"?

18:29.451 --> 18:31.492
You've gotta be kidding.

18:31.621 --> 18:34.194
Who in their right mind
is gonna want to do that?

18:34.332 --> 18:36.705
- I would.
- Like I said...

18:36.836 --> 18:38.876
Hey, good luck on that thesis.

18:39.715 --> 18:44.379
Hey, uh... don't know where
personal office is at, do you?

18:44.513 --> 18:47.848
Personnel office is, um...
first door on the left.

18:47.976 --> 18:50.384
What, down there?

18:50.521 --> 18:52.561
Stinking bitch.

18:52.690 --> 18:54.730
Shit.

18:59.658 --> 19:01.698
Early!

19:13.426 --> 19:16.547
- How ya doin', momma?
- Fine.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.931
Boy, I'm tired. Dinner ready yet?

19:20.060 --> 19:22.349
Almost.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.520
Well, let me know.

19:28.613 --> 19:30.856
- Early.
- Yeah?

19:32.910 --> 19:38.155
- Will you tell me more about California?
- Yeah, I guess so.

19:38.918 --> 19:40.958
Let's see.

19:41.088 --> 19:46.546
One thing, people think faster out there
on account of all that warm weather.

19:46.679 --> 19:49.515
Cold weather make people stupid,
that's a fact.

19:49.808 --> 19:52.976
That explains why there's
so many stupid people round here.

19:53.104 --> 19:56.022
It sure does! You know what else?

19:56.733 --> 20:00.684
You never have to buy no fruit
on account it's all on the trees.

20:01.406 --> 20:04.443
And they ain't got no speed limits.

20:04.577 --> 20:07.698
I hear your first month's rent
is free - state law.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.702
So till we get settled, we'll just
move around from month to month.

20:11.837 --> 20:13.914
How'd that be with you, momma?

20:14.049 --> 20:16.088
Um.

20:16.926 --> 20:19.335
What are we gonna do out there, Early?

20:19.472 --> 20:23.091
The first thing is get us a couple of
six-packs of Lucky Lager...

20:23.227 --> 20:27.606
...and climb up to that famous Hollywood
sign. We're gonna howl at the moon!

20:30.779 --> 20:32.819
Yeah, just like that!

20:34.033 --> 20:37.035
I heard once that there
ain't nothin' on that ol' moon...

20:37.162 --> 20:41.790
...except some little golf balls
the astronauts left behind.

20:41.919 --> 20:45.787
Nah, that ain't right. That's bullshit.

20:45.966 --> 20:50.878
The government be sendin' people there
all the time. Just don't want us to know.

20:51.013 --> 20:53.303
Now, git!

20:53.433 --> 20:56.139
Well, let me know when you're finished.

20:58.232 --> 21:00.271
Shit!

21:27.353 --> 21:29.810
So what'd he sound like over the phone?

21:29.940 --> 21:33.061
He was real polite.
He kept calling me "sir".

21:34.321 --> 21:36.361
- I like that.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

21:36.491 --> 21:38.568
You should try it once in a while.

21:38.702 --> 21:42.915
I don't know. This is really weird.
We should have at least met them first.

21:43.041 --> 21:47.871
Beggars can't be choosers. They were the
only ones to answer the ride-share note.

21:48.006 --> 21:51.921
Oh, God. Please don't let them
be as boring as Brian's friends.

21:52.053 --> 21:54.296
Anything but that.

22:03.110 --> 22:05.482
<i>Early, we shouldn't be doin' this.</i>

22:05.612 --> 22:09.149
You know you ain't even allowed
to be leaving the state.

22:10.369 --> 22:12.528
And these people are strangers.

22:12.664 --> 22:17.374
What kind of people would stop at places
where other people got murdered?

22:18.129 --> 22:20.881
What if these people
are dangerous, Early?

22:21.008 --> 22:25.090
- They ain't dangerous, they're writers.
- Honey... Early Grayce!

22:27.141 --> 22:30.808
- Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
- Yeah, I did.

22:30.938 --> 22:32.978
I left him with the car.

22:33.775 --> 22:36.313
We're all straight now.

22:37.572 --> 22:39.861
- What is that?
- That's Lucy.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.400
- Huh?
- That's mine.

22:42.536 --> 22:46.370
What kind of cuckoo-brain
carries a cactus in her purse? Huh?

22:46.500 --> 22:48.908
I don't know.

22:50.923 --> 22:52.963
Straighten up.

22:56.722 --> 22:59.843
Oh, Brian. You've got to be kidding me.
They look like Okies!

22:59.976 --> 23:02.433
Oh, Jesus, they look kinda weird.

23:02.563 --> 23:06.064
- They can't have $5 between them.
- Smile. Let me do the talkin'.

23:06.193 --> 23:08.103
- Let's keep goin'.
- Lighten up!

23:08.238 --> 23:11.275
- How many times you gonna say that?
- As many times as it takes.

23:11.408 --> 23:13.448
Lighten up.

23:22.464 --> 23:24.505
- Early?
- Mr. Kessler?

23:25.885 --> 23:29.053
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. Nice to meet you.

23:29.181 --> 23:30.890
- You must be Adele.
- Yeah.

23:31.017 --> 23:32.928
- That's Adele.
- Nice to meet you.

23:33.062 --> 23:35.102
Hi.

23:35.231 --> 23:38.067
- Can I help you with your luggage?
- Oh, yeah.

23:41.030 --> 23:43.071
- I'll get these.
- OK.

23:50.835 --> 23:54.170
- Hi, I'm Adele.
- Hi, I'm Carrie.

23:55.091 --> 23:59.339
- Oh, I like your hair.
- Oh. Thanks. Thanks.

23:59.597 --> 24:01.804
Cos it... it's short.

24:01.933 --> 24:04.770
Oh, yeah. Well... Thanks.

24:17.663 --> 24:21.957
<i>Carrie was right. If you looked in
the dictionary under "poor white trash"...</i>

24:22.085 --> 24:24.956
<i>...a picture of Early and Adele
would have been there.</i>

24:25.089 --> 24:27.296
<i>But I knew if I was gonna
be a good writer...</i>

24:27.425 --> 24:29.466
<i>...I'd have to ignore the clichÃ©s...</i>

24:29.595 --> 24:32.348
<i>...and look at life through my own eyes.</i>

24:33.725 --> 24:35.766
- So, Early.
- Yep.

24:35.895 --> 24:40.689
- What do you do?
- Well, I... do some work at the, uh...

24:40.818 --> 24:43.440
Well, I did some work
at the mirror factory.

24:43.572 --> 24:47.358
Know what, Brian? One night
when we was stayin' up late...

24:47.494 --> 24:50.246
...we was talkin' about
how much bad luck...

24:50.372 --> 24:53.291
...he must have coming
from all those mirrors he broke.

24:53.418 --> 25:00.419
And I swear we came to 449 years that
it would take for him to work it all off.

25:00.553 --> 25:02.546
And he'd have to - after he died...

25:02.680 --> 25:07.724
...he's gonna have to keep comin' back
to earth over and over and over again.

25:09.106 --> 25:11.348
Karma.

25:11.484 --> 25:14.058
<i>- What?
- Karma.</i>

25:14.196 --> 25:16.901
You know, when you do
something bad to someone...

25:17.033 --> 25:21.531
...and fate pays you back
by something bad happening to you?

25:23.041 --> 25:24.785
Is that French?

25:26.045 --> 25:29.166
<i>We could stop somewhere
if you haven't had breakfast.</i>

25:29.299 --> 25:32.634
<i>It's like this, Brian.
I don't eat breakfast.</i>

25:32.762 --> 25:36.346
<i>It's because of what
he read in this book once, Brian.</i>

25:36.475 --> 25:40.475
That, um... folks needin' breakfast
is a myth or somethin'...

25:40.606 --> 25:43.442
...and it was put out by the cereal people.

25:58.922 --> 26:00.714
- Jesus Christ!
- Who are you?

26:00.841 --> 26:02.550
His parole officer.

26:02.677 --> 26:04.883
Oh, right. Talked to you on the phone.

26:07.224 --> 26:10.843
- What the hell happened?
- They say it's a torch job.

26:11.188 --> 26:13.810
- That sound like your boy?
- Yeah, could be.

26:14.066 --> 26:17.318
- Where would I find him?
- I don't know. Crazy son of a bitch...

26:17.447 --> 26:19.772
...was talkin' about movin' down to Texas.

26:19.908 --> 26:21.985
Without his car?

26:22.244 --> 26:26.457
What about the owner of the house,
this, um... Mr. John Diebold?

26:26.583 --> 26:29.501
- You know where he might be at?
- I don't know.

26:30.839 --> 26:34.458
I tell you what. He's not gonna be
too happy when he sees this.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.220
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

26:41.561 --> 26:45.311
<i>Early seemed harmless.
Primitive, but harmless.</i>

26:46.068 --> 26:52.404
<i>The fact was that he'd killed his landlord
less than an hour before we met him.</i>

26:52.535 --> 26:54.742
<i>He was even wearing the guy's ring.</i>

26:55.747 --> 26:58.120
<i>Who knows what he did with the finger?</i>

27:11.435 --> 27:13.308
Here you go, momma.

27:13.813 --> 27:16.185
- Oh, thank you, honey.
- Yeah.

27:16.315 --> 27:18.309
Look what I got! I got a camera.

27:19.028 --> 27:22.563
Who gets... Who gets the water?

27:23.701 --> 27:27.118
Here you go, Bri.
I got chips and some jerky here.

27:27.247 --> 27:29.490
If you want 'em, just holler.

27:36.635 --> 27:38.379
Just in case.

27:40.556 --> 27:43.013
<i>From the moment I began
working on the book...</i>

27:43.143 --> 27:46.513
<i>...I found myself asking
one question over and over.</i>

27:46.814 --> 27:50.861
<i>What's the difference
between a killer and any one of us?</i>

27:50.987 --> 27:53.989
<i>What was it they had... or didn't have...</i>

27:54.116 --> 27:56.905
<i>...that separated them from us?</i>

27:58.247 --> 28:00.406
The Novaks are long gone.

28:00.542 --> 28:03.627
But the white picket fence
they hired Michael Zeruba to put up...

28:04.004 --> 28:05.831
...is still here.

28:33.293 --> 28:35.749
<i>- The Novaks...
- Hey, you two.</i>

28:36.672 --> 28:38.832
Come on, show your love!

28:47.228 --> 28:50.930
The Novaks embraced the young drifter
as one of their own.

28:53.445 --> 28:56.815
The neighbors said
he was a quiet young man...

28:56.949 --> 29:00.995
...who was often seen pushing
the children on the swing set.

29:01.205 --> 29:05.073
Everything was fine until the day
the Novaks ran out of work for Michael...

29:05.211 --> 29:07.784
...and had to ask him to leave.

29:08.255 --> 29:13.334
How does a man get to the point where
he can kill a human being in cold blood?

29:13.471 --> 29:16.556
Early, could you move
out of the way, please?

29:23.359 --> 29:26.693
The first to die
was the nine-year-old daughter.

29:32.621 --> 29:36.668
Hi, I'm Brian Kessler. What's your name?

29:42.384 --> 29:44.212
Pa!

29:46.473 --> 29:48.513
Pa, where are you?

29:50.061 --> 29:54.143
Pa! There's somebody at the door
who wants to see you.

29:54.483 --> 29:57.320
<i>- What? Who is it?
- I don't know.</i>

29:57.446 --> 30:00.816
Afternoon, sir. I'm sorry to wake you. Uh...

30:00.950 --> 30:02.991
My name is Brian Kessler.

30:04.456 --> 30:06.614
I'm a writer.

30:06.750 --> 30:11.746
I'm workin' on a book on some of
the famous murders in American history.

30:11.882 --> 30:14.635
I'm sure you're aware
that this is the Novak farm.

30:15.553 --> 30:19.849
I was wondering if my girlfriend Carrie
could come in and take a few pictures?

30:20.227 --> 30:24.356
I'll walk around, tape some notes and
we'll be out of your hair in five minutes.

30:24.524 --> 30:28.059
I'd like to maybe just walk around
the house and get a feel for it.

30:28.195 --> 30:29.987
Goddamn ghouls.

30:30.407 --> 30:34.536
We drove all day to get here, sir.
I'd be out of your hair in five minutes, sir.

30:34.662 --> 30:36.869
Five minutes!

30:41.004 --> 30:43.044
Brian, come on.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.717
Let's forget about it. Come on.

30:49.890 --> 30:54.934
<i>At the time, I was angry that
Mr. Baxter slammed the door in my face.</i>

30:55.064 --> 30:57.307
<i>But it was just his way of forgetting...</i>

30:57.443 --> 31:01.655
<i>...of pretending that nothing terrible
had ever happened there.</i>

31:01.781 --> 31:06.029
<i>I guess it's only natural to try
and forget the bad things that happen.</i>

31:06.162 --> 31:08.202
<i>You never really do, though.</i>

31:28.817 --> 31:30.857
We've come 480 miles so far.

31:33.156 --> 31:36.194
- Not bad for a day's haul, huh?
- Pretty good.

31:37.328 --> 31:40.164
You got any family or friends
in California, Early?

31:40.290 --> 31:43.827
- No. Do you? You do?
- No, I don't.

31:46.173 --> 31:49.876
Do you have any friends or family
in California, Carrie?

31:50.012 --> 31:52.550
What? Um, no.

31:53.809 --> 31:54.972
No.

31:55.102 --> 31:58.519
Well, that's OK.
At least we all got each other, right?

31:59.358 --> 32:02.562
I mean, that's somethin'.

32:05.950 --> 32:09.735
My momma used to say that
when you have people around you...

32:10.122 --> 32:14.833
...it's better that you're not by yourself,
because when you're alone...

32:14.962 --> 32:17.168
...it's hard to develop your personality.

32:17.506 --> 32:22.669
With more people around you, it helps,
cos friends are really important and...

32:24.224 --> 32:26.347
- Thank you.
- Thanks, bro.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.479
We'll get the next one.
We gotta hit the sack.

32:29.856 --> 32:32.099
Let's go, momma.

32:34.946 --> 32:37.355
- Have sweet dreams.
- Night, Adele.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.659
Night, Early.

32:44.793 --> 32:48.708
That's funny.
I didn't know you were so prejudiced.

32:48.839 --> 32:51.925
Because I object to having
somebody take off their shoe...

32:52.053 --> 32:56.265
...and scratch their foot
while I'm eating... I'm prejudiced?

32:56.392 --> 32:59.927
He can't help the way he was raised.
I kinda feel sorry for him.

33:01.482 --> 33:04.056
You feel sorry for him. That's so sweet.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.441
Obviously you didn't get
a whiff of that sock!

33:09.075 --> 33:11.532
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

33:16.001 --> 33:20.131
30 bucks for a motel. For what?

33:20.299 --> 33:24.760
A lumpy mattress, a crummy TV
and a crapper? Don't think so!

33:24.929 --> 33:29.593
- Honey, sing me a song.
- I'm busy, momma. Just stay put.

33:29.853 --> 33:31.892
Please?

33:33.399 --> 33:37.065
OK, if you don't sing it,
I'm gonna sing it myself.

33:38.656 --> 33:40.566
# Do

33:40.700 --> 33:43.821
# Do your balls hang low?
Do they wobble to and fro?

33:43.954 --> 33:47.159
# Can you tie 'em in a knot?
Can you tie 'em in a bow?

33:47.292 --> 33:50.911
# And put 'em over your shoulder
Like a continental soldier?

33:51.048 --> 33:55.129
# Do your balls hang low?
Do your balls hang low?

33:56.054 --> 34:01.133
Honey... when we get to California, will
you take me to that Chinese restaurant...

34:01.269 --> 34:04.188
...where all them footprints
are out in front?

34:04.941 --> 34:07.978
Only if they let me put mine down, too.

34:11.282 --> 34:14.119
Pretty smooth how they stiffed us
on dinner, though.

34:17.958 --> 34:21.375
He didn't stiff us.
He paid for the gas, remember?

34:22.630 --> 34:27.009
Brian, I am telling you...
I am telling you they're almost broke...

34:27.137 --> 34:30.341
...and we are gonna end up
paying for the two of them.

34:32.936 --> 34:34.976
Don't change the subject.

34:41.031 --> 34:43.652
It is my favorite subject, though.

36:16.949 --> 36:18.859
- Morning.
- Morning, Early.

36:26.253 --> 36:29.754
- Breakfast?
- No, I don't eat breakfast. Never do.

36:29.883 --> 36:35.674
Um, sir? We don't have a liquor license,
so I'm afraid you're gonna have to...

36:35.808 --> 36:39.676
That's OK. I got plenty more
where this 'un come from.

36:59.797 --> 37:02.336
- Morning.
- Morning, Adele.

37:04.888 --> 37:07.047
You... You cut your hair.

37:07.183 --> 37:11.098
Early cut it.
He said it makes me look more pretty.

37:11.938 --> 37:14.146
And... I think he's right...

37:14.275 --> 37:16.684
...cos... he's right.

37:18.155 --> 37:20.528
<i>- Nice job, Early.</i>

37:20.658 --> 37:23.233
<i>You like to order some breakfast?</i>

37:25.457 --> 37:29.503
No, I won't be having breakfast
this mornin', thank you.

37:33.133 --> 37:35.886
Want some of this?

37:36.304 --> 37:37.883
- Finish.
- Thanks.

37:38.015 --> 37:40.387
What you readin'?

37:40.518 --> 37:44.683
<i>- Sex, Art, and American Culture.
- No, I never read that.</i>

37:44.816 --> 37:48.351
I can't wait to get on the road.
I love that convertible.

37:49.822 --> 37:52.444
- Yeah, it's great.
- Cos...

37:53.703 --> 37:56.158
...I like wind, Brian.

37:58.917 --> 38:00.958
So do I.

38:33.671 --> 38:37.837
- You want me to get your stuff?
- No. Thanks, Early, I can manage.

38:39.972 --> 38:42.890
I meant to say luggage. Ma'am.

38:58.872 --> 39:01.577
<i>- I got 'em.</i>

39:07.091 --> 39:09.500
- Hi, honey.
- Momma.

39:34.002 --> 39:37.039
<i>When you dream, there are no rules.</i>

39:38.090 --> 39:41.377
<i>People can fly. Anything can happen.</i>

39:42.764 --> 39:46.549
<i>Sometimes there's a moment
as you're waking...</i>

39:46.685 --> 39:49.972
<i>...and you become aware
of the real world around you...</i>

39:50.106 --> 39:52.183
<i>...but you're still dreaming.</i>

39:52.318 --> 39:55.522
<i>You may think you can fly,
but you better not try it.</i>

39:57.324 --> 40:00.944
<i>Serial killers live
their whole lives in that place...</i>

40:01.121 --> 40:04.123
<i>...somewhere between dreams and reality.</i>

40:05.126 --> 40:07.334
Guess it's your turn to pay, Early.

40:48.517 --> 40:50.095
Hey, move it.

40:51.521 --> 40:53.562
Stupid son of a bitch.

41:12.341 --> 41:16.007
You know, I used to smoke
before I met Early.

41:16.137 --> 41:18.177
But he broke me of that.

41:19.850 --> 41:22.852
- Broke you?
- Oh. Yeah.

41:22.980 --> 41:27.643
Cos Early, he don't think that women
should smoke or drink or cuss.

41:28.988 --> 41:31.028
So you know what I do?

41:31.157 --> 41:33.779
I spell all my cuss words.

42:00.070 --> 42:02.527
S... Ouch.

42:02.657 --> 42:06.490
S-H... Ouch! Owie.

42:14.799 --> 42:16.507
S-H-I-T!

42:26.397 --> 42:29.067
But you don't do
any of those other things?

42:29.902 --> 42:33.153
<i>No. I mean, I better not.</i>

43:08.536 --> 43:13.414
- He whips you?
- No, no, no. Only when I deserve it!

43:57.768 --> 44:00.889
- You were in there a long time.
- Yeah, I took a dump.

44:01.022 --> 44:03.561
You don't wanna go in there.
Wall-to-wall stink.

44:03.693 --> 44:07.561
- Just goin' in to wash my hands.
- Ain't got no sink.

44:07.698 --> 44:10.735
- No sink?
- No. Damnedest thing I ever seen.

44:11.828 --> 44:13.869
Let's go.

44:25.180 --> 44:27.219
How 'bout I drive, bud?

44:30.645 --> 44:33.979
- No, momma. Get in the back.
- $28.35, sir.

44:34.108 --> 44:36.350
- How much?
- $28.35.

44:36.486 --> 44:39.025
There. Hope I got that.

44:40.115 --> 44:42.156
Make it an even 30.

44:42.285 --> 44:44.326
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

45:05.692 --> 45:10.734
<i>When you first meet people, all you notice
is the differences between you and them.</i>

45:10.865 --> 45:14.567
<i>But, as time passes,
you start noticing the similarities.</i>

45:15.454 --> 45:17.744
<i>I guess that's how all friendships begin.</i>

45:17.875 --> 45:22.668
<i>OK, so you first. You put down
a card, and then I put down a card.</i>

45:22.797 --> 45:26.582
Then when they match up,
um... and it's the same card...

45:26.719 --> 45:29.045
...then you go "snap" and I take it.

45:29.181 --> 45:32.930
And I take the cards
that's there and... like that.

45:38.943 --> 45:41.103
Snap.

45:41.238 --> 45:44.406
I thought you said
you never played this before!

45:44.534 --> 45:48.830
I haven't. I really haven't.
I'm a fast learner, I guess.

45:49.083 --> 45:53.544
I was reading in your deal there how
they never caught that Black Dolly killer.

45:53.671 --> 45:55.297
- Black Dahlia.
- Yeah.

45:55.424 --> 45:58.794
- They didn't.
- Well, I was wonderin' how come.

45:58.929 --> 46:02.299
See what I'm gettin' at? It's like "Hmm."

46:02.433 --> 46:07.809
Well, some people think he just stopped
killing and disappeared back into society.

46:07.941 --> 46:13.067
That's fine and dandy, but I wanna know
what a smart fella like yourself thinks.

46:13.197 --> 46:15.440
I always thought
it was the work of a serial killer.

46:15.575 --> 46:19.076
Anybody who took that much care
bisecting another human being...

46:19.205 --> 46:21.578
- Bisecting?
- He cut 'em in two.

46:21.709 --> 46:24.876
- He hacked 'em up?
- In two pieces, yeah. In half.

46:25.005 --> 46:27.164
Anybody who did that
must have enjoyed it.

46:27.300 --> 46:32.093
He would have done it again and again
and again until somebody stopped him.

46:32.849 --> 46:35.519
That's good. That's a good theory, Bri.

46:38.607 --> 46:40.646
You wanna hear mine?

46:42.278 --> 46:45.399
- Sure.
- OK.

46:46.825 --> 46:49.068
Ain't you gonna record it?

46:52.041 --> 46:53.999
Uh...

46:54.127 --> 46:58.126
Early Grayce's Black Dahlia theory.

46:58.257 --> 47:00.298
June 23rd.

47:01.178 --> 47:04.512
OK. Now... I'm bettin' he's still alive.

47:06.017 --> 47:09.602
Real old, livin' in a trailer park
or somethin', somewheres.

47:09.731 --> 47:11.771
But he's alive, see.

47:14.278 --> 47:17.031
Now, he's thinkin' about what he done...

47:17.157 --> 47:20.693
...goin' over it and over it and over it
in his head, every night...

47:20.829 --> 47:23.403
...thinkin' how smart he is
for gettin' away with it.

47:23.541 --> 47:26.496
<i>- That's possible.
- You shoot pool?</i>

47:28.756 --> 47:30.879
<i>Hey!</i>

47:31.718 --> 47:34.674
<i>Hey!</i>

47:35.682 --> 47:37.722
Come on, bud.

47:38.686 --> 47:41.225
Designated driver.

47:41.356 --> 47:43.396
Minnesota Fats.

47:46.654 --> 47:50.950
- Don't forget your key.
- Why'd I open my big mouth?

47:52.829 --> 47:55.403
<i>Please come home soon.</i>

47:55.958 --> 47:57.999
<i>Let's go!</i>

48:01.215 --> 48:04.336
<i>Jesus, bud,
you damn near swallowed her!</i>

48:14.024 --> 48:16.183
So why didn't you go with them, Adele?

48:16.736 --> 48:18.528
Um...

48:18.656 --> 48:23.817
Cos, you know how, um...
Early feels about women drinkin'.

48:26.791 --> 48:29.247
So how did you and Early
meet, anyways?

48:30.128 --> 48:31.707
Oh, um...

48:31.839 --> 48:33.999
I was hitchhikin' this one day.

48:34.134 --> 48:36.923
And, um... Early stopped.

48:37.055 --> 48:40.840
And I walked up to look in the window.

48:40.977 --> 48:47.646
And I looked in, and Early's face,
he was down like that cos he was serious.

48:47.777 --> 48:51.361
And then he said "You gettin' in?"

48:51.490 --> 48:53.531
And, um...

48:57.498 --> 49:03.254
And, um... And then he looked up
and that's when I saw his eyes.

49:03.381 --> 49:07.462
And I swear, Carrie,
he has the eyes of an angel.

49:09.055 --> 49:14.182
And then, I just... I ended up
movin' in his trailer with him...

49:14.313 --> 49:16.519
...cos I thought it'd be kinda neat.

49:17.859 --> 49:19.900
But, um...

49:22.740 --> 49:28.033
Know what? I was thinkin' that
what if me, you and Brian and Early...

49:28.164 --> 49:31.616
...all moved into a house
together in California?

49:31.752 --> 49:33.792
Wouldn't that be fun?

49:35.716 --> 49:37.756
Well, I mean...

49:38.762 --> 49:41.680
Well, we'll see what happens.

49:42.976 --> 49:45.349
- You never know.
- OK.

49:53.823 --> 49:56.196
Do you want me to fix your hair for you?

50:00.081 --> 50:02.122
Yes.

50:03.127 --> 50:07.791
Cos, um...
I don't really like it... that much.

50:09.302 --> 50:11.342
Come on, then.

50:13.600 --> 50:16.555
- OK.
- It doesn't look that bad, but...

50:17.396 --> 50:19.437
...I think we should fix it.

50:26.033 --> 50:29.901
<i>I'm bettin' we gonna
find us some doors round here.</i>

50:30.038 --> 50:34.286
- Yeah, the door's out front, on the street.
- Not doors.

50:34.418 --> 50:36.459
Not doors, bud.

50:37.088 --> 50:40.375
Uh... Openings to other dimensions.

50:40.510 --> 50:43.049
Oh.

50:43.180 --> 50:46.182
- See... I read, bud.
- Uh-huh.

50:46.309 --> 50:49.928
And I'm tellin' you,
if a man knows what he's doin'...

50:50.065 --> 50:54.064
...he can transport himself to
anywhere in this goddamn universe.

50:54.195 --> 50:56.901
<i>Didn't know that, did you?</i>

50:57.032 --> 51:01.327
No, I didn't. Think I should tell you
I'm not much of a pool player.

51:01.454 --> 51:04.575
Oh, it ain't hard. I can teach you.

51:05.292 --> 51:06.788
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:06.962 --> 51:09.252
I'll spot you a few balls.

51:09.382 --> 51:12.503
- You're not gonna hustle me, are you?
- How much money you got?

51:19.395 --> 51:21.435
What's that?

51:21.606 --> 51:24.811
That's a portfolio of my work.
That's what that is.

51:27.113 --> 51:29.154
Your pictures? Can I look at 'em?

51:30.827 --> 51:33.069
Yup, go right ahead.

51:38.086 --> 51:40.127
Oh, my Lord!

51:43.886 --> 51:47.220
- Did you take this one?
- I took all of those.

51:49.602 --> 51:52.604
- That one's me.
- No, it isn't!

51:52.731 --> 51:54.771
Mm-hm. Hold still, you!

51:54.900 --> 51:56.940
Oh, I'm sorry.

52:00.407 --> 52:02.484
My God, Carrie.

52:02.619 --> 52:07.615
If Early ever saw me in a picture like that,
I'd be black-and-blue for a week.

52:14.301 --> 52:16.590
You shouldn't let him do that to you.

52:23.689 --> 52:25.728
You think Early's mean to me?

52:30.322 --> 52:32.362
Well, he's not.

52:34.327 --> 52:37.164
He may punish me once in a while, but...

52:38.876 --> 52:40.915
...he's not mean.

52:43.673 --> 52:45.714
Um...

52:46.761 --> 52:49.300
When I was 13, um...

52:52.810 --> 52:55.100
...there were these three boys...

52:55.230 --> 52:58.647
...and, um, they raped me
in the back of this truck.

52:59.402 --> 53:01.443
And...

53:04.368 --> 53:07.038
And, um...

53:07.163 --> 53:10.035
...they hurt me so bad that...

53:10.167 --> 53:13.252
...I was in the hospital for,
like, four months.

53:16.467 --> 53:20.382
And I feel safe with Early cos...

53:20.514 --> 53:23.266
...most of the time he treats me really nice.

53:25.103 --> 53:27.143
And, um...

53:28.148 --> 53:30.391
...I know that he'd never...

53:30.527 --> 53:34.146
He would never let anything like that
ever happen to me again.

53:40.206 --> 53:44.420
I like my hair.
You did a really good job, Carrie.

53:45.797 --> 53:49.297
It's, um... really professional.

53:56.520 --> 53:58.347
Hey, Marlene! Come here, baby.

53:58.522 --> 54:02.438
Why don't you and me get together
tonight and sweat it up some?

54:03.779 --> 54:05.689
Fuck off, TJ.

54:14.335 --> 54:16.625
There you go. That'll be five bucks.

54:20.009 --> 54:23.842
Wait. Wait a minute, wait.
These aren't Lucky Lager.

54:23.972 --> 54:26.927
- We ordered Lucky Lager.
- Take a look around you.

54:27.185 --> 54:30.722
If you see somethin' lucky around here,
you let me know.

54:35.488 --> 54:38.490
Why don't you tell me
what you think is so funny?

54:39.201 --> 54:41.871
- What?
- Do you think I'm funny?

54:41.997 --> 54:42.945
No.

54:43.082 --> 54:46.286
What would a jizz-garglin',
cum-drunk fairy like you...

54:46.420 --> 54:49.256
...do with a pretty girl like that, anyway?

54:49.382 --> 54:53.250
- What are you talkin' about, man? Relax.
- Hit him, Bri, cos it's comin'.

54:53.387 --> 54:58.929
- What was that? Is this your boyfriend?
- No, he's not my boyfriend. Just cool it!

54:59.270 --> 55:01.643
- Hey, asshole!
- This ain't Lucky Lager!

55:11.786 --> 55:14.195
<i>Break it up!</i>

55:14.332 --> 55:17.036
It wasn't that guy's fault. TJ started it.

55:28.016 --> 55:30.057
Dipshit!

55:36.361 --> 55:38.188
Rack 'em up.

55:38.530 --> 55:42.576
<i>Cos your pink replaces your red.</i>

55:44.955 --> 55:48.241
- My mom was a beautician.
- Really?

55:48.377 --> 55:50.749
Yeah. She likes pink a lot.

55:52.841 --> 55:55.083
You should have seen her face.

55:55.219 --> 55:59.716
She was mad when she first
found out I was with Early...

55:59.850 --> 56:03.469
...on account of him
just gettin' out of jail an' all.

56:05.482 --> 56:08.318
She hasn't talked to me
in over a year now.

56:09.237 --> 56:11.610
I wish she'd call me, Carrie.

56:11.741 --> 56:13.781
Early's been in jail?

56:17.081 --> 56:18.825
Uh-huh.

56:23.006 --> 56:25.045
What for?

56:25.926 --> 56:28.133
For carryin' a gun.

56:30.932 --> 56:33.471
And resistin' arrest.

56:34.354 --> 56:37.272
It's a really interesting story, actually.

56:37.399 --> 56:41.446
He put up a fight with the policeman...

56:41.572 --> 56:45.441
...and they struggled because
he didn't wanna be arrested.

56:46.328 --> 56:48.368
I'd have done the same thing.

56:51.001 --> 56:52.793
Why aren't you laughin' now?

56:54.130 --> 56:57.168
I don't know. I just don't think that...

56:57.301 --> 57:00.636
...carrying guns and resisting
arrest is very funny.

57:05.603 --> 57:07.644
Oh.

57:11.236 --> 57:15.816
Well... I'm gonna go back
to my hotel room now, Carrie.

57:23.043 --> 57:25.251
I had a really great time with you.

57:26.465 --> 57:27.460
Um...

57:27.591 --> 57:30.546
I just think I had too many beers.

57:33.474 --> 57:37.473
And I wasn't even supposed
to be drinkin' in the first place!

57:37.605 --> 57:40.441
Adele, you don't have to go.
I didn't mean...

57:47.826 --> 57:49.237
Great!

57:49.829 --> 57:51.988
Look at this dipshit.

57:53.209 --> 57:55.581
Hey, watch it, asshole!

57:56.171 --> 57:59.208
<i>- Get him, Bri! Tear him up!</i>

57:59.342 --> 58:01.381
Oh, I gotta see a man about a mule.

58:03.055 --> 58:05.049
What?

58:05.183 --> 58:07.223
Take a piss.

58:09.146 --> 58:12.267
Hey, see if there's any reebs
in the back seat!

58:12.401 --> 58:15.356
<i>- What?
- Reebs. Beers.</i>

58:16.489 --> 58:19.325
It's what we used to call 'em
when we were kids.

58:20.452 --> 58:22.446
It's beer spelt backwards.

58:22.580 --> 58:26.282
Shit! Think I chipped the concrete, Bri.

58:26.419 --> 58:28.661
The last one. I want you to have it...

58:28.797 --> 58:31.123
- ...for saving my ass.
- Don't want it. Take it.

58:31.259 --> 58:34.510
It ain't nothin'. I picked
that big Yankee mother years ago.

58:34.638 --> 58:36.881
But I'm not a mother and you are!

58:38.476 --> 58:40.517
Come on!

58:41.480 --> 58:43.521
Thank you.

58:46.905 --> 58:49.064
How long you had your woman, bud?

58:49.200 --> 58:51.525
- Three years.
- Yeah? She's a good one.

58:51.661 --> 58:54.331
She's a breeder, you dog!

58:54.456 --> 58:59.250
I'll tell her you said she's a breeder.
She'll like that. I'll tell her you said that.

58:59.379 --> 59:01.420
Can I get that, bud?

59:11.979 --> 59:16.478
Do you remember them doors?
Them doors I was talkin' about, Bri?

59:20.783 --> 59:24.734
I got me a couple.
I found me a couple of 'em in Kentucky.

59:25.915 --> 59:28.834
Hell, I wasn't even lookin'
for the first 'un.

59:30.379 --> 59:33.001
I was on the side of the road
swingin' my sickle.

59:35.177 --> 59:40.386
I turn around and there's this door.
This big ol' door.

59:40.517 --> 59:45.395
And light's comin' out,
blinding me, real gold.

59:45.524 --> 59:47.565
And I'm thinkin', this can't be.

59:47.694 --> 59:50.149
So, I close my eyes.

59:50.488 --> 59:53.526
And I count one,
I count two, I count three...

59:53.659 --> 59:55.700
...I count four, five.

59:56.204 --> 59:58.245
And I open my eyes.

01:00:01.587 --> 01:00:03.165
It wasn't there.

01:00:03.298 --> 01:00:04.460
Ha!

01:00:14.896 --> 01:00:16.936
<i>Come on.</i>

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:33.118
Am I late?

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:35.294
Sorry.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:40.220
Early and me, we...
we got into a fight in this bar.

01:00:40.848 --> 01:00:42.721
I'm fine, though.

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:45.851
It was just...
It was me and him against like, 30 guys.

01:00:46.104 --> 01:00:49.272
You and I, we gotta talk
about your good buddy Early.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.726
Who said he's my good buddy?

01:00:51.862 --> 01:00:54.567
You sure been actin' like you were.

01:00:54.699 --> 01:00:58.650
- Out whoopin' it up and drinkin'.
- You been drinkin', too. Come on.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:00.698
Oh yeah, right.

01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:04.996
You should have seen how scared
she was that he was gonna find out.

01:01:05.922 --> 01:01:09.506
- He beats her, you know.
- How do you know that?

01:01:10.595 --> 01:01:13.134
Because she told me.
That's how I know that.

01:01:15.852 --> 01:01:17.893
I gotta see a man about a mule.

01:01:19.482 --> 01:01:21.522
But only when she deserves it (!)

01:01:24.864 --> 01:01:27.356
Do you happen to know
that he was in jail?

01:01:27.493 --> 01:01:30.827
Yeah. Yeah, for stealing a car.

01:01:32.624 --> 01:01:35.330
Really? Is that what he told you?

01:01:35.461 --> 01:01:37.751
He told her it was for carrying a gun.

01:01:38.799 --> 01:01:41.635
Brian, it could be for murder
for all we know.

01:01:43.222 --> 01:01:46.473
Will you stop being
so fucking melodramatic?

01:01:46.601 --> 01:01:48.642
Melodramatic?

01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:54.694
If it was murder... he'd still be in jail.

01:01:56.531 --> 01:01:58.524
Or he'd be on parole.

01:01:58.659 --> 01:02:02.610
In which case, he wouldn't
be allowed to leave the state.

01:02:03.707 --> 01:02:07.956
<i>Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave the
state. Ever stop to think about that?</i>

01:02:09.923 --> 01:02:14.504
Oh. OK, we'll get the keys, we'll get the
car and sneak out. Is that what you want?

01:02:14.638 --> 01:02:19.266
<i>- What is the matter with you?
- Can we talk about this in the morning?</i>

01:02:23.609 --> 01:02:27.310
<i>- So how are you feelin' now, Brian?</i>

01:02:27.447 --> 01:02:33.404
Does your stomach feel kinda like
it's... in these knots and it's twisty...

01:02:33.538 --> 01:02:36.659
...and you could just explode
at any given moment?

01:02:37.877 --> 01:02:39.158
Well, um...

01:02:39.296 --> 01:02:43.295
My daddy, he used to make
this great drink for hangovers.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:46.927
And he'd make a blend of
sauerkraut juice and Tabasco sauce...

01:02:47.056 --> 01:02:49.096
Goddamn! You see that woman?

01:02:49.935 --> 01:02:50.931
She's butt ugly.

01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:56.402
And he'd put in... a little bit of lemon.
For the tartness.

01:02:56.527 --> 01:03:00.692
And then the last ingredient -
this is the best one - was an egg...

01:03:00.825 --> 01:03:06.116
...so that he could have breakfast and get
rid of his hangover all in the same time.

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:09.250
Shave that dog and teach it to hunt!

01:03:11.547 --> 01:03:13.540
<i>Early lived in the moment.</i>

01:03:13.675 --> 01:03:16.796
<i>He did whatever he wanted,
whenever he wanted.</i>

01:03:16.929 --> 01:03:18.970
<i>It was that simple.</i>

01:03:20.726 --> 01:03:24.345
<i>I don't know if I was fascinated
or frightened by him.</i>

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.604
<i>Probably both.</i>

01:03:27.901 --> 01:03:30.358
OK. What shall I call you?

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:34.575
I can't call you Lucy. Lucy's gone.

01:03:34.703 --> 01:03:36.612
I'll call you Shelly.

01:03:36.747 --> 01:03:40.497
Hi, Shelly. I know you're thirsty.

01:03:44.841 --> 01:03:47.250
What? What's goin' on?

01:03:47.386 --> 01:03:48.881
- Look.
- What?

01:03:49.013 --> 01:03:50.805
Look!

01:04:18.427 --> 01:04:22.011
Only thing my ol' man ever gimme
was this goddamn .45.

01:04:22.975 --> 01:04:23.805
Ha ha!

01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:26.303
Japanese, but it's pretty good.

01:04:26.438 --> 01:04:28.727
- Go on, shoot it.
- No, I never did this.

01:04:28.858 --> 01:04:31.350
- I don't know how to do it.
- Yeah, you can do it.

01:04:31.486 --> 01:04:34.488
- I haven't...
- Point and shoot the damn thing.

01:04:37.286 --> 01:04:40.122
No, bud, you're jerkin' it.
You're all like this.

01:04:40.248 --> 01:04:44.958
You gotta hold it soft -
like your pecker. OK?

01:04:45.504 --> 01:04:47.545
Boys'll be boys.

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:53.718
- You know any tricks, Carrie?
- No.

01:04:53.849 --> 01:04:55.428
Now hold on. Hold on.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:58.479
<i>-You wanna learn some?
-  No.</i>

01:04:58.606 --> 01:05:01.013
OK, loosen up. Loosen your elbow.

01:05:02.027 --> 01:05:05.278
Breathe. You gotta breathe, bud.
Hold it.

01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:07.031
Shoot.

01:05:07.158 --> 01:05:09.828
- Whoo! Hey, Carrie...
- Good one.

01:05:09.954 --> 01:05:14.452
- You look good with a gun, Brian.
- Good one, bud! Super. Good one.

01:05:15.711 --> 01:05:18.998
You like that gun? I'm gonna give
it to you. I want you to have it.

01:05:19.132 --> 01:05:21.921
- I don't need a gun.
- No, go on. Take it.

01:05:22.053 --> 01:05:24.094
I'll get me another one.

01:05:24.223 --> 01:05:28.886
You never know out in California - all
them cuckoo-heads. You best hold onto it.

01:05:29.020 --> 01:05:31.808
Now, give it another shot,
you mean boy! Go on!

01:05:31.983 --> 01:05:34.023
Shoot that damn thing.

01:05:35.738 --> 01:05:36.520
Ha ha!

01:05:36.656 --> 01:05:40.702
That's super.
That's some super shootin'. Look at that.

01:06:06.738 --> 01:06:11.200
Lewiston Abattoir Mt. Juliet, Texas

01:06:14.122 --> 01:06:18.251
Think we're gonna sit this one out, bud,
if that's to your satisfication.

01:06:18.377 --> 01:06:20.418
Fine.

01:06:23.093 --> 01:06:25.419
Early! Early...

01:06:27.014 --> 01:06:30.514
You need some help, bud, just holler.
I'll be there.

01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:33.268
<i>Ha ha!</i>

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.221
Shit.

01:07:43.449 --> 01:07:47.151
- What is that?
- A copy of the tape they found.

01:07:48.539 --> 01:07:50.579
He recorded everything.

01:07:54.088 --> 01:07:56.128
<i>Mister, c-can you help me?</i>

01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:03.056
His mother had him workin' in here
before he was eight years old.

01:08:03.183 --> 01:08:07.182
Killing animals with a sledgehammer
that was bigger than he was.

01:08:07.732 --> 01:08:12.276
<i>Look. Can you... Can you...
Can you get me out of here, please?</i>

01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:18.535
<i>Look. Look, I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you want with me, but...</i>

01:08:18.871 --> 01:08:20.911
<i>...please, just let me go, OK?</i>

01:08:22.207 --> 01:08:24.167
When she was pissed at him...

01:08:25.337 --> 01:08:27.377
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:08:27.506 --> 01:08:29.881
...she'd beat the shit out of him...

01:08:30.011 --> 01:08:32.764
...then lock him in here overnight.

01:08:35.559 --> 01:08:39.559
<i>My parents, they have money. I can
give you money if that's what you want.</i>

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:42.182
<i>- Please! Please let me go.
- One morning...</i>

01:08:45.657 --> 01:08:48.064
...the little boy wakes up...

01:08:49.161 --> 01:08:51.285
...picks up his sledgehammer...

01:08:51.413 --> 01:08:55.116
<i>- What are you gonna do with those?
- ...starts hurting back.</i>

01:08:55.252 --> 01:08:57.245
<i>No. No, no.</i>

01:09:06.015 --> 01:09:08.555
How does he get from...

01:09:08.812 --> 01:09:11.814
- What are you doing?
- I'm finished.

01:09:13.277 --> 01:09:17.774
- I know you're upset about the gun.
- I am not upset about the gun!

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:22.029
Yeah, I'm upset about the gun,
but that is not it. It's...

01:09:23.206 --> 01:09:26.078
God, can we please turn this off!

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.254
Goddammit, what is going on here?

01:09:35.139 --> 01:09:38.840
A week ago you would never
have picked up that gun. Never!

01:09:38.977 --> 01:09:44.221
And this afternoon you're wielding it
like you're Clyde fucking Barrow!

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.814
What is going on with you?
Please talk to me.

01:09:46.944 --> 01:09:51.075
It was stupid. It was a cheap thrill.
I admit it, it was stupid.

01:09:51.743 --> 01:09:53.987
It was just bang bang, like kids.

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.155
OK?

01:09:56.291 --> 01:10:00.540
But I need you to take these photos.
We need them. I don't wanna blow it.

01:10:00.672 --> 01:10:06.511
Oh, the pictures. The book. God, that
really is all that matters to you, isn't it?

01:10:07.390 --> 01:10:10.095
That really is all you care about, isn't it?

01:10:10.936 --> 01:10:13.475
God, I cannot believe I agreed to do this!

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:16.229
That is such crap.

01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:20.939
You know you wanted to take these
photos just as much as I wanted you to.

01:10:21.074 --> 01:10:23.115
Wrong.

01:10:23.244 --> 01:10:27.077
Wrong. I was willing to do whatever
it took to get you off of your ass...

01:10:27.207 --> 01:10:31.670
<i>...and us on our way to California,
and there's a big difference!</i>

01:10:59.042 --> 01:11:01.034
- Early...
- What?

01:11:47.522 --> 01:11:50.310
<i>Ow! Ow!</i>

01:11:51.068 --> 01:11:53.607
Early... wait!

01:11:58.537 --> 01:12:01.824
- Jesus Christ.
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:12:04.337 --> 01:12:06.376
I want him out of our car.

01:12:08.008 --> 01:12:11.010
- Why? What happened?
- I want him out of our car.

01:12:11.137 --> 01:12:15.266
- What happened?
- Next gas station it's either him or me.

01:12:41.386 --> 01:12:44.803
<i>...and forced 70 people
to evacuate their homes...</i>

01:12:44.932 --> 01:12:47.341
<i>...was originally thought
to have been arson.</i>

01:12:47.477 --> 01:12:53.933
Can I get a carton of Victory Kings
and $20 worth of gas in the car. Thanks.

01:12:56.113 --> 01:12:58.272
Here's your change.

01:13:00.035 --> 01:13:03.073
Looks like a bad one's coming in.
Y'all better be careful.

01:13:03.206 --> 01:13:05.413
Where you headed?

01:13:05.542 --> 01:13:07.583
California.

01:13:08.421 --> 01:13:12.421
California. I hear it never rains
out there, huh? Must be nice.

01:13:52.939 --> 01:13:56.143
Hi, Carrie. I have to go to the bathroom.

01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:15.627
<i>...fatal stabbing and robbery
of Joseph Davies Robbins...</i>

01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.169
<i>...at this east Texas gas station.</i>

01:14:18.306 --> 01:14:23.016
<i>He is armed and dangerous.
If you see this man, please notif...</i>

01:14:28.152 --> 01:14:31.070
<i>...with a history of arrests, is still at large.</i>

01:14:31.198 --> 01:14:35.362
<i>Grayce is 25 years old, 5'11",

01:14:35.578 --> 01:14:40.242
<i>He has a tattoo on his left arm. He was
last seen in east Texas at a gas station...</i>

01:14:40.376 --> 01:14:43.082
<i>- I ain't ridin' no bus, bitch.</i>

01:14:43.214 --> 01:14:48.292
<i>He is believed to be responsible for
the murder of his landlord, John Diebold.</i>

01:14:48.429 --> 01:14:52.262
<i>The murder occurred last Tuesday.
We would like to repeat:</i>

01:14:52.392 --> 01:14:55.513
<i>- ...a nationwide manhunt is on for Grayce.
- Siddown!</i>

01:14:55.647 --> 01:14:58.399
I knew that boy would
have a hog leg here somewhere.

01:14:58.526 --> 01:15:01.018
Not a word.

01:15:03.949 --> 01:15:07.284
Hello. Get over here, skinny.
Sit your ass in that corner.

01:15:07.663 --> 01:15:09.702
Come on!

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.756
- Honey, what are you doing?
- They gave us the boot, momma.

01:15:20.096 --> 01:15:22.552
Keep Brian busy.
I don't want him comin' in.

01:15:22.683 --> 01:15:25.055
- You're scaring...
- Not now! Git!

01:15:35.742 --> 01:15:37.366
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:15:37.493 --> 01:15:41.195
I'm-I'm just gettin' my things
and then I'm gonna leave, Brian.

01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:45.953
- What's your name, boy?
- Walter L-Livesy.

01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:50.633
Well, I think I gotta kill you, Walter.
How you feel about that?

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.257
Not so good.

01:15:54.391 --> 01:15:57.097
- Are you sure you have to?
- Don't know. Wish I did.

01:15:57.687 --> 01:15:59.645
- Early, please be...
- Shut up!

01:16:00.816 --> 01:16:05.396
Goddammit! I'm trying to have
a conversation with Walter!

01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:10.241
Sorry about that, Walter.

01:16:10.496 --> 01:16:12.988
Hey, don't forget your yo-yo.

01:16:13.625 --> 01:16:19.250
Adele, you leaving has nothing to do with
you guys. It's between Carrie and me.

01:16:20.634 --> 01:16:22.462
Where you from?

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:27.264
- Vernon. Florida.
- Don't know it. Any huntin'?

01:16:29.479 --> 01:16:31.936
- Turkeys sometimes.
- Huh.

01:16:32.066 --> 01:16:36.017
Yeah, turkeys are real smart.
Smarter than most people think.

01:16:37.741 --> 01:16:41.407
Tell you what, Walter.
I want you down on your belly.

01:16:41.537 --> 01:16:43.328
Get on your belly!

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:47.878
I want you to stay there
for a long time after we leave.

01:16:48.004 --> 01:16:50.044
- We got a deal, son?
- Yeah. Yes, sir.

01:16:50.299 --> 01:16:52.126
OK.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:54.549
You mind if I hold onto
that Bible over there?

01:16:54.679 --> 01:16:58.345
What do you want
with a Bible, Walter? Huh?

01:16:58.684 --> 01:17:00.678
He thinks I'm gonna kill him.

01:17:00.812 --> 01:17:03.351
- Now that'd make me a liar, wouldn't it?
- No, sir.

01:17:03.483 --> 01:17:05.523
No?

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:11.694
There you go, Walter.

01:17:13.454 --> 01:17:15.282
Hey!

01:17:16.083 --> 01:17:19.168
I wonder if Adele might want it. Ahh!

01:17:24.052 --> 01:17:26.092
- What was that?
- Oh, my God.

01:17:26.304 --> 01:17:28.345
Nothin', Brian. Just the thunder.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:37.939
- Hey, Early! What the fuck are you doing?
- You're gonna like this one, Brian.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:41.648
Get in there. Get over there.
Adele, you're drivin'.

01:17:41.867 --> 01:17:44.405
- What are you doin'?
- Come on. Let's go.

01:17:49.377 --> 01:17:53.506
- You all right? What happened?
- Get us out of here, momma.

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:03.971
- What happened?
- He shot him in the head. He shot him.

01:18:04.104 --> 01:18:06.430
No, no. No, he didn't!

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:12.311
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Everybody just shut up.

01:18:13.659 --> 01:18:18.073
Goddamn squawkin' hen.
Nothin's changed.

01:18:18.248 --> 01:18:21.535
I'm gonna get you there,
safe, to California...

01:18:21.669 --> 01:18:25.170
<i>...if Adele don't kill us
with her drivin' first! </i>

01:18:41.989 --> 01:18:44.028
Early!

01:18:45.076 --> 01:18:48.327
- Early!
- What'd you get us?

01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:52.373
I got Chinese food.

01:18:55.631 --> 01:18:57.708
What is it?

01:18:57.843 --> 01:19:02.304
The guy, he didn't speak too good
English, Early, so I just got what they had.

01:19:02.432 --> 01:19:04.758
Smells like butt. Did you get the beer?

01:19:07.439 --> 01:19:09.765
What is it, Chink beer?

01:19:09.901 --> 01:19:11.940
Goddammit, Adele.

01:19:14.531 --> 01:19:18.530
Well... give this one to whatshername.

01:19:18.661 --> 01:19:21.118
Come over here, bud.
Get you some grub.

01:19:21.248 --> 01:19:25.746
What the hell's a Chinaman doin' in the
middle of an American desert anyhow?

01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:28.336
Adele, where are the forks and spoons?

01:19:36.602 --> 01:19:41.645
Is it just me, or has this trip gone downhill
since we ran out of Lucky Lager?

01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:50.448
Wish I had me some chili beans.

01:20:01.385 --> 01:20:04.091
How many people have you killed, Early?

01:20:06.517 --> 01:20:09.887
Well, now, how many people
you seen me kill, Bri?

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:14.274
- None.
- That's how many I killed.

01:20:18.825 --> 01:20:21.661
- If you say so.
- Damn right I do!

01:20:22.747 --> 01:20:24.787
Shut up! Eat your food.

01:20:32.217 --> 01:20:35.255
You ain't never killed no one,
have you, Bri?

01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:40.517
- No.
- No. Ain't seen nobody killed, have you?

01:20:42.899 --> 01:20:44.808
- No, I haven't.
- No.

01:20:46.695 --> 01:20:49.448
Tell me somethin'.
How you gonna write a book...

01:20:49.574 --> 01:20:52.695
...about somethin'
you don't know nothin' about?

01:20:55.249 --> 01:20:58.619
Momma, sing us a song or... somethin'.

01:21:01.549 --> 01:21:03.588
<i>Oh. Um...</i>

01:21:05.303 --> 01:21:07.343
Um...

01:21:10.268 --> 01:21:12.308
# I

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.472
# Wish

01:21:15.608 --> 01:21:20.403
# Carrie was happy

01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:24.159
# I

01:21:24.287 --> 01:21:26.411
# Wish

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:31.701
# She would smile

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:50.768
You guys want your picture taken?

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:53.817
Come on, Carrie, smile.

01:22:07.386 --> 01:22:10.553
He was breathin'
when I walked out of there.

01:22:10.682 --> 01:22:13.434
See, Carrie, it's OK. He was breathin'.

01:22:15.229 --> 01:22:18.017
Ain't we gettin' near
the next murder site, Bri?

01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:22.019
- Forget it. It doesn't matter any more.
- Hell if it don't!

01:22:22.155 --> 01:22:24.195
Gimme that map.

01:22:26.619 --> 01:22:29.870
Someday, me and Adele,
we'll be walkin' along...

01:22:29.999 --> 01:22:32.538
...see your book in some store window.

01:22:32.669 --> 01:22:36.798
We're gonna buy it and put it on our
coffee table, ain't that right, momma?

01:22:37.341 --> 01:22:41.721
Davidson Mine Dew Cove, Nevada

01:22:50.484 --> 01:22:52.810
OK, let's go have us a look, people.

01:22:52.945 --> 01:22:56.731
- Early, I'm just gonna stay here.
- You don't wanna go, momma?

01:22:57.118 --> 01:22:58.743
No?

01:23:00.873 --> 01:23:04.824
All right, you watch Carrie.
I'll take the pictures, Bri.

01:23:13.807 --> 01:23:16.892
You run and Bri gets it. Karma.

01:23:19.815 --> 01:23:21.855
Lead the way, bud.

01:23:52.567 --> 01:23:55.273
So, um, uh... what happened here?

01:23:56.572 --> 01:23:59.609
Two brothers, prospectors,
lived here in the '70s.

01:24:00.994 --> 01:24:02.988
Yeah, so?

01:24:03.122 --> 01:24:06.907
They picked up hitchhikers,
young men, and brought 'em back here.

01:24:09.255 --> 01:24:12.839
Hey, Bri. This ain't gonna
give me nightmares, now, is it?

01:24:12.968 --> 01:24:15.009
Wait. Get out of the way.

01:24:17.808 --> 01:24:20.135
This one's called "Walk the Dog".

01:24:28.197 --> 01:24:30.404
My favorite one is "Rock the Cradle".

01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:43.121
They were asked just before they
were executed why they did it.

01:24:43.259 --> 01:24:45.299
And they said "To be famous."

01:24:46.847 --> 01:24:50.217
<i>- Why did you do it, Early?</i>

01:24:50.726 --> 01:24:53.183
Do what, Bri?

01:24:53.313 --> 01:24:56.434
You didn't have to kill
the gas station attendant.

01:24:56.568 --> 01:24:58.608
Move a little to the left.

01:25:02.033 --> 01:25:06.163
You wanted to. Why?

01:25:09.752 --> 01:25:13.668
Help me out, Early. You're right.
I don't know shit about killing.

01:25:13.924 --> 01:25:16.713
<i>- You gotta tell me.</i>

01:25:17.637 --> 01:25:19.964
- Does it make you feel good?
- Huh?

01:25:23.354 --> 01:25:25.097
- Powerful?
- Huh?

01:25:25.315 --> 01:25:27.853
- Superior?
- Huh?

01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:32.025
What? Who are you angry with?

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.448
Your mother? Your father?

01:25:38.499 --> 01:25:41.335
You wanna know
about my daddy? Do you?

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:47.254
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I'll tell ya about my daddy.

01:25:49.221 --> 01:25:52.472
Adele, you gotta help us out of here.
You gotta talk to Early because he's sick.

01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.063
- He needs some sort of help...
- Carrie, you're messin' up my trick.

01:25:57.190 --> 01:25:59.183
Adele, listen to me, please!

01:26:00.319 --> 01:26:04.484
Adele! The police are after him.
He killed a man back there!

01:26:04.616 --> 01:26:06.657
No, Carrie, that ain't true.

01:26:06.786 --> 01:26:08.827
I saw him kill a man!

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:11.625
No, Carrie, that ain't true.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:15.584
Adele, come on. I'm your friend.
Why would I lie about this?

01:26:16.215 --> 01:26:19.502
Why the hell would I lie about this?
I know you know!

01:26:19.803 --> 01:26:23.256
- Why are you saying these things?
- Why would I lie?!

01:26:25.269 --> 01:26:29.564
He said he didn't do it,
and you ain't my friend!

01:26:29.691 --> 01:26:34.106
You're on private property, ladies.
I'd like to see some identification.

01:26:34.239 --> 01:26:37.490
No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Carrie.
Please don't say anything.

01:26:37.619 --> 01:26:41.617
- We got a match. I'll call for backup.
- Please, please don't say anything.

01:26:42.124 --> 01:26:45.790
All right, ladies, I'd like both of you
to step slowly away from the car.

01:26:48.257 --> 01:26:50.050
<i>Noooooo!</i>

01:26:56.143 --> 01:26:57.970
Brian!

01:27:00.816 --> 01:27:02.893
<i>Early!</i>

01:27:03.027 --> 01:27:05.400
<i>Confirm your location, over.</i>

01:27:05.531 --> 01:27:07.654
<i>No, Early...</i>

01:27:13.124 --> 01:27:15.248
<i>-  Brian!
- Whoo!</i>

01:27:15.377 --> 01:27:17.417
Got 'em both on the dead run.

01:27:19.424 --> 01:27:24.337
Oh, no, no, no, Early!

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:27.095
- Early!
- Come on, momma.

01:27:30.397 --> 01:27:32.437
<i>Tell me that don't hurt.</i>

01:27:33.901 --> 01:27:35.942
- Here.
- What?

01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:40.862
Gotta put that crippled dog
out of his misery.

01:27:42.788 --> 01:27:46.324
You wanna know about it,
you gotta do it, son.

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:50.044
Shoot him. Come on, lay it on in there.

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:53.338
Come on, mean boy.

01:27:53.469 --> 01:27:56.221
<i>- Come on, mean boy! Do it!
- (Adele) Early!</i>

01:27:56.348 --> 01:27:59.718
Shoot him! Shoot the dog!
Shoot the dog! Shoot him.

01:28:00.896 --> 01:28:04.064
Time to live, boy. Shoot him!

01:28:05.401 --> 01:28:08.985
Come on! Go! Go, mean boy.

01:28:12.619 --> 01:28:16.666
- You faggot.
- Look at his face! It's not your father.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.784
- Look at him!
- I know that, you idiot!

01:28:19.086 --> 01:28:22.623
That's police in a world of hurtin'.
This here's a mercy killin'.

01:28:30.893 --> 01:28:33.350
Let's hit the road.

01:28:43.577 --> 01:28:46.947
You've not even said thank you.

01:28:47.958 --> 01:28:49.998
Thank you.

01:28:50.795 --> 01:28:52.835
Thank you for what, Adele?

01:28:54.967 --> 01:28:57.424
I don't know, Early.

01:28:57.554 --> 01:29:01.304
Well, Adele, it's for saving
your fuckin' life back there!

01:29:01.434 --> 01:29:04.934
Goddamn! You were this close
from spending the night in the county...

01:29:05.064 --> 01:29:08.516
- You murdering son of a bitch!
- Stop it, Carrie!

01:29:08.652 --> 01:29:10.811
- Are you fucking insane?
- Shut up!

01:29:10.947 --> 01:29:12.987
- He's a monster!
- Shut up, Carrie!

01:29:18.457 --> 01:29:21.244
<i>Goddamn! Bunch of loons.</i>

01:29:21.418 --> 01:29:23.246
<i># I've lost control!</i>

01:29:40.528 --> 01:29:43.446
<i>Look, momma.
There's a pretty house.</i>

01:29:45.033 --> 01:29:47.074
Maybe they got some beer.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:53.332
<i>Look at all the cactuses.</i>

01:29:55.715 --> 01:29:57.754
They're beautiful.

01:29:58.551 --> 01:30:01.043
You know what makes
cactuses so strong?

01:30:02.015 --> 01:30:06.310
You could just leave 'em and forget
about 'em forever and they'd still live.

01:30:06.479 --> 01:30:08.104
They keep growin' and...

01:30:08.231 --> 01:30:12.230
We gotta do somethin'
before Early kills somebody else.

01:30:12.361 --> 01:30:15.280
- And they breathe.
- Adele! Will you listen to me?

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:22.241
You can't do nothin', Brian. Just sit still.

01:30:42.735 --> 01:30:44.775
Adele.

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:49.447
You have beautiful cactuses, ma'am.

01:30:52.707 --> 01:30:54.747
I just love them.

01:30:55.919 --> 01:30:57.960
My momma had a garden.

01:30:58.423 --> 01:31:01.425
And, um... I had this little baby cactus.

01:31:01.677 --> 01:31:05.129
- I was gonna take it and plant it...
- You gotta talk to Adele.

01:31:05.265 --> 01:31:07.389
She looks up to you. She'll listen to you.

01:31:07.518 --> 01:31:10.935
I tried talking to her at the mine.
It didn't work.

01:31:11.064 --> 01:31:15.858
<i>- Try again.
- Hey, Bri. Did you ever stop... </i>

01:31:16.195 --> 01:31:20.943
...stop and think if you switched
two letters in your name...

01:31:21.244 --> 01:31:23.819
...it'd spell "brain"?

01:31:23.956 --> 01:31:26.080
<i>- Huh?</i>

01:31:30.632 --> 01:31:33.717
Boy, you got a problem.

01:31:36.598 --> 01:31:39.090
Goddammit.
What's wrong with Grandma?

01:31:52.369 --> 01:31:54.113
Where's your husband?

01:31:57.292 --> 01:31:58.917
I'm a widow.

01:31:59.044 --> 01:32:01.417
<i>- Yeah?</i>

01:32:25.955 --> 01:32:27.996
<i>That you, Peaches?</i>

01:32:29.084 --> 01:32:31.920
Sweetheart, hey. Come on over here.

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:34.336
It's so clear you can't believe it.

01:32:45.731 --> 01:32:47.772
It's just amazing.

01:32:47.901 --> 01:32:50.475
Come on over and look.
Take a look, honey.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:02.581
I want you to see this, Peaches.

01:33:02.712 --> 01:33:05.631
<i>- Peaches?</i>

01:33:11.432 --> 01:33:14.767
Early! Early.

01:33:16.564 --> 01:33:18.391
Um... Um...

01:33:19.025 --> 01:33:21.315
Um...

01:33:21.445 --> 01:33:23.438
Guess what, Early? Um...

01:33:23.573 --> 01:33:27.703
Miss Musgrave,
she has this guesthouse in the back...

01:33:27.954 --> 01:33:30.280
...and it's really beautiful.

01:33:30.416 --> 01:33:34.165
And it's empty, hon. She said
if me and you wanted to, honey...

01:33:34.296 --> 01:33:36.336
Hank!

01:33:36.466 --> 01:33:38.257
<i>Hank!</i>

01:33:42.347 --> 01:33:45.683
Well... you're a widow now, Peaches.

01:33:48.774 --> 01:33:50.398
<i>Boring.</i>

01:33:50.984 --> 01:33:52.563
Boring.

01:33:55.324 --> 01:33:57.566
Dogshit.

01:33:57.952 --> 01:34:01.405
That don't leave much
to the imagination, now, does it?

01:34:02.333 --> 01:34:04.373
Boring.

01:34:30.912 --> 01:34:33.583
I know him. That's my daddy.

01:34:35.627 --> 01:34:37.335
Fucker.

01:34:37.462 --> 01:34:39.337

01:34:57.781 --> 01:34:59.821
That's you, ain't it?

01:35:06.083 --> 01:35:09.585
Yeah, that's me. Do you like it?
What do you think?

01:35:25.527 --> 01:35:27.436
Dogshit.

01:35:28.656 --> 01:35:30.695
You can go now.

01:35:41.381 --> 01:35:43.504
Call me!

01:35:44.301 --> 01:35:46.675
You ought to control your woman, boy.

01:35:47.305 --> 01:35:50.391
Stinking. Stinking.

01:35:50.518 --> 01:35:53.639
Lucky for you
they take all kinds in California.

01:35:55.190 --> 01:35:57.231

Stop it!

01:36:35.577 --> 01:36:38.532
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna get the piano up.

01:36:38.665 --> 01:36:40.326
Try and slide your hands under.

01:36:40.584 --> 01:36:44.001

01:36:45.048 --> 01:36:47.457

I'm the one who got hit.

Cos I decided, Early...

01:36:57.523 --> 01:37:00.975
...I'm not gonna climb up

01:37:01.111 --> 01:37:03.733
- And why not?
- You're mean, Early.

01:37:04.658 --> 01:37:08.739
- No, I'm not.
- You hurt those people, Early.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.916
I don't wanna do it with you.

01:37:12.042 --> 01:37:14.120
I loved you, Early.

01:37:14.254 --> 01:37:16.710

01:37:50.843 --> 01:37:53.170
Shut up!

01:38:03.068 --> 01:38:06.486
Looks like I need me a new woman.

01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:10.489
- No! Not him!
- Shut up.

01:38:11.496 --> 01:38:13.537
Jesus! No!

01:38:13.666 --> 01:38:16.917
Oh, God, Early, I'll do anything.
I'll go with you. Please!

01:38:17.045 --> 01:38:20.166
Please don't kill him.
Oh, God, I'll do anything.

01:38:21.426 --> 01:38:23.301
Please don't kill him!

01:38:46.751 --> 01:38:51.629
Oh, momma, we gotta find us a door.
Save us some time.

01:38:51.758 --> 01:38:53.798
Goddamn, that's a super dress.

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.969
Yeah, that's just super.

01:39:02.188 --> 01:39:04.229
Shit.

01:40:18.248 --> 01:40:22.163
Oh. I didn't think he left anyone alive.

01:40:23.296 --> 01:40:26.298
- Where's Carrie?
- They took off down the road.

01:40:27.927 --> 01:40:29.968
Watch your head.

01:40:33.518 --> 01:40:35.595
Grab that chair.

01:40:36.564 --> 01:40:39.234
I'm gonna lift the piano. Slide it under.

01:40:54.254 --> 01:40:58.502
He pulled out all the phone lines.
The nearest one is 21 miles away.

01:41:00.512 --> 01:41:04.677
- He took the fire road west.
- Take your car and get to that phone.

01:41:04.809 --> 01:41:06.850
Call the police.

01:41:58.714 --> 01:42:01.170
Well, how y'all doin'?

01:42:01.301 --> 01:42:04.967
I'm Early. This is my woman, Carrie.

01:42:05.974 --> 01:42:11.218
Sorry to inconvenience y'all like this,
but looks like we'll be stayin' the night.

01:48:15.714 --> 01:48:19.464
Hey, Bri.
You wanna ask me some questions?

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:25.764
Bri!

01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:30.017
Ask me some questions. Come on.

01:48:31.443 --> 01:48:36.651
Do I feel powerful? Do I feel superior? No.

01:48:41.873 --> 01:48:43.666
No.

01:48:44.293 --> 01:48:46.501
I feel good.

01:48:49.424 --> 01:48:52.213
Bri, you're bleedin'.

01:48:54.473 --> 01:48:56.514
Bri. You're bleedin'!

01:48:58.938 --> 01:49:03.566

<i>When I looked into his eyes...</i>

01:51:05.188 --> 01:51:07.478
<i>...I felt nothing.</i>

01:51:07.608 --> 01:51:09.898
<i>Nothing.</i>

01:51:10.028 --> 01:51:14.109
<i>That day I learned that any one of us
is capable of taking another human life.</i>

01:51:15.661 --> 01:51:19.991
<i>But I also learned that there is
a difference between us and them.</i>

01:51:20.125 --> 01:51:22.414
<i>It's in feeling remorse.</i>

01:51:22.545 --> 01:51:24.584
<i>Dealing with guilt.</i>

01:51:25.299 --> 01:51:27.505

<i>But he's alive, see.</i>

01:52:35.808 --> 01:52:38.265
<i>Now, he's thinkin' about what he done...</i>

01:52:38.395 --> 01:52:42.774
<i>...goin' over it and over it and over it
in his head, every night...</i>

01:52:42.901 --> 01:52:46.188
<i>...thinkin' how smart he is

01:52:46.948 --> 01:52:48.989

Not bad. How was your swim?

01:52:58.547 --> 01:53:01.751
- It's freezing.

There's, um... this gallery in Venice...

...and I showed them my work,
the icon series.

01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:18.775
- I think they're interested.
- That's great.

01:53:18.907 --> 01:53:21.992
Well, it's not definite, but it's encouraging.

01:53:24.456 --> 01:53:26.948
Well, let's celebrate. I'll take you to lunch.

01:53:27.252 --> 01:53:29.411
OK.

01:53:30.005 --> 01:53:34.170
- So what happens next?
- Well, I have a meeting at the gallery...

01:53:34.302 --> 01:53:38.052
...and they want to see
some more of my work. So...

01:53:38.182 --> 01:53:41.552
