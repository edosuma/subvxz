00:49.997 --> 00:51.796
The queen is quaint,

00:51.797 --> 00:53.796
and quick conceit

00:53.797 --> 00:56.755
which makes her walk,
which way she list,

00:56.756 --> 01:00.035
and roots them up that lie in wait

01:00.036 --> 01:02.657
to work her treason, 'ere she wist.

01:03.116 --> 01:07.742
Her force is such against her foes,
that whom she meets...

01:08.877 --> 01:11.179
she overthrows.

02:24.035 --> 02:25.994
What ya doing, Hannah?

02:25.995 --> 02:27.535
Playing chess.

02:27.635 --> 02:29.175
Who's winning?

02:29.635 --> 02:30.994
White.

02:30.995 --> 02:32.660
How can you tell?

02:33.275 --> 02:35.634
When I move
White Queen here,

02:35.635 --> 02:38.753
Black Queen has to move
here to protect her King.

02:38.754 --> 02:40.993
Then, White Queen
takes Black Queen.

02:40.994 --> 02:43.979
Then Black Pawn takes her,
promotes to Queen,

02:44.234 --> 02:46.059
and that's checkmate.

02:49.635 --> 02:51.346
Playing that stupid game again?

02:52.035 --> 02:53.273
It's not stupid.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.353
See, that's your problem.

02:54.354 --> 02:55.433
You need to be out
looking for a boyfriend

02:55.434 --> 02:56.593
instead of playing
dumb games all day.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.180
It's not dumb!

02:58.394 --> 02:59.953
Stupid little girl playing
your stupid little games.

02:59.954 --> 03:01.433
Hey!

03:01.434 --> 03:02.633
Clean up the house, it's a mess.

03:02.634 --> 03:03.793
You are not the boss of me.

03:03.794 --> 03:04.953
I'm older than you.

03:04.954 --> 03:06.073
- So what?
- So that means

03:06.074 --> 03:08.945
you have to do what I say,
you little brat.

04:08.593 --> 04:10.432
You sure you want to do that?

04:10.433 --> 04:11.973
Why not?

04:12.153 --> 04:13.872
You're gonna leave yourself
with a weak defense.

04:13.873 --> 04:15.552
You know better than that.

04:15.553 --> 04:17.192
What's the difference?
I'm gonna beat you anyway.

04:17.192 --> 04:19.391
That's like bringing
a crab to a crawfish boil.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.951
That don't mean nothing.

04:20.952 --> 04:23.911
You gotta be able to wrassle
with a grand master.

04:23.912 --> 04:25.941
I thought you were
the state champion once.

04:26.672 --> 04:29.472
Yeah, well, once was
a long time ago.

04:29.473 --> 04:30.792
Oh, really, what happened?

04:30.793 --> 04:32.424
You know what happened.

04:32.513 --> 04:34.871
Don't get smart
with me, little girl.

04:34.872 --> 04:36.981
I just want to hear you say it.

04:39.872 --> 04:41.856
Goddamn hillbilly crack,
that's what.

04:42.592 --> 04:44.191
You best take my advice,

04:44.192 --> 04:47.336
if I ever see you around
that shit... pardon my French...

04:47.792 --> 04:50.231
I'll whip your butt good...
You understand?

04:50.232 --> 04:51.310
You couldn't catch me.

04:51.311 --> 04:52.430
Don't test me.

04:52.431 --> 04:57.071
Your Uncle Donny, he may look slow,
but I can still run down a kid.

04:57.072 --> 04:58.933
Especially with
chicken legs like yours.

04:58.952 --> 05:00.351
I don't have chicken legs.

05:00.352 --> 05:03.496
All right, how about
moving a piece?

05:10.551 --> 05:12.933
How come you don't ever
talk about daddy anymore?

05:16.151 --> 05:17.737
Hurts to talk.

05:19.392 --> 05:21.262
How do you forget?

05:24.232 --> 05:26.181
I told you, hillbilly crack.

05:27.791 --> 05:30.550
Point is, you don't forget,

05:30.551 --> 05:33.422
you just... move on.

05:35.351 --> 05:37.460
I don't want to move on.

06:05.230 --> 06:06.770
Hey.

06:06.830 --> 06:07.989
Oh, hey.

06:07.990 --> 06:09.230
What's up?

06:09.231 --> 06:11.270
- Nothing.
- Do I know you?

06:11.271 --> 06:12.590
I don't think so, no.

06:12.591 --> 06:14.430
You sure... I've seen you around.

06:14.431 --> 06:15.970
I doubt it.

06:16.350 --> 06:18.652
You're in the Chess Club, right?

06:19.310 --> 06:20.589
Yeah.

06:20.590 --> 06:22.176
Funny.

06:22.190 --> 06:23.509
What?

06:23.510 --> 06:25.549
You don't look like a chess geek.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.852
And what do they look like?

06:28.270 --> 06:29.810
I don't know.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.492
You don't know much, do you?

06:33.549 --> 06:35.261
Be-yotch.

07:28.669 --> 07:30.209
You're still high.

07:31.909 --> 07:33.148
No, I ain't.

07:33.149 --> 07:35.148
You haven't slept in two days.

07:35.149 --> 07:36.780
Okay, leave him alone.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.934
Take a shower, you're disgusting.

07:47.108 --> 07:48.739
Stop... you're such a loser!

07:49.708 --> 07:51.108
- God.
- No, he's not.

07:51.109 --> 07:53.148
He's a fucking drug addict, Hannah.

07:53.149 --> 07:54.468
Okay, stop it, Amber.

07:54.469 --> 07:55.908
Just leave him alone.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.448
Really? Come on.

07:57.628 --> 08:00.067
Hey! Amber!

08:43.028 --> 08:44.568
Hello, Hannah.

08:46.628 --> 08:48.626
I'm not supposed to
talk to strangers.

08:48.627 --> 08:51.248
Oh, that's okay,
I'm a federal agent.

08:52.467 --> 08:53.986
I'm not supposed to
talk to the law either.

08:53.987 --> 08:55.652
Is your uncle here?

08:55.987 --> 08:57.386
No.

08:57.387 --> 08:58.986
Know where I can find him?

08:58.987 --> 09:00.146
No tellin'.

09:00.147 --> 09:02.346
I need to speak to him.

09:02.347 --> 09:04.331
Why, is he in trouble?

09:05.026 --> 09:06.946
Well, your uncle has
gotten mixed up

09:06.947 --> 09:08.897
with some pretty bad people.

09:10.507 --> 09:12.506
Why don't you tell him to call me?

09:12.507 --> 09:14.491
Why would I do that?

09:14.507 --> 09:16.466
Well, if your uncle would be
willing to cooperate with us,

09:16.467 --> 09:18.866
maybe we could work out
some sort of deal.

09:18.867 --> 09:20.498
Let him off easy.

09:22.506 --> 09:24.808
We don't much like the law.

09:25.386 --> 09:26.972
That's too bad.

09:28.426 --> 09:30.728
Can I tell you a secret?

09:31.667 --> 09:35.586
Your uncle is gonna rot in
prison like the rest of them.

09:35.587 --> 09:37.386
And you, without a legal guardian,

09:37.387 --> 09:41.850
well, they're gonna ship you off
to a foster home somewhere.

09:45.386 --> 09:50.692
You tell him to call me,
before it's too late.

10:22.226 --> 10:23.766
Hello?

10:24.426 --> 10:26.625
They said they were
gonna ship us off.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.505
Hannah, he's just
trying to scare you.

10:28.506 --> 10:30.489
Maybe he's telling the truth.

10:30.985 --> 10:32.104
What, a cop?

10:32.105 --> 10:34.144
Maybe you should just call him.

10:34.145 --> 10:37.744
If I so much as look at a cop,
Frank's gonna have my head.

10:39.425 --> 10:41.727
Well, maybe he can protect you.

10:43.545 --> 10:45.846
Can't trust them, you know that.

10:46.064 --> 10:49.733
Frank's already got half
the law dogs on his payroll.

10:50.985 --> 10:52.969
What if we leave, then?

10:53.465 --> 10:54.944
Just run away.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.531
Hannah, honey.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.165
Sweetie.

11:01.505 --> 11:03.488
You know I can't leave.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.607
I can't.

11:14.065 --> 11:17.369
Then please don't let them
take my family away.

11:17.985 --> 11:19.854
At least what's left of it.

11:39.464 --> 11:41.095
I hate these things.

11:41.984 --> 11:44.332
Come on, it's your Uncle Frank.

11:44.344 --> 11:46.583
I don't care, I hate him.

11:46.584 --> 11:48.249
He's good to us.

11:49.064 --> 11:53.262
He acts like he owns us and
everyone else in this town.

11:53.263 --> 11:55.247
Just try to act right.

12:07.344 --> 12:10.010
In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.293
Amen.

12:19.343 --> 12:21.645
Heard you had a visitor today.

12:22.303 --> 12:23.843
Yes, sir.

12:24.623 --> 12:26.254
You know the rules.

12:27.062 --> 12:28.888
We don't talk to the law.

12:31.263 --> 12:32.803
I know.

12:34.543 --> 12:36.422
I promised your daddy if
anything happened to him,

12:36.423 --> 12:38.725
I'd look after you, and I have.

12:40.703 --> 12:42.846
Part of the family, right?

12:44.942 --> 12:46.482
Yes, sir.

12:47.222 --> 12:50.261
Don't bite the hand that
feeds you, you understand?

12:50.262 --> 12:51.927
I didn't say nothing.

12:53.182 --> 12:54.973
You know...

12:55.663 --> 12:58.422
you're looking more and more like
your mama every day,

12:58.423 --> 13:00.054
God rest her soul.

13:01.462 --> 13:02.923
Thanks.

13:07.542 --> 13:10.163
She was a real firecracker,
your mama.

13:13.102 --> 13:17.301
I remember, being the youngest
in the family and a girl,

13:17.302 --> 13:18.932
she had it tough.

13:19.982 --> 13:22.967
Bobby here would
torment her to no end.

13:24.662 --> 13:28.683
When she was 10, she had
these baby dolls.

13:30.262 --> 13:33.566
Loved those things like
they were her own children.

13:33.702 --> 13:36.003
One day Bobby stole them dolls,

13:36.421 --> 13:38.380
cut the heads off
and set 'em on fire,

13:38.381 --> 13:39.940
right in the front yard.

13:39.941 --> 13:43.380
Your mama, she just stood there,

13:43.381 --> 13:45.301
staring at the little
heads burning,

13:45.302 --> 13:48.685
tears running down her face,
but she never said a word.

13:50.782 --> 13:52.380
Instead, she walked in the house,

13:52.381 --> 13:56.003
picked up a bat and
whacked Bobby in the head.

13:56.341 --> 13:58.580
Put him in the hospital for a week!

13:58.581 --> 14:01.248
He ain't never been the same since.

14:06.661 --> 14:08.883
That's your mama.

14:30.340 --> 14:31.619
So, is that true?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.499
About mama hitting Uncle Bobby?

14:33.500 --> 14:34.960
Yeah, she could hit all right.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.460
That's why he's retarded.

14:36.461 --> 14:38.445
He ain't retarded, he's slow.

14:39.021 --> 14:41.100
Did you see the way he was
staring at me all night?

14:41.101 --> 14:42.179
- It was creeping me out.
- Yeah, you just think

14:42.180 --> 14:44.019
that every single guy
wants to get into your panties.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.099
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

14:45.100 --> 14:47.084
Both of y'all shut up.

14:47.740 --> 14:49.326
Women, goddamn.

14:50.220 --> 14:51.699
<i>For an instant bond
that stays strong,</i>

14:51.700 --> 14:53.739
<i>nothing beats Might-E Glue!</i>

14:53.740 --> 14:55.099
<i>No job is too big or too small</i>

14:55.100 --> 14:56.179
<i>for Might-E Glue!</i>

14:56.180 --> 14:57.259
<i>Might-E Glue is simply</i>

14:57.260 --> 14:59.058
<i>the strongest
adhesive on the planet.</i>

14:59.059 --> 15:02.059
<i>Its patented chemical
technology and advanced formula</i>

15:02.060 --> 15:05.603
<i>permanently bonds almost any
non-porous material together.</i>

15:05.980 --> 15:07.299
Might-E Glue!

15:07.300 --> 15:09.602
That's some amazing shit
right there.

15:10.380 --> 15:13.001
Yeah, that shit
will stick to anything.

15:13.460 --> 15:15.761
I should have invented that shit.

15:15.819 --> 15:17.405
Might-E Glue.

15:17.619 --> 15:19.250
Yeah.

15:35.899 --> 15:37.360
Hi, I'll be right there.

15:40.099 --> 15:41.778
Can I just get a coffee?

15:41.779 --> 15:44.207
Oh, yeah, coming right up.

15:52.979 --> 15:54.098
Thanks.

15:54.099 --> 15:55.639
You're welcome.

15:57.099 --> 15:58.639
You new?

15:58.779 --> 16:00.763
Oh, I just started nights.

16:01.099 --> 16:02.639
Where's Rose?

16:02.939 --> 16:04.978
She slipped in the shower
and busted her hip.

16:04.979 --> 16:08.248
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

16:09.938 --> 16:11.478
You live here?

16:11.698 --> 16:13.238
Uh-huh.

16:14.538 --> 16:15.697
I haven't seen you around much.

16:15.698 --> 16:17.098
You come here often?

16:17.099 --> 16:18.639
You're awful nosy.

16:19.939 --> 16:21.479
Just being friendly.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.977
I work for tips, you know.

16:23.978 --> 16:25.518
Right.

16:26.698 --> 16:27.857
Um, cream?

16:27.858 --> 16:29.398
Uh-huh.

16:29.578 --> 16:31.017
So, are you a regular?

16:31.018 --> 16:33.137
Yeah, I come in
a couple of nights a week.

16:33.138 --> 16:34.657
Thank you.

16:34.658 --> 16:35.817
Why?

16:35.818 --> 16:37.404
Food here sucks.

16:37.898 --> 16:39.484
Peace and quiet.

16:40.577 --> 16:42.977
Oh, you will get
plenty of that around here.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.537
You got a spoon?

16:46.538 --> 16:48.522
Oh, yeah, here you go.

16:49.978 --> 16:51.609
Sorry, they're still drying.

16:53.498 --> 16:55.209
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:59.577 --> 17:01.117
Well.

17:02.017 --> 17:03.557
I'm Bill.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.196
Amber.

17:06.497 --> 17:08.128
Nice to meet ya.

17:08.617 --> 17:10.157
Likewise.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.777
Can I get you something to eat?

17:12.778 --> 17:14.442
Oh, no, just coffee.

17:15.777 --> 17:17.840
I hear the food sucks.

17:19.777 --> 17:21.976
All right, well, if there's
anything I can do

17:21.977 --> 17:24.928
to enhance your dining
experience, let me know.

17:25.817 --> 17:27.448
You already have, Miss.

17:50.696 --> 17:52.575
What are you doing up?

17:52.576 --> 17:54.116
Just thinking.

17:54.536 --> 17:56.167
You think too much.

17:56.456 --> 17:57.855
What's with you?

17:57.856 --> 17:59.443
I met someone.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.077
Another one?

18:01.777 --> 18:03.363
This one's different.

18:04.776 --> 18:06.362
You're crazy.

18:06.656 --> 18:07.815
What do you know?

18:07.816 --> 18:09.959
You're the stupid little girl.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.255
Your uncle has gotten mixed up

18:18.256 --> 18:19.815
with some pretty bad people.

18:19.816 --> 18:21.214
Goddamn hillbilly crack.

18:21.215 --> 18:22.574
He's got all the local law dogs
on his payroll.

18:22.575 --> 18:23.735
Cut the heads off,

18:23.736 --> 18:24.975
set 'em on fire.

18:24.976 --> 18:26.535
He's a fucking drug addict, Hannah.

18:26.536 --> 18:28.815
Your uncle is gonna rot in prison.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.975
I can't leave.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.735
Don't bite the hand...

18:31.736 --> 18:33.615
They're gonna ship you off
to a foster home somewhere.

18:33.616 --> 18:35.884
Foster home,
foster home, foster home...

19:51.494 --> 19:53.125
Auditions are Thursday, honey.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.957
Oh, no, I'm looking
for my Uncle Frank.

20:23.813 --> 20:25.160
So...

20:26.093 --> 20:27.474
what can I do for you?

20:28.733 --> 20:32.834
Well, you said if I need
something I should come see you.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.405
What do you need?

20:35.854 --> 20:37.484
I need a job.

20:38.853 --> 20:40.518
I give Donny money.

20:40.733 --> 20:43.400
Yeah, I, I don't want any handouts.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.399
Okay?

20:46.093 --> 20:47.852
I want to earn it on my own.

20:47.853 --> 20:49.412
Sorry.

20:49.413 --> 20:51.124
I don't have anything.

20:55.693 --> 20:57.279
I was thinking...

20:58.133 --> 21:00.117
I could make some deliveries.

21:00.173 --> 21:01.713
Yeah?

21:02.133 --> 21:03.673
Yeah.

21:03.733 --> 21:06.212
Look, no ones gonna even look twice

21:06.213 --> 21:08.033
at some little girl
riding around town.

21:09.133 --> 21:10.371
Especially the cops.

21:12.492 --> 21:16.114
I swear, you got your mama's
gumption, that's for sure.

21:16.572 --> 21:19.193
How much is this gonna cost me?

21:19.772 --> 21:22.041
Twenty bucks per trip?

21:23.693 --> 21:25.324
Can I trust you?

21:26.852 --> 21:28.802
I'm family.

21:33.572 --> 21:37.399
Go see Donny in the morning,
he'll tell you what to do.

21:39.572 --> 21:41.522
And I'll pay you ten bucks a trip.

21:44.171 --> 21:45.711
Thanks, Uncle Frank.

21:46.412 --> 21:47.918
Don't let me down, Hannah.

21:54.532 --> 21:56.800
Shut the door.

22:01.091 --> 22:03.050
Where's my fucking dope?

22:03.051 --> 22:04.716
Where's my fucking dope?

22:10.531 --> 22:11.811
Fuck that!

22:14.452 --> 22:15.651
You understand me?

22:15.652 --> 22:17.450
You don't fuck with my family!

22:51.770 --> 22:54.169
The pawns, poor pawns

22:54.170 --> 22:56.009
are silly swains

22:56.010 --> 22:58.995
which seldom serve except by hap.

23:00.330 --> 23:03.650
And yet those pawns
can lay their trains

23:03.651 --> 23:05.794
to catch a great man in a trap.

23:07.731 --> 23:10.809
So that I see, sometimes a groom

23:10.810 --> 23:13.272
may not be spared from his room.

23:38.690 --> 23:41.848
Your daddy would never
let you work for the Stinsons.

23:41.849 --> 23:43.480
Well, Daddy's not here.

23:43.689 --> 23:45.354
Hannah.

23:49.089 --> 23:50.688
So what's it worth, anyway?

23:50.689 --> 23:52.649
More than you and me put together.

23:52.650 --> 23:54.089
How much?

23:54.090 --> 23:55.721
I don't know, 20,000?

23:56.050 --> 23:58.193
Holy shit.

23:59.009 --> 24:00.549
Enough questions.

24:01.009 --> 24:03.008
Just deliver the package
and get out of there.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.674
Don't talk to anybody.

24:05.049 --> 24:06.635
Promise?

24:07.009 --> 24:08.720
Promise.

24:51.048 --> 24:53.032
I'm looking for Mr. Owens.

24:54.088 --> 24:55.719
What do you want?

24:56.448 --> 24:58.407
I got business with him.

24:58.408 --> 25:00.039
Selling Girl Scout cookies?

25:01.368 --> 25:03.989
Are you gonna fetch him or not?

25:04.648 --> 25:06.366
Tell you what, you little shit.

25:06.367 --> 25:07.846
How about you
get the hell on outta here

25:07.847 --> 25:09.447
before I put you over my knee?

25:09.448 --> 25:11.034
How about that?

25:11.128 --> 25:14.238
Then how about I tell my Uncle
Frank you just said that to me.

25:18.328 --> 25:19.959
Thanks.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.713
Bill?

25:32.087 --> 25:33.673
Who's asking?

25:34.608 --> 25:36.148
Frank sent me.

25:37.568 --> 25:39.527
Frank's recruiting
kinda young, ain't he?

25:39.528 --> 25:41.446
Look, do you want it or not?

25:41.447 --> 25:42.987
You're a pistol.

25:43.527 --> 25:45.192
You got a problem?

25:46.047 --> 25:47.486
No, Miss.

25:47.487 --> 25:49.073
Good.

25:50.367 --> 25:52.707
Now, just give me my money
so I can get out of here.

26:08.327 --> 26:09.526
Hey.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.846
What you say your name was?

26:10.847 --> 26:12.592
I didn't.

26:27.367 --> 26:29.046
Ain't you the cutest little thing?

26:29.047 --> 26:30.405
Fucker!

26:30.406 --> 26:31.525
Look, I don't care.

26:31.526 --> 26:33.669
I want it now.

26:35.566 --> 26:37.231
Hang on a second.

26:37.326 --> 26:38.912
- What?
- The money.

26:39.046 --> 26:40.632
Please?

26:45.966 --> 26:47.404
Here.

26:47.405 --> 26:48.945
Thanks.

26:49.405 --> 26:52.245
Look, I'm asking you
nice one the last time.

26:52.246 --> 26:54.196
Don't make me ask again.

26:56.486 --> 27:00.108
I sure wouldn't want
to be on your shit list.

27:00.526 --> 27:03.557
Eventually everyone ends up
on my shit list.

27:22.245 --> 27:23.831
What's the matter?

27:24.605 --> 27:26.004
Huh?

27:26.005 --> 27:27.795
Nothing.

27:31.445 --> 27:33.907
I know that face.

27:35.445 --> 27:37.509
What face?

27:38.964 --> 27:40.835
A man who wants out.

27:42.445 --> 27:44.235
No.

27:46.285 --> 27:47.916
You can tell me.

27:48.965 --> 27:50.505
No, it's...

27:52.405 --> 27:53.945
It's nothing.

27:56.204 --> 27:57.869
What is it?

28:00.844 --> 28:02.384
It's complicated.

28:03.564 --> 28:05.104
My life, it's...

28:06.605 --> 28:08.145
It's complicated.

28:10.245 --> 28:12.785
I can do complicated.

28:17.244 --> 28:19.194
You know what I do?

28:19.524 --> 28:21.872
I don't care.

28:23.484 --> 28:25.627
It don't bother you?

28:27.484 --> 28:30.184
No, I just want you.

28:47.203 --> 28:50.082
The King himself is haughty care

28:50.083 --> 28:52.067
which overlooks all his men.

28:53.083 --> 28:55.362
And when he sees how they fare,

28:55.363 --> 28:57.985
he steps among them now and then.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.123
For when his foe presumes to check,

29:01.124 --> 29:04.586
his servants stand
to give the neck.

29:28.403 --> 29:29.989
Hello?

31:19.880 --> 31:21.359
Hannah?

31:21.360 --> 31:22.900
Hannah!

31:23.120 --> 31:25.741
I know you're in there,
I can see your bicycle.

31:28.441 --> 31:30.027
Hey!

31:30.281 --> 31:31.600
Hannah!

31:31.601 --> 31:33.665
Coming!

31:39.160 --> 31:40.666
Hannah!

31:48.520 --> 31:50.584
Hello.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.422
Ain't you supposed to be working?

31:56.080 --> 31:57.519
Yes, sir.

31:57.520 --> 32:01.506
We're not paying you to just
sit around here at the house.

32:02.600 --> 32:04.550
Yes, sir.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.579
Where's Amber?

32:09.359 --> 32:10.785
She's working.

32:13.639 --> 32:15.941
Well, tell her I stopped by.

32:16.199 --> 32:17.830
Yes, sir.

32:36.159 --> 32:37.699
Hey.

32:38.239 --> 32:39.700
How do I look?

32:42.078 --> 32:43.237
How do you look?

32:43.238 --> 32:44.779
Yeah.

32:45.559 --> 32:47.224
You look fucking beautiful.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.303
Oh.

32:55.999 --> 32:57.238
Hey.

32:57.239 --> 32:58.824
Oh, hey.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.540
Hey, Amber, this here is Jackson.

33:01.998 --> 33:03.517
He's my right hand man.

33:03.518 --> 33:05.037
Hi.

33:05.038 --> 33:06.703
Nice to meet you.

33:07.078 --> 33:09.746
So, this is the lady
I've been hearing about.

33:11.159 --> 33:12.460
I... I guess.

33:13.999 --> 33:15.318
What's up?

33:15.319 --> 33:16.949
I got some business.

33:17.198 --> 33:18.784
I was just about to leave.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.263
- See you later?
- Yeah.

33:22.598 --> 33:23.899
Nice to meet you.

33:30.318 --> 33:32.476
Are you crazy... She's a Stinson.

33:32.477 --> 33:33.596
So what?

33:33.597 --> 33:35.900
So, Frank will have your head.

33:36.918 --> 33:38.902
I've got it under control.

33:39.598 --> 33:41.877
Do you even know who she is?

33:41.878 --> 33:43.878
Shit, that bitch has seen
more helmets than Hitler.

33:46.878 --> 33:49.066
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

33:53.637 --> 33:55.076
Hey, hey.

33:55.077 --> 33:56.708
Don't touch anything, please.

33:57.397 --> 34:00.177
Why?

34:00.318 --> 34:01.477
I'll tell you why.

34:01.478 --> 34:02.757
Red phosphorous, right there.

34:02.758 --> 34:04.344
Caustic soda.

34:05.398 --> 34:06.937
Benzene.

34:07.317 --> 34:08.835
Phosphine gas.

34:08.837 --> 34:10.396
Highly flammable shit.

34:10.397 --> 34:11.835
I mean, you mix them up,

34:11.837 --> 34:13.676
you've got a real shit storm
on your hands.

34:13.677 --> 34:14.835
Shit storm?

34:14.837 --> 34:16.786
Yeah, one spark and boom.

34:18.197 --> 34:19.315
Like boom?

34:19.317 --> 34:21.779
Like boom!

34:23.556 --> 34:25.505
How do you know that?

34:26.476 --> 34:28.016
I just do.

34:29.397 --> 34:30.956
Where did you learn
about all this stuff?

34:30.956 --> 34:33.828
Well, in my youth...

34:35.797 --> 34:38.356
I was really into
science, you know?

34:38.357 --> 34:39.835
And school.

34:39.835 --> 34:41.978
Till I dropped out.

34:44.315 --> 34:46.186
Guess it wasn't
a total waste, though.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.897
Don't touch anything.

34:53.237 --> 34:54.868
Okay.

35:05.796 --> 35:07.336
What's up?

35:07.396 --> 35:08.936
Not much.

35:09.436 --> 35:10.875
Hand me that wrench, will you?

35:10.876 --> 35:12.395
Torque or socket?

35:12.396 --> 35:13.674
Socket.

35:13.675 --> 35:15.215
Okay.

35:15.875 --> 35:17.462
Here you go.

35:17.796 --> 35:19.382
Thanks.

35:19.396 --> 35:21.346
Looks like a half-inch to me?

35:24.516 --> 35:25.715
Here.

35:25.716 --> 35:27.666
Thanks.

35:31.515 --> 35:33.554
How come a young girl like you

35:33.555 --> 35:35.594
knows so much about wrenches, huh?

35:35.595 --> 35:39.914
Oh, uh, my dad used to
like to fix cars,

35:39.915 --> 35:42.395
and I always liked to watch him.

35:42.396 --> 35:43.635
Oh, mechanic huh?

35:43.636 --> 35:45.176
No.

35:45.236 --> 35:48.903
No, he broke more things
than he fixed, I think.

35:52.435 --> 35:54.714
Your daddy know what you're doing?

35:54.715 --> 35:56.255
No.

35:56.635 --> 35:58.175
No, he's dead.

36:00.315 --> 36:02.617
Yeah, he died a year ago.

36:04.274 --> 36:06.576
Live with your mama then, huh?

36:07.475 --> 36:09.903
Nope, she's dead too.

36:11.635 --> 36:13.394
- Oh.
- Yeah...

36:13.395 --> 36:14.935
I'm sorry.

36:15.595 --> 36:17.056
Okay.

36:20.675 --> 36:22.214
Um...

36:24.314 --> 36:25.553
This.

36:25.554 --> 36:27.060
Right.

36:29.714 --> 36:31.254
Here you go.

36:31.274 --> 36:32.781
Thank you.

36:34.995 --> 36:36.820
Okay.

36:37.555 --> 36:38.713
See you later.

36:38.714 --> 36:40.618
Later.

36:55.473 --> 36:56.592
It's your move.

36:56.593 --> 36:57.833
I'm thinking.

36:57.834 --> 37:00.673
Okay, well, are you
going to think all clay?

37:00.674 --> 37:02.305
It's just a game.

37:02.634 --> 37:04.174
No, it's not.

37:04.754 --> 37:07.705
Geez, Hannah, when
did you get so serious?

37:08.634 --> 37:10.174
I don't know.

37:10.834 --> 37:12.992
You never use to be like this.

37:12.993 --> 37:15.660
You used to smile all the time.

37:15.873 --> 37:18.072
I remember when
you were a little baby,

37:18.073 --> 37:22.423
I used to bounce you on my knee,
grinning like an idiot.

37:22.673 --> 37:24.833
Shoot, I could
drop you on the floor,

37:24.834 --> 37:29.352
you'd bounce right back up with
a big old smile on your face.

37:29.353 --> 37:31.337
Couldn't stop you from smiling.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.984
Can't remember
the last time I seen you smile.

37:39.633 --> 37:43.540
Guess I just don't have
a lot to smile about lately.

37:48.232 --> 37:49.632
What about a boyfriend?

37:49.633 --> 37:51.173
Got a boyfriend?

37:51.713 --> 37:53.253
Hmm?

37:53.273 --> 37:54.792
You sound like Amber Dawn.

37:54.793 --> 37:56.333
Just saying.

37:56.713 --> 38:00.699
Girls your age, usually that's
all they think about, is boys.

38:01.993 --> 38:04.260
I'm not most girls.

38:09.032 --> 38:10.663
No, you're not.

38:12.552 --> 38:14.264
You surely are not.

38:17.793 --> 38:20.351
The bishop, he is witty brain,

38:20.352 --> 38:23.337
that chooses crosses paths to pace.

38:24.312 --> 38:26.871
And ever more he pries with pain

38:26.872 --> 38:29.493
to see who seeks him most disgrace.

38:30.952 --> 38:34.391
Such stragglers when
he finds astray,

38:34.392 --> 38:37.615
he takes them up and throws away.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.911
How many?

38:41.912 --> 38:44.135
10, 12.

38:46.672 --> 38:48.212
Shit.

38:48.592 --> 38:49.831
That ain't all.

38:49.832 --> 38:51.497
You know Jersey Mike?

38:52.312 --> 38:53.830
Beat to death.

38:53.831 --> 38:56.270
You don't sell bad shit
to a speed freak.

38:56.271 --> 38:57.590
What was in it?

38:57.591 --> 38:59.177
Vitamins.

38:59.271 --> 39:00.811
Vitamins?

39:00.951 --> 39:03.710
And you're sure it's
none of our people?

39:03.711 --> 39:05.582
I'm positive.

39:15.871 --> 39:17.502
A dozen, you say?

39:18.631 --> 39:20.171
At least.

39:24.711 --> 39:26.694
So, what do you want?

39:26.750 --> 39:28.575
Compensation.

39:29.871 --> 39:31.457
Bill...

39:32.311 --> 39:33.870
If I start handing out compensation

39:33.871 --> 39:36.790
to every one of my customers
who has a problem,

39:36.791 --> 39:38.775
when is it gonna end?

39:39.311 --> 39:41.790
Before you know it,
I'll be giving product away.

39:41.791 --> 39:43.629
I've got a business to run here.

39:43.630 --> 39:45.029
Are you gonna sit here and take
this happy horse shit...

39:45.030 --> 39:47.014
Shut the fuck up, Jackson.

39:47.030 --> 39:49.330
You really should keep
a muzzle on your pooch here.

39:50.190 --> 39:51.709
This is fucking stupid.

39:51.710 --> 39:53.250
- What?
- Huh?

39:53.350 --> 39:54.549
What'd you say?

39:54.550 --> 39:55.870
What, are you retarded?

39:55.871 --> 39:57.430
You ripped us off and we're
supposed to sit here

39:57.431 --> 39:58.510
and take it up the ass?

39:58.511 --> 39:59.790
Hell, no.

39:59.791 --> 40:01.389
- Bobby!
- Hey!

40:01.390 --> 40:03.549
- Sit down...
- I'm warning you.

40:03.550 --> 40:06.501
I said sit down.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.935
I am.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.780
Price just went up.

40:20.550 --> 40:24.900
You come in here and insult me,
accuse me of cheating.

40:26.470 --> 40:28.135
Price just went up.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.290
Frank.

40:31.110 --> 40:35.971
Look, you don't like it,
go shop somewhere else.

40:38.709 --> 40:41.330
I'm tired of kissing his ass.

40:41.549 --> 40:43.851
We outnumber them ten to one.

40:45.590 --> 40:49.509
You give me the word and I'll
kill him and his psycho brother.

40:49.510 --> 40:51.174
No.

40:53.069 --> 40:55.019
What do you mean "no"?

40:55.909 --> 40:57.108
I mean no.

40:57.109 --> 40:58.774
You going soft?

41:03.029 --> 41:04.660
Is it the girl?

41:05.069 --> 41:06.700
It ain't the girl.

41:08.388 --> 41:09.849
We need time.

41:12.589 --> 41:14.220
Time for what?

41:15.749 --> 41:17.414
Jackson.

41:21.589 --> 41:23.414
Fine.

41:36.589 --> 41:38.891
You think it was them?

41:39.429 --> 41:41.254
Hell, yeah, it was them.

41:47.948 --> 41:49.488
You okay?

41:49.948 --> 41:51.547
Oh...

41:51.548 --> 41:54.215
my head's pounding
like a fucking drum.

41:54.628 --> 41:56.627
You know, back in the middle ages,

41:56.628 --> 41:58.895
if you disrespected the King...

41:59.707 --> 42:00.786
you got killed.

42:00.787 --> 42:03.409
Yeah, well, this ain't
the middle ages.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.412
We got to get these
hillbillies in line.

42:09.148 --> 42:10.827
We got to show 'em
who's boss, you know?

42:10.828 --> 42:14.132
I mean, they're, they're
beginning to forget, you know?

42:15.787 --> 42:18.089
We got to teach them some respect.

42:27.428 --> 42:31.858
So... you don't know
anything about this?

42:34.347 --> 42:35.933
Hell no, Frank.

42:36.587 --> 42:37.746
You know...

42:37.747 --> 42:41.706
Using a little bit here and
there, you know, just a taste.

42:41.707 --> 42:44.089
I got no reason to steal
my own shit.

42:49.546 --> 42:50.745
You stop anywhere?

42:50.746 --> 42:52.287
See anyone?

42:53.347 --> 42:54.887
No, sir.

42:55.507 --> 42:57.491
You lying to me, girl?

42:58.267 --> 43:00.490
I can smell a liar a mile away.

43:01.827 --> 43:03.346
No, sir.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.490
She don't know nothing
about this, Frank.

43:12.226 --> 43:15.814
Okay, you can go.

43:26.666 --> 43:28.185
What the hell was that, huh?

43:28.186 --> 43:29.772
I don't know.

43:29.826 --> 43:33.705
I know you, Hannah Lee Baker,
and you're up to something.

43:33.706 --> 43:36.657
Don't go messing around
with your Uncle Frank, all right?

43:38.706 --> 43:40.304
Promise me you're not
up to something?

43:40.305 --> 43:41.824
Okay.

43:41.825 --> 43:44.015
For real?

43:46.826 --> 43:48.696
Cross my heart and hope to die.

43:52.226 --> 43:54.210
You're just like your daddy.

43:54.586 --> 43:56.225
Smart as a whip.

43:56.226 --> 43:58.129
Stubborn as a mule.

44:11.866 --> 44:13.584
The Knight is knowledge,

44:13.585 --> 44:16.206
how to fight,
against his prince's enemies.

44:17.265 --> 44:20.744
He never makes his walk
outright, but leaps and skips,

44:20.745 --> 44:24.584
and wily wise to take
by sleight a traitorous foe,

44:24.585 --> 44:27.775
might slyly seek their overthrow.

44:49.104 --> 44:51.327
Who's stupid now, huh?

44:52.224 --> 44:54.765
Who's stupid now?

45:13.704 --> 45:15.103
Hey.

45:15.104 --> 45:16.769
Hey.

45:21.703 --> 45:23.243
Here.

45:31.784 --> 45:33.449
What's the matter?

45:36.664 --> 45:39.489
Two of my boys
got killed last night.

45:46.543 --> 45:47.969
I'm really sorry.

45:53.504 --> 45:55.102
Know anything about it?

45:55.103 --> 45:56.643
Hmm?

45:57.623 --> 45:59.049
No.

46:01.103 --> 46:02.643
Frank say nothing?

46:03.743 --> 46:07.604
I-I just... deliver packages.

46:13.862 --> 46:16.484
Why... you think
Uncle Frank did it?

46:17.703 --> 46:20.893
No, no, uh...

46:23.503 --> 46:24.702
His brother.

46:24.703 --> 46:25.862
Bobby?

46:25.863 --> 46:27.847
Mm-hmm.

46:35.702 --> 46:37.891
So, what are you gonna do?

46:39.622 --> 46:41.209
Nothing.

46:42.183 --> 46:43.723
Why not?

46:45.582 --> 46:47.532
'Cause I need this.

46:54.462 --> 46:56.651
I could help you.

46:58.342 --> 46:59.621
The Rooks are reason

46:59.622 --> 47:01.162
on both sides,

47:01.382 --> 47:03.683
which keep the corner houses still.

47:04.381 --> 47:06.941
And warily stand
to watch their tides,

47:06.942 --> 47:09.609
by secret art to work their will.

47:10.102 --> 47:12.741
To take some time a thief unseen,

47:12.742 --> 47:16.603
might mischief mean
to King or Queen.

47:24.341 --> 47:26.325
What are you doing here?

47:26.541 --> 47:28.500
I thought you were
gonna quit that stuff.

47:28.501 --> 47:29.740
I will.

47:29.741 --> 47:31.726
When?

47:33.542 --> 47:34.781
When I feel like it, I guess.

47:34.782 --> 47:37.402
When are you gonna feel like it?

47:37.781 --> 47:39.412
I don't know, Hannah.

47:40.341 --> 47:41.540
Did you come over here
to lecture me?

47:41.541 --> 47:43.100
I mean, you're not
my mama, you know.

47:43.101 --> 47:44.340
I know!

47:44.341 --> 47:46.420
But that stuff is gonna
kill you if you don't quit.

47:46.421 --> 47:47.780
I got it under control.

47:47.781 --> 47:51.740
I mean, I... I just need a little
taste for the day, you know?

47:51.741 --> 47:53.459
You're never gonna quit this stuff.

47:53.460 --> 47:55.419
You gotta make a change.

47:55.420 --> 47:56.961
A change?

47:58.221 --> 48:01.940
Look around you, Hannah,
there's no change.

48:01.941 --> 48:04.847
There can be, but we
have to start right now.

48:05.821 --> 48:07.361
Now... How?

48:07.501 --> 48:09.087
Bill Owens.

48:09.341 --> 48:11.768
Bill... Bill Owens?

48:12.500 --> 48:13.579
Yeah.

48:13.580 --> 48:14.659
Bill Owens?

48:14.660 --> 48:16.499
That's your plan... Bill Owens?

48:16.500 --> 48:19.804
You leave Frank
and you go work for Bill.

48:21.220 --> 48:22.807
Hannah, sweetie.

48:23.301 --> 48:25.888
The only way I'm leaving
Frank is in a body bag.

48:29.300 --> 48:31.602
So you're just scared of him?

48:32.740 --> 48:35.042
Fucking right I'm scared of him.

48:35.660 --> 48:37.379
You, little girl, have no idea

48:37.380 --> 48:38.739
of what the Stinsons
are capable of!

48:38.740 --> 48:40.659
You have no idea
of what I'm capable of.

48:40.660 --> 48:41.859
Hannah.

48:41.860 --> 48:43.888
Don't.

48:47.700 --> 48:49.650
What do you mean?

48:53.340 --> 48:55.339
That stuff is gonna kill you.

48:55.340 --> 48:56.846
Hannah.

49:28.339 --> 49:31.458
So, when am I gonna meet
your Uncle Donny?

49:31.459 --> 49:33.045
Never.

49:33.499 --> 49:35.084
Why?

49:35.458 --> 49:37.044
I don't know.

49:38.379 --> 49:39.965
Get his blessing.

49:40.699 --> 49:42.239
Don't need it.

49:42.739 --> 49:44.723
He's an embarrassment.

49:47.299 --> 49:49.966
I think I'm an
embarrassment to you.

49:52.298 --> 49:53.929
Well, the age thing.

49:54.418 --> 49:56.846
Stop it.

49:58.418 --> 49:59.924
It's silly.

50:35.818 --> 50:37.404
Hey.

50:37.578 --> 50:39.721
Hi.

50:40.458 --> 50:41.696
What are you watching?

50:41.697 --> 50:43.886
Uh, creepy crawlies.

50:51.537 --> 50:53.123
Creepy crawlies.

50:54.418 --> 50:56.118
That's what daddy
used to call them.

51:02.257 --> 51:03.922
I miss him.

51:05.657 --> 51:07.641
Me too.

51:16.496 --> 51:18.560
I need to tell you something.

51:21.657 --> 51:23.243
I'm moving out.

51:23.497 --> 51:24.656
What?

51:24.657 --> 51:26.641
I'm moving in with someone.

51:28.537 --> 51:30.123
Who?

51:30.617 --> 51:32.255
His name is Bill.

51:32.256 --> 51:33.637
Bill Owens.

51:35.296 --> 51:36.836
Bill Owens?

51:37.456 --> 51:39.121
Yeah, you know him?

51:39.296 --> 51:42.575
Wait... is that the person
that you've been seeing?

51:42.576 --> 51:44.879
Yeah, how do you know Bill?

51:45.177 --> 51:46.808
Just from around.

51:48.377 --> 51:50.166
I like Bill.

51:51.376 --> 51:52.916
Me too.

51:53.536 --> 51:55.838
There's finally
something we agree on.

51:57.536 --> 51:59.838
Yeah, I guess.

52:00.136 --> 52:02.916
You know, Uncle Frank
ain't gonna like that.

52:04.376 --> 52:06.837
I don't really care what he likes.

52:16.336 --> 52:18.215
Think he's up to something?

52:18.216 --> 52:20.757
Of course he's up to something.

52:22.216 --> 52:23.801
Christ.

52:24.575 --> 52:27.414
Can't Donny keep
a couple of girls in line?

52:27.415 --> 52:30.525
Can't trust that useless
drug addict for nothing.

52:34.255 --> 52:36.558
Okay, I'll talk to her.

52:38.176 --> 52:39.574
I'm sick of dealing
with these assholes.

52:39.575 --> 52:41.877
They think they're better than us.

52:42.175 --> 52:43.414
We should just cut 'em out.

52:43.415 --> 52:45.454
We don't have
the distribution chain.

52:45.455 --> 52:47.086
I'll handle the business.

52:48.255 --> 52:49.795
You fetch me Amber.

52:58.494 --> 53:00.604
It's really loud!

53:07.495 --> 53:09.160
Louder, the better.

53:12.335 --> 53:13.413
She fast?

53:56.734 --> 53:58.274
That was awesome.

53:58.814 --> 54:01.003
We'll make a biker out of you yet.

54:03.214 --> 54:04.753
Amber told me.

54:05.813 --> 54:07.332
About you and her.

54:07.333 --> 54:08.964
You cool with that?

54:10.013 --> 54:11.553
I guess.

54:11.933 --> 54:14.012
'Cause I sure as hell
am too old for you.

54:15.493 --> 54:18.240
Yeah.

54:19.174 --> 54:21.237
Does she know about our deal?

54:22.293 --> 54:23.833
No.

54:24.093 --> 54:26.513
No, the less she knows about
our business, the better.

54:32.533 --> 54:34.244
So...

54:35.933 --> 54:37.473
You gonna take care of us?

54:42.213 --> 54:43.844
Yes, ma'am.

54:47.053 --> 54:48.354
Okay.

54:49.853 --> 54:51.439
Check.

54:52.453 --> 54:54.198
Hmm.

55:01.812 --> 55:03.352
Mm-mm.

55:08.213 --> 55:10.277
That's my piece,
what are you doing?

55:13.492 --> 55:15.032
Mm-mm.

55:15.212 --> 55:16.798
What, then?

55:16.852 --> 55:18.483
Well, you can't win.

55:18.492 --> 55:20.794
You can force a draw, though.

55:20.972 --> 55:22.931
What if I don't want a draw?

55:22.932 --> 55:24.251
Well, it's lose or draw.

55:24.252 --> 55:25.792
Your choice.

55:27.252 --> 55:29.490
It's a sad state when you get
your ass handed to you

55:29.491 --> 55:31.031
by a teenager.

55:31.171 --> 55:32.491
Yeah, you want to play again?

55:32.492 --> 55:33.811
Yeah.

55:33.812 --> 55:35.796
Rack 'em up, Bobby Fischer.

55:36.492 --> 55:38.317
Shit.

55:40.252 --> 55:42.236
So, what we talked about.

55:43.572 --> 55:45.236
Did you think about it?

55:48.771 --> 55:50.170
Yeah, I thought about it.

55:50.171 --> 55:51.711
And?

55:52.051 --> 55:54.850
And as long as Frank's alive
and I'm still cooking,

55:54.851 --> 55:58.076
he ain't ever gonna
let me leave, Hannah.

56:06.771 --> 56:09.073
Can I tell you something?

56:09.451 --> 56:12.231
Yeah.

56:15.851 --> 56:17.835
You know the missing drugs?

56:17.971 --> 56:20.398
Yeah, Frank's missing drugs,
I heard about 'em.

56:25.171 --> 56:27.370
So... that was me,

56:27.371 --> 56:28.730
- but...
- What?

56:28.731 --> 56:30.050
- If you could just listen for a second...
- That was you?

56:30.051 --> 56:31.130
But I just...

56:31.131 --> 56:32.370
- If you could just listen to me.
- Are you selling Frank's drugs?

56:32.371 --> 56:33.650
- Could you listen to me?
- Are you crazy?

56:33.651 --> 56:34.730
- Okay, well you're clearly
- What the hell

56:34.731 --> 56:36.129
- not gonna listen to me.
- are you doing, Hannah?

56:36.130 --> 56:38.671
- So I'm just gonna go.
- Wait, wait... woah, woah, wait.

56:39.930 --> 56:41.755
I'm sorry.

56:43.570 --> 56:45.235
Are you going to listen?

56:47.971 --> 56:49.636
Yeah.

56:54.370 --> 56:55.796
I have a plan.

56:58.010 --> 56:59.596
All right.

57:00.930 --> 57:02.356
What?

57:05.090 --> 57:08.394
We move in with Bill
until this blows over.

57:09.050 --> 57:11.033
He'll take care of us.

57:11.329 --> 57:13.314
All of us.

57:16.330 --> 57:18.314
We can be a family again.

57:23.490 --> 57:25.201
A real family.

57:30.769 --> 57:32.150
I'll try.

57:33.929 --> 57:35.594
I'll try.

58:13.009 --> 58:14.488
I'm starving.

58:14.489 --> 58:16.088
What do you got?

58:16.089 --> 58:17.628
Kitchen's closed.

58:19.928 --> 58:21.327
How about a piece of pie?

58:21.328 --> 58:22.407
Are you deaf?

58:22.408 --> 58:24.039
I said it's closed.

58:25.248 --> 58:28.287
You don't seem like you're
too happy to see me.

58:28.288 --> 58:30.248
That's because
every time I see you,

58:30.249 --> 58:31.710
Uncle Frank wants something.

58:33.968 --> 58:35.927
Well, he wants to see you.

58:35.928 --> 58:37.247
Now.

58:37.248 --> 58:38.407
I worked a really long day.

58:38.408 --> 58:39.994
I'm tired.

58:41.048 --> 58:42.588
Take your time.

58:43.968 --> 58:45.047
Not going.

58:45.048 --> 58:46.634
I wasn't asking.

58:46.888 --> 58:48.167
I don't take orders from you.

58:48.168 --> 58:49.447
Hey, listen.

58:49.448 --> 58:51.526
Don't get smart with me, all right?

58:51.527 --> 58:52.926
Stop!

58:52.927 --> 58:54.513
- Listen.
- Stop!

58:55.488 --> 58:57.247
What do you see in
that hillbilly, anyway, huh,

58:57.248 --> 58:58.407
when you could be with me?

58:58.408 --> 58:59.767
Are you crazy?

58:59.768 --> 59:01.327
Stop!

59:01.328 --> 59:03.247
Stop it, you're hurting me!

59:03.248 --> 59:05.516
Let go of me!

59:07.288 --> 59:08.827
Stop!

01:00:08.366 --> 01:00:10.270
Hello.

01:00:12.527 --> 01:00:14.158
What?

01:00:42.526 --> 01:00:46.194
Doctor, I'm-I'm-
I'm Donny, her uncle.

01:00:46.886 --> 01:00:47.965
Who did this?

01:00:47.966 --> 01:00:49.924
Did she say how this happened?

01:00:49.925 --> 01:00:52.324
No, she was unconscious
when she came in.

01:00:52.325 --> 01:00:54.275
When's she gonna wake up?

01:00:55.205 --> 01:00:56.484
She's under sedation right now.

01:00:56.485 --> 01:00:59.244
She just needs
to get a little rest.

01:00:59.245 --> 01:01:01.548
When's she gonna be conscious?

01:01:01.806 --> 01:01:05.245
It could be three hours,
it could be three days.

01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:06.404
Yeah, but you're a doctor,
so you might...

01:01:06.405 --> 01:01:07.945
Donny.

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.871
Okay.

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:57.755
What happened to you?

01:02:01.124 --> 01:02:03.108
Got into a scuffle.

01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:09.750
Where's Amber?

01:02:10.084 --> 01:02:11.563
I couldn't find her.

01:02:20.484 --> 01:02:21.865
Hello?

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:24.870
What?

01:02:27.404 --> 01:02:29.388
What?

01:02:33.563 --> 01:02:35.149
Yeah.

01:02:36.203 --> 01:02:37.629
Thanks.

01:02:39.203 --> 01:02:40.743
What's wrong?

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:42.463
Amber was attacked.

01:02:43.364 --> 01:02:46.843
Someone beat her
and left her to die in a field.

01:02:46.844 --> 01:02:49.544
Just woke up an hour ago.

01:02:55.763 --> 01:02:57.983
It looks like your
appetite's coming back.

01:02:58.603 --> 01:03:01.224
Be outta here in a couple days.

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:04.706
Oh, I almost forgot...
you've got another visitor.

01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:08.794
How's the patient?

01:03:09.483 --> 01:03:10.842
She's doin' better.

01:03:10.843 --> 01:03:12.429
Good.

01:03:13.443 --> 01:03:16.428
Bet she's ready to get out of here.

01:03:17.203 --> 01:03:19.824
Can you go grab me a soda?

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:22.187
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:03:22.522 --> 01:03:24.347
Be right back.

01:03:38.402 --> 01:03:40.704
You are so beautiful.

01:03:41.402 --> 01:03:43.545
Even all bruised up like that.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:53.911
You know not to tell
anybody about this, right?

01:03:55.001 --> 01:03:57.872
Or I may have to go
and pay a visit to Hannah.

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:01.550
You don't want that.

01:04:06.282 --> 01:04:09.313
I got some shit
I gotta do today, but...

01:04:13.881 --> 01:04:16.388
I can come back and visit later on.

01:04:18.401 --> 01:04:21.272
Would you like that?

01:04:26.002 --> 01:04:27.463
Okay.

01:04:28.761 --> 01:04:30.472
Here you go.

01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:33.061
Okay.

01:04:33.121 --> 01:04:34.547
Random.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:38.270
Want a soda?

01:04:41.241 --> 01:04:42.906
What's wrong?

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.270
Amber, what did he say?

01:04:55.361 --> 01:04:57.425
Was this Bobby?

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.625
Holy shit!

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.186
Shit!

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:28.279
Hey.

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.820
What's the news?

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:30.999
Well, she's awake.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.839
Well, that's good, huh...
That's very good.

01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:34.380
Yeah, very good.

01:05:35.759 --> 01:05:37.299
What... What's up?

01:05:37.719 --> 01:05:39.259
It was Bobby.

01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.679
Bobby?

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.744
Mm-hmm.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:47.639
You sure?

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.829
Positive.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:52.319
Oh, shit.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.718
But look, he's gonna come back

01:05:53.719 --> 01:05:55.118
and he's gonna finish
what he started

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.798
and she is not
gonna be safe, like, what...

01:05:57.799 --> 01:05:58.918
who are you calling?

01:05:58.919 --> 01:05:59.998
The cops.

01:05:59.999 --> 01:06:01.878
No, okay, see, you can't do that.

01:06:01.879 --> 01:06:03.118
Why not?

01:06:03.119 --> 01:06:04.958
Because most of them
work for Uncle Frank.

01:06:04.959 --> 01:06:06.910
I can protect her.

01:06:09.879 --> 01:06:11.510
Well, then, what, huh?

01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:13.259
You seem to have it
all figured out.

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.230
We gotta kill them.

01:06:22.719 --> 01:06:23.918
Kill them?

01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:25.380
Yeah.

01:06:27.558 --> 01:06:29.037
You're all I got right now,

01:06:29.038 --> 01:06:32.678
and I just really you to just
help me, to just do this, okay?

01:06:32.679 --> 01:06:33.878
I can't do that.

01:06:33.879 --> 01:06:35.678
Well, I thought that you loved her.

01:06:35.679 --> 01:06:37.238
Do you not care anymore?

01:06:37.239 --> 01:06:38.358
Of course I care, you know...

01:06:38.359 --> 01:06:39.598
Okay, then why
don't you just kill him?

01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:40.718
- I kill... I can't...
- I don't know, why,

01:06:40.719 --> 01:06:42.118
why, why?

01:06:42.119 --> 01:06:44.989
'Cause I'm a cop.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:48.908
I'm an undercover cop.

01:06:52.838 --> 01:06:54.742
I am a small part...

01:06:56.319 --> 01:06:57.905
of a big operation.

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:01.902
We are this close to
bringing down the Stinsons.

01:07:02.758 --> 01:07:04.077
So let me make a call, all right?

01:07:04.078 --> 01:07:05.517
I-I can protect you.

01:07:05.518 --> 01:07:07.058
You'd be safe.

01:07:08.518 --> 01:07:09.677
You have my word.

01:07:09.678 --> 01:07:11.218
Your word?

01:07:11.998 --> 01:07:13.902
You lied to me!

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:16.757
I'm sorry, Hannah.

01:07:16.758 --> 01:07:18.343
You're sorry?

01:07:18.837 --> 01:07:20.423
No, I'm sorry!

01:07:20.517 --> 01:07:23.105
I'm sorry that I ever trusted you!

01:07:23.798 --> 01:07:25.037
Hannah.

01:07:25.038 --> 01:07:26.988
Stay away from my sister!

01:07:27.678 --> 01:07:29.343
Hannah!

01:07:45.637 --> 01:07:47.269
What do you want?

01:07:47.758 --> 01:07:48.877
I'm kinda busy.

01:07:48.878 --> 01:07:50.906
Yeah, it's about Amber.

01:07:53.677 --> 01:07:54.876
What?

01:07:54.877 --> 01:07:56.542
What about her?

01:07:57.877 --> 01:08:02.076
I think she's getting out
of the hospital in a few days.

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.617
That's good.

01:08:03.997 --> 01:08:05.628
Yeah, that's great.

01:08:07.476 --> 01:08:09.266
We gotta talk.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:15.140
Excuse me.

01:08:15.757 --> 01:08:17.296
What?

01:08:17.997 --> 01:08:19.537
It's Bill.

01:08:25.515 --> 01:08:26.755
God damn it.

01:08:39.877 --> 01:08:41.462
Okay.

01:08:49.475 --> 01:08:50.675
- Anything else?
- No.

01:08:50.676 --> 01:08:52.216
- No?
- No, thanks.

01:09:05.196 --> 01:09:07.194
That's some good shit
right there, huh?

01:09:07.196 --> 01:09:08.675
Tie one off, Bobby?

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:11.661
I swear, Donny,
you're like a goddamn dog.

01:09:12.196 --> 01:09:13.555
Dog, ha.

01:09:13.555 --> 01:09:14.715
That a funny one.

01:09:14.716 --> 01:09:15.874
What, you do tricks?

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:18.754
Sit up and fetch... Beg?

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:22.474
Or do you just lay around in bed
all day, licking your balls?

01:09:22.475 --> 01:09:24.434
You know what,
you're worse than a dog.

01:09:24.435 --> 01:09:27.055
Nothing but a useless
drug addict junkie.

01:09:27.555 --> 01:09:29.995
You ain't gotta talk like that
Bobby, we're all family here.

01:09:29.996 --> 01:09:31.536
You ain't blood.

01:09:31.595 --> 01:09:33.897
You don't get any
special privileges.

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:36.993
Jesse and your sister,
they was married...

01:09:36.995 --> 01:09:39.184
Jesse ain't around no more.

01:09:46.635 --> 01:09:49.062
Maybe I'll just leave you
and Frank, then.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.714
I'd like to see how far you get.

01:09:53.715 --> 01:09:55.824
I got someplace to go.

01:09:59.915 --> 01:10:01.754
You serious?

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.618
I think you're being serious.

01:10:08.594 --> 01:10:09.833
I was just talking,
Bobby, I was just...

01:10:09.834 --> 01:10:11.073
You hiding something?

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:12.614
- No.
- Huh?

01:10:19.755 --> 01:10:22.793
You better tell me,
'cause I'm gonna find out.

01:10:22.794 --> 01:10:24.953
She didn't mean anything by it
Bobby, she didn't know!

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.585
She?

01:11:02.193 --> 01:11:03.712
Ah, ow!

01:11:03.713 --> 01:11:05.253
Hold still.

01:11:06.473 --> 01:11:08.059
Hannah.

01:11:08.553 --> 01:11:10.094
I'm so sorry.

01:11:10.914 --> 01:11:12.193
It's okay.

01:11:12.194 --> 01:11:13.779
No, no, no.

01:11:14.153 --> 01:11:15.739
I told him.

01:11:16.993 --> 01:11:19.899
I told him, he's gonna be
looking for you now.

01:11:23.953 --> 01:11:25.539
Let him.

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:26.832
Okay?

01:11:26.833 --> 01:11:27.912
We're leaving.

01:11:27.913 --> 01:11:31.191
As soon as Amber
gets out of the hospital,

01:11:31.192 --> 01:11:33.574
we'll be out of here, it's fine.

01:11:36.713 --> 01:11:38.583
I can't go.

01:11:40.913 --> 01:11:42.214
What do mean?

01:11:43.113 --> 01:11:44.619
What do you mean you can't?

01:11:46.593 --> 01:11:48.462
I can't leave.

01:11:51.672 --> 01:11:53.212
We're leaving!

01:11:53.872 --> 01:11:56.911
We are leaving, and if
you don't come with us,

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.896
then I'm done with you!

01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:02.498
Done!

01:12:49.831 --> 01:12:51.431
And when you play,

01:12:51.432 --> 01:12:52.972
beware of check.

01:12:53.952 --> 01:12:56.902
Know how to save and give a neck.

01:12:57.551 --> 01:13:00.218
And with a check, beware of mate.

01:13:01.431 --> 01:13:03.733
But chief,
'ware "had-I-wist" too late.

01:13:04.951 --> 01:13:07.936
Lose not the Queen,
for ten to one...

01:13:09.151 --> 01:13:12.374
if she be lost, the game is gone.

01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:34.458
Hannah?

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:37.730
Hannah?

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.376
You in here?

01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:41.052
Hannah?

01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:44.462
Hannah.

01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:49.495
Hannah, get your ass out here!

01:13:52.070 --> 01:13:53.781
Hannah.

01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:23.729
Might-E Glue.

01:14:23.829 --> 01:14:25.460
Thousand and one uses.

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:28.628
Is this your idea of a joke?

01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:30.931
This is for Amber.

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:36.409
Hannah!

01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:38.628
Hannah?

01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:39.788
Hannah!

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:03.255
You sure?

01:15:04.109 --> 01:15:05.535
Yes, sir.

01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:10.813
Absolutely sure?

01:15:12.188 --> 01:15:14.252
Yes, sir.

01:15:19.668 --> 01:15:21.208
Who did it?

01:15:21.948 --> 01:15:23.933
Don't know.

01:15:27.628 --> 01:15:29.373
Never mind.

01:15:31.068 --> 01:15:33.018
I know who did it.

01:16:19.067 --> 01:16:20.937
Go that way.

01:17:31.866 --> 01:17:33.105
Drop it!

01:18:23.305 --> 01:18:25.255
Stop!

01:19:19.984 --> 01:19:21.490
Frank?

01:19:32.983 --> 01:19:35.623
Jesus Christ, Frank, fuck,
that looks real bad.

01:19:35.624 --> 01:19:37.289
We got to get you to a hospital.

01:19:37.584 --> 01:19:39.124
No hospital.

01:19:39.463 --> 01:19:41.094
You fix me here.

01:19:41.503 --> 01:19:43.089
What?

01:19:44.983 --> 01:19:47.650
Got any medical supplies?

01:19:49.023 --> 01:19:51.822
I don't know, I got a first aid kit

01:19:51.823 --> 01:19:53.964
- in the back or something.
- Yeah, that'll do.

01:19:54.503 --> 01:19:57.487
Jesus Christ, Frank,
I ain't a fucking doctor.

01:19:57.822 --> 01:19:59.021
Just get it.

01:19:59.022 --> 01:20:01.166
Get it, Donny.

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:49.060
Fuck... come on.

01:20:59.742 --> 01:21:01.043
Ah.

01:21:07.901 --> 01:21:09.407
What?

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.085
It's for you.

01:21:22.661 --> 01:21:24.372
Oh, God.

01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:33.601
Hey.

01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:35.561
Uncle Frank?

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.686
Any medical supplies?

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:40.259
What for?

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:41.379
I'm hurt.

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:42.921
Who, where?

01:21:43.741 --> 01:21:45.930
Meet me at Denny's.

01:21:48.061 --> 01:21:49.647
<i>Come over now.</i>

01:21:50.541 --> 01:21:51.900
Okay.

01:21:51.901 --> 01:21:54.090
Good girl.

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:00.881
Frank?

01:22:03.140 --> 01:22:05.499
It was her all along, wasn't it?

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.168
- This is a misunderstanding.
- The missing drugs.

01:22:09.021 --> 01:22:13.041
Was this some kind
of plot, the two of you?

01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.124
You want to fuck me over?

01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:23.002
Frank, what are you gonna do?

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:26.081
I'm gonna teach
that bitch a lesson.

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.499
No!

01:22:49.179 --> 01:22:51.004
No, Frank.

01:22:53.099 --> 01:22:54.639
Frank, no!

01:22:54.899 --> 01:22:56.138
Frank!

01:23:33.899 --> 01:23:35.438
Come on.

01:23:36.098 --> 01:23:37.638
No, no, no!

01:24:19.938 --> 01:24:21.842
Sit down.

01:24:34.017 --> 01:24:35.967
Is it true?

01:24:38.697 --> 01:24:40.238
What?

01:24:40.698 --> 01:24:42.284
Bobby.

01:24:43.737 --> 01:24:45.243
Did you kill him?

01:24:47.617 --> 01:24:49.043
Yeah.

01:24:51.817 --> 01:24:53.357
Why?

01:24:54.497 --> 01:24:56.083
Amber?

01:24:56.977 --> 01:24:58.767
That was him.

01:25:01.976 --> 01:25:04.005
Jesus.

01:25:20.776 --> 01:25:22.015
Red phosphorous.

01:25:22.016 --> 01:25:24.762
Benzene, phosphine gas.

01:25:25.016 --> 01:25:28.798
Mix 'em together, you got
a real shit storm on your hands.

01:25:30.617 --> 01:25:32.282
So, what now?

01:25:35.776 --> 01:25:37.885
Now?

01:25:38.856 --> 01:25:41.477
There's only one way it can end.

01:25:42.856 --> 01:25:45.841
Win, or draw.

01:25:52.215 --> 01:25:53.562
Your choice.

01:26:04.856 --> 01:26:06.965
Go.

01:26:51.455 --> 01:26:53.757
One spark, boom.

01:26:58.774 --> 01:26:59.933
Boom.
