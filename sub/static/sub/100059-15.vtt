WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.049
- Good morning, Store 1217.

00:06.093 --> 00:08.356
We have a very exciting
surprise today.

00:08.399 --> 00:11.446
Zephra has sent us a little
break room upgrade

00:11.489 --> 00:14.144
just to say
"Welcome to the Z-Fam."

00:14.188 --> 00:15.493
They asked me to say it
that way,

00:15.537 --> 00:16.929
and I'm happy to.

00:16.973 --> 00:19.062
- Okay, let me guess.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.368
It's a pipe organ.

00:20.411 --> 00:22.239
Oh, my gosh, I can call Judy
from the church

00:22.283 --> 00:23.762
and she'll give us lessons,

00:23.806 --> 00:25.068
though you have to practice

00:25.112 --> 00:26.809
'cause otherwise
you're just wasting her time.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.115
- Don't need Judy.
Not a pipe organ.

00:28.158 --> 00:29.681
- Oh, I like this game.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.943
Is it bigger than a dog?

00:30.987 --> 00:32.336
- It's clearly bigger
than a dog.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.859
- You don't know what dog
I'm thinking of.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.210
- I actually know what it is
'cause I helped set it up.

00:36.253 --> 00:39.082
- Well, we're all about to know
what it is, so--

00:39.126 --> 00:40.692
- I knew from before.
I knew, like, two hours ago.

00:40.736 --> 00:42.868
- Okay, I'm gonna need
more data before I guess.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.000
Otherwise,
you're just giving me

00:44.044 --> 00:45.045
a free chance to be wrong.

00:45.088 --> 00:46.394
- Nobody's asking anybody
to guess.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.048
Okay, Mateo, on three.
Ready?

00:48.091 --> 00:50.006
One--
- It's a cereal bar!

00:51.007 --> 00:52.704
- Mateo, I just said--

00:53.749 --> 00:54.967
It's a cereal bar!

00:55.011 --> 00:56.404
- That's way better than a dog.

00:56.447 --> 00:59.537
- But the dog that I was
thinking of is massive.

00:59.581 --> 01:00.625
- Free cereal?

01:00.669 --> 01:01.757
Boy, you can really tell

01:01.800 --> 01:03.715
we work for a tech company now,
huh?

01:03.759 --> 01:05.108
- It's very disruptive.

01:05.152 --> 01:06.762
- Come on, peeps.
Dig in.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.329
- Wait, wait.

01:08.372 --> 01:10.113
What if I already filled up
on breakfast?

01:10.157 --> 01:11.680
- Just don't eat?

01:11.723 --> 01:13.029
- Ah, man!

01:13.073 --> 01:14.552
- Or, like, eat anyway.

01:14.596 --> 01:15.466
- Yes!

01:15.510 --> 01:17.033
Thanks, Amy.
I owe you one.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.475
- Huh, look at that.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.434
People are literally whistling
while they work.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.566
That cereal really changed
the mood of this place.

01:28.610 --> 01:29.611
- I don't know.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.134
For me, it just pales
in comparison

01:31.178 --> 01:34.355
to the health benefits
and pay raises they gave us.

01:34.398 --> 01:35.878
- What do you--
oh, I get it.

01:35.921 --> 01:36.879
You're being annoying.

01:36.922 --> 01:37.967
It's a small thing,

01:38.010 --> 01:39.316
but it makes peoples' day
better.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.058
- They're just distracting us
with shiny objects.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.407
- Look, Jonah, I get it.

01:43.451 --> 01:45.540
Cloud 9 has trained us
to be very suspicious

01:45.583 --> 01:49.021
of anything corporate does,
but is there a small chance

01:49.065 --> 01:51.372
that this could possibly
just be a gift

01:51.415 --> 01:52.677
to welcome us to the Z-Fam?

01:52.721 --> 01:54.114
- Be careful.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.767
Pretty soon, you're gonna be
saying that unironically.

01:55.811 --> 01:57.073
- Saying what?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.118
Z-Fam?

01:58.161 --> 01:59.336
Z-Fam.
- Stop it.

01:59.380 --> 02:02.078
- Z-Fam.
- People are gonna hear you.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.124
- Ooh, wow.
No annual fee?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.212
Limited time offer?

02:05.255 --> 02:06.430
- Yup, very limited.

02:06.474 --> 02:07.649
That's why the guy
in the picture

02:07.692 --> 02:08.911
has a flip phone.

02:08.954 --> 02:10.739
Hey, Garrett, listen.

02:10.782 --> 02:11.870
The next guest in line,

02:11.914 --> 02:13.350
the one with the Z-System,
steps up,

02:13.394 --> 02:15.135
I need you to act casual.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.440
He's a scam artist.

02:16.484 --> 02:19.139
He's been returning bogus items
for months.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.270
Wow.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.142
Is this, like,
a sting operation?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.186
Can I help?

02:23.230 --> 02:24.318
- You can say thank you

02:24.361 --> 02:25.841
and move along
like a normal person.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.669
- Yeah, okay, got it, got it.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.192
Thank you.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.543
- Hey.

02:32.587 --> 02:33.979
I'd like to return that,
please.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.590
- Oh, sure, no problem.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.592
I do need you to sign a form,
as it is a high-ticket item,

02:37.635 --> 02:39.855
so follow me and I'll get you
your refund ASAP.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.903
- I'm just shopping.

02:47.558 --> 02:49.865
- Do you guys think
this is real Lucky Charms

02:49.908 --> 02:50.822
or the knockoff brand?

02:50.866 --> 02:51.954
- Real.

02:51.997 --> 02:53.434
The fake stuff
turns your milk green.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.045
This milk is true blue, baby.

02:56.088 --> 02:57.089
- Classy move, Zephra.

02:57.133 --> 02:58.526
- Okay, guys, come on.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.571
We're talking about a billion
dollar corporation here.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.225
I mean,
how about giving us stuff

03:02.269 --> 03:04.619
that actually has an impact
on our lives?

03:04.662 --> 03:05.924
- Jonah has a point.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.491
I saw some pictures
of Zephra's headquarters.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.754
It's so big,
they have self-driving cars

03:09.798 --> 03:10.886
to get around the campus.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.235
We should all have those.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.976
We wouldn't have to take
the bus to work.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.238
- Well, I don't know

03:15.282 --> 03:17.022
that they're gonna give
every employee a car,

03:17.066 --> 03:18.676
but what about a living wage?

03:18.720 --> 03:20.156
- Hey!

03:20.200 --> 03:22.202
How are things over here?

03:22.245 --> 03:24.465
Everyone happy
with their cereal?

03:24.508 --> 03:27.511
Yeah, everyone feeling
"Grr-eat?"

03:27.555 --> 03:29.078
- Oh, my gosh.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.212
Speaking of cereal, you sound
just like Tony the Tiger.

03:32.255 --> 03:33.213
Right?
- Yeah.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.257
- You do!
- Just like him.

03:34.301 --> 03:35.693
- Amazing.
- Impressions.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.392
- Yeah, no, I know.
That's what I was trying to--

03:39.654 --> 03:42.222
- Oh, you really flipped
this little closet.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.788
- Thank you.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.529
- Probably gonna have to take
that plant outside for sun

03:45.573 --> 03:46.748
every once in a while though.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.750
- Oh, right.
Sun.

03:48.793 --> 03:49.838
- Mm-hmm.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.056
This is already too much work.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.623
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.451
- But it is better than being
on the floor.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.279
Plus I'm already tapped in

03:56.323 --> 03:58.238
to the assistant gossip
network.

03:58.281 --> 04:01.328
Like, I heard--

04:01.371 --> 04:03.678
Never mind.
I shouldn't say anything.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.332
- Well, you want me to shut
this door for you?

04:05.375 --> 04:06.681
- Okay, fine!

04:06.724 --> 04:07.986
You know how Carol
got suspended

04:08.030 --> 04:10.032
for attempted cat-slaughter?

04:10.075 --> 04:11.076
- Mm-hmm.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.295
- Terri from HR told me

04:12.339 --> 04:14.645
that she got suspended
with pay.

04:14.689 --> 04:15.559
- What?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.518
- I guess it's Zephra policy?

04:17.561 --> 04:19.215
Like, they're so afraid
of a lawsuit,

04:19.259 --> 04:21.435
if they even hear the words
"mental distress,"

04:21.478 --> 04:23.785
they just give you paid leave,
no questions asked.

04:23.828 --> 04:26.091
- Seriously.
- Yeah.

04:26.135 --> 04:30.139
Also, she said that the manager
at Hilldale has a micropenis.

04:30.182 --> 04:33.360
So it's been
a pretty busy morning.

04:33.403 --> 04:35.492
- Please have a seat.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.320
I'll get right to processing
your return.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.104
All I need from you

04:39.148 --> 04:40.932
is a confession.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.283
I know you've been scamming
the store for months.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.069
- What do you got?

04:47.112 --> 04:48.766
Oh.
Well, this is a handsome guy.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.596
But I have no idea
what you're talking about.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.294
- Then you won't mind
if I open this.

04:54.337 --> 04:56.078
- It's your space.

04:56.121 --> 04:57.297
You do you.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.523
Whoa.

05:06.567 --> 05:07.785
Rocks.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.352
It's a good thing
I'm returning that.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.180
You guys should file a
complaint with the company.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.224
- Okay.

05:12.268 --> 05:13.487
Listen...
- Benny.

05:13.530 --> 05:15.402
- Listen, Benny, it's obvious

05:15.445 --> 05:16.751
you've been doing this
for a while.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.709
You've got even weight
distribution with the rocks,

05:18.753 --> 05:21.364
noise dampening padding,
industrial shrink wrap.

05:21.408 --> 05:22.974
- You're impressed.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.062
- Hardly.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.370
- Well, it's a shame
I'm innocent,

05:27.414 --> 05:30.808
because I would love to impress
a woman like you.

05:32.201 --> 05:33.985
You're just flirting with me
to get out of trouble.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.771
- No, I'm flirting with you
to get into trouble.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.340
- Oh.

05:40.383 --> 05:43.386
I feel like I'm in
a full sweat.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.997
I ate some ghost peppers
earlier.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.869
Just on toast.

05:47.912 --> 05:50.045
Like to cleanse the system,

05:50.088 --> 05:53.483
so I should probably just put
my butt over a bowl, and...

05:54.876 --> 05:55.833
- Hey.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.574
So the cereal bar
is running low.

05:57.618 --> 05:59.359
Someone should really be
refilling that.

05:59.402 --> 06:00.751
- Yeah.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.363
I kind of thought that
that someone would be you.

06:03.406 --> 06:07.802
- Right, or maybe, like,
Justine or Sayid.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.500
Anyway, Zephra also asked me
to set up a video conference

06:10.544 --> 06:11.675
in the break room
this afternoon.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.024
- A video conference?
Why?

06:13.068 --> 06:14.983
- The CEO is doing a bunch
of surprise FaceTimes

06:15.026 --> 06:16.071
to Cloud 9s.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.202
Just a five-minute
meet-and-greet.

06:17.246 --> 06:18.682
- Oh.
Okay.

06:18.726 --> 06:22.207
Like, cool.
That's exciting.

06:22.251 --> 06:23.295
- Do you think maybe

06:23.339 --> 06:24.514
they sent us the cereal bar
today

06:24.558 --> 06:27.474
just so we'd be in a good mood
for the call?

06:27.517 --> 06:29.693
- Come on.
No!

06:29.737 --> 06:31.826
Why is everybody being
so cynical about this?

06:31.869 --> 06:34.089
Not everything is always
half empty.

06:34.132 --> 06:36.744
Except the cereal bar is.

06:36.787 --> 06:38.093
- We should really get on that.

06:38.136 --> 06:40.356
- That's right.
- Let me know what you decide.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.098
- No, I decided.
It's you.

06:46.275 --> 06:48.843
- You have to admit,
it is pretty convenient timing.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.148
- Can you just help me
figure out how to play this?

06:50.192 --> 06:52.716
Kira Moon isn't some stodgy
Cloud 9 CEO.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.023
She's young and edgy and fun,

06:55.066 --> 06:56.851
and I think she's progressive.

06:56.894 --> 06:59.593
Look at her profile pic.
It's just a purple square.

06:59.636 --> 07:01.072
That's gotta mean something.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.423
- You know, maybe this could
actually be an opportunity.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.902
- No.
No, Jonah.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.469
No.
I know what you're thinking.

07:06.513 --> 07:07.731
- Oh, come on, I'm just saying,

07:07.775 --> 07:11.039
how often do employees
get to talk to the CEO?

07:11.082 --> 07:13.171
You know, we could bring up
some of our issues.

07:13.215 --> 07:14.912
- And have her first impression
of us

07:14.956 --> 07:17.567
be Veruca Salt
barking out orders?

07:17.611 --> 07:18.742
"But Daddy,

07:18.786 --> 07:20.440
I want health insurance now!"

07:20.483 --> 07:22.833
- That is pretty adorable.
I don't know how they'd say no.

07:22.877 --> 07:25.270
- Look, we're not giving up
on the issues.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.534
It's just--it's just a friendly
welcome call.

07:27.577 --> 07:28.578
It's not the right time.

07:28.622 --> 07:29.579
- Okay.
All right, fine.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.841
Yeah, I get it.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.191
We will wait
for the right time.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.105
- Okay, great.

07:34.149 --> 07:35.803
So we're all just gonna smile

07:35.846 --> 07:38.283
and make a good
first impression.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.503
- Amy, I need to report
an employee theft.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.939
- Hey, it's our cereal.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.506
Who cares if I eat it here
or at home?

07:43.550 --> 07:46.030
- You can't fill up a backpack!
- Fine, take some.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.468
- I don't need your
used cereal.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.731
- Maybe we should just
walk everyone through it.

07:50.774 --> 07:51.993
You know,
not that they're children--

07:52.036 --> 07:53.560
- No, they're children.

07:55.562 --> 07:58.216
- Hey, favor to ask.
What can you do to ugly me up?

07:58.260 --> 08:01.916
Like, pockmarks, unibrow,
fewer eyes, more?

08:01.959 --> 08:03.526
- Well, why do you
wanna look bad?

08:03.570 --> 08:05.746
- I have a scammer in custody
and I need him to confess,

08:05.789 --> 08:08.966
but he's into me, and it's just
gonna make everything go wrong.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.794
I mean, my personality's
a homerun,

08:10.838 --> 08:11.882
so that's not exactly helping.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.449
- Well, if he's already
seen you,

08:13.493 --> 08:14.711
it might be kind of weird

08:14.755 --> 08:16.408
to go back in there
with more face parts.

08:16.452 --> 08:17.888
- That's a really good point.
- Yeah.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.063
- We have to do something.

08:19.107 --> 08:22.153
It's starting to get
very steamy in there.

08:22.197 --> 08:24.416
- Oh, my God.
You like him!

08:24.460 --> 08:26.506
- No, no, no.

08:26.549 --> 08:27.811
- Is he hot?
- Yes!

08:27.855 --> 08:29.596
He's exceptionally hot.

08:29.639 --> 08:33.425
But no, I don't like
criminals, okay?

08:33.469 --> 08:36.733
But try telling that
to my heart and my Hot Pocket.

08:36.777 --> 08:38.082
- Later today,

08:38.126 --> 08:41.956
Kira Moon from Zephra
will be "surprising" us

08:41.999 --> 08:42.957
with a video chat.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.480
- We get to talk to the CEO?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.917
- We should clarify
which Hemsworth she's dating.

08:46.961 --> 08:49.050
- I heard it's not the one
you think it is.

08:49.093 --> 08:52.444
- We should ask if the cereal
was meant to be taken home.

08:52.488 --> 08:53.707
I'm just curious.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.447
- No, we should ask her
for stuff we need,

08:55.491 --> 08:58.668
like self-driving cars,
right, Jonah?

08:58.712 --> 09:00.104
- That was all her--

09:00.148 --> 09:03.847
it's just a friendly call,
Sandra, not an opportunity.

09:03.891 --> 09:05.327
- Exactly.

09:05.370 --> 09:07.590
But you know, Kira might ask
you all some questions,

09:07.634 --> 09:10.027
so I thought it would be good
for us to practice, you know?

09:10.071 --> 09:13.944
Like, Glenn, pretend I'm Kira.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.729
But she's just a normal person.

09:15.772 --> 09:18.340
Just think of it
like you're talking to me.

09:18.383 --> 09:21.691
- "Me" as in you,
or "me" as in her?

09:21.735 --> 09:23.693
- "Me" as in me, Amy.

09:23.737 --> 09:24.825
- But you just said

09:24.868 --> 09:26.566
that I should pretend
that you're her.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.873
- Right, and I'm saying
talk to her like she's me.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.876
- Okay, I should,
or she should?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.443
- Oh, you know what,
I forgot to mention

09:34.486 --> 09:36.314
that not everybody has to be
on this call.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.186
- Oh, thank God.

09:39.274 --> 09:42.190
- ♪ There's nothing else
you can do ♪

09:42.233 --> 09:45.019
♪ I don't know
where you're going ♪

09:45.062 --> 09:47.587
♪ And I don't know why

09:52.679 --> 09:56.247
- Oh, Garrett,
you're so stupid.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.858
Oh, man.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.424
That's embarrassing.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.948
I'm sorry you had to see that,
Glenn.

10:00.991 --> 10:03.646
- Oh, no.
Come on, this is nothing.

10:03.690 --> 10:08.216
I once drove a pallet of Mentos
into a stack of colas.

10:08.259 --> 10:11.045
I thought it was the Rapture.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.524
Is everything okay?

10:12.568 --> 10:14.265
- Yeah, no, I--

10:14.309 --> 10:16.920
things are just really hard
right now.

10:16.964 --> 10:20.402
I'm feeling a lot
of mental distress.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.622
- Oh, really?
I'm--

10:22.665 --> 10:24.319
well, I'm so sorry.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.407
What's going on?

10:25.450 --> 10:27.191
- Just so much.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.932
Unfortunately,
as my supervisor,

10:28.976 --> 10:31.718
you're not allowed to ask.

10:31.761 --> 10:34.851
- Well, is there anything
I can do?

10:34.895 --> 10:37.201
- I mean,
I guess you could grab

10:37.245 --> 10:39.464
the Zephra corporate guidelines
and look up what it says

10:39.508 --> 10:41.162
under
"Employee Mental Distress"?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.120
- Yeah, okay.
All right, look.

10:43.164 --> 10:46.776
You stay right here.
I'm gonna be right back.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.125
- Thank you.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.693
Page 43.
Just a guess.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.825
- Thank you for your patience.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.392
This is Cheyenne,
our head of security.

10:54.436 --> 10:55.480
- Totally.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.482
So let's keep things
professional.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.920
- So look, we have
altered merchandise,

10:59.963 --> 11:01.661
a documented history
of returns.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.706
It'll be easier on yourself
if you confess.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.186
- So you think
that's my best move?

11:05.229 --> 11:06.666
- A lot of people would say
it's your only move.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.537
- Since when do you and I care
about what people say?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.234
- Ooh, so do you guys
know each other?

11:10.278 --> 11:12.584
- I'm not one of the herd,
Dina,

11:12.628 --> 11:13.585
and neither are you.

11:13.629 --> 11:16.110
- Herds are for turds.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.025
- Herds are absolutely
for turds.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.287
I'm stealing that.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.071
- Ah, then you admit
you're a thief.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.334
- Oh, you're good.
- You have no idea.

11:23.378 --> 11:25.728
- So, like, how's this going?

11:25.772 --> 11:27.948
- She's gonna let me walk
so I can take her to dinner.

11:27.991 --> 11:29.079
- Like hell I am.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.692
Cheyenne, what are you doing?
Come on.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.563
- Um...

11:34.606 --> 11:37.044
- Ozark Highlands,
how are we doing?

11:37.087 --> 11:39.829
- Oh, my God!
Everybody, look!

11:39.873 --> 11:42.963
It's--it's Kira Moon,
Zephra's CEO.

11:43.006 --> 11:44.094
- What?
- Hey!

11:44.138 --> 11:46.923
- A household name we all know!

11:46.967 --> 11:50.535
- Just popping in to say hello
to my new Cloud 9 stores.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.667
Amy, right?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.451
- Yes.
Yes, hi, I'm Amy.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.802
Sorry, you just said that.
Sorry, thank you.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.282
- I gotta say, it's fitting
that it's Valentine's Day

11:58.326 --> 12:01.242
'cause I love what's happening
in your store.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.461
Your holiday numbers
were outstanding,

12:03.505 --> 12:05.594
and your rollout
of the Z-tablets

12:05.637 --> 12:07.074
led the region.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.902
Whatever you're doing,
bottle that

12:08.945 --> 12:10.860
because I want it
in my raw water.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.209
- Ha!

12:12.253 --> 12:13.602
- I'm gonna be honest
with you.

12:13.645 --> 12:16.518
Retail's new to me, so you all
are the experts.

12:16.561 --> 12:18.128
Tell me what you think
we could do

12:18.172 --> 12:19.608
to make your lives better.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.220
- Uh...

12:23.264 --> 12:25.266
well, actually,
for a long time now,

12:25.309 --> 12:28.922
we've been trying to get
Cloud 9 to address--

12:28.965 --> 12:30.837
- Address our breakfast needs,

12:30.880 --> 12:34.057
which, by the way,
you killed it today

12:34.101 --> 12:35.276
with the cereal bar.

12:35.319 --> 12:36.799
- And also getting to work
in the morning

12:36.843 --> 12:38.148
can be tough for us, so--

12:38.192 --> 12:42.152
- Which is why it's so great
that we get to arrive

12:42.196 --> 12:44.502
and be greeted
by the cereal bar!

12:44.546 --> 12:45.808
Anyway, that's it.

12:45.852 --> 12:49.159
That's all we wanted to say.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.508
- Okay, then.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.206
You know, well,
I'm getting the signal

12:52.249 --> 12:55.644
I gotta hop on another call,
but we'll do this again soon.

12:58.081 --> 12:59.953
- Wow.

12:59.996 --> 13:01.781
- Hey, guys, I don't know
if Kira noticed,

13:01.824 --> 13:03.826
but my fly was open
for that whole thing.

13:03.870 --> 13:07.699
Like, down and open.
Like, basically framing it.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.315
- Okay, and if you could just
get me that number

13:14.358 --> 13:15.098
by the end of the day,
that'd be great.

13:15.142 --> 13:16.404
Thank you.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.579
- Hey, a customer asked
if the Zephra tablet

13:17.622 --> 13:18.710
is compatible with AirPlay.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.756
- Zephra is compatible
with everything.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.846
We do not question Zephra.
All hail Zephra.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.588
- Is that a yes?
- Don't mind Jonah.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.285
He's just upset that the tablet

13:28.329 --> 13:29.809
won't do everything
he wants it to.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.855
- And it never will if I'm not
allowed to ask it to.

13:32.899 --> 13:35.727
- Would you guys just, like,
get together already?

13:35.771 --> 13:37.338
- God.
- We are together.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.557
- Look, all I'm saying is--

13:42.952 --> 13:44.606
- Oh, crap.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.564
I totally forgot I set this up.

13:46.608 --> 13:47.957
I mean, I know we said

13:48.001 --> 13:49.611
we weren't gonna do anything
for Valentine's Day--

13:49.654 --> 13:51.265
- Oh, okay, so you're allowed
to break an agreement,

13:51.308 --> 13:54.398
but if I do it--wait, is that
the guy from our first date?

13:54.442 --> 13:57.140
- Yes, you said you loved him.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.055
- That was very thoughtful.
- I know.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.927
- Is that gnocchi?
- Yes, your favorite.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.929
- I love gnocchi.
- I know.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.193
- You can't tell your problems
to Glenn the floor supervisor,

14:06.236 --> 14:07.629
so he clocked out.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.457
Now Glenn the friend is here,

14:09.500 --> 14:10.850
and you can tell him
everything.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.634
- Well, you know,
if you must know,

14:12.677 --> 14:16.246
everything is just making me
wanna cry.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.989
It's--every time I see kids.

14:20.033 --> 14:23.558
- Mm-hmm.
- Or adults purchasing items.

14:23.601 --> 14:24.820
- Mm.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.517
- Just everything here at work.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.824
- Well, sounds like you got
a lot going on,

14:28.868 --> 14:30.826
but don't worry,
I have a solution.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.654
- Is it signing
the mental distress forms?

14:32.697 --> 14:34.917
- No, it is not.
It's better.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.919
- Great.
Better's great.

14:46.494 --> 14:49.149
- What information
don't you have?

14:49.192 --> 14:51.803
- Okay.
Yes.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.327
At first, I was trying
to seduce you

14:53.370 --> 14:54.676
into letting me off,

14:54.719 --> 14:57.113
but there's some real chemistry
here.

14:57.157 --> 14:58.506
You're willing
to let all that go?

14:58.549 --> 14:59.899
- You're a thief,

14:59.942 --> 15:01.552
and I'm not about to compromise
my morals

15:01.596 --> 15:05.165
for some completely
earth-crushing,

15:05.208 --> 15:07.036
soul-shattering sex.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.517
- This is about more
than just sex.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.040
But yes,

15:11.084 --> 15:13.782
it would probably feel like
a thunderstorm in our pants.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.480
- Dear God.
- Come on.

15:16.524 --> 15:19.483
Your whole job
is preventing risk.

15:19.527 --> 15:20.876
What if you took one?

15:23.139 --> 15:24.314
- Okay.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.576
Okay, I'll come clean.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.665
I know that you did it,
and I don't even care.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.058
- I knew that you knew.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.799
But that's part of our tango.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.496
So how about dinner?

15:32.540 --> 15:34.194
- Dinner it is.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.325
And breakfast.

15:35.369 --> 15:36.718
Mm.

15:36.761 --> 15:39.329
- The storm shelter
is just a great place

15:39.373 --> 15:40.722
to get things off your chest.

15:40.765 --> 15:41.984
Whenever I have troubles,

15:42.028 --> 15:44.334
I come down here
and I shout 'em out.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.553
- Yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

15:45.596 --> 15:46.902
- Here, watch me.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.643
Why did I have a baby

15:48.686 --> 15:51.472
so late in life?

15:51.515 --> 15:53.256
You know, stuff like that.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.388
- You know, I think

15:54.431 --> 15:55.650
I understand
what you're saying,

15:55.693 --> 15:58.392
but maybe I could use
some more examples.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.568
- Okay, um...

16:00.611 --> 16:02.787
Diabetes stinks!

16:02.831 --> 16:05.399
I think I voted wrong!

16:06.748 --> 16:09.229
I think Ellen DeGeneres
dances too much!

16:09.272 --> 16:11.535
It's unprofessional!

16:11.579 --> 16:13.146
- Still not getting it.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.800
- Oh, hey, is Amy
looking for me?

16:15.844 --> 16:18.586
- No, she's getting cash
to tip an accordion player.

16:18.629 --> 16:19.804
Thank God.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.284
I just came to get
some fresh air.

16:21.328 --> 16:23.417
Everybody thinks
I'm their cereal boy.

16:23.460 --> 16:27.508
Earl just shook an empty bowl
at me and snapped his fingers.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.771
- Hey, Jonah.
I'm doing it.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.338
I'm going
to the Chesterfield store

16:31.381 --> 16:33.035
to get in on their CEO call

16:33.079 --> 16:35.516
and get us our self-driving
cars.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.257
- Again, not our--
oh, no!

16:37.300 --> 16:39.824
Sandra, no!
I don't think you should--

16:41.217 --> 16:45.047
- Amy is not gonna be happy
about this.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.093
I better go tell her.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.965
This job just keeps giving
and giving!

16:53.621 --> 16:55.057
- Your rollout
of the Z-tablets

16:55.101 --> 16:56.276
led the region.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.234
Whatever you're doing,
bottle it up,

16:58.278 --> 16:59.496
'cause I want it
in my raw water.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.976
Sandra. Sandra.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.325
- Sandra.
- Sandra, come here.

17:02.369 --> 17:03.631
both: Come on, come on.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.067
- We have to go.

17:06.547 --> 17:09.028
- I know this year has been
a tough one for...

17:09.071 --> 17:11.247
- Sandra.
- Retail is new to me.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.857
Sandra, come on.
Let's go.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.076
We gotta go.
We gotta go.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.121
- No, stop.
I'm gonna be heard.

17:15.164 --> 17:16.557
- No, you don't have
to be heard.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.428
We gotta leave right now.
- I want a car.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.213
- I understand you want a car,
but she's--

17:20.256 --> 17:22.432
- Okay, Jonah, that's enough.
Come on, let's go.

17:22.476 --> 17:24.434
- Hey, is everything okay
back there?

17:25.392 --> 17:28.090
- Um, yes.
It's all good.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.440
Hey!
Just coming by to say hey.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.007
Hey, Kira.
Hey, everybody.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.096
- You don't--you don't work
at this store?

17:34.140 --> 17:36.533
- No.
No, no, it's Amy Sosa?

17:36.577 --> 17:38.144
From the Ozark Highlands
branch?

17:38.187 --> 17:39.536
We just had our chat?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.277
- Right, the cereal fan.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.975
- You remember.
That's--that's good.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.282
Well, it was nice catching up.
Sandra, let's go.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.979
- No, I have something to say.

17:49.372 --> 17:51.026
I'm Sandra Kaluiokalani,

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
and we demand
self-driving cars.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.292
I know Zephra has them,
so you need to give them to us

17:56.336 --> 17:57.685
so I can stop taking the bus,

17:57.728 --> 18:00.992
where people watch their phones
at full volume

18:01.036 --> 18:03.995
and make me hold their babies
while they change its diapers.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.867
Right, Jonah?

18:05.910 --> 18:07.303
- I'm not on board with--

18:07.347 --> 18:09.175
I didn't even know
the diaper part.

18:09.218 --> 18:10.741
- Oh, I am so sorry.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.917
I am--I'm getting the signal,
so we're out of time,

18:12.961 --> 18:14.876
but it was so great
meeting you all,

18:14.919 --> 18:18.140
and Amy, my next call's
at the Taipei store,

18:18.184 --> 18:19.663
so see you there?

18:21.187 --> 18:22.405
- Real nice.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.146
We were gonna do
our store chant for her.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.017
- We're really sorry.

18:26.061 --> 18:27.193
What's your chant?

18:27.236 --> 18:29.717
- Go, Chesterfield!

18:31.458 --> 18:34.200
- Yeah.
- It's a good chant.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.550
- Okay, so shouting
didn't do the trick,

18:36.593 --> 18:40.597
but how about I take you
on a fishing trip, huh?

18:40.641 --> 18:43.426
Just you and me
and a gentle breeze.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.689
It'll be relaxing.
- I would not like that.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.562
- Oh, yes, you would.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.477
- What are you doing--
no, no, don't do that!

18:50.520 --> 18:52.479
- I'm picking you up
at 5:00 a.m. tomorrow,

18:52.522 --> 18:54.611
come rain or shine,

18:54.655 --> 18:56.744
and unfortunately,
it is supposed to rain.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.354
- Okay, no.
That's not happening.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.878
Look, Glenn,

19:00.922 --> 19:02.315
there are no problems.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.577
I made it all up.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.187
I was just trying to get
some paid time off.

19:05.231 --> 19:08.103
- You lied
about mental distress?

19:10.018 --> 19:11.889
- Yeah, I guess when you say it
like that,

19:11.933 --> 19:14.936
it sounds really bad,
but I just needed a break.

19:14.979 --> 19:15.937
Man, I'm tired.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.504
I just wanted a day off

19:17.547 --> 19:19.723
where I could just sit at home
alone playing video games

19:19.767 --> 19:22.117
and not shower and eat pizza.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.814
- That's how you spend
your days off?

19:23.858 --> 19:27.209
Sitting in your apartment,
alone?

19:27.253 --> 19:29.516
- Well, I mean,
I'm not really alone.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.213
I'm playing with the people
online.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.388
- Of course.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.216
That's basically
like having friends.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.652
- It is!

19:35.696 --> 19:39.352
- Hey, I'm just glad that you
don't have any problems.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.788
- I don't have any.

19:42.311 --> 19:43.747
And I'm not thinking
about my life.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.141
I'm just being quiet
'cause you walked away.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.886
- The cereal's gone.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.192
It was supposed to last
a month,

19:53.235 --> 19:54.454
and those monsters
ate it in a day.

19:54.497 --> 19:56.238
- Oh, my God.
You did it.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.153
You got us cars.
- I did?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.807
- Zephra just sent a mass email

19:59.850 --> 20:02.331
saying that Cloud 9 employees
now get 50% off

20:02.375 --> 20:04.246
all Lyfts nationwide.

20:04.290 --> 20:05.987
- Holy crap.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.597
- Huh.

20:07.641 --> 20:11.775
Okay, well, I guess
I am pleasantly surprised

20:11.819 --> 20:15.518
that Kira seems to have
listened.

20:15.562 --> 20:18.042
- Yeah, she did, didn't she?

20:18.086 --> 20:19.261
Maybe they're different.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.264
- Oh, my God.
Is that a dirty diaper?

20:22.308 --> 20:25.920
- Ugh, God, our customers
are animals.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.443
Oh.

20:27.487 --> 20:30.316
"Happy Valentine's Day,
Grandpa."

20:30.359 --> 20:31.534
- Yeah, well, I had to raid

20:31.578 --> 20:32.970
what was left
of the seasonal aisle.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.189
- Aww.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.495
- If you're gonna break
our agreement--

20:35.538 --> 20:36.931
- It's only fair.

20:36.974 --> 20:39.542
And a half-eaten box
of chocolates.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.849
- Did a coconut check for you.
Took care of 'em.

20:41.892 --> 20:43.590
- Thank you.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.332
Oh, I can still taste the--

20:46.375 --> 20:48.464
- Yeah, I ate, like,
a whole coconut's worth.

20:48.508 --> 20:49.465
- And there was, like,

20:49.509 --> 20:50.858
a little bit of gnocchi
in there.

20:50.901 --> 20:52.773
- Oh, yeah, you don't like that
gnoc-onut vibe?

20:52.816 --> 20:55.166
- Don't say that.
Don't say gnoc-onut.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.995
- Hey, thanks for taking
a chance on me.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.868
- It's Valentine's Day.
I had to follow my heart.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.306
- Nah--

21:04.350 --> 21:06.526
are you kidding me?

21:06.569 --> 21:08.528
- Look, I'm sorry, Benny,
but I had no choice.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.530
This doesn't mean anything
has to change between us.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.096
- Yeah, it kind of does.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.968
- I'll wait for you!

21:14.011 --> 21:16.797
Not sexually, or if I've met
someone else.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.189
- Up yours!

21:18.233 --> 21:20.191
- I wish.
