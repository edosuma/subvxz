YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL
ABOUT HOSPITALS, KITTEN--

05:23.723 --> 05:26.784
THEY KIND OF DEPRESS ME.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.224
YOU OUGHT TO TRY
IT IN HERE

05:28.361 --> 05:30.352
LYING ON YOUR BACK

SHOW UP...

06:07.267 --> 06:08.792

THAT YOU FIGURED I WAS
SOME KIND OF A CUCKOO

06:13.607 --> 06:15.075

07:15.936 --> 07:17.927
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
GET OFF THE DIME?

07:18.071 --> 07:19.561
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH ME.

07:19.706 --> 07:22.266

07:27.314 --> 07:29.510
<i>A LITTLE OVERTIRED,

07:29.649 --> 07:31.674
A LITTLE
OVERWORKED, PERHAPS.

07:31.818 --> 07:33.013
I GUESS
A DANCER'S LIFE

07:33.153 --> 07:34.450
ISN'T THE EASIEST,
IS IT?

07:34.587 --> 07:37.716

LITTLE STRIPPER--

07:43.063 --> 07:44.087
DANCER!

07:44.230 --> 07:45.322

CAME DOVVN THE PIKE.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.193
[staccato laugh]

07:48.601 --> 07:50.626
JUST LISTEN TO HIM
LAUGH, BARNEY.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.296
BOY, HE'S GREAT
FOR YOUR MORALE.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.875
WELL, DOC, WHAT'S IT
GOING TO BE TONIGHT?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.774
A BIG DISCUSSION
ABOUT FREUD AND DREAMS?

07:58.912 --> 08:02.371
YOU DON'T SEEM
INTERESTED IN DREAMS.

08:02.515 --> 08:03.983
IN THIS STORY
YOU RECOUNT,

08:04.117 --> 08:06.552
YOU KEEP REJECTING THE
FACT THAT IT lSA DREAM.

08:06.686 --> 08:08.085
YOU KNOW IT.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.588
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DON'T KNOW IT.

08:10.724 --> 08:13.022
I KNOW QUITE
THE REVERSE.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.025
I SAY IT IS A DREAM.

08:16.563 --> 08:18.258
NOW, LET'S RUN
THROUGH IT AGAIN.

08:24.504 --> 08:28.668
YOU SAY IT ALWAYS HAPPENS
IN PERFECT CHRONOLOGY.

08:28.808 --> 08:30.276
YOU WAKE UP.

08:30.410 --> 08:32.674
YOU FEEL THIRSTY.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.440
YOU REACH FOR THE GLASS.

08:35.582 --> 08:38.482
YOU HEAR THE CLOCK
TICKING LOUDLY.

08:38.618 --> 08:40.813
VERY LOUDLY.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.785
IT UNNERVES YOU.

08:42.922 --> 08:47.519
THE GLASS SLIPS OUT OF YOUR
HAND AND BREAKS ON THE FLOOR.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.992
<i>AND THEN I HEAR THE
FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE.</i>

08:50.130 --> 08:51.461
FOOTSTEPS?

08:51.598 --> 08:53.396
WHOSE FOOTSTEPS?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.297
MISS POWELL
SEEMS TO FEEL

08:55.435 --> 08:57.130
THEY'RE THE FOOTSTEPS
OF A NURSE.

08:57.270 --> 08:59.364
THEY ARE THE FOOTSTEPS
OF A NURSE.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.406
I HEAR THEM.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.000
THEY COME DOVVN THE CORRIDOR
AND STOP OUTSIDE MY DOOR.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.203
I JUMP OUT OF BED.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.609
<i>NOW, MISS POWELL.</i>

09:07.747 --> 09:09.044
I OPEN THE DOOR--

09:09.182 --> 09:11.651
AND I SEE THIS NURSE
GOING INTO AN ELEVATOR.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.275
I FOLLOW HER.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.048
THE ELEVATOR GOES DOWN
TO THE BASEMENT FLOOR.

09:16.189 --> 09:21.320
DOVVN AT THE END OF THE HALL
THERE'S A ROOM: ROOM 22.

09:23.496 --> 09:25.089
WHAT KIND OF ROOM?

09:25.231 --> 09:27.427
IT'S THE
HOSPITAL MORGUE.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.864
MISS POWELL
SEEMS TO FEEL

09:29.002 --> 09:30.663
THE NURSE COMES
OUT OF THE MORGUE,

09:30.804 --> 09:32.499
LOOKS STRAIGHT AT
HER AND SAYS...

09:34.941 --> 09:37.706
"ROOM FOR ONE
MORE, HONEY."

09:37.844 --> 09:40.074
THAT'S WHAT
SHE SAYS, BARNEY:

09:40.213 --> 09:41.874
"ROOM FOR ONE MORE"

09:42.015 --> 09:43.676
AND THEN SHE POINTS
TO THAT ROOM--

09:43.817 --> 09:45.751
THAT ROOM WHERE
ALL THE STIFFS ARE.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.980
ODD DREAM, WOULDN'T
YOU SAY, MR. KAVENER?

09:49.122 --> 09:51.284
THAT'S A
WEIRDO, DOC.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.222
THAT'S A VERY
WEIRD DREAM.

09:53.359 --> 09:55.020
IT ISN'T A DREAM.

09:55.161 --> 09:57.255
MISS POWELL CLAIMS
IT'S ONE OF OUR NURSES

09:57.397 --> 09:59.161
ASSIGNED TO
THE BASEMENT FLOOR.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.357
HOW SHOULD I KNOW

10:00.500 --> 10:02.366
IF IT'S ONE OF
YOUR NURSES OR NOT?

10:02.502 --> 10:04.664
ALL I KNOW IS THIS DAME
COMES OUT OF THAT ROOM,

10:04.804 --> 10:06.397
LOOKS AT ME AND SAYS,

10:06.539 --> 10:08.530
"ROOM FOR
ONE MORE, HONEY."

10:08.675 --> 10:09.836
YOU BRING HER IN HERE.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.102
I'LL POINT HER OUT.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.474
BOY, WILLI
POINT HER OUT.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.742
I KNOW HER FACE AS
WELL AS I DO MY OWN.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.783
VERY WELL.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.010
LET'S SEE.

10:30.830 --> 10:32.924
THIS IS
MISS JAMESON.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.763
SHE'S THE NIGHT NURSE ASSIGNED
TO THE BASEMENT FLOOR.

10:35.902 --> 10:40.032
THE ONLY NURSE, I MIGHT
ADD, MISS POVVELL.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.140
LOOK AT HER.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.408
<i>WELL, MISS POWELL?</i>

10:45.545 --> 10:48.014
IS THIS YOUR
PHANTOM LADY?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.412
<i>NO! THIS
WOMAN IS TALL</i>

10:50.550 --> 10:51.608
AND SHE'S GOT

10:51.751 --> 10:53.412
THIS CRAZY
KIND OF A SMILE

10:53.553 --> 10:54.782
ON HER FACE.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.855
THAT WILL BE
ALL, THANK YOU.

11:00.627 --> 11:04.621
VVELL, MISS POVVELL, IT
OBVIOUSLY IS A DREAM.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.892
IF IT WERE A NURSE
IN OUR HOSPITAL

11:07.033 --> 11:08.728
IT WOULD HAVE TO
BE THAT YOUNG LADY

11:08.868 --> 11:12.327
AND SINCE IT IS NOT,

11:12.472 --> 11:14.531
YOU'LL HAVE TO ADMIT
IT'S VERY UNLIKELY

11:14.674 --> 11:15.732
THAT THE WOMAN
YOU SAW

11:15.875 --> 11:17.741
COULD HAVE COME
OUT OF THE MORGUE.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.402
I KNOW
WHAT I SAW.

11:19.546 --> 11:21.844
I KNOW
WHAT I DID.

11:21.981 --> 11:23.642
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT, MISS POWELL.

11:23.783 --> 11:25.182
TO PROVE MY POINT,

11:25.318 --> 11:28.845
LET'S TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.456
LIKE WHAT?

11:30.590 --> 11:31.887
YOU SAY IT
ALWAYS HAPPENS

11:32.025 --> 11:34.323
IN SUCH
PURE CHRONOLOGY--

11:34.460 --> 11:39.523
<i>THAT YOUR ACTIONS
ARE ALWAYS THE SAME.</i>

11:39.666 --> 11:41.464
TONIGHT WHEN
YOU'RE DREAMING,

11:41.601 --> 11:45.196
<i>OR AS YOU SAY, WHEN
YOU'RE WNQNG UP-</i>

11:45.338 --> 11:47.670
<i>DON'T REACH
FOR THE GLASS.</i>

11:47.807 --> 11:49.400
<i>SEE IF BREAKING
THE ROUTINE OF IT</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:52.773
<i>WON'T STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING.</i>

11:52.912 --> 11:55.643
<i>(Barney) THAT SOUNDS
LIKE A GROOVY IDEA.</i>

11:55.782 --> 11:57.272
<i>WHY DON'T YOU TRY
IT, KITTEN, HUH?</i>

11:57.417 --> 11:58.350
WHY DON'T
YOU TRY IT?

11:58.484 --> 11:59.952
BARNEY, WILL
YOU TELL HIM?

12:00.086 --> 12:01.815
WHEN THE SAME THING
HAPPENS TO YOU

12:01.955 --> 12:03.514
FOR SIX NIGHTS
IN A ROW!

12:03.656 --> 12:07.524
OVERWORK, FATIGUE,
TIREDNESS...

12:07.660 --> 12:09.185
A NIGHTMARE
AT THIS POINT

12:09.329 --> 12:12.230
<i>WOULD NOT BE ABNORMAL, MR.
KAVENER.</i>

12:12.365 --> 12:15.858
A NIGHTMARE IN THIS CASE
VVOULD BE THE NORM.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.528
WELL, MISS POWELL,

12:18.671 --> 12:21.265
LET'S SEE WHAT
THIS EVENING BRINGS.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.603

12:23.743 --> 12:24.835
YEAH, WELL, I...

12:24.978 --> 12:26.503
I GOTTA BE RUNNING
ALONG, KITTEN.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.876
STAY HIP TO VVHAT THE DOC
HERE IS TELLING YOU.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.642
I'M SURE GLAD TO
SEE YOU FEELIN'--

12:30.783 --> 12:33.115
UH, LOOKING

12:33.253 --> 12:35.847
<i>THANKS A
HEAP , BARNEY .</i>

12:35.989 --> 12:38.481
YOU KNOW, YOU
COULDN'T BOOST MORALE

12:38.625 --> 12:40.184
IF IT VVEIGHED A
QUARTER OF A POUND

12:40.326 --> 12:41.794
AND YOU HAD
A DERRICK.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.760
