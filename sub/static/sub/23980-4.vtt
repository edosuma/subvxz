00:02.520 --> 00:04.680
# We're not going out

00:04.680 --> 00:06.520
# Not staying in

00:06.520 --> 00:09.200
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.200 --> 00:12.040
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:12.040 --> 00:15.640
# We're not going out

00:23.720 --> 00:25.760
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

00:25.760 --> 00:27.120
We've got good news!

00:27.120 --> 00:29.560
Don't tell me, your mother is
seeing the window cleaner,

00:29.560 --> 00:32.000
and so he's going to clean
the greenhouse for free.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.120
Mummy said we can get a rabbit!

00:36.000 --> 00:37.920
What♪ No, I didn't.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.360
I said we'd talk to
Daddy about getting a rabbit.

00:42.960 --> 00:46.560
That's not talking,
that's hypnotising.

00:46.560 --> 00:49.160
You stay here while Daddy
and I have a conversation.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.840
I thought we made joint
decisions about things like this.

00:54.840 --> 00:56.840
Well, to begin with,
they wanted a dog.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.440
And I knew you wouldn't want that,

00:58.440 --> 01:00.400
so I thought a rabbit would be
a good compromise.

01:00.400 --> 01:02.560
So, in a way, it was a joint
decision.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.480
It just didn't involve you.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.640
I think the responsibility would be
good for them.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.560
Well, can't we start with something
a little less high-maintenance,

01:10.560 --> 01:13.440
like a goldfish or some cress?

01:13.440 --> 01:15.160
I had rabbits growing up.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.720
Well, I had nits, but I didn't
give them names and little hutches.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.040
Oh come on.

01:20.040 --> 01:23.840
It'll be nice to have a sweet
little sniffle-nosed bunnykins.

01:23.840 --> 01:26.040
And how can you say no to those
little faces?

01:31.800 --> 01:34.960
You shouldn't be
raising their hopes like this
and then disappointing them.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.400
Says the man who promised them
a Harry Potter experience,

01:37.400 --> 01:40.440
then made them sleep in the cupboard
under the stairs.

01:40.440 --> 01:42.760
If we get a rabbit,
shall I tell you what will happen?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.640
One day it will die,
and they will be sad.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.480
Well, that's another good lesson.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.280
It'll prepare the kids for death.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.200
My parents won't live forever,
you know.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.560
They might, just to spite me.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.720
I'm telling you, Lucy,
they will get bored with it,

01:54.720 --> 01:56.960
and we will be the ones who end up
looking after it.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.920
OK, how about this♪ I will
personally make sure they look after

01:59.920 --> 02:02.120
it, and if they don't,
I will look after it.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.120
You won't have to be
involved at all.

02:04.120 --> 02:07.280
Basically the same arrangement
we've got with the childcare.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.800
Hooray!
Nothing's been agreed!

02:13.800 --> 02:17.680
If we do get a pet, do you promise
to look after it properly?

02:17.680 --> 02:21.080
To feed it and clean it
and play with it every day?

02:21.080 --> 02:23.280
Yes.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.480
And do you know what would happen
if you neglected it?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.560
It would die. Exactly.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.200
And it would come back as a ghost

02:29.200 --> 02:31.880
and haunt you for the rest
of your life.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.200
Yeah, if anything does happen
to their grandparents,

02:34.200 --> 02:36.760
let me do the talking.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.560
We'll look after it, we promise.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.080
Please, Daddy.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.960
Well, me and your mother have had
a serious discussion,

02:44.960 --> 02:49.680
and we have made the joint decision
that, yes, you can have a rabbit.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.520
- Now you cheer.
- Hooray!

02:59.080 --> 03:01.800
That was just on the off-chance
you happened to agree.

03:03.000 --> 03:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:13.520 --> 03:15.360
So, why a rescue centre
and not a pet shop?

03:15.360 --> 03:18.360
Because this way we give an animal
a second chance at a good home.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.000
Why do they need a second chance?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.520
What did they do wrong
the first time?

03:22.520 --> 03:26.080
Can I help you♪ Yes, I'd like you to
re-house my husband, please.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.520
I've been spayed.
Not by a vet, by marriage.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.560
Um, we're looking for a rabbit.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.240
Well, have a look round,

03:35.240 --> 03:37.880
find one you like,
and then we'll do the interview.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.960
Oh, we don't need to interview it,
we'll just take the one with
the biggest ears.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.200
Don't worry,
we understand the commitment.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.160
A dog is not just for Christmas
and all that.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.800
I thought you were getting a rabbit.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.520
All right,
a rabbit's not just for...Easter.

03:51.520 --> 03:55.680
It's not Easter. All right,
a rabbit's not just for...

03:55.680 --> 03:58.480
We're not going to kill the rabbit,
is what I'm trying to say.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.200
Mummy, Daddy, we've decided.
We want this one.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.280
Oh! I bet they picked
a really cute one.

04:04.280 --> 04:06.320
I love their sweet little
button noses.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.440
What in God's name is that?!

04:10.680 --> 04:13.720
We love him, Mummy.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.600
But we agreed to get a rabbit,
not a...raw sausage with teeth.

04:20.279 --> 04:22.520
You don't really want that, do you?
Why not?

04:22.520 --> 04:25.360
They say, in London, you're never
more than six feet away from a rat.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.520
At least this way we'll know
exactly where it is.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.000
It's a hairless rat.
It's actually quite rare.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.400
Have you not got one
that's well done?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.920
He's so sweet!

04:35.920 --> 04:37.960
Well, it looks like the kids have
decided.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.880
You don't actually like this thing,
do you?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.680
I think it looks
like a scrotum on legs.

04:42.680 --> 04:45.480
But it's not me that's going to have
to be looking after it, is it?

04:45.480 --> 04:49.480
It's the kids. And if they don't,
you are, because that was the deal.

04:49.480 --> 04:53.000
- We'll take it.
- Hooray!

04:54.080 --> 04:57.600
Right, well, this will just
be for transportation,

04:57.600 --> 05:01.000
but you will need to buy him
a suitable home.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.520
Maybe a glass tank?

05:02.520 --> 05:04.760
You don't do one with tinted
windows, do you?

05:37.680 --> 05:40.360
Take it off!

05:40.360 --> 05:42.120
And the other one.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.240
How's Roland?

05:46.240 --> 05:47.280
His name is Flopsy.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.800
Isn't Flopsy
more of a rabbit's name?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.600
What's he got to flop?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.640
We've made the banner,
we're not changing it now.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.160
Not having second thoughts
about getting a pet, are we, Lucy?

05:57.160 --> 06:00.440
No. Mummy, come here!
Quickly!

06:02.400 --> 06:05.440
Mummy, Flopsy's tummy looks all big.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.640
Pregnant!
I knew something would go wrong.

06:08.640 --> 06:10.040
How can it be pregnant?

06:10.040 --> 06:13.160
I know it's ugly,
but even hairless rats have needs.

06:13.160 --> 06:15.160
It's a male.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.200
I think he's just bloated.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.600
Well, it hasn't pooed
since we brought it home.

06:19.600 --> 06:24.320
How do you know♪ I've been watching
it. I'm not sure I would,
if you were constantly watching me.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.920
Mummy, is Flopsy going to die?

06:26.920 --> 06:30.120
Of course he isn't.
But he does need to see the vet.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.200
I presume I'm taking him.

06:32.200 --> 06:35.720
Well, unless you're going to
Sellotape a sat nav
to his exercise ball.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.800
So, what's the diagnosis?

06:44.800 --> 06:48.800
Congratulations, Lee, we've got
a rat with chronic constipation.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.680
I'd gamble and go for the speedboat.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.800
Doesn't sound too serious.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.520
No, not to you, it doesn't, because
you don't have to deal with it,

06:58.520 --> 07:00.600
that was the agreement, remember?

07:02.680 --> 07:05.120
Deal with what?

07:05.120 --> 07:09.160
If you laugh, or even smile,
I will kill you. Go on.

07:09.160 --> 07:14.040
To stimulate his movements,
every day, I've got to get some

07:14.040 --> 07:18.400
cotton wool and olive oil,
and massage its anus.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.000
That's awful.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.880
Well, at least it explains
the swollen tummy

07:39.880 --> 07:42.440
and the lack of droppings.
Hmm, and the face.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.360
Well?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.120
What♪ Go on, then, in your own time.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.640
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Lee,

08:01.640 --> 08:03.720
but the vet's already
swabbed him for today.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.440
But don't worry, I'll be doing it
first thing tomorrow morning.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.160
I'll just stay here.
I don't want to lose the best seat.

08:37.480 --> 08:43.440
Aww! Oh, you're looking
so grown-up these days, Charlie.

08:43.440 --> 08:45.640
I think we should let you
stay up a bit later.

08:45.640 --> 08:48.720
Maybe give you a bit more
time on the computer?

08:48.720 --> 08:51.200
I think you're old enough now to
start taking more

08:51.200 --> 08:52.840
responsibility for things.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.640
I'm not wiping Flopsy's bum.

08:56.440 --> 08:59.080
Well, just hold him still
while I do it.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.680
It's showtime!

09:08.760 --> 09:11.040
Well, give me a chance.
I've not had a shower yet.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.560
Oh, I would definitely wait
and shower after you've done it.

09:14.560 --> 09:17.560
It's not fair.
Well, we had a deal.

09:17.560 --> 09:21.400
You know what, Lee,
you were right and I was wrong.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.200
Right from the start, you said this
pet would cause trouble.

09:24.200 --> 09:26.000
I should have listened to you.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.760
I'm sorry.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.640
I don't suppose... No chance.

09:33.080 --> 09:38.080
What about if I offered sex?
Well, if you think that will
make him come out, go for it.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.320
Well, I can't do it on my own,
someone needs to hold him.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
Benji! Molly! Charlie!

09:44.960 --> 09:48.400
Why are you not
helping your mother clean Flopsy?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.600
He smells funny.
Of course he smells funny.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.080
I would smell funny
if nobody cleaned me.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.840
You do smell funny.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.280
That is the great smell of Dad.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.360
Other families manage to look
after their pets.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.280
The ones I know get
the cleaner to do it.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.360
Well, unfortunately, we don't have a
woman who cleans our house.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.600
I can't believe you actually
just said that.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.960
Right, I've got to take
the car for an MOT.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.720
You three, help Mummy right now.

10:15.720 --> 10:18.360
But Mummy said we could go to the
aquarium this morning.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.880
Oh, did she♪ Well, she's wrong.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.400
You are getting that olive oil
and those cotton wool pads

10:23.400 --> 10:25.800
and you are taking care of Flopsy.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.480
I mean it, kids,
this is your last chance.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.480
When I get back, I want to be able
to see my face in that rat's bottom.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.240
Don't.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.560
Thanks for picking me
up from the garage, Toby.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.440
No problems,
but I'd better be getting back,

10:42.440 --> 10:44.360
cos I've got a ton of work
to catch up on.

10:44.360 --> 10:48.400
Hang on, don't go yet. I need you to
look up this rat's bumhole.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.640
Hold my calls.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.080
Come on, you're a doctor.
You know about stuff like this.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.000
You're not serious, are you♪ Yeah, I
need you to look up there to see if

10:56.000 --> 10:58.360
Lucy and the kids have done what
they promised to do.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.720
What did they promise they'd do♪ Set
some kind of bizarre treasure hunt?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.160
No, they promised to help cure
the constipation of our new

11:04.160 --> 11:07.520
hairless rat, by stimulating
its anus with olive oil.

11:07.520 --> 11:10.440
Oh, that's annoying. That was going
to be my second guess.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.240
I'm not going anywhere near that.
That is a rodent.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.040
So♪ Rodents can't do you any harm.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.840
I think two-thirds of the population
of medieval Europe would

11:18.840 --> 11:21.440
disagree with you there.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.360
Come on, I'd do the same for you.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.160
You come anywhere near me
with that olive oil...

11:27.160 --> 11:29.640
and I am calling the police.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.240
Well, you're lucky.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.400
You don't have to check, cos this
cotton wool hasn't even been opened!

11:34.400 --> 11:37.040
So clearly Lucy
and the kids have done nothing.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.640
And seeing as you're not
going to help,

11:38.640 --> 11:40.600
it's down to Muggins here to do it.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.280
I knew this would end up bloody
happening! Right, come on.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.960
Come on out. Don't be difficult,
you little sod.

11:47.960 --> 11:51.000
I just want to put some olive
oil up your backside.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.200
And yet still he hides.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.720
Ow! He bit me!

11:56.720 --> 11:59.760
Anna did that to me once,
when I tried to... Right, that's it!

12:01.000 --> 12:02.760
The kids had their warning!

12:02.760 --> 12:04.120
Get back in the car, Toby,

12:04.120 --> 12:06.800
this little fella is going straight
back to the rescue centre.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.640
I am not a taxi service.
Good, because I'm not paying you.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.040
Oh, still here?

12:17.040 --> 12:20.960
Never mind, I'm sure you'll find a
lovely family to take you home soon.

12:22.600 --> 12:25.360
It's me, I was here the other day.
I remember.

12:25.360 --> 12:28.040
You adopted the rat.
Oh, careful.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.480
We haven't actually told him
he was adopted yet.

12:31.480 --> 12:34.800
So what can I do for you?
I'm returning it. Why?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.720
Because I ended up having to
look after it.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.120
That is rather the whole
point of having a pet. Er, no.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.680
The whole point is that the kids
were supposed to look after it,

12:41.680 --> 12:43.960
and if they didn't,
my wife was supposed to do it.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.600
Why♪ Do you see it as woman's work?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.840
No, but we had an agreement.
What agreement?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.920
That if she couldn't find
a better husband,

12:51.920 --> 12:54.680
she'd have to marry a sexist pig.
Can you take it back, please?

12:54.680 --> 12:57.280
We don't take returns.

12:57.280 --> 13:00.760
What if I told you that this rat had
chronic constipation

13:00.760 --> 13:03.800
and had to have its anus stimulated
every day with olive oil?

13:05.080 --> 13:07.680
I'm still not selling it, am I?

13:07.680 --> 13:09.680
We don't take animals back.

13:09.680 --> 13:12.640
We rescue them
from unsuitable households.

13:14.440 --> 13:16.240
Our household is unsuitable.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.960
This isn't the first pet we've had.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.000
We've had loads of things go wrong.
Really?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.240
Yeah, like the budgie incident.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.960
Our kids tried to help it fly
by tipping it out of the upstairs

13:24.960 --> 13:28.080
window. And?
Budgie was the name of our tortoise.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.360
And then there was the incident
with my daughter and the cat.

13:34.360 --> 13:39.320
I won't go into details,
but let's just say my daughter's
new nickname is Curiosity.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.040
And then there was the time my sons
mixed up the words parrot

13:42.040 --> 13:43.800
and pinata.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.040
Give it here.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.000
Hello. Sorry we're back late,
the train was delayed.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.640
Oh, I thought
maybe you'd drowned at the aquarium.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.720
Oh, we haven't been to the aquarium.
Oh, really?

14:02.720 --> 14:05.680
Well, there's something to add to
the list of things you haven't done,

14:05.680 --> 14:09.080
right under "caring for the rat".
You agreed to do it this morning.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.440
We did. What?

14:12.440 --> 14:14.320
After everything you
said before you left,

14:14.320 --> 14:16.200
we had a big talk about Flopsy,
didn't we?

14:16.200 --> 14:19.880
And we decided that you were right,
and so we did the job properly.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.760
But the cotton wool wasn't
even open.

14:21.760 --> 14:24.280
Yeah, well, we thought cotton buds
would probably be better.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.040
You know, the ones on sticks?

14:26.040 --> 14:30.280
Plus, afterwards, Flopsy can use
them to do a little majorette
routine.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.720
Charlie held him
while I swabbed him.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.880
Right. And then we all went
straight back out

14:34.880 --> 14:37.040
and got all this stuff for Flopsy.

14:37.040 --> 14:38.520
Ta-da!

14:40.400 --> 14:43.160
What's this♪ We've got loads
of new toys for him.

14:43.160 --> 14:45.680
And books and DVDs for how
to care for him properly.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.760
We even got him a big new cage.

14:48.760 --> 14:52.720
We paid for it all
with our pocket money. Ahhh.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.480
I helped a bit,
but it was mainly their idea.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.040
And we got you this.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.240
Sorry we didn't look after
Flopsy properly,

15:06.240 --> 15:10.280
but from now on, we definitely will.
I love you, Daddy.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.800
And I'm sorry, too.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.200
I pressured you into getting
Flopsy in the first place.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.680
And you were right - these
things should be decided together.

15:19.680 --> 15:22.320
You'd never make a big decision
about pets without consulting me

15:22.320 --> 15:25.720
first. No.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.080
I love you, too.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.320
We all love you.

15:31.520 --> 15:33.840
Unconditionally?

15:33.840 --> 15:35.520
Where's Flopsy?

15:37.440 --> 15:40.960
Well...when I got back,

15:40.960 --> 15:44.200
I thought you hadn't
looked after him.

15:44.200 --> 15:46.160
Oh, I bet you were fuming.

15:46.160 --> 15:48.720
I was a bit grumpy, yes.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.520
And so I...

15:52.480 --> 15:54.000
What?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.320
So I...decided to clean him myself.

15:57.320 --> 16:02.520
So where is he, then?
He's in the garage. Why?

16:02.520 --> 16:05.280
Well, in case anyone saw me
doing it through the window. Heh.

16:05.280 --> 16:10.120
What goes on between a man and a rat
is a private affair, Your Honour.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.360
Well, let's go and get him
then, kids.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.400
Let's show Flopsy all the new
stuff we've got him. No! Hold it!

16:15.400 --> 16:18.000
He's actually asleep.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.600
After all, he's had his bottom
swabbed twice in one day.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.800
He's totally...wiped out.

16:24.240 --> 16:27.480
Why don't you kids go
and play with your new things

16:27.480 --> 16:32.640
and I...will pop out
and get some...broccoli.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.520
Broccoli♪ Yeah.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.000
I've been Googling rat laxatives.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.880
Just when I thought your search
history couldn't get any weirder.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.400
Is that Toby's Taxis?

16:54.960 --> 16:57.960
Hello. Just swung by again to
pick up my rat.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.320
Your rat?

16:59.320 --> 17:02.880
The one whose anus I've just
massaged with olive oil?

17:02.880 --> 17:04.760
Three times in as many hours,
Flopsy,

17:04.760 --> 17:07.640
don't expect every day to be
this much fun. This isn't your rat.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.960
We rescued this rat from you.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.880
I know, but we've seen the error
of our ways and now we want it back.

17:12.880 --> 17:16.240
No. Look, I lied to you before.

17:16.240 --> 17:18.839
The kids didn't really neglect him,
I made it up.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.440
I just wanted to teach them
a lesson,

17:20.440 --> 17:23.440
but now I've changed my mind. And
what if you changed your mind again?

17:23.440 --> 17:26.000
Would you bring it back
a second time♪ No.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.800
I'd just release it in a field.
I mean, I wouldn't change my mind!

17:29.800 --> 17:32.800
I'm afraid I'll have to ask
you to leave.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.520
All right, what about this?

17:34.520 --> 17:36.600
You pop into the stockroom
for two minutes,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.560
when you get back, the rat's gone.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.360
There's £50 on the counter.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.320
I'll even pop back later with
a cake in the shape of a rat's face.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.040
Mmm, sounds yummy, yeah?

17:48.040 --> 17:51.560
Cujo! Show the man out!

18:00.880 --> 18:03.480
Well?

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
She wouldn't let me have it back.

18:05.480 --> 18:09.440
So, where to now, sir?
Fortnum and Mason?

18:09.440 --> 18:12.920
Or perhaps I can run you to
your club for a game of billiards.

18:12.920 --> 18:16.600
Take me home. I'm just going to have
to tell them the truth.

18:16.600 --> 18:19.160
How do you think Lucy will react?

18:22.520 --> 18:24.560
Bit like that.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.560
What's going on?

18:32.560 --> 18:35.280
I went to get Flopsy
out of the garage and it was locked.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.160
The thing is, I haven't really been
to the broccoli shop.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.040
It's called a greengrocers,
but carry on.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.000
There's something
I need to tell you.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.480
I hope you are not going to tell me
that you got rid of that rat,

18:56.480 --> 18:58.800
after everything those kids
have done today?

18:58.800 --> 19:00.840
Of course I'm not going to
tell you that.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.160
I am going to tell you that...

19:04.760 --> 19:06.680
the rat...died.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.120
What?

19:11.120 --> 19:13.720
I got back from work
and he was just lying there.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.560
Poor Flopsy had become
more of a Stiffsy.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.000
But he seemed fine this morning.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.880
How did he die?

19:23.880 --> 19:27.040
Who knows♪ Old age♪ A virus?

19:27.040 --> 19:29.000
The big C - constipation.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.200
Why didn't you tell us
when we came home?

19:32.200 --> 19:34.320
Oh, I didn't have the heart.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.400
I was going to, but then I thought,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.760
what if it was the initial
lack of care that killed him?

19:38.760 --> 19:41.280
You and the kids would never
forgive yourself.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.040
That's why I suddenly popped out,
to see if I could find a look-alike

19:44.040 --> 19:48.360
replacement. I've been to every pet
shop, but nothing.

19:48.360 --> 19:51.840
Did you try the rescue centre again?
Yes, I did try the rescue centre,

19:51.840 --> 19:55.960
so there's absolutely no point in
ever going back there again. Ever.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.200
So, where's Flopsy now?

20:04.480 --> 20:06.360
I mean its body.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.800
Oh, is he in the garage?

20:09.800 --> 20:12.240
Is that why you locked it
and told us not to go in?

20:12.240 --> 20:15.160
That's exactly why, yes.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.120
Well done, Lee,
that was very thoughtful.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.240
Really, it was no thought
whatsoever.

20:21.200 --> 20:24.360
Well, I think
we should have a funeral.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.280
What?

20:26.280 --> 20:30.200
We wanted the kids to learn about
death, so let's do it properly.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.040
Right now.

20:32.040 --> 20:37.400
Right, well I'll go and box him up,
and you break it gently to the kids.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.920
I'll try.

20:38.920 --> 20:42.080
Death can be very
complicated for a child. Yeah.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.160
It's not
so easy for an adult either.

21:00.880 --> 21:03.480
This will confuse
archaeologists in years to come.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.800
Well, you've all been very brave
and very grown-up about this.

21:10.800 --> 21:13.040
Are there any questions
you'd like to ask?

21:13.040 --> 21:15.880
Can we get a dog now♪ No.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.520
Well, say something. Bow your heads.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.400
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.720
We are gathered here today to
celebrate the short

21:39.720 --> 21:41.720
life of Flopsy the rat.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.480
Flopsy was a kind
and friendly fellow,

21:44.480 --> 21:47.840
and what he lacked in hair,
he gained in attitude.

21:47.840 --> 21:51.360
He had an appetite for life
and a great sense of humour.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.320
And although we know he's up there,
playing in that great sewage

21:55.320 --> 22:00.760
system in the sky, in spirit
we know he's never far away.

22:04.960 --> 22:08.240
Oh, God! Be strong.

22:08.240 --> 22:09.480
Oh, hi, Toby.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.160
Excuse us a moment.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.440
Keep your head
bowed in silent prayer.

22:20.240 --> 22:21.960
Put it away!

22:28.920 --> 22:31.360
What are you doing?
A big favour for you.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.640
I've adopted Flopsy. What?

22:33.640 --> 22:35.840
Well, seeing as you couldn't get him
back, I thought

22:35.840 --> 22:37.920
I would adopt him,
but let you lot have him.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.680
Sole custody.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.000
Maybe I'll just take him to the
pictures once a month.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.800
Why are you lot standing around
a hole♪ We're fracking.

22:46.960 --> 22:50.280
Why do you think♪ I've just
told them lot Flopsy's dead!

22:50.280 --> 22:51.840
Ah.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.920
So what are you going to
do with him?

22:54.920 --> 22:57.720
What am I going to do with him?
Nothing. He's YOUR rat now.

22:57.720 --> 22:58.920
I don't want a rat.

22:58.920 --> 23:01.120
Well, then, take him
back to the rescue centre.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.720
What, and face up to that scary
woman that runs the place?

23:03.720 --> 23:05.440
Well, then, take him
back to your house.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.120
What, and face up to that scary
woman that runs the place?

23:09.120 --> 23:10.760
Sorry to interrupt you, Archbishop,

23:10.760 --> 23:13.520
but can we get on with
the funeral now, please?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.920
Yeah, sure.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.640
Toby just came round when he heard
the awful news about Flopsy.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.760
Yeah, as a doctor,
I wondered if I could help.

23:22.760 --> 23:24.720
How can you help a dead rat?

23:25.800 --> 23:29.000
It's amazing what medical science
can do these days.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.760
In fact, if you left me

23:30.760 --> 23:34.560
with Flopsy's body for just
a couple of minutes... No.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.240
What's in that rodent box?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.200
Nothing. It's empty.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.840
Why have you brought us
an empty rodent box, Toby?

23:45.520 --> 23:50.240
He just wondered if we needed
anything to bury Flopsy in,

23:50.240 --> 23:53.320
but, uh, we've already
got something, so...

23:53.320 --> 23:55.520
you can take it away with you,
thank you.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.800
Of course, some people might ask why
I even own a rodent box.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.920
Some people, yeah, but not us,
we're just grateful you came.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.760
Shall we keep on praying?

24:16.760 --> 24:19.000
Maybe your dad should.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.800
See you later.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.560
Right, let's get this funeral
over with, shall we?

24:27.880 --> 24:30.640
Here lies Flopsy, rest in peace,
may god have mercy on his soul.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.880
Right, show's over. Just a minute.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.440
No point dwelling on the grief,
Lucy, let's get back inside.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.280
Molly's written a poem.

24:39.040 --> 24:42.920
Mummy, do you think Flopsy can hear
the poem from where he is?

24:42.920 --> 24:44.640
Oh, I'm sure he can.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.760
"Flopsy the rat,
you were our friend,

24:47.760 --> 24:51.080
"but now your life is at an end,
You had a sore bottom,

24:51.080 --> 24:53.560
"so we rubbed it with cotton,"

24:53.560 --> 24:56.120
"And now you are dead,
we want a dog instead."

24:57.440 --> 24:59.480
Brilliant! Who wants to go
on the PlayStation?

24:59.480 --> 25:01.240
Me!

25:01.240 --> 25:02.640
Lee!

25:05.040 --> 25:07.320
"Today our hearts are filled
with pain,

25:07.320 --> 25:10.200
"Flopsy,
we wish we could see you again."

25:19.320 --> 25:21.920
Wow, that's a hell of a gift
you've got there, Molly.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.800
Whilst you're at it,
the tumble dryer needs looking at.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.560
Well, the kids seemed
a little shocked.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.720
Yeah, I wonder what caused that.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.360
Oh, hang on, you gave away
their pet, then lied and told them

25:45.360 --> 25:49.240
it was dead, and then had it come
back as a zombie.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.520
Do you reckon that was it?
They'll be fine.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.840
I told them I'd made a mistake
and it turns out Flopsy was
only sleeping.

25:55.840 --> 25:57.880
They've still learned
an important lesson.

25:57.880 --> 25:59.640
Yeah, don't fall asleep near Daddy,

25:59.640 --> 26:02.520
or he might pop you in a dirty old
sock and bury you.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.640
Sorry.

26:04.640 --> 26:08.280
Well, maybe we should all take
care of Flopsy from now on.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.680
And talking of taking
care of Flopsy...

26:10.680 --> 26:13.600
If that's meant as a chat-up line,
you're in for a disappointment.

26:13.600 --> 26:15.920
I think you need to get used to
holding him.

26:15.920 --> 26:19.080
I refer you to my previous answer.

26:19.080 --> 26:21.360
Look who I've brought to bed.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.000
Oh, God!

26:28.680 --> 26:31.160
Well, his constipation seems cured!

26:36.480 --> 26:38.960
# We're not going out

26:38.960 --> 26:40.480
# Not staying in

26:40.480 --> 26:43.040
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

26:43.040 --> 26:46.440
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

26:46.440 --> 26:49.480
# We're not going out
