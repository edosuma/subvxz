<i>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</i>

00:11.358 --> 00:15.668
<i>Let your heart be light</i>

00:15.794 --> 00:16.923
Santa!

00:17.467 --> 00:23.912
<i>From now on
our troubles will be out of sight</i>

00:29.812 --> 00:35.211
<i>Have yourself a merry little Christmas</i>

00:35.629 --> 00:40.107
<i>Make the Yule tide gay</i>

00:41.990 --> 00:43.956
- Happy holidays.
Thank you.

00:44.081 --> 00:45.127
This is nuts.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.927
Yeah, I don't know
whether to laugh or cry.

00:47.052 --> 00:49.521
And if things continue this way,
I'm going to have to bring in chairs

00:49.646 --> 00:50.944
and have Christmas Eve dinner here.

00:51.070 --> 00:52.995
I told you,
you were taking on too much.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.961
- Speaking of which... I'm sorry.
- No.

00:55.086 --> 00:57.807
I have to go in five minutes.
I haven't gotten anything for Ned yet.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.359
Well, at least I'm no longer confused
on whether I should laugh or cry.

01:00.485 --> 01:04.795
- I promise I will come back if I can. I...
- It's fine. I'll close up.

01:04.921 --> 01:08.813
And my Christmas list
will magically take care of itself.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.821
Better hurry up
and pick something out, okay?

01:10.946 --> 01:12.746
We got a lot to do.

01:12.871 --> 01:14.629
Do you think Mommy will like this one?

01:14.754 --> 01:16.302
How much is it?

01:17.140 --> 01:18.186
$25.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.780
Yeah, she'll love it.

01:24.170 --> 01:27.517
- Hey. Is this for your mom?
- Yeah, but don't wrap it.

01:27.643 --> 01:30.948
She likes when I wrap it myself.
I'm a really good wrapper.

01:31.073 --> 01:33.250
I bet you are.

01:37.645 --> 01:41.201
So did you get your letter off
to Santa yet?

01:41.326 --> 01:42.457
Yeah.

01:42.582 --> 01:44.382
I'm sure he'll read it
as soon as he gets it.

01:44.507 --> 01:45.929
I hope so.

01:49.947 --> 01:52.038
- Dad.
- What happened?

01:52.164 --> 01:54.425
Dad, are you okay?

01:54.550 --> 01:57.896
Yeah, I'm all right, buddy.
It's just a little burn.

01:58.023 --> 01:59.990
Why do these things keep happening?

02:00.115 --> 02:04.468
I don't know. That's weird.
It's freezing cold.

02:08.107 --> 02:10.283
It's all right, buddy. Maybe Santa
will bring me another one.

02:10.408 --> 02:13.673
You know what? You really should
have a doctor take a look at that.

02:13.799 --> 02:15.222
So I'll just get these delivered.

02:15.347 --> 02:17.355
I'll wrap them up
and get them to you tomorrow.

02:17.481 --> 02:18.610
That'd be great. Thank you.

02:18.736 --> 02:20.284
Yeah, I just need your signature
right here,

02:20.410 --> 02:23.214
and then I will take care of everything.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.904
What was that about?
That kid looked totally freaked out.

02:29.030 --> 02:30.537
Yeah, for a good reason.

02:30.663 --> 02:32.796
Do you want me to add these
to Ned's delivery list tomorrow?

02:32.922 --> 02:35.726
No, I think this needs my special touch.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.928
Come in from the cold.

02:54.054 --> 02:56.231
I'm from Same As It Never Was.

02:56.356 --> 02:59.452
For a second there, I thought
Santa had gotten young and beautiful.

02:59.577 --> 03:01.713
Tired and frazzled is more like it.

03:01.838 --> 03:03.093
I'm William's mother, Claire.

03:03.218 --> 03:05.018
It's really nice to meet you.
Where should I put these?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.236
Hi, there.
Just put them on the table, I guess.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.746
- Okay.
- Most of them are for my staff.

03:09.872 --> 03:12.257
I'll just have to bring them in tomorrow.

03:12.382 --> 03:14.809
- How's that doing?
- Frost burn apparently.

03:14.934 --> 03:17.028
Doctors had trouble believing
that it was from a PDA.

03:20.835 --> 03:22.676
But I'm right back on that horse.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.894
Yeah, this is William.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.489
Right. Well, we should have included
that in the Chamber's offer.

03:27.615 --> 03:29.330
Yeah, I understand.

03:30.334 --> 03:34.561
- Busy time of year.
- Yes. All of a sudden.

03:35.565 --> 03:37.783
You look cold.
Would you like some tea?

03:37.908 --> 03:39.583
I would love some.

03:54.228 --> 03:57.408
Hey, is this your grandpa?

03:58.329 --> 04:01.843
Yeah, Grandpa Howard,
my father's stepdad.

04:02.975 --> 04:04.564
He looks nice.

04:05.735 --> 04:07.953
So does the tree.
You're doing a great job.

04:08.079 --> 04:13.268
Thanks. You can help if you want.
My dad's getting distracted.

04:14.984 --> 04:16.156
Sure.

04:18.834 --> 04:22.767
- Doesn't your mom want to help?
- She doesn't live here any more.

04:24.650 --> 04:25.989
I'm so sorry.

04:26.114 --> 04:30.090
It's okay.
They still love me, and it's not my fault.

04:30.885 --> 04:34.275
It's just better
that they live apart right now.

04:35.656 --> 04:39.170
My parents were separated, too,
so I know how hard that can be.

04:39.295 --> 04:42.476
They're going to get back together
by Christmas though.

04:42.601 --> 04:44.569
My mom's going to move back in,

04:44.695 --> 04:48.209
or we might just buy a new house
somewhere like Florida,

04:48.334 --> 04:52.686
and start over,
because everybody's happy in Florida.

04:53.816 --> 04:55.324
Sounds nice.

04:58.461 --> 04:59.591
Do you remember at the store

04:59.716 --> 05:02.687
when you said some weird things
were happening to your dad?

05:02.813 --> 05:03.817
Yeah.

05:03.942 --> 05:05.994
What kind of weird things?

05:06.119 --> 05:09.508
I don't know. Things like...

05:11.099 --> 05:14.697
Whoa! Dad! Dad, Dad, look!

05:15.324 --> 05:17.919
Look, this one has a face in it.

05:18.045 --> 05:19.091
Yeah, yeah, it won't matter.

05:19.216 --> 05:20.221
No, if it goes to arbitration,

05:20.346 --> 05:21.393
we'll have over 60%
of the shareholders...

05:21.519 --> 05:24.573
- Can I see?
- Yeah. See? There's a face in it.

05:25.200 --> 05:28.590
That wasn't there last year.
It moves, too.

05:28.716 --> 05:31.100
Yeah, fine. Yeah.
Okay, I got to go.

05:31.226 --> 05:34.030
All right, look, let's stop messing
around here and get this done.

05:34.156 --> 05:35.285
Come on.

05:35.411 --> 05:37.044
Here we go.

05:37.169 --> 05:41.101
It's herbal. I hope you don't mind.
I have some lovely honey...

05:43.027 --> 05:46.374
- Dad! Grandma, help!
William, are you all right?

05:47.128 --> 05:48.341
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

05:48.467 --> 05:49.596
Yeah, really, I'm fine.

05:49.722 --> 05:51.437
I'll get something.

05:53.949 --> 05:56.292
Are you sure you're okay, Dad?

05:56.417 --> 05:59.807
I want him to know
what it's like to lose everything.

06:10.143 --> 06:12.193
<i>Can you see us?</i>

06:41.234 --> 06:43.912
Hey, the after-work rush
is still a couple of hours off.

06:44.038 --> 06:46.799
I can handle this for now if you want
to get a head start on your shopping.

06:46.926 --> 06:49.980
Head start? Head start is shopping
in November, okay?

06:50.105 --> 06:52.449
I'm talking about desperation shopping
right now.

06:52.574 --> 06:55.044
But I have to check out
a couple of things first.

06:55.169 --> 06:59.143
Wait a second. You are not still having
Christmas Eve dinner at your house.

06:59.270 --> 07:01.488
Yes, I am. Don't ask me how.

07:01.613 --> 07:03.998
I'm hoping that Santa Claus will
give me Rachael Ray for Christmas,

07:04.124 --> 07:05.547
and that maybe she can handle it.

07:05.672 --> 07:08.727
Look, I know this may not
be politically correct in your world,

07:08.852 --> 07:11.866
but can't this situation wait
until after the holidays?

07:11.991 --> 07:14.167
By "situation,"
you mean "haunting," correct?

07:14.292 --> 07:16.217
Well, you know, you say tomato, I say...

07:16.343 --> 07:17.807
No, it can't wait.

07:17.932 --> 07:20.862
There's too much anxiety
and negative energy in this house.

07:20.988 --> 07:23.582
This ghost could get very powerful
very fast.

07:23.707 --> 07:25.255
And he really has it out for William.

07:25.381 --> 07:27.306
So, what is it you're looking for?

07:27.432 --> 07:31.617
Anything I can find on William Taylor.
Enemies, deaths of relatives...

07:31.742 --> 07:34.127
The only recent death
I've been able to find is his father,

07:34.253 --> 07:36.429
but I saw a picture of him
at their house, and it's not him.

07:36.555 --> 07:38.061
Something to do with his work?

07:38.186 --> 07:40.738
I hope not. His work is
in mergers and acquisitions.

07:40.864 --> 07:44.296
His company does a lot of takeovers.
I don't know. It's very corporate.

07:44.421 --> 07:47.099
Yeah, well, somebody like that
has a lot of heavy-duty enemies.

07:47.225 --> 07:49.150
Maybe you should concentrate
on the hostile takeovers,

07:49.275 --> 07:52.121
or the people who lost their jobs
in the mergers.

07:52.331 --> 07:55.719
That's a good idea.
At least it would narrow it down.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.569
To about a hundred.

08:17.060 --> 08:18.317
Daddy.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.831
I think someone's in the house.

08:21.956 --> 08:25.347
- What, are you sure?
- Yeah, I heard them downstairs.

08:31.664 --> 08:34.886
Okay. Okay, come here, Riley.

08:35.013 --> 08:37.607
Riley, you get on the phone
and you call 911,

08:37.732 --> 08:39.783
and you do not come out
of this room, okay?

09:41.924 --> 09:43.430
Dad?

09:43.933 --> 09:45.648
What is it?

09:46.234 --> 09:48.033
It's nothing. It's just

09:49.079 --> 09:50.251
a toy.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.352
Everything's fine.
Let's get you back in bed.

09:56.527 --> 09:57.951
How did this get included in my order?

09:58.076 --> 10:00.294
Well, it wasn't in your order
'cause we don't sell those things.

10:00.419 --> 10:01.549
Does that have a remote?

10:01.674 --> 10:03.767
Maybe I should get one of those
for Ned.

10:03.893 --> 10:04.897
Well, you were the only delivery.

10:05.023 --> 10:06.779
The only person
in the house yesterday.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.788
So, now what happened?

10:09.960 --> 10:11.132
I don't know what happened.

10:11.257 --> 10:12.765
I came downstairs,
the box was opened,

10:12.890 --> 10:15.274
and this thing was flying around.

10:20.756 --> 10:23.686
Have you been having
a lot of weird things happen lately?

10:23.812 --> 10:25.527
Yeah. I guess so.

10:26.196 --> 10:30.214
- Has anyone around you died recently?
- My stepfather died two years ago.

10:30.339 --> 10:31.636
- How old was he?
- Eighty-nine.

10:31.761 --> 10:35.319
- Nope, not him.
- What, are you saying that...

10:37.201 --> 10:39.378
Wait a minute. Bruce Spencer.

10:39.503 --> 10:43.101
A guy I worked with once.
And he died in a plane crash.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.358
- Wait.
Excuse me.

10:44.484 --> 10:45.864
What does that
have to do with anything?

10:45.989 --> 10:46.993
Hi.

10:47.119 --> 10:50.550
I'm so sorry. We're just really busy.
Can you give me a day?

10:50.676 --> 10:51.680
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

10:51.806 --> 10:53.312
'Cause I really think that I can help you.

10:53.437 --> 10:57.329
I'm sorry. Hi. All right,
here is what I found in the back.

11:05.029 --> 11:07.037
Honey, I didn't even know
you were home.

11:07.164 --> 11:11.222
Sorry, I just got in. Before I left, we got
a huge delivery that I had to inventory.

11:11.348 --> 11:13.273
Come on. Come on up to bed.

11:13.398 --> 11:16.328
I will. I just have
to nail down something first.

11:16.453 --> 11:17.499
Here it is.

11:17.625 --> 11:19.842
Bruce Spencer was CEO
of the struggling

11:19.968 --> 11:21.893
Barnes & Stowe Properties company.

11:22.019 --> 11:24.613
He was bought out by
the company William Taylor works for.

11:24.738 --> 11:26.622
Then he died in a plane crash.

11:26.747 --> 11:29.467
All right, that's tragic,
but relevant how?

11:29.592 --> 11:31.727
Well, it says here
that Spencer had hit on hard times

11:31.852 --> 11:32.856
since the sale of his company.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.157
He felt cheated.
The company was overvalued.

11:35.284 --> 11:38.045
He ended up losing his house
and pretty much all of his money.

11:38.171 --> 11:41.226
Well, good. So he's the one
who's haunting William Taylor.

11:41.351 --> 11:42.691
Case closed, time to come up.

11:42.816 --> 11:44.699
But he doesn't really look
like my ghost.

11:44.824 --> 11:46.164
Melinda, you're running
yourself ragged.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.294
You got to get some rest.

11:47.419 --> 11:50.766
There's nothing here
that can't wait till tomorrow.

11:52.148 --> 11:54.031
- You're right.
- All right.

11:54.156 --> 11:56.918
I'll pack up and I'll be up in a second.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.019
- Jim?
- Ready and waiting.

12:20.603 --> 12:22.486
Are you Bruce Spencer
by any chance?

12:22.612 --> 12:24.871
No, I'm not Bruce whoever.

12:25.791 --> 12:28.972
- Then who?
- Come on. Who do you think?

12:30.436 --> 12:32.068
No way.

12:32.194 --> 12:34.203
Yep. I'm Santa Claus.

12:38.973 --> 12:40.982
I gotta ask you something.

12:41.107 --> 12:43.576
I don't understand
why you can see me.

12:43.702 --> 12:45.082
Usually only kids can.

12:45.208 --> 12:49.100
- Well, because I can see...
- Hold on, wait for the question.

12:49.225 --> 12:51.191
What I need to know is,

12:51.317 --> 12:54.079
are you here to help me,
or are you just going to get in my way?

12:54.205 --> 12:57.008
Let's talk about you first.
Why do you think you're Santa Claus?

12:57.134 --> 12:59.394
- Why do you think you're you?
- Because I am.

12:59.519 --> 13:01.068
There you go.

13:01.569 --> 13:04.290
Okay, maybe you're confused.

13:04.415 --> 13:07.971
Do you see a light?
Do you need to cross over?

13:08.097 --> 13:12.951
No, what I need to do is all around me.

13:13.746 --> 13:17.136
- Why are you trying to hurt William?
- I'm not hurting William.

13:17.262 --> 13:21.446
I'm helping Riley.
I got a letter from him.

13:21.572 --> 13:25.297
I've been helping kids
for as long as I can remember.

13:25.422 --> 13:28.768
"Dear Santa. Please, I just want
my father back for Christmas. "

13:28.895 --> 13:32.159
- I don't understand.
- And you're telling me I'm confused?

13:32.284 --> 13:35.967
That guy William
is totally disconnecting from his kid.

13:36.092 --> 13:38.811
I'm trying to get him to pay attention
before it's too late.

13:38.938 --> 13:41.323
Every time he gives his kid
the bum's rush,

13:41.449 --> 13:44.251
I try to give him a little correction.

13:45.297 --> 13:48.018
I need to know, am I going
to have a problem with you?

13:48.143 --> 13:52.120
Yes. You need to leave them alone
right now. They're dealing with enough.

13:52.245 --> 13:55.591
So, it's "get in my way. " I thought so.

13:57.852 --> 13:59.735
You told Santa he was confused?

13:59.860 --> 14:01.451
I guess I know
which list you're going on.

14:01.577 --> 14:03.460
This guy is convinced
he's Santa Claus.

14:03.585 --> 14:05.133
Good. I'm glad. I hope he is.

14:05.258 --> 14:07.518
You know why?
I have a bone to pick with Santa Claus.

14:07.643 --> 14:11.075
1982, I asked for a video game.
You know what I got instead?

14:11.200 --> 14:12.206
Sensible shoes.

14:12.331 --> 14:14.883
Will you please focus? I need
to figure out who this guy is,

14:15.008 --> 14:16.347
so I can help him with his delusion.

14:16.473 --> 14:17.979
Look, you've dealt
with spirits like this before.

14:18.106 --> 14:20.699
Remember, you had that one girl ghost
that thought she was Bloody Mary.

14:20.825 --> 14:23.211
True, but she had specific reasons
for taking on that persona

14:23.336 --> 14:25.093
and specific people
that she wanted to haunt.

14:25.219 --> 14:26.934
Well, what's the difference
between that and this guy?

14:27.059 --> 14:28.483
For all we know, this guy,
the way that he died,

14:28.608 --> 14:31.537
something that happened in his life
actually made him think he was Santa.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.551
Yeah, but what? I mean, what is
his attachment to William and Riley?

14:34.676 --> 14:37.270
I mean, Riley writes a letter
wanting his dad back,

14:37.395 --> 14:38.861
but it's his mom who's left the house.

14:38.986 --> 14:40.952
You're being too literal.
This kid feels the distance.

14:41.078 --> 14:45.012
He misses his dad. He's confused.
What he wants back is his family.

14:45.137 --> 14:50.033
So the Santa ghost is going to try
to electrocute and terrorise William?

14:50.159 --> 14:52.963
- That's not very jolly of him, is it?
- You've really been no help at all.

14:53.088 --> 14:55.013
All right, look,
I'll look up Santa Claus ghost

14:55.138 --> 14:59.030
and Christmas items on the computer.
Just what else do you want from me?

14:59.156 --> 15:01.709
Are you coming to my dinner
on Christmas Eve?

15:01.834 --> 15:04.680
- Yeah. No. Too busy.
- With what?

15:04.805 --> 15:06.897
Christmas Eve stuff.
You wouldn't understand.

15:07.023 --> 15:09.199
You know what?
Be at the house at 7:00, okay?

15:09.324 --> 15:11.877
Or I'll kick your Christmas butt.

15:15.559 --> 15:17.400
Charlie Brown would be proud.

15:21.082 --> 15:23.091
<i>In 100 feet, make a right turn.</i>

15:23.217 --> 15:25.853
Yeah, the SOMA people get it Friday.

15:25.979 --> 15:28.782
Okay, right, right.
If not, we're on a plane.

15:28.908 --> 15:30.749
Yeah, I should be almost there.
Have the documents ready.

15:30.875 --> 15:32.925
<i>In 50 feet,
make a left turn.</i>

15:33.050 --> 15:34.682
Except I...

15:34.808 --> 15:37.277
<i>Turn left ahead.
- Wait.</i>

15:37.403 --> 15:39.034
<i>Turn right, then turn left.</i>

15:39.159 --> 15:40.416
Something's messed up.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.922
My GPS is...

15:42.047 --> 15:43.386
<i>Right turn ahead.</i>

15:43.512 --> 15:45.898
I'm nowhere near where
we're supposed to be meeting.

15:46.024 --> 15:47.947
Look, I need to call you back. There's...

15:48.073 --> 15:49.077
I need to pay attention here.

15:49.202 --> 15:51.924
<i>In 100 feet, make a left turn.</i>

15:53.011 --> 15:55.228
<i>In 50 feet, make a left turn.</i>

15:55.899 --> 15:58.326
<i>Destination ahead on your right.</i>

15:58.451 --> 16:02.844
<i>You have reached your destination.
Your route guidance is now complete.</i>

16:23.851 --> 16:25.860
And here's your coffee.

16:41.719 --> 16:44.021
It's just that... I don't know,
you seem to have a handle

16:44.146 --> 16:45.527
on all these weird things
that are happening.

16:45.653 --> 16:47.243
Maybe they'll put that
on my gravestone.

16:47.368 --> 16:50.800
"Melinda Gordon,
who had a handle on weird things. "

16:50.925 --> 16:53.144
So the car just led you there?

16:53.269 --> 16:56.575
Yeah. Yeah. I was supposed be
at a business meeting a half-hour ago.

16:56.700 --> 16:59.588
Everything went foggy,
and then my GPS led me straight

16:59.713 --> 17:01.052
to Village Java,

17:01.679 --> 17:04.442
where I see my wife with another man.

17:06.660 --> 17:11.137
I had a visit last night
from the ghost that's haunting you.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.476
A ghost?

17:13.605 --> 17:17.539
You're telling me I'm being haunted
by a ghost, and you can see it?

17:17.665 --> 17:18.711
Yes.

17:19.925 --> 17:21.640
That might be one weird thing too far.

17:21.765 --> 17:24.904
Look, I know how it sounds,
but it's true.

17:25.029 --> 17:27.373
- Is it Bruce Spencer?
- No.

17:27.498 --> 17:29.130
Who is it?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.767
Let's just say
that I don't exactly know yet.

17:31.893 --> 17:34.235
But maybe he's trying to get
you and your wife back together.

17:35.700 --> 17:38.252
By letting me see her
with another man?

17:38.378 --> 17:41.810
Okay, maybe he's trying to show you
how much you have to lose.

17:41.936 --> 17:44.613
Jane's never had a problem
showing me what I have to lose.

17:44.738 --> 17:47.459
- Meaning?
- That's why we split up.

17:50.263 --> 17:53.317
A few months ago,
I found out she'd had an affair.

17:53.945 --> 17:55.661
It was a long time ago,
but when I did the math,

17:55.787 --> 17:58.757
I realised that it was nine months
before Riley was born.

17:58.882 --> 18:01.226
- So, is Riley...
- I don't know.

18:01.352 --> 18:05.787
I guess I don't know what to think.
I raised him. I've been his dad, but...

18:08.925 --> 18:10.767
I just don't know.

18:11.772 --> 18:13.487
The whole thing's
just one big nightmare.

18:13.613 --> 18:15.035
I'm sorry.

18:16.291 --> 18:19.513
Now, I know what you see
when you look at me.

18:19.638 --> 18:23.614
Just some corporate guy who's
all about work and making money.

18:24.492 --> 18:26.458
But I believed in things.

18:27.003 --> 18:30.225
I believed in Jane like I never...

18:30.350 --> 18:35.330
You were brought to that café
for a reason. Go talk to her.

18:43.239 --> 18:44.411
Jane.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.893
What are you doing here?

18:51.105 --> 18:52.445
I don't know.

18:54.454 --> 18:58.681
- I saw you with that guy.
- Really?

19:00.229 --> 19:02.279
Well, where the hell
were you this morning?

19:02.404 --> 19:05.166
I called you three times.
We had a court hearing, remember?

19:05.292 --> 19:08.640
I know. I just... I couldn't face it.

19:10.355 --> 19:12.322
That guy was my lawyer.

19:14.205 --> 19:15.502
I'm sorry. We can reschedule.

19:15.628 --> 19:20.147
The judge ruled for me, Will.
I'm taking the job in Philly.

19:21.444 --> 19:23.703
And I'm taking Riley with me.

19:25.420 --> 19:29.228
Look, it's close. You can still visit
on weekends if you want.

19:29.939 --> 19:31.948
But you know you've been pulling away
from Riley because...

19:32.073 --> 19:33.453
'Cause he may not be mine.

19:33.579 --> 19:36.006
It's excruciating to watch.

19:36.133 --> 19:39.857
All he wants is his dad, and you treat
him like he's a stranger all of a sudden.

19:39.983 --> 19:41.739
Can't you see
how that makes him feel?

19:41.865 --> 19:45.380
Look, I'm just trying to get through this.

19:46.677 --> 19:49.481
You think I want to feel
the way I'm feeling?

19:49.606 --> 19:51.908
I don't know how to turn it off.

19:52.535 --> 19:54.167
You just ruined everything.

19:54.293 --> 19:57.808
I know what I did, Will.
I would change it if I could.

19:58.896 --> 20:01.574
But we can't make Riley suffer for it.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.629
I can't believe
you actually did a test for paternity.

20:04.754 --> 20:08.228
If you don't like the results,
what are you going to do?

20:08.729 --> 20:10.487
I'd rather have Riley think
his dad's not present

20:10.613 --> 20:12.872
because of the distance in miles,

20:13.542 --> 20:16.346
not because of the distance
in your heart.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.155
You're not trying
to get them back together.

20:30.280 --> 20:32.833
You're trying to tear them apart.

20:33.378 --> 20:36.097
Why would Santa do a thing like that?

20:49.279 --> 20:50.576
You should have seen
the look on his face.

20:50.701 --> 20:53.379
It's like he was rooting
for William and Jane to fight.

20:53.505 --> 20:54.760
Doesn't that all have to do

20:54.886 --> 20:56.642
with him showing William
what he has to lose?

20:56.768 --> 20:59.322
I don't think so.
There's something else going on here.

20:59.447 --> 21:01.874
Hey, wait a minute, didn't you tell me
that Jane had an affair?

21:01.999 --> 21:04.218
Now, what if that guy died,
and he's haunting them both?

21:04.343 --> 21:06.351
I thought about that.
But the age doesn't really match up.

21:06.477 --> 21:08.193
Although it could have
been a May-December thing,

21:08.319 --> 21:10.996
so it's worth checking out. Gravy dish.

21:11.121 --> 21:13.298
Honey, maybe we should
just skip this holiday dinner.

21:13.423 --> 21:15.724
I mean, it's two days away.
I have to work a double, you...

21:15.850 --> 21:19.659
No, we are not cancelling. We are
not going to break tradition, okay?

21:19.784 --> 21:22.671
It's about being organised.
Look, table set. I'm ahead of the game.

21:22.796 --> 21:24.722
And you know what?
Christmas is a few days away,

21:24.848 --> 21:28.865
and there's been a noticeable lack
of Christmas gift hints. What gives?

21:28.990 --> 21:31.500
I have everything I want right here.

21:31.626 --> 21:34.179
Okay, come on.
Name one thing. Just one.

21:34.305 --> 21:35.769
World peace.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.317
Okay, this ghost to cross over,

21:37.443 --> 21:41.042
which is why I have to find out
if Santa is Jane's lover.

21:43.217 --> 21:44.348
Yeah.

21:44.473 --> 21:46.314
- Hang the garland.
- Right.

21:46.900 --> 21:48.573
I'm sorry
about all that drama last night.

21:48.698 --> 21:52.256
Tough situation. I understand.
How's Riley doing with all this?

21:52.382 --> 21:55.939
He's sad. He wishes he could spend
more time with his mother,

21:56.064 --> 21:57.779
but he still seems like a happy kid.

21:57.905 --> 21:59.286
He told me
that his mom's coming back,

21:59.411 --> 22:01.504
and you guys are going
to move to Florida.

22:01.629 --> 22:04.349
Sometimes that kid's
just in his own little world.

22:04.474 --> 22:07.529
I know I don't need to tell you this,
but kids are really sensitive.

22:07.655 --> 22:09.287
Sometimes they can see things
that we don't.

22:09.412 --> 22:10.752
They feel things that we don't.

22:10.878 --> 22:14.517
I'm just trying to get some clarity.
I need to know if I'm his father or not.

22:14.643 --> 22:15.899
Aren't there tests that can be done?

22:16.025 --> 22:19.372
I've done the tests.
But I haven't got the results yet.

22:19.497 --> 22:22.552
So until then, he feels your distance.

22:22.678 --> 22:25.188
Is that why you left me
that message to meet you?

22:25.313 --> 22:27.239
Aren't we both too busy
for a psychology lesson?

22:27.365 --> 22:29.541
I'm just trying to help you.

22:30.294 --> 22:32.386
The man that your wife...

22:33.265 --> 22:34.562
Slept with?

22:36.612 --> 22:37.909
Do you know if he's still alive?

22:38.036 --> 22:41.006
You think
he might be the spirit or whatever?

22:41.131 --> 22:44.019
- It would be good to rule it out.
- Yeah, well you can rule it out.

22:44.145 --> 22:46.613
He's alive and well
and living in San Diego.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.124
With some very nice memories.

22:50.798 --> 22:51.929
Look!

22:53.267 --> 22:54.271
Santa!

22:54.857 --> 22:55.945
So, what do you want for Christmas?

22:56.071 --> 22:57.159
A puppy.

22:57.284 --> 22:58.874
A puppy?

22:59.000 --> 23:01.217
I want a dollhouse.
How about you?

23:01.343 --> 23:02.641
- What do you want?
A teddy bear.

23:02.766 --> 23:04.189
A teddy bear?

23:06.156 --> 23:08.038
I want a roller coaster.

23:08.165 --> 23:09.587
Yeah, me, too.

23:19.881 --> 23:22.308
I know who Santa isn't.
He is not Bruce Spencer,

23:22.433 --> 23:24.860
and he's not the man that
William's wife is having an affair with.

23:24.986 --> 23:27.998
I haven't been able to find anything
about deaths in her family.

23:28.124 --> 23:30.803
Well, here's a novel idea.
Maybe Santa is Santa.

23:30.928 --> 23:32.601
Yeah, except for the fact
that he's a myth.

23:32.727 --> 23:35.489
He's a myth, but maybe also...

23:35.615 --> 23:39.298
Maybe he's a ghost. Now, hear me out.
Maybe Santa's a ghost. Think about it.

23:39.423 --> 23:41.598
Only kids can see him.
He can travel the world in a night.

23:41.725 --> 23:43.272
He can whisper to parents

23:43.398 --> 23:45.323
what little Timmy and Sally want
for Christmas.

23:45.449 --> 23:48.963
You said yourself that all the kids said
that they saw Santa.

23:49.088 --> 23:50.889
Yeah, but that's probably
because he believes it,

23:51.014 --> 23:53.231
and they can feel his energy.

23:53.357 --> 23:55.952
Would Santa make things explode
or tear families apart?

23:56.078 --> 23:57.960
Because that's what
this ghost is doing to William.

23:58.086 --> 24:01.015
He would
if he wanted to teach them a lesson.

24:01.643 --> 24:03.902
Okay. All right. Follow me.

24:04.028 --> 24:06.204
All right. Let's see.
There's a Germanic tribe.

24:06.330 --> 24:08.966
They believe
that Santa Claus is a reformed demon.

24:09.091 --> 24:10.598
He would slither down the chimney,

24:10.723 --> 24:13.778
and he'd see the kids in their beds
and eat them all up.

24:13.903 --> 24:16.164
That's just nasty.
It's not helping us at all, is it?

24:16.289 --> 24:19.092
No, it's really not.
And our ghost is not Santa, okay?

24:19.217 --> 24:20.893
He's just a delusional spirit

24:21.018 --> 24:23.360
that has some kind
of unresolved issues with William.

24:23.486 --> 24:24.909
I know, but he thinks he's Santa,

24:25.034 --> 24:27.545
and considering
the, you know, season, it's delightful.

24:27.671 --> 24:29.219
- Just run with it.
- I don't have time.

24:29.345 --> 24:31.437
I don't have time
because the season is almost over,

24:31.563 --> 24:32.985
and I'm not even ready for it to start.

24:33.110 --> 24:35.957
I need this ghost to cross over
right now.

24:36.083 --> 24:37.128
If this guy isn't Santa,

24:37.253 --> 24:39.429
how did he wind up with the letter
from Riley to his father?

24:39.554 --> 24:41.731
Good question.
Ghosts don't have mailboxes.

24:41.856 --> 24:42.945
They only have what they die with.

24:43.070 --> 24:45.078
Well, that means this ghost
must have died with the letter.

24:45.204 --> 24:47.966
And he's been hanging onto it
because it meant so much to him.

24:48.092 --> 24:49.807
More than he knows.

24:50.476 --> 24:51.858
Wait, you're leading now.
How did that happen?

24:51.984 --> 24:53.489
- I was just leading.
- No, no, think about it.

24:53.615 --> 24:57.298
A letter from a child
probably before Riley was even born.

24:57.424 --> 24:59.850
The ghost is attached to William.

25:00.310 --> 25:04.369
Stepfather! How did I miss that?
I've got to go. You're a genius.

25:04.495 --> 25:07.717
Tell me something I don't know.
Like what just happened.

25:07.843 --> 25:08.931
'Cause I don't know
what just happened.

25:09.307 --> 25:12.320
- Thanks again. And happy holidays.
- Thank you.

25:12.864 --> 25:16.169
You know, we should take advantage
of this lull, and go grab a latte.

25:16.295 --> 25:18.849
- You want one?
- No, I'm good. Thanks.

25:20.061 --> 25:24.539
- Did Ned screw up a delivery?
- Nope, I'm just looking for something.

25:24.665 --> 25:25.920
Okay.

25:40.064 --> 25:41.235
Got you.

25:52.408 --> 25:56.467
Hey, I saw you! In a Christmas bulb!

25:58.141 --> 26:02.033
You're a smart kid, Riley.
Santa likes smart kids.

26:03.957 --> 26:08.310
- You're Santa?
- In the flesh. Pretty much.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.495
How come you're out here by yourself?

26:12.620 --> 26:15.466
- My dad forgets to pick me up.
- What?

26:16.595 --> 26:18.185
That's terrible.

26:18.394 --> 26:21.491
Sometimes he forgets
it's his turn to have me.

26:21.617 --> 26:25.216
But he'll remember,
and he'll pick me up. He always does.

26:26.095 --> 26:27.893
That son of a...

26:29.525 --> 26:32.915
Listen, I just want you
to know that I got your letter.

26:33.710 --> 26:34.840
Letter?

26:34.965 --> 26:37.769
And I'm going to take care of this
for you.

26:37.895 --> 26:39.610
- What?
- Your dad.

26:40.530 --> 26:42.707
You're not going to hurt him, are you?

26:42.832 --> 26:46.641
No, Riley. I'm going to make sure
you get what you want.

26:48.105 --> 26:50.531
I just want him to like me again.

26:53.712 --> 26:56.097
You leave this with Santa, okay?

26:56.558 --> 26:57.939
Okay, Santa.

27:08.023 --> 27:10.952
- Put on your seatbelt.
- Bye, Santa!

27:20.409 --> 27:22.292
I know who you are.

27:23.548 --> 27:25.849
And I really need to talk to you.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.319
I can help you.

27:28.905 --> 27:31.749
How can you help me
when you don't believe in me?

27:31.875 --> 27:36.143
I know that you're really confused.
You don't know why you're here.

27:36.269 --> 27:39.031
Of course I do.
To give Riley his Christmas wish.

27:39.156 --> 27:42.546
I showed you the letter, didn't I?
It's a real heartbreaker.

27:42.671 --> 27:45.266
Speaking of which, how did you get it?

27:47.442 --> 27:51.334
You know, I'm not sure. I just...
Well, it seems like I've always had it.

27:51.459 --> 27:53.509
You have always had it.

27:53.636 --> 27:57.317
Especially since you died.
But the letter's not from Riley.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.912
- What?
- That's William's letter.

28:00.038 --> 28:02.966
He wrote it when he was a little boy.

28:03.092 --> 28:05.813
He still does the funny thing
with his "R's".

28:05.938 --> 28:07.904
Wait.

28:08.030 --> 28:11.043
No. That doesn't make any sense.

28:11.168 --> 28:15.939
It does if you're William's father.
And Riley is really your grandson.

28:16.734 --> 28:17.822
What?

28:18.993 --> 28:20.375
How the hell do you figure that?

28:20.500 --> 28:23.387
Well, at first, when I was first trying
to figure out who was haunting William,

28:23.512 --> 28:25.396
I looked at all the family members.

28:25.522 --> 28:27.739
I had forgotten that he said
something about a stepfather.

28:27.865 --> 28:30.460
But I never even thought
to look for a birth father.

28:30.585 --> 28:31.966
So?

28:32.091 --> 28:35.272
So, I think
that you're William's birth father.

28:36.443 --> 28:37.573
That's nuts!

28:37.698 --> 28:42.009
He gave you that letter before you died,
and it broke your heart.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.356
That's why you haven't crossed over.

28:45.481 --> 28:49.583
Look, I know that you think
you're Santa Claus, but you're not.

28:50.712 --> 28:54.312
You're just a lonely little boy's father
who's come back to reconcile with him,

28:54.437 --> 28:56.614
and I can help you do that.

28:57.952 --> 29:00.839
You are so on my bad list.

29:01.761 --> 29:04.521
- Please, okay, let's just...
- No, no.

29:04.648 --> 29:06.740
I am Santa Claus.

29:07.786 --> 29:13.560
And this is why only kids can see me.
Adults have lost their ability to believe!

29:13.686 --> 29:16.113
You would be amazed
at some of the things I believe.

29:16.238 --> 29:19.419
I'm not going to waste
any more time on you. Get lost.

29:19.545 --> 29:21.343
This is my place.

29:22.725 --> 29:24.148
Yeah, well...

29:24.273 --> 29:26.239
You're not Santa Claus.

29:27.663 --> 29:31.010
I guess I'm just going
to have to make you believe.

29:40.550 --> 29:44.527
William wanted to have holiday dinner
together for Riley's sake.

29:45.447 --> 29:47.539
Bless his heart.

29:47.664 --> 29:50.594
I feel like I've been cooking all week.

29:53.649 --> 29:55.615
Is everything all right?

29:56.536 --> 29:58.084
I'm not sure.

30:00.386 --> 30:02.854
Could I ask you a personal question?

30:03.022 --> 30:04.278
Okay.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.997
Your husband
was William's stepfather, right?

30:07.123 --> 30:08.336
Yes.

30:08.462 --> 30:11.516
So William's birth father
was your first husband?

30:12.354 --> 30:13.358
What's this about?

30:13.483 --> 30:17.124
You know that weird things
have been happening to William.

30:17.626 --> 30:19.551
I think it has something to do
with his father.

30:19.677 --> 30:23.108
- And this has what to do with you?
- Nothing. Everything.

30:23.233 --> 30:24.782
Look, if you could just trust me,

30:24.908 --> 30:27.585
I really think that I could help William.
And Riley, too.

30:27.710 --> 30:29.719
Well, I don't see how.

30:33.862 --> 30:36.331
It's really pretty simple.

30:36.457 --> 30:39.846
My first husband abandoned us
when William was five.

30:39.971 --> 30:43.152
I'm so sorry. What was his name?

30:43.738 --> 30:45.663
Alan Silver.

30:47.044 --> 30:51.395
Five years later, I remarried. That's why
William's last name is Taylor.

30:52.902 --> 30:55.664
Alan and I weren't right from the start.

30:55.790 --> 30:59.806
I think having a family
just made him feel trapped.

31:01.648 --> 31:03.447
So he got un-trapped.

31:03.573 --> 31:06.586
That must have been really hard
on you and William.

31:06.712 --> 31:09.514
He asked about his dad all the time.

31:09.640 --> 31:12.277
Where was he?
Why wasn't he with us?

31:15.038 --> 31:16.209
So, I...

31:17.173 --> 31:19.641
I created a myth about Alan.

31:21.860 --> 31:25.751
<i>Told William his father did
important work all over the world.</i>

31:27.216 --> 31:30.688
<i>He used to try and track
where his father was on a map.</i>

31:31.651 --> 31:36.129
<i>He was so sure he was going
to come home to us someday.</i>

31:37.216 --> 31:41.150
The lie just got bigger and bigger,
and I didn't know where to stop.

31:41.652 --> 31:44.037
The truth would have crushed him.

31:45.962 --> 31:49.268
Christmas was the hardest time.

31:50.398 --> 31:52.616
I used to wrap up a present

31:53.369 --> 31:56.508
and put it under the tree
like it was from his dad.

31:56.842 --> 32:01.152
His little face would just light up
when he'd open it.

32:02.742 --> 32:05.713
And then one year,
he just wouldn't open the present

32:05.838 --> 32:07.889
I told him was from his dad.

32:09.647 --> 32:11.279
And after that,

32:12.910 --> 32:15.589
he never asked about his father again.

32:16.174 --> 32:18.518
I'm sure that he stopped asking,

32:19.188 --> 32:22.075
but I bet he never stopped
thinking of him.

32:26.134 --> 32:29.608
Did William ever write a letter
to his father?

32:32.453 --> 32:34.963
<i>It wasn't a letter to his father.</i>

32:46.889 --> 32:49.525
<i>It was like a knife through my heart.</i>

32:50.405 --> 32:54.547
I felt like I had to do something,
so I found out where Alan lived,

32:55.175 --> 32:57.225
and I sent him the letter.

32:58.773 --> 33:00.447
No response.

33:02.372 --> 33:04.297
I'm pretty sure he got it.

33:05.720 --> 33:08.147
And I bet it really touched him.

33:08.984 --> 33:11.160
Just not enough, I guess.

33:16.013 --> 33:19.152
Here he is. Alan Silver.
Died of heart failure in '97.

33:19.278 --> 33:20.491
Wow, this guy made it big.

33:20.617 --> 33:23.421
He founded Nature for Life,
those great organic coffees and teas.

33:23.547 --> 33:24.551
I love that stuff.

33:24.676 --> 33:26.894
Yeah. And it says here
he became a multi-millionaire

33:27.020 --> 33:28.066
when they took the company public.

33:28.191 --> 33:29.488
The irony is he couldn't handle it.

33:29.613 --> 33:31.958
See, he just wanted to have
this little hippie company, you know?

33:32.083 --> 33:34.217
And then suddenly,
he was a rich capitalist.

33:34.343 --> 33:35.388
He had a nervous breakdown.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.360
You know, I remember that guy.
He gave away all his money.

33:38.486 --> 33:40.452
Not only his money,
but his houses, cars.

33:40.577 --> 33:43.926
He gained weight, grew a beard
and stopped cutting his hair.

33:44.051 --> 33:45.641
Santa.

33:45.766 --> 33:46.938
That's got to be it. Right?

33:47.063 --> 33:50.453
I mean, he lost his mind,
started to think that he was...

33:51.541 --> 33:53.550
- This is going to be a minute.
- Yeah, I can see that.

33:53.676 --> 33:55.809
You know what? I'm just gonna
take care of the orders downstairs.

33:55.935 --> 33:57.148
Okay.

34:01.542 --> 34:03.593
So why would you do that
to my mother?

34:03.719 --> 34:05.434
Make her remember all that crap
from the past?

34:05.559 --> 34:07.776
I didn't mean to cause her any pain.
I was just trying to help.

34:07.903 --> 34:09.786
It's like I told you.
You have a ghost attached to you.

34:09.911 --> 34:11.083
Yeah, so you said.

34:11.208 --> 34:13.762
It's your father. Your real father.

34:14.891 --> 34:16.188
My real father?

34:16.313 --> 34:18.531
You mean the guy who raised me?
Who was always there for me?

34:18.658 --> 34:21.503
Okay. It's your birth father.
He got a letter from you,

34:21.628 --> 34:23.762
one that you wrote to Santa Claus
when you were a little boy.

34:23.888 --> 34:26.524
Look, it's a long story, but after he died,

34:26.650 --> 34:29.245
he got really confused, and he thought
that the letter was from Riley,

34:29.370 --> 34:30.373
and then he thought
that he was supposed

34:30.500 --> 34:31.880
to get you to spend more time
with your son...

34:32.005 --> 34:33.051
Wait... Wait a minute.

34:33.177 --> 34:36.775
Why would he think
that he was getting a letter from Riley?

34:37.529 --> 34:39.998
Because he thinks he's Santa Claus.

34:40.292 --> 34:42.509
Because he doesn't know
that he's your father.

34:42.634 --> 34:45.940
And why would he... Why would
anyone think they're Santa Claus?

34:46.067 --> 34:47.907
Because I think that...

34:48.033 --> 34:50.710
I don't know. I think
he kind of went crazy before he died.

34:50.835 --> 34:52.761
You know, he gave up
all of his money, his possessions,

34:52.887 --> 34:55.983
and I guess that made him think
he was Santa.

34:56.110 --> 34:59.373
This is great. So you're telling me
that my dead father,

34:59.498 --> 35:01.298
who never gave a damn
about his family,

35:01.423 --> 35:03.934
is now haunting me because
he thinks he's Santa Claus.

35:04.059 --> 35:07.784
I really believe that he's haunting you
because he wants to make things right.

35:07.909 --> 35:10.630
Please. My father was a no-show,

35:10.755 --> 35:13.809
my mother lied about it,
and I think you're lying right now.

35:13.935 --> 35:16.572
So just stay the hell away from me.

35:17.659 --> 35:21.007
And by the way, Merry Christmas.
Ho-ho-ho.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.644
Oh, no.

35:25.066 --> 35:26.364
It's true.

35:26.531 --> 35:29.669
I can see it now.
I'm not who I thought I was.

35:33.770 --> 35:35.443
What's going on?

35:36.573 --> 35:37.871
Great.

35:41.260 --> 35:45.361
William, wait!
I know this is a lot to deal with.

35:45.486 --> 35:46.951
You think?

35:47.538 --> 35:50.340
But it's Christmas.
Can't you find a little forgiveness?

35:50.467 --> 35:52.894
Look, you're talking to the wrong guy
about Christmas.

35:53.020 --> 35:55.655
There's only one Christmas
I remember.

35:56.450 --> 35:59.714
<i>My mother was in the living room
wrapping a gift.</i>

36:01.096 --> 36:05.071
<i>I watched her sign the card
and put the present under the tree.</i>

36:06.242 --> 36:09.464
<i>When she left,
I went to see what it said.</i>

36:22.855 --> 36:26.119
<i>See, that's when I realised
it was all made up.</i>

36:28.503 --> 36:30.094
<i>And none of it was real.</i>

36:30.847 --> 36:33.149
I stopped asking about my father
after that.

36:33.274 --> 36:36.831
- So the plane did mean something.
- Yeah, it meant it was all a lie.

36:36.957 --> 36:39.971
My father lied.
My mother lied. My wife lied.

36:40.096 --> 36:43.527
The whole idea about me
being Riley's father might be a lie.

36:44.322 --> 36:45.996
Nobody thinks
I'm worth telling the truth to.

36:46.122 --> 36:47.962
Okay, you know what?
You can't look at it that way, it...

36:48.088 --> 36:51.310
I just want to know the truth.
That's all I want.

36:51.770 --> 36:54.574
Someone to tell me just one true thing.

36:58.048 --> 36:59.553
William.

37:01.939 --> 37:04.700
That's your son.
You do understand that?

37:07.964 --> 37:11.104
You had a nervous breakdown
before you died.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.530
And I think it was out of guilt.

37:14.450 --> 37:16.334
You gave everything away.

37:17.631 --> 37:20.643
You didn't even know
what you were making up for.

37:21.648 --> 37:23.447
I threw away my wife,

37:24.744 --> 37:26.335
my son.

37:26.837 --> 37:28.636
It's not too late, Alan.

37:29.724 --> 37:31.399
It's never too late.

37:42.404 --> 37:45.793
The Christmas lights
just all of a sudden went out.

37:45.918 --> 37:48.722
I mean, it couldn't happen
at a worse time.

37:48.847 --> 37:51.442
Riley and Jane
are going to be here any minute.

37:51.567 --> 37:56.673
Dinner's almost ready.
I'm so, so glad you made it home.

37:58.431 --> 37:59.811
Is that...

38:02.908 --> 38:04.665
The test results.

38:22.910 --> 38:24.794
I had no idea you knew.

38:25.505 --> 38:27.345
I'm so sorry, William.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.605
You should have told me the truth, Ma.

38:29.731 --> 38:32.409
All those years, all those hopes.

38:32.535 --> 38:34.502
Okay, look, this isn't about blame.

38:34.627 --> 38:36.468
And whether you two believe it or not,

38:36.594 --> 38:39.858
it's not going to change the fact
that Alan is here.

38:39.984 --> 38:43.331
And he deserves a chance
to try to make things right.

38:43.456 --> 38:45.716
How? How could he do that?

38:49.021 --> 38:52.286
Tell Will I'm sorry
he had to deal with so many lies.

38:52.411 --> 38:55.508
But the truth he's looking for
exists in one of those lies.

38:55.634 --> 38:59.022
He wants you to know that the truth
you want is in one of the lies.

38:59.148 --> 39:02.957
Your mother made up stories about me
because she loved you.

39:03.710 --> 39:08.480
She knew that every boy
needs a father, real or imagined.

39:08.605 --> 39:09.819
Your mother made up those stories

39:09.944 --> 39:12.665
because she knew
that you needed a father.

39:13.208 --> 39:15.678
She did it because she loved you.

39:19.736 --> 39:21.703
Is my dad really here?

39:22.540 --> 39:25.972
Your problem is
you're so busy looking for the lie,

39:26.097 --> 39:27.562
you can't see the truth.

39:27.687 --> 39:29.737
And he's telling you that
you're so busy looking for the lie

39:29.863 --> 39:31.621
that you can't see the truth.

39:31.746 --> 39:33.253
Your son.

39:33.379 --> 39:36.893
Maybe he's yours, maybe he's not,
but you're his.

39:37.019 --> 39:41.119
You're the only dad he has.
Your son is the truth. He's your truth.

39:41.999 --> 39:44.634
Your son is the only truth that matters.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.359
If you love your son right now,
that's all that counts.

39:48.484 --> 39:52.502
If you love your wife right now,
that's all that counts.

39:52.628 --> 39:55.180
The rest is just clutter.

39:55.932 --> 40:00.913
He's telling you to let go of the past.
He wants you to listen to your heart,

40:01.038 --> 40:03.215
and if you love your son,
and you love your wife,

40:03.340 --> 40:05.599
then that's all that matters.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.909
The past, the rest, it's just clutter.

40:10.663 --> 40:12.839
But why'd you leave me, Dad?

40:14.931 --> 40:16.981
Where's the truth in that?

40:18.488 --> 40:20.957
Because I didn't know what I had.

40:23.761 --> 40:26.146
Because he didn't know what he had.

40:29.075 --> 40:31.502
Daddy, Grandma, look what we got!

40:31.628 --> 40:34.473
And Mom said
I can open them all tonight!

40:40.917 --> 40:44.349
- Merry Christmas, pal.
- Merry Christmas, Daddy.

40:46.064 --> 40:48.449
Dad, we found this by the door.

40:52.299 --> 40:55.606
That's just clutter, pal.
It doesn't mean a thing.

41:06.067 --> 41:09.163
Well, I think Dad has some presents
under the tree for you.

41:09.288 --> 41:11.004
Yeah, come on.

41:12.552 --> 41:14.059
Jane, let me help you with that.

41:14.184 --> 41:15.231
Wow.

41:15.357 --> 41:18.494
- You're back on my good list.
- Thanks, Santa.

41:18.620 --> 41:21.173
Grandma, which one
should I open first?

41:21.298 --> 41:23.391
Riley, open Grandma's.

41:25.608 --> 41:26.990
Perfect!

41:46.573 --> 41:48.832
Well, the good news is
the case is closed.

41:48.959 --> 41:51.469
Now I just have to go make sure
all the deliveries went out,

41:51.595 --> 41:54.356
and then I will be home.

41:54.482 --> 41:55.946
Did you get a chance to call everyone?

41:56.072 --> 41:58.290
<i>Yeah, everyone understood
you were too busy to cook.</i>

41:58.416 --> 41:59.461
This just kills me.

41:59.587 --> 42:01.596
I mean, it doesn't even feel
like Christmas without friends,

42:01.722 --> 42:04.818
and all the Christmas lights
are still out here.

42:04.943 --> 42:06.910
Everything looks so glum.

42:07.036 --> 42:08.375
<i>Not at all.</i>

42:09.379 --> 42:11.053
<i>You look beautiful.</i>

42:11.554 --> 42:12.685
What?

42:23.690 --> 42:25.573
Hey, here she comes.

42:29.925 --> 42:31.012
Hi!

42:32.394 --> 42:37.206
- It's potluck. I hope you don't mind.
- Mind? This is the best gift ever.

42:39.801 --> 42:42.437
Here you go. Hang on a second.

42:43.986 --> 42:45.492
Toast time.

42:48.672 --> 42:53.945
To my wife, to our friends,
to everything we all have,

42:54.071 --> 42:57.459
and to all of us being together
for this holiday. Happy holidays.

42:57.585 --> 43:00.137
- Happy holidays!
- Merry Christmas.

43:02.355 --> 43:03.527
Hey.

43:10.055 --> 43:13.653
So did the Santa ghost cross over?

43:13.779 --> 43:15.370
I don't think so.

43:15.495 --> 43:17.337
Really? Why not?

43:22.274 --> 43:24.407
Because I think
he really likes what he does.

43:24.533 --> 43:27.087
I want skates!
I want a ball!

43:34.158 --> 43:36.669
- Hey, you guys, come on!
Oh, my God!
