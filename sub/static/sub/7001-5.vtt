01:12.509 --> 01:16.259
Welcome to Tool Time. the show that
teaches you how to improve your home.

01:16.350 --> 01:17.779
- Morning, Al.
- Morning, Tim.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.700
Honey, I am freezing cold.
Feel my hands.

01:22.029 --> 01:26.299
I'll warm them. Slip them
in the Taylor Toast-O-Matic oven.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.219
- Those babies are colder than a witch's…
- Tim.

01:29.309 --> 01:32.499
- You're watching this again?
- This'll become a classic.

01:32.590 --> 01:37.180
- Is this the third time you've watched it?
- It's got it all: action, drama, latex paint.

01:37.269 --> 01:41.940
- God. I look good in that vest, don't I?
- No, really, honey. I'm so cold.

01:42.029 --> 01:46.459
Would you go and check the furnace?
I think the pilot light must be out.

01:46.549 --> 01:48.900
You're saying lighting a pilot's
a man's job?

01:48.989 --> 01:51.900
No. I'm saying it's your job.

01:52.950 --> 01:56.860
You're afraid to go down into
that deep, dark basement, aren't you?

01:56.950 --> 02:01.739
No. I'm not afraid. I just don't like it
when the furnace goes whoosh!

02:01.830 --> 02:06.019
- I'll light the pilot light if I get a big kiss.
- Do I have to?

02:06.110 --> 02:09.139
- You have to.
- OK, but only if I really have to.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.818
Oh, gross!

02:10.910 --> 02:13.660
It's not even dark yet.

02:13.749 --> 02:16.130
Ignore them.
Maybe they'll go away.

02:16.229 --> 02:21.459
Honey, you have to do the furnace now
because Mark's Scout troop is coming.

02:21.549 --> 02:24.499
and I don't want a house
full of little frozen Cub-sicles.

02:24.590 --> 02:26.660
Right away.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.819
Dad, check this out.
I can tell your future with these cards.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.900
A kid at school showed me how.

02:33.989 --> 02:37.380
I got the three of diamonds.
That means I'm gonna be rich.

02:37.469 --> 02:40.739
- The fourth card from the top is your card.
- Deal it, buddy.

02:40.830 --> 02:42.819
One, two, three…

02:45.029 --> 02:47.979
Ace of spadoes.
Read it and weep.

02:48.069 --> 02:49.459
What?

02:49.549 --> 02:52.009
It's the death card. Dad.

02:53.069 --> 02:56.219
Yeah, right. Let me deal those.
Cut 'em like a man.

03:00.309 --> 03:02.140
- OK.
- I can see it now:

03:02.229 --> 03:05.620
cars, cash, big homes, boats…

03:05.709 --> 03:08.170
Death.

03:08.269 --> 03:09.940
Double death.

03:10.029 --> 03:13.180
- How long do I have?
- Long enough to light the furnace.

03:13.269 --> 03:16.219
She's right. We got work to do.
Down to the basement.

03:16.309 --> 03:21.100
because one day, boys.
you will have a cold woman of your own.

03:21.190 --> 03:24.969
and you have to learn
how to light her furnace.

03:25.069 --> 03:27.580
Down to the basement.
Come on, guys.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.779
OK, guys.

03:30.709 --> 03:35.620
Come on down to the climate control centre
of our house. Watch what you're doing.

03:45.789 --> 03:51.499
I want you guys to meet a friend of mine.
the Binford Vulcan-O-Master 5.OOO.

03:52.749 --> 03:56.739
A quantum leap ahead of the 4.000 model
which we replaced this year.

03:56.830 --> 04:00.979
this is 1 50.000 BTU.

04:01.069 --> 04:04.380
- What's a BTU?
- Technical term.

04:07.910 --> 04:10.100
Yeah, but what's it stand for?

04:10.190 --> 04:12.979
U is because it's a unit.

04:14.309 --> 04:18.339
B is because it's
a big, beautiful Binford. That's B.

04:18.430 --> 04:22.900
T is heat. Big Heat Unit.
That's what this is.

04:24.670 --> 04:27.420
- Dad, heat starts with H.
- Give me that flashlight.

04:27.509 --> 04:29.739
Dad! Heat starts with H.

04:29.830 --> 04:32.700
Heat ends with T. Heat.

04:32.789 --> 04:34.779
Heat, heat.

04:35.950 --> 04:38.299
Working on a furnace
is a delicate operation.

04:38.390 --> 04:40.499
almost like working on a time bomb.

04:40.590 --> 04:44.900
That's how he's gonna die.
He's gonna blow himself up.

04:46.229 --> 04:52.779
That's not how I'm gonna die because your
dad is gonna practice furnace safety tips.

04:52.870 --> 04:57.259
The access panel here says.
''Press button, hold 1 5 seconds, and…''

04:57.350 --> 05:03.340
Open your mouth, or the shock waves
from the blast will make your head explode.

05:10.709 --> 05:12.420
1 3…

05:12.509 --> 05:14.779
14…

05:14.870 --> 05:16.620
1 5.

05:16.709 --> 05:19.459
No explosion, no death. Why? Why?

05:19.549 --> 05:21.700
Because your dad
laughs in the face of fear.

05:25.309 --> 05:29.900
Excuse me, fellas. Jill, set it back to ''auto''
and the heat is now working, hon.

05:38.590 --> 05:40.779
What was that?

05:41.870 --> 05:43.940
Be very quiet.

05:44.390 --> 05:46.580
What is it?

05:48.469 --> 05:51.860
I think it's over there behind the boxes.

05:53.789 --> 05:58.140
- Boy. I hope it's not that. It couldn't be.
- What?

05:58.229 --> 06:02.219
Yesterday, at the zoo…
I read that a panther escaped.

06:02.309 --> 06:05.580
- Yeah, right. Dad.
- I'm not kidding.

06:06.150 --> 06:10.499
Don't make any sudden moves.
Just head toward the stairs.

06:10.590 --> 06:13.499
It could be anywhere.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.890
It could be…

06:23.390 --> 06:25.950
It's just a mouse or something, probably.

06:26.029 --> 06:28.860
What if it's not a mouse?
It could be a snake.

06:30.229 --> 06:32.259
There's nothing funny about snakes.

06:32.350 --> 06:37.700
There's nothing funny
about slimy reptiles. Nothing.

06:37.789 --> 06:39.940
Hey, maybe it's a big, huge python.

06:40.029 --> 06:42.059
Enough, enough.

06:42.150 --> 06:44.499
It's a mouse. A mouse.

06:44.590 --> 06:48.620
Of course, it could be a huge one
that likes to eat little kids like you.

06:54.989 --> 06:57.289
Do I have to put in speed bumps?

06:57.390 --> 06:59.950
- Mom?
- Yeah?

07:00.029 --> 07:01.420
What are we gonna make?

07:01.509 --> 07:08.100
I am going to have the whole Scout troop
make their own paper-bag masks.

07:11.150 --> 07:14.819
Is that all? Billy's mom
helped us make a real tepee.

07:14.910 --> 07:20.580
- She did?
- And she made beef jerky from raw meat.

07:21.749 --> 07:25.340
Billy's mom is a Stepford wife.

07:25.430 --> 07:28.459
You're getting pizza
and paper-bag masks.

07:30.390 --> 07:34.340
Well. I guess I better put on my uniform.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.850
Honey, mission accomplished.

07:40.950 --> 07:44.019
furnace is lit, operational.

07:44.110 --> 07:48.580
- That, however, is the good news.
- What's the bad news?

07:48.670 --> 07:51.180
Well. I can't tell you.
You'll probably go crazy.

07:51.269 --> 07:53.340
Oh, please. I never go crazy.

07:53.910 --> 07:56.289
I found something furry
that rhymes with ''house''.

07:56.390 --> 07:57.979
Oh, God.

07:58.069 --> 08:01.259
There's a famous one named Mickey.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.499
It's a mouse.

08:04.590 --> 08:10.380
God. A mouse with beady little eyes
and toe-jammy little nails.

08:11.630 --> 08:14.190
Jill, it's just a little innocent thing.

08:14.269 --> 08:18.700
Tim, they are dirty. They carry disease.
They eat garbage.

08:18.789 --> 08:22.569
So do the boys.
You're not afraid of them.

08:23.509 --> 08:25.100
Yes. I am.

08:28.430 --> 08:31.819
- You hear that?
- Tim, don't!

08:32.989 --> 08:35.700
I thought I heard toe-jammy toenails…

08:35.789 --> 08:37.659
Stop it. Stop it!

08:37.749 --> 08:40.900
They're so little.
they run anywhere, up people's backs.

08:41.308 --> 08:43.610
Quit i @

08:44.309 --> 08:47.620
It's in the basement.
Get oﬀ the chair, please.

08:47.709 --> 08:51.380
- Would you please call an exterminator?
- Exterminator?

08:51.469 --> 08:54.700
- Yeah.
- Pest control is my domain.

08:54.789 --> 08:58.979
Termites fear me.
mice whisper my name.

08:59.069 --> 09:01.900
''Hey, forget the cheese.
Come back to the hole. It's Tim.''

09:01.989 --> 09:05.860
''Come on, come on.
He'll kill you. He'll kill you.''

09:06.430 --> 09:09.739
- I'll go see if Wilson has any traps.
- No. Don't kill it.

09:09.830 --> 09:14.819
from filthy little vermin to your fuzzy
little friend. Where did that start?

09:14.910 --> 09:18.420
Just because I don't like it
doesn't mean I want to see it dead.

09:18.509 --> 09:23.580
Otherwise I'd have set traps
for your mother years ago.

09:24.309 --> 09:27.019
Trap wouldn't stop her.

09:28.390 --> 09:31.259
She'd just chew her leg oﬀ.

09:35.110 --> 09:37.670
- Wilson!
- Hi-ho, neighbor.

09:37.749 --> 09:40.580
Do you have any of
those humane traps for mice?

09:40.670 --> 09:45.789
- Since when did you become a trapper?
- I think I heard a mouse in my basement.

09:45.870 --> 09:48.860
Jill got real freaked out.
Can you believe that?

09:48.950 --> 09:51.219
Well, fear is perfectly natural.

09:51.309 --> 09:53.819
Everybody's afraid of something.

09:53.910 --> 09:56.499
What about you. Wilson?
What are you afraid of?

09:56.590 --> 10:00.900
I do have one underlying fear. Tim.

10:01.709 --> 10:07.340
I'm afraid that reality as we know it
is someone else's dream, and…

10:07.430 --> 10:11.420
when the dreamer awakes.
I'll no longer exist.

10:17.229 --> 10:21.180
Wilson. I wouldn't share that
with too many people.

10:21.269 --> 10:23.620
- Back to the trap.
- Sure, good buddy.

10:23.709 --> 10:27.180
- You said you heard noises in the kitchen?
- No, in the basement.

10:27.269 --> 10:29.299
- In the basement?
- Yeah.

10:29.390 --> 10:35.020
- You've been hearing scratching noises?
- No, kind of more of a rustling.

10:35.109 --> 10:37.180
- Rustling?
- Yeah.

10:39.790 --> 10:41.980
Tim, my boy. I don't think
you have a problem with mice.

10:42.069 --> 10:44.939
- Great.
- It sounds like you might have a snake.

10:45.029 --> 10:47.100
Oh, God!

10:47.189 --> 10:50.419
- You're scared of snakes. Tim?
- Ugh, man.

10:50.509 --> 10:52.660
Snakes are supposed to live in the woods.

10:52.750 --> 10:57.060
This whole area used to be woods.
but as man has taken over his habitat.

10:57.149 --> 10:59.259
they've become suburban snakes.

11:00.589 --> 11:04.899
Suburban snakes? They work here.
commute back to the woods?

11:06.310 --> 11:09.060
No, they could be right here
living in your own backyard.

11:09.149 --> 11:11.859
or somebody in the neighborhood
could be breeding snakes.

11:11.950 --> 11:14.819
All you need is a cardboard box
and a light bulb.

11:14.910 --> 11:17.290
What kind of sicko
would breed snakes?

11:17.390 --> 11:21.500
Well. Tim, snakes are clean.
low-maintenance pets.

11:21.589 --> 11:24.620
Plus, they have a very firm.
nutty-tasting flesh.

11:29.029 --> 11:31.939
So, what's the deal?
Are you gonna set some traps?

11:32.029 --> 11:36.739
Wilson doesn't think we need one.
I'm calling the exterminator.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.419
- Why?
- He doesn't think we have mice.

11:40.509 --> 11:42.779
Oh, no. It's a rat.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.859
Worse.., snake.

11:44.950 --> 11:46.899
- Snake?
- Where?

11:47.669 --> 11:50.859
Oh, no! Oh. God, not a snake.
That's a…

11:50.950 --> 11:55.660
Wait a minute. Didn't you
tell me that you saw a mouse?

11:55.750 --> 11:59.859
- I didn't see it in the visual sense.
- You jerk. You lied to me.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.859
- I didn't lie. I was kidding.
- Kidding?

12:02.950 --> 12:06.779
- Mom. Dad, come look what I found.
- Just a second. Randy. Kidding?

12:06.870 --> 12:10.180
You were just torturing me
with all those little mouse sounds.

12:10.270 --> 12:12.419
Come on, what's the big deal?

12:12.509 --> 12:15.859
- Everybody likes to be scared. It's fun.
- Fun?

12:15.950 --> 12:18.859
- Dad.
- What is it? God. Look.

12:18.950 --> 12:21.859
- Holy…!
- I found a snakeskin.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.070
This is fun. This is fun.

12:29.559 --> 12:33.509
Dad, did you know the deadliest snake
in the world is a carpet viper?

12:33.600 --> 12:36.429
It has enough poison to kill ten men.

12:36.519 --> 12:39.269
Brad, has that exterminator
found anything down there?

12:39.360 --> 12:40.909
Not yet.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.110
Damn. Honey, what's taking him so long?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.190
Tim, we have a yard full of children.

12:45.279 --> 12:47.840
We're supposed to be setting
an example. You have to calm down.

12:47.919 --> 12:50.220
- Have a cookie.
- Hot cookie! Hot cookie!

12:50.320 --> 12:51.950
Sorry. Sorry.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.950
Dad, the exterminator
wants to borrow a screwdriver.

12:55.039 --> 12:56.909
You know where they are.
Get it yourself.

12:57.000 --> 13:01.590
No. You always say not to touch
your tools. You better get him one.

13:01.679 --> 13:04.389
What's he want - standard.
Davis. Phillips, flat head, what?

13:04.480 --> 13:07.039
- flat head.
- All right…

13:15.919 --> 13:17.190
- find the snake?
- Sorry.

13:17.279 --> 13:19.659
I did my best, but I didn't find a thing.

13:19.759 --> 13:22.590
- Nothing cool ever happens here.
- Randy…

13:22.679 --> 13:24.980
You're telling me
there's not a snake in this house?

13:25.080 --> 13:27.950
It probably moseyed on back outside.

13:28.039 --> 13:30.230
That happens nine times out of ten.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.990
Nine times out of ten?

13:34.559 --> 13:37.019
What happens the other time?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.950
I tell you, it's funny. Those snakes…

13:40.039 --> 13:42.549
They pop right up
out of the strangest places.

13:42.639 --> 13:45.019
Boy. I could write a book. Golly.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.590
I've seen them curl up inside of teapots.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.750
There was one time -
popped right up out of the toilet.

13:58.639 --> 14:03.070
Like I said, that's rare. Besides.
you don't have anything to worry about.

14:03.159 --> 14:06.269
Judging from that skin
your boy found, it's not poisonous.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.509
Well. I'll see you folks.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.029
Wait. Wouldn't you like to stay
and have a cup of coﬀee?

14:12.120 --> 14:13.950
Sorry. I've got lots of appointments.

14:14.039 --> 14:15.789
- Toodle-oo.
- Bye.

14:15.879 --> 14:18.950
Mom. Jimmy Wagner wants to go home.

14:19.039 --> 14:21.419
- Why?
- He got the death card.

14:21.519 --> 14:24.190
- Brad.
- Randy.

14:24.279 --> 14:26.230
Come on, don't be a weenie.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.470
Everybody's got to die sometime.

14:28.559 --> 14:32.230
Hey, guys, get away from him.
Come on, go back in the house.

14:33.679 --> 14:35.710
- You all right?
- I don't wanna die.

14:35.799 --> 14:38.909
Come here.
You're not gonna die.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.590
- But I got the death card.
- forget the death card.

14:41.679 --> 14:45.029
I got mo death cards today and I didn't die.
They were teasing you.

14:45.120 --> 14:49.269
- But I'm scared.
- Oh, boy. Come here.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.659
Everybody's scared of something.

14:51.759 --> 14:54.990
- Are you ever afraid?
- My dad's never afraid.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.950
He's the bravest man in the whole world.

14:58.039 --> 15:01.820
You guys, all of you.
even brave guys get afraid.

15:01.919 --> 15:04.350
You know what a brave man does
when he's afraid?

15:04.440 --> 15:06.110
What?

15:06.200 --> 15:09.669
He… He… He scares away fear.

15:10.720 --> 15:14.070
Jimmy, you gotta be scarier than fear itself.
That's what you gotta do.

15:14.159 --> 15:17.309
- How do you do that?
- Well. look at me.

15:17.399 --> 15:19.909
Get a real ugly face on.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.230
Pretty ugly, huh?

15:22.320 --> 15:25.110
You look at fear and you go…
You grunt loud.

15:27.159 --> 15:29.789
Want to try that?

15:29.879 --> 15:32.070
That would work if you had a little fear.

15:32.159 --> 15:34.389
It's a big fear.
You gotta get a deep-down, manly grunt.

15:34.480 --> 15:37.710
Mark, show him what I'm talking about.

15:37.799 --> 15:40.509
See how scary that guy looks?
Now you guys try.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.629
Very good and very ugly.

15:45.720 --> 15:48.309
All right, try. Give me a good one.

15:48.399 --> 15:50.779
I need a real good mo in a row.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.629
All right, three in a row. Let's do it.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.470
Come on, guys.

15:57.559 --> 16:00.710
There's no fear here.
Get out of here, fear.

16:02.799 --> 16:05.149
Dad.

16:05.240 --> 16:06.950
Mom wants you to order pizza.

16:07.039 --> 16:09.909
Pizza!

16:10.000 --> 16:13.149
You guys stay out here and practice
grunting, and I'll get the pizza.

16:15.279 --> 16:17.190
Number for the pizza place
is by the phone.

16:17.279 --> 16:20.269
Thanks. Jill.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.950
Hi. How many pizzas do we need?

16:26.039 --> 16:28.909
four large, but get diﬀerent toppings.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.950
All right. I need four larges
with mo meat… Hold on a minute.

16:33.039 --> 16:35.340
Is anybody allergic to anything out there?

16:35.440 --> 16:38.429
- Jimmy's allergic to everything.
- Am not.

16:38.519 --> 16:44.269
All right. Apparently, we need a big cheese
pizza with decongestant all over it.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.830
I'm kidding around, fella.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.590
All right. Two cheese.
one with pepperoni and sausage on…

16:51.159 --> 16:54.860
There's a snake!
There is a snake in my house. Right there.

16:54.960 --> 16:57.389
- There is a snake.
- OK. Everybody, quiet down.

16:57.480 --> 17:02.269
Tim, hang up the phone.
I'll call the exterminator on the other phone.

17:06.358 --> 17:10.710
- Why don't you get the snake out. Dad?
- Why don't you shut up. Randy?

17:14.640 --> 17:19.190
Dad, stick your finger in the light.
When the snake bites it, pull him out.

17:21.039 --> 17:24.230
Can we talk?
Maybe you didn't hear Dad the first time.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.670
Shut up.

17:26.759 --> 17:30.349
OK. I've got the exterminator.
but he says he can't come for an hour.

17:30.440 --> 17:32.950
An hour?
Where's he gonna crawl in an hour?

17:33.039 --> 17:38.190
OK. He says you should look in the light
fixture and see if the snake is still there.

17:38.279 --> 17:40.269
- Can I talk to him for a minute?
- Yeah.

17:42.519 --> 17:46.549
You're right. He says look in the light
fixture and see if he's still there.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.269
Me? Oh, no, no, no.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.269
- I think you should do it.
- I'm so busy right now.

17:51.359 --> 17:53.589
Tim, get over there
and look in that light fixture.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.789
I don't want to.

17:55.880 --> 18:00.190
- Go ahead. Mr Taylor.
- You're not afraid, are you. Mr Taylor?

18:00.279 --> 18:02.269
My dad's not afraid of anything.

18:02.359 --> 18:04.950
Show 'em. Dad.
Show 'em you're not scared. Dad.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.869
Let's get ourselves a snake!

18:15.960 --> 18:20.029
Cub Scouts, outside.
I'm sorry. You can watch through the glass.

18:20.119 --> 18:22.190
Thanks. Yes, thank you, thank you.

18:22.279 --> 18:25.950
Brad. I need a pillowcase
out of your bedroom. Hurry up.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.910
OK. What did he say?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.950
He says reach in that little tiny opening.

18:31.039 --> 18:34.230
get that little tiny snake
by the back of his little tiny neck.

18:34.319 --> 18:38.509
pull him out of that little tiny hole.
and put him gently in a pillowcase.

18:38.599 --> 18:41.430
- You're gonna do that?
- That's his plan.

18:41.519 --> 18:43.509
My plan…

18:45.559 --> 18:50.950
I'm gonna rip that light fixture oﬀ that wall.
shove that into a pillowcase.

18:51.039 --> 18:52.589
- Here you go. Dad.
- Brad. Brad.

18:52.680 --> 18:56.829
Stand there under the light
and I'll jump that snake in there.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.430
- No way.
- What do you mean. ''no way''?

19:00.519 --> 19:02.980
- Come on. Randy, help me out.
- forget it.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.309
OK. I'll do it.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.950
- Are you happy, your mom's doing it?
- It's fine by us.

19:13.039 --> 19:15.029
Thanks, guys.

19:21.039 --> 19:23.109
- Ready?
- Ready.

19:24.359 --> 19:26.150
Calm?

19:26.240 --> 19:28.269
No. I can't.

19:44.759 --> 19:47.220
Jill, Jill, Jill.

19:49.039 --> 19:50.990
t it, i got it!@

19:53.519 --> 19:55.549
Yes!

20:02.359 --> 20:06.630
There it is, boys.
Plan your work, work your plan.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.710
The key to success.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.349
- Dad?
- Yeah?

20:16.440 --> 20:18.589
There's a snake behind you.

20:18.839 --> 20:20.990
I bet there is!

20:26.039 --> 20:29.509
Dad, he's serious.
It's right behind you.

20:29.599 --> 20:32.509
Does it have
the card of death in its mouth?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.779
You know, guys.
I fell for that trick this morning.

20:37.880 --> 20:39.869
Toolbox - remember that?

20:39.960 --> 20:42.190
You can take a practical joke too far.

20:42.279 --> 20:45.390
Dad, we're not joking.
It's moving towards you.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.910
Why don't I open my shirt
and let him crawl right in?

20:52.279 --> 20:54.390
The snake wasn't in the bag.

20:56.039 --> 20:58.069
The snake is in my shirt.

21:12.079 --> 21:14.710
- Here you go, hon.
- Hey, thanks.

21:14.799 --> 21:17.829
- How are you feeling?
- Stupid.

21:22.279 --> 21:24.950
I felt like a jerk in front of
those Cub Scouts today.

21:25.039 --> 21:29.589
They had a great time, and they
learned some colorful new vocabulary.

21:32.119 --> 21:34.869
Here. Dad.
I made this for you.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.630
- What is it?
- It's a snake badge for bravery.

21:38.720 --> 21:41.950
Hey, that's very impressive.

21:42.039 --> 21:44.470
Would you wear it on your TV show?

21:44.559 --> 21:46.549
You bet I would.

21:47.279 --> 21:49.430
You're a good kid.

21:49.519 --> 21:52.109
- Good night. Dad.
- Good night.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.990
- Good night. Mommy.
- Good night, sweetie.

21:55.079 --> 21:57.750
Good night. Mommy.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.509
My youngest son gave me
a snake badge for bravery.

22:02.599 --> 22:05.789
Well, you did get rid of that snake.

22:05.880 --> 22:09.950
I couldn't have done it without you.
I think it's yours.

22:10.039 --> 22:12.549
Well, we'll share it.

22:12.640 --> 22:16.309
I think we deserve a little pampering.

22:17.680 --> 22:21.750
How would you like
to have a nice, hot bath with bubbles?

22:21.839 --> 22:24.349
I'd like that. Bubbles.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.470
Five…
No, we've already seen his hand.

23:06.039 --> 23:07.950
And five…

23:08.039 --> 23:10.470
five, four…
