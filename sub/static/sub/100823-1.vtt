You know what takes up so
much space and luggage? Jackets.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.888
- I hate it.
- Dave, can you come here a minute?

00:28.921 --> 00:31.323
What's up? You okay?

00:38.898 --> 00:41.834
I knew it! I knew it!
I knew it when we were doing it.

00:43.602 --> 00:46.338
- I love you.
- Oh, my God. I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

00:46.371 --> 00:48.975
It was the night after Alex and
Jane's place, by the way. I called it.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.509
- It was New Year's Eve.
- Well, come on.

00:50.542 --> 00:51.443
Yeah.

00:58.583 --> 01:00.720
So you think we should
wait and tell people this time?

01:00.753 --> 01:05.557
Oh, we wait. Lesson learned
on that one, right?

01:05.590 --> 01:07.627
Someone keeps calling me. Shut up.

01:07.660 --> 01:11.263
No one's gonna take our moment,
no matter what.

01:13.498 --> 01:16.501
God, who the fuck is calling me right now.

01:19.538 --> 01:22.274
- It's my fucking mom.
- Don't answer it. Don't...

01:22.307 --> 01:25.277
- I know, I... I haven't been...
- Don't let her do this to you.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.813
Don't let her do this to us.

01:30.415 --> 01:33.251
- Do I go?
- No, you should definitely...

01:33.285 --> 01:36.823
- Goddammit, she keeps calling like six times.
- Oh, God.

01:36.856 --> 01:38.958
- I'm just gonna fucking take it.
- I see.

01:39.624 --> 01:40.559
Hello.

01:44.630 --> 01:45.631
You what?

01:47.532 --> 01:50.268
Okay, okay. Can you just
give me a minute and I'm gonna

01:50.302 --> 01:52.638
talk to Jude,
I'll talk to the girls and then

01:53.873 --> 01:57.910
I'm gonna call you back, okay?
Okay. Bye.

02:03.548 --> 02:05.752
- No.
- She said that she is dying.

02:05.785 --> 02:08.386
Oh, come on. You do not...

02:09.822 --> 02:12.557
need to unfuck every situation.
You have three siblings.

02:13.391 --> 02:16.428
Yeah,
but if she is then, like...

02:17.496 --> 02:22.567
Someone doesn't have to be
my wife and my child.

02:24.704 --> 02:26.939
- Love you.
- I love you. I gotta go.

02:26.973 --> 02:28.908
- Okay. Go, go. Okay.
- I have to leave.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.676
Are you gonna take care
of yourself? I'm annoying.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.611
- I'll take care.
- Do what you need to do

02:32.645 --> 02:35.014
- and I gotta find my jacket.
- Okay. Okay.

02:41.687 --> 02:42.655
Fuck.

02:47.592 --> 02:51.396
Jude. Jude.

02:52.531 --> 02:55.034
- What were you doing outside?
- Nothing.

02:55.067 --> 02:58.370
Doesn't your ankle bracelet
alarm go off when you go outside?

02:58.403 --> 02:59.772
- I was in the driveway.
- Who is that?

02:59.806 --> 03:01.473
A friend.

03:01.506 --> 03:02.942
From where?

03:05.377 --> 03:06.411
Grindr.

03:08.781 --> 03:11.583
Mom says that she has cancer.

03:12.652 --> 03:14.754
- And you believed her?
- That's exactly what I'm saying.

03:14.787 --> 03:17.522
Listen, Jude,
could you just make sure

03:17.556 --> 03:19.659
this does not roll
onto her shoulders again?

03:20.425 --> 03:23.361
Are you available
to maybe go visit her?

03:23.963 --> 03:26.032
<i>Low battery, recharge unit.</i>

03:30.102 --> 03:32.104

I'm still
shocked that you're here.

05:39.265 --> 05:41.599
What's going on?
What'd the doctor say it was?

05:46.604 --> 05:49.842
Mom, you called your kids and you told
them that you were dying of cancer

05:49.875 --> 05:52.610
- but you didn't actually go to the doctor.
- No,

05:52.645 --> 05:54.579
I do not go
to the doctor, you know me,

05:54.612 --> 05:57.149
- and that is not a thing that happens.
- Mom,

05:57.183 --> 06:01.053
the thing is is that you don't actually
know if you're dying of cancer or not.

06:01.087 --> 06:04.290
- So...
- Oh, like... like... like I'm lying?

06:04.323 --> 06:08.728
It could be pneumonia and then we
could just give you antibiotics, or...

06:08.761 --> 06:11.964
Or you could rattle off
names of all kinds of diseases

06:11.998 --> 06:14.566
from here to next week.
You could do that.

06:15.768 --> 06:18.204
- What does that even mean?
- It's a waste of time.

06:18.237 --> 06:21.539
You could have died in a... in
a plane crash on the way here.

06:21.573 --> 06:25.244
We don't know what... we don't know. But
something's gonna get every last one of us.

06:26.812 --> 06:32.018
Okay? And I... I got the drugs.
I got that taken care of.

06:35.921 --> 06:37.589
You know that's right.

06:40.159 --> 06:41.727
You know that's right.

06:42.228 --> 06:45.131

to the hospital right now?

<i>I... I just worry
about you.</i>

07:06.652 --> 07:08.821
<i>You promised you're gonna
take care of yourself.</i>

07:08.854 --> 07:11.891

Hello.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.976
- Hi, Dr. Watson.
- You got to see this mushroom.

07:31.010 --> 07:34.647
Yeah.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.182
How long do you think?

07:48.427 --> 07:50.229
Hello, can you hear me?

07:51.664 --> 07:53.265
<i>Hello. Hi.</i>

07:53.299 --> 07:55.301
- Hi.
- <i>Hey.</i>

07:55.334 --> 07:57.269
Hi, Julia.

07:57.303 --> 08:01.807
<i>So amazing. Oh, my God.
We're all on this thing.</i>

08:02.341 --> 08:05.144
Wow, I haven't seen you
in so long.

08:05.177 --> 08:07.646
<i>This is so amazing.
You guys do this all the time?</i>

08:08.781 --> 08:12.384
- No. No, we definitely don't.
- <i>Yeah. I do.</i>

08:13.719 --> 08:16.889
- <i>Where are you right now?</i>
- I'm at Mom's house.

08:16.922 --> 08:21.060
- <i>Hey, Sadie, you're at Mom's house right now?</i>
- Mm-Hm.

08:22.061 --> 08:24.296
<i>Yeah, where is she?
Can we say hi to her?</i>

08:25.731 --> 08:28.801
She's asleep. Um...

08:30.236 --> 08:36.174
I wanted to call you guys, I don't want to,
like, do any like grapevine calling but, um,

08:36.207 --> 08:41.046
I talked to the doctor.
She has lung cancer. It's stage four.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.082
<i>Wait, I can't...
I cannot hear. I can't hear anything</i>

08:44.116 --> 08:50.189
<i>with... hey, Jude, can you... I can't...
their munching is a lot. I can't hear...</i>

08:50.222 --> 08:53.926
Can you... Jude, can you just...
Jude, get off your fucking phone, dude.

08:54.393 --> 08:58.364
What the fuck. You guys...
you guys just shut the fuck up and listen.

08:58.397 --> 09:01.967
Mom has stage four lung cancer.
She's gonna die.

09:02.001 --> 09:05.704
- <i>You need to calm. I can't hear you.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

09:05.738 --> 09:08.374
Mom has stage... oh, my God.

09:09.241 --> 09:12.378
- <i>Please, I... just please let Sadie...</i>
- You guys,

09:12.411 --> 09:15.114
Mom has stage four lung cancer
and she's gonna die.

09:16.248 --> 09:19.985
So this is the time where you
stop making it all about you.

09:20.019 --> 09:22.855
She's gonna be dead.
She's not gonna remember.

09:22.888 --> 09:25.724
And you're gonna have to live with
whatever the fuck you decide to do.

09:25.758 --> 09:27.359
So you can come here
and do the right thing

09:27.393 --> 09:29.995
and come to Texas
or you can just fucking continue

09:30.029 --> 09:31.764
being obsessed with yourselves.

09:34.833 --> 09:37.102
<i>That's a really shitty way
to tell us, Sadie.</i>

09:38.804 --> 09:40.439
<i>Way to go.
Yeah, really good work there.</i>

09:45.277 --> 09:47.246
- Well...
- <i>I'm gonna go.</i>

09:48.914 --> 09:52.017
<i>No, no, no, no, Jude, can you
stay here for just a minute?</i>

09:52.851 --> 09:55.888
- <i>I'll see you guys later.</i>
- <i>Hey, Jude, can you stay</i>

09:55.921 --> 09:57.890
- <i>for just a...</i>
- <i>Wait.</i>

10:00.359 --> 10:04.129
<i>Alright, I'm gonna go, too.
I love you, guys. Bye.</i>

10:13.472 --> 10:15.407
<i>I don't know how
to hang up on this.</i>

10:15.441 --> 10:18.410
<i>I don't know how to stop
the thing from going.</i>

10:19.178 --> 10:21.113
- Can you come?
- <i>Huh?</i>

10:23.048 --> 10:25.918
<i>I'm saying everyone's hanging up
and... and you guys spent</i>

10:25.951 --> 10:28.954
<i>20 minutes trying to get me
on this Google,</i>

10:28.988 --> 10:31.857
<i>this Hangout thing,
and now I don't know how to...</i>

10:31.890 --> 10:34.026
<i>I don't even know
how to press no.</i>

10:34.059 --> 10:37.062
You just click the red button.
Just move your...

10:37.096 --> 10:39.932
move your mouse down
and then there's a red circle,

10:39.965 --> 10:41.166
just wiggle it
over the red circle.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.168
<i>What red button?</i>

10:43.202 --> 10:45.137
There's a...
just wiggle your mouse.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.172
Do you know what...
like, find the arrow

10:47.206 --> 10:49.074
and then push the red button.

<i>It's Paul's laptop.
I don't even understand.</i>

10:51.143 --> 10:53.279
<i>I mean this took
so long to get me...</i>

11:02.087 --> 11:06.358
<i>Yeah, it's real,
it's happening.</i>

11:07.926 --> 11:10.062
<i>And looks like I'm gonna be
here a while.</i>

11:10.095 --> 11:12.298
<i>None of my siblings are coming.</i>

11:12.331 --> 11:14.933
<i>Don't internalize it,
all right?</i>

11:14.967 --> 11:16.302
<i>Don't let it go to your...</i>

11:17.169 --> 11:18.871
<i>Sadie, what I think
I'm trying to say</i>

11:18.904 --> 11:22.408
<i>is I love you and I am worried.</i>

11:22.441 --> 11:25.210
<i>I know you're trying
to help but you're not.</i>

11:25.244 --> 11:28.147
<i>So can we just change
the subject?</i>

11:28.180 --> 11:30.616
<i>She saw us all the band photos</i>

11:30.650 --> 11:33.118
<i>from the '70s when she
was still out on tour.</i>

11:34.019 --> 11:36.822
<i>You're a wonderful
daughter, whatever she says.</i>

11:39.291 --> 11:41.994
You know you're tired
and I am so tired.

11:43.162 --> 11:45.531
We never know this might be
your last night.

11:45.564 --> 11:47.499
Can we take a selfie
before you go to sleep?

11:48.367 --> 11:50.569
Gross. Yes.

11:50.602 --> 11:53.005
- Without your tube?
- Yes. Yes.

11:53.038 --> 11:54.641
Am I gonna kill you if
I take it out of your face?

11:54.674 --> 11:56.375
- Please.
- I'll put it right back down.

11:58.143 --> 11:59.945
- Does that feel okay?
- It feels great.

11:59.978 --> 12:04.983
Okay. We need
something to show the kids.

12:05.017 --> 12:07.386
- Is this really happening?
- Yeah, we are doing it.

12:07.419 --> 12:10.089
This is what's happened
to photography.

12:11.290 --> 12:15.662
Yeah, I am a professional, so I
do actually know what I'm doing.

12:15.695 --> 12:18.665
I may not have taken any famous
record covers, yet, like you,

12:18.698 --> 12:21.967
- but I do do it for a living.
- That's beautiful, honey.

12:23.302 --> 12:26.238
I actually canceled
a shoot to come to you.

12:26.271 --> 12:29.608
- So you'll lose the money?
- A lot of money.

12:29.642 --> 12:31.477
Now I feel guilty.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.414
I remember like...

12:36.415 --> 12:40.352
putting a camera
in your hands one time.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.390
I remember that.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.559
And I remember how excited
you were.

12:49.328 --> 12:52.030
Yeah, that makes sense
that you're doing this.

12:52.064 --> 12:54.701
Yeah, and I would like get
the cats and dress them up

12:54.734 --> 12:58.537
in Lucy's baby clothes.
It was a big deal.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.906
- Yeah, it is a big deal.
- I'm a big deal now.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.042
I mean not as big
a deal as you but...

13:04.076 --> 13:05.577
So what are you shooting?

13:05.611 --> 13:07.246
Weddings mostly.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.916
Well, you know,
got to start somewhere.

13:11.517 --> 13:13.986
- They're cool.
- They're cool weddings?

13:14.019 --> 13:16.488
Yeah, I... all my weddings
look like band albums.

13:16.522 --> 13:19.124
I mean I was published like
in the New York Times

13:19.158 --> 13:21.960
and had a lot of blog,
you know, coverage this year.

13:21.994 --> 13:23.262
It was actually
a really good year.

13:23.295 --> 13:24.496
I mean don't settle.

13:25.397 --> 13:26.331
Keep dreaming.

13:27.366 --> 13:29.435
You got your whole life
ahead of you, I mean...

13:30.068 --> 13:31.503
you know what I'm saying?

13:33.071 --> 13:34.072
Yeah.

13:35.541 --> 13:38.310
Paycheck is a paycheck,
don't get me wrong,

13:39.611 --> 13:41.046
but I'm just saying.

13:44.651 --> 13:47.519
You grew up in this house. Okay?

13:49.756 --> 13:52.324
Can I get a hit of your oxygen?
I'm feeling a little...

13:55.527 --> 13:57.029
Thanks, Mom.

13:57.062 --> 13:59.031
- I'm tired.
- Me, too.

14:14.513 --> 14:16.348
Maybe we've been
too hard on you.

14:37.770 --> 14:40.305
<i>Not now, Sadie,
Mom is not feeling good.</i>

14:43.609 --> 14:46.245
<i>Sadie, I know you can make
yourself a bowl of cereal,</i>

14:46.278 --> 14:48.046
<i>I've seen you do it.</i>

14:49.782 --> 14:52.150
<i>Mama is sleeping,
go ask your aunty.</i>

14:54.219 --> 14:56.789
<i>Go find Aunty Trashcan, alright?</i>

15:03.328 --> 15:05.330
<i>Go find Aunty Trashcan.</i>

15:21.547 --> 15:25.652
- I have a request.
- Okay.

15:25.685 --> 15:30.289
I'm just wondering if maybe I
could move this to my mom's house

15:30.322 --> 15:31.691
so that
I could take care of her.

15:32.558 --> 15:35.127
I mean that's definitely
within reason.

15:35.160 --> 15:38.230
I mean your mom's
not doing so hot

15:38.263 --> 15:41.233
and, yeah, like, I don't see why they
wouldn't approve something like that.

16:45.464 --> 16:48.500
And then like... look at that.

16:51.603 --> 16:53.740
- It's like an app.
- Eww, wait, what?

16:53.773 --> 16:55.775
It's an app
for plastic surgery.

16:55.808 --> 16:57.576
But what... is she
carrying that or did

16:57.609 --> 16:59.879
- she just get that done?
- No, that's like post-op.

16:59.912 --> 17:00.612
Sh.

17:02.447 --> 17:04.884
- Okay, chill the fuck out.
- Dude.

17:06.518 --> 17:09.588
- Can you not be talking about...
- She can't hear anything.

17:09.621 --> 17:13.358
Okay, okay,
you need to calm down.

17:13.392 --> 17:15.928
I haven't seen her
in a long time. I don't want you

17:15.962 --> 17:18.497
- to be talking about...
- Shut out.

17:21.366 --> 17:22.969
- I just don't want to be talking...
- Okay.

17:23.002 --> 17:25.503
You all be quiet,
I'm trying to sleep.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.578
Hi, Mom. Good morning.

17:34.781 --> 17:37.750
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

17:37.784 --> 17:39.284
- Hi.
- Look at Mommy.

17:39.317 --> 17:40.953
- Hi.
- Julia, where is she?

17:40.987 --> 17:43.488
How are you, Mom?

17:43.522 --> 17:48.527
What are you all doing here?
Chill me a little bit. Hi.

17:48.560 --> 17:50.462
- Hi.
- Hello, honey.

17:50.495 --> 17:51.631
Hi.

17:53.733 --> 17:56.334
Hi.

17:58.503 --> 18:00.572
- Oh, not you too.
- Hey, you too.

18:00.605 --> 18:03.475
Not you too, little sneaky
little thing over there.

18:03.508 --> 18:05.544
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

18:05.577 --> 18:08.346
You look so good.

18:08.380 --> 18:10.750
I would... you would never know.

18:10.783 --> 18:14.486
Boy, you hadn't
changed a bit.

18:14.519 --> 18:16.254
Alright.

18:16.288 --> 18:18.623
No. No. Y'all,
this is so funny

18:18.658 --> 18:20.392
that y'all
are all here right now 'cause

18:20.425 --> 18:24.797
it reminds me
so much of this one time...

18:24.831 --> 18:27.566
well,
one of many times, whatever...

18:28.400 --> 18:32.638
when Van Morrison was coming through
and we used to go to every concert,

18:32.672 --> 18:34.974
you know,
you all know that, and... anyway,

18:35.007 --> 18:37.542
- Van Morrison, I was backstage...
- Uncle Van.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.813
Yeah, he used to put me like
on his shoulders.

18:40.847 --> 18:43.482
- He was funny.
- It was the Grateful Dead.

18:43.515 --> 18:47.754
Yeah... I can't...
you know what, I think it could have been.

18:47.787 --> 18:49.956
- It could have been.
- That's what you told me.

18:49.989 --> 18:51.556
I was there.
It was Van Morrison.

18:51.590 --> 18:53.960
Anyway, it was a band...

18:53.993 --> 18:56.428
- Could have been either one.
- ...they came to her house

18:56.461 --> 18:58.563
and had some fun and I woke up

18:58.597 --> 19:01.734
and they were all there.
And that's what reminds me...

19:01.768 --> 19:03.936
that's what brings
me back to this moment.

19:14.680 --> 19:15.948
Nurse is here.

19:18.651 --> 19:20.585
I don't need a nurse.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.587
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

19:22.621 --> 19:23.923
- Good.
- Hi.

19:25.457 --> 19:29.095
- Hey, buddy. Hi Ms. Pride.
- Hi.

19:29.128 --> 19:33.699
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm... I'm good. I'm fine. I'm fine.

19:33.733 --> 19:38.570
You know... you know you should
put that back in, alright?

19:38.603 --> 19:41.606
- Okay.
- Yeah. You need to get your oxygen.

19:41.641 --> 19:45.477
- I know.
- Yeah. Let's go ahead and check your level.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.479
No, I haven't
stuff off my nostrils.

19:47.512 --> 19:49.882
That stuff up your nostrils
is gonna help you breathe.

19:49.916 --> 19:54.053
- Okay. Yeah, alright.
- Let's go ahead and I'll check this for you.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.395
- Yeah, so your oxy is a little low...
- Okay.

20:03.428 --> 20:05.765
- I'm really gonna need you to keep that in, okay?
- Okay.

20:05.798 --> 20:07.532
Can I have a talk
with you guys?

20:08.433 --> 20:10.736
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Come back here.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.905
See you. Okay. Bye-bye.

20:14.073 --> 20:15.908
You keep that thing
in your nose.

20:16.642 --> 20:18.077
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:19.444 --> 20:21.346
- Thanks, Lucy.
- Love you.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.890
No, no, no, that's my seat.
That's my seat.

20:31.757 --> 20:33.125
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

20:33.159 --> 20:35.560
- Oh, my God.
- What do you mean?

20:35.594 --> 20:37.730
That's your seat.

20:37.763 --> 20:41.667
- Your name is Nurse Cool?
- Is that your real name?

20:41.701 --> 20:44.670
- That's so cool.
- That's a great name.

20:44.704 --> 20:47.572
Wait, do you have to deal with
people doing that all the time?

20:47.606 --> 20:52.178
- Um, yes.
- Thank you.

20:52.211 --> 20:57.083
I get it 'cause, you know, I like to
keep myself calm. I'm very calming, so.

20:57.116 --> 21:01.419
- Yeah, and cool, okay.
- Let's get started here.

21:02.088 --> 21:08.094
So, these are your...
your... your mom's final days

21:08.127 --> 21:10.796
and I'm here to help
you guys prepare for that.

21:10.830 --> 21:13.966
And everyone needs
to do their part,

21:14.000 --> 21:18.738
alright? Your job is going to be
to help keep her comfortable,

21:18.771 --> 21:23.075
to administer
her medications.

21:23.109 --> 21:25.443
- I'll do that part.
- It's very important.

21:25.477 --> 21:27.880
You and I can...
talk about that afterwards.

21:27.914 --> 21:29.882
- You have experience in that field?
- She's a doctor.

21:29.916 --> 21:31.717
- Oh, you're a doctor?
- I am.

21:31.751 --> 21:34.120
Excellent,
she's gonna be taking opioids.

21:34.153 --> 21:36.222
And we want to keep

21:36.255 --> 21:40.126
- the dose on a time schedule.
- Yeah, I know that. I get it.

21:40.159 --> 21:43.896
We're gonna need someone
to take her vitals.

21:43.930 --> 21:47.833
This, that I've been using here,
tracks her blood oxygen level.

21:47.867 --> 21:50.002
You just put it
on her finger like this.

21:50.036 --> 21:52.905
Also you're gonna want
to start thinking about

21:52.939 --> 21:57.243
funeral arrangements or funeral homes.
I have a list that I can suggest.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.979
And I want
to suggest this book.

22:00.012 --> 22:01.579
It's called
<i>Gone from My Sight</i>.

22:02.114 --> 22:04.717
It talks
about the dying experience

22:04.750 --> 22:06.819
and it helps the family cope.

22:06.852 --> 22:10.122
They give the book to everyone,
it's just like Dying 101.

22:10.156 --> 22:14.627
Also I'm gonna ask that
you guys do a caring journal.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.963
I think that's very important.

22:16.996 --> 22:19.531
You can just jot down
how you're feeling.

22:19.564 --> 22:21.968
- You can keep one...
- I am not doing the journal.

22:22.001 --> 22:26.272
Not everyone has to do a journal.
You don't have to do a journal.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.573
I will do the journal.

22:28.606 --> 22:31.844
I would just like just
to be able to do as, like...

22:31.877 --> 22:35.848
I want to be able to know that
we've done absolutely everything,

22:35.881 --> 22:38.818
like, when Mom dies,
I don't want

22:38.851 --> 22:41.854
in a few months
from now we hear about like a...

22:42.722 --> 22:46.192
like a drug that, you know,
we didn't know about

22:46.225 --> 22:49.061
or we didn't do the research on,
I know that you're doctor and

22:49.095 --> 22:53.833
you're nurse but, like, have
you, like, had any experience

22:54.667 --> 22:56.268
with crystals or, like,

22:57.103 --> 23:00.940
certain incense,
like some oil...

23:00.973 --> 23:03.642
I mean I don't think
incense is the best...

23:03.676 --> 23:06.479
- she has O2 machine but it's okay.
- Okay.

23:08.647 --> 23:11.183
It's okay.

23:11.217 --> 23:12.985
I'm gonna leave you my card.

23:13.019 --> 23:15.587
If you guys have
any questions at all,

23:15.620 --> 23:17.622
- I want you guys to call me.
- Thank you.

23:17.656 --> 23:18.891
- You're welcome.
- Thanks, Cool.

23:18.924 --> 23:20.626
Thanks, Nurse Cool.

24:41.207 --> 24:44.643
- <i>Hey, how's it going?</i>
- It's good.

24:45.344 --> 24:47.746
<i>I wanted to make sure
that everything's working...</i>

24:47.780 --> 24:49.949
working out with your move
with your mom.

24:49.982 --> 24:51.917
Yeah, they are. Um...

24:53.152 --> 24:55.788
thank you for setting this up
for me. I appreciate it.

24:55.821 --> 24:57.723
Yeah, you got it. You got it.

24:59.191 --> 25:01.293
<i>Well, look,
this is a routine call.</i>

25:01.327 --> 25:02.995
<i>I just wanted
to make sure that, uh,</i>

25:03.863 --> 25:07.133
you're in your new location
and everything's good.

25:08.033 --> 25:09.034
Yeah.

25:09.869 --> 25:11.303
<i>So what's going on with you?</i>

25:12.872 --> 25:13.906
<i>Just, uh...</i>

25:14.974 --> 25:16.842
just checking up
with my clients.

25:18.944 --> 25:22.047
That's what I call
my... my perps.

25:22.081 --> 25:25.084
<i>Oh, am I a perp?</i>

25:31.790 --> 25:33.859
Well, look, I...

25:33.893 --> 25:36.262
I just wanted to call
and make sure that you...

25:37.029 --> 25:38.430
are okay. And...

25:39.932 --> 25:42.868
I'll be making these calls
every so often just to make sure

25:43.836 --> 25:45.037
you're doing
what you need to be doing.

25:46.205 --> 25:47.306
And it sounds like you are.

25:48.774 --> 25:50.843
I will talk to you
again later.

25:51.277 --> 25:52.945
- <i>Alright.</i>
- Bye.

25:54.013 --> 25:55.147
Bye.

26:04.823 --> 26:06.192
Mom wants
to throw a party.

26:06.959 --> 26:07.860
Okay.

26:09.528 --> 26:10.696
Okay.

26:12.064 --> 26:12.965
Okay.

26:48.567 --> 26:50.336
This book, dude,
is freaking me out.

26:51.003 --> 26:52.805
What to expect when you're
expecting someone to die.

26:53.973 --> 26:54.940
We got a checklist.

26:56.041 --> 26:57.543
- Irregular breathing.
- Yeah.

26:57.576 --> 26:59.912
- Then it goes back to normal.
- Maybe.

26:59.945 --> 27:01.480
- Surge of energy.
- Possible.

27:01.513 --> 27:04.016
- Decreased blood pressure.
- Not every time.

27:04.049 --> 27:06.118
Fish-out-of-water breathing.
What the fuck is that?

27:08.254 --> 27:11.290
You know when you do your fish out
of water and it tries to breathe.

27:13.959 --> 27:16.562
- That's awful.
- I just feel like I'm like a loaded gun just

27:16.595 --> 27:19.465
waiting like, is this the surge
of energy? Is that the breath?

27:19.498 --> 27:22.234
What's a blood pressure and like,
you're just waiting for that second.

27:22.268 --> 27:24.870
Here's something that
will give you no solace at all.

27:24.903 --> 27:28.440
People die in all sorts
of different ways at anytime.

27:29.408 --> 27:31.777
What's it like
when it's like it's?

27:33.412 --> 27:36.215
I had to lie to a family
just the other day.

27:36.248 --> 27:38.517
I look at this guy
and he's actively dying

27:38.550 --> 27:42.421
and the family is like,
"Is there anything we can do to save him?"

27:42.454 --> 27:48.927
And I have to look this beautiful
crying family in the eyes

27:50.062 --> 27:54.400
and make them believe that there
is still some kind of hope.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.408
I notice like... feel
like there's some sort of list,

28:02.441 --> 28:04.877
- like, I can just...
- Fish out of water breathing?

28:06.045 --> 28:08.380
- Yeah.
- Did you guys know grandpa?

28:09.281 --> 28:12.184
- I did not know. I had no grandpa.
- No. Apparently, he sucked.

28:12.217 --> 28:15.154
Grandpa took me fishing
and I remember he, like,

28:15.187 --> 28:19.224
took this beautiful fish
out of the water. It's like...

28:19.258 --> 28:22.861
feel like it was called
like rainbow trout and, like,

28:22.895 --> 28:25.931
so beautiful. I don't know
if it was rainbow trout,

28:25.964 --> 28:28.100
but he, like, pulled,
we were waiting all day and then

28:28.133 --> 28:32.438
he pulls this fish out
and it was like this being

28:32.471 --> 28:36.475
and it comes up
on just like, ah!

28:36.508 --> 28:40.245
And then it like... I just sat
there and I just watched it...

28:42.548 --> 28:44.149
die on the dock,

28:44.950 --> 28:51.390
going bah...

28:53.158 --> 28:55.027
Yep, that's the breathing.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.995
Okay, alright.
We'll keep an eye out for that.

29:08.641 --> 29:11.176
Adjust this
slightly up, okay?

29:11.210 --> 29:13.345
- How high should I go?
- Around eight.

29:13.379 --> 29:15.047
- Okay.
- Around eight is good.

29:15.080 --> 29:17.116
See we're already seeing
an increase.

29:17.149 --> 29:20.319
- Wee!
- That'll do it.

29:20.352 --> 29:22.121
I don't mind him
coming around.

29:35.467 --> 29:36.502
Hey, Mom.

29:43.275 --> 29:44.176
Mom.

30:02.561 --> 30:03.595
Yeah.

30:15.274 --> 30:19.712
- What? What in the world are you doing in here?
- Just...

30:20.479 --> 30:22.481
- Taking inventory?
- Taking inventory, yeah.

30:22.514 --> 30:25.117
Oh, good. Yeah,
you got to count those pills.

30:25.652 --> 30:30.723
That really matters now, right?
My little fancy Lucy.

30:30.757 --> 30:31.957
My little fancy doctor.

30:34.460 --> 30:38.464
Who would've thunk it, huh, one
of my offspring become a doctor.

30:39.264 --> 30:43.168
Thanks, Mom. You know I still
don't know if it was worth it

30:43.202 --> 30:48.040
or if I should have just
dropped out and become a mime...

30:48.073 --> 30:50.275
Or be a painter, Lucy.

30:51.376 --> 30:54.346
Didn't have to just like
so much more fun though

30:55.280 --> 30:58.751
than taking care of sick people
like me. Gross.

31:00.319 --> 31:05.557
- I don't know how you do it.
- I kind of find it fulfilling.

31:07.426 --> 31:09.428
Can you say the same
about what you do?

31:11.063 --> 31:12.030
Ouch.

31:12.732 --> 31:14.767
- I...
- Yes, you just

31:15.501 --> 31:19.104
went running as fast as you could
in the opposite direction, I guess.

31:19.137 --> 31:24.009
Yeah, I definitely
learned what I didn't want.

31:25.444 --> 31:28.681
- You're welcome.
- I found it. Look at this! Look at this!

31:30.148 --> 31:32.752
- Look...
- Sadie, what in the world...

31:32.785 --> 31:34.787
- Look at this.
- You can snoop it around.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.656
I cannot believe
that you found this.

31:36.689 --> 31:38.590
Oh, did you take
this picture, Mummy?

31:38.624 --> 31:40.660
- I did.
- I found the record.

31:40.693 --> 31:43.562
- Why, I'm certain...
- I found the Joan Anne record.

31:43.595 --> 31:46.465
- The record?
- The record.

31:47.767 --> 31:50.302
- Oh, my God!
- Isn't that nice?

31:50.335 --> 31:54.106
Yeah. I know.
I was just backstage

31:54.874 --> 31:57.309
- and right there.
- Oh, my God!

31:57.342 --> 31:59.411
I'm here to tell you,
it's like back in the day

31:59.444 --> 32:02.649
of Stevie Nicks,
Joni Mitchell and Joan Anne.

32:02.682 --> 32:07.185
There she was.
And there I was snapping away.

32:07.219 --> 32:09.187
The backstage,
it's pretty awesome.

32:09.221 --> 32:12.859
Oh, my gosh. Do you guys
remember when I dyed my hair

32:12.892 --> 32:17.262
to look just like Joan Anne and I
did, I looked just like her.

32:17.296 --> 32:19.565
Oh, my gosh, Mom,
and when I went off to college,

32:19.598 --> 32:21.300
- there is like this...
- You went to college?

32:23.135 --> 32:25.638
Oh, my God, I went for two months.
It was right before...

32:26.471 --> 32:27.674
Let's not talk about it.

32:29.541 --> 32:33.813
What we should be talking about
is should Julia go blond again

32:33.846 --> 32:38.718
and as a blond, maybe
you should stop wearing Crocs.

32:38.751 --> 32:43.255
- Ooh, interesting. Compelling argument.
- Controversial.

32:43.288 --> 32:45.290
I have had
so many conversations.

32:45.324 --> 32:46.859
I think I've had
multiple conversations

32:46.893 --> 32:49.261
with each of you
or at least one conversation

32:49.294 --> 32:51.330
with one of you
about these Crocs.

32:51.363 --> 32:53.165
I am telling you,

32:53.198 --> 32:56.602
you have not even experienced
this level

32:56.636 --> 33:01.406
of comfort and luxury until
you put them on your foot.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.409
- It is like done.
- None of us are gonna do that.

33:04.443 --> 33:08.313
- Do not... No. Do not do that.
- What does... why... why won't you put your foot into the Croc?

33:08.347 --> 33:10.817
- Because it's a Croc.
- You know what, Julia...

33:10.850 --> 33:13.418
- Just put your foot in it.
- Excuse me.

33:15.220 --> 33:16.856
I've actually been
thinking about this a lot.

33:16.889 --> 33:20.592
What I would really,
really love

33:20.627 --> 33:25.230
is that when y'all lay
my body down, okay...

33:25.263 --> 33:28.266
that you put those Crocs
on my feet

33:28.768 --> 33:32.170
and bury me in those Crocs.
That's what I want.

33:32.204 --> 33:33.806
Mommy, that would mean
so much to me.

33:33.840 --> 33:37.777
You know that way
I could rid the shame

33:38.945 --> 33:42.715
that those Crocs have brought
to this family, for real.

33:42.749 --> 33:44.549
- Alright.
- You know what I mean?

33:45.217 --> 33:48.186
That's not us. I didn't
raise you that way, Julia.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.690
We're too good for Crocs.

33:50.723 --> 33:52.624
- You are not even a gardener.
- Are you joking?

33:52.659 --> 33:54.559
Or do you want
to be buried in the Crocs?

34:47.813 --> 34:50.683
Hey, we're just picking up
worms for your mom.

34:52.284 --> 34:53.318
So you grab one.

34:54.619 --> 34:58.457
- Jesse, chill dude, why going so fast.
- They're worms, dude.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.592
You're gonna put them in shock
and they'll stop working.

35:09.001 --> 35:11.570
Hi, Mom.

35:12.370 --> 35:14.339
Hey, Julia.

35:14.372 --> 35:16.008
Hey, I made
you a cup of tea.

35:16.042 --> 35:17.442
Oh, my God.

35:18.745 --> 35:21.546
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

35:22.314 --> 35:24.382
I was just dreaming
about this cup.

35:24.884 --> 35:28.453
Mom, that's weird.
That's so connected.

35:28.487 --> 35:32.290
I know. Julia, we've always had
like that... like that weird,

35:33.525 --> 35:35.628
- like...
- Like, I've always...

35:39.598 --> 35:42.735
I've always thought of you
as a very powerful,

35:43.669 --> 35:47.339
you know, spiritual leader
of the community.

35:47.372 --> 35:50.575
And I feel
like right now more than ever

35:50.609 --> 35:53.278
you might be having some, like,

35:55.114 --> 35:58.617
Jesus like... I feel like you're
a little bit like Jesus.

36:00.585 --> 36:04.991
But, Mom, I wanted to ask you,
and you don't have to...

36:05.758 --> 36:08.961
you don't have to answer
this if you don't want to.

36:08.995 --> 36:09.929
In fact...

36:11.898 --> 36:14.332
yeah, you know what,
it's too dark.

36:14.366 --> 36:15.935
- Julia.
- It's too dark.

36:15.968 --> 36:17.637
Julia, spit it out, honey.

36:19.038 --> 36:25.011
So, like, you're here now and soon
you'll be taking a very exciting...

36:26.078 --> 36:28.848
vacation which you
will never return from.

36:31.851 --> 36:35.054
I just wanted to know...

36:36.722 --> 36:39.992
I wanted to know your thoughts and opinions
about how you would like to be buried

36:40.026 --> 36:43.062
and what type of religious
ceremony you want to have.

36:43.095 --> 36:45.530
No religion whatsoever.

36:45.564 --> 36:48.835
I was thinking I could call
the local parish

36:48.868 --> 36:51.704
- and see if they have somebody available.
- Oh, hell no. no, no.

36:51.737 --> 36:54.439
No, honey, I don't believe
in any of that crap.

36:54.472 --> 36:57.777
You're not gonna save my soul right
now, if that's what you're trying to do.

36:58.911 --> 37:02.849
You told me you believed
in God multiple times

37:04.416 --> 37:06.886
and I feel like
you're backtracking on those...

37:06.919 --> 37:09.554
- belief systems maybe.
- Oh, God, that was weird.

37:09.588 --> 37:12.357
- What happened?
- No, it was like...

37:13.092 --> 37:16.461
it was like your face went back to
like when you were six years old

37:16.494 --> 37:19.564
and then back to an adult and then
back to six and then back to an adult.

37:20.565 --> 37:23.102
Oh, now that was weird.

37:23.135 --> 37:26.504
Mommy, I can't tell right now
if you're being really cute

37:26.538 --> 37:29.574
if you're having an acid
flashback or if you're dying.

37:29.608 --> 37:33.746
No. But I liked it. That was cool,
like, to see you when you're a little.

37:34.881 --> 37:39.451
Not really. I was never
much of a singer, Julia,

37:39.484 --> 37:44.023
but you used to listen to me
and used to tell me I was good.

37:44.056 --> 37:46.125
I remember you being able
to sing better than Joan Anne.

37:46.158 --> 37:48.661
Honestly, Mom,
you're like a beautiful...

37:48.694 --> 37:50.696
Do you remember
that song, it was like...

37:50.730 --> 37:55.067

I'm so tired, Julia.

38:47.552 --> 38:49.922
- You should take a nap.
- I'm going to go.

38:52.692 --> 38:54.093
I'm going to go.

38:58.197 --> 39:01.867
Okay, Mom.
Just take a nap.

That's our opener
right there. Yeah, I liked it.

41:26.946 --> 41:29.381
- I think it's great.
- That was great. That was beautiful.

41:29.415 --> 41:31.951
Definitely let's do it.
Let's put it in the party.

41:31.984 --> 41:36.989
Julia sings opening number.
And then I think, you know, we need...

41:37.022 --> 41:41.327
- can you be on food?
- Yeah, I'll call that cornbread guide and get that barbecue.

41:41.360 --> 41:45.764
Perfect. And can you guys
go call people through the Rolodex

41:45.798 --> 41:48.868
and that's just your divide and
conquer. And then I can talk...

41:48.901 --> 41:51.904
- I don't know about that.
- Just going through the Rolodex,

41:51.937 --> 41:53.973
- so just calling...
- I don't want to do that.

41:54.006 --> 41:56.942
What if you take care of Mom and
you just be her point person,

41:56.976 --> 41:58.911
just the go-to?
Does that sound good?

41:58.944 --> 42:00.980
- Okay.
- Okay. That's what I need to do.

42:01.013 --> 42:02.848
I'll do music.
And then I think

42:02.882 --> 42:06.018
that we've got
ourselves a fucking party.

42:06.051 --> 42:08.053
Fucking hootenanny.

42:08.087 --> 42:09.755
We have a fucking hootenanny.

42:09.788 --> 42:12.725
This is great, guys.
This is awesome.

42:18.097 --> 42:19.365
Next performance.

42:20.099 --> 42:22.201
Here he goes,
turpitude dance performance.

42:22.234 --> 42:25.437
I always thought
your dancing was too sexy.

42:25.471 --> 42:28.908
I feel like when Jude would
dance at school dances and stuff,

42:28.941 --> 42:31.377
it would be like... it would
be like record scratch.

42:31.410 --> 42:33.846
Well, at least none of us
danced on the pole, right?

42:35.915 --> 42:38.817
- What's up, Mom?

Just... you can just... if you'd
just close it a little bit.

43:20.859 --> 43:22.461
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:27.166 --> 43:28.267
Hey.

43:31.070 --> 43:32.404
Oh, nice.

43:33.138 --> 43:34.974
- Isn't it great?
- Yeah, great, dude.

43:35.541 --> 43:39.511
- Ah, it's big.
- Oh yeah. Yeah. Thanks.

43:46.452 --> 43:48.487
- Jude. Your name is Jude, right?
- Yeah.

43:52.992 --> 43:54.226
It's kind of...

43:54.260 --> 43:55.327
Hold on.

43:59.265 --> 44:01.300
- Oh, that feels great.
- Yeah.

44:05.971 --> 44:07.873
Yeah.

44:07.906 --> 44:09.141
- No, it's not gonna.
- What is...

44:09.174 --> 44:11.176
It's beeping. Goddammit.

44:11.210 --> 44:13.545
- Are we in reverse?
- We can't. Just put me over.

44:13.579 --> 44:15.514
Yeah, got it.
Do you prefer it from behind?

44:15.547 --> 44:17.783
- Yeah, I like that.
- I don't like that.

44:20.953 --> 44:23.489
- This looks like this seats eight.
- I know.

44:23.522 --> 44:27.993
Oh, wow. Oh, this is better. This is better.

44:28.027 --> 44:30.229
- Goddammit.
- No, this is good.

44:30.262 --> 44:33.832
- No, I'm sorry. I can't.
- Is someone breaking into your car?

44:33.866 --> 44:37.069
No. Just... just... One more...

44:37.102 --> 44:38.937
Yeah, yeah.

44:39.639 --> 44:42.408
- Very sensitive car, man.
- Yeah.

44:42.441 --> 44:44.343
- That's good.
- Yeah.

44:49.381 --> 44:54.953
- Is it your van?
- No, it's my mom's van.

44:54.987 --> 45:00.025
Oh! oh! Oh, fuck.

45:00.059 --> 45:02.895
- Fuck.
- Oh.

45:03.663 --> 45:09.068
Oh. Thank you. Hold on. Hold
on. Oh, my God. You still going?

45:09.101 --> 45:12.071
This is roomy. What is this?
This is not an Odyssey?

45:12.104 --> 45:13.305
Oh...

45:20.212 --> 45:22.081
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

45:22.114 --> 45:23.916
Alright. Bye.

45:35.327 --> 45:36.562
Hello.

45:36.595 --> 45:37.529
Hi.

45:38.397 --> 45:40.032
You okay?

45:40.065 --> 45:41.166
Yeah.

45:42.234 --> 45:46.138
Alright. Sorry, it's just
I usually do the calling.

45:46.171 --> 45:50.109
Oh, yeah. Is this weird?

45:51.977 --> 45:54.647
Should I... this is weird.
I shouldn't have called you.

45:54.681 --> 45:58.685
- <i>I'm gonna hang up now.</i>
- No, no, no, no, no, no, it's...

45:58.718 --> 46:02.287
it's not weird,
it's just... it's just uncommon.

46:03.322 --> 46:07.627
I guess I just hadn't heard
from you in a few days and I

46:09.461 --> 46:10.562
wanted to check in.

46:11.530 --> 46:14.133
Well, I... I appreciate that.

46:14.166 --> 46:17.603
Usually, my checking calls
are just once a week.

46:18.437 --> 46:20.305
- Oh.
- <i>But...</i>

46:23.375 --> 46:25.310
thanks for being so proactive.

46:26.378 --> 46:28.180
Sure.

46:28.213 --> 46:29.348
<i>How's your week been?</i>

46:30.616 --> 46:32.251
It's been all right.

46:32.284 --> 46:33.986
How's your mom doing?

46:35.688 --> 46:38.090
What do you do? Like,

46:38.123 --> 46:41.193
<i>what do you do when you're not
like probation officer Sanchez</i>

46:41.226 --> 46:43.529
probing people?

46:44.697 --> 46:46.098
Um...

46:46.999 --> 46:48.300
<i>I don't do much really.</i>

46:49.168 --> 46:50.703
I just don't believe that.

46:53.238 --> 46:54.573
I'm pretty boring.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.141
<i>I have a dog.</i>

46:57.075 --> 46:58.544
What is your dog's name?

46:58.577 --> 47:00.012
Janice.

47:01.246 --> 47:02.414
Your dog's name is Janice?

47:04.149 --> 47:08.320
That is the dumbest dog name
I have ever heard.

47:10.322 --> 47:12.357
I mean that's the best
you could come up with?

47:12.391 --> 47:14.126
I didn't come up with that.

47:14.159 --> 47:15.762
It was my niece.

47:15.795 --> 47:18.130
First time raising
that's what she named her.

47:19.398 --> 47:21.500
- Do you have any pets?
- <i>No.</i>

47:23.469 --> 47:26.739
I can barely take care of myself.
I think you know that.

47:26.773 --> 47:28.641
I think you're doing
pretty good,

47:29.575 --> 47:32.478
and I think you're taking time
out to take care of your mom.

47:32.511 --> 47:34.279
<i>Not everybody would do that.</i>

47:36.683 --> 47:40.252
I don't want to go to AAA.
It's a cult.

47:40.285 --> 47:43.622
My sister's in like
fifty cults and she is insane.

47:44.323 --> 47:45.758
You don't have to go to AAA.

47:47.159 --> 47:49.796
- You just can't drink.
- I think I'm a terrible person.

47:49.829 --> 47:51.096
<i>You're not.</i>

47:52.264 --> 47:53.232
You don't know me.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.234
<i>I know that you've...</i>

47:56.535 --> 47:59.271
<i>you stopped your life so you can
go and take care of your mom.</i>

47:59.304 --> 48:00.272
<i>That's pretty great.</i>

48:01.473 --> 48:03.509
- <i>Okay, I should go now.</i>
- Okay.

48:05.110 --> 48:06.111
Bye.

48:22.327 --> 48:25.297
I mean it just feels so good
to be out of the house.

48:25.330 --> 48:27.834
I have been there
for like days.

48:27.867 --> 48:30.469
There were things to do, man.

48:30.502 --> 48:34.206
- There were worms to play transforming.
- Get your worms.

48:34.239 --> 48:37.442
- Gonna get your worms.
- That's a good Mom impression.

48:37.476 --> 48:41.346
- Julia, thanks for driving.
- Just trying to keep the sanctity of marriage intact.

48:41.380 --> 48:43.515
We just need a break.
Thank you so much.

48:44.550 --> 48:46.451
- Later.
- Bye.

48:49.187 --> 48:50.556
- Bye.
- Bye.

48:50.589 --> 48:53.793
- Thank you.
- Bye, babies. Bye.

49:02.835 --> 49:05.103
Okay. Cheers to that.

49:10.609 --> 49:13.646
Whoop, alright,
here we go, driving in the city.

49:19.686 --> 49:20.653
Sorry.

49:21.520 --> 49:22.521
Shit.

49:27.660 --> 49:29.729
My God.

49:37.704 --> 49:39.104
Oh, where am I?

49:39.706 --> 49:41.473
What street is this?

50:05.430 --> 50:10.703
What? Yeah? Oh! What? Uh...

50:11.771 --> 50:16.643
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!
Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Um...

50:16.676 --> 50:19.646
Hi. What is that noise?

50:20.345 --> 50:24.282
Shit. Hello,
is there anybody in here?

50:24.316 --> 50:27.954
Hello? Lucy! Lucy!

50:27.987 --> 50:29.689
Fuck.

50:29.722 --> 50:33.191
Hold on, Mom, don't die.
Hold on.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.560
What the fuck...?

50:36.696 --> 50:38.631
You fucking kidding me?

50:41.400 --> 50:43.903
Hi Nurse Cool,
there's an alarm sounding

50:43.936 --> 50:46.338
and my mom's gonna die.
Okay.

50:46.371 --> 50:48.206
Yes, I see it.

50:48.240 --> 50:49.742
It's at eight.

50:50.777 --> 50:53.478
Okay. Okay, Mommy.

50:54.914 --> 50:56.683
Okay. Ah!

51:02.789 --> 51:04.256
She breathes.

51:08.393 --> 51:09.327
Okay.

51:10.595 --> 51:13.733
Yeah, it stopped. It's... I mean
you can hear it, it stopped.

51:14.767 --> 51:17.870
No, I do... I remember now
that you told me.

51:17.904 --> 51:20.640
Yeah. Right.
Totally normal.

51:20.673 --> 51:24.877
Thank you so much.
And I will see you tomorrow.

51:24.911 --> 51:26.411
Fantastic.

51:41.894 --> 51:42.929
Handled it.

52:06.018 --> 52:08.821
Do you think that this was
the thing that kind of did it?

52:10.923 --> 52:12.557
I think
it was one of the things.

52:13.960 --> 52:16.796
It's like she was always trying to
get back up to that mountaintop.

52:18.330 --> 52:20.833
Instead, she just dug
herself into a hole.

52:24.637 --> 52:25.805
This one is so good.

52:28.941 --> 52:30.777
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

52:33.512 --> 52:34.513
Why?

52:35.882 --> 52:37.549
Can you keep a secret?

52:38.383 --> 52:39.518
No!

52:42.521 --> 52:43.723
Love you.

52:45.357 --> 52:48.694
- How many months pregnant are you?
- I'm like a week pregnant.

52:49.594 --> 52:54.000
- Oh.
- I'm like, there's a possibility that it might stick.

52:54.033 --> 52:57.502
You're like don't blow weed
smoke in my face pregnant.

52:59.105 --> 53:01.506
Aw.

53:02.541 --> 53:04.376
Is Dave so excited?

53:04.911 --> 53:06.913
He really wants it
to stick this time.

53:08.648 --> 53:09.548
It will stick.

53:10.482 --> 53:13.986
Super anxious
and stressed out people

53:14.020 --> 53:18.057
still have babies
and super calm and chill

53:18.090 --> 53:22.061
and Zen yoga moms
still have miscarriages.

53:23.663 --> 53:27.767
I think it'll be great.
And I'm also certain

53:27.800 --> 53:31.771
- that you'll fuck up some of the time.
- I'm... I'm prepared for that.

54:17.183 --> 54:19.685
Hi. How are you?

54:19.719 --> 54:21.453
I'm good.

54:23.055 --> 54:24.589
Bring it in, bring it in.

54:27.459 --> 54:31.030
I just had to come here and thank you
for helping me through my first marriage.

54:31.063 --> 54:34.466
You were so great
to me and you comforted me

54:34.499 --> 54:36.002
and you told me
what a period was.

54:36.936 --> 54:38.905
Do you remember
the El Camino?

54:38.938 --> 54:41.207
I do.

54:41.240 --> 54:43.943
You're like, I'm... I was
just drinking my whole life,

54:43.976 --> 54:46.646
- drinking, that's a crime.
- Who gives a shit, right?

54:46.679 --> 54:49.015
You're just starting out.
Did you just high-five me?

54:49.048 --> 54:52.051
You're just
always my hero. My hero.

54:52.084 --> 54:55.888
Well, one thing I do remember
is you coming to the wedding

54:55.922 --> 55:00.726
carrying this giant box,
wrapped in silver and gold, all sparkly,

55:00.760 --> 55:03.229
and inside is a big
old boxy of wine.

55:03.262 --> 55:08.634
We smuggled a lot of illegal
things in an open bed truck,

55:08.668 --> 55:11.603
- I tell you, God.
- I have some happy news.

55:11.637 --> 55:14.572
- I'm on husband number two now. Thank you.
- Oh, I like that.

55:15.808 --> 55:17.877
- We had a good luck, you know.
- We did.

55:17.910 --> 55:20.612
- Didn't we?
- Oh, hell, yes.

55:22.848 --> 55:27.253
I mean we were supposed to die
a long time ago, weren't we?

55:27.286 --> 55:29.587
- Over and over.
- Over and over.

55:32.258 --> 55:35.527
So I just wanted to thank you so
much because I realized I never have.

55:35.560 --> 55:39.231
Oh, you don't have to thank me for anything.
I'm glad I was there for you, honey.

55:39.265 --> 55:44.136
- Oh, my goodness.
- Please say hi to my momma, please.

55:48.808 --> 55:52.111
Best party ever! Whooo!

55:54.579 --> 55:57.549

Julia.

56:54.606 --> 56:56.842
I have
a few tricks in my bag.

57:01.747 --> 57:05.617
- I got something to say though.
- Yeah? Hey. Hey, you guys.

57:05.651 --> 57:08.320
- Cousin Bryan has got something to say.
- Yeah, I do. Yeah, you know...

57:08.354 --> 57:11.123
- What are you talking about?
- Something we never talked about.

57:11.157 --> 57:13.759
So I want to let you know how
I feel about everything.

57:13.793 --> 57:17.696
You know, I was doing one of those...
one of those south the border runs for you,

57:18.864 --> 57:21.834
and I drank a beer on the way
back and then I didn't mean

57:21.867 --> 57:23.636
to fall asleep at the wheel
but I did.

57:25.104 --> 57:28.307
And I'd never told you that, I appreciate
you watching out for me. I'd...

57:29.742 --> 57:32.178
that concussion
just knocked me out.

57:32.211 --> 57:34.146
So we had to have
someone to watch over me

57:34.180 --> 57:37.149
for that 24 hours and it
was you. You never said a thing.

57:37.183 --> 57:40.753
You never asked any questions.
You didn't care about the car.

57:41.420 --> 57:43.022
And I just want
to say thank you.

57:43.055 --> 57:44.957
- Repent.
- I did some dirty deeds.

57:44.990 --> 57:47.626
Dirty deeds.

57:48.227 --> 57:51.030
Just let know that
people really appreciate you

57:51.797 --> 57:52.865
and we all love you.

57:54.033 --> 57:56.135
- Thank you, Bryan.
- Cheers.

57:57.436 --> 58:01.774
I remember that. Yeah, yeah, Mom
always take care of Uncle Bryan

58:01.807 --> 58:04.243
and then I had
to take care of you guys

58:04.276 --> 58:06.011
for a week and a half
and I missed school

58:06.045 --> 58:07.746
and I had to repeat
fifth grade.

58:12.885 --> 58:17.756
- Sorry.
- You okay?

58:19.458 --> 58:20.392
Yeah, I'm okay.

58:23.229 --> 58:24.997
I'm better than okay.

58:26.732 --> 58:30.102
There are people here today that
I have not seen in over a decade.

58:31.270 --> 58:34.974
Danny Ray, where the hell
did you find him?

58:37.042 --> 58:39.345
I can't believe
he left Patty for an hour.

58:41.947 --> 58:43.115
It's a good party.

58:44.717 --> 58:45.818
It's a great party.

58:49.355 --> 58:50.723
I love you, Mom.

58:54.226 --> 58:55.661
I love you too, son.

59:03.969 --> 59:06.405
Jude. Honey.

59:07.072 --> 59:09.909
Could you do mama
one more favor today?

59:09.942 --> 59:12.378
- Yeah.
- I know you're worn out and you're tired,

59:12.411 --> 59:15.814
but, you know, I just
feel like all these people

59:15.848 --> 59:18.083
came here today to see me
and I kind of feel like

59:18.117 --> 59:19.685
I want to give
them something.

59:22.121 --> 59:24.190
- Okay.
- I want to give them some worms.

59:36.468 --> 59:39.505
<i>Cousin Bryan, he...
he bagged a bunch of them up for me.</i>

59:39.538 --> 59:41.840
<i>So all you got to do
is hand them out.</i>

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:04.530
Wait, the librarian
aged very well.

01:00:04.563 --> 01:00:07.132
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

01:00:07.166 --> 01:00:10.469
- Guys...
- What? Did you know Mom and a librarian had a thing?

01:00:10.502 --> 01:00:14.440
No. I was just giving Mom
her meds and I noticed

01:00:14.473 --> 01:00:16.842
that some of the pills
are missing, some of her opiods.

01:00:18.811 --> 01:00:20.412
How many?

01:00:20.446 --> 01:00:23.315
I don't know,
at least like a dozen, more.

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:27.086
- That's serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:31.190
- Okay.
- So do you think somebody came in during the party,

01:00:31.223 --> 01:00:33.225
like, one of her
fucking hippie friends?

01:00:33.259 --> 01:00:36.161
No, I... no one in the house.

01:00:37.596 --> 01:00:38.864
No one was in the house.

01:00:39.965 --> 01:00:41.834
Nurse Cool actually mentioned
that the other day.

01:00:42.401 --> 01:00:45.938
- What?
- What did he say?

01:00:45.971 --> 01:00:47.873
I thought he would
have told you guys about that.

01:00:47.906 --> 01:00:49.441
- No. What did he say?
- Oh...

01:00:50.542 --> 01:00:53.879
- he said that Mom's dailies...
- Yeah.

01:00:53.912 --> 01:00:58.150
...were all in order and that...
but the bottle was missing pills.

01:00:58.183 --> 01:01:00.152
I don't even know
where the bottle was stored.

01:01:00.185 --> 01:01:02.187
I don't... but he said
there was missing pills.

01:01:04.189 --> 01:01:07.293
- You should have told us.
- I thought that he was going to tell you.

01:01:07.993 --> 01:01:10.562
- He's the official...
- Why didn't... why didn't he tell us?

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:12.965
- Fuck.
- I think I...

01:01:12.998 --> 01:01:14.400
It's fucking Jude, dude.

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:20.005
He's like... like
this fucking close to a relapse.

01:01:21.273 --> 01:01:23.842
You think Jude
has been taking drugs?

01:01:23.876 --> 01:01:27.146
I mean, he had three DUIs,
like, in six months, like...

01:01:27.179 --> 01:01:29.982
I told him that

01:01:30.015 --> 01:01:31.517
- I was going to tell you guys and I forgot.
- Fuck.

01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:34.019
And I also...

01:01:34.053 --> 01:01:35.020
Oh, my God.

01:01:35.988 --> 01:01:37.089
Do you think it was him?

01:01:40.259 --> 01:01:41.193
Hey.

01:01:48.668 --> 01:01:50.069
You want to take this one?

01:01:51.437 --> 01:01:52.404
Mm-Hm.

01:01:53.673 --> 01:01:55.341
What's going on?

01:01:55.374 --> 01:01:59.178
I was giving Mom
her medication

01:01:59.211 --> 01:02:04.216
and I noticed some of her...
drugs are missing.

01:02:08.487 --> 01:02:10.389
Like, there was one rule

01:02:10.422 --> 01:02:13.926
I'd let you live in my house
on one condition.

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:18.464
- Wait, just... if you did...
- No, no,

01:02:18.497 --> 01:02:20.633
- No, no, no, no...
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:22.601
No, no, no.
No. no, no, no. No!

01:02:22.635 --> 01:02:25.237
No, no, no.
I did not. I did not.

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.473
- I did not take those drugs.
- Hey, that's okay.

01:02:27.506 --> 01:02:29.642
I don't know what you're talking
about. That was somebody else.

01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:32.411
- Do not blame this on me.
- And... and... that's okay.

01:02:32.444 --> 01:02:36.148
And if it was you, you could totally
tell us and it would be fine.

01:02:36.181 --> 01:02:40.386
I would... I didn't... I...
I pro... I swear to God.

01:02:40.419 --> 01:02:45.224
I swear to God. I swear to God,
I did not touch anything, okay?

01:02:45.257 --> 01:02:50.162
So let's just forget this
because this... this... this is...

01:02:50.195 --> 01:02:52.498
this is...
this is bullshit.

01:02:52.531 --> 01:02:56.535
I am not... I am not, okay?
I'm not...

01:02:58.705 --> 01:03:01.006
Fuck you!
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:03:05.544 --> 01:03:08.981
Good job. Good job.
That was nice.

01:03:09.014 --> 01:03:11.417
- That was nice of you both.
- Where are you going?

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:14.119
- Where are you going?
- I'm sitting down.

01:03:20.192 --> 01:03:22.060
- Do you want some ice cream?
- Yes.

01:03:32.171 --> 01:03:34.973
- Hi.
- You doing okay?

01:03:35.007 --> 01:03:39.244
No. I... my sisters are...

01:03:40.612 --> 01:03:42.749
- killing me.
- First of all, why don't you tell me what's going on?

01:03:42.782 --> 01:03:45.752
I don't have... I don't have time
to tell you what's going on.

01:03:45.785 --> 01:03:50.189
- Have you been drinking?
- Fuck you. No, I have not been drinking.

01:03:50.222 --> 01:03:53.559
And I am going to if you
don't get me out of here.

01:03:53.592 --> 01:03:58.330
We did a lot to get you moved, it's not
gonna be that easy to move you right back.

01:03:58.363 --> 01:04:01.133
You're gonna have to work through whatever
it is that you're going through right now.

01:04:01.166 --> 01:04:03.535
<i>It was pretty easy for you to
move me here in the first place.</i>

01:04:03.569 --> 01:04:04.637
No, it actually wasn't.

01:04:04.671 --> 01:04:06.305
Do the thing again.

01:04:06.338 --> 01:04:08.607
Dude, I need you to breathe.

01:04:09.308 --> 01:04:12.244
I don't know what happened
but it's just that's right now.

01:04:12.277 --> 01:04:14.480
You know what, you're full...
you are full of shit.

01:04:14.513 --> 01:04:19.618
- Dude.
- You are not being, um,

01:04:19.652 --> 01:04:23.422
- professional with me at all.
- I know that you have a lot on your plate right now, okay?

01:04:23.455 --> 01:04:28.327
God, fuck you, I don't need a fucking
therapy session. Fuck it. Bye.

01:04:29.696 --> 01:04:33.365
God fucking.

01:04:34.166 --> 01:04:39.371
Goddamn.

01:04:43.175 --> 01:04:44.476
Hi.

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:46.078
You need this?

01:04:46.578 --> 01:04:49.581
Yeah. Yes, yeah. Yes, I do.

01:04:59.091 --> 01:05:01.059
I can't...

01:05:03.763 --> 01:05:07.232
leave. I can't stay. I can't
fucking get high. I can't...

01:05:15.574 --> 01:05:16.643
Welcome home.

01:05:18.544 --> 01:05:20.379
Tell me what's going on?

01:05:22.715 --> 01:05:26.084
I'm fucking up.

01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:31.223
I'm doing everything I can
not to fuck up and I still...

01:05:32.491 --> 01:05:33.458
fuck up.

01:05:37.864 --> 01:05:40.232
This isn't a party.
This is a fucking...

01:05:41.801 --> 01:05:43.201
pageant.

01:05:45.638 --> 01:05:46.773
Siamese cat party.

01:05:48.875 --> 01:05:49.776
What?

01:05:51.243 --> 01:05:52.477
Siamese cat.

01:05:52.511 --> 01:05:54.647
Mm-Hm, I heard you.

01:05:56.883 --> 01:05:59.686
- What are you talking about?
- Like a Rolling Stone.

01:06:02.254 --> 01:06:03.790
I have no idea
what you're saying.

01:06:04.623 --> 01:06:07.426
The lyric from
"Like a Rolling Stone."

01:06:10.395 --> 01:06:13.265
Back in the day,
the Hells Angels,

01:06:13.298 --> 01:06:15.668
they... when they
were running drugs,

01:06:15.702 --> 01:06:19.204
they used to put a Siamese cat
on their shoulder

01:06:19.237 --> 01:06:21.874
to distract
the drug-sniffing dogs.

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:26.244
- What are you saying?
- What are you not getting?

01:06:26.278 --> 01:06:29.716
What the fuck is a Siamese cat
had to do with this bullshit?

01:06:36.521 --> 01:06:37.522
The worms.

01:06:41.493 --> 01:06:44.831
Oh, my God, do I have to fucking
pull it out of you? Just tell me.

01:06:47.332 --> 01:06:49.869
- Under the worms...
- Yeah.

01:06:49.902 --> 01:06:51.203
...is...

01:06:56.274 --> 01:06:57.476
Drugs?

01:07:00.212 --> 01:07:01.580
She's been mulling drugs...

01:07:05.985 --> 01:07:07.219
our whole life.

01:07:12.224 --> 01:07:15.427
Fucking... I could have had...
I could have had drugs.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.798
I could have had drugs.
I could have had free drugs.

01:07:18.831 --> 01:07:23.903
Fuck you.
Lying fucking sack of shit.

01:07:23.936 --> 01:07:26.304
Yeah, but us
accusing him might...

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:28.875
I think we should
just clean up and let him...

01:07:28.908 --> 01:07:31.510
- What if it's not him?
- Let him learn how to use... Jude.

01:07:31.543 --> 01:07:33.211
- Jude.
- Jude.

01:07:33.245 --> 01:07:34.279
Jude.

01:07:35.547 --> 01:07:38.583
What are you doing?
Why you have the worms in here?

01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:42.855
What are you doing with the...

01:07:44.523 --> 01:07:46.558
Is that a big bag of weed?

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:51.596
- Shit.
- What?

01:07:51.631 --> 01:07:54.266
Wow!

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.976
- Don't touch it. Don't get your prints on it.
- Are you okay?

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:08.246
My prints?
Is that a huge bag of cocaine?

01:08:08.915 --> 01:08:10.650
Is this yours?

01:08:11.550 --> 01:08:12.719
It's Mom's.

01:08:13.585 --> 01:08:15.520
Mom's doing coke?

01:08:15.554 --> 01:08:18.523
She's been smuggling
drugs through us for years.

01:08:20.325 --> 01:08:22.828
- What?
- Aunt Trashcan told me.

01:08:23.729 --> 01:08:30.803
She's been smuggling drugs
underneath the worms for years.

01:08:32.004 --> 01:08:35.573
Wait, what do you mean? She...

01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:40.479
I mean that everything
she's ever told you,

01:08:40.511 --> 01:08:43.314
everything she ever
pretended to be for you

01:08:44.549 --> 01:08:45.651
is a lie.

01:08:46.752 --> 01:08:49.453
And I've been telling you
this for years.

01:08:49.488 --> 01:08:53.859
Wait, she used to...
she sent me on the school bus.

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.595
Yeah, I delivered worms
all through high school.

01:08:59.564 --> 01:09:00.633
I did it, too.

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:04.536
That's what you came back
here for.

01:09:06.773 --> 01:09:07.840
You guys, I'm pregnant

01:09:09.075 --> 01:09:11.343
and I don't wanna
have a baby in jail.

01:09:11.376 --> 01:09:13.278
I want to have it
at home with my husband.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:16.381
- So I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.
- Congratulations.

01:09:16.413 --> 01:09:19.986
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's great. Okay. Well, I am leaving too.

01:09:20.019 --> 01:09:22.020
- Oh, wait, I can't.
- We gotta go.

01:09:22.054 --> 01:09:24.488
- But Mom is dying.
- I would like to not have

01:09:24.523 --> 01:09:28.694
my medical license, which I have
had for six months, revoked.

01:09:28.728 --> 01:09:30.830
- No, you're not leaving.
- Six months ago.

01:09:30.863 --> 01:09:32.932
- Nobody's leaving this house.
- We can't stay.

01:09:32.965 --> 01:09:35.734
- Nobody is leaving this house.
- Julia, you're being crazy.

01:09:35.768 --> 01:09:38.871
We are staying in this house,
we are helping our mother die.

01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:42.774
Because that's what
we're gonna do

01:09:42.809 --> 01:09:44.911
as sisters and brothers.

01:09:46.813 --> 01:09:49.081
Okay?
Because we love each other.

01:09:49.115 --> 01:09:50.950
And this week has been...

01:09:52.018 --> 01:09:54.687
absolutely the best week
of my entire life.

01:09:55.554 --> 01:09:58.791
Oh, my God, you sound like
a fucking crazy person.

01:10:00.159 --> 01:10:04.964
Are you serious? Do you understand
how much we have to lose?

01:10:04.997 --> 01:10:08.067
I don't give a fucking shit
how much we have to lose.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.735
You listen to me,
little pipsqueak?

01:10:11.170 --> 01:10:13.673
We are staying in this goddamn
fucking house together,

01:10:14.907 --> 01:10:18.110
otherwise I go to the police
and I fucking tell them

01:10:18.144 --> 01:10:20.680
and we all go to prison.
That's twenty years for you,

01:10:20.713 --> 01:10:23.115
twenty years for me,
twenty years for...

01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:25.918
actually you'd be like
two life sentences.

01:10:25.952 --> 01:10:28.587
And I'm not going back to Paul.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.489
I am not going back to my life.
And I am not going back

01:10:31.523 --> 01:10:34.660
to that Paul because you guys
don't you understand

01:10:34.694 --> 01:10:35.962
I've been trying to get us...

01:10:37.163 --> 01:10:38.463
back together...

01:10:39.866 --> 01:10:41.934
ever since Mom left
the first time.

01:10:42.635 --> 01:10:45.004
And I have been
taking the drugs,

01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:48.406
not Jude. Oh, God.

01:10:52.577 --> 01:10:55.882
- Yeah.
- You've been acting kind of high this whole week.

01:10:55.915 --> 01:10:58.383
- I'm sorry.
- I just thought it was your personality.

01:11:00.653 --> 01:11:01.854
I don't fucking know you.

01:11:03.723 --> 01:11:05.624
You're literally a different
person every time I see you.

01:11:05.658 --> 01:11:08.828
You know what it's fine.

01:11:08.861 --> 01:11:11.030
How could you fucking
do that to him?

01:11:11.063 --> 01:11:13.165
You ladies were pretty
ready to point your fingers.

01:11:13.199 --> 01:11:15.968
I didn't exactly have to prompt
you too hard on that one.

01:11:16.002 --> 01:11:17.637
Do you understand
what's happening right here?

01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:21.741
We are being manipulated
by her.

01:11:22.808 --> 01:11:24.143
This isn't between us.

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:28.014
- I'm gonna fucking talk to her.
- Every time you call me an asshole...

01:11:28.047 --> 01:11:29.949
Wait, Sadie,
what are you doing? Sadie?

01:11:29.982 --> 01:11:32.018
- I'm gonna fucking talk to her.
- Sadie.

01:11:32.051 --> 01:11:35.721
- Sadie.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:40.558
Julia, fuck off.
Fuck. Jesus.

01:11:43.963 --> 01:11:44.897
Mom.

01:11:46.999 --> 01:11:47.967
Mom.

01:11:48.768 --> 01:11:49.869
Mom.

01:11:52.672 --> 01:11:53.673
Mom!

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.011
Mom!

01:12:03.049 --> 01:12:03.950
She's alive.

01:12:04.684 --> 01:12:06.484
Hey, Mom.

01:12:06.953 --> 01:12:09.155
Pinch her right here,
she hates that.

01:12:10.588 --> 01:12:12.692
- I'm serious. Pinch her right there.
- Julia.

01:12:12.725 --> 01:12:14.660
Okay, this isn't good.
Can you call Cool?

01:12:14.694 --> 01:12:16.561
Yeah, yes. Yes.

01:12:16.594 --> 01:12:18.264
Tell him we're gonna
need more morphine.

01:12:18.297 --> 01:12:20.800
I don't understand
how to open a cell phone.

01:12:22.935 --> 01:12:25.638
- I don't even... who is...
- This is mine, here.

01:12:25.671 --> 01:12:26.739
Mom.

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:32.945
Hi, Nurse Cool. Hi.

01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:35.848
- Mom, wake up. Wake up.
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:39.617
- Wake up.
- Hey, hey, hey. She is unconscious.

01:12:42.321 --> 01:12:44.991
And Lucy wants to know
if you can-you... if...

01:12:45.024 --> 01:12:47.760
that she can administer
more morphine.

01:12:55.267 --> 01:12:57.136
<i>♪ Give me the night ♪</i>

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:04.609
<i>♪ Just give me the night ♪</i>

01:13:10.582 --> 01:13:12.184
<i>♪ Just give me the night ♪</i>

01:13:18.024 --> 01:13:20.026
<i>♪ Just give me the night ♪</i>

01:13:28.234 --> 01:13:31.937
Okay, so Mom's comfortable.

01:13:32.872 --> 01:13:35.107
I've given her morphine

01:13:35.141 --> 01:13:38.110
and she's not going to wake up.

01:13:41.613 --> 01:13:44.316
- She's not gonna wake up?
- No.

01:13:49.388 --> 01:13:50.756
So now what happens?

01:13:52.091 --> 01:13:57.096
We... we wait. It...
it could take...

01:13:57.763 --> 01:14:00.733
hours, days, weeks.

01:14:02.701 --> 01:14:03.636
Weeks?

01:14:04.637 --> 01:14:05.871
There's no way to tell.

01:14:08.374 --> 01:14:09.909
What's gonna make her...

01:14:12.011 --> 01:14:13.312
Some people...

01:14:14.313 --> 01:14:17.716
wait for loved ones
to visit them.

01:14:18.784 --> 01:14:21.619
Some people are waiting
for permission.

01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:26.358
Some people even wait
for forgiveness.

01:14:31.063 --> 01:14:33.065
If there's anything I can do,

01:14:33.099 --> 01:14:35.034
you guys have my number

01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:38.204
and I'm available, okay?

01:14:39.872 --> 01:14:41.907
- Okay.
- Thank you, Nurse Cool.

01:14:41.941 --> 01:14:43.242
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

01:14:53.719 --> 01:14:54.987
Can I talk to you?

01:14:58.891 --> 01:15:01.260
I am really sorry
about how I acted earlier.

01:15:02.695 --> 01:15:03.662
It's okay.

01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:07.900
I just don't really
know how much you know about

01:15:07.933 --> 01:15:09.869
kind of how
things went down.

01:15:14.473 --> 01:15:16.408
Is there something
you think I should know?

01:15:16.442 --> 01:15:18.077
I just feel really guilty.

01:15:19.078 --> 01:15:22.281
- Why?
- Because I... I want you to...

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:27.319
not have to know,
like, about everything.

01:15:27.987 --> 01:15:28.888
Tell me.

01:15:30.055 --> 01:15:31.657
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:15:35.461 --> 01:15:37.930
Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:38.898 --> 01:15:43.469
So, I was in college
and I was trying to do my thing

01:15:43.502 --> 01:15:46.872
and I got a phone call
from a social worker

01:15:46.906 --> 01:15:48.807
that you'd been taken
from the house

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:51.310
and that you were staying
with Aunt Trashcan

01:15:52.344 --> 01:15:53.679
because Mom...

01:15:56.215 --> 01:15:58.450
had been arrested and...

01:16:00.419 --> 01:16:03.822
charged with possession
with intent to sell.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.963
And she was sentenced
to five to seven years,

01:16:13.899 --> 01:16:15.467
but she only served one year.

01:16:21.974 --> 01:16:25.110
And we lied to you when
we told you that she was...

01:16:25.144 --> 01:16:26.078
In Paris.

01:16:27.947 --> 01:16:31.750
It was Paris, Texas,
a women's facility there.

01:16:38.457 --> 01:16:39.358
Wow.

01:16:43.128 --> 01:16:46.465
So, I got in the car and I drove
back here as fast as I could

01:16:46.498 --> 01:16:48.500
and I got back
to the house and...

01:16:53.205 --> 01:16:54.139
Jude...

01:16:55.307 --> 01:16:57.209
had overdosed...

01:16:59.845 --> 01:17:00.813
and he...

01:17:04.016 --> 01:17:05.017
flatlined.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.489
And I thought
he was gonna die that night.

01:17:14.093 --> 01:17:16.528
And he... I mean he did die
for a minute.

01:17:19.598 --> 01:17:21.100
And Mom was gone.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:25.971
And I didn't go back
to college.

01:17:26.005 --> 01:17:29.541
And I went and I...
and I found Paul,

01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:33.078
so I could stick around.

01:17:35.047 --> 01:17:36.282
I'm so sorry.

01:17:39.985 --> 01:17:43.856
I'm so sorry that you didn't get to do what
you wanted 'cause you were taking care of me.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.428
Thank you so much.

How's it going out there?

01:20:26.753 --> 01:20:29.988
I found out what Aunty Trashcan
is called Aunty Trashcan.

01:20:30.022 --> 01:20:31.758
It's because she's been
smuggling drugs

01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:35.427
from Mexico to Canada
my whole life.

01:20:36.361 --> 01:20:38.230
Okay.

01:20:39.598 --> 01:20:44.570
I found out that the photo,
Joan Anne record,

01:20:46.438 --> 01:20:47.973
<i>she didn't take it.</i>

01:20:49.642 --> 01:20:53.212
<i>And I thought that was
her thing, being a photographer,</i>

01:20:53.245 --> 01:20:56.048
so I decided to be
a photographer because of her

01:20:56.081 --> 01:20:58.116
and she didn't fucking
take it.

01:21:01.153 --> 01:21:04.122
So, basically, my whole
fucking life is based on a lie.

01:21:05.792 --> 01:21:09.394
Sadie, you just take a breath.
Take a breath, okay?

01:21:12.464 --> 01:21:15.434
I really don't want to do this.
I'm a wreck.

01:21:18.303 --> 01:21:23.208
Let's... let's talk about this.

01:21:25.511 --> 01:21:28.213
<i>She has served
as a cautionary tale.</i>

01:21:29.381 --> 01:21:31.784
<i>Listen, you guys need to just...</i>

01:21:32.551 --> 01:21:36.756
this isn't for you
to sift through right now.

01:21:37.523 --> 01:21:40.158
I just wanna let
this all go, you know.

01:21:43.763 --> 01:21:47.232
I don't know how to let her go.
I don't know how to let her just go.

01:21:47.266 --> 01:21:50.135
She seems like she's suffering.
It seems like everyone is suffering

01:21:50.168 --> 01:21:51.503
and I just want it to stop.

01:21:52.237 --> 01:21:55.440
Maybe you guys
just need to lie.

01:21:57.142 --> 01:21:59.812
<i>Give her some kind of closure
that you know she's looking for.</i>

01:21:59.846 --> 01:22:01.613
<i>I know that's exactly
what she's looking for.</i>

01:22:01.648 --> 01:22:02.782
You think I should lie to her?

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:09.421
You lie to your mother. You tell
her she was the greatest person.

01:22:09.454 --> 01:22:12.257
You were so blessed
to be her daughter.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:15.360
And these are her last days maybe
that's what she needs to hear.

01:22:18.263 --> 01:22:19.197
Okay.

01:22:23.335 --> 01:22:24.303
I'm gonna do it?

01:22:28.641 --> 01:22:29.842
I'm gonna do it.

01:22:32.611 --> 01:22:33.746
Fucking lie to her.

01:22:39.217 --> 01:22:41.888
What? Got a plan.

01:22:41.921 --> 01:22:44.523
We did all the things
in the book

01:22:45.357 --> 01:22:49.094
and what we haven't tried yet
is we're gonna lie to her.

01:22:51.296 --> 01:22:52.364
We're all gonna lie to her.

01:22:53.265 --> 01:22:54.000
About what?

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.535
Whatever the fuck
she wants to hear

01:22:56.568 --> 01:22:57.569
we're gonna tell her

01:22:57.603 --> 01:22:58.570
so she can die.

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:09.214
Okay.

01:23:11.818 --> 01:23:15.655
- We're gonna...
- You said like fighting fire with fire?

01:23:27.767 --> 01:23:30.502
<i>My mother lied to me
my entire life.</i>

01:23:31.971 --> 01:23:33.605
I don't want to lie.

01:23:34.941 --> 01:23:37.342
<i>Well, then why don't
you just tell her the truth?</i>

01:23:39.211 --> 01:23:41.613
Don't let your sister
or anybody else take this

01:23:42.547 --> 01:23:43.916
and make it about them.

01:23:47.252 --> 01:23:48.620
<i>This is why you're there.</i>

01:23:51.924 --> 01:23:53.660
So far you're doing pretty good.

01:24:01.366 --> 01:24:02.669
<i>I'm really glad you called.</i>

01:24:08.975 --> 01:24:09.876
I am, too.

01:24:14.346 --> 01:24:15.547
I love you

01:24:16.683 --> 01:24:22.320
and I am so grateful
for this time

01:24:24.924 --> 01:24:25.958
and...

01:24:28.593 --> 01:24:29.629
I forgive you.

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:33.633
I forgive you for all of it.

01:24:40.272 --> 01:24:43.009
I remember when you slept through my
wedding that time and you were like,

01:24:43.042 --> 01:24:45.444
"I don't really know about that guy Dave.
He seems like a scorer."

01:24:45.477 --> 01:24:47.680
And I was like,
"Wait, I love him."

01:24:47.714 --> 01:24:49.782
You know you might be right,

01:24:50.783 --> 01:24:53.552
you know.
Maybe I deserve better.

01:24:53.585 --> 01:24:55.855
Maybe I should like aim higher

01:24:55.888 --> 01:24:58.991
and not like get all tied down
with kids, you know,

01:24:59.959 --> 01:25:02.594
stay open, like you said.

01:25:05.530 --> 01:25:10.368
So I just want you
to know that we are good.

01:25:12.304 --> 01:25:13.706
You should feel...

01:25:19.979 --> 01:25:20.980
you should feel good.

01:25:24.917 --> 01:25:27.854
Joan Anne came to me
in a dream last night

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.790
and she said
that she was waiting for you.

01:25:32.992 --> 01:25:38.898
She was there with Jimi Hendrix
and she was there with The Grate...

01:25:39.564 --> 01:25:43.002
the Grateful Dead
and Janis Joplin

01:25:44.871 --> 01:25:47.807
and they are having a party,
an acid party.

01:25:51.543 --> 01:25:53.846
They'd put the acid in a huge,

01:25:56.581 --> 01:25:59.786
like, forty-ounce
of Jack Daniels

01:25:59.819 --> 01:26:02.587
with a little thing on the end
then we could all drink it.

01:26:03.355 --> 01:26:06.659
And I don't forgive you for
nothing 'cause you're perfect.

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:10.328
I know
I'm gonna miss you a lot.

01:26:19.404 --> 01:26:20.673
Why am I here, Mom?

01:26:21.974 --> 01:26:24.710
I can't believe it.
I feel for this.

01:26:24.744 --> 01:26:27.412
I feel for this.
I feel for this all again.

01:26:36.454 --> 01:26:39.524
I don't want to say goodbye
because I don't...

01:26:41.127 --> 01:26:43.896
know who I'll...
I don't know who I'll be

01:26:43.930 --> 01:26:47.066
if I don't have you around
to blame for everything.

01:26:53.773 --> 01:26:54.907
We're the same.

01:27:00.179 --> 01:27:01.881
We both hate reality.

01:27:03.883 --> 01:27:07.720
So we do anything we can
to try and...

01:27:09.655 --> 01:27:10.723
avoid it.

01:27:16.662 --> 01:27:19.497
Actually, I think I had
a really great childhood

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:23.836
even if you weren't in it
all that much.

01:27:27.073 --> 01:27:29.976
They were
all the family I needed.

01:28:11.050 --> 01:28:11.951
She's dead.

01:28:13.485 --> 01:28:15.922
Mom's dead.

01:28:51.157 --> 01:28:54.592
We should probably burn those
drugs before Nurse Cool comes.

01:28:55.962 --> 01:29:01.100
We're gonna burn a bunch
of weed, send of smoke signals?

01:29:01.133 --> 01:29:04.469
Or maybe we can flush the weed
and then burn the drugs.

01:29:05.304 --> 01:29:06.205
Yeah.

01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:10.776
Yeah, we gotta
get rid of those drugs.

01:29:13.913 --> 01:29:15.513
- Hey, hey.
- What?

01:29:15.547 --> 01:29:17.183
- It's fine.
- Okay.

01:29:25.658 --> 01:29:26.859
There's some more in there.

01:29:28.694 --> 01:29:29.962
Hey, pass me
some more, too.

01:29:30.730 --> 01:29:32.732
- No, there's more in the bag.
- Yeah.

01:29:33.833 --> 01:29:35.101
Well, that's it. That's all.

01:29:36.601 --> 01:29:38.237
No, no, no, no, no...
we need to flush that.

01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:39.939
We need to flush
that one down the toilet.
