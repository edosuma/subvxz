The game starts in 10 minutes.

00:27.950 --> 00:31.450
It took me a half an hour to get this piece of crap started.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.020
I think we should take your car.

and we're late because you drive the only car they ever stole in mexico

00:46.600 --> 00:48.350
and brought here to sell.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.370
There anything you wanna tell me?

01:18.700 --> 01:20.520
What do you--you think i know something about this?

01:20.550 --> 01:25.080
I have never,ever seen that woman before,alive or dead.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.020
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.What the hell are you doing?

01:28.050 --> 01:29.990
I'm calling it in.What do you think i'm doing?

01:30.010 --> 01:33.680
Do that,and 5 minutes from now,this place'll be crawling with cops.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.900
Man,man,come on. Think.

01:35.920 --> 01:38.520
Would you rather spend the next 2 hours standing in my driveway,

01:38.540 --> 01:43.530
filling out paperwork or sitting in a skybox at dodger stadium?

01:51.910 --> 01:53.730
I promise you,when we get back from the game,

01:53.750 --> 01:57.360
blondie here will still be dead.

01:57.890 --> 01:58.900
What the hell are you doing now?

01:58.930 --> 02:01.120
I'm taking some pictures.Do you mind?

Hey,relax. How about if we pretend like we're police officers?

02:06.430 --> 02:08.180
All right,all right,look,

02:08.350 --> 02:11.720
if my car starts,we go to the game.

02:11.740 --> 02:16.140
If it doesn't,we stay,and we deal with this.

You look left.I'll look right.

03:47.110 --> 03:50.230
If I was a dead body,where would I go?

Tao.

Mike,andy flynn.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.250
Yeah,can you do me a favor?

03:57.270 --> 04:01.240
Can you check and see if there's been any rollout in the past hour?

04:35.390 --> 04:36.720
Can I help you two?

04:36.760 --> 04:40.720
Thanks,commander,but it's more a question of us helping you.

04:42.010 --> 04:44.330
Commander taylor,can you look at this?

04:52.940 --> 04:54.370
It's her,right?

04:55.460 --> 04:56.730
Yeah,but in your garage,

04:56.750 --> 05:00.310
she definitely was dressed and not cut open.

05:07.310 --> 05:08.840
All right,move--move away from the body.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.710
Both of you,move--move back. Back.

05:10.740 --> 05:11.860
Why?

05:11.890 --> 05:15.890
Commander,priority homicide is taking over this crime scene.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.340
The hell you are.

05:17.380 --> 05:21.580
You don't have the authority to take over this investigation.

05:22.100 --> 05:25.360
Chief johnson sent us.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.250
With me,with me,with me.

05:39.470 --> 05:41.010
What the hell is going on around here?

05:41.030 --> 05:42.040
I just got off the phone with taylor,

05:42.060 --> 05:44.710
who was angrier than I've ever heard him,and you know what that's saying.

05:44.740 --> 05:47.690
Will,I have no idea what you're talking about.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.380
Since when do you allow flynn and provenza to walk off the streets

05:50.410 --> 05:53.250
and try to take over crime scenes?

05:57.950 --> 06:01.600
First off,will,you yell at me when i don't delegate authority,

06:01.630 --> 06:02.790
and then you yell at me when I do.

06:02.810 --> 06:03.780
Oh,come on.Don't give me that.

06:03.810 --> 06:05.830
Give you what? I'm--

06:05.870 --> 06:08.490
I'm tryin' to figure out how to run my squad to keep you happy.

06:08.520 --> 06:11.120
Well,you can start by telling me what is so important about this dead girl

06:11.130 --> 06:16.450
that flynn and provenza would disrespect taylor like that in front of a dozen officers.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.520
Well,this dead girl--
woman.Whatever. Sorry.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.890
It's not every day a body turns up...

06:21.910 --> 06:23.020
in that condition.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.880
Mutilated corpses are a dime a dozen around here.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.610
Yes,but the way she was mutilated.

06:26.630 --> 06:27.840
Cut open,probably for drugs.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.270
That makes her what,the third this year?

06:29.290 --> 06:32.460
Yes,but how many mutilated corpses turned up...

06:32.490 --> 06:34.260
where she turned up?

06:34.300 --> 06:36.900
In a secluded strip of land off sepulveda?

06:36.920 --> 06:39.070
Do you have any idea who owns that land?

06:39.100 --> 06:43.950
No,I don't,but since you have all the answers,why don't you tell me?

06:44.750 --> 06:46.220
You know what,will?

06:46.240 --> 06:48.450
I don't appreciate your condescending tone,

06:48.470 --> 06:52.390
and I don't enjoy being grilled like I'm some suspect off the street.

06:52.410 --> 06:56.450
Now,I'll explain everything when I have all the information,

06:56.480 --> 06:59.020
which is coming in downstairs,where I'm not,

06:59.050 --> 07:00.400
so if you'll excuse me.

07:00.430 --> 07:02.140
Yeah,I'll excuse you for now,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.840
but I can't speak for the rest of parker center,

07:03.870 --> 07:07.440
and eventually this will have to be explained.

07:14.630 --> 07:18.120
Everything all right,chief?
What do you think,sergeant?!

07:25.680 --> 07:29.670
Where are provenza and flynn?!

07:30.650 --> 07:32.580
That was not a rhetorical question.

07:32.610 --> 07:36.080
Where are flynn and provenza?!

07:36.220 --> 07:37.360
Off duty.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.970
Clearly they are not off duty,

07:38.990 --> 07:41.070
because they're taking over crime scenes.

07:41.100 --> 07:42.970
Detective daniels,get on the phone and find them.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.050
Now. Now!

07:47.900 --> 07:54.110
Did I ever once imply that I would allow y'all to make up the rules as you went along?

07:54.130 --> 07:54.660
No.
Definitely not.

07:54.690 --> 07:55.540
Not a chance,chief.

07:55.570 --> 08:00.620
Are you aware that this is exactly the type of conduct i was brought to this department to end?

08:00.650 --> 08:02.630
Definitely 
Yes,chief.

08:06.740 --> 08:10.050
have you people heard of the word "protocol"?

08:10.070 --> 08:13.790
I will not be blindsided in pope's office trying to figure what the...

08:13.810 --> 08:15.920
heck you people are up to! Yes?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.740
What is it,detective sanchez?

08:35.750 --> 08:39.419
Gentlemen,I want an explanation.

08:39.450 --> 08:42.240
Well,you know I've been having a lot of trouble with my car lately.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.830
Crime scene,lieutenant flynn.

08:43.850 --> 08:45.100
Get me to the crime scene.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.990
Well,we decided to take my car to the game.

08:47.030 --> 08:51.050
Only,when we opened my garage door,there was a body on the floor.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.300
A body?

08:52.330 --> 08:56.570
Um,dead female,caucasian,mid-30s.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.370
When was this?

08:58.430 --> 08:59.760
About 2 hours ago.

08:59.790 --> 09:04.900
Only,we decided not to call it in right at that very moment.

09:04.940 --> 09:07.300
Because...

09:13.720 --> 09:16.600
skybox tickets?!

09:17.030 --> 09:21.300
When we,uh--when we got back to my garage,the body was gone.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.480
Ahem. Fortunately,it turned up.

09:23.520 --> 09:28.230
Uh,but by then,the victim,uh,had been stripped and cut open.

09:28.230 --> 09:32.610
Robbery/homicide was processing what they thought was the murder scene,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.390
which we knew it wasn't,

09:34.420 --> 09:37.330
so I told commander taylor that...

09:37.360 --> 09:40.460
priority homicide was taking over the case.

09:40.510 --> 09:42.540
Why would you do that?

09:44.060 --> 09:45.200
'Cause I felt,uh,

09:45.230 --> 09:47.690
we needed to take control of the situation.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.610
And how does that seem to be workin' out?

09:49.640 --> 09:51.380
Look,I'm not saying that mistakes weren't made.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.650
Do you think so,lieutenant flynn?

09:56.990 --> 10:01.690
And take off those idiotic baseball caps.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.310
Lieutenant provenza,

10:06.340 --> 10:08.610
tell me about the death of this woman.

10:08.640 --> 10:12.050
The victim looked like she'd been dead 3,4 hours when we found her.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.330
Well,that's true,chief.

10:13.350 --> 10:14.790
Rigor mortis had set in,

10:14.820 --> 10:17.080
but there was very little lividity.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.930
In fact,if you take a look at these pictures--

10:19.970 --> 10:22.160
you didn't have time to call it in,

10:22.180 --> 10:24.040
but you had time to take pictures?

10:24.070 --> 10:25.420
I wanted to call it in.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.080
Oh,yeah. Yeah,sure.Yeah,blame it all on me.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.350
Well,it's your damn garage. Look,I'm not goin' down for this.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.190
You rat fink.
Enough!Both of you!

10:32.230 --> 10:37.870
Sittin' on this information makes me an accomplice after the fact and twice as negligent as y'all.

10:37.900 --> 10:42.450
What I really should do is call a meeting right now between taylor and pope.

10:50.490 --> 10:53.530
Just...go home.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.800
Is that how they say,"you're fired," in the south?

10:56.830 --> 10:59.840
Your garage is a crime scene.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.050
Lieutenant provenza,go home and wait for me there.

11:23.050 --> 11:27.490
Lieutenant flynn,with me,with me,with me.

11:32.690 --> 11:36.480
you are aSking us to participate in an unauthorized investigation?

11:36.480 --> 11:38.570
It's worse than that.

11:38.720 --> 11:44.330
I'm asking you to be a party to an act of negligence that could compromise your careers.

11:44.350 --> 11:48.740
However,I believe that we can resolve this dilemma if we all work together.

11:48.850 --> 11:53.610
I'll need someone to analyze the photos that lieutenant flynn took from his cellphone,

11:53.630 --> 11:57.460
someone to stay in touch with robbery/homicide and report back to me on their progress,

11:57.500 --> 12:04.730
and someone,preferably a former S.I.D. Officer,to help process the garage.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.990
And what about sergeant gabriel?

12:07.020 --> 12:09.240
I think he should remain in the dark.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.980
Eventually we might need help from someone

12:11.000 --> 12:15.410
who hasn't been tainted by ill-gotten information.

12:15.440 --> 12:20.230
And we have to wrap up the murder without letting anyone know where the body was found?

12:20.270 --> 12:22.360
That is a necessity.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.790
Lieutenant tao,detective sanchez and daniels,

12:26.820 --> 12:29.820
the choice to assist is entirely yours.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.980
If you'd prefer to remain on the outside,

12:32.000 --> 12:35.710
you'll have plausible deniability,and...

12:35.920 --> 12:39.000
I won't think any less of you.

12:45.250 --> 12:47.870
You can see by the photo that the back door was closed,

12:47.890 --> 12:50.240
but later it was open,and the lock was broken,

12:50.270 --> 12:54.930
suggesting that the victim or whoever brought her in here originally had a key.

12:54.960 --> 12:57.780
And whoever dragged her out did not.

12:57.810 --> 13:01.920
That also suggests the landlord didn't change the lock before I moved in like I asked,

13:01.950 --> 13:04.210
which suggests that i should sue his ass.

13:04.230 --> 13:07.940
Do you have anything useful to add,lieutenant provenza?

13:08.010 --> 13:09.620
Uh,yeah.

13:09.680 --> 13:11.310
Yeah. The,uh...

13:11.350 --> 13:13.010
the victim was wearing heels,

13:13.030 --> 13:14.830
but there weren't any imprints,

13:14.870 --> 13:17.020
so that means,uh,she didn't walk in.

13:17.020 --> 13:19.390
She was carried in and laid to her rest.

13:19.410 --> 13:23.650
Whoever broke in was either in a big hurry or incredibly careless,

13:23.670 --> 13:27.780
'cause I just pulled 3 fresh prints off the door handle.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.190
Chief johnson.

13:35.220 --> 13:39.660
Yeah,uh,robbery/homicide just got a positive I.D. On the victim,chief.

13:39.690 --> 13:41.540
Her name is katherine landis.

13:41.580 --> 13:43.330
Katherine landis.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.810
Good. I want financials,priors,parking tickets,

13:45.840 --> 13:47.980
phone records,anything you can find on her.

13:48.010 --> 13:49.210
Right away,chief.

13:49.230 --> 13:51.780
Detective sanchez has some info for you.

13:53.490 --> 13:57.280
Chief,when I enlarged flynn's photos,

13:57.310 --> 14:02.180
I noticed what looked like the edge of an airline ticket envelope sticking out of the victim's pocket.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.760
I matched the insignia to aero escondido,

14:04.790 --> 14:07.400
a tiny airline connecting oaxaca and los angeles.

14:07.430 --> 14:12.210
Good. Find out if aero escondido had any flights arriving in lax in the last 12 hours,

14:12.240 --> 14:13.290
and if they did,

14:13.290 --> 14:17.080
please locate the security tapes in the 2 hours following arrival.

14:17.110 --> 14:18.500
Thank you,detective sanchez.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.410
Thank you.

14:19.440 --> 14:20.390
Chief.
Yes.

14:20.410 --> 14:23.530
Ahem. You know how i said I--I didn't know the victim?

14:23.560 --> 14:28.610
Well,I didn't,but I-it turns out i have been...

14:28.840 --> 14:31.000
I have been reading her mail.

14:31.030 --> 14:31.640
What?!

14:31.670 --> 14:34.630
Look,this landis woman was the tenant here before me,

14:34.650 --> 14:36.540
and she didn't leave a forwarding address.

14:36.570 --> 14:40.560
So we keep getting information we can't use in a case we don't have.

14:40.600 --> 14:43.830
Lieutenant,I want a copy of the coroner's report as soon as it's dictated,

14:43.860 --> 14:46.170
and don't show it to anyone else before you show it to me.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.350
Thank you.

14:47.390 --> 14:51.280
We are calling everyone who had keys to this garage,

14:51.320 --> 14:52.700
starting with your landlord.

14:52.730 --> 14:54.460
Aw,jeez.Do we have to do that?

14:54.490 --> 14:55.540
I mean,my lease is up.

14:55.570 --> 14:59.550
If we harass this guy,I know he's gonna raise my rent.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.080
Quickly,quickly,quickly.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.140
Would you look at this?

15:08.160 --> 15:10.730
Now I have to replace the lock and reset the damn door.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.550
There's no rush.

15:11.570 --> 15:14.620
Whenever you get around to it's fine with me.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.840
Mr. Sarkesian,what can you tell us about the previous tenant?

15:17.870 --> 15:19.760
I believe her name was kathy landis.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.200
Ask the neighbors.

15:21.230 --> 15:23.210
Excuse me,mr. Sarkesian.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.800
I don't think i've made clear exactly who I am.

15:25.830 --> 15:29.040
I'm deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the L.A.P.D.,

15:29.080 --> 15:30.310
And I don't give tickets.

15:30.350 --> 15:31.360
I arrest people.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.000
So unless you're certain that every property you own

15:34.000 --> 15:36.930
is in complete compliance with all municipal housing codes,

15:36.950 --> 15:38.970
I'd answer my questions without hesitation.

15:38.990 --> 15:41.660
Do we understand each other,sir?

15:42.950 --> 15:47.730
Kathy landis lived here 4,5 years ago while she was pregnant.

15:48.590 --> 15:50.750
Give me a screwdriver!

15:53.530 --> 15:56.720
And the father of her child,did he live here as well?

15:56.770 --> 16:00.540
No,no. Mr. Spengler,he and his wife lived in los feliz.

16:00.570 --> 16:02.830
They were paying her to have their baby.

16:02.860 --> 16:05.260
I'm surprised you remember their name,mr. Sarkesian.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.790
I remember the people who write the checks.

16:07.820 --> 16:11.330
After the baby was born,they stopped paying.

16:11.360 --> 16:14.720
I never got another dime from that worthless bitch.

16:14.770 --> 16:17.300
Hold that thought,would you?

16:21.540 --> 16:22.360
Chief johnson.

16:22.390 --> 16:25.000
They picked up the victim's boyfriend,scott campbell.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.260
Oh,thank you,detective daniels.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.690
Just try and stall that interview as long as possible.

16:29.720 --> 16:31.340
We're heading back now.

16:31.570 --> 16:34.270
Thank you so much for your help,mr. Sarkesian.

16:34.310 --> 16:37.500
Oh,and,um,since prior to moving in,

16:37.540 --> 16:40.830
lieutenant provenza had asked for the locks to be changed and they weren't,

16:40.860 --> 16:42.540
I'm obliged to report that violation.

16:42.770 --> 16:48.060
Unless of course you might be able to renew his lease at the current rate.

16:48.420 --> 16:49.800
Yeah.
Thank you.

16:49.830 --> 16:51.700
Thank you so much.

16:58.160 --> 17:00.790
When they picked up landis' boyfriend,scott campbell,

17:00.820 --> 17:05.260
there was a knife and 20 condoms filled with black-tar heroin in his car.

17:05.300 --> 17:07.089
You think scott campbell killed her for the dope?

17:07.119 --> 17:09.660
No. She was dead when campbell cut her open.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.710
We know that,because it was after she was removed from lieutenant provenza's garage,

17:13.740 --> 17:17.119
and whoever removed the body's not the same person who put it there.

17:17.160 --> 17:18.530
But what if she wasn't murdered,

17:18.560 --> 17:20.440
if one of the condoms broke and she overdosed?

17:20.470 --> 17:22.700
No. The victim would have suffered seizures,

17:22.740 --> 17:25.280
thrown up,probably bitten her lips and tongue.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.670
From the angle of her head,

17:26.690 --> 17:28.780
I'd say her neck was broken.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.530
Aero escondido had one flight arrive this morning,and landis was on it.

17:33.570 --> 17:34.760
Security tape's on the way.

17:34.790 --> 17:37.030
Good. Also landis worked as a surrogate,

17:37.060 --> 17:40.350
so make sure that tao has the coroner do a pregnancy check.

17:40.390 --> 17:47.310
Chief,if you want to stop campbell from saying where he found the body,you better hurry.

17:53.130 --> 17:55.910
Why aren't they using robbery/homicide's interview room?

17:55.940 --> 17:57.990
Technical problems with their monitors.

17:58.010 --> 18:02.270
Bless me,reverend mother,for I have sinned.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.880
We are all goin' to hell.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.660
Don't give me that bullshit.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.910
3 hours ago,I was as close to her as I am to you right now.

18:10.940 --> 18:12.980
You think I wanted to defile her that way?

18:13.020 --> 18:14.530
I--I loved kathy.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.990
We were--we were getting ready to have a kid.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.080
We were gonna be a family.

18:18.110 --> 18:20.790
If you loved her,then why did you kill her and leave her with her intestines--

18:20.820 --> 18:22.760
she was dead when I found her!

18:22.800 --> 18:25.630
Goodness,what have i walked in on?

18:25.780 --> 18:29.990
Well,thanks to your allowing robbery/homicide to keep this investigation,

18:30.020 --> 18:32.320
the victim's boyfriend is about to confess.

18:32.350 --> 18:35.110
Oh,well,that's great.

18:35.140 --> 18:36.400
Do you mind if I observe?

18:36.440 --> 18:39.180
Oh,be my guest.
Thank you.

18:39.210 --> 18:41.140
Thank you so much.

18:41.660 --> 18:45.490
I had to get the drugs,because if I didn't,I was dead.

18:45.520 --> 18:47.510
Do you understand?
Actually,no,I don'T.

18:47.530 --> 18:49.360
This one looks as guilty as sin,doesn't he?

18:49.400 --> 18:50.260
Start from the beginning.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.120
Kathy called me from the airport.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.920
When--when she hadn't shown up 2 hours later,

18:53.940 --> 18:55.520
I pinged her G.P.S. Phone.

18:55.550 --> 18:56.270
You pinged it?

18:56.290 --> 18:58.780
I-it gave me her location.

18:59.650 --> 19:03.490
Buzz,it is just amazing to me what a suspect will say without their lawyer present.

19:03.520 --> 19:10.370
Why,this grilling would grind to a halt if a suspect asked for a lawyer he's entitled to.

19:13.710 --> 19:15.260
Oh,no.

19:15.290 --> 19:16.660
Oh,no.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.980
No. Did y'all hear that in there?

19:24.450 --> 19:26.390
What just happened?

19:26.430 --> 19:30.540
I-I'm not sayin' anything else till I get a lawyer.

19:30.580 --> 19:33.120
I want my lawyer.

19:35.640 --> 19:37.160
Ok,before I was angry.

19:37.190 --> 19:40.730
Now I'm worried,and--and frankly I'm baffled.

19:40.770 --> 19:42.860
Will,this was a complete accident.

19:42.900 --> 19:47.080
And I suppose provenza and flynn trying to take over the murder scene this afternoon,

19:47.110 --> 19:49.800
that was a complete accident,too,huh?

19:49.840 --> 19:54.460
Deputy chief johnson,was what just happened down there really an idiotic mistake,

19:54.500 --> 19:57.450
or is there something you're not telling me?

19:59.370 --> 20:03.400
You have information from the F.B.I.,Don't you?

20:04.480 --> 20:06.050
Yes.

20:06.090 --> 20:07.760
Yes,I--I do,will.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.320
I--I will deny saying it,

20:09.330 --> 20:14.800
but this case isn't about one woman cut open for drugs and dumped on sep-ul-vedda avenue.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.590
Sepulveda boulevard.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.120
She doesn't even know the name of the street.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.670
There may be evidence that campbell cut open and disposed of 4,5,

20:23.700 --> 20:27.060
who knows how many women the same way in nevada,arizona.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.630
So we're talking about a multistate scenario.

20:28.650 --> 20:29.660
Exactly. Exactly.

20:29.690 --> 20:30.800
A multistate scenario.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.590
That is it.

20:32.660 --> 20:36.440
And the F.B.I. Is within one day at the most of taking over this case.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.590
And wh-what about the D.E.A.?And they involved,too?

20:41.260 --> 20:44.590
Chief pope,I have already said too much.

20:45.030 --> 20:47.420
And I really mean that.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.770
Fritz. Uhh. I may have made a terrible mistake.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.910
No one's telling me anything.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.430
Can't you just level with me?

20:54.470 --> 20:56.210
Is there someone outside,detective?

20:56.240 --> 20:58.090
Uh,yeah.It's sergeant gabriel.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.690
Oh. Tell him about the special job we have for him.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.170
The special job.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.390
Right. Uh...

21:04.420 --> 21:11.330
look,david,the chief wants you to pull and copy the baylis murder book and bates-stamp all the copies.

21:11.350 --> 21:14.000
That's like 2,000 pages.

21:14.020 --> 21:15.900
I mean,are you kidding me?

21:15.930 --> 21:18.070
So when--when you say,"special job,"

21:18.090 --> 21:21.990
you mean "special" like as in special olympics or special bus?

21:22.030 --> 21:24.230
I mean,what is really goin' on here?

21:25.020 --> 21:25.710
Chief.

21:25.730 --> 21:27.950
I found the adoptive parents,the spenglers,

21:27.980 --> 21:30.100
who used kathy landis as a surrogate.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.590
What adoptive parents?
I can't tell you.

21:32.590 --> 21:35.530
Are you in the ladies' room,lieutenant provenza?

21:35.560 --> 21:38.650
Yeah. I found the adoptive parents.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.030
Wait for me--Outside.

21:48.090 --> 21:49.570
Sorry.

21:50.220 --> 21:52.600
Fritz,it's my investigation.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.990
I never thought i'd say this,

21:54.010 --> 21:58.480
but I need you to make a federal case out of it.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.840
We would never have chosen someone as unstable as kathy landis,

22:05.870 --> 22:08.830
i mean but we tried for years to have a baby.

22:08.830 --> 22:12.530
But after the sixth miscarriage...

22:13.390 --> 22:15.880
we decided to find a surrogate.

22:15.900 --> 22:16.830
Yeah,we checked around.

22:16.860 --> 22:21.420
The more established services were more than we could possibly afford.

22:21.510 --> 22:23.810
So you found an unlicensed broker.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.750
A total sleazebag attorney named allan roth.

22:26.790 --> 22:29.070
Big mistake.
We should have known.

22:29.090 --> 22:32.950
A woman like kathy landis was the only kind that'd have anything to do with him.

22:32.980 --> 22:35.370
But we were desperate.

22:35.410 --> 22:37.960
What kind of trouble is she in?

22:39.770 --> 22:43.020
It's my sad duty to tell you ms. Landis' body

22:43.040 --> 22:48.700
was discovered today under questionable circumstances.

22:52.480 --> 22:54.950
A-are you saying she was murdered?

22:56.880 --> 22:58.080
I'm sorry,

22:58.120 --> 23:00.420
but I'm not shocked.

23:00.450 --> 23:02.460
Are you?

23:02.580 --> 23:04.530
Honestly?

23:05.220 --> 23:07.290
You're not surprised?

23:07.970 --> 23:11.360
Kathy landis hung around with people like roth.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.520
Socialize with drug dealers and lowlifes,

23:15.560 --> 23:17.940
you might end up dead.

23:18.820 --> 23:23.280
When was the last time either of you spoke to or saw ms. Landis?

23:23.310 --> 23:27.240
Well,our daughter just turned 4,so that's how long.

23:27.290 --> 23:29.690
Did you have much contact during the pregnancy?

23:29.720 --> 23:31.600
At first,we would bring her food,

23:31.620 --> 23:34.630
stuff like that,but then roth kept us away.

23:34.650 --> 23:39.740
When emma was born underweight and with cocaine in her blood,

23:39.770 --> 23:40.990
we understood why.

23:41.020 --> 23:45.460
The doctors warned us emma might be developmentally delayed,

23:45.500 --> 23:47.650
but as you can see,she's a happy,

23:47.650 --> 23:49.920
healthy kid today.

23:49.940 --> 23:52.090
And have you dealt with mr. Roth since?

23:52.120 --> 23:53.610
Uh,well,actually,we--

23:53.630 --> 23:55.780
we thought about suing him at first.

23:55.790 --> 23:57.360
But we just had so much to deal with,

23:57.390 --> 24:00.470
and then we were just relieved to have him out of our lives.

24:00.490 --> 24:02.320
Spend 5 minutes with him.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.280
You'll understand.

24:20.430 --> 24:25.320
You get the feeling business isn't exactly booming for this guy?

24:32.210 --> 24:32.990
Uh,yeah?

24:33.010 --> 24:34.530
Allan roth?

24:35.400 --> 24:37.630
Deputy chief brenda leigh johnson of the L.A.P.D.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.780
This is lieutenant flynn.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.860
We've got a few questions we need to ask you.

24:40.900 --> 24:42.110
Yeah,sure. Of course.

24:42.140 --> 24:44.170
I'm--I'm just wrapping it up with a client.

24:44.190 --> 24:46.410
Can you give me one--one minute?

24:46.440 --> 24:48.080
We'll be right here.

24:56.850 --> 25:03.250
You know,it turns out the victim and her boyfriend had a business importing mexican folk crafts.

25:03.280 --> 25:07.750
Now,the total income over the past 3 years was about $40,000.

25:07.780 --> 25:11.540
Yet somehow they managed to buy a house in silver lake free and clear.

25:11.570 --> 25:14.880
I suppose a little supplemental drug income goes a long way.

25:14.900 --> 25:16.260
Yeah,no joke.

25:16.300 --> 25:20.160
I mean,this place is like state-of-the-art everything.

25:20.220 --> 25:22.320
There's no baby yet,

25:22.320 --> 25:26.540
but their kid's room is totally decked out and ready to go.

25:26.570 --> 25:28.060
Look at this.

25:28.090 --> 25:29.650
Toys.

25:29.830 --> 25:31.850
Giant dollhouse.

25:32.440 --> 25:33.580
Who are you calling?

25:33.620 --> 25:34.930
Mr. Roth.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.740
Every document on this table is privileged.

25:48.770 --> 25:52.080
Every document was privileged before you threw them away.

25:52.110 --> 25:53.800
I didn't throw 'em away.I dropped 'em.

25:53.810 --> 25:56.190
While evading arrest.Is that it?

25:56.210 --> 25:59.950
Did you throw them away or drop them while evading arrest?

26:02.340 --> 26:04.600
I threw 'em away.
That's what I thought.

26:04.630 --> 26:09.430
Now,I noticed that several of your babies went to oregon,washington,nevada.

26:09.460 --> 26:13.640
You do realize that you violated interstate adoption laws.

26:13.670 --> 26:17.060
Can we go back to evading arrest?
Absolutely not.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.800
I want a lawyer.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.190
Well,if I were you,I wouldn't think of speaking to the F.B.I.Without one.

26:22.450 --> 26:25.150
What--what do we gotta involve the F.B.I. For?

26:25.180 --> 26:27.070
I'm sure that we can come to some kind of agreement.

26:27.100 --> 26:29.780
I'm not interested in reaching an agreement,mr. Roth.

26:29.810 --> 26:34.040
I am only interested in finding kathy landis' killer.

26:35.110 --> 26:38.070
Somebody killed kathy landis?

26:38.130 --> 26:40.810
You know,that almost sounded convincing,mr. Roth.

26:40.840 --> 26:42.410
What do you think lieutenant flynn?

26:42.440 --> 26:46.980
I had no idea kathy landis was dead.Seriously.

26:46.980 --> 26:47.650
Oh,no. What?

26:47.680 --> 26:49.870
What,you think I had something to do with it?

26:49.890 --> 26:52.960
Tell me about the spengler pregnancy.

26:53.010 --> 26:54.940
Does--I--

26:54.990 --> 26:58.020
I don't--completely uneventful.

26:58.770 --> 27:00.850
kathy landis gave them a beautiful baby girl.

27:00.880 --> 27:05.190
I believe that baby was born underweight and tested positive for cocaine.

27:05.230 --> 27:06.610
Was it?

27:06.640 --> 27:09.700
I deal with so many couples.

27:11.180 --> 27:14.670
Aw,come on,look,I did everything I could to get kathy landis off drugs.

27:14.690 --> 27:15.560
Before next pregnancy,

27:15.590 --> 27:18.560
I even offered to loan her money so that she could go to rehab.

27:18.590 --> 27:19.330
She refused.

27:19.360 --> 27:21.780
You used kathy landis again after the spenglers?

27:21.810 --> 27:23.210
Yeah.

27:24.160 --> 27:24.940
It--yeah.

27:24.970 --> 27:26.860
And I paid for it,believe me.

27:26.890 --> 27:28.930
How was that?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.120
Baby was still born.

27:32.170 --> 27:34.010
It was tragic. It was.It was tragic.

27:34.050 --> 27:35.210
And the sansones--

27:35.250 --> 27:37.410
that's the other couple,they were furious.

27:37.450 --> 27:38.910
They demanded their money back.

27:38.940 --> 27:40.510
You think I got a dime from kathy landis?

27:40.530 --> 27:43.300
Hell,no. I'm still payin' 'em back.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.570
And how recently did you try to collect from her?

27:45.600 --> 27:48.160
Oh,I wrote kathy landis off 3 years ago.

27:48.180 --> 27:49.570
She's a total loose cannon.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.850
And you haven't spoken to her since?

27:51.920 --> 27:52.900
Uh,before you answer that,

27:52.930 --> 27:56.870
keep in mind I will access your phone records.

27:58.180 --> 28:00.990
She called me 2 weeks ago.

28:01.030 --> 28:02.990
She--she wanted to be a surrogate again.

28:03.030 --> 28:04.080
I told her get lost.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.000
You know what people look like when they're coked up?

28:06.030 --> 28:08.270
Her eyes were wide,and her teeth were grinding.That was her.

28:08.300 --> 28:09.970
You just said she called you.

28:09.990 --> 28:12.950
Are you now saying she came to see you?

28:14.050 --> 28:16.590
Right. Yes.She called me,

28:16.620 --> 28:19.920
and then she came to see me.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.140
What?!

28:21.180 --> 28:23.580
Mr. Roth,I have looked through all your paperwork,

28:23.620 --> 28:27.620
and I find nothing related to the spenglers and kathy landis.

28:27.650 --> 28:30.050
Yeah,well,you know,I might never have drawn up a contract.

28:30.090 --> 28:34.240
Sometimes,when I felt it was appropriate,I would do business on a handshake.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.190
Really?

28:35.210 --> 28:39.490
And have you ever shaken someone so hard you broke their neck?

28:45.890 --> 28:48.610
Let him stew,and we'll find this other couple the sansones,

28:48.610 --> 28:51.750
and where they were when kathy landis died.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.270
What's the point?

28:57.300 --> 29:00.560
Everything we've gotten so far is inadmissible in court.

29:00.590 --> 29:02.450
Once the F.B.I. Takes campbell into custody,

29:02.470 --> 29:04.410
I'll be able to legitimize everything.

29:04.430 --> 29:05.460
How the hell are you gonna do that?

29:05.470 --> 29:06.460
Coroner's preliminary notes,

29:06.480 --> 29:10.810
they confirmed our victim died 4 to 6 hours before robbery/homicide found her.

29:10.830 --> 29:12.960
Cause of death:A broken fifth cervical vertebra,

29:12.990 --> 29:14.350
which transected the spinal cord.

29:14.370 --> 29:15.750
And was she pregnant?

29:15.790 --> 29:16.690
Highly doubtful.

29:16.720 --> 29:19.600
The coroner says landis had a hysterectomy.

29:19.640 --> 29:20.810
Chief.
Yes.

29:20.810 --> 29:24.880
Commander taylor's been pushing discussions between prosecutors and campbell's lawyer.

29:24.910 --> 29:27.570
Word is they are very close to making a deal.

29:27.730 --> 29:29.770
If campbell makes a deal with prosecutors,

29:29.790 --> 29:31.110
he'll say where the body was found.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.410
Yeah,I understand that,detective sanchez.

29:33.450 --> 29:35.340
Has anyone heard from fritz?

29:35.360 --> 29:38.290
Uh,I mean,special agent howard?

29:39.040 --> 29:43.820
Then any suggestions on how we can delay a plea agreement being brokered on the sixth floor?

29:43.860 --> 29:45.750
Anything?

29:53.250 --> 29:55.940
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

29:56.910 --> 30:01.280
There comes a time in every man's life when he has to be willing to fall on his sword.

30:01.310 --> 30:04.230
Looks like,for me,that time is now.

30:04.340 --> 30:06.890
Hey,flynn,I'm resigning to save your ass.

30:06.910 --> 30:09.360
Would you hang up the phone?

30:09.510 --> 30:10.940
Asshole.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.790
Anyway,

30:12.880 --> 30:17.070
look,to everybody else here except flynn,

30:17.110 --> 30:18.620
I say--

30:24.950 --> 30:26.550
Bomb threat.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.190
Everybody out.

30:28.400 --> 30:29.970
Leave your things.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.300
It's a bomb threat.

30:47.490 --> 30:53.600
Stand clear of the building entrance till the search is complete.

30:57.440 --> 31:00.520
Please,step back and stand clear

31:00.580 --> 31:03.540
until I give you further instructions.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.710
Stand clear of the building entrance

31:07.740 --> 31:10.880
till the search is completed.

31:15.480 --> 31:16.260
Sorry I'm late.

31:16.290 --> 31:18.310
Ohh! Oh,thank god you're here.

31:18.340 --> 31:19.220
What did I miss?

31:19.250 --> 31:20.560
Uh,it's just a bomb threat.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.830
That's always a drag,huh?

31:21.870 --> 31:23.320
Not always.

31:26.060 --> 31:27.620
So,listen...

31:28.070 --> 31:29.920
I ran campbell.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.810
This guy's a player.He's way under the radar.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.550
His one outstanding warrant,

31:34.590 --> 31:38.870
from when el paso P.D. Caught him with 3 ounces of  meth and $4,000 in cash.

31:38.890 --> 31:41.760
Yeah. In other words,he's wanted for narcotics trafficking,

31:41.790 --> 31:43.400
conspiracy to commit money laundering,

31:43.420 --> 31:44.790
conspiracy to distribute...

31:44.810 --> 31:46.020
international drug trafficking.

31:46.040 --> 31:49.970
This is one very bad guy with serious ties to the gulf cartel.

31:49.990 --> 31:51.440
I'm takin' him.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.720
This is nonsense.

32:07.900 --> 32:09.340
Watch your head.

32:11.790 --> 32:14.490
Code 4. Code 4.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.260
All clear.

32:34.260 --> 32:38.080
I'm not answering any questions without my lawyer.

32:38.210 --> 32:41.760
Your deal with the L.A.P.D. Is behind you,mr. Campbell.

32:41.790 --> 32:43.580
You're in F.B.I. Custody now,

32:43.590 --> 32:45.070
and if you don't cooperate,

32:45.090 --> 32:50.010
special agent howard will have you thrown into prison as a drug snitch.

32:50.070 --> 32:52.410
Do we understand each other?

32:52.710 --> 32:53.720
Good.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.260
Now,I want you to know,

32:55.280 --> 32:56.930
before I ask you these questions,

32:56.950 --> 33:01.180
that I am strongly inclined to believe that you did not kill your girlfriend,

33:01.210 --> 33:06.090
and what you tell me now will greatly assist me in discovering who did.

33:06.130 --> 33:08.970
I'm gonna tape-record everything you say.

33:08.990 --> 33:12.040
Would you like to waive your right to an attorney?

33:12.230 --> 33:13.990
Yes.

33:14.860 --> 33:18.180
Where did you discover the body of katherine landis?

33:18.220 --> 33:21.900
In a garage,uh,this place kathy used to rent.

33:21.930 --> 33:24.200
And how did you get to the body?

33:24.220 --> 33:27.990
I kicked in the back door and dragged her out.

33:28.020 --> 33:31.700
And what did you do with the body?

33:40.350 --> 33:42.670
So what happens to scott campbell now?

33:42.710 --> 33:46.190
Well,he rats out his drug contacts to the F.B.I.,

33:46.230 --> 33:47.140
And then in a few years,

33:47.170 --> 33:51.230
he turns up in phoenix as the nice neighbor in the new house who never has to work.

33:51.280 --> 33:55.070
Ahem. I'd just like to say to everyone on behalf of flynn and myself

33:55.100 --> 33:57.170
how sorry we are for the things we put you through

33:57.200 --> 34:00.740
and how much we appreciate what you were willing to do for us.

34:00.770 --> 34:04.040
Lieutenant provenza,thank you so much for that apology.

34:04.220 --> 34:07.860
That was short,sweet,and entirely insufficient.

34:07.890 --> 34:10.130
Whoever killed katherine landis is still out there,

34:10.130 --> 34:13.969
and no one is looking for her murderer but us.

34:21.219 --> 34:25.020
So the victim's a former surrogate whose boyfriend cut her open for drugs.

34:25.050 --> 34:26.780
That's the big secret?

34:26.810 --> 34:28.449
Actually,no,it's not.

34:28.480 --> 34:30.820
Well,when do I find out?
Never.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.580
I need you to accept that you got to this place blindfolded,

34:33.580 --> 34:35.270
but from now on,you see everything.

34:35.300 --> 34:38.810
Well,do I at least get to know why you're not telling me?

34:38.840 --> 34:41.449
Sergeant,keeping you on the outside

34:41.469 --> 34:43.790
was a reflection of how vital you are to this squad.

34:43.810 --> 34:44.820
So why didn't you let me help?

34:44.850 --> 34:49.650
You did,as someone i knew I could count on when everything else fell apart.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.860
I have half a dozen of the others,

34:52.889 --> 34:56.310
but I have only got one of you.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.220
I told you already,

35:06.250 --> 35:08.410
kathy landis came to see me 2 weeks ago,

35:08.430 --> 35:10.050
because she wanted to be a surrogate again.

35:10.080 --> 35:16.520
Mr. Roth,the coroner has established that katherine landis was unable to bear children.

35:18.160 --> 35:19.260
Yes.

35:19.290 --> 35:20.890
No,I know--yes,I know that.

35:20.910 --> 35:22.080
No,she couldn't have kids.

35:22.110 --> 35:24.070
She--I--I mean,she--

35:24.100 --> 35:26.070
she didn't wanna be a surrogate again.

35:26.090 --> 35:29.190
What I meant is she wanted to use my surrogacy service.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.570
You know,she had straightened her life out,

35:30.600 --> 35:32.130
and--and she's--well,she wanted to--

35:32.150 --> 35:34.920
she wanted to have a baby of her own.

35:35.020 --> 35:37.970
I don't claim to be an expert on child rearing,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.880
mr. Roth,but I do know that you don't put an infant in a princess canopy bed.

35:41.910 --> 35:43.380
As you can see,

35:43.410 --> 35:46.680
katherine landis was preparing for the arrival of an older child.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.640
I'm guessing a 4-year-old girl.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.560
I don't know anything about that.

35:51.580 --> 35:52.990
We think you do.

35:53.020 --> 35:56.020
The F.B.I. Is on my speed dial,mr. Roth.

35:56.050 --> 35:58.690
We are so close,I'm practically in bed with them.

35:58.720 --> 36:02.170
Now,you can continue to lie about what happened between you and katherine landis,

36:02.200 --> 36:04.490
and I'll have you prosecuted for selling children,

36:04.520 --> 36:10.180
or you can be a cooperating witness and tell me why katherine landis really came to see you.

36:10.210 --> 36:13.740
Either way,the stork is dead.

36:20.260 --> 36:24.250
Thank you so much for agreeing to speak with us again.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.710
we just got a few loose ends to tie up.

36:28.820 --> 36:32.140
After an interview like the one we had yesterday,

36:32.160 --> 36:35.080
it is routine for us to do a basic background check.

36:35.110 --> 36:39.880
We look for prior arrests,reports of domestic disturbances,that kind of thing.

36:39.910 --> 36:40.710
A few weeks ago,

36:40.730 --> 36:43.950
a mrs. Hensley from next door called the police to say

36:43.970 --> 36:48.890
that there was a woman on your front lawn making threats.

36:48.890 --> 36:51.480
Well,that's the first I've heard of a police report.

36:51.510 --> 36:55.350
If the commotion was over by the time the officer drove by,

36:55.370 --> 36:57.850
I imagine he wouldn't have bothered you.

36:57.870 --> 37:01.050
I spent 3 hours with allan roth today,

37:01.080 --> 37:04.310
and he tried to conceal that 2 weeks ago,

37:04.340 --> 37:07.010
he'd given katherine landis your home address.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.430
That was a terrible violation of your confidentiality,

37:09.450 --> 37:11.990
and he will be punished,but

37:12.020 --> 37:18.140
am I correct in assuming that it was miss landis who was creating that disturbance out front?

37:20.550 --> 37:26.080
2 weeks ago,kathy landis appeared out of nowhere demanding to see emma.

37:26.110 --> 37:29.590
Craig argued with her.She left,and that was that.

37:29.620 --> 37:32.020
And yet the following day,

37:32.050 --> 37:35.400
you hired an attorney specializing in custody disputes,

37:35.430 --> 37:38.510
and last week a private investigator.

37:42.950 --> 37:51.330
This is a picture taken from a security camera at lax date- and time-stamped 9:25 A.M. Yesterday.

37:51.340 --> 37:54.310
Mr. Spengler,is that a picture of you...

37:54.740 --> 37:59.930
escorting kathy landis outside of the international terminal?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.550
Craig?

38:03.620 --> 38:07.930
I think it would be a good idea if you and your daughter went into another room,mrs. Spengler.

38:07.970 --> 38:11.640
Honey,I--
ellen,just do what they say.

38:12.470 --> 38:14.340
Come here,baby.

38:14.750 --> 38:18.200
Give me a hug,big hug.

38:19.710 --> 38:20.770
Ok.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.740
I wanna make this clear.

38:43.450 --> 38:47.350
My wife knows nothing about what happened yesterday.

38:47.570 --> 38:53.260
If you can convince me of that and I can convince the district attorney,

38:53.280 --> 38:57.420
perhaps he'll allow your wife to maintain custody of your daughter.

39:02.830 --> 39:06.030
Kathy landis said she wanted emma,

39:07.090 --> 39:10.550
said without a legal contract,she thought she'd get custody.

39:10.580 --> 39:15.310
She'd done her stint in rehab.

39:15.330 --> 39:19.450
My new lawyer thought that would give her a fighting chance.

39:21.090 --> 39:24.330
She's been smuggling heroin.

39:25.610 --> 39:26.850
My daughter's been through enough.

39:26.870 --> 39:32.460
I wasn't about to let her fall into the hands of a drug-dealing degenerate.

39:33.780 --> 39:39.520
Your private investigator told you when katherine landis would be returning from the drug run?

39:39.940 --> 39:41.430
Yes.

39:43.560 --> 39:48.540
I knew she wouldn't make a scene at the airport,not when she was carrying,

39:49.470 --> 39:51.280
so after I got her into my car,

39:51.310 --> 39:55.610
I offered her money if she would just disappear,get out of our lives.

39:55.630 --> 39:57.440
She laughed,said she didn't need any money,

39:57.470 --> 39:59.820
all she wanted was her child.

39:59.860 --> 40:02.270
Her child.

40:02.450 --> 40:05.300
But you had another option.

40:06.140 --> 40:10.780
Yes,and when she realized that I was taking her to the police...

40:13.330 --> 40:15.300
she went...

40:15.950 --> 40:17.890
crazy.

40:21.870 --> 40:24.760
Things got out of hand.

40:25.870 --> 40:28.500
I didn't mean to hurt her.

40:29.080 --> 40:31.440
But you killed her,

40:31.490 --> 40:35.320
and you dumped her body off sepulveda boulevard.

40:35.440 --> 40:38.550
Sepulveda? No.

40:39.050 --> 40:39.850
I was panicked.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.810
I didn't know what the hell i was going to do,

40:41.850 --> 40:47.010
and then I remembered that I actually still have a key to the,

40:47.050 --> 40:50.110
place she was staying when she was pregnant,so I--

40:50.130 --> 40:52.290
I thought that if I left here there,

40:52.310 --> 40:56.640
maybe that would be the end of it,

40:56.670 --> 41:00.660
maybe we could just go on with our lives.

41:06.110 --> 41:10.980
I'll give you 5 hours to turn yourself in on charges of manslaughter.

41:11.800 --> 41:14.220
This is a warrant.

41:14.830 --> 41:17.500
It lists everything that you and your lawyer will need

41:17.530 --> 41:21.420
when you sit down with me and the district attorney later on this afternoon--

41:21.560 --> 41:24.620
baby documents and canceled checks.

41:24.650 --> 41:29.030
And if you would please bring that key to the garage.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.320
I assume that you're a good father,

41:32.360 --> 41:34.610
mr. Spengler,and a decent human being.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.730
That said,if you try and run,

41:36.760 --> 41:41.390
I will make certain that you are charged with first-degree murder and your wife as an accessory.

41:41.420 --> 41:43.920
Do I make myself clear?

41:50.100 --> 41:52.360
All of this...

41:52.430 --> 41:57.230
it was just because i want to keep my daughter safe.

41:57.790 --> 42:00.440
You were protecting your own.

42:01.080 --> 42:03.760
I can understand that.

42:20.420 --> 42:21.680
Thank you.

42:23.940 --> 42:26.360
Well,I have,uh,spoken to the D.A.,

42:26.390 --> 42:31.840
And spengler's plea to manslaughter won't reveal where he disposed of the body.

42:31.870 --> 42:33.260
Then we're out of the woods.

42:33.290 --> 42:34.900
No. No,no,no.

42:34.940 --> 42:41.740
There is still one piece of potentially incriminating evidence floating around.

42:49.300 --> 42:53.360
Ok,look,chief,I just want you to know this kind of thing it'll never happen again.

42:53.400 --> 42:55.230
Oh,I know that,lieutenant

42:55.250 --> 42:57.340
Just like I know that under most circumstances,

42:57.370 --> 43:02.400
you two are conscientious and disciplined and...

43:02.780 --> 43:04.360
generous.

43:07.940 --> 43:09.200
Malloy's?

43:09.230 --> 43:11.570
That's where you're taking the squad for dinner.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.710
A case of mccrae ridge 1997?

43:14.760 --> 43:17.260
My favorite merlot.

43:17.430 --> 43:21.480
Though in a pinch,I'll take beringer howell.

43:22.390 --> 43:25.850
Sergeant gabriel likes his suits from fred segal.

43:25.890 --> 43:29.310
Daniels loves opium,the perfume,of course.

43:29.350 --> 43:31.020
3 bottles should be plenty.

43:31.060 --> 43:34.420
Detective sanchez wants a 47-inch flat-screen tv,

43:34.460 --> 43:41.510
and lieutenant tao's son has just been begging him for something called a macbook pro.

43:41.540 --> 43:45.780
You can ask tao how many giga-whatevers to buy.

43:46.590 --> 43:48.320
What isn't on this list?

43:48.350 --> 43:51.380
Oh,I'm so glad you asked.

43:51.400 --> 43:53.290
Thoughtful.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.970
The mets are playing the dodgers next month,

43:56.000 --> 44:01.890
and agent howard,who truly went above and beyond the call of duty,would just love a pair of...

44:01.930 --> 44:06.240
skybox tickets.
