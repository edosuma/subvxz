WEBVTT

00:04.778 --> 00:06.237
Good morning.

00:06.238 --> 00:08.607
Let's wake up and start the day.

00:08.608 --> 00:11.277
Now, first things first, make sure

00:11.278 --> 00:13.500
that you're making healthy
decisions for yourself.

00:13.525 --> 00:16.027
And today, I'll be showing
you how to make

00:16.027 --> 00:19.317
my favorite morning wake-up smoothie.

00:19.318 --> 00:20.688
Let's do this.

00:23.238 --> 00:26.397
Now, remember to get
45 minutes of exercise.

00:26.398 --> 00:29.277
And, you know, switch it up,
so that you don't get bored.

00:29.278 --> 00:33.067
Think carefully about what
you want to achieve today.

00:35.188 --> 00:39.687
Then open your arms and
get ready to greet the day.

00:39.688 --> 00:41.929
And after this nutritious breakfast

00:41.954 --> 00:43.777
and that intense workout,

00:43.778 --> 00:46.437
you'll be ready for any obstacle

00:46.462 --> 00:47.646
that comes your way.

00:49.392 --> 00:51.067
Time to wake up.

00:54.358 --> 00:57.737
My gosh, it's so good.

01:00.688 --> 01:03.107
Bella Colen Brands
would like to express

01:03.108 --> 01:06.027
our condolences to the
family of Olivia Brooks.

01:06.028 --> 01:08.187
But I cannot let these
charges against my company...

01:08.188 --> 01:09.397
My name is George Brooks.

01:09.398 --> 01:11.977
And I'm here today to let
you know that Isabella Colen

01:11.978 --> 01:14.647
and her lifestyle company
are 100% culpable

01:14.648 --> 01:16.107
for my wife Olivia's death.

01:16.108 --> 01:17.737
And we'll prove that in court.

01:17.738 --> 01:20.233
Their irresponsible business
practices killed my wife

01:20.258 --> 01:22.543
and other people across the country...

01:22.568 --> 01:25.647
We are absolutely not culpable
for Mrs. Brooks' death.

01:31.478 --> 01:33.527
When was the last

01:33.528 --> 01:36.477
time you bought me a $47 glass of scotch?

01:36.478 --> 01:37.608
I don't remember.

01:37.609 --> 01:38.737
Never.

01:38.738 --> 01:41.726
You have never done that.

01:41.751 --> 01:43.857
Especially before meeting a client.

01:43.858 --> 01:45.147
What, are you nervous, too?

01:45.148 --> 01:46.935
I knew it.

01:46.960 --> 01:48.647
It's like you're gearing up to ask me

01:48.648 --> 01:50.567
to take my daughter to the prom.

01:50.568 --> 01:52.477
Well, you don't have a daughter.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.398
You do have a sister.

01:55.938 --> 01:57.437
No.

01:57.462 --> 02:01.012
No, no, no, no, no, no, no way.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.857
Come on, you...

02:02.858 --> 02:05.107
you really want to
represent your ex-wife?

02:05.108 --> 02:07.357
I want to represent your sister.

02:07.358 --> 02:09.026
Her lawyer called.

02:09.027 --> 02:10.937
And they need us... She's being sued.

02:10.937 --> 02:13.110
For gross negligence, wrongful death.

02:13.135 --> 02:15.777
And the plaintiffs hired a top firm...

02:15.778 --> 02:17.357
suing her for 60 million,

02:17.358 --> 02:18.777
punitive damages.

02:18.778 --> 02:20.897
That's gonna bankrupt Izzy.

02:20.898 --> 02:22.277
It'll destroy her.

02:22.278 --> 02:25.317
Y-You know that she
hasn't really spoken to me

02:25.318 --> 02:26.607
in three years?

02:26.608 --> 02:28.527
Well, you did turn down her job offer.

02:28.528 --> 02:30.317
Three years without talking to someone

02:30.318 --> 02:31.687
you were very close to.

02:31.688 --> 02:32.976
Living in the same city

02:33.001 --> 02:35.765
means it's more than just
you turning down a job.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.277
Bull, come on, don't...

02:37.278 --> 02:38.559
don't do this.

02:38.584 --> 02:40.487
Don't use this trial to try to fix us.

02:40.488 --> 02:43.277
There are ten other firms out
there that she could hire.

02:43.278 --> 02:45.879
None of them are as good as us,
and you know that.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.698
We're taking this case, Benny.

02:47.723 --> 02:49.237
Relax.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.778
Today we're just meeting the lawyer.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:05.538 --> 03:06.867
Just a lawyer?

03:06.868 --> 03:08.947
Supposed to be.

03:12.198 --> 03:14.777
Ha-ha, Izzy.

03:14.778 --> 03:15.908
How are you, sis?

03:15.909 --> 03:17.037
Benny.

03:17.038 --> 03:18.827
Punctual as always and

03:18.828 --> 03:21.037
full of surprises, as always.

03:21.932 --> 03:24.786
It's been too long, boys.

03:24.811 --> 03:26.086
Yeah.

03:26.111 --> 03:27.827
So...

03:27.828 --> 03:29.277
what happened to your lawyer?

03:29.278 --> 03:30.697
You really thought I
would let someone else

03:30.698 --> 03:32.197
handle our first meeting?

03:32.198 --> 03:33.577
Hell of a situation you've gotten

03:33.578 --> 03:34.577
yourself into.

03:34.578 --> 03:36.237
Thank you for the sympathy,

03:36.238 --> 03:38.709
but there's zero chance
it was my company's fault.

03:38.734 --> 03:40.365
We have the strictest safety standards.

03:40.390 --> 03:42.407
Nothing gets by me.

03:42.408 --> 03:43.617
That I believe.

03:50.683 --> 03:53.407
Olivia's death presented
as a heart attack,

03:53.408 --> 03:56.277
so her husband George didn't
suspect any foul play.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.237
But then, when the autopsy came back

03:58.238 --> 04:00.327
a week later saying that she'd actually

04:00.328 --> 04:01.908
died of anaphylactic shock

04:01.933 --> 04:03.487
from exposure to bee pollen.

04:03.488 --> 04:05.736
Olivia and George knew about her allergy.

04:05.761 --> 04:08.577
They avoided anything
with that ingredient.

04:08.578 --> 04:10.987
They kept the house clean.
No traces were found anywhere.

04:10.988 --> 04:12.367
Except in the Bella Colón smoothie.

04:12.368 --> 04:13.505
There was some left over,

04:13.530 --> 04:15.327
and it came back positive for bee pollen.

04:15.328 --> 04:16.849
George's lawyers are arguing

04:16.874 --> 04:19.327
that some of it found its
way into the Bella powder

04:19.327 --> 04:20.817
during its processing.

04:20.843 --> 04:23.828
- And since it's a civil case...
- They don't need reasonable doubt.

04:23.831 --> 04:26.867
They just need five out of the six jurors

04:26.868 --> 04:30.867
to agree that it's likely the
pollen came from the powder.

04:30.868 --> 04:31.907
What about the other packets?

04:31.908 --> 04:33.571
In a landfill somewhere.

04:33.596 --> 04:35.367
We need an alternative theory

04:35.368 --> 04:36.673
about where that pollen came from.

04:36.697 --> 04:38.237
Well, I'll deep dive into Olivia.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.117
And I will interview our client's suppliers

04:40.118 --> 04:41.277
and employees.

04:41.278 --> 04:43.618
And should I call her "Izzy"?

04:45.328 --> 04:47.327
Okay.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.117
Would you all like to ask

04:49.118 --> 04:50.867
the question you are dying to ask?

04:50.868 --> 04:52.608
Isabella Colen... She's your ex-wife.

04:52.633 --> 04:54.237
We just want to make sure that you're

04:54.262 --> 04:56.076
- okay with this.
- Are you okay?

04:56.077 --> 04:57.577
She was my wife for two years.

04:57.578 --> 04:59.197
She is now our client.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.987
More importantly, she's Benny's sister.

05:00.988 --> 05:02.157
And they're not exactly

05:02.158 --> 05:03.560
getting along right now.

05:03.585 --> 05:05.777
So we are gonna do
everything in our power

05:05.778 --> 05:07.327
to help them.

05:07.328 --> 05:09.657
Get it? Good.

05:09.658 --> 05:11.037
This is professional.

05:11.038 --> 05:12.368
Okay?

05:14.238 --> 05:15.977
How much of that was genuine,

05:15.978 --> 05:17.977
and how much of that
was straight-up denial?

05:17.978 --> 05:20.317
I don't think they're mutually exclusive.

05:20.318 --> 05:21.398
Yikes.

05:21.399 --> 05:22.477
Awkward.

05:22.478 --> 05:24.607
She's a celebrity. The one who tells you

05:24.608 --> 05:26.397
that by making your bed in the morning,

05:26.398 --> 05:27.857
it will somehow make your day better.

05:27.858 --> 05:30.567
Now, personally,
I never made my bed as a kid.

05:30.568 --> 05:31.817
It's true.

05:31.818 --> 05:33.817
He's been waiting 30
years to get that dig in.

05:33.818 --> 05:36.857
It's not a dig,
and we can't ignore your fame.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.977
It is going to have a significant impact

05:38.978 --> 05:40.027
on the jury.

05:40.028 --> 05:41.777
In a good or bad way?

05:41.778 --> 05:42.937
Depends on the juror.

05:42.938 --> 05:44.644
And that is what we're here to find out.

05:44.669 --> 05:47.187
Well, these people seem to like me.

05:48.818 --> 05:51.441
There's my team.

05:51.466 --> 05:53.107
Dr. Bull, you know Christopher Franklin,

05:53.108 --> 05:55.567
lead outside counsel
for Bella Colón Brands,

05:55.568 --> 05:58.027
and my attorney in this case.

06:01.068 --> 06:03.777
This is my brother, Benny.

06:03.778 --> 06:04.937
Hi.

06:04.938 --> 06:06.147
He's a lawyer, too.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.527
Well, no, actually,
he was a lawyer, and now he's a...

06:08.528 --> 06:09.977
a mock-lawyer?

06:09.978 --> 06:12.737
Okay, Isabella, always the older sister.

06:12.738 --> 06:15.067
Benny's tried hundreds of cases.

06:15.068 --> 06:17.607
How familiar are you with trial science?

06:17.608 --> 06:19.687
Very. I knew we needed every tool

06:19.688 --> 06:20.937
in the arsenal for this case,

06:20.938 --> 06:23.737
so I advised Isabella
to put the past aside

06:23.738 --> 06:25.317
and let me call you up.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.187
Good advice to us all.

06:27.188 --> 06:29.237
Sorry, our distributor in Wisconsin

06:29.238 --> 06:31.317
was trying to raise the price per unit

06:31.318 --> 06:32.607
on our line of yoga gear.

06:32.608 --> 06:34.438
And I bet you didn't let him.

06:34.441 --> 06:36.777
You remember Alison, my C.O.O.?

06:36.778 --> 06:38.317
Of course. Good to see you.

06:38.318 --> 06:40.357
Hardest-working person I'd ever met,

06:40.358 --> 06:42.277
and I see you still hold the title.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.397
You know what we say at Bella,

06:43.398 --> 06:44.607
"Busy with what I love."

06:46.358 --> 06:47.941
Well, we'll be putting you on the stand

06:47.966 --> 06:50.187
to walk the jury through
safety protocols,

06:50.188 --> 06:51.647
and as Izzy's friend,

06:51.648 --> 06:54.108
you will be her character witness.

06:55.898 --> 06:58.107
Of course. Franklin says that

06:58.108 --> 07:00.107
is a "lose the company" case?

07:00.108 --> 07:01.938
Only if the other side wins.

07:04.938 --> 07:07.277
Boy, what's that smell?

07:07.278 --> 07:09.187
Eucalyptus. Cable asked for some advice

07:09.188 --> 07:11.237
for her back pain, so I set up a few

07:11.238 --> 07:12.647
essential-oil diffusers.

07:12.648 --> 07:14.147
On an unrelated matter,

07:14.148 --> 07:16.187
remind me to fire Cable later.

07:16.188 --> 07:18.187
I can't believe you still
live in your office.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.237
Funny story...

07:19.238 --> 07:20.817
I had a bed and a home,

07:20.818 --> 07:22.147
but two and a half years ago,

07:22.148 --> 07:23.607
a bunch of lawyers came
and gave them to you.

07:23.608 --> 07:25.375
Funny story, when we were married,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.067
you often slept in the office.

07:27.068 --> 07:28.647
Only when I had a case.

07:28.648 --> 07:29.897
I'm just saying

07:29.898 --> 07:31.477
I think it's your choice.

07:31.478 --> 07:32.737
I love what I do,

07:32.738 --> 07:34.237
and I love not having
to justify it to anyone.

07:34.238 --> 07:35.527
And can you please stop

07:35.528 --> 07:37.897
with the folding of the, because...

07:37.898 --> 07:39.277
It's fine.

07:39.278 --> 07:40.607
I'm sorry.

07:40.608 --> 07:43.027
You didn't come here to
fix my office ambience,

07:43.028 --> 07:44.147
and certainly not here to fix me.

07:44.148 --> 07:45.317
I'm here to help you.

07:45.318 --> 07:47.107
Right? So...

07:47.108 --> 07:48.107
how are you handling this?

07:48.108 --> 07:49.423
I'm fine.

07:49.424 --> 07:50.737
You're not fine.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.277
You've been tapping your finger against

07:52.278 --> 07:53.463
your leg like a crazy person.

07:53.488 --> 07:54.973
All right, you see,

07:54.998 --> 07:56.647
this is exactly what I don't need.

07:56.648 --> 07:59.437
I don't need psychoanalysis,
I need trial science.

07:59.438 --> 08:00.567
You know, I may be innocent,

08:00.568 --> 08:02.317
but I've heard you say often enough that

08:02.318 --> 08:04.937
the facts don't matter,
it's how the jurors see you, so...

08:04.938 --> 08:06.937
Um, about that...

08:06.938 --> 08:09.148
There's something you should see.

08:11.818 --> 08:13.277
Our most recent mock jury.

08:13.278 --> 08:14.817
I'm a big fan of Isabella's.

08:14.818 --> 08:17.397
Her lemon cake is my
go-to choice for potlucks.

08:17.398 --> 08:18.477
It's always a hit.

08:18.478 --> 08:19.777
And she's so put-together.

08:19.778 --> 08:21.567
I wish I could pull off her look.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.817
She's totally flawless.

08:23.818 --> 08:25.188
What exactly is the problem?

08:26.568 --> 08:28.287
- Liable.
- Liable.

08:28.312 --> 08:29.989
She's definitely guilty.

08:30.014 --> 08:31.403
I mean "liable."

08:31.428 --> 08:33.067
Okay, that doesn't make sense.

08:33.068 --> 08:34.067
They're not judging the case.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.187
They're judging you.

08:35.188 --> 08:36.187
But they just said

08:36.188 --> 08:37.647
that they were fans of mine.

08:37.648 --> 08:40.477
They feel like Isabella
sets an impossible standard.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.277
So even while they praise

08:42.278 --> 08:43.578
her products and advice,

08:43.604 --> 08:45.970
they seem to hate her
for being too perfect.

08:45.995 --> 08:48.277
People can't take having
two conflicting feelings.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.237
It's cognitive dissonance,
so they have to settle on one.

08:51.238 --> 08:53.397
If they declare Izzy liable,

08:53.398 --> 08:55.390
it makes her seem less perfect.

08:55.415 --> 08:57.237
Is it like this across the board?

08:57.238 --> 08:59.237
Think of it like a love/hate relationship.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.737
You eventually settle on hate,

09:00.738 --> 09:03.093
because you can't take
feeling so much affection

09:03.118 --> 09:04.357
for someone you can't stand.

09:04.358 --> 09:06.647
Are we still talking about the jury?

09:06.648 --> 09:08.188
People love to hate you.

09:24.278 --> 09:26.107
Well, this is a first for me.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.317
I've never seen a jury have
a love/hate relationship

09:28.318 --> 09:29.687
with a client.

09:29.688 --> 09:31.237
Well, how do we change that?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.357
What do we have to do?

09:32.358 --> 09:34.027
Give the people what they want.

09:34.028 --> 09:36.877
We're gonna take you down a notch,
so they won't have to.

09:36.902 --> 09:39.619
First, physically, with Chunk,
and then emotionally,

09:39.644 --> 09:42.167
we're gonna muddy you up,
show your vulnerability.

09:42.168 --> 09:44.417
Isabella's image is her brand.

09:44.418 --> 09:45.688
It's aspirational.

09:45.713 --> 09:46.917
It inspires a better life.

09:46.918 --> 09:48.167
If we make her look bad, then...

09:48.168 --> 09:49.837
Not bad...

09:49.862 --> 09:51.127
- just human.
- Look,

09:51.128 --> 09:52.457
you either trust his strategy

09:52.458 --> 09:54.248
or there's no point in hiring us.

09:55.338 --> 09:56.497
If you want,

09:56.498 --> 09:57.577
we can sit this one out and help you

09:57.578 --> 09:59.207
with the bankruptcy proceedings.

09:59.208 --> 10:02.127
You'll get the family
discount for that one.

10:02.128 --> 10:04.838
Okay. I get it.

10:05.885 --> 10:07.167
But it must be rough, though.

10:07.168 --> 10:09.167
I'm one of six, and sure,

10:09.168 --> 10:10.377
we drive each other crazy,

10:10.378 --> 10:11.957
but we're tight.

10:11.958 --> 10:14.498
If I only had one sibling
and we weren't talking...

10:14.523 --> 10:16.957
Aren't we here to try on clothes?

10:16.958 --> 10:18.917
I'm full service. I can dress you up

10:18.918 --> 10:20.627
and talk family dynamics.

10:20.628 --> 10:23.287
Well, let's just stick to the clothes.

10:23.288 --> 10:25.837
Except not those.

10:25.838 --> 10:27.037
But that's the whole point.

10:27.038 --> 10:28.787
Bull wants you more approachable.

10:28.788 --> 10:30.707
Would you approach me in this?

10:30.708 --> 10:31.780
Look, I get it.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.167
I-I read your blog.

10:33.168 --> 10:34.287
I know it sounds frivolous,

10:34.288 --> 10:35.877
but so many people,

10:35.878 --> 10:37.707
they walk around wearing uniforms,

10:37.708 --> 10:40.167
and aren't able to express who they are,

10:40.168 --> 10:43.037
because they're scared or they
just don't have the confidence.

10:43.038 --> 10:44.787
You give them self-esteem.

10:44.788 --> 10:46.627
Thank you.

10:46.628 --> 10:48.288
You still have to try these on.

10:50.878 --> 10:52.377
First look.

10:52.378 --> 10:54.377
What? She'd never wear that.

10:54.378 --> 10:55.627
Who is she trying to be?

10:55.628 --> 10:57.417
Is she, like, mocking regular people

10:57.418 --> 10:58.337
with that outfit?

10:58.338 --> 10:59.667
No.

10:59.668 --> 11:02.207
No. No, of course not.
How about this one?

11:02.208 --> 11:04.917
Now that's Isabella Colón.

11:04.918 --> 11:06.877
I wonder how much plastic
surgery it would take

11:06.878 --> 11:08.207
to make me look like that.

11:08.208 --> 11:09.457
Chunk!

11:09.458 --> 11:12.373
Guys, excuse me for just a second, okay?

11:13.958 --> 11:15.458
See if this helps.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.127
Are you sure about this?

11:20.152 --> 11:21.418
Give it a try.

11:22.418 --> 11:24.881
How about this one?

11:24.906 --> 11:26.337
She looks different.

11:26.338 --> 11:28.037
Well, how do you feel about it?

11:28.038 --> 11:29.247
I like it.

11:29.248 --> 11:30.838
- I mean, she looks comfortable.
- Yeah.

11:30.841 --> 11:32.417
Much more chill.

11:32.418 --> 11:33.417
I'm a fan.

11:33.418 --> 11:34.917
All right.

11:34.918 --> 11:36.247
You look the same.

11:36.248 --> 11:38.247
Okay, what did he do?

11:38.248 --> 11:39.417
It's what we didn't do.

11:39.418 --> 11:40.837
Makeup... barely any of it.

11:40.838 --> 11:44.337
Creates the ineffable
feeling of accessibility,

11:44.338 --> 11:45.747
particularly among strangers.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.575
And she's beautiful
enough to carry it off.

11:47.600 --> 11:48.747
All right, noted.

11:48.772 --> 11:50.309
No makeup in court for Izzy.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.536
Let's get down to voir dire.

11:51.561 --> 11:53.877
I have a questionnaire prepared.

11:53.878 --> 11:57.337
It's standard for defendants
with a large media presence.

11:57.338 --> 12:00.997
It'll identify who on the jury
likes Isabella and who doesn't.

12:00.998 --> 12:03.207
Well, finding people who
like Izzy isn't enough.

12:03.208 --> 12:06.167
Our whole problem is with
the love/hate dynamic.

12:06.168 --> 12:07.877
People will say they like Izzy,

12:07.878 --> 12:09.287
but then they'll hold her liable.

12:09.288 --> 12:10.707
Who do we target?

12:10.708 --> 12:11.877
For those who've never

12:11.878 --> 12:13.457
heard of her, we want to find the people

12:13.458 --> 12:14.651
who aren't quick to blame.

12:14.676 --> 12:16.537
And for those who do know who she is,

12:16.538 --> 12:18.337
we want to root out the perfectionists.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.337
Like I said, they'll say they like Izzy...

12:20.338 --> 12:22.497
But they'll secretly
resent her for holding them

12:22.498 --> 12:24.417
to a standard that they can't meet.

12:24.418 --> 12:26.537
How much are you enjoying this?

12:26.538 --> 12:27.958
More than I should be.

12:30.392 --> 12:33.127
Of course I know who she is.

12:33.128 --> 12:36.127
I make her gilded fruit
centerpiece every Thanksgiving.

12:36.128 --> 12:37.337
How do Sara's centerpieces look?

12:37.338 --> 12:38.497
Well, she's not

12:38.498 --> 12:40.417
exactly the da Vinci of tablescaping.

12:40.418 --> 12:42.627
More like the Tower of Pisa.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.337
So she can't

12:44.338 --> 12:45.917
meet Izzy's standards.

12:45.918 --> 12:47.917
Great, so she secretly hates me?

12:47.918 --> 12:49.627
No, not necessarily.

12:49.628 --> 12:51.417
Depends on the captions.

12:56.078 --> 12:57.667
They're hilarious.

12:57.668 --> 12:59.247
Acceptable, Your Honor.

12:59.248 --> 13:01.247
Wait, what just happened?

13:01.248 --> 13:03.247
We move fast. Keep up.

13:03.248 --> 13:04.957
Sara can joke about her failures.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.707
She's not a perfectionist, so...

13:06.708 --> 13:08.957
she's not likely to resent
your perfection.

13:08.958 --> 13:10.887
You've never even heard her name?

13:10.912 --> 13:11.871
I don't know.

13:11.896 --> 13:13.537
Has she ever been on ESPN?

13:13.538 --> 13:14.627
Have you?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.457
Missed opportunity.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.957
You could help linebackers
with dinner parties

13:18.958 --> 13:20.628
- during the off-season.
- Carlos, have you

13:20.631 --> 13:22.294
ever tried online dating?

13:22.319 --> 13:24.137
Sure. In this city, who hasn't?

13:24.138 --> 13:25.507
And how did those dates go for you?

13:25.508 --> 13:27.257
Honestly, not great.

13:27.258 --> 13:28.677
I guess I haven't clicked
with anyone yet.

13:28.678 --> 13:30.928
But that's just blind luck, right?

13:31.762 --> 13:33.297
Acceptable to the defense, Your Honor.

13:33.298 --> 13:34.797
Boom.

13:34.798 --> 13:36.177
You may continue, Counselor.

13:36.178 --> 13:38.717
I suppose you have an
explanation for that selection.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.337
Or you want to date Carlos.

13:40.338 --> 13:41.467
I could do worse.

13:41.468 --> 13:42.717
He's not a blamer,

13:42.718 --> 13:44.467
so he doesn't hold the dating sites

13:44.468 --> 13:46.217
accountable when he strikes out.

13:46.218 --> 13:48.297
So he'll be less likely to blame you

13:48.298 --> 13:50.547
for Olivia's accidental death.

13:50.548 --> 13:51.825
Don't know her, sorry.

13:51.850 --> 13:53.757
With three kids under ten,
the only celebrity

13:53.758 --> 13:56.377
I see regularly is Dora the Explorer.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.507
Leslie's up. She's never heard of Izzy.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.427
She might be right for our last slot.

14:00.428 --> 14:01.587
Okay.

14:01.588 --> 14:03.877
High school principal, divorced.

14:03.878 --> 14:06.297
But it was amicable. The court records

14:06.298 --> 14:07.967
indicate they used mediation.

14:07.968 --> 14:10.377
So she's not inclined to place blame

14:10.378 --> 14:11.877
unnecessarily... That's good.

14:11.878 --> 14:13.337
And yet,

14:13.338 --> 14:15.257
you two notice anything funny about her?

14:15.258 --> 14:16.507
Yeah.

14:16.508 --> 14:17.877
Are those my...?

14:17.878 --> 14:19.217
Peacock feather earrings.

14:19.218 --> 14:21.602
She followed your step-by-step video.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.444
She lied about being a fan of mine?

14:23.469 --> 14:25.137
She wanted in on the jury,

14:25.138 --> 14:28.007
but thought she'd get struck if
she admitted to knowing you.

14:28.008 --> 14:30.067
Problem is we can't trust her.

14:30.092 --> 14:31.297
We don't know what her motives are.

14:31.298 --> 14:32.337
Yeah.

14:32.338 --> 14:34.427
Acceptable to the defense.

14:34.428 --> 14:35.678
No. Um, Franklin...

14:37.218 --> 14:38.337
That should do it.

14:38.338 --> 14:40.837
Thank you, everyone, for your time.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.467
Looks like we've got our jury.

14:42.468 --> 14:44.467
I'm going to read everyone...

14:44.468 --> 14:45.507
What's the issue?

14:45.508 --> 14:47.007
She fit all the criteria you gave me.

14:47.008 --> 14:48.467
- Marissa.
- Right here, Bull.

14:48.468 --> 14:51.047
Have Cable and Danny focus on Leslie.

14:51.048 --> 14:54.257
The secret fan and possible
perfectionist could be trouble.

14:54.258 --> 14:57.337
Certain kind of value
system for you and each one...

14:57.338 --> 14:59.087
Do you have a sec?

14:59.088 --> 15:02.297
Hey. You know, in the future,

15:02.298 --> 15:04.797
we're gonna have implants in our
heads, so you won't have to

15:04.798 --> 15:06.927
hold that thing up to your ear.

15:06.928 --> 15:08.047
It's usually not this bad.

15:08.048 --> 15:10.427
Just right now, our capital is low, so...

15:10.428 --> 15:12.217
Izzy is 24/7, right?

15:12.218 --> 15:14.467
Trust me, I understand.

15:14.468 --> 15:17.297
If you want to talk about it,
I'm here, okay?

15:17.298 --> 15:18.338
Okay.

15:19.798 --> 15:21.967
Hey, Bull?

15:21.968 --> 15:25.094
Hey, how are the
company interviews going?

15:25.119 --> 15:27.837
Well, Alison is a tireless worker,
a loyal number two,

15:27.838 --> 15:30.047
and would die for Isabella.

15:30.048 --> 15:32.047
Look into her correspondence.

15:32.048 --> 15:33.028
Let's focus on Alison.

15:33.029 --> 15:34.007
You got it.

15:34.008 --> 15:36.837
God, that was rough.
I'm really starving.

15:36.838 --> 15:38.967
Well, you know, it's downtown.
There's plenty of places

15:38.968 --> 15:41.088
- you can get yourself something to eat.
- What about that Puerto Rican.

15:41.089 --> 15:42.929
Place in the East Village
for dinner, remember?

15:43.574 --> 15:44.467
We can go there

15:44.468 --> 15:46.378
and discuss the jury results.

15:47.298 --> 15:50.047
I should get back to trial prep.

15:50.048 --> 15:51.524
I'm still tweaking the opening remarks.

15:51.548 --> 15:53.298
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

15:54.338 --> 15:56.338
But thanks for the offer.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.336
Hey.

16:00.361 --> 16:01.967
I know this rooftop place.

16:01.968 --> 16:03.137
Well, I haven't been there in a while,

16:03.138 --> 16:04.677
but they serve cheap beer.

16:12.638 --> 16:16.757
Izzy, I forgot how much I love your roof.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.177
I know.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.877
I was just thinking about...

16:19.878 --> 16:23.507
Do you remember when Benny
confronted me up here?

16:27.178 --> 16:28.377
If you recall,

16:28.378 --> 16:29.467
I was just chilling.

16:29.468 --> 16:31.137
I had a little cozy blanket,

16:31.138 --> 16:32.445
nice bottle of wine.

16:32.470 --> 16:34.523
Yeah, no. He cracked it
open and he asked you

16:34.548 --> 16:35.937
what your intentions were with me.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.602
And then, he finished the bottle of wine.

16:39.718 --> 16:42.007
You guys were so close.

16:42.008 --> 16:43.507
Big sister.

16:43.508 --> 16:45.507
He wanted to follow in your footsteps.

16:45.508 --> 16:47.757
You guys cared so much
about each other, and...

16:47.758 --> 16:49.757
Must be hard

16:49.758 --> 16:51.138
- to have lost that.
- Don't.

16:52.628 --> 16:54.667
I'm just saying, I know how important

16:54.668 --> 16:56.037
family is to both of you.

16:56.038 --> 16:57.707
Well, work is my family.

16:57.708 --> 16:59.077
I have Alison

16:59.078 --> 17:00.058
and Franklin.

17:00.059 --> 17:01.037
Franklin.

17:01.038 --> 17:02.837
Give me a break.

17:02.838 --> 17:04.666
Franklin's nice,
but he's in it for the money.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.247
And Alison is so overworked.

17:06.248 --> 17:08.497
I mean, looks like she
hasn't slept in a month.

17:08.498 --> 17:10.377
I think she may be hiding something, too.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.747
Okay, stop it.

17:11.748 --> 17:12.925
I trust Alison.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.127
She's not just my C.O.O.

17:14.127 --> 17:16.207
She's also my closest friend.

17:16.208 --> 17:17.367
So don't ruin that the way

17:17.393 --> 17:19.284
that you ruined my
relationship with Benny.

17:19.309 --> 17:21.077
So you think I ruined that?

17:22.039 --> 17:22.997
That's interesting.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.997
Why do you think he didn't
accept your job offer?

17:24.998 --> 17:29.207
Because you got in his head
and you convinced him to.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.957
You and Benny have a
complicated relationship.

17:33.958 --> 17:37.417
No, we have a
complicated relationship.

17:37.418 --> 17:39.997
So stop trying to pass the
buck to Alison and Benny,

17:39.998 --> 17:43.207
because the truth is that we
just don't work well together.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.324
I mean, this is our marriage

17:45.349 --> 17:46.877
all over again.

17:46.878 --> 17:51.247
You just, you can't stop
digging and analyzing.

17:51.248 --> 17:53.667
You know, when I first met you,

17:53.668 --> 17:56.837
you were so blindly
confident and passionate

17:56.838 --> 17:59.247
and opinionated.

17:59.248 --> 18:02.077
I really liked that about you.

18:02.078 --> 18:05.497
Trust me, I've been wrong before.

18:05.498 --> 18:08.127
But not about this.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.287
This is exactly my point.

18:09.288 --> 18:11.287
We clearly cannot work on this case

18:11.288 --> 18:13.337
without it getting personal,
and wasn't it just bad enough

18:13.338 --> 18:14.627
the first time around?

18:14.628 --> 18:16.877
Tomorrow, I'm gonna go

18:16.878 --> 18:17.997
and I'm gonna get a new firm.

18:17.998 --> 18:21.337
And I'm sorry, Jason...

18:21.338 --> 18:23.338
Good-bye.

18:32.288 --> 18:33.417
I'm a high school principal.

18:33.418 --> 18:34.627
I'm a high school principal.

18:34.628 --> 18:35.877
I'm a drummer in a punk rock band.

18:35.878 --> 18:37.247
I'm a drummer in a punk band.

18:37.248 --> 18:38.287
I write freelance articles.

18:38.288 --> 18:40.337
I write freelance articles.

18:40.338 --> 18:41.667
Our mirror jury's set.

18:41.668 --> 18:43.837
Except we don't have a client,
so I'm not sure

18:43.838 --> 18:46.287
why we'll need a jury,
mirror or otherwise.

18:46.288 --> 18:48.377
I can't believe my sister fired you.

18:48.378 --> 18:49.446
Temporarily.

18:49.471 --> 18:51.377
She divorce you temporarily, too?

18:51.378 --> 18:55.377
We must protect this client from herself.

18:55.378 --> 18:58.537
This is exactly what Izzy wants,

18:58.538 --> 19:00.577
for me to come begging to her.

19:00.578 --> 19:02.485
To take me back, to help her.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.497
Have you ever considered
that you hurt her feelings?

19:04.498 --> 19:07.417
You rejected her, and we both know

19:07.418 --> 19:08.667
she's not used to that.

19:08.668 --> 19:10.787
All right, I'll try to get her back.

19:10.788 --> 19:12.337
Can't promise it'll go well.

19:12.338 --> 19:14.167
Well, it can't go any worse.

19:19.724 --> 19:21.973
How'd you find me?

19:21.998 --> 19:24.417
'Cause this is where you
go when you need quiet.

19:24.418 --> 19:26.997
Which is ironic, because...

19:26.998 --> 19:28.038
This place is loud.

19:28.039 --> 19:29.077
No.

19:29.078 --> 19:30.577
Because when I was studying for my LSATs,

19:30.578 --> 19:32.577
I sat right over there and you constantly

19:32.578 --> 19:34.057
yelled over my shoulder.

19:34.082 --> 19:35.362
And you got a 180.

19:36.799 --> 19:38.063
Why are you here?

19:38.088 --> 19:39.418
Izzy, come on.

19:39.443 --> 19:43.090
This is a really tough case,
and I want you to succeed.

19:44.288 --> 19:47.628
I wouldn't even be in
this situation if it wasn't...

19:48.748 --> 19:50.287
Forget it.

19:50.288 --> 19:51.337
What?

19:51.338 --> 19:51.898
No.

19:51.899 --> 19:52.696
What?

19:52.721 --> 19:54.417
Wh-Why are you shaking your
head like that... what?

19:54.418 --> 19:55.497
Okay, fine. If you would've come

19:55.498 --> 19:57.377
to work with me in the first place.

19:57.378 --> 19:59.287
My God.

19:59.288 --> 20:01.457
Izzy, come on. You're still on that?

20:01.458 --> 20:02.957
I would've been Alison right now.

20:02.958 --> 20:04.287
What's wrong with Alison?

20:04.288 --> 20:05.877
Did Bull tell you to say that?

20:05.878 --> 20:08.207
No. No, I came to my own conclusions.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.247
All right? As I can tell,
working for you is hard as hell.

20:11.248 --> 20:12.207
Would've been damn near

20:12.208 --> 20:13.837
impossible as your little brother.

20:13.838 --> 20:14.989
No, you don't know that.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.287
Yeah, I-I know that.

20:17.288 --> 20:18.837
Known that ever since the sixth grade,

20:18.838 --> 20:22.247
in San Juan, when you laid out
my outfits every morning.

20:22.248 --> 20:25.747
I mean, come on.
Law school, the D.A.'s office.

20:25.748 --> 20:27.577
That was all your idea.

20:27.578 --> 20:28.997
What you thought was best for me.

20:28.998 --> 20:32.287
It was just...
just time I went out on my own.

20:32.288 --> 20:33.457
But you didn't.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.287
You ended up working for him.

20:35.288 --> 20:37.108
My ex-husband.

20:37.133 --> 20:39.037
Do you think it was just a
coincidence that he offered you

20:39.038 --> 20:40.707
the job right after we got divorced?

20:40.708 --> 20:42.997
He wanted to win. And he did.

20:42.998 --> 20:44.997
Because he got you.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.077
I'm not a pawn.

20:48.078 --> 20:50.707
He didn't get me. I didn't choose sides.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.577
You just can't handle that
I was choosing for myself.

20:53.578 --> 20:55.577
And for once,
I wasn't your doting little brother,

20:55.578 --> 20:57.537
doing exactly what you said.

20:57.538 --> 20:59.337
Benny,

20:59.338 --> 21:03.037
do whatever you want with your life.

21:03.038 --> 21:05.804
I... I just, I know you.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.247
That's why I could advise you.

21:07.248 --> 21:08.378
Look, Izzy.

21:10.298 --> 21:13.587
What matters is that I'm-I'm happy now.

21:13.588 --> 21:15.047
You know?

21:15.048 --> 21:17.677
I joined TAC because it's an amazing job.

21:17.678 --> 21:20.297
You know, we-we help people,

21:20.298 --> 21:23.047
innocent people like you,

21:23.048 --> 21:25.257
if you'd just let us.

21:27.798 --> 21:30.677
Did you get our client back?

21:30.678 --> 21:32.427
Honestly, I have no idea.

21:32.428 --> 21:34.217
I tried.

21:34.218 --> 21:35.797
How is the jury we picked?

21:35.798 --> 21:37.257
Well, we got four jurors in the red,

21:37.258 --> 21:40.217
engaged in love/hate with
Izzy's public persona.

21:40.218 --> 21:42.925
Especially Leslie,
who's our covert perfectionist.

21:42.950 --> 21:44.507
But there's still two on the fence.

21:44.508 --> 21:46.337
Sara and Carlos.

21:46.338 --> 21:49.177
They'll be swayed as long as we
provide a plausible alternative

21:49.178 --> 21:51.007
as to where the bee pollen originated.

21:51.008 --> 21:52.427
And our dear Cable

21:52.428 --> 21:54.217
may have the answer in her

21:54.218 --> 21:57.377
eucalyptus-inspired update
on Olivia's routine.

21:57.378 --> 21:59.177
Not quite, but

21:59.178 --> 22:01.257
behold the dark side of perfectionism.

22:01.258 --> 22:02.507
Turns out that

22:02.508 --> 22:04.797
three weeks before Olivia's death,
she became pretty

22:04.798 --> 22:07.377
obsessive about following
Isabella's advice.

22:07.378 --> 22:10.047
6:00 to 6:30,
organize canned goods.

22:10.048 --> 22:11.927
6:30 to 6:45,

22:11.928 --> 22:13.588
- meditate.
- So she started all of this

22:13.591 --> 22:16.008
- just three weeks before her death.
- Means something.

22:16.011 --> 22:18.637
Specific inspired her to start this up.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.338
It's time for court, right?

22:25.298 --> 22:28.467
I should get a raise and be
fired for bringing her back.

22:28.468 --> 22:30.337
Love/hate.

22:30.338 --> 22:31.837
A lab report

22:31.838 --> 22:34.222
confirming there was bee
pollen in the smoothie

22:34.247 --> 22:36.377
and Bella's vitamin-infused powder.

22:36.378 --> 22:38.427
A mixture of ingredients
made in a factory

22:38.428 --> 22:40.427
where cross-contamination with bee pollen

22:40.428 --> 22:41.877
is very possible.

22:41.878 --> 22:44.928
I guess Miss Perfect
actually messed something up.

22:45.928 --> 22:48.257
Isabella seems nice enough to me.

22:48.258 --> 22:51.467
I like her makeup. Very natural.

22:51.468 --> 22:53.547
Doesn't bee pollen enhance sex?

22:53.548 --> 22:56.837
Now the defense will say,

22:56.838 --> 22:58.217
we couldn't test the packet,

22:58.218 --> 23:00.737
so we can't prove that that's
where the pollen originated.

23:00.762 --> 23:03.507
But when you see snow on
the ground, you know that

23:03.508 --> 23:04.798
it came from the sky.

23:07.718 --> 23:09.757
Well, you were right.

23:09.758 --> 23:11.338
- Good.
- I caught Juror Carlos

23:11.341 --> 23:13.427
leaving Juror Sara's apartment

23:13.428 --> 23:15.587
at 7:00 a.m. in yesterday's clothes.

23:15.588 --> 23:17.797
Romance is good for our case.

23:17.798 --> 23:20.637
Sara and Carlos will be in a
better mood, more open,

23:20.638 --> 23:22.877
and they'll vote as a team.

23:22.878 --> 23:24.297
Have we ever had jurors hook up before?

23:24.298 --> 23:26.177
Yes. It happens more
often than you think.

23:26.178 --> 23:28.507
If two jurors are sleeping together,

23:28.508 --> 23:30.507
it affects the whole jury.

23:30.508 --> 23:32.507
Our job is to create the same dynamic

23:32.508 --> 23:34.427
between our mirror jurors.

23:34.428 --> 23:35.967
Otherwise, we're flying blind.

23:35.968 --> 23:37.612
And how is that going, Chunk?

23:37.637 --> 23:39.297
Feels like a zoo experiment.

23:39.298 --> 23:42.177
I put Mirror Carlos next to
Mirror Sara. Nothing.

23:42.178 --> 23:43.486
Marissa said that their profiles

23:43.511 --> 23:46.217
are a 96% match to the
real Carlos and Sara.

23:46.218 --> 23:47.717
They should be engaged by now!

23:47.718 --> 23:50.467
Proximity doesn't
necessarily create sparks.

23:50.468 --> 23:52.177
What was it with you and,

23:52.178 --> 23:54.547
Izzy, if I may ask?

23:54.548 --> 23:56.297
It was December 3,

23:56.298 --> 23:58.297
Union Square, my favorite bakery.

23:58.298 --> 23:59.837
She walked in covered in snow.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.337
Dumped most of it on my
raspberry Danish, and then,

24:02.338 --> 24:03.677
we just looked at each other.

24:03.678 --> 24:06.507
She didn't apologize,
but she did buy me a crescent.

24:06.508 --> 24:08.297
It was delicious. And that was it...

24:08.298 --> 24:10.337
Our moment of connection.

24:10.338 --> 24:14.217
And if we can find Sara and
Carlos's moment of connection,

24:14.218 --> 24:15.467
boom.

24:15.468 --> 24:17.467
Let's say it was

24:17.468 --> 24:18.717
dusty in the jury box.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.427
Sara sneezes, Carlos hands her

24:20.428 --> 24:22.502
a handkerchief, they lock eyes.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.297
In 1925!

24:24.298 --> 24:26.790
Carlos is into punk rock.
I doubt he carries a hankie.

24:26.815 --> 24:28.057
We have to get them together,

24:28.081 --> 24:30.837
or our mirror jury won't
accurately reflect the real one.

24:30.838 --> 24:32.047
We tracked

24:32.048 --> 24:33.717
the jurors' entire day.

24:33.718 --> 24:36.137
Not a single moment of
connection. They were

24:36.138 --> 24:37.824
chosen in voir dire, the judge gave

24:37.849 --> 24:38.988
the jury instructions.

24:39.013 --> 24:41.508
- They were specifically told...
- Wait. Whoa.

24:41.511 --> 24:42.468
That's it.

24:42.469 --> 24:43.427
What?

24:43.428 --> 24:45.988
Their jury instructions.

24:46.013 --> 24:49.307
The judge instructed them
not to fraternize,

24:49.308 --> 24:50.977
said it was forbidden.

24:50.978 --> 24:53.137
Let's think about these profiles.

24:53.138 --> 24:56.649
These two are mischievous,
and they enjoy keeping secrets.

24:56.674 --> 24:58.977
The forbidden nature of
their relationship sparked

24:58.978 --> 25:00.978
- a sense of danger.
- But with the mirrors,

25:00.981 --> 25:02.597
we put them together.

25:02.598 --> 25:05.069
It's time to give our mirror
jurors new instructions.

25:05.094 --> 25:06.960
As for our real jurors,

25:06.985 --> 25:09.517
we need to give them an
explanation for the pollen.

25:09.518 --> 25:11.517
Which I might have. So I looked

25:11.518 --> 25:13.637
into the factory, and all their
correspondence with Alison,

25:13.638 --> 25:16.177
like you asked,
and got a flawless safety record.

25:16.178 --> 25:17.178
I'm sensing a "but."

25:17.179 --> 25:18.177
But...

25:18.178 --> 25:20.597
their factory only puts out
a thousand boxes a week.

25:20.598 --> 25:22.057
So why was there a week

25:22.058 --> 25:24.597
when Bella Colón Brands
received 2,000 boxes?

25:24.598 --> 25:25.887
And that was the shipment

25:25.888 --> 25:27.557
that produced Olivia's tainted packet?

25:28.478 --> 25:29.640
Well...

25:29.665 --> 25:34.807
Okay, time to bring in
C.O.O. Alison for mock trial.

25:34.808 --> 25:36.267
We always use the same factory

25:36.268 --> 25:37.847
in Wisconsin for the vitamin packets.

25:37.848 --> 25:39.137
And you're the one

25:39.138 --> 25:40.977
who's in charge of the
supply chain, right?

25:40.978 --> 25:43.540
Yes, but...

25:43.565 --> 25:45.177
I-I tried really hard to make sure

25:45.178 --> 25:47.097
that all of are shipments are,

25:47.098 --> 25:49.267
um... coming in time, and...

25:49.268 --> 25:50.847
Alison, it's okay.

25:50.848 --> 25:52.017
I understand

25:52.018 --> 25:53.267
how this happened, how Izzy

25:53.268 --> 25:54.177
kind of made this happen.

25:54.178 --> 25:57.227
She holds everyone
to an impossible standard.

25:57.228 --> 25:59.097
She holds herself to that standard.

25:59.098 --> 26:00.807
That's why she's so successful,

26:00.808 --> 26:02.018
right?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.227
Maybe.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.767
But it can't be easy...

26:04.768 --> 26:07.387
for you, 'cause you know
how hard you're working.

26:07.388 --> 26:09.134
And you're doing everything you can,

26:09.159 --> 26:11.517
but she keeps pushing and pushing.

26:11.518 --> 26:14.689
Yeah, th-that's true.

26:14.714 --> 26:17.137
So when she asked you to double
production, and you knew

26:17.138 --> 26:19.258
the factory couldn't handle it,
what did you tell her?

26:20.838 --> 26:23.088
I...

26:24.138 --> 26:26.838
I didn't tell her.

26:27.968 --> 26:30.177
I didn't want to disappoint her, so...

26:30.178 --> 26:33.717
so I went to another
factory just that one time.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.007
Alison, tell me you didn't.

26:36.008 --> 26:37.297
It was the only way to keep up

26:37.298 --> 26:39.137
with your schedule! All I knew is

26:39.138 --> 26:41.048
I had to get the shipment in time!

26:58.048 --> 27:00.257
The plaintiff's attorney also discovered

27:00.258 --> 27:01.967
the second factory, and they've got proof

27:01.968 --> 27:04.007
that they process other products

27:04.008 --> 27:06.337
containing bee pollen,
so we might have to settle.

27:06.338 --> 27:09.113
But we don't know there was
cross-contamination for sure.

27:09.114 --> 27:10.177
I think we should consider

27:10.178 --> 27:11.838
- the possibility that...
- Okay, you know,

27:11.841 --> 27:14.257
Franklin, can you just give us a minute?

27:14.258 --> 27:15.588
Thank you.

27:23.548 --> 27:25.547
Sorry.

27:25.548 --> 27:27.547
You're not sorry.

27:27.548 --> 27:29.637
You knew about Alison, so...

27:29.638 --> 27:31.007
Forget it.

27:31.008 --> 27:34.087
It's okay to feel guilty.

27:34.088 --> 27:36.743
And it's okay to feel sad.

27:38.468 --> 27:41.427
What if I'm really the
reason that Olivia's dead?

27:41.428 --> 27:43.377
There's no proof of that yet.

27:43.378 --> 27:45.427
And we are gonna find
out what really happened.

27:45.428 --> 27:47.967
But how, how could I not have seen

27:47.968 --> 27:49.968
that Alison was cracking, and...?

27:51.968 --> 27:55.637
Was that what I was like in our marriage?

27:55.638 --> 27:57.587
Did I just

27:57.588 --> 27:59.217
push you away like that?

27:59.218 --> 28:02.257
I think that's on both of us.

28:02.258 --> 28:05.427
Okay, look, I know I have high standards,

28:05.428 --> 28:09.087
but I honestly just
don't get why that's bad.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.217
The problem is you push people away.

28:12.218 --> 28:15.507
When you demand more than they can give.

28:15.508 --> 28:19.377
I could really lose everything here.

28:19.378 --> 28:21.968
We're not gonna let that happen.

28:23.048 --> 28:24.717
You guys doing some post-marriage

28:24.718 --> 28:26.217
marital counseling?

28:26.218 --> 28:28.217
It's hard to say with her.

28:28.218 --> 28:29.467
Yeah, no kidding.

28:29.468 --> 28:31.177
Gets swept up in what she's saying,

28:31.178 --> 28:33.177
and then you think about it later, and...

28:33.178 --> 28:34.797
Like what?

28:34.798 --> 28:38.007
She said you only hired me so
that you could win the divorce.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.137
Come on, Benny.

28:39.138 --> 28:40.587
I already told you once.

28:41.806 --> 28:44.137
Fraternizing among fellow
mirror jurors is not allowed.

28:44.138 --> 28:46.427
This is breaking a cardinal rule.

28:46.428 --> 28:48.047
You were right.

28:48.048 --> 28:49.837
We got the mirror love birds together.

28:49.838 --> 28:51.984
But it won't matter once they find out

28:52.009 --> 28:53.883
that Izzy outsourced to
that other factory.

28:53.908 --> 28:56.555
They'll blame her for the
contamination, and we'll lose.

28:56.580 --> 28:59.007
Unless someone else is to blame.

28:59.008 --> 29:01.757
Cable you said you found something?

29:01.758 --> 29:05.137
So, you told me to dig into Olivia.

29:05.138 --> 29:07.467
Why she got so obsessive with
all that lifestyle advice

29:07.468 --> 29:10.797
three weeks before her death,
and it turns out...

29:10.798 --> 29:12.927
she suspected her husband was cheating.

29:12.928 --> 29:14.177
Meet Katrina.

29:14.178 --> 29:16.087
George had scrubbed their entire online

29:16.088 --> 29:18.467
correspondence, but...

29:18.468 --> 29:20.297
I recovered it.

29:20.298 --> 29:22.087
I think that Olivia was working

29:22.088 --> 29:23.297
so hard to win George back.

29:23.298 --> 29:24.877
Our sympathetic plaintiff

29:24.878 --> 29:27.927
just became a philandering
husband with a possible motive

29:27.928 --> 29:30.548
for murder. Let's get
Katrina in here, now!

29:33.048 --> 29:34.637
I'm not sure how I can help.

29:34.638 --> 29:37.337
Why don't you tell me a
little bit about George?

29:37.338 --> 29:38.967
Did you know he was married?

29:38.968 --> 29:40.257
We sparked immediately.

29:40.258 --> 29:42.257
How did you meet your wife Olivia?

29:42.258 --> 29:44.717
A wedding. We were
seated next to each other

29:44.718 --> 29:46.337
at the singles table and just

29:46.338 --> 29:47.427
had that immediate spark.

29:47.428 --> 29:49.427
He said the spark was gone with Olivia.

29:49.428 --> 29:50.912
He complained about her constantly.

29:50.937 --> 29:53.337
She was gaining weight,
her cooking was awful.

29:53.338 --> 29:56.177
Olivia was perfect.

29:56.178 --> 29:57.467
And how did he treat you?

29:57.468 --> 29:59.757
Great... at first.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.137
Then he started to pick at my flaws,

30:01.138 --> 30:03.177
just like Olivia, so I broke it off.

30:03.178 --> 30:04.337
But then he called,

30:04.338 --> 30:05.717
said he was leaving her.

30:05.718 --> 30:07.087
When was that?

30:07.088 --> 30:08.428
A week before Olivia died.

30:10.338 --> 30:13.757
Interesting. How would you
like to join me in court today?

30:13.758 --> 30:15.677
Olivia and I were so careful

30:15.678 --> 30:16.967
about her allergy.

30:16.968 --> 30:19.297
That pollen came from Bella's powder.

30:26.338 --> 30:29.257
Mr. Brooks,
given that your mistress

30:29.258 --> 30:31.587
has decided to join us and is now

30:31.588 --> 30:33.007
sitting in this courtroom,

30:33.008 --> 30:35.337
do you want to risk the
threat of perjury,

30:35.338 --> 30:38.032
or will you answer the question honestly?

30:38.057 --> 30:40.653
Were you or were you
not having an affair?

30:43.338 --> 30:45.523
Bringing in George's
mistress really helped.

30:45.548 --> 30:47.337
It turned these two for us.

30:47.338 --> 30:50.047
They bought George as a
plausible source of that pollen.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.617
Well, I hate to be rooting for murder,

30:51.642 --> 30:53.217
but it's better than gross negligence.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.507
Actually, we're in the clear.
Danny just called.

30:55.508 --> 30:57.637
That backup factory that
did the extra order

30:57.638 --> 30:59.637
has a perfect quality control rating.

30:59.638 --> 31:01.837
And the foreman is willing
to testify if we need him.

31:01.838 --> 31:04.027
So Alison's off the
hook for that mistake.

31:04.052 --> 31:05.504
Unfortunately, George

31:05.529 --> 31:08.217
and Olivia's marital
drama has soured the spark

31:08.218 --> 31:10.337
between Sara and Carlos.

31:10.338 --> 31:12.427
They are convinced
that love is imperfect.

31:12.428 --> 31:14.427
Then they look at Izzy,
and they see perfect,

31:14.428 --> 31:15.637
which makes them want to blame her.

31:15.638 --> 31:17.257
So if we don't put these
two back together,

31:17.258 --> 31:18.837
we may lose this case.

31:18.838 --> 31:19.995
We could bounce 'em.

31:20.020 --> 31:21.638
If they slept together,
they discussed the case.

31:21.662 --> 31:23.198
That's grounds for dismissal.

31:23.199 --> 31:25.087
No, then the jury would speculate about

31:25.088 --> 31:26.007
who ratted the lovers out.

31:26.008 --> 31:27.507
Who would get blamed?

31:29.928 --> 31:32.757
So we've lost Sara and Carlos,

31:32.758 --> 31:34.717
and we still don't have
perfectionist Leslie,

31:34.718 --> 31:36.837
because she wants to take you down a peg

31:36.838 --> 31:38.101
for being too perfect.

31:38.126 --> 31:40.337
So, we need to make Isabella seem

31:40.338 --> 31:42.507
less perfect, and get

31:42.508 --> 31:44.467
Sara and Carlos back together again.

31:44.468 --> 31:46.087
I don't know if we need
a Shakespearean sonnet,

31:46.088 --> 31:47.927
or an episode of The
Young and the Restless.

31:47.928 --> 31:49.637
Maybe a little bit of both.

31:49.638 --> 31:51.547
Would you like to get a drink with me?

31:56.048 --> 31:58.637
Three olives, never one or two.

31:58.638 --> 32:00.087
It's the aesthetic.

32:00.088 --> 32:01.837
It represent perfect balance.

32:03.258 --> 32:05.047
You feel you need to have
that in your martini,

32:05.048 --> 32:06.797
'cause you don't have it in real life?

32:06.798 --> 32:10.007
I though you were gonna
work on less psychoanalyzing.

32:10.008 --> 32:12.718
Isn't that Isabella Colen?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.640
My God, it is.

32:15.665 --> 32:17.547
All right, don't, Izzy, don't start.

32:17.548 --> 32:19.569
Don't throw our
sessions back in my face

32:19.594 --> 32:21.637
just because you're Mr. Three PhD's...

32:21.638 --> 32:23.637
Okay, please, inside voice.

32:23.638 --> 32:25.137
Don't you

32:25.138 --> 32:26.548
patronize me!

32:27.205 --> 32:29.677
What the hell is this?

32:29.678 --> 32:31.927
I thought Isabella was
out discussing the plan.

32:31.928 --> 32:33.467
This is the plan.

32:33.468 --> 32:34.148
Let's hear them.

32:34.173 --> 32:35.469
You enjoy controlling order.

32:35.494 --> 32:37.377
Okay, great. Okay, okay...

32:37.378 --> 32:38.838
- Now it's all my fault...
- Yeah, cute...

32:38.841 --> 32:40.719
To have a public fight with her ex?

32:40.744 --> 32:42.967
This is the last thing
she needs right now.

32:42.968 --> 32:44.637
Actually, given the juror map, this is

32:44.638 --> 32:45.967
exactly what she needs...

32:45.968 --> 32:47.298
public humiliation,

32:47.299 --> 32:48.677
A laundry list of her personal faults,

32:48.678 --> 32:49.877
all going viral.

32:49.878 --> 32:51.637
It's the best way to humanize her.

32:51.638 --> 32:53.007
You're a narcissistic asshat.

32:53.008 --> 32:54.086
You scripted this?

32:54.111 --> 32:55.967
Right down to the sarcastic clap.

32:55.968 --> 32:58.927
The name-calling, Isabella...

32:58.928 --> 33:00.797
He's a little too good at that.

33:00.798 --> 33:02.427
I'm sorry, but I have no desire

33:02.428 --> 33:04.217
to tamper with a jury like this.

33:04.218 --> 33:05.837
We're not.

33:05.838 --> 33:07.083
The jurors aren't there.

33:07.108 --> 33:09.427
But if this happens to go viral,

33:09.428 --> 33:11.587
if certain jurors happen
to check their favorite

33:11.588 --> 33:14.007
social media sites,
which we know they've been doing...

33:14.008 --> 33:15.927
Then it's on them, not us.

33:15.928 --> 33:17.217
Has Isabella agreed to all this?

33:17.218 --> 33:19.047
Well, she...

33:19.048 --> 33:20.467
agreed in concept. I don't think

33:20.468 --> 33:21.837
that she was aware that Bull's

33:21.838 --> 33:22.778
about to go off-script.

33:22.779 --> 33:23.717
That's why your

33:23.718 --> 33:25.547
relationships always fail and that's

33:25.548 --> 33:27.467
why you're so unhappy, Izzy.

33:27.468 --> 33:29.257
What?

33:29.258 --> 33:30.638
Am I wrong?

33:31.966 --> 33:33.545
And there it is.

33:33.570 --> 33:35.797
Surprising her was the only
way to get a real reaction.

33:35.798 --> 33:37.927
The jurors hated her for being perfect,

33:37.928 --> 33:39.427
but once they see her vulnerable,

33:39.452 --> 33:41.414
- like this...
- The jury won't feel the need

33:41.439 --> 33:44.138
to find her liable and knock her down.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.185
What-what are you... what are you doing?

33:47.210 --> 33:49.547
Why are you talking quietly?
Why are you off-script?

33:49.548 --> 33:51.797
I'm being honest.

33:51.798 --> 33:54.717
For once, maybe we should...

33:54.718 --> 33:57.468
both try being honest.

33:59.266 --> 34:01.243
Wait, they're still talking.

34:01.268 --> 34:02.470
I thought Bull was finished.

34:02.494 --> 34:03.887
I can't hear what they're saying.

34:03.888 --> 34:07.058
I... You pushed me away.

34:08.178 --> 34:11.306
You never really loved me,
you just, you studied me,

34:11.308 --> 34:14.847
like if I was one of your subjects.

34:14.848 --> 34:17.476
I just wanted to know the real you.

34:17.478 --> 34:19.226
And I think you were afraid

34:19.228 --> 34:21.226
that I would just discover your faults.

34:21.228 --> 34:22.937
But that's what I needed, Izzy.

34:22.938 --> 34:24.677
I needed...

34:24.678 --> 34:27.637
all of you to love you.

34:27.638 --> 34:30.478
And I did love you, Izzy.

34:34.228 --> 34:35.387
The baby,

34:35.388 --> 34:37.388
the miscarriage...

34:38.638 --> 34:40.137
I know.

34:40.138 --> 34:42.437
That was hard.

34:42.438 --> 34:44.438
I'm sorry about what happened.

34:48.938 --> 34:51.226
I wanted a family, too.

34:53.938 --> 34:55.266
What is that all about?

34:55.268 --> 34:56.976
I don't know. I couldn't hear it.

34:59.388 --> 35:00.477
Well, whatever it was,

35:00.478 --> 35:02.477
that's the most vulnerable
I've ever seen her.

35:02.478 --> 35:03.637
So...

35:03.638 --> 35:06.347
mission accomplished?

35:27.188 --> 35:28.777
That's because halfway

35:28.778 --> 35:32.108
was not ever gonna be far enough.

35:36.818 --> 35:38.737
Think our plan may be working.

35:38.738 --> 35:41.817
Danny said Carlos and
Sara met up this morning.

35:41.818 --> 35:43.397
If they're back to happy,
they'll vote as a team

35:43.398 --> 35:46.147
and be less likely to blame Izzy.

35:46.148 --> 35:48.398
And more open to your closing argument.

35:48.399 --> 35:49.399
Correct.

35:50.478 --> 35:51.688
Good.

36:02.278 --> 36:04.687
I couldn't hear a thing, but you
and Bull looked pretty upset

36:04.688 --> 36:08.067
during your fight. You okay?

36:08.068 --> 36:10.187
I will be, eventually.

36:10.188 --> 36:12.067
And you know what, on that note,

36:12.068 --> 36:14.027
you were right.

36:14.028 --> 36:16.237
I was what?

36:16.238 --> 36:19.527
Did I-did I just hear right?
I was what?

36:19.528 --> 36:20.977
- I was what?
- Yeah, I know.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.358
- Can you repeat that, please?
- I'm impossible.

36:22.361 --> 36:23.918
I couldn't hear you.

36:23.919 --> 36:25.477
Okay, okay... look.

36:25.478 --> 36:29.147
Growing up, I gave you advice because...

36:29.148 --> 36:31.317
I just, I saw how high you could go.

36:31.318 --> 36:33.477
You were that talented.

36:33.478 --> 36:35.527
And I don't think I ever
just stopped and asked you

36:35.528 --> 36:37.277
if those were the plans that you wanted.

36:37.278 --> 36:39.027
'Cause...

36:39.028 --> 36:41.067
you're my little brother.

36:41.068 --> 36:44.737
And believe me, it...

36:44.738 --> 36:48.108
took me a while to see
myself in any other way, too.

36:49.398 --> 36:52.897
I'm sorry.

36:52.898 --> 36:56.398
Truth is I... I don't know
where I'd be without you.

36:58.148 --> 36:59.397
Not a lawyer, not working here.

36:59.398 --> 37:01.357
No.

37:01.358 --> 37:03.437
Not that you need my approval.

37:05.028 --> 37:07.068
But you got it.

37:08.148 --> 37:09.397
As long as you win this case.

37:09.398 --> 37:10.687
That's it?

37:10.688 --> 37:12.107
- That's it.
- All right.

37:15.999 --> 37:18.107
Okay, Franklin,
you'll start the close with

37:18.108 --> 37:21.147
imperfection.

37:21.148 --> 37:23.357
We do everything we can to mask it.

37:23.358 --> 37:27.147
With online profiles that
make our lives seem fantastic.

37:27.148 --> 37:30.357
With beauty routines that hide our flaws.

37:30.358 --> 37:32.857
And when something goes
wrong, with finding

37:32.858 --> 37:35.067
someone else to blame.

37:35.068 --> 37:36.527
Okay, at this point,

37:36.528 --> 37:38.147
move closer to Izzy.

37:38.148 --> 37:39.737
Yes, she's made a career

37:39.738 --> 37:41.238
- out of creating...
- out of creating.

37:41.241 --> 37:43.027
An image of perfection.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.897
But that doesn't mean that she's perfect.

37:45.898 --> 37:49.027
If she's guilty of something,
it's that she works too hard.

37:49.028 --> 37:50.567
She tries too hard

37:50.568 --> 37:52.777
to help people achieve more

37:52.778 --> 37:54.607
in their lives. Now, this has

37:54.608 --> 37:57.317
helped her to create an amazing company,

37:57.318 --> 38:00.277
but Isabella will be the
first to admit it has not

38:00.278 --> 38:02.477
made her good at maintaining

38:02.478 --> 38:04.237
personal relationships, especially

38:04.238 --> 38:06.857
with those she cares about the most.

38:06.858 --> 38:08.048
I didn't write that.

38:08.072 --> 38:09.277
Neither did I.

38:09.278 --> 38:11.133
Before you blame her for this tragedy

38:11.158 --> 38:13.357
simply because it feels
good to blame someone,

38:13.358 --> 38:16.237
remember the legal question
before you... has the plaintiff

38:16.238 --> 38:20.147
produced a single shred of proof
that Isabella is responsible?

38:20.148 --> 38:21.277
No.

38:21.278 --> 38:23.737
Which means you must find her...

38:23.738 --> 38:25.937
Not liable.
And that's exciting news

38:25.938 --> 38:27.317
for Isabella fans. She's officially

38:27.318 --> 38:30.317
not responsible for the
death of Olivia Brooks,

38:30.318 --> 38:33.527
ending a difficult lawsuit
for the famous lifestyle guru.

38:33.528 --> 38:35.898
Kristen Goodwin reporting, back to you.

38:36.938 --> 38:39.277
Katrina.

38:39.278 --> 38:41.527
Hey. Thanks for meeting me.

38:41.528 --> 38:44.397
You were so integral to this case.

38:44.398 --> 38:46.277
Happy to help. I'm excited
to meet Isabella.

38:46.278 --> 38:48.068
Where is she? I'm a big fan.

38:48.069 --> 38:49.857
I know. You'd literally

38:49.858 --> 38:51.357
kill to meet her.

38:51.358 --> 38:52.687
George told you that he was gonna

38:52.688 --> 38:54.817
leave his wife to be with you.

38:54.818 --> 38:56.317
That was just a fairy tale.

38:56.318 --> 38:57.607
Wasn't it?

38:57.608 --> 39:00.084
So you decided to help
things along by slipping

39:00.109 --> 39:02.067
into Olivia's drink the
one thing you knew

39:02.068 --> 39:04.607
that she was deathly allergic to.

39:04.608 --> 39:05.797
This is ridiculous.

39:05.822 --> 39:07.055
But it got us a warrant.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.647
You said you had keys to their house

39:08.648 --> 39:11.477
for your romantic trysts.
And your boss said you were late

39:11.478 --> 39:13.608
to work the morning of Olivia's death.

39:13.611 --> 39:16.147
I can only wonder what
the police have found.

39:16.148 --> 39:19.317
Traces of bee pollen on a shirt,
thanks to social media,

39:19.318 --> 39:22.687
they can prove Katrina wore the
day that she was late to work.

39:22.688 --> 39:24.027
Come with me.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.687
You have the right to remain silent.

39:25.712 --> 39:27.021
Anything you say can

39:27.022 --> 39:28.862
and will be held against
you in a court of law.

39:40.398 --> 39:43.357
That smells nice.

39:43.358 --> 39:45.317
Katrina's been arrested.

39:45.318 --> 39:47.647
Well, I'm happy

39:47.648 --> 39:49.527
it has nothing to do with my company,

39:49.528 --> 39:52.792
but I still feel awful about Olivia.

39:52.817 --> 39:56.477
Olivia wasn't following your
advice to win George back.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.857
I had Danny and Cable
continue the deep dive.

39:58.858 --> 40:02.567
She was leaving George,
starting a new life.

40:02.568 --> 40:06.317
And you, with your advice, inspired her.

40:06.318 --> 40:08.397
Thank you.

40:08.398 --> 40:11.567
For that and for Benny.

40:11.568 --> 40:12.977
We're talking again.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.977
Good.

40:14.978 --> 40:16.977
He and I need to do the same.

40:16.978 --> 40:19.897
Settle a few things.

40:19.898 --> 40:21.608
You remember how we started?

40:22.938 --> 40:23.938
Forbidden love.

40:24.898 --> 40:26.357
Like your jurors.

40:26.358 --> 40:27.668
Then we were off to Puerto Rico.

40:28.978 --> 40:30.977
To meet your parents

40:30.978 --> 40:32.737
and tell them about us.

40:34.318 --> 40:36.188
But in the end...

40:38.818 --> 40:42.108
I didn't know how to
handle losing our baby.

40:45.108 --> 40:47.608
Forgive me for not
knowing how to help you.

40:49.528 --> 40:51.607
That's the most powerless I've ever felt.

40:51.608 --> 40:53.108
No...

40:54.898 --> 40:58.607
I know you tried.

40:58.608 --> 41:00.897
I didn't need you to heal me.

41:00.898 --> 41:03.398
I need you to mourn with me.

41:05.068 --> 41:07.317
It was the only way I knew how.

41:07.318 --> 41:10.067
It still is.

41:10.068 --> 41:13.607
Fatal flaw.

41:13.608 --> 41:17.567
Hey, I thought you said this
was about trial science.

41:17.568 --> 41:19.477
Yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

41:20.818 --> 41:22.648
But you were right.

41:24.398 --> 41:25.688
It was more than that.

41:27.487 --> 41:30.226
It always is with you.

41:52.398 --> 41:54.567
Thank you..

41:54.568 --> 41:57.567
Two overpriced scotches in one case.

41:57.568 --> 42:00.687
Must have won a big payday
in Izzy's trial?

42:00.688 --> 42:02.818
- Well... this isn't about Izzy.
- No?

42:02.821 --> 42:04.277
It's about us.

42:04.278 --> 42:06.607
Rest of the team's not coming.

42:07.795 --> 42:09.147
So I'm being fired.

42:09.148 --> 42:12.567
Well, it's a classy way to go out.

42:12.568 --> 42:14.567
The answer is no.

42:14.568 --> 42:15.567
Sorry?

42:15.568 --> 42:16.426
No.

42:16.451 --> 42:19.357
I didn't hire you to win the divorce.

42:19.358 --> 42:21.817
I hired you because you're you.
And you're the best

42:21.818 --> 42:23.437
at what you do, and I knew that

42:23.438 --> 42:25.277
after my divorce, there was

42:25.278 --> 42:28.478
one lasting part of my marriage
I wanted to hold on to.

42:33.358 --> 42:35.437
You thought I meant our friendship?

42:35.438 --> 42:37.311
Sorry, that's awkward.

42:37.336 --> 42:39.343
I meant that antique clock
in Izzy's dining room.

42:39.368 --> 42:40.616
I want that.

42:40.641 --> 42:41.702
- You want that?
- Yeah.

42:41.727 --> 42:43.878
I hate that damn clock. It's yours.
