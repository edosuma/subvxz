WEBVTT

00:01.142 --> 00:03.769
Tammy says you got Christmas geese.

00:03.937 --> 00:05.479
Yep.

00:07.649 --> 00:09.942
We're leaving, thank fuck.

00:10.818 --> 00:12.528
Well, give us one then.

00:12.695 --> 00:14.238
Right now?

00:14.614 --> 00:16.198
Yeah.

00:17.367 --> 00:20.160
That one's spare. Help yourself.

00:20.328 --> 00:21.495
You having a laugh?

00:21.663 --> 00:23.872
What?
It's fucking alive.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.792
I suppose you'd better kill it then.

00:28.294 --> 00:29.878
How?

00:33.675 --> 00:35.884
Gently put its head down there.

00:36.052 --> 00:39.138
Quick in the back of skull with this.
Pluck it while it's warm.

00:40.265 --> 00:42.683
Little pot to catch all the blood.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.810
You enjoy that?

00:45.562 --> 00:46.979
No.

00:47.147 --> 00:50.232
But in my low-wage economy,
this flock's worth a lot.

00:53.903 --> 00:56.655
You are one sick fuck, Andy.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.324
Grow up.
What, mate?

00:59.492 --> 01:02.744
I said, grow up.

01:03.037 --> 01:04.745
Little drummer boy.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.223 --> 01:24.433
Tam phoned this morning.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.352
Told me to finish the house.

01:27.520 --> 01:31.940
Goes on the market in the spring,
and that's it. Over.

01:33.735 --> 01:36.778
Why does the asshole
always get the girl?

01:38.156 --> 01:41.325
Come on, or you'll miss that train.

02:01.387 --> 02:03.222
Andy.

02:03.389 --> 02:07.809
So, what about this shed?
Am I dismantling it or mending it?

02:07.977 --> 02:09.519
Hang on.

02:14.108 --> 02:16.902
I don't know. The shed.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.403
What do you think?

02:19.113 --> 02:21.406
I recommend preserving it.

02:21.574 --> 02:22.991
Really?

02:23.409 --> 02:27.162
Always useful, a good shed.

02:27.914 --> 02:31.792
Well, then keep it.

02:46.808 --> 02:50.143
Classy job, Uncle Andy.

02:51.020 --> 02:54.356
It's like, transformed.

02:54.524 --> 02:56.441
Ben won't like this.

02:56.609 --> 02:58.610
Bit boring.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.863
Bit old folks.

03:02.031 --> 03:04.866
I like those curtains. And I like that.

03:05.034 --> 03:08.036
No, don't like those lamps,
or that paper.

03:08.204 --> 03:11.164
I'd have gold leaf embossed
all round there,

03:11.332 --> 03:13.375
and a wall of flamingo.

03:13.543 --> 03:17.462
Ben would like that.
That's a lovely chair.

03:18.381 --> 03:20.549
What's under here?

03:31.352 --> 03:32.936
I'd have a bead curtain.

03:33.104 --> 03:38.900
And the bathroom needs to be darker,
like deep chocolate or velvet plum.

03:39.193 --> 03:42.404
And I'd bathe in scented oils.

03:45.408 --> 03:49.119
And then I'd be ready for Ben.

03:50.747 --> 03:54.499
It won't just be a shag, Case.
It'll be an event.

03:54.667 --> 04:00.297
I'll be wearing, like, a gossamer
shirt and a bra set, Prada.

04:00.465 --> 04:02.549
And he'll be wearing a black T-shirt.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.929
And it'll be all taut over his buff bod.

04:08.097 --> 04:12.225
And underneath,
Calvin Klein boxers, black.

04:13.144 --> 04:17.481
And he'll have a tattoo of my name,
and lush pecs.

04:17.648 --> 04:20.776
And I'll smell of Allure by Chanel.

04:23.112 --> 04:26.281
And he tries to resist me
but I'm a vision.

04:28.951 --> 04:31.078
But also respectful.

04:31.245 --> 04:34.623
And my V plates will melt
into nothing.

04:37.293 --> 04:38.460
Are you listening?

04:39.003 --> 04:40.921
I like this.
What?

04:41.089 --> 04:44.132
There's this bit where Tamara's dad
takes her out for dinner,

04:44.300 --> 04:47.427
and she thinks it's some big treat,
but what he's doing, right,

04:47.595 --> 04:51.264
is telling her that he's leaving them,
and she... Right, she's gutted.

04:51.432 --> 04:54.810
She yaks up her food into her napkin
and puts it on his plate.

04:55.186 --> 04:58.188
So?
It's painful.

04:58.398 --> 05:03.318
But funny.
It's about her, Plastic Fantastic.

05:03.820 --> 05:08.740
Jode, she's sad.
Sad? She's a lucky cow.

05:13.663 --> 05:15.997
I've been re-reading
Inchcombe Etherised,

05:16.165 --> 05:18.041
one of Nicholas's early books.

05:18.209 --> 05:22.170
There's a character, Theo,
who's an adulterer.

05:22.338 --> 05:28.009
And Theo has a list of golden rules
called Lulling the Spouse.

05:28.386 --> 05:33.306
"To allay suspicion," he says,
"you must first arouse it."

05:33.558 --> 05:35.976
Nicholas rang me earlier
to say he was going to be late home.

05:37.353 --> 05:39.479
Yeah, I just bumped into
Raoul and Celia.

05:39.647 --> 05:42.190
I said, "That's nice."

05:42.358 --> 05:45.402
And thought, "Have you?"

05:45.695 --> 05:47.696
And I couldn't shake the suspicion.

05:47.864 --> 05:50.657
So after an hour, I phoned Raoul.

05:52.118 --> 05:54.828
Hello? Yeah, he's right here.

05:54.996 --> 05:57.789
And he put Nicholas
straight on the line.

05:57.957 --> 05:59.875
Hello.

06:00.877 --> 06:03.879
He's been telling the truth a lot
recently.

06:04.672 --> 06:06.965
Is he lulling me?

06:11.888 --> 06:15.432
I might remind him
that in Inchcombe Etherized,

06:15.600 --> 06:19.352
Theo's wife runs him through
with a carving knife.

06:33.951 --> 06:35.744
What are you doing?
Just messing.

06:35.912 --> 06:37.746
I got three valentines.

06:37.914 --> 06:40.665
One from Mom,
one from that peanut Ryan,

06:40.833 --> 06:42.751
and a mystery one from Ben.

06:43.419 --> 06:45.212
I sent you that.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.964
Is that theirs?

06:48.174 --> 06:50.258
It's my mom's.
They don't drink this shit.

06:50.426 --> 06:52.969
Come upstairs
and look at what I'm doing.

06:54.013 --> 06:58.767
I've got into her e-mails.
We have to get Ben to come back.

06:59.852 --> 07:01.269
I'm sending him a valentine.

07:01.437 --> 07:03.271
No, you're not.
From her address.

07:03.439 --> 07:05.941
Then he'll think it's from Tamara,
you dipshit.

07:06.108 --> 07:08.318
But I know it'll be from me.

07:08.486 --> 07:11.863
Hot love.

07:12.865 --> 07:14.449
Oh, God. Jody.

07:15.159 --> 07:18.245
"Contacts." Where are you, Ben?

07:18.412 --> 07:21.122
There's that bloke my mom works for,
Nicholas Hardiment.

07:21.290 --> 07:23.792
Let's put him on. Who else?

07:23.960 --> 07:27.128
Uncle Andy.
Andy Cobb.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.507
Come to Winnards Farm.

07:30.675 --> 07:36.555
I'll give you the biggest shagging
of your life.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.057
Love, Tamara. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

07:39.225 --> 07:42.978
Don't ever, ever send that.
I just did.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.482
What the fuck is this?

07:48.818 --> 07:51.069
"Come to Winnards Farm,

07:52.822 --> 07:56.241
and I'll give you
the biggest shagging of your life."

07:56.409 --> 07:59.911
"I'll give you the biggest shagging
of your life."

08:02.498 --> 08:04.082
Are you listening to me?

08:04.250 --> 08:08.086
Ben, will you stop drumming?
I didn't write that e-mail.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.629
Why don't you believe me?

08:09.797 --> 08:11.298
When Fran started
fucking Steve Culley,

08:11.465 --> 08:13.717
at least she had the decency
not to tell the whole world.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.260
What's that supposed to mean?

08:17.805 --> 08:20.682
She must want a foursome or something.

08:21.684 --> 08:24.185
You fancy a foursome
with Nicholas Hardiment?

08:24.353 --> 08:25.770
Bugger that.

08:25.938 --> 08:27.355
What was she thinking?

08:27.523 --> 08:30.525
Well, maybe she's trying
to make you jealous.

08:30.693 --> 08:33.236
Or maybe she's trying
to make the boyfriend jealous.

08:33.404 --> 08:36.530
Or maybe she's just trying
to give him a really big hint

08:36.698 --> 08:38.325
that she's not getting enough.

08:38.491 --> 08:41.703
Or maybe she's just a bit kinky.
Or maybe she's crazy.

08:41.871 --> 08:44.748
Or maybe she was off her face.

08:44.915 --> 08:45.999
She was pissed.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.543
I wasn't
pissed or depraved or anything.

08:48.711 --> 08:49.878
It's okay. It's okay.

08:50.046 --> 08:52.964
Can you go look at the house?
To make sure no one's been in.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.883
No problem.
Thanks.

08:55.051 --> 08:56.384
Ben's really pissed off.

08:56.552 --> 08:58.720
He's massively got the hump.
Have I?

08:58.888 --> 09:01.681
I've just asked Andy
to have a look at Winnards.

09:01.849 --> 09:04.184
I've got to go, I'm sorry.

09:04.352 --> 09:06.061
Are you a fucking idiot?
What?

09:06.228 --> 09:09.731
Are you thick? Isn't it obvious who wrote
that e-mail? That tosser Andy Cobb.

09:09.899 --> 09:12.108
Andy wouldn't do that.
Making himself cozy in your house,

09:12.276 --> 09:14.819
going through your stuff.
Probably got a pair of your pants on.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.655
Bet it was him who nicked
my black T-shirt.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.532
Of course, he didn't.
That's it, jumping to his defense.

09:19.700 --> 09:22.535
He hasn't done anything.
Boss. Boss.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.414
What are you doing?

09:26.957 --> 09:28.792
You know Fran's having a baby.

09:28.959 --> 09:32.045
She wanted to see me.
I wasn't going to, but now,

09:32.797 --> 09:34.422
why not?

09:35.132 --> 09:37.592
Come on, Boss, let's go for a crap.

09:39.178 --> 09:42.180
Come on, mom, she's just stirring shit.
Tamara's always done that.

09:42.348 --> 09:45.850
Yes, but why?
You know how subversive she is.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.813
She once sent me a valentine
from Prince Harry and I believed it.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.691
It's her sense of humor.
She likes causing trouble.

09:52.858 --> 09:56.236
At school, she used to give us
first-years tips on how to shoplift.

09:56.404 --> 09:58.613
She taught you how to shoplift?

09:58.781 --> 10:02.158
Mom, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.

10:02.326 --> 10:04.411
Why would she look at an old git
like Dad?

10:04.578 --> 10:06.496
I just don't get the joke.

10:06.664 --> 10:08.957
And why is your father on the e-mail?
And Andy?

10:09.125 --> 10:12.001
It's so tasteless.
Help me out with these, would you?

10:12.169 --> 10:14.295
I have to work on
my thesis on the Taliban.

10:14.463 --> 10:16.256
Taliban, I know.

10:21.262 --> 10:24.514
What do you make of that e-mail
from Tamara?

10:24.682 --> 10:26.516
Don't make any sense.

10:26.684 --> 10:30.395
That London boyfriend's trying
to fuck her up. That's my theory.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.772
She could do so much better.

10:33.149 --> 10:35.024
I couldn't agree more.

10:40.489 --> 10:43.408
It's Ben.
"Who's the Daddy?"

10:44.160 --> 10:45.785
"Steve Culley and Fran Redmond

10:45.953 --> 10:48.788
recently announced
they were expecting.

10:48.956 --> 10:53.752
But in a valentine-tryst shocker,
Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.712
Ben and Fran, we say, 'Get a room."'

10:55.880 --> 10:59.257
He's back with Fran?
After you sent that e-mail, Jode.

10:59.425 --> 11:01.509
No way. No way.

11:03.846 --> 11:05.180
There's Plastic.

11:06.682 --> 11:09.350
Oh, my God, what have I done?
What have you done?

11:09.518 --> 11:11.186
What if Ben's dumped her?

11:13.189 --> 11:15.190
What if he never comes back?

11:41.008 --> 11:43.468
I'll never see Ben again
and it's all my fault.

11:43.969 --> 11:46.221
What's all your fault?
None of your business.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.307
I'm bloody sick of you looking
like a wet weekend.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.725
Who's Ben?
No one.

11:50.893 --> 11:52.310
What have you done?
Nothing.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.438
You in trouble?
No, leave me alone.

11:55.689 --> 11:58.066
You take care with boys, Jody.

11:58.234 --> 12:00.652
You know what can happen.

12:02.530 --> 12:03.571
What can happen?

12:03.739 --> 12:08.117
What can ever, ever happen
in a place like this?

12:16.043 --> 12:19.754
Hello. I thought you were in London
with Ben from Swipe.

12:19.922 --> 12:23.424
I'm looking for Andy.
Well, he's not up at Stonefield.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.719
So where's this shag
you've been offering me?

12:26.887 --> 12:28.429
Fuck off.
Come on. I saw that e-mail.

12:28.597 --> 12:29.931
Well, I didn't send it.

12:30.099 --> 12:34.602
And I wouldn't shag you if you were the
last man left after a nuclear winter.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.063
I'll come round tomorrow then,
about 3?

12:37.231 --> 12:39.941
Drop dead, you smug prick.

12:43.904 --> 12:44.988
Watch out.

13:34.997 --> 13:39.500
Yeah, I'll probably stay at the
library another hour or two.

13:40.002 --> 13:41.836
Yeah.

13:43.213 --> 13:46.507
Yeah, just checking some law reports.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.844
You're a marvel.

13:51.013 --> 13:52.972
Okay.

14:09.531 --> 14:11.240
Hello.

14:13.827 --> 14:15.495
So,

14:15.955 --> 14:17.872
Nicholas.

14:27.049 --> 14:29.384
You can tell me to leave.

14:32.888 --> 14:35.431
You can throw me right out.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.271
Just say the word,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.400
and I'll go.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.931
Do you smoke after sex?

15:17.099 --> 15:18.766
I don't know, I've never looked.

15:22.438 --> 15:24.272
I used to watch you out of my window,

15:24.440 --> 15:27.150
helping your daughter
skateboard up the lane.

15:27.901 --> 15:30.111
Bit of an obvious crush, wasn't it?

15:30.612 --> 15:34.449
Is that why I'm here?
To expurgate the crush?

15:34.616 --> 15:36.117
I don't know.

15:36.285 --> 15:38.202
Or as revenge on your ex?

15:39.038 --> 15:41.414
I don't know, Nicholas.

15:41.623 --> 15:42.790
Why are you here?

15:44.084 --> 15:45.668
I should have thought
that was obvious.

15:48.464 --> 15:52.091
Since you climbed over that stile
in the summer,

15:52.926 --> 15:55.762
I haven't thought about
very much else.

16:02.936 --> 16:05.563
When can we do this again?
What about Beth?

16:05.731 --> 16:07.982
Beth and I have this kind of open...
Bullshit.

16:08.150 --> 16:11.444
Thursday?
Isn't life complicated enough?

16:11.612 --> 16:13.821
Don't put me in your column.

16:14.490 --> 16:16.741
In your dreams.

16:25.501 --> 16:27.668
Structure can be so sterile, can't it?

16:27.836 --> 16:30.004
I always think of it
as a 3-dimensional...

16:30.172 --> 16:32.006
Here he is.

16:32.466 --> 16:36.552
Oh, poor you. Was it awful?
I was starting to worry.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.932
Bloody terrible. Didn't move
till well past Chiswick, but look.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.851
I popped into Fortnum's.
My favorite teas.

16:47.064 --> 16:50.858
Oh, my goodness, you feel like my buzzy
toothbrush just after I've charged it up.

16:51.026 --> 16:54.529
You should go to London more often.
Well, maybe I will.

16:54.696 --> 16:58.282
Sorry, everybody. Traffic was a pig.
Do carry on. What have I missed?

16:58.450 --> 17:01.702
Well, I'm trying this magic realist bit
at the end of Chapter 3.

17:01.870 --> 17:04.204
That sounds very innovative.
You think so?

17:04.373 --> 17:07.666
Yes. I think I've always been waiting
for the, magic realist crime novel.

17:09.044 --> 17:12.046
Wuthering Heights, it's
kind of Angel of the North.

17:23.976 --> 17:29.397
So after two years of radio silence,
I contact my editor,

17:30.065 --> 17:33.651
and she loves... I mean, she loves
the chapters I did in the fall.

17:33.819 --> 17:36.404
Oh, Glen.

17:37.072 --> 17:38.698
I tried writing at the library

17:38.866 --> 17:42.243
but I could feel that awful paralysis
descending again.

17:42.411 --> 17:46.581
I missed everything that I've been,
you know, finding here.

17:46.957 --> 17:49.083
Oh, my God.

17:49.251 --> 17:52.044
It's so beautiful.

17:52.212 --> 17:53.921
Well, I'm very glad you've come back.

17:54.089 --> 17:55.923
Yeah, in a few solid weeks...

17:56.091 --> 17:58.259
Holy cow!

18:00.262 --> 18:02.138
Idiots!

18:02.598 --> 18:04.098
Morons!

18:08.145 --> 18:11.898
Hey, writers, let's egg
the self-regarding sacks of shit.

18:12.065 --> 18:15.109
It's half term, they're just bored.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.323
There's this theory that Hardy
gave his wife syphilis, you know.

18:20.490 --> 18:23.284
No evidence, but the symptoms fit.
Poor woman,

18:23.452 --> 18:27.205
she starts to get eccentric and then
she moves her bed up to their attic.

18:27.372 --> 18:28.414
The bastard.

18:28.582 --> 18:31.626
Meanwhile, Hardy falls in love with
a woman 39 years younger than him.

18:31.793 --> 18:35.588
I don't believe it.
Yeah, he was 65 and she was 26.

18:35.756 --> 18:38.299
Geoff.
Glen.

18:38.467 --> 18:39.967
Henry James?
Thomas Hardy.

18:40.135 --> 18:43.137
That's it, a Hardy book.
Coming well?

18:43.305 --> 18:45.890
Yes, actually.
He gave his wife syphilis.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.100
Jolly good.

18:50.145 --> 18:52.188
He's completely distracted.

18:52.356 --> 18:54.315
He's up and down to London
all the time.

18:54.483 --> 18:57.652
This latest Inchcombe's
taking everything he's got.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.446
It's really preying on him.

19:01.990 --> 19:04.367
Is it any good?
Because I keep changing things

19:04.534 --> 19:05.576
and...

19:11.500 --> 19:13.960
It's brutally candid.

19:14.753 --> 19:18.256
You lay yourself completely bare.

19:21.343 --> 19:26.347
It's a bit over-written.
It needs a good edit, but,

19:27.891 --> 19:29.433
it's very moving.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.270
Thank you.

19:32.437 --> 19:34.188
So,

19:35.023 --> 19:36.857
have I done my duty?

19:37.234 --> 19:38.859
Admirably.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.362
Now do I get my treat?

19:43.031 --> 19:45.700
You are so cheesy.

19:52.207 --> 19:54.875
Zero Ben sightings
in two whole months.

19:55.043 --> 19:59.964
Last time I saw Plastic,
she looked like a minger.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.966
All red-eyed and gutted.

20:02.175 --> 20:03.968
Ben's a love rat.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.012
You gotta face it, she should move on.

20:06.179 --> 20:07.722
She's probably topped herself.

20:08.056 --> 20:12.351
I would, if Ben dumped me.
Jode, don't say that.

20:12.519 --> 20:14.395
What if she's done something?

20:14.563 --> 20:17.273
Like got in the bath
with her heated tongs?

20:17.441 --> 20:20.568
Like taken a stack of pills.
Think she might be lying there,

20:20.736 --> 20:23.487
all choked in vomit and drug froth?
That'd be dire.

20:23.655 --> 20:26.532
If we find her, we'll get in the papers.
Oh, my God.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.576
Rock chick dead at Winnards Farm.

20:45.052 --> 20:47.219
What's Uncle Andy doing here?

20:59.649 --> 21:01.776
Ass biscuits.

21:11.495 --> 21:13.287
No answer.

21:13.455 --> 21:16.791
She could've been there days.
She could be all putrid-like, rancid.

21:16.958 --> 21:18.959
Oh, no, gonna chuck.

21:19.127 --> 21:22.922
All bloated and all greeny.
Uncle Andy will find her by the smell.

21:26.259 --> 21:27.551
Andy.

21:27.719 --> 21:30.930
- Bollocks, she's alive.
- Haven't seen you for a while.

21:31.515 --> 21:33.808
Thought you might be ill
or something, or depressed.

21:33.975 --> 21:36.227
I've had my head down, writing.

21:36.395 --> 21:37.478
Come for a drink.

21:38.021 --> 21:40.231
Let's lighten up.
I'd love to, but,

21:41.233 --> 21:44.402
I'm kind of on one with my writing,
and...

21:45.737 --> 21:47.279
Can we do it soon, though?

21:47.447 --> 21:50.991
I really would like to.
Just not right now.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.285
Sure.

22:03.839 --> 22:05.673
What is he doing here?

22:05.841 --> 22:07.800
He just came by on the off-chance.

22:07.968 --> 22:09.844
Off-chance of what?

22:10.011 --> 22:12.430
Something about the roofing
for the shed.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.105
Do you think he's in with a chance?
No way.

22:21.273 --> 22:24.275
Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.
Jody, he's my uncle.

22:24.443 --> 22:27.445
She'd be mad not to have him.
Bet he goes like a train.

22:34.327 --> 22:35.870
Let's go, my knickers are wet.

22:36.037 --> 22:38.164
Wait, wait.

22:41.877 --> 22:44.795
Oh, my God.

22:48.717 --> 22:50.050
Nicholas, go.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.479
"Prolific author
of intelligent crime novels."

23:01.646 --> 23:04.565
Fucking D-list.
How could she do that after Ben?

23:04.733 --> 23:07.902
He's not even a proper celeb.
Maybe she's numbing the pain.

23:08.069 --> 23:09.111
Trying to tear love...

23:09.279 --> 23:10.946
Shut up, Case.
She's just a slag.

23:11.114 --> 23:13.908
She went out and pulled a married man.

23:14.451 --> 23:17.703
Like that bitch
that went off with my dad.

23:19.247 --> 23:22.333
I know who I feel sorry for.

23:26.671 --> 23:29.298
Then there'll be the divorce
and acrimony,

23:29.466 --> 23:32.218
and Beth's world will fall apart.
Yeah.

23:32.385 --> 23:36.514
But maybe one day,
she'll put the bitterness behind her,

23:36.681 --> 23:37.932
and find a new love.

23:38.099 --> 23:40.851
Don't be daft. She's old, you sop.

23:41.019 --> 23:42.770
See?

23:43.480 --> 23:46.273
That's D-list's car.

23:47.859 --> 23:51.111
This is where he hides his car
when he goes to shag Plastic.

23:51.279 --> 23:54.323
Yeah. Dirty git.
Big old turd.

23:54.491 --> 23:58.118
He's a rotten cheater.
Like my dad.

23:59.120 --> 24:02.289
Come on, Case. Let's fuck him up.

24:06.419 --> 24:09.296
Shit salad.

24:12.634 --> 24:15.761
Oh, poor you.
What a drag.

24:16.137 --> 24:17.388
Yes, it's a frightful bore.

24:17.556 --> 24:19.181
I'll hold off on the paella then.

24:19.349 --> 24:21.267
You're a marvel. See you soon.

24:21.434 --> 24:23.060
Did you?

24:26.231 --> 24:29.191
Beth, can I use the printer?

24:29.359 --> 24:33.153
Nicholas is stuck on the motorway
with a flat tire,

24:33.613 --> 24:35.823
but I couldn't hear traffic,
just rooks.

24:38.159 --> 24:40.160
Sorry, um, did you want me
to read something?

24:40.328 --> 24:42.329
No. Can I use the printer?

24:46.334 --> 24:50.296
Nicholas, someone knows.

24:50.505 --> 24:53.465
Maybe we should...
Who cares?

25:02.851 --> 25:07.187
Casey, pop them. Pop them.

25:12.027 --> 25:14.903
Fucking bingo.

25:19.659 --> 25:21.910
Hello, Casey, how are you? Hello.

25:22.078 --> 25:24.163
All right.
Waiting for the bus?

25:24.331 --> 25:26.206
Bus got scrapped.
So it did.

25:26.374 --> 25:29.627
Well, hope it doesn't rain.

25:31.254 --> 25:34.256
Gutted for her.
Me too.

25:34.924 --> 25:37.426
Fat arse though, hasn't she?

25:40.805 --> 25:42.556
Send her the photo, Case.
I can't.

25:42.724 --> 25:44.767
Why not?
What if it ruins her life?

25:44.934 --> 25:47.019
We gotta do something.
Plastic's an idiot.

25:47.187 --> 25:50.022
She fucked it up with Ben.
We fucked it up with Ben, Jode.

25:53.068 --> 25:54.985
It's like...

25:57.572 --> 26:00.407
We've gotta rescue her from D-list.

26:29.771 --> 26:31.438
Casey.
What?

26:31.606 --> 26:35.776
She's back in touch with him.
She's got an e-mail from Ben.

26:36.069 --> 26:39.279
"Tamara, Fran's baby has come."

26:39.447 --> 26:42.783
Case, he says it's a little brown girl
with curly black hair.

26:42.951 --> 26:44.368
Cute.

26:44.536 --> 26:48.622
"I think we can safely say
it's Steven Culley's, not mine.

26:48.790 --> 26:51.291
Truth is, I feel free.

26:51.459 --> 26:53.669
Gig in Paris for a few days.

26:53.837 --> 26:56.964
If I bring him down,
would you have Boss?"

26:57.132 --> 27:00.801
Yes. Yes, he's coming back.

27:01.136 --> 27:03.429
What are you doing?
Dear, Ben,

27:03.596 --> 27:07.307
I have found a reliable dog lover
in the village.

27:07.475 --> 27:09.351
Who?
Please call Jody,

27:09.519 --> 27:13.397
You can't send that.
On 07700-900-929.

27:13.565 --> 27:16.483
I'm getting him back down here!
For who? You?

27:16.651 --> 27:18.819
Why not me?
Are you mental?

27:18.987 --> 27:21.613
"Reliable dog lover"?
You're making a great big mess...

27:21.781 --> 27:24.158
I'm making something happen!

27:24.492 --> 27:26.326
Otherwise, my whole life will go by,

27:26.494 --> 27:28.871
and I'll be 34
and washed up like my mom.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.166
And no one decent
will ever even have snogged me.

27:32.333 --> 27:35.169
If you do this, you're on your own.

27:35.336 --> 27:37.504
Fuck off, then.

27:38.006 --> 27:40.299
You twat.

27:43.678 --> 27:46.764
There's the festival brochure.
You're on in the Lanson marquee.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.683
And, um, I've marked a few bits,
in case you want to read.

27:49.851 --> 27:52.811
You're a marvel. Cheers.

27:52.979 --> 27:54.646
I could come with you.

27:54.814 --> 27:57.024
Don't. You hate festivals.

27:57.192 --> 28:00.152
But it's only Hadditon. I'll come.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.197
It'll be completely boring.
You'll hate it.

28:03.364 --> 28:05.240
Stay here.

28:26.679 --> 28:30.891
Wanker! Right.

28:32.894 --> 28:34.436
Finished.

28:34.604 --> 28:37.439
I'm doing this cake in celebration.
Well done.

28:37.607 --> 28:38.941
Well, to Hardy.

28:40.318 --> 28:43.946
Yeah, even though I can't bear
the man for what he did to his wife.

28:44.322 --> 28:47.574
Thanks, Andy.
Just pop them over there.

28:53.206 --> 28:55.833
How do I find out who sent this?

29:01.339 --> 29:03.715
It says "number withheld."

29:06.261 --> 29:08.178
Did you know?

29:11.307 --> 29:13.600
I couldn't tell you.

29:13.935 --> 29:15.769
I'm sorry, Beth.

29:22.068 --> 29:23.861
Her.

29:24.279 --> 29:26.196
Oh, my God.

29:26.364 --> 29:29.408
This is just...
This is just horrible.

29:29.576 --> 29:30.617
Right under my nose.

29:30.785 --> 29:32.619
It's so shitty.
God, I feel sick.

29:32.787 --> 29:35.622
So insulting. You do not deserve
to be treated like this.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.457
If you're kind to me, I'll cry.

29:37.625 --> 29:40.502
And I don't want to cry,
I must be very clear.

29:40.962 --> 29:43.380
If there's anything that I can do...

29:43.631 --> 29:45.883
I have to do it by myself.

29:49.971 --> 29:52.639
Come on. Come on, Beth.
Come on.

29:52.807 --> 29:55.726
I trod in the sponge mix.

30:02.025 --> 30:04.902
Jody? This is Ben Sergeant.

30:05.820 --> 30:07.779
Yeah, that's right. I love dogs.

30:08.364 --> 30:12.117
Yeah, so I'll see you
at Winnards Farm at 2:00.

30:12.285 --> 30:14.745
Yeah. Perfect.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.172
Andy.

30:25.381 --> 30:28.091
Hey, how are you?

30:29.844 --> 30:32.846
I wondered if you wanted
to go for that drink?

30:33.348 --> 30:36.183
I need a friend at the mo...
You and Nicholas Hardiment.

30:36.351 --> 30:38.560
That's a nice piece of work, isn't it?

30:38.728 --> 30:42.689
I get it from his point of view.
He's always been a cheating wanker.

30:42.857 --> 30:45.609
Loves having his cake and eating it.

30:46.694 --> 30:49.655
But since when did your standards
drop so low?

30:49.822 --> 30:51.114
You could have anyone.

30:51.282 --> 30:54.034
All you have to do is bat your eyes.
Andy.

30:54.202 --> 30:58.121
I care a lot about Beth.
She helped me out when I was at rock bottom.

30:58.289 --> 30:59.831
I'm not going to split them up.

30:59.999 --> 31:01.792
It's just...
A bit of fun?

31:01.960 --> 31:04.878
It's none of your bloody business.

31:07.048 --> 31:09.549
Andy Cobb knows.
Cock pie. Has he told Beth?

31:09.717 --> 31:12.386
I don't know, but he might.
And I wouldn't blame him.

31:12.553 --> 31:14.012
I suppose it has to come out sometime.

31:14.180 --> 31:15.222
Does it?

31:15.390 --> 31:18.350
It's a good thing. Feels like a relief.
It means we can think about

31:18.518 --> 31:20.602
our plans for the future.
What future?

31:20.770 --> 31:23.313
I know it's been hard for you,
sharing me with Beth.

31:23.481 --> 31:25.607
But I'm yours now.
I'm gonna leave her.

31:25.775 --> 31:28.735
Mr. Hardiment. It's time.

31:30.029 --> 31:33.907
I want a new life with you.

31:37.078 --> 31:38.328
It's a nice dog, Mom.

31:38.496 --> 31:41.832
Well, I don't like having dog hair
and slobber all over the place.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.333
But I said yes.

31:43.501 --> 31:46.086
No dogs, no way, and that's final.

31:46.254 --> 31:50.382
You loser, I hate you!
You want to ruin my life!

31:52.093 --> 31:53.760
Live the dream, Jody.

31:53.928 --> 31:55.512
Well, it all runs very smoothly.

31:55.680 --> 31:58.932
I start a book in the summer
and publish it the following spring.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.101
Bit of a factory, really.

32:02.478 --> 32:06.606
So you've finished Like The Night, which
is the 17th of the Inchcombe adventures.

32:06.774 --> 32:09.943
And we all assume
you're planning the next one already.

32:10.111 --> 32:11.862
Well,

32:13.114 --> 32:15.157
there isn't gonna be a next one.

32:15.324 --> 32:16.450
- No.
- What?

32:16.617 --> 32:18.785
Frankly,
I'm sick to death of Inchcombe.

32:18.953 --> 32:21.580
In fact, I'm about to kill him off.

32:21.748 --> 32:23.165
- No.
- He can't do that.

32:23.332 --> 32:25.584
Well, I think
that's what we call in the trade,

32:25.752 --> 32:28.712
a bit of a bombshell,
for your fans here.

32:29.255 --> 32:33.341
Yes, but I'm moving on
to fresh pastures.

32:33.509 --> 32:35.302
No.

32:35.470 --> 32:37.721
Inchcombe is about to meet
a very sticky end,

32:37.889 --> 32:40.974
and it's one murder
I'm really looking forward to.

32:42.351 --> 32:45.771
Now, at this point, we should
get some questions, I think.

32:45.938 --> 32:49.733
And I'm...
Yes, there's a lady over there.

32:53.071 --> 32:58.075
You write a lot about adultery,
is that from personal experience?

32:59.202 --> 33:00.744
Madam,

33:02.747 --> 33:04.748
what a saucy question. Uh...

33:04.916 --> 33:07.501
But there's no need for an author's
work to be autobiographical...

33:07.668 --> 33:09.503
Why do you cheat persistently
on your wife?

33:11.172 --> 33:13.048
Who's that?

33:18.513 --> 33:20.639
Because she lets me.

33:22.016 --> 33:23.767
Tamara.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.062
Where?
Nicholas, this has got to stop.

33:27.230 --> 33:29.439
You're right. I can't go on using her.
Lying to her.

33:29.607 --> 33:31.024
It won't be fun but I've gotta do it.

33:31.192 --> 33:33.944
I don't feel alive with Beth.
I haven't been living for years.

33:34.112 --> 33:37.155
She's smothered me like a blanket.
Nicholas, listen to me.

33:37.323 --> 33:41.076
It was fun,
but it's wrong and it's over.

33:44.163 --> 33:46.832
I'm in love with you.
I'm sorry.

33:46.999 --> 33:48.375
No.

33:48.543 --> 33:52.003
No. No. No. You can't end it.
Tamara...

33:52.171 --> 33:54.214
Fuck supper!
Will you keep it down?

33:54.382 --> 33:56.800
My God, you're cold-hearted.
No, I'm not.

33:56.968 --> 33:59.761
You don't feel a thing, do you?
I do. I do feel.

33:59.929 --> 34:03.140
I feel like I'm blazing away inside
all the time.

34:03.766 --> 34:07.060
Why do I do these things?
What am I doing with you?

34:08.396 --> 34:11.523
There's someone else, isn't there?
For God's sake.

34:11.690 --> 34:14.400
Not the narcissist drummer?
Goodbye.

34:14.569 --> 34:16.277
It's that ignorant lunk, isn't it?

34:16.445 --> 34:19.322
That muscle-bound wastrel
Andy Cobb.

34:19.782 --> 34:23.076
Andy Cobb is a far better man
than you.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.290
Go on.

34:32.628 --> 34:36.380
Mr. Hardiment, will you sign this?
Imagine getting him to sign.

34:36.549 --> 34:39.050
I love your books.

34:55.650 --> 34:57.611
Thank you.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.287
Hello?

35:09.999 --> 35:12.792
It's Jody Long about the dog.

35:16.839 --> 35:18.548
Ben?

35:23.930 --> 35:25.639
Hello?

35:28.517 --> 35:30.117
Ben?

35:52.500 --> 35:54.501
Well, you gonna answer that?

35:55.753 --> 35:58.213
Jody, what are you doing
not fucking answering?

36:02.009 --> 36:06.012
Ben's dog is here. It's loose.
It means Ben must be up at Winnards.

36:08.099 --> 36:09.349
Boss!

36:11.018 --> 36:12.352
Dog minder?

36:13.562 --> 36:17.857
You've been breaking in, sending
e-mails and fucking people off.

36:19.193 --> 36:22.529
Did you nick my black T-shirt?
I just wanted to meet you. Just once.

36:22.697 --> 36:25.782
Just to tell you stuff.
Stuff? What stuff?

36:25.950 --> 36:28.034
Like, I love you.

36:28.703 --> 36:31.204
I really, really love you.

36:31.664 --> 36:34.374
That's really nice.

36:35.626 --> 36:38.920
I used to lie awake
thinking about you being here.

36:39.088 --> 36:40.755
In Ewedown.

36:40.923 --> 36:44.217
In the bum-hole of nowhere.

36:45.219 --> 36:47.971
When you left, I couldn't bear it.

36:48.347 --> 36:51.683
I just wanted to make you come back.

36:56.230 --> 37:01.026
Do you still love me, Jody?
Even though I wanna lock you up?

37:02.361 --> 37:04.446
What would you do for me then?

37:05.197 --> 37:07.365
Would you do anything,
like a proper fan?

37:08.826 --> 37:10.952
Let's see then, shall we?

37:12.246 --> 37:14.246
I bet that bitch wants a baby.
Well, she'll find out.

37:14.271 --> 37:15.471
Nicholas doesn't do children.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.584
He'll leave it all up to her.

37:17.752 --> 37:19.377
That'll age her.
Beth.

37:19.545 --> 37:22.088
Suppose he discovers fatherhood?
They do, these men.

37:22.256 --> 37:26.134
Second time around,
they get all nappy-happy.

37:26.302 --> 37:28.094
I was barely 20 when I got pregnant.

37:28.262 --> 37:31.598
I've never done anything. God.
Yes, you have. Look at this place.

37:31.766 --> 37:33.975
I've let him walk all over me.
Why? Why have I done that?

37:34.143 --> 37:35.518
I've wasted my life.

37:35.686 --> 37:37.479
No. What about the work
you've done here?

37:37.646 --> 37:38.688
Work?
Yes.

37:38.856 --> 37:41.858
What, breeding goats?
Baking fucking biscuits?

37:42.026 --> 37:43.360
It's meaningless!

37:44.779 --> 37:46.237
Beth.

37:46.447 --> 37:49.532
When I was lost with my book,
you helped me more than you know.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.951
You asked me who I was writing it for.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.454
You.

38:17.311 --> 38:19.104
Excuse me.

38:21.857 --> 38:23.441
May I speak with my wife?

38:23.609 --> 38:26.903
No, you may not.

38:28.572 --> 38:30.907
Beth. Beth.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.452
It's over.

38:35.371 --> 38:37.080
I've finished it.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.499
She's been chasing me.

38:39.667 --> 38:41.960
I think there's something
unhinged about her.

38:42.128 --> 38:43.586
This wild crush.

38:44.964 --> 38:49.092
Ben Sergeant's bloody dog again.
Go on, get out.

38:49.260 --> 38:53.555
Back to that tart at Winnards Farm.
Go on. Bugger off!

38:54.515 --> 38:56.015
Beth.

38:57.309 --> 38:59.018
You know I'm sorry.

38:59.854 --> 39:02.856
I want you to leave. I want a divorce.

39:03.023 --> 39:05.024
No, you don't. Don't be ridiculous.

39:05.443 --> 39:07.277
Now, look...
And I want this place.

39:08.070 --> 39:09.195
You can't.

39:09.697 --> 39:13.158
Watch me. I will.

39:14.535 --> 39:18.580
That's it, lovely. Keep it going, keep it going.
Stop. Couple of sugars.

39:20.416 --> 39:22.083
Stir it.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.721
That is a very good cup of tea.
Which is lucky for you, Jody.

39:34.889 --> 39:35.930
Had it been shit,

39:36.098 --> 39:38.683
I'd be on the phone to the extremely
scary local cops right now.

39:38.851 --> 39:40.226
Please don't tell my mom.

39:40.394 --> 39:42.979
I know it's boring round here,
but for fuck's sakes.

39:43.147 --> 39:44.731
I'm gonna get out soon as I can.

39:44.899 --> 39:48.401
I'm gonna work in Vegas as a croupier.
Vegas or a cruise liner.

39:49.361 --> 39:53.740
Aim high, Jody.
That's what I say. Aim high.

40:00.581 --> 40:02.415
Ben?

40:05.127 --> 40:08.254
You've had an infestation.
Of what?

40:08.547 --> 40:10.173
Jody.

40:31.445 --> 40:33.780
Hey, Greg!

40:33.948 --> 40:36.950
I want a word with you.
It's Glen, asshole.

40:37.117 --> 40:39.786
You fucking devious bastard.

40:39.954 --> 40:42.247
I'm devious? I'm a bastard?

40:42.414 --> 40:46.376
You think I haven't noticed
you've been worming your way in?

40:46.544 --> 40:51.214
You keep your hands off my wife,
you low-rent pedant.

40:52.299 --> 40:55.176
You've abused Beth long enough
with all of your goddamn lies.

40:55.344 --> 40:56.803
I want you out of my house.

40:56.971 --> 41:00.056
It's Beth's. She made this place.
And I fucking paid for it.

41:00.224 --> 41:02.559
I've given Beth all this.
What can you give her?

41:02.726 --> 41:06.771
I can give her integrity.
Obscure literary shit,

41:06.939 --> 41:08.356
not worth 10 pence.

41:08.524 --> 41:12.318
You know, if I made my fortune
fantasizing about rapes and murders,

41:12.486 --> 41:13.820
I wouldn't be so proud.

41:13.988 --> 41:17.323
You cretin.
Fuck you.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.450
Beth will come to her senses.

41:19.618 --> 41:23.913
You need an income to run Stonefield,
and mine's bigger than yours.

41:31.005 --> 41:35.717
Get up, Nicholas, come on.
Let's talk about this like grown men.

41:41.974 --> 41:44.767
Oh, my God. Nicholas.

41:45.144 --> 41:46.352
Nic...

41:46.562 --> 41:48.980
Get up.

41:57.197 --> 41:59.532
Nicholas, get up.

41:59.950 --> 42:02.535
Run. Come on. Get up.

42:09.209 --> 42:11.502
Nicholas. Nicholas.

42:47.414 --> 42:49.165
It was you?

42:50.417 --> 42:52.460
It was you who sent the e-mail?

42:52.628 --> 42:55.922
Jody's explained that she did it
out of a deep love for me.

43:00.094 --> 43:03.429
Tammy.
Ben.

43:14.274 --> 43:16.943
I think you should have this back.

43:17.611 --> 43:19.570
I'm sorry.

43:20.989 --> 43:23.616
Jody! The dog!

44:08.036 --> 44:11.956
Got him. The beast.

44:40.277 --> 44:42.028
Nicholas.

44:44.573 --> 44:47.950
God. Oh, God. Nicholas.

44:48.118 --> 44:49.869
Bitch. Brazen.

44:50.662 --> 44:51.996
Brazen.
Beth.

44:52.164 --> 44:55.750
That is brazen.
Beth, don't look! Please, don't look!

44:59.922 --> 45:01.839
Nicholas?!

45:08.222 --> 45:09.222
No!

45:09.389 --> 45:13.392
No, but you can see it.
It's broken. It's smashed.

45:14.645 --> 45:18.523
No, I haven't, but it's obvious.

45:20.359 --> 45:24.028
Yes, his wife. Yes, she is.

45:24.196 --> 45:26.948
Thank you. Thank you, I will.

45:28.534 --> 45:30.576
They're on their way.

45:32.371 --> 45:34.247
Beth, help is coming.

45:42.422 --> 45:44.340
It's broken.

46:14.538 --> 46:16.163
Tamara.

46:17.791 --> 46:19.458
Listen.

46:21.962 --> 46:24.130
I'm sorry.

46:25.632 --> 46:27.466
Come on.

46:27.634 --> 46:30.052
Are you blaming yourself?

46:32.139 --> 46:33.472
It was an accident.

46:48.739 --> 46:51.157
I'd better get back up to Stonefield.

46:51.575 --> 46:55.286
Come with me. We'll get this sorted.

47:00.334 --> 47:03.127
Then get Ben
to take you back to London.

47:03.754 --> 47:06.339
I don't want to be with Ben.

47:23.065 --> 47:25.399
Put it on the back seat right here.

47:37.245 --> 47:38.245
What are you doing?

47:38.413 --> 47:40.831
I figured it was best,
you know, that I take off.

47:40.999 --> 47:43.209
She doesn't want writers
around the place now.

47:43.377 --> 47:45.503
And police, autopsies, not my thing.

47:45.671 --> 47:48.047
You can't run away.
I'm not running away.

47:48.215 --> 47:52.385
I've finished my book.
My time here is up. Destiny calls.

47:52.552 --> 47:56.138
Beth is asking for you.
Really?

47:56.390 --> 47:58.724
She's on her own over there.

47:59.309 --> 48:03.980
Glen, she doesn't need a writer
around the place,

48:04.481 --> 48:06.565
she needs a man.

48:15.450 --> 48:17.785
I'm so sorry.

48:19.413 --> 48:21.914
It was my fault. I let the dog go.

48:22.082 --> 48:24.166
No. No.
I shooed him away.

48:24.334 --> 48:27.586
The police said it was an accident,
but if I'd caught him, tied him up...

48:27.754 --> 48:28.963
No, it wasn't your fault.

48:29.131 --> 48:32.341
What I don't understand is why was
Nicholas in that field anyway?

48:32.509 --> 48:34.969
He hated cows.
And when he saw them coming,

48:35.137 --> 48:39.890
why didn't he get out of their way?
Beth, I have to tell you that...

48:52.446 --> 48:54.572
You live in the country.

48:54.740 --> 48:56.824
You share it
with those dangerous beasts,

48:56.992 --> 48:59.744
and when they get scared, they run.

48:59.911 --> 49:01.912
Like we do.

49:03.373 --> 49:04.957
Oh, Glen.

49:08.295 --> 49:10.379
Stay with me.

49:44.581 --> 49:47.249
Kind of suits you.
Don't say anything.

49:47.417 --> 49:49.752
I always did like the old one.

49:53.006 --> 49:55.925
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
What?

49:56.093 --> 49:59.136
Made this place so beautiful
I'd never be able to leave.

49:59.304 --> 50:01.597
Been dying to get rid of you.

50:02.891 --> 50:04.809
This is my house.

50:05.560 --> 50:09.313
I was born in that room.
So you were.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.441
Welcome home.

50:53.233 --> 50:54.692
Pap-pap me.

50:55.443 --> 50:56.694
What?

50:56.862 --> 50:59.321
Pap-pap me.
