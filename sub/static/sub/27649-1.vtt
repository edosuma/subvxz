00:27.466 --> 00:29.361
Transaction. How can I help you?

00:47.665 --> 00:49.691
Thank you. Bye.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.079
I'll see you later.
Bye.

00:52.104 --> 00:54.640
Police emergency. What number are you calling from, please?

00:54.665 --> 00:58.280
O20 79460932.

00:58.304 --> 01:01.771
My name's Evie Williams. I'm phoning from a helpline, a support line.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.561
Somebody's just called from a phone box on Regent Street.

01:04.584 --> 01:06.891
They said they're going to cut somebody's throat.

01:06.915 --> 01:09.280
I've still got them on here now on another line.

01:09.305 --> 01:12.051
Stay with me. I'm going to send a unit there now.

01:12.075 --> 01:13.441
Hold the line, please.

01:13.465 --> 01:15.530
Oscar Victor One from Control.

01:15.555 --> 01:16.850
Receiving. Go ahead.

01:16.876 --> 01:20.409
Call in progress from a public phone box on Regent Street and Pall Mall.

01:20.435 --> 01:23.210
Responding. We're three minutes away.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.570
He was into you!
Do you think?

01:28.596 --> 01:30.409
Not the way I was dancing!

01:31.876 --> 01:34.570
He was quite fit, though.
I'm pissed.

01:34.596 --> 01:36.971
We didn't need that last bottle of Prosecco.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.280
We'll regret that tomorrow.

01:39.305 --> 01:41.329
Right, this is me.

01:41.354 --> 01:44.079
Thank you so much. I've had such a lovely night.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.131
You don't want me to stay?
No, no, no.

01:46.156 --> 01:48.930
No, honestly, I don't want to leave
Wu,
No, I'll be fine! Go, go, go.

01:48.956 --> 01:50.570
You sure?
Yes. Yes.

01:50.596 --> 01:52.329
I'm a big girl.
All right, see you later.

01:52.354 --> 01:54.131
Bye.
Bye, hon.

02:26.596 --> 02:28.539
Area searched. No trace.

02:57.235 --> 02:58.930
Hello?

03:00.385 --> 03:01.691
Hello?

03:06.385 --> 03:07.901
Ugh!

05:12.235 --> 05:13.800
Nikki. Hey!

05:13.826 --> 05:15.800
Hi. I'm back.

05:15.826 --> 05:19.050
Good flight?
Delayed. But I slept all the way.

05:19.076 --> 05:21.160
What about Matt? Is he OK? All well?

05:21.185 --> 05:23.800
Yeah. Never long enough, though.

05:23.826 --> 05:25.771
I'm going to drop my stuff off at home

05:25.795 --> 05:28.011
and then I'll come
straight in, yeah?
OK.

05:29.435 --> 05:31.089
Where are you?

05:31.115 --> 05:33.441
Hmm. Nowhere special.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.620
Sorry?

05:36.516 --> 05:39.252
Look, I'd better get on, OK? I'll catch up with you later.

05:39.276 --> 05:40.644
Welcome home, Nikki.

05:40.668 --> 05:41.973
Thanks.

05:45.149 --> 05:48.403
OK. Here we are. Typical gunshot entry wounds.

05:48.427 --> 05:50.283
Let's have a closer look.

05:50.307 --> 05:53.894
If the abrasion ring, here, is eccentric,

05:53.918 --> 05:56.043
that's going to suggest direction.

05:56.069 --> 05:59.043
Exit wound's usually bigger. They lack abrasion at the margin -

05:59.069 --> 06:01.973
that's a key feature - but you know all that, yeah?

06:03.869 --> 06:05.793
OK. Have a look at this.

06:05.819 --> 06:08.403
That's got to be an exit wound, yeah?

06:08.427 --> 06:09.923
Well, no, actually.

06:09.949 --> 06:12.694
Can you see? It's got a sort of D-shape to it.

06:13.918 --> 06:16.363
Yeah? That may indicate that the bullet ricocheted

06:16.389 --> 06:17.764
before entering the body,

06:17.788 --> 06:20.644
or that the weapon used was defective in some way, whatever.

06:20.668 --> 06:23.764
There are other ways to determine that, which I'll come on to later.

06:23.788 --> 06:27.514
But remember, things don't always conform to expectation.

06:29.829 --> 06:31.082
Right. What about this?

06:31.108 --> 06:34.514
What are you up to tomorrow? Can you spare me an hour?

06:34.538 --> 06:35.923
Um...tomorrow?

06:35.949 --> 06:37.254
No, no, I can't. I'm chocker.

06:37.278 --> 06:38.403
Why, what's up?

06:38.427 --> 06:40.514
I was told I had to do this formally.

06:40.538 --> 06:41.613
Formally?

06:41.639 --> 06:43.723
Don't laugh, I'm trying to be serious here.

06:43.749 --> 06:45.082
I have a proposal for you.

06:45.108 --> 06:46.923
I've spoken to your man in the Home Office,

06:46.949 --> 06:49.613
and he's very happy for me to talk to you about it.

06:49.639 --> 06:52.723
We are expanding, and we would like someone from Practice

06:52.749 --> 06:54.283
to lead this next phase.

06:54.307 --> 06:55.644
Oh, OK.

06:55.668 --> 06:57.363
And the job is...?

06:57.389 --> 06:58.894
Head of Faculty.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.163
Susie, I can deliver a guest lecture, but...

07:01.187 --> 07:04.413
Now, the plan is to completely overhaul student training,

07:04.437 --> 07:07.613
especially with pathology, and... Well, it's not just me,

07:07.639 --> 07:10.363
but none of us could think of anyone better than you.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.283
Right! Come on.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.803
Don't dismiss it out of hand.

07:13.829 --> 07:15.774
Think about it.

07:15.798 --> 07:18.254
Look, I'm flattered. Thank you...

07:18.278 --> 07:20.564
..but it's really not for me.

07:20.588 --> 07:22.803
I'm going to send some stuff over, anyway.

07:22.829 --> 07:24.124
OK.

07:24.149 --> 07:26.082
I'd better take this. See you.

07:27.307 --> 07:28.483
Hey.

07:28.509 --> 07:29.874
Yeah. Where do you need me?

07:37.548 --> 07:38.923
Thank you.

08:05.509 --> 08:06.803
Lovely.

08:08.079 --> 08:10.004
They lD'd him?
No.

08:10.028 --> 08:11.644
No wallet, no phone.

08:12.798 --> 08:16.524
Bruising to the right side of his face, and his throat's been cut.

08:16.548 --> 08:19.103
Extensive arterial spatter.

08:19.127 --> 08:20.302
Who's in charge?

08:20.327 --> 08:22.994
DI Carey Murphy.
Jack Hodgson. Good to meet you.

08:23.019 --> 08:25.713
Would you go down there late at night if you were a woman?

08:25.738 --> 08:27.994
I wouldn't do it at all, not without full body armour

08:28.019 --> 08:30.713
and a hazmat suit - unless I was away in the head, of course.

08:30.738 --> 08:34.073
And how did our attacker not see the witness in the next cubicle?

08:34.099 --> 08:35.514
He must have, right?

08:35.538 --> 08:39.073
Well, the lock's not working, so...maybe he thought it was empty?

08:39.099 --> 08:40.222
Don't know.

08:40.248 --> 08:42.432
I've got the CCTV.

08:42.457 --> 08:44.634
Here's the victim going in.

08:48.207 --> 08:50.153
Followed shortly by this person.

08:50.178 --> 08:53.302
Could be the perp. I'll get that cleaned up and see what we've got.

08:53.327 --> 08:54.823
You got anything for me?

08:54.849 --> 08:57.663
Well, he must have put up a fight, so we might get some touch DNA

08:57.688 --> 08:59.222
from the perp off the cubicle walls.

08:59.248 --> 09:02.744
Other than that, this key fob was in his pocket.

09:02.769 --> 09:04.663
That's it for now.

09:04.688 --> 09:06.073
W
w

09:07.327 --> 09:10.663
So, how was Clooney?
Loving that you call him that.

09:10.688 --> 09:12.793
And the road to the White House?

09:12.818 --> 09:16.182
Uphill, I think. Lots of schmoozing, raising funds, you know?

09:16.207 --> 09:19.943
Oh. Hiya. I've just remembered we've got those bloody auditors today.

09:19.969 --> 09:22.024
I'm going to cancel them - we've got a postmortem.

09:22.048 --> 09:24.264
You can't cancel now. They're already here.

09:24.288 --> 09:25.903
What?
I can do the postmortem.

09:25.928 --> 09:28.264
No, no, no. You've got a tonne of casework to get through.

09:28.288 --> 09:30.384
You want me to entertain them?

09:30.408 --> 09:32.302
Show them my spreadsheets.

09:32.327 --> 09:34.384
They'll love that.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.232
Thanks. I'll see them first.

09:40.048 --> 09:43.432
So you're telling me I have to justify every single test I order

09:43.457 --> 09:45.352
financially as well as clinically?

09:45.378 --> 09:48.024
If you're ordering tests the police haven't asked for,

09:48.048 --> 09:50.744
they won't pay for them, and the Lyell gets stuck with the bill.

09:50.769 --> 09:52.584
Look, it's not up to me to tie your hands,

09:52.609 --> 09:54.153
but if you want to stay in the black,

09:54.178 --> 09:55.584
you can't just order and order.

10:05.739 --> 10:09.182
Ragged marks on the edge of the wound suggest

10:09.207 --> 10:12.464
a possible serrated cutting edge to the bladed weapon.

10:12.489 --> 10:16.793
The wound itself is well executed, straight and deft.

10:16.818 --> 10:18.793
There's bruising to the side of his face,

10:18.818 --> 10:20.663
indicating a separate blunt-force impact,

10:20.688 --> 10:23.264
plus further bruising to his lower jaw.

10:24.327 --> 10:26.744
We also found...

10:26.769 --> 10:30.594
what looks like vomit in the stubble below his lower lip,

10:30.619 --> 10:33.823
and evidence of skin, possibly, under the fingernails.

10:33.849 --> 10:35.663
Come in.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.543
Anything on his ID yet?

10:39.568 --> 10:41.463
No. We're still working on it.

10:41.489 --> 10:43.182
I've got a few things that might help you.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.713
Quite a few, actually.

10:44.739 --> 10:48.352
Firstly, there's the facial bone structure, plus no prominent larynx.

10:48.378 --> 10:52.432
Also, he's had extensive surgery to his upper chest,

10:52.457 --> 10:53.874
likely double mastectomy,

10:53.899 --> 10:55.594
and a phalloplasty.

10:57.818 --> 10:58.994
He's transgender?

10:59.019 --> 10:59.994
Yeah.

11:41.236 --> 11:42.493
Hey!

11:42.518 --> 11:45.692
Hey. DI Murphy there still? I've found a wallet.

11:45.717 --> 11:47.211
She's in the PM.

11:47.236 --> 11:49.653
A bit of cash, no credit cards,

11:49.677 --> 11:51.722
but there's a gym membership. Photo and a name on it.

11:51.748 --> 11:53.412
I've e-mailed you an image.

11:53.437 --> 11:55.602
Yeah, I got it.

11:55.628 --> 11:56.972
Thanks, jack.

11:56.998 --> 11:59.003
Right. Bye.

11:59.028 --> 12:03.243
No. I just need the next of kin for Rico Abbey.

12:05.878 --> 12:07.442
What?

12:07.467 --> 12:11.211
Well, when he did his membership form, you'd...you'd get his name,

12:11.236 --> 12:13.773
his date of birth, his address and his next...

12:15.317 --> 12:18.722
Emergency contact? Yeah, that's it. Thank you.

12:18.748 --> 12:19.802
Can I get some paper?

12:19.827 --> 12:21.292
Give us a name?

12:22.717 --> 12:24.852
Alex Edwards.

12:26.356 --> 12:28.243
And relationship to...?

12:28.268 --> 12:29.773
Partner.

12:31.158 --> 12:32.653
Address?

12:34.158 --> 12:36.692
He came to London for a doctor called Viv Gordon.

12:38.388 --> 12:41.081
She was a specialist in the kind of surgery he wanted.

12:44.467 --> 12:47.412
We just fell for each other.

12:47.437 --> 12:48.572
It just happened.

12:51.077 --> 12:52.802
I never expected it, and...

12:58.106 --> 12:59.773
It's all right.

12:59.798 --> 13:01.572
Take your time, Alex, yeah?

13:03.628 --> 13:05.523
Can you tell me about yesterday?

13:09.356 --> 13:13.331
We left at about 9.30 and got a cab to the V&A.

13:13.356 --> 13:14.442
And then?

13:15.827 --> 13:18.523
And then I had a meeting at work, so I left him outside the station.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.052
Which station?

13:20.077 --> 13:21.243
South Ken.

13:24.398 --> 13:26.081
We're ready, if you are.

13:27.467 --> 13:28.442
You ready?

13:43.106 --> 13:44.572
Was he in pain?

13:44.597 --> 13:46.013
Was he frightened?

13:47.518 --> 13:51.572
I'm sorry. We're still trying to establish exactly what happened.

14:02.138 --> 14:03.712
Everybody loved him.

14:21.447 --> 14:24.503
Come on, squadron, quick march!

14:28.346 --> 14:33.533
Quick march! Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

14:33.888 --> 14:38.272
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

14:38.297 --> 14:41.783
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

14:41.807 --> 14:45.272
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left.

15:37.778 --> 15:38.832
Amy...

15:38.857 --> 15:40.352
Wait for...
Amy, hi.

15:40.378 --> 15:42.913
Amy, let me see the kids.
HL Daddy.

15:42.937 --> 15:44.913
Get inside.
Come on. Come on.

15:44.937 --> 15:47.152
Come on! Let me just speak to them for five minutes.

15:47.177 --> 15:48.633
Let me just see the kids! Come on!

15:48.658 --> 15:51.152
In the kitchen...
I just want to see the kids,

15:51.177 --> 15:53.503
just for five minutes. You can't do this!

15:55.096 --> 15:58.863
You know what I want to hear. What more do you want me to say?

15:58.888 --> 16:01.432
We need to talk. How are we ever going to sort this out

16:01.457 --> 16:03.192
if we don't just sit down and speak?

16:04.528 --> 16:05.942
I can't even look at you.

16:07.817 --> 16:08.913
Amy...

16:08.937 --> 16:10.043
Amy!

16:10.067 --> 16:12.402
Amy!

16:12.427 --> 16:13.582
Amy!

16:14.966 --> 16:16.863
Amy! Amy!

16:43.658 --> 16:45.222
Right, let's get started, shall we?

16:45.248 --> 16:48.043
It was a sudden attack.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.552
This impact to the side of his head

16:52.577 --> 16:55.152
could have happened when the cubicle door was bashed open

16:55.177 --> 16:57.123
and he was pushed to the side. If it did, he may

16:57.148 --> 17:00.633
well have been standing with his back to the cubicle door, vomiting.

17:00.658 --> 17:02.352
Do we have the tox?

17:02.378 --> 17:05.992
Routine tox came back normal, other than alcohol.

17:06.018 --> 17:09.583
105mg per 100ml.

17:09.607 --> 17:11.123
So over the limit, but...

17:11.146 --> 17:13.152
What about fingerprints on that wallet?

17:13.175 --> 17:15.303
There are some. Victim's only.

17:15.327 --> 17:17.992
Right. The wound itself...

17:18.018 --> 17:20.553
Clearly made with a blade of some kind.

17:20.577 --> 17:24.271
If the weapon was straight-edged, we'd expect sharp, clean margins

17:24.297 --> 17:26.482
but you can you see here they're coarse and irregular,

17:26.508 --> 17:28.833
and this area of fanning...

17:28.857 --> 17:31.712
Well, everything suggests a serrated blade.

17:31.738 --> 17:34.762
Jack, anything?
Yes, sir.

17:34.788 --> 17:36.512
Key fobs.

17:36.538 --> 17:38.512
Key fobs.

17:38.538 --> 17:42.833
So, we found this key fob on the victim.

17:42.857 --> 17:46.271
We traced the serial number to a charity called Transaction.

17:46.297 --> 17:48.432
It's for transgender people.

17:48.458 --> 17:51.192
Are we dealing with hate crime?

17:51.217 --> 17:53.152
Sorry! Sorry I'm late.

17:53.176 --> 17:54.712
Sorry to interrupt.

17:54.738 --> 17:57.072
Morning. Morning.
Hiya.

17:57.096 --> 17:59.152
I'm Acting DCI Martin Cramer.

17:59.176 --> 18:02.553
I've been given SIO on this, but I'm still playing catch-up,

18:02.577 --> 18:06.232
and Carey will be liaising with you guys, so don't let me interrupt.

18:08.617 --> 18:12.353
OK. I was going to ask about DNA profiling.

18:12.377 --> 18:13.913
Yeah, we've requested that.

18:13.938 --> 18:15.271
Did you get the sound file?

18:15.297 --> 18:16.482
You what?

18:16.508 --> 18:19.042
I asked for it to be e-mailed through to you.

18:19.067 --> 18:21.913
Sorry, there's me saying I won't interrupt,

18:21.938 --> 18:25.152
but we got a call from a helpline called Transaction.

18:25.176 --> 18:27.633
She received a call, and I'll play it to you.

18:27.657 --> 18:30.553
My name's Evie Williams.
I'm phoning from a helpline,

18:30.577 --> 18:31.913
a support line.

18:31.938 --> 18:35.302
Somebody's just called from a phone box on Regent Street.

18:35.327 --> 18:37.843
They said they're going to cut somebody's throat.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.232
A squad car went to investigate but there was nobody there.

18:40.258 --> 18:41.992
Anything on the phone box? Prints?

18:42.018 --> 18:44.951
Uniform didn't pursue it.
They just filed it under crank call.

18:44.977 --> 18:48.042
We're going to follow up that helpline lead and see what we get.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.302
OK, everybody. First things first.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.873
I just want to say a massive thank you

18:54.897 --> 18:57.123
from the bottom of our hearts.

18:57.147 --> 19:00.792
We've had over 20,000 calls this year alone

19:00.817 --> 19:03.604
and we couldn't have done it without you. Without Kelly,

19:03.628 --> 19:06.198
for all of the publicity you've spearheaded...

19:07.534 --> 19:12.659
...and all the lobbying that David's done, getting the Government onside,

19:12.864 --> 19:16.118
and all of the money that we've raised.

19:16.144 --> 19:19.308
You guys are incredible.

19:19.334 --> 19:20.909
We love you for it.

19:20.933 --> 19:23.838
I'm getting emotional, so let's get these lovely wealthy people in here

19:23.864 --> 19:26.479
and get their money pledged.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.868
Nikki, do you remember my old friend Susie Merrick?

19:30.894 --> 19:31.989
Erm...

19:32.013 --> 19:34.229
She's offered me a job.
What?

19:34.253 --> 19:36.147
Head of Faculty at UCL.

19:36.173 --> 19:39.118
You're not thinking of accepting it,
are you?
No. Course not.

19:39.144 --> 19:41.067
Have you said anything to jack and Clarissa?

19:41.093 --> 19:43.229
Well, there's nothing to say, is
there?
Well, so...

19:43.253 --> 19:44.989
Well, I don't know.

19:45.013 --> 19:47.118
Do you remember? My mum was a teacher.

19:48.453 --> 19:51.018
I've always fancied...
What, giving a Ted Talk?

19:51.042 --> 19:52.788
No.

19:52.814 --> 19:55.479
No, inspiring the next generation of pathologists.

19:55.503 --> 19:57.397
There is life outside the Lyell, you know?

19:57.423 --> 19:59.868
But you're not going to take it.
No, I'm not going to take it.

19:59.894 --> 20:01.509
OK. Good.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.709
Go and do some work.

20:15.423 --> 20:17.278
What are you doing here?

20:17.303 --> 20:18.838
Come to support you.

20:18.864 --> 20:20.588
What, in this place?

20:22.253 --> 20:23.868
I'm sorry, it's just...

20:25.374 --> 20:28.788
It's just you're the last person that I'd expect to see here.

20:30.943 --> 20:32.628
Are you well?

20:32.653 --> 20:34.229
Mm-hm.

20:34.253 --> 20:35.479
Are you haPPY?

20:36.614 --> 20:37.709
Are you clean?

20:38.894 --> 20:40.709
All of the above.

20:45.992 --> 20:48.778
Excuse me. I'm sorry, have you seen Evie?

20:48.804 --> 20:50.009
Um, no.

20:51.113 --> 20:52.298
Uh, please.

20:53.884 --> 20:55.939
Come on, let's go and have a cigarette.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.578
We can have a proper catch-up.

21:00.884 --> 21:04.328
So, the helpline is solely for trans people, is it?

21:04.354 --> 21:07.298
People thinking about changing their gender identity

21:07.323 --> 21:09.417
and their friends and their family.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.689
It's been good. People are using it.

21:13.044 --> 21:14.939
Um...

21:14.963 --> 21:18.087
Do you recognise this?

21:19.713 --> 21:22.528
Yeah, it's what we use to get in our security door.

21:22.554 --> 21:24.808
So the volunteers have one of these, do they?

21:24.834 --> 21:27.328
So they can get into the duty room for when people phone in.

21:29.753 --> 21:34.249
Er, I just... I want to play you this. Jog your memory, you know.

21:34.273 --> 21:36.528
"460932.

21:36.554 --> 21:40.417
My name's Evie Williams. I'm phoning from a helpline, a support line.

21:40.442 --> 21:43.449
Somebody's just called from a phone box on Regent Street.

21:43.473 --> 21:45.939
They said they're going to cut somebody's throat.

21:45.963 --> 21:48.378
I've still got them on here now on another line.

21:48.403 --> 21:50.608
Stay with me. I'm going to send a unit there now.

21:51.884 --> 21:55.087
Did you take that call yourself?
Yeah.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.939
Can you tell me what the voice sounded like?

21:57.963 --> 22:00.729
I don't know. It was, like, muffled.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.409
Male, female?

22:02.433 --> 22:04.378
Like I said, I don't know.

22:04.403 --> 22:06.808
We try not to make assumptions here.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.378
Why did they call here?
Um...

22:15.163 --> 22:17.858
It's a trans victim, isn't it?

22:17.884 --> 22:20.167
Do you recognise this man?

22:20.192 --> 22:21.608
Oh, my God.

22:24.273 --> 22:25.659
Was he a volunteer here?

24:25.273 --> 24:28.378
Hello, Transaction. How may I help?

24:28.403 --> 24:30.858
Please don't say
anything-

24:30.884 --> 24:32.048
Don't...

24:32.073 --> 24:33.739
Don't...don't speak.

24:35.323 --> 24:38.499
I've been thinking about what to say for a long time.

24:41.403 --> 24:44.378
So just...listen.

24:46.844 --> 24:49.578
I just went out in the street...

24:50.713 --> 24:52.019
...in public...

24:53.123 --> 24:55.939
...dressed as I want to be for the first time.

24:58.483 --> 25:03.578
The rest of the time I'm stuck in a kind of...limbo.

25:05.073 --> 25:07.968
I can't be who I am.

25:09.523 --> 25:13.218
There's a woman inside of me that is desperate to get out.

25:14.884 --> 25:16.409
Do you know what I'm saying?

25:17.963 --> 25:19.378
She's my...

25:20.713 --> 25:22.608
...ego.

25:22.634 --> 25:24.739
My id, my spirit,

25:24.763 --> 25:25.968
my essence.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.499
She's everything. Everything.

25:28.523 --> 25:31.298
It's who I am.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.608
Hello. Police emergency. What's your name, please?

25:46.634 --> 25:47.898
Maeve Williams.

25:49.323 --> 25:52.409
There's blood in my daughter's bathroom.

25:52.433 --> 25:54.499
And she's not answering her phone.

25:55.713 --> 25:58.769
Her bag's here, so she must've been here.

25:58.794 --> 26:00.178
And someone else.

26:00.202 --> 26:03.298
Can you tell me, is there an intruder in the house right now?

26:03.323 --> 26:05.128
Firm, no..

26:05.153 --> 26:06.328
I-I don't think so.

26:06.354 --> 26:08.409
All right, Maeve. A squad car's on its way to you.

26:08.433 --> 26:09.538
Stay on the phone with me.

26:11.242 --> 26:13.178
No body?

26:13.202 --> 26:15.019
So, where is she?

26:15.044 --> 26:16.739
Reeks of vomit in here.

26:16.763 --> 26:18.968
There's bloody fingermarks in the basin.

26:18.992 --> 26:20.898
Probably Evie's.

26:20.923 --> 26:23.509
She was vomiting into the toilet, hunched over,

26:23.534 --> 26:25.818
with her back to the door as the attacker approached.

26:25.844 --> 26:27.378
There's a scuffle.

26:27.403 --> 26:29.689
Evie gets cut.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.968
Maybe?

26:30.992 --> 26:32.298
Somebody slipped -

26:32.323 --> 26:34.509
it's more likely to be the attacker -

26:34.534 --> 26:38.538
allowing Evie to get away. I'm going to check that for fingerprints.

26:38.564 --> 26:42.818
She came out the bathroom, grabbed the phone, maybe to call for help.

26:42.844 --> 26:45.659
Maybe...maybe she threw it at them.

26:45.683 --> 26:47.509
Blood trail here - all the way,

26:47.534 --> 26:49.618
all the way, all the way out the door.

26:49.644 --> 26:50.939
Oh, she buzzed them in!

26:52.202 --> 26:54.328
Possibly knew them. Just saying. Come on. Keep up.

26:56.044 --> 26:58.259
Blood trail. Blood trail.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.128
Blood trail. Blood trail. Blood trail.

27:01.153 --> 27:03.509
Stops here. OK?

27:03.534 --> 27:05.178
We've got a tyre mark.

27:05.202 --> 27:08.409
We've got a footwear mark. I'm suggesting the attacker comes out,

27:08.433 --> 27:11.868
catches up with her, picks her up, chucks her in a car, drives off.

27:11.894 --> 27:13.769
That's impressive.

27:13.794 --> 27:15.659
We'll do a door-to-door

27:15.683 --> 27:18.378
and get a press and online appeal for information out there.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.259
Maybe somebody saw something.
Hope so.

27:36.323 --> 27:40.097
Evie's been on television and radio a few times, hasn't she?

27:40.123 --> 27:41.298
Was she...?

27:42.564 --> 27:46.538
Did she ever receive any hate mail or e-mails or...?

27:46.564 --> 27:48.298
Yes, of course.

27:48.323 --> 27:51.228
People are frightened by what they don't know.

27:51.252 --> 27:52.868
People like...?

27:52.894 --> 27:55.689
Far-right groups, religious groups.

27:55.713 --> 27:56.978
Some feminists.

27:58.284 --> 28:00.378
Can I ask, was Evie in a relationship?

28:00.403 --> 28:01.868
Ya

28:01.894 --> 28:04.618
How can you be so sure?

28:04.644 --> 28:06.378
Because we're close.

28:06.403 --> 28:07.769
Always have been.

28:08.963 --> 28:10.659
If there was someone, she would tell me.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.048
This is hers, right?

28:18.089 --> 28:23.122
Just one more thing. Where were you, both of you, this afternoon?

28:25.636 --> 28:27.682
We were having lunch with friends.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.971
At their place.
All day?

28:29.996 --> 28:32.692
No. I went for a walk for a bit.

28:34.507 --> 28:35.652
OK.

28:35.676 --> 28:37.372
Thank you.

28:46.396 --> 28:49.122
Double-check times and places, OK?

28:49.146 --> 28:51.040
For both of them. Oh, and the fingerprints.

28:51.066 --> 28:52.251
RE

29:02.557 --> 29:04.761
Um, can I just say something, or am I interrupting?

29:04.787 --> 29:07.122
No, no, go ahead.

29:08.636 --> 29:11.372
You all right?
No. Not really.

29:13.195 --> 29:14.612
None of us are.

29:16.757 --> 29:19.811
Look, I saw your appeal for information about Evie.

29:19.836 --> 29:21.531
Did anyone come forward?

29:21.557 --> 29:24.122
Sorry. I can't give you that information. Not at the moment.

29:24.146 --> 29:25.221
You understand, right?

29:26.717 --> 29:29.090
I don't know if this is relevant,

29:29.115 --> 29:31.862
but there were lots of people in here -

29:31.886 --> 29:33.942
in Evie's office - when we had the fundraiser.

29:33.967 --> 29:36.971
What people?
All kinds of people.

29:36.996 --> 29:39.481
Coming in and out, poking around.

29:39.507 --> 29:42.221
Look, I don't know if that's helpful, but it's her stuff,

29:42.246 --> 29:46.300
so I just thought I should tell you everything while I remember.

29:46.326 --> 29:48.251
Thank you.

29:48.277 --> 29:49.451
OK.

30:15.195 --> 30:16.840
jack, have you got something for me?

30:16.865 --> 30:18.612
Yeah. Another possible entry point.

30:18.636 --> 30:21.731
Somebody's tried to force a window, giving us another fingerprint.

30:21.757 --> 30:23.332
OK.

30:24.507 --> 30:27.221
And they've left this behind, haven't they?

30:27.246 --> 30:29.090
Hair strand.

30:31.557 --> 30:34.171
The assailant's?
Could be.

31:03.246 --> 31:05.612
Can I have some help, please?

31:17.195 --> 31:18.251
Thomas Chamberlain.

31:18.277 --> 31:21.531
Hi, yeah. Cramer here. Now, we may have another victim.

31:21.557 --> 31:24.021
Not trans this time, but she was coming out of Transaction.

31:24.047 --> 31:25.942
OK. Where do you want us?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.531
No, no, no, she's still alive.
Oh.

31:28.557 --> 31:30.412
So you may have a witness.

31:30.436 --> 31:33.144
Yeah. She took herself into A&E.

31:33.170 --> 31:35.362
Very nasty wounds to her arms.

31:35.386 --> 31:37.001
We're about to head there now.

31:37.027 --> 31:39.030
Photographs have been taken.

31:39.056 --> 31:41.112
I've forwarded them to you.
All right.

31:43.457 --> 31:45.362
Yeah. Got them. OK.

31:45.386 --> 31:48.231
I'll have a look and get back to you. Yeah? Thanks, bye.

31:54.136 --> 31:55.511
Amy.

31:55.537 --> 31:57.951
Amy, it's me. Let me in.

32:03.896 --> 32:05.280
Amy?

32:09.027 --> 32:10.280
Amy...

32:12.136 --> 32:15.511
Amy, we need to speak. Let me in, darling, please.

32:15.537 --> 32:17.432
Come on, it's freezing.

32:17.457 --> 32:18.872
Please, Amy.

32:20.336 --> 32:22.112
Please just open the door.

32:23.855 --> 32:26.830
Just open the door. Amy, please just open the...

32:35.175 --> 32:36.672
Sorry.

32:42.105 --> 32:43.721
Can I come in?

32:48.027 --> 32:49.642
I don't know.

32:54.947 --> 32:56.561
I miss you so much.

33:27.747 --> 33:29.872
What about your parents?

33:29.896 --> 33:32.471
Well, Dad found it quite tough at first, obviously.

33:32.497 --> 33:33.801
I've got him onside now.

33:33.826 --> 33:36.561
In fact, I'm still trying to shake him off...

33:36.586 --> 33:39.801
Nothing untoward re the prints in the bathroom.

33:39.826 --> 33:41.592
They're all either Evie's or her parents'.

33:41.616 --> 33:44.511
However, there is an interesting one on the pendant.

33:44.537 --> 33:46.280
You've run that through the database?

33:46.306 --> 33:48.112
So, we need your money...

33:48.136 --> 33:49.872
Literally what's happening right here.

33:49.896 --> 33:53.001
Evie Williams from
Transaction...
There's no match yet.

33:55.467 --> 33:58.751
You don't fancy women now, do you?

34:03.105 --> 34:05.280
Evie Williams told me this thing -

34:05.306 --> 34:08.030
that gender is who you go to bed as.

34:09.666 --> 34:11.951
Sexuality's who you go to bed with.

34:16.976 --> 34:19.231
I want to go to bed with you.

34:22.666 --> 34:24.521
Well, you're not going to.

34:26.467 --> 34:30.951
Can't you just role-play Nick Marlow for the rest of your life?

34:30.976 --> 34:32.672
We could pretend.

34:38.827 --> 34:41.112
Except that's what you did.

34:41.137 --> 34:44.802
Not everything. I didn't pretend everything.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.882
Do you know what this feels like?

34:55.056 --> 34:57.311
It's like you've had an affair with another woman...

34:58.907 --> 35:00.882
...but that woman is you.

35:02.907 --> 35:07.280
And affairs make people... very, very selfish.

35:10.416 --> 35:12.472
They just think about themselves.

35:15.827 --> 35:19.030
Right, then. This is Beth Roscoe. The surviving victim.

35:19.056 --> 35:20.641
Same attacker?

35:20.666 --> 35:22.161
I think it could be, yeah.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.472
Hmm.

35:23.496 --> 35:25.311
Deep slash wounds.

35:26.467 --> 35:28.472
Possibly defensive?
Mm-hm.

35:28.496 --> 35:31.280
The same ragged edges as the Rico Abbey wounds?

35:31.306 --> 35:34.391
Hard to tell without seeing her in person, isn't it?

35:34.416 --> 35:39.280
The fingerprint from the Williams' window is a match

35:39.306 --> 35:41.001
with a guy called Toby Logan.

35:41.027 --> 35:44.552
The hair - well, without the hair root I can't extract DNA,

35:44.577 --> 35:47.280
but judging by the hair shaft, the colour's a match.

35:47.306 --> 35:51.951
And the print on the pendant Evie was wearing is a match

35:51.976 --> 35:53.722
with this guy, Nick Marlow.

35:53.746 --> 35:56.565
Arrested in '04 for being drunk and disorderly.

35:56.590 --> 35:58.184
Two strong leads.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.594
Nice work.

35:59.619 --> 36:01.943
Right, we need to get these over to Cramer and Murphy.

36:01.967 --> 36:04.233
They're interviewing a possible witness now.

36:06.768 --> 36:11.554
People were talking about an attack that happened.

36:12.967 --> 36:15.434
Is this that...? Is this that guy?

36:16.938 --> 36:19.664
It's possible that leaving Transaction

36:19.688 --> 36:21.822
was enough to make you a target.

36:23.259 --> 36:25.822
You think he's got something against the helpline?

36:25.847 --> 36:28.902
You just take it easy. It's all right.

36:28.927 --> 36:30.543
Look, before I answer that,

36:30.568 --> 36:32.952
can I ask you about his voice? Did he speak?

36:34.458 --> 36:36.463
And the knife? Can you describe that?

36:36.489 --> 36:37.664
It was...

36:37.688 --> 36:39.793
It was a knife...a knife, you know?

36:39.818 --> 36:41.594
Yeah, but just...how big?

36:43.128 --> 36:44.873
L...l don't know.

36:44.898 --> 36:47.514
He...he grabbed me first from behind.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.233
L...l thought there was someone coming...

36:50.259 --> 36:52.233
Do you think that's why he left you alone?

36:52.259 --> 36:54.543
Yeah.
Yeah.

36:54.568 --> 36:58.023
You told the uniformed officers,

36:58.047 --> 37:00.103
the ones who interviewed you first,

37:00.128 --> 37:02.463
you gave them a description of your attacker.

37:02.489 --> 37:04.434
Could you do that again for me, please?

37:06.378 --> 37:07.664
Firm, yeah..

37:08.847 --> 37:12.744
He had a...long dark coat...

37:12.768 --> 37:14.313
Er...

37:14.338 --> 37:17.764
boots, like big, working boots...

37:19.358 --> 37:21.043
...a black beanie.

37:22.398 --> 37:27.014
Not very tall. Like 5' 8", 5' 9".

37:27.039 --> 37:28.693
Was he white? Black?

37:28.719 --> 37:30.403
White.

37:30.429 --> 37:33.563
I'm going to have to ask you to come down the station, if that's OK.

38:36.197 --> 38:37.373
Police! Stop!

38:37.398 --> 38:39.052
Put your arms behind your back.
OK.

38:40.228 --> 38:42.373
Nick Marlow?
Hey, hey...

38:42.398 --> 38:45.612
Hey, whoa, whoa! I've not done
anything!
...suspicion of murder.

38:45.637 --> 38:48.123
Toby Logan, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.

38:48.148 --> 38:50.563
Agh! Agh, that's tight!
Calm down, sir.

38:50.588 --> 38:52.663
What's going on? I've not done anything.

38:52.688 --> 38:55.202
Anything you do say may be given in evidence. Do you understand?

38:55.228 --> 38:56.413
Yes.
Get him out of here.

39:15.507 --> 39:16.693
Professor Chamberlain.

39:16.717 --> 39:19.282
I'm a pathologist. I need to run a few tests,

39:19.307 --> 39:21.693
just to cross-check with what we've got on file.

39:21.717 --> 39:23.483
I'll also need to take swabs.

39:24.838 --> 39:27.413
Could I ask you to remove your clothing, please?

39:27.438 --> 39:29.413
Hand each item to me one at a time.

39:32.117 --> 39:33.893
Start with your footwear.

40:19.557 --> 40:20.773
Here you are.

40:20.797 --> 40:22.132
Put this on.

40:36.588 --> 40:38.813
We need to take a swab. DNA.

40:38.838 --> 40:40.452
Open, please.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.282
Thank you.

40:51.876 --> 40:54.693
What gender pronouns are you going to use for me in your report?

40:58.478 --> 40:59.693
What would you like me to use?

41:01.876 --> 41:03.101
She.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.282
Please.

41:06.918 --> 41:08.023
She.

41:14.918 --> 41:17.972
I work in a bank.
As a cashier?

41:19.358 --> 41:22.253
I'm Business Affairs Manager, actually.

41:22.277 --> 41:23.813
So, what do you do at Transaction?

41:23.838 --> 41:26.851
I hear about people with money

41:26.876 --> 41:29.382
who are looking for charities to support,

41:29.407 --> 41:30.693
so I introduce them to Evie.

41:32.518 --> 41:37.052
I'm not trans myself.
Did you know that?
Yeah.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.643
But I have family who are.

41:38.668 --> 41:42.213
Military tolerant, are they, of trans people?

41:44.077 --> 41:46.492
With the Army, you get what it says on the tin,

41:46.518 --> 41:48.132
and if it says tolerant and inclusive,

41:48.157 --> 41:50.463
it's because they're tolerant and inclusive.

41:50.487 --> 41:51.972
And you've told your colleagues,

41:51.996 --> 41:53.813
have you, that you think of yourself as a woman?

41:55.637 --> 41:57.563
Why is this relevant?
You do, though, don't you?

41:57.588 --> 41:59.463
Think of yourself as a woman?

42:02.197 --> 42:03.282
Yes.

42:04.918 --> 42:08.253
Even though you've got the body and the life experience of a man?

42:10.876 --> 42:11.851
Yes.

42:12.996 --> 42:15.172
So, how well do you know Evie Williams?

42:15.197 --> 42:16.742
A little.

42:16.768 --> 42:18.492
When was the last time you saw her, then?

42:18.518 --> 42:20.333
At the fundraiser.

42:20.358 --> 42:22.382
Tell us about Evie Williams.

42:22.407 --> 42:24.052
She, um...

42:25.407 --> 42:27.213
She-she saved my life.

42:27.237 --> 42:29.822
Or the helpline did.

42:29.847 --> 42:31.181
Where's this going?

42:31.206 --> 42:32.742
Did you leave the fundraiser

42:32.768 --> 42:34.742
before or after her?
Um...

42:34.768 --> 42:37.181
Before or after?
Before.

42:37.206 --> 42:39.253
After that, what did you do?

42:39.277 --> 42:42.333
I went back to work and then I went home.

42:42.358 --> 42:45.181
So where is Evie now?
How would I know that?

42:45.206 --> 42:47.052
And where is she?
I don't know.

42:47.077 --> 42:48.572
Where is she?
I don't know.

42:48.597 --> 42:50.572
Why am I being subjected to this?

42:50.597 --> 42:53.101
Your fingerprint was found on a window where she lives,

42:53.126 --> 42:55.413
so we thought maybe you'd seen her.

42:55.438 --> 42:57.101
Well, I've never been in that apartment.

42:57.126 --> 42:59.132
But you've been outside it? When?

43:00.438 --> 43:01.773
I don't know.

43:01.797 --> 43:03.333
We found an item at Evie Williams'

43:03.358 --> 43:05.253
home address with your fingerprint on it.

43:05.277 --> 43:07.463
What item?
How did it get there?

43:07.487 --> 43:09.463
How do I know unless I know what item?

43:21.996 --> 43:23.931
I ran the cloakroom at the fundraiser.

43:23.956 --> 43:25.893
I helped her out of her coat.

43:25.918 --> 43:27.693
Maybe that's how it got there.

43:27.717 --> 43:32.213
I went there a couple of clays ago to drop off some information

43:32.237 --> 43:35.972
about someone who wanted to support the charity.

43:35.996 --> 43:37.293
She wasn't in.

43:37.318 --> 43:39.052
So, what, you thought you'd try the windows?

43:40.996 --> 43:42.851
I looked inside, yes.

43:44.407 --> 43:46.543
Thought maybe she didn't hear the bell.

43:52.318 --> 43:54.931
I mean, does Marlow really think that changing his gender

43:54.956 --> 43:56.822
is going to solve all his
problems?
Well, I...

43:56.847 --> 43:59.742
I think it's more fundamental than solving any old problem, don't you?

43:59.768 --> 44:02.463
Yeah, well, if he tries to use gender dysphoria or mental illness

44:02.487 --> 44:04.822
or whatever to get off...

44:04.847 --> 44:08.293
Being trans is not an illness. Look, we'll process the DNA samples

44:08.318 --> 44:11.052
and the fingerprints. We'll get straight back to you.

44:11.077 --> 44:14.132
Terrific. Thanks.
So, you think Marlow's guilty?

44:14.157 --> 44:16.293
Depends if his story checks out.

44:19.518 --> 44:21.293
Depends if her story checks out,

44:21.318 --> 44:23.382
which, let's face it, it might well do.

44:23.407 --> 44:25.293
Let's get to it, yeah?

44:31.876 --> 44:33.293
Sir.

44:34.717 --> 44:37.293
Do you want to check downstairs?
Yeah, sure.

45:20.748 --> 45:22.393
I
Yes, ma'am.

45:25.018 --> 45:28.032
Will you bike this over to the Lyell for me?

45:28.056 --> 45:29.472
Right away, ma'am.

46:04.498 --> 46:05.753
Hello.

46:05.777 --> 46:06.961
Hiya. Cramer here.

46:06.987 --> 46:08.632
You got anything for me?

46:08.657 --> 46:10.992
Yeah. The hair strand from Evie

46:11.018 --> 46:13.802
is a colour match with the sample we took from Toby Logan.

46:13.827 --> 46:16.882
Great. We've sent you a knife we found in his boat.

46:16.907 --> 46:18.831
Could you compare it with the victim's wounds?

46:18.856 --> 46:20.472
Yeah, we'll get on to that.

46:20.498 --> 46:22.552
So, what's outstanding on Marlow? Anything?

46:22.577 --> 46:24.242
Nothing forensically to link him

46:24.268 --> 46:26.831
to the crime scenes, apart from that fingerprint on the pendant.

46:26.856 --> 46:28.472
OK. Thanks.

46:29.628 --> 46:30.711
Thank you.

46:35.657 --> 46:37.831
Right, so there's nothing to hold him on, then.

46:37.856 --> 46:41.353
Let's bail Marlow.
Are you sure, guv?

46:41.378 --> 46:43.711
Yes, we have got our prime suspect.

46:50.347 --> 46:52.523
Do you like Russian dolls, Mr Logan?

47:05.297 --> 47:06.753
This is Logan's knife.

47:06.777 --> 47:08.242
A heavy-duty sailing knife.

47:08.268 --> 47:11.161
15mm serrated rope blade.

47:11.186 --> 47:13.961
Nikki, have you got the postmortem photographs

47:13.987 --> 47:15.552
of Rico Abbey?
Mm-hm.

47:15.577 --> 47:18.242
Jack, can you get me in tighter on that blade?

47:21.018 --> 47:22.472
Perfect.

47:22.498 --> 47:23.882
Thank you.

47:26.347 --> 47:27.523
Right.

47:28.737 --> 47:32.831
The spacing between the serrations might correlate.

47:32.856 --> 47:36.603
The depth...I'm not so sure.

47:36.628 --> 47:38.472
So, what can we say?

47:38.498 --> 47:41.711
All we can say with certainty is that the knife that killed

47:41.737 --> 47:45.041
Rico Abbey was serrated, and Toby Logan's got a serrated knife.

47:45.067 --> 47:46.711
So do millions of other people.

47:53.297 --> 47:54.911
You should sue them.

47:57.427 --> 48:00.322
They treated me OK.
They arrested you!

48:00.347 --> 48:02.711
They had their reasons.

48:02.737 --> 48:04.552
It's fine. It's over.

48:10.378 --> 48:12.523
Something that policeman said.

48:14.547 --> 48:17.443
How can I think of myself as a woman

48:17.467 --> 48:20.273
when I've got the body and experience of a man?

48:20.297 --> 48:21.961
Did you tell him to piss off?

48:21.987 --> 48:24.992
He's got a point, though, hasn't he?

48:25.018 --> 48:28.161
People say stuff, and do you face them down? No.

48:30.347 --> 48:33.353
You hate yourself just a little bit
MOVE.
I don't hate myself, Kelly.

48:33.378 --> 48:35.831
I hate...this situation.

48:35.856 --> 48:37.322
Feeling like this.

48:39.987 --> 48:42.273
I know I say I've always felt like a woman

48:42.297 --> 48:45.273
but I don't know how that actually feels, really.

48:46.737 --> 48:49.443
Do you feel like a woman or a man?

48:49.467 --> 48:50.911
That's the same for anybody.

48:52.657 --> 48:55.472
Whoever you are, you can only feel like yourself.

48:55.498 --> 48:58.472
You can't presume to know what that's like for anyone else,

48:58.498 --> 48:59.632
trans or no.

49:01.217 --> 49:02.831
Come on.

49:02.856 --> 49:05.831
Let's go back to yours, get you out of this,

49:05.856 --> 49:08.322
and then we're going to go see David Stein.

49:08.347 --> 49:10.041
David Stein? Why?

49:10.067 --> 49:11.682
He's in politics, isn't he?

49:13.217 --> 49:16.273
He's a lobbyist for bloody health care.

49:16.297 --> 49:19.882
Whatever! He's got contacts in the police. That'll do.

49:19.907 --> 49:22.603
No, no, no. I'm staying at home tonight.

49:22.628 --> 49:25.242
Sitting there brooding on your own? I don't think so.

49:27.788 --> 49:28.961
Come on.

50:17.677 --> 50:20.373
I think we need to look again at the toxicology on this.

50:20.398 --> 50:21.503
Why?

50:21.527 --> 50:23.902
The police asked for routine testing. Nothing else added.

50:23.927 --> 50:25.822
I know, but I've just been watching the CCTV.

50:25.847 --> 50:29.012
So, Rico Abbey is unsteady on his feet, plus he vomited.

50:29.038 --> 50:30.862
Possibly due to alcohol.

50:30.887 --> 50:33.342
Precisely. But Evie Williams hadn't been drinking.

50:33.367 --> 50:37.262
Not according to witnesses, no.
And she was sick too.

50:37.288 --> 50:39.981
Maybe it wasn't just alcohol that caused Rico problems.

50:40.007 --> 50:45.248
Let's add GHB, NPS and fentanyl derivatives to the tox test.

50:45.626 --> 50:48.271
And, er, who'll pay for it?
I'll deal with that.

50:48.295 --> 50:50.880
Oh, and test Marlow and Logan's clothing too. For transference.

50:50.905 --> 50:52.240
All right.

51:02.505 --> 51:06.960
I have it on reliable authority that the police have another suspect.

51:06.985 --> 51:09.400
Toby Logan.
Toby Logan?

51:09.425 --> 51:11.159
There's no way.

51:11.184 --> 51:15.521
That's what they're saying. And there's been another attack too.

51:15.545 --> 51:17.681
They won't say anything about that.

51:17.706 --> 51:20.400
Anyway, the priority is Evie.

51:20.425 --> 51:21.681
Finding her...

51:22.934 --> 51:25.159
Holding Cramer's feet to the fire.

52:01.505 --> 52:05.630
Can you send me them through, please? Right away, if you can.

52:05.655 --> 52:07.240
Right, thank you.

52:07.266 --> 52:08.561
Thomas?

52:08.585 --> 52:10.400
Coming.

52:13.376 --> 52:14.760
Well, good call.

52:14.786 --> 52:16.351
That was the lab.

52:16.376 --> 52:20.039
Rico Abbey had GHB in his system.

52:20.065 --> 52:22.351
Above the natural level produced postmortem?

52:22.376 --> 52:26.351
Significantly - at 180mg per litre of urine.

52:26.376 --> 52:30.351
Right, which is why he looked so disorientated on the CCTV.

52:30.376 --> 52:32.530
He wasn't just drunk, he'd taken drugs.

52:32.556 --> 52:34.351
Or he'd had them given to him.

52:34.376 --> 52:38.121
Yeah, but there were no signs of sexual assault, so why spike him?

52:38.146 --> 52:40.990
Maybe to weaken him - make it easier for his assailant.

52:41.016 --> 52:43.760
Also, the attacker could protect themselves. With that quantity,

52:43.786 --> 52:45.840
if the attack failed, then Rico wouldn't be able

52:45.864 --> 52:47.710
to remember anything, would he?
No.

52:47.735 --> 52:49.990
Like Rohypnol, it would be a blank.

52:50.016 --> 52:53.760
It's possible he took it recreationally. it's...a thing.

52:53.786 --> 52:54.960
I've got something.

52:56.666 --> 52:58.280
Powdered GHB -

52:58.306 --> 53:01.431
jacket belonging to a suspect.
Logan?

53:02.916 --> 53:05.351
Marlow?
Marlow.

53:05.376 --> 53:07.710
Well, that justifies the expense.

53:07.735 --> 53:09.351
Nice.

53:09.376 --> 53:10.840
I'll call Cramer.

53:16.864 --> 53:19.170
Cramer!
Hi, Thomas Chamberlain here.

53:19.195 --> 53:21.280
We've had some further toxicology back

53:21.306 --> 53:23.710
that changes the picture somewhat.
OK.

53:23.735 --> 53:26.789
Rico Abbey had a significant quantity of GHB in his system.

53:26.815 --> 53:28.121
OK.

53:28.146 --> 53:30.251
We've also found it on an item of clothing

53:30.275 --> 53:32.280
that Marlow was wearing when he was arrested.

53:32.306 --> 53:34.710
Marlow? Are you sure?

53:34.735 --> 53:36.400
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

53:38.306 --> 53:39.481
OK.

53:39.505 --> 53:40.641
Ole. Bye.

53:47.275 --> 53:49.201
The
Where's Marlow?

53:49.226 --> 53:50.960
Has he been released yet?

53:50.985 --> 53:53.121
Yeah, like you said - a couple of hours ago.

53:53.146 --> 53:54.481
Well, get him back here.

53:54.505 --> 53:56.561
Get to his barracks and his wife's house.

53:56.585 --> 53:59.070
Issue an all-cars and all-ports.
The

53:59.096 --> 54:00.610
Get him back now!

54:01.985 --> 54:03.561
Shit. Shit, shit!

54:07.815 --> 54:09.170
I'm going to go.

54:10.706 --> 54:12.400
Not to Amy's again.

54:12.425 --> 54:14.070
No.

54:14.096 --> 54:15.251
Promise?

54:18.556 --> 54:21.280
Look, you've just got to give her a bit of time, yeah?

54:21.306 --> 54:23.719
You haven't come to terms with yourself yet,

54:23.744 --> 54:27.400
so how come you expect her to just accept it straight away?

54:27.425 --> 54:30.530
Babe, I know what it's like to be you.

54:33.706 --> 54:36.481
I really hurt someone that I loved, you know that.

54:38.456 --> 54:40.610
I have to live with that every day.

54:40.635 --> 54:43.530
So don't make the same mistakes that I made.

54:43.556 --> 54:45.840
Go easy on yourself.

54:45.864 --> 54:47.561
And on her.

54:49.195 --> 54:50.431
Small steps.

54:55.356 --> 54:56.641
Thanks.

56:45.715 --> 56:46.760
Hi.

56:46.786 --> 56:49.719
Amy, there's something I want to say to you.

56:49.744 --> 56:51.610
Are you listening?

56:51.635 --> 56:52.641
Yeah.

56:54.465 --> 56:58.641
I have been a bad person

56:58.666 --> 57:00.331
and I've made you suffer.

57:00.356 --> 57:02.251
Where are you?

57:02.275 --> 57:04.481
I love you, Amy.

57:04.505 --> 57:07.840
I'm going to do my best to drive this out of me.

57:07.864 --> 57:09.641
Everything I can. Do you hear?

57:09.666 --> 57:12.920
So we'll see, yeah?

57:14.585 --> 57:16.411
Ames?

57:16.436 --> 57:17.840
Yeah.

57:17.864 --> 57:19.201
We'll see.
