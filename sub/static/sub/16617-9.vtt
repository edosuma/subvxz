get to the bottom,
the butt,

02:04.225 --> 02:06.325
of the situation.

02:06.327 --> 02:07.459
Uh, Melissa?

Uh, Melissa,
Melissa.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.830
How many fingers

02:11.832 --> 02:13.098
am I holding up?

02:13.100 --> 02:15.767

02:15.769 --> 02:18.437
No, it was three.

didn't even say a number.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.407
TODD: Guys, look,

02:22.409 --> 02:23.742
Melissa's exhausted.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.010
Why don't we try to

02:25.012 --> 02:26.345
just let her get some rest,

02:26.347 --> 02:28.514
then figure this thing out
in the morning?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.682
Yeah, but, Todd, what if
she wanders off again?

02:30.684 --> 02:32.417
She's a danger to herself,
and maybe to us.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.153
We can't just let her
roam around here.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.587
Well, what are we gonna do, huh?

02:35.589 --> 02:37.156
Tie her up, put her in stocks?

02:37.158 --> 02:40.359
No. I don't know.
I mean, maybe.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.660
Yeah, I think
we should tie her up.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.328
We could lock her
in that focus-group room

02:43.330 --> 02:44.363
with the two-way mirror,

02:44.365 --> 02:45.697
keep an eye on her
from in there.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.466
But she's not a zoo animal!

02:47.468 --> 02:50.536
Okay? When we accused her
of being crazy, she ran away.

02:50.538 --> 02:55.140
So maybe we treat her
like a person this time.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.109
I think this is
a mistake.

02:57.111 --> 02:58.143
Yeah, well, don't worry
about it, all right?

02:58.145 --> 02:59.144
'Cause I'm taking care of her.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.145
Melissa, hey.

03:00.147 --> 03:02.281
Want to go for

03:14.328 --> 03:16.662
Paper shredder.
Paper shredder?

03:16.664 --> 03:18.297
I hardly knew her.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.566

03:20.568 --> 03:22.534
Oh...

03:24.337 --> 03:25.504
What are you shredding?

03:25.506 --> 03:27.639
Oh, my adoption papers.

03:27.641 --> 03:29.675
What? No, no, no!
Good-bye cover letter.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.843
No, no, no, no.
Carol. Carol!

03:31.845 --> 03:33.879
No, no, no, no.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.416
No, no, no.
No, stop, stop, stop.

03:38.518 --> 03:40.819
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

03:40.821 --> 03:42.754
Because it's a bunch
of phony pepperoni.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.656
Baloney?
Oh, I'm not hungry.

03:44.658 --> 03:47.859
Look, Todd gave me
a wake-up call.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.162
I have been living in a
world of make-believe.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.197
I mean, calling Gail "Mom"?

03:52.199 --> 03:54.166
She's not really
my mom.

03:54.168 --> 03:56.268
You can't force someone
to be your family.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.903
Who does that?
Hey, Carol,

03:57.905 --> 03:59.338
the day you forced me
to marry you

03:59.340 --> 04:01.740
was the best day
of my life.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.942
Okay, stop it.
No, look.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.877
Uh, as I recall,

04:05.879 --> 04:08.614
we never went on a honeymoon,
did we, huh?

04:08.616 --> 04:09.881
What do you say?

04:09.883 --> 04:12.184
Tandy, I'm not
in the mood.

04:12.186 --> 04:15.020
Hey, let me tell you
a little story.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.723
There was once
this woman named Stella,

04:17.725 --> 04:21.727
and she just had this tremendous
amount of groove, right?

04:21.729 --> 04:24.029
But then one day, for reasons
unbeknownst to me--

04:24.031 --> 04:25.797
I never saw the movie,
it was based on a movie--

04:25.799 --> 04:29.234
uh, she lost it--
it just was gone, right?

04:29.236 --> 04:31.703
But then somehow--
again, I don't know how;

04:31.705 --> 04:33.205
I did not see this movie--

04:33.207 --> 04:36.708
there was something
that happened, okay?

04:36.710 --> 04:41.146
And that led to
the return of her groove.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.981
Tandy, I saw this movie,

04:42.983 --> 04:44.783
and this has nothing
to do with that.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.419
She dies at the very
beginning of it,

04:47.421 --> 04:48.620
and then her two
young employees

04:48.622 --> 04:50.055
prop her up and
pretend she's alive

04:50.057 --> 04:51.323
for the whole weekend.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.091
Exactly, Carol! See?

04:53.093 --> 04:55.894
And this is just like
<i>Weekend at Stella's,</i> okay?

04:55.896 --> 04:58.430
See, look, right now
your feelings are dead.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.766
What we need to do
is prop them up

05:00.768 --> 05:02.901
and stuff them
full of groove, right?

05:02.903 --> 05:06.104
No, Tandy, you can't bring
dead things back to life.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.907
Hey, you tell that
to Jesus Christ,

05:08.909 --> 05:10.175
and his buddy Frankenstein.

05:10.177 --> 05:12.644
I guess you have
a point.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.513
Pack your bags.
We leave tonight.

05:24.991 --> 05:29.261
Come on, you stupid robot.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.996
Soup's on.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.532
You hungry for some wig?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.175
Okay, Gordon.

05:43.177 --> 05:46.778
Bait's set.
Now we wait.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.480
All right.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.216
There you go.

05:51.218 --> 05:54.052
See you tomorrow, okay?

05:55.154 --> 05:56.788
Where are you going?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.193
Uh...

06:01.195 --> 06:03.528
Well, I mean,
we-we broke up, so...

06:03.530 --> 06:04.963
We did?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.598
Yeah.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.434
That's too bad.

06:11.671 --> 06:13.538
All right, well,
good night.

No, Lewis.
It earned that dong.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.933
Hey. You guys
seen Melissa?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.368
Oh, no.
Is she missing again?

08:23.370 --> 08:24.603
Oh, no.

08:24.605 --> 08:25.770
She's here to the max.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.639
Yep. Know exactly
where she is.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.322
Yeah.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.490
Almost there.

08:45.492 --> 08:48.293
Just a little further.

08:48.295 --> 08:51.830
Little further.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.164
Happy honeymoon!

08:53.166 --> 08:54.366
What's all this?

08:54.368 --> 08:55.500
I recreated the campsite

08:55.502 --> 08:56.635
where we first met.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.969
Remember?

08:57.971 --> 09:00.171
I was wearing these
fashionable duds.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.307
Had that big, sexy beard.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.676
(laughs)
I was over here,

09:04.678 --> 09:08.013
sniffing up on your brassiere
like a gentleman.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.348

09:10.350 --> 09:13.385
(crying)

09:13.986 --> 09:15.987
(sighs)

09:15.989 --> 09:17.889
And remember what
you did? Huh?

09:17.891 --> 09:19.991
Yeah, I pulled a gun on you.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.726
Popped up
outta nowhere.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.161
Scared the
bejesus out of me.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.596
Made me wet my panties.

09:24.598 --> 09:25.830
But you said they were wet

09:25.832 --> 09:27.365
from something before.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.234
Well, that wasn't true.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.436
I was a lying
skunk back then.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.038
But not anymore.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.540
See, today, I'd proudly
admit that that wetness

09:35.542 --> 09:37.876
came from my penis.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.578
And that's all
'cause of you, girl.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.213
I-I don't want to hear

09:42.215 --> 09:44.215

in this world,

Thanks, Tandy.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.791
Hey, want to go
do some fishing?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.726
Oh, there's no fish.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.562
Really? 'Cause I have
a sneaky suspicion

09:57.564 --> 09:59.364
that you're about
to catch a whopper.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.632
And there might even be

10:00.634 --> 10:02.367
a little cheese on
there. Come on.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.702

Yaah!
Aaah!

22:06.859 --> 22:07.992
"Blusted!"

22:07.994 --> 22:09.493
I don't know anybody
like Mickey.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.164
Buh-buh,
buh-buh-buh-buh.

22:13.166 --> 22:16.534
-Get out!
-Mickey's best qualities
are that she, uh--

22:16.536 --> 22:17.668
(slurps)

22:21.840 --> 22:25.976
<i>The Mick</i> is a show about a
not-very-well-put-together woman

22:25.978 --> 22:28.112
who is a little rough
around the edges.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.047
(screaming)
We're gonna die!
(screams)

22:30.049 --> 22:33.684
Extremely selfish.
Not super classy
or put together.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.154
Hey there.
Oh, my God. MacKenzie.

22:37.156 --> 22:40.524
I wanted to give you
an opportunity to invest
in my future.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
There it is.
This is the Mickey
that I know.

22:42.528 --> 22:45.696
She needs money,
and so she goes to borrow it
from her rich sister.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.531
-Suddenly, the feds bust in.
-FBI!

22:47.533 --> 22:49.700
WOMAN: FBI!

22:49.702 --> 22:52.536
Arrest the parents,
and she's stuck with
these three children.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.638
-I need you to watch
the kids tonight.
-Oh, I know!

22:54.640 --> 22:56.507
Get one of those guys
outside the hardware stores.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.377
Just act like their aunt
for one day, and I'll get you
the money that you need.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.379
Where are you?
Oh, we had to flee
the country.

23:01.381 --> 23:04.415
-What?
-When you put that character
around children

23:04.417 --> 23:06.317
who are depending on her,
that's pretty terrible.

23:06.319 --> 23:09.019
Whoa! Aaah!

23:09.021 --> 23:12.356
-I think she's dead.
-No!
-(gasps)

23:12.358 --> 23:14.525
Not the qualities
you look for in an auntie.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.361
-She's a danger
to these children.
-The kids are fine!

23:17.363 --> 23:19.363
Mickey, can I have
some more ice cream?

23:19.365 --> 23:20.898
Oh! Aaah!
