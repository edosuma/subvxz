_

00:04.505 --> 00:06.338
The Alamo's fallen!

00:06.440 --> 00:08.774
Santa Anna has taken the Alamo!

00:15.032 --> 00:17.649
Santa Anna took no prisoners.

00:17.752 --> 00:21.620
Sam, what would your personal compunctions

00:21.706 --> 00:23.372
lead you to do?

00:23.457 --> 00:26.959
Let Santa Anna get drunk on
an abundance of confidence,

00:27.044 --> 00:30.462
and then we attack with a vengeance.

00:30.548 --> 00:32.381
Sergeant Knowles?

00:32.466 --> 00:33.716
What the hell?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.768
Last we heard, youse was deserting.

00:35.793 --> 00:36.781
Now, just... easy.

00:36.823 --> 00:40.108
General Houston wants us
to track down Santa Anna.

00:40.195 --> 00:43.279
Come here.

00:43.345 --> 00:45.262
As long as you don't get,

00:45.347 --> 00:48.899
you and your men are
gonna be overrun and die.

00:49.018 --> 00:52.069
I've ordered Colonel Fannin
to retreat from Goliad.

00:52.187 --> 00:54.988
This is the very kind of deliberation

00:55.074 --> 00:58.241
that lost the lives of our compatriots

00:58.266 --> 00:59.482
at the Alamo!

02:27.848 --> 02:29.848
Mexicans, right over the hill!

02:29.950 --> 02:31.650
Mexicans back yonder!

02:31.752 --> 02:33.518
- Close the gate!
- Right behind us!

02:33.620 --> 02:35.754
Urrea's whole army back yonder!

02:35.856 --> 02:38.256
Close the damned gate!
Close the damned gate!

02:38.359 --> 02:40.559
General Urrea's army right over the hill!

02:40.644 --> 02:42.260
Whoa, our scouts

02:42.363 --> 02:44.613
said Urrea's army wasn't
due for a few days, boys.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.765
Well, I reckon you got some
pretty lousy scouts, then.

02:46.867 --> 02:49.641
Mexicans close by. There's hundreds of 'em.

02:49.671 --> 02:52.722
Colonel, you want that I
should go ride for help?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.423
We're moving out. Pack it up.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.225
We ought to make a stand right here.

02:56.289 --> 02:57.588
Yeah, the boy's right.

02:57.613 --> 02:59.563
I don't want another Alamo on my hands.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.561
Yeah, we go out there,
it's gonna be a slaughter.

03:01.607 --> 03:03.390
Not if we make it out in time.

03:03.421 --> 03:05.414
Let's go! Let's go! Prepare to march!

03:05.486 --> 03:06.518
- Pack all the essentials!
- You ain't listening, Colonel.

03:06.619 --> 03:08.369
They're here! Listen to us.

03:08.439 --> 03:10.105
- They're here. We seen 'em.
- Get on your horse!

03:10.191 --> 03:12.608
Let's go, boys! Move! Let's go.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.194
Take all the essentials.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.696
Let's go! Let's go!

03:19.914 --> 03:24.648
_

03:42.440 --> 03:46.275
Your Excellency, pardon the intrusion.

03:46.394 --> 03:50.696
Our sentries captured a
prisoner riding from the north,

03:50.781 --> 03:53.365
but the rebel army is in Kent.

03:53.451 --> 03:56.402
Clearly, she belongs to
someone of importance.

03:56.487 --> 04:00.205
- No sign of a whip.
- I ain't common or a slave.

04:06.130 --> 04:09.415
Long ago I was contracted
as an indentured servant,

04:09.500 --> 04:10.716
but I was freed.

04:14.839 --> 04:16.672
Remove your hands from her.

04:23.431 --> 04:26.870
What is your name, Señorita?

04:28.702 --> 04:32.421
Emily West... native New Orleans.

04:34.091 --> 04:40.379
You may go with Colonel
Almonte to answer his questions,

04:40.481 --> 04:44.433
or you may remain here and answer mine.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.571
Well, I believe I'd like to get to know

04:49.690 --> 04:52.557
His Excellency better.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.360
And so you will.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.454
I'll send for you.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.198
Of all the settlers in the Union,

05:33.284 --> 05:35.367
there ain't nobody left to fight for.

05:35.453 --> 05:37.569
God damned Fannin.

05:37.655 --> 05:40.072
He's a crow's egg in an eagle's nest.

05:42.293 --> 05:43.608
Watch out!

05:47.214 --> 05:48.580
What's the hold up there?

05:51.252 --> 05:53.168
Yah, yah! Come on.

05:53.254 --> 05:54.803
Push!

05:57.475 --> 05:58.557
God damned wagon.

05:58.642 --> 06:00.292
Keep pushing!

06:00.401 --> 06:03.302
God damned Fannin. God damned every...

06:03.397 --> 06:05.314
God damned patriot.

06:05.433 --> 06:08.767
He thinks he can win this war on his own.

06:21.665 --> 06:25.367
Deaf, what's the doc
say about your condition?

06:27.505 --> 06:30.956
Ain't nothing changed since
he gave me the long face.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.092
Don't you never mind.

06:42.103 --> 06:43.302
Sam?

06:45.306 --> 06:47.306
Hope Miss Emily's feeling better.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.145
Sorry to hear she gone off.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.684
That Tejano Ranger, Flores...

06:59.787 --> 07:02.521
He's sweeping for stragglers with Anderson.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.023
Summon him up for me.

07:21.675 --> 07:26.061
My suspicion is that you
are running away from a man.

07:27.815 --> 07:31.150
Now, why do you suspect that?

07:31.235 --> 07:34.069
I just do.

07:34.188 --> 07:37.606
Well, I like to think I
might be running to something.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.575
General...

07:44.081 --> 07:46.114
I'm in the middle of lunch.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.332
I'm sorry.

07:47.418 --> 07:49.451
It's important, Your Excellency.

08:02.265 --> 08:04.182
Your vigilance is commendable,

08:04.207 --> 08:06.674
but I will handle the interrogation.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.722
Yes, Your Excellency.

08:19.483 --> 08:21.700
My man discovered an interesting monogram

08:21.785 --> 08:24.936
on your saddle.

08:25.039 --> 08:26.974
"S.H."

08:29.543 --> 08:31.293
S.H.:

08:31.412 --> 08:35.110
could that stand for Samuel Houston?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.616
Hmm?

08:38.719 --> 08:42.953
This is the man you are running from?

08:43.057 --> 08:46.391
He wasn't the man I thought he was.

08:46.477 --> 08:50.012
And why is that?

08:50.097 --> 08:53.632
I saw the look of defeat on his face

08:53.734 --> 08:55.317
when he heard what happened at the Alamo.

08:59.573 --> 09:02.574
Well, now you are here.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.539
What do you want?

09:11.285 --> 09:16.088
I want a warm bath

09:16.173 --> 09:18.340
with you in it.

09:24.734 --> 09:29.199
_

09:54.936 --> 09:58.637
We get past this ridge,
men, and we're safe!

09:58.662 --> 10:00.695
On the double! Let's go!

10:15.349 --> 10:17.215
Fall back! Fall back!

10:17.318 --> 10:18.483
Move! Move! Move!

10:42.209 --> 10:43.342
Ah!

10:55.272 --> 10:57.105
Defend your positions!
Defend your positions!

10:57.224 --> 10:58.440
Fire!

11:03.397 --> 11:06.648
Colonel's shot! Yance, give me a hand!

11:06.734 --> 11:08.150
Hang on, Colonel!

11:10.738 --> 11:12.204
We got you! Hang on!

11:12.289 --> 11:14.406
My leg! My leg!

11:18.712 --> 11:21.079
Wallace, send scouts to Houston!

11:23.584 --> 11:25.584
Houston ain't sending no
one! He's done warned you!

11:25.669 --> 11:27.419
You must go!

11:29.640 --> 11:32.123
Defend your positions! Spread out!

11:32.226 --> 11:33.667
Spread 'em!

11:35.712 --> 11:37.212
Boy, come here! My leg!

11:52.946 --> 11:54.562
General Urrea...

11:54.648 --> 11:56.781
Tell Santa Anna we have
surrounded the rebels.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.234
His Excellency will not accept surrender.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.702
You must finish them.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.571
I am not a butcher.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.707
I will deliver your message.

12:11.548 --> 12:13.632
Come on! This way, Truett! Over here!

12:16.553 --> 12:18.503
How the hell did Fannin become Colonel?

12:18.588 --> 12:20.472
Must have married well.

12:26.263 --> 12:27.562
What's that sound?

12:27.681 --> 12:28.813
The hell's that?

12:34.488 --> 12:36.321
They're messing with us.

13:51.848 --> 13:54.966
Tonight, my countrymen,

13:55.068 --> 13:59.237
we not only celebrate
our successes in battle,

13:59.422 --> 14:01.840
but the total victory to come.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.408
You stand in San Durant.

14:08.598 --> 14:11.299
Chupaldo, where are you? I don't see you.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.758
I'll give you the great
honor to dispatch this message

14:20.861 --> 14:23.900
on the flag of truce to General Houston.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.601
This message says,

14:29.703 --> 14:31.870
"There will be no refuge, no escape,

14:31.955 --> 14:36.407
"no surrender, no mercy.

14:36.493 --> 14:40.328
"You will be hunted down, butchered,

14:40.413 --> 14:43.464
"and fed to my pigs!

14:43.583 --> 14:49.003
And then, in turn, we will
feast on you in celebration."

14:54.928 --> 14:56.071
Compañeros!

14:56.096 --> 14:59.347
Vamonos!

14:59.432 --> 15:02.517
Tomorrow, they might take our lives,

15:02.602 --> 15:05.436
but never our spirit...

15:05.522 --> 15:07.822
the Mexican spirit!

15:09.442 --> 15:11.976
Musica!

15:22.339 --> 15:25.456
The men need that kind of thing.

15:25.542 --> 15:30.762
Señor Presidente, General
Urrea has Fannin trapped.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.632
By morning, he will have the
surrender of over 300 prisoners.

15:34.718 --> 15:36.384
Prisoners?

15:36.469 --> 15:40.521
Those men are fighting
under no recognized flag.

15:40.640 --> 15:44.309
The rules of war do not apply.

15:44.394 --> 15:46.778
Don Antonio,

15:46.863 --> 15:49.614
it's the Easter celebration.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.483
Perhaps mercy would be
the Christian thing to do.

15:52.569 --> 15:55.353
Christian?

15:55.455 --> 16:00.992
They are from the devil, not Jesus,

16:01.077 --> 16:04.935
and there will be no resurrection.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.114
Fannin should've listened to Houston.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.654
You think we'll get out of here alive?

16:29.739 --> 16:31.822
I wonder what Sarah's doing right now.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.624
Don't you be thinking about my gal.

16:33.710 --> 16:35.543
No.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.861
Get some sleep, boys.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.998
Urrea won't try another
attack till morning.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.624
Got no need to hurry.

16:48.925 --> 16:51.709
Feel like I've been ate by a wolf.

16:51.811 --> 16:56.013
Yeah, and shit off a cliff.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.652
You boys brothers?

17:01.738 --> 17:05.690
Nah, he's too ugly to be relation.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.742
Yeah, well, he's too stupid.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.747
I got a brother.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.915
We call him Bigfoot

17:15.034 --> 17:18.085
on account of he once killed
an Injun with big feet.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.873
Our pap...

17:22.959 --> 17:25.760
he's a Virginia blacksmith.

17:25.877 --> 17:30.715
He made us these matching
wrist cuffs to bond us.

17:41.484 --> 17:44.068
I hope like hell to see him again.

17:53.958 --> 17:57.409
- General?
- Come in.

17:57.711 --> 18:00.495
If those Ranger boys don't
come back with Fannin,

18:00.581 --> 18:02.381
I'm cutting him loose.

18:02.466 --> 18:04.966
Captains... misters Truett and Yancey,

18:05.085 --> 18:08.053
are due to report back tomorrow.

18:08.138 --> 18:09.421
Have a seat.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.256
Sir.

18:11.341 --> 18:14.559
Would you like a cigar?

18:14.645 --> 18:16.311
Sir, thank you.

18:33.047 --> 18:36.782
Señor Flores,

18:36.884 --> 18:40.786
I need a volunteer to
infiltrate Santa Anna's camp;

18:40.888 --> 18:44.189
assess the size and
readiness of his troops.

18:44.291 --> 18:47.326
What say you?

18:47.428 --> 18:49.995
I'd be awake, beast to hand, if I could.

18:50.097 --> 18:51.363
Very good.

18:54.051 --> 18:55.700
Yes, sir.

18:55.803 --> 18:58.003
I want you to find out
if Emily West is there.

18:58.088 --> 19:01.890
If she's in trouble, I
need you to get her out.

19:02.009 --> 19:03.675
She can be high-strung,

19:03.761 --> 19:07.846
but you strike me as a man who
can handle a spirited woman.

19:09.850 --> 19:14.153
Very clever of Houston
to send you to spy on me.

19:14.238 --> 19:17.856
He tried to stop me.

19:17.942 --> 19:19.891
I came on my own.

19:19.994 --> 19:22.327
He tried to stop you?

19:22.413 --> 19:25.948
I thought he barely noticed you were gone.

19:26.033 --> 19:30.402
Well, we had a fiery affair.

19:30.504 --> 19:35.791
It was a blaze so scorching,
it consumed itself,

19:35.876 --> 19:39.077
then he grew cold to the touch.

19:39.180 --> 19:41.263
I am cold.

19:45.219 --> 19:49.638
Well, then, I must make certain

19:49.723 --> 19:55.394
that you stay very, very warm.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.869
Opium.

20:03.954 --> 20:06.428
Romulo, bring the pipe.

20:14.965 --> 20:19.718
"I have no fear of an army of lions

20:19.803 --> 20:22.804
"led by your sheep,

20:22.923 --> 20:30.679
but I do have fear of an army
of sheep led by your lion."

20:30.764 --> 20:34.266
Alexander the Great.

20:34.351 --> 20:40.155
Which one is he... a sheep or lion?

20:40.274 --> 20:44.152
Well, is it me you want

20:44.177 --> 20:47.178
or General Houston?

20:48.865 --> 20:50.532
I have you.

20:54.955 --> 20:55.870
Ah!

20:55.956 --> 21:00.458
But do not think I am fooled.

21:00.544 --> 21:04.262
I know that a sweet-scented yellow rose

21:04.347 --> 21:09.634
like you has sharp thorns.

21:13.390 --> 21:19.310
Perhaps on occasion,

21:19.396 --> 21:22.947
but tonight...

21:23.033 --> 21:27.235
I'm the one who's gonna be pricked.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.533
Over there!

21:41.618 --> 21:43.952
I see 'em! We'll lead the line!

21:44.037 --> 21:45.620
Wake up, boys. Wake up.

21:45.706 --> 21:47.172
Wake up. Wake up.

21:47.257 --> 21:49.040
We can hear 'em clicking and signaling.

21:49.126 --> 21:51.459
It's time to get ready to
fight. Wake up. Wake up, boys.

21:51.545 --> 21:54.346
- I hate this damned music.
- That's what they want.

22:18.989 --> 22:23.208
Yance! Yance, I... I can't see!

22:23.293 --> 22:25.627
- Help!
- I can't see!

22:25.746 --> 22:27.445
- Somebody, we need bandages!
- I can't see!

22:27.548 --> 22:29.464
Help! Come on, buddy. Come on.

22:29.583 --> 22:31.082
Am I gonna die?

22:31.168 --> 22:33.468
No, no, no, no, you're not gonna die.

22:33.587 --> 22:35.170
Come on. Come on, buddy.

22:35.255 --> 22:36.621
- Am I gonna die?
- Come on, buddy.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.289
- Am I gonna die?
- You're not gonna die!

22:38.392 --> 22:40.141
No. You ain't!

22:44.598 --> 22:45.630
Come on!

22:45.732 --> 22:48.266
Help me! Help!

22:53.273 --> 22:55.273
Come on, partner.

22:57.361 --> 22:59.411
We supposed to be heroes.

22:59.496 --> 23:01.145
Come on, son.

23:01.248 --> 23:02.480
- It ain't over yet.
- You're all right.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.115
You've got yourself to look out for.

23:04.201 --> 23:06.001
- Come on.
- I'll make it count.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.286
Deaf and the Rangers
will get us out of this.

23:08.372 --> 23:10.922
No, you stay with me. You'll die out there.

23:11.008 --> 23:14.342
Rangers don't take no
orders from the damn army!

23:17.631 --> 23:20.215
I'm going for help! I'm... I'm going for...

23:23.387 --> 23:26.304
It's all right. It's all
right. It's all right.

23:26.390 --> 23:27.522
We're going, girl.

23:27.641 --> 23:29.140
We're going. Come on, girl.

23:29.226 --> 23:31.509
All right...

23:31.612 --> 23:33.445
We're going to get Houston!

23:33.530 --> 23:36.014
We're going to get General Houston!

23:42.623 --> 23:46.291
Pull the cannon. Advance the cannons!

24:27.501 --> 24:29.117
Nice shootin'.

24:39.893 --> 24:42.914
_

24:42.939 --> 24:44.672
Break camp.

24:44.697 --> 24:45.960
Today's detail.

24:45.985 --> 24:50.654
We sweep these valleys for
any wayward homesteaders.

24:50.739 --> 24:54.208
That means you, Gator.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.276
What do we do with him?

24:56.362 --> 24:59.029
Nothing. He's being executed.

24:59.114 --> 25:00.781
I reckon he can wait here shackled

25:00.866 --> 25:03.250
till the firing squad come.

25:03.369 --> 25:05.068
We ain't gonna wait.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.037
He already run off when he
weren't gonna be executed.

25:07.122 --> 25:08.455
No, no, no, no, gentlemen,
gentlemen, please.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.140
I will wait for 'em. I will.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.176
I will wait like you never
seen no one wait before.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.912
Please, just carry on
with your duties and chores

25:16.014 --> 25:18.131
and you can trust I ain't gonna do nothing

25:18.217 --> 25:22.219
but stay right here, on my honor.

25:22.304 --> 25:24.087
Let's shoot him.

25:24.489 --> 25:28.158
Whoa, it's a damned shame
to kill a man for pilfering.

25:28.243 --> 25:29.826
Man's got to eat, right?

25:29.911 --> 25:31.444
Are we supposed to execute him?

25:31.530 --> 25:32.579
Not a Ranger's job.

25:32.698 --> 25:34.531
The army convicted him.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.898
They shoot him.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.667
May I just suggest...

25:37.753 --> 25:40.336
I suggest you shut your hole.

25:40.422 --> 25:43.906
I'm only saying why not
just take me with you?

25:44.009 --> 25:45.842
Take me; make me
do what-some-ever

25:45.927 --> 25:48.294
you might need me to do.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.297
I could... well... I
could carry your saddlebag.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.816
- I could...
- That's enough.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.422
Rangers are not
executioners, you reprobate.

26:03.561 --> 26:06.813
This man is right, if I may say so.

26:06.932 --> 26:08.798
Making sure people's safe from Mexicans...

26:08.900 --> 26:10.400
that's a whole hell of a lot more important

26:10.485 --> 26:12.769
than shooting some no-account deserter

26:12.854 --> 26:13.970
like myself.

26:14.072 --> 26:15.738
I ain't worth it.

26:15.824 --> 26:17.490
I ain't nowhere near worth it.

26:17.609 --> 26:19.359
That's for damned sure.

26:19.444 --> 26:22.495
Hell, you ain't even
worth the shot and powder.

26:22.614 --> 26:24.814
You know what? You're
clearly a very smart man.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.983
That's right. I am.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.785
Still say we shoot him.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.172
Well, well...

26:35.126 --> 26:37.326
You agree not to rabbit off...

26:37.429 --> 26:39.662
lend us a hand while we help
get these settlers to safety?

26:39.764 --> 26:42.882
Course... innocent settler...
that was what I was doing before.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.885
You do not charge for your services.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.309
- Right.
- No tricks.

26:47.334 --> 26:48.450
No.

26:48.475 --> 26:49.832
Or I will let Vern shoot you.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.774
Yes, sir. I swear.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.509
I swear.

26:53.611 --> 26:54.694
But if I may just one...

26:54.813 --> 26:56.529
make one last suggestion,

26:56.648 --> 27:01.367
I still don't quite understand
how we can do something

27:01.486 --> 27:05.621
and then not getting
anywhere near paid for it.

27:05.707 --> 27:06.706
Just saying.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.822
You dug up the chest?

27:39.908 --> 27:41.774
You and the little one are gonna need money

27:41.860 --> 27:44.360
when you go to Victoria.

27:44.446 --> 27:46.446
I'm not going anywhere without you.

27:46.531 --> 27:47.830
Yes, you is.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.899
Them Mexicans bastards are coming.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.418
Deaf, I'm Mexican.

27:52.537 --> 27:53.920
And so was I.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.705
And now we's Texian.

27:58.543 --> 27:59.625
Damn it.

28:17.763 --> 28:21.264
Lupe...

28:22.601 --> 28:24.744
You're right. I'm sorry.

28:24.769 --> 28:26.803
That was very...

28:26.888 --> 28:29.305
it was a poor choice of words.

28:29.391 --> 28:32.275
But you ain't seen what I seen.

28:32.360 --> 28:34.610
This ain't about us.

28:34.796 --> 28:36.445
It's about a tyrant we can't abide by.

28:36.548 --> 28:37.914
You know that.

28:41.169 --> 28:42.835
Lupe.

28:48.726 --> 28:51.644
I ain't seen Half Breed.

28:51.763 --> 28:55.481
He comes and goes; got a mind of his own.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.266
He's a smart dog...

28:57.352 --> 28:59.602
knows when to get,

28:59.687 --> 29:02.271
which is what you got to
do till we whoop Santa Anna.

29:02.357 --> 29:04.407
And if you don't?

29:04.492 --> 29:07.276
Well, then, it ain't gonna matter, Lupe.

29:07.362 --> 29:08.678
We'll all be dead.

29:15.120 --> 29:19.321
Shrewsbury, we are the Rangers!

29:19.424 --> 29:20.590
We're here to help!

29:20.675 --> 29:21.841
By order of the Texian government,

29:21.960 --> 29:24.760
you must evacuate to safety.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.458
Shrewsbury!

29:30.885 --> 29:33.719
We gonna take a gander inside?

29:33.805 --> 29:36.165
Let's send this hear wormy feller in.

29:36.190 --> 29:38.691
It's high time he learned a
thing or two about rangering.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.328
Wormy... that's good. That's good.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.947
I see what you're doing,
but the thing is, gentlemen.

29:45.032 --> 29:46.866
I just ain't dumb,

29:46.951 --> 29:48.751
so it ain't hard for me to see
there is no reason whatsoever

29:48.836 --> 29:50.369
for me to go in there.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.653
Ain't scared, is you?

29:51.678 --> 29:52.760
Ho!

29:52.924 --> 29:54.557
- You saying I's yellow?
- Yep.

29:54.642 --> 29:56.788
- Youse born yellow.
- You saying I's...

29:56.813 --> 29:58.312
Yellow as your damned shirt.

29:58.337 --> 30:00.387
- Get on in there.
- Is that a fact?

30:02.767 --> 30:06.652
All right, well...

30:06.771 --> 30:09.155
I... y'all at least gonna give
me a damned pistol or something?

30:09.274 --> 30:11.023
We got you covered.

30:11.109 --> 30:12.525
All right.

30:17.865 --> 30:18.998
Ah!

30:53.034 --> 30:54.400
"Gone for licker."

30:56.988 --> 30:58.904
Who's that in there?

30:58.990 --> 31:00.156
Who's that in there?

31:03.711 --> 31:05.044
You best answer me!

31:10.501 --> 31:12.468
The Rangers come to help!

31:21.763 --> 31:23.686
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

31:23.711 --> 31:27.910
Damned pig 'bout broke my damned leg.

31:27.935 --> 31:29.615
Whoa.

31:29.709 --> 31:31.153
Is there anyone home?

31:31.239 --> 31:33.022
You done good, Knowles.

31:33.107 --> 31:35.074
Then again, it is starting to look a lot

31:35.193 --> 31:37.910
like bacon and ham hocks for supper.

31:40.998 --> 31:42.081
Whoa.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.899
- We got pork for supper.
- Whoo!

31:44.001 --> 31:46.085
We gonna be eating fine tonight. Hoo-hoo!

31:46.204 --> 31:47.903
Truett and Yancey report in yet?

31:48.005 --> 31:49.538
They haven't. I hadn't seen hide or hair.

31:49.624 --> 31:51.841
We best report back to Houston.

31:51.926 --> 31:52.875
Let's go.

32:37.922 --> 32:39.814
Don't be too hard on 'em, Colonel.

32:39.839 --> 32:41.973
They got their pride too.

32:43.928 --> 32:45.461
I cannot offer you terms.

32:45.563 --> 32:48.731
You must surrender at discretion.

32:48.816 --> 32:49.899
If you won't grant their lives,

32:49.984 --> 32:51.100
my men will keep killing Mexicans

32:51.185 --> 32:52.852
until their last breath.

32:52.937 --> 32:55.020
Surrender, Colonel.

32:55.106 --> 32:57.773
I will see that your men are
fed and taken back to Goliad

32:57.859 --> 32:59.975
as prisoners.

33:00.077 --> 33:01.827
If you give me your assurance
that my men will be treated

33:01.946 --> 33:05.164
under the rules of war.

33:05.283 --> 33:09.752
I will appeal on your
behalf to General Santa Anna.

33:09.837 --> 33:12.379
I suppose that's the best I can do.

33:29.307 --> 33:32.454
I rely on your honest effort!

33:40.351 --> 33:41.613
Come on, Señor Beans.

33:44.488 --> 33:46.388
I think it's about time to
cut that up there, Beans.

33:46.490 --> 33:48.190
We all might hungry over here.

33:48.275 --> 33:50.993
Hey, I'm so starved I
could eat the south end

33:51.078 --> 33:52.611
of a northbound goat, but it ain't ready.

33:52.696 --> 33:54.496
Get your damned hand out of there.

33:54.582 --> 33:56.331
Why don't you just hush
up? All of y'all hush up.

33:56.417 --> 33:58.233
The only one that's gonna
be carving that porker

33:58.335 --> 34:01.703
right there will be none other
than this gentleman right here.

34:01.789 --> 34:05.541
Why? 'Cause who's the
one who flushed him out?

34:05.626 --> 34:07.459
Who's the one who flushed him out?

34:07.545 --> 34:11.013
Now, what I remember is this
little piggy flushing you out.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.715
I can see you gentlemen

34:13.801 --> 34:15.934
are doing your damnedest

34:16.053 --> 34:18.587
to overlook the fact that I
risked me my damned behind.

34:18.688 --> 34:21.023
That pretty little Señorita
that Truett and Yancey

34:21.108 --> 34:23.525
are sweet on...

34:23.610 --> 34:28.096
she must need comforting
with them boys gone.

34:28.197 --> 34:30.532
Watch yourself, Vern.

34:30.618 --> 34:33.346
You know that's Doc Ewing's daughter.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.156
He married a Mexican?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.993
Tejana.

34:41.078 --> 34:46.681
Doc won't ever talk about it,
but she's not around no more.

34:48.385 --> 34:51.670
Poor thing; no mama.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.456
Don't pester that girl, Vern,

34:54.558 --> 34:58.226
or her father will
shoot you where it hurts.

35:16.413 --> 35:18.330
Buenos tardes.

35:20.357 --> 35:22.607
That's all right. I got it.

35:22.786 --> 35:25.558
You ought never to have
to work a day in your life.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.511
Allow me.

35:32.630 --> 35:34.713
This is how they do in the islands,

35:34.798 --> 35:35.964
only they don't use no hands.

35:36.050 --> 35:37.382
All right, just give me my basket.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.717
And they dance the live long day.

35:38.802 --> 35:40.435
Please, give me my basket now!

35:40.521 --> 35:42.270
Sarah!

35:42.356 --> 35:45.548
Get your basket, Sarah, and get on inside.

35:49.363 --> 35:51.563
Doc.

36:32.272 --> 36:37.225
General Portilla, where
are you taking my men?

36:37.327 --> 36:39.194
I should be with them!

36:39.279 --> 36:40.529
You couldn't keep up.

36:40.614 --> 36:43.331
You will have to be shot like a lame horse.

36:43.417 --> 36:45.534
General Urrea promised...

36:45.619 --> 36:47.169
promised!

36:47.254 --> 36:49.621
He does not speak for General Santa Anna.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.873
He does not tolerate traitors.

37:00.310 --> 37:03.862
If I am to be executed, I
will be shot in the chest

37:03.887 --> 37:06.388
and buried like a Christian
in a box with a marker.

37:09.643 --> 37:13.261
And I request that you
send this watch to my family

37:13.363 --> 37:14.780
in Marion, Georgia.

37:31.582 --> 37:35.300
If you were a soldier...

37:35.419 --> 37:38.286
but you are a stinking wetback.

37:38.388 --> 37:42.841
You swam across the Sabine River,

37:42.926 --> 37:45.594
and you are here illegally

37:45.679 --> 37:47.979
in my country.

37:57.608 --> 37:59.775
Keep walking.

38:10.504 --> 38:13.421
General Urrea's army is approaching Goliad.

38:13.507 --> 38:15.156
We got to get 'em out.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.555
Any news from your boys at Goliad?

38:30.641 --> 38:33.024
General, what are your orders?

38:35.896 --> 38:40.515
We must do what's prudent;
not what emotion dictates.

38:40.617 --> 38:42.400
Our enemy wants to
catch us out in the open,

38:42.486 --> 38:45.353
where numbers count.

38:45.455 --> 38:49.524
I can't risk us getting pincered
between Santa Anna's armies.

38:49.626 --> 38:51.459
The order stands.

38:51.545 --> 38:54.212
We will continue to withdraw east...

38:54.331 --> 38:57.499
stretch out their supply
lines... pick our ground.

38:57.584 --> 39:00.335
Withdraw, sir? The men
are already talking mutiny.

39:00.420 --> 39:02.504
Let 'em talk while they retreat.

39:02.589 --> 39:04.139
Yeah, but what about the dissidents

39:04.224 --> 39:06.207
like Baker and Sherman?

39:06.310 --> 39:09.427
- What should I tell them?
- Tell 'em to follow orders!

39:09.513 --> 39:13.598
These boys have maybe...
maybe one battle in 'em.

39:14.215 --> 39:15.931
If it comes at the wrong time,

39:16.037 --> 39:18.270
we all die.

39:18.355 --> 39:20.572
You men are in charge while I'm gone.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.324
You're leaving, sir?

39:22.409 --> 39:24.860
- Where to?
- Goliad.

39:24.945 --> 39:27.162
I can't afford to lose those men.

39:27.247 --> 39:28.730
- But, General...
- Drill the volunteers.

39:28.832 --> 39:30.582
Discipline 'em. Make 'em an army.

39:30.701 --> 39:32.901
That is all. Rally the Rangers.

39:33.003 --> 39:34.669
I am personally pulling Fannin's head

39:34.755 --> 39:37.717
out of his puckered West Point ass.

39:40.377 --> 39:41.710
You heard the man.

39:41.795 --> 39:43.628
Let's make an army.

39:58.562 --> 40:01.229
They said they were putting
us on a boat to Matamoros.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.814
This road's to Victoria.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.817
I don't think they're
taking us to either place.

40:10.584 --> 40:11.717
Take water.

40:14.328 --> 40:16.277
Water!

40:28.425 --> 40:29.841
Drink up. Drink up.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.927
All right.

40:32.012 --> 40:33.311
Orderly, men.

40:33.430 --> 40:34.346
Orderly.

40:34.431 --> 40:35.347
Single file line;

40:35.432 --> 40:36.898
we will all get our water.

40:36.984 --> 40:39.734
We're not animals.

40:39.820 --> 40:42.237
Come get your water.

40:42.322 --> 40:45.273
Water, men... single file line.

40:58.505 --> 41:00.321
What is going on?

41:00.424 --> 41:02.624
Fellas, kneel!

41:03.169 --> 41:05.420
People won't forget what you're doing here.

41:05.445 --> 41:06.861
Aim!

41:08.915 --> 41:10.748
They're gonna remember this,

41:10.867 --> 41:13.668
and they're gonna remember the Alamo.

41:13.753 --> 41:15.119
Remember the Alamo.

41:15.205 --> 41:17.705
Remember the Alamo!

41:17.791 --> 41:19.073
Remember the Alamo!

41:19.175 --> 41:21.175
Remember the Alamo!

41:21.261 --> 41:22.593
Fire!

41:37.311 --> 41:39.111
left, right, left, right, left, right...

41:39.136 --> 41:41.238
Houston needs to cease wasting time

41:41.263 --> 41:42.891
with these exercises
and march us to Goliad,

41:42.916 --> 41:46.568
otherwise we'll have a repetition of Alamo.

41:46.670 --> 41:51.239
I do believe if President
Burnet knew of our situation,

41:52.735 --> 41:54.151
it'd be a different story.

41:54.176 --> 41:56.894
- Mm-hmm.
 - Again, Sergeant. Again.

41:57.012 --> 41:59.273
Mosley Baker... suggestion?

41:59.298 --> 42:00.830
Sir!

42:01.217 --> 42:02.633
Private Lamar...

42:02.752 --> 42:04.635
I volunteered to fight for Texas,

42:04.754 --> 42:06.953
not march in a damned Easter parade.

42:07.056 --> 42:08.639
Is that right?

42:10.360 --> 42:13.694
Private Lamar, report here now!

42:14.280 --> 42:17.164
We will not tolerate insolent behavior!

42:19.474 --> 42:22.068
This is Mirabeau Lamar.

42:22.171 --> 42:27.124
He's secretly circulating a
petition to remove Houston.

42:27.209 --> 42:29.009
Sir?

42:29.094 --> 42:32.212
Private Lamar... please.

42:37.186 --> 42:38.352
You may sit.

42:43.192 --> 42:48.729
Private Lamar, we had a crisis
with our gutless commander,

42:48.814 --> 42:51.732
and we understand you are of a like mind.

42:54.153 --> 42:56.069
We need to get a urgent message

42:56.155 --> 42:59.272
to Secretary of War Rusk.

42:59.375 --> 43:00.707
Can you do that?

43:04.630 --> 43:07.047
They may not know how to march,

43:07.132 --> 43:11.635
but trust me, they know how to argue.

43:11.754 --> 43:16.790
Colonel Seguin, despite
our poor marching abilities,

43:16.892 --> 43:19.643
take comfort in knowing that
the men's hatred for Santa Anna

43:19.762 --> 43:20.894
binds us together.

43:29.822 --> 43:32.823
And so does their hatred for Sam Houston.

43:37.580 --> 43:38.912
The horses are tuckered.

43:38.998 --> 43:41.248
There's a water hole
right around that bend.

43:43.669 --> 43:46.486
Charmaine could use a nice
drink and a good graze,

43:46.589 --> 43:48.464
couldn't you, old girl?

43:48.489 --> 43:50.267
Captain, it seems like you love that horse

43:50.315 --> 43:53.566
more than you do your wife.

43:53.629 --> 43:56.213
Hey, Deaf, who's a better mount:

43:56.298 --> 43:59.132
your wife or your horse?

43:59.218 --> 44:00.801
A horse.

44:00.886 --> 44:02.936
He sure does love that horse.

44:03.022 --> 44:04.187
I see; you're having a nice jest

44:04.306 --> 44:07.007
at the expense of my impairment.

44:07.109 --> 44:09.693
The good thing is I don't need
to hear no disparaging nonsense

44:09.812 --> 44:11.612
from the likes of you.

44:11.697 --> 44:13.146
You have something to say that matters,

44:13.232 --> 44:15.699
you best say to my fast.

44:15.818 --> 44:17.183
That's all right, Captain.

44:17.286 --> 44:21.288
No sense in getting all hot and bothered.

44:21.373 --> 44:23.523
Hey, I'm just wondering who bucks harder.

44:25.327 --> 44:28.161
- What'd he say?
- Nothing.

44:39.892 --> 44:41.708
The Union's impositions

44:41.810 --> 44:45.762
have negative repercussions
for the individuals of Texas.

44:45.848 --> 44:50.017
Texas must be a sovereign nation.

44:50.102 --> 44:52.152
President Jackson
supports western expansion

44:52.237 --> 44:53.654
all the way to the coast.

44:53.739 --> 44:54.988
Then why doesn't he send his troops?

44:55.074 --> 44:56.740
Because this way,

44:56.859 --> 45:00.610
Jackson is free to let
Texas into the Union,

45:00.696 --> 45:03.507
and lead a clear, militaristic path

45:03.532 --> 45:05.365
all the way to California.

45:05.450 --> 45:08.702
Your blind ignorance
never ceases to amaze me.

45:08.787 --> 45:10.937
Old Hickory is bound by treaty.

45:11.039 --> 45:13.206
He can't just invade Mexico

45:13.292 --> 45:16.159
and invite the likes of
the Spaniards and the French

45:16.245 --> 45:18.128
and the crusty Brits to intervene.

45:18.247 --> 45:20.463
This is different, gentlemen.

45:20.582 --> 45:21.998
This is Texas.

45:22.084 --> 45:24.417
- Hey, Texas is part of Mexico.
- Yeah.

45:24.503 --> 45:26.286
What do you think we're fighting for, huh?

45:26.388 --> 45:29.122
Yeah, but this is where
you're wrong, Colonel Seguin.

45:29.224 --> 45:34.394
With Houston as our general,
we don't do much fighting.

45:44.173 --> 45:46.256
Robert Knowles,

45:46.341 --> 45:49.009
you're not hiding from
your general, are you?

45:50.345 --> 45:54.064
No, no, sir, I was just...

45:54.183 --> 45:56.733
Yes, sir, I was trying to hide
from you, General Houston, sir.

45:56.852 --> 45:58.652
I... yes.

45:58.737 --> 46:01.188
I have my eye on you.

46:01.273 --> 46:03.607
You rangering now?

46:03.692 --> 46:06.076
He prefers it to the firing squad.

46:06.101 --> 46:07.650
How's he doing?

46:07.763 --> 46:08.929
Passable.

46:09.014 --> 46:10.731
Ain't tried to run off.

46:10.816 --> 46:12.065
I'm with Vern.

46:12.151 --> 46:13.734
I say we shoot him.

46:13.819 --> 46:15.852
- I tried, General.
- He did.

46:15.938 --> 46:17.571
Be happy to try again.

46:18.991 --> 46:20.607
We let him ride with us.

46:20.692 --> 46:22.826
We didn't know what else to do with him.

46:22.945 --> 46:25.145
Robert, what qualities
do you possess to commend

46:25.247 --> 46:26.646
you for a pardon?

46:26.749 --> 46:28.698
He don't got no good qualities.

46:28.784 --> 46:30.083
Hell no.

46:30.169 --> 46:31.835
Qualities, sir... qualities.

46:31.954 --> 46:35.505
Well, I like this part of
the country a whole lot.

46:35.530 --> 46:38.364
I like the air around here.

46:38.389 --> 46:39.554
I like... I do.

46:39.579 --> 46:41.155
I like breathing it in, and then,

46:41.180 --> 46:43.213
I like sleeping under the stars as well.

46:43.298 --> 46:46.166
And, oh, I like breathing the
air while I'm sleeping under...

46:46.191 --> 46:47.654
Knowles,

46:47.679 --> 46:50.193
can't you think of anything
good to say about yourself?

46:53.225 --> 46:54.941
No.

46:56.979 --> 46:59.846
Damn it, I promise you, General Houston,

46:59.948 --> 47:03.116
I do not care about nobody but myself.

47:03.202 --> 47:07.070
I am bull-headed, and
I'm ornery as a snake.

47:07.156 --> 47:08.622
Ornery?

47:11.243 --> 47:12.192
Ornery's good.

47:12.294 --> 47:14.194
Yep.

47:14.496 --> 47:17.030
Ornery's not bad for rangering company.

47:17.115 --> 47:19.165
- Ornery!
- Ornery.

47:19.251 --> 47:20.867
Right? Let's ride out, boys.

47:20.952 --> 47:23.086
Vern's the orneriest son of a bitch I know.

47:23.205 --> 47:26.006
Yes, he is.

47:26.091 --> 47:27.340
Ornery.

47:30.545 --> 47:31.878
Whoo!

47:35.350 --> 47:40.261
_

47:42.224 --> 47:44.024
You gonna cook them taters

47:44.109 --> 47:48.462
or make a necklace out of
'em to wear with your skirt?

48:04.796 --> 48:07.797
I bet you dyspepsia is not unknown to you.

48:07.916 --> 48:09.735
Can't say I know him.

48:11.119 --> 48:13.320
Oh.

48:13.505 --> 48:15.305
You know what, Hays?

48:15.424 --> 48:17.841
You remind me of my big brother Samuel.

48:17.926 --> 48:20.093
I'm chagrined by the
notion of any resemblance

48:20.178 --> 48:23.313
to myself and any pack
member of the Wallace species.

48:23.432 --> 48:25.181
Well, don't get the big head on me.

48:25.267 --> 48:28.401
You don't look more alike
than me and a mule's ass.

48:28.487 --> 48:29.969
Well, dead ringers, then...

48:30.072 --> 48:31.571
uncanny.

48:33.191 --> 48:35.408
Sammy's got a way about him.

48:35.494 --> 48:37.643
Horse sense, I guess you'd call it.

48:37.746 --> 48:39.746
I see a lot of him in you.

48:45.954 --> 48:48.121
This can stand to stew a bit yet.

48:52.127 --> 48:53.793
When we was growing up,

48:53.879 --> 48:57.097
Sammy saved my sorry butt more than once.

48:57.182 --> 48:58.798
Ward off the bullies, did he?

48:58.884 --> 49:00.717
Oh, hell no... made me whoop 'em.

49:00.802 --> 49:03.219
If I hadn't, he'da whooped me worse.

49:03.305 --> 49:05.105
I sense our kinship.

49:05.190 --> 49:08.775
Hey, you sass me all you want
with that highbrow blather,

49:08.860 --> 49:12.145
but I am paying you one
hell of a compliment.

49:13.865 --> 49:17.183
If your brother's half the man you are,

49:17.285 --> 49:19.235
we're gonna be good friends.

49:22.157 --> 49:23.907
Taters could've used another five minutes

49:23.992 --> 49:26.126
on the coals.

49:55.941 --> 49:57.824
Ah!

50:02.304 --> 50:03.894
_

50:03.919 --> 50:05.452
Careful with that.

50:05.500 --> 50:07.200
Those are the president's belongings.

50:07.285 --> 50:09.525
Hurry up. No time to waste.

50:14.376 --> 50:15.792
President Burnet?

50:15.877 --> 50:17.510
President Burnet is busy.

50:17.596 --> 50:18.928
I need to see the president.

50:19.047 --> 50:22.748
Santanistas just burned Bellville.

50:22.851 --> 50:24.133
Señor, I said you can't come in.

50:24.219 --> 50:25.692
Mr. President,

50:25.717 --> 50:27.531
I'm here under urgent dispatch
of Colonel Mosley Baker.

50:27.556 --> 50:29.189
It is my duty to present this petition

50:29.274 --> 50:30.974
- from your rank and file.
- And you would be?

50:31.059 --> 50:33.889
Private Mirabeau Bonaparte
Lamar... Fairfield, Georgia, sir.

50:34.023 --> 50:35.028
Spit it out, boy.

50:35.113 --> 50:37.063
We got to go before Santa Anna gets here.

50:37.148 --> 50:38.982
Houston will not engage.

50:39.067 --> 50:41.150
Rusk, why won't your men meet the enemy?

50:41.236 --> 50:43.236
- 'Cause he's a damned coward.
- Houston may be many things,

50:43.321 --> 50:45.071
but a coward he is not.

50:45.156 --> 50:46.906
Then what in the name of
God is that man's soul?

50:46.992 --> 50:49.442
I presume General Houston
is picking his ground, sir.

50:49.544 --> 50:51.911
Forgive me Mister
Secretary, Mister President.

50:51.997 --> 50:54.080
I desperately insist you come to the front.

50:54.165 --> 50:55.948
I feel we face a mass desertion.

50:56.051 --> 50:57.383
Look around you, son.

50:57.469 --> 51:00.286
The Santanistas are half
a day's ride from here.

51:00.388 --> 51:04.123
We've abandoned the capitol,
and I'm on the run again.

51:04.226 --> 51:05.475
Now, if I am captured or killed,

51:05.594 --> 51:07.793
this rebellion is finished.

51:07.896 --> 51:10.096
Francisco, we're on our way

51:10.181 --> 51:13.799
to New Orleans to set up
a provisional government.

51:13.902 --> 51:16.819
Now, Rusk, you go tell
Houston that both his troops

51:16.938 --> 51:18.938
and the enemy are laughing him to scorn.

51:19.024 --> 51:21.991
He must fight, or I'll
find someone who will.

51:22.210 --> 51:23.576
Yes, sir.

51:23.678 --> 51:26.012
- Francisco, let's go!
- Yes, sir.

51:26.097 --> 51:28.431
Get everyone out before
the Mexicans get here!

51:28.550 --> 51:30.916
All right, young man, I
want to hear every detail.

51:31.019 --> 51:34.187
A petition signed by each and
every man under General Houston

51:34.272 --> 51:36.189
to relieve him of his command...

52:08.256 --> 52:11.957
Lucifer himself is risen
from the bowels of Hades

52:12.060 --> 52:13.810
to tear the turgid flesh

52:13.928 --> 52:17.013
off the bones of all Mexicans...

52:17.098 --> 52:19.315
pluck their eyes and eat their livers,

52:19.434 --> 52:21.150
till their wretched screams

52:21.269 --> 52:25.154
for the angel of death
deafen this godforsaken Earth!

52:25.273 --> 52:27.306
Who are you?

52:27.409 --> 52:30.076
I am the punishment,

52:30.161 --> 52:32.862
here to spite every jumping bean lubricano,

52:32.947 --> 52:36.199
man, woman, and child
from the Texas plains!

52:36.284 --> 52:39.502
This is war, not a crusade.

52:42.207 --> 52:44.957
Had you witnessed the
abominations at the Alamo

52:45.043 --> 52:47.343
and Goliad, you'd think differently.

52:47.462 --> 52:48.928
Goliad?

52:49.013 --> 52:51.964
Damned crazy bastard, speak plain.

52:52.050 --> 52:55.518
They're all dead... murdered.

52:55.637 --> 53:00.056
300 slain... slaughtered after surrender.

53:00.141 --> 53:03.359
So much blood the air
turned to a crimson mist.

53:03.478 --> 53:05.111
Two of my Rangers boys were there.

53:05.196 --> 53:06.512
One had red hair.

53:06.614 --> 53:08.281
The other one rode a big black gelding.

53:08.366 --> 53:09.982
What of them?

53:10.068 --> 53:12.368
Got ambushed.

53:12.487 --> 53:15.071
Shot by so many bullets, shred the skin

53:15.156 --> 53:16.522
clean off their bodies...

53:16.624 --> 53:20.209
splintered their skulls beyond recognition.

53:20.328 --> 53:22.378
All the bodies lay as they fell,

53:22.497 --> 53:27.250
left to rot for the
buzzards and the maggots!

53:27.735 --> 53:29.485
By what right do you have to do this?

53:29.570 --> 53:31.570
I claim the ancient right

53:31.656 --> 53:35.658
by my own death denied
and my brethren butchered!

53:35.743 --> 53:37.877
Your account of Goliad...

53:37.902 --> 53:40.686
I'll need more than a lunatic's word.

53:40.711 --> 53:43.851
I answer to neither man nor God.

53:44.185 --> 53:47.103
There's Chupaldo, Santa Anna's courier.

53:47.221 --> 53:50.139
Why don't you ask him for his account?

53:50.224 --> 53:56.028
Best make haste... fresh
dispatch from Santa Anna himself.

53:56.114 --> 53:58.481
I am a servant to Lucifer!

53:58.566 --> 54:01.701
Death to all brown-skinned Mexican demons!

54:12.719 --> 54:14.976
_

54:27.095 --> 54:33.248
Don Antonio, Burnet has just
escaped with his hand rush.

54:33.351 --> 54:35.718
We were only moments too late.

54:35.803 --> 54:37.720
The bite of the flames,

54:37.805 --> 54:39.722
the sting of the smoke...

54:39.807 --> 54:40.723
don't you feel it?

54:40.808 --> 54:42.691
Feel what, sir?

54:42.777 --> 54:44.259
Death.

54:44.362 --> 54:46.145
Are you hot, Almonte?

54:46.230 --> 54:47.897
Aye.

54:47.982 --> 54:49.365
The flesh of victory

54:49.450 --> 54:51.617
and the cries of the dying...

54:51.736 --> 54:54.703
does it not excite you?

54:54.789 --> 54:57.990
What an ordinary man
feels as pain or revulsion

54:58.075 --> 55:01.377
a real soldier must
learn to feel as pleasure.

55:05.216 --> 55:09.752
This is war,

55:09.837 --> 55:13.923
and the truth is, we enjoy it.

55:17.428 --> 55:20.930
Our enemies are rabble.

55:21.015 --> 55:26.101
The public's gratitude is uncertain.

55:26.187 --> 55:30.105
fickle at best.

55:32.827 --> 55:35.143
A moment like this one...

55:35.246 --> 55:40.866
victory gives purpose
to all our sacrifices...

55:43.254 --> 55:44.954
our suffering.

56:05.393 --> 56:06.806
Jose.

56:08.863 --> 56:10.362
Madam, come with me. Come.

56:10.481 --> 56:12.374
Come. Come. Come. Come. Come.

56:20.241 --> 56:23.859
There is little more I
can add, Mrs. Fincham,

56:23.961 --> 56:29.197
excepting that Truett and
Yancey accounted for themselves

56:29.300 --> 56:32.868
in this campaign with...

56:33.770 --> 56:36.003
what's the fancy word for cojones?

56:36.106 --> 56:37.772
I reckon "valor" is pretty good.

56:37.858 --> 56:39.607
With valor.

56:41.845 --> 56:44.379
You ought to be proud of your son,

56:44.464 --> 56:47.799
as the Rangers hold them in highest regard.

56:50.137 --> 56:51.970
Sincerely, H. Barns.

56:55.642 --> 56:56.942
They was good boys.

57:00.147 --> 57:02.648
Now, read that all back
to me from the start.

57:02.766 --> 57:04.433
It ought to be suitable.

57:07.438 --> 57:09.154
Youse hungry, ain't you?

57:09.273 --> 57:11.106
So hungry my belly button's
gnawing on my backbone.

57:11.191 --> 57:12.524
Go ahead.

57:18.693 --> 57:20.626
That crazy old coot.

57:20.651 --> 57:21.851
I ain't seen nothing like him in
the good lord's Christian world.

57:21.953 --> 57:23.118
Did you see his eyes?

57:23.204 --> 57:25.037
- His... they were dead.
- Oh, yeah.

57:25.122 --> 57:28.457
Just dead... like chunks of black coal.

57:28.964 --> 57:30.546
I don't recall the bible talking

57:30.571 --> 57:31.987
about a demon of his ilk.

57:32.012 --> 57:33.461
Lorca.

57:33.564 --> 57:36.298
- What?
- Lorca.

57:36.400 --> 57:38.286
Lorca?

57:38.654 --> 57:45.636
What is that, some
Injun name for Beelzebub?

57:45.734 --> 57:48.585
It's Cayuga legend.

57:48.616 --> 57:51.617
In ancient times, there
was an Atikapan warrior

57:51.698 --> 57:56.918
who was killed in battle without honor,

57:57.004 --> 57:59.454
and when his spirit rose,

57:59.539 --> 58:02.841
it peeled off the skin
of his barbarian enemies,

58:02.959 --> 58:07.929
and the sun burned them until...

58:08.015 --> 58:12.050
their insides were crisp.

58:12.135 --> 58:14.874
Sweet Jesus, that's what he did.

58:16.456 --> 58:19.257
All right, just so you fellows know,

58:19.376 --> 58:21.610
we chance on his like again,

58:21.712 --> 58:25.380
I will likely soil myself straight away.

58:25.465 --> 58:28.350
Oh, that's more than likely in your case.

58:28.435 --> 58:31.886
I'm not at all sure this
rangering business suits me.

58:37.394 --> 58:40.145
If'n these jackasses won't say it, I will.

58:40.330 --> 58:41.696
That lickspittle Knowles was right.

58:41.798 --> 58:43.698
Our cause is lost, damn it.

58:43.800 --> 58:46.718
The onliest thing we're gonna
find in Texas is our graves.

58:46.837 --> 58:49.304
Turn and run, huh? Is that it, Vern?

58:49.389 --> 58:53.508
Hell no. Turn, run, and fornicate.

58:53.593 --> 58:56.428
Texas is fine country, but Texican women...

58:56.513 --> 58:59.347
they're so ugly they'd back
a buzzard off a gut wagon.

58:59.433 --> 59:02.851
I'd sooner service a sow.

59:02.936 --> 59:04.719
I'd best get back to Paris.

59:04.821 --> 59:07.405
Ooh, Paris, huh? Paris.

59:07.524 --> 59:10.892
In Paris, the missies paint their faces

59:10.994 --> 59:15.747
like dolls, wear bodices,
make their teats spill out,

59:15.866 --> 59:19.284
and the clincer is, they perfume their quim

59:19.369 --> 59:22.036
to smell just like lilac.

59:22.122 --> 59:25.790
You are a sinner, Vern,
marked by a terrible stain.

59:25.876 --> 59:27.709
- Now, your British wench...
- Mm-hmm?

59:27.794 --> 59:29.294
She kind of fleshy...

59:29.479 --> 59:31.029
stinks a little when she sweats,

59:31.147 --> 59:34.699
and she gonna sweat
plenty when I'm riding her.

59:34.818 --> 59:38.403
Course, your best poke, now, in my opinion,

59:38.488 --> 59:40.154
is ports of call of Spain.

59:40.240 --> 59:41.539
Spain?

59:41.658 --> 59:42.707
You been to Spain too, huh?

59:42.826 --> 59:43.825
Don't interrupt.

59:43.910 --> 59:45.192
All right. Continue.

59:45.295 --> 59:48.713
Them skinny little dark-eyed gypsy girls

59:48.832 --> 59:52.250
twirl around on your
pecker like a butter churn.

59:55.088 --> 59:58.556
Yeah, well, you come near my sisters,

59:58.675 --> 01:00:02.760
and I will shoot your
lecherous ass graveyard-dead.

01:00:02.846 --> 01:00:06.047
And you best not so much
as glance at Rebecca,

01:00:06.149 --> 01:00:08.566
that sweet young thing
we rescued at Gonzales.

01:00:08.685 --> 01:00:11.986
I don't care one stringy
bean for that 7x9 gal.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:18.109
Come with me, kid.

01:00:18.194 --> 01:00:19.911
We'll catch a schooner out of New Orleans

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.747
with some of my old swabbies.

01:00:22.866 --> 01:00:25.750
We ain't gonna do nothing
here but die young.

01:01:55.092 --> 01:01:57.026
Sir, it now seems unlikely
the Texans will prevail,

01:01:57.081 --> 01:01:58.761
_

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:01.945
especially since Houston's at
odds with his officer corps.

01:02:02.016 --> 01:02:04.983
Damned Texans.

01:02:05.602 --> 01:02:07.318
Been at odds with them myself.

01:02:07.467 --> 01:02:09.894
So Mister President, should we advise

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:14.212
the Texans to relieve
General Houston of Command?

01:02:14.744 --> 01:02:16.310
As long as I've lived,

01:02:16.413 --> 01:02:18.646
I've been a keen judge of horse flesh.

01:02:18.748 --> 01:02:21.533
What clenches it for me is
just staring in the horse's eyes

01:02:21.618 --> 01:02:24.586
and letting him tell me who he is.

01:02:24.671 --> 01:02:26.821
I first looked into Sam Houston's eyes

01:02:26.923 --> 01:02:29.424
at the Battle of Horseshoe.

01:02:29.509 --> 01:02:31.676
He was 19 years old...

01:02:31.795 --> 01:02:35.396
first on the line, first on the assault,

01:02:35.499 --> 01:02:38.233
first to be marked for death.

01:02:38.335 --> 01:02:40.835
I did not propose to understand him,

01:02:40.937 --> 01:02:44.239
but if there's a way to defeat Santa Anna,

01:02:44.341 --> 01:02:47.942
the only man capable of
doing so is Sam Houston,

01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:50.645
except for me, of course.

01:02:50.947 --> 01:02:53.181
All right there, Charmaine.

01:02:53.283 --> 01:02:55.116
Good night, girl.

01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:08.062
God knows I wanted to
be wrong about Fannin.

01:03:08.165 --> 01:03:09.531
Goldarn it.

01:03:11.952 --> 01:03:12.951
Deaf...

01:03:16.873 --> 01:03:18.790
I'm hungry for counsel.

01:03:18.875 --> 01:03:20.592
I'd welcome yours.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.313
Well, one thing Santa Anna's done...

01:03:25.398 --> 01:03:28.349
he's let every Texian know
that to surrender means death.

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.821
Don't run from him no more.

01:03:33.907 --> 01:03:35.156
Fight him like Comanches.

01:03:35.242 --> 01:03:38.660
You stay close... so close
he can feel your breath.

01:03:38.745 --> 01:03:42.697
You let him know you're always
there and he can't touch you.

01:03:42.782 --> 01:03:46.751
Sooner or later, he's gonna
show you his tender underbelly,

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:48.620
and when he does,

01:03:48.705 --> 01:03:50.905
you take that sword of yours
and you sink it to the hilt.

01:03:51.007 --> 01:03:54.241
You slit him through and through.

01:03:54.344 --> 01:03:57.629
Well, that's all well and good.

01:03:57.714 --> 01:04:01.049
What about his other
generals and their armies?

01:04:01.134 --> 01:04:04.302
Cut the head off the snake, the body dies.

01:04:10.193 --> 01:04:12.727
How do you know this, Francisco?

01:04:12.812 --> 01:04:14.696
I heard it from President
Burnet's own mouth.

01:04:14.781 --> 01:04:17.365
He's fleeing to New Orleans
by way of Galveston Bay.

01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:19.284
And Houston...

01:04:19.402 --> 01:04:20.952
What is his position?

01:04:21.071 --> 01:04:23.655
Somewhere west of the
Sabine River below Gonzales.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.241
Rumors say that he's crazy
and his troops are mutinous.

01:04:27.327 --> 01:04:29.610
Burnet ordered Houston
to meet you on the field.

01:04:29.713 --> 01:04:32.613
That's exactly where I want him.

01:04:32.716 --> 01:04:35.116
We will divide the army
into multiple divisions

01:04:35.218 --> 01:04:38.786
to pursue and destroy what's
left of the rebel army.

01:04:38.888 --> 01:04:39.971
General,

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:42.056
if you will indulge me...

01:04:42.142 --> 01:04:43.808
our many great victories

01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:46.094
have been because we maintain
an overwhelming force.

01:04:46.179 --> 01:04:48.629
His Excellency's strategy is brilliant.

01:04:48.732 --> 01:04:50.765
Ha.

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:53.017
What about President Jackson?

01:04:53.103 --> 01:04:55.770
How can we be certain
that he will not intervene?

01:04:55.855 --> 01:05:02.143
Almonte, Old Hickory
hides behind treaties...

01:05:02.245 --> 01:05:04.812
moves in shadows.

01:05:04.914 --> 01:05:07.782
His stole Florida from
Spain and claims Texas

01:05:07.867 --> 01:05:10.317
was part of the Louisiana Purchase.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.989
Texas is the pathway to the Pacific.

01:05:15.091 --> 01:05:18.126
Jackson wants it all...

01:05:18.211 --> 01:05:22.263
all the way to California.

01:05:22.349 --> 01:05:28.353
Francisco, I reward results.

01:05:28.471 --> 01:05:30.772
Bring me news.

01:05:30.857 --> 01:05:32.190
Yes, Your Excellency.

01:05:32.308 --> 01:05:34.275
Get back to your president!

01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:54.939
A woman with full, meaty arms.

01:06:55.025 --> 01:06:56.741
I like that!

01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.826
Be careful, my friend.

01:06:58.912 --> 01:07:02.143
She's the Presidente General's property.

01:07:02.416 --> 01:07:04.299
Hey, I know you.

01:07:04.384 --> 01:07:06.468
You are Manuel Flores.

01:07:06.553 --> 01:07:08.970
It is me, Hector Ribaldo.

01:07:09.056 --> 01:07:12.424
We played cards. Remember? I won.

01:07:12.509 --> 01:07:13.925
I was proud to take your money

01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:15.927
'cause you joined the filthy rebels.

01:07:16.013 --> 01:07:17.211
You mistake me for someone else.

01:07:17.314 --> 01:07:19.731
No. I am quite certain.

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:22.267
You are a traitorous spy.

01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:39.951
Meet me back here tonight at
the changing of the night guard.

01:07:40.037 --> 01:07:41.586
- Yes.
- I have vital news.

01:07:41.705 --> 01:07:42.587
- Yes. All right.
- Go.

01:07:42.706 --> 01:07:44.589
For Mexico!

01:07:44.708 --> 01:07:45.866
Presidente...

01:08:02.809 --> 01:08:05.060
Everybody pays Francisco.

01:08:16.089 --> 01:08:17.537
You pay me.

01:08:19.576 --> 01:08:21.709
You pay me.

01:08:22.095 --> 01:08:24.679
The rebel Presidente Burnet pays me.

01:08:26.716 --> 01:08:31.752
Even His Excellency Santa Anna himself.

01:08:31.854 --> 01:08:35.256
Everyone pays me.

01:08:35.358 --> 01:08:39.060
Soon, that pirate Houston will pay me too.

01:08:39.145 --> 01:08:40.812
Whoa!

01:08:50.073 --> 01:08:51.572
I almost pissed myself.

01:09:08.174 --> 01:09:09.173
Francisco.

01:09:11.995 --> 01:09:13.027
Who's that?

01:09:16.599 --> 01:09:19.050
This is how Houston pays spies.

01:09:49.233 --> 01:09:50.636
Oh!

01:10:01.778 --> 01:10:03.661
Come on.

01:10:12.622 --> 01:10:13.621
Howdy.

01:10:19.529 --> 01:10:21.462
Come on, Ruthie! Let's get!

01:10:21.548 --> 01:10:23.881
Got me a wrist cuff! Whoo-hoo!

01:10:23.967 --> 01:10:26.713
Mount up, you dang slowpoke!

01:10:27.904 --> 01:10:30.955
Oh... oh, shit!

01:10:31.074 --> 01:10:33.510
Forget the damned horse. We got to get!

01:10:40.083 --> 01:10:42.834
My horse! They stole my horse.

01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:49.441
It's a long walk to Goliad.

01:10:54.681 --> 01:10:56.931
Go. Go. Go.

01:10:57.017 --> 01:10:59.467
Go east to Houston's army.

01:10:59.553 --> 01:11:00.552
God bless you.

01:11:00.637 --> 01:11:02.909
Look out for Comanches.

01:11:17.654 --> 01:11:20.348
Flores.

01:11:20.991 --> 01:11:23.408
- We have no time.
- We go now.

01:11:23.493 --> 01:11:26.722
I'd be better use to Texas staying here.

01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:30.515
Hey, you're coming with me...

01:11:30.733 --> 01:11:32.099
General Houston's orders.

01:11:32.201 --> 01:11:34.151
I don't answer to him.

01:11:36.789 --> 01:11:39.796
If you want to kill Santa
Anna, you will need this.

01:11:41.961 --> 01:11:43.661
You may lose your life.

01:11:43.746 --> 01:11:45.580
What life?

01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:47.281
I'm a Negro born out of
punishment to my mammy,

01:11:47.383 --> 01:11:50.134
growed up to be a whore.

01:11:50.253 --> 01:11:53.554
Tell the general Santa Anna's
pursuing him personally.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.172
It's an obsession.

01:11:55.258 --> 01:11:56.924
Give him these.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:58.092
He'll know. Be vigilant.

01:11:58.177 --> 01:12:00.159
Be safe. Hurry.

01:12:01.181 --> 01:12:02.514
Get back before Santa Anna wakes.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.083
Sticks in my craw... them trash
got off with my wrist cuff.

01:12:22.202 --> 01:12:23.751
You're out a trinket.

01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:25.870
I'm on foot. All right.

01:12:25.955 --> 01:12:28.956
That was a blooded thoroughbred
those wastrels took.

01:12:29.342 --> 01:12:31.041
Raised him from a colt, I did.

01:12:31.144 --> 01:12:32.309
That's why you got your mind

01:12:32.395 --> 01:12:34.478
set on walking all the way to Goliad?

01:12:34.564 --> 01:12:35.896
Do I have a choice?

01:12:36.015 --> 01:12:37.431
And that was no trinket, hard case.

01:12:37.517 --> 01:12:39.350
It was a precious family
heirloom made by my pa

01:12:39.435 --> 01:12:41.519
for me and my brother.

01:12:59.422 --> 01:13:01.338
Still damp.

01:13:01.424 --> 01:13:02.757
She's bleeding out.

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.041
Pissant she-devil bitch...

01:13:04.127 --> 01:13:05.743
I hope so.

01:13:28.067 --> 01:13:30.201
Psst! Psst! Psst!

01:13:30.286 --> 01:13:31.402
Come on!

01:13:34.909 --> 01:13:36.208
You got your wish.

01:13:36.242 --> 01:13:37.825
She wearing my wrist cuff?

01:13:39.929 --> 01:13:41.745
No.

01:13:41.848 --> 01:13:44.849
Pissant bitch.

01:13:44.934 --> 01:13:47.768
You sure you don't want a ride?

01:13:47.887 --> 01:13:50.555
I told you; two grown
men can't ride double.

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:52.106
It ain't dignified.

01:13:52.225 --> 01:13:55.943
Oh, you want dignity or blisters?

01:13:56.062 --> 01:13:57.228
Come on. Yah.

01:14:04.784 --> 01:14:11.612
_

01:14:19.752 --> 01:14:22.553
Comanches! Comanches!

01:14:22.639 --> 01:14:24.138
My rifle!

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:30.895
Hold your fire!

01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:32.296
Hold your fire.

01:14:32.398 --> 01:14:33.931
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:14:34.017 --> 01:14:35.566
I'm gonna be massacred by Comanches.

01:14:35.652 --> 01:14:36.984
Shit, they ain't gonna take me alive.

01:14:37.103 --> 01:14:38.819
Son of a bitch, let's open up on 'em!

01:14:38.938 --> 01:14:40.855
You'll follow orders!

01:15:10.603 --> 01:15:12.687
Fire on me if we fall dead.

01:15:17.677 --> 01:15:19.176
Anderson talks Injun?

01:15:19.278 --> 01:15:21.028
You just figured that out?

01:15:21.147 --> 01:15:23.781
I thought he was kidnapped
by 'em when he was a boy.

01:15:23.866 --> 01:15:26.517
You can smell the stinking savage on him.

01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:28.964
Steady.

01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:04.254
Tell him I'm a chieftain.

01:16:04.357 --> 01:16:07.758
- He's aware.
- Good.

01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:09.977
Tell him to kill me.

01:16:10.062 --> 01:16:11.228
I don't think that's a good idea

01:16:11.314 --> 01:16:13.898
with me standing next to you and all.

01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:15.766
Go ahead.

01:16:15.868 --> 01:16:17.735
Kill me,

01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.989
if you want war the likes
the Comanches have never seen.

01:16:22.074 --> 01:16:26.076
My death brings Yankee
soldiers like buffalo herds.

01:16:26.162 --> 01:16:28.946
The croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.

01:16:29.048 --> 01:16:31.114
Shakespeare does not
translate into Comanche.

01:17:04.033 --> 01:17:06.417
He said that the Cherokee
call you the Raven,

01:17:06.502 --> 01:17:09.119
but the Comanche call you Wild Turkey

01:17:09.205 --> 01:17:12.256
because you drape
yourself in foolish colors

01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:15.586
and you lose your head
when the coyote come.

01:17:15.611 --> 01:17:17.277
What the hell they saying?

01:17:17.363 --> 01:17:19.162
You'd prefer not knowing.

01:17:19.248 --> 01:17:20.697
I would.

01:17:38.534 --> 01:17:40.818
If the Mexicans don't kill you, he will.

01:17:47.643 --> 01:17:48.903
Huh!

01:17:59.271 --> 01:18:03.023
He's hardly 16 and he's already
got two scalps on his lance.

01:18:03.109 --> 01:18:04.908
Friend of yours?

01:18:04.994 --> 01:18:06.143
His name's Yellow Knife.

01:18:06.245 --> 01:18:08.012
He's my son.

01:18:18.656 --> 01:18:20.539
First wagon sets that side of the line!

01:18:20.658 --> 01:18:23.125
Single file all the way to Nueces River!

01:18:43.231 --> 01:18:44.814
Make sure of your spokes.

01:18:44.899 --> 01:18:46.599
Make sure your water
barrels is full to the hilt!

01:18:46.684 --> 01:18:49.068
We pull out for the  in an hour!

01:18:49.187 --> 01:18:51.020
You ain't ready, you're on your own!

01:18:51.105 --> 01:18:53.189
The Santanistas are killing everyone!

01:18:53.274 --> 01:18:54.190
Flee for your lives!

01:18:54.275 --> 01:18:56.025
Make that a 1/2 hour!

01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:57.576
Let's go! Come on! Come on!

01:18:57.695 --> 01:19:00.613
Go! Go!

01:19:00.698 --> 01:19:02.281
Go!

01:19:02.366 --> 01:19:04.166
They're coming!

01:19:04.252 --> 01:19:05.701
Yah! Yah!

01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:11.207
Everyone's skidaddling.

01:19:11.292 --> 01:19:13.742
We're a long cry from Saint Louis.

01:19:13.845 --> 01:19:16.178
Took everything we had to get us this far.

01:19:16.264 --> 01:19:17.847
Whoa.

01:19:17.932 --> 01:19:21.116
There ain't nothing for us back home.

01:19:21.219 --> 01:19:22.718
I told you the day we left,

01:19:22.803 --> 01:19:25.187
I'd follow you to the ends of the Earth.

01:19:25.273 --> 01:19:26.722
Well, this just might be it.

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.793
Should we turn and head back?

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:37.466
No refunds!

01:19:37.552 --> 01:19:40.803
Yes, sir; I'm a tracking
impresario Buckley.

01:19:40.888 --> 01:19:44.023
And you're tracking me.
What can I do for you?

01:19:44.142 --> 01:19:46.725
No refunds... as I've stated.

01:19:46.811 --> 01:19:48.561
Yes, sir.

01:19:48.646 --> 01:19:49.862
I'm looking to...

01:19:49.981 --> 01:19:53.649
interested in a land grant.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.911
With everyone leaving, why are you here?

01:19:55.936 --> 01:19:58.687
- You running from the law?
- No, sir.

01:19:58.773 --> 01:20:01.690
I'm interested in making a fresh start,

01:20:01.776 --> 01:20:04.059
and getting some good land,

01:20:04.161 --> 01:20:09.398
and now, I understand that the Mexican army

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:13.669
is driving all the Americans out.

01:20:13.754 --> 01:20:16.088
Honest settlers have nothing to fear.

01:20:16.207 --> 01:20:19.792
President Santa Anna
protects all legal landowners.

01:20:19.877 --> 01:20:21.043
It's the thieving squatters

01:20:21.128 --> 01:20:23.128
and revolutionaries that get shot.

01:20:23.214 --> 01:20:24.797
I see.

01:20:24.882 --> 01:20:26.682
Do you sweat allegiance
to the Republic of Mexico?

01:20:26.767 --> 01:20:29.885
Yes, sir. For 6¢ an acre, I surely do.

01:20:32.139 --> 01:20:35.757
I can grant 170 acres for farming,

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:38.977
but no whiskey brewing, gun
running, tobacco smuggling,

01:20:39.063 --> 01:20:40.429
or frontier riff-raffing.

01:20:40.531 --> 01:20:42.147
Oh, no, sir. I mean, yes, sir.

01:20:42.233 --> 01:20:44.733
By law, improvements must be made timely,

01:20:44.819 --> 01:20:46.952
but you've been shot in
the flanks with good luck.

01:20:47.071 --> 01:20:49.104
There's a property
cleared with a sturdy cabin

01:20:49.206 --> 01:20:50.873
on it ready to farm.

01:20:50.958 --> 01:20:53.709
I can let you have it for 7 1/2¢ an acre.

01:20:53.794 --> 01:20:55.377
You can pay on time, cash or trade.

01:20:55.463 --> 01:20:57.746
Course, I favor cash.

01:20:57.832 --> 01:21:01.083
Well, I was hoping to pay a
percentage of my crop yield.

01:21:01.168 --> 01:21:04.136
That your big slave yonder?

01:21:04.255 --> 01:21:05.921
Yep.

01:21:06.006 --> 01:21:08.340
Mm, that Sambo's half the
down payment right here.

01:21:08.426 --> 01:21:10.893
Oh, well, I'm gonna need Nate

01:21:10.978 --> 01:21:13.062
to help me plough the field,
I mean, so's I can pay you.

01:21:13.147 --> 01:21:17.299
But I was hoping to pay you
10% of my first year's yield,

01:21:17.401 --> 01:21:20.402
then 20% every year thereafter.

01:21:20.488 --> 01:21:21.970
I'll make an exception.

01:21:22.073 --> 01:21:24.073
But don't tell nobody...

01:21:24.158 --> 01:21:26.191
special circumstance, 'cause
I tend to favor a family man.

01:21:26.277 --> 01:21:27.976
But at the very least, I'll need you to put

01:21:28.079 --> 01:21:29.836
the negro up as collateral.

01:21:30.448 --> 01:21:34.444
I can also allocate another
440 acres for ranching.

01:21:35.269 --> 01:21:36.885
Ranching?

01:21:36.988 --> 01:21:38.737
Comes from the Spaniards.

01:21:38.856 --> 01:21:41.824
Cattle roam free, proliferate,
then sold on the hoof.

01:21:41.909 --> 01:21:45.027
Mexicans been doing it for near 100 years.

01:21:45.112 --> 01:21:46.245
No, I mean, farmland...

01:21:46.364 --> 01:21:47.613
that's what I'm after.

01:21:47.698 --> 01:21:49.582
Name?

01:21:50.318 --> 01:21:53.936
Wykoff... James Wykoff.

01:21:54.021 --> 01:21:58.657
Wykoff. What's your religion?

01:21:58.776 --> 01:22:03.579
Well, now, my wife is
a hard-shelled Baptist.

01:22:03.664 --> 01:22:07.666
Mexico only recognizes
those of Catholic faith.

01:22:07.785 --> 01:22:09.818
Being a Catholic's not too bad;

01:22:10.021 --> 01:22:12.721
you know, a priest instead of a preacher.

01:22:12.807 --> 01:22:16.091
Well, then, we'll do right by him, Mister.

01:22:16.193 --> 01:22:18.360
Signature.

01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:21.985
- It's, uh...
- Yeah.

01:22:32.743 --> 01:22:34.877
Yeah.

01:22:34.962 --> 01:22:36.111
Welcome to Mexico.

01:22:36.213 --> 01:22:37.663
Thank you.

01:23:10.748 --> 01:23:12.882
My God, Jack.

01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:18.153
Oh no.

01:24:23.754 --> 01:24:25.972
Where you planning on heading now?

01:24:29.343 --> 01:24:31.677
With you, I reckon.

01:24:31.762 --> 01:24:36.265
Join up with the Texian army.

01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:39.368
I figure it's what your brother
Samuel would want us to do.

01:24:50.548 --> 01:24:54.533
I must say you're looking mighty dignified.

01:24:54.619 --> 01:24:58.587
Yeah, well, I'd sooner ride
on a burro than with an ass.

01:24:58.673 --> 01:25:00.706
Smells a lot better too.

01:25:00.791 --> 01:25:03.208
I will rectify the stink upon arrival

01:25:03.294 --> 01:25:04.826
to Buckley's way station.

01:25:04.929 --> 01:25:08.597
I can only hope, but I fear
that the ass will linger.

01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:15.771
You're riding that thing pretty well.

01:25:15.856 --> 01:25:21.527
Remember that the author of all this woe

01:25:21.646 --> 01:25:24.313
is tyrant Santa Anna,

01:25:24.398 --> 01:25:28.350
and Sam Houston does nothing.

01:25:28.452 --> 01:25:31.453
I know your families are suffering.

01:25:31.539 --> 01:25:34.657
I know that I brought you here not to run,

01:25:34.742 --> 01:25:36.575
but to fight...

01:25:36.661 --> 01:25:38.460
to stand and fight!

01:25:38.546 --> 01:25:40.329
Stand and fight!

01:25:40.431 --> 01:25:41.880
Stand and fight!

01:25:41.999 --> 01:25:43.832
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:25:43.918 --> 01:25:49.304
Now is the time to avenge the
blood of our fallen heroes!

01:25:49.407 --> 01:25:53.642
Remember to nerve yourselves for battle

01:25:53.728 --> 01:25:57.763
knowing that our cause is just,

01:25:57.848 --> 01:26:01.266
and that our code words will be,

01:26:01.352 --> 01:26:04.570
"Remember the Alamo!"

01:26:04.849 --> 01:26:06.148
Stand and fight!

01:26:06.173 --> 01:26:08.090
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:26:08.175 --> 01:26:11.593
Patriots. Patriots, listen!

01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:14.797
We must stand by General Houston.

01:26:14.882 --> 01:26:19.601
General Houston needs to
stand his ground and fight!

01:26:19.687 --> 01:26:22.337
He needs to stand and fight!

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.020
Stand and fight!

01:26:24.045 --> 01:26:25.378
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:26:25.403 --> 01:26:26.869
Stand and fight!

01:26:26.894 --> 01:26:28.593
I order you men to disperse now!

01:26:28.679 --> 01:26:30.929
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:26:31.015 --> 01:26:32.547
Disperse!

01:26:32.649 --> 01:26:33.648
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:26:33.734 --> 01:26:35.100
Disperse now!

01:26:35.185 --> 01:26:36.151
Stand and fight!

01:26:36.236 --> 01:26:37.269
Now!

01:26:40.057 --> 01:26:45.901
Remember the next time Sam
Houston orders a grave dug...

01:26:45.996 --> 01:26:49.664
- Make way.
- It will be his very own.

01:26:56.223 --> 01:26:58.056
Cold water will cool that hot head.

01:26:58.175 --> 01:27:01.009
Have you no shame, sir?

01:27:01.094 --> 01:27:04.679
You can beat us, but you cannot silence us.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.982
Stand and fight.

01:27:08.068 --> 01:27:09.818
Stand and fight!

01:27:09.903 --> 01:27:12.437
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:27:12.522 --> 01:27:14.823
Stand and fight! Stand and fight!

01:27:19.062 --> 01:27:21.930
Y'all need to cool down,

01:27:22.015 --> 01:27:24.299
'cause we's all that's left.

01:27:24.401 --> 01:27:27.736
Colonel Fannin and his men are gone.

01:27:27.821 --> 01:27:30.305
God damn it to hell.

01:27:30.407 --> 01:27:34.075
Goliad is no more.

01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:36.278
Fannin disobeyed ordered.

01:27:36.363 --> 01:27:41.082
His army did not survive because of it.

01:27:41.168 --> 01:27:43.668
Should we do the same...

01:27:43.787 --> 01:27:46.421
fight each other,

01:27:46.506 --> 01:27:48.206
disobey our General?

01:27:51.962 --> 01:27:54.296
And you, General,

01:27:54.381 --> 01:27:56.181
will you lead your men?

01:28:00.103 --> 01:28:03.355
I feel your scorn,

01:28:03.473 --> 01:28:06.775
and I know I'm the reason for your dissent

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:09.361
when our cause can least afford it.

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:16.701
I was broken when I came to Texas.

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.738
I failed at my marriage

01:28:19.823 --> 01:28:23.325
and turned my back on
the people of Tennessee.

01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:26.861
I took refuge among the Cherokee

01:28:26.963 --> 01:28:30.999
and failed them too.

01:28:31.084 --> 01:28:35.887
I disappointed my family...
tarnished their good name.

01:28:36.006 --> 01:28:38.039
I will atone for all
that when my time comes,

01:28:38.141 --> 01:28:40.392
but I am no longer that man,

01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:43.061
and the reason is Texas.

01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.429
My heart beats strong again.

01:28:44.514 --> 01:28:49.217
My head is clear. I see
a future beckoning us.

01:28:49.319 --> 01:28:53.154
I did not ask to be your general.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:56.191
I was asked by our government to lead you.

01:28:56.276 --> 01:29:00.895
Now, I ask you to follow me east

01:29:00.997 --> 01:29:03.915
where I believe victory awaits us,

01:29:04.034 --> 01:29:08.253
for God has willed that
no tyrant will ever rule.

01:29:08.372 --> 01:29:11.956
Follow me a little longer
down this twisted, bloody road,

01:29:12.042 --> 01:29:14.342
and I will prove it to you.

01:29:17.814 --> 01:29:19.848
By God, I'll prove it.

01:29:59.323 --> 01:30:02.624
Holy Father, please watch
over Truett and Yancey.

01:30:02.726 --> 01:30:04.526
I miss them.

01:30:30.432 --> 01:30:32.032
Come to relieve me, Tom?

01:30:32.128 --> 01:30:33.595
It has been discussed.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:36.011
Before we are outnumbered
why don't we attack?

01:30:36.011 --> 01:30:39.489
Your insubordination
could have cost us dearly.

01:30:39.543 --> 01:30:41.806
Death before betrayal.

01:30:42.614 --> 01:30:47.622
The worst we must do lies yet
ahead, judge me as you will.

01:30:47.647 --> 01:30:49.567
What do you need this for?

01:30:50.512 --> 01:30:52.934
Let me introduce Daphne

01:30:53.215 --> 01:30:56.457
and her equally pretty sister Penelope.

01:30:56.512 --> 01:30:58.074
Alright then let's see how fast we can get

01:30:58.074 --> 01:30:59.590
one of them sisters ready.

01:31:00.964 --> 01:31:02.231
There was a shooting.

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:05.673
And you gonna tell me you are
all just innocent bystanders?

01:31:08.696 --> 01:31:10.801
Necessity requires your help.

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.282
Comanches.

01:31:13.232 --> 01:31:14.727
We end it all now.

01:31:14.783 --> 01:31:16.001
Shoot me first.

01:31:16.026 --> 01:31:17.560
You don't think I will?

01:31:17.585 --> 01:31:19.607
Tomorrow we march!
