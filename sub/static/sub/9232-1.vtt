24:03.000 --> 24:04.797
Oh

24:07.640 --> 24:09.676
Oh, baby

24:31.840 --> 24:36.630
When a man loves a woman

24:38.920 --> 24:42.435
He can do her no wrong

24:42.640 --> 24:47.839
He could never hold another girl

24:49.040 --> 24:53.670
Oh, you tell me
You love me, baby

24:54.360 --> 24:59.070
And gonna hold me tight

24:59.320 --> 25:01.880
Baby, baby

25:05.400 --> 25:10.633
This is a man's

25:11.080 --> 25:14.959
World

25:28.400 --> 25:35.033
In this man's world

25:49.680 --> 25:51.955
- Hurry up.
- Why couldn't I change?

25:52.160 --> 25:55.311
We have only 30 minutes
to get to Billy Ray's.

25:55.520 --> 25:59.274
- We've got it covered.
- Everyone's got it covered, eh?

25:59.480 --> 26:02.358
Hey, whas the matter?
Whas happening?

26:02.560 --> 26:05.358
Jesus, I'm...
Oh, I'm hungry, I'm tired.

26:05.560 --> 26:09.473
- Feed me, hold me, make me happy.
- Wait, I got something.

26:09.680 --> 26:12.558
- What you got in that?
- Vitamins. Cs and B12s.

26:12.760 --> 26:14.478
Cookies and milk.

26:16.560 --> 26:19.074
- Kids' stuff.
- Yeah, keep it that way.

26:19.280 --> 26:23.114
Wanna check? I've been clean
so long my scars have healed.

26:23.320 --> 26:28.075
I'm not checking your arms anymore.
Thas all behind us, eh?

26:28.280 --> 26:30.953
- I look like shit!
- You look like a star!

26:31.160 --> 26:34.311
I don't wanna go to Long Island
to see hicks.

26:34.520 --> 26:39.469
- Billy Ray's been begging to meet you.
- Then why don't he come to see me?

27:34.480 --> 27:37.119
You can hear the whistle blow

27:37.280 --> 27:41.319
A hundred miles

27:41.520 --> 27:43.078
- Billy Ray?
- Shh!

27:52.480 --> 27:54.869
- Billy Ray?
- What?

27:55.120 --> 27:59.238
You remember Rudge Campbell.
This here is the Rose.

27:59.440 --> 28:03.877
- Hi. How you doing? Hello, Sturdily.
- How are you, ma'am?

28:04.080 --> 28:08.596
I wish this cherry was in my band.
You diddle that thing, son?

28:08.800 --> 28:13.999
Oh, my, I don't believe you.
What a fine young piece, here.

28:14.640 --> 28:17.677
Billy Ray, this is Rose.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.236
- Hi, hello.
- Hi, Rose.

28:20.440 --> 28:23.318
Gosh, I've loved you
for so many years.

28:23.520 --> 28:24.794
- You have?
- Yeah.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.959
In fact, she did one of your tunes
on her latest album.

28:29.160 --> 28:33.676
I heard all about it. Is a pleasure
meeting such a dainty lady.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.312
How'd we miss getting together
all this time?

28:37.520 --> 28:39.078
Careful planning.

28:43.400 --> 28:47.154
I look forward to hearing
the rest of your catalogue.

28:47.360 --> 28:50.830
I sang "Huntsville Prison,"
the place went apeshit.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.234
They did.

28:52.440 --> 28:57.195
I've heard a lot of good things
about your record of "Huntsville."

28:57.400 --> 29:01.075
Old Dee here says
is about the best he ever heard.

29:01.280 --> 29:05.114
- Says it even cut Loretta's.
- You never said that.

29:05.320 --> 29:09.233
But I wanna be straight with you.
It didn't show me much.

29:09.440 --> 29:14.070
Not much at all. You think
I'm kidding you, don't you?

29:17.280 --> 29:18.952
I kind of hope so.

29:19.160 --> 29:22.152
This worlďs too full
of bull already, lady.

29:22.360 --> 29:25.158
Now, I don't begrudge
anybody their due...

29:25.360 --> 29:29.319
...but I'd appreciate you not
recording any more of my tunes.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.592
Be different if you knew
what they was about.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.831
Thas how I feel about it.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.477
I wanna say something else.

29:42.760 --> 29:46.514
I don't appreciate you coming here,
talking that trash...

29:46.720 --> 29:48.472
...especially to my son.

29:53.800 --> 29:54.789
Rose!

29:56.560 --> 29:59.199
Shit, you didn't have to do that.

29:59.960 --> 30:03.032
Rose, baby, wait! Rose! Wait!

30:03.240 --> 30:07.153
Come here, listen! Hey, wait!
Listen, that was horrible.

30:07.360 --> 30:11.558
- You let him talk to me like that?
- What was I supposed to do?

30:11.760 --> 30:16.959
If I knew, what the fuck would I
need you for? You just stood there.

30:17.640 --> 30:21.553
Listen, he's an asshole.
What can I tell you, eh?

30:21.760 --> 30:26.754
- That doesn't make me feel any better.
- Don't let that stuff get to you.

30:26.960 --> 30:31.112
What do you care about some
redneck singer? You're the star.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.675
Why didn't you tell him that?

30:35.160 --> 30:37.879
- You're trying to sign him, ain't you?
- What?

30:38.120 --> 30:42.591
- You're trying to sign him.
- I don't believe this.

30:42.800 --> 30:47.112
- She's only kidding, God!
- "Dying to meet me," my ass!

30:47.320 --> 30:49.788
You dragged me here for clout!

30:50.000 --> 30:53.151
- It goddamn well backfired on you!
- Wrong!

30:53.360 --> 30:55.351
- Don't say that.
- Hey, baby...

30:55.560 --> 30:58.870
- Get lost! Fucking lowlifes!
- Calm down, Rose.

30:59.080 --> 31:01.435
Don't you tell me to calm down.

31:01.640 --> 31:05.872
- I'll calm down if you sit on my face.
- Oh, yeah? Is that right?

31:06.080 --> 31:09.436
You're a maniac!
Life's a jack-off dream to you!

31:09.640 --> 31:13.679
Fuck you! Fuck him! Fuck them all!

31:16.160 --> 31:19.436
RUDGE: Come here. Help.
- Goddamn hippie. What happened?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.712
- He passed out.
- Morris, get the first-aid kit.

31:31.760 --> 31:34.752
- This car's taken.
- I wanna get out of here.

31:34.960 --> 31:39.158
So does the cowboy.
Billy Ray owns the car for the night.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.989
I got a great idea.
Let him walk! Let him walk!

31:44.240 --> 31:47.755
- Let him walk!
- Come on, I don't need this.

31:58.960 --> 32:03.670
Don't worry, lady, you just bought
yourself a car and a driver.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.275
Rose, come here, come back!

32:28.480 --> 32:30.675
What are you looking at?

32:34.520 --> 32:39.719
- You know who I am?
- Yeah. You're the Rose.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.672
Is that all?

32:43.760 --> 32:46.877
- Excuse me?
- Is that all you're gonna say?

32:47.640 --> 32:49.153
I don't know...

32:49.360 --> 32:53.512
I always liked your music. A lot.

32:53.800 --> 32:58.271
Is okay, honey, you don't have
to fall down and wet your pants.

33:00.760 --> 33:02.751
My name's Houston.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.072
You from Texas?

33:06.360 --> 33:08.715
Yeah. Waxahachie.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.679
- Waxa... What?
- Waxahachie.

33:11.880 --> 33:16.908
Is got the highest rate per capita
of insanity, suicide and incest...

33:17.120 --> 33:19.873
...of just about any place
in the country.

33:20.760 --> 33:25.072
- Is a fun city on a Saturday night.
- Is that right?

33:25.360 --> 33:29.558
- Where you headed, lady?
- I don't know. Big city.

33:29.960 --> 33:34.317
- New York!
- I picked myself a live one tonight!

33:34.520 --> 33:39.719
- Bright lights, big city.
- You smoking tonight, son.

33:40.160 --> 33:43.232
Here, have one on your old mama.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.237
Hey, thanks.

34:29.159 --> 34:32.152
Jesus Christ,
look what the cat dragged in.

34:38.800 --> 34:43.157
- Those pies sure look good.
- Jello don't look bad either.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.556
We don't serve hippies.

34:50.199 --> 34:54.159
Well, thas okay because
we don't eat them neither.

34:54.440 --> 34:55.953
Arlene?

34:57.480 --> 35:00.438
- Okay, I'll take care of it.
- I would like...

35:00.640 --> 35:03.996
...ham and Swiss on rye,
hold the mayo, and a beer.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.351
I'd like a BLT with the mayo
and some pickles.

35:07.560 --> 35:11.599
Do yourself a big favor
and order something to go, okay?

35:11.800 --> 35:16.749
- We don't want no trouble, you know?
- Suits the shit out of me.

35:17.400 --> 35:20.153
Give us the ham and cheese and...

35:20.400 --> 35:23.153
What the hell are you looking at?

35:25.040 --> 35:29.875
- Damn. Ain't you Paul Newman?
- Get lost, bimbo.

35:31.000 --> 35:35.118
I can put some Danishes in a bag,
and you can go.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.553
- Whatever you've got thas quick.
- Okay.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.193
Hey, Rose...

35:40.440 --> 35:43.398
I'd haul ass if I was you.
Know what I mean?

35:43.600 --> 35:46.637
- As soon as we get our stuff.
- Is coming.

35:46.840 --> 35:51.914
- I'm ready to kick me some ass here!
- Take this sloppy whore out of here!

35:52.120 --> 35:56.750
If your dick is as small as your
brain, you're in a lot of trouble.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.957
Oh, my God, don't!

35:59.160 --> 36:02.277
- Give yourself a break.
- Knock it off!

36:02.480 --> 36:07.554
Take this and go! Please, go!
Just get out of here, please.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.352
Look, go, please.

36:09.560 --> 36:14.315
Show's over, folks. This man's
just gonna continue eating his soup.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.080
Oh, God! Jack, get some ice!

36:18.160 --> 36:23.234
Doggone, you slapped that sucker
silly. I thought that was great.

36:23.480 --> 36:26.950
- It was like being on TV.
- Let the good times roll.

36:34.520 --> 36:38.957
JOURNALIST: Students were arrested
for surrounding a chemical recruiter.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.277
They claimed people
were being burned to death...

36:42.480 --> 36:46.598
Animals. I don't know how
human beings can behave that way.

36:46.800 --> 36:51.749
- Defoliants being sprayed
to destroy Vietnamese food supply...

36:55.280 --> 36:56.759
Houston?

36:58.720 --> 37:00.950
You look like you need a drink.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.359
And you know what?

37:05.040 --> 37:07.349
Your mama's gonna buy you one.

37:07.560 --> 37:12.315
We're gonna put our dancing shoes on
and buy ourselves a drink.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.078
Good deal, Lucille.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.553
George! Big George!

37:30.320 --> 37:33.198
Give me some skin, man.
How you doing?

37:33.400 --> 37:36.756
- Fine, baby.
- My old pal, this is my new pal.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.516
Letter to Daddy

37:41.720 --> 37:45.838
His address is heaven above

37:52.320 --> 37:56.552
- Oh, man! Oh, you freak.
- How are you?

37:58.320 --> 38:00.914
Holy shit, your hair has a hard-on.

38:01.120 --> 38:04.715
- Who's the young Republican?
- Don't dump on him.

38:04.920 --> 38:07.354
He saved my life twice tonight.

38:09.000 --> 38:12.117
The postman said thas best to do

38:15.040 --> 38:16.314
Excuse me, dear.

38:16.520 --> 38:21.275
I've got a little bag, very pure.
No lactose, no quinine.

38:21.480 --> 38:25.155
You could run this horse
to Aquaduct and win.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.717
Mama don't ride the horse no more,
didn't you hear? I'm clean.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.036
- What are you drinking?
- Tequila.

38:32.240 --> 38:36.028
A bottle of tequila, couple
of glasses and no cracks.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.719
Oh, how daring.

38:39.440 --> 38:43.513
I used to be
a big star too, Miss Hudson!

38:43.720 --> 38:45.119
My sister, Henry.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.193
- Weirdsville.
- Come on, relax.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.239
Did you hear about the Polish lesbian?

38:55.440 --> 38:57.351
She liked men!

38:57.560 --> 39:00.028
I love you

39:08.480 --> 39:12.393
Reminds me of a dream
I had once in the Philippines.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.159
Thank you.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.755
Thank you. Thank you.

39:23.960 --> 39:28.192
Thank you, bitch... Butch!
Butch, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

39:28.400 --> 39:32.712
Right on. Thank you.
You're a wonderful audience.

39:32.920 --> 39:36.993
We have somebody in the audience
who tried to sneak in...

39:37.200 --> 39:40.431
...a while ago,
which is impossible for her.

39:40.720 --> 39:45.555
She used to live upstairs. Every night
we'd say, "Are you sleeping?"

39:47.080 --> 39:48.638
She never was.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.917
Where's the $10
you owe me, motherfucker?

39:52.120 --> 39:56.318
How rude! She did
a concert earlier tonight...

39:56.520 --> 40:00.229
...where she slayed thousands,
singing her guts out.

40:00.440 --> 40:03.318
In fact, waiter,
send her a drunk on me.

40:03.520 --> 40:06.034
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome please...

40:06.240 --> 40:11.439
...I'm gonna get in trouble for
pointing her out, the incredible Rose!

40:11.640 --> 40:13.471
All right!

40:13.840 --> 40:15.751
Big mama!

40:23.400 --> 40:26.597
Stand by, Rosie,
we got a surprise for you!

40:26.800 --> 40:29.678
All right, gentlemen.
Hit it for the woman!

40:35.440 --> 40:37.158
Hi, you motherfuckers!

40:37.640 --> 40:41.428
I made it! That drag queen's doing me!

40:41.640 --> 40:44.074
Slippin' in right in time

40:44.400 --> 40:46.994
Here comes the stripper
Bringing on the night

40:49.280 --> 40:51.430
Here comes the boys
Faces hidden from the night

40:51.880 --> 40:53.279
Walk through the shadows

40:58.000 --> 41:00.639
They got one thing in common

41:00.880 --> 41:03.110
They got the fire down below

41:03.320 --> 41:06.551
- Hands off!
- Come on. Come on.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.912
Here come the banker
The lawyer and the cop

41:17.280 --> 41:20.750
One thing for certain
Is never gonna stop

41:21.000 --> 41:25.312
When it all gets too heavy
They come and they go

41:27.960 --> 41:29.279
One thing in common

41:34.920 --> 41:38.230
It happens in Vegas, Moline

41:39.440 --> 41:41.112
Diana!

41:42.480 --> 41:45.677
Went on yesterday
Is going on tonight

41:45.960 --> 41:49.475
And somewhere there's somebody
Treatin' somebody right

41:50.560 --> 41:55.236
Hello, gorgeous!
Talk about your secondhand Rose, huh?

42:02.360 --> 42:04.396
Slippin' out of sight

42:08.200 --> 42:09.474
They come and go

42:20.840 --> 42:24.276
Are you in town for good, or for fun?

42:26.240 --> 42:28.800
It happens out in Vegas, Moline

42:29.560 --> 42:32.791
On the blue-blood streets of Boston
In Berkley, out in Queens

42:33.400 --> 42:36.756
Went on yesterday
Is going on tonight

42:37.000 --> 42:40.072
Somewhere there's somebody
Treatin' somebody right

42:44.160 --> 42:47.357
Walk the streets
I'll find you anytime

42:48.000 --> 42:51.072
Where the streetlights flicker
Bringing on the night

42:51.560 --> 42:54.597
I'll be slipping into darkness
Slippin' out of sight

42:55.400 --> 42:59.029
Oh, through the darkness
Oh, they come and they go

42:59.240 --> 43:02.038
Oh, they come and they go

43:04.320 --> 43:07.357
They got the fire down below

43:09.000 --> 43:11.639
They got one thing in common

43:12.320 --> 43:15.517
They got the fire down below

43:33.400 --> 43:35.755
Far out! Far-fucking-out!

44:03.120 --> 44:07.750
- Are you trying to get in my bloomers?
- Working on it.

44:07.960 --> 44:11.953
You brown-eyed motherfucker,
where you been all my life?

44:42.600 --> 44:44.989
Ever polite, honey, ever polite.

44:45.240 --> 44:49.438
- Thas the way my mama taught me.
- Which mama was that, baby?

44:49.640 --> 44:51.631
Look at this place.

44:51.840 --> 44:55.913
I'm rich. I could buy
the whole damn place if I wanted to.

44:56.120 --> 44:59.430
- You like being rich?
- I sure do. I do.

44:59.640 --> 45:02.837
Someone spread the rumor
being rich is a drag.

45:03.040 --> 45:05.838
Whoever spread that rumor
is dead broke.

45:06.040 --> 45:07.996
- You ever rich?
- Not like that.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.431
But once I went down
the Little Big Horn River.

45:11.640 --> 45:16.589
I never saw another soul for six days.
Felt like I owned the whole thing.

45:16.960 --> 45:20.953
- Were you really alone for six days?
- Yeah.

45:23.360 --> 45:26.033
I ain't been alone in about 300 years.

45:26.240 --> 45:30.153
- Three hundred years?
- Yeah, 300 years.

45:42.360 --> 45:45.716
You're something else, lady.
Something else.

45:45.920 --> 45:47.558
Mister...

45:47.960 --> 45:50.554
...so are you.

45:57.520 --> 46:00.159
Thank you. This is very good.

46:03.160 --> 46:07.153
- Do you think I'm sexy?
- You kidding?

46:07.520 --> 46:10.557
Come on, the Rose wants to know.

46:11.040 --> 46:16.160
Anybody who talks about themselves
in the third person is Looney Tunes.

46:18.640 --> 46:23.839
- You don't fool around, do you?
- I don't have the time.

46:24.760 --> 46:26.751
You have time for me?

46:28.560 --> 46:33.714
You wanna go steady? You wanna
go steady? Do you? Do you?

46:33.920 --> 46:39.119
I'll stop at a five-and-dime, get you
a box of chocolate-covered cherries.

46:39.440 --> 46:42.955
Oh, God, do you remember them?

46:43.680 --> 46:47.992
Wrapped up in gold paper,
with cracked hearts all over them?

46:48.200 --> 46:52.716
On Valentine's Day, the boys
and girls used to exchange them and...

46:52.920 --> 46:57.755
Oh, I wish I'd known you
when I was in high school.

47:01.080 --> 47:03.355
I wish you had too.

47:06.760 --> 47:11.356
I wish I had a girl
with hair this color.

47:12.040 --> 47:14.838
I don't need charity
off trash like you.

47:15.040 --> 47:17.156
Come on, what is it?

47:19.000 --> 47:20.718
Whas the matter?

47:20.920 --> 47:24.959
Oh, I hate this mushy love stuff, man!

47:25.160 --> 47:27.958
Wake me up when the killing starts!

47:32.960 --> 47:35.758
I'll tell you something...

47:36.280 --> 47:40.159
...about me thas so weird,
you won't even believe it.

47:41.080 --> 47:44.152
- Yes, I will.
- No, you won't.

47:44.360 --> 47:46.157
I bet you I will.

47:48.040 --> 47:49.553
All right.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.951
Here goes.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.999
Once...

47:58.240 --> 48:01.152
...when I was in high school...

48:02.080 --> 48:06.358
...I got drunk one night, and I...

48:08.440 --> 48:12.353
I took on the whole football team.

48:14.080 --> 48:17.231
You always tell
Christmas stories like this?

48:17.440 --> 48:21.558
- You're shocked, ain't you?
- No, I ain't shocked.

48:23.360 --> 48:26.158
I woke up on the 50-yard line.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.949
I'd hate to tell you
some of the places I woke up.

48:35.520 --> 48:39.991
You know, I waited all my life
to go back there...

48:40.200 --> 48:44.159
...like somebody, like a star.

48:44.400 --> 48:47.949
I just wanna hear
that hometown applause.

48:48.160 --> 48:53.280
I want them to push and scream
and scratch and bite...

48:53.480 --> 48:56.438
...to get a view of
the one and only Rose.

48:56.640 --> 49:00.599
- She'll shove it right in their teeth.
- Shove what?

49:00.800 --> 49:03.189
Herself. Me.

49:03.440 --> 49:06.557
Old rich and famous me.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.548
[PHONE RINGS]

49:32.680 --> 49:36.559
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus, I'm sorry.

49:36.760 --> 49:39.433
No, I'll be there as soon as I can.

49:39.640 --> 49:40.834
I was wrong.

49:41.040 --> 49:43.156
I was wrong.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.879
Oh, God! I was supposed
to be at a recording session.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.951
Oh, Jesus.

49:52.560 --> 49:54.755
God, am I gonna get it.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.156
Do I look old?

50:05.920 --> 50:07.956
Where is everybody?

50:23.680 --> 50:25.750
Hey, baby, whas shaking?

50:27.160 --> 50:28.673
Where were you?

50:28.880 --> 50:31.678
Rudge, this is my friend Houston Dyer.

50:31.920 --> 50:35.356
Houston, this is my manager,
Rudge Campbell.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.949
Howdy, nice to meet you, sir.

50:38.280 --> 50:43.149
Terrific! Keep everybody waiting
for hours, what do we get in return?

50:44.200 --> 50:46.555
A fucking cowboy.

50:49.280 --> 50:53.193
They said you'd never show up.
I said, "She'll show up."

50:53.400 --> 50:56.153
And she shows.
Not one or two hours late...

50:56.360 --> 50:59.830
...but five fucking hours
and $3000 late.

51:00.040 --> 51:03.635
These are real, live people
you're talking to.

51:03.840 --> 51:07.355
We go back to when
you were still in high school!

51:07.560 --> 51:10.358
We're in business.
I talk any way I like!

51:10.560 --> 51:15.156
Miss Me-Give-Me-Mine treats me
any way she likes, so you butt out!

51:17.760 --> 51:20.911
Don't you talk that trash
to him or to me.

51:21.120 --> 51:23.634
I'm very sorry, my mistake.

51:23.840 --> 51:27.355
I thought we had an appointment
to make some money.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.357
What a bummer.

51:51.680 --> 51:55.958
Shook you up, huh?
Thas his favorite trick.

52:00.080 --> 52:01.354
You know...

52:03.440 --> 52:06.000
...I don't understand them.
- I was late...

52:06.240 --> 52:09.596
...and he was pissed off,
so he did a show about it!

52:09.800 --> 52:12.234
Thas all we ever do around here.

52:12.440 --> 52:15.989
- Got a scuzzy mouth.
- Shut up! He's a fucking magician.

52:16.200 --> 52:19.590
He don't need help
from meat in a chauffeur's cap.

52:32.160 --> 52:33.752
Jesus.

52:37.560 --> 52:40.358
Houston! Houston!

52:40.600 --> 52:42.158
Come here!

52:45.920 --> 52:47.751
She can have it now.

52:48.680 --> 52:50.796
- Dyer.
- Rose, close that door.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.037
- I gotta get out.
- Dyer, I can't let you go.

52:54.240 --> 52:57.835
He's right about you.
Miss Me-Give-Me-Mine.

52:58.040 --> 53:02.158
- I want Chinese, and I want it now!
- Close that fucking door.

53:02.640 --> 53:04.835
- I'm going, Rose!
- No!

53:08.640 --> 53:13.270
- This ain't gonna work!
- You're not going anywhere without me.

53:13.760 --> 53:15.239
- Get out!
- Never.

53:15.440 --> 53:17.954
- Rose, I said get out.
- Make me!

53:18.160 --> 53:23.075
I don't need this shit, lady.
I never did, I never fucking did!

53:23.280 --> 53:25.157
Asshole, move your car!

53:25.360 --> 53:27.954
I didn't come back for some
hootchy-kootchy woman to blow my mind!

53:28.200 --> 53:29.474
I ain't a hootchy-kootchy woman!

53:34.440 --> 53:38.319
You can't park
in the middle of the street!

53:38.520 --> 53:42.195
For chrissake, get that
goddamn car out of here!

53:42.400 --> 53:46.871
Get that goddamn thing out of here,
for chrissake!

53:47.080 --> 53:51.073
- Move it! Whas wrong with you?
- Oh, shut up! Goddamn it!

53:54.840 --> 53:56.876
Come here, you crazy lady!

53:57.280 --> 53:59.396
Dyer! Dyer!

53:59.600 --> 54:01.830
Men, my favorite!

54:02.040 --> 54:04.838
Dyer! You see a guy come through here?

54:05.040 --> 54:09.670
- Thas all we got here!
- Houston Dyer, report to the Rose!

54:09.880 --> 54:12.633
- Hey, miss!
- My Lord, look at this.

54:13.400 --> 54:16.278
- Hey, lady!
- Dyer! Houston!

54:16.720 --> 54:19.439
Get the hell out of here!
What is this?

54:19.640 --> 54:24.236
I picked myself a peck of pickled
peppers this time. Houston Dyer!

54:24.760 --> 54:27.752
Don't hide it till I've tried it!

54:27.960 --> 54:31.635
You keep watering that,
I know is gonna grow.

54:31.840 --> 54:36.914
Let her stay. We need a change
in atmosphere. Wanna borrow my towel?

54:38.120 --> 54:41.032
- Houston?
MAN: She has three-and-a-half rooms.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.958
There you are!

54:43.440 --> 54:46.000
All right, everybody out!

54:46.200 --> 54:50.876
You can go in the main lounge
and shuffleboard on the forward deck.

54:51.080 --> 54:54.993
- Why don't you just leave?
- This one came as a raccoon.

54:55.200 --> 54:59.352
Cha-cha into the casino.
There will be a masquerade ball.

54:59.560 --> 55:01.949
Thank you so much for coming.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.995
If I don't get a kind word
in the next four seconds...

55:07.200 --> 55:09.350
...I'm gonna do something fierce.

55:11.280 --> 55:14.352
And one... and two... and...

55:14.560 --> 55:18.758
At ease, sailor, at ease.
Take a break.

55:20.200 --> 55:21.758
Oh, Dyer...

55:22.160 --> 55:24.151
...I'm awful sorry.

55:24.680 --> 55:26.750
I got a big mouth.

55:31.960 --> 55:36.954
Gee, is kind of nice in here.
Are all steam rooms like this?

55:42.720 --> 55:45.359
Why do you wanna walk out on me?

55:52.040 --> 55:55.350
It ain't you so much
as it is your life.

55:56.400 --> 55:59.358
I mean, is like a grenade range.

56:02.040 --> 56:04.759
And is me too.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.234
Lordy.

56:07.720 --> 56:10.154
What do you mean is you too?

56:11.280 --> 56:13.236
Oh, a mystery...

56:13.440 --> 56:17.353
Come on, Houston,
I told you about the football team.

56:23.400 --> 56:24.958
You see...

56:26.680 --> 56:29.240
...I'm a sergeant in the fucking Army.

56:29.720 --> 56:34.316
I'm AWOL. I shoulďve been back
at Fort Campbell three weeks ago.

56:34.520 --> 56:39.514
- You mean, you ain't no chauffeur?
- No, ma'am. No, ma'am.

56:39.720 --> 56:44.919
- No chauffeur, not the Lone Ranger.
- I've been had.

56:46.400 --> 56:50.359
Sometimes I get scared.
Maybe the Army's all I know.

56:52.200 --> 56:55.431
- I mean, I've been in since I was 18.
- 18?

56:55.640 --> 56:59.952
Yeah, me and Vincent Birkham,
we joined on my birthday.

57:00.560 --> 57:04.838
You know, hot food,
roof over my head...

57:05.040 --> 57:07.952
...socks all lined up in a row.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.955
It was a beautiful thing.

57:13.480 --> 57:15.914
And then it kind of went sour.

57:17.400 --> 57:21.154
You thinking about walking away
from the Army for good?

57:26.000 --> 57:27.353
Yeah.

57:28.880 --> 57:34.079
Listen, you don't have to go back.
You don't. You can stay with me.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.548
I'll take real good care of you.

57:41.440 --> 57:44.034
Okay, lady, les go! Party's over.

57:44.400 --> 57:46.994
I had a good time. I sure did.

57:47.200 --> 57:52.399
- You got it. Whas her name? Jean?
- We've had enough of this lark.

57:52.600 --> 57:56.991
Rudge! After the Florida show,
we're canceling all our bookings.

57:57.200 --> 57:59.919
- Whas wrong now?
- Everything.

58:00.120 --> 58:04.511
- My life is like a grenade range.
- Thas specific, anyway.

58:04.720 --> 58:08.349
- I'm gonna wait in the car.
- Can I have your autograph?

58:08.600 --> 58:11.353
Why don't you tell the truth?

58:11.600 --> 58:15.673
You find some hustler,
you're with him a fast ten minutes.

58:15.880 --> 58:18.713
Because he hasn't
picked your pocket yet...

58:18.920 --> 58:22.959
...or said you look like
Petunia Pig, he's a white knight!

58:23.160 --> 58:28.154
There's few real men left in the world.
I got one and I'm gonna hang on.

58:28.360 --> 58:33.480
After that Florida show, he and I
are going away together. That is that.

58:33.680 --> 58:36.399
They'll bury you
in the remainder racks!

58:36.600 --> 58:39.398
I'll take my chances. Give me my bag.

58:39.680 --> 58:43.958
- Wait! How does he feel about it?
- He don't know about it yet.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.552
- Here we go again.
- Les get out of here.

58:53.240 --> 58:57.836
You can't just leave. You're crazy.
You got your whole career.

58:58.040 --> 59:01.999
You stay with me until after
I do that show back home...

59:02.200 --> 59:07.149
...and I'll go anywhere with you.
The woods, the mountaintop, anywhere.

59:07.360 --> 59:09.794
Out of the state? Out of sight?

59:10.000 --> 59:13.549
- How about out of the country?
- Out of the world.

59:15.120 --> 59:17.395
Oh, Rose, Rose!

59:18.440 --> 59:19.998
You gotta be wacko!

59:20.240 --> 59:23.755
Yeah, I know.
What are you gonna do about it?

59:24.360 --> 59:26.157
You're in love.

59:41.800 --> 59:45.349
Yeah, all right. Okay, okay.

59:47.840 --> 59:50.752
MAN: I met this chick
and I let her backstage.

59:54.040 --> 59:57.237
WOMAN: Ill start moving
and tell us something else.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:01.353
Great. Arrangements? Marvelous.
Marvelous, yeah.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.429
Come on now, just concentrate.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:07.950
Different strokes for different folks.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:11.594
- What?
- The Ouija girls.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:14.360
Oh, right, right.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.353
Here goes.

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.758
Sipping whiskey.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.551
- Lynchburg, Tennessee.
- Population: 517.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.956
Waco, Texas. Population: 94,632.

01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.959
Everybody wants to be a shit-kicker.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.352
- You and Rose are getting along, eh?
- Yeah.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:05.759
I'm just... I'm just really glad
she's found a friend at last.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.150
I've seen them come and go.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:14.355
And I've always hoped that one
might stick. Give her an anchor.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.670
You don't think
she's drinking too much, do you?

01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.511
You been on the road
with a rock 'n' roll band?

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.314
- First time.
- You're gonna love it.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.514
Why don't you let me
Call you sweetheart

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.109
I'm in love with you

01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.112
Let me hear you whisper

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.676
That you love me too

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.992
Keep the love burning

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.151
In your eyes

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:11.949
Let me call you...

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.350
Where am I?

01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.230
I never know where the fuck I am.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:27.752
All these fucking clouds look alike.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.758
Easy, honey.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.551
Sweet Rosie.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:48.719
Welcome to rock 'n' roll.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.990
And no two-bit fascist

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.394
Gonna shoot us down

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.871
Come on, children

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:14.390
Bring your guns, bring your guns
To town

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.228
Keep on rockin'

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.673
Keep on rockin'
Keep on rockin'

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.037
Keep on, rock 'n' roll

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:42.715
Gonna never die

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.118
Thank you, St. Louis!

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:57.118
Everything okay here? Everything okay?

01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:02.155
Hey, Don! What a great job.
Thank you very much. How was it?

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.955
Chief, would you like
to come to meet Rose?

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:11.958
Rose? She's a little bit high. Rose?

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:17.314
Police Chief Morrison and his wife.
He gave us extra protection tonight.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:22.230
- You have a generous manager.
- I've heard Rudgie called many things.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:25.750
First time I've heard him
called generous.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.157
- Don! Dennis! Rose?
- There you are.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:32.636
Don Franks,
handling Midwest distribution.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:37.152
Give me a hankie, what a shvitz.
Honey, you were sensational.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.909
Incredible, insane!
The band was so together.

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.556
You just put me away. Really.
I wet my pants.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.799
- Don't you wanna go and change?
- My shorts were in flames!

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.275
- Rose is tired.
- How can you tell?

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:53.357
He's a good friend of ours.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.155
- Rack jobbers rule.
- They don't rule me, I'm sorry.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.788
What are you doing here?
Don't keep telling her "tired."

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.630
She's got commitments,
and these people are important.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.469
- The lady needs a rest!
- Yeah, when I tell her!

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:15.319
And when she's finished her business.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.752
- What song are you singing now?
- Having a word with your friend.

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:24.954
I'm really tired, I'll see you
on the plane tomorrow. Take me to bed.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.673
You get a photo?
I'm not sleeping over.

01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:32.350
Call me tomorrow,
I've got something extra for you.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:35.757
No, thas cool.
Dennis got you covered.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.757
Keep it cool, man. Keep it cool, huh?

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.234
Hey, Dennis.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.591
- They don't know when this will clear.
- Christ.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.630
- Can't we even wait on the plane?
- I'll check it out, all right?

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.829
Fine, fine.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:20.555
- Do you want your fortune told?
- No, thanks.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.718
- Let me see your tongue.
- Beg your pardon?

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.755
Come on, don't be a putz,
let me see your tongue.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.760
Come on, let me see your real tongue.

01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.476
Thas the tongue I know.

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.036
Toots, you look a little
green around the gills.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:44.836
- Drink this. Vitamins and minerals.
- Thas really far out.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.352
Drink it, honey. You need it.
You gotta keep up your strength.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.553
Oh, drink it, come on.
Don't be a chump. Drink it.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.395
My brave boy. I'll get you
straightened out when we go away.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:03.354
- I think this'll do it.
- I think thall do it, for sure.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.758
Terrible, ain't it?

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.435
- Who ordered a dozen raw eggs?
- Right here!

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.949
- And a dozen raw beers!
- Yeah!

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.028
Houston, look.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:23.915
Look what the Army did
to those poor, little boys.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:31.359
- You better let them little boys be.
- You know me better than that by now.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.109
Hey, colonel!

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.958
Colonel!

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.759
I think she's talking to you.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.674
- You talking to me?
- You know I am.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:51.190
Come on over here.
Airborne, Houston, airborne.

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.997
Okay, everyone, we're getting
our clearance for Memphis soon.

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:16.158
The fog has lifted. All right?

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.633
- Who's this, then?
- Rudge, this is Mal. This is Mal.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.550
He's gonna be traveling with me,
my personal bodyguard and masseur.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.557
MAN:
We're out of ice.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.960
This troupe gets bigger every day.

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.236
And if free don't mean

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.877
For nothing

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.754
I sold my soul to rock 'n' roll

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.117
I bought these devil chains

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.828
My baby wants me home

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.189
Can't refuse him

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.639
The one that goes from heaven

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.310
Need a short vacation

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:33.395
Forever, forever, forever

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:39.194
Keep on going
Till I'm gone

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:45.475
Bought these devil chains

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.319
Oh, baby wants me home

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.390
Can't refuse him

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.914
The one that goes from heaven

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.516
Straight to Houston, ho

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.673
Did you like it

01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:15.197
Was it good

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.157
Did you like it

01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:30.349
Aah

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:45.918
Sold my soul to rock 'n' roll

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.834
Is time to take that train

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.438
To Houston

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.672
The one that goes from heaven

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.312
MAN:
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.438
What the hell's the matter
with security?

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:06.228
MAN:
Fuck!

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:14.273
- Christ, man.
- Where are the roadies?

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:17.239
Probably backstage with the food.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.235
Oh, baby, baby.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.431
Oh, I'm so hot.

01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.470
Oh, Sarah. Goddamn, how you been?

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.712
Houston, this is Sarah Willingham.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:03.035
Sarah, this is...
This is Houston Dyer.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.589
Looks more like Galveston to me.

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:13.874
SARAH: God, your hair looks beautiful.
ROSE: It looks very wet.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.389
- The color's wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.478
- Does that feel good?
- Don't be a nit.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:24.629
Of course it feels good.
Now, Sarah, don't get carried away...

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:29.834
You're getting it all over my face.
You have a license for this, madam?

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.634
This is wonderful.

01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.837
Oh, girl.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.516
- Sarah...
- What?

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:45.635
Oh, Sarah, you're gonna get me
all fucked up again.

01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:04.834
- Rudge told me you were fucked up.
- I love how you say "fuck."

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.675
Sounds like tea and crumpets
at the Ritz-Carlton.

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.431
I missed you.

01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:22.439
I got to tell you something.
Something wonderful's happened to me.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.037
That guy? That guy Houston Dyer?

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.279
A real man.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.473
He's solid, he's not like any man
I ever met in my life.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.874
He likes me.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:40.517
He doesn't care what I did before,
what I am, who I am.

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:43.439
Sarah, he makes me so happy.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:46.231
I can see.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.836
Yeah, I guess it shows.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:56.035
Well, mine was a poetry teacher
at Bennington.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.632
He was 30 and I was 18.

01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:07.833
I'm jealous of you, Rose.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:13.233
I want what you have.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.830
You're beautiful.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.835
I love you.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.631
Why?! Why?!

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.032
- No, listen to me. Let me explain!
- Shut up!

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.519
You fuck! Why don't you listen to me?!

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.429
- Rose, Rose!
- You pig! You stupid...

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.911
Oh, God!

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.828
I'm sorry. Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.670
Baby, baby, I love you so much.

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.917
- Just hold on.
- Why can't you find him?

01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:16.874
- Rudge, is Bernie.
- Why the hell can't you find him?

01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.117
Excuse me, excuse me!
Madeleine, my dear...

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.118
...would you mind going and
brushing your hair?

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:26.198
- Why can't you find him?
- I didn't lose him!

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:28.960
I ain't so sure about that. Come on.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:32.118
- Where you going?
- You can't find him, I will.

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:36.359
We're going to Florida,
hometown, you'll show them all!

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:41.517
MAN: Step right up, folks,
the show is about to start.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:45.429
See the prettiest girls
this side of the Mississippi.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:47.039
I know you.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.159
Hey! Is there a dude in here
by the name of Houston Dyer?

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.954
MEN:
Get the hell out of here.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:03.836
I hope your goddamn chickens die.
You lousy farmers!

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.079
MAN: What the hell was that?
WOMAN: Did you see her hair?

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:14.279
Oh, God, I was such a good lay.
How could he just go off and leave me?

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.439
- Tell me, Mal, whas wrong with me?
- Nothing.

01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:24.434
I should have gone to college.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.914
- Wait a minute, follow me.
- Whoa, hold it.

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.032
I'll clear the area
for you there, trooper.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.435
Oh, the hell with him.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.433
I don't give a damn about him, anyway.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:58.633
Positive?

01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.433
Nope.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:09.234
Well, what are we gonna do now?

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:15.078
Sonny, there's only
one thing left to do.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:16.429
Whas that?

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.792
Go home.

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.438
- Did you find her?
- The only thing I do have is that...

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:38.679
...she and Mal tore up downtown
last night looking for Dyer.

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:43.431
They never went back to the hotel.
Black coffee, honey.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.954
She'd better show,
or I'll break her fucking feathers!

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:00.434
God, look at this.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:04.599
Oh, Lord!

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:08.156
- Feels funny, huh?
- It sure feels funny.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.117
- Does it look littler?
- Oh, you said it.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.834
Littler and poorer...

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.629
...and dirtier...

01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:20.032
...and meaner.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:24.839
This is where I went to high school.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:29.436
Football field...

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:35.031
Got me some memories
of the football field.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:43.273
This is the vacant lot
where I got my first kiss.

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:46.320
- From Eddie Pompadour.
- Eddie Pompadour?

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.479
Eddie-fucking-Pompadour, dear.
I was 12 years old.

01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:54.195
That wasn't his real name,
but I called him that...

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:59.155
...because he had this Elvis Presley
complex that went to his hair.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:03.831
A little swoop in the front.
I thought he was it, man.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.832

Well, don't worry. She'll be here.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:07.030
She needs this concert.
She'd crawl on her knees to get here.

- Yeah. Yeah, I see.

Yeah, and...

I, uh...

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.799
I don't want to hurt the band none,
you know. So I think...

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:51.235
...I think is a good idea

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:55.117

- Well, it must be my contract.
- Right. Good.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.238
I've been reading it,
and I've been thinking about it.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:35.911
For the last few nights
I've thought about us...

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.432
...about all of those
filthy holes we played.

01:26:41.120 --> 01:26:46.319
All the hustlers I had to bargain with
every time you opened your mouth.

01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.436
And not all for you.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.515
It was for me too, you see,
because I loved it.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:58.350
I loved it. I loved getting hold
of a selfish, hopeless junkie...

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.032
...and turning her into a performer
they'd mortgage Australia for.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:09.469
Do you wanna play Brisbane? London?
You wanna play Paris? Tokyo?

01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:17.830

I woke up and I thought:

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.236
"Fuck all this.

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:28.514
Did we go down the road together
or not?" And I came to a decision.

Either you fulfill all the commitments
you asked me to make...

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:35.435

- You're crazy.

- The concers off.
- What do you mean?

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.634
I'm the promoter. If I wanna
blow it, I damn well will.

01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.436
Everyone will get their money back,
I'll pay them myself. By the way...

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:06.429
...get yourself another manager.
