WEBVTT

00:01.350 --> 00:04.119
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.153 --> 00:06.621
(watch beeping)

00:06.655 --> 00:10.091
Oh! Good thing I set my watch,
otherwise I would've forgot

00:10.092 --> 00:12.610
something very important I have
to do right at this very minute.

00:12.611 --> 00:13.945
Yeah, what's that, Wood?

00:15.821 --> 00:19.617
Did you... need to take
some medication?

00:19.618 --> 00:21.520
No.

00:23.005 --> 00:26.224
Well, uh... maybe you're
supposed to call somebody, huh?

00:26.226 --> 00:28.826
No. No...

00:28.827 --> 00:30.095
Perhaps you had an appointment?

00:30.096 --> 00:32.464
Maybe if I just
don't think about it,

00:32.497 --> 00:34.966
it'll come to me.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.350
I wouldn't worry
about it, Wood.

00:36.351 --> 00:37.619
As you get older, you know,

00:37.620 --> 00:39.420
the memory starts to go a bit.

00:39.421 --> 00:41.155
Myself, I was
thinking about maybe

00:41.156 --> 00:43.326
signing up for one of
those memory classes.

00:43.409 --> 00:45.509
That's it, my memory class!

00:48.180 --> 00:49.614
Today's graduation.

00:53.119 --> 00:55.103
Oh, where'd I park?

00:55.137 --> 00:58.139
Oh, yeah.
See, it's working.

Evening, everybody.

01:45.338 --> 01:46.871
ALL:
Norm!

01:46.889 --> 01:48.773
How's life treating you, Norm?

01:48.808 --> 01:49.888
Well, Sammy, it's not.

01:49.909 --> 01:52.043
So I sure hope you are.

01:52.077 --> 01:53.644
Where's Woody?

01:53.645 --> 01:55.163
Oh, his father-in-law
took him and Kelly

01:55.164 --> 01:56.998
to see the Boston Symphony.
Ah!

01:56.999 --> 01:58.199
Probably thought Woody needed

01:58.200 --> 02:00.001
a little musical culture.
Yeah.

02:00.002 --> 02:02.887
The Boston Symphony is offering
"Mahler's Third" this evening,

02:02.888 --> 02:04.655
one of my absolute favourites.

02:04.690 --> 02:08.493
It always brings salt water
to Lilith's eyes.

02:08.526 --> 02:10.261
Tears to you and me,

02:10.295 --> 02:13.331
saline secretions to her.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.318
"Mahler's Third" takes over
an hour and a half by itself.

02:16.352 --> 02:19.120
The adagio alone is endless.

02:21.324 --> 02:22.857
I beg your pardon.

02:22.858 --> 02:25.177
Since when do you know anything
about classical music?

02:25.178 --> 02:27.228
Since I was two years old.

02:27.262 --> 02:29.430
My mother was a concert cellist.

02:29.431 --> 02:32.000
I used to turn the pages for her
while she was practicing.

02:32.001 --> 02:33.501
And I loathe Mahler.

02:33.502 --> 02:35.253
Well, it must have been
very enriching

02:35.254 --> 02:36.888
to have a mother
who played the cello.

02:36.889 --> 02:37.939
Like hell.

02:37.940 --> 02:39.440
Her food tasted like rosin,

02:39.474 --> 02:42.710
and every time I tried to sit
on her lap, I fell through.

02:46.265 --> 02:48.182
Hey, Cliffie, how're you doing?

02:48.183 --> 02:49.084
Not well, Sam.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.268
Boy, am I mad!

02:51.704 --> 02:53.137
I've never been this upset!

02:53.172 --> 02:55.373
Boy, three words fellas,

02:55.374 --> 02:56.391
three words:

02:56.392 --> 02:58.459
Dames is grief.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.513
Fighting with Ma, huh?

03:01.547 --> 03:03.415
Oh, and how.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.982
It seems like that's
all we do anymore.

03:04.983 --> 03:06.951
You know, you'd think
it'd be a perfect set-up...

03:06.952 --> 03:08.086
mother and a grown son

03:08.087 --> 03:09.454
living in a one
bedroom apartment.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.755
But no.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.259
Reality check, gentlemen.

03:14.293 --> 03:16.403
Life is not like
the movies, I guess, huh?

03:17.796 --> 03:19.881
I'm sure it'll
all blow over, Cliffie.

03:19.882 --> 03:21.483
No, no way, Sammy,
not this time.

03:21.484 --> 03:23.285
I tell you that broad's
pushed me too hard.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.786
Too hard, I tell you.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.688
It's about time
I started pushing back.

03:26.689 --> 03:28.856
She's just gone and created
a monster, that's all.

03:28.857 --> 03:30.692
But this monster is not gonna

03:30.726 --> 03:32.527
lie in some tomb of ice.

03:32.561 --> 03:34.746
No, sirree.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.298
My anger will melt that ice,
so that I might rise up

03:37.299 --> 03:40.335
and, and crush the Tokyo
of the buildings there

03:40.369 --> 03:42.804
beneath the talons
of my animosity...

03:42.838 --> 03:44.639
Cliff, Cliff.

03:44.640 --> 03:46.374
We all appreciate
how hard you're working

03:46.375 --> 03:48.309
on this metaphor,
but we get the idea.

03:51.514 --> 03:54.749
(vocalizing Mahler's
"Symphony No. 3 in D Minor")

03:54.783 --> 03:57.619
What a majestic composer
that Mahler was.

03:57.653 --> 03:59.387
What a piece of work!

03:59.388 --> 04:01.022
I'll go upstairs
and see if Melville's

04:01.023 --> 04:03.290
is still serving dinner.
SAM: Say, Kelly,

04:03.325 --> 04:05.193
you go to a lot
of those classical...

04:05.227 --> 04:06.761
concert things, don't you?

04:06.795 --> 04:08.062
Do you really enjoy them?

04:08.096 --> 04:09.413
Oh, I love them, Sam.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.049
I just sit there
and let my mind

04:11.083 --> 04:13.818
become a total blank.

04:13.852 --> 04:15.786
How, how do you do that?

04:15.821 --> 04:17.872
How do I do what?

04:20.125 --> 04:22.093
You have a nice dinner, Kelly.

04:23.979 --> 04:26.329
Why don't you order
some protein, sweetheart.

04:27.399 --> 04:30.234
That opening piece,
that gorgeous

04:30.268 --> 04:33.270
Dvorjak cello
concerto in, uh...

04:33.305 --> 04:34.872
What was it?
B Minor.

04:34.907 --> 04:37.708
Yes, I thought that was...

04:37.743 --> 04:39.644
Why, Miss Howe.

04:39.678 --> 04:41.645
I'm flabbergasted.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.963
B Minor's correct.

04:42.998 --> 04:44.432
Believe me, I know.

04:44.466 --> 04:46.401
Well, my compliments.

04:46.402 --> 04:47.902
Obviously, when you've
worked at the house

04:47.903 --> 04:49.970
I've failed
to appreciate your depth.

04:50.005 --> 04:52.323
Not to mention her width.

04:55.360 --> 04:57.328
No, I've always thought

04:57.362 --> 05:00.031
that Mahler was
an acquired taste.

05:00.065 --> 05:02.100
You can say that again.

05:02.101 --> 05:04.018
You know, it was
a shared love for music

05:04.019 --> 05:06.287
which first attracted me
to my ex-wife.

05:07.606 --> 05:11.209
Really?

05:11.243 --> 05:13.628
Do you know
"Mahler's Fourth"? (gasps)

05:13.662 --> 05:17.915
It's only my fave, that's all.

05:17.949 --> 05:19.601
Hey, Woody, how'd it go, man?

05:19.602 --> 05:20.885
Oh, Sam, you're right.
Yeah?

05:20.886 --> 05:22.053
As soon as those lights dimmed,

05:22.054 --> 05:23.988
I was sound asleep.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.057
These things really
came in handy. Oh...

05:26.359 --> 05:31.730
Yeah, I tell you, these things
bailed me out quite a few times.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.698
Got me through a lot
of heart-to-heart

05:33.699 --> 05:35.633
pillow talk with Diane.

05:38.270 --> 05:41.105
That cello concerto,
it gets everyone!

05:41.106 --> 05:43.007
You know, I stole a look
at the young people

05:43.008 --> 05:44.926
during the allegretto,
and I must admit,

05:44.927 --> 05:48.413
even Woody was displaying
unusual intensity.

05:49.681 --> 05:51.315
KELLY:
Woody.

05:51.316 --> 05:52.750
Woody, they say
we can still eat

05:52.751 --> 05:54.752
if we order right now.

05:54.786 --> 05:56.421
You know, Miss Howe,

05:56.455 --> 05:58.389
I know this is late notice,

05:58.390 --> 06:00.157
but are you free
this Saturday night?

06:00.158 --> 06:02.660
I'm having some people in to
listen to classical music.

06:02.661 --> 06:03.961
This, this, this,
this Saturday?

06:03.962 --> 06:05.296
If you're busy,
I'll understand... No, no!

06:05.297 --> 06:07.098
I, I'm I-I-I'm available.

06:07.132 --> 06:08.933
Oh, splendid.

06:08.967 --> 06:10.435
Shall we say around 7:00?

06:10.469 --> 06:12.704
7:00.
Yeah.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.656
My God!

06:15.657 --> 06:17.659
Did you, did you
just hear what happened?

06:17.660 --> 06:19.160
I certainly did.

06:19.194 --> 06:22.363
This incredibly
rich man asked me out.

06:22.364 --> 06:23.931
And-and all this time,
he's just b...

06:23.932 --> 06:25.800
he's been there
right in front of my nose.

06:25.801 --> 06:27.935
Well, congratulations, honey.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.404
(whispers):
I think he loves me.

06:30.438 --> 06:32.656
Oh, come- slow down,
will you?

06:32.691 --> 06:35.459
Just slow down. All he did was
ask you for a date.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.211
Well, all Charles
did was ask Diana

06:37.212 --> 06:39.314
if she wanted a cup of tea.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.682
And look how that turned out.

06:40.683 --> 06:42.550
Their marriage is in shambles.

06:42.584 --> 06:43.701
"Shambles"?

06:43.735 --> 06:45.536
She got three castles
and $80 mil.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.071
I call that happily ever after.

06:49.808 --> 06:52.410
I forgot my purse.

06:52.444 --> 06:53.661
Uh, Kelly?

06:53.695 --> 06:56.530
Kelly, is your, is your dad
seeing anyone special?

06:56.565 --> 06:58.399
No, and I wish he were.

06:58.433 --> 06:59.500
Since the divorce,

06:59.534 --> 07:01.402
he just mopes around the house.

07:01.403 --> 07:03.338
I sure wish he'd meet
someone wonderful.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.523
Oh, so do I.

07:05.558 --> 07:07.691
For you, I mean.

07:07.726 --> 07:11.228
You know, Kelly,
isn't it rough on you,

07:11.263 --> 07:14.699
not having a mother around?

07:14.733 --> 07:17.836
I mean, you don't
even have a stepmother.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.070
Somebody to chat with,

07:20.105 --> 07:23.090
and to share things with,

07:23.125 --> 07:24.826
and to confide
and tell all your

07:24.860 --> 07:27.428
special little secrets to.

07:27.462 --> 07:29.046
Boy, I'll say.

07:29.047 --> 07:30.698
Like there's this
thing Woody does

07:30.699 --> 07:31.833
when we make love.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.467
Now tell me if you
think this is normal...

07:33.468 --> 07:35.019
Let's just save it.
Let-let...

07:35.020 --> 07:37.388
I think your soup's getting
cold. Come on, honey.

07:37.389 --> 07:39.156
Go on upstairs.
Bye-bye.

07:46.181 --> 07:48.216
Hey, Carla.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.467
Give me a quick coffee,
will you?

07:49.468 --> 07:51.018
I've got some major
driving to do.

07:51.019 --> 07:52.069
Cliffie.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.354
Where've you been
the past few days?

07:53.355 --> 07:54.572
Ah, getting my nerve up.

07:54.606 --> 07:56.140
For what?

07:56.174 --> 07:57.675
Something drastic.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.493
You and your mom
still fighting?

07:59.528 --> 08:01.095
No, that's, uh...

08:01.129 --> 08:03.731
not a problem anymore.

08:03.766 --> 08:06.100
No, uh, well why, Cliff?
Why not?

08:06.134 --> 08:08.252
Well, 'cause I had
all I could take.

08:08.286 --> 08:10.454
Something unpleasant
had to be done.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.924
And it wasn't pretty,
it wasn't easy, but, uh,

08:12.958 --> 08:14.692
she won't be bugging me anymore.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.831
So, what's been
going on around here?

08:23.017 --> 08:26.037
Well, Cliff, your ma is still
at your place, isn't she?

08:26.071 --> 08:29.190
No, she's, uh, out in the car.

08:30.626 --> 08:33.059
Why didn't you bring her in?

08:33.094 --> 08:36.748
Oh, everybody's getting kind
of nosy around here, huh?

08:36.782 --> 08:39.918
You think, uh, we'll talk about
something else, please?

08:39.952 --> 08:41.802
You love talking about your ma.

08:41.837 --> 08:44.272
Hey! Subject closed,
all right?

08:44.306 --> 08:46.206
Aw, forget it.

08:46.241 --> 08:49.011
Maybe there aren't so many
"Ma lovers" out in the woods.

08:52.748 --> 08:55.449
I knew this day would come.

08:55.484 --> 08:58.085
Clavin whacked his mother.

08:58.086 --> 08:59.087
Come on, Carla.

08:59.088 --> 09:00.888
He said she was
"out in the car."

09:00.922 --> 09:03.174
Yeah, and soon she'll be
out in the woods.

09:03.208 --> 09:06.393
Yeah, well, maybe she's getting
her own place, you know?

09:06.394 --> 09:08.496
Yeah, she's probably
getting a lot of places.

09:08.497 --> 09:11.064
Especially after
the bears dig her up.

09:11.099 --> 09:13.384
Oh, knock it off, Carla.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.319
Cliff didn't kill anybody.

09:15.353 --> 09:17.121
Why not?

09:17.155 --> 09:18.856
What do we really
know about him?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.292
We know he is weird.

09:21.326 --> 09:23.744
He's weird, but he's not
that weird.

09:23.745 --> 09:25.713
Look, to kill his mother,
he'd have to be some

09:25.714 --> 09:29.150
kind of slobbering, degenerate
dual-personality psychopath.

09:29.184 --> 09:32.086
Anybody got
a problem with that?

09:32.121 --> 09:33.938
I can't believe
I'm hearing this!

09:33.939 --> 09:36.373
If you really think Cliff is
capable of murdering his mother,

09:36.374 --> 09:38.409
why do you remain his friends?

09:38.443 --> 09:40.377
He's my ride.

09:51.190 --> 09:53.124
Well, here we are.

09:53.158 --> 09:55.759
Oh, Ma!
Look at this!

09:55.760 --> 09:57.979
Even better than the picture
in the brochure.

09:57.980 --> 10:00.681
Yes, I expect I'll be
perfectly delighted

10:00.716 --> 10:03.417
once I stop weeping
and feeling carsick.

10:03.418 --> 10:05.402
Aw, come on, Ma,
the ride wasn't that bad.

10:05.403 --> 10:06.737
You drive too fast.

10:06.771 --> 10:08.239
All young people do.

10:08.273 --> 10:09.606
I've often said,

10:09.641 --> 10:12.243
"A lot of needless
accidents could be avoided

10:12.344 --> 10:15.529
if they'd just raise
the legal driving age to 50."

10:16.715 --> 10:18.666
Well, I was just
in a hurry to get you

10:18.667 --> 10:20.635
to this beautiful
retirement community.

10:20.636 --> 10:23.604
I'll say.
Talk about luxury, huh?

10:23.639 --> 10:25.572
Oh! That bed, that's,

10:25.607 --> 10:27.441
that's practically
king-sized.

10:27.443 --> 10:30.544
King Richard III,
wasn't he the dwarf?

10:33.165 --> 10:35.199
Oh, what do we got here?

10:35.233 --> 10:37.234
Whoa, look at this, Ma!

10:37.269 --> 10:39.970
You've got a beautiful view
of the woods here.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.173
Boy, oh, boy- you know,
when I see a place

10:42.207 --> 10:44.725
like this, I...
I almost wish I was retired.

10:44.827 --> 10:49.280
Clifford, are you sure we can
afford a place like this?

10:49.281 --> 10:50.231
Oh, yeah, but don't worry,

10:50.232 --> 10:51.565
your insurance policies
will cover it.

10:51.566 --> 10:53.100
Oh, that's convenient.

10:53.135 --> 10:55.802
You'll have money left
for hooch and slatterns.

10:55.837 --> 10:57.704
Oh, come on, Ma.

10:57.705 --> 10:59.740
You know I'm just doing
what's best for you.

10:59.741 --> 11:01.842
(groans):
Come on, Ma.

11:01.876 --> 11:03.894
We've both got to be
strong about this.

11:07.015 --> 11:08.983
I suppose you're right.

11:08.984 --> 11:10.384
Well, you're darned
tootin', I'm right.

11:10.385 --> 11:12.953
I mean, you're gonna have
a lot of fun here, Ma.

11:12.954 --> 11:15.356
The brochure says the day's
crammed with activities.

11:15.357 --> 11:17.507
You'll play bingo
to your heart's content.

11:17.508 --> 11:19.676
You'll make new friends.

11:19.677 --> 11:20.861
These are your golden years.

11:20.862 --> 11:22.229
Oh, bless your heart.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.554
You've given me what
every mother dreams of...

11:24.566 --> 11:26.300
a tastefully furnished room

11:26.334 --> 11:28.369
in which to die
among strangers.

11:28.454 --> 11:29.636
Ma, come on.

11:29.637 --> 11:31.505
We're, we're gonna be
strong, remember?

11:31.506 --> 11:33.473
Now, is there
anything you need?

11:33.475 --> 11:35.025
Well...

11:35.060 --> 11:37.194
you could keep my garden up.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.964
I think there are
a couple of bags left

11:39.998 --> 11:41.832
of that steer manure
you gave me

11:41.867 --> 11:43.634
last Mothers' Day.

11:43.668 --> 11:46.303
Okay. I'll go do that now.

11:46.337 --> 11:48.272
Bye-bye.

11:49.340 --> 11:51.876
(crying)

11:51.910 --> 11:53.144
Ma, will you stop that?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.929
All right, good-bye.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.816
(sobbing)

11:58.851 --> 12:00.485
Ma!

12:00.519 --> 12:02.520
What? I'm just
standing here.

12:02.521 --> 12:03.905
You're making those noises.

12:03.906 --> 12:05.289
I don't hear any noises.

12:05.290 --> 12:06.741
It must be
your guilty conscience.

12:06.742 --> 12:08.109
You run along.

12:08.143 --> 12:10.044
I expect they'll
be here any minute

12:10.046 --> 12:11.712
to prep me for my lobotomy.

12:11.796 --> 12:16.000
Ma, you're not going
to make me feel guilty.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.184
Now, I'm gonna leave,

12:17.218 --> 12:19.504
and I'll see you
next visitors' day.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.155
Bring cigarettes.

12:21.223 --> 12:23.273
They're money
in these places, you know.

12:29.481 --> 12:31.382
Presto.

12:31.383 --> 12:33.935
Wow, that's a nifty gismo
for cracking locks, Carla.

12:33.936 --> 12:35.502
Where'd you get it?
My kid made it

12:35.503 --> 12:36.938
in Shop for Mothers' Day.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.040
I don't feel right,

12:40.041 --> 12:41.776
breaking into Cliff's place
like this.

12:41.777 --> 12:44.195
Yeah, well, we've got
to do it now while he's out driving.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.546
It's the only way
we're gonna find out

12:45.547 --> 12:46.948
what happened to his mother.

12:46.949 --> 12:49.051
Yeah, besides, it's kind
of exciting, isn't it?

12:49.052 --> 12:50.935
You know, I always used
to dream of being

12:50.936 --> 12:53.237
a sophisticated,
international jewel thief,

12:53.238 --> 12:56.273
leaping catlike
from balcony to balcony.

12:57.842 --> 13:01.645
We've got to see if we can find
any trace of that poor woman.

13:01.713 --> 13:04.114
Look at this place,
give me the creeps.

13:04.132 --> 13:06.801
Look, Paul, go see
what's in there, okay?

13:08.520 --> 13:09.687
Oh, it's just a head.

13:09.721 --> 13:10.921
(gasps):
Oh!

13:10.955 --> 13:12.089
NORM:
Oh, relax.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.540
It's another word
for "bathroom."

13:13.541 --> 13:14.976
It's an old navy term.

13:14.978 --> 13:16.760
You were in the navy?

13:16.778 --> 13:19.530
Mess cook,
that dream came true.

13:19.531 --> 13:22.282
Well, go snoop around in there.

13:22.283 --> 13:24.618
See if you can find any
intimate, feminine stuff.

13:24.619 --> 13:26.219
Aye-aye.

13:27.321 --> 13:28.956
There's a jar of bubble bath.

13:28.991 --> 13:30.757
Oh, no, that's Cliff's.

13:30.792 --> 13:33.194
Uh, he uses it because he
thinks it keeps dogs

13:33.228 --> 13:34.728
from biting him on his route.

13:36.248 --> 13:38.098
Biting him on his what?

13:41.503 --> 13:44.138
When he's out
delivering mail, doofus.

13:44.172 --> 13:46.457
Is there anything
else in there?

13:47.559 --> 13:49.993
Uh, just guy stuff:

13:50.028 --> 13:53.064
Soap, toothpaste,
uh, aftershave.

13:53.098 --> 13:55.699
You know what's
weird about this?

13:55.733 --> 13:57.868
This closet has
all Cliff's stuff,

13:57.869 --> 14:00.171
but not even a trace
of any of Ma Clavin's stuff.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.972
Yeah, well what
about this skirt?

14:01.990 --> 14:03.573
Oh, no, that's Cliff's.

14:03.608 --> 14:05.209
It's, uh, it's a kilt.

14:05.210 --> 14:07.044
He wore it to the
Postman's Ball, remember?

14:07.045 --> 14:09.213
"A Night in Glasgow"
was the theme.

14:10.332 --> 14:11.765
This is fiendish.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.767
It's like he's just eliminated

14:13.802 --> 14:15.035
all traces of her.

14:15.036 --> 14:16.704
It's as though
she never existed.

14:16.705 --> 14:18.840
You're right, it is beginning
to get suspicious.

14:18.841 --> 14:20.440
Hey, wait a minute.

14:20.475 --> 14:21.942
What's this?

14:21.943 --> 14:23.110
Oh, no-no-no,
that's the mail.

14:23.111 --> 14:24.381
Come on, that's private.

14:24.463 --> 14:25.579
Right, like Cliff's

14:25.613 --> 14:27.183
never read anyone else's mail.

14:28.983 --> 14:30.517
"Dear Mister Clavin,

14:30.552 --> 14:32.552
"I am forwarding you
all your mother's

14:32.587 --> 14:35.655
insurance policies
under separate cover."

14:36.975 --> 14:38.175
This is the smoking gun.

14:38.277 --> 14:40.293
Let's get out of here.

14:40.294 --> 14:41.795
Too late, he's
coming up the stairs.

14:41.796 --> 14:43.130
(hushed):
Get in the closet. Yeah, yeah.

14:43.131 --> 14:44.198
Go on, get in the closet.

14:44.199 --> 14:45.465
There's not enough
room in here!

14:45.466 --> 14:47.868
NORM:
Well, everybody take a deep breath.

14:47.902 --> 14:49.203
(all inhaling)

14:57.846 --> 15:00.881
Well, I hope you're
satisfied, Clavin.

15:06.621 --> 15:09.556
You've done it now-
the dirty deed.

15:12.127 --> 15:14.461
There's no going back.

15:14.495 --> 15:16.130
So long.

15:16.164 --> 15:17.898
Arrivederci.

15:17.932 --> 15:19.133
Sayonara.

15:20.451 --> 15:22.386
Yachsomache.

15:25.123 --> 15:27.424
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:27.458 --> 15:30.228
I can't just pretend and go on
like nothing's happened.

15:31.129 --> 15:33.998
Oh, I've got to talk
to somebody.

15:34.032 --> 15:36.266
Somebody who will
understand me.

15:36.301 --> 15:39.070
Somebody who won't condemn me.

15:40.638 --> 15:42.840
Ma, I'm going down to Cheers!

15:44.325 --> 15:46.026
Get me...

15:49.131 --> 15:51.064
(all exhaling)

15:55.203 --> 15:58.606
Well, it sounds pretty
bad for Ma Clavin.

15:58.640 --> 15:59.906
Let's get out of here.

15:59.907 --> 16:00.791
Wait, wait, wait.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.060
No one is going anywhere
until I find out

16:03.111 --> 16:04.778
who had their hands on my butt.

16:06.948 --> 16:08.182
Oh, that was me.

16:08.216 --> 16:09.716
I thought you had gum.

16:18.109 --> 16:19.710
How do I look?

16:19.711 --> 16:21.261
Wow! You're dressed
a little fancy, aren't you,

16:21.262 --> 16:23.914
to go over to some guy's house
and listen to some music?

16:23.915 --> 16:26.817
First of all, it is not a house.

16:26.851 --> 16:29.152
It is a stately mansion.

16:29.153 --> 16:30.721
And secondly, it is
not "some guy."

16:30.722 --> 16:34.124
It is Mr. Gaines,
the man I adore.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.676
"Adore?"

16:35.710 --> 16:37.478
Come on, what are you doing...

16:37.512 --> 16:40.047
You don't even know the
guy's first name, do you?

16:40.098 --> 16:41.248
It's Mister.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.252
And if I play my cards
right tonight,

16:45.287 --> 16:47.054
I might just become
Mrs. Mr. Gaines.

16:47.155 --> 16:50.140
Just think of it, Sam.

16:50.175 --> 16:53.810
Starting tonight I am no
longer the old Rebecca Howe.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.946
I am the new Rebecca Howe.

16:55.980 --> 16:57.548
This is going to
be the start...

16:57.582 --> 17:01.452
BOTH:
Of a whole new life for me.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.303
Have I said that before?

17:03.304 --> 17:04.623
Only about a thousand times.

17:04.624 --> 17:07.741
BOTH:
Well, this time it's different.

17:07.775 --> 17:09.276
Wow.
Wow.

17:11.194 --> 17:12.796
Honey, you're doing it again.

17:12.829 --> 17:14.931
You're going completely
overboard.

17:14.965 --> 17:17.000
You do this time and time again.

17:17.034 --> 17:19.670
And I just, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

17:21.906 --> 17:24.308
You're right.

17:24.309 --> 17:26.109
I'm rushing into
things again, aren't I?

17:26.111 --> 17:28.011
Yeah.

17:28.045 --> 17:31.147
Listen, listen, it-it's just
a simple date, right?

17:31.148 --> 17:32.649
You're going over
to a guy's house

17:32.650 --> 17:34.217
and you listen
to a little music.

17:34.218 --> 17:36.153
That's right, I'm just
listening to a little music.

17:36.154 --> 17:37.220
Yeah.

17:37.254 --> 17:39.422
And I do like
some classical music.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.892
I, I... maybe they'll play
Wagner. I like Wagner.

17:41.893 --> 17:43.227
What's that catchy little tune

17:43.228 --> 17:44.761
that he has that I like?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.097
Oh, I know.

17:47.131 --> 17:50.634
(hums "Wedding March")

17:50.669 --> 17:52.403
You're doing it...

17:56.174 --> 17:58.275
Sam, you busy?

17:58.310 --> 17:59.743
Who is it?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.078
It's Cliff.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.247
Then, yeah.

18:04.266 --> 18:06.033
Thanks, Sam.

18:09.003 --> 18:12.272
Hey, I, uh, I'm really
upset about something.

18:12.306 --> 18:14.340
I, just need your advice, pal.

18:14.359 --> 18:16.426
Cliff, Cliff.

18:16.461 --> 18:19.231
They, they make fun of you
because they love you, okay?

18:20.548 --> 18:23.817
Uh, thanks, Sam, but, uh, uh...

18:23.851 --> 18:26.203
that's not really
why I came in here.

18:26.237 --> 18:28.506
Oh. Then, why?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.608
Well, Sam, I want
to talk about Ma.

18:33.712 --> 18:35.546
We've been fighting
a lot lately,

18:35.580 --> 18:36.881
and, uh, we've decided

18:36.915 --> 18:39.116
(voice breaking):
That she should go live

18:39.150 --> 18:40.634
in a retirement community.

18:40.668 --> 18:44.170
(sobbing): And, aw, Sammy, I'm
the worst son in the world!

18:44.205 --> 18:47.440
Oh, man, hey, uh, listen,

18:47.475 --> 18:49.142
all-all, all families...

18:49.176 --> 18:51.544
Do me a favor, do you want
to sit on the desk?

18:53.831 --> 18:55.432
All right.

18:55.433 --> 18:57.000
Uh, all-all families go
through this, Cliffie.

18:57.001 --> 18:59.102
Uh, you know, I think you're
doing the right thing.

18:59.103 --> 19:01.738
Uh, uh, you know, you know,

19:01.739 --> 19:03.907
I'll bet she's going
to be real happy, right?

19:03.908 --> 19:05.375
I mean, you picked
a nice place.

19:05.376 --> 19:06.493
Oh, yeah.

19:06.527 --> 19:07.878
A real nice place.

19:07.912 --> 19:09.212
Famous, too.

19:09.247 --> 19:11.181
It was profiled on 60 Minutes.

19:13.585 --> 19:16.286
You know, a couple weeks later,

19:16.287 --> 19:18.038
they went back
and did a follow-up even.

19:18.039 --> 19:20.925
There you go, Cliff.
Yeah.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.927
Yeah, I guess you're right, Sam.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.928
I still feel a little
bit guilty, though.

19:24.929 --> 19:26.913
Yeah, well, uh, you know,
there's no need for that.

19:26.914 --> 19:28.749
I think you're doing
the right thing, pal.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.768
Hey, thanks, Sam.

19:30.769 --> 19:33.002
Listen, I'd appreciate it
if you didn't spread it around,

19:33.003 --> 19:34.771
you know, this little
talk we had here.

19:34.772 --> 19:37.241
I only told you because
we're best friends.

19:37.275 --> 19:39.509
Well, fair enough.

19:39.544 --> 19:42.614
You know, but maybe we shouldn't
spread that around, either.

19:44.565 --> 19:46.382
I'm with you, Sam.
All right.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.621
I'll, uh, be back
in a while there, Woody.

19:51.656 --> 19:54.625
Just remembered a job I have
to take care of at home.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.210
All right, Mr. Clavin.

19:56.244 --> 19:57.378
Hey, Cliff...

19:57.412 --> 19:59.263
(all gasping)

19:59.297 --> 20:03.017
Oh, it's, uh, nice
to see you guys, too. Yeah.

20:03.051 --> 20:04.802
So, uh, where,
where've you been?

20:04.836 --> 20:07.170
Oh, here, there...
everywhere, you know.

20:07.204 --> 20:09.306
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.

20:09.340 --> 20:12.443
Oh, yeah, save a beer
for me, will you?

20:12.477 --> 20:15.362
Hey, where's he going?
Well, he said he had a job

20:15.396 --> 20:17.064
to take care of at home.

20:17.098 --> 20:19.933
Yeah- a little digging
in the backyard, maybe.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.819
Getting rid
of the murder weapon.

20:21.853 --> 20:23.186
Come on, Carla.

20:23.187 --> 20:24.821
I can't believe you people
are still pursuing

20:24.822 --> 20:26.690
that paranoid fantasy
about Cliff.

20:26.724 --> 20:29.043
It's no fantasy, Frasier.

20:29.077 --> 20:30.337
And isn't it interesting

20:30.361 --> 20:33.163
that you're the one
who keeps defending him?

20:33.164 --> 20:34.998
Well, I'm not defending him.
I'm merely saying...

20:34.999 --> 20:37.668
Where is Lilith
these days, anyhow?

20:37.702 --> 20:41.805
Has anyone here heard
from Lilith lately?

20:41.839 --> 20:43.390
Oh, come on, Carla, lay off.

20:43.424 --> 20:46.060
And what about Vera, Norm?
Where is Vera?

20:46.094 --> 20:50.097
Carla...
And has anyone ever seen Paul's alleged ex?

20:50.131 --> 20:51.731
You're all sick.

20:51.765 --> 20:53.901
It's an evil conspiracy.

20:53.935 --> 20:55.653
A bunch of frustrated men

20:55.687 --> 20:56.987
who slaughter women

20:56.988 --> 20:59.456
and then chop up their bodies
in the dead of night!

20:59.457 --> 21:02.726
Oh, man!

21:02.761 --> 21:04.561
I'd better
have a date pretty soon

21:04.595 --> 21:06.429
or I'm gonna start
turning weird.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.120
(piano playing
gentle, classical melody)

21:13.154 --> 21:16.106
(singing in Italian)

21:25.249 --> 21:26.349
Why, Miss Howe

21:26.350 --> 21:28.051
I was just beginning
to worry about you.

21:28.052 --> 21:30.854
Oh, please, call me Rebecca.

21:30.888 --> 21:32.639
What a lovely home you have.

21:32.673 --> 21:35.775
So many possibilities.

21:35.809 --> 21:37.027
Why, thank you.

21:37.028 --> 21:38.795
You should enjoy yourself
this evening.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.347
We're having
an all-Mahler program.

21:40.348 --> 21:42.282
Oh, wonderful.

21:42.316 --> 21:45.185
Yes. I've hired
a very gifted German baritone.

21:45.219 --> 21:48.155
He'll be performing Mahler's
"Kindertotenleider,"

21:48.189 --> 21:50.124
songs on the death of children.

21:50.158 --> 21:53.476
Well, if we don't have fun
tonight, we never will.

21:53.477 --> 21:54.811
Yes, and you should be able

21:54.812 --> 21:56.280
to hear adequately
from your station,

21:56.281 --> 21:58.581
where you'll be
performing your duties.

21:58.616 --> 22:00.884
My station?

22:00.885 --> 22:03.069
Yes. You'll be tending bar
just through that door.

22:03.070 --> 22:05.338
You know, we didn't have
a chance to discuss your wages.

22:05.339 --> 22:06.606
Now I want to be fair.

22:06.640 --> 22:08.592
My station? My duties?

22:08.593 --> 22:09.826
Uh, Hives, here,
has your apron.

22:09.827 --> 22:12.312
Hives? He'll explain
your duties.

22:12.313 --> 22:13.764
I'll start off
with a white wine.

22:13.765 --> 22:17.017
My station? My duties?
My apron?

22:17.051 --> 22:18.902
Fancy dress.

22:18.936 --> 22:21.706
Hives, I-I think there's
been a terrible mistake here.

22:21.739 --> 22:23.807
You see, I-I think
I was supposed to be

22:23.841 --> 22:26.276
Mister Gaines' date
for this evening.

22:26.310 --> 22:30.013
Really! Oh, they'll love that
in the kitchen.

22:32.733 --> 22:33.967
Thank you.

22:34.002 --> 22:36.703
You're very kind.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.992
(sobbing)

22:51.936 --> 22:53.737
Oh, honey,
I'm sorry to hear that.

22:53.771 --> 22:56.790
I-I'll be over as soon as I can.

22:56.824 --> 22:58.208
Who was that?

22:58.242 --> 23:00.627
Aw, it's Rebecca.
She's all upset.

23:00.662 --> 23:03.463
Your father-in-law invited her
over to his place

23:03.497 --> 23:05.899
to, uh, listen
to a musicale tonight.

23:05.933 --> 23:08.601
She thought she was
supposed to be his date...

23:08.636 --> 23:10.436
got all dressed up
in a fancy dress.

23:10.471 --> 23:13.140
Turns out she's only there
to tend bar.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.476
How could she make that mistake?

23:15.477 --> 23:16.443
Oh, come on, Woody.

23:16.444 --> 23:17.911
Put yourself in her position.

23:17.945 --> 23:20.547
You know, attractive guy
asks you over to his place

23:20.548 --> 23:22.916
to listen to some music, wants
you to wear a fancy dress...

23:22.917 --> 23:24.151
you'd go, wouldn't you?

23:24.185 --> 23:25.318
Oh, no! No.

23:25.319 --> 23:27.654
My high school drama teacher
tried that one on me.

23:27.655 --> 23:30.323
Once bitten, twice shy,
my friend.

23:55.366 --> 23:57.267
Maybe I'm misreading this.

23:57.302 --> 24:00.537
Maybe this really is a date.

24:02.807 --> 24:06.142
No, it isn't!

24:07.578 --> 24:08.945
Two red wines.

24:08.980 --> 24:13.484
And do try to pour them evenly
this time.

24:13.518 --> 24:16.303
(imitating):
Do try to pour them evenly.

24:51.939 --> 24:53.774
(dogs snarling and barking)

24:59.230 --> 25:00.897
Oh sweetheart, sweetheart.

25:00.931 --> 25:03.166
Oh, I came as soon
as you called, honey.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.717
(sobbing) Oh, baby.

25:04.752 --> 25:07.254
I don't blame you
for being disappointed.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.605
I'm not disappointed!

25:08.640 --> 25:11.642
Well...
I'm humiliated.

25:11.676 --> 25:15.045
I thought- this is
what really hurts me...

25:15.079 --> 25:18.481
I thought he really liked me.

25:19.183 --> 25:22.152
Oh, Sam, you need
to... you need to...

25:22.153 --> 25:24.054
you need to stand in
for me tonight please.

25:24.055 --> 25:25.022
I'm too embarrassed.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.390
I can't go out there again.

25:26.391 --> 25:27.223
I know. I know.

25:27.224 --> 25:28.357
All right, I tell you what,

25:28.358 --> 25:31.111
uh, let me just...
collect some empties.

25:31.145 --> 25:32.762
Here we go.

25:32.796 --> 25:34.864
I'll take over
as soon as I get back.

25:34.899 --> 25:36.299
All right?
Thank you.

25:43.190 --> 25:45.008
You're kidding, Sam.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.143
Miss Howe thought
this was to be a date?

25:47.144 --> 25:48.178
Yes, sir.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.146
And, uh, to tell you
the truth, sir,

25:50.181 --> 25:53.000
I heard what you said and I...
and I thought the same thing.

25:53.034 --> 25:56.319
You did? My Lord.

25:56.353 --> 25:59.355
Although- and I don't mean
this in any way personally

25:59.390 --> 26:00.770
you'll have to admit you are

26:00.792 --> 26:03.393
far from the brightest person
in the world.

26:03.427 --> 26:05.912
True. That's-that's-that's
very true, sir.

26:05.946 --> 26:09.716
Um, you know, Rebecca's
been looking forward

26:09.750 --> 26:11.718
to this evening the whole week.

26:11.752 --> 26:15.188
And, between you and me, sir,
she finds you very attractive

26:15.222 --> 26:18.758
and I think she thought
the feeling was mutual.

26:18.759 --> 26:20.026
Miss Howe is attracted to me?

26:20.027 --> 26:21.745
I had no idea.

26:21.779 --> 26:25.949
You see, son, I am not exactly
what you'd call a ladies' man.

26:25.983 --> 26:29.118
Well, if you don't mind, sir,
uh...

26:29.153 --> 26:32.155
have you ever considered
that it might be your hair?

26:33.938 --> 26:38.928
Sam, why don't you go in the bar
and relieve Rebecca.

26:38.929 --> 26:40.363
Send her out here, and I'll, uh,

26:40.364 --> 26:42.549
try to make it up to her
by having her as my guest.

26:42.550 --> 26:43.733
Oh, thank you, sir.

26:43.734 --> 26:45.001
That's... I think that's
the right thing to do.

26:45.002 --> 26:46.503
We'll talk later...
Yes.

26:50.875 --> 26:54.544
Okay. Everybody
stand up straight.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.246
Wh-what are
you doing?

26:57.247 --> 26:59.850
Well, I'm taking
some of the wine out of these bottles

26:59.851 --> 27:02.561
so that when I pour them
in the glasses they'll be even.

27:05.189 --> 27:06.856
How much have you had to drink?

27:06.890 --> 27:09.459
In my life or tonight?

27:09.493 --> 27:11.211
Tonight.

27:11.212 --> 27:12.462
Well, that's hard to say,

27:12.463 --> 27:16.199
because I've been drinking.

27:17.151 --> 27:19.719
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

27:19.753 --> 27:21.088
Oh, boy, oh, boy what?

27:21.089 --> 27:23.823
Mister Gaines just realized
his mistake and he wants,

27:23.824 --> 27:26.459
he wants you to be his date
for the rest of the evening.

27:26.460 --> 27:28.144
He does?

27:28.179 --> 27:30.413
Oh, he loves me again!

27:33.484 --> 27:35.652
Oh, my ship has come in.

27:35.686 --> 27:37.387
Not yet. Not yet it hasn't.

27:37.388 --> 27:39.389
We-we're gonna have
to sober you up, sweetheart.

27:39.390 --> 27:40.857
Okay, then give me a Tic Tac.

27:40.891 --> 27:45.862
No, no, we're, uh,
we're way beyond Tic Tacs.

27:45.896 --> 27:47.196
Oh, we are?
Yeah.

27:47.197 --> 27:48.698
Okay. Oh, God! Oh, no.
Oh, you know what?

27:48.699 --> 27:50.066
You're gonna have
to help me here

27:50.067 --> 27:52.268
because I can't let Mister
Gaines see me like this

27:52.269 --> 27:54.036
because he's gonna
think I'm drunk.

27:54.037 --> 27:55.705
Yeah. Uh...
Now you have been drunk before.

27:55.706 --> 27:58.374
So what did you used to do when
you used to try and get sober?

27:58.375 --> 28:00.710
Well, I had, uh...
yeah, actually I did.

28:00.744 --> 28:04.647
I had this little trick and it-
it kind of hurts, but it works.

28:07.585 --> 28:09.485
Okay. What is it?

28:13.991 --> 28:15.659
Honey, uh, I te...

28:15.693 --> 28:17.383
I've got to get
some coffee in you.

28:18.562 --> 28:20.113
I'll be right there.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.187
Well, Norm?

28:27.188 --> 28:28.454
Well, nothing.

28:28.455 --> 28:30.623
I just keep getting
Cliff's answering machine.

28:30.624 --> 28:32.125
No word of his ma

28:32.126 --> 28:33.777
or any forwarding
address or anything.

28:33.778 --> 28:35.428
Well, that's weird.

28:36.964 --> 28:40.283
You know what's weirder
is-is the outgoing message.

28:40.317 --> 28:42.552
You know for years how
it was Cliff and his ma

28:42.586 --> 28:44.156
singing "Come
On'a My House?"

28:45.305 --> 28:47.874
Well, now it's just Cliff.

28:47.909 --> 28:50.043
And I gotta tell you,
I miss that harmony.

28:51.362 --> 28:52.745
Come on, you guys...

28:52.780 --> 28:55.732
you can't really believe
that Cliff killed his mother.

28:55.766 --> 28:58.518
Hey, everybody.

29:05.492 --> 29:07.661
What's in the,
uh, sacks, Cliff?

29:07.695 --> 29:10.630
Oh, just some old things
of Ma's, getting rid of them.

29:10.664 --> 29:15.836
I just can't stand to have them
around the house anymore.

29:15.870 --> 29:23.059
Cliff, uh, you've been acting,
oh, a little strange lately.

29:23.093 --> 29:25.462
Is there- is there
anything on your mind

29:25.496 --> 29:27.296
that you'd like to, uh, just...

29:27.331 --> 29:31.167
Say is that- is that dirt
underneath your nails?

29:31.201 --> 29:37.139
Yeah. I've been spending a lot
of time in the garden lately.

29:39.493 --> 29:41.478
Can't get my hands clean.

29:41.512 --> 29:44.964
I-I wash them and wash them.

29:44.999 --> 29:49.702
Yes, but, uh, Cliff,
is-is there a-anything

29:49.736 --> 29:53.339
on-on your mind y-you'd
like to talk to me about?

29:53.374 --> 29:54.941
I don't want to talk, Doc.

29:54.975 --> 29:57.510
Uh, I want to watch television.

29:57.544 --> 30:00.546
See if there's anything
on the news.

30:04.668 --> 30:07.003
Dare you to look inside.

30:07.037 --> 30:09.405
Dare you.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.924
Somebody's got to look.

30:10.958 --> 30:12.008
Not me.

30:12.009 --> 30:15.211
I've seen enough body parts
to choke a horse.

30:15.245 --> 30:16.680
Literally, in one case.

30:21.268 --> 30:24.170
(piano playing classical music)

30:31.429 --> 30:32.862
Ah, Miss Howe.

30:32.896 --> 30:35.081
I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding.

30:35.115 --> 30:37.300
No misunderstanding taken.

30:37.301 --> 30:41.404
Uh, everyone, may I have
your attention please? (music stops)

30:41.405 --> 30:43.323
I'd like to introduce my
date for this evening,

30:43.324 --> 30:44.674
Miss Rebecca Howe.

30:44.708 --> 30:46.493
Hello.

30:46.527 --> 30:48.161
Good evening.

30:48.195 --> 30:50.130
Thank you for dropping by.

30:50.164 --> 30:52.098
GAINES:
You're looking very lovely

30:52.132 --> 30:53.383
this evening, Rebecca.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.018
And so are you, Mister.

31:02.993 --> 31:04.361
Well,

31:04.395 --> 31:07.163
shall we begin our
Kindergarten Teeter Tooter?

31:09.766 --> 31:10.933
Delightful.

31:12.820 --> 31:14.500
(piano playing classical music)

31:20.995 --> 31:22.929
(baritone begins singing)

31:41.215 --> 31:43.149
(humming along
off-key)

31:46.520 --> 31:48.621
(humming along
off-key)

31:48.655 --> 31:51.291
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

31:51.325 --> 31:53.259
(mouths):
I'm sorry.

32:03.737 --> 32:06.039
(singing along in
foreign language)

32:07.777 --> 32:09.659
(music stops)

32:09.660 --> 32:10.660
Look, look, I'm sorry.

32:10.661 --> 32:12.128
I cannot concentrate!

32:12.162 --> 32:13.730
I can't either!

32:13.764 --> 32:16.766
Now, listen, let me just
tell you people one thing.

32:16.800 --> 32:21.021
Raymond Burr came a long way
to entertain us.

32:21.055 --> 32:23.223
And I think

32:23.257 --> 32:26.776
out of courtesy to him,
we should keep our mouths shut!

32:26.810 --> 32:29.162
Miss Howe, you are
obviously inebriated.

32:29.163 --> 32:30.196
Now, you're
embarrassing yourself,

32:30.197 --> 32:31.230
you're embarrassing me.

32:31.231 --> 32:32.932
I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

32:32.933 --> 32:33.933
(whispers):
Oh, no, no, no.

32:33.934 --> 32:35.018
Please, don't do that.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.404
This means so much to me.

32:37.405 --> 32:39.506
Please, I don't know,
I've heard this a million times,

32:39.507 --> 32:41.140
and I don't know,
it's just so catchy.

32:41.141 --> 32:43.109
I never noticed before.

32:43.143 --> 32:45.344
Please, please,
just-just let me stay.

32:45.379 --> 32:48.269
I-I promise, if you let me stay,
I won't sing one more note.

32:51.519 --> 32:53.819
Very well.

32:55.706 --> 32:58.541
(piano playing classical music)

33:00.627 --> 33:02.737
(man singing opera
in foreign language)

33:09.386 --> 33:10.586
(man hits high note)

33:10.620 --> 33:13.273
(sings off-key high note)

33:13.307 --> 33:15.624
I'll tell you Carla,
Rebecca's doing great.

33:15.625 --> 33:17.160
Yeah, I was
a little worried, too.

33:17.161 --> 33:19.031
But you know,
she's fitting right in.

33:19.032 --> 33:20.930
You know, I-I would
not be surprised

33:20.931 --> 33:23.083
if you heard wedding bells.

33:23.117 --> 33:24.383
Do me a favour, will you?

33:24.418 --> 33:27.119
Uh, you got to cover me for
a while at the bar, you know.

33:27.120 --> 33:29.121
No, no-no, there's-there's
no way you could,

33:29.122 --> 33:30.623
you could drag Rebecca
out of here.

33:30.624 --> 33:31.758
(clattering)

33:31.792 --> 33:34.461
Oh, hey, fellas.

33:34.495 --> 33:35.962
Hold on a second.

33:35.996 --> 33:37.046
How you doing?

33:37.047 --> 33:38.565
(dogs barking outside)

33:38.599 --> 33:40.867
The-the whole point is that...

33:40.901 --> 33:42.201
See, uh, the whole...

33:42.235 --> 33:43.386
Hold-hold on. I...

33:43.420 --> 33:46.605
The dogs are making
a racket here.

33:46.640 --> 33:49.575
You know, boy, they're really
chasing someone out there.

33:52.146 --> 33:55.281
You know, from here, from here,
it almost looks like...

33:55.315 --> 33:56.548
Oh.

33:56.583 --> 33:57.633
Oh, my God.

34:05.486 --> 34:09.411
REPORTER:
...witness news, including the latest

34:09.413 --> 34:11.283
sports and weather
right after this.

34:11.315 --> 34:14.033
Cliff, listen,
just one more time.

34:14.034 --> 34:15.668
Are you sure there's
not something

34:15.668 --> 34:17.503
you'd like to get
off your chest?

34:20.940 --> 34:23.208
Oh, all right, Doc.
I might as well tell you.

34:23.243 --> 34:25.795
Yeah.

34:25.829 --> 34:29.699
I sent Ma off to
a retirement community.

34:29.733 --> 34:31.384
A retirement community.

34:31.418 --> 34:33.219
CLIFF:
Yeah, yeah.

34:33.253 --> 34:35.254
One hell of a son, huh?

34:35.288 --> 34:37.056
Boy, I don't know why I did it.

34:37.090 --> 34:39.491
You know...

34:39.492 --> 34:42.094
I think I'm gonna go down there
today and bring her back home.

34:42.094 --> 34:43.462
I mean, that's
if she'll have me.

34:43.463 --> 34:44.964
Good for you, Cliff.

34:44.998 --> 34:47.851
Retirement home-
I, I knew it.

34:47.851 --> 34:49.652
And you guys thought
he killed his mother!

34:49.652 --> 34:50.886
(laughs)

34:50.920 --> 34:52.105
Thought what?

34:52.139 --> 34:53.839
Nothing.

34:53.873 --> 34:54.924
What?

34:54.942 --> 34:56.275
Ah!

34:56.310 --> 34:58.611
Well, I guess we
ought to tell him.

34:58.612 --> 34:59.645
Yeah.

34:59.646 --> 35:01.247
Uh, Cliffie, uh,

35:01.248 --> 35:02.815
you're gonna get a kick
out of this, actually.

35:02.816 --> 35:04.017
(Paul, Carla, Norm laughing)

35:04.018 --> 35:05.234
See,

35:05.268 --> 35:06.852
what we thought was that...

35:06.886 --> 35:09.322
Oh, hell, what's the best way
to put this, guys?

35:09.323 --> 35:11.907
We thought you killed your mom
and cut her up in little pieces.

35:11.908 --> 35:12.975
Beer?

35:14.945 --> 35:16.913
Boy, this is terrific.

35:16.947 --> 35:18.817
And you're supposed
to be my friends.

35:18.818 --> 35:20.749
How could you think
of something like that?

35:20.750 --> 35:21.834
Come on, Cliff.

35:21.835 --> 35:23.118
Yeah, we're sorry, Mr. Clavin.

35:23.119 --> 35:25.338
Ah, no, I mean,
that's a real rotten thing!

35:25.339 --> 35:26.706
Oh, Cliff, in the
bottom of our hearts,

35:26.707 --> 35:28.674
none of us really thought you
actually killed your mother.

35:28.675 --> 35:29.875
No! Golly!
(all chuckling)

35:29.876 --> 35:31.561
NORM:
Come on, I mean, you know,

35:31.562 --> 35:32.678
how could we think that?

35:32.679 --> 35:33.829
You're our buddy.
Yeah.

35:33.847 --> 35:35.681
Come on, we love
you, Cliffie, huh?

35:35.715 --> 35:37.283
Huh?
(all chuckling)

35:37.284 --> 35:38.517
REPORTER:
This just in.

35:38.518 --> 35:41.421
Gardeners have just discovered
human remains

35:41.422 --> 35:42.788
in the middle
of Lexington Common.

35:42.789 --> 35:43.856
Get him!

35:43.890 --> 35:45.741
(all grunting)

35:45.742 --> 35:48.461
Authorities believe the remains
may be those of a minute-man

35:48.462 --> 35:50.979
who fought in
the Revolutionary War.

35:51.014 --> 35:52.081
Ah!
Hey, Cliffie.

35:52.115 --> 35:53.516
(all chuckling) Come on.

35:53.550 --> 35:56.652
That's just a sample of how
much we love you, Cliffie.

36:03.227 --> 36:05.094
Uh, excuse me.

36:05.095 --> 36:07.196
My name's Clavin, and I,
uh, brought my mother

36:07.197 --> 36:08.264
in here earlier today.

36:08.265 --> 36:10.549
And now you're having
pangs of remorse.

36:10.550 --> 36:12.251
(chuckles):
Yeah. How'd you know?

36:12.252 --> 36:14.670
It's a common reaction.

36:14.705 --> 36:15.972
It's quite normal.

36:15.973 --> 36:16.905
Yeah, yeah.

36:16.906 --> 36:19.024
Well, uh,
I-I guess I'll be, uh,

36:19.059 --> 36:20.276
taking my ma home now.

36:20.310 --> 36:21.611
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:21.645 --> 36:24.213
I-I just went over
to her, uh, room there,

36:24.214 --> 36:25.431
and-and she wasn't around so...

36:25.432 --> 36:27.366
She's in the Starlight Lounge.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.784
There's a dance tonight.

36:28.818 --> 36:30.620
(waltz music playing faintly)

36:34.891 --> 36:36.826
(waltz music playing)

36:38.895 --> 36:40.630
Wow!

36:40.664 --> 36:43.966
I don't remember
the last time I saw Ma dancing.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.086
People often seem to come
out of their shells here.

36:47.120 --> 36:48.170
Hey, look at that.

36:48.188 --> 36:49.489
Guy just cut in on her.

36:49.523 --> 36:52.308
That silver-haired fox.

36:52.342 --> 36:53.392
(chuckles):
Yes.

36:53.410 --> 36:56.062
I was watching your mother
in the hot tub earlier.

36:56.096 --> 36:59.765
She seemed to be quite popular
with the gentlemen.

36:59.799 --> 37:02.518
You, uh, you have a hot tub?

37:02.552 --> 37:05.655
Oh, yes. Our residents
find it quite invigorating.

37:05.689 --> 37:07.323
After the softball tournament.

37:07.324 --> 37:08.224
Softball tournament.

37:08.225 --> 37:09.608
In fact,

37:09.642 --> 37:13.529
this afternoon, your mother
was chosen most valuable player.

37:13.563 --> 37:16.782
She went four for four at bat.

37:16.783 --> 37:18.768
But I think it was
the hook slide into third

37:18.769 --> 37:20.202
that really won their hearts.

37:20.203 --> 37:23.539
My mother's never played
softball in her life.

37:23.540 --> 37:25.457
(music stops, applause)
Maybe she never had the chance.

37:25.458 --> 37:27.310
(tango music playing)

37:30.332 --> 37:32.415
Oh.

37:32.416 --> 37:33.665
(chuckles):
Come here, come here.

37:33.666 --> 37:35.368
Look at this, look at this.

37:35.436 --> 37:38.003
She's doing a tango.

37:38.004 --> 37:40.005
She's got a rose in her
teeth and everything.

37:40.006 --> 37:41.073
(laughs)

37:41.074 --> 37:43.075
I just hope she doesn't
fall off that table.

37:43.076 --> 37:44.576
Ah, it's okay.

37:44.577 --> 37:47.113
She got eight guys waiting
there to catch her if she does.

37:47.114 --> 37:48.347
(laughs)

37:48.382 --> 37:50.900
Oh, boy, I've never
seen her so happy.

37:50.934 --> 37:52.968
I, uh...

37:53.002 --> 37:54.136
(chuckles)

37:54.170 --> 37:56.472
Got to say, I-I feel
kind of foolish.

37:56.506 --> 37:57.573
Don't.

37:57.574 --> 37:59.775
You just wanted what was
best for your mother.

37:59.776 --> 38:00.709
Yeah.

38:00.710 --> 38:02.478
Well, I always thought
that her world

38:02.479 --> 38:03.946
revolved around
her son, you know,

38:03.947 --> 38:06.149
that she couldn't, uh, ever
get along without me, so...

38:06.150 --> 38:08.200
Perhaps that's what
you wanted to think.

38:10.254 --> 38:11.654
Yeah.

38:11.688 --> 38:14.557
Now I can see she's happier
than she's ever been.

38:14.591 --> 38:16.075
(chuckles)

38:16.109 --> 38:17.776
Say, uh, I'd appreciate it

38:17.811 --> 38:20.012
if you didn't mention
that I was here.

38:20.046 --> 38:21.430
I understand.

38:21.464 --> 38:23.899
I guess I won't be
taking her home after all.

38:23.933 --> 38:25.050
I thought not.

38:25.084 --> 38:26.218
Yeah.

38:26.252 --> 38:28.821
Yeah, I'm just gonna
go have another peek.

38:28.855 --> 38:30.156
Oh, and-and, Mr. Clavin,

38:30.157 --> 38:32.024
while you're here,
your mother's insurance

38:32.025 --> 38:33.843
doesn't entirely cover
her expenses.

38:33.844 --> 38:34.894
(chuckles)

38:34.928 --> 38:35.978
I assume that, uh,

38:35.979 --> 38:37.729
you'll want to take care
of the remainder?

38:37.730 --> 38:38.730
Yeah, yeah, sure thing.

38:38.731 --> 38:39.932
Just send me the bill.

38:39.967 --> 38:42.501
Well, here's what it comes to
for the first year.

38:42.502 --> 38:44.270
Honestly, the cost
of running this place

38:44.271 --> 38:46.889
just keeps going up and up.

38:46.890 --> 38:49.275
Well, you can't put a price
on a mother's happiness.

38:49.276 --> 38:51.210
(chuckles)

39:01.504 --> 39:03.014
(screaming):
Oh, Clifford!

39:03.015 --> 39:04.022
Put me down!

39:04.023 --> 39:05.113
What are you doing?!

39:05.125 --> 39:07.235
I'm getting you
out of this hell hole, Ma!

39:10.930 --> 39:12.565
Here you go.

39:12.599 --> 39:14.533
Thank you, Sam.

39:17.237 --> 39:18.371
Feeling better?

39:18.405 --> 39:20.606
(sighs)

39:20.640 --> 39:23.325
I have never been
so humiliated in my life.

39:23.359 --> 39:26.295
I can't believe I did that.

39:26.329 --> 39:27.764
Do you know what I am?

39:27.798 --> 39:29.431
I'm a phony.

39:29.466 --> 39:32.201
I'm a great big phony.

39:32.236 --> 39:34.170
Pretending like I liked Mahler

39:34.204 --> 39:36.839
just so some rich guy
would ask me out.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.374
I don't even
know his first name.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.592
WOODY:
Gustav.

39:39.626 --> 39:41.310
Gustav Mahler.

39:45.548 --> 39:47.316
(sighs)

39:47.351 --> 39:50.853
Do you know that I don't
really even like Mr. Gaines?

39:50.887 --> 39:53.789
And yet I allowed myself
to just fall all over him

39:53.824 --> 39:55.441
just because he's rich.

39:55.475 --> 39:58.511
As God as my witness, Sam,

39:58.545 --> 40:02.548
I am never, ever
going af-after

40:02.583 --> 40:04.534
another rich man
as long as I live.

40:05.985 --> 40:07.919
Well, as far as
I can see, Normie,

40:07.954 --> 40:09.755
we're-we're sitting pretty.

40:09.789 --> 40:13.292
I mean, I don't, I don't
foresee any problems unless...

40:13.326 --> 40:16.262
well, unless of course there's
a second wave of Martians.

40:18.498 --> 40:21.032
Then, uh, then, my friend,
I think we've got

40:21.067 --> 40:23.869
some pretty serious
defence problems.

40:23.903 --> 40:27.105
But, oh, uh, heck, I'll go
into that some other time.

40:31.094 --> 40:33.962
(yawning):
Want a refill, Norm?

40:33.997 --> 40:35.231
Norm.

40:35.265 --> 40:36.432
Hey, Norm.

40:45.825 --> 40:46.958
Oh.

40:46.993 --> 40:48.894
There you are, Miss Howe.

40:48.928 --> 40:51.096
Uh, Mr. Gaines,

40:51.130 --> 40:52.531
I have to apologize.

40:52.565 --> 40:54.566
No, don't say a thing.

40:54.601 --> 40:58.036
I admit, I was upset by what
happened earlier this evening.

40:58.070 --> 41:01.139
But after I cooled down,
I realized it was all my fault.

41:01.140 --> 41:02.541
I was unclear
about my intentions.

41:02.542 --> 41:04.176
Now I'd like to
make it up to you.

41:04.177 --> 41:06.512
I thought we could have dinner
sometime, together,

41:06.513 --> 41:07.763
just the two of us.

41:07.797 --> 41:11.233
Just you and me?

41:11.267 --> 41:12.735
Yes.

41:12.769 --> 41:15.899
I'd be delighted to have dinner
with such an attractive woman.

41:25.966 --> 41:28.934
Sorry, Mr. Gaines.

41:28.969 --> 41:32.905
Um, I'm very flattered,
but I have to tell you

41:32.906 --> 41:35.140
that the only reason
I would have dinner with you

41:35.141 --> 41:38.544
is because you're so rich.

41:38.545 --> 41:40.045
And that wouldn't be
fair to you,

41:40.046 --> 41:41.513
and it wouldn't be fair to me.

41:41.547 --> 41:43.882
I see.

41:46.135 --> 41:48.620
Very well, Miss Howe.

41:48.655 --> 41:49.722
Good-bye.

41:49.756 --> 41:52.407
Good-bye.

41:57.313 --> 41:59.915
Well, Rebecca,
I must say I'm impressed.

41:59.916 --> 42:02.017
This could be a big
turning point in your life.

42:02.018 --> 42:04.519
At last, your actions
fit your words.

42:04.520 --> 42:05.554
Yeah, I'm with Frasier.

42:05.555 --> 42:07.556
I'm really proud of you,
sweetheart.

42:07.590 --> 42:09.691
Thank you, I appreciate it.

42:09.726 --> 42:11.861
Sam, can you come here
and do me a favour?

42:11.895 --> 42:13.763
Sure, hon. What?

42:13.797 --> 42:16.232
Can you stop me from
going after him?

42:16.266 --> 42:18.367
I'm having a hard time
stopping myself.

42:18.401 --> 42:19.468
(chuckles)

42:19.502 --> 42:20.569
Whoa.

42:20.570 --> 42:22.204
And you're gonna need
Cliff and Norm.

42:22.205 --> 42:24.423
SAM:
Uh, Norm, Norm?

42:25.341 --> 42:28.644
Fras, you want to help me here?

42:28.678 --> 42:31.580
Mister. Mister!

42:31.614 --> 42:32.898
I'm coming, Mister!

42:32.932 --> 42:34.316
Mister!

42:34.350 --> 42:36.001
Mister!

42:37.305 --> 42:43.420
