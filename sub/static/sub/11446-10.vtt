WEBVTT

00:02.169 --> 00:03.204
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.337 --> 00:04.452
We will unite the clans

00:04.546 --> 00:06.662
and I will lead you all to glory.

00:06.757 --> 00:10.045
Charles has landed in Scotland
and is gathering his army.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.463
Then what will ye do, brother?

00:11.553 --> 00:14.341
<i>To save our clans, our country,</i>

00:14.431 --> 00:15.921
<i>we must band together.</i>

00:16.350 --> 00:18.341
Angus! Rupert.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.264
Dougal! Colum change his mind then?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.562
Colum's mind is his own. We are here.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.022
<i>We'll make a fine group
of Highland soldiers.</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:27.938
<i>It is our time.</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:31.020
These are my men, my clan.
They'll answer to me and no one else.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.946
If you choose to fight
with Clan Fraser,

00:33.033 --> 00:35.570
then you'll follow my orders
without objection.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.318
I would give my life

00:37.412 --> 00:39.653
to see a Stuart back on the throne.

00:39.748 --> 00:42.490
If we have the discipline
to fight together,

00:42.584 --> 00:44.951
then by God, we will win.

02:33.820 --> 02:36.812
<i>How many men
had I seen killed in war?</i>

02:37.908 --> 02:41.651
<i>This Highlander
who had run afoul of a Redcoat patrol</i>

02:41.745 --> 02:43.702
<i>was only the latest one.</i>

02:44.873 --> 02:48.036
<i>The rebellion Jamie and I
had laboured so hard to prevent</i>

02:48.126 --> 02:49.491
<i>was upon us.</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:55.164
<i>Our only hope was that somehow
we could change the outcome.</i>

02:57.260 --> 03:00.798
<i>I feared in my heart
that history would not be rewritten.</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:05.095
<i>That no matter
how many battles we might win,</i>

03:06.186 --> 03:08.848
<i>victory would remain
forever out of reach.</i>

03:08.939 --> 03:11.647
Claire, how long do you need
to take a simple piss?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.851
I'll be right there.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.233
<i>How many men
had I seen killed in war?</i>

03:26.832 --> 03:29.244
<i>Far, far too many.</i>

03:35.966 --> 03:38.003
There, sir.
Right there is your enemy.

03:38.468 --> 03:40.800
Yet we do nothing but sit here
and twiddle our thumbs.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.629
And what would you have
the Lord General do, John?

03:44.307 --> 03:46.799
Pardon me, Quartermaster O'Sullivan.

03:47.102 --> 03:48.263
Well, attack, damn it.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.013
Pardon me, Your Highness,
but for the life of me,

03:52.107 --> 03:54.144
I cannot understand
why General Murray insists

03:54.234 --> 03:56.225
we waste our time in dilly-dally.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.559
I rushed the army here

03:57.654 --> 03:59.691
to ensure our possession
of the high ground.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.149
And now you wish us to abandon
such a strong defensive position

04:03.243 --> 04:05.200
and attack the enemy in force?

04:05.287 --> 04:06.322
Indeed I do, sir.

04:07.247 --> 04:10.205
Time, sir. Time is of the essence.

04:10.375 --> 04:15.620
We must not tarry, Your Majesty.
We must strike and strike hard.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.081
May I remind the Quartermaster

04:18.175 --> 04:21.418
any attacking force
will have to cross here,

04:21.970 --> 04:23.881
through Tranent Meadows.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.804
Though "meadow" is a fancy name

04:25.891 --> 04:28.553
for the bog that lies
between us and the enemy.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.679
Since when did a Scotsman
shy away from a bit of mud?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.185
Especially when there's an enemy
waiting for him on the other side.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.233
Since when does an Irish-born officer
dismiss the dangers

04:38.320 --> 04:39.902
of boggy ground
to an infantry attack?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.400
Well, thank God.
A sane voice, at last.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.939
Can you imagine, sire?

04:44.409 --> 04:47.743
Your army wallowing helplessly
while under a withering volley

04:47.829 --> 04:49.661
from the British Brown Bess musket?

04:49.748 --> 04:53.036
A weapon deadly at 50 yards
and accurate up to 100.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.163
Cavalry could prove useful
to our needs.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.878
Both to test the ground
and to report on the enemy position.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.875
Aye, a braw squad of dragoons

04:59.966 --> 05:02.333
could mean the difference
between victory and defeat.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.294
Let us not speak of defeat
or of cavalry we do not have.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.177
And as for the Lord General,
may I remind him

05:09.267 --> 05:11.349
that he will be remaining
behind the lines,

05:11.436 --> 05:14.269
and therefore need not be concerned
about British marksmanship.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.393
Damn my liver!
What are you implying, sir?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.939
I imply nothing, sir.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.642
I'm merely grateful
that we are dependent

05:19.736 --> 05:21.192
upon the bravery of our warriors...

05:21.279 --> 05:22.360
Hear, hear!

05:22.447 --> 05:24.484
...who are not afraid
to face shot or shell

05:24.574 --> 05:27.282
to pursue a glorious victory
for our prince

05:27.369 --> 05:28.404
and for our king.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.735
Mark me,

05:30.914 --> 05:32.746
now it is but weeks gone

05:32.833 --> 05:34.915
since we took the cities
of Perth and Edinburgh

05:35.001 --> 05:36.742
without firing a single shot.

05:39.339 --> 05:44.960
And let us not forget,
they welcomed me with open arms.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.465
Aye, but on both occasions

05:47.556 --> 05:49.968
we possessed the element of surprise,
Your Royal Highness.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.763
General Cope wasna expecting us.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.552
His troops fled.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.270
And that won't happen again, sir.

05:58.149 --> 06:00.732
Perhaps if I were to arrange
a meeting with the general?

06:01.778 --> 06:04.691
Offer him generous terms
of surrender.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.940
Give him my word

06:08.034 --> 06:11.527
his men will be allowed
to march back to England unmolested.

06:17.043 --> 06:22.459
I am sure he has no more desire
to shed English blood than I have.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.174
We are all brothers after all.

06:28.471 --> 06:32.385
Even as a young lad,
you had the kindest of hearts, sir.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.513
But I fear the time for talk is done.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.475
We sailed from France to fight a war.

06:41.067 --> 06:43.479
Let us fight and be done with it.

06:44.905 --> 06:48.068
I will not risk destroying our army

06:48.658 --> 06:51.867
by ordering it to cross
potentially lethal ground.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.741
Is that clear, sir?
I will not allow it.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.321
Then resign your commission

06:56.416 --> 06:58.498
and let the prince
find himself a general

06:58.585 --> 06:59.871
with a firmer backbone!

06:59.961 --> 07:01.122
You pompous toe-rag!

07:01.212 --> 07:04.580
While you two exchange insults,
what do I tell Clan MacDonald?

07:04.674 --> 07:06.381
Tell your men
to await further orders.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.348
Which may be some time.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.789
Why must the Scots
be such intractable people?

07:39.459 --> 07:42.872
Aye, we can be pigheaded on occasion.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.041
On many an occasion.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.624
As can the Irish, I fear.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.342
Our cause must succeed, James.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.047
I promised my father,
and I have promised God.

07:56.643 --> 07:57.678
Mark me.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.645
Your noble wife will be among those
providing medical succour

08:02.732 --> 08:06.225
for those poor souls in need of such
come the cannon's roar?

08:06.319 --> 08:09.903
Aye, she's helping to set up
a field hospital

08:09.990 --> 08:11.401
even as we speak,
Your Royal Highness.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.611
Be so kind to tell her

08:14.119 --> 08:17.202
the prince asks that
British casualties be tended to

08:17.288 --> 08:18.619
before the Jacobite wounded.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.414
The British are
my father's subjects also,

08:21.501 --> 08:23.083
and I will have them well cared for.

08:24.462 --> 08:27.500
They must be made to realise
the Scots wage war upon them

08:27.632 --> 08:29.043
with the greatest of reluctance.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.501
They are our enemies now,
but one day soon

08:32.595 --> 08:33.960
they will be our friends again.

08:34.556 --> 08:37.139
I'm afraid the British have never
been a friend to the Scots.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.933
But as your friend,

08:44.024 --> 08:45.935
I would advise you
not to speak of such things

08:46.026 --> 08:47.937
within earshot of the men.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.019
They would not appreciate
such sentiment.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.654
Nor do I believe would my wife
follow such an order.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.362
From her prince, perhaps not.

09:01.666 --> 09:05.284
But surely Lady Broch Tuarach

09:05.378 --> 09:08.746
will prove obedient to an edict
from her lord and master.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.341
Aye.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.342
Enough!

10:08.149 --> 10:09.230
"Enough," ye Say?

10:10.777 --> 10:14.441
That's what he said, all right.
I heard it with these very ears.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.854
The ale ye waste now

10:15.949 --> 10:17.781
is ale ye'll probably
be wanting later.

10:18.493 --> 10:19.779
Quench the thirst of battle.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.576
"The thirst of battle," ye say?

10:22.330 --> 10:24.697
What would ye two cotters
ken of battle, eh?

10:25.083 --> 10:28.621
Cotters we may be,
but we're here, same as you.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.076
For gore and glory.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.413
Gore and glory, is it?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.958
There's no pigs
ye're slaughtering here, but men.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.634
And they'll be looking
to do the same to you.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.011
We know our task,

10:40.098 --> 10:43.636
and we'll do what needs doing
to return the king across the water.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.012
Will ye now?

10:45.103 --> 10:48.471
I bet ye Lallybroch tumshies
will turn arse

10:48.565 --> 10:51.557
and run at the first blast
of cannon fire.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.475
Ye take that back,
ye buggering wee shite!

10:53.570 --> 10:54.776
Ye fancy a doing?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.738
Come on, I'll open ye
from yer belly to yer bone!

10:57.824 --> 10:59.690
Put that blade down

10:59.784 --> 11:02.401
or I'll ram it up yer arse
until ye taste it.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.079
Ye try it, ye bushy-faced whoreson!

11:06.166 --> 11:07.907
For the love of Christ,

11:08.001 --> 11:10.208
how can a man nap
with all this blathering?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.830
Is that a dirk I see in yer hand?

11:18.052 --> 11:19.213
Angus.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.724
I see yer getting on
as well as our commanders.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.017
Have we orders, Jamie?

11:32.817 --> 11:35.184
No. Nor are we likely to

11:35.278 --> 11:38.111
while the general and O'Sullivan
remain hopping mad at each other.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.905
It sounds like someone
in the front ranks

11:39.991 --> 11:42.483
could do
with a good arse kicking, eh?

11:42.577 --> 11:44.864
If only that was all was needed.

11:45.747 --> 11:49.615
What is required
is a reconnaissance of the marshland

11:49.709 --> 11:52.201
that sits between us
and the British camp.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.165
Discover if the ground
is solid enough

11:55.256 --> 11:56.496
for our army to cross.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.085
So the plan is for us to attack?

11:58.176 --> 12:00.508
If the Quartermaster has his way.

12:01.387 --> 12:03.549
Though I'm of a mind
it's the better part of valour

12:03.640 --> 12:05.677
to force the British to come to us.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.638
But not even O'Sullivan
will countenance an attack

12:09.729 --> 12:11.766
until the question of
the ground is solved.

12:11.856 --> 12:17.192
To undertake such a mission
under the very guns of our enemies

12:17.278 --> 12:19.394
will be naught but suicide.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.732
So, eat yer fill and rest up.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.451
Save the whisky for when
we have cause to celebrate.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.991
Dougal, a word.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.593
It would be an easy thing
to have someone ride out

12:47.684 --> 12:49.140
to take a measure of the marshland.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.639
And get a musket ball between
the eyes for their trouble.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.470
Not if he's prudent.

12:54.857 --> 12:55.972
And lucky.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.312
There's no other way about it.

12:58.569 --> 13:01.027
If the ground can support
a man on horseback,

13:01.114 --> 13:02.479
it can support infantry.

13:04.575 --> 13:09.160
And is it yerselfye're nominating?

13:09.706 --> 13:12.539
'Cause if ye survive
such foolishness,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.741
the prince would have yer head
for endangering the life

13:14.836 --> 13:16.372
of one of his most trusted aides.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.039
Aye. He would not be best pleased.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.335
No.

13:24.387 --> 13:28.346
Still and all,
someone has to risk the doing.

13:33.354 --> 13:36.312
And all I need to do
is stay out of range of their guns.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.641
125 yards should do it.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.194
I was thinking more 105.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.115
The Redcoats will only be
too happy to crack away

13:47.201 --> 13:48.566
at a living, breathing target.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.574
Aye, it's a gamble,
but it's worth the risk.

13:51.914 --> 13:52.949
Besides,

13:53.374 --> 13:57.459
I'd like to prove my mettle
to the prince and Lord Murray

13:57.879 --> 13:59.665
and the rest of these jackanapes.

14:04.302 --> 14:08.136
So then, 125 yards?

14:08.723 --> 14:09.884
Or thereabouts.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.314
All right, men.

15:09.992 --> 15:13.235
Come on, then, to ranks.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.953
Load.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.831
Ready, second rank in place.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.842
Extraordinary fellow.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.842
That's Dougal MacKenzie.
That's an old friend of mine.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.393
You are?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.472
I'm your prince,
Charles Edward Stuart.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.057
Are ye really?

15:46.154 --> 15:49.772
Did ye hear that?
I'm talking to the prince.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.152
An honour to make yer acquaintance,

15:52.243 --> 15:54.075
- Your Royal Highness.
- Quite so.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.084
Easy, b0)'-

16:10.052 --> 16:11.713
Fire at Will!

16:28.362 --> 16:29.693
- Fire!
- Come on.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.244
Ease off, lads.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.768
I think we've learned
all we need to know.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.387
Quite enough.

17:44.647 --> 17:45.978
Surrender.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.938
Bravo! Bravo!

18:06.794 --> 18:09.957
Mark me, if I had 100 men like you,

18:10.798 --> 18:12.459
this war would be over tomorrow.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.960
Well, I dinna ken about that,
Your Royal Highness,

18:16.053 --> 18:19.842
but I fear that it's joyless news
that I bring back with me.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.093
Indeed.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.223
Gentlemen,

18:24.312 --> 18:27.054
there will be no glorious
Highland charge

18:27.148 --> 18:28.684
through Tranent Meadows.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.139
Damn me,

18:30.234 --> 18:33.317
we can't get to the British,
and they can't get to us.

18:33.404 --> 18:36.442
We should disengage from the enemy
under cover of darkness

18:36.532 --> 18:37.647
and return to Edinburgh.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.658
And wait for the British
to lay siege to the city?

18:42.246 --> 18:45.079
The enemy is here, General,
not in Edinburgh.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.708
Now, I look to you
to break this stalemate

18:53.299 --> 18:56.041
or I will be forced
to find myself a new general.

19:05.853 --> 19:07.719
Ye're a lucky bastard.

19:09.607 --> 19:11.598
Ye should get that looked at.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.525
Either way. It's just a scratch.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.688
And now, I'm off to change my breeks

19:18.783 --> 19:21.616
because the hero of the hour
has shat his pants.

19:33.798 --> 19:37.632
So, apparently your Dr MacPherson
left Tranent a few days ago.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.335
But fortunately, he left
his medical bag behind.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.549
The instruments in it
will prove useful,

19:43.224 --> 19:45.841
more useful than the doctor
himself probably would have.

19:46.602 --> 19:49.310
So, it is up to us
to tend to the wounded.

19:49.397 --> 19:51.889
And I have no doubt that together
we will be able to do it.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.519
Molly Cockburn, you're a strong girl.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.105
Now, your job is to see to it
that the pails and buckets

20:00.199 --> 20:01.906
are filled at all times.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.783
And use water from the well only.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.197
Yes, Lady Broch Tuarach.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.786
There's no time for all of that.
"Claire" is fine.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.124
Fergus?

20:13.421 --> 20:14.627
Please?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.746
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.756
Alice McMurdo, Madame.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.046
Alice, that's right.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.424
You are responsible for looking after
the honey water.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.963
Begging your pardon,

20:25.057 --> 20:26.968
I don't see what good
sweet water's going to do

20:27.101 --> 20:28.341
for bullet wounds.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.470
Well, for the
wounds themselves, nothing.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.897
But it will help keep
the patients' blood pressure up.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.564
Trust me, it's important.

20:38.654 --> 20:41.146
It will also help replace
any fluids lost

20:41.657 --> 20:43.068
and prevent shock.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.953
And our friend Fergus here,
he will be responsible

20:49.039 --> 20:50.621
for keeping the kettle fires burning.

20:51.459 --> 20:52.665
Women's work.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.292
I'm sorry. What was that?

20:55.379 --> 20:57.666
Nothing, Milady. Leave it to me.

20:58.507 --> 20:59.668
Thank you.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.299
Milady! Milady!

21:11.395 --> 21:12.977
This gentleman, he wishes to speak

21:13.063 --> 21:14.474
to the commander
of His Highness' army.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.681
Has information
of the utmost importance.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.392
Allina, Alice, a moment please.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.273
Sir.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.981
I'm Richard Anderson
of Whitburgh, Madame.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.191
Lady Broch Tuarach, Claire Fraser.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.697
Yes, Milady.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.699
Ye see, I've lived
in these parts all my life.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.701
My father owns the land,
so I ken the grounds

21:32.792 --> 21:34.658
where the armies are
like the back of my hand.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.750
There's a way down from the ridge
where the Highland troops are.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.633
A small, hidden trail that will
lead them past the bog at the bottom

21:43.761 --> 21:45.251
to catch the English unawares.

21:47.473 --> 21:48.804
- I see.
- If I may speak

21:49.058 --> 21:52.301
to a commander,
perhaps Lord Murray himself.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.018
Fergus, do you think
you can find your master?

21:58.108 --> 21:59.314
Yes, I will find him.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.983
Go now, but be careful.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.402
Tell him to come back straightaway
to speak with Mr Anderson.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.199
Here, you say?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.823
Aye. Or thereabouts.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.496
I don't ken much from maps.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.038
There's no such path marked.

22:15.125 --> 22:17.036
Marked or no, it's there.

22:17.127 --> 22:19.664
As I told Mrs Fraser,
it's a narrow, winding path,

22:19.755 --> 22:22.417
hard to spot in daylight,
and hopeless to find in the dark.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.465
Unless ye ken where to look.

22:24.552 --> 22:25.633
And you do?

22:27.680 --> 22:28.966
Aye, I do.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.685
Fortune drops out of the sky
and onto our doorstep.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.095
Convenient, is it not?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.514
If we dare trust this boy.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.527
And ye're willing to lead us
across the meadows?

22:45.614 --> 22:46.945
There's no other way for it.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.815
I'm no much for fighting,

22:48.909 --> 22:50.900
but I'll get ye from here to there
without a misstep.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.612
Thank you, Mr Anderson.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.619
Your help is much appreciated.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.542
I do wish that John was here.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.706
I pray I might hear his opinion.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.376
And I pray the Quartermaster
is off somewhere

23:04.466 --> 23:07.003
gathering much needed victuals
for this army.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.461
Delay could prove fatal,
Your Royal Highness.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.770
Off we go, gentlemen.

23:23.903 --> 23:27.237
Now we shall not return
unless we bring victory back with us.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.572
I'm not saying it's going to happen,

23:33.662 --> 23:36.029
but if it does,
if I'm to fall in battle,

23:36.206 --> 23:37.617
it would ease me greatly to know

23:37.833 --> 23:39.744
that you'll watch over
Bess and the croft.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.331
And I'll do the same for you,
if it proves necessary.

23:42.588 --> 23:44.955
My Marina and the six bairns?

23:47.843 --> 23:49.333
I'd wish them on no man.

23:50.137 --> 23:53.880
Listen, there's a wee bit of coin
buried south of the pigsty.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.806
She-devil knows where.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.971
- Then it's settled.
- Aye.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.807
What's mine is yours, and yours mine.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.492
You can have my sword.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.279
And my dirk.

24:20.542 --> 24:24.410
And my sporran.
And all that it contains, eh?

24:24.797 --> 24:26.253
What are you havering about now?

24:26.882 --> 24:28.247
Were ye no listening to those two?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.759
What's his is his.

24:33.347 --> 24:35.133
What's mine is yours.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.925
What use would I have for a sword
that's never been used?

24:40.020 --> 24:42.762
Ye think I need a fat man's blade
dangling from my hip?

24:47.194 --> 24:48.605
It occurs to me

24:49.697 --> 24:51.529
I'll be leaving Scarlet
to ye as well.

24:53.909 --> 24:55.024
Scarlet the whore?

24:56.412 --> 24:57.527
Part-time whore.

24:58.789 --> 24:59.870
Full-time barmaid.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.289
She's not yours to give,
ye daft bastard.

25:02.501 --> 25:04.458
Well, I'm saying she is.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.462
And it's ye I'll be giving her to.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.708
Do ye accept?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.383
I do not.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.472
Now shut yer gab

25:18.600 --> 25:20.887
before ye bring
the devil's own eye upon us.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.770
If ye dinna put that Whetstone down,

25:28.861 --> 25:31.319
ye'll be grinding that blade
to a needle.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.364
May as well get it off yer chest.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.364
Whatever it is.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.669
It's just...

25:52.509 --> 25:56.002
In a raid,
every man has a part to play.

25:57.264 --> 26:00.802
You tell yerself that
the raid's success or failure

26:01.935 --> 26:03.676
is dependent on yer actions.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.189
And if ye're forced
to wound a man, kill him even,

26:10.569 --> 26:15.029
chances are
ye stare into his eyes when doing it.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.281
And if you were to be killed,

26:22.790 --> 26:27.375
ye'd die knowing that yer memory
would live on within yer clan.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.457
Yer death would have meaning.

26:33.217 --> 26:34.582
But this...

26:36.553 --> 26:37.964
This is different.

26:38.305 --> 26:42.219
We're but part of
a 2,000-strong army.

26:42.351 --> 26:45.059
My death, your death,
alone would be meaningless.

26:45.896 --> 26:48.809
500, 1,000 would have to be slain

26:49.149 --> 26:52.062
before our deaths
take on any meaning.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.362
That's not a very comforting
thought on the eve of battle.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.699
Aye.

27:02.579 --> 27:03.865
It weighs on me.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.995
If it's words of comfort ye're
looking for, I've none to give.

27:14.925 --> 27:16.165
In Paris,

27:17.761 --> 27:19.798
I almost lost my marriage

27:20.139 --> 27:22.301
trying to stop all of this
from happening.

27:27.646 --> 27:28.681
I failed.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.516
We.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.268
We failed.

27:39.324 --> 27:43.033
If there's any solace,
I feel much the same way you do.

27:44.121 --> 27:46.237
Aye. It is.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.054
Make sure
you get some sleep, Sassenach.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.224
Tomorrow will be a trying day
for us all.

28:07.728 --> 28:10.846
I don't think sleep will be an option
for anyone tonight.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.061
Milady, Milord.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.311
I request permission

28:15.402 --> 28:16.984
to join you in the fight
that is to come.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.194
And who will keep
the hospital fires burning?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.481
I'm sure someone else
can handle such work.

28:23.368 --> 28:26.156
I can sneak into the very tent
of General Cope.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.486
I will steal his sword.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.413
A general cannot fight
without his sword.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.450
I don't doubt
yer capabilities, laddie.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.786
But without you,
who will look after the women?

28:36.423 --> 28:39.211
The same person who keeps
the fires lit, I don't know.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.836
And what of
our Lady Broch Tuarach, huh?

28:43.972 --> 28:46.634
There's no one I trust
with her safety more than you.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.225
Looks like you're going
to have to stay and like it.

28:50.395 --> 28:51.556
Is that understood?

28:52.731 --> 28:53.892
Jamie.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.765
It's time.

28:56.318 --> 28:58.855
It's time to send
the British army to hell.

28:58.987 --> 29:02.776
If you ask me,
the British don't stand a chance.

29:06.245 --> 29:07.406
Angus.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.078
Surely there's another woman
you can have kiss you goodbye.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.326
None that will have him.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.956
Must I remind you, Mistress,

29:13.126 --> 29:14.582
that this time tomorrow

29:14.836 --> 29:16.747
I could be laying in a field
bleeding to death?

29:17.714 --> 29:19.500
I would hate
for my last thought to be

29:19.591 --> 29:22.629
how you denied me my final request.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.051
You are shameless.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.640
I'll not say goodbye to ye, Claire.

29:33.730 --> 29:35.516
There's no need to, since none of us

29:35.607 --> 29:38.019
will be meeting our maker
in this place.

29:39.403 --> 29:42.771
When we meet again,
it'll be to embrace in victory

29:42.864 --> 29:44.150
and share a stiff dram.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.696
Mistress.

29:59.923 --> 30:01.163
Watch over Jamie.

30:01.425 --> 30:02.586
Always.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.801
We will win the day, correct?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.296
It is the promise of history.

30:12.269 --> 30:15.978
Yes, we will win this day.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.393
So we shall.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.051
On your way, soldier.

31:55.705 --> 31:58.493
Get some rest, all of you.
That's an order.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.879
Have any of you seen Fergus?

32:27.028 --> 32:29.611
I'll be leaving you now
if it's all the same to you, General.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.361
I'm no general,
but all of Scotland's in your debt.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.657
General Murray,

32:38.790 --> 32:41.248
you see the prince stays here
out of harm's way.

32:41.585 --> 32:42.950
Ishaflindeed.

32:43.503 --> 32:44.834
Gentlemen,

32:45.297 --> 32:47.789
must I remind you
that this is my army?

32:49.134 --> 32:51.171
Now I very much desire
to lead them into battle.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.294
It is my right and my destiny.

32:53.889 --> 32:57.007
I carry a sword,
and I am trained in its use.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.467
I dinna doubt it,
but Your Royal Highness must realise

32:59.603 --> 33:01.844
this rebellion would never
survive your death.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.305
Besides, regaining the throne
would never mean as much

33:04.399 --> 33:06.982
to King James if the son
that made it possible

33:07.068 --> 33:08.684
wasna there to share
the moment wi' him.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.073
A touching sentiment, James.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.363
Mark me,

33:17.454 --> 33:19.741
I don't believe my father
is all that fond of me.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.951
Nevertheless, ye shall remain
behind the lines

33:25.045 --> 33:27.753
with the Quartermaster
and the Lord General.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.639
I need these strips
to be a little wider.

33:38.725 --> 33:39.806
<i>Yes, Madame.</i>

33:44.481 --> 33:46.188
That looks good. Just keep going.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.489
I know what you're all feeling.

34:00.330 --> 34:01.616
I've been there myself.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.917
The fear. The self-doubt.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.292
But our men are depending on us.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.003
And we will not let them down.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.938
Boil these again.
They need to be spotless.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.436
Right away.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.549
Everyone up! Get up!

35:56.279 --> 35:59.067
"He that dwelleth
in the secret place of the most High

35:59.282 --> 36:01.694
"shall abide under the shadow
of the Almighty.

36:01.785 --> 36:03.116
"I will say of the Lord..."

36:03.203 --> 36:04.659
Go get more firewood, please.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.657
We're going to need
lots and lots of hot water.

36:08.208 --> 36:12.122
"He is my refuge
and my fortress, my God,

36:12.671 --> 36:13.957
<i>"in Him Will I trust."</i>

36:55.505 --> 36:57.997
I'm sorry, lad,
ye'll have to bite it tight.

36:58.299 --> 36:59.414
Ross?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.250
Come with me.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.137
Could someone get
some more hot water?

37:07.767 --> 37:09.303
More dressings!

37:11.438 --> 37:13.145
If ye could rip more dressings!

37:16.818 --> 37:17.979
I'm sorry.

37:20.572 --> 37:21.733
Sorry?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.489
He's gone.

37:28.621 --> 37:29.656
Claire.

37:35.837 --> 37:37.419
There's nothing more I can do.

38:12.916 --> 38:13.997
Come on!

38:28.890 --> 38:29.971
Stand your ground, you dogs!

38:30.058 --> 38:32.174
Don't turn your back
on these traitors!

38:33.353 --> 38:34.559
Stand your ground!

38:50.245 --> 38:52.737
The British!
The British prisoners are here.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.333
We mean you no harm, Madame.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.043
But we do require your assistance.

39:01.214 --> 39:03.876
Allina, sort these men out by
the severity of their wounds.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.381
Come with me.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.296
You two, over there.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.086
Get this man on to a bed.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.172
Rupert, he needs you, Mistress.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.553
Rupert, I'll be there in a second.

39:14.769 --> 39:15.850
Now!

39:18.356 --> 39:20.973
- Allina, take over here.
- Yes, ma'am.

39:23.111 --> 39:24.351
Ye must save him, Mistress.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.900
I'll no allow that fat bawbag
to die on me.

39:35.164 --> 39:38.498
Molly, we have to close this wound
before an infection sets in.

39:38.668 --> 39:40.500
Get me hot water,
a large needle, and thread.

39:40.628 --> 39:41.868
- Now!
- Right away, Mistress.

39:41.963 --> 39:46.378
Angus. Where's Angus. Is he blown up?

39:47.176 --> 39:48.257
Tell me!

39:48.595 --> 39:49.756
What's he talking about?

39:49.846 --> 39:51.428
It's just a cannon blast.
It's nothing.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.846
<i>Damn it all!</i>

39:56.936 --> 39:58.142
<i>Stand your ground!</i>

40:17.707 --> 40:18.822
Come on.

40:57.830 --> 41:00.663
Tell me true, Mistress, will he live?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.452
I wish I knew.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.708
But he's strong,

41:08.091 --> 41:09.798
and if the wound
doesn't fester, then...

41:11.803 --> 41:13.760
Let me see that head of yours.

41:14.931 --> 41:16.046
Come on.

41:21.938 --> 41:24.054
Your eyes are clear. Any nausea?

41:24.399 --> 41:25.981
No. I told ye, I'm fine.

41:26.776 --> 41:29.017
Well, if it's anything,
it's a mild concussion.

41:29.112 --> 41:32.776
So you can stay here by Rupert,
but no napping, I want you awake.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.320
Well, I must admit, I'm bone-weary,

41:38.830 --> 41:42.289
but I'll be keeping both eyes
on this big belly

41:42.458 --> 41:43.619
going up and down.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.123
Well, as long as it does,
there's hope.

41:48.256 --> 41:49.337
Aye.

41:56.222 --> 42:00.056
The day is ours, Sassenach.

42:01.102 --> 42:02.888
The British are routed.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.678
General Cope is in retreat,

42:04.814 --> 42:06.805
leaving hundreds of dead
and wounded behind.

42:10.028 --> 42:12.645
And our losses can't number
more than 50 men.

42:14.282 --> 42:16.614
The whole thing
took all of 15 minutes.

42:16.868 --> 42:18.609
If only we had cavalry,

42:18.995 --> 42:20.986
we could have pursued the enemy,
captured General Cope,

42:21.330 --> 42:23.367
perhaps put an end to the rebellion
this very morning.

42:38.181 --> 42:41.139
Where's Fergus?
I'm sure he went to fight.

42:41.225 --> 42:43.887
Dinna fash, Sassenach.
Take a wee peek outside.

42:52.653 --> 42:53.859
Fergus!

42:54.906 --> 42:56.067
You wretch!

42:56.157 --> 42:58.398
What do you mean
by sneaking off like that?

42:59.702 --> 43:02.069
Should box your ears
until your head rattles.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.163
- Milady.
- Are you all right?

43:06.751 --> 43:07.832
L.-

43:10.338 --> 43:12.500
I killed an English soldier, Milady.

43:14.592 --> 43:16.003
Don't tell me that.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.758
I think I killed him.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.673
He fell down.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.266
I had a knife.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.019
I struck him.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.435
God, Fergus.

43:33.027 --> 43:34.609
I'm so sorry.

43:35.613 --> 43:37.195
You aren't injured, are you?

43:37.281 --> 43:38.396
No.

43:41.202 --> 43:45.036
I'm just tired.

43:45.623 --> 43:46.954
Very, very tired.

43:54.966 --> 43:56.422
Come with me.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.293
I'll get you some food,
somewhere to sleep.

44:27.123 --> 44:28.454
Dougal MacKenzie.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.333
Do I know ye?

44:33.629 --> 44:35.290
Lieutenant Jeremy Foster.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.334
I accompanied you
and the lady Claire Beauchamp

44:37.425 --> 44:39.086
to the village of Brockton.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.841
Aye.

44:41.679 --> 44:46.298
The only honourable Redcoat
in Lord Thomas' staff.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.302
I would be much obliged if you would
see me to your infirmary.

44:52.273 --> 44:56.016
Ye expect me to carry ye to Tranent?
I've still got work to do here.

44:57.111 --> 44:59.102
Is your thirst for slaughter
not quenched yet?

44:59.197 --> 45:00.687
You've won a great victory today.

45:01.157 --> 45:02.192
Aye.

45:02.825 --> 45:05.032
And I wager there'll be
many more to follow.

45:08.956 --> 45:10.367
A war chief should know better.

45:11.876 --> 45:15.710
I tell you this in all candour,
you cannot defeat the British army.

45:16.672 --> 45:18.959
You've won a battle,
but you will never win this war.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.389
Well...

45:36.859 --> 45:38.145
No. No!

45:38.236 --> 45:40.318
God alone knows the answer to that.

45:42.907 --> 45:44.068
Shush.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.157
There, there.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.494
And if so,

45:53.417 --> 45:55.158
I'll look for you in hell.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.108
We did not run.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.085
<i>Dmna {ash yerse“,</i>

46:43.634 --> 46:45.875
that blubber no doubt
protected his innards.

46:46.262 --> 46:47.297
Aye.

46:47.930 --> 46:50.718
Must have been those third portions
he gobbled that did it.

46:52.727 --> 46:54.138
Aye, the man could eat.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.806
Can eat, I meant to say.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.735
Easy now, ally,

47:05.406 --> 47:07.147
-you look done in.
- No, it's just...

47:07.992 --> 47:09.153
It's been a long night.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.000
What is that?

47:24.425 --> 47:26.917
You look like you got stepped on
by a horse.

47:27.011 --> 47:28.342
Because I was.

47:29.305 --> 47:33.674
The British were in such retreat
an officer galloped right over me.

47:38.606 --> 47:40.643
Here, fill this.

47:40.941 --> 47:43.933
You've had 400 weight of horse
step on your kidney.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.518
I want to see if there's
any blood in your urine.

48:12.014 --> 48:13.129
Here.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.052
Hold this while I take aim.

48:16.644 --> 48:20.683
Six pence says you can't make it
from where you stand.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.561
I wouldna say it was easy,

48:24.652 --> 48:27.144
but for six pence,
I'll make the effort.

48:27.238 --> 48:30.151
Silence, everyone.
Let the man concentrate.

48:40.668 --> 48:42.158
Madame Fraser,

48:42.878 --> 48:45.916
your labours on our behalf
are much appreciated.

48:47.258 --> 48:49.044
Your Royal Highness.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.423
Please be careful of the blood,
the floor is slippery.

49:00.271 --> 49:03.559
I bring you the blessing
and gratitude of my father.

49:04.275 --> 49:07.188
Your deeds today
will be forever remembered.

49:08.946 --> 49:11.608
If this victory had been
obtained over foreigners,

49:11.907 --> 49:13.443
my joy would be complete.

49:13.576 --> 49:18.946
But as it is over Englishmen,
it brings a damp chill over my heart.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.456
I say to you all,

49:24.295 --> 49:27.128
I came here in the interests
of both our countries,

49:27.214 --> 49:30.252
which are, in truth, but one country.

49:32.595 --> 49:35.462
- My father will tell me...
- Victory is ours!

49:35.723 --> 49:38.215
Let the writing of the ballads begin.

49:38.309 --> 49:39.424
Dougal!

49:41.103 --> 49:43.310
What's this, then? What?

49:43.397 --> 49:45.559
Do ye mean to tell me
ye been tending this scum

49:45.649 --> 49:46.980
as if they were yer own kin?

49:47.109 --> 49:48.725
Dougal, the British were
taught a lesson this morning

49:48.986 --> 49:50.226
they are not soon to forget.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.402
Like bloody hell.

49:51.489 --> 49:52.979
I say we put an end
to this shit here...

49:53.115 --> 49:54.822
Killing these men
willna add to our victory.

49:54.950 --> 49:56.816
Ye call these bastards "men"?

49:56.952 --> 49:58.488
Yes.

49:59.288 --> 50:00.369
Men.

50:01.874 --> 50:03.990
And they are my father's subjects.

50:09.340 --> 50:12.298
And each one of them is your brother.

50:15.804 --> 50:18.671
My God, sir, where is
your Christian charity?

50:20.226 --> 50:21.466
James,

50:21.560 --> 50:23.301
I wish for you
to remove this gentleman

50:23.395 --> 50:25.352
from the muster roll immediately.

50:25.481 --> 50:27.939
There is no place
for such wanton disregard

50:28.025 --> 50:30.016
for Englishmen in my army.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.203
Dougal MacKenzie is a true warrior.

50:47.670 --> 50:52.540
Your Royal Highness, I ken it well,
despite his foolish tongue.

51:01.058 --> 51:04.722
If this army is to triumph, we'll
need every warrior we can muster.

51:05.062 --> 51:06.393
Yes, James.

51:07.106 --> 51:10.440
And the fastest horse will
undoubtedly win the race.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.229
Now what good is it

51:12.444 --> 51:15.903
when its master is tossed
from its saddle in the process?

51:16.198 --> 51:18.906
What am I to do with such
a blood-thirsty barbarian?

51:19.243 --> 51:21.735
We promote him,

51:25.791 --> 51:26.906
Your Royal Highness.

51:27.710 --> 51:31.544
As captain of the newly formed

51:31.630 --> 51:33.746
Highlander Dragoons,

51:34.133 --> 51:38.548
give him 15 of our best riders
and horses.

51:39.305 --> 51:43.720
Let them follow the enemy,
report on troop movements,

51:43.976 --> 51:45.466
harass his supply lines.

51:45.978 --> 51:48.310
That way, we use his abilities.

51:52.276 --> 51:54.768
And Your Royal Highness
will never have to lay eyes upon him.

52:01.452 --> 52:03.568
You have an ingenious mind, James.

52:13.422 --> 52:15.333
You are in his debt, rogue.

52:16.592 --> 52:19.425
See that he does not come
to lament his benevolence.

52:36.987 --> 52:38.603
I thank you, lad.

52:39.114 --> 52:40.275
Truly.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.445
And I swear

52:43.535 --> 52:46.152
that I will not give you cause
to regret your generosity.

52:48.499 --> 52:49.989
But I know what ye're up to.

52:53.504 --> 52:58.419
Ye champion me and ye exile me,
both at the same time.

52:58.509 --> 53:00.500
That's a plan worthy
of my brother Colum.

53:07.810 --> 53:09.016
Angus, how's Rupert?

53:11.897 --> 53:13.808
Talk to me, man.
He's my friend as well.

53:15.150 --> 53:16.231
Claire!

53:16.819 --> 53:17.900
Angus!

53:23.033 --> 53:24.649
Oh, my God, the cannon blast.

53:25.494 --> 53:28.737
He's been bleeding internally
this whole time. Angus.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.078
Is there nothing you can do?

56:07.197 --> 56:09.985
I expected the flavour
of victory to taste sweeter.

56:11.535 --> 56:14.243
Aye. War tastes bitter,
no matter the outcome.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.699
Well, Claire,

56:20.919 --> 56:24.253
turns out you were right
about Prestonpans after all.

56:25.757 --> 56:27.373
I was, wasn't I?

56:32.556 --> 56:34.638
That means I'm also right

56:34.725 --> 56:36.887
about the disaster
awaiting us at Culloden.

56:39.563 --> 56:43.477
<i>Down, down, down, down</i>

56:43.567 --> 56:45.729
<i>Here's a health to the king</i>

56:45.903 --> 56:48.190
<i>And a lasting peace</i>

56:48.614 --> 56:53.074
<i>To factions end and wealth increase</i>

56:53.410 --> 56:57.404
<i>Come, let us drink
while we have breath</i>

56:57.581 --> 57:01.950
<i>For there's no drinking after death</i>

57:04.713 --> 57:07.421
<i>And he that would</i>

57:07.925 --> 57:11.043
<i>This toast deny</i>

57:15.641 --> 57:18.258
<i>Down among the dead men</i>

57:18.477 --> 57:20.889
<i>Down among the dead men</i>

57:21.063 --> 57:24.977
<i>Down, down, down, down</i>

57:26.109 --> 57:30.148
<i>Down among the dead men, let him lie</i>
