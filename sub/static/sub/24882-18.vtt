is a salsa?

02:04.567 --> 02:07.333
Ho ho! Salsa dancing
is my favorite.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.500
Salsa music has
a great Latin dance beat.

Listen.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.400
Ho ho ho!

Whoa! Oh, my!
Hoo hoo!

03:00.266 --> 03:03.400

Hey. How about
the Snuffle Okey

04:42.367 --> 04:44.533
Oh. Oh, it, uh,
sounds interesting, Snuff.

04:44.533 --> 04:45.834

Snuff.

- Don't worry. It's fine.

05:17.433 --> 05:19.700
Oh, that's okay, Snuffy.
You didn't mean to.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.467
Oh. Maybe we should
choose a dance

05:22.467 --> 05:25.300
without any spinning
in it, Bird.

05:25.300 --> 05:26.867

See you guys! Ha ha ha!
Hey. You know what?

05:35.333 --> 05:37.166
I actually have to get
back to the store,

05:37.166 --> 05:39.166
but, uh, keep on dancing.

05:39.166 --> 05:40.800

Come on.
Let's go see.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.166
Okay.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.567
Oh, no.
Look at that.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.333
Telly and Rosita,
what's going on?

05:51.333 --> 05:56.467
Oh. Rosita and I are watching
these dancers do--

05:56.467 --> 05:58.400
The Chicken Dance.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.200
Why does watching
the Chicken Dance

06:16.200 --> 06:18.500
make Telly and Rosita
feel sad?

06:18.500 --> 06:21.266
B-b-b-- oh!

06:21.266 --> 06:24.000
Because it's
our favorite dance.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.166
But we don't know
how to do it.

06:27.166 --> 06:30.066
- You guys, hello! Yahoo.
- You guys.

06:30.066 --> 06:32.667
I can teach you how
to do the Chicken Dance.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.233
- Nina: Yeah.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.500
Elmo:
Oh, ho ho! Sure.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.233
Nina knows every dance

06:38.233 --> 06:41.233
from all around
the whole world.

06:41.233 --> 06:43.600
- Yep.
- But it looks so hard!

06:43.600 --> 06:46.100
Yeah. How will we
ever learn it?

06:46.100 --> 06:48.033
The same way you
learn any dance--

06:48.033 --> 06:50.133
one step at a time,

06:50.133 --> 06:51.567
and you can learn
it, too.

06:51.567 --> 06:54.967
First, you make your hands
into chicken beaks like this.

06:54.967 --> 06:56.867
Ready?
Bawk, bawk, bawk.

06:56.867 --> 06:57.900
Okay.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.133
All:
Bawk, bawk, bawk.

06:59.133 --> 07:00.800
Yeah.
Now flap your wings.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.667
Flap, flap, flap.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.133
All:
Flap, flap, flap.

07:04.133 --> 07:05.467
Nice. Now shake
your tail feather.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.033
Shake, shake, shake.

07:07.033 --> 07:08.400
All:

07:12.200 --> 07:13.433
All:
Clap, clap, clap.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.867
Wait, wait, wait.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.300
Why are we learning
all these simple moves?

07:17.300 --> 07:19.934
Well, because when you put all
these simple moves together,

07:19.934 --> 07:21.734
you're doing
the Chicken Dance.

07:21.734 --> 07:25.033
Yeah! Oh, Elmo wants
to do the Chicken Dance, too.

07:25.033 --> 07:27.266

Gracias,  Elmo.

07:50.133 --> 07:51.567
De nada.  Anytime.

07:51.567 --> 07:54.033
- Nina, Elmo.

07:54.033 --> 07:56.100
We found a dance
we both love.

07:56.100 --> 07:58.667
- With no spinning.
- No spinning.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.834
That's great!
Oh. What's it called?

08:00.834 --> 08:03.934
- It's called
the Happy Hop.
- Mm-hmm.

08:03.934 --> 08:06.700
- Come on,
let's show them, Snuff.
- Okay, Bird.

08:06.700 --> 08:09.433

08:24.900 --> 08:26.333
What's the matter?

08:26.333 --> 08:29.266
Well, when Snuffy hops,
the whole street shakes.

08:29.266 --> 08:31.567
And we can't dance
if the whole street
is shaking.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.700
- No.
- Oh, Bird.

08:33.700 --> 08:36.700
When I spin,
I knock everybody down,

08:36.700 --> 08:40.400
and when I hop,
I shake the whole street.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.867
Maybe it's better
if I don't dance at all.

08:43.867 --> 08:47.533
Oh, but, Snuffy,
you're my best friend.

08:47.533 --> 08:51.266
I don't want to dance

08:51.266 --> 08:52.867
Oh. Well,

09:09.433 --> 09:11.767
Gee.
You think so, Nina?

09:11.767 --> 09:14.266
Can you really find
a dance for Bird and me?

09:14.266 --> 09:16.066
Yeah, one with
no spinning in it?

09:16.066 --> 09:17.533
Or hopping?

09:17.533 --> 09:19.100
- Mm-hmm.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.800
As a matter of fact,
there is a dance.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.500
It's called the conga.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.033
Hmm.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.200
Yeah. It's a line dance
from Cuba.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.266
No hopping, no spinning.

09:30.266 --> 09:33.066
Ah, but will
we love it?

Oh, yeah.
Everybody loves the conga.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.367

clapping called palmas.

16:04.667 --> 16:05.767
We use our feet.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.500
We use the whole foot,
and we strike the floor

16:07.500 --> 16:10.033
with the whole foot,
and we call that a golpe.

16:10.033 --> 16:11.734
- Murray: Golpe.

20:37.500 --> 20:41.767
Oh, guess what Elmo
is wondering about today.

20:41.767 --> 20:44.133
Wait for it.

20:44.133 --> 20:47.266
Wai-ai-ait for it.

20:47.266 --> 20:50.467
Oh! Dancing!

20:50.467 --> 20:52.900
Oh, nice dance moves,
Zoe.

20:52.900 --> 20:55.266
Boy, Elmo loves dancing

20:55.266 --> 20:57.834
and wants to find out
more about it.

20:57.834 --> 21:02.000
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.100
Let's call her together.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.600
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:06.600 --> 21:08.834
( chime playing
"Elmo's song")

21:08.834 --> 21:10.867
Hey!
Look at me, Elmo.

21:10.867 --> 21:14.834
Can you tell what I'm doing?
Whoooa!

21:14.834 --> 21:16.500
Falling down?

21:16.500 --> 21:18.767
No! Dancing.

21:18.767 --> 21:22.166
- Oh, ho ho!
- And I love dancing.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.467
Oh, well,
that's perfect

21:23.467 --> 21:27.233
because today,
Elmo wants to learn
more about dancing.

21:27.233 --> 21:30.133
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:30.133 --> 21:33.734
All:
We look it up.

21:33.734 --> 21:36.600
Searching for dances.
Here we go.

21:38.600 --> 21:42.066
Oh, wow! There are
all kinds of dances--

21:42.066 --> 21:45.667
Latin dances,
Caribbean dances,

21:45.667 --> 21:49.567
Native American dances,
African dances,

21:49.567 --> 21:53.100
and even crazy, made-up,
wacky dances.

21:53.100 --> 21:57.300
You can dance fast.
You can dance slow.

21:57.300 --> 22:00.900
You can dance high.
You can dance low.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.433
And dancing
is great exercise.

22:03.433 --> 22:06.433
It gets your heart pumping,
your muscles moving,

22:06.433 --> 22:09.300
and it's lots of fun!

22:09.300 --> 22:12.567
Wow! That does
look like fun.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.066
It is!
Oh, got to boogie.

22:15.066 --> 22:17.800
I'm late for
my ballet class.
See you, Elmo.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.767
Oh, ho ho!
Thank you, Smartie.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.834
Bye-bye.
Ha ha ha!

22:21.834 --> 22:26.066
Boy, there's so many
different kinds of dances.

22:26.066 --> 22:29.800
Hey!
That gives Elmo an idea!

22:29.800 --> 22:32.633
Oh, let's play
a game together.

22:32.633 --> 22:36.133
Yeah! Come on, come on.
Ha ha!

22:42.667 --> 22:46.700
Oh! Boy, Elmo wonders
if we can match the shoes

22:46.700 --> 22:48.333
to the dancers!

22:48.333 --> 22:51.433
Are you ready?
Let's play.

22:51.433 --> 22:56.667
Which of these shoes goes with
which of these dancers?

22:56.667 --> 22:59.166
Kid #1:
That one looks
like a ballerina.

22:59.166 --> 23:01.767
Elmo:
Do ballerinas
wear tap shoes?

23:01.767 --> 23:04.100
Kid #1:
No, they wear ballet shoes.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.767
Elmo:
Yeah! That's right.

23:07.767 --> 23:09.467
Now, what about this guy?

23:09.467 --> 23:12.367
Would he wear...
bunny slippers?

23:12.367 --> 23:14.600
Kid #1:
No, he's a tap dancer.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.567
Slippers don't make
a tapping sound.

23:16.567 --> 23:19.633
Elmo:
So what kind of shoes
does he wear?

23:19.633 --> 23:21.533
Kid #1:
Tap shoes!

23:21.533 --> 23:23.200
- Elmo: Oh!

23:23.200 --> 23:27.100
So the bunny slippers
must go on this person.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.700
Kid #1:
But that's not a dancer.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.433
Elmo:
Oh, she's not a dancer--
oh, ho ho--

23:31.433 --> 23:34.200
unless she's dancing
the bunny hop.

23:34.200 --> 23:39.433
Wow! Boy, so many people
like to dance,

23:39.433 --> 23:42.934
and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:42.934 --> 23:45.834
Does Mr. Noodle like
to dance?

23:45.834 --> 23:47.166
