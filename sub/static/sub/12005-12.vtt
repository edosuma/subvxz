<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:01.502 --> 00:03.840
<i>Bay: I found another job
working at that amusement park,</i>

00:03.856 --> 00:04.897
<i>Maui, Kansas.</i>

00:04.935 --> 00:05.949
I'm on games.

00:06.069 --> 00:07.125
Where's Lana?

00:07.148 --> 00:08.329
She took the baby and left.

00:08.368 --> 00:10.316
The nurse just told me
she had a plane to catch.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.779
We're engaged... to be married.

00:12.818 --> 00:14.640
<i>I wanted you to have this.</i>

00:14.961 --> 00:17.182
You can hang it up in Iraq,

00:17.175 --> 00:18.254
or Afghanistan,

00:18.309 --> 00:21.288
<i>or wherever "istan" you end up.</i>

00:21.717 --> 00:22.683
Hey.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.585
Oh my God, you're back.

00:25.888 --> 00:28.422
Don't ever disrespect
a girl like that again,

00:28.440 --> 00:29.473
do you hear me? Ever!

00:29.524 --> 00:30.725
- Ty, don't!
- I'm sorry.

00:30.759 --> 00:32.659
Where are you going?

00:32.694 --> 00:33.661
<i>I talked to Angelo... </i>

00:33.695 --> 00:35.429
he said I could stay over there.

00:35.464 --> 00:36.631
I don't understand.

00:36.665 --> 00:38.466
Why'd she go to Angelo's?

00:38.500 --> 00:41.369
I guess she needed some alone time.

00:41.403 --> 00:43.304
Can I stay the night?

00:43.338 --> 00:45.573
You can stay as long as you want.

01:02.541 --> 01:05.358
(Sighs) Morning.

01:05.394 --> 01:07.194
Morning.

01:07.229 --> 01:10.197
I wasn't sure if I should wake you.

01:10.232 --> 01:13.100
Oh, I don't have to be
at the park till 10:00.

01:13.135 --> 01:14.969
Is that pizza?

01:16.405 --> 01:19.040
Uh, you want some eggs or something?

01:19.074 --> 01:20.274
No, I'm good.

01:20.309 --> 01:23.077
Well, at least let me heat it up for you.

01:23.111 --> 01:24.378
I did manage to figure
out the toaster oven.

01:24.413 --> 01:26.147
No, it's better this way.

01:26.181 --> 01:28.249
I'm savoring my last few hours of freedom.

01:28.283 --> 01:31.052
Right. Because it's such
a prison where you live.

01:31.086 --> 01:33.821
(Chuckles)

01:33.855 --> 01:35.990
Can I have some coffee?

01:36.024 --> 01:37.158
Sure. Knock yourself out.

01:41.163 --> 01:42.964
(Sighs)

01:42.998 --> 01:44.765
Uh...

01:44.800 --> 01:47.101
So when is Angelo coming back?

01:47.119 --> 01:49.971
Well, he's about to meet
this family in Atlanta.

01:50.005 --> 01:52.873
<i>So I guess however long it
takes to convince someone</i>

01:52.908 --> 01:55.142
that they accidentally adopted his baby.

01:55.177 --> 01:57.712
So you're staying until he gets back?

01:57.746 --> 02:00.614
Just until I find a job, I think.

02:00.649 --> 02:01.882
You are welcome to stay.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.751
<i>- Are you sure?
- Of course.</i>

02:03.785 --> 02:05.052
Because I don't want to be crowding you.

02:05.087 --> 02:07.555
(Sighs)

02:07.589 --> 02:08.823
You are not crowding me.

02:08.857 --> 02:11.525
You can't move out!

02:11.560 --> 02:12.860
I'm not moving out.

02:12.894 --> 02:14.962
I'm just gonna keep Regina
company while Angelo's gone.

02:14.997 --> 02:19.467
You know, I think Regina went
over there to get some space.

02:19.501 --> 02:20.835
Regina's cool with it.

02:20.869 --> 02:24.739
Honey, you were in the
Galapagos last summer.

02:24.773 --> 02:26.741
Mom, Angelo's place is
in the same zip code.

02:26.775 --> 02:28.743
You're still gonna see me.
You won't even know I'm gone.

02:28.777 --> 02:30.578
<i>Daphne: Morning.</i>

02:32.547 --> 02:34.582
And you'll have another daughter around.

02:35.751 --> 02:37.351
I hope you guys are hungry,

02:37.385 --> 02:40.688
I'm making Belgian
waffles with fresh berries.

02:40.722 --> 02:42.623
Oh, thanks, but I already had pizza.

02:42.657 --> 02:44.291
For breakfast?

02:44.326 --> 02:46.761
And I should probably go pack.

02:46.795 --> 02:49.397
We need to discuss this
with your father first.

02:49.431 --> 02:51.732
Why? We already know what he's gonna say.

02:51.767 --> 02:53.317
Hey, what's going on?

02:55.637 --> 02:57.338
Okay.

02:57.372 --> 02:59.340
Thanks, mom.

02:59.374 --> 03:02.143
Did she just say "pack"? Where's she going?

03:02.177 --> 03:05.346
She's going to stay with
Regina for a little while.

03:05.380 --> 03:06.547
Why?

03:09.317 --> 03:11.035
Hey.

03:11.069 --> 03:13.037
Hey.

03:13.071 --> 03:15.022
I didn't mean to crowd you out.

03:15.057 --> 03:17.024
Oh, it's okay.

03:17.059 --> 03:19.427
I mean, things have been weird lately.

03:19.461 --> 03:22.329
I'll just move back into the guest house

03:22.364 --> 03:23.397
and you don't have to leave.

03:23.431 --> 03:25.032
No. Stay.

03:25.067 --> 03:27.284
J and K love having you here.

03:27.335 --> 03:29.336
And besides, it's better than
you being by yourself over there.

03:29.371 --> 03:32.223
Okay, then I'll talk to my mom

03:32.257 --> 03:33.974
and tell her to move back in

03:34.009 --> 03:36.010
and that way nobody has to go anywhere.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.299
Daphne, it's okay.

03:37.334 --> 03:39.235
You don't have to fix this.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.140
It's just until Angelo gets back.

03:44.174 --> 03:46.042
I'm starting my new job at Maui, Kansas.

03:46.076 --> 03:48.944
You should totally check it out.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.012
I've been there.

03:50.046 --> 03:51.814
My mom used to take me.

03:51.848 --> 03:53.916
Oh, cool. Isn't it awesome?

03:55.985 --> 03:57.119
All right.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.788
I think that's it.

03:58.822 --> 03:59.889
House is all yours.

What?

04:26.783 --> 04:27.983
I thought they were sure they had her?

04:28.001 --> 04:29.651
So I'm in Atlanta for nothing?

04:34.841 --> 04:36.825
Well, I guess I'm going to Virginia.

04:36.843 --> 04:40.763
I want to be there when we find
out if they have my daughter.

04:40.797 --> 04:42.098
Why don't you tell me
what I'm supposed to do

04:42.132 --> 04:45.000

04:45.018 --> 04:47.670
Look, if you guys can't fix it,

04:47.704 --> 04:50.005
I'm gonna have to use
another print shop, okay?

04:50.040 --> 04:52.675
Yeah. Get back to me.

<i>Why isn't the line moving?</i>

04:56.913 --> 04:58.731
I don't know.

04:58.782 --> 05:01.617
The Ellsworth dealership hasn't
been billed since March, dad.

05:01.651 --> 05:02.952
That's why they haven't paid.

05:02.986 --> 05:04.620
Oh. Okay.

Hey, Glen. Where's Travis?

Now I gotta close till I
get that guy to come fix it.

Here for the best car wash in town?

05:43.693 --> 05:44.827
Got her done yesterday.

05:44.861 --> 05:46.829
Good thing too. Jeez, look at this line.

05:46.863 --> 05:49.064
Yeah, I know. My manager
quit all of a sudden,

05:49.082 --> 05:52.735
I got equipment problems, blah blah blah.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.703
Is that why we didn't see you at
the Caucus breakfast this morning?

05:54.737 --> 05:58.624
Oh, you know, with my manager quitting...

05:58.675 --> 05:59.942
I get it.

05:59.976 --> 06:01.944
Look, we all have a day job, right?

06:01.978 --> 06:03.946
But the business of the state can't wait.

06:03.980 --> 06:05.648
Sure, of course.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.016
Be great to have your voice, John.

06:07.050 --> 06:08.884
- Yeah yeah.
- All right.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.853
Next breakfast is Tuesday.

06:10.887 --> 06:12.755
- Tuesday. All right.
- Yeah. I'll see you there?

06:12.789 --> 06:13.756
- Yes, sir.
- Be well.

06:13.790 --> 06:14.940
Yeah.

06:18.094 --> 06:20.779
Very good. Return. Good.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.897
<i>Good. Good good good.</i>

06:21.931 --> 06:22.948

06:22.983 --> 06:23.983
<i>Watch it all the way to the rack.</i>

06:24.034 --> 06:26.068
Very nice. Good. Here we go.

06:27.704 --> 06:29.822
- That was yours.
- I thought it was yours.

06:29.873 --> 06:32.941
- No.
- You gotta know your partner's moves.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.044
Focus.

06:35.078 --> 06:36.979
Focus.

06:37.013 --> 06:38.013
Great.

06:43.053 --> 06:44.820
All right. Here we go.

06:44.854 --> 06:46.005
On your toes.

06:46.056 --> 06:47.973
<i>Now get out in front. Very good.</i>

06:48.008 --> 06:50.676
<i>Way to attack. Strong. Here we go.</i>

06:55.148 --> 06:57.900
You're almost in the alley. Move in.

06:59.969 --> 07:01.971
Good. All right. Here we go.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.023
<i>Watch it. Good.</i>

07:05.692 --> 07:06.808
Very nice.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.696
Whoa!

07:10.747 --> 07:12.715
You're supposed to duck, remember?

07:12.749 --> 07:14.950
Well, I didn't think you were
gonna try to take my head off.

07:14.984 --> 07:16.702
You guys are really off today.

07:16.753 --> 07:19.622
Our time is up. But for next time,

07:19.656 --> 07:21.857
work on court communication.

07:21.891 --> 07:23.842
Partners who are in sync

07:23.877 --> 07:25.628
are partners who win.

07:25.662 --> 07:26.762
Yeah?

07:31.668 --> 07:33.636
What's going on?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.971
You've been off in space all morning.

07:36.005 --> 07:37.640
Kathryn.

07:37.674 --> 07:40.676
Hey, Shauna. Hey, Lisa.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.061
Hi, Mrs. Kennish.

07:42.112 --> 07:44.697
Oh, you guys,

07:44.731 --> 07:46.815
this is my daughter, Daphne.

07:46.850 --> 07:48.117
Oh right. Hi.

07:48.151 --> 07:50.786
Daphne, this is Shauna.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.755
And this is Lisa.

07:52.789 --> 07:53.989
Nice to meet you guys.

07:54.023 --> 07:56.742
You two should play the
mother-daughter tournament.

07:58.662 --> 08:00.963
I don't know. I think that it's a bit much

08:00.997 --> 08:02.631
for us right now.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.800
<i>- I'm ready, ladies.
- Both: Coming.</i>

08:04.834 --> 08:06.535
Nice to see you two.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.537
<i>- Hi, Gustavo.
- Hey. How are you?</i>

08:08.571 --> 08:09.972
<i>Great. Okay. Here we go. Ready position.</i>

08:10.006 --> 08:11.673
<i>Now get out in front.</i>

08:11.691 --> 08:12.841
<i>Okay, good.</i>

08:12.876 --> 08:14.827
<i>Uh-Huh. I'm ready. Very nice.</i>

08:14.861 --> 08:16.495
<i>- Nice, honey.
- Very nice.</i>

08:16.546 --> 08:17.579
<i>Watch the ball all the way to the racket.</i>

08:17.614 --> 08:18.881
<i>That's it. Yeah!</i>

08:18.915 --> 08:20.749
<i>(Ska music playing)</i>

08:28.458 --> 08:29.691
<i>* thought we'd settle down *</i>

08:29.709 --> 08:32.544
<i>* take everything head on. *</i>

08:32.595 --> 08:34.663
And as you can see, even
the most skilled players

08:34.681 --> 08:35.664
don't always win.

08:35.682 --> 08:37.666
You should have had that last one.

08:38.702 --> 08:40.785
So the question, Bay, is really this.

08:40.820 --> 08:43.539
Who here woke up this morning and thought

08:43.573 --> 08:45.290
"I'm gonna go to Maui, Kansas

08:45.342 --> 08:47.343
and play some skee ball"?

08:47.377 --> 08:48.610
No one. They come,

08:48.645 --> 08:50.545
they get fluorescent braids in their hair,

08:50.563 --> 08:52.231
eat a pineapple freezee

08:52.282 --> 08:54.483
and scream their heads off on the rip curl.

08:54.517 --> 08:57.352
But do you want to know my
favorite part of this job?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.321
The games?

08:59.356 --> 09:00.456
Yes.

09:00.490 --> 09:03.158
And why are the games my favorite?

09:03.193 --> 09:04.560
Because they make money?

09:04.594 --> 09:06.528
Nope. It's not about the money.

09:06.563 --> 09:09.398
It is about something better.

09:09.432 --> 09:11.066
Power.

09:12.402 --> 09:15.237
Do you know what we call this?

09:15.271 --> 09:17.172
Something tells me I
shouldn't say "microphone."

09:17.207 --> 09:18.340
Mm.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.342
This would be the talking stick.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.444
Whoever holds the talking stick

09:22.479 --> 09:24.363
wields the power to overcome

09:24.414 --> 09:27.116
one of the greatest obstacles known to man.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.085
- Indifference.
- Not where I was going.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.253
They don't care.

09:31.287 --> 09:33.088
You will make them care.

09:33.123 --> 09:35.057
But how, Mac? How do I do that?

09:35.091 --> 09:37.292
By offering something far greater

09:37.327 --> 09:39.061
than any mere prize.

09:39.095 --> 09:41.196
<i>We are offering an experience.</i>

09:41.214 --> 09:43.999
Primal fear. Ecstatic victory.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.101
The ancient chariot races of Rome!

09:46.136 --> 09:47.269
<i>(Clinks)</i>

09:47.303 --> 09:48.937
You're seriously good
with the talking stick.

09:48.972 --> 09:50.038
You will be too.

09:50.073 --> 09:52.107
Okay, I gotta get to the penny drop.

09:52.142 --> 09:53.909
Mary Beth can take it from here.

09:53.943 --> 09:55.844
Got it, chief. Aloha.

09:57.046 --> 09:58.180
Ha.

09:58.214 --> 10:01.116
- That dude's intense.
- Yeah.

10:01.151 --> 10:02.151
You're gonna have a lot of fun.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.819
Games are the best.

10:05.705 --> 10:06.855
Here you go.

10:11.761 --> 10:12.861
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

10:12.896 --> 10:15.798
Great. I was just finishing up this budget.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.002
I hadn't saved that yet.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.571
Close your eyes.

10:22.605 --> 10:23.839
Okay.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.511
All right.

10:29.545 --> 10:30.679
Open your mouth.

10:33.516 --> 10:35.484
- (Chuckles)
- Mmm.

10:35.518 --> 10:36.652
That's really good.

10:36.686 --> 10:38.921
It's devil's food with raspberry filling.

10:38.955 --> 10:40.789
- Devil's food.
- Mm-hmm.

10:40.824 --> 10:42.524
What would Reverend Steve say?

10:42.559 --> 10:46.395
You are just never gonna get
sick of those jokes, are you?

10:46.429 --> 10:47.496
Nope.

10:47.530 --> 10:49.564
All right. So...

10:49.582 --> 10:50.699
budget?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.417
So.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.735
Flowers, photographers,

10:53.770 --> 10:55.671
very expensive.

10:57.474 --> 10:58.557
How do we not have enough?

10:58.608 --> 10:59.575
Nope. No no.

10:59.609 --> 11:03.212
Do not touch the laptop of doom.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.446
I will take care of it myself.

11:04.481 --> 11:06.648
This doesn't have to be
just your problem, you know.

11:06.683 --> 11:08.317
I'll figure it out.

11:08.351 --> 11:11.453
You and I, we will talk about cake,

11:11.488 --> 11:13.489
and about decorations,

11:13.523 --> 11:15.324
and all the fun stuff.

11:19.379 --> 11:22.080
<i>* to the sky *</i>

11:22.131 --> 11:24.082
<i>* we can fly together *</i>

11:24.133 --> 11:25.367
<i>* past the moon *</i>

11:25.385 --> 11:27.302
<i>* almost there. *</i>

11:27.337 --> 11:30.506
You, sir! With the sandals and the socks.

11:30.540 --> 11:33.208
You have inner frustrations.
You should get up here

11:33.243 --> 11:34.409
and un-frustrate them.

11:38.147 --> 11:40.332
Okay, I'm gonna be honest.
This is my first day.

11:40.383 --> 11:42.150
I just need a customer.

11:42.185 --> 11:44.152
Seriously. One person.

11:44.187 --> 11:45.220
Please?

11:45.255 --> 11:47.289
How about a little more enthusiasm?

11:47.323 --> 11:49.157
Oh, you should have
been here two hours ago.

11:49.192 --> 11:50.242
I was very committed.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.094
I'll play.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.213
You know, that's okay.

11:54.264 --> 11:56.215
My shift's almost over anyway.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.802
I'm sorry about the other day.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.938
The text thing.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.957
Don't worry about it.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.910
Those guys were idiots.

12:07.944 --> 12:09.177
But I shouldn't have let them get to me.

12:09.212 --> 12:14.700
Yeah, you did kind of go Jekyll
and Hyde there for a second.

12:14.734 --> 12:15.984
Hey.

12:16.018 --> 12:17.686
I'm almost done.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.054
Do you mind taking this
to the office for me?

12:19.088 --> 12:20.689
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

12:20.723 --> 12:22.657
Mary Beth, this is Bay.

12:22.675 --> 12:23.658
We already met.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.627
Mary Beth's been initiating me

12:25.662 --> 12:27.729
into the rites and rituals of Maui, Kansas.

12:27.764 --> 12:29.631
You're off to a great start.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.932
Tomorrow it's gonna go even better.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.701
Mahalo.

12:34.938 --> 12:36.588
So that's your friend who works here.

12:36.639 --> 12:38.873
Yeah. She's cool.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.543
So how about you and I

12:41.561 --> 12:42.711
hang out again sometime

12:42.729 --> 12:44.679
like out in the real world?

12:44.731 --> 12:46.615
I'd love to.

12:46.649 --> 12:49.501
Maybe like get some tacos or something.

12:49.535 --> 12:51.803
We can go ogle the poor
people of East Riverside.

12:51.838 --> 12:55.457
You are never gonna let
me live that down, are you?

12:55.491 --> 12:56.425
Mm-hmm.

12:56.459 --> 12:57.693
What time are you off tomorrow?

12:57.727 --> 12:59.595
- 4:00.
- All right. Well, then I'll see you then.

12:59.629 --> 13:02.497
And I promise no Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde this time.

13:02.532 --> 13:04.499
All right.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.669
I didn't know you knew Ty.

13:07.687 --> 13:12.341
Well, we almost kind of grew up together.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.276
It's a long story.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.644
Did I hear you guys saying

13:15.662 --> 13:16.712
you were gonna do something tomorrow?

13:16.746 --> 13:18.480
Yeah.

13:18.514 --> 13:20.482
I'm sorry. It's none of my business.

13:20.516 --> 13:22.551
It's just... that's good.

13:22.585 --> 13:24.269
That's a good sign.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.223
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:38.977 --> 13:39.604
Wait a minute,

13:38.978 --> 13:41.980
<i>you said "yes" without talking to me first?</i>

13:42.015 --> 13:43.749
And what would you have said?

13:43.783 --> 13:45.717
"I'm sorry, Bay, you can't spend time

13:45.752 --> 13:47.019
with your biological mother"?

13:47.053 --> 13:49.605
You can't go live with a fresh out of rehab

13:49.639 --> 13:50.856
alcoholic basket case.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.608
And she would have done it anyway.

13:52.642 --> 13:55.594
And given you the cold
shoulder for like a year.

13:55.628 --> 13:57.629
Besides, Regina is not a basket case.

13:59.432 --> 14:00.466
Honey,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.401
it's only fair.

14:02.435 --> 14:04.703
We had Daphne for weeks.

14:04.737 --> 14:06.705
She's still here and Regina's back.

14:06.739 --> 14:09.608
What if Bay decides she wants
to move in with Regina for good?

14:09.642 --> 14:10.776
She won't.

14:10.810 --> 14:12.544
Don't be so sure.

14:12.579 --> 14:14.346
We are talking about the girl

14:14.380 --> 14:16.348
who enrolled in a school for the deaf

14:16.382 --> 14:17.516
and stayed there.

14:17.550 --> 14:20.569
What happened to your rule
about not bringing work to bed?

14:20.603 --> 14:23.555
That died the minute I
took on two full-time jobs.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.407
You need a new manager.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.592
Mm-hmm.

14:28.261 --> 14:29.294
Honey.

14:29.329 --> 14:31.363
I'm so happy to see you.

14:31.397 --> 14:32.531
Come on in.

14:32.565 --> 14:34.500
Come come.

14:34.534 --> 14:37.136
- When does Angelo...
- Is it muggy out?

14:37.170 --> 14:39.304
- Is Bay at...
- I don't know yet.

14:39.339 --> 14:40.405
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

14:40.440 --> 14:41.540
You go.

14:41.574 --> 14:44.343
Do you have lunch plans?

14:44.377 --> 14:45.410
Yes.

14:45.445 --> 14:47.412
With a can of tuna.

14:47.447 --> 14:48.547
Want to make me a better offer?

14:48.581 --> 14:51.283
- Well, I was thinking...
- I accept.

14:51.317 --> 14:52.451
(Both chuckle)

14:52.485 --> 14:55.154
Sit down and I'll go change my clothes.

14:59.175 --> 15:01.093
Oh. Sorry.

15:01.127 --> 15:04.229
Without you or grandma, I
go back to my native ways.

15:04.264 --> 15:06.999
(Chuckles) I'll help you clean up.

15:07.033 --> 15:08.200
Oh no no no no no.

15:08.234 --> 15:10.135
You are a guest.

15:10.170 --> 15:13.105
Give me five minutes and we'll go.

15:15.008 --> 15:15.974
Okay.

15:30.924 --> 15:33.058
<i>(Car door opens, closes)</i>

15:35.194 --> 15:36.695
Good.

15:36.713 --> 15:38.864
Looks like things are back to normal.

15:40.033 --> 15:42.684
That guy, he came this morning?

15:42.717 --> 15:48.653
__

15:48.775 --> 15:50.709
What do you mean you fixed it? How?

15:50.752 --> 15:55.450
__

15:55.615 --> 15:58.450
(Chuckles) That's fantastic.

15:58.484 --> 16:00.769
You saved me a chunk of change.

16:00.820 --> 16:01.904
Thank you.

16:04.205 --> 16:07.626
- __
- Sure.

16:15.766 --> 16:19.821
__

16:22.642 --> 16:24.543
I'm happy that you showed me this

16:24.577 --> 16:26.445
<i>- 'cause I wanna talk...
- (Cellphone dings)</i>

16:30.450 --> 16:32.417
I... I have to

16:32.452 --> 16:34.219
call the office,

16:34.254 --> 16:36.688
but I want to talk to you about that.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.134
Okay?

16:38.168 --> 16:39.452
All right. Thank you.

16:50.147 --> 16:51.480
Hi. I'm looking at her.

16:51.515 --> 16:54.984
<i>They have my baby.</i>

16:55.018 --> 16:57.153
<i>No. I haven't said a word.</i>

16:57.187 --> 16:59.388
But I'm telling you, it's her.

17:01.225 --> 17:03.259
Please do whatever you need to do

17:03.293 --> 17:04.894
so I can take her home.

17:04.928 --> 17:06.229
Please.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.961
Aloha.

17:21.994 --> 17:23.912
I'm over at Loco Nuts today.

17:23.931 --> 17:25.114
How'd the morning go?

17:25.147 --> 17:26.949
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

17:26.983 --> 17:29.085
You wouldn't happen to have
any napkins or something?

17:29.119 --> 17:30.719
Yeah.

17:30.737 --> 17:32.188
You should get some of these.

17:32.222 --> 17:33.189
And some rubber gloves.

17:35.058 --> 17:36.959
Pretty much what you imagine.

17:36.994 --> 17:39.729
(Groans)

17:39.763 --> 17:41.998
So how do you know Ty?

17:42.032 --> 17:44.967
He and my brother were stationed
in the same unit in Kabul.

17:45.002 --> 17:46.935
Oh.

17:46.954 --> 17:49.605
What was it like over there?
I keep trying to ask Ty,

17:49.640 --> 17:50.806
but I'm never sure if it's okay.

17:50.841 --> 17:52.792
Yeah, they don't talk much about it.

17:52.843 --> 17:54.510
I could never get much out of Justin.

17:54.544 --> 17:55.678
- That's your brother?
- Yeah.

17:55.712 --> 17:56.679
Is he still over there?

17:56.713 --> 17:58.581
No no. He came home last spring.

17:58.615 --> 18:00.850
But he had a hard time
and he didn't make it.

18:00.884 --> 18:02.652
What do you mean?

18:04.855 --> 18:05.788
He killed himself.

18:07.791 --> 18:09.625
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

18:09.660 --> 18:12.461
I go to this support group with my mom.

18:12.496 --> 18:14.764
I guess a lot of guys have
a hard time coming back.

18:14.798 --> 18:17.400
I'm so sorry.

18:17.434 --> 18:18.668
Thanks.

18:18.735 --> 18:21.504
But that's why Ty kind of looks out for me.

18:21.538 --> 18:23.372
He's a really good guy.

18:24.474 --> 18:26.742
You guys have fun tonight.

18:36.817 --> 18:38.868
Oh, hey.

18:38.903 --> 18:41.871
I thought we were gonna go swimming.

18:41.906 --> 18:44.007
Oh, I stopped by Angelo's

18:44.041 --> 18:46.009
and had lunch with my mom.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.010
That's nice.

18:47.044 --> 18:48.912
- (Chuckles)
- (Exhales)

18:48.946 --> 18:49.979
What are you doing?

18:50.014 --> 18:52.816
Oh! I'm just looking
at these catering menus.

18:52.850 --> 18:55.585
What do you think?

18:55.619 --> 18:59.722
Bacon wrapped asparagus too
fancy for a barbeque side dish?

18:59.757 --> 19:02.492
I'd probably just stick to the classics.

19:02.526 --> 19:05.461
Corn on the cob, baked beans.

19:05.496 --> 19:07.530
Yeah. You're right.

19:07.565 --> 19:08.598
Then you can go...

19:08.632 --> 19:09.866
Both: Fancy for dessert.

19:09.900 --> 19:12.535
(Chuckles)

19:12.570 --> 19:14.404
Oh! Oh.

19:14.438 --> 19:16.472
What do you think about this?

19:16.507 --> 19:18.374
<i>- That's cute.
- Yeah?</i>

19:18.409 --> 19:22.612
So you wouldn't mind if I got you one?

19:22.646 --> 19:24.714
Oh no. I'm fine in shorts.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.617
Well, this is for something special.

19:27.651 --> 19:31.688
I signed us up for the
mother-daughter tournament at the club.

19:31.722 --> 19:34.490
We're not ready for that.

19:34.525 --> 19:38.228
We just had a bad day.

19:38.262 --> 19:40.697
Our first match is with Lisa and Shauna.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.532
They're really good.

19:42.566 --> 19:45.368
Lisa's good. Shauna chokes.

19:45.402 --> 19:46.402
We can beat them.

19:46.437 --> 19:48.404
Kathryn...

19:48.439 --> 19:49.572
We just have to communicate better.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.241
We can work on that.

19:51.275 --> 19:53.343
It'll be fun.

19:53.377 --> 19:55.445
Honey,

19:55.479 --> 19:57.180
don't worry.

19:57.214 --> 19:58.381
And we're gonna look great.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.192
Okay, so we have a
misogynistic horror film,

20:09.226 --> 20:12.145
some rom com that's
gonna make hate ourselves,

20:12.179 --> 20:14.163
or a brain-dead comedy.

20:14.198 --> 20:17.200
I'm up for the comedy.

20:17.234 --> 20:18.968
Okay.

20:24.141 --> 20:25.408
Oh man.

20:25.442 --> 20:26.910
Been a while?

20:26.944 --> 20:28.077
Mm.

20:28.112 --> 20:30.213
I've just had way too
much mac and cheese lately.

20:30.247 --> 20:33.049
What's that like living on an army base?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.851
I just picture it's like summer camp

20:34.885 --> 20:36.119
but everybody's yelling
at you all the time.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.021
It's not that bad.

20:38.055 --> 20:40.990
Fort Powell's pretty nice, actually.

20:41.025 --> 20:43.159
But it's kind of like
living at work, you know?

20:43.193 --> 20:45.795
Which for me would be

20:45.829 --> 20:47.764
sleeping in a gigantic tiki head.

20:47.798 --> 20:49.799
(Chuckles)

20:51.101 --> 20:53.836
It's just until they move
me somewhere else anyway.

20:53.871 --> 20:55.838
So who knows what's next?

20:58.676 --> 21:00.777
Uh, so Mary Beth was
filling me in a little bit

21:00.811 --> 21:03.846
on your whole overseas thing.

21:03.881 --> 21:05.648
Yeah?

21:05.683 --> 21:06.950
Yeah, I mean, what she knew.

21:06.984 --> 21:09.585
Which isn't much.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.522
<i>She told me about Justin.</i>

21:15.726 --> 21:16.960
Do you know what happened?

21:16.994 --> 21:19.629
I mean, he made it home and then...

21:23.667 --> 21:26.436
I don't know.

21:27.805 --> 21:30.573
Um, he just couldn't
deal I guess, you know?

21:32.476 --> 21:33.509
I'm gonna get some more napkins.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.711
We should pick a movie, okay?

21:42.686 --> 21:44.320
Hey, dad. You have a second?

21:44.355 --> 21:45.388
<i>Yeah.</i>

21:47.324 --> 21:48.374
You sure about that?

21:48.425 --> 21:49.625
(Chuckles)

21:49.677 --> 21:51.544
Yeah, you know, I'm just
trying to make sense of this

21:51.595 --> 21:53.629
homestead tax relief bill.

21:53.647 --> 21:55.331
Ooh.

21:55.366 --> 21:57.333
Well, I can't help you with that,

21:57.368 --> 21:59.435
but I can make your life
easier in another way.

21:59.470 --> 22:01.304
And how much is that gonna cost me?

22:01.338 --> 22:03.539
You mean, how much is it going to save you?

22:03.574 --> 22:05.425
You need a new manager for the car wash.

22:05.476 --> 22:06.576
I need a higher paying job.

22:06.610 --> 22:09.078
Hire me as your manager.

22:09.113 --> 22:11.247
We solve both of our problems.

22:11.281 --> 22:13.149
Are you serious?

22:13.183 --> 22:15.318
Check this out.

22:15.352 --> 22:17.220
Now if you cut certain fixed costs

22:17.254 --> 22:20.023
and raise your marketing
budget by just five percent,

22:20.057 --> 22:21.391
you could increase your bottom line revenue

22:21.425 --> 22:23.326
- anywhere from like...
- Whoa whoa whoa.

22:23.360 --> 22:26.095
So are you telling me you put
all this together yourself?

22:26.130 --> 22:27.397
Yeah.

22:27.431 --> 22:30.266
It's just dollars and cents.
It's not particle physics.

22:30.300 --> 22:34.003
Toby, you understand
manager is a full-time job.

22:34.038 --> 22:35.204
I'm getting married now.

22:35.239 --> 22:38.074
Ah. Well,

22:38.108 --> 22:40.076
you know, your mother
and I are more than happy

22:40.110 --> 22:41.277
to pitch in and help pay for this thing.

22:41.311 --> 22:43.179
I know. And I appreciate that.

22:43.213 --> 22:45.948
But Nikki is not wild about
taking money from you guys,

22:45.983 --> 22:47.083
and honestly, neither am I.

22:47.117 --> 22:49.152
Not if I can work for it.

22:49.186 --> 22:51.954
You don't have to say yes tonight.

22:51.989 --> 22:54.723
But let me at least show
you some of my ideas,

22:54.742 --> 22:56.859
and you can think about it.

23:01.698 --> 23:03.766
<i>Bay: Is it possible to
get herpes from a movie?</i>

23:03.801 --> 23:05.134
'Cause they should have been giving out

23:05.169 --> 23:07.837
brain condoms in the lobby.

23:11.975 --> 23:15.912
Stop sign's not gonna turn green.

23:15.946 --> 23:17.580
Are you okay?

23:17.614 --> 23:19.882
Hmm?

23:19.917 --> 23:21.818
Yeah.

23:21.852 --> 23:24.854
'Cause you haven't really said much.

23:28.525 --> 23:30.793
Um, I just...

23:30.828 --> 23:33.463
I don't really feel like talking right now.

23:33.497 --> 23:34.464
Is that okay?

23:34.498 --> 23:35.731
Yeah.

23:35.766 --> 23:36.732
Yeah. Of course.

23:40.437 --> 23:41.504
Hey, you're cold.

23:41.538 --> 23:43.372
- Here.
- I'm fine.

23:43.407 --> 23:44.373
No, it's okay.

23:47.644 --> 23:48.611
What's this?

23:51.481 --> 23:52.715
Yeah, that.

23:52.749 --> 23:55.518
When did you get this?

23:58.255 --> 23:59.555
There was a...

23:59.590 --> 24:01.524
this tattoo guy in Kabul

24:01.558 --> 24:03.643
and a lot of the guys went, so.

24:06.430 --> 24:07.597
It's not what it looks like.

24:07.631 --> 24:09.398
Looks a lot like my poster.

24:18.442 --> 24:20.076
I'm not freaking out or anything.

24:20.110 --> 24:23.179
I'm just... surprised.

24:27.518 --> 24:29.185
So when exactly did...

24:29.253 --> 24:30.403
<i>(Car horn honks)</i>

24:30.437 --> 24:33.055
Yes. Okay.

24:33.090 --> 24:34.090
I'm going.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.390
On the one hand there's Travis

24:48.424 --> 24:51.977
who I have to say has really
stepped up and proven himself.

24:52.011 --> 24:54.946
And on the other hand, there's Toby.

24:54.997 --> 24:56.281
Who's your son.

24:56.332 --> 24:58.083
I'm well aware of that fact.

24:58.117 --> 25:00.919
You know, I'm just thinking

25:00.953 --> 25:04.373
will Travis ever have
another opportunity like this?

25:07.176 --> 25:08.977
Are you gonna hire an interpreter?

25:09.011 --> 25:10.145
I mean, I hate to bring it up,

25:10.179 --> 25:11.947
but it is a real question.

25:11.981 --> 25:13.115
You think I have to?

25:13.149 --> 25:15.050
He's not as oral as Daphne.

25:15.084 --> 25:16.818
I mean, how is he gonna interact

25:16.853 --> 25:19.137
with the dealership reps,
the vendors, the crew.

25:19.188 --> 25:21.123
He's done pretty good so far.

25:21.157 --> 25:24.760
Honey, he still has one
more year of school left.

25:24.794 --> 25:26.962
I mean, what, is he gonna quit school

25:26.996 --> 25:28.997
come fall just to keep this job?

25:29.031 --> 25:32.067
Sounds to me like you think
Toby's the man for the job.

25:32.101 --> 25:33.968
I don't know. I'm just
weighing the pros and cons

25:33.986 --> 25:35.136
of each young man.

25:35.154 --> 25:37.906
I mean, obviously Toby could handle it.

25:37.940 --> 25:40.108
Is this really what we want for Toby?

25:40.143 --> 25:41.109
To manage a car wash?

25:41.144 --> 25:42.878
It's not forever.

25:42.912 --> 25:45.614
Famous last words.

25:45.648 --> 25:47.716
You know what I'm thinking?

25:47.750 --> 25:49.551
If I give Travis the job,

25:49.585 --> 25:50.886
I might be doing Toby a favor.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.039
Isn't that what your
father tried to do to you?

25:55.143 --> 25:57.241
<i>Impose his will on you for your own good?</i>

25:57.377 --> 25:59.008
I am not my father.

26:00.165 --> 26:03.161
And job or no job, I will
always be in Toby's corner.

26:04.862 --> 26:05.925
What about Travis?

26:06.956 --> 26:08.437
Who does he have in his corner?

26:20.586 --> 26:24.205
(sighs) Looks like I'm getting
over the whole early morning thing.

26:26.236 --> 26:27.810
I heard you coming late last night?

26:27.811 --> 26:29.595
Uh yeah, I went out after work.

26:29.596 --> 26:31.546
Yeah, I got the text. Work friends?

26:31.547 --> 26:33.889
No, uh... Ty, actually.

26:36.690 --> 26:38.215
Ty... Mendoza?

26:39.316 --> 26:40.725
- Wait, he's back?
- Yep.

26:42.194 --> 26:44.112
Is he okay? Is he in one piece?

26:44.146 --> 26:45.480
Yeah.

26:47.983 --> 26:49.017
But... ?

26:49.034 --> 26:52.020
I found out he had this friend

26:52.054 --> 26:54.088
who made it back with him,

26:54.123 --> 26:55.923
and then he killed himself.

26:55.958 --> 26:57.025
<i>Which is awful,</i>

26:57.059 --> 26:59.961
and I can't stop thinking about it.

27:01.263 --> 27:03.097
And how's Ty?

27:04.900 --> 27:06.200
I don't know.

27:06.235 --> 27:08.202
He kind of overreacted

27:08.237 --> 27:10.038
to this thing that happened the other day

27:10.072 --> 27:11.939
and every time I try to talk to him

27:11.974 --> 27:15.143
about anything beyond "what
movie do you want to see?"

27:15.177 --> 27:17.078
He just shuts down.

27:17.168 --> 27:20.070
Maybe he doesn't want to lay it on you.

27:20.105 --> 27:22.039
He got this tattoo.

27:22.073 --> 27:23.307
It's of my artwork.

27:23.341 --> 27:25.042
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:25.076 --> 27:27.177
So now I'm like half worried about him

27:27.212 --> 27:29.913
and then I'm half freaked out
that he's like obsessed with me.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.949
Does he seem obsessed?

27:31.983 --> 27:33.016
No.

27:33.051 --> 27:35.853
But I broke up with him

27:35.887 --> 27:38.956
on the phone in the middle of
whatever he was going through.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.124
<i>(Cellphone rings)</i>

27:42.861 --> 27:43.994
It's Angelo.

27:44.028 --> 27:44.995
Go ahead. Take it.

27:45.029 --> 27:46.780
One second.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.064
<i>(Ringing continues)</i>

27:48.083 --> 27:49.867
Hey.

27:49.901 --> 27:51.735
How's Atlanta?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.070
<i>Angelo: Virginia, actually.</i>

27:53.104 --> 27:54.838
<i>I thought the baby was in Atlanta?</i>

27:54.873 --> 27:56.006
Wasn't her.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.708
She's with a different family.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.710
I saw her yesterday.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.044
How did it go?

28:01.079 --> 28:02.780
<i>I was not allowed to talk to them.</i>

28:02.814 --> 28:04.882
I have to wait for all these lawyers

28:04.916 --> 28:06.683
and adoption agencies.

28:06.718 --> 28:10.020
And um...

28:10.054 --> 28:11.054
how did you do it?

28:11.089 --> 28:12.990
Do what?

28:13.024 --> 28:15.092
<i>That day when you saw Bay.</i>

28:18.730 --> 28:21.632
How did you keep yourself from
grabbing her right then and there

28:21.666 --> 28:22.766
and take her home?

28:26.671 --> 28:27.805
Sometimes I wish I had.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.047
(Gasps)

28:37.081 --> 28:40.050
Want to tell me why
you're following my family?

28:43.688 --> 28:45.022
<i>(Pop music playing)</i>

28:46.825 --> 28:48.725
<i>* we be shutting down these cats *</i>

28:48.760 --> 28:50.744
<i>* every time we get a chance *</i>

28:50.795 --> 28:51.962
<i>* we do this so easy *</i>

28:51.996 --> 28:53.831
<i>* y'all sit there looking cheesy *</i>

28:53.865 --> 28:55.499
<i>* and every time we come around *</i>

28:55.533 --> 28:57.501
<i>* y'all wonder who I be *</i>

28:57.519 --> 28:58.852
<i>* ooh * (Groans)</i>

28:58.887 --> 29:00.471
<i>* we're unstoppable *</i>

29:00.505 --> 29:01.772
40-15.

29:01.806 --> 29:03.724
<i>- Match point.
- * we're unstoppable. *</i>

29:18.840 --> 29:19.807
Oh!

29:21.626 --> 29:23.460
Game.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.529
<i>First set miner and
miner. Six games to one.</i>

29:25.563 --> 29:28.482
<i>- Thanks, baby.
- (Chuckling)</i>

29:28.533 --> 29:29.600
- Good one.
- Good shot.

29:29.634 --> 29:31.568
I told you she was going down the middle.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.537
Did you not see the sign?

29:33.571 --> 29:34.788
I thought she was going wide.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.540
You should have had that one.

29:39.544 --> 29:40.677
Look,

29:40.712 --> 29:43.480
I know it's hard without Regina.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.482
But I'd appreciate it

29:45.517 --> 29:47.351
if you didn't take it out on me.

29:47.385 --> 29:49.319
She left because of you.

29:49.353 --> 29:52.522
Regina left on her own.

29:52.540 --> 29:55.726
I can't make that woman do anything.

29:57.378 --> 29:58.629
(Exhales)

29:58.663 --> 30:00.731
Can we just have one minute?

30:00.765 --> 30:03.333
Yeah. Come on.

30:03.368 --> 30:04.634
Look.

30:04.652 --> 30:07.437
I miss Bay.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.357
But I don't blame you.

30:10.408 --> 30:12.342
You shouldn't have signed us up

30:12.377 --> 30:13.694
for a tournament that we're not ready for.

30:13.745 --> 30:15.662
Well, at least I'm trying.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.280
Which is more than you.

30:17.298 --> 30:19.499
A week ago, you'd have been diving

30:19.551 --> 30:20.617
to return those shots

30:20.652 --> 30:24.221
instead of standing there yelling at me.

30:24.255 --> 30:26.223
Take some responsibility.

30:40.243 --> 30:42.227
I'm here to see Tyler Mendoza.

30:42.262 --> 30:43.328
<i>Private, maybe?</i>

30:49.035 --> 30:50.169
(Sighs)

30:54.007 --> 30:54.973
Thank you.

31:04.918 --> 31:07.186
Ty, hey.

31:07.220 --> 31:08.170
Regina.

31:08.204 --> 31:09.171
What are you doing here?

31:09.205 --> 31:10.956
I thought I'd come by.

31:10.990 --> 31:12.925
Welcome you back.

31:14.894 --> 31:16.862
Hiding out here without telling anybody.

31:16.896 --> 31:18.864
Yeah, I was...

31:18.898 --> 31:20.032
I was gonna get around to that.

31:21.768 --> 31:23.769
So I looked up online what to bring you.

31:23.803 --> 31:25.838
It says the number one thing you guys like

31:25.872 --> 31:27.072
are those awful protein bars.

31:27.106 --> 31:28.106
(Chuckles) Thank you.

31:28.141 --> 31:29.908
This is really nice.

31:29.943 --> 31:31.043
You're welcome.

31:33.012 --> 31:36.949
So, this is where you
do your whole army thing.

31:36.983 --> 31:39.751
Whatever that is.

31:39.786 --> 31:41.954
Well, they've got me on motor pool.

31:41.988 --> 31:44.957
So if you ever need somebody
who can fix a Humvee,

31:44.991 --> 31:47.726
- I'm your guy.
- Ahh.

31:47.760 --> 31:48.894
You look good.

31:55.702 --> 31:58.837
Yep. There it is.

31:58.855 --> 31:59.938
You heard about that, huh?

31:59.973 --> 32:02.574
I heard a lot of stuff.

32:02.609 --> 32:04.643
You okay?

32:04.677 --> 32:06.478
I'm fine.

32:06.513 --> 32:08.580
Really. Everybody can just relax.

32:08.615 --> 32:11.450
Well, you got some vasquez women concerned.

32:11.484 --> 32:13.719
You want us to relax, don't shut us out.

32:13.753 --> 32:16.455
Yeah.

32:16.489 --> 32:17.789
Yeah, okay. You're right.

32:17.807 --> 32:19.658
I got it.

32:19.692 --> 32:21.760
But...

32:21.794 --> 32:24.463
you know, not everybody comes back damaged.

32:24.497 --> 32:26.431
Maybe.

32:26.466 --> 32:28.667
But I bet all of you come back changed.

32:32.772 --> 32:34.506
You heard I went to rehab, right?

32:35.708 --> 32:36.842
Bay mentioned something, yeah.

32:36.876 --> 32:38.510
You know how that happened?

32:39.879 --> 32:41.580
Thinking I could handle everything

32:41.614 --> 32:43.682
all by myself.

32:43.716 --> 32:47.753
And I am a lot tougher than you are.

32:53.459 --> 32:56.245
Uh, guys, can we gather around please?

32:58.381 --> 33:01.433
Okay, I got a few things to say.

33:01.467 --> 33:05.571
First of all, I'm really sorry
that I've been away so much.

33:05.605 --> 33:08.540
I know that it's been
hard since we lost Frank.

33:08.575 --> 33:10.509
But...

33:10.543 --> 33:12.277
as of today,

33:12.312 --> 33:13.512
we have a new Frank.

33:13.546 --> 33:15.631
Okay, he's young.

33:15.665 --> 33:17.449
He understands the business.

33:17.483 --> 33:19.384
So I expect each and every one of you

33:19.419 --> 33:21.520
to show him a lot of respect.

33:21.554 --> 33:24.189
Okay?

33:24.223 --> 33:25.257
Toby,

33:25.291 --> 33:26.525
congratulations.

33:26.559 --> 33:28.143
<i>(Applause)</i>

33:29.495 --> 33:31.163
Thanks, guys.

33:31.197 --> 33:32.331
Thanks.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.234
Well, let's get back to work.

33:36.269 --> 33:37.586
You heard the man. Back to work.

33:39.357 --> 33:41.074
Hey hey.

33:41.109 --> 33:43.076
Um...

33:43.111 --> 33:44.494
look, I'm really sorry.

33:44.529 --> 33:47.447
It was a tough decision for me.

33:47.465 --> 33:50.083
But with you going back to school...

33:50.716 --> 33:52.984
__

34:10.938 --> 34:12.072
Hey.

34:12.106 --> 34:13.139
How were the games?

34:13.174 --> 34:15.976
Well, I managed successfully

34:16.010 --> 34:18.110
to part some people away from their money.

34:18.146 --> 34:19.179
So yay for me.

34:21.916 --> 34:22.916
Glazed almond?

34:22.951 --> 34:24.985
Oh, no thanks.

34:26.888 --> 34:28.188
Err... okay.

34:32.060 --> 34:34.328
You don't have to look at me like that.

34:34.362 --> 34:35.929
Like what?

34:37.031 --> 34:38.831
Like I'm gonna go off or something.

34:42.036 --> 34:44.972
Well, you have been kind
of unpredictable lately.

34:45.005 --> 34:47.074
I know.

34:47.108 --> 34:49.009
I'm working on it.

34:52.112 --> 34:55.716
Well, I'm gonna stop
asking prying questions

34:55.750 --> 34:56.817
if that helps.

34:56.851 --> 34:59.720
You can ask.

34:59.754 --> 35:02.789
I may not always have an answer for you.

35:05.059 --> 35:06.727
Why did Justin kill himself?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.033
I don't know.

35:15.970 --> 35:17.738
Do you ever feel the same way?

35:17.772 --> 35:19.740
No.

35:24.846 --> 35:26.747
I mean...

35:26.781 --> 35:30.951
we saw some stuff, okay?

35:30.985 --> 35:34.755
But I think it bothered him more than me.

35:39.794 --> 35:41.828
I sometimes think about random things.

35:41.863 --> 35:44.031
Just like...

35:44.065 --> 35:46.667
dead dogs that we would
see lying in the road

35:46.701 --> 35:50.704
or some kid's stuffed rabbit
in the street, you know?

35:56.744 --> 36:00.447
This one time when we were
driving the tank back to base,

36:00.481 --> 36:03.617
we were handing stuff out to the kids.

36:03.651 --> 36:05.452
They would come up to us
and we were just giving them

36:05.486 --> 36:08.488
like soap bubbles or gum. Stuff like that.

36:08.523 --> 36:11.758
And that day I had this soccer ball.

36:11.793 --> 36:15.595
So I'm looking around
for who to give it to,

36:15.630 --> 36:17.397
and all these boys are running up

36:17.432 --> 36:18.565
and they're reaching out for it

36:18.599 --> 36:19.633
saying "me me. Give it to me."

36:21.769 --> 36:24.404
But I see this girl standing there.

36:24.439 --> 36:28.375
And she's just looking at the tank.

36:28.409 --> 36:30.377
It was the one with your poster on it.

36:30.411 --> 36:31.545
And... (Chuckles)

36:31.579 --> 36:33.814
she just, uh... she does the pose.

36:33.848 --> 36:35.615
(Chuckles)

36:35.650 --> 36:37.801
Total badass, right?

36:37.835 --> 36:39.786
<i>So I said "hey."</i>

36:39.821 --> 36:41.421
And I tossed the ball to her.

36:41.456 --> 36:42.622
Nice.

36:44.358 --> 36:45.459
Yeah. And all the boys,

36:45.493 --> 36:47.427
they were trying to take it away from her,

36:47.462 --> 36:49.429
but she hangs onto it.

36:49.464 --> 36:51.565
And the next day

36:51.599 --> 36:53.400
there's this field by the base

36:53.434 --> 36:54.568
where all the kids play,

36:54.602 --> 36:56.403
and she shows up with the soccer ball.

36:56.437 --> 36:58.605
But none of the boys are letting her play.

36:58.639 --> 37:01.374
And we're yelling to them,

37:01.409 --> 37:04.544
"guys, let her play.
You gotta let her play."

37:04.579 --> 37:06.546
Finally they back down

37:06.581 --> 37:10.484
and she starts to play, and she's amazing.

37:10.518 --> 37:12.352
I mean, you should have seen it.

37:12.386 --> 37:13.487
A real hammer girl.

37:13.521 --> 37:15.355
Yeah.

37:19.360 --> 37:22.329
And then...

37:22.363 --> 37:25.298
this guy shows up and...

37:25.333 --> 37:27.467
when he sees her playing,

37:27.502 --> 37:29.136
he like flips out.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.505
<i>And, uh... </i>

37:31.539 --> 37:34.107
he starts screaming at the boys

37:34.142 --> 37:36.276
and he's screaming at us, and he grabs her,

37:36.310 --> 37:37.410
drags her off the field.

37:37.445 --> 37:39.279
What did you do?

37:39.313 --> 37:40.514
We couldn't do anything.

37:40.548 --> 37:42.382
The interpreter said it was her Uncle.

37:42.416 --> 37:44.351
And that makes it okay?

37:44.385 --> 37:46.253
That's just how it is.

37:49.524 --> 37:52.159
<i>What happened to her?</i>

37:55.429 --> 37:57.230
I don't know.

37:57.265 --> 38:00.066
We never saw her again.

38:00.101 --> 38:02.235
I asked around.

38:02.270 --> 38:04.404
This one guy told me I didn't want to know.

38:07.308 --> 38:09.543
Bad stuff happens to girls over there.

38:11.445 --> 38:14.080
Like really bad.

38:14.115 --> 38:16.449
That's when I got the tattoo.

38:16.484 --> 38:19.419
I don't know, I just thought it would

38:19.453 --> 38:23.323
keep her spirit alive or something.

38:32.872 --> 38:34.773
You're back already?

38:34.808 --> 38:37.576
Sorry I didn't call.

38:37.610 --> 38:39.745
<i>Well, I would have picked
you up at the airport.</i>

38:44.834 --> 38:46.719
I'm guessing things didn't go well?

38:46.753 --> 38:48.671
It wasn't her.

38:48.722 --> 38:51.523
I was so sure when I saw her.

38:55.562 --> 38:56.595
(Sighs)

39:01.735 --> 39:03.635
<i>- Where's Bay?
- She's out.</i>

39:03.670 --> 39:06.772
You know obviously we will
go back to the house tonight.

39:06.806 --> 39:08.524
No no no no.

39:08.575 --> 39:09.942
Please stay.

39:13.913 --> 39:15.814
I'd like my family with me.

39:28.928 --> 39:30.696
Hi.

39:30.730 --> 39:32.698
It smells good.

39:34.601 --> 39:35.801
It's your recipe.

39:39.606 --> 39:40.839
Can I help?

39:42.942 --> 39:44.576
Here.

39:48.948 --> 39:51.650
(Chuckles)

39:51.684 --> 39:53.919
Our tennis needs work,

39:53.953 --> 39:56.622
but we're gonna rule at doubles lasagna.

39:56.656 --> 39:58.891
(Chuckles)

39:58.925 --> 40:01.827
We'll get them next time.

40:02.962 --> 40:04.763
Yeah.

40:07.967 --> 40:10.035
How come there's so much stuff left over?

40:10.069 --> 40:14.039
Oh, the recipe makes two pans.

40:14.073 --> 40:15.774
Oh.

40:15.809 --> 40:17.810
We're gonna be eating lasagna for a week.

40:17.844 --> 40:19.945
(Chuckles)

40:21.648 --> 40:24.783
I wonder what Bay and
Regina are eating tonight.

40:26.052 --> 40:27.019
Cereal.

40:28.822 --> 40:30.622
Do you think

40:30.657 --> 40:33.058
that they're ready for some real food?

40:33.092 --> 40:35.627
I'll get the other pan.

40:41.668 --> 40:42.751
Perfect.

40:42.786 --> 40:43.902

40:51.044 --> 40:53.578
(Laughs)

40:53.596 --> 40:54.780
What is this thing you guys are doing?

40:54.814 --> 40:57.716
It's called bachata. It's
from Dominican Republic.

40:57.750 --> 40:58.884
And you have to do it.

40:58.918 --> 41:00.769
I did not inherit the dance gene.

41:00.804 --> 41:02.638
We're all just going to have
to accept that and move on.

41:02.689 --> 41:03.755
You're doing great.

41:03.773 --> 41:04.973
Okay, it's all in the hips.

41:05.024 --> 41:06.792
<i>Angelo: Forget about your feet.</i>

41:06.826 --> 41:09.595
What are you talking about?
You're moving your feet.

41:09.629 --> 41:10.762
That's good.

41:12.732 --> 41:14.933
<i>- Which way are we going?
- This way.</i>

Whoa!

Hey, Angelo.

You're back.

41:25.778 --> 41:26.879
Come on in.

41:26.913 --> 41:27.946
We're doing bachata.

41:27.964 --> 41:30.749
Angelo doesn't know that I can't dance.

41:30.783 --> 41:32.617
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

41:32.635 --> 41:33.635
I guess we should have called.

41:33.670 --> 41:35.804
Oh no no no. It's fine.

41:35.839 --> 41:38.623
I made some homemade pizza. I'm
sure there's some left. Have some.

<i>Kathryn: Oh, you ate.</i>

41:39.809 --> 41:42.627
We were making lasagna.

41:42.645 --> 41:44.730
We had some leftover, so we just...

41:44.764 --> 41:46.648
Thank you so much. Appreciate it.

41:51.905 --> 41:52.855
Very.

41:52.906 --> 41:54.907
That's okay. We need to get back.

41:54.941 --> 41:56.742
Maybe next time.

41:56.776 --> 41:57.943
Oh, okay. But thank you for the lasagna.

41:57.977 --> 41:58.994
Yeah.
