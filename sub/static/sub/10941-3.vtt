00:00.245 --> 00:01.812
<i>Previously on "Heartland:"</i>

00:02.130 --> 00:03.697
- Hey!
- Hey, how's it goin'?

00:03.765 --> 00:05.299
I could use, uh,
15 more minutes.

00:05.366 --> 00:06.467
<i>You don't got it.</i>

00:06.568 --> 00:07.535
So, who's next?

00:08.737 --> 00:09.770
Oh!

00:09.838 --> 00:10.871
He still hasn't called.

00:10.939 --> 00:11.738
Who?

00:11.806 --> 00:13.673
Who do you think?
Peter!

00:13.741 --> 00:15.241
Have you tried
calling him?

00:15.309 --> 00:16.341
No!

00:16.410 --> 00:18.478
I don't wanna
seem desperate!

00:18.546 --> 00:19.879
<i>You lied to her!
You took her mom's money,</i>

00:19.947 --> 00:21.714
and now you won't even
fix her hot water heater.

00:21.782 --> 00:22.982
Just keep it up, man.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.484
You're never gonna get
your trailer back.

00:24.552 --> 00:26.085
We were married
a lot of years,

00:26.153 --> 00:28.487
we spent our honeymoon
right here.

00:28.555 --> 00:29.588
And then uh,

00:29.656 --> 00:31.356
then after her funeral, I,

00:31.424 --> 00:32.925
I spread her ashes
in the river.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.560
That sounds like
quite a love affair.

00:35.627 --> 00:37.496
I love this song.

00:37.564 --> 00:39.297
<i>Your gramma could sing,
that's for sure.</i>

00:45.537 --> 00:46.571
<i>It's fine, Lou.</i>

00:46.638 --> 00:47.939
<i>I don't have to be perfect.</i>

00:48.039 --> 00:50.207
Just hold still.

00:50.275 --> 00:53.043
I'll be sittin' still
on a hard bench

00:53.111 --> 00:55.947
for the next two
or more hours.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.247
I barely know
these people,

00:57.315 --> 00:59.649
why don't they just elope
or something?

00:59.717 --> 01:00.450
<i>Hello!</i>

01:02.353 --> 01:03.887
Ohhh... whoa!

01:03.955 --> 01:06.222
Don't you look nice!

01:06.290 --> 01:07.657
And don't you
look handsome!

01:07.725 --> 01:08.992
I love your outfit, Lisa.

01:09.059 --> 01:10.159
It's gorgeous.

01:10.227 --> 01:11.561
Paris sales.

01:11.629 --> 01:13.697
Nothing like it.

01:13.764 --> 01:14.865
You ready?

01:14.932 --> 01:16.331
Got the car all washed,
warmed up.

01:20.370 --> 01:21.971
No, I just mean...

01:22.038 --> 01:23.506
Going to a wedding,

01:23.573 --> 01:25.107
take my car?

01:25.174 --> 01:27.409
<i>What? My truck can't go
to a wedding?</i>

01:27.477 --> 01:29.678
For your information,

01:29.746 --> 01:32.446
I just washed
and polished it.

01:32.515 --> 01:35.550
I also vacuumed it,
specially,

01:35.618 --> 01:36.751
so you wouldn't get
any dirt

01:36.819 --> 01:38.820
on that beautiful
new suit of yours.

01:38.888 --> 01:41.355
Okay, then.
Your truck it is.

01:44.693 --> 01:46.561
<i>- See ya'!
- Bye!</i>

01:46.629 --> 01:48.395
Amy!

01:48.462 --> 01:50.531
Amy, have you seen
Kramer?

01:50.598 --> 01:51.632
Kramer...?

01:51.699 --> 01:53.433
Jake's new cow pony.
He escaped.

01:53.501 --> 01:54.668
<i>For like the 15th time!</i>

01:54.736 --> 01:56.369
He jumped over the paddock
fence and took off.

01:56.437 --> 01:57.638
You need to help us
find him!

01:57.705 --> 01:59.072
Well, I'm kinda busy
with Duke right now!

01:59.140 --> 02:00.507
Amy! This is important!

02:00.575 --> 02:02.910
Well, so is this!
This poor horse is grieving.

02:03.011 --> 02:04.544
Grieving?

02:04.578 --> 02:06.245
Yes! His stable-mate
died a month or so ago,

02:06.312 --> 02:08.014
and he hasn't gotten
over it.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.481
<i>So I'm tryin' to set him
up with Pegasus,</i>

02:09.550 --> 02:11.851
see if he'll be friends.

02:11.919 --> 02:13.052
<i>There's Caleb.
He'll help us.</i>

02:13.119 --> 02:14.153
C'mon!

02:14.220 --> 02:16.889
- Caleb! Hey! Caleb, wait up!
- Good. I know.

02:16.957 --> 02:18.190
I got a treat for 'ya.

02:18.258 --> 02:19.058
You want this?

02:20.492 --> 02:22.193
<i>So, you get in Friday.</i>

02:22.261 --> 02:23.127
<i>You sure?</i>

02:24.530 --> 02:25.964
You too.

02:26.032 --> 02:26.965
Okay. Bye.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.101
Oh! Wow.

02:30.169 --> 02:32.370
Paying bills, and carrying on
a romantic phone call,

02:32.438 --> 02:33.538
all at the same time?

02:33.606 --> 02:35.306
That's multi-tasking
at its finest!

02:35.407 --> 02:36.807
I'm so excited,

02:36.875 --> 02:38.075
<i>Peter's coming in
this weekend,</i>

02:38.142 --> 02:41.011
and we have the whole
dude ranch to ourselves,

02:41.079 --> 02:43.113
<i>so I figured
we'd go for a trail ride,</i>

02:43.181 --> 02:44.481
grill up some barbeque,
um...

02:44.549 --> 02:46.516
You really have to watch
this whole social director

02:46.585 --> 02:48.518
control freak thing.
Okay?

02:48.587 --> 02:51.055
Just have dinner
and let it go from there!

02:51.122 --> 02:53.489
Yeah, and since when
are you the romance guru?

02:53.557 --> 02:55.491
Oh, since I learned
from your mistakes.

02:55.559 --> 02:56.626
Ha ha.

02:56.694 --> 02:57.794
<i>I'm serious, though.</i>

02:57.861 --> 02:58.628
You don't have to plan
every minute.

02:58.696 --> 02:59.796
<i>Okay.</i>

02:59.863 --> 03:01.965
I'm excited to see him,
obviously, but...

03:02.032 --> 03:03.232
It's been like,
a month.

03:03.300 --> 03:04.767
And I don't know...

03:04.835 --> 03:06.069
What if it's awkward?

03:06.136 --> 03:07.169
It won't be.

03:07.237 --> 03:08.804
It'll be great!

03:08.871 --> 03:09.537
Yeah.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.924 --> 03:30.290
Uh, we need to figure out
the schedule.

03:30.358 --> 03:32.026
Figure out which horses
you wanna take on;

03:32.094 --> 03:33.193
Which you don't.

03:33.261 --> 03:34.729
Get your priorities
straight.

03:34.796 --> 03:36.163
Okay.

03:36.231 --> 03:38.499
Right now, my priority is
the end of School Formal.

03:38.566 --> 03:39.966
Oh!

03:40.034 --> 03:41.534
Yeah. I haven't had a whole lot
of time to shop for a dress.

03:41.602 --> 03:42.535
So, can I look
through your closet?

03:42.603 --> 03:43.970
Yes!

03:44.038 --> 03:46.039
Are you uh,
taking Ty?

03:46.107 --> 03:48.307
Yes!

03:48.375 --> 03:49.442
Yeah, I'm actually
really excited.

03:51.311 --> 03:52.612
Hey.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.313
Hey!
Uh, where were you?

03:54.381 --> 03:55.948
I was looking
for you earlier.

03:56.016 --> 03:57.716
I was just in town
to get some stuff.

03:57.784 --> 03:59.952
Some stuff in town?
Did you get a suit?

04:00.020 --> 04:01.353
A suit?

04:01.420 --> 04:02.855
For the dance.

04:02.922 --> 04:05.323
Oh! No, but I mean, I got
loads of time to do that, so.

04:05.391 --> 04:06.424
You only have a week.

04:06.492 --> 04:07.726
It's this Saturday?

04:07.794 --> 04:09.094
Yeah.

04:09.162 --> 04:10.395
Oh, I thought
it was next Saturday.

04:10.463 --> 04:13.264
Um... okay,
yeah, I'll do it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.067
"Where were you?

04:16.135 --> 04:18.036
Did you get a suit?
Where've you been?"

04:18.103 --> 04:20.370
Now who's the control freak?

04:20.438 --> 04:22.040
Jesus!

04:22.107 --> 04:23.808
Aw jeez.

04:23.876 --> 04:25.576
Probably the water pump,

04:25.644 --> 04:27.111
Or the... thermostat

04:27.179 --> 04:28.712
<i>or somethin'.</i>

04:30.214 --> 04:31.581
All right.

04:31.649 --> 04:33.616
I'll call my mechanic.

04:35.887 --> 04:37.387
No signal.

04:37.454 --> 04:38.689
Oh! And look at the time!

04:39.991 --> 04:42.392
We're gonna miss the ceremony!

04:42.459 --> 04:45.294
I swear this truck knew!

04:45.361 --> 04:46.428
Knew what?

04:46.496 --> 04:47.863
Knew you didn't wanna go
to this wedding,

04:47.931 --> 04:49.498
so it just up and died!

04:50.066 --> 04:53.102
So now my truck's
capable of ESP?

04:53.170 --> 04:55.037
Oh, so you're saying you
didn't wanna go to the wedding!

04:55.105 --> 04:55.871
Not even denying it!

04:55.939 --> 04:58.340
That's not what I said!

05:02.444 --> 05:04.045
Oh. Oh!

05:04.146 --> 05:05.213
Oh, no...

05:05.280 --> 05:06.881
Oh, no!!

05:06.949 --> 05:08.116

There he is!

05:53.692 --> 05:54.726
<i>Kramer!</i>

05:57.830 --> 05:59.164
I got him!

06:01.600 --> 06:03.034
Aw!

06:03.102 --> 06:04.602
I'll get him!

06:17.715 --> 06:19.750
<i>Hey! Hey, Ash!</i>

06:21.218 --> 06:22.218
Hey.

06:22.286 --> 06:23.887
How's the car running?

06:23.954 --> 06:25.121
Fine.

06:25.189 --> 06:27.123
And the roof?
Is it still leaking?

06:27.191 --> 06:28.557
Yep!

06:28.625 --> 06:31.494
I could come over
Saturday night and fix it.

06:31.561 --> 06:32.796
Mm... not doable.

06:32.863 --> 06:34.030
It's the Formal
on Saturday night.

06:34.131 --> 06:35.364
Big date!

06:36.466 --> 06:37.632
I wonder who
she's going with?

06:39.269 --> 06:40.702
Poor sucker.

06:58.453 --> 06:59.486
What happened?

06:59.554 --> 07:01.422
Did you miss
the wedding?

07:01.489 --> 07:03.390
Yes, we certainly did!

07:03.458 --> 07:05.492
Well, we could still
make the reception!

07:05.560 --> 07:06.894
Like this?

07:06.962 --> 07:08.429
By the time I get home
and change, it'll be over.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.596
It was a luncheon!

07:11.032 --> 07:12.465
<i>Oh, be... jeez!</i>

07:12.533 --> 07:13.967
Be careful there!

07:14.035 --> 07:16.069
You got a mark
right there!

07:16.137 --> 07:18.504
If you can see through
all the rust!

07:18.572 --> 07:20.406
Thanks.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.008
Well, that's pretty.

07:22.076 --> 07:23.343
Oh, thanks.
It's Lou's.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.945
I'm, uh... borrowing it
for the Formal.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.412
Needs a little shortening.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.413
I told you!

07:28.481 --> 07:29.348
Forget it!

07:30.884 --> 07:32.384
<i>Thanks, Jack.</i>

07:33.820 --> 07:37.622
Ty!
Could you take a look at this?

07:37.690 --> 07:40.125
The guy at the garage gave it
a clean bill of health

07:40.193 --> 07:41.392
just the other day,

07:41.460 --> 07:42.593
<i>and now,
it's overheating. I think.</i>

07:42.661 --> 07:43.895
Just shoot it, Jack!

07:43.963 --> 07:46.097
Put it out of its misery!

07:46.165 --> 07:47.565
My sentiments exactly!

07:48.834 --> 07:49.734
<i>Lise...</i>

07:49.801 --> 07:51.102
I'm sorry!

07:55.107 --> 07:57.474
I have to find
a date for the Formal.

07:57.541 --> 07:58.909
Why? I thought you said
you didn't want to go!

07:58.977 --> 08:02.179
I don't! But I told Caleb
that I have a date!

08:02.247 --> 08:03.213
Why would you
do that?

08:03.281 --> 08:04.381
Because he wanted
to come over

08:04.448 --> 08:06.616
on Saturday night,
and I wanted to be busy.

08:06.684 --> 08:08.485
Or at least make him
think I was.

08:08.552 --> 08:09.552
That's so cute.

08:09.620 --> 08:10.888
You do care!

08:10.955 --> 08:12.089
Hey, can you ask
your mom

08:12.156 --> 08:13.589
to advance me
a few weeks salary

08:13.656 --> 08:14.891
so that I can buy
a dress?

08:14.958 --> 08:16.492
You have a closet
full of dresses.

08:16.559 --> 08:19.362
Yeah, but I've worn
them all!

08:19.429 --> 08:21.898
Okay, I do have closets
full of dresses,

08:21.965 --> 08:23.099
but they're at my mom's
house.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.867
And I don't want
to go there!

08:24.935 --> 08:26.668
Aren't you forgetting
you need more than a dress?

08:26.736 --> 08:28.337
It's called a date!

08:33.075 --> 08:35.510
Like that's gonna be
a problem!

08:36.477 --> 08:38.111
- Hi!
- Hey.

08:38.212 --> 08:39.246
I'm Ashley,

08:39.313 --> 08:41.581
and I'll be
your server today,

08:41.649 --> 08:43.482
is there...
anything I can get you?

08:44.685 --> 08:46.120
Anything at all?

08:47.355 --> 08:48.289
Hey!

08:48.356 --> 08:49.089
Aw!

08:49.157 --> 08:50.690
<i>Oh!</i>

08:50.758 --> 08:51.825
Sorry.

08:51.893 --> 08:55.395
Um, can you be honest
with me?

08:55.462 --> 08:57.330
Are you looking forward
to this dance?

08:57.398 --> 08:59.232
Because we don't have to
go if you don't want to.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.133
Right.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.667
No, I mean it!

09:01.735 --> 09:03.836
It's your end
of school dance, Amy.

09:03.904 --> 09:04.837
Of course you should go.

09:04.905 --> 09:07.807
Well, yeah, of course
I should go,

09:07.874 --> 09:09.108
but you're not answering
my question.

09:09.176 --> 09:10.809
What was your question?

09:12.312 --> 09:13.312
Do you wanna go?

09:13.379 --> 09:15.547
Yes! I rock!

09:15.614 --> 09:18.283
Oh, no!

09:20.286 --> 09:21.153
Ty.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.020
Yeah?

09:22.088 --> 09:23.088
So, do you?

09:23.156 --> 09:24.456
Yeah. Yes.

09:25.658 --> 09:27.358
Of course I do.

09:28.026 --> 09:28.926
Okay.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.771
Aw, grandpa, no one
keeps a truck that long.

09:40.839 --> 09:44.207
<i>Oh yeah you do,
if it still runs.</i>

09:49.646 --> 09:50.580
See?

09:53.384 --> 09:54.851
Good as new.

09:57.821 --> 10:00.789
Oh, good for you, man.

10:02.492 --> 10:03.825
Take her for a spin,

10:03.893 --> 10:05.594
charge up the battery.

10:05.661 --> 10:07.229
It's not the battery,
Jack.

10:07.297 --> 10:08.964
It's everything else
under the hood.

10:09.032 --> 10:11.166
Your truck is dying
a slow and horrible death.

10:11.234 --> 10:13.135
Oh, the hell it is!

10:24.113 --> 10:25.213
Ask her!

10:27.249 --> 10:28.416
I know you're real
busy Amy,

10:28.484 --> 10:30.717
but can you possibly
find time in your schedule

10:30.784 --> 10:32.185
to work with Kramer?

10:32.253 --> 10:34.854
Maybe, help him understand
that it isn't such a good idea

10:34.922 --> 10:36.923
to jump fences and run away
all the time?

10:36.991 --> 10:38.291
<i>You have to, Amy.</i>

10:38.359 --> 10:40.160
Jake's parents are threatening
to sell Kramer,

10:40.228 --> 10:41.261
if he doesn't stop
escaping.

10:44.499 --> 10:48.600
Kramer, you're a good lookin'
boy, aren'tcha?

10:49.336 --> 10:50.569
Okay...

10:50.637 --> 10:52.971
You see how his ears are
wide at the base and the top?

10:53.040 --> 10:55.141
Well, it means that he's got
loads of energy,

10:55.208 --> 10:57.209
and will seize the moment,
given the chance.

10:57.277 --> 10:58.577
Yeah.
To escape!

11:00.480 --> 11:01.580
Hey, Duke!

11:03.416 --> 11:05.283
Huh! You like him,
don't you?

11:07.553 --> 11:09.887
Good boy!

11:09.955 --> 11:11.389
Here you go!

11:16.429 --> 11:18.595
<i>You know, that is the first
horse</i>

11:18.663 --> 11:20.029
<i>that Duke has paid
any attention to</i>

11:20.030 --> 11:20.830
<i>since he's been here.</i>

11:20.898 --> 11:21.932
He might be just the thing

11:21.999 --> 11:23.967
to coax Duke
out of his little mood.

11:24.035 --> 11:24.968
You think?

11:25.036 --> 11:26.336
Yeah.

11:26.404 --> 11:28.705
How about I agree to take on
your fence jumper--

11:28.773 --> 11:31.208
But I... I can't afford
to pay you much.

11:31.276 --> 11:32.576
Oh! You know what?

11:32.643 --> 11:34.044
Forget it. He's helping me out
with Duke anyway,

11:34.111 --> 11:36.546
so, no pay is necessary.

11:52.061 --> 11:54.463
Grandpa, I know
you love your truck.

11:54.530 --> 11:55.464
But you have to admit,

11:55.531 --> 11:57.265
it's been letting
you down lately.

11:57.333 --> 11:58.833
And costing you
a fortune!

11:58.901 --> 12:00.802
We're just saying,
maybe it's time.

12:00.869 --> 12:02.937
To trade it in!

12:03.005 --> 12:04.739
While you can still
drive it to the dealership.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.541
Look, before you guys
make the big mistake

12:07.609 --> 12:10.211
of thinking this is you
decision to make

12:10.278 --> 12:12.379
and not mine,

12:12.447 --> 12:14.582
how about some dessert?

12:14.649 --> 12:15.882
<i>Jack, you gotta face facts.</i>

12:15.950 --> 12:17.551
Why don't you come
into town with me tomorrow,

12:17.619 --> 12:19.686
and just look
at some new trucks.

12:19.754 --> 12:21.589
Yeah! Look, right?

12:21.656 --> 12:22.888
There's no harm in looking.

12:22.956 --> 12:26.759
Yeah. No one's saying
you have to buy anything.

12:29.530 --> 12:31.364
So, that was a baby step
in the right direction.

12:32.632 --> 12:34.634
I'll believe
it when I see it.

12:34.701 --> 12:37.237
So...
Hudson High Formal?

12:38.138 --> 12:39.771
Yeah.

12:39.839 --> 12:41.406
Amy's really excited.

12:41.474 --> 12:43.942
She's really looking
forward to it.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.010
I know. Uh...

12:46.212 --> 12:47.812
What?

12:47.880 --> 12:48.913
The thing is,

12:48.981 --> 12:50.182
um... the dance,

12:50.250 --> 12:52.484
I'm not so sure
that I...

12:53.620 --> 12:54.985
Aw, forget it.

12:55.053 --> 12:56.020
What?

12:56.087 --> 12:57.821
No, it... it's nothing.
It's stupid.

12:57.889 --> 12:58.756
Here.

12:58.823 --> 13:00.824
No, what's wrong?

13:02.127 --> 13:03.494
Well, there's a few
things. But...

13:03.562 --> 13:04.495
Like what?

13:05.797 --> 13:08.399
Like, I can't dance!

13:08.467 --> 13:10.134
You've come to the right girl.

13:11.902 --> 13:12.935
- All right!
- I got ya.

13:13.849 --> 13:14.917
<i>This little honey,</i>

13:15.136 --> 13:16.803
very popular
with the ranchers.

13:16.871 --> 13:18.138
It's practical,

13:18.205 --> 13:19.606
and it's solid.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.174
Oh, it's the
worst colour I ever saw!

13:21.242 --> 13:23.043
Jack, it comes
in other colours.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.310
Jeez! Is...

13:24.378 --> 13:26.445
Is this the price,
or the serial number?

13:26.513 --> 13:28.480
That's the base price,
yes.

13:28.549 --> 13:29.415
Base price?

13:30.984 --> 13:32.184
I should get a whole
fleet of trucks

13:32.252 --> 13:34.119
for that price!

13:34.187 --> 13:35.555
Okay, Jack.

13:35.622 --> 13:37.657
Listen, my dad ran this lot
for a lot of years,

13:37.724 --> 13:40.592
and I know you and him
go way back, so...

13:40.660 --> 13:42.460
I think I got a truck
that I know you're gonna love.

13:42.528 --> 13:44.829
And it's a great deal!

13:47.366 --> 13:48.600
So, it's a demo,

13:48.668 --> 13:51.502
and the new models
are comin' in,

13:51.571 --> 13:53.939
so I can let you
have it

13:54.006 --> 13:56.640
for a really great
price.

13:58.376 --> 13:59.810
There you go.

14:00.679 --> 14:03.881
Ha! That's your
"really great" price?

14:03.949 --> 14:06.050
Ah, but we can talk!

14:07.351 --> 14:08.953
I'll think about it.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.721
Okay...

14:10.789 --> 14:12.722
What is the matter?

14:14.124 --> 14:15.291
Rule number one,

14:15.358 --> 14:17.359
you can't make a deal
first time around,

14:17.427 --> 14:19.028
you gotta keep
these sales guys

14:19.096 --> 14:20.162
nervous about their
commission!

14:20.230 --> 14:21.397
This has nothing to do

14:21.465 --> 14:23.566
with keeping
the salesman nervous.

14:23.634 --> 14:25.969
You simply don't wanna buy
a new truck.

14:26.036 --> 14:29.504
Even though this one does
nothing but frustrate you!

14:29.572 --> 14:30.639
What is it about
this truck

14:30.707 --> 14:33.976
that you can't bear
to part with?

14:36.112 --> 14:37.613
He ate all his food
this morning.

14:37.680 --> 14:38.680
That's a first.

14:38.748 --> 14:39.915
He found
a new best friend!

14:39.983 --> 14:41.783
I found out why.

14:41.851 --> 14:43.952
I called the owners,
and it turns out

14:44.020 --> 14:45.352
that his old best friend

14:45.420 --> 14:47.989
was a black and white paint
just like Kramer!

14:48.056 --> 14:49.056
Oh, that's so weird.

14:49.124 --> 14:51.691
Well, it makes sense,
right?

14:52.994 --> 14:54.260
Hey!
Where are you going?

14:54.328 --> 14:55.762
I'll be back soon.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.333
Is there something
going on with Ty?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.735
How would I know?

15:01.802 --> 15:04.270
Well, because you usually
know everything.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.373
What I do know is Ashley's
going to the Formal,

15:07.441 --> 15:09.574
and her date is really cute,
and really rich.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.110
He goes to some
private school.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.210
Frat boy.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.747
Frat boy.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.750
I know if you had any guts
you would have asked her first.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.451
And she would've said yes.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.386
I admit,
it boggles the mind,

15:21.454 --> 15:22.487
but she would have.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.522
How do you know that,
huh?

15:24.589 --> 15:26.223
A woman knows.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.795
<i>Now, look at this one.</i>

15:30.863 --> 15:31.996
You got leather seats,

15:32.064 --> 15:34.132
air conditioning, GPS.

15:34.199 --> 15:35.800
Juke box player.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.702
Like I'd ever use that.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.170
Well, I'll use it, Jack.

15:39.237 --> 15:41.004
Like I'd ever
let you drive it!

15:41.072 --> 15:42.305
So, Grandpa...

15:42.373 --> 15:43.573
So, grandpa what?

15:43.641 --> 15:44.908
So, if you're already
possessive

15:44.976 --> 15:46.209
about who gets to drive it,

15:46.277 --> 15:49.012
you may actually
be considering it, right?

15:49.080 --> 15:50.681
Wrong.

15:50.748 --> 15:52.549
Well, I think you're making
the right decision.

15:52.616 --> 15:54.184
There is no decision!

15:54.251 --> 15:55.485
Come on, Grandpa!

15:55.553 --> 15:57.720
I man, it's about time
we sprung for a new truck.

15:57.788 --> 15:59.722
What .... what if Amy and I
were driving the other one

15:59.790 --> 16:01.157
and it stalled out
in the middle of nowhere?

16:01.224 --> 16:02.658
Yes! In the middle
of the night

16:02.726 --> 16:04.126
with coyotes howling...

16:04.194 --> 16:07.863
Yeah, and grizzly
bears circling around.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.433
I'm going to bed.

16:14.636 --> 16:17.271
Well, I think progress
is being made here.

16:20.076 --> 16:23.178
You wanna watch a movie?

16:23.245 --> 16:25.346
I'm... pretty wiped.

16:26.281 --> 16:27.248
<i>C'mon!</i>

16:27.316 --> 16:28.849
I gotta get
some sleep.

16:28.917 --> 16:30.317
But I'll see you
in the morning.

16:33.321 --> 16:34.021
Night, Lou.

16:34.089 --> 16:34.855
Night.

16:36.124 --> 16:38.025
Well...

16:38.093 --> 16:39.960
And where are you going?

16:40.028 --> 16:41.161
Uh, dude ranch.

16:41.229 --> 16:42.863
Gotta lock up.

16:46.033 --> 16:46.799
<i>Okay, you gotta loosen up.</i>

16:47.835 --> 16:49.668
Okay. 1, 2, 3...

16:49.737 --> 16:51.704
1, 2. Okay. Look up!

16:51.772 --> 16:52.872
Slide your feet.

16:52.940 --> 16:54.006
Take little steps,
that way,

16:54.074 --> 16:54.874
you're less likely...
Ow!

16:54.942 --> 16:57.476
Step on my toe!

16:57.544 --> 16:58.544
Ow.               - Sorry!
Okay. No, it's okay.

16:58.862 --> 17:00.128
Look, um. This...
I'm sorry.

17:00.196 --> 17:01.329
This isn't gonna work.

17:01.397 --> 17:02.597
Uh, it's a bit more
complicated...

17:02.664 --> 17:03.999
It's really not complicated,
it's not.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.367
It's just 1, 2, 3,

17:06.435 --> 17:07.667
what?

17:07.736 --> 17:09.936
It's a school dance.

17:10.006 --> 17:13.375
I'm what... how many years
older than anyone else there.

17:13.442 --> 17:14.709
Me and high school,
it's just...

17:14.776 --> 17:16.776
It's not a good fit.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.646
What if I embarrass
the hell out of Amy?

17:19.714 --> 17:20.646
I don't wanna ruin it
for her!

17:20.714 --> 17:21.748
I wanted this to be
a good night.

17:21.816 --> 17:23.117
I want...

17:23.184 --> 17:24.550
Ty.

17:24.618 --> 17:27.954
In case you haven't noticed,
my sister adores you.

17:28.022 --> 17:31.591
You're not gonna ruin it
for her, okay?

17:31.659 --> 17:34.927
You guys have something
so... great.

17:34.995 --> 17:37.363
So simple, I...

17:37.431 --> 17:39.865
I wish I could have
what you guys have.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.167
I'm jealous!

17:41.235 --> 17:42.968
Okay?

17:43.037 --> 17:44.404
Don't worry.

17:44.471 --> 17:45.871
Come on!
Let's try it again.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.240
Come on!

17:47.307 --> 17:49.574
Okay, okay, okay.

17:49.642 --> 17:51.543
1, 2, 3, 1...

17:51.610 --> 17:53.145
You know what?

17:53.212 --> 17:54.179
I'm sorry,
I can't do this.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.247
Yes, you can!

17:55.314 --> 17:56.614
Thanks, but...

17:56.682 --> 17:57.715
It's not gonna work.

17:57.783 --> 17:58.783
<i>Ty!</i>

18:01.720 --> 18:04.088
Mike, I've never had
a car loan in my life.

18:04.156 --> 18:06.090
I'm a little nervous
about the whole idea.

18:06.158 --> 18:08.159
We'll have a coffee,
and talk about it.

18:08.226 --> 18:09.160
I'm glad you came
to see me.

18:09.227 --> 18:10.227
Yeah!

18:10.295 --> 18:11.362
You've got nothing
to worry about.

18:11.430 --> 18:12.763
Yeah!

18:12.830 --> 18:15.132
I know you're a "cash
on the line" kind of guy,

18:15.200 --> 18:17.168
but most people
do get a loan

18:17.235 --> 18:19.070
when they buy
a vehicle.

18:19.137 --> 18:20.937
You need a truck,
right?

18:21.004 --> 18:21.904
Apparently.

18:24.108 --> 18:25.608
And you have
a decent down payment?

18:25.676 --> 18:26.709
Oh, yeah.

18:26.777 --> 18:28.111
And you can't deny,

18:28.179 --> 18:29.446
you got some pretty good years
outta your old one.

18:29.513 --> 18:30.613
Uh-huh.

18:30.681 --> 18:34.050
So, if you think
it's time for a change,

18:34.118 --> 18:35.518
I'm sure we can work
something out

18:35.586 --> 18:38.053
that you'll be
comfortable with.

18:38.121 --> 18:39.621
You've made the
right decision, Jack.

18:39.689 --> 18:41.457
You got a sweet deal
with the $1000 you got

18:41.524 --> 18:42.958
for your old truck
on trade in.

18:43.025 --> 18:44.426
Yeah, sweet deal,
sure,

18:44.494 --> 18:45.827
it's worth a hell of a lot
more than that!

18:45.895 --> 18:46.995
Jack...

18:47.063 --> 18:48.564
Well, he's just gonna
turn around and sell it

18:48.631 --> 18:50.365
for three times
as much!

18:50.433 --> 18:51.433
No way!

18:51.501 --> 18:53.067
We're not makin' a cent
on that thing,

18:53.135 --> 18:55.769
it's goin'
to truck heaven.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.941
New beginnings.

19:06.582 --> 19:08.681
It's pretty cool, Jack!

19:11.852 --> 19:13.587
This is awesome!

19:13.654 --> 19:15.322
Oh Lou, it evens smells
like new car.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.992
Grandpa!
This is great!

19:19.059 --> 19:20.760
Good for you.

19:20.828 --> 19:22.262
He drove a very hard
bargain.

19:22.330 --> 19:23.663
You would've been
impressed.

19:23.731 --> 19:26.031
Didn't 'ya?

19:27.100 --> 19:28.267
Scratches!

19:36.843 --> 19:38.944
Hey! So, Grandpa's had
that truck for what,

19:39.012 --> 19:40.878
four days, and he finally
let me drive it.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.413
I had to pry the keys
out of his hands!

19:42.481 --> 19:44.081
Oh! Ty,
it is so cool!

19:44.150 --> 19:45.983
That stereo, awesome!

19:46.051 --> 19:47.718
I was, thinkin' maybe you could
ask him to borrow it

19:47.786 --> 19:49.220
for the dance?

19:49.288 --> 19:51.922
Um... look, Amy.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.090
I'm not so sure
it's such a good idea that-

19:53.159 --> 19:54.292
Ty!

19:54.360 --> 19:55.760
Ty, it'll be great!
You just ask him, right?

19:55.827 --> 19:56.893
What's the worst
that can happen?

19:56.961 --> 19:57.961
He'll say no?

19:58.029 --> 19:59.029
Ddo you think maybe
you could help me

19:59.096 --> 20:00.197
you could help me
take the horses out?

20:00.265 --> 20:01.398
Um...

20:01.466 --> 20:03.367
I can't.
I got some stuff to do.

20:03.434 --> 20:05.135
Like what?

20:05.203 --> 20:06.170
I uhhh...

20:06.237 --> 20:07.337
Gotta pick up my suit!

20:07.405 --> 20:08.572
Oh. Okay.

20:09.674 --> 20:11.308
Can't wait
to see you in it.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.908
I'll see you.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.313
Oh!

20:20.817 --> 20:22.585
Amy changed the damn
seat settings,

20:22.653 --> 20:24.420
I can't get it back
to where I want it.

20:26.490 --> 20:27.623
Here, Jack.
Don't touch it.

20:27.691 --> 20:28.590
Here,
let me do it.

20:28.658 --> 20:30.192
- I got it!
- Here, don't just...

20:32.795 --> 20:35.297
Well, that's not it.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.298
I might as
well take a nap!

20:36.365 --> 20:38.233
Here.

20:38.301 --> 20:39.301
How's that?

20:39.368 --> 20:41.836
Well,
I need more leg room.

20:41.904 --> 20:44.938
God. Could these seats
be any harder?

20:46.408 --> 20:47.608
This is...
Can't rest my...

20:47.676 --> 20:49.643
Knocked my hat
clean off!

20:49.711 --> 20:51.312
You'll
get used to it, Jack.

20:51.379 --> 20:52.613
It's good to try
new things.

20:52.681 --> 20:54.682
Well, you're one
to talk.

20:54.749 --> 20:57.284
Your truck's older
than mine was!

20:57.352 --> 20:58.319
That's different!

20:58.386 --> 21:00.320
Well,
how is it different?

21:00.387 --> 21:01.487
<i>Mine's a classic.</i>

21:01.555 --> 21:04.156
And mine wasn't?

21:09.396 --> 21:11.063
Mine still runs.

21:16.369 --> 21:17.302
What?

21:20.189 --> 21:21.356
Caleb!

21:21.423 --> 21:22.858
Look.

21:22.925 --> 21:24.092
That trailer?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.594
It's in my best interest
to fix it,

21:25.661 --> 21:28.697
since it is still,
after all, my trailer.

21:28.764 --> 21:31.232
If the roof keeps leaking,
it's gonna rot the floor.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.433
Well, it's too late.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.634
I already bought carpeting
to cover the holes

21:33.702 --> 21:35.002
that were already there.
Oh!!

21:35.069 --> 21:36.203
Remind me
to send you the bill.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.605
Fine.

21:37.672 --> 21:38.839
But I'm fixing it
tomorrow night.

21:38.907 --> 21:39.940
It's even better
if you're out.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.509
Mm, that's not gonna work.

21:41.576 --> 21:43.811
I mean, what if I wanna
bring a friend back?

21:43.879 --> 21:45.278
You know...

21:46.414 --> 21:48.048
After the dance.

21:48.116 --> 21:49.382
If you're trying
to make me jealous Ashley,

21:49.449 --> 21:50.483
it's not gonna work.

21:50.551 --> 21:51.518
I could care less
if you're jealous.

21:51.585 --> 21:54.153
I'm not jealous!

21:57.625 --> 21:59.125
Bottom line.

21:59.192 --> 22:01.961
I want my trailer back,
with or without a leaky roof.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.030
The sooner you're out,
the better.

22:04.097 --> 22:06.899
Well,
I'm not going anywhere.

22:13.006 --> 22:14.339
Why are they separated?

22:14.407 --> 22:16.341
Well, Duke's actually
starting to socialize

22:16.409 --> 22:18.610
<i>with other horses now,
so I'm encouraging it.</i>

22:18.678 --> 22:20.678
What about Kramer's
crazy habit?

22:20.746 --> 22:22.479
<i>You know, he's actually
been totally fine</i>

22:22.548 --> 22:23.881
since he's been here.

22:23.949 --> 22:25.349
Maybe it was just a phase
he was going through.

22:35.027 --> 22:36.260
<i>There.</i>

22:36.327 --> 22:37.594
That's what he does.

22:37.695 --> 22:38.628
That was.

22:38.696 --> 22:40.363
He's a natural born jumper!

22:40.431 --> 22:41.831
That was amazing!

22:44.101 --> 22:47.236
How's that beautiful new
truck of yours?

22:49.139 --> 22:50.674
Know what I think
we should do?

22:50.741 --> 22:52.841
I think we should take I
on a road trip.

22:52.909 --> 22:54.242
I hear there's a brand new
restaurant

22:54.310 --> 22:56.979
up near Lake Louise
it's getting rave reviews.

22:57.047 --> 22:59.848
What do you think
about that?

23:01.551 --> 23:02.517
What's wrong?

23:02.586 --> 23:04.620
No, nothing's wrong.

23:08.124 --> 23:09.791
The truck.
I hate the truck.

23:09.858 --> 23:11.158
I hate the way
it feels,

23:11.226 --> 23:13.928
I hate that a computer controls
every damn thing in it,

23:13.996 --> 23:16.263
I hate that I can't feel
any bumps in the road--

23:16.331 --> 23:17.565
No bumps is supposed
to be a good thing.

23:17.633 --> 23:18.700
It's supposed
to be a truck,

23:18.767 --> 23:20.668
not a... damn hearse!

23:20.736 --> 23:21.736
A hearse?

23:21.804 --> 23:24.105
They can keep
their "smooth" ride.

23:24.172 --> 23:25.305
It's not like
you didn't test drive it.

23:25.372 --> 23:27.808
Oh, you can't tell anything
on a test drive!

23:27.875 --> 23:29.910
The sales guy's sittin'
right there next to me,

23:29.978 --> 23:32.545
yappin' the whole time,
it all happened too fast.

23:32.614 --> 23:33.747
It didn't happen
that fast!

23:33.815 --> 23:37.450
Not to mention
all the pressure I got from...

23:37.518 --> 23:38.685
From who?

23:38.753 --> 23:39.820
From me?
You got pressure from me?

23:39.921 --> 23:41.520
Yes,
I got pressure from you

23:41.588 --> 23:43.689
and I got pressure
from everybody else!

23:43.757 --> 23:45.357
I guess we
were pressuring you,

23:45.425 --> 23:46.592
but Jack,
you know what?

23:46.660 --> 23:47.627
The old truck was done.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.328
You had to do something!

23:49.395 --> 23:50.930
I mean...

23:50.998 --> 23:52.531
Take this truck
out on the road,

23:52.599 --> 23:54.366
drive it,
and give it a chance!

23:54.434 --> 23:56.701
You know,
that's a damn good idea.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.241
Where are you going?

24:03.308 --> 24:05.543
Fishing cabin.

24:05.611 --> 24:07.879
I need some fresh air.

24:11.674 --> 24:13.242
It's sad.
That's what it is.

24:13.609 --> 24:14.809
It's their first
real fight.

24:14.878 --> 24:16.111
Well, Jack's stubborn.

24:16.179 --> 24:17.479
If he doesn't want
to do something,

24:17.546 --> 24:19.114
he's gonna make everyone else's
life miserable.

24:19.182 --> 24:20.715
Well, most men
don't  like change.

24:20.783 --> 24:22.784
You know, I don't know why
we put up with you!

24:22.852 --> 24:24.585
We'd be better off
without them.

24:25.820 --> 24:28.222
Max! Buddy, hi!

24:28.290 --> 24:29.823
<i>Hey, Peter.</i>

24:29.892 --> 24:31.192
Peter!

24:31.260 --> 24:32.059
<i>Hey!</i>

24:32.127 --> 24:33.060
Mm! Mm!

24:34.396 --> 24:38.332
Yup. She'd be better off
without them...

25:26.611 --> 25:29.879
I'm kind of surprised
Grandpa isn't back yet.

25:29.948 --> 25:32.249
I guess he just needed
to get away.

25:32.317 --> 25:34.384
So, your new suit?
Can I see it?

25:34.452 --> 25:35.718
Not now!

25:35.786 --> 25:37.387
Why not?

25:37.455 --> 25:39.389
Why?
I gotta go out!

25:40.558 --> 25:42.025
You're always going out!

25:42.093 --> 25:43.826
Talk about Grandpa
not wanting to do something

25:43.927 --> 25:46.228
And making life
miserable!

25:46.263 --> 25:48.864
What's that supposed
to mean?

25:48.932 --> 25:50.099
The dance.

25:50.167 --> 25:51.100
You don't wanna go
to the dance.

25:51.168 --> 25:52.468
Amy, I...

25:52.502 --> 25:54.136
You've been avoiding
talking about it all week,

25:54.237 --> 25:55.637
And on top of that,
you've been bailing on me!

25:55.705 --> 25:57.173
I've just had some stuff
to do, that's...

25:57.240 --> 25:58.874
What stuff?!

25:58.942 --> 26:00.342
You know, stuff.
I, I...

26:00.409 --> 26:02.510
You just... You make me
really mad sometimes. I...

26:02.578 --> 26:03.911
Amy, look

26:12.121 --> 26:13.254
Hi Lisa.

26:14.623 --> 26:16.790
No, he's still not back yet.

26:19.094 --> 26:20.327
Yeah, yeah.

26:20.395 --> 26:22.162
Come on over.
I'm...

26:22.230 --> 26:24.764
I'm feeling a bit
ditched myself.

26:24.866 --> 26:26.033
Do you want some wine?

26:26.101 --> 26:27.034
Sure.

26:27.068 --> 26:28.435
Hey.
So, here's the plan.

26:28.503 --> 26:30.371
I was thinking
we could BBQ some steaks,

26:30.438 --> 26:33.439
and then go for a moonlight
canoe ride?

26:33.507 --> 26:35.041
- Sure.
- If you don't wanna...

26:35.109 --> 26:36.942
go for a canoe ride,
we could um...

26:37.044 --> 26:38.244
just chill out
on the dock,

26:38.312 --> 26:39.945
Or... hey!
I've got Scrabble!

26:40.047 --> 26:40.980
Do you play Scrabble?

26:41.048 --> 26:42.382
I got a few...

26:42.483 --> 26:44.550
- Sure, Scrabble's fine...
-  I think I have it.

26:46.353 --> 26:48.453
Oh. Just one second.

26:52.025 --> 26:52.891
Hey, Lou.

26:52.958 --> 26:53.892
Hey... so I changed
my mind.

26:53.959 --> 26:55.827
I think we need
to do this.

26:58.564 --> 27:00.098
Hey.

27:00.133 --> 27:01.433
Hey! Uh...

27:01.501 --> 27:02.501
Sorry, this is a bad time,
right?

27:02.568 --> 27:03.734
- I'll go.
- No, no.

27:03.801 --> 27:05.002
It's um...
It's a good time.

27:05.070 --> 27:06.770
Good time for what?

27:07.805 --> 27:09.973
Uh, my dance lesson.

27:10.008 --> 27:11.509
Dance lesson?!!

27:11.543 --> 27:12.443
Yeah.

27:15.413 --> 27:16.780
I should never
have been the one

27:16.848 --> 27:19.049
to suggest that Jack
get a new truck.

27:19.116 --> 27:21.517
I certainly shouldn't have
dragged him to the dealership!

27:21.585 --> 27:22.885
Well,

27:22.920 --> 27:24.520
I should've never pushed Ty
so hard about the dance

27:24.588 --> 27:25.487
I mean, it pretty much
turned him off

27:25.556 --> 27:26.388
the whole thing!

27:26.456 --> 27:27.423
You know,
I could've waited

27:27.490 --> 27:28.691
until that old truck
broke down,

27:28.759 --> 27:30.325
and he was stranded
by himself,

27:30.393 --> 27:32.161
and he would've come
to the conclusion on his own.

27:32.228 --> 27:34.697
But why does he have to be
disappearing all the time?

27:34.765 --> 27:35.797
All mysterious...

27:35.865 --> 27:37.532
And why did he have
to take off?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.000
We could've just discussed it!
I mean...

27:39.068 --> 27:41.102
Guys make me so crazy!

27:41.170 --> 27:41.970
They're just so...

27:42.038 --> 27:43.204
Stubborn!

27:43.272 --> 27:45.506
Yes! They are!

27:46.475 --> 27:47.642
I know.

27:47.710 --> 27:48.843
You're still gonna go
to the dance, aren't you?

27:48.911 --> 27:50.812
Oh, I don't know.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.781
Okay.

27:53.848 --> 27:54.882
Hold on.

27:54.950 --> 27:57.417
This is gonna decide it.

27:59.654 --> 28:00.688
I hope.

28:02.824 --> 28:05.225
A little something
for you.

28:08.829 --> 28:10.697
Oh...

28:10.764 --> 28:11.898
You've gotta be
kidding me!

28:11.966 --> 28:13.232
This...

28:13.300 --> 28:14.767
Aw...

28:14.835 --> 28:15.635
This is beautiful!

28:15.703 --> 28:17.036
I got it in Paris
on sale,

28:17.104 --> 28:18.905
and I just...
I saw it on you,

28:18.973 --> 28:20.707
and I should've waited
for your birthday,

28:20.774 --> 28:23.409
but I think you might wanna
wear it to the dance.

28:23.477 --> 28:24.309
Um, yeah!

28:24.376 --> 28:25.410
This is...

28:25.478 --> 28:27.212
This is pretty much
the best dress

28:27.279 --> 28:29.047
I've ever and will ever have.
Thank you!

28:29.115 --> 28:30.181
Aw!

28:30.249 --> 28:31.516
Wow!
You're amazing!

28:31.584 --> 28:33.819
I'm glad
someone thinks so!

You always say that.

31:04.804 --> 31:06.472
And I always mean it.

31:07.540 --> 31:09.508
It's for the new album.

31:09.576 --> 31:10.609
I know it's corny,

31:10.677 --> 31:12.143
but people love corny.

31:13.579 --> 31:15.880
Maybe it'll go gold.

<i>Hey!</i>

Got somethin' to show 'ya!
C'mon.

31:30.228 --> 31:32.662
If you could see
your face right now!

31:32.730 --> 31:35.432
Lyndy...
Now what's goin' on?

31:35.500 --> 31:37.267
I drove our old clunker
into town this morning,

31:37.335 --> 31:38.802
and picked up this one.

31:38.870 --> 31:42.306
You never even heard me leave,
did you?

31:42.374 --> 31:43.772
Happy anniversary.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.008
Anniversary?

31:45.075 --> 31:48.311
That's not for another...
month or so.

31:48.379 --> 31:50.179
Yeah, I know.

31:50.247 --> 31:52.681
But the last album's doing
pretty good.

31:52.749 --> 31:54.017
I had a royalty cheque
burning a big fat hole

31:54.084 --> 31:55.418
in my pocket.

31:55.486 --> 31:57.920
You're giving me a truck?

31:57.988 --> 31:59.954
A brand new truck?

32:00.923 --> 32:04.259
We don't need a new truck.

32:04.327 --> 32:06.728
<i>Look, I know you have a hard
time with change, Jackson.</i>

32:06.795 --> 32:08.397
You always do, but...

32:08.464 --> 32:10.499
Change isn't a bad thing.

32:12.068 --> 32:15.503
I hope you have this baby
for a very long time.

32:16.704 --> 32:18.672
You're crazy, Lyndy.

32:18.740 --> 32:20.274
You are one crazy lady!

32:21.309 --> 32:23.244
You're damn lucky I am!

32:23.311 --> 32:26.113
You need someone
to keep you young!

33:08.520 --> 33:09.587
<i>Hi.</i>

33:10.456 --> 33:12.856
Is it okay that I'm here?

33:13.959 --> 33:16.927
It's more than okay
that you're here.

33:18.697 --> 33:19.796
Come're.

33:35.612 --> 33:37.779
Well, you absolutely have
a jumper here, Jake.

33:37.847 --> 33:39.115
You think?

33:39.182 --> 33:41.250
Yes! I mean, he doesn't jump
fences to escape,

33:41.318 --> 33:43.319
he does it 'cause
he loves jumping.

33:43.386 --> 33:44.653
<i>Any excuse, you know,
to...</i>

33:44.721 --> 33:45.754
See the horses
in the next field, whatever.

33:45.822 --> 33:47.189
He's gonna do
what he loves most.

33:47.257 --> 33:48.657
So, what do I do?

33:48.725 --> 33:50.025
Well, let him jump.

33:50.093 --> 33:51.759
I don't think Jake's parents
would go for that.

33:51.860 --> 33:54.195
No, I don't mean
like, over fences like this,

33:54.263 --> 33:55.263
bring him over here,
and I'll take him

33:55.331 --> 33:56.464
round the course
any time.

33:56.532 --> 33:58.032
It'll get rid of
all his energy,

33:58.100 --> 34:00.268
and I don't think he'll be
jumping fences any more.

34:00.336 --> 34:01.202
Cool.

34:01.270 --> 34:02.370
Hey!

34:02.438 --> 34:03.871
You still wanna learn
how to jump?

34:03.939 --> 34:05.773
'Cause this would be
the perfect horse for you.

34:05.841 --> 34:07.008
You guys can learn
together.

34:07.075 --> 34:09.009
You're kidding!
Are you kidding?

34:09.076 --> 34:10.110
Can I, would you mind?

34:10.178 --> 34:11.811
No, go for it.

34:12.947 --> 34:13.847
Good job, Mallory.

34:13.914 --> 34:15.449
Just a nice trot,

34:15.516 --> 34:18.018
<i>very good,
just stay relaxed.</i>

34:18.085 --> 34:19.520
Stay steady,

34:20.420 --> 34:21.522
yes! Good job!

34:21.589 --> 34:23.184
<i>Yeah! Go Mallory!</i>

34:23.257 --> 34:24.790
I did it!

34:26.059 --> 34:27.226
Atta boy!

34:27.293 --> 34:28.960
A clean bucket,
that's more like it!

34:29.029 --> 34:30.496
- Hey!
- Hey, good mornin'.

34:30.563 --> 34:32.097
- Good mornin'.
- He ate everything.

34:32.166 --> 34:33.366
Wow!

34:33.433 --> 34:34.567
You know, I think he's
almost ready to go home.

34:34.635 --> 34:36.702
Aren'tcha, Duke?

34:36.770 --> 34:39.771
I uh... I don't know.

34:39.838 --> 34:40.905
I was kinda hopin'
I'd see you last night

34:40.973 --> 34:43.007
after you were done
all your "stuff"...

34:43.074 --> 34:45.976
I went to bed early.

34:46.045 --> 34:47.478
Again?

34:48.714 --> 34:51.315
I have to get rested up
for the dance!

34:51.384 --> 34:52.850
I'm pumped.
And...

34:52.918 --> 34:54.952
I'm sorry if it seemed
like I wasn't...

34:55.020 --> 34:55.886
You know...
Looking forward to it,

34:55.953 --> 34:57.221
but I am.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.023
Okay.

35:00.091 --> 35:01.192
It's gonna be fun,
okay?

35:03.695 --> 35:05.162
Good morning
someone slept in.

35:05.230 --> 35:08.031
You uh... got a comb there,
cowboy?

35:08.099 --> 35:09.500
Where were you
last night?

35:09.568 --> 35:11.068
2 A.M., man!

35:11.135 --> 35:15.138
<i>I didn't get back to sleep
until the sun came up!</i>

35:15.206 --> 35:16.306
<i>You know what?</i>

35:16.373 --> 35:18.809
I can't do this
any more.

35:18.876 --> 35:20.143
I need my trailer
back.

35:21.846 --> 35:23.880
You went to bed early?
Um...

35:23.948 --> 35:25.115
- Amy, I can...
- No, no!

35:25.183 --> 35:26.282
You know what, Ty?
It's probably better

35:26.350 --> 35:28.184
if you just don't come
to the dance.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.484
<i>Forget it!</i>

35:32.155 --> 35:33.589
Okay.
You want my advice?

35:33.656 --> 35:34.890
You shouldn't be fighting
with Ty,

35:34.958 --> 35:35.825
and you should go
to this dance!

35:35.892 --> 35:36.992
Why should I?

35:37.060 --> 35:38.227
Lou, he lied to me!

35:38.294 --> 35:39.628
You know, he said
that he went to bed early,

35:39.696 --> 35:40.662
but he didn't.
He was out late.

35:40.731 --> 35:41.831
So, where was he?

35:41.898 --> 35:43.265
Amy, he...

35:43.333 --> 35:45.499
This is my
End of School Formal, wha...

35:45.567 --> 35:48.036
I'm gonna go to it,
whether he does or not.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.370
Amy...

35:49.438 --> 35:50.371
What?

35:52.074 --> 35:53.208
Nothing.

36:01.249 --> 36:03.183
Peter, you have to stop.

36:03.251 --> 36:04.384
Stop what?

36:04.452 --> 36:05.786
I'm trying to get
this sauce right,

36:05.854 --> 36:06.987
and you're...
distracting me.

36:09.690 --> 36:11.058
Amy's upset,

36:11.126 --> 36:13.126
and I should have told her
about the dance lessons,

36:13.193 --> 36:14.594
but Ty made me promise
not to,

36:16.163 --> 36:17.930
Uh, hey!

36:17.998 --> 36:19.165
You're going!

36:19.233 --> 36:20.399
- Yeah!
- That's great!

36:20.467 --> 36:23.236
Look at you!
You look so adorable!

36:23.303 --> 36:24.804
Here, just...
Hold still.

36:24.872 --> 36:26.873
No. Lou, Lou, uh,
Lou, I got it.

36:26.940 --> 36:28.340
- Don't worry!
- It's fine!

36:28.408 --> 36:29.909
Just let her do it, Ty.
She's gonna do it anyway.

36:29.977 --> 36:31.910
Come on!

36:32.912 --> 36:33.912
Hi.

36:40.085 --> 36:41.286
You look great.

36:42.321 --> 36:43.088
Thank you.

36:44.257 --> 36:45.290
So do you.

36:49.094 --> 36:50.595
So, you're going.

36:50.663 --> 36:51.896
Uh, yeah.

36:52.431 --> 36:53.731
Of course.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.733
Okay.

36:57.002 --> 36:58.636
Okay.

36:59.538 --> 37:00.371
Oh! Wait!

37:00.439 --> 37:01.606
I need a picture of you two.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.874
<i>Pose, oh here.</i>

37:04.942 --> 37:06.576
Ready, and...

37:08.479 --> 37:09.346
Aw... cute!

37:10.782 --> 37:11.514
<i>Let me get one more.</i>

37:11.581 --> 37:13.015
Wait, Amy! Just...

37:16.520 --> 37:18.521
All right,
well, have fun!

37:30.533 --> 37:31.800
Okay!

37:33.068 --> 37:34.769
Down! Yeah, that's...
Yep! That's good!

37:34.837 --> 37:36.237
<i>That's good!</i>

37:41.910 --> 37:45.045
Well, I rescued it
from the scrap yard.

37:45.112 --> 37:47.214
It'll be good for parts one day.

37:47.281 --> 37:49.015
<i>Hey! Easy! Gentle!</i>

37:49.083 --> 37:50.718
<i>"Gentle!"</i>

37:50.785 --> 37:52.553
So, I took
the new truck back.

37:52.620 --> 37:55.188
<i>But I found another one
on the lot</i>

37:55.256 --> 37:58.925
that... well, I like
a whole lot better.

37:59.893 --> 38:01.126
This one.

38:01.594 --> 38:03.796
This one's a real beaut.

38:03.864 --> 38:05.364
A real honey,

38:05.431 --> 38:08.333
and it purrs
like a kitten.

38:08.401 --> 38:09.468
Mm-hm!

38:09.535 --> 38:11.336
Just like a kitten.

38:38.663 --> 38:40.463
My trailer now!

38:42.600 --> 38:43.834
Oh!

38:47.738 --> 38:48.437
Hey! Hey!

38:51.842 --> 38:53.442
What the hell are you doing

38:53.510 --> 38:54.610
are you crazy?

38:56.446 --> 38:57.646
Are you?

38:57.714 --> 38:59.348
I'm taking back
what's mine!

38:59.416 --> 39:01.550
What's yours?

39:03.287 --> 39:04.252
Why aren't you at the dance?

39:04.320 --> 39:05.720
What does it matter?

39:05.788 --> 39:07.355
Look what you've done!
You're wrecking your trailer!

39:07.423 --> 39:08.857
Oh, oh, so now
that it's wrecked,

39:08.925 --> 39:09.858
it's suddenly become
my trailer?

39:09.926 --> 39:11.626
Oh!
You are such an idiot!

39:11.694 --> 39:12.727
And you're a spoiled
little brat!

39:12.795 --> 39:14.162
Well, at least
I'm not an idiot!

39:14.230 --> 39:16.131
I want my trailer back!

39:16.199 --> 39:17.565
Well, I happen to be
living here!

39:17.633 --> 39:19.034
Well, why don't you get your
butt home where you belong!

39:19.101 --> 39:20.801
Don't you tell me
where my butt belongs!

39:20.869 --> 39:22.336
Well, it's about time
somebody did!

39:22.403 --> 39:23.270
Yeah, well
you're the last person

39:23.338 --> 39:24.771
I need to tell me anything!

39:46.560 --> 39:47.894
Sorry I'm late.

39:47.962 --> 39:49.495
I was like...

39:52.665 --> 39:54.833
Looking for a house!

39:54.901 --> 39:56.701
A house?

39:58.304 --> 40:00.638
He was looking for a house!

40:03.376 --> 40:07.379
Are you uh... ready to go?

40:12.717 --> 40:13.817
You go.

40:14.819 --> 40:16.087
I'll prop this up,

40:16.154 --> 40:19.623
<i>and fix the leak,
like I said I would.</i>

40:22.361 --> 40:25.461
Ash...
You can stay if you want.

40:26.964 --> 40:28.265
It's fine.

41:09.065 --> 41:10.799
Look at them,
aren't they adorable?

41:10.867 --> 41:12.234
Let me see!

41:12.301 --> 41:14.603
Oh, look at them.

41:15.671 --> 41:18.373
Where'd she get
that dress?

41:18.741 --> 41:19.808
Oh, and I can tell
you now.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.843
I gave Ty dance lessons.

41:21.911 --> 41:23.210
Dance lessons?

41:23.278 --> 41:24.779
Yeah, dance lessons.

41:24.847 --> 41:26.380
Well, must be love.

41:26.449 --> 41:29.483
You know what?
I propose a toast!

41:29.551 --> 41:30.717
To...

41:30.785 --> 41:32.252
<i>To, uh...</i>

41:33.621 --> 41:35.288
To new beginnings.

41:36.624 --> 41:37.624
To new beginnings.

41:38.860 --> 41:41.194
Great. No signal.

41:41.262 --> 41:44.964
You know what? It's almost like
you willed this to happen.

41:45.031 --> 41:46.632
- Now, why would I do that?
- Oh, I don't know, Ty.

41:46.700 --> 41:49.068
Maybe 'cause you didn't
wanna go!

41:49.135 --> 41:50.770
Okay, you're right.

41:50.838 --> 41:51.804
I didn't want to go.

41:51.872 --> 41:53.739
I know. You don't have
to tell me!

41:53.807 --> 41:57.009
But not because I didn't
wanna be with you, Amy!

41:57.077 --> 41:59.445
Because I do.

41:59.513 --> 42:02.948
You're the only one
I wanna be with.

42:06.452 --> 42:07.619
Come're.

42:07.687 --> 42:09.020
Ty...

42:09.088 --> 42:10.188
Come on.

42:14.727 --> 42:15.927
- Hold on.
- Ty, Ty!

42:19.163 --> 42:20.297
Ty, what're you doing?

42:20.365 --> 42:21.799
<i>Look.</i>

42:21.867 --> 42:23.667
I'm sorry, okay?

42:24.903 --> 42:26.103
And I'm not much
good at this,

42:26.170 --> 42:27.505
so don't laugh.

42:27.572 --> 42:31.509
But if we were where
we're supposed to be, then...

42:31.576 --> 42:35.044
I'd be asking you
to dance right now.

42:37.180 --> 42:38.982
So?

42:39.049 --> 42:40.216
Do you wanna dance?

42:41.752 --> 42:43.352
You can dance?

42:51.628 --> 42:53.729
Okay, you can dance.

42:55.798 --> 42:57.533
I got something
for you.

42:57.600 --> 42:58.466
It took me
a few trips into town

42:58.535 --> 43:00.402
to get what I wanted,

43:00.469 --> 43:02.370
hope you like it.

43:04.940 --> 43:05.907
Ty...

43:07.108 --> 43:08.175
Open it!

43:09.511 --> 43:10.477
Ty!

43:11.680 --> 43:13.414
A promise ring?

43:14.482 --> 43:15.583
Is it okay?

43:15.651 --> 43:18.118
Yes, it's okay!

43:21.055 --> 43:21.855
- Like it?
- Yes!

43:24.525 --> 43:26.192
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43:30.130 --> 43:31.330
Do you kids
need any help?

43:31.398 --> 43:32.566
No.

43:32.633 --> 43:34.935
We're good.
