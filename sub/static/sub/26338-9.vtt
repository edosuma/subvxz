00:02.089 --> 00:06.006
JACK:
Scooby, come here. Hi.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.486
You want to come here
and give me that key?

00:08.530 --> 00:10.662
Come on.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.229
I don't think
he likes you.

00:12.273 --> 00:14.014
You know, this does, uh,

00:14.057 --> 00:16.103
remind me, though,
of that, uh...

00:16.146 --> 00:18.801
that jungle ride.
You remember that?No.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
It's the pirate ride.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.674
The jungle ride is the one
you're no longer allowed on.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.894
That animatronic hippo mishap,

00:24.937 --> 00:26.591
that was...
that was not my fault.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.636
You sunk the boat.

00:27.679 --> 00:28.898
Yeah, whatever.
They overreacted.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.421
Wasn't that big of a deal.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.815
And, you know, I always thought
pirates were pretty cool--

00:32.858 --> 00:34.686
like, Captain Hook
was my favorite character--

00:34.730 --> 00:36.297
but in reality,

00:36.340 --> 00:38.429
they kind of suck.At least we can agree
on one thing.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.344
They rigged this thing
with enough explosives

00:40.388 --> 00:42.042
to blow us away even if I try

00:42.085 --> 00:44.348
to pick it
or shake any of these loose.

00:45.828 --> 00:48.004
I got this.

00:52.139 --> 00:55.664
What dog worth his salt

00:55.707 --> 00:58.101
could resist...

00:58.145 --> 01:02.279
a nice, juicy cow bone?

01:02.323 --> 01:04.281
You're gonna be real upset
when you realize what that is.

01:04.325 --> 01:05.717
Lion bone. Yeah, whatever.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.546
The only lions in
Slovenia are in zoos.

01:08.590 --> 01:11.114
This human

01:11.158 --> 01:13.595
Well, there's a tool for
every job, I guess.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.292
Hey, boy, you hungry?

01:15.336 --> 01:17.773
How about a nice, juicy...

01:17.816 --> 01:20.428
human leg bone.

01:20.471 --> 01:21.690
Come on, boy.

01:21.733 --> 01:22.908
You know, this could've been us.

01:22.952 --> 01:23.953
Still could be.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.433
I'm gonna think positive.

01:25.476 --> 01:27.217
Come on, boy. How
can you resist?

01:27.261 --> 01:28.914
Huh? Look.

01:28.958 --> 01:30.829
Yes.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.744
I told you I could
talk to animals.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.138
We can't reach that.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.792
Can you... can you whip up
some go-go-gadget arms

01:36.835 --> 01:37.836
or something right now?

01:39.882 --> 01:41.840
Actually, yeah. Yeah, I can.

01:41.884 --> 01:42.798
I can.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.810
Nice.Yeah.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.119
:
You got it.

02:02.296 --> 02:03.949
Easy.

02:03.993 --> 02:05.255
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:05.299 --> 02:07.388
Bad doggy. Bad dog.Come back.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.259
Don't you want
your juicy bone?

and organizing.

04:47.461 --> 04:49.332
Oh, cleaning and organizing.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.247
Okay, good, good.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.293
If it's so organized, then, uh,

04:53.336 --> 04:55.207
how come I can't
find my sandwich?

04:55.251 --> 04:56.948
You mean the soggy thing
in the foil?

04:56.992 --> 04:59.864
Oh, please don't tell me
you threw out my sandwich.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.476
Yeah. It was, like,
a month old, Jack.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.565
No, it... No, it wasn't.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.958
It was-- anyway--
marinating.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.787
How you holding up

05:09.831 --> 05:11.789
Good.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.923
I can do this all day.

05:14.966 --> 05:17.099
Oh, my gosh, that's so funny,
'cause so could I.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.365
Sushi it is.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.063
That's all right.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.151
Hey, Mac, come here
for a second.Yeah.

05:26.195 --> 05:27.152
Come here, come here.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.893
Yeah?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.637
Okay...

05:33.681 --> 05:36.858
I don't want to overstep
my bounds here, okay,

05:36.901 --> 05:39.382
but you-you know I love Leanna,
I really do,

05:39.426 --> 05:41.341
but... what's going on?

05:41.384 --> 05:42.994
If it's about the sandwich,
we'll get you another one.No, who cares

05:43.038 --> 05:44.300
about the sandwich?
It's not about the sandwich.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.997
It starts with
cleaning the fridge.

05:46.041 --> 05:48.696
Then she's
cleaning the kitchen.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.350
Then, next thing you know...

05:50.393 --> 05:52.134
she's cleaning the whole house.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.744
You see where
I'm going with this?

05:53.788 --> 05:55.529
You're worried she's gonna
clean the whole house?

05:55.572 --> 05:57.966
No, no. Clean-clean
houses are very cool,

05:58.009 --> 06:00.795
but next thing you know,
you're sitting on the couch,

06:00.838 --> 06:02.274
and you're watching
daytime soaps,

06:02.318 --> 06:04.364
covered in pink throw pillows.

06:04.407 --> 06:06.191
Is that the kind
of change you want, huh?

06:06.235 --> 06:08.193
You want little bowls
of potpourri everywhere?

06:08.237 --> 06:10.805
Between me and you,
I like potpourri.Who doesn't love potpourri?

06:10.848 --> 06:12.023
But...

06:12.067 --> 06:13.373
BOZER:
I don't buy that for a second.

06:13.416 --> 06:17.246
I'm afraid
she's gonna change everything.

06:17.289 --> 06:19.596
MacGYVER:
Jack, you're acting weird again.

06:22.469 --> 06:25.167
It's Matty. She wants us mobile.
We'll be briefed mid-flight.

06:25.210 --> 06:26.951
Good, good.
Yeah, we'll be right there.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.692
Okay, that's fine, we'll go.

06:28.736 --> 06:29.911
But listen, listen--

06:29.954 --> 06:31.695
we'll just put
this conversation on pause

06:31.739 --> 06:33.480
until after we save the world.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.872
Glad your priorities
are in order.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.439
Promise, after,
by the way.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.440
Right, after, after.

06:37.484 --> 06:39.050
There's a real life lesson here.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.096
MATTY: Well, I've got
a different one for you today.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.359
The CDC is asking for help

06:43.403 --> 06:45.709
The Center of Disease
Control needs us?

06:45.753 --> 06:47.276
Well, that can't be good.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.234
They're keeping the details
under wraps.

06:49.278 --> 06:52.499
All they'll say is they have
an inventory discrepancy.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.110
An inventory discrepancy.
So, they lost something.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.895
Oh, man, this has zombie
apocalypse written all over it.

06:57.939 --> 07:00.985
Jack, you are about to meet
with some of our country's

07:01.029 --> 07:02.726
most highly intelligent,

07:02.770 --> 07:04.075
highly trained scientists.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.730
Please, try not to say
anything stupid.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.036
BOZER:
Normally, I'd agree
with you, Matty,

07:08.079 --> 07:09.603
but I think if anyone's
gonna want to talk

07:09.646 --> 07:12.127
about the zombie apocalypse,
it's gonna be the CDC.

07:12.170 --> 07:13.998
MATTY:
Go assist and report back.

07:14.042 --> 07:17.393
If they're asking for help,
something serious is going on.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.134
Yes, ma'am.

07:22.616 --> 07:25.009
WOMAN:
Thank you for coming.

07:25.053 --> 07:27.272
I'd appreciate you keeping
the reason for this visit

07:27.316 --> 07:28.578
under wraps.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.275
Of course.
Um, happy to help,

07:30.319 --> 07:31.799
although all we've been
told so far is

07:31.842 --> 07:33.148
you have an inventory
discrepancy.

07:33.191 --> 07:35.455
Yesterday, we discovered
a cryotube was missing

07:35.498 --> 07:39.241
from the cold storage unit in
our level-four biosafety lab.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.634
BOZER:
Just to be clear,

07:40.677 --> 07:42.200
level four is where
the big boys live.

07:42.244 --> 07:45.900
If by "big boys" you mean
diseases with no cure, then yes.

07:45.943 --> 07:49.947
The missing agent is a strain
of a particularly deadly virus.

07:49.991 --> 07:51.949
Mm-hmm. What kind of virus
are we talking about here, Doc?

07:51.993 --> 07:53.821
Solanum
What do we got?

07:53.864 --> 07:55.562
Those aren't even real.Not yet, they're not.

07:55.605 --> 07:59.087
We call it Specimen 234.
It spreads fast,

07:59.130 --> 08:01.002
like the flu, but with
a 99% mortality rate.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.960
If it got into the population,

08:03.004 --> 08:05.223
we'd be looking at a pandemic.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.442
Millions would die.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.531
Has anything like this
happened before?

08:08.575 --> 08:10.272
We've had discrepancies
in the past,

08:10.315 --> 08:12.970
but nothing this deadly
has been missing this long.

08:13.014 --> 08:16.321
Misplaced samples are
usually found within hours

08:16.365 --> 08:18.062
in another storage unit or lab,

08:18.106 --> 08:20.543
but we're having a hard time
tracking this one down.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.067
So, it's in the building,
it's just playing hide and seek.

08:23.111 --> 08:26.288
We believe Specimen 234
went missing

08:26.331 --> 08:28.072
during an incident
in the lab yesterday.

08:28.116 --> 08:30.379
An incident.

08:30.422 --> 08:33.774
You do know that's how
horror movies start, right?

08:33.817 --> 08:34.862
Nothing so dramatic.

08:34.905 --> 08:35.950
It's one of the
containment units

08:35.993 --> 08:38.996
holding some
experimental subjects

08:39.040 --> 08:40.302
wasn't latched correctly.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.739
Well, we've passed over
a dozen security cameras

08:42.783 --> 08:44.219
since we passed through
the lobby,

08:44.262 --> 08:46.047
I'm assuming you have
some footage you can show us?

08:55.665 --> 08:57.145
So, the infected rats of Nimh

08:57.188 --> 08:58.929
escaped their cage.

08:58.973 --> 09:01.802
Yes. But we took every
necessary precaution

09:01.845 --> 09:04.979
to contain the subjects
and decontaminate the lab.

09:05.022 --> 09:06.589
It wasn't until
four hours later

09:06.633 --> 09:08.460
we discovered 234's absence.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.724
So you think that
the virus was misplaced

09:10.767 --> 09:12.639
during the chaos and confusion
of the clean

09:12.682 --> 09:14.162
Yes.

09:14.205 --> 09:18.166
Gentlemen, I need 234 found
quickly and quietly.

09:18.209 --> 09:20.560
If word got out a level-four
bioagent was missing,

09:20.603 --> 09:22.083
it would cause mass panic.

09:22.126 --> 09:23.737
BOZER:
I'd like to go through
the security footage.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.869
Look for anything
your team may have missed.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.654
Yeah, Jack and I would like
to inspect the lab.

09:27.697 --> 09:28.655
We would?

09:28.698 --> 09:30.221
Uh, we want to go
to the place

09:30.265 --> 09:31.919
where all the super viruses
hang out?

09:31.962 --> 09:33.616
That's where we want to go?Yes.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.400
I'm going to assume

09:35.444 --> 09:36.706
that the level-four lab

09:36.750 --> 09:39.579
would require a security card
to access, yes?

09:39.622 --> 09:41.624
Every lab requires
a security card.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
You can't get anywhere in the
building without clearance.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.149
I suggest we get started.

09:45.193 --> 09:48.152
Getting you in is going
to be a bit of a process.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.111
Street clothes
are swapped for scrubs

09:50.154 --> 09:53.157
to avoid carrying
any contaminants into the lab.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.551
Anyone looking to access
level four

09:55.595 --> 09:58.249
must put on
a positive pressure suit.

09:58.293 --> 09:59.599
Every scientist has their own.

09:59.642 --> 10:01.078
Before exiting the suit room,

10:01.122 --> 10:04.255
each suit is thoroughly
examined for rips or tears.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.822
MacGYVER: What happens
if you find a hole?

10:05.866 --> 10:07.389
DOCTOR: If it's small,
the scientist will log it

10:07.432 --> 10:08.608
and cover it with duct tape.

10:08.651 --> 10:10.348
Anything larger than
half an inch,

10:10.392 --> 10:11.741
and the scientist either
has to submit the suit

10:11.785 --> 10:15.223
for permanent repair
or request a new one.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.402
And here we go.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.362
You'll need to plug
into this.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.583
Nothing's been touched

10:27.627 --> 10:30.412
since we discovered
Specimen 234 was missing.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.502
So, every scientist
who has access to this lab

10:33.545 --> 10:35.286
can also get
into the cold storage unit

10:35.330 --> 10:37.027
where 234 was being kept?

10:37.071 --> 10:39.116
Yes, but we already interviewed
the four scientists

10:39.160 --> 10:41.379
who were in the lab
when the rats escaped.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.512
None of them were working
on that flu strain.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.818
When's the last time somebody

10:44.861 --> 10:46.820
did work with it?Four days ago.

10:46.863 --> 10:50.606
But the cryotube was returned
to cold storage that same day.

10:56.568 --> 11:00.181
Could you, uh, read me the
details on the incident report?

11:00.224 --> 11:02.226
Sure.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.533
Six test subjects

11:04.576 --> 11:07.710
were found loose
on the examination table

11:07.754 --> 11:09.712
at 12:37 p.m. yesterday.

11:09.756 --> 11:10.713
After that.

11:10.757 --> 11:11.932
Clear liquid was found

11:11.975 --> 11:13.716
pooled on the table near

11:13.760 --> 11:16.066
the cage door. Uh,
testing revealed it

11:16.110 --> 11:17.720
to be 100% glycerol.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.548
It's a common product
used in the lab.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.725
The spill was determined
to be unrelated.

11:22.769 --> 11:23.726
What are you thinking, Mac?

11:23.770 --> 11:26.163
I'm not sure yet.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.470
What are the lab's
exit procedures?

11:31.429 --> 11:33.518
How long do we have to do this?

11:33.562 --> 11:35.520
Everyone exiting level four
is required

11:35.564 --> 11:37.827
to take a seven-minute
chemical shower.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.177
You know, if a scientist was
carrying something out of here

11:40.221 --> 11:41.962
that he shouldn't be,
that camera would definitely

11:42.005 --> 11:43.267
catch it.

11:43.311 --> 11:44.442
DOCTOR:
I checked the footage.

11:44.486 --> 11:47.010
No one exited the lab
holding a cryotube.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.713
What are you
looking for now?

11:59.283 --> 12:01.285
This.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.553
Duct tape residue.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.382
Well, as I explained before,
our scientists use duct tape

12:11.426 --> 12:13.733
to patch small tears
in their suits.

12:13.776 --> 12:16.648
I don't see a tear
anywhere near that residue.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.563
So why would someone
put duct tape on it?

12:18.607 --> 12:20.565
Whose suit
is this?

12:20.609 --> 12:22.002
It's a guest suit.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.351
It's not assigned to a doctor.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.787
Interesting.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.789
What are the rest of
the exit procedures from here?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.269
Anyone
exiting the lab

12:28.312 --> 12:30.793
would take another shower,
put on their street clothes,

12:30.837 --> 12:32.708
and then be free
to leave the facility.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.797
Dr. Falama,
I have bad news.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.408
Your virus was not
mistakenly misplaced.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.584
This was
a well-orchestrated heist.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.673
Someone Ocean
Eleven'edthe virus.

12:41.717 --> 12:44.285
Getting a level-four bioagent
out of the building

12:44.328 --> 12:46.026
would be impossible.

12:46.069 --> 12:47.505
Nothing is impossible.

12:47.549 --> 12:50.508
Someone with BSL-4 access
entered the cold storage

12:50.552 --> 12:52.336
and used their body to block

12:52.380 --> 12:54.295
the surveillance camera
across the room.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.297
They then removed a cryotube
of the virus

12:56.340 --> 12:59.300
and hid it beneath a piece
of duct tape on their suit.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.215
The spilled glycerol was,
in fact,

13:01.258 --> 13:03.391
the most clever step
in this heist.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.220
Your thief replaced the lock
on the rat cage

13:06.263 --> 13:08.004
with a frozen rod of glycerol.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.615
FALAMA:
Why would they do that? Because the glycerol would take

13:10.659 --> 13:12.617
about 30 minutes to melt,

13:12.661 --> 13:14.619
giving this person more
than enough time to make it

13:14.663 --> 13:16.796
through all
of the lab's exit procedures.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.842
Your thief used the rats
as a time-delay distraction.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.104
They would've been clear
of the lab before

13:21.148 --> 13:23.106
any rodent-related
emergency procedures began,

13:23.150 --> 13:24.325
giving them
plenty of time

13:24.368 --> 13:26.327
before anyone noticed
the missing virus.

13:26.370 --> 13:29.330
I think it's time we looked
at your security footage.

13:30.374 --> 13:31.898
Uh, Boze,

13:31.941 --> 13:34.291
take us to ten minutes
before the lab was shut down.

13:34.335 --> 13:35.858
FALAMA:
Okay, say you're right

13:35.902 --> 13:37.251
and my bio-agent was stolen.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.253
A virus needs to be kept frozen
to remain viable.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.602
Anyone working here
would know that.

13:40.645 --> 13:41.821
So even
if they got it out

13:41.864 --> 13:43.997
of the lab, how would
they transport it?

13:44.040 --> 13:45.868
Stop.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.304
Zoom in on
the upper left.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.872
That's how. Fill one
of those containers

13:49.916 --> 13:51.134
with liquid nitrogen,
you have yourself

13:51.178 --> 13:53.745
an improvised traveling
cold storage unit.

13:53.789 --> 13:55.530
That's Dr. Luca.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.488
But he would never
do something like this.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.273
MacGYVER:
Except he just did.

13:59.316 --> 14:01.014
It's like you said-- if we
don't find this virus fast,

14:01.057 --> 14:02.058
millions of people will die.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.331
MATTY:
Safe to say a deadly virus

14:14.375 --> 14:15.942
escaping the CDC

14:15.985 --> 14:18.901
was not the situation I was
hoping you were walking into.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.685
Any idea where Luca is?

14:20.729 --> 14:23.079
Credit cards show
no activity of any kind

14:23.123 --> 14:24.559
after his disappearance.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.388
However, Luca did make
some pretty hefty withdrawals

14:27.431 --> 14:30.913
from his savings account in the
days leading up to the theft.

14:30.957 --> 14:32.915
Sounds like a guy prepping
to drop off the grid

14:32.959 --> 14:35.962
and do God knows what.
How do we find him?

14:36.005 --> 14:38.268
MacGYVER:
Luca's vacuum container trick--
it would only work

14:38.312 --> 14:40.967
for three hours, tops,
so if he wanted the virus

14:41.010 --> 14:42.969
to remain viable,
he'd have to store it properly.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.971
I think we should run a search
for any biocontainment

14:45.014 --> 14:47.147
cold storage units
that have sold recently.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.365
Well, there can't be
that many people

14:48.409 --> 14:50.019
in the market for one of those.

14:50.063 --> 14:52.108
I mean, not like it's the next
Game of Thronesbook.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.676
Jack Dalton read
Game of Thrones

14:54.719 --> 14:57.635
You don't have to read a book
to know it's popular, Bozer.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.202
Okay, got something.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.335
A Canadian medical company
shipped a cold storage freezer

15:01.378 --> 15:02.945
to an address
in Columbia, South Carolina

15:02.989 --> 15:04.642
a week before
the virus was stolen.

15:04.686 --> 15:06.079
Okay. That's where we're going.

15:06.122 --> 15:11.475
♪ Streetlights, people

15:11.519 --> 15:14.435
♪ Living just to find emotion,
hiding... ♪

15:14.478 --> 15:16.219
:
Oh...

15:16.263 --> 15:21.137
♪ Somewhere in the night...

15:21.181 --> 15:22.182
Oh, my gosh.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.535
What? This song's a classic.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.364
Um, the original is a classic.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.975
What you just did do it,
I-I don't know about that.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.585
Imagine what Journey would say

15:34.629 --> 15:36.674
if they found out
you stopped believin'.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.850
And when your dad
and I were at lunch...

15:38.894 --> 15:40.852
Whoa, whoa. Time out.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.985
You-you and Elwood
went to lunch?

15:43.029 --> 15:44.508
He called me.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.597
He wanted to know the guy
that's dating his daughter.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.730
And I know you guys

15:48.773 --> 15:51.602
have issues,
but he loves you.

15:51.646 --> 15:55.650
And he's
super protective.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.260
And it was at that lunch
that I found out

15:57.304 --> 15:59.741
he used to sing
this song to you as a baby.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.612
Elwood told you that?

16:01.656 --> 16:03.614
Yeah. And a few other things.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.007
Like what?

16:05.051 --> 16:08.271
How he thinks that
family is very important.

16:08.315 --> 16:10.970
Oh. That doesn't sound
like my father.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.928
Well, your dad's a changed man.

16:12.972 --> 16:16.323
Family is everything
to him now.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.977
Better late than never, right?

16:18.020 --> 16:20.501
So what else did he say?

16:20.544 --> 16:21.806
A lot.

16:21.850 --> 16:24.200
It was a long lunch.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.723
We got into your relationship,

16:25.767 --> 16:27.899
his regrets.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.902
You know, I'm glad that
you're giving him a chance.

16:30.946 --> 16:34.341
Yeah, me, too.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.391
What are you doing?

16:41.435 --> 16:43.828
Don't worry, I'm not working.
I'm just checking in with Matty.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.613
She's
not gonna answer.

16:45.656 --> 16:47.180
And how do you know that?

16:47.223 --> 16:48.746
I know.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.444
I had my mama
call her last week.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.141
She told her I was
hoping to spend

16:52.185 --> 16:54.100
some quality time
off the grid with you.

16:54.143 --> 16:57.059
So unless the world's ending
and she needs some extra hands,

16:57.103 --> 16:58.930
you're all mine.

16:58.974 --> 17:01.020
This cannot get any better.

17:01.063 --> 17:02.847
Oh, but it will.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.284
And how is that?

17:04.327 --> 17:07.939
I got a surprise for you
at the end of the trip.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.898
You're not gonna propose,
are you?

17:09.941 --> 17:11.900
No.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.120
I like how things are going.

17:14.163 --> 17:15.730
Yeah, me, too.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.909
Looks like the best barbecue
is only three miles ahead.

17:20.952 --> 17:22.650
I'm from Louisiana.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.435
I'm not gonna let a statement
like that go unchallenged.

17:25.479 --> 17:27.176
Oh, wow.

17:27.220 --> 17:28.656
Ooh.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.659
Whose idea was
the meat

17:31.702 --> 17:32.964
Yours. It had to be.No...

17:33.008 --> 17:35.228
I'd never suggest
anything so cruel.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.882
I feel like my whole body's
rubbed in spice.

17:41.973 --> 17:44.889
Where the hell is our car?

17:50.286 --> 17:52.810
So, Bozer.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.986
Leanna sure has been
hanging out a lot, huh?

17:55.030 --> 17:56.684
:
Don't do this right now.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.294
Yeah, she has.
She's my girlfriend,

17:58.338 --> 17:59.774
and I like hanging out with her.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.037
Word. No, she
really seems to be

18:02.081 --> 18:03.430
just settling right in.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.518
BOZER:
I'm sorry,

18:04.561 --> 18:05.997
do you have a problem
with my girl

18:06.041 --> 18:08.913
coming over to my house
where I live and you don't?

18:08.957 --> 18:10.872
Why would I have a problem
with that? No, I think, I think

18:10.915 --> 18:13.831
the fridge looks great,
organized and labeled and...

18:13.875 --> 18:16.704
you know exactly where
everything is in there.

18:16.747 --> 18:17.966
I must be missing something.

18:18.009 --> 18:19.794
Jack, what the hell
are you talking about?

18:19.837 --> 18:21.665
My sandwich.What?

18:21.709 --> 18:23.624
Who cares about a sandwich?When I put a sandwich in there,

18:23.667 --> 18:25.974
I expect it to be there...I think we can all agree

18:26.017 --> 18:27.323
that right now is not
the time for this.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.890
What's the address, Bozer?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.544
8866.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.763
8866. Okay.

18:32.807 --> 18:35.766
Next... building?

18:35.810 --> 18:37.812
Or not.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.777
What, the, uh, doctor
had the cold storage unit

18:46.821 --> 18:48.823
delivered to a parking lot?

18:48.866 --> 18:50.651
So this is a dead end.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.261
Maybe not.

18:52.305 --> 18:54.916
You could definitely install
a cold storage unit in an RV.

18:54.959 --> 18:57.005
Really?Yeah. I think we just
found his mobile lab.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.138
JACK: We did?Matty said Luca had
a bunch of withdrawals

18:59.181 --> 19:01.314
from his savings in the days
leading up to the theft.

19:01.357 --> 19:02.880
Well, that would make sense.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.969
Paying for this RV
in cash would

19:05.013 --> 19:06.841
keep him off the radar.

19:08.277 --> 19:10.888
Matty says she's got a satellite
on our position.

19:10.932 --> 19:13.891
And thermal imaging confirms
no heat signatures inside.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.503
So our doctor isn't in there,
but the stolen virus might be.

19:16.546 --> 19:18.461
Which is exactly why I don't
think it's such a good idea

19:18.505 --> 19:19.680
for us just to go

19:19.723 --> 19:20.768
charging in there
right now.

19:20.811 --> 19:22.161
Agreed. There is no way

19:22.204 --> 19:24.250
that old beat-up RV has
the level of biocontainment

19:24.293 --> 19:26.208
this virus requires.Mm-mm.

19:26.252 --> 19:28.341
Yeah. The interior may be
completely contaminated,

19:28.384 --> 19:30.908
but we don't have time
to wait for a hazmat team.

19:30.952 --> 19:32.867
So put your big boy pants on
'cause we're going in.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.199
Definitely Luca's lab.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.250
But the virus isn't here.

20:08.294 --> 20:09.904
BOZER: Guys, I got a pile
of something here.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.906
I think it's been burned.Oh, yeah.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.256
This is definitely a burn bag.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.432
What's that?

20:16.476 --> 20:18.129
MacGYVER: Looks like it was
Luca's passport.

20:18.173 --> 20:19.827
His passport?

20:19.870 --> 20:21.872
So-so it's possible
that the good doctor now has

20:21.916 --> 20:23.439
a new name and identity?

20:23.483 --> 20:25.746
Should we
even be in here?

20:25.789 --> 20:29.053
Bozer, my skin looking clammy?

20:29.097 --> 20:31.055
A little.What about around the eyes?

20:31.099 --> 20:33.144
Oh, terrible.Seriously?

20:33.188 --> 20:35.103
All right. Stop talking.
And you're fine.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.496
And stop egging him on.

20:36.539 --> 20:37.540
I feel a little woozy.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.372
Okay, what's that, now?

20:43.416 --> 20:45.983
It's a... it's a burned vial.

20:46.027 --> 20:48.116
A burned vial?
That's-that's good.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.944
Maybe he burned the virus,
had a change of heart,

20:49.987 --> 20:50.901
we got nothing to worry about.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.034
Guys, I got a laptop over here.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.775
Too bad Riley's off
road-tripping with Billy.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.994
We could really use
her boopity-boop skills
right about now.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.692
Actually, it's not asking

20:58.735 --> 21:01.956
for a password,
and it's open to a video.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.611
To whoever finds this,

21:04.654 --> 21:06.787
I want you to know that...

21:06.830 --> 21:09.050
I am sorry
for what I'm about to do.

21:09.093 --> 21:11.139
I hope I will be forgiven

21:11.182 --> 21:13.707
when the truth comes out.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.710
Geofri...

21:16.753 --> 21:19.930
I'm coming home.

21:19.974 --> 21:22.063
Who's Geofri?According to his file,

21:22.106 --> 21:23.978
Geofri is his brother
back in Romania.

21:24.021 --> 21:27.895
So Luca wants to go
to Romania to do what,

21:27.938 --> 21:31.638
bond with his brother over
releasing a deadly viral plague?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.640
Can't be that.
Geofri died in a mining accident

21:33.683 --> 21:35.903
a few months ago-- safe to say
Luca's going to Romania,

21:35.946 --> 21:36.991
but no clue why.

21:37.034 --> 21:38.122
Guys.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.130
He wasn't using this
to burn the virus.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.480
He was preparing.

21:47.523 --> 21:49.656
And that's the start
of the zombie apocalypse.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.135
Good day, gentlemen.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.094
Jack, relax. There's
a 24-hour incubation period

21:53.137 --> 21:56.489
between when the subject becomes
infected and then contagious.

21:56.532 --> 21:57.794
How am I supposed to relax?

21:57.838 --> 22:01.189
We got less than a day
to find this Luca dude

22:01.232 --> 22:03.496
and keep him
from being patient zero

22:03.539 --> 22:06.760
in an epidemic
that will kill millions.Not if we get

22:06.803 --> 22:08.109
to Romania first and find him.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.510
Well, Officer
Couldn't Care Less

22:17.553 --> 22:19.338
isn't gonna lift
a finger to help.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.556
Yeah, no kidding.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.167
I'm gonna see if I
can get us a flight home.

22:23.211 --> 22:24.778
What? What are you
talking about?

22:24.821 --> 22:26.606
Well... Billy,
we have no car,

22:26.649 --> 22:28.651
we have nothing
but what we have on us,

22:28.695 --> 22:30.740
and we're stuck
in the middle of
Arizona somewhere.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.786
So we improvise.

22:32.829 --> 22:35.876
That's what Mac
would do, right?

22:35.919 --> 22:37.399
So you want to build a car?

22:37.443 --> 22:39.880
No, I was thinking
more like ride-share.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.534
To Dallas?

22:41.577 --> 22:42.839
Well, why not?

22:42.883 --> 22:44.841
It'll be a part
of the adventure.

22:44.885 --> 22:47.888
And trust me, you don't want
to miss your surprise.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.411
Okay.

22:49.455 --> 22:51.848
BILLY:
Huh, look at that.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.981
A ride a half
a mile away.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.767
Done. Easy.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.945
What are you smiling about?

23:01.989 --> 23:03.860
I'm just thinking about
the look on your face

23:03.904 --> 23:05.471
when you see your surprise.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.388
Did you see that?

23:10.258 --> 23:12.608
I do now.

23:12.652 --> 23:14.305
Hey, are you Billy?

23:14.349 --> 23:15.611
Follow that Bentley.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.396
AI got a five-
star rating.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.747
And...

23:20.790 --> 23:22.966
and 67 bucks
if you don't lose that car.Okay.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.854
All right. A glowing review
is in your future.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.860
Well, this is clearly
a chop shop.

23:46.903 --> 23:48.818
Not like we can knock
on the door and politely ask

23:48.862 --> 23:50.820
for the car back.
Should we call the cops?

23:50.864 --> 23:52.300
: Yeah, right.
Flagstaff's finest

23:52.343 --> 23:54.258
took two hours to
file their report.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.782
By the time the
police gets here,

23:55.825 --> 23:57.740
that car'll be
in a million pieces.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.873
All right, so if
the boys in blue are out,

23:59.916 --> 24:01.222
what's the plan?

24:02.136 --> 24:04.617
We steal our car back.

24:05.661 --> 24:08.185
Good plan.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.676
MacGYVER:
Okay, Matty, bad news.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.070
By the time the search
for Luca began in Romania,

24:23.113 --> 24:25.507
he had already deplaned,
and no one I've spoken to here

24:25.551 --> 24:27.596
remembers even seeing him
in the first place.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.511
Any luck with
the surveillance footage?

24:29.555 --> 24:31.208
Not really. We tracked Luca
through the airport

24:31.252 --> 24:32.819
after he got off the plane,

24:32.862 --> 24:34.777
but then we lost him in the
crowd near the main entrance.

24:34.821 --> 24:35.952
We're still searching
the footage,

24:35.996 --> 24:37.432
but it's as if he
just disappeared.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.913
Hey. Mac, so, we recalled

24:39.956 --> 24:42.568
all the taxis that
worked the airport today,
questioned the drivers,

24:42.611 --> 24:45.048
showed them Luca's picture,
but nobody remembers seeing him.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.702
It's like he
got into Romania

24:46.746 --> 24:48.617
and just...Disappeared; that's what
Leanna said.

24:48.661 --> 24:50.271
But here's the thing,

24:50.314 --> 24:52.491
he had to have gone
somewhere, right?

25:05.068 --> 25:06.896
Guess he's not hiding in there.

25:09.595 --> 25:13.468
Okay, hey, hey, we making a mess
just to make a mess, or what?

25:13.512 --> 25:15.557
No, no. There's got to be...

25:15.601 --> 25:18.081
something here.

25:27.047 --> 25:29.571
Bingo.No way.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.531
Is that a bag of hair?

25:32.574 --> 25:34.663
Luca changed his appearance--
that's how he disappeared.

25:34.707 --> 25:37.753
Okay, well, that means we've
been showing a bunch of cabbies

25:37.797 --> 25:40.321
an outdated photo.
What's he look like now?No idea.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.541
But I think
I know how to find him.

25:42.584 --> 25:43.977
Did you release the cabbies yet?

25:44.020 --> 25:45.674
No. They're still
lined up outside.

25:45.718 --> 25:46.980
What are you thinking?

25:47.023 --> 25:50.505
We, uh, we need to go
to the grocery store.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.334
Got everything you asked for,

25:53.377 --> 25:54.901
including the hot plate
and the pot.

26:08.610 --> 26:10.177
You're making something
out of horse radish

26:10.220 --> 26:11.613
that'll glow?
Now that's kind of hard

26:11.657 --> 26:13.615
to believe.I can explain the
science if you want.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.617
No, no, no, we'll
pass. Thank you.
What?

26:15.661 --> 26:17.576
Never say yes
to that, Bozer.To what?

26:20.361 --> 26:23.669
How you doing,
sir? Thank you.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.540
Appreciate your
patience.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.498
Thanks, we'll be
out of your hair

26:27.542 --> 26:28.761
in just a minute,
sir, thank you.

26:28.804 --> 26:30.153
You know, Mac,
I got nothing

26:30.197 --> 26:32.329
but blind faith
in you here, but, uh...

26:32.373 --> 26:34.810
You sure you're right about
the science on this one?

26:38.727 --> 26:39.946
This is it.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.427
Uh, where have you been today?

26:48.563 --> 26:50.521
Okay. This is it.

26:50.565 --> 26:53.002
The cabbie dropped blond Luca
off at this address.

26:53.046 --> 26:55.439
Okay, hang on now.
Matty, uh, just found footage

26:55.483 --> 26:57.528
of a post-makeover Luca
exiting the airport;

26:57.572 --> 26:59.618
he's no movie star, but that's
what he looks like now.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.489
BOZER: Okay, so now we know
what he looks like.

27:01.532 --> 27:02.925
But why come here?Well,

27:02.969 --> 27:04.579
that's what we're gonna
find out. Come on.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.713
Hang on, Mac, now
shouldn't we be wearing

27:07.756 --> 27:10.237
those air filter,
breathing thingies

27:10.280 --> 27:11.542
before we go
marching in there?

27:11.586 --> 27:12.674
Luca won't be contagious

27:12.718 --> 27:14.328
for a few more hours;
we should be good.

27:14.371 --> 27:16.373
That's comforting.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.688
:
I mean, come on.Nice, Bozer.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.776
Nobody's home.
Let's go, fellas.

27:29.735 --> 27:32.999
Mac, don't.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.524
Okay, hang on, hang on.

27:36.567 --> 27:37.830
If you're just gonna go
breaking into the place,

27:37.873 --> 27:40.659
let me at least clear it
first.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.287
Lock's glued shut.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.593
No picking it; you're up.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.467
It's Luca.Thank you!

28:07.729 --> 28:10.689
Please, we need to call police.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.604
What is-- put the gun down,
this isn't Luca.

28:13.648 --> 28:14.910
This is someone else.

28:14.954 --> 28:16.346
Sir, we are with
the American government.

28:16.390 --> 28:17.739
Who are you?

28:17.783 --> 28:20.568
A man showed up at my
door, looked just like me.

28:20.611 --> 28:22.613
But before I could even
process this, he attacked me.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.485
His name's Dr. Luca,
and he changed his appearance

28:24.528 --> 28:25.747
to look just like you.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.749
Why?That's a good question.

28:27.793 --> 28:30.012
Tell us everything you heard
Luca say when he was here.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.666
Even the smallest detail
may be of help.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.668
This guy didn't waste
any time talking.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.757
He jumped me the moment
I opened the door.

28:37.803 --> 28:41.589
What about this? Was
this broken before?

28:44.461 --> 28:45.636
He robbed me.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.290
My camera equipment.

28:47.334 --> 28:48.596
My press pass for tonight,
everything.

28:48.639 --> 28:50.119
Tonight

28:50.163 --> 28:53.775
Dorin Ionescu is being awarded
at his house tonight.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.690
I was asked to take his
photos in the green room

28:55.734 --> 28:57.300
before the award
presentation.

28:57.344 --> 28:58.780
Uh, hang on, hang on, now.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.608
So-so Luca went
through all that trouble

29:00.651 --> 29:02.741
to look exactly
like this guy.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.655
For what?
To attend some random party?

29:04.699 --> 29:06.701
That don't make any sense.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.747
BOZER:
Maybe it's not a random party.

29:08.790 --> 29:11.010
Remember when
I told you Luca's brother

29:11.053 --> 29:12.315
was killed
in a mining accident?

29:12.359 --> 29:14.535
Yeah.
Guess who owns
the mining company.

29:14.578 --> 29:17.320
And was accused of covering up
unsafe work conditions.

29:17.364 --> 29:18.757
Dorin Ionescu.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.541
He must blame him for
his brother's death.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.282
So Luca changes his appearance

29:22.325 --> 29:24.850
to look exactly like
the photographer Sala

29:24.893 --> 29:27.461
so he can attend this party,
get close enough to Ionescu

29:27.504 --> 29:28.810
and infect him with the virus!

29:28.854 --> 29:30.856
You're right;
this is an assassination.

29:36.209 --> 29:38.951
♪

29:41.562 --> 29:44.391
RILEY: Okay, there's still time,
but we got to move fast.

29:44.434 --> 29:47.611
Yeah, before Crumbs McGee
gets powdered sugar everywhere.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.135
You know how hard
that is to clean?

29:49.178 --> 29:51.006
I meant before
he takes the car apart.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.356
That, too.
Yeah.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.662
All right,
we need to get him

29:54.705 --> 29:56.098
out of the garage
and away from the car.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.404
Question is, how?

30:00.233 --> 30:03.236
No, no, no, no, no.
He's got an impact wrench going.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.672
I-I can't watch this.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.761
That gives me an idea.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.910
All right.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.002
Check the car, make sure
everything's in one piece.

30:35.355 --> 30:36.399
What are you doing?

30:36.443 --> 30:37.531
I'm buying us some time.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.880
Using a trick Mac taught me.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.302
Mac, the quickest
the Romanians can get Hazmat

31:09.345 --> 31:10.825
to you is 30 minutes.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.827
When does Luca become
contagious?

31:12.871 --> 31:14.655
MacGYVER:
There's too many variables
to know for sure,

31:14.698 --> 31:16.657
but I'm guessing we have less
than 30 minutes, given the fact

31:16.700 --> 31:17.876
that there's over 100 people
at this party.

31:17.919 --> 31:19.138
That's not good news.

31:21.531 --> 31:25.927
Well, so much
for warning Ionescu's security.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.581
Then it's up to
us to stop Luca.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.452
We just have to
get into the party.

31:29.496 --> 31:30.889
Yeah, but how?
We might look like waitstaff,

31:30.932 --> 31:32.064
but we don't have
the credentials

31:32.107 --> 31:33.326
to get past security.

31:34.631 --> 31:36.198
The guards are more focused
on the front

31:36.242 --> 31:37.721
where the guests
are being checked in,

31:37.765 --> 31:39.375
but I bet security's
a lot lighter in the back.

31:39.419 --> 31:42.291
Does this mean you have a plan
for

31:42.335 --> 31:44.990
Yeah, well, I got to dig in
the neighbor's trash first,

31:45.033 --> 31:46.905
but I think
I got a plan.

31:50.996 --> 31:53.172
Okay, I don't, I don't see
any guards inside,

31:53.215 --> 31:55.652
but the doors are locked.
You're up.

31:55.696 --> 31:57.002
Yeah, well,
definitely don't want

31:57.045 --> 31:58.917
to break the glass
and alert them.

31:58.960 --> 32:00.527
Hold these.
This is exactly why

32:00.570 --> 32:02.050
we dug through
the neighbor's trash.

32:02.094 --> 32:03.051
Put that in there.

32:03.095 --> 32:06.141
This stuff is sticky.

32:06.185 --> 32:08.665
It stinks.MacGYVER: If you've ever locked your keys

32:08.709 --> 32:10.580
in your car,
and you had to call for help,

32:10.624 --> 32:11.930
chances are
your locksmith used a device

32:11.973 --> 32:13.627
called an "air wedge."

32:13.670 --> 32:16.108
In a pinch, you can even make one yourself.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.937
All you need is a sturdy bag,

32:18.980 --> 32:21.330
a pump and proper placement.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.593
Hey, do you think
we'll ever enter a house

32:23.637 --> 32:25.421
like a

32:25.465 --> 32:27.249
I doubt it.

32:27.293 --> 32:30.513
MacGYVER: Then, you just
inflate the bag until...

32:35.562 --> 32:37.825
Sedative.

32:37.868 --> 32:40.001
Where did you...?Don't worry about it.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.742
First one to Luca
injects him.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.918
All we have to do is subdue him
until Hazmat gets here.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.311
Then they can
quarantine him. Oh.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.008
And, uh, uh, don't let him cough
or sneeze on you,

32:47.052 --> 32:49.358
because his fluids carry
the virus. Oh, and, uh,

32:49.402 --> 32:51.970
don't touch him, or especially,
don't let him touch you,

32:52.013 --> 32:53.449
because hands are
the biggest conveyors of germs.

32:53.493 --> 32:55.060
Whoa, wait. So
avoid touching him

32:55.103 --> 32:56.800
while we try to inject him?

32:56.844 --> 32:58.541
Guys, I never said
it was gonna be easy.

33:00.195 --> 33:02.197
♪

33:08.073 --> 33:10.075
BOZER :
Anyone see the good doctor?

33:12.077 --> 33:14.079
JACK:
Not in this room.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.258
I'm gonna check down here.

33:28.832 --> 33:30.008
Hey.

33:31.792 --> 33:34.055
Where the hell are you going

33:34.099 --> 33:36.057
I was just looking for
the kitchen to refill my tray.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.058
Kitchen's the other way.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.756
:
Whoops, my bad.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.106
I'll be on my way.

33:41.149 --> 33:42.411
I don't recognize you.

33:42.455 --> 33:43.804
I checked in all the waitstaff.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.545
I was called in late.
Someone got sick.

33:45.588 --> 33:47.155
You're lying.

33:47.199 --> 33:49.070
I don't know who you are,
but you're coming with me.

33:52.856 --> 33:55.729
Guys, little problem.
Had to use my sedative.

33:55.772 --> 33:57.122
So it's all on you two.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.298
JACK: Copy that, Bozer.
Don't worry, we got this.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.693
MacGYVER:
Guys, I got a visual on Luca.

34:03.737 --> 34:04.999
Headed into the green room.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.349
Yeah, that's got to be
where Ionescu is.

34:07.393 --> 34:08.785
I got to get in there,
but there's four guards

34:08.829 --> 34:10.396
in between me and him.

34:10.439 --> 34:12.311
Sounds like you need
a distraction.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.835
Lucky for us, there's
a Jack Dalton on the team.

34:14.878 --> 34:17.011
Excuse me. Hi, ladies.
How you doing?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.056
Hold that for
me, will you?

34:32.635 --> 34:33.941
Excuse me.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.815
Guys, we got a problem.

34:42.558 --> 34:43.733
Pretty sure
Luca's now contagious.

34:48.695 --> 34:51.045
Jack, Hazmat is just
ten minutes out.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.568
Tell me you have Luca contained.

34:53.656 --> 34:54.831
BOZER:
Matty,

34:54.875 --> 34:56.224
Jack's a little busy right now.

34:58.705 --> 35:01.099
As for Luca, pretty sure
he's not contained yet,

35:01.142 --> 35:03.231
but Mac's working
on that right now.

35:03.275 --> 35:05.190
I hope.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.673
This way, if you don't mind.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.198
The light is better.

35:13.241 --> 35:14.851
Don't let him touch you.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.505
He's infected
and he's trying to kill you.

35:16.549 --> 35:18.116
You three need
to get out of the room now.

35:18.159 --> 35:19.552
I know you're sick.

35:19.595 --> 35:21.902
I need you to stay calm
and still.

35:21.945 --> 35:23.469
No. No, no, no, no.

35:23.512 --> 35:25.601
It can't end this way.

35:25.645 --> 35:27.995
He needs to pay for what
he did to my brother.

35:28.038 --> 35:29.910
To all those people.
He's a monster.

35:29.953 --> 35:32.608
He doesn't deserve to live
when so many have died.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.001
Now get him out of here.

35:34.044 --> 35:36.438
I know about the accident
that killed your brother.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.571
You don't know a damn thing!

35:39.702 --> 35:42.575
There wasn't an accident.

35:42.618 --> 35:45.708
Ionescu rigged the mine
to collapse

35:45.752 --> 35:48.189
so he could
collect insurance.

35:48.233 --> 35:51.410
A dozen miners died
so he could turn a profit.

35:51.453 --> 35:53.803
And your idea of justice
is

35:53.847 --> 35:56.632
Start an epidemic and kill
millions of innocent people?

35:56.676 --> 36:00.462
It was just supposed to be him.

36:00.506 --> 36:02.986
But you...

36:03.030 --> 36:04.684
You ruined that!

36:16.609 --> 36:18.176
What's going on?

36:18.219 --> 36:20.743
Jack, hold this door.
Boze, get that second tarp.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.404
Is this gonna keep
the virus in there?

36:29.448 --> 36:30.884
Not forever, but it should
hold long enough

36:30.927 --> 36:32.407
until Hazmat arrives.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.460
BOZER:
Turns out, Luca was right.

36:41.503 --> 36:44.027
Romanian police dug into the
allegations against Ionescu

36:44.071 --> 36:45.768
and found all kinds of
incriminating evidence

36:45.812 --> 36:46.856
on his computer.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.554
He's going to prison
for a long time.

36:48.597 --> 36:49.729
JACK:
Yeah, he's going to prison,

36:49.772 --> 36:51.470
but Luca's gonna die.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.733
And that's about the only thing
worse than being locked up.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.691
No, I don't think
this is the ending

36:55.735 --> 36:58.216
the good doctor was
looking for. You?

36:58.259 --> 37:01.349
The man infects himself with
a deadly virus with no cure,

37:01.393 --> 37:03.351
almost kills millions of people

37:03.395 --> 37:06.746
only to exact revenge
on one man.

37:06.789 --> 37:09.575
I'm having a hard time wrapping
my head around that.Me, too.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.316
Here's something y'all can
wrap your heads around...

37:12.360 --> 37:14.101
...let's go home.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.711
I'd love to, but...

37:15.755 --> 37:18.453
not sure how long it'll be
before we're allowed to.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.238
Really?

37:21.456 --> 37:23.806
We still may have a deadly virus
inside of us.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.116
Which ambulance
do we go in?

37:29.159 --> 37:30.857
The one Mac and I aren't in.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.902
Ha ha, everybody's got jokes.
I get it.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.821
BOZER:
Jack, you're being ridiculous.

37:38.865 --> 37:40.301
The Romanian hazmat team
examined you

37:40.345 --> 37:41.868
and gave you a clean bill
of health.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.783
Besides, if you were infected,
you'd know it by now

37:43.826 --> 37:45.654
'cause you'd be dead.

37:45.698 --> 37:47.656
I'm telling you,
something's off. Okay?

37:47.700 --> 37:50.790
Woozy, greasy.

37:50.833 --> 37:53.662
Bozer, you want
to feel my glands?

37:53.706 --> 37:55.273
That's gonna be a hard pass.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.231
Take that.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.235
I'm nauseous.
How long is that gonna take?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.324
Just a couple minutes.

38:03.368 --> 38:05.892
No, Matty, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

38:05.935 --> 38:07.110
Don't come in here, seriously.

38:07.154 --> 38:09.461
Mac, why are you humoring him?

38:09.504 --> 38:12.290
Matty, it's a lot easier
than arguing.

38:12.333 --> 38:15.858
I heard that my cleaning
didn't go over so well.

38:15.902 --> 38:18.687
So here is a peace offering
disguised as a sandwich.

38:18.731 --> 38:21.255
And don't worry,

38:21.299 --> 38:22.561
I messed up Mac's
fridge all over again.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.737
Dripped ketchup,
spilled milk,

38:24.780 --> 38:26.695
the whole nine yards,
just for you.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.001
You did?Yes.

38:28.044 --> 38:30.133
It once again looks like
raccoons live in there.

38:30.177 --> 38:32.701
Well, thanks a lot, Leanna.
I really appreciate this.

38:32.745 --> 38:34.094
Oh, no.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.269
Oh, no, what?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.749
It turned blue.

38:36.792 --> 38:37.793
Is blue bad?

38:37.837 --> 38:38.968
It's not good, Jack.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.797
Thanks, Doctor. I knew it.

38:41.841 --> 38:44.147
Now what am I supposed to do?

38:44.191 --> 38:46.280
Hey, just stay calm.Stay calm.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.195
Go to the interrogation room
now,

38:48.238 --> 38:49.762
close the door, lock it.
Wait for my call.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.459
I'm gonna call Dr. Falama.

38:51.503 --> 38:54.244
Oh, and Jack? Cover
your nose and mouth.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.072
And hurry.I knew we shouldn't
have been in that trailer.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.902
Ooh...

39:02.252 --> 39:04.080
What is that?Oh, just some stuff I found

39:04.124 --> 39:05.168
in the supply closet.

39:16.528 --> 39:17.964
Is this the surprise?

39:18.007 --> 39:20.488
Well, you remember when I was
telling you Elwood and I

39:20.532 --> 39:22.403
got to talking about you
when we were together?

39:22.447 --> 39:25.885
Yeah.Well, one of his biggest regrets

39:25.928 --> 39:28.278
was turning his back
on his family.

39:28.322 --> 39:29.715
And not just you.

39:31.456 --> 39:34.372
Come on.

39:37.026 --> 39:40.595
Really, what's going on?

39:40.639 --> 39:44.904
Well, when you were born, Elwood
and his mom weren't talking.

39:44.947 --> 39:48.603
He didn't want to try to fix it
until he got his act together.

39:50.475 --> 39:52.259
Whose house is this?

39:52.302 --> 39:55.088
You'll see.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.744
Hello.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.834
Ms. Dolores, I'm Billy Colton.
We talked on the phone.

40:01.877 --> 40:04.271
Yes, of course. Is this...?

40:04.314 --> 40:06.055
BILLY:
Yes, ma'am.

40:06.099 --> 40:09.058
Dolores, I want to introduce you
to someone very special.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.756
This is
your granddaughter, Riley.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.367
Riley,
meet your grandma.

40:20.983 --> 40:23.899
I've-I've always wanted to...

40:27.903 --> 40:30.471
DOLORES :
It's okay.
