WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.950
Previously on Queen Sugar.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.207
I sold the mill
for 1% equity
in Landry Enterprises.

00:05.250 --> 00:07.377
Everything those people
put you through, put us through?

00:07.420 --> 00:08.626
It's what Daddy
would have wanted.

00:08.670 --> 00:11.252
-They killed him.
-And I'm gonna make them pay!

00:11.300 --> 00:13.086
So why are you here?

00:13.130 --> 00:14.711
Do you miss being around
your people that much?

00:14.760 --> 00:16.387
I've never really been
around my people.

00:16.430 --> 00:18.216
All of the articles
we discussed,

00:18.260 --> 00:20.387
they're no longer available
for your book.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.261
You could write about the black
farmers and their struggles.

00:22.310 --> 00:26.053
If you wouldn't mind,
I splurged on this.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.179
No more Remy.

00:27.230 --> 00:28.857
No more, darling.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.531
-Mommy!
-Yes, yes?

00:44.580 --> 00:47.538
-Look what I made you!
'[gasps] Oh, my gosh!

00:47.590 --> 00:50.957
-It's a coloring book.
-This is amazing.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.716
-You made this for me?
-Yes.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.751
That's Pickles, the gerbil
from our classroom.

00:54.800 --> 00:58.634
-So cute!
-That's him when he's swimming.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.387
And there's Papa
working on the farm.

01:01.430 --> 01:04.137
Oh, we're making
a bonfire on Friday.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.726
A bonfire? Why?

01:05.770 --> 01:08.352
Blue set up
a commemoration,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.607
celebrating Daddy's life.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.686
So we write messages
to Papa,

01:12.740 --> 01:15.732
we put them in the fire
and then send them to heaven.

01:15.780 --> 01:18.271
-Oh!
-Are you coming?

01:22.870 --> 01:24.952
I can't make it
this time.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.991
But...

01:27.040 --> 01:29.281
I made sure to get here
for your birthday party.

01:35.670 --> 01:38.298
Can you go grab some crayons
so we can color it?

01:38.340 --> 01:40.296
-Sure.
-Thank you, thank you.
Love you much.

01:51.730 --> 01:53.357
You cut your hair.

01:54.490 --> 01:55.946
I needed a change.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.605
Fits you.

01:59.070 --> 02:00.526
Thanks.

02:02.080 --> 02:06.119
So, how long
you here for?

02:07.750 --> 02:09.661
I'm here to stay.

02:20.050 --> 02:21.756
So what's happening
with the party?

02:23.930 --> 02:26.262
I don't know.
Are we supposed to do this?

02:26.310 --> 02:30.053
I could start by
picking him up in the morning.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.806
No, I'm talking about...

02:33.520 --> 02:35.317
I don't know how
it's supposed to work.

02:36.780 --> 02:39.908
As long as Blue's
in St. Jo,

02:39.950 --> 02:42.236
I'm staying in St. Jo.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.708
I'm going to be
in my son's life.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.701
And I'll do whatever
I have to to make it work.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.420
Dreams never die

03:03.470 --> 03:05.552
Take flight
As the world turns

03:05.600 --> 03:07.340
Dreams never die

03:07.390 --> 03:09.597
Take flight
As the world turns

03:09.640 --> 03:11.221
Keep the colors
In the lines

03:11.270 --> 03:13.511
Take flight

03:13.560 --> 03:14.891
Dreams never die

03:20.990 --> 03:23.902
Keep the colors
In the lines

03:23.950 --> 03:28.034
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

03:30.710 --> 03:32.996
-Hey, Aunt Violet.
-Hey, Charley.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.281
So, um... Hold on.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.456
Uh, I made
an appointment

03:37.500 --> 03:40.469
for Prosper to see the doctor
tomorrow morning.

03:40.510 --> 03:44.674
But now I am up to my eyeballs
in cherry pies,

03:44.720 --> 03:47.382
and I know if one of us don't
take that man,

03:47.430 --> 03:49.341
he ain't going,
so I need you to step in.

03:49.390 --> 03:51.472
I would, uh, but tomorrow

03:51.520 --> 03:53.226
I've got
a maintenance guy coming

03:53.270 --> 03:55.306
-to upgrade the turbine, so...
-Charley?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.681
Can't somebody else
over there at that mill

03:57.730 --> 03:59.140
meet with
the maintenance guy?

03:59.190 --> 04:01.238
Well, why can't Nova do it?

04:01.280 --> 04:03.692
Because Nova is shopping
and preparing

04:03.740 --> 04:05.526
for your daddy's
commemoration.

04:05.570 --> 04:08.152
If you two were talking,

04:08.200 --> 04:10.782
and you came down off your
high horse, you'd know that.

04:10.830 --> 04:12.400
So, back to Prosper.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.667
I need you to
pick him up by 10:00,

04:14.710 --> 04:17.247
'cause he has to be at
Westside Memorial by 10:30.

04:17.290 --> 04:18.871
All right?

04:18.920 --> 04:21.548
Thank you,
and I love you, baby.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.795
[beeps]

04:36.730 --> 04:39.938
This bitter bird

04:43.860 --> 04:48.115
What fruit it bears

04:50.580 --> 04:55.859
What good is love

04:57.580 --> 05:02.540
That no one shares?

05:07.090 --> 05:09.172
[continues, indistinct]

05:16.730 --> 05:19.472
The glow of a rose

05:20.770 --> 05:24.888
What good am I?

05:26.780 --> 05:31.570
I'm only close

05:33.410 --> 05:39.326
This bitter bird

05:41.050 --> 05:45.293
It feels so good

05:53.390 --> 05:55.176
We are out of pie boxes.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.879
No, there's more
in my trunk.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.896
My keys are over there
next to my purse.

05:58.940 --> 06:00.760
-Okay.
-[phone buzzes]

06:00.810 --> 06:02.721
-Hey, Nova.
-Hey.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.566
What are you doing,

06:04.610 --> 06:05.816
besides staring at that
beautiful ring on your finger?

06:05.860 --> 06:07.691
[chuckles]

06:07.740 --> 06:10.117
I'm getting a batch
of cherry pies out the door.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.617
How's it going? You got
everything for Friday?

06:12.660 --> 06:16.073
Yep. I was just seeing
what you were up to.

06:16.120 --> 06:20.124
-What you need, baby?
-I could use some
Aunt Vi wisdom.

06:20.170 --> 06:23.298
I don't know what this book
is supposed to be about.

06:23.340 --> 06:26.298
Now, they gave you
this book deal 'cause
they want to know about you.

06:26.340 --> 06:28.171
What's there
to figure out?

06:28.220 --> 06:30.211
I know. It...

06:30.260 --> 06:32.467
It's just a case
of writers' block.

06:32.510 --> 06:35.843
Girl, I ain't got no time
for writers' block.

06:35.890 --> 06:39.189
Too much to say
and not enough time to say it.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.186
Here's what I know:

06:41.230 --> 06:43.642
You're the only writer
I know from St. Jo.

06:43.690 --> 06:45.817
That means something.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.522
Shoot, you got stories
up and down this land.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.561
-Uh, got to go.
-[phone beeps]

06:50.610 --> 06:52.692
Hey, Miss Effie.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.197
I know it's a mess, but it'll
all be clean in about an hour.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.992
It's not about the mess.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.668
Your time's up.

06:59.710 --> 07:01.996
The Wednesday Supper Club is
out there pouting like puppies.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.749
I have the kitchen from 8:00
to 5:00 on Wednesdays.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.792
It's on the calendar. I've got
another two batches to go.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.889
Well, there must be some sort
of misunderstanding,

07:11.930 --> 07:14.501
because they've been
doing their supper club

07:14.560 --> 07:16.676
for as long
as I've been here.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.518
Good, churchgoing
people.

07:22.730 --> 07:25.563
Miss Effie,
we have an agreement.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.475
It seems that the checks

07:27.530 --> 07:29.486
I've been writing the church
are clearing just fine.

07:29.530 --> 07:31.771
I'm sure the good Lord
appreciates that,

07:31.820 --> 07:35.654
but they'll still be coming in
on Wednesdays at 4:00 pm.

07:35.700 --> 07:39.192
So, whatever you need to do
to finish up...

07:44.080 --> 07:45.957
"Good Lord," my ass.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.508
Right, so with Sam at 41%

07:50.550 --> 07:53.292
and his sister Frances
at 35,

07:53.340 --> 07:57.049
you'd better believe
that 6% divide put a rift
between those two.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.888
There's a history of tension
on both sides of that family.

08:00.930 --> 08:02.932
That pool of investors
at 80/0"

08:02.980 --> 08:05.517
one of them makes more money
than he reports,

08:05.560 --> 08:07.437
and, surprise, surprise,
another one

08:07.480 --> 08:10.483
has a propensity
for prostitutes.

08:10.530 --> 08:12.191
Of course they do.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.368
Oh, and, um, Frances' sons,
Jacob and Paul,

08:15.410 --> 08:17.025
they're splitting
their 50/0.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.287
I mean, you know that
already.

08:19.330 --> 08:22.367
I don't know.
Those Boudreaux boys,
they keep it clean.

08:22.410 --> 08:24.162
Well, when it comes
to Jacob,

08:24.210 --> 08:26.166
there's no way he has
a spotless record.

08:26.210 --> 08:28.087
I'll keep digging
on my end.

08:28.130 --> 08:30.121
What else you got
on Sam's son?

08:30.170 --> 08:32.923
Ooh. Colton Landry,

08:32.970 --> 08:36.383
Sam's only son, with 10%.

08:36.430 --> 08:39.718
He's this hotshot
patent lawyer In Houston.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.763
Iw League. Wife and kids.
Goes to church every Sunday.

08:43.810 --> 08:46.472
Oh, and he also has
a really nice

08:46.520 --> 08:49.853
piece on the side
for the last five years.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.982
-What a piece of work.
-Mm.

08:52.030 --> 08:55.102
But everything else
seems to be pretty legit.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.310
No, there's got
to be more.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.907
This family's dirty.
I've seen it.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.624
Four stories in,
and he's finally asleep.

09:11.510 --> 09:15.253
He was, uh, telling me
about his field trip,

09:16.590 --> 09:18.251
asked if
I could chaperone.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.467
I already told his teacher
I'd take him.

09:29.480 --> 09:31.778
He's got plastic
under his sheets.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.776
He started
wetting the bed

09:39.120 --> 09:40.485
a few weeks
after you left.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.536
Why didn't you tell me?

09:48.580 --> 09:50.241
He didn't want
nobody to know.

09:52.130 --> 09:55.668
-He embarrassed by it.
-That's something I should know.

09:57.590 --> 09:58.921
Yeah.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.342
Blue didn't want
to celebrate his birthday

10:06.770 --> 10:10.854
because of what happened to Pops
and his party last year.

10:12.820 --> 10:16.859
But I suggested we do this
bonfire thing for Pop instead.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.198
It's got a spiritual
meaning to it.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.117
Something like that.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.578
Said it'd help
to make his birthday feel

10:28.370 --> 10:29.871
happy again.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.040
I know that
this is been...

10:43.430 --> 10:44.556
hard...

10:46.810 --> 10:48.516
for you and Blue.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.975
I want to
make things right.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.276
I want to
figure this out.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.697
-You could've told me
you was coming.
-I tried.

11:02.740 --> 11:05.368
You wouldn't listen.

11:21.470 --> 11:23.006
We'll figure it out.

11:38.690 --> 11:42.023
They're here somewhere.
I...

11:43.740 --> 11:46.072
I, uh, I...

11:46.120 --> 11:49.499
found my insurance card
with the medical records.

11:49.540 --> 11:52.998
Well, we've got about half
an hour to get on over there.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.497
Claire had this system...

11:57.130 --> 11:59.621
but I never understood it.

12:01.380 --> 12:05.749
I mean, it's got to be
in here somewhere.

12:31.330 --> 12:33.537
Mr. Prosper, you play?

12:36.920 --> 12:38.876
Yeah.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.718
Yeah, your daddy used to find me
down on Frenchman Street

12:41.760 --> 12:44.001
jamming with the fellas.

12:45.260 --> 12:47.000
Yeah.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.382
Yeah, it's been
a while now.

12:52.020 --> 12:53.976
A long while.

12:55.850 --> 12:58.728
I don't mean to rush you,
Mr. Prosper,

12:58.770 --> 13:02.399
but I will face Aunt Vi's wrath
if we don't make it to
this appointment.

13:06.740 --> 13:09.527
Can I have just a second?

13:11.330 --> 13:12.786
Yeah.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.582
Your aunties always
used to talk about

13:19.630 --> 13:22.167
about you were
so headstrong,

13:22.210 --> 13:25.043
and nothing could stand
in your way.

13:25.090 --> 13:29.129
Used to sing your praises
to anybody that would listen.

13:36.810 --> 13:38.300
I miss her.

13:43.940 --> 13:45.737
Me too.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.442
Now all I've got is...

13:50.910 --> 13:53.242
a cane and a bad back.

14:00.670 --> 14:04.254
Maybe we can reschedule
for tomorrow,

14:04.300 --> 14:07.929
and I can
come over early

14:07.970 --> 14:10.256
and help you find
that paperwork.

14:11.760 --> 14:14.092
I'm sorry
to waste your time.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.515
It's all right.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.300
Marvin's in _
the freezer section.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.396
I'll be right behind you.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.146
I'm telling you, Vi, there's got
to be a better way than this.

14:25.190 --> 14:27.943
We're doing fine.
Just don't worry, now.

14:27.990 --> 14:30.447
You need a real
delivery truck.

14:30.490 --> 14:32.651
I can't be spending
that kind of money.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.782
You ain't got to
spend nothing.

14:36.790 --> 14:38.280
[grunts]

14:46.130 --> 14:48.428
Vi, some of these pies
look smushed.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.677
-You want me to
take them all in?
-No. No, no.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.676
I'm coming. Let me see.

15:05.150 --> 15:06.981
[groans]

15:07.030 --> 15:09.772
My belly hurts.

15:09.820 --> 15:12.402
How many slices
did you eat?

15:12.450 --> 15:14.907
[scoffs]
That's why.

15:14.950 --> 15:16.360
Mm-hmm.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.321
I'm going
to the bathroom.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.781
Pop,
I can do it myself.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.756
Wash your hands.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.000
I want to go
on the field trip.

15:34.050 --> 15:36.678
I already told you,
I talked to his teacher.

15:36.720 --> 15:40.804
-Why can't we both go?
-Like I said, I already talked
to Miss Santiago.

15:40.850 --> 15:44.809
I shouldn't have
to ask permi55ion

15:44.860 --> 15:47.021
to spend time
with my son.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.651
Our son.

15:54.530 --> 15:56.521
I'm still his mom.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.953
And you're still
his dad.

16:02.710 --> 16:05.247
-That hasn't changed.
-Everything changed.

16:08.460 --> 16:11.213
Everything changed.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.850
Hey.
What you got there?

16:33.910 --> 16:35.480
Wait, hold on.
Let me help.

16:35.530 --> 16:37.657
-Food for the bonfire.
-All right.

16:37.700 --> 16:39.782
We're supposed to have
some folks come build it.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.570
What are you doing here?

16:41.620 --> 16:43.030
Today the farm
is my classroom.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.741
I got some students
coming out.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.280
I'm gonna teach 'em all
about fertilization.

16:46.330 --> 16:47.831
Fascinating.

16:47.880 --> 16:48.995
I'm sure
that'll keep 'em awake.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.291
Oh-ho! You got jokes!

16:51.340 --> 16:54.298
Oh, wait a minute. I'm as
fascinating as Professor X.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.921
Okay? My students
love me.

16:55.970 --> 16:58.256
-You keep telling yourself that.
-Wow!

16:58.300 --> 17:01.178
I know you're a great teacher.
Ra even told me so.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.472
Oh.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.853
Wasn't that long ago,
your brother was sitting
in my class.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.722
Now look at him. Almost looks
like your daddy out there.

17:14.490 --> 17:16.481
All right, lady.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.442
I'm gonna head over there.
I'll see you tonight.

17:29.130 --> 17:31.041
[doorbell rings]

17:31.090 --> 17:33.968
-Micah, your dad's here.
-Okay.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.057
-[door opens, closes]
-[Davis] What's up?

17:41.100 --> 17:44.479
-So what's the plan?
-It's a surprise.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.385
Okay.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.806
Actually, I'm gonna grab
my phone right quick.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.509
-Be right back.
-Okay.

17:53.190 --> 17:54.430
Hey, Charley.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.811
How are you, Davis?

17:58.910 --> 18:00.775
The work never stops
for you, huh?

18:00.830 --> 18:03.993
No, it does not.

18:05.710 --> 18:07.996
You really added
a nice touch to the place.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.206
Nothing's changed since
the last time you saw it.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.416
Say, what's going on
at Ralph Angel's place?

18:16.470 --> 18:18.506
Micah said you guys
were doing something over there?

18:18.550 --> 18:20.541
Yeah, Grandpa's
commemoration.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.557
Oh.

18:25.850 --> 18:27.761
Well, you two
better get going.

18:27.810 --> 18:30.472
-Have fun.
-Thanks. Bye.

18:32.110 --> 18:34.021
-Ready to go.
-All right.

18:45.700 --> 18:48.407
What's all this?
What you doing in here?

18:48.460 --> 18:50.667
Just one of Nova's
healthy recipes.

18:50.710 --> 18:53.087
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Now, check it.

18:53.130 --> 18:56.122
Boogie was telling me about
this old delivery truck
in a junkyard.

18:56.170 --> 19:00.334
Says all it needs is
a couple hundred dollars
to fix it on up.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.506
Put a refrigerator unit
in there.

19:02.550 --> 19:05.769
No more smushed pies,
no more lost inventory.

19:05.810 --> 19:08.267
I hear what you're saying,

19:08.310 --> 19:10.301
and I appreciate
all this effort,

19:10.350 --> 19:12.432
but I want to do this
my way,

19:12.480 --> 19:14.766
and I ain't ready to buy
no delivery truck.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.356
No, baby, I'm buying it.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.277
Oh, no, no, no.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.606
I mean for you to keep
your wallet it in your pocket.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.366
Uh-uh. See, I already
got a guy, right?

19:22.410 --> 19:24.366
He going to put
the logo on a magnet.

19:24.410 --> 19:27.152
Slap that sucker
on the side of this thing,

19:27.200 --> 19:28.781
and the whole world
will know

19:28.830 --> 19:31.993
that Vi's Prize Pies
have arrived.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.828
Well, I appreciate it.

19:35.880 --> 19:39.259
But I started
this business myself,

19:39.300 --> 19:42.633
and... that's the way
I want to keep it.

19:42.680 --> 19:45.888
Ain't no shame in letting
loved ones pitch in.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.921
It's all beautiful,
baby.

19:47.970 --> 19:49.267
Really is.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.648
But at this point in my life,
I don't want to owe nobody
nothing.

19:55.860 --> 19:56.929
"Owe"?

19:57.900 --> 19:59.561
[scoffs]

20:04.410 --> 20:06.480
You know Jimmy Dale
bought this house,

20:07.950 --> 20:10.453
and he let me know it
every time

20:10.500 --> 20:12.616
I stepped foot
through that door.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.662
Held money over my head
like he owned me.

20:15.710 --> 20:18.497
Yeah, but me and Jimmy Dale
are like night and day,
so don't go there.

20:18.550 --> 20:22.042
Now, look, all I'm trying
to tell you is that this truck

20:22.090 --> 20:24.217
is going to do
a whole lot of...

20:27.220 --> 20:30.348
Baby, I see you out here.
You're doing some great things.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.302
I also see that you need
to take care of yourself.

20:35.360 --> 20:39.103
Vi, you're gonna have to
slow down somewhere,

20:39.150 --> 20:40.981
or you're going to have to
let somebody help.

20:41.030 --> 20:45.148
I seen Ernest work himself
into the ground.

20:47.410 --> 20:49.901
I just can't have you
do the same thing.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.087
Many people look
at this land and think,

21:04.130 --> 21:06.758
"Long hours
and hard labor."

21:06.800 --> 21:09.883
But actually, farming is
a soul-enriching process

21:09.930 --> 21:12.091
that can be a_viable
career option.

21:12.140 --> 21:16.304
I mean, there are 915 million
acres of farmland in the US.

21:16.350 --> 21:19.012
915.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.528
Now, what percentage of that
is owned by black farmers?

21:22.570 --> 21:24.026
30%?

21:24.070 --> 21:25.901
Try .30/0.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.863
NOt 3°/o, .30/0.

21:29.910 --> 21:32.947
And you're standing on
part of that .3% right here.

21:35.330 --> 21:38.322
Now, this sister here
is Nova Bordelon.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.498
-Hi, guys. [clears throat]
-Her father, Ernest Bordelon,
may he rest in peace,

21:42.550 --> 21:45.758
is one of the finest
farmers I've ever known,
and he owned this farm.

21:45.800 --> 21:48.883
Now, Nova,
her brother, Ralph Angel

21:48.930 --> 21:51.387
and her sister Charley
continue that tradition.

21:52.930 --> 21:54.921
How long has your family
owned the land?

21:54.980 --> 21:56.845
My daddy worked it
from the time he was a kid

21:56.890 --> 21:58.642
till last year,
when he passed.

21:58.690 --> 22:01.648
-You work on it?
-No, my brother over there,

22:01.690 --> 22:04.432
Ralph Angel,
he runs the farm now.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.731
You didn't want to farm?

22:06.780 --> 22:10.443
Farming's my brother's calling.
I got my own thing.

22:10.490 --> 22:12.071
How many of you
want to be farmers?

22:14.750 --> 22:17.207
Well, maybe you are
a good teacher.

22:17.250 --> 22:19.036
[chuckles]

22:23.630 --> 22:25.871
Whoo!
I'm telling you,

22:25.920 --> 22:28.127
you couldn't touch me on this
back when I was your age.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.751
That's probably because it's
the only thing you had to play.

22:30.800 --> 22:33.382
-And you're not even close
to my score. Just give up.
-So what?

22:33.430 --> 22:35.728
-[video game beeping]
-See?

22:35.770 --> 22:37.635
[exasperated groan]

22:37.690 --> 22:40.397
-That's just a warm-up.
-Oh, now it's just a warm-up?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.226
Yeah, now I'm about to
start playing.

22:42.270 --> 22:43.771
[phone buzzing]

22:47.200 --> 22:49.191
Look, I'm about to go grab
some soda. You need anything?

22:49.240 --> 22:51.526
Oh, no, I'm going to stay here
and beat your score.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.820
[alarm chirps]

23:00.420 --> 23:02.490
My jacket's
back in the kitchen.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.337
You know, I can get it.
I can get it.

23:04.380 --> 23:06.200
It's on one
of the chairs.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.579
Okay.

23:07.630 --> 23:09.678
Are you good to--

24:58.410 --> 25:00.901
All right.
I'm heading out.

25:00.950 --> 25:03.783
I just wanted to say goodbye
before going to wash up.

25:03.830 --> 25:05.627
Look at this.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.370
Oh, man.

25:08.420 --> 25:10.547
-Is it Ernest's?
-It was the family's.

25:10.590 --> 25:13.502
We used to go fishing
when I was a kid.

25:13.550 --> 25:15.256
Nova Bordelon,

25:15.300 --> 25:17.632
activist, journalist
and fisher woman?

25:17.680 --> 25:21.264
Ra was just a baby, and Charley
didn't want to get dirty.

25:21.310 --> 25:25.019
So it was me and Daddy.

25:25.060 --> 25:27.858
I remember the last time
we went out,

25:27.900 --> 25:30.391
I was... maybe 10?

25:32.070 --> 25:34.891
We were on our way
to Lake Verette.

25:34.950 --> 25:38.158
We stopped at this Podunk
gas station to grab bait.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.361
He left me in the truck,

25:40.410 --> 25:43.322
and when he comes back, Daddy
walked up with a busted lip.

25:43.370 --> 25:45.702
He didn't have to
say nothing, 'cause I saw

25:45.750 --> 25:48.662
three white men watching
as he left the store.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.252
I still remember the smug look
upon them faces

25:53.300 --> 25:56.929
and how Daddy looked like
he wanted to kill them.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.057
He never said nothing
about it that day.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.556
Just...

26:04.930 --> 26:06.841
Just wanted _me
to feel speCIal,

26:06.890 --> 26:09.017
like nothing
ever happened.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.312
I remember sitting there
so angry.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.488
I, uh,

26:16.530 --> 26:18.566
I stopped fishing
after that.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.161
Sorry about that.

26:28.210 --> 26:29.916
Yeah.

26:32.170 --> 26:33.706
Me too.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.967
So when you go in
for surgery,

26:41.010 --> 26:43.467
do you have someone
to look after you?

26:43.510 --> 26:45.762
Oh, I can
call my daughter.

26:47.770 --> 26:49.306
You haven't
told her yet?

26:49.350 --> 26:52.103
She's, uh, she's busy

26:52.150 --> 26:54.812
with work and the kid,
but I'm going to call her.

27:03.030 --> 27:05.999
Does she know about
your eVIction?

27:09.420 --> 27:11.490
That's nobody's business
but my own.

27:11.540 --> 27:14.839
I'm sorry. I just, I saw it
on your kitchen table.

27:14.880 --> 27:17.087
I've got it under control.

27:17.130 --> 27:19.712
Ithought
you owned the land.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.261
I've been leasing it
for decades,

27:29.310 --> 27:32.052
until they cut
my land lease.

27:32.100 --> 27:35.479
Sam agreed to let us stay in
the house for all those years.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.527
I'd appreciate it
if you kept this to yourself.

27:42.070 --> 27:43.446
-[door opens]
-Yeah.

27:43.490 --> 27:45.117
[man]
Prosper Denton?

27:58.380 --> 28:00.621
They've got your number
back there, Mr. Denton.

28:00.670 --> 28:01.967
You know the drill.

28:03.340 --> 28:05.467
_ I'll kno_ck
in a few minutes.

28:06.930 --> 28:09.137
-Hey.
-You work here.

28:09.180 --> 28:10.977
Yeah,
for a few years now.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.510
Is Mr. Denton
your father?

28:12.560 --> 28:15.358
-No. A family friend.
-Oh.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.686
It's very nice of you
to bring him in.

28:17.730 --> 28:21.689
-Please don't think that H...
-You don't have to. Really.

28:21.740 --> 28:23.446
I didn't want you to think
that I didn't want to call.

28:23.490 --> 28:25.731
Things have just
been a little crazy.

28:25.780 --> 28:27.486
It's okay, really.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.781
I just haven't
had a chance

28:29.830 --> 28:32.742
to think about me,
you know?

28:32.790 --> 28:35.327
Yeah.

28:35.380 --> 28:38.793
Well, if things get less crazy,
and you, um,

28:38.840 --> 28:41.547
have time to think about you,
the offer still stands.

28:41.590 --> 28:45.799
If you ever want to get a slice
of pie or a cup of coffee,

28:45.850 --> 28:47.294
I know a great place.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.807
It's an all-night joint,
so...

28:49.850 --> 28:52.091
But, seriously,
they've got the best pie.

28:52.140 --> 28:55.018
You really have
your food spots down.

28:55.060 --> 28:58.439
I do. I do, so...
so anytime.

28:58.480 --> 29:02.029
I will... consider that.

29:02.070 --> 29:03.947
-Thank you.
-All right.

29:03.990 --> 29:06.402
I should, uh...
I should go then.

29:06.450 --> 29:08.020
-Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
-Okay.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.695
Okay.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.742
-I'll be here.
-All right.

29:14.830 --> 29:16.661
[door shuts]

29:25.260 --> 29:27.046
You got your grandpa's
commemoration?

29:27.090 --> 29:28.466
Yep.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.978
You know,
Ernest meant more to me

29:35.020 --> 29:38.103
than most anybody
realizes.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.186
He came to
all my big games.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.198
And he would just call,

29:47.240 --> 29:51.358
just to shoot the breeze
sometimes,

29:51.410 --> 29:53.742
or offer advice--

29:53.790 --> 29:56.953
you know, just about
life, love...

29:58.790 --> 30:00.280
everything.

30:03.090 --> 30:05.581
And I'd never
experienced that.

30:10.430 --> 30:12.807
Treated me more like a son
than my own father.

30:14.980 --> 30:16.880
Hey, Dad, what's up?

30:19.560 --> 30:21.608
[sighs]

30:24.780 --> 30:26.736
You have a sister,
Micah.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.442
I have a daughter.

30:32.490 --> 30:34.742
What are you
talking about?

30:37.250 --> 30:39.206
Her name's Tia,

30:41.250 --> 30:43.241
and, uh,

30:43.300 --> 30:46.792
her mother is a woman I was
involved With a while ago.

30:49.720 --> 30:53.304
-She passed away
recently, and Tia--
-How old is she?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.767
Thirteen.

30:59.810 --> 31:01.300
Thirteen?

31:03.190 --> 31:04.521
Yep.

31:06.650 --> 31:08.857
Did you know about her
the whole time?

31:13.120 --> 31:14.940
Yep.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.951
Look,

31:19.000 --> 31:22.629
I'm ashamed of
what I did, Micah.

31:22.670 --> 31:24.160
Okay?

31:24.210 --> 31:26.508
But I'm not ashamed
ofhen

31:26.550 --> 31:29.587
And I want you to know
about her.

31:29.630 --> 31:31.461
I want you to meet her.

31:31.510 --> 31:33.796
Does my mom know?

31:37.730 --> 31:39.379
Not yet.

31:44.150 --> 31:46.937
Come on, man.
Micah, come on.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.858
We can at least
talk about it.

31:49.900 --> 31:51.231
Micah.

31:54.620 --> 31:56.281
Come on.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.952
Why are farmers who are leasing
your land being kicked off?

32:06.000 --> 32:10.869
The Johnsons, Gibsons,
Donald Hayes, Prosper Denton.

32:10.920 --> 32:14.003
This is about the EPA, Charley.
This isn't us.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.426
-Have a seat.
-I don't want to sit.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.426
Why would the Environmental
Protection Agency

32:19.480 --> 32:21.380
want to kick people
off of your land?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.806
Those two hurricanes
last year

32:23.850 --> 32:26.227
flushed runoff from
the Watkins Mill that shut down,

32:26.270 --> 32:28.852
all the runoff,
onto our farmland.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.481
Hundreds of acres.

32:30.530 --> 32:33.237
EPA said they found mercury
in the soil.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.363
They're having us move tenants
off the farmland so they can
do more testing.

32:36.410 --> 32:39.038
We're victims here too.
This hurts us financially.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.492
Why wasn't I notified?

32:41.540 --> 32:44.031
Two of those families who are
milling With me just broke
their contracts

32:44.080 --> 32:46.628
but were too prideful to say
what was really going on.

32:46.670 --> 32:48.490
We'll make
that cost up.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.006
It's not about
the cost, Jacob.

32:50.050 --> 32:52.086
It's about the people.
Prosper Denton.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.422
A family friend
is on that list.

32:57.470 --> 33:00.268
He's lived in that house
for decades.

33:00.310 --> 33:02.016
Your family broke
his land lease,

33:02.060 --> 33:04.051
and now the man is just
hanging on by a thread.

33:04.100 --> 33:07.263
And were trying to make good
by compensating the farmers.

33:07.310 --> 33:09.471
I don't know if five grand

33:09.530 --> 33:11.737
is compensation for being
kicked out of your house.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.851
[phone rings]

33:18.410 --> 33:20.116
Excuse me.

33:20.160 --> 33:21.866
Hey, Nancy.

33:21.910 --> 33:23.901
Yeah, I know.
She's here.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.700
-Thanks.
-[phone beeps]

33:28.040 --> 33:29.541
Have a seat, please.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.797
I want to help
take care of this.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.219
Charley, please, sit.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.756
You're part of this
too now.

34:01.290 --> 34:05.329
Me and Papa would write messages
to Grandma in heaven.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.456
What was she like?

34:09.500 --> 34:11.411
_Made the best
Cinnamon waffles.

34:11.460 --> 34:13.257
[chuckles]

34:13.300 --> 34:15.370
She would play with me
and my stuffed animals for hours

34:15.420 --> 34:17.217
in this very room.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.797
Which used to be my room.

34:24.180 --> 34:26.057
How did she die?

34:28.020 --> 34:29.760
She got sick.

34:30.730 --> 34:31.856
Like Mommy?

34:32.940 --> 34:34.066
Different kind of sick.

34:36.450 --> 34:37.815
Do you miss her?

34:38.700 --> 34:39.860
Every day.

34:42.370 --> 34:45.248
Yeah, I miss them both.

34:54.210 --> 34:56.258
This one's gonna be mine.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.251
I'm telling Papa thanks.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.790
For what?

35:02.260 --> 35:03.966
For bringing Mommy home.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.801
I missed her
every day too.

35:16.900 --> 35:18.310
Yeah.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.026
We'd always
spend Christmas Eve

35:23.080 --> 35:24.820
at the bonfire
at the levy.

35:24.870 --> 35:28.362
The whole town would come out
to celebrate.

35:28.410 --> 35:30.071
They told us kids that

35:30.120 --> 35:32.122
the fire would
light the way

35:32.170 --> 35:34.377
for Santa Claus
to come find us

35:34.420 --> 35:36.706
and bring us presents,

35:36.760 --> 35:39.376
but Mama said

35:39.420 --> 35:43.538
the fire was how we talk
to our ancestors.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.000
Create a pathway,

35:46.060 --> 35:49.132
send them messages
in the flames.

35:49.180 --> 35:52.559
And when our own
granddaddy died,

35:55.980 --> 35:59.188
Ernest hugged me and said

35:59.240 --> 36:01.947
that a bonfire would light
his way to heaven.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.828
He always knew how
to make you feel better.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.997
Blue, baby, come here.

36:16.090 --> 36:19.912
So it became a tradition
that we passed on to this
beautiful young man.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.177
Him and Ernest
would come out here

36:22.220 --> 36:25.792
every winter
and build a fire.

36:25.850 --> 36:29.468
Send messages to heaven.

36:29.520 --> 36:33.263
With all those beautiful
embers rismg up.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.930
You want to take it
from here, Blue?

36:39.480 --> 36:41.732
This is how I'm celebrating
my birthday.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.231
By celebrating my papa.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.571
We miss you, Daddy.

36:58.090 --> 37:01.048
We miss you.

37:01.090 --> 37:03.217
All right, everyone.

37:03.260 --> 37:06.218
Go put your messages
in now.

37:06.260 --> 37:08.000
They'll go up to Papa.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.090
Put your message in now.

37:20.650 --> 37:23.392
[thinking] Grandpa,
I wish we had more time.

37:27.570 --> 37:30.573
[Davis]
Family means everything to me.

37:30.620 --> 37:33.578
Every night I come home
to this beautiful woman,

37:33.620 --> 37:35.861
this incredible young man.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.083
I'm just thankful each day that
God brought them into my life.

37:39.130 --> 37:40.745
You know?
I'm grateful, man.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.791
-Family's everything.
-[knock at door]

37:42.840 --> 37:44.580
I just wanted to say
good night.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.837
Good night, Mom.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.755
Don't stay up
too late.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.258
All this stress
Ain't helping at all

37:56.310 --> 37:58.801
Best way I know how

38:01.020 --> 38:04.569
[thinking] Daddy,
our story will live on.

38:04.610 --> 38:07.773
Just stick to the rivers
And the lakes

38:07.820 --> 38:10.152
That you're used to

38:10.200 --> 38:14.739
I know that you're gonna
Have it your way

38:14.790 --> 38:17.497
Or nothing at all

38:17.540 --> 38:20.873
Your way

38:26.380 --> 38:29.292
[thinking] Thank you
for always taking care of me.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.846
What's on your mind?

38:34.890 --> 38:38.599
I'm gonna take you up
on that delivery truck.

38:38.650 --> 38:41.357
But it ain't easy
for me, baby.

38:44.820 --> 38:47.698
I guess you're gonna
have to let me figure

38:47.740 --> 38:51.198
some of this out
as we go along.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.322
Are you okay
with that?

39:03.130 --> 39:05.121
[thinking]
Mom and Pop,

39:05.170 --> 39:07.161
_I'|| raise him
in your name.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.792
We will all find peace

39:10.840 --> 39:13.809
In our final
Resting place

39:39.710 --> 39:44.738
Don't go chasing
Waterfalls

39:44.800 --> 39:47.542
Just stick to the rivers
And the lakes

39:47.590 --> 39:50.548
That you're used to

39:50.590 --> 39:54.549
I know that you're gonna
Have it your way

39:54.600 --> 39:57.717
Or nothing at all

39:57.770 --> 39:59.556
[thinking]
Dear Daddy,

39:59.600 --> 40:01.386
I'll take care of him.

40:16.700 --> 40:20.284
Don't go

40:29.210 --> 40:33.920
Don't go chasing
Waterfalls

40:33.970 --> 40:37.212
Just stick to the rivers
And the lakes

40:37.260 --> 40:39.979
That you're used to

40:41.980 --> 40:46.758
Don't go

40:53.280 --> 40:55.111
Oh, oui, oui.
