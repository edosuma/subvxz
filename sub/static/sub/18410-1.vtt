Hey!

05:12.261 --> 05:15.097
Yes. Yes, hello.

05:15.098 --> 05:18.032
I'm having a medical situation.

05:19.835 --> 05:22.204
Yeah, okay, um...

05:22.205 --> 05:25.774
I don't have a belly button.

05:25.775 --> 05:29.145
I do not have a belly button

05:29.146 --> 05:31.280
where I should on my belly,

05:31.281 --> 05:35.918
and I'm concerned because
I don't know if that's...

05:35.919 --> 05:39.721
Can a person live
without a belly button?

05:39.722 --> 05:42.723
'Cause if you think about it,
you're born with one...

05:44.126 --> 05:47.029
and if you don't have one
you're unborn,

05:47.030 --> 05:51.167
and it's really hazy
whether you're alive or not.

05:51.168 --> 05:54.435
I guess I'm wondering...

05:55.537 --> 05:57.972
am I alive?

05:59.942 --> 06:02.577
Or what if I'm God?

06:03.545 --> 06:05.781
I don't think I need an ambulance,

06:05.782 --> 06:08.184
but I should probably
go to the hospital.

06:08.185 --> 06:11.419
Yeah, I should.

07:03.973 --> 07:06.275
Like you've never done worse!

07:06.276 --> 07:08.527
Okay, yes, he totaled a car,

07:08.528 --> 07:10.762
but it was an environmentally
friendly car.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.365
Why doesn't that get reported?

07:12.366 --> 07:16.302
He was heartbroken, betrayed.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.405
You say you understand,
but you don't... you can't.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.141
You're like a big, giant Vulcan.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.842
He's coming.
I'll call you later.

07:23.843 --> 07:28.514
Hi. Margaret.
I work for Lola.

07:28.515 --> 07:31.050
- Gary.
- I know.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.585
We need to go out the back.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.823
Are there reporters out front?

07:37.824 --> 07:39.458
A few.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.927
Not Hugh Grant level,
more like Robert Downey Jr.

07:41.928 --> 07:43.929
When he broke into
that family's house

07:43.930 --> 07:45.297
and slept in the kid's bed.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.799
I handled episodes two
through four for Robert,

07:47.800 --> 07:50.134
so this sort of thing
is my specialty.

07:51.303 --> 07:55.074
Okay, just so it's said,
this house is flammable.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.775
I didn't mean
to burn down my house.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.478
Yeah, and I didn't mean
to eat my way into

07:59.479 --> 08:01.414
a ten-year shame spiral, but I did,

08:01.415 --> 08:03.949
and it's healthier
to acknowledge it.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.551
So, this flammable house

08:05.552 --> 08:08.421
belongs to one of Lola's
other fabulous clients,

08:08.422 --> 08:11.357
who is currently shooting
a pilot in Toronto.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.792
- An actor?
- Writer.

08:13.793 --> 08:16.862
So, for the next six weeks,
<i>su casa es su casa.</i>

08:18.598 --> 08:20.266
I say feel free to wear
his clothes.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.935
He'll probably get
a sick thrill out of it.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.103
The gays.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.471
He has dogs.

08:25.472 --> 08:27.773
Yeah, they're away at summer camp.

08:27.774 --> 08:28.939
Now, try the bed.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.149
It's fine.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.818
- Comfortable?
- Sure.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.455
Look, Gary, I know this has been

08:42.456 --> 08:45.357
crazy and stressful.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.461
I want you to feel
safe and comfortable.

08:48.462 --> 08:51.297
- I do.
- I'm a fan of yours, you know.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.265
Your number-one fan!

08:53.266 --> 08:55.267
But if you fuck this up,

08:55.268 --> 08:58.504
I will smash your ankles
with a sledgehammer.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.906
And that wouldn't be comfortable

09:00.907 --> 09:02.507
for either one of us.

09:04.243 --> 09:06.511
<i>Nine dogs ran</i>
<i>through the field.</i>

09:09.181 --> 09:11.148
The koala sits in the tree.

09:15.020 --> 09:16.855
It's computer voice-recognition.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.858
The parole system can call
you any time, day or night.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.860
If you don't pick up
within five rings,

09:21.861 --> 09:24.796
the police come
and haul your ass off.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.198
What if I'm not here?

09:27.434 --> 09:29.301
That's why they call it
"house arrest."

09:29.302 --> 09:32.169
You stay inside your house.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.373
He can take direction, I promise.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.110
I'll be coming by twice a day

09:38.111 --> 09:39.245
to check up on you.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.180
I should be the only
person coming by...

09:41.181 --> 09:44.250
no pals, no buddies,
no heroin dealers.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.651
I don't do heroin.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.120
Yeah, crack is classy. Mm.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.622
And I'm not buying you porn.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.457
There's spray-per-view on cable.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.626
Great, 'cause I really
wasn't concerned

09:53.627 --> 09:56.094
about my career, family, or future.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.796
I just wanted to jerk off.

09:57.797 --> 09:59.364
Ooh, let me see your phone.

10:01.634 --> 10:02.635
Oh!

10:03.736 --> 10:05.638
Come on, all my numbers
are in there.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.139
Dial ten digits at random.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.807
Whoever answers will be better

10:08.808 --> 10:10.376
than the people on that phone.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.610
You have my cell number.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.078
You have delivery menus.

10:13.079 --> 10:14.879
You're fine, right?

10:15.747 --> 10:16.881
Oh.

10:17.749 --> 10:19.116
Bad idea.

13:27.373 --> 13:28.505
Hello?

13:29.775 --> 13:31.241
Yes.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.911
Yes.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.782
Nine leopards ran
through the jungle.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.587
I bought two cakes at the store.

<i>The house is haunted.</i>

13:48.361 --> 13:50.629

13:50.630 --> 13:52.364
<i>Poltergeist, and no.</i>

13:52.365 --> 13:54.900
Maybe they were rats.
L.A.'s teeming with rats.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.368
They live in the palm trees.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.368
Uh, maybe.

13:59.738 --> 14:00.739
Okay, you know,

14:00.740 --> 14:02.808
I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

14:02.809 --> 14:03.876
Really?

14:03.877 --> 14:06.144
No, I'm a publicist.

14:06.145 --> 14:08.213
My job is what
other people think of you,

14:08.214 --> 14:09.848
not what you think of yourself,

14:09.849 --> 14:11.249
so pull your shit together.

14:11.250 --> 14:12.651
I am this close to getting

14:12.652 --> 14:15.053
Christine Walsh to do
your piece in <i>Parade.</i>

14:15.054 --> 14:17.456
<i>Parade?</i>
I fucking hate <i>Parade.</i>

14:17.457 --> 14:18.791
Everybody hates <i>Parade,</i>

14:18.792 --> 14:20.559
but the people
that watch <i>Crim9 Lab</i>

14:20.560 --> 14:22.561
love their Marilyn vos Savant.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.797
One heartfelt act of contrition,

14:24.798 --> 14:26.097
and maybe the show writer

14:26.098 --> 14:28.667
won't kill off your
character between seasons.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.069
I swear to God,
if you go bat-shit on me...

14:31.070 --> 14:32.438
I'm not crazy.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.506
Exactly. Exactly.

14:56.161 --> 14:58.696
Sorry! I'm sorry.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.867
Over here, to your left.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.135
Uh, right.
Sorry, right.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.271
I was practicing my putting,

15:06.272 --> 15:07.906
if you can believe that.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.106
Not really.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.646
Okay, maybe I was just looking

15:14.647 --> 15:16.648
for a way to meet
my infamous neighbor.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.116
Oh.

15:18.117 --> 15:20.285
You see, I'm under
house arrest, too.

15:20.286 --> 15:21.852
What'd you do?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.855
I had sex with my husband.

15:28.027 --> 15:29.661
That's awful.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.364
Nine months later, I had Jaden.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.565
That's her over there.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.501
She's a cutie.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.704
She's sleeping for another...

15:38.705 --> 15:40.305
Oh, 17 minutes.

15:40.306 --> 15:41.907
She likes to keep to a schedule.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.475
She seems really boring.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.743
She is.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.278
You're rich.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.349
Shouldn't you have
a nanny from Ecuador?

15:51.350 --> 15:53.051
I'm Canadian.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.052
Oh.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.921
Can't work in the U.S.

15:55.922 --> 15:57.823
Plus, I want to keep

15:57.824 --> 15:59.491
this air of moral superiority

15:59.492 --> 16:01.459
by doing everything myself.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.528
Very Canadian.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.660
Thanks.

16:08.266 --> 16:11.436
Jaden goes down again around 2:30.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.871
Maybe I could stop by?

16:12.872 --> 16:14.739
I'm pretty sure I'll be here.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.175
It's a date.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.675
Is it?

16:23.415 --> 16:26.350
- I'm Sarah, by the way.
- Gary.

16:27.318 --> 16:28.552
Yeah, I know.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.575
"The best of all possible worlds."

18:33.011 --> 18:34.412
Okay.

18:34.413 --> 18:35.747
Voltaire, <i>Candide.</i>

18:35.748 --> 18:37.748
Are you actually reading it?

18:38.717 --> 18:40.317
I thought I was.

18:41.219 --> 18:43.655
Sorry I bailed.
Jaden had a fever.

18:43.656 --> 18:45.389
How boring of her.

18:46.257 --> 18:47.659
Housewarming gift!

18:47.660 --> 18:49.961
Mmm. Demon liquor.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.730
And the best part
is I can drink it.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.364
I pumped before I came.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.834
So did I.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.736
It's hard to prove
that I was only trying

18:57.737 --> 19:00.338
to burn my ex-girlfriend's stuff
and not the entire house.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.440
Yeah, fire's tricky that way.

19:02.441 --> 19:04.810
Yeah. How 'bout you?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.911
Any history of arson?

19:07.779 --> 19:09.280
Strangely enough...

19:10.782 --> 19:13.018
I knew it. I could see
that little spark.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.552
Well, it wasn't arson, probably.

19:17.789 --> 19:20.358
When I was a little girl,
our house caught on fire.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.727
Oh, shit.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.095
I'll never forget the look

19:23.096 --> 19:24.362
on my father's face

19:24.363 --> 19:25.897
as he gathered me up in his arms

19:25.898 --> 19:27.933
and raced through
the burning building

19:27.934 --> 19:29.566
out onto the pavement.

19:30.568 --> 19:32.904
I stood there, shivering
in my pajamas,

19:32.905 --> 19:36.173
and watched the whole
world go up in flames.

19:37.475 --> 19:40.979
And when it was over,
I said to myself,

19:40.980 --> 19:45.050
"Is that all there is to a fire?"

19:45.051 --> 19:47.851
Is that all there is?

19:48.820 --> 19:52.624
<i>♪ Is that all there is?</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:56.327
<i>♪ Is that all there is?</i>

19:56.328 --> 20:00.132
<i>♪ If that's all there is,</i>

20:12.410 --> 20:19.716

20:20.852 --> 20:24.122
And then I met the most
wonderful boy in the world.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.958
We would take long walks
by the river.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.761
We'd sit for hours
gazing into each other's eyes.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.962
We were so very much in love.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.400
And then one day he went away,

20:35.401 --> 20:38.536
and I thought I'd die,
but I didn't.

20:38.537 --> 20:42.407
And when I didn't,
I said to myself,

20:42.408 --> 20:46.410
"Is that all there is to love?"

20:49.181 --> 20:53.084
<i>♪ Is that all there is</i>

20:53.085 --> 20:56.554

21:03.094 --> 21:04.629
I know what you're thinking.

21:04.630 --> 21:06.464
If that's the way
she feels about it,

21:06.465 --> 21:08.733
why doesn't she just end it all?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.235
Oh, no.

21:10.236 --> 21:11.303
I'm in no hurry

21:11.304 --> 21:14.572
for that final disappointment.

21:14.573 --> 21:17.342
I know as sure as I'm standing here

21:17.343 --> 21:19.110
talking to you,

21:19.111 --> 21:20.979
that when that final moment comes

21:20.980 --> 21:23.181
and I'm breathing my last breath,

21:23.182 --> 21:26.151
I'll be saying to myself...

21:26.152 --> 21:29.754
<i>♪ Is that all there is</i>

21:29.755 --> 21:33.725

21:53.746 --> 21:56.848
- I need to go.
- What?

21:56.849 --> 21:58.350
- Oh! Oh, sh...
- It's okay.

21:58.351 --> 21:59.717
Sorry, sorry.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.052
Where are my shoes?

22:01.053 --> 22:02.787
- Wait, just...
- Sorry.

22:02.788 --> 22:04.822
Don't worry about it. Just...

22:04.823 --> 22:07.458
I should go. Good-bye.

22:07.459 --> 22:08.658
You coming back?

23:47.994 --> 23:49.126
Hello?

23:50.295 --> 23:53.097
Yes. Yes.

23:54.565 --> 23:57.001
Two trains run through the forest.

24:03.176 --> 24:08.113
<i>Nine, nine,</i>
<i>nine, nine, nine...</i>

24:19.591 --> 24:21.492
Ow! Shit.

24:21.493 --> 24:23.127
Oh!

24:54.392 --> 24:55.892
Fuck.

25:01.432 --> 25:03.967
Jesus, you scared
the shit out of me.

25:08.606 --> 25:11.776
What... I don't...
I'm sorry.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.810
Oh, no, I'm...

25:14.846 --> 25:17.114
I'm fine.
I'll be fine, yeah.

25:19.817 --> 25:21.718
Where are your parents?

25:24.222 --> 25:25.623
No, no, no, your mom and dad.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.391
Where's your mom and dad?

25:30.262 --> 25:32.063
I don't know what you're saying.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.965
Look, hey, look,

25:33.966 --> 25:35.267
I don't speak that,

25:35.268 --> 25:39.404
so just go back to
wherever you came from.

25:39.405 --> 25:40.772
You shouldn't be out here.

25:40.773 --> 25:41.973
No, no, no. Go...

25:41.974 --> 25:43.741
It's not safe for
you to be out here.

25:43.742 --> 25:45.175
You should go back, okay?

25:52.718 --> 25:54.084
Oh, shit.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.430
Evening, Officers.

26:11.436 --> 26:13.305
Once again, house arrest

26:13.306 --> 26:15.941
means you stay inside your house.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.442
Think of it like
an electronic leash.

26:19.611 --> 26:20.678
If you even go more

26:20.679 --> 26:22.680
than 100 feet from
the base station,

26:22.681 --> 26:24.950
the cops come, and they
throw your ass in jail.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.118
If you ever try to take
it off, the cops come,

26:27.119 --> 26:28.719
and they throw your ass in jail.

26:28.720 --> 26:31.589
If they ever detect drugs or
alcohol in your system...

26:31.590 --> 26:34.059
Cops come.
Throw my ass in jail.

26:34.060 --> 26:37.128
No, I kick your ass.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.364
Then the cops come and
throw your ass in jail.

26:39.365 --> 26:40.999
Do I still have
to answer the phone?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.434
No, I'll be doing that from now on.

26:42.435 --> 26:43.868
I'm moving into the guest room.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.370
I don't need a babysitter.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.573
Despite all
evidence to the contrary.

26:48.574 --> 26:50.541
Don't worry, I'm a cool roomie.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.710
Who do you think taught
Affleck how to gamble?

26:59.318 --> 27:02.020
Let's never hear that again! Hmm?

27:02.021 --> 27:06.491
ninety-seven,
ninety-eight, ninety-nine.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.425
One hundred feet.

27:10.828 --> 27:13.365
Behold, the edge of your world.

27:13.366 --> 27:15.533
In the world, out of the world.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.135
In the world, out of the world...

27:17.136 --> 27:18.669
In the world, out of the world.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.906
In the world, out of the world.
Hey, I'm dancing!

27:21.907 --> 27:25.377
Huh?

27:25.378 --> 27:27.178
Sure, absolutely.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.814
So the guy's like,
"Do you know fencing?"

27:29.815 --> 27:32.350
And I say, "That's what it
says on my headshot."

27:32.351 --> 27:35.086
- Lies.
- Oh, always. Always.

27:35.087 --> 27:38.089
So he says to me,
"Foil or <i>'epi'?"</i>

27:38.090 --> 27:40.591
- Epée!
- And I say I'm about equal in both...

27:40.592 --> 27:42.160
- Which is true!
- Exactly.

27:42.161 --> 27:45.663
Anyway, he throws me this
fucking Conan sword, right?

27:45.664 --> 27:49.401
And then he just
starts going after me.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.169
- Oh, my gosh!
- I'm just swinging.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.937
I'm just trying
to stay alive, right,

27:52.938 --> 27:54.105
with my eyes closed,

27:54.106 --> 27:56.441
and I end up accidentally
cutting his ear.

27:56.442 --> 27:57.675
You cut off his ear?

27:57.676 --> 28:00.045
Yeah... well, no, no,
just a little, right.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.846
But I ended up getting the job.

28:01.847 --> 28:04.249
Wait, you were in
<i>Pirates of the Caribbean?</i>

28:04.250 --> 28:06.217
Yeah. No, no.

28:06.218 --> 28:08.319
No, not the movie, the ride.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.088
I was all, like,

28:10.089 --> 28:12.623
"Arr, keep both hands
inside the boat."

28:12.624 --> 28:14.492
- Ew!
- You.

28:14.493 --> 28:16.761
Don't. No finger.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.396
Good night, fuckface.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.063
Good night, you filthy whore.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.173
It's incredible.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.474
Whenever I see them,

28:29.475 --> 28:32.544
I always feel like... damn.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.412
I was born at the wrong time.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.247
Exactly.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.535

29:30.536 --> 29:32.504
Everyone needs affection.
I get it.

29:32.505 --> 29:35.206
I don't. Are you seriously jealous?

29:35.207 --> 29:36.608

29:36.609 --> 29:38.343
I just want to protect her.

29:38.344 --> 29:41.379
- From what?
- From you.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.148
Look at you.
You date models,

29:43.149 --> 29:45.350
actresses, tennis players.

29:45.351 --> 29:46.417
Yeah?

29:46.418 --> 29:47.818
On a scale of one to ten,

29:47.819 --> 29:49.720
you belong with the nines.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.988

"Look for the nines"?

30:08.239 --> 30:09.641
It's not mine.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.677
- It's your handwriting.
- I didn't write it.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.045
Okay.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.158
Allee... allee... all come free.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.328
What?

30:33.798 --> 30:35.032
Nothing.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.867
Seriously. What?

30:37.735 --> 30:40.437
Nothing.
I thought you were...

30:41.573 --> 30:45.542
Forget it. Done. Sorry.

31:04.329 --> 31:07.632
Hiya. Hi.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.799
What?

31:09.800 --> 31:11.636
I have to take this.

31:11.637 --> 31:13.238
Who thought it was a good idea

31:13.239 --> 31:15.338
to let Courtney
into a pottery shop?

32:03.521 --> 32:05.021
I know who you are.

32:08.192 --> 32:10.861
- Really.
- I know what you are.

32:10.862 --> 32:12.330
If you come near him again...

32:12.331 --> 32:13.763
You'll what?

32:15.266 --> 32:17.935
What are you gonna
do about it, mm...

32:17.936 --> 32:21.606
sorry, what's he calling you?

32:21.607 --> 32:22.873
Margaret.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.243
I like that.
Margaret. Classic.

32:26.244 --> 32:27.779
Why don't you leave him alone?

32:27.780 --> 32:31.182
Alone? He can't be left alone.
He's an actor.

32:31.183 --> 32:32.784
If no one's watching him,

32:32.785 --> 32:34.951
he doesn't really exist.

32:35.853 --> 32:37.687
And for the record...

32:39.023 --> 32:41.925
I'm not the one deceiving him.

32:42.860 --> 32:44.562
He'll figure it out eventually,

32:44.563 --> 32:47.263
and when he does, who do you
think he's going to blame?

33:05.750 --> 33:07.383
Good night, rat face.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.452
Good night.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.632
Hey, neighbor.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.872
Sorry for the psychotic episode.

34:00.873 --> 34:02.238
Okay.

34:03.107 --> 34:04.208
Are you okay?

34:04.209 --> 34:06.943
You look a little
"Beautiful Mind" -ish.

34:08.978 --> 34:11.848
How many times should
the number nine come up?

34:12.917 --> 34:14.217
Probablistically?

34:14.219 --> 34:16.521
Uh, "probablistically"?

34:16.522 --> 34:18.254
You know what I mean.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.426
One time out of ten.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.525
How about every time?

34:25.129 --> 34:28.098
But they only show up
when you look for them.

34:28.099 --> 34:31.333
Looking for them changes things.

34:33.704 --> 34:35.005
Some of these are prices,

34:35.005 --> 34:36.774
and there's gonna be
a lot of nines.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.208
There's something wrong.

34:40.545 --> 34:42.779
There's something wrong
with the world.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.719
I can get you out of here,

34:48.719 --> 34:50.521
but you have to trust me.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.455
Good morning.

34:54.324 --> 34:55.591
Everything okay?

34:56.561 --> 34:57.829
Peachy.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.964
Peachy's good.
I like peaches.

34:59.965 --> 35:03.901
You want coffee?

35:03.902 --> 35:06.335
Uh, yeah. Eh.

35:14.545 --> 35:16.546
What do I do?

35:17.482 --> 35:19.415
Do you trust me?

35:33.297 --> 35:34.497
Gary?

35:37.134 --> 35:38.736
You okay?

35:38.737 --> 35:40.638
No.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.873
Oh?

35:41.874 --> 35:43.440
Tell me about the nines.

35:43.441 --> 35:45.543
The nines?

35:45.544 --> 35:47.010
The nines.

35:48.245 --> 35:49.947
It's sort of hard to start there.

35:49.948 --> 35:54.201
Try, and don't tell me
I'm imagining it,

35:54.202 --> 35:56.170
'cause they're
showing up everywhere,

35:56.171 --> 35:57.537
and I want to know why.

35:58.605 --> 35:59.941
Best guess?

35:59.942 --> 36:02.143
They're your subconscious

36:02.144 --> 36:04.777
trying to remind you who you are.

36:08.115 --> 36:09.883
I'm a nine?

36:09.884 --> 36:11.319
Yes.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.220
Doesn't make much sense
out of context.

36:15.622 --> 36:17.591
You're not gonna
understand this yet,

36:17.592 --> 36:19.927
but... we've known each other

36:19.928 --> 36:22.028
for, like, 25 years.

36:23.297 --> 36:25.666
One day when I was 12,

36:25.667 --> 36:27.969
you called me out of the blue

36:27.970 --> 36:30.671
and we've been talking ever since.

36:30.672 --> 36:32.773
Talking.

36:32.774 --> 36:35.343
On the phone, usually.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.610
I never met you before I came here.

36:39.813 --> 36:42.649
You, Gary, never met me, no,

36:42.650 --> 36:46.553
but you're not always...

36:46.554 --> 36:47.688
I can understand

36:47.689 --> 36:49.423
why you're a little confused.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.023
No, no.

36:51.892 --> 36:54.827
I'm a lot confused.

37:08.075 --> 37:09.342
Theories?

37:10.211 --> 37:12.812
- This is all a dream?
- No.

37:15.383 --> 37:18.551
- I'm in a coma?
- No.

37:21.055 --> 37:23.524
Then I'm dead?

37:23.525 --> 37:27.361
This is hell or a
purgatorium or something?

37:27.362 --> 37:30.797
Okay, purgatorium is
where Romans vomited,

37:30.798 --> 37:36.037
but no, this is as real
as anything can be.

37:36.038 --> 37:37.804
What does that mean?

37:37.805 --> 37:40.341
Everything is what it is,

37:40.342 --> 37:43.276
but you're not who
you think you are.

37:45.246 --> 37:49.016
God, no, Gary, please don't.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.318
You can't trust her. She's a nine.

37:51.319 --> 37:53.654
You don't know what you're doing.

37:53.655 --> 37:57.091
Okay, so what happens
if I cross this line?

37:57.092 --> 37:59.925
I don't know, but it's not good.

38:12.706 --> 38:13.874
Oh, shit.

38:29.557 --> 38:32.593
<i>Previously</i>
<i>on "Behind the Screen"...</i>

38:32.594 --> 38:33.961
<i>Gavin Taylor is one</i>

38:33.962 --> 38:35.796
<i>of the best TV writers</i>
<i>out there.</i>

38:35.797 --> 38:38.432
<i>Every network would kill</i>
<i>to work with him.</i>

38:38.433 --> 38:40.368
- Good to see you! Mwah.
- You look wonderful.

38:40.369 --> 38:41.535
<i>My name's Gavin Taylor.</i>

38:41.536 --> 38:43.203
<i>I'm a film</i>
<i>and television writer.</i>

38:43.204 --> 38:45.406
<i>Knowing</i> is a one-hour drama

38:45.407 --> 38:47.608
about a woman
whose husband disappears.

38:47.609 --> 38:50.411
She believes that her daughter
is the key to a dark conspiracy.

38:50.412 --> 38:52.280
Even way back
into <i>The Fugitive,</i>

38:52.281 --> 38:54.181
where they didn't
have the full setup

38:54.182 --> 38:56.116
and the payoff in each episode.

38:56.117 --> 38:58.786
<i>Knowing</i> is not
gonna be <i>Crim9 Lab,</i>

38:58.787 --> 39:00.721
not the popular kind
of mystery shows

39:00.722 --> 39:02.323
that are out there, today,

39:02.324 --> 39:03.991
where we get all the answers.

39:03.992 --> 39:06.026
trying to figure out how long

39:06.027 --> 39:08.262
is the attention span
of today's audience.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.430
So, boil it down for me.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.766
Give me one line that we can really

39:11.767 --> 39:13.534
set Roger on fire with, here.

39:13.535 --> 39:17.336
Basically, it's like
<i>Rosemary's Toddler.</i>

39:20.541 --> 39:23.209
My favorite movie.
That's my favorite film.

39:26.013 --> 39:28.482
We sold it in the room.

39:28.483 --> 39:30.384
Just tell me Roger
liked the script.

39:30.385 --> 39:31.686
You're shooting a pilot.

39:31.687 --> 39:33.220
<i>Melissa McCarthy is my first</i>

39:33.221 --> 39:34.822
<i>and only choice</i>
<i>for the lead.</i>

39:34.823 --> 39:37.356
writing a show for you.
For you.

39:38.359 --> 39:39.960
- Really?
- Yes.

39:39.961 --> 39:42.830
<i>Gavin and I</i>
<i>have been friends forever.</i>

39:42.831 --> 39:45.366
<i>It's delightful to be</i>
<i>working on</i> Knowing,

39:45.367 --> 39:47.368
and it's, you know,
not surprisingly,

39:47.369 --> 39:49.704
<i>a fantastic script,</i>
<i>and it's a great cast.</i>

39:49.705 --> 39:51.539
Gilmore Girls
<i>has been great,</i>

39:51.540 --> 39:53.574
<i>but, you know,</i>
<i>I'm excited to go</i>

39:53.575 --> 39:56.510
<i>and to have something</i>
<i>this great to go into.</i>

39:56.511 --> 39:58.646
I totally trust Gavin.

39:58.647 --> 40:02.082
<i>The only way we can afford
to shoot the pilot is in Canada.</i>

40:02.083 --> 40:04.752
- I can't believe we're shooting it...
- A 15-day shoot versus...

40:04.753 --> 40:06.554
This is not an argument
I'm going to win.

40:06.555 --> 40:10.189
<i>It's really hard to think</i>
<i>about leaving for six weeks.</i>

40:12.460 --> 40:15.195
Puggies.

40:15.196 --> 40:16.397
Action.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.491
<i>♪ Through the back door</i>

40:34.849 --> 40:36.749
<i>♪ Through the back door</i>

40:40.087 --> 40:41.889
Puggies!

40:44.726 --> 40:45.960
Where's your brother?

40:45.961 --> 40:48.562
<i>It's just</i>
<i>so weird being back.</i>

40:48.563 --> 40:51.431
<i>It just doesn't feel</i>
<i>like my house anymore.</i>

41:18.492 --> 41:19.593
<i>At this stage,</i>

41:19.594 --> 41:21.295
<i>you have the script</i>
<i>that you wrote</i>

41:21.296 --> 41:22.763
<i>and the film that you shot,</i>

41:22.764 --> 41:24.832
<i>but you don't know how</i>
<i>it's gonna come together.</i>

41:24.833 --> 41:26.866
You just know how
you want it to feel.

41:39.046 --> 41:40.314
<i>Be careful.</i>

41:40.315 --> 41:42.715
<i>Understand?</i>
<i>You have to use big girl hands.</i>

41:43.918 --> 41:45.752
<i>You want to see</i>
<i>where we were today?</i>

41:45.753 --> 41:48.587
<i>Okay, hit play.</i>
<i>This button.</i>

41:49.489 --> 41:51.525
<i>Look!</i>

41:51.526 --> 41:55.296
<i>There's you</i>
<i>and there's Daddy.</i>

41:55.297 --> 41:57.830
<i>Oh, a little movie star, huh?</i>

42:01.836 --> 42:04.904
<i>Oh, he'll be back soon.</i>
<i>Don't you worry.</i>

42:07.942 --> 42:10.744
I don't know if we
need the cold open.

42:10.745 --> 42:13.747
I think we want to get
right to the story.

42:13.748 --> 42:17.117
- The story's so strong.
- Excuse me?

42:17.118 --> 42:19.019
Is there any way we
could be more clear

42:19.020 --> 42:21.155
about why Mary's so freaked
out at that moment?

42:21.156 --> 42:26.760
Wow... I think it's
pretty obvious and dramatic.

42:26.761 --> 42:28.963
It is, it's dramatic,
but, you know,

42:28.964 --> 42:30.898
that's Roger's
big thing this season,

42:30.899 --> 42:32.833
is never let
the audience be confused.

42:32.834 --> 42:36.603
Oh, my God, that's just
a huge thing to remove.

42:36.604 --> 42:39.340
No, it's just, you know,
let's see it without it.

42:39.341 --> 42:42.743
Humor. You know, life is full of
funny little strange moments.

42:42.744 --> 42:46.280
I'm just wondering if there could
be, like, not a belly laugh...

42:46.281 --> 42:47.948
I invited Susan to see a rough cut

42:47.949 --> 42:49.350
because I trust her taste.

42:49.351 --> 42:50.851
More importantly,

42:50.852 --> 42:53.620
I trust her as a barometer
of Roger's taste.

42:53.621 --> 42:55.521
to give the audience a little...

42:57.758 --> 43:00.094
Uh, yeah, I mean...

43:00.095 --> 43:02.829
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>in this process,</i>

43:02.830 --> 43:05.065
it comes down to the decision
of one person,

43:05.066 --> 43:06.466
and that person's Roger.

43:06.467 --> 43:08.468
<i>I was thinking</i>
<i>we could all go down</i>

43:08.469 --> 43:10.637
<i>to El Cholo</i>
<i>for dinner tonight.</i>

43:10.638 --> 43:13.607
<i>How do you feel about</i>
<i>some blue corn enchiladas?</i>

43:13.608 --> 43:15.808
<i>Should we ask Daddy</i>
<i>when he gets back?</i>

43:18.312 --> 43:20.379
<i>He's not coming back.</i>

43:21.648 --> 43:23.550
Okay, stop.

43:23.551 --> 43:25.852
We just need to slip
a wild line for you

43:25.853 --> 43:27.087
over the shot of Noelle.

43:27.088 --> 43:28.155
What's the line?

43:28.156 --> 43:29.223
"How could you."

43:29.224 --> 43:32.192
- How could you.
- How could you.

43:32.193 --> 43:34.661
It sounds like kosher
drug paraphernalia.

43:34.662 --> 43:35.729
"Hey, Schmuley!

43:35.730 --> 43:37.764
Have a hook on the Hookajew."

43:37.765 --> 43:40.833
I know. It's just
for the test screening.

43:42.836 --> 43:44.939
They really think
people won't get it?

43:44.940 --> 43:46.972
The dumb people might not.

43:47.874 --> 43:49.343
I didn't think we were making

43:49.344 --> 43:50.677
the show for dumb people.

43:50.678 --> 43:52.246
Yeah.

43:52.247 --> 43:53.580
<i>He's not coming back.</i>

43:55.683 --> 43:57.151
How could you?

43:57.152 --> 43:58.917
How could you?!

43:59.786 --> 44:01.088
How could you.

44:01.089 --> 44:02.688
How could you.

44:03.557 --> 44:04.691
How <i>could</i> you...?

44:04.692 --> 44:06.660
- One more.
- How could you?

44:06.661 --> 44:07.727
Cut. Perfect.

44:07.728 --> 44:09.096
I feel so dirty.

44:09.097 --> 44:10.431
That's how I like it.

44:10.432 --> 44:12.466
Uh!

44:12.467 --> 44:13.832
I like that one.

44:17.254 --> 44:19.189
I want to thank you all
very much for coming.

44:19.190 --> 44:22.592
The show is "Knowing."
It's a brand-new pilot.

44:22.593 --> 44:24.028
Here, in this audience today,

44:24.029 --> 44:26.096
you are the very first
people to see it,

44:26.097 --> 44:28.432
and after it's over,
I will come back here

44:28.433 --> 44:30.901
and we'll all fill out a
comment card on our thoughts.

44:30.902 --> 44:32.935
That being said, enjoy the show.

44:47.317 --> 44:49.653
Please take as much time
as you like.

44:49.654 --> 44:51.355
There's no rush
with this whatsoever.

44:51.356 --> 44:52.622
When you are finished,

44:52.623 --> 44:55.325
we're gonna break
into two separate groups...

44:55.326 --> 44:58.026
men and women...
and then we'll discuss.

44:59.430 --> 45:02.399
One of the most important
things in any new show

45:02.400 --> 45:04.701
is how you feel
about the characters.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.171
If you like the characters,

45:07.172 --> 45:09.306
you're more likely
to tune in next week.

45:09.307 --> 45:11.275
Let's find out about
these characters.

45:11.276 --> 45:13.210
<i>Show of hands...</i>
<i>how many of you liked</i>

45:13.211 --> 45:15.079
<i>the character of Gabriel?</i>

45:15.080 --> 45:17.847
<i>One, two, three,</i>
<i>four, five, six.</i>

45:17.848 --> 45:19.516
<i>How 'bout Mary?</i>

45:19.517 --> 45:22.286
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

45:22.287 --> 45:23.486
<i>Noelle?</i>

45:24.821 --> 45:27.157
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

45:27.158 --> 45:28.358
So, it's everybody.

45:28.359 --> 45:29.558
Sierra?

45:30.427 --> 45:33.029
<i>One, two, three, four. Ah.</i>

45:33.030 --> 45:34.898
That's it?

45:34.899 --> 45:37.534
<i>Is there anything confusing</i>
<i>in the storyline</i>

45:37.535 --> 45:39.769
<i>that's not resolved for you?</i>

45:39.770 --> 45:41.905
Look at this guy.
This guy hasn't budged.

45:41.906 --> 45:42.973
His eyes are shut.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.774
That's helpful.
Thank you.

45:44.775 --> 45:46.910
I hate it in movies
and TV shows when they

45:46.911 --> 45:49.546
leave the car windows down
when they totally wouldn't.

45:49.547 --> 45:52.249
- So they can see the camera?
- What's the difference.

45:52.250 --> 45:53.584
Want to see the camera?

45:53.585 --> 45:55.852
<i>Was this an issue</i>
<i>for anybody else?</i>

45:55.853 --> 45:57.787
One.

45:57.788 --> 45:59.289
Any other confusions?

45:59.290 --> 46:02.792
Yeah. Was the little girl deaf
or was she just mute?

46:02.793 --> 46:04.495
Oh!

46:04.496 --> 46:07.464
Is the little girl deaf or
mute... is she deaf or mute?

46:07.465 --> 46:09.233
I'm saying what would
you say to him?

46:09.234 --> 46:10.734
I'm not saying I don't know.

46:10.735 --> 46:14.271
Come on. We're not signing
to her, she's signing to us.

46:14.272 --> 46:15.672
We're just speaking to her,

46:15.673 --> 46:17.341
and she seems
to understand it.

46:17.342 --> 46:19.276
I thought that was quite clear.

46:19.277 --> 46:20.876
That guy's staring at me.

46:22.078 --> 46:23.946
He can't see you.

46:25.849 --> 46:27.784
God, he's staring at me.

46:27.785 --> 46:30.018
I just waved,
and he nodded his head.

46:32.289 --> 46:35.524
He can't see you.
Can't see us.

46:37.461 --> 46:40.164
Susan, he's looking right at me.

46:40.165 --> 46:41.598
You didn't raise your hand

46:41.599 --> 46:43.233
to any questions.
Any thoughts?

46:43.234 --> 46:44.268
It's not real.

46:44.269 --> 46:45.269
What does that mean?

46:45.270 --> 46:46.336
The show's not real.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.104
Why can't you see that?
Jesus!

46:48.105 --> 46:50.073
What, are you fucking blind?!

46:50.074 --> 46:52.242
<i>You think you're</i>
<i>above this, don't you?</i>

46:52.243 --> 46:55.345
<i>You are trapped here</i>
<i>with the rest of us, brother.</i>

46:55.346 --> 46:57.514
<i>Get out. Get out!</i>

46:57.515 --> 46:59.582
<i>Oblivio accebit!</i>

47:08.058 --> 47:09.792
Oh, my God.

47:10.827 --> 47:12.128
You okay?

47:12.129 --> 47:13.896
Yeah, but what was that?

47:15.232 --> 47:17.534
Oh, my God.

47:17.535 --> 47:18.435
I don't know.

47:18.436 --> 47:20.837
The guy was crazy,
clearly, I just...

47:20.838 --> 47:22.706
I mean, the show's
a little bit twisted,

47:22.707 --> 47:24.974
so maybe it flipped something
in him, I don't know.

47:24.975 --> 47:26.577
What did he say?

47:26.578 --> 47:30.547
He said, <i>"Oblivio accebit."</i>

47:30.548 --> 47:33.916
It's Latin, "oblivion approaches."

47:34.818 --> 47:36.220
What does that mean?

47:36.221 --> 47:39.556
Other than the world
is coming to an end?

47:39.557 --> 47:42.492
<i>"Oblivio"</i> can also
mean, uh, forgetting.

47:42.493 --> 47:44.159
Forgetfulness.

47:47.765 --> 47:49.600
But I think that's
what I'm gonna do.

47:49.601 --> 47:51.301
Forget it.

47:51.302 --> 47:53.870
<i>He was a terrible comedian
and his mom ran the Improv.</i>

47:53.871 --> 47:55.339
<i>Oh, my God,</i>
<i>Pauly Shore.</i>

47:55.340 --> 47:57.040
You're not helping me at all!

48:00.978 --> 48:03.780
Designer that was unfortunately
killed in Miami outside of his house.

48:03.781 --> 48:04.981
Gianni Versace!

48:05.983 --> 48:07.484
One word for both of them.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.453
Br-Brangelina.

48:09.454 --> 48:11.355
Oh, uh...

48:11.356 --> 48:13.956
This is a hard one,
and I don't know how to do it.

48:15.592 --> 48:18.194
You're giving...
you and I should switch,

48:18.195 --> 48:20.597
because that's... you're...

48:24.335 --> 48:26.870
three weeks later.
I remember that.

48:33.644 --> 48:36.045
Did you have a chance to
look at those cards yet?

48:36.046 --> 48:37.881
From the screening?

48:37.882 --> 48:40.717
Pardon me. Ooh!

48:40.718 --> 48:43.353
- Daddy needs a drink.
- Help yourself then.

48:43.354 --> 48:45.188
Hey, woman!
Where's my drink?

48:45.189 --> 48:47.391
I'm-a comin'!

48:47.392 --> 48:49.326
But I still love you most.

48:49.327 --> 48:51.395
People will write
things on those cards

48:51.396 --> 48:53.297
that they won't say
in a focus group.

48:53.298 --> 48:54.964
They get more specific.

48:54.965 --> 48:57.734
Roger says, you know,
forget about the people

48:57.735 --> 48:59.736
who score you
in the twos and threes,

48:59.737 --> 49:01.838
because they're never
gonna like your show.

49:01.839 --> 49:04.240
Instead, look for the nines.

49:04.241 --> 49:05.742
The nines.

49:05.743 --> 49:08.077
They're the ones
who think your show

49:08.078 --> 49:10.314
is almost the best thing
they've ever seen.

49:10.315 --> 49:11.381
They get your vision,

49:11.382 --> 49:13.350
they just want it to be better.

49:13.351 --> 49:16.286
Round two is
starting without you!

49:16.287 --> 49:19.323
- You gonna look at those cards?
- Absolutely.

49:19.324 --> 49:20.455
- Yeah?
- Yep.

49:40.677 --> 49:42.546
Sometimes the numbers
point things out

49:42.547 --> 49:44.681
that you didn't want
to admit to yourself,

49:44.682 --> 49:46.850
and in this case, it's Melissa.

49:46.851 --> 49:48.719
Well, her overall scores were okay,

49:48.720 --> 49:51.788
but if you look at the people
who scored the show the highest,

49:51.789 --> 49:54.825
the one consistent dip was Melissa.

49:54.826 --> 49:57.327
There's some sort
of subtle undertones

49:57.328 --> 49:59.295
of negativity there.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.997
Well, Gavin, the show is testing

50:00.998 --> 50:02.466
very well in the Midwest,

50:02.467 --> 50:04.234
but it's not doing well
in the urban areas,

50:04.235 --> 50:06.770
and it's not doing well with men.

50:06.771 --> 50:08.204
We've got a major problem,

50:08.205 --> 50:09.239
and I really need you

50:09.240 --> 50:10.707
to think about this with me.

50:10.708 --> 50:12.909
It's Melissa,

50:12.910 --> 50:14.845
and it's just what I
thought it was gonna be.

50:14.846 --> 50:16.980
If you'd read the cards,
you'd understand.

50:16.981 --> 50:19.549
I read some of the cards, but I
don't believe in that stuff.

50:19.550 --> 50:23.319
I don't believe you can let
these armchair quarterbacks...

50:23.320 --> 50:25.154
They're not connecting to Melissa.

50:25.155 --> 50:26.723
And I love her.
She's so strong.

50:26.724 --> 50:28.392
I am with you
on the fact that she is

50:28.393 --> 50:29.760
not your traditional lead

50:29.761 --> 50:31.327
of a network television show.

50:31.328 --> 50:33.229
She doesn't have a ton
to do in the pilot.

50:33.230 --> 50:34.765
There's so much to set it up.

50:34.766 --> 50:37.100
That's one of the challenges
of the premise pilot.

50:37.101 --> 50:38.968
But the network
still likes the show.

50:38.969 --> 50:40.804
Roger is your biggest cheerleader.

50:40.805 --> 50:42.272
Okay, how about above Roger?

50:42.273 --> 50:44.040
Roger's calling the shots on this.

50:44.041 --> 50:47.076
But we all know that Roger
consults with the "higher powers."

50:47.077 --> 50:49.012
- That is true.
- They tell him what to do.

50:49.013 --> 50:51.581
- I'm wondering if they liked the show.
- They haven't seen it.

50:51.582 --> 50:54.083
They're gonna watch all
of the pilots on Friday.

50:54.084 --> 50:55.685
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

50:55.686 --> 50:57.487
I want to have...

50:57.488 --> 50:58.955
something to present to them...

50:58.956 --> 51:00.689
Why are you focusing on Melissa?

51:02.025 --> 51:03.627
She's our biggest concern.

51:03.628 --> 51:05.595
She's also the biggest
star on the show.

51:05.596 --> 51:06.663
No, no, no.

51:06.664 --> 51:08.131
You are the biggest star.

51:08.132 --> 51:09.800
Roger has a huge deal with you,

51:09.801 --> 51:11.701
and he went along
with casting Melissa

51:11.702 --> 51:13.369
when it was against his instinct.

51:13.370 --> 51:14.471
Hooray for Roger.

51:14.472 --> 51:17.340
I don't understand
what you want me to do.

51:17.341 --> 51:18.641
Meet with someone.

51:19.543 --> 51:22.479
- Who?
- Dahlia Salem.

51:23.481 --> 51:25.081
I know you like her.

51:25.082 --> 51:27.517
Oh, God.
Are you kidding me?

51:27.518 --> 51:29.820
The network has a huge
holding deal with her.

51:29.821 --> 51:32.522
Yes, and they put her
in Gatins' pilot.

51:32.523 --> 51:35.124
That's dead.
I mean, it's dying.

51:35.125 --> 51:37.461
But the network, they love Dahlia,

51:37.462 --> 51:39.663
so if she could just
jump into your show...

51:39.664 --> 51:40.997
Just jump over to my show?

51:40.998 --> 51:42.566
There's no such thing...

51:42.567 --> 51:44.367
there's re-shooting the pilot,

51:44.368 --> 51:47.003
and I brought this up
months and months ago.

51:47.004 --> 51:49.005
You guys kept pushing
other people on me,

51:49.006 --> 51:51.675
and I kept saying Melissa,
Melissa, Melissa.

51:51.676 --> 51:53.276
You kept pushing Melissa on us,

51:53.277 --> 51:54.644
and now we have a problem.

51:54.645 --> 51:55.645
You're very lucky

51:55.646 --> 51:57.246
in that Roger will pay for this.

51:57.247 --> 51:58.715
Roger is willing
to re-shoot

51:58.716 --> 52:01.083
this entire fucking thing.

52:02.819 --> 52:04.486
Is this really about Melissa?

52:06.189 --> 52:11.060
This is about getting your
show on the air, right?

52:11.061 --> 52:12.662
I need you to focus on that.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.629
In the end, that's
all that matters.

52:16.399 --> 52:18.300
That's my job.

52:19.235 --> 52:21.204
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

52:21.205 --> 52:23.773
- Well, nice to...
- Thank you for doing this.

52:23.774 --> 52:26.476
I've been looking forward
to this, actually.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.879
- I have a question:
- Yes?

52:28.880 --> 52:30.680
Is it "Dalia" or "Dahlia"?

52:30.681 --> 52:32.682
Thank you for asking.
It's "Dalia."

52:32.683 --> 52:34.117
- Dalia. I knew it!
- You did?

52:34.118 --> 52:36.085
I contested this
with someone earlier.

52:36.086 --> 52:37.186
Well, good.

52:37.187 --> 52:38.421
We have the same birthday.

52:38.422 --> 52:39.623
I looked you up on the IMDb.

52:39.624 --> 52:41.324
I wanted to see everything you...
What?

52:41.325 --> 52:42.626
Yes, we have the same birthday!

52:42.627 --> 52:44.293
Same year, same day, everything.

52:44.294 --> 52:46.229
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding you.

52:46.230 --> 52:48.164
- Isn't that cool?
- That's insane.

52:48.165 --> 52:50.534
- Yeah, November 21st.
- Oh, my God.

52:50.535 --> 52:53.537
So you're completely
and utterly crazy, too!

52:53.538 --> 52:55.171
She works more than me!

52:55.172 --> 52:56.840
That's the thing that's killing me,

52:56.841 --> 52:59.709
because she gave up
<i>Gilmore Girls</i> to do this show.

52:59.710 --> 53:01.310
She's a very strong character,

53:01.311 --> 53:03.446
and I'm attracted to strong roles.

53:03.447 --> 53:06.215
Yeah, I'm hoping
to fill her out even more,

53:06.216 --> 53:07.651
and obviously collaborate

53:07.652 --> 53:10.554
with the person that's playing her.

53:10.555 --> 53:13.489
<i>I mean, I see why</i>
<i>the network loves her.</i>

53:13.490 --> 53:15.892
<i>She's adorable,</i>
<i>but it's just that in my head,</i>

53:15.893 --> 53:18.028
<i>you know, I wrote</i>
<i>the role for Melissa.</i>

53:18.029 --> 53:19.495
<i>She's one</i>
<i>of my best friends,</i>

53:19.496 --> 53:21.631
<i>and I can only imagine</i>
<i>it with her.</i>

53:21.632 --> 53:23.165
Could Dahlia do it?

53:24.034 --> 53:26.703
Absolutely.
She's terrific.

53:26.704 --> 53:29.471
It could work, I just don't
know if I want it to work.

53:30.640 --> 53:33.543
<i>When I get stressed out,</i>
<i>I play videogames.</i>

53:33.544 --> 53:34.711
<i>It's my therapy.</i>

53:34.712 --> 53:36.479
<i>Can't have them</i>
<i>on my computer at home</i>

53:36.480 --> 53:38.582
<i>'cause then I'd never write,</i>
<i>so I come to Koreatown.</i>

53:38.583 --> 53:40.416
<i>I mean, I love these games</i>
<i>that you can kind of...</i>

53:40.417 --> 53:42.185
<i>lose yourself</i>
<i>a little bit in them.</i>

53:42.186 --> 53:43.887
<i>I love that it's</i>
<i>a different world</i>

53:43.888 --> 53:45.722
<i>that's existing</i>
<i>at the same time.</i>

53:45.723 --> 53:47.323
<i>They're better</i>
<i>than real life,</i>

53:47.324 --> 53:51.394
because when you get stuck,
you can always hit "reset."

53:51.395 --> 53:54.464
That's what life needs.
Needs a reset button.

53:54.465 --> 53:56.665
I have to let Melissa go.

53:58.735 --> 54:01.304
What happens if
you don't let Melissa go?

54:01.305 --> 54:03.205
If I don't let Melissa go?
Um...

54:04.107 --> 54:07.811
Well...

54:07.812 --> 54:09.778
My world ends, so...

54:10.647 --> 54:12.616
I can't let that happen.

54:12.617 --> 54:14.117
<i>If we're gonna</i>
<i>replace Melissa,</i>

54:14.118 --> 54:15.485
<i>I want to hear it</i>

54:15.486 --> 54:16.920
Roger's on a plane to London,

54:16.921 --> 54:18.755
but I talked with him
before he left,

54:18.756 --> 54:20.056
and he said yes on Dahlia.

54:20.057 --> 54:21.725
<i>What does that mean?</i>

54:21.726 --> 54:23.760
<i>It means yes.</i>

54:23.761 --> 54:25.294
Yes, replace Melissa?

54:25.295 --> 54:29.465
Roger wants your show
on the air starring Dahlia,

54:29.466 --> 54:30.900
and I just got off the phone

54:30.901 --> 54:33.236
with her agents, and they love it,

54:33.237 --> 54:34.537
<i>and she loves, loves you.</i>

54:34.538 --> 54:35.605
What about Melissa?

54:35.606 --> 54:38.642

54:38.643 --> 54:40.309

56:59.348 --> 57:04.552
<i>♪ The people</i>
<i>are more every day ♪</i>

57:06.622 --> 57:08.825
Then he's like,
"I'm straight, remember?"

57:08.826 --> 57:11.194
Suddenly stricken with
some sort of gay panic.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.796
"I'm your straight husband."

57:12.797 --> 57:15.999
- You can throw color swatches at me.
- I know. Oh, I will.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.268
I think my house is haunted.

57:19.270 --> 57:21.404
Well, your house is really old.

57:21.405 --> 57:22.538
Ever since I got back,

57:22.539 --> 57:24.274
I just, I feel like there's...

57:24.275 --> 57:26.342
I feel like there's
someone else there,

57:26.343 --> 57:27.610
and then last night,

57:27.611 --> 57:29.512
I thought I heard something,

57:29.513 --> 57:31.279
like, a woman singing.

57:32.415 --> 57:36.019
- What? Like a ghost?
- I guess. I don't know.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.586
Then I saw something.

57:37.587 --> 57:39.388
I actually ran into someone.

57:39.389 --> 57:41.623
I mean, I saw...

57:43.326 --> 57:45.327
Was it the singing ghost?

57:46.196 --> 57:48.064
- It was a man.
- Oh!

57:48.065 --> 57:49.464
I think it was me.

57:50.533 --> 57:53.236
What? Your house
is haunted by yourself?

57:53.237 --> 57:55.104
Dun-dun!

57:55.105 --> 57:57.339
Yeah, well...

57:58.741 --> 58:01.811
I don't... I mean, I'm like...

58:01.812 --> 58:03.813
having a nervous
breakdown or something.

58:03.814 --> 58:05.614
I'm literally so
focused on this show

58:05.615 --> 58:07.984
that I feel like I'm
living inside of the show.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.119
I can't tell where
it ends and I begin,

58:10.120 --> 58:12.322
and I'm having
conversations with people,

58:12.323 --> 58:14.991
and I'm ten feet outside of
my body and looking down.

58:14.992 --> 58:17.593
There I am, having this
conversation with somebody,

58:17.594 --> 58:20.195
and I'm just observing it,
you know.

58:21.097 --> 58:23.465
Just, I don't feel good.

58:25.134 --> 58:28.136
You're just stressed, right?

58:29.805 --> 58:32.342
The network wants to replace you.

58:32.343 --> 58:33.942
Oh, my God.

58:38.447 --> 58:40.383
And I'm letting them,

58:40.384 --> 58:45.154
because I really want
this show on the air.

58:45.155 --> 58:47.390
I have all these
characters inside my head,

58:47.391 --> 58:49.725
and they wanna live,
and I'm the only way...

58:49.726 --> 58:53.462
This is the only way that they can.

58:53.463 --> 58:56.499
- I have five seasons mapped out.
- Oh, five?

58:56.500 --> 58:59.602
And, uh...
well, it sucks.

58:59.603 --> 59:01.604
Either you go away
or the show goes,

59:01.605 --> 59:03.739
and I had to make a decision,

59:03.740 --> 59:06.509
and that's the
decision that I made.

59:06.510 --> 59:09.811
And I am so sorry.

59:11.680 --> 59:13.549
I understand.

59:13.550 --> 59:17.553
I mean, it's
not <i>your</i> fault, right?

59:17.554 --> 59:20.223
I mean, it couldn't
be <i>your</i> fault.

59:20.224 --> 59:24.360
You are morally incapable
of doing the right thing.

59:24.361 --> 59:26.294
- I don't...
- Right? Don't do that.

59:27.230 --> 59:28.364
Don't get me wrong.

59:28.365 --> 59:30.133
I think you do feel bad for me.

59:30.134 --> 59:32.635
That's all I think you feel for me.

59:32.636 --> 59:34.404
Okay, I am still the fat girl

59:34.405 --> 59:35.972
you call on Friday nights

59:35.973 --> 59:37.506
when your date falls through.

59:37.507 --> 59:39.208
"Hey, let's go see a movie!"

59:39.209 --> 59:41.510
"Let's go to Fubar."

59:41.511 --> 59:44.147
"Then when I pick up a hot
piece of ass, I'll drop you,

59:44.148 --> 59:46.316
and that's okay...
don't worry about Melissa.

59:46.317 --> 59:48.985
I mean, you can call her
tomorrow and apologize, or not."

59:48.986 --> 59:52.455
It doesn't really matter 'cause we're
not actually friends, are we, Gavin?

59:52.456 --> 59:55.224
- That's just not true.
- Isn't it, really?

59:55.225 --> 59:57.760
I prefer to not do
this on camera, okay?

59:57.761 --> 59:59.895
- Is this not a good idea?
- Please lower your voice.

59:59.896 --> 01:00:02.098
I'm not gonna lower my voice.
Is that embarrassing?

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.599
You can't control this one.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.701
Your little puppets
are off their strings,

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.371
running around saying shit
that you didn't write.

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:11.140
Well, this is reality, and it
scares the shit out of you.

01:00:11.141 --> 01:00:12.908
Reality scares me?
Does it really?

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.110
I'm gonna tell you,

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.878
you wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for me.

01:00:15.879 --> 01:00:17.280
I gave you your first few roles

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:18.982
and your career as
a result of that.

01:00:18.983 --> 01:00:20.249
That's reality, Melissa.

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.819
Thank you for finally
playing that fucking card,

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.989
the "I invented
Melissa McCarthy" card.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:28.091
I bought a house, Gavin!

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:31.627
I bought a house 'cause
of what we talked about.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:34.430
Fuck you, and don't ever
fucking pity me again.

Upfronts is the week each year

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.028
when the networks present

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.163
their fall schedule
to the advertisers.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:09.198
It's a very important event for us,

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:11.668
and the weeks preceding it
are pretty stressful

01:01:11.669 --> 01:01:13.469
because the schedule is a secret

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:14.837
right up until it's announced.

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:17.106
"Upfronts" is a complete oxymoron

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.944
because nobody's
remotely honest, so it's...

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:23.279
It's really a show
for the advertisers

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.747
to get them really jazzed up

01:01:24.748 --> 01:01:27.149
about the new product for the fall.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:29.251
"Here's our new shit.
Like it?"

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:31.654
<i>There's lots of upsides...</i>
<i>you're in New York.</i>

01:01:31.655 --> 01:01:34.455
<i>Any time you're in New
York City is a good time.</i>

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:38.861
So, have you
heard from Susan?

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.164
No, I've not heard
from Susan as of yet.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:45.568
I left her four or five messages

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:48.104
telling her what
went down with Melissa,

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:49.405
and that I let her go,

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.741
and that I met
with Dahlia...

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:54.844
and I've not yet
heard back from her.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:56.779
<i>I feel bad about</i>
<i>what happened with Melissa,</i>

01:01:56.780 --> 01:01:59.248
<i>but it's a two-way street</i>
<i>and I'm a little angry, too.</i>

01:01:59.249 --> 01:02:01.417
<i>We've been friends</i>
<i>for years.</i>

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:04.085
<i>I think we'll be</i>
<i>friends again.</i>

01:02:05.554 --> 01:02:07.289
<i>We'll move on.</i>

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:10.259
Ice cold water, ice cold water.

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.361
Only one dollar.

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:16.231
I was 12 when we got in this car.

01:02:17.867 --> 01:02:20.503
<i>I've not yet heard</i>
<i>from Susan.</i>

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:23.038
<i>Got off the plane,</i>
<i>checked messages, nothing.</i>

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.742
I suppose that we have a...

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:31.347
I suppose we have
a reciprocal relationship,

01:02:31.348 --> 01:02:32.982
my show and your show.

01:02:32.983 --> 01:02:35.818
That's the thing about reality
television, isn't it...

01:02:35.819 --> 01:02:38.353
the worse it gets for me,
the better it is for you.

01:02:41.124 --> 01:02:43.559
It certainly inspires
a newfound sympathy

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:44.861
for my characters.

01:02:44.862 --> 01:02:46.694
You know, I put them through hell.

01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:51.500
I kill off their husbands
or throw them off cliffs.

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.268
I'm a cruel god...

01:02:54.704 --> 01:02:56.973
all in the name of a good story

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.506
or compelling television.

01:03:00.342 --> 01:03:02.611
What's funny is that
I'm a character in your show.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:04.313
I'm disposable.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:06.448
<i>Kill off the hero.</i>

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.116
<i>No one will see it coming.</i>

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:11.287
<i>I dare you.</i>

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:17.860
I think I'm just tired, you know?

01:03:17.861 --> 01:03:19.160
I'm just tired.

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:27.737
<i>It's just so surreal</i>
<i>being here.</i>

01:03:27.738 --> 01:03:31.039
It's not at all how I imagined.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.541
Oh.

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:36.879
Hey, you!

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.114
Hey, hi!

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.883
God, Gavin.

01:03:40.884 --> 01:03:42.184
Get in here, get in here!

01:03:42.185 --> 01:03:43.686
You're doing your show.

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:44.754
And so are you.

01:03:44.755 --> 01:03:46.422
Welcome to reality television.

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:47.623
Did you just get in?

01:03:47.624 --> 01:03:48.824
Just now.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:53.228
This whole last 24 hours
have been surreal.

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:55.396
Oh, right...
I just said that. Surreal.

01:03:56.565 --> 01:03:58.701
- You're good?
- Yeah, great.

01:03:58.702 --> 01:04:00.068
I wanted to call you, and...

01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:01.804
Oh, yeah?
No, call anytime.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:03.506
Seriously, I don't sleep, so...

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:07.743
I just felt really weird
about what happened.

01:04:07.744 --> 01:04:09.712
It's just too bad.

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:11.046
What happened?

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:14.283
<i>So I just bumped</i>
<i>into Dahlia Salem,</i>

01:04:14.284 --> 01:04:15.650
star of my show.

01:04:17.152 --> 01:04:19.087
Okay, no, she tells me

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:22.391
that Gatins' show got picked up,

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:24.427
so, no, she won't
be starring in my show,

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:26.761
which makes me wonder
if my show even exists.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.902
No, no, I left word for Roger,

01:04:32.903 --> 01:04:34.269
and I left word for Susan, too.

01:04:34.270 --> 01:04:36.704
It's like they dropped off
the face of the Earth.

01:04:38.006 --> 01:04:40.142
Just call me
when you know something.

01:04:48.684 --> 01:04:50.586
<i>At this moment,</i>
<i>I can't be certain</i>

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:53.155
<i>whether</i> Knowing <i>will end up</i>
<i>on the schedule at all.</i>

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:55.791
<i>As far as Gavin's concerned,</i>
<i>the show is on the air.</i>

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:57.626
You don't normally fly to New York

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:59.194
and find out at
the last fucking second

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:01.697
that your show's been pulled off the air.
Excuse me.

01:05:01.698 --> 01:05:03.966
So what is
the situation right now?

01:05:03.967 --> 01:05:07.670
I don't know. Right now, the
entire schedule is in flux,

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:08.938
and I get these missives

01:05:08.939 --> 01:05:10.873
from Roger and the "higher powers,"

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:13.776
but you're not really sure
what they add up to.

01:05:13.777 --> 01:05:14.844
What's up?

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:17.446
They flew you out here anyway, huh?

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:20.616
- I'll see you in...
- No, I mean...

01:05:20.617 --> 01:05:22.651
It would've been great
if you'd extended

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.186
the common courtesy of a call.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:25.888
This is the television business.

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:27.089
It's like high school.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.824
I don't know what to tell you, man.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:31.827
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

01:05:31.828 --> 01:05:34.029
But I'm kind of not.
I want my show on the air,

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:36.331
just like you want
your show on the air.

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.535
It was shitty of you to go behind
my back after Dahlia, okay?

01:05:39.536 --> 01:05:41.035
That was shitty.

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:46.375
And you fired Melissa
McCarthy without...

01:05:46.376 --> 01:05:48.143
you didn't even have a backup.

01:05:48.144 --> 01:05:50.345
Why would they pick up
your show without a star?

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:53.148
- The network wanted Dahlia.
- They wanted Dahlia in my show.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:56.051
We tested before your show.
We tested through the roof.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:58.786
You should see the numbers.
I'll show them to you.

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:03.959
- Really?
- Yeah. Who's your exec?

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:05.561
Susan Howard.

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:07.930
Susan Howard.
She was there.

01:06:07.931 --> 01:06:09.197
Ask her.

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:10.865
She would know.

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:22.578
Hey, I'm at the UTA party.

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:24.513
Did you hear about
Ricky's assistant?

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:26.015
She literally shat herself.

01:06:26.016 --> 01:06:28.383
- No, I saw it!
- Hey!

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:30.384
I'll break your fucking finger!

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.820
I'll call you back.

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.663
All right, let me explain
why I didn't call you back.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.731
Roger wanted to talk
to you personally.

01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.466
Bullshit. Bullshit.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:46.435
We're only picking up two dramas.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:49.972
- The rest is what, reality?
- You can go mid-season.

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:53.241
You can go to hell, okay?

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:54.610
All right.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:57.345
I've been the only one here
trying to protect you...

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:59.782
Oh, God, don't start!
Protecting me from what?

01:06:59.783 --> 01:07:02.517
From you? You're psychotic.
All I wanna know is why.

01:07:02.518 --> 01:07:03.886
- You want a motive?
- I do.

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:06.221
This isn't <i>Crim9 Lab.</i>
Nobody got murdered.

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.621
My show did. Tell me why.

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.827
I had to get you away from her.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:13.128
She was holding you back.

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.663
- You had to give her up.
- Melissa.

01:07:14.664 --> 01:07:16.431
G, if she really mattered so much,

01:07:16.432 --> 01:07:18.801
you couldn't have
betrayed her so easily.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:21.904
Do you manipulate
everybody or am I special?

01:07:21.905 --> 01:07:23.238
Are you the victim here?

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.941
The big creator can't stand
up to one little d-girl?

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:28.644
- It was your choice.
- Give me a break.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:29.845
I didn't have a choice.

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:31.947
It was either Dahlia or no show.

01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:34.016
That was the only thing...
oh, fuck you!

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:35.450
Fuck you!

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:37.886
Your dialogue used
to be a lot sharper.

01:07:37.887 --> 01:07:39.854
Maybe Gatins could
give it a polish.

01:07:48.697 --> 01:07:50.564
Is that all there is?

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:54.937
You feel like a man?

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:57.506
Because I'll tell you
a little secret.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:59.473
You're not.

01:08:15.824 --> 01:08:21.229
<i>♪ I'm here in silence ♪</i>

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:26.368
<i>♪ Walking</i>
<i>these trails alone ♪</i>

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:32.206

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:39.281
<i>♪ Tears coming home</i>

01:08:39.282 --> 01:08:42.350
<i>♪ Two other lovers...</i>

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:43.417
Hey, look, my...

01:08:43.419 --> 01:08:44.953
I don't wanna do this anymore.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:46.388
My show is not gonna happen,

01:08:46.389 --> 01:08:48.057
so this show's over, done, gone,

01:08:48.058 --> 01:08:49.491
good-bye, thank you very much.

01:08:49.492 --> 01:08:51.825
I'm not gonna be
your fuckin' puppet!

01:08:53.028 --> 01:08:55.330
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

01:08:55.331 --> 01:08:57.733
Who you talkin' to?

01:09:19.854 --> 01:09:21.688
Oh, God.

01:09:45.046 --> 01:09:47.899
I can understand
why you're a little confused.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:49.316
No, no.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.587
I'm a lot confused.

01:09:55.174 --> 01:09:56.574
Theories?

01:09:57.576 --> 01:09:58.944
This is all a dream?

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:00.845
No.

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.650
I'm in a coma?

01:10:04.651 --> 01:10:06.150
No.

01:10:08.787 --> 01:10:10.456
Then I'm dead?

01:10:10.457 --> 01:10:12.090
This is hell

01:10:12.091 --> 01:10:15.294
or a purgatorium or something?

01:10:15.295 --> 01:10:16.695
Okay, purgatorium

01:10:16.696 --> 01:10:18.497
is where Romans vomited,

01:10:18.498 --> 01:10:21.933
but no, this is as real

01:10:21.934 --> 01:10:23.101
as anything can be.

01:10:23.102 --> 01:10:25.003
What does that mean?

01:10:25.004 --> 01:10:27.206
Everything is what it is,

01:10:27.207 --> 01:10:30.808
but you're not who
you think you are.

01:10:32.911 --> 01:10:35.780
Okay. Then who am I?

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.083
You are...

01:10:40.952 --> 01:10:43.622
a multi-dimensional being

01:10:43.623 --> 01:10:47.226
of vast, almost infinite power.

01:10:47.227 --> 01:10:50.663
You, this body you're in,

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:53.832
it's just one of your incarnations,

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:56.333
avatars, call you what you will.

01:10:57.236 --> 01:10:59.705
Are you saying I'm God?

01:10:59.706 --> 01:11:01.840
Technically, no.

01:11:01.841 --> 01:11:04.276
If God is a ten,

01:11:04.277 --> 01:11:06.645
a theoretical ultimate,

01:11:06.646 --> 01:11:09.313
you're more of a nine.

01:11:11.183 --> 01:11:12.316
What are you?

01:11:13.219 --> 01:11:14.753
Humans are sevens.

01:11:14.754 --> 01:11:16.320
Monkeys are sixes.

01:11:17.656 --> 01:11:19.391
What are the eights?

01:11:19.392 --> 01:11:20.826
Koalas.

01:11:20.827 --> 01:11:22.027
They're telepathic,

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:24.330
plus they control the weather.

01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:28.900
But, uh, the
important thing is you.

01:11:28.901 --> 01:11:31.570
You created this world on a whim

01:11:31.571 --> 01:11:33.472
and decided to stick around

01:11:33.473 --> 01:11:35.974
to see how it turned out.

01:11:35.975 --> 01:11:38.844
You can destroy the world
with a single thought.

01:11:38.845 --> 01:11:41.780
Don't, incidentally.

01:11:41.781 --> 01:11:44.383
Just file that away.

01:11:44.384 --> 01:11:47.553
But... the truth is,

01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:49.755
you hold all the cards.

01:11:49.756 --> 01:11:52.391
When people pray,

01:11:52.392 --> 01:11:53.892
they don't want this thing

01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:55.227
or that thing.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.295
They just...

01:11:56.296 --> 01:11:58.463
They don't want to be forgotten.

01:12:01.933 --> 01:12:05.904
So... you understand?

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.874
I mean, I would've
told you earlier,

01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:09.975
but I didn't...

01:12:09.976 --> 01:12:11.243
Yeah.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:13.145
Okay?

01:12:13.146 --> 01:12:14.779
I understand.

01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:20.384
But I don't believe you.

01:12:46.011 --> 01:12:49.013
Noelle, don't get too far ahead.

01:12:52.151 --> 01:12:55.019
No! You had ice cream at lunch.

01:12:56.588 --> 01:12:59.224
Evidently, frozen yogurt
doesn't count.

01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:00.759
I'll make note.

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.528
Oh! That's blazing speed
right there!

01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:09.702
Did you hit it?

01:13:09.703 --> 01:13:11.468
Shouldn't have to.

01:13:20.679 --> 01:13:23.247
Honey, I think we left
the overhead light on.

01:13:24.683 --> 01:13:27.786
Battery's dead.
At least the starter is.

01:13:27.787 --> 01:13:30.689
- How do we, uh...?
- We call the service.

01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:32.157
There's not much else we can do.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:35.160
Just the little battery, right?
The big one's probably fine.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.795
I guess.

01:13:36.796 --> 01:13:39.231
We can't jump it from
one battery to another?

01:13:39.232 --> 01:13:40.899
You cross over somehow?

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.035
Who do you think
you married, MacGyver?

01:13:43.036 --> 01:13:45.836
Come on. Hold on.

01:13:51.009 --> 01:13:52.677
- Are you getting a signal?
- No.

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:53.844
You?

01:13:54.747 --> 01:13:56.414
Yes. One bar.

01:13:56.415 --> 01:13:58.950
Yeah?
Here, hold that.

01:14:02.755 --> 01:14:04.990
Don't worry.

01:14:04.991 --> 01:14:06.792
Daddy's calling people to help us.

01:14:06.793 --> 01:14:09.094
Minute you place a call,
the bar goes away.

01:14:09.095 --> 01:14:10.528
Keep trying.

01:14:10.529 --> 01:14:12.131
I'll keep trying, Mary,

01:14:12.132 --> 01:14:13.832
but it's gonna keep happening.

01:14:13.833 --> 01:14:15.699
What do you wanna do?

01:14:17.002 --> 01:14:18.169
I don't know.

01:14:20.139 --> 01:14:22.139
Maybe if you hold it up higher.

01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.217
Okay, look, the problem
is that we're boxed in.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:33.385
It's a canyon.

01:14:33.386 --> 01:14:34.887
Where we came off the main road,

01:14:34.888 --> 01:14:36.520
it was more open and higher, too.

01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.558
- That's at least a mile.
- I can run that.

01:14:42.694 --> 01:14:44.195
So, what, we stay here?

01:14:47.232 --> 01:14:48.700
You okay with that?

01:14:48.701 --> 01:14:51.703
I don't think we have
much of a choice, so...

01:14:51.704 --> 01:14:54.705
- Yeah. Go.
- Okay.

01:14:56.108 --> 01:14:58.376
Daddy's gonna get
a truck to help us out.

01:14:58.377 --> 01:15:00.946
Take care of Mommy, okay?
All right.

01:15:00.947 --> 01:15:02.380
Be right back.

01:16:09.214 --> 01:16:12.217
Excuse me.

01:16:12.218 --> 01:16:16.188
Hey, hi. Do you have a cell phone?

01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:17.256
Oh, no, I don't.

01:16:17.257 --> 01:16:18.656
There's no service up here.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:20.625
Yeah, I'm finding that out.

01:16:20.626 --> 01:16:22.861
You can usually get a signal down

01:16:22.862 --> 01:16:24.829
at the ranger's station.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:25.898
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:16:25.899 --> 01:16:28.166
You just follow the road down.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.435
It's probably... I don't know.
You got a car?

01:16:30.436 --> 01:16:33.704
No, it's dead.
That's why I need a...

01:16:34.572 --> 01:16:36.441
Are you headed back
to your car now?

01:16:36.442 --> 01:16:39.977
If you could give me a ride
to a gas station, wherever?

01:16:40.845 --> 01:16:43.315
Oh, uh...

01:16:43.316 --> 01:16:46.351
Look, I'm not some
crazy Ted Bundy guy.

01:16:46.352 --> 01:16:48.652
I'm not gonna rape
or kill you or anything.

01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:53.056
Which is, of course,
what a Ted Bundy would say.

01:16:54.426 --> 01:16:57.229
Look, I'm a videogame designer.

01:16:57.230 --> 01:17:00.432
My wife is an editor,
my daughter's eight.

01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:02.867
Look, I just... they're
waiting back at the car.

01:17:02.868 --> 01:17:04.536
Just a little help
before it gets dark.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.571
I'll call somebody
when I get back to town.

01:17:06.572 --> 01:17:08.373
I believe you, I do,
it's just you don't know

01:17:08.374 --> 01:17:10.409
where the car is,
and the guy might not come.

01:17:10.410 --> 01:17:13.245
- We can't be up here all night, so...
- Sorry.

01:17:13.246 --> 01:17:15.347
Don't be sorry, just help me out.

01:17:15.348 --> 01:17:17.648
No. I can't.

01:17:22.654 --> 01:17:24.588
Why won't you trust me?

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.650
Okay, but you have
to be careful.

01:17:52.651 --> 01:17:55.219
Understand? You have
to use big girl hands.

01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:58.290
You want to see
where we were today?

01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:01.926
Okay, hit play.
This button.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:04.396
Oh...

01:18:04.397 --> 01:18:07.499
There's you and there's Daddy.

01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.733
Oh, a little movie star, huh?

01:18:14.839 --> 01:18:17.441
He'll be back soon.
Don't you worry.

01:18:27.552 --> 01:18:28.919
Hey.

01:18:30.255 --> 01:18:31.689
Are you following me?

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:35.093
Once I was sure
you weren't following me.

01:18:35.094 --> 01:18:37.496
I'm sorry, it's just...

01:18:37.497 --> 01:18:39.931
- You thought I was Ted Bundy.
- Kind of.

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:41.099
Yeah.

01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:44.369
My name's Gabriel... Bundy.

01:18:44.370 --> 01:18:46.203
Sierra.

01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:49.541
It's weird that
there's no cars at all.

01:18:49.542 --> 01:18:51.809
Yeah, I'll say.

01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:54.146
Anyway, my car is parked over there.

01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:56.848
It's not that far,

01:18:56.849 --> 01:18:59.217
and if you want, I could
give you a ride to town.

01:18:59.218 --> 01:19:01.453
That'd be great. Thank you.

01:19:01.454 --> 01:19:04.054
- Make up some karma.
- Please, lead the way.

01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.728
Just a sec.

01:19:15.367 --> 01:19:17.436
Okay, confession.

01:19:17.437 --> 01:19:21.440
- I kind of recognized you.
- Really.

01:19:21.441 --> 01:19:23.908
I wasn't sure, but I think
I saw a picture of you

01:19:23.909 --> 01:19:26.378
in my boyfriend's
videogame magazine.

01:19:26.379 --> 01:19:28.012
Right? You're, like, the shit.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:29.114
No, no.

01:19:29.115 --> 01:19:30.648
You're like the Quentin Tarantino

01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:33.351
of their world, videogame god.

01:19:33.352 --> 01:19:34.352
Not really, no.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.753
Fine.

01:19:35.754 --> 01:19:38.390
You seriously recognized
me off one photo?

01:19:38.391 --> 01:19:40.892
I thought you were kind
of hot, considering.

01:19:40.893 --> 01:19:41.993
Considering...?

01:19:41.994 --> 01:19:44.062
Within the subset
of videogame people.

01:19:44.063 --> 01:19:45.830
Ah, okay.

01:19:45.831 --> 01:19:48.200
I wasn't masturbating
to your picture or anything.

01:19:48.201 --> 01:19:49.334
I guess I'm flattered.

01:19:49.335 --> 01:19:50.702
You should be.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:52.237
I'm stingy with compliments.

01:19:52.238 --> 01:19:54.606
Your boyfriend plays videogames?

01:19:54.607 --> 01:19:58.110
Ex-boyfriend.
And yes, way too many.

01:19:58.111 --> 01:19:59.911
He used to play <i>Evercrack</i>

01:19:59.912 --> 01:20:01.313
- back in the day...
- Oh, no.

01:20:01.314 --> 01:20:03.081
but your game was, like, well,

01:20:03.082 --> 01:20:05.117
I don't know,
what's worse than crack?

01:20:05.118 --> 01:20:06.284
Supercrack?

01:20:06.285 --> 01:20:07.719
He was spending 40 hours a week

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.887
collecting Thunderleaf or whatever,

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:12.324
and I was his mule,
hauling it around,

01:20:12.325 --> 01:20:13.558
'cause he ran out of space.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:14.826
You had an account?

01:20:14.827 --> 01:20:16.861
Part of your world,
and you didn't know it.

01:20:16.862 --> 01:20:18.563
I'm sorry.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:20.698
You can make it up to me.

01:20:22.134 --> 01:20:23.235
Shit.

01:20:27.940 --> 01:20:30.106
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:38.883
<i>And I am so sorry.</i>

01:20:38.884 --> 01:20:43.854
<i>I understand.</i>
<i>It's not</i> your <i>fault, right?</i>

01:20:44.889 --> 01:20:46.957
<i>It couldn't be</i> your <i>fault.</i>

01:20:47.925 --> 01:20:49.761
<i>You're morally incapable</i>

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:51.429
<i>of doing the right thing.</i>

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:52.663
<i>- I don't...</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

01:20:53.665 --> 01:20:55.800
So, you play a lot
of characters at once?

01:20:55.801 --> 01:20:58.670
A couple.
Most people do.

01:20:58.671 --> 01:21:00.438
But you're not most people.

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:02.174
You created the world.

01:21:02.175 --> 01:21:03.841
You know all the secret codes.

01:21:03.842 --> 01:21:06.611
- What, like god mode?
- Is that what you call it?

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.246
It's when you have all the powers

01:21:08.247 --> 01:21:09.614
and you can't be killed.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:11.383
It's actually boring
to play, though.

01:21:11.384 --> 01:21:13.185
A game isn't fun
unless there are rules.

01:21:13.186 --> 01:21:15.018
And you make the rules.

01:21:16.588 --> 01:21:18.890
Yeah, I do.

01:21:18.891 --> 01:21:20.491
Thanks.

01:21:23.061 --> 01:21:24.928
Do you think that I'm pretty?

01:21:26.498 --> 01:21:27.566
What?

01:21:27.567 --> 01:21:29.334
Do you think I'm hot...

01:21:29.335 --> 01:21:32.669
on a purely physical level?

01:21:34.506 --> 01:21:35.639
Sure.

01:21:36.508 --> 01:21:38.009
That's a rave.

01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:40.212
Well, I don't know
why you're asking.

01:21:40.213 --> 01:21:42.947
My ex-boyfriend the orc
used to say,

01:21:42.948 --> 01:21:45.317
"The thing that I like about you

01:21:45.318 --> 01:21:48.320
is you're not so hot I'm
afraid I'm gonna lose you."

01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:50.455
So where's the orc now?

01:21:50.456 --> 01:21:51.822
He's dead.

01:21:53.024 --> 01:21:54.359
I spiked his water bottle

01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:56.294
with a massive quantity of GHB.

01:21:56.295 --> 01:21:58.330
He hallucinated,

01:21:58.331 --> 01:22:00.397
went into convulsions, and died.

01:22:02.334 --> 01:22:04.635
Remind me not
to piss you off, Sarah.

01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.670
Sierra!

01:22:07.672 --> 01:22:09.039
Sorry.

01:22:11.476 --> 01:22:12.544
What makes you think

01:22:12.545 --> 01:22:14.478
you haven't pissed me off already?

01:22:19.551 --> 01:22:21.184
How you doin', kiddo?

01:22:22.703 --> 01:22:24.572
I was thinking we could all go

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:27.142
to El Cholo for dinner tonight.

01:22:27.143 --> 01:22:29.744
How do you feel about
some blue corn enchiladas?

01:22:29.745 --> 01:22:31.945
Should we ask Daddy
when he gets back?

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:35.683
He's not coming back.

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.687
<i>How could you?</i>

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:42.056
<i>How could you?!</i>

01:22:42.057 --> 01:22:43.258
<i>How could you.</i>

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:44.491
<i>How could you.</i>

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.862
<i>How could you...?</i>

01:22:47.863 --> 01:22:49.764
<i>- How could you?</i>
<i>- Cut. Perfect.</i>

01:22:49.765 --> 01:22:51.533
<i>I feel so dirty.</i>

01:22:51.534 --> 01:22:52.799
<i>That's how I like it.</i>

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:12.786
Wait.

01:23:14.355 --> 01:23:16.157
Something's wrong.

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:17.591
I feel...

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.000
Ugh.

01:23:36.377 --> 01:23:39.379
Mm, uh, wait.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.617
I have a wife and a daughter.

01:23:42.618 --> 01:23:44.051
They're waiting for me.

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:45.587
- Where are they?
- Back at the car.

01:23:45.588 --> 01:23:46.720
Which direction?

01:23:51.492 --> 01:23:53.361
Whoa.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.330
Face it, G, you don't
know where they are.

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:56.631
You don't know where you are.

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:58.633
We've been walking
in circles for an hour.

01:23:58.634 --> 01:24:02.036
- Where is your car?
- There is no car.

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.538
It was all a pretense,

01:24:03.539 --> 01:24:06.541
an excuse to get you on your own.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.076
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:10.844
You getting dizzy?

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:13.547
It's just the GHB in the water.

01:24:15.182 --> 01:24:16.984
What's happening?

01:24:16.985 --> 01:24:19.086
I'm sorry that it had
to come to this, G.

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:21.087
I promise it's gonna be over soon.

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:23.891
You're trying to kill me?

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:27.528
No, this is not a murder.
It's an intervention.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:30.197
Do you feel like a man?
You're not.

01:24:30.198 --> 01:24:33.100
I had to get you away from her.
She was holding you back.

01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:34.669
- You had to give her up.
- Melissa.

01:24:34.670 --> 01:24:37.538
- Allee... allee... all come free!
- There's something wrong...

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.807
I can get you out of here,

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.643
but you have to trust me.

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:43.544
Do you feel like a man?

01:24:43.545 --> 01:24:46.180
'Cause I'll tell you
a little secret.

01:24:46.181 --> 01:24:48.147
You're not.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.332
Why are you doing this?

01:25:07.201 --> 01:25:08.935
You did this to yourself.

01:25:09.937 --> 01:25:12.506
And admitting that
is the first step.

01:25:14.141 --> 01:25:17.410
You're a crackhead, G.

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:23.451
Thing is, this planet
and these people,

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.619
they're your drug of choice.

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:30.525
It wasn't that hard
to make a universe.

01:25:30.526 --> 01:25:33.861
At first you just checked in
every once in a while...

01:25:33.862 --> 01:25:36.197
see how the
Neanderthals were doing,

01:25:36.198 --> 01:25:39.166
move a couple
of continents around.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:41.769
But then you got more into it.

01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:44.905
You started playing a couple
of characters of your own.

01:25:45.873 --> 01:25:48.676
Slaves, kings, messiahs.

01:25:48.677 --> 01:25:50.978
Pretty soon you were playing 24/7.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.380
How long have I been...

01:25:52.381 --> 01:25:55.616
You've been gone for 4,000 years,

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:58.284
not that time means
the same for us.

01:25:59.153 --> 01:26:01.055
You came looking for me?

01:26:01.056 --> 01:26:03.691
That's what a girl does.

01:26:03.692 --> 01:26:05.426
Why now?

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:08.195
Because you forgot who you were.

01:26:08.196 --> 01:26:10.264
You forgot this wasn't real.

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:13.401
We couldn't just storm in
on a fiery chariot.

01:26:13.402 --> 01:26:16.471
It was your universe.
We had to play by your rules.

01:26:16.472 --> 01:26:18.706
We had to show you
how limited and corrupt

01:26:18.707 --> 01:26:20.375
your little world was.

01:26:20.376 --> 01:26:21.442
Don't get me wrong.

01:26:21.443 --> 01:26:24.544
It's... it's a nice place.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.048
It's cozy...

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:30.784
but do you remember
where you came from?

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:41.294
Do you remember
where you came from?

01:26:42.162 --> 01:26:43.730
It was warm.

01:26:46.267 --> 01:26:49.704
And white, like a...

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:52.373
You can't describe it
with human words.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:54.942
You can't think it
with human thoughts.

01:26:54.943 --> 01:26:57.010
We need you to come back.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.779
With us.

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.849
Come back with me.

01:27:11.592 --> 01:27:15.563
<i>You can destroy the world</i>
<i>with a single thought.</i>

01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:19.867
<i>Don't, incidentally.</i>
<i>Just file that away.</i>

01:27:19.868 --> 01:27:23.103
<i>The truth is</i>
<i>you hold all the cards.</i>

01:27:23.104 --> 01:27:24.739
<i>When people pray,</i>

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:28.342
<i>they don't want this thing</i>
<i>or that thing.</i>

01:27:28.343 --> 01:27:31.178
<i>They just... they don't</i>
<i>want to be forgotten.</i>

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:33.113
<i>You understand?</i>

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:34.315
Noelle?

01:27:34.316 --> 01:27:36.451
<i>I would have</i>
<i>told you earlier, but...</i>

01:27:36.452 --> 01:27:37.751
Noelle?!

01:27:40.287 --> 01:27:41.856
Noelle!

01:27:41.857 --> 01:27:43.623
Noelle!

01:27:44.826 --> 01:27:46.894
Noelle!

01:27:46.895 --> 01:27:50.431
Maybe if I just cut back,
didn't get so involved.

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.232
We both know that'll never work.

01:27:52.233 --> 01:27:53.701
Next week you'll be back here

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:55.169
redesigning the pinecones.

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:58.105
You have to quit, cold turkey.

01:27:58.106 --> 01:27:59.306
I can't.

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:02.610
You can, but I can't
force you to leave.

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:03.977
You have to want it.

01:28:20.995 --> 01:28:22.829
Noelle!

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:28.168
Come on! Answer Mama!

01:28:29.403 --> 01:28:31.171
Answer me!

01:28:31.172 --> 01:28:32.972
Noelle!

01:28:34.274 --> 01:28:35.641
- Noelle!
- She's here.

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:39.179
I didn't forget about you guys.

01:28:42.049 --> 01:28:43.850
Everything okay?

01:28:44.919 --> 01:28:48.122
Yeah, everything's fine.
Absolutely.

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:49.789

<i>♪ I can always be found</i>

01:31:03.457 --> 01:31:05.758
You need to go, don't you?

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.461
No.

01:31:09.363 --> 01:31:10.798
I can stay.

01:31:10.799 --> 01:31:13.067
How long, forever?

01:31:13.068 --> 01:31:14.368
Every day you'd be here,

01:31:14.369 --> 01:31:16.435
you'd know what you were missing.

01:31:18.205 --> 01:31:20.541
What happens if you go?

01:31:20.542 --> 01:31:23.209
Worst case scenario?

01:31:27.214 --> 01:31:28.816
Disintegration of everything

01:31:28.817 --> 01:31:31.686
into a fiery void,
<i>oblivio accebit.</i>

01:31:31.687 --> 01:31:33.554
The end of everything.

01:31:33.555 --> 01:31:35.690
That's all?

01:31:35.691 --> 01:31:37.757
Probably wouldn't happen.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:41.796
I guess I'm more worried
about the human factor.

01:31:41.797 --> 01:31:44.464
You guys kill each other a lot.

01:31:44.465 --> 01:31:46.701
In fairness,
it's usually in your name.

01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:50.270
Plus, we've gotten
much more efficient at it.

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:52.338
I like this world.

01:31:54.308 --> 01:31:57.878
I like my life here
with you and Noelle.

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.178
It's not real.

01:32:00.681 --> 01:32:02.282
I'm not really your wife.

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:04.617
You're not really my husband.

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.388
On some level, it's all pretend.

01:32:11.458 --> 01:32:13.559
How many versions were there?

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:17.964
Ninety.
This is the last one.

01:32:19.533 --> 01:32:20.935
Wow.

01:32:20.936 --> 01:32:22.669
I've destroyed

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:25.239
billions of people
with a thought...

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:27.041
...and you'd like to think

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:28.075
that it's painless.

01:32:28.076 --> 01:32:29.608
Stop.

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:35.348
You don't have
to explain or apologize.

01:32:36.416 --> 01:32:40.553
Everything that is
is because of you.

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:48.828
And if that's all there is,
that's enough.

01:32:57.504 --> 01:32:58.973
So.

01:32:58.974 --> 01:33:00.573
So.

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:04.543
Guess you don't really
need to pack anything.

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:08.382
I'm good.

01:33:08.383 --> 01:33:09.682
You're great.

01:33:11.051 --> 01:33:14.054
It has been a pleasure.

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:15.554
Likewise.

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.559
I love you.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:23.562
I love you, too, you big lug.

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:32.938
You're my favorite.

01:34:31.765 --> 01:34:33.968
...should we measure it first?

01:34:33.969 --> 01:34:36.036
Got flour, we have flour.

01:34:36.037 --> 01:34:37.671
All right, so I need oil.

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:38.973
We need nutmeg.

01:34:38.974 --> 01:34:40.940
Oh, honey, do we have nutmeg?

01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.544
We should.

01:34:45.779 --> 01:34:47.514
Good. Good, good, good, good, good.

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:49.583
- Nutmeg.
- Oh, cinnamon, too.

01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:52.887
If I had a horse,
I would name her Cinnamon.

01:34:52.888 --> 01:34:55.155
- And if I had another horse...
- Nutmeg?

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:56.556
No, Flash.

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:58.625
What? Why Flash?

01:34:58.626 --> 01:35:00.394
I mean, I would name her Flash

01:35:00.395 --> 01:35:03.063
because she'd be the fastest
horse in the world.

01:35:03.064 --> 01:35:04.431
I mean in the whole world.

01:35:04.432 --> 01:35:06.700
- In the whole world?
- Ever whole.

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:09.370
The ever whole world?
That's pretty good.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:10.537
That's pretty fast.

01:35:10.538 --> 01:35:13.573
Yes, and I would be a princess.

01:35:13.574 --> 01:35:15.074
Sweetie?

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:20.847
This might sound really strange,

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:22.482
but what's my name?

01:35:23.850 --> 01:35:25.084
Um.

01:35:26.887 --> 01:35:28.053
Mommy.

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:31.392
Right. Exactly.

01:35:31.393 --> 01:35:34.193
He's not coming back.

01:35:35.595 --> 01:35:37.464
But it's gonna be okay.

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:40.401
He put all the pieces together.

01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:43.637
- It's like...
- The best of all possible worlds.

01:35:45.373 --> 01:35:48.474
Honey, is it supposed
to stick like this?

01:35:49.676 --> 01:35:52.980
- Better help him.
- Let's go.

01:35:52.981 --> 01:35:55.482
- Do you see what I'm talking about?
- Oh, my gosh.

01:35:55.483 --> 01:35:58.252
consistency. Is it maybe
a little... it's too thick.

01:35:58.253 --> 01:35:59.920
We can safely say that's too thick?

01:35:59.921 --> 01:36:01.989
Will you get some milk?

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:05.459
- Get milk?
- See, it says milk on the recipe.

01:36:05.460 --> 01:36:06.592
Ready?

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:09.463
Oh, my. Oh, no!
All right.

01:36:09.464 --> 01:36:11.930
Oh, don't mess it up.
Don't mess it up.

01:36:13.233 --> 01:36:14.534
Thank you.

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.971
Shouldn't we be using a machine?

01:36:16.972 --> 01:36:19.573
- Isn't there a machine we can...
- I'm the machine!

01:36:19.574 --> 01:36:21.942
You're our machine?
Ooh!

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.643
- All right.
- Come on, machine.

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:25.712
