Where's Kevin?

09:48.656 --> 09:51.024
I do not know.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.694
Uh, I think you do know
because I see some sweat

09:53.761 --> 09:55.796
forming on the dome there.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.498
Puzzles make me nervous.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.700
This one is very challenging.

I'm doing it in pen.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.838
Listen,
if you wanna work here,

10:04.905 --> 10:07.107
you're gonna have to tell me
where Kevin is.

told him not to do that.

Monosyllabic,
hunched shoulders.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.051
Let me guess.
Bad grade on a test,

11:24.117 --> 11:27.087
or did a pretty girl
reject your overtures?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.521
No. Worse.

11:28.588 --> 11:30.290
I told the peanut allergy kids
I didn't have any allergies.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.660
Ah, yes. Kendra told me
about your little ruse.

11:33.727 --> 11:34.862
I gather it didn't go well.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.229
They snapped my EpiPen
in half

11:36.296 --> 11:39.332
and wrote "Peanut eater"
on my locker.

I can help you out.

the cool, confident man
you see before you.

12:00.220 --> 12:04.591
No, when I was your age,
I was overweight, I had acne,

12:04.657 --> 12:07.027
and I used a cane.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.628
Wait,
what was the cane for?

you're doing and...

you're doing it with.
