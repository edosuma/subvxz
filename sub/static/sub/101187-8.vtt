WEBVTT

00:00.083 --> 00:01.293
Oh!

00:01.376 --> 00:03.170
Yeah.
- Ah.

00:04.671 --> 00:06.340
- Shit!

00:06.423 --> 00:07.466
- Holy shit.

00:08.634 --> 00:09.676
Maybe there was a bullet in there.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.929
- You're a bad man!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.931
Kev, chill out.
- Who's the lunatic now?
- Motherfucker!

00:14.014 --> 00:16.517
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.227
- Josh, stop. This is bullshit!
- No, buddy.

00:18.310 --> 00:20.354
- You're trying to fucking kill me!
- What's your problem?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.481
I already apologized to you.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.942
- When? When did you apologize?
- I thought I did.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.360
- Well...
- You thought you apologized?

00:26.443 --> 00:29.446
- You know what?
Maybe I would apologize to you

00:29.530 --> 00:31.448
if you gave me back my necklace!

00:31.532 --> 00:34.451
- There it is. There it is.
You knew I took the necklace,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.828
so you tried to fucking kill me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

00:36.912 --> 00:39.331
- Just admit it, man!
- Hey, Kev. Kev, Kev, Kev, Kev.
Just chill out.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.958
We're all just goofing around.
We're just having a little fun.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.335
Okay? Nobody got hurt. Nobody got hurt.
- Oh... Oh, it was a goof.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.170
- Yeah, it's a goof.
- Well, now that I know that,

00:45.254 --> 00:46.672
I guess I feel better.
- All right.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.715
- Did you know it was a goof, Jordan?

00:48.799 --> 00:50.092
- You know what? I don't know, okay?

00:50.175 --> 00:51.510
It was... I-I don't know.
- You don't know?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.595
- I'm staying out of it. Yeah.
- Now you're staying out of it.

00:53.679 --> 00:54.805
- You know what? Okay.
Everybody's tempers are

00:54.888 --> 00:56.306
a little hot right now.
Maybe we could all just

00:56.390 --> 00:57.891
take a break, maybe take five.
- Let's take a break.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.893
- We drink some water,
we have some beef jerky, we just...

00:59.977 --> 01:02.437
We reconvene in a bit, okay? You cool?
- I'm cool. I'm cool.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.022
I'm cool. Give... Come on.
- Give him a hug, man.

01:04.106 --> 01:05.691
- Give me a hug. Give me a hug.
- I don't... I don't... No.

01:05.774 --> 01:06.859
Come on.
- I love you, man.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.026
- That's beautiful, right?
- I love you.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.404
- How do you love me? How?
- How?

01:10.487 --> 01:11.697
How does anybody love anybody?

01:13.323 --> 01:14.491
- What?

01:14.575 --> 01:18.078
- That's profound.
- It's a good question.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.041
- We're gonna miss you, big guy.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.751
- I'll miss you, too, baby.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.171
- Now he's letting us see daytime
as if we're free.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.508
- I never said you weren't
allowed to leave.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.677
You got a little bit
of imagination there, buddy.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.804
- Well, I remember my car used to be here,

01:35.888 --> 01:38.807
but now my car is
at the bottom of a ravine.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.267
Guess I'm imagining that, too?

01:40.350 --> 01:42.686
- Yeah, well, you know,
this is meth country.

01:42.769 --> 01:45.439
Probably a couple of tweakers
going for a joyride.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.232
- Ah, that's right. I forgot.
- They'll be back.

01:47.316 --> 01:48.901
Tweakers love to drive. I keep forgetting.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.569
- I thought we were gonna be cool, baby.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.154
- Yeah. What about that?
- I am cool.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.697
- Hey, look.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.532
I know this has been tough on you.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.492
You only got a couple days left.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.454
My advice, take as much wisdom
as you can from this guy.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.997
- Mm. Yeah.
- And just have some fun.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.249
- Thank you. Appreciate you, Josh.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.667
- See you, Kev.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.128
I love you, man.
- I love you, too, man.

02:08.212 --> 02:10.339
Jordan.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.674
- Hey.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.511
- What the fuck was that?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.895
- Agent Hart.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.688
I want to tell you something.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.982
- I don't really feel
like dealing with it, Coach Ron.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.986
- Look, look, I'm sorry
about the live bullet, man.

02:33.070 --> 02:34.238
I really am.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.699
- That's all I wanted, man.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.660
All I wanted was an apology.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.662
- I know.
- You saying that to me

02:41.745 --> 02:44.414
makes the world of difference.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.917
I'm sorry that I accused you of...

02:47.000 --> 02:49.628
of trying to kill me and other people.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.215
Now, give me a hug, man.
Thank you.

02:53.298 --> 02:55.175
Thank you.
- Uh, guys?

02:55.259 --> 02:58.011
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

03:13.443 --> 03:15.070
- Holy shit.
- Oh, shit!

03:19.324 --> 03:21.869
- Oh, shit!

03:21.952 --> 03:24.079
- Get inside! Come on!
- What the fuck was that?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.873
- Now! Goddamn it!
- Oh, shit!

03:25.956 --> 03:27.332
Oh, shit!

03:27.416 --> 03:29.334
It's a bomb!

03:31.253 --> 03:33.755
What the hell is happening?

03:33.839 --> 03:34.882
- Hey, Ron, I-I don't know this scene.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.134
Where is it in the script?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.886
- It is not in the fucking script!

03:38.969 --> 03:40.596
- No, no, no. Tell me you're kidding.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.972
Tell me that was just a stunt!

03:42.055 --> 03:44.183
That we did not just watch
Josh Hartnett explode!

03:44.266 --> 03:46.768
- It is not a stunt!
It is not in the script.

03:46.852 --> 03:48.729
Josh Hartnett is dead!

03:48.812 --> 03:51.106
Oh, God, I fucked up!

03:51.190 --> 03:52.733
I fucked up!

03:52.816 --> 03:54.109
- What the fuck is going on?
- Shit. Okay.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.694
- What the fuck is going on?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.696
- Okay, Kevin, don't-don't be mad.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.157
Don't be mad, but this whole thing,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.159
aside from what just happened
to Josh Hartnett,

04:02.242 --> 04:03.702
has-has been scripted.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.120
- What the fuck is that accent?

04:05.204 --> 04:06.788
- I was acting! I'm sorry!

04:06.872 --> 04:09.208
I'm not from Chicago! I'm from Essex!

04:09.291 --> 04:11.502
Claude Van De Velde wanted you
at your most authentic,

04:11.585 --> 04:14.129
so he-he hid a bunch of cameras in here

04:14.213 --> 04:16.673
to film us playing roles,
doing the stunts, all of it.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.717
But whatever just happened
wasn't part of it,

04:18.800 --> 04:20.427
which is fucking insane, Ron!

04:20.511 --> 04:22.888
For fuck's sake!
- For fuck's sake?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.598
That's what you want to say to me?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.058
For fuck's sake?!

04:34.066 --> 04:37.236
- Talk in your regular voice.
- All right, that...

04:37.319 --> 04:39.196
No, I've lost it now. I'm in my head!

04:39.279 --> 04:41.907
- Who does that?!
Who does this to somebody?

04:43.992 --> 04:45.410
Shit!

04:45.494 --> 04:46.662
Fuck!

04:54.127 --> 04:56.755
Oh, shit. You okay?

04:56.839 --> 05:00.175
- Oh, God, I'm such a fucking idiot.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.636
What was I thinking?
- What the hell was that, man?

05:02.719 --> 05:04.221
- You want to know
what the hell is going on?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.806
- You're goddamn right
I want to know what's going on.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.224
- I bought some drugs.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.643
I sold them to the wrong people.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.395
- What?
- And Rodrigo got mad at me.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.980
And we got into a fight,

05:13.063 --> 05:14.731
and then I accidentally killed him.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.983
- So you did kill Rodrigo!
- Yeah.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.776
- I told you he fucking killed him.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.237
- Yeah, that necklace?
That necklace was his necklace.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.322
I'm a horrible person.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.241
I'm going straight to hell.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.784
- You're goddamn right
you're going to hell.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.744
- Oh. Claude!
- Where are you going?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.079
- Where are you going, Ron?
- Claude!

05:29.162 --> 05:32.666
Claude, if you're watching,
you call the cops right now.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.501
You call the fucking cops.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.503
- Señor Wilcox!

05:36.587 --> 05:38.213
- Oh, shit!

05:38.297 --> 05:40.257
- My nephew Rodrigo's body washed up

05:40.340 --> 05:43.510
four miles due south of here!

05:43.594 --> 05:45.345
A coincidence, no?

05:45.429 --> 05:49.600
I'm gonna give you two minutes,
exactly dos minutos

05:49.683 --> 05:52.144
to bring your ass out here
and face me like a man!

05:52.227 --> 05:54.396
If not, I'm gonna set fire to the building

05:54.479 --> 05:56.440
and burn you like a chicharrón.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.068
- Snap out of it!

06:00.152 --> 06:01.820
- I can't. It's over.

06:01.904 --> 06:03.572
- Listen, you motherfucker.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.158
This is why men shouldn't be
left in charge of anything!

06:06.241 --> 06:08.660
My career is just now becoming the thing

06:08.744 --> 06:11.955
that I have worked my entire life towards!

06:12.039 --> 06:14.541
And I'm not dying because of you,
you fucking idiot!

06:14.625 --> 06:16.543
- Well, we-we're all gonna die!

06:18.295 --> 06:20.130
- Hey. Hey.
- Oh, shit.

06:20.214 --> 06:21.673
- What the fuck, man?

06:21.757 --> 06:24.259
Everybody got to calm the fuck down!

06:24.343 --> 06:25.719
- They're all blanks.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.304
- Hey, hey, look at me.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.764
- Don't hit me.
- What? I'm not gonna hit you.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.017
Look, when I first
walked through that door,

06:32.100 --> 06:34.186
you told me, you said, "Kevin,"

06:34.269 --> 06:36.605
you said, "An action hero is not in here."

06:36.688 --> 06:38.732
You said, "It's not in here."
- Uh-huh.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.651
- You said that it's here.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.402
It's in your heart.

06:42.486 --> 06:45.030
Now, granted,
you done made some mistakes.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.032
And one of those mistakes
involved murdering the nephew

06:47.115 --> 06:48.659
of some kind of a drug lord.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.203
- Oh, God!
- Okay, hey, hey. Hey, man.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.121
- I killed...
- I'm not trying

06:53.205 --> 06:55.207
to fucking upset you, man.
Listen.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.917
I know that you know...

06:57.000 --> 06:59.837
I know that you know that
there's an action hero in there.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.421
And I know that a true action hero

07:01.505 --> 07:04.091
is-is-is tough, is confident,

07:04.174 --> 07:06.635
and they're unfazed by the minor details

07:06.718 --> 07:08.679
that disrupt your average layperson.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.474
They will take responsibility
for their shit.

07:12.558 --> 07:14.893
You go out there,
and you tell the truth, man.

07:14.977 --> 07:16.436
Tell the fucking truth!

07:16.520 --> 07:19.398
Say Rodrigo's death...
say it was an accident.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.650
Say it was a fucking accident,
and give them...

07:21.733 --> 07:23.068
give them this.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.154
Here, you give them this,
say you want to make things right.

07:26.238 --> 07:27.865
- I'm gonna make it right.
- That's all you got to do.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.158
Say, "I want to make it right.
I'm sorry. I fucked up."

07:30.242 --> 07:31.994
- I fucked up.
- "I want to tell the truth."

07:32.077 --> 07:33.620
- Want to tell the truth.
- That's it.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.789
- I-I made a mistake.
- Okay, listen.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.750
All you got to do is be the action hero

07:38.834 --> 07:41.378
that you want to see in the world.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.633
- Thank you. Thank you.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.093
- Tell the truth, man.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.059
- That was amazing.

08:00.606 --> 08:02.941
- Amigos, amigos.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.276
Peace. Peace.

08:04.359 --> 08:06.028
- Paz. Paz. Paz.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.447
- Paz.
- Paz, paz, paz.

08:08.530 --> 08:11.033
- Holy shit, I think
it's actually working.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.410
Kevin, did you just save our lives?

08:13.493 --> 08:14.828
- No.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.415
I just know that being the hero means
owning up to your mistakes.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.376
I had to learn the same thing in my life.

08:21.460 --> 08:24.671
I'm just glad that Ron
can learn the same thing, too.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.802
Oh, shit!
