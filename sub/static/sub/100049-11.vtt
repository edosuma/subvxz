00:01.120 --> 00:04.250
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.250 --> 00:06.460
And then Uncle Clyde came
out of your room, and I
knew what he had done.

00:06.460 --> 00:08.330
Sometimes you got to do
what you got to do...

00:08.330 --> 00:11.620
even if all you've got
is a long match.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.580
I did everything I could
to help your father.

00:13.580 --> 00:14.580
And you failed.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.750
My pops was murdered
because of you.

00:16.750 --> 00:17.830
Stay the hell back.

00:17.830 --> 00:18.830
Time you finally
paid for that.

00:18.830 --> 00:20.210
I need you here right now.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.120
What's wrong?
Asher's here.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.380
He turned.

00:23.380 --> 00:24.420
Lanford:
Admit that you did all of it

00:24.420 --> 00:25.460
because you were under
the influence

00:25.460 --> 00:26.670
of Annalise Keating,

00:26.670 --> 00:28.080
and you'll get five years.

00:28.080 --> 00:28.960
Tegan:
Where's Annalise?
Bonnie: She's gone.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.710
That's why I'm here --

00:30.710 --> 00:32.170
to see if you helped her
disappear like you did Laurel.

00:32.170 --> 00:33.620
I'm only signing if you
agree to one more term.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.210
The terms are only valid

00:35.210 --> 00:37.420
if they apply to Connor
and myself.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.620
Agent Lanford.
You find Annalise Keating yet?

00:39.620 --> 00:41.710
Man: Annalise Keating?

00:41.710 --> 00:44.000
Seras extraditado de regreso
a los Estados Unidos

00:44.000 --> 00:46.040
en nombre del FBI.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.420
Guard?

01:05.420 --> 01:07.290
Someone needs to take care
of the baby.

01:07.290 --> 01:10.000
Guard!

01:23.170 --> 01:24.920
No.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.790
I'm gonna protect you!

01:26.790 --> 01:29.580
...protect you.

01:29.580 --> 01:31.540
I'm here for you.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.420
Ophelia:
What's the matter?

01:36.420 --> 01:39.290
It's just a dream.

01:39.290 --> 01:43.080
You were yelling
about some baby.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.290
Just go back
to sleep, Mama.

01:53.170 --> 01:54.460
Are you awake?

01:54.460 --> 01:55.460
Tegan:
It's 3:00 a.m.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.710
What the hell
you think?

01:56.710 --> 01:57.830
You wouldn't
be able to sleep

01:57.830 --> 01:59.330
with an old woman
in your bed either.

01:59.330 --> 02:00.790
How's she doing?

02:00.790 --> 02:02.080
Great, considering
I almost threw her

02:02.080 --> 02:04.000
over the balcony
a few times.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.250
That's one way to finally
get charged with murder.

02:06.250 --> 02:08.830
Judge Vitkay:
This is the arraignment
in Case 15 CR 116,

02:08.830 --> 02:11.170
the United States
vs. Annalise Keating.

02:11.170 --> 02:12.710
AUSA, what are the charges?

02:12.710 --> 02:14.620
Ms. Keating entered Mexico
with a passport

02:14.620 --> 02:16.080
under a false name.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.880
The government charges her
with one count

02:17.880 --> 02:20.620
of possession of a false
identification document

02:20.620 --> 02:22.790
and the related charge
of passport forgery.

02:24.670 --> 02:25.880
That's it?

02:25.880 --> 02:27.580
Yes, Your Honor.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.540
Ms. Keating, do wish to enter
a plea at this time?

02:29.540 --> 02:31.170
Not guilty,
Your Honor,

02:31.170 --> 02:34.000
and I'd like to request release
on my own recognizance.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.960
By definition, this crime makes
Ms. Keating a flight risk.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.790
We thereby forego bail

02:38.790 --> 02:41.040
and ask that the court place her
on house arrest, pending trial.

02:41.040 --> 02:42.830
I have an elderly mother
who has dementia,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.790
who requires my assistance
outside the home, Your Honor.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.380
You and I both know
how much worse

02:46.380 --> 02:48.670
these charges
could've been, Ms. Keating.

02:48.670 --> 02:52.460
What if I countersue for
suppression of evidence,

02:52.460 --> 02:54.880
argue that the government's
been hiding my real charges

02:54.880 --> 02:56.250
behind the passport fraud?

02:56.250 --> 02:59.790
Or you can take a moment to
think before poking the bear.

02:59.790 --> 03:01.830
I do better when
I'm on the attack.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.670
What about motioning for
a Bill of Particulars?

03:03.670 --> 03:05.750
The particulars
being a list of charges

03:05.750 --> 03:07.380
that can get you
put away for life?

03:07.380 --> 03:09.750
Well, at least I'd be able
to prepare a defense

03:09.750 --> 03:11.580
instead of watching my mother
watch stories all day.

03:11.580 --> 03:15.040
You want my opinion as your
lawyer or your friend?

03:15.040 --> 03:18.210
I don't want to get you
any more involved in this Hell.

03:18.210 --> 03:21.420
"He who represents himself
has a fool as a client."

03:21.420 --> 03:23.540
Aw, Abraham Lincoln
never met a lawyer

03:23.540 --> 03:25.710
as good as me
when he said that.

03:25.710 --> 03:27.790
True.

03:27.790 --> 03:29.500
But I'm here
if you need me.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.290
Like I'd be calling
your ass at 3:00 a.m.

03:31.290 --> 03:32.620
if I didn't
already know that.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.210
Okay, I'm gonna be your friend,
and I'mma let you sleep.

03:37.210 --> 03:38.830
I'm awake now.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.880
Aw, good night.

03:42.250 --> 03:45.500
Good night.

04:15.210 --> 04:16.670
Mama.

04:16.670 --> 04:18.170
I need those.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.380
Anna Mae!

04:21.380 --> 04:23.170
This ain't no spell.

04:23.170 --> 04:25.830
This is your mama knowing
you ain't sleeping right,

04:25.830 --> 04:27.920
all stressed out.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.420
Next thing you know, you'll be
sucking down alcohol

04:30.420 --> 04:32.040
out of everything
in this place.

04:32.040 --> 04:34.380
Mama, I haven't had
a drink in five months.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.080
Let's keep it
that way, honey.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.210
You know what?

04:39.210 --> 04:42.040
I came up with
a brainstorm this morning.

04:42.040 --> 04:45.790
How 'bout
we buy you a cat

04:45.790 --> 04:48.380
and we take
that ankle bracelet

04:48.380 --> 04:50.210
and put it on that thing

04:50.210 --> 04:52.500
and you go on about
your business?

04:53.880 --> 04:55.210
Great idea.

04:55.210 --> 04:56.330
Got a better one?
Where is it?
Yeah.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.420
Let me see it.

04:57.420 --> 05:00.000
My plan starts with
calling up Celestine

05:00.000 --> 05:01.920
to come back here
and take you home.

05:01.920 --> 05:03.620
That's not gonna
happen, honey.

05:03.620 --> 05:08.000
Because I'm here
to take care of you.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.500
Huh?

05:13.380 --> 05:14.620
Mmm.

05:14.620 --> 05:16.210
I knew that would do
the trick.

05:16.210 --> 05:17.330
Mm-hmm.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.460
Cookies
for breakfast?

05:26.460 --> 05:28.330
Asher's
snickerdoodles!

05:28.330 --> 05:29.960
If we can't go to
the funeral,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.880
I figure we honor him
by doing stuff he likes.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.290
Liked.

05:35.290 --> 05:36.670
Yes, we're in Hell,

05:36.670 --> 05:39.080
but let's just eat cookies
for breakfast until we get out.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.750
Ooh, God.
Ugh. Oh, God.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.120
Sorry.
What is that?

05:44.120 --> 05:45.710
I think I used
too much baking soda.

05:45.710 --> 05:48.120
I'll start over.

05:49.330 --> 05:51.080
He hasn't called.
I checked like two minutes ago.

05:51.080 --> 05:52.790
You want Lanford
to call?

05:52.790 --> 05:54.750
Well, you know,
just to let us know

05:54.750 --> 05:55.830
what we're supposed
to do here.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.080
Thought you were just
supposed to sit tight

05:57.080 --> 05:58.790
and wait for the trial.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.420
You mean the trial that they
still haven't set a date for,

06:00.420 --> 06:01.920
thereby giving Annalise
more time

06:01.920 --> 06:03.120
to figure out
we took a deal?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.540
Annalise isn't
gonna figure it out.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.540
Okay, she might
figure it out.

06:07.540 --> 06:08.330
Thanks for the comfort.

06:08.330 --> 06:09.540
Look, I'm just saying

06:09.540 --> 06:11.880
the FBI isn't gonna let
anything bad happen to us

06:11.880 --> 06:13.000
after what happened to
Asher.

06:14.790 --> 06:15.880
I'll shut up now.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.670
Thank you.
There you go.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.790
Annalise: Any word
on Michaela or Connor?

06:19.790 --> 06:21.330
Not a peep.

06:21.330 --> 06:22.670
Guilty as hell, right?

06:22.670 --> 06:24.460
Alright.
Here's my plan.

06:24.460 --> 06:25.920
We file a Bill of Particulars
with the judge.

06:25.920 --> 06:27.540
Bill of what?

06:27.540 --> 06:29.500
It'll force the AUSA
to reveal all the charges

06:29.500 --> 06:31.250
that they plan
to bring against me.

06:31.250 --> 06:33.330
Tegan can help you
if you need it.

06:33.330 --> 06:34.880
You're talking to Tegan
about your case?

06:34.880 --> 06:36.460
She's on our side,
right?

06:36.460 --> 06:37.670
She helped
Laurel disappear.
I trust her.

06:37.670 --> 06:40.620
You also trusted the kids.
Now look.

06:47.790 --> 06:50.000
If you want out,
I'll understand.

06:57.170 --> 07:00.330
Whatever crap
the FBI's got on you,

07:00.330 --> 07:02.080
they've got on us, too.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.960
We're gonna beat this.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.250
I'll file the bill with
the judge right away.

07:09.250 --> 07:11.620
You going to
Asher's funeral?

07:14.750 --> 07:15.880
He did this to himself.

07:20.620 --> 07:23.710
I got her.

07:29.420 --> 07:32.000
Chloe.
Asher's sister?

07:32.000 --> 07:33.250
I stopped by to get
a few of his things

07:33.250 --> 07:34.880
to put up at the funeral.

07:34.880 --> 07:35.830
I assume you're not going?

07:35.830 --> 07:37.420
Sorry?

07:37.420 --> 07:39.170
What killer wants to go
to his victim's funeral?

07:43.290 --> 07:45.210
Hey, I had nothing
to do with this.

07:45.210 --> 07:46.670
Then why did you lie
to the FBI?

07:46.670 --> 07:47.710
You're mistaken.

07:47.710 --> 07:50.960
Really? Am I?

07:55.500 --> 07:58.040
Asher called me from this phone
before he was killed.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.380
Give me one damn reason why
I shouldn't think it was you.

08:03.290 --> 08:04.580
Hey.

08:04.580 --> 08:05.620
What the hell?

08:05.620 --> 08:07.420
I'm fine.
Just -- I-I need your phone.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.790
For what?
It's an emergency.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.420
Give me your phone.
No.

08:10.420 --> 08:13.540
Wait. I'll pay you
$64,000 for it.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.380
Whose blood is that?
It's mine, okay?

08:15.380 --> 08:17.210
I-I took shrooms,
I fell down, I hit my head.

08:17.210 --> 08:18.500
You can ask Peyton.
She saw us all out.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.790
Now, please, please
give me your phone.

08:20.790 --> 08:22.880
Okay, just...stay.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.750
Wait.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.540
First, tell me if what I saw
on the news was true.

08:31.540 --> 08:32.620
W-What?

08:32.620 --> 08:34.250
Did Wes kill Sam
on his own?

08:34.250 --> 08:35.960
I-I have no idea.
Then bye.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.210
Look, okay, okay. I-I wasn't
there when any of it happened,

08:38.210 --> 08:40.540
but I was there after,

08:40.540 --> 08:43.040
and Wes is not the kind of guy
who could kill someone.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.330
So, he had help.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.080
I wasn't there,
but, yeah, I think so.

08:46.080 --> 08:47.210
From Annalise?
I don't know.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.670
Please, please,
your phone.

08:50.620 --> 08:52.080
Thank you. Here.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.670
No, you're clearly high.
There's no way I'm taking that.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.920
Collateral until
you get your phone back.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.750
Chloe: Whoever this is,
stop calling.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.120
Chloe, it's me.
Asher? Whose number
is this?

09:10.120 --> 09:11.500
Look, I need you
to come pick me up right now.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.830
I can't.
Chloe, what --

09:12.830 --> 09:13.920
I'm in Atlantic City.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.290
They found out, okay?

09:15.290 --> 09:17.500
Michaela, Connor, Oliver,
they found out.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.290
Asher.

09:22.290 --> 09:23.790
Swear on Dad's grave
you didn't tell them.

09:23.790 --> 09:26.080
No, I just -- Michaela asked,
and I couldn't lie.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.500
Idiot.
Just worried
that the --

09:27.500 --> 09:29.580
that the FBI won't go through
with the deal now.

09:29.580 --> 09:31.330
They have to.
No, the deal is contingent

09:31.330 --> 09:32.790
on me getting them evidence
that they can use at trial.

09:32.790 --> 09:34.460
I haven't given them that.

09:34.460 --> 09:35.920
Asher.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.210
It's gonna be fine.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.420
I call a car to come
get you right now.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.670
It's graduation night.
It's gonna...

09:41.670 --> 09:44.210
It's gonna take forever.
Just stay there.

09:44.210 --> 09:46.380
I'll text you at this number
when the car arrives, okay?

09:46.380 --> 09:47.750
Okay.

09:47.750 --> 09:49.080
Good.

09:49.080 --> 09:53.170
And you're not an idiot,
at least not more than me.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.420
Love you.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.330
Why did you lie to the FBI?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.830
I didn't. I-I just didn't think
they needed to know.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.250
My brother's dead,

10:00.250 --> 10:02.330
and my mother's probably
gonna kill herself, too.

10:02.330 --> 10:04.250
I will waterboard you
to get the truth.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.670
The FBI framed me
for terrorism last year,

10:06.670 --> 10:08.040
so they're not exactly
people I trust.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.500
Do I look like a moron?

10:09.500 --> 10:11.620
I can show you
court transcripts if you want.

10:11.620 --> 10:14.880
He was informing against
Annalise Keating.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.790
We both know she has something
to do with this.

10:18.710 --> 10:21.000
Well, hope the FBI
buys that story.

10:23.250 --> 10:25.710
Just...
don't say anything, okay?

10:25.710 --> 10:27.210
Dummy.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.880
The FBI's who told me
Asher used your phone.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.960
I'm just surprised I'm the one
who got to break the news.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.790
Bonnie: Asher looked out
for himself,

10:38.790 --> 10:42.250
just like
Connor and Michaela are now.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.120
Why aren't we?

10:44.120 --> 10:46.380
We need a plan, Frank.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.120
You mean a plan that doesn't
just involve you and me.

10:54.460 --> 10:56.880
What if Laurel
comes back

10:56.880 --> 10:59.580
and says all the things that
you've ever wanted to hear?

11:04.500 --> 11:07.250
I'll choose you.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.670
But you got to
choose me, too.

11:09.670 --> 11:12.960
You and Annalise have a bond
I'd never want to get between.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.170
You two don't?

11:14.170 --> 11:15.670
Sure.

11:15.670 --> 11:20.750
When it's all over,
it's you for me.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.040
But I don't know
who it is for you,

11:22.040 --> 11:23.880
and that's okay.

11:26.000 --> 11:29.460
She's the only reason
we're still here, Bon.

11:29.460 --> 11:30.880
You know that, too.

11:39.830 --> 11:42.210
Stop snooping.

11:42.210 --> 11:43.460
Who's Robert?

11:43.460 --> 11:44.670
No one.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.460
And I just got word that
the judge wants to see me.

11:47.460 --> 11:51.380
Because of
that Bill of Peculiarities?

11:51.380 --> 11:54.080
Keep eavesdropping on
my private conversations, Mama.

11:54.080 --> 11:56.210
I dare you.

11:56.210 --> 11:58.880
Well, what you gonna do,
kick me out? Huh?

11:58.880 --> 12:02.380
That would be just another
bad decision you're making.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.460
Only bad decision I've made
is you letting you come.

12:05.460 --> 12:08.290
I mean, who are you entrusting
your business to?

12:08.290 --> 12:11.580
That Bonnie and Clyde team
are shady.

12:11.580 --> 12:13.210
They have my back, Mama.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.290
And what happened
to Nathaniel?

12:15.290 --> 12:17.960
Nate is the last person who's
gonna help me out of this mess.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.830
Well, frankly, sweetheart,

12:19.830 --> 12:21.500
I think you need to
get yourself a lawyer.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.960
Mama, I'm the best lawyer
I know.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.250
How 'bout that
lesbian friend

12:26.250 --> 12:27.710
that you went
to law school with?

12:27.710 --> 12:31.000
Her name is Eve, Mama.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.670
And we were more
than just friends.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.960
You mean that
you were...

12:39.960 --> 12:42.460
Before Sam.

12:42.460 --> 12:43.880
That's why I went
into therapy.

12:47.620 --> 12:48.750
That's my ride.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.210
Anna Mae.

12:50.210 --> 12:51.540
Oh, Miss Ophelia.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.040
So good to see you!
Mm-hmm.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.040
I'll be back
in an hour, Mama.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.120
Love the sweater,
Miss O.

13:03.880 --> 13:06.000
But better, right?

13:09.040 --> 13:11.460
What are you doing?

13:11.460 --> 13:12.580
Michaela:
It's happening.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.120
What is?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.420
The reckoning.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.580
I just got off the phone
with my lawyer.

13:17.580 --> 13:20.040
Annalise filed a motion to get
a list of her future charges.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.000
So?
If Annalise wins,

13:22.000 --> 13:23.670
she'll know she's getting
charged for Sam.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.580
The only testimony
to support that

13:25.580 --> 13:27.040
would have to come from
the people who were there.

13:29.540 --> 13:32.620
Disclosing details
of an open investigation

13:32.620 --> 13:34.420
isn't necessary
until an indictment.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.250
Half of Philly thinks
I murdered my husband

13:36.250 --> 13:38.250
because of what the FBI
let slip to the press.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.960
That itself
is an indictment.

13:39.960 --> 13:43.080
Ms. Keating, DOJ guidelines
give the AUSA leeway

13:43.080 --> 13:45.880
over if and when to add
charges to your case,

13:45.880 --> 13:48.040
so even if I agreed with
your claim, legally --

13:48.040 --> 13:50.290
The law dictates you agree
with her, Judge.

13:50.290 --> 13:55.250
I'm sorry, are you part of
Ms. Keating's legal team?

13:55.250 --> 13:58.080
Yes. Ms. Price
is my co-counsel.

13:58.080 --> 14:00.420
Well, I don't have that name
anywhere in my paperwork.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.790
It's getting
filed today.

14:01.790 --> 14:04.120
Until then,
the United States v. Rosa

14:04.120 --> 14:05.960
allows you to force
the AUSA

14:05.960 --> 14:07.750
to reveal future charges

14:07.750 --> 14:10.120
when a defendant might face
prejudicial surprise at trial.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.500
AUSA Montes:
What surprise?

14:11.500 --> 14:14.080
Ms. Keating seems very sure
additional charges are coming.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.380
Only because of
the public lynching

14:15.380 --> 14:17.210
the FBI has given me
in the press.

14:17.210 --> 14:20.580
Your Honor...

14:20.580 --> 14:23.460
the government is deliberately
hiding its real case

14:23.460 --> 14:25.460
to deprive me of my
Fifth Amendment right

14:25.460 --> 14:26.670
to due process.

14:26.670 --> 14:29.040
Now, if Ms. Montes needs
a review of that law,

14:29.040 --> 14:31.710
I'm sure one of
my students can tutor her.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.500
We make a good team!

14:39.500 --> 14:40.960
You got to
give me that.

14:40.960 --> 14:42.830
I'll admit it
if I win my motion.

14:42.830 --> 14:45.670
"I" win or "we" win?

14:45.670 --> 14:46.750
You're hired.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.670
Ooh. Finally!

14:49.750 --> 14:51.710
High-five.

14:51.710 --> 14:53.580
Just this once.

14:54.960 --> 14:57.080
First order of business, you've
got to entertain my mother.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.420
I'd be honored.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.790
Mama?

14:59.790 --> 15:01.830
You taking a nap?

15:05.460 --> 15:06.710
Mama?

15:09.670 --> 15:10.750
Mama?

15:13.290 --> 15:14.880
Maybe she just went out
for a walk?

15:14.880 --> 15:16.500
Celestine's
gonna kill me.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.120
Gabriel: Asher!
It's Gabriel. Give me my phone!

15:31.120 --> 15:32.750
I need a few more minutes.
Go away.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.670
It's me.

15:53.670 --> 15:57.960
Uh, this isn't what
I wanted to have happen.

15:57.960 --> 15:59.920
But I just have to say this.

16:08.080 --> 16:09.920
My assistant said
you had an urgent matter.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.040
Yeah, um, Asher borrowed this
from me the night he died.

16:15.710 --> 16:17.000
Chloe Millstone
tell you?

16:17.000 --> 16:18.290
Does it matter?

16:18.290 --> 16:20.210
I brought it here, okay?
So just take it.

16:20.210 --> 16:22.460
I assume you deleted
anything incriminating

16:22.460 --> 16:24.620
that might explain
why you need a second phone.

16:24.620 --> 16:26.250
Your agents have a history
of framing me

16:26.250 --> 16:27.750
for crimes
that I didn't commit,

16:27.750 --> 16:30.210
so can't be too careful.

16:30.210 --> 16:31.830
Then let's talk about
the acts of violence

16:31.830 --> 16:34.620
you've committed
against Asher in the past --

16:34.620 --> 16:37.500
the courthouse fistfight
you instigated, for example.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.330
-Aah!
-Just stop!

16:40.330 --> 16:43.920
Asher borrowed my phone.

16:43.920 --> 16:46.000
That was the last time
that I saw him

16:46.000 --> 16:48.960
until I found his body
and I called 911.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.250
Okay.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.210
Let's amend
your statement.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.170
Did you check
the security footage?

17:00.170 --> 17:02.080
I don't care if
you just got on duty.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.580
Just check
every damn tape.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.420
Doorman didn't
see her leave,

17:05.420 --> 17:06.790
and I knocked on
every door I could.

17:06.790 --> 17:07.830
This is stupid.

17:09.330 --> 17:11.040
Your monitor! Annalise!
It's my damn mother.

17:11.040 --> 17:14.330
The judge
can kiss my ass.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.790
What is it?

17:26.080 --> 17:27.880
She's here.
Don't worry.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.000
Why didn't
you call me?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.250
She just showed up.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.080
Tell her I had
one of my spells.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.080
Bull, Mama!
We're all good.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.620
We're all good.
I'll drive her to you now.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.620
And, Nate,

17:36.620 --> 17:37.750
thank --

17:39.250 --> 17:40.500
Let's get you home.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.330
Not until
you explain yourself.

17:42.330 --> 17:46.380
I mean, how dare you
not stand by Anna Mae

17:46.380 --> 17:49.080
after all she's
done for you, Nathaniel.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.250
Miss Ophelia, if I may,
there's a lot more to the story

17:51.250 --> 17:53.210
than you know.
Oh.

17:53.210 --> 17:55.500
There's a lot more
to every story,

17:55.500 --> 17:57.580
like how Anna Mae
had the chance

17:57.580 --> 18:00.710
to turn against you
last Christmas.

18:00.710 --> 18:05.790
I mean, the FBI even offered her
a deal to turn you in,

18:05.790 --> 18:07.000
which she didn't take.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.500
You know why?

18:08.500 --> 18:11.170
'Cause she cared for you,
Nathaniel.

18:11.170 --> 18:12.380
Your daughter
made her own bed.

18:12.380 --> 18:15.960
She fought the Supreme Court
for your daddy.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.420
And I know you miss him,

18:17.420 --> 18:20.920
but you taking your pain
out on Anna Mae

18:20.920 --> 18:23.080
isn't the answer.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.380
That is not
what's going on.

18:24.380 --> 18:27.540
That's exactly
what's going on.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.710
It's written all over your face,
the guilt.

18:31.710 --> 18:33.290
You're guilty
because you're wrong,

18:33.290 --> 18:34.830
and you know you're wrong.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.710
With all due respect,

18:41.710 --> 18:43.670
the person you should be
talking to about all this

18:43.670 --> 18:45.380
isn't me.

18:45.380 --> 18:46.830
It's Annalise.

18:46.830 --> 18:48.500
Hmm.

18:48.500 --> 18:53.670
You think being so big
makes you tough?

18:53.670 --> 18:58.500
Then why don't stop acting
like a hurt little boy?

19:02.120 --> 19:04.420
Asher:
♪ I don't need no teacher ♪

19:04.420 --> 19:07.380
♪ You come on our turf,
we be like, "Bye, Felicia" ♪

19:07.380 --> 19:08.670
♪ "Bye, Felicia" ♪

19:08.670 --> 19:10.290
♪ "Bye, Felicia" ♪

19:10.290 --> 19:13.120
♪ You come on our turf,
we be like, "Bye, Felicia" ♪

19:15.620 --> 19:17.830
What if the deal
was a mistake?
Connor, don't.

19:17.830 --> 19:19.250
We agreed to a lie.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.620
I don't even know
how it happened.

19:20.620 --> 19:23.250
It happened because we finally
made a good choice.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.790
Or we panicked
and got played.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.420
No.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.330
We're just doing what we
should've done three years ago

19:29.330 --> 19:32.960
when we tried to go
to the police after Sam.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.620
And who stopped us?

19:34.620 --> 19:38.120
Her.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.960
By promising she wouldn't
let us get caught.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.580
And guess what?

19:43.580 --> 19:46.420
We got caught.

19:46.420 --> 19:49.880
We're finally
being smart.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.420
I'm not gonna feel bad
about that.

19:52.420 --> 19:53.790
Nate:
She okay?

19:53.790 --> 19:56.250
She was asleep as soon as
her head hit the pillow.

19:58.420 --> 19:59.830
Guess you got
what you wanted.

20:05.540 --> 20:07.170
Giving you
a chance to gloat.

20:07.170 --> 20:09.330
It's not something
I do often.

20:09.330 --> 20:12.000
Your mother already read me
pretty good.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.580
I want to feel bad
for you...

20:14.580 --> 20:16.460
but I don't.

20:19.540 --> 20:23.250
Next time you leave,
get some home care.

20:32.420 --> 20:36.290
Ophelia: I think
I got through to Nathaniel.

20:36.290 --> 20:39.710
I pulled his coattail
on a few things.

20:39.710 --> 20:42.750
Mama, you know I can take
care of myself, right?
Hmm?

20:42.750 --> 20:46.380
Nate or any man is not
the answer to my problems.

20:46.380 --> 20:48.710
I'm the answer
to my problems.

20:48.710 --> 20:53.420
Then why are you always in
trouble with the law, Anna Mae?

20:56.620 --> 20:57.750
I'm sorry.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.460
Are you?

20:59.460 --> 21:02.580
I just think sometimes
you might be a little confused.

21:02.580 --> 21:04.170
Me or you?

21:04.170 --> 21:08.290
I mean, just 'cause
you've been burned by some men,

21:08.290 --> 21:11.750
it doesn't mean
you write them all off

21:11.750 --> 21:13.670
and you go to lady town.

21:15.210 --> 21:18.330
Anna Mae, be honest.
Are you a lesbian?

21:18.330 --> 21:21.750
I don't know.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.170
How do you not know?

21:23.170 --> 21:27.080
You either like ladies,
or you don't.

21:27.080 --> 21:30.920
Well, like you said,
I'm confused.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.620
You know, I worry...

21:37.620 --> 21:41.250
this is all
because of Clyde.

21:41.250 --> 21:43.080
I've seen it happen --

21:43.080 --> 21:45.580
a woman gets messed with

21:45.580 --> 21:51.170
and doesn't want anything to do
with a man after that.

21:51.170 --> 21:53.330
I don't think
it's that simple, Mama.

21:53.330 --> 22:00.330
Remember all those boys I caught
you with in high school, hmm?

22:00.330 --> 22:05.920
Then comes Solomon, Sam,
Nathaniel.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.460
Maybe those men
were just me

22:07.460 --> 22:11.210
running away from
being different, Mama.

22:11.210 --> 22:14.460
Look where it got me --
right back where I was

22:14.460 --> 22:18.420
when you grounded me for
messing with all those boys,

22:18.420 --> 22:21.500
trapped at home
with my mother.

22:24.880 --> 22:28.750
Did you love her,
Anna Mae?

22:28.750 --> 22:30.540
Eve?

22:35.170 --> 22:36.420
I did.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.290
And she loved me.

22:44.210 --> 22:46.790
I was just scared.

23:03.040 --> 23:06.250
Do you want to make out?

23:06.250 --> 23:09.250
Grief sex is a thing
for a reason.

23:09.250 --> 23:11.750
Michaela: I'm coming in.

23:13.120 --> 23:15.380
My lawyer called again.
Annalise won her motion.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.120
She's gonna know it's us.

23:17.120 --> 23:20.250
Witness intimidation
of Simon Drake.

23:20.250 --> 23:23.420
Murder in the first degree
of Emily Sinclair.

23:23.420 --> 23:25.420
Murder in the first degree
of Rebecca Sutter.

23:25.420 --> 23:27.290
Everything from
Operation Bonfire.

23:27.290 --> 23:28.830
Everything
from the last three years,

23:28.830 --> 23:31.250
all stemming from this --

23:31.250 --> 23:33.170
murder in the first degree
of Sam Keating.

23:35.290 --> 23:36.790
Asher couldn't have
given them that.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.500
Exactly.
The little bitches turned.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.170
Can I go
rip their heads off now?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.710
No.

23:42.710 --> 23:43.790
We're gonna play nice.

23:48.330 --> 23:49.790
Annalise asked to see us.
What do we do?

23:49.790 --> 23:51.500
You go see her.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.540
No, she probably knows that
Connor and I took a deal.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.210
Yeah, isn't this when we go
into Witness Protection?

23:55.210 --> 23:56.710
Keating's elderly mother
is in town.

23:56.710 --> 23:57.960
You'll be fine.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.580
Oliver: No one is going
over there.

23:59.580 --> 24:01.830
Connor agreed to testify
at the trial. That's all.

24:01.830 --> 24:03.540
Incorrect, Oliver.

24:03.540 --> 24:05.960
Your husband will tell you
that clause 6-c of his deal

24:05.960 --> 24:07.880
requires
continued cooperation --

24:07.880 --> 24:09.500
same for Ms. Pratt

24:09.500 --> 24:10.710
and, frankly, same for you,

24:10.710 --> 24:12.500
if you don't want this
blowing up on them.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.880
What excuse they give?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.920
They're coming in an hour.

24:28.170 --> 24:31.710
I guess I just had to say this
so that you could understand --

24:31.710 --> 24:34.330
or at least try.

24:34.330 --> 24:36.210
Just don't hate me.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.830
Thank God.

24:52.830 --> 24:54.540
Where have you been?
I called you like 10 times.

25:04.580 --> 25:06.540
Asher:
No. Please don't.

25:20.580 --> 25:21.540
Vivian: It's Vivian.
Hit me at the beep.

25:22.710 --> 25:24.580
Hey, Ma.

25:25.920 --> 25:27.830
I need you.

25:32.420 --> 25:34.830
Ophelia: Well,
nobody wants sandwiches?

25:34.830 --> 25:37.710
They're peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.170
I made 'em myself.

25:40.170 --> 25:42.210
Unh-unh?
Don't want nothing to eat?

25:42.210 --> 25:45.710
Well, Anna Mae
got a swing set outside.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.170
Maybe you want to go out there
and play a little bit, hmm?

25:48.170 --> 25:49.420
Annalise: Mama.

25:49.420 --> 25:52.120
Maybe you want to
get some rest?

25:52.120 --> 25:56.460
Why you always
shoving me off someplace?

25:56.460 --> 25:58.500
I don't want to go to bed.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.420
It's not --
It's too early.
Yeah.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.880
That was an act, right?

26:04.880 --> 26:06.580
She has dementia.

26:06.580 --> 26:08.250
Or Annalise wants to play
the guilt card.

26:08.250 --> 26:09.290
Shh!

26:14.420 --> 26:16.750
She has her good days
and bad.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.330
She's not
the only one.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.420
I'm sorry about Asher.

26:25.420 --> 26:26.830
Are you?

26:26.830 --> 26:28.880
Okay.
Is this why you're here?

26:28.880 --> 26:32.170
To blame me for everything
once again?

26:32.170 --> 26:34.880
Look, you told us to come.
We came.

26:34.880 --> 26:38.670
Now that we're here,
just tell us.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.250
Was it you?
Did you kill Asher?

26:40.250 --> 26:42.170
Connor --
I can fight
my own battles, Oliver.

26:42.170 --> 26:45.380
Asher turned on all of us,
not just me.

26:45.380 --> 26:49.790
So, at some point, you may
want to turn on me next.

26:49.790 --> 26:51.120
Tell us why
we shouldn't.

26:51.120 --> 26:53.540
Because then
I'll turn on you,

26:53.540 --> 26:55.210
and then I'm gonna have
to tell the world the truth,

26:55.210 --> 26:57.710
that all I've ever done
is try to save you from
your own mistakes.

26:57.710 --> 26:59.750
I don't think that's
an accurate representation

26:59.750 --> 27:01.080
of the last few years.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.290
Say more, Oliver.

27:02.290 --> 27:04.080
Okay, if you were
really trying to save us

27:04.080 --> 27:05.830
from our own mistakes,

27:05.830 --> 27:08.040
then why did you take off
to Mexico without telling us?

27:08.040 --> 27:10.420
Oh. Oh, okay.
Is that what you're upset about?

27:10.420 --> 27:11.620
We're upset about
a lot right now.

27:11.620 --> 27:15.170
I ran away because
I was scared and dumb

27:15.170 --> 27:18.080
and I wasn't
thinking straight.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.710
And that's why I was caught --
that and your father.

27:21.710 --> 27:23.210
What?

27:23.210 --> 27:24.880
He didn't tell you that
he ratted me out to the FBI?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.500
Okay, what...

27:28.500 --> 27:30.120
What's the plan here?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.380
We just wait until
we get arrested, too?

27:32.380 --> 27:34.210
Or are you gonna sell us out
before your trial?

27:34.210 --> 27:35.500
No, I'm not gonna
sell you out,

27:35.500 --> 27:38.790
because then I'll look like
a fool for protecting you.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.580
Do I seem
like a fool to you?

27:41.580 --> 27:45.620
And if we can't trust
each other, what do we have?

27:46.880 --> 27:50.290
They turned, lied right
to my face -- and badly.

27:53.210 --> 27:54.420
What?

27:54.420 --> 27:56.420
You can't be surprised

27:56.420 --> 27:57.920
that they finally
chose themselves.

27:57.920 --> 27:59.380
I never said I was.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.290
You've been protecting them
for all these years.

28:01.290 --> 28:03.000
And you.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.290
So, I'm the same
as them to you?

28:08.670 --> 28:10.330
Where were you
that night?

28:10.330 --> 28:13.790
You mean the night that you left
without telling me?

28:13.790 --> 28:16.620
I came back for you,
Bonnie.

28:18.250 --> 28:20.250
Stop the car.
Turn around.

28:20.250 --> 28:22.420
Bonnie, open up!

28:22.420 --> 28:24.880
Bonnie, wake up!

28:29.620 --> 28:31.000
I went to your apartment

28:31.000 --> 28:34.580
to tell you that Asher
was the informant.

28:34.580 --> 28:37.920
Up until that night, he...

28:37.920 --> 28:39.580
he had never lied to me.

28:39.580 --> 28:44.290
I know, but you found out
what he was doing.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.580
And I know what
you've done before.

28:55.710 --> 28:58.250
It wasn't me.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.830
I believe you.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.670
I do.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.920
I get Annalise Keating's
your white whale,

29:17.920 --> 29:19.330
but you and I both know

29:19.330 --> 29:21.250
I'll knock out
half these charges pretrial,

29:21.250 --> 29:22.960
so let's cut some now
and not waste time.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.210
I assure you
we have evidence

29:24.210 --> 29:26.080
for every charge
against Ms. Keating.

29:26.080 --> 29:28.040
Computer trespass
and hacking?

29:28.040 --> 29:29.080
Have you seen
this woman type?

29:29.080 --> 29:30.290
She directed others
to do it.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.290
Ethnic intimidation?

29:31.290 --> 29:32.790
I think you have that one
backwards.

29:32.790 --> 29:35.460
And this here,
"aggravated arson."

29:35.460 --> 29:37.920
Annalise's house burnt down
because of a gas explosion.

29:37.920 --> 29:39.540
That's an official ruling.

29:39.540 --> 29:43.500
It's true, except you have
the wrong house.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.120
Looks like someone
needs to brush up

29:45.120 --> 29:46.620
on her client's
whole history.

29:51.250 --> 29:53.210
They're alleging
a pattern of arson

29:53.210 --> 29:55.250
based on the fire that
burnt down your childhood home.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.380
That's insane.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.170
Unless you did it.

29:58.170 --> 29:59.670
Was little Anna Mae
a fire starter?

30:03.080 --> 30:04.580
Hey.

30:04.580 --> 30:07.120
If there's anything
you need to tell me,

30:07.120 --> 30:08.330
now is the time.

30:08.330 --> 30:11.080
It wasn't me.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.420
But you know who it was?

30:12.420 --> 30:16.210
What matters is who gave
the FBI the article.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.330
Who is it?

30:22.330 --> 30:23.670
Nate.

30:23.670 --> 30:27.120
I could've
given them these.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.040
Denver files?

30:30.040 --> 30:31.750
You told me you
destroyed these already.

30:41.380 --> 30:44.080
Nate must've already
handed over copies of
the files to the FBI.

30:44.080 --> 30:45.290
Why would he do that?

30:45.290 --> 30:47.460
To cut his own deal.

30:47.460 --> 30:51.040
That S.O.B.

30:59.920 --> 31:03.000
Nathaniel ain't worth
one tear, you hear me?

31:03.000 --> 31:04.250
I know.

31:04.250 --> 31:06.290
I'm sorry I told you
to protect him.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.000
I thought he was better
than that.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.960
What man is ever
better than that?

31:09.960 --> 31:12.170
It ain't just men
you're mad at, baby.

31:12.170 --> 31:14.120
Let's not
go through this again.

31:14.120 --> 31:16.920
Because the person
you're most mad at,

31:16.920 --> 31:18.670
I'm afraid, is me.

31:23.330 --> 31:26.500
Clyde happened

31:26.500 --> 31:31.460
because I left you all alone
in that house so much.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.830
Clyde did that to me,
Mama, not you.

31:33.830 --> 31:35.290
But where was I?

31:35.290 --> 31:37.710
You were working two jobs
because Daddy left us.

31:37.710 --> 31:40.540
You're not hearing me,
Anna Mae.

31:40.540 --> 31:48.580
That baby in your dream you keep
trying to get to, huh?

31:48.580 --> 31:52.420
It's you.

31:52.420 --> 31:57.330
You never felt protected
as a little girl,

31:57.330 --> 32:01.210
and now,
all these years later,

32:01.210 --> 32:06.000
you still think you only
have you to lean on.

32:07.710 --> 32:10.540
No wonder you're exhausted.

32:10.540 --> 32:16.120
I'm just doing what I wish
someone would do for me.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.620
No.

32:17.620 --> 32:23.790
You're trying to be the parent
you felt you did not have.

32:23.790 --> 32:26.040
No, Mama. Listen.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.670
This is not your fault.

32:28.670 --> 32:32.500
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is,

32:32.500 --> 32:36.210
but Nathaniel,
those students,

32:36.210 --> 32:38.500
they're not your children,

32:38.500 --> 32:42.210
and you are not
their mother.

32:42.210 --> 32:46.750
The only one you need
to protect from now on

32:46.750 --> 32:49.500
is you, Anna Mae.

32:52.580 --> 32:58.170
They don't like it,
send them Mama's way.

32:58.170 --> 33:02.750
I'll teach 'em --
and good.

33:06.460 --> 33:08.080
Bless your heart.

33:15.830 --> 33:17.500
Michaela:
It smells like him.

33:17.500 --> 33:20.170
In a good way
or a bad way?

33:20.170 --> 33:21.790
In a sad way.

33:23.620 --> 33:24.670
Should we answer it?

33:24.670 --> 33:25.790
No.

33:25.790 --> 33:27.080
Gabriel: I can hear you
through the door.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.040
We're mourning our friend.
Go away.

33:32.170 --> 33:34.170
What, you all know
how to pick locks now?

33:34.170 --> 33:35.790
We used Laurel's key,
idiot.

33:35.790 --> 33:36.920
Why would Laurel
have a key?

33:36.920 --> 33:38.170
Because she lived here
before Asher.

33:38.170 --> 33:39.420
When?

33:39.420 --> 33:41.620
Okay, is this just your way
of deflecting blame

33:41.620 --> 33:43.330
for whatever you did
to Asher?

33:48.460 --> 33:50.290
I know from
personal experience

33:50.290 --> 33:52.000
that you are not
a hard sleeper,

33:52.000 --> 33:52.790
so maybe I should go
to the FBI

33:52.790 --> 33:53.960
and tell them that.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.540
Wait. Is Laurel back?

33:56.540 --> 33:57.790
No. Why?

33:57.790 --> 34:01.000
Nothing. Um, uh,
I'mma leave you be.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.250
That was weird, right?

34:15.500 --> 34:17.830
Agent Lanford, I need to
amend my statement.

34:17.830 --> 34:19.080
Again?

34:19.080 --> 34:20.960
Look, I think I know
who killed Asher.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.460
How?
I saw her do it.

34:22.460 --> 34:23.580
Her?

34:23.580 --> 34:24.830
...record saying anything ac--

34:24.830 --> 34:26.120
I-I think we should
call 911.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.380
Michaela:
Then call them!

34:27.380 --> 34:29.120
Um, I think it was
the mushrooms.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.710
Wait! Wait, wait.

34:30.710 --> 34:32.420
Asher.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.000
Asher?

34:34.000 --> 34:36.290
I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

34:45.710 --> 34:47.120
Laurel Castillo.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.750
I should've known.

34:59.750 --> 35:02.250
How?

35:02.250 --> 35:05.040
Nate told me
he was done with all of us.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.750
Yeah, he told me
that, too.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.710
I didn't think
he had it in him.

35:09.710 --> 35:11.710
He's not gonna have much left
in him once I get done.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.540
Don't go near him.

35:13.540 --> 35:15.420
He can't know
that we know.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.330
Go.

35:23.330 --> 35:24.670
Save yourselves.

35:24.670 --> 35:26.250
No.

35:26.250 --> 35:30.120
Listen, I was gonna leave you,
so go, disappear.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.080
We're saying no...

35:34.040 --> 35:37.330
...because it's always been
the three of us.

35:47.250 --> 35:52.420
They want to come after me,
call me an arsonist?

35:52.420 --> 35:54.460
Well, they better get ready
because we're gonna burn

35:54.460 --> 35:57.460
every last one of
those mother... down.

36:09.170 --> 36:11.330
What's wrong now?
Agent Lanford: Nothing.

36:11.330 --> 36:14.210
My Tech found something
I thought you'd like to see.

36:14.210 --> 36:16.120
Check your e-mail.

36:19.420 --> 36:20.250
I'm gonna open it.

36:24.540 --> 36:26.330
It's me.

36:26.330 --> 36:29.790
This isn't what
I wanted to happen.

36:29.790 --> 36:32.120
But I just have to say this.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.040
I'm not sorry for what I did.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.920
I chose my family,

36:36.920 --> 36:40.500
and maybe that makes me
a schmuck or soft,

36:40.500 --> 36:44.830
but I love them.

36:44.830 --> 36:46.580
And I love you guys, too.

36:46.580 --> 36:48.210
I mean that,

36:48.210 --> 36:53.250
which is why I need you to
hear me loud and clear here.

36:53.250 --> 36:55.330
You've all lost who you are.

36:55.330 --> 36:57.830
I can say that because
it happened to me, too.

36:57.830 --> 37:01.460
We all got caught up in
something much bigger than us.

37:01.460 --> 37:04.210
But you all still have
good in you.

37:04.210 --> 37:06.000
And, Connor...

37:06.000 --> 37:09.960
I mean, I thought gay
dudes were weird 'til I met you.

37:09.960 --> 37:15.120
Then you make the awesome
decision to marry Oliver?

37:15.120 --> 37:18.080
You two taught me
what real love looks like.

37:18.080 --> 37:20.670
And Michaela.

37:20.670 --> 37:22.330
Oh, Michaela.

37:22.330 --> 37:26.080
I love you so much.

37:26.080 --> 37:29.210
I always will.

37:29.210 --> 37:31.420
That's why I asked you
to marry me tonight,

37:31.420 --> 37:34.120
not as some stupid way
to protect us,

37:34.120 --> 37:37.380
but because I love you...

37:38.670 --> 37:41.670
...so much so that
I hoped I could save you

37:41.670 --> 37:43.120

that's gonna happen.

kind of too late,

being fun and funny

all the baking and dancing
