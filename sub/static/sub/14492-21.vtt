Hold it.

04:45.600 --> 04:46.680
What's this?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.360
Not in my shirt.

Good night.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.000
Oh.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.360
Dear, oh, dear.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.480
The late nights
are killing me.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.720
Oh, all right, oh,
what's happening there?

07:17.800 --> 07:20.200
Oh, forgotten about you.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.320
Right.

07:23.400 --> 07:24.960
Let me deal with you now.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.560
Here you go.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.080
Oh.

Oh.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.040
Oh, no.

07:50.120 --> 07:52.320
Where has it gone?

07:52.400 --> 07:55.480
No, where has it gone?

07:55.560 --> 07:56.600
Hello?

07:56.680 --> 07:57.720
Is it here?

07:57.800 --> 07:59.040
Oh.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.920
Oh, this is where you are.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.480
Come on now.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.480
Hmm?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.640
What do you?

08:10.720 --> 08:12.800
Oh,

08:12.880 --> 08:14.800
you want to go over there.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.400
Huh?

08:26.480 --> 08:27.480
Oh, what?

08:27.560 --> 08:28.720
Get away, you.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.920
Shoo. Shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.880
Hmm. Oh.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.400
Oh.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.800
Yeah.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.840
Where are you?

09:14.520 --> 09:16.120
Hmm, what's that?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.800
Oh, no, no.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.680
Hold that there.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.440
Score. Argh!

09:50.800 --> 09:52.520
Aye, look at that.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.000
Oh, my goodness,
you're a beauty.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.080
On the hook there.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.600
Oh. Whew!

10:09.040 --> 10:10.320

Oh.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.960
Ugh.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.520
If you insist.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.080
I'm in.

10:36.160 --> 10:37.240
Enjoy your trip.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.960
Okay.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.960
Oh. Woo.
