00:02.101 --> 00:03.768
How about a neurosurgeon?       

00:03.835 --> 00:05.236
No, thanks. I'm in a toast mood.

00:05.304 --> 00:07.071
Salem's filling out             
a questionnaire                 

00:07.139 --> 00:08.607
for his high                    
school reunion.                 

00:08.674 --> 00:10.708
          Apparently,           
    it's a work of fiction.     

00:10.776 --> 00:13.111
     "I perform lobotomies      
    in the off-season           

00:13.178 --> 00:15.113
when I'm not playing free safety
    for the Dallas Cowboys."    

00:15.180 --> 00:16.414
     You left out the part      

00:16.481 --> 00:18.449
      where you sit around      
     and scratch your butt.     

00:18.517 --> 00:20.184
         This reunion's         
      going to be great--       

00:20.252 --> 00:21.386
seeing all my old cronies,      

00:21.454 --> 00:23.154
    pretending I know           
        about the brain.        

00:23.222 --> 00:24.889
How are you going               
to explain the fact             

00:24.957 --> 00:26.691
that you now have               
four legs, pointy ears,         

00:26.759 --> 00:28.960
    and a furry belly,          
      Mr. Convicted Felon?      

00:29.028 --> 00:30.394
I got it all figured out.       

00:30.462 --> 00:32.831
No one will care that I slipped 
  up playing the morality game  

00:32.898 --> 00:35.033
    as long as I walk           
    into that reunion           

00:35.100 --> 00:37.602
     with a gorgeous trophy     
        on my arm.              

00:37.670 --> 00:38.570
        Allow me.               

00:39.572 --> 00:42.073
(groaning)                      

00:42.141 --> 00:44.342
        (weakly):               
      I meant Susan Anton.

01:19.845 --> 01:21.679
So it's my first issue          
as newspaper editor,            

01:21.747 --> 01:23.414
so I need a lead story          
that's explosive,               

01:23.449 --> 01:24.582
that's exclusive,               

01:24.650 --> 01:26.350
something that's                
front-page material.            

01:26.418 --> 01:27.718
            Well, I'm willing   
                     to give you

01:27.786 --> 01:29.487
              an inside scoop on
              the football team.

01:29.555 --> 01:30.622
                      I made the
                    first string

01:30.689 --> 01:32.790
            of people who are up
        for the first string.   

01:32.858 --> 01:35.393
Congratulations, but what       
I really need is a war.         

01:35.461 --> 01:36.427
        (bells tinkling)        

01:36.495 --> 01:37.828
    Hey, what are you doing?    

01:39.065 --> 01:40.765
        I did a "kiss me" spell.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.933
        It's a fast and easy way
         to make mortal friends.

01:43.001 --> 01:45.169
Yeah, if you want to be         
called fast and easy.           

01:45.237 --> 01:47.004
    Ms. Editor, have we got     

01:47.072 --> 01:48.973
                 a headline yet?

01:49.040 --> 01:50.008
        (bells tinkling)        

01:50.075 --> 01:51.076
              Ooh!              

01:51.143 --> 01:53.144
        Oh, my...               

01:53.212 --> 01:54.512
                A public display
                of affection,   

01:54.580 --> 01:58.450
    although never practiced    
in my family, is healthy.       

01:58.518 --> 01:59.584
          Tell no one.          

01:59.652 --> 02:01.553
See, in the Mortal Realm,       

02:01.621 --> 02:03.888
making friends                  
takes time.                     

02:03.955 --> 02:05.723
DREAMA:                         
That girl's got                 
lots of friends.                

02:11.831 --> 02:13.598
            Ah, Miss Spellman...

02:13.666 --> 02:16.734
             Miss, uh, new girl.

02:16.802 --> 02:18.636
Loitering in the hallway.       

02:18.704 --> 02:20.838
Loitering next to Miss Spellman.

02:20.906 --> 02:22.840
     You know, I should get     
these detention slips printed up

02:22.908 --> 02:24.409
     with <i>your</i> letterhead.      

02:25.077 --> 02:26.177
A Mont Blanc pen?               

02:26.244 --> 02:27.378
     Where'd you get that?      

02:27.446 --> 02:30.014
          At the "None          
    of your business" store.    

02:32.584 --> 02:34.819
        (engine revving)        

02:34.886 --> 02:37.455
    (music playing on radio)    

02:37.523 --> 02:40.024
          I'm cruisin' to find a
        date for the reunion.   

02:40.091 --> 02:42.193
  The babes love a sports car.  

02:42.261 --> 02:44.829
They particularly like one      
        they can fit in.        

02:44.896 --> 02:47.798
You know nothing                
about women.                    

02:49.101 --> 02:50.034
                 I don't get it.

02:50.102 --> 02:51.569
                  My doctor says
                     I'm anemic,

02:51.637 --> 02:53.137
            but I've been eating
              all this red meat.

02:53.205 --> 02:54.973
It's more like                  
blue-gray meat.                 

02:55.040 --> 02:56.474
            Is it just me or has
              the cafeteria food

02:56.542 --> 02:57.742
         gotten worse this year?

02:57.810 --> 02:58.776
    (student vomiting)          

02:58.844 --> 03:01.145
It's not just you.              

03:01.213 --> 03:02.981
So what do you think            
about this for my front page?   

03:03.048 --> 03:05.917
It's completely blank except    
for the headline, which reads,  

03:05.984 --> 03:08.353
"No news is good news."         

03:08.421 --> 03:09.521
            Of course, if you   
                    decide to go

03:09.589 --> 03:11.356
    with the me maybe making    
      first string story,       

03:11.423 --> 03:14.125
 I'll be available for photos.  

03:14.193 --> 03:15.993
      I'll have my people       
    call your people.           

03:17.996 --> 03:19.497
  Should meat sweat like that?  

03:24.536 --> 03:26.304
     Dreama, what happened?     

03:26.372 --> 03:27.338
            I'm not really hurt,

03:27.405 --> 03:29.039
             but look at all the
            friends I've got,   

03:29.107 --> 03:31.208
            and I might even get
            handicapped parking.

03:33.078 --> 03:34.979
Dreama, there's more to life    

03:35.047 --> 03:37.148
than getting into 7-Eleven      
before everyone else.           

03:39.851 --> 03:42.420
      Sorry, I should have      
      zapped in a pillow.       

03:42.487 --> 03:44.655
Wow, nice                       
running shoes...                

03:44.723 --> 03:46.157
          and pricey.           

03:46.224 --> 03:47.358
            Mm-hmm.             

03:47.426 --> 03:50.361
 The better to chase you with,  
            my dear.            

03:51.396 --> 03:53.097
        No gum-chewing.         

03:53.165 --> 03:55.733
             Heel-toe, heel-toe,
             heel-toe, heel-toe.

03:55.801 --> 03:57.301
         (door closing)         

03:57.369 --> 03:59.036
         What does this         
    look like to you?           

03:59.104 --> 04:00.839
    Um... drain clog?           

04:00.906 --> 04:02.340
        Ooh, bad toupee?        

04:02.408 --> 04:05.042
      This is what Harvey       
  was eating for lunch today.   

04:05.110 --> 04:06.811
You're never having dinner      
     at the Kinkles' again.     

04:06.879 --> 04:10.281
  Come on, we've got to get to  
our Witch Watch Workshop. Weady?

04:10.349 --> 04:12.083
We just found out               
from the Witches' Council       

04:12.151 --> 04:13.851
          that we have          
to be trained and licensed      

04:13.919 --> 04:15.153
     to run the clock shop.     

04:15.221 --> 04:16.853
Oh... good luck.                

04:16.922 --> 04:19.357
 And try not to come home while 
  I'm throwing my huge party.   

04:19.425 --> 04:20.658
                     Very funny.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.727
          While we're gone, will
    you keep an eye on Salem?   

04:22.794 --> 04:24.129
Why? He's a grown... cat.       

04:24.196 --> 04:25.730
                      Well, he's
                  having trouble

04:25.797 --> 04:27.197
                  finding a date
            for this reunion,   

04:27.265 --> 04:29.133
                and I think it's
                 depressing him.

04:29.201 --> 04:30.134
                  ¶ Nah-nah... ¶
Salem, are you okay?            

04:30.201 --> 04:31.235
                      I was fine

04:31.303 --> 04:33.304
      until you stepped on      
          my nah-nahs.          

04:33.372 --> 04:35.440
 I have six dates for tonight.  

04:35.507 --> 04:37.876
     Driving the prison van     
  does not constitute a date.   

04:37.943 --> 04:40.544
        No, I put an ad         
 in the <i>Other Realm</i> personals.  

04:40.612 --> 04:43.181
     I'm meeting six ladies     
      and I have to decide      

04:43.248 --> 04:46.851
which one is going to be Salem's
arm candy for the reunion.      

04:48.153 --> 04:49.053
            (grunts)            

04:49.120 --> 04:50.054
              Aah!              

04:50.122 --> 04:51.589
              Guh!              

04:51.656 --> 04:52.890
              Ahh!              

04:52.958 --> 04:55.026
        (groans in pain)        

04:55.094 --> 04:56.895
              Ooh!              

04:59.197 --> 05:00.698
    (quizzical grunt)           

05:00.766 --> 05:03.334
  We didn't have any iced tea.  

05:05.203 --> 05:06.403
                Is that a purse?

05:06.471 --> 05:07.906
         It's European.         

05:07.973 --> 05:09.407
Get some culture.               

05:09.475 --> 05:11.810
          Mrs. Quick, I've got a
    story for the front page.   

05:11.844 --> 05:13.344
I'm all ears, Sabrina.          

05:13.412 --> 05:15.947
                Day after day, I
              watch my boyfriend
          eat massive quantities

05:16.015 --> 05:17.749
        of so-called red meat   
             from the cafeteria.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.049
I know you're young             
and in love,                    

05:19.117 --> 05:20.517
but give me a headline          
I can use.                      

05:20.585 --> 05:21.686
            "Cafeteria-gate."   

05:21.754 --> 05:23.320
            I suspect there's no
              ham in the burger,

05:23.388 --> 05:25.255
        no meat in the loaf, and
        no sloppy in the joe.   

05:25.323 --> 05:26.724
                  Well, you know
                    what I mean.

05:26.792 --> 05:27.992
A meat scandal. Perfect.        

05:28.060 --> 05:29.861
We'll blow the lid              
off this school...              

05:29.929 --> 05:31.328
right after the pep rally.      

05:31.396 --> 05:33.631
     Just as I suspected--      
        there is no meat        

05:33.699 --> 05:35.099
    in this Salisbury steak,    

05:35.167 --> 05:37.435
                  but there is a
             family of paramecia

05:37.503 --> 05:38.936
and even they're gagging.       

05:39.004 --> 05:40.638
Can I have my lunch back?       

05:40.705 --> 05:42.574
    Sabrina, remember           
      how you were looking      

05:42.641 --> 05:45.142
      for the perfect lead      
 to break your lunchroom story? 

05:45.210 --> 05:46.845
                        Yeah?   
     I've got it, baby!         

05:47.412 --> 05:49.647
        Walk, don't run.        

05:52.351 --> 05:55.019
Ooh, I can see the headlines    
now: "Kraft gets chair."        

05:55.087 --> 05:56.454
        Open your eyes, girl.   

05:56.521 --> 05:58.723
      He's only a civil servant,
    and there ain't no budget   

05:58.790 --> 06:00.157
    for a Chippendale settee.   

06:00.225 --> 06:01.859
So if the school money          
isn't going to buy meat,        

06:01.894 --> 06:04.462
then it must be going to...     

06:08.467 --> 06:11.369
        Mr. Kraft.              

06:11.437 --> 06:12.670
         Be my friend.          

06:12.738 --> 06:14.138
            Be my friend.       

06:14.206 --> 06:15.673
         I have a pool.         

06:18.043 --> 06:19.144
             Salem!             

06:19.211 --> 06:22.180
      I'm checking on you       
like I promised my aunts.       

06:22.247 --> 06:23.281
        "Forget my name.        

06:23.349 --> 06:24.916
          "I've joined          
the French foreign legion.      

06:25.017 --> 06:26.384
         Love, Salem"?          

06:26.451 --> 06:28.453
        (sobbing)               

06:30.255 --> 06:31.588
      (sobbing continues)       

06:31.656 --> 06:35.093
I over-packed my pack.          

06:35.160 --> 06:36.460
I'm really busy at school,      

06:36.528 --> 06:37.895
    so if you're going          
     to run off to Algeria,     

06:37.963 --> 06:39.029
 wait until my aunts come home. 

06:39.097 --> 06:41.565
      I can't find a date       
        for the reunion.        

06:41.633 --> 06:42.566
So? You'll go stag.             

06:42.634 --> 06:44.002
I'm sure                        
you can pick up                 

06:44.069 --> 06:45.937
some neglected wife             
at the bar.                     

06:46.004 --> 06:48.005
                 You can't cheer
                 me up, Sabrina.

06:48.073 --> 06:50.174
        There's...              
something you don't know.       

06:50.241 --> 06:53.077
        I wasn't always         
  the stud muffin I am today.   

06:53.145 --> 06:56.180
         (whimpering):          
I was a high school nerd.       

06:56.248 --> 06:58.216
        Do the...               
(imitates flashback sound)      

06:58.283 --> 07:00.818
and I'll tell you all about it. 

07:00.886 --> 07:02.854
    (flashback music)           

07:02.922 --> 07:06.424
        (Salem sobbing)         

07:06.492 --> 07:10.294
                     Billy Luto,
                you let me down.

07:10.362 --> 07:12.930
     ¶ Salem is a weenie ¶      

07:12.998 --> 07:14.865
¶ We hung him by his... ¶       

07:15.834 --> 07:17.434
          ¶ Heenie! ¶           

07:17.502 --> 07:18.770
             BOYS:              
     ¶ Salem is a weenie ¶      

07:18.837 --> 07:20.204
¶ We hung him by his... ¶       

07:20.272 --> 07:22.539
             No...!             

07:22.607 --> 07:24.909
        (sobbing):              
        The flashbacks!         

07:24.977 --> 07:27.078
    Wow. For the first time,    
    you seem so vulnerable.     

07:27.146 --> 07:30.448
     I so wanted to go back     
      to school a winner.       

07:30.516 --> 07:31.883
 But, Salem, you <i>are</i> a winner.  

07:31.950 --> 07:33.084
         You've got...          

07:33.151 --> 07:34.285
        Well, there's...        

07:34.352 --> 07:35.452
         What about...?         

07:35.520 --> 07:36.688
  Okay, you know what, Salem?   

07:36.755 --> 07:39.556
I promise, I will find you      
    a date for the reunion.     

07:39.624 --> 07:41.358
         A trophy date.         

07:41.426 --> 07:42.894
Sometimes it's hard             
to make new friends.            

07:42.961 --> 07:44.062
Maybe you have                  
an ex-girlfriend                

07:44.129 --> 07:45.863
you want to take with you       
to the reunion.                 

07:45.931 --> 07:47.264
          Great idea.           
    I had a million of them.    

07:47.332 --> 07:48.432
Oh, yeah.                       

07:48.500 --> 07:49.834
        That's why              
     your little black book     

07:49.902 --> 07:52.202
    is practically the size     
  of the new York phone book.   

07:52.270 --> 07:54.038
     Let's see, what about,     
    uh, Sarah Philips?          

07:54.105 --> 07:55.740
    I'd love to go with her.    

07:55.808 --> 07:59.376
    She was always so sweet,    
    so warm, so nurturing...    

08:00.478 --> 08:02.213
    (thunder and lightning)     

08:02.281 --> 08:05.716
    So desperate for commitment.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.054
      Not-not to be picky,      
     but how about someone      

08:10.121 --> 08:12.890
    for whom dating doesn't     
      constitute adultery?      

08:12.958 --> 08:15.726
     Well, I don't know how     
to make out her last name,      

08:15.794 --> 08:17.528
  but... what about... Hallie?  

08:17.596 --> 08:20.030
         Yeah. She was          
      drop-dead gorgeous.       

08:20.098 --> 08:22.600
 I wonder why we ever broke up? 

08:22.667 --> 08:24.434
    (thunder and lightning)     

08:25.437 --> 08:27.371
          Hey, Salem.           

08:27.439 --> 08:30.507
                (gagging)       

08:31.543 --> 08:32.676
        Now I remember.         

08:32.744 --> 08:34.544
         Hallie Tosis.          

08:34.613 --> 08:36.212
                        (choking
                    and gagging)

08:36.280 --> 08:38.682
        Her breath              
    could start the windmill    

08:38.750 --> 08:40.784
on an old Dutch painting.       

08:40.852 --> 08:43.321
That's the only other name      
in here except for... Mom.      

08:43.388 --> 08:45.189
        Uh... ink fades.        

08:45.257 --> 08:46.958
      Well, I really have       
     to get back to school      

08:47.025 --> 08:48.259
 and crack the Mr. Kraft case.  

08:48.326 --> 08:49.927
      Because Salem needs       
    a date really fast          

08:49.995 --> 08:51.996
send him someone he truly loved 
         from the past.         

08:52.064 --> 08:54.698
    (thunder and lightning)     

08:56.368 --> 08:58.102
            From your <i>Harold</i>    
             <i>and Maude</i> phase?   

08:58.170 --> 08:59.203
    Oh, don't be sick.          

08:59.271 --> 09:01.805
        She's a lady who        
was handing out fish yesterday. 

09:01.873 --> 09:03.073
I'll find                       
you a date                      

09:03.141 --> 09:04.508
     as soon as I get back      
          from school.          

09:07.146 --> 09:08.913
     Got any trout on you?      

09:08.981 --> 09:09.981
                 Oh, I'm so glad

09:10.048 --> 09:11.648
              we got into Father
                Time's workshop.

09:11.716 --> 09:13.650
             It's supposed to be
              very intellectual.

09:13.718 --> 09:16.787
I know, I know, he's going      
 to teach us to "be the clock." 

09:16.855 --> 09:19.657
    Trust me, you'll be glad    
    you stuck it out.           

09:21.260 --> 09:22.593
          (bell tolls)          

09:23.795 --> 09:26.664
Oh, yeah, I'm really glad       
        we stuck it out.        

09:26.732 --> 09:29.533
    There's got to be some proof
    he's funneling the money.   

09:29.601 --> 09:31.069
Yeah, some kind                 
of an invoice                   

09:31.136 --> 09:33.137
or a phone message              
or a pacifier...                

09:33.205 --> 09:34.404
        Oh, the horror!         

09:34.472 --> 09:35.840
Hey! What are you doing?        

09:35.908 --> 09:37.908
                      Mr. Kraft!

09:37.976 --> 09:39.544
      We just wanted to show you
        Mrs. Quick's new camera.

09:39.611 --> 09:40.478
     Show him, Mrs. Quick.      

09:40.545 --> 09:42.446
Okay, well, we'll see           
you on the way down.            

09:42.514 --> 09:43.747
I mean... later.                

09:49.488 --> 09:50.755
                Hey, Sabrina.   

09:50.823 --> 09:52.890
        I read that pets        
are the best way to meet people.

09:52.957 --> 09:53.958
I love your kitty.              

09:53.993 --> 09:54.958
                It's working.   

09:54.927 --> 09:56.727
         (bell ringing)         

09:59.231 --> 10:00.498
Okay, where's my 50 bucks?      

10:00.566 --> 10:02.199
                      She talks?

10:02.267 --> 10:03.134
  And if you want her to stop,  

10:03.201 --> 10:04.368
                  it's 50 bucks.

10:04.435 --> 10:05.770
                      I'm sorry.
                She was supposed

10:05.837 --> 10:07.371
                     to keep her
            furry mouth shut.   

10:07.438 --> 10:09.106
                 She only thinks
                  about herself.

10:09.174 --> 10:11.041
Really, that self-centered?     

10:11.109 --> 10:12.410
Is she single?                  

10:12.478 --> 10:15.813
     You want to set me up      
    with this pinhead?          

10:15.881 --> 10:17.315
            Somebody's cranky   
                 'cause they got

10:17.383 --> 10:20.451
                 hit in the face
              with a frying pan.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.953
    Oh, I must have entered     
        a wit-free zone.        

10:23.021 --> 10:24.689
What a disaster.                

10:24.756 --> 10:26.790
                What a woman!   

10:31.596 --> 10:33.164
You graduated                   
from Other Realm High           

10:33.232 --> 10:34.832
the year before me?             

10:34.899 --> 10:35.833
Wait a minute.                  

10:35.900 --> 10:38.069
Juliette Jingleheimer?          

10:38.137 --> 10:39.803
The prom queen?                 

10:39.871 --> 10:41.905
                    In person...
                    so to speak.

10:41.973 --> 10:43.307
      Salem, why don't you      
         tell Juliette          

10:43.374 --> 10:44.809
 about some of your... hobbies? 

10:44.876 --> 10:46.076
Psst, psst!                     

10:46.144 --> 10:47.845
I can strut my own stuff.       

10:47.913 --> 10:51.048
I like fish.                    

10:51.116 --> 10:52.783
So, are you working on          
the homework I assigned you?    

10:52.851 --> 10:56.186
                 Yup. The "Kraft
                true confessions
             potion" is brewing.

10:56.254 --> 10:57.822
Great. Now, tomorrow            
you'll slip him the Mickey,     

10:57.889 --> 11:00.057
and then he'll confess          
the whole thing and             
I'll have my story.             

11:00.125 --> 11:02.626
     And there's no way we      
  could get arrested for this?  

11:02.694 --> 11:04.328
         There's no way         
  <i>I</i> could be arrested for this. 

11:04.396 --> 11:05.729
            Come on Juliette,   
            we have to get home.

11:05.797 --> 11:06.730
             Wait!              

11:06.798 --> 11:08.032
Uh, Juliette, I know            

11:08.099 --> 11:10.501
we haven't known                
each other very long,           

11:10.569 --> 11:13.203
 and, I, uh... how do I, uh...? 

11:13.271 --> 11:14.605
I was wondering if I...         

11:14.673 --> 11:16.740
     Would you come with me     
         to my reunion?         

11:16.808 --> 11:17.842
            Why not?            

11:17.910 --> 11:19.343
                    Bye.        

11:19.410 --> 11:22.780
    Glory be! I have a date,    
     and not just any date.     

11:22.848 --> 11:25.916
     She's the coolest gal      
     from Other Realm High.     

11:25.984 --> 11:27.251
                     And you owe
                it all to me.   

11:27.319 --> 11:30.021
    Exactly, and that's why     
     I'm going to warn you      

11:30.088 --> 11:32.189
 that I'm about to sing "Lady." 

11:32.257 --> 11:33.357
(laughing)                      

11:37.062 --> 11:38.428
                 So you gave Mr.
            Kraft the potion?   

11:38.496 --> 11:39.831
            Yes. I slipped it   
                in his V8 juice.

11:39.898 --> 11:41.131
                  Great. So he's
                ready to confess

11:41.199 --> 11:42.867
          and he's met          
his daily vegetable requirement.

11:42.934 --> 11:44.068
          Here he is.           
         Let's get him.         

11:44.136 --> 11:45.268
                Uh, Mr. Kraft...

11:45.336 --> 11:46.637
    is there anything           
     you'd like to confess      

11:46.705 --> 11:47.971
about the meat in the cafeteria?

11:48.039 --> 11:50.140
          (whinnying)           

11:50.208 --> 11:52.376
         Oh, pardon me.         

11:53.311 --> 11:55.012
                Let me guess.   

11:55.080 --> 11:58.082
 You put the confession potion  
together in one big horse pill? 

11:58.150 --> 11:59.316
How'd you know?                 

11:59.384 --> 12:00.551
         (bell ringing)         

12:00.619 --> 12:02.253
                Go make some    
                more friends.   

12:02.320 --> 12:03.788
Sabrina, good news.             

12:03.855 --> 12:07.124
I've been contacted             
by a secret informant.          

12:07.192 --> 12:09.293
    This person works           
        in the cafeteria        

12:09.360 --> 12:11.829
      and goes by the name      
    of "sore throat."           

12:11.897 --> 12:13.264
  That's great. When and where  
        can we meet him?        

12:13.331 --> 12:14.899
Tonight in the cafeteria.       

12:14.967 --> 12:18.736
Mr. Kraft will rue the day      
  he ever-- did the bell ring?  

12:18.804 --> 12:19.870
     About ten seconds ago.     

12:19.938 --> 12:20.971
        Oh, shoot.              

12:22.106 --> 12:24.475
  Salem, what are you holding?  

12:24.543 --> 12:27.044
            And it better not   
            be another subpoena.

12:27.112 --> 12:29.913
It's a letter                   
from my lady-- Juliette.        

12:29.981 --> 12:31.915
     She's crazy about me.      

12:31.983 --> 12:34.051
    "Salem, remember to get     
        my kidney pate."        

12:34.119 --> 12:36.220
    Well, I guess for a cat     
        that's romantic.        

12:36.287 --> 12:37.521
     It's not what she said     

12:37.589 --> 12:39.756
    but that she took           
      the time to say it.       

12:39.824 --> 12:41.291
      Man, you got it bad.      

12:41.359 --> 12:42.426
    Behold the manifestation    

12:42.494 --> 12:43.861
of my affection.                

12:43.929 --> 12:45.262
                 "S.S. plus J...

12:45.330 --> 12:46.797
        squiggly line"?         

12:46.865 --> 12:48.065
    My affection is endless,    

12:48.133 --> 12:50.600
         (whimpering):          
     but my nails are not.      

12:50.668 --> 12:51.469
         Hello, honey.          

12:51.536 --> 12:53.504
Is there any                    
particular reason               

12:53.572 --> 12:55.205
      you two are dressed       
      like the Ricola man?      

12:55.273 --> 12:58.342
 Oh, dear Lord, we were in such 
  a hurry to get out of there   

12:58.409 --> 13:00.044
we left on our lederhosen.      

13:00.111 --> 13:01.479
They're deceptively comfortable.

13:01.513 --> 13:03.280
        (Salem giggling)        

13:03.348 --> 13:05.749
         Oh, a corsage?         

13:05.817 --> 13:07.818
 Anything for my dear Juliette. 

13:07.886 --> 13:09.053
          <i>Ciao, bella.</i>          

13:09.120 --> 13:11.288
This kitten                     
is smitten.                     

13:11.356 --> 13:13.958
         I found Salem          
    a date for the reunion.     

13:14.026 --> 13:15.325
    Way to go, honey.           

13:15.393 --> 13:17.495
                  You didn't pay
                anyone, did you?

13:17.562 --> 13:19.964
Hey, she can spend her allowance
    any way that she likes.     

13:20.031 --> 13:22.466
Let's get this business license 
        in the toaster.         

13:22.534 --> 13:24.868
        (ticking)               

13:24.936 --> 13:25.903
          What's that?          

13:25.971 --> 13:27.771
  We spent the day in a clock   

13:27.839 --> 13:30.408
        and we developed        
    a low-grade tick.           

13:30.475 --> 13:32.143
Okay, I'm just                  
going to nod                    

13:32.210 --> 13:34.344
and pretend to understand.      

13:37.015 --> 13:38.282
          Okay, close your eyes.

13:39.284 --> 13:41.051
        Thanks, Sabrina.        

13:41.119 --> 13:44.021
Wait till that rotten Billy Luto
 sees me walk into that reunion 

13:44.088 --> 13:45.957
 with the prom queen on my arm. 

13:46.024 --> 13:48.459
      Juliette, <i>mi amour.</i>       

13:48.526 --> 13:49.860
                        Open up.

13:49.928 --> 13:51.595
         Mmm, yum, yum.         

13:51.662 --> 13:54.966
 So, just out of curiosity, why 
was Juliette turned into a cat? 

13:55.033 --> 13:56.366
          I only tried          
    to take over the world.     

13:56.434 --> 13:58.902
     She tried to take over     
         the universe.          

13:58.971 --> 14:00.571
        Man, is she hot.        

14:00.638 --> 14:02.406
    (thunder and lightning)     

14:04.575 --> 14:06.944
        Mr. Saberhagen,         

14:07.011 --> 14:08.412
        your limo awaits        

14:08.480 --> 14:10.847
and, yes, you have to tip.      

14:10.916 --> 14:14.251
     You should know I plan     
  to play the radio very loud.  

14:14.319 --> 14:15.486
Thanks for bringing me Juliette.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.187
          I'm in love.          

14:20.391 --> 14:21.759
    (thunder and lightning)     

14:21.827 --> 14:23.961
     They grow up so fast.      

14:28.433 --> 14:30.434
Sabrina, I'm glad               
I found you.                    

14:30.502 --> 14:32.202
Sore throat postponed.          

14:32.270 --> 14:34.972
    Apparently, he has a...     
          sore throat.          

14:35.040 --> 14:36.740
    Dang. Done in by irony.     

14:36.808 --> 14:38.575
I got to go-- he asked me       
     to leave some lozenges     

14:38.643 --> 14:40.911
      in a brown paper bag      
    on a bench in the park.     

14:42.146 --> 14:44.147
            Hey, Dreama, what   
             are you doing here?

14:44.149 --> 14:45.449
I joined a club,                

14:45.517 --> 14:48.318
but it's only full              
of parents and teachers.        

14:48.386 --> 14:50.187
                 Yeah, the PTA's
                 funny that way.

14:50.255 --> 14:52.489
         So was Juliette excited
     about going to the reunion?

14:52.557 --> 14:54.558
Oh, yeah. She said she can't    
wait to run into this guy       

14:54.626 --> 14:56.360
that she had a huge crush on    
in high school.                 

14:56.428 --> 14:58.328
                So she didn't go
        because she likes Salem?

14:58.396 --> 15:00.531
She likes that                  
he's giving her a ride.         

15:00.598 --> 15:01.932
                     Poor Salem.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.167
So basically, the girl          
you picked for Salem            

15:04.235 --> 15:05.369
              is just using him.

15:05.437 --> 15:07.438
That's one way to put it.       

15:07.505 --> 15:09.106
          Why didn't you tell me
          Juliette was so awful?

15:09.174 --> 15:10.740
You met her.                    

15:10.808 --> 15:12.109
                All right, let's
                  not overreact.

15:12.177 --> 15:13.477
             Salem will survive.

15:13.545 --> 15:15.812
    He'll see the potato bar,   
        and all will be well.   

15:15.880 --> 15:17.648
              Sure, he's thought
        he was in love before   

15:17.715 --> 15:18.915
                and not just    
                with himself.   

15:18.983 --> 15:21.285
        (phone ringing)         

15:21.353 --> 15:22.686
                    Hello.      

15:22.753 --> 15:24.888
                I'm calling from
            Other Realm Vegas   

15:24.956 --> 15:27.090
          about Mr. Saberhagen's
                        wedding.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.859
              No!               

15:28.927 --> 15:31.095
         Salem's going          
    to propose to Juliette.     

15:31.163 --> 15:34.031
Okay, no matter what food       
they serve there, I think       
he's going to be crushed.       

15:34.098 --> 15:36.867
          Poor Salem, he's going
            to humiliate himself
                more than usual.

15:36.934 --> 15:38.102
                 Well, we've got
                    to stop him.

15:38.169 --> 15:39.869
But if we don't                 
get there in time,              

15:39.937 --> 15:41.805
            I think             
  we should all blame Dreama.   

15:46.377 --> 15:47.678
        (ticking)               

15:47.745 --> 15:49.179
        What's going on?        

15:49.247 --> 15:50.147
        Security.               

15:50.215 --> 15:51.448
      What's that ticking?      

15:51.516 --> 15:53.350
                    Her.        

15:53.418 --> 15:54.652
  Look, either you're strapped  

15:54.719 --> 15:56.119
         with some kind         
      of explosive device       

15:56.187 --> 15:57.521
or you're just ticked off.      

15:57.589 --> 15:59.389
Either way,                     
I can't let you through.        

15:59.457 --> 16:01.158
             It's not like we're
             flying to Israel.  

16:02.393 --> 16:04.195
Well, you two go.               
Salem can't wait.               

16:04.262 --> 16:06.897
    (thunder and lightning)     

16:06.965 --> 16:08.399
                  I'm guessing a
                  hijacking joke

16:08.466 --> 16:09.966
                     wouldn't be
                funny to you.   

16:10.034 --> 16:12.036
     (dance music playing)      

16:20.512 --> 16:22.546
        Wow.                    

16:22.614 --> 16:24.314
     Is that Becky Barnes?      

16:24.382 --> 16:26.984
She's lost                      
a lot of weight.                

16:27.051 --> 16:28.152
                    That jerk...
                he's not coming.

16:28.219 --> 16:29.619
Oh, are you looking             
for the waiter?                 

16:29.687 --> 16:30.788
I'll get him.                   

16:30.856 --> 16:32.189
                 Uh, no, thanks.

16:32.257 --> 16:33.691
      If I need something,      
     I'll make <i>you</i> get it.      

16:33.758 --> 16:35.492
    I love your fire.           

16:35.560 --> 16:39.930
  Juliette, there's something   
  I've been dying to ask you.   

16:39.997 --> 16:41.431
(clearing throat)               

16:41.499 --> 16:44.034
I feel when life hands you      
      something wonderful       

16:44.102 --> 16:45.402
      you should grab it.       

16:45.470 --> 16:46.971
     Hey, you're not going      
     to touch me, are you?      

16:47.038 --> 16:49.406
      Okay, here it goes.       

16:49.474 --> 16:52.008
     Juliette, will you...?     

16:52.076 --> 16:53.977
     Salem, there you are.      
I thought I might find you here.

16:54.045 --> 16:54.912
We need to talk.                

16:54.979 --> 16:57.014
     Let me start. Go away.     

16:57.081 --> 16:58.015
              Come on, Juliette.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.384
             You have cat litter
             on your back paws. 

17:00.451 --> 17:02.153
                Oh, white fur   
            shows everything.   

17:03.388 --> 17:06.656
Sabrina,                        
this night rocks.               

17:06.723 --> 17:08.558
We sipped champagne in the limo.

17:08.626 --> 17:10.394
    Salem, there's something    
      I need to tell you.       

17:10.461 --> 17:11.694
We tangoed cheek to cheek.      

17:11.762 --> 17:13.430
This may be hard to say, but... 

17:13.498 --> 17:15.733
        Cats can tango?         
         Wait a minute.         

17:15.800 --> 17:17.401
        Salem, Juliette         
    only came with you          

17:17.469 --> 17:19.369
so she could see some other guy.

17:19.436 --> 17:21.037
          Her brother?          

17:21.105 --> 17:23.741
So if there was a question      
you were going to... pop,       

17:23.809 --> 17:26.309
you might want to save it       
    for another girl.           

17:26.377 --> 17:27.944
I only have                     
one question.                   

17:28.012 --> 17:30.581
How could I be so stupid?       

17:30.648 --> 17:32.148
             Oh...              

17:32.216 --> 17:33.651
             Come on, Salem, let
            me take you home.   

17:33.718 --> 17:35.152
  We can stop by the potato bar.

17:35.219 --> 17:37.887
        Real bacon bits         
     might help me forget.      

17:37.955 --> 17:40.023
            Salem Saberhagen.   

17:40.091 --> 17:41.425
Yeah? Billy Luto.               

17:41.492 --> 17:45.129
          Well, look who's doing
        time in a kitty suit.   

17:45.196 --> 17:47.331
Did world domination plans      
         fall through?          

17:47.398 --> 17:48.598
        (laughing)              

17:48.666 --> 17:50.000
        (groaning)              
                  Do you want me

17:50.068 --> 17:51.869
to level the playing field      
and turn him into a mouse?      

17:51.936 --> 17:53.336
    A very slow mouse?          

17:53.404 --> 17:55.472
Thanks, but I can defend myself.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.539
I'm not                         
the high school nerd            

17:56.607 --> 17:58.008
         I used to be.          

17:58.076 --> 17:59.443
        Nice tux.               

17:59.510 --> 18:00.410
            Stop it!            

18:00.478 --> 18:02.179
So what have I been up to?      

18:02.246 --> 18:04.147
  Well, I'm rich, I'm married,  

18:04.215 --> 18:06.984
        and my bathroom         
     is not in the kitchen.     

18:07.051 --> 18:08.385
        I mean it, quit.        

18:08.453 --> 18:11.521
      Boy, I haven't given      
      a wedgie in decades.      

18:11.589 --> 18:12.589
              Huh?              

18:12.657 --> 18:13.790
     I hope you're wearing      
          little BVDs           

18:13.858 --> 18:15.892
     under that cummerbund.     

18:15.960 --> 18:17.027
     Hey, leave him alone!      

18:17.095 --> 18:18.628
                  At least Salem
                had real dreams.
Huh?                            

18:18.696 --> 18:21.098
Sure, they were bereft of ethics

18:21.166 --> 18:24.902
      or even a real plan,      
  but he had the guts to try.   

18:24.969 --> 18:25.836
                     This cat is
                more of a man   

18:25.904 --> 18:27.404
      than you'll ever be.      

18:27.438 --> 18:31.075
You're nothing but a big bully, 
          Bully Luto.           

18:32.209 --> 18:33.410
          Juliette...           

18:35.513 --> 18:36.580
          Cute couple.          

18:36.648 --> 18:39.582
        Maybe you'd like        
    a wedgie built for two?     

18:39.650 --> 18:41.851
  Okay, I'm done being brave.   

18:41.919 --> 18:43.253
Sabrina!                        

18:46.190 --> 18:49.326
    Look who's hanging          
      by their heenie now.      

18:49.394 --> 18:50.160
(chuckling)                     

18:50.228 --> 18:51.561
Thank you, Juliette.            

18:51.629 --> 18:53.797
      I knew you loved me.      

18:53.865 --> 18:55.932
  Love you? I don't love you.   

18:56.000 --> 18:57.300
                    I just can't
                      stand him.

18:57.368 --> 19:00.504
 I liked him all junior year--  
            nothing.            

19:00.571 --> 19:03.774
      And unrequited love       
        makes me cranky.        

19:03.842 --> 19:06.443
Come on, you liked me           
just a little.                  

19:06.511 --> 19:08.646
                  I wish I could
                roll my eyes.   

19:08.713 --> 19:11.281
Well, you liked me              
better than him.                

19:11.348 --> 19:13.216
      I like a canker sore      
        better than him.        

19:13.284 --> 19:14.652
              Yes!              

19:17.021 --> 19:18.856
                 Wow, apparently
                      these work

19:18.923 --> 19:20.891
             in the Other Realm.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.893
     (dance music playing)      

19:30.634 --> 19:32.569
      (crickets chirping)       

19:32.637 --> 19:34.638
  Thanks for meeting us here,   
          sore throat.          

19:34.706 --> 19:36.273
  Do you want to come closer?   

19:36.341 --> 19:39.209
No. I'm a little nervous        
about this whole thing.         

19:39.276 --> 19:41.245
Don't be. This is               
completely confidential,        

19:41.312 --> 19:44.881
except for what we publish      
in the paper.                   

19:44.949 --> 19:46.816
         Yeah, so just relax and
     tell us everything you know

19:46.884 --> 19:48.618
         and, remember, it's for
         the good of the school.

19:48.686 --> 19:49.619
All right.                      

19:49.687 --> 19:52.089
I keep seeing                   
strange things.                 

19:52.157 --> 19:54.191
This girl is                    
wearing one outfit,             

19:54.259 --> 19:57.527
  then suddenly, she's wearing  
      a different outfit.       

19:57.595 --> 19:59.796
          Okay, well, I think we
         got everything we need.

19:59.864 --> 20:01.398
The same girl                   
is on crutches                  

20:01.466 --> 20:02.866
  and the crutches disappear.   

20:02.934 --> 20:04.267
There's a talking cat,          

20:04.335 --> 20:06.569
        and, um...              

20:06.637 --> 20:08.805
    I can't take it anymore.    

20:10.408 --> 20:12.009
Do you know                     
what this means?                

20:12.076 --> 20:14.011
          Yup, no corroboration,
                    no story.   

20:14.078 --> 20:15.512
No, this is paranormal.         

20:15.580 --> 20:17.347
This is worthy                  
of network TV.                  

20:17.415 --> 20:18.849
This is <i>bigger</i>                  
 than meat.                     

20:18.917 --> 20:20.083
                      Oh, pshaw.

20:20.151 --> 20:22.119
             The kid's obviously
          starved for attention.

20:22.186 --> 20:23.687
Aren't we all?                  

20:23.755 --> 20:26.323
              And, besides, I've
              decided to go with
                 another story--

20:26.391 --> 20:27.858
              "Kinkle might make
                  first string."

20:27.926 --> 20:28.959
                      Got to go.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.294
              So, how did it go?

20:30.361 --> 20:32.663
                 Did sore throat
                    cough it up?

20:32.730 --> 20:33.697
He hocked something ugly up.    

20:33.765 --> 20:34.831
We got to get out of here.      

20:36.801 --> 20:37.801
              Aah!              

20:37.868 --> 20:39.803
          (screaming)           

20:45.676 --> 20:48.178
    So you never pinned anything
              on Mr. Kraft, huh?

20:48.179 --> 20:50.648
No, I can't believe he          
wasn't dirty dealing.           

20:50.715 --> 20:52.182
    No, now, come on,           
you're being unreasonable.      

20:52.250 --> 20:54.117
     We can work this out!      

20:54.185 --> 20:55.652
    Oh, no, not the settee!     

20:55.719 --> 20:57.521
        Where am I going        
    to take my naps?!           

20:57.588 --> 21:00.324
                     You told us
                 it was T-bones.
Yeah...                         

21:00.391 --> 21:03.360
            You never said it   
                was <i>school</i> meat.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.362
          (stammering)          

21:05.430 --> 21:07.664
            No. No.             

21:07.731 --> 21:09.666
            (grunts)
