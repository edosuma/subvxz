00:10.510 --> 00:12.970
Is Riley here?

00:15.098 --> 00:16.097
Red alert!

00:17.058 --> 00:23.480
Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy. Boy.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.815
There's a boy in my house.

00:24.899 --> 00:27.317
I knew she was going skating, but I
thought it was with her friends.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.694
Why is there a boy in my house?

00:28.778 --> 00:31.530
This isn't a date, is it?
I'll ask Riley.

00:32.949 --> 00:33.949
I don't like this.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.118
This can't be a date!
She's only 12!

00:36.202 --> 00:39.747
Let's probe, but layer it
with cool words the kids say,

00:39.831 --> 00:41.123
so it's not obvious.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.501
So, what's the dealio with Jordan?

00:44.586 --> 00:48.839
O- M-G, he is awesome-sauce
fo sheezy.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.800
Did she just say "fo sheezy"?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.844
I don't understand.
What's happening?

00:53.928 --> 00:56.972
This is just embarrassing.
I can't. I can't.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.182
Holla!

01:04.813 --> 01:06.294
I know what you're
doing here, Jordan.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.650
You don't think that I know what
you know, but I know, you little punk!

01:08.735 --> 01:10.736
He's not good enough for Riley.
No one is!

01:10.820 --> 01:12.071
Go back to jail!

01:12.155 --> 01:14.907
What are you looking for, Jordan?
Something to steal?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.575
- Like our daughter.
- Should we say something?

01:16.659 --> 01:18.368
No, no, no. He'll be expecting that.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.538
Give him the silent treatment.
He's about to crack, I can feel it.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.712
Whoa, dude! Awesome!

01:31.341 --> 01:33.842
Sir, no response.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.221
Two can play at your mind games,
Jordan. Intimidate!

01:43.436 --> 01:45.771
Dude, what's he looking at?

01:45.855 --> 01:47.856
Probably your dumb hat.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.573
Sir, intimidation is failing.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.659
Increase the pressure. Engage.

01:58.993 --> 02:03.330
So, Jordan,
what do you like to do for fun?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.833
I don't know. Stuff.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.376
Sir, that sounds like backtalk.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.963
That's it! He's outta here!
Give him the boot.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.464
Yes, sir. Launching boot.

02:19.013 --> 02:22.558
On my mark.
In five, four, three...

02:24.102 --> 02:26.562
I play in a band. That's fun.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.439
Wait. We were in a band.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.407
I was in a band, lead guitar.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.909
Cool. I rock the bass.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.621
- We played a lot of AC/DC.
- Yeah, my favorite band is AC/DC.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.706
What.

02:46.082 --> 02:48.125
Mom, it's not a date.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.127
We're going skating
with a group of friends.

02:50.211 --> 02:53.172
Oh, fun. That'll be off the hook. L-O-L.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.381
Stop talking like that!

02:54.465 --> 02:55.465
Wait. Where's Jordan?

02:55.758 --> 02:57.509
Did you leave Jordan with Dad?

02:57.594 --> 02:58.760
Mom! This is so embarrassing.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.431
Riley, your father
would never do any...

03:05.685 --> 03:06.685
Yeah!

03:08.938 --> 03:09.938
Awesome.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.149
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

03:12.275 --> 03:14.109
- Have fun.
- Peace out, my homies.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.112
You know, Jordan's a good kid.

03:17.238 --> 03:18.864
You're not so bad yourself.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.033
Sir, the wife has initiated contact.
What do we do?

03:21.534 --> 03:24.203
This is our chance.
Give her the look.

03:28.875 --> 03:31.001
He's making that
stupid face again.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.127
Should we smack him?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.713
Come on. He's adorable.

03:36.507 --> 03:37.799
There's the signal.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.468
We are go. Repeat, we are go.

03:39.594 --> 03:43.347
Contact in five, four, three, two...

04:27.141 --> 04:28.517
I'm good. You guys good?

04:28.601 --> 04:29.726
- Yeah. I'm good.
- Yeah, I'm good here.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.770
Good.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.647
Okay, that's enough.

04:34.357 --> 04:38.360
Yeah. I'll go fix the table.
