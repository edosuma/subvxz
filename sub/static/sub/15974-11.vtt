44:52.658 --> 44:54.490
<i>Dan: We really got nine
hockey segments tonight?</i>

44:54.559 --> 44:57.028
<i>Casey: Three shootouts, two penalty
shots, Stefan LeCourier...</i>

44:57.095 --> 44:59.427
-- <i>Jerome will be happy.</i>
-- <i>Who's Jerome?</i>

44:59.498 --> 45:00.829
-- Jerome.
-- Right.

45:00.899 --> 45:02.628
-- He'll be happy.
-- Yeah.

45:02.701 --> 45:03.827
-- Sure.
-- Who is he?

45:03.902 --> 45:05.461
-- Jerome?
-- Right.

45:05.537 --> 45:06.800
I'm talking about Jerome.

45:06.872 --> 45:08.966
You can say his name
as many times as you like.

45:09.041 --> 45:10.668
I'm still not gonna
know who he is.

45:10.742 --> 45:12.039
-- Camera two.
-- What about it?

45:12.110 --> 45:13.600
He's the camera operator.

45:13.679 --> 45:14.669
Who?

45:14.746 --> 45:17.010
Are you prepared to do
a broadcast right now?

45:17.082 --> 45:18.709
Yeah.

45:18.784 --> 45:21.344
The camera guy.

45:21.420 --> 45:22.683
What about him?

45:22.754 --> 45:24.222
Is Jerome.

45:24.289 --> 45:26.383
Jerome is the camera
operator on number two.

45:26.458 --> 45:27.948
[Snaps fingers]
And he likes hockey.

45:28.026 --> 45:29.323
Now you're with it.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.123
<i>Will: 60 seconds to VTR,</i>

45:31.196 --> 45:32.129
<i>two minutes live.</i>

45:32.197 --> 45:33.722
All right, here's a change.

45:33.799 --> 45:36.825
We're flip-flopping the Virginia Slims
quarterfinals and the IOC meeting.

45:36.902 --> 45:38.392
-- Kill <i>23.</i>
-- <i>I never had 23.</i>

45:38.470 --> 45:40.097
Then you won't miss it much.

45:40.172 --> 45:41.936
Jeremy, tell me what's
happening in Chattanooga.

45:42.007 --> 45:44.032
Tell me quickly. Tell me
succinctly -- bullet points.

45:44.109 --> 45:46.373
[Snaps fingers] We're on the
air in less than two minutes,

45:46.445 --> 45:47.913
so don't give me
a Valedictory address.

45:47.980 --> 45:50.108
Talk to me as if
I'm a small child.

45:50.182 --> 45:52.583
Tell me what's happening
in Chattanooga.

45:52.651 --> 45:54.642
I don't know what's
happening in Chattanooga.

45:54.720 --> 45:57.553
Okay, tell me
a little more than that.

45:57.622 --> 45:59.522
I think, as a
New Year's resolution,

45:59.591 --> 46:02.322
you should re-dedicate yourself
to the idea that this is a team.

46:02.394 --> 46:04.556
You play for a team --
a team with many players.

46:04.629 --> 46:06.757
-- And you think I should learn their
names. -- <i>I</i> think it'd be nice.

46:06.832 --> 46:09.028
-- I agree. -- See, a team's made
<i>up</i> of a <i>group</i> of individuals...

46:09.101 --> 46:11.035
-- <i>You're gonna keep talking anyway?</i>
-- <i>Individuals who forsake</i>

46:11.103 --> 46:13.538
their own individual needs
to pursue a common goal --

46:13.605 --> 46:15.039
the team goal.

46:15.107 --> 46:17.235
In our case, the goal is a nightly
national television show.

46:17.309 --> 46:19.243
I'm saying I know
the guy's name now.

46:19.311 --> 46:21.211
<i>Will: Roll VTR.
60 seconds, live.</i>

46:21.279 --> 46:23.577
Show me Tokyo.
Show me the Chyron on 4.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.377
-- 4 is up.
-- You've got Tokyo.

46:25.450 --> 46:26.781
That was Brian
in Chattanooga.

46:26.852 --> 46:28.547
All right, tell me what he
knows -- bullet points.

46:28.620 --> 46:30.611
I can feed it right to Casey
and put it in the tease.

46:30.689 --> 46:33.056
Casey, stand by, I'm gonna fill the tease.
What does he know?

46:33.125 --> 46:35.856
-- He doesn't know anything.
-- Stop standing by, Casey.

46:35.927 --> 46:37.019
What's going on?

46:37.095 --> 46:38.529
<i>There was an incident
at Tennessee Western</i>

46:38.597 --> 46:41.032
involving some black athletes
and a Confederate flag.

46:41.099 --> 46:43.090
-- What happened?
-- We <i>don't know.</i>

46:43.168 --> 46:45.034
<i>Dave." In 3...2...</i>

46:45.103 --> 46:47.197
Good evening.
From New York City,

46:47.272 --> 46:49.764
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell.

46:49.841 --> 46:52.276
Those stories, plus we'll
head out to the Hoosier Dome

46:52.344 --> 46:54.836
where Bobby Knight's done a
little interior decorating,

46:54.913 --> 46:56.506
and we'll leave room
for more hockey

46:56.581 --> 46:58.140
than you can shake
a big stick at.

46:58.216 --> 47:00.844
We'll bring you the thrill of
victory and the agony of defeat

47:00.919 --> 47:03.217
and, because we've got
soccer highlights,

47:03.288 --> 47:06.258
the sheer pointlessness
of a zero-zero tie.

47:06.324 --> 47:08.622
You're watching “Sports Night“
on CSC, so stick around.

47:08.693 --> 47:10.161
<i>We're out.</i>

47:10.228 --> 47:11.320
Back in 60.

47:11.396 --> 47:13.296
What's going on
in Chattanooga?

47:13.365 --> 47:14.332
We don't know.

47:14.399 --> 47:16.060
-- We don't know?
-- We don't know.

47:16.134 --> 47:18.466
-- We don't know anything?
-- We don't know much.

47:18.537 --> 47:21.097
But, fundamentally, we're still a
news-gathering organization, right?

47:21.173 --> 47:22.163
Sure.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.265
-- Then what's the problem?
-- We're not very good.

47:24.342 --> 47:26.640
That's what I thought.

47:30.682 --> 47:32.411
Comin' back on Dan
in 3...2...

47:32.484 --> 47:35.010
<i>Woman: Dan, Casey,
back to you in the studio.</i>

47:35.087 --> 47:37.351
Thank you, Kelly Kirkpatrick,
in Green Bay.

47:37.422 --> 47:39.356
You look cold.
Put some clothes on.

47:39.424 --> 47:41.324
Hey, folks, look outside.

47:41.393 --> 47:42.758
Tinsel, mistletoe...

47:42.828 --> 47:44.922
It can only mean
one thing.

47:44.996 --> 47:46.020
Casey.

47:46.098 --> 47:47.691
<i>Play of the year.</i>

47:47.766 --> 47:49.359
<i>Play 0' the year.</i>

47:49.434 --> 47:52.028
Our crack staff has been
debating the subject,

47:52.104 --> 47:54.004
and we'll bring you our
choice on New Year's Eve,

47:54.072 --> 47:55.130
but we want to hear from you,

47:55.207 --> 47:56.675
so if you've
got a play of the year,

47:56.741 --> 48:00.177
you can contact us at
CSC/sportsnighLcom,

48:00.245 --> 48:03.271
or just go on over to Casey's apartment
and knock on the door anytime.

48:03.348 --> 48:05.680
That's all for us. You've been
watching “Sports Night“ on CSC.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.047
We'll see you tomorrow.

48:07.119 --> 48:08.109
Good night.

48:08.186 --> 48:09.347
-- Music.
-- Go.

48:09.421 --> 48:10.582
-- Animation.
-- Go.

48:10.655 --> 48:12.623
And we're out.

48:12.691 --> 48:15.160
<i>Camera wrap -- 12:06.</i>

48:15.227 --> 48:18.288
<i>So, what are you planning on
cooking tomorrow morning?</i>

48:18.363 --> 48:20.525
I'm not cooking.
It's not a cooking show.

48:20.599 --> 48:21.964
-- Are you sure?
-- It's a news show.

48:22.033 --> 48:23.501
-- "The View"?
-- Yeah.

48:23.568 --> 48:25.627
The one with Barbara VValters
and the four women who cook?

48:25.704 --> 48:27.263
They don't cook.
It's a news show.

48:27.339 --> 48:29.000
-- Who are the other guests? --
It's just me and another guy.

48:29.074 --> 48:31.202
-- Who's the other guy? -- You're
havin' a good time, aren't you?

48:31.276 --> 48:33.870
-- Who's the other <i>guy?</i> -- It's
Wolfgang Puck! You want a piece of me?

48:33.945 --> 48:35.413
No, but thanks.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.915
You know, it wouldn't kill you to
go out there and do a little press.

48:37.983 --> 48:39.212
I've been grounded,
remember?

48:39.284 --> 48:41.218
How long's the network
got you in the penalty box?

48:41.286 --> 48:42.754
No public statements
for six months.

48:42.821 --> 48:44.380
-- You want me to talk to somebody?
-- No.

48:44.456 --> 48:45.582
-- I can.
-- I'm perfectly happy

48:45.657 --> 48:47.989
just doing my job
and keeping my mouth shut.

48:48.059 --> 48:49.857
I don't need
to give interviews.

48:49.928 --> 48:51.362
I don't even want to
give interviews.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.227
I'm happy for the chance
to not give interviews.

48:53.298 --> 48:55.232
-- You don't want me to talk to 'em?
-- No.

48:55.300 --> 48:56.893
-- Okay.
-- Talk to 'em.

48:56.968 --> 48:59.403
-- Danny... -- I need to give interviews.
I like to give interviews.

48:59.471 --> 49:02.406
It's the only chance I get to talk
to a huge group of total strangers.

49:02.474 --> 49:04.670
-- Except for that hour every night
you're on television. -- That's right.

49:04.743 --> 49:06.074
-- I'll talk to 'em.
Dana: Hey.

49:06.144 --> 49:08.169
-- Knock 'em dead on the cooking
show tomorrow. -- Thank you.

49:08.246 --> 49:09.236
[Laughs]

49:09.314 --> 49:11.305
[Cheers and applause]

49:13.518 --> 49:14.952
And welcome back
to "The View."

49:15.020 --> 49:16.545
We are talking with
Casey McCall,

49:16.621 --> 49:17.952
<i>co-host of "Sports Night,"</i>

49:18.023 --> 49:21.118
which can be seen every night
at 11:00 P.M. on CSC.

49:21.193 --> 49:23.890
Yes, with my partner, Dan Rydell,
who couldn't be here this morning.

49:23.962 --> 49:25.327
Hope he has a good excuse.

49:25.397 --> 49:28.162
-- Yes, uh, he likes to sleep late.
-- Good enough.

49:28.233 --> 49:31.100
Before we went to commercial, you were
saying that you and, uh, Dan write together.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.136
<i>Yes.</i>

49:32.204 --> 49:33.330
How does that work?

49:33.405 --> 49:34.895
Well, I take
the nouns and verbs.

49:34.973 --> 49:36.771
Danny handles the adjectives
and prepositions,

49:36.841 --> 49:39.310
and, uh, anything with
an umlaut, we toss a coin.

49:39.377 --> 49:41.209
<i>Now, Casey, you know
we can't let you go</i>

49:41.279 --> 49:42.940
without asking you
about those ties.

49:43.014 --> 49:44.914
Ah, the ties.

49:44.983 --> 49:46.576
<i>The famous neckties.</i>

49:46.651 --> 49:48.551
<i>Now, listen up, ladies.
You're single, right?</i>

49:48.620 --> 49:51.089
-- Yes, I'm recently divorced. --
I/VeH, <i>I</i> think you should know

49:51.156 --> 49:54.182
that a man who knows how to dress
himself is a very sexy thing.

49:54.259 --> 49:57.092
Which is why so many of
us are drawn to Carrot Top.

49:57.162 --> 49:58.527
<i>Debbie: Absolutely.</i>

49:58.597 --> 50:00.224
<i>All right, if you're
a sports fan</i>

50:00.298 --> 50:02.733
or just like neckties,
don't miss "Sports Night"

50:02.801 --> 50:05.065
with Dan Rydell and our
guest, Casey McCall,

50:05.136 --> 50:07.298
every night at 11:00 on CSC.

50:07.372 --> 50:09.101
We'll be right back
after this.

50:09.174 --> 50:12.269
[Cheers and applause] Thank you.
Thank you very much.

50:17.382 --> 50:19.646
<i>By the way, in the memos
that are circulating,</i>

50:19.718 --> 50:22.187
we're spelling Chattanooga
about 14 different ways.

50:22.254 --> 50:23.346
Now what do we know?

50:23.421 --> 50:24.820
Two O's, three A's.

50:24.889 --> 50:26.880
-- <i>That's it?</i> -- <i>No, there
are other letters, too.</i>

50:27.892 --> 50:30.827
-- But surely that's not
what you meant. -- No.

50:30.895 --> 50:32.385
Roland Shepard is a tailback

50:32.464 --> 50:34.796
from a small town in western
Tennessee called Tipolo --

50:34.866 --> 50:35.992
one one

50:36.067 --> 50:37.535
He rode the bench
for two years,

50:37.602 --> 50:39.661
and then two weeks ago,
he won the starting job

50:39.738 --> 50:41.706
<i>when Lfffias went down
with</i> a <i>torn AOL.</i>

50:41.773 --> 50:44.208
He rushed for 218 yards
in his first game,

50:44.276 --> 50:46.040
<i>273 yards in his second.</i>

50:46.111 --> 50:48.273
<i>That Z-game total's a
conference record, by the way.</i>

50:48.346 --> 50:50.280
<i>He scored four touchdowns
on the ground,</i>

50:50.348 --> 50:53.045
two of them against the third-ranked
rushing defense in the nation.

50:53.118 --> 50:54.415
He also caught a pass
for a touchdown

50:54.486 --> 50:56.011
and ran a punt back
for a touchdown.

50:56.087 --> 50:58.886
He's carrying a 3.3 GPA with a
major in chemical engineering,

50:58.957 --> 51:01.892
and the engineering department at
Tennessee VVestern is for real.

51:01.960 --> 51:03.724
-- <i>So what's</i> going <i>on?</i> -- <i>They're
gonna kick him out of school.</i>

51:03.795 --> 51:05.786
They're threatening to
kick him out of school.

51:05.864 --> 51:07.298
-- The Confederate flag?
-- Yeah.

51:07.365 --> 51:09.197
They fly the flag
outside the stadium?

51:09.267 --> 51:11.395
-- Yeah. -- <i>Also, students
wave 'em in the stands.</i>

51:11.469 --> 51:13.164
Nothing you can do
about that.

51:13.238 --> 51:15.206
Yeah, but outside the
stadium, that's the school.

51:15.273 --> 51:17.002
<i>Anyway, there'll be
a press conference at 3:00.</i>

51:17.075 --> 51:18.736
We have it on satellite.

51:18.810 --> 51:21.643
The rumor is Roland won't play unless
the school takes the flag down.

51:21.713 --> 51:24.546
<i>The school's gonna announce that
Roland is suspended from the team,</i>

51:24.616 --> 51:26.710
as a result of which his
scholarship will be revoked,

51:26.785 --> 51:28.446
as a result of which
Roland will go back

51:28.520 --> 51:30.989
and pump gas
in Tipolo, Tennessee.

51:31.056 --> 51:33.821
Dan, be on
the press conference.

51:33.892 --> 51:37.226
<i>Meantime, I need to hear some plays
of the year by the end of the day.</i>

51:37.295 --> 51:38.353
Thank you.

51:38.430 --> 51:40.159
Back here at 6:00.

51:40.231 --> 51:41.960
Danny, I need
to talk to you.

51:42.033 --> 51:44.934
Good, 'cause I need to talk to you, too.
Who should go first?

51:45.003 --> 51:48.564
Since I don't really care what you
have to say, I think it should be me.

51:48.640 --> 51:49.766
Fair enough.

51:49.841 --> 51:51.707
Luther Sachs has taken
a special interest

51:51.776 --> 51:53.403
in that situation in
Chattanooga.

51:53.478 --> 51:56.277
-- He's an alumnus. -- He's got a
couple of buildings named after him.

51:56.348 --> 51:58.715
-- Yeah, he's a hell of a guy.
-- He's a Southerner.

51:58.783 --> 51:59.978
Luther Sachs is German.

52:00.051 --> 52:01.883
He's a Southerner
for three generations.

52:01.953 --> 52:03.114
Faulkner was a Southerner.

52:03.188 --> 52:04.815
Faulkner was
a Southern gentleman.

52:04.889 --> 52:06.152
There's a difference?

52:06.224 --> 52:08.022
The difference, Danny,
is all the difference.

52:08.093 --> 52:09.925
So, what does Luther want?

52:09.994 --> 52:11.826
A piece on
Southern gentlemen,

52:11.896 --> 52:13.295
the Southern tradition --

52:13.365 --> 52:15.390
the Southern tradition
in sports,

52:15.467 --> 52:16.935
in culture, in history.

52:17.001 --> 52:20.027
-- All symbolized by the Confederate flag.
-- You learn <i>fast.</i>

52:20.105 --> 52:21.436
-- <i>You really want to do this?</i>
-- <i>No.</i>

52:21.506 --> 52:23.531
-- <i>Then don't.</i>
-- <i>There are days, Danny,</i>

52:23.608 --> 52:26.100
-- when I'm just too tired to fight
that man. -- You gotta let <i>us</i> know

52:26.177 --> 52:27.702
when it's one of those days,
and we'll fight him for you.

52:27.779 --> 52:29.543
You gotta stop
thinking of me

52:29.614 --> 52:31.981
as the champion
of all things black.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.720
Now, listen up, ladies.
You're single, right?

52:39.791 --> 52:42.089
-- Yes, I'm recently divorced. --
I/VeH, <i>I</i> think you should know

52:42.160 --> 52:45.186
that a man who knows how to dress
himself is a very sexy thing.

52:45.263 --> 52:47.425
<i>Which is why so many of
us are drawn to Carrot Top.</i>

52:47.499 --> 52:49.092
<i>Debbie: Absolutely.</i>

52:49.167 --> 52:51.135
<i>[Knock on door] AH right, if
you're</i> a <i>sports fan or</i> --

52:51.202 --> 52:53.102
-- Excuse me, Mr. McCall?
-- Yeah?

52:53.171 --> 52:55.196
I'm sorry.
Is this a bad time?

52:55.273 --> 52:56.968
-- <i>For</i> what? -- <i>I'd like
to ask you</i> a <i>question,</i>

52:57.041 --> 52:58.440
but if you're preparing
the show,

52:58.510 --> 53:00.444
if this is a bad time,
I can -- I can come back.

53:00.512 --> 53:01.673
What's your question?

53:03.348 --> 53:07.148
Well, uh...
what's my name?

53:07.218 --> 53:09.186
What's your name?

53:09.254 --> 53:10.517
Yes.

53:10.588 --> 53:12.488
Um...

53:12.557 --> 53:14.047
what are we doing
right now?

53:14.125 --> 53:16.184
If this is a bad time,
I can just come --

53:16.261 --> 53:18.787
I'm sorry. I'm not very
good at remembering names.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.331
<i>Who was the number-two man</i>

53:20.398 --> 53:24.130
on the Boston Red Sox
staff in 1977?

53:24.202 --> 53:27.194
It was Ferguson Jenkins.

53:29.474 --> 53:30.999
My name is Monica.

53:31.075 --> 53:34.101
I'm the assistant wardrobe
supervisor for “Sports Night“

53:34.179 --> 53:36.238
as well as two other
shows here at CSC.

53:36.314 --> 53:39.249
I think you hurt the feelings
of the woman I work for.

53:39.317 --> 53:41.479
Her name is Maureen,

53:41.553 --> 53:44.079
and she's been working here
since the day you started.

53:46.658 --> 53:48.092
Well, I know Maureen.

53:48.159 --> 53:49.593
Can I ask you
a-another question?

53:49.694 --> 53:51.685
I'm sorry I didn't
know your name.

53:51.729 --> 53:55.688
-- Do you know what color this is?
-- I/VeH, <i>it's</i> gray.

53:55.767 --> 53:56.996
It's called gunmetal.

53:57.068 --> 53:59.935
Gray has more ivory in it.
Gunmetal has more blue.

54:00.004 --> 54:03.668
Can you tell me which of these
shirts you should wear it with?

54:03.741 --> 54:05.766
[Chuckles]
I-| don't know.

54:05.844 --> 54:07.471
No, you don't.

54:07.545 --> 54:09.377
There's no reason
why you should.

54:09.447 --> 54:12.849
You're not expected to know
what shirt goes with what suit

54:12.917 --> 54:15.943
or how a color in a necktie
can pick up your eyes.

54:16.020 --> 54:17.579
You're not expected to
know what --

54:17.655 --> 54:19.555
what's gonna clash
with what Dan's wearing

54:19.624 --> 54:23.219
or what pattern's gonna bleed
when Dave changes the lighting.

54:23.294 --> 54:26.662
Mr. McCall, you get so much
attention and so much praise

54:26.731 --> 54:29.723
for what you actually do,
and all of it's deserved.

54:31.636 --> 54:35.436
When you go on a talk show and get
complimented on something you didn't,

54:35.507 --> 54:37.874
how hard would it be
to say, "That's not me.

54:37.942 --> 54:41.936
“That's a woman named Maureen who's been
working for us since the first day.

54:42.013 --> 54:44.812
"It's Maureen who
dresses me every night,

54:44.883 --> 54:48.581
and without Maureen, I wouldn't know
gunmetal from a hole in the ground“?

54:51.289 --> 54:55.487
Do you have any idea what
that would've meant to her?

54:55.560 --> 54:58.530
[Sighs] Do you have any
idea how many times

54:58.596 --> 55:03.625
she would've played that tape
for her husband and her kids?

55:03.701 --> 55:05.760
I know --

55:05.837 --> 55:09.603
I know this is when it
starts to get busy for you.

55:09.674 --> 55:12.974
I hope I didn't take up
too much of your time.

55:13.044 --> 55:14.136
<i>[ Exhales deeply]</i>

55:14.212 --> 55:16.772
<i>Please don't tell
Maureen I spoke to you.</i>

55:16.848 --> 55:18.577
She'd be pretty mad at me.

55:18.650 --> 55:21.745
I won't...Monica.

55:26.190 --> 55:27.624
<i>Elliott: We need a plan.</i>

55:27.692 --> 55:29.558
-- <i>We definitely need</i> a <i>plan.</i>
-- <i>We need</i> a <i>plan.</i>

55:29.627 --> 55:31.618
Here's what we're gonna do --
we're gonna make a list

55:31.696 --> 55:34.165
of all the sports moments that
are potential plays of the year.

55:34.232 --> 55:35.290
Then we're gonna
list the pros,

55:35.366 --> 55:36.629
and then we're gonna
list the "cons."

55:36.701 --> 55:37.964
Why do women like
making lists?

55:38.036 --> 55:39.868
-- Women don't like making lists.
-- Yes, they do.

55:39.938 --> 55:42.566
They're never quite so happy as when
they're making themselves a little list.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.039
You ever think about
why you make lists?

55:44.108 --> 55:45.576
It's so I can
cross things off it.

55:45.643 --> 55:48.010
You ever think about why you've
got so much crap in your wallet?

55:48.079 --> 55:49.547
I save my receipts.

55:49.647 --> 55:51.308
You save fortunes
from Chinese restaurants.

55:51.349 --> 55:53.044
-- [Clears throat] Can we work now?
-- VVell, I think we should.

55:53.117 --> 55:55.449
But Natalie's gonna want to
list the pros and the cons.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.648
-- <i>Women's ice hockey.</i>
-- <i>You're kidding.</i>

55:57.722 --> 56:00.623
The U.S. women's team won the first
Olympic gold medal in ice hockey,

56:00.692 --> 56:02.626
<i>and there were over 4,000 fans
in the arena to see them do it.</i>

56:02.694 --> 56:05.493
<i>They beat a bunch of Slovakian
cocktail waitresses,</i>

56:05.563 --> 56:08.897
and there were over 4,000 people
at my cousin Jacob's bar mitzvah.

56:08.967 --> 56:10.435
[Laughs]
What do you got?

56:10.501 --> 56:11.662
Mark McGwire hits 70.

56:11.736 --> 56:13.397
It's a little obvious.

56:13.471 --> 56:15.439
Our goal isn't to be
cunning, is it?

56:15.506 --> 56:17.770
Can we keep this organized?
Pros and cons.

56:17.842 --> 56:20.334
Well, the pro is he broke
an unbreakable record,

56:20.411 --> 56:23.506
and the con is Kim likes
women's ice hockey.

56:23.581 --> 56:25.242
-- What's next? -- <i>Jeff</i> Gordon.
-- No.

56:25.316 --> 56:27.580
-- Why? -- 'Cause it's NASCAR,
and who gives a damn?

56:27.652 --> 56:30.178
-- <i>Who gives</i> a damn? -- <i>How
many people give</i> a <i>good damn?</i>

56:30.254 --> 56:32.518
Well, it's the world's
most popular sport,

56:32.590 --> 56:34.558
so probably more than 4,000.

56:34.626 --> 56:35.923
-- Next.
-- All right.

56:35.994 --> 56:37.894
Austrian skier Herman Maier.

56:37.962 --> 56:40.329
-- <i>Pros.</i> -- <i>He got up from one
of the most horrific accidents</i>

56:40.398 --> 56:42.765
in Olympic history and won the
gold medal two days later.

56:42.834 --> 56:44.893
-- Cons.
-- <i>It's downhill skiing.</i>

56:44.969 --> 56:47.131
-- <i>And?</i>
-- <i>Who gives</i> a <i>damn?</i>

56:51.542 --> 56:54.603
<i>It was very important to
my parents and to their parents</i>

56:54.679 --> 56:57.205
that I be the first in
my family to attend college.

56:57.281 --> 56:58.771
<i>But I can't imagine
that any of them</i>

56:58.850 --> 57:01.342
<i>would feel anything
but shame and humiliation</i>

57:01.419 --> 57:04.116
at the sight of me playing
football under that flag.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.156
<i>I wish no disrespect
to my school,</i>

57:06.224 --> 57:08.283
<i>my fellow students,
or my teammates.</i>

57:08.359 --> 57:10.418
I'll answer any questions
you have at this point.

57:10.495 --> 57:13.021
What do you think's
gonna happen to him?

57:13.097 --> 57:15.327
[TV volume decreases]

57:15.400 --> 57:18.267
I keep watching it
over and over.

57:18.336 --> 57:19.929
<i>I think it's all
I've done today.</i>

57:20.004 --> 57:21.995
Shepard will get picked up
by another team.

57:22.073 --> 57:23.063
I'd imagine.

57:23.141 --> 57:24.836
The thing is,
six of his teammates

57:24.909 --> 57:26.638
stepped down, too --
six of them --

57:26.711 --> 57:28.805
two of them white and
none of them starters.

57:28.880 --> 57:30.473
<i>They're the ones who are
gonna have some trouble.</i>

57:30.548 --> 57:32.038
What'd you come in
to tell me?

57:32.116 --> 57:33.743
I wrote the piece.

57:33.818 --> 57:35.582
I'll tell Luther to watch it.

57:35.653 --> 57:39.556
It takes the position the Confederate
flag is a symbol of a culture --

57:39.624 --> 57:42.025
a culture with a great tradition
of literature and art,

57:42.093 --> 57:45.222
-- music and architecture, great statesmen.
-- That's crap.

57:45.296 --> 57:47.924
-- So why are you telling me to write it?
-- I'm not telling you <i>to</i> do anything.

57:47.999 --> 57:49.228
I think we're all pretty
surprised

57:49.333 --> 57:51.267
you're not doing a commentary yourself.
What's going on?

57:51.302 --> 57:53.134
-- Nothing's going on.
-- What's going on, Isaac?

57:53.204 --> 57:54.968
[Sighs]

58:00.078 --> 58:02.513
I don't want to make
this into a big deal.

58:02.580 --> 58:04.070
You don't want to make
What into a big deal?

58:04.148 --> 58:06.378
Luther's been looking for
an opportunity to fire me.

58:07.318 --> 58:08.979
He has been for
about six months.

58:09.053 --> 58:11.317
-- Are you sure? 'Cause I
think you're wrong. -- No.

58:11.389 --> 58:13.187
-- <i>I'm not.</i> -- <i>He has</i> a <i>lot
of respect for you, Isaac,</i>

58:13.257 --> 58:15.316
and while I may not like
the guy, he's sure no idiot.

58:15.393 --> 58:17.828
I like my life right now.
I've never been happier.

58:17.895 --> 58:21.126
I used to pick fights with management
twice a day, just like you.

58:21.199 --> 58:23.634
<i>They wanted to fire me,
that was fine.</i>

58:23.701 --> 58:25.897
There was always someone
who wanted to hire me.

58:25.970 --> 58:27.438
That's not the way it is now.

58:27.505 --> 58:30.964
<i>Luther can hire someone
half my age to do my job.</i>

58:31.042 --> 58:34.876
I like my life right now,
and I'm proud of this show.

58:34.946 --> 58:36.880
I can't believe it.

58:36.948 --> 58:38.848
I come in here
with you talking about

58:38.916 --> 58:41.180
those six players who
stood by Roland Shepard,

58:41.252 --> 58:43.414
and you don't have the same respect
for the people who work for you?

58:44.889 --> 58:46.755
You don't think if Luther
ever showed you the door

58:46.824 --> 58:49.452
there wouldn't be about a hundred
people lined up right behind you?

58:49.527 --> 58:53.361
<i>There's something real bad going
on in Chattanooga, Isaac,</i>

58:53.431 --> 58:56.366
and Luther can fix it.
And you know it.

58:57.969 --> 59:00.836
Tell Dana to throw this one
out of the rundown.

59:00.905 --> 59:04.102
Tell her you're gonna do
a 2-minute editorial.

59:04.175 --> 59:05.336
Not this time.

59:06.911 --> 59:08.208
Okay.

59:08.279 --> 59:10.213
Yeah. Uh, Danny...

59:12.283 --> 59:14.547
Don't tell anyone
about what I said.

59:14.619 --> 59:17.179
Sure.

59:19.290 --> 59:21.987
<i>60 seconds to VTR.
Two minutes, live.</i>

59:22.059 --> 59:23.549
The Yankees win
the World Series.

59:23.628 --> 59:25.619
That was a big shock
after they won 114 games.

59:25.696 --> 59:28.597
What is it with this element of
surprise you people are looking for?

59:28.666 --> 59:30.191
You know
what we're forgetting?

59:30.268 --> 59:33.363
-- What? -- Michael Jordan and the
Bulls win the NBA championship.

59:33.437 --> 59:34.927
Yeah, there's something
that doesn't happen a lot.

59:35.006 --> 59:36.405
What do you guys think?

59:36.474 --> 59:38.602
-- <i>Us?</i>
-- <i>Yeah, what do you think?</i>

59:38.676 --> 59:39.700
-- About <i>what?</i>
-- <i>Play of the year.</i>

59:39.777 --> 59:40.938
We're eight days away.

59:41.012 --> 59:42.673
-- I hadn't really --
-- What <i>do</i> you think?

59:42.747 --> 59:44.476
We're studio technicians.

59:44.549 --> 59:46.677
<i>-- Yes' we know. -- These
are editorial questions.</i>

59:46.751 --> 59:48.344
Yes, we want to hear
what you have to say.

59:48.419 --> 59:50.717
-- Really? -- Go ahead.
There are no wrong answers.

59:50.788 --> 59:52.381
Nothing's too stupid
to suggest.

59:52.456 --> 59:55.426
Except women's ice hockey, but Kim
pretty much has that covered.

59:55.493 --> 59:56.551
So what do you think?

59:56.627 --> 59:58.527
-- You really want to know?
-- <i>Absolutely.</i>

59:58.596 --> 01:00:00.291
Mark O'Meara
winning two majors.

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:02.628
-- Cal Ripken ending the streak.
-- Peyton Manning.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.465
Well, that was a colossal
waste of time.

01:00:06.871 --> 01:00:07.804
Good evening.

01:00:07.872 --> 01:00:09.897
Isaac, I haven't
seen you all night.

01:00:09.974 --> 01:00:12.671
Dana, I hate to do this
to you on such short notice,

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:15.610
but I'd like a couple of
minutes of airtime tonight.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.081
-- Really? -- If you
need to make some room,

01:00:18.149 --> 01:00:20.811
I believe you can dump that piece
that Danny was planning on doing.

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:22.649
I don't think he'll mind.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.882
No, I don't believe
he will.

01:00:24.956 --> 01:00:26.822
He said something to
you, didn't he?

01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:29.292
Will...

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.794
get Isaac wired up.

01:00:30.862 --> 01:00:32.523
Sure.

01:00:36.267 --> 01:00:38.634
Earlier in the show, we told
you about Roland Shepard

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:41.229
and the six other players who
were dropped from their team

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:44.639
and then their school for refusing to
play football under the Confederate flag.

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:47.974
Here's Isaac Jaffee, managing
editor of “Sports Night,“

01:00:48.045 --> 01:00:50.139
with an editorial
comment. Isaac?

01:00:50.248 --> 01:00:52.239
Thank you, Casey.

01:00:52.283 --> 01:00:55.981
<i>Exaudio, comperio,
conloquor.</i>

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:58.681
That's a Latin phrase
that translates...

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:01.953
"To listen, to learn,
to speak."

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:04.495
Those words are carved
into the stone arches

01:01:04.562 --> 01:01:07.327
that form the entrance to
the undergraduate library

01:01:07.398 --> 01:01:09.298
at Tennessee
Western University.

01:01:09.367 --> 01:01:12.894
This afternoon, an extraordinary
young man named Roland Shepard

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:17.134
made what had to have been
an excruciating decision.

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:21.145
He said he wasn't playing football
under a Confederate flag.

01:01:21.212 --> 01:01:25.274
Six of his teammates then chose
not to let Shepard stand alone.

01:01:25.349 --> 01:01:27.977
And I choose to join them
at this moment.

01:01:28.052 --> 01:01:31.454
In the history of the South,
there's much to celebrate.

01:01:31.522 --> 01:01:34.389
And that flag is
a desecration of all of it.

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:36.927
It's a banner of hatred
and separatism.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.463
It's a banner of
ignorance and violence

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.363
and a war that pitted
brother against brother,

01:01:42.433 --> 01:01:45.061
and to ask young
black men and women,

01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:48.629
<i>young Jewish men and women,
Asians, Native Americans,</i>

01:01:48.706 --> 01:01:51.471
to ask Americans to walk
beneath its shadow

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:54.512
is a humiliation
of irreducible proportions.

01:01:54.578 --> 01:01:55.875
And we all know it.

01:01:55.947 --> 01:01:58.211
<i>Tennessee Western
has produced</i>

01:01:58.282 --> 01:02:00.649
<i>some outstanding alumni
in the last hundred years,</i>

01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:04.154
people of wisdom and vision,
strength and compassion.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:06.246
One of them is Luther Sachs.

01:02:06.324 --> 01:02:08.258
Luther Sachs owns
Continental Corp,

01:02:08.326 --> 01:02:10.226
which owns the
Continental Sports Channel,

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:12.388
which you're watching
right now.

01:02:12.463 --> 01:02:16.661
<i>Luther Sachs is a generous alumni
contributor to Tennessee Western</i>

01:02:16.734 --> 01:02:18.725
<i>with a considerable influence</i>

01:02:18.803 --> 01:02:21.272
over its chancellor,
Davis Blake,

01:02:21.339 --> 01:02:23.137
and its board of trustees.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:26.939
Luther, you've got
a phone call to make.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:30.170
<i>You've got to call
Chancellor Blake</i>

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:33.046
<i>and tell him
to take down that flag</i>

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:36.087
or he can stop looking
for your checks in the mail.

01:02:36.153 --> 01:02:40.420
You've got to put these young men back
in a classroom, and I mean pronto.

01:02:40.491 --> 01:02:43.552
These boys are gonna make you
proud one day, Luther.

01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:46.858
<i>I challenge you
to do the right thing</i> --

01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:48.399
not an unreasonable request

01:02:48.466 --> 01:02:50.901
to make of a man
whose alma mater declares,

01:02:50.968 --> 01:02:54.962
"Exaudio, comperio,
conloquor" --

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:59.476
to listen, to learn,
to speak.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:02.945
In the meantime, God go
with you, Roland Shepard,

01:03:03.014 --> 01:03:06.882
and you six Southern
gentlemen of Tennessee.

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:10.785
God's not done
with any of you yet.

01:03:12.857 --> 01:03:16.293
That was our managing
editor, Isaac Jaffee.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.623
We'll be back.

01:03:17.695 --> 01:03:19.754
<i>We're out.</i>

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:20.763
[Applause]

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:22.458
You can bring it, boss.

01:03:23.667 --> 01:03:25.795
You know I could kiss you on
the mouth right now, right?

01:03:25.870 --> 01:03:28.168
[Laughs]
Then stay over there.

01:03:28.239 --> 01:03:30.435
I could get very physical
with you right now.

01:03:30.508 --> 01:03:32.408
Danny...

01:03:32.476 --> 01:03:34.274
I'm having some
very kooky thoughts here.

01:03:34.345 --> 01:03:37.679
[indistinct talking]

01:03:41.886 --> 01:03:44.014
-- Thank you all.
-- Isaac...

01:03:44.088 --> 01:03:46.182
I can't even --
that was...

01:03:46.257 --> 01:03:47.816
-- I-| mean...
-- All right!

01:03:47.892 --> 01:03:50.156
We've lost radio contact
with Dana.

01:03:50.261 --> 01:03:51.228
[Laughter]

01:03:51.262 --> 01:03:52.696
-- <i>Isaac...</i>
-- <i>Yes?</i>

01:03:52.763 --> 01:03:54.959
No kidding --
play of the year.

01:03:55.032 --> 01:03:56.363
Thank you, Jeremy.

01:03:56.434 --> 01:03:58.425
Isaac?

01:03:58.502 --> 01:04:00.300
Showtime?

01:04:00.371 --> 01:04:02.499
Luther Sachs on line 4.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:08.376
Hey, Isaac...

01:04:08.446 --> 01:04:10.471
<i>Yes;?</i>

01:04:10.548 --> 01:04:13.609
Right behind ya.

01:04:13.684 --> 01:04:15.277
<i>Back in 10.</i>

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.548
It was -- I've never...

01:04:17.621 --> 01:04:18.679
<i>[Sighs]</i>

01:04:18.756 --> 01:04:21.020
I mean, I'm serious.
That was just...

01:04:21.092 --> 01:04:23.356
In 3...2...

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:25.828
That's all for tonight,
but before we sign off,

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:27.921
we felt that with Christmas
only a few days off

01:04:27.998 --> 01:04:30.490
and with people making up lists
and checking them twice,

01:04:30.568 --> 01:04:33.003
it was as good a time as
any to mention some people

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.664
who are important to us
here at the show.

01:04:35.739 --> 01:04:37.332
It seems that quite
a few of you, for instance,

01:04:37.408 --> 01:04:38.807
like the way Dan and I
dress on the air,

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:40.844
and you should know
that we're dressed

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:43.403
by Maureen Gates
and Joseph Roveto.

01:04:43.481 --> 01:04:46.712
Maureen and Joseph are assisted by a
young woman named Monica Brazelton,

01:04:46.784 --> 01:04:48.912
<i>and Monica is not
to be trifled with.</i>

01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.852
Our camera operators
are Ray,

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.980
Wayne, Bruce,
John, and Jerome,

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.116
who wishes we'd do
more features on hockey.

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:56.421
Not gonna happen, Jerome.

01:04:56.494 --> 01:04:59.191
Every time I pick up a pencil
or put down a coffee mug,

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:01.493
that's Jody Mann and her
trusty aid John Frantz,

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:04.660
and if you've ever wondered what
a gaffer was or a best boy,

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.260
you should ask
Keith and Mark.

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:07.896
We've got some people
who don't get paid much,

01:05:07.972 --> 01:05:09.565
but that's okay, 'cause
the hours are terrible.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.608
They're our P.A.s,
and their names are

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:14.610
Lauren, Victoria, Jake,
Lee, Ashley, and Brad.

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:16.578
This is a script.
Dan and I write it.

01:05:16.647 --> 01:05:19.673
And then two people come along and put
it together so that we can also read it.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.149
Their names are
Joan and Chris,

01:05:21.218 --> 01:05:23.186
and they, us, and everyone
else here are pretty much

01:05:23.254 --> 01:05:25.518
at the mercy of the script
supervisor, Carol MoKechnie,

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:28.354
who's got a little thing for me, and
I think it's time she admits it.

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:29.620
-- Keri McIntyre...
-- Nicole Burke...

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:31.252
-- <i>Shawn Hanley...</i>
-- <i>Jeff Wheat...</i>

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:32.454
-- Mark Johnson...
-- Cajun...

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.225
-- <i>Cajun...</i>
-- <i>How 'bout Skip Cook?</i>

01:05:34.298 --> 01:05:37.097
-- <i>How 'bout Phil</i> Heath? -- <i>How 'bout
Karen, Julie, and Angela in makeup?</i>

01:05:37.168 --> 01:05:38.863
How 'bout Brenda,
Cammy, and Jody in hair?

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:41.371
We've got film on this show.
You know who cuts it?

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:43.099
Janet Ashikaga.
Know who her assistant is?

01:05:43.174 --> 01:05:44.938
Laura the wonderful.

01:05:45.009 --> 01:05:46.875
We've just named a small
fraction of the people

01:05:46.944 --> 01:05:48.207
who put
this show on television,

01:05:48.279 --> 01:05:50.008
which means we've
left out many more,

01:05:50.114 --> 01:05:53.049
and we'll try and rectify that as
we head towards December 25th.

01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:56.485
But for now, I'm Casey
McCall alongside Dan Rydell

01:05:56.554 --> 01:05:58.579
wishing everyone
in your home,

01:05:58.656 --> 01:06:00.988
along with everyone
here at my home,

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.787
a very happy Christmas.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.521
Good night, everyone.

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.970
