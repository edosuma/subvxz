LET'S SEE A LITTLE BIT
MORE OF IT.

01:54.348 --> 01:55.916

02:03.691 --> 02:06.294
THANK YOU, MICHA.

02:06.327 --> 02:09.297
DIDN'T I TELL YOU FOOLS TO PUT

- YEAH.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.366
- * GONNA BE STRONG NOW

02:12.400 --> 02:14.402
- I'M THINKING,
FOR THE TOUR,

02:14.435 --> 02:16.337
I COULD GET
SOME OF THEM PEEP-TOE BOOTS

02:16.370 --> 02:18.506
LIKE MARY J. ROCKED.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.674
- AIN'T NOBODY GONNA BE
LOOKING AT YOUR TOES, GIRL.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.376
[laughs]
- WELL...

02:22.410 --> 02:24.278
[giggles]

02:24.312 --> 02:25.579
- CALEB.

02:25.613 --> 02:28.282
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR FIVE MINUTES

02:28.316 --> 02:29.417
WITHOUT YOU
GETTING TRASHY?

02:29.450 --> 02:31.252
- WHO YOU STEPPING TO?

02:31.285 --> 02:33.787
- YOU.
WITH THIS BEEF COOKIE.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.591
[laughter]
- OOH HOO HOO.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.929
- NICE.
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.631
- HEY, BABY,
I WAS JUST JOKING.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.333
- YEAH?

02:45.366 --> 02:47.368
HOW FUNNY IS THIS, HUH?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.439
TOUCH SOME OF THIS, BITCH.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.641
[grunts]

02:53.674 --> 02:55.343
- [whimpering]

02:55.376 --> 02:57.811
- SKINNY-ASS WHORE!

02:57.845 --> 03:00.214
- GET HER NECK.
ALL AROUND.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.382
- DO YOU NEED ME TO TURN?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.585
- YOU'RE DOING GREAT, MICHA.

03:04.618 --> 03:07.288
- I'VE SWABBED HER CUTS FOR DNA.
WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

03:07.321 --> 03:11.225
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.361
AGAIN, MICHA,

03:13.394 --> 03:16.630
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHO DID THIS TO YOU.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.300
- HE DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT.

03:19.333 --> 03:22.403
- "HE" WHO?
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

03:25.773 --> 03:28.742
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO TELL US HIS NAME.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.647
- CALEB.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.100
[fans cheering]

04:38.612 --> 04:40.948
- SO YOU DIDN'T SEE
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.817
- NO. BUT I CAN GUESS.

04:43.851 --> 04:45.919
- HER BOYFRIEND,
CALEB BRYANT?

04:45.953 --> 04:48.689
AND YOU'RE HIS PRODUCER?

04:48.722 --> 04:51.759
- NO. NOT ANYMORE.
I WORK WITH MICHA NOW.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.028
I DISCOVERED HER
WHEN SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.565
SHE'S LIKE
A DAUGHTER TO ME.

04:57.598 --> 05:01.835
THEIR RELATIONSHIP...
IS COMPLICATED.

05:01.869 --> 05:06.774
- NO, IT ISN'T.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.976
- [crying]
HE THREW ME DOWN.

05:09.009 --> 05:12.446
HE PUSHED MY FACE INTO...

05:12.480 --> 05:14.615
- HIS CROTCH?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.584
- I TRIED TO GET AWAY.

05:16.617 --> 05:20.554
BUT MY HEAD HIT HIS LIP.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.923
THAT'S WHEN HE WENT OFF.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.092
- HE BEAT YOU.

05:25.125 --> 05:30.063
HE CHOKED YOU.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.666
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO ELSE WAS IN THE ROOM?

05:32.700 --> 05:35.068
- [sighs]
THE ENGINEER.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.970
THE BACKUP GIRLS.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.940
- SO THIS WENT ON
FOR A WHILE.

05:41.975 --> 05:42.910
- [sighs]

05:42.943 --> 05:45.613
WHEN CALEB GOES OFF...

05:45.646 --> 05:49.683
- I CAN SEE THAT.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.720
[dance music playing]

05:52.753 --> 05:59.793
*

05:59.827 --> 06:02.630
- WHOA.
POLICE JOINING THE PARTY.

06:02.663 --> 06:03.997
- CALEB BRYANT.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.633
- AND THEY SAY YOU PEOPLE
DON'T HAVE NO FUN.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.634
HERE, LET ME TWEET
YOUR FACES TO MY FANS.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.135
- [giggles]

06:08.168 --> 06:11.605
- ALL RIGHT, CALEB, YOU MIND
LETTING US SEE YOUR HANDS?

06:13.140 --> 06:15.008
- BEEN HITTING
SOMETHING TONIGHT?

06:15.042 --> 06:17.711
- JUST HOLDING BACK
AN OVERENTHUSIASTIC FAN.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.146
- GUESS WHAT, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE

06:19.179 --> 06:21.148
WHERE YOU AIN'T GOTTA WORRY
ABOUT THE FANS.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.883
- UNDER ARREST.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.018
- YOU TWO ARE MAKING
A BIG MISTAKE.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.387
CALL MY JEW.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.825
- EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVES.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.928
YOU TOOK
MY CLIENT'S CLOTHES.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.864
- COUNSELOR.

06:36.897 --> 06:37.865
- THAT'S HARASSMENT.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.166
- THEY'RE EVIDENCE.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.868
- THE JACKET ALONE
IS $5,000.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.903
I HOPE EVERYTHING'S
BEEN PROPERLY VOUCHERED.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.872
- DOWN TO THE LAST
BLOODSTAIN.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.675
- AND I TRUST YOU HAVEN'T
QUESTIONED HIM IN MY ABSENCE.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.042
- HE KNOWS
BETTER THAN THAT.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.678
- FINE. I'D LIKE
TO SEE YOUR CAPTAIN.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.045
I'D LIKE TO HAVE A WORD.
- HE'S OUT.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.882
SERGEANT MUNCH IS COVERING.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.719
[camera clicks]

06:58.752 --> 07:01.955
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA SEE
ANOTHER KIND OF PICTURES?

07:01.989 --> 07:04.492
- NOBODY'S INTERESTED, ROMEO.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.094
- IF YOU GUYS WERE SMART,

07:07.127 --> 07:09.229
YOU COULD SAVE YOURSELVES
A LOT OF EMBARRASSMENT.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.633
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU
SUGGEST WE DO?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.468
- SEE, YOU COPS--
YOU SEE A BIG FISH

07:14.502 --> 07:17.004
OF THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN
PERSUASION, AND YOU, OHH,

07:17.037 --> 07:19.940
YOU JUST START SALIVATING
TO BRING HIM DOWN.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.975
- GO ON.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.211
- HOW MANY RUSHED INVESTIGATIONS
HAVE YOU SEEN?

07:24.244 --> 07:27.581
CORNERS CUT,
CONCLUSIONS JUMPED TO?

07:27.615 --> 07:30.083
THEN EVERYTHING JUST
GETS IN A BIG PILE OF ASHES

07:30.117 --> 07:33.821
AND...APOLOGIES.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.922
LAWSUITS.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.957
- THAT'S HAPPENED.
- YEAH.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.125
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT IT
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

07:38.158 --> 07:41.929
BECAUSE CALEB
IS A BIG SUPERSTAR.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.197
HE HAS SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES,

07:44.231 --> 07:48.068
HE HAS A STELLAR REPUTATION--
HE'S LOVED IN THIS CITY.

07:48.101 --> 07:51.505
CAN THE NYPD SAY THE SAME?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.547
I WANT TO SEE MY CLIENT.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.615
- YEAH, THE ONE WHO KEPT
ASKING FOR HIS "JEW"?

08:01.649 --> 08:04.952
HE'S THAT WAY, COUNSELOR.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.988
- YOU'RE STILL SMILING?
WHAT, YOU TWO BOND IN THERE?

08:08.021 --> 08:09.890
- OH, JUST A CONCERNED CITIZEN
MAKING SURE

08:09.923 --> 08:11.825
THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T
EMBARRASS ITSELF.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.861
- HE'S HOPING THAT HIS CLIENT
DOESN'T EMBARRASS HIMSELF.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.863
I MEAN, LOOK.
THIS THING'S GONE VIRAL.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.834
- BABY-FACED BAD BOY
CALEB BRYANT

08:20.868 --> 08:24.271
HAD HIS GANGSTA CRED
BOOSTED TONIGHT WHEN POLICE

08:24.304 --> 08:28.208
HAULED HIM OUT OF A MANHATTAN
NIGHTCLUB IN HANDCUFFS.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.309
- THEY SHOULD
GO ON A DOUBLE DATE

08:29.342 --> 08:30.811
WITH CHRIS BROWN AND RIHANNA.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.212
- TOO BAD THERE WERE
NO PAPARAZZI

08:32.245 --> 08:33.981
IN THAT RECORDING STUDIO.

08:34.014 --> 08:35.215
- ANY WITNESSES
TO THE ATTACK?

08:35.248 --> 08:37.150
- WELL, AT LEAST THREE,
ACCORDING TO MICHA.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.719
- WELL, WE NEED TO GET TO 'EM
BEFORE CALEB'S PEOPLE DO.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.053
- AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

08:40.087 --> 08:41.655
LET'S MAKE SURE
THAT CALEB'S PEOPLE

08:41.689 --> 08:43.991
DON'T GET TO MICHA EITHER.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.795
- SERIOUSLY?

08:47.828 --> 08:49.963
YOU WANT ME TO TESTIFY
AGAINST CALEB?

08:49.997 --> 08:51.565
- IF YOU SAW
AN ASSAULT, YEAH.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.734
- AND WHAT IF I EVER
WANT TO WORK AGAIN?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.703
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
WITH THE WIGGERS AND WANNABES.

08:55.736 --> 08:57.705
- HE BEAT THAT GIRL BAD.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.172
- I'M NOT SAYING
I SAW ANYTHING,

08:59.206 --> 09:01.008
BUT, YOU KNOW,
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE DISSED HIM.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.176
GUYS LIKE CALEB NEED
TO GET THEIR OWN WAY.

09:03.210 --> 09:06.079
EXCUSE ME.

09:06.113 --> 09:09.883
- I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.952
- WELL, YOU WERE WITH CALEB
AND MICHA BEFORE IT HAPPENED.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.287
YOU WERE WITH CALEB
AT THE NIGHTCLUB.

09:14.321 --> 09:16.924
- SO? I MUST'VE BEEN IN THE
LADIES' ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.894
YOU ROLLIN' WITH CALEB,
YOUR LOOK HAS GOT TO BE TIGHT.

09:20.928 --> 09:23.330
- YOU WANNA BE CALEB'S NEXT?
AFTER LAST NIGHT?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.165
- LOOK, I KNOW
WHEN TO KEEP MY MOUTH OPEN,

09:25.198 --> 09:29.770
AND WHEN TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.706
- A PUNCH?
I'D SAY IT WAS MORE LIKE A SLAP.

09:32.740 --> 09:36.209
- OPEN HAND? CLOSED HAND?
CAN YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE? OR--

09:36.243 --> 09:38.646
- ALL RIGHT,
HE PUNCHED HER.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.615
- DID YOU SEE HIM CHOKE HER?
- FOR A HOT SECOND.

09:41.649 --> 09:43.283
- THERE'S A THREE-SECOND RULE
IN CHOKING.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.785
- I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.353
I'M JUST SAYING
IT WAS REAL QUICK.

09:46.386 --> 09:50.758
- IT WAS TOO QUICK FOR YOU
TO HELP HER OUT, MR. FERRARI?

09:52.325 --> 09:56.096
JUST WATCH HER GET BEAT?

09:56.129 --> 09:58.131
- [sighs]

10:01.802 --> 10:03.236
- WELL, WHERE'S
THE PLASTIC SURGEON?

10:03.270 --> 10:04.738
TELL 'EM TO SEND A LIMO.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.006
TELL 'EM TO SEND
A DAMN HELICOPTER.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.007
WHAT ARE YOU--
ALICIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:07.040 --> 10:08.208
I SAID NO PRESS!

10:08.241 --> 10:10.978
OH, YEAH,
JUST GET HIM HERE.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.280
LISTEN, UH...

10:13.313 --> 10:15.182
MICHA'S RESTING.
THIS CAN WAIT, RIGHT?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.817
- NO, IT CAN'T.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.951
I'M DETECTIVE BENSON,

10:17.985 --> 10:20.654
AND THIS IS ASSISTANT
DISTRICT ATTORNEY RAFAEL BARBA.

10:20.688 --> 10:22.289
- HOW YOU DOING?

10:22.322 --> 10:23.957
LISTEN, SHE'S GONNA ISSUE A
STATEMENT THROUGH HER PUBLICIST.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.292
- IT CAN'T WAIT. MEANWHILE,
WE NEED TO SPEAK TO HER.

10:25.325 --> 10:28.896
- [sighs]
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.130
- HOW ABOUT YOU WAIT HERE?

10:30.163 --> 10:31.398
- UH--
- THANK YOU.

10:31.431 --> 10:35.268
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.270
- DON'T GO NOWHERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.006
- BIG SMILE.
- TRUST ME.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.974
- MICHA.
- YO, BUY MY ALBUM!

10:41.008 --> 10:43.410
[laughter on TV]

10:43.443 --> 10:45.245
- HOW YOU FEELING?

10:45.278 --> 10:46.947
- YOU HAD
TO DO THIS TO CALEB?

10:46.980 --> 10:50.383
- HE DID IT TO HIMSELF.
AND TO YOU.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.419
- NOT ACCORDING
TO MY TWITTER FEED.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.455
THEY'RE EITHER CALLING ME A HO
OR BEGGING ME TO FORGIVE HIM.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.858
- ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT, YOU
SHOULD BLOCK THEM IMMEDIATELY.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.360
'CAUSE WHAT HE DID TO YOU
IS DESPICABLE.

11:00.393 --> 11:03.997
MICHA, THIS IS RAFAEL BARBA
FROM THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.699
- I'LL BE HANDLING
THE PROSECUTION.

11:05.733 --> 11:08.435
- PROSECUTION?
IS THAT NECESSARY?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.437
- UNLESS HE PLEADS GUILTY,
THIS WILL GO TO TRIAL.

11:10.470 --> 11:14.041
- YOU MEAN
I HAVE TO TESTIFY?

11:14.074 --> 11:14.975
IN PUBLIC?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.945
- THAT MAY HAPPEN, YES.

11:17.978 --> 11:21.048
- BUT WE WILL BE WITH YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.816
NOW, IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD

11:22.850 --> 11:23.751
IF YOU HAD
SOME OTHER SUPPORT THERE.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.419
LIKE IS THERE ANY FAMILY
THAT YOU CAN CALL?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.856
- MY SISTERS, MY MOTHER,
HER BOYFRIEND.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.025
IF THEY COME UP HERE I'MA HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THEM.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.494
- OKAY, SO,
WHAT ABOUT BRASS?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.963
HE'S YOUR MENTOR, RIGHT?

11:35.996 --> 11:38.165
- IF I NEED SOMEONE TO SAY,
"I TOLD YOU SO."

11:38.198 --> 11:40.734
LOOK...

11:40.768 --> 11:42.870
I'VE BEEN ON MY OWN
A LONG TIME.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.906
- AND HERE YOU ARE AGAIN.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.107
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.408
AND LOOK AT HIM.

11:48.441 --> 11:53.046
ACTING AS IF
NOTHING EVER HAPPENED.

11:57.484 --> 12:01.454
- CALEB THINKS HE CAN DO THIS
TO ME AND GET AWAY WITH IT?

12:01.488 --> 12:04.057
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.161
[people chattering]

12:08.195 --> 12:09.863
[gavel bangs]

12:09.897 --> 12:12.065
- I'LL HAVE QUIET
OR I'LL CLEAR THE COURTROOM!

12:12.099 --> 12:14.968
[chatter continues]

12:15.002 --> 12:17.771
OFFICERS!
- EVERYBODY, SIT DOWN.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.907
- EVERYBODY, QUIET, COME ON!
[gallery quiets down]

12:19.940 --> 12:22.509
- CALEB BRYANT,
YOU ARE CHARGED

12:22.542 --> 12:25.478
WITH ATTEMPTED SEXUAL ABUSE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

12:25.512 --> 12:27.047
ASSAULT IN THE SECOND DEGREE,

12:27.080 --> 12:28.115
AND STRANGULATION
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

12:28.148 --> 12:31.018
NICE TRIFECTA.
DO WE HAVE A PLEA?

12:31.051 --> 12:32.853
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.287
THESE ARE
TWO PASSIONATE PEOPLE

12:34.321 --> 12:36.423
WHOSE PRIVATE MOMENT HAS BEEN
WILDLY MISCHARACTERIZED.

12:36.456 --> 12:39.059
- SAVE IT FOR TRIAL.
PEOPLE ON BAIL?

12:39.092 --> 12:39.793
- THE DEFENDANT
HAS MASSIVE RESOURCES

12:39.827 --> 12:41.428
AND A PROPENSITY
FOR VIOLENCE.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.964
WE REQUEST REMAND.
- PLEASE, YOUR HONOR.

12:43.997 --> 12:47.935
MY CLIENT HAS A SOLD-OUT CONCERT
NEXT WEEK AT BARCLAYS CENTER.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.169
HE'S NOT GOING TO
DISAPPOINT HIS FANS.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.205
- I HOPE NOT.
BAIL'S SET AT 500,000.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.207
- WE ALSO REQUEST A TEMPORARY
ORDER OF PROTECTION.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.909
THE DEFENDANT REPRESENTS
AN ONGOING THREAT TO THE VICTIM,

12:55.943 --> 12:58.411
PARTICULARLY AS HE'S SHOWN
ABSOLUTELY NO REMORSE.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.147
- WE ARE TALKING HERE
ABOUT TWO PEOPLE

13:00.180 --> 13:02.349
WHO ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE,
YOUR HONOR.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.583
- AND LOVE HURTS, RIGHT?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.085
THE DEFENDANT
IS ORDERED TO STAY

13:05.118 --> 13:07.921
1,000 YARDS AWAY
FROM MICHA GREEN.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.189
[bangs gavel]

13:09.222 --> 13:11.892
[people chattering]

13:11.925 --> 13:15.562
- IF CALEB BRYANT
WERE SINGING OPERA AT THE MET,

13:15.595 --> 13:19.032
YOU ALL KNOW
WE WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY.

13:19.066 --> 13:24.037
THE D.A.'S OFFICE AND NYPD
ARE PERPETUATING THE STEREOTYPE

13:24.071 --> 13:27.174
THAT HIP-HOP ARTISTS
ARE GANGSTER THUGS.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.043
- Y'ALL KNOW ME.
I'M A LOVER, NOT A FIGHTER.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.245
AND I LOVE MICHA.
SHE KNOWS THAT.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.247
SHE KNOWS
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.016
SHE'S NOT GONNA LET NYPD

13:36.049 --> 13:38.886
SEND ANOTHER
INNOCENT BLACK MAN TO JAIL.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.554
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.
I GUESS WE CAN ALL JUST GO HOME.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.556
- HEY, DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
HIS CHARM.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.159
- I DON'T. HE'S WORKING HER,
HE'S WORKING THE JURY.

13:46.193 --> 13:47.995
- MICHA KNOWS WHAT HE DID.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.463
SO DOES FERRARI THE SOUND MIXER,
AND FORENSICS BACK IT UP.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.232
- THIS WOULD BE TOUGH ENOUGH
FOR A GROWN WOMAN,

13:52.265 --> 13:55.035
BUT FOR A TEENAGE GIRL
IN THE GLARE OF THE SPOTLIGHT?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.503
- ALL RIGHT, HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?
LOOK AT THIS.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.038
- OH, MR. PRICE.
COME ON DOWN.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.908
- MICHA GREEN,
THE SINGING PHENOM

14:00.941 --> 14:03.176
WITH THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL
AND THE BODY OF A VIXEN

14:03.210 --> 14:06.113
NOW HAS THE FACE
OF A GARGOYLE,

14:06.146 --> 14:09.983
AS THIS TRULY SHOCKING
PHOTO SHOWS.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.920
- CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW THIS PICTURE GOT OUT?

14:12.953 --> 14:14.654
- OKAY, NOT FROM MY OFFICE.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.556
- IT'S BEEN VIEWED 200,000 TIMES
IN AN HOUR.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.491
IT'S UNACCEPTABLE.
- WOW.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.593
SOUND MORE UPSET ABOUT THAT
THAN YOU DO THE BEATING.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.995
- WE ARE ALL
CONCERNED ABOUT MICHA.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.031
- YEAH, NOT JUST
ABOUT HER HEALTH,

14:24.064 --> 14:26.599
BUT ALL ASPECTS OF HER LIFE,
INCLUDING HER BRAND.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.969
- HER BRAND?
OH, RIGHT, I'M SORRY.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.504
UH, CORPORATIONS ARE PEOPLE,
PEOPLE ARE BRANDS.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.306
- COME ON, MICHA'S
GOT AN ALBUM ABOUT TO DROP.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.175
SHE'S GOT FOUR MAJOR
ENDORSEMENTS PENDING,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.210
INCLUDING ONE
FROM A COSMETICS COMPANY,

14:37.244 --> 14:41.414
AND THIS--THIS IS NOT THE FACE
THAT THEY WANT SELLING MAKEUP.

14:41.448 --> 14:45.652
- MICHA, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO YOUR BRAND,

14:45.685 --> 14:47.420
YOU'RE ALSO A ROLE MODEL.

14:47.454 --> 14:51.291
WOMEN AND GIRLS
LOOK UP TO YOU.

14:51.324 --> 14:54.527
IF YOU STAND UP
AND SAY, "NO MORE"--

14:54.561 --> 14:56.296
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
ABOUT A TRIAL.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.465
AND LIKE MR. PRICE SAYS,

14:58.498 --> 15:00.533
THINGS ARE STARTING
TO HAPPEN FOR ME.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.035
THE SINGLE WITH CALEB--

15:02.069 --> 15:03.336
- CALEB?

15:03.370 --> 15:08.541
MICHA, THE CALEB
THAT DID THIS TO YOU?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.944
- WHAT CALEB DID
WAS INDEFENSIBLE.

15:10.978 --> 15:14.147
BUT HE BREAKS THE LAW,
AND SHE GETS PUNISHED?

15:14.181 --> 15:19.152
- MICHA, WE KNOW
THAT WHEN MEN DO THIS ONCE,

15:19.186 --> 15:21.688
THEY DO IT AGAIN.

15:21.721 --> 15:26.059
THE BOTTOM LINE HERE
IS THAT YOU ARE NOT SAFE.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.163
- I WANT THIS TO BE OVER.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.232
I DON'T WANT THE WORLD
TO SEE ME LIKE THAT.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.402
LIKE A VICTIM.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.470
THIS IS MY CALL.

15:58.025 --> 15:58.558
- A SURPRISING TURN TODAY

15:59.592 --> 16:01.294
IN THE CASE AGAINST MUSIC
SUPERSTAR CALEB BRYANT,

16:01.328 --> 16:02.729
WHO HAD BEEN CHARGED
WITH ASSAULTING HIS GIRLFRIEND,

16:02.762 --> 16:04.464
THE YOUNG SINGER MICHA GREEN.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.233
SOURCES CLOSE
TO THE ENTERTAINERS TELL US

16:06.266 --> 16:08.135
THAT MICHA HAS WITHDRAWN
HER COMPLAINT

16:08.168 --> 16:10.637
AGAINST THE POPULAR PERFORMER
IN THE HOPE THAT THE COUPLE

16:13.140 --> 16:14.107
- BARBA, YOU CAN TAKE THIS
TO TRIAL WITHOUT MICHA.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.710
YOU DON'T NEED HER TESTIMONY.
- THAT'S CHANGED.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.479
THE CRAWFORD DECISION,
THANK YOU, JUDGE SCALIA,

16:19.512 --> 16:21.381
MADE THAT A HEAVIER LIFT.
- SO DOES THIS.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.550
ROLLINS SAYS FERRARI,
THE SOUND ENGINEER,

16:23.583 --> 16:25.752
JUST BOOKED A GIG
IN BUENOS AIRES.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.687
THAT'S THE GAME.
- OKAY.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.790
WE CAN'T JUST LET HIM WALK AWAY,
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.093
LOOK, CAN'T YOU PUSH
FOR A DEAL

16:33.126 --> 16:34.561
BEFORE THEY KNOW
THAT MICHA'S BACKING OUT?

16:34.594 --> 16:36.229
- IT'S TOO LATE.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.497
THEY'RE ALL PART OF THE SAME
MUSIC INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.366
- COME ON, BARBA.

16:39.399 --> 16:42.402
YOU CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE
WHEN YOU WANT TO BE.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.637
- [chuckles]

16:44.671 --> 16:46.539
- A DEAL.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.508
IS THIS "BE KIND
TO PROSECUTORS" MONTH?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.377
NOBODY TOLD ME.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.313
- THIS PICTURE.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.116
I FIND IT DISTURBING,
BUT PERVERSELY INSPIRING.

16:56.149 --> 16:58.451
- WELL, THAT PICTURE'S
NOT GONNA TAKE THE STAND, IS IT?

16:58.485 --> 17:01.221
- CALEB.
- NO.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.455
BUT THE DOCTOR
WHO EXAMINED HER WILL.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.590
AND HER NEUROLOGIST
WILL TALK

17:03.623 --> 17:05.492
ABOUT THE EFFECTS
OF STRANGULATION.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.593
YOU WERE PLAYING RUSSIAN
ROULETTE WITH MS. GREEN'S LIFE.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.561
- AND OUR WITNESSES
WILL DESCRIBE

17:08.595 --> 17:10.563
HER IRRATIONAL FURY AT MY GUY

17:10.597 --> 17:12.465
SIMPLY TALKING TO
ANOTHER WOMAN.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.235
HOW HE HAD TO DEFEND HIMSELF
AGAINST HER RAGE.

17:15.268 --> 17:16.536
WHICH, OF COURSE,
SHE WILL REBUT--

17:16.569 --> 17:19.306
OH, NO,
SHE'S NOT TESTIFYING.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.774
- BECAUSE MICHA KNOWS
I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT HER.

17:21.808 --> 17:25.845
- STILL, THIS PUTS A CHIP
IN THE FAIRYTALE ROMANCE,

17:25.878 --> 17:28.548
THE ALL-AMERICAN SMILE.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.650
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
TURN AGAINST YOU, CALEB.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.485
YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT MICHA.

17:32.519 --> 17:35.488
DON'T JUST TELL ME.
TELL THE WORLD.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.824
ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.
APOLOGIZE.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.360
- YOU'RE A PUBLIC RELATIONS
EXPERT NOW?

17:40.393 --> 17:42.162
- PEOPLE RESPECT
A MAN WHO MANS UP.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.598
YOU'RE GONNA SAY YOU WERE
DEFENDING YOURSELF AGAINST HER?

17:45.632 --> 17:48.101
WHAT DOES SHE WEIGH?
95 POUNDS?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.769
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
LET'S GET THE HELL OUTTA HERE.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.871
- LET THE SUIT SPEAK.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.507
- ADMIT THE SIN.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.577
AND REPENT.
PUBLICLY.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.783
EVERYBODY LOVES
A GOOD REDEMPTION STORY.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.318
- WHAT ARE YOU PROPOSING?

18:05.352 --> 18:09.689
- SOMETHING
WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.159
- THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT IT?
- PUT A CLOCK ON THE OFFER.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.560
IT'S 9:00 P.M.,
THEY'VE GOT 12 HOURS.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.228
- GREAT. WHAT'S THE DEAL?

18:15.262 --> 18:16.596
- HE PLEADS TO ASSAULT.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.565
FIVE YEARS SUSPENDED SENTENCE,
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.267
- HOLD ON, NO JAIL TIME?

18:20.300 --> 18:21.668
- WELL,
WE GET A FELONY CONVICTION.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.470
HE DOES THIS AGAIN,
HE'S A TWO-TIME LOSER.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.572
- IF HE DOES THIS AGAIN,
MICHA MIGHT NOT BE ALIVE.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.574
LOOK, WHEN AN OFFENDER
STRANGLES HIS VICTIM,

18:27.607 --> 18:28.808
HE'S TEN TIMES
MORE LIKELY...

18:28.841 --> 18:30.877
- TO KILL THE VICTIM.
- TO KILL HIS VICTIM.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.446
- I WENT TO HER SEMINAR.
IT WAS TERRIFIC.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.148
- BUT THEN YOU KNOW
THIS DEAL SUCKS.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.749
- NO WITNESS, NO VICTIM.
I PLAYED THE HAND I HAD.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.585
- WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
CALEB'S PLAYING HIS.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.222
"DID YOU SEE ME ON WENDY?
A MESSAGE FOR THE BRYANT TEAM."

18:42.255 --> 18:45.192
LOOKS LIKE IT AIRED TODAY.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.494
- I KNOW HOW HARD THIS HAS BEEN
FOR BOTH OF YOU

18:47.527 --> 18:49.596
AND THE FANS THAT LOVE YOU.

18:49.629 --> 18:54.601
BUT YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAVE
A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FOR MICHA.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.536
- AND 2 MILLION
OTHER VIEWERS.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.671
- I DO, WENDY, I DO.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.374
I'M GONNA PRETEND
YOU GUYS AREN'T HERE.

19:01.408 --> 19:04.177
[clears throat]

19:04.211 --> 19:07.480
MICHA, I LOVE YOU.

19:07.514 --> 19:09.382
AND THAT I HURT YOU,
IT TEARS ME UP,

19:09.416 --> 19:11.384
BUT THAT GUY WASN'T ME.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.821
AND THIS GUY, THE REAL ME,
IS SO, SO SORRY.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.924
AND I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING
TO PROVE THAT TO YOU.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.927
I'M CANCELING MY TOUR,
ALL MY CONCERT DATES,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.497
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW,
MAKING THINGS RIGHT WITH YOU

19:24.531 --> 19:27.367
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

19:27.400 --> 19:32.239
THIS FRIENDSHIP RING
IS FOR YOU, MICH.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.407
I'M HOPING ONE DAY
YOU'LL WEAR IT.

19:34.441 --> 19:36.243
- WOW, HE'S WORKING IT.

19:36.276 --> 19:37.877
LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK YOUR ADVICE,
COUNSELOR.

19:37.910 --> 19:40.247
- INSTEAD OF A COURT OF LAW,
HE'S PLEADING OUT ON CABLE.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.449
THE PEOPLES' COURT.
- REDEMPTION WITHOUT THE FELONY.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.416
- AND HE'S SMART.

19:43.450 --> 19:45.785
THAT RING'S RIGHT OUT
OF KOBE'S HANDBOOK.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.688
- AND HE'S TWEETING,
AGAIN...

19:48.721 --> 19:52.959
[scoffs] "BBC UPDATE.
MY GIRL IS SHAFTMATIZED."

19:52.992 --> 19:56.429
WITH A PHOTO.

19:58.431 --> 20:00.633
- THAT BEDSPREAD.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.469
THAT'S IN MICHA'S
HOTEL ROOM.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.671
- HIS STAY AWAY ORDER'S
STILL IN EFFECT, RIGHT?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.340
- ABSOLUTELY.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.444
- WHERE IS SHE?

20:11.478 --> 20:12.845
- HEY, MAN,
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN BITCH.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.847
- MICHA!

20:14.881 --> 20:16.449
YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M FINE.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.884
- IF YOU'D HAVE COME
A MINUTE LATER,

20:17.917 --> 20:19.719
SHE'D HAVE BEEN
WAY MORE OKAY.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.754
- DOES THAT LOOK LIKE
1,000 YARDS TO YOU?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.556
- PUT SOME CLOTHES ON.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.824
- FOR WHAT?
TELL 'EM, MICHA!

20:24.857 --> 20:26.693
- NO, I TOLD HIM
HE COULD BE HERE.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.395
- IT'S NOT UP TO YOU!

20:41.874 --> 20:42.909
- IN A CASE THAT WILL NOT STOP
TWISTING AND TURNING,

20:43.843 --> 20:45.778
BAD BOY CALEB BRYANT IS BACK
IN COURT TODAY

20:45.812 --> 20:47.480
ACCUSED OF VIOLATING
THE RESTRAINING ORDER

20:47.514 --> 20:49.349
THAT KEPT HIM AWAY FROM HIS
GIRLFRIEND

20:49.382 --> 20:50.817
AND DUET PARTNER MICHA GREEN.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.286
DEMONSTRATORS OPPOSING
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

20:53.320 --> 20:55.422
ARE CALLING
FOR A PRISON SENTENCE...

20:55.455 --> 20:56.956
[overlapping chanting]

21:02.362 --> 21:03.262
- IT'S AN HONEST
MISUNDERSTANDING, YOUR HONOR.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.768
MY CLIENT ASSUMED THAT MS. GREEN
COULD RESCIND THE ORDER.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.337
- HE THINKS
SHE'S A JUDGE NOW.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.572
- IT'S--IT'S ALL MY FAULT,
I APOLOGIZE,

21:12.605 --> 21:14.707
AND I SHOULD'VE
EXPLAINED THINGS MORE CLEARLY.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.343
- IF MR. COHEN WOULD LIKE
TO JOIN HIS CLIENT IN JAIL,

21:16.376 --> 21:18.077
I HAVE NO OBJECTION.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.479
- THANK YOU,
MR. BARBA, I HAVE THIS.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.047
MR. BRYANT...

21:21.080 --> 21:24.617
DID YOU FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
I SAID TO YOU THE OTHER DAY?

21:24.651 --> 21:26.986
- I UNDERSTOOD
YOU WERE PROTECTING MICHA.

21:27.019 --> 21:30.923
I THOUGHT IF SHE WAS
OKAY WITH SEEING ME--

21:30.957 --> 21:32.692
I MEANT NO DISRESPECT TO YOU.

21:32.725 --> 21:34.861
- OKAY.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.429
AND SINCE MS. GREEN
IS NOT MAKING A COMPLAINT,

21:36.463 --> 21:38.998
I'M GOING TO GIVE
MR. BRYANT 30 DAYS.

21:39.031 --> 21:39.999
SUSPENDED.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.935
LAST CHANCE.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.338
ANOTHER MISUNDERSTANDING,
AND YOU'RE OFF TO RIKERS.

21:45.372 --> 21:47.006
[bangs gavel]

21:50.142 --> 21:52.345
- SUSPENDED SENTENCE.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.080
NOW, WHY DIDN'T THE JUDGE
JUST ASK FOR A PHOTO WITH CALEB?

21:54.113 --> 21:56.583
- WHAT DID THEY PULL
TO GET ORTIZ?

21:56.616 --> 21:57.884
SHE TALKS TOUGH
BUT ALWAYS SENTENCES LIGHT.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.118
- I KNOW.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.920
IT'S AN ENDLESS
DISAPPOINTMENT TO NYPD

22:00.953 --> 22:03.423
THAT WE DON'T SUMMARILY
EXECUTE PEOPLE YOU ARREST.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.658
THIS ISN'T A CONSPIRACY.

22:05.692 --> 22:07.894
SHE SAW A FIRST OFFENSE,
CONTRITION,

22:07.927 --> 22:08.995
NO VIOLENCE
IN THE ENCOUNTER.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.897
- I SAW A WOMAN
WHO'S TRAUMATIZED,

22:10.930 --> 22:12.064
WHO DOESN'T REALIZE
THE DANGER THAT SHE'S IN.

22:12.098 --> 22:14.000
- IT'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.603
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THE COURTS
CAN DO UNTIL THE VICTIM'S READY.

22:16.636 --> 22:19.071
YOU KEEP TALKING TO HER.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.608
- TEAM UMIZOOMI!

22:21.641 --> 22:23.142
HAVE FUN TODAY?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.378
HEY...

22:25.412 --> 22:28.715
I DON'T THINK
YOU SAW MY NEW TATTOO.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.983
- THAT MICHA'S FACE
AFTER YOU BEAT HER?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.052
- HEY, IT'S JUST ART.
[laughs]

22:33.085 --> 22:34.053
- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME, NICK,
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

22:34.086 --> 22:35.922
- WHAT IS THAT?
- WHAT?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.757
- IN YOUR JACKET, IS THAT A GUN?
- ARE YOU TRIPPIN'?

22:37.790 --> 22:40.059
- BACK UP, GUYS.
- COME ON, ASSUME THE POSITION.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.663
- BACK UP.
- WHAT IS THAT?

22:43.696 --> 22:48.468
- COURVOISIER.
BUT NOT FOR YOU. [laughs]

22:48.501 --> 22:50.570
- AH...
- WHAT?

22:50.603 --> 22:52.071
- WEED.

22:52.104 --> 22:55.808
COME ON.
LET'S TAKE A WALK.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.043
TURN AROUND.
[handcuffs click]

22:57.076 --> 22:58.745
TAKE OFF YOUR BELT.

22:58.778 --> 23:02.114
- SERIOUSLY?
[chuckles]

23:02.148 --> 23:03.916
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.785
YOU'RE A GOOD-LOOKING GUY,
NICE SMILE.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.053
I WOULD THINK YOU'D GET ME.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.421
- TAKE OFF YOUR LACES.

23:08.455 --> 23:11.424
- [laughs]

23:11.458 --> 23:12.959
[groans]

23:12.992 --> 23:16.996
COME ON, BLUE BLOOD.
WE'RE BOTH PLAYERS.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.165
YOU PLAY THE GOOD GUY
WHO RUNS THE CHARM

23:19.198 --> 23:20.767
AND THE "I'LL PROTECT YOU"
ROUTINE.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.168
- AND I KNOW YOUR PLAY.

23:22.201 --> 23:25.137
"I LOVE YOU,
I BEAT YOU, I'M SORRY."

23:25.171 --> 23:29.141
- WHATEVER THEY WANT.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.910
YOU NEVER USED WHAT YOU GOT

23:30.943 --> 23:35.982
TO GET OVER ON A WOMAN?

23:36.015 --> 23:37.884
- I'VE TAKEN
YOUR LETHAL ITEMS,

23:37.917 --> 23:40.152
BUT FEEL FREE
TO BANG YOUR HEAD

23:40.186 --> 23:45.057
AGAINST THE WALL.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.893
- CONGRATULATIONS.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.962
CALEB WAS RORed LAST NIGHT AND
BACK IN THE CLUB BY MIDNIGHT.

23:49.996 --> 23:51.998
- WELL, IT WAS A GOOD BUST.
HE WAS CARRYING.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.466
- HALF A GRAM OF POT?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.468
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO GET A MOSQUITO HIGH.

23:55.502 --> 23:58.137
CALEB HAS ALREADY FILED
A CCRB COMPLAINT,

23:58.170 --> 24:00.139
WHICH MEANS YOU KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO?

24:00.172 --> 24:02.241
50 HOURS OF DELIGHTFUL
CONVERSATION

24:02.274 --> 24:03.976
ON WHY YOU FRISKED HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.712
- I SAW
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A GUN.

24:05.745 --> 24:09.749
- LIV, DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE
THIS MENACING COGNAC FLASK?

24:09.782 --> 24:11.083
- LOOK, I WAS STANDING
RIGHT THERE.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.885
THE STOP-AND-FRISK
WAS BY THE BOOK.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.054
- LOOK, MY DAD USED TO TALK
WITH HIS FISTS. I KNOW CALEB.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.657
HE'S A REAL THREAT
TO THAT GIRL.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.058
- AND THE MORE
YOU HARASS HIM,

24:19.091 --> 24:21.027
THE MORE YOU
DRIVE MICHA TOWARDS HIM.

24:21.060 --> 24:23.062
ROMEO AND JULIET 101.

24:23.095 --> 24:25.832
- THANKS.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.767
- MAKE YOU MISS CRAGEN?

24:27.800 --> 24:28.935
- HE'S RIGHT.
I DON'T LIKE THE GUY.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.136
- ME NEITHER.

24:30.169 --> 24:31.738
CALEB'S LATEST TWEET,

24:31.771 --> 24:33.940
"MICH TOLD THE JUDGE
HOW MUCH I MISS MY BITCH.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.742
LOVING YOU
SHOULDN'T BE A CRIME."

24:35.775 --> 24:38.177
I HOPE TO GOD SHE'S NOT
FALLING FOR THIS.

24:38.210 --> 24:41.781
- I TRIED REACHING OUT TO HER,
SHE WON'T CALL ME BACK.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.484
- THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMEONE
SHE LISTENS TO.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.188
- MWAH!

24:49.221 --> 24:52.191
TAKE CARE OF MOMMY,
LITTLE MAN.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.961
- I SAW THAT CONCERT
WITH MY SON.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.029
I WAS LIKE DAD OF THE BLOCK
FOR A MONTH.

24:57.063 --> 24:59.131
YOU WAS FIRE, BABY.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.734
- YEAH,
BUT I HELD IT TOGETHER.

25:01.768 --> 25:02.969
DIDN'T GO UP IN FLAMES.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.070
- LIKE CALEB?

25:04.103 --> 25:06.105
- WELL, HE GREW UP IN FIRE.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.307
YOU KNOW,
HIS DAD WAS A PIMP.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.843
SO TO HIM, THAT'S WHAT
IT MEANS TO BE A MAN.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.545
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S ON HIM.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.213
I HEARD MICHA'S
LIKE A DAUGHTER TO YOU.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.748
YOU DON'T WANT HER WITH THAT.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.884
- NO, BUT I TRIED
TO BE THERE FOR HER,

25:17.917 --> 25:20.553
TRY TO SHOW HER TOUGH LOVE, BUT
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN HEADSTRONG.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.088
- SHE GOT ANY FAMILY
CAN GET THROUGH TO HER?

25:22.121 --> 25:25.024
- NO, ALL HER FAMILY, THEY ONLY
CALL WHEN THEY NEED SOMETHING.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.993
MICHA PAYS
FOR ALL THEIR BILLS.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.029
HER MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND--
HE RUNS THAT FAMILY.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.231
HE'S ALSO NOT AFRAID
TO USE HIS FIST EITHER.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.233
- WOW, SHE GREW UP
WITH THAT TOO?

25:34.266 --> 25:37.036
- CALEB WAS TAILOR-MADE FOR HER.
I CAN'T FIGHT IT.

25:37.069 --> 25:39.071
- YEAH.
AND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

25:39.105 --> 25:42.141
TILL HE DOES SOMETHING AGAIN.

25:42.174 --> 25:45.077
KEEP AN EYE ON HER, OKAY?
- I ALWAYS DO.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.946
YOU KNOW, SHE'S HAVING
A BIG RELEASE PARTY

25:46.979 --> 25:49.248
FOR HER SINGLE TONIGHT
WITH CALEB.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.885
IF I CAN GET HER PAST THAT,
MAYBE THE FEVER WILL BREAK.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.023
- LIVE RED CARPET FOOTAGE

25:57.056 --> 25:58.357
FOR THE RELEASE
OF HER NEW SINGLE?

25:58.390 --> 26:01.093
- YOU MEAN
HER AND CALEB'S DUET.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.729
- I GUESS HER PEOPLE
AREN'T WORRIED

26:02.762 --> 26:04.096
ABOUT ANY DAMAGE
TO HER BRAND.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.732
- IF I DIDN'T
KNOW ANY BETTER,

26:05.765 --> 26:06.966
I'D SWEAR THIS WHOLE THING
WAS JUST FOR PUBLICITY.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.101
- WELL, HER TEAM, MAYBE.
HIM, DEFINITELY.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.903
EVERYONE'S USING HER.

26:10.937 --> 26:13.105
BUT THOSE BRUISES ARE REAL.
- SO EXCITED, WENDY.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.642
THE RECORD, THE TOUR...

26:15.675 --> 26:17.644
I JUST FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING'S
COMING TOGETHER FOR ME.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.246
- SPEAKING OF "COMING TOGETHER,"
I SEE YOU'RE WEARING HIS RING.

26:20.279 --> 26:23.315
DOES THIS MEAN THAT
YOU AND CALEB ARE GOOD AGAIN?

26:23.349 --> 26:26.352
- I'VE FORGIVEN CALEB.
WE'VE MOVED PAST WHAT HAPPENED.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.120
BUT THE POLICE
KEEP TARGETING HIM.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.690
THEY WOULDN'T EVEN LET HIM
COME HERE WITH ME TONIGHT.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.291
- WELL, THEY SAY THAT'S
FOR YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.794
- I LOVE CALEB,
AND HE LOVES ME.

26:34.827 --> 26:36.095
THE NEW YORK
POLICE DEPARTMENT

26:36.128 --> 26:38.397
CAN'T TELL ME
WHO I CAN AND CANNOT LOVE.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.066
- WELL, SHE BASICALLY
JUST INVITED HIM.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.234
- WE SHOULD BE ON HIM.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.236
- NICK, BILL OF RIGHTS?
- AND WHAT ABOUT HER RIGHTS?

26:44.270 --> 26:48.140
- BRASS TOLD ME
HE'D KEEP AN EYE OUT.

- LOOKS LIKE A WARZONE IN HERE.
ANY COLLATERAL DAMAGE?

28:15.995 --> 28:19.265
- THE ONLY D.O.A. IS BRASS.
HALF A DOZEN INJURED.

28:19.298 --> 28:20.466
- ANYBODY KNOW HOW
THIS WHOLE THING GOT STARTED?

28:20.499 --> 28:22.268

THAT COULD WALK TOOK OFF.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.003

NOBODY SAW ANYTHING,

28:24.036 --> 28:25.504
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.942
ACCORDING TO HIM,
HE'S NOT HERE.

28:29.976 --> 28:32.244

ON THE FLOOR.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.480
ANYBODY CARRYING
DUMPED AND RAN.

28:34.513 --> 28:37.049

ON REGISTRATION.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.751
- WHAT ABOUT CALEB?

28:38.785 --> 28:40.152
- IF HE WAS HERE,
HE DIDN'T COME IN THE FRONT.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.989
- OH, HE WAS HERE.
I HEARD HIM THREATENING BRASS.

28:43.022 --> 28:45.191
- WELL, WHATEVER
HAPPENED HERE TONIGHT,

28:45.224 --> 28:48.027
MICHA WAS
IN THE CENTER OF IT.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.997
- IT'S YOUR FAULT.
BRASS IS DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.399
- MICHA,
YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.400
- YOU WENT AND TURNED HIM
AGAINST CALEB.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.168
GOT HIM ALL FIRED UP.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.204
- DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED?
DID YOU SEE WHO SHOT BRASS?

28:58.237 --> 28:59.205
- NO.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.973
- MICHA, WHEN WE FOUND YOU,

29:01.007 --> 29:04.877
YOU WERE LAYING UNCONSCIOUS
ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NEAR HIM.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.980
AND YOU'RE TELLING US
THAT YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING?

29:08.014 --> 29:10.950
- NO.

29:10.983 --> 29:13.986
- WAS CALEB AT THE CLUB
LAST NIGHT?

29:14.020 --> 29:15.988
- BRASS TOLD US
HE WAS THERE.

29:16.022 --> 29:18.057
- MICHA.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.092
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE IN SHOCK,

29:20.126 --> 29:22.895
AND I UNDERSTAND
HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS.

29:22.929 --> 29:26.432
BUT IF CALEB KILLED BRASS,
HE NEEDS TO ANSWER FOR THAT.

29:26.465 --> 29:29.335
BRASS HAD A WIFE.

29:29.368 --> 29:34.340
HE HAD A LITTLE BOY.

29:34.373 --> 29:37.176
- NO.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.278
- "YOU CAN COUNT ON ME,
AND I CAN COUNT ON YOU."

29:39.311 --> 29:40.813
IS THAT FROM CALEB?

29:40.847 --> 29:43.149
- SO WHAT IF THEY ARE?

29:43.182 --> 29:44.483
- HE'S ASKING YOU
TO COVER FOR HIM.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.453
- IT'S JUST A LYRIC.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.089
CAN YOU LET ME
GET SOME REST?

29:54.994 --> 29:56.295
- WE'LL TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS,

29:56.328 --> 29:57.830
BUT MY CLIENT
HAS NOTHING TO CONTRIBUTE

29:57.864 --> 29:59.866
ABOUT THIS TRAGIC EVENT.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.267
- DON'T BE SO MODEST.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.902
CALEB, WHAT TIME DID YOU
GET TO THE CLUB LAST NIGHT?

30:02.935 --> 30:04.603
- I WASN'T THERE.

30:04.636 --> 30:07.106
- THE LAUNCH OF YOUR BIG DUET
AND YOU DIDN'T GO.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.341
- I WANTED TO, BUT I CAN'T
GET WITHIN 1,000 YARDS.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.977
- WHERE WERE YOU?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.345
- HOME.
WATCHED A LITTLE TV.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.580
- ANYONE WITH YOU?

30:14.613 --> 30:17.516
- NO.
- WHAT'D YOU WATCH?

30:17.549 --> 30:20.152
- BASKETBALL.
SOME COOKING SHOW.

30:20.186 --> 30:21.988
I CHANNEL SURF.

30:22.021 --> 30:24.023
- OKAY? YOU GOT IT?
- NO, WE DON'T GOT IT.

30:24.056 --> 30:27.526
BRASS CALLED
AND TOLD ME YOU WERE THERE.

30:27.559 --> 30:30.329
- I FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM,

30:30.362 --> 30:32.031
BUT IT WASN'T ME.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.099
- I HEARD YOUR VOICE
ON THE PHONE, CALEB,

30:33.132 --> 30:35.601
IT'S LIKE A FINGERPRINT.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.070
- REALLY?

30:38.104 --> 30:41.540
ON A CELL PHONE?
IN A CROWDED CLUB?

30:41.573 --> 30:45.244
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A NICE TRY.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.021
- SO, HIP-HOP,
HARD-PARTYING LADIES' MAN,

30:55.054 --> 30:56.188
AND LAST NIGHT
WAS THE ONE NIGHT

30:56.222 --> 30:57.990
HE WAS HOME ALONE
WATCHING THE KNICKS.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.225
- YOU HAVEN'T FOUND
ANY WITNESSES

30:59.258 --> 31:01.027
WHO PUT HIM AT THE SCENE?

31:01.060 --> 31:02.661
- WE HAVEN'T FOUND A WITNESS
WHO PUTS HIMSELF AT THE SCENE.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.897
- NOBODY SAW WHO KILLED TUPAC
OR BIGGIE EITHER.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.665
- SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE?

31:06.698 --> 31:08.034
- YEAH, LOOKS LIKE
IT WAS SHOT BY GODARD.

31:08.067 --> 31:09.101
- FORENSICS?

31:09.135 --> 31:10.669
- THE GUN THAT FIRED
THE FATAL SHOT

31:10.702 --> 31:12.338
WAS WIPED CLEAN OF PRINTS,
IT WAS UNREGISTERED,

31:12.371 --> 31:14.573
AND STOLEN FROM A GUN SHOW
SIX YEARS AGO.

31:14.606 --> 31:17.944
- MICHA KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT SHE'S NOT TALKING.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.578
- CALEB HAS A HOLD ON HER.

31:19.611 --> 31:22.614
I MEAN, GOING AGAINST HIM
FEELS IMPOSSIBLE.

31:22.648 --> 31:26.452
BUT SHE DID LOVE BRASS.
THAT WAS REAL.

31:26.485 --> 31:30.022
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.659
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.262
- MICHA.
- JEN.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.533
I'M SO SORRY.

31:44.336 --> 31:48.207
I'M SO, SO SORRY, CURTIS.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.146
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT HE'S GONE.

31:54.180 --> 31:58.517
YESTERDAY HE'S HAVING CHEERIOS
WITH CURTIS, AND TODAY--

31:58.550 --> 32:01.954
- IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I CAN DO--

32:01.988 --> 32:05.324
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENED.

32:05.357 --> 32:09.061
YOU WERE THERE.
DID YOU SEE?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.175
- MS. GREEN.

32:23.209 --> 32:26.112
IF YOU'RE READY.

32:30.016 --> 32:31.483
- I DIDN'T NEED TO SEE THEM.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.452
DID YOU BRING THEM HERE
ON PURPOSE?

32:33.485 --> 32:36.755
- SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF WE HAD
FOUND HER HUSBAND'S KILLER.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.226
WE HAD TO TELL HER
THAT NOBODY WAS TALKING.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.661
- I TOLD YOU
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

32:42.694 --> 32:44.563
NOW, WHERE ARE THOSE PAPERS
I'M SUPPOSED TO SIGN?

32:44.596 --> 32:46.065
- OH, YEAH,
THE, UH, PAPERS

32:46.098 --> 32:48.034
FORMALLY DROPPING
THE CHARGES AGAINST CALEB.

32:48.067 --> 32:52.704
THEY'RE, UH--THEY'RE PRINTING UP
RIGHT NOW. IT WAS A BUSY DAY.

32:52.738 --> 32:56.042
- YOU KNOW, MICHA, WE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

32:56.075 --> 32:59.711
WE THINK THAT BRASS
WAS TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.547
HE WAS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.582
LIKE HE ALWAYS HAS.

33:03.615 --> 33:08.320
YOU KNOW,
I FOUND THE FAMOUS VIDEO.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.723
YOU WERE SINGING.

33:11.757 --> 33:16.162
- * I WILL STAND TALL
- JUST NINE YEARS OLD.

33:16.195 --> 33:19.065
YOUR GRANDMOTHER
SENT THIS TO BRASS.

33:19.098 --> 33:21.633
- I KNOW THE STORY.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.269
- IT MADE IT PAST
ALL OF HIS PEOPLE,

33:23.302 --> 33:25.404
AND HE ENDED UP
WATCHING IT HIMSELF.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.406
THEN YOUR LIFE CHANGED.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.776
- * I WILL STAND TALL...

33:30.809 --> 33:33.745
- IT REALLY HAPPEN LIKE THAT?
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST P.R.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.714
- * YOU CAN COUNT ON ME

33:35.747 --> 33:39.151
- NO, IT'S TRUE.

33:39.185 --> 33:43.822
THAT NIGHT HE CALLED
MY GRANDMOTHER...

33:43.855 --> 33:48.560
SHE WAS SO EXCITED
SHE KEPT DROPPING HER PHONE.

33:48.594 --> 33:52.464
- SO, HE PAID
FOR ALL YOUR VOICE LESSONS?

33:52.498 --> 33:56.468
MADE SURE THAT YOU
STAYED IN SCHOOL?

33:56.502 --> 34:00.472
MADE SURE
THAT YOU WERE...A GOOD GIRL.

34:03.509 --> 34:07.079
AND NOW HIS OWN SON

34:07.113 --> 34:10.849
WON'T HAVE HIM AROUND
TO DO THAT.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.718
- WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO SAY?

34:12.751 --> 34:15.187
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT CALEB.
- ARE WE?

34:15.221 --> 34:19.091
WE KNOW THAT HE WAS
AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT.

34:19.125 --> 34:22.728
- HE JUST WANTED
TO SEE ME.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.530
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:24.563 --> 34:26.665
WHEN WE MET,
IT WAS SO INTENSE.

34:26.698 --> 34:29.435
FLOWERS, GIFTS, TRIPS.

34:29.468 --> 34:32.338
CALEB ALWAYS SAYING
HE LOVED ME.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.340
I FELT LIKE
I'D FOUND MY PRINCE.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.108
- HE WAS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU.

34:36.142 --> 34:39.345
JUST LIKE BRASS DID.

34:39.378 --> 34:42.714
UNTIL IT CHANGED.

34:42.748 --> 34:46.185
IT CHANGED,
DIDN'T IT, MICHA?

34:46.218 --> 34:50.556
YEAH.

34:50.589 --> 34:54.326
- ONE NIGHT...

34:54.360 --> 34:56.895
WE WERE AT A CLUB.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.730
HE GOT A TEXT.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.732
I JUST SAID, "WHO'S THAT?"

35:00.766 --> 35:02.734
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS ANOTHER GIRL.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.437
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO MAKE CONVERSATION.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.474
- AND THEN?

35:08.507 --> 35:11.610
- HE DRAGGED ME
DOWN THE STAIRS.

35:11.643 --> 35:15.847
HE JUST KEPT KICKING ME.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.784
BROKE TWO RIBS.

35:18.817 --> 35:22.821
THE NEXT DAY
HE WAS CRYING LIKE A BABY.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.291
- AND HE SWORE THAT
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN?

35:25.324 --> 35:26.925
- AND HE MEANT IT.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.228
- MICHA...

35:29.261 --> 35:31.497
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

35:38.904 --> 35:41.573
- I TOLD HIM
HE COULDN'T BE THERE.

35:41.607 --> 35:44.876
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO GET IN TROUBLE AGAIN.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.913
BUT THAT JUST
MADE HIM ANGRY.

35:47.946 --> 35:52.451
HE SAID HE'D SEE HIS WOMAN
WHEN HE WANTED TO.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.753
THEN HE SAW BRASS
ON THE PHONE.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.189
- AND WHAT DID HE DO?

35:57.223 --> 35:59.758
- HE WENT OFF.

35:59.791 --> 36:02.928
BRASS TOLD HIM
TO TAKE IT EASY.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.831
BUT THAT JUST GOT HIM
ALL WOUND UP.

36:07.966 --> 36:13.372
TOLD HIM TO STEP OFF,
TO STAY AWAY FROM ME.

36:13.405 --> 36:17.843
BUT BRASS JUST STAYED
IN HIS FACE.

36:17.876 --> 36:21.913
CALEB PULLED A GUN.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.950
HE SHOT BRASS IN THE CHEST.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.525
- OKAY. [sighs]
OKAY.

36:33.559 --> 36:36.928
MICHA, WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO TELL THIS TO THE GRAND JURY

36:36.962 --> 36:41.267
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

36:41.300 --> 36:43.769
- MICHA...

36:43.802 --> 36:47.806
YOU CAN DO THIS.

36:47.839 --> 36:51.710
YOU NEED TO DO THIS.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.879
- YES.

36:56.848 --> 36:59.718
I WILL.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.126
- I SAID GOOD NIGHT
TO HER AT 10:00,

37:08.960 --> 37:10.929
AND I POSTED A UNI
OUTSIDE HER DOOR.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.731
- SHE SEEM SOLID?

37:12.764 --> 37:15.667
- SOLID, I MEAN,
SO FAR SO GOOD, RIGHT?

37:15.701 --> 37:17.503
- MM-HMM.

37:17.536 --> 37:21.507
YOU EVER BEEN
IN LOVE LIKE THAT?

37:21.540 --> 37:23.809
- LIKE THE GUY KILLS SOMEBODY
IN FRONT OF ME,

37:23.842 --> 37:27.513
BUT HE SENDS ME FLOWERS
SO I LET IT SLIDE?

37:27.546 --> 37:30.482
THAT'S NOT LOVE,
THAT'S BRAINWASHING.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.884
- [sighs]
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT...

37:32.918 --> 37:35.721
SHE THINKS SHE'S IN LOVE.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.623
11th GRADE.

37:37.656 --> 37:41.460
LAUREN SULLIVAN.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.329
SHE COULD HAVE MASSACRED
MY ENTIRE FAMILY.

37:43.362 --> 37:45.397
I WOULD'VE LOOKED
THE OTHER WAY.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.934
- 11th GRADE. YOU WERE 17.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.969
- MICHA'S 19.

37:56.542 --> 37:58.644
- IT WAS A PUBLICITY PARTY
FOR MY NEW SINGLE.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.379
A DUET WITH CALEB.

38:00.412 --> 38:03.582
- AND JOHN BLANKEN, KNOWN
AS "BRASS," WAS AT THE PARTY?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.016
- YES.

38:05.050 --> 38:08.687
HE PRODUCED MY RECORD.
HE PRODUCED ALL MY RECORDS.

38:08.720 --> 38:12.958
- AND DID YOU WITNESS
HIS ENCOUNTER WITH CALEB BRYANT?

38:15.794 --> 38:17.563
MS. GREEN.

38:17.596 --> 38:21.099
- UM, CALEB?

38:21.132 --> 38:22.901
HE WASN'T THERE.

38:22.934 --> 38:25.637
- DO--

38:25.671 --> 38:27.773
LET'S GO BACK.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.108
CALEB BRYANT WAS AT THE PARTY.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

38:30.141 --> 38:32.678
- NO, HE WASN'T.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.714
- MS. GREEN...

38:35.747 --> 38:39.618
YESTERDAY EVENING,
YOU SAT IN MY OFFICE,

38:39.651 --> 38:43.088
AND YOU TOLD ME AND A DETECTIVE
ABOUT AN ALTERCATION

38:43.121 --> 38:46.392
THAT YOU WITNESSED AT THE PARTY
BETWEEN BRASS AND CALEB BRYANT.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.126
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

38:48.159 --> 38:50.429
- YOU WERE PRESSURING ME.

38:50.462 --> 38:53.632
YOU AND THAT DETECTIVE
HAVE A VENDETTA AGAINST CALEB.

38:53.665 --> 38:54.800
- DID YOU
OR DID YOU NOT TELL US

38:54.833 --> 38:56.968
THAT YOU SAW CALEB BRYANT
SHOOT BRASS?

38:57.002 --> 39:00.572
- I JUST REPEATED
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

39:00.606 --> 39:02.374
I'VE BEEN CONFUSED
EVER SINCE THAT NIGHT.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.709
I GOT A BAD CONCUSSION.

39:03.742 --> 39:06.111
- YOU SEEMED VERY CLEAR
ABOUT THINGS YESTERDAY.

39:06.144 --> 39:08.079
- YOU PUT WORDS
IN MY MOUTH.

39:08.113 --> 39:09.681
- WELL, THEN GREAT,
TELL US EXACTLY,

39:09.715 --> 39:12.718
IN YOUR OWN WORDS, WHAT YOU SAW
WHEN BRASS WAS MURDERED.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.554
- I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.723
I HEARD A COMMOTION,
AND PEOPLE WERE RUNNING,

39:17.756 --> 39:19.725
AND THEN I GOT
KNOCKED DOWN.

39:19.758 --> 39:21.593
- DO YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE UNDER OATH?

39:21.627 --> 39:24.763
DO YOU REALIZE THAT LYING
TO A GRAND JURY IS A FELONY,

39:24.796 --> 39:27.533
AND IT IS PUNISHABLE
BY A TERM IN STATE PRISON?

39:31.002 --> 39:34.706
- I'M NOT LYING.

39:34.740 --> 39:38.677
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

39:38.710 --> 39:40.045
- SWEAR THEY HAD NO CONTACT?

39:40.078 --> 39:41.046
- HE DID NOT GO UP
TO THAT HOTEL ROOM,

39:41.079 --> 39:42.448
AND SHE DID NOT LEAVE.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.649
- THERE WERE NO EMAILS,
NO TWEETS.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.617
- HE WENT OLD-SCHOOL.
BURNER CELL.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.486
- ONE-HOUR PHONE CALL
TO MICHA'S SUITE LAST NIGHT.

39:47.519 --> 39:48.720
- PROBABLY WHEN SHE TOLD HIM

39:48.754 --> 39:49.788
THAT SHE WAS
GOING TO THE GRAND JURY.

39:49.821 --> 39:51.089
- AND HE SWORE
THAT HE LOVED HER,

39:51.122 --> 39:52.691
AND HE SAID
THAT HE WAS SORRY.

39:52.724 --> 39:54.693
- AND HE COULDN'T LIVE
WITHOUT HER.

39:54.726 --> 39:56.762
HER LATEST TWEET.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.930
SHE WENT STRAIGHT FROM
THE GRAND JURY TO TETERBORO.

39:58.964 --> 40:03.168
PRIVATE JET TO BERMUDA.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.504
- "COUNTING ON EACH OTHER.

40:05.537 --> 40:10.175
LOVE RULES OVER ALL."

40:10.208 --> 40:11.877
- SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

40:11.910 --> 40:15.213
- WE WAIT.
- FOR WHAT?

40:15.246 --> 40:18.784
- THE INEVITABLE.

40:23.021 --> 40:26.157
- THIS BOAT
IS SO BEAUTIFUL, CALEB.
