00:30.924 --> 00:32.061
Now, before we eat,

00:32.073 --> 00:34.368
let's remember what
we're celebrating today--

00:34.541 --> 00:36.625
after many years
of hard work,

00:36.786 --> 00:39.572
your father finally
paid off the mortgage.

00:41.155 --> 00:42.579
See you in Hell, document.

00:44.938 --> 00:47.775
All right, Dad.
- Way to build equity.

00:48.042 --> 00:49.883
Now remember
to eat smart, people.

00:50.075 --> 00:51.028
Go for the fancy foods--

00:51.206 --> 00:53.052
don't let 'em fill you up
with that cheap stuff.

00:54.008 --> 00:55.734
A roll, sir?
- Screw you.

00:55.731 --> 00:56.499
Oatmeal?

00:57.920 --> 01:00.621
Smoked salmon... shrimp...
crab legs.

01:18.088 --> 01:19.295
I win.

01:21.437 --> 01:24.367
Thinner... thinner....

01:26.856 --> 01:27.556
too thin.

01:27.557 --> 01:28.780
Better luck next time,

01:28.934 --> 01:30.575
"Tommy-- Virginia Beach."

01:40.830 --> 01:43.085
You ate meat.
You ate meat.

01:43.255 --> 01:46.158
You ate fruit.
You ate fruit.

01:50.751 --> 01:52.267
Stow it, you two.

01:55.614 --> 01:57.705
Stop making a scene!

02:00.862 --> 02:01.680
How rude.

02:01.895 --> 02:03.988
What do I have to do to
enjoy a Sunday brunch

02:03.989 --> 02:05.706
with my secret
other family?

02:05.794 --> 02:07.645
I've never been
so embarrassed.

02:07.831 --> 02:08.794
And the worst part is,

02:08.979 --> 02:10.244
this is brunch,

02:10.406 --> 02:11.887
so you've ruined two meals.

02:12.099 --> 02:13.749
I'll see you
all at lupper.

02:15.575 --> 02:17.040
Why did I ever have kids?

02:17.252 --> 02:18.933
I could have written symphonies,

02:19.113 --> 02:20.429
or been Shakespeare.

02:21.857 --> 02:22.942
Here, Homer.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.386
Have a big, frosty mug
of Fuhgetaboutit.

02:26.968 --> 02:28.295
I wouldn't drink that.

02:28.557 --> 02:30.847
From the looks of this place,
it might kill you.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.806
Oh, who are you,
the health inspector?

02:32.963 --> 02:33.888
Yes.

02:37.915 --> 02:39.661
My God, look at this filth.

02:39.865 --> 02:41.881
I ought to close this dump
down for good.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.759
But then where would I go
to get away from my wife?

02:45.944 --> 02:49.316
Come here, Moe, you
beautiful, hideous troll.

02:50.528 --> 02:53.360
Guys, this is Frankie from
the Health Department.

02:53.361 --> 02:54.227
We go way back.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.667
Lenny, you don't have
to hide that rat.

02:58.454 --> 02:59.637
Off you go, little fella.

03:00.697 --> 03:01.210
When we were kids,

03:01.398 --> 03:03.881
our dads used to get drunk and
make us fight each other.

03:05.475 --> 03:08.799
My pop would buy me a malted for
every tooth of Moe's I knocked out.

03:08.854 --> 03:11.186
That time you blinded me,
he gave you a bike.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.530
That sure was a
good-soundin' bike...

03:14.649 --> 03:17.605
Well, now to give this place
a "thorough inspection."

03:23.278 --> 03:24.934
Free from infestation?
Check.

03:25.975 --> 03:27.755
Sanitary utensils?
Check.

03:28.468 --> 03:29.635
Food hygienically stored?

03:29.793 --> 03:31.227
Only one way to find out.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.294
Oh my God, he's dead.

03:42.474 --> 03:45.346
Okay, which one of you guys
parked in front of the hydrant?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.699
Uh, look, I didn't see
nothin' here, okay?

03:50.079 --> 03:51.241
Just a bunch of
innocent guys,

03:51.404 --> 03:53.119
sitting around,
none of them dead.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.592
Buy yourselves a nice dinner.

04:03.242 --> 04:05.011
So, uh, Mr. New Guy,

04:05.175 --> 04:05.862
what do you think?

04:06.118 --> 04:08.026
Is everything...
hunky-dory there?

04:08.217 --> 04:08.859
Mr. Szyslak,

04:08.860 --> 04:11.137
your tavern is rife with
Health Code violations.

04:11.308 --> 04:13.384
You gotta be kidding me.
Like what?

04:13.555 --> 04:16.548
For starters, the body of my
predecessor is still on the floor.

04:17.819 --> 04:21.125
Uh, well, ya see, trash day
ain't 'til Wednesday, so...

04:22.914 --> 04:24.503
Chicken skins in soap
dispenser...

04:24.660 --> 04:25.949
cigarette butts in the air...

04:26.123 --> 04:27.158
toilet on the roof...

04:27.321 --> 04:29.960
I'm shutting you down till
you fix these violations.

04:29.979 --> 04:32.409
Oh, man, I can't afford
to fix all that stuff.

04:35.147 --> 04:36.524
Aw, nuts.

04:37.374 --> 04:39.337
If anybody needs me,
I'll be in the john.

04:48.055 --> 04:55.888
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are calling

04:56.577 --> 05:00.046
From glen to glen

05:00.269 --> 05:04.656
And down the mountainside

05:04.879 --> 05:07.412
The summer's gone

05:07.583 --> 05:11.906
and all the roses falling

05:12.140 --> 05:20.127
'Tis you, 'tis you must go
And I must bide.

05:21.508 --> 05:23.763
Moe's, a tribute.

05:23.898 --> 05:26.747
"M" is for Moe,
the owner of Moe's.

05:26.972 --> 05:30.579
"O" is for the "O"
in the middle of Moe's.

05:30.794 --> 05:33.155
"E" is for acceptance.

05:33.485 --> 05:37.043
The feeling I always got here
at Moe's.

05:37.847 --> 05:40.533
Oh, Moe! Don't let them
close you down.

05:41.078 --> 05:41.814
It's too late.

05:41.815 --> 05:43.856
I  don't have the cash
to clean up the bar.

05:44.229 --> 05:44.780
From now on,

05:44.781 --> 05:47.457
you guys are just going to have to
do your drinking across the street.

05:52.279 --> 05:53.487
Hey, a beer's a beer.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.435
I can't go
to a gay bar--

05:57.616 --> 05:59.145
I'm too fat.

05:59.874 --> 06:01.877
Moe, I'm going to help you
reopen your bar,

06:01.878 --> 06:03.215
no matter what it takes.

06:06.409 --> 06:08.460
Mr. Simpson, for
a loan this big,

06:08.635 --> 06:10.576
you'll have to put up
your house as collateral.

06:10.802 --> 06:11.533
Put up my house?

06:11.740 --> 06:13.118
But I just paid it off.

06:13.307 --> 06:14.578
What would Marge say?

06:15.653 --> 06:17.767
Do whatever you have
to do to save Moe's.

06:17.948 --> 06:19.585
I love my Homie.

06:19.746 --> 06:21.888
Okay, honey, I'll do it.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.360
What's going on here?

06:23.537 --> 06:24.892
Nothing. Nothing.

06:28.855 --> 06:29.534
Thanks, Homer.

06:29.712 --> 06:31.179
No one's ever trusted
me before--

06:31.361 --> 06:33.933
except for that one guy
who shouldn't have.

06:34.108 --> 06:34.795
That was me.

06:34.796 --> 06:35.887
Oh, yeah.

06:35.888 --> 06:37.619
Homer, those
kookoo-birds at the bank

06:37.760 --> 06:40.229
goofed up and sent us
a mortgage statement.

06:40.489 --> 06:43.784
Marge! How dare you open a
letter addressed to both of us!

06:43.944 --> 06:48.500
M631700000642J?

06:48.684 --> 06:50.751
This is a new
loan tracking number.

06:50.906 --> 06:52.973
You  got a new mortgage?

06:53.146 --> 06:54.131
I had to.

06:54.398 --> 06:56.301
Or Moe's would stay
closed forever.

06:56.466 --> 06:57.806
You gave the money to Moe?

06:57.988 --> 06:59.596
How's he going
to pay us back?

06:59.780 --> 07:01.876
Look, look.
I can see you're upset.

07:02.008 --> 07:04.035
If you need me,
I'll be at Moe's.

07:04.218 --> 07:05.980
Well, maybe I'll go
to Moe's, too,

07:06.158 --> 07:07.848
seeing as I'm now
part owner.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.546
Marge, you can't go
with me to Moe's.

07:09.736 --> 07:12.498
I mean, how would you like it if
I came with you to your mother's?

07:12.664 --> 07:13.720
I would like it.

07:13.854 --> 07:15.011
You never come
to my mother's.

07:15.190 --> 07:18.392
That's because I hate her.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.129
Until you pay us back,

07:21.291 --> 07:22.684
you're answering to me.

07:22.873 --> 07:24.467
And there's going
to be big changes.

07:25.430 --> 07:26.471
now wait just a minute.

07:26.628 --> 07:29.504
One thing Moe Szyslak has
never had is a partner.

07:29.671 --> 07:33.121
Nor a wife, a friend,
a chum, a casual acquaintance,

07:33.268 --> 07:36.250
a pen pal, a parrot,
a meaningful conversation,

07:36.422 --> 07:38.438
a brief hug or eye contact.

07:40.973 --> 07:42.962
I'm just going to call
the suicide hotline now.

07:47.037 --> 07:48.690
And they've
blocked my number.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.014
Oh, God!

07:58.071 --> 07:59.119
Just made it!

08:01.320 --> 08:03.181
Quittin' time!

08:08.388 --> 08:11.375
Boy, I can't wait to get
my lips around an ice cold...

08:12.175 --> 08:13.123
Marge?

08:13.178 --> 08:15.813
I'm here
protecting our investment.

08:15.973 --> 08:19.109
I'd like you to go home
and make dinner for the kids.

08:19.309 --> 08:21.690
But I don't wanna
take care of the kids.

08:23.508 --> 08:25.244
How many cigars
are they allowed to have?

08:25.398 --> 08:26.811
Bart sleeps
in the microwave, right?

08:26.812 --> 08:28.058
Quit playing dumb.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.728
How many magic beans
should I sell the baby for?

08:30.789 --> 08:31.482
Three?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.260
That's me, jerk-ass Homer.

08:37.171 --> 08:39.035
Come on, go home.

08:41.979 --> 08:46.619
Maybe some cheerier paint would
make this place less of a dive.

08:46.788 --> 08:48.474
Marge, my customers
don't like themselves.

08:48.642 --> 08:50.966
Therefore, they seek
the darkness.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.356
Well... as fabulous
as your regulars are,

08:57.626 --> 09:01.244
a remodel might bring in
a higher class of lush.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.237
Look, I like Moe's
the way it is, all right?

09:03.380 --> 09:05.577
And I ain't changin' it
for any dame, skirt,

09:05.722 --> 09:07.380
Susie-Q or face-macer.

09:07.531 --> 09:09.288
I had a feeling
you'd say that,

09:09.482 --> 09:12.168
so I prepared something
that might help you

09:12.323 --> 09:14.307
change your tune.

09:17.453 --> 09:20.451
This place is a diamond,
but it's trapped in the rough

09:20.707 --> 09:22.214
Yeah, well, the sign
still says "Moe's"

09:22.349 --> 09:23.898
So enough of your guff

09:24.719 --> 09:27.758
Here's my new idea
to sell both beer and grub

09:27.798 --> 09:29.318
We will turn
this filthy dive

09:29.477 --> 09:31.879
Into a proper old-time
British pub

09:32.447 --> 09:34.146
A British whaaa?

09:35.885 --> 09:39.745
Darts and meat pies
And lager in pint glasses

09:39.916 --> 09:44.268
What a classy way
To get drunk off your asses

09:44.506 --> 09:45.247
Hey, hold the phone.

09:45.392 --> 09:48.670
An English pub--
that just might work.

09:48.744 --> 09:50.619
In song...

09:50.815 --> 09:54.330
My bar could be British
Instead of arm-pittish,

09:54.474 --> 09:56.135
so why don't we all...

09:56.156 --> 09:57.367
Eh, screw it.

09:57.384 --> 09:58.821
Let's get renovatin'.

10:02.072 --> 10:05.524
Well, I was thinking more
like drapes and a paint job,

10:05.725 --> 10:07.455
but your idea's good, too.

10:07.587 --> 10:08.202
Thanks.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.980
Pint of ale, my dear?

10:19.024 --> 10:20.240
Well thank you,
Your Honor.

10:20.381 --> 10:22.496
You know, you're
kind of sexy.

10:23.321 --> 10:24.987
That's a deliberate
mis-statement of fact.

10:25.138 --> 10:26.274
But I'll allow it.

10:34.954 --> 10:39.668
My first credit card. Wow,
the numbers are all bumpy-like.

10:46.067 --> 10:48.920
So, Mr. Boswell, what do
you think of the new Moe's?

10:49.185 --> 10:50.594
Marge Simpson and Moe Szyslak,

10:50.775 --> 10:52.997
here's a mash note
to your bangers--

10:53.182 --> 10:56.541
I wish you could
live in me forever.

10:56.796 --> 10:58.167
Thanks, uh, Freakazoid.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.325
I'd  just like to say
that there's one person

11:00.326 --> 11:02.533
to whom I really owe
my newfound success--

11:02.989 --> 11:04.269
Marge  Simpson.

11:04.429 --> 11:05.355
Thanks, Moe.

11:05.643 --> 11:08.302
Dad, Mom's spending more
time at Moe's than you are.

11:08.449 --> 11:09.970
And they seem
awfully chummy.

11:10.148 --> 11:11.523
Just what are you inferring?

11:11.674 --> 11:13.112
I'm not inferring
anything.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.087
You infer.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.214
I imply.

11:15.464 --> 11:16.678
Whew, that's a relief.

11:21.456 --> 11:25.472
Boy, what a night!

11:22.819 --> 11:25.347
Moe showed me how to give
someone the bum's rush.

11:25.504 --> 11:28.667
Here, watch.
Get lost, rummy!

11:31.053 --> 11:33.498
Ah, yes, Detroit-style.
Very nice.

11:33.853 --> 11:37.121
So, you've been at Moe's
every night this week.

11:37.248 --> 11:40.707
I  know, I used to think of Moe as
a scabby, dead-eyed hunchback,

11:40.707 --> 11:43.862
but now that I've gotten
to know him, we kind of bonded.

11:43.994 --> 11:46.506
Bonded?!
How many times?

11:46.662 --> 11:50.048
Homer, Moe and I are
just work friends.

11:50.216 --> 11:53.062
You and I are...
marriage friends.

11:53.253 --> 11:54.042
Thanks, honey.

11:54.043 --> 11:55.774
My mind is completely at ease.

12:02.253 --> 12:03.084
Hey, it's me.

12:03.221 --> 12:04.932
Moe! What's up, partner?

12:05.094 --> 12:07.562
Marge, sorry to call you so late,
but I had a great idea--

12:07.711 --> 12:10.123
put cutesy signs
outside the restrooms

12:10.312 --> 12:12.170
that say "dukes" and "dames"

12:12.323 --> 12:14.128
instead of the ones
we have now that say

12:14.141 --> 12:15.945
"standups" and "sitdowns."

12:15.826 --> 12:17.820
Huh? Tell me honestly--
what do you think?

12:17.821 --> 12:19.837
Ooh, that's a great idea.

12:20.173 --> 12:23.150
Thanks. Wait, are you sure I'm
not interruptin' anything?

12:23.303 --> 12:25.769
Of course not.
I'm in bed with Homer.

12:25.895 --> 12:27.831
Also, I want to go
with the green...

12:28.724 --> 12:32.065
Well, I might as well use
this pucker for something.

12:49.476 --> 12:51.834
Coming this summer
from Dreamworks...

12:53.474 --> 12:54.144
Cards !

12:54.428 --> 12:58.448
52 jokers playing
the game of their lives.

12:58.629 --> 13:00.063
I don't wanna
be a three!

13:00.220 --> 13:01.567
I wanna be a seven!

13:01.724 --> 13:02.521
Shut up, kid.

13:02.585 --> 13:04.341
You're as crazy as an eight,
I'm telling you.

13:04.563 --> 13:06.568
With Eddie Murphy
as the Jack of Clubs.

13:06.730 --> 13:09.847
You don't understand, Officer.
I thought that king was a queen.

13:12.937 --> 13:14.966
This summer,
the house is full,

13:14.967 --> 13:16.702
and the deuces are wild!

13:16.845 --> 13:17.948
In Cards!

13:18.150 --> 13:20.250
Hey, Jack, you
got any twos?

13:20.563 --> 13:22.829
You can't handle the twos!

13:24.201 --> 13:25.230
Oh, Marge,

13:25.405 --> 13:28.735
don't you love it when our
hands meet in the popcorn tub?

13:32.718 --> 13:34.924
Hey, Marge!
- Howdy, partner!

13:35.099 --> 13:36.574
Why don't you sit
next to us?

13:36.764 --> 13:38.042
Hey, Moe.

13:38.043 --> 13:39.375
How do you know about that?

13:39.376 --> 13:41.335
Oh, Marge told me.
We share everything.

13:41.331 --> 13:42.613
You do?

13:43.830 --> 13:45.550
Don't worry.
They're just friends.

13:45.719 --> 13:47.411
There's nothing physical
between them.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.821
Homer, can you hold my
wedding ring for a second?

13:49.961 --> 13:51.506
My finger's itchy.

13:51.670 --> 13:53.960
Uh-oh. I'm gonna have
to work on my marriage.

13:54.118 --> 13:55.725
Or alternatively...

14:01.641 --> 14:02.665
Something wrong, Homer?

14:02.808 --> 14:04.571
Well, I'm worried
about Marge and Moe.

14:04.725 --> 14:06.354
They've developed
an intimate bond

14:06.355 --> 14:08.910
of thoughts and feelings
completely separate from me.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.197
But it's not physical.

14:10.376 --> 14:11.611
So everything's great, right?

14:12.812 --> 14:15.618
Homer, it's time you
learned the sad truth.

14:15.619 --> 14:17.887
Can I learn it at a happy place?

14:21.118 --> 14:23.392
Moe and Marge are having
an "emotional affair."

14:23.582 --> 14:25.299
Although there's
no physical intimacy,

14:25.300 --> 14:26.869
there's a deep
spiritual connection

14:26.870 --> 14:28.377
that threatens
to destroy your marriage.

14:28.378 --> 14:29.966
What do I do?!

14:30.130 --> 14:32.260
Engage her feelings,
become a friend.

14:32.396 --> 14:35.023
Ooh, get her a Life Magazine
from the week she was born.

14:35.221 --> 14:36.830
I'll always treasure mine.

14:39.329 --> 14:41.477
You're absolutely right!

14:41.686 --> 14:43.075
Stop this ride!

14:43.146 --> 14:44.121
You're the boss!

14:50.941 --> 14:52.841
I want to go
again, Daddy!

14:53.770 --> 14:54.500
Daddy?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.692
Marge, my darling!

14:57.012 --> 14:57.916
Thank God you're home!

14:58.045 --> 14:59.796
I've been dying
to hear your feelings!

14:59.981 --> 15:02.293
Oh, I'm too
tired to talk.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.931
Well, I can go
all night, baby.

15:05.075 --> 15:07.193
I could listen to you two,
maybe three times.

15:07.363 --> 15:09.075
Homie, I'm tired.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.383
I have to get up early
to catch my flight.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.456
Catch your flight?

15:13.890 --> 15:16.899
Moe and I are going to the
Tavern and Restaurant Owners

15:17.050 --> 15:19.039
Convention in Aruba
this weekend.

15:19.414 --> 15:20.805
Don't you ever
listen to me?

15:21.006 --> 15:22.249
I told you ten times.

15:29.683 --> 15:31.964
Cuckold! Cuckold! Cuckold!

15:31.965 --> 15:33.440
What's a cuckold?

15:48.024 --> 15:49.427
Where's Mom going
with Uncle Moe?

15:49.594 --> 15:51.215
He's only
your emotional uncle!

15:51.355 --> 15:52.450
I'm your real uncle!

15:52.609 --> 15:54.542
Well, if Hollywood movies
have taught us anything,

15:54.683 --> 15:57.580
it's that troubled relationships
can be completely patched up

15:57.736 --> 15:59.303
by a mad dash to the airport.

15:59.350 --> 15:59.998
I'm off!

16:00.841 --> 16:03.633
Folks, welcome to No Frills
Airlines' flight to Aruba.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.907
Safety instructions
are two dollars.

16:06.057 --> 16:07.925
If you require
wheelchair assistance,

16:08.074 --> 16:09.834
you picked the wrong airline.

16:13.696 --> 16:16.849
Uh, you know, Marge, I've really
enjoyed you working at the bar.

16:17.013 --> 16:18.517
Me, too, Moe.

16:18.658 --> 16:21.103
What a nice surprise
that we've become friends.

16:22.578 --> 16:25.202
Yeah.  Oh, Marge, I'm
so in love with you.

16:25.367 --> 16:25.967
And tonight,

16:26.099 --> 16:28.638
after some surf 'n' turf
and a bottle of champagne,

16:28.801 --> 16:30.295
maybe some Snickers pie,
I'll explain how the hotel

16:30.413 --> 16:32.837
I'll explain how the hotel
made a little "mistake"

16:32.975 --> 16:34.892
and we got to stay
in the same room.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.690
Moe, your upper lip
is trembling.

16:40.530 --> 16:41.908
Oh, I'm just excited
because they're showing

16:42.040 --> 16:44.488
an episode of Boy Meets
World on this flight.

16:44.648 --> 16:46.658
Oh no, wait. That's only
on flights from Europe.

16:46.660 --> 16:48.018
We just get that
little plane.

16:49.089 --> 16:50.500
Hey, wait a minute.
What the hell is that?

16:54.399 --> 16:56.499
Hang on, Marge! Homie's coming!

16:56.703 --> 16:58.954
I won't let that man
make you happy!

17:02.140 --> 17:04.884
Simpson, you were going
a hundred in a 25 zone,

17:05.089 --> 17:07.368
and you're not gonna flirt
your way outta this one.

17:07.369 --> 17:09.993
But I have to get to the airport
to save my marriage!

17:10.159 --> 17:12.532
Really? Well,
why didn't you say so?

17:12.579 --> 17:13.492
Let's roll!

17:13.492 --> 17:15.805
You didn't work this hard
to save my marriage.

17:15.964 --> 17:18.049
Again with that.
Wake up, Lou.

17:18.077 --> 17:19.358
She was way out
of your league.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.085
Flight attendants,
prepare for takeoff.

17:28.927 --> 17:31.465
Time for some shuba-duba
in Aruba.

17:34.842 --> 17:35.981
Oh, my God!

17:35.982 --> 17:38.388
Moe, did you see something
troubling on the tarmac?

17:38.595 --> 17:39.735
No. Why do you say that?

17:42.256 --> 17:45.216
You got to get me closer, Chief!

17:45.447 --> 17:46.687
Anything for love!

17:50.324 --> 17:53.385
Okay, time to chase this pig
into the sty.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.440
Uh, Marge, you deserve
a man who listens to you,

17:56.441 --> 18:00.459
who respects you, who understands
what a treasure you really are.

18:00.466 --> 18:02.055
I don't know what to say.

18:02.354 --> 18:03.735
Just say you
love me, Marge.

18:03.898 --> 18:06.716
Love me like I
love you. Please?

18:09.138 --> 18:10.594
Marge...!

18:10.805 --> 18:12.346
That sounds like Homer.

18:12.495 --> 18:15.068
No it isn't. I don't hear nothin'. You're
crazy. Get outta here. Will you marry me?

18:16.803 --> 18:17.453
Homer!

18:17.603 --> 18:18.727
How'd you get in here?

18:18.891 --> 18:19.681
Toilet hole.

18:21.149 --> 18:23.383
You leave my wife alone!
- You don't deserve her!

18:23.384 --> 18:24.582
You know nothing about Marge.

18:24.741 --> 18:25.774
What's her favorite food?

18:27.068 --> 18:27.888
Ice?

18:28.063 --> 18:29.723
Wrong! It's buttered noodles.

18:29.885 --> 18:31.006
He's right.

18:31.157 --> 18:33.179
Oh, it's true.
I don't know Marge at all.

18:33.970 --> 18:35.344
I'll just go home now.

18:40.331 --> 18:41.825
Shut it! Shut it!

18:45.215 --> 18:47.196
Moe, you've won.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.340
I'll see you
at baggage claim.

18:49.524 --> 18:50.435
Hot damn, I won!

18:50.588 --> 18:53.353
Marge, I swear I'll be
the best man you ever had.

18:53.524 --> 18:55.814
It's gonna be all
flowers and back rubs

18:55.996 --> 18:57.970
and "How was your
day, dear?" and...

18:58.163 --> 19:00.440
Moe! No, I don't love you.

19:00.621 --> 19:03.180
And I'm certainly not going
to leave my husband.

19:03.181 --> 19:06.419
You mean I listened to all your
touchy-feely yip-yap for nothing?

19:06.436 --> 19:07.580
I'm afraid so.

19:07.739 --> 19:10.998
At least I had a couple of sips from your
Coke when you went to the bathroom.

19:12.475 --> 19:13.344
Homie...

19:14.166 --> 19:16.236
Marge, I just want to say,

19:16.400 --> 19:18.248
if you ever feel
like cheating on Moe,

19:18.413 --> 19:19.481
here's my card.

19:21.370 --> 19:24.849
Homer, I made a vow on our
wedding day to stay by you,

19:25.019 --> 19:25.898
for better or worse.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.778
And besides, I love you.

19:29.062 --> 19:31.316
You're my Homie-womie-
romie-domie.

19:31.632 --> 19:37.395
And you're my Margie-wargie-bargie
fargie-gargie-margie-targie-largie.

19:38.174 --> 19:39.862
I may have dodged a bullet here.

19:43.346 --> 19:45.850
Might as well face it,
I'll never find anyone.

19:45.955 --> 19:47.819
Come  on tide, take me with ya.

19:48.008 --> 19:50.286
I just don't want to feel
no more pain.

19:56.495 --> 19:58.462
Moe, I need
to tell you something.

20:01.423 --> 20:03.956
You showed me you could be
a really sweet guy.

20:04.221 --> 20:07.113
You can make a woman
very happy someday.

20:07.944 --> 20:08.958
For realsies?

20:09.203 --> 20:10.156
It's true.

20:10.326 --> 20:11.534
You'd be quite a catch...

20:11.774 --> 20:13.570
if you'd just shower and shave

20:13.571 --> 20:15.631
and stop swearing
under your breath.

20:15.911 --> 20:17.370
Aw, thanks, Marge.

20:17.778 --> 20:19.341
Know-it-all bitch.

20:19.672 --> 20:23.120
Oh, uh, did I mention there was
a mistake at the front desk?

20:24.191 --> 20:24.702
Really?

20:24.958 --> 20:27.701
Is it one that will change
the sleeping arrangements?

20:27.926 --> 20:29.850
Could be. Could be.

20:31.051 --> 20:33.733
Listen, I got to tell you,
I chew in my sleep.

20:33.922 --> 20:35.310
Yeah, well,
I sweat blood.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.079
Good night, both of you.

20:39.896 --> 20:41.149
Who's watching the kids?

20:41.353 --> 20:45.677
Are you sure Mom and Dad want us
to enter a European balloon race?

20:45.890 --> 20:47.344
Sure. Why not?

20:56.954 --> 20:58.171
Love,

20:58.382 --> 21:01.067
Love will keep us together

21:02.213 --> 21:04.766
Think of me, babe,
whenever

21:05.967 --> 21:09.006
Some sweet-talking guy
in a thong

21:09.770 --> 21:11.091
Hands you a bong

21:11.633 --> 21:12.982
Don't take a hit

21:12.982 --> 21:15.729
You just got to be strong
- You better stop

21:16.789 --> 21:19.515
'Cause I want a sandwich
-  I said stop

21:20.347 --> 21:22.681
Or maybe
a Manwich...
