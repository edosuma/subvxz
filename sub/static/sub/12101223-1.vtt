00:32.176 --> 00:35.846
Today is a day of reckoning.

00:41.102 --> 00:43.521
Beast, beast, ready to act.

00:43.604 --> 00:45.981
Beast, beast, ready to act.

00:46.065 --> 00:48.401
Beast, beast, ready to act.

01:11.090 --> 01:13.008
- Are you ready, dude?
- Yeah.

01:13.092 --> 01:14.927
Here it goes. I'm so psyched.

01:15.010 --> 01:16.262
Let's do this.

01:20.266 --> 01:21.809
We're gonna be shooting left high

01:21.892 --> 01:23.686
and then bottom right.

01:23.811 --> 01:26.105
We're gonna alternate from
the left side to the right,

01:26.147 --> 01:28.607
on either side of this string right here.

01:28.691 --> 01:30.609
Okay. All right. Go.

01:30.693 --> 01:33.112
Hi, I'm Krista Zhang and I'm
reading for the part of Caroline.

01:33.154 --> 01:34.155
Do it again. Do it again.

01:35.823 --> 01:37.283
Wait, that was really dumb.

01:40.911 --> 01:42.538
If you're angry or
upset, put the guns down,

01:42.580 --> 01:43.748
take a break for a minute.

01:43.831 --> 01:45.124
It's a rule of mine to not fire

01:45.249 --> 01:46.625
when you're in an emotional state.

01:54.008 --> 01:56.260
And you find out they're just sad

01:56.302 --> 01:58.262
and mixed up like everybody else.

02:01.891 --> 02:03.392
You can't ever. Not ever in this life.

02:03.559 --> 02:05.478
She's a child, you cannot ever!

02:10.149 --> 02:11.275
Yes!

02:57.530 --> 02:59.031
- Sorry.
- You're fine.

02:59.114 --> 03:01.116
I've got these long arms.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.327
- Krista?
- Yeah. What? What?

03:03.410 --> 03:04.954
- How about these though? Yeah?
- Yes.

03:05.037 --> 03:06.247
Yeah?

03:07.456 --> 03:09.375
Hey, lady. You ready?

03:09.458 --> 03:12.253
- Uh, yeah. One second.
- Hmm.

03:12.336 --> 03:14.211
Uh-hmm.

03:14.213 --> 03:15.172
Stop!

03:16.215 --> 03:17.633
You're the worst.

03:25.224 --> 03:27.059
It's a sunny day.

03:28.686 --> 03:31.814
Birds are chirping.

03:31.939 --> 03:34.358
We're all friendly in the village.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.943
That's fine.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.947
It's an exciting time.

03:39.989 --> 03:42.575
You got new sneakers.

03:42.658 --> 03:47.496
Suddenly, you're aliens...

03:47.663 --> 03:49.832
all from different planets.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.460
Everyone is strange and new.

03:56.881 --> 03:59.675
"Don't bring that into the theatre!"

04:00.134 --> 04:05.097
No. It is our job to
bring it into the theatre.

04:05.180 --> 04:07.850
Out there we don't always have permission

04:07.975 --> 04:11.520
to show what we feel or
say what we wanna say.

04:11.687 --> 04:14.148
Krista, you said it nicely the other day.

04:14.273 --> 04:16.317
- "We're here to show"...
- Oh, uh, we're here to show

04:16.400 --> 04:18.193
the audience what they can do.

04:18.277 --> 04:19.528
Great.

04:19.695 --> 04:21.280
It doesn't always make sense

04:21.322 --> 04:22.489
what humans do.

04:22.573 --> 04:23.574
We're erratic.

04:23.699 --> 04:29.830
But at least here, we open
it up. Expose it. Right?

04:30.706 --> 04:31.415
You're so smart.

04:31.457 --> 04:34.418
Now, Erin, take that
gesture again, with Joel.

04:48.432 --> 04:49.725
All right. Later, skater.

04:49.808 --> 04:51.226
Thanks for walking me home.

04:51.310 --> 04:53.312
- Bye.
- Love you.

04:57.107 --> 04:58.484
What's up, Nick?

04:58.567 --> 05:01.153
- Yo, your truck's leaking.
- What?

05:01.236 --> 05:02.738
Your truck's leaking oil, dude.

05:02.821 --> 05:04.531
What?

05:04.657 --> 05:06.116
Yeah, it's leaking all
over your driveway, man.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.827
Your stepdad's gonna be pissed.

05:18.087 --> 05:19.755
Whoa.

05:31.225 --> 05:33.686
So, there gonna be any girls in this video?

05:33.769 --> 05:35.270
No.

05:35.354 --> 05:37.606
It's not really that kind of thing.

05:37.773 --> 05:39.066
Unless you count.

05:39.108 --> 05:40.526
-Cute.

05:49.076 --> 05:50.619
Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude, stop.

05:50.786 --> 05:52.621
- Stop it. Dude.
- What?

05:52.788 --> 05:54.498
The road is like right over there, man.

05:54.581 --> 05:56.375
- Put the safety on.
- How do you do that?

05:56.417 --> 05:58.085
Don't, don't.

05:58.127 --> 05:59.378
Come on, man.

06:02.506 --> 06:04.633
So I guess we're not
having any fun today, huh?

06:06.135 --> 06:07.302
Can you just set the camera up, please,

06:07.386 --> 06:09.096
without killing anybody?

06:10.806 --> 06:13.851
You gotta be more badass, man.

06:13.934 --> 06:16.020
That's how you get
people to watch your shit.

06:16.103 --> 06:17.730
Oh, yeah?

06:17.813 --> 06:19.189
You know all about it?

06:19.273 --> 06:21.817
- I'm just saying, you know.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.319
- We can have some, like, music, like slow
-mo,

06:24.403 --> 06:26.238
-like maybe put some explosions.

06:26.321 --> 06:27.948
-You know, some cool shit.

06:28.032 --> 06:29.867
Well, on the next video we
can put some explosions in it,

06:29.950 --> 06:32.161
- how's that?
- Yes.

06:32.244 --> 06:33.537
All right. Let's do it.

06:35.164 --> 06:36.749
- All right.
- This is the one, man.

06:36.832 --> 06:38.542
This is... I think this
is gonna be the one.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.753
We're not gonna do one,
we're gonna do a whole bunch.

06:40.836 --> 06:42.421
- Okay.
- Cool.

06:43.422 --> 06:46.425
Think 10 million views.

06:46.550 --> 06:47.593
All right. Here we go.

06:47.676 --> 06:48.886
Okay.

06:54.975 --> 06:56.435
Hey, y'all.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.604
Today we're gonna be demoing some shotguns.

06:58.687 --> 07:02.316
Now, this one is a 12-gauge and...

07:02.441 --> 07:04.151
Is the camera, like, tilted down?

07:04.193 --> 07:05.569
No, it's fine.

07:05.611 --> 07:08.280
Make sure that it could see my whole...

07:35.474 --> 07:37.226
You watching girls on video?

07:38.602 --> 07:39.895
She's cute.

07:39.978 --> 07:42.106
I need my phone back.

07:42.189 --> 07:45.692
Listen, why don't you
go outside and meet some?

07:45.818 --> 07:49.279
It's so stuffy in here. Come on, man.

07:49.363 --> 07:51.198
Oh, and hey, I'm having
company over tonight,

07:51.240 --> 07:53.200
so don't be around, huh?

08:20.018 --> 08:22.104
It's not my fault. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:22.229 --> 08:23.105
You're the one who told
me you were gonna do it.

08:23.230 --> 08:24.648
Never mind. Fuck it.

08:24.690 --> 08:26.108
Did you just take my fucking cigarettes?

08:26.233 --> 08:27.734
No. What are you talking
about? I basically bought these.

08:27.818 --> 08:28.944
Mom's gonna kill you if you're not here.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.238
- Give me one of those at least.
- There's only a couple left.

08:31.280 --> 08:33.991
- Oh, you asshole.
- Yo, new guy, you want a cigarette?

08:34.074 --> 08:36.535
Oh, okay. Have fun with this dick.

08:36.577 --> 08:38.287
Fuck you.

08:38.370 --> 08:40.289
There's plenty more in
there, don't worry about it.

08:40.372 --> 08:41.456
Here. Take it.

08:41.540 --> 08:42.666
Yeah. Thanks.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.334
Come on.

08:59.266 --> 09:01.268
Can you do a kick flip?

09:01.310 --> 09:02.394
Yeah.

09:13.322 --> 09:15.282
Damn, dude.

09:15.324 --> 09:16.700
Shit.

09:16.742 --> 09:20.204
I used to skate back
in, like, middle school.

09:20.287 --> 09:21.705
- You wanna try?
- No, bro.

09:21.747 --> 09:23.123
I'd bust my ass now.

09:23.207 --> 09:25.083
Come on, just push around a little.

09:27.711 --> 09:28.754
All right.

09:33.217 --> 09:34.468
There you go. Natural, man.

09:34.593 --> 09:36.303
Shut the fuck up, bro.

09:39.723 --> 09:41.225
It's loud around here, huh?

09:41.308 --> 09:42.935
Yeah, bro.

09:43.018 --> 09:44.937
You should be in my place
with my mom and my sisters.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.314
It's like an echo chamber of bitching.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.441
You go to high school?

09:49.858 --> 09:51.026
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:51.068 --> 09:52.819
Panthers.

09:52.945 --> 09:54.529
I used to be a Panther.

09:54.613 --> 09:56.865
Oh.

09:57.032 --> 09:59.534
I was the valedictorian.

09:59.618 --> 10:00.786
Really?

10:00.869 --> 10:02.454
Nah, bro, are you fucking kidding me?

10:03.747 --> 10:04.915
Oh, shit, that's me.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.625
Hey, thanks for the skate, man.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.210
Yeah. Hey, thanks for this.

10:08.335 --> 10:10.629
Yeah.

10:10.671 --> 10:13.340
You just fucking doing
this all night or what?

10:13.382 --> 10:14.549
Yup.

10:14.633 --> 10:16.510
Because I'm about to kick it
with my cousin for a little bit

10:16.635 --> 10:18.887
but we're gonna end up at a
party later if you wanna come.

10:19.054 --> 10:20.347
I can get you the address.

10:20.389 --> 10:21.848
- Yeah. Cool.
- Yeah?

10:21.974 --> 10:23.558
- Yeah.
- All right. Take my number.

10:23.642 --> 10:24.810
Uh, yeah. I'll give you mine.

10:24.893 --> 10:26.144
All right.

10:27.396 --> 10:28.647
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cool it.

10:28.772 --> 10:30.148
All right, just text, don't call.

10:30.232 --> 10:31.775
All right. Cool.

10:31.817 --> 10:34.152
Take it easy.

10:34.236 --> 10:35.779
Nito.

10:35.862 --> 10:37.072
All right.

10:37.155 --> 10:38.824
Yeah, fuck you too. Fuck you.

10:38.949 --> 10:40.242
You want some?

10:56.133 --> 10:57.384
Too many leaves.

10:57.426 --> 10:58.927
Who cares about leaves?

10:59.094 --> 11:00.387
I actually do.

11:05.017 --> 11:06.518
- Let's do one more.
- Okay.

11:12.399 --> 11:13.608
"Art washes from the soul

11:13.692 --> 11:16.403
the dust of everyday life."

11:16.445 --> 11:17.821
How about this one?

11:17.904 --> 11:19.406
"Go to your bosom, knock there,

11:19.448 --> 11:21.616
and ask your heart what it doth know."

11:21.700 --> 11:23.702
- Yeah, that's good too.
- It's Shakespeare.

11:23.744 --> 11:27.331
Duh. Dinner is served, my dear.

11:27.414 --> 11:29.416
Thank you. This is like for my backpack

11:29.458 --> 11:31.835
or something, you know, like a mantra.

11:34.755 --> 11:37.132
Brandi Nichols.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.134
Did you see that picture
she posted from regionals?

11:39.217 --> 11:40.927
I didn't.

11:41.053 --> 11:42.888
Uh, fuck off.

11:42.971 --> 11:44.473
Maybe that could be your mantra.

11:44.556 --> 11:46.141
Hey. What did you just say?

11:46.224 --> 11:47.726
Maybe that could be your mantra.

11:47.851 --> 11:49.728
What, "Fuck off, Brandi Nichols"?

11:49.853 --> 11:53.440
- Yeah.
- I kind of like it.

11:53.482 --> 11:54.858
What's yours?

11:59.196 --> 12:01.531
"Things work themselves out."

12:03.325 --> 12:05.369
- What?
- Boring.

12:05.452 --> 12:07.496
No, it's not. I think it's perfect.

12:07.579 --> 12:09.164
I think mine is bett...

12:18.882 --> 12:22.469
Did you put on lipstick before
brushing your teeth again?

12:22.552 --> 12:24.679
-All right, genius.

12:26.306 --> 12:27.349
Phony.

12:27.391 --> 12:29.851
- Erica just texted, she's gonna be late.

12:31.186 --> 12:32.813
What'd you tell your
parents you're doing tonight?

12:32.896 --> 12:34.606
I don't know. Nothing.

12:34.689 --> 12:37.109
Like all of a sudden we're
gonna start talking about stuff.

12:37.192 --> 12:39.027
Where are they right now? Are they home?

12:41.530 --> 12:43.907
- Asleep probably.
- Asleep right now?

12:43.990 --> 12:46.910
It's like 8:30. That's weird.

12:46.993 --> 12:50.539
I don't think I've ever
gone to bed at 8:30.

12:50.622 --> 12:52.207
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

12:52.290 --> 12:53.917
- Krista, come here.
- What? What?

12:53.959 --> 12:55.836
I just found this video of the new kid.

12:55.919 --> 12:57.421
- Who?
- Locker boy.

12:57.504 --> 13:00.340
You know who I'm talking about. Come here.

13:00.424 --> 13:02.926
- Come here.
- What? What?

13:02.968 --> 13:04.511
Okay, ready?

13:10.350 --> 13:12.102
What was that?

13:12.477 --> 13:14.312
Wait, that was actually kind of sick.

13:15.605 --> 13:16.940
All right.

13:17.023 --> 13:18.400
Dude, there's a car. Oh, it's a...

13:18.525 --> 13:20.235
- That's a bus.
- That's crazy.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.821
- No.
- No way.

13:22.863 --> 13:24.698
Actually, though...

15:26.653 --> 15:29.364
Not bye, just give me a
minute, I'm almost done.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.782
Don't mind me.

15:30.865 --> 15:32.951
I'm just trying to keep the house in order.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.207
All right, thanks for
watching another episode

15:39.374 --> 15:40.667
of Prime Shooter.

15:40.709 --> 15:42.294
Make sure to subscribe

15:42.377 --> 15:44.379

15:45.797 --> 15:47.674
- What? What?
- Hey, Dad. Can I see your phone?

15:47.757 --> 15:49.509
Not now, man. Please.

15:49.593 --> 15:51.678
Can I see it for a second?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.389
Go away, man. Come on.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.849
I gotta check something.

15:55.974 --> 15:57.475
You said you'd buy me a new one.

15:57.559 --> 16:00.520
Stop knocking on this bedroom door now.

18:14.738 --> 18:15.613
All right, all right.

18:15.697 --> 18:17.323
What's up? How's it going?

18:17.449 --> 18:19.117
Are you coming home with me?

18:19.159 --> 18:20.368
- Sorry.
- Yeah?

18:20.535 --> 18:21.703
Not a way to impress a girl, dude.

18:21.828 --> 18:22.954
- Hey, chill.
- Go away.

18:23.037 --> 18:24.122
Nobody likes you, dude.

18:24.247 --> 18:25.290
- Don't you wanna fuck?
- Nope.

18:25.373 --> 18:26.958
Back up.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.126
Fuck off, buddy.

18:28.251 --> 18:30.128
Back the fuck up.

18:30.170 --> 18:31.254
Get your friend.

18:31.337 --> 18:32.547
You can have it, bitch.

18:32.630 --> 18:34.132
- Fuck off.
- Fuck you.

18:34.257 --> 18:35.717
Thank you, asshole.

18:35.842 --> 18:37.886
Get out of here. Come on.

18:40.013 --> 18:41.347
It's okay. We're gonna have fun.

18:41.473 --> 18:45.143
We're gonna have fun, we're gonna have fun.

18:49.898 --> 18:51.566
Anyways. We'll have a good night.

18:51.608 --> 18:52.859
It's fine.

18:52.901 --> 18:56.029
Oh, hey. What? You're here.

18:56.154 --> 18:58.281
I saw your friend in there,
with the cool glasses?

18:58.323 --> 19:00.158
Erica, yeah, yeah, she's killin' it right?

19:00.283 --> 19:02.285
Oh, my God. We watched your videos earlier.

19:02.327 --> 19:03.411
This is the guy you were talking about?

19:03.578 --> 19:04.662
Congratulations.

19:04.746 --> 19:06.414
Yeah, your videos are awesome.

19:06.581 --> 19:07.874
- Actually.
- They're amazing.

19:07.916 --> 19:10.585
Guys, this is, uh, Nito.

19:10.668 --> 19:12.587
So, this is Cody, this is Johanna,

19:12.670 --> 19:14.881
and Jazmine, and Silva.

19:14.923 --> 19:17.342
You guys are all actors?

19:17.425 --> 19:19.219
Krista here is our guiding light.

19:19.302 --> 19:20.512
- Shut up.
- You know you are.

19:20.595 --> 19:22.430
She's been acting the
longest, like, she was a kid

19:22.597 --> 19:24.098
acting like a gangster.
And like, she was in her...

19:24.182 --> 19:25.350
- No, we don't...
- No.

19:25.433 --> 19:26.893
She was in her neighborhood's videos,

19:26.935 --> 19:29.103
and she was always, like,
the star of them all.

19:29.187 --> 19:30.647
Did you say there were more of those?

19:30.730 --> 19:32.190
No, I did not say...

19:32.232 --> 19:35.068
I've been trying to get
those videos from you forever.

19:35.193 --> 19:36.361
- And you still...
- What?

19:36.444 --> 19:37.612
I don't even know if he has them.

19:37.654 --> 19:38.905
I don't know where they are.

19:38.947 --> 19:40.657
She's, like, really good.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.367
Okay. Can we all just turn around now?

19:42.450 --> 19:43.827
I think, yeah.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.620
I took it down but we can get over it.

19:45.703 --> 19:46.996
We can go dance.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.790
Do you wanna set this down here?

19:51.918 --> 19:53.545
Come, on. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

19:57.215 --> 19:59.384
- You wanna go dance?
- Uh, no.

19:59.509 --> 20:00.969
- No?
- No.

20:08.017 --> 20:11.062
Oh, yo.

20:11.145 --> 20:13.940
- You made it, bro.
- Yeah, it's rad.

20:13.982 --> 20:15.358
You having a good time?

21:04.699 --> 21:06.034
Yo, cops out front.

21:06.117 --> 21:09.704
- Cops out front!
- Cops! Cops! Cops!

21:19.339 --> 21:21.507
Let go!

21:21.633 --> 21:23.343
Let go!

21:23.551 --> 21:25.178
Krista! Krista!

21:27.180 --> 21:28.723
Get off me.

21:32.352 --> 21:34.479
Stop.

21:34.562 --> 21:37.023
- Get off.
- Hey! Hey, get off her!

21:41.444 --> 21:43.821
- Keep going! Go!
- No!

21:44.072 --> 21:46.449
Slow down, fucker.

21:50.453 --> 21:52.330
Yo! Stop.

21:53.539 --> 21:54.958
No, hey.

21:55.041 --> 21:57.210
Hey, that's my boy.

21:57.335 --> 21:59.337
You're fucked, bro!

22:02.048 --> 22:03.466
Let me go!

22:05.468 --> 22:06.886
Hey, everybody, out.

22:06.970 --> 22:08.930
Hey. Hey!

22:09.055 --> 22:10.056
Get on the ground, now.

22:10.139 --> 22:12.684
Get on the ground, right now.

22:12.767 --> 22:14.268
Get out. Out.

22:14.352 --> 22:15.853
Out!

22:15.937 --> 22:17.605
Stop resisting.

22:17.772 --> 22:19.691
Keep your hands behind your back
and do not fucking move, man.

22:19.774 --> 22:21.067
You are not helping yourself out.

22:40.003 --> 22:44.882
It's sort of her birthday gift
for the next 10 years, yeah?

22:44.966 --> 22:46.801
Birthday, anniversary, Christmas.

22:48.011 --> 22:51.806
So Mabel, how are things
at good old Curtis Clothing?

22:51.848 --> 22:52.849
Oh, well...

22:52.932 --> 22:56.561
I'm kind of ruing the day
I agreed to be manager.

22:56.644 --> 22:58.187
No, it's fine.

22:58.271 --> 23:01.107
Smoke breaks, they all now vape,

23:01.149 --> 23:04.193
but they don't understand that
you need to go outside to do it.

23:04.277 --> 23:06.029
Some things never change.

23:07.405 --> 23:09.115
So, Adam.

23:09.198 --> 23:11.409
Are you still at Randall's,
doing a few days a week?

23:12.869 --> 23:14.996
Uh, no, actually.

23:15.121 --> 23:17.457
Sir, no, I'm finished with that now.

23:17.540 --> 23:19.208
It was a hassle to get over there.

23:19.292 --> 23:22.545
I told you you could use the
truck if you kept on there.

23:22.587 --> 23:26.257
Well, I'm actually gonna be
committing more time to my show.

23:26.340 --> 23:28.342
So, what about work then?

23:28.426 --> 23:32.221
Well, there's money in
it, with ads and stuff.

23:32.305 --> 23:33.556
Yeah, the more people watch,

23:33.598 --> 23:35.141
the more money comes in.

23:35.224 --> 23:37.560
And some people get really
good sponsorships from,

23:37.602 --> 23:39.145
you know, manufacturers.

23:39.187 --> 23:40.354
So, this is a history show

23:40.438 --> 23:43.483
where you're teaching
people about wars and things?

23:43.566 --> 23:45.485
Well, it's just weapons.

23:45.568 --> 23:47.445
Like, the technical side of weapons.

23:47.487 --> 23:49.280
It's, like, what kind
of firearms can do what

23:49.363 --> 23:51.282
and where you can get 'em.

23:51.365 --> 23:53.576
How to modify 'em.

23:53.618 --> 23:55.328
I review new products too.

23:55.453 --> 23:56.704
So, there are people

23:56.871 --> 23:58.498
who like to watch this sort of thing?

23:58.581 --> 24:00.166
A lot of people try to make their videos,

24:00.208 --> 24:01.626
like, flashy and cool but I think

24:01.709 --> 24:03.878
that gives people the wrong idea.

24:03.920 --> 24:06.172
So, so, I try to do mine

24:06.214 --> 24:08.174
with some more integrity.

24:08.216 --> 24:11.177
You know, growing up, I tried
to teach him what I could,

24:11.219 --> 24:12.386
hunting and stuff.

24:12.470 --> 24:13.971
Safe shooting.

24:14.055 --> 24:17.725
But I never expected it to turn
into a website show like this.

24:17.809 --> 24:19.227
So, it's hunting, huh?

24:19.310 --> 24:20.937
Well, maybe you give me a little advice.

24:21.020 --> 24:22.188
- I've got this...
- Well, it's act...

24:22.230 --> 24:23.898
it's not just hunting.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.734
- No, it's, um, protection.
- Oh, sure.

24:26.901 --> 24:29.070
Protecting yourselves here in Wakes County.

24:29.195 --> 24:30.404
Maybe a dog got loose

24:30.488 --> 24:31.948
or you have to shoot
your mother-in-law

24:32.031 --> 24:33.908
because she stayed too long.

24:33.950 --> 24:35.409
You don't know that though.

24:35.493 --> 24:37.203
I mean, right down there on 54,

24:37.245 --> 24:39.914
last year, you remember that?

24:39.997 --> 24:44.627
The man got shot at the gas
station. Just pumping gas.

24:44.669 --> 24:47.338
- They said that was all gang stuff though.
- Paranoia.

24:47.421 --> 24:49.298
I don't think we have to
worry too much about that.

24:49.382 --> 24:53.010
Well, what's gonna stop
them from coming here, hmm?

24:54.720 --> 24:57.932
I think it's a nice
thing you're doing, Adam.

24:58.015 --> 25:00.059
Thank you, ma'am.

25:00.143 --> 25:02.854
Yeah, I think you're right.

26:05.041 --> 26:07.627
Yo, this courthouse
shit all looks the same.

26:10.713 --> 26:12.089
Oh, yeah. There he is.

26:12.173 --> 26:13.299
There he is.

26:13.382 --> 26:18.095
Yo, badass-looking Manny
Pacquiao with the knockout.

26:18.179 --> 26:20.431
Of course, the one guy
those motherfuckers arrest...

26:20.514 --> 26:21.724
Yeah, you. Get in. You get in.

26:21.766 --> 26:24.602
Yeah. Yo, this my cousin, Lena.

26:24.727 --> 26:25.937
Yo, thanks for the ride.

26:26.020 --> 26:27.104
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:27.188 --> 26:28.940
That's my boy.

26:29.023 --> 26:30.316
So, what's up, dude?

26:30.399 --> 26:32.818
- They locking you up or what?
- Nah.

26:32.944 --> 26:34.779
I can't go back to school for a few days.

26:34.862 --> 26:36.656
Hell, yeah.

26:36.739 --> 26:39.742
And then there's like
some court date sometime.

26:39.784 --> 26:41.452
Yeah, they always do that shit.

26:41.535 --> 26:43.496
Yo, I told Lena about
your mad ninja skills, man.

26:43.621 --> 26:45.122
That was dope. I would've stepped in more,

26:45.206 --> 26:46.332
but I had one piece of shit,

26:46.374 --> 26:47.875
I was busy with that one piece of shit.

26:48.042 --> 26:49.126
Anyway, this was all fucked up.

26:49.210 --> 26:50.461
So, I got permission, you know.

26:50.544 --> 26:51.837
What he means is he's weak.

26:51.963 --> 26:53.839
- Hey. You weak.
- You wanna smoke?

26:53.965 --> 26:55.633
When's the last time you did anything, huh?

26:55.675 --> 26:56.801
Fucking driving around.

26:56.884 --> 26:58.052
Where even is your baby right now?

27:01.847 --> 27:03.391
- Take it easy.
- Yo, bro.

27:03.474 --> 27:05.518
- Yeah.
- Lena's 21.

27:07.103 --> 27:08.646
What?

27:08.688 --> 27:12.358
Lena is 21.

27:16.779 --> 27:18.781
- You talking shit?
- Don't worry about it.

27:22.493 --> 27:23.577
I think he's nice.

27:23.661 --> 27:25.413
Everyone seems nice

27:25.496 --> 27:27.206
especially when they're interested in you.

27:27.290 --> 27:28.708
Maybe you should back off a bit.

27:28.791 --> 27:30.251
People don't like to
be talked to like that.

27:30.376 --> 27:32.378
Sensitivity is not a virtue.

27:32.461 --> 27:33.921
So, you get to decide what's
right and what's wrong?

27:34.088 --> 27:35.381
Leave me alone.

27:35.423 --> 27:36.799
Oh, she's defensive now.

27:36.841 --> 27:38.592
Cut it out, I said.

27:38.676 --> 27:40.261
How about we play a little game?

27:40.386 --> 27:41.679
Evelyn, is that a knife?

27:41.804 --> 27:44.140
I found it in the drawer... No, wait.

27:44.223 --> 27:45.808
You say, "Evelyn, where
did you get that knife?"

27:45.891 --> 27:47.685
And then I say, "I found it in the drawer."

27:47.727 --> 27:49.437
- Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
- Right, right, right.

27:49.520 --> 27:50.938
Evelyn, where did you get that knife?

27:51.105 --> 27:52.398
I found it in the drawer with Mom's letter.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.566
Wanna see?

27:53.691 --> 27:54.734
And then I'm all like, "Ah!"

27:54.817 --> 27:56.152
No. Please, no!

27:56.235 --> 27:57.695
- And we run around like...
- Boom. Chair.

27:57.737 --> 27:59.155
- On the couch.
- Yeah.

27:59.238 --> 28:01.115
You think that's good
enough for dress rehearsal?

28:01.157 --> 28:03.034
- Yeah, I think we got it.
- Cool.

28:06.537 --> 28:07.830
You good?

28:14.545 --> 28:16.213
That asshole guy is gonna
be doing the same thing

28:16.297 --> 28:19.550
this weekend to someone else.

28:19.633 --> 28:21.427
Yeah, probably.

28:25.848 --> 28:27.433
You ready?

28:30.728 --> 28:33.481
Yup. Yeah.

28:33.564 --> 28:35.441
Oh, she's defensive now.

28:35.524 --> 28:37.860
Cut it out, I said.

28:37.943 --> 28:41.447
- How about we play a little game?
- Jesus, Evelyn.

28:41.489 --> 28:42.865
Where did you get that knife from?

28:42.948 --> 28:45.076
I found it in the drawer with Mom's letter.

28:45.159 --> 28:47.286
Wanna see it?

28:47.370 --> 28:48.746
No, no, no, no.

28:48.871 --> 28:50.456
No!

28:54.877 --> 28:56.754
All right. Krista. Come on.

28:56.796 --> 28:58.005
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

28:58.172 --> 28:59.465
This is so stupid.

28:59.507 --> 29:00.591
Okay. Stop it.

29:00.674 --> 29:01.759
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

29:01.884 --> 29:03.177
Everyone, relax.

29:03.260 --> 29:05.888
Krista, what is it?

29:05.971 --> 29:09.183
Oh, my God, really?

29:09.225 --> 29:10.309
I don't...

29:10.393 --> 29:11.894
Excuse me. Can I suggest something?

29:11.936 --> 29:13.479
No. Nobody wants to hear it, Brandi.

29:13.562 --> 29:14.897
So, you wanna be here all night?

29:14.980 --> 29:16.899
- Okay. Okay. Let's...
- Oh, my God.

29:16.941 --> 29:20.027
What's going on with Evelyn right now?

29:20.194 --> 29:22.363
What's she feeling?

29:22.488 --> 29:26.117
Some jealousy and...

29:26.200 --> 29:27.785
rage.

29:27.910 --> 29:31.330
Can you think of anything
that could help you get there?

29:38.712 --> 29:40.673
Okay. Let's go again from the knife.

29:55.521 --> 29:57.440
Krista.

29:57.523 --> 29:58.941
It's just...

30:00.151 --> 30:02.069
Go after it.

30:02.820 --> 30:05.239
Allow yourself to get there.

30:22.965 --> 30:25.593
Y'all wanna see a
propane tank go boom-boom?

30:29.597 --> 30:32.099
That's what I'm talkin' about.

31:17.144 --> 31:19.522
Oh, you guys think you're so tough?

31:22.608 --> 31:25.152
Stop. This is not your time.

31:25.319 --> 31:27.238
Stop. I'm just getting ready

31:27.321 --> 31:29.323
and you're not...

31:46.674 --> 31:48.676
- There you go, sir.
- Thanks.

31:48.759 --> 31:50.135
Have a good day.

32:43.105 --> 32:46.692
Can I just say one more thing
about this manager bitch at Curtis?

32:46.775 --> 32:48.736
I like that she blames me for the way

32:48.819 --> 32:50.696
that the clothes in the
dressing room smells.

32:50.738 --> 32:52.740
Like, first of all, bitch, it's 10:00.

32:52.823 --> 32:54.783
I haven't even smoked yet.
Like, how rude is that?

32:54.867 --> 32:56.577
That she immediately comes out of there,

32:56.702 --> 32:57.870
pointing fingers at me.

32:57.995 --> 32:59.330
That's because you're special.

33:17.556 --> 33:19.850
All right. You got it. You got it.

33:19.933 --> 33:22.811
Shit.

33:22.895 --> 33:24.271
I remember this place.

33:28.442 --> 33:30.235
It's stinky out here.

33:30.361 --> 33:32.237
Lena, you hungry?

33:32.363 --> 33:33.822
I'm starving, bro.

33:33.906 --> 33:36.200
- What is this?
- Man, this shit is chafing.

33:36.283 --> 33:38.285
Just try it out.

33:38.452 --> 33:40.162
Some style, you know?

33:41.747 --> 33:42.831
All right. We're getting drinks.

33:42.915 --> 33:44.541
You guys get food.

33:44.625 --> 33:47.586
Oh, I don't... I don't
really have any money.

33:48.671 --> 33:50.214
That jacket does look good on him, though.

34:08.816 --> 34:09.942
Okay. Grab it.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.321
Nice job. Nice job.

34:16.949 --> 34:18.075
All right.

34:23.580 --> 34:24.790
Nito, you're up.

34:25.833 --> 34:26.667
Thank you.

34:26.792 --> 34:28.794
- Got that good dinner.
- You've only been out

34:28.836 --> 34:30.295
here telling us some shit went down inside.

34:30.421 --> 34:31.922
Lena's out here. All right.

34:32.005 --> 34:33.799
- Here's the story. All right.
- All right. All right.

34:33.841 --> 34:36.802
Talk. Go.

34:36.885 --> 34:38.929
So, we start in the
freezer section, obviously.

34:47.020 --> 34:48.647
I'm walking up to the
front 'cause you got to buy

34:48.731 --> 34:50.315
one thing, right? To
keep them from watching.

34:50.441 --> 34:51.942
So, we're walking up
and I pick this checkout

34:52.025 --> 34:53.819
with this chick behind it, right?

34:53.902 --> 34:55.821
And she had like a bitch face.

34:55.904 --> 34:58.532
Not like a Lena bitch face
but, like, definitely a bitch.

34:58.615 --> 34:59.658
Definitely a bitch.

35:00.993 --> 35:03.746
My boy's looking nervous as hell.

35:03.829 --> 35:06.582
- Trying.
- Like, you were trying, bro.

35:07.166 --> 35:08.584
So, I'm working that Yoni charm, you know.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.586
- Like, "How's it going?"
- Hit her with the quick mack.

35:10.669 --> 35:12.254
Exactly. Yeah, friendly and shit, right?

35:12.296 --> 35:14.131
But she just... Bloop! Slides
the chips across the thing.

35:14.173 --> 35:15.466
- Across the counter.
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:15.924 --> 35:17.132
What sound did it make?

35:17.134 --> 35:17.843
Bloop!

35:18.385 --> 35:19.553
What?

35:19.595 --> 35:20.971
That's the sound it makes, bro.

35:21.054 --> 35:22.598
Is that not the sound it makes?

35:22.681 --> 35:24.558
- Yo, yo, yo, yo.
- All right. All right.

35:24.600 --> 35:26.852
Let me get fucking back
to it. The chips go: Bloop!

35:26.894 --> 35:28.604
All right.

35:28.687 --> 35:30.981
That's when she looks over, boom.

35:31.064 --> 35:34.860
At Nito, specifically at his jacket

35:34.902 --> 35:36.653
where underneath he has like every flavor

35:36.737 --> 35:38.614
of Hot Pockets fucking
pressed up against his balls.

35:38.697 --> 35:41.033
He's fucking freezing his
fucking balls off, okay?

35:41.158 --> 35:43.285
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And she goes,

35:43.327 --> 35:46.371
- "Y'all going somewhere cold?"
- Oh, shit.

35:46.497 --> 35:49.917
But then Nito, as cool as
can be, goes, "No, ma'am.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.878
It just gets a little chilly
in the freezer section."

35:52.920 --> 35:54.755
Boom, dude.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.632
Gets a little chilly
in the freezer section.

35:58.967 --> 36:00.969
- Nito. Cheers.
- Nito, baby.

36:01.053 --> 36:02.930
- Hot Pockets.
- Say Hot Pocket.

36:03.013 --> 36:05.390
Sing it. You sound just
like the Hot Pocket person.

36:05.516 --> 36:06.975
Hey, how did it go? How did it go, Nito?

36:07.059 --> 36:08.894
Hot Pockets.

36:08.977 --> 36:10.187
Yeah. Fuck off now.

36:10.229 --> 36:11.313
Fuck off.

36:11.396 --> 36:12.898
All right. All right.

36:40.050 --> 36:41.802
Hot magma. I didn't even see it coming,

36:41.927 --> 36:44.930
but you can't blame a hurricane.

36:48.141 --> 36:50.686
Today is a day of reckoning.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.566
Well, my dad, he has this
parakeet and that's like his shit,

38:19.733 --> 38:21.443
that's what he, like, cares about.

38:21.526 --> 38:23.320
Your dad just owns a parakeet?

38:23.362 --> 38:25.447
Like the first week I got
here, he got out of its cage

38:25.530 --> 38:27.032
and the door was open...

38:27.074 --> 38:28.367
...and I had this nervous breakdown.

38:28.450 --> 38:29.868
Okay. Yeah.

38:29.952 --> 38:32.037
- It's funny now. This...
- It is funny.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.747
That should be the movement piece.

38:33.830 --> 38:35.457
What's a movement piece?

38:35.499 --> 38:37.042
It's like a scene but with your body.

38:38.752 --> 38:41.129
And you could do the drums
too, you could do the music.

38:41.213 --> 38:42.756
- Okay. But like in front...
- Yeah.

38:42.798 --> 38:45.801
...of other people? Yeah?

38:45.884 --> 38:47.761
Yeah. Yeah.

38:47.803 --> 38:49.972
And then I'm, like, searching
for the bird, like, where is it?

38:50.055 --> 38:51.556
- Yeah. Just like that?
- Yeah.

38:51.682 --> 38:52.808
Just like, where's the bird?

38:52.891 --> 38:54.267
- Where's the bird?
- And it's like, "What?"

38:54.351 --> 38:55.852
Do like a little, like:

38:56.937 --> 38:58.689
Like a little:

38:58.772 --> 38:59.773
What? What? What?

38:59.856 --> 39:01.525
There's a bird. There's a bird.

39:03.485 --> 39:06.363
What do parakeets make? Like:

39:06.488 --> 39:10.242
Parakeets, um, it just, annoying
chirp sounds, like chirp...

39:12.077 --> 39:13.370
It's not even that pretty. You go:

39:14.121 --> 39:16.873
But it's like:

39:16.957 --> 39:17.874
I can't do it.

39:19.209 --> 39:23.880
Bird. And bird, and flying,
flying, flying, flying, bop.

39:24.089 --> 39:26.383
Another quick tip: keep your
video short and sweet, okay?

39:26.508 --> 39:28.260
You're gonna wanna keep
it in the two-minute

39:28.385 --> 39:30.095
to four-minute range.
Don't go over four minutes,

39:30.178 --> 39:31.805
all right? I'm sure you noticed a lot

39:31.847 --> 39:33.557
of YouTube channels do that quick cutting

39:33.640 --> 39:35.517
because nobody wants to
sit there and watch you talk

39:35.600 --> 39:37.728
and talk and talk. People do
not have the attention span.

39:37.811 --> 39:39.312
They're all trying to fill that void.

39:39.396 --> 39:41.857
On that note, add graphics,
you could add music,

39:41.940 --> 39:44.443
you could add transitions,
don't make your videos boring.

39:44.526 --> 39:46.820
I'm gonna show you a few
tricks about how to do that

39:46.903 --> 39:48.069
in your editing software.

39:48.071 --> 39:50.824
-Also as you can see, I invested
in a really cool green screen.

39:51.033 --> 39:52.034
-you might wanna do that,

39:52.117 --> 39:53.910
you can do a lot of fun
stuff in your videos,

39:53.994 --> 39:55.829
I'll show you how to do a little keying out

39:55.912 --> 39:58.331
of your green screen and
make your videos really pop.

39:58.415 --> 40:00.042
All right? Check it out.

40:03.587 --> 40:06.131
There's leftovers in the fridge.

40:06.214 --> 40:08.008
Yeah, found them.

40:31.198 --> 40:33.241
Your show making you any money yet?

40:35.577 --> 40:36.620
Lance.

40:51.885 --> 40:53.386
That's the American spirit, baby.

40:53.470 --> 40:55.472
I don't know if you call it a treat.

41:01.895 --> 41:05.482
I mean, it says emergency
exit but shit's busted.

41:05.607 --> 41:06.316
Are there cameras?

41:06.399 --> 41:07.901
Little fake ones.

41:07.984 --> 41:09.945
Nah, they're too cheap for video shit.

41:10.028 --> 41:11.321
And what are we trying to get?

41:11.404 --> 41:12.614
- Perfume and cologne.
- Yeah.

41:12.697 --> 41:13.698
That's easiest to flip.

41:13.824 --> 41:15.117
Little cardboard boxes.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.702
Yo, listen.

41:17.828 --> 41:20.288
They got little curly "C" logos on them.

41:20.372 --> 41:23.834
But once you're in, go
all the way this way,

41:23.917 --> 41:25.919
bottom shelf.

41:25.961 --> 41:28.421
Yo, you ready?

41:31.508 --> 41:33.051
- All right.
- Fucking yes, dude.

41:33.135 --> 41:34.427
That's our boy. That's our boy.

41:34.511 --> 41:35.971
- Hell yeah.
- Do you need a boost?

41:36.054 --> 41:37.514
I got it.

41:37.639 --> 41:40.684
- He's got it.
- Look at this fucking dude.

41:40.767 --> 41:42.978
Damn. Okay.

41:43.061 --> 41:44.563
I'll drop it down over there.

41:44.646 --> 41:46.148
- What did I tell you?
- Monkey man.

41:46.231 --> 41:47.315
That's what I said.

41:47.399 --> 41:48.525
Yoni, where did you find this kid?

41:48.567 --> 41:50.235
Fucking side of the street.

41:50.277 --> 41:51.528
Doing kick flips and shit.

43:06.019 --> 43:07.354
Yeah, let's go.

43:09.522 --> 43:13.360
- Give me that.
- Come on, let's go.

43:13.443 --> 43:14.736
Let's go. Let's go.

43:15.028 --> 43:18.365
One more. Yo. I'm coming down.

43:18.448 --> 43:19.908
What the fuck is this shit?

43:20.033 --> 43:21.618
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

43:23.828 --> 43:25.330
- Go. Go.
- Let's go.

44:07.414 --> 44:08.456
Ta-da!

44:08.790 --> 44:10.083
Pretty cool, huh?

44:10.166 --> 44:11.376
Yeah, this is crazy.

44:11.459 --> 44:13.670
They got, like, everything you'd want.

44:13.712 --> 44:15.797
Or not want.

44:15.839 --> 44:18.466
Yeah. That's the drum.

44:18.550 --> 44:20.135
In here?

44:20.218 --> 44:23.221
Go for it.

44:30.812 --> 44:33.148
Yeah. Most people are just doing like

44:33.231 --> 44:36.568
stage combat stuff,
fighting, for the project

44:36.693 --> 44:40.196
but I think I wanna do something different.

44:40.280 --> 44:43.742
A little more flowy and...

44:46.161 --> 44:47.245
What is this?

44:49.581 --> 44:52.417
Check this out.

44:52.459 --> 44:55.295
Shoulder, shoulder action. Perfect bird.

44:55.420 --> 44:57.464
Probably like, lasso it, like it's flying.

44:57.547 --> 44:58.923
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

44:59.049 --> 45:00.717
- That's a good idea.
- Oh, actually,

45:00.842 --> 45:02.969
do you wanna try something
with me? All right.

45:03.136 --> 45:05.597
We're gonna do stage slap. So,
put your hands up like this.

45:06.431 --> 45:09.434
- And then, drop your left one down.
- Okay.

45:09.517 --> 45:13.563
And I'm gonna come
around, and I'm gonna slap,

45:13.646 --> 45:15.440
but I'm gonna slap your hand.

45:15.523 --> 45:17.859
It's gonna look like I
hit your face, got it?

45:17.942 --> 45:19.527
Okay. Let's see what this is.

45:19.611 --> 45:22.864
Okay.

45:23.615 --> 45:24.657
No!

45:25.742 --> 45:26.451
No.

45:26.534 --> 45:28.912
You gotta... you gotta...
you gotta sell the reaction.

45:28.995 --> 45:31.164
You gotta, like, make me feel it.

45:31.247 --> 45:33.166
You just gotta sell the reaction, got it?

45:33.208 --> 45:35.168
Just let me try something.

45:35.251 --> 45:38.171
Yeah.

45:38.880 --> 45:40.298
Okay.

45:40.382 --> 45:44.386
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Yeah. Let's do this.

45:44.469 --> 45:45.887
Are you sure you're ready?

45:45.970 --> 45:47.222
Let's do this.

45:50.350 --> 45:50.642
Better.

45:50.767 --> 45:52.394
- A little bit better. Okay.
- Oh, okay.

45:52.477 --> 45:54.354
I'm gonna fake choke you now.

45:54.479 --> 45:56.398
- Great.
- Okay? Okay. Cool.

45:56.481 --> 45:58.775
Um, I'm gonna go like this,

45:58.900 --> 46:02.779
and then, I'm gonna put
right here, is that okay?

46:04.531 --> 46:07.575
And then you're gonna put
your hands on my wrists.

46:10.537 --> 46:12.372
Okay, on my wrists.

46:13.623 --> 46:16.209
Oh, and tuck your chin in.

46:16.334 --> 46:17.919
So... and then it's
basically just up to you to,

46:18.002 --> 46:22.132
you know, like, sell the effect and, uh...

46:27.554 --> 46:30.265
But we don't... we don't have to, you know.

46:30.348 --> 46:32.016
That's an intense one, so...

46:43.987 --> 46:45.947
So Nick had just left,
and I was like alone,

46:45.989 --> 46:48.950
packing up my truck.
And I hear this snorting,

46:48.992 --> 46:50.952
and it's like running fast.

46:51.119 --> 46:52.537
Of course I had my Glock on my waist,

46:52.579 --> 46:54.289
so I pull out the pistol.

46:54.372 --> 46:56.291
Right when I see its
nose pointing right at me,

46:56.374 --> 47:00.837
just this 300-pound
warthog, straight pissed off.

47:00.962 --> 47:02.672
So I take aim and:

47:04.591 --> 47:07.260
9-mil might as well have
been BBs on this thing.

47:07.302 --> 47:09.262
So I was lucky I hadn't
broke down Charlotte yet.

47:11.764 --> 47:13.975
So I reach back on the tailgate
real quick and pick her up:

47:15.351 --> 47:16.769
So I get the fourth and fifth round off,

47:16.978 --> 47:19.022
and she lunges for me. I
try to deke out of the way,

47:19.105 --> 47:21.858
but her bigass head pinched
my arm into the truck.

47:21.983 --> 47:24.861
That's actually where I got this.

47:25.361 --> 47:27.572
So I hit the ground hard,
and I turn just in time

47:27.614 --> 47:29.282
to one-hand a couple more rounds at her.

47:29.324 --> 47:35.580
She shakes, and rolls over squealing
like five feet away from me.

47:38.458 --> 47:40.126
And that's that, guys and girls.

47:40.293 --> 47:42.295
That's what makes the
difference between a shooter

47:42.337 --> 47:43.630
and a prime shooter.

47:43.713 --> 47:45.298
So keep your guns good and handy.

47:45.340 --> 47:46.925
And thanks for watching another episode.

47:47.008 --> 47:49.928
Don't forget to comment
below and subscribe.

48:16.371 --> 48:17.914
Yeah?

48:17.956 --> 48:20.375
Adam? Just checking on you.

48:21.668 --> 48:23.920
Uh, okay.

48:24.045 --> 48:25.171
You all right?

48:28.841 --> 48:30.343
Hey, yeah.

48:30.426 --> 48:33.638
I just wanted to talk to you. That's all.

48:34.639 --> 48:35.932
Okay.

48:36.057 --> 48:38.101
Your mom and I, uh, we just wanna make sure

48:38.184 --> 48:40.353
that you're doing okay.

48:42.689 --> 48:44.107
- I wanna know.
- Yeah. I'm fine.

48:44.190 --> 48:46.693
I'm fine. How are you?

48:46.776 --> 48:49.070
Because you're always in
here with the door closed,

48:49.112 --> 48:51.823
I mean, we never get to see you.

48:51.948 --> 48:54.951
I mean, don't you wanna
have some friends, or...

48:55.076 --> 48:57.495
You're the one who said
Nick couldn't come over.

48:57.579 --> 49:00.873
Nick smoked a cigarette in our bathroom.

49:00.957 --> 49:02.125
That was years ago.

49:02.208 --> 49:03.126
Well, I have friends now online.

49:03.209 --> 49:04.961
Okay, well, tell me about these people.

49:05.003 --> 49:06.421
What do you mean?

49:06.504 --> 49:08.673
Well, tell me who they
are, where they live,

49:08.715 --> 49:11.884
- are they fanatics?
- What, are you interrogating me?

49:11.968 --> 49:15.013
Well, a lot of these online
people are brainwashed,

49:15.096 --> 49:16.681
- and it can really...
- Brainwashed?

49:16.723 --> 49:17.557
- Who's brainwashed?
- ...get out of control,

49:17.682 --> 49:18.474
- if you go along, and if you...
- There are people out there

49:18.558 --> 49:20.018
telling you what the corrupt media...

49:20.101 --> 49:23.104
Adam. Son.

49:23.187 --> 49:26.983
We appreciate the fact that
you're going after what you want.

49:27.025 --> 49:29.569
I mean, we taught you that.

49:29.694 --> 49:34.574
But is there a point where this
isn't working out so well, and...?

49:36.492 --> 49:38.202
Is that a new camera in there?

49:38.328 --> 49:39.746
- What?
- When did you get that?

49:39.829 --> 49:41.247
I don't know. A couple...

49:41.414 --> 49:43.541
Last week, maybe.

49:43.625 --> 49:45.710
I thought you were saving up.

49:45.752 --> 49:48.004
I am, I am. I just... I
need to get it going first.

49:48.046 --> 49:49.297
Adam,

49:51.424 --> 49:53.343
your mother doesn't agree with me,

49:53.426 --> 49:55.887
but I think it's time

49:56.012 --> 49:57.805
that we not support you anymore,

49:57.889 --> 50:00.350
not financially.

50:01.017 --> 50:02.435
We just...

50:04.145 --> 50:05.647
think it's time that you get on your own.

50:13.029 --> 50:14.822
Okay, what was that?

50:14.906 --> 50:16.449
Y'all all right?

50:18.743 --> 50:21.162
Yeah, Mom,

50:21.204 --> 50:22.747
everything's fine.

50:55.863 --> 50:58.908
Hit it. Pass it down. You hit it.

50:59.784 --> 51:02.078
Yo, I lost mine, bro. I want that.

51:05.498 --> 51:07.500
Lena, check the footwork.

51:08.876 --> 51:10.628
I stole something real good
from the store this time.

51:16.509 --> 51:18.594
Stop filming over here, bro, film that.

51:18.678 --> 51:19.512
Hey, film that shit.

51:19.595 --> 51:21.264
Film that!

51:24.100 --> 51:25.143
He's going!

51:25.226 --> 51:27.311
Yeah, come on.

52:09.979 --> 52:12.940
All right.

52:13.024 --> 52:16.903
Next week, we begin
movement performances, okay?

52:16.986 --> 52:18.863
So, get your rehearsing in on that.

52:18.905 --> 52:22.283
Also we've got minute
monologues from Missy, Dylan,

52:22.325 --> 52:25.161
Krista and Bryce.

52:25.286 --> 52:28.664
Finish your cooldown, clear yourselves out.

52:28.748 --> 52:30.750
Give yourselves a minute.

52:30.958 --> 52:33.795
Have you picked out your monologue yet?

52:33.878 --> 52:36.798
Yeah, I think so. I've
been reading some stuff.

52:36.881 --> 52:38.174
Cool.

52:38.216 --> 52:40.009
Lunch off campus tomorrow,

52:40.092 --> 52:41.886
we can work on it if you want.

52:41.969 --> 52:43.054
Sure.

52:44.096 --> 52:45.890
- Cool.
- Cool.

52:48.601 --> 52:50.102
Stop it.

53:33.145 --> 53:34.689
Other direction? Yes, yes?

53:34.772 --> 53:36.983
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

53:45.366 --> 53:46.450
Last part.

53:50.162 --> 53:53.374
Then I'm mopey, walking home, like...

53:56.419 --> 53:59.255
Front door, open...

53:59.297 --> 54:03.384
the... door, step inside, close the door.

54:12.101 --> 54:13.811
Yeah!

54:13.895 --> 54:18.399
Bird! We got the bird!
We got the freaking bird!

54:33.164 --> 54:37.209
Anyway, I really liked
the prayer bit that time.

54:37.293 --> 54:38.878
Yeah. That was great.

54:44.842 --> 54:46.010
Yeah.

54:46.093 --> 54:49.305
- You're really good.
- Thank you.

54:49.347 --> 54:51.599
Well, you're very good at drumming, so...

54:55.436 --> 54:57.897
What? What?

54:58.022 --> 54:59.357
- Why are you laughing?
- Nothing.

54:59.440 --> 55:02.360
It's just, I had this thought.

55:02.443 --> 55:04.111
What's the thought?

56:00.126 --> 56:01.544
Go, go!

56:36.912 --> 56:38.205
Early start?

56:40.916 --> 56:42.043
Yeah.

56:57.475 --> 56:58.851
You need this?

56:59.935 --> 57:01.062
Please.

57:19.371 --> 57:20.873
Punched the wall.

57:25.461 --> 57:27.171
I'm sorry...

57:28.339 --> 57:30.341
that I did that.

57:30.466 --> 57:32.384
Glad you're coming around, son.

57:37.473 --> 57:38.599
Thanks.

58:33.237 --> 58:34.530
Hi, Mr. Mannigan.

58:34.572 --> 58:36.240
Morning, Krista, how are you?

58:36.323 --> 58:37.533
I'm pretty good, and you?

58:37.658 --> 58:38.951
That's good.

58:39.034 --> 58:41.036
Well, walking to school today, huh?

58:41.120 --> 58:42.246
Yes, sir.

58:42.288 --> 58:43.873
All right, enjoy the day.

58:43.956 --> 58:46.542
Definitely. You too.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.488
Lunch date.

59:57.613 --> 59:59.615
- Hells yeah.
- Uh, yours?

59:59.740 --> 1:00:02.326
- Sure.
- Did you drive?

1:00:02.368 --> 1:00:03.535
- Walked.
- Okay. Perfect.

1:00:03.619 --> 1:00:04.954
Let's go.

1:00:05.037 --> 1:00:06.622
- Wait. Script?
- Yes.

1:00:06.664 --> 1:00:08.332
Okay. Cool.

1:00:22.763 --> 1:00:24.348
Hey, Krista.

1:00:24.390 --> 1:00:26.350
Hey.

1:00:26.433 --> 1:00:28.227
Dude, get in, man.

1:00:28.352 --> 1:00:31.105
We gotta go.

1:00:40.072 --> 1:00:41.448
We got a mission today.

1:00:41.532 --> 1:00:42.908
We gotta take care of something real fast.

1:00:43.075 --> 1:00:46.161
- What, now?
- Yeah. Fucking now.

1:00:46.245 --> 1:00:47.371
Lena got fired.

1:00:47.454 --> 1:00:50.124
Fucking fired me. Old bitch.

1:00:50.207 --> 1:00:51.709
She basically called me fucking dumb,

1:00:51.792 --> 1:00:54.169
like, to my face, in front of everyone.

1:00:54.253 --> 1:00:58.674
And she took my fucking vape
while I was in the bathroom.

1:00:58.716 --> 1:01:01.677
So, hold up, you think
she took your vape home?

1:01:01.719 --> 1:01:03.137
Yeah.

1:01:03.220 --> 1:01:05.097
Where the fuck else is she gonna take it?

1:01:05.139 --> 1:01:06.390
Can we just get some food first?

1:01:06.473 --> 1:01:07.725
Shut the fuck up.

1:01:07.808 --> 1:01:09.226
No.

1:01:09.310 --> 1:01:12.396
This is fucking bullshit.

1:01:12.438 --> 1:01:15.399
She thinks she rules the world.

1:01:15.441 --> 1:01:16.859
So, all you fucking pussies

1:01:16.942 --> 1:01:19.111
don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1:01:19.194 --> 1:01:20.529
You think I don't know what I did?

1:01:20.612 --> 1:01:22.573
You think I don't know
what I'm talking about?

1:01:22.698 --> 1:01:24.283
You wanna give a, like,

1:01:24.408 --> 1:01:26.827
a fucking biology lesson or something?

1:01:26.869 --> 1:01:28.412
Don't fucking say anything about me.

1:01:28.495 --> 1:01:29.955
Don't fucking make fun of me.

1:01:30.122 --> 1:01:31.749
You fucking talking shit on the Internet?

1:01:31.832 --> 1:01:33.959
You're too fucking scared
to face me in real life, huh?

1:01:34.126 --> 1:01:36.503
You can't fucking face me in the real life.

1:01:36.587 --> 1:01:38.422
I'll fucking kill all of
you, you sissy-ass bitches.

1:01:38.505 --> 1:01:39.840
I'll shoot you in the fucking mouth.

1:01:39.923 --> 1:01:41.467
Then let's see what we
have to say about it.

1:01:41.550 --> 1:01:43.469
You fucks.

1:01:43.552 --> 1:01:44.762
Fuck...

1:01:56.774 --> 1:02:00.486
She is at the store until, like,
6:00, and her husband works in this...

1:02:00.569 --> 1:02:01.945
Let's go.

1:02:02.071 --> 1:02:04.239
We'll get in and out, no big.

1:02:06.784 --> 1:02:09.370
All right, go.

1:02:09.453 --> 1:02:11.205
We're already fucking sitting here.

1:02:11.288 --> 1:02:12.581
This is so fucking dumb.

1:02:12.664 --> 1:02:14.375
Go get my shit.

1:02:14.458 --> 1:02:16.585
Come on, Pacquiao, let's go.

1:02:18.670 --> 1:02:20.547
For a fucking vape, stupid.

1:02:20.631 --> 1:02:23.258
Yo, around the side.

1:02:36.814 --> 1:02:38.315
It's locked.

1:02:38.399 --> 1:02:40.901
Yeah, duh. Hey, take a look.

1:02:40.943 --> 1:02:42.194
Yup.

1:02:42.277 --> 1:02:45.030
- There you go.
- That shit.

1:02:45.197 --> 1:02:47.282
All right, Nito,

1:02:47.366 --> 1:02:49.660
suit up.

1:02:49.785 --> 1:02:51.912
Okay.

1:02:51.995 --> 1:02:53.664
Let's go, let's go.

1:02:53.789 --> 1:02:54.915
I got you. Hop up.

1:02:54.957 --> 1:02:56.333
- Got it, yeah.
- Shit.

1:02:56.417 --> 1:02:57.501
Yeah, there you go.

1:02:57.584 --> 1:02:58.794
Oh, okay.

1:02:58.836 --> 1:03:01.547
There you go.

1:03:01.630 --> 1:03:04.216
Oh, shit, dude.

1:03:04.258 --> 1:03:06.969
You good, bro?

1:03:07.052 --> 1:03:08.345
Okay.

1:03:08.429 --> 1:03:10.013
All right, Nito.

1:03:10.139 --> 1:03:11.723
- Yo, this about to be easy.
- Yup.

1:03:13.350 --> 1:03:15.519
And then come down and get this door, yo.

1:03:17.062 --> 1:03:18.313
There you go.

1:04:10.449 --> 1:04:11.867
What have we got going on over here?

1:04:11.992 --> 1:04:14.077
We got some table knives, we got some...

1:04:14.203 --> 1:04:17.080
Oh, shit, bro,

1:04:17.206 --> 1:04:18.457
look at this fucking knife.

1:04:18.624 --> 1:04:19.666
The fucking flowers.

1:04:19.750 --> 1:04:21.627
There's some stupid shit in this world.

1:04:21.710 --> 1:04:23.629
Garbage.

1:04:25.923 --> 1:04:27.591
- Did you find it?
- Relax.

1:04:27.674 --> 1:04:29.593
It's probably not gonna
be in the kitchen, is it?

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:32.930
Fucking smartass.

1:04:33.013 --> 1:04:34.431
- The detective.
- Oh, shit.

1:04:34.515 --> 1:04:36.225
We got some beer,
motherfucker, you want one?

1:04:36.308 --> 1:04:37.434
- You need one.
- No?

1:04:37.518 --> 1:04:38.644
You need one, bro.

1:04:38.727 --> 1:04:41.063
- No?
- Fuck it.

1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:45.150
Bet you can't kill the whole
pack before they get home.

1:04:45.317 --> 1:04:47.819
- Bet?
- Bet.

1:04:47.903 --> 1:04:49.905
What do they got to eat up in this bitch?

1:04:50.030 --> 1:04:52.908
Nothing.

1:04:52.950 --> 1:04:54.326
Should we make some pancakes?

1:04:54.409 --> 1:04:58.330
Yeah, cook up.

1:04:58.413 --> 1:05:00.374
Oh, I got to burp.

1:05:00.457 --> 1:05:02.084
Where is it at? You check upstairs yet?

1:05:03.377 --> 1:05:05.379
- Not yet.
- Cool.

1:06:46.605 --> 1:06:47.773
Krista.

1:06:47.856 --> 1:06:49.358
Krista, Krista.

1:06:54.154 --> 1:06:55.197
No.

1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:57.032
No.

1:07:06.041 --> 1:07:07.668
Please, please.

1:07:55.424 --> 1:07:57.509
Wakes County 911.

1:07:57.551 --> 1:07:58.635
Hello?

1:07:58.719 --> 1:08:00.637
911, what is your emergency?

1:08:00.721 --> 1:08:02.264
I'd like to... I'd like
to report a break-in.

1:08:02.347 --> 1:08:03.807
Are they still in the house, sir?

1:08:03.849 --> 1:08:05.016
No ma'am, I don't...

1:08:05.100 --> 1:08:06.727
Okay. And where are you at?

1:08:06.810 --> 1:08:08.520
- Are you at the...
- I shot them.

1:08:08.562 --> 1:08:10.105
Sir, you said you shot one of them?

1:08:10.230 --> 1:08:12.816
No, I shot... I shot all three of them.

1:08:12.858 --> 1:08:16.027
I... They came inside...
They came inside my house.

1:08:16.111 --> 1:08:17.446
I understand.

1:08:17.529 --> 1:08:18.613
Okay, what I'm gonna have you do...

1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:21.575
There are officers on their way.

1:08:21.658 --> 1:08:23.827
Sir, what I'm gonna ask you to do

1:08:23.869 --> 1:08:27.122
is put your weapon away for
when they get there, okay?

1:08:27.247 --> 1:08:29.291
What kind of firearm did you use?

1:08:31.126 --> 1:08:33.462
Sir?

1:08:33.545 --> 1:08:34.963
Sir, what did you shoot them with?

1:08:35.046 --> 1:08:37.257
With my rifle.

1:08:37.299 --> 1:08:38.717
Okay. Secure the weapon.

1:08:38.842 --> 1:08:41.470
Make sure it's put up,
take out the magazine.

1:08:41.553 --> 1:08:44.639
Make sure the weapon is secure
and I'm gonna need you to unload it

1:08:44.723 --> 1:08:46.892
before the officers get there.

1:09:13.293 --> 1:09:14.961
I was just in my kitchen, I heard something

1:09:15.045 --> 1:09:17.172
that sounded like thunder
coming from across the street.

1:09:17.297 --> 1:09:19.049
I've lived here 20 years,

1:09:19.174 --> 1:09:21.176
we've never had anything like this before.

1:09:21.218 --> 1:09:23.303
You don't expect it to
happen in your neighborhood

1:09:23.345 --> 1:09:25.764
and, you know, when that happens,

1:09:25.889 --> 1:09:27.808
you lose all sense of security.

1:09:27.891 --> 1:09:29.601
And I feel sorry for
their families and things,

1:09:29.684 --> 1:09:31.311
but they were in the house
and they shouldn't have been.

1:09:31.394 --> 1:09:33.688
This is other people's property....

1:10:15.939 --> 1:10:17.732
...when three teenagers are suspected

1:10:17.816 --> 1:10:21.570
to have broken into the home
of Lance and Mabel Mannigan,

1:10:21.653 --> 1:10:23.655
their 24-year-old
son Adam

1:10:23.738 --> 1:10:26.032
defended the home with deadly force,

1:10:26.116 --> 1:10:30.579
using an assault rifle to
take down all three suspects.

1:10:30.662 --> 1:10:34.249
The suspects entered
the home around 12:37 PM,

1:10:34.291 --> 1:10:35.876
and are reported to have been armed

1:10:35.959 --> 1:10:37.294
with knives and brass knuckles,

1:10:37.377 --> 1:10:39.045
which provides evidence

1:10:39.129 --> 1:10:42.799
that they were entering
with potential deadly force.

1:10:42.883 --> 1:10:45.719
A fourth suspect was
caught fleeing the scene

1:10:45.802 --> 1:10:47.387
in a silver Mazda Sedan.

1:10:47.470 --> 1:10:50.390
She is now being held for questioning.

1:10:56.855 --> 1:11:00.400
And yes, we have found evidence
to suggest a perceived threat

1:11:00.442 --> 1:11:02.193
from persons entering the home, yes.

1:11:02.277 --> 1:11:04.905
Will this fall under the
stand-your-ground law?

1:11:04.988 --> 1:11:07.115
I think we'll let the
lawyers decide all that.

1:11:07.198 --> 1:11:09.701
Adam Mannigan will be
speaking on home defense

1:11:09.743 --> 1:11:12.454
next Wednesday at city
hall, alongside the mayor,

1:11:12.579 --> 1:11:14.748
and representatives from the...

1:12:25.944 --> 1:12:28.488
Go ahead, Krista, you can sit here.

1:12:28.530 --> 1:12:30.073
How are you feeling?

1:12:32.117 --> 1:12:35.078
You know we have people you can talk to,

1:12:35.161 --> 1:12:37.080
they're specialized in this...

1:12:37.163 --> 1:12:39.916
Uh, situations, like yours.

1:12:41.793 --> 1:12:43.920
I wanna move lockers.

1:12:44.004 --> 1:12:45.130
Of course.

1:12:45.213 --> 1:12:47.215
And we wanna do everything we can

1:12:47.298 --> 1:12:50.677
to make your transition back to
school as seamless as possible.

1:12:50.802 --> 1:12:52.095
And if another locker...

1:12:52.137 --> 1:12:54.514
I wanna move my fucking locker.

1:13:02.272 --> 1:13:05.275
Listen, Krista, we all know
that you've been through a lot,

1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:06.943
but language like that is not gonna open up

1:13:07.027 --> 1:13:08.695
communication between us, and ultimately...

1:13:50.236 --> 1:13:53.156
You're feeling pent up.

1:13:53.239 --> 1:13:57.786
Something rises up inside you like a burp,

1:13:57.869 --> 1:14:00.455
but no,

1:14:00.497 --> 1:14:03.166
it goes back down again,

1:14:03.249 --> 1:14:06.169
but you feel it coming.

1:14:06.252 --> 1:14:08.713
Everyone else had it inside them, too.

1:14:10.590 --> 1:14:14.177
Now, ask yourself,

1:14:14.219 --> 1:14:17.180
what is on the other side of it?

1:14:17.222 --> 1:14:20.767
And you belch it out.

1:15:32.589 --> 1:15:33.715
That's right.

1:15:37.677 --> 1:15:38.970
All right, guys.

1:15:39.012 --> 1:15:42.557
This episode, we're gonna be talking
about urban close-range tactical firing.

1:15:42.682 --> 1:15:44.601
Room clearing, like they
do in the military, too.

1:15:44.684 --> 1:15:46.561
Some badass shit for some badass shooters.

1:15:46.603 --> 1:15:48.396
Before we get started,
I wanna give some thanks

1:15:48.479 --> 1:15:51.274
for the support from the local
chapter of Rifleman's Association,

1:15:51.316 --> 1:15:52.984
and the Wakefield Fire Department,

1:15:53.067 --> 1:15:55.361
for letting us shoot
in their burn building.

1:15:55.445 --> 1:15:57.697
It's pretty cool.

1:15:57.780 --> 1:15:59.282
Let's get in there.

1:15:59.324 --> 1:16:01.159
All right. So when we're room clearing,

1:16:01.284 --> 1:16:04.329
we're gonna be using the
concept of slicing the pie,

1:16:04.412 --> 1:16:06.706
which is basically taking
different sections of the room

1:16:06.789 --> 1:16:10.460
that you see and moving on one by one,

1:16:10.585 --> 1:16:12.462
clearing each sector of the pie,

1:16:12.587 --> 1:16:14.714
as you get through the entire room.

1:16:14.797 --> 1:16:17.175
Now, you wanna focus on
a couple different things

1:16:17.300 --> 1:16:19.385
when you're room clearing,
uh, you never wanna rush,

1:16:19.469 --> 1:16:21.179
you always wanna be taking your time,

1:16:21.304 --> 1:16:24.307
you wanna stay balanced, grounded,

1:16:24.349 --> 1:16:26.017
you wanna have a really firm setting

1:16:26.059 --> 1:16:27.810
and a low center of balance,

1:16:27.936 --> 1:16:30.313
as you focus on each section.

1:16:30.355 --> 1:16:31.731
We're gonna start with this room,

1:16:31.773 --> 1:16:35.151
you could watch how I shuffle,

1:16:35.235 --> 1:16:38.738
for instance, with this space,
we're gonna shuffle to the left.

1:16:38.780 --> 1:16:42.325
So let's try it out.

1:16:48.873 --> 1:16:50.333
See you next time.

1:17:06.349 --> 1:17:08.351
Overreacting?

1:17:08.434 --> 1:17:12.105
Would you consider
lightning an overreaction?

1:17:13.356 --> 1:17:16.442
A volcano erupting?

1:17:16.526 --> 1:17:19.153
A hurricane hitting the mainland?

1:17:19.237 --> 1:17:21.281
These are natural conditions.

1:17:21.364 --> 1:17:23.992
One may even see it coming.

1:17:24.075 --> 1:17:26.786
But you can't blame a hurricane.

1:17:28.788 --> 1:17:30.832
You're mad.

1:17:30.915 --> 1:17:33.584
It shows when you're on
one of these poetic rants,

1:17:33.668 --> 1:17:36.254
I'm beginning to pity you.

1:17:36.379 --> 1:17:39.215
It is you who deserves pity,

1:17:39.299 --> 1:17:41.092
you sad,

1:17:41.134 --> 1:17:43.011
sad man.

1:17:44.804 --> 1:17:47.181
But you will get none from me today,

1:17:48.808 --> 1:17:51.728
for there is liquid hot magma

1:17:51.811 --> 1:17:53.813
surging inside me,

1:17:53.855 --> 1:17:55.940
and ink-black clouds

1:17:56.107 --> 1:17:59.736
spiraling overhead.

1:17:59.819 --> 1:18:02.447
Today is a day...

1:18:03.448 --> 1:18:05.116
of reckoning.

1:18:23.551 --> 1:18:25.303
Ladies and gentleman,
we're gonna get started

1:18:25.428 --> 1:18:27.764
in just a couple of
minutes, then I believe, uh,

1:18:27.847 --> 1:18:30.141
our hero is gonna say a few words for us.

1:18:30.183 --> 1:18:31.267
Thank you for coming.

1:19:20.233 --> 1:19:21.484
Krista.

1:19:31.911 --> 1:19:34.831
What? What?

1:19:34.914 --> 1:19:37.667
You shot him in the back.

1:19:37.792 --> 1:19:39.335
Nothing happened to you.

1:19:43.798 --> 1:19:46.300
Hey, Krista.

1:19:46.384 --> 1:19:48.261
Stop. Stop.

1:19:48.344 --> 1:19:50.513
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1:19:50.555 --> 1:19:52.390
Krista, stop it! What
do you want me to say?

1:19:53.224 --> 1:19:54.684
Look, I...

1:19:56.394 --> 1:19:58.813
Don't, don't, don't.

1:19:58.938 --> 1:20:01.399
Don't ruin this for me, okay?

1:20:03.526 --> 1:20:04.861
- Ruin this?!
- Krista...

1:20:04.944 --> 1:20:06.529
Okay. Stop. Stop it.

1:20:06.571 --> 1:20:09.240
- Wrong!
- Stop. Stop it.

1:20:09.323 --> 1:20:10.533
Let go of me!

1:20:10.575 --> 1:20:13.661
Don't you touch me, don't.

1:20:15.455 --> 1:20:16.539
Stop.

1:20:19.417 --> 1:20:21.752
Hey, what are you doing?

1:20:21.836 --> 1:20:24.547
What are you doing? Let go of me.

1:20:24.630 --> 1:20:27.967
Hey, just stop. Krista, let go.

1:20:28.009 --> 1:20:30.720
Hey, stop.

1:20:33.097 --> 1:20:36.267
Cut it out, Krista, stop it.

1:20:36.309 --> 1:20:38.352
Let go.

1:20:38.436 --> 1:20:40.271
Stop it, please, let go.

1:20:40.354 --> 1:20:42.982
I'm sorry, Krista.

1:20:43.024 --> 1:20:45.902
I'm sorry, okay? Let go of me, I'm sorry.

1:20:48.738 --> 1:20:50.573
Get off of her now! Get off of her.

1:20:53.075 --> 1:20:57.330
Guys, I didn't do anything, she made me.

1:23:28.481 --> 1:23:30.566
Beast, beast, ready to act.

1:23:30.650 --> 1:23:32.610
Beast, beast, ready to act.

1:23:32.735 --> 1:23:34.612
Beast, beast, ready to act.

1:23:34.737 --> 1:23:36.364
Beast, beast, ready to act!
