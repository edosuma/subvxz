01:02.563 --> 01:03.610
Agh!

03:09.398 --> 03:13.369
- It's him, it's Dad. He's here.
- That'll be him now, Nelly.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.577
- Here.
- About time, I've been worried.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.824
Good lad.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.914
Dad! I've been waiting for you.
Have you got my things?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.540
- Have you got my whip?
- Easy, Cathy, hold on.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.087
Did you get my Whip?

03:28.709 --> 03:30.256
- Slow down.
- Where have you been?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.095
- There you are, sir.
- Joseph.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.965
Mr Earnshaw, sir.
We were worried, what with t'weather.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.639
You're soaked through.
Come and sit by t'fire.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.806
Get yourself warmed up, sir.

03:38.927 --> 03:40.770
Hold on.
I've got a surprise for you.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.774
Leave him.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.199
I found him in the street.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.909
Well, he had no one.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.957
- So I thought...
- What'?

04:08.707 --> 04:11.210
It was the Christian thing to do.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.727
Say hello.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.767
- Fairydog!

04:26.892 --> 04:29.736
Shame on you, Catherine Earnshaw!
Go on!

04:37.027 --> 04:39.450
Nelly, can you clean him up?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.669
Let go! No.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.506
Give me the jacket.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.723
Just fuck off, Fairydog.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.516
You ungrateful little...

06:58.084 --> 06:59.131
Sleep well?

07:03.882 --> 07:04.929
Move.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.871
Are you hurt?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.498
Can you understand me?

08:21.543 --> 08:22.760
Come.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.343
Come on!

10:20.245 --> 10:21.462
Come on!

11:45.872 --> 11:47.749
That's a hen harrier.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.393
That's a moorcock.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.828
That's a lapwing, my favourite.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.760
You say it. Lapwing.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.179
Lapkwing.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.597
Lapwing.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.029
"For I will take you
from among the heathen"

14:23.154 --> 14:25.498
"and gather you out of all countries"

14:25.615 --> 14:28.539
"and will bring you into your own land."

14:30.411 --> 14:35.042
"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you
and ye shall be clean."

14:36.084 --> 14:40.260
"From all your filthiness
and from all your idols,

14:40.380 --> 14:42.053
will I cleanse you."

14:43.633 --> 14:44.885
And what will be his name?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.185
Heathcliff.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.606
Heathcliff, do you reject Satan?

14:53.726 --> 14:54.818
Come on.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.613
No, lad.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.403
Don't struggle, now.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.029
Be still.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.421
Hey, Heathcliff. Heathcliff!

15:28.302 --> 15:29.645
Cathy?!

15:30.430 --> 15:31.898
Cathy!

15:37.103 --> 15:38.400
Cathy?!

15:42.024 --> 15:43.492
He's gone.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.320
Close your eyes.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.239
Come on, it's nice.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.078
Open your mouth.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.739
Heathens.

17:17.078 --> 17:19.422
- God forgive you both. Eh?
- But we didn't...

17:19.539 --> 17:21.212
Get to your room and shut up!

17:21.332 --> 17:23.380
I don't want to see you again tonight!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.359
Steady!

18:37.283 --> 18:38.330
Come on.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.461
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:40.870 --> 18:41.917
Hey!

18:52.882 --> 18:54.976
- Steady.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.562
Which one would you like, Heathcliff?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.810
Eh? You need your own.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.457
- The grey.
- Excellent.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.415
Hindley, you can have the other.

19:28.751 --> 19:29.798
Come on.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.342
- Come on.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.856
There's something wrong.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.991
I think he's lame.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.052
Where you going?

20:28.602 --> 20:30.320
Give me your horse.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.903
Fuck off, you dog.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.491
Want me to show him what you do?

20:49.832 --> 20:50.799
I'll tell him.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.169
Take my horse, then, you damn gypsy.

20:53.294 --> 20:56.594
I hope it breaks your neck
and kicks your fucking brains out.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.949
Let me see.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.205
I'm sorry.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.303
You know, I've tried to teach you.

21:44.512 --> 21:47.231
Tried to show you
how to be a good Christian.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.519
I'd hoped you'd have treated him
like he was your brother.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.738
He's not my
brother, he's a nigger.

21:54.605 --> 21:56.983
You leave me no option, lad.
Hold your hand out.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.324
Hand out!

21:58.442 --> 21:59.489
Out!

22:13.415 --> 22:15.668
Now get out of me sight.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.451
I hope you don't feel pleasure at this.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.004
Hey, look at me.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.538
Joseph!

23:31.577 --> 23:32.874
Come here!

23:45.174 --> 23:47.051
- Here we are, lad.
- Give it here.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.929
- Grab that.
- Look after yourself, Hindley.

23:53.599 --> 23:56.318
An education'll be the making of you, lad.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.146
- Go on.
- Take care, sir.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.648
Safe journey, lad.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.901
- In you get.
- Bye, Hindley.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.323
- Bye, Hindley.
- Mind how you go.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.982
Ow!

26:14.740 --> 26:16.617
- Dad!
- Cathy!

26:21.872 --> 26:23.249
Bad child.

26:24.041 --> 26:27.671
How can I love you?
I regret the day that you were born.

26:30.047 --> 26:33.142
Go on, both of you.
Go and get out of those wet clothes.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.306
- Hey!

26:39.431 --> 26:41.525
And ask God to forgive you both.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.371
Sing for us, Cathy.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.209
Why can't you always be
such a good lass, Cathy?

29:14.628 --> 29:17.757
Why can't you always be
such a good man, Father?

29:51.540 --> 29:52.792
What the devil were that?

29:53.792 --> 29:55.920
Go see to it, Heathcliff.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.992
Just go! Go and fetch the doctor!

30:27.117 --> 30:28.744
Will you just go now, woman?!

30:33.498 --> 30:35.592
Right, Cathy. Come on, out!

30:35.709 --> 30:36.926
Come on!

30:40.088 --> 30:42.216
No, I'm not leaving my dad!
- Cathy!

30:42.341 --> 30:45.390
- Cathy, get upstairs, will you?
- No! No! No!

30:45.510 --> 30:47.638
Heathcliff! Take Cathy upstairs!

30:47.763 --> 30:48.889
Now!

30:50.891 --> 30:53.394
Let me see my dad!

32:34.578 --> 32:36.046
It's Hindley.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.336
He's got someone wi' 'im.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.962
Hello, Hindley.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.303
- Hey, good girl.
- You're home. Who's her?

32:47.424 --> 32:49.518
Here we are, love.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.393
Well... welcome home, sir.

33:00.187 --> 33:01.985
Joseph, meet my wife, Frances.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.699
- Pleasure to meet you, madam.
- Hello, Joseph.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.537
You must both be cold and hungry
after all that, so let's get you inside.

33:08.653 --> 33:11.953
- This is my sister, Cathy.
- Nice to meet you.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.041
Who's this, Hindley?

33:14.159 --> 33:15.206
Heathcliff.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.001
- Come and help with the bags. Take 'em in.
- Hindley!

33:18.121 --> 33:20.044
Don't start, Cathy. I'm in charge now.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.963
Come on, let's go in.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.046
- Did you hear me?
- Don't be so hateful, Hindley.

33:26.171 --> 33:27.798
Your choice, nigger.

33:27.923 --> 33:29.675
Work or leave.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.641
Cathy.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.393
Come on, choose. I'm waiting.

33:36.515 --> 33:38.893
Come on, Cathy. Let's go inside.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.519
Get the trunk.

33:43.939 --> 33:45.156
When you've done that,

33:45.273 --> 33:48.402
get your stuff and move in
with the animals where you belong.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.074
You're a fucking idiot, Hindley.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.698
Things are gonna change round here.

33:56.159 --> 34:00.539
"He shall cover thee with his feathers
and under his wings shalt thou trust."

34:01.540 --> 34:04.259
"Thou shalt not be afraid
of the terror by night,"

34:04.376 --> 34:06.595
"not by the arrow that ï¬‚ieth by day,"

34:06.711 --> 34:09.806
"nor for the pestilence
that walketh in darkness,"

34:09.922 --> 34:11.469
"nor for the destruction..."

34:28.275 --> 34:30.152
I think they're the new people.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.574
How do? Afternoon.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.766
Is that the young black
Earnshaw found in Liverpool?

34:57.887 --> 35:00.140
Might make some improvements.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.235
- Still got trees to pull up then?
- Outside.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.898
Bring this place up to date.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.488
Aye, it needs it.

35:15.488 --> 35:17.616
That'll do, Heathcliff.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.785
Heathcliff.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.750
Heathcliff!

36:43.535 --> 36:45.037
Heathcliff!

36:51.292 --> 36:52.669
Heathcliff!

36:52.794 --> 36:54.171
I'm done here.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.639
- Come on!
- The two of you will go to hell!

36:56.756 --> 36:58.258
See you there, Joseph.

36:59.634 --> 37:00.886
Useless, he is.

37:01.386 --> 37:03.309
- Quick.
- Good for nothing!

37:13.440 --> 37:14.987
You eat like a pig.

37:18.570 --> 37:19.742
Ow!

37:46.097 --> 37:49.601
No, it's not his fault,
I made him stop working!

37:49.934 --> 37:51.652
Hindley, he's our brother!

37:51.770 --> 37:53.818
Don't be stupid, look at him.

37:55.190 --> 37:56.407
Stop it!

37:56.524 --> 37:57.491
Cathy, go away!

37:57.609 --> 37:59.657
You get off me!

37:59.778 --> 38:01.075
Get off me!

38:01.196 --> 38:02.948
You... No! No!

38:03.072 --> 38:06.451
You know if our dad were still here,
he'd see what a hateful bastard you are

38:06.576 --> 38:08.670
and he'd be ashamed of you!

38:10.079 --> 38:13.925
- Leave him alone!
- Even the animals work round here.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.760
You're here to work!

38:15.877 --> 38:17.299
You'll work!

38:59.170 --> 39:01.343
You OK, my love?

39:24.863 --> 39:26.365
Let me see your back.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.282
Isn't that where the new
people live, there?

40:52.951 --> 40:54.578
That big house?

40:59.290 --> 41:00.963
Race you there.

41:45.795 --> 41:47.217
Come on.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.088
It's my dog It's ours.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.800
It's my dog. Get off him!

42:27.920 --> 42:29.422
What idiots.

42:32.717 --> 42:33.843
Father!

42:35.762 --> 42:36.854
Father!

42:40.266 --> 42:42.894
Somebody's got me! Run!

42:43.019 --> 42:45.272
- Cathy!

42:48.441 --> 42:50.614
Get off!

42:51.027 --> 42:52.904
Skulker, get away!

42:53.571 --> 42:54.823
Go on, get away! Get away!

42:57.617 --> 42:59.665
Get out! Go on! Get out!

42:59.786 --> 43:01.880
- Come on, lass.
- Cathy?

43:07.960 --> 43:09.177
Robert?

43:09.295 --> 43:10.763
Skulker's had a lass, sir.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.599
There's a lad here too,
a right out-and-outer.

43:27.772 --> 43:29.024
Just a boy.

43:30.066 --> 43:31.818
We should hang you now,
before you get any older.

43:31.943 --> 43:32.990
Do the county a favour.

43:33.111 --> 43:34.454
Fuck you all, cunts.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.165
It's Cathy Earnshaw.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.626
I heard her brother lets her run wild.

43:40.743 --> 43:42.495
And you're the boy
Earnshaw got from Liverpool.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.167
The little lascar. The stowaway.

43:44.288 --> 43:46.256
That makes sense.
Did you hear his language?

43:46.374 --> 43:49.753
- You set the dog on us. Stupid whore.
- Robert, throw him out.

43:50.461 --> 43:52.805
And send someone to fetch Dr Kenneth.

43:53.339 --> 43:54.932
- Girls, fetch some water...
- Cathy!

43:55.049 --> 43:56.517
And brandy.

43:57.885 --> 43:58.886
Get out!

44:04.725 --> 44:06.602
Would you like one?

44:22.827 --> 44:24.500
How do, Kenneth?

44:39.552 --> 44:40.678
Go on.

44:56.611 --> 44:58.284
Hindley's looking for you.

45:11.709 --> 45:12.961
Heathcliff!

45:17.882 --> 45:19.384
I should beat you.

45:20.760 --> 45:23.263
When Cathy comes home,
you are not to speak to her.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.060
Is that clear'?

45:34.732 --> 45:37.110
If I see you talking to her
without my permission,

45:37.235 --> 45:38.908
you will be told to leave.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.254
Hindley, I need you.

45:49.705 --> 45:52.675
You know, I think it's good that
Cathy's going to go stay with the Lintons.

45:52.792 --> 45:54.260
It'll do her good.

46:58.357 --> 46:59.700
I prefer the Moorcock.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.993
I've got a big collection of it at
home and I've got lots of lapwing feathers.

47:06.157 --> 47:09.286
You'd like it at the Heights.
It's different to here though.

47:53.329 --> 47:54.706
Joseph!

48:07.176 --> 48:09.895
Look at you! How smart!

48:11.555 --> 48:13.228
Joseph, grab the reins.

48:17.937 --> 48:22.363
What a wonderful dress.
We hardly recognised you.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.574
I've got him, I've got him.

48:25.694 --> 48:28.573
- Hold him while I get down.
- I've got him.

48:29.448 --> 48:31.576
Been quiet round here without you.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.755
Come on, then, let's get you in.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.785
Cathy!
Look at you! You're a beauty.

49:06.902 --> 49:08.825
- Hindley!
- Don't she look well?

49:08.946 --> 49:10.539
Cathy, I love this dress.

49:10.656 --> 49:13.159
- Isabella gave it to me.
- Aren't you lucky?

49:13.284 --> 49:14.877
I said a stay at the Lintons'
would do her good.

49:14.994 --> 49:17.793
Where's Heathcliff? Where is he?

49:17.913 --> 49:20.291
He's somewhere. I saw him earlier.

49:22.251 --> 49:24.299
- Tea, anyone?
- Yes, please.

49:26.464 --> 49:27.716
Heathcliff!

49:31.093 --> 49:32.436
God's sake.

49:43.272 --> 49:44.774
Aren't you pleased to see me?

49:47.234 --> 49:48.986
Are you laughing at me?

49:49.111 --> 49:50.988
Didn't mean to laugh.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.704
All you have to do is wash and clean up

49:54.825 --> 49:56.452
and you won't look so bad.

49:56.994 --> 49:59.042
You do look dirty.

50:02.291 --> 50:03.508
You didn't have to touch me.

50:03.959 --> 50:05.006
Heathcliff?

50:13.511 --> 50:14.854
I like being dirty.

50:31.695 --> 50:34.369
I can help make you look smart,
if you like.

50:38.702 --> 50:41.421
If you come now,
I can sort you out before dinner.

51:36.468 --> 51:39.472
I want to be good.
Can you clean me up?

51:40.264 --> 51:41.481
That's more like it.

51:42.349 --> 51:45.899
The Linton's are coming today.
We'll have to get you clean like that Edgar.

52:11.295 --> 52:12.512
Let me see.

52:14.673 --> 52:17.472
Look at you. You're a prince.

52:19.136 --> 52:22.390
I bet your mother was an African queen...

52:22.514 --> 52:24.642
and your father a Chinese emperor.

52:26.268 --> 52:29.989
I think somebody must have kidnapped you
and brought you to England.

52:46.538 --> 52:49.508
- Hello, Edgar. Hello, Isabella.
- Hello.

52:52.336 --> 52:54.714
- So you got here all right, then?
- Yes.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.808
Just need a hand.
We've got some barrels.

52:59.551 --> 53:02.896
- There we go.
- Nelly's been cooking all morning.

53:04.181 --> 53:05.808
You do like goose, don't you?

53:07.518 --> 53:09.486
Goose, my favourite.

53:13.565 --> 53:15.283
Right, it's this way.

53:16.860 --> 53:17.861
Come on.

53:32.918 --> 53:34.511
That looks nice, Nelly.

53:35.504 --> 53:37.177
You sit there.

53:39.174 --> 53:41.268
Look at this. This looks nice.

53:41.385 --> 53:43.183
Well, look at you, Heathcliff.

53:43.721 --> 53:44.688
Get out!

53:44.805 --> 53:47.900
Look at him, he's all dressed up
like a little circus monkey.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.278
- Get out!
- Heathcliff!

53:52.396 --> 53:54.273
You idiot-
You should have just spoken to him.

53:54.398 --> 53:56.901
He'll be beaten now.
I hate it when he's beaten.

53:57.568 --> 53:58.865
Get off him!

54:01.405 --> 54:02.907
Get off him!

54:06.493 --> 54:08.291
Hindley! No!

54:08.412 --> 54:10.460
Stop it, Hindley!

54:15.961 --> 54:17.429
Off him, Hindley.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.350
Heathcliff.

54:23.385 --> 54:25.513
Oi! What's going on?
What's he done now?

54:25.637 --> 54:28.356
Take him in.
I don't want to see him. Lock him up.

54:29.391 --> 54:32.144
Get up, lad. Get up!

54:49.787 --> 54:50.959
Come on.

54:53.540 --> 54:54.666
Here we are.

55:15.896 --> 55:17.022
Heathcliff?

55:34.748 --> 55:36.421
Can you hear?

55:38.502 --> 55:40.220
The band's here.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.316
Are you hurt?

56:50.032 --> 56:52.410
He should be back now.

57:14.097 --> 57:16.816
Nelly! Nelly, come quick!

57:16.934 --> 57:19.733
- The baby's coming!
- Tell Hindley.

57:19.853 --> 57:22.106
And get Dr Kenneth. Quick!

57:43.627 --> 57:45.846
Oh, it's coming, it's coming!

57:45.963 --> 57:47.010
I can't...

58:00.060 --> 58:02.563
That's it. Just breathe.

58:03.271 --> 58:04.272
Push.

58:08.402 --> 58:11.747
It's coming, it's coming.
I can see its head.

58:13.031 --> 58:15.875
"Blessed be the name of the Lord."

58:15.993 --> 58:19.793
"I will keep my mouth,
as it were a bridle."

58:19.913 --> 58:23.167
"While the ungodly was in my sight,."

58:23.291 --> 58:26.010
"I held my tongue and spake nothing."

58:27.087 --> 58:32.639
"I kept silence, even from good words,
but it was pain and grief to me."

58:34.052 --> 58:38.683
"My heart was hot within me,
and while I was musing the fire kindled."

58:38.807 --> 58:41.481
"At last I spoke with my tongue."

58:42.769 --> 58:45.363
"Lord, let me know mine end"

58:45.480 --> 58:47.278
"and the number of my days."

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.594
Breathe in. Stand still.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.507
That's a good girl.

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.722
Do I look nice, Nelly?

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.316
Lovely.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.582
Hold still.

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:10.959
Are you going anywhere?

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.337
- It's raining.
- Why you wearing that, then?

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.509
Aren't you supposed to be working?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:17.716
No.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:20.802
Joseph will tell.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:24.773
He will never know. He's not here.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.360
Nelly, you're brushing
all t'curls out my hair.

01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.864
- Up you come.

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.488
Oh!

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:54.252
What were you saying?

01:01:54.377 --> 01:01:56.300
You spend more time with them than me.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.349
- As if I'd notice.
- I notice.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:04.471
You never have anything to say.
May as well play with the baby.

01:02:06.598 --> 01:02:08.896
You never complained before.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.278
I've not come too soon, have I?

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.992
No.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.087
Edgar?

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.679
Please don't go. Please, come back in!

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:45.141
Please come back.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.765
Just come back in. Please.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.194
It's all right.

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.547
Can you keep a secret?

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.092
I don't like secrets.

01:05:24.045 --> 01:05:26.093
Edgar's asked me to marry him.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:32.303
I said yes.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.932
Did I do wrong?

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.102
Do you love him?

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:41.605
I do.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.817
He's handsome, cheerful and rich.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.033
And he loves me.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:50.076
Then why are you so unhappy?

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:56.415
Here and here.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.337
Wherever t'souls live, I feel I'm wrong.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.974
If only Hindley didn't
bring Heathcliff so low,

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.389
I wouldn't even think of marrying Edgar.

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:16.389
But now it would degrade me
to marry Heathcliff.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:24.481
And he will never know how much I love him.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.992
Not because he's good looking, but...

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:35.538
because he's more myself than I am.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:27.460
Heathcliff!

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:35.723
Heathcliff!

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:45.479
Heathcliff!

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.947
Uh!

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.187
Is Cathy here?

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.919
What the fuck'?

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.842
Is she here?

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.512
She married Linton.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.932
Where you stopping?

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.559
I've got a room for cheap.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:40.425
Nelly.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.058
Heathcliff!

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.597
Is it you?

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:48.722
Is she here?

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:53.105
She's the lady of the house now.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.103
Edgar's parents are long dead.

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.697
Go on and tell her someone
wants to see her.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.691
We wondered what had happened to you.

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:02.820
- Nelly... please.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.891
Cathy!
Bring the person in, then, love!

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.729
Hold on, I'll go tell him.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.880
I know you don't like him

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:43.924
but you must be friends
with him now for my sake.

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:45.262
Try to behave.

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:49.384
The whole household need not see you
welcome a runaway servant as a brother.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:00.152
Please, sit down.

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.545
I'll ask them to bring the tea through.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.293
Nelly?

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.890
I won't believe this tomorrow.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.471
How I saw you...

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.803
and touched you...

01:14:33.928 --> 01:14:35.396
Spoke to you.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:44.442
How could you not think
of me all this time?

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:47.992
You thought of me too, it seems.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:50.862
I'd just heard you got married.

01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:04.754
My plan was

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.174
to see your face,

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:09.972
get revenge on Hindley...

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.010
and then kill myself.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.685
But I have changed my mind.

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.896
I'll never leave you,

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.190
ever again.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.240
My life has been bitter
since I last heard your voice.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.700
I kept going only for you.

01:15:46.042 --> 01:15:48.716
Are we to let the tea go cold,
then, Cathy'?

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:55.726
Cathy?

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:03.560
Will you stay for tea, Mr Heathcliff?

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.696
Mr Heathcliff?

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:12.614
Yes, Mr Linton.

01:16:12.735 --> 01:16:14.203
Thank you, I will.

01:16:21.744 --> 01:16:23.417
So where will you stay?

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:27.587
Hindley offered me a room, I'll take it.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:31.011
I'll come tomorrow then.

01:16:39.011 --> 01:16:40.263
Cathy?

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:42.523
Don't catch cold now.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.735
Good night.

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:16.174
Go on. Go on.

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:18.050
You must think
I'm as daft as a turnip.

01:17:18.175 --> 01:17:20.428
Go on.
Get that card up your sleeve.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:25.057
Is that your last one in, right?

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.694
Oi! Get off!

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.407
Get off!

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:22.702
Fuck off. You idiot!

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:53.001
You've done well for yourself.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.006
By murdering and thieving, no doubt.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.050
Your only skills.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.135
I'm gonna need the rent in advance.

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:14.773
Hiya, Joseph.

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.822
I'm not staying long.
Just go and get Heathcliff for us.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.952
Heathcliff!

01:20:26.363 --> 01:20:28.081
I'll need receipts.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:45.842
Mrs Linton.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.052
Don't.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:04.702
You remember Isabella? Edgar's idea.

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.322
Hello, Heathcliff.

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:09.948
Isabella.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.951
It's been a while.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:14.707
Shall we go?

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:49.909
Isabella, will you stay with the horses?

01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.078
I want to show Heathcliff something.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.500
Heathcliff...

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.300
help me down.

01:22:10.092 --> 01:22:11.344
Thank you.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:17.247
How could you have left this?

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:27.670
How could you have left me?

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:46.856
Can we go now?
It's starting to rain.

01:23:51.818 --> 01:23:53.491
We're just coming.

01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:17.098
- Again.
- I need another card.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.619
Come on! Come on.

01:25:11.315 --> 01:25:12.612
Nelly!

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.416
- Is this wise?
- Will you please let her know I'm here.

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:23.206
Life was just fine before you came back.

01:25:23.327 --> 01:25:25.830
Heathcliff, I thought I heard your voice.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.252
Come in, I'll just go get my stuff.

01:25:29.082 --> 01:25:30.504
Cathy, don't run!

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:47.476
Hello.

01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:01.327
You must have some stories to tell.

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:03.867
Stories?

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:07.121
Well, you've been gone a while.

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:10.124
You changed.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:12.842
We were all wondering.

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.175
There is nothing I want to remember.

01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:19.175
Come on, you're being modest.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:20.846
I am not.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:42.531
I'm ready.

01:26:45.826 --> 01:26:46.873
Thank you.

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:09.270
Are you going out again?

01:27:09.891 --> 01:27:11.393
Yes.

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:12.610
Please be careful.

01:27:13.395 --> 01:27:14.567
I will.

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.240
Take Isabella with you.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.405
Yes, I'd love to join you.

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:21.244
Of course.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:23.239
She's welcome.

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:12.333
Maybe you can persuade Heathcliff
to tell us of his adventures, Catherine.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:15.628
Stop bothering him
with all these questions, Isabella.

01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:28.850
You've not said much, it's true.

01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:30.848
It's gone.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.111
There's only now.

01:28:39.648 --> 01:28:42.652
Well, maybe Catherine can
share her news instead.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.403
Isabella.

01:28:46.363 --> 01:28:47.660
What news?

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:49.331
Nothing.

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:52.126
It's not important.

01:31:00.956 --> 01:31:03.459
You are just the person we need
to thaw the ice.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:20.233
Isabella likes you more than me, it seems.

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.779
Don't go!

01:31:26.982 --> 01:31:30.703
- Heathcliff, could you ask Cathy to let me go?
- She's not eaten in two days.

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:32.071
She's lovesick.

01:31:32.654 --> 01:31:33.746
Ah!

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.701
- What a tiger.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.502
Were you telling the truth?

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:51.051
What do you think?

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:40.188
I need more money.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:43.725
My rent's paid for a year.

01:32:47.896 --> 01:32:49.569
I need more.

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.661
You can have whatever you want.

01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:01.743
But I'll need something in return.

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.290
Take whatever you want.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.584
You always wor a thieving nigger.

01:34:04.013 --> 01:34:05.515
Isabella?

01:34:09.811 --> 01:34:11.313
I should go in.

01:34:12.272 --> 01:34:13.740
Is it true?

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:53.605
Ah!

01:34:59.611 --> 01:35:01.113
I should go now.

01:35:36.689 --> 01:35:38.362
What were you thinking?

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:41.240
What's it matter to you?

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:43.238
You've no right to be jealous.

01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:46.616
I'm not your husband.

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:52.418
Do you like her?

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:56.759
You've treated me so badly, Cathy.

01:35:58.962 --> 01:36:00.930
You think you can be nice

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:04.093
and everything'll be OK.

01:36:07.929 --> 01:36:09.602
What do you mean?

01:36:09.722 --> 01:36:11.395
I ain't treated you badly.

01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:23.244
What's going on?

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.830
Nothing.

01:36:25.947 --> 01:36:28.666
I put up with you coming here
because my wife likes you.

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:31.286
No more, please get out.

01:36:31.411 --> 01:36:32.958
What taste you have, Cathy.

01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:38.293
You prefer this shivering coward
over a man like me.

01:36:39.377 --> 01:36:40.629
Enough.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.056
This can't go on.

01:36:44.507 --> 01:36:46.350
You have to choose, Cathy.

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:47.935
Him or me.

01:36:52.265 --> 01:36:55.144
Your veins are full of ice, Edgar.

01:37:09.782 --> 01:37:10.954
Robert!

01:37:24.714 --> 01:37:25.840
You best go.

01:37:25.965 --> 01:37:27.763
Come with me.

01:37:30.803 --> 01:37:32.851
I'll raise the child as my own.

01:37:34.766 --> 01:37:35.983
Don't...

01:39:41.809 --> 01:39:43.311
OK.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:37.092
Joseph.

01:41:39.176 --> 01:41:41.270
It's true then. You are married.

01:41:41.887 --> 01:41:44.481
Lord bless us. Lord forgive us.

01:41:45.933 --> 01:41:47.480
- Come on.
- Hello, Hareton.

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:50.313
Shall we be friends?

01:41:50.438 --> 01:41:52.691
Frame off or I'll set me dog on you.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:55.492
Joseph.

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:10.796
What news of Cathy these last weeks?

01:42:11.751 --> 01:42:14.254
She's paying for her wickedness.

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:17.678
God has passed judgment.

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:20.472
- Is she sick?
- Since you left.

01:42:20.593 --> 01:42:22.766
Weeks of fever and delirium.

01:42:22.887 --> 01:42:24.639
Brought it on herself, Nelly says.

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:16.487
Heathcliff.

01:43:58.524 --> 01:44:00.276
Is she dead yet?

01:44:14.373 --> 01:44:16.842
Get off! Get off!

01:44:21.881 --> 01:44:24.600
No! Get off!

01:46:18.289 --> 01:46:20.257
Cathy.

01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:46.108
You and Edgar have broken my heart.

01:46:47.359 --> 01:46:49.032
You killed me.

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:07.755
Will you be happy when I am in the earth?

01:47:09.882 --> 01:47:11.555
Will you forget me?

01:47:16.597 --> 01:47:18.315
Don't torture me!

01:47:26.774 --> 01:47:28.697
I have not killed you.

01:47:28.817 --> 01:47:31.445
I could no more forget you than myself.

01:47:34.531 --> 01:47:36.158
When you're at peace,

01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:39.583
I shall be in hell.

01:47:43.791 --> 01:47:45.634
I will never be at peace.

01:47:56.637 --> 01:47:58.310
Don't go.

01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:00.103
Come back.

01:48:01.976 --> 01:48:03.649
Don't be mad.

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:19.744
Cathy.

01:49:01.410 --> 01:49:02.662
Cathy.

01:49:19.887 --> 01:49:21.355
Help her.

01:49:22.723 --> 01:49:24.066
On, Cathy.

01:49:27.352 --> 01:49:30.276
Cathy, my love. Wake up.

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:33.901
Can you hear me?
Wake up. Look at me.

01:49:35.861 --> 01:49:37.613
Cathy, look at me.

01:50:57.151 --> 01:50:58.494
She's dead, in't she?

01:50:59.987 --> 01:51:01.455
Yes.

01:51:04.992 --> 01:51:07.495
Senses never returned since you left.

01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:12.045
- May she wake kindly in the other world.

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:13.634
May she wake in agony.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:17.425
Aagh!

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:22.601
Don't leave me here where I can't find you.

01:51:43.197 --> 01:51:44.915
Leave me alone.

01:51:48.660 --> 01:51:49.661
Leave me alone!

01:56:00.245 --> 01:56:02.339
It will all be over by now.

01:57:42.264 --> 01:57:43.516
Cathy.

01:58:23.763 --> 01:58:26.437
- Open the door!
- Hindley said he'll kill you if I let you in.

01:58:26.558 --> 01:58:28.777
I'll kill you both if you don't!

01:58:28.893 --> 01:58:32.989
Heathcliff, if I were you, I'd stretch myself
over Cathy's grave and die like a dog!

01:58:33.106 --> 01:58:35.655
Life can't be worth living
for you now, can it?

01:58:35.775 --> 01:58:36.742
Yam.

01:58:52.042 --> 01:58:54.761
Stop it! Get Off!

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:04.930
Stop! Get off!

01:59:16.775 --> 01:59:19.904
Cathy would still be alive
if it wasn't for you.

01:59:24.574 --> 01:59:26.201
I hate you!

02:01:18.605 --> 02:01:20.528
This all seems to be in order.

02:01:21.816 --> 02:01:25.195
Looks like you're the legal owner
of the farm, Mr Heathcliff.

02:01:40.168 --> 02:01:41.636
Good day, Mr Heathcliff.

02:03:17.974 --> 02:03:20.068
<i>Enemy)</i>

02:08:48.888 --> 02:08:51.482
<i>I am Heathcliff.</i>
