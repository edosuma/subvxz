00:01.720 --> 00:02.960
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

00:03.040 --> 00:05.725
I want to talk about your colleagues
in the tech area.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.961
Why don't you ask Frank?

00:07.040 --> 00:08.485
You were the best student I ever had.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.040
And you know that I would back you
to the edge of the Earth.

00:11.120 --> 00:13.361
- You are a biologist?
-Botanist.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.044
Here, I'm just a physicist's wife.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.164
Too many great minds have been forced
to abandon their work.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.641
<i>What a pity it would be to lose another.</i>

00:20.720 --> 00:22.848
<i>It's an artificial hive.
I wanna study them.</i>

00:22.960 --> 00:25.008
Okay, suspicious words and phrases
updated hourly.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.048
You hear any of these words,

00:27.120 --> 00:30.010
you're gonna press this button
and security will hop on the line.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.491
<i>There's something I need to tell you.</i>

00:31.560 --> 00:33.483
We're building a weapon.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.891
No <i>ingl√©s.</i>

00:35.600 --> 00:37.011
<i>You read a paper of mine.</i>

00:37.080 --> 00:38.844
"New Approach
to Nuclear Cosmology."

00:38.920 --> 00:41.446
- Right.
- Your approach wasn't new.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.962
You're a self-righteous old man
on his professional deathbed.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.771
Akley might not know what you really are,
but I do.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.162
<i>It's KPS community radio.</i>

00:51.280 --> 00:55.001
<i>On our first day of broadcast on the Hill,
we take you to a distant land.</i>

00:55.080 --> 00:57.367
<i>It can't be found in any atlas.</i>

00:57.440 --> 00:59.044
<i>This is</i> Memories of You.

b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

01:20.960 --> 01:23.042
- I know your secret.
- Mmm-hmm?

01:25.280 --> 01:28.045
Don't tell your girlfriends.

01:28.120 --> 01:30.248
I don't want their husbands
stealing my technique.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.731
That's not what I'm talking about.

01:36.760 --> 01:40.446
For the last few weeks,
you've been home for dinner every night.

01:40.520 --> 01:44.286
You've barely set foot in the tech area
over the weekend.

01:47.320 --> 01:51.530
We're going back to Brookline.
The project's winding down.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.648
Niels Bohr helped you finish it, didn't he?

01:53.720 --> 01:55.609
We're not winding down, Abby.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.328
We're just getting started.

02:01.800 --> 02:04.246
Then what is it? You love your job.

02:04.320 --> 02:06.004
It's complicated.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.084
Yeah, I'm glad we're not going just yet.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.122
My job's quite fun actually.

02:15.200 --> 02:19.888
Not that they're gonna give a switchboard
girl a Nobel Peace Prize, but...

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:14.080 --> 04:15.161
Did she die?

04:17.360 --> 04:20.125
Looked like you might have
been sputtering out back there.

04:21.720 --> 04:22.801
The engine's fine.

04:24.640 --> 04:26.290
I'm a bit of a shade tree mechanic.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.488
You want me to take a gander
under the hood?

04:29.760 --> 04:31.569
I should be on my way.

04:33.200 --> 04:36.329
Something special for the old lady?

04:36.400 --> 04:39.927
Mine wants an electric blender
for her birthday.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.922
Like I'm Andrew Carnegie.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.689
Anyway, you drive safe.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.405
You double-checked
the center of gravity on the alignment rod?

06:11.480 --> 06:13.482
I told you it's good.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.806
You look a little out to lunch is all.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.529
Better pull it together
before the presentation.

06:20.320 --> 06:21.606
Ante up.

06:22.760 --> 06:25.809
A buck for the betting pool.
How many Krauts we're gonna vaporize.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.850
I don't gamble.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.770
Shh! Here it comes.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.610
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

06:43.720 --> 06:47.167
This is Frank Winter.
I need an outside line. Indiana.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.047
Is that Chanel No. 5?

06:57.120 --> 06:58.565
I thought they stopped shipping that.

06:58.640 --> 07:03.282
Oh, my mother planned ahead.
Emptied the pantry and filled it with bottles.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.565
The Nazi flag is flying over Paris,

07:05.640 --> 07:09.565
and the thing she fears most
is running out of perfume.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.166
<i>How's that sweetheart of yours?</i>

07:15.480 --> 07:16.891
Can't complain.

07:16.960 --> 07:21.409
<i>Pretty thing like her, I wouldn't either.
Big man on campus.</i>

07:21.480 --> 07:23.881
<i>- Your classes good?</i>
- Same old.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.850
World buys new shoes,
academia digs in its heels.

07:26.920 --> 07:30.288
<i>Now, Frank, have you figured out
what you're gonna do when you graduate?</i>

07:31.920 --> 07:34.287
<i>God bless you. What, are you sick?</i>

07:35.640 --> 07:37.165
It's just a cold.

07:37.240 --> 07:39.607
<i>Well, just get yourself a good winter coat.</i>

07:40.200 --> 07:44.808
<i>Young men like you
need a good coat and a sharp razor.</i>

07:44.880 --> 07:46.644
<i>How's that sweetheart of yours?</i>

07:46.720 --> 07:49.200
She's good. She's good.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.084
I'd better get going.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.286
Happy birthday, Pop.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.125
Gesundheit.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.685
- Oh, old man's birthday, huh?
- Eighty eight years.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.884
He'll bury all of us.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.200
Did you talk to him?

08:14.280 --> 08:17.443
He thinks I'm an undergrad at Columbia.

08:17.520 --> 08:20.364
Silver lining is he doesn't remember
what a son of a bitch he used to be.

08:20.440 --> 08:24.240
Well, space-time is curved.
Maybe we're all living in the past, huh?

08:25.200 --> 08:29.330
Good to know at least one senior citizen
has his faculties intact.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.241
Ham on rye.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.243
Want me to cut the crusts off for you, kiddo?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.528
Our task was to present a prototype

08:41.600 --> 08:45.366
with an ignition system
that's not only functional but reliable.

08:45.440 --> 08:50.810
We've incorporated
redundant triggering mechanisms

08:50.880 --> 08:54.248
that must all agree
before the propellant is fired.

08:54.320 --> 08:58.006
This ensures that detonation occurs
at the optimal altitude,

08:58.080 --> 09:01.243
maximizing blast radius
and guaranteeing the...

09:04.800 --> 09:10.921
Guaranteeing the most efficient destruction
of targets both hard and soft.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.364
It'll never fly.

09:15.080 --> 09:16.684
The ignition system?

09:16.760 --> 09:18.967
The plane. Too goddamn heavy.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.846
Major, maybe you haven't accounted

09:21.920 --> 09:24.764
for the weight removed
from the B-29's three gun posts.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.966
You haven't accounted for fuel.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.010
The weight and balance specs
don't include petrol.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.088
Gassed up, the B-29 tips 26 tons heavier
than when it rolls off the assembly line.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.606
Try to fly that thing,
she'll wind up in the drink.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.885
I wasn't informed.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.566
That airplanes run on gas?

09:42.640 --> 09:45.211
Bottom line is
you're no closer to a deliverable weapon

09:45.280 --> 09:46.645
than you were two weeks ago.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.930
How the hell are we supposed
to cut 800 pounds?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.241
It's a modified cannon. Cannons are heavy.

09:56.320 --> 09:58.721
They have to be,
or they bust apart when you fire them.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.247
Turns our Jesus can't walk on water after all.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.164
Don't worry about it, Chuck.
We mortals have more fun anyway.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.641
We're talking
about 2,000 years of ballistic science.

10:07.720 --> 10:09.165
Have another drink.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.526
I've had plenty.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.126
Well, your little oversight
set us back two weeks.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.202
What's one more night, huh?

10:16.960 --> 10:18.769
I didn't order that.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.769
Heard you caught a bad beat
with our friends over in ordnance today.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.082
Got to put that cannon of yours
on a diet, huh?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.811
Compartmentalization.
I can't really talk about it.

10:38.440 --> 10:43.765
You know, I had a neighbor once.

10:43.840 --> 10:47.561
Big beefcake of a guy.
Couldn't please his wife.

10:48.720 --> 10:50.370
So he hatches a theory.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.922
If he screws her more often,
eventually, she'll whistle like a teakettle.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.480
So he drives home from work for a nooner.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.882
He wakes her up at 3:00 a.m.
He runs in from mowing the lawn.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.246
Bam! Zoom...

11:01.560 --> 11:02.891
Nothing.

11:02.960 --> 11:07.409
So, one day, the wife's home alone.
Ding-dong. Salesman.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.731
He's peddling ice boxes.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.847
Now, I don't know
how this slick shrimp does it,

11:13.920 --> 11:16.764
but five minutes later,
they are making like a corkscrew.

11:18.040 --> 11:22.568
And right out of the gate, she goes kaboom.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.167
It turns out,

11:27.240 --> 11:31.768
all she needed was one good bang.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.043
Son of a bitch.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.009
Is he talking about my wife?

11:39.080 --> 11:42.004
Christ, you really are
off your game. "One good bang."

11:42.080 --> 11:44.003
He's talking about Thin Man.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.321
Two thousand years of ballistic science

11:46.400 --> 11:49.768
only apply if your cannon
needs to fire more than once.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.286
We want our cannon
to bust apart.

11:53.160 --> 11:55.003
It only has to fire once.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.243
So it can be thinner and lighter.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.604
That old jalopy's
still got some fuel in his tank.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.808
He could teach you
how to give the goods to your old lady.

12:03.880 --> 12:06.486
Yeah, like I need sex tips from a Commie.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.928
What did you say?

12:12.240 --> 12:14.641
- Just trying to help.
- Like you helped Richard Lavro?

12:19.440 --> 12:21.283
Good night, gentlemen.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.686
Babbit's a Communist?

12:25.760 --> 12:28.286
- How do you know?
- He's friends with Richard Lavro.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.643
Glen Babbit has been part of this project
since there was a project.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.530
He slept in a tent for two weeks
when we had no place else to put him,

12:45.600 --> 12:47.045
and he never complained.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.207
Besides, he's a Jew.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.681
This is not a man
who's passing secrets to the Germans.

12:51.120 --> 12:54.010
You're focused on today's problem.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.730
I'm talking about tomorrow's.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.609
You can't swing a dead animal up on this hill

12:57.680 --> 13:00.331
without hitting some genius
who attended a Communist rally.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.482
Including Robert Oppenheimer.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.769
Yes, but Oppenheimer
never knew Richard Lavro.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.289
The physicist's physicist.

13:09.360 --> 13:11.681
Made some of the key discoveries
in quantum theory.

13:11.760 --> 13:16.448
Tenured at Harvard until October, 1939
when he disappeared.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.046
Sounds like you've been
reading too many ghost stories.

13:19.120 --> 13:22.203
Richard Lavro is not a ghost. He's a defector.

13:22.880 --> 13:26.009
In '39, he sailed from New York to London,
then London to Moscow.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.731
Now he directs a group
in laboratory number two

13:28.800 --> 13:31.724
in the Academy of Sciences,
the Soviet Manhattan Project.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.802
What does any of this have to do
with Glen Babbit?

13:33.880 --> 13:37.601
The USSR is a frozen cow pasture.
They barely have indoor plumbing.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.763
Yet somehow, this country that
has to import its elevators from Yonkers

13:40.880 --> 13:43.611
has a nuclear program
that's riding up your ass.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.081
And you think Babbit gave
Lavro our nuclear research?

13:46.160 --> 13:48.970
Gave, is giving, will continue to give.

13:50.040 --> 13:51.121
Last time you had a theory,

13:51.200 --> 13:54.761
I ended up with a dead mathematician
and a 10-page bill for fencing.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.961
And you want to disrupt
the crucial work that's happening here

14:00.040 --> 14:04.170
because you're waging a war
against a country that's technically our ally?

14:04.280 --> 14:05.930
Technically.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.729
I expect your full cooperation.

14:08.400 --> 14:12.166
And I expect the full cooperation
of your staff.

14:12.240 --> 14:16.211
Nobody thought to ask Babbit about
any of this during his intake interview?

14:17.120 --> 14:19.521
He claimed he never spoke to Lavro.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.962
I lied. I met him
at the Solvay Conference in '33.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.328
We ran into each other at a couple
of symposiums over the next few years,

14:29.400 --> 14:30.640
but that's all.

14:32.720 --> 14:35.166
- He was a good physicist.
-And an active Communist.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.720
Well, 10 years ago,
so were half the scientists in America.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.370
It wasn't an issue.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.926
Well, it becomes an issue
when you lie during your security interview.

14:42.560 --> 14:46.281
Well, I got jittery.
Any connection to Lavro looks bad.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.647
I didn't think
anybody was gonna call me on it.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.848
Maybe Isaacs was
at one of those conferences.

14:50.920 --> 14:53.526
Saw you two talking to each other.

14:53.600 --> 14:55.807
A drunken kid says
something stupid in a bar...

14:55.880 --> 14:58.121
Yeah, and I hear about it
from the security office.

14:59.600 --> 15:02.683
Did you ever talk to Lavro about fission?

15:02.760 --> 15:04.285
Of course not.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.523
Anybody comes to you with questions,
you stonewall them. Stick to your story.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.602
- Jesus, Frank.
- You never met him.

15:10.720 --> 15:12.529
I'm not as good a poker player as you.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.881
Well, you lied to get in here.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.242
You can certainly do it again.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.725
I'll find out what the kid knows.

15:20.800 --> 15:21.961
Leave it alone, Frank.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.727
We got the plutonium. We got real work to do.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.962
- It'll all blow over.
- Just like Sid Liao?

15:28.320 --> 15:31.881
There's no breeze here, Glen.
Things don't blow over.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.086
Liza.

15:54.360 --> 15:58.763
So these are your pets
everyone's buzzing about?

15:58.840 --> 16:03.801
Well, they won't bring you your paper,
but they won't bite the postman either.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.846
Here. This was mixed in with ours.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.930
I didn't peek.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.370
So, you can see why the journal sent it back.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.330
I mean,
I know the censors have to be vigilant,

16:30.400 --> 16:32.323
but if you took even a cursory glance,

16:32.400 --> 16:36.121
you'd see that nothing and by subject matter
is classified.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.564
I study plants.

16:39.640 --> 16:45.044
In this case, the pollination preferences
of the <i>Apis mellifera.</i>

16:46.120 --> 16:47.963
The European honey bee.

16:48.800 --> 16:49.847
Interesting critters.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.526
I always thought
they were only good for ruining picnics.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.649
- Mrs. Winter...
- Dr. Winter.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.964
Scientists are prohibited from publishing
during their tenure in the Manhattan District.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.287
I don't have a tenure here,
and I'm not employed on the Project.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.203
But you are a scientist.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.167
Captain, I sacrificed my job

17:08.240 --> 17:11.483
to come here with my husband
because his work is crucial to the war effort.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.961
Mine is not, but it is crucial to me.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.445
Says here you studied in France.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.491
During college, yes.

17:20.599 --> 17:22.682
Well, I was in France, too.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.330
Not the Sorbonne, but the Argonne.

17:29.160 --> 17:32.448
You know what I remember most? The food.

17:32.520 --> 17:35.729
Because that's what you do in a war,
make the best of it.

17:37.280 --> 17:41.604
Before you go, Dr. Winter, your bees...

17:42.880 --> 17:45.121
There have been some complaints.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.324
Strategic bombing.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.325
Six thousand civilians on detonation.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.323
Ours will be 50 times more powerful.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.125
So suddenly you care
about collateral damage?

18:11.200 --> 18:14.090
You didn't seem to at the PX last night.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.647
I had a lot to drink. Tell Dr. Babbit I'm sorry.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.405
Don't say another word to anyone.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.720
Don't even think his name.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.643
Jesus, relax. I apologize.

18:23.720 --> 18:24.881
You think I give a shit?

18:24.960 --> 18:27.884
G-2 shakes your tree,
you make sure nothing falls.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.329
You want me to lie to military intelligence?

18:30.400 --> 18:33.165
You saw two men
who can think circles around you

18:33.240 --> 18:36.050
just talking shop at a conference.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.124
There's no conspiracy.
Just a figment of your imagination.

18:40.680 --> 18:44.924
I worked as the staff assistant
at the Physics Department at Harvard.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.650
Answered phones, ran the mimeo.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.247
I'm sure your parents were very proud.
You just keep your mouth shut.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.967
And I delivered mail.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.283
One day, an envelope shows up for Dr. Lavro.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.089
It wasn't sealed.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.969
Yeah? Sounds like you're the one
G-2 should be interested in.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.730
It was a ticket to London on the Cunard Line.

19:08.800 --> 19:11.201
So what? He defected from London.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.803
It wasn't for Lavro.

19:18.520 --> 19:22.002
His had already arrived,
same sort of envelope.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.680
The ticket was in Babbit's name.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.885
Fritz, let me borrow that French letter
you keep in your drawer.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.883
You can't borrow a condom.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.486
- Anyway, I already used it.
- Rubbish.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.370
I've seen you gaze wistfully at it
every day since the Army handed it out.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.408
Meeks got one too. Take his.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.450
Meeks is in Albuquerque
with a chorus girl from The Wizard of Oz.

19:54.520 --> 19:57.888
Tin Man's probably getting
his joints oiled as we speak.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.086
Meeks has a girlfriend?

19:59.840 --> 20:03.128
Only a true miser
hides a resource he'll never need.

20:04.240 --> 20:05.765
See you later.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.209
Is everybody getting laid but me?

20:12.280 --> 20:14.806
It's just sex, Fritz.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.451
Is it because I'm husky?

20:17.520 --> 20:20.171
Orson Welles is overweight.
The papers say he married Rita Hayworth.

20:20.280 --> 20:22.009
How long's it been?

20:23.280 --> 20:25.089
- A little While.
- Fritz.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.491
Twenty nine years, 11 months, 19 days.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.601
Then let's call this an early birthday present.

20:41.680 --> 20:45.162
Should we put on the radio or something?

20:45.240 --> 20:46.207
What? Oh, no.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.044
- You're not gonna do it in my room.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.645
Get over here.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.564
Um... Her, her, not her.

20:52.640 --> 20:54.927
The one with the bob,
she charges by the minute.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.004
That's a good deal if you're a quick draw
and you like short hair.

20:58.080 --> 21:00.686
Wait. You want me to sleep with a...

21:01.480 --> 21:03.244
They're all whores?

21:04.280 --> 21:08.444
They're capitalists. It's basic economics.
Supply and demand.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.603
I took econ at Cornell.
This definitely wasn't on the syllabus.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.160
These girls make five dollars a week
at the lunch counter,

21:14.240 --> 21:17.562
but they're walking around
with gold mines under their skirts.

21:17.640 --> 21:20.371
I always thought
it would be with someone special.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.170
Jeannie's special. She plays the bassoon.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.561
Huh.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.800
At least she cleans her sheets.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.848
Why don't you tell me again?

21:30.920 --> 21:34.641
You met Richard Lavro in 1933.
You ran into him at a conference or two.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.644
Maybe three. Physics is a small pond.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.245
But you didn't really know him?

21:39.360 --> 21:42.045
That's why you lied
during your security interview,

21:42.120 --> 21:44.088
because the fact that you met him
wasn't really relevant.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.606
To our work here, it wasn't.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.650
I met Charles Lindbergh once.
Doesn't make me a fascist

21:50.480 --> 21:52.448
or an airplane pilot.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.931
You know how G-2 operates.

21:54.040 --> 21:58.523
If they sniff blood in the water,
if there's any whiff of impropriety...

21:58.600 --> 22:00.762
But you lied to me, too.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.846
You're lying right now.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.840
What did Isaacs tell you?

22:11.880 --> 22:13.644
A ticket to London.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.723
That's what he saw.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.690
I'm not a Communist, Frank.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.606
The ticket was in your name.
It was delivered to Lavro.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.251
Jesus. I've never even been to London.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.164
So some travel agent
made a clerical mistake?

22:30.960 --> 22:32.485
Isaacs has imagined this whole thing?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.166
They're gonna come after you.
You better get your story straight.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.605
I didn't get on any boat.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.808
But you were going to.

22:38.880 --> 22:41.804
Did you help him defect?
Are you passing him information now?

22:41.920 --> 22:42.967
No.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.169
Then why was your name on that ticket?

22:46.240 --> 22:47.924
- Frank.
- Why?

22:50.400 --> 22:51.925
You know why.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.007
You know.

23:05.080 --> 23:09.244
He asked me to leave with him.

23:09.320 --> 23:13.120
He thought the ticket would convince me.

23:16.760 --> 23:19.127
He wanted to start a new life.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.163
He was naive.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.804
We both were.

23:28.680 --> 23:34.005
But I have never betrayed my country.

23:43.760 --> 23:45.410
You were married when I met you.

23:50.040 --> 23:51.929
That was a long time ago.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.361
From three major publications a year
to zero.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.604
It's like Agatha Christie.
One day, she vanished.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.327
Don't you think those sons of bitches
are gonna give my career

24:08.400 --> 24:10.767
a funeral with full honors?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.171
I'm sorry.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.242
Well, I'm gonna keep on typing,

24:17.320 --> 24:21.689
and they can keep on redacting,
and eventually, they'll run out of ink.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.687
Can you tell me what's wrong?

24:32.840 --> 24:36.287
I had a disagreement with Glen.

24:38.200 --> 24:42.285
The sort that would ruin
a perfectly good weekend in Cape May?

24:42.360 --> 24:46.046
No, this is different.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.930
Glen lent us his car for our honeymoon.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.800
And he sat in the waiting room
at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital

24:52.880 --> 24:55.406
for 10 hours when I was in labor.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.962
Whatever it is, apologize and be done with it.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.964
I don't even know who I'd be apologizing to.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.646
The man's not who you think he is.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.802
He's been lying to me
since the day I met him,

25:08.880 --> 25:10.564
since the day we met his wife.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.484
Glen's never lied to me.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.409
And everyone deserves a little privacy, Frank.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.765
He told you?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.604
He didn't have to.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.123
You know, in all these years,

25:36.200 --> 25:40.489
there's only ever really been one bone
of contention between Glen and me.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.409
You know what it is?

25:44.400 --> 25:46.243
No matter what you do,

25:47.280 --> 25:49.248
he refuses to judge you.

25:56.440 --> 26:00.286
<i>Under each arm,
the sandman has an umbrella.</i>

26:01.920 --> 26:05.083
<i>One of them is covered in colorful pictures,</i>

26:06.480 --> 26:09.324
<i>of all the wondrous things in the world.</i>

26:10.120 --> 26:13.886
And this umbrella, he puts
on the headboards of the good children,

26:13.960 --> 26:16.964
so they will dream
wonderful stories all the night through.

26:21.120 --> 26:24.169
The other umbrella has no pictures.

26:25.440 --> 26:29.047
<i>It's black and frayed, and wires poke out.</i>

26:30.920 --> 26:35.801
<i>The children who get this umbrella
toss and turn all night long,</i>

26:36.960 --> 26:38.530
<i>for they are very bad.</i>

26:41.160 --> 26:43.640
<i>And when they wake in the morning,</i>

26:44.640 --> 26:46.290
they haven't dreamed anything.

26:52.480 --> 26:55.848
They haven't dreamed anything at all.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.685
Shall we begin?

27:15.360 --> 27:18.921
Some gentlemen from Washington
paid Glen Babbit a visit last night.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.890
- It wasn't a social call.
- What did Babbit tell them?

27:21.960 --> 27:22.961
That's not my business.

27:23.040 --> 27:25.361
What matters now
is that you tell them the truth.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.761
They pulled your security file this morning.
Due diligence.

27:27.840 --> 27:29.205
They're gonna put you on record.

27:29.280 --> 27:32.966
Whatever you know about Babbit,
you have to protect yourself.

27:33.040 --> 27:35.691
And what if Babbit is not a Communist?

27:37.040 --> 27:39.771
You know, when I was a boy,

27:39.840 --> 27:43.003
my old man, first snow,

27:44.720 --> 27:46.131
he'd stick a Winchester in my hand.

27:46.200 --> 27:49.568
He'd drag me out to the woods
to shoot a whitetail.

27:50.560 --> 27:54.884
We'd sit there all day freezing our stones off.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.731
You see, my old man refused to go home
without a kill.

28:00.600 --> 28:04.924
I read Babbit's work in college.
He is an underappreciated scientist.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.810
- He's one of the best around.
- And you want me to shoot him?

28:07.880 --> 28:11.123
Charlie, you're not the hunter here.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.006
These men will not go back to Washington
without a trophy.

28:19.080 --> 28:22.880
And if they can't bag a deer,
they will settle for a grouse.

28:26.840 --> 28:29.002
You got a brilliant career ahead of you.

28:32.800 --> 28:37.010
Don't throw it away
by lying to protect the wrong man.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.445
I need a word.

28:47.240 --> 28:51.086
I'm submitting my resignation.
I'll talk to Oppenheimer.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.451
They came by my house.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.282
What did you tell them?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.204
The last four months, the Army's been trying
to take us behind the woodshed.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.442
I am not giving them any more ammunition.

29:01.520 --> 29:02.521
What did you say?

29:02.600 --> 29:04.364
I stuck with my story, just like you told me to.

29:04.440 --> 29:05.441
But it doesn't matter,

29:05.520 --> 29:07.443
because sooner or later,
they're gonna talk to the kid.

29:07.520 --> 29:10.126
It's better to resign now
for the good of the group.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.850
You are the group.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.769
Frank, at some point,
we all need to pay for the sins of the past.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.730
- I am out of ration stamps.
-Not accepted.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.962
It won't be up to you when Isaacs talks.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.321
You let me worry about Isaacs.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.971
The kid already said he's gonna sing.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.689
Well, I'll try a new approach.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.965
She fixed you up with a painted lady?

30:02.040 --> 30:04.008
Our Helen?

30:05.640 --> 30:07.847
I underestimated both of you.

30:07.920 --> 30:12.164
And lo, Prometheus gave man
the gift of fire.

30:12.240 --> 30:14.208
Yep, it was hot.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.170
So which one of them was it? Lucy? Peg?

30:18.040 --> 30:20.691
- I don't kiss and tell.
- Please.

30:20.760 --> 30:24.367
Shall I just check the infirmary
for young ladies with crush wounds?

30:24.440 --> 30:26.363
I'd look for the girl
with the biggest smile on her face.

30:26.440 --> 30:29.046
Whoever she is,
her moans kept me up half the night.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.329
Sorry if we made too much of a racket.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.088
Cut the shit.
I'll tell you why I was up all night.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.810
Comforting poor Jeannie.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.690
She said you ran away
before she could even get your trousers off.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.285
No, that's not true.

30:48.360 --> 30:51.648
You knocked over her lamp on the way out.
I heard the bulb break.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.405
Look, Helen, the truth is...

30:54.480 --> 30:57.848
I don't want to hear it, Fritz.
You just pay her the $2.25.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.928
But I didn't have sex with her!

31:01.200 --> 31:03.202
And we agreed on $2 flat.

31:03.280 --> 31:06.011
Yeah, well, the extra quarter
is for the light bulb.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.650
You like it?

31:16.320 --> 31:18.163
The music on the radio.

31:18.240 --> 31:20.288
- Music.
- Music.

31:20.960 --> 31:23.770
You know, we could teach each other.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.729
God knows I need your help
with my Spanish.

31:34.600 --> 31:38.764
Do you know what a post office is?
There's one in the pueblo.

31:39.280 --> 31:40.691
Post office?

31:41.440 --> 31:42.441
Um...

31:43.640 --> 31:45.005
<i>El correa?</i>

31:45.720 --> 31:48.087
<i>- El correo.
- Correo.</i> I'm sorry.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.485
Do you think

31:53.240 --> 31:55.686
that you could post that for me?

31:59.320 --> 32:01.243
Do you understand?

32:14.960 --> 32:19.887
- Operator.
- I need an outside line. Indiana.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.527
Let there be light.

32:55.440 --> 32:59.889
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.803
I brought your money, too.

33:03.800 --> 33:04.926
Here.

33:07.360 --> 33:11.285
I've had customers cross the finish line
in 10 seconds flat.

33:11.360 --> 33:14.330
You're the first guy
who didn't make it to the starting gate.

33:14.400 --> 33:17.847
I just remembered
an equation I hadn't written down,

33:17.920 --> 33:19.160
and I didn't want to forget it.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.528
You whiz kids. Always in your heads.

33:25.720 --> 33:27.563
You deserve some fun every once in a while.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.051
You know,

33:34.400 --> 33:36.528
as long as you're paid up...

33:41.880 --> 33:43.370
Uh...

33:45.440 --> 33:48.683
<i>Have you seen The Mummy's Tomb?</i>

33:48.760 --> 33:50.683
It's playing at the PX.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.086
How much does it cost
to take you to the movies?

34:05.160 --> 34:06.810
Joey asleep?

34:14.600 --> 34:15.806
You didn't...

34:17.520 --> 34:20.524
You didn't steal something, did you?

34:20.600 --> 34:24.286
I stole you away from the most eligible
Jewish bachelors in Brookline.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.451
But you would never cheat, right?

34:31.239 --> 34:33.607
What are you talking about?

34:33.679 --> 34:35.125
I don't know.

34:36.920 --> 34:40.367
I got Frank Winter an outside line today.

34:40.440 --> 34:44.809
And on the call, he said
that you took work from other scientists

34:44.880 --> 34:46.643
and published it as your own.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.208
Well, that's bullshit, Abby.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.490
Frank Winter's had it out for me
ever since we got here,

34:58.560 --> 34:59.891
'cause he's jealous,

34:59.960 --> 35:03.806
'cause I've accomplished more in
a few months than he has in almost a year.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.328
Tell me exactly what he said.

35:09.480 --> 35:11.642
He was talking to his father.

35:11.720 --> 35:12.721
Mmm-hmm?

35:13.520 --> 35:15.284
But he said he might go to Oppenheimer.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.121
He said one conversation,
and your career would be finished.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.363
And I was so upset I had to come home.

35:21.440 --> 35:22.771
He wasn't talking to his father.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.684
He was talking to you,
trying to get in my head.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.608
- So you would never...
- Plagiarize?

35:30.680 --> 35:31.841
How could you even ask me that?

35:32.560 --> 35:35.450
- Jesus, Abby.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.362
- I've never even cheated on my taxes.
- No, you haven't.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.205
- Now you don't trust me?
- Of course I do.

35:46.440 --> 35:47.601
Hey.

36:13.920 --> 36:16.685
Was that supposed to scare me?
Shut me up?

36:16.760 --> 36:19.650
You come into my house
with your bullshit accusations.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.484
You toy with my marriage?

36:22.240 --> 36:25.210
You don't know me.
You don't know where I'm from.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.806
You ever talk to my wife again, I will kill you.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.289
So classical four-dimensional
general relativity

36:33.360 --> 36:35.647
combined with the nuclear forces

36:35.720 --> 36:41.124
can explain the relative abundances
of all known elements in the universe?

36:43.240 --> 36:45.208
You finally looked at my paper.
Congratulations.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.489
I looked at it when I rejected it
from the <i>Physics Review</i> a year ago.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.204
But that line wasn't a line from your paper.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.726
It was a line
from a 1932 graduate dissertation

36:52.800 --> 36:55.485
by a cosmologist named Pierre Brajeux.

36:56.280 --> 37:00.683
It was sadly under-read, but I read it
in the stacks of Widener Library at Harvard,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.046
and so did you.

37:02.120 --> 37:05.841
Science is a conversation.
We all stand on the shoulders of giants.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.651
The rest of us don't pretend
to be 1,000 feet tall.

37:10.800 --> 37:13.451
- It's one sentence.
- It was a paragraph.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.443
Step by step, word for word.

37:17.360 --> 37:21.046
So you've been sitting on this for a year
waiting for what?

37:21.120 --> 37:24.806
Let me tell you what's gonna happen now.
You're gonna fall on your sword.

37:24.880 --> 37:29.761
You're gonna tell G-2 that you don't know
the first damn thing about Glen Babbit.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.486
It was copied into my notebook.

37:36.800 --> 37:41.966
I didn't even realize I'd taken concepts
from Brajeux until the paper was published.

37:42.040 --> 37:43.041
I would have gotten there on my own anyway.

37:43.120 --> 37:45.600
- It was an honest mistake.
-That you could have easily corrected.

37:45.680 --> 37:49.366
Imagine you wrote a paper
that opened every door in academia.

37:49.440 --> 37:51.488
And it wasn't a fluke.
You had the goods to back it up,

37:51.560 --> 37:54.803
but you accidentally borrowed a piece of it.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.326
- I think the word is plagiarism.
-One paragraph, not the whole paper.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.721
Not even the lion's share.

37:59.800 --> 38:02.485
Just a building block. Just a stepping stone.

38:04.040 --> 38:05.963
And nobody noticed.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.680
Would you come clean?

38:12.000 --> 38:14.970
Doesn't matter what I would do.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.204
All that matters is what you do
once you leave this office.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.962
My wife wouldn't even look me in the eye
last night.

38:52.400 --> 38:53.606
God...

39:09.400 --> 39:10.845
Excuse me.

39:11.760 --> 39:13.922
How's your lunch, Captain?

39:15.680 --> 39:16.806
Making the best of it?

39:16.880 --> 39:19.486
Dr. Winter, we're in the middle of a meeting.

39:19.560 --> 39:22.723
- I'm afraid you...
- You are afraid, aren't you?

39:23.760 --> 39:25.250
Battle-scared warrior,

39:25.320 --> 39:28.005
and all it takes to scare you
is a woman with half a brain.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.846
If I could make an exception
to the publication policy, I would.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.924
But they're dead, all of them.

39:35.680 --> 39:37.842
- But you know that, don't you?
- What?

39:39.160 --> 39:41.242
Wasn't it enough for you to kill my career?

39:41.920 --> 39:43.968
- Who's dead?
- My honey bees.

39:44.360 --> 39:45.566
On.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.961
This is the broad with the bees.

39:49.400 --> 39:54.122
Is there anything here
that you really care about, Captain?

39:54.760 --> 39:57.366
Maybe you have a scruffy little mutt
who sleeps on your feet

39:57.440 --> 39:59.329
at the end of your bed over on Officers Row,

39:59.400 --> 40:03.291
and you leave him tied up out back
when you come here to work.

40:03.360 --> 40:07.604
Wouldn't it be a riot if some rat poison
found its way into his cute little bowl, hmm?

40:08.600 --> 40:11.080
I don't have a dog, lady.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.204
And I'm not the exterminator.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.406
Get a hold of yourself.

40:28.560 --> 40:34.806
You were at the PX. Is that right?
Drinking at the bar in the PX?

40:36.280 --> 40:37.361
That's correct.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.250
And as the clerical assistant
in the Physics Department at Harvard,

40:40.320 --> 40:43.642
did you ever work for Richard Lavro?

40:43.720 --> 40:45.131
I worked for all the professors.

40:45.200 --> 40:48.044
And at the PX, you made mention

40:48.120 --> 40:52.489
that Dr. Babbit had an acquaintance
with Dr. Lavro.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.050
Is that right?

40:57.800 --> 41:01.725
Do you have knowledge
that Dr. Babbit knew Lavro?

41:01.800 --> 41:04.246
I never met Glen Babbit
until I joined the project.

41:04.320 --> 41:05.731
But you do have reason to believe

41:05.800 --> 41:10.931
that Dr. Babbit had an association
with Dr. Lavro,

41:11.000 --> 41:16.245
that he may have shared
sensitive information?

41:34.560 --> 41:37.291
I don't know what you did.

41:37.360 --> 41:39.840
I'm not sure I want to.

41:39.920 --> 41:45.006
But apparently, Isaacs barely remembers
the name Richard Lavro

41:45.080 --> 41:47.208
or any connection to me.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.843
We can't remember something
that never happened.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.004
You know the irony?

42:07.840 --> 42:11.925
In the Soviet Union,
they actually enforce the laws against...

42:13.200 --> 42:15.328
Against it.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.243
Five years hard labor.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.611
I heard he married some girl half his age.

42:28.280 --> 42:32.046
He thought this country could be better.
We all did,

42:32.120 --> 42:33.531
but I swear,
if I'd known he was gonna defect...

42:33.600 --> 42:36.570
You don't have to explain yourself to me.

43:49.200 --> 43:52.090
- Music.
- That's right, music.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.287
After I got back from the war,

44:00.000 --> 44:03.607
I met a guy,
let me crash in the back of his repair shop.

44:04.720 --> 44:09.123
He didn't know anything about radios,
so I fixed them all.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.083
He's with her again.
