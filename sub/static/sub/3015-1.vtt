00:10.428 --> 00:11.846
<i>I just don't want
to make one of these tapes</i>

00:12.013 --> 00:13.765
<i>if it's something you do
with every girl.</i>

00:13.932 --> 00:18.520
Every girl? No, no.
I am strictly a one-woman guy.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.967
Well, I don't want to end up
all over the Internet.

00:20.980 --> 00:23.149
I pride myself on keeping a low profile.

00:23.316 --> 00:25.735
- My private life is private.
- Hm.

00:27.111 --> 00:31.157
Wait. I thought you never did this
before. What are all these?

00:31.324 --> 00:34.202
Oh, uh, just some movies I rented.

00:34.953 --> 00:36.074
"Me and Brandy, Missionary"?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.915
A tale of two girls who become nuns.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.458
"Me and Brandy, Doggy"?

00:40.625 --> 00:44.128
The sequel. The nuns
adopt a chocolate lab.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.297
What are all those?

00:46.464 --> 00:47.799
Oh, that's just your standard

00:47.966 --> 00:50.343
home security setup.
Basic run-of-the mill.

00:50.510 --> 00:53.012
No big deal, nothing too elaborate.
Everybody has them.

00:53.179 --> 00:55.890
And why do you need security cameras
pointing at your bed?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.351
In case a burglar tries
to steal my sex tapes.

00:58.518 --> 00:59.769
Now, let's get into bed.

00:59.936 --> 01:02.536
Let's just make this quick.
I have a court hearing in the morning.

01:02.647 --> 01:05.441
- Judge Henderson?
- No. I wish. Thompson.

01:05.608 --> 01:07.694
Mm. That's going to suck for you.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.196
It was a driving mishap thingy.

01:10.363 --> 01:12.282
Do me a favor.
Promise me you won't drive.

01:12.448 --> 01:14.325
That's sweet.
You're worried about me driving.

01:14.492 --> 01:17.579
Mm-mm. I'm worried about me.
I'm a pedestrian.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.206
- Ow!

01:20.373 --> 01:22.834
Sorry. That's my sobriety monitor.

01:24.669 --> 01:25.670
- Ow!

01:25.837 --> 01:27.839
Sorry. Sorry.

01:28.006 --> 01:29.591
Ankle. Tracking bracelet.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.386
- Oh, wait. Wait. Sorry, just...

01:35.513 --> 01:37.557
- Who put that on you?
- I did.

01:37.724 --> 01:39.309
It's the only way
I can have an orgasm.

01:40.977 --> 01:42.937
- Not tonight.

01:51.321 --> 01:53.990
- What are you doing?
- Huh?

01:55.199 --> 01:58.244
Just... warming up.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.207
You sure we're alone here? Feels like
there's somebody else in this house.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.835
- Did you hear that?

02:06.002 --> 02:08.211
That's nothing.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.619
- OK, what is that?

02:09.672 --> 02:11.966
Just... unraveling the old hose.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.802
Save it for tomorrow, Raul.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.596
<i>Si, senor.</i>

03:31.087 --> 03:32.880
- Wow. That was amazing.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.219
Charlie.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.639
- Wow.
- Get out of here, Emilio.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.310
Charlie, I'm scared.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.437
Lindsay, sweetie,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

03:53.818 --> 03:56.178
<i>- Hey, I got the stuff.</i>
- I got to call you back, man.

03:56.821 --> 03:58.614
Ow!

04:06.998 --> 04:08.458
I think I better go.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.085
Really? How about tomorrow? You busy?

04:15.298 --> 04:18.009
I'm going to blow you
across the room.

04:18.176 --> 04:19.469
Sounds awesome.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.003
<i>And thus our story begins.</i>

04:54.170 --> 04:57.673
<i>The large reward offered
for the rescue of Charlie's kids</i>

04:57.840 --> 05:00.384
<i>drew the attention of police,
private detectives</i>

05:00.551 --> 05:02.929
<i>and Red Cross volunteers.</i>

05:03.095 --> 05:06.140
<i>Everyone was on high alert
for these children,</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:08.184
<i>except these two guys.</i>

05:08.351 --> 05:11.813
No, man, Obamacare gives senior citizens
access to cheaper drugs,

05:11.979 --> 05:16.108
free preventative care, and it closes
the Medicare Part D loophole.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.903
And how does that help if I get
shampoo in my dick hole?

05:19.070 --> 05:20.613
- What?
- Mean to tell me you ain't never got

05:20.780 --> 05:22.406
shampoo in your pee hole?

05:22.573 --> 05:24.075
- Maybe like once or twice.
- Yeah, once or twice

05:24.242 --> 05:25.827
when you was playing with yourself.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.745
No, I wasn't playing with myself.

05:27.912 --> 05:30.081
I was showering,
and crazy got up in there.

05:30.248 --> 05:33.084
Bullshit. Cam Newton's
law of gravity is:

05:33.251 --> 05:36.337
That thing must be up
in order for that soap to go down.

05:36.504 --> 05:39.340
Well, either way,
that shit stings like hell.

05:39.507 --> 05:42.176
Sting like a mother, man, it feel
like it's a hornet up in there.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.429
And he found out his girl be, you know,
doing her thing with another man.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.473
- Exactly.
- I don't understand why

05:47.640 --> 05:49.392
the shampoo company
can't fix that, man.

05:49.559 --> 05:51.102
They got "No More Tears."

05:51.269 --> 05:52.979
Why they can't make no more
hornets in your dick?

05:53.145 --> 05:56.941
I don't really think they expect you
to use the No More Tears on your dick.

05:57.108 --> 05:58.709
Well, why they call it
Johnson & Johnson?

05:58.860 --> 06:01.420
I got a better question, man.
What the hell are two stoners doing

06:01.487 --> 06:03.197
wandering around
these spooky-ass woods?

06:03.364 --> 06:06.742
Look, it's going to be worth it.
I told you... this is Humboldt County.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.996
This is where all the growers
grow their bomb-ass shit.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.206
You think they're gonna be cool
with us just helping ourselves?

06:12.373 --> 06:13.875
Look, man, we ain't taking no plants.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.161
We're gonna snip a few buds.
You know what I'm saying?

06:16.168 --> 06:17.753
It's gonna grow back
just like a lobster paw.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.171
You know, that's how nature do.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.018
I don't know, man.
Just doesn't feel right.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.493
Man, they ain't gonna care.
Look, man, we're gonna be cool.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.095
We're gonna roll one blunt,
then we're gonna get up out of here.

06:26.262 --> 06:28.180
- Just one?
- Just one.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.642
- They won't care, huh?
- Man, just keep running.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.937
Holy shit. Is that a drone? They're
going all <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> on our ass.

06:39.859 --> 06:41.694
Yo, I think they gone.

06:44.196 --> 06:48.659
Oh, whoa. It's a cabin in the woods.
We need to go hide over in there.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.161
Nah, man, I'm not going in there.

06:50.328 --> 06:51.537
It reminds me of a horror movie
I once saw.

06:51.704 --> 06:54.874
- What horror movie?
- The one with the cabin in the woods.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.542
<i>- Friday the 13th?</i>
- No.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.210
The one with the cabin in the woods.

06:58.377 --> 06:59.712
<i>Texas Chain Saw Massacre?</i>

06:59.879 --> 07:01.923
No, the one with the cabin
in the woods.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.466
<i>- The Ring.</i>
- Uh-uh.

07:03.633 --> 07:06.260
- The one with the cabin in the woods.
<i>- Blair Witch Project.</i>

07:06.427 --> 07:08.679
No, man, the one
with the cabin in the woods.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.556
- The Munsters.
- That wasn't in the woods.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.558
- They wasn't even a damn movie.
- Look, man,

07:12.725 --> 07:14.365
we ain't got time
for this shit right now.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.312
We need to get to that cabin
in the woods.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.788
- What the hell is that sound?

07:33.955 --> 07:36.666
Sound like the house settling.
It looked new.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.584
- I'm gonna take a look around.
- Go ahead.

07:42.088 --> 07:43.089
Ah! What is that?

07:49.762 --> 07:51.180
- Ah!
- Ow!

07:51.806 --> 07:54.558
Where we shooting?
- There.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.018
- Where?
- The dark!

07:56.185 --> 07:57.603
- There?
- No, this dark.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.355
Over there.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.402
Dude, what the hell was that?

08:04.568 --> 08:07.279
Big-ass Alaskan king crab
just ran up on me, man.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.073
- Crab? Cuz, we banging?
- Ja'Marcus,

08:09.240 --> 08:11.441
- put the guns down, man.
- Put yours down first, homey.

08:11.534 --> 08:14.829
All right, on three. One, two, three.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.623
- Damn.
- You want to try it again?

08:17.790 --> 08:20.960
Sure. One, two, three.

08:23.129 --> 08:24.714
One, two, three.

08:26.841 --> 08:30.720
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

08:30.886 --> 08:32.972
Man, we could do this shit all day.

08:33.139 --> 08:34.807
- Truce?
- Truce.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.477
Hey, yo, D'Andre. Look, homey.
It's two little girls.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.772
- They're little racist girls, man.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.151
Wearing blackface. Cool with that?

08:45.776 --> 08:48.738
- Hey, little girl, what's your name?

08:52.158 --> 08:53.659
- What'd she say?
- She said, "I wonder what your leg"

08:53.826 --> 08:55.119
- "tastes like."
- What? Ah, man!

08:55.286 --> 08:56.620
Little spider girl bit me.

08:56.787 --> 08:57.997
Maybe you're going to get superpowers.

08:58.164 --> 08:59.999
- Ain't no black superheroes.
- I'm on it.

09:00.166 --> 09:01.584
- Hi-ya!

09:04.336 --> 09:08.007
Yo. D'Andre, I think they're
the missing kids from the news.

09:08.174 --> 09:09.508
- How can you be so sure?
- Look.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.004
- I don't know, man.
- Well, if it is the missing kids,

09:13.054 --> 09:15.174
I'm gonna take that reward money,
and I'm gonna buy me

09:15.222 --> 09:18.225
a yacht, fill it with cash,
bitches and a shark.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.753
Why would you want to buy a shark?

09:19.894 --> 09:21.812
Trust me... we're gonna need a shark.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.195
No, this can't be right.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.335
Hi, Mom.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.921
I got to call you back.

09:48.047 --> 09:49.965
No baby, no baby, no baby, no baby.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.780
<i>- You're pregnant...</i>
- No!

09:52.802 --> 09:56.722
<i>...with anticipation over
the outcome of this iPregnancy test,</i>

09:56.889 --> 09:59.809
<i>which has determined that you are...</i>

09:59.975 --> 10:01.352
You got to be kidding me.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.230
Oh, no.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.940
<i>Not pregnant.</i>

10:06.107 --> 10:07.983
<i>You dodged a bullet, you lucky slut.</i>

10:08.150 --> 10:11.070
Thank you, God. Sweet!

10:12.321 --> 10:15.407
Great news: They found my brother's kids.

10:15.574 --> 10:16.826
Oh, crap.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.578
<i>We're very fortunate
the older one, Kathy, has retained</i>

10:19.745 --> 10:21.205
most of her vocabulary.

10:21.372 --> 10:23.499
The baby hasn't actually said a word.

10:23.666 --> 10:26.961
- Why not?
- Because he's a baby.

10:27.128 --> 10:30.548
They've been alone here
over three long months.

10:30.714 --> 10:35.344
I need to warn both of you
that this is not going to be easy.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.596
I'm ready for it.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.266
- Hello.
- No, no. Wrong window.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.935
Here's where the children are.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.650
- What is she doing?
- In order to survive

10:49.817 --> 10:53.279
their extreme isolation, the girls
created an imaginary guardian,

10:53.445 --> 10:57.658
a parent figure to feed them,
sing to them. They call her Mama.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.452
But these may help you break through.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.329
And the Ritalin may help, as well.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.748
The proper dosage
for someone their age is...

11:04.915 --> 11:06.208
Wish me luck.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.256
Hey, Lily.

11:18.304 --> 11:19.972
Oh, how cute.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.644
Kathy.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.731
It's OK, Kathy. Remember these?

11:28.898 --> 11:31.567
You used to wear them
to help you see better.

11:38.157 --> 11:39.658
No, no, no!

11:40.826 --> 11:43.829
Maybe we should get her
some contacts... the soft kind.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.001
Daddy?

11:49.919 --> 11:52.379
No, sweetheart. Not Daddy.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.173
I'm your Uncle Dan. Remember?

11:54.340 --> 11:55.758
And this is Jody.

11:55.925 --> 11:57.885
Jo... dy.

11:58.052 --> 12:00.888
Jody.
No pause between "Jo" and "dy."

12:01.055 --> 12:03.015
Jo... dy.

12:03.182 --> 12:05.601
Dan, we're at an impasse.
I see constant conflict.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.811
It's fine. They'll warm up to you.

12:07.978 --> 12:09.355
Ow!

12:09.521 --> 12:11.982
Hey, hey, hey, little lady,
that's not how...

12:12.149 --> 12:13.817
You little mother...!

12:17.446 --> 12:21.033
Well, everything checks out.
They seem like good kids, Doc.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.493
Just validate our parking.
We'll take them home.

12:22.660 --> 12:24.912
- Folks, I wish it were that easy.
- You don't validate?

12:25.079 --> 12:27.331
I'm saying the kids
are not yours to take.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.458
Well, you can't win them all.
Let's skedaddle.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.587
That's not fair. They're my brother
Charlie's kids. We deserve them.

12:33.754 --> 12:37.132
Do you? Your wife plays in a punk rock
band, staying out all night long,

12:37.299 --> 12:39.969
high on drugs, sleeping with
a different man every night.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.888
I don't think the courts
are gonna look upon that too favorably.

12:43.055 --> 12:44.348
- But...
- I was just messing with you.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.795
- The kids are yours.
- They are?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.494
Did you hear that, honey? They're ours!

12:47.518 --> 12:51.105
On one condition. This house is owned
by the Institute for Case Studies.

12:51.272 --> 12:53.315
Every room is fully wired with cameras.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.068
If you move into the house,
you get the kids.

12:56.235 --> 12:59.113
Can't we just sell the house and put
the kids in a high-end orphanage?

12:59.280 --> 13:01.490
Jody, do you really think
you're cut out to be a mom?

13:01.657 --> 13:02.658
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

13:02.825 --> 13:04.034
- Of course she is.
- Dan!

13:04.201 --> 13:07.121
Now, no more rock band,
no more silly wig.

13:07.288 --> 13:09.373
It's not silly. It's all a part of me.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.375
- And no more tattoos.
- What are you doing?

13:11.542 --> 13:14.169
What I had to.
We're a perfect suburban couple.

13:14.336 --> 13:19.091
<i>And so Dan and Jody headed to
their new house with their new children.</i>

13:19.258 --> 13:22.553
<i>But, like a slutty sorority girl
returning from spring break,</i>

13:22.720 --> 13:27.266
<i>they were also bringing home
a hidden evil.</i>

13:28.517 --> 13:31.145
All right, kids,
here's our new house.

13:31.312 --> 13:32.938
And here's Uncle Dan.

13:33.105 --> 13:36.275
Hi. Don't forget about mommy!

13:36.442 --> 13:40.237
Dan, I'm not their mommy.
They can call me Aunt Jody.

13:40.404 --> 13:42.656
- Or Jodes, J-Mom, Mrs. Sanders.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.583
Or, if they really want
to call me... Garage!

13:46.869 --> 13:48.370
Here comes Jody and Aidan,

13:48.537 --> 13:50.217
entering the house
for the very first time.

13:50.289 --> 13:53.917
This is where we're going to protect you
and make sure nothing bad...

13:54.084 --> 13:55.764
Oh, my God, Aidan!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.629
Maybe we should put him in the carrier.

13:57.796 --> 14:02.009
- There, see, that's better.
- Come on, Aidan. What, what, what?

14:02.176 --> 14:04.428
- Relax, it's OK.
- Oh, my gosh.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.430
- Dan, I lost the baby!
- What?

14:06.597 --> 14:09.391
Oh, my gosh, Aidan!
Aidan, where are you?!

14:09.558 --> 14:10.758
- Aidan!
- Where did you go?

14:10.851 --> 14:15.064
Oh, there he is, OK.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.107
Here's your sister Kathy.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.609
Oh, Aidan, it's OK.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.577
You've just got to talk
in a baby voice.

14:20.652 --> 14:23.822
It doesn't even matter what you say.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.158
I'm your stepmommy.

14:27.618 --> 14:30.037
I'm not your fricking mommy.

14:30.204 --> 14:32.456
- There you go, you're a natural.

14:32.623 --> 14:34.666
- What's that smell?

14:36.418 --> 14:39.254
Oh, my God, what do I do?
Oh, oh! Here, this, hold on!

14:39.421 --> 14:42.424
Uncle Dan!

14:42.591 --> 14:46.220
- Kathy! Oh, sorry!
- Ow!

14:46.387 --> 14:49.932
All right, there you go, sweetie.

14:50.099 --> 14:53.435
Is it chilly in here? I felt it
as soon as I entered the room.

14:53.602 --> 14:55.687
Feels fine. Hey, what are these?

14:55.854 --> 14:58.482
This is interesting. What is this?

14:58.649 --> 15:01.235
I don't know, Mama drew that one.

15:01.402 --> 15:04.113
Look, we drew this picture for Aidan.

15:07.324 --> 15:10.411
See? It's Aidan
on a rocket to the moon.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.581
- Oh. Sitting on a rocket.
- Where's Lily?

15:18.293 --> 15:20.379
Oh, no, sweetie, the other end.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.756
Ooh!

15:23.882 --> 15:26.176
Let's go introduce Aidan
to the rest of the family.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.390
Oh, and there's
our furry family member.

15:31.557 --> 15:34.101
- Yes, Maria.
- No, Dan, Artie.

15:34.268 --> 15:36.228
Oh, yes, of course, our dog Artie.

15:36.395 --> 15:39.314
- Ay, the new baby. I make blessing.
- Oh.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.157
OK, OK, that's good, Maria.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.993
Oh, my gosh.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.830
<i>With three new kids
to care for,</i>

15:54.997 --> 15:57.875
<i>Dan really needed
to start performing at work.</i>

15:58.041 --> 16:01.753
<i>Unfortunately he was having
some issues with a colleague.</i>

16:01.920 --> 16:05.466
OK, Caesar, this is
the one, I can feel it.

16:07.593 --> 16:10.888
Eighty-one seconds? Oh, Caesar.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.223
That's your worst time yet.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.893
You're doing even worse
on your creativity test.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.605
I mean, look at all the imaginative
things I made out of blocks.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.190
Like this awesome plane.

16:26.904 --> 16:30.032
Dan, do you have any results yet?

16:30.199 --> 16:32.826
Oh, well, I've been injecting
the primates twice a day

16:32.993 --> 16:36.788
with the I-13 intelligence drug.
I'm hoping in a week or so...

16:36.955 --> 16:39.958
I hope Caesar is not just
a big waste of time and money.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.754
I'm the one responsible to the board.
Just show me one thing positive.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.341
Look. They still throw their shit.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.718
But now they can keep score.

16:52.429 --> 16:55.057
We have to kick-start this thing.
When can we go to human trials?

16:55.224 --> 16:57.025
We're close, but there's
an intermediate step.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.562
If the I-13 works
on these reality wives...

17:00.729 --> 17:03.774
- You better check that shit.
- Who gonna check me, boo?

17:12.449 --> 17:14.701
We're pinning the future
of our lab on wild beasts.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.703
They're not beasts.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.248
They have feelings, they have families.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.166
Males pee standing up,
females pee sitting down.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.461
These apes are just like you.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.506
And me... you and me, blacks and whites.

17:27.673 --> 17:31.009
More like whites, of course.
We whites are a lighter shade of ape

17:31.176 --> 17:34.012
whereas you are bla... dder infection,
we're all at risk.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.348
So, what were we talking
about again? Vaginas.

17:36.515 --> 17:37.849
- Shut up.
- Yes, of course.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.394
Caesar has got to show some human
intelligence at that board meeting...

17:40.561 --> 17:43.772
Caesar's probably smarter
than half of those board members.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.190
- Dan...
- I know what you're going to say.

17:45.357 --> 17:48.026
"If he's so smart,
why is he in a cage?"

17:48.819 --> 17:49.861
You're in the cage.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.045
What?

18:08.005 --> 18:09.673
- Oh, you're looking for this?
- Uh-huh.

18:09.840 --> 18:10.841
It's my ballerina doll.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.176
- You made this?
- Mama did,

18:13.343 --> 18:17.472
using twigs, moss, spiderwebs,
sparrow bones, lizard eyes,

18:17.639 --> 18:20.601
- all held together with rat droppings.
- Oh, geez.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.528
Ah, ah, ah. What... what are you doing?

19:13.695 --> 19:16.156
I just can't deal with these kids.
They're creepy.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.491
We should just take 'em back.

19:17.658 --> 19:20.952
Maybe you guys just need
to find some common ground.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.439
What about that ballerina doll
Kathy's always playing with?

19:24.289 --> 19:26.124
I don't want to talk about the ballet.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.419
I saw what the ballet did to my mom.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.089
<i>She became obsessed.</i>

19:32.255 --> 19:35.884
<i>She even danced the swan
while she was pregnant with me.</i>

19:39.846 --> 19:42.140
- Boo, ray, boo!
- Shh!

19:42.307 --> 19:45.352
Shh. Hell. You better sit back
before I punch you in your damn throat.

19:45.519 --> 19:46.520
We're trying to enjoy the show.

19:46.687 --> 19:50.440
You go on... shh... shh me again.
I double-dog dare you, hell.

19:50.607 --> 19:52.567
Better ask somebody who I am.

20:03.036 --> 20:04.705
- Whoa!

20:05.539 --> 20:08.083
Got it.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.586
Mom was never the same.

20:13.004 --> 20:16.341
That's unlikely
to ever happen again, ever.

20:16.508 --> 20:19.845
Just give it a shot.
Look what I found earlier.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.471
I mean, I know
it's just a local production.

20:21.638 --> 20:26.226
But could be something for you
and Kathy to talk about, could be fun.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.062
- You really think so?
- Yes.

20:29.229 --> 20:32.524
Well, I suppose I could check it out.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.777
OK. But the minute it becomes
too difficult, I'm giving up.

20:36.570 --> 20:37.696
That's the spirit.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.712
<i>Even though Jody
only returned to the ballet</i>

20:53.879 --> 20:55.464
<i>to connect with the girls,</i>

20:55.630 --> 20:59.468
<i>as she got closer she couldn't help
but get excited at the prospect</i>

20:59.634 --> 21:02.804
<i>of becoming the Swan Queen.</i>

21:02.971 --> 21:05.182
This season we open with "Swan Lake."

21:05.348 --> 21:07.388
As you all know, this piece
has the most challenging

21:07.517 --> 21:11.605
and demanding role in all
of ballet... the Swan Queen.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.315
<i>Sizing up her competition,</i>

21:13.482 --> 21:16.234
<i>Jody knew the battle
would be a tough one.</i>

21:16.401 --> 21:18.361
The white and the black.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.531
Fortunately we have with us
prima ballerina and the lead

21:21.698 --> 21:25.786
in my last 146 productions...
Heather Darcy.

21:28.079 --> 21:30.832
Ah, the seasoned professional.

21:30.999 --> 21:33.418
The still brilliant,
crusty, old, weathered,

21:33.585 --> 21:37.756
leather-faced elder statesman of ballet
to whom these young girls,

21:37.923 --> 21:40.759
less experienced,
more beautiful and delicious,

21:40.926 --> 21:44.721
but still very raw ballerina hopefuls,
look up.

21:44.888 --> 21:48.475
Show these far more desirable children
how it's done, huh?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.645
- Music!

21:57.734 --> 21:59.214
Try that thing where you are skipping

21:59.319 --> 22:01.446
and you hop and you spread
your legs a little bit.

22:04.908 --> 22:07.285
Look at that form,
that technique.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.079
I'll never be that good.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.790
I'm Jody, by the way.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.875
Kendra.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.963
- Are you going to try out?
- Me?

22:18.129 --> 22:21.424
Oh, I don't know.
I mean, I like to dance, but I just...

22:21.591 --> 22:23.301
I don't like to be the
center of attention.

22:24.010 --> 22:26.429
- OK, who's next?
- Oh, food.

22:26.596 --> 22:27.973
- Huh?

22:42.779 --> 22:45.824
It is as if I am seeing ballet
for the first time.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.826
That's not ballet.

22:53.248 --> 22:55.458
The passion, the sensuality.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.879
An ass that makes you want to
crawl inside and take up residence.

23:01.089 --> 23:03.508
I can show passion.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.343
Oh, yeah.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.139
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh.

23:09.306 --> 23:12.225
<i>Jody certainly had
her work cut out for her.</i>

23:12.809 --> 23:15.353
<i>That Kendra chick was smokin'.</i>

23:15.520 --> 23:17.188
Do you accept euros?

23:47.052 --> 23:50.221
Kathy, Lily, Aidan?

24:04.194 --> 24:05.236
- Jody? Ah!

24:05.403 --> 24:06.905
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.199
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm fine.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.617
It was on the floor.

24:10.784 --> 24:14.079
Ah, probably a screw loose.
I'll fix it.

24:16.206 --> 24:17.707
I feel like there's
something in this house.

24:17.874 --> 24:18.875
Like What?

24:19.042 --> 24:22.921
Like I feel hot, clammy,
foul-smelling breath on my neck.

24:24.673 --> 24:28.093
You need call psychic.
Kill bad spirits.

24:28.259 --> 24:31.262
- Ugh.
- No, Maria, enough of this stuff.

24:31.429 --> 24:34.557
OK, then I do blessing,
I protect house.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.729
Honey, you really need to relax.

24:40.563 --> 24:42.440
You're just stressed out
about the children.

24:42.607 --> 24:45.443
No, it's this house. I... I feel it.

24:45.610 --> 24:48.905
And Maria's a little off. I mean,
honestly do you really trust her?

24:49.072 --> 24:52.367
Oh, honey, don't worry,
she couldn't hurt a fly.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.375
Look, you have a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.788
Let's just get you some sleep, OK?

24:58.581 --> 24:59.749
Love you.

25:04.045 --> 25:06.589
I don't believe this...
our whole house ransacked.

25:06.756 --> 25:09.050
You leave the house unattended
with the doors unlocked

25:09.217 --> 25:10.468
and look what happens.

25:10.635 --> 25:13.346
They didn't take anything.
It's just vandalism.

25:13.513 --> 25:15.765
Every room except
the kids' rooms was trashed.

25:15.932 --> 25:16.933
So you suspect the kids?

25:17.100 --> 25:19.394
It was Mama. Mama did it.

25:19.561 --> 25:22.856
She hates this house.
She hates you.

25:25.191 --> 25:28.945
OK, Maria, this is camera.
<i>Necesito</i> filming.

25:29.112 --> 25:30.989
Thank you for helping me
clean up, sweetie.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.950
Oh, hey, been looking
all over for this thing.

25:34.117 --> 25:35.827
- Still got it...

25:35.994 --> 25:38.496
I'm sorry! God, help, honey!

25:38.663 --> 25:42.250
Maria, honey, help! Geez!
Maria, put the camera...

25:42.417 --> 25:45.003
Oh, look at this.

25:45.170 --> 25:47.547
Mom coaching me
when I was a little girl.

25:47.714 --> 25:51.217
- Aw...
- Always applying the guilt trip.

25:51.384 --> 25:53.136
That got me the lead.

25:54.846 --> 25:56.431
Look, Maria.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.975
Maria, look what I found. What is this?

25:59.142 --> 26:03.938
Oh, uh, that's... a new type
of electric toothbrush.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.525
Vibrations knock the tartar
off your teeth.

26:08.359 --> 26:10.820
- Look, a whole box of toothbrushes.
- Whoa.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.156
This black one is huge.

26:13.323 --> 26:15.867
- And look, here's a double-sided one.
- All right.

26:16.034 --> 26:18.078
And one that I can strap on to my face.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.371
Nope. Put that over here.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.333
Uncle Dan, what is this?
Beaded floss?

26:23.500 --> 26:25.585
That's grown-up floss, honey.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.338
Graffiti!

26:28.505 --> 26:30.590
Did you see this?

26:30.757 --> 26:33.927
Who does that?
What are we...? Maria.

26:34.094 --> 26:37.972
- Maria, por favor.

26:38.139 --> 26:41.768
Miss Jody, Miss Jody,
you call this man... Mr. Blaine.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.895
He helped my sister.

26:44.062 --> 26:46.481
- This is a psychic.
- Si, he'll help you.

26:46.648 --> 26:48.441
No, what we really need
are more security cameras.

26:48.608 --> 26:52.654
Uncle Dan. You know, these toothbrushes
look an awful lot like dildos.

27:19.222 --> 27:20.223
Ow!

28:21.075 --> 28:23.036
This is fun, Mama.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.340
You're still awake?

28:36.716 --> 28:37.926
All right, listen, guys, it's just us

28:38.092 --> 28:39.852
until Uncle Dan comes back
from the hospital.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.263
I don't like it,
you don't like it, I don't like it.

28:42.430 --> 28:44.807
Now go to sleep. I have to be up
early for ballet tomorrow.

28:51.022 --> 28:54.400
- You really like ballet, don't you?
- Yeah, but I don't want you to go.

28:54.567 --> 28:55.610
Why?

28:55.777 --> 28:57.862
Mama says you're going
to have an accident.

28:58.029 --> 29:02.200
Oh, OK. Is this the same Mama
who trashed the house?

29:02.367 --> 29:04.327
Basically, yes.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.960
Don't go in there.

29:12.961 --> 29:13.878
I wasn't going to.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.338
Just don't.

29:15.505 --> 29:18.174
It's my house, I can if I want.

29:18.341 --> 29:19.509
I wouldn't.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.344
- Would.
- Wouldn't.

29:21.511 --> 29:23.346
- Would, too.
- Would not.

29:23.513 --> 29:26.516
You know what? I'm the adult.
You're not the boss of me.

29:26.683 --> 29:27.684
Don't.

29:49.414 --> 29:53.584
I told you
not to let anyone in!

30:00.550 --> 30:02.260
<i>And so Jody was...</i>

30:02.427 --> 30:04.887
<i>Oh, my God, I just smelled that.</i>

30:05.054 --> 30:07.015
<i>It just got to me, yeah.</i>

30:07.181 --> 30:08.808
<i>And so Jody was...</i>

30:08.975 --> 30:10.935
<i>Oh, no, I... I'm sorry,
you have to excuse me.</i>

30:11.102 --> 30:12.228
<i>I got to get some fresh air.</i>

30:12.395 --> 30:14.397
<i>The next section
should explain itself.</i>

30:28.953 --> 30:30.705
<i>All right, attention.</i>

30:30.872 --> 30:32.498
I do not wish to repeat myself.

30:32.665 --> 30:35.293
I repeat, I do not wish
to repeat myself.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.587
I require the sweater
I wear as a scarf.

30:40.298 --> 30:43.009
Ah. Comfortable, huh?

30:44.761 --> 30:47.638
Mm... Mother, please, I am working.

30:47.805 --> 30:51.267
All right, because Heather Darcy
is so old, this season

30:51.434 --> 30:53.227
we will have a new Swan Queen,

30:53.394 --> 30:57.106
and that person is Jody Sanders.

31:01.569 --> 31:05.114
Now, Jody, show us your routine.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.992
No, I'm the Swan Queen.

31:08.951 --> 31:11.746
- Watch me. Ah...!

31:11.913 --> 31:14.665
As I was saying, my choice for new...

31:14.832 --> 31:16.959
Her?! Anyone but her!

31:17.126 --> 31:20.671
You might just as well
have picked the janitor!

31:20.838 --> 31:23.549
- Me?

31:31.015 --> 31:33.643
- Ira, please, not now. OK.
- What?

31:33.810 --> 31:35.812
Yes, it was a difficult decision,

31:35.978 --> 31:38.773
but I have always been
attracted to Jody.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.900
How could I not? She has
the body of a fifth-grade boy.

31:41.067 --> 31:43.986
But in the event that she
is unable to dance,

31:44.153 --> 31:48.157
I am naming as her
understudy Kendra Brooks.

31:52.495 --> 31:54.622
All right, that's lunch.

32:09.011 --> 32:11.889
Ooh, this is a nice house.
I'm gonna go find the girls.

32:14.016 --> 32:17.016
Kathy, how did you know I was going to
have an accident today at the ballet?

32:17.145 --> 32:18.271
Mama told me.

32:18.438 --> 32:21.774
OK, well, how did Mama know
I was going to have an accident?

32:25.528 --> 32:28.698
Oh, there you are.
I found this bandage on my head.

32:28.865 --> 32:31.826
Dan, please. I think there is something
going on in this house,

32:31.993 --> 32:33.286
something about this Mama.

32:33.453 --> 32:35.294
I'm gonna call the psychic
Maria told us about.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.091
Jody, do you really
think we need a psychic?

32:37.165 --> 32:38.325
Uncle Dan, come here.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.168
- Coming.
- I want to show you something.

32:41.669 --> 32:45.506
Uncle Dan, Mama taught me some tricks.
Look what I can do.

32:46.757 --> 32:49.051
- Oh, wow, that's really good, honey.
- Dada.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.846
Good Lord.

32:52.013 --> 32:55.224
- Uncle Dan, look at me.
- Evil spirits.

32:55.391 --> 32:56.726
Look, Mr. Dan, look.

32:56.893 --> 32:59.645
Isn't that one of Jody's bathing suits?

32:59.812 --> 33:02.857
You're facing something our
human minds cannot imagine.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.526
- Mama.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.446
Let's get you in a robe.

33:09.739 --> 33:11.419
Do you want to hear
about the ballet today?

33:12.241 --> 33:15.745
- Mama's helping us get ready.
- Oh, OK, I'll brush, too.

33:18.956 --> 33:21.501
Hm. Where did my toothbrush go?

33:27.924 --> 33:30.384
Hey, we don't lick our balls
in this house.

33:30.551 --> 33:32.929
Sorry, won't happen again.

33:34.514 --> 33:35.973
<i>Try as she might,</i>

33:36.140 --> 33:39.268
<i>Jody just couldn't seem
to connect with those kids.</i>

33:39.435 --> 33:42.063
<i>Or get the taste of that
toothbrush out of her mouth.</i>

33:42.230 --> 33:44.857
<i>Was it just eight-year-old teen angst,</i>

33:45.024 --> 33:48.402
<i>or were there otherworldly
forces at work here?</i>

35:02.852 --> 35:04.186
- Baby?
- Hm?

35:04.353 --> 35:05.674
- Babe, I heard something.
- What?

35:05.688 --> 35:06.731
I think there's someone in the kitchen.

35:06.897 --> 35:09.609
See? There's nobody down here.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.861
There it is again!
Right there. Go look.

35:12.028 --> 35:16.115
Jody, calm down. See, there's nothing
to worry about. It's just...

35:16.282 --> 35:18.159
- Oh, God! Geez!

35:20.870 --> 35:22.496
Dan, I'm calling the psychic!

35:22.663 --> 35:24.183
- Ah! Make the call!

35:25.708 --> 35:27.543
Blaine Fulda, professional psychic.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.045
Hi, I'm Jody.

35:29.211 --> 35:31.589
- Indeed you are.
- Yes. And this is my husband Dan.

35:31.756 --> 35:34.592
Your payment as requested.
$500 in unmarked bills.

35:34.759 --> 35:36.552
- And of course, you know Maria.

35:36.719 --> 35:39.221
- Hola, Mr. Blaine.
- Hi, Maria. How's your sister?

35:39.388 --> 35:41.599
Dead. Demon kill her.

35:41.766 --> 35:43.607
Well, that explains
the unreturned phone calls.

35:43.726 --> 35:46.228
I'm sensing evil.

35:46.395 --> 35:49.315
I'm gonna have to get some of
your personal belongings here,

35:49.482 --> 35:52.109
just so I can check for
demon and ghost residue.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.486
I'm not gonna be able
to lift all those monitors,

35:53.653 --> 35:56.822
but I'll send my cousin tomorrow with
the white van. He can get them in there.

35:56.989 --> 35:58.783
Dan was attacked
by the kitchen last night.

35:58.949 --> 36:01.410
- We think it might be Mama.
- Kitchen attack?

36:01.577 --> 36:03.079
You could've said that earlier.

36:03.245 --> 36:05.998
If a room turns on you,
it's either a ghost or a demon.

36:06.165 --> 36:10.586
Can a demon take over someone?
Like, live within them?

36:10.753 --> 36:12.171
Damn, that's some scary shit.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.465
So a demon is about
the worst thing you can have?

36:14.632 --> 36:17.343
No, ma'am, an STD is the
worst thing that you can have.

36:17.510 --> 36:21.013
Who do you know who wants to hurt you?
Do you have a jealous colleague at work?

36:21.180 --> 36:23.099
A Facebook friend
you might have ignored?

36:23.265 --> 36:26.352
Maybe you adopted a small
African child named Ikatababwe,

36:26.519 --> 36:28.562
promising to feed
this nigga for 25 cents a day.

36:28.771 --> 36:30.251
But then he needs something to drink!

36:31.190 --> 36:33.526
Anyway, let's begin.

36:33.693 --> 36:36.028
This is the evil communicator.

36:36.195 --> 36:39.115
When I put this on, I'll be able
to cross over to the other side

36:39.281 --> 36:41.617
and confront the entity.
That will immediately trigger

36:41.784 --> 36:46.372
the final $350 payment of
child support to Tisha Fulda.

36:46.539 --> 36:49.792
And if you guys would just join hands,
close eyes and concentrate.

36:49.959 --> 36:53.170
Empty your mind of all
the thoughts of today's troubles.

36:54.380 --> 36:56.799
Everything that went on,
get that out of your mind.

36:56.966 --> 36:59.135
This is all about the spirit world here.

36:59.301 --> 37:03.556
And three, two and one.

37:09.645 --> 37:12.148
What's happening? Things are starting
to move all by itself!

37:14.066 --> 37:15.693
Breathe! Breathe!

37:15.860 --> 37:17.653
- Wait, I don't think he can breathe!
- He's a pro!

37:17.820 --> 37:20.656
A sophisticated piece of equipment
like that? Of course he can breathe.

37:20.823 --> 37:23.159
Shit, I couldn't breathe.

37:23.325 --> 37:26.036
Almost killed myself.
All right, I communicated.

37:26.203 --> 37:28.581
- It was definitely a demon.
- Oh, my God.

37:29.874 --> 37:32.376
Wait a minute. I was wrong.
It's a ghost.

37:32.543 --> 37:34.003
So strong.

37:34.795 --> 37:35.921
- Ow!

37:36.756 --> 37:38.036
- Help, it's got me!
- Dan!

37:38.132 --> 37:39.550
- Dan, wake up!
- Ma'am, you got to

37:39.717 --> 37:43.095
get out of here. It's evil!
It's pure evil! It's Mama!

38:03.741 --> 38:05.501
Now do you believe
that something's going on?

38:05.618 --> 38:07.912
He got dragged away,
yelling out, "Mama."

38:08.078 --> 38:10.080
He got dragged away?
I don't remember that.

38:10.247 --> 38:13.501
- Dan, you were unconscious.
- I don't remember that, either.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.211
Look, honey, I don't want to argue.

38:15.377 --> 38:17.338
The important thing is,
we love each other, OK?

38:17.505 --> 38:19.905
No, the important thing is that
this Mama thing could be real

38:20.049 --> 38:21.634
and she might be trying to kill us.

38:21.801 --> 38:24.762
Jod, that guy was a fraud
and that's it. OK?

38:34.730 --> 38:36.899
- What's that?
- My penis.

38:37.066 --> 38:38.692
- No.
- Yes.

38:40.277 --> 38:43.489
- There, right now, there.
- I know. I'm trying.

38:43.656 --> 38:46.867
- What the hell is that?
- My penis?

38:47.827 --> 38:50.204
- What's making that sound?

39:55.144 --> 39:57.479
Dan, what is that?

39:59.315 --> 40:00.816
My penis.

40:34.975 --> 40:37.937
Is that smoke?

40:41.982 --> 40:45.861
Maria! What are you doing?!
You're gonna burn down the house!

40:46.028 --> 40:48.197
Kill bad spirits!

40:48.364 --> 40:51.825
- What is going on?
- Maria almost burned the house down.

40:51.992 --> 40:53.272
- What?
- That's it, she's got...

40:54.370 --> 40:58.916
Enough! This is getting out of hand.
You're scaring everybody.

40:59.083 --> 41:01.126
You can't fire her. I mean,
she's been with us for years.

41:01.293 --> 41:02.586
I don't know what to do.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.838
- That's discrimination.
- OK, now what the hell?

41:05.005 --> 41:08.342
- This is completely insane!
- It's what she believes in, honey!

41:08.509 --> 41:09.635
Give me that!

41:09.802 --> 41:12.638
You're gonna let me go?!
Your family is not safe!

41:12.805 --> 41:14.932
I'm sorry, Maria,
it's just not working out.

41:15.099 --> 41:17.810
I'll give you a recommendation,
just nothing involving kids

41:17.977 --> 41:20.729
- or within a mile of anyone's house.

41:22.147 --> 41:25.859
I can't do this anymore.
I got to go to work.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.706
I don't even understand
what you're saying!

42:01.979 --> 42:03.897
Ow!

42:04.064 --> 42:05.691
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

42:05.858 --> 42:08.610
for the past two years,
our own Dan Sanders has been

42:08.777 --> 42:11.447
testing the I-13 compound on 30 apes.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.866
Unfortunately, 29 of them turned into

42:14.033 --> 42:16.618
insane, aggressive,
deviant sexual predators.

42:16.785 --> 42:18.787
But one, Caesar,

42:18.954 --> 42:22.041
has experienced a huge leap
in intelligence.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.376
Here he plays three opponents.

42:24.543 --> 42:25.919
Of course, they're apes.

42:26.086 --> 42:30.883
But Caesar's superior capabilities
are the work of one man.

42:31.050 --> 42:34.553
The brains behind
the I-13 project, Dan San...

42:34.720 --> 42:36.055
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine, Martin.

42:36.221 --> 42:39.641
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'd like to introduce you to Caesar...

42:39.808 --> 42:41.088
You're not getting away from me!

42:41.185 --> 42:43.020
- Oof!

42:47.357 --> 42:49.568
- Oh, no!

43:08.337 --> 43:10.506
<i>Traffic is backed up
on the Broad Street Bridge,</i>

43:10.672 --> 43:14.134
<i>where apparently police are battling
dozens of apes in a running gunfight.</i>

43:14.301 --> 43:17.346
<i>Our reports indicate that
a scientist at a research laboratory</i>

43:17.513 --> 43:20.432
<i>gave these apes an experimental
intelligence drug.</i>

43:20.599 --> 43:24.103
<i>I'm being told that all available
officers are now on the scene.</i>

43:24.269 --> 43:29.399
<i>But at this time, we are advising all
our viewers to find alternate routes.</i>

43:29.566 --> 43:32.361
<i>I'm now being told
we have the actual 911 call</i>

43:32.528 --> 43:34.696
<i>that first alerted the police
to the situation.</i>

43:34.863 --> 43:37.116
<i>- 911, what's your emergency?</i>

43:37.282 --> 43:39.868
<i>Oh, my God!
Apes are inside the house!</i>

43:40.035 --> 43:42.204
<i>Calm down, ma'am. What happened?</i>

43:42.371 --> 43:44.289
<i>We were making love and...
Oh, my God!</i>

43:44.456 --> 43:46.375
<i>- They're attacking him!</i>
<i>- Who are they attacking, ma'am?</i>

43:46.542 --> 43:50.212
<i>Carl! Oh, my God!
Please, help him!</i>

43:50.379 --> 43:52.699
<i>- Where is your husband right now?</i>
<i>- Carl's not my husband.</i>

43:52.714 --> 43:56.385
<i>My husband's the anchor for
Channel 12 News. He can't know about it.</i>

43:56.552 --> 43:58.137
<i>- OK, ma'am, but we need to...</i>
<i>- Hurry!</i>

43:58.303 --> 44:00.264
<i>Send help while my husband's
still on the air!</i>

44:00.430 --> 44:02.850
<i>Ma'am, that's not important.
Your life is.</i>

44:03.016 --> 44:05.060
<i>Yeah, you're right.
Why should he care?</i>

44:05.227 --> 44:08.480
<i>I mean, I'm pretty sure he's been
sleeping with his co-anchor, that bitch!</i>

44:08.647 --> 44:09.857
<i>Oh, I'm gonna rip her...</i>

44:14.444 --> 44:16.405
<i>Congratulations, girl.</i>

44:16.572 --> 44:19.992
I knew it was gonna be you.
You're just so perfect, so mechanical.

44:20.159 --> 44:22.703
Watching you dance
is like watching a robot.

44:22.870 --> 44:24.079
Thanks.

44:26.331 --> 44:27.916
So hungry.

44:30.502 --> 44:31.503
Mm.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.047
- Is that all?
- Pierre has a weight limit.

44:34.214 --> 44:37.009
I'm too heavy. Look at Mara.

44:37.176 --> 44:39.511
She looks great.

44:41.096 --> 44:42.264
Look, are you sure you're OK?

44:43.348 --> 44:44.949
Weird things have been
happening at home.

44:45.017 --> 44:47.186
Kathy said there was
going to be an accident.

44:47.352 --> 44:51.273
- Then it happened to Heather.
- That's some serious shit.

44:51.440 --> 44:53.650
You should talk to those kids.

44:53.817 --> 44:55.360
Whoa, pizza.

44:58.614 --> 45:03.535
I eat and eat and eat,
and I don't gain a pound.

45:28.936 --> 45:30.604
Heather!

45:31.980 --> 45:33.482
You think you can replace me?

45:33.649 --> 45:38.237
Well, we'll see how you like it
once the swan consumes you!

45:48.830 --> 45:50.749
Damn it!

45:51.333 --> 45:52.668
Door!

45:53.961 --> 45:55.837
Son of a bitch!

45:58.548 --> 46:01.593
Oh, I didn't know
you were such a good builder.

46:02.928 --> 46:04.346
Wow.

46:05.472 --> 46:08.558
Kathy, I want you
to tell me about Mama.

46:08.725 --> 46:11.728
Mama doesn't like it
when you talk about her.

46:11.895 --> 46:12.938
Who is Mama?

46:13.105 --> 46:15.357
She was a woman who
read from an evil book.

46:15.524 --> 46:18.819
Sometimes she comes to us in a dream.

46:18.986 --> 46:20.946
- In a dream?

46:21.113 --> 46:23.282
In your dreams, of course.

46:23.448 --> 46:25.284
I wish I could see
what's inside your dreams.

46:26.994 --> 46:30.163
To extract what's in your dreams.
To perform an inception.

46:31.540 --> 46:33.875
Will you drop that?
That's my birth tuba.

46:37.004 --> 46:41.008
Hello. I'm Dom Kolb.
You called about a dream extraction?

46:41.174 --> 46:43.552
Yes. I need to find
out about an evil book.

46:43.719 --> 46:44.886
Mm-hm.

46:45.095 --> 46:47.764
This machine will allow us
access to the dream world.

46:47.931 --> 46:49.224
Let's begin.

46:53.562 --> 46:55.147
So when do we start dreaming?

46:55.314 --> 46:57.941
You never really remember
the beginning of a dream,

46:58.108 --> 46:59.318
- do you?
- I guess.

46:59.526 --> 47:01.445
- OK, then,

47:01.611 --> 47:05.282
this is your first lesson
in shared dreaming. Stay calm.

47:05.449 --> 47:08.118
Sorry. I dropped my phone in there.

47:09.244 --> 47:12.581
You need to clear your subconscious.
And watch what you think about.

47:12.748 --> 47:15.000
- Nothing crazy.
- Right.

47:15.167 --> 47:17.878
Like having your crotch
burst into flames.

47:27.971 --> 47:31.183
What does that
have to do with Ma...?

47:31.350 --> 47:33.935
- Hey!
- Oh.

47:34.811 --> 47:38.231
- Let's start over.

47:43.153 --> 47:45.113
I'm Jody Sanders.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.366
Yes, my dear. I've been expecting you.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.368
Please, come in.

47:49.534 --> 47:51.161
They call me Christian Grey.

47:55.332 --> 47:57.209
How do you like my blue room?

47:57.376 --> 48:00.295
- It's red.
- Oh. I'm color-blind.

48:00.462 --> 48:02.714
My decorator assured me that...
Never mind.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.219
- Champagne?
- Mm.

48:14.518 --> 48:15.977
Have a seat.

48:20.273 --> 48:21.274
I'll stand.

48:21.441 --> 48:24.820
Hey, Christian, man, golly, man!
I'd like to thank you a lot, man,

48:24.986 --> 48:27.322
for working on my prostrate
like it was a speed bag.

48:27.489 --> 48:30.450
Yes, Michael, I must admit, I was
surprised at your performance, as well.

48:30.617 --> 48:33.912
Not bad for a washed-up, overweight,
facially tattooed...

48:35.664 --> 48:36.706
Do it again.

48:39.334 --> 48:40.836
Oh...!

48:46.007 --> 48:48.552
I have no idea what that one was.

48:49.344 --> 48:51.304
Me neither.

48:53.181 --> 48:55.308
Mama, are you here?

48:55.475 --> 48:59.062
- Dom, is that you?
- Oh, shit.

48:59.229 --> 49:02.524
You said you'd had a dream
that we'd grow old together.

49:02.691 --> 49:04.401
Right. And We Will.

49:04.568 --> 49:07.612
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

49:07.779 --> 49:09.899
How could you bring her here?
What about our children?

49:09.990 --> 49:13.535
- They're not real.
- Yes, they are. Watch.

49:13.702 --> 49:15.745
James, Phillippa!

49:17.581 --> 49:18.415
Ew.

49:24.379 --> 49:26.965
You're not gonna jump, are you?

49:27.132 --> 49:29.843
I hadn't thought about that.
Thank you.

49:32.888 --> 49:33.930
OK, we're not getting anywhere.

49:34.097 --> 49:35.557
What does any of this
have to do with Kathy?

49:35.724 --> 49:37.517
Kathy? I thought you were Kathy.

49:40.896 --> 49:42.063
Oh.

49:55.827 --> 50:00.916
"Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

50:18.558 --> 50:20.769
What's happening to me?!

50:22.521 --> 50:25.607
- That must have been her.
- Mama.

50:26.733 --> 50:28.485
She wants to take us home to the cliff.

50:29.945 --> 50:31.780
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

50:32.906 --> 50:34.906
But I trust you'll give me
a favorable Yelp review?

50:42.040 --> 50:43.480
<i>Jody's mission was clear.</i>

50:43.625 --> 50:45.544
<i>The evil book that created Mama</i>

50:45.710 --> 50:49.256
<i>was located in the cellar
of a cabin, in the woods.</i>

50:49.422 --> 50:53.552
<i>If she could find that cabin,
maybe she could find some answers.</i>

50:53.718 --> 50:56.805
If we can find that cabin,
maybe we can find some answers.

50:56.972 --> 50:58.848
<i>OK, calm down. I'm gonna come over.</i>

51:00.559 --> 51:01.851
- Kendra?
<i>- What?</i>

51:03.728 --> 51:05.647
<i>OK, wait, what's going on now?</i>

51:05.814 --> 51:08.149
I think she's out there!

51:09.651 --> 51:11.736
OK, OK, just... you stay calm!

51:11.903 --> 51:13.143
<i>Front door open.</i>

51:13.154 --> 51:15.282
- She's in the house!
<i>- Front door open.</i>

51:15.448 --> 51:17.576
- OK, stay...
<i>- Front door open.</i>

51:17.742 --> 51:19.160
Shut the hell up!

51:19.327 --> 51:20.954
<i>No need for that, bitch.</i>

51:21.121 --> 51:23.081
- Bitch?!
<i>- Front door open.</i>

51:23.164 --> 51:25.524
- No, you did not just call me a bitch!
<i>- Front door open...</i>

51:28.628 --> 51:30.046
- Honey?
- Dan?!

51:30.213 --> 51:34.175
I am so sorry. I didn't know
who you were and...

51:34.342 --> 51:38.054
It's OK, honey, it was an accident.
Right, Caesar?

51:38.221 --> 51:40.974
- And of course he can stay here.

51:44.144 --> 51:46.354
Look at that. Caesar wants to help out
around the house.

51:46.521 --> 51:47.522
Aw.

51:48.106 --> 51:50.400
Hey...

51:56.364 --> 51:58.700
I'm sorry, I see an ape,
I come out swinging.

51:58.867 --> 52:01.953
- That's understandable.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.622
Here you go.

52:03.788 --> 52:06.750
I am so glad you're OK,
but tonight was a wake-up call.

52:06.916 --> 52:10.712
- I think we've got to find that cabin.
- OK. I got an idea.

52:10.879 --> 52:14.299
Wait, we fired Maria.
Who's gonna watch the kids?

52:14.466 --> 52:16.968
- I already took care of it.

52:18.303 --> 52:21.014
- Naughty Nanny's here.
- Nice to meet you, Naughty.

52:21.181 --> 52:24.225
- This is my wife Jody.
- Threesome? That costs extra.

52:25.310 --> 52:28.021
Oh, Jesus. Monkey, too?

52:28.188 --> 52:32.108
Oh, you people are freaks,
but for an extra $100.

52:32.275 --> 52:33.652
What agency did you call?

52:33.818 --> 52:36.363
Oh, they have nurses
and cheerleaders and nannies.

52:36.529 --> 52:38.782
Dan, you called an escort service.

52:38.948 --> 52:41.660
I used the same agency
to book a Santa for Christmas.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.495
Someone called for Santa?

52:44.621 --> 52:46.956
Ho, ho, ho.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.044
Dan, you're watching the kids.

52:56.591 --> 53:00.929
<i>Jody was nervous
about what she might find at the cabin,</i>

53:01.096 --> 53:02.681
<i>but she was comforted by the fact</i>

53:02.847 --> 53:06.267
<i>that Caesar and the girls
were in good hands.</i>

53:35.130 --> 53:37.507
Who do you work for?

53:38.842 --> 53:40.762
Kendra, this isn't
the cabin I was talking about.

53:40.927 --> 53:43.930
I know, I just
thought you needed to relax.

53:44.097 --> 53:45.140
Take one of these.

53:45.974 --> 53:48.601
Um, I don't know.

53:48.768 --> 53:51.563
Oh, come on, they'll only last
a couple of hours, tops.

53:51.730 --> 53:54.899
Kendra, I don't need drugs to have fun.

53:59.237 --> 54:00.397
Let me take a picture.

54:00.488 --> 54:01.656
Oh, that's so hot!

54:01.823 --> 54:03.491
Yeah!

54:05.160 --> 54:07.704
Yeah, ride it, yeah, yeah!

54:22.093 --> 54:24.763
A dollar will make me holler,
honey boo boo child.

55:09.974 --> 55:12.143
- Sorry.

55:25.657 --> 55:27.659
I don't always go downtown,

55:27.826 --> 55:31.746
but when I do,
I drink a beer first.

55:31.913 --> 55:35.667
I'm the king of the world!
Woo! Woo!

55:36.459 --> 55:39.003
I'm wicked hard!

55:42.674 --> 55:43.800
Mind if I play through?

55:44.384 --> 55:45.677
- Ooh, shit!

55:45.844 --> 55:48.930
Again? You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill you!

56:26.426 --> 56:29.929
Oh, my God,
rehearsal. I'm late.

56:30.305 --> 56:34.767
Oh, no, oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

56:50.491 --> 56:53.828
- Stop, stop!
- Oh, Jody, thank God you're here, girl.

56:53.995 --> 56:55.413
I was just dancing and kissing him

56:55.580 --> 56:56.998
'cause I didn't want him
to think about you being late.

56:57.165 --> 56:59.406
Well, I'm the dancer, so I'll do
the kissing around here.

56:59.542 --> 57:01.210
That was amazing.

57:04.213 --> 57:05.453
I want you to have my children.

57:05.590 --> 57:07.967
But, Papa, please,
we want to stay with you.

57:08.134 --> 57:10.386
- Back in the car, Gaston.
- Aw...

57:10.553 --> 57:12.221
She can't make you forget about me.

57:12.388 --> 57:14.474
I overslept because you
just took off this morning.

57:14.641 --> 57:16.184
- This morning?
- Yeah, you slept over.

57:16.351 --> 57:19.062
What? Wait a minute, did you have
some kind of lezzo dream fantasy

57:19.228 --> 57:21.230
- about me?
- Don't act like you weren't there.

57:21.397 --> 57:24.233
We had something special.
We made love last night for hours.

57:24.400 --> 57:26.152
- What?
- Oh, and now you're gonna tell me

57:26.319 --> 57:27.920
Tiger Woods didn't
come out of my vagina?

57:30.406 --> 57:33.451
- Jody.

57:33.618 --> 57:35.495
What?!

57:35.662 --> 57:37.789
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah.</i>

57:37.956 --> 57:40.166
Well, that explains the poison ivy.

57:40.333 --> 57:41.709
Jody?

57:42.835 --> 57:45.046
- There you are.
- Kendra?

57:45.213 --> 57:46.839
Oh, the door was open
so I let myself in.

57:47.006 --> 57:49.676
It's OK. Look, I'm so sorry.

57:49.842 --> 57:52.345
I really believed something happened
between us last night.

57:52.512 --> 57:55.682
- I must have dreamt the whole thing.
- Oh, no, we had sex.

57:55.848 --> 57:57.488
But this morning at rehearsal,
you said...

57:57.517 --> 57:59.397
I can't have the whole cast
knowing my business.

57:59.519 --> 58:01.020
I'm already doing half of 'em,

58:01.187 --> 58:03.022
and besides, me and Pierre...
we have this little thing...

58:03.189 --> 58:04.399
Wait, then, what's this?

58:05.900 --> 58:07.620
Beats me... must have
happened after I left.

58:07.735 --> 58:11.030
<i>- Oh, yeah!</i>
- Girl, you are freaky.

58:12.865 --> 58:14.617
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

58:14.784 --> 58:16.953
<i>Oh, yeah, get it. Oh, my God.</i>

58:19.414 --> 58:21.207
- Oh, shit!

58:21.374 --> 58:24.210
- See, I knew she was real.

58:26.462 --> 58:28.542
All right, let's find out
where this cabin is.

58:29.841 --> 58:31.634
- Ugh!

58:46.190 --> 58:48.693
What in the hell?

58:48.860 --> 58:50.987
- Bad girl.

58:52.488 --> 58:53.489
Oh, what is this?

58:53.656 --> 58:57.201
Oh, my God, it's the same
cabin from the dream. Of course.

58:58.745 --> 59:00.546
So, what are we gonna do
if we find that book?

59:00.663 --> 59:03.332
I don't know, if that's the book
that turned Mama into what she is,

59:03.499 --> 59:06.044
maybe it could
somehow reverse the curse.

59:06.210 --> 59:07.670
OK, we're almost there.

59:09.005 --> 59:12.175
- Hey, I'm not going in there.
- We have to go inside.

59:12.341 --> 59:15.553
The book is the key
to the nightmare I'm living.

59:15.720 --> 59:19.265
- Oh, my gosh, who are you?
- I'm Jody and this is Kendra.

59:19.432 --> 59:21.184
We're looking for something
very important.

59:21.350 --> 59:23.603
We all are. Come on in.

59:28.858 --> 59:32.070
<i>♪ Go tell it on the mountain</i>

59:32.236 --> 59:36.407
<i>♪ Over the hills and everywhere
Go...</i>

59:36.574 --> 59:39.077
Everybody, this is Jody and Kendra.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.995
- Hello, Jody and Kendra.
- Hi.

59:41.162 --> 59:42.413
Pardon me for not standing,

59:42.580 --> 59:45.140
but I'm mending the wing of this bird
that we found in the woods.

59:45.249 --> 59:47.960
OK. Hi, we're in a hurry.

59:48.127 --> 59:49.879
We're actually looking for
a book that could save lives.

59:50.046 --> 59:52.381
- Yes, I've got it right here.
- Oh, thank God.

59:52.548 --> 59:56.719
Thank him indeed. The Bible.
Here, let me read to you.

59:56.886 --> 59:59.597
Oh, no, no, see,
we're actually looking for...

59:59.764 --> 01:00:03.601
- ...the book of evil.
- I know evil all too well.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:05.645
- You do?
- This weekend's devoted to Mia.

01:00:05.812 --> 01:00:07.063
It's a detox weekend.

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:10.733
She's hooked on energy shots.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.485
Oh, yeah, that's a real struggle.

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.320
OK, listen,
we're looking for another book

01:00:14.487 --> 01:00:17.156
- somewhere in this cabin.
- Hm. We haven't seen anything.

01:00:17.323 --> 01:00:18.991
We gave it a shot,
let's get out of here.

01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:20.993
OK, wait.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:24.247
- Is there a cellar?
- - Great.

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:31.087
- There it is.
- Oh!

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:49.021
OK, I don't care what it says.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:52.275
"The curse begins with four words.

01:00:52.441 --> 01:00:55.820
Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

01:01:07.623 --> 01:01:09.343
You're all going to die tonight.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:14.177
You're all going to die tonight.

01:01:28.436 --> 01:01:30.062
"The curse ends with one word."

01:01:30.229 --> 01:01:31.856
"Adunda."

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:35.818
What the heck?

01:01:35.985 --> 01:01:39.447
- Why?
- I don't have an arm.

01:01:40.823 --> 01:01:43.409
For some reason
I cut my tongue in half.

01:01:43.576 --> 01:01:46.996
OK, well, let's at least finish
the song. Everyone hold hands.

01:01:47.163 --> 01:01:50.416
- Except for Eric.
- Damn.

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:54.629
<i>♪ Go tell it on the mountain</i>

01:01:54.795 --> 01:01:58.966
<i>♪ Over the hills and everywhere</i>

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:01.594
Well, maybe we didn't do it right.

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:04.513
"Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

01:02:17.276 --> 01:02:19.320
"Adunda."

01:02:19.487 --> 01:02:22.114
Why does this keep happening?
Where's my arm?

01:02:22.281 --> 01:02:24.742
- Is this yours?
- That's a left.

01:02:24.909 --> 01:02:26.452
That's mine.
Could you hand it to me, please?

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:29.121
- I need a right.
- Eric chainsawed it off.

01:02:29.288 --> 01:02:31.540
- Look, I'm sorry.
- My... My leg?

01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:34.085
No, that's black. It's not mine.

01:02:34.252 --> 01:02:36.837
- Oh, shit.
- I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:02:37.004 --> 01:02:39.840
- Oh, cry me a river.

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.327
I'm gonna need a little help.
I have to go to the bathroom.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:46.973
- My penis is in the corner.
- This is fucked up.

01:02:47.139 --> 01:02:48.641
Let me try.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:55.314
"Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto."

01:02:58.192 --> 01:02:59.193
Nothing again.

01:03:02.655 --> 01:03:04.282
- You know what? Let's go.
- Wait, there's a door right here.

01:03:04.448 --> 01:03:05.741
Let's go out this way.

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:08.369
OK, cool, we can avoid
the weirdos upstairs.

01:03:08.536 --> 01:03:11.998
<i>♪ We're gonna get you</i>

01:03:12.164 --> 01:03:14.959
<i>♪ Not another peep</i>

01:03:17.003 --> 01:03:22.925
Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto.
Gort Klaatu Barada Nikto.

01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:25.636
<i>Kendra and I recited
the Latin words over and over</i>

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.888
at the cabin and on the way home.

01:03:28.055 --> 01:03:30.850
We must have said it a hundred times,
but nothing happened.

01:03:31.017 --> 01:03:32.297
What if it isn't the right book?

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:34.687
Maybe the curse
has somehow been lifted.

01:03:36.689 --> 01:03:40.026
<i>Luckily for Dan and Jody,
there was someone in the house</i>

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:42.528
<i>who, thanks to the I-13 formula,</i>

01:03:42.695 --> 01:03:46.490
<i>had increased intelligence
and superior cognitive ability.</i>

01:03:46.657 --> 01:03:49.201
<i>His analytical problem-solving skills
allowed him...</i>

01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:52.163
<i>- ...to ascertain crucial information.</i>

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:57.293
<i>A marvel of modern-da y science,
his IQ had surpassed even the most...</i>

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.711
<i>Aw, hell.</i>

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.577
Why did I think
you could be intelligent?

01:04:31.744 --> 01:04:33.746
You're nothing but a dumb animal.

01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:35.289
Ow!

01:04:35.456 --> 01:04:37.249
Idiot!

01:04:39.668 --> 01:04:41.921
- I can talk.
- Hey, Caesar.

01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:46.592
Steve?

01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:48.427
Dan's got a mad demon in his house.

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:52.306
- Matt Damon's in his house?
- No, a mad demon.

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:56.560
I love Matt Damon. Jason Bourne.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:57.937
Oy.

01:05:00.606 --> 01:05:03.734
I should have known not to bring
a wild animal into the house.

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:05.528
I'm... I'm so sorry.

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:07.774
But I believed in Caesar.
I thought he was different.

01:05:07.863 --> 01:05:09.103
There's something more to this.

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:12.535
- I can feel it.
- No, he just... went crazy.

01:05:12.701 --> 01:05:16.038
Forget it. But I still think Mama
could be in this house.

01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:17.957
- But don't you...
- We just had a whole night go on

01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:21.877
- without a single sign of anything.
- I guess.

01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:24.797
I was just so scared
last night for the kids.

01:05:24.964 --> 01:05:26.424
You're coming around.

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:31.429
<i>Am I getting attached to them?</i>

01:06:12.678 --> 01:06:14.430
It's the cliff from the dream.

01:06:15.139 --> 01:06:17.933
Get in the car now.
Don't make me yell!

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:20.686
Unto thee, Satan,
I sacrifice these children.

01:06:20.853 --> 01:06:23.272
Return home to the cliff of...
Holy shit!

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:27.776
Home is at the cliff.
Oh, my God. Girls!

01:06:28.652 --> 01:06:32.156
Kathy. It's OK. I saw the cliff.
I know what "home" means.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:45.127
- Whoa!

01:06:47.129 --> 01:06:48.547
Come on, girls. Let's go get Aidan.

01:06:48.714 --> 01:06:50.549
That's cool.

01:06:50.716 --> 01:06:53.093
Lily! Come on.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:56.847
Aidan! Are you OK?

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:07.525
Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan!

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:09.151
Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:10.444
- She's here!

01:07:10.611 --> 01:07:13.531
Whoa. Girls, girls, girls.
One at a time. Lily, you first.

01:07:16.784 --> 01:07:18.077
Got it. Now Kathy.

01:07:18.244 --> 01:07:20.663
Mama! Mama! She's here!
She's gonna kill us!

01:07:20.829 --> 01:07:23.550
How many times do I have to tell
everyone there's no such thing as...

01:07:49.191 --> 01:07:50.401
Ow!

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:11.714
Maria? What are you doing here?

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.717
I was angry you fire me,
so I bake you this.

01:08:16.093 --> 01:08:19.179
- A shit pie?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.433
- Uh, thanks, but...
- Hot dog?

01:08:24.184 --> 01:08:27.313
No, that's still shit with mustard.

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:31.734
Maybe just a banana, then?
Very much potassium.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:34.444
So bueno, Mr. Dan.

01:08:34.612 --> 01:08:36.863
No, I... I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you...

01:08:37.031 --> 01:08:41.452
Mr. Dan, we have our problems,
but I always love you.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:43.037
So much.

01:08:48.584 --> 01:08:51.377
When I see you, I see my father.

01:08:53.881 --> 01:08:55.256
Dan. Dan, we have to...

01:08:56.341 --> 01:08:59.386
- Wait. What's going on here?
- I can explain.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.782
There's no time. Mama has the girls.
I know where she took them.

01:09:03.557 --> 01:09:05.267
Got to go.

01:09:05.434 --> 01:09:06.935
You remind me of my father.

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:08.854
Dan!

01:09:11.774 --> 01:09:13.651
<i>Knowing the girls
were in danger,</i>

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:17.029
<i>Dan and Jody sped off,
racing to get to the cliff they...</i>

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.406
<i>Oh, my God. What happened to the car?</i>

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:20.991
<i>Where...? Oh, there it is.</i>

01:09:21.158 --> 01:09:25.453
<i>They were no longer able to sit idly by
and let a ghost jump off a cliff,</i>

01:09:25.621 --> 01:09:27.206
<i>- sacrificing their children with her.</i>
- Kathy! Lily!

01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:30.042
Oh, my God. There they are.
Kathy, Lily, stop!

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.005
- What do we do now?
- Um, I'll just...

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.013
...read from this
and change her back to human.

01:09:45.724 --> 01:09:48.143
Girls, run! Run! No.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:49.895
No, not that way. Away from the cliff!

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.157
I'm not going to let Mama
take you away again.

01:10:00.155 --> 01:10:04.034
Lily, stop! Come on.
Come on. Here, girl. Come on, Lily.

01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:09.081
Come on. Look. Oh, look. Yeah.

01:10:14.628 --> 01:10:18.382
Come on. Look. Oh, yeah. Lily.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:21.427
Oh, wow. Yeah.

01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:23.887
Oh, come on.

01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:27.725
Enough! This is crazy.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:30.477
- Lily's not a dog.

01:10:30.644 --> 01:10:33.105
She's a beautiful little girl
who I've grown to love.

01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:36.734
I love all these children, Mama,
even if they don't all love me.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:41.113
- Lily loves you, too, Jody.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.823
And they belong in this world
with me and Dan.

01:10:42.990 --> 01:10:45.617
Because they deserve parents
who aren't decomposing.

01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.162
Good girl.

01:10:48.328 --> 01:10:51.457
- All right, enough.

01:10:52.541 --> 01:10:54.543
Where's the page?
Damn it, I can't find it.

01:10:54.710 --> 01:10:56.170
Forget it.

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.338
There, that worked. Maybe not.

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:19.902
Man, we need to stop smoking this shit.

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:26.200
Told you that shark
was going to come in handy.

01:11:26.366 --> 01:11:28.619
Thank you. Lily.

01:11:29.495 --> 01:11:31.497
Honey, thank God you're all right.

01:11:44.176 --> 01:11:47.012
- Your cue is coming up.
- Oh, Kendra.

01:11:49.765 --> 01:11:52.017
Look, it's OK, girl.
Let's forget about what happened.

01:11:52.184 --> 01:11:56.355
- You are the Black Swan.
- No. It's you.

01:11:56.522 --> 01:12:00.442
Throwing Mama off the cliff has really
made me reevaluate my priorities.

01:12:00.609 --> 01:12:03.737
My family comes first.
You dance the Black Swan.

01:12:04.947 --> 01:12:07.449
Because sometimes in life...

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:13.789
<i>Introducing our new Swan Queen,
Miss Kendra Brooks.</i>

01:12:35.561 --> 01:12:38.814
- This is not ballet.
- No, it the hell ain't.

01:12:40.691 --> 01:12:42.401
This some bullshit.

01:12:51.326 --> 01:12:54.162
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:57.249
That's what I'm talking about!
Right? Right?

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:58.792
You know that shit, right?

01:12:58.959 --> 01:13:01.962
<i>And so our story ends.</i>

01:13:02.129 --> 01:13:04.298
<i>If anything is to be learned from this,</i>

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:07.426
<i>it's that mankind is a pathetic race</i>

01:13:07.593 --> 01:13:10.971
<i>and apes need to take over this planet.</i>

01:13:11.138 --> 01:13:14.600
<i>Enjoy Earth while you still got it.</i>

01:13:57.392 --> 01:14:01.063
Well, we'll see how you like it
once the swan consumes you!

01:14:22.501 --> 01:14:25.712
I cannot hold it that long.
It's, like... it's so long.

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:58.412
We're kissing.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.419
Cut! Cut!

01:15:07.129 --> 01:15:08.547
- Cut!

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.301
We're kissing.

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:35.699
Cut!

01:15:49.046 --> 01:15:51.465
- What happened?
- Guy was in the shot.

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:54.176
- Ah.
- Cut!

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:55.635
But was he dressed like a demon?

01:15:58.764 --> 01:16:00.524
Do the second "my penis"
as a question.

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:02.768
OK. And then "my other penis"
is a question also?

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:04.102
- Yeah.

01:16:04.269 --> 01:16:06.188
But remember, you're jumping
to "What the hell is that?"

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:08.440
- I know. I don't know why.
- You're jumping... Yeah.

01:16:08.607 --> 01:16:10.317
There's just so many penises.

01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:12.861
Welcome to Hollywood.

01:16:15.906 --> 01:16:18.283
- I'm ready for it.
- Hey.

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:19.951
I'm OK With this.

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:23.038
That's the temporary nurses' shower.

01:16:23.205 --> 01:16:25.123
- And we're painting it.
- Cut.

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:28.293
That's the... temporary nurses' shower.

01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:30.087
I'm OK With this.

01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:35.967
Sorry, you guys. I...

01:16:39.471 --> 01:16:40.806
I'm OK With this.

01:16:40.972 --> 01:16:44.392
That's the nurses'
temporary locker room,

01:16:44.559 --> 01:16:46.186
and we're repainting it.

01:16:47.896 --> 01:16:49.147
Cut.

01:16:56.071 --> 01:16:59.282
Ouch. Hello here!

01:17:02.410 --> 01:17:03.495
B mark!

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.580
- And background.
- Action!

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.168
Oh!

01:17:15.632 --> 01:17:18.760
Jody! Thank God I caught you.

01:17:19.719 --> 01:17:22.556
I forgot to tell you, now that
you are the Swan Queen...

01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:27.853
Suck my...

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:32.607
I'll save you, Snoop Dogg.

01:17:32.774 --> 01:17:35.902
My name ain't Snoop Dogg
in this... movie, man!

01:17:41.158 --> 01:17:43.368
- Well, I mean, I...
- Sh...

01:17:53.503 --> 01:17:54.504
Stop it!

01:17:54.671 --> 01:17:56.548
We're good. We're good.

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.888
Now prepare for a night
of unparalleled passion.

01:18:03.054 --> 01:18:05.724
- Oh, wait, wait, Mr. Grey...
- The safe word is "deeper."

01:18:05.891 --> 01:18:06.892
- What?

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.066
Damn! Ow!

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:16.568
Whoa!

01:18:20.697 --> 01:18:22.498
What does all this
have to do with the ballet?

01:18:22.657 --> 01:18:26.161
- Ballet?
- Yes. Aren't you donating millions?

01:18:26.328 --> 01:18:28.079
Millions? What...? I'm broke.

01:18:28.246 --> 01:18:30.248
Every cent I have
has been put into this room.

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:37.297
I don't know what I'm going to do.

01:18:37.464 --> 01:18:40.008
Oh, cry me a river.

01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:44.596
I'm going to need a little help.
I don't have a penis.

01:19:02.822 --> 01:19:04.366
It does not come off.

01:19:04.532 --> 01:19:06.576
It does not come off. I'm sorry.

01:19:09.704 --> 01:19:11.664
I'm getting tired of talking
about this...

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:13.750
In the woods with this man.

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:17.462
...man, we keep going in
circles, talking about a... man.

01:19:17.629 --> 01:19:18.990
Let's talk about a... man,

01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:20.799
- or getting some...
- Getting some...

01:19:20.966 --> 01:19:23.086
Talking about...
these two dudes in the woods.

01:19:23.134 --> 01:19:27.222
If we had a... here, she could
wash our... off right now.

01:19:27.389 --> 01:19:29.891
You understand me?
That's the way I would say it.

01:19:33.019 --> 01:19:34.771
Hey, babe, check out
this psychic's book for a clue.

01:19:34.938 --> 01:19:37.691
- It really freaks me out.
- Come on, there's nothing to be...

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:39.609
Nuh!

01:19:39.776 --> 01:19:42.487
These books are all...

01:19:42.654 --> 01:19:45.198
There's nothing to be scared...

01:19:50.412 --> 01:19:53.498
...to be scared...

01:19:54.791 --> 01:19:56.191
Oh, there's nothing to be scared...

01:19:56.293 --> 01:19:58.086
Oh, wrong animal.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:02.632
...be scared... A dinosaur?

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:08.805
What does this have to do with...?

01:20:13.143 --> 01:20:14.185
I know. Sorry.

01:20:16.021 --> 01:20:18.064
And... action!

01:20:18.231 --> 01:20:21.860
- What does this have to do with...?
- Sorry.

01:20:25.530 --> 01:20:29.326
You just keep cupping your boobs.
OK, sorry.

01:20:47.469 --> 01:20:49.471
OK, how do we know who's a witch?

01:20:52.098 --> 01:20:54.225
Do they have a broom?

01:20:54.392 --> 01:20:55.810
Do they have a pointy nose?

01:21:02.192 --> 01:21:06.279
I'm... I'm going to pee my pants!

01:21:13.995 --> 01:21:15.372
So, what, I didn't get the part?

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.415
Where's everybody going?

01:27:27.076 --> 01:27:29.328
I just had the most bizarro dream.

01:27:29.495 --> 01:27:31.664
Demons, apes, a ballet.

01:27:31.831 --> 01:27:34.125
You have a very active subconscious.

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:36.502
Anyway, the idea took hold.

01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:39.547
Lindsay Lohan's coming over
to spend the night with you.

01:27:39.714 --> 01:27:41.549
- Awesome!

01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:49.932
You were driving.
