WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:40.506 --> 01:42.531
The Spellstone!

01:44.776 --> 01:48.234
It better be worth all this
trouble, Evil-Lyn.

01:48.547 --> 01:51.543
It will be, Skeletor. That I promise you.

01:55.521 --> 01:59.287
Oto, redundis, serenandum ardor!

02:29.454 --> 02:30.944
Now watch, closely.

02:31.323 --> 02:33.188
The hand is quicker than the eye.

02:37.896 --> 02:38.920
Choose.

02:44.100 --> 02:47.433
No, my prince, the marble is here.
Huh?

02:50.375 --> 02:53.811
You're right, Orko,
the hand is quicker than the eye.

02:54.346 --> 02:55.438
How'd you do that?

02:55.781 --> 02:58.341
Uh-uh-uh,
we magicians never reveal our secrets.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.758
So, just what is it that this new
invention of yours will do, Duncan?

03:13.131 --> 03:14.894
My weather controlling satellite will...

03:15.367 --> 03:17.961
make us masters of the
seasons, Your Majesty.

03:21.073 --> 03:23.341
It can turn a cloudy sky to clear.

03:23.575 --> 03:25.566
Then, proceed, by all means.

03:30.449 --> 03:31.516
It works!

03:34.953 --> 03:36.420
Duncan, what's wrong?

03:36.688 --> 03:38.781
I don't know, Your Majesty.

03:47.165 --> 03:50.430
Adam, my machine couldn't
have made a storm like this.

03:50.869 --> 03:54.236
But I know of something that could.
The Spellstone.

03:54.539 --> 03:55.597
The Spellstone?

03:55.841 --> 03:57.570
I thought it was only a legend.

03:58.577 --> 03:59.908
Oh, it's real enough.

04:00.278 --> 04:03.645
But to do this, it must have fallen
into the hands of someone evil.

04:04.016 --> 04:06.348
I have an idea who that might be.

04:06.852 --> 04:07.978
Come on, Cringer.

04:09.287 --> 04:14.823
If that means danger,
I'd rather stay right here, Adam. Adam?

04:25.337 --> 04:27.862
By the power of Grayskull!

04:33.478 --> 04:37.414
I have the power!

04:57.936 --> 05:00.530
The storm works its evil.

05:01.006 --> 05:05.500
Soon, all Eternia will be devastated
and I will reign supreme.

05:05.844 --> 05:07.937
You mean, we, Skeletor.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.374
Only if you do your part right, Evil-Lyn.

05:15.754 --> 05:19.781
A voice in the crowd can do more
damage than even this storm.

05:26.598 --> 05:27.895
According to legend...

05:28.133 --> 05:30.465
The Spellstone is here
in the Region of Flame.

05:30.836 --> 05:34.272
Skeletor must have broken
into the Temple of the Fire People.

05:34.573 --> 05:36.097
Who are the Fire People?

05:36.408 --> 05:37.636
A fierce tribe.

05:38.043 --> 05:40.273
That doesn't like strangers.

05:46.918 --> 05:49.751
I-I have a feeling neither does he.

05:53.024 --> 05:54.753
Any ideas, He-Man?

05:55.093 --> 05:58.290
Just watch. Electricity works everytime.

06:03.034 --> 06:06.094
Let's get to that temple
before anything else happens.

06:35.233 --> 06:37.667
More pressure, Teela!
Right, father.

06:39.437 --> 06:42.838
Spellstone! Do my bidding!

06:49.481 --> 06:50.481
Teela!

06:54.052 --> 06:57.112
I'm alright, father.
Just had the wind knocked out of me.

06:57.422 --> 06:59.890
Keep fighting the blaze. I'll be back.

07:03.094 --> 07:07.030
Our house! It burned to the ground!

07:07.399 --> 07:09.264
Everything we had is gone, father.

07:09.568 --> 07:11.866
The king's fault and Man-At-Arms.

07:12.204 --> 07:13.204
What do you mean?

07:13.471 --> 07:16.099
Their inventions have angered
the elders of Eternia...

07:16.374 --> 07:17.839
They have brought forth this storm.

07:18.176 --> 07:22.772
The only way to stop it is to
punish those who are responsible.

07:23.014 --> 07:25.312
No!  You must be mistaken.

07:26.918 --> 07:28.010
The woman is right.

07:28.320 --> 07:29.719
How can we save ourselves?

07:30.255 --> 07:33.315
We must act quickly,
or the elders will destroy us all.

07:33.525 --> 07:36.756
In ancient times,
what was the worst punishment?

07:37.796 --> 07:39.093
The Creeping...

07:39.431 --> 07:40.489
Horak.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.464
Father, do you know where it is?

07:45.503 --> 07:46.902
Yes.

07:47.205 --> 07:48.467
Then take me to it.

07:51.643 --> 07:52.803
Here's the temple.

07:53.178 --> 07:55.009
But where is the Spellstone?

07:56.214 --> 07:58.375
Is this what you're looking for?

07:58.884 --> 07:59.884
Skeletor!

08:00.151 --> 08:01.948
Robots, attack!

08:10.929 --> 08:14.023
Skeletor, you make it too easy.

08:14.047 --> 08:15.047
Hey!

08:21.573 --> 08:23.768
Just what I love.

08:24.776 --> 08:27.267
A great big toy.

08:31.683 --> 08:32.683
King Randor!

08:33.018 --> 08:35.986
You have strayed from the
ways of the Eternian Elders!

08:36.187 --> 08:38.347
That voice.  I've heard it before.

08:38.657 --> 08:41.023
You have brought this curse upon us.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.419
It's Evil-Lyn!

08:46.197 --> 08:50.327
We must save ourselves
and you must pay.

08:50.735 --> 08:52.669
Give me the Creeping Horak.

08:52.904 --> 08:57.307
I beg you! Don't use it. It's too terrible.

08:57.575 --> 09:00.874
Don't believe her!
She isn't what she seems!

09:05.650 --> 09:09.108
Fool! You think this will hold me?

09:14.492 --> 09:15.789
Give me that!

09:21.132 --> 09:25.690
The Creeping Horak will grow until
it completely fills the palace.

09:38.516 --> 09:40.279
Faster, it's gaining on us.

09:42.087 --> 09:44.214
What is that thing?
The Creeping Horak.

09:44.456 --> 09:46.720
Long ago, it was used to punish criminals.

09:48.126 --> 09:49.684
They'd be locked in their houses.

09:50.061 --> 09:52.791
The Horak would grow over it
until all the air was squeezed out.

09:53.064 --> 09:54.292
How horrible.

09:54.566 --> 09:56.550
It'll even be... It'll be even,

09:56.575 --> 09:58.955
more horrible if it happens to us.

10:27.832 --> 10:29.629
Can't shake him off.

10:34.472 --> 10:37.100
But maybe I can shake him up.

10:52.090 --> 10:57.453
Argh. I can't go forward or backward...

10:57.562 --> 11:00.463
so, how about up?

11:01.900 --> 11:05.233
There's a big difference
between a cat and a robot.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.704
The cat lands on his feet.

11:12.077 --> 11:13.271
Your robots are nothing...

11:13.545 --> 11:15.710
more than scrap metal, Skeletor.

11:16.047 --> 11:20.081
And as for you...
Not so fast, He-Man.

11:20.185 --> 11:21.243
Behold.

11:25.857 --> 11:26.857
Teela!

11:31.763 --> 11:34.891
There, the King and the Queen.

11:35.867 --> 11:41.669
Look hard, heroes, for it's the
last time you will ever see them.

11:51.783 --> 11:55.082
I think our friends could use a nice swim.

12:12.203 --> 12:13.503
Follow me.

12:20.979 --> 12:22.606
Run fast, warriors!

12:22.947 --> 12:25.006
There's just one way out, He-Man.

12:25.316 --> 12:27.277
The others lead to destruction.

12:29.854 --> 12:33.688
Come, Trap Jaw,
to the palace and my triumph.

12:33.958 --> 12:37.121
But what if He-Man and the
others find their way out?

12:37.462 --> 12:38.656
Never fear, fool.

12:39.564 --> 12:42.795
There is no way out.

12:53.978 --> 12:54.978
In here.

13:06.958 --> 13:09.620
Let's see what it will do against this.

13:15.033 --> 13:16.261
A dead end.

13:19.204 --> 13:20.204
Solid rock.

13:20.438 --> 13:22.030
But wait a minute.

13:24.175 --> 13:25.233
It's hollow.

13:29.380 --> 13:32.213
Boy, would I give for
a trap door right now.

13:32.517 --> 13:34.109
If you can't find
a trap door...

13:38.656 --> 13:39.748
You make one.

13:44.362 --> 13:46.057
Well, that takes care of the water.

13:46.297 --> 13:47.924
Now, how do we get out of here?

13:52.770 --> 13:55.398
Talk about fast service.

13:55.673 --> 13:58.642
Finally, someone on our side.

14:04.515 --> 14:06.710
Or maybe not.

14:11.623 --> 14:14.023
Let's see how this
monster feels about fire.

14:15.126 --> 14:16.559
Teela, no!

14:23.334 --> 14:24.494
Run, Teela.

14:27.105 --> 14:30.308
I am Helios.
King of Fire People.

14:30.308 --> 14:33.141
You have stolen the Spellstone.

14:33.444 --> 14:35.878
No, you're mistaken. We're on your side.

14:36.147 --> 14:37.842
We want to find it and return it.

14:38.049 --> 14:40.210
Liar.  Seize them.

14:41.953 --> 14:44.786
Try not to hurt them.
They're not our enemies.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.153
I wish you'd tell them that.

14:56.034 --> 14:58.229
There's nothing to you.

15:00.471 --> 15:02.564
But you sure do pack a wallop.

15:05.743 --> 15:08.541
They've gotta be kidding. What can you do?

15:11.883 --> 15:13.282
Sorry I asked!

15:20.358 --> 15:22.189
We're running out of rooms.

15:25.396 --> 15:26.522
Stand clear!

15:31.602 --> 15:34.366
There's no effect. It's not stopping it.

15:35.573 --> 15:36.699
Fall back!

15:40.345 --> 15:42.108
Oh no.

15:44.882 --> 15:47.112
Fly, Orko!  Fly!

15:51.055 --> 15:54.286
Tell me where you've hidden the Spellstone.

15:54.525 --> 15:56.891
How can I make you
understand we're friends?

15:57.228 --> 16:00.823
Fire People don't make
friends with thieves.

16:01.799 --> 16:03.596
I won't fight you.

16:13.611 --> 16:16.011
That one nearly singed my tail feathers.

16:33.798 --> 16:35.095
Help me.

16:52.350 --> 16:55.683
You wouldn't have saved
me, if you were evil.

16:56.120 --> 16:59.783
Go in peace and may you
find the Spellstone.

17:00.825 --> 17:02.690
The last room in the palace.

17:02.927 --> 17:05.794
I built this hydraulic
door to withstand anything.

17:06.063 --> 17:07.325
It's our last chance.

17:30.521 --> 17:33.820
You've tricked us, Skeletor.
But you won't get away with it.

17:34.125 --> 17:37.390
Who will stop me? Not you!

17:38.062 --> 17:40.423
How about me, Skeletor.

17:40.631 --> 17:41.689
He-Man!

17:44.936 --> 17:49.737
You blundering skull-face.
You said you'd taken care of him.

17:50.641 --> 17:51.665
And I will.

17:56.547 --> 17:58.572
Evil-Lyn the Spellstone!

18:09.494 --> 18:12.895
Stratos, can you reach the Spellstone?

18:13.264 --> 18:14.264
I'll try.

18:15.566 --> 18:17.090
This is all our fault.

18:17.401 --> 18:19.028
Then let's do something.

18:21.005 --> 18:22.005
No.

18:29.313 --> 18:33.079
A person doesn't need
superpowers to be a hero.

18:33.484 --> 18:34.883
All he needs...

18:35.286 --> 18:36.344
is bravery.

18:36.988 --> 18:39.081
You forgot that, Skeletor.

18:39.423 --> 18:41.186
You haven't won, He-Man.

18:41.492 --> 18:45.258
The only thing that can destroy
the Horak is the Spellstone.

18:45.596 --> 18:49.589
And I command it to return
to the Region of Flame.

18:53.638 --> 18:55.367
Got to reach it.

19:18.329 --> 19:19.353
Got it!

19:21.532 --> 19:22.556
Heave...

19:22.733 --> 19:23.995
Ho!

19:30.007 --> 19:32.168
Now's our chance to escape.

19:39.317 --> 19:41.649
The Creeping Horak, it's gone.

19:41.886 --> 19:44.252
and so are Skeletor and Evil-Lyn.

19:44.555 --> 19:47.080
We'll meet up with them, again.

19:47.325 --> 19:48.690
And what about the Spellstone?

19:49.160 --> 19:51.355
It's gone back to the Fire People.

19:51.829 --> 19:53.126
Where it belongs.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.901
Well, peace has returned to Eternia.

19:59.136 --> 20:02.435
The sky is clear and the birds are singing.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.799
The only thing
missing is a rainbow.

20:05.142 --> 20:06.336
Let me handle that.

20:14.618 --> 20:15.618
Uh-oh!

20:15.642 --> 20:16.642
Yikes!

20:31.936 --> 20:34.598
You've all seen how
Orko's magical tricks...

20:34.872 --> 20:36.669
don't always go the way he planned.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.633
Sometimes they backfire on him.

20:38.943 --> 20:41.173
The same thing is true of practical jokes.

20:41.512 --> 20:43.844
Sometimes they don't go
the way you planned...

20:44.114 --> 20:46.446
and you, or someone else, can get hurt.

20:46.784 --> 20:50.151
So be sure and think twice before
playing a joke or a trick on anybody.

20:50.487 --> 20:53.078
It might not go the way you planned
and someone could wind up...

20:53.224 --> 20:56.057
losing a finger, or an
arm, or may be even an eye.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.328
And no joke is worth that, is it?

20:58.662 --> 20:59.720
See you again soon.
