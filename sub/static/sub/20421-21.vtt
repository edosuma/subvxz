WEBVTT

00:11.490 --> 00:13.240
What is it, Akatsuki?

00:13.240 --> 00:15.120
N-Nothing, just...

00:15.630 --> 00:17.940
Aren't you going to the party, my lord?

00:18.260 --> 00:21.450
No, I don't care for those flashy events.

00:22.100 --> 00:23.710
I'll let Crusty handle it.

00:24.580 --> 00:25.820
Oh...

02:04.310 --> 02:08.150
Oh, I hear you did a fantastic job!

02:08.150 --> 02:11.360
I'm told you easily defeated the Goblin General.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.730
I believe that victory was only possible

02:14.730 --> 02:18.150
because People of the Land and 
adventurers worked together.

02:18.150 --> 02:20.990
<i>Please. You don't really think that.</i>

02:21.220 --> 02:23.130
He's so strong.

02:23.130 --> 02:24.610
He's wonderful!

02:30.250 --> 02:36.210
<b>The Two of Us Shall Waltz</b>

02:32.610 --> 02:34.150
The Two of Us Shall Waltz.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.480
The food here is great!

02:39.480 --> 02:44.160
Shiroe and his buddies ate this stuff 
every day during the conferences?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.320
Wherever you eat it,

02:46.320 --> 02:50.880
the food you enjoy with friends 
is the most delicious.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.830
Where's the hide-and-seek genius?

02:52.830 --> 02:54.200
Where is she?

02:54.200 --> 02:56.110
Isn't she here today?

02:56.440 --> 02:57.520
What's wrong?

02:57.520 --> 02:58.730
You aren't eating.

02:59.190 --> 03:01.620
We haven't wiped out the goblins,

03:02.040 --> 03:04.060
so how can we celebrate victory?

03:04.570 --> 03:09.000
It's been a month since we pinned the 
goblin army on the Zantleaf Peninsula.

03:09.510 --> 03:14.590
The Goblin King is still at their 
headquarters in Seventh Fall.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.960
Why can't we go destroy him right now?

03:17.960 --> 03:22.280
It's more important to build our 
relationships with the People of the Land.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.210
That was Shiroe's decision.

03:27.360 --> 03:29.110
Over the past month,

03:29.110 --> 03:33.270
the Round Table has signed basic 
trade and peace treaties

03:33.270 --> 03:37.150
with Eastal's League of Freedom Cities.

03:38.080 --> 03:43.670
The Round Table has issued many goblin-fighting
quests to adventures in Akihabara,

03:43.670 --> 03:45.780
which has kept the goblins in Zantleaf.

03:46.380 --> 03:48.140
Then this is

03:48.140 --> 03:53.010
reminding everyone that adventurers 
are accepting quests again.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.220
And if we defeat their king first,

03:56.220 --> 03:59.500
the goblins will go out of control without a leader.

03:59.500 --> 04:03.930
All of this is part of Shiroe's plan 
to take out Seventh Fall.

04:03.930 --> 04:05.040
I understand...

04:05.360 --> 04:08.170
He's thinking several steps ahead.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.430
Are you certain?

04:11.600 --> 04:15.100
I can really join Log Horizon?

04:15.100 --> 04:17.070
Yes, that's fine.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.040
I'll let Shiro know.

04:19.040 --> 04:20.750
Th-Thank you!

04:20.750 --> 04:24.070
After all you've done, and 
all the help you've given me...

04:24.070 --> 04:27.450
Friends should stay together, right?

04:28.930 --> 04:32.040
Leave Miss Isuzu to me.

04:32.040 --> 04:35.850
With the strength of the adventurer 
Rundel Haus Code, Akihabara isâ€”

04:35.850 --> 04:38.590
Thank you! Thank you!

04:40.100 --> 04:42.410
I'm happy for Isuzu.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.220
Shiroe?

04:47.600 --> 04:49.390
Shiroe?

04:49.390 --> 04:50.940
Why are you looking there?

04:50.940 --> 04:52.600
Is something wrong?

04:52.950 --> 04:55.120
Come to think of it, I haven't seen him.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.680
Shiroe is the Akihabara army's strategist.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.570
He should be one of the guests of honor.

05:01.570 --> 05:04.530
But he isn't even here to say hello?

05:04.530 --> 05:05.950
I see...

05:05.950 --> 05:08.490
That sounds like him.

05:08.490 --> 05:10.990
Sounding like him doesn't excuse this behavior!

05:10.990 --> 05:11.610
Meow...

05:17.190 --> 05:18.520
My lord...

05:18.880 --> 05:19.870
Um...

05:19.870 --> 05:21.550
Shiroe!

05:21.940 --> 05:22.760
Oh, no.

05:24.050 --> 05:26.480
Akatsuki, take care of this.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.560
My lord!

05:30.200 --> 05:31.930
Akatsuki!

05:31.930 --> 05:33.560
Let's get you changed!

05:33.560 --> 05:35.710
Oh, do you know where Shiroe is?

05:35.710 --> 05:38.680
Oh, you smell so good!

05:40.420 --> 05:41.940
Akatsuki?

05:45.390 --> 05:46.820
That was close.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.310
<b>Ooshima 
The Little Birdies</b>

05:48.970 --> 05:50.020
Ooshima?

05:50.720 --> 05:52.010
How's it going since then?

05:52.740 --> 05:54.490
What? In the west?

05:55.040 --> 05:56.890
The Demon Festival of Suzaku Gate?

05:57.960 --> 05:59.270
I see.

05:59.270 --> 06:00.550
So that's it.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.110
So we were just ripping up goblins, 
tossing them aside...

06:06.110 --> 06:08.720
You could hear the Phoenix's roar 
echo through the whole valley!

06:08.910 --> 06:10.230
Boom!

06:10.230 --> 06:15.600
They don't know that they'll lose some 
of their memories if they die.

06:15.870 --> 06:21.020
We've only told the Round Table's 
major members about that.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.280
Well, knowing Shiro, I'm sure he'll handle it.

06:26.340 --> 06:30.340
I'd love it if you'd visit my territory sometime.

06:30.340 --> 06:35.400
I'd love for you to tell my troops 
some tales of your victories!

06:35.400 --> 06:38.180
No, no, please visit me, as well!

06:38.180 --> 06:44.170
My daughter is seeking a husband, 
and I think you'd get along well.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.340
Grandfather, is that...

06:53.030 --> 06:54.610
And then? And then?

06:54.610 --> 06:55.990
What happened?

06:56.580 --> 07:02.210
And then, heroes from a 
different world came to ours.

07:04.120 --> 07:09.110
They were immortal, strong, and wise.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.600
I know that!

07:10.600 --> 07:12.020
The Precursors, right?

07:12.020 --> 07:14.060
The Izumo Knights, right?

07:14.060 --> 07:19.690
No, they were far more 
powerful than the Precursors.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.670
Oh, my!

07:21.030 --> 07:25.210
One day, the king of monsters 
appeared with his army,

07:25.210 --> 07:27.860
burning villages, destroying castles,

07:27.860 --> 07:30.680
and ruining fields.

07:31.600 --> 07:36.220
The heroes came quickly, and defeated 
the monsters, one after the next.

07:36.650 --> 07:41.320
The monsters that had covered the beaches, 
those that blackened the forest...

07:42.520 --> 07:45.660
But during the battle,

07:45.660 --> 07:49.030
one of them lost his life.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.540
That's strange...

07:52.540 --> 07:54.660
Weren't they immortal?

07:55.120 --> 08:00.040
The boy who died was merely one 
of the People of the Land,

08:00.040 --> 08:03.230
one who longed to be one of those heroes.

08:03.820 --> 08:04.750
Oh, my!

08:05.200 --> 08:10.740
The heroes begged their wizard to save him.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.170
But not even their wizard

08:13.170 --> 08:16.330
knew how to restore one of 
the People of the Land.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.260
And then?

08:18.260 --> 08:19.720
What happened next?

08:20.870 --> 08:24.700
So the wizard thought, and then, of all things,

08:24.700 --> 08:30.490
he created a new form of magic 
that hadn't existed in this world.

08:32.670 --> 08:38.170
And so, the young boy of the 
People of the Land became a hero.

08:39.950 --> 08:43.610
But after that, the wizard...

08:43.900 --> 08:45.340
What? What?

08:46.180 --> 08:47.770
That's all for today.

08:47.770 --> 08:50.110
We'll continue the story next time.

08:50.110 --> 08:51.670
Aww!

08:51.670 --> 08:54.130
No, there's no way...

08:59.370 --> 09:01.670
Oh, hello there.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.770
I am honored by your visit.

09:04.060 --> 09:07.620
And congratulations, Shiroe.

09:08.530 --> 09:09.820
For what?

09:10.520 --> 09:13.050
The creation of a new type of magic.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.950
What? You noticed?

09:16.310 --> 09:17.650
A month ago,

09:17.650 --> 09:22.480
I sensed a magic unknown to me in the 
east, and I saw its light fill the sky.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.900
It was world-class magic,

09:24.900 --> 09:29.460
that which can alter the laws, fate, 
and very existence of the world.

09:29.700 --> 09:34.590
You are every bit the man I thought you were.

09:35.170 --> 09:38.340
If I hadn't met you, I never would've had the idea.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.850
You honor me.

09:40.850 --> 09:42.110
Incidentally,

09:42.110 --> 09:47.620
I also felt a powerful magic in 
the western sky, just recently.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.980
The western sky?

09:49.320 --> 09:54.740
It seems that one besides yourself 
has created a new form of magic.

09:55.730 --> 09:59.310
One of the adventurers, I assume.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.520
The western sky... Adventurers...

10:12.030 --> 10:13.100
That means

10:13.690 --> 10:16.280
it would have to be in Minami, right?

10:18.360 --> 10:22.980
<i>Akihabara, Shibuya, Minami, Susukino, Nakasu...</i>

10:23.390 --> 10:26.890
<i>Just as Akihabara has changed 
since our arrival in this world,</i>

10:26.890 --> 10:28.840
<i>the other cities have changed, as well.</i>

10:29.810 --> 10:34.730
<i>Almost all the Shibuya adventurers 
have gone to Akihabara.</i>

10:35.800 --> 10:41.070
<i>Susukino never recovered from the 
deterioration it suffered after the Apocalypse.</i>

10:42.200 --> 10:44.050
<i>Ever since we saved Serara,</i>

10:44.050 --> 10:47.510
<i>we've sent several armies up to evacuate 
anyone who wanted to leave.</i>

10:48.460 --> 10:49.780
<i>But there are still</i>

10:49.780 --> 10:54.090
<i>over two hundred adventurers who continue 
ruling over the People of the Land.</i>

10:55.480 --> 10:57.440
<i>And Minami...</i>

10:58.350 --> 11:02.610
Yamato was once united as 
a single kingdom, right?

11:02.610 --> 11:03.740
Yes...

11:03.740 --> 11:05.300
After we last spoke, I studied up.

11:06.120 --> 11:10.480
As I recall, the Unified Westelande Empire...

11:11.760 --> 11:16.690
was swallowed up in the history of battles with 
demi-humans and the Luquenje, and died out.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.520
But the Cowen family is distantly related.

11:19.800 --> 11:20.770
Yes.

11:20.770 --> 11:23.760
As is the Holy Empire Westelande,

11:23.760 --> 11:26.700
which rules the country's western portion.

11:27.380 --> 11:31.040
Within the territory is a city 
of adventurers, Minami.

11:31.740 --> 11:35.310
And I'm told that a certain guild rules Minami.

11:36.720 --> 11:39.420
Are you aware that the Demon Festival 
of Suzaku Gate occurred in the west?

11:40.090 --> 11:41.740
I am.

11:41.740 --> 11:45.640
Though the eastern nobles don't 
seem to have noticed yet.

11:47.200 --> 11:51.330
The Demon Festival of Suzaku Gate is similar 
to the Return of the Goblin King.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.810
It's an event that occurs at set intervals.

11:54.470 --> 11:58.300
It appears the Izumo Knights 
were involved with it, as well.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.310
<i>The Demon Festival of Suzaku Gate...</i>

12:05.830 --> 12:07.170
<i>Hints of magic...</i>

12:08.210 --> 12:10.070
<i>Something is happening in Minami.</i>

12:10.680 --> 12:12.660
I found you, Shiroe.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.960
Hide-and-seek is over.

12:19.630 --> 12:21.050
And so,

12:21.550 --> 12:24.590
you'll be doing your share of the cleaning.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.180
Sounds good to me.

12:27.570 --> 12:31.470
Now you'll have the chance 
to see why they call me

12:31.470 --> 12:33.580
the "Dish-washing Fox of High Society."

12:33.940 --> 12:35.850
Dish-washing Fox?

12:35.850 --> 12:37.680
You couldn't make less sense if you tried.

12:37.860 --> 12:41.500
Rudy, stop eating only meat, 
and have some vegetables.

12:42.570 --> 12:44.790
No, there's no need for that...

12:44.790 --> 12:46.830
Just eat it! Come on!

12:46.830 --> 12:48.590
No! Anything but that!

12:48.590 --> 12:49.200
Eat it!

12:49.200 --> 12:49.850
No!

12:55.320 --> 12:56.360
Huh?

12:56.360 --> 12:57.610
This song...

12:58.040 --> 13:01.350
This was <i>Elder Tale</i>'s theme song 
when it was a game.

13:01.830 --> 13:04.340
It really is a nice song...

13:04.340 --> 13:07.560
But nobody's dancing.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.350
Both the People of the Land

13:16.080 --> 13:19.540
and the adventurers are too afraid 
of each other to dance.

13:20.280 --> 13:25.480
For the sake of both, 
someone should take the lead.

13:26.080 --> 13:29.830
I think you and I have that responsibility.

13:30.530 --> 13:31.760
Responsibility...

13:48.170 --> 13:49.460
Lenessia,

13:50.730 --> 13:56.980
it was not Eastal that asked the 
adventurers for help with the goblins.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.570
It was you yourself, Lenessia.

14:02.070 --> 14:04.170
Grandfather, that's...

14:04.700 --> 14:10.870
Eastal expresses its deepest thanks 
to the adventurers of Akihabara,

14:10.870 --> 14:14.250
but we have no obligation to do more.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.370
In other words,

14:17.230 --> 14:23.000
you have no intention of offering them 
reward money, or compensation money?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.490
I must take responsibility myself?

14:26.380 --> 14:29.890
My city, Maihama, will be establishing 
an embassy in Akihabara,

14:30.380 --> 14:32.620
and will be sending an ambassador.

14:33.060 --> 14:34.180
You can't mean...

14:34.980 --> 14:37.980
You spoke of showing respect.

14:39.340 --> 14:42.260
Thus, it is your responsibility 
to stay with them,

14:42.260 --> 14:47.400
and to thank them whenever 
the opportunity arises.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.580
No, it's simple courtesy, is it not?

14:53.680 --> 14:55.620
It comes with three meals and a nap.

14:57.150 --> 14:59.100
It comes with three meals and a nap.

15:00.370 --> 15:03.550
I believe you witnessed this yesterday,

15:04.810 --> 15:08.930
but adventurers aren't as concerned 
with formalities as nobles are.

15:09.630 --> 15:12.550
There are few tea parties or balls.

15:13.540 --> 15:16.030
That's the kind of town you'll be coming to.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.970
It should allow you to enjoy a 
life with three meals and a nap,

15:18.970 --> 15:21.060
never having to leave the house.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.130
Then...

15:24.170 --> 15:27.810
<i>My old dream of enjoying three 
days of such laziness</i>

15:27.810 --> 15:29.950
<i>that I don't even take a bath?</i>

15:30.320 --> 15:34.200
Well, as long as it doesn't 
go much past three days.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.980
<i>He read my mind again!</i>

15:39.010 --> 15:40.460
<i>No, no...</i>

15:40.460 --> 15:42.580
<i>I must not let my guard down.</i>

15:42.920 --> 15:46.520
<i>He is a monster that can read minds.</i>

15:46.520 --> 15:47.340
<i>Yes!</i>

15:48.000 --> 15:50.680
<i>He's a mind-reading monster!</i>

15:51.090 --> 15:53.240
He's so wonderful!

15:53.830 --> 15:57.590
Now I can finally return to 
my life of self-indulgence.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.760
Right, Crusty?

15:58.760 --> 16:01.360
I don't know...

16:01.760 --> 16:05.570
You seem to have a habit 
of ruining it for yourself.

16:06.140 --> 16:07.090
Ruiningâ€”

16:12.630 --> 16:14.460
U-Um...

16:14.460 --> 16:17.160
What's wrong, Serara?

16:17.410 --> 16:20.140
I... I'm...

16:20.140 --> 16:21.090
Meow?

16:21.420 --> 16:26.590
I'm really grateful to you for 
saving me in Susukino.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.670
But...

16:29.680 --> 16:32.660
The Crescent Moon Alliance 
has done a lot for me,

16:33.180 --> 16:38.010
and I need to look after the new players, so...

16:38.010 --> 16:39.470
Um...

16:40.030 --> 16:42.280
So I...

16:42.640 --> 16:43.950
I...

16:44.980 --> 16:47.300
<i>I want to be with Nyanta, but...</i>

16:49.180 --> 16:50.520
I...

16:51.510 --> 16:53.160
can't stay in Log Horizon...

16:53.570 --> 16:54.770
Serara,

16:56.300 --> 16:59.330
you're such a good girl.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.920
Would you dance with me,

17:04.930 --> 17:06.270
Serara?

17:08.830 --> 17:10.930
Y-Yes!

17:11.930 --> 17:13.690
I'll go get something to drink.

17:13.690 --> 17:14.500
Okay.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.260
<i>Where is Shiroe?</i>

17:18.510 --> 17:22.920
Did you hear about how that 
Shiroe guy tricked the princess?

17:22.920 --> 17:24.140
I did...

17:24.140 --> 17:25.970
He dragged her out to the battlefield,

17:25.970 --> 17:28.150
and used her in negotiations 
with the People of the Land.

17:28.870 --> 17:31.040
You know, they call him a villain.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.280
Who is he, anyway? What's he 
doing in the Round Table?

17:34.280 --> 17:35.280
I know guys like that.

17:35.620 --> 17:39.340
They skulk around the shadows, 
taking advantage of people's weaknesses.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.560
You aren't going, my lord?

17:45.390 --> 17:46.910
I think I'll pass.

17:46.910 --> 17:48.920
Tonight, the star is Crusty.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.650
I'd just make things awkward and tire everyone.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.790
What's wrong?

17:57.180 --> 17:58.700
It's nothing.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.200
Nothing?

18:05.850 --> 18:07.940
Why are you smirking, my lord?

18:07.940 --> 18:09.050
I'm not smirking.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.180
No, you were smirking!

18:10.180 --> 18:11.480
That isn't true.

18:12.130 --> 18:14.680
You were... You were smirking!

18:17.050 --> 18:19.280
You're acting kind of strange.

18:21.030 --> 18:25.800
This time, I hardly did anything.

18:27.380 --> 18:33.020
Outside of battle, I think 
I only slowed you down.

18:35.340 --> 18:36.730
That's not true.

18:37.610 --> 18:42.020
You stayed with me the whole time, right?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.820
Ever since we came here,

18:45.390 --> 18:48.520
you've been my bodyguard, 
and got me information.

18:49.730 --> 18:54.680
You heard what Regan said, and you shared 
the secret about our memories with me.

18:56.020 --> 18:58.320
Even when I went to save Rundel Haus,

18:59.780 --> 19:01.860
you were with me.

19:04.390 --> 19:06.700
I've only made it this far because of you.

19:07.420 --> 19:08.480
It's true.

19:12.370 --> 19:16.340
<i>It's hard to express gratitude to someone...</i>

19:18.750 --> 19:21.470
Naotsugu!

19:21.790 --> 19:22.830
Let's dance, too.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.470
No, I don't really...

19:24.470 --> 19:25.560
Marie...

19:25.560 --> 19:26.850
There, there...

19:27.120 --> 19:29.640
Shall we dance, Miss Isuzu?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.300
S-Sure...

19:35.820 --> 19:38.270
You're very good, Serara.

19:38.270 --> 19:39.860
Th-Thank you.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.940
Would you like to dance?

19:41.940 --> 19:43.770
I'd be honored.

19:47.330 --> 19:48.370
Want to dance?

19:49.630 --> 19:51.810
No, my lord...

19:51.810 --> 19:54.490
I'm not good at dancing...

19:54.920 --> 19:56.880
You were practicing, right?

19:57.260 --> 19:59.130
No, that was, well...

20:07.520 --> 20:08.670
My lord...

20:09.670 --> 20:10.750
Don't laugh at me.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.470
I'm a beginner, too.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.030
I won't laugh.

20:15.070 --> 20:16.570
Oh, my...

20:16.570 --> 20:19.570
That is quite the dance, as well.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.640
My lord, is this a dance?

20:23.640 --> 20:25.060
Don't laugh.

20:26.200 --> 20:29.510
<b>Welcome, Princess Lenessia!!</b>

20:26.200 --> 20:29.510
<b>Love Lenessia</b>

20:29.890 --> 20:34.000
<i>Several days later, Lenessia came to Akihabara.</i>

20:37.750 --> 20:39.600
<i>Rather than making a big deal of it,</i>

20:39.600 --> 20:42.360
<i>I spread the news about the 
lost memories as a rumor.</i>

20:43.390 --> 20:46.770
<i>But naturally, many were scared.</i>

20:47.460 --> 20:50.140
But you only lose part of them, right?

20:50.140 --> 20:53.690
They say people who've died 
ten times have no problems.

20:53.690 --> 20:57.320
<b>Original Fishing Rods</b>

20:53.690 --> 20:57.320
<b>All Kinds 
of Lures!!</b>

20:53.950 --> 20:57.320
<i>But it didn't cause chaos.</i>

20:57.320 --> 21:01.120
They say the Round Table knew, but hid it.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.140
Seriously?

21:02.140 --> 21:05.190
Nah... I could see them doing it.

21:05.190 --> 21:07.110
Especially that Shiroe guy.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.540
<b>Shiroe Memo #6
Builds, Skills, and Subclasses</b>

21:14.540 --> 21:15.280
Minori?

21:16.300 --> 21:18.420
Is there still something you don't understand?

21:19.370 --> 21:21.460
No, I'm fine...

21:21.980 --> 21:22.770
I see.

21:24.430 --> 21:25.930
U-Um...

21:28.750 --> 21:30.770
I... I like...

21:32.210 --> 21:35.990
I'd like to ask you about my skills.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.030
<i>And then,</i>

21:42.710 --> 21:43.810
<i>autumn came.</i>

21:45.630 --> 21:46.690
A festival?

21:46.690 --> 21:50.480
Yes. The Committee for Crafting Guilds

21:50.480 --> 21:55.080
has mentioned displaying and 
selling their new products...

21:55.430 --> 21:56.590
And Marie said...

21:57.080 --> 21:58.580
It's October, right?

21:59.040 --> 22:01.070
And October is autumn, right?

21:59.080 --> 22:02.920
Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo!

22:01.360 --> 22:02.920
So festivals, right?

22:03.130 --> 22:04.610
I want to have a festival!

22:04.610 --> 22:06.630
That's what she said.

22:05.170 --> 22:08.690
 Come on, let's have on! It'll be so much fun!

22:07.060 --> 22:09.760
Um, Marie...

22:10.170 --> 22:12.620
Didn't you say the same thing in summer?

22:13.150 --> 22:15.100
So, when are we gonna do it?

22:15.330 --> 22:16.720
Two weeks.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.990
So soon?!

22:18.460 --> 22:20.100
That's almost no time at all!

22:20.100 --> 22:21.430
It'll be fine.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.870
Leave it to your strategist, Marie.

22:24.870 --> 22:25.990
Air glasses?

22:25.990 --> 22:27.780
I've got it all planned out.

22:27.780 --> 22:28.930
I call it...

22:28.930 --> 22:30.070
Ta-da!

<b>Scale Festival Plan</b>

22:31.780 --> 22:33.370
The Scale Festival?

24:05.680 --> 24:07.750
Two forks are offered to you...

24:07.750 --> 24:09.760
Two bites of cake on them.

24:09.760 --> 24:12.010
Which will you eat, and which won't you?

24:12.010 --> 24:14.890
Jealous glares and a demon's spell.

24:15.290 --> 24:16.180
Say, "Ahh."

24:16.730 --> 24:19.470
An all-you-can-eat cake buffet 
is the young girls' battlefield,

24:19.470 --> 24:21.600
where Shiroe's reality suddenly explodes.

<b>Swallow and Young Starling</b>
