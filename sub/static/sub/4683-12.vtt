WEBVTT

00:20.100 --> 00:22.900
I'm free!

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
- Hi, mom!
- Hi, girls!

01:43.266 --> 01:44.300
Aah!

02:17.733 --> 02:19.800
Little holiday cheer?

02:19.866 --> 02:21.800
Wanna give me some of that?

02:21.866 --> 02:24.966
No, this is a little
too rich for you, honey.

02:25.033 --> 02:28.200
You alright?
You look a little tired.

02:28.266 --> 02:30.433
I'm fine.
Not a care in the world.

02:31.633 --> 02:34.066
Did you eat?
I bet you need some breakfast.

02:34.133 --> 02:38.200
Ah, no, thanks.
I'm in a fast for a year or so.

02:38.266 --> 02:41.333
Say, don't you have school to go
to or something like that?

02:41.400 --> 02:44.000
Something like that.
School, then a checkup.

02:44.066 --> 02:45.366
Well, then go and be brilliant

02:45.433 --> 02:47.700
and say hello
to Dr. Clark for me.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.733
Are you sure you're okay?

02:50.800 --> 02:52.900
I'll be fine.

02:52.966 --> 02:54.933
Be good, dad.

03:04.233 --> 03:06.366
Holiday spirits.

03:06.433 --> 03:08.533
Go without guilt.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.866
Yeah, right, like
I'm just gonna sit there

03:33.933 --> 03:35.600
and let her rag on me like that.

03:35.666 --> 03:37.133
I heard you started it.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.766
Oh, please!
Good friend you are.

03:39.833 --> 03:42.633
Yeah, sure, you're right.
I must be a total jerk.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.466
Well, not a total jerk.

03:44.533 --> 03:47.233
If this doesn't make
David Silverman take notice

03:47.300 --> 03:49.133
I don't know what will.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.366
It's just a dance.

03:51.433 --> 03:53.966
Besides with legs like that,
you don't have to worry.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.133
In fact, why don't you go
without the dress?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.933
That way he'll notice for sure.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.033
'Oh, you think so?'

04:00.833 --> 04:03.200
This new cut
doesn't work at all.

04:03.266 --> 04:05.866
Well, I can't understand
why you're so hung up about it.

04:05.933 --> 04:08.566
I think it looks great.

04:08.633 --> 04:10.966
I'm not hung up.
I just don't wanna advertise.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.166
- Advertise what?
- My mutant forehead.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.200
It's just a little scar.

04:17.433 --> 04:18.900
Easy for you to say.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.066
Hey, I'm, I'm music chairman
at the dance tonight

04:21.133 --> 04:24.066
so pick me up at 7:30
or you're vaporized.

04:40.900 --> 04:43.500
Top of the line,
state of the art.

04:43.566 --> 04:45.100
I take it my checkup went okay?

04:45.166 --> 04:46.500
Mm-hmm.

04:46.566 --> 04:48.833
- How's your dad?
- Alright.

04:48.900 --> 04:51.233
It's tough for him.

04:51.300 --> 04:54.900
You know being a single parent's
no day at the beach.

04:54.966 --> 04:57.133
'Your mother and he were quite
a pair back in the '60s.'

04:58.700 --> 05:01.700
- She meant a lot to him.
- I never knew her.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.133
Seems like he can never
forget her.

05:06.433 --> 05:08.833
I guess that's the way
it's supposed to be.

05:10.466 --> 05:13.000
But it's bad sometimes.

05:13.066 --> 05:14.400
He's all alone.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.233
Yeah, I should give him a call.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.433
There's something else.

05:26.833 --> 05:29.600
I've been having these dreams.

05:29.666 --> 05:31.466
'Really intense and violent.'

05:31.533 --> 05:32.800
I see.

05:34.266 --> 05:37.333
'They're about accidents
and people getting hurt.'

05:38.700 --> 05:40.433
Me getting hurt sometimes.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.100
Not just just monster
in the closet sort of things.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.833
They seem like
they're really happening..

05:45.900 --> 05:48.333
...until I wake up.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.900
Well, sooner or later,
it happens to all of us.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.633
- What does?
- 'Life.'

05:54.700 --> 05:56.533
I mean, adult life.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.033
And when we're kids,
we have nightmares

05:58.100 --> 06:00.866
about things under our bed or..

06:00.933 --> 06:02.533
...being naked in school.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.266
'But it's nothing
compared to the real world'

06:04.333 --> 06:07.166
'of money, jobs, responsibility'

06:07.233 --> 06:08.900
the threat of nuclear disaster.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.866
As we grow older,
our nightmares change

06:12.933 --> 06:15.833
and we see things
as they really are

06:15.900 --> 06:18.733
and our subconscious complains.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.533
It's nothing to worry about.
You're just growing up, Amy.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.200
- It's normal then?
- I promise.

06:29.233 --> 06:30.733
Thanks, doc.

06:42.133 --> 06:44.700
- Hi, mom!
- Hi, girls.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.100
No! Little girl, don't!

07:34.866 --> 07:37.033
Eight o'clock? Damn!

07:41.666 --> 07:42.933
Jill?

07:43.000 --> 07:44.600
Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

07:44.666 --> 07:46.400
'Sorry about what?'

07:46.466 --> 07:48.533
I-I was studying.
I guess I nodded off.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.600
Look, give me ten minutes to get
ready. I'll be right over.

07:50.666 --> 07:52.900
'I don't understand.'

07:52.966 --> 07:55.033
We're going to the dance,
remember?

07:56.166 --> 07:58.400
'Very funny.'

07:58.466 --> 08:00.066
What?

08:00.133 --> 08:01.533
Look, I thought
you were looking forward

08:01.600 --> 08:03.533
to this, Miss Music Chairman.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.233
'Time to show off those hot legs
for a certain senior.'

08:07.300 --> 08:09.233
Why are you doing this, Amy?

08:11.300 --> 08:13.233
'I thought we were friends.'

08:41.833 --> 08:43.700
Amy, try and relax.

08:43.766 --> 08:45.333
I can't.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.533
These dreams are getting
worse and worse.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.066
More people are getting
hurt in them.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.000
Look, it's only a dream.

08:51.066 --> 08:53.433
No, it's not. There's more

08:53.500 --> 08:55.766
Look, you're gonna be a senior
next year, right?

08:55.833 --> 08:57.033
You're thinking about college.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.333
You're worried about your future

08:58.400 --> 09:00.133
and the stress and the pressure
is manifesting--

09:00.200 --> 09:03.866
No! The...things happening
in my dream

09:03.933 --> 09:06.400
are affecting the way
things are here now.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.433
I don't understand.

09:11.933 --> 09:13.866
I have this friend.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.133
Jill.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.133
Oh, Jill Scully.
Sure, I know her.

09:18.033 --> 09:20.533
Right. She's my best friend.

09:22.066 --> 09:25.066
I should know a lot
about my best friend, okay?

09:25.133 --> 09:27.333
'So I go to visit her
this morning to find out'

09:27.400 --> 09:30.366
'why she was so weird
on the phone last night.'

09:30.433 --> 09:32.133
I go to her house.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.966
I knock.

09:34.033 --> 09:36.000
She answers..

09:36.066 --> 09:38.033
...and she's in a wheelchair.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.666
- Right.
- No, not right.

09:41.733 --> 09:44.000
She wasn't in a wheelchair
yesterday.

09:44.066 --> 09:46.800
I ask her what's wrong and
she slams the door in my face.

09:49.066 --> 09:51.733
Amy, Jill's been in a wheelchair
practically all her life.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.733
No, that's not right!

09:54.733 --> 09:57.000
I have known her all my life.

09:58.266 --> 10:01.100
She's never been
in a wheelchair.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.533
I know that.

10:04.100 --> 10:06.200
Hmm, okay.

10:06.266 --> 10:08.533
Oh, God,
I'm not going crazy, am I?

10:09.600 --> 10:12.066
What you need
is a good night's sleep.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.800
- Sleep? I don't need sleep.
- You have to sleep.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.633
I'm gonna give you something to
calm down those dreams of yours.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.733
What about reality?

10:23.933 --> 10:25.333
First things first.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.000
You need to get
a good night's sleep

10:27.066 --> 10:28.500
and then we'll talk
again tomorrow.

10:28.566 --> 10:30.933
And if you're still feeling
the way you feel now

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
'then we'll take
stronger steps.'

11:27.333 --> 11:29.633
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, girls.

12:03.466 --> 12:04.800
No!

12:25.733 --> 12:28.133
The little girl was me!

13:07.700 --> 13:09.800
'You're the spitting image
of your mother.'

13:09.866 --> 13:12.466
'You know that?'

13:12.533 --> 13:16.933
With you around, I really don't
need any pictures of her.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.333
I just keep that one
for special occasions.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.700
Why didn't you tell me
how she died?

13:21.766 --> 13:24.600
What are you talking about
I did.

13:24.666 --> 13:28.566
It was an accident.
A stupid accident. I--

13:28.633 --> 13:30.733
And you told me
I was in the car with her

13:30.800 --> 13:32.200
and we hit a tree and--

13:32.266 --> 13:34.433
- That's right.
- That's a lie!

13:35.666 --> 13:37.633
That's not what happened at all!

13:38.833 --> 13:41.633
It's not even close.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.133
Jill and I, we were playing
in front of the car.

13:46.366 --> 13:49.666
Mom was hanging a plant
on a ladder.

13:49.733 --> 13:53.066
I threw the ball into the car
and I tried to get it.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.433
And somehow
I pulled the brake out.

13:57.266 --> 13:59.933
The car rolled,
i-it hit the ladder..

14:01.366 --> 14:03.000
...and mom fell.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.666
She fell and broke her neck.

14:04.733 --> 14:07.666
It wasn't an accident.
It was a nightmare!

14:07.733 --> 14:09.833
It was my fault.

14:09.900 --> 14:11.666
I killed her
and you never told me--

14:11.733 --> 14:13.900
No, no, sweetheart,
it was an accident.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.733
Oh!

14:18.966 --> 14:20.900
How could I tell you?

14:21.866 --> 14:23.800
'You were just a little girl.'

14:24.700 --> 14:26.533
A beautiful little girl

14:26.600 --> 14:28.633
who had no idea
what she had done.

14:31.300 --> 14:33.233
'I'll share a nightmare
with you.'

14:35.366 --> 14:37.166
The day that it happened, right

14:37.233 --> 14:39.800
I'm going on a business trip.

14:39.866 --> 14:42.266
So I tried to put aside
all the fears

14:42.333 --> 14:45.066
that every father with
a beautiful wife and daughter

14:45.133 --> 14:47.633
has when he has to leave them
for even a second.

14:49.766 --> 14:51.933
I'm at the airport..

14:52.000 --> 14:55.100
...and I get the old
"Ben Collins

14:55.166 --> 14:57.433
white courtesy telephone,
please."

14:58.633 --> 15:00.066
I figured

15:00.133 --> 15:02.800
I forgot my toothbrush
or something, right?

15:04.366 --> 15:05.900
'Not even close.'

15:07.500 --> 15:10.333
More like,
"Excuse me, Mr. Collins.

15:11.566 --> 15:14.200
"This is Dr. Clark.

15:14.266 --> 15:16.233
"Your wife, Emily..

15:17.500 --> 15:21.866
"...has had a freak accident.

15:21.933 --> 15:24.833
And could you please come home?"

15:30.866 --> 15:32.400
I was just trying to protect you

15:32.466 --> 15:34.900
from having to live with that
all your life.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.933
Daddy, I had a right to know.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.633
How didyou find out?

15:45.033 --> 15:46.533
I dreamed it.

15:48.033 --> 15:50.066
You what?

15:52.566 --> 15:54.533
Hi, are you ready for our jog?

16:01.300 --> 16:02.733
Jill..

16:04.700 --> 16:06.466
Amy, I knew about the accident.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.866
I mean, I was the one
that called your father

16:07.933 --> 16:09.366
at the airport.

16:09.433 --> 16:10.633
'But he was only trying
to save you'

16:10.700 --> 16:13.266
'from a lifetime
of unnecessary guilt.'

16:13.333 --> 16:15.033
I dreamed it just the way
it happened then?

16:15.100 --> 16:17.700
Yeah, well, there's no mystery
to that. You were there.

16:17.766 --> 16:20.900
It was a memory that resurfaced
from your subconscious.

16:20.966 --> 16:22.800
'No, I-I'm not buying
that crap, doc.'

16:22.866 --> 16:25.200
'There's more to it
than just remembering.'

16:25.266 --> 16:27.600
Jill is one of the little girls
in the dream.

16:27.666 --> 16:29.233
She's not crippled anymore
because last night

16:29.300 --> 16:32.033
when I dreamed about it,
the car didn't hit her.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.066
Jill's never been a cripple.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.900
Last night I kept
the other little girl

16:35.966 --> 16:37.233
me, from hitting her head.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.500
This morning I woke up
and my scar was gone.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.166
Amy, you've never had a scar.

16:42.233 --> 16:45.100
That's your point of view.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.600
Things are different for me
because I changed them.

16:47.666 --> 16:50.366
Look, Amy, you're letting
this thing get out of control.

16:50.433 --> 16:52.033
No!

16:52.100 --> 16:54.033
It's exactly the opposite.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.033
'I'm incontrol.'

16:58.233 --> 16:59.566
Don't you see?

16:59.633 --> 17:01.766
If I do this right..

17:01.833 --> 17:03.833
...I can bring back my mother.

17:11.366 --> 17:13.000
I'm coming, mommy.

17:14.266 --> 17:16.233
I'll stop the car, I promise.

17:45.866 --> 17:48.300
Little girl! Amy, stop!

18:07.933 --> 18:09.100
Yes?

18:09.166 --> 18:11.100
'Honey, are you alright?'

18:13.000 --> 18:15.166
Who is it?

18:15.233 --> 18:17.200
It's me, silly.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.100
Who'd you expect it to be?

18:22.233 --> 18:23.700
Mother?

18:25.033 --> 18:26.800
Oh, it worked!

18:26.866 --> 18:28.800
It worked.

18:28.866 --> 18:30.200
What worked?

18:30.266 --> 18:32.533
Sweetie, are you okay?

18:32.600 --> 18:33.900
Yes.

18:33.966 --> 18:35.933
I love you, mom.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.700
I love you.

18:40.033 --> 18:42.033
I love you too.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.800
Where's dad?

18:45.766 --> 18:48.266
- What?
- Where's dad?

18:48.333 --> 18:50.300
Is he working late?

18:51.533 --> 18:53.500
Amy, stop it.

18:54.733 --> 18:56.800
Stop what?

18:56.866 --> 18:58.800
Come on. Where is he?

19:02.100 --> 19:05.000
I'm going to make an appointment
with Dr. Clark for you.

19:06.333 --> 19:07.533
Why?

19:08.700 --> 19:11.466
Mother, please. Where's dad?

19:11.533 --> 19:13.433
Why are you doing this?

19:13.500 --> 19:15.833
Your father's dead.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.600
You know that.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.366
No!

19:19.433 --> 19:21.100
Years ago!

19:23.233 --> 19:26.233
It happened the same day
that car almost hit me.

19:28.366 --> 19:31.300
Your father was
on his way to Phoenix.

19:31.366 --> 19:33.300
Just a business trip.

19:35.866 --> 19:38.033
A small plane was off course.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.200
It was a mid-air collision.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.733
No!

19:43.800 --> 19:45.300
Oh, no!

20:04.466 --> 20:07.033
Like mommy and daddy
always say..

20:09.600 --> 20:11.600
...accidents happen.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.200
'Shift commander,
report for debriefing.'

20:30.266 --> 20:32.633
'Shift commander,
report for debriefing.'

20:35.366 --> 20:38.233
'Command unit six, report.'

20:38.300 --> 20:40.233
'Command unit six, report.'

20:44.066 --> 20:46.100
'Level one, electrical
repair crew. Check..'

21:07.400 --> 21:10.166
'...this is battlefield
to command four message.'

21:10.233 --> 21:13.000
- 'Standby to copy.'
- Standby to copy.

21:13.066 --> 21:16.333
'Message follows,
Tango-Foxtrot-Baker-Charlie'

21:16.400 --> 21:20.133
'Alpha-Tango-November
8-3-Oscar-Delta.'

21:23.433 --> 21:25.133
'This is not an exercise.
Repeat.'

21:25.200 --> 21:27.133
'This is not an exercise.'

21:35.933 --> 21:38.233
'Turn key to standby
on my mark.'

21:39.300 --> 21:42.866
'Three, two, one, mark.'

21:42.933 --> 21:46.066
- 'Roger, key to standby.'
- 'Roger, key to standby.'

21:47.366 --> 21:49.300
'And missile enabled.'

21:53.666 --> 21:56.166
- 'Roger, missile enabled.'
- 'Missile enabled.'

21:56.233 --> 21:58.233
'Standby for large countdown.'

21:59.100 --> 22:02.233
'Five, four, three'

22:02.300 --> 22:05.100
'two, one, launch.'

22:35.666 --> 22:38.466
T-F-B-C-A..

22:38.533 --> 22:41.800
'...T-N-3-O-D.'

23:07.366 --> 23:09.733
Today it's Springwood.

23:11.633 --> 23:14.433
Tomorrow the world.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.533
Ka-boom!

23:20.966 --> 23:22.433
Your mother called me
this morning

23:22.500 --> 23:24.866
and said you're not
speaking to her.

23:24.933 --> 23:27.466
- I can't.
- She's very concerned.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.500
She knows something isn't right.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.800
Now..

23:34.000 --> 23:35.933
Are we still having
the nightmares?

23:37.666 --> 23:40.166
Yes, but..

23:40.233 --> 23:41.700
But what?

23:41.766 --> 23:43.733
Come on. Let me help you.

23:44.833 --> 23:46.800
But the nightmares have changed.

23:46.866 --> 23:48.833
Okay, they've changed
in what way?

23:50.700 --> 23:53.033
They're not my dreams anymore.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.300
I don't understand.

23:56.366 --> 23:59.866
I-I'm dreaming about people
and places I've never seen.

23:59.933 --> 24:02.200
I'm dreaming
parts of someone else's life.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.866
Describe them.

24:06.933 --> 24:08.800
Well, in my dream

24:08.866 --> 24:10.600
I-I walk into..

24:10.666 --> 24:13.133
...what looks
like a military base.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.400
Then I go into a control room
filled with equipment.

24:16.466 --> 24:19.033
Suddenly an alarm goes off.
I-it gets all panicky.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.533
When I woke up this morning,
I wrote, I wrote this down.

24:26.633 --> 24:28.633
Amy, this probably
means nothing.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.466
I can't take it anymore.

24:30.533 --> 24:33.500
'I don't know how much longer
I can live like this.'

24:33.566 --> 24:35.133
What's the use?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.866
I'm sorry, doctor.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.433
Amy, wait.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.000
Uh, yes.

24:49.066 --> 24:51.100
Get me Langley, Virginia.

25:16.333 --> 25:17.900
Save us.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.600
Please no more.

25:29.233 --> 25:31.600
'Amy, Amy!'

25:32.933 --> 25:34.400
Yes.

25:34.466 --> 25:37.033
'Honey, there's a man
downstairs to see you.'

25:46.500 --> 25:48.233
Mmm, good!

25:52.600 --> 25:55.466
Oh, I'm, I'm Jack Stears.

25:55.533 --> 25:58.066
I work for the Central
Intelligence Agency.

25:58.133 --> 26:00.933
- Are you Amy Collins?
- Yes.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.133
Well, we have a mutual friend.

26:04.200 --> 26:06.500
'Dr. John Clark.'

26:06.566 --> 26:08.866
'He suggested we have a chat.'

26:08.933 --> 26:11.800
'We'd very much
like to talk to you.'

26:18.433 --> 26:21.133
'Unit command...silo one.'

26:39.033 --> 26:41.300
Hey, uh, Frank,
this is not the kind of jo

26:41.366 --> 26:43.500
you show up late to.

26:46.766 --> 26:49.533
Hey, uh, you don't look so hot.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.933
You okay?

26:54.833 --> 26:56.033
I'm fine.

26:59.233 --> 27:01.933
Just haven't been sleeping
too well lately.

27:25.666 --> 27:27.633
Her name is Amy Collins.

27:27.700 --> 27:30.033
She appears to have
viewing capabilities

27:30.100 --> 27:33.133
that extend beyond her own
sphere of consciousness

27:33.200 --> 27:34.466
to other people.

27:34.533 --> 27:36.833
Now these episodes
only seem to occur

27:36.900 --> 27:39.400
during a sleep like state

27:39.466 --> 27:42.333
and manifests themselves
as dreams.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.466
Her experiences would imply

27:44.533 --> 27:47.200
a possible
national security breach

27:47.266 --> 27:49.066
and that's why
you people are here.

27:49.133 --> 27:51.233
What is your evidence
in this, Stears?

27:51.300 --> 27:53.266
Whatever it is,
it better be good.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.366
We've come a long way.

27:55.433 --> 27:57.733
A couple of days ago,
I got a call

27:57.800 --> 28:01.400
from an old friend mine.
Dr. John Clark.

28:01.466 --> 28:04.900
We worked together on a series
of parapsychological experiments

28:04.966 --> 28:06.566
a few years ago

28:06.633 --> 28:10.333
and he knows of my continuing
interest in these matters.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.333
He made me aware of Amy..

28:13.466 --> 28:14.933
...and this.

28:17.000 --> 28:17.966
What is it?

28:18.033 --> 28:19.666
It's a launch code

28:19.733 --> 28:22.300
for a full-scale
ICBM first strike

28:22.366 --> 28:24.400
against the Soviet Union.

28:24.466 --> 28:26.333
And what's it doing here?

28:26.400 --> 28:28.333
Amy wrote this..

28:28.400 --> 28:30.466
...in her notebook.

28:30.533 --> 28:33.200
She claims it's evidence
obtained in a dream.

28:34.166 --> 28:36.433
You expect us to believe this?

28:36.500 --> 28:38.666
No, no, sir, I don't.

28:38.733 --> 28:41.233
That's why I've spent
the last 48 hours

28:41.300 --> 28:42.700
trying to figure this thing out.

28:42.766 --> 28:44.766
We've investigated
every possible link

28:44.833 --> 28:46.700
between the girl and anyone

28:46.766 --> 28:50.600
linked to or working
with the military defense

28:50.666 --> 28:52.300
the intelligence communities

28:52.366 --> 28:54.700
or anyone that work at NORAD

28:54.766 --> 28:56.366
and we got squat.

28:56.433 --> 28:58.066
'So?'

28:58.133 --> 29:02.200
So it's our job
to test the girl's claim.

29:02.266 --> 29:04.700
Naturally the launch code
was changed immediately

29:04.766 --> 29:07.633
when we learned
there's a situation.

29:07.700 --> 29:11.366
Let's see if she can tell us
the new one.

29:11.433 --> 29:14.066
If she knows ours..

29:14.133 --> 29:16.233
...maybe she knows theirs.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.866
Oh, Billy.
Your ride's here.

29:21.933 --> 29:22.966
- Hi, dad.
- Hi.

29:23.033 --> 29:24.500
Stick 'em out.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.133
Frank honey, are you alright?

29:29.633 --> 29:32.733
Yeah, I'm just a little
wiped out lately, that's all.

29:33.866 --> 29:35.200
Come here.

29:57.466 --> 30:00.500
I'm in his house.

30:00.566 --> 30:04.666
Amy, I want you to go
to the other place.

30:04.733 --> 30:06.533
The military place.

30:08.166 --> 30:09.733
He's not there.

30:11.333 --> 30:12.933
He's at home.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.333
He has a wife..

30:17.100 --> 30:19.033
...and a little boy.

30:20.033 --> 30:22.000
Tell us about him.

30:25.300 --> 30:27.233
He's in a uniform.

30:28.966 --> 30:30.933
His name is Frank.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.300
He's gone.

31:10.566 --> 31:12.800
I can't feel him anymore.

31:12.866 --> 31:16.266
This is just a waste
of time, Stears.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.300
Now hold on. Just hold on.

31:19.566 --> 31:22.300
These things don't always happen
when you want them to.

31:24.700 --> 31:27.300
Why do I have to do this?

31:27.366 --> 31:31.133
'Cause we need your help
to avoid a catastrophe, Amy.

31:35.333 --> 31:36.800
Look.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.400
If you help us..

31:41.466 --> 31:43.533
...maybe we can help you, okay?

31:46.166 --> 31:48.100
- Okay.
- 'Good.'

31:49.500 --> 31:52.900
Now...concentrate.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.400
N..

32:08.400 --> 32:09.800
...U..

32:11.666 --> 32:13.533
...C..

32:13.600 --> 32:15.533
...and the L's there.

32:16.666 --> 32:17.933
E..

32:22.500 --> 32:24.800
I'm there..

32:24.866 --> 32:26.800
...in his living room.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.033
Amy..

32:31.500 --> 32:33.133
...concentrate.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.133
- I want you to go to the--
- Wait.

32:36.233 --> 32:38.700
There's something different.

32:38.766 --> 32:40.100
Good.

32:41.300 --> 32:43.233
Tell us all about it.

32:46.466 --> 32:48.233
- Nucu
- No, Billy.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.433
That's pronounced nuclear, okay?

32:52.000 --> 32:53.666
Whatever.

33:16.766 --> 33:18.200
'War!'

33:18.966 --> 33:20.833
'Hey, my teeth.'

33:23.333 --> 33:25.033
Oops.

34:02.966 --> 34:05.700
- What is it?
- My hair.

34:05.766 --> 34:07.733
Nuclear war.

34:09.700 --> 34:11.800
We're just chatting around!

34:11.866 --> 34:13.900
This is "Seance 101" stuff.

34:13.966 --> 34:16.866
Look, I've had
about enough of you.

34:16.933 --> 34:19.500
Let's pretend to be open-minded.

34:19.566 --> 34:21.466
Let's assume for just one minute

34:21.533 --> 34:23.700
that parapsychology is rea

34:23.766 --> 34:26.066
that she can and has interfaced

34:26.133 --> 34:28.666
her dreams with reality.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.366
And the question is

34:30.433 --> 34:34.266
if she can interface
with someone else's dreams

34:34.333 --> 34:36.233
how can we use her?

34:36.300 --> 34:40.333
D-F-N..

34:40.400 --> 34:44.633
...R-T-A..

34:44.700 --> 34:48.533
...T-P-N..

34:48.600 --> 34:50.833
...G-L.

34:52.966 --> 34:54.666
D-F-N?

34:54.733 --> 34:56.966
Another launch code.

34:57.033 --> 34:58.433
Deegan.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.466
Get me NORAD.

35:02.533 --> 35:05.933
That's not a word, dad.
You lose.

35:11.700 --> 35:13.833
How could you do this?

35:16.566 --> 35:18.933
How could you let this happen?

35:19.000 --> 35:21.133
Me? What did I do?

35:21.200 --> 35:24.266
Oh, no! Pokey, save me!

35:24.333 --> 35:26.766
We interrupt this program
to bring you a special report.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.700
The government
has just informed us

35:28.766 --> 35:31.700
that a full-scale
nuclear attack..

35:34.400 --> 35:36.400
Cable's out again.

35:39.666 --> 35:41.966
I didn't mean to do it.
I'm sorry!

35:42.033 --> 35:44.033
- 'Did something happen, honey?'
- God!

35:46.600 --> 35:48.533
'What'd you say, Frank?'

35:49.566 --> 35:51.800
Uh, nothin'.

35:51.866 --> 35:53.833
I must have dozed off.

35:55.033 --> 35:57.533
Uh, I'll see you tonight, honey.

35:57.600 --> 36:00.066
'Okay, have a good day at work.'

36:00.133 --> 36:02.033
Foxtrot, Lima.

36:02.100 --> 36:04.033
'She's coming out of it.'

36:04.900 --> 36:07.233
'What happened?'

36:07.300 --> 36:09.500
Frank's gone to work.

36:09.566 --> 36:12.133
You have to stop him
before he dreams again.

36:12.200 --> 36:15.933
Seems she dreamed of Uncle Sam's
new preemptive strike code.

36:17.800 --> 36:22.333
Amy, tell me exactly
what did you see?

36:29.933 --> 36:31.900
I saw the end of the world.

36:47.066 --> 36:49.633
So do you have money
on the game last night?

36:49.700 --> 36:51.366
- What?
- The game, man.

36:51.433 --> 36:54.066
- Did you see it?
- Oh, uh, game.

36:54.133 --> 36:55.200
No, I must have missed it.

36:55.266 --> 36:57.533
'Oh, you're lucky.
I lost a bundle.'

37:09.800 --> 37:11.866
Right.

37:11.933 --> 37:15.233
We ran through the Pentagon
database as well as NORAD.

37:15.300 --> 37:17.733
And what we got
out of 26 ICBM sites

37:17.800 --> 37:20.600
in the Continental US
with man named Frank

37:20.666 --> 37:24.033
who are married with one son
and are on duty as we speak.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.833
Wow, that narrows it down,
doesn't it?

37:28.000 --> 37:31.033
Amy, where are you now?

37:32.800 --> 37:34.966
'The military place.'

37:35.033 --> 37:37.300
What are you..

37:37.366 --> 37:39.700
What's he doing now?

37:39.766 --> 37:42.200
Sleeping.

37:42.266 --> 37:43.633
And I'm with him.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.400
What does she mean?

37:45.500 --> 37:47.100
Amy.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.800
Tell me everything..

37:51.866 --> 37:53.633
'...that's happening.'

38:38.800 --> 38:41.233
- Oh, no!
- 'What?'

38:41.300 --> 38:43.333
Listen to me, Stears.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.666
We need to find
the exact reference point

38:46.733 --> 38:49.566
that this experience
is coming from.

38:49.633 --> 38:51.633
How do you mean?

38:51.700 --> 38:55.666
Is this just
a shared nightmare

38:55.733 --> 38:58.033
or is it really happening?

38:59.100 --> 39:01.566
Tell me, Amy.

39:01.633 --> 39:04.566
'Is this in the past
or in the future or what?'

39:04.633 --> 39:06.533
It's today.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.866
Now.

39:07.933 --> 39:10.366
Then we've&lt;TO

39:10.433 --> 39:12.600
this silo immediately.

39:12.666 --> 39:14.566
Are you sure we shouldn't
jack around some more?

39:14.633 --> 39:16.266
I know.

39:16.333 --> 39:17.466
Tell her to look to the right

39:17.533 --> 39:19.600
of the eight
missile enable switches.

39:19.666 --> 39:21.766
There should be a number
printed against the wall.

39:21.833 --> 39:25.033
5-8-6-2-2-3.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.800
I'll get back on with NORAD.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.166
She's getting better at this.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.600
No! Don't!

39:52.666 --> 39:54.466
What's going on?

39:54.533 --> 39:56.033
'He just hit the other man.'

39:56.100 --> 39:58.200
Terrific.

39:58.266 --> 40:00.866
Now he-he's typing something
into the computer.

40:00.933 --> 40:02.600
'Typing what?'

40:03.733 --> 40:04.800
I don't know.

40:04.866 --> 40:06.833
'Okay, we got a silo.'

40:06.900 --> 40:09.233
Section 2310, Nebraska.

40:09.300 --> 40:10.966
And wait..

40:11.033 --> 40:12.533
What?

40:14.433 --> 40:16.933
That silo has just gone
into complete communications

40:17.000 --> 40:19.600
and intervention shutdown.

40:19.666 --> 40:21.200
Yeah, go on.

40:24.700 --> 40:28.033
Our friend Frank has just
changed his missile's target.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.200
To where?

40:31.266 --> 40:33.200
To right where we are standing.

41:06.733 --> 41:09.266
No, no, no,
just-just wait a minute here.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.766
There's really no way
that he can launch a missile

41:11.833 --> 41:13.833
especially
on a US target, right?

41:13.900 --> 41:16.266
No, he can't do it himself

41:16.333 --> 41:19.100
He and his partner have to turn
the key simultaneously.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.300
Instead of that, we just keep

41:20.366 --> 41:21.700
that kind of thing
from happening.

41:21.766 --> 41:24.800
The launch silo's
designed to be impenetrable.

41:24.866 --> 41:27.033
Well, our boys know
how the mechanisms work.

41:27.100 --> 41:28.600
Five minutes and they'll be in.

41:28.666 --> 41:29.933
We'll be in control.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.133
This system works.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.233
Oh, really?

41:33.300 --> 41:35.566
Well, will you explain
to me, colonel

41:35.633 --> 41:37.633
how a sleepwalking whacko
wound up

41:37.700 --> 41:40.133
with his trigger finger
on the big banana?

41:47.733 --> 41:49.966
Prepare to enable missiles,
Neil.

41:50.033 --> 41:52.433
Frank, what's going on?
Why are you doing this?

41:54.366 --> 41:57.100
Get ready to turn your keys
standby on my mark.

41:58.133 --> 41:59.133
Listen to me.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.933
Come on, Neil.
Let's go to standby.

42:07.866 --> 42:10.100
On my mark.

42:10.166 --> 42:14.000
Three, two, one, mark.

42:22.033 --> 42:24.866
Begin enabling missiles...now.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.500
Frank.

42:26.566 --> 42:29.033
I will blow
your brains out, Neil!

42:30.066 --> 42:31.400
What's happening?

42:31.466 --> 42:33.400
He's flipping a row of switches.

42:33.466 --> 42:35.133
Enabling missiles.

42:39.366 --> 42:40.400
It's all over.

42:47.800 --> 42:49.133
Prepare to launch.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.133
On my mark, Neil.

42:51.200 --> 42:53.533
No! Please!

42:55.300 --> 42:58.066
Ten, nine..

42:58.133 --> 43:00.700
Frank, Frank,
think of the people.

43:00.766 --> 43:03.166
...eight, seven..

43:03.233 --> 43:04.733
We're gonna start a war!

43:04.800 --> 43:07.666
...six, five..

43:07.733 --> 43:09.133
Stop him!

43:09.200 --> 43:10.433
...four..

43:11.966 --> 43:13.800
'...three..'

43:15.166 --> 43:17.066
...two..

43:17.133 --> 43:18.866
Go ahead, Frank!

43:18.933 --> 43:20.066
Go ahead!

43:40.200 --> 43:41.966
'Okay, that's it.'

43:42.033 --> 43:44.300
'We just got an all clear.'

43:44.366 --> 43:45.933
No!

43:58.500 --> 44:00.233
He's dead.

44:02.133 --> 44:05.133
He's dead
and it wasn't his fault.

44:05.200 --> 44:07.766
'It wasn't?'

44:07.833 --> 44:09.800
It was the nightmares.

44:11.466 --> 44:14.300
'You've done well.'

44:14.366 --> 44:18.400
Now I want you to just relax
and get a good night's sleep.

44:19.866 --> 44:22.033
Then we can start
all over again tomorrow.

44:24.266 --> 44:26.233
Again?

44:26.300 --> 44:29.633
Just put it out
of your mind for right now.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.766
We've got a couple
of other things

44:31.833 --> 44:33.800
we'd like you to look into.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.133
No!

44:49.200 --> 44:53.700
I'd rather get you
little buckaroos one at a time.

44:53.766 --> 44:55.700
Hee-haw!

44:55.766 --> 44:58.000
Hee-haw!

44:58.066 --> 45:00.333
Nuke 'em, cowboy!
