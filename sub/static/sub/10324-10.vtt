Mornin', Earl.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.673
Mornin', Randy.

00:08.775 --> 00:11.676
You know what team
I've always wanted to join?

00:11.778 --> 00:13.678
The debate team.

00:13.780 --> 00:16.681
- No, you haven't.
- Yes, I have.

00:16.783 --> 00:20.446
Well, no offense, but I don't think
you'd be very good at that.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.783
Yes, I would.

00:22.889 --> 00:25.289
You know, Randy,
I think debatin' is more than just sayin'...

00:25.392 --> 00:27.383
the opposite of what
the other person says.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.860
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.453
- No, it isn't.
- It is.
- Isn't.

00:31.564 --> 00:35.022
Randy, this is stupid.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.409
I win.

00:43.510 --> 00:46.070
<i>My name is Earl.</i>

00:49.649 --> 00:51.640
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>There were a few things on my list...</i>

00:51.751 --> 00:53.651
<i>that I'd actually done to the Crab Shack.</i>

00:53.753 --> 00:56.051
<i>One of'em, people had gotten</i>
<i>used to working around.</i>

00:56.156 --> 00:58.090
Beer comin'!

01:02.162 --> 01:05.563
<i>But it was still somethin'</i>
<i>I wanted to fix.</i>

01:05.665 --> 01:08.225
- I'm fixing the dent, Darnell.
- <i>That's good to hear.</i>

01:08.334 --> 01:10.802
I tried to build a ramp over it
with disastrous results.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.804
Why would you slide it to me?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.396
Who slides wine?

01:14.507 --> 01:17.067
<i>[Earl Narrating] There was a reason</i>
<i>why I was fixing this today-</i>

01:17.177 --> 01:19.338
<i>'cause it was the anniversary</i>
<i>of the day I dented it...</i>

01:19.446 --> 01:22.279
<i>which was also the anniversary</i>
<i>of the day I married Joy.</i>

01:22.382 --> 01:25.783
<i>Joy's situation forced her</i>
<i>to be a new wife and mother all at once.</i>

01:25.885 --> 01:31.187
Ow! Damn it, baby. You keep kicking my kidney,
and I'ma hold my breath again.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.726
[Groans]

01:34.828 --> 01:37.126
All right. You asked for it.

01:38.731 --> 01:41.495
- What's your name again?
- Joy.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.535
- You got a baby in there?
- Yup.

01:43.636 --> 01:45.501
Is that my brother's baby?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.573
It is now.

01:50.643 --> 01:52.543
Mrs. Hickey?

01:52.645 --> 01:55.113
I believe you requested
I steal one of these.

01:55.215 --> 01:57.479
Oh, Earl, you did it!

01:57.584 --> 02:01.020
I knew we were meant for each other
the first time I met you the other night.

02:01.121 --> 02:04.488
- Where'd you get it?
- You walk into a bakery wearing a hairnet...

02:04.591 --> 02:06.957
you can walk out
with pretty much anything you want.

02:07.060 --> 02:10.860
- Randy, I got you a bag of sprinkles.
- Shut up!

02:10.964 --> 02:12.659
<i>[Joy]</i>
<i>This thing's goin'in the freezer.</i>

02:12.765 --> 02:15.734
They say if you eat it on the one-year
anniversary, you'll have good luck.

02:15.835 --> 02:18.861
<i>Saw it on</i> Oprah.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.805
<i>She don't know much about marriage,</i>
<i>but she sure knows somethin'about cake.</i>

02:21.908 --> 02:24.308
<i>[Earl Narrating] That first year</i>
<i>didn't go the wayJoy had hoped...</i>

02:24.410 --> 02:27.504
<i>and a few days before our anniversary,</i>
<i>she hit rock bottom.</i>

02:27.614 --> 02:30.811
- Our belly button fuzz balls
are about the same size.
- <i>[Baby Crying]</i>

02:30.917 --> 02:33.044
How do we pick a winner?

02:33.153 --> 02:36.316
That's it. I can't wait till Wednesday
to eat that cake.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.549
I need my luck now.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.025
Is that skin or a piece
of Frosted Flake in yours?

02:44.931 --> 02:46.831
Skin.

02:46.933 --> 02:50.232
What the hell? Somebody switched my cake
with a pile of dog turds.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.531
Either one of you
know anything about this?

02:52.639 --> 02:57.008
Actually, they're cat turds.
But I don't know anything about it.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.011
<i>[Earl Narrating] A couple days</i>
<i>after I stole that cake...</i>

03:00.113 --> 03:02.946

<i>at the Crab Shack.</i>

03:03.049 --> 03:07.110

<i>You better not be</i>
<i>gettin'into my food in the fridge!</i>

03:14.594 --> 03:19.793
- Yeah, I hate you too, you bitchy old screech owl.
- <i>[Cat Meows]</i>

03:19.899 --> 03:23.096
<i>[Earl Narrating] Randy knew he couldn't</i>
<i>just put empty foil back in the freezer...</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:26.969

- <i>eatJoy's cake and feed her poo.</i>
- [Meows]

03:29.542 --> 03:32.943
- [Both Laughing]
- You think this is funny?

03:33.046 --> 03:35.412
Why are you gettin' so mad
over a little thing like this?

03:35.515 --> 03:38.143
<i>So my brother replaced</i>
<i>our wedding cake with cat poo.</i>

03:38.251 --> 03:40.151
I'm sure it happens
in a lot of marriages.

03:40.253 --> 03:42.778
It's not a "little" thing.
That cake was a symbol.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.153
- Of what?
- I don't know!

03:45.258 --> 03:47.783
Somethin'- like,
that you cared about me.

03:47.894 --> 03:51.421
And then dummy ruins it

04:04.210 --> 04:06.576
So we agree.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.680
<i>[Earl Narrating]</i>
<i>Randy felt guilty for days...</i>

04:10.783 --> 04:15.117
<i>so on our actual anniversary,</i>

04:16.656 --> 04:18.556
"Dear Earl and Joy...

04:18.658 --> 04:20.558
"I'm sorry for eatin' your cake...

"so I'm gonna kill myself

"I'll probably shoot myself in the face.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.804
<i>[Crowd]</i>
<i>Surprise!</i>

04:33.906 --> 04:36.966
- Happy anniversary!
- Oh, my God.

04:37.076 --> 04:39.601
<i>Oh, my God, Randy.</i>
<i>Did you do all this?</i>

04:39.712 --> 04:42.408
Are you kiddin' me?
Earl's been plannin' this for weeks.

04:42.515 --> 04:46.474
Why do you think he's been such a jerk lately?
He was just setting you up for this.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.850
You did this?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.855
Yeah!

04:50.957 --> 04:53.016
I did this.
Me.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.289
Thanks, Earl.
I really needed a lift right now.

04:56.396 --> 04:59.991
Thought I might get it by Randy killin' himself,
but this is even better.

05:03.269 --> 05:06.898
Thanks, Randy.
You made life better for both of us.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.531
You're welcome, Earl.
I felt bad.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.304
When this marriage ends,
I want it to be...

05:12.412 --> 05:15.176
because you and Joy hate each other,
not because of me.

05:15.281 --> 05:18.079
- Hey, Joy.
- [Jukebox] #What's your name #

05:18.184 --> 05:22.052
Well, it's been fun chattin'. You wanna get outta
here and go have sex? 'Cause I do, real bad.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.488
No, Donny. Quit starin' at me
with your crazy eyes.

05:25.591 --> 05:28.992
I'll put a bag over my head
like you made me do last time we banged.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.892
Look, the only reason
you got lucky that night...

05:30.997 --> 05:32.897
was 'cause I had cramps
and sometimes that helps.

05:32.999 --> 05:38.596
And no hard feelings, but when you're naked
you look like you got kneecaps everywhere.

05:40.206 --> 05:42.106
Hello, Joy.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.769
Oh, my God!
[Laughs] Mr. Stevens!

05:45.878 --> 05:48.278
I haven't seen you
since Missy's wedding.

05:48.381 --> 05:51.373
- What's that, like, five years ago?
- Seven.

05:51.484 --> 05:54.351
And aside from my daughter,
you were the most beautiful girl there.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.287
Oh, you are so sweet!

05:57.390 --> 06:00.587
You didn't tell anybody that we, uh,
slept together that night, did you?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.923
Hell, no.
I wasn't in a rush to tell my friends...

06:03.029 --> 06:05.259
about humpin' someone's
red-faced, bald-headed, out-of-bread dad...

06:05.365 --> 06:07.265

- Hey, babe.
- <i># Shootin'you straight #</i>

06:22.648 --> 06:26.778
Earl, who-who exactly
did you invite to this party?

06:26.886 --> 06:30.413
Uh- R-R-Randy was more in charge
of the guest list.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.286
Who'd we invite?

06:32.392 --> 06:35.953
People me and you know,
plus all ofJoy's friends.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.962
You know,
from her address book.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.191
"Guys I've phoned."

06:41.434 --> 06:43.994
Randy, it says
"Guys I've boned."

06:44.103 --> 06:47.004
That's a "B"?
I thought it was an "F."

06:47.106 --> 06:49.336
- How could you let this happen?
- I didn't let this happen.

06:49.442 --> 06:51.433
I didn't have anything to do
with this stupid party.

06:52.578 --> 06:55.911
No, wait. Yes, I did.
L-I did everything.

06:56.015 --> 06:59.178
No, l-l-I did nothin'.
What are you more mad about?

06:59.285 --> 07:01.685
You didn't throw this party.
Dummy did.

07:01.788 --> 07:05.121
I know, I know. I'm a terrible husband
who never blah, blah, blah!

07:05.224 --> 07:07.124
But you're no prize either.

07:07.226 --> 07:10.354
What kind of wife keeps an address book
full of guys she banged?

07:10.463 --> 07:13.091
The kind of wife that wants to keep
her options open for the future.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.861
What? You think you're gonna find
someone better than me?

07:15.968 --> 07:19.199
Go for it, baby,
but keep in mind this is Camden.

07:19.305 --> 07:22.763
I own my own car,
I almost graduated high school...

07:22.875 --> 07:25.708
