00:19.990 --> 00:21.192
<i>Previously on</i> Titans...

00:21.193 --> 00:23.027
<i>Something's
happening to me.</i>

00:23.059 --> 00:24.762
<i>When I fought my father,</i>

00:24.763 --> 00:26.763
<i>I became something.</i>

00:26.797 --> 00:28.265
<i>Something different.</i>

00:30.134 --> 00:31.769
Rach.

00:31.803 --> 00:33.337
<i>What are you doing,
coming back here?</i>

00:33.338 --> 00:34.736
That was a long time ago.

00:34.737 --> 00:35.798
You made them Titans.

00:35.799 --> 00:37.640
<i>Do they even know
what happened last time?</i>

00:38.277 --> 00:39.277
Garth!

00:39.310 --> 00:40.377
<i>His name is Deathstroke.</i>

00:40.378 --> 00:41.477
<i>Old Titans business.</i>

00:41.478 --> 00:42.880
<i>Former Delta Force
commando.</i>

00:42.881 --> 00:46.551
"Who underwent a series of
experimental bio-enhancements."

00:46.584 --> 00:47.750
- I thought he...
- He was dead.

00:47.752 --> 00:48.719
Yeah, we all did.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.419
But he's alive and well
in San Francisco.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.756
<i>You have Slade Wilson's
daughter in the other room?</i>

00:52.789 --> 00:54.024
She can't stay here.

00:54.026 --> 00:55.026
But I can't kick her out.

00:55.027 --> 00:56.604
Slade's tried to kill her once,
he'll do it again.

00:56.628 --> 00:57.794
So how'd you
find me anyway?

00:57.795 --> 00:58.795
The tracker.

00:58.796 --> 00:59.864
<i>He did it for you.</i>

00:59.865 --> 01:01.866
In case anything ever happened,
<i>he could find us.</i>

01:01.899 --> 01:04.233
<i>Dr. Light's out of prison.
Someone broke him out.</i>

01:04.236 --> 01:06.203
<i>There's been a trail of
dead bodies ever since.</i>

01:06.236 --> 01:08.638
Quick look,
then we call Dick.

01:08.671 --> 01:09.840
I promise.

02:16.907 --> 02:19.475
Ah, Dr. Light.

02:21.545 --> 02:22.947
Did you come up with
that shit by yourself,

02:22.948 --> 02:25.116
or did your parents
saddle you with that bullshit?

02:25.149 --> 02:26.383
I mean, come on.

02:26.417 --> 02:28.085
What a lame fucking name.

02:28.118 --> 02:29.252
Shut it.

02:29.287 --> 02:30.320
What?

02:30.322 --> 02:32.289
Is my talking annoying you,
dickweed?

02:33.890 --> 02:35.859
'Cause that's the thing.

02:35.893 --> 02:38.027
I can do it all day.

02:38.062 --> 02:39.862
All night.

02:39.896 --> 02:42.467
And if you're nice,

02:42.500 --> 02:45.002
twice on a Sunday.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.270
I said shut the fuck up.

02:46.304 --> 02:47.871
Aah! Aah!

03:02.051 --> 03:06.889
Night night, asshole.

03:20.837 --> 03:23.237
Leaving so soon?

03:55.306 --> 03:57.542
Call Rachel.

03:57.574 --> 04:02.574
Calling Rachel.

04:16.994 --> 04:17.994
Rach?

04:24.235 --> 04:25.285
Rachel?

04:33.944 --> 04:35.079
Aah!

04:35.112 --> 04:37.380
I'm up, I'm up.

04:37.415 --> 04:40.884
Gar.

04:40.918 --> 04:43.853
What happened?

04:43.887 --> 04:46.423
Shit.

04:46.456 --> 04:48.259
I'm so sorry.

04:48.291 --> 04:52.362
- Please don't tell Dick.
- Jason's...

04:52.396 --> 04:54.230
gone.

04:54.264 --> 04:55.533
What?

04:55.565 --> 04:58.937
What happened to Jason?

04:58.970 --> 05:03.274
We figured out that Dr.
Light was in the train tunnels.

05:05.976 --> 05:10.146
Jason wanted to prove to you
that he wasn't a reject.

05:10.180 --> 05:11.915
We were gonna come right back.

05:11.949 --> 05:15.752
And then,
Jason wanted to split up.

05:15.786 --> 05:18.288
And then I heard him scream,
and I ran,

05:18.322 --> 05:19.456
but they were already gone.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.826
Why did you go out there
in the first place?

05:21.860 --> 05:24.427
On your own,
with no weapons, no backup.

05:24.461 --> 05:26.762
- I'm sorry.
- I just need details.

05:26.797 --> 05:28.632
Specifics.

05:28.665 --> 05:31.702
Just write down
everything you remember.

05:31.735 --> 05:34.038
I'm searching for his tracker
right now.

05:38.074 --> 05:41.079
<i>Subject offline.</i>

05:41.112 --> 05:45.516
If Jason's still down there,
all that concrete and stone,

05:45.550 --> 05:50.550
it would mask the GPS signal
from the satellite.

05:52.355 --> 05:54.925
Yes. It would.

05:59.997 --> 06:01.733
Jason's strong.
He'll fight back.

06:01.766 --> 06:03.434
Yeah?
Or he'll be so annoying

06:03.466 --> 06:05.002
that Dr. Light
will just let him go

06:05.036 --> 06:08.139
'cause he doesn't
want to hear him talk.

06:08.173 --> 06:10.240
We should be out there
helping to bring him back.

06:10.274 --> 06:11.475
We are helping.

06:11.509 --> 06:14.110
No, we're not.
We're watching coffee drip.

06:14.144 --> 06:15.379
Brew.

06:15.413 --> 06:17.682
They don't trust us.

06:17.714 --> 06:18.882
They've been acting strange

06:18.916 --> 06:20.883
even before Jason went missing.

06:20.884 --> 06:22.484
- Hmm.
- Closed door meetings,

06:22.485 --> 06:23.698
keeping secrets.

06:23.699 --> 06:26.357
Did you notice how they're barely
even talking to each other?

06:26.389 --> 06:28.124
Something is off.

06:28.125 --> 06:29.694
I can feel it.

06:29.726 --> 06:30.994
Can't you do that thing

06:30.995 --> 06:33.229
where you touch them
and find out what's going on?

06:33.230 --> 06:35.632
I'm not a magic 8-ball.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.367
- Sorry.
- Besides,

06:37.369 --> 06:40.971
ever since my father
gave me this...

06:41.004 --> 06:42.572
beauty,

06:42.607 --> 06:45.776
my powers have been
somewhat different.

06:45.810 --> 06:48.112
So, we just have to trust
the team's gonna bring him back

06:48.144 --> 06:50.648
the old-fashioned way.

06:50.682 --> 06:54.250
How very retro.

06:55.418 --> 06:57.355
Why did they go after Dr. Light

06:57.387 --> 07:00.156
by themselves
in the first place?

07:00.190 --> 07:01.625
I don't know.

07:01.658 --> 07:04.127
He's been complaining
about being left out lately.

07:04.161 --> 07:05.396
Oh, don't blame yourself.

07:05.428 --> 07:06.997
Shit-stirrer did this
on his own.

07:07.031 --> 07:09.533
There must be 20 or 30
miles of tunnel down there.

07:09.567 --> 07:10.734
Maybe more.

07:10.735 --> 07:12.335
We can't cover
all this ground in one night.

07:12.336 --> 07:14.470
Which is why I've redirected
the satellites to the area

07:14.471 --> 07:15.839
to sweep for Jason's tracker.

07:15.874 --> 07:18.509
Hopefully we can pinpoint
his exact location from there.

07:18.543 --> 07:21.745
Gar and Rachel
will monitor it from here.

07:21.778 --> 07:24.822
Boy-fucking-wonder
strikes again.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.684
Keep your heads
on a swivel guys,

07:27.685 --> 07:30.221
Dr. Light could
still be down here.

07:30.254 --> 07:34.391
<i>Dick, no sign of
Jason's tracker on the 3rd floor.</i>

07:34.425 --> 07:36.427
Hank, did you find anything?

07:36.459 --> 07:39.697
Do rats the size
of my head count?

07:39.730 --> 07:41.233
Stay positive, Hank.

07:41.266 --> 07:43.567
I got dragged out of bed
to trudge through sewer water

07:43.600 --> 07:45.903
'cause dip-shit decided
to go off half-cocked.

07:45.937 --> 07:48.203
At least Jason found Dr. Light.

07:48.204 --> 07:49.306
<i>Maybe he would have told us</i>

07:49.307 --> 07:52.108
<i>if we'd given him
half the chance yesterday.</i>

08:00.216 --> 08:01.718
Guys, I got something.

08:01.752 --> 08:06.489
<i>Sending over
the coordinates now.</i>

08:06.490 --> 08:07.490
Jesus.

08:07.491 --> 08:11.696
This is fucked.

08:11.728 --> 08:13.996
He was attacked here.

08:13.997 --> 08:14.932
Then dragged.

08:14.933 --> 08:17.233
Tracks disappear
a hundred yards down.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.502
He could be anywhere.

08:18.536 --> 08:19.603
If he's still alive.

08:19.637 --> 08:20.838
He's alive.

08:20.872 --> 08:22.739
Dr. Light's using him
as bait to lure us out.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.275
If he was dead,
he would have left him here.

08:24.276 --> 08:25.674
How does that
make it any better?

08:25.675 --> 08:27.008
I'm not saying
it makes it better.

08:27.009 --> 08:28.345
Back up.

08:28.379 --> 08:30.112
So the kid is bait to you now?

08:30.113 --> 08:31.114
Is that right?

08:31.115 --> 08:32.049
That's rich, Dick.

08:32.049 --> 08:33.383
You were bagging on him
a minute ago,

08:33.384 --> 08:34.484
and now he's your best friend?

08:34.485 --> 08:35.753
Not about me, pal.

08:35.787 --> 08:37.253
This is all because of you

08:37.254 --> 08:40.057
and your big, dumb fuckin' idea
to start up the Titans again!

08:40.091 --> 08:42.493
- I'm out.
- Yep, me too.

08:42.525 --> 08:45.028
What? Where are you going?

08:45.062 --> 08:46.663
To get Jason.

08:46.697 --> 08:48.599
And for the record,
this is all of our faults.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.366
Every single one of us.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.636
So get over it and move on.

08:52.669 --> 08:56.206
<i>Jason's out there,
and we're wasting time.</i>

08:56.240 --> 08:58.485
<i>Well, we can't keep
wandering the tunnels all night</i>

08:58.509 --> 09:00.510
<i>looking for this
tracking signal.</i>

09:00.543 --> 09:01.846
<i>We need a new plan.</i>

09:01.879 --> 09:06.879
This little asshole
has a tracking device in him?

09:10.553 --> 09:12.523
Dick?

09:12.556 --> 09:14.206
What is it?

09:18.428 --> 09:20.431
No, no, no, no, no.

09:20.464 --> 09:23.668
The motherfucker found it!

09:23.701 --> 09:25.503
Why are you sitting there

09:25.535 --> 09:27.205
like a damn statue

09:27.238 --> 09:29.974
when our whole fuckin' plan
is going up in smoke?

09:30.008 --> 09:31.274
This is good.

09:31.307 --> 09:32.543
Oh, yeah. Good.

09:32.576 --> 09:34.812
What exactly is good about

09:34.846 --> 09:38.414
four months of planning
going down the fucking drain?

09:38.448 --> 09:39.549
When you broke me out,

09:39.582 --> 09:41.251
you told me
we would kill these bastards

09:41.285 --> 09:43.955
as long as I herded them
to San Francisco!

09:43.988 --> 09:46.691
And now you just let our best
chance of killing these masks

09:46.692 --> 09:48.057
slip through our fingers.

09:48.091 --> 09:49.461
And for what?

09:49.494 --> 09:54.494
For a reason you may
not be capable of understanding.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.368
You know, ever since
you found out

09:56.400 --> 09:58.969
that your daughter
is running with the Titans,

09:58.970 --> 10:00.404
you're losing focus.

10:00.438 --> 10:02.482
I'm beginning to wonder just how
different you are from them.

10:02.506 --> 10:05.208
With this ridiculous costume,
swinging your sword around,

10:05.241 --> 10:07.043
nothing gets done.

10:07.044 --> 10:08.644
If you're
looking for a result,

10:08.645 --> 10:11.448
I'm happy to
provide you with one.

10:14.885 --> 10:16.253
Ah, fuck it. We're clean.

10:16.287 --> 10:17.754
I don't owe you shit.

10:17.788 --> 10:19.389
I'll take care
of the Titans myself.

10:19.423 --> 10:24.423
<i>Adi-</i> fucking <i>-os, amigo.</i>

11:06.803 --> 11:11.803
It is you they're looking for.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.383
But it is he they shall find.

11:19.416 --> 11:21.451
Oh, fuck!

11:23.052 --> 11:24.052
Shit!

11:42.438 --> 11:47.344
Yeah.

12:13.604 --> 12:16.453
Damn.

12:21.879 --> 12:23.113
Any luck
finding your boy?

12:23.114 --> 12:25.115
Dick and the team
are still searching.

12:25.149 --> 12:26.650
They're probably
in the tunnels.

12:26.684 --> 12:30.087
Do you guys have any cereal
not made for old people?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.956
I mean, who eats
Wheaty Bits anyways?

12:31.989 --> 12:34.457
- I can't believe you.
- What?

12:34.490 --> 12:35.593
You don't even care.

12:35.594 --> 12:37.760
I got ripped from my sleep
in the middle of the night.

12:37.761 --> 12:39.697
Excuse me if I wanted
a midnight snack.

12:39.730 --> 12:44.601
Jason could be getting burned
to a crisp right now.

12:44.634 --> 12:47.302
You could at least
try to help.

12:47.303 --> 12:48.303
How?

12:48.304 --> 12:49.373
By hanging out with you
and your girlfriend

12:49.374 --> 12:51.741
in front of a computer?

12:51.775 --> 12:52.917
She's not my girlfriend.

12:52.918 --> 12:54.888
So, are you saying you don't like
her or she doesn't like you?

12:54.912 --> 12:56.012
No. No.

12:56.013 --> 12:58.014
I'm not having
this conversation.

12:58.048 --> 12:59.750
Enjoy your cereal.

12:59.783 --> 13:00.918
Listen.

13:00.951 --> 13:03.620
I'm sorry Robin 2.0 is missing
or whatever.

13:03.653 --> 13:05.889
But he did this to himself.

13:05.923 --> 13:09.126
So don't project your guilt
on me, tiger boy.

13:09.159 --> 13:10.595
Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:10.629 --> 13:14.928
I'm about to go ham on some
Cinnamon Corn Puffs and chill.

13:26.376 --> 13:27.912
No coffee?

13:27.945 --> 13:30.514
- What's wrong?
- Rose.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.816
Kitchen. Eating.

13:31.849 --> 13:32.850
Just let her.

13:32.884 --> 13:36.586
She doesn't even know him.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.190
Besides, it wasn't her fault.

13:39.224 --> 13:40.690
You're saying it's mine?

13:40.691 --> 13:41.692
I didn't say that.

13:41.725 --> 13:43.793
Then what's the face for?

13:43.827 --> 13:45.929
It's nothing.

13:45.962 --> 13:48.932
What?

13:48.966 --> 13:50.467
I understand.

13:50.501 --> 13:53.171
Why you didn't tell Dick
about your little plan.

13:53.203 --> 13:54.437
You could've come to me.

13:54.438 --> 13:56.408
I could've helped
if you didn't keep it a secret.

13:56.441 --> 13:59.543
How? You can't
even control yourself.

13:59.576 --> 14:00.778
Excuse me?

14:00.812 --> 14:03.214
Yeah, I saw you yesterday
in the training room.

14:03.248 --> 14:04.750
You couldn't bring it back in.

14:04.783 --> 14:07.985
Not to mention your creepy
black cloud of razor blades

14:08.019 --> 14:10.221
that nearly took my hand off.

14:10.254 --> 14:12.332
At least now I know how you
got those marks on your back.

14:12.356 --> 14:13.758
Oh, so you're spying on me now?

14:13.791 --> 14:15.960
I'm not spying on you.

14:15.993 --> 14:17.961
I saw it
when we were sparring.

14:17.995 --> 14:20.965
Don't come at me
about keeping secrets.

14:20.998 --> 14:24.369
First of all,
my powers are fine.

14:24.402 --> 14:27.572
If I'd been there, I could've turned
the guy into a glowing puddle.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.439
What did you do, Gar?
Did you growl at him?

14:29.440 --> 14:30.808
Was he real scared?

14:30.841 --> 14:32.975
If you and Jason hadn't been so
stupid and thought it through,

14:32.976 --> 14:33.945
none of this
would have happened!

14:33.946 --> 14:36.413
Screw you!

14:36.447 --> 14:38.749
<i>Security alert,
main entrance.</i>

14:38.783 --> 14:43.086
<i>Access denied.</i>

14:43.120 --> 14:45.889
<i>Hello? Is anyone home?</i>

14:45.923 --> 14:48.173
Perfect timing.

14:52.763 --> 14:55.499
Rachel, I'm sorry.

14:56.767 --> 14:59.769
<i>Alert, tracker located.</i>

14:59.803 --> 15:01.172
I got something.

15:01.205 --> 15:04.774
He's not moving.

15:04.808 --> 15:06.811
It's fucking Dr. Light.

15:06.844 --> 15:09.947
What the fuck?

15:09.980 --> 15:13.083
Is that Jason's tracker?

15:13.116 --> 15:15.285
Someone must have
cut it out of him.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.787
Well, if Dr. Light's dead,
where the fuck is Jason?

15:18.788 --> 15:20.123
He must be working
with a partner.

15:32.604 --> 15:35.105
I see you found my gift.

15:35.139 --> 15:36.573
It's Deathstroke.

15:36.607 --> 15:38.942
- Where's Jason?
- Oh.

15:38.975 --> 15:40.278
You mean your little sidekick?

15:40.311 --> 15:42.378
Who the fuck you calling
a sidekick, asshole?

15:42.379 --> 15:43.379
Attaboy.

15:43.413 --> 15:44.783
Fuck! Fuck!

15:44.816 --> 15:48.186
You fucking bastard!
Come try that shit with me!

15:48.219 --> 15:49.653
Just tell us what you want.

15:51.221 --> 15:52.789
As I was saying,

15:52.822 --> 15:54.824
if you want him back,

15:54.825 --> 15:57.075
hand over Rose.

16:00.498 --> 16:02.832
And how do we know
you're gonna keep your promise?

16:07.971 --> 16:09.940
<i>Tonight, 3:00 AM,</i>

16:09.974 --> 16:11.708
<i>Embarcadero Plaza.</i>

16:11.741 --> 16:13.009
<i>Outside.</i>

16:13.043 --> 16:15.712
<i>Use this phone to confirm.</i>

16:18.282 --> 16:21.552
Why didn't you tell me
Jason was missing?

16:21.585 --> 16:22.952
I didn't know.

16:22.986 --> 16:24.654
But the team's out
looking for him.

16:24.655 --> 16:29.655
Yeah, Dick's got a satellite
searching for Jason's tracker.

16:29.860 --> 16:31.695
So, what else is up?

16:31.729 --> 16:32.897
With you.

16:32.929 --> 16:35.500
Uh...

16:35.533 --> 16:41.158
After Trigon, I thought that
all my drama would be over.

16:42.005 --> 16:44.041
- Is he back?
- No.

16:44.075 --> 16:47.442
I just thought
that I would be...

16:47.443 --> 16:48.546
normal.

16:48.580 --> 16:53.049
But it's just all boys
all the time.

16:53.083 --> 16:57.488
No school, nonstop training...

16:57.520 --> 16:59.722
And...

16:59.756 --> 17:01.106
And this.

17:05.296 --> 17:07.665
What is that?

17:07.699 --> 17:11.568
Uh, this thing comes out
when I sleep.

17:11.603 --> 17:15.873
Gar said it looked like
a black cloud

17:15.905 --> 17:17.675
filled with razor blades.

17:17.709 --> 17:20.278
The other day
I almost choked out Jason.

17:20.310 --> 17:22.413
- When did it start?
- After Trigon.

17:22.445 --> 17:24.181
At first I thought
it was punishment,

17:24.182 --> 17:27.415
or that he came back
somehow,

17:27.416 --> 17:30.587
but this isn't Trigon.

17:30.622 --> 17:33.757
I can feel that he's gone.
It's...

17:33.790 --> 17:36.560
It's me.

17:36.594 --> 17:40.763
When my father
ripped out my heart,

17:40.798 --> 17:43.567
I changed.

17:43.601 --> 17:45.036
I turned into
something different.

17:45.068 --> 17:47.438
Something I can't control.

17:47.471 --> 17:49.173
And I know it sounds crazy...

17:49.207 --> 17:52.042
No, it doesn't.

17:52.076 --> 17:55.778
On my planet
we have a name for it.

17:55.813 --> 17:59.182
It's called transfiguration.

17:59.217 --> 18:02.921
All babies wear
Sawar bracelets.

18:02.953 --> 18:05.856
In order to suppress
the ability to make Starfire

18:05.891 --> 18:10.260
until they reach maturity
and can control their powers.

18:10.294 --> 18:13.330
Normally this works.

18:13.364 --> 18:15.333
- But not for me.
- Why?

18:15.365 --> 18:16.634
I don't know.

18:16.667 --> 18:20.471
My powers
just wouldn't stay caged.

18:20.505 --> 18:25.505
People like us are destined
to be special, Rachel.

18:25.643 --> 18:29.614
Maybe that's why
this is happening to you.

18:29.646 --> 18:32.083
The more you try
to suppress your powers,

18:32.084 --> 18:35.219
the harder they'll resist.

18:35.252 --> 18:38.088
But the prophesy you found

18:38.122 --> 18:41.224
said that I was supposed
to destroy worlds.

18:41.259 --> 18:43.826
Or save worlds.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.730
We're not born good or bad.

18:46.765 --> 18:51.765
The choices you make
define your destiny.

18:51.766 --> 18:53.637
Trigon chose darkness.

18:53.671 --> 18:58.008
I have to choose
what my future holds.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.242
You will, too.

18:59.277 --> 19:01.612
So that's it.

19:03.280 --> 19:08.251
I just decide to be good.

19:08.286 --> 19:13.286
It's a little more
complicated at times, but yes.

19:39.182 --> 19:43.287
Kory?

19:43.320 --> 19:46.770
What happened to Jason?

19:52.329 --> 19:56.829
Let's talk
in the training room.

19:59.936 --> 20:01.172
It's bad.

20:01.204 --> 20:03.307
I can tell.

20:03.340 --> 20:08.340
They don't think we can
handle hearing the truth.

20:08.613 --> 20:10.848
I know a way to find out.

20:10.882 --> 20:12.382
You should have
thrown that girl out

20:12.383 --> 20:13.883
the minute you knew
she was Deathstroke's daughter.

20:13.884 --> 20:16.386
Wait a minute. Pirate girl
is this guy's daughter?

20:16.421 --> 20:17.820
Yeah, and he wants her back.

20:17.821 --> 20:18.722
Which we can't do.

20:18.723 --> 20:20.391
Why not?
It's not a crazy idea!

20:20.424 --> 20:21.959
You're not serious.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.628
I'm serious about ending this with
Deathstroke once and for all.

20:24.662 --> 20:26.097
It might not be pretty,

20:26.098 --> 20:28.398
but neither is watching Jason
get killed by that lunatic.

20:28.432 --> 20:30.769
This isn't Rose's fault.
We all know it.

20:30.801 --> 20:35.740
The only reason we're all still alive
right now is because she's here.

20:35.773 --> 20:38.375
So there's cameras
in every room.

20:38.409 --> 20:42.846
Blame Bruce Wayne.
He built the place.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.080
So where's the sound?

20:44.115 --> 20:46.151
Yeah, I...

20:46.183 --> 20:49.086
I don't feel comfortable doing this.
It feels sketchy.

20:49.119 --> 20:51.122
Aren't you tired
of being lied to?

20:51.154 --> 20:52.656
Dick isn't
lying to us.

20:52.690 --> 20:54.991
He doesn't want us
to get involved.

20:55.025 --> 20:57.027
He's protecting us.

20:57.028 --> 21:00.964
How does being kept in the
dark make any of us safer?

21:00.998 --> 21:02.634
They're hiding something.

21:02.666 --> 21:04.969
And I want to know what it is.

21:05.001 --> 21:07.806
Don't you?

21:07.838 --> 21:10.708
<i>Why don't we find this
guy and neutralize him?</i>

21:10.741 --> 21:13.210
It's not that easy.

21:13.243 --> 21:15.012
We barely survived
his last attack.

21:15.046 --> 21:19.383
Look, Jason is hurt,
alone, scared.

21:19.416 --> 21:22.153
And I...

21:22.185 --> 21:25.256
We all know
what that feels like.

21:25.288 --> 21:26.723
Bottom line is,

21:26.758 --> 21:29.827
<i>he's one of us
and she's not.</i>

21:29.861 --> 21:32.196
<i>So handing her over,
if it saves his life,</i>

21:32.230 --> 21:34.675
I don't know about you, but I can
sleep a little better at night

21:34.699 --> 21:38.134
knowing I did the right thing!

21:38.169 --> 21:42.707
You good with this, Grayson?

21:42.740 --> 21:44.575
<i>- Dick?
- Just give me a second.</i>

21:44.608 --> 21:47.478
Don't listen to 'em.

21:47.511 --> 21:48.746
They are just upset.

21:48.779 --> 21:50.682
Rachel's right,
it's just talk.

21:50.714 --> 21:53.049
Quiet. I want to hear.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.053
She's just a kid.

21:56.086 --> 21:57.954
Deathstroke's kid.

21:57.988 --> 21:59.223
Let's be honest.

21:59.257 --> 22:02.259
The further away from us she
gets, the safer she's gonna be.

22:02.294 --> 22:05.829
<i>If we leave her out there
alone, Deathstroke will hunt her down.</i>

22:05.864 --> 22:07.632
Or worse, we lose leverage
over Deathstroke

22:07.664 --> 22:11.602
once he finds out
she's in the wind.

22:11.635 --> 22:14.438
We've gone down
this path before.

22:14.471 --> 22:16.273
We all know how that ended.

22:16.307 --> 22:21.307
We're not using Deathstroke's
kid to get to him again.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.648
Uh, fuck it.

22:24.682 --> 22:26.583
I'll take her there myself.

22:26.584 --> 22:27.683
Good luck trying to stop me.

22:27.684 --> 22:29.586
Wait, have you lost your mind?

22:29.619 --> 22:31.521
<i>You're all
turning into monsters</i>

22:31.556 --> 22:33.724
<i>instead of trying to
figure out how to fight one.</i>

22:33.758 --> 22:35.593
<i>Thank God for Kory.</i>

22:35.625 --> 22:36.827
She doesn't even know Rose.

22:36.861 --> 22:38.494
<i>We all need to
get our shit together</i>

22:38.496 --> 22:40.107
<i>and figure out
how to fight him as a team.</i>

22:40.131 --> 22:43.433
- Rose?
<i>- Otherwise we've already lost Jason.</i>

22:43.467 --> 22:46.166
I wasn't the one...

22:48.573 --> 22:52.042
What was that?

22:52.076 --> 22:55.346
Rose, uh, overheard you guys
talking about giving her up.

22:55.378 --> 23:00.084
- She's trying to leave.
- Shit.

23:01.219 --> 23:04.488
<i>Initiating
system lockdown protocol.</i>

23:05.623 --> 23:08.923
<i>Access denied.</i>

23:11.394 --> 23:13.194
Rose!

23:16.433 --> 23:17.433
Rose?

23:27.411 --> 23:29.646
Hey.

23:29.681 --> 23:31.215
Don't do this.

23:31.249 --> 23:33.817
Look, we can talk and, like, have
cookies and milk or something.

23:33.852 --> 23:38.821
Hey!

23:39.857 --> 23:41.157
I don't wanna hurt you, kid.

23:41.192 --> 23:43.894
Yeah, right.

23:43.926 --> 23:45.429
Ow!

23:45.462 --> 23:48.999
That fuckin' hurt.

23:49.032 --> 23:50.134
Okay, fuck this.

23:56.906 --> 23:59.544
Hank!

23:59.576 --> 24:02.145
Let her go.

24:14.858 --> 24:17.228
Get out of my way, Rachel.

24:17.260 --> 24:19.864
You don't have to run, Rose.

24:19.897 --> 24:22.599
Dick will make sure
you're safe.

24:22.633 --> 24:24.602
I promise.

24:24.634 --> 24:26.403
You've been nice to me,

24:26.436 --> 24:29.606
but I won't ask you twice.

24:29.640 --> 24:31.942
Rose, please.

25:26.063 --> 25:27.731
Rose!

25:27.765 --> 25:29.865
Rachel, don't.

25:41.412 --> 25:42.461
Rachel.

25:47.351 --> 25:51.823
I'm sorry, kid.

25:51.855 --> 25:56.506
What are we
supposed to do now?

26:02.298 --> 26:03.667
She's alive.

26:05.736 --> 26:07.836
What the hell?

26:21.719 --> 26:23.453
Rachel!

26:23.487 --> 26:24.788
Leave me alone.

26:24.821 --> 26:26.824
Listen, I know what happened.

26:26.857 --> 26:29.093
You were wrong.

26:29.126 --> 26:34.126
Some of us don't get to decide
who we are.

26:34.163 --> 26:36.413
We're born bad.

26:47.344 --> 26:50.048
So...

26:50.080 --> 26:54.451
which problem
do you wanna fix first?

27:06.897 --> 27:09.199
You really are
a pathetic piece of shit.

27:09.232 --> 27:10.902
You know that?

27:10.934 --> 27:15.338
Rose deserves better than you
for a father.

27:15.372 --> 27:16.606
Yeah.

27:16.641 --> 27:17.976
Some freak in a ski mask

27:18.009 --> 27:23.009
whose name sounds like
a bad case of VD.

27:23.181 --> 27:25.415
My friends will never
give her up.

27:25.449 --> 27:27.884
You know that.

27:27.919 --> 27:30.919
Well, then,
you're the price they pay.

27:33.657 --> 27:35.792
Fuck you,
you pretentious asshole.

27:35.826 --> 27:38.663
Hey, look at me.

27:38.695 --> 27:40.298
I'm not scared of you.

27:40.332 --> 27:42.232
You should be terrified.

27:42.267 --> 27:43.800
But instead,
you're being played

27:43.835 --> 27:46.737
by that charlatan,
Dick Grayson,

27:46.770 --> 27:49.640
who gives costumes
to foolish kids,

27:49.673 --> 27:53.010
making them believe
that they're heroes.

27:53.044 --> 27:58.044
Leading you,
like lambs to slaughter.

27:58.449 --> 28:00.750
But not to worry,

28:00.785 --> 28:03.318
soon you'll learn.

28:04.256 --> 28:09.055
For death
leads to purification.

28:18.335 --> 28:20.671
You okay, Troy?

28:22.973 --> 28:25.210
It's been a night.

28:25.242 --> 28:27.045
You want to tell me
why this Deathstroke guy

28:27.077 --> 28:32.028
is getting
under everyone's skin?

28:32.348 --> 28:35.419
It doesn't matter.

28:35.451 --> 28:37.355
Now he has Jason.

28:37.388 --> 28:39.623
Seems like no matter
how much we try and move on,

28:39.656 --> 28:42.792
the past just
keeps coming back.

28:42.826 --> 28:44.961
I understand that.

28:44.996 --> 28:46.963
Your interruption?

28:46.998 --> 28:48.432
Wow. That bad, huh?

28:48.465 --> 28:51.868
What, some jilted ex
try and drag you back home?

28:51.903 --> 28:55.337
Drag me home? Yes.

28:55.338 --> 28:56.973
Ex? Not so much.

28:57.008 --> 28:59.876
He was my bodyguard.

28:59.911 --> 29:03.479
Since when
do you need a bodyguard?

29:03.480 --> 29:07.785
Royal protection services.

29:07.817 --> 29:12.355
Royal as in like...

29:12.388 --> 29:13.857
Fuck.

29:13.891 --> 29:17.594
Does Dick know?

29:17.595 --> 29:18.596
So you're like...

29:18.628 --> 29:23.467
On my planet,
I am next in line.

29:23.500 --> 29:25.269
I wanna stay here,

29:25.303 --> 29:29.306
but I don't know
if I have a choice.

29:29.338 --> 29:32.910
Funny.

29:32.943 --> 29:37.943
I'd rather be
anywhere else but here.

29:46.022 --> 29:49.259
Her vitals are stable.

29:49.294 --> 29:54.094
I know
I got carried away today.

29:59.203 --> 30:01.806
We're gonna get Jason back.

30:01.838 --> 30:04.674
It's more than that, Dawn.

30:04.709 --> 30:07.778
All those times

30:07.811 --> 30:09.761
that Coach...

30:15.086 --> 30:18.655
I know what it's like.

30:18.689 --> 30:21.558
Sitting in the dark,

30:21.592 --> 30:24.260
alone,

30:24.294 --> 30:25.829
hurt,

30:25.863 --> 30:29.799
praying for somebody,

30:29.834 --> 30:32.435
hell, anybody,

30:32.469 --> 30:36.272
to come and save you.

30:36.306 --> 30:41.179
And waiting,

30:41.211 --> 30:44.511
but nobody ever comes.

30:46.585 --> 30:47.585
Hank.

30:47.586 --> 30:48.686
I joked about leaving him,

30:48.720 --> 30:53.525
but I'm not ready to give
up on that little asshole.

30:53.557 --> 30:58.557
No matter how much he makes me want
to punch him in the face sometimes.

31:00.564 --> 31:02.732
Hey.

31:02.767 --> 31:05.903
We can't give up.

31:05.936 --> 31:08.439
Kory's right.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.239
If we turn ourselves
into monsters

31:10.240 --> 31:12.108
trying to fight Deathstroke,

31:12.109 --> 31:17.143
there won't be anything good
left when it's over.

31:37.500 --> 31:40.500
We need to talk.

31:42.372 --> 31:44.575
Okay.

31:44.607 --> 31:46.477
After we kill Deathstroke,

31:46.509 --> 31:47.944
this is over.

31:49.747 --> 31:51.114
The Titans?

31:51.115 --> 31:52.615
We don't need to go there.

31:52.650 --> 31:56.286
I wasn't asking.

31:56.287 --> 31:57.587
We both know
Deathstroke didn't just

31:57.588 --> 32:01.525
pull Dr. Light's name
out of a hat.

32:01.557 --> 32:03.294
This place,

32:03.327 --> 32:06.730
what we did,
it's all coming back on us,

32:06.763 --> 32:08.965
which maybe we deserve.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.835
But these kids,

32:10.867 --> 32:13.438
none of this is on them.

32:13.471 --> 32:16.441
They had no idea
what they were signing up for.

32:16.473 --> 32:18.508
Not telling them
might have been easier for you,

32:18.509 --> 32:20.911
but it wasn't right.

32:20.944 --> 32:24.315
Reopening this tower
was a mistake.

32:24.348 --> 32:28.952
How many people have to die
for you to realize that?

32:28.986 --> 32:31.055
Whatever reason you did it,

32:31.087 --> 32:32.655
whether it was selfish,

32:32.656 --> 32:35.101
or you just wanted to paper over
the past with some new experiment

32:35.125 --> 32:39.297
to make us forget what we did,
it doesn't matter.

32:39.329 --> 32:42.066
This isn't about you anymore.

32:42.098 --> 32:45.669
Or us.

32:45.702 --> 32:46.936
End your little experiment

32:46.971 --> 32:50.270
or I will burn
this place down myself.

32:58.115 --> 33:00.250
Hank was right.

33:00.284 --> 33:01.685
You were all right.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.821
Jason needs us. We can't just
stand here and do nothing.

33:04.855 --> 33:07.023
Deathstroke wants
to make a trade,

33:07.057 --> 33:09.026
we make a trade.

33:09.059 --> 33:10.861
We can't hand over Rose.

33:10.894 --> 33:13.864
No, we can't. We won't.

33:13.897 --> 33:15.767
But I have an idea.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.535
<i>Gar, you and Rachel
stay here with Rose.</i>

33:20.738 --> 33:22.807
<i>Protect the Tower.</i>

33:22.839 --> 33:24.608
<i>I'll contact Deathstroke.</i>

33:24.643 --> 33:27.845
<i>Confirm our meetup
at the Plaza.</i>

33:27.877 --> 33:29.846
<i>And then we take him down</i>

33:29.880 --> 33:31.714
once and for all.

33:31.749 --> 33:33.098
Together.

33:39.757 --> 33:41.825
You really gonna do this?

33:41.826 --> 33:43.960
Heard through the grapevine
you might be going home.

33:43.961 --> 33:45.997
"Might" being
the operative word.

33:46.029 --> 33:47.731
So you haven't decided
for sure yet?

33:47.766 --> 33:50.367
Because I'd really like it
if you'd stay.

33:50.401 --> 33:52.736
With the team.
They could use your help.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.404
They could use my help, huh?

33:54.439 --> 33:56.508
- You're a natural leader, Kory.
- Uh-huh.

33:56.540 --> 33:59.876
Why didn't you
ask for help before then?

34:03.079 --> 34:04.781
A few years ago,
I came to San Francisco

34:04.815 --> 34:08.686
to get out of Batman's shadow.

34:08.719 --> 34:13.719
I opened up this place with
Hank, Donna, Dawn and Garth.

34:14.693 --> 34:17.795
That version of the Tower
didn't end so well.

34:17.827 --> 34:19.797
When Garth died,

34:19.829 --> 34:22.034
it nearly broke us all.

34:22.067 --> 34:25.936
So when I came back, I didn't want
to ask them for help because...

34:25.969 --> 34:27.804
You wanted to protect them.

34:27.806 --> 34:30.641
Or maybe I didn't know
how to ask for help.

34:30.672 --> 34:33.043
It wasn't

34:33.077 --> 34:35.313
how I was raised.

34:35.346 --> 34:38.081
I thought it was
the right thing to do,

34:38.114 --> 34:40.184
but it didn't turn out
the way I wanted.

34:40.217 --> 34:41.818
Anyway,

34:41.851 --> 34:43.652
the Titans need your help.

34:43.686 --> 34:46.056
Think about it.

34:46.090 --> 34:50.027
I can do that.

34:50.061 --> 34:54.530
You ready for this, Grayson?

34:54.565 --> 34:56.568
Yep.

34:56.601 --> 34:59.135
By the way,
I like your new hair.

34:59.170 --> 35:01.869
Thanks.

35:10.646 --> 35:12.148
We set?

35:12.182 --> 35:13.851
<i>Plaza's clear.</i>

35:13.884 --> 35:14.884
Yep.

35:21.724 --> 35:25.128
I'm in position.

35:25.161 --> 35:27.231
<i>Dick, you copy?</i>

35:27.264 --> 35:29.967
<i>Dick, come in.</i>

35:30.000 --> 35:33.403
<i>Anybody got eyes on Dick?</i>

35:33.438 --> 35:35.273
<i>Dick,
we're at the Plaza.</i>

35:35.306 --> 35:37.108
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

35:38.842 --> 35:40.710
- Sorry, guys.
- Dick?

35:40.744 --> 35:42.543
Other plans.

35:51.989 --> 35:54.838
I know you're here.

35:57.862 --> 36:02.862
I'm sure this has nothing
to do with Jason or Rose.

36:04.434 --> 36:08.405
You want your pound of flesh.

36:08.438 --> 36:12.844
Revenge for what happened.

36:12.876 --> 36:16.277
And I want this to end
once and for all.

36:18.682 --> 36:23.632
So how about
we make a deal, huh?

36:37.201 --> 36:39.036
You can have me

36:39.070 --> 36:42.039
instead of Rose or Jason.

36:42.074 --> 36:47.074
Pretty sure I'm the one
you're mad at anyway.

36:48.079 --> 36:49.579
Here I am.

36:53.817 --> 36:55.885
Unarmed.

36:57.755 --> 37:00.755
You never learn, do you?

37:05.096 --> 37:08.032
Always the hero.

37:08.065 --> 37:13.065
But you're not gonna
dictate how this will go.

37:13.103 --> 37:15.739
You're not a martyr.

37:15.773 --> 37:18.509
You're a con man.

37:18.543 --> 37:23.114
Preying on those weak enough
to follow you.

37:23.146 --> 37:25.682
The problem with con men...

37:25.717 --> 37:28.985
is that they never know
when to stop.

37:29.018 --> 37:31.389
And somebody else always pays.

37:31.422 --> 37:32.956
Let's just
get this over with, huh?

37:39.163 --> 37:41.163
Get up.

37:49.607 --> 37:53.356
Take a look.

38:04.021 --> 38:08.159
Say goodbye to your friend.

38:11.429 --> 38:15.532
You seriously listening
to this bullshit?

38:15.565 --> 38:19.670
What are you doing here?

38:19.704 --> 38:21.615
Did you really think you were
gonna compliment my hair

38:21.639 --> 38:26.639
instead of saying goodbye,
Dick Grayson?

39:13.623 --> 39:15.458
Go get Jason.

39:18.329 --> 39:20.463
Jason, hang in there, buddy.

40:51.322 --> 40:55.592
No!

40:58.596 --> 41:01.164
Jason, give me your hand.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.032
Here.

41:03.067 --> 41:05.436
Hold on.

41:10.641 --> 41:13.577
Don't let go.
