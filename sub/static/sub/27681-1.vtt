20:05.405 --> 20:07.285
It's the funnest thing,
when we are together.

20:07.285 --> 20:07.445
We would never have thought,
back then,

20:07.445 --> 20:08.885
We would never have thought,
back then,

20:08.885 --> 20:09.045
that seven years on,
we would still be best mates.

20:09.045 --> 20:10.845

53:41.845 --> 53:42.525
The first time I realised
