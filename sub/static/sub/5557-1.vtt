          have you been singing?

07:01.756 --> 07:03.723
  I've been singing             
  since i was a kid.            

07:03.758 --> 07:04.857
      You know,

      There wasn't any listening
      to secular music.         

07:09.597 --> 07:12.098
       One time, i was sneaking,
       listening to an usher cd,

07:12.133 --> 07:14.100
                "confessions" --
                best album ever.

           you're listening to?"

          were singing.         

07:31.953 --> 07:33.986
       It wasn't the music.     
       It was the message.      

07:34.021 --> 07:36.088
                 Yes, ma'am.

 Mark: I'm 14 years old.        
 Then my mom drops a bomb on me.

07:39.127 --> 07:40.693
   "you're going to             
   chicago high school

   For agricultural sciences,   
   which is on a 100-acre farm."

07:43.664 --> 07:45.364
Why would you do that to me, ma?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.233
   I visited there              
  for a conference,             

07:47.268 --> 07:48.968
   And the children             
   were so polite.              

07:49.003 --> 07:50.870
I said, "this is where          
   mark should go."             

07:50.905 --> 07:52.071
              What?!            

07:52.106 --> 07:55.074
        I'm picking corn.       
  I got classes in a greenhouse.

07:55.109 --> 07:56.308
             I stink.           

07:56.344 --> 07:58.377
         There's chickens       
   running all over the place.  

07:58.413 --> 08:01.514
    I don't even like animals.  
       I'm scared of dogs.      

08:01.549 --> 08:03.616
  There was no real art program,

08:03.651 --> 08:05.918
     But they had to give you   
          a music class,        

08:05.953 --> 08:08.187
     And that really gave me    
    the opportunity to shine.   

08:08.222 --> 08:11.157
       I got to really find     
      my love for the stage.    

08:11.192 --> 08:13.793
Coming right out of high school,
i started in community theater. 

08:13.828 --> 08:16.762
 I was able to transition to tv.

08:16.798 --> 08:18.764
       I played a dead guy      
        on a show before,       

08:18.800 --> 08:20.800
      And i had to audition     
          to play dead.         

08:20.835 --> 08:23.335
  Like, it was a whole -- i beat
   out other guys to play dead. 

08:23.371 --> 08:25.438
       We was all laid out      
   in the middle of the floor,  

08:25.473 --> 08:26.472
        And they chose me.      

08:26.507 --> 08:29.375
    I was the chosen dead guy.  

08:29.410 --> 08:32.445
     Even though i get roles,   
   i'm still a starving artist. 

08:32.480 --> 08:35.514
       I love "the voice."      
   i remember the first season. 

08:35.549 --> 08:38.751
If i could work with one coach, 
my coach would be blake shelton.

08:38.785 --> 08:40.285
     Nobody would expect it,    

08:40.321 --> 08:42.822
       And he would push me     
        and challenge me.       

08:42.857 --> 08:44.457
  I could not sleep last night. 

08:44.492 --> 08:46.792
    I was just up every hour,   
           every hour.          

08:46.828 --> 08:49.728
       I finally feel like      
        this is my chance.      

08:49.764 --> 08:51.797
  "the voice," this performance,

08:51.833 --> 08:53.299
        It's the end all,       
         it's the be all.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.665
    The show needs more voices  
           like yours.          

15:33.701 --> 15:36.001
    Pharrell, if you want to go 
   ahead and wrap it on up, man.

15:36.036 --> 15:36.969

            and twisted it.     

15:39.306 --> 15:41.306
         Daly: And later,

15:41.342 --> 15:43.942
  For the most surprising blind 
  audition they have ever seen.

            Pharrell:           
    What makes it super cool,   

15:46.347 --> 15:49.114
    All of that individuality   
   standing onstage right now.  

15:49.149 --> 15:52.317
      That was the trippiest    
   turn around, blind audition, 

15:52.353 --> 15:54.486
    Freakiest thing i've ever   
     experienced in my life.

          I'm on my way         
    to hollywood, california,   

16:04.398 --> 16:05.864
    To meet up with kota wade.  

16:05.900 --> 16:09.234
 She and her parents own and run
  a music venue called amplyfi, 

16:09.270 --> 16:11.103
      Where she's been busy     
        honing her skills,      

16:11.138 --> 16:12.638
          Getting ready         
    for her big blind audition

16:19.213 --> 16:21.880
        We opened amplyfi       
      about five years ago.     

16:21.916 --> 16:25.250
  My dad, between the two of us,
       we cover the sound.      

16:25.286 --> 16:26.418
   Check mike two.

              Okay, we're good. 

16:27.621 --> 16:30.522
     And my mom takes care of   
      the money and tickets.    

16:30.557 --> 16:32.391
     Why did your family want   
     to get in this business?   

16:32.426 --> 16:34.159
I was in bands in high school   
      and stuff,                

16:34.194 --> 16:36.128
And there was nowhere           
   for me to play.              

16:36.163 --> 16:37.562
         It's always nice       
          to see parents        

16:37.598 --> 16:39.798
  Who support their kid's dream 
            of music.           

16:39.833 --> 16:41.433
 This is like that on steroids.

  since she started doing bands.

16:43.437 --> 16:44.937
        Yeah.                   
Daly: What does that mean to you

16:44.972 --> 16:46.705
      To have their support     
          at this level?        

16:46.740 --> 16:49.041
     It's kind of               
  an unreal feeling.            

16:49.076 --> 16:54.046
Kota: My parents have sacrificed
   a lot for me and my music.   

16:54.081 --> 16:55.547
       When i was about 11,     

16:55.582 --> 16:58.684
      We moved to california    
         from new mexico.       

16:58.719 --> 17:01.320
        Eric:                   
Kota has worked so hard,        

17:01.355 --> 17:03.021
  Developing herself            
    as a musician.              

17:03.057 --> 17:06.223
As a parent, you're just --     
just proud to see them          

17:06.260 --> 17:08.193
  Pursuing something            
that makes them happy           

17:08.228 --> 17:10.162
And makes other people          
        happy.                  

17:10.196 --> 17:12.597
              Kota:

17:14.001 --> 17:17.269

       of every opportunity     

17:22.108 --> 17:25.176
          To show people        
        what we're about.       

17:25.212 --> 17:29.414
     For me, turning a chair,   
    it would mean a huge deal.  

17:29.450 --> 17:34.353
      But i think my parents    
    would just be so excited.   

17:34.388 --> 17:36.655
 [ voice breaking ] they're just
  always there, no matter what,

           I don't know         
    if i let them know enough.  

17:44.932 --> 17:48.266
   There's no other place that  
  you can get coaching like this

17:48.302 --> 17:50.635
        To help me move on      
        to the next level,      

17:50.671 --> 17:55.340
 So getting any kind of critique
   would just be life-changing. 

17:55.376 --> 17:57.242
  There is no backup plan for me

17:57.277 --> 17:59.144

           That means that

But then when we turned around, 
there is a beautiful-color hair,

   A dress, pair of boots, and  
 you're punching the air like...

     On paper, i don't seem like

Let's be fair, though.

      on paper.

Blake's just a bad idea         
for a coach just in

23:42.522 --> 23:44.022

        to come and join,       

23:45.959 --> 23:48.326
      And i moved to america

         Alyssa sheridan.       

33:46.893 --> 33:50.728
That song's really hard to sing,
             lots of long notes.
             Yeah.              

33:50.763 --> 33:51.929
                 Maybe it was   
              just a song choice

33:51.965 --> 33:54.131
      That was a little too hard
          for you right now,    

33:54.167 --> 33:56.267
              But you have      
       a really beautiful voice.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.501
            Thank you.          

33:57.537 --> 33:59.303
 There is a sweetness           
   and an innocence             

33:59.339 --> 34:00.571
 And a vulnerability            
    to your voice               

34:00.606 --> 34:01.806
   That you should              
     never lose.                

34:01.841 --> 34:02.907
   Moving forward,              

34:02.942 --> 34:04.308
  Just keep singing             
and keep getting better.        

34:04.344 --> 34:05.676
That's all we ever do.          

34:05.712 --> 34:09.413
    I think that you should go  
      and work on your voice    

34:09.449 --> 34:11.482
   And bring a technical skill  
              to it             

34:11.516 --> 34:13.250
          And come back         
      and slay it next time     

34:13.286 --> 34:14.418
             And turn           
       four chairs around.

34:17.590 --> 34:21.257
    Gwen: Alyssa had a really   
   emotional, sensitive voice,  

34:21.293 --> 34:23.494
        And when you have       
  such a fragile kind of voice, 

34:23.529 --> 34:26.097
   It's really hard to hold out 
   really long notes like that, 

34:26.132 --> 34:27.130
        So i felt for her.      

34:27.166 --> 34:28.565
   I think she had              
  something natural,            

34:28.601 --> 34:30.501
But she was also nervous,       
     too, though.               

34:30.536 --> 34:32.603
    I love that song so much,   
             though.            

34:32.638 --> 34:33.804
         Oh, i love you.        

34:33.840 --> 34:35.106
             Alyssa:            
     As far as i'm concerned,   

34:35.141 --> 34:37.108
I made my stepdad, floyd, proud.

34:37.143 --> 34:40.411
  If there's anyone that doesn't
 let something get in their way,

34:40.446 --> 34:41.344
                  It's her.     

34:41.380 --> 34:42.780
              I love            
     every single one of you.

You turned it too late!         

34:56.529 --> 34:58.729

    another voice like yours.

                 to that guy,

It was absolutely asinine.

   Let's meet our next artist,  
      15-year-old siahna im     

35:28.027 --> 35:29.527
     From auburn, washington.   

35:29.562 --> 35:32.296
         I'm half korean        
    and half french canadian.   

35:32.331 --> 35:37.234
   My mom is a math teacher,    
so when i get an 80% on my test,

35:37.270 --> 35:39.203
           She's like,          
 "you have to retake that test."

35:39.238 --> 35:43.274
   My dad is the exact opposite 
            of my mom.          

35:43.309 --> 35:45.576
     He is one crazy person.    

35:45.611 --> 35:48.145
             I'm gonna beat you.

35:48.181 --> 35:50.347

   Old man?!                    

35:50.383 --> 35:53.017
    One time, my dad was just   
     driving down the street,   

35:53.052 --> 35:57.088
     And he saw a school bus    
          was for sale.         

35:57.123 --> 36:00.224
 Backyard, and we never used it.

36:00.259 --> 36:02.960
          That was a --         
     i don't know -- mistake.

           [ laughter ]         

36:04.130 --> 36:06.163
     Siahna: But like my dad,   
       i'm a weird person.      

36:06.199 --> 36:08.099
  Being normal would be boring. 

36:08.134 --> 36:09.366
              How'd you get into
                   singing?     

36:09.402 --> 36:12.870
In 3rd grade, i watched a video 
   of ray charles,              

36:12.905 --> 36:15.973
And that's when i decided       
i wanted to sing soul music.    

36:16.008 --> 36:19.510
   Some music comes in one ear  
   and goes out the other ear,  

36:19.545 --> 36:21.879
      But i feel soul music     
         goes in one ear        

36:21.914 --> 36:23.981
And goes straight to your heart.
           [ laughs ]           

36:24.016 --> 36:26.784
There's not very many places    
to sing where i live,           

36:26.819 --> 36:30.588
    So i just sang              
at open mikes in cafés.         

36:30.623 --> 36:33.924
          I really like         
   that it's a blind audition,  

36:33.993 --> 36:37.261
   Because when people hear me  
   talk, they underestimate me. 

36:37.296 --> 36:38.863
          They're like,         
   "she's just a little girl."  

36:38.898 --> 36:41.832
I'd consider myself an old soul.

36:41.868 --> 36:44.969
          And so, i know        
    if i got onto "the voice,"  

36:45.004 --> 36:47.671
      They'd help me develop    
      who i am as an artist     

36:47.707 --> 36:50.274
     'cause i'd learn so much   
         from everybody.

           most of all,

       where my roots are,      

47:14.166 --> 47:15.599
     And that's what i love.    

47:15.634 --> 47:17.100
         And, obviously,        
      my voice is different.    

47:17.136 --> 47:19.035
       I get called "ma'am"     
    on the phone all the time.  

47:19.071 --> 47:20.237
       Me too.                  

47:20.272 --> 47:21.605
       I get called "ma'am"     
     at every drive-through.    

47:21.640 --> 47:22.906
          Through that,         
          i had to learn        

47:22.941 --> 47:25.041
That being different is actually
     what made me special.      

47:25.077 --> 47:26.610
                       Yeah.    
          It's my gift,         

47:26.645 --> 47:29.179
    And so this, for me, is just
    an amazing opportunity      

47:29.214 --> 47:31.014
       To share that            
       it's okay to be different

47:31.049 --> 47:33.884
   And it's okay to be yourself,
   because you're made that way,

47:33.919 --> 47:35.385

         intended for you to be.

  23-year-old nadjah nicole     
  from new castle, delaware.    

56:05.964 --> 56:07.664
  My dad was in the military,   

56:07.666 --> 56:10.967
And when i was in high school,  
  i went to military school,    

56:10.969 --> 56:12.769
   And i couldn't stand it.     
          [ laughs ]            

56:12.771 --> 56:15.138
        I didn't want           
      to wear a uniform,        

56:15.140 --> 56:17.573
      But i was afforded        
  the opportunities to sing     

56:17.575 --> 56:18.875
      At political events.      

56:18.877 --> 56:21.477
      I enjoyed the fact        
  that i could move people,     

56:21.479 --> 56:23.479
      So i started doing        
        talent shows.           

56:23.481 --> 56:27.550
At 16, biggest performance of my
life was at the apollo theater. 

56:27.552 --> 56:31.921
       It was amazing.          
After i won, people swarmed me. 

56:31.923 --> 56:35.792
  It made me more aware that    
i could actually be somebody,   

56:35.794 --> 56:37.760
      And when i decided        
       to go to college         

56:37.762 --> 56:39.195
  And i started gigging more,   

56:39.197 --> 56:41.664
      It really made me         
       more confident.          

56:41.666 --> 56:43.399
    And then i got pregnant.    

56:43.401 --> 56:46.202
   I didn't tell my parents     
          just yet.             

56:46.204 --> 56:50.306
 I didn't want them to think    
    that my life was over.

57:03.254 --> 57:05.321
    Nadjah: My parents --       
they were extremely supportive, 

57:05.323 --> 57:07.824

            is now 2 years old.

57:09.894 --> 57:11.394

        Oh.

 And journey is going to know   
  that mommy worked hard...

            For her.            

57:32.884 --> 57:34.851
              Oh!               

57:34.853 --> 57:38.755
Watching her grow with          
the music, the baby, the school,

57:38.757 --> 57:40.857
        It's just been          
       an amazing ride.         

57:40.859 --> 57:43.426
   I couldn't be more proud     
          of nadjah.

              I'm happy for her.

I will be singing "tightrope"   
      by janelle monae.

This song represents the type   
 of artist that i want to be.

   I want to be that person     
  that you can connect with.

01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:38.908
I've been doing music ever since
    i can really remember.      

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:41.710
 When i was 9, i was singing    
     at a church service,       

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:42.878
  And some guys came up to me.  

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.713
          They said,            
"we're getting a band together. 

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:45.881
    Would you like to join?"    

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:47.516

 "yeah, that'll be awesome."    

01:04:47.518 --> 01:04:50.986
    The band that i joined      
   is called silver hammer,     

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:53.055
  And i'm the youngest member.  

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.524
 I've been playing with them    
   for about six years now.     

01:04:55.526 --> 01:04:57.660
And what's it like to go        
to one of their shows and       
see braiden up there?           

01:04:57.662 --> 01:05:00.830
  Whenever he gets in front     
of a crowd, he just lights up.  

01:05:00.832 --> 01:05:03.666
    We've done everything       
 from weddings to restaurants   

01:05:03.668 --> 01:05:04.800
       To concert venues.       

01:05:04.802 --> 01:05:07.903
     He started in church       
 doing the boy soprano thing,   

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:10.072
And then after a couple years,  
   we got him doing ac/dc.      

01:05:10.074 --> 01:05:12.741
   The band doesn't really      
  get together much anymore     

01:05:12.743 --> 01:05:14.910
      'cause all of them        
     are off in college,        

01:05:14.912 --> 01:05:16.478
 But i got to keep doing this.  

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.880
    I'm not just gonna stop.    

01:05:17.882 --> 01:05:21.016
 This kind of an opportunity    
could definitely change my life.

To work with one of the coaches 

01:05:22.854 --> 01:05:25.421
    Would be a really good      
     learning experience        

01:05:25.423 --> 01:05:28.724

01:05:32.296 --> 01:05:34.697

  just this small-town kid,     

01:05:34.699 --> 01:05:38.567

i could at least give it a shot.

     Sunshine!

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:40.089
           Braiden,             
       how old are you?         

01:07:40.091 --> 01:07:40.956
            I'm 15.             

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:42.124
            -Yeah.              
            -What?              

01:07:42.126 --> 01:07:44.693
      Gwen and pharrell         
 don't ever fight each other.   

01:07:44.695 --> 01:07:47.096
   This is gonna be great!      
        I can't wait!           

01:07:47.098 --> 01:07:48.998
          Pharrell:             
   You're a special person.     

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.034
   You're a 15-year-old boy     
     that plays a guitar.       

01:07:52.036 --> 01:07:55.104
You sing in both of your octaves
      very comfortably.         

01:07:55.106 --> 01:07:56.405
           You have an old soul,

01:07:56.407 --> 01:07:59.108
   And there will never be      
  another voice like yours.     

01:07:59.110 --> 01:08:00.943
    [ cheers and applause ]     

01:08:00.945 --> 01:08:02.544
          And i hear            
      a couple of things        

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.580
   That you could work on,      
         by the way,            

01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:07.950
And i would love the opportunity
to work with someone like you.  

01:08:07.952 --> 01:08:09.218
   You're losing him, gwen.     
      You're losing him.        

01:08:09.220 --> 01:08:10.352
        Say something!          
     Say something quick!       

01:08:10.354 --> 01:08:13.889
        Okay. Braiden,          
  i do know how to help you.    

01:08:13.891 --> 01:08:15.691
     I've been in a band        
        since i'm 17.           

01:08:15.693 --> 01:08:18.460
      I'm also a mother         
        of three boys,          

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:22.231
So i know how to fight for      
someone that i really care about

01:08:22.233 --> 01:08:24.867
     And, like, find out        
     who you want to be.        

01:08:24.868 --> 01:08:26.835
         [ chuckles ]           
        he's so funny.          

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:28.670
  He's looking at pharrell,     
       and he's, like,          

01:08:28.671 --> 01:08:30.406
 Kind of has this little look   
          in his eye            

01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:32.541
Like, "i can't believe          
pharrell's sitting there."      

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:33.942
      Don't look at him!        
      Don't look at him!

  Don't look at him!            

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:39.014
 Braiden, if you had told me    
        when i was 15           

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:42.184
That i was gonna get to perform 
in front of gwen stefani,       

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:45.988
      I would have lost         
           my mind.             

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:48.756
 Gwen: All i'm gonna say is,    
      if you choose me,         

01:08:48.759 --> 01:08:51.460
  You're gonna make my day,     
        like, majorly.

        please be on team gwen. 

01:08:56.767 --> 01:08:59.734
         This is like           
      a custody battle.

          [ laughter ]

    Who are you gonna pick      
 as your coach, man? Come on.   

01:09:05.943 --> 01:09:07.042

            -yeah!              

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:28.764
   Are you serious?

     two of them turned!

         It's crazy!            
     That doesn't happen!

       That was so cool!

 Going up against pharrell --   
    i'm such a fan of him,      

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:51.587
  But at the end of the day,    
you do get sort of competitive, 

01:09:51.589 --> 01:09:53.322
       So you're like,          
  "oh, i want that person."     

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:55.357
    How about that, gwen?

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:59.094
   It was just so shocking      
   that somebody that young     

01:09:59.096 --> 01:10:01.130
   Could have that much tone.   

01:10:01.132 --> 01:10:03.298

     what else he can do.

   Let's meet our next artist.  

01:10:51.081 --> 01:10:52.614
             Michael:           
    My name's michael woolery,  

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:54.316
           And i'm from         
    santa monica, california.   

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:55.918
              Have a good time. 
                 Be yourself.   

01:10:55.953 --> 01:10:57.719
               You're gonna be  
                  fabulous.     

01:10:57.755 --> 01:11:00.088
  I came from a family that was 
  in the entertainment industry.

01:11:00.124 --> 01:11:01.323
     My dad's chuck woolery.    

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:03.425
      People would know him     
     from "love connection."    

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.927
    Two minutes, two seconds.   

01:11:04.962 --> 01:11:08.063
  Michael: My great-grandparents
     were ozzie and harriet.    

01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:11.300
My grandfather was david nelson,
        who is an actor,        

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:13.435
         And his brother        
        was ricky nelson.       

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:17.039
    Ricky's actually a part of  
 the rock and roll hall of fame,

01:11:17.074 --> 01:11:19.007
    And he has 30 top 40 hits.  

01:11:19.043 --> 01:11:20.876
Nice to meet you -- carson.     
              Hey, how are you? 
              Nice to meet you. 

01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:22.844
You had to bring the great      
chuck woolery with you today?   
                          I did.

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.781
You here to take my job?        
What are you doing here?        
         No, no. I'm --         
    this is all about him.      

01:11:25.816 --> 01:11:27.015
    It's not about me.          

01:11:27.051 --> 01:11:28.183
  When did you know             
     that he ha--               

01:11:28.219 --> 01:11:29.885
Took such a, you know,          
genuine interest in music?      

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:31.987
 I taught him like three or four
        chords on guitar,       

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:33.789
     And he just picked it up   
         and ran with it.       

01:11:33.824 --> 01:11:35.591
       Played all the time.     

01:11:35.626 --> 01:11:37.459
        He was much better      
  than i ever even hoped to be. 

01:11:37.494 --> 01:11:39.995
You've got so much entertainment
around your whole family.       
                           Sure.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:43.131
That something you felt like    
you had to do, wanted to do?    

01:11:43.167 --> 01:11:44.833
              It's kind of like 
                the opposite.   

01:11:44.868 --> 01:11:46.468
               I ended up going 
             the athletic route.

01:11:46.503 --> 01:11:48.904
         My parents moved       
       to park city, utah,      

01:11:48.939 --> 01:11:52.608
    When i was 12 years old,    
and i really jumped into skiing.

01:11:52.643 --> 01:11:55.544
     The type of skiing i do    
   is slopestyle and superpipe, 

01:11:55.579 --> 01:11:57.779
          Which involves        
     a lot of flipping around   

01:11:57.815 --> 01:11:59.615
  And doing a series of tricks. 

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.183
        I started training      
       at the olympic park      

01:12:01.218 --> 01:12:03.218
   For the 2014 sochi olympics. 

01:12:03.254 --> 01:12:04.353
       And during practice      

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:06.521
        At one of the two       
    bigger events of the year,  

01:12:06.557 --> 01:12:08.824
        When i dropped in,      
         my leg gave out.       

01:12:08.859 --> 01:12:10.092
       My calf muscle tore.     

01:12:10.127 --> 01:12:13.228
      And then i hit my head    
    really hard at the bottom,  

01:12:13.264 --> 01:12:14.930
    Which gave me a concussion  

01:12:14.965 --> 01:12:17.633
   And pushed my spine forward  
          a little bit.         

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:21.303
    My injury ended everything  
 that i'd hoped for with skiing.

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:24.640
        Right after that,       
     my grandpa passed away.    

01:12:24.675 --> 01:12:28.143
  It was just one of the hardest
    years i've had in my life.  

01:12:29.647 --> 01:12:32.814
    During that time was when   
  i really picked up the guitar 

01:12:32.850 --> 01:12:35.384
       And started putting      
      all my focus in music.    

01:12:35.419 --> 01:12:37.185
 I moved to l.A., and right now,

01:12:37.221 --> 01:12:40.289
    I work at a jewelry store   
     as a sales professional.   

01:12:40.324 --> 01:12:42.190
   Now that this opportunity's  
             come up,           

01:12:42.226 --> 01:12:44.726

        side of the story       

01:12:44.762 --> 01:12:46.662

            to get to.          

01:12:46.697 --> 01:12:50.599
          Through music,        
   i was really able to recover 

01:12:50.634 --> 01:12:53.535
    And just find a whole new   
      identity with myself.     

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.537
         But it's always        
    in the back of your head,   

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.839
     Like, "am i good enough    
    to compete against people   

01:12:57.875 --> 01:12:59.975
    That have been doing this   
       their whole lives?"      

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:03.779
       I just want to find      
  my own identity in the family 

01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:06.748
     And see what i can bring   
          to the table.

because no one was turning,

Arkansas, waiting on you.       

01:24:11.448 --> 01:24:13.381
    Barrett: Blake is an icon   
        in country music,       

01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:15.850
 And now i get to work with him,
     and he gets to help me,    

01:24:15.885 --> 01:24:17.785
      And we're about to do     
       some special things!     

01:24:17.821 --> 01:24:18.987
          I know we are.        
            Watch out.          

01:24:19.022 --> 01:24:20.355
     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:22.523
             Blake:             
I don't know that i've ever seen

01:24:22.559 --> 01:24:24.559
 Somebody walk across this stage

01:24:24.594 --> 01:24:27.095
         With the swagger       
        that barrett had.       

01:24:27.130 --> 01:24:28.396
      I'm blown away by him.    

01:24:28.431 --> 01:24:31.032
         -Here he comes!        
   -There he is -- team blake!  

01:24:31.067 --> 01:24:32.400
              Daddy!            

01:24:32.435 --> 01:24:34.736
         [ laughs ] yeah!       

01:24:34.771 --> 01:24:36.270
         Barrett: I think       
     that my purpose in life    

01:24:36.306 --> 01:24:39.674
     Is to be a great husband   
        and a great father      

01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:42.877
   And that all the things that 
   i've overcome in my journey, 

01:24:42.912 --> 01:24:45.947
      And i hope that people    
 will have watched this audition

01:24:45.982 --> 01:24:49.283
  And maybe gained a little bit 
 of encouragement from my story.

01:24:49.319 --> 01:24:51.319
You're, like, from the country, 
  so they go to you.            

01:24:51.354 --> 01:24:54.222
  The stuff you said to that guy
            was the --          

01:24:54.257 --> 01:24:56.324
          Greatest stuff        
     that he could've heard.    

01:24:56.359 --> 01:24:57.892
 There was nothing he could take
        from what you said      

01:24:57.927 --> 01:24:59.060
                 And put that   
                into motion --  

01:24:59.095 --> 01:25:00.995
       I know what you're doing.
            It doesn't work.    

01:25:01.031 --> 01:25:03.398
Are you ever gonna understand it
  doesn't work when you do that?
    It was absolutely asinine.  

01:25:03.433 --> 01:25:04.699
    It doesn't work             
    when you do that.           

01:25:04.734 --> 01:25:06.667
           [ laughter ]         

01:25:06.703 --> 01:25:10.405
             I mean,            
 he thinks it's gonna get to me.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.674
          You got no game, dude.

01:25:13.710 --> 01:25:15.910
  I can't laugh any more today, 
          or i will die.        

01:25:15.945 --> 01:25:30.358
                You got no game.
[ laughs ]
