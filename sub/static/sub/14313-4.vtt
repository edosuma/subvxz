Previously on WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN

00:09.200 --> 00:10.300
Charles.

00:13.200 --> 00:13.850
Jean!

00:14.300 --> 00:16.700
With Charles and Jean, you know--

00:17.000 --> 00:19.400
unaccounted for, I just
can't think of anything else.

00:20.300 --> 00:24.120
-Hello. I'm Warren.
-Emma Frost.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.950
Yeah. I know who you are.
Question is: why are you here?

00:29.700 --> 00:32.450
I can find Professor Xavier for you.

00:32.750 --> 00:37.000
The simple fact is you cannot
operate Cerebro without a telepath.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.300
My X-Men, I come to you with an urgent message.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.600
-Come to us? From where?
-The future.

00:47.500 --> 00:52.400
The coma you see me in right now,
it would last for twenty years.

00:52.700 --> 00:57.500
I've just awoken from it. And the
world I've found is a nightmare.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.050
Thank you.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.750
Logan.

02:42.550 --> 02:44.800
Logan.

02:45.100 --> 02:47.300
Logan.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.050
Charles?

03:01.600 --> 03:03.300
Charles.

03:07.400 --> 03:11.700
Don't be alarmed, Logan.
We're still at the Institute.

03:12.300 --> 03:17.450
But this is what you might call
a meeting of the minds on the astral plane.

03:17.650 --> 03:22.200
It's through here I'm able to
communicate to you from the future.

03:22.700 --> 03:26.700
-It's really good to see you, Chuck.
-And you, my friend.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.700
-I only wish I were bringing better news.
-Why? What's happening?

03:32.150 --> 03:34.400
I need to show you something.

03:35.100 --> 03:41.600
This is Africa in my time. Twenty years ago
something terrible happened here.

03:41.900 --> 03:45.000
Twenty years? You mean now?

03:47.200 --> 03:52.750
It was a catastrophe so fierce
that no one on the continent survived.

03:55.300 --> 04:01.550
-What could've done something like this?
-Not what. Who. It was Storm.

04:01.900 --> 04:05.900
That dosen't make any sense.
Storm would never attack Africa.

04:06.200 --> 04:11.000
I know. All I can say is she did.
And at the cost of her own life.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.300
You must find her, Logan.
Before it's too late.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.800
I will.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.899
I don't think we're alone.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400
-How'd you get in here?!
-Hm.

04:25.000 --> 04:30.000
Well, you know the security code
and I'm telepathic. You tell me.

04:30.550 --> 04:35.000
We don't need spies in the X-Men, Frost.
You're out of here as of now!

04:36.300 --> 04:40.000
-You'll need my assistance.
-No, I won't!

04:44.300 --> 04:49.900
There dosen't seem to be any climate abnormalities.
In fact, there's hardly a cloud on the sky over all of Africa.

04:50.150 --> 04:53.700
That means whatever's gonna push Storm
over the edge hasen't happened yet.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.100
-We gotta find her, Hank. Fast.
-That will require the use of Cerebro. Which means--

05:00.450 --> 05:01.600
I know, Hank.

05:01.800 --> 05:06.000
-And she'll want something in exchange.
-I know, Hank.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.700
Your attempts to manipulate me are demeaning.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.100
If I perform to your satisfaction,
you favor me by extending my stay here.

05:17.300 --> 05:22.000
-If I assist you, that ends. Now!
-I'm manipulating you?

05:22.300 --> 05:26.470
You showed up at my door and traded
your telepathy for a spot on the team.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.300
Who's using who?

05:28.500 --> 05:32.450
I found the Professor for you.
I've earned my place with the X-Men.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.470
And just like the others you have to
continue earning it every day.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.550
-But you trust them.
-Because they've earned that too.

05:41.500 --> 05:46.600
Trust is a two-way street, Logan.
Find yourself another telepath.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.000
Fine!

06:20.000 --> 06:21.750
I've located her.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.400
Ororo!

06:38.500 --> 06:41.700
-What is next, Abasi?
-The southern crops, Your Highness.

06:42.500 --> 06:46.800
-And later there is the celebration.
-Another? Did we not just have one?

06:47.100 --> 06:50.600
The village looks forward to again
honoring you for your generous bounty.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.900
So be it.

06:55.350 --> 07:00.150
Scott? Are you in there?
You should know we're all heading to Africa.

07:00.750 --> 07:03.000
It's Storm. She's in trouble.

07:03.700 --> 07:05.700
I thought Logan said not to even bother with him.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.050
He did, but the Scott I knew
would've been first on the jet.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.000
Come on.

07:29.000 --> 07:29.900
No.

07:31.300 --> 07:35.800
No, no no no no, no.
I just got her back together! I don't--

07:36.000 --> 07:41.550
Okay, this is only a test run right? Sort of a take her
around the block and roll the carpet out kind of thing, right?

07:41.850 --> 07:44.500
-No. Africa.
-Africa?!

07:45.200 --> 07:47.050
But that's--
But, you guys--

07:50.700 --> 07:53.600
-Be gentle.
-Yeah. Right.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.450
The first scratch is always the most painfull.

08:01.550 --> 08:03.500
So now you can relax.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.900
Thank you. Your gift is well-received.

09:38.700 --> 09:41.350
Your gift is well-received. Thank you.

09:48.550 --> 09:51.000
Your gift is well-received. Thank you.

10:07.300 --> 10:11.050
At long last we meet again,
little street thief.

10:12.000 --> 10:16.300
Now that you have finally returned to your master!

10:21.600 --> 10:25.200
-Your Highness, what is wrong?
-No! No!

10:27.100 --> 10:29.250
Go! Return to your homes!

10:33.300 --> 10:34.800
Who are you?!

10:35.600 --> 10:40.700
You do not remember me, Ororo?
I was like a father to you.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.300
Where is the rest?

10:55.200 --> 11:00.150
-This is all I could get today.
-You scabrous little cheat! You're holding out on me!

11:00.450 --> 11:05.000
No! I-- I was delayed. I ran out of time.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.300
What is more important than earning your keep?!

11:10.700 --> 11:12.150
I have a friend.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.950
As if anyone would care about
a thieving reject like you.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.700
He says I am more than just a thief.

11:19.000 --> 11:23.250
And he fills your head with lies!
Who is he? Tell me!

11:25.400 --> 11:28.700
-I will not!
-You will!

11:33.500 --> 11:36.900
It's him. It's Xavier!

11:37.200 --> 11:42.300
You will pay for this, you ingrateful beggar!
And then so will he!

11:44.900 --> 11:47.800
Your power over this child ceases now, Farouk.

11:48.300 --> 11:58.000
Ah, so the friend is a telepath. Then pit your powers
against mine, trespasser. Because she is my property!

12:00.600 --> 12:03.700
Farouk! But you are destroyed!

12:04.100 --> 12:09.700
Only my flesh. My spirit lives as the Shadow King.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.350
-What do you want?
-To see you wander aimlessly without a home.

12:16.600 --> 12:21.500
Now watch as I burn your
precious Africa to the ground!

12:31.500 --> 12:33.300
No!

12:34.700 --> 12:39.900
-Your Highness, what are you doing?!
-Run, Abasi! Run from the fire!

12:43.200 --> 12:45.200
But there is no fire!

12:56.950 --> 13:06.600
That's it, Ororo. Unleash the elements.
Try and save your homeland, before it is lost forever.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.950
-It's begun. And it's expanding at an alarming rate.
-Hang on.

15:42.100 --> 15:49.700
You are failing, Ororo. Give it more.
Give it everything you have.

16:00.550 --> 16:01.150
Heads up!

16:20.300 --> 16:21.600
Bobby!

16:32.600 --> 16:34.600
Keep going. They're all right.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.700
Stay behind us!

16:48.000 --> 16:51.600
Diamond? Would've been nice
to know you could do this.

16:51.850 --> 16:56.100
It's not my favourite form.
It prevents me from using my telepathy.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.300
There she is!

17:10.450 --> 17:12.500
-Shoot her down.
-Are you insane?

17:12.650 --> 17:14.970
It's her or Africa. You choose.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.300
Wait. Take a shot at me instead.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.900
-No!
-Storm! Listen to me!

17:46.500 --> 17:53.200
Storm, can you hear me? You've been deceived.
Fire is not what's destroying Africa. You are!

17:54.930 --> 17:56.400
You're doing it!

17:58.200 --> 18:00.050
Frost! What's happening?!

18:01.150 --> 18:07.550
Someone's invaded her mind. Shadow King.
He's made her believe Africa is burning.

18:10.770 --> 18:12.400
Trespasser!

18:14.200 --> 18:16.100
Can't you stop him?!

18:16.400 --> 18:20.250
No. He's much too powerful.
But she now knows the truth!

18:20.500 --> 18:21.700
-Let it go, Storm!
-No!

18:22.000 --> 18:24.600
It was all a lie!

18:51.000 --> 18:52.150
No!

18:56.700 --> 19:01.900
It's over, Shadow King! You used
her up! Her strength is gone!

19:02.250 --> 19:05.000
Then it will be you who finishes her!

19:07.150 --> 19:10.000
-Emma! What's happening?!
-He's exchanging bodies!

19:36.800 --> 19:41.200
Keep him out. He cannot survive without a host.

20:40.150 --> 20:41.170
No!

20:44.850 --> 20:48.300
Shame. And there's not a host body to be found.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.900
Ororo!

21:00.000 --> 21:01.900
No!

21:53.400 --> 21:56.000
It is difficult seeing him like this.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.000
But it kinda' helps knowing that he will wake up.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.150
Then we must ensure that when he does,
it is a future worth living in.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.150
So, you're staying?

22:05.800 --> 22:09.800
My place is here. Alongside my family.
