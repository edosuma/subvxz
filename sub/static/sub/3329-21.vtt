WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:03.127
My name is Alfredo,
and I'm an addict.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.762
(group greets Alfredo,
overlapping voices)

00:04.800 --> 00:08.668
(sighs) Wow, um... first time
I said those words,

00:08.700 --> 00:11.601
I was 33 and didn't think

00:11.640 --> 00:13.699
I'd make it to see 34.

00:13.740 --> 00:17.301
If you told me
then that I'd be

00:17.350 --> 00:19.147
getting my five-year chip now,

00:19.180 --> 00:21.614
I'd have thought
you were high. Honestly.

00:21.650 --> 00:22.719
(mild laughter)

00:22.750 --> 00:25.412
But... here I am.

00:25.450 --> 00:28.419
And it's because
of people In this room.

00:28.460 --> 00:31.588
You guys gave me
my life back.

00:31.630 --> 00:33.791
People like Libby... Tom...

00:33.830 --> 00:35.718
Sherlock.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.593
You_'re_the reason I made
It five years clean.

00:38.630 --> 00:41.337
And the reason that I got

00:41.370 --> 00:44.134
my sights set on ten.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.309
So thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:46.340 --> 00:48.729
(applause)

00:50.810 --> 00:53.449
(sighs)

00:54.320 --> 00:56.083
Right.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.314
Hi.

00:57.350 --> 00:58.510
Sherlock.

00:58.550 --> 00:59.619
Lloyd.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.651
Lloyd.

01:01.690 --> 01:04.579
So, uh, you make a habit

01:04.630 --> 01:06.791
of, uh, drinking
before the meetings?

01:06.830 --> 01:08.752
Excuse me?

01:08.800 --> 01:10.597
The-The mints, they're
not quite doing the trick.

01:10.630 --> 01:12.359
I can still smell the whiskey.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.630
And I did the last time I saw
you at a meeting.

01:14.670 --> 01:17.662
I... have not been drinking.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.405
No? And bringing
(metallic tapping)

01:19.440 --> 01:21.704
your flask into a meeting
is really sort of...

01:21.740 --> 01:23.708
it's bad form.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.719
I mean, you're either
lying to yourself

01:26.750 --> 01:28.741
or you're lying to everyone here
about your...

01:28.780 --> 01:30.748
your reasons
for being here.

01:30.790 --> 01:32.712
The hell's that
supposed to mean?

01:32.760 --> 01:35.388
Well, you know these
meetings are sometimes

01:35.420 --> 01:37.354
spied on by, uh...

01:37.390 --> 01:39.551
blackmailers, voyeurs,

01:39.600 --> 01:43.127
agents of attorneys.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.422
I come here for help.

01:45.470 --> 01:47.734
Same as you.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.761
Right. Okay.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.278
Well, as the fifth step says...

01:53.740 --> 01:55.276
start each day
on the right foot.

01:55.310 --> 01:56.743
Right.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.202
No. That's the slogan

01:58.250 --> 02:00.616
of the coffee
you're drinking.

02:00.650 --> 02:02.379
ALFREDO:
What's up, Sherlock?

02:02.420 --> 02:03.842
Oh, this is Lloyd.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.415
H_e's... _
He was Just leavmg.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.621
(siren wailing)
Just hang on, okay?

02:10.660 --> 02:12.651
We're almost at
the hospital.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.521
That should help with the pain.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.834
You're doing great.
Just breathe.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.703
(engine slows, stops)
(siren stops)

02:22.740 --> 02:24.799
See? We're here.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.478
You're gonna be fine.

02:26.510 --> 02:27.829
(gunshots in distance)

02:27.880 --> 02:29.848
(gasping):
What was that?

02:29.880 --> 02:31.404
(doors opening)

02:31.450 --> 02:32.678
MAN:
You!

02:32.720 --> 02:33.345
Get out!

02:33.380 --> 02:36.440
Now!

02:36.490 --> 02:40.312
EMT:
Please, don't shoot.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.783
(gunsh
ot
Aah! )

02:42.830 --> 02:44.821
(door closes)

02:51.300 --> 02:53.439
Please, I'm sick.

02:53.470 --> 02:54.732
Please let me go.

02:54.770 --> 02:57.307
(siren wailing)

02:59.410 --> 03:01.878
(siren wailing)

03:43.690 --> 03:45.419
Is there another angle?

03:45.450 --> 03:47.509
Sorry, no.
I can zoom in a little,

03:47.560 --> 03:49.983
but that's about it.
Just got off

03:50.030 --> 03:53.591
with the 911 operator that sent
the ambulance on its last call.

03:53.630 --> 03:56.269
Patient in the back
was a white female in her 205,

03:56.300 --> 03:57.699
fainted
outside a drugstore

03:57.730 --> 03:59.436
in Chelsea;
couple people saw it,

03:59.470 --> 04:01.495
called it in,
nobody got a name.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.734
It's a good bet
her purse

04:02.770 --> 04:04.931
and ID. are in
the vehicle with her.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.733
Still no sign of the ambulance?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.032
Nothing yet.
That footage is all we got.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.298
Let's remedy that, shall we?

04:11.350 --> 04:12.772
Can I have a paper clip?
Thanks.

04:20.820 --> 04:23.288
I think
it's your turn to ask.

04:23.330 --> 04:25.025
All good things...

04:27.530 --> 04:29.521
The longer we go
without a ransom call,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.788
greater chance this wasn't
about our missing woman.

04:31.830 --> 04:33.889
If there was _
some other prime motive--

04:33.940 --> 04:35.692
killing the paramedics,

04:35.740 --> 04:37.662
stealing an ambulance--
any way you add it up...

04:37.710 --> 04:39.632
That woman ends up
as collateral.

04:49.820 --> 04:50.809
Here we are.

04:50.850 --> 04:52.511
CSU missed a shell casing?

04:52.560 --> 04:54.778
Well, to be fair,

04:54.820 --> 04:56.356
so did the shooter.

04:56.390 --> 04:58.028
We saw from the video

04:58.060 --> 04:59.925
that he very assiduously
collected his shell casings.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.518
But there were three shots;

05:01.560 --> 05:03.869
he seemed to only pick up
two discards.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.767
This one must have rolled
completely out of reach,

05:06.800 --> 05:08.939
down that storm drain.

05:08.970 --> 05:11.803
Is it me, or is that casing
a little beat up?

05:11.840 --> 05:12.909
Indeed.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.476
The bulges in the brass

05:14.510 --> 05:15.829
and the stretch marks

05:15.880 --> 05:17.040
along the base indicate
that this shell casing's

05:17.080 --> 05:18.479
been used more than once.

05:18.510 --> 05:21.013
Oh. You can use a casing
more than once?

05:21.050 --> 05:23.939
It's a process
known as "hand-loading."

05:23.990 --> 05:25.719
Spent casings are refilled

05:25.750 --> 05:27.388
with primer powder and a slug

05:27.420 --> 05:28.910
and then fired again.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.086
Reusable bullets.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.428
HOLMES:
I suggest we look

05:32.460 --> 05:33.791
for other crimes committed with

05:33.830 --> 05:34.922
DIY ammunition.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.723
It might not be the first time

05:36.770 --> 05:38.624
he's shot at something
other than a target.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.092
This is crazy.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.937
I had no idea that reusing
casings was such a thing.

05:41.970 --> 05:44.962
Never underestimate _
mankind's passmn for rendering

05:45.010 --> 05:47.137
the tools of violence
and mayhem.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.808
That is the third time
you've looked out the window.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.874
Are you expecting someone?

05:50.910 --> 05:52.810
No.
No, not really.

05:52.850 --> 05:55.148
There's a slim possibility
I'm being surveilled.

05:55.180 --> 05:56.818
What?
At the meeting I
attended last night,

05:56.850 --> 05:58.909
I confronted a man
I believed to be spying.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.156
On you?

06:00.190 --> 06:01.953
Undetermined.

06:01.990 --> 06:03.685
That was the second meeting
in a row

06:03.730 --> 06:04.788
that he drew my attention

06:04.830 --> 06:06.650
and_each one was
at a different location.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.792
That doesn't prove

06:07.830 --> 06:09.127
that he was following
me, of course.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.798
But he was lying

06:10.830 --> 06:12.593
when he said
he was there to get help.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.868
That much was obvious.

06:13.900 --> 06:14.992
Should I be worried?

06:15.040 --> 06:17.406
Mmm.

06:17.440 --> 06:19.408
What is it?
Olivia Harris.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.169
20-year-old prostitute.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.440
Shot to death on Staten Island
last July.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.948
A presumed
trick gone wrong.

06:25.980 --> 06:27.868
Ballistics confirmed that
the ammunition used to kill her

06:27.920 --> 06:29.581
was hand-loaded.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.941
Just like the casing
from this morning.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.958
Police were ultimately unable
to identify her killer,

06:33.990 --> 06:35.810
though they did flag
several gun enthusiasts

06:35.860 --> 06:39.057
as persons of interest,
including this man.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.867
That's him.

06:44.900 --> 06:45.889
That's the shooter
from the hospital.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.034
His name is Wallace Turk.

06:48.070 --> 06:51.562
I don't know
what you want me to say.

06:51.610 --> 06:53.874
Some information about the woman
you abducted would be nice.

06:53.910 --> 06:55.070
Her name, for example.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.078
BELL:
You may have gotten away

06:57.110 --> 06:59.908
with killing Olivia Harris
last year,

06:59.950 --> 07:01.645
but we've got
blood-spattered clothing,

07:01.680 --> 07:02.988
taken from your trash,

07:03.020 --> 07:04.612
that I know is
gonna be a match

07:04.650 --> 07:05.981
for the two dead paramedics.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.089
We've got security footage

07:07.120 --> 07:08.815
that shows you
pulling the trigger.

07:08.860 --> 07:10.179
You're not doing
yourself any favors

07:10.230 --> 07:12.152
with the silent
treatment.

07:12.190 --> 07:13.794
Do you want to know
what happened

07:13.830 --> 07:15.525
to the woman in the back
of the ambulance?

07:15.560 --> 07:16.959
All right, fine.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.558
Two murders, three murders--

07:18.600 --> 07:19.828
I'm looking at life either way,

07:19.870 --> 07:21.167
right?

07:22.670 --> 07:23.705
I killed her.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.629
What did you do with the body?

07:28.680 --> 07:30.773
Don't remember.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.848
What's he doing?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.689
BELL:
I'm not gonna lie
to you, Mr. Turk.

07:36.720 --> 07:38.881
You'll be eating off a metal
plate until the day you die.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.013
He touched my shoe.

07:41.060 --> 07:42.687
You help us recover
the body of that woman

07:42.730 --> 07:44.482
and we'll put in a good word
with the DA.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.883
Maybe get you a window
at Sing Sing.

07:45.930 --> 07:48.228
Look, she can rot
where I left her.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.921
I'm not telling you
where she is.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.858
HOLMES:
You may already have.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.164
The treads in your boots
are laden with sand

07:54.200 --> 07:55.895
and bits of smooth cordgrass

07:55.940 --> 07:57.237
that are still moist.

07:57.270 --> 07:58.703
You've mucked about

07:58.740 --> 08:00.708
in an intertidal
salt marsh today.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.970
What are the odds that
we'll find her in or near one?

08:04.880 --> 08:05.904
What's that you say?

08:05.950 --> 08:07.144
One hundred percent?

08:07.180 --> 08:08.613
WATSON:
When we get the records

08:08.650 --> 08:09.981
for your cell phone,
are we gonna see

08:10.020 --> 08:11.612
that it pinged in the vicinity

08:11.650 --> 08:12.981
of any salt marshes today?

08:14.660 --> 08:17.754
That's idiot for "yes."

08:17.790 --> 08:19.997
(playing a march, off-key)

08:27.300 --> 08:29.268
Ghastly, wretched tune, no?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.904
I've always found Sousa

08:30.940 --> 08:32.976
the musical equivalent
of a leaf blower.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.834
What are you doing here?

08:35.880 --> 08:37.802
A hole opened up in my schedule,

08:37.850 --> 08:39.147
so I thought I'd go somewhere
I don't belong.

08:39.180 --> 08:40.317
That's fair,
isn't it,

08:40.350 --> 08:41.942
Mr. Anthony Sellers

08:41.980 --> 08:44.119
of 345 Rosalind Road?

08:44.150 --> 08:45.845
How did you find me?

08:45.890 --> 08:46.959
Next time you surveil someone,

08:46.990 --> 08:48.184
wear plainer clothes.

08:48.220 --> 08:49.824
They recognized you

08:49.860 --> 08:51.327
at the municipal golf course,

08:51.360 --> 08:52.896
whose logo you flaunted.

08:52.930 --> 08:54.795
You're a private detective

08:54.830 --> 08:55.990
and you've been
following me, no?

08:56.030 --> 08:57.725
No.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.795
The truth, "Lloyd."

08:59.840 --> 09:02.138
Or your son and his
friends will witness

09:02.170 --> 09:05.139
the very loud end
of our tragic love affair.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.933
Very well.

09:08.980 --> 09:11.107
I wasn't following you.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.617
Okay?

09:12.650 --> 09:14.641
It was your buddy.

09:14.680 --> 09:16.079
Llamosa.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.781
Alfredo?

09:17.820 --> 09:19.082
Yes.

09:22.390 --> 09:25.325
He's in a lot
of trouble.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.761
GREGSON:
So, what, he just...

09:36.810 --> 09:38.266
ditched the ambulance
out here in the open?

09:38.310 --> 09:41.108
BELL:
Unis found it about
30 minutes ago.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.608
No fire, no bleach...

09:43.650 --> 09:45.902
we ought to be able
to pull prints.

09:45.950 --> 09:48.111
Now, CSU's on their way.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.789
MLI, too.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.959
Her name is Maggie Halpern.

09:52.990 --> 09:53.979
ID. was in her purse,

09:54.020 --> 09:56.056
under the gurney.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.229
Killer didn't make any more
of an effort to hide who she was

09:58.260 --> 10:00.125
than he did to dispose
of the vehicle.

10:02.730 --> 10:04.095
GREGSON:
He gutted her.

10:04.130 --> 10:06.769
Right after he slashed
her throat.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.860
This was gonna be
found eventually.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.834
Why didn't Wallace Turk
just tell us where she was?

10:12.880 --> 10:15.235
Because I don't think
he's the one who killed her.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.804
He confessed.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.805
When I first got here,

10:17.850 --> 10:19.306
the body was still warm,

10:19.350 --> 10:21.716
most of the blood on the floor
hadn't even dried yet.

10:21.750 --> 10:25.015
We can wait for the coroner to
confirm, but ifI had to guess,

10:25.050 --> 10:28.281
I'd say she was killed
in the last couple hours.

10:28.320 --> 10:33.019
Wallace Turk has been in
custody since what? Noon?

10:33.060 --> 10:34.698
I think he left her here,

10:34.730 --> 10:37.324
and somebody else came
to finish the job.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.122
A partner?

10:39.170 --> 10:41.730
If I'm right,
that person's still out there.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.047
HOLMES: First measure of liver
temperature 35 degrees Celsius?

10:50.080 --> 10:53.140
BELL: And that ambulance
wasn't exactly an oven.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.011
She was probably alive
for about three hours

10:55.050 --> 10:56.847
after Wallace Turk
left her tied up.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.188
CSU found a pair of shoe prints

10:59.220 --> 11:00.710
in the sand near the ambulance.

11:00.760 --> 11:02.921
Turks and whoever
he's covering for.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.281
His partner is a leftie.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.094
Took a pretty savage swipe
at her carotid.

11:08.130 --> 11:09.722
That was the
cause of death.

11:09.770 --> 11:11.021
Everything else
came after.

11:12.170 --> 11:15.059
Well, this incision
is much more precise.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.431
He took his time.

11:16.470 --> 11:20.076
It seems strange
that he'd be so careful

11:20.110 --> 11:22.101
about inflicting one wound
and not the other, right?

11:22.140 --> 11:23.175
It gets stranger.

11:23.210 --> 11:24.302
She's missing a few organs.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.942
Gallbladder, right kidney,

11:25.980 --> 11:28.471
_ and_a section of
intestine-- all gone.

11:28.520 --> 11:30.886
Trophies?
I don't think so.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.285
Her internal_
wounds show Signs

11:32.320 --> 11:33.878
of scarring and
tissue regeneration.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.115
I even found sutures.
She was healing.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.821
Best guess?

11:37.860 --> 11:41.318
Everything was removed
a few days before her death.

11:41.360 --> 11:44.022
Kidneys go for upwards of
ten grand on the black market.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.732
Maybe we're looking at some sort
of botched organ harvesting.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.364
Where did this come from?
Tucked up under her lung.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.039
Figured it was part
of a surgical drape.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.231
No, it's not a drape.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.204
And I don't think Miss
Halpern sold her organs.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.970
I think she had them
removed to make room.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.942
What?

12:02.990 --> 12:04.389
This kind of polyethylene
plastic resin is used

12:04.420 --> 12:06.445
to wrap narcotics.

12:06.490 --> 12:08.219
I think she was a drug mule.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.818
BELL: Half of this
woman's insides are gone.

12:09.860 --> 12:12.328
I mean, if that were
true, that would be...

12:12.360 --> 12:14.055
Extreme dedication
to one's work.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.819
Or a desperate woman
hoping to make one big payday.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.088
It would explain why the
incision into her abdomen

12:19.130 --> 12:20.392
was done so delicately.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.998
The person who killed her...

12:22.040 --> 12:23.769
didn't want
to puncture the package.

12:23.810 --> 12:24.834
It would also explain
why Wallace Turk

12:24.870 --> 12:26.462
was so reluctant
to talk to us.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.171
He wasn't just protecting
his co-conspirator.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.303
He was protecting his score.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.806
He keeps his mouth shut,

12:31.850 --> 12:33.112
maybe someone he cares about
still gets paid.

12:33.150 --> 12:34.879
With your permission,
Detective, I would like

12:34.920 --> 12:36.410
to have another
conversation with Mr. Turk,

12:36.450 --> 12:38.509
and see if any of
this loosens his tongue.

12:38.550 --> 12:41.257
In the meantime, you and I
could take a closer look

12:41.290 --> 12:43.019
at Turk's other co-conspirator--

12:43.060 --> 12:45.779
Maggie Halpern.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.958
It doesn't make any sense.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.299
I lived with Maggie
for two years.

12:52.330 --> 12:53.866
She barely drinks.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.788
She doesn't smoke.

12:55.840 --> 12:59.435
I used_ to tease her about
the one time I saw her jaywalk.

12:59.470 --> 13:01.938
BELL:
It's natural to be upset.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.868
Maybe she wasn't the person
you thought she was.

13:03.910 --> 13:05.571
You don't understand.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.840
I'm saying you're wrong.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.438
WATSON: We know this
is hard to hear.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.084
We just want to make sure
whoever is responsible

13:11.120 --> 13:13.884
for Maggie's death pays
for what they did to her.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.411
You said she just returned
from a trip to Brazil.

13:16.460 --> 13:19.122
Do you know if it was
for business or pleasure?

13:19.160 --> 13:20.525
Neither.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.960
She had trouble with her weight.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.561
Paleo, South Beach, that
cayenne pepper cleanse thing.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.932
Nothing really worked.

13:28.970 --> 13:31.336
She went to Sao Paulo
for gastric bypass.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.870
It's a lot cheaper there.

13:34.910 --> 13:37.606
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

13:37.650 --> 13:40.244
The morning she left Brazil.

13:40.280 --> 13:42.373
She called from the airport.

13:42.420 --> 13:45.981
She was still in a little pain,
but... she sounded so happy;

13:46.020 --> 13:48.318
so hopeful.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.884
I wasn't here when
she got back.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.329
I had to work.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.454
(voice breaking):
Maybe if I hadn't...

13:54.500 --> 13:56.627
WATSON: Would you
like some water?

13:56.660 --> 13:59.595
Why don't you let us
get that for you?

13:59.630 --> 14:02.906
Okay.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.934
Gastric bypass was a
pretty good cover story.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.608
Maggie could explain away
the trip out of the country,

14:10.650 --> 14:13.915
any follow-up appointments,
any pain or cramping.

14:16.250 --> 14:20.186
What if she really did
book that surgery?

14:20.220 --> 14:22.927
Well, you looked at her
pretty closely at the morgue.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.086
If she had had
her stomach stapled,

14:24.130 --> 14:25.358
wouldn't you have noticed?

14:25.390 --> 14:26.652
She didn't.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.351
But what if she
believed she had?

14:28.400 --> 14:30.220
Look at the food in here.

14:31.430 --> 14:33.068
Strained cream soup,

14:33.100 --> 14:35.091
sugar-free gelatin, broth.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.665
These are all staples of
the gastric bypass diet.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.406
Why would she have these
in there, if she knew

14:40.440 --> 14:42.908
she wasn't actually
having the surgery?

14:42.950 --> 14:45.942
You think she didn't know
she was a drug mule.

14:47.650 --> 14:49.914
If killing your mule
is part of your plan,

14:49.950 --> 14:51.986
then why tell them
they're a mule at all?

14:52.020 --> 14:54.284
Maggie goes under for LAP-BAND,

14:54.320 --> 14:56.208
but gets turned into a
walking suitcase instead.

14:56.260 --> 14:59.252
She comes back to New York,
clears customs none the wiser.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.190
Only she gets
sick before Turk

15:01.230 --> 15:03.289
and his partner
could scoop her up.

15:03.330 --> 15:05.093
So they follow the ambulance
and then they kill

15:05.130 --> 15:06.620
the paramedics
before anyone can

15:06.670 --> 15:08.888
figure out
what's inside her.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.164
We should get back
to the precinct.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.973
If you're right,
there's a surgeon

15:14.010 --> 15:15.477
the Brazilian authorities
need to question.

15:15.510 --> 15:16.943
(sighs quietly)

15:18.980 --> 15:20.948
Well, it's official.

15:20.980 --> 15:25.019
Dr. Bruno Escanso
of Sao Paulo is missmg.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.154
I got a hold
of a Captain Otero there.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.714
He speaks English.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.183
He said that Escanso
operated on Maggie Halpern

15:31.230 --> 15:33.221
five days ago,

15:33.260 --> 15:34.955
and hasn't been seen since.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.558
He's
gone?

15:36.600 --> 15:37.999
Yeah.

15:38.030 --> 15:39.292
That's the BOLO the police

15:39.330 --> 15:41.298
put out to find him.

15:41.340 --> 15:43.308
It says here Dr. Escanso's
married to an American woman

15:43.340 --> 15:45.035
named Connie Turk.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.401
Any relation to Wallace Turk?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.702
GREGSON:
She's his sister.

15:47.740 --> 15:49.970
Explains how a creep
from Staten Island

15:50.010 --> 15:53.013
can partner up with
a surgeon in Brazil.

15:53.050 --> 15:54.415
Maybe Escanso's here.

15:54.450 --> 15:55.712
He's the one who sliced up
Maggie Halpern.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.217
It's possible,

15:57.250 --> 15:59.013
but his passport
hasn't been used.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.587
Either he laid hands
on a fake one or

16:01.620 --> 16:03.656
he's still somewhere in Brazil.

16:03.690 --> 16:05.157
HOLMES: Here's an
interesting tidbit:

16:05.190 --> 16:07.420
Little over a week ago,
40 pounds of diamorphine

16:07.460 --> 16:09.758
were stolen from the hospital
where Escanso operates.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.997
He became the prime suspect
after he disappeared.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.769
"Diamorphine"-- that's
medical-grade heroin.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.131
The purest of the pure.

16:16.170 --> 16:17.262
WATSON:
40 pounds.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.561
Even with a few organs missing,

16:18.610 --> 16:19.736
there's no way
that Maggie Halpern

16:19.770 --> 16:20.998
coul_d've been
carrying all of it.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.144
Maybe he sold some in Brazil?

16:23.180 --> 16:25.569
Or he had more than one mule.

16:25.610 --> 16:27.009
That would mean Maggie was not

16:27.050 --> 16:28.779
the only person that
the smugglers killed.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.481
GREGSON: I'll reach out
to Otero again,

16:30.520 --> 16:32.112
see if he can get us a list

16:32.150 --> 16:35.608
of Escanso's most
recent patients.

16:37.630 --> 16:40.349
If Escanso and his partners
did utilize extra mules,

16:40.400 --> 16:43.119
all 40 pounds of the diamorphine
could be in New York already.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.467
There's a happy thought.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.365
Well, if we can
locate the heroin,

16:46.400 --> 16:48.789
we might be able to find the
man who butchered Miss Halpern.

16:48.840 --> 16:51.104
Well, if it's here already,
it's as good as gone, isn't it?

16:51.140 --> 16:52.607
Not necessarily.

16:52.640 --> 16:55.177
40 pounds of concentrated
opiate can be cut

16:55.210 --> 16:57.770
and processed into 300 pounds
of street-grade horse.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.539
Now, even the largest
cartels lack the facilities

16:59.580 --> 17:01.673
to perform that kind
of alchemy overnight.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.417
It's hard to imagine Escanso and
Turk were working for a cartel.

17:05.450 --> 17:07.179
The big syndicates have
their own pipelines.

17:07.220 --> 17:09.108
They wouldn't waste time
planning a one-off score

17:09.160 --> 17:10.684
like this, with amateurs.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.686
Amateurs have to sell to
professmnals eventually.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.721
Well, the DEA should have
a list of cartels

17:14.760 --> 17:16.421
that can handle
that kind of weight.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.825
You two feel like
knocking on the doors

17:17.870 --> 17:20.134
of a few drug lords
this afternoon?

17:20.170 --> 17:22.161
Yes, I do indeed.
But I have to take care

17:22.200 --> 17:23.269
of some personal
business first.

17:27.680 --> 17:28.738
(pounding on door)

17:35.120 --> 17:37.145
I heard a rather interesting
story the other day,

17:37.190 --> 17:38.316
and I thought
you'd appreciate it.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.487
Hello to you, too.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.158
Apparently there's been a rash

17:41.190 --> 17:43.329
of high-end car thefts
around the city.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.828
Nice. Well, not "thefts" so much
as borrowings, I suppose.

17:45.860 --> 17:48.124
The perpetrator breaks
into the vehicles

17:48.160 --> 17:49.320
and then just moves them

17:49.360 --> 17:50.463
a short distance.

17:50.500 --> 17:51.626
Like from an owner's driveway

17:51.670 --> 17:53.262
to the street, for example.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.189
Or from one spot in
a parking garage to another.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.164
Now, one thing that all the
misplaced cars have in common

17:59.210 --> 18:00.837
is that they all have
the same security system--

18:00.880 --> 18:02.575
a Castle S-50.

18:02.610 --> 18:04.703
You consult for Castle
Automotive Systems, do you not?

18:04.750 --> 18:06.809
Nope. Not anymore.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.215
Oh, do tell.

18:08.250 --> 18:09.547
We had a difference of opinion,

18:09.580 --> 18:11.184
so we went our separate ways.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.359
You got into a shouting match
with their lead designer

18:13.390 --> 18:14.857
over his refusal
to address certain glitches

18:14.890 --> 18:16.858
you'd identified
and then you got sacked.

18:16.890 --> 18:19.723
Were you checking up on me?

18:19.760 --> 18:21.398
No.

18:21.430 --> 18:23.159
But others have been.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.896
The man I confronted
the other day-- Lloyd--

18:25.930 --> 18:28.398
he was hired by Castle
to surveil you.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.862
What?

18:29.900 --> 18:31.538
They believe that
you're the one

18:31.570 --> 18:33.128
moving their
clients' cars around.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.579
And now...

18:34.610 --> 18:36.771
so do I.

18:40.280 --> 18:42.441
Why are you doing it?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.619
And don't tell me_ it's
'cause you got terminated.

18:44.650 --> 18:46.743
In my youth, I was dismissed
from multiple posts.

18:46.790 --> 18:48.883
Being ousted for
insubordination

18:48.920 --> 18:51.252
to a mental incompetent
is its own reward.

18:51.290 --> 18:52.587
I wasn't just fired, okay?

18:52.630 --> 18:54.598
They bad-mouthed me
to my other clients.

18:54.630 --> 18:56.598
You got the thickest skin
I've ever come across.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.598
They said I was using.

18:58.630 --> 19:00.359
Okay?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.265
Sorry, but I can't
let that slide.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.608
Not after everything
I've been through.

19:03.640 --> 19:04.766
All the work I've done?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.437
No way.

19:06.470 --> 19:07.835
You got a record.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.529
If you'd have been caught...

19:09.580 --> 19:11.502
They're not gonna catch me.
Oh, so you've got

19:11.550 --> 19:13.245
more pranks in store, do you?

19:14.550 --> 19:17.246
So, how long you gonna
stay sober in prison?

19:19.990 --> 19:21.514
Are you my friend, Sherlock?

19:21.560 --> 19:22.788
Yes, I'm your friend.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.687
No, you're not.

19:25.730 --> 19:28.654
You're an addict,
I'm your sponsor-- that's it.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.895
That's how it's
supposed to be.

19:30.930 --> 19:33.296
For your own good.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.830
Now, you want to come in here

19:34.870 --> 19:36.235
because you're afraid
you might use?

19:36.270 --> 19:38.204
My door is open.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.969
You want to call me
in the middle of the night?

19:40.010 --> 19:42.205
I will never
not pick up that phone.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.741
But this thing
between Castle and me...

19:43.780 --> 19:45.668
is none of your damn business.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.678
So stay out of it.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.945
WOMAN:
I'm sorry, sir,

19:50.990 --> 19:53.811
but I told you there's
no one here by that name.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.317
Is everything okay here?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.555
Dr. Ward, I'm Detective Bell.

19:58.590 --> 19:59.989
This is my colleague
Joan Watson.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.590
We're here to see
Janko Stepovic.

20:02.630 --> 20:04.962
I'm sorry, but there's
nobody here by that name.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.558
WATSON:
Presently, no.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.568
He has a_ Serbian heroin
syndicate to run.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.603
_He can't conduct all _
of his busmess in your office.

20:13.340 --> 20:16.309
That's crazy.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.547
But I know where you may
have gotten that idea from.

20:18.580 --> 20:22.277
The, uh, the DEA were
up here last month,

20:22.320 --> 20:24.538
and, um, they were
confused, too.

20:24.590 --> 20:25.545
There's no confusion.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.012
Janko's smart.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.416
He knows doctor-patient
confidentiality prohibits

20:29.460 --> 20:31.849
authorities from planting bugs
in medical offices.

20:31.890 --> 20:34.290
Now, I don't know what you get
out of the arrangement,

20:34.330 --> 20:36.548
but there's a stack of
surveillance photos this thick

20:36.600 --> 20:39.398
of Serbian gangsters
strolling in and out of here.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.637
So don't lie to us again.

20:46.770 --> 20:49.739
None of this was my idea.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.340
One day, I am cleaning
this guy's teeth,

20:52.380 --> 20:56.339
and the next, all of
his people are just...

20:56.380 --> 20:57.278
they're just here.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.288
We're not here about you.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.481
We want to talk to Janko.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.023
He might be able to help us
find a killer-- that's it.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.992
Janko, this is Detective...

21:11.030 --> 21:12.429
Get out.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.675
I prefer police contact me
through my lavwer,

21:22.710 --> 21:24.348
not my dentist.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.507
We're just here
to exchange information.

21:26.550 --> 21:28.017
About?

21:28.050 --> 21:30.848
Almost 20 kilos of
medical-grade heroin

21:30.890 --> 21:32.039
smuggled in from Brazil.

21:32.090 --> 21:34.058
People who did it look
to be free agents.

21:34.090 --> 21:36.081
Given the amount, there's
a pretty short list

21:36.120 --> 21:37.553
of buyers who make sense.

21:37.590 --> 21:40.491
I don't buy drugs.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.088
Maybe not personally,

21:42.130 --> 21:43.927
but your syndicate sources
all of its product

21:43.970 --> 21:45.824
from the Helmand
Province of Afghanistan.

21:45.870 --> 21:47.667
There was a tough
drought there

21:47.700 --> 21:49.338
during the growing
season last year.

21:49.370 --> 21:50.769
It hit you hard.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.779
DEA says you guys are
running light on supply.

21:53.810 --> 21:55.778
Other cartels could smell
blood in the water.

21:55.810 --> 21:58.938
It's pretty easy to see why you
might be interested in a re-up.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.777
I suppose...

22:00.820 --> 22:02.617
if all that was true.

22:02.650 --> 22:04.117
And if I sold heroin,

22:04.150 --> 22:05.617
as opposed to running
construction business.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.015
BELL:
Come on.

22:07.050 --> 22:08.859
We didn't insult
your intelligence.

22:08.890 --> 22:10.653
Don't insult ours.

22:10.690 --> 22:11.987
We're here because
the smugglers killed

22:12.030 --> 22:13.657
a young woman named
Maggie Halpern.

22:13.700 --> 22:17.659
Now, if any of their heroin
winds up in your hands,

22:17.700 --> 22:21.090
the NYPD is gonna devote
all of their resources

22:21.140 --> 22:22.960
to tying her murder
to you, Janko.

22:24.070 --> 22:24.968
We done here?

22:25.010 --> 22:26.102
BELL:
No.

22:26.140 --> 22:28.108
I haven't asked
for your help, yet.

22:28.140 --> 22:29.778
We could make it
worth your while.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.971
There's no way this
much heroin lands

22:32.010 --> 22:34.808
in New York without you
hearing about it.

22:34.850 --> 22:37.011
Help us find it,
and you can keep it

22:37.050 --> 22:39.109
out of the hands
of your rivals.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.118
You're weak-- the last
thing you need is

22:41.160 --> 22:43.378
a competitor scoring a
load of high-end product.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.355
You help us,
you help yourself.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.477
What's going on in here?

23:05.510 --> 23:06.909
I had some time,

23:06.950 --> 23:08.508
so I thought I would
revisit a mystery

23:08.550 --> 23:09.949
that has always
vexed me--

23:09.980 --> 23:11.982
the true meaning of
the Voynich Manuscript.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.815
What language
is this?
Unknown.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.418
As are the
speCIes of plants

23:17.460 --> 23:19.428
that the author drew
so meticulously

23:19.460 --> 23:22.452
at the dawn of
the 15th century.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.094
Some people believe that the
book is extra-terrestrial

23:25.130 --> 23:26.461
in its origin.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.138
I am not one of them.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.498
WATSON:
And Clyde is helping?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.531
Not really.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.935
I thought you'd be in Ozone Park
with Bell and the captain,

23:35.980 --> 23:37.607
enjoying the fruits
of your labors.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.517
(sighs)
You heard, huh?

23:40.550 --> 23:42.939
Janko Stepovic admitted
that our smuggler made contact

23:42.980 --> 23:44.641
with him
several days ago

23:44.690 --> 23:46.646
and then used an e-mail address

23:46.690 --> 23:49.488
to set up a meeting tonight.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.522
I must commend you
and the detective

23:51.560 --> 23:53.528
on your powers of persuasion.
We'll see.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.824
I don't know, maybe I'm being
unfair to Serbian drug lords,

23:55.860 --> 23:58.465
but I'm_a little nervous about
the sting Narcotics set up.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.229
I keep checking
my watch.

24:00.270 --> 24:01.828
You know, this may be
our only shot

24:01.870 --> 24:03.838
at picking up
Maggie Halpern's killer.

24:03.870 --> 24:05.235
Well, your food's
already in a bag,

24:05.270 --> 24:07.067
so why not join
the stakeout?

24:07.110 --> 24:08.998
I have plenty of
diversions and company.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.978
So how did your errand go
this afternoon?

24:14.020 --> 24:16.011
Poody.

24:16.050 --> 24:18.041
Do you want to talk about it?

24:18.090 --> 24:20.581
I have some concerns
over personal deCI5ions

24:20.620 --> 24:22.884
that an associate of mine
has made, and I told him so.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.888
Okay.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.249
He reminded me that
we're not friends,

24:26.290 --> 24:28.520
and he asked that I restrict
my concerns to those

24:28.560 --> 24:30.994
that fall within the stated_
parameters of our relationship.

24:31.030 --> 24:33.225
Did that seem
unreasonable to you?

24:33.270 --> 24:34.931
In fact, I know
that it is not.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.858
Then what's the problem?

24:36.900 --> 24:39.562
That's what I'm
trying to determine.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.601
(cell phone rings)

24:46.580 --> 24:48.548
Tell me the smuggler
took the bait.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.172
He never showed.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.188
Neither did Janko.

24:52.220 --> 24:54.780
I was afraid
we couldn't trust him.

24:54.820 --> 24:58.620
Yeah, well, I don't think you're
the only one who felt that way.

24:58.660 --> 25:02.619
Janko was shot outside a house
in Ditmas Park tonight.

25:02.660 --> 25:04.719
He's dead.

25:14.740 --> 25:16.537
What do you think they
were doing out here?

25:16.580 --> 25:17.945
I mean, this neighborhood
is pretty vanilla

25:17.980 --> 25:19.174
for a cartel shooting.

25:19.210 --> 25:21.178
It's just right for
run-of-the-mill adultery.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.314
Mr. Stepovic fairly reeks
of inexpensive eau de parfum.

25:24.350 --> 25:26.910
I imagine it was not
originally applied to him,

25:26.950 --> 25:28.053
but to his mistress.

25:28.090 --> 25:30.058
You might want to keep
your voice down.

25:30.090 --> 25:32.251
That's her standing
right over there.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.099
Her name is
Trisha Dolan.

25:34.130 --> 25:37.793
She says that's Janko's
bodyguard, Neno Milic.

25:37.830 --> 25:40.799
They came for a visit, got hit
on the way out to the car.

25:40.840 --> 25:44.731
She heard shots, called 911,
never saw the shooters.

25:44.770 --> 25:46.237
There was more than one?

25:46.270 --> 25:49.000
Janko was hit in the chest
by a nine millimeter,

25:49.040 --> 25:51.008
in the legs by a .45.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.814
Mr. Milic was also hit
by a .45-caliber weapon,

25:53.850 --> 25:55.613
but at a more acute angle.

25:55.650 --> 25:57.049
Yeah, that was
our take, too.

25:57.080 --> 25:58.581
Ambush.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.110
So Janko gives us
the person or people

26:00.150 --> 26:01.651
who killed Maggie Halpern.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.112
He doesn't show up to the sting,

26:03.160 --> 26:04.957
and now he and his bodyguard
are dead.

26:04.990 --> 26:07.629
Did they realize something
was up, track him down?

26:07.660 --> 26:09.252
Well, the timing is
highly suspicious.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.860
I imagine Mr. Stepovic is
a difficult man to track down,

26:11.900 --> 26:13.697
especially to the home
of his girlfriend.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.162
More especially
by the amateurs

26:15.200 --> 26:16.997
that we suspect
our smugglers to be.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.304
I think it's more likely that he
was killed by a rival syndicate

26:19.340 --> 26:21.137
or a traitor within his own.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.738
I would propose Miss Dolan

26:22.780 --> 26:24.748
as the quisling,

26:24.780 --> 26:26.304
but her shock and grief
appear to be genuine.

26:26.350 --> 26:28.318
Well, you guys stay
on the Halpern thing.

26:28.350 --> 26:30.910
We'll beat the bushes, see if
there's any word on the street

26:30.950 --> 26:32.144
about who hit these two.

26:32.190 --> 26:35.250
Any luck,
we'll meet in the middle.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.180
(cell phone chimes)

26:56.040 --> 26:57.849
WOMAN :
Detective Bell.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.245
Sarah Penley.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.077
I'm an attorney with
Braun, McMahon and Gould.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.314
What can I do for you?

27:02.350 --> 27:04.113
We should talk
someplace private.

27:04.150 --> 27:07.950
I believe you know
my client, Dr. Ward.

27:07.990 --> 27:11.153
I know who killed
Janko Stepovic.

27:11.190 --> 27:15.149
I know because
I helped them do it.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.656
Before we go any further,

27:16.700 --> 27:18.918
has Dr. Ward been
advised of his rights?

27:18.970 --> 27:21.291
He has, but this isn't
a confession.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.264
A confession implies guilt.

27:24.310 --> 27:28.098
Dr. Ward bears no culpability
for the crime he's reporting.

27:28.140 --> 27:29.232
He's a victim.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.771
For the past 18 months,

27:31.810 --> 27:33.778
he's been bullied, coerced
and strong-armed

27:33.820 --> 27:36.675
by Janko Stepovic
and members of his cartel.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.143
They forced him
to let them use his office

27:39.190 --> 27:40.339
to conduct their business.

27:40.390 --> 27:43.689
He relented because
he feared for his life.

27:43.730 --> 27:46.119
But after what happened
last night,

27:46.160 --> 27:48.697
he's no longer willing
to stay quiet.

27:48.730 --> 27:50.960
The Serbians did that to you?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.399
PENLEY: Actually,
they didn't.

27:52.430 --> 27:54.398
Members of
a Chinese cartel,

27:54.440 --> 27:56.067
_ Janko'_s rivals
in the her0in busmess,

27:56.100 --> 27:58.807
came to Dr. Ward's
office last night.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.432
They started
cutting off fingers

28:00.470 --> 28:02.904
until Marty told them
where Janko could be found,

28:02.940 --> 28:04.771
where he'd be vulnerable.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.779
I knew he was seeing one
of my patients, Trisha Dolan.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.219
They met in my office.

28:09.250 --> 28:12.014
You have to keep
my client safe.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.018
Your client is gonna
have to tell us

28:14.060 --> 28:16.016
a lot more about
the Serbians

28:16.060 --> 28:18.881
before witness protection
is on the table.

28:18.930 --> 28:22.024
Racketeering,
drug trafficking, murder.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.096
Take your pick.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.223
But first, I need
a guarantee in writing

28:26.270 --> 28:27.737
that Dr. Ward will receive

28:27.770 --> 28:30.330
both protective custody
and legal immunity

28:30.370 --> 28:32.907
before he says a word.

28:32.940 --> 28:34.874
I'm sure you're aware the DA
doesn't give out immunity

28:34.910 --> 28:36.901
to anybody who
tells a good story.

28:36.940 --> 28:38.908
Dr. Ward would have
to demonstrate

28:38.950 --> 28:40.508
that his information
is good before...

28:40.550 --> 28:43.144
How about the location
of two dead bodies?

28:47.050 --> 28:49.848
Yesterday, you said you
were looking for a killer,

28:49.890 --> 28:51.778
someone who hid drugs

28:51.830 --> 28:54.355
inside of a woman...
and gutted her.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.197
Maggie Halpern.

28:56.230 --> 28:57.424
I couldn't tell
you then,

28:57.460 --> 28:59.394
but you were
in the right place.

28:59.430 --> 29:01.239
It was all Janko's idea--

29:01.270 --> 29:05.138
the smuggling, the surgery
patients, the whole thing.

29:05.170 --> 29:09.334
Sometimes, when he and his men
would take over my exam rooms,

29:09.380 --> 29:11.348
I would listen
through the air vents.

29:11.380 --> 29:14.975
A few weeks ago, I heard him
talking about this guy, Turk.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.318
He was the one who floated
the whole smuggling thing.

29:17.350 --> 29:20.319
Turk had a friend,
a doctor, in Brazil--

29:20.350 --> 29:22.955
Escanso, I think
his name was--

29:22.990 --> 29:26.448
who could get his hands
on medical-grade heroin

29:26.490 --> 29:29.857
and hide it inside
of his patients.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.868
This woman you're
talking about, Maggie,

29:31.900 --> 29:34.368
she wasn't the first person
they did it to.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.868
She was the third.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.903
GREGSON: He was right
about the two other victims.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.976
He said their bodies were
dumped in a pond over the hill

29:42.010 --> 29:44.570
from where Wallace Turk
left the ambulance.

29:44.610 --> 29:47.545
Scuba team pulled them
up a little while ago.

29:47.580 --> 29:50.549
Do we know who they were?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.389
No official I.D.'s, yet,

29:52.420 --> 29:54.388
but we have a
pretty good hunch.

29:54.420 --> 29:56.854
Hector Trujo
and Missy Osborne.

29:56.890 --> 29:59.256
Both were reported
missing late last week,

29:59.290 --> 30:01.497
Both just got back
from trips from Brazil.

30:01.530 --> 30:02.895
And their families confirmed

30:02.930 --> 30:04.591
they were patients
of Bruno Escanso.

30:04.630 --> 30:06.564
GREGSON: And Ward says
he can't be sure,

30:06.600 --> 30:08.363
but he thinks Escanso

30:08.400 --> 30:10.095
did make it here to the States.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.937
If he did, you got to figure

30:11.970 --> 30:14.006
he's the one who cut up
Maggie Halpern.

30:15.110 --> 30:16.077
No Holmes today?

30:16.110 --> 30:18.101
No, he had a late night.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.947
Doesn't he always?

30:19.980 --> 30:21.447
Do you think it's weird

30:21.480 --> 30:23.983
that the killer was careful
in disposmg of these two,

30:24.020 --> 30:25.214
but not Maggie?

30:25.250 --> 30:27.013
Well, he didn't have time
with her.

30:27.050 --> 30:29.052
Wallace Turk had just shot
two paramedics,

30:29.090 --> 30:31.126
and half the city was looking
for their ambulance.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.129
Does Ward know
where we can find Escanso?

30:34.160 --> 30:36.048
GREGSON:
No, but once his deal

30:36.100 --> 30:38.091
is hammered out,
he's gonna tell us

30:38.130 --> 30:41.099
about every other facet
of the Serbians' operation.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.461
We'll start making arrests.

30:43.500 --> 30:45.559
Any luck,
one of Janko's lieutenants

30:45.610 --> 30:47.464
will point us
in the right direction.

30:47.510 --> 30:51.241
SHERLOCK: Leave a message
and then destroy this number.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.077
ALFREDO:
It's me again.

30:53.110 --> 30:54.975
Not showing up for the meeting
last night is one thing,

30:55.020 --> 30:56.442
but not returning my calls
is another.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.118
I stopped by your place.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.481
Nobody answered the door,
so call me.

30:59.520 --> 31:01.249
Let me know everything's
all right.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.478
Alfredo Llamosa?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.350
I'm Detective Nash.

31:07.390 --> 31:09.199
This is Detective Bailey.

31:09.230 --> 31:11.061
We were wondering if we could
ask you a few questions.

31:11.100 --> 31:12.499
Sure.

31:12.530 --> 31:15.090
You familiar with Faber Park
on 85th and Madison?

31:15.140 --> 31:17.392
No. Why?

31:17.440 --> 31:19.067
It's got one
of those elevator lifts,

31:19.110 --> 31:20.509
the kind they use
for stacking cars.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.974
Last night someone stole
12 different high-end vehicles

31:23.010 --> 31:24.375
from around the city,

31:24.410 --> 31:25.547
filled the whole damn thing.

31:25.580 --> 31:26.649
What?

31:26.680 --> 31:28.409
Total value of the vehicles

31:28.450 --> 31:31.089
is over seven figures.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.542
Frankly, I'm surprised
you hadn't heard about it.

31:32.590 --> 31:33.648
It's been in all the papers.

31:33.690 --> 31:36.011
My kid tells me it's trending.

31:36.060 --> 31:37.379
All 12 cars

31:37.420 --> 31:40.150
had an alarm system made
by a company called Castle.

31:40.190 --> 31:43.967
As I'm sure you can imagine,
they're having a rough morning.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.093
They think you're the reason.

31:46.130 --> 31:48.132
They think I did this?

31:48.170 --> 31:50.035
Can you account
for your whereabouts

31:50.070 --> 31:53.107
between 9:00 pm.
and midnight last night?

31:56.710 --> 31:58.075
Mr. Llamosa?

32:00.410 --> 32:03.208
I was going to meet a friend
at a support group meeting.

32:03.250 --> 32:05.480
110 West 138th Street.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.408
When he didn't show,
I went across the street

32:07.450 --> 32:09.315
to wait for him
at a coffee shop.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.123
We go there,
show your picture around,

32:11.160 --> 32:12.081
they gonna remember you?

32:12.130 --> 32:13.654
They should.

32:13.690 --> 32:16.056
Oh, and just in case,
check with the MTA, too.

32:16.100 --> 32:18.159
I had to take four different
busses just to get there.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.225
I'm sure I'll show up
on those cameras.

32:21.470 --> 32:22.960
We'll start with them.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.501
Any luck,
the footage backs you up.

32:24.540 --> 32:27.065
It will.

32:30.110 --> 32:32.101
Course it will.

32:33.150 --> 32:35.072
(elevator bell dings)

32:38.250 --> 32:40.184
I didn't realize
you were gonna be here.

32:40.220 --> 32:42.211
Hawes informed me the bodies
of the two remaining mules

32:42.260 --> 32:43.682
had been found.

32:43.720 --> 32:45.529
He'll be issuing
his reports momentarily.

32:45.560 --> 32:48.324
Looks like the only thing
Dr. Ward was wrong about

32:48.360 --> 32:50.351
was Bruno Escanso
being in New York.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.198
The captain heard from his
counterpart in Sao Paulo again.

32:53.230 --> 32:55.994
The police there had a near miss
with Escanso last night.

32:56.040 --> 32:58.167
He reached out to his wife;
they traced the call to a hotel

32:58.210 --> 32:59.666
just outside the city.

32:59.710 --> 33:02.076
Apparently,
they missed him by minutes.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.634
Here you go,
hot off the presses.

33:03.680 --> 33:06.001
There are discrepancies
between these two victims

33:06.050 --> 33:07.074
and Maggie Halpern.
Yeah.

33:07.110 --> 33:08.145
A couple things.

33:08.180 --> 33:09.613
Uh, in Miss Halpern's case,

33:09.650 --> 33:12.210
the killer removed the drugs
and left her open.

33:12.250 --> 33:13.182
Not so with these two.

33:13.220 --> 33:14.118
To sink the bodies,
he filled their torsos

33:14.160 --> 33:15.718
with rocks and then
sewed them back up.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.580
Guy wasn't half bad.

33:19.630 --> 33:23.020
Tight needlework,
consistent spacing.

33:23.060 --> 33:25.119
Based on the quality
of this stitching,

33:25.170 --> 33:27.798
I'd say your killer is somebody
with surgical experience.

33:27.830 --> 33:29.468
Obviously not Escanso.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.331
He never left Brazil.

33:31.370 --> 33:33.304
When I reached out to the DEA
the other day,

33:33.340 --> 33:35.501
they said some of the guys in
Janko's crew were ex-military.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.768
Maybe one of them
was a medic.

33:36.810 --> 33:39.040
WATSON: No, I don't
think that's it.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.809
I think Hawes is right.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.772
A surgeon did this,

33:42.820 --> 33:44.481
and we may already know
who it is.

33:45.790 --> 33:48.782
Normally, if you're closing
an external wound,

33:48.820 --> 33:51.789
you use monofilament nylon
or polydioxanone.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.492
These sutures are multifilament,

33:54.530 --> 33:56.657
made of polyglycolic acid,

33:56.700 --> 33:58.691
which_ is _
for more senSItive tissue.

33:58.730 --> 34:01.528
They're used in pediatrics,
urology and oral surgery.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.197
BEL_L:
Wait.

34:03.240 --> 34:06.403
Are you saying you think
Dr. Ward did this?

34:06.440 --> 34:07.737
If he did,
it was quite brilliant

34:07.770 --> 34:09.431
to strike a deal with _
the district attorney's office.

34:09.480 --> 34:13.109
So, if Watson's right,
if he is responsible for this,

34:13.150 --> 34:15.243
he's about to get away
with three murders.

34:22.160 --> 34:24.526
(elevator bell dings)

34:24.560 --> 34:26.425
Dr. Ward, Ms. Penley,

34:26.460 --> 34:27.552
thanks for coming back in.

34:27.590 --> 34:28.522
I'm sorry we're late.

34:28.560 --> 34:29.527
It's been a busy morning.

34:29.560 --> 34:31.869
A lot of prosecutors lining up
for depositions.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.492
Oh, I can imagine.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.260
There was, uh, something
we wanted to show you.

34:39.440 --> 34:41.328
SARAH:
What's that?

34:41.380 --> 34:43.336
WATSON: That is Dr. Ward's
undergraduate yearbook

34:43.380 --> 34:45.405
from the University
of Manhattan.

34:45.450 --> 34:47.338
We borrowed a copy
this morning.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.369
You had great hair

34:48.420 --> 34:50.115
and a freshman roommate

34:50.150 --> 34:52.414
named Bruno Escanso.

34:52.450 --> 34:53.542
BELL: The smuggling plot
was your idea,

34:53.590 --> 34:54.557
not Janko's.

34:54.590 --> 34:55.818
Excuse me?

34:55.860 --> 34:57.316
You had your old college buddy

34:57.360 --> 34:58.759
schedule three New York patients

34:58.790 --> 35:01.293
as close as he could,
and then stuff them full

35:01.330 --> 35:02.422
of the diamorphine
he stole.

35:02.460 --> 35:04.291
WATSON: Bruno's
brother-in-law, Wallace,

35:04.330 --> 35:06.161
was willing to kidnap
the patients for a price,

35:06.200 --> 35:07.792
but the real dirty work
was done by you.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.637
You shouldn't have
signed it.

35:12.370 --> 35:13.803
We took that_ _
from one of your Victims.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.376
It comes from your office, no?

35:15.410 --> 35:17.435
PENLEY: Marty, you don't have
to answer that.

35:17.480 --> 35:19.141
You misrepresented

35:19.180 --> 35:20.306
what this meeting was.

35:20.350 --> 35:21.476
This is outrageous.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.669
HOLMES:
On that we quite agree.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.347
Your client knew that

35:24.390 --> 35:25.743
his Serbian suitemates
would pay top dollar

35:25.790 --> 35:27.644
for heroin, and he went
to horrific lengths

35:27.690 --> 35:28.816
to meet their needs.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.181
BELL: It was all going
pretty well,

35:31.230 --> 35:32.356
but then the mess
Wallace Turk made

35:32.390 --> 35:34.199
brought us to Janko's door

35:34.230 --> 35:36.198
and scotched any chance you had
of selling to him.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.369
So you tried to sell
to the Triads instead.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.368
What? No.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.539
They cut off my fingers.

35:42.570 --> 35:43.867
You think I went to them?

35:43.900 --> 35:44.867
We know that you did.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.537
And frankly, it's a miracle

35:46.570 --> 35:48.470
that you kept your thumbs.

35:48.510 --> 35:49.670
You're bad at this, Marty.

35:49.710 --> 35:51.371
You're exceptionally bad.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.401
You think that an outfit
as ruthless as a Triad

35:53.450 --> 35:55.179
was gonna pay you
millions of dollars

35:55.220 --> 35:57.518
when they could just easily
lop off your digits instead.

35:57.550 --> 35:58.847
Wallace Turk was keeping

35:58.890 --> 36:01.211
his mouth shut, but that was
only because he thought

36:01.260 --> 36:02.887
there was still a payday
to be had.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.286
But you knew that, once he
realized the drugs were gone,

36:05.330 --> 36:07.628
he was gonna sell you out,
so you beat him to the punch.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.389
Once you had immunity,

36:09.430 --> 36:10.692
it wouldn't matter
what he said.

36:10.730 --> 36:12.459
You would be untouchable.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.229
In case you somehow missed
the point,

36:14.270 --> 36:16.329
there's no honor among thieves.

36:16.370 --> 36:19.168
Look over my shoulder.

36:20.370 --> 36:22.600
First Triad we pulled
off the street

36:22.640 --> 36:23.971
gave you up.

36:24.010 --> 36:26.570
GREGSON:
You come clean now,

36:26.610 --> 36:28.976
you testify
against both syndicates,

36:29.020 --> 36:32.786
and we can petition the judge to
keep you in isolation in prison.

36:32.820 --> 36:35.653
No one will be able
to lay hands on you.

36:35.690 --> 36:36.918
This meeting is over.

36:36.960 --> 36:39.349
Marty?

36:39.390 --> 36:42.325
Uh, I-I-I-I need to think.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.462
That guy out there,

36:44.500 --> 36:46.320
he's probably a cop.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.826
This, they can't use it.

36:47.870 --> 36:49.565
Physical evidence discovered

36:49.600 --> 36:52.307
as a result of your testimony
is inadmissible.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.637
They want to scare you
into saying something

36:53.670 --> 36:54.637
that's not covered.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.375
Martin, you should stay.

36:56.410 --> 36:57.502
You're not gonna hear this offer
a second time.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.371
It's not an offer; it's a trick.

36:59.410 --> 37:01.617
You won't last a day in prison
without our help.

37:01.650 --> 37:03.470
You know that, right?

37:03.520 --> 37:04.680
_ PENLEY: _
He isn't gomg to prison.

37:04.720 --> 37:06.244
I did it.

37:10.060 --> 37:11.721
I di... I did it.

37:13.730 --> 37:16.893
Everything they just said, I...

37:16.930 --> 37:19.262
It was my idea.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.597
All of it.

37:20.630 --> 37:21.938
Marty...
No, no.

37:21.970 --> 37:23.437
They're right.

37:23.470 --> 37:24.607
I am bad at this.

37:26.610 --> 37:29.602
Tell me what you want me to do.

37:37.520 --> 37:38.441
I didn't like hurting

37:38.490 --> 37:40.913
those people.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.428
If there had been
any other way...

37:44.460 --> 37:47.520
You should put that in there.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.006
This is Detective Yi.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.814
He's gonna be printing you
and processing your arrest.

38:28.540 --> 38:28.995
(doorbell rings)

38:31.440 --> 38:32.634
Explain.

38:32.670 --> 38:34.604
It's a newspaper;
there's news in it.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.631
Explain this.

38:41.750 --> 38:44.617
Your slanderershave been
utterly humiliated.

38:44.650 --> 38:46.379
I thought you'd be pleased.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.546
Iam.

38:47.590 --> 38:49.455
So what's the problem?

38:49.490 --> 38:51.082
I told you to stay out of it.

38:51.120 --> 38:54.396
Because we are sponsor
and sponsee and nothing more.

38:54.430 --> 38:55.727
Right.
Yeah, well,

38:55.760 --> 38:58.024
I thought long and hard
about that, Alfredo,

38:58.060 --> 38:59.664
and after many, many hours,

38:59.700 --> 39:01.759
I've come to the most wretched
of realizations,

39:01.800 --> 39:04.667
one that might curdle
your very blood.

39:05.710 --> 39:07.564
You are my friend.

39:07.610 --> 39:08.929
Sherlock... I know that's not

39:08.980 --> 39:10.572
necessarily
in my best interests.

39:10.610 --> 39:12.601
I'm not supposed to allow
my concerns for you

39:12.650 --> 39:14.572
to interfere with my quest
for sobriety.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.508
And you don't want the lines

39:16.550 --> 39:18.142
between sponsorship and
friendship to continue to blur.

39:18.180 --> 39:20.114
So I've arrived at a solution.

39:20.150 --> 39:21.856
I'm firing you.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.118
What?

39:23.160 --> 39:24.479
You're sacked.

39:24.530 --> 39:25.622
You're terminated.

39:25.660 --> 39:28.493
Unlike Castle,
I will not defame you,

39:28.530 --> 39:31.522
but suffice it to say
you're no longer my sponsor.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.698
I've grown quite fond of you
the past couple years.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.709
I care about what happens to you
outside of the program,

39:38.740 --> 39:40.799
and I reject the notion that
I can't offer my commentary

39:40.840 --> 39:41.977
when I believe

39:42.010 --> 39:43.978
you're making a mistake.

39:44.010 --> 39:46.399
You're firing me
so you can be my friend?

39:46.450 --> 39:47.849
Yeah.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.973
So you're gonna go
sponsorless now?

39:50.020 --> 39:52.011
No, no, no,
I'll do nothing of the sort.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.847
I'm gonna get a new sponsor.

39:53.890 --> 39:57.155
Ideally with your help.

39:57.190 --> 39:59.829
There's a meeting at St. Luke's
in half an hour.

39:59.860 --> 40:02.897
There's some regulars there
that might be worth meeting.

40:04.100 --> 40:06.022
(sighs heavily)

40:07.900 --> 40:10.960
Okay.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.558
Shall we?

40:12.610 --> 40:14.635
Oh, now that we're friends,

40:14.680 --> 40:16.500
is it okay if I ask out Joan?

40:16.540 --> 40:17.700
(sighs)

40:17.740 --> 40:19.742
You're joking.

40:19.780 --> 40:22.010
When I'm not being a sponsor,
I'm pretty funny.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.041
Guess you'll have
to get used to it.
