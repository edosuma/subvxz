he's in a simulation still.

Oh, a-and, by the way, l don't
have discolored butthole flaps.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.415
That was part of the simulation.

You know what, Rick?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.562
Those guys took you
for a ride, too.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.689
You should try having a little
respect for the dummies of the Universe,
