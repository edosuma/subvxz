you were doing up here.

you were drinking.

the bad kids?

10:32.547 --> 10:34.283
[Dick] Thank you.

10:34.349 --> 10:36.051
[Dick] You want
a hot chocolate or something?

10:36.118 --> 10:37.720
Just coffee. Black.

10:37.787 --> 10:42.190
-I bet they
have marshmallows.
-I'm not a kid, okay?

10:42.256 --> 10:47.057
-Okay. Same for the lady.
-Okay.

10:53.902 --> 10:58.902
My mom didn't like me
to drink coffee.

11:02.543 --> 11:04.511
[Dick chuckles]

11:04.578 --> 11:07.129
Sweet tooth, huh?

11:12.854 --> 11:15.722
Rachel,

11:15.789 --> 11:18.326
has anything like...

11:18.393 --> 11:21.830
Like what happened,
ever happened before?

11:21.895 --> 11:24.596
No. Not like that.

11:27.802 --> 11:29.604
I didn't mean
to kill that guy.

11:29.671 --> 11:33.571
How did you kill that guy?

11:43.985 --> 11:47.222
We're gonna go see
some old friends of mine.
They're safe.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.658
They'll give us a place
to lie low for a second,
get our heads together,

11:50.725 --> 11:54.062
figure out
what to do next.

11:54.129 --> 11:56.998
You're scared, I get it.

11:57.065 --> 12:00.600
But sometimes
there's no time to be scared.

12:00.668 --> 12:01.970
Hey.

12:02.037 --> 12:07.008
No one's gonna get you.
Okay? I promise.

12:07.075 --> 12:11.424
Where else am I
going anyway?

12:24.058 --> 12:25.995
[Charlie]
Total deracination.

12:26.062 --> 12:28.830
Essentially, all his organs
burst at once, leaving him
a skin bag of blood,

12:28.897 --> 12:30.498
which I obviously drained.

12:30.565 --> 12:32.100
Obviously. COD?

12:32.167 --> 12:33.668
Sonics might have been
able to do this,

12:33.735 --> 12:37.270
but then his eyeballs
and testicles would've burst.

12:37.337 --> 12:38.673
No, this,

12:38.740 --> 12:40.774
this is fucking Biblical.

12:40.841 --> 12:42.376
Anything more specific?

12:42.443 --> 12:43.644
What part of fucking Biblical
did you not understand?

12:43.711 --> 12:46.081
-Charlie.
-Okay, uh...

12:46.147 --> 12:49.482
There's this.

12:49.549 --> 12:52.953
[Amy] Looks like a raven.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.190
Forward everything to me,
would you, Charlie?

12:55.256 --> 12:57.926
Uh, and Rohrbach...

12:57.991 --> 12:59.927
Be careful.

12:59.994 --> 13:03.331
This one doesn't
feel right, you know?

13:03.398 --> 13:06.000
-Okay.

19:09.964 --> 19:12.333
[Dick]
According to those files,
the man who came after you

19:12.400 --> 19:15.304
may have been part of
some doomsday cult.

19:15.371 --> 19:19.540
They apparently believe
it's their destiny to prevent
the end of the world.

19:19.607 --> 19:24.445
Does that mean
anything to you?

19:24.511 --> 19:27.382
Well, back when I was a kid,

19:27.449 --> 19:31.318
you didn't get too angry,
or too scared.

19:31.385 --> 19:33.354
'Cause bad things happen.

19:33.421 --> 19:38.326
What kind of bad things?

19:38.393 --> 19:42.930
I guess I'm an orphan,
too, now.

19:42.997 --> 19:47.769
[chuckles]

19:47.836 --> 19:51.905
That billionaire,
Bruce Wayne,

19:51.972 --> 19:54.375
he raised you?

19:54.442 --> 19:57.077
Yeah.

19:57.144 --> 20:00.648
Must've been cool.

20:00.715 --> 20:03.566
It was complicated.

20:08.690 --> 20:11.393
Does it ever go away?

20:11.459 --> 20:12.626
What?

20:12.693 --> 20:15.730
The feeling
you got left behind.

20:15.796 --> 20:20.402
Yeah.

20:20.468 --> 20:23.917
Well, no, not entirely.

20:29.912 --> 20:34.682
You're gonna leave me,
too, aren't you?

20:34.749 --> 20:39.287
No.

20:39.354 --> 20:44.325
No, I'm not gonna do that.

20:44.392 --> 20:45.442
[sighs]

20:56.438 --> 20:59.473
[Rachel]
So, who are these guys?

20:59.540 --> 21:00.909
[Dick] Old friends.

21:00.976 --> 21:02.777
Truth is I haven't
seem them for a long time.

21:02.843 --> 21:05.946
[knocking]

21:06.012 --> 21:09.717
[soft music playing]

21:09.784 --> 21:12.787
Hey.

21:12.853 --> 21:14.489
Hi.

21:14.556 --> 21:17.023
[Rachel] Hi.

21:17.090 --> 21:19.326
I'm Rachel.

21:19.394 --> 21:20.144
Dawn.

21:28.102 --> 21:31.140
Can we talk?

21:31.205 --> 21:36.205
You're about four years
too late, but sure.

21:40.548 --> 21:45.498
[Rachel] Wow.
This place is huge.

21:48.288 --> 21:50.592
[Dawn] She killed someone?

21:50.659 --> 21:55.498
She's just a kid.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.799
Whoever they are,
they've got people
in the department.

21:58.866 --> 22:01.836
We needed somewhere safe
to regroup,

22:01.903 --> 22:04.172
think about
what I'm gonna do.

22:04.238 --> 22:07.843
What about Bruce?

22:07.909 --> 22:11.358
He's no good with kids.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.550
Cop, huh?

22:16.617 --> 22:21.617
That's one
I never would've figured.

22:24.258 --> 22:25.559
[Dick] How are you?

22:25.626 --> 22:27.595
[Dawn] We're great.

22:27.662 --> 22:29.096
Hank's feeling the life
a little.

22:29.163 --> 22:31.465
Age waits for no man
and all that.

22:31.532 --> 22:33.000
How bad?

22:33.067 --> 22:35.236
Two fractures,
three concussions
in the last year,

22:35.303 --> 22:36.671
and a herniated disk.

22:36.738 --> 22:38.105
Jesus, Dawn.

22:38.173 --> 22:42.644
We're still good
out there, Dick.
Really good.

22:42.711 --> 22:43.811
Not one slip-up.

22:43.878 --> 22:46.513
You should quit,
you both should.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.416
That's the plan.

22:48.483 --> 22:52.988
Soon as we take out
these gun suppliers
he's obsessed with.

22:53.055 --> 22:58.055
One more chance
to do some good
and he promised he's out.

22:59.426 --> 23:00.528
You could help us out.

23:00.595 --> 23:01.930
I'm out of the life, Dawn.

23:01.997 --> 23:06.997
Hey. The hell are you
doing here, Dick?

23:07.402 --> 23:08.469
Hank.

23:08.536 --> 23:09.837
I had a situation.

23:09.904 --> 23:11.707
Nice little reunion
you got going here.

23:11.773 --> 23:14.409
-[Dick] You know
it's not like that.
-Sure looks like it to me.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.276
[Dawn] Hank.

23:22.349 --> 23:23.785
What the fuck?

23:23.852 --> 23:28.852
[Dawn] Can we just
go back inside, please?

23:32.460 --> 23:35.460
[door opens, closes]

23:43.038 --> 23:46.775
I put Rachel
in the spare room
and Dick on the couch.

23:46.842 --> 23:49.544
It's goddamn summer camp.

23:49.611 --> 23:52.079
What's he doing here anyway?

23:52.146 --> 23:55.717
Hell of a coincidence,
him showing up here
night before a job.

23:55.784 --> 23:58.019
[Dawn] Coincidences happen.

23:58.086 --> 24:00.488
What, you think
I called him?

24:00.555 --> 24:04.726
Did you?

24:04.792 --> 24:06.694
I'm with you, Hank.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.565
Have been, will be.

24:09.632 --> 24:13.601
I'm gonna chalk it up
to stress that you
don't know that.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.003
[Dawn sighs]

24:16.070 --> 24:19.740
But now that he's here
we can use his help.

24:19.807 --> 24:22.477
We don't need him.
We've been fine.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.980
We have been.

24:25.047 --> 24:28.950
But fine might not be enough
to shut this gun op down.

24:29.017 --> 24:32.253
The three of us
are unstoppable.

24:32.320 --> 24:35.257
We could go out
on the win you want.

24:35.324 --> 24:39.160
And then you can heal,
get better.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.926
We can get better.

24:47.568 --> 24:50.704
He won't help us.

24:50.771 --> 24:54.875
He only watches out
for himself.

24:54.942 --> 24:58.843
People don't change, babe.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.616
We'll see.

25:02.683 --> 25:06.319
So, you and Dawn.

25:06.386 --> 25:07.821
No.

25:07.888 --> 25:12.159
You realize it's impossible
to lie to me, right?

25:12.226 --> 25:16.765
When we were kids.

25:16.830 --> 25:18.398
Good night.

25:18.465 --> 25:21.615
Why did you hurt her?

25:24.372 --> 25:25.807
I didn't mean to.

25:25.874 --> 25:28.675
That's not an excuse.

25:28.742 --> 25:31.479
Yeah, well,
it's all in the past.

25:31.546 --> 25:33.346
Not for her.

25:39.319 --> 25:41.420
Get some rest.

25:46.861 --> 25:51.265
[breathes deeply]

25:51.332 --> 25:54.481
[cellphone vibrating]

26:08.214 --> 26:12.921
Hey, it's me.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.087
I'll be there.

26:35.710 --> 26:38.380
[Dawn and Rachel chatting]

26:38.446 --> 26:39.980
[Dawn] Like the second
to last one.
[Rachel] Yeah.

26:40.048 --> 26:41.851
[Dawn] I've seen it.
You're gonna love it.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.051
[Rachel] Yeah?
[Dawn] Yeah. Why don't you
go watch it right now?

26:44.118 --> 26:46.887
-And take your shoes off.
-[Rachel] Okay. [chuckles]

26:46.954 --> 26:50.759
-Thanks, Khaleesi.
-[Dawn chuckles]

26:50.825 --> 26:52.961
[Dick] What'd you do
with Rachel?

26:53.028 --> 26:54.896
You know, the sullen one?

26:54.963 --> 26:58.933
I didn't do anything with her.
I just didn't treat her
like a kid.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.603
She's a good girl.

27:01.669 --> 27:04.838
Do you wanna take a look?

27:04.905 --> 27:07.409
At the case.

27:07.476 --> 27:09.810
[Dawn]<i>The supplier's name
</i> <i>is Bronson.</i>

27:09.877 --> 27:11.779
<i>He's moving
</i> <i>small hand guns.</i>

27:11.846 --> 27:14.848
[camera clicks]

27:14.915 --> 27:16.852
He's trying to corner
the pre-teen market.

27:16.919 --> 27:19.686
Intel says they're making
a new shipment tomorrow night
on the docks,

27:19.753 --> 27:21.489
and we think
we can break the chain.

27:21.556 --> 27:22.605
[sighs]

27:32.866 --> 27:34.669
The famous Bird Computer.

27:34.736 --> 27:38.574
-Wayne Enterprises tech?
-[chuckles]

27:38.641 --> 27:42.845
What happened
between you two,
you and Bruce?

27:42.912 --> 27:46.212
[Rachel] Dragons?
This show just got
so much better.

27:46.279 --> 27:49.049
[chuckles]

27:49.116 --> 27:50.884
It's a big responsibility.

27:50.951 --> 27:52.720
What?

27:52.787 --> 27:56.090
Taking her in.

27:56.157 --> 27:57.759
I mean, I know
how healing it must be,

27:57.826 --> 28:02.826
doing what Bruce did for you
when you lost your parents.

28:03.298 --> 28:05.166
But taking care of a kid
is complicated,

28:05.232 --> 28:07.769
you know that
better than anyone.

28:07.836 --> 28:12.273
I'm not taking her in.

28:12.340 --> 28:14.942
I'm not good at
the staying with people part.

28:15.009 --> 28:19.279
I don't have to tell you that.

28:19.346 --> 28:20.481
[sighs]

28:20.548 --> 28:22.884
Look, I know things
are tight around here,

28:22.951 --> 28:24.586
so I thought Alfred
could give me some money,

28:24.653 --> 28:27.888
maybe help out a bit,
help out Rachel
at the same time.

28:27.955 --> 28:29.723
Two birds with one stone.

28:29.790 --> 28:31.226
Well, three, I guess.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.194
Wait, you want to
leave her here?

28:33.260 --> 28:34.695
Just for a while,
just until...

28:34.761 --> 28:37.832
Until when?

28:37.898 --> 28:40.067
You don't understand, Dawn.

28:40.134 --> 28:43.872
I'm no good at family.
I can't...

28:43.938 --> 28:45.839
You don't know
what I've become.

28:45.906 --> 28:49.911
What are you talking about?

28:49.978 --> 28:52.377
[computer beeps]

28:55.849 --> 28:57.184
Dawn, do not hit
this delivery.

28:57.251 --> 28:58.720
Look at the number
of security contractors.

28:58.786 --> 29:00.355
Hey, don't change the subject.

29:00.422 --> 29:02.757
What do you mean
"what you've become"?

29:02.824 --> 29:06.693
[door opens, closes]

29:06.760 --> 29:10.196
Well, isn't this cozy?

29:10.263 --> 29:12.733
Hey.

29:12.799 --> 29:14.670
Just like the old days.

29:14.737 --> 29:16.503
We were just
talking things through, okay?

29:16.570 --> 29:18.373
Come and go,

29:18.440 --> 29:20.107
-take what you want.
-Hank.

29:20.174 --> 29:22.977
Don't touch me.

29:23.044 --> 29:24.979
-[Rachel] Stop.
-You want my girl now?

29:25.046 --> 29:27.048
[Rachel] Stop!

29:27.115 --> 29:29.365
[screams] Stop!

29:41.596 --> 29:43.096
I'm sorry.

29:48.001 --> 29:50.671
Jesus.

29:50.738 --> 29:52.538
[door opens]

30:02.017 --> 30:03.366
[exhales]

30:14.962 --> 30:17.063
[girl sobbing]

30:22.069 --> 30:24.170
What the fuck?

30:29.844 --> 30:33.914
Hey, you okay?

30:33.981 --> 30:38.086
What's your name?

30:38.153 --> 30:40.354
I don't have a name.
Where's your partner?

30:40.421 --> 30:42.624
[grunts]

30:42.691 --> 30:44.826
-Tell us.
-[boy] Where is Dick Grayson?

30:44.893 --> 30:49.830
[girl] Where's Dick Grayson?

30:49.897 --> 30:51.531
Tell us where he is.

30:51.598 --> 30:52.799
[boy] Where is he?

30:52.866 --> 30:54.669
[grunts]

30:54.736 --> 30:55.935
[groans]

31:03.611 --> 31:06.614
[door opens, closes]

31:06.681 --> 31:09.817
[dad] You sneaky kids.

31:09.884 --> 31:11.586
Didn't save any fun for us.

31:11.653 --> 31:16.603
We can still
have some fun, dear.

31:19.894 --> 31:22.529
Can't we?

31:22.596 --> 31:24.096
[knocking]

31:32.874 --> 31:36.310
[sighs]

31:36.377 --> 31:39.213
[Rachel] I'm sorry.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.750
It's getting worse.

31:41.817 --> 31:44.419
You don't have anything
to be sorry for, Rachel.

31:44.486 --> 31:49.486
-I'm the one who should...
-[knocking]

31:49.824 --> 31:53.796
How you doing, sweetheart?

31:53.862 --> 31:58.665
Hank is sorry.
He can be a real
asshole sometimes.

31:58.732 --> 32:01.336
We gotta go.

32:01.403 --> 32:04.138
Hank and I have that thing.

32:04.204 --> 32:06.273
Dawn, I really think
you should reconsider.

32:06.340 --> 32:09.210
Okay? We both know
it's too dangerous.

32:09.277 --> 32:13.477
You win some,
you lose some.

32:14.882 --> 32:17.618
Take care of him, okay?

32:17.685 --> 32:21.454
He needs all the help
he can get.

32:21.521 --> 32:22.271
Okay.

32:31.098 --> 32:35.970
[door closes]

32:36.037 --> 32:38.940
She needs your help.

32:39.007 --> 32:42.109
I can feel it.

32:42.176 --> 32:44.045
Isn't that what you do?

32:44.112 --> 32:45.946
What?

32:46.013 --> 32:48.849
You help people.

32:48.915 --> 32:50.684
[chuckles]

32:50.750 --> 32:53.601
I used to think so.

33:02.698 --> 33:07.698
I used to think
it was one of things
I was best at.

33:07.969 --> 33:09.604
Until I realized

33:09.671 --> 33:11.972
the more help some needed
the worse I had to
hurt the others.

33:12.039 --> 33:14.740
Do you understand?

33:19.814 --> 33:22.617
Sometimes,

33:22.683 --> 33:27.683
when I feel
the darkness come out...

33:28.155 --> 33:30.705
...it feels good.

33:33.428 --> 33:36.798
I understand.

33:36.864 --> 33:39.433
You want to help them.

33:39.500 --> 33:43.704
You're just scared.

33:43.771 --> 33:48.771
Sometimes there's just
no time to be scared.

33:53.080 --> 33:55.750
[indistinct chatter]

33:55.817 --> 33:57.085
[man] Oh, shit!

33:57.152 --> 34:01.155
-[guns firing]
-[men grunting]

34:01.221 --> 34:04.826
[man yelling]

34:04.893 --> 34:08.963
Dick was wrong.
Only a few of 'em.

34:09.030 --> 34:10.398
Oh, yeah.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.865
Wisconsin, here we come.

34:11.932 --> 34:13.534
-[gunshots]
-[grunts]

34:13.601 --> 34:14.351
Hank!

34:25.847 --> 34:26.597
Shit.

34:33.188 --> 34:35.588
Where were we?

34:35.655 --> 34:36.856
Oh, yes.

34:41.228 --> 34:46.228
I believe your pants
were coming down.

34:46.934 --> 34:49.471
This will be the worst

34:49.538 --> 34:54.074
and last pain
you ever experience.

34:54.141 --> 34:58.278
[muffled screaming]

34:58.346 --> 35:02.150
[screaming]

35:02.217 --> 35:06.119
[man] Go!

35:06.186 --> 35:07.237
[yells]

35:12.827 --> 35:14.626
No! [grunts]

35:22.469 --> 35:26.039
[man screaming]

35:26.106 --> 35:29.556
Let's go the other way.

35:33.981 --> 35:36.681
[groaning in pain]

35:41.322 --> 35:45.893
You're welcome.

35:45.960 --> 35:46.860
Jesus.

35:51.132 --> 35:54.731
-Come on.
-[Hank groans]

36:35.242 --> 36:38.092
[breathing heavily]

37:04.907 --> 37:08.376
You weren't kidding
about having changed.

37:08.443 --> 37:13.443
I've never seen you
like that before.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.757
Rachel.

37:22.822 --> 37:23.873
Rachel.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.438
[birds cooing]

37:37.505 --> 37:39.574
She's up here.

37:39.641 --> 37:43.077
Hey, what are you
doing up here?

37:43.143 --> 37:47.081
I was worried.

37:47.148 --> 37:51.085
Rach.

37:51.152 --> 37:53.101
What's wrong?

37:56.523 --> 38:01.028
You were gonna
leave me here.

38:01.096 --> 38:06.096
You said you weren't
but you lied.

38:07.034 --> 38:11.972
You must lie a lot.

38:12.039 --> 38:15.543
You're good at it.

38:15.610 --> 38:20.409
[Hank]
What's she talking about?

38:23.117 --> 38:24.452
[Dick]
Hank, don't read that. I--

38:24.518 --> 38:29.018
[Hank]
It's got my name on it.

38:33.226 --> 38:35.327
What the fuck?

38:42.103 --> 38:45.172
You were gonna
leave her here?

38:45.239 --> 38:47.675
You were gonna pay us?

38:47.742 --> 38:49.643
It's not that simple.

38:49.710 --> 38:52.813
"I know you guys
can watch out for her."

38:52.880 --> 38:55.315
Seems pretty simple to me.

38:55.382 --> 38:56.650
You were gonna buy us?

38:56.717 --> 39:00.288
Hank, slow down.
He's just trying to help.

39:00.355 --> 39:01.655
Wait, did you
know about this?

39:01.722 --> 39:03.257
-You saw what he did.
-That's enough.

39:03.324 --> 39:04.824
He's a fucking psychopath.

39:04.891 --> 39:06.827
[arguing]

39:06.894 --> 39:11.894
Hey, Rachel,
I was gonna
come back for you.

39:17.204 --> 39:20.775
Liar.

39:20.842 --> 39:25.112
You were never
coming back for me.

39:25.179 --> 39:27.481
[door opens]

39:27.548 --> 39:32.548
[mom] Well, hello there,
you four.

39:35.657 --> 39:37.492
Who the fuck
are these guys?

39:37.559 --> 39:38.925
[grunts]

39:38.992 --> 39:42.028
Rachel, come on.

39:42.096 --> 39:45.365
[Dawn grunts]

39:45.432 --> 39:49.336
Get down.

39:49.403 --> 39:50.605
Wait, don't leave.

39:50.672 --> 39:52.172
[grunting]

40:08.489 --> 40:09.840
[choking]

40:15.563 --> 40:19.032

40:19.099 --> 40:21.469
Hank!

40:21.536 --> 40:26.173
No!

40:26.239 --> 40:26.989

There you are, dear.

41:11.753 --> 41:13.119
Hank!

41:13.186 --> 41:14.987
[Hank] Dawn.

41:21.061 --> 41:21.811
Dawn!

41:34.409 --> 41:38.847
Dawn.

41:38.914 --> 41:41.182
[gasping for breath]

41:41.250 --> 41:44.786
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

41:44.853 --> 41:48.121
[gasps]
I'm dying.

41:48.188 --> 41:49.556
Dawn?

41:49.623 --> 41:52.293
[gasping]

41:52.360 --> 41:54.295
Dawn!
