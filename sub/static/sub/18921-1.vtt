<i> We've got reports</i>

<i> All units in the vicinity,</i>

01:42.136 --> 01:44.336
Whoo!

01:44.338 --> 01:47.306

<i> All units, possible man down.</i>

03:03.082 --> 03:04.283
Hands up!

03:04.285 --> 03:06.185
You know the drill.

03:07.353 --> 03:09.755
She is not giving up.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.293
You are not going
to do anything!

03:17.163 --> 03:21.366
You are going to turn
yourself in like the last one.

03:21.968 --> 03:23.735
Nice

03:23.737 --> 03:26.271
and slow.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.906
Go to hell.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.361
Polish your bike?

06:02.363 --> 06:03.495
What?

06:03.497 --> 06:04.996
Polish your bike?

06:06.466 --> 06:08.667
Yeah, sure, kid.
Knock yourself out.

06:14.341 --> 06:16.007
Hello?

06:18.411 --> 06:19.578
Hello?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.546
Ah, siouxsie with an "x."

06:21.548 --> 06:23.548
How is my little
Indian Princess?

06:25.084 --> 06:26.318
You mind?

06:26.320 --> 06:27.586
Hmm?

06:28.087 --> 06:31.556
Oh, got you.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.527
Now, what can I put
in your shopping basket today?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.095
What you should've
already done, Ben.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.031
Excuse me, in my domain,
you call me the naked wizard.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.067
What?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.368
Well, yeah,

06:43.370 --> 06:44.936
'cause nothing hides
from my wizardry.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.838
Just like
what's under your clothes.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.907
<i> I'd penetrate that.</i>

06:48.909 --> 06:51.009
Keep your dick
habits to yourself.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.012
Do you have it?

06:54.014 --> 06:57.149
One super-creepy-style virus
no computer can resist.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.818
Just slide it
into the lecture-room
computer.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.853
And I'm on the detention list.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.556
Taking care of business
as we speak.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.291
Are you serious?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.960
I did everything you suggested
and I'm still not on the list?

07:08.962 --> 07:10.929
It'll be done
as soon as you arrive.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.497
<i> Give it to me, baby.</i>

07:12.499 --> 07:15.801
Fine. I'll PayPal
you when I'm done.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.736
Hey, I just got to ask.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.305
If you really think
it's murder, why don't you
just go to the police?

07:20.307 --> 07:21.740
Because, naked wizard,

07:21.742 --> 07:24.209
when I have my proof,
they'll burn.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.211
<i> You know you want it.</i>

07:26.213 --> 07:28.079
Fuck, she's crazy.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.882
But I'd tap that.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.761
Thanks, kid.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.197
Where's the Benjamin?

07:46.699 --> 07:49.768
You're shitting me,
right? Beat it.

08:29.542 --> 08:31.610
All this money.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.645
God, I hate this school.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.840
Hmmm. Are you sure
you're in detention today?

09:01.842 --> 09:05.110
I'm having trouble
pulling up the list.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.612
You don't think
that I've earned
my place here?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.260
Miss hess!

09:22.262 --> 09:23.662
This is not a part

09:23.664 --> 09:25.730
of the crestview-approved
grieving process!

09:26.365 --> 09:27.732
Get off the car.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.368
No can do, Mr. Nash.

09:30.370 --> 09:34.239
My sister's corpse splashed
all over the hood of your car.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.707
And I'm sorry about that.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.143
The world needs to know!

09:38.145 --> 09:40.011
This isn't
gonna help anyone.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.613
Oh.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.481
Please, get off the car.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.691
I mean, first the hood,
now the roof.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.292
Yeah.
The side of the car.

09:54.294 --> 09:57.128
No, it's not appropriate.
It's not appropriate!

09:57.130 --> 09:58.997
I want you to come see me
after school for detention!

09:58.999 --> 10:00.732
Ooh, I'll come see you.
For detention!

10:00.734 --> 10:03.134
Because I've been bad.
I've been so bad. Oh!

10:03.136 --> 10:05.203
I've seen this all before.
Okay.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.871
It hurts me, to give it
to you but you're
gonna have detention.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.807
It hurts me,
but I like it.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.108
No, I don't do that.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.210
Yes, yes!
Don't do that. Let's go.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.046
You're a witness.
She's a witness as well.
Kids, get back to class.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.182
Yes, you've been so
bad and naughty.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.917
All of you go to class.
It's fine.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.352
We're gonna burn another car
tomorrow. Back to class.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.520
Everybody, detention,
'cause you've been bad,

10:22.522 --> 10:24.956
you've been bad,
you've been bad!

10:24.958 --> 10:26.658
In spite of your actions...

10:26.660 --> 10:28.793
Over 100,000 hits on YouTube.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.363
Right, but headmaster
Nash usually reserves

10:31.365 --> 10:34.299
his weekend punishments
for only certain students.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.803
Oh, you mean the rich kids?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.005
Oh, no, no, no, no.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.773
I do not like using
the r word.

10:41.775 --> 10:45.710
All right, well,
Dr. knight, Mr. na...

10:45.712 --> 10:49.214
Headmaster Nash told me
to come here today.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.682
I don't know. There must
be some kind of error

10:50.684 --> 10:52.050
in your dumbass computer.

10:52.052 --> 10:55.854
Siouxsie, Mr. Nash
is very clear on his rules,

10:55.856 --> 10:58.757
and he loves updating
his lists properly.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.693
But if you insist that
he put you on the list,
i can give him a call.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.461
No, no, it's okay.

11:03.463 --> 11:06.464
What kid willingly comes
to detention on
a Saturday, right?

11:06.466 --> 11:08.099
Yeah, well, it's protocol.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.301
If you're
not on the list,
you can't even be on campus

11:10.303 --> 11:11.603
on a Saturday.

11:11.605 --> 11:14.005
Especially after that horrible
event that happened.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.541
Just one second here.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.244
Oh.

11:27.586 --> 11:29.721
There you go. Hmmm.

11:30.556 --> 11:32.390
Just appeared.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.359
How wonderful.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.629
Let's get you fitted
right into your custom
detention, shall we?

11:37.631 --> 11:39.164
Yay.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.734
We must find Max.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.035
That weirdo?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.738
Oh, well,
he has the pass
code, siouxsie.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.173
And I think
you'd like him,

11:48.175 --> 11:50.341
giving you both have
the same Indian heritage.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.143
The only thing that guy
and I have in common

11:52.145 --> 11:54.412
is that we hate to clean up
after the white man.

11:55.514 --> 11:57.015
Oh, my.

12:04.690 --> 12:07.959
Siouxsie, did I ever say
i was sorry about your sister?

12:08.928 --> 12:10.095
No.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.331
No one has.

12:13.333 --> 12:17.335
She was a light at this school
and a wonderful journalist.

12:18.504 --> 12:19.938
Yeah.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.240
If only I had known
she were depressed.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.075
I have an assortment
of medications...

12:24.077 --> 12:25.810
She wasn't depressed.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.779
Oh, of course. Yeah.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.381
That was
less than appropriate.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.885
My apology is a ball of light
that I hand to you.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.823
Wow. Thanks.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.661
Oh, there he is.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.330
Max!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.172
Max.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.907
Dr. knight.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.076
- How are you today?
- Wonderful.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.111
How could I not be
on this glorious day?

13:00.113 --> 13:01.746
It's a good day to mop.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.882
Yes, of course.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.251
Max, can you open
the library for us?

13:06.253 --> 13:08.820
But the other
bad kids aren't...

13:08.822 --> 13:10.255
They're not here yet.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.824
Oh, there are no such things
as bad kids, Max.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.292
They're only misguided.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.337
<i> If your mother</i>
<i> were alive, she'd be...</i>

13:26.339 --> 13:28.573
Ashamed.
Say it Broadway, dad.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.708
Otherwise us gays
just ignore breeders.

13:30.710 --> 13:33.845
Being gay is the last
thing on my list
of problems with you.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.513
Oh, yay.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.282
Using and dealing drugs,

13:37.284 --> 13:39.784
getting caught having
sex in bathrooms,
that's at the top.

13:39.786 --> 13:44.255
Dad, everyone knows you have
to go where the dick is.

14:15.955 --> 14:18.122
<i> Mother,</i>
<i> why am I even here?</i>

14:18.124 --> 14:19.691
<i> You're a senator.</i>

14:19.693 --> 14:23.795
Yes, who happens to be
going after the presidency,

14:23.797 --> 14:26.464
so we need
to be squeaky clean.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.000
And after that party
you threw,

14:29.002 --> 14:31.936
detention is the least
you could do.

14:31.938 --> 14:35.106
I wasn't even there.
The least you could do.

14:36.642 --> 14:38.176
Yes, mother.

14:46.318 --> 14:49.420
<i> If you had</i>
<i> any real influence</i> ,
<i> I wouldn't need to be here.</i>

14:49.422 --> 14:51.322
Baby, you can't go pushing
silly white girls

14:51.324 --> 14:52.724
into swimming pools
for no reason.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.526
Jesus, daddy,
who's really white these days?

14:56.629 --> 14:58.263
Someone died, faith.

14:58.265 --> 15:01.065
And we do not take
the lord's name in vain.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.834
Look at it this way,

15:02.836 --> 15:06.838
after today,
we can put this goddamn
thing behind us.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.207
Christ, mom, adjust your meds.

15:18.050 --> 15:19.517
<i> Oh, Max,</i>

15:19.519 --> 15:21.119
children are a vocation,

15:21.121 --> 15:23.221
yet you act
like it's a miracle

15:23.223 --> 15:25.957
that they don't kill
each other.

15:56.221 --> 15:58.022
Phones, please.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.490
Thank you.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.794
No candy crushing
during detention hours.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.096
Ah, that ratchet bitch.
Cute.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.464
Good god.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.399
This thing just got
a lot more interesting.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.735
How wonderful,
you're all friends.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.137
Shall we?

16:13.139 --> 16:16.040
Phone, please.
Thank you. Thank you.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.682
Now, to prevent
any new incidents
from occurring,

16:24.684 --> 16:28.786
every special door has
a pass code instead of a lock.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.054
If the power goes out,

16:30.056 --> 16:32.190
the doors
will automatically unlock.

16:32.192 --> 16:36.227
So, this will be safe
yet fun for us all.

16:37.229 --> 16:38.529
Max?

16:41.934 --> 16:44.168
Max?

16:44.170 --> 16:45.903
Code's not working.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.705
Code's not working?

16:47.707 --> 16:48.940
Awesome. Detention cancelled.

16:48.942 --> 16:50.541
Sweet!

16:50.543 --> 16:53.111
No, no. Why don't you guys
take this restroom opportunity

16:53.113 --> 16:56.047
while we fix
this tiny little issue.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.516
It should only be a moment,
I'm sure. Right, Max?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.018
I don't know.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.153
I hear bad things.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.156
Right.

17:06.525 --> 17:08.626
Well, off you go.
Come on, come on.

17:22.342 --> 17:26.144
Ah, yeah,
kill the fucking pope!

17:26.146 --> 17:29.180
Yo, yo, yo, bw.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.115
Come on, come on, free sample.

17:31.117 --> 17:34.185
Your sister loved it!

17:43.829 --> 17:45.396
<i> Did I see on Twitter</i>

17:45.398 --> 17:47.131
<i> your father's been looking</i>
<i> at houses in Washington?</i>

17:47.133 --> 17:49.367
That's right, he'll
be a spiritual
advisor to the nation

17:49.369 --> 17:51.335
if senator wilkes
gets the nomination.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.704
When she gets the nomination.
And my mother...

17:53.706 --> 17:56.974
Will receive
what droppeth from heaven.

17:56.976 --> 17:59.177
Courtesy of Attila the hun.

18:00.045 --> 18:01.446
You know nothing.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.714
Sure about that,
ho chi minnie mouse?

18:04.316 --> 18:05.650
Bitch.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.321
Well, I'll give you
girls a moment alone.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.828
What does she know?

18:16.830 --> 18:19.230
All I know
is her shit stinks.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.499
Undercrust.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.742
My sister and those kids...

18:31.744 --> 18:33.411
You would think
that single day

18:33.413 --> 18:35.079
should've filled the school's

18:35.081 --> 18:37.882
"that's trucking horrible"
quota for...

18:37.884 --> 18:39.817
Well, forever, but...

18:39.819 --> 18:43.421
Then, last week,
with your sister...

18:44.790 --> 18:47.091
Were you friends with her?

18:47.093 --> 18:48.759
Not to
hang out with her.

18:50.762 --> 18:53.564
I'm glad I wasn't there
when it happened.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.434
Were you even at your party?
I didn't see you there.

18:56.436 --> 18:58.169
Got to stay squeaky clean
for mom's latest campaign.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.871
Mmm. Good idea.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.672
We were talking about Alyson.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.707
Oh, god.

19:02.709 --> 19:04.242
Shouldn't have gotten
so drunk.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.910
Or gotten so off the roof.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.178
Fuck you.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.480
Hey, I'm not the one
she pushed into a pool.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.116
You saw that?

19:12.118 --> 19:15.353
Um, the entire senior
class saw that.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.823
Oh, uh, time for another...

19:18.825 --> 19:20.191
Hey, come on!

19:20.193 --> 19:22.026
Tell me what happened,
or you won't get this back.

19:22.028 --> 19:23.394
Really?

19:23.396 --> 19:26.364
Fine. Story time it is.

19:33.805 --> 19:35.473
Whoo!

19:36.041 --> 19:38.209
Seniors 2015!

19:39.412 --> 19:41.379
Lean and mean, bitches!

19:43.849 --> 19:46.484
Pfft! Piss!

19:46.486 --> 19:48.352
They're serving piss!

19:48.354 --> 19:50.521
Come on,
where's the good stuff?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.757
- Come on!
- Mr. Marquez!

19:52.759 --> 19:55.560
Unacceptable,
Mr. Marquez. Get down.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.862
Come on, Mr. Nash.
Right now!

20:02.067 --> 20:04.635
Despite the fact that
the wilkes are kind enough

20:04.637 --> 20:06.204
to let us use
their personal venue,

20:06.206 --> 20:08.206
this is still
an official school event.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.474
I'm gonna get
you for this, Nash.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.476
Suck it up, Ethel.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.579
She's been bad.
She's being punished.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.247
Let me give you
a little lesson.

20:16.249 --> 20:20.151
Once you got 'em by the balls,
hearts and minds will follow.

20:20.153 --> 20:22.920
I'm already ahead
of you, Mr. Nash.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.589
Right here.

20:42.774 --> 20:45.476
Hey, watch out
for the retarded boy!

20:45.478 --> 20:47.912
I got you covered,
sweet cheeks.

20:54.786 --> 20:56.420
There you go.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.891
Are you new to crestview?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.493
Sorta.

21:03.061 --> 21:04.762
Have fun, guys.

21:06.098 --> 21:09.000
Here ya go, yamoho.
Wink-wink.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.701
Oh, right.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.575
You take the red cup

21:17.577 --> 21:20.678
and I'll show you
how deep the rabbit hole goes.

21:23.048 --> 21:24.882
Moron.
Bitch, please.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.917
That's suicide, Alyson!

21:26.919 --> 21:28.119
What are you thinking?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.921
Siouxsie, you need to stop
getting in my way.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.156
I'm just trying to help.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.791
Help yourself to a drink.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.893
Oh!

21:37.362 --> 21:39.697
You fucking bitch!

21:42.534 --> 21:45.870
So, Brian, I heard you have
a really awesome friend.

21:45.872 --> 21:49.507
Yeah, yeah.
You know how he hangs.

21:50.108 --> 21:51.242
Yeah, he's a baller.

21:51.244 --> 21:52.643
I'm gonna kill her!

21:52.645 --> 21:54.011
Bitch!

21:55.714 --> 21:57.281
Oh, Brian,

21:57.283 --> 21:59.417
we have to get you
out of that shirt.

22:11.297 --> 22:13.597
Oh, come on.

22:13.599 --> 22:16.233
Mr. Alan, it's time
to break stereotypes,

22:16.235 --> 22:17.835
not reinforce them.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.238
No, no, no! Ah!

22:21.240 --> 22:22.440
Come on,
get back to the party.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.375
It's time to macarena.
Let's go.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.377
Don't tweet that.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.546
Oh!

22:28.548 --> 22:31.248
Well, now there's something
you don't see every day.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.950
Ladies, get dressed.

22:32.952 --> 22:34.852
Oh, good lord.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.854
Ugh.

22:38.256 --> 22:39.890
They're not with us.

22:40.959 --> 22:42.293
Why not?

22:42.295 --> 22:44.695
Get up. Get up.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.366
Young man, take his cock
out of your mouth!

22:48.368 --> 22:50.735
Put your clothes on. Let's go!

22:50.737 --> 22:53.838
Mr. Marquez,
i will see you in detention.

22:55.641 --> 22:59.143
Oh, my god, she jumped!
Oh, she fucking jumped!

23:08.186 --> 23:10.054
My car!

23:11.823 --> 23:14.158
<i> Shame no one saw her leap.</i>

23:14.160 --> 23:16.594
But everyone saw her crash.

23:16.596 --> 23:19.964
Totally flogged my night.
Well, um, for an hour.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.933
Then I found
an even hotter piece of ass.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.802
You get more ass
than a toilet seat?

23:24.804 --> 23:28.572
White boys like them
some Latin spice.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.108
Speaking of, my vial.
Story time's over.

23:32.043 --> 23:33.577
Drugs kill.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.251
What were you two
even fighting about anyway?

23:40.253 --> 23:42.453
Just a little bit of
"none of your
fucking business."

23:42.455 --> 23:44.088
Rawr. Apache has an axe.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.590
We're not the ones that said
she wanted to kill her.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.792
I never said that.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.226
My memory's
absolutely flawless.

23:49.228 --> 23:50.461
Wow. That's bullshit.

23:50.463 --> 23:51.595
Fuck you too, faith.

23:51.597 --> 23:54.064
You were so angry at her.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.700
Why do you say that?
Girl, what you think?

23:58.103 --> 24:00.204
Do you guys seriously think
i had something to do

24:00.206 --> 24:01.338
with my own sister's death?

24:01.340 --> 24:02.706
Hello, Facebook.

24:02.708 --> 24:05.109
Twitter.
Everybody thinks so.

24:05.111 --> 24:06.877
350 likes can't be wrong.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.147
Wow.

24:13.685 --> 24:15.853
You guys have no idea.

24:18.023 --> 24:20.024
Dr. knight
wants everyone back.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.245
You like lectures?

24:41.913 --> 24:43.214
No.

24:43.216 --> 24:44.448
Light reprimands?

24:44.450 --> 24:46.050
No.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.418
Occasional spankings?

24:47.420 --> 24:49.753
Fuck off.

24:49.755 --> 24:54.725
Look, I know we don't move
in the same social circles...

24:54.727 --> 24:56.093
You're rich, I'm poor.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.095
You live in a mansion.
I live in a trailer.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.931
Your family eats Sushi
and my family eats burgers.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.934
Burgers 24/7. Yeah, you win.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.170
Whatever, I'm sorry.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.906
Can we please just stop
pretending to be friends?

25:09.307 --> 25:10.641
Okay?

25:11.877 --> 25:14.345
Look, I get the whole
defensive thing.

25:14.347 --> 25:15.746
I get it.
Your sister's dead,

25:15.748 --> 25:17.248
you're a bitch, but...
You're an asshole.

25:17.250 --> 25:20.417
You are never gonna be
popular with that attitude.

25:20.419 --> 25:21.585
Any doll can be popular

25:21.587 --> 25:22.987
as long as you buy
her friends.

25:25.423 --> 25:27.992
Ouch.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.861
You and my mother
would get along really well.

25:40.171 --> 25:42.406
I, I don't understand.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.575
It, it's the right code.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.243
Well, if we can't get
into the library,

25:46.245 --> 25:48.279
what are we going to do, Max?

25:48.281 --> 25:50.581
I have all the codes
in my office at the stadium.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.715
I'll go check.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.183
Okay, well, hurry.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.952
Headmaster Nash hates
when we get off schedule.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.787
I'll be back!
All right.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.155
Where is he going?

25:58.157 --> 25:59.990
That's none of your concern,
faith Jackson.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.793
Guys, we're all just going
to stand here and wait.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.162
Now, would anyone care
to share their thoughts

26:05.164 --> 26:07.064
on what kind of butterfly
they'd like to be?

26:07.066 --> 26:08.198
No.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.800
This is stupid, with wings.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.602
Are you serious?
An <i> apatura Iris.</i>

26:11.604 --> 26:13.737
Dr. knight, can I talk
to you for a second?

26:13.739 --> 26:16.040
It's kind of personal.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.241
Okay.

26:19.177 --> 26:20.978
Alone.

26:20.980 --> 26:23.747
Well, I loathe
to leave a student in need.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.654
See, um...

26:32.490 --> 26:33.624
It's about my period.

26:33.626 --> 26:36.093
Oh, are you a late bloomer?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.194
No.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.929
I've, um...

26:38.931 --> 26:40.598
I've actually
been missing it.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.035
I think I might have
a bun in the oven.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.340
Oh!

26:49.342 --> 26:52.776
Do you think that maybe
we could talk more privately?

26:54.479 --> 26:57.047
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.823
There you go.
Thanks.

27:08.327 --> 27:09.393
What the hell?

27:09.395 --> 27:11.295
Ah, yes.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.531
After the incident,
some of the parents argued

27:14.533 --> 27:16.700
the statue was inappropriate,

27:16.702 --> 27:18.435
but some insist
that it's a reminder

27:18.437 --> 27:20.104
of our rainwater heritage.

27:22.407 --> 27:26.076
So while they argue,
Max is keeping it in here.

27:26.078 --> 27:28.912
Kind of makes things cramped,
don't you think?

27:38.423 --> 27:40.157
Sorry, Dr. knight.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.726
All right, Nash, payback time.

30:37.769 --> 30:39.303
Come on.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.205
<i> Excuse me</i>
<i> while I whip this out.</i>

30:42.740 --> 30:43.941
Come on.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.275
<i> Really?</i>

30:45.277 --> 30:47.177
<i> You know you want it.</i>

31:04.195 --> 31:05.896
I don't know what to
do with my thumbs.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.030
I know, right?

31:07.032 --> 31:09.099
I'm so bored.

31:09.101 --> 31:11.401
I think I might
die of boredom.

31:12.904 --> 31:14.638
It's not working.

31:14.640 --> 31:16.440
There's a surprise.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.309
Where'd you go?

31:19.311 --> 31:22.446
Um, Dr. knight had to leave.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.513
Did she say why?

31:24.983 --> 31:26.950
She had an emergency at home.

31:26.952 --> 31:29.019
Forgot to feed her cat

31:29.021 --> 31:30.921
or pet her kitty.
Wink-wink.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.022
I love kitties.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.358
You would.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.059
Maybe she saw a ghost
and spooked out.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.895
Spook this, <i> senorita.</i>

31:37.897 --> 31:40.330
It's not funny.
It's too scary.

31:41.065 --> 31:43.267
Especially vengeful ones.

31:46.471 --> 31:49.339
I don't know what to
do if I can't get you
into the library.

31:50.808 --> 31:52.910
Why not take us
to another room?

31:54.345 --> 31:56.179
What room?

31:56.181 --> 31:58.749
I mean, do we really have
to sit quietly in the library?

31:58.751 --> 32:01.251
Who says?

32:01.253 --> 32:04.421
The lecture hall's cool.
There's that big-ass screen.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.924
We can watch a movie.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.896
Stay here.

32:12.898 --> 32:14.698
I have to get into
the library.

32:18.704 --> 32:21.004
Okay. Show time.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.105
At least
now we can study.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.240
Girl, please.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.242
Ooh, what would Jesus study?

32:25.244 --> 32:28.645
Confucius say, "man who
lay girl on field
get peace on earth."

32:28.647 --> 32:29.947
Does confucius say anything

32:29.949 --> 32:32.215
about girls
who can play field hockey?

32:34.919 --> 32:39.656
Hey, uh, don't you think
it's time to take another hit?

32:39.658 --> 32:43.193
I can tell
we're gonna be good friends!

32:50.335 --> 32:51.835
Sure you wanna take
another hit of that?

32:51.837 --> 32:54.871
Better than talking
to you straight people.

32:54.873 --> 32:56.707
Hey, Sara,
that thing get porn?

32:56.709 --> 32:59.343
Find something
i can salute my flag to.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.610
Wink-wink.

33:01.646 --> 33:05.282
Googling porn,
soldiers, flag.

33:07.785 --> 33:09.486
Something's wrong here.

33:11.589 --> 33:12.923
It's acting sluggish.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.494
<i> Your mother</i>
<i> sucks cocks in hell.</i>

33:17.496 --> 33:20.430
Stupid school! There's
a virus on the network.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.299
- Googling kitty porn.
- Holy shit, man!

33:22.301 --> 33:24.468
Dude, props to whoever
set that up!

33:24.470 --> 33:26.703
<i> Your mother</i>
<i> sucks cocks in hell.</i>

33:26.705 --> 33:28.505
Oh, shit.

33:28.507 --> 33:32.442
Oh, thank goodness.
Oh, no, the Internet's down.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.545
Oh, my god!

33:35.547 --> 33:39.116
Oh, oh, oh, dude,
we're surrounded by pussies!

33:39.118 --> 33:41.218
Hey, don't hate
on the pussy, man.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.154
I'm just saying it's...
It's just not my thing.

33:49.894 --> 33:53.663
Not that there's anything
wrong with it, but...

33:53.665 --> 33:57.601
But I...

34:01.005 --> 34:04.441
Oh, shit. Oh!

35:17.415 --> 35:18.849
Crap, he overdosed!

35:18.851 --> 35:20.484
He does drugs all the time.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.152
Hey, Chinese fortune cookie,
stop telling us shit we know!

35:22.154 --> 35:23.720
I'm Japanese.
We need to help him!

35:23.722 --> 35:25.322
I know cpr.
I saw how to do it online.

35:25.324 --> 35:26.423
Bitch, you know
where those lips have been?

35:26.425 --> 35:28.091
You've seen that shit online?

35:28.093 --> 35:31.094
Oh, fuck me stupid, he's dead!

35:31.096 --> 35:33.130
We have to get out of here.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.253
What the hell is this?

35:56.255 --> 35:57.821
I don't know!

36:00.458 --> 36:03.793
We got to get outside
and call someone.

36:03.795 --> 36:07.330
Metal sliders, iron bars.

36:07.332 --> 36:09.499
It's a mouse trap.
It's a mouse trap.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.067
They're trapping us in here!

36:11.069 --> 36:13.336
No, no flipping way.

36:21.546 --> 36:25.849
Oh, my god, what's
that smell? Damn, Brian.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.417
Ugh.

36:28.586 --> 36:30.687
Mother trucker, Dr. knight!

36:30.689 --> 36:33.490
You said we'd be able to leave
if there was trouble.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.526
She said she just left?

36:36.528 --> 36:37.494
Yeah.

36:37.496 --> 36:38.795
Where are the codes?

36:38.797 --> 36:40.497
Why do they even have
this system?

36:40.499 --> 36:43.500
For, like,
tornados or something?

36:43.502 --> 36:45.635
Oh, my god,
you are such a cheerleader.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.537
Fuck you.
Jesus loves cheerleaders.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.773
How are we gonna
get out of here? How are we
gonna get out of here?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.608
I have homework to do!
We need the codes!

36:51.610 --> 36:53.777
Calm down. Need to breathe?
Do you need...

36:53.779 --> 36:56.680
Wait.
Let's just do the obvious.

37:06.557 --> 37:07.991
This school really is cursed.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.526
There's no air in here.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.661
I need to study.
There's a test on Monday.

37:11.663 --> 37:13.830
We can't get outside,
but break into the classrooms.

37:13.832 --> 37:17.534
How?
Those doors are made of wood.

37:17.536 --> 37:19.102
You're gonna set them on fire?

37:19.104 --> 37:20.403
No air, no fire, no codes!

37:20.405 --> 37:23.540
No. Jeez, no.
I'm gonna bash them in.

37:24.141 --> 37:25.275
Oh, okay.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.810
Max.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.612
He's still got to be
by the library.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.714
We got to go find Max. Max.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.850
Screw that. The science room.

37:33.852 --> 37:37.287
Probably has acid and stuff
that can devolve metal.

37:38.923 --> 37:40.523
Give me that.

37:49.033 --> 37:51.234
Um, maybe someone should
probably go check on Sara

37:51.236 --> 37:53.436
before she hurts herself
or kills herself or something.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.704
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, I'll do that.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.673
You can stay here
with the body.

37:57.108 --> 37:58.441
What?

37:58.443 --> 37:59.843
You know, just

37:59.845 --> 38:02.045
in case someone calls
because of the alarms.

38:02.047 --> 38:05.615
You know,
it's probably just glitching
because of the curse, right?

38:05.617 --> 38:10.320
That's why Brian died too,
right? 'Cause of the curse?

38:13.024 --> 38:14.491
Or he was murdered.

38:17.728 --> 38:19.329
Okay, yeah,
just go check on her.
I'll stay here.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.930
Okay, cool. Yeah.
Okay. Bye.

39:07.578 --> 39:10.113
Dr. knight?

39:12.484 --> 39:15.218
Yeah. Yes, hello?

39:15.220 --> 39:16.519
Dr. knight.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.089
Oh, siouxsie.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.490
Sweetkins.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.625
Will you let me out
of this closet, please?

39:23.260 --> 39:24.794
I can't do that yet.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.329
Siouxsie,
you are already in trouble.

39:26.331 --> 39:27.931
Do not make it double.

39:27.933 --> 39:31.134
Look, I'm really sorry
about the duct tape and stuff.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.436
Yeah, could you
just explain why?

39:33.438 --> 39:34.971
No.

39:36.907 --> 39:39.042
But I'm really glad to hear
that you're breathing.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.844
Siouxsie,
listen to me, please.

39:40.846 --> 39:42.912
Just let me out
and we can talk
about it, okay?

39:42.914 --> 39:45.682
I understand
the desire to act out.

39:45.684 --> 39:49.052
Hey, look, it's not like
anyone died, right?

39:49.720 --> 39:51.388
Right?

39:51.989 --> 39:53.723
Siouxsie!

39:53.725 --> 39:55.558
Nutmeg?

39:55.560 --> 39:58.528
My sweet little misguided
piece of shit!

40:06.070 --> 40:07.537
Oh.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.873
I need an extraction now.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.976
I don't care how you do it,
it needs to get done.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.445
I want out of this curse
and fucking school,

40:15.447 --> 40:16.980
you fucking bitch!

40:21.453 --> 40:23.753
There you are.
Hey, I'm two for two, huh?

40:23.755 --> 40:26.122
The virus and now
shutting down
all the dividers.

40:26.124 --> 40:29.526
Smegging sucks that
i have to hang out in
the shadows, though.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.995
I should've just got detention
so I could hang with you guys.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.664
Which reminds me,
about the detention list.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.466
What the fuck? Ah! Ah!

40:49.247 --> 40:50.880
Praise the lord, that worked.

41:03.627 --> 41:05.562
Of fucking course.

41:21.345 --> 41:23.546
Oh, Christ, you scared me.

41:23.548 --> 41:25.014
You find anything?

41:25.016 --> 41:26.850
Biblical proportions
of fuck-all.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.151
What have you been doing?

41:28.153 --> 41:30.053
I was looking for Sara.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.488
She's still breathing?

41:31.490 --> 41:33.890
I don't know.
Couldn't find her.

41:36.026 --> 41:37.694
But I found this.

41:37.696 --> 41:40.096
Ugh. Oh, my god.

41:42.166 --> 41:44.000
What is wrong with you?

41:45.803 --> 41:49.072
My sister used to do
a lot of this junk.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.140
Always thought
it was gonna kill her.

41:52.476 --> 41:54.210
Not some maniac
with a nail gun.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.915
Do you know how to test
for poisons?

41:59.817 --> 42:01.584
No.

42:02.386 --> 42:04.220
Fun fact number one,

42:04.222 --> 42:07.357
in the 8th century,
an arab chemist

42:07.359 --> 42:11.561
turned arsenic powder
into an odorless
and tasteless form,

42:11.563 --> 42:15.532
making it the perfect murder
weapon for unwanted relatives.

42:32.917 --> 42:34.083
Ah...

42:35.085 --> 42:36.152
What?

42:38.055 --> 42:39.689
Does that prove it?

42:39.691 --> 42:42.058
He was poisoned?

42:42.060 --> 42:43.259
I dunno.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.796
Oh, I don't...

42:46.798 --> 42:48.731
Uh, I failed chemistry.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.802
You're a wasp
without a stinger.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.004
All annoyance, no threat.

42:55.006 --> 42:57.607
Oh, really? Well then,
how about you do a bump then?

42:57.609 --> 42:59.876
Do a bump,
we'll know for sure.

43:01.378 --> 43:02.712
Fun fact number two...

43:02.714 --> 43:04.280
Poison's the weapon
of choice for women.

43:05.749 --> 43:06.916
There's no brute
force necessary.

43:06.918 --> 43:09.752
What does that mean?
I mean...

43:09.754 --> 43:11.154
Maybe you should
watch the girls more closely.

43:11.156 --> 43:13.957
Okay, screw you.
I'm already freaking out.

43:14.658 --> 43:16.626
I know.

43:16.628 --> 43:18.161
That's what I was thinking...

43:19.430 --> 43:20.763
What?

43:23.267 --> 43:25.868
Sex...You and me.

43:26.971 --> 43:28.905
It's just a way to relax.

43:28.907 --> 43:30.506
Are you shitting me?

43:30.508 --> 43:32.809
This was all some weird
way to hit on me?

43:35.112 --> 43:37.447
Maybe.

43:37.449 --> 43:40.249
I'm not gonna fuck you
just because I'm stressed.

43:40.251 --> 43:43.052
Okay, fine whatever.
No worries.

43:45.322 --> 43:47.023
I'm really good, though.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.664
Fine. Whatever.

43:54.666 --> 43:57.000
Fuck this spooky shit.
Let's do this.

44:06.510 --> 44:07.944
What are you doing?

44:10.080 --> 44:11.147
Sara.

44:14.852 --> 44:16.285
Are you all right?

44:17.254 --> 44:18.955
I saw...

44:19.923 --> 44:22.458
No, nothing. I'm stressed.

44:22.460 --> 44:25.194
I need to find a solution
and stop being stressed.

44:27.431 --> 44:29.065
Have you done that?

44:29.067 --> 44:31.234
I thought maybe I could find
a way to access the Internet.

44:31.236 --> 44:33.403
You know, like record
a YouTube video for help?

44:33.405 --> 44:34.904
I love YouTube.

44:34.906 --> 44:36.673
Have you seen the one
where the cat saves the boy?

44:36.675 --> 44:38.307
Yeah!
Yeah.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.148
But this virus,
it's so unusual.

44:45.150 --> 44:47.450
Like the way the files
are downloading
from the cloud.

44:47.452 --> 44:49.986
It's dismantling
their password protection.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.921
Like how?

44:51.923 --> 44:54.457
Like every single student's
personal blog, for one.

44:54.459 --> 44:56.259
Oh, look. One of mine.

44:57.761 --> 44:59.395
<i> Hello, interweb.</i>
<i> It's me again.</i>

44:59.397 --> 45:01.564
<i> I'd like to introduce you</i>
<i> to my new friend tebby.</i>

45:01.566 --> 45:03.700
<i> Tebby and I are in the nhs,</i>
<i> the math club,</i>

45:03.702 --> 45:05.935
<i> and we're also</i>
<i> field-hockey teammates</i>.

45:05.937 --> 45:08.371
<i> I should also tell you</i>
<i> tebby is a founding member</i>

45:08.373 --> 45:10.473
<i> of crestview's lgbt club.</i>

45:10.475 --> 45:14.143
<i> I'm not exactly sure</i>
<i> what lg...Whatever stands for,</i>

45:14.145 --> 45:16.879
<i> but it's very popular</i>
<i> and she's asked me to join.</i>

45:25.489 --> 45:27.156
So you're, like...

45:28.225 --> 45:29.492
You like...

45:30.060 --> 45:31.260
What?

45:35.232 --> 45:36.432
Never mind.

45:41.638 --> 45:44.173
Hey, can you click
on this one?

45:44.175 --> 45:46.375
The virus hasn't gotten
that file yet.

45:46.377 --> 45:48.377
Oh, shit.

45:48.379 --> 45:50.246
Why? Is it important?

45:50.248 --> 45:51.347
Yeah.

45:52.182 --> 45:53.316
What is it?

45:54.351 --> 45:55.918
It's my sister Alyson.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.187
She would upload
articles and videos.

45:59.356 --> 46:01.124
What articles?

46:01.126 --> 46:03.593
Legislators doing bad shit,

46:03.595 --> 46:07.463
people using politics
to screw other people over.

46:07.465 --> 46:10.566
Siouxsie, I'm sorry,
but your sister had too
much to drink that night.

46:10.568 --> 46:12.535
What happened to her
is completely logical.

46:12.537 --> 46:13.970
Logical?

46:13.972 --> 46:15.772
Then how the hell
do you explain your actions?

46:15.774 --> 46:17.173
I...

46:20.110 --> 46:22.044
I did what your
sister wanted.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.147
What?

46:24.149 --> 46:27.083
Seniors 2015!

46:27.085 --> 46:30.319
Lean and mean, bitches!

46:56.213 --> 46:58.347
I like your tassels.
They're hot.

47:11.595 --> 47:12.995
Are you new to crestview?

47:13.564 --> 47:15.998
Sorta.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.467
Is this one
of Nash's punishments?

47:18.469 --> 47:19.735
No, I'm an undercover cop.

47:19.737 --> 47:22.605
This is just how I spy
on people's conversations.

47:22.607 --> 47:25.174
Like jump street?
Yeah.

47:28.412 --> 47:31.514
No, it's a joke.
Of course it's Nash.

47:32.749 --> 47:34.417
I'll get him back later.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.552
Have fun, guys.

47:38.288 --> 47:41.490
Here you go, yamoho.
Wink wink.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.827
What's that?
Latin spice.

47:44.829 --> 47:46.495
Oh, right.

47:56.039 --> 47:57.607
You take the red cup

47:57.609 --> 48:00.977
and I'll show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

48:04.448 --> 48:08.918
Ethel, your friends
just flashed me one of these.

48:10.120 --> 48:11.454
Gross.

48:14.591 --> 48:16.626
Yeah, they were saying,
"hey, Mr. Nash..."

48:16.628 --> 48:18.828
Put that away.
What?

48:18.830 --> 48:20.329
Put it away.

48:25.837 --> 48:27.937
You fucking bitch,
I'll kill you!

48:27.939 --> 48:30.139
Not if I kill myself first!

48:32.042 --> 48:33.442
Miss hess!

48:33.444 --> 48:35.878
Who said that you could go
in this pool?

48:39.683 --> 48:41.918
Oh, shit. Cover for me.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.953
Yeah, go, I got it.

48:51.028 --> 48:52.395
Enjoying yourself?

48:52.397 --> 48:55.965
Are we on?
I can party.

48:55.967 --> 48:57.633
You wanna prove that?

48:58.635 --> 49:01.103
Hi. Enjoy the view.

49:03.907 --> 49:07.643
It's...Crazy.

49:07.645 --> 49:10.112
Hotheaded bitch
needed to cool off.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.281
- Cool off, bitch!
- No, don't!

49:12.283 --> 49:14.650
What, are you
all on the dope?

49:14.652 --> 49:16.619
Ah!

49:20.158 --> 49:22.058
Miss Jackson,
see you in detention.

49:22.060 --> 49:23.826
What?
Detention!

49:23.828 --> 49:26.429
First time for everything.
Ugh!

49:29.666 --> 49:33.135
Everybody, let me show
you how the geisha
will impress ya.

49:50.821 --> 49:54.790
Come on now, let's go.
Not another pool incident!

49:54.792 --> 49:56.592
Excuse me! Excuse me!

49:57.294 --> 49:58.761
Come on now, we're not...

50:16.313 --> 50:18.047
Hey.
You look pissed.

50:18.049 --> 50:19.448
Come on.

50:34.097 --> 50:36.732
All right, all right, come on.
We don't want anyone
to get hurt now.

50:36.734 --> 50:39.301
We don't want anyone else
to get hurt around here.

50:49.613 --> 50:53.616
How you doing? You ready?
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready!

51:07.097 --> 51:09.865
Hoo. Okay...

51:09.867 --> 51:12.535
Detention.

51:13.503 --> 51:15.271
What is wrong with you people?

51:15.273 --> 51:17.606
<i> But immediately</i>
<i> after...</i>

51:26.883 --> 51:28.517
<i> My car!</i>

51:30.420 --> 51:32.521
Your sister did anything
to get to the top.

51:32.523 --> 51:34.723
She chose that moment to jump.

51:34.725 --> 51:36.192
She didn't belong.

51:36.194 --> 51:37.860
Under crust.

51:37.862 --> 51:39.095
Bullshit.

51:39.097 --> 51:41.797
These are the facts
as I see them.

51:41.799 --> 51:44.166
But you know what?
Situation's changed.

51:44.168 --> 51:45.868
We need to get out of here.

51:45.870 --> 51:47.603
We're trapped.

51:47.605 --> 51:49.238
It's a mouse trap.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.273
We're mice.

51:52.175 --> 51:54.110
You're a mouse...

51:54.678 --> 51:56.245
And I'm a mouse.

52:00.250 --> 52:01.817
This a bad time?

52:01.819 --> 52:03.452
Yes. No. No!

52:04.020 --> 52:05.421
What's up?

52:05.423 --> 52:07.423
We broke into a room
that should help us.

52:08.492 --> 52:09.725
Cool. Okay.

52:17.701 --> 52:21.237
Why didn't
i think of this?

52:21.239 --> 52:23.839
Good one, Richie.
It's pretty sweet, right?

52:23.841 --> 52:25.975
So this is
the industrial arts room.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.276
What is this stuff?

52:27.278 --> 52:28.844
This is a Porsche.

52:29.913 --> 52:31.447
It's a drill press,

52:31.449 --> 52:33.315
a table saw, a Jigsaw...

52:33.317 --> 52:35.351
This is a jacksaw!
Neato.

52:35.353 --> 52:37.920
No, that's not, no.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.855
That's a...Wrench.

52:40.857 --> 52:42.758
Oh.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.327
Well, then why do we even
have this stuff?

52:45.329 --> 52:48.130
Don't we already pay people
to do it for us?

52:48.132 --> 52:49.765
You're messing
with me, right?

52:51.234 --> 52:53.068
All these tools
are so somebody can learn

52:53.070 --> 52:55.971
how to fix your spare Porsche.

52:55.973 --> 52:59.375
This place is dirty.
I've never been
in here before.

52:59.377 --> 53:00.476
Is that kitty litter?

53:00.478 --> 53:02.144
Soaks up the oil.

53:02.146 --> 53:04.980
What are you
looking for?

53:04.982 --> 53:09.385
Mr. Jimmy has a torch in here
so he can teach basic welding.

53:09.387 --> 53:11.220
How do you know this?

53:11.222 --> 53:13.389
Because I know
where all the good stuff is.

53:13.391 --> 53:15.224
You took industrial arts?

53:15.226 --> 53:17.760
Yep...Shop.

53:17.762 --> 53:20.963
We can't all depend on our
fake hair for career boost.

53:20.965 --> 53:22.765
- This shit is real.
- Hey.

53:24.167 --> 53:25.301
Is that it?

53:25.303 --> 53:27.503
Oh, good eye, Sherlock.

53:27.505 --> 53:30.239
What the heck is it doing
all the way up there?

53:30.241 --> 53:32.575
I'll go.
Ah, its okay, I got it.

53:44.922 --> 53:46.255
Woosh!

53:46.257 --> 53:48.290
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

53:52.462 --> 53:53.996
Sara, don't move!

53:59.470 --> 54:01.537
Oh!

54:58.796 --> 55:00.062
Fuck this!

55:00.064 --> 55:01.397
Faith, no!

55:01.399 --> 55:02.931
I got this.

55:07.637 --> 55:09.738
Faith!
Oh, my god,
I'm gonna be sick.

55:09.740 --> 55:11.874
Faith, there's gotta
be some reason...

55:11.876 --> 55:15.210
Those other kids...
Now us!

55:15.212 --> 55:17.079
All these damn roaches.
This place is cursed.

55:17.081 --> 55:18.747
Those were accidents.

55:18.749 --> 55:20.482
A lethal accident happens
every minute in America.

55:20.484 --> 55:22.718
Not in the same place, moron.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.889
Fine, maybe it is murder.

55:26.891 --> 55:28.891
But what are we
gonna do about it?

55:30.060 --> 55:31.627
We're trapped here.

55:33.229 --> 55:35.631
We have a welding torch.

55:35.633 --> 55:37.499
It may take a while, but...

55:37.501 --> 55:39.401
We can cut
through the doors now.

55:41.171 --> 55:42.705
Yeah.

55:46.910 --> 55:47.976
It works.

55:49.245 --> 55:50.446
Sweet.
Yeah.

55:50.448 --> 55:51.914
It's gonna
take a while, though.

55:51.916 --> 55:54.516
Here, let me help you.
Oh, no, no, no, no can do.

55:55.452 --> 55:57.052
It's man's work.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.522
Siouxsie, come with me.

56:01.124 --> 56:02.524
Hell with that.

56:02.526 --> 56:04.426
Siouxsie, it's the rules.

56:04.428 --> 56:06.328
- What?
- Bathroom rules?

56:06.330 --> 56:08.664
Spookyshit rules?
We don't go alone.

56:24.414 --> 56:26.014
We can't trust Blaine.

56:27.283 --> 56:28.584
What?

56:31.788 --> 56:33.756
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

56:35.291 --> 56:36.558
No!

56:39.062 --> 56:41.096
Does it have to do
with my sister's murder?

56:41.498 --> 56:42.998
Suicide.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.433
And no.

56:46.870 --> 56:48.837
Does it have anything
to do with Blaine?

56:50.573 --> 56:52.040
That was stress.

56:53.910 --> 56:54.977
Oh, shit, you.

56:54.979 --> 56:58.313
Look, I told the cops
she was drunk.

56:58.315 --> 56:59.481
She jumped.

57:03.653 --> 57:05.187
You take the red cup

57:05.189 --> 57:08.624
and I'll show you
how deep the rabbit hole goes.

57:11.060 --> 57:13.429
Moron.
Bitch, please.

57:15.598 --> 57:17.699
That's suicide, Alyson.

57:17.701 --> 57:19.101
What are you thinking?

57:19.103 --> 57:21.670
Siouxsie, you need to stop
getting in my way.

57:25.976 --> 57:28.143
You fucking bitch,
I'll kill you!

57:28.145 --> 57:30.446
Not if I kill myself first.

57:35.685 --> 57:38.787
That was amazing.
What is this?

57:41.424 --> 57:42.724
Where did
these come from?

57:42.726 --> 57:45.027
It's cool, I got them.

57:45.862 --> 57:47.396
Toast?

57:47.398 --> 57:48.764
Toast.

57:56.172 --> 57:59.541
Miss hess! Who said
you could go in this pool?

57:59.543 --> 58:01.643
- She did.
- That girl.

58:01.645 --> 58:04.179
Oh, shit. Cover for me.

58:04.181 --> 58:05.914
Yeah, go, I got him.

58:11.488 --> 58:13.789
Young lady, explain yourself.

58:14.424 --> 58:15.724
Is that alcohol?

58:19.295 --> 58:20.996
It's alcohol.

58:20.998 --> 58:22.231
What happened?

58:22.233 --> 58:23.665
I pushed her.

58:23.667 --> 58:27.336
It's...Crazy.

58:27.338 --> 58:30.172
Her shirt is wet
and her makeup is running.

58:30.174 --> 58:32.407
'Cause she's in the pool.
I know she's in the pool!

58:32.409 --> 58:33.842
Why would you do that?

58:33.844 --> 58:35.611
Hotheaded bitch
needed to cool off.

58:35.613 --> 58:38.547
- What?
- Cool off, bitch!

58:38.549 --> 58:40.516
What, are you all on the dope?

58:40.518 --> 58:42.384
I'm on drugs!

58:42.386 --> 58:43.752
Bull!

58:44.787 --> 58:46.688
Miss Jackson,
see you in detention.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.524
What?
Detention!

58:48.526 --> 58:50.359
First time for everything.

58:50.361 --> 58:52.094
Argh!

59:02.272 --> 59:04.273
You're the best. Come on.

59:07.810 --> 59:10.712
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:10.714 --> 59:12.781
Aly, come on we have to go.
Whoa.

59:12.783 --> 59:14.850
I'm here to have fun
and take interviews,

59:14.852 --> 59:17.586
and I'm all out of fun.

59:17.588 --> 59:18.820
Come here.

59:18.822 --> 59:21.690
Seniors 2015, bitches!
Whoo!

59:23.693 --> 59:28.530
The only thing
that can stop Attila the hen
from winning is a scandal.

59:28.532 --> 59:30.432
Wouldn't that be a shame.

59:30.434 --> 59:32.067
We're gonna find me a scandal.

59:36.139 --> 59:37.673
Hey...

59:37.675 --> 59:39.608
Look who it is.

59:40.543 --> 59:42.077
I got it from Erica.

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.663
Whoa.

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:17.779
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, she jumped!

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.485
Oh, my god, she jumped!

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.754
Oh, she fucking jumped!

01:00:25.756 --> 01:00:28.523
- Help!
- My car!

01:00:28.525 --> 01:00:31.226
Alyson was a bitch.

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:33.996
I mean, she wouldn't stop
writing about our parents.

01:00:33.998 --> 01:00:35.697
But...

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.266
I don't know. I feel...

01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:40.669
No shit, you feel guilty.

01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:42.437
You're a fucking
murderer, faith!

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:44.573
That's not true.
And now Blaine's trying
to kill all of us

01:00:44.575 --> 01:00:46.808
so he can cover up his tracks.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:49.077
No, he's not.

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.513
What?

01:00:51.515 --> 01:00:52.948
My sister gets
into an accident

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:57.219
I... he, uh... he, uh...

01:00:57.221 --> 01:00:59.087
He was trying to hook up
with your slutty sister.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.823
Slutty?
He wouldn't...

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:05.694
No, shit.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:09.798
Shit! Shit! Shit!

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:18.707
Damn. Fast bitch.

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:21.643
Oh, Brian.

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.445
You look as bad as you smell.

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:28.383
Oh, fuck it.

01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:41.129
<i> I love this phone.</i>

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:43.265
<i> I can record</i>
<i> every lie you say</i>

01:01:43.267 --> 01:01:45.867
<i> and immediately email it</i>
<i> to myself at the school.</i>

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:49.538
<i> That's so neat, Alyson.</i>
<i> That's great.</i>

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.874
<i> So what has your daddy</i>
<i> been up to lately?</i>

01:01:52.876 --> 01:01:55.110
<i> I heard he's the next</i>
<i> Billy Graham</i>

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.446
<i> to a certain white house.</i>

01:01:57.448 --> 01:01:59.915
<i> If she wins the nomination.</i>

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:01.216
<i> The only thing</i>
<i> that could stop</i>

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:03.885
<i> Attila the hen from winning</i>
<i> is a scandal.</i>

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.954
<i> Wouldn't that be a shame.</i>

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:08.056
<i> I gotta find me a scandal.</i>

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:12.928
<i> Hey...</i>

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.897
<i> Look who it is.</i>

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.200
I'll take it from here, okay?

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:32.714
Did you like
how I treated my sister?

01:02:32.716 --> 01:02:33.949
Beautiful.

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:36.451
Just like you asked.
Yeah.

01:02:38.321 --> 01:02:42.190
I told you, family is never
as important as success.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:44.326
<i> So I have a little</i>
<i> success, then.</i>

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.528
<i> Yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:48.463
<i> Hey, cheers to that.</i>

01:02:51.134 --> 01:02:52.434
I'm good.

01:02:56.506 --> 01:02:58.073
Okay, then...

01:02:58.075 --> 01:03:00.375
<i> We've already established</i>
<i> that your mother covered up</i>

01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:03.011
<i> the Matt Clark</i>
<i> incident, but...</i>

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.283
Whoa, cowboy.

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.353
Pfft. Sorry.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.189
You just looked
a little stressed.

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:16.491
Fuck that.

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.829
More like...Fuck me,

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:23.932
<i> we are way high up here.</i>

01:03:23.934 --> 01:03:26.601
Yeah. That's the idea!

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:29.504
We get high to relieve stress.

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.107
Get to know each other,

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:34.476
stop stressing over
parents and shit.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:38.346
Stress. Know what I do
when I'm stressed?

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:40.849
What?

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.018
Sex.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.688
You got to be...

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.089
Whoa.

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.561
I really think we should.

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:56.531
I'm...Really good.

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.669
I...

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.405
I wouldn't fuck you
with your mother's dick.

01:04:18.888 --> 01:04:21.389
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god, she jumped!

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.162
Oh, my god, she jumped!

01:04:27.164 --> 01:04:29.764
Help! She fucking jumped!

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:48.316
<i> My car!</i>

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:54.656
Get back. Get back!

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.026
Miss, get away from there!

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:05.433
<i> No! No! No, wait, no!</i>

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:08.136
<i>- Stop! That's my sister!</i>
<i>- Get back!</i>

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.598
You look stressed.

01:05:43.906 --> 01:05:45.540
I'm sorry you saw that.

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.978
Although this was your
plan, I'm guessing.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:53.214
Sneak into detention...

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.383
Steal the video
with your virus.

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:59.854
How did you know?

01:05:59.856 --> 01:06:02.090
'Cause it turns out
I'm a genius.

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.727
I'm a genius.

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:07.462
I mean, shit,
even my mother doesn't know

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:09.531
I'm the one
saving her ass this time.

01:06:11.335 --> 01:06:12.734
I'll let her know
when the time's right.

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:17.172
Say...Around inauguration day.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.643
The others knew?

01:06:21.645 --> 01:06:23.011
Well...

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.714
Not everything.

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:31.252
So you did all of this...

01:06:31.254 --> 01:06:34.422
Because your mother is...
Unstoppable...Yeah.

01:06:34.424 --> 01:06:37.425
And no little pocahontas
bitch says otherwise.

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:40.428
Argh! Argh!

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.630
Ah!

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.337
What the...

01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:56.711
No, faith! Faith!

01:06:56.713 --> 01:06:58.146
Argh! Faith!

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:00.248
Faith, he killed everyone!
He just admitted it!

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:02.050
Blaine?
That is a lie.

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:04.486
This bitch was just
trying to kill me!

01:07:05.454 --> 01:07:06.855
Oh, my god,
that's why she's here.

01:07:06.857 --> 01:07:08.523
That's why she's here.

01:07:08.525 --> 01:07:11.159
She snuck in
and poisoned Brian.

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.595
Then she rigged that
saw to killed Sara.

01:07:13.597 --> 01:07:15.130
No! No, he...

01:07:15.132 --> 01:07:17.332
I have never killed anybody,
you sexist pig!

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.200
She asked you
to confess, right?

01:07:19.202 --> 01:07:21.503
Right. The second
you were alone.

01:07:22.973 --> 01:07:25.807
Do you really think
you can trust
this under crust?

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:33.615
Faith.

01:07:33.617 --> 01:07:35.784
Faith, no! He...

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:37.886
He needs to pay!

01:07:37.888 --> 01:07:41.456
Faith, this bitch
was just trying to kill me!

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.691
Think about it. Okay...

01:07:43.693 --> 01:07:45.627
Even if we're partly
responsible for her suicide,

01:07:45.629 --> 01:07:47.529
I just wanted her sister
to know us better.

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:50.765
Who knew psycho bitch
ran in the family?

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.468
Like Alyson,

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.503
this tramp is out
for our blood!

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:00.508
You lied to me?

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:06.881
No. No, I have nothing
to do with any of this shit.

01:08:06.883 --> 01:08:08.650
It has all been him!

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.256
I...I can prove it.
The only reason
we're still here

01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:18.126
is because we don't have
our phones, right?

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.694
Well, if I was the killer...

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:22.697
If... if I was the killer,
then would I have done this?

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:27.035
If you were the killer, yeah.

01:08:27.037 --> 01:08:28.903
Who the fuck is that?

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:31.272
I don't understand.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.974
The phones were supposed
to be in there.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.742
Phones?

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.243
You have our phones?

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:40.448
Dr. knight.
I know where Dr. knight is.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.785
Follow me!

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:45.453
This should be good.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.889
In order for my plan to work,

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.791
I had to get rid of Dr. knight
for a few hours.

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:59.634
Argh! Dammit,
stop showing us this shit!

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:02.904
That's not right.
Hell, no, that's not right!

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:04.639
That's hardcore.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:07.575
Faith, he killed them too.

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.310
I don't know how he
did it, but he did.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.312
Convincing.
It was not me.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:13.348
Okay. Something weird
is going on here.

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.316
You said so yourself
that this school is cursed!

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.118
A curse?
Really, sioux, a curse?

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.786
That is so convincing.
Shut up!

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.822
Whatever is in Blaine,
he gets from this school.

01:09:20.823 --> 01:09:22.957
And he won't stop.
She's obviously deranged.

01:09:22.959 --> 01:09:25.359
The roaches? The deaths?

01:09:25.362 --> 01:09:28.462
Okay. It's his family!
His whole fucking
family is cursed!

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:31.933
I said shut the fuck up.

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:34.301
Blaine, stop!

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:36.337
I... I just told her
to shut up.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.242
He's going down, faith.

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:44.612
And so is whoever
stands next to him.

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:52.886
Wait.

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:02.230
It's all so clear now.

01:10:03.799 --> 01:10:07.235
All white people
are fucking crazy.

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.970
Fuck this honky shit!

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.574
Fuck you, psychojawea.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:15.009
And fuck you, needle dick.

01:10:15.011 --> 01:10:16.444
Oh, faith.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:19.113
I'll find my own way out.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:20.381
No, I don't think you will.

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.517
No!

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:33.027
Goddamn.

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:34.629
Bitches be crazy.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.799
Where was I?

01:10:48.377 --> 01:10:50.445
What was I saying?
What was I saying?

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:54.549
Oh, oh, you'll like this.
You'll like this.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:56.384
You're taking all the blame.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:11:00.688
See, you...

01:11:00.690 --> 01:11:02.257
Were the girl
trying to kill us,

01:11:02.259 --> 01:11:03.658
the real victims here.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:10.031
You're the girl
seen fighting with her sister

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.165
the night she died.

01:11:11.167 --> 01:11:13.768
Ooh, that's, mmm...

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:16.170
And you're partying on
top of Nash's car

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:18.606
like a fucking
welder gone wild.

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:24.312
And you're the girl
who hacked into crestview

01:11:25.180 --> 01:11:26.514
and started killing people.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:28.283
You started killing people?

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:30.351
Wh...Wha...

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:34.989
Seriously?

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:39.460
The school will love me.
They'll love me.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:42.063
And then the press
will love me too.

01:11:43.365 --> 01:11:44.832
And then my mother.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.337
Then my mother will love me.

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.939
You're insane.

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:53.474
Really?

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:56.544
'Cause right now,
I'm looking pretty good.

01:12:08.223 --> 01:12:10.892
Are we there...Yet?

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:12.827
Welcome back, baby.

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.332
Just in time to say goodbye.

01:12:19.835 --> 01:12:21.102
Goodbye.

01:12:22.838 --> 01:12:23.938
I'll kill you.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:26.908
Uh, no. No, I don't...

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:29.844
See, you only try to.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.880
Here, I'll give you
the liner notes.

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:36.417
Did you really think
that you had enough money

01:12:36.419 --> 01:12:39.354
to pay the naked wizard
to hack the school?

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:42.724
Come on.

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:44.792
Getting you into detention,

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:48.529
and making you look crazy
'cause you look crazy,

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.331
that sets the tone.

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:54.102
And then I paid my way
into detention

01:12:54.104 --> 01:12:56.170
and I take
care of my problems.

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:00.108
Don't tase me, bitch!

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:15.890
Ah! Oh, my god!

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:17.425
There...

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:19.494
There's no way
you're that smart.

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.998
Whose car
do you think this is?

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.400
Keep the change.

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.470
Sweet. A Benjamin.

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:32.306
Oh, shit,
what do we have here?

01:13:47.923 --> 01:13:49.457
Hello, mother.
I'm still in detention,

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:51.058
and I can't really
talk right now.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.427
Mrs. wilkes...

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.998
Where...
Did I get the phones?

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.735
Um, where you left them
in the closet, dumb bitch.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.639
That's a damn shame.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:26.093
Faith!

01:14:26.095 --> 01:14:27.929
Told you my hair was real.

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:38.473
No.
Yes.

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:40.641
No...
Yes. Yes!

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.828
Oh, what the...
Son of a bitch!

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:42.770
<i> Come on!</i>
<i> Where you even going?</i>

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:48.042
Fe, fi, fo, fum, bitch.

01:15:52.047 --> 01:15:53.814
Marco...

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.617
Marco?

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.954
You're supposed to say Polo.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.356
<i> 911.</i>
Hello?

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:03.658
Hi, this is siouxsie hess.

01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:04.892
I go to
crestview academy and...

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:08.262
<i> Please hold.</i>
Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit.

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:37.491
We both know there's nothing
good in the chemistry lab.

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:39.360
Hmm?

01:16:39.362 --> 01:16:41.896
Oh, really?
Whoa, what the...

01:16:41.898 --> 01:16:43.397
Where the fuck
did you get that?

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:46.167
Like I said, I know
where all the good stuff is.

01:16:46.169 --> 01:16:47.368
Oh, yeah? Bullshit.

01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:48.569
Face it, preppie,

01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:49.837
you're gonna die
in this school

01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:50.905
just like your sister did.

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.273
What are you talking about?

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:53.774
My sister was killed
by a lowlife schizoid.

01:16:53.776 --> 01:16:56.143
No, Alyson found
out the truth.

01:16:56.145 --> 01:16:57.678
She interviewed Max.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.380
He told her everything.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:01.882
So?

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.251
So?
So?

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:05.786
Your mother paid him off.

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.456
She killed the story
and your sister!

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:09.590
Dead men tell no tales.

01:17:09.592 --> 01:17:11.559
Well, duh!

01:17:11.561 --> 01:17:12.827
What d'you think
we're doing here?

01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:14.362
Are you stupid or something?

01:17:14.364 --> 01:17:16.263
Am I stupid or something? No.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:17.898
I'm a cockwalking genius!

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.340
You should get that.

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.143
Pick that up.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:30.211
Pick...

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:36.417
Hello?

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:38.252
<i> Hello, siouxsie dear.</i>

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:39.720
Senator wilkes?

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:41.188
But how...
<i> Never mind that.</i>

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.090
<i> May I speak</i>
<i> with my son, please?</i>

01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:46.160
He's a little busy right now.
<i> I understand that,</i>

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.496
<i> but if you would like to</i>
<i> survive the next few minutes,</i>

01:17:48.498 --> 01:17:51.132
<i> it's best you let me</i>
<i> speak to him, dear.</i>

01:17:51.967 --> 01:17:53.434
It's your mom.
Yeah, I know

01:17:53.436 --> 01:17:54.835
okay.

01:17:58.141 --> 01:17:59.340
Hello, mother. I'm almost
done with detention.

01:17:59.342 --> 01:18:00.441
<i> Listen carefully, son.</i>

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:01.776
Mother.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:04.378
Mother, I am going
to make you so proud.

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.370
<i> Blaine!</i>

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.872
Yes, mother, where were we?

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.943
It's best you come
home now, dear.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.279
No, not yet. I'm almost done.

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:39.280
Mom, let me just...

01:18:39.282 --> 01:18:42.016
Let me show you,
let me just show you.

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:43.718
Here, I'll show you.

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:53.027
<i> What is this?</i>
Mom, that...

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:56.931
That is literally
the last of your problems.

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.834
Listen very carefully, son.

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:01.736
<i> No, see, mom, this time,</i>
<i> I'm proving to you</i>

01:19:01.738 --> 01:19:03.437
you don't need your helpers
to tie loose ends.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:06.040
This time, it was me.
See, these are pictures of...

01:19:06.042 --> 01:19:08.142
<i> Siouxsie hess.</i>
<i> I know who she is.</i>

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.448
How?
Because I framed her.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.617
<i> What? No.</i>

01:19:16.619 --> 01:19:18.652
No, you don't know this girl.
This is a nothing under crust.

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:21.155
<i> Blaine...</i>
No, see, mom, this time...

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:24.925
Mom, I've made it so this one
looks utterly crazy.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.661
Just like that scumbag
who killed tricia.

01:19:27.663 --> 01:19:29.363
And this time...

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:31.565
In the story, I'm the hero
who saves the day.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:33.467
I'm the hero, mom.

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:35.469
I'm a genius!

01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:38.973
Ugh, you and your sister
were never very bright.

01:19:38.975 --> 01:19:41.008
Fuck you, mother, it was me.

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:44.078
<i> Your father's chromosomes</i>
<i> really polluted the</i>
<i> gene pool, as it were.</i>

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:45.780
You decrepit old
hag, it was me!

01:19:45.782 --> 01:19:47.381
<i> I'm the big winner here.</i>

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.217
Old.

01:19:55.824 --> 01:19:57.491
I've seen enough.

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:58.592
<i> We're done here, dear.</i>

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:00.795
Wait, what? What? Like...

01:20:00.797 --> 01:20:02.129
<i> Like with my project?</i>

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.565
I mean like...

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:05.800
<i> I'm cutting you loose.</i>

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:08.936
Mom?

01:20:09.604 --> 01:20:11.005
Mom?

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.141
Ah, shit.

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:16.744
Hey, Blaine,
suck this, motherfucker!

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:28.489
You fucking whore!

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:30.658
<i> We have a problem.</i>

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:31.725
Problem?

01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:36.430
Good. We all know
you wanna work for me.

01:20:36.432 --> 01:20:40.668
The question is whether or not
you're willing to do wet work.

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:44.038
Wait, do we really...
This isn't up for discussion.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:46.740
Let me rephrase the question.

01:20:46.742 --> 01:20:48.909
Do you wanna be very rich...

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.178
Or do you wanna die poor?

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.013
Right now.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.952
I suggest plan b.

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.625
I'll take the white moron
that killed my baby.

01:21:37.627 --> 01:21:39.827
You take the Indian.
I want a piece
of that action.

01:21:55.844 --> 01:21:58.479
Ooh, honey.

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:28.309
God's will.

01:22:28.977 --> 01:22:30.244
Amen.

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.673
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:01.275
Pick up, pick up...

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.510
Pick up, pick up.

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.816
Yes, dear.
<i> Mom, mom!</i>

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:11.218
I don't think you're seeing
the big picture here.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:14.121
<i> Sweetheart,</i>
<i> I see everything.</i>

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:17.157
Blainy.

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:37.511
Oh, dear.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:45.285
Oh.

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:58.032
My leg!

01:24:01.669 --> 01:24:03.370
Ah! Mother...

01:24:03.372 --> 01:24:05.239
Here, let me
help you out with that.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:08.842
Help. Help!

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:10.677
<i> Oh, sweetie,</i>

01:24:10.679 --> 01:24:12.780
<i> there's really nothing</i>
<i> to be done.</i>

01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:16.216
<i> I'm afraid you and miss hess</i>
<i> are completely surrounded,</i>

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:19.686
and have really taken
everything a little too far.

01:24:22.024 --> 01:24:23.891
Mo... mother. Mother?

01:24:23.893 --> 01:24:25.325
<i> Oh, siouxsie</i>
<i> dear, that won't work.</i>

01:24:37.372 --> 01:24:39.640
<i> Blainy, you're not a genius.</i>

01:24:39.642 --> 01:24:42.776
Frankly, your work here has
been sloppy and embarrassing.

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:45.913
But...But she...I'm a gen...

01:24:45.915 --> 01:24:49.083
<i> Honey, do you really think all</i>
<i> of this just happened?</i>

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:51.318
No loose ends?

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.720
Sweetie, you're more frayed
than a persian rug.

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:57.391
<i> Do you really think</i>
<i> I don't know about the sluts</i>
<i> you brought to the penthouse</i>

01:24:57.393 --> 01:25:00.127
<i> and who exposed his cockiness</i>
<i> all over town?</i>

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:02.996
Keep the change.
Sweet. A Benjamin.

01:25:02.998 --> 01:25:04.998
Let's go buy glue!

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.969
Mother. Mother, I...
<i> Blaine!</i>

01:25:08.971 --> 01:25:10.771
Mother knows all.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.631
<i> I'm afraid this time, blainy,</i>

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:40.334
<i> my cleanup</i>
<i> is going to include you.</i>

01:25:40.336 --> 01:25:43.670
No. Mother...

01:25:43.672 --> 01:25:45.672
There were some
flaws, I know,

01:25:45.674 --> 01:25:49.309
but my plan to make me a hero
was so...Was so cool.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:53.313
But you as a martyr
is so much better, pumpkin.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:56.183
Please, mom, no, mom.
Please. Mother, please!

01:25:56.185 --> 01:26:00.120
Please.
I'm sor...

01:26:00.122 --> 01:26:02.055
<i> Quit your whining.</i>

01:26:02.057 --> 01:26:04.358
<i> Honestly, Blaine,</i>

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:06.627
killing you is
a favor to us both.

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.398
Ah!

01:26:14.904 --> 01:26:17.204
<i> Oh-oh.</i>

01:26:17.206 --> 01:26:19.740
<i> I know what you're</i>
<i> planning, miss hess.</i>

01:26:19.742 --> 01:26:21.742
And I know that you covered up
your daughter's murder.

01:26:21.744 --> 01:26:24.745
<i> There's something...</i>

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:28.782
<i> You young people can't seem</i>
<i> to wrap your brain around.</i>

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:31.652
<i> Your egos and the media</i>
<i> have led you astray,</i>

01:26:31.654 --> 01:26:34.755
<i> lying that your</i>
<i> experiences are special.</i>

01:26:34.757 --> 01:26:36.823
<i> I would call them</i>
<i> predictable.</i>

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:38.492
<i> Parents always know</i>
<i> what their kids are</i>
<i> going to do</i>

01:26:38.494 --> 01:26:40.627
<i> even before they do it.</i>
Ah...

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:43.030
No, you don't.

01:26:43.032 --> 01:26:44.631
<i> Yes, I do.</i>

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:47.367
No, you don't.
<i> Yes, I do.</i>

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:49.736
<i> Little girl,</i>

01:26:49.738 --> 01:26:52.739
who do you think put
you on the detention
list this morning?

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:55.008
The only thing that boy
could hack is his Johnson.

01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:57.644
Taking care of business.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:04.284
<i> And let me be absolutely clear</i>
<i> about what you control.</i>

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.687
<i> Nothing.</i>

01:27:06.689 --> 01:27:08.388
<i> Zero.</i>

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:11.525
<i> Ziltcho.</i>

01:27:11.527 --> 01:27:14.595
<i> And let me assure you,</i>
<i> siouxsie hess,</i>

01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:16.563
you will never leave
this school alive.

01:27:17.265 --> 01:27:19.533
Just watch me, bitch.

01:27:26.342 --> 01:27:27.741
Don't leave me.

01:27:29.178 --> 01:27:30.544
I wasn't planning on it.

01:28:02.644 --> 01:28:04.544
Plan c.

01:28:04.546 --> 01:28:08.248
<i> Do you wanna know the</i>
<i> difference between an</i>
<i> amateur and a professional?</i>

01:28:08.250 --> 01:28:10.317
So long, bitch.

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:31.438
<i> Welcome back, baby.</i>

01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:33.707
<i> When I have</i>
<i> my proof, they'll burn.</i>

01:28:35.978 --> 01:28:38.312
<i> This will be safe</i>
<i> yet fun for us all.</i>

01:28:40.082 --> 01:28:42.316
<i> I know</i>
<i> what you're planning,</i>
<i> miss hess.</i>

01:28:42.318 --> 01:28:45.018
<i> This thing just got</i>
<i> a lot more interesting.</i>

01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:47.187
<i> Who do you think</i>
<i> put you on the detention list?</i>

01:28:50.392 --> 01:28:53.093
<i> The world needs to know!</i>

01:28:57.666 --> 01:29:01.168
<i> This shit is real.</i>
<i> Spooky shit...</i>

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:02.769
<i> Who the fuck is that?</i>

01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:05.372
<i> Psycho bitch</i>
<i> ran in the family?</i>

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.107
<i> The roaches? The deaths?</i>

01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:08.375
<i> Tell my mother you love me.</i>

01:29:08.377 --> 01:29:10.911
<i> It's all so clear now.</i>
<i> Yes.</i>

01:29:10.913 --> 01:29:12.646
<i> No!</i>

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:15.048
<i> You look stressed.</i>

01:29:25.793 --> 01:29:27.027
I...

01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:22.309
Hands up!

01:31:22.311 --> 01:31:23.710
You know the drill.

01:31:28.784 --> 01:31:30.917
She is not giving up.

01:31:30.919 --> 01:31:33.787
Tell her
she's not gonna do anything.

01:31:33.789 --> 01:31:37.190
You are not going
to do anything!

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:43.163
She is still not moving.

01:31:43.165 --> 01:31:45.065
<i> Say that she's</i>
<i> going to turn herself in</i>
<i> like the last one.</i>

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:50.670
You are going to turn
yourself in like the last one.

01:31:51.205 --> 01:31:52.572
Nice...

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:54.274
And slow.

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:57.511
Go to hell.

01:31:57.513 --> 01:32:00.647
<i> For Chris sake,</i>
<i> you know what I pay</i>
<i> you for. Clean it up.</i>

01:32:02.617 --> 01:32:03.984
Open fire!

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:29.576
Ah!

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:50.063
Tell senator wilkes...

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:51.831
To suck my dick!

01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:31.104
<i> I mean, this is bad.</i>
<i> This is worse than before</i> .

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:34.941
<i> I mean, this is excessive.</i>
It's absolutely awful.

01:33:34.943 --> 01:33:39.045
For that girl to think she can
kill all these innocent people
and get away scot-free.

01:33:39.047 --> 01:33:42.115
Frankly, senator,
i am sick of it.
As am I.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:44.317
Something has to be done.
Absolutely.

01:33:44.319 --> 01:33:47.754
Excuse me, can you wait
just a moment, please?

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:55.695
Oh!

01:33:55.697 --> 01:33:58.098
Oh, my baby!

01:33:59.534 --> 01:34:03.136
Oh, my poor baby!

01:34:03.138 --> 01:34:05.438
Got it?

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.506
Yes, ma'am.

01:34:06.508 --> 01:34:07.774
Ugh.

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:10.343
Ugh.

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:13.380
Anyway.

01:34:13.382 --> 01:34:16.016
Listen, we need to talk
about how to fix this.

01:34:16.018 --> 01:34:19.252
I'm talking permanently.
Yes, we do.

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:21.054
I'm sorry, senator.
I don't think another,

01:34:21.056 --> 01:34:23.356
donation is gonna get
rid of all of this.

01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:26.326
Well you haven't seen how many
zeros are in that check.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:28.895
I'm talking excessive.

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:31.364
Excessive.

01:34:33.568 --> 01:34:35.568
Where the fuck is Dr. knight?

01:35:08.336 --> 01:35:10.036
Hello, baby.

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:12.439
Oh, I've missed you so much.

01:35:12.441 --> 01:35:14.507
Who the fu...
Shhh...

01:35:18.612 --> 01:35:20.180
They see everything.

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.062
Brought you something.

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:53.947
What the hell?

01:35:53.949 --> 01:35:55.482
<i> Gonna get you out of here.</i>

01:35:57.151 --> 01:35:58.918
We've got some shit to do.

01:40:54.082 --> 01:40:57.483
Is he one of ours?

01:40:57.485 --> 01:41:00.119
I don't think so.
Good thing I got him.

01:41:00.121 --> 01:41:02.488
I got him.
I got him first.

01:41:02.490 --> 01:41:04.357
No, I got him first.
No, I got him first.

01:41:04.359 --> 01:41:06.092
How many times
we gonna do this?

01:41:06.094 --> 01:41:08.261
A lot. And every single
time, I'm gonna be the
one who got him first.

01:41:08.263 --> 01:41:09.562
Okay, whatever helps
you sleep at night.

01:41:09.564 --> 01:41:10.763
Yeah.
