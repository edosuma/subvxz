(DOOR BELL DINGS)

00:11.500 --> 00:14.250
-KEVIN: Hello, Mr. Kim.
-Kevin, how I can help you?

00:14.291 --> 00:16.417
-This is my friend, Roger.
-Hello, Roger.

00:16.458 --> 00:17.542
-Nice to meet you.
-Mmm.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.667
We are performing
for Pride Week,

00:19.709 --> 00:21.625
and we would love to put
our poster up in your window.

00:26.709 --> 00:29.583
You group is call,
"Gay Town Boys?"

00:29.625 --> 00:31.959
Yes, it is, and, yes, we are.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.709
It's, uh, messy poster.
Who make?

00:35.750 --> 00:37.041
Get refund.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.417
-Or is it because we're gay?
-No, of course, it isn't.

00:40.458 --> 00:41.583
It's okay. Don't mind him.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.750
No. I have no problem
with the gay,

00:43.792 --> 00:46.083
but I have problem
with parade.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.709
Traffic, garbage, noise.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.083
If you is the gay,

00:50.125 --> 00:52.750
why can't you be quiet,
respectful gay, huh?

00:52.792 --> 00:54.875
Like Anderson Cooper,
you know?

00:54.917 --> 00:56.750
Neil Patrick Harris,
you know?

00:56.792 --> 00:57.959
They is all the gay,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.250
but they don't yelling to me
they is the gay.

01:00.291 --> 01:01.417
It's not about being loud,
Mr. Kim...

01:01.458 --> 01:04.166
Kevin, some people
don't like Korean,

01:04.208 --> 01:06.875
but we don't make big parade
yelling at people,

01:06.917 --> 01:09.291
"We is Korean, we is Korean!"
(CHUCKLES)

01:09.333 --> 01:11.959
-Mr. Kim, are you homophobic?
-Roger.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.875
-What word you using?
-Homophobic, Mr. Kim.

01:14.917 --> 01:17.500
This is discrimination
against "the homos."

01:17.542 --> 01:19.417
And it's a hate crime,
and I'm gonna report it.

01:19.458 --> 01:20.583
-What?
-Roger...

01:20.625 --> 01:22.709
-What you report?
-Hey! Look, look, look.

01:23.875 --> 01:25.500
I'm not homo...

01:25.542 --> 01:27.375
-Homopebek.
-Uh-huh.

01:27.417 --> 01:28.500
If I am homo...

01:28.542 --> 01:31.583
Homopeebeek, then why I...

01:34.000 --> 01:36.250
Why do I give
a gay discount, hmm?

01:37.291 --> 01:38.709
-Sorry?
-Yeah.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.709
If I am homo, homopobok,

01:40.750 --> 01:43.250
then why I having
the gay discount?

01:43.291 --> 01:47.083
Fifteen percent gay discount
only for the Gay Pride Week.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.208
So, how much would this be?

01:52.208 --> 01:54.959
Regular, $2,
but for you,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.625
with gay discount,
$1.70.

01:57.667 --> 01:59.542
And how do you know
if someone is gay?

02:00.375 --> 02:01.500
I can tell.

02:02.291 --> 02:04.583
-You have gaydar, Mr. Kim?
-Yeah.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.166
I have gaydar, 100% guarantee.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.500
Ah. Well, we'll be sure
to spread the word.

02:10.542 --> 02:11.959
And the poster?

02:13.458 --> 02:14.959
You can do better.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.959
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:46.208 --> 02:48.417
Appa, I have a shoot
for school this weekend.

02:48.458 --> 02:49.834
I was wondering
if I can borrow the van.

02:49.875 --> 02:52.125
What happened to,
"Good morning, Appa,"

02:52.166 --> 02:53.750
"Umma, you look pretty today."

02:53.792 --> 02:55.500
-Thank you, Appa.
-That's from Janet.

02:55.542 --> 02:56.750
Oh. Thank you, Janet.

02:56.792 --> 02:58.000
But I say.

02:58.041 --> 03:00.542
You do look pretty Umma,
and can I have the van?

03:00.583 --> 03:01.667
-No.
-No, but Appa,

03:01.709 --> 03:03.125
-I only need it for one...
-Stop.

03:03.917 --> 03:04.959
One second.

03:09.583 --> 03:10.583
(DOOR CLOSING)

03:10.625 --> 03:12.083

(SIGHS)

03:12.125 --> 03:13.583
-Janet.
-What?

03:13.625 --> 03:14.792
You coming church Sunday?

03:16.166 --> 03:18.875
You know, church is not
only for worship the Jesus.

03:18.917 --> 03:21.083
Lots of side benefit too.

03:21.125 --> 03:24.083
You can make a lot
of friends at church.

03:24.125 --> 03:27.375
Friend who is girl.
Friend who is not girl.

03:27.792 --> 03:30.208
Umma, I'm not going to church
to hook up with guys.

03:30.250 --> 03:32.750
Not hook up, hook around.

03:33.917 --> 03:36.291
Look, new church directory.

03:36.333 --> 03:38.667
So many boys to choose from.

03:38.709 --> 03:39.959
Oh.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.166
Mr. Soon's nephew, Georgie.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.250
He is captain of church
Frisbee team.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.709
Umma, I don't need your help
finding a boyfriend.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.208
Yeah. Then where is you cool
Christian Korean boyfriend?

03:49.250 --> 03:51.333
Okay, first of all,
there's no such thing

03:51.375 --> 03:52.875
as a "Cool Christian
Korean Boy."

03:52.917 --> 03:54.542
-They don't exist.
-(SCOFFS) What you talking?

03:54.583 --> 03:56.500
If they're cool and Christian,
they're not Korean.

03:56.542 --> 03:57.792
And if they're cool
and Korean,

03:57.834 --> 03:59.625
they're not Christian.
And if they're cool,

03:59.667 --> 04:01.208
Christian and Korean,
they're girls.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.709
Jung is cool, Christian,
and Korean. Is he girl?

04:04.750 --> 04:06.417
So, you're suggesting
I date my brother?

04:06.959 --> 04:08.375
No.

04:08.417 --> 04:11.208
Look, Janet,
when I was your age,

04:11.250 --> 04:13.542
I go to church,
find the Jesus,

04:13.583 --> 04:17.333
find cool, Christian
Korean boy and we hook around.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.834
Umma, can you please don't say
"hook around."

04:18.875 --> 04:20.041
It doesn't sound so good.

04:20.834 --> 04:22.709
If I is not hook around
with you Appa,

04:22.750 --> 04:24.834
-you is not be born.
-Bye, Umma.

I was told you
were supporting gay pride

04:39.333 --> 04:41.792
and you had a 50% discount
or something like that?

04:41.834 --> 04:43.125
Is that true or not?

04:43.166 --> 04:44.375
What?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.917
You have a 50% discount
or something like that?

04:46.959 --> 04:49.250
-Is that true?
-Fifteen percent.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.166
And keep talking
to end of sentence.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.208
My bad. Sorry. (LAUGHS)

04:53.250 --> 04:55.625
Fifteen percent
discount, true?

04:55.667 --> 04:57.625
Yeah, only for the gay.

04:57.667 --> 04:59.417
$26.50. You want bag?

05:01.208 --> 05:02.792
Is that with the discount?

05:02.834 --> 05:04.709
No, you want bag?

05:04.750 --> 05:06.375
Uh, yes, I want the bag

05:06.417 --> 05:08.291
but why not I get
the gay discount?

05:08.333 --> 05:09.875
It's only for the gay.

05:09.917 --> 05:11.667
You is not the gay.

05:11.709 --> 05:12.959
Hello.

05:13.041 --> 05:16.458
I am not the gay?
I am so the gay.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.375
People tell me
I am too gay sometimes.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.583
You is only pretend.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.542
Are you for real?

05:21.583 --> 05:24.834
One hundred percent
guarantee not gay.

05:24.875 --> 05:26.375
No discount.

05:26.417 --> 05:27.542
This is not over.

05:29.458 --> 05:32.792
This is not even the start
of it being not over.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.291
Okay. See you.

05:37.709 --> 05:38.750
Hi.

05:47.041 --> 05:48.083
You pick it up.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.125

05:50.166 --> 05:51.333

-JANET: Hey.
-Hey.

05:53.875 --> 05:54.917
What are you guys doing?

05:54.959 --> 05:56.458
Your brother's
about to clean a car.

05:56.500 --> 05:57.875
You guys gettin' lunch
or something?

05:57.917 --> 05:59.375
-I don't know, are we?
-Mmm.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.834
My treat as long as you use

06:01.875 --> 06:03.250
your employee family
discount thingy

06:03.291 --> 06:04.458
to get me a car.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.542
What's wrong with Appa's van?

06:05.583 --> 06:06.875
More like, "What's wrong
with Appa?"

06:06.917 --> 06:08.834
I'm 20 and he still won't
let me drive the van.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.041
I drove the van when I was 13.

06:10.083 --> 06:11.709
You stole the van
when you were 13.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.583
No, we stole the van
when he was 13.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.333
Technically, if your family
owns it, it's not stealing.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.500
So, can you get me a rental?

06:18.542 --> 06:20.291
Depends. Where you gonna
wine and dine me?

06:21.083 --> 06:22.625
Come on, you owe me.

06:22.667 --> 06:24.083
For what?

06:24.125 --> 06:26.333
I'm seriously over-parented
because you're not around.

06:26.375 --> 06:28.208
Hey, I still get more than
my fair share from Umma.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.375
Yeah, but when's the last time
you talked to Appa?

06:31.875 --> 06:33.208
When's the last time
he talked to me?

06:33.250 --> 06:34.834
So you're never going
to talk to him again?

06:34.875 --> 06:35.959
It's workin' so far.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.792
Hey, I just got
a strange call...

06:38.625 --> 06:39.667
Hi.

06:39.709 --> 06:40.834
Who's this?

06:40.875 --> 06:43.166
This is my sister Janet.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.667
She's taking me to lunch.

06:44.709 --> 06:48.792
Sister. Hi, Janet.
I'm Shannon, Jung's manager.

06:48.834 --> 06:50.333
And, I like to think, friend.

06:50.375 --> 06:53.709
And as a friend, I should
tell you the manager,

06:53.750 --> 06:56.000
would say it's employees
only back here.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.333
I get it. Sorry.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.125
I know it must be hard
for two people

06:59.166 --> 07:02.834
who grew up in the inner city
and are rebellious by nature,

07:02.875 --> 07:05.250
but rules are rules.
Understood?

07:06.333 --> 07:07.875
-Understood.
-Good.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.250
Understood.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.041
"Understood in the hood."

07:14.625 --> 07:17.333
Okay, really nice to meet you.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.917
Oh, and the strange call.

07:19.959 --> 07:22.041
A woman asked,
if we've seen her pet ferret.

07:23.917 --> 07:25.083
Yeah, I'm gonna say no.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.208
Okay.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.959
And look what the cat drag in.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.583
Oh, Mr. Chin.

07:32.625 --> 07:33.834
How's it going?

07:33.875 --> 07:35.041
Uh, can't complain.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.458
How's your business?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.500
Which one?

07:37.542 --> 07:38.667
(BOTH LAUGHING)

07:38.709 --> 07:40.625
Kidding aside, Mr. Kim,

07:40.667 --> 07:43.000
business has never
been better.

07:43.041 --> 07:45.667
Gay Pride week, very busy.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.125
Yeah, me too.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.375
Gays are good for business.
Hmm.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.333
Ah. Remember when we start?

07:52.083 --> 07:53.333
No gay in sight.

07:53.375 --> 07:54.667
Where they all come from?

07:54.709 --> 07:56.792
Immigration? Refugee?

07:56.834 --> 07:58.625
It's more popular now.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.500
Everybody switch side.

08:00.542 --> 08:02.041
Man becoming woman,

08:02.083 --> 08:04.417
woman dressing like man
who like woman.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.917
So confusing.

08:06.542 --> 08:10.291
For example, if a gay man
discover he is transsexual...

08:10.333 --> 08:11.667
Yeah.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.625
...then if he has sex change
and becomes a woman...

08:13.667 --> 08:15.166
-Okay.
-...then discover

08:15.208 --> 08:17.417
she is actually transgender...

08:17.458 --> 08:18.875
Wait.

08:18.917 --> 08:22.291
What's difference between
transgender and transsexual?

08:22.959 --> 08:25.208
Hmm. I don't know, Mr. Kim.

08:25.250 --> 08:27.375
What is the difference
between a transgender

08:27.417 --> 08:28.583
and a transsexual?

08:28.625 --> 08:31.083
No, is not a joke, Mr. Chin.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.333
I ask you real question.
I don't know.

08:33.375 --> 08:34.834
Excuse me.

08:34.875 --> 08:36.917
The word up on the street is
you having 15% discount,

08:36.959 --> 08:38.000
for true?

08:38.041 --> 08:39.417
What?

08:39.458 --> 08:40.583
What what?

08:40.625 --> 08:41.875
No. Sorry, I don't...

08:42.625 --> 08:44.291
I can't catch hear
what you talking.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.834
What I talkin'?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.208
No one can understand

08:47.250 --> 08:48.792
what you both
talking about it!

08:51.083 --> 08:52.375
Lord have mercy!

08:52.417 --> 08:56.542
Me just want to know if
the 15% discount be true?

08:56.583 --> 08:58.583
Yeah, it's true
but only for the gay.

08:58.917 --> 09:02.500
What? That's illegal.
Anti-straight.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.250
Well, when's me get
me discount then?

09:06.333 --> 09:08.625
Uh, February.

09:08.667 --> 09:10.166
Black History Discount Month.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.583
That's the shortest month
of the year.

09:12.625 --> 09:14.458
But it's longer
during leap year.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.000
So, take full advantage.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.083
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you come in.

09:31.125 --> 09:34.166
It's okay. Just wanted to drop
off my resume.

09:34.208 --> 09:37.041
-(DOOR OPENS)
-Hi, I'm here about the job.

09:37.834 --> 09:39.208
-Oh. Um...
-Here we go.

09:39.250 --> 09:41.542
