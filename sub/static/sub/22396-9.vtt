00:08.749 --> 00:11.666
Oh, Mickey, this has been
such a lovely ride.

00:11.666 --> 00:14.124
You said it. We'll just stop
here to get our whistle wet

00:14.124 --> 00:16.124
and then, off into the sunset.

00:16.124 --> 00:17.624
Gee, Mickey.

00:17.624 --> 00:20.124
This kind of seems like a biker hangout.

00:20.124 --> 00:21.416
No sweat.

00:21.416 --> 00:23.666
I'm a biker too.
Right, scoot?

00:28.374 --> 00:31.374
Uh, two milkshakes, please.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.374
Are you going to see the sunset?

00:33.374 --> 00:34.582
My boyfriend's taking me.

00:34.582 --> 00:36.416
He's a biker too, you know.

00:36.749 --> 00:38.041
Oh, you boys talk.

00:38.041 --> 00:39.166
I'll be right back.

00:39.166 --> 00:41.790
So, you're a biker, huh?

00:41.790 --> 00:44.083
No! I mean, yeah, a biker.

00:48.208 --> 00:49.749
What are you ridin'?

00:49.749 --> 00:51.416
Meep.

01:09.374 --> 01:11.166
You're gonna pay for that!

01:11.166 --> 01:13.582
Pay? Splendid idea, yeah.
I'll pay for everything.

01:13.582 --> 01:15.166
Starting with a round of drinks!

01:15.166 --> 01:16.707
Excuse me, pardon me.
Oh...

01:16.707 --> 01:18.000
Barkeep!

01:23.208 --> 01:24.291
Hmm.

01:24.291 --> 01:25.874
Hey, little lady,

01:25.874 --> 01:29.457
your boyfriend went ahead
to set up that sunset for you.

01:30.166 --> 01:32.041
He asked us to bring you there.

01:32.041 --> 01:33.457
That's so sweet of him!

01:34.083 --> 01:35.749
And a new round of milkshakes.

01:36.291 --> 01:38.000
Hello?
Minnie?

01:39.832 --> 01:41.416
What is it, boy?

01:42.374 --> 01:43.582
Minnie was, what...

01:54.291 --> 01:56.416
Yuck!
What a pigsty!

01:56.416 --> 01:58.208
This will never do.

01:58.208 --> 01:59.749
Hey, that's my stuff!

02:11.957 --> 02:13.582
Let me get that for you.
What?

02:18.374 --> 02:20.124
Why would you do that?

02:20.707 --> 02:22.249
I'm coming, minnie!

02:31.249 --> 02:32.457
Minnie. Jump!

02:32.457 --> 02:34.166
Hi, Mickey, I'm almost done.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.291
Here, take her.
She's nuts.

02:39.208 --> 02:40.416
But I'm not finished.

02:42.124 --> 02:43.249
Minnie, come on!

02:43.249 --> 02:44.582
I'm not done yet!

02:46.874 --> 02:48.374
Huh? Wha...

02:57.457 --> 02:58.582
What... ha!

03:16.083 --> 03:18.457
Thank you.

03:18.457 --> 03:20.582
See? I told you
he was a biker.

03:21.041 --> 03:22.957
Ready to ride?
Meep meep!
