00:02.160 --> 00:03.924
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.080 --> 00:06.447
- Damon, don't leave me!
- In order for me to save myself...

00:06.600 --> 00:10.446
I had to shut off my humanity, damn it.
No regret. We're even, Enzo.

00:10.600 --> 00:15.003
Do you know the reason we're together?
Klaus granted us permission to be together.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.091
You promise to walk away and never come back,
then yes, I will be honest with you...

00:19.240 --> 00:22.528
- ...about what I want.
- I will walk away and I will never come back.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.170
A vampire killed my parents.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.243
- Maybe that was you.
- That was all me.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.570
I'm bad, Elena. I am bad for you.
And I'm choosing to let you go.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.688
When I get Elena back,
remember you're the one...

00:32.880 --> 00:35.770
pep-talked me out of doing the
right thing for all mankind.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.891
You are a Traveler. You have the ability
to keep living inside someone else's body.

00:40.080 --> 00:42.606
We need to find one to teach you
the Passenger Spell.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.642
- Talk to me. Did it work?
- Of course it worked.

00:49.800 --> 00:52.724
I'm Katherine Pierce. I survive.

00:57.720 --> 01:00.883
- Guess who?
- Hmm, I wonder.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.845
- Elena Gilbert?
- Yep.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.444
You're in a good mood.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.843
Well, it's a good day. We're alive.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.651
Yes, we are. And we are partying tonight.

01:14.840 --> 01:15.921
Yes, we are.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.004
- What'd you wanna talk about?
- Are you still drinking vervain?

01:19.160 --> 01:23.370
No, I wear this bracelet.
In case anyone needs my blood, remember?

01:24.600 --> 01:27.126
This is gonna hurt me
more than it hurts you.

01:29.680 --> 01:31.808
- Phew.
- What are you doing? I need that.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.004
Long story short, I'm Katherine. Not Elena.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.450
Katherine is dead.

01:37.600 --> 01:38.647
Not exactly.

01:38.800 --> 01:42.964
While you guys were playing drinking games,
toasting to what a horrible person I am...

01:43.200 --> 01:46.807
I was plotting a way to passenger myself
into Elena's cute little head.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.527
Oh, my God.

01:48.720 --> 01:51.200
I need a crash course
on all things Elena Gilbert.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.203
She's in college now, all grown up.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.490
And I figured, who knows her better
than her compellable best friend.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.368
So, what do you think? How's my dress?

02:01.520 --> 02:04.808
It screams safe and predictable, am I right?
Or am I right?

02:04.960 --> 02:06.166
I'm not doing this.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.202
- Just compel him already.
- Take the fun right out of it, why don't you?

02:13.240 --> 02:15.129
Play along with my secret, Matty-pants.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.448
Would Elena wear this outfit to a party?

02:22.400 --> 02:24.323
No to the dress. Yes to the shoes.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.842
Now let's talk honestly about
the red thing that's happening in my hair.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.805
So you're dead and what,
hitching a ride in her brain?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.321
For now. Until I make it permanent.

02:33.480 --> 02:35.926
- Permanent, how?
- Hello. The hair.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.127
Why did she dye n?

02:37.320 --> 02:40.529
I don't know. She did it in New York
after she shut her humanity off.

02:40.720 --> 02:44.770
But her humanity's back now. Perfect.
It's gone.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.531
Okay, what's Jeremy's birthday?

02:48.720 --> 02:49.881
October 13th.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.168
- When's Elena's birthday?
- June 22nd.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.051
- What's my address?
- 2104 Maple Street.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.725
But you burnt your house down.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.321
I know. That was a trick question.

02:59.560 --> 03:00.800
Good job.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.288
Who do I like better, Bonnie or Caroline?
Please say Caroline.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.811
You love them both, equally.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.286
That's a shocker.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.963
I just have one last question.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.209
It's very important
because I'm going to need it later.

03:14.360 --> 03:18.570
How exactly did Elena Gilbert
break up with you?

03:29.360 --> 03:32.170
Mia said she needs your corpse.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.126
<i>M'! corpse?</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:36.925
Could Travelers be any creepier?

03:37.080 --> 03:41.802
Be nice. Without Mia, you wouldn't be alive
or inside Elena's body right now.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.651
I know. I'd be dead in my corpse.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.690
A corpse that some Traveler
says that they need.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.441
- You see how that's creepy?
- Do you want to be in control of Elena's body?

03:51.640 --> 03:53.768
Look, I get it. Okay?

03:53.960 --> 03:58.170
We have no idea when Elena's consciousness
is gonna pop out.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.804
What are you doing over there?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.286
Get on the bed.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.208
Just in case Elena decides to show up
while I'm out getting your body.

04:07.360 --> 04:09.806
So I'm just gonna be stuck in a hotel room,
bound to a bed...

04:11.320 --> 04:13.527
while Damon Salvatore's
leaving me voice mails?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.481
Remind me again
how this is better than being dead?

04:17.680 --> 04:22.368
Because once Mia does her spell,
Elena will be gone forever.

04:22.520 --> 04:27.811
And this body will be yours for good.

04:34.760 --> 04:35.966
Where you been?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.447
- Just out.
- Define "out."

04:38.600 --> 04:41.120
One who hovers and sticks his nose
in other people's business...

04:41.240 --> 04:43.527
Oh. Sorry. I was defining "annoying."

04:44.240 --> 04:46.004
- Funny.
- Katherine's rotting corpse...

04:46.160 --> 04:48.242
was stinking up the house,
I got rid of it.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.442
- Could be a bit of a problem.
- Why is that?

04:51.640 --> 04:53.802
Because I'm here for Katherine's body.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.049
You're out of luck. You ain't getting it.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.602
My mother asked to be buried
with her family in Bulgaria.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.802
And nothing gives me greater joy
than to deny her dying wish.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.770
Who cares? Katherine's dead.
Just give her the damn body.

05:08.920 --> 05:13.881
Bitch ruined our lives.
Nadia's known her, what, five minutes?

05:14.720 --> 05:17.246
Tell me where she is.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.961
The nicest thing
Katherine Pierce will ever do...

05:21.120 --> 05:23.521
is feeding the maggots
that feast on her flesh.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.408
Give it up,
you're not getting her back.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.805
Have you seen my phone?

05:39.960 --> 05:41.564
<i>TY'</i>

05:45.440 --> 05:47.568
Have you seen my phone?

05:47.720 --> 05:48.881
I'm late for work, dude.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.247
Look at you, Captain Responsible.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.484
Here, join me for breakfast.

06:01.640 --> 06:05.690
No, you know, I'm good.
Seeing it's, uh, 7:42.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.043
Aye, aye, captain.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.761
Okay.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.122
You gonna tell me
what happened in New Orleans?

06:18.600 --> 06:21.763
Well, there were witches.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.604
Gumbo, a few Originals.

06:24.200 --> 06:29.445
Heh. Look, it doesn't matter because it's over.
In the past. No more drama.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.405
I'm starting fresh.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.810
Okay, then. We're celebrating.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.768
I'm throwing you a welcome-back party.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.244
Wait, what?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.360
- No.
- Yeah.

06:44.520 --> 06:47.251
So clean this place up
and invite some people.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.449
And, uh, shower...

06:50.600 --> 06:52.489
because you stink.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.087
It's open.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.727
<i>Hey-</i>

07:19.080 --> 07:22.050
- Are you cleaning the fireplace?
- Yeah.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.209
You know, all those carcinogens. Heh.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.089
I'm stress-cleaning. I'm stressed.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.129
So I'm cleaning. Boy drama.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.328
Not that you care.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.689
I'm here for Elena,
but, uh, clearly she's not here.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.049
<i>- I'll</i> come back later.
- I can give her a message.

07:41.320 --> 07:46.008
Uh, yeah, can you just tell her
that Wes isn't gonna be a problem anymore?

07:46.160 --> 07:49.926
My family's trust came through and I was
able to cut off Augustine's funding.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.929
So no more vampire experiments?

07:53.640 --> 07:54.880
Yeah, it's over.

07:57.040 --> 07:59.088
And can you, just...

07:59.680 --> 08:01.728
tell her that I'm sorry.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.726
I'm really sorry. For everything.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.930
I Will.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.085
Okay.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.688
Aaron Whitmore,
the man I've been looking for.

08:22.840 --> 08:23.921
Enzo.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.766
Hey, I need a favor.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.249
You know how Damon was trying to be
all noble and broke up with Elena?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.363
Of course. There was champagne.

08:34.559 --> 08:37.086
Yeah. Well, I kind of convinced him
he was an idiot.

08:37.280 --> 08:39.726
<i>- You what'?
- Now he's in a bit of a mood...</i>

08:39.880 --> 08:42.770
something tells me he's been
trying to get hold of Elena...

08:42.919 --> 08:44.604
but she hasn't returned
his calls.

08:44.760 --> 08:45.966
Look, I'd love to help...

08:46.120 --> 08:48.441
if I thought he was good for her,
but I don't.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.640
Caroline, how would you like to be judged
solely based on who you're attracted to?

08:53.840 --> 08:56.002
- Come on.
- Why? Do you know something?

08:56.560 --> 08:58.483
Why? Should I know something?

08:59.960 --> 09:02.930
I just mean are you sure
that this is what you really want?

09:03.080 --> 09:06.050
Elena and Damon or Damon and Elena, or...

09:06.200 --> 09:08.726
I know that there's a nickname
in there somewhere.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.084
<i>Listen, I actually think that Elena
is good for Damon.</i>

09:12.320 --> 09:15.369
She makes him happy.
And we all know that when Damon is happy...

09:15.520 --> 09:18.967
He's not out there killing people.
Which I guess is a plus for mankind.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.128
<i>- Exactly.
- But even if I wanted to help...</i>

09:21.320 --> 09:25.325
- ...she's not here. I thought she was with you.
- She said she was staying at Whitmore.

09:26.200 --> 09:29.761
Okay, that's weird. Um...

09:30.320 --> 09:32.607
Well, where the hell is she?

09:38.120 --> 09:40.282
Does that thing ever shut up?

10:13.840 --> 10:15.444
Where am I?

10:20.640 --> 10:22.165
What's going on?

10:27.560 --> 10:28.925
Oh, my God.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.570
Katherine.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.844
Hello, Elena.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.970
You. You put Katherine inside of me
instead of you.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.601
- What happened?
- Elena Gilbert happened.

11:14.760 --> 11:16.569
Wonderful. She's fighting.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.166
Only a matter of time
before she comes out again.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.441
Did you get my body?

11:22.720 --> 11:25.405
Come on. Katherine is exactly
where she's always belonged.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.564
I'm not giving the body back.
Quit giving me the damn pouty face.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.291
I'm not giving you pouty face.
It's my you're-being-a-dick face.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.206
Elena hasn't called back.
It's making you miserable.

11:37.480 --> 11:41.565
Yeah, I'm completely miserable. It's
your fault, telling me to get her back.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.246
You're miserable
because you did what you always do.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.290
You had a problem and instead of
dealing with it, you cut ties and ran.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.522
You're enjoying this a little too much.

11:50.360 --> 11:55.127
Okay, so Bonnie took Jeremy to go visit her
mom and neither of them have talked to Elena.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.044
Who invited you?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.123
- Scram.
- I invited her.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.482
Caroline agreed to help you get Elena back.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.646
You?

12:05.800 --> 12:07.484
You hate me.

12:07.640 --> 12:11.326
You once told me that calling me Satan
was an insult to Satan.

12:12.520 --> 12:16.445
- Well, nobody's perfect.
Mm-hm.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.688
This is what it's come to? You brought
me love advice from Prudy Trudy?

12:21.880 --> 12:24.611
I can be unpredictable
and incredibly reckless.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.205
What's going on here?
Are you guys babysitting me?

12:30.400 --> 12:33.085
- We're just hanging out. Chatting.
- I don't need this.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.691
And I don't need your help.

12:37.240 --> 12:40.528
Well, I guess you better try Elena again.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.402
Seriously, I've never met
a group of needier people.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.490
It's not bad enough
that Damon's trying to win me back.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.166
I'm also getting, "Where are you?"

12:51.440 --> 12:52.566
"I'm worried about you."

12:53.200 --> 12:56.124
"Call me."
"Are you going to Tyler's party?"

12:56.600 --> 12:59.524
It's a wonder that this thing
still has a battery.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.921
- They're getting suspicious.
- Yeah.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.525
We need to find your body.

13:04.640 --> 13:08.690
Stefan texted and asked
if I was going to Tyler's party.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.080
Maybe I do go.

13:10.240 --> 13:14.723
Convince everyone
that Elena is alive and well.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.043
And I casually ask him
where Damon buried me.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.721
No. No way.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.009
You said yourself it's a matter of time
until Elena shows up again.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.369
So then come with me.
Shove her back in if that happens.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.887
This isn't the right place
to be around her friends.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.604
I've impersonated Elena
a million times.

13:33.800 --> 13:36.007
I can mimic everything about her.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.448
This is different.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.361
You're not impersonating Elena.

13:41.560 --> 13:43.005
You are Elena.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.201
When is her birthday?

13:46.160 --> 13:50.210
What grade did her and Caroline meet? Where
did she kiss Stefan for the first time?

13:50.360 --> 13:54.968
Okay. I get your point.
I'm gonna brush up on a few fun facts.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.287
And I know exactly who can help us.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.881
- You used to own my house.
- Yeah, legally. It's not like I paid the bills.

14:04.600 --> 14:08.127
Yeah, but it means you have to invite
certain people in tonight.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.325
People like Elena. Stefan.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.646
That your lame way
of asking if I invited Caroline?

14:15.280 --> 14:16.611
- Pretty much.
- Heh.

14:17.240 --> 14:18.446
Yeah, she's coming.

14:19.440 --> 14:23.650
So when you say you're starting over, you're
basically saying you want Caroline back.

14:25.720 --> 14:28.371
Just get the cups. Okay?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.763
- Elena, hey.
- Hi, Matty.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.929
- Matty?
- Matt.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.326
I mean...

14:41.520 --> 14:45.923
Matt, I was, urn, hoping
that you could help me with something.

14:49.280 --> 14:52.523
- Guess who?
- Hmm, I wonder.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.289
- Enzo.
- Hello, Damon.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.810
Ah. We have business to attend to.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.280
Missed a spot.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.970
Ooh, I love a good fire.

15:25.360 --> 15:29.684
Oh, that's ironic, isn't it? You know,
since you left me to burn alive in one.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.001
Didn't we already do this?

15:31.240 --> 15:34.926
You tried to make me feel guilty.
I saved your life. We're even.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.482
- Heh.
- What's in the bag?

15:37.640 --> 15:38.687
More like "who."

15:38.840 --> 15:42.447
Since you and I last spoke,
I've done a bit of soul searching.

15:42.600 --> 15:45.524
I had a trip to the barber
and did a little research.

15:45.680 --> 15:47.125
Which revealed to me
that you...

15:47.280 --> 15:50.170
killed almost every member
of the Whitmore family since you escaped...

15:50.320 --> 15:53.051
leaving one alive each time
to carry on the family name.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.727
Producing a whole new generation
of victims for you to slaughter.

15:56.880 --> 16:00.726
Exactly as you said you'd do,
back when you and I were cellmates.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.645
Well, you know me.
I like to keep my promises.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.566
And it's occurred to me that perhaps
I wrote you off too quickly.

16:07.720 --> 16:12.567
That in fact, the Damon Salvatore
I remember is alive and well.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.569
I have a present for him.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.369
You brought me Aaron Whitmore.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.565
- Alive.
- He's the last of the Whitmore clan.

16:31.320 --> 16:35.769
Do you remember this vervain wrist watch?
Dr. Whitmore never took it off.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.810
Even when he was rooting around
in our chest cavities.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.845
It's fitting
Aaron should die wearing it too.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.010
So do you wanna kill him? Or shall I?

16:52.400 --> 16:53.606
Come find me later.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.524
<i>Sometimes I like to go uptown</i>

17:00.680 --> 17:02.523
You've gotta be kidding me.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.608
<i>Where flashy people ﬂash around</i>

17:06.359 --> 17:09.409
<i>It's extortionate and I don't</i> care

17:09.960 --> 17:11.371
Matt.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.604
<i>You can taste the pretense in the air</i>

17:14.800 --> 17:17.087
Elena, hey. Come in.

17:17.440 --> 17:18.964
Thank you.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.445
- That wasn't awkward at all.
- Right. Sorry about that.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.800
It's okay.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.962
Go find some blond to hit on.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.841
- I'm gonna make the rounds. Need anything?
- I'm good. Thanks.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.683
<i>Your body is a weapon</i>

17:39.560 --> 17:42.723
<i>And it makes me wanna cry</i>

17:44.200 --> 17:46.965
<i>My body is a temple of doom</i>

17:47.120 --> 17:48.565
- Hey.
- Elena.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.967
- You're alive.
- Of course I'm alive.

17:53.160 --> 17:57.131
Wow, Stefan Salvatore is drinking beer
out of a cup.

17:57.480 --> 17:59.847
Want me to show you
where Tyler keeps the bourbon?

18:00.800 --> 18:02.928
No, I'm trying to stay off the hard stuff.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.811
Hey, so where have you been?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.930
Caroline was about to send out
a search party for you.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.650
Around.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.609
Thinking. Processing.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.771
Trying to figure out
how to deal with this whole Damon thing.

18:16.920 --> 18:21.209
Mm. You know he made a mistake, right?
He wants you back.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.686
Yeah, I know.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.161
Hang on, isn't this a little weird for you?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.521
It's incredibly weird.

18:29.680 --> 18:34.163
But, uh, I know my brother, and I know he's
a better person with you than without you.

18:36.440 --> 18:37.487
So how are you?

18:37.680 --> 18:43.130
How are you dealing with the whole
"Katherine dying" thing?

18:44.040 --> 18:45.041
I'm okay.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.007
Stefan, you don't have
to hide your feelings.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.568
No, honestly, I'm okay.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.722
You know, we, uh, had a thing, it ended...

18:52.880 --> 18:53.881
and she died.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.201
And I'm fine.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.246
You knew her for, like, 150 years.

19:01.160 --> 19:05.085
You're not even a little heartbroken?
I mean, even I feel a little bad.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.883
Maybe we should give her, like, a funeral.
Or something.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.650
A funeral?

19:11.960 --> 19:13.530
Where is she buried?

19:13.680 --> 19:16.047
I should at least drop off flowers
or something.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.208
I have no idea.
Damon said he put her...

19:18.360 --> 19:20.488
where she was always meant to be.

19:23.720 --> 19:25.210
Classic Damon.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.762
Ah, much as I've enjoyed
your quality bourbon...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.924
I feel confident our next drink
will taste better...

19:31.080 --> 19:34.448
with the sound of young Aaron's
dying screams ringing in our ears.

19:34.600 --> 19:38.764
And the knowledge your final act of revenge
will bring us closure and a new beginning.

19:38.920 --> 19:39.967
I'm just curious.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.920
Do you ask all your friends to prove their
loyalty by killing someone over drinks?

19:44.080 --> 19:46.845
His grandfather slit our eyes open
with a scalpel.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.929
You've taken out everyone else in the
Whitmore family, I thought you'd want this.

19:51.120 --> 19:54.249
- Will you believe he's a friend of a friend?
- No.

19:54.400 --> 19:57.244
Because that would force me to believe
that you've gone soft.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.086
When we both know that your very first
impulse when I presented him to you...

20:01.240 --> 20:02.571
was to rip out his throat.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.246
Show me my old friend's still in there
someplace.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.080
End this. For both of us.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.442
Really bad timing, blondie,
I'm dealing with a blast from the past.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.968
Then deal with it quickly and get your ass
over to Tyler's. Elena's here.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.321
- Hmm.
- Unh.

20:29.480 --> 20:30.970
Looks like he's coming around.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.245
It's time to make a decision.
You wanna kill him or shall I?

20:41.320 --> 20:43.288
I hate deadlines.

20:44.320 --> 20:47.164
- I didn't see that one coming.
- I can't kill you.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.846
- Long story.
- Because Elena would hate you for it.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.923
That's why you can't kill me.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.682
Go back to college.
Pack up your entire life.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.844
There's one highway out of town.
Take it north till you hit ice.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.361
Don't ever come back.

21:22.120 --> 21:24.566
How domestic of you.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.727
Apparently Elena would
do this sort of stuff.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.042
I'm actually starting
to feel sorry for her.

21:31.200 --> 21:34.044
- Did you find out where your body is or not?
- Stefan said...

21:34.200 --> 21:37.727
Damon put me somewhere
I was always meant to be.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.689
- A riddle?
- For 145 years...

21:39.840 --> 21:43.401
Damon thought I was in a tomb
underneath the old church.

21:43.560 --> 21:46.325
And boy, was he disappointed
when I wasn't there.

21:46.480 --> 21:49.404
- Well, let's hope you are this time.
- Yeah, right.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.889
Now say your goodbyes.
We can't have anyone following us.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.244
There you are. I've been
calling and texting.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.084
Sorry, my phone died.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.322
Um, what did you wanna talk about?

22:04.480 --> 22:06.767
- I did a bad thing.
- I'm sure it wasn't that bad.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.526
You don't even know what it is.
Elena, stop.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.610
This is really important.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.042
Okay, I'm sorry.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.645
Tell me. What happened?

22:20.320 --> 22:22.846
What would you say if I told you...

22:23.000 --> 22:27.562
that when a certain awful person was
in town, I ran into him in the woods...

22:27.720 --> 22:29.848
and sort of kissed him.

22:30.000 --> 22:34.289
He was there. He obviously wanted to kiss me.
So I thought, "Oh, we'll just make out."

22:34.440 --> 22:39.048
But then it felt really good to kiss him...

22:39.200 --> 22:42.647
so then I kind of
totally had sex with him.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.441
But I swear I didn't plan to do it,
and now I feel terrible.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.769
And the person we're talking about is...

22:51.360 --> 22:52.407
Klaus.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.089
Oh, wow, uh, that...

22:55.240 --> 22:56.287
That...

22:56.440 --> 22:58.966
- Wow, really?
- Would I make something like this up?

22:59.800 --> 23:05.091
And that is why I need you to tell me
what an awful person I am.

23:06.800 --> 23:10.725
Actually, you're one of the
least awful people I know.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.322
So tell me.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.211
How was it? Heh.
You know, compared to Tyler.

23:24.000 --> 23:27.447
- Elena Gilbert.
- Caroline Forbes. Come on.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.602
- Spill the beans.
- I am...

23:29.800 --> 23:32.929
<i>Now that you slept with Klaus,
I mean, how was it?</i>

23:33.080 --> 23:35.082
I am so not answering that.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.480
Oh, you so are.

23:37.840 --> 23:38.921
Oh, my God.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.090
Took you long enough.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.323
I was pretending to care.

24:16.760 --> 24:18.922
It was very time consuming.

24:21.600 --> 24:23.443
Let's get it over with.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.690
In order to seal Katherine's spirit inside
Elena's body, I need some of your blood.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.971
And then...

24:42.720 --> 24:45.405
You mutilate my body. Lovely.

24:46.280 --> 24:49.090
Travelers don't have access
to traditional magic...

24:49.280 --> 24:50.645
so we improvise.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.963
Now shut up. I have to concentrate.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.970
So, um, what's happening now?

25:42.160 --> 25:45.960
Katherine, if you wanna say goodbye
to Elena forever, I need silence.

25:48.240 --> 25:49.287
Are you okay?

25:50.480 --> 25:53.450
Save your daughterly concern. I'm fine.

26:11.720 --> 26:14.485
- Get out.
- Just let me explain.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.483
No, let me.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.849
Klaus killed thousands of people.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.730
Elena's aunt.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.291
An entire pack of hybrids.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.363
My friends.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.645
Caroline...

26:30.960 --> 26:32.371
he killed my mom!

26:36.880 --> 26:38.166
I know. I know.

26:38.360 --> 26:41.330
- I'm so sorry.
- Just stop!

26:42.400 --> 26:45.290
I walked out last time. Now it's your turn.

26:46.840 --> 26:47.887
Go.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.131
No.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.882
Don't take another step, Caroline.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.003
- If you would just...
- I said leave!

27:02.080 --> 27:04.048
- You're drunk.
- Get your hands off me.

27:04.240 --> 27:07.084
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh, you don't know?

27:09.040 --> 27:10.849
She screwed Klaus.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.926
Exactly.

27:35.200 --> 27:36.964
You know, drunk or not...

27:37.120 --> 27:39.566
she doesn't deserve that.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.642
You never told me where you wanted to go.

27:50.480 --> 27:51.970
Where I wanted to go?

27:52.200 --> 27:53.565
Once we complete the spell.

27:54.720 --> 27:56.768
Where should we start our world tour?

27:57.880 --> 28:01.009
Let me finish.
Just a few more seconds and then I'm done.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.724
Elena.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.327
- Unh!
- What was that? I couldn't quite hear you.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.530
<i>I only live in this city
Live in the city</i>

28:25.720 --> 28:28.963
<i>I like to keep the place busy
And I do it for free</i>

28:29.120 --> 28:30.451
Donovan, you in here?

28:30.640 --> 28:33.530
<i>Cause this city can't live without me
Can't live</i>

28:35.280 --> 28:39.968
<i>I only live in this city
Cause this city can't live without me</i>

28:40.440 --> 28:41.487
Mia.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.963
Mia.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.241
Are you okay?

28:50.400 --> 28:52.323
Just finish the spell.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.690
No. No, no. You've gotta be kidding me.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.441
Oh, my God.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.210
No. No.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.361
No.

29:29.520 --> 29:32.330
Katerina, let me introduce
to you Lord Niklaus.

29:32.480 --> 29:33.766
Call me Klaus.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.048
Come on, kiss me, Damon,
or kill me.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.362
Katherine, get out of my head.

29:38.560 --> 29:39.800
I will love you forever.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.884
Forever is a <i>very long time.</i>

29:56.160 --> 29:57.207
No.

29:57.360 --> 29:58.646
I fooled one of you.

29:59.400 --> 30:01.402
No. No.

30:43.240 --> 30:44.685
Damon!

30:49.360 --> 30:50.725
Damon. Thank God.

30:51.440 --> 30:52.680
What's wrong?

30:55.440 --> 30:56.680
It's done.

31:03.560 --> 31:04.607
Okay.

31:05.800 --> 31:07.245
Elena.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.201
<i>Hey-</i>

31:11.680 --> 31:13.444
Say something, please.

31:15.880 --> 31:17.609
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.090
- We need to talk.
- Yeah, I wanna talk too.

31:23.560 --> 31:27.804
The messages on your phone, it's all me, in
case you deleted and didn't listen to them.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.402
I listened to every word.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.644
Then you know how bad I screwed up.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.286
I wussed out, Elena.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.728
I bailed because I was convinced
I'd ruin you.

31:41.960 --> 31:45.282
- That's not what this is about...
- Just hear me out. Just hear me out.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.326
You are literally
the best person I've ever known.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.007
And for me to think that I could change you
gives me way too much credit...

31:52.160 --> 31:54.322
and you, not nearly enough.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.767
You are the best influence on me.

32:04.280 --> 32:05.645
I need you.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.689
You're the good.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.367
And I need a little good in my life.

32:16.320 --> 32:18.129
Because without it...

32:18.840 --> 32:21.446
there's an awful lot of darkness.

32:24.480 --> 32:27.370
- That's a lot of pressure, Damon.
- I know. Elena...

32:27.520 --> 32:30.205
No. No. It's my turn now.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.646
Yeah.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.804
I love that I make you a better person.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.722
I love that I make you happy...

32:41.080 --> 32:43.560
but I don't wanna be
the only thing you live for.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.407
I don't wanna worry about
what's gonna happen...

32:50.560 --> 32:53.530
every time we get into a fight
or if we break up again.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.364
Or who you'll take it out on.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.324
Wait, what are you talking about?

32:59.480 --> 33:02.802
I know what you did to Katherine, Damon.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.249
She was weak and dying.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.289
And you still tortured her.

33:09.480 --> 33:11.881
How is this about Katherine?

33:12.040 --> 33:14.566
It's not. It's about you.

33:15.280 --> 33:16.930
It's about you.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.565
About the person that I can't change.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.009
And the person that you really are.

33:24.880 --> 33:28.009
That person was right to let me go.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.723
I'm sorry, Damon.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.120
But it's over.

33:42.360 --> 33:43.441
We're over.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.086
Damon.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.965
Come on.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.770
Deep down, you gotta be enjoying this
a little bit.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.481
I'm coming!

34:23.000 --> 34:24.364
Hey.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.840
Do you know what I realized tonight?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.002
This is a big-ass house.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.402
I live in a freaking mansion.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.888
My parents are dead.

34:40.159 --> 34:42.049
The girl I love slept with my nemesis.

34:42.199 --> 34:47.001
And I have absolutely no idea
what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life.

34:47.520 --> 34:50.683
Which... Get this.

34:51.000 --> 34:52.842
Lasts forever.

34:56.159 --> 34:57.889
But I got a big-ass house.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.242
Why don't we get out of it for a while?

35:05.680 --> 35:08.843
You know? Just go somewhere.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.281
Be anywhere but here.

35:14.280 --> 35:17.045
Klaus put me through hell
in New Orleans, Matt.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.285
He crushed me.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.086
And just when I thought it was over...

35:22.720 --> 35:24.927
that he couldn't destroy
anything else...

35:25.080 --> 35:27.447
or do anything worse...

35:50.080 --> 35:52.401
So that's it? It worked?

35:52.560 --> 35:54.562
Try not to sound so impressed.

35:54.720 --> 35:58.611
But yes, Katherine Pierce
has permanent control...

35:58.800 --> 36:00.245
of Elena Gilbert's body.

36:01.440 --> 36:03.966
Now, about that payment we discussed?

36:10.760 --> 36:12.728
Ugh. Was that necessary?

36:12.920 --> 36:15.651
No. But she was a loose
end, and I hate that.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.804
Hmm. She gave me the creeps anyway.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.527
Cold. Manipulative. Good hair.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.249
You really are my daughter.

36:27.440 --> 36:31.331
If that's your way of thanking me,
save it for the road.

36:32.720 --> 36:33.846
I'm not going anywhere.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.640
For the first time in the last 500 years...

36:42.840 --> 36:44.126
I'm in the clear.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.443
There's no one coming after me.

36:46.680 --> 36:48.967
Hell, half the people in this town...

36:49.120 --> 36:52.169
would probably slit their own throats
to protect Elena Gilbert.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.121
And what about me?

36:55.320 --> 36:56.970
You're a grown woman.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.810
You can make your own decisions.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.009
But if you want my vote...

37:04.200 --> 37:05.486
stay.

37:07.160 --> 37:11.370
And I'm not saying that I'll ever learn
how to be a good mother, but...

37:11.520 --> 37:12.567
I'll try.

37:14.320 --> 37:17.005
I've got all the time in the world
to get it right.

37:18.280 --> 37:22.205
I've searched for you for centuries.
I'm not leaving now.

37:22.360 --> 37:26.331
But we both know you want more
than just mother-daughter bonding time.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.891
You're right.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.850
I want it all.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.843
I want my daughter.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.365
I want immortality.

37:33.560 --> 37:36.325
And I want Stefan Salvatore.

37:38.720 --> 37:41.007
He's my one true love.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.405
Well...

37:44.360 --> 37:47.045
I'd hate to be the person
standing in your way.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.087
Hey.

37:55.720 --> 37:58.610
Here you are.
Been looking all over for you.

37:58.960 --> 38:02.931
Yeah, well, I couldn't find a rock big
enough to crawl under, heh, so...

38:04.000 --> 38:05.490
Hmm.

38:06.040 --> 38:10.887
You're my friend.
I need you to just give it to me straight.

38:11.880 --> 38:14.042
Am I a horrible person?

38:15.200 --> 38:18.647
Hmm. So that's why you came here, huh?

38:21.040 --> 38:22.451
All right.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.566
Let me ask you something.

38:30.040 --> 38:34.364
When you found out about me and Katherine,
what was your first thought?

38:37.560 --> 38:39.085
Honestly, I thought "ew."

38:39.280 --> 38:42.124
See? And if you held that against me...

38:42.280 --> 38:44.408
you wouldn't be sitting here right now.

38:45.760 --> 38:49.526
Or maybe I came here because I know
that you see the best in people.

38:49.720 --> 38:51.245
Ah.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.882
All right, somebody has to say it,
so here it goes.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.691
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.084
- Caroline...
- Mm-hm.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.241
You are a horrible person. Okay?

39:03.440 --> 39:06.603
You are thoughtless. You're shallow.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.081
- You're completely undependable.
- Ha, ha. Hey.

39:09.280 --> 39:13.842
- Hey, I am vulnerable. Don't be mean.
- You know what? Now that I think about it...

39:14.000 --> 39:16.128
I have no idea what Klaus saw in you.

39:16.280 --> 39:17.920
- What was he thinking?
- Ha, ha. Shut up.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.924
Hey, you all right?

39:40.160 --> 39:41.969
You all right, man?

39:44.640 --> 39:45.641
Never better.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.490
We've been waiting for you.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.368
Damon's teaching me a little game.

39:58.640 --> 40:02.486
See, he assured me you'd be on this road
heading out of town.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.325
- You said that you were gonna let me go.
- I did.

40:05.520 --> 40:06.646
I tried.

40:06.880 --> 40:08.484
Does Elena know that you're here?

40:08.640 --> 40:10.529
She's the reason I'm here.

40:11.080 --> 40:12.844
No, scratch that.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.009
I'm the reason I'm here.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.685
What do you want, Damon?

40:16.840 --> 40:18.683
I want the same thing you want, Aaron.

40:18.880 --> 40:22.566
Go back in time. Fix the past.
Get someone back I lost.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.529
Everyone I lost is because of you.

40:25.560 --> 40:28.564
And you murdered my entire family.
You.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.051
Justifiably.

40:30.200 --> 40:31.611
Either way, I did it.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.730
I tore them apart.
I liked the sounds they made.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.604
Because I realize they deserved it.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.205
Like you.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.564
Elena was too good for you.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.127
I used to think that. Yeah.

40:47.360 --> 40:52.048
That I had to be better to deserve her love
and she had to be worse to accept mine.

40:52.360 --> 40:54.806
I'd lie in the road,
looking up at the stars...

40:55.000 --> 40:57.207
having conversations
with people like you...

40:57.360 --> 41:00.204
trying to convince myself
killing them was a bad instinct.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.887
And that sparing their lives
was the right thing to do.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.884
So, what'd you do? Did you kill them?

41:07.040 --> 41:10.203
Doesn't matter.
The point is I was conflicted.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.886
Right now, in this very, very moment...

41:16.080 --> 41:18.003
I am crystal clear.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.408
Elena thinks I'm a monster.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.887
You know what? She's right.

41:35.960 --> 41:38.531
Now, that's the Damon Salvatore I remember.
