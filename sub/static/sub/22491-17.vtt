00:18.852 --> 00:20.683
It's alive!

00:39.072 --> 00:41.063
Stop it! Mine doesn't work!

00:42.008 --> 00:46.035
Stop! St...!
Sir, mine doesn't work!

00:48.581 --> 00:52.574
Argonauts "A" through "K"
report to Jason.

00:52.619 --> 00:56.020
Argonauts "L" through "Z"
go with Jesus.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.581
Good luck, Jason.
I hope you find the Golden Fleece.

00:58.625 --> 01:00.855
Good luck to you, Jesus.
I hope you find...

01:00.894 --> 01:03.920
a storyline that doesn't end
with you getting crucified.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.460
Argonauts! Turn the other cheek!

01:22.248 --> 01:25.308
The other cheek, Argonauts!
Turn it, now!

01:26.853 --> 01:27.979
Really?

01:32.659 --> 01:34.752
I wish I'd gotten to go on Jason's boat.

01:34.794 --> 01:39.094
You three and Jason,
we are now your sex slaves.

01:39.132 --> 01:41.100
Sounds fair to me.

01:41.134 --> 01:44.433
Come on, Argonauts,
really rub that cream into their sores.

01:44.471 --> 01:47.201
How many lepers
does this colony have?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.843
The meek shall inherit the earth!

01:51.878 --> 01:54.676
Argonauts, get meek, now!

02:01.221 --> 02:04.054
All right.
Treat thy neighbor as thyself.

02:04.090 --> 02:07.685
Steady, Argonauts, steady!
Treat him like thyself, now!

02:09.128 --> 02:10.756
Dad damn it.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.704
Are you Deep Throat?

02:18.738 --> 02:22.230
Oh, no, no, I'm Rim Job.
You want level P2.

02:22.275 --> 02:26.473
New from the makers of My Buddy,
America's favorite best friend.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.016
¤ My stalker, my stalker ¤

02:33.052 --> 02:37.182
¤ His obsession still remains,
even though he's court restrained ¤

02:37.223 --> 02:40.090
¤ My stalker and me ¤

02:43.596 --> 02:46.565
¤ My ex-girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend ¤

02:46.599 --> 02:50.592
¤ Even though I said we're through,
she sticks to me like glue ¤

02:50.637 --> 02:53.037
¤ My ex-girlfriend and me ¤

02:53.072 --> 02:56.303
Look. I don't want to go
to the hockey game with you, OK?

02:56.342 --> 02:58.708
I'm married now. I have a life!

02:58.745 --> 03:02.010
- Honey, is everything all right?
- Margaret, go back inside!

03:02.048 --> 03:06.610
¤ My friend I once experimented with
at summer camp ¤

03:06.653 --> 03:08.746
¤ The one you think
of being night and day ¤

03:08.788 --> 03:10.449
¤ And not the one who made you gay ¤

03:10.490 --> 03:14.790
¤ My friend I once experimented with
at summer camp and me ¤

03:14.827 --> 03:16.385
Is there anything to eat?

03:16.429 --> 03:19.865
Not unless you want a Band-Aid
sandwich with a tall glass of iodine.

03:19.899 --> 03:23.300
- We're going to starve to death!
- Not if I have anything to say about it.

03:23.336 --> 03:24.598
Who the hell are you?

03:24.637 --> 03:27.128
I'm world-renowned actor
Orlando Bloom.

03:27.173 --> 03:30.267
But you may call me
Orlando Bloomin' Onion.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.177
- He smells delicious!
- Try one.

03:34.581 --> 03:35.741
Fantastic!

03:35.782 --> 03:39.183
Orlando Bloomin' Onion,
you win the Academy Award...

03:39.219 --> 03:40.880
for flavor!

03:41.487 --> 03:43.580
Sometimes, nature's miracles...

03:43.623 --> 03:47.252
can be found
in the most amazing places.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.694
The Penguin will rise each morning...

03:55.735 --> 03:57.862
to greet the sun with renewed vigor.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.532
After fortifying himself
for his morning ritual...

04:00.573 --> 04:03.133
he will spread his plumage...

04:03.176 --> 04:06.942
and release yesterday's catch
to begin the day anew.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.949
Renewed, the Penguin will leave
his nest in search of sustenance.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.149
He will make this walk each day...

04:18.190 --> 04:21.591
a route burned into his very soul.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.620
He searches for the only nourishment
he's ever known.

04:24.664 --> 04:27.497
The trek is seven blocks each way...

04:27.533 --> 04:31.594
but when the ice thaws in summer,
it feels like only two.

04:31.638 --> 04:35.540
Soon, he will feel a stirring in his loins.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.634
The Penguin must seek out a female...

04:37.677 --> 04:43.240
and it is in that search
that nature will reveal its greatest miracles.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.649
His tenacity has paid off.

04:45.685 --> 04:49.985
The female has heard his call
and has arrived to lie with him.

04:50.023 --> 04:53.151
The Penguin has chosen
an older, heavier female...

04:53.192 --> 04:56.389
as he often does,
to guarantee a mating.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.997
The Penguin mating ritual
can last for up to two hours...

05:01.034 --> 05:02.331
for two minutes.

05:02.368 --> 05:05.599
Spent, the proud Penguin falls asleep.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.174
Sleep rarely
brings peace to the Penguin.

05:10.209 --> 05:14.578
Callings more important than slumber
make their demands.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.377
The Penguin will stand...

05:16.416 --> 05:21.012
keeping his newborn surprise warm
between his legs for hours.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.784
It's not yet ready
for life on its own.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.224
Something smells like shit!

05:27.260 --> 05:31.390
Who wants ice cream?
OK. All right, calm down, kids.

05:31.431 --> 05:33.865
You just line... Now, kids, you gotta...

05:33.900 --> 05:37.563
OK, look, I can't help you
if you don't quiet down and get in li...

05:39.539 --> 05:43.168
What are you? Don't shake the!
What are you doing?! Oh, my God!

05:43.576 --> 05:47.273
The noble Micronauts,
heroic beings from the Microverse...

05:47.313 --> 05:50.749
scale an earth mountain
in pursuit of glory.

05:50.783 --> 05:54.310
The path is long
and treacherous, however...

05:54.354 --> 05:57.255
Shut up, Pharoid.
It's getting old.

05:57.290 --> 05:58.314
Fatigue sets in...

05:58.358 --> 06:01.589
turning the micronaut called Eddie
into a total ballsack.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.753
Shut it!

06:04.297 --> 06:05.389
Andy!

06:05.431 --> 06:08.059
Oh, God! Andy!

06:08.101 --> 06:11.264
This rope didn't break, it was cut!

06:11.304 --> 06:14.000
This mountain belongs to me.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.769
- It's Acroyear!
- Yeah? I mean...

06:15.808 --> 06:17.799
I thought it was pronounced Acro-year.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.312
You're both wrong! It's actually...

06:21.381 --> 06:23.713
Sons of bitches!

06:23.750 --> 06:27.015
Did you really think
you were any match for?

06:29.088 --> 06:32.387
I'll just use my time chamber
to go forward in time.

06:32.425 --> 06:35.121
I'll be the first one to the top.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.994
See you in the future, assholes.

06:39.599 --> 06:43.126
Who's been using
my time chamber as a port-a-john?

06:43.169 --> 06:45.637
Sorry, dude.
Any port in a storm.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.798
Why, you!

06:51.444 --> 06:55.244
I did it!
I did it, I'm the king of the world!

06:55.281 --> 06:58.011
King of the world!

06:58.050 --> 07:01.019
- Eddie! Is that you?
- Dave?

07:01.053 --> 07:04.147
Sorry, man, I guess
I went up the wrong mountain.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.591
We were doing the south peak
today, the south peak!

07:11.230 --> 07:12.663
Damn Micronauts!

07:13.800 --> 07:16.200
Every night with this!

07:16.569 --> 07:17.831
This is the life.

07:17.870 --> 07:20.566
This life sucks, Phil.
It smells like cow chips...

07:20.606 --> 07:23.439
and them damn Indians
is always trying to kill us.

07:24.343 --> 07:26.243
But we're cowboys, buddy!

07:26.279 --> 07:29.305
Who cares? We can be
whatever the hell we want to be.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.578
Let's check out
some of the other play sets.

07:32.618 --> 07:36.645
- It's magnificent!
- For $179 it better be.

07:37.690 --> 07:39.123
The queen's a whore!

07:42.395 --> 07:44.420
Get off of my damn lawn!

07:52.004 --> 07:55.303
A play set where you can pretend
to wait around the airport.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.970
Damn it! Our flight's been delayed
due to an engine problem.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.980
No, wait.
Now it's a pilot strike.

08:02.014 --> 08:04.676
OK, now our airline's gone bankrupt.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.752
The Playmobil mansion!

08:10.790 --> 08:12.280
Let's be cool, let's be cool.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.759
Welcome
to the Playmobil mansion, boys.

08:14.794 --> 08:17.592
A real, live, Playmobil bunny.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.097
Am I allowed to touch you?

08:20.299 --> 08:21.926
No.

08:21.968 --> 08:24.436
Excuse me, miss.
Which way to the grotto?

08:25.371 --> 08:26.963
Well, hey, everybody!

08:27.940 --> 08:30.272
More guys. Great.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.971
Could someone at least
pretend to be a girl?

08:38.217 --> 08:40.184
Holy smoke!
Hugh Hefner!

08:40.219 --> 08:43.655
- It's such an honor to meet you.
- I'm glad you boys could make it.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.988
- And do these lovely ladies have names?
- I'm Hef's girlfriend, Holly.

08:47.026 --> 08:50.086
- I'm Hef's girlfriend, Bridget.
- I'm Hef's girlfriend, Kendra!

08:50.129 --> 08:52.188
Three girlfriends? How's that work?

08:52.231 --> 08:55.132
Very, very well.
Ladies? The flow chart.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.260
I get Hef to myself Mondays
and Thursdays.

08:57.303 --> 08:59.999
Alternating Wednesdays
are group Jell-O wrestling!

09:00.039 --> 09:02.564
Sunday afternoons
are when we do our quilting bee.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.906
- Not a big fan of the quilting bee.
- Hef!

09:04.944 --> 09:08.710
Make yourselves at home. Playmate
performance of Macbeth in ten minutes.

09:08.748 --> 09:10.739
Forsooth! Forsooth, forsooth.

09:10.783 --> 09:14.549
- I love that man.
- Now this is the life.

09:18.157 --> 09:20.591
Turn a blind e...
I can do this all d...

09:20.626 --> 09:22.992
Could you just give me
a second before you...

09:23.029 --> 09:25.259
OK, look,
Gilmore Girls starts in about an...

09:25.298 --> 09:27.323
OK, look, could you seriously stop that?

09:27.366 --> 09:30.893
OK, I'm getting a little pissed off right now.
Do you know who my dad is?

09:31.337 --> 09:32.736
Merry Christmas, everyone!

09:32.772 --> 09:36.071
As is our tradition,
NORAD is tracking Santa Claus' journey...

09:36.108 --> 09:38.576
down the North Atlantic
towards New England...

09:38.611 --> 09:41.774
on his yearly rounds to give presents
to all the boys and girls.

09:41.814 --> 09:46.012
He hasn't responded to our request
for a cargo list and passenger manifest...

09:46.052 --> 09:50.455
so, as per current security regs,
we're ordering him to divert to Canada.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.718
Ho, ho, ho, boys!
Merry Christmas!

09:58.664 --> 10:02.600
Yes, presents down the chimneys,
that's what I'm doing.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.631
Target 2-Niner degrees and 3-0.

10:08.207 --> 10:10.835
Captain Miller's a bad boy!

10:13.946 --> 10:18.042
Sorry, Charlie,
I'll make it up to you next year.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.743
Fuck!

10:26.025 --> 10:28.994
Mission accomplished, gentlemen.
The system works.
