WEBVTT

00:08.709 --> 00:09.541
- Uh, let's see.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.843
Well, a little about us.

00:10.845 --> 00:14.613
Okay, well, uh, my dad
died about a year ago.

00:14.615 --> 00:18.150
And my husband Duane and our
youngest daughter Melanie

00:18.152 --> 00:20.452
moved in with my
mom to help her out.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.920
- I don't need any help.

00:21.922 --> 00:22.821
I can take care of myself.
- Mom, the doctor said you do.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.123
- Doctors, what do they know?

00:24.125 --> 00:25.324
Nothing.
- What do they know?

00:25.326 --> 00:26.558
Oh, you can't even drive.
- Oh!

00:26.560 --> 00:27.793
You never should have
taken away my car keys.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.261
- What, Mom, you are
a danger on the road.

00:29.263 --> 00:30.729
- I am stuck here

00:30.731 --> 00:31.864
like a parakeet in a cage.
- She's a danger on the road.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.466
A parakeet?
- Just stop talking.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.803
Just, just stop.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.271
- I can't
hear you, Aunt Marion.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.506
Can you speak up?

00:41.976 --> 00:44.309
Yeah, I'm sorry to hear
you're not feeling very well.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.344
- Ah.
- Uh-huh.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.746
- Ah, 60 days sober, baby.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.615
Uh, uh.
- Mm-hmm.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.816
- Oh, cake?

00:50.818 --> 00:52.051
That's how you
doin' me right now?

00:52.053 --> 00:52.918
- Yeah, baby.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.086
- Oh, shit.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.054
I love you, girl.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.789
- I'm so proud of you, Duane.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.023
- Oh, what.
- Ellyn?

00:58.025 --> 00:59.324
Is that, is that--
- Yeah, yeah.

00:59.326 --> 01:00.793
I'm still here, Aunt Marion.

01:00.795 --> 01:01.693
- Ellyn, are
you still even listening?

01:01.695 --> 01:02.661
- Yeah.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.637
Ma, Ma.

01:11.639 --> 01:12.805
Aunt Marion is on the phone.

01:12.807 --> 01:13.872
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.641
Here, talk to her.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.675
Talk.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.414
- Hello, Marion.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.716
How are you, sweetheart?
- Miserable.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.018
I miss my brother.
- Yes.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.252
- My husband is dead.
- Yes, I know.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.587
- How do
you think I am?

01:28.589 --> 01:30.155
- I miss him, too.
- You don't even give a damn.

01:30.157 --> 01:32.324
- Aunt Marion is my
dad's older sister.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.725
- She was always a little weird.

01:33.727 --> 01:34.993
- She still calls once
in a while to say hi.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.228
- She was the black
sheep of the family.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.329
- We're never really
that close to her.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.163
- Yeah.

01:38.165 --> 01:39.431
- She never drove.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.800
Moved to Ohio,
didn't have any kids.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.001
- Couldn't have kids.
- Yeah.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.670
She was a public
school teacher, yeah.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.138
- Substitute teacher.

01:46.140 --> 01:49.308
- I can't imagine her
teaching anything.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.676
- Uncle Don lived in Ohio,

01:50.678 --> 01:51.643
so she went to school there.
- Uncle Don died

01:51.645 --> 01:52.678
like 20 years ago.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.184
- My husband is dead.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.686
- He was cremated.

02:00.688 --> 02:02.688
They sprinkled his ashes
on his mother's grave, hmm.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.891
- Yeah, we never really had a
service for him or anything.

02:41.095 --> 02:42.828
We actually never went to Ohio.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.062
Not that I wanted to go to Ohio.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.631
- Oh, me and your dad,
we went there once.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.665
We stayed in the guestroom.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.500
It was so depressing.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.617
- Hello.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.620
Yup, this is Ellyn.

03:20.935 --> 03:23.468
Ma, Aunt Marion died.

03:23.470 --> 03:24.870
- Aw.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.940
Who's on the phone?
- Her friend Gail.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.441
- Why is she calling you?

03:29.443 --> 03:31.543
- I'm getting Aunt
Marion's ashes sent to me.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.011
- You're
her next to kin.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.479
That's what they do.
- I know.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.948
- Doesn't matter
if you want 'em or not.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.382
- I don't want 'em, though.
- You got to take them.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.251
- I don't want her ashes.
- You're her blood.

03:40.354 --> 03:41.887
- We used to laugh
at Aunt Marion.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.724
I'm not saying it was right,
but she made it hard not to.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.893
For example, when I
was in the 10th grade,

03:47.895 --> 03:49.761
I had a hernia operation.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.767
I called her in and asked her
to turn the TV to Channel Two.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.103
She walked in and
turned the channel,

04:01.141 --> 04:02.174
and then she walked out.

04:02.176 --> 04:03.909
I called her back in and said,

04:03.911 --> 04:07.312
- Aunt Marion, can you
turn the TV on?

04:07.314 --> 04:08.513
- It was off.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.715
- I mean, she would
just change the channel.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.250
- It's so funny.
- And who does that?

04:11.252 --> 04:12.384
- Remember when she
used to pat us on the head

04:12.386 --> 04:13.385
like a dog?
- Ugh, I hated that.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.621
- It drove me crazy.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.529
Maybe I drove her a
little crazy, too.

04:38.679 --> 04:39.645
- Hello?

05:02.436 --> 05:03.468
Hello?

05:52.519 --> 05:53.952
- That was Gate Night.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.788
Oh, how Aunt Marion
hated Gate Night.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.990
- Around here, Gate Night is
the night before Halloween

05:58.992 --> 06:00.892
when evil tricks
are to be played.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.661
- Mm-hmm, she used to
say that Gate Night

06:02.663 --> 06:04.496
was gonna to be
the death of her.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.365
- I don't really
remember her that much.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.166
I was a kid when she
stopped visiting.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.835
- I don't remember her at all.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.737
But, you know, I
think it's really mean

06:11.739 --> 06:13.205
that you guys used
to laugh at her.

06:13.207 --> 06:14.373
- No, she didn't even care
- She didn't know.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.474
- if we were doing it.
- We were kids.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.408
We didn't know any better.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.676
- Yeah, maybe never said it.

06:17.678 --> 06:20.178
- No, it's not like
she didn't scare us.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.382
- Aunt Marion?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.561
- Huh?
- She's doing it again.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.664
- Oh, so?

07:12.666 --> 07:15.100
- She's in
my room, please.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.839
See, I told you.

07:22.876 --> 07:27.345
- Aunt Marion?

07:27.347 --> 07:30.348
- It was hurting me.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.557
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:40.527 --> 07:43.862
- I can't believe she died on
that weird night that she said

07:43.864 --> 07:45.497
would be the death of her.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.632
- Gate Night, and
it's totally weird.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.667
- Yeah.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.437
I've never seen
anybody's ashes before.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.738
- Oh, yeah, me neither.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.373
Let's look at this.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.646
Ugh, oh.
- Oh, god.

08:01.648 --> 08:06.518
- Looks like cement or rocks
or you know that candy?

08:07.254 --> 08:08.386
- Really, candy?
- Yeah.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.554
More than ashes.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.390
- They're creeping me out.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.396
Where are you gonna keep her?

08:18.398 --> 08:20.765
- Pfft, I don't know.

08:21.602 --> 08:22.934
I don't wanna see it.

08:22.936 --> 08:23.869
- Mom, she's not an it.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.403
She's your aunt.

08:25.405 --> 08:29.207
- Fine, fine, I will find
a place for her somewhere.

08:29.209 --> 08:30.709
- Where?

08:41.788 --> 08:42.821
Ma!

08:47.461 --> 08:49.828
You cannot keep her
in the linen closet.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.062
- Why not?

08:51.064 --> 08:52.230
- She's
near our sheets.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.431
- So?

08:53.433 --> 08:54.933
- Can you please
find somewhere else?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.503
- Fine, just leave it
on the dresser for now.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.438
- She's not an it.

09:00.440 --> 09:01.740
Oh, my god.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.341
What is wrong with you?

09:05.779 --> 09:06.811
- Damn it.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.219
- Hey, baby, have you seen my,

09:14.221 --> 09:15.687
what are you doing with that?

09:15.689 --> 09:16.888
- We're getting married.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.123
What do you think?

09:18.125 --> 09:19.391
I'm looking for a
place to put it.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.325
- Oh, well, put it
wherever you want.

09:20.327 --> 09:22.127
Just keep it off my man cave.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.728
This is my man cave, you know.

09:23.730 --> 09:24.629
I work in here.

09:24.631 --> 09:25.897
I work out in here.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.799
I give me some me time,
you know what I mean?

09:27.801 --> 09:31.136
And, personally, I have no
problem with Aunt Marion.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.138
I mean, she was a little wack.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.041
And I know she's Bob's sister,
and Bob's my father-in-law,

09:36.043 --> 09:37.275
and I love him,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.712
but I can't work out with
her like right there.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.314
- You
won't even see her.

09:44.217 --> 09:47.385
- But, babe, I told you
this is my man cave.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.387
- Baby, it's our garage.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.122
- But it's all I got.

09:51.858 --> 09:52.924
It's all I got.

10:11.812 --> 10:15.113
- Babe, you're still
thinking about it?

10:16.683 --> 10:18.917
Ashes don't belong
in the closet.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.753
You were right to say something.

10:21.755 --> 10:22.787
- I know.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.989
I know that, I know.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.657
But it's just,

10:25.659 --> 10:27.859
I don't know why it's
bothering me so much.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.963
- 'Cause you thought
you were okay

10:31.965 --> 10:36.434
with your Aunt Marion being
here, and maybe you're not.

10:36.436 --> 10:37.469
That's okay.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.173
- You wanna know what's scary?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.608
- What's scary?

10:43.610 --> 10:44.643
- Oh, you know me.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.411
- Of course, I know you, babe.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.618
So where did your mom
end up putting them?

11:03.430 --> 11:05.497
- Ellyn!

11:42.469 --> 11:43.501
- Daddy?

11:45.939 --> 11:47.605
Daddy?

11:51.812 --> 11:52.844
Daddy?

11:56.149 --> 11:57.182
Daddy?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.052
I don't know what you.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.255
I don't know what you just, oh.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.091
Oh, why, Daddy?

12:06.093 --> 12:07.459
Why?

12:09.796 --> 12:11.396
I don't know.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.597
I don't know.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.832
- Babe,
what are you doing?

12:13.834 --> 12:15.100
- What, she's not
gonna believe me

12:15.102 --> 12:16.634
if I tell her she was
talking in her sleep.

12:16.636 --> 12:17.535
- I don't know.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.503
Daddy?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.038
Daddy?

12:20.040 --> 12:20.872
Daddy?

12:20.874 --> 12:21.706
Daddy?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.374
- Hey, hey, hey.

12:23.376 --> 12:24.209
Wake up!

12:24.211 --> 12:25.110
- Oh, fuck.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.144
Oh, my god.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.545
- You okay?

12:29.783 --> 12:31.883
- I was dreaming about my dad.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.918
You woke me before he told me.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.053
- Well, I thought
you were gonna die

12:35.055 --> 12:36.488
by the way you're breathing.

12:36.490 --> 12:37.589
- What are you talking about?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.991
- Ah, Daddy, ah, ah, ah, ah!

12:39.993 --> 12:40.925
You were like that.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.794
- But, god, I was scared.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.662
- Well, what are
you dreaming about?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.599
- He had a message for me.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.334
I have dreams.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.938
I believe with all my heart
that they're messages.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.609
Loved ones from the other side
trying to tell me something.

12:57.611 --> 12:59.644
I saw my grandfather
a few times.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.181
He wanted to let me know
he was watching over me

13:03.183 --> 13:05.016
and that I would be okay.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.887
I had cancer and I'm
okay.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.955
- Yeah, it was a
rough period when--

13:10.957 --> 13:14.726
- Yeah, and then I saw
my Nanny once, yeah.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.427
That's my grandma.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.329
We called her Nanny.

13:18.331 --> 13:23.401
She told me to look out for
her little girl, my mom,

13:24.204 --> 13:28.339
and I do my best.

13:28.341 --> 13:29.274
- The dream.

13:29.276 --> 13:31.342
- Oh, yeah, the dream, sorry.

13:31.978 --> 13:37.582
My dad said to get rid of the
ashes, and I don't know why

13:37.684 --> 13:41.252
because someone woke me
before he told me why.

13:41.254 --> 13:44.889
- I saved her life, basically.
- Whatever.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.724
My dreams are the truth.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.429
We need to get rid of her.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.797
- How?

13:52.799 --> 13:53.698
- Can we just throw her out?

13:53.700 --> 13:54.199
- No!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.201
- That's the weirdest
thing you've ever said.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.102
- I say we just
call the cemetery

13:58.104 --> 14:01.573
and ask them, can we bury
her ashes with your dad.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.374
I mean, I had a friend of mine
who buried his mom's ashes

14:03.376 --> 14:04.676
with her dad just
to save some money.

14:04.678 --> 14:05.610
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.911
Your father would not like that.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.112
- No, no, no.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.547
You don't know
what Dad would do.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.015
- I know, of course I know.
- No, you don't know.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.483
- It says here that you can
turn her into a diamond.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.118
- Oh, wow, a diamond,
that's something.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.086
- It costs three grand.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.020
- Ugh.
- Yeah, no,

14:16.022 --> 14:17.255
and I wouldn't wear a dead body.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.489
- Shit, and we ain't got
three grand for that.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.825
- Okay, guys, none
of this matters

14:20.827 --> 14:23.695
because that's not what
Aunt Marion wanted.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.964
- Honey, we don't
know what she wanted.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.900
- Mom, she was cremated
and you're her next of kin.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.301
She knew she was
gonna end up with you.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.402
That's what she wanted.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.737
- Yeah, but I had a dream.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.339
- I had a dream.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.607
- Okay, Ma, sure you did.

14:35.609 --> 14:36.774
- What, you're the only
one who can have dreams?

14:36.776 --> 14:38.276
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
- I had a dream.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.410
- Mom, sorry, please tell
me what your dream is about.

14:39.412 --> 14:44.115
- I dreamed about
Marion and she was mad.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.383
- Mad about what?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.185
- I don't
know she didn't say.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.620
- Then how do you
know she was mad?

14:48.622 --> 14:51.356
- Because she looked mad.

14:51.358 --> 14:52.924
I know mad when I see it.
- Oh, Grandma.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.492
Grandma, you're projecting.
- No.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.928
- No, you think she's mad so
you had a dream that she's mad.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.564
- Dream or no dream, I don't
want her ashes in the house.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.065
- Yeah, no, and I don't, either.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.735
So maybe we can find a
place that will hold them

15:03.737 --> 15:05.136
and take care of them.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.038
- That place is here
because she's still family.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.072
You guys know that, right?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.407
- That costs money.

15:09.409 --> 15:10.875
- What costs money?

15:10.877 --> 15:13.278
- Those places where you
store them, they cost money.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.512
- Shit, we ain't doing that.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.114
- Why don't we just bury
them in the backyard?

15:16.116 --> 15:17.949
- No.
- No, Camille.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.150
- Yuck.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.118
- My father said
to get rid of them.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.420
- Mom, it was only a dream.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.688
- Only a dream.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.657
You know, listen,
haven't any of you

15:25.659 --> 15:28.693
had anything happen to you
that you couldn't explain

15:28.695 --> 15:30.795
but you knew it meant something?

15:30.797 --> 15:32.430
- Oh, yeah.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.099
- After Grandpa died,
I was pretty upset

15:35.101 --> 15:37.235
about Nanny having to
be alone without him.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.237
But I'll never forget it.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.406
After Nanny died, I woke up
in the middle of the night

15:41.408 --> 15:42.774
and I saw him standing there.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.008
- Oh.

15:44.010 --> 15:46.577
- In my bedroom, smiling
at me, holding hands.

15:46.579 --> 15:50.581
I mean, it lasted for a
moment and then it faded away.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.317
- Okay, see, so
then you believe.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.251
- No, Ellyn.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.452
I was half awake.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.421
I saw exactly what
I wanted to see.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.089
- Oh, my god.
- What kind of stupid story.

16:05.832 --> 16:06.898
- Guys.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.601
- Look, if they
bother you that much,

16:10.603 --> 16:10.902
I could take her
back to L.A. with me

16:13.073 --> 16:14.472
and dump her ashes in the ocean.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.740
- Uncle Jay, that's not right.

16:15.742 --> 16:18.443
- No, no, no, yeah, Aunt
Marion loved the ocean.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.944
- Well, I love
the foot spa, Mom,

16:19.946 --> 16:22.013
but I don't want you to
dump my ashes in there.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.848
- What about the attic?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.083
- That's a great idea.
- Mm-hmm.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.718
- Yeah.
- It's still in the house.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.553
Hall monitor?

16:30.090 --> 16:33.925
- I mean, it's not very
respectful but it's in the house.

16:33.927 --> 16:35.293
So I suppose it's okay.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.928
- Yeah, I don't know.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.731
- Babe, you'll forget she's
even there in no time.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.332
- Yeah.
- But that's the point.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.336
She's still here and that goes
against what my father said.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.537
- Ellyn, Dad didn't
say anything.

16:46.539 --> 16:48.039
He's dead.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.640
- Ma, I think we should at
least try keeping her here.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.875
- Yeah, she's got
to go somewhere,

16:50.877 --> 16:52.110
and you've gone
through every closet.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.344
- True.
- Oh, yeah.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.779
- Look, just trust
us on this one.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.047
Give it a week.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.882
If anything bad happens,
you get rid of her then.

16:59.452 --> 17:00.685
- So all in favor of the attic?

17:00.687 --> 17:01.719
- Yeah.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.223
- You're gonna regret this.

17:05.224 --> 17:06.290
- Done.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.531
- Be careful putting
her up there.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.365
- Wait.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.532
Wait, what?

17:15.535 --> 17:16.567
Come on, babe.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.301
She's your aunt.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.670
- You raised your hand.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.473
- Hey, you're the man
of the house, right?

17:22.474 --> 17:23.540
- Eh.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.377
- Is there a place
to put it up there?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.813
- Yeah.

17:28.815 --> 17:29.781
I got it right here.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.883
I'm done.
- Yeah, okay.

17:31.885 --> 17:35.887
Baby, maybe tomorrow when
everyone's out of the house,

17:35.889 --> 17:37.655
you can go bury them somewhere.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.991
No, everyone's gonna think
they're still up in the attic.

17:39.993 --> 17:42.960
It's not like they're
gonna wanna see them.

17:42.962 --> 17:46.164
Baby, it's a good,
baby, come on.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.766
Shit.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.695
- It's alive, it's alive.

18:17.697 --> 18:22.767
It's alive.

18:25.105 --> 18:25.937
- Duane.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.105
Duane, Duane!

18:27.107 --> 18:28.239
- What, what?

18:28.241 --> 18:31.242
- Baby, I heard
something in the attic.

18:35.181 --> 18:36.914
- Marion?

18:38.952 --> 18:40.017
Marion.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.689
Oh.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.257
- Grandma?

19:19.259 --> 19:22.593
Oh, my god, Mom, hurry!

19:22.595 --> 19:23.728
- What happened?
- Grandma is having a stroke

19:23.730 --> 19:24.562
or something.
- Oh, my god.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.130
Oh, my god, go get help.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.198
- Momma.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.399
Mom, I'm here.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.635
I'm here, Momma, I'm here.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.471
It's okay, it's okay.

19:54.627 --> 19:59.697
My mom had a stroke after a
nightmare about Aunt Marion.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.734
- Grandma is 86 years old and
she has a lot of health issues

20:03.736 --> 20:04.936
that I'm pressing for--
- You don't think

20:04.938 --> 20:05.870
the timing is just a
little too coincidental?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.171
- Well, no, because, you know,

20:07.173 --> 20:09.373
things can happen when
you least expect them.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.143
And you can't go around placing
meaning on everything, Mom.

20:12.145 --> 20:15.346
- Her box of ashes fell
off the shelf in the attic.

20:15.348 --> 20:16.414
Explain that.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.115
- Maybe it was rats.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.317
It could be rats, you know.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.251
- We don't have no
goddamn rats in, Mel.

20:20.253 --> 20:21.419
- There could be rats now,

20:21.421 --> 20:22.853
- You do not believe
we have rats.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.021
- because rats only
happen until rats, right?

20:24.023 --> 20:25.256
I mean--
- No, we don't have rats, Mel.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.631
Oh, anybody wanna
get out on this?

20:33.633 --> 20:34.932
- Mm, yeah, babe.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.000
Thank you.

20:40.073 --> 20:40.905
What's wrong, Camille?

20:40.907 --> 20:41.973
- Nothing.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.477
- Camille?

20:52.819 --> 20:53.784
- I'm moving in with Ty.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.820
- What?
- What?

20:55.822 --> 20:56.887
- Tonight.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.190
- What?
- Excuse me?

20:59.192 --> 21:00.024
Mel?

21:00.026 --> 21:01.459
Mel!

21:01.461 --> 21:03.527
- Did you know about this?

21:03.529 --> 21:04.595
- I'm pregnant.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.199
- What the hell?

21:08.201 --> 21:09.467
- Eric is unemployed.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.368
- He'll find a job.
- No, no, no.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.836
And you barely get by

21:11.838 --> 21:12.770
working in a strip
club six days a week.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.171
- He'll get a job.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.373
I'm not talking about this.
- He will get a job?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.574
- I am a grown woman.
- It costs money.

21:16.576 --> 21:17.975
- I have a job, I
have my own apartment.

21:19.279 --> 21:21.145
Can you please just
be happy for me?

21:22.048 --> 21:23.547
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

21:24.884 --> 21:25.916
- Sorry, I'm sorry.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.053
Of course I'm happy for you.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.056
- Dad?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.425
You're happy for me, too, right?

21:40.833 --> 21:44.435
- Yeah, yeah, of course
I am happy for you.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.973
And we'll be here to
help, whatever you need.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.008
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.054
- Will you pass the sprout?

22:07.393 --> 22:08.459
Thank you.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.242
So you're really doing this.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.678
- Yeah.

22:32.652 --> 22:37.555
- Honey, don't you think
you're moving a little to fast?

22:37.557 --> 22:40.024
- You married Dad after
knowing him for a month.

22:41.294 --> 22:42.960
- It's about Aunt
Marion, isn't it?

22:42.962 --> 22:43.861
- I don't know.

22:49.635 --> 22:50.701
Maybe.

22:52.205 --> 22:53.771
I mean, I've been
trying really hard

22:53.773 --> 22:56.474
not to freak out about Aunt
Marion because she's family.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.643
You always just tell
us family came first.

23:01.013 --> 23:06.650
But if I'm being honest,
Grandma's stroke scared me.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.453
- Yeah, I know.

23:09.455 --> 23:10.588
See, I know you.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.491
- I mean, I still don't know

23:13.493 --> 23:16.694
if Aunt Marion has anything
to do with this or not,

23:16.696 --> 23:18.562
but it just got
me thinking, like,

23:19.365 --> 23:20.564
it's time I move out on my own.

23:20.566 --> 23:21.999
Like, I can do this.

23:22.001 --> 23:24.034
I can live out on my own.

23:25.505 --> 23:26.737
- You're right.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.272
You're right, I
know you're right.

23:28.274 --> 23:31.041
It's just really hard
letting you kids go.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.283
Your
sister's pregnant.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.584
- I know.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.685
- Why am I the last to know?

23:41.687 --> 23:43.120
- Well, I was at her place.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.256
She was throwing up,
so I figured it out.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.294
- This is mine.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.362
- It was.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.100
- So you're gonna come visit?

23:56.102 --> 23:59.236
- Mom, I'm gonna be
five minutes away.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.604
Stop worrying.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.873
Come here.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.275
- I can't help but worry.

24:05.545 --> 24:06.977
You wanna take your
Aunt Marion with you?

24:06.979 --> 24:09.980
- Not funny.
- Okay, little funny.

24:09.982 --> 24:10.848
I'll help you here.

24:10.850 --> 24:11.715
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.286
I wanna be happy for Melanie,

24:15.288 --> 24:17.555
but I can't let go of my dream.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.026
Something about Melanie
moving out doesn't feel right,

24:23.162 --> 24:25.463
and I know it's
because of the ashes.

24:31.370 --> 24:35.172
- Ma, you have any tomatoes?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.575
I've been craving
them like crazy.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.144
Ma.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.183
Mom, you've been sitting
in front of Aunt Marion

24:46.185 --> 24:47.218
for over an hour.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.555
- I didn't realize
it was that long.

25:00.299 --> 25:02.233
- You really wanna get
rid of her, don't you?

25:02.235 --> 25:04.034
- Yes, yes.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.169
Oh, god.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.404
Am I being crazy about this?

25:08.674 --> 25:10.875
- Look, some weird
stuff has happened

25:10.877 --> 25:14.478
since the ashes arrived
but that does not mean

25:14.480 --> 25:16.280
that those things
wouldn't have happened

25:16.282 --> 25:17.982
if they weren't here.

25:17.984 --> 25:19.717
- Your sister would
still be living here.

25:19.719 --> 25:21.452
- Mel is 23 years old.

25:21.454 --> 25:23.320
It's time she moved out.

25:23.322 --> 25:27.057
It's a good thing she has a
boyfriend even if it's Ty.

25:37.904 --> 25:38.969
- Hey, babe.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.506
Come over here.

25:42.508 --> 25:43.774
Come watch this with me.

25:44.911 --> 25:45.943
- I don't really like
those kind of movies.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.211
They give me nightmares.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.612
- You gotta be kidding me.

25:48.614 --> 25:51.215
It's so fake and it's mad old.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.683
- Well, it doesn't matter.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.552
It freaks me out and I
can't unsee those things.

25:54.554 --> 25:58.222
- Whatever, okay?

26:11.871 --> 26:13.737
You posted about my guns?

26:15.708 --> 26:17.207
- Oh, yeah.

26:17.209 --> 26:21.278
Um, all I said was, new
home, #boyfriendwithguns.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.214
- And that's posting my
business to all your friends,

26:24.216 --> 26:25.115
you know that.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.617
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:26.619 --> 26:27.952
I didn't know it was a secret.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.219
- You didn't
know it was a secret.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.888
I'm sorry you didn't
know it was a secret.

26:30.890 --> 26:32.690
You want me posting about you?
- Why, well, I'm sorry.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.624
- You want me posting
naked pictures of you

26:33.626 --> 26:35.225
in the fucking shower and shit?

26:35.227 --> 26:36.694
- I said I'm sorry.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.295
- Why the fuck do you get off
posting about my business?

26:38.297 --> 26:39.763
- I didn't know
it was a big deal.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.633
- It's nobody's
fucking business.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.702
That's the big deal.

26:45.204 --> 26:46.270
- Okay.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.540
You have licenses
for them, right?

26:52.044 --> 26:53.510
Ty.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.778
- Listen, don't worry
about my fucking business,

26:54.780 --> 26:56.113
bitch, okay?

26:56.115 --> 26:56.947
- Hey,
don't call me that.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.015
Get off me.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.149
Ah.

26:59.151 --> 27:02.119
You fucking, get off me.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.261
- Are you afraid of this?

27:11.263 --> 27:12.463
You afraid of me?

27:12.465 --> 27:13.998
You really think that
I would shoot you?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.402
- Ty, Ty please put it away.

27:18.404 --> 27:20.237
I'll take down the post.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.472
Please stop.

27:21.474 --> 27:22.740
I'm gonna take down
the post, please.

27:33.085 --> 27:34.151
- Fuck!

27:37.657 --> 27:40.791
Hey, if you don't like it, you
can get the fuck out of here.

27:40.793 --> 27:42.860
You can live with
those fucked up ashes.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.732
You hear me?

28:30.342 --> 28:31.709
- You okay, Ma?

28:31.711 --> 28:33.110
What's wrong?

28:33.112 --> 28:34.478
- I'm worried about your sister.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.580
- Babe, she'll be fine.
- I know, honey.

28:36.582 --> 28:37.781
- She's only been
gone for like one day.

28:37.783 --> 28:38.716
- Listen, I know
you think I'm crazy

28:38.718 --> 28:39.917
with all this Aunt Marion stuff.

28:39.919 --> 28:40.851
- Come on, babe.
- But you know what?

28:40.853 --> 28:41.652
I have a bad feeling about this.

28:41.654 --> 28:43.053
- Babe, you gotta stop.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.288
- No.

28:44.290 --> 28:45.089
- You're gonna start
manifesting shit.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.156
- Right.

28:53.933 --> 28:57.634
What, what is it?

28:59.605 --> 29:00.571
- It's Mel.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.889
- Where's my daughter?

29:18.891 --> 29:20.457
Where's my daughter,
motherfucker?

29:20.459 --> 29:21.291
- Dad.
- Where is she?

29:21.293 --> 29:22.126
- Dad he has guns.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.193
He held one in my head.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.431
- You're not the only one
with guns, motherfucker.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.400
The only difference is I
will use one, you got me?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.468
- I got you.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.772
- It's okay.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.306
You okay?

29:36.308 --> 29:37.508
Where are the guns?

29:37.510 --> 29:39.977
- In
the bottom drawer.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.348
- For fuck's sake.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.183
Put this in your bag.

29:56.996 --> 29:57.928
Apologize.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.062
Apologize to my daughter.

30:00.466 --> 30:01.431
- I'm sorry, babe.

30:02.568 --> 30:04.067
Oh, fuck.

30:04.069 --> 30:05.836
- Don't call my daughter
babe, motherfucker.

30:13.179 --> 30:14.578
- Fuck you.

30:20.920 --> 30:21.985
Fuck.

30:24.623 --> 30:25.722
- So I called the cops.

30:25.724 --> 30:27.291
I gave them the guns.

30:27.293 --> 30:30.060
- They went to Ty's
apartment but he was gone.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.229
- Well, he better not ever
show his face around here

30:32.231 --> 30:34.331
ever again, ever.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.768
- I mean, I never
saw him like that.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.903
It was like I didn't
even know him.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.839
Mom, blames Aunt
Marion, of course.

30:41.841 --> 30:46.076
- Well, whatever it was, I
ain't playing no more games.

30:46.078 --> 30:49.513
Anybody wanna take my
daughter out, come near her,

30:49.515 --> 30:51.582
they gotta get the
interview process, man.

30:51.584 --> 30:53.150
I'm background checking the fuck

30:53.152 --> 30:55.519
out any one of you
loose-lip motherfuckers

30:55.521 --> 30:57.254
coming close to my daughter.

30:57.256 --> 31:02.159
This here is shut down,
chastity belt, locked up tight.

31:02.161 --> 31:03.227
- Oh, god.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.663
- So?

31:06.665 --> 31:08.699
- I want them out of the house.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.969
- Look, I know that Ty
ended up being an asshole,

31:11.971 --> 31:13.370
but it feels wrong

31:13.372 --> 31:14.938
to be blaming Aunt
Marion for what happened.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.707
- Are you serious?
- What?

31:16.709 --> 31:18.442
- You don't feel any connection?

31:19.445 --> 31:21.311
Nothing?

31:21.313 --> 31:25.582
All of a sudden Mr.
Perfect is Mr. Creepozoid?

31:25.584 --> 31:28.819
- Maybe a little, but if you
believe in black magic at all,

31:28.821 --> 31:30.420
then maybe we should keep her.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.956
Getting rid of her is gonna
make her mad or something.

31:32.958 --> 31:34.424
- Mad?

31:34.426 --> 31:36.026
We've been keeping her this
long and look what's happening.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.294
- Yeah.

31:37.296 --> 31:39.763
Now, I can take her to
the cemetery tomorrow

31:39.765 --> 31:44.201
and see how much it costs to
bury her with your grandfather.

31:44.203 --> 31:45.602
- But what about Grandma?

31:45.604 --> 31:47.271
She said Grandpa
wouldn't like that.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.373
- Well, when she gets
home from the hospital,

31:49.375 --> 31:51.441
we'll just tell her Aunt
Marion is up in the attic

31:51.443 --> 31:52.376
and that will be that.

31:52.378 --> 31:53.677
- Ma, come on.
- What?

31:53.679 --> 31:57.180
Listen, your grandfather
loved his sister, okay?

31:57.182 --> 31:59.149
Crazy as she was.

31:59.151 --> 32:02.419
And he told me to
get rid of the ashes.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.955
So I know he'd be okay
with this, I know it.

32:04.957 --> 32:08.792
- Well, what if it costs
three grand or five grand?

32:08.794 --> 32:10.627
- Honey, I don't know.

32:12.932 --> 32:16.099
What's the matter, Camille?
- Camille?

32:20.506 --> 32:21.672
- I lost the baby.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.412
- My first was a miscarriage.

32:28.414 --> 32:31.248
- Mom, I know you're
trying to help,

32:31.250 --> 32:32.749
but can I just be sad
- You might not be here

32:32.751 --> 32:33.917
- for just a little while?
- if this one had lived.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.385
- Is that much too ask?
- You don't know.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.020
I mean, let's leave these
things in God's hands.

32:41.160 --> 32:42.459
I cried for days.

32:44.663 --> 32:48.098
And then the next time I was
pregnant, I was so scared.

32:50.202 --> 32:54.371
Every day, I was wondering if
you were okay inside of me.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.677
Of course, back then,
we know it's medical.

33:00.679 --> 33:02.245
- Mom.
- What?

33:02.247 --> 33:04.548
- Can you please just not
blame Aunt Marion's ashes

33:04.550 --> 33:06.016
for this?
- She couldn't have children.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.451
- Not for this.
- She couldn't have children.

33:07.453 --> 33:11.288
That's what I'm saying.
- That doesn't mean anything.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.058
I just really
wanted to be a mom.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.697
- Honey, honey, you will be.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.668
You will be, you'll see.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.570
You're gonna be a great mom.

33:30.709 --> 33:32.175
You're gonna be a great mom.

33:39.585 --> 33:41.952
I'm getting rid of her tomorrow.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.831
Are you sure you girls don't
want come to the cemetery?

33:54.833 --> 33:56.433
- So sure.
- Not happening.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.268
- Hey, but what if they don't
take the ashes from you today?

33:58.270 --> 33:59.369
- Oh, your uncle
wired the money.

33:59.371 --> 34:00.670
They'll do it.

34:00.672 --> 34:01.638
- I have a feeling
I will be the one

34:01.640 --> 34:03.206
burying these damn ashes.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.474
- Honey, you know I haven't
seen my dad's grave yet.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.709
- And you're not
gonna start today.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.244
I know, you said
it like 100 times.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.512
Let's go.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.983
- Aunt Marion, we hope
this makes you happy.

34:12.985 --> 34:14.117
- Great, all right, let's go.

34:14.119 --> 34:15.318
- Oh, shit.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.286
- I didn't do that.
- Why would you do that?

34:16.288 --> 34:17.420
Holy shit.
- Oh, shit.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.655
Oh, shit.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.322
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

34:20.324 --> 34:23.193
No.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.628
This is bad.
- Oh, shit.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.728
- We're sorry.
- Camille, oh, my god.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.830
- We're sorry.
- I can't open my eyes.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.098
- This is so bad.

34:32.004 --> 34:33.270
- Mom?
- Babe?

34:33.272 --> 34:33.402
- Oh, my
god, is she okay?

34:34.005 --> 34:35.505
- Mom?
- Babe.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.275
Hey.

34:38.277 --> 34:40.844
- Mom, are you okay?

34:44.516 --> 34:46.049
- Oh, shit.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.554
- Oh, god.

34:50.556 --> 34:51.822
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.
- Oh, no.

34:51.824 --> 34:53.556
- Oh, what the fuck?

34:55.027 --> 34:57.861
Oh, my, oh!
- Oh, my god, Mom, no.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.497
- Oh, my god, that's disgusting.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.566
Oh, my god.

35:04.603 --> 35:09.673
Ah!

35:11.376 --> 35:12.442
You okay?

35:43.909 --> 35:45.108
- Hi.

35:45.110 --> 35:45.909
- Holy hell.

35:45.911 --> 35:46.743
- I know.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.111
I'm fine, I'm fine.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.579
- Oh, my god, Mom.
- She slipped in the salon.

35:49.581 --> 35:50.714
- In 15 years, I've never
slipped in that salon before.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.915
- Mom, it was a wet spot.

35:51.917 --> 35:52.849
- Babe, in 15 years,
I'm telling you.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.451
- Come on, just cut it out.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.886
- I'm just saying.

35:55.888 --> 35:56.887
- Did she at
least go to the hospital?

35:56.889 --> 35:58.121
Oh, come on.
- Oh, yeah.

35:58.123 --> 35:58.955
Help me, please.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.257
I went to urgent care.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.491
They took x-rays.

36:01.493 --> 36:02.993
They said that's
all they could do.

36:02.995 --> 36:05.629
- Yeah, I made a doctor's
appointment for Monday, so.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.297
- 15 years, not one slip.

36:07.299 --> 36:08.365
- Oh, god.

36:09.234 --> 36:11.668
It was a wet spot, okay?

36:11.670 --> 36:12.836
A wet spot.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.972
- When I was lying
there on the ground,

36:17.876 --> 36:19.776
all I could think
of was Aunt Marion,

36:22.381 --> 36:24.014
and I kept asking myself,

36:26.118 --> 36:27.417
did I deserve this?

36:30.222 --> 36:31.288
You know?

36:33.091 --> 36:35.525
Did I deserve this?

37:03.088 --> 37:04.087
- Hey, Mom.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.155
I wanted to show you this.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.291
Mom.

37:08.293 --> 37:09.726
Mom, are you okay?

37:12.965 --> 37:14.030
Dad.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.198
Dad, Dad, come here.
- What?

37:18.837 --> 37:20.704
Oh, shit.

37:20.706 --> 37:21.771
- See?

37:24.142 --> 37:25.375
- Should we wake her?

37:30.916 --> 37:34.851
- Okay, look, um, being careful
not to wake the sleepwalker,

37:34.853 --> 37:37.187
gently turn him or her in
the direction of their bed

37:37.189 --> 37:40.290
and walk near the person until
he or she gets back into bed.

37:40.292 --> 37:43.026
If returning a sleepwalker
safely back to bed doesn't work,

37:43.028 --> 37:45.128
use a loud noise to
wake up the person.

37:51.503 --> 37:52.669
- Marion.
- Oh, shit.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.439
- Dad, make a loud noise.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.274
- Marion.

37:57.276 --> 37:58.341
- Do it.

38:11.657 --> 38:12.722
- Babe?

38:16.662 --> 38:19.663
- Ma, are you okay?

38:20.966 --> 38:21.965
- I'm fine.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.033
Go to bed.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.270
- Okay.

38:27.272 --> 38:28.872
I think she's good.

38:28.874 --> 38:29.706
Yeah, she's good.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.174
Go to bed.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.636
- I don't remember anything.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.672
Baby, my hair.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.241
I can't believe I did this.

39:06.712 --> 39:07.777
- I don't know.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.113
I kinda like it.

39:11.483 --> 39:12.849
- I kinda like it.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.019
Dick.

39:22.627 --> 39:23.993
- That's our cutting board.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.595
- It's a
spirit board now.

39:25.597 --> 39:27.197
- What
are doing with it?

39:27.199 --> 39:28.698
- I'm gonna talk to
your Aunt Marion,

39:28.700 --> 39:29.899
find out what she wants.

39:29.901 --> 39:31.868
- And you think
that's gonna work?

39:32.704 --> 39:33.670
- It's worth the shot.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.671
You wanna do it with me?

39:34.673 --> 39:35.705
- No.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.808
Mom, I'd be afraid
to mess with that.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.043
- Why?

39:40.045 --> 39:41.611
We'll either hear from
Aunt Marion or we won't.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.382
- Mm, maybe we should hire
a professional medium.

39:46.351 --> 39:47.851
- To charge me an arm and a leg?

39:47.853 --> 39:48.885
No, thank you.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.520
I can do it myself.

39:50.522 --> 39:53.590
Besides, your dad, he doesn't
like strangers in the house

39:53.592 --> 39:54.924
knowing our business.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.128
- Do you even know
how to use it?

40:00.432 --> 40:01.715
- What's to know?

40:01.716 --> 40:02.999
You put your hands on
the planchette, you talk.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.068
I've seen it in the movies.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.704
- First off, this
is an egg slicer.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.640
- Hey, guys.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.742
Hey, babe.
- Hey, babe, hey.

40:12.744 --> 40:13.810
- What's that for?

40:15.180 --> 40:16.413
- What do you think?

40:16.415 --> 40:18.148
- I'm looking at
directions online.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.382
- Oh, good.

40:19.384 --> 40:20.316
- Every
time I come home,

40:20.318 --> 40:21.785
there's something new with this.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.319
- Never insult a spirit.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.288
- Ha-ha, you're screwed.

40:25.290 --> 40:26.489
- Never play alone.

40:26.491 --> 40:28.425
- What else does it say?
- A lot.

40:28.427 --> 40:30.927
It says never use the board
if you are sick, drunk,

40:30.929 --> 40:33.129
depressed, or mentally disabled.

40:33.131 --> 40:34.431
- Eh.
- Not a word.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.433
- Do not force anyone
to use the spirit board

40:36.435 --> 40:37.667
against their will.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.469
- So just to be clear,

40:39.471 --> 40:42.939
do not ask me to do
this with you, huh?

40:42.941 --> 40:44.007
- Okay.

40:47.312 --> 40:48.778
- Never trust the spirit.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.714
Evil spirits will use
lies and false flattery

40:51.716 --> 40:54.451
to gain your confidence
and trick you.

40:54.453 --> 40:56.820
- So how do I know if Aunt
Marion is telling the truth?

40:56.822 --> 40:58.388
- How do you even know
it's Aunt Marion at all?

40:58.390 --> 40:59.322
- I'll find out.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.590
Okay, go ahead.

41:00.592 --> 41:03.026
- Don't ask about God or
when you're gonna die.

41:04.496 --> 41:07.964
If you encounter a spirit
called Zozo, stop playing.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.466
- Who's a Zozo.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.935
- I don't know but if we
encounter him, we'll stop.

41:11.937 --> 41:14.704
- Okay, never let the planchette
fall or fly off the board.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.372
It could allow an
evil spirit to escape.

41:16.374 --> 41:19.542
- Hold on, if this things flies
up the board, we're moving.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.678
Moving.
- Dad, Dad.

41:21.680 --> 41:24.380
When you're finished,
always say goodbye.

41:24.382 --> 41:25.782
I mean, that's pretty much it.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.083
The rest is about
getting rid of the board.

41:27.085 --> 41:27.917
- Save that part.

41:27.919 --> 41:28.952
We'll need that later.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.019
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:32.591 --> 41:33.656
- So?

41:36.228 --> 41:37.293
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.294
- Okay.

41:42.501 --> 41:43.566
Aunt Marion.

41:45.504 --> 41:46.669
- Now what?

41:46.671 --> 41:47.804
- Ask a question, Mom.

41:50.375 --> 41:53.009
- Aunt Marion, are you here?

41:56.281 --> 41:57.714
Aunt Marion, please answer me.

41:57.716 --> 41:58.815
Are you here?

42:07.058 --> 42:08.124
- Oh.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.294
Did one of you just move that?

42:11.296 --> 42:12.662
- No.
- No, I swear.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.231
- Ha-ha?

42:15.233 --> 42:16.799
- She's laughing.

42:16.801 --> 42:19.202
- You don't even
know it's her yet.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.170
- Aunt Marion, this is Melanie.

42:21.973 --> 42:23.039
Is this you?

42:26.111 --> 42:27.844
- One of you had to move that.

42:27.846 --> 42:29.879
- I swear to god.
- Dad, it moved.

42:32.551 --> 42:34.350
- Aunt Marion, this is Duane.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.220
Are you mad at us?

42:40.091 --> 42:42.425
Okay, so, she's not mad.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.930
- Aunt Marion, are
you mad at my mom?

42:50.135 --> 42:51.634
- See, I was right.

42:51.636 --> 42:53.102
I told you guys.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.170
God, ugh.

42:55.440 --> 42:59.342
Aunt Marion, is there
anything I can do

42:59.344 --> 43:00.577
to make you feel better?

43:02.047 --> 43:03.112
Anything.

43:10.989 --> 43:11.521
Oh, shit.

43:11.522 --> 43:12.054
- Babe.

43:12.057 --> 43:13.256
- Oh, my god, Mom.

43:13.258 --> 43:14.357
- Get your hands off.
- I can't, I can't.

43:14.359 --> 43:15.391
- Stop, Mom.
- Get your hands off.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.360
- Oh, my god.

43:17.362 --> 43:18.328
Oh, my god!

43:19.164 --> 43:20.229
Help me!

43:27.739 --> 43:29.572
- Mom, stop, stop!

43:29.574 --> 43:32.775
Stop pulling your nails, fuck!

43:32.777 --> 43:34.978
Mom, no, Mom, no!

43:35.814 --> 43:37.046
Mom, no, stop!

43:45.690 --> 43:46.823
- Oh, my god.

43:47.826 --> 43:49.192
My nails.

43:49.194 --> 43:49.993
Jesus, my nails.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.194
Look at my.

43:51.196 --> 43:52.362
Oh, my god, Duane,
did I do that to you?

43:52.364 --> 43:54.998
- No, no, no, it
was Aunt Marion.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.634
- Marion or not Marion, we
are done with this board.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.602
- Yeah.
- No, we have to say goodbye.

43:59.604 --> 44:00.937
- No, fuck that, no!
- What?

44:00.939 --> 44:02.005
Are you crazy?
- No, we're not doing that.

44:02.007 --> 44:03.773
- We have to.

44:03.775 --> 44:04.907
Don't do this.
- Duane.

44:04.909 --> 44:06.175
Duane, please.

44:06.177 --> 44:07.076
Okay, okay.

44:08.913 --> 44:10.446
- Goodbye, spirit.

44:10.448 --> 44:13.249
- Goodbye and good
riddance whoever you are.

44:13.251 --> 44:14.617
- Goodbye, Aunt Marion.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.371
- Okay, do not burn the board.

44:35.373 --> 44:37.273
There have been cases where
people burned the board

44:37.275 --> 44:39.242
and it released an evil spirit.

44:40.912 --> 44:43.346
- Oh, god, my nails.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.747
- They're nails, babe.

44:44.749 --> 44:45.948
They'll grow back.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.417
- To properly dispose
of a spirit board,

44:47.419 --> 44:50.286
you need to pour holy water
on it and then bury it.

44:50.288 --> 44:51.688
- I will.

44:51.690 --> 44:54.190
I'll go to the church tomorrow
and I'll pick some up.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.359
- Baby, you haven't
been to church in years.

44:56.361 --> 44:58.227
- I never really
had a reason to go.

44:59.831 --> 45:02.198
- Wait.
- God, Duane, I'm so sorry.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.566
- Oh, my god.

45:03.568 --> 45:06.102
Where is the planchette?

45:06.104 --> 45:07.704
- It's in the dining
room on the board, why?

45:07.706 --> 45:09.539
- Do not leave the
planchette on the board

45:09.541 --> 45:10.973
when you're not using it.

45:10.975 --> 45:13.443
This could allow evil
spirits to enter the world.

45:13.445 --> 45:15.011
- Why is it saying
that right now?

45:15.013 --> 45:16.212
- No, no, no, I'm sorry, Ma.

45:17.282 --> 45:18.214
- That's ridiculous.
- Guys.

45:18.216 --> 45:19.148
I can't believe.
- Guys, hey!

45:19.150 --> 45:19.982
- It should be the first thing.

45:19.984 --> 45:20.216
- Hey!
- Not the last.

45:21.219 --> 45:23.786
Before anybody panics,
let's just go check.

45:25.690 --> 45:27.256
Shit.

45:29.627 --> 45:30.693
- Now, what?

45:31.930 --> 45:32.995
- Hang on.

45:35.533 --> 45:36.999
Okay, okay, okay.

45:37.001 --> 45:39.736
It says we can
start a new session

45:39.738 --> 45:40.937
and ask the demon to leave.

45:40.939 --> 45:42.271
- Mm-mm, nope, nope, nope, nope.

45:42.273 --> 45:44.073
We are done with
this board tonight.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.476
It was only on the board
for like 20 minutes.

45:46.478 --> 45:48.745
It's an egg slicer, and
that's the internet,

45:48.747 --> 45:51.814
and it could be complete bullshit
what you're reading, okay?

45:51.816 --> 45:52.949
We're done.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.183
Let's just go to bed.

45:54.185 --> 45:55.184
We'll get rid of
it in the morning.

45:55.186 --> 45:56.385
- Okay, I'm for that.

45:56.387 --> 45:58.154
Okay.
- Yeah.

46:00.325 --> 46:01.524
- Baby, will you
sleep with me tonight?

46:01.526 --> 46:03.359
- Oh, I was planning on it.
- Okay.

46:05.563 --> 46:06.796
- Wait.

46:06.798 --> 46:08.598
Why don't you guys sleep
together every night?

46:08.600 --> 46:09.565
- Well, we do when we wanna--

46:09.567 --> 46:10.399
- No.
- Yeah.

46:10.401 --> 46:11.467
- I'm good.

47:00.752 --> 47:03.186
- Aunt Marion, are you here?

47:06.124 --> 47:09.892
Aunt Marion, please,
I wanna talk to you.

47:09.894 --> 47:10.960
Are you here?

47:19.170 --> 47:21.804
Did you make Ty turn on Melanie?

47:23.274 --> 47:25.341
Did you make Camille
have a miscarriage?

47:32.183 --> 47:35.318
My mom and me
falling at the salon?

47:36.254 --> 47:37.320
Was that you?

47:46.197 --> 47:48.464
Are you mad at us because
we laughed at you?

47:51.336 --> 47:54.637
That was stupid and
thoughtless of us.

47:54.639 --> 47:56.072
We didn't mean to hurt you.

47:58.843 --> 48:00.309
Will you forgive us, please?

48:07.852 --> 48:09.051
Thank you, Aunt Marion.

48:10.088 --> 48:11.153
Thank you.

48:12.624 --> 48:13.923
Are you with my father?

48:19.163 --> 48:22.098
If you see him, can you
tell him that I miss him?

48:28.606 --> 48:29.438
You.

48:29.440 --> 48:30.706
Ha, yeah, me, okay.

48:30.708 --> 48:32.308
Yeah, I've got the board, right.

48:32.310 --> 48:33.276
Okay, I'll do it.

48:34.579 --> 48:38.414
Hey, Aunt Marion, will you
still be watching over us here?

48:53.564 --> 48:54.630
Goodbye.

49:01.806 --> 49:02.872
Daddy?

49:05.176 --> 49:06.242
I tried for 20 minutes
to contact my dad.

49:09.747 --> 49:11.247
Didn't get any answer.

49:11.249 --> 49:13.683
- I can't believe you used
the spirit board alone.

49:13.685 --> 49:15.651
- It's like I
couldn't help myself.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.353
- Do not become addicted.

49:17.355 --> 49:20.056
Evil spirits may try to make
you dependent on the board

49:20.058 --> 49:22.959
in order to gain control of you.

49:22.961 --> 49:24.527
- Hmm.

49:24.529 --> 49:25.962
- We have to get rid of it.

49:27.031 --> 49:29.565
- Okay, remember
to bury the board

49:29.567 --> 49:31.300
and the planchette separately.

49:32.070 --> 49:33.002
- Okay.

49:33.004 --> 49:34.036
What else?

49:35.039 --> 49:36.939
- Sprinkle the ground
above with holy water

49:36.941 --> 49:38.507
and also use some
to cleanse the area

49:38.509 --> 49:39.809
where you used the board.

49:41.946 --> 49:44.046
- Oh, my god.

49:44.048 --> 49:45.214
Is this blood?

49:46.751 --> 49:48.184
- Okay.

49:48.186 --> 49:49.251
Let's do this.

49:50.088 --> 49:51.520
- He buried it.

49:51.522 --> 49:53.656
We did everything
according to ritual.

49:55.059 --> 49:59.328
Aunt Marion forgave us, and
I don't feel afraid anymore.

50:01.232 --> 50:02.865
Oh, and my mom is back.

50:06.504 --> 50:07.570
It's a good day.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.207
It's a really good day.

50:12.310 --> 50:17.179
67 across, danger signal
perhaps, four letters.

50:18.016 --> 50:19.081
- Horseshittin'.

50:19.851 --> 50:21.117
- I said four letters, Ma.

50:21.119 --> 50:22.752
- You didn't say that.

50:22.754 --> 50:23.686
- I did.

50:23.688 --> 50:25.421
You weren't listening to me.

50:25.423 --> 50:27.056
- I'm thirsty.

50:27.058 --> 50:28.958
- Okay, I'm gonna
get you some water.

50:36.401 --> 50:37.466
- Omen.

50:40.171 --> 50:41.437
- Hello.
- Whoa.

50:42.774 --> 50:44.707
- I'm looking for Ellyn.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.208
- Um, I'm Ellyn.

50:47.478 --> 50:50.479
- I'm Gail.

50:50.481 --> 50:53.449
- Gail was my Aunt
Marion's special friend.

50:53.451 --> 50:55.418
- Oh, it's her only friend.

50:56.687 --> 50:57.953
Believe me.

50:57.955 --> 51:00.389
- So, we're not sure
what she's doing here,

51:00.391 --> 51:01.657
but we are gonna make
her feel at home.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.726
- Nobody knows what
she's doing here.

51:03.728 --> 51:04.927
- Yeah.

51:04.929 --> 51:06.195
Make her feel at home, Mom.

51:06.197 --> 51:08.097
- No, you make her feel at home.

51:08.099 --> 51:09.165
I'm home.

51:14.639 --> 51:18.107
- Your bandages, what happened?

51:18.109 --> 51:20.643
- Oh, um, burn them cooking.
- Nail fungus.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.514
- Um, so what brings
you here, Gail?

51:25.516 --> 51:28.851
- I have been in
Ohio my whole life.

51:28.853 --> 51:32.688
Now that Marion's gone, I
thought I would travel a little.

51:32.690 --> 51:35.724
So, I took the
train and here I am.

51:36.561 --> 51:37.526
- Hmm.

51:37.528 --> 51:39.762
Um, in my aunt's obituary,

51:39.764 --> 51:42.164
it said you were her
very special friend.

51:42.166 --> 51:43.065
- Hmm.

51:44.135 --> 51:46.435
After your Uncle Don passed,

51:46.437 --> 51:50.673
Marion went a
little, um, you know.

51:50.675 --> 51:53.976
So I moved in and
took care of her.

51:54.979 --> 51:56.745
- So, where are you staying?

51:56.747 --> 51:58.781
- Oh, I don't know yet.

51:58.783 --> 52:01.417
I was hoping you
could suggest a hotel.

52:01.419 --> 52:02.718
- Oh, no.

52:02.720 --> 52:04.253
No, no, no, no, you
don't need a hotel.

52:04.255 --> 52:07.056
You can stay, you stay
here with us, right, yeah.

52:07.058 --> 52:08.958
- Oh, I couldn't impose.

52:10.027 --> 52:14.663
- Um, give us just one minute.

52:14.665 --> 52:15.731
- Certainly.

52:24.609 --> 52:26.075
- What, what, what, what?

52:26.077 --> 52:27.943
- Why did you
say she could stay here?

52:27.945 --> 52:29.578
- I can't just
send her to a hotel.

52:29.580 --> 52:30.513
- Why not?

52:30.515 --> 52:31.413
That's what she asked for.

52:36.120 --> 52:38.487
- So you just show up?

52:38.489 --> 52:40.256
You can't pick up the phone?

52:42.126 --> 52:43.726
- She was my special friend.

52:43.728 --> 52:45.461
- You mean Aunt
Marion's special friend.

52:45.463 --> 52:46.962
- That's what I said.

52:46.964 --> 52:48.864
- No, you said your special
friend, and that's creepy.

52:48.866 --> 52:50.900
- Special friend makes it
sound like they're lesbians.

52:50.902 --> 52:51.734
- Hey, hey, hey.
- And that's sort of weird.

52:51.736 --> 52:52.668
- No, no, no, no.

52:52.670 --> 52:54.236
Hey, none of this matters

52:54.238 --> 52:56.839
'cause you already asked her
and you can't uninvite her.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.742
- Why don't we just tell her
all we have is a lumpy couch?

52:59.744 --> 53:01.210
- Ah, great idea.

53:01.212 --> 53:02.745
- Oh, baby, you're so smart.
- Do it, do it, do it.

53:02.747 --> 53:05.915
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

53:05.917 --> 53:08.551
- And this is us on
the bus to Columbus.

53:08.553 --> 53:09.818
- Oh.

53:09.820 --> 53:12.321
She used to send us post
cards from Columbus.

53:12.323 --> 53:13.422
She went there a lot.

53:13.424 --> 53:15.858
- We both did together.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.960
They had our favorite bookstore.

53:17.962 --> 53:19.895
- Oh, which one was that?

53:19.897 --> 53:21.764
- It was a black
magic bookstore.

53:23.000 --> 53:25.568
Your Aunt Marion was
fascinated with the afterlife.

53:25.570 --> 53:26.635
- Hmm.

53:29.273 --> 53:31.273
Oh, she's wearing a
neck brace in this one.

53:31.275 --> 53:32.641
- Yes, I know.

53:32.643 --> 53:33.909
Shortly before she died,

53:33.911 --> 53:36.011
she fell out of a
chair, poor thing.

53:36.013 --> 53:37.012
- Oh.

53:37.014 --> 53:39.648
She looks so lifeless.

53:39.650 --> 53:41.083
- Well, she should.

53:41.085 --> 53:42.184
She's dead.

53:42.186 --> 53:43.452
- Oh, my god.

53:43.454 --> 53:44.820
- I know.

53:44.822 --> 53:46.322
I took a picture.

53:46.324 --> 53:47.623
Call me crazy.

53:50.127 --> 53:51.760
Have you ever seen a dead body?

53:53.064 --> 53:55.364
- When we found my dad
dead in his favorite chair,

53:56.701 --> 53:57.766
I took a picture.

53:59.570 --> 54:01.070
Yeah, I texted it to Jay,

54:01.072 --> 54:04.373
but he just thought it
was weird and deleted it.

54:06.010 --> 54:07.009
I still have it.

54:10.414 --> 54:12.214
I won't go to his grave,

54:12.216 --> 54:14.116
but I'll keep a
dead picture of him.

54:16.053 --> 54:17.119
Crazy, right?

54:18.956 --> 54:20.556
She looks--
- Mad.

54:20.558 --> 54:22.758
- Yeah.
- Yes, I know.

54:22.760 --> 54:24.326
Marion had a lot of anger

54:24.328 --> 54:26.829
and it only got
worse with the years.

54:26.831 --> 54:28.764
Towards the end,
she was unbearable.

54:31.402 --> 54:32.434
But I loved her

54:34.939 --> 54:36.538
as I'm sure you did, too.

54:38.409 --> 54:39.475
- Hmm.

55:18.416 --> 55:19.481
- Hello?

56:15.673 --> 56:16.739
Momma.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.339
- She laughed at me.

56:58.649 --> 57:01.617
- Dad, hurry!

57:01.619 --> 57:04.052
- What the?
- Am I funny now?

57:07.525 --> 57:08.590
- Mom!

57:08.592 --> 57:09.458
- What are you doing?
- Mom, no!

57:09.460 --> 57:10.759
- Stop, stop!
- No!

57:11.962 --> 57:13.028
No, stop!

57:16.000 --> 57:17.332
- Ellyn!

57:26.310 --> 57:27.709
- Help me.

57:27.711 --> 57:28.710
Help me.

57:29.513 --> 57:30.579
Help me!

57:34.852 --> 57:35.818
- What?
- The hell was that?

57:35.820 --> 57:37.019
- Gail.
- Gail?

57:37.021 --> 57:38.520
- Gail.
- Gail.

57:38.522 --> 57:40.889
Gail, Gail, Gail, Gail.
- What is she doing?

57:40.891 --> 57:42.090
What is she doing?

57:42.092 --> 57:45.194
What is she doing?

57:45.196 --> 57:46.528
Mom!

57:46.530 --> 57:47.596
Mom!

57:49.834 --> 57:52.134
Gail, Gail!

57:52.136 --> 57:53.268
Duane, break it down.

57:57.141 --> 57:58.373
- Oh, no.

57:58.375 --> 57:59.208
- Oh, my, no!

57:59.210 --> 58:00.843
- Oh, my god, Gail.

58:03.481 --> 58:04.680
What did she do?

58:10.688 --> 58:12.387
Gail came here with a purpose.

58:14.692 --> 58:17.693
And she killed herself trying
to accomplish something.

58:22.032 --> 58:23.098
But what?

58:26.403 --> 58:27.536
God, I wish I knew.

58:30.875 --> 58:32.241
I wish I knew.

58:39.884 --> 58:40.949
Fuck.

58:42.853 --> 58:43.652
- Hey, Mom, you okay?

58:43.654 --> 58:44.853
- No!

58:44.855 --> 58:46.889
No, I'm not okay.

58:46.891 --> 58:48.590
I can't fucking see.

58:48.592 --> 58:51.159
I can't open this goddamn pills.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.196
And look at my hair!

58:54.198 --> 58:55.464
Fucking look at my hair.

58:55.466 --> 58:57.266
- It's okay, it's okay.

58:57.268 --> 58:58.600
- Jesus Christ!

59:05.976 --> 59:07.042
- All right.

59:11.181 --> 59:12.314
See?

59:12.316 --> 59:13.382
Back to normal.

59:14.685 --> 59:16.818
- At least my hair color is.

59:16.820 --> 59:19.555
- Mom, we're gonna
figure this out.

59:19.557 --> 59:21.590
Let me grab a towel,
I'll be right back.

59:21.592 --> 59:22.658
- Okay.

59:40.511 --> 59:41.743
What's happening to me?

59:44.815 --> 59:48.216
I know now that
laughing at Aunt Marion

59:48.218 --> 59:49.918
all those years was wrong.

59:51.989 --> 59:53.789
I'm not proud of my behavior,

59:56.193 --> 59:58.060
but, fuck, I thought
she forgave me.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:02.631
Maybe that wasn't
her, I don't know.

01:00:04.401 --> 01:00:08.971
All I can say is Duane,
thank god for Duane.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:13.041
He's been my rock
through all of this.

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.330
- Ellyn.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:22.778
- What the fuck?

01:01:25.816 --> 01:01:27.549
- Ellyn, it's Duane.

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:30.952
Let me go.
- Mom!

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:34.489
What's happening?

01:01:34.491 --> 01:01:35.557
Dad?

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:37.159
Mom?

01:01:37.161 --> 01:01:38.393
- What?

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:39.061
Oh, my god, Duane.
- Get away from me.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:40.662
Don't touch me.

01:01:40.664 --> 01:01:41.663
- Okay, no.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:48.837
- Look, man, uh,
I can't stay here.

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:50.672
I gotta go.

01:01:51.975 --> 01:01:53.308
Aunt Marion wants me dead.

01:01:54.978 --> 01:01:57.746
If I stay, I'ma die, you know?

01:01:57.748 --> 01:01:59.481
You understand that?

01:01:59.483 --> 01:02:00.315
You see what she did?

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.183
Look at this shit.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.219
I gotta go, man.

01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.153
Don't fucking judge me either.

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:06.588
You don't know what it's like.

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:11.526
I said don't fucking judge me.

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.065
I didn't do this shit.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:20.969
Fuck this, man.

01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:22.504
I gotta go, I'm not doing this.

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:27.609
- Here you go, Grandma.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:31.446
Not the best cook, but
I hope you like it.

01:02:31.448 --> 01:02:33.815
- What can you do to a
grilled cheese sandwich, huh?

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:36.218
- You know, figured
it was a safe bet.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.385
- Mm.

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:39.287
Are you all moved in?

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:40.922
- Uh, yeah.

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:43.425
- Well, it's so nice having
you around, sweetheart.

01:02:43.427 --> 01:02:46.027
- Well, it's only
until Mom feels better.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:47.496
- Hmm.

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:50.899
- I figured, uh, Mel could
use a little help around here.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:53.568
- Aw, you're
such a good daughter.

01:02:53.570 --> 01:02:54.536
- Aw.

01:02:54.538 --> 01:02:55.637
- You're both good girls.

01:02:55.639 --> 01:02:57.072
- Thanks, Grandma.

01:02:57.074 --> 01:03:00.041
- Yeah, we gotta do
something about your mother.

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.577
She's crazy.

01:03:02.579 --> 01:03:06.548
- Well, I think we
have a solution.

01:03:08.318 --> 01:03:11.286
We're getting a
paranormal expert.

01:03:11.288 --> 01:03:14.389
- For the record, I'm
against all of it, okay?

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.992
Because there are scam
artists out there,

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:19.427
scam artists, and I
don't trust any of them.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:22.898
- For the record,
our mom is possessed.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.033
So we don't have a choice.

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.403
- We're getting a
paranormal expert.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.871
What about these guys?

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:32.240
Chip and Ronnie,
they're brothers.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:36.211
They claim to be the real deal,
I mean, and they're cheap.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:37.345
- Well, they're cute.

01:03:38.849 --> 01:03:39.981
One of them is blind.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.018
Oh, my god, he'd
be great for you.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.187
- Why are you so mean?

01:03:45.189 --> 01:03:46.021
- You love me.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:47.589
Let's watch the video.

01:03:47.591 --> 01:03:49.357
- Hi, that's my brother, Ronnie.

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:50.892
- And that's my brother, Chip.

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:54.129
- And we're
the Polter-Guys.

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:56.464
- We're paranormal
investigators you can trust.

01:03:56.466 --> 01:03:57.999
- Are you afraid to go to sleep?

01:03:58.001 --> 01:03:59.534
- Is someone in your
family possessed.

01:03:59.536 --> 01:04:02.337
- Call us and we'll give
you a free consultation.

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.005
- You got nothing left to lose.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.841
- Except evil spirits.

01:04:07.377 --> 01:04:09.444
- Whooo-ooo-ooo.

01:04:09.446 --> 01:04:11.746
- Really, these dorks?
- Ma.

01:04:11.748 --> 01:04:13.315
- I mean, they're
total strangers.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:14.883
- Mom, please.

01:04:14.885 --> 01:04:16.284
Dad's gone.

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.286
We're scared.
- And look at you.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.223
- Yeah, well, can't we just
think of something else?

01:04:21.225 --> 01:04:22.858
- What?

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:23.758
- I don't know.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:24.993
- Hospital?
- No.

01:04:24.995 --> 01:04:26.361
- Mental ward?
- No, no.

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:27.963
I don't want that.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:29.431
- That's not gonna work anyway.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:32.801
I think we can all agree that
this is about Aunt Marion.

01:04:32.803 --> 01:04:34.402
We need to try these guys.

01:04:34.404 --> 01:04:35.570
- Yeah.

01:04:35.572 --> 01:04:36.838
I'm afraid to mess
with the spirits again.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.073
- Yeah, well, we are, too.

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:41.676
But we have to do
something for your sake.

01:04:51.889 --> 01:04:53.054
- Where are the ashes?

01:04:54.958 --> 01:04:56.291
- The vacuum.

01:04:56.293 --> 01:04:58.026
- We had a little accident.

01:04:58.028 --> 01:04:59.261
- That's not good.

01:04:59.263 --> 01:05:00.595
Is it just you three?

01:05:00.597 --> 01:05:03.131
- Well, our Uncle
Jay, but he's in L.A.

01:05:03.133 --> 01:05:06.134
- And our dad, sort of.

01:05:06.136 --> 01:05:07.102
- Where is he?

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:09.170
- He left.

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:11.006
We haven't heard from him since.

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:14.075
He was a recovered drug addict.

01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:16.311
- Yeah, we think he relapsed.

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:18.046
His phone is not working.

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:20.048
- That royally sucks, I'm sorry.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:25.754
This is her, your Aunt Marion?

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:26.821
- Yes.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:28.390
- Why would she be mad at you?

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:30.792
- What makes you
think she's mad?

01:05:30.794 --> 01:05:32.060
- She's tormenting your family,

01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:34.696
and my guess is
you've looked better.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.235
- Well, when me and
my brother were young,

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:43.405
we found humor in Aunt Marion.

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:45.740
You know, she was, she
was a bit of a nut job.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:47.876
- Found humor, you mean
you laughed at her.

01:05:47.878 --> 01:05:50.578
- Yeah, but I apologized.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:52.847
I contacted her
with a spirit board.

01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:54.482
- Didn't work, did it?

01:05:54.484 --> 01:05:55.784
- No.

01:05:55.786 --> 01:05:57.018
Why not?

01:05:57.020 --> 01:05:58.253
- You apologized to get
yourself off the hook,

01:05:58.255 --> 01:05:59.721
not because you felt
bad for what you did.

01:05:59.723 --> 01:06:01.756
So, big difference.

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:03.258
- Can you help us?

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:06.428
- We can't promise,
but we think so.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.730
- Listen, guys, I don't
wanna sound skeptical here,

01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:11.132
but how do I know you're
qualified for this?

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:11.967
- Mom.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:13.401
- What, I'm just asking.

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:14.803
- Fair enough.

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.938
We used to be in
a local rock band.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:18.173
- We were playing
in a club one night,

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:19.841
and on the way home a
drunk driver hit us.

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:22.644
- The driver was killed and
we were pretty banged up.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.613
- Ronnie went to a coma and
they say I died on the table,

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:28.149
but 47 seconds later, I'm back.

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:29.384
Still in darkness, though.

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.753
- And I came to in the
middle of the night.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:32.988
I heard a voice.

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:35.657
It was the driver
saying he was sorry.

01:06:35.659 --> 01:06:37.192
- I was in the bed
next to Ronnie.

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:39.694
I woke up and I
could see the guy

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.529
just covered in blood
from the accident.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:44.466
- You're blind and you can--
- See the spirits.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:45.667
Can't hear 'em, though.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:47.469
Makes for some pretty
fucked up nights.

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.536
- I can hear 'em.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:50.138
Never once saw them.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.141
Ironic, but in the spirit
world, Chip is my eyes.

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:56.911
- So we decided to
try and use this gift

01:06:56.913 --> 01:06:58.580
to try and help people.

01:06:58.582 --> 01:07:01.416
- Look, we don't have
an agenda here, Ellyn,

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.917
except to help you.

01:07:02.919 --> 01:07:06.354
And from the looks of
things, you need help.

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:10.692
- Why do they have
to hypnotize me?

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:13.228
- Because you've had contact
with Aunt Marion, Mom.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.064
- For some reason, she wants
to make herself known to you.

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:18.633
- I had a stroke.

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:19.467
- We know.

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:20.568
That may actually help.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.904
Your brain's been altered.

01:07:22.906 --> 01:07:25.206
It might make an easier
portal for the spirit.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:27.509
- But we can't hypnotize
someone who doesn't wanna do it,

01:07:27.511 --> 01:07:29.944
so we need you to
be okay with it.

01:07:29.946 --> 01:07:32.647
- Is that the only way
you can contact her?

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:34.282
- We found hypnosis
to be the best way

01:07:34.284 --> 01:07:36.017
to summon spirits to us.
- Yeah.

01:07:37.154 --> 01:07:39.554
- Can
anything bad happen?

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:42.357
- There's
some risk for us, too.

01:07:43.927 --> 01:07:44.993
- Please, Ma.

01:07:46.763 --> 01:07:49.731
What do I have to do?

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:57.639
- All right, Caroline.

01:07:57.641 --> 01:08:01.576
I want you to close your
eyes, clear your mind,

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:04.412
and listen to the
sound of the metronome.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:06.414
Can you do that
for me, Caroline?

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.482
- I'll try.

01:08:10.887 --> 01:08:15.957
- Focus on your breathing,
slow, deep breaths.

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:21.196
Clear your thoughts.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:25.133
Let yourself relax.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:30.037
Feel yourself sinking
deeper into your chair.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:33.073
Can you hear me, Caroline?

01:08:33.076 --> 01:08:34.142
- Yes.

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:39.747
- I want you to see yourself
outside Aunt Marion's house.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:44.352
Now, as you make your
way to the front door,

01:08:44.354 --> 01:08:46.754
I want you to feel more
relaxed with each step.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.457
Make your way to the
front door, Caroline.

01:08:53.063 --> 01:08:54.028
Are you there now?

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:55.964
- Yes.

01:08:57.067 --> 01:08:58.433
- The door opens.

01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:01.336
Walk through the door.

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:06.841
Once you're through,
ask Marion to join you.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:09.743
- Marion.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:13.881
- She's here.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.326
- What, Mom.
- Grandma.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.095
- Ma.

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.363
Ma.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.832
- Marion is saying
she deserves this.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.233
Did your mom love
your Aunt Marion?

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:33.167
- I don't know.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:33.968
I don't, I don't think so.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.236
- Did she laugh at her?

01:09:35.238 --> 01:09:36.904
- Yes, she laughed a
lot with her sister,

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:39.040
our other aunt,
our favorite aunt.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:45.013
- She's strangling her.

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:48.983
- Marion, I want you to
return to the other world.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.484
You don't belong here.

01:09:50.487 --> 01:09:53.287
What they did was wrong,
but people make mistakes.

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.823
And this is your
brother's family.

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:57.892
She's saying he deserved better.

01:09:57.894 --> 01:09:58.826
- No!

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.373
No, no!

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.042
- She's gone.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:15.143
- Aunt Marion, no!

01:10:15.145 --> 01:10:16.945
Aunt Marion, no!

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:18.012
God, stop.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:21.516
Mom.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:28.856
- Grandma died.

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:35.863
- We found an envelope
marked last wishes,

01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:40.201
and she wanted to be
buried with our grandpa.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:46.241
- That's why she didn't want
me to bury Aunt Marion there.

01:10:48.645 --> 01:10:49.611
- I hope Grandma can help us

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:54.315
now that she's watching over us.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.254
- Chip and Ronnie have
been staying with us.

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:03.825
They feel terrible about
what happened, but honestly,

01:11:08.164 --> 01:11:10.164
I don't know what
we'd do without them.

01:11:17.007 --> 01:11:20.475
So this is all you guys do?

01:11:20.477 --> 01:11:21.943
Come to the rescue
of people like us?

01:11:21.945 --> 01:11:23.745
- There's not a lot
of people like you.

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:25.213
- Most of the time
it's people swearing

01:11:25.215 --> 01:11:27.282
they're hearing noises.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.483
Usually, it leads to nothing.

01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:30.351
- So why do you guys do it?

01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:31.986
- People like you.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.388
- So we're the worst.

01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:36.557
- No, we had one
that was pretty bad.

01:11:36.559 --> 01:11:38.926
- What happened?
- Angry spirit.

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.261
Possessed the family dog.

01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:42.063
Dog attacked and killed
their five-year-old son.

01:11:42.065 --> 01:11:43.431
- They shot the dog.

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:44.666
- Aw.

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:45.433
- And the spirit
went into the dad.

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:46.868
- Oh, that's terrible.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.303
- The dad tried
to kill his wife,

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:50.438
but we were able to
drive out the spirit

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:51.439
in the nick of time.

01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.373
- How?

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:53.441
- Seance.

01:11:54.377 --> 01:11:56.411
- I don't think I could
do what you guys do

01:11:57.614 --> 01:11:59.580
even if I had the gift.

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:01.082
- Mind if I ask,

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:03.518
did all of you get your
kicks laughing at your aunt?

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.053
- Oh, no.

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:06.988
I mean, she was weird.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.957
- Sometimes we'd be sitting
around the dinner table,

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:14.429
me, my brother, my mom, and
we'd all be crying laughing

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.698
at some of the things
Aunt Marion did.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:17.899
- What did your day say?

01:12:17.901 --> 01:12:19.100
It was his sister.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:20.935
- You know, he
never said anything.

01:12:22.238 --> 01:12:23.705
And until this very moment,

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:27.709
I never really thought how
that must have made him feel.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:30.912
Oh, god, I am a bad person.

01:12:30.914 --> 01:12:33.047
- We've all done things
we're not proud of.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:37.452
- Yeah, well, my brother Jay
would handle this way better.

01:12:37.454 --> 01:12:41.055
- Something like this
isn't easy for anyone.

01:12:41.057 --> 01:12:42.690
- Goddamn it.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:43.791
Damn it, ugh.

01:12:45.628 --> 01:12:47.261
- We just need to find
out what Marion needs

01:12:47.263 --> 01:12:48.730
in order to forgive you.

01:12:48.732 --> 01:12:51.099
- But what, what could
she possibly want from me?

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:55.303
- We don't know
what Marion wants from Ellyn.

01:12:55.305 --> 01:12:58.239
If we did, we could use
that as a bargaining chip.

01:12:58.241 --> 01:13:00.308
- Maybe we'll have a
seance, blood seance.

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:02.043
It might be the
last chance we have

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.746
to drag Marion's
spirit from this house.

01:13:04.748 --> 01:13:06.047
- Before she kills Ellyn.

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:16.924
We sedated Ellyn for
everyone's safety.

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:24.799
- Got it.

01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.501
- You can put
it on the table, Camille.

01:13:29.873 --> 01:13:30.938
- Ready for this?

01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.711
You guys just
nodded, didn't you?

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.045
- Oh, sorry.

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:39.747
Yeah, all ready.

01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:39.240
- I think one of you
better do your mom.

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:41.476
- You're right there.

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:44.912
- Fine.

01:14:48.318 --> 01:14:49.383
Mom?

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:51.686
I just need to poke your hand

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:53.454
with the top of
this knife, okay?

01:14:54.424 --> 01:14:55.490
Just a little prick.

01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:08.436
- Good job.

01:15:14.711 --> 01:15:15.776
Let's begin.

01:15:31.461 --> 01:15:33.828
We are here for
you, Aunt Marion.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:36.497
We welcome you to our seance.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:38.933
- We are here
for you, Aunt Marion.

01:15:38.935 --> 01:15:41.168
We welcome you to our seance.

01:15:42.272 --> 01:15:44.572
We are here for
you, Aunt Marion.

01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.974
We welcome you to our seance.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:02.456
And we have company.

01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:08.563
- Laughed at me.

01:16:11.134 --> 01:16:13.534
- She knew that
you laughed at her.

01:16:15.038 --> 01:16:17.872
She knew that you didn't
care if she lived or die.

01:16:19.876 --> 01:16:22.777
She says the only one who
cared about her in her family

01:16:22.779 --> 01:16:24.045
was her brother.

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:37.491
He never even wanted

01:16:37.493 --> 01:16:39.393
a fucking daughter.

01:16:41.297 --> 01:16:43.698
You belong here.

01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:06.854
- Mom.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.289
Oh, my god.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.190
Mom!

01:17:10.059 --> 01:17:11.359
- Ronnie.

01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:15.162
What's happening to them?

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:24.105
Mom, no!

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:25.539
Mom!

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:26.374
- Come here.

01:17:26.376 --> 01:17:27.541
- Go, go, go!

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:31.545
Spirits drag me in this
place by water by water

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:33.748
and fire by fire.

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:41.889
Let this evil be free
through time and space.

01:17:42.058 --> 01:17:43.958
- Though I walk in the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.495
I will fear no evil
for though art with me,

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:50.531
thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:01.776
- We did it.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.044
- Chip, are you all right?

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.613
- I couldn't see anyway, right?

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:09.383
- This
is too dangerous.

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:11.585
- Chip and
Ronnie aren't coming back.

01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:17.191
- And our mom has been
sleeping since the seance.

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:21.262
It's a good thing, right?

01:18:22.498 --> 01:18:23.497
- Maybe it's over?

01:18:26.135 --> 01:18:27.201
- Yeah.

01:18:32.341 --> 01:18:33.374
You know, you don't
have to text me.

01:18:33.376 --> 01:18:34.642
I'm in the other room.

01:18:34.644 --> 01:18:35.910
- I didn't know if you
were sleeping or not.

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.144
- Who could sleep?

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:38.779
- Well, Ronnie just text me.

01:18:38.781 --> 01:18:41.282
I mean, they just left the ER.

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:43.217
Chip's gonna be okay.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.119
Still blind but really hungry.

01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:48.522
- Well, that's
good news at least.

01:18:48.524 --> 01:18:50.124
- What are we gonna do?

01:18:51.828 --> 01:18:55.229
- Call another ghost person
or somebody who knows

01:18:55.231 --> 01:18:56.097
how to deal with this.
- No.

01:18:56.099 --> 01:18:57.765
No, we can't risk it.

01:18:57.767 --> 01:18:59.233
We already lost Grandma.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:00.468
- Can we just talk about
this in the morning, please?

01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:01.936
- Oh, wait, wait.

01:19:01.938 --> 01:19:03.971
Would you sleep in
here with me tonight?

01:19:05.241 --> 01:19:06.307
- Shut up.

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:10.111
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:12.513
- I need a pillow.

01:19:29.332 --> 01:19:31.165
Maybe we should call Uncle Jay.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.434
We should tell
him what happened.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.036
- I don't know, Mel.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.273
Uncle Jay is safe where he's at.

01:19:40.576 --> 01:19:43.110
If we call him, what if
something bad happens to him?

01:19:44.547 --> 01:19:45.746
- I guess you're right.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:48.883
Let's call him now.
- Yeah.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:53.287
- Hey, what's up?

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:54.822
- Uncle Jay.

01:19:54.824 --> 01:19:55.756
- Oh, my god, okay, listen.
- Okay, we had this seance.

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:01.595
- She looks like

01:20:01.597 --> 01:20:04.298
straight shit.
- We're really scared.

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:09.537
- Has she been sleeping
this whole time?

01:20:09.539 --> 01:20:10.604
- Yup.

01:20:11.374 --> 01:20:12.606
We tried to wake her,

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:16.243
but she just moans and
goes back to sleep.

01:20:16.245 --> 01:20:18.112
- And the rope?

01:20:18.114 --> 01:20:20.080
- I just figured we
can't be too sure.

01:20:21.217 --> 01:20:22.449
- Okay.

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:24.285
Well, we need to get
her to a hospital.

01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:26.887
There's somebody in the
psych ward that can help her.

01:20:26.889 --> 01:20:29.824
- This is so much more than
psychological, Uncle Jay.

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:30.825
- Look at her.

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:32.126
- I know

01:20:32.128 --> 01:20:34.829
I know, but this is
way out of our league,

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:37.164
and at least she'll
be safe there.

01:20:37.166 --> 01:20:38.365
And we'll be safe.

01:20:39.802 --> 01:20:42.236
- Maybe when she wakes up
she'll be back to normal.

01:20:42.238 --> 01:20:43.470
Can we please just wait?

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.240
- Okay.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:48.909
Until she wakes up.

01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:51.779
You guys go get some rest
and I'm gonna keep watch.

01:21:13.135 --> 01:21:15.269
- Camille.
- What's wrong?

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:17.771
- I'm thirsty.

01:21:17.773 --> 01:21:19.039
Girl.

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:22.443
- Camille,
I'm thirsty, please.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:25.012
Camille.
- Okay.

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:27.748
Come on.

01:21:39.695 --> 01:21:40.895
She's sleeping.

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:43.130
- Just checking.

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:57.211
- Oh, shit.
- Camille.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:21:59.713
- Come on, let's go.
- No.

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:01.215
- Yes.
- No, no, no, no.

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:08.255
- Come on, let's go.

01:22:16.699 --> 01:22:19.767
- They laughed at me!

01:22:21.537 --> 01:22:24.605
He was dead!

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:26.407
- Mom, what have you done?

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:27.474
- Run!

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.780
- No, no, don't!

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.820
- Melanie!

01:22:39.822 --> 01:22:40.888
Stop!

01:22:42.825 --> 01:22:47.895
Stop it!

01:22:54.070 --> 01:22:55.069
Let's go.

01:22:55.071 --> 01:22:56.904
We gotta go now,
we gotta go now.

01:22:56.906 --> 01:22:59.139
Uncle Jay, come on.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.374
Let's go.

01:23:02.745 --> 01:23:04.244
Okay, okay, I got you.

01:23:04.246 --> 01:23:06.981
I got you, I got you, I got you.

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:32.206
- Who's laughing now?

01:23:53.496 --> 01:23:54.661
- I can't
hold it, Camille.

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:56.663
What do we do?
- Come on, come on.

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:57.731
Come on.

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:31.932
- Ellyn, it's me.

01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:33.333
It's your brother!

01:24:33.335 --> 01:24:35.335
Your favorite brother!

01:24:35.337 --> 01:24:36.303
Ellyn, don't do this.

01:24:36.305 --> 01:24:38.338
Don't let her do this.

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:39.406
Ellyn, stop.

01:24:40.209 --> 01:24:41.775
Stop!

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.191
Funny.

01:25:31.193 --> 01:25:33.227
Dad was the one who actually
wanted to be cremated,

01:25:33.229 --> 01:25:35.162
yet we buried him.

01:25:35.164 --> 01:25:38.599
- Our mom, she couldn't
bear to burn her daddy.

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:43.704
- We're gonna bury her
ashes with him later.

01:25:43.706 --> 01:25:45.772
We know that's what she'd want.

01:25:45.774 --> 01:25:46.940
And then tomorrow?

01:25:47.710 --> 01:25:48.775
- We go to L.A.

01:25:50.179 --> 01:25:51.578
- We need a little getaway.

01:25:52.982 --> 01:25:55.182
- You guys can stay a while.

01:25:55.184 --> 01:25:56.984
You could stay as
long as you want.

01:25:58.087 --> 01:25:59.853
- Like a year?

01:25:59.855 --> 01:26:00.921
- Like forever?

01:26:04.026 --> 01:26:05.192
I miss her so much.

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:07.895
- I know.

01:26:07.897 --> 01:26:09.763
Me, too.

01:26:09.765 --> 01:26:12.199
It's over now and
we're gonna be okay.

01:26:34.657 --> 01:26:35.789
- Uncle Jay?

01:26:39.261 --> 01:26:41.195
Fuck.

01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:42.062
Just wait here.
- No.

01:26:42.064 --> 01:26:43.764
There's no way, no.

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:45.265
No, no.

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:47.801
Please, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:27:00.749 --> 01:27:01.715
- Hello?

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:05.452
Uncle Jay?

01:28:01.477 --> 01:28:04.311
- There's
no one there.

01:28:29.371 --> 01:28:31.238
- Dad!

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:45.419
- Nearly sober.

01:28:47.289 --> 01:28:48.355
Again.

01:28:50.626 --> 01:28:53.827
- We were pretty angry
when he came home at first,

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:58.899
but after losing Mom,
Grandma, and Uncle Jay,

01:29:00.803 --> 01:29:02.602
- at least we got our dad back.

01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:05.205
- Yeah.

01:29:06.275 --> 01:29:07.274
I hate that I left.

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:10.010
I was wrong.

01:29:11.380 --> 01:29:13.747
But I'm here now, okay?

01:29:15.084 --> 01:29:17.718
And I'm never gonna leave
you girls ever again.

01:29:19.054 --> 01:29:20.120
You're all I got.

01:29:29.164 --> 01:29:30.230
- What's wrong?

01:29:31.934 --> 01:29:33.066
- Nothing.

01:29:33.068 --> 01:29:36.670
Uh, I was just thinking
