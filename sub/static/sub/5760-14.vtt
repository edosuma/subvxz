00:05.050 --> 00:07.500
Ghost Whisperer
Season 01 Episode 14

00:07.850 --> 00:10.300
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.100
I just got married,

00:13.150 --> 00:14.600
just moved to a small town,

00:14.750 --> 00:16.600
just opened up an antique shop.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.630
I might be just like you.

00:19.650 --> 00:21.550
Except from the time that I was a little girl,

00:21.600 --> 00:23.500
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.000
It's all right,honey.

00:26.050 --> 00:28.500
Earthbound spirits,my grandmother called them,

00:28.600 --> 00:30.000
the ones who have not crossed over yet

00:30.050 --> 00:32.100
because they have unfinished business with the living,

00:32.150 --> 00:33.850
and they come to me for help.

00:35.050 --> 00:36.500
To tell you my story,

00:36.700 --> 00:38.550
I have to tell you theirs.

00:48.950 --> 00:51.050
Do you have to suffer to be an artist?

00:51.100 --> 00:53.650
No. I just think it gives you an edge over the competition.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.000
Wouldn't you trade an ear for immortality?

00:56.050 --> 00:56.900
How about a finger?

00:56.950 --> 00:58.150
I got 10 of those.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.950
Someone's got to hear yourself.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.050
These are amazing.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.550
They're a little bleak for me.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.150
Well,life can be bleak.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.700
Another optimist heard from.

01:05.750 --> 01:06.750
What are you drinking?

01:06.800 --> 01:07.850
He's just tired.

01:07.900 --> 01:09.250
Look at the eyes.

01:09.350 --> 01:11.050
Yeah,the eyes of a killer.

01:11.150 --> 01:13.100
Clete youngblood murdered a man in '89

01:13.150 --> 01:15.000
and spent years on death row.

01:15.050 --> 01:17.000
Last man hanged in the state in '93.

01:17.260 --> 01:20.500
Rumor has it that a german industrialist bought the whole collection,

01:20.550 --> 01:22.250
and right after this,it's being shipped off to europe.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.450
How did we get invited to this?

01:24.500 --> 01:25.950
See that guy over there?

01:26.850 --> 01:28.250
Came into the shop last week.

01:28.350 --> 01:31.500
Alan rowe. A tad bit pompous.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.100
You lying son of a bitch.

01:43.150 --> 01:44.100
Hello,leslie.

01:44.150 --> 01:46.850
You told me you were honoring clete youngblood.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.700
This isn't supposed to be about an execution.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.400
This isn't about a killer!

01:51.450 --> 01:54.300
This is supposed to be about an artist and his work!

01:54.350 --> 01:56.150
That is why I lent you the painting.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.950
Not for this!

02:09.300 --> 02:10.199
Let go of me!

02:10.250 --> 02:10.900
Let her go.

02:10.949 --> 02:12.100
This is mine!

02:12.600 --> 02:14.000
Let her go.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.600
Don't look at me.

02:17.700 --> 02:19.550
You're the fools here.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.600
Celebrating a man's execution.

02:21.650 --> 02:23.400
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,rowe.

02:23.450 --> 02:24.150
You're right. You're right.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.650
I should've let you know what I had in mind.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.950
Now,please,take your painting and go home before I call the police.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.850
-No,I'm not finished. -Yes,you are.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.900
Take her out.

03:25.150 --> 03:26.050
Excuse me.

03:26.100 --> 03:28.750
If I could just talk to you for a minute,please.

03:28.800 --> 03:29.900
My name is Melinda.

03:29.950 --> 03:31.650
What do you want?

03:31.750 --> 03:32.900
Your painting.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.450
There's something very special about it.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.300
Where did you get it?

03:35.350 --> 03:37.700
It was given to me by the artist.

03:38.300 --> 03:39.500
It's very valuable.

03:40.450 --> 03:41.600
Yeah? You think?

03:41.750 --> 03:43.500
Well,maybe I should sell it.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.200
Maybe I should sell it to you.

03:45.250 --> 03:46.850
Then I'd be able to buy pretty dresses

03:46.900 --> 03:49.200
and go to swanky parties like you do.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.400
Hey,I'm sorry I bothered you.

03:51.450 --> 03:52.650
Look,I...

03:53.700 --> 03:56.400
he was my father.The artist.

03:56.750 --> 03:58.750
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

03:58.850 --> 03:59.850
Of course you didn't.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.500
I barely knew. He died when I was 8.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.000
Look,I know this is gonna sound weird,

04:06.100 --> 04:08.950
but do you ever feel your father's presence?

04:09.050 --> 04:10.550
All the time.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.550
He's always with me.

04:12.700 --> 04:15.000
If I didn't think he was watching me

04:15.050 --> 04:18.700
and I was going through this crap all by myself...

04:20.050 --> 04:22.100
my father was a genius. You don't kill genius.

04:22.150 --> 04:23.150
He wasn't a murderer.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.050
He didn't deserve to die. He was set up.

04:25.100 --> 04:26.850
He was an innocent man.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.500
If you ever wanna talk...

04:31.750 --> 04:33.650
I talk too much.

04:41.850 --> 04:43.000
Everything ok?

04:43.450 --> 04:44.700
I don't know.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.000
That girl. There's something about that painting.

04:48.550 --> 04:49.600
Hey,do they...

04:50.000 --> 04:51.950
do they still hang people?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.100
I'm sure they do somewhere.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.500
What about here?

04:56.300 --> 04:59.350
The last man executed by hanging in the United States

04:59.400 --> 05:03.900
was billy bailey,september 25,1996,delaware.

05:04.300 --> 05:05.350
Impressed,huh?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.050
How did you know that?

05:07.650 --> 05:09.700
I read it in the brochure. Come on.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.200
He chose hanging over lethal injection.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.100
He was a purist.

05:14.150 --> 05:15.650
Could you cut it out?

05:15.700 --> 05:18.100
I got to go home to an empty apartment.

05:18.150 --> 05:19.050
Thank you.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.100
SorrY.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.550
Good-bye.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.000
Sweet dreams.

05:23.400 --> 05:24.600
Night.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.000
So...

05:34.800 --> 05:36.200
that was fun.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.300
Yeah. We should do that more often.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.500
How about tomorrow?

05:39.550 --> 05:41.450
Oh,I can't. I'm busy.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.800
Married.

05:44.150 --> 05:46.200
You didn't tell me about that.

05:48.550 --> 05:49.450
What the...

05:49.500 --> 05:51.150
oh,my god. Am I bleeding?

05:51.600 --> 05:54.550
No. It's...it's paint.

05:54.650 --> 05:56.200
-Paint? -Yeah.

05:56.300 --> 05:57.700
In my hair.

05:58.850 --> 05:59.750
Gross.

05:59.840 --> 06:00.550
Eww.

06:00.570 --> 06:02.610
...gallary

06:03.750 --> 06:05.200
It figures the one night we go out,

06:05.250 --> 06:06.650
I get paint on my hair.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.300
It's not too much.

06:10.100 --> 06:12.100
It's not funny.

06:13.650 --> 06:15.600
I'm gonna go wash this off.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.500
Oh. The shower's broken.

06:18.750 --> 06:19.300
Again?

06:19.350 --> 06:21.500
I forgot to tell you. I'll fix it tomorrow.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.950
You can use the kitchen sink. I do it all the time.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.450
I really wish you hadn't told me that.

07:04.450 --> 07:07.150
Jim! Jim!

07:46.600 --> 07:48.000
It's all right.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.299
What happened? What happened?

08:38.350 --> 08:40.450
we are not alone. it is still here.

08:42.900 --> 08:46.100
Come on. It's all right. It's ok.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.650
You're all right.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.850
Hey,you're here early.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.350
Yeah. I couldn't sleep.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.950
Oh,what's that gonna be?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.800
The house I grew up in.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.150
Wow. You cut your hair.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.400
In a manner of speaking.

09:07.500 --> 09:08.300
Who did it?

09:08.350 --> 09:10.600
Jim and freddy kruger.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.700
It's a long story.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.550
Coffee? I can't keep my eyes open.

09:13.600 --> 09:14.800
Yeah,ok.

09:15.450 --> 09:17.200
You know,it looks great.

09:17.350 --> 09:18.650
Your hair,I mean.

09:18.700 --> 09:21.000
Good. I'll make an appointment for you.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.000
Andrea.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.150
Did anybody see what happened here?

09:29.450 --> 09:33.000
Are you there? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

09:37.900 --> 09:39.150
Is she ok?

09:45.800 --> 09:46.700
What happened?

09:46.750 --> 09:49.500
Nothing. You just stopped breathing for a little while.

09:49.550 --> 09:51.000
You gave us a scare.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.550
You saved my life.

09:52.650 --> 09:54.000
NaH. I was just in the neighborhood.

09:54.050 --> 09:56.050
Thank you. Thank you.

09:56.100 --> 09:56.700
You relax.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.450
This good man's gonna take care of you.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.850
Relax until the ambulances get here.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.200
It is loud.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.300
Man,maybe I should start fainting in front of firehouses.

10:08.350 --> 10:08.900
Are you kidding me?

10:08.950 --> 10:10.500
They would knock each other down to get to you.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.000
Paramedics,cops,boy scouts.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.000
Well,that's not the house I grew up in.

10:57.900 --> 10:59.250
Fascinating,isn't it?

10:59.400 --> 11:01.700
The man I bought these things from found them hidden

11:01.750 --> 11:03.450
in the wall of a prison he helped renovate,

11:03.500 --> 11:06.000
as if someone was ashamed of it.

11:06.850 --> 11:08.100
Of all the means of execution,

11:08.150 --> 11:10.600
pain to me seems the most cruel,don't you think?

11:10.650 --> 11:12.250
I'm not really crazy about any of them.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.650
No,no. Think of this.

11:13.700 --> 11:16.550
In the late 1800s,it was a sign of class inbreeding

11:16.600 --> 11:19.450
when you could afford to pay children to hang on to your legs

11:19.500 --> 11:23.300
after you dropped through the trapdoor to ensure a quick death.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.450
Do you know any happy stories,Mr. Rowe?

11:25.500 --> 11:26.500
I'm sorry.

11:26.550 --> 11:28.050
Ooh,this is colorful.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.750
It's a youngblood,isn't it?

11:31.050 --> 11:32.150
Where did you get this?

11:32.200 --> 11:34.150
I found it in my shop this morning.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
I don't understand.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.350
Neither do I.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.850
Well,the paint's still fresh.

11:38.950 --> 11:40.350
Strange,huh?

11:40.550 --> 11:42.950
Whoever did this was obviously an expert.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.400
Same thick brush strokes,same color palette.

11:45.450 --> 11:46.750
Even has clete's mark in the corner.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.200
But as we know,dead men don't paint.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.100
And I know every one of his pieces,

11:52.150 --> 11:56.450
so if I haven't seen it,it doesn't exist.

11:56.500 --> 11:57.850
What are you going to do with this thing?

11:57.900 --> 12:00.200
Well,I was hoping to show it to clete youngblood's daughter.

12:00.250 --> 12:01.450
Why would you wanna do that?

12:01.500 --> 12:04.000
Well,that would be between me and leslie.

12:04.050 --> 12:05.650
Do you know where I might find her?

12:05.700 --> 12:08.350
My advice to you,miss gordon,would be to steer clear.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.250
She's got her father's temper. I know.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.650
I've been dealing with her erratic behavior for years.

12:12.700 --> 12:13.950
Were you a friend of the family?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.750
There is no family.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.600
Clete went to jail when she was 4.

12:17.650 --> 12:19.400
At 8 he was executed.

12:19.450 --> 12:22.350
Over the years,she's convinced herself that he was innocent,

12:22.400 --> 12:24.300
that they murdered him.

12:24.650 --> 12:26.000
Do you think clete was innocent?

12:26.050 --> 12:28.050
We got him one of the top attorneys in town.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.500
We gave him the best defense we could.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.000
He was broke,of course.

12:32.050 --> 12:34.200
Paid me back in paintings.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.200
You didn't answer my question.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.700
Sorry. It'll have to do.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.000
Now,getting back to leslie.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.000
I don't think she's stable.

12:44.050 --> 12:47.250
Noted. Do you have her address?

12:47.850 --> 12:50.550
She probably wouldn't want me to give it to you.

12:51.550 --> 12:53.550
So I will.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.350
Going away?

13:10.300 --> 13:13.400
My landlord lost his sense of humor about not being paid.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.000
Sorry.

13:15.050 --> 13:16.750
So where are you gonna go now?

13:16.800 --> 13:18.500
Nowhere. I'm here.

13:18.550 --> 13:20.300
You're gonna live in your van?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.750
Look,what do you want?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.400
How did you find me?

13:23.450 --> 13:25.800
Alan rowe gave me your address.

13:26.950 --> 13:28.900
Are you a friend of his?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.050
No.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.500
Well,that's something you've got going for you.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.000
Hey,I really wanna help you.

13:34.050 --> 13:35.750
What,you're gonna offer me money or something?

13:35.800 --> 13:37.400
Am I a charity case to you?

13:37.450 --> 13:40.000
Well,you could always sell your father's painting.

13:40.050 --> 13:42.650
I'd rather live in the street than sell this painting.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.100
It's all I have left of him.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.750
It keeps me connected to him.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.250
I understand.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.900
Yeah? What do you understand?

13:50.100 --> 13:51.700
That he's still with you.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.450
Look,I don't need your pity,lady.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.600
I can take care of myself.

13:54.650 --> 13:56.850
Leslie,please,your father's still here.

13:58.350 --> 14:01.400
I mean,really here. I've seen him.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.300
What did you just say?

14:05.150 --> 14:06.750
Your father's spirit is still here.

14:06.800 --> 14:09.450
And I know how this sounds,so please forgive me.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.550
He's still here and he has a message for you.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.000
If you could just let me show you what he left for me...please.

14:15.050 --> 14:17.200
Leslie,I have to show you.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.150
Where did you come from?

14:35.950 --> 14:37.900
I don't know why somebody would do that either,mr. Rowe.

14:37.950 --> 14:40.600
But there you have it. The bag was in my car.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.900
Well,if you wouldn't mind.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.200
Yeah. That would save me a trip.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.100
Ok. Thanks. Bye.

14:49.350 --> 14:52.700
Is it just me or is everyone in this town weird?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.800
That's a rhetorical question,right?

14:54.850 --> 14:56.550
No. I want an answer.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.750
All right.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.900
I think you have the unique innate ability

14:59.950 --> 15:02.150
to bring out the strangeness in other people.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.600
How does that sound?

15:03.950 --> 15:05.000
Rather sweet.

15:05.150 --> 15:06.400
I try.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.050
Andrea.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.850
Can I talk to you for a second outside?

15:18.250 --> 15:21.200
She claims I injured her ribs and bruised her

15:21.250 --> 15:23.650
while I was reviving her. They're calling it negligence.

15:23.700 --> 15:25.550
I can't believe it. You saved that woman's life.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.750
How can she get away with this?

15:27.800 --> 15:28.800
She's got a doctor's report,a lawyer.

15:28.850 --> 15:30.700
And she's in the hospital. It's pretty easy actually.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.700
You just fill out the forms. The investigation begins.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.100
Yeah,but aren't you protected from this by the county?

15:36.250 --> 15:38.600
That's the problem. Technically,I was off duty.

15:38.650 --> 15:40.750
She's suing me personally,the squad,

15:40.800 --> 15:43.250
the village of grandview,the county of driscoll.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.200
-What are you gonna do? -Stay focused.

15:47.350 --> 15:48.650
What can I do?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.350
I just wanted to tell you what was going on.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.000
-Ok. Call me. -I will.

17:52.850 --> 17:55.200
Why are you doing this? What do you want?

17:55.500 --> 17:56.650
Please.

17:56.800 --> 17:58.500
Make this stop.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.850
Make what stop?

18:01.150 --> 18:05.000
Help leslie so this can stop.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.000
Make what stop?

18:20.050 --> 18:24.300
Sometimes spirits who've died a violent death get stuck here,

18:24.350 --> 18:27.150
reliving final moments over and over again.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.150
And maybe...maybe that's what's happening here.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.650
He wants to say something to his daughter.

18:31.700 --> 18:33.500
I keep trying to get them together.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.350
How close are you gonna get to this one?

18:35.400 --> 18:37.650
As close as I have to,I guess.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.800
Oh,man.

18:43.050 --> 18:45.150
You know,it's just a glass. We have others.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.900
I know.

18:48.600 --> 18:50.500
But I like that one.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.700
Hey. How you doing?

18:56.750 --> 19:00.500
Just got this deposition hanging over my head. You know?

19:00.750 --> 19:03.500
I'm sorry. I was going on about my stuff.

19:04.950 --> 19:07.700
It's like you say-- "our stuff."

19:12.700 --> 19:14.000
You know...

19:14.450 --> 19:17.700
tooge thinks this is gonna taint me no matter what.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
It's on my record.

19:20.350 --> 19:23.500
Is this the same bobby tooge  who tried to dry his underwear in the stove

19:23.550 --> 19:26.400
and almost set his kitchen on fire?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.000
Look...

19:30.300 --> 19:34.300
all I'm saying is don't sit around and wait for something to happen.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.600
Why don't you go talk to this lady? You know?

19:36.700 --> 19:38.350
Show her who you are. Try to reason with her.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.600
You...you can be hard to resist.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.100
-It was his socks. -What?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.750
He set his socks on fire,not his underwear.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.900
Oh. My sincerest apologies for my rush to judgment.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.800
Who's that?

20:05.900 --> 20:07.000
Is that geraldo?

20:07.300 --> 20:10.800
Um,mrs. Reese,can I talk to you for a minute?

20:10.950 --> 20:13.650
I thought you were on the box.

20:15.150 --> 20:16.650
You look like geraldo.

20:17.100 --> 20:21.400
Geraldo has a giant mustache. He could've shaved.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.700
Mrs. Reese,I don't know if you remember me or not.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.600
Of course I do,mr. Clancy.

20:25.650 --> 20:27.750
Nice to see you again.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.900
And please,call me brenda.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.500
Brenda,I just wanted to talk to you to see

20:31.550 --> 20:35.450
if we could try to find a solution to this problem without going to the courts.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.450
My lawyer wouldn't like this.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.500
Mrs. Reese,I'm trained to save lives.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.600
That's what I do for a living.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.450
What I did that day in the square...

20:45.500 --> 20:47.500
it was second nature. I didn't think about it.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.800
You needed help. I gave it to you.

20:49.850 --> 20:52.050
But you did it too hard,hon.

20:52.300 --> 20:53.600
You hurt my ribs.

20:53.650 --> 20:54.950
I'm all bruised up.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.500
Because you fell down on concrete before I even got there.

20:58.600 --> 21:02.450
I can barely move. I can't even lift my arms.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.850
Look,hon,it's nothing personal.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.800
My lawyer tells me I got to do this.

21:06.900 --> 21:07.950
So I listen to him.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.400
No,it is personal.

21:09.500 --> 21:11.600
It goes on my record. There are legal fees.

21:11.650 --> 21:15.250
But the county has money put aside for things like this.

21:15.350 --> 21:17.950
I just wanna get what I'm entitled to.

21:18.100 --> 21:20.200
What you're entitled to.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.200
All right.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.000
could you fix it,sweetie?

21:41.750 --> 21:43.200
Thank you.

21:59.400 --> 22:01.900
It's all there,mr. Rowe. Thanks for coming by to get it.

22:01.950 --> 22:02.950
So is this part of the plan,

22:03.000 --> 22:04.850
or would it have been better for you to come to me?

22:04.900 --> 22:06.100
What plan?

22:06.200 --> 22:08.400
I don't know. Whatever you and leslie are hatching.

22:08.450 --> 22:09.850
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.100
Oh,I think you do.

22:11.150 --> 22:12.700
Leslie's got you convinced that there's been

22:12.750 --> 22:14.900
some great injustice done to the youngblood name.

22:14.950 --> 22:16.500
The only thing she's convinced me of

22:16.550 --> 22:18.200
is that she's angry and broke.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.500
Broke? Yes. And yet oddly enough she can still

22:20.550 --> 22:22.800
afford art classes at the wells institute.

22:22.850 --> 22:26.950
Oh,and by the way,if there could ever be money better spent...

22:27.550 --> 22:29.950
miss gordon,don't let her fool you.

22:50.850 --> 22:52.300
Interesting work.

22:52.350 --> 22:53.700
You scared the hell out of me.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.950
Yeah. I get a lot of that.

22:57.150 --> 23:00.750
Um,I always wished that I could draw...paint.

23:00.850 --> 23:02.250
Well,that makes two of us.

23:02.500 --> 23:06.100
Another thing my father neglected to leave me was talent.

23:06.300 --> 23:07.650
No,I disagree.

23:07.850 --> 23:09.550
I think you're very talented.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.650
What do you want?

23:12.300 --> 23:15.000
I need you to take a look at this for me.

23:22.300 --> 23:23.550
Where did you get this?

23:23.600 --> 23:25.650
It showed up at my shop.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.350
The paint was still wet.

23:28.050 --> 23:29.850
Well,that's impossible.

23:30.900 --> 23:34.450
This is his work. No one could fake it that perfectly.

23:34.500 --> 23:39.000
I keep seeing this,even at the gallery. What is it?

23:39.900 --> 23:41.250
when I was little...

23:41.350 --> 23:47.500
**

23:47.750 --> 23:48.850
One Sunday after church,

23:48.900 --> 23:50.550
I went the beach...

23:50.600 --> 23:53.600
when I got home, I give him a present.

23:53.700 --> 23:55.500
A seashell I found.

23:55.700 --> 24:02.500
It's

24:02.650 --> 24:06.950
That's....

24:07.000 --> 24:09.400
So Love

24:09.550 --> 24:11.400
We did everything together.

24:13.300 --> 24:16.000
He told me to always look for that shell on his paintings

24:16.050 --> 24:19.300
so that I would know he was thinking about me when he worked.

24:19.400 --> 24:22.850
He put that mark on every one of his paintings.

24:24.350 --> 24:28.050
He had that shell in his hands on the day he died.

24:29.650 --> 24:31.100
How can you know that?

24:31.200 --> 24:32.900
I saw it.

24:32.990 --> 24:34.300
He showed me.

24:35.950 --> 24:37.500
Why are you doing this?

24:37.600 --> 24:40.150
I'm helping your father.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.750
He's trying to reach you through me.

24:42.850 --> 24:44.900
If I thought...

24:45.050 --> 24:47.500
there was a chance I could really...

24:48.850 --> 24:52.150
if I had one more chance to talk to my father...

24:55.550 --> 24:58.950
leslie,please,just trust me.

25:05.650 --> 25:07.650
You almost had me,lady.

25:09.450 --> 25:11.200
You are very cruel.

25:11.350 --> 25:13.250
Very cruel.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.450
Ooh,these are pretty?

25:35.550 --> 25:37.800
Yeah,and expensive.

25:40.450 --> 25:42.900
Is this a bad time,or should I come back?

25:42.950 --> 25:44.850
No,it's fine. Are you all right?

25:45.100 --> 25:47.150
I caught a couple of punks breaking into my van.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.350
I realized it's not safe to keep my father's painting there.

25:50.450 --> 25:52.750
Maybe you could hold on to it for me.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.250
Of course. We'd be honored.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.600
I'll put it in a safe place.

26:01.650 --> 26:04.000
It's just until I get myself squared away.

26:04.700 --> 26:06.750
There's a job at the art institute.

26:06.850 --> 26:08.350
Just cleaning up and stuff.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.400
But they might give me a room.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.000
Is that all?

26:14.200 --> 26:16.100
Well,you know it's not.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.000
Can I see...

26:19.100 --> 26:21.500
will you show me that other painting again?

26:34.300 --> 26:35.650
It's his.

26:36.350 --> 26:38.250
I can feel it.

26:38.950 --> 26:41.150
Please tell me how you got this.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.950
I already did.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.250
I wanna believe,I swear.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.250
But I can't.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.550
If I did and it was a lie,I...

26:56.800 --> 26:59.050
I'd die. I'd just die.

26:59.950 --> 27:03.100
I can't have my heart broken again.

27:06.350 --> 27:07.550
You wanna take a walk?

27:08.450 --> 27:10.550
Rowe discovered my father.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.100
He lent him money and he took care of him.

27:13.150 --> 27:16.700
And then when he went to prison,he became a supplier.

27:16.750 --> 27:20.050
Brushes,paints,canvas,anything you needed.

27:20.350 --> 27:24.300
From then on,my dad thought he was a saint and totally trusted him.

27:24.350 --> 27:25.850
But you never did.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.850
Not even as a kid.

27:28.050 --> 27:31.800
Every time I saw my dad,rowe was always around.

27:32.250 --> 27:35.300
The last year he was alive,I only saw him 3 times.

27:35.550 --> 27:37.450
That must have been hard. You were so young.

27:37.550 --> 27:40.000
He was the one sitting in prison for something he didn't do,

27:40.050 --> 27:42.550
accused of murdering a man he didn't even know.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.850
Yeah,how did that happen?

27:43.900 --> 27:45.750
Well,they've only told me pieces of the story.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.550
I've had to fill in the blanks.

27:50.450 --> 27:54.150
My father was seeing this married woman.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.150
She said that her husband abused her

27:56.200 --> 27:58.750
and that she needed him to save her.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.600
But all she really wanted was to see her husband dead.

28:19.800 --> 28:21.600
She set my dad up.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.200
When the cops started asking questions,

28:26.250 --> 28:27.500
she accused my dad.

28:27.550 --> 28:30.450
He was arrested,and then he let rowe handle everything--

28:30.500 --> 28:31.750
the lawyers,the defense.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.500
What did rowe get out of it?

28:33.550 --> 28:35.200
All the paintings.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.250
My father signed everything over to him.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.900
For his defense,rowe said.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.350
And then when he died,

28:44.650 --> 28:46.100
rowe just took them all.

28:46.150 --> 28:48.150
He said he had a contract.

28:48.350 --> 28:51.650
All I got was the one painting he gave me from prison.

28:52.500 --> 28:55.550
Well,there's got to be some legal steps,something.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.600
I'm sure there is. But it takes money and years.

29:01.600 --> 29:03.000
I hope you appreciate the fact

29:03.050 --> 29:04.350
that I don't have to do this,miss gordon.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.300
Then why are you?

29:05.350 --> 29:07.050
Because clete was a friend.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.950
And even though leslie's clearly damaged,

29:09.000 --> 29:11.100
I'd like her to have some peace of mind about clete's intentions.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.550
How can leslie end up with only one painting?

29:13.650 --> 29:15.800
I never made any claims on the self-portrait

29:15.850 --> 29:17.300
although I had every right to do that.

29:17.350 --> 29:19.350
You are a piece of work,mr. Rowe.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.650
Hey,don't patronize me,miss gordon.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.900
You don't know anything about my relationship with clete youngblood.

29:23.950 --> 29:25.100
I made him.

29:25.150 --> 29:28.150
And given his self-destructive tendencies,that was no easy task.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
Now,what I couldn't do was take the gun out of his hands

29:30.250 --> 29:31.500
the night he killed someone.

29:31.550 --> 29:33.000
Maybe that's what leslie has against me.

29:33.050 --> 29:34.900
She says he's innocent.

29:35.200 --> 29:36.650
Yeah,she does.

29:37.750 --> 29:39.100
What about the paintings,rowe?

29:39.200 --> 29:40.100
Where are you sending them?

29:40.150 --> 29:42.600
To a gallery in Munich.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.450
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.550
Is this your father's signature?

29:47.150 --> 29:48.850
I guess so.

29:49.300 --> 29:52.650
Leslie,your father had a quality that you sorely lack.

29:52.700 --> 29:54.200
Gratitude.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.700
You son of a bitch.

29:55.750 --> 29:57.900
You may have had my father fooled,but not me.

29:57.950 --> 29:59.800
-Not for a second. -Come on.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.650
Not like that. Come on.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.350
I'm not a lawyer,but the contract seemed real.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.150
Look,there's no use trying to figure this out.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.600
People like rowe,they're powerful.

30:15.650 --> 30:17.400
When they line up against you,there's nothing you can do.

30:17.450 --> 30:18.750
Just look at what happened to my dad.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.850
An innocent man hanged.

30:33.650 --> 30:35.650
-He's here. -Where?

30:37.050 --> 30:39.100
What? What is it?

30:39.200 --> 30:42.700
Tell her...I'm sorry...

30:42.850 --> 30:43.900
for everything.

30:43.950 --> 30:45.100
Dad?

30:50.400 --> 30:52.000
Look in the back.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.300
The back.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.400
What? What happened? Was he here?

30:59.450 --> 31:01.400
Yes. And he said that he's sorry--

31:01.450 --> 31:02.600
sorry for everything.

31:02.650 --> 31:04.650
And then he said look in the back.

31:04.950 --> 31:06.000
The back?

31:06.100 --> 31:07.650
The back of what?

31:20.000 --> 31:21.600
It's a double canvas.

31:21.700 --> 31:23.500
Well,maybe there's something in between.

31:23.550 --> 31:24.900
We'll have to cut it open.

31:24.950 --> 31:27.050
The painting could be destroyed.

31:27.300 --> 31:29.850
Your father needs us to see inside.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.950
When you called,I assumed you meant an x ray of the human variety.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.050
I assumed if I told you it was of the valuable painting variety,

31:41.100 --> 31:42.100
you would've said no.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.150
Good assumption.

31:43.200 --> 31:44.900
You better get behind the shield.

31:44.950 --> 31:47.800
Why do I feel like I'm suddenly in a steve mcqueen movie?

32:05.250 --> 32:06.850
That your husband?

32:09.300 --> 32:12.800
He's a good man.  A righteous man.

32:12.900 --> 32:15.850
You tell him that brenda reese is a liar.

32:15.950 --> 32:18.100
She's no more hurt than I am.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.100
Her husband's putting her up to it.

32:20.150 --> 32:22.800
I heard 'em talking about it when he came to take her home.

32:22.900 --> 32:25.100
I'd tell him myself,but I don't want them

32:25.150 --> 32:27.500
to find me out here in this hallway.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.900
They think an old lady can't get around on her own.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.500
I understand.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.250
I'll tell him.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.150
Thanks.

32:41.650 --> 32:43.100
Something's definitely back there.

32:43.150 --> 32:43.950
Looks like it.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.350
-Now what? -We operate.

33:40.900 --> 33:42.350
It's the same contract rowe has.

33:42.400 --> 33:49.000
Except this one says that you own 85% of every sale of your father's paintings.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.450
Now I know what he meant.

34:00.150 --> 34:02.200
I was visiting my father in prison.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.850
I didn't know then,

34:04.300 --> 34:06.500
but they were gonna hang him that night.

34:06.650 --> 34:08.699
He knew he was never gonna see me again.

34:08.750 --> 34:10.550
Don't look so scared.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.750
Everything's gonna be fine.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.350
I made this for you.

34:23.500 --> 34:26.900
Only...you.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.449
Always remember how much fun we had painting together.

34:31.550 --> 34:34.250
You're gonna have to be a big girl now,honey.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.550
And remember one more thing.

34:45.100 --> 34:48.449
Everything you need...

34:49.199 --> 34:50.949
is in this painting.

34:53.949 --> 34:55.900
It's all yours.

34:57.600 --> 34:59.450
And always remember...

34:59.500 --> 35:01.750
how much your daddy loves you.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.450
Why are you crying,daddy?

35:34.350 --> 35:36.550
He never trusted rowe either.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.900
Why else would he hide the contract in the painting?

35:39.950 --> 35:44.100
Leslie,your life is about to change.

35:46.500 --> 35:47.950
Wait a minute. Wait.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.550
Isn't rowe about to sell the paintings?

35:51.450 --> 35:53.400
Like hell he is.

35:56.250 --> 35:58.250
Hey,take a break,fellas.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.950
It's not going anywhere yet.

36:04.750 --> 36:06.450
You cheated me and you cheated my father.

36:06.500 --> 36:08.000
Take me to court then,leslie.

36:08.050 --> 36:11.950
See if a jury buys a contract between a murderer and an 8-year-old.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.500
It'll take years and every penny you've got.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.850
Can you wait that long?

36:16.000 --> 36:18.300
Can you outspend me?

36:18.450 --> 36:20.200
I don't think so.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.300
This paper means nothing.

36:44.200 --> 36:46.800
Tell him to give my daughter what is hers.

36:46.850 --> 36:49.150
He wants his daughter to have those paintings.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.300
It's the only thing he's ever wanted.

36:54.950 --> 36:58.400
Clete youngblood is dead,and those paintings are mine.

37:05.050 --> 37:06.150
Mr. Rowe,

37:06.450 --> 37:09.200
unless you wanna spend every day of your life being hanged

37:09.250 --> 37:12.200
over and over again,I suggest you do the right thing here.

37:12.250 --> 37:14.300
No,no,no.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.600
Enough.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.300
Does leslie get the paintings?

37:18.450 --> 37:21.000
Yes. Yes,she can have the paintings.

37:21.050 --> 37:21.800
Take 'em. Burn 'em for all I care.

37:21.850 --> 37:22.700
Just get out of here.

37:22.750 --> 37:25.100
Get out! Now!

37:25.550 --> 37:27.450
Get out of here!

38:15.000 --> 38:16.200
We always get our man.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.400
Yeah,that was beautiful.

38:17.450 --> 38:19.150
-Thanks so much. -Hey,no problem.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.800
I never had more fun following an old lady around for a week.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.750
But how did you know she was faking?

38:24.800 --> 38:26.550
Well,you know,melinda just had A...

38:26.800 --> 38:27.850
had what?

38:29.550 --> 38:32.100
Let's say she had a hunch. Lunch is on me. Come on.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.500
...it is part...

38:34.550 --> 38:37.250
got...

38:38.150 --> 38:41.000
Well,I love what you haven't done to the place.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.550
So how does it feel to have your own gallery?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.750
Oh,it feels good.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.200
I think my dad would be proud.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.550
Tell her she did a good job.

38:55.350 --> 38:56.500
He's here.

38:56.650 --> 38:58.150
And he's really happy.

38:59.550 --> 39:00.850
Dad.

39:01.000 --> 39:05.100
Tell her I'm sorry ...for everything.

39:05.700 --> 39:08.100
He wants you to know that he's really sorry--

39:08.150 --> 39:09.250
no,no,no,no.

39:09.300 --> 39:12.250
You don't have to be sorry for anything.

39:12.300 --> 39:16.000
I'm going to fight for you and clear your name.

39:16.750 --> 39:18.950
Tell her I don't want her to clear my name.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.350
She can't clear my name.

39:23.050 --> 39:24.850
I'm a murderer.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.800
I wanted to get her away from that bastard.

39:56.950 --> 39:58.500
It was stupid.

39:59.000 --> 40:00.750
It was crazy.

40:02.550 --> 40:04.100
But I did it.

40:07.150 --> 40:08.650
He killed him.

40:09.350 --> 40:11.400
Leslie,he was guilty.

40:11.450 --> 40:13.050
No,daddy.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.450
You couldn't have.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.550
She has to stop being so angry.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.550
I ruined my life.

40:22.350 --> 40:24.350
No one else's fault but mine.

40:25.350 --> 40:27.850
He doesn't want you to blame anybody else.

40:28.750 --> 40:31.100
If I had realized what it would cost me--

40:31.250 --> 40:33.400
that I would lose you,

40:33.500 --> 40:34.550
lose everything.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.150
What is he saying?

40:38.650 --> 40:41.550
he's saying that if he could do it all again,he would just...

40:41.650 --> 40:43.300
take you away.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.300
Just the two of you.

40:45.350 --> 40:49.850
Somewhere where he could just paint all day and nothing else.

40:49.950 --> 40:51.650
I remember,dad.

40:53.300 --> 40:57.750
I remember sitting on your lap watching you paint,

40:57.850 --> 41:00.200
moving the colors around.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.400
I remember. Dad,I remember.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.450
I remember,too.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.000
He remembers.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.650
I see something.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.450
A light.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.250
I'm scared.

41:31.300 --> 41:32.850
It's ok.

41:33.250 --> 41:35.550
It's just your next step.

41:38.200 --> 41:40.100
He's gonna cross over now.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.850
No. Daddy,please don't go.

41:42.950 --> 41:45.000
I've lived so long without you.

41:45.050 --> 41:47.650
I'll always find a way to watch over her.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.750
She'll always feel me there.

41:51.650 --> 41:53.250
Tell her...

41:53.650 --> 41:55.950
not to remember the man I was...

41:56.850 --> 41:59.850
but the man that she wanted me to be.

42:00.800 --> 42:02.150
I will.

42:02.900 --> 42:05.000
I love you,daddy.

42:09.300 --> 42:11.000
Good-bye,baby.

42:14.250 --> 42:15.350
Thank you.

42:22.850 --> 42:24.750
He's gone.

42:30.850 --> 42:33.350
I don't feel alone anymore.

42:35.850 --> 42:37.400
You're not.

42:39.200 --> 42:41.000
Guys,we have got to get that door open.

42:41.050 --> 42:43.350
There's like 40 people waiting out there.

42:43.450 --> 42:45.500
-Ok,you ready? -I'm ready.

42:45.550 --> 42:46.800
Let 'em in.
