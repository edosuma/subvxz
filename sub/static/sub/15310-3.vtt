WEBVTT

00:01.969 --> 00:03.371
This wine is amazing.

00:03.404 --> 00:04.838
You were totally right.
Oh.

00:04.872 --> 00:07.075
How do you know
so much about wine?

00:07.108 --> 00:09.543
Well, I spent ten years
in an unhappy marriage.

00:09.577 --> 00:12.313
That'll make a wine expert
out of anybody.
Ooh.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.483
I want to get divorced.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.019
And that's when it happened.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.455
She touched your balls?

00:23.191 --> 00:24.392
That is the greatest
first date story

00:24.425 --> 00:26.994
I have ever heard
in my entire life.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.229
Not counting, of course,

00:28.262 --> 00:29.697
going to the movies
with your parents.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.465
'Cause that was magical.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.602
Wait, so this Annika girl
just reached out

00:34.635 --> 00:36.170
and grabbed your nuts?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.472
I wouldn't say grabbed.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.273
It was more like a...

00:39.307 --> 00:41.209
a graze, you know, a nudge.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.910
Well, was it a graze or a nudge?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.545
Because there's
a very big difference.

00:44.578 --> 00:45.746
Mm-hmm.

00:45.779 --> 00:46.947
A nudge implies intent,

00:46.980 --> 00:49.817
whereas a graze...
purely accidental.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.219
It's tough to tell down there.

00:51.252 --> 00:53.554
Every touch feels
like something special.

00:54.655 --> 00:55.923
Graze, a nudge.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.326
I'd just be happy if
somebody looked at it.

01:02.763 --> 01:05.433
Happy now?

01:19.547 --> 01:23.083
Well, it's official--
I'm screwed.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.852
The Gyno Tennis Classic
starts tomorrow.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.655
And thanks to Will's "tennis
elbow," I have no partner.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.957
Hey, don't use air quotes.
That's a real thing.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.425
I overexerted my elbow.

01:31.459 --> 01:35.196
Yeah, by overexerting
my Female Fitness magazine.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.434
Honey, you could be his partner.
Lowell used to play as a kid.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.436
Oh, yeah, but I'm not
a gynecologist.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.373
Although I am
a vagina enthusiast.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.608
See, both guys don't need
to be an OB.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.443
You'd be doing me
a huge favor, Lowell.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.879
Oh, Bob, you know
I can't say no to you.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.114
Of course I'm in!
Nice.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.784
Ooh, it's from Annika.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.219
"Thanks for the drink.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.487
I had a lovely evening."

01:59.520 --> 02:00.754
Aw.
Now, that

02:00.788 --> 02:01.955
is a class act.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.395
And that is a picture
of a vagina.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.598
Who-ah, that's a hoo-ha!

02:10.631 --> 02:13.100
Close up, fully shaved.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.203
Imagination not required.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.739
Look at that, it looks
like it's winking at you.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.942
Will, if you really
like this girl,

02:21.975 --> 02:23.444
there's only one way to respond.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.045
Penis pic.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.447
Oh, come on,
don't be ridiculous.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.682
This is Will;
he'd never do that.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.852
Yeah, seriously,
he's so not that guy.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.454
How do you know
I'm not that guy?

02:33.487 --> 02:35.889
I've been with
the same woman for 12 years.

02:35.923 --> 02:38.492
We don't know who I am
as a single, dating person.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.960
Yes, we do.
You're the guy who asks

02:39.993 --> 02:41.529
the girl out
for a root beer float,

02:41.562 --> 02:43.231
and then makes an oopsy
in his boxers

02:43.264 --> 02:44.698
'cause he can't get her girdle

02:44.732 --> 02:47.401
off fast enough.

02:47.435 --> 02:48.769
You are totally wrong about me.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.238
I can be wild.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.139
I could be adventurous.
I could be cool.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.207
No, you can't.

02:53.241 --> 02:54.442
Watch me.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.644
I'm gonna go
photograph my privates.

03:15.796 --> 03:16.730
No.

03:16.764 --> 03:17.865
No.
Don't you think?

03:24.638 --> 03:26.907
All right.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.041
No pressure.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.410
Just keep the ball in play.
Okay.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.812
Um, just to warn you,
when it comes to tennis,

03:31.845 --> 03:33.146
I can get a little excitable.

03:33.180 --> 03:34.982
That's fine,
just have fun, okay?
Okay.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.650
Here we go.

03:36.684 --> 03:37.418
All right.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.553
Good luck.
Good luck.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.226
Ace! In your face!

03:46.260 --> 03:48.195
You like my balls, old man?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.464
Because you're gonna be
choking on them all day!

03:50.498 --> 03:52.099
Hey, thanks for the invite, Bob.

03:52.132 --> 03:53.334
I'm gonna burn
your houses to the ground

03:53.367 --> 03:55.303
and eat your children!

03:57.338 --> 04:00.508
This is a lovely facility.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.546
It is a tournament for
men who deliver babies

04:05.579 --> 04:08.982
and one man who
threatens to eat them.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.584
Lowell's
the greatest partner ever.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.653
Hmm, you should try
having sex with him.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.122
Well, let's see how
the tournament goes first.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.928
Oh, Kate, hi.
We weren't expecting you.

04:20.961 --> 04:21.995
Uh-huh, I know.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.331
What'd you do for lunch today?

04:23.364 --> 04:25.366
Oh, I didn't even have
a chance to eat.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.134
I had to take Charlie
to the pediatrician.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.336
He, um...

04:28.369 --> 04:30.338
He needed his shots.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.639
What shots did he get?

04:31.672 --> 04:34.308
Uh, measles, whooping cough,
Rubella.

04:34.342 --> 04:35.976
Wow, and what about you, Jules?

04:36.009 --> 04:38.646
I've already had all my shots.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.848
You guys,
I saw you having lunch today.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.215
And you declined my call!

04:42.249 --> 04:43.717
Oh...

04:43.751 --> 04:45.619
Don't exchange a look!
Just tell me what's going on!

04:45.653 --> 04:48.989
Okay, the truth is, we were
planning Jules' wedding,

04:49.022 --> 04:52.025
and we just didn't think
that you'd...
You'd be into that.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.895
And why wouldn't I be
into planning Jules' wedding?

04:54.928 --> 04:57.798
Uh...

04:57.831 --> 05:00.934
We just didn't think you'd like
talking about wedding stuff.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.436
Why? Because I'm single?

05:02.470 --> 05:05.072
Because you pity me
and think I'm gonna die alone?

05:05.105 --> 05:07.741
No...
Not for a very long time.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.076
No.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.480
Look, a lot
of little girls dream

05:12.513 --> 05:13.881
about their wedding.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.384
I dreamt of becoming
a successful businesswoman.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.818
And I have.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.754
Success has asked me
to marry him and I said yes.

05:20.788 --> 05:24.758
And now we're raising
a beautiful 401K together.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.628
So you don't have
to worry about me.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.997
Well, in that case, will you
make us the happiest girls

05:30.030 --> 05:32.766
in the world and join us for
a planning lunch tomorrow?

05:32.800 --> 05:35.369
Yes, and I'm paying
for all of it.

05:35.403 --> 05:36.670
The lunch, not the wedding.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.507
I'm generous, not an idiot.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.109
Well, the picture has been sent.

05:42.142 --> 05:45.345
Bam, done, drop the mic,
walk away.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.448
Nice, man.
Excellent.
Congratulations.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.716
Surprised and delighted.
Right?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.183
I think I struck
the perfect balance, too.

05:50.217 --> 05:53.320
Cool, casual, relaxed.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.723
Wait, how relaxed were you?

05:55.756 --> 05:57.124
Fully relaxed.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.961
Why?

06:00.994 --> 06:02.396
Oh, my God.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.397
Oh, Will.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.534
What? I didn't want
to seem overeager.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.636
Did you want to seem impotent?

06:08.669 --> 06:10.037
Why didn't you say something?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.705
We didn't think we'd have
to tell a grown man

06:11.739 --> 06:14.341
not to photograph
his flaccid penis.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.745
There's only one thing to do.
You got to take it again.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.946
And this time

06:18.979 --> 06:20.681
you got to get a little
more skin in the game.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.417
Or you could give up
and admit you're not that guy.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.152
No, I am that guy.
That guy is this guy.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.154
I'm just working out
some of the kinks.
All right, good luck.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.956
If you need a little help,
there's a new Female Fitness

06:28.989 --> 06:30.724
in the guest bathroom.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.534
Okay, so fill me in.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.869
What kind of wedding
are we having?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.170
Okay, well, Lowell and I
both love the ocean.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.371
So we were thinking
a beach wedding.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.405
Malibu.

06:45.439 --> 06:46.874
Love it. When are you thinking?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.041
This summer.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.076
So, you have all your permits?

06:49.109 --> 06:51.278
We need permits?

06:51.311 --> 06:53.013
Well, didn't your caterer
tell you that?

06:54.247 --> 06:55.983
You don't have a caterer?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.284
Well, at least tell me

06:57.317 --> 06:58.552
you've petitioned the city
for temporary

06:58.586 --> 07:00.521
two-way access
for your deliveries.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.690
We-we haven't exactly

07:02.723 --> 07:04.725
locked down all the details yet.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.359
All these lunches
and you haven't

07:06.393 --> 07:08.128
figured out a single thing?

07:08.161 --> 07:09.630
Hey, no, we figured out a lot.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.633
We know that we don't want
lame bridesmaids dresses.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.503
Or rain.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.105
And I want to wear my hair up.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.674
Unless it looks better down.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.042
Right, but that's it?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.310
That's all you've done?

07:23.343 --> 07:25.746
Well, we've been busy
eating focaccia.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.549
And worrying
that you'd catch us.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.519
Maybe we could use some help.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.820
Yeah, ironic
that you didn't include me,

07:32.853 --> 07:35.723
and now you're begging
for my help.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.390
Hey, I wouldn't exactly
say I'm begging...

07:37.424 --> 07:38.759
Stop, you're
embarrassing yourself.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.762
I'll do it.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.332
Yes!
Come on!

07:45.365 --> 07:47.200
We are going to the finals!

07:48.536 --> 07:49.737
Yes! You are awesome.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.572
I am so glad Will has
masturbation elbow.

07:51.605 --> 07:53.140
I know. Me, too, right?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.575
And I've been waiting for
the right time to bring this up.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.209
I got a name for us.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.377
The Racketeers.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.345
I like it.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.080
He likes it.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.782
Good game, boys.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.050
Good game.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.752
Hey, I really want to apologize
for what I said before.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.588
I'm sure your mom is lovely
and would never consent to that.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.623
Good game.
Tough break.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.959
See you next year.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.629
Hey, McAllister.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.730
Looks like we're gonna be

08:16.764 --> 08:18.532
going up against you
in the finals.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.701
Lowell, Dr. Gunderson,

08:20.734 --> 08:21.835
Dr. Adelman, they chair

08:21.869 --> 08:23.303
the obstetrics board
at the hospital.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.372
And we are the
undefeated champions.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.307
For 12 years,
our office has been

08:27.340 --> 08:28.909
home to that
magnificent trophy.

08:28.942 --> 08:32.145
You can't imagine what it's like
to cradle the Golden Vulva.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.247
It's heavier than it looks.

08:34.281 --> 08:36.617
Oh, well, with any luck,

08:36.650 --> 08:38.719
Bobby and I'll be
taking it home tomorrow.

08:38.752 --> 08:41.288
Well, we wish you good luck.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.456
You know you can't
actually win, right?

08:43.490 --> 08:44.925
Well, listen, not
to sound cocky,

08:44.958 --> 08:47.527
but, um, I like our
chances this year.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.862
Well, I-I guess it's possible.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.864
Anything is possible.
You might win.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.600
Tell him what else
is possible, Abe.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.002
Well, it's possible you could
end up doing deliveries

08:55.035 --> 08:58.471
in O.R. 6 with the bad
lighting and the weird smell.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.507
Or we could move your locker

09:00.540 --> 09:02.109
over by the medical waste chute.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.343
Or maybe-- just maybe--

09:03.376 --> 09:07.247
your parking would
be shifted to P2.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.516
Whoa, what are you saying?

09:09.549 --> 09:10.851
that if we don't
throw this game,

09:10.884 --> 09:12.620
you're gonna mess with
me at the hospital?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, no.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.322
We did not say that.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.489
Those are your words.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.892
But yes, yes,
that's it exactly.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.333
Okay, so we're agreed.
Blush and pewter.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.401
I'm checking off
the color scheme.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.837
Wow, this is more

09:29.870 --> 09:32.272
than I've gotten done
in one day in my entire life.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.341
I mean, for someone who never
dreamed about their wedding,

09:34.374 --> 09:35.743
you are really good at this.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.646
Well, I'm good at
everything, so...

09:38.679 --> 09:40.580
Well, it-it-it was impressive

09:40.614 --> 09:42.415
and everything,
but you chose a restaurant

09:42.449 --> 09:44.918
that doesn't serve focaccia,
and that's just something

09:44.952 --> 09:48.255
that we look forward to
in every meeting.

09:48.288 --> 09:50.257
Ah, Kate, Jules, Andi.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.992
This is Annika.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.194
Oh, hi.
Hi.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.797
Hey, it's nice to meet you guys.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.437
Order me a salad?
I'm gonna run to the restroom.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.505
All right.

10:05.538 --> 10:06.874
You know, it's weird.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.441
I don't know her last name,

10:08.475 --> 10:11.244
and yet I've seen her vagina.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.182
So I take it she liked
the second photo?

10:15.215 --> 10:16.984
Oh, yeah.
Well, once she saw the before,

10:17.017 --> 10:19.820
she was that much more impressed
with the after.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.222
It told a story.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.658
Oh.
Wow, Will.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.059
I am impressed.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.128
Got to say, didn't think
you would pull this one off.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.663
That's because
you underestimate me.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.932
And lo and behold,
I proved you wrong.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.634
Let me take a picture
of you being wrong.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.071
Hello, this year's
Christmas card.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.809
Did you know
this place was vegan?

10:41.842 --> 10:44.244
Yeah. I figured we'd try
something light and refreshing.

10:44.277 --> 10:45.713
I'm not really
that hungry.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.015
Maybe we should just go back
to my place and have sex.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.585
Sex is light and refreshing.

10:52.619 --> 10:54.988
Not the way I do it.

11:00.227 --> 11:03.230
Okay.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.633
Good shot, good shot.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.035
I know it's hard for you,

11:08.068 --> 11:09.970
but I really appreciate
you losing for me.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.038
It's okay.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.439
My serve!

11:12.472 --> 11:14.274
Hey, I see a glimmer
of hope

11:14.307 --> 11:16.076
in your eye,
Dr. McAllister,

11:16.109 --> 11:19.212
and I'm gonna kill it
like a particularly
nasty yeast infection.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.915
That's a good one,
Dr. Gunderson.

11:21.949 --> 11:25.618
Tell him your put-down, Abe.
Tell him your put-down.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.087
Well, I was just telling
Ed here

11:27.120 --> 11:29.556
that your game reminds me
of a case of trichomoniasis

11:29.589 --> 11:31.324
in an otherwise
healthy vagina.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.327
I had to agree!
It's true!

11:34.361 --> 11:38.799
You guys are both hilarious
and a pleasure to park near.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.203
Seriously?

11:50.577 --> 11:52.345
Ah!

11:52.379 --> 11:53.781
You're so hot.

11:53.814 --> 11:56.449
Mmm, so are you.
You want to get dirty?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.518
Yes, I do.

11:59.820 --> 12:00.988
I want to do stuff
to you.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.823
Oh, really?
What kind of stuff?

12:02.856 --> 12:04.758
Uh, dirty stuff.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.226
Like what?

12:06.259 --> 12:09.329
Uh, my stuff's too dirty.
You go first.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.432
How about this?

12:13.566 --> 12:14.567
Son of a...!

12:14.601 --> 12:17.170
I... love it!

12:17.204 --> 12:19.272
Really, huh?

12:19.306 --> 12:20.507
Yeah, yeah.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.575
But I also like
being denied pleasure,

12:22.609 --> 12:24.611
so, uh, don't do that again.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.346
Ooh... kinky.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.547
Do you ever use

12:27.580 --> 12:29.883
props in the bedroom?

12:29.917 --> 12:32.085
Sometimes I use
a lumbar pillow.

12:32.119 --> 12:36.123
Get naked and get on the bed.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.596
Ooh!

12:43.630 --> 12:46.133
Come on, Will, you got this.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.868
You got this. You're that guy.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.103
Are you allergic
to any sedatives?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.106
Wha-What?

12:53.140 --> 12:57.277
It's okay.
I took 'em all anyway.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.948
Okay, now get undressed
and grab onto those bedposts.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.682
I'm gonna tie you down.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.885
Awesome.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.387
People know where I am.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.321
What?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.890
Nothing.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.862
Okay, item 43 on
today's agenda: jazz band.

13:14.895 --> 13:16.830
I don't really think
we need a jazz band.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.331
Okay, let's compromise
on the jazz band

13:18.365 --> 13:21.134
and just go with the
jazz band. Moving on.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.237
It's just that it feels a little
formal for a beach wedding,

13:24.271 --> 13:26.806
but as long as we those
wildflower centerpieces,

13:26.840 --> 13:28.108
I'm okay with it.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.211
Yeah, animals pee
on wildflowers, so, no.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.546
She's doing it again.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.515
Totally.
What?
What am I doing?

13:35.548 --> 13:38.085
It's just that everything
always has to be your way.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.820
For instance, you didn't need
to discontinue the focaccia.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.222
I mean, look,

13:42.255 --> 13:44.958
Andi and I may
not have been getting
a lot done,

13:44.992 --> 13:46.626
but at least
we were having fun.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.128
This isn't fun.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.065
This is a wedding;
it's not supposed
to be fun!

13:53.066 --> 13:55.035
I just feel like
with you in charge,

13:55.068 --> 13:57.804
there's no way I'm going
to get what I want, okay?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.739
Maybe we don't need
your help after all.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.242
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.878
You're firing me?

14:04.912 --> 14:07.680
Well, technically,
I never actually ever hired you.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.216
You just kind of took over.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.118
Okay, in that case,
I quit!

14:11.151 --> 14:13.386
Can't wait to come
to your wedding in 2087

14:13.420 --> 14:15.923
when Malibu is under six feet
of water

14:15.956 --> 14:18.291
and we have a robot president!

14:19.492 --> 14:24.497
I'd chase after her, but
it's-it's physically impossible.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.400
Now I feel bad.
Do you think
she'll be okay?

14:27.434 --> 14:28.535
Oh, she'll be fine.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.938
Now let's go to a restaurant
that serves focaccia

14:30.971 --> 14:33.340
and just get back into it.
Okay.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.444
Oh, my gosh, this bridal
magazine is addressed to Kate.

14:37.477 --> 14:38.912
She has a subscription?

14:38.946 --> 14:42.515
She is the little girl
who dreams of her wedding.

14:42.549 --> 14:47.354
Oh, my God, we just crushed
a little girl's dreams.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.490
And yet I still want focaccia.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.074
This is nice.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.876
Christmas has always
been my favorite holiday.

15:09.909 --> 15:14.181
I've been a naughty little girl.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.916
And you're Santa
and you've just locked up

15:16.950 --> 15:18.551
the department store
for the night.

15:18.585 --> 15:22.022
Wait-- am I Santa or am I the
manager of the department store?

15:22.055 --> 15:24.091
Shut up, slave!

15:27.627 --> 15:30.030
Oh, my God, Mr. Jojo,

15:30.063 --> 15:32.599
get away
from the window!

15:32.632 --> 15:33.967
Oh, no!

15:34.001 --> 15:37.237
Oh! Mr. Jojo is an indoor cat!

15:37.270 --> 15:38.638
Why did you open the window?!

15:38.671 --> 15:41.841
That's what requires
an explanation right now?

15:41.874 --> 15:44.144
I'll be back.
Don't go anywhere.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.546
I'd prefer if you
didn't go anywhere!

15:46.579 --> 15:49.616
And yet, there you go.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.760
Nice play, McAllister.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.362
Your game is

16:02.395 --> 16:05.798
wearing thin like the uterine
lining of a menopausal woman!

16:05.832 --> 16:08.168
Yeah, that's thin!

16:08.201 --> 16:09.469
Hey, Olivia Newton-John,

16:09.502 --> 16:12.205
my dingo's gonna eat your baby.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.474
That's not really
funny to us.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.443
You know, I should
take it easy on this guy.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.611
He's not even a doctor.
He works in a restaurant.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.347
Hey, he owns
a restaurant.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.416
And it happens to be one
that I'm starting to tolerate.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.052
I bet he didn't even go
to college!

16:25.085 --> 16:26.553
Okay, you know what?
That's enough!

16:26.586 --> 16:29.589
Hey! You don't tell Dr.
Gunderson when it's enough.

16:29.622 --> 16:31.791
Dr. Gunderson tells you
when it's enough!

16:31.824 --> 16:34.261
Bob, Bob, it's fine, and it's
actually true, I didn't.

16:34.294 --> 16:36.163
So let's just
lose and go home.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.631
No. You know what? New plan.
We play to win.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.866
Now hang on.
Is that wise?

16:39.899 --> 16:41.201
I mean, what about
the work stuff?

16:41.234 --> 16:42.569
And what about the
space for your car?

16:42.602 --> 16:43.870
What about the space
for our friendship?!

16:43.903 --> 16:45.338
We are mates,
aren't we?

16:45.372 --> 16:48.241
We're more than mates.
We're Racketeers.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.576
Whew!

16:49.609 --> 16:51.711
And if anybody's going home
with that trophy, it's us!

16:51.744 --> 16:53.046
Unleash the beast.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.882
This is the side of Bobby
I like to see. Yes!

16:55.915 --> 16:58.085
Have you two gentlemen
had lunch today?

16:58.985 --> 17:01.754
Because you're about
to eat my balls!

17:09.996 --> 17:12.399
Stack a couple of mil

17:14.567 --> 17:17.537
I got the qua,

17:26.713 --> 17:29.316
Mr., Mr. Jojo, you're back.

17:29.349 --> 17:33.286
Which means Annika's gonna be
looking for you forever.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.928
Call Bobby.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.363
Calling Mommy.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.598
No, no, not Mommy,
not Mommy, no!

17:45.632 --> 17:48.868
Will, so good to hear from you!
How are you?!

17:48.901 --> 17:51.438
Mom, I-I need you to call Bobby.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.673
Hold on. Your father's yelling
something.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.041
I can't hear a thing.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.210
Mom, I need you to focus
and call Bobby.

17:57.244 --> 18:00.079
Why don't you take this
treadmill back? We never use it.

18:00.113 --> 18:01.981
Hey, Willy.
It's your father.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.250
Hank, I'm talking!

18:03.283 --> 18:04.517
I have a Facebook
question.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.986
It says I should update
Internet Explorer.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.155
Do I need that?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.589
Dad, now is not the time.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.891
I need you to call Bobby
and tell him...

18:11.924 --> 18:13.560
Oh, sorry, son,
NCIS is starting.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.561
We'll call you back.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.962
No, don't hang up,
don't hang up! No!

18:15.995 --> 18:18.064
Da...

18:19.432 --> 18:21.768
This could not get any worse.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.572
What are you looking at?

18:26.273 --> 18:28.575
No, Mr. Jojo, no!

18:32.345 --> 18:35.448
Okay, open your eyes.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.950
What is this?

18:37.984 --> 18:40.620
Are we crashing
someone's wedding?

18:40.653 --> 18:43.122
Yes. Yours.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.024
Well, the one that
you'll eventually have.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.526
What?

18:46.559 --> 18:49.296
Yes, everything that you were
pushing on Jules:

18:49.329 --> 18:53.433
the city views, the jazz band,
the communal table,

18:53.466 --> 18:55.502
were really actually things
that you wanted.

18:55.535 --> 19:00.207
Oh, what in God's name
would make you think that?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.642
We know that you subscribe
to bridal magazines.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.978
Oh, okay.
So there's no denying it.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.514
That is unfortunate.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.516
No, it's not.
You're supposed to share

19:09.549 --> 19:12.084
your dreams
with your friends.

19:12.118 --> 19:17.190
Okay, fine, I'll share.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.926
I do want what you guys have,

19:19.959 --> 19:21.928
okay?

19:21.961 --> 19:24.597
Can I jump off this roof now?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.199
Kate, you're gonna have
a wedding.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.800
And it's gonna be
beautiful.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.237
Yeah, but I don't even have...

19:30.270 --> 19:31.804
I don't know if I'll ever...

19:31.838 --> 19:33.105
You will.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.775
So don't give up on it,
because we haven't.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.944
I love you guys.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.347
I can't believe

19:40.380 --> 19:42.682
you went to all this trouble
and spent all this money.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.253
Actually, we used
your credit card.

19:46.286 --> 19:47.954
It may not work
tomorrow.

19:47.987 --> 19:52.592
Please tell me I bought booze
for my fake wedding.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.836
God, what is she, a sailor?!
Who ties knots like this?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.873
Oh!

20:06.906 --> 20:09.276
Thank God!
I called you guys,

20:09.309 --> 20:12.044
like, 15 times. Doesn't anybody
check their messages?

20:12.078 --> 20:15.382
What... is... happening?

20:17.083 --> 20:19.118
It's called modern dating.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.454
And I hate it.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.423
Some of these lights
aren't working.
Hmm.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.625
I wonder which one
is the problem.
Yeah.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.360
Seriously?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.095
Well, look on
the bright side,

20:29.128 --> 20:31.163
now you've proven
that you're that guy.

20:31.197 --> 20:32.399
Thank you. And thank you

20:32.432 --> 20:35.802
for not humiliating me
by calling...

20:35.835 --> 20:37.504
Well, well, well.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.072
All right, how many you got?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.210
Looks like Christmas came early
this year.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.745
O come all ye faithful.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.947
Did you go down her chimney?
Did she go up your chimney?

20:47.980 --> 20:49.382
Where'd your
ho-ho-ho go?

20:49.416 --> 20:54.954
Look, it's Rudolph
the blue-balled reindeer. Six.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.456
You done?

20:56.489 --> 20:57.557
As soon as I get my Christmas
card, so get in there.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.926
What a great idea.
Wait a minute, hey.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.828
Guys, no, not...

21:01.861 --> 21:03.930
And smile.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.501
