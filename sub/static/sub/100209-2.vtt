LAINEY: The '90s
was the heyday
of teen romcoms,

00:04.938 --> 00:07.608
and the greatest of all
was She's All That,

00:07.675 --> 00:09.510
a classic tale
of the popular guy

00:09.577 --> 00:11.845
who bets he can turn a girl
from geek to chic.

00:11.912 --> 00:15.149
And as a teacher,
I had to check it out
to stay up with the kids.

00:15.216 --> 00:18.786
"May I present the new,
not improved,

00:18.852 --> 00:20.354
"but different...

00:20.421 --> 00:21.455
"Laney Boggs."

00:22.356 --> 00:24.858
* Swing, swing

00:24.925 --> 00:26.894
* Swing the spinning step

00:26.960 --> 00:28.396
* You wear those shoes

00:28.462 --> 00:29.797
* And I will
wear that dress... *

00:29.863 --> 00:31.532
I may have checked it out
more than once,

00:31.599 --> 00:33.367
but less than 19 times.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.635
Am I a bet?
LAINEY: "Am I a bet?"

00:34.702 --> 00:35.769
Am I a bet?
"Am I a bet?"

00:35.836 --> 00:37.638
"Am I a (BLEEP) bet?"

00:37.705 --> 00:39.373
Turns out watching it
over and over

00:39.440 --> 00:41.309
came in pretty handy
at school.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.211
Hey, bro,
check out Harriet.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.213
Does she know half that
Go-Gurt is on her face?

00:45.279 --> 00:46.847
With a new look
and the right guy
on her arm,

00:46.914 --> 00:48.916
she could be as popular
as any girl at this school.

00:48.982 --> 00:50.284
I'll make that bet.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.819
Hey! You stop doing
what you're doing.
What?

00:51.885 --> 00:53.754
You're plotting
to She's-All-That
the weird girl.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.055
Um, I don't think
you're supposed

00:55.123 --> 00:56.124
to call the students
"weird."

00:56.190 --> 00:57.491
Look, it works out
in the movies.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.093
But in real life,
it is just wrong.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.561
And, uh, what makes
you the expert?

01:00.628 --> 01:01.929
Years before
the movie ever existed,

01:01.995 --> 01:03.797
I made a bet that
I could She's-All-That a guy

01:03.864 --> 01:05.133
right here
at William Penn.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.834
Whoa.
His name
was Barry Goldberg.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.035
He was emotionally
out of control.

01:09.637 --> 01:10.904
He rapped the most
un-fresh lyrics.

01:10.971 --> 01:12.140
(RAPPING) * Big Tasty
wants to take you

01:12.206 --> 01:13.641
* On a boat ride *

01:13.707 --> 01:15.276
He ran with his arms
flowing behind him.

01:15.343 --> 01:16.944
(GRUNTS)
This isn't fair!

01:17.010 --> 01:18.146
What happened?

01:18.212 --> 01:20.281
Before he finished
high school,
we were engaged.

01:20.348 --> 01:21.415
I don't want
to get engaged.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.650
When you
She's-All-That someone,

01:22.716 --> 01:24.485
there is no telling
what could happen.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.121
Take a long look at that
Go-Gurt-slurping weirdo.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.822
You really want to spend
the rest of your life
with her?

01:30.491 --> 01:31.492
Wazzup?

01:33.227 --> 01:34.428
You got something
on your chin?

01:34.495 --> 01:35.529
Oh, I do?
Yeah.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.597
It's to the left,
on your cheek.

01:38.098 --> 01:42.936
* Someday, you will say,
"Those were the days" *

01:43.003 --> 01:45.473
LAINEY: I t was January 16th,
1990-something,

01:45.539 --> 01:47.208
and I still had a lot
to learn in my new job,

01:47.275 --> 01:48.309
but the one thing I knew

01:48.376 --> 01:49.577
was every school
in the world

01:49.643 --> 01:51.145
had exactly
the same kind of teachers,

01:51.212 --> 01:52.713
like Ms. Cinoman,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.448
the classic
overly dramatic
drama teacher...

01:54.515 --> 01:56.049
Your soul, your breath,

01:56.116 --> 01:59.953

for Juliet!

02:00.020 --> 02:02.190
I need a minute.
I've worked myself up again.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.591
LAINEY: ...and Mr. Crosby,

02:03.657 --> 02:05.626
the intense eight-fingered
wood shop teacher...

02:05.693 --> 02:07.228
These nubs are a reminder

02:07.295 --> 02:09.897
of just how dangerous
wood shop can be.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.565
LAINEY: ...and then
there was CB,

02:11.632 --> 02:12.866
the young, hip,

02:12.933 --> 02:14.001
"super teacher"
that all the kids loved.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.135
Whoo!

02:15.203 --> 02:16.204
(BOTH VOACALIZE)

02:16.270 --> 02:17.505
What are you doing?

02:17.571 --> 02:19.240
I have a unique handshake
with each of the kids.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.574
Makes them feel special,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.343
and makes me feel...

02:22.410 --> 02:23.577
And makes...

02:25.045 --> 02:26.980
Okay, let's learn.

02:27.047 --> 02:28.749
LAINEY: And so far,
I was the newbie

02:28.816 --> 02:30.351
none of the other
teachers respected.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.419
Hey, Susan.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.753
I saw you still
need some help

02:32.820 --> 02:33.887
with
the Beautification Club.

02:33.954 --> 02:34.988
Sign me up.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.190
Wow.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.925
Well, manis and pedis
courtesy of the PTA?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.927
I mean, who wouldn't
jump on that?
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.230
The Beautification Club
spends every Saturday

02:42.296 --> 02:43.431
cleaning up
the local parks.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.532
Ew.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.200
I mean,
my weekend is jammed.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.735
More dirty needles
for Susan.

02:47.801 --> 02:48.869
I could help you, Susan.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.504
Oh, thanks, CB,
you're the best.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.607
(MOCKINGLY MIMICS CB)

02:53.674 --> 02:55.443
LAINEY: But I knew
if they just got
to know me,

02:55.509 --> 02:56.877
I could change all that.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.078
It wasn't easy.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.447
Hey, who wants
to go to the cafe

02:59.513 --> 03:00.914
and grab
some fish sticks?

03:00.981 --> 03:02.883
Pretty sweet that teachers
eat for free, am I right?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.385
Teachers do not
eat for free.

03:04.452 --> 03:06.053
You've just been grabbing
food without paying?

03:06.119 --> 03:07.521
(SCOFFS) No.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.560
(DOOR CLOSES)

03:12.626 --> 03:13.927
She was a crap student.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.563
Now she's
a crap teacher.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.930
I give her
three weeks, tops.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.066
I can turn her around.
It's what I do.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.268
I mold young minds,

03:20.334 --> 03:21.802
and I'm guessing hers
is pretty soft.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.804
You're great with kids, CB,
but this is different.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.273
Lainey's generally
disappointing.

03:25.339 --> 03:26.407
You wanna bet?

03:26.474 --> 03:27.641
I know for a fact

03:27.708 --> 03:29.277
that I can transform her
into a good teacher.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.544
Name your price.
Discman.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.945
One of those fancy kinds

03:32.012 --> 03:33.814
that can handle
light splashing.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.616
I listen in the tub.
You're on.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.921
It's my nubs,
isn't it?
I don't...

03:40.988 --> 03:42.256
Say it.
Say it's my nubs.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.691
It's not...
It's not your nubs.

was making his bet,

Ah, that's my bad.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.491
Got distracted
talking to Lana Eisenstein.

Ooh, see, I told you,
Tom Scott.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.128
Joining
the decorating committee

04:21.194 --> 04:23.196
was a great way to break
the ice with Lana.
Yeah.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.133
This guy is helping you
score a date?

04:26.199 --> 04:27.301
Oh, no, not yet.

Create the most destruction.
"...create the
most destruction."

04:33.341 --> 04:34.442
It's not
a perfect metaphor,

04:34.508 --> 04:36.143
but it gets
the point across.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.978
If your point
is failure.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.780
Eisenstein plays
the tuba, right?

Oh, like an angel.

Next band practice,
I want you to take her tuba,

04:42.750 --> 04:43.817
I want you to lift it
in the air,

04:43.884 --> 04:44.952
and I want you to say,

"Hey, let's go
to the dance together."

04:47.087 --> 04:50.123
Lifting something
is not gonna get him
a date to a dance.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.859
Of course it will!

04:51.925 --> 04:53.160
You lift with your core.

04:53.226 --> 04:54.995
At the center
of your core
is your heart,

04:55.062 --> 04:56.730
AKA, the love muscle.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.667
The lift showcases
the strength of said muscle.

04:59.733 --> 05:02.135
Everything
you just said is dumb.

will fly, too.

waiting for?

you meant Don Juan.

date a teacher here.

that your code
is a load of crap

05:52.920 --> 05:54.922
and will only make
your sad life sadder.

like a regular man, John.

asking out Liz. Ever.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.828
LAINEY: While Coach
was suddenly falling
for one teacher,

07:07.895 --> 07:09.797
I was about to get
tricked by another.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.965
Oh, well, if it isn't
Teacher of the Year.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.801
Look, I see that
you're struggling to fit in,

07:13.867 --> 07:16.003
and I think
I can help, okay?

07:16.069 --> 07:17.771
I know what it's like
to be new.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.173
(CLANGING)

07:23.744 --> 07:25.513
So, I just want to help.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.647
Fine.

07:26.714 --> 07:27.881
What's your big advice?

07:27.948 --> 07:29.316
If you want
their respect,

07:29.382 --> 07:30.651
you have to show them
that you care.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.653
Get involved.
Reach out to a kid.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.054
Oh, I care!

07:34.121 --> 07:35.255
I'm a caring nightmare.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.990
I'll bet you right now
I can help some kid.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.026
Don't want to bet.
Loser buys the other
a Discman.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.294
Is there something
about DiscmanS
that I'm not getting?

07:41.361 --> 07:43.296
Just give me
the motivation!
Fine.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.734
I bet you can't
make a difference
in a kid's life.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.135
(SNAPS FINGERS)
You're on, assface.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
I know just the kid.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.641
I'm going to the dance
with Lana!

07:53.707 --> 07:55.342
Nice, Tom Scott!

07:55.408 --> 07:57.144
I told you
taking it slow would work.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.445
Totally.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.413
Also, this morning,
I lifted her tuba and said,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.215
"We should go
to the dance together."

08:02.282 --> 08:04.351
Oh, wait, so you took
the coach's advice?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.753
And it worked.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.588
Although I farted
when I lifted the tuba,

08:07.655 --> 08:10.090
but Lana was too nice
to say anything.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.324
Wow. I can't believe it.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.760
Oh, yeah, me neither.
(CHUCKLES)

08:12.826 --> 08:14.662
It was a real dooze.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.230
You know,
the best part is,

08:17.297 --> 08:19.600
for the first time
since I've been
at this school,

08:19.667 --> 08:21.268
I, uh...
I don't feel so lonely.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.405
I want love in my life
like Tom Scott.

08:25.472 --> 08:26.674
Give me some dumb advice

08:26.740 --> 08:28.241
so that I can date
Liz Fleming.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.610
No, you were right.
I don't know what
I'm talking about.

08:29.677 --> 08:30.811
You're the one
who helped Tom.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.045
But your dumb words
put him over the top.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.714
As your friend,
I need to remind you,

08:33.781 --> 08:34.948
you have a code,

08:35.015 --> 08:36.884
and that is that you check
your life at the flagpole.

08:36.950 --> 08:37.951
Forget Fleming.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.519
Why do you have
that play drawn up

08:39.587 --> 08:41.955
with X's and hearts
instead of X's and O's?

08:42.956 --> 08:45.192
Wait. You like
Liz Fleming now?

08:45.258 --> 08:46.794
Well, I didn't intend
for this to happen,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.896
but when she wrapped
her bird-like arms

08:48.962 --> 08:50.230
around that filing cabinet,

08:50.297 --> 08:51.965
she didn't just lift
a piece of furniture.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.533
She...lifted my heart!

08:53.601 --> 08:55.202
Then game on,
as they say.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.070
You don't say that.
I say that!

08:57.137 --> 08:58.471
Well, I say it now, too.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.407
Game on!
You're not
saying it right.

09:00.473 --> 09:01.609
It's "game on!"

09:01.675 --> 09:02.876
I'm gonna
make it my own.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.111
Game on!
Game on!

09:04.177 --> 09:05.178
Game on!
Game on!

09:05.245 --> 09:07.581
Game on!
On, on, on, on, on!

09:07.648 --> 09:09.817
LAINEY:
While Mellor and Glascott
tore each other down...

09:09.883 --> 09:11.251
Aah!

09:11.318 --> 09:12.820
...I was eager to build up
Harriet's confidence.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.122
So, I sense you'd like more
from your life at school.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.356
Am I right?

09:16.423 --> 09:17.658
Well, sure.
That would be good.

09:17.725 --> 09:18.892
Well, I pulled your file,

09:18.959 --> 09:20.628
and I see you're
on the debate team,

09:20.694 --> 09:21.795
but you never compete.

09:21.862 --> 09:23.330
Sounds like
a lack of confidence.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.232
And that's just...
I want a makeover!

09:25.298 --> 09:26.299
What's that?

09:26.366 --> 09:27.968
New hair, new shoes,
new clothes,

09:28.035 --> 09:29.903
that's the kind
of "more" I want.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.672
Listen, I hear
what you're saying,

09:31.739 --> 09:33.807
but I've got a plan
to turn you
into a superstar

09:33.874 --> 09:35.475
that's way more than just
a new pair of shoes.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.610
And your jacket.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.045
I want that jacket.

09:38.111 --> 09:39.947
And I want it
off your body
so it has your musk.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.114
Okay, that's good.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.415
And strange.

09:42.482 --> 09:44.251
But you're telling me
what you want. I like it.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.953
You do?
Yes.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.354
You know what
happens sometimes

09:47.420 --> 09:48.689
when you only change
what's on the outside?

09:50.057 --> 09:52.059
It makes you feel
damn good on the inside!

09:52.125 --> 09:53.827
We're doing
a makeover!
Yes!

09:53.894 --> 09:55.228
LAINEY: Just like that,

09:55.295 --> 09:56.697
I had the perfect way
to show off to my peers

09:56.764 --> 09:58.231
and finally
earn their respect.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.200
I'm sure you're all
wondering why I've
called you here.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.501
It's come
to my attention

10:01.568 --> 10:03.036
that I don't
have your respect,

10:03.103 --> 10:04.872
because some
of you don't think
I'm a very good teacher.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.139
It's all of us.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.208
Well, then you're about
to owe me an apology,

10:08.275 --> 10:10.110
because I am
about to turn

10:10.177 --> 10:11.712
Harriet Tubman's life
around.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.146
Oh, I don't know
her last name,

10:13.213 --> 10:14.682
but I'm sure
it's not Tubman.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.349
Introducing the new,

10:16.416 --> 10:17.951
not improved
but different,

10:18.652 --> 10:20.153
Harriet Tubman!

10:20.220 --> 10:21.454
Stop saying Tubman.

What, uh...

10:43.110 --> 10:45.178
(STAMMERS)
What's happening here?
I'm inspiring a student.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.180
To be more shallow?
To be more confident!

10:47.247 --> 10:49.616

like my jams in the tub.
Okay.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.251
Look, I'm just
getting started here.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.686
Besides,
people are gonna notice

10:52.753 --> 10:54.354
Harriet's new attitude
more than anything.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.522
BECKY: Holy crap!

10:55.588 --> 10:58.158
Harriet looks like
an MTV VJ!

10:58.225 --> 11:00.027
I have play practice
after school,

11:00.093 --> 11:02.595
I'd skip it
if you could make my boobs
look like that.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.197
You're the lead.
You cannot skip.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.399
Forget the play!
I want boobs!

11:06.466 --> 11:08.168
All right, you know what? As
long as I'm at this school...
Please, I...

11:08.235 --> 11:09.502
...you won't have boobs.
Please, please.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.905
Okay, I see how this might not
be helping my case.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.540
You she's-all-that'd
a student.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.208
You're a teacher,
not a stylist.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.045
You know what?
I am done with this.
I deserve your respect.

11:18.111 --> 11:20.748
And if you can't see that,
well, then,
you're all just a bunch

11:20.814 --> 11:22.115
of crusty,
old dill holes.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.283
Dill hole?

11:24.251 --> 11:25.352
Just...

11:29.189 --> 11:31.591
Rubba-dub-dub.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.526
I had failed
to win the teachers over,

11:33.593 --> 11:36.964
but CB still had his bet with
Crosby, and he wasn't about
to lose.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.199
Again,
it's not free, so...

11:39.266 --> 11:40.768
Everybody does it.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.636
Look. (SIGHS)
I just wanted to apologize.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.138
I was too harsh yesterday,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.741
and if you're interested,
I'd still like to help.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.977
Why?
Simple.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.578
I really do
believe in you, Lainey.

11:51.644 --> 11:52.946
You actually mean that?

11:53.013 --> 11:54.381
Of course I do! Yes!

11:55.448 --> 11:56.884
So where do we start?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.185
Teach me to teach.
I'm ready.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.822
Okay, to get
the teachers' respect,

12:01.889 --> 12:03.123
you have to prove to them

12:03.190 --> 12:04.657
that you can
reach the kids.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.160
Now, to do that,
you have to be creative...

12:08.161 --> 12:09.296
...and potentially

12:09.362 --> 12:10.363
daring.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.432
Now let the show begin.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.401
Uh, "show"?

an easier way.

Okay, you're dressed like
a teenager going to the mall.

they can be just as shallow

12:56.276 --> 12:57.544
as the students,

12:57.610 --> 12:59.146
and appearances...
they matter.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.981
Yes, yes! I'll do the
easy shallow thing.

the punch bowl.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.704
And?
Poor John.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.941
You've checked your life
at the flagpole for so long,

14:34.007 --> 14:35.775
you don't even know
about punch bowl babies.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.710
This is definitely
not a thing.

14:37.777 --> 14:41.481
1975, Howard and Dirksen
worked the bowl, baby!

14:41.548 --> 14:44.317
'82, Edsall and Muransky,
baby!

14:44.384 --> 14:47.420
1985,
Guarascio and Secunda,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.756
a beautiful adopted
Chinese baby!

14:49.822 --> 14:52.059
Coincidence.
There's magic in that punch,

14:52.125 --> 14:53.961
and Liz and I will share
its sweet nectar.

14:54.027 --> 14:56.163
"Game on"
will be game over.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.498
(GROANS)

14:58.565 --> 15:00.300
LAINEY: In the battle
for Liz Fleming's heart,

15:00.367 --> 15:01.834
Coach had pulled way ahead.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.304
Meanwhile, Crosby was ready
to admit defeat.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.306
Here's your Discman.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.008
These things
are very expensive.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.276
Ah, we're teachers.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.910
Everything's expensive
to us.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.680
(APPLAUSE IN DISTANCE)

15:15.682 --> 15:19.386
HARRIET: Statistics are
undeniable, and the
evidence is clear.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.822
In conclusion,
the chair is life.

15:22.889 --> 15:23.923
(APPLAUSE)

15:23.991 --> 15:25.125
Harriet is crushing it.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.994
I don't even believe
in capital punishment,

15:27.060 --> 15:28.295
but this has
got me thinkin'.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.330
She's like
a different person.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.099
You mean
a confident person?

15:32.165 --> 15:33.800
JUDGE: The winner is...

15:34.567 --> 15:36.036
...Harriet Jones!

15:36.103 --> 15:37.470
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
Oh, my God! Yes!

15:37.537 --> 15:38.705
I did it! I did it!

15:38.771 --> 15:40.207
Okay, you're right.
Her name's not Tubman.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.941
But I was right, too.
The makeover worked.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.676
You didn't need me
at all.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.345
You knew what you were doing
all along.

15:45.412 --> 15:46.813
Well, either way,

15:46.879 --> 15:49.282
it still felt great to have
one person believe in me.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.950
Um, yeah, about that...

15:51.018 --> 15:53.353
Boo-yeah! I won.
I did it. Mmm-hmm.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.455
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
you don't still owe me
a Discman.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.889
I won our bet, so gimme.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.458
Oh, no, no, no.
That's not your Discman.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.493
That's mine.
What?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.195
You just admitted
that she was a good teacher,

16:02.262 --> 16:03.630
which makes our bet
null and void.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.032
What's he talking about?
Why is he pawing at
my Discman?

16:05.098 --> 16:06.166
Gimme!

16:06.233 --> 16:07.500
He made a bet

16:07.567 --> 16:09.202
that he could change you
from a lousy teacher

16:09.269 --> 16:10.970
into one of us.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.740
But you were already
one of us.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.509
So...gimme!

16:16.576 --> 16:19.546
Wait, so while I was just
she's-all-that'ing Harriet,

16:19.612 --> 16:21.048
were you really just
she's-all-that'ing me?

16:21.114 --> 16:22.382
(SIGHS)

16:22.449 --> 16:24.151
Am I a bet?

16:24.217 --> 16:25.818
Am I a friggin' bet?!

16:25.885 --> 16:27.887
You were
she's-all-that'ing me?
Uh-oh.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.122
Am I a bet?

16:29.189 --> 16:30.490
Am I a friggin' bet?

16:30.557 --> 16:32.959
It started as a bet,
but I really believe in you.
I do.

16:33.026 --> 16:34.594
You do?

16:34.661 --> 16:36.563
Of course.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.865
And now everyone else does,
too, because you killed
it today. That was all you.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.933
I think all that stuff
about you.
Not now, CB!

16:41.000 --> 16:43.770
I'm sorry, Harriet.
I, I really am.

16:44.604 --> 16:45.872
Don't be.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.740
I just won
my first debate,

16:47.807 --> 16:49.076
and I'm going to the dance,

16:49.142 --> 16:51.111
and I look hot!

16:51.178 --> 16:53.280
You can bet about me
anytime.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.082
Oh.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.717
Wow.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.219
That was not
like the movie.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.888
You know what?
Everyone thinks you're
this great super teacher.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.790
Well, I think
you're just a jerk.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.459
And you dressed me up
like Mrs. Doubtfire!
You're a monster!

17:11.598 --> 17:14.801
LAINEY: It was the night of
the big dance, and Coach had
finally secured his date

17:14.867 --> 17:16.836
at the punch bowl
along with Liz Fleming.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.371
Punch has a sweet aroma,
don't you think?

17:18.438 --> 17:20.773
I don't like men telling me
how to perceive the world.

17:20.840 --> 17:23.276
But, yeah, I love
that tutti-frutti.

17:23.343 --> 17:26.045
Well, looks like
you two could use a hand.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.948
Or should I say
a "ladle"?

17:29.015 --> 17:31.718
My lord, that's the biggest
ladle I've ever seen.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.453
Yes, it's forged
with German steel

17:33.520 --> 17:34.921
and does the work
of two men.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.956
So, Coach, you can go.
I got this.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.126
Everyone knows
ladling is about speed.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.594
(LAUGHS)
See, it's, uh...

17:41.661 --> 17:43.596
Rapid fire,
that's the key.

17:43.663 --> 17:44.964
See this?

17:45.031 --> 17:46.166
Look at all the punch

17:46.233 --> 17:49.068
in my big,
German engineered spoon.

17:49.136 --> 17:50.170
Check this out.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.738
Okay, I don't know
why you guys

17:51.804 --> 17:53.706
are ramming
your heads together
like two bighorn sheep,

17:53.773 --> 17:55.708
but I'm stepping
out of here.

17:56.843 --> 17:57.910
What is your problem?

17:57.977 --> 17:59.746
My problem is
my so-called friend

17:59.812 --> 18:00.980
told me to ask out Fleming

18:01.047 --> 18:02.449
before he tried
to steal her!

18:02.515 --> 18:04.284
You said you'd never, ever
ask her out

18:04.351 --> 18:05.985
and that
your so-called friend

18:06.052 --> 18:07.154
was just
your co-worker!

18:07.220 --> 18:08.955
Actually, "co-worker"
isn't quite right.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.823
What you really are
is my underling.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.993
Rick Mellor is under
no man and no ling.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.862
Call it what you want,
but I'm your boss.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.397
And your boss needs you
to patrol

18:17.464 --> 18:18.865
outside the school
tonight.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.367
You're kicking me out?

18:21.234 --> 18:22.235
Here's a walkie-talkie

18:22.302 --> 18:24.171
just in case
you get lost in the woods.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.938
I guess
one thing's for sure.

18:26.005 --> 18:28.908
We really aren't friends
after all.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.313
LAINEY: Glascott's victory
felt hollow,

18:33.380 --> 18:35.715
and Coach discovered
he wasn't the only one
feeling defeated.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.984
Tom Scott?
What are you
doing out here, son?

18:38.050 --> 18:39.319
I need
Principal Glascott.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.720
Tom Scott's
asking for you.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.022
Drop the ladle
and step away from the punch!

18:43.089 --> 18:45.024
Switch it up!
I'm coming in! Yeah!

18:45.091 --> 18:46.125
TOM: No, I need both of you!

18:46.193 --> 18:47.994
Ah, damn it!

18:48.060 --> 18:50.963
I mean,
sure, Tom Scott.

18:51.030 --> 18:52.432
Follow me.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.535
Tom Scott,
what are you doing?

18:55.602 --> 18:57.003
Your date's inside waiting.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.571
She's not my date.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.340
Lana said she just
wants to be friends.

19:00.407 --> 19:01.841
Ah, it's not so bad.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.244
Girlfriends come and go,
but a friend?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.345
That's forever.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.046
If the friendship's real.

19:07.113 --> 19:08.248
Coach is right.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.183
Friendship means
more than anything,

19:10.250 --> 19:11.818
even if sometimes
we forget that.

19:13.019 --> 19:14.854
Yeah, us guys
can get so caught up

19:14.921 --> 19:16.556
in romance
and school dances

19:16.623 --> 19:17.924
that we lose sight
of that.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.025
And who knows?

19:19.091 --> 19:21.661
Maybe one day
you'll grow into good friends.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.029
Or close friends.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.897
Or even best friends.
Or lovers. (CHUCKLES)

19:24.964 --> 19:26.065
No. That's too much.
That's too far.

19:26.132 --> 19:27.434
Why don't you
go on inside?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.236
Come on. Okay.
Thanks.
You guys are the best.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.837
(SIGHS)

19:30.903 --> 19:32.004
Sorry for everything,
Coach.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.573
Ah, me, too.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.042
And as far as Liz Fleming
is concerned,
I'm bowing out.

19:36.108 --> 19:37.310
I am, too.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.878
Some things
are more important.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.213
Thanks, John.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.018
* Kiss me

19:46.085 --> 19:49.155
* Out of the bearded barley

19:49.222 --> 19:51.891
* Nightly
Beside the green,
green grass *

19:51.958 --> 19:53.926
I sucked, too.
What?

19:53.993 --> 19:57.364
When I started teaching,
I was nervous and insecure.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.031
Really?
Yeah.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.534
I was wrong about you,
Lainey.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.602
You get these kids

20:02.669 --> 20:04.170
way more than I did
when I started.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.506
Thank you for that.

20:06.573 --> 20:09.141
And if I can grow into this
amazing molder of young minds

20:09.208 --> 20:10.910
you see before you,

20:10.977 --> 20:12.712
who knows how great of
a teacher you can be.

20:12.779 --> 20:13.913
(CHUCKLES)

20:13.980 --> 20:15.214
So, are we good?

20:15.282 --> 20:16.749
Yeah.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.418
* And make the fireflies dance

20:18.485 --> 20:21.488
* Silver moon's sparkling *

20:21.554 --> 20:23.089
LAINEY: Everyone wants
to fit in...

20:23.155 --> 20:25.057
...and be respected.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.427
But that day, I realized
you can't be your best

20:27.494 --> 20:29.562
unless you have
confidence in yourself

20:29.629 --> 20:31.464
and trust your instincts.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.466
And that is how
I finally figured out

20:33.533 --> 20:36.235
exactly the kind of teacher
I would be.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.511
Hello, everybody, I'm sitting
here with the real,
actual C.B.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.579
What's the greatest thing
about being a teacher?

20:46.646 --> 20:48.481
Getting to be involved
in kids' lives

20:48.548 --> 20:49.716
and just
seeing them grow.

20:49.782 --> 20:51.050
How did
you make learning fun?

20:51.117 --> 20:53.420
I make sure that the kids know
that I love them.

20:53.486 --> 20:55.021
Yeah.
So that when I scream at them,

20:55.087 --> 20:56.188
they still know
that I love them,

20:56.255 --> 20:57.590
and I find that
that works, so...

20:57.657 --> 20:59.492
That's really manipulative,
and I love it.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.160
Did you do impressions,
or like...?

21:01.227 --> 21:02.995
(AS JOHN WAYNE)
Well, I don't know, pilgrim.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.130
(LAUGHS)

21:04.196 --> 21:05.465
(NORMAL VOICE)
We can end it at that.

21:05.532 --> 21:06.666
Has there ever been a student

21:06.733 --> 21:08.067
that has become
a teacher?

21:08.134 --> 21:09.502
Rick Mellor was a student

21:09.569 --> 21:11.203
and came back
to be a teacher.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.005
Can you break-dance?
Yeah.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.874
In my day.
Now my arms would fall off.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.042
Got to go like this.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.209
Okay, yeah.
No, that'll work.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.311
Grab your foot.
Yeah.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.646
And then you
jump over it.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.813
Oh, my God.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.682
So, yeah.
You just do that.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.617
(GRUNTS)
Whoa!

21:24.684 --> 21:26.453
That's really impressive.
