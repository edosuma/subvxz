02:06.259 --> 02:07.988
Give me your press badge.

02:08.194 --> 02:10.185
No way, you're not my dad!

02:10.396 --> 02:12.796
Then I shall take it by force.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.763
Ooh! He's my brother!

02:14.934 --> 02:16.731
Then you shouldn't have
made out with him.

03:06.786 --> 03:08.219
So, your name's Dan?

03:08.388 --> 03:12.222
Yeah, Dan... Dan Quint.
Like on the resume.

03:12.392 --> 03:15.884
Dan Quint. Born 1990.
I didn't think that was possible.

03:16.062 --> 03:17.359
Yeah, 1990.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.293
People are born every year so that's-

03:20.934 --> 03:24.028
What do you hope to get out of being
in the mailroom, Dan?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.196
I guess I hope to get out of
being in the mailroom.

03:27.807 --> 03:30.674
You got sass. I like it.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.868
Guess what? You're hired.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.640
I'm Lemuel Gulliver.
Welcome to the team.

03:36.816 --> 03:37.783
I was hired...

03:38.952 --> 03:39.941
yesterday by HR.

03:40.119 --> 03:41.882
- Doggy wants a bone.
- What?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.750
Doggy wants a bone.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.284
Floor 30. This is the editors' floor.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.069
Oh, yeah.

03:48.070 --> 03:49.553
- This is the epicenter, my friend.
- Okay.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.492
- Feel it. Feel it.
- Okay.

03:51.664 --> 03:52.995
Got a little something for you.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.091
Ah... God dang it! Sorry about that.

03:55.268 --> 03:57.498
Listen, I will dry-clean that.
Sorry about that. My bad.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.767
- You just wait out here.
- What?

04:00.940 --> 04:02.498
One second.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.000
Here's your mail, sir.

04:06.179 --> 04:07.908
Oh... hey, you're Harold Jones, right?

04:08.081 --> 04:09.605
Yeah.

04:09.782 --> 04:12.376
I loved your piece on the failure
of the derivative markets.

04:12.552 --> 04:13.519
Thanks very much.

04:13.686 --> 04:15.176
I look forward to seeing you around.

04:15.355 --> 04:16.686
Thank you...

04:16.856 --> 04:19.450
from me and all the readers.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.353
Dan, what are you doing?
You can't talk to those guys!

04:23.529 --> 04:24.553
- Why not?
- Because...

04:24.731 --> 04:27.063
Okay, this is your first day.
We are the mailroom guys.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.793
Mailroom guys are meant to
be seen and not heard.

04:29.969 --> 04:31.869
And ideally, not even seen, okay?

04:32.038 --> 04:33.801
We're not on their level.
We're the little people.

04:33.973 --> 04:35.873
No, you know what it is? I think
you're just scared to talk to them.

04:36.042 --> 04:39.569
I am not! Dude, listen. I'm just
respectful of their workspace.

04:39.746 --> 04:42.146
I talk to these people all the ti...

04:49.188 --> 04:50.358
Glad you think so.
I'll let you know as soon as

04:50.359 --> 04:51.554
I've made a decision, Nigel.

04:51.724 --> 04:54.056
Okey-dokey, thank you.
Good day, fellas.

04:54.527 --> 04:55.789
- Good day.
- Good day, mate.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.691
Gulliver, got any mail for me?

04:57.864 --> 04:59.798
Yeah... No... Maybe.

04:59.966 --> 05:00.990
Let me check.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.397
- Hi, I'm Dan, from the mailroom.
- Hey. Darcy.

05:03.569 --> 05:06.367
And I'll do whatever it takes to
not be from the mailroom.

05:07.173 --> 05:09.607
Dan doesn't need to be bothering
her right now. She's busy.

05:09.776 --> 05:10.640
He isn't bothering me.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.505
I love to have a reason
to procrastinate.

05:12.679 --> 05:14.078
Yeah, me, too.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.011
You're not bugging me. There you go.

05:17.183 --> 05:18.673
Well, I'll see you guys later.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.284
- Good to see you.
- Okay.

05:20.486 --> 05:22.351
Oh, boy. Let's go.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.024
So, how long have you had this

05:26.025 --> 05:27.958
debilitating crush on
the travel editor?

05:28.161 --> 05:30.186
Crush? On Darcy? No way, dude.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.830
Okay! First of all,
you're a terrible liar.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.898
Second of all,
why don't you just ask her out?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.035
- You don't think I could ask her out?
- No.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.568
I could ask her out whenever,
wherever. It's no problem.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.707
It would take me five seconds.
<i>Will you go out with me?</i>"Yes." Done.

05:41.874 --> 05:43.273
I'm not going out with
Darcy Silverman.

05:43.274 --> 05:44.672
We are boyfriend and girlfriend.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.607
You know "Gulliver and Darcy?" Yeah,
they're like "Cutest couple ever."

05:46.779 --> 05:49.942
Okay. So, then, do it.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.776
Next time I see her, I will.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.680
- Hold on! Hi, again.
- Uhm!

05:53.886 --> 05:55.478
Oh... hey, Darcy.

05:55.655 --> 05:59.056
I just remembered,
I get claustrophobic in elevators.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.557
- How is your day going?
- Really good.

06:08.735 --> 06:09.963
Just really, really, good.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.468
- What are you doing this weekend?
- So much stuff.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.368
It's just going to be... you know,
a bunch of stuff.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.634
- Cool.
- Yeah, it's cool.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.183
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.880
Wait! I forgot something.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.719
Yeah, me, too.

06:46.606 --> 06:47.470
So?

06:49.041 --> 06:50.235
Yeah?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.604
Yeah!

06:51.978 --> 06:53.172
You chickened out, didn't you?

06:53.980 --> 06:57.939
I wasn't... I just... You know...
I didn't chicken out.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.658
You're being respectful
of her workspace.

06:59.660 --> 07:00.549
Exactly.

07:00.559 --> 07:01.248
Dude.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.979
Speaking of which, after work...

07:03.156 --> 07:06.353
do you want to go for a couple
of brews and shoot some poos?

07:06.526 --> 07:07.993
Maybe a little man-date.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.358
I don't think so. Especially because
you called it a man-date.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.123
I got you. You want a rain check.

07:13.299 --> 07:16.632
You want to wake up all bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed for the boss.

07:17.136 --> 07:19.195
You're not my boss anymore.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.532
What are you talking about?

07:21.073 --> 07:22.768
I just got promoted.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.176
That's impossible. You just got here.

07:26.345 --> 07:29.041
Yeah, they promoted me...

07:29.215 --> 07:31.149
to head of the mailroom.

07:31.317 --> 07:32.807
So, I'm your boss now.

07:35.588 --> 07:40.321
Look, Gulliver, the reason you didn't
ask her out and you never will...

07:40.526 --> 07:43.324
is the same reason that you're
not going to leave the mailroom.

07:43.496 --> 07:46.124
You've been here like 10 years, man.

07:49.335 --> 07:50.563
You peaked.

07:51.070 --> 07:54.870
You talk a big game
and that can be fun, sometimes.

07:55.508 --> 07:58.807
And you're pretty funny around the
office, but that's all you are.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.240
It's just talk.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.040
So you might as well face it...

08:02.215 --> 08:04.683
you're never really going to
get any bigger than this.

08:08.421 --> 08:12.289
These talks. This is the worst part
about being a boss.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.257
Anyway, be in tomorrow at 7:00.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.191
We're going to sort of
change things up...

08:17.363 --> 08:20.799
and we're gonna start with getting rid
of "Guitar Hero" during work hours.

08:31.544 --> 08:32.738
Night, Darcy.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.013
See you.

08:50.196 --> 08:50.958
Gulliver?

08:53.232 --> 08:54.256
Hi.

08:55.301 --> 08:56.427
Hi.

08:56.602 --> 08:57.626
Can I help you?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.762
Yeah, I...

09:01.374 --> 09:03.899
Well, I wanted to see...

09:05.177 --> 09:06.769
if you wanted to...

09:10.616 --> 09:12.743
You seem a little nervous.
Are you all right?

09:12.919 --> 09:14.443
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

09:15.655 --> 09:16.747
I got so much going on.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.428
I wanted to pick this up,
and then I was on my way.

09:19.438 --> 09:21.208
You want to apply for
a travel writing assignment?

09:21.349 --> 09:21.846
Huh?

09:24.263 --> 09:26.094
Yeah. Exactly.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.756
I had no idea you wrote or traveled.

09:28.935 --> 09:31.870
I do. I travel a lot.
I go to New Zealand.

09:32.038 --> 09:35.337
Been to Mexico.
Méjico, they call it...

09:35.508 --> 09:36.839
in the locals.

09:37.009 --> 09:38.499
Africa, the Congo.

09:38.678 --> 09:42.170
Which I know is in Africa
because I travel and write.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.343
So this is kind of what I want to do.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.134
Well! Why don't you bring
in a writing sample

09:47.135 --> 09:48.749
tomorrow morning and
I'll see what I can do.

09:49.755 --> 09:50.779
Perfect.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.654
- Okay.
- Okay.

09:54.560 --> 09:55.754
Hey, Gulliver.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.490
Nice job putting yourself out there.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.394
Yeah. Cool. Okay, bye-bye.

10:01.567 --> 10:02.829
Bye-bye.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.548
I should've just manned up
and asked her out.

10:21.721 --> 10:24.155
Now she's expecting a writing sample?
What was I thinking?

10:24.323 --> 10:27.656
<i>♪ I saw some things
In different lands</i>

10:34.066 --> 10:36.899
Karate chop...
I gotta write this thing!

10:37.837 --> 10:40.305
No, I got nothing.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.062
I am so impressed, Gulliver.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.605
I had no idea
you were such a good writer.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.867
Yeah... well.
I kind of keep it secret.

11:17.877 --> 11:20.405
I don't like to brag about
my more literarian side.

11:20.579 --> 11:21.671
These samples are terrific.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.281
And you exhibit such variety.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.199
I mean, this one about
Oaxaca feels really classic,

11:27.200 --> 11:28.737
like it came straight out
of Frommer's...

11:28.988 --> 11:31.616
whereas the description
of Barcelona is all...

11:31.791 --> 11:33.088
sassy.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.920
It's like I'm reading <i>Time Out.</i>

11:36.395 --> 11:37.225
Yeah.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.263
I think I have the perfect fluff piece
to start you off with.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.066
There's a guy down in
Bermuda who claims

11:42.067 --> 11:43.698
he has the secret to
the Bermuda Triangle.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.702
He's either crazy or he's trying
to bilk tourists. But I figure...

11:46.872 --> 11:48.965
it could be a fun way in...

11:49.141 --> 11:51.939
to explore Bermuda and the
smaller islands around it, you know.

11:52.111 --> 11:53.772
You do have boat experience,
don't you?

11:53.946 --> 11:57.404
I'm a... boat... man.

11:57.583 --> 11:58.607
I'm a boatman.

11:58.784 --> 11:59.978
Okay, good...

12:00.753 --> 12:03.449
because I have to be honest, it was
hard to find someone to do this.

12:03.622 --> 12:06.557
You have to be at sea for three weeks,
completely off the grid.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.023
That's okay with you, right?

12:08.194 --> 12:09.027
- Hmm.
- Good, because I thought...

12:09.028 --> 12:12.987
I was going to have to do it and
I get like, super seasick. It's crazy.

12:14.266 --> 12:15.255
- Yeah.
- So, what do you say?

12:15.601 --> 12:18.627
It's not a big story,
but it's a start.

12:22.441 --> 12:24.466
Okay! So, the Bermuda Triangle, huh?

12:24.643 --> 12:26.076
And everything I need
to know is in here?

12:26.245 --> 12:28.440
It is. Your contact's been arranged...

12:28.614 --> 12:30.639
and there's a boat waiting for you.

12:31.517 --> 12:32.485
Yeah.

12:51.637 --> 12:52.501
That's me!

12:53.139 --> 12:56.973
Okay, precious cargo!
No, no, no... okay!

12:57.143 --> 12:58.610
That was close.

13:00.179 --> 13:02.613
All you chickens,
get out of the road, man!

13:04.416 --> 13:05.781
I don't know about this, Hank.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.283
I mean, are you sure this is safe?

13:08.454 --> 13:11.423
All this Bermuda Triangle talk
is just to sell T-shirts to tourists.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.286
You know, it makes for good stories...

13:13.296 --> 13:16.123
if you want to skeet-skeet
with the girls on the mainland.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.785
This is your boat.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.525
Knotfersail.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.461
They really went pun-tastic
on that boat.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.295
Yeah! The dock master's really
into puns, man.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.063
He believes it keeps the pirates away.

13:26.238 --> 13:28.502
Ship Happens.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.142
This is you,
and the dot is your destination.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.074
You just follow that dot, and you'll
find yourself in a triangle.

13:34.246 --> 13:35.543
- In the Bermuda Triangle?
- Yeah.

13:35.714 --> 13:37.807
And then to come home,
you say I turn this knob...

13:37.983 --> 13:39.416
and I follow the dot back home?

13:39.618 --> 13:40.516
Yeah.

13:40.686 --> 13:41.880
- Easy.
- Yes! Easy.

13:42.054 --> 13:43.180
- Done.
- Done.

13:43.355 --> 13:44.845
- Alright!
- I've got it.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.127
I am fine.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.058
Fine.

13:51.664 --> 13:56.033
It's not moving.
Okay, where's the clutch?

14:01.607 --> 14:04.474
And as you go out to
the ocean water...

14:04.643 --> 14:07.237
towards the Bermuda Triangle...

14:07.413 --> 14:11.179
there's reflections everywhere.
I should've brought some sunglasses.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.875
I am as hungry as a horse.

14:14.053 --> 14:15.884
I could eat 1,000 cheeseburgers.

14:16.055 --> 14:17.283
Okay.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.618
Quitting time.

14:23.762 --> 14:24.751
Yeah.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.190
How to build your own robot?

14:29.368 --> 14:30.703
Yeah, that's going to happen.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.787
Darcy.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.797
Cheeseburger.

15:01.967 --> 15:02.729
Darcy.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.900
Cheeseburger.

15:30.529 --> 15:31.461
No!

15:41.540 --> 15:42.666
Safety! Okay.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.333
Rubber ducky.

15:44.510 --> 15:45.374
No!

15:45.811 --> 15:47.142
Floaties! Floatie one.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.974
Floatie leg, floatie left...

15:49.148 --> 15:50.172
floatie right, floatie head.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.276
I am safe!

15:52.651 --> 15:53.777
There is no...

15:59.425 --> 16:00.619
9-1-1.

16:01.560 --> 16:02.652
Oh, no.

16:15.741 --> 16:17.106
Oh, God, help me!

16:35.928 --> 16:37.589
Oh, I'm paralyzed from the neck down.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.856
What's that crawling on me?

16:40.032 --> 16:43.399
Not fire ants.
Please don't be fire ants.

16:45.738 --> 16:49.105
I am General Edward Edwardian,
Commander of Lilliput.

16:49.274 --> 16:50.605
All hail Lilliput!

16:50.776 --> 16:52.243
All hail Lilliput!

16:52.411 --> 16:56.745
You are herewith charged with aiding
our sworn enemy, the Blefuscians.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.114
You are my prisoner,
and shall be presented

17:00.115 --> 17:02.110
to our Royal Highness, King Theodore.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.754
What say you...

17:04.056 --> 17:05.182
beast?

17:27.746 --> 17:29.373
You are not real! Where is my...?

17:29.548 --> 17:30.537
Where am I?

17:30.716 --> 17:31.614
This must be a dream.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.508
I'm gonna close my eyes,
and then I'm gonna open them,

17:34.518 --> 17:35.609
and I'll be home in bed.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.279
Okay! Okay!

17:39.758 --> 17:40.884
My spear!

17:44.730 --> 17:46.493
Bring the beast down!

17:46.665 --> 17:48.929
All right, boys! Release the hookers.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.234
Pull, pull!

17:52.171 --> 17:53.729
Hey!

17:53.906 --> 17:54.668
Pull!

17:54.840 --> 17:56.307
Hey, not cool.

17:56.475 --> 17:58.602
Hey, that's my pants.
That's not funny!

18:05.250 --> 18:06.342
Unlucky.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.829
Heave!

18:22.901 --> 18:24.459
Heave!

18:24.636 --> 18:26.866
It was awful, horrid! Nightmarish!

18:27.039 --> 18:29.701
I was trapped in the valley
of violent rumbles.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.536
I was nauseous!

19:09.915 --> 19:10.745
Lift!

19:13.485 --> 19:15.077
Squad, halt!

19:16.088 --> 19:17.521
This giant is hereby declared...

19:17.689 --> 19:20.920
the property of
His Majesty King Theodore.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.323
All hail King Theodore!

19:23.495 --> 19:25.554
All hail King Theodore!

19:32.037 --> 19:35.570
I wanted a bracelet,
not a great big hairy beast.

19:39.144 --> 19:42.875
Oh, dear!
Are those restraints really necessary?

19:43.048 --> 19:46.108
They are, my innocent,
naive little bunny tail.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.254
To prevent the giant beast from
running rampant and killing us all.

19:49.421 --> 19:50.683
What is this thing?

19:50.856 --> 19:52.221
A Blefuscian spy.

19:52.391 --> 19:55.189
I'm not a blue fish man.
I don't even know what that is.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.294
Will someone please just
tell me where I am?

19:57.462 --> 19:59.396
You are in Lilliput.

19:59.932 --> 20:00.762
Lilli-puh?

20:00.933 --> 20:05.336
The grandest and greatest land
in all the world. All hail Lilliput!

20:05.504 --> 20:06.801
All hail Lilliput!

20:06.972 --> 20:09.133
This is insane. This is insane.

20:09.308 --> 20:12.971
Okay, enough.
Come out with the funny cameras.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.487
Mealtime, beast!

20:38.503 --> 20:40.767
Hay? I can't eat hay.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.806
Eat up! You have a busy day
ahead of you, beast!

20:43.976 --> 20:45.102
Enough with the beast!

20:45.277 --> 20:48.075
I may be a giant, but I have feelings!

20:50.582 --> 20:52.743
I think you'll find that the hay...

20:52.918 --> 20:55.978
is a bit more digestible
if mixed with some...

20:56.154 --> 20:57.178
sewer water.

20:58.390 --> 21:00.523
I'm sorry that my countrymen
call you a beast.

21:00.524 --> 21:02.656
I do not think of you as a beast.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.089
As a matter of fact,
before you arrived...

21:06.131 --> 21:08.622
I was the tallest man in Lilliput.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.796
So I know how you feel.

21:10.969 --> 21:12.732
Thanks, man.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.538
I can't reach you for a handshake.
I'm Gulliver.

21:20.445 --> 21:21.605
Horatio.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.841
Oh, man.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.711
You guys are so tiny.

21:25.884 --> 21:28.045
Are you the only other prisoner
in the whole dungeon?

21:28.220 --> 21:29.152
Yes.

21:29.321 --> 21:32.119
I have been placed in this prison
by the great and glorious...

21:32.291 --> 21:33.280
General Edward Edwardian...

21:33.458 --> 21:36.586
for sending a lascivious look
to his betrothed...

21:36.762 --> 21:37.956
Princess Mary.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.892
That's it?

21:39.064 --> 21:41.191
He put you in prison
for hitting on his lady?

21:42.334 --> 21:43.892
Dude, that is harsh.

21:44.069 --> 21:47.266
No, you must understand.
I am of a lowly station.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.907
To legally court a woman
of her stature...

21:50.075 --> 21:51.940
one must commit a valiant action...

21:52.144 --> 21:55.341
and this is virtually impossible
as a commoner.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.210
Come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
You seem like a cool guy.

21:58.383 --> 21:59.850
You could do something valiant.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.384
General Edward has led
countless crusades...

22:02.554 --> 22:04.920
and is known far and wide
for his bravery.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.149
I'm no General Edward.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.191
Well, no offense...

22:09.361 --> 22:12.159
this Edward guy seems
like kind of a lame ass.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.593
A lame what?

22:15.233 --> 22:17.394
It is my impression...

22:17.569 --> 22:19.161
that "lame ass"...

22:19.338 --> 22:21.670
is a negative expression
from whence you came.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.738
If this is the case...

22:22.908 --> 22:25.433
you shall be thrown in the stocks!

22:25.610 --> 22:28.044
No, no, no! "Lame ass" means...

22:28.213 --> 22:29.475
great...

22:29.648 --> 22:31.946
brave and courageous...

22:32.117 --> 22:33.675
heart-of-a-lion man.

22:33.885 --> 22:35.113
Is this the honorable truth?

22:35.287 --> 22:37.847
Yes, this is the honorable truth.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.756
Then, I am not just...

22:39.925 --> 22:40.914
a lame ass.

22:41.526 --> 22:42.356
Oh, no.

22:43.095 --> 22:44.528
I'm a big lame ass!

22:44.696 --> 22:45.458
The biggest!

22:45.630 --> 22:48.565
I, General Edward Edwardian, am the
biggest lame ass in all of the land!

22:48.734 --> 22:49.723
Heart of a lion.

22:50.769 --> 22:51.793
So, listen...

22:51.970 --> 22:54.063
now that you know we're cool...

22:54.272 --> 22:56.763
what do you say you loosen
up these shackles a bit?

22:58.443 --> 22:59.467
No.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.704
It is time for your life
of hard labor to begin.

23:03.682 --> 23:04.649
Left!

23:05.550 --> 23:06.539
Forward!

23:07.686 --> 23:08.675
Left!

23:09.388 --> 23:10.446
Right!

23:10.856 --> 23:11.880
Left!

23:21.199 --> 23:23.360
Their defense system is operational.

23:23.535 --> 23:25.332
We must move in stealthily.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.401
Left!

23:34.079 --> 23:35.812
Did I tell you to
stop fanning, peasant?

23:35.813 --> 23:36.013
Sorry.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.545
Sorry.

23:43.155 --> 23:46.852
They will be too busy with the fire
to protect their princess.

23:54.099 --> 23:54.997
A fire!

23:55.167 --> 23:57.658
A fire is two bells, that was three.
It's an attack!

23:57.836 --> 23:59.303
No, it actually sounded more like...

23:59.471 --> 24:01.166
two bells, and then, a pause...

24:01.339 --> 24:02.363
and then a third bell.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.202
So, it's an attack and a fire?

24:04.376 --> 24:06.344
- The Blefuscians!
- The princess!

24:06.511 --> 24:08.103
To the castle, beast!

24:08.680 --> 24:11.205
Left, right, left, right.

24:11.383 --> 24:12.873
Faster, beast!

24:20.358 --> 24:22.622
Oh, no. The Blefuscians.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.489
Do not kidnap me.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.994
Please do not kidnap me.

24:26.164 --> 24:27.461
Why is she just standing there?

24:27.632 --> 24:29.463
Of course, she's gonna
get kidnapped if she...

24:29.634 --> 24:32.102
You speak not of the princess. Down!

24:34.439 --> 24:37.237
I shall save you, my princess.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.001
My princess.

24:43.048 --> 24:44.640
Dude, I can help.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.842
We do not need your help, beast.
You just stay here.

24:49.287 --> 24:51.517
Nobody save the princess!

24:51.690 --> 24:55.217
He'll never get to her in time.
Please, you must save the princess.

24:55.393 --> 24:57.987
But you heard that angry little
dingleberry. He said I shouldn't.

24:58.163 --> 24:58.925
I beg of you!

25:07.072 --> 25:08.801
- It is too late.
- You are kidnapped.

25:08.974 --> 25:10.441
I am kidnapped!

25:10.609 --> 25:12.600
Not on my watch.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.087
Hop on, princess.
Let's get you out of here.

25:27.158 --> 25:30.218
Fear not, my darling!
I am here to save you.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.027
Where has she gone?

25:33.198 --> 25:35.428
Oh, she has been kidnapped.

25:38.103 --> 25:39.229
There you go, Princess.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.634
Thank you so much.

25:41.806 --> 25:43.103
Are you okay?

25:43.275 --> 25:44.606
Yes.

25:45.610 --> 25:47.475
Thank God.

25:50.482 --> 25:51.972
The Blefuscians are retreating.

25:52.150 --> 25:53.913
- We are to have a victory feast.
- Hey!

25:54.085 --> 25:55.575
How lovely.

25:56.121 --> 25:57.588
The fire has raged out of control.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.417
My father is trapped!

25:59.658 --> 26:02.126
You guys got to invest
in a more efficient warning system.

26:03.995 --> 26:04.825
Your Highness!

26:08.767 --> 26:10.394
Out of the way.
I got to put out a fire.

26:10.602 --> 26:11.432
Out of the way.

26:11.603 --> 26:13.070
I'm coming through!

26:15.106 --> 26:15.970
The beast!

26:19.578 --> 26:21.808
<i>Yama-schatzi</i>, that's hot!

26:21.980 --> 26:22.912
Princess, no!

26:24.082 --> 26:25.106
Princess, you mustn't.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.478
Father! He's burning!

26:27.652 --> 26:30.018
You have served me with great honor.

26:30.188 --> 26:32.590
We need access
to a great deal of water.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.649
Do something!

26:33.825 --> 26:38.194
<i>♪ Oh, Lilliput, great kingdom...</i>

26:38.496 --> 26:39.929
I do not wanna do this.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.463
You have a plan?

26:41.633 --> 26:43.362
I have a plan,
but you're not gonna like it.

26:47.138 --> 26:47.968
Don't look.

26:57.716 --> 26:59.206
Cease, beast!

26:59.384 --> 27:01.181
- It's working!
- Huzzah!

27:01.353 --> 27:02.980
Yeah, it's working!

27:03.388 --> 27:04.616
Out of my way!

27:04.789 --> 27:06.381
How dare you evacuate yourself...

27:06.558 --> 27:08.685
on our great and glorious king!

27:12.831 --> 27:14.264
Oh, no. Oh, no.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.026
Sorry about the smell.
I've been drinking sewer water.

27:17.202 --> 27:19.397
This is grounds for execution!

27:19.571 --> 27:21.129
I know, that was pretty gross.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.898
Let me pull up my trousers.

27:23.074 --> 27:24.041
Father!

27:25.076 --> 27:26.703
Father!

27:27.679 --> 27:29.306
You look glorious.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.912
Thank you, my dear.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.388
Our savior!

27:46.564 --> 27:47.531
The beast!

27:48.033 --> 27:50.558
Beast! Beast! Beast!

27:52.303 --> 27:54.362
You guys, it was nothing, really.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.063
I saw a fire...

27:56.241 --> 27:58.471
I had some water, I released!

27:58.643 --> 27:59.871
Flood on aisle two.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.109
Does that translate here?
Is that a joke here?

28:03.281 --> 28:04.805
Flood on aisle two?

28:06.484 --> 28:07.746
Thanks, you guys.

28:14.659 --> 28:17.423
The king requests the honor
of your company...

28:17.595 --> 28:20.063
at a banquet this evening.
Do you accept?

28:20.231 --> 28:21.129
Yeah.

28:21.299 --> 28:22.926
On one condition.

28:23.101 --> 28:26.468
You free my friend, Horatio, and allow
me to bring him as my plus one.

28:26.638 --> 28:30.972
He is jailed for... unlawful courting.
He must...

28:31.142 --> 28:34.077
- ... return.
- That's my condish!

28:34.245 --> 28:36.270
One moment, if you will.

28:39.951 --> 28:41.748
Why are you doing this for me?

28:41.920 --> 28:44.718
Because you're my buddy. I'm not
gonna go to this thing without you.

28:44.923 --> 28:46.948
I'm not gonna know anybody there.
You have to come.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.217
Play it cool.

28:50.695 --> 28:53.129
The king requests the honor of your...

28:53.298 --> 28:55.483
and Horatio the Glovier's company at

28:55.484 --> 28:57.667
a royal banquet this evening.
Do you accept?

28:58.136 --> 28:59.501
Yes, indeed.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.099
- I can make it.
- Oh, God.

29:05.844 --> 29:06.902
Oh, my God.

29:07.078 --> 29:08.568
I'm forever indebted to you.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.341
It's not necessary.
Instead, let's just do this.

29:12.050 --> 29:12.948
What is that?

29:13.118 --> 29:14.745
You pound it with your fist!

29:16.421 --> 29:17.683
Come on, don't leave me hanging.

29:19.924 --> 29:20.788
Yeah!

29:20.959 --> 29:23.894
Now let's go party!

29:33.938 --> 29:34.927
Is anyone gonna...

29:36.374 --> 29:38.399
I'm just gonna go ahead and get this.

29:52.357 --> 29:53.619
So, since you're not...

29:53.792 --> 29:55.851
from Blefuscia...

29:56.027 --> 29:57.961
where are you from...

29:58.830 --> 30:00.127
beast?

30:00.298 --> 30:03.324
Once again, totally cool
to be just called Gulliver.

30:03.501 --> 30:07.494
Some people believe you've come
from the <i>Island Where We Dare Not Go.</i>

30:09.307 --> 30:10.740
Is there any truth to this rumor?

30:10.909 --> 30:13.241
No. Where's the
<i>Island Where We Dare Not Go?</i>

30:15.780 --> 30:17.042
There...

30:17.215 --> 30:18.045
beyond the fog bank.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.150
I didn't come through a fog bank.

30:20.318 --> 30:22.252
I'm from the Island of Manhattan...

30:22.420 --> 30:23.648
between the islands of...

30:23.822 --> 30:26.416
Staten and Long.

30:26.591 --> 30:29.583
This Island of Manhattan,
what sort of kingdom is it?

30:29.894 --> 30:34.160
Well, I'm not from a kingdom.
I'm actually from a democracy.

30:34.332 --> 30:36.892
You see, we elect a president
every four years.

30:37.068 --> 30:38.410
You are so honorable...

30:38.411 --> 30:40.033
and courageous.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.339
Were you the president?

30:42.507 --> 30:45.101
But of course, he was, Mother.
Look at him.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.267
He is the most powerful
gentleman in all the land.

30:47.445 --> 30:49.037
I'm so sorry if Mother
embarrassed you.

30:49.380 --> 30:53.714
No, no... it's a common mistake
to not think I was president.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.216
Were you a victorious president?

30:55.386 --> 30:57.581
Yeah. I was pretty victorious.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.017
Noble, as well?

30:59.190 --> 31:01.852
Yeah, I was super noble.

31:02.652 --> 31:06.851
I was actually known
as "President the Awesome."

31:07.688 --> 31:09.377
"President the Awesome."

31:11.169 --> 31:12.397
Pretty unlikely title.

31:13.605 --> 31:17.063
When do you return home,
noble and awesome Gulliver?

31:17.242 --> 31:19.972
Pretty soon, I suppose. Yes?

31:20.144 --> 31:22.612
I should imagine they're
falling apart without you...

31:22.780 --> 31:24.748
their greatest hero.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.476
Without my boat,
looks like I'm stuck here.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.884
Don't worry.
My army will find your boat.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.990
In the meantime, I'm sure we could
find you suitable accommodations.

31:34.158 --> 31:35.318
What you mean,
like some hay to sleep on?

31:35.493 --> 31:37.324
- Anything.
- Anything?

31:37.495 --> 31:40.259
We are the finest builders in all
the land. We could build you anything.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.958
Seriously, we are ridiculously
good builders.

31:44.135 --> 31:46.296
And we are your servants,
awesome Gulliver.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.803
I don't wanna take advantage, but...

32:00.084 --> 32:02.951
It's day seven
of my stay here in Lilliput.

32:03.121 --> 32:06.522
At first, me and the little guys
got off on the wrong foot...

32:06.691 --> 32:09.216
but turns out they're
a pretty solid group of dudes.

32:09.394 --> 32:12.022
They're building me
a temporary place to live.

32:12.196 --> 32:16.064
They threw me an awesome party
just for releasing myself...

32:16.234 --> 32:19.294
and the king sent out
a search party to find my boat.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.370
In the meantime...

32:21.539 --> 32:23.507
I'm roughing it.

32:29.847 --> 32:32.907
That is a good cup of joe.

32:33.084 --> 32:34.051
Good morning!

32:34.218 --> 32:35.185
Morning, Gulliver.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.718
- Morning!
- Morning!

32:37.288 --> 32:38.778
Top of the morning to you, fellas.

32:52.570 --> 32:53.537
Gulliver...

32:53.705 --> 32:55.866
your media room is ready.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.173
Obi-Wan never told you
what happened to your father.

33:00.345 --> 33:02.711
He told me enough. He told me...

33:02.880 --> 33:03.869
you killed him!

33:04.048 --> 33:05.515
No, Gulliver.

33:05.683 --> 33:07.150
I am your father.

33:08.219 --> 33:09.015
No way.

33:09.687 --> 33:11.570
This is an impossibility!

33:11.571 --> 33:13.482
Yet somehow,
it seems completely inevitable.

33:13.658 --> 33:16.058
Gulliver, you truly have
lived a thousand lives.

33:17.362 --> 33:20.695
King Theodore, it is time to perform
our bi-weekly military exercises.

33:20.865 --> 33:24.372
Just one moment.
We're watching the stories...

33:24.382 --> 33:25.774
of Gulliver's life.

33:25.813 --> 33:28.570
Sir, we have not missed a military
exercise in over three hundred years.

33:28.670 --> 33:29.403
Dude!

33:29.440 --> 33:32.273
Oh... get out of the way.
We cannot see the screen!

33:32.443 --> 33:34.673
Move! Move!

33:35.947 --> 33:37.744
The Titanic is sinking!

33:37.915 --> 33:39.712
But it was meant to be unsinkable.

33:42.553 --> 33:43.781
I love you, Gulliver.

33:43.955 --> 33:45.547
No, don't do that.

33:45.723 --> 33:48.055
You're gonna make lots of babies
and die in a warm bed...

33:48.226 --> 33:49.352
in old age.

33:53.464 --> 33:54.863
I'm cold.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.095
And also...

33:58.236 --> 33:59.794
I'm king of the world!

34:01.406 --> 34:02.464
Oh, Gulliver.

34:06.778 --> 34:07.745
Bravo!

34:08.312 --> 34:09.301
Encore!

34:09.480 --> 34:10.469
Wait!

34:11.783 --> 34:13.307
I'm sorry.

34:13.484 --> 34:16.317
You mean to say that you actually died
in this shipwreck?

34:16.487 --> 34:17.014
Yeah, I died.

34:17.015 --> 34:18.641
That's what you're telling us.
That you actually died.

34:18.651 --> 34:20.047
But I was resuscitated.

34:20.224 --> 34:21.384
It's preposterous.

34:21.559 --> 34:22.958
No, but then I survived.

34:23.161 --> 34:24.719
That... It's ridiculous.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.761
- Well, you have to see the seq...
- But you're okay now!

34:26.931 --> 34:28.125
It's silly.

34:28.299 --> 34:30.893
Just silly, silly stories.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.028
So, let me get this straight.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.606
After you were brought back
to life as an avatar...

34:37.809 --> 34:40.714
that's when you met your princess,
Darcy Silverman of Manhattan?

34:40.724 --> 34:43.106
Yeah. Can't wait to get back to her.

34:43.614 --> 34:46.447
I noticed you had a little
eye contact with the princess.

34:46.617 --> 34:48.380
- How is it going?
- Good, yeah!

34:48.553 --> 34:50.748
I think if things go well,
within two to four years...

34:50.922 --> 34:52.389
she may deign to speak to me.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.250
Whoa! Hold your horses.

34:55.460 --> 34:56.613
Thank God. Thank you.

34:56.614 --> 34:59.791
Now, you can't woo a lady
by hoping she'll deign...

34:59.964 --> 35:00.931
to speak to you.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.364
To land a princess, you got to employ
some grade-A court-age.

35:05.002 --> 35:06.026
Could you teach me?

35:08.005 --> 35:09.700
This court-age that you speak.

35:13.244 --> 35:15.405
Yeah, I could teach you
some of my moves.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.277
- Yes!
- Thank you.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.177
If you beat me back home.

35:19.350 --> 35:21.682
- Okay! I need a head start.
- On you mark, get set, go!

35:21.853 --> 35:23.411
I'm not ready to race you!

35:34.265 --> 35:36.927
Princess! Oh, Princess!

35:37.101 --> 35:39.069
Wherefore art thou, Princess?

35:40.438 --> 35:42.372
Hello! Who calls?

35:42.540 --> 35:43.734
It is I, Horatio.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.637
Why are you so far away?

35:45.810 --> 35:48.608
I don't want to invoke
the ire of thy father.

35:48.779 --> 35:49.905
But I must be honest...

35:50.081 --> 35:51.105
And tell ye...

35:51.282 --> 35:53.011
And tell ye...

35:53.684 --> 35:55.675
Tell me what, Horatio?

35:57.688 --> 36:00.919
You don't have to be rich
to be my girl.

36:02.426 --> 36:03.188
Say it!

36:04.262 --> 36:07.390
You don't have to be rich
to be my girl.

36:07.565 --> 36:09.726
You don't have to be cool
to rule my world.

36:09.901 --> 36:13.200
You don't have to be cool
to rule my world.

36:13.371 --> 36:15.999
Horatio, these passionate words
could get us into trouble.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.699
There's no particular sign
I'm more compatible with.

36:18.876 --> 36:22.676
There's no particular sign
that I'm more compatible with.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.247
I just want your extra time
and your...

36:28.419 --> 36:29.215
...kiss.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.255
Kiss.

36:33.424 --> 36:36.222
What beauty emanates from your lips!

36:36.394 --> 36:38.021
Think I'm gonna dance now.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.795
I think I'd better dance now.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.458
Think I'm gonna dance now!

36:49.440 --> 36:50.964
Put more mustard on it, baby.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.906
Feel it. Move your hips.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.274
I don't think it's working.

36:59.450 --> 37:02.044
You're not dancing good. Shake it!

37:04.322 --> 37:07.758
I've never been wooed
with such unique passion.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.320
It's working!

37:12.296 --> 37:13.957
Did I tell you?

37:14.131 --> 37:15.792
Yes!

37:16.434 --> 37:18.959
I hear someone coming!
Till the morrow.

37:21.539 --> 37:24.007
It worked! I did it!

37:25.910 --> 37:26.842
Let's go.

37:27.278 --> 37:28.176
Yes!

37:29.013 --> 37:31.743
To whom were you speaking, my darling?

37:34.151 --> 37:34.947
No one.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.849
Me. I was... I was speaking to me.

37:38.022 --> 37:38.852
Myself.

37:39.023 --> 37:40.923
What are you doing in my chambers?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.753
I have come to court you...

37:42.927 --> 37:44.326
as I always do...

37:44.495 --> 37:45.462
at this time of day.

37:46.297 --> 37:50.631
Or have you already forgotten
who is your one true eternal love?

37:50.801 --> 37:53.668
No, no. Of course, I remember.

37:55.172 --> 37:56.080
Remember what?

37:56.090 --> 38:00.071
Ooh, that you are my one true...

38:00.311 --> 38:01.676
...eternal love.

38:01.846 --> 38:03.336
It's just that I was talking...

38:03.514 --> 38:05.175
with the giant and lost track of time.

38:05.349 --> 38:06.816
I trust not this beast.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.385
Seems trustworthy to me.

38:09.553 --> 38:11.748
- He's very nice.
- You've done sewing.

38:11.922 --> 38:13.048
Sewing. Yes.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.384
An embroidery.

38:14.558 --> 38:17.227
It's my grandmother's doily
and I'm trying to present...

38:17.228 --> 38:19.526
I captured a hawk today.

38:19.697 --> 38:21.028
Did you?

38:21.232 --> 38:25.430
He lay in a field. I came behind him
and captured him with my bare hand.

38:28.205 --> 38:30.196
This is impressive, also.

38:34.845 --> 38:36.073
Fun.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.010
Fun courtship...

38:38.182 --> 38:40.082
you and I have.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.843
It is over now.

38:42.019 --> 38:43.816
Must go.

38:44.021 --> 38:47.684
Those villagers shan't
pillage themselves.

39:00.037 --> 39:02.733
We must alert General Edward
of this at once.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.509
We've found it.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.376
I hear you, ring-a-ling-a-ding-dong.

39:09.547 --> 39:12.175
Okay, I'm coming alr...
Hey, how's it going?

39:12.350 --> 39:14.443
Hello, beast!

39:14.618 --> 39:16.677
I come bearing the most terrific news!

39:16.854 --> 39:17.946
Yeah? Really?

39:18.122 --> 39:20.420
We have discovered your ship.

39:20.591 --> 39:22.786
The Knotfersail.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.188
Clever name.

39:25.396 --> 39:26.954
You did it!

39:27.131 --> 39:30.794
You found my boat.
I'm actually going home.

39:31.001 --> 39:33.561
Hey, you guys can
fix this thing, right?

39:33.738 --> 39:36.400
Of course, you can.
You're incredibly awesome builders.

39:36.607 --> 39:38.268
Yes!

39:40.411 --> 39:44.245
Darcy is about to read
the best article ever.

39:44.448 --> 39:46.143
I'm talking Pulitzer.

39:47.151 --> 39:50.052
"Slide to unlock."

39:51.956 --> 39:53.218
What are you guys doing?

39:54.959 --> 39:56.893
Is that my phone?
Man, it takes a lickin'.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.319
No signal, but I got 12 messages.

39:59.497 --> 40:01.761
Mr. Popularity.

40:01.932 --> 40:04.332
<i>Hey, Gulliver. It's me. It's Darcy.</i>

40:04.535 --> 40:07.760
<i>You know, I just realized why I felt
like your writing came straight...</i>

40:07.761 --> 40:09.998
<i>out of Frommer's. Because it does!</i>

40:10.236 --> 40:11.548
<i>- Call me as soon as you get this.</i>
- Oh no.

40:12.643 --> 40:14.110
Sergeant Peacock, what's it doing?

40:14.278 --> 40:16.143
He's checking his voicemail,
General Edward.

40:16.313 --> 40:17.109
Oh good.

40:17.281 --> 40:18.441
What's voicemail?

40:18.616 --> 40:22.313
<i>Hey, Lemuel! It's Darcy.
I've totally forgiven you.</i>

40:22.486 --> 40:23.817
<i>Oh wait! No, I haven't...</i>

40:23.988 --> 40:26.786
<i>because now I have to get seasick
on a boat to cover your butt!</i>

40:26.957 --> 40:27.946
<i>Thanks for this.</i>

40:28.125 --> 40:30.423
<i>And if you can't tell,
that "thanks" was sarcastic.</i>

40:31.929 --> 40:33.453
<i>Darcy, again.</i>

40:33.631 --> 40:37.089
<i>I can't believe you lied to me.
I trusted you.</i>

40:37.268 --> 40:40.101
<i>Wherever you're hiding, stay there.</i>

40:40.271 --> 40:43.297
<i>I never want to hear from you again.</i>

40:45.843 --> 40:46.935
Mr. Beast...

40:47.111 --> 40:49.102
I've instructed our builders...

40:49.280 --> 40:53.842
to work day and night to ensure
you are seaworthy by week's end.

40:54.018 --> 40:56.168
Isn't that just the most fantastical

40:56.169 --> 40:58.318
news you've ever received
in your life?

40:58.489 --> 40:59.513
Great.

40:59.690 --> 41:02.318
I can't tell you how happy I am...

41:02.993 --> 41:04.460
for you.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.205
Why do you look so forlorn,
noble protector?

41:16.874 --> 41:19.069
Me? Forlorn? No way.

41:19.243 --> 41:21.302
You do look quite forlorn.

41:21.946 --> 41:25.040
Just for the record, what's "forlorn"
mean, again? Is it like "sad"?

41:25.216 --> 41:27.650
Basically, it's just
a bit more dramatic-sounding.

41:27.818 --> 41:30.981
Yeah, well, in that case,
I guess I am a little forlorn.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.144
Oh, Gulliver...

41:32.323 --> 41:34.348
you miss your princess.

41:37.761 --> 41:40.161
The truth is, we're not super close.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.730
Oh, Gulliver.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.665
She's kind of mad at me right now.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.097
I am forlorn as well.

41:48.772 --> 41:51.036
I don't know what to do.

41:51.842 --> 41:53.776
I think I'm in love with Horatio.

41:53.944 --> 41:57.209
But that's great!
Don't be forlorn about that.

41:57.381 --> 41:58.661
Most people spend their whole lives

41:58.662 --> 41:59.941
looking for that and
they don't find it.

42:00.117 --> 42:02.108
Go for it! Follow your heart.

42:02.286 --> 42:04.413
But my heart
is promised to General Edward.

42:04.588 --> 42:07.853
And I cannot break that vow.
He will lose honor and respect.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.788
And he will die of heartbreak.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.793
Okay. Look, he's just
being melodramatic.

42:13.264 --> 42:14.925
- Is he?
- Yeah.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.230
Gulliver, I will miss you so much.

42:18.402 --> 42:20.427
I'm gonna miss you, too.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.767
Maybe I should stay.

42:23.941 --> 42:25.533
Don't you miss your subjects?

42:25.709 --> 42:27.040
And the White House?

42:27.211 --> 42:28.473
And the Millennium Falcon?

42:29.113 --> 42:30.774
Yeah.

42:30.981 --> 42:34.075
But Vice President Yoda
can run things without me for a while.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.420
Do you think the king would mind
if I stuck around for a bit?

42:38.589 --> 42:41.387
Well, of course not, Gulliver.

42:41.592 --> 42:44.117
You've made everyone here so happy.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.611
I can't imagine anyone in Lilliput
not wanting you

42:46.621 --> 42:48.432
to stay as long as possible.

42:48.799 --> 42:51.632
Noble and valiant King Theodore.

42:51.802 --> 42:55.397
I trust-eth not this beast, Gulliver
who lives-t in our midst-ith-ith.

42:55.573 --> 42:59.065
He can now leave, but he
chooses to stay. And furthermore...

42:59.743 --> 43:02.109
I do not believe it
who he say-eth he is-eth.

43:02.279 --> 43:04.611
I most-eth humbly disagree-eth.

43:04.782 --> 43:07.945
And why-eth must we always
go on with these "eths"?

43:08.586 --> 43:10.577
Because we speak officially-eth.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.848
Forget it. From now on,
even when speaking officially...

43:14.024 --> 43:15.286
we must get rid of these "eths."

43:15.459 --> 43:16.448
Official speaking is...

43:16.627 --> 43:18.618
an illustrious Lilliputian tradition!
- Whoa!

43:18.829 --> 43:22.595
Inside castle voice. Please.

43:23.000 --> 43:24.592
Forgive me-eth.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.867
Forgive me.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.670
You know, I think this job is
beginning to stress you out.

43:32.776 --> 43:34.437
Maybe a little time off
would be the thing.

43:36.714 --> 43:38.682
Who else could run your army?

43:39.049 --> 43:42.018
Our new general, Gulliver!

43:42.186 --> 43:43.847
I won't let you down, King.

43:45.189 --> 43:48.556
And I look forward to working
with you, Vice General Edward.

43:52.963 --> 43:55.227
"Vice General." Vice!

43:55.399 --> 43:57.560
I've never been a Vice of anything.

43:57.735 --> 44:01.034
I can't be expected to take orders
from that gargantuan fool.

44:01.205 --> 44:02.900
I would rather take orders
from a woman.

44:03.107 --> 44:06.201
- You are relieved.
- Thank you, Vice General Edward.

44:10.280 --> 44:13.215
All right, Gulliver,
protect against this.

44:22.893 --> 44:24.554
They have turned off
their defense system.

44:24.728 --> 44:27.424
Alert the king,
and prepare the armada.

44:40.911 --> 44:44.972
Oh, no. Our defense system has failed.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.707
We shall never reach
our ships on time.

44:47.885 --> 44:50.854
Careful now. Mind yourselves.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.784
Oh, what a mess.

44:53.557 --> 44:54.854
They are defenseless.

44:55.025 --> 44:57.118
Cease fire and ready the troops!

44:57.695 --> 44:58.525
Gulliver!

44:58.929 --> 45:00.521
The Blefuscians attack!

45:02.833 --> 45:04.232
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

45:04.401 --> 45:06.892
Please, we need you.
You're our general.

45:14.745 --> 45:15.939
Good Lord!

45:16.447 --> 45:18.642
It's the entire Blefuscian armada!

45:18.816 --> 45:20.113
I know.

45:28.058 --> 45:31.118
Finally! Our general has arrived.

45:31.862 --> 45:33.489
What's going on? I heard the bells.

45:33.664 --> 45:35.598
As our mighty general...

45:35.766 --> 45:37.996
you must lead the army
to save Lilliput...

45:38.168 --> 45:40.966
and vanquish
the entire Blefuscian armada.

45:43.941 --> 45:44.805
You want me to...

45:45.576 --> 45:46.668
vanquish all of them?

45:46.844 --> 45:47.674
Yes, please.

45:47.845 --> 45:49.073
Every last one of them.

45:50.848 --> 45:51.780
Yeah, fine.

45:51.949 --> 45:53.416
Thank you, fair Gulliver.

45:54.017 --> 45:56.178
Okay, here we go.

45:58.088 --> 45:59.953
Time to vanquish.

46:05.796 --> 46:07.627
It's cold!

46:13.771 --> 46:15.466
No problem.

46:15.706 --> 46:17.333
You're going down!

46:31.321 --> 46:33.016
Why have we stopped?

46:33.223 --> 46:34.713
It's him.

46:44.535 --> 46:45.524
Hey, dudes.

46:46.670 --> 46:47.796
I'm Gulliver.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.871
I come in peace. Listen...

46:50.040 --> 46:52.634
they want me to vanquish you,
but I don't want to vanquish anybody..

46:52.810 --> 46:54.334
and you don't want to be vanquished.

46:54.511 --> 46:57.537
Let's just pretend, okay?
I'll go crazy.

46:57.714 --> 47:00.410
You act all scared
and just follow my lead, all right?

47:00.851 --> 47:01.681
Sell it!

47:03.320 --> 47:05.288
Okay. Here we go.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.558
Unfurl the sails!

47:09.726 --> 47:11.591
Hard to starboard!

47:11.762 --> 47:13.229
Battle stations.

47:13.397 --> 47:15.331
Prepare positions.

47:15.532 --> 47:17.432
Move! Move!

47:17.601 --> 47:19.330
This truly is a battle for the ages.

47:19.503 --> 47:20.697
It truly is.

47:24.842 --> 47:28.972
Okay, so now, I'll just tell them you
were too swift or whatever and...

47:29.146 --> 47:30.340
How come you all turned around?

47:30.514 --> 47:31.503
Fire!

47:35.219 --> 47:38.518
Oh, no. That looks painful.

47:52.870 --> 47:53.894
Move!

47:58.742 --> 47:59.936
I'm invincible.

48:01.745 --> 48:02.541
Yes!

48:02.713 --> 48:04.271
Go on, Gulliver!

48:27.170 --> 48:29.968
Well done, sir! Well done! Excellent!

48:30.607 --> 48:33.405
Gulliver! Gulliver!

48:33.577 --> 48:36.102
Well done, you big, fat beast.

48:43.487 --> 48:45.182
Pound it.

48:45.455 --> 48:46.922
- Respect.
- Well done, Gulliver!

48:47.090 --> 48:48.148
Awesome!

48:57.334 --> 48:59.461
- Pass!
- That's a foul! That's disgraceful!

49:03.640 --> 49:04.937
Goal!

49:05.342 --> 49:07.776
The beast is victorious.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.277
Goal!

49:11.181 --> 49:12.773
All right!

49:12.983 --> 49:14.007
Yeah!

49:14.217 --> 49:18.517
Guys, this is what I'm talking about.

49:18.689 --> 49:21.852
Look at that.
With the billboards and the lights...

49:22.025 --> 49:24.459
it's home sweet home. What can I say?

49:24.628 --> 49:27.859
Hey, could you guys send over a panzer
division to my left shoulder, please?

49:28.398 --> 49:30.798
Yeah, north, two klicks.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.060
One klick.

49:32.235 --> 49:35.398
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

49:37.240 --> 49:40.573
Okay, just a little off the top.
Don't go crazy.

49:40.744 --> 49:44.510
And don't shave off my sideburns.
I need those mutton chops.

49:58.662 --> 50:01.722
<i>♪ I wanna rock and roll</i>

50:01.898 --> 50:03.195
<i>♪ All night</i>

50:03.967 --> 50:05.594
<i>♪ And party every day</i>

50:05.769 --> 50:09.398
<i>♪ I wanna rock and roll all night</i>

50:10.540 --> 50:12.007
<i>♪ And party every day</i>

50:12.175 --> 50:13.437
<i>♪ I wanna</i>

50:13.610 --> 50:16.238
<i>♪ Rock and roll all night</i>

50:16.413 --> 50:19.314
<i>♪ And you are my bitch</i>

50:19.483 --> 50:20.848
And I double-defeated you

50:21.018 --> 50:23.179
because I was playing and singing.

50:24.287 --> 50:26.414
You did good, though.
Let's try it again from the top.

50:28.258 --> 50:30.353
- One sec, please. Pause game.
- Pause game.

50:31.428 --> 50:33.623
I was just thinking.
You're general of Lilliput now.

50:33.797 --> 50:37.096
Shouldn't you be training the army?
What if Blefuscia should attack again?

50:37.267 --> 50:39.360
Come on, man! No one's gonna attack.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.868
Not while I'm around.
I'm a one-man wrecking crew.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.439
If you want to worry about something,
you should be worrying about how...

50:44.608 --> 50:46.701
you haven't made a move
on the princess yet.

50:46.877 --> 50:49.311
You're in danger of falling
into friendship lagoon.

50:49.349 --> 50:50.204
What?

50:50.280 --> 50:53.078
Yeah, friendship lagoon. It blows.

50:53.250 --> 50:54.615
You're gonna be like, "Oh yeah!
We're friends,

50:54.616 --> 50:55.980
it's great. I'm cool with that."

50:56.153 --> 50:57.415
And you won't be cool with that!

50:57.587 --> 50:59.578
And it kills you inside.

50:59.756 --> 51:02.122
No. No, never!

51:02.325 --> 51:03.622
Yeah, man!

51:03.794 --> 51:05.557
You got to man up and be direct.

51:05.729 --> 51:07.629
Next time you see her,
just tell her what's up.

51:07.798 --> 51:09.663
<i>Hey, what's up, sexy?</i>

51:09.833 --> 51:13.564
<i>I hope it's not too forward,
but I find you incredibly sexy.</i>

51:13.737 --> 51:15.500
<i>Never told you before but
I'm really into you...</i>

51:15.672 --> 51:18.334
<i>but I'm also into a lot of things,
so don't get too excited.</i>

51:18.542 --> 51:22.239
<i>Got a lot of things going on.
I'd like you to be one of them.</i>

51:22.412 --> 51:24.175
You see the way I mixed it up?

51:24.347 --> 51:26.838
"I want you, but not that much."
You try it.

51:27.017 --> 51:28.109
Okay...

51:28.285 --> 51:29.149
should I use the face?

51:29.319 --> 51:31.844
Dude, you know. If the face comes
to you, but make it natural.

51:32.022 --> 51:33.295
- Yeah.
- Don't make it a forced face.

51:33.305 --> 51:35.116
I just have... you know,
one of those faces.

51:35.292 --> 51:36.987
It just sort of happens naturally.

51:38.195 --> 51:40.026
My hands are sweating.

51:40.197 --> 51:41.027
Go.

51:41.665 --> 51:42.654
Okay.

51:44.134 --> 51:45.601
Well, hello...

51:45.769 --> 51:49.432
fine maiden with the wide,
childbearing hips.

51:50.540 --> 51:52.872
Yikes... yeah. You don't want to talk
about wide childbearing hips just...

51:54.023 --> 51:56.710
You know, it's a good instinct.
You're getting there.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.973
But try it again. But this time,
more smooth and sexy.

51:59.149 --> 52:01.278
- No big hips?
- No big hips.

52:01.451 --> 52:03.248
I think I got it.

52:06.389 --> 52:09.415
Well, hello there, slim.

52:10.260 --> 52:13.161
I ought to call you "potamus"...

52:14.064 --> 52:16.032
because you've got no hip.

52:22.539 --> 52:24.063
Do we have to be here for this?

52:24.841 --> 52:26.741
Take five, save game.

52:26.910 --> 52:29.140
Forget about the hips.
Here's what you got to do.

52:30.380 --> 52:31.574
You have to make sure...

52:36.553 --> 52:38.350
What are you doing in my chambers?

52:38.855 --> 52:42.655
I have come to court you, as I always
do at this time of the day.

52:42.826 --> 52:44.589
This is not the time of day
for courting.

52:44.761 --> 52:46.786
You cannot just barge in.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.862
I can court you
when I wish to court you.

52:49.032 --> 52:52.058
I am not in the mood to be courted.
I have a headache.

52:54.371 --> 52:55.998
It is your womanly duty.

52:56.173 --> 52:59.074
Section 4.2 of
the official courting doctrine...

52:59.242 --> 53:00.209
Edward!

53:01.411 --> 53:04.209
I am unsure about things between us.

53:05.849 --> 53:09.376
It be not you, it be me,
but I'm very unsure.

53:09.553 --> 53:11.544
That make-th no sense.

53:11.721 --> 53:15.020
We are to be married.
You are to be my bride.

53:15.192 --> 53:17.786
We are not in love.
We are not in love.

53:18.461 --> 53:20.793
What do you love about me?
Name one thing.

53:24.067 --> 53:25.466
Inappropriate, Edward.

53:31.241 --> 53:32.367
- Reach for it.
- One second.

53:32.542 --> 53:33.873
Okay, take your time.

53:36.746 --> 53:37.974
I find you...

53:39.416 --> 53:40.747
absolutely...

53:41.685 --> 53:42.879
satisfactory.

53:43.053 --> 53:43.781
No.

53:43.954 --> 53:44.978
Edawrd, that is not enough...

53:45.155 --> 53:48.318
to say that someone is average
or adequate or moderate.

53:48.491 --> 53:50.721
I want to be loved for who I am.

53:50.894 --> 53:52.122
There's an awful lot...

53:52.295 --> 53:53.489
going on up here.

53:53.663 --> 53:55.153
- Is there?
- Now you're being cruel...

53:55.332 --> 53:57.323
and, frankly, melodramatic.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.263
And acting like a complete baby!

53:59.436 --> 54:01.063
You are acting like a little princess.

54:01.238 --> 54:02.170
I am a princess!

54:02.339 --> 54:03.772
But maybe you should...

54:03.940 --> 54:05.771
act like a princess.

54:05.942 --> 54:07.637
- Gulliver was so right about you.
- Why don't we all

54:07.811 --> 54:09.371
just listen to the beast!

54:09.381 --> 54:10.143
Don't call him that!

54:10.313 --> 54:12.759
He's a big ugly beast
and you should know better.

54:12.840 --> 54:13.847
Get out!

54:14.517 --> 54:16.849
You cannot break our engagement!
It is a fate worse than death!

54:17.020 --> 54:17.850
Get out!

54:22.692 --> 54:26.287
You will be sorry you ever
crossed General Edward.

54:34.237 --> 54:37.764
Get your Gulliver's T-shirts!
Dress like Gulliver.

54:37.941 --> 54:40.432
You, sir!
Get your Gulliver's T-shirts here.

54:47.784 --> 54:50.184
Get your Gulliver's T-shirts here!

54:50.420 --> 54:52.513
Gulliver's T-shirts!

54:54.157 --> 54:55.988
Look at him. He's handsome!

55:26.589 --> 55:28.318
What do you want?

55:31.194 --> 55:32.559
This beast...

55:32.862 --> 55:34.329
has transformed Lilliput...

55:34.497 --> 55:37.864
into his own sordid
and rotten little kingdom.

55:38.234 --> 55:42.227
And he will do the same with
your land if we do not stop him.

55:42.405 --> 55:44.396
To save Lilliput...

55:45.342 --> 55:47.071
I must first destroy it.

55:47.243 --> 55:49.417
How do you suggest we accomplish...

55:49.427 --> 55:51.674
such a dangerous task?

56:00.223 --> 56:03.420
I have got stuff! Look.

56:06.663 --> 56:08.722
I'm showing you.

56:08.898 --> 56:11.890
All right! Welcome to
the first ever Lillapalooza!

56:12.068 --> 56:14.935
Let's get this party started
with a little jam I wrote!

56:17.173 --> 56:18.105
Right?

56:18.274 --> 56:19.639
What are you up to in the morrow?

56:19.809 --> 56:21.071
- In the morrow?
- Yes.

56:21.244 --> 56:23.644
I'm just hanging.

56:23.813 --> 56:25.405
So, yeah.

56:25.882 --> 56:29.443
Would you care to attend
the Ball of the Moonlit Glen with me?

56:29.619 --> 56:30.813
- The ball?
- Yeah.

56:30.987 --> 56:32.511
The ball is tomorrow?

56:32.689 --> 56:34.122
Right. Maybe.

56:34.290 --> 56:35.416
It's a pretty tasty jam!

56:35.592 --> 56:37.787
Pretty tasty jam.

56:37.961 --> 56:39.724
Why are you acting like this?

56:39.896 --> 56:42.057
- Acting like what?
- Why are you being so strange?

56:44.033 --> 56:46.797
I'm a gentleman merchant about town...

56:46.970 --> 56:49.376
and I have got to keep
my options open.

56:49.400 --> 56:50.102
Do you?

56:50.840 --> 56:51.932
That's what I've been told.

56:52.108 --> 56:54.201
Well, I'm not an option. I'm a lady.

56:55.278 --> 56:57.357
I know you are, and I love ladies.

56:57.367 --> 56:58.480
Believe me... Okay!

56:59.582 --> 57:01.277
I'm sorry. I was...

57:06.923 --> 57:08.083
Five bells!

57:08.658 --> 57:10.649
Five bells? What does five bells mean?

57:10.827 --> 57:12.124
There have never been five bells.

57:12.295 --> 57:15.128
Yeah? Don't worry about it...

57:15.298 --> 57:19.394
because this guy throws down no
matter how many bells are a-ringin'.

57:25.642 --> 57:28.839
Don't freak, little peeps.
This one is on me.

57:37.954 --> 57:41.412
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
This is five bells?

57:45.695 --> 57:46.627
It's cute.

57:46.796 --> 57:48.229
Edward, you traitor!

57:48.398 --> 57:50.696
How dare you forsake
your Lilliputian brethren!

57:50.867 --> 57:52.801
I only forsooked after
I was forsooken.

57:52.969 --> 57:54.960
The forsookingness ends now!

57:55.638 --> 57:58.232
I challenge you to a duel!

57:59.843 --> 58:01.333
Cool. Whatever.

58:01.511 --> 58:03.206
So, you accept?

58:03.413 --> 58:06.610
Oh, yeah! Yeah, I accept your duel.

58:07.050 --> 58:08.642
Oh, goody!

58:08.818 --> 58:09.842
Make a move.

58:36.779 --> 58:39.441
Wow, you are hard.

58:43.686 --> 58:44.846
Okay!

58:45.221 --> 58:46.347
Just...

58:46.523 --> 58:47.888
stretching out the hammies.

58:48.057 --> 58:49.854
It's a good thing to do
before the duel.

58:58.001 --> 59:01.061
You brought this on yourself, beast.

59:01.237 --> 59:02.465
Do you surrender, beast?

59:03.139 --> 59:04.902
Sure, yeah! Whatever!

59:05.074 --> 59:06.787
No, no, say it properly. Say it!

59:06.797 --> 59:08.468
- You surrender.
- Oh, yeah.

59:09.646 --> 59:12.308
Say it! Say it! Say, "I surrender!"

59:12.482 --> 59:15.883
I surrender! I surrender, I surrender!

59:16.052 --> 59:16.814
You win.

59:16.986 --> 59:17.816
It hurts my butt.

59:17.987 --> 59:21.286
You cannot surrender!
You are our most glorious protector!

59:21.457 --> 59:22.788
You're President the Awesome!

59:22.959 --> 59:25.951
And you and Captain Sparrow
defeated the Joker and Magneto!

59:26.129 --> 59:28.757
And you and Jack Bauer
had only 24 hours to do it!

59:29.198 --> 59:31.462
I didn't do any of that stuff.

59:31.634 --> 59:33.625
I'm just a guy from the mailroom.

59:33.803 --> 59:35.168
But you gave us your word!

59:35.338 --> 59:37.033
I'm sorry.

59:38.341 --> 59:39.308
I lied.

59:40.610 --> 59:41.599
I knew it!

59:43.079 --> 59:44.926
I hereby banish this beast...

59:45.600 --> 59:46.948
to the Island Where We Dare Not Go...

59:47.116 --> 59:48.777
never to return to Lilliput again!

59:50.653 --> 59:52.143
Take your positions!

59:58.595 --> 1:00:00.028
Please, Gulliver.

1:00:13.309 --> 1:00:14.537
Hey...

1:00:14.744 --> 1:00:18.043
is this Island Where We Dare Not Go
really as bad as they say?

1:00:18.214 --> 1:00:19.738
It's delightful!

1:00:54.984 --> 1:00:56.178
Okay.

1:00:56.886 --> 1:01:00.982
No little people anywhere.
That's a good sign.

1:01:01.157 --> 1:01:04.593
Hello! Is anybody here?

1:01:14.537 --> 1:01:15.834
No way.

1:01:24.047 --> 1:01:25.605
Raise the standard!

1:01:33.389 --> 1:01:34.913
Let's lose this rubbish!

1:01:35.091 --> 1:01:36.752
Lower away!

1:01:39.896 --> 1:01:43.024
Can I not walk alone in my own garden?

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:44.860
Go away!

1:01:57.213 --> 1:01:59.044
Princess!

1:02:01.451 --> 1:02:03.578
I've secured a boat.

1:02:03.753 --> 1:02:05.152
We can leave tonight.

1:02:05.354 --> 1:02:06.719
No, Horatio.

1:02:07.223 --> 1:02:09.418
But Edward is gonna
force you to marry him.

1:02:09.592 --> 1:02:11.787
I don't have any choice.

1:02:11.961 --> 1:02:14.225
Please, please.
Yes, of course you have a choice.

1:02:14.430 --> 1:02:16.489
No, you made that choice for me.

1:02:16.666 --> 1:02:18.429
You don't understand.

1:02:18.601 --> 1:02:19.625
Gulliver told me...

1:02:19.836 --> 1:02:22.498
Everything Gulliver said was a lie...

1:02:22.672 --> 1:02:24.663
including you.

1:02:40.089 --> 1:02:42.683
Oh, I'm paralyzed from the neck down.

1:02:42.859 --> 1:02:44.087
What's that? What's crawling on me?

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:46.920
Not fire ants.
Oh, please don't be fire an...

1:02:48.297 --> 1:02:50.322
I am General Edward Edwardian...

1:02:50.500 --> 1:02:53.469
commander of New Blefuscia.
All hail New Blefuscia.

1:02:53.636 --> 1:02:55.103
All hail New Blefuscia!

1:02:55.338 --> 1:02:56.965
I must warn Gulliver.

1:02:57.140 --> 1:02:58.368
State your name...

1:02:59.075 --> 1:03:00.303
she-beast.

1:03:00.476 --> 1:03:02.034
Darcy Silverman.

1:03:02.645 --> 1:03:03.942
Of Manhattan.

1:04:02.772 --> 1:04:04.103
Oh, no!

1:04:32.568 --> 1:04:34.399
I'm not doing this.

1:04:35.071 --> 1:04:38.802
You got me in the diaper and the
dress. I'm not doing teatime with you.

1:04:39.242 --> 1:04:40.834
Go find another doll.

1:04:46.649 --> 1:04:49.083
Tea! Time for tea!

1:04:50.486 --> 1:04:52.010
Okay, we're kissing.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:55.790
Gentler. Let's just hold hands
or something!

1:05:07.003 --> 1:05:08.097
What's up?

1:05:08.271 --> 1:05:10.466
What kind of toy are you?

1:05:11.274 --> 1:05:12.673
Top Gun G.I. Joe?

1:05:13.342 --> 1:05:14.832
Cool detail.

1:06:08.664 --> 1:06:09.961
Gulliver!

1:06:10.166 --> 1:06:11.861
Gulliver!

1:06:13.536 --> 1:06:14.798
Down here.

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:16.529
What are you doing here?

1:06:16.706 --> 1:06:19.402
Gulliver, you must return
to Lilliput with me at once.

1:06:19.575 --> 1:06:20.940
Forget it, man. It's a no-go.

1:06:21.110 --> 1:06:22.737
No, no... you don't understand.
Edward has...

1:06:22.912 --> 1:06:24.038
It doesn't matter.

1:06:24.213 --> 1:06:25.863
I may be a hundred feet tall,

1:06:25.864 --> 1:06:27.512
half the size of one
of you little guys.

1:06:27.683 --> 1:06:29.249
Please... you got to listen to me.
This is...

1:06:29.250 --> 1:06:31.283
- important.
- No, this is where I belong.

1:06:31.687 --> 1:06:33.552
As a giant girl's baby doll.

1:06:33.723 --> 1:06:34.917
Hey!

1:06:35.091 --> 1:06:37.184
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
and listen!

1:06:38.761 --> 1:06:40.194
Blefuscia has taken over Lilliput...

1:06:40.363 --> 1:06:42.888
and Edward has captured
Darcy Silverman of Manhattan.

1:06:43.065 --> 1:06:44.430
What?

1:06:44.967 --> 1:06:46.059
She's...

1:06:46.235 --> 1:06:47.668
- Darcy's here?
- Yeah.

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:49.134
Oh, no.

1:06:49.305 --> 1:06:52.433
She said she was gonna
do the assignment herself.

1:06:52.608 --> 1:06:53.905
She's here because of me.

1:06:54.076 --> 1:06:55.771
It's all because of you.

1:06:56.946 --> 1:06:59.073
How could you lie to us?

1:07:00.649 --> 1:07:02.549
I was afraid to tell
you guys the truth...

1:07:03.552 --> 1:07:05.702
because it was just so great being

1:07:05.703 --> 1:07:07.852
a big shot for the
first time of my life.

1:07:09.792 --> 1:07:11.259
I didn't want it to end.

1:07:11.427 --> 1:07:13.019
Snap out of it, man.

1:07:13.195 --> 1:07:15.654
You think of yourself
as this small little thing,

1:07:15.655 --> 1:07:16.926
but that's not how I see you.

1:07:17.733 --> 1:07:20.293
Think about what you've done already.
You saved the princess.

1:07:20.469 --> 1:07:23.267
You single-handedly defeated
the entire Blefuscian armada.

1:07:23.439 --> 1:07:25.236
Didn't you? Come on.

1:07:25.408 --> 1:07:27.205
I'm your best friend.

1:07:27.410 --> 1:07:28.570
I wouldn't lie to you.

1:07:29.196 --> 1:07:30.539
You can do this.

1:07:30.550 --> 1:07:33.477
So, take off that dress
and let's get out of here!

1:07:34.050 --> 1:07:35.312
Am I really your best friend?

1:07:36.552 --> 1:07:37.985
You're kind of my only friend.

1:07:38.154 --> 1:07:40.315
Sweet, man. You, too, for me.

1:07:40.489 --> 1:07:41.922
Let's go save Lilliput.

1:07:42.091 --> 1:07:43.251
Yeah, let's go do this.

1:07:44.860 --> 1:07:46.452
Take me with you, yeah?

1:07:47.930 --> 1:07:50.194
One sec. Alright... there we go.

1:07:50.699 --> 1:07:52.326
- Oopsie-daisy.
- I got you!

1:07:54.070 --> 1:07:55.799
Okay, officer...

1:07:56.005 --> 1:07:59.566
I'm just gonna borrow this parachute
if it's okay with you.

1:08:00.209 --> 1:08:02.200
You don't need it anymore.

1:08:13.022 --> 1:08:15.047
This isn't safe!

1:08:36.479 --> 1:08:38.276
I'll let you...

1:08:38.447 --> 1:08:39.641
- Thanks, Horatio.
- Good luck.

1:08:39.815 --> 1:08:41.043
I got this.

1:08:43.018 --> 1:08:43.848
Darcy.

1:08:44.887 --> 1:08:45.717
Darce.

1:08:47.723 --> 1:08:49.350
- Gulliver!
- Hey.

1:08:49.525 --> 1:08:50.787
I'm coming over there.

1:08:54.497 --> 1:08:56.692
Are you okay?
I can't believe you're here.

1:08:56.866 --> 1:08:59.130
I mean, of all the places, right?

1:09:02.071 --> 1:09:03.299
- What's up?
- What's up?

1:09:03.472 --> 1:09:05.565
What's up? What isn't up?

1:09:05.741 --> 1:09:07.867
Can we talk about the
inverted whirlpool?

1:09:07.870 --> 1:09:08.630
Crazy.

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:10.842
And why is everybody
calling me your princess?

1:09:11.013 --> 1:09:13.140
They don't. I think you misheard.

1:09:13.315 --> 1:09:14.111
I see you have...

1:09:14.311 --> 1:09:16.041
returned for your princess.

1:09:16.852 --> 1:09:19.514
He did, right there.
He just called me your princess.

1:09:19.688 --> 1:09:21.815
That's because everybody
is a princess here.

1:09:21.991 --> 1:09:24.016
I forgot to tell you,
it's just sort of a thing.

1:09:24.193 --> 1:09:26.354
If you wish to speak to your
one true love more privately...

1:09:26.529 --> 1:09:28.895
we shall cover our ears.

1:09:29.098 --> 1:09:30.030
One true love?

1:09:31.834 --> 1:09:33.768
You told them
I'm your one true love?

1:09:37.339 --> 1:09:40.672
Is now a good or bad time
to tell you...

1:09:40.843 --> 1:09:43.710
about the crush I've had on you
for the last five years?

1:09:45.114 --> 1:09:45.876
Really?

1:09:48.083 --> 1:09:50.108
Yeah, I totally have a crush on you.

1:09:50.286 --> 1:09:51.737
Is that why you always
bring the mail cart

1:09:51.738 --> 1:09:53.187
around but none of the mail is for me?

1:09:53.856 --> 1:09:54.823
Yeah...

1:09:55.858 --> 1:09:56.620
Yeah.

1:10:00.262 --> 1:10:02.662
I told everybody
that you were my girlfriend.

1:10:02.831 --> 1:10:04.264
It's really embarrassing.

1:10:04.433 --> 1:10:05.900
I think it's kind of sweet.

1:10:08.604 --> 1:10:10.595
We gotta focus
because we gotta to book...

1:10:10.773 --> 1:10:12.155
to the boat and we're gotta
get the hell out of here.

1:10:12.156 --> 1:10:13.537
We're surrounded by little people.

1:10:13.709 --> 1:10:14.471
Darcy, listen to me.

1:10:14.643 --> 1:10:18.773
I would love to book with you over
to the boat right now, but I can't.

1:10:18.948 --> 1:10:22.315
These little people have grown
very large in my heart.

1:10:22.484 --> 1:10:23.951
They depended on me...

1:10:24.119 --> 1:10:25.416
and I let them down.

1:10:25.621 --> 1:10:27.555
And I have to do this first.

1:10:34.830 --> 1:10:36.127
King...

1:10:36.298 --> 1:10:39.426
if it's all right with you, I'd like
to be your glorious protector again.

1:10:39.868 --> 1:10:41.301
I don't know.

1:10:41.470 --> 1:10:43.768
How are we to believe
anything you say, Gulliver?

1:10:43.939 --> 1:10:46.499
Because my word is my bond.

1:10:46.675 --> 1:10:48.267
This time, for real.

1:10:49.044 --> 1:10:50.944
I promise.

1:10:51.113 --> 1:10:52.171
Gulliver.

1:10:55.751 --> 1:10:56.979
You work in the mailroom.

1:10:57.987 --> 1:10:59.855
Not today I don't.

1:11:15.104 --> 1:11:16.901
We're all with you, Gulliver.

1:11:40.462 --> 1:11:41.486
Hey, Edward.

1:11:43.699 --> 1:11:45.462
If I win...

1:11:45.668 --> 1:11:48.136
Lilliput returns to her former glory.

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:49.896
And if you lose...

1:11:51.073 --> 1:11:53.381
this is what happens to Lilliput.

1:12:10.793 --> 1:12:13.091
Oh! I've made a slight improvement.

1:12:18.534 --> 1:12:19.899
Shocking, isn't it?

1:12:25.007 --> 1:12:26.032
Yeah!

1:12:26.208 --> 1:12:29.200
Hey! That's not fair. He's cheating.

1:12:29.745 --> 1:12:31.679
I've got to do something.

1:12:36.085 --> 1:12:37.279
Now do what you do best...

1:12:37.453 --> 1:12:39.580
beast, and run along!

1:12:40.456 --> 1:12:42.720
No way. Not today.

1:12:45.961 --> 1:12:47.223
I've always liked you, Gulliver.

1:12:47.396 --> 1:12:49.921
I've always thought we
had a real spark!

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:53.261
Fear not, Gulliver! I'm on my way!

1:13:22.498 --> 1:13:23.726
Gulliver! No!

1:13:24.767 --> 1:13:27.429
Now stay down this time, beast!

1:13:50.325 --> 1:13:52.623
It is on!

1:14:03.472 --> 1:14:04.496
Go, Gulliver!

1:14:04.673 --> 1:14:06.038
Yes, Gulliver! Go!

1:14:10.846 --> 1:14:11.608
Yes!

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:13.941
Go on, Gulliver!
You can do it! Get him!

1:14:21.523 --> 1:14:22.319
Help-eth.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:32.494
Bouche!

1:14:33.035 --> 1:14:34.161
Now, that's a wedgie!

1:14:34.336 --> 1:14:35.803
Yay, Gulliver!

1:14:35.971 --> 1:14:37.370
- Yes! Well done!
- Come on, Gulliver!

1:14:41.477 --> 1:14:43.069
- You did it!
- Did you see that?

1:14:43.245 --> 1:14:45.147
I wedgied him back
to the second grade!

1:15:00.329 --> 1:15:01.921
I'm so, so sorry.

1:15:03.065 --> 1:15:05.556
I hope that you can forgive me
for the way that I behaved.

1:15:07.336 --> 1:15:08.564
You're not an option...

1:15:11.039 --> 1:15:13.007
you're the most beautiful lady
in all the land.

1:15:15.143 --> 1:15:16.337
Who's also super cool...

1:15:17.412 --> 1:15:19.107
and a stone-cold fox.

1:15:25.521 --> 1:15:26.749
Horatio!

1:15:26.922 --> 1:15:28.617
Do you realize what you've done?

1:15:31.460 --> 1:15:34.395
You have committed an act of valiance.

1:15:34.930 --> 1:15:37.190
I hereby... give my permission.

1:15:48.210 --> 1:15:49.460
Yeah.

1:15:52.014 --> 1:15:53.400
Nobody move!

1:15:53.415 --> 1:15:54.473
Halt! Stop!

1:15:54.650 --> 1:15:58.416
I have kidnapped the princess. You've
been kidnapped. Congratulations.

1:15:58.587 --> 1:16:00.646
Enough with the kidnappings!

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:05.686
Bouche!

1:16:05.861 --> 1:16:07.294
- Bouche!
- Yes!

1:16:09.698 --> 1:16:11.222
Listen, I plagiarized all
that stuff...

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:13.561
because I thought you'd never go out
with a dude from the mailroom.

1:16:13.735 --> 1:16:15.794
And I'm sorry,
that will never happen again.

1:16:22.578 --> 1:16:24.876
So, yeah, coffee...

1:16:25.047 --> 1:16:27.416
I condemn you and all Blefuscians
to the gallows.

1:16:27.549 --> 1:16:29.808
- Prepare for war!
- No...

1:16:29.985 --> 1:16:31.009
you prepare for war!

1:16:32.254 --> 1:16:34.688
I got to do one more thing,
real quick.

1:16:34.856 --> 1:16:36.448
Kings, kings, come on!

1:16:36.625 --> 1:16:38.094
Guys, what is it with you...

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:40.045
and the executions...

1:16:40.184 --> 1:16:42.255
and the gallows and the stocks...

1:16:42.401 --> 1:16:43.762
...and the war?

1:16:43.932 --> 1:16:45.661
Seriously, war?

1:16:45.867 --> 1:16:48.529

You're gonna miss your big friend?

A little.

1:18:41.817 --> 1:18:42.943
- Yeah?
- A lot.

1:18:43.118 --> 1:18:44.415
Oh, dear.

1:19:02.938 --> 1:19:04.303
How was Papua, New Guinea?

1:19:04.473 --> 1:19:06.771
It was hot, sticky...

1:19:06.942 --> 1:19:10.105
and the most mind-boggling place
I've ever seen.

1:19:11.246 --> 1:19:13.806
The most mind-boggling place
you've ever seen?

1:19:14.049 --> 1:19:16.984
Okay, second most
mind-boggling place.

1:19:17.886 --> 1:19:18.682
Oh, sorry.

1:19:18.854 --> 1:19:19.752
Danny!

1:19:19.921 --> 1:19:21.183
Got your morning mail, Gulliver.

1:19:22.758 --> 1:19:23.918
- Darcy.
- Who's your friend?

1:19:24.626 --> 1:19:27.356
I'm Mark.
I'm just the new guy in the mailroom.

1:19:27.929 --> 1:19:29.362
Whoa, just the mailroom?

1:19:29.531 --> 1:19:31.362
Mailrooms are where it's at.
Right, Dan?

1:19:31.533 --> 1:19:33.763
Yeah, I don't know why
you would say that.

1:19:33.935 --> 1:19:35.425
Because that's where all the
greats start, you know.

1:19:36.104 --> 1:19:38.299
Remember, there's no small jobs.

1:19:38.473 --> 1:19:40.600
Just small people.

1:19:40.776 --> 1:19:44.371
Teeny, tiny, teeny little people.

1:19:45.147 --> 1:19:47.240
Remember I told you that?
There are no small jobs.

1:19:47.415 --> 1:19:48.507
Just tiny, tiny, people.

1:19:48.683 --> 1:19:49.945
Can I take you to lunch?

1:19:50.118 --> 1:19:51.415
Of course you can...

1:19:54.022 --> 1:19:55.785
my fair princess.
