to make it look like a suicide.

dragged the victim,

01:05.483 --> 01:09.021

as it smashed against

shortly after the last time

most likely hooked
beneath a coal car.

the need for me to search
for passenger-only trains,

damage on the top
of the spinal column.

and are bringing her
to the FBI.

36:00.826 --> 36:04.660
I’ll pack everything up.
Right. I’ll go get the car.

36:04.747 --> 36:07.614
[Man ]
Don’t worry about it.
Hi take care of it for you.

36:11.712 --> 36:13.748
Perry, right?
Michelle’s boyfriend?
Yes, sir.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.672
Perry Wilson.
Michelle’s with Cam.
She told me to wait here.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.634
F.B.I. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.
F.B.|.?

36:20.721 --> 36:22.803
Chelle’s, uh, family to me.
I’m her number one uncle.

36:22.931 --> 36:26.014
Really?
She-She didn’t mention you—
I’m also a trained sniper.

36:26.143 --> 36:29.886
Okay. Wow. Uh—
Listen, Perry— Right?

36:29.980 --> 36:32.813
You’re a red-blooded
young man.

36:32.900 --> 36:36.392
And, uh, Michelle is, you know—
She’s an attractive young girl.

36:36.528 --> 36:40.441
So I assume
that you, uh—
What?

36:40.574 --> 36:44.032
No.No.No.
Right. Because Michelle
deserves your respect.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.994
You understand?
I do. I do respect her.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.158
We were just gonna go
to a movie tonight.
Right.

36:49.249 --> 36:52.082
And if you behave any way
less than a gentleman
towards her,

36:52.169 --> 36:54.911
I’ll find you.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.916
I think we understand
each other, right?

36:57.049 --> 36:59.711
Yes, sir.
Mm-hmm.
Michelle, hi!

36:59.802 --> 37:01.838
We were just talking
about what you were
doing tonight.

37:01.929 --> 37:03.794
Yeah, we’re going
to the movies.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.422
Nice.
Just a movie.
That’s all. Movie.

37:07.393 --> 37:09.850
Hey, Bones.
Uh, you’ve met Perry—

37:09.978 --> 37:11.593
Michelle’s boyfriend?
Yes. Nice to see you again.

37:11.688 --> 37:14.896
I heard about Princeton.
You have a very bright
future ahead.

37:14.983 --> 37:16.848
I hope so.
ll/lm-hmm.

37:16.944 --> 37:19.435
Me too.
Have fun tonight, okay?

37:21.907 --> 37:24.774
Sniper. Good man.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.994
J‘J‘ [Classical ]

37:37.423 --> 37:40.085
So you were competing
with Levi for a spot
at the conservatory.

37:40.175 --> 37:43.167
No, / wasn’t.
My grandfather
used to be a dean,

37:43.262 --> 37:45.753
and I’ve been taking
private lessons there
since I was six,

37:45.848 --> 37:49.682
so my admission
had nothing to do
with the audition process.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.475
Yet, you were the only
pianist in your class.
Yeah, because...

37:52.563 --> 37:54.770
none of the other applicants
were good enough to get in this year.

37:54.857 --> 37:57.599
I’m sure Levi would have
gotten in. I mean, he was
better than everyone.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.521
He was better than me.
Did you see Levi...

38:00.612 --> 38:04.150
at the conservatory
the day before he disappeared,
when his hand got smashed?

38:04.241 --> 38:06.482
His hand?
l-l have no idea—

38:06.577 --> 38:09.410
Someone crushed his hand, Karin.
Didn’t want him to audition.

38:09.496 --> 38:12.033
He died at your apartment.
You were the last person
to see him alive.

38:12.124 --> 38:15.616
This is crazy!
He wasn’t even there
the last time that I went.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.293
His stuff was there,
but his money was gone.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.792
- How do you know
his money was gone?
- Levi didn’t trust banks,

38:20.883 --> 38:24.671
and I had this
old roll-top desk
with a secret drawer in it,

38:24.761 --> 38:27.093
and that’s where he kept
his money, and it was gone.

38:27.181 --> 38:30.969
- But his stuff was still there?
- Yeah. I figured that if his
father made him come home,

38:31.059 --> 38:34.142
then he wanted
to leave everything
from this life behind.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.016
Guaranteeing you a place
at the conservatory

38:37.107 --> 38:40.941
I was trying
to help him get In.
I picked his audition piece.

38:41.069 --> 38:43.981
I could never hurt Levi.
I loved him.
You loved him ?

38:44.072 --> 38:47.314
Did your boyfriend know that?
Right. Maybe he just
liked him out of the way.

38:47.409 --> 38:50.321
Tony wasn’t even around
the weekend that Levi disappeared.

38:50.412 --> 38:53.370
You can ask his parents.
He was at his grandma’s funeral.

38:53.457 --> 38:56.620
I’m not gonna say
anything else.
I don’t have to.

38:56.710 --> 38:59.076
I’m not saying anything.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.756
F.B.l. techs found a grand piano
at the conservatory...

39:04.843 --> 39:07.585
with bits of dried flesh and
blood inside the keyboard lid.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.011
- [Booth On intercom ]
What about fingerprints ?
- There were some partials...

39:10.098 --> 39:13.465
on the lid directly above
the spot where Levi’s
left hand was broken.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.471
We still have Karin Lin
in custody.

39:15.562 --> 39:17.518
We can get her prints
for comparison.

39:17.606 --> 39:20.848
Don’t need to.
We already have a match.
The prints are Levi ’s.

39:20.943 --> 39:24.401
Levi broke his own hand?
That’s what the evidence says.

39:24.488 --> 39:26.854
Thanks, Cam.
[Beeps]

39:26.949 --> 39:30.407
Levi... broke his own hand?
It’s not logical.

39:30.494 --> 39:32.405
Levi decided to move back
to his family.

39:32.496 --> 39:35.329
He wanted to remove all temptation
so he wouldn’t change his mind.

39:35.415 --> 39:38.282
You seriously think
that he was choosing
his religion over his music?

39:38.377 --> 39:40.663
Or maybe it was just
over this girl, Sarah.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.082
I mean, either way,
it makes sense.
No, it doesn’t.

39:43.173 --> 39:48.463
To destroy a gift like that
for a girl or religion—
it’s awful.

39:48.554 --> 39:51.967
And it— it still
doesn’t give us the killer.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.299
Wait a minute. The money—
Wh-What about the money?

39:55.435 --> 39:57.517
What if this was
all about the money?
What money?

39:57.604 --> 39:59.936
The money— Levi’s cash.
We never found the cash.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.981
And that fake gold medal
that Karin supposedly gave him—

40:03.068 --> 40:05.525
- Did that ever show up?
- Not yet. No.

40:05.612 --> 40:08.945
Cash— What if this
is all about the money?
Come on, Bones.

40:12.536 --> 40:16.245
[Booth ]
He was a petty thief
We arrested him in Bait/more.

40:16.331 --> 40:19.368
Se ven other reSIdents
in Karin L/n ’3 building
reported missing items...

40:19.459 --> 40:21.370
right around the t/me
that L e vi died

40:21.461 --> 40:24.123
There was jewelry,
silverware, cash.

40:24.256 --> 40:28.044
So it was just a robbery?
Well, the thief
was some stupid kid...

40:28.135 --> 40:30.717
who hooked a bunch
of stolen items
about a month ago.

40:30.804 --> 40:34.296

40:47.529 --> 40:51.613

Levi was ﬁghting for
when he fell over the railing.

40:51.700 --> 40:55.693
,r And just enough

40:57.873 --> 41:00.615
[Brennan ] Levi was just
in the wrong place
at the wrong t/me.

41:00.709 --> 41:02.700
,U [ Continues, lndistinct]

41:05.756 --> 41:07.621
Guess that would certainly
just/fy his parents...

41:07.758 --> 41:11.046
removing themselves
from the world.
Can’t blame ’em now.

41:12.346 --> 41:15.964
But... what Levi discovered—

41:16.058 --> 41:18.014
the gift he had—

41:18.101 --> 41:21.889
Would their god
really want them
to deny their son that?

41:33.450 --> 41:35.782
Levi planned to return.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.485
We thought it was important
that you knew that.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.913
He considered life
outside the community,

41:42.000 --> 41:45.083
but he wanted to come home.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.245
[Booth ]
We brought you something.

41:50.300 --> 41:52.837
I’m sorry,
but we can’t accept that.

41:52.928 --> 41:55.761
In this case,
I think God will understand.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.094
[ Karin ]
Levi, if you want to get
into the conservatory,

42:00.185 --> 42:02.050
you have to learn to perform.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.178
You’re amazing.
