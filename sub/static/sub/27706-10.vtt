00:20.883 --> 00:22.229
Go with God.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.941
<i>When the new world began,</i>

00:25.985 --> 00:28.277
<i>everyone had to live with
the choices they had made</i>

00:28.362 --> 00:30.612
<i>and their terrible
consequences.</i>

00:30.698 --> 00:34.241
<i>But there were
moments of grace.</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:40.664
Who are you?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.585
I'm Dr. Jonas Lear.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.962
You the one responsible
for this mess?

00:47.048 --> 00:49.298
Yes.

00:50.301 --> 00:51.301
Sir,

00:51.385 --> 00:53.177
you want to tell me
what the plan is

00:53.304 --> 00:54.803
for that gun in your hand?

00:54.930 --> 00:56.805
I was gonna kill myself.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.309
It's all over anyway.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.977
You sure about that?

01:02.021 --> 01:06.774
Have you seen how fast
these monsters can kill?

01:06.859 --> 01:08.776
There are 12 virals.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.487
Telluride has a population
of 2,500 people.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.781
They can tear through that town
in less than a day,

01:13.866 --> 01:15.824
and they're gonna multiply.

01:15.910 --> 01:20.621
Durango will be next,
then Grand Junction and...

01:20.706 --> 01:22.706
Denver.

01:22.833 --> 01:25.292
You see where I'm going.

01:27.046 --> 01:30.163
This is how our world ends.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.550
"For he has rescued us

01:33.636 --> 01:35.886
"from the dominion of darkness

01:35.971 --> 01:40.349
"and brought us into the kingdom
of his dear Son whom he loves,

01:40.434 --> 01:45.229
in whom we have redemption,
forgiveness of sin."

01:45.314 --> 01:47.564
Colossians?

01:48.651 --> 01:50.484
You know your New Testament.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.862
My name is Lacey Antoine,

01:53.948 --> 01:57.825
and I'm here to tell you
you don't get to die today.

01:57.952 --> 02:01.620
Dying is for the innocent.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.455
You have work to do.

02:03.499 --> 02:05.999
The sin has been committed.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.794
Now your redemption can begin.

02:32.444 --> 02:36.155
<i>For me, this was the best time.</i>

02:36.198 --> 02:38.490
<i>We were a family.</i>

02:41.537 --> 02:43.871
There it is. You got something.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.998
Come on, keep going.
It's all you.

02:49.295 --> 02:51.086
- Oh, my gosh.
- There it is, keep going.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.754
- Ooh, it's a big one.
- Really?

02:52.798 --> 02:55.257
Look at that. Yeah, there it is.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.009
Let me see.
Come on, bring it up.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.428
Oh, man, look at that.

02:59.555 --> 03:00.888
Oh, my gosh!

03:00.931 --> 03:02.931
- Pick it up.
- Okay.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.350
It's still alive.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.478
Not for long.

03:08.564 --> 03:10.147
That's mean.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.648
Nature's a bitch.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.275
Now you know how to fish.

03:14.778 --> 03:15.986
Does she have a name?

03:16.071 --> 03:18.238
Breakfast.
Her name is Breakfast.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.289
It's not working.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.500
Don't come in until it's lit.

03:53.692 --> 03:56.526
I see you got your appetite
back. I like that.

03:56.612 --> 03:58.237
Well, that...

03:58.280 --> 04:00.239
- was delicious.
- You always say that.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.074
Well, I appreciate it.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.867
And you also just like
not cooking.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.411
- That's true.
- I'll take the dishes this time.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.080
It's good.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.414
I'll take it.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.958
Aw, thanks, honey.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.296
Uh, we're running low
on supplies.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.632
Anybody want
to take a trip into town?

04:23.264 --> 04:26.139
Actually, I'm kind of tired.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.058
You have

04:28.143 --> 04:29.977
had her up since dawn.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.396
Okay. Sure.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.814
You know the rules.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.316
We'll be back way before dark.

04:36.402 --> 04:37.317
Ready?

04:37.403 --> 04:38.443
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.034
<i>We're hearing now</i>

04:46.161 --> 04:48.745
<i>that another great
American city has been lost.</i>

04:48.831 --> 04:51.059
<i>The president has ordered
U.S. military forces to abandon</i>

04:51.083 --> 04:53.542
<i>the Houston perimeter
after a night of heavy losses,</i>

04:53.627 --> 04:56.545
<i>when Army and National Guard
units were overwhelmed</i>

04:56.630 --> 04:58.797
<i>by a large force</i>

04:58.924 --> 05:01.091
<i>of infected persons
moving into the city.</i>

05:01.218 --> 05:02.968
<i>This is the fourth major city</i>

05:03.053 --> 05:05.262
<i>to fall since
the outbreak began.</i>

05:05.347 --> 05:07.973
<i>- Gasoline remains scarce...</i>

05:08.100 --> 05:09.891
How long are we staying here?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.269
Until the CDC helicopter
gets here.

05:12.313 --> 05:15.147
It's been three weeks.
Where are they?

05:15.232 --> 05:17.482
We should be a priority.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.110
We have the only known cure
to this virus

05:20.154 --> 05:21.611
sitting on the shelf
in our house.

05:21.697 --> 05:23.341
I mean, maybe we should just
bring it to them.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.449
No, no. Lila,

05:25.534 --> 05:27.617
the whole country's in chaos.

05:27.745 --> 05:29.745
We wouldn't even make it
out of Oregon.

05:29.830 --> 05:33.457
You saw how jammed up it was
heading east out of Colorado.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.375
<i>We are committed
to bringing you updates</i>

05:35.461 --> 05:37.294
<i>as long as we are able.</i>

05:37.379 --> 05:40.047
<i>Please be safe, be alert,</i>

05:40.132 --> 05:42.090
<i>and let's pray for each other.</i>

05:44.595 --> 05:46.011
Oh, there's Bob.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.018
- Morning, Bob.
- Morning.

05:53.062 --> 05:54.394
You get any chatter
on your radio

05:54.480 --> 05:55.562
about incoming flights?

05:55.647 --> 05:56.730
Plane or chopper?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.231
Nope. Nothing.

05:58.359 --> 05:59.679
I don't know
who you're expecting,

05:59.735 --> 06:02.152
but they might have been
detained by current events.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.445
You hear about Houston?

06:03.530 --> 06:04.905
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.388
We're heading into town
for supplies.

06:06.492 --> 06:07.366
You need anything?

06:07.493 --> 06:08.367
Bullets.

06:08.494 --> 06:09.951
I could always use bullets.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.745
Will do.

06:17.086 --> 06:19.169
Hey, babe,
I'm gonna go check around here

06:19.296 --> 06:20.337
and see if it's open.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.631
Okay.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.692
I thought
they only moved at night.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.862
Why won't these bloodsuckers
stick to the rules?

07:34.329 --> 07:36.141
Want to get your blink on this,
Agent. I moderate

07:36.165 --> 07:37.684
a little chat group that's
been tabulating casualties.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.333
I can't thank you enough
for shooting that thing dead.

07:40.461 --> 07:42.294
Well, he's a federal agent, Ma.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.481
He's probably had a lot of
practice.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.566
I thought I knew
everyone left in these parts.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.131
You must be squirreled away
real good.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.799
We stick close to the cabin.

07:47.843 --> 07:49.259
Why didn't you evacuate?

07:49.386 --> 07:52.262
Well, nowhere to go,
so we just took our chances.

07:52.306 --> 07:53.472
Once we started getting

07:53.515 --> 07:54.742
into the thousands,
I started marking them.

07:54.766 --> 07:56.433
I have a digital version
for my followers.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.560
But everything's gonna go dark
soon, so...

07:58.645 --> 08:00.103
hard copies.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.605
So it's ten

08:01.732 --> 08:02.981
hot spots?

08:03.066 --> 08:06.693
Yeah. The, uh,
Pacific Northwest is very quiet.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.279
What about Vegas?
Nothing in Nevada?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.780
No. Why?

08:10.866 --> 08:12.407
Is Nevada important?
Is that where

08:12.451 --> 08:13.909
the government bunkers are?

08:13.994 --> 08:16.119
No, no. Just...
We have friends there.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.290
We have a ten-year-old girl

08:20.375 --> 08:21.625
at home.
We should get back.

08:21.752 --> 08:24.327
Well, it is hard enough
to be a parent,

08:24.379 --> 08:25.712
but with all this...

08:27.508 --> 08:29.007
<i>They all went home.</i>

08:29.092 --> 08:30.425
The virals.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.968
The hot spots are places

08:32.095 --> 08:33.636
they're originally from.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.096
Remember, I picked them up.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.347
I learned their stories.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.724
They all went home.

08:37.768 --> 08:41.394
Yeah, but wasn't Shauna Babcock
from Las Vegas?

08:41.438 --> 08:44.397
So why isn't Nevada a hot spot?

08:46.026 --> 08:47.651
- Please! Please!
- She can't stay here.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.986
She's not infected!

08:50.030 --> 08:51.947
- We need to take her.
- Stop! She's only five!

08:52.032 --> 08:54.157
- Don't touch her!

08:54.243 --> 08:56.660
Stop! She's not infected!

08:56.787 --> 08:58.245
Let us do our job!

08:58.330 --> 08:59.496
Hey!

08:59.623 --> 09:00.975
- Lower your weapon.
- Get out of the way!

09:00.999 --> 09:02.791
- Hey!
- What's going on?

09:02.918 --> 09:03.918
She's infected.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.253
She's not.

09:07.631 --> 09:08.755
It's all right.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.382
- It's okay.
- Get her out.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.133
You're not feeling so great,
huh?

09:12.261 --> 09:14.261
Can you open up for me?

09:17.432 --> 09:19.057
She's not infected. She's sick.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.017
She had any, uh,
scratches or bites?

09:21.103 --> 09:22.352
Anything like that, ma'am?

09:22.396 --> 09:24.229
No.
Not a scratch.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.940
She just has a sore throat.
That's-that's all.

09:28.527 --> 09:30.569
All right,
just give us a minute.

09:30.612 --> 09:33.488
- The kid looked pretty bad.
- Just get them checked in.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.468
- Find them some cots. The kid's just got a cold.
- It's okay, honey.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.367
I want the doors
locked down an hour

09:37.494 --> 09:38.994
before sunset.

09:43.959 --> 09:46.084
Hey. Hey! Hey!

09:46.211 --> 09:48.253
Shut it down!
I'm not gonna tell you again!

09:51.758 --> 09:52.924
Sheriff.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.720
What's the story with, uh,
Belushi in there?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.472
Well, he's got
warrants for his arrest.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.224
What are we talking?

10:01.310 --> 10:03.852
Robbery, assault, rape.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.229
- Triple threat.
- Yeah, he's from Wyoming.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.875
Trying to get someone out here
to pick him up,

10:07.899 --> 10:10.483
but infrastructure out there
is gone.

10:10.569 --> 10:12.193
I don't know
what to do with him.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.571
- I'll take him to county.
- You sure?

10:14.698 --> 10:16.489
Yeah.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.199
I don't know.
It's getting dark.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.409
Curfew's in effect.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.494
I'm gonna be fine.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.996
Besides, he can't stay here.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.708
All right.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.876
Thanks.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.557
I'm amazed you made it here.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.392
The last three convoys didn't.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.978
We got lucky.
Found the National Guard.

10:47.064 --> 10:50.357
A lot of people are asking
why you're not rotting in jail.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.151
He knows what he's done.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.527
But he's the one who can fix it.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.488
The only known cure
was put into a car

10:56.531 --> 10:58.198
headed for the CDC in Atlanta.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.824
Well, that could be anywhere
by now.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.638
Everything below South Carolina
is getting pretty nasty.

11:01.662 --> 11:03.411
Can you replicate the cure?

11:03.497 --> 11:05.642
Well, I can reverse engineer
the virus, but I need a blood

11:05.666 --> 11:07.624
and tissue sample
from a viral subject.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.395
We have one in the morgue.
How long will it take?

11:09.419 --> 11:10.772
- I don't know. Depends on the resources.
- I'm sorry.

11:10.796 --> 11:11.898
Maybe I didn't make it clear.

11:11.922 --> 11:13.421
We're facing
a diplomatic crisis.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.881
The virus started here
in the U.S.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.591
The rest of the world
is terrified.

11:16.635 --> 11:18.468
They're having meetings
and we're not invited.

11:18.595 --> 11:19.595
It's bad.

11:19.721 --> 11:20.804
Do I make myself clear?

11:20.847 --> 11:22.472
Loud and clear.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.079
No one leaves till we find
a solution.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.536
Hello.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.413
Hello, friend.
It's good to hear your voice.

11:46.498 --> 11:49.374
Same. You safe?

11:49.418 --> 11:51.126
I'm at the, uh,
Global Health Federation.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.295
We're, uh, we're trying
to replicate Nichole's cure.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.192
Obviously, it'd be easier
if I had the original.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.632
Have you heard from Wolgast?

11:57.759 --> 11:59.134
Not a thing.

11:59.261 --> 12:02.095
Damn. Damn.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.763
You think he and Amy made it?

12:03.890 --> 12:06.349
I don't play that game, Jonas.

12:06.393 --> 12:10.145
Yeah. Uh,
I hear Nevada's, uh, quiet.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.604
We have you to thank for that?

12:11.732 --> 12:13.690
I'm doing my best.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.775
<i>You okay?</i>

12:15.861 --> 12:19.195
No. I'm not.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.240
So if you could just hurry up
and figure out a cure,

12:22.284 --> 12:24.159
I'd greatly appreciate that.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.286
<i>Take care.</i>

12:26.329 --> 12:28.621
Yeah. You, too.

14:13.895 --> 14:16.771
The CDC's not coming.

14:16.898 --> 14:19.691
You don't know that.

14:19.776 --> 14:23.319
They'd be here by now.

14:23.405 --> 14:27.282
Carla said there were
some people in the area.

14:27.367 --> 14:28.992
Who?

14:29.119 --> 14:31.661
Why didn't she tell me this?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.663
They're a group
from Doctors Without Borders.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.291
You met them already?

14:37.878 --> 14:40.962
I want to travel with them
to the CDC.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.882
Lila, this is the only place
I can keep us safe.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.327
If the government gets ahold
of Amy, it's 4B all over again.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.512
I'm not talking about
bringing Amy or you.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.848
You want to go alone? Why?

14:51.933 --> 14:54.183
Look, I don't know
how Nichole healed me,

14:54.269 --> 14:56.060
but she did.

14:56.104 --> 15:00.106
And maybe there's a chance
that my blood can be useful

15:00.150 --> 15:01.919
- in helping to find that cure.
- You said it yourself

15:01.943 --> 15:03.443
that you're different than Amy.

15:03.486 --> 15:06.654
Lila, you've heard
the news reports.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.531
It's not safe out there.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.658
That viral at the gas station,

15:10.744 --> 15:12.827
- it didn't attack me.
- One...

15:12.913 --> 15:14.829
I don't think it saw me as food.

15:14.915 --> 15:17.040
We're better together
than apart.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.584
I just don't know how much
that matters

15:19.628 --> 15:21.502
when the world is burning.

15:24.966 --> 15:28.635
Look, I have thought this
through.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.390
Amy is definitely safest here
with you.

15:37.354 --> 15:41.981
And the time we had together
has been such a gift.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.233
It was such a gift.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.031
But I have to do this.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.659
You have to let me go.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.343
Come here.

16:22.023 --> 16:25.733
Take care of him... and you.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.295
- Everything in me is telling me not to let you go.
- I know.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.464
If you change your mind,

16:48.550 --> 16:51.467
if you get even
the slightest bad feeling...

17:20.832 --> 17:24.959
<i>Then we were a family
of two instead of three.</i>

17:51.488 --> 17:53.863
Her name was Susan.

17:53.948 --> 17:56.074
Believed in God.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.619
You're not really here.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.038
Poor Susan was awfully hungry

18:02.165 --> 18:04.874
by the time
the paramedics got to her.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.211
She drank one,
she bit the other.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.962
He made a stop
at Children's Hospital

18:10.048 --> 18:12.715
before he knew he was infected...
You see where this is going?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.968
So it really doesn't matter
if I'm here or if I'm not...

18:17.889 --> 18:19.450
...'cause pretty soon
I'll be everywhere.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.557
More virals depletes
the human blood supply

18:21.643 --> 18:23.267
you need to survive.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.560
It doesn't make sense.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.020
Why do it? Why make more?

18:26.106 --> 18:28.898
I don't know.
Why does anyone have kids?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.693
What are you doing here, Tim?

18:32.821 --> 18:34.904
Are you lonely?

18:35.031 --> 18:37.009
The brilliant neuroscientist
doesn't have all that much

18:37.033 --> 18:40.368
to say to his pack of
degenerate murderers, does he?

18:43.873 --> 18:46.666
I have work to do.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.252
Need I remind you what happened

18:49.337 --> 18:51.254
to Dr. Sykes
when she found the cure?

18:51.339 --> 18:53.923
Do you think I care if I die?

18:54.008 --> 18:57.677
Oh, go ahead. Roll this boulder
up this mountain again.

18:57.762 --> 18:59.929
I'll be waiting at the top
to knock it back down.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.806
So, what, you're toying with me,
is that it?

19:01.933 --> 19:05.518
For what?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.145
She's gone, Tim!

19:07.230 --> 19:09.021
And that's on you, Jonas!

19:10.400 --> 19:13.901
When Elizabeth died, I felt it.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.738
Yeah, you were holding her in
your arms, but I was with her.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.908
And she blamed you
for everything.

19:21.035 --> 19:22.618
You're a lying bastard.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.245
So go ahead.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.205
You spend your last few days
on Earth

19:26.249 --> 19:27.935
looking down every microscope
in this building.

19:27.959 --> 19:30.126
It won't absolve you,
and it won't stop

19:30.253 --> 19:32.170
what I've unleashed
on this world.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.592
I have work to do.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.903
Can you quit staring at me?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.905
How about you stop noticing me
staring at you

19:59.032 --> 20:01.407
and you focus on the target?

20:05.413 --> 20:07.079
Come on, let it fly.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.545
You're letting yourself
get distracted.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.590
'Cause you're think... I mean,
just block out the wind.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.759
Block out your thoughts.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.427
Block out all the noise.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.262
You're the only one
making noise out here.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.139
Amy, I'm serious. Focus.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.183
Go again.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.577
What am I doing?

20:46.663 --> 20:49.330
- What am I practicing for?
- I need you to be prepared.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.393
- For what? What am I supposed to do?
- I don't know.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.960
Amy, I don't... I don't have
the answer, okay?

20:54.045 --> 20:56.629
All I know is that this is
on you. You have a job to do.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.422
I don't even know
what the job is,

20:58.508 --> 21:01.842
but I just know that I have
to teach you everything I can.

21:01.928 --> 21:05.054
I'm not gonna be around
as long as you are, you know.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.639
And the, and the world...
I'm sorry...

21:06.766 --> 21:08.516
But it's-it's a hell
of a lot scarier.

21:08.559 --> 21:12.061
And I just, I just want you
to be okay.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.355
Can you understand that?

21:47.682 --> 21:49.140
Love you, too, Agent.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.815
Ow. You're pulling.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.527
I'm sorry. I got to pull
to keep it tight.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.571
You've never done this before.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.199
I've never done this before,

22:07.327 --> 22:08.743
but I can learn
a new skill, too.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.203
Pop quiz.
How do you find the North Star?

22:11.331 --> 22:13.748
Um, you use the Big Dipper

22:13.791 --> 22:15.416
and draw a straight line
to Polaris.

22:15.501 --> 22:16.792
Good.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.545
Pop quiz.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.922
What if I told you
I saw the future?

22:25.470 --> 22:27.386
I'd say keep talking.

22:27.472 --> 22:30.806
When Fanning grabbed me,

22:30.933 --> 22:32.850
I saw something.

22:33.936 --> 22:35.978
I saw the future.

22:37.523 --> 22:39.231
It was bad.

22:39.317 --> 22:43.986
Fanning was dying, and I saved
him, and I don't know why.

22:44.072 --> 22:46.822
I think
that's why he didn't kill me.

22:49.327 --> 22:51.202
Are you worried that...

22:51.329 --> 22:53.204
you'll become like him?

22:56.667 --> 22:58.584
Maybe.

23:00.630 --> 23:02.797
I'm scared...

23:02.924 --> 23:05.383
Agent.

23:05.468 --> 23:08.010
When I get scared,

23:08.096 --> 23:10.471
I gather facts.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.185
You have a good heart.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.062
Fanning does not.

23:21.943 --> 23:24.693
You're the bravest person
I know.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.071
He is not.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.201
And all the training we've done
is to help you feel prepared

23:32.328 --> 23:34.829
for whatever comes next.

23:34.956 --> 23:36.872
That's what we've been doing.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.334
That...

23:40.461 --> 23:42.628
and braiding hair.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.720
Okay.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.722
How do I look?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.727
Like a badass.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.625
Son of a bitch.

24:26.841 --> 24:27.841
Shauna?

24:28.968 --> 24:31.093
Your dinner's ready.

24:31.179 --> 24:32.845
This isn't working for me.

24:34.849 --> 24:36.182
I don't have time for this.

24:36.267 --> 24:37.433
Yes, you do.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.268
All we have is time.

24:39.395 --> 24:41.395
You and me...
We are linked forever.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.230
- Do you understand that?
- It doesn't mean

24:43.316 --> 24:46.358
I have to like it,
or spend a moment that is longer

24:46.486 --> 24:49.028
than absolutely necessary
to keep you in check.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.613
You're keeping me in check?

24:50.698 --> 24:53.991
Because I think
you're starving me,

24:54.035 --> 24:57.369
because that's what makes you
comfortable with what I am.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.579
What do you want to do, huh?

24:58.664 --> 25:00.206
Should we have a date night?

25:00.333 --> 25:02.291
I'll sit over here,
I'll ask you about your day,

25:02.418 --> 25:04.126
and then you're gonna ask me
about mine?

25:04.253 --> 25:05.794
Yeah, I'll start.
How was your day?

25:05.922 --> 25:07.796
Do you feel as lonely as I do?

25:07.882 --> 25:09.006
You're delusional.

25:09.091 --> 25:10.966
I saved your life.

25:11.093 --> 25:12.426
And not a moment passes

25:12.553 --> 25:14.193
that I don't regret asking you
to do that.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.597
We may be blood linked,

25:16.724 --> 25:18.599
but that doesn't mean
you own me.

25:18.643 --> 25:21.810
Maybe your buddy Fanning
didn't explain that part to you.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.454
Yeah, I could fill a book
with the things.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.064
Fanning didn't explain to me,

25:25.191 --> 25:26.941
starting
with the totally unfair part

25:27.026 --> 25:28.400
where you get to live forever,

25:28.528 --> 25:30.611
minus the sun allergy,
and you get

25:30.655 --> 25:32.696
to eat food. You get to eat,
like, real actual food.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.949
I walk around all day
delighted about my life.

25:35.034 --> 25:37.910
There's a man in my trunk
that you're about to eat.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.330
Give me the keys.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.044
You're still telling yourself

25:47.088 --> 25:49.630
the same story...
That you're some Boy Scout

25:49.757 --> 25:51.048
who's following all the rules,

25:51.133 --> 25:52.591
and you're better
than everyone else,

25:52.718 --> 25:54.613
and I'm just a train wreck
that ruined your life.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.262
But you know what?
You ruined mine first.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.473
I was human before I met you.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.521
I'm gonna eat that guy in the
trunk, but it's the last time.

26:05.606 --> 26:08.315
The deal's off. I'm gonna
feed myself from now on.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.716
Amy.

26:33.801 --> 26:36.427
You wanted to see me?

26:36.512 --> 26:38.512
I want to ask you a question.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.598
Well, ask me.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.766
How many people have you killed?

26:44.562 --> 26:46.478
Ballpark?

26:46.564 --> 26:48.480
Maybe a thousand.

26:48.566 --> 26:51.650
I went a little crazy
in Nebraska.

26:51.736 --> 26:55.321
So you didn't kill anybody
before?

26:55.406 --> 26:57.364
You were a scientist.

26:57.408 --> 26:59.325
Yeah, it just came naturally.

26:59.410 --> 27:01.452
What was done to us changed us.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.495
Now we're something else.

27:03.581 --> 27:05.956
I still feel like me.

27:06.042 --> 27:07.750
Do you?

27:07.835 --> 27:10.753
'Cause I know you pretend
to eat in front of the agent.

27:10.838 --> 27:14.340
I know you're hungry
for something besides trout.

27:14.425 --> 27:16.884
Aren't you disgusted
with what you are?

27:16.969 --> 27:18.761
No.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.763
You won't be either
once you take your place

27:20.848 --> 27:22.765
at the top of the food chain.

27:22.892 --> 27:26.185
And by the way, you won't need
to know how to fish

27:26.228 --> 27:28.520
or build a fire, either.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.524
I'm just getting ready, Fanning.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.110
For our big fight?

27:36.822 --> 27:39.281
Well, I got news for you, kid.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.408
I'm not your enemy.

27:41.494 --> 27:43.744
I would never kill anyone.

27:44.872 --> 27:48.123
Let's test that thesis.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.709
...What are you doing?

27:58.928 --> 28:00.886
I'm lighting a fuse.

28:00.971 --> 28:04.765
No. No. No,
please don't do that.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.603
Bob's infected.

28:11.065 --> 28:13.607
Events have been set
into motion.

28:13.693 --> 28:16.151
Let's see how <i> this</i> plays out.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.654
Go away!

28:31.127 --> 28:33.085
Bye, Amy.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.906
You know there's more room
down the hall, right?

29:03.033 --> 29:05.075
I mean, if you want some...

29:05.161 --> 29:07.369
some privacy.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.705
I'm sorry, princess.
Am I crowding you?

29:09.832 --> 29:11.206
No. Just saying.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.708
You still want to kill yourself?

29:12.752 --> 29:14.752
- Yup.

29:14.837 --> 29:18.213
Then you and I are like
Bert and Ernie.

29:18.299 --> 29:20.007
Oh, great.
Then I get to be Bert.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.759
And you know what?

29:21.844 --> 29:24.052
- How about a little gratitude?
- Gratitude?

29:24.138 --> 29:26.722
You think it's easy cheering up
your mopey ass all day?

29:26.807 --> 29:29.099
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:31.187 --> 29:32.644
Any progress today?

29:32.730 --> 29:34.563
I mean, even if I crack
Nichole's formula,

29:34.690 --> 29:36.899
I'm not gonna put it
through human trials, so...

29:36.984 --> 29:39.234
we won't even know
what the side effects are.

29:39.361 --> 29:41.570
Bagosian wants
to start giving it to people.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.894
What does that sound like
to you?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.948
Project Noah.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.659
Obviously,
you're not gonna do that.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.661
Obviously.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.749
Now he wants
to get me on a conference call

29:53.793 --> 29:55.876
with a special UN council,

29:55.961 --> 29:58.462
try to convince them
that the anti-viral's ready.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.463
What countries?

29:59.548 --> 30:01.590
Find the common denominator.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.550
Russia, China, France,

30:03.636 --> 30:05.594
- India...
- Everybody with nukes?

30:05.679 --> 30:08.263
Yeah.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.432
Fanning's getting everything
he wanted.

30:13.646 --> 30:15.062
"And God said to Cain,

30:15.147 --> 30:17.231
"'Where is Abel, thy brother?'

30:17.358 --> 30:18.690
"And he said,

30:18.776 --> 30:20.400
- "'I know not.'"
- You got to

30:20.528 --> 30:23.237
- stop with the Bible.
- You and Fanning are tied.

30:23.364 --> 30:24.780
I'm just saying.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.950
It's not over until it's over.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.129
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey, Agent.

30:41.215 --> 30:42.798
- What's going on?
- Have you seen Bob?

30:42.842 --> 30:43.944
We saw his truck
on the side of the road.

30:43.968 --> 30:46.718
...Maybe he ran out of gas.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.428
No. The tank was
three-quarters full.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.597
That's not like him.

30:50.683 --> 30:52.391
He's here.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.934
He's outside.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.436
And he's bleeding.

30:56.564 --> 30:59.815
- How do you know?
- I just know.

31:02.653 --> 31:04.695
Excuse me.

31:11.579 --> 31:13.495
Hey, Bob.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.539
How you feeling?

31:17.877 --> 31:20.794
Turns out,
I could use a little help.

31:32.433 --> 31:35.225
Should we do this in the woods?

31:35.352 --> 31:38.186
I mean, everybody doesn't need
to see this, right?

31:38.272 --> 31:40.564
Sure, Bob.

31:40.691 --> 31:41.940
Let's take a walk.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.735
- No. Please, stop. Please, no.
- Amy, go inside.

31:44.778 --> 31:46.653
- No, please don't go...
- Take her, please.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.697
It'll be okay.

31:55.748 --> 31:58.165
I don't even know
when I was attacked.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.627
You know the part
they don't tell you?

32:01.754 --> 32:03.629
It feels really good.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.299
Oh, it's amazing.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.280
Agent.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.808
- Who do we have?
- We have India, Russia and China.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.165
Lear?

32:43.253 --> 32:44.814
Under no circumstances are you
to mention.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.598
Project Noah
or anything that occurred there.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.256
Okay, this call is
about your anti-viral

32:48.342 --> 32:50.801
and its imminent delivery.

32:50.844 --> 32:54.805
I mean, I'm close,
but it hasn't been tested yet.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.264
We're nowhere near
mass production.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.600
Imminent delivery, nothing less.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.730
Thank you for joining us.

33:03.857 --> 33:05.565
<i>Director Bagosian, let me begin</i>

33:05.651 --> 33:07.609
<i>by saying
we're extremely worried.</i>

33:07.653 --> 33:09.820
<i>Current projections say
this could cross our borders</i>

33:09.905 --> 33:12.364
<i>at any time now
despite travel bans.</i>

33:12.491 --> 33:15.867
<i>We're holding Americans
in quarantine at our embassy.</i>

33:15.995 --> 33:17.285
<i>Where can we send them?</i>

33:17.371 --> 33:19.538
Well, Dr. Lear
is working on the anti-viral.

33:19.581 --> 33:21.301
Distribution's
getting worked out right now.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.292
<i>Russia is not interested
in empty American promises.</i>

33:24.336 --> 33:27.129
<i>We want you to stop the spread
of the disease.</i>

33:27.297 --> 33:28.797
Well, that's
our primary concern.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.882
Um, we're working
round the clock.

33:30.968 --> 33:34.136
<i>Why isn't your government
being transparent about this?</i>

33:34.263 --> 33:36.805
The purpose of this call is
to move forward with a plan

33:36.932 --> 33:40.642
to distribute an anti-viral
that Dr. Lear has created.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.310
<i>When can Great Britain</i>

33:42.396 --> 33:44.271
<i>expect delivery
of your vaccine, Dr. Lear?</i>

33:44.398 --> 33:45.731
Soon.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.524
Uh, very soon. Uh...

33:47.651 --> 33:49.067
<i>We've learned</i>

33:49.111 --> 33:51.528
<i>the United States Center
for Disease Control is gone.</i>

33:51.655 --> 33:53.155
- What?
- That can't be.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.823
Is that true?

33:54.908 --> 33:56.575
<i>They were the only U.S. agency</i>

33:56.618 --> 33:57.993
<i>with a proven track record</i>

33:58.078 --> 34:00.537
<i>for mass vaccine distribution.</i>

34:00.581 --> 34:04.958
<i>Without them, you simply cannot
help Chinese citizens, can you?</i>

34:05.044 --> 34:06.460
Now is not the time

34:06.587 --> 34:09.337
to hypothesize
what cannot be done.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.922
- We need to work together and...

34:15.929 --> 34:18.804
<i>Your allies are
growing impatient,</i>

34:18.931 --> 34:22.309
<i>and your enemies are
discussing military solutions.</i>

34:23.728 --> 34:26.730
<i>Good luck, gentlemen.</i>

34:33.655 --> 34:34.946
Get back to work.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.202
They're gonna bomb us.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.683
- Sheriff. What's going on?
- Hey. They're here.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.185
They made it to Vegas.
It's a bloodbath.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.770
If we can't lock it down,
we're done... Hey.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.271
- Hey, hey, get back here! Are you crazy?
- Let him go.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.128
Hey! Are you crazy? Hey!

34:50.172 --> 34:51.213
Let him go. Let him go.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.630
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.794
Do it.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.296
Shoot me.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.506
Come on.

35:34.550 --> 35:37.008
Put it right in my sweet spot.

35:39.138 --> 35:41.138
You killed all those people.

35:43.225 --> 35:45.225
No, that was Martinez.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.353
I haven't had a drop to drink
since our fight, but go ahead.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.564
Shoot me. Take us both out.

35:50.691 --> 35:53.191
Our ghosts can have a fight
on the way down to hell.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.622
- I just want...
- You want what?

36:08.709 --> 36:10.625
What do you want?

36:15.966 --> 36:17.757
I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.639
One part of me lives out there
in the world,

36:24.766 --> 36:28.518
and the other part
is always here with you.

36:28.604 --> 36:31.521
Why is that such a bad thing?

36:35.694 --> 36:37.569
I don't know.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.907
I don't know anymore.

36:43.619 --> 36:46.369
I don't know how
to make this right.

37:30.582 --> 37:31.998
<i>Get away from him.</i>

37:34.962 --> 37:37.379
Amy, dear God, honey.

37:37.464 --> 37:38.797
Oh, God.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.757
Amy.

37:40.842 --> 37:43.009
Step back. Step back.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.679
- Get back, honey.
- I need you to get back.

37:45.764 --> 37:46.972
Shoot him, Brian. Shoot him!

37:48.100 --> 37:50.267
- Help me.
- Come on!

37:50.310 --> 37:51.590
You're gonna
get yourself killed!

37:51.687 --> 37:53.553
...Get away from him.

37:53.563 --> 37:54.749
- Get away from him.
- We got to shoot him.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.000
I really need you to get back.
Please, come on.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.418
- Get away from him.
- Amy, step away

37:57.442 --> 37:59.359
- from him.
- Amy, listen to me.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.361
Last lesson.

38:01.488 --> 38:03.113
Sometimes the right thing

38:03.198 --> 38:05.857
is the hardest thing
in the world to do.

38:05.909 --> 38:07.117
Okay?

38:07.202 --> 38:09.119
- No.
- I'm sorry.

38:09.204 --> 38:11.037
- Come on.
- No.

38:11.164 --> 38:13.081
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.210
I'm sorry, Agent.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.794
Jonas, we got to go.
They've evacuated the president

38:39.818 --> 38:41.776
and the cabinet.
That is nuclear protocol.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.737
- This is happening.
- All right.

38:43.780 --> 38:45.780
- Hang on.
- Is that the cure?

38:45.866 --> 38:48.408
I'm not exactly sure.
The only way of knowing is

38:48.493 --> 38:50.076
testing it on myself.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.411
What is that gonna do to you?

38:51.496 --> 38:53.204
I don't know.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.290
But dying's
for the innocent, right?

38:55.375 --> 38:57.917
If Fanning's gonna survive this,
then I'm gonna survive it, too.

38:58.003 --> 38:59.502
I'm not gonna let him win.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.668
<i>I don't regret what I did.</i>

39:40.754 --> 39:42.629
<i>I can live with my choice.</i>

39:44.132 --> 39:47.801
<i>The CDC wasn't coming.</i>

39:47.928 --> 39:50.387
<i>Whose life was more important
than yours?</i>

39:50.472 --> 39:52.430
<i>No one's.</i>

39:55.560 --> 39:58.186
<i>I only regret running away.</i>

39:58.230 --> 40:02.107
<i>I thought you would look at me
and see a monster,</i>

40:02.150 --> 40:04.109
<i>but I should have thanked you,
at least.</i>

40:06.363 --> 40:10.490
<i>You taught me everything,
Agent.</i>

40:10.617 --> 40:13.368
<i>You taught me what it meant
to have a family.</i>

40:13.495 --> 40:16.454
<i>You taught me how to take care
of myself.</i>

40:16.540 --> 40:18.498
<i>How to pay attention.</i>

40:23.296 --> 40:25.213
<i>How to be ready.</i>

41:36.203 --> 41:39.204
<i>You taught me how to not panic.</i>

42:45.689 --> 42:47.564
Be free.

42:49.109 --> 42:51.025
<i>I've been alone for so long.</i>

42:51.111 --> 42:53.695
<i>I have searched
for you everywhere.</i>

42:58.034 --> 43:00.743
<i>I think if you were dead,
I would know it.</i>

43:00.829 --> 43:03.538
<i>So I choose to believe
you're alive.</i>

43:03.665 --> 43:05.248
<i>It's their world now.</i>

43:05.375 --> 43:07.041
<i>Humanity is almost gone,</i>

43:07.127 --> 43:08.751
<i>but there is a place
where people</i>

43:08.837 --> 43:10.503
<i>have managed to stay alive.</i>

43:10.630 --> 43:12.672
<i>Maybe I'll find you here.</i>

43:12.799 --> 43:14.966
<i>Maybe then I'll be home.</i>
