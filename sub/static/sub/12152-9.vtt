- Angel, sweetie, why so down?

- You can say goodbye. Take a hike.

You haven't changed your mind?

Mr. Ashet, I understand the amulets
you want acquired are very valuable?

03:35.453 --> 03:38.650
Yes, that's because
they're extremely rare and powerful.

03:38.813 --> 03:41.771
- Protective amulets.
- Yeah.

- Screaming.

- See if they found out anything new.
- They would've told us if they had.

Probably just safer if we stay put.

sleep there without you.

where I got it from.

07:12.053 --> 07:15.284
Connor, we've been cooped up here
together for two days straight.

07:15.493 --> 07:17.609
Because you won't
take me back to the hotel.

07:17.853 --> 07:19.650
They don't want me there, do they?

07:19.853 --> 07:21.332
Angel doesn't want me there.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.683
They think I'm connected to the Beast.

07:23.933 --> 07:26.447
It's why you don't want me either.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.888
Angel knows we slept together.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.522
That's why you can't
go back to the hotel.

- He knows...

07:38.293 --> 07:41.012

With his super-smelling

07:45.413 --> 07:48.052
...and I don't even know what else.

07:48.653 --> 07:50.564
But he knows.

07:50.733 --> 07:54.043
And he's extremely
upset with both of us right now.

07:54.573 --> 07:56.370
We didn't do anything wrong.

07:56.853 --> 07:58.730
We hurt him.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.210

What do you see?

08:13.013 --> 08:14.890
Nothing. I...

08:16.173 --> 08:18.562
I have to see Angel.

08:23.053 --> 08:25.442
How do you know
I'll be here when you get back?

08:25.653 --> 08:28.611
Aren't you afraid I'm gonna run off
and join the demon?

08:30.133 --> 08:32.203
I trust you, Connor.

08:36.852 --> 08:38.525
I don't trust him.

08:38.693 --> 08:41.412
You can't say that.
Connor hasn't done anything wrong.

You forgetting Angel's
voyage to the bottom of the sea?

08:44.293 --> 08:47.569
Charles, the little girl in that
white room was evil. I felt it.

08:47.733 --> 08:50.611
- When she said...
- "The answer is among you."

08:50.773 --> 08:52.968
Who else could
Creepylocks be talking about?

08:53.333 --> 08:55.449
It was probably a mind game
to get the Beast...

08:55.613 --> 08:58.332
...to come after us instead of her.
- That's another thing.

08:58.493 --> 09:00.563
Connor's gone
toe-to-toe with him twice...

09:00.733 --> 09:03.452
...and barely needed a boo-boo kiss.
That's not suspicious?

09:03.613 --> 09:06.446
Most of us have encountered
the demon twice. We're still here.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.363
Well, there's one thing I can decrypt.

09:17.053 --> 09:19.647
My sources have confirmed
that without the little girl...

09:19.813 --> 09:21.883
...the earthly contingent
of Wolfram and Hart...

09:22.053 --> 09:24.851
...is cut off from the senior partners,
effectively neutralized.

09:25.293 --> 09:28.251
However, it appears that
was not her only function.

09:28.413 --> 09:31.769
I've found an entry in Rheinhardt's
Compendium for that same little girl.

09:31.933 --> 09:34.845
Or, rather,
the entity presenting itself as one.

09:35.053 --> 09:36.805
Her name is Mesektet.

09:37.373 --> 09:39.933
- I figured Tiffany or Brandy.
- So Wolfram and Hart...

09:40.093 --> 09:42.527
...was just a day job.
- Sort of.

09:42.733 --> 09:46.487
You see, Mesektet was one of five
enormously powerful beings...

09:46.653 --> 09:49.406
...which are linked to
an embodiment of the ancient god Ra.

09:49.573 --> 09:53.122
Which makes them totems, right?
Symbolic manifestations.

09:53.293 --> 09:56.842
Yes. Totems which, together,
form an order called the Ra-Tet.

09:57.213 --> 09:59.488
Must be big. Never heard of them.

09:59.693 --> 10:03.572
Their origins have been shrouded
in mystery since the dawn of time.

10:04.173 --> 10:06.926
Only the totems themselves
know their true purpose.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.086
So maybe he killed this Mesektet...

10:10.293 --> 10:12.124
...for another reason.
I'll hit the Net.

- Charles, you wanna update Angel?
- Mr. Do-Not-Disturb?

10:14.973 --> 10:17.931
Doubt it. Don't know why
we're bothering with the Ra-Ra's.

- The m.o. Doesn't match.

14:13.293 --> 14:15.807
Like I was just scratching
at the surface of something.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.643
- Maybe it'll come to me.
- So, what did the demon say?

14:23.093 --> 14:25.971
Don't know.
All I got was a visual.

14:26.173 --> 14:28.562
- Not much to go on, Cordy.
- But it's something.

14:28.733 --> 14:33.249
A vision means the phone lines between
us and the Powers That Be are still open.

14:33.733 --> 14:37.408
- Maybe they'll send us a clue.
- As if somebody is up there watching.

14:37.853 --> 14:40.048
I was.

14:40.253 --> 14:43.404
But I'm back now. So you're gonna
have to suck it up and deal...

14:43.613 --> 14:45.251
...because things are going to hell.

14:45.453 --> 14:48.365
And you're the leader.

14:50.893 --> 14:52.485
So lead.

14:52.653 --> 14:56.328
The Powers are sending us a
wake-up call, people. Sure, we've been...

14:56.493 --> 14:59.724
I don't want to say demolished.

14:59.893 --> 15:03.772
Beaten. And sure,
it's slightly demoralizing...

15:03.933 --> 15:06.208
...but from here on out,
we're on the offensive.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.927
We'll find out its weaknesses,
we'll go in prepared...

15:09.133 --> 15:10.964
...and we're gonna fight smart.

15:11.853 --> 15:13.491
It's time to take down the Beast.

15:15.853 --> 15:18.925
We're all behind you,
Angel, a hundred percent.

15:19.093 --> 15:22.529
But how can we be prepared
when there's nothing on this thing?

15:22.693 --> 15:24.445
Yeah, and weaknesses?

15:24.653 --> 15:27.372
It's not a sure bet
El Destructo has any.

15:27.573 --> 15:29.962
- Everyone has an Achilles' heel.
- Until we find his...

15:30.133 --> 15:32.647
...we'll be cooling ours.
We got nothing without a new lead.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.128
- Gwen.
- Hi there.

15:42.373 --> 15:44.762
Long time, no hand-to-hand.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.451
- I remember you.
- That guy you killed?

15:51.613 --> 15:53.444
Yeah, that's him.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.406
Kicked you in the face too,
didn't I, cherry?

15:56.613 --> 15:59.650
Sorry about that,
I really do try to avoid contact.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.606
Mostly.

16:01.773 --> 16:04.446
- Cordelia, this is...
- I know who she is.

16:04.973 --> 16:07.965
Caught your show on the Omniscient
Higher Plane Channel. Thanks.

16:08.133 --> 16:11.170
So you're the girl who makes
his heart go pitter-pat.

16:11.773 --> 16:14.082
Figuratively, at least.

16:14.253 --> 16:17.882
- You must be so happy.
- I am...

16:18.213 --> 16:21.728
...not having the best week, honestly.
- Tell me about it.

16:21.893 --> 16:25.647
I mean, really,
tell me, freak to freak.

16:25.813 --> 16:27.485
Is the world about to end, or what?

16:28.573 --> 16:31.724
- Something happen to you?
- Met with a client last night...

16:31.933 --> 16:35.562
...in the oil fields, which is odd,
because I bagged for this guy six years.

16:35.853 --> 16:37.764
Big money.
He never wanted to meet before.

16:37.933 --> 16:40.128
Fascinating as these
details must seem to you...

16:40.293 --> 16:43.046
...we're dealing with much more
important stuff right now.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.483
Apocalypse. End of the world.

16:45.813 --> 16:48.168
Also, while we were talking...

16:48.373 --> 16:51.843
...he got his chest punched out by
a big demon with a head made of rock.

16:54.333 --> 16:58.246
Demon, okay? The whole nine.
Cloven feet and horns and teeth and...

17:00.053 --> 17:02.487
He wasn't wearing lam <i>e</i>, though.

17:02.653 --> 17:05.804
The evil ones can't pull it off.
It gets camp.

17:06.413 --> 17:09.723
This client of yours.
Was anything removed from the body?

17:11.173 --> 17:12.925
Didn't see.

17:13.613 --> 17:16.047
But you are hands down
the weirdest person I know...

17:16.213 --> 17:18.681
...so I figured I'd
ask you what's going on.

17:18.853 --> 17:20.286
FRED:
Um, excuse me.

17:20.492 --> 17:23.565
Not that I don't still bear
a grudge against you, because I do...

17:23.733 --> 17:27.042
...but your client didn't happen to be
a skinless saber-toothed tiger...

17:27.213 --> 17:29.169
...or composed
entirely of light, maybe?

17:29.373 --> 17:30.726
Light came out of his chest.

17:30.893 --> 17:33.009
- How did you know?
- A pattern. That's three.

17:33.213 --> 17:34.965
- He's killing the Ra-Tet.
GWEN: What's that?

17:35.133 --> 17:36.691
A mystical order.

17:36.853 --> 17:41.131
Each totem representing
a stage in Ra's journey across the sky.

17:41.453 --> 17:45.241
Here's your client.
Two others, these...

17:45.413 --> 17:46.971
...are dead.

17:47.133 --> 17:50.682
That means there's two totems left.
Manjet and Semkhet.

17:50.853 --> 17:55.290
The last sighting of Manjet was
rumored two years ago in Belize.

17:55.453 --> 17:58.763
And Semkhet is said to live
in a cave in Death Valley.

17:58.973 --> 18:03.285
Then that's easy. All we have to do
is find Semkhet and protect him.

18:03.493 --> 18:04.972
LORNE:
Well, won't that be a hoot.

18:05.173 --> 18:08.563
Looks like Semkhet is puddy-tat
to the world's scariest 6-year-old.

18:08.733 --> 18:11.008
- It could be dangerous.
- I'll take Gwen.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.968
Gee, I feel all warm inside.

18:14.173 --> 18:16.129
- Shouldn't we all go...?
- We can handle it.

18:16.333 --> 18:19.086
The super powers?
I'll catch her up on the drive.

18:19.293 --> 18:21.966
It's a four-hour trip.
Both ways.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.648
I'm sure we'll find
something to talk about.

18:34.213 --> 18:38.570
GWEN: Jeez! Where were you when they
taught stealth in super-power school?

18:46.133 --> 18:48.772
- I did that on purpose.
- That's pretty pathetic.

18:48.933 --> 18:51.686
If it's a lie or if it's the truth?

19:02.213 --> 19:05.808
- Aren't we here to protect this thing?
- We are, unless it's evil.

19:05.973 --> 19:09.966
I say if it is, we prevent the Beast
from killing it by killing it ourselves.

19:15.693 --> 19:18.287
So much for protecting it.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.922
Looks like it was ripped apart.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.448
Charring around the edges.

19:24.693 --> 19:27.253
This is definitely our guy.

19:27.413 --> 19:30.405
The Beast is systematically
executing these totems.

19:31.373 --> 19:33.807
- Just don't know why.
MAN: I do.

19:35.773 --> 19:37.286
He's gonna turn out the sun.

19:45.013 --> 19:47.004
What are you doing here?

19:47.173 --> 19:49.971
Standing in the remains
of my fallen brethren...

19:50.133 --> 19:52.601
...trying not to have
an anxiety attack.

19:52.893 --> 19:55.453
- Who are you two?
- I'm Angel, that's Gwen.

19:55.613 --> 19:58.685
- You got a name?
- I am Manjet...

19:58.853 --> 20:02.687
...Sacred Guardian of the Shen,
Keeper of the Orb of Ma'at...

20:02.853 --> 20:04.844
...and Devotee of Light.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.803
Off hours, I like Manny.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.284
- You're Manjet?
- Right.

20:13.933 --> 20:16.766
- The last totem of the Ra-Tet?
- Right.

20:16.973 --> 20:20.283
- I thought you were in Belize.
- Was, till I heard Mesektet got whacked.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.445
Never liked that chick.
Evil, right down to her Mary Janes.

20:23.613 --> 20:26.446
But family...
What are you gonna do?

20:26.653 --> 20:29.292
What did you mean?
The Beast is gonna "turn out the sun"?

20:29.493 --> 20:32.132
- Is that a metaphor?
- Sorry, I don't speak "college boy."

20:32.293 --> 20:34.853
I said what I meant.
This Beast you're talking about...

20:35.013 --> 20:37.971
...he's looking for a way
to put an end to daylight.

20:38.133 --> 20:42.206
He wants to
blot out the sun permanently.

20:44.093 --> 20:46.812
So once the totems are dead,
the sun disappears?

20:46.973 --> 20:50.966
Not disappears, exactly.
And it's not just killing us either.

20:51.133 --> 20:56.253
There's props and a ritual
and a chant and a thing and a...

20:56.413 --> 20:58.244
Suffice to say, it ain't easy.

20:58.813 --> 21:01.691
And folks in the Ra-Tet,
they got some serious juice...

21:01.853 --> 21:04.492
...which is why I never
felt worried before.

21:05.253 --> 21:09.132
- But you're worried now.
- Well, there's four out of five down.

21:09.653 --> 21:12.929
Let's just say I'm not looking
forward to my retirement in Boca.

21:13.093 --> 21:15.653
So the lights go out. Then what?

21:15.813 --> 21:18.885
The city sinks into
never-ending darkness, that's what.

21:19.093 --> 21:21.243
Vamps, creepies, crawlies.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.371
Things that go bump in the night
are suddenly bumping 24/7.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.969
- The whole of Los Angeles turns into a...
- A demon playground.

21:28.173 --> 21:31.882
Bingo. And that's before
it starts to spread.

21:32.053 --> 21:34.851
California, North America.
Eventually...

21:35.013 --> 21:37.004
...hello, global blackout.

21:37.173 --> 21:39.607
The world is the devil's oyster.

21:39.853 --> 21:43.892
- Well, we gotta stop him.
- You sure do. And good luck with that.

21:44.093 --> 21:45.606
Whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?

21:45.773 --> 21:50.210
Look, it's probably just a few hours
till this guy catches up with me.

21:50.413 --> 21:54.247
I wanna spend my last moments with
my oldest, dearest friends down at...

21:54.413 --> 21:56.973
...the Pink Pony Lounge.

21:57.413 --> 22:00.485
I'll buy you a lap dance
if I can watch.

22:00.693 --> 22:02.809
Forget that.
We can take you somewhere safe.

22:02.973 --> 22:06.443
- We can protect you.
- Right. Super Hunk and Spandexia.

22:06.653 --> 22:10.282
This thing takes out Mesektet,
and you two are gonna protect me?

22:10.493 --> 22:12.609
I don't see anybody else
lined up for the job.

22:17.413 --> 22:20.371
You think
she'd give me a lap dance?

22:26.613 --> 22:29.127
- Any movement from the Beast?
- Not a peep.

22:29.293 --> 22:32.763
Just trying to find ways to kill him.
Which, by the way, there aren't any.

22:34.293 --> 22:36.363
That doesn't look like Semkhet.

22:36.573 --> 22:39.849
Semkhet's not available,
sweetheart. Slight case of being...

22:40.013 --> 22:42.368
...ripped open to death in a cave.

22:42.573 --> 22:46.771
Don't suppose I could interest you
in a short, stocky orb-keeper?

22:47.693 --> 22:50.127
Guys, I'd like you to meet Manny...

22:50.293 --> 22:53.603
...the last totem of the Ra-Tet.

22:53.813 --> 22:55.087
This...

22:55.253 --> 22:59.724
...is a being of supreme power?
- You ought to see me in my Armani.

22:59.893 --> 23:01.770
What happened
to the second-to-last one?

23:01.973 --> 23:04.441
Somebody already
ripped out the toy surprise.

23:06.453 --> 23:08.762
Good news is,
we discovered the Beast's plan.

23:08.973 --> 23:13.251
- Which is?
- To blot out the sun for all of eternity.

23:13.413 --> 23:16.644
- You guys got a john?
- Right back there.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.242
Thanks, pal.

23:27.493 --> 23:30.610
Why did the small, yucky man say that?
He's joking, right?

23:30.813 --> 23:33.486
Apparently there's a ritual
using members of the Ra-Tet...

23:33.653 --> 23:35.086
...to change day into night.

23:35.773 --> 23:37.604
Forever.

23:38.773 --> 23:41.082
As far as evil plans go,
it doesn't suck.

23:41.293 --> 23:43.170
ANGEL:
He's killed four of the five so far.

23:43.333 --> 23:46.166
I figure we keep Manny safe,
the lights stay on long enough...

23:46.333 --> 23:48.164
...and we find a way
to defeat the thing.

23:48.333 --> 23:52.121
But where are we gonna hide him?
We need a small, controlled space.

23:52.293 --> 23:55.649
- Secure the perimeter, guards at all times.
- Kitchen's got a meat locker.

23:55.813 --> 23:59.010
Brilliant. Store the one thing
that'll stave off perpetual darkness...

23:59.173 --> 24:01.209
...in the home of the people
the demon knows.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.410
You know what?
You got a better idea, Einstein?

24:05.053 --> 24:06.884
Give me time.

24:07.053 --> 24:09.248
- I know a place.
CORDELIA: Great.

24:09.453 --> 24:12.126
As long as it's not some
nondescript tenement downtown...

24:12.293 --> 24:15.603
...with discarded boxes in the
stairwells and peeling plaster and...

24:15.773 --> 24:17.445
The faint odor of dead people.

24:17.613 --> 24:20.081
You didn't have to come
if you didn't want to.

24:20.253 --> 24:23.882
But what if I have another vision?
Better I be with you, right?

24:24.093 --> 24:27.210
Rather be here than at the hotel,
plowing through annoying books...

24:27.373 --> 24:29.933
...with the "symbolic manifestos"
and the "Brilliant!"

24:30.093 --> 24:32.812
MANNY: Never trust the books
or the bookies, kid.

24:32.973 --> 24:35.851
Real juju takes place on the q.t.

24:36.533 --> 24:40.731
That's why you can't find this Beast.
He's too powerful.

24:40.893 --> 24:43.123
- I mean, taking out the Ra-Tet...
GUNN: Speaking of...

24:43.293 --> 24:46.285
...ain't you Tet folks supposed to be
all mighty and colossal?

24:46.453 --> 24:50.412
"The midday totem is man.
The neutral totem.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.609
The potential of every human soul."

24:52.893 --> 24:55.771
So you're just a guy, then?

24:55.933 --> 24:59.892
There's more to me than meets the eye.
For example, I'm immortal.

25:00.053 --> 25:02.521
Unless I'm
ritually murdered, of course.

25:02.693 --> 25:04.604
Well, it's too bad we came here, then.

25:04.813 --> 25:09.204
Because if you're gonna be ritually
murdered, it'll probably be in a hellhole...

25:09.933 --> 25:11.332
...like this.

25:11.493 --> 25:13.245
Come on in.

25:18.293 --> 25:21.410
My butler's already in Tahiti,
so we're on our own here.

25:21.573 --> 25:25.885
I'll hit the kitchen for supplies later,
if I can just, well, find the kitchen.

25:26.093 --> 25:30.245
The Axis of Pythia, that thing
I used to find you on the higher plane?

25:30.413 --> 25:33.211
It's worth $33 million.

25:33.373 --> 25:35.284
I gave it back to Gwen
when I was done.

25:35.453 --> 25:37.683
Let's get you set up in the study.

25:47.173 --> 25:49.368
I never pass up a good clich <i>e</i>.

25:52.573 --> 25:53.892
It's a panic room too.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.772
Twelve inches of solid steel,
its own ventilation system.

25:56.933 --> 25:58.207
Homey.

25:59.133 --> 26:00.452
You should be safe here.

26:00.613 --> 26:04.003
Don't worry, I ain't
expecting any miracles.

26:04.173 --> 26:07.643
So, guard duty. What do you think?
You and me, first shift?

26:07.813 --> 26:11.044
Wouldn't it make more sense to split up?
One super power per shift?

26:11.213 --> 26:14.171
That way, if horn boy shows up,
we mortals might stand a chance.

26:14.333 --> 26:17.131
- Makes sense to me.
- Okay, then, I'll take Denzel.

26:17.293 --> 26:18.646
GUNN:
Actually, it's "Gunn."

26:18.813 --> 26:21.168
Not that I mind the freakishly
accurate comparison.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.925
But keep your hands to yourself.

26:23.093 --> 26:26.563
Four hours on, four off. Bunk down
off-duty, get as much sleep as we can.

26:26.733 --> 26:28.086
We're already tired.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.448
Got a long few days ahead of us.

26:32.653 --> 26:36.441
Hey, Gwen, don't suppose
this joint's got Skinemax?

26:42.253 --> 26:44.892
GWEN: So then after the second
gardener and the fourth nanny...

26:45.053 --> 26:46.964
...I got sent to the Academy.

26:51.533 --> 26:55.048
Something tells me my origin story
isn't enough to fascinate you.

26:55.213 --> 26:59.684
Oh, no, it is.
I was just... Just thinking.

26:59.853 --> 27:03.323
Gunn, I already apologized for killing you.
What more do you want, a wake?

27:03.493 --> 27:05.245
It isn't that.

27:06.413 --> 27:09.405
Then it's the English guy, isn't it?

27:09.573 --> 27:12.292
I saw the way he looked at your girl.

27:12.453 --> 27:15.047
A good thief
is a master of body language.

27:15.213 --> 27:18.569
He starts talking with his body,
he's gonna have a serious problem.

27:18.733 --> 27:20.052
I'm surprised.

27:20.213 --> 27:24.604
A few months ago, she was ready
to wear sackcloth and ashes for you.

27:27.973 --> 27:29.645
When did the landscape change?

27:31.773 --> 27:33.092
Long story.

27:33.933 --> 27:35.685
[DOOR OPENS]

27:36.413 --> 27:37.766
- How's Manny?
GUNN: Fine.

27:37.933 --> 27:40.367
Gave him some magazines
to keep him occupied.

27:40.533 --> 27:43.001
Swimsuit edition.
He's occupied.

27:43.173 --> 27:46.324
Come on.
Show you where you can crash.

27:56.213 --> 28:00.729
So all this time alone together...

28:01.733 --> 28:03.883
...could be good for us.

28:05.893 --> 28:08.202
Maybe we should talk.

28:13.813 --> 28:15.963
Maybe we shouldn't.

28:17.893 --> 28:19.849
Valid point.

28:32.013 --> 28:33.332
Angel, get up.

28:33.493 --> 28:35.688
Cordy. Cordy, come on,
snap out of it.

28:35.853 --> 28:37.172
Jeez! I'm awake.

28:37.333 --> 28:39.369
What are you doing,
falling asleep on watch?

28:39.533 --> 28:41.091
- I wasn't...
- What's happening?

28:41.253 --> 28:42.845
...asleep.

28:43.293 --> 28:44.282
Manny.

28:51.253 --> 28:56.281
- It got him.
- Ugh, You think?

29:00.493 --> 29:04.725
So was that one of Manny's powers?
Extra blood and guts?

29:04.893 --> 29:07.487
Because, I mean, that's a lot
of blood and guts in there.

29:07.653 --> 29:09.644
No way all that
came out of a normal guy.

29:09.813 --> 29:12.725
That was the Beast.
It was looking for something Manny had.

29:12.893 --> 29:14.884
How do you know?

29:15.053 --> 29:16.771
Emptied out his head to find it.

29:16.973 --> 29:17.962
Ugh.

29:18.173 --> 29:21.165
Wait. Manny said he was
an orb-keeper, right?

29:21.333 --> 29:22.686
Maybe he kept an orb.

29:22.853 --> 29:24.684
- In his head?
- Where do you keep yours?

29:24.853 --> 29:26.571
ANGEL:
Hold on a second.

29:28.293 --> 29:30.045
- She's right.
- Of course.

29:30.213 --> 29:31.771
Semkhet, the demon in the cave.

29:31.933 --> 29:34.572
You said someone already
pulled out the toy surprise.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.610
Did I?

29:36.773 --> 29:38.729
It's pulling something out
of these totems.

29:38.893 --> 29:40.770
And you knew that.

29:42.293 --> 29:44.807
Something you're not telling me, Gwen?

29:47.413 --> 29:49.688
All right. My client?

29:49.853 --> 29:51.809
The Beast grabbed something
out of him too.

29:51.973 --> 29:53.531
A little, metal boxy thing.

29:53.693 --> 29:55.365
You neglected to mention this fact.

29:55.533 --> 29:57.524
I thought the box
might be worth something.

29:57.693 --> 30:00.765
Look, the apocalypse was coming,
there was a giant killer demon.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.286
I panicked.

30:02.453 --> 30:05.570
I'm still a thief, and as a rule,
we don't share information.

30:05.733 --> 30:07.246
GUNN:
Okay, what about this cave demon?

30:07.413 --> 30:09.643
Think the big ugly went
hunting inside of him?

30:09.813 --> 30:12.202
- It's definitely possible.
- Yes.

30:12.373 --> 30:15.888
But what's impossible is thinking
that somehow, some way...

30:16.053 --> 30:18.487
...the Beast found where
we were hiding...

30:18.653 --> 30:20.883
...spiked the drinks
we made ourselves...

30:21.053 --> 30:23.931
...snuck through this
unreasonably large apartment...

30:24.093 --> 30:27.290
...on the tippy-toes of his cloven feet,
right up to the vault...

30:27.453 --> 30:30.365
...and killed poor Manny,
unseen and unheard.

30:31.813 --> 30:34.964
Maybe whoever did it
didn't have cloven feet.

30:36.093 --> 30:38.971
"The answer is among you."
I can't be the only one thinking it.

30:39.133 --> 30:41.931
Don't be ridiculous. Connor doesn't
even know where we are.

30:42.093 --> 30:44.687
- You didn't call him?
- He doesn't have a phone.

30:45.293 --> 30:46.612
I can't believe you'd...

30:46.773 --> 30:50.004
Even if she didn't call him,
that boy can track anybody, anywhere.

30:50.173 --> 30:52.607
I'd know if he'd been here.
I'd be able to smell him.

30:52.773 --> 30:56.322
Same way you smelled whatever
it was spiking your blood?

30:57.653 --> 30:59.609
This is impossible.

31:00.133 --> 31:03.011
I thought we were pretty clear
on the whole "impossible" issue.

31:03.173 --> 31:05.733
Unseen and unheard.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.851
The security cameras.

31:09.013 --> 31:11.732
Got them in every room.
We've just gotta rewind the tapes.

31:11.893 --> 31:14.726
In the meantime, call the hotel,
tell them about Manny.

31:14.893 --> 31:18.249
Tell them about the toy surprises too.
Let's find out what they're for...

31:18.413 --> 31:20.449
...and how we stop the Beast
from using them.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.285
Angel, about Connor...

31:22.453 --> 31:25.763
Check it out later,
like we do every other lead.

31:25.933 --> 31:27.685
Go.

31:30.773 --> 31:33.765
CORDELIA: What's that?
- That's nothing.

31:33.933 --> 31:36.322
The tapes go blank.
It's like the electrics got cut.

31:36.493 --> 31:38.563
Let me check the system log.

31:42.173 --> 31:45.051
- You have to talk to him, Angel.
- Who, Gunn? I just did.

31:45.213 --> 31:48.444
Connor, you dolt. And you know
who I meant, so why push my buttons?

31:48.613 --> 31:51.332
Maybe because it's nice
to make you crazy for a change.

31:51.493 --> 31:55.725
You can't seriously think he did it, when
there are other, more liar-like suspects.

31:55.893 --> 31:59.203
Well, so far, he's the only one
who's got a connection to the Beast.

31:59.373 --> 32:01.841
I've got the origin of the blackout.

32:02.573 --> 32:05.849
It kicked off in a small subset
of the municipal A-14 grid.

32:06.013 --> 32:07.571
That's the one under this block.

32:07.733 --> 32:10.805
- About 10 minutes before your watch.
- What does that mean?

32:10.973 --> 32:13.362
That somebody knew when you'd
take over that watch...

32:13.533 --> 32:15.569
...and somebody knew
whose drinks to spike.

32:15.733 --> 32:18.611
- This is an inside job.
- Funny how you were inside at the time.

32:18.773 --> 32:21.685
Enough. Let's just focus on the guy
trying to blot out the sun.

32:21.853 --> 32:23.172
We'll point fingers later.

32:24.973 --> 32:27.123
It never would have happened
on my watch.

32:27.293 --> 32:30.649
Gosh, no.
Because you're Super Tramp.

32:32.253 --> 32:35.768
- What's the latest?
- I checked out the ritual like you asked.

32:35.933 --> 32:37.844
Looks like there's
some assembly required.

32:38.013 --> 32:41.130
Turns out these three pieces
were inside the totems.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.443
Beast kills the totems,
yanks out the pieces...

32:43.613 --> 32:45.808
...and builds himself
a big, old light switch.

32:45.973 --> 32:48.931
Well, what about the other two?
What'd he take out of them?

32:49.093 --> 32:51.402
He sucked the energy
out of the little girl...

32:51.573 --> 32:53.962
...and he ripped the heart
out of the shaman...

32:54.133 --> 32:56.488
...but what's not clear
is how he's gonna use them.

32:56.653 --> 32:59.406
These wings.
They're metal, right?

32:59.573 --> 33:01.484
Get me close enough,
and I can melt them.

33:01.653 --> 33:03.928
- That'll slow him down.
- Lf we find him in time.

33:04.893 --> 33:09.045
He's already got all the pieces. Plus, we
don't know where he'll perform this ritual.

33:09.213 --> 33:12.569
I'm not worried about slowing him down.
I'm worried about taking him out.

33:12.733 --> 33:14.166

Firearms, the usual weaponry.

None of which seem to work.

33:30.213 --> 33:34.001
If we stand against it long enough and
corner it, maneuver it into position...

33:34.173 --> 33:37.051
We could send this thing
to the hell sweet hell it came from.

this is our only option.
