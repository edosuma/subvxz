00:50.334 --> 00:52.334
I have the best job in the world.

00:53.425 --> 00:57.105
We want to make a metal that's as hard
as steel but can bounce like rubber...

00:57.140 --> 00:58.359
and is edible.

00:58.394 --> 00:59.644
We can do that.

01:01.501 --> 01:03.536
I'm the head of a research and
development department

01:03.571 --> 01:05.720
for one the largest companies in America,

01:05.755 --> 01:07.305
Veridian Dynamics.

01:08.701 --> 01:09.979
Veronica's my boss.

01:10.014 --> 01:14.192
We need a mouse that can withstand
temperatures up to 195 degrees.

01:14.227 --> 01:15.477
We can do that.

01:16.528 --> 01:18.478
Uh, a computer mouse or a live mouse?

01:19.612 --> 01:21.112
I'll get back to you.

01:21.591 --> 01:24.789
Every day there's something new,
waiting to be discovered.

01:25.245 --> 01:26.539
Computer mouse.

01:26.574 --> 01:27.774
Easier.

01:28.281 --> 01:29.681
We do everything -

01:29.866 --> 01:31.885
industrial products, biomedical,

01:31.920 --> 01:34.070
cryogenics, defense technology.

01:34.925 --> 01:37.160
We want to weaponize a pumpkin.

01:37.387 --> 01:39.137
Then so do I.

01:39.577 --> 01:40.679
Because?

01:41.313 --> 01:44.210
There's a country with whom we do business
that grows a great deal of pumpkins

01:44.245 --> 01:46.595
and would welcome additional uses for them...

01:46.823 --> 01:48.902
As well as cheaper ways to kill their enemies.

01:48.937 --> 01:52.537
Well, finally the pumpkin gets to do
something besides Halloween.

01:53.453 --> 01:54.453
Pie.

01:55.072 --> 01:56.775
Halloween and pie.

02:01.135 --> 02:02.852
I've been at Veridian 3 years.

02:02.887 --> 02:05.272
Last year, I got a promotion,
and now I run a team

02:05.307 --> 02:08.907
of some of the smartest people in the world.

02:09.925 --> 02:11.097
There we go.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.168
Okay, people.

02:14.457 --> 02:17.321
We need to turn this simple,
festive gourd

02:17.356 --> 02:18.519
into a killer.

02:18.716 --> 02:22.048
I've asked Dr. Bhamba to take a look at
how nature does it because nature

02:22.083 --> 02:24.515
is a fantastic killer of things.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.545
Dr. Bhamba.

02:26.916 --> 02:27.916
Thank you.

02:28.121 --> 02:32.314
Nature attacks and annihilates the pumpkin
with powdery mildew disease,

02:32.349 --> 02:36.029
which can be mutated and designed to attack human cell structure,

02:36.064 --> 02:39.744
causing enemy soldiers to grow
a magnificent, soft downy coating

02:39.779 --> 02:41.079
and die...

02:41.702 --> 02:42.702
As mold.

02:42.737 --> 02:43.940
Oh, my god.

02:43.975 --> 02:45.833
Spores in uniforms.

02:45.969 --> 02:47.565
I think we get the picture.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.235
Uh, Cindy, Lester, Jerry, you're
with Dr. Bhamba on this.

02:51.270 --> 02:52.946
The rest of you, you're welcome.

02:54.699 --> 02:55.698
Ted,

02:55.733 --> 02:58.908
the drones working on the spy drone
came up with this cheap fabric.

02:58.943 --> 03:00.282
Find another use for it.

03:00.317 --> 03:02.017
Well, it's good texture,

03:02.205 --> 03:03.255
coloration.

03:03.292 --> 03:05.130
Maybe a breakfast meat.

03:05.165 --> 03:06.297
Are you serious?

03:06.332 --> 03:08.154
We want to be in that business.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.216
No.

03:09.367 --> 03:11.317
Y-you have to lighten up.

03:11.448 --> 03:12.825
Maybe I'm too funny.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.921
Maybe I was joking about
not getting your joke.

03:19.051 --> 03:20.456
<i>This is Lem.</i>

03:22.042 --> 03:23.521
<i>He's a genius.</i>

03:25.681 --> 03:26.965
<i>Seriously.</i>

03:30.045 --> 03:33.083
<i>For 10 years, Lem has been
research partners with...</i>

03:33.222 --> 03:34.222
<i>Phil,</i>

03:34.354 --> 03:35.954
<i>who's also a genius.</i>

03:38.477 --> 03:40.224
I'm so angry about the toilet paper.

03:40.259 --> 03:43.144
Why couldn't they leave it next to the toilet?
That proximity was so elegant.

03:43.179 --> 03:46.582
They think if it's harder to reach,
that we'll use less of it.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.589
They've destroyed going
to the bathroom for me.

03:48.624 --> 03:51.771
It used to be just a weird human function.
Now it's actively stressful.

03:51.806 --> 03:56.543
Okay, look, just take the roll off of the dispenser
and bring it with you before you sit.

03:56.841 --> 03:59.648
- That's what I do.
- What? That's not normal, Phil.

03:59.683 --> 04:01.268
It becomes normal...

04:01.303 --> 04:02.803
If you keep doing it.

04:03.407 --> 04:04.492
Everything does.

04:04.527 --> 04:07.789
Look, you can put up with their crap if
you want to. That's fine. That's who you are.

04:07.824 --> 04:10.379
But I'm not like that.
I'm a fighter.

04:10.414 --> 04:12.442
I fight stuff like this.

04:12.477 --> 04:14.927
- No, you don't.
- Shut up, Phil.

04:15.193 --> 04:17.642
I would if I thought I could win.

04:17.745 --> 04:19.199
No, because remember
there was that thing

04:19.233 --> 04:22.208
last week that you thought you could win
and you still didn't fight?

04:22.243 --> 04:23.273
Remember?

04:24.115 --> 04:25.552
With the sandwich?

04:25.672 --> 04:27.397
Yeah, I should've fought that.

04:27.432 --> 04:29.447
- I thought so.
- Hey, fellas.

04:29.482 --> 04:32.604
See if you can make this fabric
into a line of office chairs.

04:32.639 --> 04:34.273
It's very strong and,

04:34.449 --> 04:35.587
well, dark.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.266
Do you think I don't fight
injustice enough?

04:38.301 --> 04:39.751
Is this about the sandwich?

04:40.395 --> 04:43.157
Because I think, instinctively, you knew
you wouldn't have won that.

04:43.192 --> 04:44.507
Your mom's tough.

04:44.542 --> 04:47.739
She once killed a bat with
a "People" magazine.

04:47.774 --> 04:49.311
That is tough, but...

04:49.346 --> 04:50.787
one thing she's not?

04:50.822 --> 04:53.722
Someone who can create
something out of nothing,

04:54.094 --> 04:55.494
like you can.

04:55.664 --> 04:57.751
So make me an office chair.

05:00.874 --> 05:03.200
- He's a better man than you.
- Agreed.

05:03.235 --> 05:06.485
<i>The next step for any
product is testing.</i>

05:09.451 --> 05:12.342
<i>Testing is one of the things
Linda does for us.</i>

05:12.377 --> 05:15.199
People are squirming.
The fabric's not comfortable.

05:15.234 --> 05:17.006
Squirming? Or...

05:17.242 --> 05:20.893
are they just enjoying it so much, they want
their whole body to rub against it?

05:21.834 --> 05:25.933
Ted, I know you're an R&D legend
with magical R&D powers.

05:25.968 --> 05:28.055
But the chair? Just... no.

05:30.045 --> 05:33.048
Never give up. That's what I
always tell my daughter.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.335
She tells me to stop telling her,
but I tell her I can't,

05:35.370 --> 05:37.674
because that would be giving up.

05:40.663 --> 05:42.447
Look at these numbers.

05:43.017 --> 05:44.636
You scared me.

05:44.904 --> 05:47.219
- What's with the creamer?
- Nothing.

05:47.254 --> 05:49.014
They're mine. What's up?

05:50.187 --> 05:53.637
Productivity increase when
people use the chairs.

05:57.610 --> 05:58.827
I like creamer.

05:58.862 --> 06:02.712
I've only worked here 6 months. Is there
a rule about that I should know?

06:09.266 --> 06:10.776
When people can't get comfortable,

06:10.811 --> 06:14.354
they don't daydream or get distracted,
so they're more productive.

06:14.389 --> 06:16.303
And more filled with hate.

06:20.807 --> 06:22.707
<i>And the scratchier the fabric...</i>

06:23.676 --> 06:25.499
<i>The more uncomfortable people are</i>

06:25.534 --> 06:27.484
<i>and the harder they work.</i>

06:28.897 --> 06:30.211
Get it off me!

06:30.246 --> 06:33.193
<i>- Get it off me! Get it off!
- Up to a point,</i>

06:33.228 --> 06:34.736
<i>then they go mad.</i>

06:42.635 --> 06:46.204
<i>The Focus Master</i>

06:54.122 --> 06:55.764
<i>Over 1,000,000 pre-sold</i>

06:55.799 --> 06:58.349
Is it wrong to invent a deadly pumpkin

06:58.447 --> 07:01.037
or an irritating chair that makes
people work harder?

07:01.072 --> 07:03.465
The thing is, work's not about
right and wrong.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.808
It's about success...

07:04.843 --> 07:06.143
or failure.

07:06.879 --> 07:09.531
Your department's using too much creamer.

07:09.566 --> 07:10.578
Does it matter?

07:10.613 --> 07:13.288
It's not "Katrina", but it is a problem.

07:13.323 --> 07:15.338
Ted, there's been a spill... oh, hi,

07:15.373 --> 07:17.482
- Veronica. It's nothing.
- Hi, Phil.

07:17.517 --> 07:20.367
Actually, you're the reason I'm here.

07:21.082 --> 07:22.229
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

07:22.264 --> 07:23.399
- You can go now.
- But--

07:23.434 --> 07:25.816
I'm here to talk about you, not to you.

07:26.275 --> 07:27.292
I'm sorry.

07:29.453 --> 07:31.339
We want to freeze Phil.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.760
- Excuse me?
- Phil.

07:33.838 --> 07:35.949
The company wants to
cryonically freeze him,

07:35.984 --> 07:38.039
just for a year, to see if it's possible.

07:38.074 --> 07:39.237
We think it is.

07:39.272 --> 07:41.021
You think it's possible?

07:41.056 --> 07:42.956
Yes, Mr. Negative, we do.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.893
We have developed a chemical
which allows us to

07:45.928 --> 07:49.363
rapidly freeze live animal tissue
without it exploding.

07:49.398 --> 07:51.286
And, fingers crossed,

07:51.603 --> 07:54.203
we're ready for human testing.

07:54.352 --> 07:56.031
Your presentation sucks.

07:56.066 --> 07:57.056
And why Phil?

07:57.103 --> 07:59.712
Well, for PR reasons, they wanted an employee.

07:59.747 --> 08:03.971
And, in the unlikely event something goes wrong,
well, there are people here we would,

08:04.006 --> 08:05.006
you know,

08:05.108 --> 08:06.523
miss more.

08:06.558 --> 08:10.152
You be sure to tell him that when
you try to get him to do it.

08:11.484 --> 08:12.793
I see where this is going.

08:12.828 --> 08:15.259
Your guys will do anything for you, Ted.

08:15.335 --> 08:16.513
They've got...

08:17.026 --> 08:18.184
what's that thing again?

08:18.219 --> 08:19.483
Underlings have it.

08:19.518 --> 08:20.636
Loyalty.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.791
This is huge for us. You need
to make it happen.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.377
Well, I'll try.

08:27.824 --> 08:32.128
But Phil hates the cold and he freaks out in small spaces,
so this assignment is not ideal for him.

08:32.234 --> 08:34.721
Yeah, well, they originally suggested Lem, but...

08:34.756 --> 08:37.136
freeze the black guy? They're not stupid.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.092
If I'm gonna ask Phil to do something
potentially dangerous,

08:42.126 --> 08:44.284
I need to make sure that
it's potentially safe.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.366
So I've asked Linda to
check out the data.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.436
No, the zebra and the toaster are friends...

08:50.877 --> 08:52.227
I have to go.

08:52.493 --> 08:54.961
No, that makes the toaster too mean.
He's not a sociopath.

08:54.996 --> 08:57.215
He just doesn't want to
make toast anymore.

08:57.250 --> 08:58.458
Hi.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.330
Is that a new shirt?

09:00.617 --> 09:03.917
Oh, that's cool. Let's pretend that
that phone call wasn't odd.

09:04.188 --> 09:07.437
I'm trying to write a children's book,
and my illustrator doesn't get...

09:07.472 --> 09:08.948
most of it.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.835
Well, what's, uh, not to get?

09:10.870 --> 09:12.970
A toaster that doesn't want to make toast.

09:13.005 --> 09:15.005
And, of course, there's a zebra.

09:17.111 --> 09:19.794
You do the same thing every day.
You please everyone around you.

09:19.829 --> 09:21.154
At some point you say:

09:21.189 --> 09:24.582
"Making toast is fine, it's opened
some doors, but I need more."

09:24.617 --> 09:26.107
"So I'm -- I'm running away.

09:26.142 --> 09:27.495
"I don't know how.

09:27.530 --> 09:30.181
I'm, plugged into a wall,
I don't have legs, but I'm doing it."

09:30.216 --> 09:32.405
You totally get the toaster,

09:32.541 --> 09:35.240
and his complicated love/hate relationship
with the outlet.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.275
Who has all the power.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.497
- That's lame.
- You laughed.

09:42.448 --> 09:43.448
Yeah.

09:46.250 --> 09:49.091
- So, freezing Phil?
- You want to know about Phil?
It's probably okay...

09:49.126 --> 09:52.274
If he can get past minus -20 degrees
without his eyes bursting.

09:52.309 --> 09:54.274
That would be the first sign of trouble.

09:57.382 --> 09:59.309
This is a great company, isn't it?

09:59.344 --> 10:00.997
Freezing its employees.

10:01.032 --> 10:03.282
Employee. They're only freezing one.

10:04.022 --> 10:05.230
For now.

10:06.167 --> 10:09.288
Do you know that they send us the phone bills
for our non-work-related calls?

10:09.323 --> 10:10.404
They don't charge us for 'em.

10:10.439 --> 10:12.916
They just want us to know that
they know we're making 'em.

10:12.951 --> 10:15.101
Can a company be bitchy?

10:16.376 --> 10:19.376
- Is that why you steal creamer?
- Yes.

10:19.850 --> 10:21.600
It's an act of rebellion.

10:22.027 --> 10:26.453
I also scratched the words "place scrotum here"
On the lunch room table, but then,

10:26.488 --> 10:28.688
you know, that just
became the thing to do.

10:34.600 --> 10:37.666
- You have the best cubicle.
- Yeah, and we have been in all of them.

10:37.701 --> 10:38.867
Except Cindy's.

10:38.902 --> 10:41.124
Whoa. Cindy. No way. No.

10:41.394 --> 10:43.662
I've been in there, twice.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.437
She got so mad the first time,
I had to do it again.

10:45.472 --> 10:47.006
I'm definitely going in there sometime,

10:47.041 --> 10:49.891
twice also... as well.

10:50.281 --> 10:52.206
So we heard rumors something's
gonna be done to Phil?

10:52.241 --> 10:55.548
Yeah, and I just so want it
to be something good.

10:57.596 --> 10:59.836
Why do they want to freeze me?
I didn't do anything.

10:59.903 --> 11:02.113
No, Phil, it's not a punishment.

11:02.148 --> 11:03.311
It's-it's an honor.

11:03.492 --> 11:05.934
You've been chosen to be a pioneer,

11:05.969 --> 11:08.728
to go someplace no one's
ever gone before...

11:08.763 --> 11:10.455
And come back.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.777
I don't know.

11:15.091 --> 11:16.882
I can talk to my wife about it.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.900
Will I keep getting paid?
She's going to want to know that.

11:18.942 --> 11:20.125
Of course.

11:20.563 --> 11:21.563
I assume.

11:21.650 --> 11:23.744
I mean, technically, it is work.

11:23.779 --> 11:24.979
I'll check.

11:26.845 --> 11:28.321
You shouldn't freeze Phil.

11:28.356 --> 11:29.749
<i>This is my daughter Rose.</i>

11:29.784 --> 11:30.934
<i>She knows everything.</i>

11:31.158 --> 11:34.308
Honey, it's exciting. It's gonna be
a huge breakthrough in science.

11:34.343 --> 11:37.793
- I like Phil.
- Maybe you'll like him even
more when he's frozen.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.965
I like him the temperature he is.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.269
Phil came to my birthday.

11:42.304 --> 11:45.054
It's wrong to freeze someone
who comes to your daughter's birthday.

11:45.089 --> 11:46.089
Well...

11:47.276 --> 11:48.999
- Did you do your math homework?
- Yes.

11:49.034 --> 11:51.684
- 6 times 8?
- Yes, that was one of them.

11:53.130 --> 11:56.630
Would you do it? Would you do something
like this and leave me?

11:58.790 --> 12:01.889
When Rose was four, her mom left us
to go save the world.

12:01.924 --> 12:03.411
That's been hard for Rose.

12:03.446 --> 12:05.989
Frankly, not so great for the world, either.

12:06.024 --> 12:07.024
Hey.

12:08.826 --> 12:11.617
I would never leave you, ever.

12:12.125 --> 12:15.125
I know. We've discussed this.
You're a great dad.

12:15.337 --> 12:18.501
But it's wrong to ask Phil to
do something you wouldn't do.

12:19.776 --> 12:20.788
You're right.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.086
You're always right because stupidly,
I taught you right and wrong.

12:24.121 --> 12:25.439
Just tell 'em you don't want to do it.

12:25.474 --> 12:28.956
They can't force employees to participate
in human experiments.

12:28.991 --> 12:31.991
- They lost that court case.
- But I want to do it.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.386
What? Phil, that's crazy.

12:34.704 --> 12:37.200
Thank you. See? I'm not the only one.

12:37.906 --> 12:39.863
It is only for a year, Lem.

12:39.918 --> 12:41.447
I'll just stand perfectly still so

12:41.482 --> 12:44.502
I don't accidentally go on living
my life without you.

12:44.537 --> 12:45.859
- Moron.
- Look, Phil.

12:45.894 --> 12:49.944
I might've sold you a little too hard
yesterday, and-and that was...

12:51.133 --> 12:52.500
- Wrong.
- No.

12:52.535 --> 12:55.293
No, you were right.
This is my chance to be a pioneer.

12:55.328 --> 12:57.881
My wife thought it would be exciting,
too, which surprised me,

12:57.916 --> 13:01.711
because she's normally a deeply
and relentlessly negative person.

13:01.964 --> 13:03.364
Mrs. Moron.

13:04.048 --> 13:07.320
At least I have a Mrs. Moron.
Who's in your life, Lem?

13:07.355 --> 13:09.205
Why are you being so mean?

13:10.327 --> 13:11.377
<i>And so...</i>

13:11.427 --> 13:12.716
<i>They froze Phil.</i>

13:12.751 --> 13:14.451
What I do now...

13:14.609 --> 13:16.359
I do for science.

13:16.572 --> 13:19.022
And so I do not ask for your concern.

13:19.558 --> 13:22.487
All I ask is for your respect...

13:24.079 --> 13:25.979
Respect as a scientist,

13:26.713 --> 13:28.154
respect as a friend...

13:31.357 --> 13:34.507
Respect as a man.
Oh, god! I think this is it!

13:41.195 --> 13:43.612
I've never seen a man explode
from the inside.

13:43.647 --> 13:47.007
A rabbit, an eel, a goat, a monkey
and a reindeer,

13:47.042 --> 13:48.492
but that's all.

13:49.126 --> 13:50.202
I'm out.

13:55.815 --> 13:57.315
This is normal.

13:57.673 --> 13:59.873
Every company does stuff like this.

14:00.046 --> 14:01.061
Right?

14:03.377 --> 14:05.024
Does Phil look like he's in pain?

14:06.777 --> 14:09.677
Bummer to have to stay
like that for a year.

14:12.305 --> 14:16.355
I don't think you're crazy for stealing creamer.

14:20.861 --> 14:24.111
Watch closely. Minus -20
is when the eyes might burst.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.482
He's been like this for three days now.

14:59.517 --> 15:02.818
They promised him he could stay in the lab
with his friends, so that's good,

15:02.853 --> 15:04.053
right, buddy?

15:05.390 --> 15:06.490
Creepy.

15:07.185 --> 15:09.125
- They're moving him tomorrow.
- What?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.954
- Where?
- I think the basement.

15:10.989 --> 15:13.539
Although, there's been talk of India.

15:32.281 --> 15:34.081
Hello. No, I can talk.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.500
Phil thawed out? How?

15:38.741 --> 15:40.039
It's very technical.

15:55.599 --> 15:57.440
- Is he okay?
- He's fine.

15:57.910 --> 15:58.960
It's just...

15:59.722 --> 16:01.061
something's not quite right.

16:01.096 --> 16:04.996
Next we looked at Methyl Thiazole-4,
which we assumed would...

16:09.798 --> 16:13.253
So this thing with Phil, making
that stupid face and yelling-

16:13.288 --> 16:14.599
they think it's distracting.

16:14.634 --> 16:17.073
I guess in hindsight they shouldn't
have vitrified his brains.

16:17.136 --> 16:19.964
Look, i'm not gonna play the blame
game with you. The point is,

16:19.999 --> 16:21.699
they need you to let him go.

16:21.758 --> 16:22.803
What?

16:37.401 --> 16:38.401
Have you...

16:38.436 --> 16:39.678
been avoiding me...

16:39.839 --> 16:40.939
since...

16:41.411 --> 16:43.261
you know, you held my hand?

16:44.041 --> 16:45.041
No.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.315
And-and I didn't hold your hand. I...

16:49.482 --> 16:52.582
held on to your hand after
you held my hand.

16:53.518 --> 16:54.518
Okay.

16:54.911 --> 16:56.511
That's how we're playing it?

16:56.588 --> 16:58.188
We're gonna play it stupid?

16:58.660 --> 17:01.738
Okay, I... I don't know how it happened.

17:01.944 --> 17:02.959
I do.

17:03.120 --> 17:07.358
I was standing there like this, and you
took my hand like this, and that's...

17:08.828 --> 17:10.578
how it happened.

17:12.878 --> 17:14.378
- Linda.
- Ted...

17:15.973 --> 17:18.123
I used up my office affair.

17:18.642 --> 17:20.742
- What now?
- You only get one,

17:21.134 --> 17:24.020
otherwise you're that guy that sleeps around.
And about a year ago, I used mine.

17:24.097 --> 17:26.614
Ted, that was an excellent presentation.

17:26.648 --> 17:30.599
Everything you said was just so
concise and exactly...

17:31.890 --> 17:34.340
I think you and I should have sex.

17:34.735 --> 17:35.766
If you want.

17:37.972 --> 17:38.972
Look at me.

17:39.074 --> 17:41.940
I'm so nervous, I'm shaking like a leaf.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.632
- No, no, you're not.
- No.

17:44.667 --> 17:48.867
Is that a problem? I don't get nervous.
I try. It just doesn't come out.

17:49.062 --> 17:50.862
I guess that makes me...

17:51.348 --> 17:52.409
vulnerable.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.590
No, you're not vulnerable.

17:55.882 --> 17:56.882
No.

17:57.305 --> 17:58.305
So...

17:58.486 --> 18:00.486
where does that put us?

18:11.572 --> 18:12.608
Ted, it's okay.

18:12.643 --> 18:16.093
Really. I don't care.
I work for you. It would be...

18:19.565 --> 18:23.215
Besides, only an idiot would have
an affair with their boss.

18:31.352 --> 18:32.552
Pretty girl.

18:34.162 --> 18:37.942
Although, she makes a lot of
non-work-related calls,

18:37.977 --> 18:40.477
which I think makes her less attractive.

18:41.437 --> 18:45.517
Listen, Veronica, about firing Phil, I don't think
we should rush into anything.

18:45.552 --> 18:46.529
You're right.

18:46.564 --> 18:50.514
Wait until the end of business Friday.
It'll be easier for payroll.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.441
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

18:57.908 --> 18:59.889
Now they want you to fire Phil.

18:59.924 --> 19:01.924
That's what I'm supposed to do, yep.

19:03.493 --> 19:07.143
Do grown-ups even care
about right and wrong?

19:08.636 --> 19:10.236
Did you brush your teeth?

19:11.276 --> 19:12.926
Don't change the subject.

19:22.222 --> 19:24.022
- Hello, Linda.
- Hi.

19:24.422 --> 19:28.872
Did I surprise you? I didn't mean to surprise you.
I'm just a friendly person.

19:29.783 --> 19:31.792
I didn't think you knew my name.

19:31.827 --> 19:33.577
Well, of course I know your name.

19:33.774 --> 19:35.724
I know a lot about you.

19:36.323 --> 19:37.323
Linda...

19:37.565 --> 19:38.665
Katherine...

19:38.748 --> 19:39.748
Zword...

19:39.783 --> 19:40.660
ning...

19:40.695 --> 19:41.695
ling.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.166
Zwordling.

19:44.391 --> 19:47.291
Fine. You know your name
better than I do. Yay.

19:48.362 --> 19:51.158
Ted, I can't have you sleeping with Linda.

19:51.193 --> 19:53.039
- What?
- It could embarrass me,

19:53.074 --> 19:54.527
plus I may not be done with you yet.

19:54.562 --> 19:55.812
Hey, guys.

19:56.973 --> 19:59.929
Hi, Phil. I hear you're blinking again.

19:59.964 --> 20:01.064
Good for you.

20:01.544 --> 20:04.639
- Why is he still here?
- Because, Veronica, I'm not firing him.

20:04.674 --> 20:07.962
- But they want you to fire him.
- I don't care. It's just wrong.

20:07.997 --> 20:09.947
So then you're saying no to them?

20:10.169 --> 20:12.460
That's an interesting career choice.

20:12.495 --> 20:14.271
Phil doesn't deserve to be fired.

20:14.306 --> 20:16.359
He's incredibly smart.
He's hardworking.

20:16.394 --> 20:17.657
He let us freeze him!

20:17.692 --> 20:20.843
He's the last guy that deserves
to be fired, and i'm standing by him.

20:23.573 --> 20:25.523
Dude. You're not helping me.

20:26.453 --> 20:27.803
Okay, I'll talk to them.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.250
But what you're doing is gonna
hurt their feelings,

20:30.285 --> 20:34.455
and when their feelings get hurt,
they hurt the ones they love.

20:34.871 --> 20:36.818
And they love you, Ted.

20:37.184 --> 20:38.950
Well, then maybe I should talk to them.

20:38.985 --> 20:41.785
No. They don't want to talk
to you when you're like this.
