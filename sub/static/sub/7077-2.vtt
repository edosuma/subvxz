WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:03.650
- And Andre's going as Han Solo.

00:03.651 --> 00:04.784
- Oh!

00:04.785 --> 00:05.885
- The boys are stormtroopers

00:05.886 --> 00:07.121
and little baby Ben is an ewok.

00:07.122 --> 00:08.688
- Oh!
- Oh!

00:08.689 --> 00:10.191
- Aw, you don't have enough children.

00:10.192 --> 00:12.259
- Happy Halloween parties, everyone.

00:12.260 --> 00:13.894
You all look great...
ham.

00:13.895 --> 00:15.795
- Pig.
Let me guess.

00:15.796 --> 00:17.931
You're a flimsy excuse to be shirtless,

00:17.932 --> 00:19.100
wearing silk underwear.

00:19.101 --> 00:21.268
- And you are as wrong
as you are welcome.

00:21.269 --> 00:23.937
Now, this year, I planned
a two-person costume with Annie.

00:23.938 --> 00:25.239
She's going as my ring girl.

00:29.343 --> 00:31.011
- Pretty freaky-deaky, huh?

00:31.012 --> 00:33.914
- Annie, no. I meant
the boxing match ring girl.

00:33.915 --> 00:35.917
They're the sexy ones
that hold the round numbers.

00:35.918 --> 00:37.150
- Yeah, see?

00:37.151 --> 00:39.386
This is why we can't
just text about it, Jeff.

00:39.387 --> 00:41.154
I don't watch sports.

00:41.155 --> 00:42.721
- But there's no boxer in the ring.

00:42.722 --> 00:44.025
- Yeah, well, I don't watch
scary movies.

00:44.026 --> 00:46.993
- And that's why we leave
the couples' costumes

00:46.994 --> 00:50.163
to the couples, she said wisely.

00:50.164 --> 00:52.031
- You should probably warn
your boyfriend's boyfriend.

00:52.032 --> 00:53.265
- Just because we're dating doesn't mean

00:53.266 --> 00:54.767
that we have to do everything together.

00:54.768 --> 00:56.404
- Well, you need to do
some things together.

00:56.405 --> 00:58.171
- We do some things.

00:58.172 --> 00:59.373
We do a lot of things.

00:59.374 --> 01:02.175
Not all the things.

01:02.176 --> 01:03.677
Things.

01:03.678 --> 01:06.413
- Okay, so, we're all here,
minus Pierce,

01:06.414 --> 01:07.980
who wasn't invited to Vicki's party

01:07.981 --> 01:09.882
for reasons beyond
ourcontrol or concern.

01:09.883 --> 01:12.353
- No mystery there. She put
a pencil through his face.

01:13.788 --> 01:15.120
- Does Vicki have a TV?
- Abed, it's a party.

01:15.121 --> 01:16.822
You're not watching TV.
- No, I'll be watching Annie.

01:16.823 --> 01:18.057
She started watching
Cougar town re-runs,

01:18.058 --> 01:19.860
which makes Annie
my third favorite show,

01:19.861 --> 01:21.895
and tonight is
their hallo-wine special.

01:21.896 --> 01:24.864
- Ooh, that's right.
Better not miss the Merlot.

01:24.865 --> 01:27.367
Clink! What?
You fall into it.

01:27.368 --> 01:28.367
- That was Pierce.

01:28.368 --> 01:29.702
He accidentally locked himself

01:29.703 --> 01:30.838
in his panic room and he needs our help.

01:30.839 --> 01:31.838
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:31.839 --> 01:32.973
- No, "Oh!"

01:32.974 --> 01:34.873
"Oh" means we are going
against our will,

01:34.874 --> 01:35.910
and we are not going.

01:35.911 --> 01:36.910
He's lying.

01:36.911 --> 01:38.110
- He seemed pretty upset,

01:38.111 --> 01:39.313
and he's been all alone
up there in that mansion

01:39.314 --> 01:42.382
ever since I moved out,
and his dad, you know,

01:42.383 --> 01:44.084
got killed by Jeff.

01:44.085 --> 01:47.954
- Hmm, calling for help.
A classic call for help.

01:47.955 --> 01:50.857
Hello, Dr. Perry's Office.
Damaged psyche?

01:50.858 --> 01:52.626
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

01:52.627 --> 01:53.892
- Heads, lock up your brains.

01:53.893 --> 01:55.830
Britta's on the prowl
for fresh therapy meat.

01:55.831 --> 01:58.765
- Maybe we should just stop by
on our way to the party.

01:58.766 --> 02:00.032
- I assure you,

02:00.033 --> 02:02.034
the only thing Pierce is
trapped in is adolescence.

02:02.035 --> 02:03.337
He is a geriatric toddler,

02:03.338 --> 02:05.905
throwing the most elaborate
tantrums money can buy,

02:05.906 --> 02:08.074
and I, for one, am not gonna stand by

02:08.074 --> 02:10.810
and allow some lonely, ridiculous person

02:10.811 --> 02:12.712
to derail our group's plans.

02:12.713 --> 02:15.215
- Ding, ding, ding!
To your corners, fighters.

02:15.216 --> 02:19.019
Someone save me a towel.

02:19.020 --> 02:21.054
you guys going to Vicki's party?

02:21.055 --> 02:23.890
- We just gotta do this thing first.

02:24.891 --> 02:25.993
♪ give me some rope ♪

02:25.994 --> 02:27.861
♪ time in a dream ♪

02:27.862 --> 02:30.797
♪ give me the hope to run out of steam ♪

02:30.798 --> 02:34.134
♪ somebody said it could be here ♪

02:34.135 --> 02:38.138
♪ we could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year ♪

02:38.139 --> 02:43.310
♪ I can't count the reasons

02:43.311 --> 02:47.814
♪ one by one, they all just fade away ♪

02:54.955 --> 02:56.956
- Oh.

02:56.957 --> 02:59.359
Holy Helen, this place is huge.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.728
- It seems spookier than I remember.

03:01.729 --> 03:03.930
- Ah, the only thing spooky
about this place

03:03.931 --> 03:05.632
is the tacky decor.

03:05.633 --> 03:08.368
It's like David Lee Roth
threw up Miami Vice.

03:08.369 --> 03:10.870
so tacky.

03:10.871 --> 03:12.272
- I don't know.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.672
Maybe Pierce isn't doing so well

03:13.673 --> 03:15.374
since he lost his father
and then his inheritance

03:15.375 --> 03:16.977
in a video game battle with Gilbert,

03:16.978 --> 03:20.013
an illegitimate half-Brother
he never knew he had.

03:20.014 --> 03:21.349
I guess I've never said it out loud.

03:21.350 --> 03:22.849
- Guys, over here.

03:22.850 --> 03:24.151
Mr. Hawthorne's panic room,

03:24.152 --> 03:26.252
one of the 27 stops on the guided tour

03:26.253 --> 03:28.354
I had to memorize before
moving into Hawthorne Manor.

03:28.355 --> 03:30.022
- Does the house get many visitors?

03:30.023 --> 03:31.056
- You're the first.

03:31.057 --> 03:32.991
Impenetrable titanium carbonite door,

03:32.992 --> 03:34.762
Hacker-Proof key-Code
access panel,

03:34.763 --> 03:36.863
and impressive video telecom
screen with remote.

03:36.864 --> 03:38.932
Maximum occupancy one,
with female companion.

03:38.933 --> 03:40.834
Purchased June 30, 1989.

03:40.835 --> 03:42.668
It took me forever
to remember that date.

03:42.669 --> 03:43.902
- June 30, 1989.

03:43.903 --> 03:45.139
Theatrical release
of do the right thing.

03:45.140 --> 03:46.139
- oh!

03:46.140 --> 03:47.140
Oh.

03:47.141 --> 03:48.308
- Wait!

03:48.309 --> 03:50.410
It might be a trap.
Or it might let him out.

03:50.411 --> 03:52.779
Either way, we--
- Oh, put a sock in it, shorts.

03:54.715 --> 03:55.850
- Oh, hey, guys.

03:55.851 --> 03:57.917
- Pierce, are you okay?

03:57.918 --> 03:59.753
- Oh, sure.
Fine, fine.

03:59.754 --> 04:01.721
I was dusting in here,

04:01.722 --> 04:04.157
and I must have bumped
a switch or something.

04:04.158 --> 04:05.725
As the graceful one in the group,

04:05.726 --> 04:07.160
I'm kind of embarrassed.

04:07.161 --> 04:08.695
- don't be.

04:08.696 --> 04:10.064
I've been locked in
way worse places than this.

04:10.065 --> 04:12.098
Oh, not against my will.

04:12.099 --> 04:13.700
Been in there long?

04:13.701 --> 04:16.403
- No, not long, but I couldn't
remember the damn code.

04:16.404 --> 04:17.838
Sorry to be a burden on you guys,

04:17.839 --> 04:20.005
but I guess that's all I am now.

04:20.007 --> 04:21.207
- oh!
- Oh!

04:21.208 --> 04:22.307
- It's okay.
We're happy to help.

04:22.308 --> 04:23.310
- Yeah, no sweat, boba fett.

04:23.311 --> 04:24.978
- Yeah.
Do you have a TV?

04:24.979 --> 04:27.981
- What Abed means is, did you
write the code down anywhere?

04:27.982 --> 04:32.085
- Yes. It's in a red notebook
in my study

04:32.086 --> 04:33.653
or my bedroom, maybe.

04:33.654 --> 04:34.889
I used to know where everything was

04:34.890 --> 04:36.990
before I fired my maid.

04:36.991 --> 04:38.957
Now there's no reason to use my safe.

04:38.958 --> 04:41.162
- that's okay. We'll find it.
It'll take two secs.

04:41.163 --> 04:44.097
- Or we take one sec
and just skip to the catch.

04:44.098 --> 04:45.998
This place has not been
dusted in months,

04:45.999 --> 04:47.201
and he starts with the panic room?

04:47.202 --> 04:49.269
No sale.
He's not a sad old man.

04:49.270 --> 04:51.671
He's a sad old liar.
- Jeffrey!

04:51.672 --> 04:54.908
- No, no, he's right.
I've been lying to you.

04:54.909 --> 04:56.243
The truth is, last night, I got up

04:56.244 --> 04:58.278
to get a glass
of red W--Uh, water,

04:58.279 --> 05:00.247
and on my way back from the cellar,

05:00.248 --> 05:02.248
I saw something that scared me so badly,

05:02.249 --> 05:04.751
I locked myself in here, on purpose.

05:04.752 --> 05:07.687
The part about not remembering
the code is True.

05:07.688 --> 05:09.088
I'm very thirsty.

05:09.089 --> 05:10.790
- Why didn't you call me sooner?

05:10.791 --> 05:13.060
- I had to come up with
that awesome dusting story

05:13.061 --> 05:15.795
because if you knew what spooked me,

05:15.796 --> 05:18.631
you'd probably call me crazy and old.

05:18.632 --> 05:19.867
- No one's gonna call you, Pierce.

05:19.868 --> 05:23.102
- You can tell us.
We're here to help you.

05:23.103 --> 05:26.139
- I thought I saw my dad.
- Oh!

05:26.140 --> 05:28.242
- It looked like his face was
coming right through the wall,

05:28.243 --> 05:32.979
but that's impossible,
because my dad is dead.

05:32.980 --> 05:35.081
- aha!

05:35.082 --> 05:37.083
I mean, not, aha, your dad is dead,

05:37.084 --> 05:38.952
But, aha, I knew it.

05:38.953 --> 05:42.021
Ghost dad, exploring
your haunted mansion

05:42.022 --> 05:43.323
for secret codes?

05:43.324 --> 05:46.826
Nice try, Pierce.
You gotta be kidding me!

05:46.827 --> 05:49.061
What in the Scooby-Doo
is happening to you people?

05:49.062 --> 05:50.929
- Jeff, just go to the party,
and we'll meet you there.

05:50.930 --> 05:52.698
We're gonna stay here and help Pierce.

05:52.699 --> 05:54.401
- He doesn't need help.
He needs attention.

05:54.402 --> 05:57.804
Are you really this naive?
- Am I naive?

05:57.805 --> 06:00.940
I'm sure as stuff not
your sexy little ring girl.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.942
- I--
- Can it, ham.

06:02.943 --> 06:04.944
She's also my ride.

06:10.028 --> 06:10.901
- Troy said--

06:10.902 --> 06:12.369
- Pierce's bedroom
is the third door on the left.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.611
I didn't leave my short-term
memory at Coachella.

06:14.612 --> 06:16.678
- Jeez, Winger, keep it above the belt.

06:16.679 --> 06:18.747
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, already forgotten.

06:18.748 --> 06:20.382
- This house is getting to me.

06:20.383 --> 06:22.619
- I know. Kind of weird that
a dead person used to live here.

06:22.620 --> 06:25.220
- No, what's weird is that
a living person lived here

06:25.221 --> 06:27.222
with his parents, well into his 60s.

06:27.223 --> 06:29.190
Then they died, and he's still here,

06:29.191 --> 06:30.660
like a paralyzed Peter Pan.

06:30.661 --> 06:32.027
- Not for long.

06:32.028 --> 06:33.563
I'm gonna set my shrink-ray
to daddy issues

06:33.564 --> 06:35.998
and blast that sucker full of closure.

06:35.999 --> 06:37.166
- Well, I guess it can't hurt.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.201
- Exactly, because,
in one way or another,

06:39.202 --> 06:40.702
therapy is always helpful.

06:40.703 --> 06:42.472
- No, because there's no possible way

06:42.473 --> 06:43.972
you could mess him up worse.

06:43.973 --> 06:45.408
It's like practicing on a cadaver.

06:45.409 --> 06:46.975
Knock yourself out.

06:46.976 --> 06:47.977
- This has got to be it.

06:47.978 --> 06:49.144
- ugh.

06:49.145 --> 06:51.413
I wish I didn't have
so much exposed skin.

06:52.749 --> 06:54.616
agh.

06:57.220 --> 06:59.121
- Tubular.

06:59.122 --> 07:01.456
- I, too, lack the adjectives.

07:01.457 --> 07:02.658
- ♪ Heaven-- ♪

07:02.659 --> 07:06.695
- Now, how does one search
for a red notebook

07:06.696 --> 07:08.431
that doesn't exist
without looking, touching,

07:08.432 --> 07:09.965
or creating future nightmares?

07:09.966 --> 07:11.267
- I'll check the nightstand.

07:11.268 --> 07:14.036
- I'll check my messages.

07:14.037 --> 07:15.437
- Oh, my God.

07:15.438 --> 07:18.440
Pierce keeps
his dad's bowtie by his bed.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.474
Yeesh.

07:19.475 --> 07:21.576
Table for siggy Freud,
party of--

07:21.577 --> 07:23.645
- Britta, stop answering phones.

07:23.646 --> 07:25.415
How about we ask rip Van racism
where the codes are?

07:25.416 --> 07:27.249
- Don't. That's not nice.
- What?

07:27.250 --> 07:29.085
He was a tight-Fisted,
philandering bigot

07:29.086 --> 07:30.652
who got to outlive most Bridges.

07:30.653 --> 07:32.119
We don't owe him our reverence.

07:32.120 --> 07:33.688
So, how about it, you old bag of dust?

07:33.689 --> 07:35.256
You got our numbers?

07:35.257 --> 07:36.624
- I'm serious. Stop it.
- Come on.

07:36.625 --> 07:38.459
You don't really believe in ghosts?

07:38.460 --> 07:40.728
- I don't know. I'm just
not so quick to rule it out.

07:40.729 --> 07:41.998
I believe people can be haunted

07:41.999 --> 07:44.199
by unresolved issues in their past.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.599
- Yeah, but issues
don't turn into ghosts.

07:45.600 --> 07:46.968
- Maybe for Pierce, they have.

07:46.969 --> 07:48.235
Maybe Pierce and his dad

07:48.236 --> 07:50.106
have some seriously unfinished business.

07:50.107 --> 07:52.674
- No, the dead can't have business.

07:52.675 --> 07:54.676
They can't want or think or do.

07:54.677 --> 07:56.145
It's what makes them dead.

07:56.146 --> 07:58.347
It's the living
who choose to be haunted.

07:58.348 --> 08:00.649
Cornelius was barely a dad.

08:00.650 --> 08:01.984
Now, he's nothing.

08:01.985 --> 08:04.052
And Pierce keeps staring into that void

08:04.053 --> 08:06.655
or he can turn around,
face his future like I did,

08:06.656 --> 08:09.358
and say, "who gives a crap
who my dad was?

08:09.359 --> 08:12.527
I'm my own man now.
I--"

08:12.528 --> 08:14.429
wow.
Pretty slick, Britta,

08:14.430 --> 08:16.465
using ghosts to trick me
into opening up.

08:16.466 --> 08:17.734
Too bad it didn't work.

08:17.735 --> 08:21.603
- Aw, man, so this is
what the zone feels like.

08:21.604 --> 08:24.139
Oh!
Analyze this!

08:26.976 --> 08:29.111
- We don't want to go over
the same area twice,

08:29.112 --> 08:30.380
so be thorough.

08:30.381 --> 08:32.748
- Thorough. Got it.

08:35.518 --> 08:38.687
More of a burnt umber, but I
won't hold that against him.

08:38.688 --> 08:41.756
"Pierce Hawthorne's ideas for ladies"?

08:41.758 --> 08:43.592
Oh, please.

08:48.464 --> 08:52.601
"Blonde, long legs, with tennis racquet.

08:52.602 --> 08:54.002
"Asian rockette.

08:54.003 --> 08:56.638
Big boobs, redhead, but doctor,"
question mark.

08:56.639 --> 08:59.741
Oh, he's not 100% on that one?

08:59.742 --> 09:01.544
- This is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

09:01.545 --> 09:03.246
- How long is this?

09:04.547 --> 09:07.449
Okay, I don't have the codes.

09:07.450 --> 09:08.551
Maybe Shirley and Troy

09:08.552 --> 09:10.686
are having better luck in the library.

09:14.624 --> 09:16.692
Abed?

09:18.761 --> 09:20.696
Abed?

09:23.399 --> 09:25.200
If this is supposed to be, like,

09:25.201 --> 09:27.969
that part in that movie
that's like this,

09:27.970 --> 09:30.672
I would like to remind you
that I don't watch scary movies

09:30.673 --> 09:33.675
and therefore cannot
appreciate the homage.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:45.254 --> 09:46.722
Abed?

09:47.757 --> 09:48.758
Aah!

09:55.398 --> 09:59.001
I hate reference humor.

10:01.671 --> 10:03.472
- Hold on.

10:03.473 --> 10:05.408
I've been offended
by this coat rack before.

10:05.409 --> 10:06.975
Are we going in circles?

10:06.976 --> 10:08.144
- Okay, so maybe I spent

10:08.145 --> 10:10.011
a little less time in the library

10:10.012 --> 10:12.714
than, say,
the walk-In cereal closet,

10:12.715 --> 10:15.517
but it's definitely near here.

10:15.518 --> 10:17.119
- You skipped this door.

10:17.120 --> 10:18.586
- Pierce told me
I don't need to go in there.

10:18.587 --> 10:19.722
- then it's probably the library.

10:19.723 --> 10:21.624
Racist son of a--

10:23.292 --> 10:25.494
sodom and gomorrah.

10:25.495 --> 10:27.129
- It's Pierce's special gym.

10:27.130 --> 10:29.265
He never let me use it,
'cause he thinks I'm a child.

10:29.266 --> 10:30.332
- Hold--

10:30.333 --> 10:31.499
- He's hiding the indoor swing,

10:31.500 --> 10:32.535
and I'm the child.

10:32.536 --> 10:33.535
- No.

10:33.536 --> 10:36.471
Troy, get out of there.

10:36.472 --> 10:38.673
- Why does he have so many collars?

10:38.674 --> 10:40.175
Secret dogs!

10:40.176 --> 10:43.612
- Oh, it's okay.
Come on. Oh, no.

10:43.613 --> 10:44.980
Forget you saw that,

10:44.981 --> 10:46.514
and then forget I knew what it was.

10:46.515 --> 10:48.384
- Great, you won't tell me,
Pierce won't tell me.

10:48.385 --> 10:50.719
I have no idea what to Google.
I'll never know.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.086
- believe me, dating Britta,

10:52.087 --> 10:53.687
you'll know too much too soon
soon enough.

10:53.688 --> 10:55.191
- What does Britta have to do with this?

10:55.192 --> 10:59.761
- Well, she's a modern woman
with experienced tastes.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.162
I think it's nice you two are dating.

11:01.163 --> 11:02.698
I only hope she doesn't
make you feel pressured.

11:02.699 --> 11:05.667
- pressured to what?
- To fulfill her expectations.

11:05.668 --> 11:08.236
Expectations of what?

11:08.237 --> 11:10.672
Never mind.
- Unsatisfied with what?

11:23.753 --> 11:26.688
- Whaaaa--Oh.
- Whaaaa--Oh.

11:26.689 --> 11:28.423
- I lost Abed.

11:28.424 --> 11:30.257
I turned around and he disappeared.

11:30.258 --> 11:31.561
- I told you to never
let him out of your sight.

11:31.562 --> 11:34.229
That goes double for holidays
and wax museums.

11:34.230 --> 11:35.464
- How are we gonna find him?

11:35.465 --> 11:37.199
- I don't know, but we have to.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.402
He's probably already looking for us.

11:40.703 --> 11:42.437
- aah!

11:42.438 --> 11:45.040
- Oh, well, that's hallo-Wine
in cougar town for ya.

11:46.742 --> 11:51.279
Oh, ladies, I'll follow you anywhere.

11:51.280 --> 11:54.182
- I do not have daddy issues.
- You get two minutes.

11:54.183 --> 11:56.351
- Denial is the first step
to acceptance.

11:56.352 --> 11:57.653
- that can't be right.
- Says the deny-ist.

11:57.654 --> 11:58.720
- Not a word.

11:58.721 --> 11:59.755
- You want to keep digging this hole?

11:59.756 --> 12:01.623
Confronting your daddy issues now

12:01.624 --> 12:03.624
could prevent you from
ending up haunted, like Pierce.

12:03.625 --> 12:05.426
- I'll never end up like Pierce.
- Won't you?

12:05.427 --> 12:06.727
- No, because I'm nothing like him.

12:06.728 --> 12:08.331
- aren't you?
- Are you gonna keep doing that?

12:08.332 --> 12:10.565
- Am I?
- The worst therapist? No.

12:10.566 --> 12:11.667
Because you're not a therapist.

12:11.668 --> 12:13.735
But since your misdiagnosing by a mile,

12:13.736 --> 12:15.338
let me point out some differences.

12:15.339 --> 12:17.472
Pierce was raised by his dad.

12:17.473 --> 12:19.207
Mine took off when I was eight.

12:19.208 --> 12:20.474
Pierce spent his whole, pathetic life

12:20.475 --> 12:22.245
begging for scraps
of his father's approval.

12:22.246 --> 12:23.411
I moved on.

12:23.412 --> 12:25.346
Maybe Pierce needs a dad.
I don't.

12:25.347 --> 12:26.649
- don't you?
- Stop that!

12:26.650 --> 12:29.117
Okay, if I need a dad so bad,

12:29.118 --> 12:31.653
how come I've had his
phone number for three weeks

12:31.654 --> 12:34.489
without the slightest urge to call him?

12:34.490 --> 12:36.091
- You found your dad?

12:36.092 --> 12:38.059
- Did I?

12:38.060 --> 12:39.694
- Give it here!

12:39.695 --> 12:42.297
- I remember when this show was
about a community college.

12:47.303 --> 12:50.705
- No, you take the fish sticks, senator.

12:50.706 --> 12:52.707
Enjoy the boat show.

12:56.212 --> 12:58.313
cool.

12:59.549 --> 13:01.549
cool, cool, cool.

13:04.987 --> 13:07.689
- Just let me see the number,
for medical purposes!

13:07.690 --> 13:09.157
- No!

13:09.158 --> 13:11.126
- Help me heal your heart hole!

13:11.127 --> 13:12.360
- Never!

13:13.663 --> 13:16.531
So, this is where Pierce
has been hiding the taste.

13:23.539 --> 13:25.573
- Here's to you, Cornelius.

13:25.574 --> 13:27.510
Gone, But not forgiven.

13:36.619 --> 13:37.752
Of course.

13:37.753 --> 13:39.722
Otherwise, it wouldn't be pointless.

13:43.759 --> 13:45.560
- This is pointless.

13:45.561 --> 13:48.063
We have no Abed, no codes.

13:48.064 --> 13:50.198
Pierce sent us on a wild goose Chase.

13:50.199 --> 13:52.467
Jeff was right.
I am naive.

13:52.468 --> 13:54.102
- Oh, don't listen to him.

13:54.103 --> 13:56.103
- there's nothing naive about
helping a friend in need.

13:56.104 --> 13:57.638
Jeff would know that
if he wasn't too cool

13:57.639 --> 13:59.039
for after-School specials.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.142
- Thanks, Troy.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.010
- don't worry.
Abed's here.

14:02.011 --> 14:03.712
I can feel him.

14:03.713 --> 14:05.981
Maybe we should loop back
to the indoor swing room.

14:05.982 --> 14:08.049
- Indoor swing?
That's ridiculous.

14:08.050 --> 14:09.518
Someone's gonna break a lamp.

14:09.519 --> 14:11.587
- Break something on it.

14:18.294 --> 14:20.562
- Britta, while I applaud
your gentle approach

14:20.563 --> 14:21.996
to psychoanalysis,

14:21.997 --> 14:23.598
I'm not gonna talk about it.

14:24.735 --> 14:26.634
Hey, cut it out!

14:28.104 --> 14:31.374
you're gonna break
the... door.

14:46.655 --> 14:48.355
- Well, look who came crawling back.

14:48.356 --> 14:49.759
- I'm not crawling.
Walking. Quite briskly.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.127
Follow!

14:52.128 --> 14:54.696
- I like talking to you,
Annie. It's easy.

14:54.697 --> 14:56.499
I hope you feel like
you can talk to me too.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.733
- Ohh!

14:58.734 --> 15:00.101
Uh, I--

15:00.102 --> 15:02.170
- Spit it out.
No secrets between roomies.

15:02.171 --> 15:03.171
- Behind you!

15:03.172 --> 15:04.340
- I'm behind you too.

15:04.341 --> 15:05.707
- Hands! Wall!

15:05.708 --> 15:07.676
- Not sure where you're going here,

15:07.677 --> 15:09.210
But just let it out.

15:09.211 --> 15:10.979
- aah!
- Aah!

15:10.980 --> 15:14.249
- Waah! Aah! Don't let it out!
Don't let it out!

15:26.762 --> 15:29.198
- All right, Pierce,
turn off your haunted house!

15:30.533 --> 15:31.633
- Aah!
- Aah!

15:31.634 --> 15:33.134
- Oh, my God, Pierce is dead.

15:33.135 --> 15:34.502
- Cornelius killed him.

15:34.503 --> 15:38.641
- I broke the remote!
Do you think it's expensive?

15:41.719 --> 15:42.920
- Please, Pierce.

15:42.921 --> 15:45.021
Please don't die
slightly before your time.

15:45.022 --> 15:47.990
- This means we're next,
and I care about us.

15:47.991 --> 15:49.359
- It's okay.
I've got the code.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.629
- Oh!

15:55.699 --> 15:57.467
- Where...

15:57.468 --> 15:58.600
- Gotcha!

15:58.601 --> 15:59.870
- What the hell?

15:59.871 --> 16:02.305
- I totally had you guys
convinced I was dead.

16:02.306 --> 16:04.340
That'll teach you to value my presence.

16:04.341 --> 16:05.707
- Pierce.
- Don't Pierce me.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.578
You were going to
Vicki's party without me.

16:07.579 --> 16:09.846
Bet you didn't expect me
to fake a haunted house

16:09.847 --> 16:11.014
to teach you a lesson.

16:11.015 --> 16:13.282
- That's exactly what we expected.

16:13.283 --> 16:14.349
- for heaven's sake, Pierce,

16:14.350 --> 16:15.417
Vicki's the one that didn't invite you.

16:15.418 --> 16:16.785
Why didn't you scare her?

16:16.786 --> 16:17.788
- 'cause I hate her.

16:17.789 --> 16:19.589
- Abed, where have you been?

16:19.590 --> 16:20.956
- I found Pierce's
secret surveillance room.

16:20.957 --> 16:22.793
Did you guys know he was
faking a haunted house?

16:22.794 --> 16:25.027
- This has been Abed nadir
with the late report.

16:25.028 --> 16:26.396
- Sorry.
Good montages take time.

16:26.397 --> 16:29.465
- man, it was so easy.

16:29.466 --> 16:32.235
A few shadows,
a couple of mirror tricks.

16:32.236 --> 16:35.371
A little, custom-built
latex walls,

16:35.372 --> 16:36.905
and you're all crappin'
in your short pants.

16:36.906 --> 16:37.906
- It was pretty impressive,

16:37.907 --> 16:38.907
particularly the shadowy figure

16:38.908 --> 16:40.242
you hired to watch you sleep.

16:40.243 --> 16:41.510
- Wow, that is creepy.

16:41.511 --> 16:43.380
- A stand-out performance.
Is he sad?

16:45.282 --> 16:47.017
- Emergency lockdown.

16:47.018 --> 16:49.619
- What are you doing?
- I didn't hire anyone.

16:49.620 --> 16:51.788
- Oh, enough, Pierce.
Just open the damn door.

16:51.789 --> 16:52.788
There's no ghost.

16:52.789 --> 16:53.924
- Then how do you explain this?

16:53.925 --> 16:55.558
- You probably asked someone

16:55.559 --> 16:57.292
to help you with your stupid prank

16:57.293 --> 16:58.360
and then forgot.

16:58.361 --> 17:00.330
- Uh-Uh. Levar Burton
was a hard no.

17:00.331 --> 17:02.265
There's only one explanation.

17:02.266 --> 17:04.400
I belittled my father's
good name for a prank,

17:04.401 --> 17:07.236
and his ghost has returned to scold me

17:07.237 --> 17:09.606
and probably Butcher you guys
for going along with it.

17:09.607 --> 17:12.275
- You think hiding in this room
is gonna keep you safe?

17:12.276 --> 17:14.911
- Ghosts can't go through doors, stupid.

17:14.912 --> 17:16.311
They're not fire.

17:16.313 --> 17:18.748
- Pierce, I am paying
a teenager by the hour

17:18.749 --> 17:20.717
to care about my children
so I can go to this party,

17:20.718 --> 17:22.318
so you have to ask yourself,

17:22.319 --> 17:24.686
is the real threat out there or in here?

17:24.688 --> 17:26.255
- Fine.
I'll open it myself.

17:26.256 --> 17:28.290
- No, no.
He'll scold me!

17:28.291 --> 17:29.725
- Aah!

17:29.726 --> 17:31.626
- Someone's punching in
the code from the outside.

17:31.627 --> 17:33.463
- Please tell me one of us is outside.

17:33.464 --> 17:35.231
- Oh!

17:35.232 --> 17:37.367
- Emergency lockdown deactivated.

17:41.905 --> 17:43.606
- May I be of some assistance?

17:43.607 --> 17:45.007
Gilbert!

17:45.008 --> 17:46.608
- Gilbert, what are you
doing in my house?

17:46.609 --> 17:48.345
- Well, technically, it's my house.

17:48.346 --> 17:49.645
After our father died,

17:49.646 --> 17:51.781
I became the sole inheritor
of his estate,

17:51.782 --> 17:54.650
including all six houses and
the decommissioned submarine.

17:54.651 --> 17:55.652
- What?
- What?

17:55.653 --> 17:57.687
- So you came here to kick me out?

17:57.688 --> 17:59.456
- Actually, I came here
to give you the deed,

17:59.457 --> 18:01.557
but on the day of my arrival,
you were out.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.491
I noticed mail piled up by the door.

18:03.492 --> 18:05.395
I took it in, paid the overdue bills,

18:05.396 --> 18:08.264
replaced a few light bulbs, and, well,

18:08.265 --> 18:09.632
that was six weeks ago.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.702
- So you've been living here
in secret this whole time?

18:11.703 --> 18:12.702
- Yes.

18:12.703 --> 18:14.370
I'm ashamed to say

18:14.371 --> 18:16.873
that after a lifetime
as Cornelius's assistant,

18:16.874 --> 18:19.709
I've had a difficult time
adjusting to his passing.

18:19.710 --> 18:22.011
It seems his absence
has taken a greater toll

18:22.012 --> 18:23.512
than his presence ever did.

18:23.513 --> 18:26.349
Taking care of Pierce
gave my life purpose again,

18:26.350 --> 18:29.685
but now that I've been
discovered by your thin friend,

18:29.686 --> 18:31.888
I must apologize and bid you adieu.

18:31.889 --> 18:33.523
Good-Bye, Pierce.

18:35.893 --> 18:38.628
There's a load of clean socks
in the dryer.

18:38.629 --> 18:40.363
- Gilbert, Wait. Wait.

18:40.364 --> 18:42.932
Look, I've been doing really
well since dad died,

18:42.933 --> 18:45.368
so I don't need anyone
taking care of me,

18:45.369 --> 18:47.570
but if you're having a tough time...

18:48.739 --> 18:50.807
Well, I guess I could use a roommate.

18:52.476 --> 18:54.610
- Will there be anything else, brother?

18:54.611 --> 18:57.280
- Yes. Bring it in.

18:57.281 --> 18:59.650
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

19:03.353 --> 19:05.288
- Have fun at the party.

19:05.289 --> 19:07.256
Tell Vicki I say happy Halloween.

19:07.257 --> 19:08.290
That'll mess with her.

19:08.291 --> 19:09.324
- You sure you don't want to come?

19:09.325 --> 19:10.825
- I've got a Mask for you to wear.

19:10.826 --> 19:12.396
One that doesn't zip at the mouth.

19:12.397 --> 19:13.596
- No, thanks.

19:13.597 --> 19:15.332
I'll hang around here with Gilbert.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.766
He needs me.

19:16.767 --> 19:18.701
- Oh, that's nice.

19:18.702 --> 19:19.901
- What was all that about masks?

19:19.902 --> 19:21.305
- Don't know, don't want to.

19:21.306 --> 19:22.605
- Fair enough.

19:22.606 --> 19:25.908
Hey, how about you and I
skip out on this party?

19:25.909 --> 19:27.242
- Why? To do what
and where?

19:27.243 --> 19:28.777
- Oh, I was thinking you could show me

19:28.778 --> 19:29.844
some inspector spacetime.

19:29.845 --> 19:31.315
You're always talking about it.

19:31.316 --> 19:32.882
I've never seen a full episode.

19:32.883 --> 19:35.284
- Oh, are you sure you want to?

19:35.285 --> 19:36.551
It starts pretty slow.

19:36.552 --> 19:37.852
The first inspector
couldn't even time-Travel.

19:37.853 --> 19:39.287
- Uhh!
That sounds fine.

19:39.288 --> 19:40.757
After a night of running in circles,

19:40.758 --> 19:42.558
trying to untie Winger knots,

19:42.559 --> 19:44.361
I'm looking for something slow.

19:48.899 --> 19:51.300
- Sorry I ruined your night.

19:51.301 --> 19:53.234
- Actually, Pierce ruined my night,

19:53.235 --> 19:54.703
but you were right to let him.

19:54.704 --> 19:55.806
- You still want to go to the party?

19:55.807 --> 19:57.373
I heard Vicki bought dry ice

19:57.374 --> 19:59.408
and gave Leonard the wrong address.

19:59.409 --> 20:01.911
- Uh, I'll take a pass.
- Oh.

20:01.912 --> 20:03.847
- I have some unfinished
business at home.

20:48.263 --> 20:50.164
- Troy!

20:50.165 --> 20:52.300
Are you in here?

20:52.301 --> 20:54.969
- Abed, was that you?

20:54.970 --> 20:58.173
I want to show you something on
the other side of the bookcase.

20:59.274 --> 21:00.942
- Troy?

21:00.943 --> 21:02.945
Find me as soon as you can.

21:04.279 --> 21:08.115
- Who is in my house?

21:08.116 --> 21:09.383
Gilbert!

21:09.384 --> 21:11.920
Hijinks.

21:14.256 --> 21:16.123
- Indubitably.

21:16.124 --> 21:19.127
- Did it work?
Are you tall?

21:20.305 --> 21:26.679
