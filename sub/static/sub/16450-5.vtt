Hey, guys.
I really think we should leave.

Don't you and Karla want
to escape and go back home?

Karla can't know
there's a way off this island.

19:16.523 --> 19:18.991
It's the only way
I can win her heart.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.393
And soon, she'll see.

She'll be as madly in love
with me as I am with her.

And if that means
staying on this island forever,
