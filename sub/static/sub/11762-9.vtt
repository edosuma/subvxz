WEBVTT

00:01.232 --> 00:03.003
OKAY, THE SALES
AFTER THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR

00:03.003 --> 00:05.005
ARE GOING TO BE INSANE.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
WE'RE TALKING
FULL-ON SHOPPING ORGY.

00:07.007 --> 00:10.481
WE ARE GONNA SAVE SO MUCH MONEY
BY SPENDING MONEY.
YES, WE ARE! NOW THE KEY

00:10.481 --> 00:13.484
TO A SUCCESSFUL BLACK FRIDAY
IS THE SCOUTING TRIP,

00:13.484 --> 00:16.317
WHERE WE LOCATE, JUSTIFY
AND HIDE.

00:16.317 --> 00:20.091
OKAY? LOCATE--
THIS IS A VERY CUTE T-SHIRT.

00:20.091 --> 00:23.094
JUSTIFY--
I WOULD WEAR THIS BECAUSE...

00:23.094 --> 00:27.398
YOU COULD WEAR IT
TO BUY OTHER THINGS.
IT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THAT.

00:27.398 --> 00:30.501
YEAH, PLUS IT'S GOT THAT
REALLY COOL GUN DESIGN.
THAT'S AFRICA, LAURIE.

00:30.501 --> 00:34.335
SO DUMB.
AND FINALLY, WE HIDE IT
SO NO ONE ELSE BUYS IT

00:34.335 --> 00:36.467
BEFORE THE SALE STARTS.
I'M ON IT.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.170
OH.
SO WHO'S COMING
TO THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR?

00:39.170 --> 00:41.242
WELL, IT'S MY FIRST ONE
POST-DIVORCE,

00:41.242 --> 00:44.575
SO I KINDA WANNA KEEP IT SMALL--
TRAVIS, YOU AND ANDY.
BUT I LOVE BIG THANKSGIVINGS.

00:44.575 --> 00:48.349
YOU FILL UP YOUR HOUSE WITH
FAMILY MEMBERS YOU DON'T LIKE,

00:48.349 --> 00:50.221
PUMP THEM
FULL OF CHEAP WINE,

00:50.221 --> 00:52.223
AND YOU WATCH THEIR LIVES
FALL APART.

00:52.223 --> 00:56.257
BOBBY AND I DECIDED TO
SEPARATE LAST THANKSGIVING.
I REMEMBER.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.689
WHERE DID YOU HIDE IT?
(lowers voice) IN YOUR CAR.

00:58.689 --> 01:01.732
LAURIE, SHOPLIFTING IS NOT PART
OF "LOCATE, JUSTIFY, HIDE."

01:01.732 --> 01:04.095
(normal voice) YOU SHOP
DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO.

01:04.095 --> 01:06.597
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GO GET IT?

01:06.597 --> 01:09.100
(grunts)
I ALREADY MAILED THEM A CHECK

01:09.100 --> 01:11.372
WHICH THEY WILL RECEIVE
ON FRIDAY

01:11.372 --> 01:14.205
WHEN THIS SHIRT IS HALF-PRICE,
SO THIS ISN'T STEALING.
WHATEVER YOU NEED
TO TELL YOURSELF.

01:14.205 --> 01:16.407
JULES, I CAN COME
TO THANKSGIVING.

01:16.407 --> 01:18.279
OH, JOY.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.381
DALE HAD INVITED ME
TO HIS FOSTER MOM'S APARTMENT,

01:20.381 --> 01:23.114
BUT I'M NOT GONNA GO,
MOSTLY BECAUSE HER APARTMENT

01:23.114 --> 01:26.657
IS MORE LIKE A REHAB CENTER.
QUICK QUESTION--
DALE CAN'T COME.

01:26.657 --> 01:29.190
EVEN JUST TO--
EVEN JUST TO POKE HIS HEAD IN
AND SAY HI.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.362
BUT HE SHAVED HIS RATTAIL.
YEAH, NO.

01:31.362 --> 01:33.824
BUT HE BOUGHT REAL PANTS.
STILL NO.

01:33.824 --> 01:37.768
SO YOU'RE HAVING THE WHOLE GANG
OVER FOR TURKEY DAY, HUH?

01:37.768 --> 01:39.470
WELL...
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY PLANS,

01:39.470 --> 01:41.472
YOU KNOW,
SEEING AS MY WIFE LEFT,

01:41.472 --> 01:44.305
AND ALL OUR FRIENDS
WERE PRETTY MUCH HER FRIENDS.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.338
PLUS MY PARENTS ARE DEAD.
DID THEY DIE
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS?

01:47.338 --> 01:48.439
NO.

01:48.439 --> 01:50.381
THEN WHO CARES?
HAND ME MY DRINK.

01:50.381 --> 01:54.345
YOU DON'T HAVE TO FISH FOR
AN INVITE. I'D LOVE YOU TO COME.

01:54.345 --> 01:58.219
I GUESS I COULD PROBABLY COME.
DID YOU JUST SLAP ME
IN THE FACE WITH A "PROBABLY"?

01:58.219 --> 02:01.252
NOW IF YOU WANNA COME,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BEG FOR IT.

02:01.252 --> 02:03.154
YEAH, I'LL NEVER DO THAT.

02:03.154 --> 02:06.297
YES, HE WILL.
I KNOW. I CAN'T WAIT.

02:06.297 --> 02:08.799
SO... THERE WAS A HUGE LINE
FOR THE CAN.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.462
I HAD TO USE THE MEN'S ROOM
AND I MET A GUY.

02:11.462 --> 02:13.434
CAN HE COME TO THANKSGIVING?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.306
SHE SAID NO, STEVE!

02:17.338 --> 02:18.869
COULD'VE BEEN THE ONE.

02:18.869 --> 02:20.341
HEY, J-BIRD.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.913
NOW YOU THINK YOU CAN MAKE
REAL STUFFING THIS YEAR?

02:22.913 --> 02:24.575
THIS INSTANT STUFF'S
BUSH LEAGUE.

02:24.575 --> 02:26.447
YOU CAN'T JUST ASSUME
THAT YOU'RE INVITED.

02:26.447 --> 02:29.420
WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO EAT
ALL ALONE ON MY BOAT

02:29.420 --> 02:31.151
LIKE A OLD JAPANESE MAN?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.784
I'M JUST--I WANTED
A SMALL THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR.
NO, YOU DON'T.

02:33.784 --> 02:36.257
(bottles clink)
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I WAS
PRETENDING TO WANT A SMALL ONE

02:36.257 --> 02:38.559
SO THAT WHEN I BUCKLED
AND HAD A BIG ONE,

02:38.559 --> 02:41.662
I'D BE KNOWN AS THE HERO
WHO SAVED THANKSGIVING.
YOU THINK SO MUCH,
YOUR HEAD MUST HURT.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.464
IT DOES. IT REALLY DOES.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.165
NOT ME.
(door opens)

02:45.165 --> 02:47.598
ALWAYS FREE AND BREEZY
UP HERE, BABY.
(door closes)

02:47.598 --> 02:49.770
HEY, CAN KYLIE COME BY
TOMORROW?

02:49.770 --> 02:52.743
HER FAMILY DOESN'T REALLY
DO THANKSGIVING.
AW, BROKEN HOME?

02:52.743 --> 02:55.346
(singsong voice) FILTER, MOM.
OF COURSE KYLIE CAN COME.

02:55.346 --> 02:58.349
NOT YOUR CALL, BOBBY.
OF COURSE YOU CAN COME, KYLIE,

02:58.349 --> 03:01.352
BUT JUST KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
SIT NEXT TO ME.

03:01.352 --> 03:03.654
I'M GONNA BREAK DOWN
YOUR FAMILY A LITTLE BIT.
BRING IT, MRS. COBB.

03:03.654 --> 03:06.517
I LIKE THIS ONE.
THANKS AGAIN.

03:06.517 --> 03:08.188
VERY WELCOME, KYLIE.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.890
AGAIN, NOT FOR YOU TO SAY.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.922
YOU KNOW, THOSE TWO
ARE PRETTY TIGHT.

03:11.922 --> 03:14.395
YOU HAD THE DOINK TALK
WITH TRAV, RIGHT?
HONEY, I GOT PREGNANT
WAY TOO YOUNG.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.397
I'VE BEEN HAVING
THE DOINK TALK WITH TRAVIS

03:16.397 --> 03:18.369
EVERY 3 MONTHS
SINCE HE WAS 9.

03:18.369 --> 03:21.732
I USED TO TEACH HIM BY USING
LITTLE STUFFED ANIMALS.

03:21.732 --> 03:23.404
I'D TAPE
TINY PRIVATE PARTS ON 'EM.

03:23.404 --> 03:26.237
MAN, THAT BIT ME ON THE ASS
THAT ONE SHOW-AND-TELL DAY.

03:26.237 --> 03:28.609
YEAH, TRAV AND I HAD
THE FATHER/SON TALK

03:28.609 --> 03:30.481
WHEN HE WAS 16.
OH, WE ACTUALLY DIDN'T TALK.

03:30.481 --> 03:33.684
YOU KNOW, BUT I SHOWED HIM
HOW TO MOVE HIS HIPS.
NORMALLY, I'D BE MAD,

03:33.684 --> 03:35.686
BUT TRAVIS REALLY NEEDS
THE HELP.

03:35.686 --> 03:37.888
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HIM DANCE?
MM-HMM.

03:37.888 --> 03:40.891
IT'S LIKE HE IS
DODGING BULLETS. OOH! OOH!
(laughs)

03:40.891 --> 03:43.394
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
GREAT THANKSGIVING BLOWUP

03:43.394 --> 03:46.397
WHEN YOUR UNCLE BUD GOT DRUNK
AND TOLD YOUR COUSIN

03:46.397 --> 03:50.531
SHE WAS ADOPTED?
SHE WAS 14 AND KOREAN, ELLIE.
ON SOME LEVEL, SHE KNEW.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.463
(door opens and closes)
OH, HI, GRAYSON.

03:52.463 --> 03:55.606
DO YOU WANNA ASK ME SOMETHING?
YEAH, YOU WANNA ASK HER
SOMETHIN'?

03:55.606 --> 03:58.939
I CAN'T DO THIS.
COME ON, G-STRING. THINK OF
HOW MUCH FUN WE'RE GONNA HAVE,

03:58.939 --> 04:01.972
DRINKING BEER, DRINKING WINE
WHEN ALL THE BEER RUNS OUT.

04:01.972 --> 04:03.774
COME ON, GRAYSON.
YOU MUST BE GREAT

04:03.774 --> 04:07.348
AT SAYING THINGS YOU DON'T MEAN
TO WOMEN, LIKE "I'LL CALL YOU"

04:07.348 --> 04:10.020
OR "I'VE NEVER DONE THIS
BEFORE EITHER."

04:10.020 --> 04:13.253
FINE. (mumbles) MAY I COME OVER
FOR THANKSGIVING?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.657
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
ANSWER YOU LIKE THIS.

04:16.657 --> 04:19.490
OHH! OOH!

04:19.490 --> 04:22.633
UHH! GOD, IT'S LIKE TRYING
TO BREAK A HORSE!

04:22.633 --> 04:25.696
SHE WON'T LET GO UNTIL
YOU JUST RELAX INTO IT, MAN.

04:25.696 --> 04:28.969
(grunts)

04:28.969 --> 04:31.041
(exhales deeply)
OKAY, WE'RE DONE.

04:31.041 --> 04:33.574
(exhales deeply)

04:37.007 --> 04:39.380
A-TEAM,
WHAT'S WITH THE BURGER?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.912
TURKEY TIME'S
IN, LIKE, THREE HOURS.

04:41.912 --> 04:45.756
THANKSGIVING IS A FOOD MARATHON.
YOU HAVE TO WARM UP.

04:45.756 --> 04:48.018
(bottle cap rattles)
THIS IS LIKE... STRETCHING.

04:48.018 --> 04:49.560
WANT A BITE?

04:49.560 --> 04:51.021
NO CAN DO-SIE.

04:51.021 --> 04:54.024
JUST GOT MY CHOLESTEROL RESULTS
AND I'M ROCKING THREE BILLS.

04:54.024 --> 04:56.367
STILL COOKING EVERYTHING
IN THAT TRAVEL FRYER?

04:56.367 --> 04:57.598
G-A-C.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.299
THAT'S NOT HEALTHY.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.702
(birds cawing in distance)

05:01.702 --> 05:03.434
MMM.

05:03.434 --> 05:05.736
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
DON'T TELL JULES, ALL RIGHT?

05:05.736 --> 05:08.439
SHE'LL GET ALL WORRIED
AND CARETAKE-Y.

05:08.439 --> 05:10.611
THAT INFO IS LOCKED UP.

05:10.611 --> 05:14.985
ALL RIGHT? NOW HIDE THAT KEY
WHERE I'LL NEVER FIND IT.

05:14.985 --> 05:18.489
I DON'T HAVE TO.
I TRUST YOU THAT MUCH.

05:18.489 --> 05:19.650
WOW.

05:23.924 --> 05:24.995
(door opens)

05:24.995 --> 05:27.498
WHAT YOU GOT
IN YOUR HAND THERE, CHAMP?

05:27.498 --> 05:28.529
(door closes)

05:28.529 --> 05:32.332
IT'S JUST A... TINY PRETEND KEY?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.505
OKAY, AHEM. EXCUSE ME.

05:34.505 --> 05:35.936
QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT.

05:35.936 --> 05:39.570
I'M ABOUT TO BRING KYLIE IN,
SO I NEED YOU ALL TO ACT

05:39.570 --> 05:42.513
LIKE NORMAL HUMAN BEINGS.

05:42.513 --> 05:45.576
BOO!
I KNOW. IT'S GONNA BE HARD,
BUT I CAN HELP.

05:45.576 --> 05:47.518
MRS. TORRES, KYLIE DOESN'T
HAVE AN EATING DISORDER.

05:47.518 --> 05:50.381
SHE RUNS CROSS-COUNTRY.
THINK OF A NEW OPENING QUESTION.

05:50.381 --> 05:52.653
MR. TORRES, I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH YOU EAT, LET'S KEEP

05:52.653 --> 05:55.626
OUR PANTS BUTTONED. LAURIE, YOUR
BREASTS ARE BIGGER THAN HERS.

05:55.626 --> 05:56.987
THERE. I SAID IT.
YOU DON'T NEED TO TELL HER.

05:56.987 --> 05:58.659
NEIGHBOR GUY,
I SEE YOU BROUGHT

05:58.659 --> 06:00.861
YOUR FRUITY LITTLE GUITAR.
LET'S KEEP THAT HOLSTERED.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.863
MOM, YOU HAVE
MULTIPLE PROBLEM AREAS,

06:02.863 --> 06:05.636
SO WHEN IN DOUBT, JUST SAY TO
YOURSELF, "THAT'S A BAD IDEA."

06:05.636 --> 06:07.768
AND, DAD, I THINK
WE BOTH KNOW IT'S BEST

06:07.768 --> 06:09.870
YOU JUST DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.572
(clicks teeth)

06:11.572 --> 06:13.574
THAT WAS A LITTLE SNARKY.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.945
YEAH, HE'S JUST NERVOUS.

06:14.945 --> 06:18.479
IT'S THE FIRST TIME HE'S BROUGHT
A GIRL TO A FAMILY THING.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.582
SO I THINK WE ALL KNOW
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.614
...THE WHOLE, UH...

06:23.614 --> 06:25.456
HELLO?

06:25.456 --> 06:26.887
MOM?

06:26.887 --> 06:29.620
в™Є HI, KYLIE в™Є

06:29.620 --> 06:31.762
(continues strumming guitar)
в™Є HI, KYLIE в™Є

06:31.762 --> 06:34.094
(both, off-key) в™Є HI, KYLIE в™Є

06:34.094 --> 06:35.796
HI, KYLIE.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.498
MOM...

06:37.498 --> 06:39.770
NO, NO. THERE'S A BIG FINISH.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

06:39.770 --> 06:45.005
(all) в™Є HI, KYLIE в™Є

06:45.005 --> 06:46.837
(Bobby) WHOO!
UNBELIEVABLE.

06:46.837 --> 06:50.110
OH, COOL IT. SHE'S STILL HERE,
AREN'T YOU, KYLIE?

06:50.110 --> 06:52.082
в™Єв™Є

07:01.892 --> 07:04.555
KYLIE, AWESOME JOB SURVIVING
THE FIRST WAVE OF EMBARRASSMENT.

07:04.555 --> 07:07.698
I JUST GRITTED MY TEETH
AND WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

07:07.698 --> 07:09.700
THATTAGIRL.
I'LL GRAB YOU A SODA.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.733
FOR YOU LADIES, I ASSUME
TWO GIANT BUCKETS OF WINE?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.905
RED, PLEASE.

07:14.905 --> 07:17.468
HALF RED, HALF WHITE.

07:17.468 --> 07:19.610
WHAT? IT'S REALLY GOOD.

07:19.610 --> 07:23.143
AND THAT IS A VERY CUTE
TOP.

07:23.143 --> 07:26.917
I MEAN, I CLEARLY COULDN'T WEAR
IT BECAUSE OF THESE PUPPIES,

07:26.917 --> 07:28.519
BUT...
OKAY.

07:28.519 --> 07:31.021
LEAVE HER ALONE.
THAT'S A NICE NECKLACE.

07:31.021 --> 07:33.223
ARE YOUR PARENTS RICH?

07:33.223 --> 07:34.955
HERE YOU GO.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.758
OH, THANKS. MMM.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.591
AHH. THAT FIRST SIP--

07:40.591 --> 07:42.893
BURNS YOUR THROAT
JUST A LITTLE BIT,

07:42.893 --> 07:46.466
BUT THEN WHEN IT HITS YOUR HEAD,
IT'S LIKE, "OH, YEAH."

07:46.466 --> 07:47.998
JULES COBB ON DRINKING.

07:47.998 --> 07:50.601
SO... KYLIE SEEMS SWEET.

07:50.601 --> 07:52.002
SHE'S PRETTY GREAT.

07:52.002 --> 07:54.204
YEAH. ARE YOU HAVING SEX?

07:54.204 --> 07:57.077
WOW! JUST DIVING RIGHT IN.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.079
COURAGE. OH, COME ON.
WE'RE NOT LIKE

07:59.079 --> 08:01.481
OTHER MOTHER/SON COMBOS.
WE'RE FRIENDS.

08:01.481 --> 08:05.155
I KNOW, BUT... ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANNA GO DOWN THAT ROAD?

08:05.155 --> 08:07.618
I THINK IT'LL BE FUN.

08:07.618 --> 08:10.160
ALL RIGHT, WELL...

08:10.160 --> 08:12.693
YEAH, I THINK KYLIE, UH,

08:12.693 --> 08:15.495
KYLIE COULD BE...
THE ONE.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.067
AW.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.899
BUT I'M REALLY NERVOUS
BECAUSE I...

08:18.899 --> 08:22.703
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY...
FIRST TIME? AW. OKAY, UM,

08:22.703 --> 08:25.706
DO YOU MIND IF I PUT THE FRIEND
THING ON HOLD FOR A SECOND

08:25.706 --> 08:28.178
AND GET ON THAT MOM TRAIN?
I'LL ALLOW IT.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.881
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE 18
AND YOU'RE GONNA DO

08:30.881 --> 08:33.083
WHAT YOU WANNA DO, BUT, OH,
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT TALK

08:33.083 --> 08:35.285
WE HAD ABOUT
JUST BEING READY EMOTIONALLY,

08:35.285 --> 08:38.048
AND OH, MY GOD, PROTECTION.
DO YOU WANT ME TO SHOW YOU HOW

08:38.048 --> 08:41.121
TO PUT A CONDOM ON AGAIN? 'CAUSE
WE CAN GET THE ROLLING PIN.
I'M GOOD.

08:41.121 --> 08:45.155
PLUS THE ROLLING PIN MADE ME
FEEL KINDA BAD ABOUT MYSELF.
OH, I'M SORRY.
OH, OF COURSE IT DID.

08:45.155 --> 08:46.997
WELL, THANKS FOR BEING
SO COOL, MOM.

08:46.997 --> 08:51.031
NO PROBLEM. HEY, WAIT.
YOU JUST CALLED ME COOL.

08:51.031 --> 08:54.034
YOU MIND
IF I TELL EVERYONE THAT?
GO NUTS.
THE GUYS ARE GONE, THOUGH.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.536
IT'S THEIR ANNUAL
"LET'S PRETEND WE'RE NOT OLD"

08:56.536 --> 08:58.569
BASKETBALL GAME
AGAINST THE NEIGHBORS.

08:58.569 --> 09:00.841
(Kenny Loggins'
"Playing with the Boys" playing)

09:00.841 --> 09:03.914
(cheering in slow motion)

09:05.245 --> 09:08.919
в™Є PLAYING,
PLAYING WITH THE BOYS в™Є

09:08.919 --> 09:11.682
(grunting in slow motion)

09:11.682 --> 09:13.854
YES!
в™Є PLAYING в™Є

09:13.854 --> 09:16.957
в™Є PLAYING WITH THE BOYS в™Є

09:16.957 --> 09:19.289
в™Єв™Є

09:19.289 --> 09:24.765
в™Є ONE OF LIFE'S SIMPLE JOYS
IS PLAYING WITH THE BOYS в™Є

09:24.765 --> 09:27.998
(cheering)

09:27.998 --> 09:30.000
CALM DOWN.
WE'RE STILL UP BY 3.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.873
SHUT UP, LISA!
ANDY, COME HERE.
GET OVER HERE.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.175
ALL RIGHT, DON'T GET SUCKED
INTO HER TRASH TALK.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.678
THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.
NOW IF WE BEAR DOWN,

09:37.678 --> 09:40.711
WE CAN WIN THIS THING.
YEAH, HOPE SO. MY GUY'S SHOES
LIGHT UP WHEN HE JUMPS.

09:40.711 --> 09:41.882
ALL RIGHT.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.184
HANDS IN. LET'S LEAVE IT
ALL OUT THERE.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.787
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
ONE, TWO, THREE, WIN!

09:46.787 --> 09:47.818
TEAM!
DEFENSE.

09:47.818 --> 09:49.259
(clink)
(both) YES!

09:49.259 --> 09:51.261
AND I'LL SAY IT.
I'M GLAD WE WON,

09:51.261 --> 09:53.964
BUT I'M EVEN HAPPIER
LISA SPRAINED HER ANKLE.

09:53.964 --> 09:55.966
REMEMBER THIS DAY, ANDY?

09:55.966 --> 10:00.030
I'M GONNA RAISE
THIS SUMMER SAUSAGE TO YOU.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.872
NOPE. NO MORE FATTY FOODS
FOR YOU.

10:01.872 --> 10:03.904
YOU CAN'T DIE YET.
TRAVIS NEEDS YOU,

10:03.904 --> 10:06.136
AND I DON'T HAVE
A GREAT BLACK DRESS.
YOU TOLD HER?

10:06.136 --> 10:10.040
OH, CALM DOWN, GRAVY VEINS.
HE TOLD ME. I TOLD HER.
WHY?

10:10.040 --> 10:12.743
BECAUSE I WANNA GET
THIS PAR-TAY STARTED.

10:12.743 --> 10:15.285
COME ON. HE BETRAYED YOU. GO.

10:15.285 --> 10:18.819
SORRY, MAN. WHEN I TRY
TO KEEP A SECRET FROM ELLIE,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.752
I-I GET HEARTBURN,
AND JUST, IT HURTS SO BAD.

10:21.752 --> 10:23.223
OFF THE COUCH.

10:27.157 --> 10:31.161
GOD BLESS US, EVERYONE.
I DO NOT KNOW HOW ANDY DOES IT.

10:31.161 --> 10:34.034
NO OFFENSE, BUT I COULD NOT BE
WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.336
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD LIKE ME
THANKS YOU.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.169
I GUESS YOU'LL HAVE TO STICK
WITH THOSE...
(door opens)

10:39.169 --> 10:41.071
MIDDLE-AGED GOLF BIDDIES
WHO ARE WILLING TO SPRING

10:41.071 --> 10:43.874
FOR TACOS
IN EXCHANGE FOR HUMAN TOUCH.
(door closes)

10:43.874 --> 10:46.917
HEY, ELLIE, HAPPY THANKSGIVING.
AND, YOU, ENOUGH
WITH THE 20-SOMETHING BIMBOS.

10:46.917 --> 10:48.048
IT'S PATHETIC.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.182
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

10:52.182 --> 10:57.257
OKAY, THIS TURKEY SHOULD BE
DONE IN ABOUT 17 MORE HOURS.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.191
SO... YOU AND KYLIE JUST
CHILLING IN THE BEDROOM?

11:01.191 --> 11:04.394
OKAY, WEIRD.
I'M NOT BEING WEIRD.
YOU BE WEIRD.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.096
IT'S NOT GONNA BE TONIGHT.

11:06.096 --> 11:08.038
I KNOW, SILLY.

11:08.038 --> 11:10.400
IT'S GONNA BE TOMORROW,
WHEN HER PARENTS GO AWAY.

11:12.242 --> 11:13.403
OH.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.809
TOMORROW. MY SON'S GONNA BE
MAKING LOVE TOMORROW.

11:18.809 --> 11:20.680
CONGRATULATIONS?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.213
I KNOW WHEN IT'S GONNA BE
AND WHERE,

11:23.213 --> 11:25.716
AND NOW THAT BOBBY
TAUGHT HIM HIS HIP THING,

11:25.716 --> 11:27.718
I EVEN KNOW THE BASIC RHYTHM.

11:27.718 --> 11:30.020
ONE AND TWO AND ONE, TWO, THREE
AND ONE AND TWO AND PAUSE.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.863
DALE IS JUST LIKE, ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE, BAM!

11:32.863 --> 11:34.164
AND THEN HE FARTS.

11:34.164 --> 11:36.196
LATER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:36.196 --> 11:38.899
TRAVIS--YOU'VE HAD
A MILLION TALKS WITH HIM,

11:38.899 --> 11:40.931
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
IN ONE OF OUR FRIEND TALKS,

11:40.931 --> 11:43.734
HE TOLD ME SHE'S NOT EVEN
ON THE PILL.

11:43.734 --> 11:47.077
CONDOMS BREAK ALL THE TIME!
ESPECIALLY IF
THERE'S PIERCINGS INVOLVED.

11:47.077 --> 11:49.139
STOP. I'M BEGGING YOU.

11:49.139 --> 11:51.141
I'M GONNA BE A GRANDMOTHER
AT 41!

11:51.141 --> 11:54.084
THEY'RE GONNA PUT ME
ON THE NEWS.
KEEP IT TOGETHER, SWEETIE.

11:54.084 --> 11:56.146
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
(gasps)

11:56.146 --> 11:57.888
WHAT KIND OF MOTHER LETS
HER DAUGHTER

11:57.888 --> 12:01.721
WEAR A SLUTTY CARDIGAN LIKE THAT
WITHOUT PUTTING HER ON THE PILL?

12:01.721 --> 12:04.054
(whispers) WHORE!

12:04.054 --> 12:08.098
I'M NOT PROUD THAT SOMETIMES
I HOOK UP WITH WOMEN FOR FOOD.

12:08.098 --> 12:10.430
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
EVERY 24-YEAR-OLD ON EARTH

12:10.430 --> 12:13.804
HAS A DADDY COMPLEX
AND THINKS MY NAME'S EXOTIC.

12:13.804 --> 12:16.967
(chuckles) STILL, WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S NOT FOREVER.
HELL, NO.

12:16.967 --> 12:19.209
SOMEDAY I'M GONNA FIND ME
A REAL WOMAN--

12:19.209 --> 12:21.211
SOMEONE WHO LOOKS AFTER ME.

12:21.211 --> 12:25.075
YEAH, AND SOMEONE THAT HELPS
GET ME OUT OF MY SHELL.
I DON'T WANNA END UP ALONE.

12:25.075 --> 12:26.917
THAT WOULD KILL ME.

12:26.917 --> 12:29.950
OH, WHOA!
"GETTING DEEP" ALERT.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.151
(laughs)

12:31.151 --> 12:32.252
UGH!

12:32.252 --> 12:33.383
(chuckles)

12:33.383 --> 12:36.386
PERMISSION TO SPEAK.

12:36.386 --> 12:38.228
PROCEED.

12:38.228 --> 12:41.932
DO YOU THINK THE WOMAN YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IS EVEN OUT THERE?

12:41.932 --> 12:44.264
(male announcer
speaking indistinctly on TV)

12:44.264 --> 12:46.236
DEFINITELY.
YEAH.

12:48.098 --> 12:49.539
OH, MY CHEST.

12:53.844 --> 12:57.808
OH, GOOD.
YOU'RE ON THE BED.

12:57.808 --> 13:00.210
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
IS IT A WATER BALLOON?

13:00.210 --> 13:03.213
CLOSE. IT'S A CONDOM
FILLED WITH WATER.

13:03.213 --> 13:05.255
THAT IS NOT GOOD NEWS.

13:05.255 --> 13:08.018
I MEAN, PEOPLE THINK
THAT CONDOMS ARE FOOLPROOF,

13:08.018 --> 13:10.390
BUT THEY'RE NOT.
THESE THINGS CAN BREAK.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.163
(squeaking)

13:16.326 --> 13:19.129
(water gurgling)

13:19.129 --> 13:21.571
(clatter)
OKAY. THEY MAY NOT BREAK
RIGHT AWAY,

13:21.571 --> 13:23.373
BUT, YOU KNOW,
ONCE YOU GET STARTED,

13:23.373 --> 13:26.036
THIS COULD HAPPEN.

13:26.036 --> 13:27.377
COME ON!

13:27.377 --> 13:29.039
ALL RIGHT.

13:29.039 --> 13:31.311
THIS ISN'T FAIR
BECAUSE THIS IS A-A BALLOON

13:31.311 --> 13:34.114
THAT I GOT AT A TOY STORE,
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

13:34.114 --> 13:36.516
WEIRD TO USE A REAL CONDOM.
YOU THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE WEIRD?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.519
WHY WON'T YOU BREAK?!
NO ONE'S GONNA STOMP ON IT,
MOM.

13:39.519 --> 13:43.353
WHY IS SHE DOING THIS?
I'M SORRY, KYLIE. IT'S, UM,
I TALKED TO TRAVIS,

13:43.353 --> 13:46.356
AND I-I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT
TOMORROW NIGHT'S THE BIG NIGHT.
(door opens and closes)

13:46.356 --> 13:49.399
TRAVIS?!
I WAS JUST RAPPING
WITH MY BOY THERE,

13:49.399 --> 13:52.332
AND, UH, TELL HER I'M COOL.
I'M SO COOL.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.534
I-I THINK I SHOULD
JUST GO HOME.

13:54.534 --> 13:58.138
WOW.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.240
I TRUSTED YOU.

14:05.515 --> 14:07.918
(gasps)

14:07.918 --> 14:09.579
OF COURSE.

14:15.956 --> 14:18.028
THAT WAS
THE WORST SEX TALK EVER. (sighs)

14:18.028 --> 14:20.430
I'M A HORRIBLE MOM.

14:20.430 --> 14:25.865
OH. MAKE ME FEEL BETTER,
GRAYSON.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.339
(strangled voice)
I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON STAN.

14:29.339 --> 14:32.002
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING
MORE UNCOMFORTABLE

14:32.002 --> 14:35.906
THAN WHAT I JUST
PUT TRAVIS THROUGH?

14:35.906 --> 14:38.208
ACTUALLY,
I CAN THINK OF--
I CAN.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.181
LET'S GO PLAY SOME HOOPS.
YOU WANNA GO PLAY SOME HOOPS?

14:41.181 --> 14:43.883
HOOPS? MAN, THAT'S
MY MIDDLE NAME, IS HOOPS.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.056
I LOVE HOOPS.
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

14:46.056 --> 14:48.658
I MEAN, TRAVIS WAS NEVER GREAT
WITH THE LADIES.
(door opens and closes)

14:48.658 --> 14:51.661
WHEN HE WAS 12,
HE MET THIS GIRL AT CAMP,

14:51.661 --> 14:54.164
AND HE USED TO WRITE HER
ALL THESE LOVE LETTERS.

14:54.164 --> 14:57.167
BUT THE ADDRESS SHE GAVE HIM
WAS TO A DOG TOY FACTORY

14:57.167 --> 15:00.170
IN WISCONSIN, SO THE LETTERS
KEPT GETTING RETURNED.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.402
I DIDN'T WANT HIS HEART
TO BREAK,

15:02.402 --> 15:05.235
SO I STARTED TO WRITE HIM BACK.
I FINALLY HAD TO BREAK UP

15:05.235 --> 15:08.138
WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HIT PUBERTY
AND STARTED MAILING ME PICTURES

15:08.138 --> 15:11.141
AND ASKING ME
TO DO SOME WEIRD STUFF.
THIS IS GONNA BLOW OVER,

15:11.141 --> 15:14.144
AND TRAVIS JUST WON'T TALK
TO YOU FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

15:14.144 --> 15:16.146
NO! I'M THE HERO
WHO SAVED THANKSGIVING.

15:16.146 --> 15:18.418
I HAVE TO FIX THIS NOW.

15:18.418 --> 15:22.022
I JUST GOTTA GET KYLIE
NOT TO LEAVE.
THIS IS HER PURSE.

15:22.022 --> 15:26.026
SHE'S NOT GONNA LEAVE
WITHOUT HER PURSE.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.557
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:27.557 --> 15:29.429
LOCATE, JUSTIFY, HIDE,
ELLIE.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.661
LOCATE--I GOT IT.

15:31.661 --> 15:34.034
JUSTIFY--I GOTTA DO IT.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.335
HIDE--I'M ON IT.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.406
(squeals)

15:38.508 --> 15:41.211
WHY DO WE HAVE TO HIDE
THE BAG OUTSIDE?

15:41.211 --> 15:43.213
BECAUSE TRAVIS HAS FOUND
EVERY PRESENT

15:43.213 --> 15:45.515
I EVER HID FROM HIM
EXCEPT FOR THE ONES

15:45.515 --> 15:47.217
BURIED IN THIS BACKYARD.

15:47.217 --> 15:50.220
NOW WE GOTTA GRAB A SHOVEL
AND REMEMBER WHERE WE PUT IT.

15:50.220 --> 15:52.983
THERE'S STILL A DISCMAN BURIED
HERE SOMEWHERE. HERE YOU GO.

15:52.983 --> 15:55.025
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA BURY
MY PURSE?

15:55.025 --> 15:56.526
(loud clank)

16:00.360 --> 16:03.133
WHY ARE YOUR BOYFRIENDS
ACTING SO WEIRD?

16:03.133 --> 16:05.465
FIRST OF ALL,
ONLY BOBBY'S MY BOYFRIEND,

16:05.465 --> 16:09.039
AND THEY'RE NOT...
ACTING WEIRD.

16:09.039 --> 16:11.241
(Kenny Loggins) в™Є PLAYING в™Є

16:11.241 --> 16:12.542
в™Є WITH THE BOYS в™Є

16:12.542 --> 16:15.575
в™Є PLAYING WITH THE BOYS в™Є

16:15.575 --> 16:18.208
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE ON THE SAME TEAM, RIGHT?

16:18.208 --> 16:20.080
SHUT UP, LISA!
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
LISA!

16:20.080 --> 16:21.211
FOUL!

16:21.211 --> 16:24.214
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.
NORMALLY, I'D WAIT

16:24.214 --> 16:27.217
FOR THAT CHEST GAS
TO PUSH IT ON OUT OF YOU.

16:27.217 --> 16:30.160
BUT THIS SEEMS TOO JUICY.
YOU CAN'T MAKE ME TELL.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.462
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN
WE USED TO HAVE SEX

16:32.462 --> 16:35.525
IN INAPPROPRIATE PLACES?

16:35.525 --> 16:38.198
NOT IN FRONT OF STAN.
WAKE UP!

16:38.198 --> 16:41.631
LIKE BABY RICK'S
3rd BIRTHDAY PARTY...

16:41.631 --> 16:44.574
(groans)
WHEN YOU TOOK ME
AGAINST THE BOUNCY HOUSE?

16:44.574 --> 16:47.277
(moans)

16:47.277 --> 16:49.239
GET A HOLD OF THESE.

16:49.239 --> 16:51.081
OHH.

16:51.081 --> 16:53.113
MOM?

16:53.113 --> 16:55.145
HOW'S THAT FEEL,
MR. TORRES?

16:55.145 --> 16:56.286
DO YOU LIKE THAT?

16:56.286 --> 16:59.319
I DO LIKE IT. I DO.
YEAH?

16:59.319 --> 17:03.153
OH.
BUT THANKS FOR SAVING ME.

17:03.153 --> 17:04.454
YOU WILL TELL ME!

17:04.454 --> 17:07.497
IT'S WEIRD THAT YOU WON'T
GIVE ME MY PURSE BACK.

17:07.497 --> 17:09.529
WELL, IF I DO,
ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE?

17:09.529 --> 17:12.432
YES.
BUT I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.435
AND I PROMISE, I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE,

17:15.435 --> 17:18.108
BECAUSE IF I START TO SAY
ANYTHING CRAZY,

17:18.108 --> 17:20.640
LAURIE IS GONNA STOP ME.
OH, YES! I CAN JUST MAKE
A NOISE OR SOMETHING.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.312
FINE.

17:22.312 --> 17:24.314
KYLIE, THIS IS MY FAULT.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.316
I MEAN, TRAVIS AND I
ARE SO TIGHT,

17:26.316 --> 17:28.718
THAT THE LINE
BETWEEN FRIEND AND MOTHER

17:28.718 --> 17:32.051
HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE BLURRY.
UP UNTIL A FEW YEARS AGO,

17:32.051 --> 17:34.254
HE WAS TAKING NAPS IN MY BED.
BAAH!

17:34.254 --> 17:37.257
THANK YOU. NOW THE POINT IS,
IS THAT TRAVIS CONFIDED IN ME,

17:37.257 --> 17:41.761
AND I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
I-I JUST WISH HE HADN'T
TOLD YOU EVERYTHING.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.435
IT'S JUST AWKWARD FOR HIM.
YOU KNOW, HE'S STILL A VIRGIN.

17:45.435 --> 17:47.597
HE TOLD ME HE WASN'T.

17:47.597 --> 17:49.599
OH, GOD.
WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP ME?

17:49.599 --> 17:52.402
(coughs) I REALLY THOUGHT
I HAD TIME TO TAKE A SIP.

17:52.402 --> 17:54.404
CLEARLY NOT. (coughs)

17:54.404 --> 17:58.348
ALL RIGHT, KYLIE,
IF YOU GO, I UNDERSTAND.

17:58.348 --> 18:00.850
BUT I HOPE YOU STAY
FOR TRAVIS,

18:00.850 --> 18:02.752
'CAUSE HE REALLY CARES
ABOUT YOU.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.416
COME ON, SWEETIE.

18:08.318 --> 18:11.161
PLEASE DON'T TORTURE HIM
THE WAY MY MOM TORTURES ME.

18:11.161 --> 18:13.463
I GOTTA SAY, I'M LOVING
THIS THANKSGIVING DRAMA

18:13.463 --> 18:15.495
YOU TWO HAVE GOING ON.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.467
GLAD I COULD HELP.

18:17.467 --> 18:19.769
WOULD YOU STOP WITH THIS
END OF THE WORLD NONSENSE?

18:19.769 --> 18:22.772
YOU AND THIS GIRL ARE GONNA BOND
OVER HOW HORRIBLE YOUR MOM IS,

18:22.772 --> 18:25.705
AND YOU'LL GET IN HER PANTS
WITHIN A WEEK.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.477
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO BEAUTIFUL.

18:27.477 --> 18:30.180
LOOK, PARENTING DOESN'T
COME NATURALLY TO ME.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.242
LUCKILY,
ANDY'S A GREAT DAD.

18:32.242 --> 18:34.144
HE WOULD'VE BEEN
A GREAT WOMAN.

18:34.144 --> 18:35.845
HE WOULD'VE LOVED
BREAST-FEEDING.

18:35.845 --> 18:38.318
I REALLY WOULD HAVE.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.620
I NEED YOU TO CUT
YOUR MOM SOME SLACK.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.353
I HAVE A LOT RIDING ON THIS
RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE WITH HER.

18:43.353 --> 18:45.795
I'M BASING MY WHOLE
PARENTING STRATEGY AROUND IT.

18:45.795 --> 18:47.457
WORST DECISION EVER.

18:47.457 --> 18:48.798
PLEASE.

18:48.798 --> 18:51.661
AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO
THAT IN THE END,

18:51.661 --> 18:53.663
YOUR MOM ALWAYS
COMES THROUGH FOR YOU.

18:53.663 --> 18:56.706
HEY, TRAV,
YOU WANNA TALK?

18:56.706 --> 19:00.410
SURE.
(Noah and the Whale) в™Є CAN GET
A LITTLE LOVE OF YOUR OWN в™Є

19:00.410 --> 19:02.772
в™Є DON'T BREAK HIS HEART в™Є

19:02.772 --> 19:04.774
GOT A LITTLE INTENSE
OUT THERE, HUH?

19:04.774 --> 19:07.717
AT ONE POINT, I STRAIGHT
PUNCHED YOU IN THE FACE.

19:07.717 --> 19:09.719
DON'T GET BLOOD
ON MY FROZEN CORN.

19:09.719 --> 19:13.253
IF ANYBODY'S STILL HERE,
WE'RE EATING IN 20 MINUTES.
MAN, THIS IS DICEY.

19:13.253 --> 19:16.256
SHOULD WE JUST TRY
TO HASH IT OUT?
PROBABLY, BUT THEN AGAIN,
YOU KNOW,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.428
IT FEELS LIKE
WE'D BE TALKING ABOUT

19:18.428 --> 19:20.930
SOMETHING WAY IN THE FUTURE,
YOU KNOW, LIKE YEARS.
YEAH, WHO KNOWS HOW
WE'LL FEEL BY THEN?

19:20.930 --> 19:24.294
HELL, ONE OF US
MAY EVEN BE DEAD.
YEAH,
AND WITH YOUR CHOLESTEROL...

19:24.294 --> 19:26.666
OH, YEAH, IT'LL BE ME.
LOOK, I SAY WE ACT LIKE MEN

19:26.666 --> 19:29.669
AND WE BURY IT UNDER A MOUNTAIN
OF DENIAL SO DEEP

19:29.669 --> 19:33.203
THAT NO ONE CAN MAKE US BELIEVE
THAT IT EVER ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

19:33.203 --> 19:36.506
ALREADY DONE. FREE AND BREEZY.
WANT A BEER?

19:36.506 --> 19:39.509
I'LL HAVE TWO.
NICE.

19:39.509 --> 19:42.512
в™Єв™Є

19:55.665 --> 19:57.897
в™Є WELL, IF YOU ARE в™Є
в™Є WHAT YOU LOVE в™Є

19:57.897 --> 19:59.629
в™Є AND YOU DO в™Є
в™Є WHAT YOU'VE LOVE в™Є

19:59.629 --> 20:04.234
в™Є I WILL ALWAYS BE
THE SUN AND MOON TO YOU в™Є

20:04.234 --> 20:05.975
в™Є AND IF YOU SHARE в™Є
в™Є WITH YOUR HEART в™Є

20:05.975 --> 20:08.508
в™Є YEAH, YOU GIVE в™Є
в™Є WITH YOUR HEART в™Є

20:08.508 --> 20:10.510
в™Є WHAT YOU SHARE
WITH THE WORLD... в™Є

20:10.510 --> 20:13.243
OKAY, QUICK DISCLAIMER--
WHEN WE ATTACK THE FOOD,

20:13.243 --> 20:15.715
LET'S CHEW CAREFULLY
BECAUSE I'M MISSING AN EARRING.

20:15.715 --> 20:19.419
OKAY, GRAB A HAND. GOD, THIS IS
MY FAVORITE PART OF THANKSGIVING

20:19.419 --> 20:20.820
'CAUSE I GET TO SAY WHAT
I'M THANKFUL FOR.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.723
DO WE HAVE TO HOLD HANDS
THE WHOLE TIME?
YES, YOU DO.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.456
OKAY, FOR ME,
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT FAMILY,

20:26.456 --> 20:28.828
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
JUST BLOOD,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.830
BECAUSE IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.533
FAMILY IS ALL ABOUT
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU CHOOSE

20:33.533 --> 20:36.436
TO LET INTO YOUR LIFE.
FAMILY'S ABOUT SUPPORT

20:36.436 --> 20:38.508
AND WORKING THROUGH THINGS,

20:38.508 --> 20:41.341
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN CARE
SO MUCH,

20:41.341 --> 20:43.643
YOU CAN SCREAM AND FIGHT
JUST AS EASILY

20:43.643 --> 20:45.715
AS YOU CAN MAKE LOVE.

20:45.715 --> 20:46.716
(imitates buzzer)

20:46.716 --> 20:49.649
YEAH, GOOD--GOOD CALL. UM...

20:49.649 --> 20:51.651
ANYWAY, I'M JUST REALLY THANKFUL

20:51.651 --> 20:54.354
THAT YOU'RE ALL
A PART OF MY LIFE. I AM.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.686
I LOVE YOU GUYS. LET'S EAT.

20:56.686 --> 20:57.887
YAY!

20:57.887 --> 21:00.960
(indistinct conversations)

21:08.668 --> 21:10.900
ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME YET?

21:10.900 --> 21:12.902
(strangled voice)
NO, I CAN'T.

21:12.902 --> 21:14.904
IT'S FINE. I CAN WAIT.

21:14.904 --> 21:17.807
OH, GOD,
JUST RELEASE THIS PRESSURE.

21:17.807 --> 21:21.751
IS IT ABOUT GRAYSON
OR BOBBY?

21:21.751 --> 21:24.354
OOH, NO, NO, NO.

21:24.354 --> 21:25.785
YOU'LL BREAK EVENTUALLY.

21:25.785 --> 21:31.521
OH, OH! JUST LET ME DIE!
(coughs)

21:31.521 --> 21:36.626
OW!
OH, YOU'RE A CRUEL WOMAN!

21:36.626 --> 21:38.628
OH, BUT I LOVE YOU, DEAR.
