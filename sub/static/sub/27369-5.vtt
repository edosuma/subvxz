02:30.651 --> 02:33.278
Bill Peterson:<i> On the night</i>
<i>of December 7th 1982,</i>

02:33.362 --> 02:35.155
<i>did you have an occasion to see him?</i>

02:35.364 --> 02:36.406
Glen Gore: <i>Yes.</i>

02:36.490 --> 02:37.866
<i>And where was that?</i>

02:37.949 --> 02:39.409
<i>It was at the Coachlight.</i>

02:40.661 --> 02:42.454
Bill Peterson:Â <i>Do you know-- Did you hear</i>

02:42.537 --> 02:46.083
<i>or do you know if Ron Williamson...</i>
<i>What he said to Mrs. Carter?</i>

02:46.166 --> 02:47.959
<i>No. I was just walking by.</i>

02:48.043 --> 02:50.504
<i>She tapped me on the shoulder</i>
<i>and said, "Save me."</i>

05:26.076 --> 05:27.077
Bill Peterson: <i>Do you know a person</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:29.204
<i>who's become known to you</i>
<i>as Debbie Carter?</i>

05:29.287 --> 05:30.163
Glen Gore: <i>Yes.</i>

05:30.247 --> 05:31.456
Bill Peterson: <i>How long have you known</i>
<i>Debbie Carter?</i>

05:31.540 --> 05:33.083
<i>We went to school together.</i>

05:33.166 --> 05:34.584
<i>I've known her a long time.</i>

05:34.751 --> 05:36.211
<i>Practically all my life.</i>

05:36.294 --> 05:37.921
Bill Peterson: <i>And are you a friend</i>
<i>of hers?</i>

05:38.004 --> 05:38.839
Yes.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.059
Reporter: <i>How close did you come</i>
<i>to being executed?</i>

24:47.820 --> 24:50.239
George Butner: <i>I did not know</i>

24:50.322 --> 24:53.367
<i>that there had been</i>
<i>threatening phone calls</i>

24:53.450 --> 24:57.496
<i>to Ms. Haraway while she was working</i>
<i>at McAnally's</i>

24:57.579 --> 25:01.750
<i>because the first thing that would pop</i>
<i>into my mind is...</i>

25:01.834 --> 25:03.293
<i>that's another suspect.</i>

25:04.128 --> 25:05.254
Lawyer: <i>Never had knowledge of that?</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:06.714
George Butner:
<i>Never had knowledge of that.</i>

25:06.797 --> 25:08.340
Lawyer: <i>That certainly</i>
<i>would have been evidence</i>

25:08.424 --> 25:09.717
<i>that you would have found useful?</i>

25:09.800 --> 25:10.843
George Butner: <i>Yes.</i>

25:10.926 --> 25:14.888
Lawyer: <i>And would you agree with me</i>
<i>that's because it's exculpatory material?</i>

25:15.097 --> 25:16.890
George Butner:
<i>It points the finger elsewhere.</i>

25:16.974 --> 25:18.767
Lawyer: <i>It's favorable to Mr. Fontenot?</i>

25:18.851 --> 25:19.727
George Butner: <i>Yes.</i>

25:19.810 --> 25:22.521
Lawyer: <i>It was material to your ability</i>
<i>to present that defense?</i>

25:22.604 --> 25:23.439
George Butner: <i>Yes.</i>

29:28.934 --> 29:31.770
I knew Billy Charley
and his buddy Jim Bob Howard

29:32.145 --> 29:33.438
when I was younger, you know,

29:33.522 --> 29:37.609
whenever I run into them at the bar.
Pontotoc Pass, down there.

29:38.068 --> 29:40.779
They didn't have no money.
They was broke, so...

29:41.071 --> 29:43.573
I pulled my wallet out
and gave them both a 20-dollar bill.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.910
I said, "All right, y'all go and have fun.
I'll see y'all after a while," you know.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.663
That's about all I said. They went on in,

29:49.746 --> 29:52.040
and then I guess it was
around closing time...

29:52.124 --> 29:54.084
Twelve, one o'clock, something like that.

29:54.167 --> 29:58.088
Anyway, the younger guy, the skinny guy,
anyway, Jim Bob Howard,

29:58.422 --> 30:00.424
come up to my table
and said he was having trouble

30:00.507 --> 30:02.884
with Billy Charley in the parking lot.
Wouldn't let him get in his car.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.138
I jumped up
and followed him out the back door.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.598
I opened the door with my hand like that.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.727
They knocked me out.
I was unconscious till three days later.

30:11.810 --> 30:12.978
Woke up in the hospital.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.855
Kim Byars:
When they arrested Billy Charley,

30:14.938 --> 30:17.024
he kicked the windows out of the cop car

30:17.107 --> 30:21.278
and then, later, I had to go
to court later to testify about it.

30:21.361 --> 30:24.323
He laid in the hospital for a while.

30:24.406 --> 30:26.658
His brain was swollen.
They was gonna lifeline him,

30:26.742 --> 30:29.870
but finally the swelling went down
and they didn't have to.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.206
But, yeah,
Billy Charley was a pretty scary guy.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.294
Jim Bob was skinny,

30:37.377 --> 30:39.504
but his hair didn't look like that,
I don't think.

30:39.588 --> 30:41.423
That's Jim Bob.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.383
You think so?

30:49.139 --> 30:50.807
And that's Billy Charley.

30:51.141 --> 30:51.975
You think it is?

30:52.059 --> 30:52.893
Yep.

30:54.436 --> 30:57.314
The chunky face
and the hair for Billy Charley.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.816
Yeah, this whole area looks just like him.

30:59.900 --> 31:03.236
This skinny face looks...

31:04.237 --> 31:07.324
His hair was like that
whenever you come back.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.701
-Oh, Howard?
<i>-</i>Yes.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.162
Jim Bob Howard.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.334
<i>You know, I knew</i>

31:17.417 --> 31:20.921
<i>that they had mentioned Billy Charley</i>
<i>being a suspect.</i>

31:21.088 --> 31:25.175
<i>People calling in and saying</i>
<i>"Billy Charley" and stuff like that, but</i>

31:25.592 --> 31:28.178
<i>there was a conversation</i>
<i>that Billy told me,</i>

31:28.261 --> 31:32.224
<i>after I had seen him at McAlester</i>

31:32.849 --> 31:36.686
<i>where he told me</i>
<i>that they had went down to the police</i>

31:37.145 --> 31:40.273
<i>whenever they had asked him</i>
<i>to come in for questioning</i>

31:40.649 --> 31:46.321
<i>and that he had told them that he had been</i>
<i>at home with his family all day.</i>

31:47.948 --> 31:51.326
<i>I remember him telling me</i>
<i>that he had made a mistake.</i>

31:51.410 --> 31:54.704
<i>He said that,</i>
<i>at the time of the disappearance,</i>

31:55.038 --> 31:58.083
<i>that he was at Broadway Bar, drinking.</i>

35:38.219 --> 35:41.514
<i>I figure Johnny can be a big help</i>
<i>to y'all, you know,</i>

35:42.140 --> 35:46.144
<i>because he knows how them people are</i>
<i>down in that town too, at that time.</i>

35:46.227 --> 35:49.105
<i>Might give you some information</i>
<i>that might be helpful.</i>

37:36.087 --> 37:37.338
Jim Bob Howard: How you doing?

37:43.428 --> 37:44.637
Jim Bob Howard: Yeah, I know.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.557
Jim Bob Howard: No.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.351
Jim Bob Howard: I got messed up
with them lawyers and this shit

37:50.435 --> 37:53.521
and I don't want to mess with no people
at all, know what I mean?

37:53.646 --> 37:55.815
I don't know nothing about nothing,
know what I mean?

39:43.798 --> 39:44.674
<i>Hello.</i>

39:48.011 --> 39:48.887
<i>Hello.</i>

39:51.222 --> 39:52.348
<i>Yeah, barely.</i>

40:00.732 --> 40:02.775
<i>You think you gonna clear myself</i>
<i>right now?</i>

40:02.859 --> 40:06.029
<i>My name is clear.</i>
<i>I ain't the goddamn one in prison.</i>

40:07.572 --> 40:09.574
<i>Okay, I'm sorry. I get pissed, you know?</i>

40:17.081 --> 40:19.000
<i>Well, I don't know what they got on him.</i>

40:19.083 --> 40:20.752
<i>I didn't even know Tommy.</i>

40:20.835 --> 40:22.128
<i>Yeah, shit, I was trying to--</i>

40:22.211 --> 40:24.088
<i>Hell, it don't make no sense,</i>
<i>know what I'm saying?</i>

40:24.881 --> 40:28.635
<i>I wouldn't even help much.</i>
<i>If he done it, he done it, you get me?</i>

40:28.718 --> 40:31.846
<i>Damn, I'm sorry his fucking ass be</i>
<i>in there for a while.</i>

40:31.930 --> 40:33.598
<i>I know I got that truth.</i>

40:35.099 --> 40:38.227
<i>Yeah, I don't have any goddamn thing</i>
<i>associated with it.</i>

40:44.567 --> 40:47.111
<i>Did they ask me that? I...</i>

40:47.195 --> 40:48.613
<i>I think they might have, yeah.</i>

40:48.696 --> 40:50.782
<i>I had a gray pickup truck, yeah.</i>

41:07.298 --> 41:08.549
<i>All right, bro, you too.</i>

41:57.432 --> 41:59.100
<i>I got your letter.</i>

41:59.308 --> 42:02.353
<i>You were telling me that you heard</i>
<i>from Dan Clark,</i>

42:02.437 --> 42:05.189
<i>who was the guy that come</i>
<i>and see me here four or five years ago.</i>

42:12.780 --> 42:15.366
<i>First thing he asked me,</i>
<i>when he first got here, was he said,</i>

42:15.450 --> 42:16.784
<i>"Did you kill that girl?" I said, "No!</i>

42:16.868 --> 42:19.829
<i>If I had anything to do with anything</i>
<i>like that, I'd tell the police."</i>

42:19.912 --> 42:22.040
<i>You know me, because, you know...</i>

42:22.123 --> 42:24.500
<i>I really ain't got nothing to lose.</i>

42:24.584 --> 42:26.794
<i>And, you know, what makes you guys think</i>

42:26.878 --> 42:29.297
<i>that those two guys</i>
<i>out there didn't do that?</i>

42:44.937 --> 42:49.650
<i>Right. Well, all I can say is, you know,</i>

42:49.734 --> 42:53.446
<i>if you are right</i>
<i>and it wasn't these guys, then...</i>

42:53.946 --> 42:55.239
<i>God bless you for helping them</i>

42:55.323 --> 42:57.867
<i>and getting them out</i>
<i>and doing the right thing, but...</i>

42:57.950 --> 42:58.910
<i>You know...</i>

43:00.036 --> 43:03.247
<i>if you get them out</i>
<i>and something else happens later on,</i>

43:03.331 --> 43:05.374
<i>then what's gonna happen?</i>
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

43:05.458 --> 43:10.088
<i>Just be for sure that you know for sure</i>
<i>that they didn't do it.</i>
