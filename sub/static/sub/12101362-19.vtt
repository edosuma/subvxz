WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.546
Previously on Dynasty...
Leo's death was our fault.

00:04.587 --> 00:06.381
We didn't kill him.
That was Adam's doing.

00:06.423 --> 00:09.259
You are still married
to Brady Lloyd.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.261
And I am running to be
the next U.S. senator

00:11.302 --> 00:13.179
from the great state of Georgia.

00:13.221 --> 00:15.640
Amanda is not your cousin.
She is your sister.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.600
You're my biological father?

00:17.642 --> 00:18.810
It's true.
ADAM:
Are you sure you want

00:18.852 --> 00:20.145
to claim Amanda as yours?

00:20.186 --> 00:21.604
She's bad news.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.189
It's my duty to get her away
from Alexis.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.150
I was thinking
we could start over,

00:25.191 --> 00:27.610
try this whole sister thing
for real.

00:27.652 --> 00:28.778
I'm open to that.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.030
There is always
something

00:30.071 --> 00:31.614
that is more urgent than me.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.992
Show me how things will be
different in the future.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.785
I will.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.747
FALLON:
Well, tell Chet

00:38.788 --> 00:40.498
that our fall program deadline
is Friday--

00:40.540 --> 00:42.250
so either
he meets with me today,

00:42.292 --> 00:44.002
or he is fired tomorrow.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.047
Yes, Eva,
actually tell him that.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.677
You just keep repeating
the same pattern.

00:52.719 --> 00:55.221
I am just asking you
to be patient.

00:55.263 --> 00:57.640
I think I'll go be patient
in the guest room tonight.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.393
What?

01:00.435 --> 01:03.480
No. I just remembered that
I have a breakfast meeting.

01:03.521 --> 01:07.484
So push my first two calls,
and I'll be in as soon as I can.

01:07.525 --> 01:09.986
MICHAEL:
The VIP sectionals go

01:10.028 --> 01:11.988
in the following Monday,
which means we'll finish

01:12.030 --> 01:13.698
ahead of our target date.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.658
Well, our revised
target date.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.453
Good. Because my mental gas tank
is on empty.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.706
I barely have the energy
to hit the spa with Cristal.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.291
But we both need

01:23.333 --> 01:25.502
a recharge
after the whole Beto disaster,

01:25.543 --> 01:27.212
so I guess I'll power through.

01:27.253 --> 01:28.546
Wow, that's big of you.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.548
Enjoy the spa day,
you two.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.550
Hello, hello.
So, are you ready?

01:32.592 --> 01:34.552
I booked us for
hot stone massages,

01:34.594 --> 01:38.306
and then caviar
facial exfoliation.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.226
I might need something stronger
than a face full of fish eggs.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.061
Oh, no. What did Beto do now?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.563
Maybe I can ask for some shots
of tequila on the side.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.148
It's not a Beto problem.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.025
A reporter friend
just called to warn me

01:49.067 --> 01:51.444
about an article
the AJC's working on

01:51.486 --> 01:54.614
connecting Adam to the death
of an organized crime boss.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.950
Uh, well, that's...

01:56.991 --> 01:58.284
Ridiculous, right?

01:58.326 --> 01:59.994
The press is clearly
making up stories

02:00.036 --> 02:01.913
to hurt Blake's campaign.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.541
I hate to say this, but we're
gonna have to postpone spa day.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.334
Call an emergency
family meeting.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.294
And I'll bring
the tequila.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.713
We're gonna need it.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.756
(whispers):
Go. Go.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.882
Hi.

02:15.343 --> 02:16.678
Hey.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.221
Why aren't you
at the office?

02:18.263 --> 02:20.265
I thought today was
the big, uh,

02:20.306 --> 02:22.725
FSN program planning
marathon.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.227
Well, it is, but...

02:24.269 --> 02:26.187
I wanted to see you first.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.525
I, uh, saved you
the last blueberry scone.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.485
I had to fight off
some hungry people,

02:32.527 --> 02:35.488
but I don't back down when it
comes to my husband's happiness.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.532
Pastry wasn't really
what I had in mind

02:37.574 --> 02:39.909
when I said I need more
than apologies from you.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.412
I know that. And
I am trying, Liam.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.998
I am really sorry, and I
don't want to fight anymore.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.458
I mean, three nights
in different beds
is three too many.

02:47.500 --> 02:49.043
Well, look,
I don't like this, either.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.046
But a scone
doesn't help me understand

02:52.088 --> 02:54.048
how you're gonna stop
prioritizing your career

02:54.090 --> 02:55.341
over our marriage.

02:55.383 --> 02:56.467
Well, what about an omelet?

02:56.509 --> 02:58.011
Okay.
Look, I'm kidding.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.013
And I am working on it, okay?
I promise.

03:00.054 --> 03:01.806
I mean, I pushed
my morning meetings

03:01.848 --> 03:03.558
to have breakfast with you,
didn't I?

03:03.600 --> 03:04.851
When you put

03:04.893 --> 03:07.604
real thought
into long-term change...

03:08.771 --> 03:09.939
...you know where to find me.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.862
AMANDA:
You know, Alexis
probably won't be thrilled

03:15.904 --> 03:17.530
that I let you up here.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.032
Well, Alexis isn't thrilled
with a lot of things,

03:19.073 --> 03:20.533
and I'm allowed to see
my daughter.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.036
So this is just
a social call?
Yes and no.

03:23.077 --> 03:26.206
Now that you're a Carrington
and you're staying in Atlanta,

03:26.247 --> 03:29.375
I would like you to take a job
as my legal advisor at PPA.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.336
Primetime Private Air.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.587
(chuckles):
Seriously?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.380
Just smells a little bit
like nepotism.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.382
Well, then you have
an excellent nose.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.052
It's my company--
I'm in charge of personnel.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.511
But you do realize I have

03:40.553 --> 03:42.180
no legal background
in aviation, right?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.015
Yeah, well, I'm confident
that your skills will translate.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.767
Besides, what's more important
is that I fill the position

03:45.808 --> 03:48.394
with someone I can trust--
and who can I trust more

03:48.436 --> 03:49.896
than my own
flesh and blood?
Well...

03:49.938 --> 03:51.564
ALEXIS:
It's time for our shop o'...

03:51.606 --> 03:53.608
Lord, it is too early for this.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.568
Well, good morning
to you, too.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.570
I hate to cut this
unwanted visit short,

03:57.612 --> 03:59.614
but Amanda and I
need to get going

03:59.656 --> 04:02.242
before CristÃ³bal opens
the boutique to riffraff.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.994
New Birkens always
sell out before lunch.

04:05.036 --> 04:07.580
Well, enjoy the riffraff,
but Amanda's new job at PPA

04:07.622 --> 04:09.749
starts today.
It does?

04:09.791 --> 04:12.377
It's the best way for you
to restart your life,

04:12.418 --> 04:14.921
your career,
and join the family dynasty.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.674
We'll call it a
two-week trial period.

04:17.715 --> 04:18.716
You in?

04:18.758 --> 04:20.760
Sure.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.428
Let's do it.
I'll go get dressed.

04:26.724 --> 04:29.102
Your generosity is
as fake as your tan.

04:29.143 --> 04:30.770
We both know you're
using this job

04:30.812 --> 04:32.939
to pull Amanda away from me.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.984
Well, you know, helping Amanda
and keeping her away from you

04:36.025 --> 04:38.027
are one and the same.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.612
She can either follow
my professional success,

04:39.654 --> 04:41.614
or she can go down
in your sinking ship

04:41.656 --> 04:43.408
of shopping and sadness.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.034
It seems like a
simple choice to me.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.661
I am not worried.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.579
Clearly, you don't know her,

04:48.621 --> 04:50.665
but now that she'll be working
with you every day,

04:50.707 --> 04:52.917
she'll get to know you

04:52.959 --> 04:55.044
and see who you really are.

04:55.086 --> 04:58.172
I'll be shocked if she's
still speaking to you in a week.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.051
(phone vibrates)

05:04.345 --> 05:06.389
SAM:
All we tried to do was give him

05:06.431 --> 05:09.225
a little electrocution
so we could go into his
suite for a few days

05:09.267 --> 05:10.852
and wire it for surveillance.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.021
Did you just say "a
little electrocution"?

05:13.062 --> 05:15.231
Do you have any idea
how insane that sounds?

05:15.273 --> 05:17.233
Now that I hear it out loud,
kind of.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.736
Look, although we did send him
to the hospital,

05:19.777 --> 05:21.237
we didn't know Adam

05:21.279 --> 05:22.447
was gonna
let him die.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.656
I didn't let anyone die.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.241
Leo's heart gave out,

05:25.283 --> 05:26.951
and since I'm the only witness,
that's the only story.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.494
JENNINGS:
Actually, my friend says

05:28.536 --> 05:30.705
they have a nurse
on record who says otherwise.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.789
Okay, well, she's lying.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.416
She has no evidence.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.460
She may have suspicions,
but I made sure

05:35.501 --> 05:38.338
there'd be no chance of blowback
on anyone legally.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.006
I don't give a crap about legal.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.675
This story ties the Carrington
name to organized crime.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.927
No one's gonna read
past the headline.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.971
So we handle this ourselves.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.349
No outside help means no leads.

05:49.390 --> 05:50.850
Okay, so what do we do?

05:50.892 --> 05:52.685
We get ahead
of it. Adam,

05:52.727 --> 05:54.479
tie up any loose ends
at the hospital.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.022
Spin it into a
sympathetic story.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.774
We have friendly press
on the payroll, right?

05:57.815 --> 05:59.525
Maybe we can run
a counter-story.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.152
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.904
I didn't come here
to throw anyone under the bus.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.907
I started this,
and I have a plan to finish it.

06:05.948 --> 06:08.326
I just need
the reporter's number.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.079
I can get that for you, but
they go to press in 24 hours.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.373
That's more than enough time for
me to get him to drop the story.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.168
Please? Let me make this right.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.503
Okay.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.463
But you better do just that.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.801
Sales of my designs
on Fallon's shopping network

06:24.842 --> 06:26.594
have been amazing,

06:26.636 --> 06:30.056
so we have expanded
our production team

06:30.098 --> 06:33.059
and doubled our output.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.852
(chuckles)

06:34.894 --> 06:37.397
As an investor,
I'm impressed.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.524
As your son, I'm proud.

06:39.565 --> 06:42.443
You've really made
this dream come true.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.737
I'm not the only one
making dreams come true,

06:44.779 --> 06:46.697
Mr. Colby Co. Space.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.741
We'll see how that
shakes out, okay?

06:48.783 --> 06:50.576
But I appreciate you
brokering the deal with Blake

06:50.618 --> 06:52.286
for the future.

06:52.328 --> 06:56.082
If my son wants to go to space,
I will get him to space.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.750
MAN:
Excuse me.

07:00.878 --> 07:02.380
And you are?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.424
Hello, Dominique.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.844
Jeff, this is, uh...

07:07.885 --> 07:09.929
Brady.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.641
My ex-husband.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.399
âª âª

07:43.504 --> 07:46.174
He was my manager when
I started singing in New York.

07:46.215 --> 07:48.801
Then we fell in love
and got married.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.220
And this is something
you never thought to tell us?

07:51.262 --> 07:53.222
We were only married for a year.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.974
I had just divorced your father,

07:55.016 --> 07:58.186
and I was afraid
how you and Monica would react.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.272
Plus, we weren't
on the best terms.

08:02.231 --> 08:05.109
I have no idea
what he's doing here now.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.403
Oh, I have
a pretty good idea.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.573
You're in the public eye now,
and a new tax bracket.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.118
Which means there's a target on
your back and your bank account.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.411
This guy's return

08:15.453 --> 08:17.497
is too coincidental
to be coincidental.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.332
I agree. It is sketchy.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.792
Before I write him off,
I want to talk to him.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.378
Oh, I will.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.506
I can take care of myself.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.549
But it's sweet you care.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.938
I'm sorry for showing up
out of the blue like this.

08:41.979 --> 08:44.273
It's been 14 years, Brady.
I know,

08:44.315 --> 08:46.817
and ambushing you here is not
the reunion I had in mind.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.278
I just, I didn't know how else
to get in touch with you.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.072
And I'm pretty sure you
changed your number.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.783
Look...

08:53.824 --> 08:55.785
I want to explain
everything,

08:55.826 --> 08:57.787
but I'd rather
not do it here.

08:57.828 --> 08:58.955
Explain?

08:58.996 --> 09:00.248
You walked out

09:00.289 --> 09:03.751
on our marriage
and you never came back.

09:03.793 --> 09:08.422
Dom, please, just give me
a chance to apologize.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.716
Like you said,
it's been 14 years.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.261
I need more than 14 minutes
to do it the right way.

09:13.302 --> 09:14.387
And then I'll leave.

09:14.428 --> 09:16.013
Just...

09:16.055 --> 09:17.348
just one meal.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.850
Lunch tomorrow is all I can do.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.812
Everything working
out on day one?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.397
You know,
I was a little bit worried

09:24.438 --> 09:25.815
that the industry legalese
might slow me down,

09:25.856 --> 09:27.525
but I've almost
finished archiving

09:27.567 --> 09:29.193
the previous quarter's
contracts.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.695
Archiving?

09:30.736 --> 09:33.030
They've got you doing busywork?
Well, I think

09:33.072 --> 09:34.699
the team just simply
didn't want to overwhelm me.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.200
And, well, I felt

09:36.242 --> 09:38.035
like it was a good way
to get my feet wet.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.912
Keeping you occupied leaves
the better deals for them.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.205
Well, that's not gonna happen.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.250
I want you...

09:44.292 --> 09:46.252
on the Wannamaker deal.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.464
Um, I'm not certain

09:50.506 --> 09:52.717
that tackling
the company's biggest open deal

09:52.758 --> 09:54.844
on my first day is a good idea.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.472
Or maybe it's a great idea.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.975
Now you're getting it.
Can I pull someone
to assist?

10:01.017 --> 10:02.852
The deadline is in six hours.

10:02.893 --> 10:05.354
You handle this on your own,
you'll earn everyone's respect.

10:05.396 --> 10:08.232
You want to learn to swim
like the Carringtons,

10:08.274 --> 10:11.110
you don't get your feet wet--
you jump in the deep end.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.863
Deep end it is.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.198
FALLON: Thanks for coming
all the way down here.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.367
I always have time
for my stepdaughter.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.287
And truthfully, I needed
a breather from the campaign.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.290
I'm betting candidate Blake is
a lot to deal with.
He is.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.542
But I can tell that the drama
makes him happy,

10:26.584 --> 10:29.545
so... it's nice,
because that makes us happy.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.923
I'm sorry.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.426
I noticed Liam is still sleeping
in the guest room.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.844
Yeah.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.846
That's actually
why I called you.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.474
He's really putting me
through the wringer.

10:41.515 --> 10:44.185
But I don't know how many
more times I can apologize.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.020
Has he told you what he wants?

10:46.062 --> 10:48.981
Yeah, he wants to know how
I plan to change my priorities.

10:49.023 --> 10:51.067
Which I don't have
an answer for.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.277
I mean, you told me that it
took Blake losing the company

10:53.319 --> 10:54.862
for you two
to fix things, right?

10:54.904 --> 10:57.156
I don't think your father and I
would be together

10:57.198 --> 10:58.991
without that experience.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.160
But, I mean, this is ridiculous.
It's 2021--

11:01.202 --> 11:03.871
women can and should
have it all.

11:03.913 --> 11:07.416
I refuse to accept that a woman
can't be a CEO and a wife.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.126
I agree.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.046
But to be clear, I wasn't
talking about you as a woman.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.674
I was talking about you
as a Carrington.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.343
You have an
inborn drive

11:17.385 --> 11:20.388
to succeed at all costs,
just like Blake.

11:20.429 --> 11:23.057
So this is Blake's fault,
as usual.

11:23.099 --> 11:25.101
And I can't change my DNA,

11:25.142 --> 11:26.936
can I?
It's a lot to process.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.771
Take some time to think.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.981
Open yourself up to...

11:31.023 --> 11:33.359
what you are willing to change.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.822
I set up a meeting tomorrow
with the reporter

11:37.863 --> 11:39.281
to get him
to drop the story.

11:39.323 --> 11:40.991
Why are you the one
dealing with this?

11:41.033 --> 11:42.535
Adam's the one who
did what he did.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.370
Because I brought in Leo,

11:44.412 --> 11:46.831
and now the entire
Carrington name is at risk.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.582
I can't let
Cristal down again

11:48.624 --> 11:50.209
after screwing up with Beto.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.044
This is my family.

11:52.086 --> 11:55.548
Okay. What can I do to help?

11:55.589 --> 11:57.299
Really? You'll help?

11:57.341 --> 11:59.051
I was just venting.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.553
I need Blake to
win this election

12:00.594 --> 12:02.471
so I can get my housing
project approved.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.764
And...

12:03.806 --> 12:05.391
we're partners.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.768
I'm not gonna
leave you hanging.
Thank you.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.646
So... what are we gonna
say to this reporter?

12:10.688 --> 12:12.440
We insist Leo

12:12.481 --> 12:15.317
had no involvement with
organized crime, and he just...

12:15.359 --> 12:16.861
had a heart attack.

12:16.902 --> 12:17.820
If there's nothing exciting
to write about,

12:17.862 --> 12:18.821
they won't write it.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.781
And if that doesn't work?

12:20.823 --> 12:23.117
(sighs)
Some positive thinking from you
would be great.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.787
We'll use the juicier-story-swap
maneuver.

12:26.829 --> 12:31.000
Listen, all they care about
are clicks and eyeballs.

12:31.041 --> 12:33.002
But keep it subtle.
We can't seem too thirsty,

12:33.043 --> 12:34.587
or he'll know something's up.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.921
We're just two employers

12:35.963 --> 12:37.840
who lost
their squeaky-clean contractor

12:37.882 --> 12:39.467
to a faulty pacemaker.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.888
ADAM:
Everything seems pretty quiet,

12:43.929 --> 12:48.058
and I don't think we'll have
any trouble with that nurse.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.102
Did you kill her?
No, I just
made it clear

12:50.144 --> 12:52.438
that making up stories
about your chief of staff

12:52.480 --> 12:53.939
is not a great career move.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.275
Smart, smart.
So what's next?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.694
Do you have FDA contacts?

12:58.736 --> 13:00.362
I'm looking
to fast-track

13:00.404 --> 13:02.573
production approval
on my anti-aging drug,

13:02.615 --> 13:04.575
just in case this story
doesn't go away

13:04.617 --> 13:06.118
as fast as we want it to.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.703
That's good thinking.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.163
Yeah, I'll call someone I know
in the morning.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.539
Great.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.957
You know,
it's a proud day for a father

13:11.999 --> 13:13.501
when his kids
are all making moves.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.879
Fallon and her network.
You and this new drug.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.130
Now Amanda with PPA.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.258
Amanda joined PPA?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.927
Ah. Wh-When?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.428
How's that going?
Today.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.180
She is sharp.
Though I'm not sure she has

13:26.222 --> 13:28.140
the killer instinct I need
in my number two.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.726
Not everyone's cut out to be
a Carrington with a capital "C."

13:30.768 --> 13:32.144
You gave her a shot.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.479
It's been one day.
I think she deserves

13:33.521 --> 13:34.647
a little bit more time.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.942
I've got her working
on these Wannamaker contracts.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.568
I-I don't know,

13:39.610 --> 13:41.654
your-your gut instinct
is usually pretty spot-on,

13:41.695 --> 13:44.031
and we barely know her,
let alone trust her.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.574
Well, I am getting to know her.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.326
I'm helping her restart
her career,

13:47.368 --> 13:49.411
just like I helped you
with your medical license.

13:49.453 --> 13:51.288
As things get better,

13:51.330 --> 13:53.207
I will convince her
to move in to the manor

13:53.249 --> 13:54.834
and away from Alexis.

13:54.875 --> 13:57.837
It's time that my family was
under one roof.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.471
FALLON: Om...
I hope you like your martinis
double and dirty.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.639
Sorry.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.057
I didn't mean
to interrupt

14:10.099 --> 14:11.976
whatever it is...
you're doing.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.561
I saw the staff
heading up with this,

14:13.602 --> 14:14.937
and I was hoping
you needed

14:14.979 --> 14:17.731
a drinking buddy
as much as I needed a drink.

14:17.773 --> 14:19.900
I don't need a buddy
as much as I need a refill.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.610
Oh, well, I need both.

14:21.652 --> 14:24.071
I had quite the first day
working with Blake.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.908
He's putting a lot of faith
in me, very quickly.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.743
Well, you might want
to tread carefully.

14:29.785 --> 14:32.705
Blake's faith in anything
isn't exactly long-term.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.373
Good to know.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.417
But I don't want to waste
any time talking about work.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.753
I have a strict "no work
outside of the office" policy,

14:39.795 --> 14:41.589
and I'm off the clock.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.923
Mmm.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.758
Wait, you can really
just do that?

14:44.800 --> 14:47.428
Just leave work at work? How?

14:47.469 --> 14:49.930
It's 9:00.
Unless you're shopping or...

14:49.972 --> 14:52.808
you know, reading trashy gossip,
your laptop should be closed.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.518
So interesting. I thought

14:54.560 --> 14:56.937
my insatiable need
for success was hereditary,

14:56.979 --> 14:58.981
but we have the same DNA,

14:59.023 --> 15:01.150
and you're normal... ish.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.569
Thank you. I think.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.113
If I could just retrain myself
to be more like you

15:06.155 --> 15:09.325
and turn my brain off, then
my problems would be solved.

15:09.366 --> 15:11.076
Okay, my brain still works
after 6:00.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.536
I just don't think about work.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.747
And I don't think
a personality overhaul

15:14.788 --> 15:16.206
is the best plan.

15:16.248 --> 15:17.750
Well, I've tried
everything else.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.835
I mean, I even tried mediation
to clear my mind.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.503
Thanks for nothing, Cristal.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.881
Well, she's not wrong
about clearing your mind.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.927
But you're obviously a disaster
at meditation, so maybe...

15:27.968 --> 15:30.304
you just need a little help.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.805
I don't know.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.224
I haven't had an edible
since Wharton.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.310
Will this turn me
into a version of myself

15:36.352 --> 15:38.395
that's not obsessed
with work or success?

15:38.437 --> 15:40.773
No, it's not a magic potion.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.400
But it will relax you...

15:43.442 --> 15:45.444
and hopefully turn down
your intensity

15:45.486 --> 15:46.695
for a little while.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.863
You think I'm intense?

15:49.990 --> 15:51.116
Mm.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.619
Okay, fine, fine, hand 'em over.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.582
I don't feel anything.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.625
I'm gonna take one more.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.336
Oh, you probably shouldn't.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.296
Just in case.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.137
(groans softly)

16:12.179 --> 16:14.139
Well, your weed
didn't even knock me out

16:14.181 --> 16:16.892
for a full night's sleep.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.519
Amanda?

16:20.854 --> 16:23.148
Hello?

16:23.190 --> 16:25.818
(soft chiming, whooshing)

16:27.820 --> 16:29.238
Anders?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.699
I'm dead?
The edibles killed me?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.867
Oh, my God, I knew
I shouldn't have trusted Amanda.

16:33.909 --> 16:36.161
Please don't tell me
I'm required to wear white
in Heaven,

16:36.203 --> 16:38.330
because it's
after Labor Day...
Okay, just take a deep breath.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.498
You're not dead.

16:39.540 --> 16:40.666
This isn't Heaven.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.001
This is your chance

16:42.042 --> 16:44.086
to see the world you wished for.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.131
An alternate universe
where you're not obsessed

16:47.172 --> 16:48.924
with success at all costs.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.551
Like It's a Wonderful Life.

16:50.592 --> 16:53.137
Except I'm a much younger,
sexier George Bailey,

16:53.178 --> 16:54.638
and you are
Clarence the angel,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.265
here to teach me
some life lesson.

16:56.306 --> 16:58.225
Never saw it.
And this isn't a movie,

16:58.267 --> 16:59.601
despite the movie screen.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.228
This is a window

17:01.270 --> 17:02.938
into a real parallel world.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.565
From a safe distance, of course.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.191
Of course.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.777
I can't cross paths with
the other version of myself.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.487
Otherwise, I'll rip a hole

17:10.529 --> 17:12.197
in the space-time
continuum.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.033
I'm seen Back to the Future,
so I know the rules.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.035
I'll keep my arms and legs
inside the DeLorean

17:16.076 --> 17:17.286
at all times.
(chuckles)

17:17.327 --> 17:18.620
(chuckles)

17:18.662 --> 17:21.123
Let's get started, shall we?

17:21.165 --> 17:23.792
(crackling static)

17:25.461 --> 17:27.171
âª âª

17:27.212 --> 17:29.089
Oh, take it.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.632
The last piece?

17:30.674 --> 17:32.760
Absolutely not.
It's yours.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.553
Here. Wait.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.013
Aw.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.389
Have you seen my wife today?

17:37.431 --> 17:38.849
No. Is something wrong?

17:38.891 --> 17:39.975
Here I am.
Oh.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.852
Wow. Mm.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.145
Well, if this
is wrong,

17:43.187 --> 17:44.813
I don't want to be right.
Oh, stop.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.148
But not really.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.816
With the C.A. Gala
tomorrow night,

17:47.858 --> 17:49.526
I am finally red-carpet ready.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.028
But I don't know

17:51.070 --> 17:53.363
if people will recognize
me from the last one.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.199
It's my favorite party
of the year,

17:55.240 --> 17:56.867
and those training sessions
of yours have really paid off.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.619
Look who's talking.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.079
All right, keep
your clothes on.
Children present.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.039
Oh, relax. How do you
think you got here

18:02.081 --> 18:03.290
in the first place?

18:03.332 --> 18:05.084
Something terrible
has happened.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.087
There's been an explosion at
the C.A. southern refinery site.

18:08.128 --> 18:10.214
No one was hurt, but I'm
wondering if we should just...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.924
postpone the gala.
We'll be fine,

18:11.965 --> 18:14.802
as long as we handle this
like we always do: together.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.554
Well, I am gonna
go grab my racket.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.555
I'll meet you at
the car in ten?

18:18.597 --> 18:19.681
Great.
Hey, Mom?

18:20.432 --> 18:21.642
Do you want to
get lunch after?

18:21.683 --> 18:23.811
No. My trainer's--
oh, here she is.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.730
Remember, I have
an afternoon

18:26.772 --> 18:28.315
full of glam
appointments,

18:28.357 --> 18:30.484
so I might need to wrap
a few minutes early.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.361
Well, then let's get started.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.655
(whooshing)

18:34.696 --> 18:37.032
FALLON: I've got
a couple questions here.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.450
My parents are
happily married,

18:38.492 --> 18:40.285
Adam and I like
each other,

18:40.327 --> 18:41.745
and Amanda lives here

18:41.787 --> 18:43.580
and works with Blake
at Carrington Atlantic?

18:43.622 --> 18:44.665
All true.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.583
And I play tennis regularly?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.418
It's your passion.
Which you're free to pursue,

18:48.460 --> 18:50.337
because you're no longer ruled

18:50.379 --> 18:51.839
by unchecked ambition.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.133
Mm. So my theory
that life would be better

18:54.174 --> 18:56.426
if I were wired differently
looks pretty good.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.387
As do I in that tennis outfit.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.972
Keep it rolling.

19:00.013 --> 19:02.224
Ugh, wait.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.726
Why are we watching Jeff?
Where's the tennis?

19:04.768 --> 19:05.978
Well, you've got to see
the whole picture.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.440
Hey. What's the latest?

19:10.482 --> 19:12.568
The explosion took out
5,000 barrels.

19:12.609 --> 19:14.444
BLAKE:
If we're perceived to be
at fault, it would devastate

19:14.486 --> 19:17.489
our bottom line, and our clients
could cancel their contracts.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.241
Losing future business
on top of these damages

19:19.283 --> 19:21.285
would finish us.
We need to clean up
the spill

19:21.326 --> 19:23.287
and make sure the public knows

19:23.328 --> 19:25.164
that this is not on us.
Don't worry,

19:25.205 --> 19:26.623
we're good.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.292
I'm confident I can use the same
strategy we used

19:28.333 --> 19:29.918
with the senator
a few years ago.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.004
And I'll head up a big PR push.
Stick to the plan...

19:32.045 --> 19:35.174
we'll survive this mess.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.968
It's all fine and dandy

19:38.010 --> 19:39.595
that everybody is
happier in this world,

19:39.636 --> 19:41.513
but the only reason
I want a change is Liam.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.598
Where is he?

19:42.639 --> 19:44.183
Patience.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.767
(crackling static)

19:46.727 --> 19:49.104
Was that our eighth straight win
against them?

19:49.146 --> 19:50.689
Uh, ninth, actually.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.691
Why do Evan and Trixie
keep wanting rematches?

19:52.733 --> 19:55.152
I mean, it's like they're
obsessed with us. (chuckles)

19:55.194 --> 19:56.778
This was really therapeutic.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.615
I lost a patient
at the clinic yesterday.

19:59.656 --> 20:00.991
It was pretty traumatic,
but, you know,

20:01.033 --> 20:03.118
backhands are
a good emotional outlet.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.995
How old?
Ten years old.

20:05.037 --> 20:05.996
Oh.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.539
Scottish terrier.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.208
No. Well, I have no doubt

20:09.249 --> 20:11.293
that 2016's best vet in Decatur

20:11.335 --> 20:13.754
will bounce back.
Thank you so much
for being supportive.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.672
Are you ready
for tomorrow night?

20:15.714 --> 20:18.258
Yes. I was able to push
the ambassador job in Paris,

20:18.300 --> 20:20.260
and now I can deejay
at the gala.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.762
What the hell?
(gasps)

20:21.803 --> 20:23.847
Oh.
Ooh.
(chuckles)

20:23.889 --> 20:25.682
Here, um,
I'll go get some towels.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.017
Here, uh,
p-please take that.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.435
Um, please...

20:28.477 --> 20:30.312
I think you need this
a little more than I do.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.897
(laughs)

20:33.482 --> 20:35.525
Can I help you
with anything else?

20:35.567 --> 20:37.402
Yeah, actually,
I was here to interview someone

20:37.444 --> 20:39.529
for a profile piece,
but they just cancelled.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.366
I couldn't help
but overhear something
about a ambassador by day,

20:42.407 --> 20:43.617
(laughs)
a deejay by night?

20:43.659 --> 20:45.077
If you're interested

20:45.118 --> 20:47.162
and available, I'd
love to interview you.

20:48.163 --> 20:49.957
Well, I am
definitely interested

20:49.998 --> 20:51.708
and absolutely available.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.043
Uh, Fallon Carrington.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.378
Of the Carringtons.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.339
I know who you are.
I'm Liam Ridley,

20:57.381 --> 20:59.007
of The New Yorker.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.467
FALLON:
Okay, if that Liam
and that Fallon

21:00.509 --> 21:01.927
can make a love connection,

21:01.969 --> 21:03.679
then this Fallon knows
what she has to do

21:03.720 --> 21:05.514
to save her marriage.

21:05.555 --> 21:06.765
And our time

21:06.807 --> 21:08.517
is up.
What?

21:08.558 --> 21:10.185
No.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.229
Did you not just hear me?
I need to see how this ends.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.189
There is no end. There just is.

21:14.231 --> 21:16.483
Okay, so then turn it back on.
I mean, who's gonna know?

21:16.525 --> 21:17.776
What's the big deal?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.278
This is as far
as the guide goes.

21:19.319 --> 21:20.946
We're now
in uncharted territory.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.032
With unknown consequences.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.617
Sounds like my life.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.494
Which is why I need to know
what happens here.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.414
So I can make an
informed decision.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.500
Lucky I'm a sucker for love.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.710
Yay.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.592
Do you know what
you're doing with that?
Haven't got a clue.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.136
(chuckles softly)
I have to admit,

21:44.177 --> 21:46.013
it is nice seeing you again.

21:46.054 --> 21:46.930
I wonder
sometimes...

21:46.972 --> 21:48.015
Whoa!

21:49.016 --> 21:51.268
Oh, come on.
These two again?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.644
Can't you change
the channel?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.980
I just electrocuted myself
turning this on,

21:55.022 --> 21:57.607
so no, I can't change
the channel.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.026
I'm fine, by the way.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.819
I'm sorry.
I thought you were already dead.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.404
Okay, fine, I'll just
sit here and watch

22:02.446 --> 22:03.864
how happy everybody is.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.866
My personality shift
seems to have had

22:05.907 --> 22:08.201
a very positive impact on
everyone's life, right?

22:08.243 --> 22:09.619
Yeah, we'll see.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.415
(crackling static)

22:13.457 --> 22:16.168
I am finished.
Well, a job well done

22:16.209 --> 22:17.794
by both of us.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.546
Not our first time saving
the company.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.716
Hmm.
Our frame-the-enemy
defense always works.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.844
As far as anyone knows,
the explosion originated

22:25.886 --> 22:28.638
from the McNaughton Conservation
Group's servers.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.599
An act of ecoterrorism.

22:31.808 --> 22:32.893
Our hands are clean.

22:34.311 --> 22:37.272
Look, I know we pulled
some ruthless moves here,

22:37.314 --> 22:40.567
but self-preservation is
the first law of business.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.903
Kill or be killed.
Do you have

22:42.944 --> 22:46.948
any regrets about staying
at C.A. all these years?

22:48.158 --> 22:50.410
Sometimes, sure.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.038
I was already interning
here in high school.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.790
And when Fallon
told me back then

22:54.831 --> 22:56.833
that she'd never
join the company,

22:56.875 --> 22:59.711
for a second I thought
I'd follow her lead

22:59.753 --> 23:02.130
and see what I could
do with my life.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.882
What happened?

23:03.924 --> 23:06.676
She couldn't stay focused on
anything for more than a day.

23:06.718 --> 23:10.472
She got us kicked out of
everything we tried: theater,

23:10.514 --> 23:12.474
yearbook, the a cappella club.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.602
It made me double down on tech
and the stability of C.A.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.729
Here I am, still.

23:19.147 --> 23:20.941
What about you?

23:20.982 --> 23:24.027
Well, I always wanted
to work with my dad.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.446
I mean, I picked C.A.
over everything--

23:26.488 --> 23:29.449
friends, birthdays,
vacations--

23:29.491 --> 23:31.827
all just to prove my worth.

23:33.370 --> 23:36.248
I'm not sure that's
even possible with him, so...

23:37.207 --> 23:40.502
Maybe there's a brighter future
for both of us out there.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.589
FALLON:
Okay,

23:44.631 --> 23:46.466
maybe not everyone's as
happy as they could be,

23:46.508 --> 23:48.510
but you can't
blame me for that.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.887
I think Jeff just did.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.683
More Blake and Alexis?

23:54.724 --> 23:56.268
I don't care
about this happy couple.

23:56.309 --> 23:58.311
I want to see my happy couple.

23:58.353 --> 24:01.231
Amanda and Jeff took care of it,
so we have even more time

24:01.273 --> 24:04.317
(laughs)
together in our...
cozy little spot.

24:04.359 --> 24:06.361
I'm so glad
to see you.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.946
Mm.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.197
Uh-oh.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.576
Cristal!

24:12.617 --> 24:13.994
Blake!

24:14.035 --> 24:15.704
I thought you
were tanning with Becky!

24:15.745 --> 24:17.706
I was, until I came home
after the second coat

24:17.747 --> 24:19.708
to help Fallon get ready
for her interview.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.001
How could you?

24:21.042 --> 24:22.377
With my friend/

24:22.419 --> 24:23.503
trainer?

24:23.545 --> 24:24.796
Oh, please.
You and I both know

24:24.838 --> 24:26.298
we're only together
for the kids.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.300
Who, by the way,
are no longer kids.

24:28.341 --> 24:29.593
It's time

24:29.634 --> 24:31.178
for this charade to end.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.054
I want to be
with the woman I love.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.640
We agreed to be together
until Fallon found her footing.

24:35.682 --> 24:37.184
Which she hasn't yet.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.977
She would spin out
if we divorced.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.437
You are fired...

24:40.479 --> 24:42.481
as my trainer
and my friend.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.525
And you can stay out here
since you love it so much.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.486
Uh, Alexis, wait...

24:47.527 --> 24:49.488
ANDERS:
Let's recap, shall we?

24:49.529 --> 24:51.198
Because of your lack
of ambition,

24:51.239 --> 24:53.074
Jeff got pushed
into Blake's claws,

24:53.116 --> 24:55.577
where he lost his empathy
and his zest for life.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.579
Blake groomed
a very unhappy Amanda

24:57.621 --> 25:00.415
to take over C.A.
because you weren't interested.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.585
And he and Alexis maintained
a horrible marriage for you.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.587
I mean, every universe has
its miseries.

25:05.629 --> 25:08.048
And if that's what it takes
to save my marriage, then...

25:08.089 --> 25:09.591
I'm okay with it.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.800
What's next?

25:10.842 --> 25:12.719
(chuckles)
What's next is me leaving.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.721
You're heading
into dangerous territory,

25:14.763 --> 25:16.389
so you're on your own.

25:16.431 --> 25:18.433
Fine, be that way.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.147
(crackling static)

25:24.189 --> 25:26.316
Well, Blake has to...
FALLON:
Oh!

25:26.358 --> 25:27.442
Anders! Anders!

25:27.484 --> 25:28.860
(gasps)
It's Liam!

25:28.902 --> 25:30.570
Anders?

25:30.612 --> 25:32.906
Where could you
possibly have to be?

25:32.948 --> 25:34.908
So, you also deejay
as a hobby?

25:34.950 --> 25:36.993
Yeah, but I'm hoping
to turn it into more.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.703
It was Blake's idea,
actually.

25:38.745 --> 25:41.081
We all have to help out
at the company gala every year,

25:41.122 --> 25:43.583
and since I have no interest
in oil or the foundation,

25:43.625 --> 25:46.044
I agreed to show up,
press play,

25:46.086 --> 25:48.088
and get people out
on the dance floor.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.714
Fallon Carrington,

25:49.756 --> 25:52.133
you do seem to have
a lot of layers.
(laughs)

25:52.175 --> 25:54.135
Can you tell me about
your ambassador position?

25:54.177 --> 25:57.347
Well, it's in France, and it's
more of a dream job, really.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.683
I mean, being an ambassador
for Spartan Shakes

25:59.724 --> 26:00.976
isn't for everyone,

26:01.017 --> 26:03.061
but it really suits me.
Oh, wow.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.729
You meant a brand ambassador.

26:04.771 --> 26:06.731
And it's not too much,
you know?

26:06.773 --> 26:08.191
The flexible schedule
allows me time

26:08.233 --> 26:10.193
for things like
breakfast with family

26:10.235 --> 26:12.404
and tennis with my brother...

26:12.445 --> 26:15.574
interviews with...
handsome reporters.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.953
I was wondering, if you wanted
to return the favor,

26:19.995 --> 26:23.832
would you maybe be interested in
being my plus-one to the gala?

26:25.542 --> 26:27.502
I appreciate the invite,

26:27.544 --> 26:29.504
uh, but the truth is...

26:29.546 --> 26:32.799
I see you, Fallon Carrington.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.137
I just don't think
it would work.

26:37.178 --> 26:40.015
We're not driving
in the same gear, so to speak.

26:40.056 --> 26:42.684
I'm in fifth, and, well,
I think you're more...

26:42.726 --> 26:44.144
coasting in neutral.

26:44.185 --> 26:46.521
But I'm flattered.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.148
Well, I guess we're done here.

26:48.189 --> 26:50.483
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

26:50.525 --> 26:51.776
Yeah.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.616
(door opens)

26:57.657 --> 26:58.617
Oh.

26:58.658 --> 26:59.743
Sorry. Wait.

26:59.784 --> 27:01.453
You're Amanda Carrington.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.081
Yeah, that's me.
Who might you be?

27:05.123 --> 27:07.083
I'm, uh, Liam Ridley.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.586
I'm a reporter
with The New Yorker.
FALLON: So Liam

27:09.628 --> 27:12.255
has zero interest in me,
but he's into my sister?

27:12.297 --> 27:14.382
This is what I stayed here for?

27:14.424 --> 27:15.759
(chuckles)

27:15.800 --> 27:17.552
How do I turn this thing off?

27:17.594 --> 27:19.554
(Liam and Amanda talking
indistinctly)

27:19.596 --> 27:22.140
(voices distorting)

27:23.099 --> 27:24.142
(Amanda laughing)

27:24.184 --> 27:26.645
Are you kidding me, Anders?

27:26.686 --> 27:28.480
Well, you were right--
this is not Heaven.

27:28.521 --> 27:30.065
This is Hell.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.691
I'm supposed to stand here
for the rest of eternity

27:31.733 --> 27:33.860
watching these two
frozen in love?

27:33.902 --> 27:37.822
(Amanda's laughter echoing)

27:41.993 --> 27:43.787
BLAKE:
Fallon! Amanda!

27:43.828 --> 27:45.997
Wake up!

27:48.291 --> 27:51.419
Look at this room.
It's disgusting.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.215
Somebody tell me what the hell's
going on in here? Now.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.265
BOTH (laughing):
Hello, Father.
Well, I'm glad

28:04.307 --> 28:07.519
the two of you are
so amused at whatever it is
that took place in here,

28:07.560 --> 28:08.895
but if you're done
drunkenly bonding,

28:08.937 --> 28:11.022
I need a moment
with Amanda.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.317
Yeah. I'd better
be going anyway.
(clears throat)

28:14.359 --> 28:18.238
Hey. I didn't realize how much
I needed a change of scenery

28:18.279 --> 28:20.240
and a clear head, so thank you.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.534
Oh. Also,

28:22.575 --> 28:25.620
make sure that you
are doing this job for you.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.747
Otherwise, you're
gonna wake up one day

28:27.789 --> 28:29.916
wondering what
you're still doing there.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.419
Boop!

28:34.629 --> 28:36.172
(clears throat)

28:36.214 --> 28:37.757
What, do you always party
on a school night?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.551
Oh, we were just
having a little fun.

28:39.592 --> 28:42.429
Don't worry, I don't
let my personal life
affect my work life.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.264
Well, something
has affected your work.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.266
A friend at Wannamaker
caught an error

28:46.307 --> 28:48.309
in the amortized
cost schedule

28:48.351 --> 28:50.186
that could have cost us
thousands.
No, that's impossible.

28:50.228 --> 28:51.813
I mean,
I may be new to aviation,

28:51.855 --> 28:53.022
but I don't make
filing mistakes.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.524
Well, the mistake was made,

28:54.566 --> 28:56.234
so I'm gonna need you
to revise the errors

28:56.276 --> 28:57.861
and resubmit
before the office opens.

28:57.902 --> 29:00.155
Now, no one needs to know
about it, and I'll just...

29:00.196 --> 29:02.824
forget that I saw
all of this.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.826
Sorry, to be clear,
I finished my work properly

29:04.868 --> 29:06.745
last night.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.872
And how I spend my time off is
actually none of your business.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.165
So...

29:10.206 --> 29:12.000
if that doesn't work
for you, then...

29:12.041 --> 29:13.960
maybe PPA doesn't work for me.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.378
Oh, don't be melodramatic.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.796
If you want to be

29:16.838 --> 29:18.465
part of the family
and restart your career,

29:18.506 --> 29:20.341
we both know that this is
the only way.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.386
Well, with all due respect, you
don't really know me well enough

29:23.428 --> 29:24.804
to make that call.

29:24.846 --> 29:26.556
So, while I appreciate
the opportunity

29:26.598 --> 29:28.308
to be a part of your empire...

29:28.349 --> 29:29.726
I quit.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.730
CHUCK:
Did you ever see anything odd?

29:33.772 --> 29:35.857
With Leo?

29:35.899 --> 29:38.985
The only odd thing was
how generous he could be.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.113
I mean, he even volunteered with
senior citizens every Tuesday.

29:42.155 --> 29:44.657
Yeah, and sometimes
it was Thursdays.
Uh-huh.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.494
But the guy was a great
partner and leader.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.662
He expected a lot...

29:50.622 --> 29:52.415
You're not writing
any of this down.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.667
Because nobody cares about
nice people or senior citizens.

29:54.709 --> 29:55.877
I thought
you had information

29:55.919 --> 29:57.545
about Leo's death
being suspicious,

29:57.587 --> 30:00.215
or at least what kind
of illegal business he was into.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.509
If he was into anything illegal,
we didn't see it.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.427
And as far as his death,

30:04.469 --> 30:06.763
you're fishing for a dog
that won't bark, Chuck.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.431
Tragedies happen

30:08.473 --> 30:10.391
in routine procedures
all the time.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.060
Maybe God needed a contractor.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.145
CHUCK:
This was a waste of time.

30:14.187 --> 30:16.189
But at least I already have
what I need, anyway.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.024
A healthy
organized crime figure

30:18.066 --> 30:20.151
goes into the hospital
and mysteriously dies

30:20.193 --> 30:22.278
underneath the eye
of a Carrington heir.

30:22.320 --> 30:23.947
Meanwhile,
Blake Carrington,

30:23.988 --> 30:25.532
a former murder suspect,

30:25.573 --> 30:27.492
wants the people to elect him
into the Senate.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.618
(chuckles)

30:28.660 --> 30:30.328
It writes itself.

30:30.370 --> 30:31.788
Aside from Blake being arrested,

30:31.830 --> 30:33.373
none of those other things
have been proven.

30:33.414 --> 30:34.582
Not yet.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.417
Do you want a juicier story?

30:36.459 --> 30:37.752
Because I have

30:37.794 --> 30:39.671
an A-lister staying
in the penthouse,

30:39.712 --> 30:42.590
and I can get you some dirt.

30:42.632 --> 30:43.800
Pass.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.468
But thanks for the drink.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.053
Uh, look.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.055
Leo's death
was traumatic for us,

30:49.097 --> 30:51.015
and we just want
to be done with it.

30:51.057 --> 30:52.725
So...

30:52.767 --> 30:54.352
what'll it take for you
to drop the story?
Look,

30:54.394 --> 30:56.271
I already have your number.

30:56.312 --> 30:59.899
Let me think of mine,
and I'll get back to you.

31:04.737 --> 31:06.489
I borrowed
from the wrong people.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.324
And when I couldn't
pay them back,

31:08.366 --> 31:09.993
they threatened me.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.995
And then they
threatened you.

31:13.454 --> 31:16.040
I left to protect you.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.792
And the less you
knew, the better.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.461
Well, I knew nothing.
So job well done.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.297
Look...

31:22.338 --> 31:25.592
I know it's hard to
believe anything I say,

31:25.633 --> 31:29.429
but I am sorry for
abandoning you, Dominique.

31:29.470 --> 31:32.640
You left me in the dark, Brady.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.475
No money, no family,

31:34.517 --> 31:36.311
and a failing career.

31:37.270 --> 31:40.064
After I waited a year...

31:40.106 --> 31:43.526
I had to convince myself
that you were dead.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.988
The other option was
too painful.

31:47.030 --> 31:50.241
I never stopped
thinking about you.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.493
Or believing in you.

31:59.834 --> 32:02.629
You know, I've thought
about this day for a long time.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.883
And not to get
greedy, but...

32:08.509 --> 32:10.428
...I'm not ready for it to end.

32:15.850 --> 32:17.644
Amanda wouldn't let you
push her around,

32:17.685 --> 32:19.479
so now you're using
your little stick

32:19.520 --> 32:21.856
to poke something
that won't fight back?

32:21.898 --> 32:24.692
Get out of my office
before I throw you out.
Don't worry,

32:24.734 --> 32:27.153
I'm just here retrieving
a few things Amanda left behind

32:27.195 --> 32:28.947
in her rush to get away
from you.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.782
Sounds like you did a great job

32:30.823 --> 32:32.909
with her.
I was just trying to help.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.702
You know,
real parenting involves

32:34.744 --> 32:37.205
more than shopping
and lunching.
(laughs)

32:37.246 --> 32:39.499
Judge all you want,
but I predicted this.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.084
Not because I know the future,

32:41.125 --> 32:43.628
but because
I actually know Amanda.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.422
Real parenting...

32:46.464 --> 32:49.342
involves more
than just business.

32:49.384 --> 32:52.095
Not that you
would ever understand that.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.517
(birds squawking)

33:00.228 --> 33:02.897
Liam?

33:02.939 --> 33:04.607
I'm so glad
you showed up.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.567
Well, I told you
to let me know

33:06.609 --> 33:08.277
when you're ready
to talk, so...

33:08.319 --> 33:10.279
here I am.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.865
I've been retracing my mistakes
since our fight,

33:12.907 --> 33:15.618
and you were right to ask
for more than an apology.

33:15.660 --> 33:18.204
It's important to me
that you took this seriously.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.831
And I have.

33:19.872 --> 33:23.001
I mean, you said it:
I am obsessed with success.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.211
(chuckles)
But I was thinking,

33:25.253 --> 33:27.839
if I could unlearn
my obsessive drive,

33:27.880 --> 33:30.425
then I might be able
to balance it all.

33:30.466 --> 33:33.886
You know, my family,
my marriage and my career.

33:33.928 --> 33:35.888
But now I know

33:35.930 --> 33:39.058
that giving up who I am
is not the way to do it.

33:39.100 --> 33:42.603
I-I never said I wanted you
to change who you are.

33:42.645 --> 33:44.856
Fallon, I love your fire.

33:44.897 --> 33:46.858
I know, but...

33:46.899 --> 33:48.443
I mean,
where does that leave us?

33:48.484 --> 33:50.611
Something has to change.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.489
(sighs)
Otherwise, we're just back
to where we started, aren't we?

33:53.531 --> 33:56.075
But I didn't come here
empty-handed.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.787
I'm not willing to give up
my company.

33:59.829 --> 34:04.208
But I am willing to walk away
for a little while

34:04.250 --> 34:06.669
and give us a chance
to rebuild.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.800
(sighs)

34:12.842 --> 34:14.969
I came by your
office yesterday,

34:15.011 --> 34:17.305
and I saw you working.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.098
(chuckles)

34:19.140 --> 34:21.809
Fallon, you were
just glowing.

34:23.394 --> 34:25.688
It made me think, how could
I put you in this position?

34:25.730 --> 34:28.024
That's okay--
marriage is about compromise.

34:28.066 --> 34:30.735
But walking away from the
thing that you love isn't
much of a compromise.

34:32.779 --> 34:36.949
And now hearing
what I put you through...

34:36.991 --> 34:39.619
it's clear I'm not the husband
I want to be.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.621
What are you talking about?
You're a great husband.

34:41.662 --> 34:43.706
Oh, Fallon, you're
not getting it.

34:44.707 --> 34:46.876
It's not about you anymore.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.961
And leaving your
company for a week,

34:49.003 --> 34:50.797
a month or even a year.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.552
I think I need some time to
figure out who I am again.

34:58.679 --> 35:01.516
More than just a few
nights in a guest room.

35:07.313 --> 35:09.524
I think we need
to take a break, Fallon.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.111
No. There has to be another way.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.823
I'm sorry.

35:16.864 --> 35:19.826
I don't think there is.

35:21.661 --> 35:23.746
âª âª

35:37.301 --> 35:39.303
I didn't realize how much
I needed to hear an apology.

35:39.345 --> 35:40.847
Even after all these years.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.849
And as promised...

35:42.890 --> 35:44.976
it's time for me
to hit the road,

35:45.017 --> 35:47.728
let you get back to all
the wonderful things you
have going for you.

35:47.770 --> 35:51.524
Did you really come back
just to apologize, or...

35:51.566 --> 35:53.609
were there other reasons?

35:53.651 --> 35:56.737
I came here to tell you
that I never stopped loving you.

35:58.197 --> 36:00.158
But when I saw you yesterday...

36:00.199 --> 36:02.034
so happy
in the life you've built,

36:02.076 --> 36:04.704
I couldn't derail
your momentum.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.127
But I want to give
you this before I go.

36:13.212 --> 36:16.799
It's the set list from the first
club show we booked together.

36:18.050 --> 36:19.927
You saved it?

36:19.969 --> 36:22.388
It's the one piece of you
I always kept with me.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.307
But now that I
see you're okay,

36:24.348 --> 36:26.767
and you've moved on,

36:26.809 --> 36:31.189
it's time I return it, so
that I can move on, too.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.484
Goodbye, Dom.

36:36.736 --> 36:38.362
Brady, wait.

36:40.489 --> 36:43.576
This is probably
a big mistake, but...

36:45.369 --> 36:48.748
I'm not ready
for you to go... yet.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.005
Thank you for coming.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.256
Whiskey?

36:57.298 --> 36:58.424
Gin.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.551
On the rocks,
with lime.

37:00.593 --> 37:02.970
I thought school night
socializing was a no-go.

37:03.012 --> 37:04.889
That's why I
asked you here.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.433
You were right-- you know, what
you do on your personal time,

37:07.475 --> 37:09.227
it's none of my business.

37:09.268 --> 37:11.437
Well, it's nice to know
you're finally listening to me.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.857
I...

37:14.899 --> 37:16.275
ignored your reluctance,

37:16.317 --> 37:18.569
and I never asked you
what you wanted.

37:18.611 --> 37:20.446
I was trying to help...

37:20.488 --> 37:21.656
But...?

37:21.697 --> 37:23.324
It was more about trying

37:23.366 --> 37:25.368
to build a relationship
with you.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.955
Business is the only
language I know,

37:28.996 --> 37:31.123
and I thought that PPA
was my best shot.

37:31.165 --> 37:33.459
Why couldn't you
just admit that?
I don't know,

37:33.501 --> 37:35.253
I don't think I realized it
until you quit.

37:36.545 --> 37:39.423
You and Alexis have a lot
in common...

37:39.465 --> 37:42.009
and have been
getting close quickly,

37:42.051 --> 37:43.511
so I... I
just thought

37:43.552 --> 37:45.554
I was gonna lose you
before I got to know you.

37:46.514 --> 37:49.183
I get it.
But I'm not going anywhere,

37:49.225 --> 37:51.227
and we do not need business
to bond.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.020
I agree, which is why...

37:53.062 --> 37:55.064
Come on.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.028
(chuckles):
No pressure, just...

38:01.070 --> 38:02.655
nails and chat.

38:02.697 --> 38:04.365
You really didn't have
to do all of this for me.

38:04.407 --> 38:06.200
It was my regular
appointment time.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.202
I just had her bring
a friend.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.162
You know, despite
first impressions,

38:10.204 --> 38:12.581
I do really love working, um,
specifically in medical law,

38:12.623 --> 38:14.750
so I was just wondering
if you could maybe put in

38:14.792 --> 38:16.419
a good word for me
at the hospital?

38:16.460 --> 38:19.213
You know there are a few wings
with our name on it there?

38:19.255 --> 38:20.840
Consider it done.

38:23.009 --> 38:24.302
(exhales)

38:27.722 --> 38:28.973
Chuck turned down
the bribe.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.349
Said he's going
with a different story,

38:30.391 --> 38:31.517
so I guess
you talked to him.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.811
No. He didn't call me.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.063
What other story
is he talking about?

38:36.105 --> 38:39.191
I don't know, but he said
it'd be up on the site.

38:43.195 --> 38:44.488
Oh, no.

38:44.530 --> 38:46.824
This is a hit piece
on the hotel.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.452
Mafia ties, cult leaders,
poison cocktails,

38:49.493 --> 38:51.537
electrocution and brawls.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.414
Is La Mirage the most dangerous
place in Atlanta?

38:53.456 --> 38:55.333
He did go
with a juicier story.

38:55.374 --> 38:57.835
This is a disaster.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.713
"An open socket
next to the stage

39:00.755 --> 39:03.257
sent their contractor
to the hospital."

39:04.342 --> 39:06.093
Wait a minute.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.803
Blake, Cristal and Adam

39:07.845 --> 39:09.972
were the only ones
who knew that information.

39:10.014 --> 39:11.640
My God.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.268
I was trying to protect them,
and they just...

39:14.310 --> 39:16.854
they just betrayed me.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.067
(exhales)

39:22.026 --> 39:23.652
AMANDA:
Woops.

39:23.694 --> 39:25.696
You're not the only Carrington
kid who can make a mess.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.490
Oh. Hello.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.201
I know you sabotaged
the PPA filing.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.870
(chuckles)
After some minor
digging and some...

39:32.912 --> 39:35.122
well, less minor threats,

39:35.164 --> 39:38.042
a scared little assistant
admitted that a Mr. Carrington

39:38.084 --> 39:39.919
had called to
make some edits.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.253
Any idiot can
do the math.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.839
Oh. Actually,
maybe you can't.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.883
You may have
other people fooled, but...

39:45.925 --> 39:47.551
I know your game,

39:47.593 --> 39:50.054
and I refuse to let
lying sisters lie.

39:50.096 --> 39:52.556
That's why I pushed you
out of PPA in one day.

39:52.598 --> 39:53.724
(chuckles)

39:53.766 --> 39:55.393
Oh, you didn't push me anywhere.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.103
I never wanted to work at PPA.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.897
Actually, thanks to you,
I managed to exit gracefully.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.775
And I've landed a gig
somewhere I really belong.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.943
The hospital.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.448
You know, now that
you've come at me...

40:10.408 --> 40:13.077
...you should probably
watch your back.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.500
He's been working off the grid
here and there in Canada.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.627
I followed up
with a few of his employers,

40:21.669 --> 40:23.129
and he pretty much
keeps to himself.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.755
That's what they say
about serial killers.

40:25.881 --> 40:27.383
Any unpaid credit cards?

40:27.425 --> 40:29.051
Something's off about this guy.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.803
I just need to protect Dom.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.222
Look, with exes,
it always comes down to alimony.

40:33.264 --> 40:35.099
But Dominique's safe.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.436
Brady's married to a Millie Cox.

40:39.395 --> 40:41.021
Millie Cox?

40:41.063 --> 40:44.024
That's my mom's legal name.

40:44.066 --> 40:46.485
There's no divorce record?
Are-are you sure?

40:46.527 --> 40:48.696
Well, nothing was ever filed.

40:49.655 --> 40:52.658
Thanks. I'll, uh, I'll call you
if I need you for anything.

40:54.160 --> 40:58.664
("Break It to Me Gently"
playing)

40:58.706 --> 41:00.791
âª If you must take âª

41:02.543 --> 41:04.628

41:07.006 --> 41:11.427

41:11.469 --> 41:13.262

41:13.304 --> 41:15.973

41:16.015 --> 41:19.101

41:20.519 --> 41:21.979
âª Give me time âª

41:22.021 --> 41:24.398
âª Oh, give me a little time âª

41:24.440 --> 41:27.401
âª To ease the pain âª

41:30.446 --> 41:32.615
