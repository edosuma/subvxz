00:02.930 --> 00:04.614
Hey, Sam.

00:04.648 --> 00:05.715
How's it going?

00:05.749 --> 00:07.567
Fine. You?

00:07.601 --> 00:08.668
All good.

00:11.939 --> 00:13.556
Hey, what was that?

00:13.591 --> 00:15.925
Sexual tension, my
friend. Sexual tension.

00:15.960 --> 00:18.795
<i>Subtle flirting and double entendres.</i>

00:18.846 --> 00:19.929
None of those things just happened.

00:19.980 --> 00:22.715
What show are you watching?

00:22.766 --> 00:24.901
Hey, bro, you've got
to get over this fixation.

00:24.935 --> 00:26.869
Sam's an amazing manager, we need her.

00:26.904 --> 00:29.689
Hey, Ben, don't forget to
pay the beer distributor.

00:29.723 --> 00:30.807
I'm on it.

00:30.809 --> 00:33.643
Oh, my god. You could
cut it with a knife.

00:46.824 --> 00:47.824
Hey, Ben.

00:47.875 --> 00:50.827
Just wondering if you
wanted to grab some coffee?

00:52.746 --> 00:54.664
Because I'm lame.

00:55.666 --> 00:57.000
Heya, Ben, remember how

00:57.051 --> 00:59.802
after you helped the little guy
here crawl out of my hoo-ha...

01:01.755 --> 01:03.640
Don't try and be funny.

01:03.674 --> 01:04.757
He's just a cute guy, just say hi.

01:04.808 --> 01:05.842
Zoey?

01:05.844 --> 01:07.810
Tucker. Hi.

01:09.730 --> 01:11.648
You weren't supposed to hear that.

01:11.682 --> 01:12.815
You're probably
wondering why...

01:12.850 --> 01:14.684
Why you're standing in
front of our apartment

01:14.735 --> 01:15.685
talking to yourself?

01:16.854 --> 01:18.771
I'm sensing you might

01:18.822 --> 01:19.856
have a little crush on somebody.

01:20.858 --> 01:22.859
Oh, my god. I am so embarrassed.

01:22.861 --> 01:24.827
Can we please just forget
that this ever happened?

01:24.862 --> 01:26.696
Yeah, we could, but...

01:27.698 --> 01:29.615
what if the feeling was mutual?

01:30.701 --> 01:31.834
Oh, my god, really?

01:31.869 --> 01:34.704
Oh! That's so great!

01:34.755 --> 01:35.788
But what do I do now?

01:35.839 --> 01:37.674
Because I don't want
things to be awkward

01:37.708 --> 01:38.791
after everything Ben
and I have been through.

01:38.842 --> 01:40.843
Why don't you just let
me talk to him first?

01:40.878 --> 01:42.712
Okay.

01:42.763 --> 01:44.714
Yeah. But just... try
to be cool about it.

01:44.716 --> 01:45.798
Please don't make a big deal.

01:45.849 --> 01:48.685
Trust me, if there is one thing

01:48.719 --> 01:49.769
that I know how to do...

01:50.854 --> 01:52.638
it's be cool, girl.

01:57.728 --> 01:59.696
Ben, you are not gonna
believe what just happened!

02:00.781 --> 02:02.699
Zoey totally hit on me.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.600
My Zoey?

02:04.635 --> 02:07.587
No, the Zoey formerly
known as your Zoey.

02:07.638 --> 02:09.639
Dude, she's into me now. But
only if you're cool with it.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.541
Yeah. I mean, I guess.

02:11.543 --> 02:12.592
Thank you, man, you're the best.

02:13.644 --> 02:15.011
Oh, I've got to go lay
myself out some outfits.

02:17.564 --> 02:18.931
Well, there's another
girl I won't be getting.

02:19.983 --> 02:21.834
You'll never leave me, right?

02:22.936 --> 02:23.953
Emma?

02:23.987 --> 02:25.955
Where...

02:25.989 --> 02:27.924
Hey, seriously, I was talking
to you. Where are you going?

02:27.958 --> 02:29.726
Come on. There you are.

02:34.698 --> 02:36.716
Oh, good morning, babe. What's going on?

02:36.750 --> 02:39.035
(scoffs) One of the stupid
partner's stupid sisters

02:39.069 --> 02:42.555
is getting a stupid divorce and they're
making me handle the stupid case.

02:43.607 --> 02:44.974
That sounds stupid.

02:45.008 --> 02:46.542
It is. It is.

02:46.593 --> 02:48.027
And, because it's my boss's sister,

02:48.062 --> 02:50.997
every little thing that I do is
gonna get reported back to him.

02:51.048 --> 02:52.899
Oh, and get this, Joan...

02:52.933 --> 02:54.033
her stupid name is Joan...

02:54.068 --> 02:56.836
wants to be my friend.

02:56.870 --> 02:58.821
Like, hang out, have cocktails.

02:58.872 --> 03:00.773
I honestly can't think of anything worse

03:00.808 --> 03:04.594
than spending my free time with
a drunk, middle-aged, divorcee.

03:04.628 --> 03:05.645
Hey, guys.

03:07.798 --> 03:10.600
Your morning just got better.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.668
I know exactly what you're gonna ask.

03:12.703 --> 03:13.719
Why you're here?

03:13.754 --> 03:15.605
- Why you didn't knock?
- Why you're using my purse?

03:17.591 --> 03:18.941
All valid.

03:18.976 --> 03:20.910
But the real question is,

03:20.944 --> 03:23.896
"When is Bonnie Wheeler
gonna start dating again?"

03:23.931 --> 03:25.748
Answer: now.

03:26.967 --> 03:30.787
Uh, any chance you've run
that question past Brad,

03:30.789 --> 03:31.838
your husband?

03:31.872 --> 03:33.673
(scoffs)

03:33.724 --> 03:34.774
I can't date him.

03:34.808 --> 03:36.793
He's off climbing overseas

03:36.827 --> 03:39.595
when he should be
climbing over these D's.

03:41.698 --> 03:42.999
Give it. Give it.

03:44.585 --> 03:45.701
I don't want to.

03:45.736 --> 03:48.638
All right, but calm down. Okay?

03:48.672 --> 03:50.973
You know, it's not like I'm
gonna be sleeping with anyone.

03:51.008 --> 03:53.593
I'm just feeling the need for
a little male companionship.

03:53.627 --> 03:55.945
And this is where you come in.

03:55.996 --> 03:58.764
You are gonna be my wing girl.

03:59.950 --> 04:01.801
Um, Mom...

04:01.852 --> 04:04.620
she, like you, already has a man:

04:04.671 --> 04:05.755
me, your son,

04:05.757 --> 04:06.806
who's sitting right here.

04:08.659 --> 04:09.792
She's not gonna meet anyone.

04:09.794 --> 04:12.728
It's just that women are
more approachable in twos.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.630
I'll peel off the hot one

04:14.632 --> 04:16.899
and Riley can have one of
her boring conversations

04:16.950 --> 04:18.584
to distract his less-attractive friend.

04:19.887 --> 04:21.938
Start with your job or your
love of plaid or something.

04:21.940 --> 04:22.872
I
Don't...

04:25.859 --> 04:28.845
So, what do you say to going
out and having a few cocktails?

04:33.734 --> 04:37.803
I say I think this could be the
beginning of a beautiful friendship.

04:37.855 --> 04:39.789
Not with me, with someone else.

04:43.694 --> 04:45.027
Here you go, you stud.

04:45.029 --> 04:46.562
How's the date going so far?

04:46.597 --> 04:48.948
Great. Amazing. Perfect.

04:48.982 --> 04:51.634
Dude, she is so into me, man.

04:51.668 --> 04:53.019
I mean, she's already
trying to make me jealous.

04:53.070 --> 04:54.854
She keeps talking about you.

04:54.905 --> 04:55.905
Classic chick.

04:59.860 --> 05:00.826
I like you, Perrin.

05:00.878 --> 05:02.728
You remind me of me when I was your age,

05:02.779 --> 05:05.715
but with cheaper shoes
and less confidence.

05:05.766 --> 05:07.833
I just can't believe you are
pawning me off on some stranger

05:07.868 --> 05:10.786
like I'm a kid with an overbite and a
helmet nobody wants to be buddies with.

05:10.821 --> 05:12.772
No, no, not a stranger.

05:12.823 --> 05:16.559
Bonnie is a close,
dear person that I know.

05:16.561 --> 05:18.628
And, I just, I think you two
would have a lot in common.

05:18.662 --> 05:21.647
Plus, this will give me more
time to work on your divorce.

05:21.682 --> 05:23.900
And I am all about work.

05:23.951 --> 05:25.585
Feel free to mention
that to your brother.

05:25.636 --> 05:26.969
(cellphone rings)

05:27.020 --> 05:29.855
Oh, speaking of my parents' failed
attempt to save their marriage,

05:29.890 --> 05:30.973
that's him.

05:31.008 --> 05:32.775
Joan: Hello, Michael.

05:34.077 --> 05:37.697
No, no. The matchstick you
forced on me is doing a fine job.

05:37.731 --> 05:42.685
Actually, the matchstick
looks like she's a matchmaker.

05:42.736 --> 05:45.755
And she is about to set me up
with a tall drink of blonde ale.

05:45.806 --> 05:48.024
And Mama's thirsty.

05:54.014 --> 05:55.932
Dude, why can't I just ask Sam out?

05:55.934 --> 05:57.533
Don't say it's because I'm her boss.

05:57.584 --> 05:59.035
Then I won't say it with my mouth.
I'll just say it with my eyes.

06:00.887 --> 06:01.904
(groans)

06:01.955 --> 06:03.489
It's so unfair.

06:03.523 --> 06:05.775
I've wanted to go out with
Sam since I was 14 years old.

06:05.826 --> 06:07.677
I just wish I knew how she felt.

06:08.729 --> 06:10.663
Hey, I know. You
could find out...

06:10.697 --> 06:11.664
- Not happening.
- Please?

06:11.715 --> 06:12.732
- Forget it.
- Don't make me...

06:12.766 --> 06:13.733
You wouldn't.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.618
I gave up Riley for you.

06:15.620 --> 06:16.752
Oh-ho.

06:16.754 --> 06:18.504
Fine.

06:18.538 --> 06:19.655
Just see if she's into me.

06:19.706 --> 06:21.557
But be subtle.

06:22.726 --> 06:24.961
Though, not like that, 'cause
that isn't subtle at all.

06:27.931 --> 06:28.998
Hey, you.

06:29.032 --> 06:31.517
What's new?

06:31.551 --> 06:32.952
Just looking over
these inventory reports.

06:32.986 --> 06:35.755
I really need some one-on-one time
to go over them with your brother.

06:35.789 --> 06:37.807
Oh, yeah, my brother.

06:37.809 --> 06:38.908
Pfft, great guy.

06:38.910 --> 06:41.677
Love him. Speaking of having a drink...

06:41.728 --> 06:42.812
We weren't talking about having a drink.

06:42.814 --> 06:44.797
Well, we are now.

06:44.848 --> 06:46.682
It's called guiding the conversation.

06:48.001 --> 06:50.686
Would you ever consider going
out with someone you work with?

06:50.721 --> 06:54.590
It's kind of unprofessional,
so... depends who's asking.

06:54.641 --> 06:57.009
Look, we both know what's going on here.

06:57.044 --> 07:01.497
The sexual tension, the subtle
flirting, the double entrées.

07:02.866 --> 07:04.483
I'm catching on.

07:04.518 --> 07:06.018
One drink.

07:06.053 --> 07:08.721
Just talk about old times and if
you're not into it, no harm, no foul.

07:08.772 --> 07:09.772
What about Riley?

07:09.806 --> 07:11.707
Oh, that's ancient history.

07:11.775 --> 07:12.758
So what do you say?

07:13.810 --> 07:16.712
I say sure. Why not? To old times.

07:16.763 --> 07:18.648
I'll look at my calendar

07:18.699 --> 07:20.633
and can you just let
Ben know about all this?

07:20.667 --> 07:23.519
Oh, I'll let Ben know about everything.

07:25.689 --> 07:26.639
(both laughing)

07:26.673 --> 07:29.525
So, they totally dropped the charges.

07:29.559 --> 07:30.876
Canadians.

07:32.012 --> 07:33.863
This day is looking up.

07:33.897 --> 07:36.966
I started off with a matchstick
and ended up with a bonfire.

07:38.001 --> 07:39.769
You are funsie.

07:39.820 --> 07:40.820
Oh, my god, you're strong.

07:41.872 --> 07:42.872
So do you want another drink?

07:42.923 --> 07:44.940
My sons own this place so
everything's on the house,

07:44.975 --> 07:47.877
which is payback for the
way they lived in my house.

07:47.911 --> 07:49.628
You have kids?

07:49.663 --> 07:51.614
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I'm sensing a story.

07:51.616 --> 07:52.865
Well, I was married,

07:52.916 --> 07:55.618
but you know how it goes when
one of you turns out to be gay.

07:55.652 --> 07:56.702
Oh, but do I.

07:58.588 --> 07:59.605
Oh.

07:59.639 --> 08:01.657
What are you smiling about?

08:01.692 --> 08:03.909
Is there a slow gas
leak in the office again?

08:03.944 --> 08:05.911
I did it. You're having drinks with Sam.

08:05.946 --> 08:07.863
The rest of it's up to you, bro.

08:07.898 --> 08:10.483
What? I said feel her
out, not ask her out.

08:10.517 --> 08:11.784
I told you to be subtle, Danny.

08:11.852 --> 08:13.936
Hey, Danny, I checked my
calendar and I'm wide open.

08:13.938 --> 08:15.921
Any night you want to go out
for that drink is good with me.

08:18.742 --> 08:19.825
May have been a little too subtle.

08:23.516 --> 08:26.145
I can't believe that Sam
thinks you asked her out for you.

08:26.245 --> 08:29.180
Now I need to undo what you
did and redo what you didn't do

08:29.231 --> 08:32.049
and do what I should have done in
the first place. You understand?

08:32.051 --> 08:32.515
Do you?

08:34.152 --> 08:36.037
Hey, Sam, two seconds.

08:37.456 --> 08:40.474
So, about that little conversation
you just had with Danny,

08:40.509 --> 08:42.393
he was wrong to ask you out.

08:42.427 --> 08:43.427
He's with Riley.

08:43.429 --> 08:44.528
He is?

08:44.530 --> 08:46.247
What a jerk.

08:46.281 --> 08:48.215
Yeah, he sure can be.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.051
I'm annoyed with him, too.

08:50.085 --> 08:52.353
Did he at least tell you that I wanted
to have some one-on-one time with you?

08:52.404 --> 08:54.238
No, he did not.

08:54.289 --> 08:56.140
Even more annoyed.

08:56.174 --> 08:57.275
Well, I'm kinda swamped
right now but maybe

08:57.277 --> 08:59.243
we can sit down over a drink after work?

08:59.245 --> 09:01.062
Yeah, yeah, sounds great.

09:04.049 --> 09:05.066
It's almost too easy.

09:09.037 --> 09:11.472
Well, I'm guessing your mom
and Joan hit it off last night

09:11.523 --> 09:13.457
because I haven't heard
from either of them.

09:13.492 --> 09:14.458
Win-win.

09:14.509 --> 09:16.010
(cellphone rings)

09:16.044 --> 09:18.262
Ugh, it's Joan. Lose-lose.

09:19.414 --> 09:21.215
Joan, hi.

09:21.266 --> 09:22.316
Oh, what a nice surprise.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.251
So, how was your night with Bonnie?

09:24.286 --> 09:25.336
<i>Joan: Fantastic.</i>

09:25.338 --> 09:27.271
Best date I have been on in a long time.

09:29.207 --> 09:31.108
I'm sorry. (giggles)

09:31.143 --> 09:32.193
<i>- Did you say date?
- Joan: Mm-hmm.</i>

09:32.227 --> 09:34.245
It was such a great
change from my ex-wife.

09:34.279 --> 09:36.447
She used to hate when
I dated other women.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.433
Your ex-wife.

09:40.469 --> 09:41.452
Right.

09:41.454 --> 09:43.521
I know all about her.

09:43.555 --> 09:45.373
Hey, um,

09:45.407 --> 09:47.291
can I call you back? I
have to go to a meeting.

09:47.342 --> 09:48.509
(stammers) (girly voice)
Excuse me, Miss Perrin,

09:48.543 --> 09:50.461
you're needed in the conference room.

09:53.315 --> 09:55.366
I am so sorry. Great
talk. All right, bye.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.861
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no,

09:57.887 --> 10:00.321
no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

10:00.355 --> 10:04.175
"Joan Carpenter vs Linda Moyer."

10:04.177 --> 10:05.276
Oh, my god!

10:07.162 --> 10:09.130
Wow, you probably
should have noticed that.

10:12.517 --> 10:13.551
Noticed that I love you.

10:16.121 --> 10:19.407
"And when the prince gave
the sleepy maiden a kiss,

10:19.441 --> 10:22.460
"the fairy godmother
whispered in his ear... "

10:22.494 --> 10:23.477
She's a lesbian!

10:25.364 --> 10:27.398
Actually, she's a frog.

10:27.432 --> 10:31.152
And congratulations, now you've
outed her to the entire kingdom.

10:31.186 --> 10:33.287
No! Joan.

10:33.338 --> 10:35.172
She thought that you two
were on a date last night

10:35.223 --> 10:36.340
and she wants to go out with you again.

10:36.342 --> 10:38.109
I know.

10:38.111 --> 10:39.210
What? What? What do you mean you know?

10:39.244 --> 10:42.146
Oh, sweetie, I know when
a woman is hitting on me.

10:42.148 --> 10:43.547
I had an after-school
job at the hardware store.

10:44.583 --> 10:46.400
And you didn't say anything?

10:46.451 --> 10:48.586
Uh, to somebody who is
telling me how beautiful I am

10:48.588 --> 10:50.438
and paying for my lobster?

10:50.472 --> 10:52.239
No.

10:52.290 --> 10:55.309
I mean, I figured there's nothing wrong
with dipping my toe in the lady pond

10:55.343 --> 10:57.244
as long as I don't go swimming.

10:57.279 --> 11:00.264
Well, what happens when Joan
finds out that you're straight?

11:00.266 --> 11:01.649
I'll tell you, I'll
tell you what happens.

11:01.683 --> 11:05.302
She tells her brother, my boss, that
I obviously didn't read her file.

11:05.337 --> 11:06.337
Oh, my god!

11:06.388 --> 11:08.272
Okay. All right.

11:08.274 --> 11:10.207
This is fine. Don't panic.

11:10.258 --> 11:12.209
We can totally figure this out.

11:12.244 --> 11:14.195
I just need to stay calm.

11:14.229 --> 11:16.097
Hey, is Ben around?

11:16.131 --> 11:17.398
No, Ben is not around!

11:17.432 --> 11:19.100
Can you not see that we are
in the middle of a crisis here?

11:20.552 --> 11:21.519
Okay.

11:23.105 --> 11:24.155
Deep breaths.

11:24.157 --> 11:25.456
Just gonna take a quick pause.

11:27.509 --> 11:30.377
Oh, my god. I know, I know.
I know, I know, I know.

11:30.412 --> 11:32.513
Okay, I need you to
go out with her again

11:32.547 --> 11:35.332
and tell her that is all just too soon

11:35.367 --> 11:38.269
and let her down easy.
Please? That would be perfect.

11:38.303 --> 11:39.336
Please?

11:41.339 --> 11:43.157
Okay, I'll do it.

11:43.191 --> 11:45.226
But under one condition.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.244
- What?
- I don't know.

11:47.246 --> 11:50.147
But I will think of something
horrible for you later.

11:51.283 --> 11:53.200
Wait, did I hear Zoey?

11:55.187 --> 11:56.353
Zoey!

11:56.388 --> 11:59.557
Hey, I sort of got the impression
that this is a bad time.

11:59.591 --> 12:01.091
I'll just see you later.

12:01.093 --> 12:02.476
Hey, girl. No, no, no.
It's never a bad time.

12:02.511 --> 12:03.511
What's wrong?

12:05.096 --> 12:06.313
(sighs)

12:06.364 --> 12:08.382
To be honest, I'm
starting to get frustrated.

12:09.434 --> 12:11.285
We haven't had any time to connect.

12:11.319 --> 12:13.420
We haven't even been alone together.

12:13.455 --> 12:15.306
Oh.

12:15.357 --> 12:18.209
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I could
definitely make that happen.

12:18.243 --> 12:19.226
Yeah.

12:19.311 --> 12:20.277
Well, what about tonight?

12:20.312 --> 12:22.163
Dinner for two?

12:22.197 --> 12:24.131
Uh, that would be amazing.

12:24.182 --> 12:26.066
What time does Ben get home from work?

12:26.101 --> 12:27.501
Damn, I'm not sure.

12:27.552 --> 12:30.070
Um, how about eight
o'clock? We should be safe.

12:30.105 --> 12:32.089
Oh, wait, I don't have a babysitter.

12:32.123 --> 12:33.474
What if I came to your place?

12:33.508 --> 12:34.525
- (elevator dings)
- Really?

12:34.576 --> 12:37.328
Thank you. You are just the sweetest.

12:37.379 --> 12:38.429
Muah!

12:38.463 --> 12:39.513
Oh, my god. A real date.

12:39.564 --> 12:41.365
Is it wrong that I'm this excited?

12:41.367 --> 12:43.300
No, not at all. I am too.

12:43.385 --> 12:44.468
You just can't tell, it's a thick robe.

12:50.258 --> 12:51.358
Ask me how my first date
with Sam was last night.

12:51.409 --> 12:53.177
Go ahead, ask me.

12:53.211 --> 12:54.161
How was...

12:54.196 --> 12:55.262
Amazing! (laughs)

12:55.313 --> 12:57.214
Perfect. Best first date ever.

12:57.249 --> 12:59.550
You know, once I finally got
her to shut up about work.

12:59.601 --> 13:01.519
We had a drink,

13:01.521 --> 13:04.421
which turned into dinner which
turned into a walk in the park.

13:04.472 --> 13:06.106
I was a total gentleman.

13:06.141 --> 13:08.092
The boob graze appeared accidental.

13:09.427 --> 13:10.528
Morning, boys.

13:10.562 --> 13:12.329
Good morning, Sam.

13:12.380 --> 13:14.348
I should get used to saying that.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.434
Okay, so, back to work for me.

13:21.389 --> 13:22.423
So...

13:22.457 --> 13:25.276
sounds like you and Ben
had a nice date last night.

13:25.310 --> 13:27.278
Date? That was not a date.

13:27.280 --> 13:28.596
Are you sure?

13:28.630 --> 13:31.315
Yeah, we went over the inventory,
then grabbed a hot dog and a soda

13:31.349 --> 13:33.150
while he walked me to the subway.

13:33.184 --> 13:34.552
So, totally not a date.

13:34.586 --> 13:37.071
And it sounds like you're being jealous,

13:37.105 --> 13:39.073
which is odd since
you have a girlfriend.

13:39.107 --> 13:41.442
Yeah. Sorry, a little miscommunication.

13:41.493 --> 13:42.493
Apparently.

13:44.429 --> 13:46.564
But, you know, I have
always liked you, Danny.

13:46.598 --> 13:48.499
So if you ever do break up with her,

13:48.550 --> 13:51.318
just give me a sign.

13:51.353 --> 13:52.469
Wait. Wait, wait. Are you saying

13:52.504 --> 13:54.338
that you want me to let
you know when I'm single

13:54.372 --> 13:55.439
because you want to go out with me?

13:55.473 --> 13:58.158
Yeah, is there a gas
leak in here or something?

13:59.261 --> 14:01.178
Okay, can you just excuse
me for a quick second?

14:02.197 --> 14:03.197
Ben!

14:07.358 --> 14:08.295
Hey, little bro.

14:08.395 --> 14:10.935
You got a quick two seconds
to hear a really funny story?

14:11.035 --> 14:12.936
It's about Sam. She, uh...

14:12.970 --> 14:14.270
It really is funny.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.273
She didn't think your date was a date,

14:17.308 --> 14:18.975
and she kind of hinted

14:19.026 --> 14:21.294
pretty heavily that if I was
free, she would want to date me.

14:25.199 --> 14:27.066
How big is your ego?

14:28.285 --> 14:31.070
Can't you believe for one
second that given a choice,

14:31.105 --> 14:33.022
someone might actually like me better?

14:33.073 --> 14:35.041
Yeah, I guess that'd be possible.

14:35.043 --> 14:37.110
Possible?

14:37.144 --> 14:39.379
I'm sorry. I just didn't want
your feelings to get hurt.

14:39.413 --> 14:40.947
If you don't believe
me, you can ask her.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.949
Oh. Oh, I will. Hey, uh, Sam?

14:42.951 --> 14:45.001
What do you say we
finish what we started?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.319
My place, eight o'clock.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.271
Sure, that'd be great. I'll be there.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.243
Looks like it's Ben: one, Danny: zero.

14:53.277 --> 14:54.327
What about Riley?

14:54.378 --> 14:56.262
What about Riley?
She's not even playing.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.184
♪ I eat pie alone at the sink ♪

15:02.269 --> 15:04.037
♪ But I'm not a loser ♪

15:04.039 --> 15:07.023
♪ 'Cause I have a professional
hockey player boyfriend ♪

15:08.075 --> 15:09.042
Hey, Riles.

15:12.146 --> 15:13.930
I'll miss you.

15:15.583 --> 15:18.051
What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed
to be breaking up with Joan right now?

15:18.053 --> 15:19.352
She'll be here in a minute.

15:19.354 --> 15:20.987
Wait, wait, why is she coming here?

15:21.038 --> 15:22.455
Well, I can't do it at my place.

15:22.506 --> 15:25.875
Whenever I break up with someone, I
like to have a really dramatic exit.

15:25.910 --> 15:27.327
And goodbye!

15:28.345 --> 15:29.863
(knocking on door)

15:32.216 --> 15:33.967
<i>Hey, Chiquita Bonita.</i>

15:34.018 --> 15:37.270
I brought the essentials: wine, cheese,
and pajamas I'm not going to wear.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.105
Ah! (forced giggle)

15:39.139 --> 15:42.041
Oh, listen, um, Joanie,
uh, we need to talk.

15:42.076 --> 15:44.210
Oh, you remembered my favorite wine.

15:44.212 --> 15:47.163
Well, that'll make things
go down a lot easier.

15:47.198 --> 15:49.132
Don't supposed you bought
a bottle for you, huh?

15:49.166 --> 15:51.985
Oh, my gosh, you're so pretty.

15:51.987 --> 15:52.952
Oh, okay.

15:57.992 --> 15:59.392
Hello.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.895
Thank you so much for coming over.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.265
Make yourself comfortable.

16:05.267 --> 16:07.850
There's a bottle in the fridge,
he'll probably sleep the whole time.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.202
I just fed him.

16:09.253 --> 16:11.154
Hold on, where are you going?

16:11.188 --> 16:12.272
Dinner.

16:15.125 --> 16:17.026
Oh, takeout.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.995
Oh, perfect.

16:19.029 --> 16:20.179
Yeah, I hope she gets Chinese.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Zoey: Hello?

16:24.051 --> 16:26.052
Out here, on the fire escape.

16:26.054 --> 16:27.904
(cars honking)

16:29.073 --> 16:31.891
I thought maybe we could
start off with a little...

16:31.942 --> 16:32.992
Zoey, hi.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.878
This is so lovely.

16:35.913 --> 16:38.865
Oh, I usually don't, but since
tonight's a special occasion...

16:38.916 --> 16:41.317
Um, isn't Tucker a part
of that special occasion?

16:41.352 --> 16:44.120
Yeah, he's upstairs watching Hunter.

16:44.154 --> 16:47.106
He wanted to make sure you and I
finally had some alone time together.

16:48.242 --> 16:50.176
I think you lost me
somewhere, can you start again?

16:54.081 --> 16:55.081
Oh, Sam?

16:55.132 --> 16:57.016
Danny, what's going on?

16:57.067 --> 17:00.119
Oh, uh, just a lovely romantic dinner.

17:00.121 --> 17:01.921
For me?

17:01.972 --> 17:03.056
Yeah, it was all Ben's idea.

17:03.090 --> 17:05.040
Wow, thank you, Ben.

17:05.075 --> 17:08.261
Well, you can thank him
in person, I'll go get him.

17:08.311 --> 17:10.946
I don't really need Ben,
but I guess this is the sign.

17:12.883 --> 17:16.269
(chuckles) It's funny, I feel like I've
been dating Tucker the last few days.

17:16.271 --> 17:18.371
That is funny.

17:18.373 --> 17:21.156
So funny. Hey, can you excuse
me for just two seconds?

17:21.191 --> 17:22.191
I got to make a quick phone call.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.212
Sam!

17:26.262 --> 17:28.181
Ben! Oh!

17:28.232 --> 17:30.283
Thank you so much for putting all
this together, you are beyond sweet.

17:30.334 --> 17:32.168
That sounds like a hug moment.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.103
If you could just excuse me
for one second. I'm just...

17:34.138 --> 17:35.188
Hey, Ben, can I borrow some condoms?

17:35.239 --> 17:38.941
Zoey's baby reminded me
that I do not want a baby.

17:38.976 --> 17:41.027
Yeah, they're actually in my
bedroom. If we could talk back there...

17:41.029 --> 17:43.079
Tucker? Is something wrong with Hunter?

17:43.130 --> 17:46.032
No. No, something is wrong with
me. What are you doing down here?

17:46.066 --> 17:48.334
Oh, good. There you are.

17:48.385 --> 17:49.969
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

17:49.971 --> 17:51.104
I'm having dinner with Ben.

17:51.155 --> 17:53.339
Not entirely true, I'm
actually having dinner with Sam.

17:53.374 --> 17:54.891
I thought this was for me and Danny.

17:54.925 --> 17:55.975
Why would you think that?

17:56.010 --> 17:57.276
Maybe 'cause you keep hitting on her!

18:00.197 --> 18:01.814
So you don't want to go out with me?

18:01.865 --> 18:03.199
And you don't want to go out with me?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.217
Hold up.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.269
Does anybody want to go out with me?

18:09.056 --> 18:11.057
I just want to thank you
for understanding that...

18:12.076 --> 18:13.960
I'm just not ready yet.

18:13.994 --> 18:17.013
I'm getting over a really bad breakup.

18:17.064 --> 18:18.064
It's really a shame, Bonnie.

18:18.115 --> 18:21.934
I've never met a woman
who's so direct and honest.

18:21.936 --> 18:22.985
That's me.

18:23.070 --> 18:24.954
Honest as the day is long.

18:25.005 --> 18:26.039
Ah, this day is long.

18:27.341 --> 18:28.941
Oh, my god!

18:30.911 --> 18:33.212
Riley! Wait, what is
she doing in your closet?

18:33.247 --> 18:36.199
Well, uh, obviously spying on me.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.333
I told you, we're through!

18:39.219 --> 18:40.236
Riley is your ex?

18:40.270 --> 18:42.205
Joan, I, uh...
I can explain.

18:44.308 --> 18:46.059
Riley: Oh, Joan, wait!

18:46.110 --> 18:47.193
Bonnie: Joan, wait!

18:47.195 --> 18:49.011
Sam: You told me you'd
broken up with Riley.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.129
- Uh, quick detour. Go, go!
- Okay.

18:51.165 --> 18:53.032
I can't believe you stole my date.

18:53.067 --> 18:55.001
Get in line, Danny stole mine first.

18:55.035 --> 18:56.969
Excuse me, who's date did Danny steal?

18:57.004 --> 18:57.987
I'm not dating anyone.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.072
Yeah, not anymore you're not.

19:00.891 --> 19:01.924
He asked me out.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.826
For Ben, I did it for Ben.

19:03.861 --> 19:05.278
You know what, I always
knew that you liked him

19:05.329 --> 19:07.930
and you just couldn't
wait to swoop in, could ya?

19:07.965 --> 19:10.950
Well, I'm sorry. I always
thought you were a lesbian anyway.

19:12.002 --> 19:13.836
I am not a lesbian.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.221
You play field hockey.

19:15.223 --> 19:16.255
I can't be the only one, right?

19:16.290 --> 19:19.208
(guys chattering)

19:19.243 --> 19:23.196
Super sorry to interrupt, but what
the hell did you think was going on?

19:23.230 --> 19:24.447
Tucker said you hit on him.

19:24.498 --> 19:27.133
She did. She was lurking around
our door looking for something.

19:27.184 --> 19:29.302
I mean, what else is a young,
confident man to assume?

19:31.121 --> 19:33.122
Ben! I was talking about Ben.

19:33.157 --> 19:35.074
I thought we had a connection.

19:35.076 --> 19:37.093
We did! But I thought you
just wanted to be friends.

19:37.127 --> 19:38.344
So you thought you'd
go after me instead?

19:38.378 --> 19:40.296
If you wanted to go out with
me, why didn't you just ask me?

19:40.347 --> 19:42.181
- Will you go out with me?
- No!

19:43.217 --> 19:46.052
I'm not dating you, you, or you!

19:46.103 --> 19:47.136
Hey, I didn't even ask.

19:48.222 --> 19:50.106
She's right I was about to, though.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.277
Zoey, I am so sorry about all this.

19:56.113 --> 19:59.198
But it turns out I am
free for dinner now.

19:59.233 --> 20:02.068
And you'll likely stay that
way for a very long time.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
Hey, babe.

20:04.154 --> 20:06.155
What about us? We still on for dinner?

20:10.294 --> 20:12.245
She's probably just getting her jacket.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.298
You guys want a beer?

20:20.728 --> 20:22.362
Dude, isn't it obvious?

20:22.364 --> 20:24.581
Eat your food and watch the hot
girls on the Spanish channel.

20:24.615 --> 20:25.582
Oh.

20:26.617 --> 20:27.584
<i>(music on TV)</i>

20:27.618 --> 20:28.702
Shove over, losers.

20:30.705 --> 20:32.706
I just lost the hottest thing
that ever happened to me.

20:32.708 --> 20:34.674
Oh, you miss Brad, don't you?

20:34.709 --> 20:35.759
Oh, god, no.

20:35.793 --> 20:37.677
I miss Joan.

20:39.597 --> 20:41.548
Your father might have the right idea.

20:42.633 --> 20:44.634
Ooh, look. Hot Spanish chicks.
