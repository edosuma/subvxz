00:16.975 --> 00:21.187
<i>The world was split into the East and the West.</i>

00:28.403 --> 00:31.865
<i>The Western Nations, led by the Queen,</i>

00:31.948 --> 00:35.744
<i>were in conflict with the Eastern Nations.</i>

00:35.827 --> 00:40.165
<i>In order to rule the entire world,</i>

00:40.248 --> 00:43.585
<i>the Queen of the West sent her most</i>
<i>highly trusted aristocrats</i>

00:43.668 --> 00:45.879
<i>to the other nations as spies.</i>

00:50.008 --> 00:54.721
<i>They were called the "Queen's Watchdogs,"</i>

00:54.804 --> 00:56.431
<i>and they were feared.</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:02.937
<i>Next, the news.</i>
<i>In the early hours of the morning,</i>

01:03.021 --> 01:07.108
<i>another mummified body was found</i>
<i>in the No. 4 Industrial District.</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:10.320
<i>Including mummified bodies</i>
<i>discovered three weeks ago</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:13.281
<i>in the Mountain Forest District,</i>
<i>this is the seventh.</i>

01:13.364 --> 01:16.201
<i>The Ministry for State Security</i>
<i>has not yet made</i>

01:16.284 --> 01:18.620
<i>a definite statement concerning the death.</i>

01:18.703 --> 01:21.289
<i>The Western government</i>
<i>has ceded their willingness</i>

01:21.372 --> 01:25.293
<i>to lend our country their full support</i>
<i>in the investigation...</i>

03:19.782 --> 03:23.328
<i>They're too rough</i>
<i>to be in human trafficking.</i>

03:23.411 --> 03:25.371
<i>What are they using these women for?</i>

03:31.085 --> 03:32.754
Who are you?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.090
Why do you have these pictures?

03:39.302 --> 03:41.679
You're not just a normal girl.

03:43.306 --> 03:47.727
Most of the people who were mummified
came into contact with you before they died.

03:50.146 --> 03:53.399
What's in that envelope in the picture?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.111
I have no idea.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.243
Don't look at me like that!

04:47.287 --> 04:49.872
Excuse me for intruding.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.332
Who are you?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.963
Pardon me.

04:57.046 --> 05:00.842
I'm from the Genpo family.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.970
Master, I have come...

05:04.053 --> 05:06.180
for you.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.515
Master?

05:24.699 --> 05:25.867
What's that?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.668
Kill them.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.463
As you wish.

07:30.241 --> 07:31.492
Who are you?

07:33.286 --> 07:34.287
Me?

07:37.540 --> 07:39.375
I'm a demon...

07:39.459 --> 07:41.752
and also a butler.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.464
How could some butler kill everyone like this!?

07:44.547 --> 07:47.216
What are you talking about?

07:47.300 --> 07:49.469
This is nothing...

07:49.552 --> 07:51.971
for a butler of the Genpo family.

07:56.684 --> 08:00.271
What are you going to do now?

08:16.204 --> 08:17.580
Sebastian!

08:17.663 --> 08:20.458
Sebastian!

08:20.541 --> 08:23.461
I named him after my dog.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.546
You don't seem upset.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.471
You're odd-eyed.

08:33.554 --> 08:37.016
That's rare. I could get a high price for you.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.353
Tell me! Where did you get that picture?

08:40.436 --> 08:41.896
Who are you?

08:44.941 --> 08:46.067
Hey.

08:47.985 --> 08:49.529
Quit playing around.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.368
Does lying there really feel that good?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.455
I guess I hit you too hard.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.334
Dear me.

09:05.336 --> 09:08.089
Guns...

09:08.172 --> 09:10.716
have gotten better these days.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.346
They're not like the guns from long ago.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.404
No way.

09:31.487 --> 09:34.073
The clothes I got from my father

09:34.156 --> 09:36.909
are dirty now.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.245
It's because you were playing around,
you idiot.

09:39.328 --> 09:43.708
I was just following your orders, young master.

09:46.043 --> 09:46.919
And...

09:48.462 --> 09:50.715
I thought watching you for a while...

09:51.841 --> 09:53.884
wouldn't be bad.

09:56.095 --> 09:59.640
You look so pathetic. It's beautiful.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.184
It suits you. You're small and weak.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.729
-Don't talk to me like that!
-Shut up!

10:09.358 --> 10:12.695
You know you're going to die, right?

10:14.322 --> 10:16.115
Well...

10:16.198 --> 10:18.159
What shall I do?

10:18.242 --> 10:20.202
Hurry up. My arm hurts.

10:20.286 --> 10:24.373
But, young master,
if I come any closer, he'll kill you.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.543
You bastard! You intend to break the contract?

10:27.627 --> 10:29.587
Of course not.

10:29.670 --> 10:33.633
I've been your loyal servant
ever since that day.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.760
I will do...

10:35.843 --> 10:37.762
anything you wish.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.556
What are you talking about? You monster!

10:40.640 --> 10:43.059
If we don't achieve my goal,

10:43.142 --> 10:45.269
you're not allowed to eat my soul.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.687
Of course.

10:46.771 --> 10:51.984
And your soul won't be mine
if you are killed by someone else.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.028
-Then hurry up!
-Young master.

10:58.032 --> 11:02.161
I taught you how to make a request, didn't I?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.547
It's an order.

11:15.424 --> 11:16.592
Save me.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.180
As you wish.

11:23.599 --> 11:24.934
You bastard!

11:38.531 --> 11:40.783
Give me back my master.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.668
This wasn't that much fun.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.838
Hey, you!

11:54.213 --> 11:55.297
I'll pay five--

11:55.381 --> 11:57.800
No, ten times what she's worth!
So, please--

11:57.883 --> 12:03.222
I haven't the slightest interest
in a piece of trash created by humans.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.810
I told you already...

12:09.437 --> 12:12.606
I'm a demon...

12:14.108 --> 12:15.317
and a butler.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.828
I'll ask again.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.461
What's in that envelope?

12:34.795 --> 12:36.797
This is your last chance.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.175
Tell me everything you know.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.600
I've got nothing to tell you.

12:50.811 --> 12:51.687
You're...

12:53.647 --> 12:56.192
going to get a look at hell.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.777
Really? Then it's game over.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.160
I've already seen hell.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.209
Praying won't help you.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.548
God doesn't exist.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.636
No one will save you.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.394
Well, then, young Master Kiyoharu.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.981
I've prepared a French dinner for tonight.

13:36.065 --> 13:40.194
I've also prepared the desserts-only course
you requested this morning.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.655
Which would you prefer?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.703
-The desserts.
-As you wish.

15:26.634 --> 15:30.554
<i>The Genpo family is a family of aristocrats</i>
<i>that began in the 19th century.</i>

15:32.348 --> 15:35.559
<i>Young Master Kiyoharu, the head of the family,</i>

15:35.643 --> 15:38.354
<i>starts his mornings with early morning tea.</i>

15:40.105 --> 15:41.941
<i>This is Rin, the house maid.</i>

15:43.067 --> 15:47.488
<i>She does many things I'll never understand.</i>

15:50.824 --> 15:54.495
<i>Don't you realize that</i>
<i>it's not because of your eyesight?</i>

15:54.578 --> 15:56.288
<i>It's because you're stupid.</i>

15:56.372 --> 15:59.291
-I'm sorry.
-I'll take care of this.

16:01.877 --> 16:05.965
<i>Sometimes I feel like killing her.</i>

16:06.048 --> 16:09.009
<i>This is Tanaka, the house steward.</i>

16:09.093 --> 16:12.054
<i>His teacup is filled with lemonade.</i>

16:17.434 --> 16:18.894
Good morning.

16:20.479 --> 16:24.400
<i>This is my master, Earl Kiyoharu Genpo.</i>

16:29.989 --> 16:32.908
This aroma... Is this Ceylon?

16:32.992 --> 16:36.120
Yes, and Higgins' Blue Lady.

16:37.579 --> 16:42.001
<i>He's also the president of Funtom,</i>
<i>the biggest toy manufacturer in the East,</i>

16:42.084 --> 16:44.628
<i>even though he's only 17.</i>

16:46.005 --> 16:51.343
<i>He keeps an eye out on the underworld</i>
<i>as one of the Queen's watchdogs.</i>

16:53.053 --> 16:57.266
You were screaming a lot last night.

16:57.349 --> 16:59.977
I had the same dream I always do. All right.

17:09.111 --> 17:12.656
I wish I could stay with you
in your dreams too.

17:14.366 --> 17:18.287
It's okay.
I feel so happy I don't have to see your face.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.457
Damn kid.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.168
It's nothing.

17:24.251 --> 17:25.711
Even if it's a dream,

17:25.794 --> 17:29.590
I can't let you be killed anywhere,
especially when I'm not there with you.

17:31.675 --> 17:32.593
I know.

17:33.802 --> 17:34.887
However...

17:36.472 --> 17:38.223
if you want to commit suicide, go ahead.

17:39.475 --> 17:43.479
If you commit suicide, I still get your soul.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.772
Don't worry.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.650
I won't die...

17:49.902 --> 17:51.278
until I achieve my goal.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.786
That's why I'm dressed like this.

18:09.505 --> 18:12.091
It's no use thinking about it.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.384
The game's already decided.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.344
Well, Sato?

18:17.638 --> 18:20.057
QUEEN'S PRIVATE SECRETARY
CHARLES B. SATO

18:22.726 --> 18:25.562
Your intelligence and management skills

18:25.646 --> 18:29.108
are impressive for someone so young,
Earl Kiyoharu Genpo.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.446
Enough with the flattery.
What do you want?

18:35.864 --> 18:39.576
There's been another victim
of the Demon's Curse.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.997
<i>A staff member at one of our embassies.</i>
<i>Anthony Campbell.</i>

18:44.081 --> 18:46.083
<i>He was mummified when we found him.</i>

18:47.251 --> 18:49.962
<i>They found a card at the scene.</i>

18:50.045 --> 18:52.673
<i>It had a picture of a demon.</i>

18:53.340 --> 18:55.259
This is the eighth person.

18:55.342 --> 18:58.470
The victims are all embassy staff members
from other countries.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.556
It's become a topic of global news.

19:02.641 --> 19:06.103
Some media outlets say
it's the curse of a demon.

19:07.521 --> 19:11.358
So the leaders from both the Eastern
and Western nations are gathering...

19:11.441 --> 19:14.403
to perform an exorcism
and ward off the demons.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.866
-This is stupid.
-In any case,

19:18.949 --> 19:23.328
we can't ignore this now that one of our own
embassy staff members has become a victim.

19:25.914 --> 19:29.710
Her Highness says to resolve this quickly.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.713
Tell Her Highness that I understand.

19:49.062 --> 19:54.526
<i>It all started when a mummy was discovered</i>
<i>three weeks ago.</i>

19:54.610 --> 20:00.741
Since then, there have been multiple incidents
of people being mummified alive.

20:10.626 --> 20:15.422
Everyone's calling it
the case of the Demon's Curse.

20:22.262 --> 20:25.015
Do you have the power to turn people
into mummies?

20:26.725 --> 20:27.768
Who knows.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.649
I'm good at squeezing the juice
out of fruit though.

20:39.029 --> 20:45.285
Many of the victims had contact
with that human trafficker before they died.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.453
What...

20:47.579 --> 20:49.206
did they get from him?

20:54.461 --> 20:57.756
-Get me the police investigation records.
-As you wish.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.182
Excuse me.

21:07.266 --> 21:11.019
I've been waiting for you, Tokizawa.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.438
Having you participate would put me at ease.

21:14.773 --> 21:15.816
Give me a moment.

21:17.109 --> 21:19.736
I'm writing an important letter right now.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.781
It's not a love letter, okay?

21:28.245 --> 21:32.332
I have a report about the corpses of those
mafia guys found in the warehouse.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.503
Hold on.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.840
Let the police deal with those thugs.

21:39.923 --> 21:41.174
COMMANDER
SANEATSU NEKOMA

21:41.258 --> 21:43.927
Our hands are full
with the case of the Demon's Curse.

21:44.011 --> 21:45.429
According to the witnesses,

21:45.512 --> 21:49.808
one man in a black tuxedo
killed all twelve by himself.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.272
By himself?

21:57.983 --> 21:59.026
I found this.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.868
Please look at this.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.377
Could it be?

22:18.211 --> 22:21.381
He's a watchdog of the Queen of the West.

22:24.343 --> 22:28.055
He carries out assassinations
and investigations at the Queen's orders.

22:29.389 --> 22:33.435
They do anything it takes,
even if it means sacrificing innocent citizens.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.936
They're in our country too.

22:37.439 --> 22:41.818
But... that's just a rumor, right?

22:43.028 --> 22:47.115
If the Queen's watchdogs really do exist,
our country is in danger.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.202
We must eliminate them.

22:52.454 --> 22:55.999
I can't approve this based only on a hunch.

22:59.669 --> 23:00.504
Well, then...

23:02.047 --> 23:03.715
Pretend you never heard anything.

23:06.426 --> 23:07.427
Excuse me.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.516
You're right. I haven't heard anything.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.937
But, you know, Tokizawa...

23:19.231 --> 23:21.191
if you're going to eliminate a watchdog...

23:22.567 --> 23:24.986
make sure its owner doesn't find out who did it.

23:48.802 --> 23:54.307
So the sales of children's toys this term,
expected to rise by 5 percent

23:54.391 --> 23:58.687
thanks to the overwhelming success
of our Bitter Rabbit product.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.063
Thank you.

24:01.815 --> 24:04.526
This concludes the director's meeting.

24:18.665 --> 24:22.002
Are you ignoring work because
you're having fun playing house?

24:24.838 --> 24:26.339
Excuse me.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.384
Did you find out anything?

24:34.181 --> 24:38.476
If there's anything I can do to help,
let me know, Kiyoharu.

24:39.936 --> 24:41.938
Thank you.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.190
Auntie.

24:46.568 --> 24:51.198
A long time ago, an aristocrat from the West,
Earl Ernest Phantomhive,

24:51.281 --> 24:54.618
said he was from the Genpo family,
and settled in our country permanently.

24:56.703 --> 25:01.082
The Genpo family had amassed a fortune
through manufacturing and selling toys.

25:02.751 --> 25:06.296
Their business continued to expand.

25:06.379 --> 25:10.634
However, their third family head,
Arihito Genpo, and his wife Erika,

25:10.717 --> 25:14.554
were unexpectedly shot and killed.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.807
-Shot?
-Yes.

25:17.891 --> 25:22.604
Shiori, their only daughter,
has been missing ever since.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.690
A few weeks after the incident,

25:25.774 --> 25:28.902
<i>a child named Kiyoharu,</i>
<i>who said he was Arihito's secret child,</i>

25:28.985 --> 25:32.322
<i>appeared with the man in the tuxedo.</i>

25:32.405 --> 25:36.243
<i>Kiyoharu inherited the family business.</i>

25:38.745 --> 25:42.249
How did a kid like him inherit the business?

25:42.332 --> 25:44.542
The Genpo family has a rule

25:44.626 --> 25:49.381
where only male children can inherit
the position of head of the family.

25:49.464 --> 25:52.842
At first, some people were suspicious
of Kiyoharu.

25:52.926 --> 25:56.429
However, the DNA tests came back positive.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.474
Erika's only relative,
her sister Hanae Wakatsuki,

25:59.557 --> 26:01.726
supported Kiyoharu as the successor.

26:01.810 --> 26:06.815
The Genpo family business has grown bigger
under their joint management.

26:06.898 --> 26:12.279
People's concerns were assuaged,
and Kiyoharu inherited the position of Earl.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.366
Aristocrats of darkness...

26:26.543 --> 26:28.712
I lost again.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.757
He died in an alley in a slum,
in the morning.

26:32.841 --> 26:37.095
According to the witnesses,
he was mummified in an instant.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.514
No one knows what he was doing,

26:39.597 --> 26:42.726
or where he was before he died.

26:48.732 --> 26:51.109
Our police investigated it.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.119
How do you always
get a hold of things like this?

27:02.704 --> 27:06.541
The Queen's watchdog has his own dog too.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.384
Please continue the investigation
of Anthony Campbell.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.514
I'm counting on you,
fourth head of the Genpo family.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.152
Why do you like cats so much?

27:34.235 --> 27:36.613
They're the only ones I can talk to.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.699
Let's go.

27:39.783 --> 27:43.411
Which car would you like to take today?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.496
A small one.

27:55.173 --> 27:59.928
Anthony's body will be sent back home
on today's flight.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.472
We're heading to the location
we agreed upon now.

28:02.555 --> 28:07.143
We'll probably be able to buy
about five minutes.

28:10.063 --> 28:10.980
That's enough.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.023
It's been some time, Earl.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.191
I've been waiting.

28:57.485 --> 29:03.158
But how did you find out
I was transporting the body?

29:03.241 --> 29:04.993
I didn't find out.

29:05.076 --> 29:08.872
I forged the data for the order
so that you'd be the one transporting it.

29:12.459 --> 29:16.004
If you're the one doing it,
all I have to do is bribe you.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.309
Out of my way.

29:31.186 --> 29:33.855
I got it. Five minutes, okay?

30:11.392 --> 30:13.645
It's a piece of a cigar.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.943
A Cuban cigar. That's rare these days.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.739
That's all the proof we can find?

30:25.949 --> 30:26.950
Time's up.

30:28.535 --> 30:29.369
Young master.

30:30.495 --> 30:33.414
You're forgetting this.

30:49.514 --> 30:54.060
How did you know there was a wine stain
on the handkerchief without seeing it?

30:56.354 --> 31:01.025
<i>The fact that there were pieces of the cigar</i>
<i>between his teeth</i>

31:01.109 --> 31:05.113
<i>means that he bit it</i>
<i>instead of using a cigar cutter.</i>

31:05.196 --> 31:09.534
<i>However, from the looks of his shoes</i>
<i>and his nice suit,</i>

31:09.617 --> 31:12.537
<i>that man's quite the gentleman.</i>

31:12.620 --> 31:18.126
<i>He must have been quite drunk</i>
<i>to do something like that.</i>

31:19.502 --> 31:24.716
That's why I was able to predict
that he must have wiped his mouth,

31:24.799 --> 31:28.052
once or twice.

31:28.136 --> 31:32.515
You like playing detective
even though you're just a demon.

31:32.599 --> 31:37.562
A butler in the Genpo family
must at the very least be able to do so.

31:37.645 --> 31:42.317
I thought you noticed it as well, young master.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.402
Damn butler.

31:44.485 --> 31:47.363
You even know the brand of wine, correct?

31:48.698 --> 31:52.327
It's 1975 Chateau Bonheur.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.288
Find the distribution channels
for the cigar and the wine.

31:55.371 --> 31:56.664
They're both important brands.

32:01.210 --> 32:02.045
As you wish.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.260
A high-end club?

32:10.511 --> 32:13.640
On the surface, it looks like an ordinary club.

32:14.974 --> 32:18.353
<i>However, there's an area underground</i>
<i>that only certain members can enter.</i>

32:19.812 --> 32:24.067
<i>A secret gathering was held there.</i>

32:32.992 --> 32:35.662
<i>I looked up all the distribution channels.</i>

32:35.745 --> 32:41.000
<i>That is the only place where you can get</i>
<i>both that cigar and that wine.</i>

32:42.210 --> 32:46.214
So that's where Anthony was
before he was mummified?

32:46.297 --> 32:47.298
Probably.

32:52.845 --> 32:53.972
I see.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.185
<i>That's what's in that envelope.</i>

32:59.268 --> 33:01.437
<i>An invitation to that party.</i>

33:02.897 --> 33:05.400
-Get me the invitation list.
-It's right here.

33:07.694 --> 33:11.280
You'll need an introduction to get in.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.208
I bet my aunt knows some of the people here.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.294
Maybe it'll work out if I ask her.

33:26.546 --> 33:30.675
-Let's talk about it tomorrow.
-Well, then I shall contact Hanae at once.

33:34.762 --> 33:38.516
I don't really want to meet her
outside the boardroom.

33:40.268 --> 33:43.688
Your shyness is almost pathological.

33:45.481 --> 33:49.610
As the head of the Genpo family,
you should interact with her with confidence.

33:52.655 --> 33:56.993
Hey. Do something about that long face first.
You're being rude to Eri.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.164
Act like you're having fun, even if it's a lie.

34:03.416 --> 34:05.209
Okay? Laugh!

34:05.293 --> 34:08.463
Let go of me! I'm--

34:11.132 --> 34:12.258
Ever since that day...

34:14.010 --> 34:16.512
I can't remember how to smile.

34:54.383 --> 34:55.301
Sorry.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.369
This food is wonderful, Sebastian.

35:53.860 --> 35:57.321
I understand.
You want me to get you an invitation.

35:59.282 --> 36:02.243
Sorry to ask you for so much.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.122
What are you trying to investigate?

36:12.211 --> 36:14.672
You never tell me the important part.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.761
Your mother was also my older sister.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.683
I want to get revenge too.

36:29.061 --> 36:31.314
So I'm going to help you.

36:31.397 --> 36:33.107
I won't ask any questions.

36:41.657 --> 36:42.491
Auntie!

36:42.575 --> 36:44.076
Takashi! Please.

37:11.270 --> 37:13.397
Leave it to me.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.066
I shall get revenge.

37:22.698 --> 37:25.743
I know some of these people. It'll be fine.

37:27.245 --> 37:33.125
But I heard you'll need an escort
to enter the venue.

37:34.585 --> 37:35.920
Do you know anyone?

37:56.065 --> 37:57.692
Sorry!

38:02.738 --> 38:05.574
I'm sorry our servant has troubled you.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.663
That was amazing.

38:10.746 --> 38:13.582
You know how to do everything.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.127
You're right. He's all-powerful.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.338
But I'm the king.

38:20.548 --> 38:25.344
I've trained him not to follow anyone's orders
except mine.

38:25.803 --> 38:26.846
As you wish.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.663
Not bad.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.499
Don't stare at me like that.

38:59.795 --> 39:03.299
Rin, be very, very careful...

39:03.382 --> 39:04.925
not to do anything careless.

39:06.093 --> 39:07.678
Yes.

39:07.762 --> 39:08.888
Here's the invitation.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.683
Be careful.

39:20.441 --> 39:21.317
What's wrong?

39:24.737 --> 39:26.113
<i>This seal...</i>

39:30.826 --> 39:33.662
<i>When my father and mother were killed...</i>

39:39.460 --> 39:41.087
Kiyoharu?

39:41.170 --> 39:43.589
Auntie, who's organizing the party?

39:43.672 --> 39:46.550
The president of Epsilon Pharmaceuticals,
Shinpei Kujo.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.844
He's in charge of new drug development.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.972
Let's go, Rin.

39:52.056 --> 39:52.890
Okay.

39:54.308 --> 39:57.937
-Investigate Epsilon Pharmaceuticals' factory.
-As you wish.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.554
Where are we?

40:31.637 --> 40:37.560
<i>Embassy staff, politicians,</i>
<i>and CEOs from around the world.</i>

40:37.643 --> 40:39.687
<i>What's going on in this club?</i>

40:43.524 --> 40:48.154
<i>Shinozaki. He's a weapons dealer</i>
<i>with connections to the underworld.</i>

40:48.237 --> 40:51.282
<i>Rumors are that he deals with</i>
<i>terrorist organizations too.</i>

41:00.166 --> 41:05.546
Welcome, everyone.
Thank you for coming today.

41:07.173 --> 41:12.887
Let me introduce myself, the host of this party.
I'm Shinpei Kujo.

41:14.096 --> 41:19.810
Please enjoy yourselves tonight.

41:36.243 --> 41:37.286
Stay here.

41:58.891 --> 41:59.850
Young master.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.438
Rin! I told you to stay there!

42:04.522 --> 42:06.482
Sorry.

42:06.565 --> 42:10.277
But I was told not to leave you alone.

42:10.361 --> 42:11.779
It's okay. Just go back.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.572
What's wrong?

42:17.159 --> 42:19.578
I'm so pleased to meet you.

42:19.662 --> 42:24.500
I wanted to introduce myself, so I followed you.

42:24.583 --> 42:27.503
You're Shinpei Kujo, right?

42:27.586 --> 42:30.297
Yes. That's right.

42:31.048 --> 42:32.466
Nice to meet you. I'm--

42:32.550 --> 42:34.093
I know.

42:35.636 --> 42:40.975
You're the charismatic young president
of Funtom, right?

42:41.058 --> 42:41.892
Thank you.

42:41.976 --> 42:43.435
And...

42:45.854 --> 42:47.731
you're one of the Queen's dogs.

42:53.612 --> 42:55.114
What are you doing!?

43:01.328 --> 43:02.830
You bastard!

43:02.913 --> 43:05.583
What a pathetic howl.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.489
What have I done?

46:50.265 --> 46:53.227
I see. So, this is it.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.578
I found you.

47:34.851 --> 47:36.186
Take a look.

47:37.604 --> 47:42.901
The time has finally come
for me to show you the results of my research.

47:42.985 --> 47:46.113
<i>Kujo and Shinozaki?</i>

47:51.201 --> 47:57.165
They're addicted to the illegal drug
I developed.

48:01.211 --> 48:06.883
<i>I invited them this secret party</i>
<i>to sample my new drugs.</i>

48:06.967 --> 48:09.553
<i>They were happy to consume them.</i>

48:26.236 --> 48:29.865
<i>Let's use them as guinea pigs.</i>

48:30.532 --> 48:33.910
I'm going to give you
the best show in the world.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.581
<i>Well then, everyone.</i>

48:37.664 --> 48:43.337
<i>I will now distribute my new drug.</i>

48:53.430 --> 48:56.642
This is the ultimate drug,

48:56.725 --> 49:00.771
developed after years of research.

49:02.189 --> 49:05.734
<i>It's called "Necrosis."</i>

49:13.700 --> 49:15.661
<i>Don't be hasty.</i>

49:15.744 --> 49:20.707
<i>This is how you enjoy Necrosis.</i>

49:23.960 --> 49:27.964
<i>The liquid leaking from this capsule</i>
<i>will evaporate</i>

49:28.048 --> 49:32.260
<i>and infuse the drug into the air.</i>

49:33.470 --> 49:39.685
<i>Breathing that air</i>
<i>is enough to send you to heaven.</i>

49:59.121 --> 50:03.834
<i>How does it feel</i>
<i>to ascend the stairs to heaven?</i>

50:03.917 --> 50:07.003
<i>It is far more stimulating than any other drug.</i>

50:10.674 --> 50:14.886
<i>That's right. As you all know,</i>

50:14.970 --> 50:21.393
this drug is the secret behind
the Demon's Curse.

50:23.562 --> 50:27.941
<i>First, you'll bleed from your nose,</i>
<i>and next from your ears.</i>

50:28.024 --> 50:30.569
<i>Finally, you'll bleed from your eyes.</i>

50:30.652 --> 50:34.239
<i>After your heartbeat reaches its maximum limit</i>

50:34.322 --> 50:37.159
you'll immediately be mummified.

50:38.827 --> 50:41.913
<i>After it leaks from the capsule,</i>

50:41.997 --> 50:47.461
<i>the drug's effect will be active</i>
<i>for approximately 15 minutes.</i>

50:47.544 --> 50:53.049
<i>There's only one way to save yourself.</i>

50:56.553 --> 51:00.974
<i>It's the antidote for Necrosis.</i>

51:02.434 --> 51:07.939
However, if you take only one capsule,
it will save your life,

51:08.023 --> 51:12.027
but you'll be left with brain damage.

51:12.110 --> 51:18.992
To survive with your health intact,
you must consume at least two.

51:24.414 --> 51:30.378
Once you start bleeding from your eyes,
it's a sign that you're almost in heaven!

51:30.462 --> 51:32.005
<i>Hurry!</i>

51:42.849 --> 51:48.438
Humans aren't capable of understanding
each other's pain.

51:48.522 --> 51:53.944
They choose their own survival,
even if it means trampling over others.

51:54.027 --> 52:00.242
Have a look.
It's an embodiment of how the world works.

52:01.743 --> 52:05.664
Our experiment has produced excellent results.

52:06.706 --> 52:12.879
With Necrosis and its antidote,
we can rule over the world through fear.

52:15.715 --> 52:20.679
This is the chemical equation for producing it.

52:31.815 --> 52:35.068
What? Is this a joke?

53:00.510 --> 53:05.390
Young master! Young master!
Are you okay, young master?

53:06.641 --> 53:09.311
Young master! Young master!

53:15.901 --> 53:17.110
Young master!

53:17.193 --> 53:18.653
Rin, calm down!

53:23.742 --> 53:24.701
Let's go.

53:29.664 --> 53:33.752
If the glass breaks, we're in trouble.
Hold your breath.

53:33.835 --> 53:35.211
Hurry!

53:43.678 --> 53:45.347
That bastard!

53:47.974 --> 53:52.270
Quit fooling around!
We're going home. Call Sato.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.396
As you wish.

53:55.649 --> 53:59.402
The Demon's Curse is actually a drug
called Necrosis.

54:00.278 --> 54:01.655
A drug?

54:02.864 --> 54:08.203
<i>Kujo probably gave him a cigar</i>
<i>doped with Necrosis when he left the club.</i>

54:10.288 --> 54:14.376
<i>He also secretly planted a demon card on him.</i>

54:18.004 --> 54:21.633
<i>The target inhaled the Necrosis</i>
<i>through the cigar.</i>

54:41.152 --> 54:42.862
No! No!

55:01.381 --> 55:04.509
<i>And breathed his last breath in despair.</i>

55:04.592 --> 55:09.347
<i>That's how the demon card</i>
<i>was made to appear with the mummy.</i>

55:12.225 --> 55:14.602
So Kujo is the mastermind?

55:14.686 --> 55:17.731
No. He was killed.

55:18.773 --> 55:20.775
He was being used by the weapons dealer.

55:25.739 --> 55:30.994
Shinozaki placed an order for Necrosis
and killed Kujo.

55:32.287 --> 55:35.415
So the weapons dealer was behind all of this.

55:35.498 --> 55:39.711
They have plenty of money and technology,
but no sense of danger.

55:39.794 --> 55:42.213
That's why this country was deceived.

55:44.215 --> 55:48.887
Don't worry. I'm going to see Shinozaki now.
Get ready.

55:48.970 --> 55:49.846
As you wish.

55:51.890 --> 55:53.016
Young master!

55:54.309 --> 55:55.393
What?

55:55.477 --> 55:58.980
The police want to speak with you
and Sebastian.

56:05.487 --> 56:09.407
There will be an exorcism today
attended by the world's leaders.

56:09.491 --> 56:11.493
Please avoid causing any trouble.

56:14.537 --> 56:15.789
It can't be helped.

56:16.915 --> 56:18.666
Go.

56:18.750 --> 56:20.543
Play the part.

56:21.628 --> 56:22.629
As you wish.

56:43.024 --> 56:46.653
There are always exceptions.

56:47.779 --> 56:52.992
This is one place within the police
where exceptions are accepted.

57:02.669 --> 57:05.713
<i>Something's wrong. No one's here.</i>

57:12.595 --> 57:15.390
I'm going to step out for a moment.

57:16.558 --> 57:21.396
In the meantime,
these three are going to take care of you

57:23.064 --> 57:24.149
Do whatever you want.

57:27.152 --> 57:28.486
Enjoy.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.917
You won't be so relaxed in a moment.

57:45.211 --> 57:49.924
You're going to miss me.
I won't be back soon.

57:51.968 --> 57:53.136
Be ready.

58:07.317 --> 58:08.818
Well, then...

58:12.614 --> 58:14.991
Let's begin the interrogation.

58:15.074 --> 58:16.284
Interrogation?

58:18.912 --> 58:22.332
Oh, sorry.

58:22.415 --> 58:26.294
I don't have time to participate.

58:26.377 --> 58:27.629
What?

59:05.833 --> 59:06.709
Hurry up!

59:16.094 --> 59:18.846
<i>They're killing them on top of a tarp.</i>

59:18.930 --> 59:21.849
<i>They don't want to leave</i>
<i>any trace of the killings.</i>

59:37.156 --> 59:40.660
I played the part, master.

1:00:01.848 --> 1:00:02.932
Young master.

1:00:04.350 --> 1:00:06.603
Rin! What are you doing?

1:00:07.687 --> 1:00:11.316
I was told not to leave you alone.

1:00:12.984 --> 1:00:14.736
Not again!

1:00:30.209 --> 1:00:31.294
Rin!

1:00:34.756 --> 1:00:37.091
<i>They're going to kill me</i>
<i>as soon as I'm on the tarp.</i>

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:42.180
Young master!

1:00:44.557 --> 1:00:46.059
<i>Shinozaki?</i>

1:00:46.934 --> 1:00:49.854
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>I thought he was the mastermind.</i>

1:00:52.607 --> 1:00:54.025
<i>I see.</i>

1:00:54.901 --> 1:00:57.195
<i>That was a suspicion of mine from the start.</i>

1:00:57.278 --> 1:01:00.239
<i>The criminal always left a demon card</i>
<i>at the scene.</i>

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:01.991
<i>Like he wanted to stand out.</i>

1:01:02.075 --> 1:01:06.120
<i>If all they wanted to do was develop drugs,</i>
<i>they wouldn't have done that.</i>

1:01:08.289 --> 1:01:10.917
<i>They did it specifically to draw attention.</i>

1:01:12.794 --> 1:01:18.341
<i>I had a feeling I wasn't going to be killed</i>
<i>back there.</i>

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:23.971
<i>They let me live so that I would tell the Queen</i>
<i>Shinozaki was behind this.</i>

1:01:25.556 --> 1:01:26.724
<i>If that's the case,</i>

1:01:26.808 --> 1:01:31.437
<i>the mastermind must be planning</i>
<i>on using the Necrosis in an act of terrorism.</i>

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:35.650
<i>The target would be something</i>
<i>all the world has its eyes on.</i>

1:01:35.733 --> 1:01:39.028
There will be an exorcism today
attended by the world's leaders.

1:01:47.578 --> 1:01:54.585
<i>There's no better place to demonstrate</i>
<i>the power of Necrosis than the exorcism.</i>

1:01:55.837 --> 1:02:00.508
<i>If people disappear from this building</i>
<i>or appear to have gone missing,</i>

1:02:00.591 --> 1:02:03.344
<i>everyone would suspect Shinozaki did it.</i>

1:02:05.972 --> 1:02:10.435
<i>Rumors are that Shinozaki's company</i>
<i>does business with terrorist organizations.</i>

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:14.981
<i>People would conclude that a terrorist</i>
<i>organization had acquired the Necrosis.</i>

1:02:15.064 --> 1:02:17.900
<i>The world would fall into a panic.</i>

1:02:21.028 --> 1:02:23.448
<i>He's the perfect scapegoat.</i>

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:30.913
Young master! Stop!

1:03:15.750 --> 1:03:16.584
Sorry.

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:27.595
Idiot!

1:03:28.471 --> 1:03:29.305
Rin.

1:03:33.851 --> 1:03:36.854
I'll draw their attention. You escape.

1:03:36.938 --> 1:03:38.022
What?

1:03:39.982 --> 1:03:45.238
I was raised to protect the Genpo family.

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:50.618
That's what my family has done
for many generations.

1:03:52.745 --> 1:03:56.207
Don't worry. Just go.

1:03:58.584 --> 1:04:00.169
Miss Shiori.

1:04:03.464 --> 1:04:04.715
You...

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:19.730
<i>I wasn't able to protect the master and his wife.</i>

1:04:19.814 --> 1:04:21.357
<i>You went missing too.</i>

1:04:23.067 --> 1:04:24.819
<i>I wanted to die.</i>

1:04:31.576 --> 1:04:34.745
<i>But you returned...</i>

1:04:36.497 --> 1:04:40.042
<i>to take over their work</i>
<i>as the Queen's watchdogs.</i>

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:41.502
<i>Dressed like a boy.</i>

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:54.557
I can't cook or clean,
but you still let me work for you.

1:04:56.058 --> 1:05:00.229
I finally have the chance to repay you.

1:05:08.946 --> 1:05:10.406
Thanks for taking care of me.

1:05:14.869 --> 1:05:15.703
Hurry!

1:06:41.372 --> 1:06:43.666
It's customary for anyone
who serves an aristocrat.

1:06:45.126 --> 1:06:46.669
I'm ready.

1:07:01.726 --> 1:07:03.269
Sebastian!

1:07:04.645 --> 1:07:05.980
What are you doing here?

1:07:18.492 --> 1:07:19.326
Hurry!

1:07:26.292 --> 1:07:27.334
Young master!

1:07:32.089 --> 1:07:33.591
-Auntie!
-Kiyoharu!

1:07:33.674 --> 1:07:35.551
We've got to hurry to the exorcism!

1:07:35.634 --> 1:07:36.761
The exorcism?

1:07:39.055 --> 1:07:41.766
Save my family's dear servant.

1:07:41.849 --> 1:07:44.894
When you're done,
come to the exorcism immediately.

1:07:44.977 --> 1:07:46.520
Play the part.

1:07:49.106 --> 1:07:53.235
He told me to "save my family's dear servant."

1:07:54.653 --> 1:07:56.572
Those words are wasted on me.

1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:02.453
Well, then.

1:08:05.581 --> 1:08:07.750
You're ready, right?

1:08:18.010 --> 1:08:21.388
<i>The special prayer ceremony</i>
<i>at King's West Cathedral</i>

1:08:21.472 --> 1:08:23.974
<i>has been underway since last evening.</i>

1:08:24.058 --> 1:08:27.978
<i>The representatives of international</i>
<i>organizations from all over the world</i>

1:08:28.062 --> 1:08:31.816
<i>have been praying with the locals</i>
<i>under heavy security protection</i>

1:08:31.899 --> 1:08:33.317
<i>all through the night.</i>

1:08:41.033 --> 1:08:47.873
For you have delivered my soul from death
and prevented my feet from falling.

1:08:47.957 --> 1:08:53.587
That may I walk before God
in the light of the living.

1:08:54.505 --> 1:09:00.136
<i>Be merciful to me, oh God. Be merciful to me,</i>

1:09:00.219 --> 1:09:02.972
<i>for my soul takes refuge in you.</i>

1:09:06.559 --> 1:09:07.977
Are we going the wrong way?

1:09:09.311 --> 1:09:12.064
No. This is right.

1:09:24.702 --> 1:09:27.913
<i>I cry out to God most high,</i>

1:09:27.997 --> 1:09:33.085
<i>to God who accomplishes my requests for me.</i>

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:39.300
<i>He will send from heaven and save me.</i>
<i>He rebukes the one who is pursuing me.</i>

1:09:40.301 --> 1:09:44.305
<i>God will send out his loving kindness</i>
<i>and his truth.</i>

1:09:52.521 --> 1:09:58.485
<i>My soul is among the lions,</i>
<i>and I lie among those who are set on fire.</i>

1:09:58.569 --> 1:10:04.116
<i>Even the sons of men,</i>
<i>whose teeth are spears and arrows...</i>

1:10:21.759 --> 1:10:23.302
<i>A detonator?</i>

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:32.311
Have you ever seen it up close yourself?

1:10:39.318 --> 1:10:40.444
What's this?

1:10:42.196 --> 1:10:44.198
That's right. It's Necrosis.

1:10:46.075 --> 1:10:49.995
You were blindfolded,
so I suppose you couldn't see it well.

1:11:06.053 --> 1:11:07.346
What are you doing?

1:11:13.352 --> 1:11:18.607
In 30 minutes, anyone within
a 1 kilometer radius will be mummified.

1:11:18.691 --> 1:11:22.653
This act of terrorism
will change the entire world.

1:11:22.736 --> 1:11:24.697
In that moment, this photo will be released.

1:11:26.198 --> 1:11:32.663
Since you interfered at the scene of the crime,
I can't frame Shinozaki anymore.

1:11:32.746 --> 1:11:36.417
So I changed the story.
Now I'm going to blame it on the Queen.

1:11:40.296 --> 1:11:41.839
You bitch!

1:11:48.053 --> 1:11:52.016
That's right. Your eye reminds me.

1:11:52.099 --> 1:11:57.771
Sebastian should be saving Rin
and heading to the exorcism now.

1:11:58.647 --> 1:12:03.068
He's trained not to do anything
unless you ordered it, right?

1:12:04.278 --> 1:12:06.947
That demon.

1:12:11.368 --> 1:12:12.745
I know about it.

1:12:14.246 --> 1:12:18.000
You sold your soul to the demon
who made a pact...

1:12:19.126 --> 1:12:20.836
with the Genpo family, right?

1:12:25.257 --> 1:12:26.258
But...

1:12:27.760 --> 1:12:30.512
if I kill you, there's nothing else to be afraid of.

1:14:20.831 --> 1:14:24.877
<i>My father and mother were killed.</i>

1:14:26.170 --> 1:14:28.380
<i>I lost everything that day.</i>

1:14:32.176 --> 1:14:34.970
<i>That is why...</i>

1:14:35.971 --> 1:14:37.055
<i>I sold my soul...</i>

1:14:38.682 --> 1:14:40.350
<i>to the demon.</i>

1:14:47.774 --> 1:14:49.735
<i>To have my revenge.</i>

1:15:10.923 --> 1:15:13.425
I can't die!

1:15:13.509 --> 1:15:15.302
Watch your manners!

1:15:19.306 --> 1:15:22.059
I can see why you sold your soul to a demon.

1:15:23.519 --> 1:15:27.648
But sometimes, your will isn't enough.

1:15:50.295 --> 1:15:52.881
Were you looking...

1:15:53.924 --> 1:15:54.841
for this?

1:15:55.592 --> 1:15:57.636
I'll give it back to you.

1:16:02.808 --> 1:16:04.184
Sebastian.

1:16:09.314 --> 1:16:10.983
How did you find us?

1:16:13.902 --> 1:16:16.280
Save my family's dear servant.

1:16:16.363 --> 1:16:19.866
When you're done,
come to the exorcism immediately.

1:16:19.950 --> 1:16:21.451
Play the part.

1:16:22.411 --> 1:16:25.122
<i>The real meaning behind "play the part"</i>

1:16:25.205 --> 1:16:29.042
<i>was to do what I needed to do</i>
<i>to save my master.</i>

1:16:30.335 --> 1:16:33.630
<i>So I didn't go to the exorcism.</i>

1:16:33.714 --> 1:16:36.758
<i>I found this location through my own network.</i>

1:16:41.138 --> 1:16:43.223
I see.

1:16:45.267 --> 1:16:49.062
I've always been suspicious of you.

1:16:53.233 --> 1:16:58.113
I saw the documents
in Epsilon Pharmaceuticals' lab.

1:17:00.365 --> 1:17:02.034
<i>The Elixir of Life from the West.</i>

1:17:02.117 --> 1:17:03.368
<i>Amrita from India.</i>

1:17:03.452 --> 1:17:06.747
<i>Xu Fu, who was ordered by Qin Shi Huang</i>
<i>to search for an elixir.</i>

1:17:06.830 --> 1:17:11.627
<i>The legend that says eating a goldfish</i>
<i>will make you immortal.</i>

1:17:11.710 --> 1:17:14.921
<i>Everything was related to immortality.</i>

1:17:15.005 --> 1:17:18.925
In other words,
Kujo was researching the elixir of life.

1:17:20.802 --> 1:17:23.805
<i>That white drug I took at the lab...</i>

1:17:25.015 --> 1:17:29.519
<i>was the exact same drug you were taking.</i>

1:17:32.439 --> 1:17:34.149
Sorry!

1:17:34.232 --> 1:17:36.485
<i>It's not the elixir of life.</i>

1:17:37.736 --> 1:17:42.783
But it preserves youth,
so it might also be effective for extending life.

1:17:43.950 --> 1:17:46.495
Then what about Necrosis?

1:17:48.413 --> 1:17:50.832
It's probably a byproduct
of producing that drug.

1:17:52.542 --> 1:17:58.507
<i>Kujo originally began developing an elixir of life</i>
<i>at Hanae's request.</i>

1:17:58.590 --> 1:18:03.929
<i>It started long before the young master's</i>
<i>parents were murdered.</i>

1:18:04.012 --> 1:18:09.976
<i>The research showed that the key ingredients</i>
<i>are enzymes and hormones</i>

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:13.814
<i>extracted from girls while they're still alive.</i>

1:18:16.441 --> 1:18:19.152
<i>While searching for the optimal formula,</i>

1:18:19.236 --> 1:18:25.826
<i>they stumbled upon a chemical</i>
<i>that drastically increased cell growth rate.</i>

1:18:29.079 --> 1:18:30.122
<i>That...</i>

1:18:31.123 --> 1:18:33.667
<i>is what the Demon's Curse really is.</i>

1:18:36.962 --> 1:18:42.008
Then those girls in the warehouse
were used to make the drug?

1:18:47.097 --> 1:18:49.641
It's all because of the traditions
of this cursed family.

1:18:52.227 --> 1:18:56.481
I was once your father's wife.
Did you know that?

1:19:02.487 --> 1:19:05.907
<i>The head of the Genpo family,</i>
<i>who inherited the role of the watchdog,</i>

1:19:05.991 --> 1:19:10.036
<i>was supposed to choose one of us</i>
<i>to be his wife.</i>

1:19:15.792 --> 1:19:17.294
<i>I was the one...</i>

1:19:19.546 --> 1:19:20.672
<i>he chose.</i>

1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:30.348
<i>I was so happy.</i>

1:19:32.142 --> 1:19:35.896
But the family had a bloody past.

1:19:37.314 --> 1:19:41.693
One day, there was an attack
targeting the Genpo family.

1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:45.739
<i>Me and my unborn child...</i>

1:19:47.324 --> 1:19:49.117
<i>were the victims.</i>

1:19:52.788 --> 1:19:55.916
I was never able to have children again.

1:19:58.335 --> 1:20:01.546
A wife who can't bear a successor
is soon cast aside.

1:20:03.673 --> 1:20:08.053
Your mother replaced me as his wife.

1:20:11.223 --> 1:20:12.307
You're lying!

1:20:14.935 --> 1:20:18.480
How could he choose tradition over me?

1:20:20.440 --> 1:20:23.652
You even dressed up like a boy.

1:20:24.986 --> 1:20:26.655
My father would never do that!

1:20:26.738 --> 1:20:30.659
I feel like I'm having a heart attack
when I remember how happy he looked.

1:20:46.132 --> 1:20:49.010
That's why I came up with the idea.

1:20:49.094 --> 1:20:51.263
If I can't have children,

1:20:51.346 --> 1:20:56.226
then I'll make my body immortal.

1:20:56.309 --> 1:20:57.602
And then...

1:20:58.728 --> 1:21:03.191
when everyone bound to those stupid
traditions die, I'll become the head!

1:21:20.417 --> 1:21:22.836
Now, you know everyone was lying to you.

1:21:24.129 --> 1:21:27.215
My goal is to have eternal life.

1:21:28.884 --> 1:21:32.929
When I take this drug, those attacks stop.

1:21:34.848 --> 1:21:37.142
It's so ironic.

1:21:50.363 --> 1:21:51.948
You...

1:21:54.534 --> 1:21:56.369
should never have been born!

1:22:01.917 --> 1:22:03.543
Humans.

1:22:04.628 --> 1:22:08.423
They're so entertaining.

1:22:09.549 --> 1:22:12.677
Did you kill my father and mother?

1:22:21.311 --> 1:22:24.481
That's right. They were in the way.

1:24:01.036 --> 1:24:02.287
Kill her!

1:24:04.164 --> 1:24:05.373
As you wish.

1:24:17.385 --> 1:24:18.678
Sebastian!

1:24:20.638 --> 1:24:25.143
His strength has been enhanced with drugs.
He's a work of art.

1:24:34.527 --> 1:24:38.406
I wonder if a demon
is any match for a miracle of God?

1:25:26.663 --> 1:25:31.543
I've heard that a vampire can be killed
with a silver stake.

1:25:34.003 --> 1:25:38.842
What do you think? How do you like the taste
of a sword made of silver?

1:25:42.470 --> 1:25:44.472
Don't mistake me...

1:25:46.599 --> 1:25:48.726
for a vulgar species like them.

1:27:02.258 --> 1:27:03.384
Are you sure about that?

1:27:06.179 --> 1:27:09.557
If I kill her, you won't get her soul.

1:27:56.479 --> 1:27:59.148
I wonder if a demon can die.

1:28:32.056 --> 1:28:34.434
You're so stupid. What about the antidote?

1:28:38.229 --> 1:28:39.063
It's gone!

1:28:42.358 --> 1:28:43.276
Did you--?

1:28:48.865 --> 1:28:51.743
I'll give it back to you.

1:29:17.393 --> 1:29:19.270
Looks like the tables have turned.

1:29:32.241 --> 1:29:33.451
Akashi!

1:29:36.621 --> 1:29:39.290
Are you looking for this?

1:30:02.772 --> 1:30:07.944
I have sticky fingers, just like my master.

1:30:20.915 --> 1:30:22.834
No!

1:30:42.895 --> 1:30:45.606
That was your chance to kill me just now.

1:31:39.202 --> 1:31:42.121
Help! There's some antidote in my safe.

1:31:45.333 --> 1:31:47.460
I got these at the drug lab.

1:31:53.507 --> 1:31:59.138
I don't need them.
You're going to eat my soul anyway.

1:32:03.226 --> 1:32:06.520
Save me! I didn't kill your family.

1:32:08.689 --> 1:32:13.903
I saw my father and mother
killed with this gun!

1:32:13.986 --> 1:32:16.280
I only guided him!

1:32:18.115 --> 1:32:20.660
Your father was a watchdog.

1:32:20.743 --> 1:32:23.204
Do you think I could have done all this myself?

1:32:26.832 --> 1:32:30.962
This is Hanae Wakatsuki.

1:32:32.129 --> 1:32:35.091
<i>While we were developing Necrosis,</i>

1:32:35.174 --> 1:32:38.594
<i>a messenger from the organization asked me</i>
<i>to help him assassinate the watchdog.</i>

1:32:38.678 --> 1:32:43.057
<i>It's a huge crime organization</i>
<i>that controls the East from the shadows.</i>

1:32:45.017 --> 1:32:48.604
The organization's boss
is the mastermind behind everything.

1:32:49.814 --> 1:32:54.568
I had no choice! If I didn't obey, then--

1:32:54.652 --> 1:32:56.487
Tell me who he is!

1:32:58.281 --> 1:32:59.740
I really don't know!

1:33:01.534 --> 1:33:04.036
It's not something they'd tell someone like me!

1:33:20.386 --> 1:33:21.846
What do you plan to do?

1:33:22.847 --> 1:33:26.225
Since my goal hasn't been accomplished,

1:33:26.309 --> 1:33:28.644
I'm going to let her live.

1:33:28.728 --> 1:33:32.356
What about the antidote?
I only have two capsules.

1:33:34.066 --> 1:33:35.026
I know.

1:33:36.944 --> 1:33:37.778
But...

1:33:38.946 --> 1:33:40.156
this is the only way.

1:34:08.267 --> 1:34:09.268
Take it.

1:34:23.074 --> 1:34:24.116
Thank you.

1:34:51.685 --> 1:34:54.355
I'm still alive! I'm still alive!

1:34:57.191 --> 1:34:59.860
You're such an idiot!

1:35:05.241 --> 1:35:08.619
Was it all a lie?

1:35:11.789 --> 1:35:14.125
Everything just now was true.

1:35:15.584 --> 1:35:18.921
I wish I could tell you who killed your parents,

1:35:19.004 --> 1:35:23.342
but I really don't know. Sorry.

1:35:52.163 --> 1:35:54.457
What did you do?

1:35:56.083 --> 1:36:00.129
A little experiment.

1:36:02.631 --> 1:36:05.176
An experiment?

1:36:05.259 --> 1:36:11.807
I wanted to see what a greedy human would do
when there were only two capsules.

1:36:11.891 --> 1:36:17.104
Unfortunately,
those capsules didn't contain the antidote.

1:36:18.397 --> 1:36:23.527
They contained Necrosis,
colored red with my blood.

1:36:26.655 --> 1:36:31.785
With only one capsule, the symptoms
wouldn't have advanced this fast.

1:36:35.372 --> 1:36:37.291
I played the part...

1:36:38.584 --> 1:36:40.169
master.

1:38:13.554 --> 1:38:17.141
We don't have any time.
They'll come for her soon.

1:38:25.441 --> 1:38:28.444
Through God, we shall do valiantly

1:38:28.527 --> 1:38:32.906
for it is he who will tread down our adversaries.

1:38:32.990 --> 1:38:36.869
<i>Hear my cry, God. Listen to my prayer.</i>

1:38:37.995 --> 1:38:39.538
<i>From the end of the earth,</i>

1:38:39.622 --> 1:38:43.709
<i>I will call to you</i>
<i>when my heart is overwhelmed.</i>

1:38:49.506 --> 1:38:50.924
What are you doing?

1:38:54.178 --> 1:38:56.889
You haven't accomplished your goal yet.

1:39:00.517 --> 1:39:01.644
I know.

1:39:02.770 --> 1:39:04.772
You aren't thinking about...

1:39:06.065 --> 1:39:09.151
saving others now,
given your current condition, are you?

1:39:24.917 --> 1:39:27.086
<i>What was the password he entered?</i>

1:39:31.048 --> 1:39:33.592
<i>Maybe it's Hanae's birthday.</i>

1:39:49.817 --> 1:39:52.277
<i>Maybe it's my father's birthday.</i>

1:40:05.457 --> 1:40:07.626
You won't be able to get revenge.

1:40:10.337 --> 1:40:14.258
Are you sure you're okay with that?

1:40:17.261 --> 1:40:20.472
Father... Mother... I'm sorry.

1:40:22.725 --> 1:40:23.642
I'm sorry.

1:40:36.238 --> 1:40:38.741
A strong tower of the enemy...

1:40:57.593 --> 1:40:58.594
Sebastian.

1:41:08.562 --> 1:41:10.022
It looks like...

1:41:11.815 --> 1:41:14.860
the master I serve is a boring person.

1:41:20.574 --> 1:41:22.659
If you choose death yourself...

1:41:24.119 --> 1:41:26.622
I have no obligation to protect you.

1:42:46.994 --> 1:42:48.620
<i>The day my father died...</i>

1:42:50.706 --> 1:42:52.624
<i>The day everything started...</i>

1:44:11.995 --> 1:44:13.747
It's game over.

1:44:23.924 --> 1:44:26.551
I never imagined you'd choose to die
to save others.

1:44:27.552 --> 1:44:30.806
But that saved me a lot of time.

1:44:32.724 --> 1:44:35.686
Now I can have your soul.

1:44:38.313 --> 1:44:39.731
So be it.

1:44:41.400 --> 1:44:43.568
This is what I chose.

1:44:44.903 --> 1:44:47.406
Are you lying to yourself
so you can act strong?

1:44:48.865 --> 1:44:54.037
You died without accomplishing your goal.
What a pitiful master.

1:44:56.498 --> 1:45:00.711
You're lying to yourself too.

1:45:05.007 --> 1:45:07.092
You wanted to see it, right?

1:45:09.428 --> 1:45:15.142
You wanted to see a human
give up his own life...

1:45:15.225 --> 1:45:17.102
to save others.

1:45:19.938 --> 1:45:23.108
You have hope for the human heart.

1:45:25.861 --> 1:45:30.782
That's why you continue to cling to this world.

1:45:34.494 --> 1:45:35.328
No.

1:45:37.122 --> 1:45:39.291
Blinded by self-interest,

1:45:39.374 --> 1:45:42.085
killing others for money
or to save their own life...

1:45:43.253 --> 1:45:45.255
that's what I know...

1:45:47.090 --> 1:45:48.550
humans are like.

1:45:53.055 --> 1:45:54.848
I heard that demons...

1:45:57.267 --> 1:45:59.561
were once angels.

1:46:02.814 --> 1:46:05.108
They were too idealistic...

1:46:06.526 --> 1:46:08.236
so they were sent to hell...

1:46:09.529 --> 1:46:11.198
and became demons.

1:46:15.744 --> 1:46:17.704
It doesn't matter.

1:47:27.732 --> 1:47:28.733
What was that?

1:47:28.817 --> 1:47:30.569
The antidote.

1:47:31.695 --> 1:47:34.573
Why? You're not obligated to save me.

1:47:34.656 --> 1:47:38.493
It wouldn't have been fun
to take your soul now.

1:47:39.744 --> 1:47:41.997
I'll eat it later,

1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:45.375
once I've soaked it in darkness

1:47:45.458 --> 1:47:47.544
and made your soul black.

1:49:02.994 --> 1:49:04.037
Danger?

1:49:10.043 --> 1:49:14.756
"This drug is the secret behind
the Demon's Curse."

1:50:19.696 --> 1:50:22.365
<i>Young master, can I ask you...</i>

1:50:24.034 --> 1:50:26.202
one thing?

1:50:27.662 --> 1:50:28.538
What is it?

1:50:31.166 --> 1:50:34.044
If I hadn't given you the antidote...

1:50:36.713 --> 1:50:39.424
what were you planning to do?

1:50:42.927 --> 1:50:44.220
I wonder why.

1:50:45.972 --> 1:50:47.849
I felt like if I told you what I did...

1:50:49.017 --> 1:50:51.353
that you'd save me.

1:50:54.439 --> 1:50:55.732
Which means that...

1:50:57.233 --> 1:50:59.861
demons aren't as two-faced as humans.

1:51:08.870 --> 1:51:13.375
Humans are treacherous, cruel, and hateful.

1:51:15.460 --> 1:51:17.837
They're more demonic than demons.

1:51:22.842 --> 1:51:24.219
I'm the same.

1:51:27.764 --> 1:51:29.682
I'm ugly inside.

1:51:36.022 --> 1:51:37.649
That's what humans are like.

1:51:41.694 --> 1:51:43.530
I'm a human, Sebastian.

1:51:49.661 --> 1:51:51.121
So I have an order for you.

1:51:55.291 --> 1:51:56.543
Don't...

1:52:00.422 --> 1:52:02.424
ever betray me.

1:52:04.300 --> 1:52:05.301
Never.

1:52:14.436 --> 1:52:15.270
As you wish.

1:52:55.018 --> 1:52:56.019
Sebastian.

1:53:00.398 --> 1:53:04.152
Stay here... until I fall asleep.

1:53:57.997 --> 1:53:58.915
I'll...

1:54:01.918 --> 1:54:03.545
stay by your side...

1:54:05.755 --> 1:54:06.881
forever, young master.

1:54:10.718 --> 1:54:12.762
<i>Until the end...</i>

1:54:14.305 --> 1:54:15.723
<i>of your life.</i>
