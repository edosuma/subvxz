13:01.360 --> 13:02.486
Well, think about this;

13:02.560 --> 13:04.483
Ziggy is practically a vegetable.

13:04.560 --> 13:05.800
I put his son underground,

13:05.880 --> 13:08.201
and you are free and clear
of that Polack forever.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.407
All right, well,

13:09.480 --> 13:11.608
you know what, like, I'm a felon.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.723
All right,
you're talking about accessory to murder.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.047
That son of a bitch broke
into my daughter's home

13:16.120 --> 13:18.805
and left a tooth under her pillow--
my tooth!

13:19.960 --> 13:21.450
Wait, you have a daughter?

13:21.520 --> 13:23.807
You say he threatened you
and the people you love,

13:23.880 --> 13:25.325
a real shame, and not my problem.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.243
But once he threatens my daughter!

Hey, Rie.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.130
I brought T.J. with me.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.250
He's really been missing you.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.844
I wanted to remind him
that you're always here, watching over us.

over on the bench for me?

I'm not sure how long Dion
was gonna keep it from me.

15:10.960 --> 15:12.405
Probably forever.

15:14.640 --> 15:15.687
And you...

15:16.720 --> 15:19.883
[scoffs] You sure as hell
wouldn't have to tell me,

15:19.960 --> 15:23.089
right? You cheat, you die...

15:24.000 --> 15:26.446
you take the betrayal
to the grave with you.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.930

15:36.320 --> 15:38.368
Well, now that the truth is out,

here's some truth for you.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.608
You know how I've been telling you how,
uh...

15:45.720 --> 15:49.122
how great T.J.'s been doing,
and that I'm fine?

15:49.640 --> 15:51.642
Well, I'm not fine, Rie.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.564
And neither is your son.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.049
He's traumatized.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.046
He hasn't spoken a word since you died.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.521
And me, I've been--
I've been holding you up

of who I thought you were.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.726
Well, what am I mourning now, huh?

16:17.880 --> 16:20.121
You destroyed all of it.

When I drop you off, you have to go
right back to class, all right?

16:38.280 --> 16:41.568
Jensen's gonna pick you up
after school and bring you to granddad's.

16:41.640 --> 16:44.723
And then later,
she'll bring you back home.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.329
So uh, so we can hang out.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.810
You know, have dinner together.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.889
Make a snack if you want,
but then get right on it, okay?

I know, buddy. I miss her, too.

[Tommy] Eighty five percent of taste
is smell. Go ahead and nose it.

17:18.319 --> 17:21.164
This is Portugal's answer
to white Burgundy, okay?

17:21.240 --> 17:24.722
Recommend it with all seafood
and it also pairs well with our cheeses.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.280
Steven, we're not drinking, we're tasting.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.722
Remember, right? Come on.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.640
All right.
Our last white is a Pinot Grigio.

uh, medium body with hints of

17:37.080 --> 17:39.162

Excuse me! Excuse me!
I'm trying to prep the staff.

- Hey.

Can I talk to you for a minute?

I guess it's not immediately obvious
that I'm in the middle of something.

I can't really go in--

18:43.600 --> 18:46.331
Whatever happened
between you and Dion must be pretty big

into a complete jerk.

So, I'm sorry for being a dick.

I might be a dick for a little while.

Well, actually, I'm glad you know.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.610
I want us to always be completely honest
with each other.

19:33.520 --> 19:35.568

19:54.280 --> 19:55.930
[Woichik] That's okay. I'll be brief.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.968
I'm opening a restaurant in Williamsburg.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.443
French, top-notch chef, one of the best.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.570
I'm so happy for you!

20:04.480 --> 20:06.289
I like the way you carry yourself.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.763
I think you'd be a fantastic maitre d'.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.686
I want to make you an offer.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.609
Oh, Patrick, that's so...

20:15.040 --> 20:18.487
honestly, my first thought is to say no,
I'm happy where I am.

20:18.560 --> 20:23.282
But the truth is I've become involved
with one of the owners of the restaurant.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.000
And that's a bad thing?

20:25.880 --> 20:29.089
Yes. Because I've lied to this man a lot

20:29.160 --> 20:31.845
ever since I met him at our grief group.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.521
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.247
Who are you grieving, if I may?

20:41.600 --> 20:42.647
No one.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.249
I'd had this string
of terrible relationships

20:49.320 --> 20:51.971
with guys who cheated on me
or walked away.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.083
So, I went to this grief group,

20:54.160 --> 20:57.050
thinking there might be men
there who could commit,

20:57.600 --> 20:59.841
'cause, obviously, they'd
committed before.

Wait, you were there to...

It sounds so crazy saying it out loud.
I...

21:07.560 --> 21:10.086
And as soon as I got there,
I met this man,

21:10.280 --> 21:13.284
and suddenly I'm telling him
I had a husband who died.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.050
And now I can't take it back.

Not unless you count bleeding

I warned you that kind of bleeding
would start eventually.

to this point, but...

Of course you're upset. I'd be upset.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.843
Now, see, that? That's bullshit.

27:41.480 --> 27:46.088
You have no idea what it's like.
You have no idea how I feel.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.162
'Cause this, this isn't something
that other guys do to Dion Patras.

27:50.680 --> 27:54.082
This is something Dion Patras
does to other guys.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.965
Even his best friend.

27:58.400 --> 28:00.926
[footsteps recede]

There's the big guy.

28:10.840 --> 28:13.411
- Buddy!
- Thanks, Jensen. Appreciate it.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.969
Hey, what's up, man? Huh?

28:17.680 --> 28:18.681
[Dion] Huh, you hungry?

28:19.360 --> 28:20.407
[Dion] No?

28:20.960 --> 28:24.203
Hey, I, uh, heard that Andre kid
got suspended, huh?

28:25.200 --> 28:26.406
Things doing better at school?

28:27.400 --> 28:29.289
[blowtorch hissing]

28:35.400 --> 28:37.482
Listen, you know,
if things are still tough,

28:37.560 --> 28:39.722
you gotta let us know so we can help,
you know?

28:40.040 --> 28:41.087
Hey, buddy.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.484
Hey, you got laundry upstairs to fold,
okay? I'll be up in a minute.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.720
Oh, hey, here.
I'll empty your lunch stuff.

28:53.320 --> 28:54.401
Don't talk to my son.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.164
Come on, man, I'm just letting
him know if things get bad--

28:57.240 --> 29:00.005
I'm just letting you know;
don't talk to my son.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.087
Ouch.

29:06.560 --> 29:07.641
What's up with him?

29:07.960 --> 29:09.689

Very good.

[glasses clang]

29:20.200 --> 29:22.806
- Uh, sorry, Tommy.
- No, it's totally my fault.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.880
Wrong wine, table 12.
They ordered the Magalousia.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.246
You mean the Malagousia.

29:28.320 --> 29:30.926
I mean maybe you should take a minute
to collect yourself.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.366
Collect myself, why?

29:32.480 --> 29:34.608
I'll take care of this. You have a stain.

29:42.920 --> 29:43.921
Is there a problem?

29:44.240 --> 29:46.004
[sighs] This wine is dumb.

29:46.200 --> 29:47.201
Dumb?

29:47.280 --> 29:49.009
It's a vintner's term, meaning--

29:49.080 --> 29:51.208
No, I know what it means,
but that's impossible.

29:51.440 --> 29:53.966
I've poured most of this case,
and it's drinking beautifully.

29:54.200 --> 29:56.646
- May I?
" [scoffs]

30:06.680 --> 30:07.727
It's perfect.

30:07.800 --> 30:12.601
Excuse me, but I know wine,
and <i>this</i> wine has fallen off.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.843
Well, I actually know wine, too.
Yeah, it's part of my job.

30:16.160 --> 30:18.322
[Tommy] And this wine has not fallen off.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.291
But, you know what?
I'll be glad to double-check for you.

30:23.720 --> 30:25.927
[Tommy] Glug, glug, glug,
glug, glug, glug.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.325
That's God's own nectar.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.324
- That's a thing of beauty.
- You know, at $90 a bottle,

30:38.440 --> 30:39.771
we shouldn't have to argue with you.

30:39.840 --> 30:42.411
No, there's no reason to argue.
This wine is spectacular.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.084
I'd like to speak to a manager.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.764
Absolutely. How can I help?

30:46.040 --> 30:50.170
Mrs. Kassidy, with a am I right?
[laughs nervously]

30:50.240 --> 30:51.526
Chef Patras.

30:51.840 --> 30:55.208
- You were here... two nights ago?
- I was.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.009
Welcome back. Welcome back.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.889
I'm so sorry if there's been
some kind of a confusion.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.490
There's no confusion, Chef.

31:00.560 --> 31:04.167
Mrs. Kassidy, with a

31:04.280 --> 31:06.806
Well, then let us get you
a new bottle-- on the house...

31:06.880 --> 31:09.247
And I say Miss Kassidy
is crazy with a

31:09.320 --> 31:11.891
- All right, listen!
- [Dion] You can just relax, man, relax.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.486
- Okay, just be cool, be cool.
- Be cool. Be cool.

31:14.800 --> 31:15.881
[sighs]

31:16.120 --> 31:19.010
Our sommelier is, you know,
he's very passionate about his wine.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.809
He gets a little-- a little carried away.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.407
Our chef is so passionate about other
people's wives that he carries them away.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.323
Right, okay, Tommy, right.
That's enough.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.890
Be careful. Hang on tight to this one.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.371
Let's talk out back, please.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.771
- You know what's dumb, Mrs. K?
- Tommy, come on!

31:30.880 --> 31:33.008
- Spelling Kassidy with a "K!"
- Would you stop?

31:33.120 --> 31:34.770
Who the hell do you think you are?

31:34.880 --> 31:36.166
Embarrassing me like that?!

31:36.240 --> 31:37.844
Oh, you're embarrassing yourself.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.490
Now, would you get upstairs
and sober up?

31:39.560 --> 31:40.686
Wine is <i>my</i> domain.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.842
Or are you trying to move in
on everything that's mine.

31:42.960 --> 31:45.008
Would you just stop?!
Look, you're pissed off at me,

31:45.080 --> 31:46.570
- you're taking it out on the customers!
- How many times?

31:47.920 --> 31:49.331
You said I could ask you anything.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.687
You said you'd tell me anything
I wanted to know.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.250
All right, well, now I want to know.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.800
How many times did you screw my wife?!

31:56.080 --> 31:58.651
- All right, come on.
- No, answer me, you son of a bitch.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.643
Chef, you might want to take this outside.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.721
Answer me!

32:01.800 --> 32:03.609
Tommy, the people in
the dining room can hear you.

32:06.680 --> 32:09.160
Pilar, get him upstairs.
Come on, you want to do this?!

32:09.280 --> 32:10.930
Come on! Outside now!

32:13.400 --> 32:17.007
All day! All day you've had
to come at me with this in private!

32:17.120 --> 32:19.248
But, no, you gotta lose
your shit in front of everyone!

32:19.320 --> 32:20.731
Yeah, including your own son.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.211
How many times?

32:22.600 --> 32:24.409
How many times, Dion?!

32:25.200 --> 32:27.043
- O-- once. [grunts]
- Liar.

32:29.760 --> 32:30.886
All right, it was a mistake.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.286
All right, it was a one-time mistake.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.283
Where else? Were you ever in our bed?

32:34.360 --> 32:37.170
- No. No, God, no.
- Liar.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.680
God! Okay, like,
you've gotta stop doing that.

32:40.760 --> 32:41.807
Did she like it, huh?

32:41.880 --> 32:43.644
Did she tell you how much she liked it?

32:43.720 --> 32:45.722
- Tommy, come on.
- Did she, huh?!

32:45.840 --> 32:48.207
We were drunk, all right?
We both felt bad about it!

32:48.320 --> 32:49.526
Liar!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.650
[grunting] God!

33:00.200 --> 33:01.406
Was she in love with you?

33:02.760 --> 33:04.205
I was in love with her.

33:07.080 --> 33:08.206
[Dion] There, I said it.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.405
Yeah, but she didn't love me, Tommy.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.926
Said the one thing that was wrong with me
was that I wasn't you.

33:13.160 --> 33:14.844
You son of a bitch.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.120
How did it happen?

33:52.200 --> 33:54.043
It was a long time ago, Tommy.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.846
Where... [clears throat]
Where was I?

33:57.920 --> 34:00.287
You were studying for your somm exam.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.241
I remember that.

34:04.680 --> 34:07.684
She was so happy
when I told her I passed.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.487
At least, I thought
that's why she was happy.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.243
Look, Tommy,
I don't know what to say. I'm...

34:17.320 --> 34:18.560
I'm sorry.

34:20.280 --> 34:21.645
Jesus, you're good.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.248
When I asked you if you'd slept with her,

34:28.320 --> 34:30.971
you-- you made me think
I was out of my mind.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.524
You actually made <i>me</i> feel guilty

34:34.600 --> 34:37.080
for even thinking you could do that to me.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.161
I know.

34:38.560 --> 34:40.880
L-- I know you must think
that I'm cowardly,

34:40.960 --> 34:42.121
and that I'm pathetic, but...

34:42.440 --> 34:45.728
I would have gone through anything
to stop you from finding out.

34:45.800 --> 34:47.484
I mean, she was gone.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.685
I didn't want my friend
feeling any more pain than he had to.

34:55.080 --> 34:56.445
We're not friends.

35:01.680 --> 35:03.603
[sniffs] You gotta move out, tonight.

35:04.480 --> 35:05.891
We'll keep uh...

35:06.160 --> 35:09.004
keep Thirio open for a little while
for the crew.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.764
But you and me, we're done.

Yeah, I walked into a door.

Yeah, it's looking like
it's gonna do well, and...

37:46.840 --> 37:48.604
