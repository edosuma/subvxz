Lucky:
Gee, Colonel,

01:12.710 --> 01:15.080
you must have seen
a lot of action.

01:15.080 --> 01:19.170
Oh, Lucky, my boy,
it's been a long, long road.

01:19.170 --> 01:20.420
For example,

01:20.420 --> 01:23.210
here I am at
the Great Grutley Kibble Caper.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.750
Cool.

01:24.750 --> 01:28.170
Colonel:
And here I am at the infamous
Flea Bath Uprising.

01:28.170 --> 01:31.290
Oh yes, and this,
this was taken

01:31.290 --> 01:34.120
just before
my most harrowing mission:

01:34.120 --> 01:36.420
Operation Chew Toy.

01:36.420 --> 01:39.380
Wow, action and adventure,

01:39.380 --> 01:41.500
and that cool thing
around your neck.

01:41.500 --> 01:43.250
Oh, yes,

01:43.250 --> 01:45.170
the regimental scarf.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.380
Quite a beauty, eh?

01:46.380 --> 01:47.750
Are you kidding?

01:47.750 --> 01:50.250
I'd look great
in one of those.

01:53.290 --> 01:54.880
Tell you what, son.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.580
How would you like
to wear it for the day?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.080
Seriously?

02:07.120 --> 02:09.580
Rolly:
Hey, Lucky.

02:09.580 --> 02:11.210
Are you comin' or not?

02:11.210 --> 02:12.580
We're looking for rocks!

02:13.920 --> 02:15.120
Whoa.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.080
Where was this one taken?

02:19.250 --> 02:23.040
Oh, it looks like a swamp.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.170
Some call it that,

02:25.170 --> 02:27.750
others call it
the Widow-maker.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.380
Satan's Punch Bowl.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.120
El Perdido.

02:32.120 --> 02:33.920
El Perdido?

02:33.920 --> 02:35.710
Wow.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.290
Colonel:
Whatever you do,

02:37.290 --> 02:42.210
don't ever, ever,
ever step foot in there.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.960
Rolly:
But the Colonel said

02:47.960 --> 02:51.880
not to ever, ever,
ever step foot in there.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.290
I haven't.

02:53.290 --> 02:54.330
Yet.

02:54.330 --> 02:56.830
I thought we were
looking for rocks.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.040
Darkness.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.710
Darkness.

03:02.710 --> 03:05.790
Um, I think I hear
lunch calling.

03:05.790 --> 03:06.790
Let's go.

03:08.210 --> 03:09.920
Come on, you guys.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.120
Don't you understand?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.750
We're on the threshold
of greatness.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.830
Where's your pioneer spirit?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.790
Where's your sense
of adventure?

03:20.210 --> 03:21.040
Where's--

03:21.040 --> 03:22.080
Whoa!

03:24.710 --> 03:26.670
Where's the scarf?

03:34.710 --> 03:37.080
We've gotta get
the scarf back.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.880
We need a plan.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.210
We
What plan? No plan!

03:41.210 --> 03:43.040
We tell the Colonel,
that's the plan.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.420
Let's go!

03:44.420 --> 03:49.120
But the Colonel told us
not to ever, ever, ever step--

03:49.120 --> 03:51.080
Don't. Worry.

04:00.670 --> 04:02.790
I just got a plan.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.290
I don't like this plan!

04:19.380 --> 04:21.750
I hope you're satisfied.

04:21.750 --> 04:24.040
Nope. We gotta try again.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.170
I knew it was her.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.080
I said a scarf,
not a muffler!

05:03.080 --> 05:04.750
(animals howling and shrieking

05:10.960 --> 05:12.960
But the Colonel said

05:12.960 --> 05:15.920
not to ever,
ever step foot in here.

05:15.920 --> 05:17.830
We're not steppin'.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.210
We're wading.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.330
Welcome. Velkommen.
Bienvenidos.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.540
Hi. I'm Lucky.

05:34.540 --> 05:36.710
Well, you certainly
are lucky you met me

05:36.710 --> 05:38.580
and I am lucky
I met you.

05:38.580 --> 05:39.620
End of story.

05:39.620 --> 05:41.120
Can I interest you
in a color TV...

05:41.120 --> 05:42.250
knob?

05:42.250 --> 05:43.580
How about a washer-dryer...

05:43.580 --> 05:44.620
lint?

05:44.620 --> 05:46.500
Perhaps a kitchen sink...

05:46.500 --> 05:47.670
faucet?

05:47.670 --> 05:48.750
'57 Chevy...

05:48.750 --> 05:50.460
muffler?

05:50.460 --> 05:53.290
No thanks.
We have one.

05:53.290 --> 05:54.580
We're looking for a scarf.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.920
Scarf! Mmm.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.210
How interestin'.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.040
Perhaps we should discuss this
over a friendly game of Chance?

06:13.080 --> 06:14.960
Round and round
and round she goes,

06:14.960 --> 06:16.880
where she stops,
nobody knows.

06:18.880 --> 06:19.920
Easy.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.750
Oh, that was so close.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.830
Hey, that's attached!

06:34.830 --> 06:37.750
Well now, I'm sure
that luckity-luckity luck

06:37.750 --> 06:38.960
of yours will kick in soon.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.120
Care to go again?

06:41.120 --> 06:44.330
Listen, rat, just tell us
how we can get the scarf.

06:44.330 --> 06:48.540
Oh, you mean the scarf
I found in the swamp?

06:48.540 --> 06:49.920
Yes.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.000
-Yes.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.960
-Yes.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.290
-All: Yes!

06:56.290 --> 06:58.500
Sorry, sold it
to the snake.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.750
This time, I do the talking.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.830
Yesssss?

07:11.830 --> 07:15.040
Ahem. Excuse me,
sir, may I--

07:15.040 --> 07:18.670
Sssorry, I gave
at the officcce.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.960
Well, that's that.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.040
What's what?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.830
We're not giving up
that easy.

07:26.830 --> 07:30.960
Ooh, I'm sensing
a little friction here.

07:30.960 --> 07:34.330
Let's all put on
a happy face

07:34.330 --> 07:36.210
and try again.

07:38.540 --> 07:42.670
What part of "no"
don't you undersssstand?

07:42.670 --> 07:45.710
I sense
the pain you're feeling.

07:45.710 --> 07:47.960
And I've come
to share with you.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.330
To share and care.

07:50.330 --> 07:51.750
Come on, guys!

07:51.750 --> 07:53.080
Group hug!

07:57.750 --> 08:01.040
Yesss, group hug.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.080
I'm sure I can find time

08:03.080 --> 08:07.080
to sssqueeze you
into my busy ssschedule.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.790
That's better, isn't it?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.960
Cadpig...

08:11.960 --> 08:14.670
Now that
we've shared with you,

08:14.670 --> 08:16.580
will you share with us?

08:17.580 --> 08:19.040
Cadpig!

08:19.040 --> 08:21.670
Cccertainly.

08:21.670 --> 08:23.920
Have you seen a scarf?

08:23.920 --> 08:25.750
Cadpig!

08:25.750 --> 08:30.830
Sssorry, I sssold it
to Sssteven.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.580
Ssslippery little sssuckers.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.620
Thanks a lot, Cadpig.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.920
He nearly squeezed
the kibble out of me.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.250
We just gotta find
this guy Steven.

08:53.250 --> 08:55.330
Uh... look.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.000
That's a Steven?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.790
No problem.

09:02.790 --> 09:04.380
I'll get it.

09:04.380 --> 09:06.460
Don't press
your lucky-luck, Lucky.

09:06.460 --> 09:07.830
This chicken
ain't no chicken,

09:07.830 --> 09:08.960
so step aside.

09:25.710 --> 09:26.790
I got it!

09:31.750 --> 09:33.290
Oh, hello.

09:33.290 --> 09:34.620
You must be Steven.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.620
Hmm... five aces.

09:55.620 --> 09:57.750
-Somebody's cheatin'.
-Incomin'!

10:23.880 --> 10:25.330
We lost him.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.330
Ugh.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.330
My dogs are killin' me.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.880
"Dogs"?

10:36.620 --> 10:37.750
Everything's okay now.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.880
We just gotta get
the scarf back to the Colonel.

10:40.960 --> 10:42.420
Uh-oh.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.290
Don't worry.
Just be cool.

10:46.290 --> 10:47.620
I can handle the Colonel.

10:47.620 --> 10:49.120
Just keep it quiet.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.790
Act natural
and he'll never know.

10:51.790 --> 10:53.540
Colonel:
You ignored my warning

10:53.540 --> 10:55.170
and went into the swamp,
didn't ya?

10:56.540 --> 10:58.210
Well, Cadets?

10:58.210 --> 10:59.460
Ohh.

10:59.460 --> 11:02.540
Yes!

11:02.540 --> 11:05.670
Why did you puppies
disregard my advice?

11:05.670 --> 11:07.580
Well, sir, it was
for a good reason.

11:07.580 --> 11:09.540
We had to get
your scarf back.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.620
Oh.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.120
The scarf can be replaced.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.330
You can't.

11:18.330 --> 11:21.540
Tibbs and I will have to consult
regarding a suitable punishment.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.210
Cadets dismissed.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.750
Well, they're
a different generation,

11:26.750 --> 11:30.830
you know, a free-wheeling,
thrill-seeking...

11:30.830 --> 11:34.880
Yeah. It's a lesson
we've all had to learn.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.790
Go, Spot! Go! Go!

11:54.790 --> 11:57.460
Puppies:
Yeah! Come on, Rolly!

11:57.460 --> 11:59.620
Spot:
Gonna cross the finish line!

12:15.040 --> 12:16.880
Puppy:
Yay Wizzer and Mooch!

12:16.880 --> 12:18.540
You know, in a relay race,

12:18.540 --> 12:20.830
they don't have
a slow lane!

12:26.460 --> 12:28.580
Princess, please.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.920
You're embarrassin' me.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.380
Just try rootin'?

12:33.380 --> 12:35.580
Stick my nose in that?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.750
Huh. Yeah right.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.920
I don't mean
to sound judgmental,

12:51.920 --> 12:55.830
but do you have to be
such a colossal swine?

12:55.830 --> 12:59.710
Oh now, sweetie pig,
it's swill.

12:59.710 --> 13:03.120
Not knowin' where it comes from
is half the fun!

13:03.120 --> 13:06.540
Forget it.
I'm ordering dim sum.

13:06.540 --> 13:09.710
Oh, I've had it
with you, missy!

13:09.710 --> 13:11.330
Lucky:
Didn't I tell you

13:11.330 --> 13:13.460
not to use the tree branch
after you eat?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.380
Now we're gonna
miss Thunderbolt.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.830
I think I'm retaining water.

13:17.830 --> 13:20.420
I think you're
retaining donuts!

13:20.420 --> 13:22.880
Are you callin' me fat?

13:22.880 --> 13:24.830
If the tree fits.

13:27.380 --> 13:28.420
Oof!

13:30.500 --> 13:32.920
Hey, is that swill?

13:32.920 --> 13:36.580
Oh, my life
is miserable.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.540
My life is miserable.

13:40.540 --> 13:43.380
Well, she won't root,
she won't waller,

13:43.380 --> 13:45.120
she surely won't gorge.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.290
I'm tellin' you, boy,
if I didn't know different,

13:48.290 --> 13:51.380
I'd swear she weren't no pig.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.500
"Rolly, you eat too much."

13:53.500 --> 13:55.830
"Rolly, you sleep too much."

13:55.830 --> 13:59.380
"Rolly, your butt
is blockin' the sun."

13:59.380 --> 14:02.380
Why don't they just
come out and say it?

14:02.380 --> 14:05.620
"Rolly, we think you're a pig."

14:11.540 --> 14:14.670
I'm tellin' you, son,
we'd make the perfect pair.

14:14.670 --> 14:18.170
Ahh, I just don't know, sir.

14:18.170 --> 14:20.620
Call me Ed.

14:22.210 --> 14:24.170
Oh, maybe I have been

14:24.170 --> 14:26.040
too hard on Daddy.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.250
After all, someday
this will all be mine.

14:29.250 --> 14:32.250
Yep, someday
this will all be yours.

14:32.250 --> 14:33.920
-The straw...

14:33.920 --> 14:36.000
the mud,
even the manure.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.540
But why me?

14:37.540 --> 14:41.120
Because you need somebody
who would appreciate you

14:41.120 --> 14:43.500
and I need a protégé.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.750
A what?

14:44.750 --> 14:46.080
A what?

14:46.080 --> 14:48.170
Protégé,
you know, an heir,

14:48.170 --> 14:49.420
a next-in-line.

14:49.420 --> 14:53.620
After all, somebody's gotta
be mayor when I retire.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.620
But what about Dumpling?

14:55.620 --> 14:58.040
Yeah, what about Dumpling?

14:58.040 --> 14:59.790
Look here,
I love Dumpling.

14:59.790 --> 15:01.540
She's the apple
of my eye,

15:01.540 --> 15:03.420
my little puddin' pie.

15:03.420 --> 15:04.790
But let's face it.

15:04.790 --> 15:08.210
She'll never be
half the pig you are.

15:08.210 --> 15:09.750
Think about it, son.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.750
Fame, power, slop,

15:12.750 --> 15:15.620
and riches beyond belief!

15:15.620 --> 15:18.460
Oh, wow!

15:20.540 --> 15:22.880
Of course, this is
a big decision,

15:22.880 --> 15:24.620
so you should
take your time.

15:24.620 --> 15:28.170
Think about it.
Don't rush into anything.

15:28.170 --> 15:31.380
Wh-- what do you mean
you're moving out tonight?

15:31.380 --> 15:35.750
I told you, I don't want to stay
where I'm not appreciated.

15:35.750 --> 15:37.040
But you're gonna miss out.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.620
Nanny just ordered us
a big heap of treats.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.460
I don't want your treats.

15:41.460 --> 15:44.540
You called me a pig,
you treat me like a pig,

15:44.540 --> 15:46.580
so I'm gonna go be a pig!

15:46.580 --> 15:48.380
Well... good!

15:48.380 --> 15:50.380
That leaves more food for us!

15:50.380 --> 15:52.420
Yeah, and more room.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.380
Ahh, once you start missing us,
you'll be back here

15:55.380 --> 15:57.540
with your tail
between your legs.

15:58.670 --> 16:01.380
He will be back,
won't he?

16:28.250 --> 16:29.290
Both:
Huh?

16:30.580 --> 16:32.040
Hmm...

16:34.380 --> 16:35.380
Bring the rope.

16:45.460 --> 16:46.960
Eh, Jasper?

16:49.790 --> 16:51.540
Hey! Hey! Come back!

16:51.540 --> 16:54.210
Aah! Somebody stop that truck!

16:55.540 --> 16:57.330
-No!

17:01.330 --> 17:03.460
Rolly and Ed love
living together.

17:03.460 --> 17:08.290
Oh yeah, trust me,
today it's the honeymoon phase.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.380
Tomorrow, divorce pork.

17:10.380 --> 17:13.210
You guys comin'
to the big celebration?

17:13.210 --> 17:14.290
What celebration?

17:15.540 --> 17:18.580
"Ed Pig invites you
to celebrate the arrival

17:18.580 --> 17:22.170
of City Hall's newest,
permanent resident, Rolly."

17:22.170 --> 17:24.330
Why didn't we get invited?

17:24.330 --> 17:27.120
I'll bet Rolly wants
to ask us in person.

17:27.120 --> 17:29.790
It's so much more...
personal.

17:29.790 --> 17:32.710
Hey, Two-Tone.
You comin' to my party?

17:32.710 --> 17:34.080
I think so.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.290
Oh, maybe not.

17:36.290 --> 17:37.620
I'll try.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.080
Can I get back to you?

17:39.080 --> 17:40.880
Well, I hope
you can make it.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.290
All my friends
will be there.

17:44.670 --> 17:49.330
And now for the second phase
of the grieving process...

17:49.330 --> 17:51.210
anger!

17:54.750 --> 17:57.790
Now don't eat
the bunting, son.

17:57.790 --> 17:59.380
You're the best, Ed.

17:59.380 --> 18:02.420
You've given me a home,
taught me the ropes,

18:02.420 --> 18:05.330
and now you're gonna
throw me a party

18:05.330 --> 18:07.210
with your own food.

18:07.210 --> 18:12.330
About that my own food part...

18:13.420 --> 18:15.290
Rolly:
Those must be the treats

18:15.290 --> 18:17.170
Nanny ordered
for the dogs.

18:17.170 --> 18:21.040
Heh. Correction:
they was for the dogs.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.880
Now they're the chow
for your party.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.170
All's you gotta do
is get 'em.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.750
I can't take those!

18:27.750 --> 18:29.210
Of course you can't.

18:29.210 --> 18:31.290
They're way too heavy, boy.

18:31.290 --> 18:33.710
That's why I hired help.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.170
Howdy.

18:35.170 --> 18:38.330
Uh, can I talk
to you in private?

18:38.330 --> 18:40.830
Sure, son.
Take five.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.250
Ah-ah-ah.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.080
Save it for the chicken.

18:49.080 --> 18:51.830
I can't steal
from my family.

18:51.830 --> 18:54.750
Ho, ho, ho now,
this ain't stealin'.

18:54.750 --> 18:58.250
It's an involuntary
campaign contribution.

19:07.170 --> 19:10.040
What's eatin' you,
golden boy?

19:10.040 --> 19:13.000
Your dad wants me
to steal from my family.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.750
It isn't stealing.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.170
It's an involuntary...

19:18.170 --> 19:20.750
Both:
...campaign contribution.

19:20.750 --> 19:24.040
I know,
but I still can't do it.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.210
Even after everything
that's happened,

19:26.210 --> 19:27.920
they're still my family.

19:27.920 --> 19:30.420
Great, you squeeze me out

19:30.420 --> 19:32.960
so that you can be
Daddy's protégé

19:32.960 --> 19:35.380
and now you won't play
his game.

19:35.380 --> 19:38.120
If you can't stand the stink,
get out of the sty.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.500
And go where?

19:40.500 --> 19:42.250
I can't go back
to the barn.

19:42.250 --> 19:44.290
I've burned that bridge.

19:44.290 --> 19:48.040
Hey, you want out
and I want in.

19:48.040 --> 19:52.210
Maybe it's time
we join forces.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.380
Oh well, well, well,

19:57.380 --> 20:00.670
if it isn't
my favorite pig-dog.

20:00.670 --> 20:02.170
Did you get the food?

20:02.170 --> 20:03.250
Oh yeah.

20:03.250 --> 20:07.290
I got so much food,
I thought I'd start
the party early.

20:07.290 --> 20:11.170
Glorioski, you should've
woken me, boy.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.170
I got me a three-hour
welcomin' speech to give.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.290
That's my chow!

20:23.290 --> 20:27.330
You promised them a feed,
I delivered a feed.

20:27.330 --> 20:31.040
Well, you couldn't take
the doggy treats, huh?

20:31.040 --> 20:33.080
Well, that's just fine.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.250
From this day on,
you're no pig of mine!

20:39.080 --> 20:42.290
Get your snouts out
of my food!

20:43.750 --> 20:47.500
Actually, Daddy,
by using your own chow,

20:47.500 --> 20:50.710
you come across as
a real hog of the people.

20:50.710 --> 20:52.460
And with the upcoming election,

20:52.460 --> 20:55.540
that's gotta be worth
its weight in votes.

20:55.540 --> 20:58.960
Get your snouts
back in my food!

21:00.040 --> 21:03.000
The party's on me!

21:03.000 --> 21:05.290
Great idea, pumpkin.

21:05.290 --> 21:08.790
Not only are you
beautiful and fragrant,

21:08.790 --> 21:10.580
but you're smart too.

21:10.580 --> 21:15.670
Heh. Looks like I had me
a protégé all along.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.040
Come on, partner.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.960
Let's eat.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.330
Rolly loved Thunderbolt.

21:23.330 --> 21:25.460
This whole thing
is your fault.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.460
You were the one
who called him slow.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.620
Me

21:29.620 --> 21:33.120
She used the words
"colossal swine."

21:33.120 --> 21:36.920
You know, I think
that we've entered
the third stage of grief here:

21:36.920 --> 21:38.120
blame.

21:38.120 --> 21:40.960
And I blame
both of you.

21:45.830 --> 21:47.210
At my urging,

21:47.210 --> 21:49.460
Rolly has graciously decided

21:49.460 --> 21:51.580
to give you another chance.

21:51.580 --> 21:54.080
Well, I don't know
if we want him back.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.960
He did kind of blow us off.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.790
Hey, I don't know either.

21:57.790 --> 22:01.000
You guys were really mean
to me, and, uh...

22:03.670 --> 22:05.290
Both:
I love you, man!

22:05.290 --> 22:07.040
Both:
Group hug!
