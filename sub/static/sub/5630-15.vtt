00:15.716 --> 00:17.249
- Nice and slow, please.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.250
One foot in front of the other.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.251
- How you doing tonight, sir?

00:19.253 --> 00:20.753
- Good, officer.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.654
Appreciate you guys
being out here tonight.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.023
- Yeah, where you coming from?

00:24.025 --> 00:25.157
- Hawks game.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.692
- Come on.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.093
- Tough duty on a cold night.

00:28.095 --> 00:29.328
- Yeah.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.429
Where you coming from?
- Home.

00:30.431 --> 00:31.663
- You been drinking?

00:31.665 --> 00:35.334
- No, ma'am.
I'm on my way to a lecture.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.602
- At this hour?

00:36.604 --> 00:39.338
- The lecture's tomorrow.
Windsor University.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.339
- So Canada.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.541
- That's right.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.176
- You're getting a late start.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.210
- I'm a night owl.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.313
[dog barks]

00:52.085 --> 00:53.419
- You mind
if I check your trunk?

00:53.421 --> 00:55.721
- Not at all.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.125
- Roman?
- Yeah.

01:00.127 --> 01:03.228
<i>[indistinct radio chatter]</i>

01:05.598 --> 01:08.167
- What is it?

01:08.169 --> 01:10.069
- I don't know.

01:10.071 --> 01:12.771
- Looks clean.

01:13.773 --> 01:15.340
- Send down the K-9.

01:15.342 --> 01:18.444
[barking]

01:21.081 --> 01:23.315
This is where
the dog indicated.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.683
- There's nothing in there.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.519
- Then you got
nothing to worry about.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.359
- You put in a new sound system?

01:34.361 --> 01:36.395
- No.

01:36.397 --> 01:37.563
- Well...

01:37.565 --> 01:39.331

01:53.213 --> 01:55.347
Ooh.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.687
- I have no idea what that is.

02:01.689 --> 02:05.124
- I'll tell you what this is.

02:05.126 --> 02:08.426
It's heroin.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.794
- You have the right
to remain silent.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.231
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

02:12.233 --> 02:14.233
in a court of law.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.508
- I swear to you, I have no idea
how the drugs got there.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.676
I'm obviously not a drug dealer.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.912
Surely there's
another explanation.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.881
- Well, you're the one who
has to give us an explanation.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.150
Why were you leaving the city
with ten kilos of heroin?

02:31.152 --> 02:32.417
- I was going to give a lecture.

02:32.419 --> 02:34.186
That's all I know.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.588
How long is the--
the bail process?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.490
- Your bond is based
on the street value

02:38.492 --> 02:40.259
of the seized narcotics.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.361
Cost you half a million
to walk out of here,

02:42.363 --> 02:44.229
but we can sit on you
for 48 hours

02:44.231 --> 02:46.899
and we've got ten kilos
of probable cause

02:46.901 --> 02:48.800
to put you in a county lockup

02:48.802 --> 02:51.336
and trust me, your life
would never be the same.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.438
- Look,

02:53.440 --> 02:54.873
it's pretty clear
what's going on here.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.843
Somebody put you up to this.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.311
Just do yourself a favor.

02:59.313 --> 03:03.549
- Believe me, Sergeant, I wish
I could tell you something.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.651
- Professor,

03:05.653 --> 03:09.354
I don't know
if you're scared or confused,

03:09.356 --> 03:14.359
to think about the consequences
of the situation you're in.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.798
[door closes]

03:19.800 --> 03:22.734
- Hey, Sarge, you got a second?

03:22.736 --> 03:24.670
- One Mississippi.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.438
- I was wondering,
I put in all my FTO paperwork

03:26.440 --> 03:29.775
is a letter of recommendation
from a supervisor.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.510
- Hmm.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.379
- Most people want to be
Field Training Officers

03:34.381 --> 03:35.547
for the extra money.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.216
I happen to take it
very seriously.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.217
- Me too.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.885
I think I'd be a great teacher.

03:39.887 --> 03:40.886
- Based on?

03:40.888 --> 03:42.354
- Gut feeling.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.723
- Yeah, he's got a way
of looking at things.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.293
- You and me, field test, today.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.296
- Great.

03:51.298 --> 03:52.698
- I'm looking forward
to seeing it.

03:52.700 --> 03:57.869
Me and Boy Wonder
are riding alone.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.472
- Good luck.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.940
- Marijuana?

04:01.942 --> 04:04.443
- It's medical marijuana,
and as you know,

04:04.445 --> 04:07.512
it's perfectly legal in Chicago
as of six months ago.

04:07.514 --> 04:08.714
- All right,
I'm not so sure, man.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.650
to move up in the world,
get some scratch for a condo.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.652
Well, it's a high-paid gig,
the owner's totally legit.

04:13.654 --> 04:14.753
She has an MBA
from Northwestern.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.854
- Who's this?
Who we got?

04:15.856 --> 04:16.855
- Here's somebody
you never thought

04:16.857 --> 04:18.023
would get mixed up in drugs.

04:18.024 --> 04:21.326
Adam Ames.
61 years old.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.663
He's got no criminal record, not
even an overdue library book.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.565
He's married
with three adult children.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.001
He's a respected professor
at Central Chicago University

04:29.003 --> 04:31.870
where he teaches social ethics,
whatever that's about.

04:31.872 --> 04:34.773
running ten kilos of heroin
into Canada.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.341
- Yeah, doesn't sound like
he has financial problems.

04:36.343 --> 04:39.044
- Professor could be
getting played.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.312
- Yeah, remember that guy
that got killed

04:40.314 --> 04:42.047
bringing bullets in from Canada?

04:42.049 --> 04:44.516
Turned out his nephew
put the load in the trunk.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.884
Remember that?

04:45.886 --> 04:48.020
- We're not gonna charge Ames
yet but just hold him.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.389
We'll see if we can
scare out the big fish.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.990
- The way the trap was built,
I got a good idea who did it.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.526
- Good, lean on the trap guy.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.295
- So who do you think it is?

04:56.297 --> 04:59.398
- His name's Beto; guy runs
a car stereo supply store--

04:59.400 --> 05:02.801
I was thinking we could
bring Burgess up on this.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.002
You know, she's
the original case officer.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.804
Give her a chance
to see it through.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.440
- I already offered Burgess
a spot in this unit.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.608
She turned it down.

05:09.610 --> 05:12.744
- Everybody deserves
a second chance.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.313
That's what it said
on the coffee shop chalkboard

05:14.315 --> 05:15.447
this morning.

05:15.449 --> 05:16.915
- No kidding.

05:18.951 --> 05:21.586
- Come on.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.527
- Just make it clear
it's only a field trip.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.795
- Thank you.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.799
Burgess.
- Yes.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.100
- Change out of those blues.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.636
You're riding with me today.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.404
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:39.406 --> 05:41.006
Voight cleared it with Platt.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.007
I'll see you in the roll up.

05:42.009 --> 05:46.545
- Hey, um, what about Ruzek?

05:46.547 --> 05:48.747
- This isn't about him.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.550
You pulled a major load
off the street.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.686
Besides, when do we
ever get to work together?

05:54.688 --> 05:58.457
- Yeah.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.425
- You should probably drive,
right?

06:00.427 --> 06:02.527
- You're asking?

06:02.529 --> 06:05.664
will be forever imprinted
by your methods.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.432
First lesson
I learned from my FTO,

06:07.434 --> 06:09.868
take charge of the situation.

06:09.870 --> 06:13.772
- Right, so here's the keys.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.807
- You know what?

06:15.809 --> 06:19.978
I am a freshly minted officer
out of the academy

06:19.980 --> 06:21.813
and you are my teacher.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.383
I'm a lump of clay.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.384
Mold me.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.385
- Look, Sarge, can you--

06:26.387 --> 06:29.087
- Officer.
Officer Trudy Platt.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.722
- Okay, Officer.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.091
Drive.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.429
- Oh, and just so you know,

06:37.431 --> 06:39.664
the reason I want to become
a policeman

06:39.666 --> 06:44.069
is to get rid of the bad guys,
make the world a better place.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.177
- We've been trying
to reach him.

06:52.179 --> 06:55.814
I mean, there's obviously been
some kind of mistake.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.115
- Ma'am, if there's been
a mistake,

06:57.117 --> 06:58.817
it looks like
your husband made it.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.619
- He said he was going
to Canada.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.721
- He teaches a seminar
at Windsor University.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.157
- Have you noticed
any unusual behavior lately?

07:05.159 --> 07:07.559
- My husband hasn't changed
in 30 years,

07:07.561 --> 07:09.961
and trust me,
he is not a criminal.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.696
- Do you work, Mrs. Ames?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.165
- I volunteer.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.967
- It's just a very nice house
on a professor's salary.

07:15.969 --> 07:19.004
- The money comes from
my side of the family.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.539
This is a mistake.

07:20.541 --> 07:21.740
You have the wrong man.
[door shuts]

07:21.742 --> 07:23.141
- Mom,
I just got your message.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.544
- Pearl, these are
police officers.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.845
- Why is my dad in jail?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.581
- Because we found 10 kilos
of heroin in his car.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.650
- That is crazy.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.618
There's no way
that could ever happen.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.054
- Well, either your dad's mixed
up with the wrong people,

07:36.056 --> 07:38.089
or he's the unluckiest man
in the world.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.225
- You've got the wrong person.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.227
Have you called the lawyer?
- I just found out.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.995
- Mom, what are you doing?
Call the lawyer.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.764
- Does anyone else
ever use his car?

07:45.766 --> 07:46.832
- Like maybe his daughter?

07:46.834 --> 07:49.968
- Mom, they're accusing Dad
of smuggling drugs.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.237
And no, he never lets anybody
use his car.

07:52.239 --> 07:54.039
I have my own car.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.708
You want to see
if there's anything in there?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.776
- I'm sorry.

07:57.778 --> 08:01.112
Now, I do need to call
the lawyer.

08:03.115 --> 08:07.886
- We just found one of your
traps in a green RAV4.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.621
Real state of the art.

08:09.623 --> 08:13.225
Those two screws
in the speaker panel, huh?

08:13.227 --> 08:16.561
Come on, man, nobody builds 'em
like Beto, right?

08:16.563 --> 08:18.897
But the trouble is,

08:18.899 --> 08:20.966
it was loaded
with ten bricks of heroin.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.267
- I build 'em.
I don't fill 'em.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.970
- Is this the guy
who brought you the car?

08:24.972 --> 08:26.671
- Never saw him before.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.107
Were you officers aware
that it is now legal

08:29.109 --> 08:31.142
to build concealed traps
in cars

08:31.144 --> 08:32.644
in the state of Illinois?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.712
- Oh, you know
what's still not legal?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.715
Taking cash for jobs
you're not declaring.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.884
That trap alone
cost five grand.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.619
Uncle Sam get his taste?

08:40.621 --> 08:42.120
- Still working
on the paperwork.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.755
- We need a name or I'm
calling my friend at the IRS

08:43.756 --> 08:44.990
and we'll shut this place down.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.292
- Who brought you the car?

08:47.294 --> 08:49.027
- Johnny Z.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.028
- Who's that?

08:50.030 --> 08:51.029
- Johnny's a carrion.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.030
Small-time chump.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.598
- You got a contact?

08:55.635 --> 08:58.203
- Take the back.
- We got smoke.

08:58.205 --> 09:02.073
[smoke alarm blaring]

09:02.075 --> 09:03.542
5021 David.

09:03.544 --> 09:07.112
Roll fire
to 4822 North Allen Avenue.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.713
We got heavy smoke
coming out the front floor.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.714
- <i>Copy that.</i>
<i>-</i> Go.

09:09.716 --> 09:10.715
- [grunts]

09:10.717 --> 09:11.850
[smoke alarm blaring]

09:11.852 --> 09:14.553
[all coughing]

09:14.555 --> 09:16.288
- It smells like burnt hair.

09:16.290 --> 09:19.591
- Chicago PD.
Is anybody home?

09:19.593 --> 09:22.761
If anybody's down here,
call out.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.596
- Body.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.332
[coughing]

09:41.180 --> 09:42.914
- Clear.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.653
- In here.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.930
- All right, two things we know,

09:58.932 --> 10:00.799
the corpse is male
and he was burned alive.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.133
It's because of the fists.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.369
Heat contracts live muscles.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.071
- We think it's Johnny Zakarian.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.007
He's a match for height
and weight description.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.643
- So Johnny didn't just put
the trap in the professor's car.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.811
He arranged the heroin,

10:12.813 --> 10:15.880
someone got pissed
when we seized it.

10:15.882 --> 10:20.685
All right, have forensics
make a positive ID.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.028
- Execution.
One bullet.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.896
- Michael Perry.

10:31.898 --> 10:33.198
Lives up the street.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.934
Kid's only nine years old.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.281
- Check this out.

10:50.283 --> 10:53.184
Maybe a girlfriend.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.657
- Definitely a girlfriend.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.991
- Hey.
- Sarge.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.793
- Mouse ran the professor's
phone and emails.

11:01.795 --> 11:02.994
There's no connection
to Zakarian.

11:02.996 --> 11:06.197
- Looks like Zakarian
had a girlfriend.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.299
Natalie Minos.
Found her pill.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.001
- All right,
find Zakarian's girlfriend.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.703
Maybe she can connect him
to the professor.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.438
- Sergeant,
we got a lady outside,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.173
says her son's gone missing.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.877
Said he was outside
selling candy or something.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.945
- I'll talk to her.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.419
Saw something
he wasn't supposed to see.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.226
- Can somebody tell me
what's going on?

11:35.228 --> 11:39.364
- Down the block.
My son is missing.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.365
- What's your son's name?

11:40.367 --> 11:46.137
He left this morning to sell
candy bars for his hockey team.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.339
- Come here.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.875
Um, can you describe him?

11:50.877 --> 11:53.745
- He's nine,
light brown hair.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.747
- Ms. Perry, we...

11:55.749 --> 11:58.416
found a body in that house.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.786
Matches your son's description.

12:01.788 --> 12:04.456
- No.
No.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.924
No.
No.

12:05.926 --> 12:06.958
- I'm sorry.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.761
- No--no!
No!

12:09.763 --> 12:11.429
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.832
Hey.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.471
- Johnny Zakarian.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.742
Johnny Zakarian.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.276
- Am I supposed to know
who that is?

12:25.278 --> 12:28.279
- Well, considering he's the guy
who put the trap in your car,

12:28.281 --> 12:30.749
that would make sense.

12:30.751 --> 12:34.419
- Well, if you say that's
what happened, then okay.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.121
- Here's what's not okay.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.189
Zakarian just got burned alive,

12:38.191 --> 12:41.426
and a nine-year-old boy,
who had nothing to do with this,

12:41.428 --> 12:45.063
got caught in the middle.

12:45.065 --> 12:48.199
If you had anything
to do with the heroin,

12:48.201 --> 12:51.269
you're now an accessory
to two murders.

12:51.271 --> 12:56.107
This just went
from bad to worse for you.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.376
- Uh,

12:58.378 --> 13:01.279
I had my car serviced last week.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.782
Maybe somebody
put the drugs in then.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.517
- Somebody who knew you were
driving up to Canada.

13:05.519 --> 13:06.918
That's some coincidence.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.219
- I'm trying to help.

13:08.221 --> 13:11.389
- Might be too late for that.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.294
[door closes]

13:16.296 --> 13:17.962
- Then I remembered,

13:17.964 --> 13:20.165
look, I left a toothbrush
at Ruzek's place.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.266
If I leave it there,

13:21.268 --> 13:22.300
it sends a message
I'm coming back

13:22.302 --> 13:23.802
but if I ask him for it,

13:23.804 --> 13:26.070
then he'll think
I'm obsessed about him.

13:26.072 --> 13:28.306
- Kim.
- Yeah.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.442
- Just buy a new toothbrush.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.211
- Hey, can I help you?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.513
- Yeah, you Natalie Minos?

13:35.515 --> 13:36.514
- Yes.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.551
We need to talk to you
about Johnny Zakarian.

13:39.553 --> 13:43.021
- We found your birth control
pills at his apartment.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.224
- Look, in this neighborhood,
we don't talk to police.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.426
- This is a double murder.
You don't have a choice.

13:57.903 --> 14:01.573
- I'll take some of those.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.908
- I was seeing Johnny
on and off.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.010
Mostly at night.
It was that kind of thing.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.246
- Okay, did you ever
meet Adam Ames?

14:08.248 --> 14:09.848
- No.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.217
- Look, I know that you want
to help, but you're scared.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.551
Give us a name,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.553
and then yell at us
to get the hell out of here

14:15.555 --> 14:18.523
and we'll play along.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.196
- Gregor Toros.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.132
He's doing demo
at the Furlow Building.

14:28.134 --> 14:30.468
Look, I told you,
I didn't know him, okay,

14:30.470 --> 14:34.939
and I can't help you,
so leave me alone.

14:34.941 --> 14:36.107
- 10-54.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.609
- Cows on the road.

14:37.611 --> 14:38.877
- 10-94.

14:38.879 --> 14:44.415
Hopefully not
while a 10-54 is in progress.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.218
Is that all you got?

14:47.220 --> 14:49.888
We don't even use 10 codes
anymore, and by the way,

14:49.890 --> 14:52.457
I've keyed my radio five times
with my right hand.

14:52.459 --> 14:55.026
My FTO taught me to always keep
my shooting hand available--

14:55.028 --> 14:56.361
- Stop the car.
- Excuse me?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.062
- I just got shot and
your awareness in this moment

14:58.064 --> 15:01.199
will determine if your partner
lives or dies.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.201
What block are we on?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.669
- 2800 West Augusta.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.204
- Cross street.
- California.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.172
- Nearest hospital?

15:08.174 --> 15:09.641
By the time the ambo arrives,
I'll have bled out.

15:09.643 --> 15:13.111
- Norwegian American,
two miles away.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.178
- The guy on the corner,
describe him.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.413
- Which guy?

15:15.415 --> 15:16.581
- The guy who shot me.
Don't turn around.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.618
- Uh, white, male,
20s, light blue parka.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.253
- That's not the one,
it was the other guy.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.321
- You got shot by the hipster?

15:23.323 --> 15:24.689
- Describe him.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.491
- White male, 20s, gray parka,

15:26.493 --> 15:29.193
the kind that look good
and can't keep you warm.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.529
- What color were his shoes?

15:33.532 --> 15:34.966
They were green.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.701
Always pay attention
to the shoes.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.069
A guy can ditch his coat

15:38.071 --> 15:40.471
but the shoes are much harder
to get rid of.

15:40.473 --> 15:44.075
[sighs]

15:44.077 --> 15:46.210
Time for lunch, patrolman.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.412
You're buying.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.381
- Oh--

15:58.190 --> 16:01.726
- Hey, man, we're looking
for Gregor Toros.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.162
- Hey!
Gregor!

16:04.164 --> 16:05.263
Gregor!

16:09.601 --> 16:11.169
- Nah, damn.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.071
Ah!
- Stop! Police!

16:13.073 --> 16:14.439
Hey!

16:27.653 --> 16:30.421
- Hey!
Hey--

16:30.423 --> 16:32.056
Where you gonna go?

16:33.425 --> 16:34.425
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.727
- Whoa, whoa, come on, bro.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.996
- Hey, hey.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.431
Look.
See?

16:40.433 --> 16:41.733
We don't want you.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.235
We just want to ask you
about Johnny Zakarian.

16:44.237 --> 16:45.336
That's it.
Come on.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.738
- It's too late.

16:46.740 --> 16:48.539
They will know
that I talked to you.

16:48.541 --> 16:50.074
- Look.
- Who you talking about?

16:50.076 --> 16:51.542
- They will punish my family.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.112
You just got to step away
from the ledge.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.113
Come on, now.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.448
Come back from the ledge, man.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.250
- [speaking Armenian]

16:59.252 --> 17:00.318
- No, no, no.
Ah!

17:00.320 --> 17:02.487
- Wait, whoa, whoa!

17:02.489 --> 17:04.222
[body thuds]

17:17.368 --> 17:18.736
- All right, thank you.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.739
immigrated from Armenia
five years ago.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.107
So did Johnny Zakarian.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.242
They were from the same village.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.510
- I don't speak Armenian,

17:25.512 --> 17:30.081
told us yesterday that his last
words were "I die with honor."

17:30.083 --> 17:32.650
- Back in Vice we took down
an Armenian gang in Rogers Park.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.119
It was mostly numbers
and prostitution.

17:35.121 --> 17:37.455
Guys who had just come over,
didn't trust the cops,

17:37.457 --> 17:43.094
- How did Mr. Rogers get mixed
up with the Armenian thugs?

17:43.096 --> 17:44.562
- I drilled into
Ames' financials.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.498
There's nothing out of whack
on the credit card.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.401
Trust, house,
both in his wife's name.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.470
The only thing
that Ames actually has

17:52.472 --> 17:54.639
is a pension from the university
which he had transferred over

17:54.641 --> 17:56.174
to an LLC entity.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.142
- Did he use his pension
to buy ten keys of heroin?

17:58.144 --> 18:01.579
The only payment that came
out of this account, though,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.114
is for an apartment.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.250
It's 324 8th Street.
It's in the South Loop.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.086
- Get a telephonic
search warrant.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.189
Hit the professor's apartment.
- Yes.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.324
- Hey, Kim.

18:13.326 --> 18:15.159
That was a really good bust.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.428
- Thanks, Ruzek.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.733
- Can't believe you made me eat
a sandwich wrapped in lettuce.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.402
- You got to stay away
from the carbs.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.572
- This is Chicago.
We put bread on meat.

18:27.574 --> 18:30.374
It gives us comfort.
It makes us strong.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.144
[siren wails]

18:36.315 --> 18:39.183
- Hey, what are you doing
in the middle of the street?

18:39.185 --> 18:41.385
Hey, sir, you lost?
- It's okay.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.687
- Not exactly
t-shirt weather.

18:42.689 --> 18:44.222
-  <i>Tengo frio.</i>

18:44.224 --> 18:45.790
<i>- Frio?</i>
<i>Frio?</i>

18:45.792 --> 18:48.359
All right,
you got a license or ID?

18:48.361 --> 18:49.861
- No.
- No?

18:49.863 --> 18:51.295
You speak English?

18:51.297 --> 18:53.631
- [whines]

18:53.633 --> 18:55.266
- All right,
what's your assessment?

18:55.268 --> 18:58.269
- Uh, he doesn't appear
to be homeless.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.604
Spanish-speaking.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.672
I don't think he's intoxicated.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.508
He might be
coming off drugs, though.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.810
- That's my read.
Now there's two ways to play it.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.645
We take him to the shelter,
get back on the beat,

19:07.647 --> 19:08.913
and I keep molding you,

19:08.915 --> 19:12.183
and spend the rest of the
afternoon filling out paperwork.

19:12.185 --> 19:13.918
You choose.
- District.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.419
- Call it a day?

19:15.421 --> 19:16.621
You going paws up
after the lettuce wrap?

19:16.623 --> 19:19.323
- I'm just playing it
by the book.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.159
- Look, uh, Trudy,

19:21.161 --> 19:23.628
maybe you're not
cut out for this.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.797
Come on.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.900
- What did you just call me?

19:28.902 --> 19:30.902
- So this apartment
was rented to an LLC

19:30.904 --> 19:32.370
owned by your husband.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.671
- I don't know
what to tell you.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.573
- So you know nothing
about the apartment?

19:35.575 --> 19:37.842
- I've never even been to
that part of the city.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.411
- Is there a chance
he was renting it to you?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.446
- No, I--
I wish.

19:42.448 --> 19:44.315
- Mrs. Ames,

19:44.317 --> 19:46.384
is it possible that your husband

19:46.386 --> 19:50.254
- A few hours ago, I would have
thought it was impossible

19:50.256 --> 19:51.756
that my husband was
a drug smuggler.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.791
So what do I know?

19:53.793 --> 19:55.493
Come, Pearl.

19:55.495 --> 19:59.263
The lawyer said
we shouldn't talk to police.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.732
- Wait.
Listen.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.900
I just want to say,

20:02.902 --> 20:07.371
I am so sorry for the way
I acted before.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.676
- I know this isn't easy.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.246
- Is there any way
I can see him?

20:15.248 --> 20:17.415
- Look, we're--
we're still in the process

20:17.417 --> 20:19.250
of interviews.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.918
Your dad is caught up in a lie

20:20.920 --> 20:22.887
and a lot of people
are getting hurt.

20:22.889 --> 20:27.458
He's the only one
who can fix this.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.327
- Yeah.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.729
It's just--

20:31.731 --> 20:33.864
he's my dad.

20:33.866 --> 20:38.336
He's the best person I know.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.571
- Look, Pearl, when we get to
the bottom of this thing

20:40.573 --> 20:43.908
and we tie this off, I promise,
you can see him.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.643
Okay?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.011
- Okay.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.452
[door opens]

21:03.996 --> 21:07.265
- The longer this goes,

21:07.267 --> 21:11.269
the deeper you get.

21:11.271 --> 21:13.838
And believe me, you are not
gonna crawl out from under this

21:13.840 --> 21:15.640
until you start
telling the truth.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.275
- I have been telling the truth.

21:17.277 --> 21:18.976
- Not the whole truth.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.013
You left out the apartment.

21:22.015 --> 21:23.648
The one you keep in the Loop?

21:23.650 --> 21:24.982
We checked with your wife.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.551
She didn't know about it.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.057
- I--

21:33.059 --> 21:35.059
That has nothing
to do with this.

21:35.061 --> 21:38.929
- Look at me.

21:38.931 --> 21:42.600
You're gonna
tell me what this is.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.839
What are we gonna find
in that apartment?

21:48.841 --> 21:53.511
- I'm not saying anything else
without my lawyer.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.813
- Stand up.

22:20.105 --> 22:23.407
[door closes]

22:25.377 --> 22:27.778
- I was tempted to call you guys
many times.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.014
You wouldn't believe
the parade of shady characters

22:30.016 --> 22:32.416
coming to this apartment.

22:34.986 --> 22:39.423
- Yeah, something's up here.
I can feel it in my bones.

22:39.425 --> 22:41.659
- Well, pretty fancy wines.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.028
- All right, let's check it out.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.017
Hey, I got something.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.423
The letters all have
the same return address.

23:12.425 --> 23:13.924
Stateville Prison.

23:13.926 --> 23:17.094
- This guy was pen pals
with convicts, all right.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.497
- The letters
are pretty...

23:19.499 --> 23:21.699
graphic.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.033
- And it's just not one guy.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.636
I mean, Rubicon Detention,

23:25.638 --> 23:28.472
Pinckneyville State.

23:28.474 --> 23:31.609
Professor's been writing
to ten other convicts.

23:38.850 --> 23:41.819
- We've established that
the professor had a secret life.

23:41.821 --> 23:44.488
He was communicating with
at least 11 convicts

23:44.490 --> 23:45.990
over the course of four years.

23:45.992 --> 23:49.560
He promises to help them
get back on their feet

23:49.562 --> 23:50.561
once they're released.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.829
He offers them a place to stay,

23:51.831 --> 23:53.497
all with
one giant string attached.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.733
He wants...companionship.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.868
- Yeah, well,
quid pro quo, baby.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.603
- All right, well,
Ames was living dangerously,

23:59.605 --> 24:03.707
One of the convicts used him,
forced him to be a drug mule.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.075
- Forced?
You sure about that?

24:05.077 --> 24:07.011
- We found something
interesting.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.479
We've been focusing
on the convict

24:08.481 --> 24:10.581
Ames was most recently
writing to,

24:10.583 --> 24:12.483
a guy named Peter Walker.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.452
The tone of these letters
is different.

24:14.454 --> 24:15.786
He's very...

24:15.788 --> 24:18.222
tender,
and Peter even sent photos.

24:18.224 --> 24:20.090
- Peter Walker's
a small-time con man.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.059
Got popped ripping off
old folks.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.127
Did three years in Stateville.

24:23.129 --> 24:28.632
Patrol officers gave me
an address at 324 E. 8th Street.

24:28.634 --> 24:30.067
- That's Ames apartment.

24:30.069 --> 24:34.972
And his cellmate two years ago
was Johnny Zakarian.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.208
- Find Peter Walker.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.712
- Detective,
the owner of Pure Green Medical

24:41.714 --> 24:43.547
is waiting for you.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.548
- Really?

24:44.550 --> 24:45.983
Playing for the bad guys now?

24:45.985 --> 24:47.051
- At least it's for money.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.652
Olinsky would volunteer.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.188
- Bring me some edibles.

25:00.565 --> 25:02.666
- Hi.
- Jay.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.702
Brianna Logan.
Pleasure.

25:04.704 --> 25:06.871
- Likewise.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.874
- I don't know
what Mouse told you.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.842
- He said
you used to be a lawyer

25:11.844 --> 25:13.711
and now you own a pot shop.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.579
- Well, I like to tell people

25:15.581 --> 25:17.848
that I entered
a budding industry

25:17.850 --> 25:20.251
with growth potential.

25:20.253 --> 25:23.153
- I bet that
always gets a laugh.

25:23.155 --> 25:26.724
- Usually a smile.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.727
Uh, so Mouse
did my security system,

25:29.729 --> 25:32.630
and recommended you
for security detail.

25:32.632 --> 25:33.764
I like ex-cops,

25:33.766 --> 25:35.966
um, ex-military,

25:35.968 --> 25:39.136
preferably ones that
don't scare the customers away.

25:39.138 --> 25:40.971
We're an all-cash business.

25:40.973 --> 25:44.842
The Feds still won't
let us open bank accounts.

25:44.844 --> 25:45.976
- If this were, like,
six months ago

25:45.978 --> 25:48.846
I'd be putting you in handcuffs.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.981
- Times change.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.984
- Yeah, that's what they say.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.954
- Well, if you're interested,
I could use your help tonight.

26:01.660 --> 26:03.561
I have 35 resumes at my desk.

26:03.563 --> 26:06.730
- I'll take it.

26:06.732 --> 26:07.731
- I'll see you tonight.
- Thanks.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.066
- Mm-hmm.

26:16.341 --> 26:20.711
- Okay, we went
to your apartment.

26:20.713 --> 26:24.615
We know what you're hiding.

26:24.617 --> 26:27.751
Question.

26:27.753 --> 26:32.590
Why inmates?

26:32.592 --> 26:36.260
- My life's mission
is social justice.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.662
And...

26:38.664 --> 26:42.032
I started communicating
with inmates

26:42.034 --> 26:45.636
who were serving
unfair sentences,

26:45.638 --> 26:48.138
and I f--

26:48.140 --> 26:51.609
I found out that, uh,

26:51.611 --> 26:53.744
I had so much in common

26:53.746 --> 26:55.913
with these men.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.219
I'm also a misfit.

27:02.221 --> 27:05.122
And a prisoner.

27:05.124 --> 27:09.026
- Yeah, well,

27:09.028 --> 27:12.363
one of these guys set you up.

27:12.365 --> 27:13.364
Was it Peter Walker?

27:13.366 --> 27:15.933
- No, it wasn't Peter's fault.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.267
- We know he was staying
at your apartment.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.403
- It wasn't Peter.

27:19.405 --> 27:21.238
Running drugs was my idea.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.740
I set the whole thing up.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.141
There you have it.
I confess.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.010
- So...

27:26.012 --> 27:29.313
you're saying you knew
Armenian drug dealers.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.049
What, they're former students?

27:32.051 --> 27:33.384
Come on.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.819
Why are you protecting
Peter Walker?

27:39.758 --> 27:41.892
- Peter and I..

27:41.894 --> 27:43.127
Pe--

27:43.129 --> 27:44.662
- You're in love.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.798
- Yes, we are.

27:47.800 --> 27:52.369
- No, the other prisoners,
I helped them.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.138
They helped me.

27:54.140 --> 27:58.308
With Peter, we have a connection

27:58.310 --> 28:02.746
and I never had it
with anybody else.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.348
Peter was very special.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.716
- You know,

28:05.718 --> 28:08.886
according to his rap sheet,

28:08.888 --> 28:10.788
he's a forger and a swindler.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.824
- Yes, and that's the problem.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.693
He left prison
with a price on his head.

28:15.695 --> 28:20.030
A man promised to kill him if he
didn't pay back $50,000 he took.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.031
- And he came to you.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.734
- Of course he did.

28:23.736 --> 28:27.004
We were making plans.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.473
We were gonna
move in together.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.008
I would have--

28:31.010 --> 28:32.876
I would have just taken money
from the trust,

28:32.878 --> 28:36.280
but my wife controls it.

28:36.282 --> 28:40.017
- Luckily, Peter had not only
drug contacts,

28:40.019 --> 28:42.953
but the perfect patsy to run
heroin across the border.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.022
- One time.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.757
To save Peter's life.

28:46.759 --> 28:47.925
I had no choice.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.461
- Mmm.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.896
- [sighs]

28:55.767 --> 28:57.000
Does my wife know?

28:57.002 --> 29:01.972
- First things first.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.107
<i>- Can you imagine?</i>

29:03.109 --> 29:04.241
Like, what is his wife
gonna say?

29:04.243 --> 29:05.275
That's 30 years of marriage.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.811
- Mmm.
- [blows]

29:07.813 --> 29:10.013
- But she knew.

29:10.015 --> 29:11.749
- What do you mean?

29:11.751 --> 29:13.751
- Like, somewhere deep down.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.285
She knew.

29:15.287 --> 29:16.386
So she's gonna kick herself

29:16.388 --> 29:19.356
'cause she ignored
all the signs.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.861
Hey.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.897
That's him.

29:26.899 --> 29:29.199
- Yep.

29:45.216 --> 29:47.017
- Peter Walker.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.018
- Yes?

29:48.020 --> 29:49.553
- Chicago PD.

29:49.555 --> 29:52.456
Need to ask you
a couple of questions.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.061
- I remember when
Chicago cops were ugly.

29:58.063 --> 30:00.397
- How sweet.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.303
you must have thought
you won the lottery, huh?

30:06.305 --> 30:08.238
- Look, he gave me
a place to stay,

30:08.240 --> 30:10.240
but that business
about drugs in his car,

30:10.242 --> 30:12.442
I had nothing
to do with that, okay?

30:12.444 --> 30:14.545
I thought he was giving
a lecture in Canada.

30:14.547 --> 30:19.149
- I just needed a bit of cash
to get back on my feet.

30:19.151 --> 30:22.452
- So the threat on your life was
just a ruse to shake down Ames?

30:22.454 --> 30:24.955
- I thought he was gonna get the
money from his bank accounts.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.257
Not a crime to ask for money.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.326
- No.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.129
You know who else
was looking for some extra cash?

30:32.131 --> 30:35.165
This kid, Michael Perry.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.600
Selling candy.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.102
Knocked on
Johnny Zakarian's door.

30:39.104 --> 30:41.305
Wrong place, wrong time.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.906
Took one to the back
of the head, execution-style.

30:42.908 --> 30:43.907
He was nine years old.

30:43.909 --> 30:45.542
- Look at the picture, man.

30:45.544 --> 30:48.011
- Hmm?

30:48.013 --> 30:50.147
You had a shred of decency
in your heart,

30:50.149 --> 30:53.483
you would tell us who put the
drugs in the professor's trunk.

30:55.620 --> 31:00.324
- Sorry, I can't help you.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.525
- Here.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.597
- You know we know

31:06.599 --> 31:10.968
that you and Johnny Zakarian
were cellmates, right?

31:10.970 --> 31:13.203
Your cellie is dead,

31:13.205 --> 31:15.439
and the man that you're in
a relationship with,

31:15.441 --> 31:17.541
he's facing serious jail time.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.211
You are our only connection.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.913
- If you had any proof,

31:22.915 --> 31:25.482
you wouldn't be asking me
questions.

31:25.484 --> 31:30.454
And let me clarify
my relationship.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.257
I let him cuddle,

31:33.259 --> 31:35.659
but that was it.

31:35.661 --> 31:40.264
- Must be real proud of
the way you played him, hmm?

31:40.266 --> 31:44.434
- What happens when the people
who burned down Johnny Zakarian

31:44.436 --> 31:47.137
find you?

31:47.139 --> 31:50.641
Because we will toss you back
on the street wrapped in a bow.

31:50.643 --> 31:54.011
- That ought to give you a hint.

32:02.186 --> 32:04.321
- So you get anything
off of Walker?

32:04.323 --> 32:06.056
- That guy is a sleazebag,

32:06.058 --> 32:07.324
but he's not copping
to anything.

32:07.326 --> 32:08.926
- All we got so far

32:08.928 --> 32:11.061
is a professor
that we know likes convicts,

32:11.063 --> 32:12.496
and ten keys
of unclaimed heroin.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.264
The State's Attorney
is not going to be happy.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.699
- Sergeant,
you need to hear this.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.401
- Please, I need some help.
- Mrs. Ames.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.102
- They've taken my daughter.
They took Pearl.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.103
- Who took her?

32:20.105 --> 32:22.005
- I don't know.
Someone called.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.074
They said my husband
owed them $100,000

32:24.076 --> 32:27.244
and if I didn't pay them--

32:27.246 --> 32:31.114
They also said they would kill
her if I went to the police.

32:32.717 --> 32:35.285
- Okay.

32:38.723 --> 32:41.224
- Whoever put the heroin
in your car took your daughter.

32:41.226 --> 32:42.459
- This is a nightmare.
- And the clock is ticking.

32:42.461 --> 32:43.627
You need to help us right now.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.195
- Talk to Peter.
He arranged the drugs.

32:45.197 --> 32:46.263
- Peter denies everything,

32:46.265 --> 32:47.698
including his relationship
with you.

32:47.700 --> 32:48.699
- He's probably scared.

32:48.701 --> 32:50.167
- He threw you under the bus.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.335
- He would never do that.

32:51.337 --> 32:53.003
- Professor,
we're running out of time.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.037
- You do not know Peter.

32:54.039 --> 32:55.973
- Peter?

32:55.975 --> 32:58.709
He's a convicted swindler.

32:58.711 --> 33:00.377
He played you from the get-go.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.646
Lonely hearts,
it's the oldest con in the book.

33:02.648 --> 33:03.647
- They are after him.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.282
50 grand or they'll kill him.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.283
- They're gonna
kill your daughter!

33:06.285 --> 33:10.354
Tell him that
my daughter's life is at stake.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.191
- He knows.

33:15.360 --> 33:18.295
He knows.

33:28.606 --> 33:30.640
All right.

33:33.211 --> 33:37.114
Listen to me.

33:37.116 --> 33:39.783
I need you to get me something
that can help us flip Peter.

33:39.785 --> 33:43.587
Some personal detail,
something he cares about,

33:43.589 --> 33:46.123
'cause...

33:46.125 --> 33:48.191
'cause it ain't you.

33:53.331 --> 33:54.431
- [sniffles]

33:54.433 --> 33:57.134
He has a kid brother.

33:57.136 --> 33:59.569
He's a drug addict.

33:59.571 --> 34:04.107
But he has a real
soft spot for him.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.143
Marco.

34:08.279 --> 34:11.547
You're gonna find her, right?

34:11.550 --> 34:14.650
[sobs]

34:22.427 --> 34:24.226
- Who's holding her?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.429
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.600
- Hey, I didn't do anything.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.202
- Marco!

34:32.204 --> 34:34.071
- Peter, what's going on?
They pulled me out of bed.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.338
- Marco, don't worry.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.572
- Wait, why are you here?
What's this about?

34:36.574 --> 34:37.774
- Look, it's got nothing
to do with you, okay?

34:37.775 --> 34:39.176
Don't say anything.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.311
- Peter, help me.
Help me, man!

34:41.313 --> 34:43.112
- My brother's got nothing
to do with this.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.347
- I know.
I know.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.817
I mean, that poor kid, though.

34:46.819 --> 34:48.784
He can't stay out of trouble.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.221
Two strikes against him, right?

34:51.223 --> 34:55.358
You know what I got here?

34:55.360 --> 34:56.460
Strike three.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.395
- Oh, no, no.
You can't do this.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.497
- I'll tell you what I can do.

35:00.499 --> 35:02.866
I can put this back in evidence,

35:02.868 --> 35:05.102
or I can put it in the back
of your brother's truck,

35:05.104 --> 35:07.804
and when we find it there,

35:07.806 --> 35:12.142
that's a one-way ticket
to Stateville.

35:12.144 --> 35:14.344
- Hey, man.
Don't look at me.

35:14.346 --> 35:16.246
- So...

35:16.248 --> 35:18.582
last chance.

35:21.519 --> 35:25.422
Who took the girl?

35:25.424 --> 35:29.626
- Johnny Zakarian
had this friend, Gregor.

35:29.628 --> 35:31.495
He took me to meet his boss.

35:31.497 --> 35:34.331
The guy that supplied the drugs.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.900
- Give me a name.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.136
- Gaspar.
Scary dude, okay?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.770
I met him
at a construction site,

35:40.772 --> 35:42.772
and that photo you showed me,

35:42.774 --> 35:45.542
the girl's in his trailer.

35:59.290 --> 36:02.759
<i>[phone ringing]</i>

36:02.761 --> 36:03.927
- Hello.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.395
-  <i>Do you have the money?</i>

36:05.397 --> 36:07.731
- <i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

36:13.204 --> 36:14.938
- I got three guards.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.676
Hostage is in the trailer.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.780
- <i>You put the money</i>
<i>in the paper bag</i>

36:23.782 --> 36:26.917
<i>and take it to the</i>
<i>Picasso statue in Daley Plaza.</i>

36:26.919 --> 36:29.252
<i>Be there in one hour.</i>

36:29.254 --> 36:32.255
- I can't.
I mean, I need more time.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.691
- <i>Why?</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

36:34.693 --> 36:37.894
- I'm--I'm--

36:37.896 --> 36:39.796
- <i>You're not home.</i>

36:39.798 --> 36:43.266
- No--yes, yes, I'm in back.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.535
-  <i>You're lying.</i>
<i>You went to the police.</i>

36:45.537 --> 36:47.637
- No.
- <i>You went to the police.</i>

36:47.639 --> 36:48.772
<i>They're with you right now.</i>

36:48.774 --> 36:51.908
- Please, I just
want my daughter back.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.244
- <i>I told you I'd kill her.</i>

36:54.246 --> 36:56.646
- No!
No!

36:56.648 --> 37:00.250
- Get in, now.

37:00.252 --> 37:02.986
-  <i>Sarge,</i>
<i>Gaspar cut off the call.</i>

37:02.988 --> 37:04.654
- We go in now.
Let's go.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.489
- Moving.

37:15.900 --> 37:18.401
Gun!
Drop your weapon!

37:18.403 --> 37:20.637
[gunshots]

37:21.906 --> 37:23.406
Move.
- Yeah.

37:25.543 --> 37:26.543
- Alvin!

37:26.545 --> 37:28.745
[gunfire]

37:28.747 --> 37:30.747
- Crossing.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.717
[gunfire]

37:35.786 --> 37:38.321
Glass!

37:38.323 --> 37:41.258
- Hit it!
Hit it!

37:41.260 --> 37:42.759
[small explosion]

37:43.794 --> 37:45.629
Go, go!

37:45.631 --> 37:47.731
Don't move.

37:52.837 --> 37:54.304
- You're okay.

37:54.306 --> 37:55.939
Shh, shh, it's okay.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.540
Easy.
- [whimpers]

37:57.542 --> 37:58.541
- It's okay.

37:58.543 --> 38:01.511
- [sobs]

38:01.513 --> 38:03.947
- I got you, it's okay.

38:08.686 --> 38:12.922
- Your wife is coming and
she's bringing your medication,

38:12.924 --> 38:16.393
and you don't understand
a word I'm saying, do you?

38:16.395 --> 38:18.061
- [speaking Spanish]

38:18.063 --> 38:21.865
Right, yeah, we're speaking
the same language.

38:21.867 --> 38:23.533
- Gustavo.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.569
Gustavo.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.338
-  <i>Mi amor.</i>

38:29.740 --> 38:31.675
- Hey, Sarge.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.743
Tell me, how'd you know
that guy wasn't homeless?

38:33.745 --> 38:34.944
- At roll call this morning,

38:34.946 --> 38:36.946
they announced that
a businessman from Madrid

38:36.948 --> 38:37.947
had gone missing.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.616
I guess you missed that.

38:39.618 --> 38:42.385
Plus, he was wearing
fine leather shoes,

38:42.387 --> 38:44.821
not the kind you see
on a homeless man.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.892
Always pay attention
to the shoes.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.737
- How much trouble is he in?

39:00.739 --> 39:05.075
- Transporting that much heroin
is a Class X felony.

39:05.077 --> 39:06.743
He's a cooperating witness,

39:06.745 --> 39:10.080
so that'll be taken into
consideration,

39:10.082 --> 39:13.550
but a little boy died because
of what your dad did.

39:13.552 --> 39:17.654
He's gonna have to
pay the price.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.823
- My father always said
we had to take responsibility

39:19.825 --> 39:24.060
for our actions.

39:24.062 --> 39:27.464
Can I see him?

39:27.466 --> 39:30.400
- He knows that you know.

39:35.473 --> 39:38.641
- Pearl.

39:38.643 --> 39:41.111
I'm so sorry.

39:43.547 --> 39:45.548
- [sobs]

39:48.953 --> 39:50.553
[sobbing]

39:50.555 --> 39:52.756
- Shh.

40:01.699 --> 40:04.100
- What do you think?

40:04.102 --> 40:06.102
- Always wanted
to work on a farm.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.104
- [chuckles]

40:08.106 --> 40:10.407
I'm working late too.

40:13.444 --> 40:15.845
I'll be in my office
if you need anything.

40:22.620 --> 40:24.954
- [sighs]

40:24.956 --> 40:27.424
- You're the new security guy?

40:27.426 --> 40:30.760
- Yeah.

40:30.762 --> 40:35.098
My unit burned fields of poppy
in Kandahar.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.566
- Army?
- Marines.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.567
Three tours.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.702
- Wow, Rangers.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.504
- Egan.
- Halstead.

40:41.506 --> 40:43.807
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

40:43.809 --> 40:44.808
It's crazy, huh?

40:44.810 --> 40:46.109
- Yeah.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.078
Want to know something crazy?

40:49.080 --> 40:51.114
I just got out of rehab.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.483
Shh.

40:53.485 --> 40:55.718
[both chuckle]

40:55.720 --> 40:56.853
[laughter]

40:56.855 --> 40:58.188
- So the mild-mannered
professor's

40:58.190 --> 41:00.657
going to Stateville
for ten years.

41:00.659 --> 41:03.560
- Yeah, for his own protection,
so his wife won't kill him.

41:03.562 --> 41:05.195
- I feel sorry for the guy.

41:05.197 --> 41:06.229
I mean, he didn't know
how to accept himself

41:06.231 --> 41:08.164
and he lost everything.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.566
- I don't know,
I think what took him down

41:09.568 --> 41:10.900
were his secrets, right?

41:10.902 --> 41:12.869
He lied to the word.
He lied to his family.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.504
He paid the price.

41:14.506 --> 41:18.107
I--I think what took him down
was love.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.843
- But I thought
you said it was all a con.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.644
I mean, it wasn't real love.

41:21.646 --> 41:24.013
- But to him it was real.

41:24.015 --> 41:26.716
The things he was willing to do
for that guy.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.786
Love makes us do crazy things.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.588
We know we can't control it,

41:31.590 --> 41:34.524
and we spend our whole lives
chasing it, and...

41:34.526 --> 41:37.260
[phone vibrating]

41:37.262 --> 41:38.261
- Bye-bye.

41:38.263 --> 41:40.263
- Hey, babe.

41:40.265 --> 41:43.566
You have the munchies yet?

41:43.568 --> 41:45.034
Hold on.

41:45.036 --> 41:47.036
Don't leave that anywhere.

41:56.780 --> 42:00.216
I just lost one.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.851
- Okay.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.954
[laughter]
