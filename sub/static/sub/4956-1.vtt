Why'd they still chase the toy car?

It's not that expensive.

47:47.809 --> 47:50.770
I'm sure they don't have
enough time to play with it.

Where'd you find it?

48:27.849 --> 48:31.853

for shoveling snow for Mrs. Hess.

under a magnifying glass to see.

"Air Force" written on it.

to give to the right guys?
