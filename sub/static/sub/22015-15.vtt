WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:06.140
.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.075
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:07.708 --> 00:09.377
sexually based offenses

00:09.410 --> 00:11.545
are considered
especially heinous.

00:11.579 --> 00:14.248
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.282 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.485
are members of an elite squad

00:17.518 --> 00:19.553
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.422
These are their stories.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.758
- Case 1708.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.827
The complainant is Mia Marino,

00:26.860 --> 00:29.663
the alleged perpetrator,
Ethan Hartley.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.365
- Respondent.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.134
- Not perpetrator.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.169
Respondent.

00:36.304 --> 00:39.207
- Respondent.
Ethan Hartley.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.375
Mia, can you tell the tribunal
what happened

00:41.409 --> 00:45.045
on the night
of December 9, 2017?

00:46.714 --> 00:51.152
- Ethan and I ran into each
other at a party on campus.

00:52.853 --> 00:55.456
We both had a lot to drink.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.593
We decided to go back
to my dorm.

01:00.694 --> 01:02.463
And, um...

01:02.496 --> 01:03.697
- Hold on.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.166
What are you telling me,
Teresa?

01:05.199 --> 01:07.201
That

01:07.235 --> 01:09.570
When?
- December.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.571
She was drunk,
woke up,

01:10.604 --> 01:12.240
boy was on top of her.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.175
It was a mess.
A complete mess.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.744
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.246
- The university's handling it.

01:18.279 --> 01:19.447
There's a hearing right now.

01:19.480 --> 01:20.814
Mia didn't want
the police involved.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.416
- Mia didn't want
the police involved?

01:22.450 --> 01:24.485
She's 18 years old, Teresa.
You should have called me.

01:24.518 --> 01:25.653
- I'm trying to trust
her judgment.

01:25.686 --> 01:26.887
Be a better parent.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.390
Mom and Dad?

01:29.423 --> 01:32.360
Does--does Tony know
about this?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.661
- No.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.464
It's not like we talk.
We're divorced 15 years.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.865
- He's still Mia's father,
Teresa.

01:37.898 --> 01:38.866
And I'm her uncle.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.202
I'm a cop, for God's sake.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.204
Where is this hearing?
Is it somewhere on campus?

01:43.237 --> 01:44.472
- I don't want you
making things worse.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.639
- Then why'd you even
call me?

01:45.673 --> 01:47.675
- Because...

01:47.708 --> 01:49.143
I'm scared to death.

01:49.177 --> 01:50.611
They don't let parents in.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.214
Mia's alone, talking about
being sexually assaulted

01:53.247 --> 01:55.483
in a room full of strangers.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.117
- I'm here now.

01:59.853 --> 02:02.223
So who is this bastard?

02:02.256 --> 02:04.558
- We were sitting on her bed.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.793
We were kissing.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.829
We were both kissing.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.865
- She didn't pull away.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.534
She kissed me back.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.269
- And then you had
sexual contact

02:15.303 --> 02:17.405
that was not consensual.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.542
- I don't remember.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.944
But I--I'm sure I'd never
rape anyone.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.180
- Dean Baldwin,
you skipped one

02:26.214 --> 02:27.248
of the submitted questions.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.251
- In Ms. Marino's
initial statement,

02:30.284 --> 02:31.652
she claims she didn't consent,

02:31.685 --> 02:34.522
but later she said
she didn't remember.

02:34.555 --> 02:38.592
- Mia, did you or did you not
give affirmative consent?

02:40.328 --> 02:41.729
- Go ahead and answer, Mia.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.331
Tell them what you told me.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.167
- No, I did not.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.671
- Having reviewed the evidence,

02:50.704 --> 02:52.873
I am ready to make
my determination.

02:52.906 --> 02:57.278
I find the respondent,
Ethan Hartley, responsible.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.248
- Subject to suspension
for one year,

03:00.281 --> 03:01.815
effective immediately.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.418
You need to pack your dorm
and vacate school property

03:04.452 --> 03:05.753
by 5:00 p.m. today.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.921
- No, but--but I didn't--

03:07.955 --> 03:09.423
you bitch.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.259
What--what--
what is she saying?

03:11.292 --> 03:13.761
You--you can't do this to me!

03:15.463 --> 03:17.565
This can't be happening!

03:19.633 --> 03:21.402
- Hey, Mia's here.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.637
Hey, what happened?
- Mom, Uncle Sonny--

03:23.671 --> 03:24.872
- Oh, hey, it's okay.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.307
- No, it's not.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.609
They suspended him
for a year.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.278
He was so angry.

03:30.311 --> 03:32.012
He yelled and--

03:32.045 --> 03:33.814
and he threatened me.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.319
- I'll take care of this.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.820
- What I would have done
in the first place.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.856
Open up a police investigation
and arrest this son of a bitch.

03:49.297 --> 03:56.504
*

04:33.574 --> 04:35.576
This case is complicated,

04:35.609 --> 04:36.744
and we just want to make sure

04:36.777 --> 04:37.911
that we're not missing
anything.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.615
- The sexual assault happened
three months ago

04:41.649 --> 04:42.883
at Hudson University.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.918
The victim never went
to the police.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.420
It was handled internally
by the school.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.655
- So there's no rape kit.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.423
You know,
untrained investigators,

04:49.457 --> 04:50.891
but Hudson University

04:50.924 --> 04:52.593
did find the male student
responsible.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.094
- The guy was only suspended.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.796
For a year.
And he made threats.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.731
I think he's a danger
to the victim.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.805
Who, full disclosure,
is, um...

05:04.838 --> 05:06.940
She's my 18-year-old niece.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.343
- Good to know.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.344
Anything else?

05:10.378 --> 05:12.513
- Yeah, I believe her.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.081
And the school did too.

05:14.114 --> 05:14.915
- Okay.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.650
But despite Betsy DeVos,

05:16.684 --> 05:19.052
New York's "Enough Is Enough"
law is still on the books?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.454
- It is.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.855
- Under Title IX,
the school only needs

05:21.889 --> 05:23.457
preponderance of evidence
to convict.

05:23.491 --> 05:24.792
The state needs
beyond a reasonable doubt.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.594
We understand that.
- Good.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.028
I've heard enough.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.031
You're leaving?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.566
- I'm going to get you
a subpoena

05:32.600 --> 05:34.001
for the tribunal transcripts.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.803
It's a start until you can
get me enough evidence

05:35.836 --> 05:37.037
to charge rape.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.375
Lieutenant.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.977
Detective Carisi, I'm sorry for
what happened to your niece.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.851
- So is this where you tell me
I'm off the case?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.553
- Officially, yes.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.526
And unofficially...

06:00.561 --> 06:02.530
Don't screw it up.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.833
- Thank you, Lieutenant.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.569
- Counselor.
- Hey, Detective.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.638
I spoke with Antonio Dawson
this morning.

06:10.671 --> 06:11.839
He sends his regards.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.173
- Okay, that's my man.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.509
Tell him I said hi.
- I'll do that.

06:20.948 --> 06:22.883
- He seems like an okay dude.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.918
- I think he should go back
to Chicago.

06:26.454 --> 06:30.190
- It's not his fault Barba
pulled the plug on that baby.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.592
Just saying.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.798
- Lieutenant Benson,

06:37.831 --> 06:39.166
it's so nice to meet you.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.801
Sonny thinks the world of you.
- Stop.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.135
- Well, the feeling's mutual.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.671
- I guess so,
getting involved with this.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.038
You must be so busy.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.175
- Well, I just hope
I can help your daughter.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.843
So, Mia, uh,

06:49.877 --> 06:51.679
can I talk to you alone?

06:51.712 --> 06:54.448
- It happened three months ago.
Isn't it too late for this?

06:54.482 --> 06:55.583
- No, it's not.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.751
Just tell Lieutenant Benson
the truth.

06:57.785 --> 07:00.153
Whatever you can remember.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.022
- Okay.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.096
I didn't know Ethan that well.

07:09.129 --> 07:11.965
He was more friends
with my roommate, Renata.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.201
- Uh-huh.
- But I invited him to my room.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.637
- That's okay, that's okay.
I'm gonna--

07:16.670 --> 07:17.738
- Yeah, that's fine.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.107
- So, Mia,
why don't you tell me

07:20.140 --> 07:21.642
what you do remember, okay?

07:21.675 --> 07:23.577
- Okay.
- Just tell me what happened.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.878
- Um...

07:26.847 --> 07:29.149
Well, we--we sat on my bed.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.085
We kissed a few times.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.689
And--and then he just--

07:35.723 --> 07:38.859
he just got on top of me.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.929
I could--
I could feel him.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.899
He was, um, ready.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.538
- No.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.073
It happened so fast.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.743
He put his tongue in my mouth.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.010
I was choking.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.513
I pushed him away, but...

07:59.547 --> 08:01.749
but before I knew
what was happening,

08:01.782 --> 08:03.183
he was inside me.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.620
- Okay.

08:06.654 --> 08:10.257
So, Mia, did you--
did you actually say no?

08:12.593 --> 08:14.695
- I--I think so.

08:18.065 --> 08:23.070
I definitely said, "Wait,"
and I pushed him off me.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.672
And then he just--

08:24.705 --> 08:27.941
he got all mad,
and he just left.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.580
- Well, if you didn't consent,

08:32.613 --> 08:34.982
then that is rape.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.022
- You're saying my son
might be arrested?

08:42.055 --> 08:44.157
He didn't rape her.
He was railroaded.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.959
- We just want to ask
a few questions.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.896
- I told you,
her uncle is a cop.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.831
- We're not making
any prejudgments.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.199
We just want to hear
Ethan's side.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.801
- He told the school.
They didn't listen.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.968
They suspended him.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.605
He had to pack up
his dorm room.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.271
He's banned from campus.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.640
He can't even go to class.

08:59.673 --> 09:00.908
- We're going to appeal,
believe me.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.242
- Well, we have to let you know

09:02.275 --> 09:04.678
this is now an open
police investigation.

09:04.712 --> 09:05.946
- We'll be calling
a lawyer this time.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.314
- This is crazy.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.082
I--I didn't even want
to hook up with Mia.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.250
I only went to her room because

09:10.283 --> 09:11.785
I thought Renata
would be there.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.054
- Mia's roommate.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.189
- Stop talking, Ethan, now.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.726
And you two can leave.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.833
- They're his parents.
What do you expect them to say?

09:25.866 --> 09:28.068
I think we should
talk to the roommate

09:28.101 --> 09:29.803
and call Carisi.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.007
- It's his niece.
I'm calling him.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.876
- I was shocked to hear
what Ethan did.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.344
This is so horrible for Mia.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.379
- Renata, when did she tell you
what had happened?

09:39.412 --> 09:40.247
- The next day.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.715
No, the day after.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.784
I was skiing in Vermont
with my parents.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.218
- Yeah.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.954
And our RA, Hillary,

09:46.987 --> 09:49.089
told me that Ethan had been
in the dorm.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.158
She saw him and Mia
kissing in the hall.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.762
- Okay, so what exactly
did Mia tell you?

09:54.795 --> 09:57.998
- Well, I asked her what Ethan
was even doing in our room.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.266
And then she just
started crying,

09:59.299 --> 10:01.802
and she said she didn't
want to have sex,

10:01.835 --> 10:03.236
and he had forced her.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.405
- Okay, so after you asked her
about Ethan,

10:05.438 --> 10:07.407
that's when she told you
she was raped?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.710
- Yeah.

10:09.743 --> 10:11.779
I can't believe I ever
went out with him.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.647
I thought he was one
of the nice guys.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.782
Nontoxic.

10:16.216 --> 10:17.317
I'm sorry,
I have to get to class.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.219
- Yeah.
- Sure, thank you.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.421
So Mia didn't disclose
to her roommate

10:21.454 --> 10:23.356
until after she was asked
about Ethan.

10:24.692 --> 10:27.294
- Well, so--I don't--
maybe nothing.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.929
Or...

10:28.962 --> 10:31.331
What--what, are you saying you
think my niece made this up?

10:31.364 --> 10:33.166
- No, that's not
what I'm saying.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.202
But you know, we both know
that these cases

10:35.235 --> 10:36.737
are not black and white.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.138
They're--they're kids.
They're immature.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.439
Sexually inexperienced.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.309
And you throw drinking
into the mix?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.411
- What are you--
what are you saying?

10:46.379 --> 10:50.150
- I'm saying we need to take
a look at the tribunal tapes.

10:53.954 --> 10:56.857
- I saw Ethan and Mia
in the hall.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.091
They were making out.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.927
- Hillary Baker.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.062
She's the resident advisor
in Mia's dorm.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.431
- She saw Mia and Ethan
together.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.234
- Ethan was pretty aggressive.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.269
They were in the room
with the door closed

11:09.302 --> 11:10.938
for about an hour.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.441
- Did you hear her say no
or call for help?

11:14.474 --> 11:15.342
- No.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.343
But when Ethan left,

11:16.376 --> 11:17.344
I went to Mia's door.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.212
I asked if she was okay.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.015
She said she needed a minute,
so I went back to my room.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.284
- Did she tell you
at any point that night

11:24.317 --> 11:25.953
that she had been assaulted?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.320
- No.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.089
But maybe she told
Andy Rayburn,

11:29.122 --> 11:30.758
her neighbor in the dorm.

11:30.791 --> 11:34.094
I saw him leaving her room
the next morning.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.198
- No.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.000
At least, not to me.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.401
- Find out why.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.307
- Usually campus police
handle noise complaints.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.176
- We're just here
to talk to Andy.

11:51.311 --> 11:53.246
It's this one.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.950
- NYPD.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.291
- Hey, hi.
Who are these guys?

12:04.324 --> 12:07.260
- We're the police.
- That sucks.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.863
- We want to talk to you
about Mia Morino.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.867
Why, is she saying
that I raped her too?

12:13.901 --> 12:17.437
*

12:21.174 --> 12:21.341
.

12:21.374 --> 12:21.708
- Mia texted me.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.344
She said she was, um, depressed

12:24.377 --> 12:25.345
and needed to talk.

12:27.114 --> 12:29.082
- Uh, how she was
a terrible person.

12:29.116 --> 12:31.518
That this was all her fault.
I don't--

12:31.551 --> 12:33.020
- Okay, well,
did she talk about Ethan,

12:33.053 --> 12:35.255
or did she say
that she was assaulted?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.325
- No.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.559
- Then why'd you ask us

12:39.592 --> 12:41.294
if Mia said you raped her too?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.831
- My client did nothing wrong,
okay?

12:43.864 --> 12:45.065
We're here to cooperate.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.099
- Okay.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.368
Cooperate.
Answer the question.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.103
- I didn't rape Mia.

12:50.137 --> 12:51.371
We just stayed up
all night talking.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.906
I only asked you guys this

12:52.940 --> 12:54.942
because I heard
she was accusing Ethan.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.376
Okay? You guys said
you were the police,

12:56.409 --> 12:57.978
so I freaked out.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.914
- But why didn't you tell
the university investigator

13:00.948 --> 13:02.850
that you'd been with Mia?

13:02.883 --> 13:05.152
- Because nobody asked me.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.087
Like, I don't know
that she wasn't raped.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.991
- Obviously, if he knew that,
he would have come forward.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.126
- Maybe Mia just
didn't want to tell me.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.128
Maybe she was just waiting
to tweet "Me too" about it

13:15.162 --> 13:17.130
or--or write a short story
for "The New Yorker."

13:17.164 --> 13:18.465
I don't...

13:20.167 --> 13:23.336
I--I used to think
that I understood girls.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.273
I did, but nobody understands
girls anymore.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.541
Like, at all.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.010
- Like Andy said,
none of this means

13:30.043 --> 13:31.378
that Mia wasn't assaulted.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.180
- Another male student
spent the night in her room?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.848
Don't you think that's something
she should have mentioned?

13:34.882 --> 13:35.949
- It's not uncommon
for a victim

13:35.983 --> 13:37.284
to leave out part of her story.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.852
- She was probably embarrassed.
- Okay.

13:38.886 --> 13:39.920
Okay, fair enough.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.221
- You haven't prosecuted a lot

13:41.254 --> 13:43.556
of college-age assaults,
have you?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.325
- Actually, none.

13:45.358 --> 13:49.062
- Okay, so it's rarely
a clean narrative, right?

13:49.096 --> 13:50.563
There can be alcohol involved.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.532
The victim can feel conflicted.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.901
There can be memory loss.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.235
It's--there's self-blame.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.303
It's complicated.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.638
- Okay.
I'll follow your lead.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.007
You'll follow up with Mia?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.042
- Yes, and the RA
and the roommate.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.310
- Listen, don't worry.
We get it.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.045
You need a case
you can prosecute.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.346
- I also need a case
that won't bounce

14:06.379 --> 14:07.447
on a motion to dismiss.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.581
And it wouldn't be a bad idea

14:08.615 --> 14:09.917
to talk to Hudson's
investigator.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.284
- Okay, we're on it.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.324
- He's on a learning curve.
That's--that's great.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.226
- Look,
Stone's a good prosecutor.

14:19.259 --> 14:21.361
- Yeah, maybe in Chicago when
he's dealing with homicides.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.629
But he's in sex crimes now.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.998
It--it's a different world.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.067
- I'm sure that he's aware.

14:29.036 --> 14:32.139
- I didn't tell you about Andy
because...

14:32.172 --> 14:33.941
Because I thought I'd seem
like a slut, okay?

14:33.974 --> 14:37.210
- Okay.
I understand that.

14:37.244 --> 14:40.047
But, Mia, you told Andy
that this was your fault,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.614
and you know
that it's not, right?

14:41.648 --> 14:42.649
- No, it is.

14:42.682 --> 14:44.151
I invited him into my room.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.319
- It doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does!

14:47.220 --> 14:49.089
My whole life,
I have tried to be good,

14:49.122 --> 14:51.058
to make people happy,
like my mother.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.461
To--to say what they
wanted to hear.

14:54.494 --> 14:55.895
- Mia...

14:56.729 --> 14:58.665
Mia, what are you saying?

15:04.037 --> 15:06.639
Are you saying that you...

15:06.673 --> 15:08.041
that you told Ethan what--

15:08.075 --> 15:10.343
what you thought
he wanted to hear?

15:11.678 --> 15:13.180
Hmm?

15:15.082 --> 15:17.317
I don't remember.
Okay?

15:17.350 --> 15:18.952
I don't remember.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.026
I don't want to go to trial.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.163
I let my uncle Sonny down.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.265
I never should have told him
anything.

15:35.302 --> 15:41.241
*

15:41.274 --> 15:42.675
- You saying
you don't believe her?

15:42.709 --> 15:44.677
- No, I do.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.146
But a jury might not.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.947
- This boy raped her.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.453
What am I supposed
to tell Mia now?

15:55.422 --> 15:56.756
Thanks for nothing,
Lieutenant.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.325
- Hey, Teresa.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.762
Sorry, my sister's very...
Italian.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.232
- Look, her daughter did
go through a trauma.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.505
- I'm not sure what happened
in that dorm room was assault,

16:12.539 --> 16:13.740
and I'm--

16:13.773 --> 16:16.309
I don't think she's so sure,
either.

16:17.477 --> 16:21.181
She--she's not gonna make
a convincing witness, Carisi.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.117
Because she left out parts
of her story?

16:24.151 --> 16:25.385
Victims do that all the time.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.187
The--the school found
this kid responsible.

16:27.220 --> 16:30.257
- And unless they know
something that we don't,

16:30.290 --> 16:32.492
we may not have a case.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.263
- We're supposed to be happy

16:36.296 --> 16:38.198
'cause the DA's
not filing charges?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.267
- We wanted to let you know
in person.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.435
- We know.
Now you can go.

16:42.469 --> 16:45.338
- Wait.
Did that girl admit she lied?

16:45.372 --> 16:47.474
- No, no, we're not saying
that she lied.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.142
Just that we don't have
enough evidence

16:49.176 --> 16:50.743
to pursue a criminal case.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.213
- Mom, what difference
does it make?

16:53.246 --> 16:54.314
- The police don't have enough.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.449
Maybe the school
will reconsider.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.717
Can you tell them?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.620
- They--they already said that
you're entitled to an appeal.

17:00.653 --> 17:01.721
- I don't want to go
back there.

17:01.754 --> 17:02.722
Everybody thinks I'm a rapist.

17:02.755 --> 17:03.756
- Don't say that, honey.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.225
- I can't go back to Hudson,

17:05.258 --> 17:06.259
and no other school
will accept me

17:06.293 --> 17:08.128
when they find out why I left.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.531
You were so proud of your son,
the future doctor.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.400
Well, that's not happening.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.436
You should get used to it.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.444
- What do you mean,
he's not being charged?

17:24.477 --> 17:26.513
- Teresa, I know
it's not the best outcome,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.481
but the DA doesn't think
we have enough evidence

17:28.515 --> 17:29.716
to go to trial.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.320
He threatened her!

17:33.353 --> 17:35.155
What are you doing
to protect her?

17:35.188 --> 17:37.190
- We can get
a restraining order.

17:37.224 --> 17:40.560
I want him in prison.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.398
Why'd you get involved
if you couldn't help?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.316
Mia, I'm sorry.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.453
You gonna be okay?

18:07.787 --> 18:09.389
- Yeah.

18:11.391 --> 18:14.494
Uncle Sonny, I don't want
Ethan going to prison

18:14.527 --> 18:16.696
or a restraining order
or anything like that.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.830
- Mia, he threatened you.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.533
- Yeah, but he was upset.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.877
Mia, what's going on?

18:35.348 --> 18:39.152
- What--what Ethan did...

18:39.186 --> 18:41.888
He moved too fast,
and I wasn't ready.

18:44.224 --> 18:45.658
I didn't want to...

18:52.499 --> 18:54.367
I said yes.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.606
And then Renata was asking me
about him,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.174
and I didn't want her
to be mad,

19:01.208 --> 19:02.609
so I told her he raped me.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.876
And then she went to the RA,

19:03.910 --> 19:05.345
and then the school
got involved.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.713
And then I couldn't
take it back.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.747
I'm sorry.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.382
- Hold on.
Hold on.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.762
Are you--are you telling me
that you lied?

19:22.795 --> 19:24.197
To the school?
To the police?

19:24.231 --> 19:25.265
Do you know how serious
this is?

19:25.298 --> 19:27.500
- I'm sorry!
- Mia!

19:27.534 --> 19:29.869
It's not me
you should be apologizing to.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.571
It's Ethan.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.641
- I didn't--I never thought
things would go this far.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.377
I never thought he'd get
kicked out of school.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.514
I'm sorry.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.650
I ruined his life.
I don't know what to do.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.720
You make this right.
That's--that's what you do.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.289
Do you understand me?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.260
- Okay.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.663
- Okay, listen.
Listen.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.931
You made a mistake.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.368
I get it.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.536
But you can fix this.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.771
All right?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.573
You can make this right.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.777
It's gonna be okay.

20:11.744 --> 20:18.785
*

20:19.719 --> 20:22.289
- Just because Stone doesn't
think we have enough evidence,

20:22.322 --> 20:24.424
we can keep investigating.

20:24.457 --> 20:25.692
- Yeah.
Yeah, maybe.

20:25.725 --> 20:26.993
Um...

20:27.026 --> 20:28.561
Either way,
my sister's probably never

20:28.595 --> 20:29.962
gonna speak to me again.

20:29.996 --> 20:30.963
- You were just trying
to help her out.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.432
She's got to know that.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.435
- Well, you've obviously
never met my sister.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.670
Hello?

20:37.704 --> 20:39.406
Mia.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.641
Hold on.
What happened?

20:42.842 --> 20:45.011
All right, stay where you are.
I--I'm on my way.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.013
- She won't tell me.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.748
- I'm coming with you.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.019
- She was raped again.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.288
By who?
- She won't tell me.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.461
- Okay, Mia, let--
let's get you to a hospital.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.730
- I need to talk to you.
Alone.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.367
- Yeah, Renata,
let's step outside.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.073
- I tried to make it right.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.343
I--I asked Ethan to come over.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.645
I apologized.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.783
But he said it was too late.

21:25.051 --> 21:27.787
He pushed me on the bed and...

21:29.656 --> 21:31.524
He raped me.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.367
When it was over, he said,

21:40.400 --> 21:43.470
"Now you know what rape
really feels like."

21:47.440 --> 21:49.842
I tried to do what you said,
Uncle Sonny.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.511
I--I tried, I really did.

21:51.544 --> 21:53.380
- I know, I know.
I know you did, I know.

21:53.413 --> 21:55.782
- And now nobody
will believe me.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.787
Yes, they will.
Yes, they will.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.054
Because--

22:02.088 --> 22:03.623
because we are not
gonna say anything

22:03.656 --> 22:05.758
about what really happened
the first time.

22:09.729 --> 22:10.797
Do you understand?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.832
We're not gonna say anything,
okay?

22:18.104 --> 22:19.806
I'm sorry.

22:33.520 --> 22:33.820
.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.054
- The only reason we're here is
because my client is innocent.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.090
He wants to clear his name.
- We're listening.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.091
- I didn't rape Mia.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.159
We had sex.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.662
- So you expect us to believe
she had consensual sex

22:42.695 --> 22:44.397
with a guy who assaulted her
three months ago.

22:44.431 --> 22:45.698
- I didn't rape her before,
either.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.401
She's setting me up.

22:49.702 --> 22:50.870
- Well, the university
believed her.

22:50.903 --> 22:51.938
They suspended you.

22:51.971 --> 22:53.406
Why would she set you up?

22:53.440 --> 22:54.707
- I don't know.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.676
She was pissed
I didn't go to prison?

22:56.709 --> 22:59.111
Look, I'm telling you,
this whole thing was a setup.

22:59.145 --> 22:59.879
She texted me.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.681
Asked me to come
to her dorm room.

23:01.714 --> 23:05.051
- So you were alone
behind closed doors

23:05.084 --> 23:06.986
with a girl
who made accusations?

23:07.019 --> 23:09.422
- My client's an idiot.
He's no rapist.

23:09.456 --> 23:10.790
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.792
- She said she wanted
to have sex with me.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.026
That she felt bad.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.128
- Oh, so this is
apology sex now?

23:16.162 --> 23:19.131
- You know, I'm not sensing
a whole lot of goodwill here.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.099
- I'm new to SVU.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.435
But I get that no one
just confesses to rape.

23:22.469 --> 23:25.104
It's too easy to deny
or say she wanted it.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.939
What I'm waiting to hear
is a version of the story

23:26.973 --> 23:28.975
that makes me believe you
over her.

23:29.008 --> 23:29.976
And frankly,
that's not happening.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.112
- I want the truth.
You were angry.

23:33.145 --> 23:34.447
You wanted revenge.
I get that.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.582
You made a mistake

23:35.615 --> 23:36.716
and did something
you now regret.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.118
- All right, nice try.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.721
If he's not under arrest,
let's go.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.556
- He's not under arrest.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.057
- For now.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.031
- No.

23:52.064 --> 23:54.601
But after Mia couldn't remember
the first assault,

23:54.634 --> 23:56.135
the jury might not believe her.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.107
Thanks for meeting me.
- Absolutely.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.743
I, uh, I can't stay for dinner.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.177
All right, thank you.

24:06.646 --> 24:08.781
- Look, what you do--

24:08.815 --> 24:10.483
working full-time
as a lieutenant

24:10.517 --> 24:11.884
and being a single mother--

24:11.918 --> 24:14.554
that must take more energy
than I can imagine.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.689
And you--what I mean is,

24:16.723 --> 24:17.990
you make it look effortless.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.826
- Okay, you don't
have to flatter me.

24:19.859 --> 24:21.728
- I'm just telling you
how I see it.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.530
- Okay.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.198
Carisi's niece is telling
the truth.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.868
Uh, she may have been unclear
the first time,

24:28.901 --> 24:30.637
but the second time,

24:30.670 --> 24:31.771
I believe her.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.039
- I do too.

24:33.072 --> 24:35.241
But she's still
an imperfect witness.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.112
- Welcome to sex crimes.

24:40.146 --> 24:43.182
Look, Stone,
there are no perfect witnesses.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.717
They leave out part
of the story.

24:44.751 --> 24:46.018
They can't remember.

24:46.052 --> 24:48.287
They feel guilty,
change their minds.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.922
They blame themself.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.924
They think it's their fault.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.527
But that's why we're here.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.895
To fight for them.

24:55.928 --> 24:57.897
And the less perfect they are,

24:57.930 --> 25:00.533
the harder we fight.

25:00.567 --> 25:04.537
Look, nobody asks a robbery
or a homicide victim

25:04.571 --> 25:06.272
if she wanted it.

25:06.305 --> 25:09.776
Nobody says, "Hey, why was she
walking down the dark alley?

25:09.809 --> 25:11.243
Why was she wearing
the dark skirt?"

25:11.277 --> 25:15.114
Nobody implies that the crime
was somehow her fault.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.749
- I'm just used
to having more evidence

25:16.783 --> 25:17.817
before I go to trial.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.852
- You have the victim's word.

25:21.988 --> 25:26.192
We go to trial so the victim--
the survivor--

25:26.225 --> 25:28.661
can look her rapist in the eye

25:28.695 --> 25:30.997
and tell the world her truth.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.633
We go to trial
so she can be heard.

25:34.767 --> 25:38.037
The truth,
that's what heals.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.845
If you're going to trial
because--

25:45.878 --> 25:48.047
because you want to win...

25:49.949 --> 25:52.585
You're in the wrong place.

25:56.623 --> 25:59.592
- He's being arraigned.

25:59.626 --> 26:01.861
And if he doesn't make a deal,
then we're gonna go to trial.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.831
- And I'd have to testify.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.365
- Yeah.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.670
What if they ask me
about the first accusation?

26:10.703 --> 26:13.205
I lied, Uncle Sonny.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.774
- Look...

26:14.807 --> 26:17.977
I'm not telling you to perjure
yourself on the stand.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.613
But if nobody asks,
you don't volunteer.

26:20.647 --> 26:21.948
Do you understand?

26:29.656 --> 26:31.023
- No.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.358
No, of course not.

26:36.663 --> 26:37.664
Hey.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.901
The first time I met you,

26:41.934 --> 26:43.035
you were three months old,

26:43.069 --> 26:44.904
and, uh...

26:44.937 --> 26:46.038
you wouldn't smile for me,

26:46.072 --> 26:47.273
no--no matter what I did.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.044
You just stared at me.
You're very serious.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.016
But you were so cute...

26:58.150 --> 27:00.152
That I started smiling.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.688
And then all of a sudden,
like--

27:01.721 --> 27:04.156
like somebody flipped
a light switch,

27:04.190 --> 27:07.226
your face lit up, and--
and you smiled at me.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.998
That was all you needed.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.133
You just wanted me to be happy.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.671
You've always been like that,
Mia.

27:18.705 --> 27:25.111
*

27:25.144 --> 27:26.979
And I promise you,

27:27.013 --> 27:29.281
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen.

27:35.722 --> 27:37.790
*

27:45.965 --> 27:47.133
Hey, what are you doing?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.667
Come on, would you stop that?

27:51.003 --> 27:52.805
- I'm a nervous wreck,
Dominick.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.306
And it's your fault.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.942
We never should have
gone after Ethan,

27:55.975 --> 27:57.209
gotten the police involved.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.079
Now my daughter's
been raped twice.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.214
- Mia's gonna get through this.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.816
All right, Teresa?
We all will.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.451
- Just fix this!

28:05.484 --> 28:07.887
You got to fix this.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.256
I can't do this alone.

28:12.959 --> 28:19.732
*

28:23.002 --> 28:23.302
.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.370
- Maybe it was stupid,
but I thought we should talk.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.875
- I texted him.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.076
I asked him to come over.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.214
- I never thought...

28:35.247 --> 28:36.883
I mean, there were people
there, and--

28:36.916 --> 28:39.485
- What happened
when he got there, Mia?

28:40.853 --> 28:42.889
- He was mad.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.357
He said I was being selfish.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.227
That I was ruining his life.

28:48.260 --> 28:52.164
He said, "If my life is going
down the toilet,

28:52.198 --> 28:54.400
I'm going to take you with me."

28:59.005 --> 29:00.406
And then he...

29:02.842 --> 29:04.343
He pushed me on the bed.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.413
Pulled my sweats down.

29:09.816 --> 29:11.417
And he, um...

29:20.893 --> 29:25.231
- He held a pillow over my face
so I couldn't scream.

29:28.334 --> 29:31.270
And he forced his penis
into my vagina.

29:33.372 --> 29:35.174
- Thank you, Mia.

29:38.077 --> 29:39.345
- Well, that sounds awful, Mia.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.547
But I'm gonna let that be
for now.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.282
What I want to talk
to you about

29:43.315 --> 29:45.151
is the first time
you cried rape.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.119
- Objection.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.888
- Withdrawn.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.123
Do you think a mere
year suspension

29:51.157 --> 29:52.324
is sufficient punishment

29:52.358 --> 29:54.460
for what you claim
Ethan did to you?

29:55.327 --> 29:56.963
- I didn't know.

29:56.996 --> 29:59.431
I mean, the police thought
he should go to prison.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.367
- And that would be your uncle,

30:01.400 --> 30:04.436
Detective Dominick Carisi?

30:04.470 --> 30:05.872
- Yes.

30:05.905 --> 30:09.441
- Uh, and did Uncle Dom
look into your case?

30:09.475 --> 30:10.342
- Yes.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.911
- Like any good uncle would.

30:11.944 --> 30:13.512
And what did he find?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.314
- He said there wasn't
enough evidence

30:15.347 --> 30:17.850
to pursue a criminal case
against Ethan.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.119
- Well, that's surprising,
don't you think?

30:20.152 --> 30:22.321
I mean, two English professors,

30:22.354 --> 30:24.490
an adjunct sociology professor,

30:24.523 --> 30:27.526
and a grad student
in medieval music

30:27.559 --> 30:29.361
thought he was so guilty,

30:29.395 --> 30:30.863
the college had
to toss his ass--

30:30.897 --> 30:31.998
- Objection.

30:32.031 --> 30:33.599
- You've crossed the line,
Ms. Heller.

30:33.632 --> 30:36.402
- A bunch of unqualified
eggheads destroy a kid's life

30:36.435 --> 30:38.337
on evidence that couldn't pass

30:38.370 --> 30:40.006
a motion to dismiss
in a real court.

30:40.039 --> 30:42.274
No, I think that line
was erased a long time ago.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.342
- You are looking at contempt.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.977
One more outburst...

30:45.011 --> 30:47.246
- You wanted Ethan to go
to prison, didn't you, Mia?

30:48.280 --> 30:50.382
- I don't know.
- Of course you did.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.984
His punishment should fit
his crime.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.220
I mean, he violated you,
for Chrissake.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.487
He should get worse
than living at home,

30:55.521 --> 30:57.056
eating Mommy's pancakes.
- Your Honor.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.357
- And you were gonna make sure

30:58.390 --> 31:00.993
that he spent many, many years
behind bars.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.896
That's why you let him into
the room, isn't that right?

31:03.930 --> 31:05.131
- No.
- You slept with him,

31:05.164 --> 31:06.398
and you cried rape.

31:06.432 --> 31:07.633
I mean, after all,
it happened once.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.335
Who wouldn't believe you
a second time?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.303
Certainly not your uncle,
the detective.

31:11.337 --> 31:14.373
- That is it.
I'm fining you $1,500.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.076
- A small price to pay
for ruining a boy's life.

31:17.109 --> 31:18.410
- Make that $2,000.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.279
- No more questions.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.222
- I treated it like I would any
other case of sexual assault.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.423
I took a victim statement.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.125
- Did Mia identify
her attacker?

31:33.159 --> 31:35.627
- She told me that she'd been
raped by Ethan Hartley.

31:36.795 --> 31:40.199
- I escorted her to
the hospital for an examination

31:40.232 --> 31:41.467
to run a rape kit.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.102
- What were the results
of the rape kit?

31:43.135 --> 31:45.404
- The doctor determined
from the vaginal bruising

31:45.437 --> 31:48.107
that there had been
forcible penetration.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.410
The semen samples collected
were a DNA match

31:51.443 --> 31:53.345
for Ethan Hartley.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.047
- Thank you, Detective.
- Mm-hmm.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.353
- You love your niece,
don't you, Detective?

32:01.387 --> 32:03.622
- Very much.
- Well, that's beautiful.

32:03.655 --> 32:06.192
And I'm guessing
that you felt terrible

32:06.225 --> 32:07.426
that you couldn't help Mia

32:07.459 --> 32:09.195
the first time she claimed
she was raped.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.463
- I did, but I never expected--
- No, no, no, no.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.432
Nobody's blaming you,
Detective.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.301
But the truth is,
if you had arrested Ethan

32:15.334 --> 32:17.036
the first time,

32:17.069 --> 32:18.570
he wouldn't have raped her
the second time.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.439
- The school's investigation
was incomplete.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.574
There was nothing
that I could do.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.243
- Well, let me ask you this.

32:24.276 --> 32:27.113
Did Mia have similar vaginal
bruising after the first rape?

32:27.146 --> 32:29.448
- The school did not perform
a medical examination.

32:29.481 --> 32:33.185
- Was she curled up in a ball,
shivering?

32:33.219 --> 32:34.987
- None of the witnesses
at the school hearing

32:35.021 --> 32:35.887
testified as such.

32:35.921 --> 32:38.257
- 'Cause you would think
that the same guy,

32:38.290 --> 32:39.691
same physical assault--

32:39.725 --> 32:41.427
- Objection.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.329
- Withdrawn.

32:43.362 --> 32:47.566
Did Mia describe the two rapes
to you in the same way?

32:58.044 --> 32:59.145
Let me try this.

32:59.178 --> 33:03.082
Can you tell us what Mia
told you about the first rape?

33:06.118 --> 33:13.159
*

33:16.428 --> 33:18.464
Detective, can you?

33:18.497 --> 33:25.671
*

33:26.572 --> 33:28.574
- There was no first rape.

33:38.184 --> 33:41.120
- So Mia lied
to the school tribunal?

33:41.153 --> 33:42.321
- Yes.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.656
- She lied
to your fellow officers.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.691
- Yes.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.194
- She lied to this court.
- Yeah.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.799
- I'm done.
We could all go home now.

33:53.832 --> 34:01.039
*

34:17.423 --> 34:17.589
.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.226
- Carisi, in my office.

34:30.702 --> 34:31.803
What the hell
were you thinking?

34:31.837 --> 34:33.339
- I screwed up.
I'm sorry.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.377
She's my niece.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.112
- Then she should have been
honest with you

34:40.146 --> 34:41.780
from the beginning.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.390
She was raped, Lieutenant.

34:52.658 --> 34:54.193
- Carisi...

34:54.226 --> 34:55.494
You know as well as I do

34:55.527 --> 34:58.397
that the only thing
that matters in these cases

34:58.430 --> 35:00.366
is the credibility
of the parties.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.901
And right now,
on the credibility meter,

35:02.934 --> 35:05.537
your niece is hovering
at about a zero.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.847
- I figured you'd be here.

35:15.881 --> 35:18.184
- Is this where you'd find
Mr. Barba?

35:18.217 --> 35:19.918
- That's his seat, actually.
Can I sit down?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.853
- Help yourself.

35:23.322 --> 35:24.723
- All right.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.392
I'm ready.
Let me have it.

35:26.425 --> 35:29.728
You told the truth.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.763
- Yeah, a little late.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.265
- Only an irrational man
acts rational

35:33.299 --> 35:34.600
when family's involved.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.468
We've all got family secrets,
Detective.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.837
The important thing is,
you spoke up when it counted.

35:40.439 --> 35:43.709
- You know, you're not
such a bad guy for a lawyer.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.177
- I do my best.

35:45.211 --> 35:46.378
I hear you've got
the same disease.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.280
- Well, I think
I've been cured.

35:48.314 --> 35:50.416
- Yeah, sure.

35:50.449 --> 35:51.817
Something's got to wash away
this guilt.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.585
Thought I just absolved you.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.821
- Believe me, I got a lot more
weighing on my soul than that.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.823
Can I get one of those, please?

35:57.856 --> 35:59.258
- You know, my old man,

35:59.291 --> 36:00.926
I guarantee
his last thought was,

36:00.959 --> 36:04.496
"I should have opposed
that damn motion to exclude."

36:04.530 --> 36:06.832
- And you don't want that
to be you?

36:06.865 --> 36:08.600
- I want to do the right thing,
sure.

36:08.634 --> 36:11.703
And winning feels
pretty damn good, but...

36:11.737 --> 36:13.772
there's got to be more,
right?

36:13.805 --> 36:16.975
- Must be.
- Let's hope.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.944
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.750
- Mia started crying.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.685
We both did.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.454
She hugged me
and said she was sorry.

36:28.487 --> 36:30.722
She said that I was strong,
and she wasn't.

36:30.756 --> 36:33.259
She said I could handle it,
but she couldn't.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.596
And then she kissed me
and led me onto the bed.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.598
- A bit of the old
consolation sex?

36:39.631 --> 36:40.932
- Objection.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.501
- Well, what would you call it,
Mr. Stone?

36:42.534 --> 36:45.371
- Mr. Stone is not
on the stand, Counselor.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.905
Continue.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.876
- I slept with her.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.580
- No.

36:54.613 --> 36:57.015
It was her idea.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.550
And now I know why.

36:59.785 --> 37:02.488
- So she could claim
I raped her.

37:02.521 --> 37:04.022
And this time
she'd have evidence,

37:04.055 --> 37:06.292
and her uncle
could lead the charge.

37:08.059 --> 37:11.029
I don't know what I did to you,
Mia.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.964
But I don't deserve this.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.670
- No more questions.

37:18.704 --> 37:19.805
- Tell me, Ethan.

37:19.838 --> 37:21.840
What were you studying
in college?

37:21.873 --> 37:23.809
- I was premed.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.412
- Hmm.
You were going to be a doctor.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.913
- I was.

37:27.946 --> 37:29.915
A neurosurgeon.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.384
But that's gone now.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.653
- You don't think
you'll be acquitted?

37:35.954 --> 37:37.989
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.359
I'm already wearing
the scarlet R.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.593
My friends won't talk to me.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.994
You know,
since Hudson booted me,

37:43.028 --> 37:45.063
I applied
to six other colleges.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.700
I got 700s on my SATs,
and that wasn't good enough.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.669
Once the PC police
get their fangs into you,

37:50.702 --> 37:52.704
your life in polite society
is over.

37:52.738 --> 37:54.673
- And that's--
that's what happened to you?

37:54.706 --> 37:55.874
- Sure is.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.476
All it takes is one girl

37:57.509 --> 37:58.810
to say you looked at her funny,
and that's it.

37:58.844 --> 37:59.811
Your life's over.

37:59.845 --> 38:00.812
- Yeah, but you did more

38:00.846 --> 38:02.080
than look at Mia funny, Ethan.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.453
Look, that first time
in her dorm,

38:07.486 --> 38:09.054
we were in it together.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.822
You heard what her uncle,
the cop, said.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.724
I didn't rape her.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.694
- You were railroaded.
- That's right.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.696
- And the bleeding hearts
didn't want to hear the truth.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.964
They wouldn't know the truth

38:18.997 --> 38:20.599
if it hit them in the face.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.867
They sit there with
their self-righteous grins,

38:21.900 --> 38:23.402
pointing their fingers at you,

38:23.435 --> 38:24.836
whether you did something wrong
or not.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.438
- And it pisses you off.
- You're damn right, it does.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.639
- And when you went
to Mia's dorm room,

38:27.673 --> 38:28.807
you planned on telling her
just how much

38:28.840 --> 38:29.908
it pissed you off.

38:29.941 --> 38:32.578
- Objection.
- Overruled.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.981
- That damn school,
they wrap themselves

38:36.014 --> 38:38.384
in their political correctness
and their honor code,

38:38.417 --> 38:39.818
only they don't know
the first thing about honor.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.753
- You were accused;
therefore, you were guilty.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.422
- That's right.
I was already labeled a rapist.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.623
What the hell?
I might as well be a rapist.

38:44.656 --> 38:45.991
- And who better to rape
than Mia Marino?

38:46.024 --> 38:48.394
- That's right!

38:48.427 --> 38:50.729
The bitch ruined me,
and I got to ruin her.

38:55.166 --> 39:02.541
*

39:21.793 --> 39:23.662
- Have you reached
a unanimous verdict?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.432
- We have.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.066
- On the sole count
of the indictment,

39:28.099 --> 39:30.168
rape in the first degree,

39:30.201 --> 39:33.539
we find the defendant,
Ethan Hartley, guilty.

39:35.641 --> 39:38.644
- Members of the jury,
thank you for your service.

39:41.547 --> 39:44.182
- It's okay.
We'll appeal.

39:44.215 --> 39:51.590
*

40:02.701 --> 40:04.436
- It's open.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.539
- Oh, sorry.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.041
There's a time for work,
and a time for not work.

40:10.075 --> 40:15.213
- I just wanted to thank you
for not beheading Carisi.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.450
- Well, what good would he be
to anyone without a head?

40:19.951 --> 40:23.822
You're just gonna charm
your way into our hearts?

40:23.855 --> 40:25.223
- It could work.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.826
- Well, we are New York City
police detectives.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.829
We can see through charming.
- Shame.

40:33.064 --> 40:36.635
So, I hear your son's
a ball player.

40:38.504 --> 40:40.038
- He wants to be.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.908
- You let him know I can get
all the Mets tickets he wants.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.745
- You are good.

40:52.217 --> 40:53.218
- You didn't have to.

40:53.251 --> 40:54.219
- Hey, forget it.
Come on.

40:54.252 --> 40:55.754
Give me that.

40:55.787 --> 40:56.822
- Thanks.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.792
So what's gonna happen to him?

41:00.826 --> 41:02.994
- I figure the judge
will give him seven years.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.832
This is all my fault.

41:06.865 --> 41:09.535
- Hey, listen. Mia.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.202
Don't you ever think that.

41:11.236 --> 41:12.738
Whatever you did,
you didn't deserve

41:12.771 --> 41:14.973
what he did to you,
do you understand that?

41:17.008 --> 41:18.877
- Mm-hmm.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.713
- Come on.

41:21.747 --> 41:24.883
So what'd your mom say
about you leaving school?

41:24.916 --> 41:25.984
- She's thrilled.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.719
You didn't tell her.

41:27.753 --> 41:30.622
- When I was 14, she made me
go to class with pneumonia.

41:30.656 --> 41:32.190
- Well,
you deserve some time off.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.291
She'll understand.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.061
- Right.
After she kills me.

41:36.094 --> 41:37.128
- I'll help you
break it to her.

41:37.162 --> 41:38.764
- Then she'll hate you too.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.699
- She's my big sister.
She's supposed to hate me.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.069
- Hey, come here, Mia.

41:44.102 --> 41:46.772
You're gonna be good.

41:46.805 --> 41:47.806
You'll be good.
