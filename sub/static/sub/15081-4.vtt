01:06.945 --> 01:08.421
Gotcha!

01:12.856 --> 01:13.589
Got it!

01:19.668 --> 01:20.934
The rabbit prince.

01:38.633 --> 01:39.767
Thank you.

01:39.801 --> 01:41.700
I love the smell of sugarcane
in the morning.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.100
Yeah controlled burn,
my ass.

01:43.134 --> 01:45.901
Hey, make sure that red stuff
doesn't touch my dead stuff.

01:45.935 --> 01:47.336
Yes, ma'am.

01:49.473 --> 01:50.941
Yep. He's dead.

01:57.612 --> 02:00.180
You Declan?
You found the body?

02:00.214 --> 02:01.414
Cryin' shame.

02:01.448 --> 02:03.614
Oh, you know who that is?
Talking about the burn.

02:03.648 --> 02:04.982
Letting a good fire
go to waste.

02:05.016 --> 02:06.785
Yeah, why do they do that,
anyway?

02:06.819 --> 02:08.219
You're not
from around here?

02:08.253 --> 02:09.645
Uh, Chi-town.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.113
Windy City?

02:11.148 --> 02:12.380
Chicago?

02:13.615 --> 02:15.415
Before they can harvest
the sugarcane,

02:15.449 --> 02:16.982
you got to clear up
this here.

02:17.016 --> 02:18.349
Fire brings out
the rabbits.

02:18.384 --> 02:19.816
Rabbits bring out
the muck boys.

02:19.850 --> 02:22.984
You caught all these rabbits?
You must be fast.

02:23.018 --> 02:23.985
Got to be.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.252
Coach Ward say you got to catch 50,
you want to play in the Mud Bowl.

02:28.062 --> 02:30.482
Oh man don't tell me you aint
never heard of no Mud Bowl.

02:30.555 --> 02:32.055
Only the biggest football game
all year!

02:32.089 --> 02:33.255
What, bigger than
the Super Bowl?

02:33.290 --> 02:35.356
Around these parts,
yeah.

02:35.391 --> 02:38.224
Palm Grove King Snakes gonna put
the smack-down on the Panthers.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.658
Let me guess. You're going
for the King Snake

02:39.692 --> 02:41.892
DeAndre Matthews --
that's my boy.

02:41.927 --> 02:43.293
Palm Grove wide receiver.

02:43.328 --> 02:45.727
Say he got a shot in the NFL
someday -- just like me.

02:45.762 --> 02:47.962
Oh, yeah? How many rabbits
you got in there?

02:47.997 --> 02:51.364
Seven. Would have been more,
too, hadn't found that dumb old body.

02:51.398 --> 02:53.065
You want to buy one?

02:53.099 --> 02:54.499
What, a rabbit?

02:54.534 --> 02:55.666
Yeah.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.034
Sure you don't know
who that body is?

02:58.069 --> 03:00.969
No, sir, but I'll give you
this cottontail just for $2.

03:01.003 --> 03:02.003
Make good pets.

03:02.037 --> 03:04.571
If you don't want no pet,
just cook it.

03:04.605 --> 03:06.005
Tastes good, too.

03:06.039 --> 03:08.173
All right.

03:08.207 --> 03:10.374
Well...

03:10.409 --> 03:11.475
Here.

03:11.509 --> 03:14.510
Keep the change.

03:49.238 --> 03:51.505
Some say
I don't play well with others.

03:51.539 --> 03:53.939
I was a damn good Detective
in Chicago

03:53.973 --> 03:55.706
until a disagreement
with my boss

03:55.741 --> 03:58.174
encouraged me to pack it up
and make a change.

03:58.208 --> 03:59.874
So I put the Windy City
in my rearview

03:59.908 --> 04:01.342
and headed
to the Sunshine State

04:01.376 --> 04:04.411
to kick back, play some golf,
work on my tan,

04:04.445 --> 04:06.212
maybe write the occasional
speeding ticket.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.880
Yeah, well...

04:08.915 --> 04:09.982
That didn't work out.

04:09.992 --> 04:13.492

04:21.023 --> 04:23.524
I didn't realize
this was a kosher crime scene.

04:23.558 --> 04:25.792
Otherwise, I would have
brought my tchotchkes.

04:25.826 --> 04:27.093
What?

04:27.127 --> 04:28.127
Daniel!

04:28.161 --> 04:29.628
"Happy Bat Mitzvah,
Esther"?

04:29.662 --> 04:32.864
Don't start. I hauled ass all
the way from North Dade County.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.932
Marisol said
she's having crÃ¨me brulÃ©e.

04:34.966 --> 04:36.266
Esther?

04:36.301 --> 04:37.334
Ben Feldman's daughter.

04:37.368 --> 04:39.168
It's an important
rite of passage.

04:40.203 --> 04:41.602
Feels like
blunt-force trauma.

04:41.636 --> 04:43.970
There's also a distinctive
ligature mark around his neck.

04:44.004 --> 04:45.304
Made by...?

04:45.339 --> 04:48.106
A ligature,
something distinctive.

04:48.140 --> 04:49.374
Daniel.

04:49.408 --> 04:50.408
I'm on it.

04:50.442 --> 04:52.276
His suit's almost
as nice as yours.

04:52.310 --> 04:53.443
He was dragged.

04:53.478 --> 04:55.845
Postmortem abrasions
on his back and torso.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.680
Killed elsewhere,
dumped here?

04:58.714 --> 05:01.115
One of the muckety mucks
from Okeechobee Sugar

05:01.150 --> 05:02.550
is on their way.

05:02.584 --> 05:05.518
Oh, so that's why FDLE
is investigating and not Pahokee P.D.

05:05.552 --> 05:07.586
They don't call it "big sugar"
for nothing.

05:07.620 --> 05:10.821
Slightly tanned and an indentation around
the right middle finger.

05:10.855 --> 05:11.955
He's missing a ring.

05:11.989 --> 05:13.989
Yeah, but he's got
everything else. Daniel!

05:14.024 --> 05:16.525
Cellphone, car-rental keys,
motel-room keys, wallet.

05:16.559 --> 05:19.627
His name's Curtis Taylor,
age 38, from Dallas, Texas.

05:19.661 --> 05:21.428
Business card says he's
a real-estate developer.

05:21.463 --> 05:23.097
So, someone buries
Curtis here,

05:23.131 --> 05:24.898
hoping no one else
will find him.

05:24.932 --> 05:26.499
No, but the killer
underestimated the muck.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.601
What is it about this muck?
Muck boys, muck city, muck muck.

05:28.635 --> 05:30.002
No, it's the soil.

05:30.036 --> 05:32.004
It's so rich and fertile,
anything will grow in it.

05:32.038 --> 05:34.139
But nothing stays buried in it
for long.

05:34.173 --> 05:35.907
So we're looking for someone
who wouldn't know that.

05:35.941 --> 05:37.374
Mm-hmm.
So, an outsider?

05:37.409 --> 05:39.309
Yeah, and there's been plenty
of them around lately.

05:39.343 --> 05:41.979
The family that owns O.K. Sugar
is looking for a buyer.

05:42.013 --> 05:43.413
They've owned this land
for generations,

05:43.448 --> 05:44.881
and now it seems
that they want to sell.

05:44.916 --> 05:47.116
Heard it's worth
about $1.3 billion.

05:47.150 --> 05:47.916
Ooh.

05:47.951 --> 05:49.651
Competition must be stiff.

05:53.288 --> 05:54.654
I can't take him anywhere.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.389
Uh, wait.
Wait a second.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.657
They're here.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.892
You want to meet
big sugar?

06:04.826 --> 06:07.729
Shannon Simpson,
V.P. of P.R. for O.K. Sugar.

06:07.763 --> 06:09.231
This is a terrible tragedy,

06:09.265 --> 06:11.700
and the company's prayers
are with the victim's family.

06:11.734 --> 06:13.035
You know
who Curtis Taylor is?

06:13.069 --> 06:15.170
No. I checked.
He's not a potential buyer.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.505
But since the body
was dumped on company land,

06:17.540 --> 06:20.308
we'd like to do whatever we can
to help you with your investigation.

06:20.342 --> 06:22.643
All we ask for
is your discretion.

06:22.678 --> 06:25.445
"Diligence," "thoroughness,"
I get.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.312
Not sure what you mean
by "discretion."

06:27.346 --> 06:30.647
Every outlet from ESPN
to Joe Sports Blogger

06:30.682 --> 06:32.149
is in town for the game.

06:32.183 --> 06:34.651
Half of them would run over
their own grandmothers

06:34.685 --> 06:37.053
to get a story about a dead body
in the cane field.

06:37.087 --> 06:38.387
And you're worried
it might affect the sale.

06:38.422 --> 06:40.823
My job is to protect
the company's interests.

06:40.857 --> 06:42.090
So is mine.

06:42.125 --> 06:43.925
Unless your company is
interested in hiding a murder.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.126
No, we're not
hiding anything.

06:45.161 --> 06:46.594
In fact,
we're giving you everything.

06:46.628 --> 06:48.129
This is a list of employees

06:48.163 --> 06:51.031
with reprimands and complaints
on their file.

06:51.066 --> 06:52.666
Big sugar, Big Brother.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.702
Locker theft,
vending-machine abuse -- wow.

06:55.736 --> 06:58.504
I realize it's all
pretty small-time stuff.

06:58.538 --> 06:59.505
Except for Ron Anderson.

06:59.539 --> 07:00.839
Ron, yeah.

07:00.874 --> 07:03.708
Uh, vandalized the cars
of three executives,

07:03.743 --> 07:06.244
threatened to take a baseball
bat to the C.E.O.'s head

07:06.278 --> 07:07.578
if he sold the company,

07:07.613 --> 07:09.046
and about two weeks ago,

07:09.080 --> 07:11.114
he got into a screaming match
with a junior exec.

07:11.149 --> 07:12.916
Turned into a bar brawl.

07:12.950 --> 07:14.617
And you didn't fire him?

07:14.652 --> 07:16.953
He's pretending
to be an activist.

07:16.987 --> 07:18.754
We...Don't want to
make him a martyr.

07:18.789 --> 07:20.289
Where does
this boy scout work?

07:20.323 --> 07:23.458
In the Fields.
He's an ignition specialist.

07:23.492 --> 07:25.159
Is that political-correctness
corporate-ESE

07:25.193 --> 07:26.226
for "he starts fires"?

07:26.261 --> 07:28.028
He was supposed to
start a fire

07:28.062 --> 07:30.296
in the field
where the body was found.

07:30.330 --> 07:31.530
Wind shifted.

07:31.564 --> 07:33.198
Division of Forestry
pulled the permit.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.799
Lucky for Ron.

07:34.834 --> 07:36.967
Otherwise, his fire would've
destroyed our evidence.

07:37.002 --> 07:38.235
You want to talk to him?

07:52.214 --> 07:54.314
Yeah, I dumped some trash
on an executive's Mercedes.

07:54.349 --> 07:57.352
So what? Everybody in Pahokee
hates big sugar.

07:57.386 --> 07:59.120
Can't live with them,
can't live without them, huh?

07:59.154 --> 08:00.088
Like a bad marriage.

08:00.122 --> 08:02.022
Name "Curtis Taylor" ring a bell?
No.

08:02.057 --> 08:03.590
What about this guy?

08:03.625 --> 08:04.658
Unh-unh.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.259
"Unh-unh"?
Take another look.

08:06.293 --> 08:07.293
I don't know him.

08:07.328 --> 08:08.761
I didn't <i>say</i>
<i>you knew him.</i>

08:08.795 --> 08:10.796
But you have <i>seen</i> him before,
haven't you, Ron?

08:10.830 --> 08:13.131
Last week, he was
hanging around the field,

08:13.165 --> 08:14.565
the football field.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.168
High School?
Yeah, he was watching us
practice every night.

08:17.202 --> 08:19.036
"Us"?
Yeah, "us."

08:19.070 --> 08:21.438
I'm the King Snakes' assistant
to the coaching assistant.

08:21.472 --> 08:22.572
Impressive.

08:22.607 --> 08:23.907
Damn straight.

08:23.941 --> 08:25.675
We won the Mud Bowl
the last two years,

08:25.709 --> 08:27.676
and come Friday,
it's gonna be three, baby.

08:27.711 --> 08:30.412
Never heard of the assistant
to the coach's assistant.

08:30.446 --> 08:31.813
It's a volunteer position.

08:31.847 --> 08:35.115
Look, I could stand here and
talk football with you all day,

08:35.150 --> 08:38.485
but I got to set this fire
'fore these winds shift again.

08:47.328 --> 08:50.696
Damn it, Ray.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.931
Uh...

08:51.965 --> 08:56.468
Overdue orange, repo red,
poorhouse purple.

08:56.502 --> 08:58.035
Oh, my God, girl,
don't you wish

08:58.070 --> 09:00.271
there were a pot of gold
at the end of this rainbow?

09:00.305 --> 09:03.240
Are you <i>trying</i>
<i>to cheer me up?</i>

09:03.274 --> 09:05.108
Oh, Callie, you're not
the first person

09:05.143 --> 09:06.843
to get a little behind
on your bills.

09:06.877 --> 09:08.912
I'm more
than a <i>little</i> behind.

09:08.946 --> 09:11.347
Well, have you talked to Ray
about this?

09:11.382 --> 09:12.815
Because --

09:12.850 --> 09:14.717
I don't know.
Maybe he could do something.

09:14.751 --> 09:15.817
How?
I don't know, but --

09:15.852 --> 09:17.552
hey, honey.

09:17.586 --> 09:19.387
Did you eat yet?

09:19.422 --> 09:21.689
I'm not hungry.

09:23.258 --> 09:25.792
In about four days,

09:25.827 --> 09:28.194
someone's having a birthday,
I think.

09:28.229 --> 09:31.130
Pretty big one, too.
Yeah, whatever.

09:31.164 --> 09:34.866
Uh, Ray promised to take him
shooting when he turned 13.

09:34.901 --> 09:39.170
Well, hell.
I can do that.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.771
Used to take your daddy
all the time.

09:40.805 --> 09:42.439
Yeah. Sure.

09:42.473 --> 09:43.940
Thanks...Grandma.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.241
Hey.

09:45.275 --> 09:48.277
Listen, buddy, I'm a good shot.
It's gonna be fun.

09:48.311 --> 09:49.444
Yeah.

09:49.478 --> 09:51.613
It...Will be.

09:51.647 --> 09:55.583
Thank you, Jody,
but I can take him shooting.

09:55.617 --> 09:59.886
No way.

10:07.930 --> 10:09.797
There's as many different types
of rope

10:09.831 --> 10:11.399
as there are material.

10:11.433 --> 10:14.234
Rope is one of man's
earliest inventions.

10:14.268 --> 10:16.236
Well, let's hope you
don't have to go back <i>that</i> far

10:16.270 --> 10:17.970
to find a match.

10:18.005 --> 10:19.338
Daughters are a mitzvah,

10:19.372 --> 10:21.473
and I should know --
I have three of my own.

10:21.507 --> 10:24.577
Did Esther like her gifts?

10:24.611 --> 10:26.780
Great.
Great, great.

10:26.814 --> 10:29.048
Mazel tov, Ben.
Bye-bye.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.416
Since when
do you speak Hebrew?

10:30.451 --> 10:31.951
It's called having respect
for other people's traditions.

10:31.985 --> 10:33.285
You should try it.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.554
You ever heard of an assistant
to the coaching assistant?

10:35.589 --> 10:36.722
Come again?

10:36.756 --> 10:38.023
Sounds like an intern.

10:38.058 --> 10:40.292
Turns out Curtis was hanging out
around football practice.

10:40.327 --> 10:42.528
Curtis might have been a
football player back in the day,

10:42.562 --> 10:44.329
but he's had two
arthroscopic meniscectomies

10:44.364 --> 10:46.097
and an A.C.L. reconstruction,

10:46.132 --> 10:47.699
both common injuries
for a defensive lineman.

10:47.733 --> 10:49.701
Hard to believe a guy like that
wouldn't go down without a fight.

10:49.735 --> 10:51.436
He's got defensive wounds
but not many.

10:51.470 --> 10:53.937
And I found sodium hydroxide
on his hands

10:53.972 --> 10:55.739
and in his abrasions
on his torso.

10:56.874 --> 10:57.874
It's lye.

10:57.909 --> 10:59.443
Why would the killer
put lye on the body?

10:59.477 --> 11:00.977
Lye is an accelerant.

11:01.012 --> 11:03.180
Have you identified what made
those ligature marks yet?

11:03.214 --> 11:05.849
An accelerant like lye would have
helped the fire destroy the body.

11:05.883 --> 11:07.017
That's not how he died.

11:07.051 --> 11:08.618
Thought you said
there was blunt-force trauma?

11:08.653 --> 11:10.053
There was, but that's
not what killed him.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.720
You'll never guess.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.322
He drowned.

11:13.356 --> 11:15.920
Or maybe you <i>will.</i>
<i>How did you --</i>

11:15.954 --> 11:17.185
the question is now,

11:17.219 --> 11:19.387
what kind of water did he
drown <i>in</i> -- fresh or salty?

11:19.421 --> 11:21.022
Try soapy.

11:21.056 --> 11:24.825
Now, <i>that</i> I would
never have guessed.

11:28.284 --> 11:30.084
Hut!

11:35.024 --> 11:36.257
You know who that is?

11:36.292 --> 11:38.893
Everybody knows
who that is.

11:38.928 --> 11:40.161
That's Bobby Bowden.

11:40.196 --> 11:41.496
I'm gonna introduce myself.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.330
You think Bobby Bowden
wants to meet <i>you?</i>

11:43.365 --> 11:45.165
I doubt it,
but <i>I</i> want to meet <i>him.</i>

11:45.199 --> 11:47.100
But...

11:47.135 --> 11:49.669
And, by gosh, we've had a lot of
great players at Florida state

11:49.704 --> 11:52.905
from Belle Mar and also from Palm Grove.
Right.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.508
There's as much speed out here
as anywhere in the country.

11:55.542 --> 11:56.909
Excuse me. Hi.
Hey. How you doing?

11:56.943 --> 11:58.610
I'm Jim Longworth.
Jim, how you doing, boy?

11:58.644 --> 12:00.912
Look, I'm not from around here,
but I'm a huge fan.

12:00.946 --> 12:02.580
Well, that's good.
It's good to see you.

12:02.614 --> 12:04.081
If you'll excuse me,
I've got to go.

12:04.115 --> 12:06.016
Yeah, anyway, I was just
wondering, could you, uh...

12:06.050 --> 12:08.585
Maybe just, you know...
Say it for me once?

12:08.619 --> 12:09.652
Say what?

12:09.687 --> 12:11.220
You know.

12:11.254 --> 12:12.421
"Dadgumit."

12:12.455 --> 12:15.557
No. Dadgumit.

12:23.432 --> 12:25.967
You finished processing
Curtis' motel room?

12:26.002 --> 12:27.302
Define "finished."

12:27.336 --> 12:29.503
There's too many fingerprints
to count

12:29.538 --> 12:32.372
and enough bodily fluids to
shut down the CDC, but no blood.

12:32.407 --> 12:33.607
And no missing ring.

12:33.641 --> 12:35.942
I'll send someone to
the cane fields to look for it.

12:35.977 --> 12:38.211
And, by "someone,"
I do mean Daniel.

12:38.246 --> 12:40.180
What about the bathtub?

12:40.214 --> 12:42.115
Too small
for a 260-pound man.

12:42.150 --> 12:44.451
Someone could have
held his head underwater,

12:44.485 --> 12:45.952
but housekeeping said
the stopper in the bath

12:45.987 --> 12:47.554
had been broken
for months.

12:47.588 --> 12:49.688
Daniel, I'm gonna need you
to pull the records

12:49.723 --> 12:53.925
on Curtis'...Motel phone,
home phone, cellphone.

12:53.959 --> 12:57.194
Saxophone, Dictaphone,
xylophone.

12:57.228 --> 12:58.762
What?

12:58.796 --> 13:00.764
I'm sorry, Dr. Sanchez.
Were you talking to me?

13:00.798 --> 13:03.132
You're not gonna find the killer
looking over there, Daniel.

13:03.166 --> 13:04.300
Hmm?

13:04.334 --> 13:05.901
These players are amazing.

13:05.935 --> 13:08.169
Muck City has sent
48 players to the NFL --

13:08.204 --> 13:10.305
more than anywhere else
in the country.

13:10.339 --> 13:13.274
Anquan Boldin, Santonio Holmes,
Edgerrin James.

13:13.308 --> 13:16.243
DeAndre Matthews.

13:17.378 --> 13:18.612
Find that film crew.

13:18.646 --> 13:20.446
See if there's any "B" roll
on the victim from last week.

13:20.481 --> 13:21.514
Listen to me.

13:21.548 --> 13:23.315
I <i>am</i> listening.

13:23.350 --> 13:26.052
Why didn't you tell me?
I didn't know.

13:26.086 --> 13:29.622
Trust me.
Don't worry. Okay?

13:34.494 --> 13:35.661
Hey, coach.

13:35.695 --> 13:37.729
Looked like you were getting
an earful back there.

13:37.764 --> 13:38.863
What was that about?

13:38.898 --> 13:40.565
Ever since that damn
"Blind Side,"

13:40.599 --> 13:43.100
all the players' mothers
think they're Leigh Anne Tuohy.

13:43.134 --> 13:44.568
Gonna tell me
how to play the game.

13:44.602 --> 13:46.436
Yeah?
Whose mother was that?

13:46.470 --> 13:48.804
DeAndre Matthews' mom,
Rita.

13:48.838 --> 13:50.539
Well, I'm not gonna tell you
how to do anything.

13:50.573 --> 13:51.973
I just want to
ask you something.

13:52.008 --> 13:53.642
Okay.

13:53.676 --> 13:55.009
What channel you with?

13:55.044 --> 13:57.845
Oh, FDLE.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.548
You know this guy?

14:00.582 --> 14:02.917
Yeah.
Saw him on the news.

14:02.951 --> 14:05.452
It's the guy they found
in the sugarcane field.

14:05.486 --> 14:07.753
Last week, was he hanging
around practice?

14:07.787 --> 14:10.221
Man, when I'm coaching,
my head's in the game.

14:10.255 --> 14:12.355
I don't have time
to be messing around,

14:12.390 --> 14:14.323
looking at who's
in the stands.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.326
<i>This isn't just a game.</i>
<i>It's a religion.</i>

14:18.360 --> 14:20.562
There's Curtis,
in the background.

14:20.596 --> 14:22.097
Sitting with
DeAndre Matthews.

14:22.132 --> 14:25.634
What's a murdered real-estate
developer from Texas

14:25.668 --> 14:28.003
want with a Palm Grove
football phenom?

14:28.038 --> 14:29.371
Play that bit again.

14:31.574 --> 14:34.576
Maybe Curtis is a booster,
recruiting for a college team.

14:37.013 --> 14:38.680
What do you think?
Shh!

14:38.715 --> 14:40.148
What, "shh"?
You can't hear them.

14:40.182 --> 14:41.315
I'm listening
to their body language.

14:41.350 --> 14:44.386
They're both extremely...
Tense.

14:44.421 --> 14:46.054
They both have
something to hide.

14:46.089 --> 14:48.290
I want a copy
of this footage.

15:09.356 --> 15:11.423
Hey, Chicago.
Hey.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.124
How's the cottontail?
Delicious.

15:13.158 --> 15:14.524
Figure out who killed
that man yet?

15:14.558 --> 15:16.625
I'm working on it.
Got any tips?

15:16.659 --> 15:19.056
Yeah. Try this.

15:19.090 --> 15:21.057
It's for good luck.

15:21.092 --> 15:24.993
Thanks.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.800
Afternoon, ladies.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.568
Oh, afternoon!
Afternoon. Afternoon.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.969
Can you tell me where
Rita Matthews is?

15:38.003 --> 15:40.204
You found her.
That's where she stays.

15:40.238 --> 15:41.672
What do you want
with her?

15:41.706 --> 15:43.039
I wanted to ask her
some questions

15:43.074 --> 15:44.574
about her son, DeAndre,
mainly.

15:44.609 --> 15:46.909
That young man is quick-fast.

15:46.944 --> 15:49.211
Got the best hands
of anyone here in Pahokee.

15:49.245 --> 15:51.346
Was voted Mr. Football
three years in a row

15:51.381 --> 15:52.814
ever since he been here.

15:52.848 --> 15:54.449
How many rabbits
does that translate into?

15:54.483 --> 15:56.050
Rabbits.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.653
Them recruiters always want to know
about them rabbits, don't they?

15:58.687 --> 16:00.721
How many recruiters
DeAndre been talking to?

16:00.789 --> 16:03.990
Oh, Florida State,
Oklahoma, Austin.

16:04.025 --> 16:05.225
Austin, huh?

16:05.259 --> 16:07.727
Vivian, don't be telling
all of DeAndre's business.

16:07.761 --> 16:08.961
You from Big Ten country?

16:08.996 --> 16:10.930
I like Michigan for DeAndre.

16:10.964 --> 16:12.698
He'd be better off
at Ohio state.

16:12.732 --> 16:15.033
Oh, no.
No, no, no, Vivian.

16:15.067 --> 16:16.401
DeAndre needs to
go off somewhere

16:16.435 --> 16:17.869
where the offense
is fast-passing

16:17.903 --> 16:19.203
and heavy-passing
and high-scoring.

16:19.237 --> 16:21.505
Yeah.
Only way he gonna get
them stats for the NFL.

16:21.539 --> 16:23.607
Everything that you
want to know about DeAndre,

16:23.641 --> 16:25.708
you'll find out on Friday at the big game.
Mm-hmm.

16:25.743 --> 16:28.210
Oh, yeah, 'cause coach Ward
is gonna take them King Snakes

16:28.245 --> 16:29.578
straight to the promised land.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.980
Sometimes you need to take
matters into your own hands.

16:32.014 --> 16:33.314
That's why I've been
praying on it.

16:33.349 --> 16:36.917
She been making everybody
in the salon pray on it, too.

16:36.952 --> 16:40.287
Uh, dear lord,
don't make those nasty...

16:40.321 --> 16:41.321
Mm-hmm.
...No-good...

16:41.355 --> 16:42.322
Mm-hmm.

16:42.356 --> 16:43.689
...Do-nothing Panthers win.

16:43.724 --> 16:44.890
Amen.

16:44.924 --> 16:46.825
Amen!

16:46.859 --> 16:49.060
Amen.
What salon is that?

16:49.095 --> 16:51.195
Mine --
Minnie's House of Beauty,

16:51.230 --> 16:52.730
right there on Lake Avenue.

16:52.764 --> 16:55.232
What can you tell me
about Rita and Coach Ward?

16:57.436 --> 16:58.636
Who told you about them?

16:58.670 --> 17:00.871
Vivian.
Nothing to tell.

17:00.905 --> 17:03.607
What school you say you from?
He didn't.

17:03.641 --> 17:05.775
Oh, I'm investigating
a murder.

17:05.810 --> 17:08.044
You know, the guy
in the sugarcane Fields?

17:08.078 --> 17:09.744
Hand me that bowl.

17:26.392 --> 17:29.527
That was awesome!
I want to try.

17:29.562 --> 17:31.663
All right, now,
remember what I told you?

17:31.697 --> 17:33.398
Yeah,
goggles and glasses.

17:33.432 --> 17:35.266
Okay, barrel always down
and away.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.001
This is the safety.
Safety always remains on.

17:37.035 --> 17:38.569
Finger remains
outside the trigger guard

17:38.603 --> 17:40.103
till you're ready to shoot,
all right?

17:40.137 --> 17:42.972
All right.
Have a feel.

17:43.006 --> 17:44.907
Whoa.

17:44.942 --> 17:47.677
It's heavy.

17:47.711 --> 17:50.847
Have you ever
shot anyone before?

17:50.881 --> 17:52.381
I try not to.

17:52.416 --> 17:54.717
I've <i>been</i> shot.
Where?

17:54.751 --> 17:56.718
Chicago.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.852
Oh, you mean <i>where</i> where.

17:58.887 --> 18:00.186
Yeah.
Oh.

18:00.221 --> 18:02.388
On my ass.
Your mom's seen it.

18:03.590 --> 18:05.825
At the hospital,
when she was treating me.

18:05.859 --> 18:07.726
Yeah.

18:07.761 --> 18:09.762
So...

18:09.796 --> 18:12.964
The guy who shot you --
was he a bad guy?

18:12.999 --> 18:14.766
Not so much a bad guy.

18:14.801 --> 18:17.535
He's a guy having
a really bad day.

18:19.638 --> 18:21.705
All right, ears on.

18:24.275 --> 18:28.176
All right, knees bent,
shoulders back, eyes open.

18:28.210 --> 18:30.878
Now slowly squeeze the trigger.

18:32.514 --> 18:35.316
Whoa.

18:38.453 --> 18:39.887
So to speak.

18:44.592 --> 18:45.958
I hit it!

18:45.992 --> 18:48.360
Yeah. You did.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.429
Beginner's luck. Ears back on.
Let's go again.

18:54.798 --> 18:58.165
Tell me something, Dr. Sanchez.
Do you think I'm stupid?

18:58.199 --> 19:00.066
What makes you think
the FDLE

19:00.101 --> 19:02.834
should pay for your wife's
transportation home

19:02.869 --> 19:05.170
from an Esther Feldman's
Bat Mitzvah?

19:05.204 --> 19:07.572
I was called to a crime scene,
and I couldn't drive her home.

19:07.606 --> 19:08.739
I hired a car.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.707
You hired a <i>limo.</i>
<i>Town Car wouldn't do?</i>

19:10.742 --> 19:12.709
You don't know my wife.

19:12.744 --> 19:14.446
Really?
Yeah.

19:17.253 --> 19:18.987
Fox Sports sent that footage over.

19:19.022 --> 19:20.889
Was Curtis missing
a wedding ring?

19:20.923 --> 19:22.924
No. A half-inch band,
size 12.

19:22.959 --> 19:24.861
Sent Daniel into the Fields
to look for it. Why?

19:24.895 --> 19:25.895
Curtis was married.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.630
Called a ranger buddy of mine
in Texas

19:27.664 --> 19:29.765
to facilitate a death
notification for his wife.

19:29.799 --> 19:31.066
He can't locate her.

19:31.101 --> 19:33.535
But he promised to send us
copies of anything he digs up

19:33.569 --> 19:35.236
on Curtis
and his missing wife.

19:35.271 --> 19:36.371
Well, hope he gets
more than I can.

19:36.405 --> 19:38.105
I'm shut out.
Oh, I'm not surprised.

19:38.140 --> 19:40.707
Muck city doesn't take kindly
to strangers.

19:40.742 --> 19:42.843
Oh, maybe I'll do a little
muckraking on Coach Ward.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.577
Careful --
daring's what I'm thinking of.

19:44.612 --> 19:46.479
A bold move is the only way to move
forward in this investigation.

19:46.513 --> 19:47.780
The game is a big deal.

19:47.814 --> 19:50.015
So is murder.
So is making it out.

19:50.050 --> 19:51.517
The people of Pahokee

19:51.551 --> 19:54.386
have managed to make
a way out of no way,

19:54.420 --> 19:55.920
and they're proud of it,
and they should be.

19:55.954 --> 19:58.456
And we aren't going to do
anything to ruin it for them.

19:58.490 --> 20:01.492
I'm not saying,
"don't investigate."

20:01.526 --> 20:05.128
I'm just saying,
"don't cause a disruption."

20:10.000 --> 20:12.335
Off the break.
Off the break,

20:12.369 --> 20:13.502
get down there!

20:13.537 --> 20:17.306
Sorry.
Just doing my job.

20:20.343 --> 20:22.177
Sorry, kid.

20:22.212 --> 20:23.312
What?

20:23.346 --> 20:25.147
Come on, now.
Come on.

20:25.181 --> 20:26.981
Hold up. What's going on?
Hold up!

20:27.016 --> 20:28.683
Hey, what's going on?!

20:31.086 --> 20:33.753
Get these off of me.
I didn't do nothing!

20:49.848 --> 20:51.848
Thank you.

20:53.050 --> 20:55.184
Sorry about the drama.
Wanted to talk to you.

20:55.218 --> 20:56.952
Couldn't do it
on the 50-yard line.

20:56.986 --> 20:59.121
When'd you last see
your father, DeAndre?

20:59.155 --> 21:02.223
It's just me and my moms.
I don't have a father.

21:02.257 --> 21:04.626
Everybody's got a father.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.762
Seems like
every time I look in the mirror,

21:07.796 --> 21:10.363
I notice one more thing
that reminds me of <i>my</i> dad.

21:10.397 --> 21:14.167
Way he stands, way he frowns
even when he's smiling.

21:14.201 --> 21:16.335
It's really starting
to piss me off.

21:20.207 --> 21:23.576
Apple doesn't fall far.

21:23.611 --> 21:26.145
That man is not my father.

21:27.848 --> 21:31.083
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:31.117 --> 21:35.853
Three years ago,
a woman named Rita Taylor,

21:35.888 --> 21:38.755
she filed this --
protection from abuse --

21:38.790 --> 21:41.391
against her husband,
Curtis.

21:41.425 --> 21:45.362
Two weeks later, she, uh, showed up
in Pahokee with her son.

21:45.397 --> 21:49.566
Only this time, they were using
her maiden name -- Matthews.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.867
How'd he find you?

21:50.901 --> 21:54.069
Saw me in a Youtube video,
playing in our last game.

21:54.103 --> 21:55.770
You weren't happy
that he tracked you down.

21:55.804 --> 21:59.273
I don't care what he does.

21:59.307 --> 22:01.141
I need to get back
to practice.

22:01.175 --> 22:02.709
So the ring was
a peace offering.

22:02.744 --> 22:04.577
He wanted to take you
and your mother back to Texas.

22:04.612 --> 22:06.045
No, over my dead body!

22:06.080 --> 22:08.980
Supposed to be
Mr. upstanding businessman,

22:09.015 --> 22:11.049
Mr. great Austin University
defensive end,

22:11.083 --> 22:13.217
supposed to be
someone I look up to!

22:13.251 --> 22:15.919
Meanwhile, he's beating the hell out
of her, and I didn't do nothing!

22:15.953 --> 22:18.922
You wanted to kill him.
Hell, yeah, I wanted to kill him!

22:20.757 --> 22:23.225
But I <i>didn't.</i>

22:23.259 --> 22:25.394
Look, I didn't do it.

22:25.428 --> 22:28.062
How'd you get those bruises
on your neck?

22:28.097 --> 22:30.631
What, you went after Curtis,
he fought back?

22:30.665 --> 22:32.032
I got these in practice.

22:35.636 --> 22:37.604
You're off the hook,
DeAndre.

22:37.638 --> 22:40.472
Someone confessed
to the murder.

22:40.507 --> 22:41.707
Your mom.

22:49.647 --> 22:52.282
"Curtis started beating me
the year DeAndre was born.

22:52.316 --> 22:54.183
"When I found out
he was in Pahokee,

22:54.218 --> 22:56.886
I couldn't stop thinking about
the hell he put us through

22:56.920 --> 22:58.823
well, this tells me <i>why.</i>

22:58.857 --> 23:00.694
I want to know <i>how.</i>
<i>You already know how.</i>

23:00.728 --> 23:02.162
The confession has to be
in your own words.

23:02.197 --> 23:05.365
I smashed him in the head
with a tire iron from my car.

23:05.399 --> 23:07.232
Seeing him made me so angry.

23:07.267 --> 23:08.733
I couldn't control myself.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.368
So it was <i>his</i> fault?

23:10.402 --> 23:12.703
He just made you so mad,
you <i>had</i> to kill him.

23:14.405 --> 23:16.639
How'd you get the body
out into the field?

23:16.674 --> 23:17.674
In my car.

23:17.708 --> 23:19.942
You moved a 260-pound man

23:19.977 --> 23:22.478
from his motel room
into the trunk of his car.

23:22.512 --> 23:24.313
Yeah. No, I --

23:24.347 --> 23:25.547
what'd you do with the ring?

23:25.581 --> 23:27.783
Curtis wore a ring
on his right hand.

23:27.817 --> 23:30.485
A championship ring
from Austin University.

23:30.520 --> 23:32.721
He was so proud of that.

23:32.756 --> 23:34.625
I threw it in Lake Okeechobee.

23:34.659 --> 23:36.328
Are you seeing coach Ward?

23:36.362 --> 23:39.197
I only ask 'cause you two looked
pretty familiar on the field the other day.

23:39.232 --> 23:42.668
He's my son's coach.
He's a good and decent man.

23:42.702 --> 23:44.536
Good and decent enough
to help you with a dead body?

23:44.570 --> 23:47.139
No,
I did it all by myself!

23:49.875 --> 23:52.478
Okay, Ms. Matthews, I think
I have everything I need.

23:52.513 --> 23:55.048
You're free to go.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.917
That's it?
That's it.

23:56.952 --> 23:58.419
Unless you want to confess
to something else.

23:58.453 --> 24:01.322
Mom, what are you doing?
You need to call a lawyer.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.958
Sure. She can call a lawyer
if she likes.

24:02.992 --> 24:05.393
She's not under arrest.
She didn't kill Curtis.

24:05.428 --> 24:08.329
Your mom is a terrible liar --
worst I've ever seen.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.729
But her instinct to protect
her child is impressive...

24:10.763 --> 24:12.295
And troublesome.

24:12.329 --> 24:13.594
Makes me think you <i>do</i>

24:13.628 --> 24:15.995
actually have something to do
with this murder after all.

24:17.763 --> 24:20.898
And this time,
I really do have to arrest you.

24:20.932 --> 24:24.335
No! Wait! Please!

24:24.369 --> 24:25.905
Please!

24:40.620 --> 24:42.888
Afternoon, ladies.

24:42.922 --> 24:44.456
Nice security system.

24:44.490 --> 24:47.858
That's the <i>alarm</i> system.
<i>That's</i> for security.

24:47.893 --> 24:49.193
We got nothing
to say to you.

24:49.227 --> 24:51.494
Should take my friend over there
and go upside your head.

24:51.528 --> 24:54.363
Careful, or he'll have you
arrested like he did DeAndre.

24:54.398 --> 24:55.865
Mm-hmm.

24:55.899 --> 24:58.434
Okay, then.

25:02.138 --> 25:05.506
I'll take a trim.

25:05.540 --> 25:09.509
You want DeAndre back
in the game, out of custody,

25:09.543 --> 25:12.044
you're gonna have to help me
understand a few things.

25:12.079 --> 25:15.314
You want me
to cut your hair...

25:15.349 --> 25:18.851
And do your job, too?

25:18.885 --> 25:21.220
Well,
I'm <i>doing</i> my job.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.656
In fact, where were
you three ladies

25:23.690 --> 25:26.192
the night
Curtis Taylor was killed?

25:27.528 --> 25:29.562
Here.

25:29.596 --> 25:32.431
I did Vivian's hair, and then we all
went to football practice.

25:32.465 --> 25:34.199
And your husbands?

25:34.234 --> 25:36.135
Please.

25:36.169 --> 25:37.670
What husbands?

25:37.704 --> 25:40.372
Oh, I read you.
Yeah, marriage is hard.

25:40.407 --> 25:42.207
Well,
so I've been told.

25:42.242 --> 25:44.709
'Course, you never know when you're
gonna meet the right person.

25:44.744 --> 25:48.346
Just when you do...
Timing kind of sucks.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.047
You find one,
you put a ring on it.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.416
She already has one.
She's married.

25:52.450 --> 25:54.818
Does her husband know
how you feel?

25:54.853 --> 25:56.987
I doubt it.
He's in prison.

25:57.021 --> 25:59.256
So what you waiting for?

25:59.290 --> 26:01.958
Man gets himself locked up,
she doesn't owe him.

26:01.993 --> 26:04.594
Could be she's scared
to live her own life.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.297
Probably doesn't know exactly
what she wants to do.

26:07.331 --> 26:09.399
You know,
sometimes it's better

26:09.433 --> 26:12.102
when <i>somebody</i> better starts
stepping up and stepping in.

26:12.136 --> 26:14.871
You need to start
stepping up.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.473
Is that what happened
with Rita and Coach Ward?

26:16.508 --> 26:17.875
He stepped up?

26:19.644 --> 26:23.381
Rita confessed
to the murder.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.084
He's messing with us.
No, I took her confession myself.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.186
I mean, I'm pretty sure
she wasn't alone in it,

26:28.221 --> 26:30.756
but, you know, if she wants to
go down for it, I'll let her.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.692
Unless someone tells me if someone
else might have been involved,

26:33.726 --> 26:35.894
or -- oh, really?
Yeah.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.096
We're...Done?

26:37.130 --> 26:38.631
O-okay.

26:38.666 --> 26:40.300
Uh...

26:40.334 --> 26:43.137
Looks kind of uneven,
don't you think?

26:43.171 --> 26:44.605
At the --

26:44.639 --> 26:46.540
right.

26:48.778 --> 26:51.546
There you go.
Have a nice day.

26:57.186 --> 26:58.819
Well, if it isn't
the rabbit prince.

26:58.854 --> 27:01.053
Declan, I got to ask, man,
what's with the bike?

27:01.121 --> 27:02.487
You arrested DeAndre.

27:02.522 --> 27:04.888
Give me my rabbit's foot back.

27:14.826 --> 27:16.690
We get a lot
of abused women here.

27:16.725 --> 27:19.124
How do you love someone
who treats you like that?

27:19.158 --> 27:21.023
I know.
It makes no sense.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.692
But it's just sometimes
not that easy.

27:23.726 --> 27:24.893
Okay, well, tell me.

27:24.927 --> 27:27.294
How do you wake
a woman like that up?

27:27.329 --> 27:28.762
Everyone's different.

27:28.796 --> 27:31.097
Different factors are involved.

27:31.132 --> 27:33.166
So, can't choose
who you fall in love with?

27:33.200 --> 27:34.900
That kind of thing?

27:36.836 --> 27:39.570
I mean, you'd never stay
with someone who hit <i>you,</i> right?

27:39.604 --> 27:42.773
If any man ever abused me,
he'd be one of your cold cases.

27:42.807 --> 27:44.907
So, for some women,
murder's the only way out.

27:44.942 --> 27:46.942
Well,
at least they <i>think</i> so.

27:46.977 --> 27:50.412
But that only applies to women
who lost their support system

27:50.446 --> 27:53.080
or never had one
to begin with.

27:53.115 --> 27:55.882
Everyone needs a support system,
especially with kids.

27:55.916 --> 27:58.017
No one can make you leave,

27:58.051 --> 28:01.586
but if you don't have anyone
to help you get out,

28:01.620 --> 28:04.522
then you could stay
in a bad relationship forever.

28:04.556 --> 28:06.758
Support system, huh?

28:08.928 --> 28:10.998
So,
Jeff have a good time

28:11.032 --> 28:13.035
shooting unarmed,
innocent milk jugs?

28:13.069 --> 28:15.738
He did.
Thanks for asking me.

28:15.773 --> 28:16.973
He any good at it?

28:17.008 --> 28:18.342
Yeah, he's a natural.

28:18.376 --> 28:19.910
Great.

28:23.079 --> 28:24.613
Anyway, I should, um...

28:24.647 --> 28:26.147
Yeah,
I should get back at it.

28:26.181 --> 28:27.381
Thanks for the...Abuse.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.116
Yeah, no problem.

28:36.226 --> 28:39.227
Hey, you arrested their star player.
So they t-peed your car.

28:39.447 --> 28:42.367
I told you not to mess
with the big game in Muck City.

28:42.651 --> 28:44.118
Pahokee's revenge.

28:44.152 --> 28:45.486
Mm-hmm.
Game's tomorrow.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.188
When are you going to
release DeAndre?

28:47.222 --> 28:49.690
I'm raking the muck.
Muckraking's my new calling.

28:49.724 --> 28:50.991
Speaking of which,

28:51.025 --> 28:53.493
I got some more dirt
from my friend in Texas.

28:53.527 --> 28:55.562
Look, either charge DeAndre
or kick him.

28:55.596 --> 28:57.631
I will...
Just not yet.

28:57.666 --> 29:00.034
Really?

29:00.068 --> 29:03.604
What about Saturday night
for a round?

29:03.638 --> 29:06.440
Of course, it's shabbat.
How could I forget?

29:06.474 --> 29:08.475
Yeah,
Sunday afternoon it is.

29:08.510 --> 29:11.577
And I'll see about
those tee times.

29:11.611 --> 29:14.179
All right, Feldman.
Talk soon. Bye-bye.

29:14.213 --> 29:16.715
I can get us tee times
anytime we want.

29:16.749 --> 29:19.083
This isn't about you,
all right?

29:19.118 --> 29:21.652
You and I can play anytime.

29:21.686 --> 29:25.221
Yeah.
Busy solving a murder anyway.

29:25.256 --> 29:28.258
Any luck investigating those ligature marks?
Not yet.

29:28.292 --> 29:29.793
All right, any luck
finding the ring?

29:29.827 --> 29:31.362
No, I was gonna try pawnshops.

29:31.396 --> 29:33.163
No, it's too personal
an item to sell.

29:33.198 --> 29:34.932
Whoever took it must have known
how much it meant to Curtis.

29:34.966 --> 29:36.166
Whoever took it
was probably the killer.

29:36.201 --> 29:38.268
I understand why DeAndre
and his mother

29:38.303 --> 29:40.403
would want to kill Curtis,
but why now?

29:40.438 --> 29:41.671
Why not three years ago

29:41.705 --> 29:43.607
when the coward was still
using her as a punching bag?

29:43.641 --> 29:45.243
Curtis was gonna take DeAndre
back to Texas.

29:45.277 --> 29:47.446
How?
Asking for another chance.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.748
If that didn't work,
the law was on his side.

29:49.782 --> 29:51.784
Curtis filed papers
with the Texas court.

29:51.818 --> 29:54.353
He was gonna take action
against Rita for kidnapping.

29:54.387 --> 29:56.188
Why bother trying to bribe him
with his A.U. ring?

29:56.222 --> 29:57.956
Like most abusers,
he was delusional.

29:57.990 --> 29:59.658
Wanted DeAndre
to come willingly.

29:59.692 --> 30:00.892
Yeah,
but DeAndre said no.

30:00.927 --> 30:03.495
And Rita sure as hell
wasn't gonna help Curtis.

30:03.529 --> 30:06.264
I mean, who would he turn to?
Who's gonna help him?

30:06.299 --> 30:08.467
If only we had
DeAndre's phone.

30:08.501 --> 30:10.402
Oh, wait! We do.

30:17.276 --> 30:19.244
"'Sup, baby?"
Mnh-mnh.

30:19.279 --> 30:21.113
"Baby girl?"
Mm, mnh-mnh.

30:21.147 --> 30:24.082
"Bo."
No.

30:24.117 --> 30:25.717
"Hey, girl."

30:25.752 --> 30:27.419
"Hey, girl"?
Mm.

30:27.453 --> 30:29.220
"Hey, girl."

30:30.856 --> 30:34.792
"Cops planning
to check lockers."

30:37.563 --> 30:39.264
Oh, uh...

30:41.967 --> 30:43.935
I'll be right back.

31:10.031 --> 31:13.167
I believe you have
a ring for me.

31:14.769 --> 31:16.169
I'm not talking to you.

31:16.204 --> 31:18.505
Hey, if I killed someone,
I wouldn't talk to me, either.

31:18.539 --> 31:20.474
You're not gonna trick me
into saying something.

31:20.508 --> 31:21.775
I'm waiting
for my lawyer.

31:21.809 --> 31:23.510
Okay.

31:24.945 --> 31:28.680
Let's wait.

31:34.086 --> 31:36.388
But before your lawyer comes,
Crystal, you should know,

31:36.422 --> 31:38.223
you're in a world of trouble.

31:38.257 --> 31:40.591
Curtis was wearing this ring
the day he died.

31:40.626 --> 31:44.130
Only way you could've got it
is if the killer gave it to you.

31:44.164 --> 31:45.365
Then you're an accessory.

31:45.399 --> 31:47.301
Or you took it
off the body yourself.

31:47.335 --> 31:48.436
Then you're the killer.

31:48.470 --> 31:50.705
Either way -- whew! --
Not looking good for you.

31:50.739 --> 31:53.075
I was at practice,
and then I was with DeAndre.

31:53.109 --> 31:54.443
I wouldn't link my alibi

31:54.477 --> 31:56.111
to a guy who's already
sitting in jail.

31:56.145 --> 31:57.345
I didn't kill Mr. Taylor.

31:57.379 --> 31:59.379
He gave me the ring
to give to DeAndre.

31:59.414 --> 32:00.780
He wanted me
to convince DeAndre

32:00.814 --> 32:02.248
to move back to Texas
with him.

32:02.282 --> 32:04.649
Said he'd make sure that DeAndre
got to play football at A.U.

32:04.684 --> 32:07.351
You didn't want DeAndre to move
back to Texas with his dad.

32:07.385 --> 32:08.785
That's why you killed Curtis.

32:08.819 --> 32:10.853
No.
Yeah, it makes perfect sense.

32:10.888 --> 32:12.655
Colleges were recruiting DeAndre.

32:12.689 --> 32:14.223
He's got a shot at the NFL.

32:14.257 --> 32:16.425
That's your meal ticket
out of here, right?

32:16.459 --> 32:18.126
I only want
what's best for him.

32:18.161 --> 32:19.395
And for <i>you.</i>

32:19.429 --> 32:21.397
He goes back to Texas
with his dad, it's all over.

32:21.431 --> 32:24.266
You're wrong.
DeAndre loves me.

32:24.301 --> 32:27.237
And besides, he doesn't need
his daddy to go to A.U.

32:27.271 --> 32:28.872
If he really wanted to go,

32:28.906 --> 32:31.541
he'd ask Coach Ward, just like
he does with everything.

32:31.575 --> 32:33.143
Coach Ward is the one
that helped him

32:33.177 --> 32:35.411
get away from Texas and
come here in the first place.

32:37.681 --> 32:39.149
Excuse me.

32:47.458 --> 32:49.492
Can I leave?

32:51.863 --> 32:54.331
No, you can't.

32:56.168 --> 32:58.002
Thank you very much.

32:58.036 --> 32:59.337
Curtis Taylor wasn't
the only person

32:59.371 --> 33:00.571
that played at Austin University.

33:00.605 --> 33:02.340
You checked with their
Department of Athletics?

33:02.374 --> 33:04.675
Guess who else was listed
on exactly the same squad.

33:04.710 --> 33:07.911
Coach Ward.
He conveniently forgot to mention that earlier.

33:07.946 --> 33:09.546
Yeah.

33:11.849 --> 33:14.417
We're in the middle
of a strategy session.

33:14.452 --> 33:16.886
We lost one of our best players,
as you know.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.055
Rabbit stew.

33:20.658 --> 33:24.361
We make it every year
before the game.

33:24.395 --> 33:27.264
Well, you'll be happy to know
DeAndre Matthews has been unarrested.

33:27.299 --> 33:28.833
Oh, you hear that,
guys?

33:28.867 --> 33:30.868
DeAndre can play.
That's great news.

33:30.902 --> 33:33.804
What's not so great is you lying about not
knowing Curtis Taylor.

33:33.838 --> 33:37.240
Hey, fellas, uh,
give us a minute here.

33:37.274 --> 33:39.842
All right,
let's go outside.

33:47.986 --> 33:50.655
A.U. football, 1993.

33:50.689 --> 33:52.857
Same team, same year.

33:52.892 --> 33:55.860
Different experience.
Curtis was a star.

33:55.895 --> 33:57.162
Your ass
was warming the bench.

33:57.196 --> 33:58.697
Should've tried out for
the cheerleading team with Rita.

33:58.731 --> 34:00.032
You might have
had a chance.

34:00.066 --> 34:03.402
I played.
In practice, maybe. What, two games?

34:03.436 --> 34:04.803
No wonder you don't
wear your ring.

34:04.837 --> 34:06.304
You didn't earn it
the way Curtis did.

34:06.338 --> 34:08.005
I may not have played
as good as Curtis,

34:08.041 --> 34:09.641
but I know the game
better than anyone.

34:09.675 --> 34:10.909
And look
who's winning now.

34:10.944 --> 34:12.811
Yeah,
but not back then.

34:12.846 --> 34:15.848
Two months after graduation,
Rita's Curtis' wife.

34:15.882 --> 34:18.717
We pulled Curtis' phone records
from four years ago.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.554
You called his house at least,
what, twice a month?

34:21.589 --> 34:24.757
Yeah, but not
to talk to Curtis.

34:24.792 --> 34:27.061
You rang to talk to Rita.

34:27.094 --> 34:28.762
You knew
he was no good for her.

34:28.797 --> 34:31.032
You were hoping one day
she'd dump the loser husband.

34:31.065 --> 34:33.167
You were trying to get her
out of a bad marriage.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.936
You came a father figure
to her son.

34:34.969 --> 34:37.105
You were trying to steal another
man's family away from them.

34:38.940 --> 34:41.976
Not that there's anything
wrong with that.

34:42.011 --> 34:44.612
We have a warrant to search your premises.
What?

34:54.992 --> 34:56.292
After you.

35:02.548 --> 35:04.883
Detectives.
How you doing, man?

35:08.687 --> 35:09.588
What? Let's go.

35:09.605 --> 35:11.875
Why does the coach have an
O.K. Sugar employee parking pass

35:11.909 --> 35:13.711
on his windshield?

35:13.746 --> 35:15.848
Ooh.

35:15.883 --> 35:18.086
Haul a lot of dead weight
with that.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.522
I don't know about Chicago,
but in this part of the world,

35:20.556 --> 35:22.924
you need a winch to haul all
sorts of stuff out of the muck.

35:22.958 --> 35:24.291
Or bury it.

35:24.325 --> 35:26.159
Hey!
What you doing to my truck?

35:26.194 --> 35:27.361
What are you doing
to that trash?

35:27.396 --> 35:28.463
I'm helping the coach out.

35:28.498 --> 35:30.432
Well, you're not
helping him out inside.

35:30.466 --> 35:32.267
That job looks like something
for the assistant

35:32.301 --> 35:33.802
to the assistant
of the assistant coaches.

35:33.836 --> 35:37.339
Just don't touch my truck.
No problem.

35:42.912 --> 35:44.378
Small problem.

35:44.413 --> 35:46.383
Our warrant doesn't cover
his truck,

35:46.417 --> 35:48.654
only evidence recovered
<i>inside</i> of the residence.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.221
Oh, yeah?

35:55.192 --> 35:57.225
Good enough for me.

36:01.431 --> 36:03.299
The ligature marking
on Curtis' neck

36:03.333 --> 36:05.034
matched the patterns
on the winch.

36:05.068 --> 36:07.369
Daniel looked at ropes
and chains, not cables.

36:07.404 --> 36:08.938
Hmm.
Can't wait to tell him.

36:08.972 --> 36:10.909
If Curtis' body was
in the back of Ron's truck,

36:10.943 --> 36:12.344
his DNA's gonna be all over it.

36:12.378 --> 36:15.781
If? I found skin and blood
on the winch and in the flatbed.

36:15.815 --> 36:18.050
Also on the skin
were traces of lye.

36:18.084 --> 36:20.219
Just like on the body.
That's weird.

36:20.253 --> 36:22.588
It's not weird.
It's evidence.

36:22.622 --> 36:23.956
It's hard to believe Ron
would be so desperate

36:23.990 --> 36:25.223
to be part of the team
that he'd kill someone.

36:25.258 --> 36:27.092
Not if Coach Ward
put him up to it.

36:27.126 --> 36:29.261
Some people will do anything
to get ahead.

36:31.030 --> 36:33.798
What?
Esther Feldman's Bat Mitzvah.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.066
Yeah?

36:35.101 --> 36:37.335
Esther Feldman,
as in daughter to Ben Feldman.

36:37.369 --> 36:40.738
<i>Judge</i> Ben Feldman.
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Ben <i>is</i> a judge.

36:40.773 --> 36:42.941
Judge Ben Feldman. He's on
the FDLE advancement committee.

36:42.975 --> 36:44.575
Is he? Hmm.
I didn't know that.

36:44.610 --> 36:47.078
You're Chief Medical Examiner.
What's next?

36:47.112 --> 36:49.414
President of death?
Keeper of corpses?

36:49.448 --> 36:51.616
What? You can't be promoted
anymore.

36:51.650 --> 36:52.750
I like meeting new people.

36:52.785 --> 36:53.885
No, you don't.
You're like me.

36:53.919 --> 36:55.620
No, I'm not.
And <i>that's</i> why you're alone.

36:55.654 --> 36:57.588
It's Marisol, isn't it?

36:57.622 --> 36:59.089
You're networking
to please your wife.

36:59.124 --> 37:01.157
That's what happens
when the Coast Guard rescues you

37:01.192 --> 37:02.692
with just your clothes
on your back.

37:02.726 --> 37:05.628
You want crazy things,
like success.

37:05.662 --> 37:07.696
And all off the back
of little Esther Feldman.

37:07.731 --> 37:09.399
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself,

37:09.433 --> 37:11.669
using a 12-year-old kid
to win points with a woman.

37:11.703 --> 37:12.903
Back at you, big daddy.

37:12.938 --> 37:14.305
For the record?
Mm-hmm.

37:14.339 --> 37:15.473
Jeff turned 13 today.

37:15.507 --> 37:16.441
Really?

37:16.475 --> 37:17.508
Mm-hmm.

37:17.543 --> 37:19.276
And, yeah,
I would do anything for him,

37:19.311 --> 37:21.278
even kill if I had to,

37:21.312 --> 37:23.580
but I got no reason
to kill Curtis Taylor.

37:23.614 --> 37:25.182
But Coach Ward does.

37:25.216 --> 37:27.450
Hey, that's a good man
you're talking about.

37:27.485 --> 37:28.818
So I keep hearing.

37:28.853 --> 37:30.687
You know what Coach Ward
said about <i>you.</i>

37:30.721 --> 37:32.121
Night of the murder,
you left practice early.

37:32.156 --> 37:33.256
Where'd you go?

37:33.290 --> 37:35.491
Had some personal business
to attend to.

37:35.526 --> 37:36.659
Personal business, Ron?

37:36.693 --> 37:38.628
Sounds like a bit
of an oxymoron.

37:39.863 --> 37:41.563
She told me not to tell.

37:43.166 --> 37:45.434
My ex-wife.
We were having sex.

37:45.469 --> 37:47.870
Really?
Yeah, surprised me, too.

37:47.904 --> 37:49.938
So, sex with the ex
isn't a regular occurrence.

37:49.973 --> 37:54.075
No. She came on to me
over at the practice field.

37:54.110 --> 37:55.476
Damn good-looking, too.

37:55.511 --> 37:57.345
She had her hair done
and everything.

37:57.379 --> 37:59.513
I mean, I wasn't gonna pass up
a chance to hit that again.

37:59.547 --> 38:04.151
So you see why I can't tell you
who it is, don't you?

38:04.185 --> 38:07.087
Oh, being a gentleman, you wouldn't
want to besmirch a lady's reputation

38:07.121 --> 38:09.457
in case you wanted to hit that again --
I get it.

38:13.562 --> 38:15.463
We're closed.
This'll only take a minute.

38:15.498 --> 38:16.998
Hey, no, the game's
about to start.

38:17.032 --> 38:19.300
And DeAndre's playing tonight.
Ooh! Thank the lord.

38:19.335 --> 38:20.902
We gonna kick some ass
tonight.

38:27.176 --> 38:29.811
Found out from a clerk
that Curtis had filed papers

38:29.846 --> 38:31.313
to bring DeAndre back to Texas.

38:31.347 --> 38:33.314
Well, you couldn't
let <i>that</i> happen.

38:33.349 --> 38:34.482
Come on, I don't want to
miss the kickoff.

38:34.516 --> 38:35.850
If we got to go,
you got to go.

38:35.884 --> 38:38.352
I didn't think a woman was
strong enough to kill Curtis,

38:38.387 --> 38:39.753
but <i>three</i> women?

38:39.788 --> 38:41.655
I did not see that.

38:41.689 --> 38:44.591
You guys are
Rita's support network.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.659
You each bring something
different to the party.

38:46.694 --> 38:48.361
Crystal's your granddaughter,
right?

38:48.395 --> 38:49.595
You keep Crystal out of this.

38:49.629 --> 38:51.497
It's okay, Remelle.
Don't let him get to you.

38:51.531 --> 38:53.299
You told Curtis
that Crystal wanted

38:53.334 --> 38:55.569
to talk to him about DeAndre,
so he came here.

38:55.603 --> 38:57.773
Probably sat
in this chair...

38:57.807 --> 39:00.676
Where you whacked him
over the head

39:00.710 --> 39:02.611
with your little friend here.

39:02.645 --> 39:05.013
Then...

39:05.048 --> 39:08.684
You wheeled him
over to the sink,

39:08.718 --> 39:11.687
where you drowned him
in soapy water,

39:11.721 --> 39:13.388
with traces of lye.

39:15.258 --> 39:17.125
"C.J.'s hair relaxer."

39:17.160 --> 39:19.928
Main ingredient
Lye.

39:19.963 --> 39:21.697
But you needed a way
to move the body,

39:21.731 --> 39:24.066
which is why Vivian's been having sex
with her ex-husband, Ron,

39:24.100 --> 39:26.735
'cause you needed his truck
with a winch.

39:26.769 --> 39:28.570
Don't worry.
He's been a complete gentleman.

39:28.604 --> 39:30.504
Left your name out of it
till the end.

39:30.539 --> 39:32.006
But he did tell you

39:32.040 --> 39:34.108
when the next controlled burn
was scheduled.

39:34.142 --> 39:38.811
Only...You guys didn't plan
on the wind changing.

39:38.846 --> 39:40.613
You can't prove any of this.

39:48.988 --> 39:51.324
Do all your customers
bleed so much?

39:55.998 --> 39:57.666
Whoop-whoop.

40:10.913 --> 40:12.814
Going to the game?

40:12.849 --> 40:15.350
Can't.
Late for a party.

40:15.384 --> 40:17.952
Declan, you do know
that's a girl's bike, right?

40:17.987 --> 40:20.255
What can I say?
Ladies love the rabbit prince.

40:20.289 --> 40:23.625
You knew who that dead body was,
didn't you?

40:23.659 --> 40:26.027
Yeah, he bought
one of my rabbits,

40:26.061 --> 40:27.528
asked if I knew DeAndre.

40:27.563 --> 40:29.263
He even gave me his card.

40:29.298 --> 40:30.431
Why didn't you tell me?

40:30.466 --> 40:32.367
I didn't want DeAndre
to get in trouble.

40:32.401 --> 40:34.235
Besides, I knew
you'd figure it out.

40:34.269 --> 40:35.603
You the Five-O, man.

40:38.874 --> 40:40.574
Didn't even need it.

40:53.722 --> 40:56.457
No way. No way!
It's an Xbox 360!

40:56.491 --> 40:58.025
Oh, my gosh, mom!
Thank you so much.

40:58.059 --> 41:01.361
Yeah, yeah, that's, um,
not from me, kiddo.

41:01.396 --> 41:02.963
Who's it from?

41:02.997 --> 41:04.398
I have no idea.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.736
Excuse me.

41:08.770 --> 41:11.605
Ah. I see I came
at the right time.

41:11.639 --> 41:13.373
That was too expensive.

41:13.408 --> 41:15.442
Well, I can't justify
buying it for myself.

41:15.477 --> 41:17.812
This way, I get to come
over here and play it.

41:19.781 --> 41:21.415
Uh,
can I call you later?

41:21.450 --> 41:23.350
'Cause we're kind of
in the middle of something.

41:23.385 --> 41:25.285
Jeff didn't tell you?
Tell me...?

41:25.320 --> 41:27.153
He invited me to his party.

41:27.188 --> 41:28.888
He said
you're okay with it.

41:28.922 --> 41:31.023
But you know what?
If it's a problem...

41:31.058 --> 41:33.626
No, I mean,
his grandma's here.

41:33.660 --> 41:34.927
Ah.

41:34.962 --> 41:37.396
Oh, my gosh.
Dude, thank you so much.

41:37.431 --> 41:38.865
I take it you like it,
huh?

41:38.899 --> 41:40.200
Oh, my gosh.
It's awesome.

41:40.234 --> 41:43.536
Drinks are in the kitchen,
so I'll go set up a game.

41:43.571 --> 41:45.439
All right?

41:45.473 --> 41:50.244
I'm sorry to interrupt, but, uh,
your daddy's on the phone.

41:50.279 --> 41:52.246
And he'd like to wish you
a Happy Birthday.

41:52.281 --> 41:53.347
All right, great.

41:53.382 --> 41:56.618
But why don't you take it
in the other room?

41:56.652 --> 41:58.920
That way,
y'all will have more privacy.

41:58.955 --> 42:01.156
Okay, um,
you set the game up.

42:01.190 --> 42:03.792
I'm player number one.
Oh, hey, Jeff, you know what?

42:03.826 --> 42:04.992
Uh, next time, man.

42:05.026 --> 42:07.025
I just came by
to say Happy Birthday.

42:07.059 --> 42:08.091
You know.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.791
Yeah, see?
Office never sleeps.

42:10.825 --> 42:12.659
Okay, well, thank you.

42:12.693 --> 42:15.194
All right.
Happy Birthday.
Thanks.

42:15.229 --> 42:17.330
Thanks.

42:17.364 --> 42:18.898
Hey, Ray.

42:18.932 --> 42:21.500
Oh, yeah,
birthday boy's right here.
