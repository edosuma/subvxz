WEBVTT

00:00.013 --> 00:02.713
Previously on "Cardinal".

00:02.748 --> 00:04.715
The bullet entered the
victim's left temporal lobe.

00:04.750 --> 00:06.918
So lobotomy by gunshot.

00:06.953 --> 00:07.919
What do you see?

00:07.954 --> 00:09.486
Over there. Moons.

00:09.522 --> 00:10.487
Got it.

00:10.523 --> 00:11.555
Do you know her?

00:11.590 --> 00:12.857
I don't think so.

00:12.892 --> 00:14.826
What about hanging
around the Northern Raiders?

00:14.861 --> 00:16.059
Your biker friends.

00:16.094 --> 00:17.728
I haven't been around them in six months.

00:17.763 --> 00:18.995
We leave Friday morning,

00:19.031 --> 00:20.331
back Sunday night.

00:20.366 --> 00:21.332
You sure about this?

00:21.367 --> 00:22.833
You don't need to worry.

00:22.868 --> 00:24.134
I want to apply for training

00:24.169 --> 00:25.736
with the National Intelligence Service.

00:25.771 --> 00:27.438
You put National Intelligence Service

00:27.473 --> 00:29.573
on the resume and sky's the limit.

00:29.608 --> 00:31.308
You gonna tank your career for Cardinal?

00:31.344 --> 00:32.576
Who knew you had this gun?

00:32.610 --> 00:33.743
My friend Dave.

00:33.778 --> 00:35.511
I haven't seen Dave in almost two weeks.

00:35.547 --> 00:36.947
Is this the boat he's out on?

00:36.982 --> 00:38.315
Yeah. The "Muskee-Doe".

00:38.350 --> 00:39.983
The sooner she remembers who she is-

00:40.018 --> 00:41.651
She hasn't forgotten who she is.

00:41.686 --> 00:44.821
She just can't retrieve
the information right now.

00:44.857 --> 00:45.822
Where was that photo taken?

00:45.858 --> 00:46.823
Beaufort Hill.

00:46.859 --> 00:47.924
I got something.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.959
A cave by the waterfall.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:14.018 --> 01:17.186
There's way fewer
maggots than I'd expect.

01:17.221 --> 01:19.454
Found another one of these in the bush.

01:19.490 --> 01:20.890
Looks like blood.

01:20.925 --> 01:22.924
We'll test it against the victim's.

01:23.827 --> 01:25.627
Not much blood on the ground.

01:25.662 --> 01:27.662
This might not be the kill site.

01:31.702 --> 01:36.037
Ah, this is some sort of sacrifice.

01:36.072 --> 01:37.972
A ritual.

01:38.008 --> 01:41.009
Okay. You guys could come
on over and take a closer look now.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.313
Genitalia's been removed.

01:45.348 --> 01:46.547
Mhm.

01:47.850 --> 01:49.450
Compass rose.

01:51.721 --> 01:54.389
Same as the one in the
photo at the marina.

01:54.424 --> 01:56.056
You know who it is?

01:58.861 --> 02:00.562
Dave Elhurst.

02:00.930 --> 02:04.832
Our only suspect in a
shooting three days ago.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.266
Lise.

02:10.072 --> 02:12.372
When Red was in surgery,

02:12.408 --> 02:14.007
she said,

02:14.043 --> 02:16.209
"Over there. Pointing.

02:16.245 --> 02:17.644
Moons."

02:21.216 --> 02:22.615
I found this.

02:23.885 --> 02:25.252
The nearest train tracks are at least

02:25.287 --> 02:26.719
six kilometres away.

02:27.823 --> 02:30.857
Not exactly sharp enough
to be a murder weapon.

02:30.892 --> 02:32.892
Doesn't mean the killer didn't bring it.

02:35.296 --> 02:37.296
Ugh, you called?

02:39.000 --> 02:40.299
Yeah, I uh,

02:40.335 --> 02:42.401
I wanted you to have a look at this.

02:55.984 --> 02:57.316
Good thing you called me, man.

02:57.352 --> 02:59.385
See? I knew it had to be a Native thing.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.752
Oh yeah, definitely.

03:00.788 --> 03:03.125
Okay. So,

03:04.692 --> 03:06.492
what do the markings mean?

03:06.527 --> 03:08.961
Well, they refer to time and space.

03:08.996 --> 03:11.262
Roughly translates to

03:11.298 --> 03:12.998
"I'll meet you at Tim Hortons,

03:13.033 --> 03:14.867
three p.m. on Saturday."

03:16.136 --> 03:17.102
I don't know,

03:17.137 --> 03:18.669
I'm not an expert on cave drawings, Ian.

03:18.705 --> 03:19.971
You know, believe it or not,

03:20.007 --> 03:22.007
with all those bows and arrows and stuff,

03:23.143 --> 03:24.642
you might want to talk to somebody

03:24.677 --> 03:26.311
in Behavioural Sciences.

03:26.346 --> 03:27.945
We've got a guy at OPD.

03:27.981 --> 03:28.946
I'll hook you up.

03:28.982 --> 03:30.181
Yeah.

03:44.397 --> 03:46.397
So, you really
think Red was in that cave.

03:49.168 --> 03:51.002
I hope not.

04:29.013 --> 04:37.046
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

05:07.745 --> 05:08.977
For Catherine.

05:09.793 --> 05:11.503
How'd your interview go?

05:12.796 --> 05:14.115
I won't get it.

05:15.051 --> 05:16.450
Beautiful morning.

05:17.453 --> 05:18.527
Dr. Chin,

05:18.562 --> 05:19.887
Detective Lise Delorme.

05:20.423 --> 05:21.623
Cardinal.

05:22.258 --> 05:24.859
You looked at the bugs
we found on our victim?

05:24.894 --> 05:26.594
Mainly Phormia Regina.

05:26.630 --> 05:28.529
A blowfly, common everywhere.

05:28.564 --> 05:31.765
Then there was Calliphora
Vicina, which is rarer.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.800
They mostly go places
that are shady and cool.

05:34.670 --> 05:37.154
I assume that fits with the crime scene?

05:37.740 --> 05:39.373
Your body also contained maggots

05:39.408 --> 05:41.275
of Cynomoyopsis Cadavarina,

05:41.310 --> 05:42.809
or the shiny bluebottle.

05:42.845 --> 05:44.445
You only get that fly in the

05:44.480 --> 05:45.979
advanced stages of decay.

05:46.015 --> 05:48.248
But those were the only
three species we found.

05:48.283 --> 05:49.315
You're surprised.

05:49.351 --> 05:51.484
Well, normally, you'd
expect a lot more species

05:51.520 --> 05:52.819
at an outdoor site.

05:52.855 --> 05:54.254
Especially in the late stages.

05:54.289 --> 05:56.556
The body was found in a-a cave.

05:56.591 --> 05:57.557
Near water?

05:57.592 --> 05:58.558
Yeah.

05:59.009 --> 06:00.627
The flies didn't smell the body.

06:00.663 --> 06:02.095
Didn't even know it was there.

06:02.131 --> 06:04.297
The bugs you did find.

06:04.332 --> 06:05.665
Can they give us time of death?

06:05.700 --> 06:08.067
Yes, thanks to the bluebottle.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.269
Your victim was killed approximately

06:09.304 --> 06:10.503
twelve days ago.

06:13.508 --> 06:14.474
Thanks.

06:14.509 --> 06:16.342
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

06:19.981 --> 06:21.346
Dave was already missing his head

06:21.382 --> 06:22.815
when Red was shot.

06:24.052 --> 06:25.751
So he didn't shoot her.

06:25.787 --> 06:27.787
But he crossed paths with whoever did.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.112
You were gone early.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.980
Yeah, I went up Beaufort Hill.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.917
Cops have been there.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.696
Yeah, I heard.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.888
They only found one body.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.192
Told you that girl was still alive.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.538
But you said she was dead.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.529
She is, Ray.

07:11.564 --> 07:13.231
She's halfway down the hillside.

07:13.666 --> 07:14.898
In the trees.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.502
Surprised that the, uh,

07:20.340 --> 07:21.739
cops didn't find her.

07:23.175 --> 07:24.375
Yeah.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.211
Ah, anyways,

07:27.645 --> 07:29.245
I buried her deep.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.490
I know you've been wanting to ask.

07:40.525 --> 07:41.725
Go ahead.

07:45.597 --> 07:46.796
Jesus.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.034
Must've hurt like a mother!

07:52.070 --> 07:54.904
Every crack of my whip
brought me into my power.

07:57.709 --> 07:59.541
You did that to yourself?

08:00.851 --> 08:02.284
Discipline, Leon.

08:03.882 --> 08:05.882
Mind, body and spirit.

08:08.386 --> 08:10.473
We have appetites,

08:10.889 --> 08:12.721
you and me.

08:22.232 --> 08:23.399
How's her memory coming?

08:23.434 --> 08:25.200
Short term's improving.

08:25.235 --> 08:27.603
Nothing before her trauma.

08:27.638 --> 08:29.705
Will it all come back at once?

08:29.740 --> 08:31.774
Every case is unique.

08:31.809 --> 08:34.308
Memories are stored in
many traces in the brain.

08:34.344 --> 08:36.344
Some more accessible than others.

08:43.253 --> 08:44.419
How ya feeling?

08:44.454 --> 08:46.288
Well, someone tried to kill me.

08:47.457 --> 08:49.123
I don't know if it was some

08:49.158 --> 08:50.625
rando, or my boyfriend,

08:50.660 --> 08:54.061
or if I even have a boyfriend.

08:54.096 --> 08:55.935
We're working on that.

08:56.866 --> 08:59.689
Just try to relax.

09:05.274 --> 09:07.107
Do they think that I'm dead?

09:10.279 --> 09:12.279
Or are they going to try again?

09:43.813 --> 09:45.546
You're going in early.

09:45.581 --> 09:47.548
I was trying not to wake you.

09:47.583 --> 09:48.983
Birds beat you to it.

09:51.988 --> 09:53.420
You need anything

09:54.457 --> 09:56.390
for your trip?

09:56.425 --> 09:57.831
I'm all set.

10:00.162 --> 10:05.130
I-I'm thinking about taking
a break from therapy.

10:07.035 --> 10:08.869
Don't look at me like that.

10:13.008 --> 10:15.909
I mean, you've said that in the past.

10:15.944 --> 10:17.277
God, John. Relax.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.411
I'm not saying I won't go back.

10:18.446 --> 10:19.846
Well then what's the problem, then?

10:19.882 --> 10:20.847
Is it-

10:20.883 --> 10:22.515
Is it Dr. Bell?

10:22.550 --> 10:25.018
No. I-I feel like I'm going
over the same things,

10:25.053 --> 10:26.019
again and again.

10:26.054 --> 10:28.755
I'm-I'm so sick of hearing myself talk.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.623
I just need a break.

10:35.797 --> 10:37.630
I think it's a bad idea.

10:55.249 --> 10:56.548
All right,

10:56.583 --> 10:58.184
remember to keep your skin covered,

10:58.219 --> 10:59.451
Black flies.

10:59.486 --> 11:00.686
Have fun!

11:18.504 --> 11:19.804
Hey Marci.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.039
Where's Dave?

11:21.875 --> 11:23.274
I don't-I don't know.

11:27.047 --> 11:28.246
Come here!

11:30.516 --> 11:31.549
Look,

11:31.584 --> 11:33.084
I swear that I don't know where he is.

11:33.119 --> 11:34.084
He just took off-

11:34.119 --> 11:35.686
He just took off on his boat.

11:49.702 --> 11:50.734
Tell him the Northern Raiders

11:50.769 --> 11:52.202
are looking for him.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.010
All right.

12:00.045 --> 12:01.444
Two victims:

12:02.714 --> 12:03.847
one dead marina owner,

12:03.883 --> 12:05.916
and one living Jane Doe.

12:05.951 --> 12:07.684
Are you thinking it's one case?

12:07.719 --> 12:09.085
Two completely different M.O.'s.

12:09.120 --> 12:11.588
Dave Elhurst stole
the make and model of gun

12:11.623 --> 12:13.089
that put a bullet in Red.

12:13.124 --> 12:15.024
And we only found him because of her.

12:15.059 --> 12:17.260
We're still working on how and when

12:17.295 --> 12:18.695
Red came to town.

12:18.730 --> 12:20.963
Ah, there's no record of
her coming by bus or train

12:20.999 --> 12:23.032
and there's no overdue rental cars.

12:23.067 --> 12:24.633
We need to cast a wider net.

12:24.668 --> 12:26.202
Gas stations between Pearson Airport

12:26.237 --> 12:27.436
and Algonquin Bay.

12:27.471 --> 12:29.205
That's a huge net.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.306
Mhm.

12:30.341 --> 12:31.340
I'll get started.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.376
Where are we with Dave Elhurst?

12:33.411 --> 12:35.211
Ah, search of his house
turned up nothing.

12:35.246 --> 12:36.545
We don't see Marci cutting him up,

12:36.580 --> 12:38.281
but we've asked her and Dave's friends

12:38.316 --> 12:39.715
to account for their whereabouts.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.116
And still no sign of his boat?

12:41.151 --> 12:42.117
Not yet.

12:42.152 --> 12:44.252
But Jerry Commanda
offered us an OPD boat.

12:44.288 --> 12:45.788
We'll cover more territory.

12:46.082 --> 12:47.456
What about VICLAS?

12:47.491 --> 12:49.257
I searched bodies with missing parts,

12:49.293 --> 12:50.459
plus the pictographs.

12:50.494 --> 12:51.760
No hits.

12:51.796 --> 12:53.962
But when I searched
just missing body parts,

12:53.997 --> 12:56.175
I found a few unsolved
cases from Toronto.

12:57.719 --> 12:59.067
Keep us posted.

12:59.102 --> 13:00.068
That's it.

13:00.103 --> 13:01.702
Let's get to work.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.508
Dave's autopsy?

13:07.544 --> 13:09.377
I'll stay on his financials.

13:16.820 --> 13:18.281
Detective Delorme.

13:20.490 --> 13:21.689
Marci?

13:37.206 --> 13:39.260
Any preliminaries you can share?

13:41.643 --> 13:44.044
Well, the torso's got,
uh, two puncture wounds

13:44.080 --> 13:45.912
from when he was suspended in the cave.

13:47.516 --> 13:48.782
What about these?

13:48.817 --> 13:49.783
Ah, they're smaller,

13:49.818 --> 13:51.651
about one inch in diameter.

13:51.687 --> 13:53.854
Ah, the sharpened sticks
we found at the scene.

13:53.889 --> 13:55.088
Very possibly.

13:55.858 --> 13:57.858
Genitals were removed
by a serrated blade.

13:57.893 --> 13:59.092
Pre mortem.

14:00.061 --> 14:01.895
Including draining the body of any blood.

14:03.764 --> 14:07.000
Like you'd string up a deer?

14:07.035 --> 14:08.868
Ideally, the deer would be dead first.

14:10.271 --> 14:13.373
But I'll leave the metaphors
to the poets and detectives.

14:13.408 --> 14:15.588
So why take the blood and the body parts?

14:25.252 --> 14:27.252
♪ Little girlie,

14:28.856 --> 14:30.856
where are you? ♪

14:43.237 --> 14:45.070
Come on. Come on!

14:47.641 --> 14:48.606
Anybody comes around here

14:48.642 --> 14:49.841
asking about a little redhead girl,

14:49.876 --> 14:51.243
you give me a call, okay?

14:51.278 --> 14:52.544
- Okay.
- Hey.

14:52.579 --> 14:53.978
Just me.

15:27.476 --> 15:28.743
Sweet bike.

15:28.778 --> 15:30.778
Yeah, I found it in the woods over there.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.299
Man, we hit the jackpot.

15:34.509 --> 15:35.708
I mean, free food,

15:36.018 --> 15:37.217
free rent.

15:38.292 --> 15:39.692
You know?

15:43.439 --> 15:44.405
Ah, no thanks.

15:44.430 --> 15:46.263
Shit, I forgot. My bad.

15:49.683 --> 15:50.883
Hey uh,

15:52.853 --> 15:54.452
they tell you anything else about

15:54.488 --> 15:55.854
how it's going down later?

15:55.890 --> 15:56.955
Leon doesn't tell me shit

15:56.991 --> 15:57.956
when you're not around.

15:57.992 --> 15:59.825
Yeah. He's not a big talker, huh.

16:02.496 --> 16:04.396
What are you gonna do with your share?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.364
Head back west.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.451
What like, for like for a holiday?

16:09.369 --> 16:10.568
No.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.043
When I was using, I uh-

16:19.246 --> 16:20.678
I hurt people.

16:22.849 --> 16:24.048
Boys.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.055
Leon's back with pizza.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.721
Sweet.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.225
Come on.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.460
Yeah.

16:39.032 --> 16:40.497
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:40.533 --> 16:43.400
I had a talk with Commanda's
Behavioural Sciences guy

16:43.436 --> 16:44.901
and he feels we're dealing with

16:44.937 --> 16:47.604
an Afro-Caribbean spiritual practice.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.005
Voodoo or Santeria?

16:49.041 --> 16:50.274
He's never seen anything like it.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.828
He suggests we consult
an expert in the field.

16:53.212 --> 16:54.411
Hm.

16:55.047 --> 16:58.042
Well, Dave Elhurst was
in financial trouble.

16:58.316 --> 17:00.316
Until about eight months ago.

17:01.152 --> 17:02.251
And now he's in the black?

17:02.287 --> 17:03.486
Mhm.

17:04.823 --> 17:05.955
Suddenly flush.

17:05.991 --> 17:07.356
Cash business.

17:07.392 --> 17:10.526
The biker intimidating
Marci at the marina:

17:10.561 --> 17:11.728
Dave was laundering money

17:11.762 --> 17:13.596
for the Northern Raiders.

17:14.999 --> 17:16.832
This is why NIS needs you.

17:23.474 --> 17:25.944
Maybe Dave crossed paths with the bikers.

17:27.678 --> 17:29.712
Stole his friend's gun and took off.

17:29.747 --> 17:31.947
If the bikers killed Dave,

17:31.983 --> 17:33.983
why is one of them looking for him?

17:35.152 --> 17:37.252
Could be one of them went rogue,

17:37.287 --> 17:39.588
killed him without the club's knowledge.

17:39.624 --> 17:41.289
Or they're covering their tracks.

17:41.325 --> 17:43.826
Maybe Dave saw something
he shouldn't have.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.293
Maybe Red did too.

17:46.997 --> 17:50.886
Dave's crime scene
doesn't feel like bikers.

17:51.502 --> 17:52.934
Shot to the girl's head.

17:53.770 --> 17:55.470
To me, that fits.

17:55.506 --> 17:56.976
Execution-style.

17:59.176 --> 18:00.275
Maybe we're trying to draw a line

18:00.310 --> 18:02.010
where there isn't one.

18:02.045 --> 18:03.911
Is that the biker that threatened Marci?

18:03.947 --> 18:05.146
Mhm.

18:06.950 --> 18:08.082
I know a guy at OPD.

18:08.118 --> 18:09.684
Alan Clegg.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.318
If this guy's with the Raiders,

18:11.807 --> 18:13.440
he'll know him.

18:19.529 --> 18:20.961
That's Bryan Giblin.

18:20.996 --> 18:22.663
Goes by "Wombat".

18:22.698 --> 18:24.831
He's an enforcer for the
Northern Raiders biker gang.

18:24.867 --> 18:26.967
He killed those dealers
in Mattawa last year.

18:27.002 --> 18:28.169
What's he doing out?

18:28.204 --> 18:29.336
He never went in.

18:29.372 --> 18:31.104
Scott Lasalle, who runs the Raiders,

18:31.140 --> 18:33.207
made sure that one of
his low level initiates

18:33.242 --> 18:34.208
took the fall.

18:34.243 --> 18:36.877
He was looking for our Vic, Dave Elhurst.

18:36.912 --> 18:38.344
Owns the marina.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.113
We think Dave was laundering money

18:40.149 --> 18:42.015
for the Northern Raiders.

18:42.051 --> 18:43.616
I've been working the
Raiders for three years.

18:43.652 --> 18:45.251
I never heard of the guy.

18:46.354 --> 18:47.860
Well Mr. Elhurst

18:48.691 --> 18:50.323
is out of the game now.

18:51.994 --> 18:53.293
Oh Christ.

18:53.328 --> 18:55.701
Does that look like
Raiders' handiwork to you?

18:57.065 --> 18:58.898
Well, if he crossed Lasalle

18:59.767 --> 19:01.601
I wouldn't put it past them.

19:11.245 --> 19:12.578
Scott Lasalle?

19:12.613 --> 19:13.579
Yeah.

19:13.614 --> 19:15.014
We're looking for a friend of yours.

19:15.049 --> 19:16.048
Bryan Giblin,

19:16.084 --> 19:17.649
also known as Wombat.

19:17.685 --> 19:19.651
Well I can't help you there.

19:19.687 --> 19:20.886
But, um,

19:21.222 --> 19:24.724
we've got a new wheat ale
on tap if you want a beer.

19:24.759 --> 19:26.592
Its got a hint of honey in it.

19:27.294 --> 19:28.660
He was looking for Dave Elhurst

19:28.696 --> 19:30.529
at the marina yesterday.

19:31.432 --> 19:32.864
Okay.

19:32.899 --> 19:34.566
We want to talk to Dave
in connection with a shooting.

19:34.602 --> 19:36.668
But somebody got to him first.

19:36.704 --> 19:38.103
Took his head.

19:38.706 --> 19:40.105
And other parts.

19:40.541 --> 19:42.373
Am I supposed to know this Dave guy?

19:42.408 --> 19:43.441
His profits have gone way up

19:43.476 --> 19:46.577
since your club started
renting boats there.

19:46.613 --> 19:48.613
Happy to support the local businesses.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.283
We'll need your whereabouts between

19:52.318 --> 19:54.343
May 29 and June 4.

19:55.155 --> 19:56.988
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

19:57.457 --> 19:59.790
If you're talk to Mr. Giblin,

19:59.825 --> 20:01.459
have him call us.

20:18.778 --> 20:20.410
Who took him out?

20:21.080 --> 20:22.279
Not us.

20:23.115 --> 20:24.447
I'll find 'em.

20:24.483 --> 20:25.682
Set 'em straight.

20:26.518 --> 20:28.335
We need a new cleaner.

20:29.255 --> 20:30.654
Want me to find somebody?

20:34.326 --> 20:36.159
No, you gotta be with Crowchild.

20:36.995 --> 20:38.795
I'll talk to ya later.

21:13.798 --> 21:14.996
Toof.

21:18.202 --> 21:19.635
- Eyes open.
- Yeah.

21:36.720 --> 21:37.918
Toof.

21:38.388 --> 21:39.687
Stay here.

21:39.723 --> 21:40.888
Okay.

21:40.923 --> 21:42.557
Kevin, stay close to me.

22:23.365 --> 22:25.198
Who the hell are you?

22:36.110 --> 22:37.209
Okay, Leon.

22:37.244 --> 22:38.778
That's enough.

22:38.813 --> 22:40.245
Tie him up.

22:41.635 --> 22:43.215
Put the bag in the closet.

22:55.629 --> 22:57.462
He's a full patch biker.

22:57.965 --> 23:00.565
Ah, shut up, Kevin.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.800
They'll kill us!

23:02.469 --> 23:03.668
They won't.

23:04.805 --> 23:06.638
He works for us now.

23:16.941 --> 23:18.174
Kevin.

23:18.543 --> 23:19.743
Get the door.

23:20.779 --> 23:22.011
Trust me.

23:41.899 --> 23:43.098
Peter Crowchild.

23:44.568 --> 23:45.534
I called your reservation.

23:45.569 --> 23:46.735
I talked to your uncle,

23:46.771 --> 23:48.771
Chief Northwind.

23:48.806 --> 23:50.238
He vouched for you.

23:53.710 --> 23:55.844
Bikers are your problem, not mine.

23:55.879 --> 23:57.345
Like I told you,

23:57.380 --> 23:59.214
you don't have to worry about them.

24:02.385 --> 24:03.584
Leon.

24:49.264 --> 24:50.464
Hm.

24:50.833 --> 24:53.058
It's about eighty percent purity.

24:53.469 --> 24:55.301
Good doing business with you.

25:11.452 --> 25:12.852
This is crazy.

25:13.788 --> 25:14.787
Ray knows what he's doing.

25:14.822 --> 25:15.988
I'm not saying he doesn't

25:16.023 --> 25:17.823
but I didn't know we were going
to be ripping off bikers!

25:17.859 --> 25:19.024
Just think about how much dough

25:19.059 --> 25:20.025
we're going to have, Kev.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.494
Like, starting tomorrow.

25:22.630 --> 25:24.463
What you boys talking about?

25:27.735 --> 25:28.967
The future.

25:40.814 --> 25:42.814
Take him to the shed and hang him up.

25:43.317 --> 25:44.516
Okay.

25:44.651 --> 25:45.617
Let's go, boys.

25:45.652 --> 25:47.052
Get the wheelbarrow.

25:55.361 --> 25:56.561
Amazing.

25:57.564 --> 25:58.763
Thanks.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.929
John, if you're going to ask if I'm-

26:05.954 --> 26:07.187
I'm not.

26:10.509 --> 26:11.708
I'm not.

26:14.613 --> 26:17.548
I booked an appointment with Dr. Bell

26:17.583 --> 26:19.102
after I get back.

26:33.365 --> 26:34.498
Hey.

26:34.533 --> 26:35.499
Yeah?

26:35.534 --> 26:37.568
No sign of Dave's boat.

26:37.603 --> 26:39.902
We checked every dock and
boathouse on Trout Lake.

26:39.938 --> 26:41.537
Let me see if I can get the bird up,

26:41.573 --> 26:42.772
do a fly over.

26:43.208 --> 26:45.041
Yeah. I appreciate the help.

26:45.910 --> 26:47.910
So how's it going in here?

26:50.415 --> 26:52.048
Rachel is losing focus.

26:53.551 --> 26:55.150
Yeah, saw that coming.

26:56.554 --> 26:58.554
Thought these kids weren't your thing.

27:25.116 --> 27:28.783
Mmm, everybody enjoy their dinner?

27:28.819 --> 27:29.784
Yeah, it was amazing, man.

27:29.820 --> 27:32.153
You could be on, like, Iron Chef.

27:35.592 --> 27:37.125
So-

27:37.160 --> 27:38.760
Bet you boys want to know the plan, huh?

27:38.795 --> 27:40.194
- Hell, yeah!
- Okay.

27:45.601 --> 27:46.967
First off,

27:47.003 --> 27:48.836
Leon pass this around,

27:48.871 --> 27:50.804
stop using your old phones. Okay?

27:50.840 --> 27:53.071
Just use these burner
phones that I got you.

27:54.610 --> 27:58.012
Most of our product will be
reinvested into expansion.

27:58.048 --> 27:59.280
Think of it as seed money

27:59.315 --> 28:01.148
to grow our sales territory.

28:04.354 --> 28:05.352
You know, I like to say

28:05.388 --> 28:07.387
that there are three kinds of people.

28:08.624 --> 28:10.024
Those who see.

28:11.360 --> 28:13.360
Those who see when they are shown,

28:15.297 --> 28:17.130
and those who do not see.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.366
Machiavelli.

28:23.589 --> 28:25.738
I-I was, uh, an Arts major before.

28:31.012 --> 28:32.812
Woo-ooh.

28:38.653 --> 28:41.688
So, all you boys are gonna
need some cash up front, right?

28:41.723 --> 28:43.723
So each one of you will
be given a small portion

28:43.758 --> 28:45.491
of our product to sell

28:45.526 --> 28:47.159
just for yourselves.

28:47.195 --> 28:48.895
Whatever profits you make

28:48.930 --> 28:50.696
is yours to keep. Good deal?

28:50.731 --> 28:51.697
Yeah.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.566
Yeah, it sounds awesome, man.

28:53.880 --> 28:56.348
You'll never have to
worry about money again.

28:56.537 --> 28:59.179
As long as you follow my three rules.

29:00.274 --> 29:01.507
Number one:

29:02.876 --> 29:05.685
keep your mouth shut about our plans.

29:06.214 --> 29:07.412
Number two:

29:08.082 --> 29:09.514
Never lose control.

29:10.823 --> 29:12.255
And number three:

29:12.280 --> 29:13.846
No one at this table

29:13.871 --> 29:15.987
uses our product.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.288
Ever.

29:20.126 --> 29:21.759
Break any of my rules

29:24.097 --> 29:25.496
and I kill you.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.871
So-

29:36.275 --> 29:38.108
Who's ready for dessert?

29:41.713 --> 29:44.047
I am.

29:44.082 --> 29:46.516
Yeah. Let's make some money.

30:00.598 --> 30:02.698
Pretty quiet during dinner.

30:02.733 --> 30:03.699
You okay?

30:03.734 --> 30:04.733
Yeah.

30:04.935 --> 30:06.135
Yeah.

30:06.671 --> 30:08.604
Ray's something else, huh?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.972
Told you I'd hook you up.

30:14.664 --> 30:15.863
Hey, Leon, uh-

30:17.921 --> 30:19.754
Isn't Ray worried about the bikers?

30:21.752 --> 30:24.720
Ray doesn't worry.

30:24.755 --> 30:26.588
Okay, yeah, I-I know, but-

30:27.424 --> 30:29.224
It seems like the wrong
guys to be messing with.

30:29.259 --> 30:30.392
I mean, if they catch us dealing-

30:30.427 --> 30:31.626
Okay, look.

30:32.348 --> 30:34.882
Ray is protected.

30:34.952 --> 30:36.384
So we are, too.

30:37.173 --> 30:40.074
And I know that you don't
believe all the spirit stuff.

30:40.489 --> 30:42.599
But I swear to God,

30:42.624 --> 30:44.868
he knows things,

30:45.041 --> 30:47.370
things that he can't.

30:48.378 --> 30:51.145
It's gonna be all good, Kev.

30:51.181 --> 30:53.181
I wouldn't have brought
you guys in otherwise.

30:58.487 --> 30:59.687
We cool?

31:01.791 --> 31:02.990
Yeah, man.

31:04.059 --> 31:05.224
We're cool.

31:05.249 --> 31:06.448
Good.

31:11.066 --> 31:13.066
How long do you think you'll be here?

31:15.003 --> 31:16.837
I don't have anywhere to go.

31:18.026 --> 31:20.445
Least you got a hot guy checking on you.

31:22.511 --> 31:24.010
Code Blue. Second Floor.

31:24.046 --> 31:27.714
Room 237. Bed Two. Code Blue.

31:45.731 --> 31:47.031
I'll come visit you soon,

31:47.066 --> 31:48.465
but it might be on the weekend.

31:49.669 --> 31:51.969
Yeah, I'll bring you some real food.

31:52.004 --> 31:55.072
Yeah, you must be getting
tired of that hospital crap.

31:55.107 --> 31:56.306
Okay. Love you.

31:56.608 --> 31:59.025
So I hear that you're not
losing your partner after all.

31:59.945 --> 32:01.244
NIS.

32:01.280 --> 32:02.679
Delorme didn't get it.

32:05.084 --> 32:07.917
I don't know who she
pissed off at the RCMP.

32:12.458 --> 32:13.590
Delorme,

32:13.625 --> 32:16.459
OPD busted a Raiders
pick-up point last night.

32:16.494 --> 32:17.994
House was rented online.

32:18.029 --> 32:19.596
Clegg says that a few months back

32:19.631 --> 32:20.597
they busted another house

32:20.632 --> 32:22.298
that was rented through the same site.

32:22.333 --> 32:23.532
Same renter?

32:24.335 --> 32:25.534
You tell me.

32:49.893 --> 32:51.126
Time.

32:52.395 --> 32:53.629
Hey.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.867
Are ya up for a round?

32:58.902 --> 33:00.736
I'll go easy on you.

33:01.371 --> 33:03.771
I don't want you to go easy.

33:03.806 --> 33:05.640
Okay. Let's get out of here.

33:09.379 --> 33:10.345
My mom.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.779
I gotta go.

33:11.814 --> 33:13.014
- Now?
- Sorry.

33:14.651 --> 33:15.617
Maybe your battery died.

33:15.652 --> 33:16.851
Maybe she never got her text.

33:16.886 --> 33:18.319
That would only make things worse.

33:18.355 --> 33:19.754
I'll call you tonight.

33:20.923 --> 33:22.156
Yeah.

33:42.844 --> 33:44.044
Hey!

33:45.507 --> 33:46.739
Are you okay?

33:49.385 --> 33:50.584
Yeah.

33:52.253 --> 33:53.452
Ah, I couldn't-

33:54.022 --> 33:55.421
I couldn't sleep.

33:57.071 --> 33:58.704
Are you getting your memory back?

33:59.728 --> 34:00.927
No.

34:08.036 --> 34:09.235
Hey.

34:09.937 --> 34:11.136
It's me again, uh,

34:12.739 --> 34:15.536
just was thinking about you

34:16.244 --> 34:17.443
about how we-

34:19.080 --> 34:21.080
we both said some
things that we didn't mean.

34:24.219 --> 34:26.797
I don't want things to be bad between us.

34:27.487 --> 34:28.721
So just-

34:30.217 --> 34:31.616
call me back.

34:39.900 --> 34:41.299
Great. Thank you.

34:42.469 --> 34:45.036
Both the Raiders' houses
had fake renters.

34:45.071 --> 34:46.304
But the fakes

34:46.340 --> 34:48.072
used the same online payment system,

34:48.108 --> 34:49.873
linked to the same credit card.

34:49.909 --> 34:51.909
That account rent any other properties?

34:52.746 --> 34:53.878
Different house,

34:53.913 --> 34:54.879
same account.

34:54.914 --> 34:56.313
On the lake.

34:57.183 --> 34:58.616
Worth a shot.

35:57.542 --> 35:58.741
Shit.

36:53.125 --> 36:54.958
Whose blood was on that floor?

36:59.531 --> 37:00.930
Was it Wombat's?

37:05.671 --> 37:06.770
Does somebody out there have a beef

37:06.806 --> 37:08.438
with the Northern Raiders?

37:14.746 --> 37:16.746
What were you doing in the house?

37:24.288 --> 37:26.802
Did your ex Zackary take you there?

37:30.194 --> 37:33.195
The biker you said you
left six months ago.

37:39.604 --> 37:41.437
You told me you'd been clean.

37:42.907 --> 37:44.740
Is that a lie too?

37:48.779 --> 37:51.044
I want to talk to Alan Clegg.

38:05.328 --> 38:06.728
She's Clegg's C.I.?

38:09.199 --> 38:11.132
I knew she was arrested on drug charges

38:11.167 --> 38:12.367
six months ago.

38:13.649 --> 38:15.769
I guess she avoided jail time

38:15.805 --> 38:18.112
by agreeing to inform on the Raiders.

38:20.010 --> 38:21.642
Rock and a hard place.

38:42.865 --> 38:44.064
Go ahead, Rachel.

38:46.235 --> 38:47.967
We were supposed to check on Wombat.

38:48.003 --> 38:49.836
He wasn't answering his phone.

38:52.241 --> 38:53.440
Lasalle.

38:55.377 --> 38:57.177
Wombat was supposed to get
his shipment yesterday.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.645
When we got there, the place was empty.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.988
No cash. No drugs.

39:01.850 --> 39:03.716
Lasalle thinks Wombat ripped him off?

39:03.752 --> 39:04.717
No.

39:04.753 --> 39:07.420
They came up together.
They're like brothers.

39:07.455 --> 39:09.255
So if Lasalle thinks it's Wombat's blood.

39:09.290 --> 39:10.924
Who does he blame?

39:10.959 --> 39:12.191
He didn't tell us.

39:12.894 --> 39:14.827
Somebody moving in on the Raiders?

39:14.863 --> 39:16.228
A rival club?

39:16.264 --> 39:17.463
I don't know.

39:18.433 --> 39:20.433
But Lasalle is freaking out.

39:31.879 --> 39:33.879
You don't have to keep doing this.

39:36.884 --> 39:41.053
Clegg will charge me for the drug thing.

39:41.088 --> 39:42.287
I'll go to jail.

39:42.890 --> 39:45.023
We can get you a good lawyer.

39:45.059 --> 39:47.459
My parents would find out.

39:47.494 --> 39:50.328
Is that worse than
going back with the bikers?

39:58.305 --> 39:59.737
I want to help you.

40:00.813 --> 40:02.046
You can't.
