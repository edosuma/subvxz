17:13.154 --> 17:14.369
Okay, I messed up,

17:14.372 --> 17:16.204
but I can... I can fix this.

17:16.207 --> 17:17.373
I can be better.

17:17.375 --> 17:18.374
I don't know. Josh.

17:18.376 --> 17:19.657
I just... I don't know.

17:19.660 --> 17:21.710
How about I take Sophie

17:21.712 --> 17:23.628
for a nice day tomorrow?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.500
If you're gonna do this,
you better do it right,

17:28.502 --> 17:29.585
'cause I will be damned

17:29.587 --> 17:30.920
if I let you disappoint us again.

17:30.922 --> 17:32.888
You got it.

17:35.726 --> 17:37.643
Do you like your sandwich?

17:39.347 --> 17:40.596
I think it sucks.

17:40.598 --> 17:42.264
Right.

17:42.266 --> 17:45.267
Would you maybe want to eat
something else, like dessert?

17:45.269 --> 17:47.403
We can get dessert, like...

17:47.405 --> 17:49.188
let's get one hot fudge sundae

17:49.190 --> 17:50.856
with extra cherries, please.

17:50.858 --> 17:52.574
That's for you.

17:52.576 --> 17:55.077
Maraschino cherries
aren't even legally food.

17:55.079 --> 17:56.996
Yeah.

18:00.451 --> 18:02.368
So you like to draw.

18:04.538 --> 18:06.622
I guess.

18:06.624 --> 18:09.458
Would it be cool if I
took a little peak or...

18:09.460 --> 18:12.261
Whatever. It's stupid anyway.

18:16.467 --> 18:17.433
You did that?

18:19.387 --> 18:20.886
These are amazing.

18:20.888 --> 18:21.804
I...

18:24.225 --> 18:25.224
You...

18:25.226 --> 18:26.275
wow.

18:26.277 --> 18:28.310
Wow!

18:28.312 --> 18:29.812
I think the dragon's my favorite.

18:29.814 --> 18:32.948
I just started drawing dragons.

18:32.950 --> 18:35.150
Oh, yeah, so why don't you tell me,

18:35.152 --> 18:36.235
who's... who's this?

18:36.237 --> 18:37.619
Her name's Malizar.

18:37.621 --> 18:39.989
She shoots fire out of her snout.

18:39.991 --> 18:42.324
Hmm.

18:42.326 --> 18:45.244
I bet sometimes you
feel like shooting fire.

18:54.305 --> 18:56.305
Do you want to see some Elven Warriors?

18:56.307 --> 18:58.257
I would love to.

18:58.259 --> 18:59.174
Incredible.

19:00.978 --> 19:02.728
Even more incredible.

Hey, there they are!

19:08.519 --> 19:10.436
How was your day?

19:10.438 --> 19:12.187
It wasn't lame.

19:12.189 --> 19:13.489
Whoa!

19:13.491 --> 19:15.274
Big compliment from the Soph.

19:15.276 --> 19:16.658
[chuckles]

19:16.660 --> 19:20.195
Um, well, I should probably get going.

19:20.197 --> 19:22.114
Are you staying for dinner?

19:24.535 --> 19:26.702
I... well, it's up to Mike.

19:26.704 --> 19:28.620
Why don't you go wash up, sweetheart?

19:31.042 --> 19:33.175
Mike, I know I missed a lot:

19:33.177 --> 19:34.960
the ending of the "Blade" trilogy,

19:34.962 --> 19:37.046
the birth of our daughter.

19:37.048 --> 19:39.715
I just want to make up for lost time, man.

19:39.717 --> 19:41.467
I...

19:41.469 --> 19:44.053
will you give me one more shot?

19:44.055 --> 19:45.971
Will you be my best friend again?

19:47.892 --> 19:49.308
Sophie!

19:49.310 --> 19:50.726
Yeah?

19:50.728 --> 19:52.895
Set another place at the table.

19:52.897 --> 19:54.863
I was just about to order wings.

19:59.291 --> 20:01.124
You got everything, right, sweetie?

20:01.126 --> 20:02.842
Your laptop, your pencils, your erasers.

20:02.844 --> 20:03.960
Oh, and those boots you love.

20:03.962 --> 20:05.045
Did you remember the boots?

20:05.047 --> 20:06.263
Yes, I have everything.

20:06.265 --> 20:07.931
[chuckles]

20:07.933 --> 20:09.799
I'm really glad you
guys are friends again.

20:09.801 --> 20:11.801
It's pretty cool.

20:11.803 --> 20:13.470
College already.

20:13.472 --> 20:14.771
I can't believe it.

20:14.891 --> 20:15.873
I know.

20:15.993 --> 20:19.037
Seems like only yesterday she
was crawling out of that toilet.

20:19.157 --> 20:19.694
Yeah.
