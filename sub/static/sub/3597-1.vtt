00:50.426 --> 00:52.802
Vicky just told me about
this huge party tonight.

00:52.970 --> 00:55.388
- No way. Where?
- Dude, there's a huge party tonight.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.682
- Cool, we crash it?
- No, man, we're just going.

00:57.850 --> 01:01.144
- There's a huge party.
- I heard about this party tonight.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.646
My God, did you hear
Mike totally dumped Amanda?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.315
I just heard Mike Dexter
and Amanda Beckett broke up.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.318
Did you hear? Chris Moore
is totally naked under his gown.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.821
What? That was totally my idea.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.490
- Tell me we'll never break up.
- There's this party.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.493
If you're not going with anyone,
I'm not going with anyone...

01:17.661 --> 01:19.120
You're there, I'm there...

01:19.288 --> 01:21.164
- ...everybody's there.
- We're there.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.012
If you're not going with anyone
and if I'm not going with anyone...

01:36.180 --> 01:38.347
I've had a library book out
since the 3rd grade.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.683
I got caught.
I'm going to community college.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.853
- My gown smells like blue cheese.
- Shut up.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.481
- Whose party is it?
- That girl from our French class.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.150
- That girl in our gym class.
- The one with the thighs?

01:49.318 --> 01:51.694
- The one with the weird knees.
- You joined the Army?

01:51.862 --> 01:54.322
- Serve my country.
- You know they shave your head?

01:54.490 --> 01:55.531
What?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.408
I just saw Chris Moore ass-naked.

01:57.576 --> 02:00.077
- I feel so sorry for Amanda.
- You are so full of crap.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.955
If you're not going with anyone
and if I'm not going with--

02:03.123 --> 02:04.499
- No.
- Okay.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.668
Hey, dude, did you hear?
I'm naked under my gown.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.378
Yeah, I heard that.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.215
How about that party?
It's gonna be huge.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.674
I heard that too.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.552
Then I guess you heard
about Mike dumping Amanda?

02:16.720 --> 02:19.096
- Wait, what'd you say?
- Where have you been, man?

02:19.264 --> 02:22.975
Mike Dexter broke up
with Amanda Beckett.

02:43.997 --> 02:47.708
This is so perfect.
Amanda Beckett is single.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.335
And on the night of this party.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.255
A party I'll be attending,
a party she'll be attending.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.550
It's all falling into place. It's like--
It's like it's fate.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.802
I thought we weren't even going
to this party.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.264
Don't you wanna keep your tassel?
For $5 you can keep your tassel.

03:01.807 --> 03:06.394
Yeah, then I can press it in between
my yearbook with my prom corsage.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.113
- What?
- Nothing.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.866
I mean, nice to tell me
that you've changed your plans.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.285
You're only leaving tomorrow
but, whatever.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.622
Denise, Amanda and I have to finish
what we started four years ago.

03:26.790 --> 03:30.001
You know what the problem is?
It's like you're afraid to move forward.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.128
I mean, Preston,
we are so out of here.

03:32.296 --> 03:35.298
Why do you wanna go to this party
and look back? Don't look back.

03:35.465 --> 03:38.301
- You should never look back.
- Dudes, I actually graduated.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.763
- Unless you're that guy.
- Freak.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.140
I'm all right.

03:44.308 --> 03:48.227
Look, all I'm saying is,
Amanda and I are connected.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.022
We have been ever since
the first day she came to school.

03:51.189 --> 03:54.984
- Oh, God, here we go.
- It was October, freshman year.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.487
First time in history
that I'd ever missed the bus.

04:06.997 --> 04:10.750
If I had arrived on time,
I never would have seen her.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.506
But as it was, I was the first person
at Huntington Hills High...

04:17.674 --> 04:20.509
...to set eyes on Amanda Beckett.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.015
It was her first day of school.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.809
Then, I'm sitting in class...

04:28.977 --> 04:32.355
...enjoying a light breakfast
when suddenly...

04:32.522 --> 04:36.734
...out of all the classrooms in
the entire school, she walks into mine.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.445
And where does the teacher sit her?

04:39.988 --> 04:42.031
Right next to me.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.912
Now, up until now,
one could write this off to coincidence.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.664
But then...

04:50.916 --> 04:56.128
...she reached into her bag
and pulled out a strawberry Pop-Tart.

04:56.296 --> 05:00.591
The very same breakfast pastry
that I was consuming at that moment.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.260
What was I to do?
How was I to proceed?

05:03.428 --> 05:07.223
Who would like to volunteer
to give Amanda a tour of the school?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.725
I will.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.352
Mike Dexter.

05:24.199 --> 05:26.742
That's where I lost her.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.996
I had a clear shot and I hesitated.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.958
But fate's finally given me
a second chance.

05:34.376 --> 05:39.547
Well, have fun tonight and be sure to
tell everyone how much I'll miss them.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.049
You're not gonna go?

05:42.676 --> 05:45.970
- I can't believe you're not gonna go.
- Why would I go?

05:46.179 --> 05:48.347
What else are you gonna do tonight?

05:50.600 --> 05:55.062
- I can't believe I'm going to this party.
- I can't believe he broke up with her.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.695
I can't believe
you broke up with her, man.

06:04.156 --> 06:07.575
Well, it's like I always say:

06:21.923 --> 06:24.967
- But Amanda's so hot, man.
- So hot, man.

06:25.135 --> 06:28.304
Yeah, I guess. For a high-school girl.

06:28.805 --> 06:33.559
Guys, we're gonna be in college soon.
You know who's gonna be in college?

06:35.604 --> 06:38.314
- Girls that used to be in high school.
- No, man.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.901
Women, college women.

06:42.069 --> 06:46.489
Women with no curfew,
women on the pill, and women...

06:46.656 --> 06:49.408
Women, bro.
We're staring into the future here.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.744
And the future...

06:51.912 --> 06:52.953
...is women.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.124
- Women.
- Women.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.837
Hey.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.257
Maybe we should break up
with our girlfriends too.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.678
That would be sweet. We'd have the
whole summer to hang out together.

07:09.846 --> 07:12.765
Party, and get with
every chick in sight, man.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.850
Without our lame-ass
girlfriends around.

07:15.310 --> 07:18.187
- Yeah, man. They suck. They suck.
- That's what I'm saying.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.440
- That's what I'm saying.
- You're right, Dex, man.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.652
Beth can kiss my ass.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.779
- Yes, baby, yes!
- Yeah!

07:28.031 --> 07:31.325
This is brilliant, man.
This is such a good idea.

07:31.493 --> 07:35.329
- Mike Dexter's a god.
- Mike Dexter's a role model.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.334
Mike Dexter is an asshole.

07:52.556 --> 07:56.392
For the past decade,
he has made a hobby of my pain.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.312
Witness Exhibit A:
My 8th grade science project.

08:00.480 --> 08:05.067
A working rainforest that Mike
threw out a third-floor window.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.194
It rains here no more.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.572
Witness Exhibit B:

08:09.739 --> 08:12.366
An eye patch I wore for a month...

08:12.534 --> 08:15.703
...after Mike beaned me with a raisin
in Home Ec.

08:15.871 --> 08:18.831
My parents took me
to a 3-D film festival.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.708
I saw no third dimension.

08:20.876 --> 08:24.670
And of course, how can I forget
the pudding incident?

08:24.838 --> 08:26.255
I know no one else has.

08:26.423 --> 08:30.426
Well, gentlemen, tonight
Mike Dexter will know humiliation.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.054
Tonight, Mike Dexter
will know ridicule.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.558
Tonight is the night we fight back.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.436
Tonight is our independence night.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.734
Hello? Get this off your head.
You're acting like a...

08:46.902 --> 08:49.612
Look, maybe we should
go over the plan again.

08:50.363 --> 08:55.367
All right, we will set up
behind the poolhouse. Right there.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.911
This is me.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.164
You are Grand Moff Tarkin
and you are Boba Fett.

09:00.332 --> 09:03.584
- How come he gets to be Boba Fett?
- Really, it doesn't matter.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.045
Fine, you're Boba Fett,
you're Grand Moff Tarkin.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.047
I don't wanna be Grand Moff Tarkin.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.382
You know what?
Fine, you're both Kiss dolls.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.134
You set up here.

09:12.302 --> 09:16.013
Now, I will lead Mike and
one of his random jock friends...

09:16.181 --> 09:20.893
...behind the poolhouse to here and
here, where you two will be waiting.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.978
You then jump down on them...

09:23.146 --> 09:26.774
...rendering them unconscious with
the chloroform we mixed in Chem Lab.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.151
Then we strip off
said jock's clothes...

09:29.319 --> 09:34.198
...and take Polaroids of them
in a lurid, naked embrace.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.076
Do you think there'll be
any girls there?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.536
Are you kidding? People
may even be having sex.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.996
Cool.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.504
Yo, I gotta have sex tonight.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.473
I mean, peep this. It say here
92 percent of honeys at UCLA...

09:59.641 --> 10:03.185
...are sexually active. Ninety-two
percent of women in L.A. at UCLA...

10:03.353 --> 10:07.690
...are walking around going,
"Class or sex? What shall I do?"

10:07.857 --> 10:11.110
Ninety-two percent, yo.
You know what that means, don't you?

10:11.486 --> 10:14.238
That means I got a 92-percent chance
of embarrassing myself.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.615
I roll up on that shorty like,
"What's up, yo?"

10:16.783 --> 10:19.910
She be like, "You don't know 20 ways
to make me call you Big Poppa."

10:20.078 --> 10:23.831
- Because I don't, yo.
- Rest in peace.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.001
Hey, what's up, man?

10:27.168 --> 10:29.420
- Who'll be the lucky honey?
- I ain't decided yet.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.464
I figure, all the bitches in the class
gonna be at this party.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.426
I gots to give them all
an equal opportunity to Special K.

10:35.593 --> 10:40.514
It took me all day but I narrowed it
down to a list of 10 very lucky finalists.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.391
- Well, what's up, man?
- You wanna see?

10:42.559 --> 10:43.892
- Yeah.
- Check this out.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.811
Observe.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.231
The love kit.

10:51.234 --> 10:54.111
- Damn, man. Our boy is a fag, yo.
- Who's a fag?

10:54.279 --> 10:55.863
Yo, both of y'all.

10:56.031 --> 11:00.409
That is a "fragrance of love"
scented candle, bitch. Damn.

11:00.577 --> 11:03.579
You think you're gonna hit this party
packing a pleasure chest...

11:03.747 --> 11:07.499
- ...and some girl just gonna give it up?
- Watch me, G.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.760
- Wait.
- What?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.845
I have the letter.

11:20.972 --> 11:25.059
- You're not gonna give her the letter.
- Why wouldn't I give her the letter?

11:25.393 --> 11:28.812
Because you haven't had the chance
to revise it for the 4 billionth time.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.106
All great writers revise. What--?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.941
"Dear Amanda:

11:33.109 --> 11:37.696
Now that you're finally single, I can
finally give you this sappy love letter...

11:37.864 --> 11:42.701
...that I never had the guts to give you
during all four years of high school."

11:42.952 --> 11:45.746
- Listen to this.
- What?

11:45.997 --> 11:49.458
- This is Barry Manilow.
- Yeah, I know.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.753
Why do we have a radio station on
that plays Barry Manilow?

11:52.921 --> 11:55.964
Just listen to the words, Denise.

11:56.800 --> 12:01.303
Amanda. Mandy, Aman--
"Mandy" is short for Amanda.

12:01.471 --> 12:03.389
That's it, that's my sign.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.723
Preston...

12:04.891 --> 12:09.311
...I hate to interrupt this alternate
universe you've wandered into here...

12:09.479 --> 12:11.980
...but, like, I heard that song's
about his dog.

12:12.148 --> 12:16.318
It's not about a dog.
It's about a woman named Amanda.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.904
Who the hell names their dog
Amanda?

12:19.072 --> 12:21.073
My cousin named her dog
Samantha.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.284
Look, shut up about the dog, okay?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.788
That's my sign.

12:28.415 --> 12:31.083
That is totally my sign.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.751
Consider me ready.

12:33.628 --> 12:36.380
Hi. Oh, my God, you guys, come on in.
Don't let the dog out.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.299
Susan, you look so cute.
The drinks are in the back, okay?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.593
Oh, Preston, I'm so glad you came.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.555
And you brought a friend. Hi.

12:44.722 --> 12:49.017
No, it's okay. Just come on in.
Just, you know, drink and be happy.

12:49.185 --> 12:53.105
Preston Meyers, not one step further
until you sign my yearbook.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.942
I'm gonna be the first Huntington Hills
student to get all 522 seniors to sign.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.318
My, how ambitious of you.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.863
Don't think you're
getting away without signing.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.449
I saved a special space for you
to sign in the back.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.701
Why didn't you get
your senior portrait taken?

13:05.869 --> 13:08.996
Specifically to avoid
moments like this one, actually.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.166
Thanks, you two. Go, Huntington!

13:21.092 --> 13:24.595
Hey, guys, wait up.
I almost fell out of my dress.

13:25.180 --> 13:29.558
- Let's go, boys. Time is honey.
- Oh, yeah.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.019
Cool, a key party, bro.
We don't drive home drunk.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.980
You look so pretty. Christie, Jessica,
thank you for coming.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.649
- Kenny. Come on in.
- What's up?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.693
Hi. Wait, you guys.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.570
No one can go
in the fancy room, okay?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.156
Seriously, my parents
are coming home on Sunday.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.201
- Kenny Fisher, sign my yearbook.
- No thanks. No time.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.621
Come on. Where's your school spirit?
Go, Hot Dogs!

13:50.788 --> 13:53.373
- Bitch, get a life.
- Oh, yeah.

13:53.541 --> 13:55.542
We got mad talent up in this mother.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.087
Yo. Shorties gonna be lining up
to get with me.

13:59.255 --> 14:02.591
Yo, check it. Time to get busy.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.885
You think he's gonna
hizzit the skizzins?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.513
Yo, man,
that boy ain't got no skills, man.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.890
Watch out, guys. All right?
Coming through here.

14:10.058 --> 14:13.227
Yo, white boy.
You'd better check yourself, man.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.606
This is our first show ever.
Don't screw it up.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.319
Look, dude, I heard Carol Brauner
invited her cousin tonight.

14:22.487 --> 14:28.408
The word is, his brother's roommate
knows a guy who knows a scout in L.A.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.618
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.995
Thank God we got
these T-shirts printed, huh?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.997
Check them out.

14:40.463 --> 14:45.092
Okay, we are gonna rendezvous here
at 0030 hours, all right?

14:45.969 --> 14:48.220
Wait, William, there's gonna be
drinking in there.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.348
- Yeah, so?
- Well, so, what are you gonna do?

14:51.516 --> 14:54.393
They're gonna kick you out
if you don't drink.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.978
Well, I will be drinking.

14:57.021 --> 15:01.066
- But, William, you could get drunk.
- You could get addicted.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.651
No, no, no. It's okay, look.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.153
I downloaded this little baby
off the Net.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.407
I will know exactly how many spirits
I may imbibe...

15:08.575 --> 15:11.827
...without affecting my judgment
or my behavior.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.913
Wow, you've got
every angle covered.

15:15.081 --> 15:18.500
You know, William, from this light...

15:18.668 --> 15:20.502
...you somewhat resemble
David Duchovny.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.094
William, trust no one.

15:30.305 --> 15:35.767
"I am a sex machine."

15:36.519 --> 15:41.189
- "Sex machine."
- Steve, make him say something else.

15:41.608 --> 15:46.778
Okay, okay.
"Would you like to touch my penis?"

15:46.946 --> 15:50.824
"Would you like to touch my--?"

15:51.576 --> 15:55.370
Huntington Hills High, kiss my ass!

15:55.538 --> 15:57.205
Mike, you have to sign my yearbook.

15:57.373 --> 16:01.293
Which team has the winning play?
Huntington, Huntington, hey, hey, hey

16:04.756 --> 16:05.797
There they are.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.718
Come on.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.470
I missed you so much.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.390
Hi. I haven't seen my boyfriend
in six hours.

16:15.767 --> 16:16.808
How you doing, girls?

16:18.645 --> 16:22.105
Dudes, remember the game plan.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.650
What game plan?

16:26.486 --> 16:27.736
Right, exactly.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.823
Look, Beth, we need to talk.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.410
In fact, we all need to talk.
Right, guys?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.329
Oh, my God.
I can't believe she came.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.041
Guys?

16:42.085 --> 16:44.920
Hey, you guys. There's Amanda.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.095
There she is.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.042
I think you made
a real connection there.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.381
Oh, hey, guys.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.174
- Hi.
- How are you?

17:31.342 --> 17:32.592
Are you okay?

17:34.137 --> 17:35.554
Mike.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.479
- And now look what you've done.
- Maybe we should go talk to her.

17:44.647 --> 17:48.483
- Totally. She looks destroyed.
- Suicidal.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.154
All right.

18:00.580 --> 18:04.207
Looks like someone's
auditioning for Soul Train.

18:08.838 --> 18:11.006
- Do you have to rag on everybody?
- Oh, come on.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.842
His wardrobe alone
leaves him open for public mockery.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.678
I'm not the one that used to
spend the night at his house.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.223
That was 4th grade. Wanna talk
about your friends in the 4th grade?

18:20.391 --> 18:24.603
- Did you see her? Where'd she go?
- She's right there.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.024
- God.
- What? She didn't see me.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.860
- I can't believe you pointed at her.
- She didn't see me.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.529
- Are you hyperventilating?
- No, I'm centering myself.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.032
- I'm harnessing my chi.
- What?

18:37.200 --> 18:40.076
I'm harnessing my chi.
Don't laugh at me.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.703
Were you weird
when we went out?

18:41.871 --> 18:44.372
Were you bitchy when we went out?
I'm trying to think.

18:44.540 --> 18:48.543
Yeah, I was a bitchy 8th grader
for that whole week, actually.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.711
- What's up?
- Hey.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.632
I'm gonna do this.
I'm gonna go do it right now.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.136
Are you gonna be okay?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.388
Yeah, I'll get a ride home
from somebody else.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.599
- You sure?
- Yeah.

19:02.934 --> 19:06.269
- Okay.
- Go.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.741
Seriously, guys. I'm over it. Really.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.244
What?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.538
Nothing. Sorry.

19:24.705 --> 19:29.251
It's just, well, he is
the most dope guy in school.

19:29.418 --> 19:32.212
Yeah, and school's over.

19:37.093 --> 19:40.846
Anyway, I mean,
who does he think he is? Brad Pitt?

19:41.013 --> 19:42.931
Seriously, and you're like Gwyneth.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.559
Seriously, you know
he regrets breaking up with her.

19:45.726 --> 19:48.186
That's really sweet,
but I think I'm gonna--

19:48.354 --> 19:53.608
- No, we mean it. You are so Gwyneth.
- Totally Gwyneth, but prettier.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.152
Totally prettier,
but with bigger boobs.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.321
- Totally bigger boobs.
- Way bigger.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.575
You know what? I think I'm gonna
go outside and get some fresh air.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.369
But he's no Brad.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.288
He's not even Brad
in Twelve Monkeys...

20:06.455 --> 20:08.790
...when he had that weird eye
and he was all dirty.

20:08.958 --> 20:12.586
Mike Dexter doesn't even deserve
to breathe the same air as Brad.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.214
- No, he doesn't.
- Mike Dexter is an asshole.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.050
- An asshole!
- Asshole!

20:19.218 --> 20:21.678
- Asshole.
- Asshole.

20:21.846 --> 20:25.473
You know what?
I don't really wanna talk about this.

20:29.520 --> 20:32.856
Okay, I don't think
she's prettier than Gwyneth.

20:33.024 --> 20:34.441
Not even.

20:40.573 --> 20:46.328
All right, this is it. it is finally time
for Kenny Fisher to become the man.

20:46.495 --> 20:51.124
I've done my laps, and all 10 finalists
are present and accounted for.

20:51.292 --> 20:55.003
Ten lovely ladies, yo.
Each one at my disposal.

20:55.171 --> 21:00.467
Ten willing-and-able tour guides
into the theme park of love.

21:00.635 --> 21:06.264
But who will it be? Which of you
gorgeous 10 will be the lucky one?

21:06.432 --> 21:09.392
Hey, yo. Corinne, baby, what's up?

21:14.774 --> 21:19.444
Nine. Which of you gorgeous nine
will be the lucky one?

21:20.821 --> 21:25.825
Excuse me. Sorry, my fault.
My fault, sorry.

21:26.535 --> 21:32.207
Excuse me. Is this the beer?

21:32.375 --> 21:34.417
What the hell does it look like,
ass-wipe?

21:34.585 --> 21:37.587
Yeah. Sorry.

21:39.048 --> 21:43.009
- Do you want one?
- Yes, of course.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.897
It's terrible! Nobody drink the beer.

21:56.065 --> 21:58.650
The beer has gone bad.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.111
- It tastes like beer to me.
- Yeah, me too.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.113
Mine's great.

22:07.451 --> 22:11.371
- Yo, Ashley. Damn, you look beautiful.
- Thanks.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.498
Check this, I was reminiscing today,
right?

22:13.666 --> 22:15.917
I was thinking about that time
in 7th grade...

22:16.085 --> 22:19.045
...we was all playing Spin the Bottle
at Lynn's house. Remember?

22:19.213 --> 22:20.296
- I guess.
- Yeah.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.674
You and me,
we never did get that kiss, right?

22:22.842 --> 22:26.553
But I had this mad flashback
and you were staring at me all night...

22:26.721 --> 22:29.514
...kind of giggling with your girlfriends.
You remember that?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.225
Oh, I do remember that.
You were eating Cheetos.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.811
And that orange stuff
was all stuck in your braces...

22:34.979 --> 22:38.773
...and nobody wanted to tell you.
So you just kept on eating them.

22:38.941 --> 22:43.069
Oh, my, God. Lynn and I
thought that was the funniest thing.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.988
- Lynn! Come over here.
- What?

22:45.156 --> 22:50.076
Oh, my God. I'm telling little Kenny how
we used to call him Chester Cheetah.

22:51.912 --> 22:55.040
- What are you laughing at?
- Cheetah.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.755
- Bye, Chester.
- Goodbye, Chester.

23:03.883 --> 23:08.970
- Use me for my body, baby.
- Come on, baby. Give me some love.

23:09.138 --> 23:11.097
What's up, ladies?

23:11.640 --> 23:14.893
Yo, Jana, you wanna dance?

23:15.061 --> 23:16.644
I'm allergic.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.064
Allergic?

23:19.315 --> 23:22.317
- To dancing?
- Yeah.

23:46.634 --> 23:50.678
- Hey, I want you to have this.
- Oh, thank you.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.098
I heard that Mike broke up
with her a year ago...

23:53.265 --> 23:57.227
...and she's been paying him 50 bucks
a month to act like they're still together.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.021
- Pathetic.
- It's so pathetic.

24:04.652 --> 24:09.114
Yo, Preston? Preston Meyers, dude.
What's going on, man?

24:09.281 --> 24:13.451
I am so glad I got a chance to see you.
I know you're leaving tomorrow.

24:13.619 --> 24:16.704
- I'm gonna miss you, man.
- It's okay, man. Don't worry about it.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.457
I was totally remembering that time
in the 7th grade...

24:19.625 --> 24:22.210
...and when we mashed all our food
on our lunch trays...

24:22.378 --> 24:26.047
...and you paid me a dollar to eat it.
And I did. That was the best!

24:26.215 --> 24:29.551
- Yeah, good times.
- Hey, how you been?

24:30.636 --> 24:33.054
And what about that time
during softball practice...

24:33.222 --> 24:37.392
...when Ricky hit that line drive
and it hit you right in your nuts.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.271
That was the funniest, man. I mean,
I just don't know what to say about it.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.508
Okay. You remember the time
on the field trip when we went...

25:10.676 --> 25:14.429
...to the meat-packing plant and
you threw up all in your book bag?

25:14.597 --> 25:17.557
- That-- That wasn't me.
- Bull corn, remember?

25:17.725 --> 25:20.643
You tried to leave the bag on the bus
so no one would see it.

25:20.811 --> 25:24.314
Then Vice Principal Billard took it
to all the classes to see whose it was.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.442
And I was like, "Wasn't that
your bag?" And you were like, "No."

25:27.610 --> 25:30.403
And I was like, "I think it is, dude."
Then I said...

25:30.571 --> 25:32.572
- Amanda, hey.
- Hi, Ron.

25:32.740 --> 25:36.576
Hi. Are you okay?
I just heard you and Mike broke up.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.579
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.123
I just-- I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.626
I mean, you know,
after all, we're family.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.793
Second cousins.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.421
Well, you know, exactly.
We should be able to talk--

25:48.589 --> 25:50.840
"You're never gonna get
that smell out of there."

25:51.008 --> 25:52.634
- Remember?
- Hey, I got one for you.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.970
Remember that time when I was about
to talk to that beautiful girl...

25:56.138 --> 26:00.266
...and you started telling me all these
asinine stories? Remember that?

26:00.434 --> 26:02.352
- No.
- Gee, that's funny.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.771
Because it just happened!

26:05.648 --> 26:10.151
You know, I'm never gonna forget this.
See if I contact you for the reunion.

26:10.903 --> 26:15.406
Man, it's all about the memories, man.
All about the memories.

26:16.951 --> 26:21.162
Hey, who wants to go
into the hot tub with us?

26:22.665 --> 26:25.500
- Hey, yo, what's up?
- What's up? What's up?

26:25.668 --> 26:28.002
Shouldn't you be getting
your freak on by now, man?

26:28.170 --> 26:31.256
I'm just flossing while those two ho's
over there scratch it out...

26:31.423 --> 26:34.676
...over who gets to knock the boots
with me, you know what I'm saying?

26:34.843 --> 26:39.430
- What two ho's, man?
- I don't see no ho's, Kenny.

26:39.598 --> 26:42.225
- Yo, is you calling me a liar?
- Why you shoving, cracker?

26:42.393 --> 26:45.019
You'd better recognize, fool.

26:47.064 --> 26:50.358
Why y'all gotta waste my flavor?
Damn!

27:03.998 --> 27:06.749
Dude, can I talk to you for a second?

27:11.964 --> 27:15.508
- Hey. Hey, Mike, what's up, man?
- What's going on? Did you do it?

27:18.595 --> 27:22.390
- Come on.
- Mike, look, man. I don't know, man.

27:22.558 --> 27:25.852
You see, Rachel's
parents are away, right?

27:26.020 --> 27:30.898
She was kind of thinking that maybe
we can spend the night, you know?

27:31.066 --> 27:34.193
What about the game plan, man?
You promised.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.239
See, it's just that Rachel's parents...

27:38.407 --> 27:42.076
...they have mirrors above the bed.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.287
I'm gonna be like this, look.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.585
All right, all right. I get the picture.
You know what?

27:50.753 --> 27:52.920
I'm gonna go see
what the other guys are doing.

27:53.088 --> 27:57.508
- Maybe they got some balls.
- Oh, Mike. Mi--

28:35.047 --> 28:38.424
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:40.511 --> 28:43.137
Weren't you in my Language Lab?

28:43.764 --> 28:46.140
Yeah. Yeah, I was.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.477
See, I told you guys
she went to our school. Pay up.

28:52.648 --> 28:56.150
Anybody order a LoveBürger?
Well-done.

28:56.318 --> 29:00.113
- One, two-- Whoa, what is that?
- It's one of our shirts, man.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.115
I'm wearing it for publicity.

29:02.282 --> 29:04.659
You don't wear the shirt
of the band you're in.

29:04.827 --> 29:08.079
- I think it's cool. Throw me one.
- No, no. Don't throw him one.

29:08.247 --> 29:13.084
Hey, if they get to wear the shirts,
maybe I should wear the hat.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.253
You guys suck.

29:15.421 --> 29:18.089
- What the hell is that?
- A hat.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.174
- Put the music back on.
- Take off the hat.

29:20.342 --> 29:21.509
- Take off the hat.
- No.

29:21.677 --> 29:23.261
- Take if off. Take if off.
- No. No.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.346
- You want me to take it off?
- No.

29:25.514 --> 29:28.558
- Why don't you take the hat off?
- No.

29:28.851 --> 29:32.270
You come in here looking like the
white Artist Formerly Known As Prince.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.606
- Listen here, Hootie.
- "Hootie"? You look like Lestat.

29:35.774 --> 29:42.196
Oh, my God! You guys, this is why
I said no smoking in the house.

29:47.202 --> 29:49.036
Is that poop?

29:49.705 --> 29:52.623
Does someone
have poop on their shoe?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.501
Oh, my God.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.212
Does someone have poop
on their shoe on my floor?

30:05.846 --> 30:11.809
And then I heard
that he slept with some sophomore.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.146
That pig!
Well, what are you gonna do?

30:17.107 --> 30:19.066
Beat him at his own game.

30:19.234 --> 30:23.404
I am going to hook up with someone
at this party...

30:23.572 --> 30:25.615
...and hope that Jason finds out.

30:25.782 --> 30:29.076
- Wait, with who?
- Who cares?

30:29.578 --> 30:35.041
The next guy who hits on me.
No, hell, the next guy who talks to me.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.920
Wipeout.

30:41.632 --> 30:43.257
I must have died
and gone to heaven.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.843
Because I see an angel
sitting right in front of me.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.432
Are you crying?
Oh, no, baby, please.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.935
You are far too fine to look so sad.

30:55.771 --> 30:59.649
- Yeah, sure.
- Come on, don't be like that.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.026
It breaks my heart
to see you this way.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.867
You tell Special K what he can do
to make you feel better.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.624
Come to the poolhouse with me?

31:18.293 --> 31:22.630
Of course, I will.
Anything for you, baby.

31:23.840 --> 31:28.427
Could--? Could you just--?
Just wait right here one--

31:28.595 --> 31:30.680
I'll be right back, I promise.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.224
He'll do.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.102
All right, bathroom, pee,
underarm check, Breathe Asure.

31:36.270 --> 31:41.315
Yo, hold up. Do I put on the jimmy hat
now and--? No, that ain't gonna work.

31:43.986 --> 31:45.945
Damn.

31:46.780 --> 31:47.905
Damn!

31:48.407 --> 31:51.492
Yo, they're out of toilet paper.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.413
Wait, wait, Jen. Wait for us.

31:57.332 --> 32:01.961
- Oh, do you believe that?
- Oh, wait. Don't lock it.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.172
- Let's go pee in the pool.
- All right.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.681
What the hell is this?

32:16.852 --> 32:20.479
Is there another bathroom upstairs?
The line is really long. I gotta go.

32:20.647 --> 32:24.609
No one's allowed upstairs, okay?
Who did this?!

32:24.776 --> 32:26.527
I think I saw that exchange student...

32:26.695 --> 32:29.280
...walking around
with a black Magic Marker.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.657
- That little foreign dick.
- Yeah.

32:31.825 --> 32:35.369
Okay, okay, you can go upstairs.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.955
- But just you. Okay? Okay.
- All right.

32:38.123 --> 32:41.709
And don't close the door all the way,
okay, because it's sort of broken.

32:50.844 --> 32:53.387
Damn, you're the man, Kenny.

33:10.906 --> 33:11.906
Here we go.

33:24.211 --> 33:26.295
Yo, this ain't gonna--

33:27.714 --> 33:29.924
Yeah, I could do--

33:32.844 --> 33:37.223
Damn, she's gonna think I got
that premature evacuation. Damn.

33:41.645 --> 33:43.229
Damn!

33:54.866 --> 33:56.534
Dude...

33:57.703 --> 33:59.787
...these brownies suck.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.631
I don't wanna waste this.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.890
I'd better double-bag it.
I don't know where that girl been.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.648
Shut that door!

34:27.816 --> 34:29.817
- No, I mean, get out!
- Yeah, I'm trying to.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.153
- Get out!
- I can't.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.946
Move, woman!

34:36.032 --> 34:39.368
- No!
- No!

34:48.044 --> 34:50.087
Look what I got now. I got the--

34:50.255 --> 34:53.340
Look, I am telling you,
that patch of sky right over there...

34:53.508 --> 34:59.930
...above those power lines, is like
a superhighway of UFO activity.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.685
I wonder how William's doing
at the party.

35:07.981 --> 35:11.025
I hope he isn't having any trouble
blending in.

35:12.027 --> 35:14.361
Isn't there something
I was supposed to do tonight?

35:14.529 --> 35:16.405
Go, go, go!

35:24.289 --> 35:26.207
I can't feel my legs.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.959
I have no legs!

35:53.985 --> 35:56.529
Can I talk to you for a second, man?

36:04.955 --> 36:07.248
Well, did you do it, or what?

36:08.750 --> 36:11.210
Man, we will. I promise.

36:11.795 --> 36:14.755
But her dad got us all tickets
to see Pearl Jam.

36:14.923 --> 36:16.674
So we're gonna do it
after the concert.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.218
I thought Beth can kiss your ass.
Come on.

36:20.387 --> 36:24.849
Mike, sometimes we say things
we don't mean.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.768
Well, when's the concert?

36:28.103 --> 36:31.063
- August.
- August?

36:32.274 --> 36:34.400
You guys suck.

36:34.568 --> 36:39.113
- But they're really good seats.
- We're gonna deal with it eventually.

36:46.288 --> 36:49.790
If you ask me, I never really saw
you two together in the first place.

36:49.958 --> 36:53.752
Yeah. Yeah, you and me both.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.796
- What?
- Well...

36:55.964 --> 36:58.549
...I mean, I know why
I started dating him.

36:58.717 --> 37:01.302
I just don't know why
I did it for so long.

37:02.971 --> 37:07.141
It's just-- God, at first
it was all so unbelievable.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.310
I mean,
at my old junior high school...

37:09.477 --> 37:13.147
...I was always just
this little, well, nobody.

37:13.315 --> 37:15.774
And then I came to Huntington
freshman year...

37:15.942 --> 37:18.986
...and Mike Dexter
wanted to date me.

37:19.654 --> 37:23.866
And all of a sudden,
I was like Little Miss Popular.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.119
I know it sounds lame but...

37:27.287 --> 37:29.038
...it felt good.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.666
It was the first time
I'd ever felt cool in my whole life.

37:32.876 --> 37:35.711
Please, it was the first time
I'd ever had a boyfriend.

37:35.879 --> 37:39.548
I don't-- I don't understand.
I mean, what--? What happened?

37:40.216 --> 37:44.011
Nothing. Nothing.
See, that's the problem.

37:44.179 --> 37:46.972
Because Mike is the same guy now
that he was then.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.642
You know? Mooning the guy
at the drive-through window.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.019
Giving the underclassmen wedgies.

37:52.187 --> 37:54.897
Yeah, I've heard he does that.

37:55.065 --> 37:58.984
So why didn't you just,
you know, break up with him?

38:00.111 --> 38:02.029
Because I was...

38:03.615 --> 38:07.534
...scared of being alone.

38:08.370 --> 38:12.790
Mike and I went out for, like,
four years. That's, like, forever.

38:12.958 --> 38:17.044
And if I'm not Mike's girlfriend,
you know, who am I?

38:17.212 --> 38:19.922
Nobody knows me as anything else.

38:21.883 --> 38:24.718
I don't think I know me
as anything else.

38:33.103 --> 38:37.398
Look, I don't know about you...

38:38.650 --> 38:40.985
...but I really believe...

38:41.820 --> 38:46.907
...that there's one person out there
for everybody.

38:48.702 --> 38:51.078
That's what this is about.

38:52.414 --> 38:54.248
It's not just some sappy love letter...

38:54.416 --> 38:57.751
...telling her how my heart stops
every time that I see her.

38:59.754 --> 39:02.840
It's in there, but...

39:04.009 --> 39:07.970
It's not just to tell her how I think she's
more than the homecoming queen...

39:08.138 --> 39:10.305
...or Mike's girlfriend.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.892
How there's this really
amazing person inside of her...

39:14.060 --> 39:16.395
...that no one even bothers to see.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.899
It's in there too, but...

39:22.318 --> 39:24.695
What it's really about...

39:26.156 --> 39:28.824
...is how she should
just give me a chance.

39:30.118 --> 39:32.411
Just one chance.

39:34.998 --> 39:38.542
Maybe we could find out
if there's a reason for all of this.

39:39.669 --> 39:42.004
Why she's not with Mike tonight...

39:42.172 --> 39:45.549
...and after four years,
I'm still here with this letter.

39:48.136 --> 39:51.180
Maybe we could find out
what that reason is.

39:53.475 --> 39:58.479
You know? it's time to find out.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.899
I think I'm ready to do this.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.359
Finally.

40:06.321 --> 40:08.155
Any words of encouragement?

40:09.407 --> 40:12.409
Would you like to touch my penis?

40:20.502 --> 40:24.671
I am a sex machine. Sex machine.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.345
No one can hear us.

40:45.610 --> 40:48.987
- Are you satisfied?
- Woman, this is all your fault.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.949
Barging in here
like a freaking moose, all:

40:52.117 --> 40:57.579
Well, if I'd known you were gonna be in
here half-naked, pleasuring yourself...

40:57.747 --> 41:00.791
...or whatever, you know, I definitely
would have gone elsewhere.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.711
- I was getting my shit ready.
- Your "shit"?

41:04.879 --> 41:08.215
Yeah. For your information there is
a super-mad honey downstairs...

41:08.383 --> 41:12.219
...just wait--
She is dying to have sex with me.

41:12.595 --> 41:15.722
Oh, Jason, I never should have
believed those rumors.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.559
- Let's never fight again.
- Never, baby.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.477
- Hey, Carl.
- Hey, Preston. What's up?

41:20.645 --> 41:21.728
- How are you?
- All right.

41:21.896 --> 41:25.315
- Have you seen Amanda Beckett?
- Yeah, I just saw her in there.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.693
Did you hear that Mike Dexter
broke up with her?

41:27.861 --> 41:31.905
I'm thinking about asking her out, boy.
It's time to get freaky!

41:39.330 --> 41:40.581
Thanks for listening.

41:40.748 --> 41:44.376
God, I got to be prom queen and now
I want people to feel sorry for me too?

41:44.544 --> 41:46.503
- I should just shut up.
- No, no.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.506
It's okay. I mean, you know,
you need someone to listen.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.049
Thanks.

41:57.932 --> 42:01.935
Amanda, I feel
really close to you now.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.328
- What are you doing?
- I care about you.

42:19.495 --> 42:22.706
- Oh, will you get off?
- Come on. It's okay, baby.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.124
That is disgusting.

42:24.292 --> 42:26.752
Come on, you were practically
begging me for it.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.797
That is not what I was saying
and you're my cousin.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.967
- Through marriage.
- Whatever, you're sick.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.639
Shit. Oh, God. Amanda, you're not
gonna tell my parents, are you?

42:55.531 --> 42:58.116
- You see the salt on this pretzel?
- Yes.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.327
Look at the stars.

43:00.495 --> 43:04.122
Now, some people,
they say the stars...

43:04.290 --> 43:09.378
...are billions of billions
and tons of hot gas.

43:09.587 --> 43:14.841
But I think, maybe...
Maybe it's just God's salt.

43:15.843 --> 43:17.761
And God's just waiting to eat us.

43:22.433 --> 43:26.603
- Have I got some news for you.
- Really? What's that?

43:27.522 --> 43:31.275
That I recently became single.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.610
And?

43:34.279 --> 43:37.281
Well, I just remember
Jeff Gurner saying a little something...

43:37.448 --> 43:41.034
...about you girls thinking
I was the hottest senior in school.

43:41.452 --> 43:43.203
Yeah.

43:43.871 --> 43:49.835
And I remember Jeff Gurner saying
that you told him we were skanky.

43:51.337 --> 43:52.546
He told you that?

43:54.173 --> 43:56.383
Okay, see you later.

43:57.677 --> 43:59.386
Hey, isn't this the weekend...

43:59.554 --> 44:02.639
...that you're supposed to meet
your girlfriend from the Internet?

44:02.849 --> 44:08.020
Yeah, but she has some photo shoot
in Fiji for a catalog or something.

44:08.187 --> 44:11.857
- Oh, man. That sucks.
- Yeah.

44:12.025 --> 44:15.485
I guess that's just the price you pay
for dating Christy Turlington.

44:22.076 --> 44:24.911
This song goes out to Hope
from her boyfriend Ken.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.622
It's about love.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.594
I can't believe somebody threw it out.

44:40.970 --> 44:42.929
You don't throw away a yearbook!

44:43.097 --> 44:45.932
- You're supposed to cherish it forever.
- Shut up.

44:46.100 --> 44:49.436
Oh, thank God. Look at you.

44:51.481 --> 44:53.940
Trisha, sign my yearbook.

44:56.944 --> 44:59.738
- I stepped in gum.
- Come on, we're already late.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.830
Yuck.

45:09.457 --> 45:12.042
Watch out. Coming through.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.714
Cuts to the left,
decks the crap out of the wing...

45:17.882 --> 45:21.009
...and, boom, open net, scores!

45:38.027 --> 45:39.486
Does that feel good?

45:40.613 --> 45:43.365
Damn, woman. Why you gotta be
such a raging bitch?

45:43.533 --> 45:46.701
Oh, please. Listen to you.
Look, there's a mirror right there.

45:46.869 --> 45:49.496
Why don't you take a look, okay?
You're white.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.835
What's that supposed to mean?

45:56.170 --> 45:59.840
- I don't always talk like that.
- Oh, I guess you're okay, then.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.844
What about you, huh?
What about you, Miss Antisocial?

46:04.011 --> 46:06.763
Miss "I Think I'm So Much Better
Than Everybody Else."

46:06.931 --> 46:10.100
I do not think
I am better than anybody.

46:12.854 --> 46:15.897
Anyway, what do you care
what I think about you?

46:16.065 --> 46:18.608
You pretty much haven't
spoken to me since 6th grade.

46:18.776 --> 46:22.988
- Hey, you stopped speaking to me.
- Okay, whatever.

46:23.156 --> 46:25.157
Damn, you got no id--

46:25.950 --> 46:27.826
You have...

46:28.327 --> 46:30.537
...no idea what you're talking about.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.497
You don't even know me anymore.

46:33.666 --> 46:36.042
Yes, I do.
I know exactly who you are.

46:36.878 --> 46:39.588
You're Kenny Fisher,
who used to play--

46:39.922 --> 46:41.965
We used to play Miami Vice
in my basement.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.385
You used to sleep at my house,
you had to leave the hall light on.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.889
You're Kenny Fisher who used to
buy me a card every Valentine's Day.

46:49.056 --> 46:55.020
And a bag of those little hearts
with the words on them.

46:56.689 --> 46:59.399
You're Kenny Fisher who got
too cool to hang out with me...

46:59.567 --> 47:03.195
...when we hit junior high
because I was in all the smart classes.

47:03.362 --> 47:06.323
And because my parents
didn't make a lot of money...

47:06.491 --> 47:11.495
...and you desperately needed to sit
at the trendy table in the cafeteria.

47:18.127 --> 47:20.462
What the hell happened?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.673
She's not supposed to be
with somebody else.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.425
She's supposed to be with me.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.845
I mean, there was even that song
on the radio.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.515
Wasn't that a sign?

47:32.058 --> 47:35.936
Unless Denise was right.
Maybe that song was about a dog.

47:36.103 --> 47:39.648
What was I supposed to do, then?
Go out and buy a dog?

47:39.815 --> 47:43.360
No, no. it had to be a sign.

47:43.903 --> 47:46.446
It's not like you hear "Mandy"
on the radio every day.

47:46.614 --> 47:48.657
I haven't heard that song
in, like, 10 years.

47:48.824 --> 47:51.159
And since today
is Barry Manilow's birthday...

47:51.327 --> 47:55.330
...we'll be playing "Mandy" every hour
on the hour, here at Mellow 103.

47:55.498 --> 47:57.040
Thank you very, very much.

47:57.208 --> 48:00.544
And as a special treat for you,
we'll have the Manilow himself...

48:00.711 --> 48:03.046
...to answer your questions
live on the phone...

48:03.214 --> 48:05.131
...from his sold-out concert in Tokyo.

48:05.299 --> 48:08.593
So if you've got a question
for the man who writes the songs...

48:08.761 --> 48:11.304
...get to the phone and call in now.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.389
Excuse me.

49:38.726 --> 49:42.228
Are you gonna be long?
I just need to make one call.

49:45.650 --> 49:49.069
- There's two other phones.
- Yeah, they're broken.

49:49.236 --> 49:52.364
- I just put my money in.
- It's sort of an emergency.

49:52.531 --> 49:53.907
Look, it won't take long.

49:54.075 --> 49:55.992
My car broke down.
I just need to call...

49:56.160 --> 49:57.911
- Wait.
- ...a cab.

49:58.079 --> 50:01.206
- Hello? Yeah, Mellow 103?
- Mellow 103. You're on the air.

50:01.374 --> 50:05.418
Finally. Listen, I have a really important
question for Barry Manilow.

50:05.586 --> 50:10.215
In that song "Mandy," was--?
Hello? Hello?

50:14.845 --> 50:17.347
Why did you do that?

50:17.598 --> 50:19.724
Wait a second. Lady, I was--

50:22.603 --> 50:25.522
I was talking to somebody.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.612
- No. You don't just hang up.
- Hello.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.949
- Rapid Cabs.
- Hi, I need a cab, please.

50:36.117 --> 50:38.785
- I'm at Johnie's, on the boulevard.
- What are you wearing?

50:38.953 --> 50:40.912
- I'm an angel.
- I had some--

50:45.459 --> 50:47.377
Okay, I'm done now.

50:48.796 --> 50:51.881
You don't just hang up
on somebody's call like that.

50:52.049 --> 50:57.679
I think my emergency was just
a little bit larger than yours, junior.

50:58.180 --> 51:02.892
How the hell do you know?
You have no idea how long...

51:03.978 --> 51:07.230
This is great. This is just great.

51:07.398 --> 51:11.443
This is officially the worst night of
my entire life. Thank you very much.

51:11.610 --> 51:15.321
Try having 40 drunk men
grabbing your ass...

51:15.489 --> 51:17.615
...one groom-to-be
throwing up all over you...

51:17.783 --> 51:19.909
...and then have
your car break down at 2 a.m.

51:20.077 --> 51:23.830
And then you can talk to me
about having a bad night, okay?

51:26.125 --> 51:28.376
- You're a stripper?
- I'm a dancer.

51:28.544 --> 51:30.962
An angel stripper.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.715
Oh, I'm the weirdo?

51:33.883 --> 51:38.178
You're the one calling Barry Manilow
from a phone booth at 2 a.m.

51:45.519 --> 51:47.145
You're right.

51:48.939 --> 51:51.191
I'm a total loser.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.991
No, wait. I'm sorry--

52:00.159 --> 52:03.328
Great. Like I could feel any worse.

52:22.598 --> 52:26.267
That's the most disgusting thing
I've ever seen.

52:26.727 --> 52:28.394
What is wrong with you people?

52:35.319 --> 52:37.195
Hi.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.406
Do you know
who Preston Meyers is?

52:41.742 --> 52:44.410
He only sat right next to you
in Freshman English.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.371
But I guess
you wouldn't remember that.

52:46.539 --> 52:48.957
I mean, why would Amanda Beckett
pay any attention...

52:49.124 --> 52:51.292
...to a unique spirit like Preston.

52:51.460 --> 52:54.295
Or even a unique spirit like me,
for instance.

52:54.463 --> 52:57.507
Maybe it's because
she's just a little too busy...

52:57.675 --> 53:01.886
...ordering around her
little conformist flock of sheep.

53:02.054 --> 53:03.763
Sheep!

53:03.931 --> 53:08.768
You are all sheep.

53:22.199 --> 53:24.826
No!

53:25.619 --> 53:28.371
Hey, Luke doesn't push Vader.

53:28.539 --> 53:31.583
Well, he should of.
I mean, the guy cut his hand off.

53:31.876 --> 53:34.878
Those were our only flashlights.

53:35.045 --> 53:36.880
Oh, yeah.

53:38.549 --> 53:40.091
Jeez.

53:40.259 --> 53:43.928
- It's kind of dark up here.
- Yeah.

53:47.433 --> 53:49.225
You know what?

53:50.644 --> 53:53.146
This is just like that Scott Baio thing.

53:53.314 --> 53:56.900
When I was 16, I had
the biggest thing for Scott Baio.

53:57.067 --> 54:00.153
Listen, you don't have to sit here
and go through...

54:01.113 --> 54:04.532
- Scott Baio?
- I said I was 16.

54:04.700 --> 54:07.952
I mean, this went back to
the Happy Days years, you know?

54:08.120 --> 54:10.705
Not to mention
Joanie Loves Chachi.

54:10.873 --> 54:14.000
God, I hated her, Joanie.

54:14.168 --> 54:18.630
You see, I always knew
that somehow I'd meet him.

54:18.797 --> 54:22.800
You know? Like if I wanted it
bad enough, I could make it happen.

54:23.427 --> 54:24.719
And it did.

54:24.887 --> 54:27.847
Right after his first season of
Charles in Charge...

54:28.015 --> 54:32.852
...he was doing this mall tour,
and he came here to our mall.

54:33.145 --> 54:38.107
It was like everything was finally falling
into place, you know? Like it was...

54:38.275 --> 54:40.276
- Fate.
- Yeah.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.904
So I went, you know.

54:43.906 --> 54:45.448
And I had this red bandanna.

54:45.616 --> 54:49.160
Because you know how Chachi
always wore that red bandanna?

54:50.037 --> 54:52.997
And I waited there outside.

54:54.667 --> 54:58.211
And I was the first person
when he pulled up.

54:58.963 --> 55:01.130
He got out of that car--

55:03.884 --> 55:08.930
He was so beautiful.
And he looked right at me.

55:09.098 --> 55:10.431
And I didn't know what to do.

55:10.599 --> 55:13.226
I mean, I couldn't say anything,
I couldn't even move.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.896
I never even talked to him
and he was right there.

55:17.731 --> 55:20.066
I think I still have that red bandanna.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.570
But the thing is, you never know,
you know?

55:24.738 --> 55:28.074
Like, had I at least
maybe said something...

55:28.409 --> 55:30.410
...you never know.

55:30.577 --> 55:33.913
But anyway, the point is
I totally realized, you know?

55:34.081 --> 55:36.040
Fate. There is fate.

55:36.208 --> 55:37.667
But it only takes you so far...

55:37.835 --> 55:41.546
...because once you're there,
it's up to you to make it happen.

55:42.631 --> 55:46.342
- You are so definitely right.
- I know.

55:47.136 --> 55:50.805
So, look, don't you make
the same mistake I did, okay?

55:50.973 --> 55:52.932
Because if you really wanna
be with him...

55:53.100 --> 55:56.269
...then you get back on that phone
and you call Barry Manilow...

55:56.437 --> 55:58.938
...and you tell him how you feel.

55:59.314 --> 56:02.984
No. Oh, no.
I didn't want him, I was--

56:03.152 --> 56:06.195
It's okay. I don't think it's weird.

56:06.363 --> 56:09.532
I mean, come on. Scott Baio.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.452
We all have our things.

56:32.473 --> 56:34.474
You are a no-talent,
posturing little Smurf.

56:34.641 --> 56:38.936
Really? That's not what your
girlfriend said last night in your van.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.403
You guys are such amateurs, okay?

56:47.571 --> 56:50.448
I quit. All right.

56:50.616 --> 56:53.493
Way to go. Why didn't you
just take off that T-shirt?

56:53.660 --> 56:54.660
- Me?
- You.

56:54.828 --> 56:57.121
We were fine until you pulled out
that stupid hat.

56:57.289 --> 57:01.084
This hat is not stupid.
This hat is cool.

57:01.251 --> 57:04.295
- Way to go, man.
- What the hell did I do?

57:04.463 --> 57:07.924
- You suck.
- Get out of here.

57:08.717 --> 57:11.552
I'll be the band, dudes.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.814
Hey, I know this song.
I know this song.

57:22.981 --> 57:27.235
I know this song. A guy I tutored
in math used to make me listen to it.

57:34.284 --> 57:37.829
Wild Bill, rock 'n' roll!

58:36.680 --> 58:39.265
- He is so cute.
- I know.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.254
- Hey.
- Oh, my God!

59:19.473 --> 59:21.265
Bill! Sign my yearbook.

59:23.602 --> 59:25.895
Hey! Hey!

59:28.732 --> 59:30.149
You know what?

59:30.317 --> 59:34.070
My retainer kind of looks like
a Klingon warship.

59:35.030 --> 59:38.074
Fire photons.

59:48.001 --> 59:51.420
This is the greatest night
of my life.

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:07.436
Yeah! Yeah!

1:00:08.563 --> 1:00:10.982
Bill! Bill! Bill!

1:00:17.656 --> 1:00:20.032
- Get up.
- What?

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:23.035
- I gotta pee.
- You are not peeing in here.

1:00:23.203 --> 1:00:27.123
- It's a bathroom!
- Yeah, I'm aware of that by now.

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:30.293
Are you gonna move or not?
Because I'm gonna go.

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:32.044
God, you are disgusting.

1:00:45.350 --> 1:00:47.727
I cannot listen to this.

1:00:55.110 --> 1:00:58.571
So, what, were you just, like,
saving up all that stuff to tell me?

1:00:59.156 --> 1:01:02.283
Do you really wanna talk about this
while you're doing that?

1:01:03.243 --> 1:01:06.579
I mean, jeez, if it had been
on your mind the last six years...

1:01:07.414 --> 1:01:09.832
...you'd think you might have
mentioned something.

1:01:10.250 --> 1:01:13.336
When? When you were
ignoring me in the halls?

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:15.921
When you were writing
"Denise Fleming's a tampon"...

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:17.506
...on my locker freshmen year?

1:01:17.674 --> 1:01:21.719
I did not write
"Denise Fleming is a tampon."

1:01:22.012 --> 1:01:25.222
Yeah, just like you didn't destroy
my Cabbage Patch Kid in 2nd grade?

1:01:26.433 --> 1:01:29.060
Second grade?

1:01:30.354 --> 1:01:33.272
- Besides, I admitted that right away.
- No, you didn't.

1:01:33.440 --> 1:01:36.359
When I picked her up, her head
fell off and you started to cry.

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:40.863
- It kind of tipped me off.
- I did not cry...

1:01:41.573 --> 1:01:42.615
...much.

1:01:45.494 --> 1:01:48.287
Fine, I told John to write
"Denise Fleming is a tampon."

1:01:48.455 --> 1:01:51.832
I swear, I felt really bad afterwards.

1:01:57.631 --> 1:01:59.632
It's all right. I told...

1:02:00.092 --> 1:02:02.718
...Diana Yellin
that you were a dendrophiliac.

1:02:04.805 --> 1:02:06.514
What is that?

1:02:07.641 --> 1:02:10.810
It's someone who has sex with trees.

1:02:13.271 --> 1:02:14.313
That's not funny.

1:02:17.859 --> 1:02:19.985
No way. He asked me
to hold his laser pointer.

1:02:20.153 --> 1:02:22.905
Now, ladies, ladies, please.

1:02:23.073 --> 1:02:26.742
Both of you can hold
my laser pointer anytime.

1:02:26.910 --> 1:02:28.536
Come on.

1:02:33.166 --> 1:02:37.837
Did those two girls just go in the
make-out room with William Lichter?

1:02:38.004 --> 1:02:41.340
- Yeah.
- They're so lucky.

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:50.182
Hey, man. You want a beer?

1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:58.399
- Trip McNeely.
- Trip McNeely.

1:02:58.567 --> 1:02:59.942
No way, man.

1:03:00.110 --> 1:03:02.653
- Trip McNeely.
- Trip McNeely.

1:03:02.863 --> 1:03:04.780
Jeez.

1:03:04.948 --> 1:03:07.616
You were a sexual icon.

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:10.536
You know, girls at Huntington
still talk about you.

1:03:10.704 --> 1:03:12.329
Really?

1:03:13.206 --> 1:03:14.623
Which ones?

1:03:14.791 --> 1:03:17.710
You must be racking up at college.
College.

1:03:17.878 --> 1:03:20.337
I wish, bro.
I can't even get digits as a freshman.

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:23.883
Shut up. Come on, you can tell me.

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:29.054
Seriously, man. I thought college
was gonna be a 24/7 orgy.

1:03:30.557 --> 1:03:34.268
Hell, that's even why
I broke up with Janine before I left.

1:03:38.899 --> 1:03:40.649
So, what happened?

1:03:42.444 --> 1:03:45.738
College chicks
are totally different, bro.

1:03:46.406 --> 1:03:49.116
They're all serious and shit.

1:03:50.619 --> 1:03:55.164
They all talk about world issues
and economological crap.

1:03:55.582 --> 1:03:58.250
They all wanna date older guys.

1:04:00.253 --> 1:04:01.795
Yeah, but...

1:04:02.422 --> 1:04:06.091
- ...not all of them, right?
- The way it goes.

1:04:06.259 --> 1:04:09.512
Hell, I even tried
crawling back to Janine.

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:14.892
She was all cozy with some senior.
He's a premed.

1:04:15.602 --> 1:04:17.520
They all are.

1:04:18.063 --> 1:04:22.566
Guys like us,
we are a dime a dozen.

1:04:29.324 --> 1:04:33.035
Speaking of which,
are you still with that Amanda chick?

1:04:33.203 --> 1:04:35.663
She was a prize piece
if I ever saw one.

1:04:35.830 --> 1:04:40.543
Yeah. Me and Amanda. Definitely.

1:04:40.710 --> 1:04:44.046
- Yup.
- You're lucky, bro.

1:04:45.423 --> 1:04:48.259
- I sure am.
- Stay with her.

1:04:48.927 --> 1:04:51.595
It's the best advice I can give you.

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:56.934
Oh, that and bring
rubber flip-flops to the shower.

1:04:57.102 --> 1:05:00.271
I got warts all over my feet.

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:04.149
Take it easy, Trip.

1:05:04.859 --> 1:05:08.112
Trip McNeely. All right.

1:05:10.323 --> 1:05:12.199
Amanda?

1:05:20.166 --> 1:05:24.003
- Have you seen Amanda Beckett?
- No.

1:05:26.631 --> 1:05:28.882
Preston? I don't know.

1:05:29.050 --> 1:05:32.094
Well, his hair is kind of--
I don't know.

1:05:32.262 --> 1:05:35.347
- Brown.
- No, it's not really brown.

1:05:35.515 --> 1:05:37.558
- Oh, he's tall.
- Yeah.

1:05:37.726 --> 1:05:40.436
He's kind of-- Kind of tall.
Sort of tall.

1:05:40.604 --> 1:05:44.106
And he's, like,
always wearing, like, T-shirts.

1:05:44.274 --> 1:05:46.525
Yeah. Yeah.

1:05:49.279 --> 1:05:50.863
Sometimes.

1:05:51.364 --> 1:05:54.617
- So he's sort of tall.
- Kind of.

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:57.036
- With hair.
- Yeah.

1:05:57.203 --> 1:05:59.371
And he wears T-shirts sometimes.

1:05:59.539 --> 1:06:01.081
- Yeah.
- Yes.

1:06:01.249 --> 1:06:04.001
- That's it?
- Yes.

1:06:04.586 --> 1:06:08.297
Well, I mean, he's Preston.
He's Preston, you know?

1:06:08.715 --> 1:06:10.299
Preston. I like that guy.

1:06:10.467 --> 1:06:12.509
- Preston.
- Preston.

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:15.596
You know who else I like
who never got much play?

1:06:15.764 --> 1:06:21.226
Is Velma from Scooby-Doo.
She-- Right. She was also a cool--

1:06:21.394 --> 1:06:23.145
- She was a hip, hip lady.
- A hip chick.

1:06:23.313 --> 1:06:24.980
Watch it. Hey!

1:06:25.523 --> 1:06:28.150
Amanda. Amanda.

1:06:32.072 --> 1:06:33.906
Amanda.

1:06:36.743 --> 1:06:38.661
Oh, God. Mike, get off.

1:06:39.913 --> 1:06:42.331
What? Can't I hug my girl if I want?

1:06:42.499 --> 1:06:45.876
I am not your girl and
you're obviously drunk, so...

1:06:46.044 --> 1:06:48.420
No. No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1:06:50.924 --> 1:06:53.175
- We need to talk.
- About what?

1:06:53.343 --> 1:06:56.595
- Us.
- There is no "us."

1:06:56.763 --> 1:06:59.598
No, but there is, see.
Because...

1:07:01.184 --> 1:07:06.188
...I've been thinking.
Doing a lot of thinking. And I think...

1:07:10.276 --> 1:07:11.944
I think...

1:07:15.407 --> 1:07:18.075
I think we should get back together.

1:07:18.952 --> 1:07:19.952
Why?

1:07:21.079 --> 1:07:23.288
- What?
- Why?

1:07:23.456 --> 1:07:28.794
Give me one good reason why--
No, you know what? Screw that.

1:07:28.962 --> 1:07:32.589
- No, Mike. My answer is no.
- "No"?

1:07:35.468 --> 1:07:39.138
You mean you don't want me
to take you back?

1:07:40.765 --> 1:07:45.561
Because I'm-- I'm serious about this.
You should really think about this.

1:07:45.729 --> 1:07:47.312
Think about what, Mike?

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:49.648
That you're a childish,
self-centered asshole?

1:07:51.985 --> 1:07:53.277
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

1:07:54.529 --> 1:07:57.656
Mike, take me back? Please.

1:08:02.287 --> 1:08:04.788
Look, you're drunk, okay?
And we're over.

1:08:04.956 --> 1:08:08.292
So why don't you just walk away now
and save yourself the embarrassment?

1:08:10.503 --> 1:08:15.007
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well,
you're the one, "Aman-duh"...

1:08:15.175 --> 1:08:17.634
- ...who's gonna be embarrassed.
- Stop it.

1:08:17.844 --> 1:08:20.179
Who's gonna want you now?

1:08:23.349 --> 1:08:25.100
Somebody.

1:08:29.939 --> 1:08:31.857
"Somebody."

1:08:32.025 --> 1:08:35.903
More like nobody.

1:08:38.865 --> 1:08:43.285
Gosh, Mike, you really got me there.

1:08:49.584 --> 1:08:51.376
Fag!

1:09:01.137 --> 1:09:02.721
Shut up!

1:09:03.598 --> 1:09:05.140
Yes!

1:09:05.308 --> 1:09:08.811
I'll kick everyone's ass in this room!

1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:24.409
Amanda.

1:09:24.744 --> 1:09:27.162
Now that Mike is completely
out of the picture...

1:09:27.330 --> 1:09:30.833
...I was thinking maybe you'd like
to come to my van...

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:34.002
...and I could turn that frown
upside down.

1:09:34.170 --> 1:09:38.841
Amanda, hey,
I just saw what happened and I...

1:09:39.008 --> 1:09:42.845
Oh, God, you're a hottie.
Hey, can I see you naked?

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:46.682
Hey, Amanda, remember that time
you danced with me at the soph hop?

1:09:46.850 --> 1:09:49.643
I never told you, but I had
the hugest boner and I thought...

1:09:49.811 --> 1:09:52.020
- Oh, my God.
- ...maybe we could work things out.

1:09:52.188 --> 1:09:55.190
Let me get you out of that skirt, baby.
You look good.

1:09:59.779 --> 1:10:03.240
Hey, Amanda,
do you want some watermelon?

1:10:03.408 --> 1:10:04.700
Amanda.

1:10:05.535 --> 1:10:07.578
Amanda, I love you.

1:10:10.456 --> 1:10:14.751
Listen, I know that must sound really
strange, but I've always-- Excuse me.

1:10:14.919 --> 1:10:18.046
I've always felt that there was this
unspoken connection between us.

1:10:18.214 --> 1:10:22.301
Ever since the first time I saw you when
you were holding my favorite Pop-Tart.

1:10:22.468 --> 1:10:26.179
And the truth is, I'm leaving tomorrow
and if we could go someplace--

1:10:26.347 --> 1:10:28.265
Oh, you know what? That is enough.

1:10:28.433 --> 1:10:30.559
That is enough.

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:34.980
God, I haven't even been single
for, like, five minutes...

1:10:35.148 --> 1:10:39.401
...and already-- Already you think that
I am just gonna strip off my clothes...

1:10:39.569 --> 1:10:42.696
...and do you right here because--
I don't know.

1:10:42.864 --> 1:10:45.824
I don't know, you imagine that
we shared some intimate moment...

1:10:45.992 --> 1:10:49.661
...that you have probably been
drooling over for the past four years.

1:10:49.829 --> 1:10:52.956
God, you know, how sick
and deluded are you?

1:10:55.418 --> 1:10:56.501
You know what?

1:10:56.669 --> 1:11:00.756
Why don't you just go off and get
yourself a goddamn life, asshole?

1:11:04.135 --> 1:11:09.014
Thanks, man. That was
the funniest thing I've seen all night.

1:11:13.770 --> 1:11:16.980
Oh, man. I hope the guys are okay.

1:11:18.524 --> 1:11:21.193
- Don't stick that probe there!
- Daddy.

1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:29.451
Mike. Hey, buddy, hey.

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:34.539
Mike, you have to come outside
with me, man. Because we are go--

1:11:34.707 --> 1:11:36.458
There is...

1:11:37.001 --> 1:11:40.087
Oh, there's this chick out there.
There's two chicks out there.

1:11:40.254 --> 1:11:43.465
They're triplets, man. You're not
gonna believe what they're doing.

1:11:43.633 --> 1:11:48.845
Not because I made it up or anything
but because it is so unbelievable, man.

1:11:49.013 --> 1:11:50.722
Come out to the poolhouse with me.

1:11:50.890 --> 1:11:54.685
Because they told me that they want
you to-- To watch them, right?

1:11:54.852 --> 1:11:58.355
They want you to watch them, so we're
gonna-- Let's go out to the poolhouse.

1:11:58.523 --> 1:12:00.816
Come on. Come on.

1:12:01.401 --> 1:12:02.734
Come on.

1:12:03.277 --> 1:12:04.736
I'm a loser.

1:12:06.948 --> 1:12:10.659
I broke up
with the hottest girl in school.

1:12:11.619 --> 1:12:14.371
My friends all sold me out...

1:12:14.872 --> 1:12:18.417
...and someone in there
called me a fag.

1:12:18.835 --> 1:12:20.002
Why?

1:12:22.588 --> 1:12:24.214
Mike?

1:12:39.647 --> 1:12:42.274
- You loved the New Kids.
- Oh, the acid-washed jeans.

1:12:42.442 --> 1:12:44.317
Yeah, with the built-in rips.
You had--

1:12:44.485 --> 1:12:46.319
You were a fashion victim
from the womb.

1:12:46.487 --> 1:12:49.698
Thank you, thank you.
I've gotten better since then.

1:12:49.866 --> 1:12:53.452
Yeah, if you need to fit
a family of five in your pants.

1:12:53.619 --> 1:12:55.954
Shut up. These are cool.

1:12:57.165 --> 1:12:59.458
All right. But the goggles...

1:13:00.084 --> 1:13:02.461
Everybody's wearing these.

1:13:04.338 --> 1:13:05.839
All right.

1:13:06.299 --> 1:13:08.592
- Okay. Okay, my turn.
- What?

1:13:08.760 --> 1:13:10.635
- The shoes.
- What is wrong with my shoes?

1:13:10.803 --> 1:13:13.096
- Those shoes.
- What? What?

1:13:13.264 --> 1:13:16.224
Do they serve
an orthopedic function?

1:13:16.809 --> 1:13:18.852
No. Fine.

1:13:19.020 --> 1:13:21.229
- What about your shoes?
- What's wrong with them?

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:23.648
Is there a mission to the moon later?

1:13:25.735 --> 1:13:26.902
Yeah.

1:13:27.070 --> 1:13:30.489
- Your feet smell.
- Shut up, they do not.

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:07.859
I'm the king of beer.

1:14:08.027 --> 1:14:11.655
Amanda.
You still didn't sign my yearbook.

1:14:18.079 --> 1:14:21.373
Actually, I'm trying to get everyone
to sign by their own picture.

1:14:21.707 --> 1:14:23.041
Oh, my God.

1:14:24.001 --> 1:14:25.210
Oh, shit.

1:14:26.087 --> 1:14:27.879
What is wrong with everybody?

1:14:28.047 --> 1:14:30.841
These are memories
frozen in time, people!

1:15:11.424 --> 1:15:12.841
Who needs her? Who needs her?

1:15:13.009 --> 1:15:16.928
You know--? You know what they say
about women and trolley cars, right?

1:15:17.096 --> 1:15:20.432
There's plenty of them in the sea.
Am I right, or am I right?

1:15:20.600 --> 1:15:22.767
You are correct.

1:15:22.935 --> 1:15:28.190
You're 110 percent right.

1:15:30.443 --> 1:15:33.653
- Let me ask you something. Wait, no.
- What?

1:15:34.071 --> 1:15:39.451
You remember the time that you had
to make that really stupid speech...

1:15:39.619 --> 1:15:45.332
...and I kind of sort of tripped you and
everybody started laughing at you?

1:15:45.499 --> 1:15:47.792
Okay, yeah, yeah.

1:15:52.798 --> 1:15:54.799
I'm sorry.

1:15:55.051 --> 1:15:58.470
Oh, man, hey.
Don't worry about it, man. Hey.

1:15:58.638 --> 1:16:01.640
It's ancient history, right?
It's ancient history.

1:16:01.807 --> 1:16:04.100
- It's ancient history.
- To ancient history.

1:16:05.436 --> 1:16:08.813
- When was that anyway?
- That was this morning at graduation.

1:16:08.981 --> 1:16:10.148
Oh, yeah.

1:16:12.818 --> 1:16:14.986
Hey, you think I could I get a shirt?

1:16:15.821 --> 1:16:18.740
You know, for nostalgia.

1:16:19.325 --> 1:16:20.867
Here.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.578
Hey, guys, what would you think
about a reunion?

1:16:23.996 --> 1:16:29.376
Nothing big.
A few new songs, mostly old stuff.

1:16:30.711 --> 1:16:32.587
I could be into that.

1:16:34.090 --> 1:16:36.091
Sure, why not?

1:16:42.682 --> 1:16:45.558
- I love you, man.
- I love you.

1:16:46.269 --> 1:16:51.189
- How's my boys?
- What's up with my niggas, man?

1:16:58.322 --> 1:17:00.448
- Cold floor, cold floor.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:02.534
That's okay.

1:17:06.455 --> 1:17:08.915
Have you ever done this before?

1:17:09.667 --> 1:17:11.668
Yeah, yeah.

1:17:13.170 --> 1:17:15.714
No. Why, have you?

1:17:15.881 --> 1:17:19.884
Yeah. Once. It was this guy--

1:17:20.052 --> 1:17:21.886
I don't wanna know.

1:17:22.054 --> 1:17:25.515
You're right. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1:17:36.652 --> 1:17:38.403
- Are they gone?
- I think so, yeah.

1:17:38.571 --> 1:17:40.572
I think they're gone, man.

1:17:40.740 --> 1:17:43.616
But if they were still here,
I'd break them off like Kato.

1:17:43.784 --> 1:17:45.410
- Yo, po-po.
- It's the cops.

1:17:45.578 --> 1:17:47.412
Man, let's bail.

1:17:47.580 --> 1:17:50.999
- This is it. I knew we could do it.
- One, two, three--

1:17:51.167 --> 1:17:53.168
Everybody freeze!

1:17:53.336 --> 1:17:55.420
Oh, my God!

1:17:57.340 --> 1:17:58.590
Hey!

1:17:59.759 --> 1:18:01.760
The cops!

1:18:02.678 --> 1:18:03.762
No, the cops!

1:18:03.929 --> 1:18:06.306
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:18:14.106 --> 1:18:17.025
Bill. Bill, you never signed
my yearbook.

1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:18.860
Hey!

1:18:20.154 --> 1:18:23.114
Come on, we can hide
in the poolhouse, Willy.

1:18:23.366 --> 1:18:24.407
What the--?

1:18:25.242 --> 1:18:28.453
- Viva la poolhouse, right?
- Come on.

1:18:28.621 --> 1:18:31.915
The poolhouse.
The poolhouse. Mike!

1:18:41.300 --> 1:18:43.218
Back here, Billy.

1:18:46.138 --> 1:18:48.098
Mike, wait.

1:18:54.772 --> 1:18:57.732
It worked.
All right, take off their clothes.

1:19:12.415 --> 1:19:14.457
Get the Polaroid.

1:19:15.459 --> 1:19:20.004
Look at you,
Mr. "I'm a Big Football Jock."

1:19:20.214 --> 1:19:22.340
How do you like me now,
buddy, huh?

1:19:26.137 --> 1:19:28.430
Look, my flashlight.

1:19:28.848 --> 1:19:32.350
Oh, no. It's William.

1:19:38.482 --> 1:19:40.191
Oh, God. Let's get out of here.

1:20:13.392 --> 1:20:15.226
Jesus cribs.

1:20:16.312 --> 1:20:19.564
Let's load these sickos
into the wagon.

1:20:38.834 --> 1:20:40.418
Well...

1:20:40.669 --> 1:20:42.253
Well...

1:20:52.264 --> 1:20:54.098
So...

1:20:55.643 --> 1:20:57.227
You know...

1:20:59.772 --> 1:21:01.731
...it gets better.

1:21:01.982 --> 1:21:03.441
- What?
- Well...

1:21:04.568 --> 1:21:07.195
...next time, you know...

1:21:08.030 --> 1:21:10.532
...you won't be--
It can go for longer.

1:21:11.408 --> 1:21:13.368
No, that's not what I meant.
I meant--

1:21:13.536 --> 1:21:18.122
I meant that since
we'd never done it before...

1:21:18.874 --> 1:21:21.459
...together, that...

1:21:21.627 --> 1:21:23.628
Yeah? How do you know
it wasn't your fault?

1:21:24.088 --> 1:21:26.422
- I-- I--
- I mean, you said yourself...

1:21:26.590 --> 1:21:28.841
...you'd only done it, what,
like one time before.

1:21:29.009 --> 1:21:31.636
I mean, what, does that make you
some kind of expert?

1:21:33.973 --> 1:21:35.306
I never said I was an expert.

1:21:35.474 --> 1:21:38.977
I mean, because my shit could have
been slamming with somebody else.

1:21:39.311 --> 1:21:40.812
What?

1:21:42.022 --> 1:21:43.731
Look, baby.

1:21:44.525 --> 1:21:47.485
I mean, it ain't your fault
you lack the flavor.

1:21:51.198 --> 1:21:52.824
You asshole.

1:21:54.660 --> 1:21:58.288
- Who the hell is in here?
- Don't you even knock?

1:21:58.455 --> 1:22:00.707
I don't have to knock.
This is my house!

1:22:00.874 --> 1:22:03.543
Yeah, you should fix that door.

1:22:04.003 --> 1:22:06.629
- Denise.
- Don't touch me. You make me sick.

1:22:06.797 --> 1:22:08.548
- Get out!
- Denise!

1:22:08.716 --> 1:22:10.675
- Get out!
- I'm trying to.

1:22:10.843 --> 1:22:14.804
Well, let me help you. Now, get out!

1:22:14.972 --> 1:22:17.724
- What is your problem?!
- My problem?

1:22:17.891 --> 1:22:22.145
You wanna know what my problem is?
I'll tell you what my problem is!

1:22:25.357 --> 1:22:27.025
Denise.

1:22:27.693 --> 1:22:29.819
Come on. What,
are you just gonna walk home?

1:22:30.571 --> 1:22:31.696
It's not that far.

1:22:36.201 --> 1:22:39.078
Just... Just...

1:22:39.246 --> 1:22:42.874
Just stop, okay? Look,
just slow down a sec, would you?

1:22:43.042 --> 1:22:45.084
I wanna explain.

1:22:45.711 --> 1:22:48.171
- Don't bother.
- No, no. Come on, come on, just...

1:22:50.341 --> 1:22:52.925
You-- We just--

1:23:01.894 --> 1:23:04.854
Look, I'm... I'm...

1:23:07.441 --> 1:23:09.233
I'm...

1:23:09.735 --> 1:23:11.402
I'm sorry.

1:23:17.618 --> 1:23:19.243
You know?

1:23:20.871 --> 1:23:22.580
Yeah.

1:23:23.916 --> 1:23:26.250
I shouldn't have said-- You know.

1:23:28.962 --> 1:23:31.172
I'm sorry too.

1:23:42.351 --> 1:23:46.020
- So...
- So...

1:23:57.116 --> 1:23:59.033
Lichter.

1:23:59.451 --> 1:24:01.119
- William.
- What?

1:24:01.286 --> 1:24:03.329
Let's go. Time to get up.

1:24:03.497 --> 1:24:05.957
Your parents are here
to take you home.

1:24:06.125 --> 1:24:10.128
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1:24:10.295 --> 1:24:12.964
My parents. My--
Have you seen them?

1:24:13.132 --> 1:24:14.716
Are they really angry? Are they--?

1:24:14.883 --> 1:24:17.969
Have you seen my father?
Does he have a weapon? Or a--?

1:24:18.137 --> 1:24:20.430
Afraid not. Actually...

1:24:21.557 --> 1:24:24.183
...they're more worried about you
than anything else.

1:24:24.351 --> 1:24:28.479
You know,
because it's not your fault that:

1:24:28.647 --> 1:24:31.858
"Mike Dexter beat you up
and forced you to drink alcohol...

1:24:32.025 --> 1:24:34.110
- ...until you passed out."
- He--

1:24:34.278 --> 1:24:36.112
Wh--? What?

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:39.157
That's the statement we got
from the Dexter kid.

1:24:39.324 --> 1:24:41.784
He made you drink,
took your clothes off and--

1:24:41.952 --> 1:24:46.706
No, no, no. I-- It's what--
Yeah, you know.

1:24:46.874 --> 1:24:51.711
It's just funny that he finally
came clean, you know?

1:24:51.879 --> 1:24:56.174
Mike, always picking on me, yeah.

1:24:57.509 --> 1:24:59.218
Oh, God.

1:25:01.764 --> 1:25:04.515
Well, whatever.

1:25:05.642 --> 1:25:08.269
Might be a good idea
to lay off that alcohol.

1:25:08.437 --> 1:25:10.563
Your life's gonna go
right down the crapper.

1:25:10.731 --> 1:25:14.025
- Unless that's what you're going for?
- No, no, no.

1:25:14.193 --> 1:25:18.029
No, no, no. Thank you.

1:25:18.197 --> 1:25:20.865
- Thank you, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:25:21.033 --> 1:25:22.950
- Attaboy.
- Thank you.

1:25:23.118 --> 1:25:24.660
Easy now.

1:25:24.828 --> 1:25:27.538
Thank you. Thank you.

1:25:28.665 --> 1:25:30.500
To your right.

1:26:31.395 --> 1:26:35.648
Get out. Are you kidding me?

1:26:38.151 --> 1:26:40.194
Kenny Fisher?

1:26:51.832 --> 1:26:55.209
- Are you guys a couple now?
- No. No.

1:26:55.544 --> 1:26:56.586
I don't know.

1:26:58.964 --> 1:27:00.214
Can I come to your wedding?

1:27:01.133 --> 1:27:04.677
Oh, I really should have
taken this one to the grave. Okay.

1:27:04.845 --> 1:27:09.140
Off of me, please, onto you.
Did you finally? Amanda?

1:27:11.310 --> 1:27:13.853
You did? And?

1:27:19.484 --> 1:27:21.611
Oh, Pres.

1:27:22.738 --> 1:27:25.323
It's okay. I'm okay.

1:27:26.575 --> 1:27:28.576
You know, I--

1:27:30.454 --> 1:27:33.539
We weren't meant to be
which, you know, sucks.

1:27:33.707 --> 1:27:36.000
But I know. It's over. It's done.

1:27:39.796 --> 1:27:41.380
I don't know.

1:27:42.674 --> 1:27:45.468
Maybe there isn't
such a thing as fate.

1:27:47.346 --> 1:27:49.555
Maybe it's all bullshit.

1:27:50.891 --> 1:27:53.184
I just-- I-- I feel like...

1:27:54.478 --> 1:27:57.605
Maybe it was a hero's trial.

1:27:58.857 --> 1:28:02.526
Something to make me
come out a better person.

1:28:06.698 --> 1:28:09.533
I'm trying to make the best of it.

1:28:11.870 --> 1:28:13.079
God.

1:28:13.288 --> 1:28:16.165
You know, it would have been cool
to make out with her though.

1:28:19.503 --> 1:28:21.879
Would you make out with me?

1:28:26.176 --> 1:28:29.261
- Call me when you get there, okay?
- Definitely.

1:28:31.807 --> 1:28:33.474
Take care.

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:37.228
Give me a hug.

1:28:42.234 --> 1:28:44.527
Take care of yourself, okay?

1:28:47.489 --> 1:28:51.117
Pres, just so you know...

1:28:52.035 --> 1:28:55.538
Just judging from
my little experience last night...

1:28:55.706 --> 1:28:58.541
...I do think
there's such a thing as fate.

1:29:00.043 --> 1:29:03.337
It just works in really
fucked-up ways sometimes.

1:29:05.382 --> 1:29:07.758
Especially in your case.

1:29:07.926 --> 1:29:11.887
I'm sorry. You gave that to me.
I had to take it.

1:29:12.055 --> 1:29:13.931
Peace out, G.

1:29:20.397 --> 1:29:22.398
Nobody understands
the value of a yearbook.

1:29:22.566 --> 1:29:26.027
- Memories are all we have.
- That's what I've been saying.

1:29:26.194 --> 1:29:31.907
All I know is tonight I'm gonna be
at some bar with chicks all over me.

1:29:32.075 --> 1:29:38.914
And you guys are gonna be at home
with your lame-ass girlfriends. Yeah.

1:29:39.082 --> 1:29:42.209
- Maybe we should break up with them.
- That's what I'm saying.

1:29:47.591 --> 1:29:50.718
Mike. Mike. Mike, I never
got a chance to thank you...

1:29:50.886 --> 1:29:52.595
...for covering for me last night.

1:29:52.763 --> 1:29:55.431
Thanks for telling the cops
all that stuff.

1:29:55.599 --> 1:29:59.393
I don't think I'm gonna be drinking
like that for a while, but thank you.

1:29:59.561 --> 1:30:01.562
Yo, no.

1:30:01.730 --> 1:30:04.690
Who said you could
sit with us, geek?

1:30:04.858 --> 1:30:07.443
Shouldn't you be home
playing with your computer?

1:30:07.611 --> 1:30:12.031
Yeah, why don't you go home
and watch Star Trek, Urkel?

1:30:13.992 --> 1:30:15.242
Urkel.

1:30:16.495 --> 1:30:18.579
- Urkel.
- Urkel.

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:34.386
Urkel.

1:30:53.115 --> 1:30:54.490
- Dude.
- Genius.

1:30:58.995 --> 1:31:01.080
Yeah, you want some of this?

1:31:49.337 --> 1:31:52.756
The Boston Bullet
now boarding at Track 28.

1:31:52.924 --> 1:31:55.384
Will passengers
with tickets for the Boston Bullet...

1:31:55.552 --> 1:31:58.596
...please board at Track 28?

1:32:00.849 --> 1:32:03.017
Excuse me. I think you dropped this.

1:32:07.105 --> 1:32:08.606
What are you doing here?

1:32:09.065 --> 1:32:12.026
Well, I talked to your dad
and he told me that you'd be here...

1:32:12.194 --> 1:32:13.944
...so I just thought that I would...

1:32:17.574 --> 1:32:20.242
- That's my letter.
- I thought it was my letter.

1:32:21.995 --> 1:32:25.664
Yeah, of course it's your letter.
I mean-- I just...

1:32:27.334 --> 1:32:30.085
- Did you read it?
- Yeah.

1:32:32.881 --> 1:32:35.758
Let me just say that I don't know
what I put in that letter...

1:32:35.926 --> 1:32:38.802
- ...because I wrote it so many times--
- Thank you.

1:32:40.555 --> 1:32:42.473
Thank you.

1:32:43.099 --> 1:32:46.977
I mean, you're welcome.

1:32:47.938 --> 1:32:49.647
So...

1:32:50.941 --> 1:32:52.983
...you're leaving now?

1:32:55.320 --> 1:32:57.196
Oh, God.

1:32:58.406 --> 1:33:02.743
- Yeah. It's just--
- Really bad timing?

1:33:07.207 --> 1:33:08.249
Yeah.

1:33:13.672 --> 1:33:16.215
I've got this workshop...

1:33:17.050 --> 1:33:20.386
...with Kurt Vonnegut and--
He's my hero and--

1:33:20.553 --> 1:33:23.347
Wow, that's great.

1:33:23.515 --> 1:33:25.766
That's really great. Congratulations.

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:29.228
Thanks.

1:33:31.064 --> 1:33:35.025
Well, you should--
You should probably go, then.

1:33:35.986 --> 1:33:38.153
You know, maybe it's better this way.

1:33:39.489 --> 1:33:42.992
Maybe I should just be single
for a while or something.

1:33:49.541 --> 1:33:51.041
Sure.

1:33:51.376 --> 1:33:56.171
Maybe it's like you said. You know,
all this happened for a reason.

1:33:57.382 --> 1:33:59.383
I said that, didn't I?

1:34:02.220 --> 1:34:03.929
Well...

1:34:04.514 --> 1:34:06.849
Preston, good luck.

1:34:07.851 --> 1:34:09.727
Yeah, you too.

1:34:13.773 --> 1:34:15.733
I'll see you.

1:34:50.101 --> 1:34:54.396
You know, there's probably
a later train I could take.

1:36:08.221 --> 1:36:11.014
- I can't believe we jumped William.
- Yeah.

1:36:11.182 --> 1:36:13.475
I can't believe
we didn't go into the party.

1:36:13.643 --> 1:36:16.770
- It probably sucked anyway.
- Probably.

1:36:16.938 --> 1:36:20.023
- Those people are totally boring.
- Yeah.

1:36:20.191 --> 1:36:23.193
This town is so lame.

1:36:23.361 --> 1:36:25.195
Tell me about it.

1:36:25.363 --> 1:36:28.282
Nothing exciting ever happens here.

1:40:25.436 --> 1:40:28.939
I'll kick everyone's ass in this room!
