(<i>dance music playing</i>)

00:08.292 --> 00:14.499
(<i>indistinct conversations</i>)

00:20.834 --> 00:22.067
I knew you'd come back.

00:22.167 --> 00:23.775
Piper...
Phoebe was worried,

00:23.875 --> 00:24.567
Prue was a wreck,

00:24.667 --> 00:26.399
but I knew you'd find a way.

00:26.499 --> 00:27.276
We need to talk.

00:27.376 --> 00:29.525
Leo, you haven't
kissed me in over a week.

00:29.625 --> 00:32.418
Don't you think
maybe that takes priority?

00:42.292 --> 00:44.734
I came to say good-bye.

00:44.834 --> 00:45.442
What?

00:45.542 --> 00:46.483
They told us
to break up

00:46.583 --> 00:48.442
when they caught us trying
to get married.

00:48.542 --> 00:51.859
So, uh, we won't
get married, we'll wait.

00:51.959 --> 00:53.276
It's too late;
we broke the rules.

00:53.376 --> 00:55.775
(<i>echoing</i>):
Now they won't let us
see each other again.

00:55.875 --> 01:00.399
(<i>echoing</i>):
Wait a minute-- they won't what?

01:00.499 --> 01:01.901
I don't care what they do to me,

01:02.001 --> 01:03.692
but I couldn't bear
anything happening to you.

01:03.792 --> 01:06.775
(<i>fading</i>):
I shouldn't
even be here right now.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.399
Wait, Leo, I can't hear you.

01:09.499 --> 01:10.399
What are you saying?

01:10.499 --> 01:13.625
(<i>faint</i>):
You have to forget about me.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.692
No...

01:17.792 --> 01:21.167
(<i>mouthing</i>)

01:24.251 --> 01:25.500
Leo!

01:26.750 --> 01:30.984
(<i>Piper gasping, dance music
 throbbing distantly</i>)

01:31.084 --> 01:33.499
(<i>echoing</i>):
Leo!

01:35.499 --> 01:36.734
(<i>echoing</i>):
Piper!

01:36.834 --> 01:39.359
Piper!

01:39.459 --> 01:41.334
Piper, wake up!

01:42.459 --> 01:46.084
Piper!
(<i>gasping</i>)

01:48.583 --> 01:51.917
Leo's not coming back.

01:52.959 --> 01:56.483
Honey, it was just a bad dream.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.276
No, it wasn't.

01:58.376 --> 01:59.817
It was real.

01:59.917 --> 02:04.399
(<i>crying</i>):
I don't understand.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.399
Why are they
doing this to us?

02:06.499 --> 02:10.901
It's like destroying lives
is how they amuse themselves.

02:11.001 --> 02:12.734
Piper, watch what you say.

02:12.834 --> 02:14.984
Why?
What are they gonna do to me?

02:15.084 --> 02:19.042
They couldn't hurt me more
than they already have.

02:27.834 --> 02:29.399
(<i>music playing</i>)

02:29.499 --> 02:32.276
(<i>cell phone ringing</i>)

02:32.376 --> 02:35.276
Don't you
just love cell phones?

02:35.376 --> 02:36.734
Hey, uh, it's me.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.399
It's amazing how much stress

02:38.499 --> 02:40.692
you can project
with so few words, Prue.

02:40.792 --> 02:43.026
I will have your
precious car home momentarily.

02:43.126 --> 02:45.400
Phoebe, I am not
calling about the car,

02:45.500 --> 02:46.609
I'm calling about Piper.

02:46.709 --> 02:50.483
Look, um, she had
this dream about Leo,

02:50.583 --> 02:51.483
and maybe I'm overreacting,

02:51.583 --> 02:53.359
but I've never
seen her like this.

02:53.459 --> 02:56.318
It's-it's like she's
completely given up.

02:56.418 --> 02:58.318
What kind
of dream about Le-- oh!!

02:58.418 --> 03:01.901
(<i>tires screeching</i>)

03:02.001 --> 03:02.442
Phoebe?

03:02.542 --> 03:03.942
I'm fine, the car's fine,

03:04.042 --> 03:06.001
I'll see you later, bye.

03:09.001 --> 03:10.359
Hi. Are you okay?

03:10.459 --> 03:12.609
You can't have it!
Leave me alone!

03:12.709 --> 03:15.499
I won't give it to you!
Leave me alone!

03:20.500 --> 03:24.499
(<i>panting</i>)

03:25.667 --> 03:27.084
(<i>grunts</i>)

03:28.042 --> 03:30.692
(<i>eerie growling</i>)

03:30.792 --> 03:32.834
(<i>screams</i>)

03:36.334 --> 03:38.276
It's okay.

03:38.376 --> 03:39.399
It's okay.

03:39.499 --> 03:41.709
You're safe. You're safe.

04:39.917 --> 04:40.942
Okay...

04:41.042 --> 04:44.399
you just have to be very careful
because it's hot,

04:44.499 --> 04:45.901
so blow on it, okay?

04:46.001 --> 04:49.192
Hey, did you find out
any more from her?

04:49.292 --> 04:50.525
Name, rank and serial number.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.525
Uh, her parents are on the way,
they live up the street.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.167
They were very worried
about you.

04:57.792 --> 05:00.775
I'm gonna go to the car
and get her jacket.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.609
Uh, keys?

05:02.709 --> 05:03.276
What?

05:03.376 --> 05:04.525
You know-- silver shiny things

05:04.625 --> 05:06.109
that go jingle, jingle?

05:06.209 --> 05:07.901
I don't have them.

05:08.001 --> 05:09.399
That's so weird.

05:09.499 --> 05:10.984
I put them up here.

05:11.084 --> 05:14.499
The fairies probably hid them.

05:15.209 --> 05:16.817
What was that?

05:16.917 --> 05:20.609
Sorry. I'm not supposed
to talk about fairies.

05:20.709 --> 05:22.692
Um, you know what?

05:22.792 --> 05:25.859
In this house, you can talk
about anything you want.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.359
Sometimes we talk
about weird things, too.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.109
Well, that's what
fairies do.

05:32.209 --> 05:34.525
Hide your keys and things.

05:34.625 --> 05:36.399
They're tricky
like that.

05:36.499 --> 05:40.483
Um, is that what's in that box?

05:40.583 --> 05:43.834
Is it a fairy?

05:44.499 --> 05:46.234
Is that who
you're protecting?

05:46.334 --> 05:48.499
(<i>doorbell chimes</i>)

05:49.625 --> 05:51.692
That's probably your
mom and your dad.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.399
He's not my dad.

05:53.499 --> 05:57.209
He's just my mom's
new husband.

05:59.834 --> 06:02.276
Hi, we're
Kate's parents.

06:02.376 --> 06:03.318
Is she all right?

06:03.418 --> 06:03.942
Yeah, she's fine.

06:04.042 --> 06:06.067
I mean, she scraped
her arm a little bit,

06:06.167 --> 06:08.399
but mostly
she's just scared.

06:08.499 --> 06:09.359
Kate?

06:09.459 --> 06:10.650
Get out of the doorway!

06:10.750 --> 06:11.399
Kate...

06:11.499 --> 06:14.418
It's an in-between,
get out of the in-between!

06:17.334 --> 06:18.067
What's an in-between?

06:18.167 --> 06:19.442
It's where the trolls are.

06:19.542 --> 06:20.109
Honey,

06:20.209 --> 06:22.525
we've had this
conversation before.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.734
You're a big girl
and it's time

06:24.834 --> 06:27.625
to stop believing
in things like that.

06:29.292 --> 06:32.026
She's had
some problems...

06:32.126 --> 06:33.942
since her father
and I divorced.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.399
Regressed,
sort of,

06:36.499 --> 06:38.399
back to the "imaginary
friend" stage.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.525
Look, uh, we...

06:39.625 --> 06:40.984
we should go;
it's late.

06:41.084 --> 06:44.859
Thank you again
for everything.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.483
They'll get us.

06:46.583 --> 06:49.399
I won't let them.

06:49.499 --> 06:52.418
It's okay.
Come on.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.625
KATE:
Look, there it is!

07:09.334 --> 07:11.276
Uh... thank you.

07:11.376 --> 07:13.418
You're welcome.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.483
Come on, Phoebe.

07:20.583 --> 07:21.775
Trolls and fairies?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.525
You don't believe that stuff.

07:23.625 --> 07:24.775
Sure, why not?

07:24.875 --> 07:28.399
Well, maybe it's time
we tell her about Santa.

07:28.499 --> 07:32.151
All I know is something
was definitely after her.

07:32.251 --> 07:33.399
But you didn't see anything.

07:33.499 --> 07:35.442
No, but how else
did she get hurt?

07:35.542 --> 07:37.109
How about
she fell down

07:37.209 --> 07:37.984
and scratched herself?

07:38.084 --> 07:39.817
No, Piper,
they weren't scratches,

07:39.917 --> 07:40.650
they were claw marks.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.817
If they were, you would have
seen what had clawed her.

07:43.917 --> 07:45.650
Why are you being
so stubborn about this?

07:45.750 --> 07:48.709
Because I'm a Scorpio.
What's your excuse?

07:49.251 --> 07:50.399
Okay.

07:50.499 --> 07:51.775
So it's kinda late and, um,

07:51.875 --> 07:52.942
we're all a little bit tired,

07:53.042 --> 07:55.318
so how about we finish
this up tomorrow?

07:55.418 --> 07:56.067
Now look what
you did.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.525
You went and turned Prue
into the middle child.

07:58.625 --> 07:59.234
Okay, Phoebe.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.234
Even if fairies
and trolls do exist,

08:01.334 --> 08:02.318
you heard what her mom said.

08:02.418 --> 08:04.525
The problem started
when her father left.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.026
That's psychology,

08:06.126 --> 08:07.276
not magic.

08:07.376 --> 08:07.942
I know.

08:08.042 --> 08:08.692
But you know what?

08:08.792 --> 08:10.692
I'm gonna check <i>The Book of
 Shadows</i> just in case.

08:10.792 --> 08:13.318
'Cause I don't want to be
out-stubborned by a Gemini.

08:13.418 --> 08:16.499
(<i>tea pot whistling</i>)

08:19.667 --> 08:22.251
Good night, sweetie.

08:27.418 --> 08:27.901
No, don't!

08:28.001 --> 08:29.151
The tweens!

08:29.251 --> 08:30.399
They come out of the shadows!

08:30.499 --> 08:35.042
Honey, just go to sleep, okay?

08:36.833 --> 08:39.625
(<i>door creaking</i>)

08:42.833 --> 08:44.500
Please...

08:45.042 --> 08:48.650
(<i>eerie voice
snickering, muttering</i>)

08:48.750 --> 08:50.151
Go away.

08:50.251 --> 08:52.399
(<i>eerie voice muttering</i>)

08:52.499 --> 08:53.792
Leave us alone.

08:54.334 --> 08:58.042
(<i>eerie muttering
 continues</i>)

09:01.209 --> 09:02.667
(<i>screams</i>)

09:04.500 --> 09:06.399
(<i>footsteps approaching</i>)

09:06.499 --> 09:08.209
PRUE:
Hey.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.399
Check this out.

09:11.499 --> 09:13.525
We each drew one.

09:13.625 --> 09:14.525
Lilly...

09:14.625 --> 09:16.399
Do you remember her?
She was our little

09:16.499 --> 09:18.399
imaginary friend we
had when we were kids.

09:18.499 --> 09:21.151
I have not thought
about Lilly in years.

09:21.251 --> 09:25.399
That's because you grew up
and you stopped seeing her.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.692
Okay...

09:27.792 --> 09:29.984
"Fairies,
elves and trolls

09:30.084 --> 09:30.787
"are mystical creatures

09:30.797 --> 09:32.775
"that live in a realm
parallel to ours,

09:32.875 --> 09:35.525
but separated by
a thin veil."

09:35.625 --> 09:38.234
<i>The Enchanted Realm?</i>

09:38.334 --> 09:41.984
"A thin veil which lifts
only in tween places."

09:42.084 --> 09:42.817
Tween places, Prue.

09:42.917 --> 09:46.026
That's like a realm
in between two things.

09:46.126 --> 09:49.567
Like doorways
and windows, um, shadows...

09:49.667 --> 09:50.318
Shadows?

09:50.418 --> 09:52.026
In between light and dark.

09:52.126 --> 09:53.399
And it's exactly
what Kate said,

09:53.499 --> 09:54.859
trolls live in the in-between.

09:54.959 --> 09:58.276
Right, but when you found Kate,
she wasn't in an in-between.

09:58.376 --> 10:00.318
Mm, actually,
she was in the biggest

10:00.418 --> 10:02.318
in-between of all-- midnight.

10:02.418 --> 10:03.901
"In the hour between
night and day,

10:04.001 --> 10:05.692
the world itself
becomes a tween."

10:05.792 --> 10:08.650
Okay, so why isn't there
anything in <i>The Book of Shadows?</i>

10:08.750 --> 10:11.942
Because <i>The Book of Shadows</i>
was written by adults,

10:12.042 --> 10:12.609
and I'm assuming

10:12.709 --> 10:16.084
that scary-looking dude
in your picture...

10:16.499 --> 10:17.234
...is a troll.

10:17.334 --> 10:20.067
So then why
is he trying to hurt Kate?

10:20.167 --> 10:22.399
I don't know.
We have to ask Kate.

10:22.499 --> 10:23.192
(<i>phone ringing</i>)

10:23.292 --> 10:25.359
And we will fill Piper in
on the way.

10:25.459 --> 10:28.026
You know, maybe we should
just do this one on our own.

10:28.126 --> 10:30.399
You know, I mean,
Piper's kind of out of it.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.399
Even more reason
to drag her along--

10:32.499 --> 10:34.859
take her mind off of Leo.

10:34.959 --> 10:37.625
PIPER:
Phoebe! Phone!

10:41.334 --> 10:43.234
It's your little
lawyer boyfriend.

10:43.334 --> 10:44.276
So there.

10:44.376 --> 10:46.400
And he is not
my boyfriend.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.775
Weird.

10:47.875 --> 10:48.483
Hello?

10:48.583 --> 10:49.984
Who's not your boyfriend?

10:50.084 --> 10:53.400
Um... the... mailman.

10:53.500 --> 10:58.483
Uh, yeah, sometimes Piper
likes to tease me because I like

10:58.583 --> 11:01.151
to get the mail... a lot.

11:01.251 --> 11:02.067
Uh, so how are you?

11:02.167 --> 11:04.734
Well, it's a beautiful morning
and I got

11:04.834 --> 11:07.026
a beautiful woman on the phone,

11:07.126 --> 11:08.775
so things could be worse.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.234
God, I sound like
Billy Appleby.

11:12.334 --> 11:14.151
What?

11:14.251 --> 11:15.399
Nothing.

11:15.499 --> 11:17.026
No, wait,
what did you just say?

11:17.126 --> 11:20.609
Billy Appleby's just this
hokey guy from this old movie

11:20.709 --> 11:23.400
I watched too many times
when I was a kid.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.400
BOTH:
<i>Kill It Before It Dies.</i>

11:25.500 --> 11:26.525
You've seen it?

11:26.625 --> 11:28.234
Once or twice.

11:28.334 --> 11:28.662
Really?

11:28.672 --> 11:32.542
Too bad it's not playing,
I'd take you to see it.

11:33.583 --> 11:36.234
Course, we could always
have dinner instead.

11:36.334 --> 11:39.109
Are you asking me out,
counselor?

11:39.209 --> 11:40.499
Guilty.

11:43.084 --> 11:44.399
How about tonight?

11:44.499 --> 11:46.067
I could stop by your place.

11:46.167 --> 11:47.318
PHOEBE:
Uh, really?

11:47.418 --> 11:48.399
Uh, well.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.650
Um...

11:49.750 --> 11:50.859
Um, actually,
tonight's not good

11:50.959 --> 11:53.109
because Piper is going
through something.

11:53.209 --> 11:53.662
But I will call you

11:53.672 --> 11:56.525
and-and maybe we could
meet at the club, okay?

11:56.625 --> 11:57.399
Oh, sorry, bye.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.251
(<i>line clicks, dial tone</i>)

12:09.499 --> 12:12.334
(<i>running footsteps
 approaching</i>)

12:12.500 --> 12:14.525
Did you not look
at those drawings?

12:14.625 --> 12:16.192
They're cute, yes.

12:16.292 --> 12:17.399
Cute... Cute?

12:17.499 --> 12:20.400
We all had the same
invisible fairy friend, Piper.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.234
That is proof
that fairies exist.

12:23.334 --> 12:25.209
Or...

12:26.499 --> 12:28.192
...it proves that one of us

12:28.292 --> 12:30.318
had a really fertile
imagination,

12:30.418 --> 12:32.775
and the other two
were really big copycats.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.400
Okay, Piper,

12:34.500 --> 12:34.984
honey,

12:35.084 --> 12:37.817
just listen to me, okay?
Um...

12:37.917 --> 12:39.525
we think that
Kate's in trouble,

12:39.625 --> 12:41.399
our kind of trouble.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.692
Okay, well, I don't.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.567
And after what they did to Leo,

12:45.667 --> 12:47.234
I'm not really
all that motivated

12:47.334 --> 12:49.399
to go dig up demons for them.

12:49.499 --> 12:50.775
Trolls.

12:50.875 --> 12:51.399
Whatever.

12:51.499 --> 12:53.234
Look, you guys can do

12:53.334 --> 12:54.109
whatever you want.

12:54.209 --> 12:56.650
But I've had it.
And I'm done.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.525
What does that mean?

12:58.625 --> 13:02.318
That means that,
um, the powers that be

13:02.418 --> 13:05.399
haven't done anything
but ruin my life, so therefore

13:05.499 --> 13:08.942
I'm not gonna do anything
for them any more, okay?

13:09.042 --> 13:10.192
I'm going now.

13:10.292 --> 13:11.692
Excuse me.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.334
I'm going now.

13:16.499 --> 13:19.499
I think she's on strike.

13:30.334 --> 13:32.251
(<i>knocking on door</i>)

13:33.418 --> 13:34.399
Kate...

13:34.499 --> 13:37.667
someone's here
to see you.

13:48.001 --> 13:49.359
PRUE:
Hey.

13:49.459 --> 13:52.609
So, um... we brought you
your jacket.

13:52.709 --> 13:53.567
We had to use

13:53.667 --> 13:55.399
the spare key to get
into the car, though.

13:55.499 --> 13:58.276
I guess the fairies
hid them after all.

13:58.376 --> 13:59.400
Told you.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.650
What are you drawing?

14:01.750 --> 14:03.775
That looks like
a very scary cave.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.667
PRUE:
You know...

14:06.750 --> 14:08.542
<i>...that</i> looks
a lot like mine.

14:09.499 --> 14:10.567
That's a fairy and a troll.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.734
My mom says I'm making them up.

14:12.834 --> 14:14.418
But I'm not.

14:15.084 --> 14:18.400
Well, we believe you, okay?

14:18.500 --> 14:19.399
We just need you
to tell us

14:19.499 --> 14:22.067
everything that you know,
so that we can help.

14:22.167 --> 14:23.442
I don't know that much.

14:23.542 --> 14:25.734
Thistle's kind of hard
to understand.

14:25.834 --> 14:28.400
Fairies don't talk
the same way people do.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.609
Thistle?

14:30.709 --> 14:31.525
I saved her.

14:31.625 --> 14:34.734
See, the fairies are the bosses
of the enchanted kingdom.

14:34.834 --> 14:37.399
But the trolls wish
they were the bosses.

14:37.499 --> 14:38.359
So they kidnapped Thistle

14:38.459 --> 14:40.399
from the king and queen
of the fairies.

14:40.499 --> 14:42.775
So Thistle is a princess?

14:42.875 --> 14:43.399
Mm-hmm.

14:43.499 --> 14:44.984
But the trolls
are gonna kill her

14:45.084 --> 14:47.442
unless her parents
hand over the kingdom.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.483
It's a miniature coup d'Ã©tat.

14:49.583 --> 14:51.483
But I found her
tied up

14:51.583 --> 14:53.399
in the cave and I saved her.

14:53.499 --> 14:54.901
That was very brave of you.

14:55.001 --> 14:58.650
But now the trolls hate me
'cause I won't give her back.

14:58.750 --> 15:02.026
Most of the times I can stay
out of the in-betweens,

15:02.126 --> 15:03.318
but at midnight...

15:03.418 --> 15:05.234
There's no place to hide.

15:05.334 --> 15:07.192
Yeah, we know.

15:07.292 --> 15:10.292
Can we see her?

15:11.084 --> 15:11.984
No,

15:12.084 --> 15:13.399
only children can see fairies.

15:13.499 --> 15:16.276
Well, I don't know if this
is gonna help at all,

15:16.376 --> 15:21.625
but Prue and I, we're very in
touch with our inner children.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.834
Can we at least try?

15:25.625 --> 15:26.234
(<i>sighs</i>)

15:26.334 --> 15:28.567
We'll have to go into
an in-between.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.692
Watch out for trolls.

15:30.792 --> 15:32.500
Okay.

15:56.499 --> 15:59.001
You can't help
if you can't see her.

16:02.959 --> 16:05.192
Thistle says that if you
really believe in fairies,

16:05.292 --> 16:08.109
there's something that'll
make you innocent again,

16:08.209 --> 16:09.542
so you can see them.

16:18.292 --> 16:22.376
(<i>giggles</i>)

16:23.334 --> 16:26.318
(<i>giggling</i>)

16:26.418 --> 16:28.359
I think it worked.

16:28.459 --> 16:30.959
I want to see
the fairy.

16:59.001 --> 16:59.942
PRUE and PHOEBE:
âª ...really show it âª

17:00.042 --> 17:02.775
âª If you're happy and you
know it, clap your hands âª

âª If you're happy and
you know it, pat your knee âª

17:08.209 --> 17:10.026
âª If you're happy
and you know it âª
Oh, my God.

17:10.126 --> 17:12.400
âª Pat your knee âª
You guys got to do it.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.151
âª If you're happy
and you know it âª

17:14.251 --> 17:16.817
âª Then your face

What the hell
is going on?

17:20.291 --> 17:20.912
You think this is bad?

17:20.922 --> 17:22.817
You should have been here
for <i>"FrÃ¨re Jacques."</i>

17:22.916 --> 17:25.901

and you know it... âª

17:27.291 --> 17:29.399
I didn't serve 'em,

All right, put on some music,
any music

17:32.376 --> 17:33.079
and kill that microphone.

Hi. Lost your minds?

17:41.001 --> 17:42.525
Piper, we have been
waiting and waiting

17:42.625 --> 17:44.399
and waiting.
Uh-huh.Yeah.

17:44.499 --> 17:45.399
And you know
what we did?

17:45.499 --> 17:46.692
We saw a fairy,
and she was very cute,

17:46.792 --> 17:47.413
and she was sparkly,

17:47.423 --> 17:49.399
and she was sparkly,
and really, really pretty.

17:50.834 --> 17:51.399
Okay.

17:51.499 --> 17:54.567
What ass-backward spell
did you guys cast?

17:54.667 --> 17:56.276
We-we didn't cast a spell.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.276
No, it is true,
we did not
cast a spell,

17:58.376 --> 18:00.859
but we did use
fairy dust.
(<i>chuckles</i>)

18:00.959 --> 18:02.399
Fairy dust.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.901
Yes.
Okay, great.

18:04.001 --> 18:05.151
So you can go home now

18:05.251 --> 18:07.192
and reverse it, Tinkerbell.

18:07.292 --> 18:08.399
No, no.

18:08.499 --> 18:10.400
No, I am not a fairy.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.650
She thought I was...

18:11.750 --> 18:13.399
We have to show her.

18:13.499 --> 18:14.609
Okay.

18:14.709 --> 18:15.901
(<i>softly</i>):
Ready?

18:16.001 --> 18:16.692
Uh-huh.

Okay, go.

What the hell
did you do that for?

18:24.334 --> 18:26.609
That did not work!

18:26.709 --> 18:27.359
No.

18:27.459 --> 18:29.067
Work... that's a very good idea.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.567
I'm gonna go back to work now.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.399
(<i>music, conversation return</i>)

18:41.042 --> 18:43.026
Because, now, I have the key,

18:43.126 --> 18:43.901
so Thistle is safe.

18:44.001 --> 18:46.567
And we have to be back
with Kate at midnight

18:46.667 --> 18:49.234
so when
the trolls attack...
No.

18:49.334 --> 18:50.067
You guys are

going home,

18:51.001 --> 18:51.901
and you're not driving, either

18:52.001 --> 18:54.525
'cause someone will think
you're drunk or something.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.775
So go outside, and wait there,

and I will call a cab.

Now, just... No!

into ending my strike,

scary, but, um...

come after us

at midnight,

so all's we have to do

is go home and

We're at home.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.525
The dust didn't work on Piper.

21:53.625 --> 21:55.359
Then she doesn't believe.

21:55.459 --> 21:56.399
What are we gonna do?

21:56.499 --> 21:59.109
I'm scared,
there's shadows everywhere,

21:59.209 --> 22:01.459
and it's almost midnight.

22:01.959 --> 22:02.692
Okay, listen, Kate--

22:02.792 --> 22:04.692
Okay, you don't
have to worry--

22:04.792 --> 22:06.483
that's what we
called to tell you--

22:06.583 --> 22:07.399
because the trolls know

22:07.499 --> 22:09.901
that we have the key now,
and they're not after

22:10.001 --> 22:12.567
you anymore,
they're after us.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.026
No, they're here, too.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.026
I can hear them.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.067
As long as we have the key,

22:17.167 --> 22:18.859
Thistle is safe.

22:18.959 --> 22:21.901
So just, uh, stay there and,

22:22.001 --> 22:23.650
and turn on all the lights

22:23.750 --> 22:25.399
and it'll disappear
the shadows.

22:25.499 --> 22:26.959
Yeah, yeah.

22:42.459 --> 22:44.499
(<i>growls</i>)

22:46.292 --> 22:49.442
Trolls.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.959
Let's go get 'em.

22:53.499 --> 22:55.692
BOTH:
Hi-yah!

22:55.792 --> 22:57.459
Whoo!

22:58.459 --> 22:59.709
Oh!

23:02.126 --> 23:03.984
Prue... that was

23:04.084 --> 23:06.942
a very, very big troll.

23:07.042 --> 23:08.192
That wasn't a troll,

23:08.292 --> 23:08.787
that was a demon!

23:08.797 --> 23:11.318
Okay, well, where does
he fit into the story?

23:11.418 --> 23:13.276
He was after
<i>The Book of Shadows.</i>

23:13.376 --> 23:14.399
All right, well,
you know what,

23:14.499 --> 23:16.442
we can't really worry
about him right now,

23:16.542 --> 23:17.901
'cause we have to get to Kate.

23:18.001 --> 23:19.399
Oh!

23:19.499 --> 23:20.399
Phoebe!

23:20.499 --> 23:21.400
(<i>troll shouting</i>)

23:21.500 --> 23:22.817
(<i>gasping</i>)

23:22.917 --> 23:24.192
Phoebe!

23:24.292 --> 23:25.209
Look out!

23:29.251 --> 23:31.834
(<i>both grunting</i>)

23:35.251 --> 23:36.499
Oh.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.984
Prue, they got the key.

23:40.084 --> 23:42.399
(<i>latch clicking</i>)

23:42.499 --> 23:44.042
COLE:
Phoebe...

23:48.750 --> 23:52.583
Are you two... okay?

23:58.792 --> 23:59.775
Hey, you know what?

23:59.875 --> 24:00.442
Can you just go?

24:00.542 --> 24:01.817
I'm really sorry
to rush you out,

24:01.917 --> 24:03.442
but we have something
very important

24:03.542 --> 24:04.399
to be taking care of.

24:04.499 --> 24:05.246
But you sure you're okay?

24:05.256 --> 24:07.276
I mean, that sounded
like a pretty nasty fall.

24:07.376 --> 24:09.026
Yeah, Cole, we're,
we're fine, really.

24:09.126 --> 24:10.775
You two seem different.

24:10.875 --> 24:11.609
Different?

24:11.709 --> 24:12.109
I mean,

24:12.209 --> 24:13.734
I thought maybe you were,
I don't know,

24:13.834 --> 24:16.650
drunk or something before,
but now you seem...

24:16.750 --> 24:17.625
Sober.

24:19.001 --> 24:22.292
Stairs can be... sobering.

24:24.499 --> 24:26.399
Right. Okay, um,

24:26.499 --> 24:27.734
I'm really sorry

24:27.834 --> 24:32.376
about our plans there, Cole.
I really am.

24:36.251 --> 24:39.499
No worries. I'll keep trying.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.859
Stairs can be sobering?

24:44.959 --> 24:46.775
Okay, what was I supposed
to say?

24:46.875 --> 24:49.399
That some unknown demon came in
to try and steal our magic book,

24:49.499 --> 24:52.567
and then little trolls came
and pushed us down the stairs?

24:52.667 --> 24:56.234
Right. Okay, but why
are we thinking like grownups

24:56.334 --> 24:56.787
all of a sudden?

24:56.797 --> 25:01.276
I don't know. It must have been
from the trauma of the attack.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.151
Which is probably
a really good thing

25:03.251 --> 25:04.942
because I don't really think
that our inner children

25:05.042 --> 25:06.399
would have a lot of luck
protecting Kate.

25:06.499 --> 25:08.399
And now that the trolls have
the key,

25:08.499 --> 25:10.917
we really need
to go protect Kate.

25:11.875 --> 25:15.499
Uh, hello, Prue?

25:16.376 --> 25:18.901
Okay, I don't
understand why

25:19.001 --> 25:21.318
we just don't get
to Kate.

25:21.418 --> 25:22.525
Well, because with
the dust worn off,

25:22.625 --> 25:23.537
we won't be able
to see the trolls.

25:23.547 --> 25:25.567
Okay, well,
I already looked in
<i>The Book of Shadows</i>

25:25.667 --> 25:27.318
and there's nothing
in there about trolls.

25:27.418 --> 25:29.483
I know.
I'm thinking of piecing together

25:29.583 --> 25:31.399
a makeshift spell like, uh,

25:31.499 --> 25:32.026
here--

25:32.126 --> 25:34.609
um, "To see what
can't be seen."

25:34.709 --> 25:35.942
If we combine that one
with the one

25:36.042 --> 25:38.859
to cultivate innocence
and the power-of-three spell,

25:38.959 --> 25:39.578
it just might work.

25:39.588 --> 25:41.525
That's why
you're the older sister.

25:41.625 --> 25:43.151
You are always thinking.

25:43.251 --> 25:43.662
Thank you.

25:43.672 --> 25:44.609
All right, I'll work
on the spell.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.667
Why don't you go call
Piper, okay?

25:47.625 --> 25:48.984
Um...

25:49.084 --> 25:49.984
what's the point
of that?

25:50.084 --> 25:51.399
Isn't she still
on the picket line?

25:51.499 --> 25:53.692
Yeah, but we can't fight
the trolls without her.

25:53.792 --> 25:55.067
I mean, they're just too fast.

25:55.167 --> 25:56.234
We need her to freeze them.

25:56.334 --> 25:57.609
You know, we may
have wanted her

25:57.709 --> 26:01.399
to be with us before,
but now we actually need her.

26:01.499 --> 26:02.399
Okay.

26:02.499 --> 26:03.620
Uh, hey, watch out for doorways
and stuff,

26:03.630 --> 26:05.775
because now that
the trolls know that
we're helping Kate,

26:05.875 --> 26:08.442
they'll do everything they can
to stop all three of us.

26:08.542 --> 26:10.499
Mm-hmm.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.442
(<i>troll muttering</i>)

(<i>troll muttering,

26:26.834 --> 26:27.359
Ow!

26:27.459 --> 26:30.734
Hey, Piper,
your sister's on the phone.

26:30.834 --> 26:32.399
Perfect.

26:32.499 --> 26:33.400
It's okay, I'll get it.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.625
I'll get it.
It's all right.

26:36.583 --> 26:39.276
Need a diaper change?

26:39.376 --> 26:40.192
Very funny.

26:40.292 --> 26:41.984
Look, we need you to come home
right away.

26:42.084 --> 26:43.026
By midnight or else...

26:43.126 --> 26:44.318
The tooth fairy is gonna come

26:44.418 --> 26:45.692
and harass us all
for not flossing?

26:45.792 --> 26:48.359
All right, I know you don't
believe in fairies,

26:48.459 --> 26:49.400
and I'm not asking you to.

26:49.500 --> 26:50.609
Then what are you asking?

26:50.709 --> 26:52.318
We were trying
to distract you before.

26:52.418 --> 26:54.859
We were trying to take your mind
off of Leo, okay?

26:54.959 --> 26:55.775
And it was wrong,

26:55.875 --> 26:56.775
and I'm sorry for that.

26:56.875 --> 26:58.525
But it's not about that
anymore, Piper.

26:58.625 --> 27:02.901
We are up against something that
we cannot fight without you.

27:03.001 --> 27:04.318
Trolls?

27:04.418 --> 27:05.399
Believe it or don't,

27:05.499 --> 27:06.525
but they are sneaky and mean

27:06.625 --> 27:11.042
and they're trying to hurt
a seven-year-old girl.

27:12.542 --> 27:13.692
Hello?

27:13.792 --> 27:15.525
Any chance
they may have been here?

27:15.625 --> 27:19.192
Yeah, one attacked me
there earlier, why?

27:19.292 --> 27:20.483
Nothing.

27:20.583 --> 27:22.609
All right, look,
they know that we're witches,

27:22.709 --> 27:25.399
and they will do anything
to stop us from helping Kate.

27:25.499 --> 27:27.234
All right, all right.
I'm on my way.

27:27.334 --> 27:29.151
Okay, well,
don't forget to stay

27:29.251 --> 27:29.942

27:39.709 --> 27:42.442

27:42.542 --> 27:43.318
Aren't they on the hook?

27:43.418 --> 27:46.359

I wouldn't be asking.

and close up for me?

You better run while you can,
you little rodents.

28:45.499 --> 28:50.026
I bet you guys think
this is real funny, don't you?

28:50.126 --> 28:51.151
Haven't you taken enough
from me?

28:51.251 --> 28:56.109
You have to send trolls
to kick me while I'm down?!

28:56.209 --> 29:00.609
I had a nice normal life once,
and you took that from me.

29:00.709 --> 29:02.901
You took my boyfriend,
you took my life.

29:03.001 --> 29:09.499
The least you could do is leave
me my freaking car keys!

29:10.334 --> 29:13.234
I am a good person.
I'm a good witch.

29:13.334 --> 29:16.399
And damn it, I would have made
a great wife.

29:16.499 --> 29:20.067
And how dare you take that
from me.

29:20.167 --> 29:21.399
I deserve...

29:21.499 --> 29:22.942
No, you know what?

29:23.042 --> 29:24.442
I demand...

29:24.542 --> 29:27.359
that you send him back to me.

29:27.459 --> 29:28.942
You hear me? Right now.

29:29.042 --> 29:31.901
I'm going to stand
in this very spot

29:32.001 --> 29:35.499
until you send Leo back to me.

29:44.084 --> 29:47.276
(<i>slowly ticking</i>)

29:47.376 --> 29:48.525
She said that
she was coming, right?

29:48.625 --> 29:51.399
What, did you think I
just made that part up?

29:51.499 --> 29:52.399
No, but it is
almost 12:00,

29:52.499 --> 29:53.494
and we still have to go
over to Kate's.

29:53.504 --> 29:55.859
Well, maybe we should
do it without her;

29:55.959 --> 29:56.817
do the best we can.

29:56.917 --> 29:58.650
No. I used
the power-of-three spell.

29:58.750 --> 29:59.942
It won't work without her.

30:00.042 --> 30:00.984
Well, you can rewrite it.

30:01.084 --> 30:01.901
In six minutes?

30:02.001 --> 30:03.399
Do you have a better idea?

30:03.499 --> 30:04.984

30:05.084 --> 30:06.692
Sorry I'm late.

30:06.792 --> 30:08.734
Hey. Are you okay?

30:08.834 --> 30:10.901
I thought this wasn't about me.

30:11.001 --> 30:12.276
Well, it just...

30:12.376 --> 30:14.399
You don't really seem
like you're very open.

30:14.499 --> 30:17.359
I'm as open as I'm going to get
in the next five minutes,

30:17.459 --> 30:19.542
so let's just do the damn spell.

to lay off the rhyming, Prue.

30:37.834 --> 30:42.234
All right, well, um,
let's just go ring the doorbell.

30:42.334 --> 30:43.609

Kate's parents

30:43.709 --> 30:45.442
so that we can get
past them, okay?

30:45.542 --> 30:47.026
Fine. Whatever.

we see them?!

32:23.709 --> 32:25.067
just disappeared.

32:25.167 --> 32:25.483
Unless

32:25.583 --> 32:27.901
the trolls turned her
into a fairy?

32:28.001 --> 32:29.859
A fairy?
Why would they do that?

32:29.959 --> 32:30.399
I have no idea.

32:30.499 --> 32:34.167
Maybe to punish her
for taking Thistle.

32:34.917 --> 32:37.734
But we have to find Kate.

32:37.834 --> 32:40.650
Okay, come on,
give me a premonition.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.192
I don't understand.

32:42.292 --> 32:44.734
I mean, why couldn't
we see the trolls?

32:44.834 --> 32:46.442
We've had spells backfire
on us before,

32:46.542 --> 32:48.109
but never the power of three.

32:48.209 --> 32:49.650
It didn't backfire.

32:49.750 --> 32:54.334
The spell didn't work
because of me.

32:55.126 --> 32:55.734
Piper.

32:55.834 --> 32:57.359
No, it's... it's true.

32:57.459 --> 32:59.399
This is all my fault.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.817
I just...

33:01.917 --> 33:02.859
I wanted to save Kate.

33:02.959 --> 33:07.151
I never meant to hurt her,
I never meant for this to...

33:07.251 --> 33:08.775
Don't blame
yourself, okay.

33:08.875 --> 33:11.567
I mean you have
every right to be angry.

33:11.667 --> 33:14.817
But not at the expense
of a little girl.

33:14.917 --> 33:16.399
I just...
I don't understand

33:16.499 --> 33:21.399
how I'm supposed to believe
in anything anymore.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.583
I just want him back, Prue.

33:26.334 --> 33:27.775
I know.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.399
But, right now, we have
to get Kate back, okay?

33:30.499 --> 33:33.399
And we're going to need
your help to do that.

33:33.499 --> 33:35.192
PHOEBE:
Damn it!
Damn it!

33:35.292 --> 33:35.650
Damn it!

33:35.750 --> 33:38.234
I don't understand
what good is this power

33:38.334 --> 33:40.276
if I can't use it
when I need it?

33:40.376 --> 33:42.026
Phoebe,
you have to focus.

33:42.126 --> 33:44.399
Oh, Prue, I am focusing,
believe me.

33:44.499 --> 33:47.151
You're too upset,
so take a deep breath,

33:47.251 --> 33:48.567
Uh, guys...
and try again.

33:48.667 --> 33:49.692
I can't levitate when I want to,

33:49.792 --> 33:51.399
I can't premonition...
Guys!

33:51.499 --> 33:52.067
What?

33:52.167 --> 33:55.583
I think the spell is working.

33:57.126 --> 33:58.234
(<i>gasps</i>)

33:58.334 --> 34:00.042
Oh.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.151
Do you see it?

34:07.251 --> 34:09.399
What's it doing?

34:09.498 --> 34:12.498
I think it wants us
to follow it.

34:35.792 --> 34:38.234
I think he got scared away.

34:38.333 --> 34:38.911
Yeah, and I can see why.

34:38.922 --> 34:40.775
This looks like the cave
from Kate's drawing.

34:40.875 --> 34:44.150
First troll I see
is in really big trouble.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.542
Let's go.

34:55.126 --> 34:58.959
(<i>indistinct chattering</i>)

35:02.875 --> 35:04.499
Troll central.

35:04.959 --> 35:07.499
(<i>cackling</i>)

35:13.292 --> 35:13.912
What are they doing?

35:13.922 --> 35:15.817
PRUE:
It looks like they're
trying to start

35:15.917 --> 35:17.359
a fire, although
I don't really think

35:17.459 --> 35:19.067
that it's for roasting
marshmallows.

35:19.167 --> 35:20.442
Kate and Thistle.

35:20.542 --> 35:24.067
(<i>growling</i>)

35:24.167 --> 35:25.109
(<i>Kate screams</i>)

35:25.209 --> 35:29.151
Oh...
(<i>Kate gasping, grunting</i>)

35:29.251 --> 35:30.318
All right, Piper, do you think

35:30.418 --> 35:32.234
that you can freeze them
from here?

35:32.334 --> 35:33.525
I can try.

35:33.625 --> 35:36.418
(<i>startled yells</i>)

35:39.583 --> 35:42.667
Piper, freeze them!
They're too fast!

35:49.750 --> 35:51.399
One down.

35:51.499 --> 35:52.875
Oh, Kate!

35:55.499 --> 35:58.625
Okay. Prue, a little help here!

36:00.625 --> 36:02.499
Whoa!

36:03.917 --> 36:05.542
(<i>grunting</i>)

36:07.292 --> 36:08.109
Piper, run.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.399
PIPER:
Run? Run where?

36:09.499 --> 36:10.734
Just run, Piper, run!

36:10.834 --> 36:13.567
Freeze the flames!

36:13.667 --> 36:16.399
PRUE:
Unfreeze, now.

36:16.499 --> 36:19.542
(<i>trolls yelling</i>)

36:20.792 --> 36:26.084
Ooh. Now, that is just the way
I like my trolls-- medium well.

36:26.499 --> 36:28.542
(<i>Phoebe chuckling</i>)

36:29.084 --> 36:31.984
PHOEBE:
Hi, here you guys go.

36:32.084 --> 36:34.609
It's okay;
there you go.

36:34.709 --> 36:36.901
Um, hey, hey,

36:37.001 --> 36:39.499
hey, you guys, wait, wait up.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.359
Thistle, don't you know

36:41.459 --> 36:43.376
how to turn Kate
back into a person?

36:44.376 --> 36:46.859
PHOEBE:
Kate, you know,

36:46.959 --> 36:47.859
you can't stay a fairy,

36:47.959 --> 36:51.667
because if you do,
your mom will be very sad.

36:55.084 --> 36:57.318
Um...

36:57.418 --> 36:58.276
You know what?

36:58.376 --> 37:01.109
I think I kind of know
how you're feeling.

37:01.209 --> 37:04.734
When someone you love goes away,
it doesn't make any sense,

37:04.834 --> 37:06.817
and you feel
like the whole world

37:06.917 --> 37:07.859
is out to get you.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.400
But you know what?

37:09.500 --> 37:12.483
Your mom and dad didn't split up
to hurt you.

37:12.583 --> 37:16.151
Things just happen--
things that you

37:16.251 --> 37:18.109
may never understand,

37:18.209 --> 37:21.442
but you just have to believe
that it's for the best,

37:21.542 --> 37:25.042
even if it doesn't
always seem that way.

37:27.376 --> 37:31.334
You remember how sad you were
when your daddy left?

37:32.334 --> 37:35.399
Well, that's how sad
everybody's going to be

37:35.499 --> 37:37.499
if you don't come home.

37:57.499 --> 37:59.709
Nicely done.

38:09.667 --> 38:10.734
Ow.

38:10.834 --> 38:11.817
Yep.

38:11.917 --> 38:13.151
Ice?

38:13.251 --> 38:14.399
Bed.

38:14.499 --> 38:17.499
(<i>doorbell rings</i>)

38:24.834 --> 38:27.750
Who delivers at this hour?

38:32.959 --> 38:35.399
I think that this
is someone's way

38:35.499 --> 38:37.399
of saying thank you.

38:37.499 --> 38:38.817
Oh... here.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.692
(<i>chuckling</i>)

38:40.792 --> 38:44.067
Well, you're welcome.

38:44.167 --> 38:46.459
Oh, they're so pretty.

38:54.001 --> 38:57.334
Piper, uh, we...

38:58.292 --> 38:59.901
We, um...

39:00.001 --> 39:01.942
we just...
I know.

39:02.042 --> 39:03.399
PIPER:
It's okay.

39:03.499 --> 39:05.109
I'm actually
beginning to understand

39:05.209 --> 39:08.026
why they don't want witches
and whitelighters

39:08.126 --> 39:09.583
to be together.

39:13.917 --> 39:19.442
Marriage is, um, hard enough,
you know?

39:19.542 --> 39:25.399
But marriage
to a whitelighter...

39:25.499 --> 39:29.234
He's got to orb out
at all times of the night,

39:29.334 --> 39:33.167
and sometimes he's gone
for weeks at a time.

39:33.834 --> 39:37.400
But honestly, if I'm going
to have a meltdown

39:37.500 --> 39:40.483
every time I have no idea
where he is...

39:40.583 --> 39:44.399
then none of us are going
to be able to do our jobs.

39:44.499 --> 39:45.399
And if we had lost

39:45.499 --> 39:48.026
that little girl tonight...

39:48.126 --> 39:50.109
But we didn't.

39:50.209 --> 39:52.959
But we could have.

39:53.792 --> 39:58.499
I don't think
I could live with that.

39:59.084 --> 40:04.859
If that means
that I have to give up Leo...

40:04.959 --> 40:09.875
then I guess that's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make.

40:30.209 --> 40:32.318
Am I dreaming?

40:32.418 --> 40:34.499
No.

40:37.709 --> 40:42.126
I had a dream
that you weren't coming back.

40:45.750 --> 40:48.318
That wasn't a dream either,
was it?

40:48.418 --> 40:50.500
No, it wasn't.

40:51.209 --> 40:54.318
They had forbidden me
from ever seeing you again.

40:54.418 --> 40:56.817
LEO:
But now, I...

40:56.917 --> 40:59.399
I don't know
what you said or did,

40:59.499 --> 41:02.483
but they said
you show great courage

41:02.583 --> 41:03.399
and great faith.

41:03.499 --> 41:05.026
Enough to make them
reconsider.

41:05.126 --> 41:09.318
PHOEBE:
Does that mean you guys
could get married now?

41:09.418 --> 41:12.026
Oh...!
What? I want to know.

41:12.126 --> 41:14.399
Uh, not yet.

41:14.499 --> 41:15.359
It means they're giving us

41:15.459 --> 41:17.276
a chance to prove
we can make it work.

41:17.376 --> 41:18.650
PHOEBE:
What do you mean,

41:18.750 --> 41:20.167
like probation?

41:20.583 --> 41:22.276
LEO:
Well, if we
can show them

41:22.376 --> 41:23.067
that our relationship

41:23.167 --> 41:25.442
won't get in the way
of our work...

41:25.542 --> 41:26.859
Then we can stay together.

41:26.959 --> 41:28.734
Right,
but if anything goes wrong--

41:28.834 --> 41:30.399
if we're distracted
by each other

41:30.499 --> 41:32.901
to the detriment
of a single innocent...

41:33.001 --> 41:35.459
We won't be.

41:45.625 --> 41:47.399
Are you worried?

41:47.499 --> 41:49.399
When are you going to learn?

41:49.499 --> 41:50.399
I'm always worried.

41:50.499 --> 41:52.609
I'm relieved that
he's back, though.

41:52.709 --> 41:54.734
I mean,
not only for Piper, but...

41:54.834 --> 41:55.359
I know.

41:55.459 --> 41:57.775
Unknown, unattractive demon
on the loose.

41:57.875 --> 41:59.734
Yeah, let's not tell them
till tomorrow.

41:59.834 --> 42:00.984
I think that
the least

42:01.084 --> 42:02.483
that they deserve is one night

42:02.583 --> 42:04.567
of worry-free romance,
don't you?

42:04.667 --> 42:07.109
Mmm... romance...

42:07.209 --> 42:08.775
(<i>groaning</i>)

42:08.875 --> 42:10.234

42:15.292 --> 42:16.400
(<i>gasping</i>)

42:16.500 --> 42:17.399
Uh, hi, Cole.

42:17.499 --> 42:20.318
What are you, what are you doing
in the office

42:20.418 --> 42:21.483
at, uh, 2:00 in the morning?

42:21.583 --> 42:23.442
What are you doing
calling my office

42:23.542 --> 42:24.442
at 2:00 in the morning?

42:24.542 --> 42:28.859
Um, I-I was just going
to leave you a message.

42:28.959 --> 42:31.442
Save you the trouble
of having to talk to me.

42:31.542 --> 42:34.399
Why would I ever
not want to talk to you?

42:34.499 --> 42:35.817
I-I-I don't know, you know,

42:35.917 --> 42:38.609
just in case you thought
I was a drunk

42:38.709 --> 42:41.026
or a lunatic,
or a drunk lunatic.

42:41.126 --> 42:42.859
I think I'm going
to go with mystery--

42:42.959 --> 42:44.525
one I'm looking forward
to figuring out.

42:44.625 --> 42:52.734
Okay. Um, I'm going to go then,
and uh, be mysterious.

42:52.834 --> 42:54.650
I'll call you.

42:54.750 --> 42:56.817
I will answer.

(<i>line clicks</i>)

42:58.542 --> 43:01.084
(<i>keypad beeps</i>)

43:01.834 --> 43:07.459
Yes. Tell them
I'm getting closer.
