WEBVTT

00:40.908 --> 00:41.958
How much did we get ?

00:42.557 --> 00:44.664
It's gonna be what...
20 grand.

00:46.215 --> 00:47.605
We must get rid of the car.

00:48.011 --> 00:50.274
- Do you think anybody saw us ?
- It doesn't matter.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.600
As soon as we get
to the Keys, we're ghost.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.363
- Leo.
- They're kidding me !

01:01.489 --> 01:03.439
The drawbridge is already halfway out.

01:03.573 --> 01:04.473
We're trapped.

01:06.163 --> 01:07.513
Ain't going down for this.

01:07.857 --> 01:09.057
Come on. Bring the bag.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.742
Hold it right there !

01:31.210 --> 01:32.363
Do not move !

01:43.033 --> 01:44.187
Put the bag down,

01:44.626 --> 01:45.526
now !

01:47.827 --> 01:48.727
Do what he says.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.974
- Don't make me shoot you !
- Sienna !

02:05.685 --> 02:06.662
I love you, Leo.

02:35.109 --> 02:36.338
Oh, my God.

02:36.901 --> 02:39.991
We've got to get Homicide out here. Someone make a call, quick !

02:54.004 --> 02:55.104
Thank you, gentlemen.

02:59.366 --> 03:00.716
Beats pennies from heaven.

03:04.240 --> 03:06.011
Drawbridge gave us a twofer, Horatio.

03:06.137 --> 03:09.810
Yes. We've got one case closed
and one presenting itself.

03:11.373 --> 03:13.873
Looks like an exit wound
at the back of his head.

03:16.035 --> 03:17.835
One shot was a through-and-through.

03:17.983 --> 03:19.784
Whoa. Shot through the eyes ?

03:20.456 --> 03:21.838
That's a hell of a way to go.

03:21.964 --> 03:23.714
There'no bruising around his neck.

03:24.980 --> 03:27.718
This baby boy was dead
before he played hangman.

03:28.345 --> 03:31.456
Okay, so blood does not
travel sideways, does it ?

03:31.727 --> 03:34.317
That means he was dry
before they strung him up.

03:34.443 --> 03:35.743
So he wasn't killed here.

03:36.332 --> 03:38.802
- This is our secondary crime scene.
- It was staged.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.921
- This is a message.
- Got that right.

03:42.379 --> 03:43.679
Card in his pocket.

03:44.793 --> 03:45.693
The joker.

03:45.933 --> 03:47.483
Message taken, loud and clear.

03:48.184 --> 03:49.718
Looks like a mob hit, Horatio.

03:49.844 --> 03:52.608
Yes. And it's time
to hit back.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
CSI Miami 4x14

04:58.038 --> 04:58.938
He's all yours.

05:02.481 --> 05:05.083
Mr Wolfe.
What do we have ?

05:05.576 --> 05:07.039
Well, this isn't standard rope.

05:07.165 --> 05:08.065
Check it out.

05:08.967 --> 05:10.298
It's not rope at all, is it ?

05:11.476 --> 05:13.129
Looks like it came off a stanchion.

05:13.255 --> 05:15.430
Yes. Not your average murder prop.

05:16.477 --> 05:17.627
Weapon of opportunity ?

05:17.816 --> 05:19.666
This could be a part of the message.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.740
Got an ID on our Joker :

05:21.916 --> 05:22.816
Jake Richmond.

05:23.178 --> 05:25.215
- Organized crime, Frank ?
- He could.

05:25.341 --> 05:28.712
Made guys like to hang in clubs. And he
ran five of the hottest in Miami Beach.

05:28.838 --> 05:31.145
He a real up-and-comer, isn't he ?

05:31.305 --> 05:33.883
Noose probably came off a stanchion
in front of one of his clubs.

05:34.309 --> 05:36.374
Proverbial velvet rope, isn't it ?

05:36.610 --> 05:40.010
Tie a knot this tight, probably
slough off a lot of skin cells.

05:40.222 --> 05:42.597
- Take it to DNA.
- Thank you, Mr. Wolfe.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.574
They go where the money is,
don't they ?

05:46.700 --> 05:49.200
Talk too much,
you get the Colombian Necktie.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.999
- See too much...
- You never see again.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.632
Let's find out who was
interested in Mr. Richmond.

06:00.608 --> 06:01.708
Calleigh.

06:02.475 --> 06:04.475
You here for the drawbridge victim ?

06:05.144 --> 06:06.744
So are these the nine-mils ?

06:10.307 --> 06:13.246
- You only have one.
- Dug it out of his skull.

06:13.917 --> 06:16.017
Other shot was a through-and-through.

06:19.571 --> 06:21.394
The other one
may still be at the scene.

06:21.520 --> 06:23.670
Just have to figure out where that is.

06:24.465 --> 06:26.213
Hey, Alexx, do you see what I see ?

06:26.339 --> 06:27.439
It's on his lips.

06:30.953 --> 06:32.503
More where that came from.

06:32.737 --> 06:35.039
- What do you think it is ?
- No idea.

06:36.648 --> 06:38.148
I'll send it to Trace.

06:44.554 --> 06:45.577
Calleigh, you seen Wolfe ?

06:46.003 --> 06:49.053
Not yet. He's supposed to be
headed back with the noose.

06:49.582 --> 06:51.688
Ah, here we go.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.000
- IBIS found a match.
- Most certainly did.

06:55.126 --> 06:59.276
A bullet with identical striations was
recovered in a homicide case last year.

07:00.090 --> 07:02.106
No surprise : it's mob-related.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.272
I'd say so.

07:04.711 --> 07:07.788
Ties back to Joey Salucci,
biggest mob boss in Miami.

07:09.386 --> 07:11.445
No attorney, Mr. Salucci.

07:12.345 --> 07:13.709
That's surprising

07:14.515 --> 07:16.215
for a man of your reputation.

07:16.708 --> 07:18.408
Why would I need an attorney ?

07:18.936 --> 07:20.736
Those suits give me a headache.

07:21.163 --> 07:22.876
I like doing things hands-on.

07:23.002 --> 07:26.658
The bullet that I extracted
from Jake Richmond's head

07:27.283 --> 07:29.433
tells me that you're involved in this.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.046
I didn't have anything
to do with any murder.

07:32.172 --> 07:34.100
Last year, Joseph, a man

07:34.226 --> 07:38.214
who had attempted to turn State's
evidence against you was shot to death.

07:38.452 --> 07:40.452
Gun used to off him was a nine-mil.

07:40.617 --> 07:42.867
Six lands and grooves,
right-hand twist.

07:43.335 --> 07:46.618
Not too many manufacturers with
those rifling characteristics, Salucci.

07:46.744 --> 07:47.844
Yeah, you know...

07:48.649 --> 07:49.716
I read about that.

07:49.842 --> 07:53.156
But if I remember correctly,
they never found that gun.

07:53.402 --> 07:55.101
Mob works in
mysterious ways, doesn't it ?

07:55.227 --> 07:56.327
Mob  ?

07:58.570 --> 08:00.176
I'm in real estate.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.079
But you went into
the club business, Joseph,

08:02.205 --> 08:04.741
which is what brought you down here
from Atlantic City, isn't it ?

08:04.867 --> 08:06.124
The FBI tell you that ?

08:06.250 --> 08:09.050
Guy was shot in the eyes
and strung up over the city

08:09.176 --> 08:11.677
with  a Joker playing card
shoved in his pocket.

08:13.086 --> 08:15.142
That's very theatrical.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.901
But from what I heard,
in the old days,

08:19.876 --> 08:23.826
when they wanted somebody done,
they didn't have to dress it up like that.

08:25.807 --> 08:27.007
But what do I know ?

08:28.757 --> 08:30.257
Anything else, gentlemen ?

08:30.428 --> 08:32.636
If I find your DNA
on that hanging rope,

08:32.763 --> 08:36.313
the only real estate you'll be
dealing with is a six-by-nine cell.

08:42.191 --> 08:43.291
Don't go far.

08:57.035 --> 09:00.672
So this is the Burgundy Club,
our hanging man's base of operations.

09:01.047 --> 09:03.183
Yeah. Same color as our velvet rope.

09:03.691 --> 09:05.041
It's missing one link.

09:07.341 --> 09:09.291
I think we found our murder scene.

09:12.233 --> 09:15.673
I completely agree.
I've got two nine-mil casings.

09:16.224 --> 09:18.224
Same as what we found
in the guy's skull.

09:20.094 --> 09:23.313
The other shot was a through-and-through. If he'd been hit here,

09:23.439 --> 09:25.189
there'd be all kinds of blood.

09:25.926 --> 09:27.026
Do you see any ?

09:28.621 --> 09:29.721
No.

09:30.954 --> 09:33.031
No, but I do see tread marks.

09:33.439 --> 09:34.889
Someone left in a hurry.

09:35.322 --> 09:37.022
Must have been shot in the car.

09:37.917 --> 09:40.066
Car could have absorbed
all the blood and the bullet.

09:40.192 --> 09:43.692
Which means that a portion of our
primary crime scene drove away.

09:43.819 --> 09:45.319
Car could be anywhere by now.

09:48.742 --> 09:51.242
I didn't think they were
open during the day.

09:51.839 --> 09:53.189
No. I'll check it out.

10:12.152 --> 10:14.230
Hey, man, we don't open
till 8:00, bro.

10:14.356 --> 10:16.214
Eric Delko, Miami-Dade PD.

10:16.579 --> 10:19.229
I'm investigating
Jake Richmond's murder. "Bro."

10:20.385 --> 10:22.135
Hey, beat it. Let's go. Girls.

10:22.628 --> 10:23.728
Cut the music.

10:25.001 --> 10:27.374
Yeah, I heard about it. Sucks.

10:27.829 --> 10:28.929
And you are ?

10:29.659 --> 10:31.481
Cesar Morales.
They call me "Cuzz."

10:31.607 --> 10:32.683
You work here, Cuzz ?

10:32.800 --> 10:33.572
That's why they call me Cuzz.

10:33.690 --> 10:34.883
I work at the door.

10:35.003 --> 10:37.057
People want in,
suddenly I'm family.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.621
When was the last time
you saw Jake alive ?

10:40.751 --> 10:43.716
This morning. It was like...
7:00 A.M., you know ?

10:43.842 --> 10:46.046
We did our ritual.
I booked.

10:46.172 --> 10:47.195
What ritual ?

10:47.321 --> 10:48.768
Well, the club closes early morning,

10:48.894 --> 10:50.441
me and Jake, we go up to the loft.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.671
You know, he counts his take
over a cigar and a fifth of Jack.

10:53.797 --> 10:56.435
- And he does that every day ?
- Oh, I should know.

10:57.572 --> 10:59.249
I couldn't leave unless I lit him up,

10:59.375 --> 11:00.340
and tested his drink.

11:00.466 --> 11:02.016
Tested his drink for what ?

11:02.603 --> 11:03.849
Name your poison.

11:04.062 --> 11:05.412
The dude was paranoid.

11:05.787 --> 11:08.537
- Well, who didn't he trust ?
- Joey Salucci.

11:08.952 --> 11:10.625
- You know him ?
- We do.

11:10.751 --> 11:13.736
Because when he wants you gotten to,
you are got.

11:15.288 --> 11:16.744
Calleigh, meet Cuzz.

11:17.402 --> 11:19.510
He just got a sudden promotion.

11:20.428 --> 11:23.178
Oh. Well, then maybe
you can tell me what this is.

11:26.611 --> 11:27.761
Yeah, it beats me.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.697
I found it in the parking lot.
It has blood spatter all over it.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.423
And you were the last person
to see Jake alive.

11:33.774 --> 11:34.874
Look, man...

11:35.163 --> 11:36.698
your guess is as good as mine.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.147
I wish I could help you.

11:38.273 --> 11:40.173
I tell you what. Anything else...

11:44.125 --> 11:45.235
here's my digits.

11:46.190 --> 11:47.590
Ohhey, girls, let's go !

11:53.395 --> 11:54.746
Valera did we get anything ?

11:54.872 --> 11:57.017
On the playing card ? No,
it was clean.

11:57.143 --> 11:59.674
I'm actually more interested
in the DNA from the rope.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.853
All due respect, sir, I just got it.
Nathan Biggs dropped it off.

12:02.979 --> 12:04.003
I'm sorry.

12:04.129 --> 12:05.316
Nathan Biggs ?

12:05.441 --> 12:08.592
- Mr. Wolfe didn't drop it off ?
- No, sir, it was a trainee.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.793
Uh, could I get that
as soon as possible, please ?

12:13.919 --> 12:15.769
- Yes, Sir.
- Thank you, Ma'am.

12:21.154 --> 12:21.904
Mr. Wolfe,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.030
got a minute ?

12:27.034 --> 12:28.818
I was actually going
to come and find you.

12:28.944 --> 12:30.548
Yeah. I understand, um.

12:31.277 --> 12:34.227
I understand that a trainee
dropped off your evidence.

12:34.440 --> 12:35.553
Yeah. I, um,

12:35.679 --> 12:38.772
I actually got in a little bit of a car
accident on the way back to the lab.

12:38.898 --> 12:41.070
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Totally fine.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.080
I was stuck there ; I couldn't leave,

12:44.206 --> 12:45.406
so I called Nathan.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.323
Why didn't you call the team ?

12:48.159 --> 12:50.009
I figured everyone's hands were full.

12:50.135 --> 12:53.146
But, H., don't worry,
the chain of custody's tight.

12:53.284 --> 12:54.553
Mr.  Wolfe, I'm...

12:55.123 --> 12:57.123
I'm not worried about the evidence.

12:58.048 --> 12:59.212
Oh, right, my eye.

13:01.495 --> 13:02.670
H., this woman...

13:03.140 --> 13:04.623
- she came out of nowhere.
- Mr. Wolfe...

13:04.749 --> 13:06.699
have you had your eye checked yet ?

13:08.717 --> 13:09.817
No,  sir, not yet.

13:13.499 --> 13:14.910
I'm busy with the case.

13:16.325 --> 13:18.025
I think it's time to do that.

13:19.773 --> 13:22.247
- All right.
- Thank you.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.277
Cynthia, please tell me
you got something on this paper.

13:37.403 --> 13:38.435
Certainly did.

13:38.561 --> 13:42.456
Got the DNA section that confirmed
the blood on it belonged to the victim.

13:42.582 --> 13:43.560
Okay, and what is it ?

13:43.686 --> 13:47.521
It's a reporting form, which uses
imaging technology to collect data.

13:47.902 --> 13:51.052
The sheet feeds into the readers
and extrapolate the data.

13:53.444 --> 13:55.620
And these marks on the side
under "field code."

13:55.746 --> 13:58.004
- That significant ?
- Mm-hmm, sure is.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.779
All of the company's clients
are assigned a unique number.

14:00.905 --> 14:03.098
That way, once the forms are processed,

14:03.224 --> 14:05.524
the results can be
reported back to them.

14:06.075 --> 14:07.137
And this one ?

14:07.263 --> 14:12.008
Registered to Dade University,
class called "FS 320."

14:12.206 --> 14:15.616
Okay, so this form doesn't tie back
to the club, or to the Mob.

14:15.838 --> 14:17.631
What does "FS" stand for ?

14:18.935 --> 14:19.966
I don't know.

14:20.092 --> 14:23.092
But whatever it is, that class
is about to get canceled.

14:26.882 --> 14:30.055
So, FS 320, that's a
junior film studies course ?

14:30.181 --> 14:32.992
Yeah. Screenwriting.
Imagine that ?

14:33.118 --> 14:35.019
Watch movies, you get a degree.

14:35.781 --> 14:39.931
Meanwhile, I was studying for my quantum
mechanics and neurophysiology finals.

14:40.071 --> 14:41.321
What was I thinking ?

14:43.505 --> 14:46.848
- So we know what this guy looks like ?
- He supposed to meet us down here.

14:46.974 --> 14:48.674
- Maybe this is him.
- Yeah.

14:49.134 --> 14:52.483
- By chance... you Mr. Meyers ?
- "Professor."

14:53.126 --> 14:54.261
How can I help you ?

14:54.387 --> 14:56.237
Like to ask you a few questions.

14:57.641 --> 15:00.691
- Does this look familiar ?
- Well, sure, that's a test answer sheet.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.367
We use them at the school.

15:03.186 --> 15:05.096
- What's that on it ?
- It's blood ;

15:05.222 --> 15:06.979
we found it at the scene of a homicide.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.205
A homicide ?

15:08.633 --> 15:10.587
And the form ties back
to your class, Professor.

15:10.713 --> 15:13.814
And it's blank,
so it doesn't belong to a student.

15:14.145 --> 15:15.226
Where do you keep them ?

15:15.352 --> 15:18.575
I just got a new batch the other day. They're in the trunk of my car.

15:18.701 --> 15:20.201
May we look at your car, please ?

15:27.386 --> 15:28.486
Oh, my God.

15:29.863 --> 15:30.963
What is that ?

15:31.584 --> 15:33.320
Somebody must have stolen my car.

15:33.446 --> 15:36.048
Well, the car is coming
with us, Professor.

15:38.425 --> 15:39.525
And so are you.

15:52.282 --> 15:55.048
- What'd you find ?
- Nine-millimeter round.

15:55.548 --> 15:57.285
Looks like it's got
some brain matter on it.

15:57.411 --> 15:59.211
That's the through-and-through.

15:59.807 --> 16:01.507
Jake Richmond was killed in this trunk.

16:05.220 --> 16:08.120
And a test form fell
out of the trunk in the process.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.076
So, you believe the professor.

16:14.202 --> 16:17.615
That someone stole his car and then
ever-so-kindly put it back ?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.612
Anything's possible. A whole lot of
people had access to his car keys.

16:21.738 --> 16:24.008
He did say that he left them
in his desk drawer.

16:24.694 --> 16:27.244
I guess we can print the whole car,
see if we get lucky.

16:28.693 --> 16:30.193
Well, we may not have to.

16:31.475 --> 16:33.193
This doesn't seem to belong in here.

16:33.319 --> 16:36.948
It's an ear bud cover from a set of headphones. Maybe there's some earwax on it.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.614
And the professor seems more 8-track
than iPod to me, don't you think ?

16:44.813 --> 16:46.363
That  noose was a pain in the neck.

16:48.697 --> 16:49.733
Sorry.

16:49.859 --> 16:51.509
But I found someone for you.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.266
Found a literal buffet of epithelials.

16:54.392 --> 16:56.242
That many off a casual transfer ?

16:57.007 --> 16:58.607
This guy was up close and personal.

17:02.419 --> 17:04.692
So you say he was male.
Do we get a CODIS match ?

17:04.818 --> 17:05.660
Take a look.

17:08.998 --> 17:10.377
Norman Stein.

17:10.627 --> 17:12.916
In the system for attempted rape
charged last year.

17:13.343 --> 17:15.946
Well, welcome to strike two,
Norman. Thank you.

17:17.472 --> 17:18.944
I'm a movie producer.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.689
I glorify violence.
I don't engage in it.

17:21.815 --> 17:24.854
Yes, I think you're referring to
the attempted rape from last year ?

17:24.980 --> 17:26.039
That was bogus.

17:26.165 --> 17:28.385
I tapped some actress,
then didn't give her a part.

17:28.511 --> 17:30.745
If the movie was a go,
she would've been my girlfriend.

17:30.871 --> 17:32.104
We recovered your

17:32.230 --> 17:36.301
skin cells from the velvet rope
that was used to hang Jake Richmond.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.796
I didn't even know Jake was dead.

17:38.922 --> 17:41.122
You can't explain away your DNA, Stein.

17:41.901 --> 17:43.210
You ever been in The Burgundy Club ?

17:43.336 --> 17:46.532
Yes, actually, and, in fact, there was
an incident there just the other night.

17:46.658 --> 17:47.402
An incident ?

17:47.528 --> 17:50.297
Yeah. I went to see
one of Jake's boys, Cuzz Morales.

17:50.423 --> 17:52.048
- Hey, hey, Cuzz.
- Hey, yo, Stein,

17:52.146 --> 17:54.532
- I can't let you in, man, capacity.
- Hear me out.

17:54.658 --> 17:55.908
I got a new project.

17:56.157 --> 17:58.688
I need you to help out a couple of my
writers, give 'em a taste of the scene.

17:58.814 --> 18:00.957
Like I got time to baby-sit
a couple of freaks.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.733
I used to tip you 500 bucks !

18:05.101 --> 18:06.232
You used to !

18:08.612 --> 18:10.302
That's how my hands got on the rope.

18:12.419 --> 18:15.224
We're familiar with him.
What'd you want with Cuzz ?

18:15.350 --> 18:17.269
I'm paying a couple
of college kids a half a mill

18:17.395 --> 18:20.507
to turn their story about the
South Beach club world into a script.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.020
As soon as I read
the first couple pages,

18:22.146 --> 18:25.246
I could see these guys had
never even been inside a club.

18:27.063 --> 18:28.663
Do this, I'll give you 25%.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.433
Of the gross.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.235
It's why I'm a great producer.

18:33.361 --> 18:37.101
I take a little elbow grease, turn a hunk
of coal into a whole lot of diamonds.

18:38.872 --> 18:41.966
- The Clubland Murders.
- Yeah, it's cool, huh.

18:42.092 --> 18:43.878
All you need to sell
a movie is a killer poster.

18:44.004 --> 18:45.804
That's an exact replica of our murder.

18:46.453 --> 18:48.946
You can't buy this kind
of publicity, can you ?

18:49.072 --> 18:52.744
It wasn't my idea.
Talk to the writers !

18:55.063 --> 18:57.163
No. No, no, no.
Make him a black guy.

18:57.411 --> 18:59.461
Opens up a whole other demo
for opening night.

19:00.374 --> 19:02.526
So he's the one that says
"Today's a good day to die" ?

19:03.447 --> 19:06.307
And make sure you put
"with intensity", so the actor knows.

19:06.778 --> 19:08.278
Sounds like a rental to me.

19:08.771 --> 19:12.071
- Patrick Wilder ? Ben Williams ?
- Yeah, that's us.

19:12.943 --> 19:14.406
We saw your poster for your movie.

19:14.532 --> 19:17.208
It just so happens it depicts
a murder that occurred this morning.

19:17.334 --> 19:18.165
What ?

19:18.291 --> 19:21.120
No one's even seen that poster.
How could somebody copy us ?

19:21.246 --> 19:22.825
Maybe a better question is

19:23.491 --> 19:25.041
did you commit the murder ?

19:26.391 --> 19:27.843
No. No way.

19:33.153 --> 19:36.724
Well, we found one of these ear bud covers
in the trunk of your professor's car.

19:37.150 --> 19:39.510
You steal his ride ?
Try to frame him ?

19:41.259 --> 19:44.085
I've helped him carry scripts to his
car before. Maybe it fell out then.

19:44.211 --> 19:46.111
You're circling the drain, sport.

19:46.391 --> 19:49.174
Son, you got something gnawing on your
conscience, you better cough it up.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.473
Some dude died like our character ?

19:53.430 --> 19:54.530
That's freaky.

19:55.116 --> 19:56.416
What's your script's about ?

19:58.232 --> 19:59.318
It's going to rock. It's...

19:59.444 --> 20:02.364
It's like The Godfather,
with a little Mean Streets,

20:02.490 --> 20:03.869
and a Goodfellas vibe.

20:04.634 --> 20:05.734
It's original.

20:06.617 --> 20:07.702
It will be.

20:07.828 --> 20:09.496
This idea just came to you ?

20:09.622 --> 20:11.072
Sort  of like a daydream ?

20:13.148 --> 20:13.998
Tell him, Patrick.

20:17.774 --> 20:19.304
Professor Meyer thought of it.

20:19.709 --> 20:21.059
The screenwriting professor.

20:21.495 --> 20:24.945
You know, we didn't even like his idea.
It was completely unrealistic.

20:25.586 --> 20:28.124
But we needed product.
I guess he came through for us.

20:28.450 --> 20:31.383
Guess what, Tarantino.
Earwax contains DNA.

20:32.771 --> 20:34.001
We can verify it's yours.

20:36.074 --> 20:38.309
You want to
give us a copy of the script ?

20:38.972 --> 20:40.902
We're only up to page 40.

20:41.979 --> 20:43.379
Meyer's got it, anyway.

20:43.637 --> 20:45.793
We had a little, uh,
writer's block.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.696
Professor Meyer says
he knows what will sell.

20:49.513 --> 20:50.813
He already sold us a story.

20:51.370 --> 20:53.900
And I have the feeling
it's about to be rewritten.

21:03.745 --> 21:05.845
You came to see me
just in time, Mr. Wolfe.

21:06.717 --> 21:09.889
Eye's bloodshot,
some inflammation.

21:10.765 --> 21:12.315
Were you prescribed an antibiotic ?

21:13.086 --> 21:14.512
Yeah, I took every single pill.

21:15.270 --> 21:17.070
Well, your medical file says the nail

21:17.600 --> 21:19.764
bypassed your sinus cavity and brain,

21:20.733 --> 21:22.619
and was removed without complications.

21:22.745 --> 21:25.045
Unless you call
double vision a complication.

21:25.516 --> 21:27.066
Well, have you experienced any pain ?

21:30.591 --> 21:31.491
Some.

21:32.819 --> 21:34.519
But I'm a bit of a hypochondriac.

21:34.807 --> 21:36.307
Yeah, well, not in this case.

21:36.986 --> 21:37.886
See, the nail

21:38.142 --> 21:41.542
may have caused an infection
which the antibiotic didn't eradicate.

21:44.653 --> 21:45.553
Is it bad ?

21:46.180 --> 21:49.430
Well, you could be experiencing
the onset of orbital cellulitis.

21:50.314 --> 21:52.895
It's an infection
of the tissue behind your eye.

21:54.656 --> 21:55.606
How is it treated ?

21:55.886 --> 21:59.060
I'll put you on a different
oral antibiotic-- cephalexin.

22:00.469 --> 22:02.119
I just hope we've caught it in time.

22:03.817 --> 22:05.254
That means I shouldn't be working.

22:05.455 --> 22:07.893
That's the last thing
you should be thinking about.

22:08.019 --> 22:11.719
Now, we get a jump on this, and we
won't have to rely on the last resort.

22:11.985 --> 22:12.885
Which is ?

22:13.985 --> 22:14.885
Surgery.

22:15.914 --> 22:18.514
Now, should those methods fail,
I have to tell you,

22:19.416 --> 22:20.766
you could lose your sight.

22:24.608 --> 22:26.058
I'll go and get your prescription.

22:45.401 --> 22:46.502
Yes, it's true.

22:47.305 --> 22:48.879
The kids needed a movie idea.

22:49.267 --> 22:52.633
- I decided to help them.
- Purely out of charity, I'm sure.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.039
I admit,

22:54.379 --> 22:56.029
I'm living a little vicariously.

22:56.662 --> 22:58.462
I tried to play the Hollywood game.

22:59.066 --> 22:59.966
Didn't work out.

23:00.753 --> 23:03.103
Lucky for them,
style is the new substance.

23:05.133 --> 23:06.742
Professor, how do you feel
about the fact

23:06.868 --> 23:09.208
that they're about to make
a half a million dollars

23:09.787 --> 23:11.899
off a story that you created ?

23:13.653 --> 23:16.303
Well, they promised me
an associate producer credit.

23:16.603 --> 23:18.069
It'll get me in the game.

23:18.095 --> 23:22.377
Sounds to me like this is a very important
opportunity for you, and perhaps...

23:23.920 --> 23:25.247
perhaps your last hope.

23:27.984 --> 23:29.394
Well, now you're just being cruel.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.949
I understand that they believe your writing
is not realistic, and my question is,

23:34.186 --> 23:36.669
did you kill Jake Richmond
to prove them wrong ?

23:38.624 --> 23:39.735
That's crazy.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.789
And I only gave them
the general plot, nothing specific.

23:44.481 --> 23:45.931
Nothing specific.
Thank you.

23:48.535 --> 23:49.435
Let's see.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.080
Gave them...

23:53.779 --> 23:54.912
"Kill club owner!"

23:55.895 --> 23:57.094
"Shoot through eyes."

23:59.082 --> 23:59.983
"Hanging."

24:04.070 --> 24:04.970
The Joker.

24:06.747 --> 24:07.782
"Looks like mob."

24:10.279 --> 24:13.129
Professor, from where I'm sitting,
that's very specific.

24:14.071 --> 24:15.696
That came to me that way.

24:16.214 --> 24:18.764
They got notes, asked me
to help incorporate them.

24:19.598 --> 24:22.343
- That's not my writing.
- Well, whose writing is it ?

24:22.469 --> 24:25.716
- You have to believe me. I don't know.
- I want to believe you.

24:25.842 --> 24:27.392
You're the associate producer.

24:34.943 --> 24:36.793
See you're doing some light reading.

24:37.368 --> 24:38.268
Man, is it.

24:38.535 --> 24:41.035
These writers never met
a cliché they didn't use.

24:41.690 --> 24:43.640
So, what are the first
40 pages about ?

24:44.233 --> 24:47.968
A kid gets a job at a restaurant
washing dishes. Um,

24:48.215 --> 24:51.965
he insults some big mob boss, who then
decides to take him under his wing.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.349
Is that it ?

24:53.479 --> 24:55.879
Life's too short.
I'm gonna spare you the rest.

24:56.572 --> 24:58.765
So, what do you think ?
Is the professor telling the truth ?

24:58.891 --> 25:00.391
Horatio got a writing sample.

25:01.116 --> 25:02.236
QD eliminated him.

25:02.888 --> 25:06.438
Then who wrote the instructions on who
and how to kill in the script margin ?

25:07.052 --> 25:09.130
Well, I was about to get some samples

25:09.256 --> 25:11.462
from the writers and see
if we can rule them out.

25:11.588 --> 25:12.788
Then I remembered this.

25:14.517 --> 25:16.484
Cuzz Morales.
Jake's boy.

25:18.293 --> 25:19.193
Here's my digits.

25:24.611 --> 25:25.961
The handwriting's a match.

25:27.793 --> 25:28.725
So,

25:29.214 --> 25:32.437
you are the technical advisor
for Ben and Patrick's movie.

25:33.572 --> 25:34.834
I got a lot of talents.

25:35.338 --> 25:36.769
You wrote notes in their script.

25:36.895 --> 25:37.961
"Kill club owner,"

25:38.334 --> 25:40.234
"Shoot through the eyes,"
and "Hang."

25:40.742 --> 25:42.616
Yeah, so what ?
It blew big chunks, man.

25:42.742 --> 25:44.051
They brought me in to keep it real.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.177
This is about as real as it gets, Cuzz.

25:47.083 --> 25:49.122
Killing Jake Richmond
gets you the club,

25:49.248 --> 25:51.098
some cred with your old pal Salucci,

25:51.572 --> 25:53.227
and a tale fit for a Hollywood movie.

25:53.353 --> 25:54.703
No way, man. I loved Jake.

25:56.289 --> 25:57.788
What are you looking for
anyway, man ?

25:57.914 --> 25:58.814
Read the warrant.

26:02.115 --> 26:04.015
We did some checking on you, Morales.

26:04.222 --> 26:08.060
Gun used to kill Jake
ties back to a Joey Salucci hit.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.606
Yes, during the time
that you worked for him.

26:10.732 --> 26:11.883
I was a gofer, man.

26:12.439 --> 26:14.118
Well,
in that case...

26:18.116 --> 26:19.916
should've buried that in your hole.

26:20.196 --> 26:21.096
Nine-mil.

26:21.559 --> 26:22.959
Filed under "S" for stupid.

26:23.999 --> 26:24.888
How'd that get there ?

26:25.014 --> 26:28.014
If it turns out to be Mr. Salucci's
gun, you're going down.

26:32.451 --> 26:36.401
The tox results came back. It turns out
our victim had the drug GHB in his system.

26:36.784 --> 26:37.991
You don't say.

26:38.643 --> 26:42.425
And I ran the brown flake in his teeth.
They were tobacco leaves from the cigar.

26:42.551 --> 26:43.926
They were saturated with the stuff.

26:44.052 --> 26:47.694
So Jake's cigar was dosed
by a close friend.

26:48.714 --> 26:49.764
Thank you, Calleigh.

26:51.932 --> 26:54.617
- I want a lawyer.
- Yes, I would imagine.

27:41.145 --> 27:42.469
- Any news ?
- Best kind.

27:42.950 --> 27:45.279
The gun we found at the club
killed Jake Richmond, and

27:45.405 --> 27:47.013
the guy in the old Salucci case.

27:47.139 --> 27:49.189
Wow. I wish my news was as good.

27:49.546 --> 27:50.446
What is it ?

27:50.608 --> 27:53.789
Well, there was only one print on the
gun, and it doesn't belong to Cuzz.

27:53.915 --> 27:55.865
- And there's no match in AFIS ?
- No.

27:56.090 --> 28:00.076
And the mystery print was in a weird place,
too. It was on the top of the barrel.

28:00.202 --> 28:01.993
So, there's no way
to tie Cuzz to the murder.

28:02.119 --> 28:05.784
No, and his attorney's already working
on getting him released from custody.

28:05.910 --> 28:08.067
So far, all of our suspects have motive

28:08.797 --> 28:10.156
- and something to gain.
- Yeah,

28:10.282 --> 28:13.729
but none of our evidence ties anyone
of them directly to the murder.

28:13.855 --> 28:15.205
So we need something else.

28:15.916 --> 28:16.816
And fast.

28:19.679 --> 28:20.985
This is my floor. Move it.

28:21.111 --> 28:22.515
Lieutenant, Lieutenant!

28:23.725 --> 28:25.418
- Mr. Stein.
- You're not gonna believe this.

28:25.544 --> 28:28.330
I just got the next 20 pages of
The Clubland Murders from the boys.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.418
Okay. I'm listening.

28:29.544 --> 28:31.744
In the new pages,
they kill the club owner.

28:32.126 --> 28:34.586
Okay, that's just the way Cuzz Morales
instructed them to, right ?

28:34.712 --> 28:35.514
Yeah, that's not all.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.747
At the end of the act,

28:36.873 --> 28:38.627
the mob starts planning a new murder.

28:38.753 --> 28:40.231
A new murder ?
Who's the victim ?

28:40.357 --> 28:40.999
I don't know.

28:41.125 --> 28:43.881
They-They just refer to him as
"the snitch." Who's the snitch ?

28:44.007 --> 28:45.291
Do you think they know
I talked to you ?

28:45.417 --> 28:47.030
- I want police protection.
- Mr. Stein... Mr. Stein...

28:47.156 --> 28:49.264
- Like now.
- Mr. Stein, calm down.

28:49.507 --> 28:50.672
Where are they now-- Patrick... ?

28:50.798 --> 28:52.746
I have no idea. The script
got delivered by messenger.

28:52.872 --> 28:54.322
This is not what I paid for!

28:54.533 --> 28:56.457
Mr. Stein, I'm gonna take care of it.

28:56.703 --> 28:59.025
You don't understand. They don't
even reveal who the killer is.

28:59.151 --> 29:00.051
That's my job.

29:06.153 --> 29:07.707
Did you really need to print me ?

29:07.833 --> 29:09.768
Well, if they match the ones
we found on the murder weapon,

29:09.894 --> 29:11.172
then I guess we've got you.

29:11.298 --> 29:13.127
Then I have nothing to worry about.

29:13.636 --> 29:16.795
- Where's your writing partner, Patrick ?
- I don't know.

29:17.575 --> 29:21.525
I'm used to it. He's usually trolling
the beach instead of banging out scenes.

29:22.312 --> 29:23.612
He's not really a writer.

29:24.064 --> 29:25.064
But you are, right ?

29:25.725 --> 29:27.995
You copy what other people say and do

29:28.404 --> 29:30.840
- and profit from it.
- Lesser artists borrow.

29:31.939 --> 29:32.839
The great ones

29:33.451 --> 29:34.351
steal.

29:34.813 --> 29:37.523
Like you stole Cuzz Morales'
life story, right ?

29:39.743 --> 29:41.043
The guy wouldn't shut up.

29:41.647 --> 29:44.048
"Enough about me. What about me ?"

29:45.393 --> 29:46.943
I'm indebted to him, actually.

29:47.154 --> 29:49.604
So indebted that you'd pin
Jake's murder on him ?

29:49.870 --> 29:52.263
You planted the murder weapon
in his office, right ?

29:52.389 --> 29:53.711
I have nothing to do with that.

29:53.837 --> 29:54.737
Patrick,

29:55.486 --> 29:59.624
everything has come true in your script.
Now that's not an accident.

30:00.285 --> 30:01.985
I want to know who the snitch is.

30:02.273 --> 30:03.254
I wish I could help,

30:03.380 --> 30:04.730
but, see, I don't outline.

30:05.279 --> 30:07.041
It limits the imagination.

30:07.380 --> 30:09.077
Okay, well, imagine this, my friend.

30:09.203 --> 30:11.953
You're about to go to jail
for obstruction of justice.

30:17.367 --> 30:19.570
Okay, fine. Cuzz did say one thing.

30:20.982 --> 30:23.732
When he left Joey Salucci,
it didn't go over too well.

30:24.445 --> 30:25.553
Salucci threatened him.

30:25.679 --> 30:28.878
Said... the cops would love to know
about what he did.

30:29.004 --> 30:31.154
And Cuzz killed someone
for him last year.

30:31.717 --> 30:33.767
He was afraid Salucci
would rat him out.

30:35.162 --> 30:37.361
But you did not hear
this from me, okay ?

30:39.173 --> 30:40.073
So, can I go ?

30:40.255 --> 30:43.255
I'm gonna keep you in a holding cell
for 24 hours, Patrick.

30:43.682 --> 30:45.297
- 24 hours ?
- Yes, sir.

30:45.888 --> 30:46.788
You know what ?

30:47.263 --> 30:48.563
Write a scene about that.

30:52.774 --> 30:55.150
Eric, Cuzz is the snitch.
Where is he ?

30:56.363 --> 30:58.746
His attorney got him released.
He could be anywhere by now.

30:58.872 --> 31:01.851
So not only do we have to solve
a murder, we have to prevent one.

31:01.977 --> 31:04.085
It's too late, Horatio.
Call just came in.

31:04.211 --> 31:05.761
Homicide at The Burgundy Club.

31:06.546 --> 31:07.596
Someone killed Cuzz.

31:29.589 --> 31:32.939
Cuzz left holding only an hour ago,
so we know the murder's fresh.

31:33.094 --> 31:35.994
So fresh we can eliminate
Patrick Wilder as the murderer.

31:36.336 --> 31:38.736
And Norman Stein ;
he's under police protection.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.231
Forget the theatrics with this one.

31:41.671 --> 31:43.475
Looks uncalculated and visceral.

31:43.746 --> 31:45.096
Someone beat him to death.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.260
Door's open.

31:59.032 --> 31:59.932
Miami-Dade PD!

32:01.349 --> 32:03.411
If anyone's in here,
show yourself now !

32:10.799 --> 32:11.699
Don't move.

32:13.940 --> 32:14.840
Ben.

32:18.472 --> 32:19.772
What's in your hand, Ben ?

32:27.584 --> 32:28.684
Look, I didn't do it.

32:34.075 --> 32:35.125
You play cards, Ben ?

32:38.609 --> 32:39.759
They call that a tell.

32:48.336 --> 32:49.236
Where's Patrick ?

32:50.058 --> 32:51.752
I don't want to do this without him.

32:51.878 --> 32:53.784
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to.

32:53.910 --> 32:55.692
All the evidence points to you, Ben,

32:55.818 --> 32:57.118
starting with the script.

32:59.457 --> 33:01.357
When we turned in the first 40 pages,

33:02.040 --> 33:02.940
we were pumped.

33:03.933 --> 33:04.983
But Norman hated it.

33:05.830 --> 33:07.448
Said he'd pull the deal.

33:07.877 --> 33:09.027
And you got desperate.

33:10.233 --> 33:12.783
Norman said we had to live
life to write about it.

33:13.107 --> 33:14.407
He introduced us to Cuzz.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.777
And Cuzz helped you
finish the script ?

33:19.879 --> 33:20.779
More than that.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.090
He helped us get a life.

33:24.278 --> 33:25.393
This is just the beginning.

33:25.519 --> 33:26.469
You stick with me,

33:26.693 --> 33:28.943
you'll have enough juice
to make ten movies.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.125
I'm taking over all of Jake's clubs.

33:31.939 --> 33:33.505
I'm gonna be king of South Beach.

33:33.631 --> 33:34.781
How you gonna do that ?

33:35.315 --> 33:36.215
With your help.

33:43.209 --> 33:45.859
Cuzz got you and Patrick
to kill for him, didn't he ?

33:48.558 --> 33:49.858
Said it was a no-brainer.

33:52.306 --> 33:53.206
Jake's gone,

33:54.075 --> 33:56.581
Cuzz gets a promotion, and...
we get full access

33:57.938 --> 33:58.838
to everything.

34:00.644 --> 34:01.994
Did you dose Jake's cigar ?

34:02.538 --> 34:03.656
No, Cuzz did that.

34:04.462 --> 34:06.009
Made it easy for us.

34:06.220 --> 34:07.770
So he wouldn't put up a fight.

34:09.601 --> 34:11.502
He said we had to take it from there,

34:12.304 --> 34:13.646
finish it.

34:15.125 --> 34:17.025
He was too close.
He needed an alibi.

34:18.925 --> 34:20.025
And you believed him ?

34:21.534 --> 34:24.103
Cuzz said it wasn't the first time
he'd get away with murder.

34:24.714 --> 34:28.864
I'll dose his cigar with GHB. He'll be
out cold. Just drop his ass in the canal.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.036
I can't kill him.

34:31.933 --> 34:33.275
I've never shot a gun before.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.802
Ah, it's just a backup plan.
You won't have to.

34:37.922 --> 34:39.672
So we snagged the professor's car.

34:40.069 --> 34:41.418
Everything was going fine.

34:44.370 --> 34:45.270
Come on !

34:48.168 --> 34:49.918
Jake was passed out at this point.

34:54.922 --> 34:56.222
But Patrick messed it up.

35:00.383 --> 35:01.201
What are you doing ?

35:01.327 --> 35:02.627
You heard what Cuzz said.

35:02.827 --> 35:04.527
Shoot the club owner in the eyes.

35:06.652 --> 35:07.852
Are you crazy, Patrick ?

35:08.311 --> 35:09.911
Now I know how a killer thinks.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.125
It was unreal. He took it too far,
started living the story.

35:15.225 --> 35:16.125
Check it out.

35:16.831 --> 35:19.281
Put this in his pocket.
It totally says mob hit.

35:20.489 --> 35:21.389
It's like...

35:21.567 --> 35:22.617
It's like symbolism.

35:38.741 --> 35:40.891
That's when you hung
Jake from the bridge.

35:44.595 --> 35:45.945
And then Cuzz was killed--

35:46.365 --> 35:49.774
or the snitch, I should say--
which is what Patrick wanted.

35:49.900 --> 35:53.450
Patrick convinced me to go back
to the club to get that deck of cards.

35:55.180 --> 35:57.730
Said it was the only thing
tying us to the murder.

35:58.233 --> 35:59.433
But I didn't kill Cuzz.

36:00.855 --> 36:01.755
I swear.

36:08.764 --> 36:10.664
He was already dead
when I got there.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.296
May I see your hands, please ?

36:21.167 --> 36:22.067
I believe you.

36:22.884 --> 36:24.184
You're telling the truth.

36:24.977 --> 36:26.477
Even if you didn't kill Cuzz,

36:29.511 --> 36:30.911
test sheet from your class,

36:32.098 --> 36:34.202
DNA on the ear bud in the trunk,

36:35.297 --> 36:36.497
your prints on the gun,

36:37.847 --> 36:40.697
Jake's murder is all on you, Ben,
and Patrick knew that.

36:47.036 --> 36:48.650
You're a real...

36:50.631 --> 36:53.376
real hands-on guy. Isn't that
what you said, Joseph ?

36:55.010 --> 36:57.025
I roughed up my hands on some pipes.

36:57.212 --> 36:59.596
I had a plumbing problem
at one of the new condo...

36:59.722 --> 37:01.081
That's not what happened, Joseph.

37:01.207 --> 37:04.054
You beat Cuzz to death,
and now I can prove it.

37:04.264 --> 37:05.229
Then get a warrant.

37:05.355 --> 37:06.255
Joseph,

37:06.520 --> 37:10.453
any way I can help you is about to
slide off this table if you don't help me.

37:17.498 --> 37:20.771
Cesar was a good kid. He just,
you know...

37:21.292 --> 37:22.492
he could have gone far.

37:24.195 --> 37:26.048
Just wanted to do things his own way.

37:26.174 --> 37:30.024
You were concerned that he might go
public on the old homicide, weren't you ?

37:33.043 --> 37:34.343
Not till I got that note.

37:38.405 --> 37:39.705
It said, "From a friend--

37:39.925 --> 37:41.125
Cuzz is going to talk."

37:44.411 --> 37:46.261
When I confronted him, he denied it.

37:47.371 --> 37:48.706
He lied right to my face.

37:50.425 --> 37:52.654
You were supposed to get
rid of that gun year ago.

37:52.780 --> 37:54.095
I did, Mr. Salucci. I did.

37:54.221 --> 37:56.750
I got a guy down at PD that said
they just found it on you.

37:58.025 --> 38:01.549
- I kept it. I kept it as insurance.
- Against me ?

38:02.474 --> 38:03.774
I treated you like a son.

38:15.534 --> 38:16.734
The kid had no respect.

38:18.911 --> 38:20.168
Different world today.

38:20.787 --> 38:22.005
Things are different, Joseph,

38:22.131 --> 38:24.981
but the thing that has not changed
and will never change

38:25.421 --> 38:28.288
is the difference
between right and wrong.

38:31.250 --> 38:32.300
You're under arrest.

38:33.490 --> 38:34.390
Take him.

39:11.064 --> 39:14.555
Officer, no offense, but
feels good to get out of there.

39:14.681 --> 39:16.181
You shouldn't be getting out.

39:17.039 --> 39:18.739
State's Attorney made us pop you.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.151
Thanks for catching Ben, you know.

39:24.332 --> 39:25.232
Imagine.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.330
Someone like that,
a violent killer,

39:27.735 --> 39:28.899
right under my nose.

39:29.230 --> 39:31.880
So you're gonna just keep on
denying any involvement

39:32.022 --> 39:33.422
with this whole thing, huh ?

39:34.053 --> 39:36.503
He made all that up.
None of that even happened.

39:37.080 --> 39:40.163
If it did, I could be charged
with felony murder,

39:40.665 --> 39:41.689
if I'm not mistaken.

39:41.815 --> 39:44.065
Not only did it happen,
you orchestrated it.

39:45.318 --> 39:47.049
You planted the gun back on Cuzz.

39:47.376 --> 39:48.976
You knew Ben's print was on it.

39:49.737 --> 39:52.937
And then you made sure Ben went
back to the scene of the crime.

39:53.990 --> 39:57.056
Do you have any
hard evidence to back that theory ?

39:57.357 --> 39:59.407
Then you sent that note
to Joey Salucci.

40:00.170 --> 40:02.469
"From a friend," right ?

40:03.362 --> 40:05.354
You knew he'd go back
and take care of Cuzz,

40:05.480 --> 40:08.180
the only person who could
tie you to the whole thing.

40:08.703 --> 40:11.238
Yeah, that's me.
Keyser Soze.

40:12.246 --> 40:14.046
Now who's watching too many movies ?

40:16.517 --> 40:18.167
If you don't mind, I'm gonna go.

40:20.090 --> 40:20.990
Go ahead.

40:22.270 --> 40:23.382
With a little advice.

40:24.579 --> 40:26.729
You walk and you feel
a shadow behind you,

40:27.668 --> 40:29.868
just know that it won't
always be your own.

40:31.457 --> 40:33.481
- Who, you ?
- Me.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.991

a real mob murder.

40:58.210 --> 40:59.110
See you.
