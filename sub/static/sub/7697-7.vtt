01:30.214 --> 01:32.091
Don't bother trying, Croc.

01:32.174 --> 01:34.552
Those cuffs are stacked
polycarbon alloy.

01:34.635 --> 01:36.429
Not even you can break them.

01:37.805 --> 01:41.475
So they finally declared old Croc sane
and responsible for his crimes.

01:42.059 --> 01:43.603
Took them long enough.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.980
I hear they're giving him
his own cellblock upstate.

01:46.439 --> 01:47.982
Your tax dollars at work.

01:49.358 --> 01:51.736
Wake me if he busts out.
That would be a story.

01:56.824 --> 02:00.828
You know, there's something the brains
back at the joint didn't think about.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.455
Yeah, what's that?

02:02.538 --> 02:06.834
Crocodiles got the strongest jaws
of any animal around.

02:10.713 --> 02:11.922
Get back!

02:14.508 --> 02:16.135
- What was that?
- Did you hear that?

02:17.094 --> 02:18.846
Oh, man. Did he get loose?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.223
I'm not going near that thing.

02:48.417 --> 02:52.380
Batman? Come on.
Can't you do any better than that?

02:53.881 --> 02:58.344
You want a piece of me?
Think you can take the champ?

02:58.427 --> 03:02.014
You're pumped full of sedative, Croc.
You won't get far.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.809
Farther than you.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.070
No-

07:50.552 --> 07:53.847
- Looks like he's been hurt.
- See his chains?

07:53.931 --> 07:55.182
The poor guy.

07:55.265 --> 07:57.184
It's okay. We'll take care of you.

07:57.309 --> 08:01.480
Oh, judgment,
thou art fled to brutish beasts.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.441
And men have lost their reason.

08:05.317 --> 08:06.944
Bring him, good Goliath.

08:23.335 --> 08:24.336
Huh?

08:34.430 --> 08:36.849
Rise and shine.

08:40.602 --> 08:43.480
- Please try and drink some.
- Yes, it's good for you.

08:46.483 --> 08:51.989
Ah, now, that's better, isn't it?
Sorry, we haven't been introduced.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.158
Richard. At your service.

08:54.366 --> 08:58.454
Like Richard III,
I too am rudely stamped.

08:58.996 --> 09:00.956
You have to forgive our dramatic friend.

09:01.498 --> 09:03.000
He's nuts about Shakespeare.

09:03.625 --> 09:06.670
These two sylvan nymphs
are May and June.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.006
- Pleased to meet you.
- Ditto.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.341
And you've met Billy.

09:12.426 --> 09:16.221
You're the one that pulled me
out of the drink, ain't you? I owe you.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.099
And I'm Goliath. I helped haul you in.

09:21.643 --> 09:23.437
So I'll buy you a medal.

09:24.229 --> 09:28.400
No need to be shy.
We're all family here.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.195
It must have been fate
that led you to us.

09:31.278 --> 09:35.240
Yeah. What's a freak show
doing in the middle of nowhere?

09:35.866 --> 09:37.951
You're one to talk, lizard lips.

09:38.494 --> 09:42.581
June, he's a guest.
Our circus days are over.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.418
We used the money we earned to buy
this farm so we could live in peace.

09:47.044 --> 09:51.256
This is a sanctuary,
not only for us but for all our kind.

09:52.007 --> 09:55.302
If you're willing to join in the work,
you too are welcome here.

09:55.844 --> 09:57.638
Is that a fact?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.566
- Hey.
- You did it!

10:09.650 --> 10:13.487
- Bravo. Well done.
- I told you he was strong.

10:13.904 --> 10:16.657
So tell us, friend,
from whence do you hail?

10:17.241 --> 10:20.953
See, I was part of this freak show,
same as you,

10:21.036 --> 10:24.414
only they kept me chained
like an animal. Day and night.

10:24.498 --> 10:28.210
Forced me to live in a tank.
Made me do tricks.

10:28.293 --> 10:30.295
- How awful.
- Jerks.

10:30.629 --> 10:34.800
Yeah. They fed me
fish heads and stale bread.

10:34.883 --> 10:40.347
When I tried to get away, they worked me
over pretty good, put me in chains.

10:47.896 --> 10:50.482
Don't worry. Nobody will find you here.

10:50.607 --> 10:52.860
Haven't seen a soul since we moved in.

10:53.318 --> 10:56.029
That's good, real good.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.039
Ah!

11:12.212 --> 11:14.214
And they say the city's dangerous.

11:17.968 --> 11:20.053
No, I don't mind
sleeping out on the straw.

11:20.429 --> 11:24.683
- Go ahead and take my bedroom.
- Don't put yourself out for me.

11:24.933 --> 11:26.852
The cot's too small anyway.

11:27.060 --> 11:28.979
And tomorrow we'll go
swimming, right, Croc?

11:29.563 --> 11:32.649
There's the coolest grottos along
the river. It's like another world.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.904
Yeah, sure, kid.
Too bad I forgot my bathing suit.

11:37.738 --> 11:41.200
That's right. Our new friend here
is going to need additional raiment.

11:42.326 --> 11:46.163
- He means clothes.
- Yeah? You guys got money?

11:46.246 --> 11:50.834
Just a small nest egg left over
from the purchase of this mill.

11:51.251 --> 11:52.794
Fifty thousand.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.340
Thank you, Goliath.

11:56.423 --> 11:59.259
It's not something we like to broadcast.

12:00.177 --> 12:03.931
Fifty grand?
A guy could go to town on that.

12:49.601 --> 12:50.686
Croc?

12:52.980 --> 12:57.609
- What you doing?
- Looking for a blanket. I'm cold.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.528
I'll find you one.

13:02.906 --> 13:04.032
I got it, shorty.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.325
You know, Croc,

13:05.409 --> 13:08.328
I know you feel a little funny
being here, but it's great.

13:08.620 --> 13:12.958
It really is. No one stares at you,
laughing, making you feel bad.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.418
You can be yourself.

13:15.043 --> 13:17.212
Yeah, great. Whatever.

13:29.349 --> 13:30.350
Huh?

13:33.645 --> 13:36.440
Calm down. I won't hurt you.

13:36.940 --> 13:39.693
I'm looking for someone.
Half man, half crocodile.

13:41.653 --> 13:44.573
- He's in there, isn't he?
- No. Stay away.

13:47.492 --> 13:48.744
He's one of us.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.620
Croc, run!

13:56.543 --> 13:59.796
- I don't want to hurt you.
- Don't worry. You won't.

14:16.563 --> 14:17.939
You.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.155
Richard, help!

14:34.873 --> 14:37.751
Quickly. Quickly. In there.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.681
Ha! Who's the freak now, Bats?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.893
- Who is he?
- A nutcase in a mask.

14:54.976 --> 14:58.105
- He's the one who put me in the tank.
- Don't listen to him.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.024
His name's Killer Croc. He's dangerous.

15:02.484 --> 15:06.154
Quiet! Don't think you're
gonna fool my friends, do you?

15:06.321 --> 15:08.782
They know my story. I'm one of them.

15:09.157 --> 15:13.954
Yes. And his chains speak more
eloquently than any words of yours.

15:14.538 --> 15:19.084
Listen to me. He's an escaped convict,
a cold-blooded killer.

15:19.334 --> 15:20.669
I said shut up!

15:23.463 --> 15:25.882
What he said, it's not true, is it?

15:26.133 --> 15:28.176
You're being square with us,
aren't you, Croc?

15:28.677 --> 15:33.515
'Course I am. I ain't the one who
attacked big boy in his sleep, am I?

15:35.225 --> 15:36.852
What are we gonna do?

15:38.395 --> 15:39.771
Get rid of him.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.649
What do you mean?

15:44.734 --> 15:48.405
If he gets loose, he'll bring 'em all
down on us. No one's safe.

15:48.780 --> 15:50.532
The bat's gotta go.

15:59.416 --> 16:03.920
It's your last hunt, Bats.
And now you're the prey.

16:05.672 --> 16:07.591
Croc, no. Don't do this.

16:08.091 --> 16:10.177
- You can't.
- It's not right.

16:11.887 --> 16:13.847
I can and I will.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.809
No killing.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.395
Why, you dirty...

16:23.064 --> 16:26.610
Stay out of this!
This is between me and the bat.

16:27.736 --> 16:30.238
- But you can't kill him.
- He's still a human being.

16:31.615 --> 16:35.076
- Who are you calling human?
- Oh, Croc.

16:35.619 --> 16:39.581
Alas, I fear that the chameleon
has shown his true colors.

16:40.123 --> 16:44.294
I think you should leave, my friend.
We've had enough of these shenanigans.

16:46.171 --> 16:49.841
Well, kid, looks like we're gonna
have to postpone that little swim.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.218
Watch out!

16:52.135 --> 16:53.428
Hey!

17:01.102 --> 17:03.021
The bigger they are, eh, Bats?

17:11.821 --> 17:13.949
The evil that men do...

17:15.116 --> 17:16.535
Stuff the Shakespeare.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.995
You're lucky you're still around
to recite it.

17:19.746 --> 17:21.665
You I'm not done with yet.

17:28.755 --> 17:29.881
All right.

17:46.481 --> 17:47.774
Hey!

17:48.775 --> 17:52.279
Lookie here, Bats.
Got a couple of souvenirs.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.409
One for you too.

17:57.993 --> 18:00.662
Don't want you talking about me
when I'm gone.

18:58.011 --> 19:02.932
Give it up, Bats. You can't take me.
I got the high ground. I got the gun.

19:04.559 --> 19:05.935
I know a way in.

19:29.751 --> 19:30.752
Huh?

19:42.347 --> 19:43.348
Hyah!

19:43.431 --> 19:44.808
You're guano, bat.

20:37.485 --> 20:38.570
What?

21:00.049 --> 21:01.676
Show's over, folks.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.977
Okay, guys. All set.

21:11.770 --> 21:14.647
Why, Croc?
Why did you turn on us like that?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.942
We could have helped you.
We could have done something.

21:18.318 --> 21:21.404
You said you can be yourself
out here, remember?

21:22.155 --> 21:24.449
Well, I guess that's what I was doing.

21:24.532 --> 21:26.034
Being myself.

22:18.419 --> 22:19.629
English - SDH
