[animal growling]

00:07.875 --> 00:11.250
-[screeching]
-[howling]

00:12.041 --> 00:14.041
[adventurous music playing]

00:19.708 --> 00:24.000
Here we are in the deepest,
darkest swamps of Louisiana,

00:24.083 --> 00:26.833
investigating reports
of a mysterious creature,

00:26.916 --> 00:29.458
-and the stench of death is everywhere.
-[growling]

00:29.541 --> 00:31.041
Um, that wasn't me.

00:31.125 --> 00:33.500
-Aah! So many mosquitoes!
-[mosquitoes buzzing]

00:33.583 --> 00:35.166
Hey, why are you filming this?

00:35.250 --> 00:38.083
This swamp
is a favorite body-dumping ground

00:38.166 --> 00:39.375
for serial killers,

00:39.458 --> 00:43.708
which is why the wild animals
have a taste for human flesh.

00:43.791 --> 00:46.458
Someone needs to make
an acclaimed independent film

00:46.541 --> 00:48.250
so our families know what happened to us

00:48.333 --> 00:50.708
when they find our soggy,
half-eaten corpses.

00:50.791 --> 00:52.875
Aah! I'm already half-eaten.

00:52.958 --> 00:55.458
Come on, Dietrich. Ham it up a little bit.

00:55.541 --> 00:58.083
We're on a monster hunt in a murder swamp.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.875
[BTG] Not a monster, an invasive species,

01:00.958 --> 01:04.625
which, technically speaking,
is called an alien species.

01:04.708 --> 01:06.791
Ooh, an alien monster!

01:06.875 --> 01:10.208
Why do we have to look for new monsters?
We're surrounded by monsters already.

01:10.291 --> 01:13.708
Ooh! What are the chances
that we find an alpha-draconian reptilian,

01:13.791 --> 01:16.166
who feeds off chaos
and shoots lasers out of his eyes?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.416
Extremely low.

01:17.500 --> 01:21.875
Although, horned lizards shoot toxic blood
out of their eye sockets,

01:21.958 --> 01:23.291
kinda like lasers.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.625
So, alien monsters <i>are</i> real.

01:25.708 --> 01:30.833
No, but pretty much anything you can
imagine an animal doing, an animal does,

01:30.916 --> 01:34.166
and also countless things
you can't even begin to imagine.

01:34.250 --> 01:37.625
Oh, no one's getting out
of this swamp alive.

01:38.416 --> 01:39.416
[farts]

01:40.416 --> 01:42.791
Okay, that time, it was me. [chuckles]

01:42.875 --> 01:44.541
[animal growling]

01:44.625 --> 01:47.750
-[screeching]
-[howling]

01:49.708 --> 01:51.833
[Bonnie] The residents
of this sleepy community

01:51.916 --> 01:55.166
have come in contact
with a creature so bizarre

01:55.250 --> 01:57.083
no one can explain it.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.125
I saw it.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.750
It came out of the trees
with big, glowing eyes.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.500
And I think it ate my cat.

02:02.583 --> 02:07.041
It was yellow.
I think it was a bear dog, or a hog dog.

02:07.125 --> 02:11.083
-[Bonnie] Have you seen the monster?
-The only monster I know is my husband.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.583
[Bonnie] Okay, lady.

02:12.666 --> 02:16.833
And now, our hunt
for the Louisiana swamp beast begins.

02:16.916 --> 02:18.416
-[spits, screams]
-[growls]

02:19.333 --> 02:23.833
[BTG] So, can you tell me again exactly
where and when you last saw the animal?

02:23.916 --> 02:26.958
It's not an animal, I'm telling you.
It's a demon.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.000
I've never seen anything like it.

02:29.083 --> 02:32.958
<i>I was out here watching my cat,</i>
<i>Mr. Peppers, doing one of his lick baths,</i>

02:33.041 --> 02:35.208
<i>when, suddenly, in the darkness,</i>

02:35.291 --> 02:37.041
<i>I saw glowing devil eyes.</i>

02:37.125 --> 02:39.125
<i>He opened his unholy aperture,</i>

02:39.208 --> 02:42.208
<i>and I swear I could see</i>
<i>straight into the gates of hell.</i>

02:42.291 --> 02:44.666
<i>You could hear the haunted chorus</i>
<i>of childrens' souls</i>

02:44.750 --> 02:47.791
<i>screaming for their mothers</i>
<i>in tortured oblivion.</i>

02:48.375 --> 02:51.333
And now my little Mr. Peppers is missing.

02:51.416 --> 02:54.416
-Could be a shadow person. Or a banshee.
-[whimpers]

02:54.500 --> 02:55.916
A poltergeist, maybe.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.500
This just sounds like a potoo.

02:57.583 --> 03:01.166
No, not "po-two."
It's pronounced "poltergeist."

03:01.250 --> 03:04.333
I'm not trying to say "polter-geist."
Polter-jizz, polter-guest.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.250
-What?
-What?

03:06.333 --> 03:10.791
The potoo is an extraordinary-looking bird
from the Amazon rainforest.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.916
It's got big, bulging eyes

03:13.000 --> 03:15.500
that can change
from yellow to pitch-black,

03:15.583 --> 03:19.500
and they have slits in their eyelids
which allow them to sense movement

03:19.583 --> 03:21.500
even when their eyes are closed.

03:21.583 --> 03:25.500
They blend in perfectly against trees,
making them almost invisible.

03:25.583 --> 03:28.541
They can swallow small birds whole.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.541
Ow!

03:29.625 --> 03:31.458
But creepiest of all,

03:31.541 --> 03:34.000
their haunting call eerily resembles

03:34.083 --> 03:36.708
a desperate child
crying out for its mother.

03:36.791 --> 03:38.125
[squawking] Mom!

03:38.208 --> 03:40.916
[shudders] Ooh.
Creepy at a testicular level.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
[shudders, screams]

03:42.083 --> 03:42.916
[grunts]

03:43.000 --> 03:47.750
It sounds like we're dealing
with an invasive Amazonian avian species.

03:47.833 --> 03:50.666
But how could a potoo
make it all the way here?

03:50.750 --> 03:53.750
It couldn't. But I know what could.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.083
Demons are running loose in Louisiana,

03:56.166 --> 04:00.000
and we need to find Satan's hell tunnel
and close it before it's too late.

04:00.083 --> 04:02.125
Keep an eye out
for abandoned refrigerators.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.958
[groans]

04:04.041 --> 04:05.291
I know what it is.

04:05.958 --> 04:07.583
I never told anyone this before,

04:07.666 --> 04:10.083
but when I was just a little boy
in Canada,

04:10.708 --> 04:13.291
<i>my mother gave me a salamander as a pet.</i>

04:13.375 --> 04:16.875
<i>His name was Slippy,</i>
<i>and he looked so scary, I couldn't sleep.</i>

04:17.375 --> 04:20.125
<i>So, one night, I did the unthinkable.</i>

04:20.750 --> 04:22.625
-[water splashes]
-[flushing]

04:22.708 --> 04:26.416
<i>As I watched him circling the bowl,</i>
<i>I felt a great shame.</i>

04:26.958 --> 04:29.375
<i>And before it was swallowed</i>
<i>by the plumbing void,</i>

04:29.458 --> 04:33.208
<i>he gave me a look of sworn vengeance.</i>

04:35.916 --> 04:37.666
He vanished into the sewers,

04:37.750 --> 04:39.708
gateway to the wild and unknown,

04:39.791 --> 04:44.541
and I always knew that, one day,
he would hunt me down and kill me.

04:44.625 --> 04:47.666
You think you'll be killed
by an angry turd in a condom?

04:47.750 --> 04:49.041
Come on, Dietrich.

04:49.125 --> 04:51.291
Flushing a pet is a jerk move,

04:51.375 --> 04:54.041
but even if your salamander
survived the flush,

04:54.125 --> 04:58.458
there's no way it could travel
from Canada to Louisiana via the sewer.

04:58.541 --> 05:02.166
And even if it did,
it would be eaten by gators immediately.

05:02.250 --> 05:05.458
And even if it wasn't,
their life span is 20 years max,

05:05.541 --> 05:07.083
so it's probably dead.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.750
Unless it's alive,
in which case, it's huge.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.041
[woman screaming]

05:13.375 --> 05:14.500
He's coming.

05:14.583 --> 05:15.958
[suspenseful music playing]

05:18.333 --> 05:20.750
I saw it! The alien is up there.

05:20.833 --> 05:24.000
-You mean the demon?
-No, you mean the potoo.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.458
No! You mean a big, slimy salamander

05:26.541 --> 05:28.666
holding a lock
of my golden childhood hair!

05:28.750 --> 05:30.750
No. It was an alien!

05:31.458 --> 05:33.916
<i>I was doing my pre-dinner leg stretches.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:37.250
<i>I read online that doing 15 minutes</i>
<i>of leg stretches before dinner</i>

05:37.333 --> 05:38.541
<i>helps with digestion.</i>

05:38.625 --> 05:41.333
<i>It's probably why</i>
<i>ballet dancers are so skinny.</i>

05:41.416 --> 05:44.875
<i>Then my husband Don said</i>
<i>that was a bunch of new age hooey.</i>

05:44.958 --> 05:47.458
<i>But I do my dinner stretching,</i>
<i>and it feels good.</i>

05:47.541 --> 05:48.625
<i>He doesn't own me.</i>

05:48.708 --> 05:49.916
Okay, we get it.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.083
Leg stretches, Don's a douche.
What about the alien?

05:53.166 --> 05:54.666
All right, <i>chère</i>!

05:54.750 --> 05:57.875
<i>I beheld an outrageous-looking creature</i>
<i>from another world.</i>

05:57.958 --> 06:02.166
<i>It had tiny, orange eyes,</i>
<i>bright with wickedness,</i>

06:02.250 --> 06:06.541
<i>big old ears, and one long, bony finger,</i>

06:06.625 --> 06:11.166
<i>that I swear it uses to paralyze</i>
<i>and/or probe its abductees. </i>[whimpers]

06:11.250 --> 06:12.500
There it is!

06:12.583 --> 06:14.208
[rustling]

06:14.291 --> 06:18.000
Lay your space finger on me,
celestial visitor.

06:18.083 --> 06:23.083
Take me to the outer realms
and away from Don the Unworthy! [sighs]

06:23.166 --> 06:25.291
Ugh! Finally. Let's go.

06:25.375 --> 06:26.625
[adventurous music playing]

06:26.708 --> 06:29.458
Why are we running towards it
when we should be running away?

06:29.541 --> 06:30.875
[yelps] Cramp!

06:30.958 --> 06:33.750
<i>Très mal!</i> I didn't finish my stretches!

06:34.666 --> 06:35.666
Headlamps on.

06:36.166 --> 06:38.166
[birds cawing]

06:40.833 --> 06:43.208
-[animals screeching]
-[pants, screams]

06:44.166 --> 06:45.958
Alien! [yelps]

06:46.041 --> 06:47.166
[grunts]

06:48.250 --> 06:50.750
No! Don't take me to space!

06:50.833 --> 06:53.666
Zero gravity aggravates
my vestibular disorder!

06:53.750 --> 06:57.458
-[Bonnie] I got you, Dietrich.
-Don't worry, it's just an aye-aye.

06:57.541 --> 06:59.500
So, it <i>is</i> an alien!

06:59.583 --> 07:01.500
The aye-aye from Madagascar

07:01.583 --> 07:04.208
looks like a possessed alien
with rat's teeth,

07:04.291 --> 07:08.916
but is actually just a shy nocturnal lemur
with long, bony fingers

07:09.000 --> 07:12.708
that are ideally suited
to giving nonconsensual rectal probes,

07:12.791 --> 07:17.291
but are actually especially adapted
to hunting wood-boring larvae.

07:19.541 --> 07:20.958
-Hmm?
-[leaves rustle]

07:21.541 --> 07:22.666
Hmm.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.458
Why would a primitive lemur
from Madagascar

07:25.541 --> 07:27.416
be in the Louisiana wetlands?

07:27.500 --> 07:28.791
-[screeching]
-[BTG gasps]

07:28.875 --> 07:31.666
-Take the aye-aye.
-Aye aye on the aye-aye!

07:31.750 --> 07:33.541
-[laughs]
-[Bonnie chuckles]

07:33.625 --> 07:35.250
Wow! That was good.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.000
[groans] Okay.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.916
[grunts]

07:39.000 --> 07:40.750
[leaves rustling]

07:40.833 --> 07:42.791
-[potoo squawks]
-[screams]

07:44.083 --> 07:45.916
A potoo and an aye-aye,

07:46.000 --> 07:50.333
two invasive species
from totally different parts of the world.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.666
[groans] We might be dealing
with a wildlife smuggler.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.583
-[squawks]
-We should get them back to the boat.

07:56.666 --> 07:58.916
If they stay in this unfamiliar habitat,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.708
they'll either die horrible deaths
due to lack of suitable food,

08:02.791 --> 08:08.250
or even worse, they'll thrive,
and destroy this entire ecosystem.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.791
-[leaves rustling]
-Wait, did you see that?

08:12.541 --> 08:13.791
I could swear I saw an--

08:13.875 --> 08:14.750
-[screams]
-Whoa!

08:14.833 --> 08:15.833
[grunts]

08:16.958 --> 08:19.000
-[groans]
-No, my camera!

08:19.541 --> 08:21.791
[sighs] Thanks, aye-aye.

08:21.875 --> 08:24.583
Guess someone doesn't want me
to win a Saturn Award.

08:24.666 --> 08:25.708
[man grunting]

08:25.791 --> 08:27.791
[panting]

08:31.166 --> 08:33.416
The aye-aye finger drew blood.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.291
Oh no. Am I gonna turn
into a long-fingered ghoul?

08:36.375 --> 08:39.250
You're gonna be just fine.
You've had your rabies shots, right?

08:39.333 --> 08:41.291
Well, yeah. I get one every month.

08:41.375 --> 08:42.916
Okay, that's way too often.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.833
-[darts buzzing]
-Phew. These mosquitoes are next level.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.583
That's no mosquito. Look!

08:47.666 --> 08:48.958
[man laughing]

08:49.041 --> 08:51.041
[gasps] Something else <i>is</i> out there!

[laughing evilly]

08:52.958 --> 08:55.083
[sinister music playing]

08:55.166 --> 08:56.166
Wait here.

08:57.666 --> 08:59.250
[potoo squawking]

08:59.333 --> 09:01.875
Um, can we wait somewhere less terrifying?

09:01.958 --> 09:02.916
Good idea.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
Let's see where those lights
are coming from.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.666
[eerie carnival music playing]

09:07.500 --> 09:09.958
Agh, this is so much worse.

09:12.333 --> 09:15.625
I always loved carnivals, until today.

09:15.708 --> 09:16.875
[whimpers]

09:17.458 --> 09:19.875
Ooh, even the prizes are creepy.

09:19.958 --> 09:21.708
I can feel Slippy's presence.

09:23.291 --> 09:26.583
-[screeching]
-[screams] Help! The toys are alive!

09:27.083 --> 09:28.166

-[whimpers]

09:31.625 --> 09:33.916

-That devil monkey broke my glasses.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.458
-That's no devil.
-[both screams]

09:35.541 --> 09:38.208
That's a bald uakari.
I studied them in Brazil.

09:38.291 --> 09:39.208
Listen to this.

[imitates monkey chatter]

09:40.625 --> 09:42.666
-[shrieking]
-[imitates monkey squealing]

09:43.250 --> 09:45.708
Stop squealing and tell me
what the hell happened to you.

09:45.791 --> 09:49.291
[sighs] I feel no one appreciates
how accurate my primate calls are.

09:49.375 --> 09:52.791
Someone or something
hit me in the head with this.

09:52.875 --> 09:54.083
Jesus, Uncle B!

09:54.166 --> 09:56.791
Come on,
we have an exotic monkey to rescue.

09:57.791 --> 10:00.750
[Bonnie] He's leading us
to a secret underground military base

10:00.833 --> 10:03.250
used to hide repurposed alien technology.

10:03.333 --> 10:08.250
Uh, no, it's some kind
of illegal exotic zoo of smuggled animals.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.666
-[alarm sounding]
-Guys, we have company.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.541
[BTG] Komodo dragon.

10:13.625 --> 10:16.166
Look at that eager tongue
with the flickering of a flame.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.333
You know,
some say they were the inspiration

10:18.416 --> 10:20.125
for the fire-breathing dragon legend.

10:20.208 --> 10:23.250
[Bonnie] That's fascinating,
but there's five of them now.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.583
-Okay, let's all just back away slowly.
-[Komodo dragons hissing]

10:26.666 --> 10:30.500
Their toxic jaws could inflict
hideous wounds and deadly infection.

10:30.583 --> 10:33.250
Yep, someone's definitely trying
to kill you, Uncle B.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.750
[all screaming]

10:35.833 --> 10:37.083
Wait for me!

10:37.708 --> 10:38.916
[hissing]

10:42.208 --> 10:43.208
There's no way out!

10:43.291 --> 10:45.000
Yes, there is.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.291
[grunts] This way!

10:48.458 --> 10:50.416
-[hissing]
-[screams]

10:50.958 --> 10:52.625
[pants, grunts]

10:52.708 --> 10:53.875
[door clatters]

10:54.750 --> 10:56.750
[footsteps approaching]

10:59.375 --> 11:01.291
[sucks air, sighs]

11:01.375 --> 11:03.583
Well, so much for capri pants this summer.

11:03.666 --> 11:07.208
All you do is save animals.
Why would anyone want you dead?

11:07.291 --> 11:09.625
His BO is pretty ripe, just saying.

11:09.708 --> 11:11.208
-[sniffing]
-Um…

11:11.333 --> 11:14.416
-Blech!
-Uncle B, does this look familiar to you?

11:15.791 --> 11:17.833
[BTG] Bertrand Theon Greive.

11:17.916 --> 11:19.583
[Dietrich] Bertrand Theon Greive?

11:19.666 --> 11:20.625
No!

11:21.250 --> 11:22.166
Wait, who's that?

11:22.250 --> 11:23.708
Our estranged cousin.

11:23.791 --> 11:27.416
He sullied the Greive name
by selling endangered animals for profit.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.166
I thought he died years ago.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.083
As did I.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.791
Do you think he faked his death?

11:32.875 --> 11:33.958
I don't know.

11:34.041 --> 11:37.125
But his initials are also BTG,

11:37.208 --> 11:40.875
so if he is alive,
he might just try to kill me

11:40.958 --> 11:43.583
in order to become
the next Grieve expedition leader.

11:43.666 --> 11:47.083
[laughs] But that wouldn't work
unless he killed you as well.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.541
[laughs] Right, Bonnie?

11:49.375 --> 11:50.375
Bonnie?

11:50.916 --> 11:52.666
[suspenseful music playing]

11:52.750 --> 11:53.750
[echoing] Bonnie?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.208
Dietrich!

11:58.750 --> 12:00.000
Bonnie?

12:02.791 --> 12:04.583
[screeching]

12:06.875 --> 12:08.291
[echoing] Bonnie?

12:09.833 --> 12:11.166
Dietrich!

12:12.291 --> 12:15.208
-Where are you guys?
-[rumbling]

12:16.291 --> 12:18.000
[grunting]

12:18.083 --> 12:19.416
[light flickering]

12:19.500 --> 12:21.500
[muffled screams]

12:25.916 --> 12:27.791
Bonnie! [grunting]

12:29.958 --> 12:32.208
Bonnie! What the hell happened?

12:32.291 --> 12:35.416
[sighs] He's alive!
Your psycho cousin lives!

12:35.500 --> 12:36.375
[muffled yelling]

12:36.500 --> 12:37.708
What is it, Dietrich?

12:37.791 --> 12:38.708
[sniffing]

12:38.791 --> 12:40.291
I smell warm almonds.

12:40.375 --> 12:43.250
Mmm, I love hot nuts.

12:43.333 --> 12:46.541
Wait, that's not almonds,
that's hydrogen cyanide.

12:46.625 --> 12:48.791
Whoa, did you just say cyanide?

12:48.875 --> 12:51.000
Like spy-suicide-capsule cyanide?

12:51.083 --> 12:52.458
Uh, not quite.

12:53.458 --> 12:54.875
Pink dragon millipedes.

12:54.958 --> 12:57.250
They emit cyanide naturally as a defense.

12:57.333 --> 13:00.125
There might be enough
in this enclosed space to kill us all!

13:00.208 --> 13:01.958
We have to leave, now!

13:02.041 --> 13:03.958
[grunting]

13:04.041 --> 13:06.958
We're locked in.
Why are there so many doors in this place?

13:07.041 --> 13:08.125
Oh God!

13:08.208 --> 13:10.833
We're gonna be killed
by toxic millipede gas!

13:10.916 --> 13:12.416
My hairdresser was right!

13:12.500 --> 13:14.333
[evil laughter]

13:14.416 --> 13:16.833
Did I just summon a giant robot clown?

13:18.208 --> 13:20.041
[in disguised voice]<i> Hello, cousins.</i>

13:20.125 --> 13:22.916
<i>I couldn't believe it</i>
<i>when I heard you were here.</i>

13:23.000 --> 13:25.833
<i>-Welcome to my exotic menagerie.</i>
-[gas hissing]

13:25.916 --> 13:29.041
<i>I have captured</i>
<i>the strangest animals you can imagine,</i>

13:29.125 --> 13:31.000
<i>from all over the world.</i>

13:31.083 --> 13:32.625
[all coughing]

13:32.708 --> 13:35.833
I never thought I'd die
in a carnival office.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.458
Human cannonball accident,
a throwing knife fight, maybe?

13:39.541 --> 13:42.500
[Bertrude]<i> I hope</i>
<i>you enjoy tonight's red-hot finale</i>

13:42.583 --> 13:45.000
<i>by my Australian firebirds</i>,

13:45.083 --> 13:48.583
<i>who will burn away</i>
<i>all evidence of your existence.</i>

13:48.666 --> 13:51.750
[coughs] He's kidding, right?
Birds don't start fires.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.375
[BTG coughing] No, he's not.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.916
Many Australian raptors hunt
by dropping burning embers into dry grass

13:57.000 --> 13:59.916
to start forest fires
and force prey out into the open.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.125
Oh boy,
those poor birds look so emaciated.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.000
We gotta get out of here!

14:05.083 --> 14:06.250
[coughing]

14:06.333 --> 14:07.416
I have an idea.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.791
I'll eat the millipedes
and let their gas consume me.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.500
[retching]

14:12.583 --> 14:15.500
And that'll give you enough time
to figure out an escape.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.333
-[coughing]
-That's a stupid idea.

14:17.875 --> 14:21.208
Wait. The millipedes!
I think there's a way out.

14:23.375 --> 14:24.541
Grab my hand, Dietrich!

14:24.625 --> 14:27.166
[gasps] That seems reasonable.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.625
[wheezing]

14:29.750 --> 14:31.208
Mmm. [retches]

14:31.291 --> 14:32.250
Ugh. [spits]

14:32.333 --> 14:33.666
That's just… No.

14:34.708 --> 14:36.500
[fire blazing]

14:37.083 --> 14:40.416
[BTG] This is bad. Come on,
we need to get the animals out of here.

14:40.500 --> 14:42.500
[Bonnie] How? There's too many to carry!

14:43.208 --> 14:44.250
[BTG] Hmm.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.458
[engine starts]

14:46.541 --> 14:48.541
[grunting]

14:53.833 --> 14:54.750
There you go.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.750
Keep all one thousand arms and legs
inside the ride at all times.

14:57.833 --> 14:59.750
[laughs]

14:59.833 --> 15:01.791
Oh, wow!

15:01.875 --> 15:04.500
You guys are on fire today, literally!

15:04.583 --> 15:08.333
Oh, Dietrich,
self-respect is like a muscle,

15:08.416 --> 15:11.000
-and if you… You know what? Never mind.
-[explodes]

15:11.083 --> 15:12.583
Bonnie, let's go!

15:12.666 --> 15:13.791
Wait, look!

15:13.875 --> 15:16.750
It's Slippy, my old toilet friend!

15:17.416 --> 15:18.750
Don't be scared, Dietrich.

15:18.833 --> 15:21.166
You may have wronged
this creature in the past,

15:21.250 --> 15:24.125
but now it's time… time for redemption.

15:24.666 --> 15:25.958
I'll save you, Slippy!

15:26.041 --> 15:28.500
[sighs] Great, here you go.
Go, go, go, go!

15:28.583 --> 15:29.500
[engine revving]

15:32.833 --> 15:34.916
[sighs] Okay, here's the plan.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.875
We'll take these animals home,
get your head wound stitched up,

15:37.958 --> 15:38.833
we come back here,

15:38.916 --> 15:41.291
and we beat the living crap
out of our creepy cousin.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.958
Good plan. Simple, violent, inelegant.

15:44.041 --> 15:46.208
-Where do you wanna go first?
-Here's what I'm thinking--

15:46.291 --> 15:47.958
-[screaming]
-[brakes squealing]

15:48.750 --> 15:50.458
Agh, bloody hell.

15:50.541 --> 15:54.791
[in French accent] You think this is over?
I'll be seeing you, Cousin Bradley.

15:54.875 --> 15:56.875
<i>Mon petit babou.</i>

15:56.958 --> 15:58.750
[laughs evilly]

15:58.833 --> 16:00.208
-Go, go, go!
-[ties squeal]

16:01.583 --> 16:03.583
[continues laughing]

16:04.625 --> 16:06.500
[clenching teeth] Get this off of me.

16:06.583 --> 16:07.875
[grunts] Um…

16:08.750 --> 16:12.333
Hey, Bonnie, if you see a bathroom,
can you please pull over?

16:12.416 --> 16:13.458
I, um…

16:13.541 --> 16:16.000
<i>Yeah, I… I really need to go.</i>

16:20.125 --> 16:22.125
[groovy music playing]
