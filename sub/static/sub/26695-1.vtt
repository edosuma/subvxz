00:31.513 --> 00:33.481
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:33.483 --> 00:34.548
my name is Simon.

00:34.550 --> 00:35.783
My name's Simon.

00:35.785 --> 00:36.788
My name's Simon.

00:37.621 --> 00:39.622
Hey Tex, where you from,
Cincinnati?

00:39.624 --> 00:41.825
Hey Tex, where you from?
Cincinnati?

00:42.426 --> 00:44.626
How did the punk rocker
cross the street?

00:44.628 --> 00:46.530
He stapled a chicken
to his head.

00:46.764 --> 00:47.829
Hey, doc.

00:47.831 --> 00:49.897
I got this problem,
nobody pays attention to me.

00:49.899 --> 00:51.502
Next, please.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.302
Hey, doc. I got this problem,

00:54.304 --> 00:56.774
I can't make friends,
you big fat fucking slob.

00:57.041 --> 00:58.306
Hey!

00:58.308 --> 00:59.677
Grasshopper walks into a bar.

01:00.845 --> 01:02.578
Bartender looks
at the grasshopper and says,

01:02.580 --> 01:04.513
"Hey, you know we got a drink
named after you?"

01:04.515 --> 01:05.714
Grasshopper says,

01:05.716 --> 01:07.552
"You got a drink
named Herman? Ho!"

01:09.454 --> 01:11.490
Hey Tex, where you from,
Cincinnati?

01:14.326 --> 01:17.527
So I walk into this bar,
and go to the bartender and say,

01:17.529 --> 01:19.899
"Hey, you wanna hear
a good Polish joke?"

01:20.731 --> 01:23.501
He goes... "I'm Polish.

01:23.901 --> 01:25.538
You see that guy
with the big neck?

01:26.004 --> 01:29.242
He's fucking Polish.
Still wanna tell that joke?"

01:29.741 --> 01:31.775
I said, "No." He goes,
"Why, you're scared?"

01:31.777 --> 01:33.710
"No." "Then why don't you want
to tell the joke?"

01:33.712 --> 01:35.681
"I don't want
to explain it twice."

01:37.083 --> 01:38.082
Cheers.

01:38.084 --> 01:39.486
<i>Salud.</i>

01:44.390 --> 01:45.726
Whoa.

01:46.059 --> 01:48.796
I get a message.
"Sally wants to talk to you.

01:49.028 --> 01:50.662
Do you have time?"

01:50.664 --> 01:52.531
Do I have time? Come on,
I always have time for you.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.098
I need you to do me
a little favor,

01:54.100 --> 01:55.335
it's about Simon.

01:55.703 --> 01:57.438
It's a big night tonight.

01:57.704 --> 02:00.639
I'd love for you to give
Simon a chance.

02:00.641 --> 02:02.543
Just this once. It's a big deal.

02:04.545 --> 02:05.612
Sal.

02:05.846 --> 02:08.012
- Simon, the joke thief?
- I know, I know.

02:08.014 --> 02:09.715
Well, you know...

02:09.717 --> 02:11.716
There's people here who don't
exactly love him, you know?

02:11.718 --> 02:13.885
I care about the guy,
he's a good guy.

02:13.887 --> 02:15.822
But you're asking a lot.

02:15.824 --> 02:17.055
He tells a good joke.

02:17.057 --> 02:18.623
When he tells them,
they're funny.

02:18.625 --> 02:19.792
He's funny.

02:19.794 --> 02:21.026
He's a little funny worm,
isn't he?

02:21.028 --> 02:23.631
Yeah, and he steals
from the best.

02:24.966 --> 02:26.735
You want me to do
a favor for him?

02:27.034 --> 02:29.337
Or you want me to do
a favor for you?

02:29.636 --> 02:31.069
It's the same thing.
Look, I want...

02:31.071 --> 02:33.438
- Uh, uh, uh!
- It's the same thing.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.740
I mean, I want him to be able

02:34.742 --> 02:36.075
to prove to himself
that he can do it.

02:36.077 --> 02:38.145
This is national.
This is going national!

02:38.147 --> 02:40.884
For me, is this a favor for you?

02:41.517 --> 02:42.782
Yeah. It's a favor for me.

02:42.784 --> 02:44.151
Then it's done.
Why do you even ask?

02:44.153 --> 02:46.620
You know, for you,
I would do anything.

02:46.622 --> 02:48.757
- Put him on.
- I love you, man.

03:02.539 --> 03:03.637
Yeah?

03:03.639 --> 03:05.041
Hey, Simon. Hi, it's Seb.

03:05.441 --> 03:07.141
Uh... You want something to eat?

03:07.143 --> 03:08.379
<i>What do you mean?</i>

03:09.380 --> 03:11.512
What are you, Jenny Craig,
you wanna feed me?

03:11.514 --> 03:12.946
No, no!

03:12.948 --> 03:14.815
<i>I got a really big
room service order</i>

03:14.817 --> 03:16.850
<i>with a really fine,
exquisite bottle of wine</i>

03:16.852 --> 03:18.486
<i>going up, you want it?</i>

03:18.488 --> 03:20.053
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Yeah, I'll look after you.

03:20.055 --> 03:21.855
You don't have
to pay for anything.

03:21.857 --> 03:24.628
Just look in the peephole
and it'll be covered.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.062
Okay. Thanks.

03:27.064 --> 03:29.668
No problem.
Bon appetit, enjoy yourself.

03:29.866 --> 03:30.802
Yep.

03:33.070 --> 03:36.674
Fucking guy!
Jenny Craig of all people.

03:48.053 --> 03:50.656
- Yes?
- Come on down, I need you here.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.088
I'm right here.

03:52.090 --> 03:53.557
Put the tray down,
get down here.

03:53.559 --> 03:55.093
I need you right now, okay?

03:55.693 --> 03:56.728
Okay.

03:57.162 --> 03:58.664
Kiss my ass.

04:00.998 --> 04:01.934
Another one.

04:31.865 --> 04:33.199
Amy, honey.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.067
Is my brother in yet?

04:35.735 --> 04:37.872
It's a little early
for your brother.

04:38.205 --> 04:39.671
You know, I love him,

04:39.673 --> 04:41.576
but you're way too soft
on your brother.

04:41.875 --> 04:44.813
If I'm gonna be soft on someone,
it's gonna be my brother.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.682
He's the only brother I got.

04:48.515 --> 04:49.484
And I love him.

05:03.665 --> 05:05.031
<i>SÃ­?</i> I mean, yes?

05:05.033 --> 05:06.899
You know, on second thought,
don't bother.

05:06.901 --> 05:08.169
It's taken care of.

05:09.037 --> 05:10.638
You don't need me anymore?

05:11.305 --> 05:12.207
Okay.

05:16.744 --> 05:17.745
Nice.

05:22.850 --> 05:25.120
Where's everything?

05:29.325 --> 05:30.058
Hello?

05:30.993 --> 05:32.560
Simon, is that you?

05:32.562 --> 05:33.794
Yeah.

05:33.796 --> 05:35.162
I'm here
at The Basement Comedy Club.

05:35.164 --> 05:37.330
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- And then they...

05:37.332 --> 05:40.200
They're going national tonight.
They want you to do a set.

05:40.202 --> 05:41.137
Tonight?

05:42.837 --> 05:45.007
I just made myself
something nice to eat.

05:46.175 --> 05:48.042
- What are they paying?
- Two hundred.

05:48.044 --> 05:50.213
Two hundred bucks?

05:50.814 --> 05:52.146
Did I not say two hundred?

05:52.148 --> 05:54.886
- And how long is this set?
- Five minutes...

05:55.785 --> 05:56.821
What am I gonna wear?

05:57.087 --> 05:58.819
<i>You know what you're gonna wear.</i>

05:58.821 --> 06:00.891
Wear what you always wear.

06:11.034 --> 06:12.767
- Hey.
- Dad, you wanted me?

06:12.769 --> 06:14.139
Come on, sit down.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.707
Listen, I want to talk to you.

06:17.709 --> 06:18.911
What did I do now?

06:20.745 --> 06:21.844
You did nothing.

06:21.846 --> 06:23.315
You know
you're a great salesman.

06:23.747 --> 06:25.113
Customers love you.

06:25.115 --> 06:26.716
I get a lot of reports,
a lot of feedback.

06:26.718 --> 06:28.017
I get lots of feedback.

06:28.019 --> 06:30.051
Your brother,
he's a good administrator.

06:30.053 --> 06:32.690
But you,
you could sell anything.

06:33.156 --> 06:36.962
Proverbial refrigerator
to an Eskimo.

06:40.666 --> 06:41.734
Dad!

06:42.200 --> 06:43.135
Dad!

06:45.404 --> 06:47.069
I just sold my first car

06:47.071 --> 06:48.874
and I totally grossed
the piss out of this idiot.

06:49.375 --> 06:50.674
Yes, he did.

06:55.880 --> 06:59.786
I just got to say, you know,
everything's got a shelf life.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.886
Including me.

07:01.888 --> 07:03.257
But I've still got
a lot of kick left.

07:03.956 --> 07:06.257
But, you know,
I'm moving towards retirement.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.362
I want to spend more time
with your mother.

07:09.728 --> 07:11.898
And this business,
it belongs to both of you.

07:12.665 --> 07:16.136
And I want you boys
to take care of the business.

07:16.703 --> 07:18.606
I want you to keep selling cars,

07:19.338 --> 07:21.372
I want your brother
to be the administrator

07:21.374 --> 07:22.507
because he's good at that.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.409
- So he'll be my boss?
- You're good at selling cars.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.647
- He's not going to be your boss.
- Simon.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.782
I will never be your boss.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.251
But I'll always be your brother.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.120
Simon,

07:33.820 --> 07:35.123
we know what you want.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.692
We know you want
to be a comedian.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.661
And you're talented.
You're funny.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.731
And I don't want to stand
in your way of that.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.330
But you always have to have
a fallback plan.

07:46.332 --> 07:49.334
A contingency plan,
in case things don't work out.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.470
And this is it.

07:50.472 --> 07:52.338
You can always come back
and sell a car.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.473
This business
will always be yours.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.244
It'll be yours...

07:56.944 --> 07:57.879
and yours.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.345
But he will be running it.

07:59.347 --> 08:02.348
He'll run it,
and you'll sell cars.

08:02.350 --> 08:03.953
Dad, you know I love you.

08:04.319 --> 08:06.386
It's your business,
you do what you want.

08:06.388 --> 08:07.821
You built this

08:07.823 --> 08:09.221
and I don't want to talk
anymore, okay?

08:09.223 --> 08:11.324
- I gotta go.
- Simon!

08:11.326 --> 08:12.228
Bro!

08:15.731 --> 08:17.166
Dad, let me go talk to him.

08:17.733 --> 08:19.235
No. No, no.

08:20.435 --> 08:22.969
No, this is not a brother
to brother thing,

08:22.971 --> 08:25.709
this is a...
father to son thing.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.344
I'm going to talk to him.

08:38.788 --> 08:40.023
Got a minute?

08:42.091 --> 08:44.092
You taking my office now?

08:44.094 --> 08:46.828
Simon! Nobody is going
to take your office.

08:46.830 --> 08:47.963
Can I sit down?

08:47.965 --> 08:49.231
It's your place.

08:49.233 --> 08:51.169
You can sit
anywhere you want, dad.

08:52.335 --> 08:54.938
I'm going to clear something up
right away.

08:55.873 --> 08:58.008
This is our place.

08:59.977 --> 09:01.112
Simon...

09:01.779 --> 09:04.249
I know what we talked about
in there hurt your feelings.

09:04.982 --> 09:06.382
But listen, son.

09:06.384 --> 09:08.854
You guys don't have any faith
or trust in me.

09:09.821 --> 09:11.423
I trust you implicitly.

09:13.091 --> 09:14.456
But somebody
has to be the driver,

09:14.458 --> 09:17.161
and you've always loved
being the passenger.

09:17.861 --> 09:18.996
And that's what you are.

09:19.264 --> 09:21.196
He's going to drive
the business.

09:21.198 --> 09:22.467
You're the passenger.

09:23.568 --> 09:25.335
You're going to sell cars,

09:25.337 --> 09:29.476
and I believe you're going
to be successful in your dream.

09:30.476 --> 09:32.044
And that's what I want.

09:32.812 --> 09:33.913
But right now...

09:35.280 --> 09:36.915
I want to give you something.

09:37.183 --> 09:38.282
It's so important.

09:38.284 --> 09:40.019
Is that my consolation prize?

09:40.419 --> 09:41.386
This...

09:42.321 --> 09:44.090
This is a vest

09:44.823 --> 09:46.258
that my father gave me.

09:47.993 --> 09:49.396
And his father gave him.

09:50.096 --> 09:51.365
It's been handed down

09:52.232 --> 09:53.932
and I think it's a lucky vest.

09:53.934 --> 09:56.136
I can't wear it anymore,
you know? But...

09:57.036 --> 09:58.071
I want you to have it.

09:59.106 --> 10:01.475
It's going to be a lucky vest
for you, Simon.

10:03.376 --> 10:04.345
It's special.

10:04.977 --> 10:06.313
This is the legacy.

10:07.314 --> 10:09.349
And when
I'm not around anymore...

10:11.318 --> 10:13.889
You're going to think of me
when you wear this,

10:14.555 --> 10:18.160
and it's going to bring you
a lot of luck.

10:19.326 --> 10:22.195
It's yours, Simon. I love you.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.168
Love you, son.

10:31.238 --> 10:34.108
They're offering you
two hundred fucking dollars.

10:35.476 --> 10:36.478
Okay.

10:38.913 --> 10:40.179
I'll be there.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.317
Now! Like now,
like five minutes ago.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.184
Okay.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.551
Okay? Don't be late.

10:45.553 --> 10:48.088
Hey, no, no. Hey, listen.
Don't be late.

11:03.172 --> 11:05.274
What the fuck?

11:07.610 --> 11:08.676
Hello?

11:08.678 --> 11:10.377
- Simon.
- Hey, William.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.015
Hey, are you coming in
today, bro?

11:13.982 --> 11:15.518
I'm sorry.
No, I'm not coming in.

11:16.251 --> 11:19.252
Got a big break tonight.
I'm going to The Comedy Basement

11:19.254 --> 11:22.259
to do a set,
and it's going to be televised.

11:23.226 --> 11:25.863
Wow, congratulations!
That's good news.

11:26.297 --> 11:27.632
Thank you, I appreciate it.

11:28.097 --> 11:29.299
Can I get a car?

11:29.632 --> 11:31.301
Simon, you know I can't do that.

11:33.304 --> 11:35.202
What the fuck, man?
We own a dealership

11:35.204 --> 11:36.672
and you won't give me a car?

11:36.674 --> 11:38.974
Every time we give you
a company car, you sell it.

11:38.976 --> 11:40.311
I'll get you a ride. Uber.

11:40.977 --> 11:43.146
Come on, man.
I don't want to go in an Uber.

11:44.178 --> 11:45.883
They all fucking smell
like curry.

11:46.350 --> 11:49.154
Simon, not every Uber driver
is from India.

11:49.420 --> 11:53.389
There are all kinds of guys:
Irish, Italian, Chinese guys!

11:54.626 --> 11:56.362
Come on, please.

11:57.295 --> 11:58.660
Tell me when you need the car,

11:58.662 --> 12:00.231
and I'll get it over there.

12:00.497 --> 12:01.432
Twenty minutes.

12:02.032 --> 12:04.435
Done. Hey, I'm proud of you.

12:04.669 --> 12:05.670
You going to come?

12:06.070 --> 12:07.238
<i>Absolutely.</i>

12:08.640 --> 12:09.605
Really?

12:09.607 --> 12:10.541
I'll be there.

12:11.444 --> 12:13.143
- Okay.
- I love you.

12:13.145 --> 12:15.148
- I'll see you tonight, bro.
- Thanks.

12:39.005 --> 12:40.540
Mr. Simon! Welcome!

12:41.407 --> 12:42.707
My brother's a fucking idiot.

12:42.709 --> 12:45.443
I am Jagdish
but you can call me Jerry.

12:45.445 --> 12:46.614
How you doing, Jerry?

12:49.249 --> 12:50.451
Easy.

13:00.227 --> 13:01.596
All buckled in, sir?

13:03.096 --> 13:04.499
I have to put my seatbelt on?

13:04.765 --> 13:06.367
That's the law, sir.

14:17.407 --> 14:19.310
How is your day going, sir?

14:19.609 --> 14:20.544
Good.

14:21.612 --> 14:26.418
By the way, do you like my car?
It's brand new.

14:28.185 --> 14:29.087
It's nice.

14:29.552 --> 14:31.455
I'm very proud of it.

14:32.790 --> 14:33.724
Nice.

14:34.391 --> 14:35.728
It's fast.

14:36.193 --> 14:37.459
Like a tiger!

14:37.461 --> 14:39.628
Can you do me a favor,
though? Can you slow it down?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.531
Because what I ate for breakfast

14:41.533 --> 14:43.735
is going to come out
of my nose and my ass.

14:44.369 --> 14:45.537
Very good, sir.

14:49.608 --> 14:52.375
What is it that you do, sir?
What is your profession?

14:55.913 --> 14:59.650
I'm a... I'm a comedian.

14:59.652 --> 15:04.224
You are telling
and writing jokes, then?

15:06.558 --> 15:08.861
I tell jokes,
I write some jokes.

15:09.361 --> 15:10.460
But I'm a comedian.

15:10.462 --> 15:12.164
So, some people sing,

15:12.365 --> 15:13.799
but they don't necessarily...

15:14.500 --> 15:15.802
write all their songs.

15:16.903 --> 15:19.438
I have never met
a joke teller before.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.142
It is an honor.

15:22.674 --> 15:24.578
Thank you, I appreciate it.

15:25.312 --> 15:28.249
Is it... a good job?

15:29.815 --> 15:33.784
It's... I guess you have
to be committed... to it.

15:33.786 --> 15:35.887
Just, I guess,
like you're committed

15:35.889 --> 15:37.254
to the job you do.

15:37.256 --> 15:38.291
I love my job.

15:38.525 --> 15:41.261
I love my job!

15:41.562 --> 15:43.394
I hope you love your job, sir.

16:00.547 --> 16:02.150
Huh. That's shit.

16:08.289 --> 16:09.358
Hey, what time is it?

16:10.324 --> 16:11.894
Start going on in ten minutes.

16:12.661 --> 16:13.630
Fuck.

16:14.964 --> 16:16.563
Fucking Simon.

16:16.565 --> 16:20.537
Please, sir. Tell me a joke.
I like to laugh.

16:20.969 --> 16:22.602
Okay.

16:22.604 --> 16:26.308
You know why blonde women
have bruised belly buttons?

16:27.743 --> 16:28.942
No.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.580
Because blonde guys
are dumb, too.

16:32.580 --> 16:35.683
I... I do not understand.

16:35.685 --> 16:37.321
Because blonde guys are dumb.

16:37.519 --> 16:39.353
They think the belly button
is the vagina,

16:39.355 --> 16:40.758
so they're tapping that.

16:42.759 --> 16:43.726
Excuse me.

16:44.961 --> 16:46.326
Hello?

16:46.328 --> 16:47.395
Simon. Where are you?

16:47.397 --> 16:49.396
I'm in an Uber, I'm on my way.

16:49.398 --> 16:50.768
Twenty-two minutes, sir.

16:51.868 --> 16:52.970
Thank you for that.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.737
Apparently it's 22 minutes.

16:55.739 --> 16:57.874
Simon, please
don't fuck this up, okay?

16:58.508 --> 16:59.611
I'm on my way.

17:01.379 --> 17:03.882
Simon? Si... Fuck.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.390
Is that your... best joke, sir?

17:14.491 --> 17:16.827
It's very good. Uh, very good.

17:17.394 --> 17:18.626
But you didn't laugh.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.828
Well, I didn't understand it,

17:20.829 --> 17:22.864
but I am new
to this country, and...

17:22.866 --> 17:24.634
Can you do me a favor
and slow down?

17:24.636 --> 17:26.502
Because I'm going to be
fucking sitting

17:26.503 --> 17:27.903
on your spare tire soon, Jerry.

17:27.905 --> 17:30.640
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a very fast car.

17:30.642 --> 17:31.941
I'm just learning how to...

17:31.943 --> 17:33.878
So maybe
you should have bought a...

17:34.413 --> 17:35.481
a Hyundai.

17:35.946 --> 17:39.284
Hyundai is a very
good car as well, but...

17:39.717 --> 17:41.853
this one is fast like a tiger.

17:56.636 --> 17:58.802
Just relax. Hey, relax.

17:58.804 --> 18:00.538
Just be honest with your
brother, he's your brother.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.643
Will you stop it,
you're fucking lame.

18:03.076 --> 18:03.977
Alright.

18:04.577 --> 18:06.443
Alright. Ooh!

18:06.445 --> 18:07.712
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

18:07.714 --> 18:09.613
- Pretty good.
- Is my brother busy?

18:09.615 --> 18:10.647
Does it matter?

18:10.649 --> 18:12.483
Even if he was,
he's always got time for you.

18:12.485 --> 18:13.617
- Go ahead.
- Appreciate it.

18:13.619 --> 18:15.555
- Can I go in?
- Yeah, of course.

18:19.892 --> 18:21.893
Look who it is!

18:21.895 --> 18:23.962
- How are you doing, bro?
- Hey, bro.

18:23.964 --> 18:26.000
What is that? Come here, you!
I love you.

18:26.766 --> 18:28.700
- Good to see you, come in!
- You too.

18:28.702 --> 18:30.635
Sally, what's up?
Hey, champ.

18:30.637 --> 18:33.474
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey.
- Come on.

18:35.377 --> 18:36.544
So.

18:37.078 --> 18:38.514
What can I do for you boys?

18:38.812 --> 18:40.049
Well, you know...

18:40.581 --> 18:41.813
I'm a little slug.

18:41.815 --> 18:43.518
I'm a little tight, and...

18:44.119 --> 18:45.685
for some scratch,

18:45.687 --> 18:47.656
and I was hoping
you could give me an advance.

18:48.156 --> 18:49.591
Simon, you know the deal.

18:49.823 --> 18:51.390
We get paid
the same every month.

18:51.392 --> 18:52.591
If I blow through my money,

18:52.593 --> 18:53.761
I don't cut myself
another check.

18:54.094 --> 18:56.428
So. But you,
you can step out on the floor

18:56.430 --> 18:57.765
any time you want,

18:58.600 --> 18:59.968
and make it happen. Listen.

19:00.602 --> 19:01.901
Get out there and sell a car,

19:01.903 --> 19:03.603
I'll give you
the commission right now.

19:03.605 --> 19:07.509
Well, thanks for seeing us
but I don't want to sell a car.

19:08.476 --> 19:10.010
Do it! Make it happen.

19:10.012 --> 19:12.044
I'm not even dressed,
I don't even have a jacket.

19:12.046 --> 19:12.981
I got you.

19:16.185 --> 19:19.755
There we go.
Wow! That is a 30 pound jacket.

19:22.123 --> 19:24.761
- Don't make me go sell a car.
- Come on, come on.

19:25.429 --> 19:27.098
This is like breathing for you.

19:27.898 --> 19:29.766
You keep my jacket
behind your door?

19:30.065 --> 19:31.035
Yeah.

19:31.935 --> 19:33.070
Go get 'em, tiger!

19:36.806 --> 19:37.908
Watch this.

19:38.175 --> 19:39.474
Watch this?
What are you talking about?

19:39.476 --> 19:40.742
He's my best friend.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.944
He's going to come back here
in two seconds with a contract.

19:42.946 --> 19:44.548
Watch it.

19:45.782 --> 19:47.182
Good afternoon, how are you?

19:47.184 --> 19:49.150
- Good, thanks. How are you?
- My name is Simon.

19:49.152 --> 19:51.922
- Hi, Bernard.
- Good to meet you, Bernard.

19:53.658 --> 19:56.191
Call me Bernie.
I'm just looking around.

19:56.193 --> 19:57.592
Bernie?

19:57.594 --> 19:58.660
I'll just tell you
about the car,

19:58.662 --> 19:59.762
because that's my job.

19:59.764 --> 20:01.063
- Sure.
- You like the car?

20:01.065 --> 20:02.098
I like it, yeah.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.265
You know, Bernie,
I have to tell you something.

20:03.267 --> 20:05.700
When they say they don't make
them like they used to...

20:05.702 --> 20:06.901
Thank God,
because they used to be

20:06.903 --> 20:08.236
a pile of shit.

20:08.238 --> 20:10.940
This is a car.
The highest level of technology,

20:10.942 --> 20:13.243
the software synchs up
with your phone,

20:13.245 --> 20:14.914
whether it's Apple or Android.

20:15.146 --> 20:17.546
All wheel drive, 2000 CCs,

20:17.548 --> 20:19.783
it's an equal boost engine,
it's great on gas.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.116
This is a quick car.

20:21.118 --> 20:22.818
- Yeah. It's nice.
- And look at the back seat.

20:22.820 --> 20:24.688
If you want to bang a chick
in the back seat,

20:24.690 --> 20:26.122
you ain't going to break
a vertebrae.

20:26.124 --> 20:29.926
I'm married,
but thanks for the info.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.064
Take the wife in the back seat.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.964
- Do you love the car?
- I do, yeah.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.700
Can I make a suggestion, Bernie?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.901
- Sure.
- Let's go in my office and talk.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.039
- What do you think?
- Okay, Simon.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.009
Thanks.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.713
- Bernie, come in please.
- Yeah.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.050
- Sit down, buddy.
- Thanks.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.722
Bernie.

20:57.656 --> 20:58.990
I was born into this business.

20:58.992 --> 21:00.858
It's my dad
that started this business,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.129
he started as a salesman.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.598
I'm talking to you
like a brother.

21:04.798 --> 21:06.131
The car... Do you love that car?

21:06.133 --> 21:07.932
I love that car.
It's a lovely car.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.268
...fits your perfectly.

21:09.270 --> 21:11.135
- A car's got to fit you, buddy.
- Yep.

21:11.137 --> 21:13.805
It's got a 2000 CC
equal boost engine,

21:13.807 --> 21:15.140
it's good on gas.

21:15.142 --> 21:16.240
It's not a dog.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.812
Because most of these cars
that are fuel-efficient

21:19.078 --> 21:21.012
you have to get out
and fucking push.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.615
But... here's the problem.

21:23.617 --> 21:24.752
If you don't take this car,

21:25.886 --> 21:28.587
and they sell it, it's six,
eight, maybe ten weeks.

21:28.589 --> 21:31.156
Almost a whole model year.
And I won't go back and forth.

21:31.158 --> 21:33.159
I'm going to give you
the best deal possible,

21:33.161 --> 21:34.560
first time.

21:34.562 --> 21:36.296
Make the deal,
and then you can pick it up.

21:36.298 --> 21:37.997
I can have it PDI'd

21:37.999 --> 21:40.769
and out of the showroom
by tomorrow.

21:43.704 --> 21:45.137
No, not at all.

21:45.139 --> 21:48.077
No, I'm going to have to check
with my wife, you know?

21:50.679 --> 21:51.745
I respect that.

21:51.747 --> 21:53.981
Second largest investment
of your life is your car.

21:53.983 --> 21:55.816
- Yeah, right.
- I'm on your side, Bernie.

21:55.818 --> 21:58.618
And you'll probably try
to bang her in the back seat,

21:58.620 --> 22:00.119
like you said.

22:00.121 --> 22:01.588
There's lots of room.
Nothing like romance.

22:01.590 --> 22:02.889
This is what I'm going to do.

22:02.891 --> 22:04.357
I want to hold the car for you.

22:04.359 --> 22:06.760
So, there's a little box here
where it says remarks,

22:06.762 --> 22:08.865
I'm going to put "Must...

22:09.999 --> 22:10.932
ask...

22:10.934 --> 22:12.936
wife's...

22:13.669 --> 22:14.772
permission...

22:16.005 --> 22:17.140
to buy...

22:17.773 --> 22:18.906
the car."

22:18.908 --> 22:21.778
If she gives you the go-ahead,
then we take this off.

22:22.012 --> 22:23.677
Give me the fucking paperwork.

22:23.679 --> 22:25.614
Nobody tells me
whether I can buy a car or not.

22:25.616 --> 22:27.081
You're a good boy, Bernie.

22:36.793 --> 22:37.929
Thank you!

22:38.696 --> 22:39.932
Thank you, thank you!

22:41.632 --> 22:42.734
Thank you.

22:43.801 --> 22:44.937
Thank you!

22:45.703 --> 22:47.235
Welcome to The Comedy Basement.

22:47.237 --> 22:49.739
And remember, when you're here,
in The Comedy Basement,

22:49.741 --> 22:51.974
there is only one place
left to go,

22:51.976 --> 22:53.309
and that is up!

22:56.046 --> 22:57.848
My name is Freddy C.

22:58.082 --> 23:01.184
I am your host and the owner
of this beautiful establishment.

23:01.186 --> 23:03.256
My first guest

23:04.023 --> 23:06.389
is an up-and-comer,
he's known all around the area,

23:06.391 --> 23:08.824
we're very honored to have,
ladies and gentlemen,

23:08.826 --> 23:10.394
he's no longer driving
for NASCAR,

23:10.396 --> 23:11.427
Mr. Jeff Elliott!

23:23.142 --> 23:25.612
Hey, guys. How's it going?

23:26.145 --> 23:28.615
Alright. I'm really starting
to feel my age.

23:29.015 --> 23:30.651
I hurt myself sleeping.

23:33.152 --> 23:34.985
Did you know that was a thing
you could do?

23:34.987 --> 23:36.090
I was taking a nap.

23:36.422 --> 23:38.891
I woke up,
my shoulder was really sore.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.893
Doesn't go away for two weeks.

23:41.428 --> 23:43.127
So I go to the doctor,
they take some X-rays.

23:43.129 --> 23:45.196
Ah... turns out I tore
my rotator cuff...

23:45.198 --> 23:46.397
Aw.

23:46.399 --> 23:48.300
...while I was taking a nap!

23:50.871 --> 23:52.304
If you guys are familiar
with this injury,

23:52.306 --> 23:54.308
it's usually reserved
for professional athletes.

23:55.075 --> 23:56.909
Most specifically,
baseball pitchers

23:56.911 --> 23:58.647
tear their rotator cuffs a lot.

23:58.879 --> 24:00.281
I knew I was good at sleeping.

24:02.383 --> 24:04.652
Apparently I'm ready
for the big leagues!

24:05.318 --> 24:07.186
I'll say this too,
these baseball pitchers

24:07.188 --> 24:08.419
tear their rotator cuffs,
they're done.

24:08.421 --> 24:10.893
For a year,
they don't play baseball.

24:11.393 --> 24:13.860
I was back in bed
sleeping that night.

24:21.036 --> 24:24.036
My next guest
is the most famous sock

24:24.038 --> 24:25.471
in the entire world!

24:25.473 --> 24:27.439
Unlike his brother
who never quite made it.

24:27.441 --> 24:30.008
He's the sock that's still
left out on the highway.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.244
Ah...

24:31.246 --> 24:32.946
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ed the Sock!

24:39.055 --> 24:40.824
Alright, shut up already!

24:41.190 --> 24:42.922
I don't believe your sincerity.

24:42.924 --> 24:44.391
Thank you very much
for that introduction.

24:44.393 --> 24:47.995
I love the goatee, by the way.
Very Wesley Snipes.

24:49.397 --> 24:52.133
And thank you
for the reference to my brother

24:52.135 --> 24:53.470
who's out on the highway.

24:54.737 --> 24:57.138
I haven't heard that one before.
Though, of course, it's better

24:57.140 --> 25:01.012
than the "brother that you
jerked off into as a teenager."

25:03.347 --> 25:05.079
Guys! I'm a sock!

25:05.081 --> 25:07.315
That's my ethnicity.
I'm not defined by it.

25:07.317 --> 25:09.017
Let's get past
those jokes, okay?

25:11.387 --> 25:12.456
Our next act...

25:12.889 --> 25:14.489
We love seeing this man
when he comes

25:14.491 --> 25:16.057
and garners our stage,

25:16.059 --> 25:19.059
That Canadian guy...
Glen Foster!

25:21.097 --> 25:23.234
Alright, come on, come on...

25:27.437 --> 25:30.975
Here we go. Oh, thank you
very much. That's very nice.

25:31.542 --> 25:33.475
I hope I look alright. I, uh...

25:33.477 --> 25:36.412
I've reached the age
where no matter what I wear,

25:36.414 --> 25:39.248
I just come off
looking like a retired cop.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.053
So...

25:41.351 --> 25:44.252
Anyway, I do not need
any more stress in my life.

25:44.254 --> 25:47.124
I live
with my pre-teen daughter,

25:47.126 --> 25:49.859
- Oh!
- my pre-menopausal wife,

25:51.397 --> 25:56.266
and... a previously abused
female Australian Shepherd.

25:56.268 --> 25:58.268
Oh, yeah!

25:58.270 --> 26:00.236
There are days
I walk through the door,

26:00.238 --> 26:02.873
it is bitch, bitch, bitch.

26:05.845 --> 26:09.011
But the dog is cute, so...

26:11.150 --> 26:12.216
I'll give you
another joke.

26:12.218 --> 26:16.053
So this guy is in his room.
He's in a hospital.

26:16.055 --> 26:16.989
And...

26:16.991 --> 26:19.022
the doctor comes in the room,
and he says,

26:19.024 --> 26:21.592
"Mr. Smith,
I got some good news,

26:21.594 --> 26:23.127
and some bad news."

26:23.129 --> 26:26.196
So he says,
"Give me the bad news first

26:26.198 --> 26:29.202
and then you can pacify me
with the good news."

26:29.535 --> 26:30.902
Goes, "Well, the bad news is

26:30.904 --> 26:32.169
you got gangrene
on both your feet,

26:32.171 --> 26:33.437
we're going to have
to cut them off."

26:33.439 --> 26:34.575
"So what the fuck's
the good news?"

26:35.309 --> 26:38.180
"The guy in the other room
wants to buy all your shoes."

26:39.246 --> 26:42.082
Because they wear the same...
they wear the same size.

26:42.984 --> 26:44.151
And, and then?

26:45.553 --> 26:47.285
Oh, that is it?

26:47.287 --> 26:49.388
I got to check my messages
because you're depressing me.

26:49.390 --> 26:50.492
Okay? Anyways.

26:51.592 --> 26:53.591
They're very good jokes, sir.
Very good. But, I...

26:53.593 --> 26:56.328
- Apparently not.
- I've never heard them before.

26:56.330 --> 26:59.565
I would love to study your jokes
so I understand them.

26:59.567 --> 27:02.070
If you have to study a joke,
it's not funny.

27:04.506 --> 27:06.939
Now our next act
is known all around the world

27:06.941 --> 27:08.207
as your neighborhood kid.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.075
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up

27:10.077 --> 27:11.244
for Jerry Caringi!

27:12.948 --> 27:16.216
Yeah! What's going on
here? What's going on?

27:16.218 --> 27:18.254
Hey! Pasta fazool, how are you?

27:18.687 --> 27:20.957
Hey, how are you?
Good to see you.

27:21.390 --> 27:25.062
Hey! <i>Faccia di polenta!</i>
How are you?

27:25.561 --> 27:26.964
How are you, man?

27:29.164 --> 27:30.499
How are you doing, huh?

27:34.938 --> 27:36.907
What a crowd, what a crowd!

27:37.507 --> 27:40.006
- You feeling good?
- Yeah!

27:40.008 --> 27:41.309
Ay!

27:41.311 --> 27:43.013
<i>Faccia di polenta,</i> how are you?

27:43.211 --> 27:46.148
Anyways, um... <i>The Godfather.</i>

27:47.116 --> 27:48.683
It's getting serious.
He's in his office.

27:48.685 --> 27:50.020
Something is going on.

27:50.386 --> 27:52.990
So he calls in Rocco.
"Rocco, get in here!

27:53.723 --> 27:55.259
I gotta ask you a question."

27:56.125 --> 27:57.427
"Yes, Godfather. Anything."

27:58.295 --> 27:59.663
"What's five plus five?"

28:00.396 --> 28:03.265
Rocco answers, "Seven."

28:04.300 --> 28:05.936
Godfather slaps him in the face.

28:06.537 --> 28:09.204
"You're a good boy.
You're very smart.

28:09.206 --> 28:11.641
Thank you. Go get Anthony.
Send him in here.

28:11.643 --> 28:12.510
Stay outside."

28:13.644 --> 28:16.214
Anthony comes waltzing in,
kind of worried.

28:18.316 --> 28:20.552
Godfather asks Anthony,
"Anthony...

28:21.318 --> 28:24.289
I'm going to ask you a question.
Give me a straight answer.

28:24.588 --> 28:25.721
Are you ready?"

28:25.723 --> 28:27.122
Anthony goes, "Yeah."

28:27.124 --> 28:28.324
"What's five plus six?"

28:28.326 --> 28:30.395
"Ah, that's easy. It's eleven."

28:31.596 --> 28:33.563
Pulls out his gun, bang!

28:34.500 --> 28:36.169
Falls to the floor! Ba da dum!

28:36.602 --> 28:39.502
Rocco comes running in,
"Godfather! What's going on?

28:39.504 --> 28:40.572
What did you do?"

28:42.607 --> 28:43.640
"He knows too much."

28:43.642 --> 28:45.342
Oh!

28:45.344 --> 28:48.112
This woman has been known
all around the world

28:48.114 --> 28:50.279
for her role on <i>Growing Pains.</i>

28:50.281 --> 28:52.348
She also garnered the cover,

28:52.350 --> 28:57.121
and throughout America
is known as a stunning Playmate

28:57.123 --> 28:58.455
in <i>Playboy</i> magazine.

28:58.457 --> 29:00.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up for...

29:00.793 --> 29:02.292
Julie McCollough!

29:12.305 --> 29:13.637
How y'all doing?

29:16.342 --> 29:18.609
Thank you so very, very much
for having me here.

29:18.611 --> 29:21.413
I've lived all over
the United States, y'all.

29:21.415 --> 29:24.183
I've lived in North Carolina,
West by God Virginia,

29:24.185 --> 29:28.220
Florida, Louisiana,
Missouri, Nevada,

29:28.222 --> 29:30.492
Texas... Woo hoo for Texas!

29:31.358 --> 29:35.196
California, and I was born
in Hawaii. Woo hoo!

29:36.364 --> 29:38.263
Y'all could tell
I was Hawaiian, right?

29:38.265 --> 29:42.068
Blonde hair, Southern accent...
Dead giveaway, she's Hawaiian!

29:47.309 --> 29:49.809
- brothers.
- Whoo!

29:52.080 --> 29:54.246
Ooh!

29:54.248 --> 29:55.848
That means absolutely nothing.

29:57.386 --> 29:59.155
Now, our next guest...

29:59.588 --> 30:03.426
He can tell jokes, he's funny,
he can sing, but please...

30:03.692 --> 30:06.760
do not get him to dance
up here right now.

30:08.296 --> 30:09.631
Ladies and gentlemen,
Constantine Meglis!

30:20.142 --> 30:21.809
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

30:21.811 --> 30:23.080
How are you?

30:23.279 --> 30:25.416
I happen to be six foot nine.

30:25.614 --> 30:26.614
Ooh!

30:26.616 --> 30:30.150
That's not... tall,
that's like monster tall.

30:31.187 --> 30:32.456
Okay?

30:33.156 --> 30:34.759
Even when I was a little kid.

30:35.292 --> 30:36.828
My kindergarten picture...

30:38.228 --> 30:40.765
I'm five years old,
just like the rest of the kids.

30:41.232 --> 30:42.801
I look like I'm the teacher.

30:47.403 --> 30:49.471
Sir, you are too hard
on your jokes.

30:49.473 --> 30:52.241
I'm sure people who understand
them will find them funny.

30:52.243 --> 30:53.678
I just don't understand them.

30:54.544 --> 30:55.447
Okay.

30:56.313 --> 30:58.717
Are you going to give
a show tonight?

31:01.753 --> 31:02.855
Well, I'm...

31:03.354 --> 31:05.588
I'm part of a show,
because it's a...

31:05.590 --> 31:09.324
it's a bunch of comedians,
it's like a cavalcade,

31:09.326 --> 31:11.463
and it's being televised
on cable.

31:11.862 --> 31:15.331
Oh, my God!
That sounds very impressive.

31:15.333 --> 31:17.202
I wish I could attend.

31:17.401 --> 31:20.472
But I must drive my car.

31:20.872 --> 31:23.610
Are you... excited, sir?

31:25.377 --> 31:26.579
I wouldn't say...

31:27.446 --> 31:28.613
I'm excited, but...

31:30.650 --> 31:35.255
I'm probably, I would say,
relieved, because if I do good,

31:35.488 --> 31:38.658
this is basically
the break I'm looking for.

31:38.924 --> 31:40.392
If I do bad,

31:40.625 --> 31:42.895
I'll be selling cars
for the rest of my life.

31:43.629 --> 31:47.468
Oh, my God. So it's
a very important event, then.

31:48.367 --> 31:50.337
Yeah, you could say that. Yeah.

31:50.804 --> 31:55.176
I'm wishing you
most excellent good luck, sir.

31:55.675 --> 31:57.241
Most excellent
good luck?

31:57.243 --> 31:58.478
Most excellent
good luck.

31:58.945 --> 32:03.517
Well I most excellently
appreciate your wishes.

32:03.849 --> 32:07.251
And I hope they're true for me
and for my sake.

32:07.253 --> 32:10.791
And congratulations on your car,
which is a tiger...

32:11.326 --> 32:12.594
uh, in heat.

32:12.827 --> 32:15.928
That joke I understand, sir.

32:17.664 --> 32:19.401
"Tiger in heat" you found funny?

32:19.901 --> 32:21.933
Well a tiger in heat
would be very funny.

32:21.935 --> 32:26.305
Uh, dangerous, but I see
how you make it funny.

32:26.307 --> 32:28.410
You... you are good comedian.

32:29.978 --> 32:31.279
Okay.

32:35.651 --> 32:38.821
Any ladies here
considering breast implants?

32:39.288 --> 32:40.554
- No!
- Yes!

32:40.556 --> 32:42.422
Any guys here considering
their ladies

32:42.424 --> 32:43.824
should have breast implants?

32:45.327 --> 32:46.593
Hey, here's the thing, ladies.

32:46.595 --> 32:47.861
If you're with a guy
who wants you

32:47.863 --> 32:50.700
to get a breast implant,
get rid of him!

32:51.834 --> 32:54.804
The best breast enlargement
is sit closer!

32:59.376 --> 33:02.676
Honestly, a breast enlargement
that a guy wants you to have,

33:02.678 --> 33:05.046
it's only because he can't get
his penis made bigger.

33:05.048 --> 33:06.817
Oh!

33:09.519 --> 33:11.019
I am trying to take
care of myself,

33:11.021 --> 33:12.720
'cause I'm a single guy.

33:12.722 --> 33:14.489
Trying to figure out what women
find attractive in a man.

33:14.491 --> 33:16.457
I think I have some things.
I don't know if you've noticed,

33:16.459 --> 33:17.695
but my hands...

33:18.528 --> 33:19.827
are pretty much gorgeous.

33:19.829 --> 33:22.697
I take good care of them.

33:22.699 --> 33:23.932
I've been told women look
at your hands

33:23.934 --> 33:25.501
when they first meet you.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.405
They also look at your eyes,
I've been told.

33:27.605 --> 33:28.904
I've got some sweet baby blues

33:28.906 --> 33:30.606
happening behind
these safety goggles.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.076
And I've heard feet before,
which I didn't understand.

33:34.078 --> 33:34.710
That sounds gross.

33:34.712 --> 33:36.645
Who looks at a man's feet?

33:36.647 --> 33:39.347
It's a size thing, right?
They think you got big shoes,

33:39.349 --> 33:40.848
you got the...

33:42.019 --> 33:43.521
...big underpants, right?

33:44.522 --> 33:45.589
Mine are a size 11.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.457
That is slightly above average.

33:50.494 --> 33:51.961
They're 11 wide, actually.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.766
Whoa!

33:55.033 --> 33:57.767
Can barely get my gorgeous hands
around the thing.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.040
So, do you have...
all your friends and family

34:05.042 --> 34:07.780
coming to see
your performance tonight?

34:08.612 --> 34:09.678
Sure you going the right way?

34:09.679 --> 34:11.752
It's faster, sir. Much faster.

34:12.518 --> 34:14.521
- You sure?
- Very sure.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.121
I don't know
if my family's coming.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.688
I mean...

34:18.690 --> 34:21.791
My father and my mother
are no longer here,

34:21.793 --> 34:23.060
- unfortunately.
- I'm very sorry, sir.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.929
And I have a brother,
and he's married.

34:25.931 --> 34:28.067
And... that's us.

34:28.701 --> 34:30.469
So hopefully he'll...

34:31.536 --> 34:32.936
My brother will come tonight.

34:54.695 --> 34:57.562
Come on, mom's waiting.
Let's go say goodbye.

34:57.564 --> 35:00.002
I can't go. I... I can't do it.

35:03.004 --> 35:03.939
Simon.

35:04.873 --> 35:07.139
Let's go upstairs
and say goodbye to mom.

35:07.141 --> 35:08.643
I don't want to say bye.

35:10.011 --> 35:10.978
You've got to do it.

35:12.547 --> 35:13.582
Hey.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.917
You weren't there when dad died.

35:16.151 --> 35:17.585
He was waiting for you.

35:17.785 --> 35:19.120
Don't make the same mistake.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.888
Why would you say that?

35:21.589 --> 35:23.059
He wanted to say goodbye to you.

35:23.858 --> 35:25.427
I know you regretted that.

35:26.061 --> 35:28.664
Let's go, don't make
the same mistake. Come on!

35:29.498 --> 35:30.697
That's it, there. Let's go.

35:59.662 --> 36:01.765
Can you give us
a moment, please?

36:11.175 --> 36:14.112
Simon? There's a line
up at the gates of heaven.

36:14.712 --> 36:16.947
Why are you keeping me
waiting, my son?

36:18.882 --> 36:22.654
You've tried all your life
to make people laugh.

36:23.721 --> 36:26.123
And you always
make yourself cry.

36:26.858 --> 36:29.060
Why are you so sad, my son?

36:39.805 --> 36:42.538
And what about your wife, sir?

36:42.540 --> 36:44.109
Are you married?

36:44.709 --> 36:46.812
- I'm not married, no.
- Ah.

36:47.812 --> 36:49.881
Have you ever been married?

36:50.249 --> 36:52.015
Jerry, It's tough enough

36:52.017 --> 36:54.017
to get along with yourself,
let alone with somebody else.

36:54.019 --> 36:54.953
No, I've...

36:55.687 --> 36:56.923
never been married.

36:58.625 --> 36:59.760
That is sad.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.029
A man needs to be married.

37:02.695 --> 37:03.897
Why, to be miserable?

37:05.063 --> 37:09.569
Hm... you have not found
the right woman yet, I suppose.

37:09.869 --> 37:11.101
Do they call you Jerry

37:11.103 --> 37:12.769
'cause you're like
Jerry Springer?

37:12.771 --> 37:14.641
Who is that?

37:14.873 --> 37:16.641
It's not important.

37:16.643 --> 37:18.775
You know what? Everybody finds
their own happiness, Jerry.

37:18.777 --> 37:21.814
I'm happy in my... in my...

37:23.182 --> 37:26.920
survival of life.
I'm okay. I'm good.

37:28.155 --> 37:29.591
Yes, I understand.

37:30.090 --> 37:32.593
I was very happy
with my Sharmila.

37:34.093 --> 37:36.063
She's not with us
anymore, but...

37:36.829 --> 37:38.632
I still talk to her every day.

37:41.869 --> 37:43.671
I have got to take this,
Jerry, okay?

37:44.004 --> 37:45.139
Of course, sir.

37:45.940 --> 37:47.007
Hello?

37:47.009 --> 37:49.074
Si... Wha... What the fuck
are you doing, Simon?

37:49.076 --> 37:51.746
You know what? I don't know
if I want to do this. I...

37:52.047 --> 37:54.148
I don't want
to embarrass myself. I...

37:55.116 --> 37:57.349
This is a... I guess
this is a big leap for me,

37:57.351 --> 37:58.351
and I don't think I...

37:58.353 --> 38:00.186
I don't think I want to do it.

38:00.188 --> 38:01.587
What are you
fucking talking about?

38:01.589 --> 38:04.223
I put my fucking balls
on the line for you.

38:04.225 --> 38:05.824
But you told me they wanted me,

38:05.826 --> 38:09.128
why are you telling me
that it's your ass?

38:09.130 --> 38:09.695
I don't understand.

38:09.697 --> 38:10.830
Of course they want you!

38:10.832 --> 38:13.367
But I still had to put
my fucking balls on the line.

38:13.369 --> 38:14.501
You know, credibility!

38:14.503 --> 38:16.303
<i>I'm the guy
who fucking recommended you.</i>

38:16.305 --> 38:17.870
<i>What's the matter with you?
They want you!</i>

38:17.872 --> 38:18.972
Stop screaming
in my fucking ear.

38:18.974 --> 38:20.307
<i>Don't fucking do this to me.</i>

38:20.309 --> 38:21.941
<i>Don't fucking do this
to yourself.</i>

38:21.943 --> 38:23.309
<i>Get over here.
What the fuck are you doing?</i>

38:23.311 --> 38:25.314
Okay.

38:26.148 --> 38:28.716
Sometimes I feel
like I'm married to you, Sally.

38:28.718 --> 38:31.087
Okay. I'll do it.
We're on our way.

38:31.387 --> 38:33.189
Fuck!

38:58.115 --> 39:00.950
- Hey, Simon!
- Hey. Did you bring some money?

39:00.952 --> 39:02.354
- Of course I did.
- Good.

39:02.854 --> 39:04.720
So tonight
you know what I'm thinking?

39:04.722 --> 39:06.691
I want you to play
the deaf-mute.

39:07.758 --> 39:09.425
I don't want to play
the deaf-mute.

39:09.427 --> 39:10.959
You fucked it up already

39:10.961 --> 39:12.764
at playing the deaf-mute.

39:42.294 --> 39:43.759
Hey, Garry.

39:43.761 --> 39:45.127
Hey, Simon, what's going on?

39:45.129 --> 39:47.231
Give me a scotch
with a couple of cubes, please.

39:47.233 --> 39:48.268
Sure.

39:49.402 --> 39:52.271
What do you... want to... drink?

39:56.409 --> 39:57.744
You sure?

39:58.811 --> 40:00.748
- Beer, for my buddy.
- Sure.

40:11.325 --> 40:12.292
Good?

40:14.428 --> 40:15.763
How you doing?

40:17.430 --> 40:19.867
I, ah...
I speak sign language.

40:20.334 --> 40:23.000
That isn't anything
that I recognize.

40:23.002 --> 40:24.171
You know why?

40:24.504 --> 40:26.307
'Cause we're speaking dialect.

40:27.908 --> 40:30.011
Oh.

40:30.410 --> 40:31.378
Ok.

40:40.121 --> 40:42.088
This is my favorite restaurant
in the whole world.

40:42.090 --> 40:45.461
I love this place.
The food is absolutely amazing.

40:45.994 --> 40:47.360
Well, you know why I come here?

40:47.362 --> 40:49.898
The waiter.
He's like a father to me. Jack!

40:50.931 --> 40:52.067
Buddy, we're ready.

40:54.969 --> 40:56.705
Your favorite wine, Simon?

40:56.904 --> 40:57.840
Absolutely.

40:58.207 --> 41:00.173
It's my favorite
restaurant, I...

41:00.175 --> 41:01.941
I come here all the time
and I love the waiter.

41:01.943 --> 41:04.511
He's like a... father to me.

41:04.513 --> 41:06.147
Jack?

41:06.149 --> 41:08.015
This is my favorite restaurant
in the whole world.

41:08.017 --> 41:09.319
I love this place.

41:09.986 --> 41:11.922
And... the waiter

41:12.789 --> 41:14.925
is like a dad to me. Jack!

41:15.358 --> 41:16.892
We're ready, buddy.

41:17.859 --> 41:19.162
Your favorite wine, Simon?

41:23.534 --> 41:25.470
- Miss?
- Please.

41:26.002 --> 41:27.002
Thank you.

41:28.806 --> 41:30.806
- Ma'am?
- Please.

41:32.342 --> 41:33.474
Pinello!

41:33.476 --> 41:35.210
You spoil me, Simon.

41:35.212 --> 41:37.148
- Miss?
- Yes, please.

41:41.851 --> 41:43.254
Do you mind if I order for us?

41:43.821 --> 41:45.320
Ah... nope. Thank you.

41:45.322 --> 41:47.356
We're not going to need
the menus. I know exactly...

41:47.358 --> 41:49.959
- Do you mind if I order for us?
- Not at all.

41:49.961 --> 41:51.796
- Do you mind if I order?
- No.

41:52.229 --> 41:54.296
We're going to have
the filet mignon,

41:54.298 --> 41:55.399
the lobster tail,

41:56.099 --> 41:58.002
and I want them
to make the angel hair...

41:58.369 --> 42:01.003
like they do for me,
<i>alla puttanesca.</i>

42:01.005 --> 42:02.370
Please? Thank you.

42:02.372 --> 42:04.976
So we're going to have
the filet mignon,

42:05.242 --> 42:06.943
with the lobster.

42:06.945 --> 42:09.314
We'll have the angel hair pasta
<i>alla puttanesca.</i>

42:09.915 --> 42:11.384
Ok? Thank you.

42:11.884 --> 42:13.984
We're going to have
the filet mignon,

42:13.986 --> 42:15.319
the lobster tail,

42:15.321 --> 42:18.589
and can you make that angel hair
<i>alla puttanesca,</i> please?

42:18.591 --> 42:20.125
- Of course.
- Thank you.

42:21.861 --> 42:23.263
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:26.531 --> 42:27.897
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:27.899 --> 42:29.199
Thanks for coming out tonight.

42:29.201 --> 42:30.969
Thanks for having me.

42:44.450 --> 42:47.050
Do you mind? I've got
to make a quick call outside.

42:47.052 --> 42:48.586
- I'll be right back.
- No problem.

42:48.588 --> 42:50.954
I'm going to make a quick call.
Do you mind?

42:50.956 --> 42:52.457
Not at all. Take your time.

42:52.459 --> 42:54.425
I gotta make a quick call,
if you don't mind.

42:54.427 --> 42:55.894
- Is that ok with you?
- Mm-hm.

42:55.896 --> 42:56.894
- Sure.
- Be right back.

42:56.896 --> 42:57.897
Everything's good?

42:57.899 --> 42:59.034
- Amazing.
- Good.

42:59.901 --> 43:01.069
Give me a sec.

43:02.469 --> 43:03.437
I'll be right back.

43:05.973 --> 43:07.209
Be back in a second.

43:20.053 --> 43:21.453
Is everything alright?

43:21.455 --> 43:23.423
Everything's amazing, but...
Jack, where's Simon?

43:23.425 --> 43:25.525
He was making a call.
It's been a while...

43:25.527 --> 43:26.992
Is everything alright?

43:26.994 --> 43:28.463
Yes, excellent...

43:32.034 --> 43:33.266
Is everything alright?

43:33.268 --> 43:35.170
Mm, delicious, thank you.

43:40.474 --> 43:41.509
Where's Simon?

43:42.043 --> 43:43.311
Is he coming back?

43:43.679 --> 43:44.981
Nah.

43:48.551 --> 43:50.283
Motherfucker!

43:50.285 --> 43:53.222
What a scumbag!

43:54.089 --> 43:56.022
I'll fucking scratch
his eyeballs out

43:56.024 --> 43:57.223
the next time I see him!

44:13.009 --> 44:14.509
Simon, you ok?

44:14.511 --> 44:16.179
Yeah, I'm good. Listen...

44:16.646 --> 44:19.380
First of all, thank you
for the way you take care of me,

44:19.382 --> 44:20.414
I appreciate it.

44:20.416 --> 44:22.085
Anything for you.
It's ok, Simon.

44:22.453 --> 44:25.387
That last girl,
I think her name was Margaret...

44:25.389 --> 44:26.121
Yeah.

44:26.123 --> 44:28.259
How did she take
paying the bill?

44:28.592 --> 44:30.161
Well...

44:30.427 --> 44:32.597
When she saw the bill,
she started laughing.

44:41.006 --> 44:42.241
Ok...

44:45.243 --> 44:47.243
Get the fuck outta here.
She started laughing?

44:47.245 --> 44:49.011
Yeah, she was laughing.

44:49.013 --> 44:50.381
Did she call me any names?

44:51.115 --> 44:52.617
No.

44:53.417 --> 44:54.519
Really?

44:55.220 --> 44:56.519
Ok, thanks buddy.

44:56.521 --> 44:58.121
I appreciate it.
I'll see you soon.

44:58.123 --> 45:00.092
- Ok?
- It's ok. Anything, Simon.

45:12.438 --> 45:13.440
Hello?

45:13.773 --> 45:15.608
Um... Margaret?

45:16.741 --> 45:18.544
It's Simon.

45:19.811 --> 45:22.148
Wow, ah...

45:22.716 --> 45:24.381
I'm surprised.

45:24.383 --> 45:26.051
I honestly didn't think
I would hear from you again.

45:26.053 --> 45:28.321
I really... I'm sorry
I had to leave, something...

45:28.655 --> 45:31.589
came up and I couldn't get out
of it, and I apologize.

45:31.591 --> 45:32.557
Ah-ha.

45:32.559 --> 45:34.426
I'd like to make it up to you,
if possible.

45:34.428 --> 45:36.564
Could I take you out again?

45:38.365 --> 45:41.369
You... you want me
to buy you dinner again?

45:42.602 --> 45:47.442
No, no. I want to make it up
to you, and I got a big...

45:48.109 --> 45:49.708
I got a big
thing going on tonight,

45:49.710 --> 45:51.810
I'm performing
at The Comedy Basement.

45:51.812 --> 45:55.249
<i>It's being televised on cable.</i>

45:55.850 --> 45:57.750
And if you come...
If you can make it tonight,

45:57.752 --> 46:00.589
I'd appreciate it,
and I'll make it up to you.

46:02.656 --> 46:04.191
Ah...

46:06.326 --> 46:08.696
Let me think about it.

46:10.164 --> 46:11.363
Ok.

46:11.365 --> 46:12.765
Sorry about it, really.

46:12.767 --> 46:14.771
I'm sorry about it,
I'll make it up to you. Ok?

46:15.369 --> 46:17.239
- It's ok.
- <i>Try to make it tonight.</i>

46:18.139 --> 46:19.374
- Ok.
- Bye.

46:19.641 --> 46:21.144
- Bye.
- Bye.

46:28.650 --> 46:30.517
My daddy's
a hillbilly coal miner

46:30.519 --> 46:32.385
from West by God Virginia.

46:32.387 --> 46:34.187
So I'm a coal miner's daughter.

46:35.859 --> 46:37.525
He was a Marine,

46:37.527 --> 46:40.464
he was in the United States
Marine Corps, so oorah!

46:40.730 --> 46:42.496
- Yeah!
- Oorah!

46:42.498 --> 46:45.665
My mama, she worked in a church
in Durham, North Carolina.

46:45.667 --> 46:48.668
So naturally,
I am a <i>Playboy</i> Playmate.

46:52.475 --> 46:54.678
True, I am Miss February...

46:55.178 --> 46:56.747
Whoo!

46:58.682 --> 47:00.349
...1986.

47:02.552 --> 47:04.253
I frickin' hate
saying that year,

47:04.255 --> 47:05.523
it's a dead giveaway.

47:06.590 --> 47:09.760
I'm old... erish.

47:10.728 --> 47:14.162
I'm 33 years in Playmate years!
Whoo hoo!

47:18.434 --> 47:21.837
Any guys here who like to send
pictures of their penises

47:21.839 --> 47:23.741
to prospective dates?

47:24.942 --> 47:26.843
Good, I'm glad nobody clapped.

47:28.479 --> 47:30.582
'Cause I know
most of you are liars,

47:31.415 --> 47:32.748
but at least you have
the common sense

47:32.750 --> 47:34.850
not to admit it
in a crowd of people.

47:36.520 --> 47:38.788
Not quite sure why a guy
would send a penis to a woman.

47:38.790 --> 47:42.192
Is it like they hope
that later during the date

47:42.194 --> 47:43.625
they can't be impersonated?

47:45.398 --> 47:48.199
Like, "Wait a minute,
I've seen your penis,

47:48.201 --> 47:50.469
and that's not your penis!"

47:52.505 --> 47:54.338
I just don't understand it.

47:54.340 --> 47:57.474
Women don't go for guys
for a penis.

47:57.476 --> 47:58.612
Am I right, ladies?

47:59.646 --> 48:02.278
By the time you know
the size of a guy's penis,

48:02.280 --> 48:03.616
you've already committed.

48:04.516 --> 48:06.349
Any ladies ever looked
at a penis and said,

48:06.351 --> 48:07.721
"Sorry, I'm outta here?"

48:10.524 --> 48:11.990
I imagine that would be

48:11.992 --> 48:14.392
not because it's too small,
but because it's too big.

48:14.394 --> 48:16.394
Ooh!

48:16.396 --> 48:18.231
Ladies, you like 'em real big?

48:18.932 --> 48:20.497
Hey, I don't understand that.

48:20.499 --> 48:22.633
I thought the idea of sex
was that it was intimacy.

48:22.635 --> 48:24.368
Why do you want
to have sex with a guy

48:24.370 --> 48:25.673
who's in the other room?

48:29.575 --> 48:30.941
Is everything alright, sir?

48:30.943 --> 48:32.345
It's ok, I guess.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.882
You seemed to get very sober
with that telephone call.

48:36.884 --> 48:38.583
Pardon me?

48:38.585 --> 48:40.385
Somber, sober, sad.

48:40.387 --> 48:41.355
For a comedian,

48:42.223 --> 48:43.791
that doesn't sound good,
I don't think.

48:44.625 --> 48:46.694
I'm not sad. I'm just...

48:47.962 --> 48:49.864
I think I just am...

48:50.398 --> 48:51.896
got a lot going on in my mind

48:51.898 --> 48:54.699
'cause I'm performing
and there's a lot of pressure,

48:54.701 --> 48:57.706
'cause five minutes
for a comedian are an eternity.

48:57.972 --> 49:00.409
Hmm... I understand.

49:01.876 --> 49:04.813
But you are prepared
for these five minutes?

49:05.881 --> 49:07.383
Am I prepared?

49:08.416 --> 49:10.352
Is anybody ever prepared
in life?

49:10.952 --> 49:12.551
I don't know. We'll see.

49:12.553 --> 49:14.354
I mean, everything is timing.

49:14.356 --> 49:18.962
Sometimes when you're on stage
your timing is bang-on, and...

49:20.028 --> 49:22.462
you're in the rhythm
of the audience and the crowd,

49:22.464 --> 49:24.331
and sometimes
your timing is off,

49:24.333 --> 49:26.569
and you die a slow death.

49:27.569 --> 49:30.873
Hmm. Well, I have
faith in you, sir.

49:33.576 --> 49:35.713
What kind of faith
are you talking about?

49:38.982 --> 49:40.516
In my country...

49:41.851 --> 49:43.854
there's very little reason
for faith.

49:44.788 --> 49:45.991
In this country,

49:46.657 --> 49:48.492
you have every reason for faith.

49:49.327 --> 49:50.395
I have faith.

49:51.595 --> 49:52.731
You have faith?

49:53.430 --> 49:55.467
I have a gut feeling
about you, sir.

49:58.102 --> 50:00.772
But you don't even know
who I am, or what I am.

50:03.207 --> 50:05.606
You know there's two types
of people in the world, right?

50:05.608 --> 50:08.512
What do you mean,
two types of people?

50:09.046 --> 50:10.714
There's good souls,

50:10.716 --> 50:12.382
and there's assholes.

50:12.384 --> 50:14.887
How do you know I'm a good soul
and not an asshole?

50:16.020 --> 50:17.823
Faith, sir. Faith.

50:20.658 --> 50:22.625
The dog is cute.
Roxy, that's her name.

50:22.627 --> 50:25.027
We had a little compromise
with the dog.

50:25.029 --> 50:26.596
I wanted to get a male dog

50:26.598 --> 50:28.531
so we'd have
two neutered men in the family.

50:30.035 --> 50:32.935
What happened was I took
my daughter to see the puppies,

50:32.937 --> 50:34.972
and she fell in love
with a female,

50:34.974 --> 50:36.773
and she named her Roxy,

50:36.775 --> 50:41.512
because she has never been
to a strip club before.

50:42.749 --> 50:44.447
I know,
it's such a stripper name!

50:44.449 --> 50:46.751
If you're a guy, there's a list
of names in your head

50:46.753 --> 50:48.017
and they're not
in your head all cutesy,

50:48.019 --> 50:49.753
it's not like, "Roxy!"

50:49.755 --> 50:52.391
It's like, "Roxay!"

50:53.025 --> 50:54.457
"Coming to the dog park

50:54.459 --> 50:57.795
right now, gentlemen,
it's Roxay!"

50:59.031 --> 51:01.433
I know, I feel creepy
just calling this dog.

51:01.435 --> 51:05.038
I say,
"Roxy! Here girl..."

51:05.471 --> 51:06.737
"Who wants a big bone?

51:06.739 --> 51:09.576
Huh? Who wants it?"

51:10.611 --> 51:12.879
Why are you so happy?

51:14.013 --> 51:15.482
Look around you, sir.

51:16.450 --> 51:17.448
And?

51:17.450 --> 51:18.685
It is paradise.

51:23.992 --> 51:25.594
This is paradise to you?

51:25.960 --> 51:26.961
Very much so.

51:30.632 --> 51:31.800
Fine. You know what?

51:32.534 --> 51:34.802
I'll take that
into consideration...

51:35.836 --> 51:36.771
tonight.

51:37.639 --> 51:40.876
And hopefully give myself
a big break.

51:43.143 --> 51:44.445
Hopefully.

51:45.981 --> 51:46.883
Have faith, sir.

51:48.551 --> 51:49.886
You have faith in life?

51:51.854 --> 51:53.723
I'm grateful
every morning.

51:56.859 --> 51:57.861
For what?

51:58.526 --> 51:59.561
For who I am.

51:59.995 --> 52:03.866
For my...
happiness, for my children.

52:05.600 --> 52:06.669
For being alive.

52:07.002 --> 52:08.538
Ok. Nice.

52:13.143 --> 52:15.579
My father always planned
for the future.

52:16.947 --> 52:19.049
But the future
was short-lived for him.

52:20.683 --> 52:21.918
What are you gonna do?

52:26.056 --> 52:28.188
I did a whole bunch of TV shows
y'all might know,

52:28.190 --> 52:31.059
I was on <i>Growing Pains,</i>
I was on <i>The Drew Carey Show,</i>

52:31.061 --> 52:33.495
I played Peaches,
his hillbilly neighbor.

52:33.497 --> 52:34.796
I was on <i>The Golden Girls,</i>

52:34.798 --> 52:37.001
I was their
next door neighbor Ms. Mary.

52:37.267 --> 52:39.868
Um, I did <i>Beverly Hills 90210,</i>

52:39.870 --> 52:42.504
I did nine covers
of <i>Playboy</i> magazine

52:42.506 --> 52:43.839
around the world, whoo hoo!

52:46.243 --> 52:47.910
Thank you very much.

52:47.912 --> 52:50.011
I'd just like everyone to know
who I think I used to be.

52:51.883 --> 52:53.915
'Cause what I really am
is just a small town,

52:53.917 --> 52:55.783
blue jean wearing,
four-wheeler riding,

52:55.785 --> 52:58.054
hillbilly talking,
country music listening,

52:58.056 --> 52:59.889
tailgate sitting,
blowjob giving,

52:59.891 --> 53:01.791
blue collar boy loving
kind of gal.

53:08.132 --> 53:09.565
Most of the people here,

53:09.567 --> 53:11.000
when a <i>Playboy</i> Playmate's
speaking,

53:11.002 --> 53:15.639
it's "wah wah wah, wah wah wah,
blowjob giving,

53:15.641 --> 53:17.677
wah wah wah wah."

53:18.676 --> 53:21.814
I am sorry
that he is not here to...

53:22.782 --> 53:23.984
attend tonight.

53:25.285 --> 53:26.553
Me too.

53:27.119 --> 53:28.218
Me too.

53:28.220 --> 53:29.590
He was my biggest fan.

53:29.988 --> 53:33.593
And he stuck by me
when I was booed.

53:34.026 --> 53:34.961
But he is here.

53:39.298 --> 53:42.999
You have to forgive me, Jerry,
for being a little cynical.

53:43.001 --> 53:45.237
I really, truly,
don't want to offend

53:45.239 --> 53:48.674
what you believe in, in your...
culture and your religion,

53:48.676 --> 53:49.775
but I don't believe
in that shit.

53:49.777 --> 53:51.112
My father had faith,

53:52.011 --> 53:54.181
so did my mother,
and they're both gone.

53:55.716 --> 53:57.852
Did they have a good life?
Were they happy?

54:00.187 --> 54:01.152
Yeah, they were.

54:01.154 --> 54:02.987
Well, I never saw
my father on his deathbed,

54:02.989 --> 54:05.290
because I didn't have the guts.

54:05.292 --> 54:07.194
I didn't have the guts.

54:07.761 --> 54:10.099
But my mother, yes.
I was there when...

54:10.731 --> 54:15.070
she had her last breath of life
before they removed the...

54:15.903 --> 54:17.639
the batteries from her.

54:19.708 --> 54:20.976
Yeah, she was happy.

54:24.646 --> 54:26.180
You were there for your mother.

54:28.383 --> 54:30.920
That is a great blessing.

54:33.622 --> 54:34.557
I agree.

54:35.859 --> 54:39.062
I do, Jerry, I agree. I'm happy
I was able to say bye to her.

54:39.629 --> 54:42.933
And I'm disappointed in myself,
to be honest with you,

54:43.633 --> 54:45.832
that I didn't get a chance
to say bye to my dad,

54:45.834 --> 54:47.202
because I'm a fucking coward.

54:51.640 --> 54:53.140
And the whole theory about,

54:53.142 --> 54:55.712
you know, how black men
supposedly are all so well-hung?

54:56.011 --> 54:58.646
You think about the damage
that does to black men

54:58.648 --> 54:59.780
who are averagely hung?

55:01.784 --> 55:04.284
Just think about
how they have to walk around

55:04.286 --> 55:06.887
knowing that one day
they'll show their penis

55:06.889 --> 55:09.324
and it's not going to be
12 inches flaccid.

55:10.994 --> 55:13.061
And just think of how awful
they're going to feel

55:13.063 --> 55:14.999
in comparison
to the guys in porn.

55:15.298 --> 55:18.636
Because that's the only place
penises are actually that big.

55:19.302 --> 55:21.671
Oh, there's a lady here
who doubts that?

55:23.006 --> 55:24.809
The guy sitting next to her
is beaming.

55:25.109 --> 55:26.676
- Yeah.
- Where's your hand?

55:26.678 --> 55:27.877
Why's it under the table?

55:30.214 --> 55:33.915
Let us not be so sad,
you are a funny man.

55:33.917 --> 55:35.750
You're going to perform tonight.

55:35.752 --> 55:38.055
You are a very funny man.
I know it!

55:38.321 --> 55:40.455
What, are you
from Jerry Seinfeld?

55:40.457 --> 55:41.760
Who?

55:42.359 --> 55:43.729
It doesn't matter.

55:44.328 --> 55:46.797
I gave you two jokes
and you didn't laugh.

55:46.799 --> 55:48.034
I don't understand it.

55:50.168 --> 55:51.103
Try another one.

55:52.237 --> 55:53.206
Nah...

55:53.971 --> 55:55.137
But thank you, Jerry,

55:55.139 --> 55:56.842
I really appreciate it,
actually.

55:58.409 --> 56:02.144
I did not want to take an Uber,
because, I told my brother

56:02.146 --> 56:03.746
"They all smell like curry."

56:03.748 --> 56:05.949
- Hm?
- But your car smells brand-new.

56:05.951 --> 56:07.717
Because it is brand-new!

56:07.719 --> 56:10.354
Next week, if I pick you up,
it will smell like curry, but...

56:10.356 --> 56:13.026
That's funny.

56:13.959 --> 56:16.761
At least you're honest...
You're a good guy, Jerry!

56:16.763 --> 56:17.865
Thank you, sir.

56:18.865 --> 56:19.767
Are we close?

56:20.066 --> 56:22.035
Three and a half minutes, sir.

56:25.338 --> 56:26.839
Three and a half minutes.

56:28.441 --> 56:30.107
Because I was a Playmate,

56:30.109 --> 56:31.508
everybody just thinks
I knew everything about sex.

56:31.510 --> 56:33.113
Sex, sex, sex... Nuh-uh!

56:34.148 --> 56:35.847
I was about to get married,

56:35.849 --> 56:38.319
I didn't even know
how to give a... blowjob!

56:38.953 --> 56:40.351
And, um, then...

56:40.353 --> 56:43.154
I couldn't go have that sex talk
with my mama,

56:43.156 --> 56:45.324
'cause she works in a church
and it wasn't comfortable.

56:45.326 --> 56:48.427
So I went to Ms. Mary,
Hugh Hefner's secretary.

56:48.429 --> 56:50.896
Does anybody watch
<i>The Girls Next Door</i> show?

56:50.898 --> 56:52.230
- Did y'all know that show?
- Yes!

56:52.232 --> 56:54.166
Ok, you know who Ms. Mary is?

56:54.168 --> 56:58.437
Mis. Mary was in her 70s
when she gave me the sex talk.

56:58.439 --> 56:59.974
And this is what she said.

57:00.242 --> 57:02.542
She said: "Honey,
you did know that 'blow'

57:02.544 --> 57:04.544
was just an expression, right?

57:05.847 --> 57:07.249
It should be called 'suck it'."

57:10.919 --> 57:12.285
I was doing pretty good.

57:12.287 --> 57:14.153
I got these nice eyes,
decent-size feet,

57:14.155 --> 57:15.988
and these beautiful,
beautiful hands.

57:15.990 --> 57:17.524
Whoo!

57:17.526 --> 57:20.096
What they didn't tell me is that
if you're losing your hair,

57:20.461 --> 57:22.163
none of that other shit matters.

57:26.868 --> 57:28.738
I just recently
started shaving my head.

57:29.437 --> 57:32.475
I guess as an act of surrender
on behalf of my hair, really.

57:33.176 --> 57:35.042
It was obviously losing
the war to my forehead

57:35.044 --> 57:36.576
for dominance of my face.

57:39.047 --> 57:40.484
The hair put up a great fight.

57:40.949 --> 57:42.583
But the troops
just kept retreating,

57:42.585 --> 57:44.418
and retreating,
and retreating...

57:44.420 --> 57:45.790
Yeah.

57:46.990 --> 57:49.157
And then some of my forehead
flanked them from the back.

57:53.963 --> 57:55.930
Are there any other
famous comedians

57:55.932 --> 57:57.300
like yourself tonight?

57:58.202 --> 58:00.434
Um, you know what,
I'm really bad with names,

58:00.436 --> 58:02.838
but yes, it's very...

58:02.840 --> 58:06.006
People much more talented
than me, people very famous.

58:06.008 --> 58:08.343
I'm not famous at all,
nobody knows me.

58:08.345 --> 58:10.179
Oh,
then this sounds like

58:10.181 --> 58:12.050
an excellent opportunity
for you.

58:13.884 --> 58:15.953
Yeah, and I'm actually...

58:17.955 --> 58:20.288
quite surprised,
and trying to understand

58:20.290 --> 58:22.493
why I have this opportunity,
because....

58:23.093 --> 58:24.960
I think that I'm kind of...

58:24.962 --> 58:26.531
Being a little honest
with myself,

58:27.297 --> 58:29.265
I don't believe
I deserve this opportunity

58:29.267 --> 58:31.002
because I've been very lazy.

58:33.639 --> 58:36.809
Opportunity does not
come to those who deserve,

58:37.208 --> 58:40.112
just like bad things happen
to those who don't deserve.

58:40.545 --> 58:44.049
You should just accept it,
and not judge it.

58:45.316 --> 58:47.251
So you're saying
go with the flow?

58:47.253 --> 58:50.123
Well, be grateful
for the opportunity.

58:52.458 --> 58:54.994
And kill!

58:55.226 --> 58:56.193
"Kill?"

58:56.195 --> 58:57.498
Isn't that what they say?

58:58.163 --> 59:00.267
Yeah,
yeah they do, actually.

59:01.267 --> 59:04.003
I'll do my best, Jerry,
I'll do my best.

59:05.272 --> 59:07.138
By the way,
did you ever notice

59:07.140 --> 59:08.672
that there's a lot of jokes
you can't tell anymore?

59:08.674 --> 59:11.475
Things have become so sensitive,
there's jokes you can't tell.

59:11.477 --> 59:15.048
Which, ok, I understand it,
we're much more enlightened now.

59:15.415 --> 59:16.413
But what will we do

59:16.415 --> 59:18.649
with all those great Newfie
and Polish jokes?

59:20.319 --> 59:22.253
Who can be targets nowadays?

59:22.255 --> 59:24.222
So, c'mon,
the idea of a submarine

59:24.224 --> 59:26.260
with a screen door,
that's funny!

59:27.561 --> 59:30.695
The idea of a mission to the sun
that lands at night?

59:30.697 --> 59:31.996
That's funny!

59:33.300 --> 59:35.700
But now we can't attach it
to any ethnicity.

59:35.702 --> 59:37.635
What group
can we still make fun of?

59:37.637 --> 59:39.938
I'm thinking there's one group
we can still make fun of

59:39.940 --> 59:41.307
that everybody hates.

59:41.309 --> 59:42.307
Old people.

59:43.510 --> 59:46.645
Am I wrong?
Everybody hates old people.

59:48.316 --> 59:51.219
And let's face it,
old people is your age plus 40.

59:53.155 --> 59:54.990
Started losing
my hair when I was 19.

59:55.189 --> 59:58.126
- Ooh!
- Yeah, didn't seem fair at all.

59:58.526 --> 01:00:01.530
I went from one day I had to use
a fake ID to get into a bar,

01:00:02.229 --> 01:00:04.631
next day I'm getting
a senior's discount at Denny's.

01:00:14.009 --> 01:00:16.210
We're almost there, Mr. Simon.

01:00:16.212 --> 01:00:17.347
Are you rehearsing?

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:21.551
I never rehearse.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.223
Never?

01:00:27.556 --> 01:00:28.491
Never.

01:00:29.493 --> 01:00:33.196
Then you must
be perfect.

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:35.700
I'm far
from being perfect.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:38.236
Maybe it's because
I don't rehearse.

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:41.502
I have to rehearse
everything I do

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:44.075
because I want to be perfect.

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:46.977
Maybe that's
what I should do.

01:00:48.579 --> 01:00:50.544
Mr. Simon,
remember what you said:

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:54.649
there are two kinds of people,
good souls and assholes.

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.120
You are a good soul.

01:00:56.788 --> 01:00:58.090
You think?

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:00.359
- I know.
- You really think?

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:02.157
I have faith.

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:08.399
Thank you, Jerry.

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:12.136
That means a lot to me,
I appreciate it.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.139
Maybe that's what I need.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:17.575
I need a little faith.

01:01:22.814 --> 01:01:26.682
Actually, I've been doing
a lot of shows on cruise ships,

01:01:26.684 --> 01:01:29.322
but that market's
kind of dried up now.

01:01:30.155 --> 01:01:31.120
So...

01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:35.258
My favorite
cruise ship thing recently...

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:37.760
That Italian one
that went up on its side.

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:39.296
Aw!

01:01:39.298 --> 01:01:41.564
That captain, "Cap'n Crunch"

01:01:41.566 --> 01:01:44.501
as I like to call him,
you know what he did?

01:01:44.503 --> 01:01:48.306
Basically he was trying to wave
to a friend of his onshore,

01:01:48.308 --> 01:01:50.607
and basically he did, like,
the nautical equivalent

01:01:50.609 --> 01:01:54.411
of buzzing the tower
in a small plane, you know?

01:01:54.413 --> 01:01:57.382
And he was off the ship,
this guy, he was off the ship,

01:01:57.384 --> 01:02:00.054
before the passengers,
before the crew.

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:01.853
Right? And the excuses!

01:02:01.855 --> 01:02:03.587
"Oh, it was dark!

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:05.589
It was dark,
I fell in the lifeboat.

01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:09.528
It started paddling by itself,
I didn't know how to control it.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.197
I know how to work
the big ships,

01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:13.631
these little ones
are a mystery to me."

01:02:17.104 --> 01:02:20.338
"Oh, I was just testing out,
I was testing out the lifeboat

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.108
to make sure it was safe
for the other passengers."

01:02:24.512 --> 01:02:27.412
And I say, good thing
this happened in Italy.

01:02:27.414 --> 01:02:30.184
Right? Off the coast of Italy.

01:02:30.450 --> 01:02:32.485
Because anywhere else
in the world,

01:02:32.487 --> 01:02:34.386
"Me no speaking English!

01:02:34.388 --> 01:02:36.823
Boat go boom boom, she sink!
I don't know what happened!

01:02:36.825 --> 01:02:39.725
I'm just a guy standing here,
boat sink over there!

01:02:39.727 --> 01:02:42.328
Don't look at me,
I'm standing here all day

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.897
minding my own business,
boat sink over there.

01:02:44.899 --> 01:02:47.234
Somebody help those people! Ahh!

01:02:47.236 --> 01:02:49.236
Who put this uniform on me?

01:02:49.238 --> 01:02:50.603
This is not my uniform!

01:02:50.605 --> 01:02:53.676
I fell asleep,
a man put a hat on my head..."

01:02:57.447 --> 01:03:00.250
We're almost there, sir.
I'm very excited for you.

01:03:02.184 --> 01:03:03.487
I think I am too, now.

01:03:05.255 --> 01:03:06.523
Thank you, Jerry.

01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:09.493
Appreciate it.

01:03:12.427 --> 01:03:13.663
On the house, sir.

01:03:18.201 --> 01:03:21.106
Life is a series of moments.

01:03:21.437 --> 01:03:23.805
And hopefully
we will see each other again.

01:03:23.807 --> 01:03:25.276
We may not, but if we do,

01:03:25.542 --> 01:03:28.546
then that will be
a sign of friendship.

01:03:29.212 --> 01:03:31.415
And... another moment.

01:03:32.515 --> 01:03:34.482
You're very
philosophical, there, Jerry.

01:03:34.484 --> 01:03:36.287
But... you know what?

01:03:37.321 --> 01:03:39.424
If I see you again, it'd be...

01:03:40.557 --> 01:03:43.560
my honor and my pleasure
to call you my friend.

01:03:45.963 --> 01:03:48.299
You see? I am grateful.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:54.436
You know Jerry, ironically,
it is me who is grateful.

01:03:54.438 --> 01:03:57.342
And usually I'm always
the one that's ungrateful.

01:03:57.576 --> 01:03:59.545
And I just realized something...

01:04:00.811 --> 01:04:02.348
That I was very ungrateful

01:04:03.315 --> 01:04:05.315
for a lot of great things
in my life

01:04:05.317 --> 01:04:06.719
to a lot of great people.

01:04:07.953 --> 01:04:09.555
Thank you for that, Jerry.

01:04:10.856 --> 01:04:12.325
No charge, sir.

01:04:13.725 --> 01:04:14.760
No charge.

01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:31.741
We are friends, now.

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:32.643
You need some sugar.

01:04:32.645 --> 01:04:35.315
Give me a good luck hug!

01:05:09.684 --> 01:05:11.917
The fuck,
were you waiting there?

01:05:11.919 --> 01:05:13.885
What's the matter with you?
I thought you were dead!

01:05:13.887 --> 01:05:15.988
- What do you mean, "dead"?
- That you weren't coming.

01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:17.490
I told you I was.

01:05:17.492 --> 01:05:19.524
I know. Hang on, listen,
you're going last.

01:05:19.526 --> 01:05:21.661
I don't wanna go last,
that's a lot of pressure.

01:05:21.663 --> 01:05:22.962
I know, but it's the best spot.

01:05:22.964 --> 01:05:25.801
You'll be phenomenal.
You're going last.

01:05:26.701 --> 01:05:28.734
- That's Joseph Rogers.
- Yeah, don't...

01:05:28.736 --> 01:05:31.404
- Let me ask him a question.
- Look, Simon, Simon...

01:05:31.406 --> 01:05:33.609
Excuse me, Joseph?

01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:35.745
Mr. Rogers.

01:05:39.681 --> 01:05:42.551
Mr. Rogers, can I just ask you
a question? Please?

01:05:43.752 --> 01:05:45.555
What?

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:47.322
You've been writing a column

01:05:47.324 --> 01:05:48.691
for as long
as I've been doing this,

01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:51.829
how come you've never written
anything about me?

01:05:52.695 --> 01:05:54.898
'Cause I only write
about comedians.

01:06:03.572 --> 01:06:06.106
I got a few beauty tips
for the girls.

01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:08.710
Listen, instead of getting
Botox in your forehead

01:06:08.712 --> 01:06:10.678
like all the pinup gals do,

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.881
um, I recommend bangs.

01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:16.854
It's a whole lot cheaper
and a lot less painful.

01:06:20.691 --> 01:06:22.826
- You know me?
- I know who you are.

01:06:23.026 --> 01:06:24.859
Means a lot to me.
Thanks, appreciate it.

01:06:24.861 --> 01:06:27.129
Don't worry about it now.
You have a great show tonight.

01:06:27.131 --> 01:06:28.129
Thank you, Mr. Marino.

01:06:28.131 --> 01:06:29.834
- Kill 'em.
- Thanks.

01:06:35.139 --> 01:06:37.139
I'm not the sock,
I'm nobody's puppet,

01:06:37.141 --> 01:06:38.508
don't you be either.

01:06:41.146 --> 01:06:42.615
Thank you!

01:06:42.947 --> 01:06:45.949
Aww! My time is up!

01:06:45.951 --> 01:06:48.353
Give it up
for Julie McCollough, everybody!

01:06:48.619 --> 01:06:51.757
Thank y'all very much!
Thank you for having me!

01:06:53.057 --> 01:06:55.527
Thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen.

01:06:56.495 --> 01:06:58.497
Have yourselves a great evening.

01:06:59.631 --> 01:07:01.500
Give it up for him!

01:07:02.868 --> 01:07:05.571
- What a great crowd!
- I love you!

01:07:06.872 --> 01:07:10.443
Enjoy yourselves. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:07:10.642 --> 01:07:12.678
Thank you very much,
have a good night.

01:07:17.649 --> 01:07:18.984
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:07:19.484 --> 01:07:20.786
this man, once he retired

01:07:20.788 --> 01:07:22.454
from quarterbacking
the Miami Dolphins

01:07:22.456 --> 01:07:23.822
decided to become a comedian,

01:07:23.824 --> 01:07:27.057
please welcome the very,
very funny Mike Marino!

01:07:29.195 --> 01:07:31.431
Come on folks, make some noise!

01:07:33.199 --> 01:07:34.501
Come on, let's go!

01:07:39.505 --> 01:07:40.875
Thanks, appreciate it.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.706
Hey folks, one more time

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:44.074
for all these
great entertainers.

01:07:44.076 --> 01:07:45.611
Come on, ain't they fantastic?

01:07:49.082 --> 01:07:51.017
Thank you so much
for letting me come over.

01:07:51.019 --> 01:07:53.618
It's fantastic,
I'm very happy to be here.

01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:55.086
My name is Mike Marino,
I'm Italian,

01:07:55.088 --> 01:07:58.457
I'm from a small place in Italy
called New Jersey.

01:08:00.627 --> 01:08:02.028
Yeah, make sure you laugh
at what I say,

01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:04.966
I ain't even a comedian,
this is community service.

01:08:06.667 --> 01:08:07.899
I like being Italian.

01:08:07.901 --> 01:08:09.503
Growing up, a lot
of people never believed

01:08:09.505 --> 01:08:10.904
that I came
from an Italian family

01:08:10.906 --> 01:08:13.005
'cause I'm light skinned
and have blue eyes.

01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:15.074
Tell you people in this room
right now, full-blood Italian,

01:08:15.076 --> 01:08:17.912
both my parents born in Italy.
And I can prove that.

01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:22.715
I'm 55 years old,

01:08:22.716 --> 01:08:24.718
and I still live at home
with my ma.

01:08:31.658 --> 01:08:33.862
Don't worry about it,
I see it in your face.

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:36.734
You're gonna have a good set,
don't worry about it.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.232
- Alright?
- Thanks.

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:42.606
Get 'em! Break a leg!

01:08:46.609 --> 01:08:48.009
We think we need to involve
Italian people

01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:49.743
in more things in this world,
we wouldn't have

01:08:49.745 --> 01:08:51.545
half the problems
we've got, right?

01:08:51.546 --> 01:08:53.014
- Yeah!
- Think about it.

01:08:53.015 --> 01:08:55.517
I don't like what the president
is doing in the U.S.

01:08:55.519 --> 01:08:56.885
We need a nice,
Italian president

01:08:56.886 --> 01:08:58.621
from New Jersey to take over.

01:08:58.622 --> 01:09:00.826
- Yeah!
- I'd make a great president.

01:09:01.558 --> 01:09:02.890
I was running
for a year and a half,

01:09:02.893 --> 01:09:04.894
I shoulda been in there,
I woulda been perfect.

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:07.966
"Make America Italian Again,"
that's the slogan.

01:09:10.667 --> 01:09:11.937
That's right.

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:13.969
I had great ideas.

01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:15.738
I wouldn't have even needed
four years.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.072
Three months, straighten out
the whole country.

01:09:17.073 --> 01:09:18.640
Done, perfect.

01:09:18.642 --> 01:09:20.041
They'd ask me questions,

01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:22.645
like how did I end wars
in foreign countries.

01:09:22.647 --> 01:09:24.279
"Hey Mr. President,
you took care

01:09:24.282 --> 01:09:27.249
of that problem in North Korea,
can you tell us what you did?"

01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:28.917
I'd be on national television

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.319
dressed up
in a three-piece suit,

01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:33.023
but I have my Cabinet behind me,
you know my Cabinet?

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:35.928
Anthony, Nicky,
Joey, Sally, Tony...

01:09:36.928 --> 01:09:38.761
Like, "Mr. President,
what happened?"

01:09:38.763 --> 01:09:41.631
I'd be like, "Oh, you mean
out there in North Korea,

01:09:41.633 --> 01:09:43.001
with the guy and the thing?

01:09:44.804 --> 01:09:46.037
Well, here's what happened.

01:09:46.339 --> 01:09:49.676
We went out there to talk
to him, and then, uh...

01:09:50.577 --> 01:09:51.841
I don't know what happened."

01:09:53.679 --> 01:09:54.847
Yeah.

01:09:57.649 --> 01:09:58.785
"But he's gone now.

01:09:59.117 --> 01:10:01.218
And there's nothing
you can do about it."

01:10:03.089 --> 01:10:04.888
I always wanted
to be on television

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:06.222
during the debates.

01:10:06.224 --> 01:10:08.092
'Cause if you remember
during the debates,

01:10:08.094 --> 01:10:09.760
they made fun of each other
on national television,

01:10:09.762 --> 01:10:11.095
and you don't do that shit.

01:10:11.097 --> 01:10:12.763
That shows weakness
in foreign countries.

01:10:12.765 --> 01:10:14.735
Imagine them making fun
of a guy like me.

01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:17.235
Then the Master of Ceremonies
looks at me and says,

01:10:17.237 --> 01:10:19.204
"Mr. Marino, Clinton and Trump
just made fun of you

01:10:19.206 --> 01:10:22.644
on national television.
Would you like a rebuttal?"

01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:24.645
I'd say, "Yes I would!

01:10:25.311 --> 01:10:27.111
Go to a commercial break."

01:10:29.682 --> 01:10:30.949
Then we come back from break,

01:10:30.951 --> 01:10:32.818
you can't find
either of them anywhere.

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:34.252
Ooh!

01:10:34.254 --> 01:10:35.921
Then they look at me
and go, "What happened?"

01:10:35.923 --> 01:10:38.157
I'm like, "Ah...
I don't know what happened."

01:10:43.198 --> 01:10:44.831
"But they're gone now,

01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:46.902
and there's nothing
you can do about it."

01:10:49.738 --> 01:10:50.873
C'mon, people.

01:10:56.145 --> 01:10:58.147
It's ok.

01:10:58.947 --> 01:10:59.915
It's ok.

01:11:00.916 --> 01:11:02.352
<i>We know you want
to be a comedian.</i>

01:11:03.285 --> 01:11:05.155
<i>And you're talented.
You're funny.</i>

01:11:05.754 --> 01:11:09.088
<i>You are a funny man,
you're going to perform tonight.</i>

01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:11.760
<i>You are a very funny man.
I know it!</i>

01:11:14.163 --> 01:11:17.698
Folks, I actually just came back
from doing a USO comedy tour.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:20.200
I went to Afghanistan,
Baghdad, Kuwait.

01:11:20.202 --> 01:11:22.106
I went to go entertain
the troops.

01:11:22.438 --> 01:11:23.773
Right?

01:11:25.741 --> 01:11:26.975
Now, if you guys remember,

01:11:26.977 --> 01:11:28.877
when we first went
to war out there,

01:11:28.879 --> 01:11:30.211
France didn't want
to help America.

01:11:30.213 --> 01:11:31.215
Y'all remember that?

01:11:31.447 --> 01:11:33.181
France didn't want
to help America.

01:11:33.183 --> 01:11:35.850
So I told the troops
if I ran the country

01:11:35.852 --> 01:11:37.785
and France didn't want
to help America,

01:11:37.787 --> 01:11:40.055
I'd cut the head off
the Statue of Liberty

01:11:40.057 --> 01:11:42.193
and send it back to France
as a warning.

01:11:44.996 --> 01:11:47.096
People, don't make me
paint a picture for you.

01:11:47.098 --> 01:11:48.798
Imagine the French ambassador

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:50.331
seeing the head
of the Statue of Liberty

01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:52.170
come floating back in on a boat.

01:11:53.136 --> 01:11:54.937
Ok, but there's no body parts,

01:11:54.939 --> 01:11:57.740
just a head all fucked up
with an icepick in the eye.

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:00.809
That's sending a message.

01:12:00.811 --> 01:12:02.178
Oh!

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.013
C'mon you wanna talk
about discrimination?

01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:06.348
Whenever the Italians are
on television or movies,

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:07.819
what do they make us play?

01:12:08.087 --> 01:12:09.452
- Mob.
- Mafia, right?

01:12:09.454 --> 01:12:11.388
That's discrimination
against the Italians.

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:14.291
And all I ever wanted to play
was a mob boss in a mob movie

01:12:14.293 --> 01:12:16.826
and I've been in two of 'em,
and in both of them

01:12:16.828 --> 01:12:18.961
I was the Irish cop
that got whacked

01:12:18.963 --> 01:12:20.296
in the first 60 seconds.

01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:25.501
Get the Italians
are on some better shows.

01:12:25.503 --> 01:12:27.269
You know,
more educational type shows

01:12:27.271 --> 01:12:28.240
for the children.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.307
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:12:30.309 --> 01:12:32.009
You guys remember the movie
<i>The Sixth Sense?</i>

01:12:32.011 --> 01:12:33.443
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:12:33.445 --> 01:12:35.378
That would be a good place
for an Italian actor.

01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:38.185
Because then that little boy
would've been considered a rat.

01:12:40.853 --> 01:12:43.153
Think about it, he woulda went,
"I see dead people!"

01:12:43.155 --> 01:12:44.522
Guy woulda said,
"Shut the fuck up.

01:12:44.524 --> 01:12:45.890
You don't see nobody.

01:12:46.993 --> 01:12:48.262
We buried them good.

01:12:49.128 --> 01:12:51.128
Next dead person you gonna see
gonna be you.

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:52.497
Now go look for yourself."

01:12:52.499 --> 01:12:53.734
Ohh!

01:12:55.134 --> 01:12:58.870
And naturally you people
know most of the craziest trials

01:12:58.872 --> 01:13:00.972
come out of California.
Don't they, folks?

01:13:00.974 --> 01:13:03.141
You see the trials
that come out of California:

01:13:03.143 --> 01:13:06.278
O.J. Simpson, Laci Peterson,
Robert Blake...

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.012
Even the whole
Michael Jackson trial

01:13:08.014 --> 01:13:09.950
to me was like
a California event.

01:13:10.151 --> 01:13:11.917
'Cause I always tell
the people there

01:13:11.919 --> 01:13:13.519
if they ever killed anybody
from New York or New Jersey,

01:13:13.521 --> 01:13:16.124
that shit never
would've made it to a trial.

01:13:16.322 --> 01:13:18.090
Ooh!

01:13:18.092 --> 01:13:20.028
C'mon people, don't make me
paint a picture for you here.

01:13:20.862 --> 01:13:24.734
Imagine if O.J. Simpson killed
someone from an Italian family.

01:13:25.065 --> 01:13:27.267
That judge woulda asked
the family one time,

01:13:27.269 --> 01:13:30.473
"Does the family
wish to press charges?"

01:13:31.005 --> 01:13:33.007
Family woulda went, "Ha ha ha...

01:13:34.341 --> 01:13:35.310
No.

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.446
Let him go."

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.749
Yeah, "We forgive him.

01:13:40.549 --> 01:13:43.951
Better yet, judge,
we'll drive him home from here.

01:13:45.887 --> 01:13:49.258
Vinny! Get the bat,
O.J. is coming over."

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:51.925
That's my time, you guys
have been a great crowd.

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:53.160
I'm Mike Marino.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.765
Thank you very much, folks.

01:13:55.131 --> 01:13:56.897
- Thank you, buddy.
- Appreciate it.

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.301
Mike Marino, everybody!

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.342
Mike Marino!

01:14:07.909 --> 01:14:09.310
Mike Marino,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:11.846
That man is going places.
Is he funny or what?

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:12.984
Yeah!

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.220
Alright, now...

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:20.224
Now I have to tell you
that this last guest

01:14:21.158 --> 01:14:23.058
warms my heart,
that I have the opportunity

01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.126
to be on this stage
in my own place

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:26.497
and do this introduction.

01:14:27.097 --> 01:14:30.232
Ladies and gentlemen,
in his Basement debut,

01:14:30.234 --> 01:14:33.435
my personal friend Simon McCabe.

01:14:33.437 --> 01:14:34.569
Give it up for Simon!

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:42.914
Simon!

01:14:54.558 --> 01:14:56.927
Thank you very much,
it's very kind of you.

01:14:56.929 --> 01:14:59.495
So, ladies and gentlemen,
if you were to win the lottery,

01:14:59.497 --> 01:15:00.931
or you make a lot of money,

01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:02.531
what's the first thing
you're gonna do?

01:15:02.533 --> 01:15:04.002
You're gonna buy a car.

01:15:05.136 --> 01:15:06.973
A nice car
if you're a guy, right?

01:15:07.305 --> 01:15:09.373
So this penguin
wins a million dollars...

01:15:11.943 --> 01:15:14.912
...and he buys
a brand new 2018 Camaro.

01:15:14.914 --> 01:15:16.646
It's gorgeous, it's beautiful.

01:15:16.648 --> 01:15:18.080
He loves this car.

01:15:18.082 --> 01:15:19.382
So he's driving on a highway,

01:15:19.384 --> 01:15:21.619
and he hears a knock
on the engine.

01:15:21.621 --> 01:15:23.290
It's about 11:55 a.m.

01:15:23.622 --> 01:15:27.458
So he goes to a GM dealership,
which was right off the highway.

01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.262
And he goes, "Listen...

01:15:34.134 --> 01:15:35.666
...there's a knock
on the fucking engine.

01:15:35.668 --> 01:15:39.003
I love this car. I love it,
it's my first serious car."

01:15:39.005 --> 01:15:41.004
So the service advisor says,

01:15:41.006 --> 01:15:42.942
"Listen, it's 11:55,
it's a union shop,

01:15:43.243 --> 01:15:44.943
everybody goes to lunch
at twelve o'clock.

01:15:44.945 --> 01:15:46.946
There's a Dairy Queen across
the street, go over there.

01:15:46.948 --> 01:15:50.151
Get yourself an ice cream.
After lunch we'll look at it."

01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:51.887
Penguin goes, "Ok."

01:15:53.553 --> 01:15:55.554
Goes across,
one o'clock he shuffles back,

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:58.260
he's got this triple-decker
vanilla ice cream.

01:15:59.459 --> 01:16:00.494
Goes to the guy,

01:16:01.462 --> 01:16:03.261
"Did you get a chance
to look at my car?"

01:16:03.263 --> 01:16:05.030
Goes, "Yeah, it looks like
you blew a seal."

01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:07.435
He goes "Fuck you! All I'm doing
is licking the ice cream."

01:16:10.605 --> 01:16:12.208
Thank you. You're very kind.

01:16:19.047 --> 01:16:21.180
So a friend of mine...

01:16:21.182 --> 01:16:22.716
Any dog people?
You guys like dogs?

01:16:22.718 --> 01:16:24.186
- Yeah!
- Yes.

01:16:24.453 --> 01:16:26.185
You can tell a lot
about a human being

01:16:26.187 --> 01:16:27.420
if they're a dog guy.

01:16:27.422 --> 01:16:29.021
But some people
get carried away,

01:16:29.023 --> 01:16:30.390
everybody thinks
their dog's the smartest.

01:16:30.392 --> 01:16:31.757
They post them on Facebook...

01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:33.461
But this guy
took his dog everywhere.

01:16:33.463 --> 01:16:35.096
So he's in a bar
and his friend goes,

01:16:35.098 --> 01:16:36.529
"You know, it's a little weird

01:16:36.531 --> 01:16:38.099
that you go everywhere
with your dog."

01:16:38.101 --> 01:16:40.570
He goes,
"My dog is a fucking genius.

01:16:41.004 --> 01:16:42.569
My dog can do anything."

01:16:42.571 --> 01:16:44.672
The guy goes "Really?" Guy goes,
"Watch this. Rover, come here.

01:16:44.674 --> 01:16:46.207
Go get me a gin and tonic."

01:16:46.209 --> 01:16:48.211
"Alright."
Dog goes to the bar...

01:16:52.781 --> 01:16:54.347
He goes,
"What are you drinking?"

01:16:54.349 --> 01:16:56.450
"Very dry martini,
dirty, with one olive."

01:16:56.452 --> 01:16:59.588
"Rover, dry martini,
dirty with one olive."

01:16:59.590 --> 01:17:00.688
"Alright."

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:08.629
So guy says, "Big fuck. Your dog
knows how to make drinks."

01:17:08.631 --> 01:17:10.565
He goes, "My dog's a genius,
he can do anything."

01:17:10.567 --> 01:17:12.034
He goes,
"Let's put him to the test.

01:17:12.036 --> 01:17:13.270
I'll give him 20 dollars,

01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:16.574
tell him to get me
a small Marlborough.

01:17:17.306 --> 01:17:20.244
Regular. And bring me back
the exact change."

01:17:20.444 --> 01:17:22.014
"Rover, 20 bucks,

01:17:22.413 --> 01:17:24.546
small Marlborough, regular.

01:17:24.548 --> 01:17:25.781
Bring back the change."

01:17:25.783 --> 01:17:27.385
"Alright". Dog leaves.

01:17:28.653 --> 01:17:30.585
Fifteen minutes,
twenty minutes goes by,

01:17:30.587 --> 01:17:33.321
guy goes, "You know what?
Your dog's fucked,

01:17:33.323 --> 01:17:35.791
he's stupid, he's just a dog,
and I lost 20 bucks."

01:17:35.793 --> 01:17:37.692
He goes,
"No way. Something's wrong.

01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:39.295
My dog wouldn't do this."

01:17:39.297 --> 01:17:41.063
So they go looking for him
all over the place.

01:17:41.065 --> 01:17:42.464
Finally get to a park...

01:17:42.466 --> 01:17:44.367
"Rover, Rover!"
They looked and there's Rover

01:17:44.369 --> 01:17:46.569
banging the hell
out of this French poodle.

01:17:48.106 --> 01:17:49.473
So guy taps him
on the back goes,

01:17:49.475 --> 01:17:51.140
"Rover, you never did
this before."

01:17:51.142 --> 01:17:52.511
"I never had the money."

01:17:54.146 --> 01:17:55.315
Thank you.

01:18:00.485 --> 01:18:02.187
Simon McCabe!

01:19:55.438 --> 01:19:56.805
I just sold my first car

01:19:56.807 --> 01:19:58.707
and I totally grossed
the piss out of this guy.

01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:59.808
And cut. Keep rolling.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.809
Do it again.

01:20:00.811 --> 01:20:01.976
-You pissed the gross...

01:20:01.978 --> 01:20:03.912
- I pissed the gross
right out of him.

01:20:03.914 --> 01:20:05.814
- You got it?
- Can you do another one?

01:20:05.816 --> 01:20:07.082
No.

01:20:07.084 --> 01:20:09.452
I don't believe in that shit.
You've got to make a right here.

01:20:09.454 --> 01:20:11.654
Yeah, but this goes north.
I want to go south.

01:20:11.656 --> 01:20:13.388
Yeah, so we can't go south
this way,

01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:14.423
I fucked up.

01:20:14.425 --> 01:20:16.458
Why are we fucking talking?

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.695
What's going on here?

01:20:18.429 --> 01:20:20.696
What's going on here?
Didn't you say "action"?

01:20:20.698 --> 01:20:21.897
Yeah.

01:20:21.899 --> 01:20:23.399
Keep that fucking thing up
there, brother.

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:24.833
I love you. I don't wanna...

01:20:24.835 --> 01:20:26.535
it's not a Canadian movie
where we'll get knocked out

01:20:26.537 --> 01:20:28.303
with a fucking boom.

01:20:28.305 --> 01:20:30.306
I haven't been to bed yet, guys.

01:20:30.308 --> 01:20:31.642
How can I fucking work
without sleep, dude?

01:20:31.644 --> 01:20:33.310
Who can remember all this shit?

01:20:33.312 --> 01:20:34.848
Action! Action.

01:20:35.348 --> 01:20:36.480
Start again.

01:20:36.482 --> 01:20:37.748
Do it again, do it again.
Hang on.

01:20:37.750 --> 01:20:40.017
- I want it to be fluid, ok?
- Ok.

01:20:40.019 --> 01:20:41.317
Action.

01:20:41.319 --> 01:20:42.555
See this here?

01:20:42.854 --> 01:20:44.454
You know I love you, right?

01:20:44.456 --> 01:20:46.522
But every time you do this,
it gets lower and lower.

01:20:46.524 --> 01:20:48.258
You trying to kill me?

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.862
Your favorite wine, Simon?

01:20:50.263 --> 01:20:51.495
Please.

01:20:51.497 --> 01:20:52.896
Fuck it. Do it again.

01:20:52.898 --> 01:20:54.831
I'm not going to see it,
but she's going to see it.

01:20:56.336 --> 01:20:58.372
I need menus, and I need
two more of these.

01:20:59.472 --> 01:21:02.339
Get out of my shot, people.

01:21:02.341 --> 01:21:04.511
Hey Ed, I can hear you.

01:21:05.345 --> 01:21:06.777
Ed, I can hear you.

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:07.881
What's happening, bro?

01:21:08.382 --> 01:21:10.618
Sun tanning my balls.

01:21:13.353 --> 01:21:15.288
What a world they live in.
