00:35.702 --> 00:37.996
<i>Every day,</i>
<i>every one of us makes a trade.</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:42.417
<i>A pencil for a pen,</i>

00:44.502 --> 00:46.046
<i>an apple for an orange...</i>

00:47.839 --> 00:49.215
<i>a dance for a smile.</i>

00:51.634 --> 00:53.344
For Mr. Layton's eyes only.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.188
<i>But these trades</i>
<i>don't always go the way you plan.</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:06.649
<i>You give more than you get,</i>
<i>the terms change.</i>

01:07.942 --> 01:10.528
<i>You end up having to trade with yourself.</i>

01:16.242 --> 01:18.787
<i>I staked my future on a single trade.</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:23.958
<i>A life with him for a place on this train.</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:28.129
<i>It's been 19 revolutions.</i>

01:32.550 --> 01:34.969
<i>No matter how far I travelled,</i>

01:35.053 --> 01:38.348
<i>I should have known</i>
<i>Wilford would find me...</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:42.435
<i>on</i> Snowpiercer...

01:45.563 --> 01:48.483
<i>1,034 cars long.</i>

02:12.507 --> 02:14.926
I told Audrey
you wanted to see her.

02:15.009 --> 02:16.594
Good. And?

02:16.678 --> 02:20.515
Well, Wilford opens a lot of
old wounds, so just go easy on her.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.351
Hello, there, good morning.

02:23.434 --> 02:24.853
-Morning, Ruth.
-Zarah.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.438
Well, congratulations, Mr. Layton.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.816
Trade went off
without a hitch this morning.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.277
And this is for you personally.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.119
Well?

02:42.662 --> 02:46.332
Mr. Wilford's offering treatment
to our frostbite patients.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.085
Victims of his big ugly Coldman.

02:49.168 --> 02:50.753
Oh, from the Drs. Headwood?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.047
That's a generous offer. Wouldn't you say?

02:53.131 --> 02:54.048
Not exactly.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.014
I appreciate that. Thank you.

03:02.974 --> 03:06.060
Frostbite treatment?
Are you thinking it could help Josie?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.859
I think we have
14 frostbite patients it could help.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.277
-Bye.
Bye.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.270
I'm not asleep.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.901
<i>Snowpiercer</i> Engineers
launched their climate instruments today.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.362
Oh, yes,
the great uplink with Melanie.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.492
What if there's just silence,
but no contact at all?

04:05.370 --> 04:08.206
Then, she froze to death
exactly as you said.

04:08.289 --> 04:09.874
Quite a cliff-hanger, isn't it?

04:10.833 --> 04:13.211
-What's it say?
-"What do you want?"

04:13.294 --> 04:16.255
What does Mr. Layton
think I want?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.215
I know.

04:17.298 --> 04:19.676
Your paramour, Miss Audrey.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.177
"Paramour"?

04:21.719 --> 04:23.137
What novel are you reading?

04:23.221 --> 04:25.098
Why don't you
just invite her over already?

04:25.181 --> 04:26.849
Because what I want...

04:27.725 --> 04:29.894
is much more fun.

04:31.062 --> 04:35.066
How about a night out,
my dear, on <i>Snowpiercer?</i>

05:55.688 --> 05:57.398
Looks like you could use a cup of tea.

06:08.785 --> 06:13.539
Three brand-new bogie motors procured
in the middle of Alaska of all places.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.665
Yep.

06:14.749 --> 06:16.876
All right. I think I'm all calibrated.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.838
I've got temperature,
humidity, wind speed and barometer.

06:20.922 --> 06:21.756
Good.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.678
And... in you go.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.519
She's been out there for three days, Javi.

06:36.437 --> 06:37.397
I know, man.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.274
She's got the systems up.

06:40.900 --> 06:43.820
She's probably just waiting there
all warm and cozy for the data.

06:51.911 --> 06:52.745
So...

06:55.623 --> 06:57.959
He wants an evening out in his Nightcar.

06:59.460 --> 07:02.338
You've been putting off this conversation,

07:02.421 --> 07:04.966
so I can only guess
what it is you want me to do.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.342
You meant a lot to him.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.804
I spent years
washing my hands clean of him.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.474
I'd appreciate understanding it.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.481
When I was 18,
I was already a high-end escort.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.152
Private parties for the most
powerful men and women in Chicago.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.904
They would go on for days, these parties.

07:27.405 --> 07:29.073
And they were all on his trains.

07:30.658 --> 07:31.909
You need to know,

07:32.577 --> 07:33.578
I was his...

07:35.329 --> 07:37.999
exclusively, for years.

07:41.085 --> 07:44.297
It paid in gold, but I lost everything.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.967
And now,
you're asking me to reopen Pandora's box?

07:48.050 --> 07:51.387
If we had you in his ear
to gain his trust, to steer him,

07:52.263 --> 07:54.307
we will help you, all of us.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.144
This is the cause now, Audrey.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.401
I'll do it,

08:05.484 --> 08:07.153
but not for any of you.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.530
Not for the science, or Melanie's mission.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.365
This one's for me.

08:17.121 --> 08:17.955
<i>An invitation...</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:21.292
to the esteemed Joseph Wilford.

08:21.375 --> 08:24.712
"You are hereby invited
to a celebration of science

08:24.795 --> 08:27.798
with <i>Snowpiercer</i>
and their team of Engineers."

08:28.382 --> 08:30.593
A bit much, isn't it?
They're launching a balloon,

08:30.676 --> 08:33.638
not an inter-continental
ballistic missile.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.640
They're asking for a guest list.

08:35.723 --> 08:38.518
Which means
you would have to invite some of the crew.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.810
Oh, fiddlesticks, do I really?

08:39.894 --> 08:41.145
Yes, it's what we're here for.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.146
-Yeah.
<i>-Snowpiercer.</i>

08:42.230 --> 08:46.734
Not Dubs. He's actually been
dragging us around and around the world

08:46.817 --> 08:48.819
in desperate search of his paramour.

08:49.695 --> 08:50.530
Don't...

08:51.572 --> 08:52.782
say that word.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.038
She's a poem,

09:00.122 --> 09:01.165
you hear me?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.210
A witchy bird of grace

09:04.877 --> 09:07.004
that holds the soul of the train.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.839
She's a key.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.095
Do you want to seize <i>Snowpiercer</i>
in your fists with me or not?

09:15.012 --> 09:16.222
-Yes.
-We do.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.936
Good. Good.

09:23.104 --> 09:29.026
I was thinking of wearing
my silk brocade suit and my ruffle shirt.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.695
Thought that might be nice.

09:56.554 --> 09:59.557
Takes so little
for people to be so happy.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.474
Don't ruin it.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.102
This is the most delicious thing
I've tasted in seven years.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.270
It gets better.

10:05.313 --> 10:08.399
My good people.
You have been so patient.

10:08.482 --> 10:11.193
No, no, no, please... please be seated.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.947
I promised you fresh fruit and vegetables.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.033
You've earned them.

10:21.537 --> 10:23.456
But I promised you
something else, didn't I?

10:24.415 --> 10:27.501
One thousand and one cars
to stretch your legs.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.796
And tonight,
I'm gonna fulfill that pledge.

10:30.880 --> 10:31.714
Yes.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.134
All of your names are inside this hat.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.887
Mr. Wilford will select three crew members

10:37.970 --> 10:40.514
for a night out on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

10:41.599 --> 10:42.933
Our first lucky winner is...

10:47.605 --> 10:48.731
Oiler Bob.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.067
-Come on, Bobby!

10:52.610 --> 10:55.321
Our second intrepid adventurer is...

10:55.404 --> 10:57.323
Don't freak out,
you'll be one of the names.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.492
Oh, my God, I love you.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.660
Damien Ho!

11:02.078 --> 11:03.120
Good job, Damien!

11:03.663 --> 11:05.414
I like the cut of your jib, son.

11:06.332 --> 11:11.712
And the third
and final name on my guest list is...

11:13.798 --> 11:14.965
our seamstress Emilia.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.133
My goodness!

11:17.218 --> 11:18.469
-My goodness, it's me!
Come on!

11:18.552 --> 11:22.098
She deserves it. Well done!

11:29.188 --> 11:31.482
Wilford's guest list
is three names I don't recognize.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.984
Is there anybody on that list
we can turn to our advantage?

11:34.068 --> 11:35.653
Right,
I'll take them to the notary.

11:35.736 --> 11:38.447
If they were ticketed
on <i>Snowpiercer,</i> we'll have records.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.490
Good. Ben?

11:40.282 --> 11:42.159
Tonight, we make
first contact with Melanie.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.870
Let's not forget
that's what this evening's all about.

11:44.954 --> 11:48.290
Yes. It's a hopeful message
to share with our guests.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.961
By celebrating the mission's first step,
we make this endeavor undeniable to them.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.131
And Wilford's cooperation
has to be inescapable.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.426
What happens if we bring Wilford up here,
and we don't hear from Melanie?

11:58.509 --> 11:59.802
She has to make contact.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.555
Agreed. This is our leap of faith.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.266
We wanna make inroads with his crew,

12:05.349 --> 12:08.978
show them what freedom looks like,
so that Wilford can't demonize us.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.148
He'll be doing the same thing
to us, seducing our crew.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.316
He'll try and turn everyone in this room.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.027
He's already got his hooks in some of us.

12:18.028 --> 12:19.947
If you're referring to me,
come out and say it.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.658
No, I mean anyone who knew him before.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.326
Anyone he hired personally.

12:24.410 --> 12:27.037
Yeah. Well, I worked security detail
for the man for four years.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.706
Anyone else work for Mr. Wilford?

12:29.248 --> 12:31.083
This circle
has got to trust each other.

12:31.876 --> 12:35.838
Now, I need you to give Mr. Wilford
the greatest night he has ever had

12:35.921 --> 12:37.131
aboard <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

12:38.299 --> 12:40.468
-Hospitality would like nothing more.
Good.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.470
Then let's put on a show.

12:46.056 --> 12:46.891
I just...

12:48.851 --> 12:50.519
I saw those faces.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.982
It just hit me, how few of us are left.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.819
How many we've lost.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.823
But here I still am,

13:04.909 --> 13:06.035
barely a scratch.

13:07.369 --> 13:09.914
Hey, we all ask why, Bess.

13:11.874 --> 13:13.501
What do you still stand for?

13:14.543 --> 13:15.586
Uh...

13:19.381 --> 13:21.133
I used to know what was true,

13:22.259 --> 13:23.427
what wasn't...

13:25.596 --> 13:26.805
where I belonged.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.059
But...

13:31.727 --> 13:33.103
now I have no one.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.398
Just this...

13:38.025 --> 13:40.986
Hey. Hey.
There's 3,000 of us...

13:42.071 --> 13:42.947
left.

13:43.030 --> 13:46.075
Two thousand,
seven hundred and forty-seven...

13:47.201 --> 13:48.410
on <i>Snowpiercer.</i>

13:49.245 --> 13:52.623
Actually, it's 46.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.126
A mess chef died yesterday.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.087
Yeah.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.134
Billions of souls have left us, Bess.

14:06.595 --> 14:12.268
It's because we're so few that
the survivor's guilt feels unbearable.

14:16.313 --> 14:17.231
You're not alone.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.740
Hmm.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.160
All right. Would you like to follow me?

14:35.666 --> 14:37.668
All right. Okay.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.470
-It's amazing.
You see?

14:48.554 --> 14:50.931
The patient feels almost instant relief.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.266
What does it do exactly?

14:52.349 --> 14:56.520
It's a hydrogel-based bio...

14:56.604 --> 14:57.438
All done here.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.691
We have one more patient,
up in the Second Class clinic.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.359
-Right this way.
Uh-huh.

15:03.777 --> 15:04.612
I got this one.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.865
Um, I know who you're taking them to see.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.617
Hospitality needs to escort them.

15:19.752 --> 15:23.714
-Oh. It's very serious.
Very serious indeed.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.841
She'd need custom grafting.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.635
Clot busters for blood flow.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.845
Well,
she'll have to come back to our lab.

15:31.347 --> 15:32.723
Your lab on <i>Big Alice?</i>

15:33.307 --> 15:36.602
Sterile recovery.
Absolutely no visitors.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.313
Can we have a moment?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.028
Melanie doesn't understand.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.906
What are we talking about?

15:55.412 --> 15:56.246
Your Andre Layton.

15:57.289 --> 16:01.168
Melanie tells me that I should trust him,
but it's him that doesn't trust me.

16:02.419 --> 16:04.463
He has no idea how hard I work.

16:04.546 --> 16:05.422
I do.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.634
You know every passenger
by name, every Class, every Guild.

16:08.717 --> 16:09.843
Every nook and every cranny.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.681
And just because
I admire Mr. Wilford, that doesn't mean...

16:14.682 --> 16:16.225
that I'm disloyal.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.477
I am loyal... to the train.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.816
He's pushing me out.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.152
He's pushing out my department.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.696
Maybe we could help each other.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.200
What do you think
about me joining Hospitality?

16:35.953 --> 16:36.787
Go on.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.332
Do you think I should be worried?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.793
Does Wilford know who I am?

16:42.876 --> 16:46.714
I think frostbite therapy
is too good of a coincidence.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.341
Well, how could they know
that much about us already?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.094
Our names
weren't on the original manifest.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.138
Ruth?

16:55.514 --> 16:56.598
No, not Ruth.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.183
Not yet.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.893
Does the therapy work?

16:59.977 --> 17:03.313
It seems to, but the Headwoods
are doing other shit back there.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.733
Augmenting people for cold resistance.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.402
You'd be too isolated.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.571
Look at me, Layton.

17:11.697 --> 17:13.615
Properly, you haven't been.

17:14.658 --> 17:16.160
I'm not going to recover here.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.621
-Josie...
-At least I could be of use back there.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.790
You need eyes on them, don't you?

17:22.291 --> 17:24.126
I'll find out everything I can.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.048
And I know you've got Pike
cooking something at the border.

17:29.590 --> 17:33.552
Yeah, if tonight goes as planned,
we should have a pipeline.

17:34.053 --> 17:34.887
Well, then...

17:36.472 --> 17:37.598
let's use it.

17:48.025 --> 17:48.859
What is this?

17:50.778 --> 17:51.653
That's what you get.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.781
You said you're gonna
bring all your product to <i>me.</i>

17:53.864 --> 17:55.657
I didn't say that, you said that.

17:56.241 --> 18:00.079
After you said you don't like
being seen doing business with the Tail!

18:00.162 --> 18:03.207
All right, keep it down. Relax.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.128
There's a rumor.
Wilford's coming uptrain again.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.880
Big event in the Nightcar.

18:10.506 --> 18:15.135
So, I'll take the weed,
and a good price. Hmm?

18:16.011 --> 18:16.845
What you got?

18:17.513 --> 18:18.347
All right.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.142
Ooh.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.395
-There.
-More <i>Britannicas.</i> Nice!

18:25.979 --> 18:27.648
You know, Terence,

18:27.731 --> 18:31.360
Janitorial has become
a geopolitical casualty.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.779
The Tail is the new pipeline for riches.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.742
Maybe get your mop jockeys
to move that quickly for me,

18:38.826 --> 18:41.120
and I'll give you
a little more weight next time.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.299
Tell your people to stop.

18:55.634 --> 18:56.844
I did not do that.

18:56.927 --> 18:59.388
If you use the Tail
in your Wilford games, we'll come for you.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.390
That's our four hundred to your ten.

19:02.015 --> 19:04.560
And you will meet
more than just Breachmen.

19:04.643 --> 19:09.273
There are many, many more of us
right under your little nose.

19:12.317 --> 19:13.402
Incoming!
-Hey!

19:25.873 --> 19:27.166
What's the Nightcar like, Alex?

19:27.749 --> 19:29.042
I heard it's a brothel.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.003
I think it's more like a cabaret.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.629
They're gonna have everything.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.797
Mangoes?

19:34.381 --> 19:36.341
-Excited, are we?

19:37.551 --> 19:38.677
Yes, sir.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.304
Well, get this straight.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.223
This is my night.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.436
A chance for me
to meet up with old acquaintances,

19:47.519 --> 19:50.898
and hopefully,
see Melanie's balloon pop in their faces.

19:51.481 --> 19:52.357
All right?

19:53.609 --> 19:54.484
Easy-peasy.

19:55.235 --> 19:57.196
Everybody got their top buttons done up?

19:58.864 --> 20:01.700
Time for your big night out! Come on!

20:10.834 --> 20:12.544
The Tailies jumped Boki.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.379
Payback for Lights, I guess.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.215
He claims they tried to kill him.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.426
If four Tailies wanted
to kill a Breachman, he would be dead.

20:19.509 --> 20:20.636
Look at this shit.

20:20.719 --> 20:23.222
We got Tailies wandering
around uptrain with these.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.057
Yo, Layton,
we gotta protect ourselves.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.019
No one needs to open carry
in the market right now.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.813
Going crazy over here.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.900
Hey, I told you I'd take care of it.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.279
Boki, you ever meet Wilford?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.405
<i>Da.</i>

20:41.114 --> 20:45.118
First, when I was 14,
building bridges for him in Serbia.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.246
Guess that makes you
a lifer, then?

20:48.789 --> 20:50.499
Proud to say, it does.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.543
Hey! Hey!

20:54.086 --> 20:56.797
-Come on! What is wrong with you?
-My foot slipped, all right?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.883
Hey, you don't know that guy's
the finger-chopper. The hell was that?

20:59.967 --> 21:01.802
Look, I have a Wilford problem.

21:01.885 --> 21:03.595
Whether the Breachmen did it or not,

21:03.679 --> 21:06.390
he's got support up here,
and he's coming uptrain tonight.

21:09.059 --> 21:13.188
How much do you want Boki hanging around,
waving three fingers, riling everybody up?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.690
We can hold him under martial law.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.358
Indefinitely, if you want.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.112
Okay. So, throw Boki in the brig,
confine the rest to quarters.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.156
But I'm telling you,
there's something deeper going on here.

21:25.701 --> 21:29.121
I know. I know times are changing.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.209
But whatever happens to me,
the Tail needs to stand by Layton.

21:35.669 --> 21:36.503
Josie...

21:37.546 --> 21:38.922
We have something for you.

21:45.846 --> 21:46.722
Miles...

21:49.266 --> 21:50.183
Miles.

21:52.894 --> 21:56.023
I didn't want you to come.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.984
I don't care, Mom. You're my hero.

22:01.486 --> 22:02.904
Guess where he's engineering?

22:03.697 --> 22:04.698
Life Systems.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.618
I wanna be one of
the first colonists to be back outside.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.873
You hold on to that hope, Miles.

22:18.795 --> 22:19.629
All right.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.467
Ready.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.115
It's okay.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.747
Are you nervous?

23:37.124 --> 23:39.251
I'm just worried about Audrey.

23:40.710 --> 23:41.670
I'll have her back.

23:43.380 --> 23:44.548
And yours.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.509
Hey...

23:48.343 --> 23:49.302
Oh, no.

23:49.386 --> 23:50.846
No, no, no.

23:50.929 --> 23:52.222
Oh, yes.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.473
I'm joining Hospitality.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.017
Ruth is just using you
to influence me.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.562
-It's my idea, not hers.

23:58.645 --> 24:00.856
This way I can keep an eye on her.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.275
I think you should stay out of it.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.276
You need her.

24:04.359 --> 24:05.902
Yeah, so I've been told. Thank you.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.946
Then listen, and let me help.

24:09.823 --> 24:10.782
Typical.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.826
We're minutes away
from being able to leave,

24:12.909 --> 24:14.411
and you go and change everything.

24:14.494 --> 24:16.121
What? All I changed was the outfit.

24:16.204 --> 24:19.416
Yeah. Teal. It's not your color.

24:20.083 --> 24:22.794
Since we're not together anymore,
I'm not sure you really get to say that.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.589
Oh, yeah?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.007
-What are you--
-Do the other one.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.466
Just trust me.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.510
Let's see.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.847
Much better. Man of the people.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.726
I forgot you're really good at this.

24:39.352 --> 24:40.187
You're welcome.

24:40.854 --> 24:41.771
Thank you.

24:41.855 --> 24:42.772
Ready?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.986
Ladies and gentlemen, without further ado,

24:48.069 --> 24:50.780
I present, Mr. Wilford and his crew.

24:55.660 --> 24:58.580
Wilford!
Wilford! Wilford!

24:58.663 --> 25:01.708
Good to see you.
Good to see you all.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.339
Thank you very much. Thank you.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.340
All your area.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.009
Thank you very much.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.100
There he is.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.982
-Mr. Layton.
Mr. Wilford.

25:26.066 --> 25:31.905
We welcome you and your crew to this
historic moment of hope for our people.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.700
If I can direct all of your attention
towards our Engineers.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.787
-All right.

25:39.579 --> 25:40.872
-Good?
We're good.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.500
Good evening, everyone.

25:43.583 --> 25:46.294
<i>Tonight, we'll be launching</i>
<i>the first weather balloon</i>

25:46.378 --> 25:49.839
<i>that will transmit data</i>
<i>to our own Melanie Cavill.</i>

25:49.923 --> 25:50.757
Ben.

25:50.840 --> 25:55.136
<i>Once the balloon reaches height,</i>
<i>which is in about 75 minutes,</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:58.473
<i>Melanie will link to it,</i>
<i>and we'll hear a signal.</i>

25:58.557 --> 26:01.518
That ping will indicate
that Melanie is safe,

26:02.102 --> 26:04.980
and that our mission is underway.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.523
I say there won't be a ping.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.066
Anyone taking wagers?

26:08.149 --> 26:09.859
<i>It looks like</i>
<i>we're in launch mode now,</i>

26:09.943 --> 26:11.319
<i>and Javi will do the honors.</i>

26:11.403 --> 26:17.951
<i>Okay. We're launching in three, two, one.</i>

26:35.593 --> 26:37.178
<i>We'll be back in a short while</i>

26:37.262 --> 26:39.431
<i>to update you with our progress.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:45.687 --> 26:47.022
Better finish dressing.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.357
Wilford awaits.

26:49.983 --> 26:51.401
I always made him wait.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.906
You sure you wanna do this?
There's still time to back out.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.866
I'm sure.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.243
Will you take this out to him?

27:02.078 --> 27:02.912
Zarah,

27:03.621 --> 27:05.373
when I get him in there,

27:05.915 --> 27:08.710
if I'm not out in 30 minutes, come get me.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.260
Thank you.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.392
I see you've raided my cellar.

27:25.727 --> 27:30.815
'99 Vogüé Musigny Vieilles Vignes.

27:33.193 --> 27:37.864
My friends, we are now crossing
the Great Bering Strait Bridge

27:38.406 --> 27:40.325
between Alaska and Siberia.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.745
Until Mr. Wilford built this bridge,

27:44.537 --> 27:47.916
those two shores had
not been connected since the last ice age.

27:50.960 --> 27:54.714
So, as we roll atop the frozen ocean,

27:54.798 --> 27:56.299
let us all raise a glass.

27:56.800 --> 27:57.634
To Mr. Wilford.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.469
Cheers!
To Mr. Wilford.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.305
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.641
Thank you. Cheers.

28:06.184 --> 28:10.271
Mr. Layton, your journey
has been a fascinating one,

28:10.355 --> 28:13.441
from stowaway to rebel leader, to...

28:14.818 --> 28:16.361
the running of my train.

28:16.444 --> 28:18.530
Yeah. All due respect,

28:20.156 --> 28:21.324
it's not your train.

what the years have done to you.

31:10.451 --> 31:11.578
You're different.

31:14.163 --> 31:15.456
The Freeze changed us all.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.375
The Nightcar, too.

31:19.669 --> 31:20.503
How?

31:23.131 --> 31:24.716
I made her into something new.

31:27.051 --> 31:28.761
It's still a playground,

31:29.262 --> 31:31.639
but not so much for individual pleasure.

31:33.641 --> 31:35.143
No pleasure at all?

31:39.981 --> 31:41.107
Let me show you.

31:43.067 --> 31:47.447
Every single person
on this train is traumatized.

31:48.740 --> 31:51.492
I try and help them find peace.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.498
We can be frank
with each other about what we lost.

31:57.582 --> 31:58.917
I never lose anything.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.793
No regrets at all, Joseph?

32:02.795 --> 32:04.464
Everyone's grieving, save you?

32:08.009 --> 32:10.345
I grieved losing you for seven years.

32:20.188 --> 32:23.316
This experience
requires you to open your heart.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.151
Let me in.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.780
Can you do that?

32:38.122 --> 32:40.083
What is going on exactly?

32:40.166 --> 32:41.709
Sticky little honeypot?

32:41.793 --> 32:43.127
That's up to them, Ruth.

32:43.211 --> 32:46.756
They got 40 minutes till
the next act with the weather balloon.

32:46.839 --> 32:47.799
Keep those ones happy.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.134
G'day, love. More wine?

32:50.718 --> 32:52.553
Holy shit. Are you Aussie?

32:52.637 --> 32:55.348
Yeah, fair dinkum. I'm the last Aussie.

32:55.431 --> 32:57.016
Nah, mate, I'm the last Aussie.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.352
What? Really?

32:59.435 --> 33:02.563
-Shit! Strewth, Z, she's from Oz.
-No way!

33:02.647 --> 33:04.148
Hi!
Hi.

33:04.232 --> 33:07.193
Hi. I'm Murray.
Emilia.

33:07.276 --> 33:10.279
Emilia. You're not from Sydney, are you?

33:10.363 --> 33:11.823
-No, I'm from Perth.
You're from Perth?

33:11.906 --> 33:13.449
She's a Western girl!

33:14.450 --> 33:16.035
Anything else I can get you?

33:16.119 --> 33:18.246
Hmm. So many things,

33:18.329 --> 33:20.623
but I'll settle for another.

33:25.628 --> 33:26.462
Boo!

33:27.255 --> 33:29.590
I remember you. Lilah Junior.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.633
It's LJ.

33:30.717 --> 33:32.969
I remember you, too.
You're Melanie's daughter.

33:33.052 --> 33:34.429
You were such a dork.

33:34.512 --> 33:36.639
You were such a bitch.

33:37.807 --> 33:38.725
Accurate.

33:39.976 --> 33:40.935
Come on.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.130
I was supposed to be in the Laundry
on <i>Snowpiercer,</i> but it left without us.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.716
Is that what you do on <i>Big Alice?</i>

34:13.885 --> 34:15.094
I'm not supposed to say.

34:17.138 --> 34:18.931
You guys all right over there?

34:20.433 --> 34:21.476
Yeah, we're all good.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.562
Look, I might have a way to keep in touch.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.230
Here.

34:27.148 --> 34:28.065
What are they?

34:29.150 --> 34:30.359
They're my lucky goggles.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.527
You take them.

34:32.195 --> 34:34.489
You wear 'em on your train,
and someone will contact you.

34:42.789 --> 34:43.623
Come on!

34:46.751 --> 34:50.630
Best part about being a janitor
is you get to go everywhere.

35:08.606 --> 35:09.482
Wow!

35:13.361 --> 35:14.320
I brought presents.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.077
An <i>Encyclopedia Britannica?</i>

35:21.160 --> 35:23.746
"W." Which has woolly mammoth.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.456
Totally badass.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.375
Totally extinct.

35:28.626 --> 35:29.627
And...

35:40.304 --> 35:41.430
Tell me what you see.

35:44.642 --> 35:45.893
<i>There's dancing.</i>

35:52.525 --> 35:54.110
<i>I can hear a band playing.</i>

35:56.237 --> 35:58.239
Your voice in my ear.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.327
Tell me what else you're experiencing.

36:07.456 --> 36:12.420
<i>♪ I am lost in a rainbow ♪</i>

36:13.421 --> 36:18.134
<i>♪ Now our rainbow is gone ♪</i>

36:19.218 --> 36:23.931
<i>♪ Overcast by your shadow ♪</i>

36:25.224 --> 36:29.395
<i>♪ As our worlds move on ♪</i>

36:31.147 --> 36:37.153
<i>♪ In this shirt, I can be you ♪</i>

36:37.236 --> 36:41.532
<i>♪ To be near you, for a while ♪</i>

36:43.367 --> 36:47.914
<i>♪ In this shirt, I can be you ♪</i>

36:49.207 --> 36:54.212
<i>♪ To be near you, for a while ♪</i>

36:55.171 --> 36:59.884
<i>♪ There's a crane knocking down ♪</i>

37:01.010 --> 37:05.681
<i>♪ All these things that we were ♪</i>

37:07.058 --> 37:12.188
<i>♪ I awake in the night... ♪</i>

37:14.232 --> 37:15.066
No.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.575
You made me cut my own wrists.

37:28.663 --> 37:29.747
But I saved you.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.846
I want it, Audrey.

37:45.930 --> 37:46.889
No.

37:48.516 --> 37:49.350
Please.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.352
I need it.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.105
I need you.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.941
You're the only one.

37:58.276 --> 37:59.986
You're the only one, Audrey.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.070
I need it.

38:23.592 --> 38:24.719
Oh, my God.

38:24.802 --> 38:25.970
I want it.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.905
That's a five-minute warning
from the Engine.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.170
Five-minute warning.

39:20.816 --> 39:22.276
My parents froze to death,

39:22.818 --> 39:27.156
with, like, 170 other people in the war.

39:27.239 --> 39:29.366
So my mom's probably somewhere, like...

39:35.581 --> 39:36.582
Do you miss her?

39:39.335 --> 39:41.921
Literally everybody
in the world froze to death, so...

39:42.922 --> 39:45.841
Well, I just got around to
even knowing my mom again,

39:45.925 --> 39:47.843
and now she's off on a volt sled, so...

39:48.594 --> 39:51.597
Guess she's
somewhere freezing, doing this...

39:57.853 --> 40:00.940
But Wilford, he raised you, though, right?

40:03.818 --> 40:04.777
Yeah.

40:06.445 --> 40:08.072
He would hate to hear me saying this,

40:08.155 --> 40:11.534
but I just didn't know
I was gonna care about Melanie this much.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.413
Hmm.

40:19.542 --> 40:20.376
Hey.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.795
Way up there, that flashing light,

40:23.379 --> 40:24.380
isn't that her balloon?

40:24.463 --> 40:25.297
Yeah, it is.

40:32.221 --> 40:33.681
Maybe she can see it, too.

40:36.350 --> 40:39.520
We must be at the altitude
for her uplink, I should probably go.

40:42.481 --> 40:43.691
Let's not be friends.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.735
Total enemies.

40:49.113 --> 40:49.947
Right now.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.533
-I don't even--
-Excuse me. Thank you.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.492
Where is Mr. Wilford?

40:53.576 --> 40:55.327
It's about to start.
He's going to miss it.

40:55.411 --> 40:58.414
Is Audrey okay?
-She's fine. They're coming, I think.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.417
Are you excited, Alexandra?

41:03.043 --> 41:04.044
It's a big moment.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.338
Wilford thinks she's dead already.

41:06.964 --> 41:07.882
What do you think?

41:09.550 --> 41:13.387
I think that if there's one person that
could survive out there, maybe it's her.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.264
That's right.

41:15.347 --> 41:16.223
Oh, goody!

41:16.307 --> 41:19.059
There you are, sir.
I've got a seat for you, right up front.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.812
Finally, the main event.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.106
The countdown we've all been waiting for.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.275
Welcome back, sir.
-Thanks, Layton.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.028
<i>Hello again,</i>
<i>from the cockpit of</i> Snowpiercer.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.531
<i>Please, take</i>
<i>your own front seat to history.</i>

41:33.908 --> 41:37.828
Our weather balloon
is at thirty-four thousand...

41:37.912 --> 41:39.246
Seven hundred meters.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.248
Once it hits 35,000,

41:42.124 --> 41:44.960
Melanie should link to it and start
collecting all of its weather data.

41:45.044 --> 41:49.131
The first step in her finding
where we can start recolonization.

41:51.133 --> 41:52.009
<i>Here we go.</i>

41:54.220 --> 41:56.472
<i>We are at 34,800.</i>

41:59.642 --> 42:00.476
<i>Eight-fifty.</i>

42:06.732 --> 42:07.691
Sorry.

42:09.610 --> 42:10.903
Thirty-five thousand meters.

42:18.827 --> 42:20.829
Thirty-five thousand, one hundred...

42:30.172 --> 42:31.090
<i>One-fifty...</i>

42:39.223 --> 42:40.099
Two hundred...

42:45.229 --> 42:46.522
<i>Two hundred and fifty...</i>

42:59.159 --> 43:00.619
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

43:02.746 --> 43:03.580
<i>Yes!</i>

43:03.664 --> 43:05.124
<i>Yes, Melanie! Yes!</i>

44:07.728 --> 44:08.562
Salud!

44:28.123 --> 44:29.124
What was that...

44:30.000 --> 44:31.085
between you and Wilford?

44:31.752 --> 44:33.212
I told you what could happen.

44:34.421 --> 44:35.506
Should I be worried?

44:38.342 --> 44:39.176
Trust me.

44:39.843 --> 44:41.136
He's exactly where we want him.
