WEBVTT

00:27.236 --> 00:28.612
You must be Sewon.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.491
My name is Taesuk Myung.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.619
I am a brain scientist.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.344
Check the emergency staircase.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.913
Nurse! Nurse!

01:39.933 --> 01:41.226
Grab him! Hurry!

02:04.374 --> 02:05.375
Shit...

02:09.713 --> 02:14.343
DR. BRAIN

02:32.819 --> 02:34.613
Are you sure he's here?

02:34.696 --> 02:37.157
The bus driver said he got off here.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.827
Damn, we're in the middle of nowhere.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.429
He came to join
our temple program late last night.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.559
Soon, morning service
will start at the temple.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.561
So you might find him there.

03:48.687 --> 03:50.230
Thank you very much.

04:34.191 --> 04:38.695
This way. Unless there is a special event,
the service is in the main temple.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.595
Gee, you're as slippery as an eel.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.015
You thought I wouldn't find you?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.354
Please!

05:14.857 --> 05:15.816
I beg you!

05:17.526 --> 05:18.652
Why?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.488
Why would you do something so foolish?

05:30.622 --> 05:33.542
-Don't put this on me, all right?
-Wait!

05:34.501 --> 05:35.502
Don't move!

05:43.969 --> 05:44.803
Shit!

07:18.021 --> 07:19.606
Go on, scream.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.233
I'm a fair guy.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.986
I handle children just like adults.

07:25.404 --> 07:26.446
Jaemin?

07:28.866 --> 07:29.700
Jaemin!

07:30.617 --> 07:32.244
What are you doing?

07:32.327 --> 07:33.579
Come on. You can't go in there.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.790
Come here. We've been looking for you.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.001
Let's go somewhere else.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.152
Namil Hong?

08:09.948 --> 08:10.908
Namil Hong!

08:13.243 --> 08:14.328
I'm a police officer.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.261
Sergeant Park.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.344
Sewon, watch your step.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.388
Isn't this a lovely house?

09:58.849 --> 10:00.058
Hello.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.022
Can you say hello to Dr. Myung, please?

10:06.773 --> 10:08.650
So nice to see you, Sewon.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.654
Now that your mom is no longer with us,

10:12.738 --> 10:15.199
you're going to live
at this house with me, okay?

10:16.408 --> 10:18.785
Let's go pick your room.

10:21.622 --> 10:24.917
Pick your favorite, okay?
There are many to choose from.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.769
You like this one?

11:31.733 --> 11:34.945
Okay, then. This is your room now.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.860
You're already studying quantum mechanics?

12:14.943 --> 12:18.363
I'm interested in these concepts,
so I've been applying them.

12:19.198 --> 12:23.452
Oh, really? So what are your theories?

12:25.329 --> 12:29.416
If we can induce entanglement
between two brains,

12:31.293 --> 12:33.962
my theory is that the brains
could communicate with each other.

12:34.421 --> 12:39.176
Using quantum mechanics
to communicate between brains?

12:41.470 --> 12:43.597
That's some hypothesis!

12:44.848 --> 12:45.682
But...

12:46.600 --> 12:51.146
Shouldn't you be looking into
something more practical and realistic?

12:57.819 --> 13:01.907
This theory is practical enough,
and very realistic.

13:04.409 --> 13:05.786
And I will prove it to you.

13:09.081 --> 13:11.750
A company in San Jose has agreed

13:11.834 --> 13:15.295
to invest a lot of money in our research.

13:17.381 --> 13:20.676
And to think that
everyone in Korea turned us down.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.596
In San Jose, they recognize
the value of our work.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.307
I looked into this investor.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.853
He's only interested in research
that can make him money.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.146
Don't you find it odd?

13:33.814 --> 13:36.066
He might make unethical demands.

13:36.149 --> 13:36.984
Sewon...

13:38.026 --> 13:40.529
We may never get
an opportunity like this again.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.072
You're wrong.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.491
I believe he's using you.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.328
You know it too, but you want the money.

13:48.412 --> 13:49.621
Sewon!

13:53.667 --> 13:55.252
I'm not going to the US.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.883
And I believe it's time I left this place.

14:04.887 --> 14:05.888
Thank you for dinner.

14:34.708 --> 14:39.338
Oh, my. Look at you.
You don't look so good.

14:40.672 --> 14:43.300
How long has it been?

14:43.884 --> 14:47.554
Why did it take you so long
to come see me?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.693
This is Yoon, my personal secretary.

15:02.194 --> 15:05.113
He's been very helpful
in my given condition.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.578
I just came from Saera Clinic.

15:11.662 --> 15:14.373
Oh good. So you met Dr. Hyun, didn't you?

15:14.456 --> 15:16.875
I saw a picture of you
and your team in the US.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.044
Ah, such brilliant minds.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.630
You'll get to actually
meet them very soon.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.757
I'm already familiar with most of them.

15:26.885 --> 15:30.931
I know you had something to do
with Doyoon's disappearance.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.603
Where is my son?

15:44.236 --> 15:46.864
Is that anger you're expressing?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.617
You can express emotions now?

15:51.660 --> 15:54.079
I wonder how that happened.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.123
I'm not here for conversation.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.084
I want to see my son right now!

16:01.670 --> 16:02.671
All right.

16:03.463 --> 16:07.509
I understand how you feel about your son.
I feel the same way about you.

16:08.177 --> 16:10.387
But first...

16:11.263 --> 16:13.265
Keep talking to him. I'll be back.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.571
But first, listen to what I have to say.

16:28.739 --> 16:31.783
Hopefully, you'll make the right choice.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.759
Tell me everything
about the person behind this.

16:55.474 --> 16:57.392
An innocent officer is dead,

16:59.394 --> 17:01.855
a man like a brother to me,
my colleague of ten years,

17:03.190 --> 17:04.650
because of you.

17:10.531 --> 17:12.156
And then there's your mother...

17:13.325 --> 17:16.244
Her life was threatened,
and she lost a finger.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.122
What?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.165
The bastard tortured her.

17:22.376 --> 17:25.628
She never uttered a word
in order to keep you protected.

17:47.818 --> 17:49.111
There are more...

17:50.654 --> 17:52.823
innocent people who died because of me.

17:54.283 --> 17:58.954
I've had three great
opportunities in my life.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.331
And I seized all of them.

18:02.499 --> 18:05.794
The first one was meeting you, Sewon.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.255
My inspiration for this research project.

18:09.131 --> 18:15.512
The second was
securing funding to go to the US.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.600
12 YEARS AGO
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA

18:24.688 --> 18:27.357
This talented young man is Dr. Hong.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.234
He's a rising star in neural nets,

18:29.318 --> 18:32.196
machine learning,
and digital neuron modeling.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.365
- Nice to meet you. I'm Soojung Hyun.
- I'm Namil Hong.

18:35.449 --> 18:36.658
And I'm Yoojin.

18:36.742 --> 18:37.784
Nice to meet you.

18:39.870 --> 18:43.290
At the time, I thought I'd never get
an opportunity like that again.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.169
Um, excuse me...

18:47.794 --> 18:50.964
Why is it that none of these people
have emergency contacts?

18:51.048 --> 18:52.883
Most of them suffer from malnutrition.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.177
Maybe they need extra care then.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.473
That's when I knew...

19:01.016 --> 19:03.185
that something wasn't right.

19:04.770 --> 19:08.273
These were homeless people
taken from shelters.

19:09.024 --> 19:11.944
No one would fight for them
if anything went wrong.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.612
They were powerless.

19:15.572 --> 19:20.160
- Increase the stimulation to 14 hertz.
- Increasing to 14 hertz.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.747
His vitals are unstable.
I think we need to stop.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.040
What?

19:25.123 --> 19:27.125
No, I think we need to continue.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.128
If we stop now, the data will be useless.

19:30.712 --> 19:32.673
-Push it to 170--
- Wait!

19:33.257 --> 19:35.592
No, no! It's too dangerous!

19:35.676 --> 19:36.885
Keep going.

19:37.970 --> 19:41.807
Continuing at 170 hertz at 3.5 volts.

19:51.066 --> 19:54.444
The test subject
lost all of his memories.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.241
But even after that,
the experiments continued.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.577
When did the symptoms begin?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.623
We're at the eleventh hour.

20:09.835 --> 20:11.879
It seems like sensory loss, right?

20:11.962 --> 20:15.215
Yes. Should I note this
as a temporary condition?

20:30.522 --> 20:34.193
Of course, we experienced a period
of trial and error.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.333
One of the subjects died.

20:49.833 --> 20:53.504
Even after the second and third deaths...

20:53.587 --> 20:55.172
We just lost our third subject.

20:56.131 --> 20:58.050
They were obsessed with the research.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.761
Because it almost worked once.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.680
It was unfortunate

21:03.764 --> 21:07.643
but the tests yielded
extremely valuable data.

21:08.560 --> 21:13.941
None of this would have been possible
without the team's dedication.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.860
It was madness.

21:19.321 --> 21:21.031
And it caught up to them.

21:22.115 --> 21:27.204
Insignificant problems
led to severe restrictions.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.541
The government opened
an investigation into the experiment.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.000
Aren't you overreacting?

21:32.417 --> 21:35.462
They agreed to the experiment,
knowing the risks.

21:35.546 --> 21:37.464
This was all done with their consent.

21:37.548 --> 21:39.341
Regardless of what's legal or not,

21:39.424 --> 21:41.552
the problem is that we used
homeless people.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.929
I understand why the investor is anxious.

21:44.012 --> 21:47.474
This exposure could be very damaging
to him and to his company.

21:47.558 --> 21:49.977
This means that Dr. Myung,
as the lead researcher,

21:50.060 --> 21:51.436
will be held responsible.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.107
And you also, as a lead researcher
of these experiments.

21:55.190 --> 21:58.026
For now, all of you
have to fly back to Korea.

21:58.110 --> 22:02.447
We must keep
what happened here between us.

22:02.531 --> 22:08.120
And obviously, we have to make sure
that we never betray one another.

22:13.542 --> 22:15.043
What does my son have to do with this?

22:15.127 --> 22:17.254
Listen to the rest of my story!

22:19.047 --> 22:23.218
Officially, we stopped the experiments.

22:23.302 --> 22:28.515
Our investor and I couldn't abandon
what progress we made in San Jose

22:28.599 --> 22:32.561
and give up on the experiments.

22:32.644 --> 22:36.273
So, we came back home

22:36.982 --> 22:40.485
and continued the research in secret.

22:42.654 --> 22:44.114
Once in a while,

22:44.615 --> 22:48.410
you gave us useful hints.

22:49.661 --> 22:51.246
What are you talking about?

22:51.330 --> 22:52.623
Sewon...

22:53.665 --> 22:57.878
We were actually partners the whole time.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.759
Was Dr. Hong monitoring me?

23:04.635 --> 23:06.303
I had no choice.

23:07.346 --> 23:10.098
If I refused, who knows
what they would have done to me.

23:11.058 --> 23:13.769
Dr. Yoojin was appointed
director of the BC Medical Center.

23:14.478 --> 23:16.980
They told me to act as Sewon's assistant

23:17.064 --> 23:19.733
and share the lab reports with them.

23:20.609 --> 23:22.402
They wanted me to be a spy.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.830
COPYING 41 FILES FROM BC MEDICAL
65% COMPLETE

23:36.625 --> 23:39.878
But as time passed,
I became more fond of him.

23:42.464 --> 23:45.342
I would like to apply
your research data to axion voltage.

23:48.846 --> 23:49.930
Really?

23:50.013 --> 23:52.975
Yes, it's a little better
than the preexisting research data.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.810
I really grew to like the guy.

23:55.394 --> 23:58.230
I know it's hard to believe,
but it's true.

23:58.313 --> 24:00.190
What are we waiting for? Let's do it!

24:06.488 --> 24:10.450
We're still waiting on the results,
so I'll check once we get them.

24:16.999 --> 24:20.794
But then, a tragedy happened.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.763
Everyone thought Sewon was crazy

24:32.764 --> 24:36.643
for showing up to work
the day after his son's funeral.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.856
Sewon, you okay?

24:41.398 --> 24:42.399
No.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.945
I'm having trouble with the fiber optics.

24:47.029 --> 24:50.407
No, not that. I'm talking about you.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.328
I'm sorry.

24:56.246 --> 24:59.791
I can't imagine how you feel,

25:00.417 --> 25:02.044
how heartbroken you must be.

25:03.712 --> 25:05.589
I can't even imagine.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.635
A broken heart...

25:11.136 --> 25:12.513
doesn't change a thing.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.019
Is your wife okay?

25:19.102 --> 25:20.854
She's acting irrationally.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.815
She's going through a lot.

25:25.651 --> 25:26.860
She thinks Doyoon is alive.

25:28.111 --> 25:32.658
She's suffering from hallucinations
due to severe stress.

25:34.535 --> 25:36.161
Please start the centrifuge.

25:47.464 --> 25:51.468
And Dr. Koh's wife tried
committing suicide not long after that?

25:52.719 --> 25:53.846
Yes.

25:53.929 --> 25:58.600
And did Dr. Koh seem suspicious
at any time about what happened to her?

25:58.684 --> 26:00.060
No, he didn't.

26:02.062 --> 26:04.439
He didn't act differently at all,
which made me feel sorry for him.

26:05.399 --> 26:07.025
I didn't see any difference.

26:08.026 --> 26:08.861
Until...

26:10.279 --> 26:11.280
Until what?

26:12.948 --> 26:14.950
Until a man came to see me.

26:26.378 --> 26:27.921
There was something
suspicious about him.

26:28.005 --> 26:30.299
Dr. Namil Hong?

26:30.382 --> 26:32.551
Yes, hello. How can I help you?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.720
You work with Dr. Sewon Koh, yes?

26:35.429 --> 26:36.680
I do. Who are you?

26:39.808 --> 26:42.519
I'm an investigator
from Hanshin Life Insurance.

26:42.603 --> 26:46.523
Dr. Koh recently took out
a policy in his wife's name.

26:46.607 --> 26:51.111
I'm reaching out to a few
of his acquaintances. Just protocol.

26:52.279 --> 26:56.116
I knew that Sewon
was not interested in money.

26:56.825 --> 26:59.953
So I reported it to Dr. Myung,
through Secretary Yoon.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.749
Yoon said he would take care of it.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.377
And then...

27:07.461 --> 27:09.379
Kangmu Lee, a former detective,

27:09.463 --> 27:12.966
has died in a car crash
after his vehicle slipped off the road.

27:13.050 --> 27:15.260
There were no other
passengers in the vehicle.

27:15.344 --> 27:17.846
The police are looking for witnesses.

27:17.930 --> 27:20.140
They believe
he fell asleep at the wheel,

27:20.224 --> 27:21.808
possibly intoxicated.

27:22.851 --> 27:24.269
That's when I realized...

27:26.355 --> 27:29.858
that what happened to Sewon
wasn't a coincidence.

27:29.942 --> 27:31.944
His son died in a fire.

27:33.946 --> 27:35.656
His wife attempted suicide.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.492
And the investigator
looking into him died too.

27:39.493 --> 27:42.204
And it happened right after I,
like an idiot, told Yoon about Kangmu.

27:43.497 --> 27:45.541
Yet you didn't share any of this
with the police.

27:47.209 --> 27:48.585
And you didn't tell Dr. Koh.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.840
I thought they'd kill me if I did.

27:55.342 --> 27:58.846
But that's when an opportunity arose...

28:00.639 --> 28:02.641
And I did something impulsive.

28:04.518 --> 28:09.022
When I found out that
Kangmu's corpse turned up at our morgue...

28:09.857 --> 28:11.483
You have access to the morgue.

28:14.444 --> 28:15.654
Sewon!

28:18.532 --> 28:20.367
If you want it so badly,

28:20.993 --> 28:22.452
I do have an idea.

28:22.536 --> 28:25.831
You mean you purposefully led
Dr. Koh to Kangmu's body?

28:26.832 --> 28:28.000
What for?

28:28.083 --> 28:31.837
I was hoping he'd find something
by syncing with Kangmu.

28:34.631 --> 28:35.966
Sewon...

28:36.884 --> 28:39.595
I'm dying.

28:40.304 --> 28:44.933
Cancer has spread
to almost every organ in my body.

28:45.017 --> 28:48.729
You could say I'm essentially a dead man.

28:50.439 --> 28:52.065
It's a shame, no?

28:52.858 --> 28:56.195
Everything inside of me is rotting.

28:56.778 --> 28:59.072
Don't expect any sympathy from me.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.575
I'm only here for my son.

29:01.658 --> 29:04.036
You spend your life studying and learning,

29:04.119 --> 29:06.747
and just when
you're starting to get it, you die.

29:06.830 --> 29:12.169
Then the newborns arrive
and have to start all over again.

29:13.378 --> 29:16.173
If you want the world to truly progress,

29:16.256 --> 29:19.343
well then, valuable brains
have to be preserved!

29:20.219 --> 29:23.222
And that's why I'm going to take something

29:23.305 --> 29:26.058
which only exists
in science fiction or religion,

29:27.434 --> 29:28.977
and make it reality.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.396
I made the resolution...

29:32.564 --> 29:36.109
And finally, I have succeeded.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.992
Immortality.

29:47.704 --> 29:48.705
Immortality?

29:49.748 --> 29:54.461
Why are you talking about
such a delusional concept right now?

29:54.545 --> 29:56.630
You've experienced it.

29:56.713 --> 29:58.298
If you brain sync with the dead,

29:58.382 --> 30:05.430
their memories, preferences, and habits
are passed on to you.

30:05.514 --> 30:08.684
And so, if you took just a few more steps,

30:08.767 --> 30:13.188
wouldn't you be able to transfer
an entire human consciousness into AI?

30:14.940 --> 30:15.941
Don't tell me...

30:16.567 --> 30:20.487
That's right, Sewon.

30:22.197 --> 30:25.659
I'm going to transfer
my consciousness to your son...

30:26.410 --> 30:29.580
whose brain structure
is the same as yours.

30:29.663 --> 30:33.917
This is my gift to humanity.

30:34.751 --> 30:38.338
An entrance into the realm of gods!

30:55.814 --> 30:59.026
An exceptionally large hippocampus.

31:00.194 --> 31:07.075
Young, lively neurons,
and remarkable neuroplasticity...

31:09.119 --> 31:12.873
Doyoon's brain is truly perfect.

31:14.750 --> 31:21.590
The third great opportunity
that came into my life...

31:23.258 --> 31:26.053
was meeting your son, Doyoon.

31:27.137 --> 31:29.681
Have you lost your goddamn mind?

31:31.225 --> 31:32.851
Son...

31:33.894 --> 31:35.479
You're a scientist.

31:35.562 --> 31:39.191
Don't misunderstand me
with unscientific conjectures.

31:39.274 --> 31:45.656
This isn't simply
a base ambition to extend one's life.

31:45.739 --> 31:49.660
Its value transcends everything.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.162
Can you imagine?

31:54.039 --> 31:58.377
My consciousness in Doyoon's brain.

31:59.670 --> 32:05.926
I will become both
your father and your son.

32:09.137 --> 32:10.973
If what you say is true...

32:12.474 --> 32:14.852
my son will be lost forever.

32:17.187 --> 32:20.190
He'll be nothing but a hollow shell,
you fucking psycho!

32:22.359 --> 32:25.070
Speak! Where is my son?

32:25.153 --> 32:26.280
Tell me!

32:26.363 --> 32:27.614
Tell me!

32:27.698 --> 32:28.907
I said tell me!

32:45.424 --> 32:48.385
You've changed so much.

32:49.469 --> 32:55.142
I admire your willingness
to sacrifice yourself for your son.

32:57.019 --> 33:00.189
You don't want to lose him.

33:02.191 --> 33:05.277
I feel exactly the same about you.

33:06.987 --> 33:09.907
I don't want to lose you either.

33:16.038 --> 33:18.999
I wish I had more time to think it over.

33:20.417 --> 33:22.503
But I'm running out of time.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.965
This old body will soon give out.

33:30.844 --> 33:36.725
It will all be over by this time tomorrow.

33:48.445 --> 33:50.656
I knew they were coming for me.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.367
That's why I ran.

33:53.867 --> 33:58.580
So, you know nothing
about the man who tried to kill you?

34:02.417 --> 34:04.962
Wait... I met him once.

34:07.130 --> 34:07.965
Where?

34:08.590 --> 34:11.592
Secretary Yoon instructed me
to hand him the lab reports.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.594
In a dark alley somewhere.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.639
And after I handed them over...

34:16.974 --> 34:18.559
I think I saw him talking to someone

34:19.351 --> 34:22.771
who runs a temp job agency
or a debt collection company.

34:23.522 --> 34:25.065
I think they knew each other.

35:19.995 --> 35:21.121
QUICK LOANS

35:39.723 --> 35:41.141
I'm looking for someone.

35:41.934 --> 35:43.852
Can you tell me if you know this man?

35:46.772 --> 35:49.066
I can't say. I don't think I've met him.

35:49.775 --> 35:53.654
A lot of people come here
to find temp jobs,

35:53.737 --> 35:56.323
so it's hard for me to remember
every face.

35:57.783 --> 35:58.825
Is that right?

35:58.909 --> 36:01.078
How can I help you remember?

36:23.851 --> 36:26.144
MR. CHANG - RUN

36:42.327 --> 36:45.247
- Hey, that car!
- Damn it...

37:30.709 --> 37:33.212
Alpha-Romeo B9, pursuing suspect!

37:33.295 --> 37:35.881
Block off both sides of Yongin Road!

37:56.026 --> 37:57.736
Ah shit...

38:03.242 --> 38:05.118
Officer Kim, block the road over there.

38:05.202 --> 38:08.580
Excuse me, this is a checkpoint.
Where are you coming from?

38:13.961 --> 38:16.755
Oh, man...

38:25.472 --> 38:26.849
I think this is it.

38:28.225 --> 38:29.893
Vehicle found.

38:30.352 --> 38:31.687
The suspect isn't here.

38:33.939 --> 38:37.025
Yeah... They've blocked the roads.

38:37.693 --> 38:38.694
I'm trapped.

38:41.780 --> 38:45.450
I don't think I can take
the normal routes right now.

38:45.534 --> 38:47.286
Ah shit...

38:48.078 --> 38:49.538
I'm climbing a hill.

38:51.331 --> 38:53.834
Ah, I can see...

38:58.547 --> 39:01.175
the Yongin rest stop from here.

39:01.258 --> 39:04.094
Stay there.
I'll send someone to pick you up.

39:09.933 --> 39:13.645
Will this be a problem for us?

39:14.229 --> 39:16.356
I'll make sure it won't.

40:02.945 --> 40:05.072
Now you know the whole truth...

40:09.201 --> 40:11.745
But they all vanished into thin air.

40:13.872 --> 40:15.082
What are you going to do now?

40:18.335 --> 40:19.503
No idea.

40:23.090 --> 40:25.634
You can't just sit around.
You have to find a way.

40:26.844 --> 40:28.262
We're out of time.

40:30.180 --> 40:32.057
If I don't find Doyoon soon...

40:34.643 --> 40:36.645
he will completely cease to exist.

40:42.943 --> 40:45.529
Jaeyi insisted that
Doyoon was alive, but...

40:49.283 --> 40:50.951
I was lost in my own world.

40:52.202 --> 40:53.245
I...

40:56.915 --> 40:58.709
I ruined my family.

41:02.129 --> 41:04.339
So ultimately, your wife was right.

41:05.716 --> 41:06.925
But...

41:07.634 --> 41:10.012
I wonder how she knew.

41:15.225 --> 41:17.644
Could it be something she saw...

41:19.980 --> 41:21.607
or heard?

41:44.129 --> 41:45.172
Yes, Jaeyi.

41:45.797 --> 41:48.759
She must've seen an important clue.

41:49.468 --> 41:51.553
So, now you know what to do.

41:51.637 --> 41:53.305
But if I'm going to sync with her...

41:54.515 --> 41:55.891
I need Dr. Hong.

41:59.728 --> 42:01.563
Can you forgive him?

42:03.649 --> 42:05.817
I don't have time to worry about that.

42:06.610 --> 42:08.320
I need his help right away.

42:10.989 --> 42:12.407
Where's my phone?

42:21.834 --> 42:23.293
Go ahead, answer the phone.

42:30.717 --> 42:31.760
Hello?

42:32.469 --> 42:33.595
Namil.

42:38.767 --> 42:39.935
Sewon...

42:44.439 --> 42:47.025
- I'm sorry...
- Not now.

42:47.651 --> 42:50.362
Dr. Hong, I need your help.

42:50.445 --> 42:53.615
Tell me. I'll do anything.

42:53.699 --> 42:55.534
I need to sync with Jaeyi one more time.

42:55.617 --> 42:58.787
Syncing brains with a living person
is too unstable!

42:58.871 --> 43:00.581
That's why I need you to help me.

43:01.707 --> 43:03.959
Jaeyi or I could have a seizure.

43:05.127 --> 43:07.254
I need someone to monitor the sync.

43:07.337 --> 43:08.172
Namil...

43:10.090 --> 43:12.509
This is the last chance for me
to find my boy.

43:13.969 --> 43:15.179
Please help me.

43:52.299 --> 43:55.135
Why the fuck are you sitting back here?

43:55.385 --> 43:56.386
Hey, man.

44:01.141 --> 44:02.392
What's up? Let's go.

44:34.633 --> 44:37.636
YONGIN REST STOP

44:43.433 --> 44:45.602
- Where's the car?
- Over there.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.918
- You alone?
- Yeah.

45:15.007 --> 45:16.842
You gonna be okay at the checkpoints?

45:17.551 --> 45:18.886
Don't worry about it.

46:10.145 --> 46:11.188
Fuck!

46:27.329 --> 46:29.248
Did Yoon send you?

46:31.458 --> 46:32.835
Fucking unbelievable.

47:18.005 --> 47:19.715
The entrance is over there.

47:30.434 --> 47:33.979
- Did you call?
- Yes, I think I just saw this man.

47:34.062 --> 47:35.063
Where?

48:01.256 --> 48:03.467
- Block off the whole area.
- Yes, ma'am.

48:35.916 --> 48:37.125
Jaeyi...

48:38.460 --> 48:40.379
Help me find Doyoon.

48:44.049 --> 48:45.968
Sewon. Let's begin.

49:35.809 --> 49:36.643
Oh...

49:37.477 --> 49:38.979
I thought you couldn't make it.

49:48.655 --> 49:49.656
It's been a while.

49:50.199 --> 49:52.701
Huh? This place?

49:54.077 --> 49:57.080
I guess so. Not since we got married.

49:58.415 --> 50:00.584
It's good to see you,
even if it's not real.

50:00.667 --> 50:01.502
Thank goodness.

50:03.795 --> 50:05.464
What's gotten into you?

50:06.590 --> 50:07.424
Jaeyi.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.594
I need to tell you something.

50:11.094 --> 50:11.929
Right now?

50:13.430 --> 50:15.140
Now's not a good time.

50:18.060 --> 50:21.104
When you canceled,
I invited someone else.

50:22.981 --> 50:24.233
It's very important.

50:28.153 --> 50:30.239
This may be difficult
for you to hear or understand.

50:30.322 --> 50:31.240
but hear me out.

50:32.157 --> 50:33.867
Remember the research
I've been working on?

50:34.826 --> 50:38.413
Enabling communication between brains.

50:39.164 --> 50:40.624
I finally made it work.

50:40.707 --> 50:42.334
Which means...

50:44.127 --> 50:45.879
I'm inside your brain.

50:46.672 --> 50:48.507
What are you trying to say?

50:48.590 --> 50:50.467
- You fell into a coma.
- What?

50:50.551 --> 50:52.344
And when that happened...

50:53.846 --> 50:56.098
I threw myself into my work.

50:56.181 --> 50:58.058
So I could save you, speak to you.

50:58.934 --> 51:01.436
This is why we're able to talk right now.

51:01.520 --> 51:03.397
You're being ridiculous.

51:04.731 --> 51:05.607
Jaeyi...

51:09.444 --> 51:10.946
Everything you said was true.

51:12.948 --> 51:14.074
Doyoon...

51:15.325 --> 51:16.910
He's still alive.

51:20.122 --> 51:22.875
I came all the way here to find Doyoon.

51:23.375 --> 51:26.378
I'm trying to find clues in your memories.

51:26.461 --> 51:28.088
So, please help me out.

51:31.675 --> 51:32.509
Why?

51:34.678 --> 51:36.388
Why are you talking nonsense?

51:38.223 --> 51:39.766
What's wrong with you, seriously?

51:42.895 --> 51:43.729
Jaeyi.

51:47.524 --> 51:49.568
What are you doing here, Dr. Koh?

51:50.611 --> 51:52.738
I'm speaking to my wife.

51:52.821 --> 51:54.990
You showing up like this
makes things awkward.

51:55.073 --> 51:56.450
Give us a minute.

51:56.533 --> 51:59.411
Jaeyi? Is that okay?

52:04.708 --> 52:06.919
Let's talk at home later.

52:07.002 --> 52:09.254
Jaeyi, wait. Please listen to me.
This is important.

52:09.338 --> 52:11.340
She doesn't want to.

52:13.759 --> 52:15.219
This only concerns my wife.

52:15.302 --> 52:17.179
Since when are you concerned about her?

52:19.556 --> 52:21.683
Who do you think you are, huh?

52:21.767 --> 52:23.727
This is none of your business!

52:26.772 --> 52:30.234
- Jaeyi, let's go. Let's talk outside.
- What is wrong with you?

52:32.069 --> 52:34.488
You have no right to talk to her
like that!
