MR. MARS, WE HAVE A WARRANT
TO SEARCH YOUR PREMISES.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.080
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?

37:09.120 --> 37:11.884
HASN'T MY DAUGHTER COOPERATED
IN EVERY WAY ASKED?

37:11.930 --> 37:14.490
FUNNY THING HAPPENED
IN BIG BEAR, MR. MARS.

37:14.530 --> 37:16.748
THERE WAS NO SIGN OF DUNCAN KANE
ANYWHERE.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.961
BUT THE MANAGER
OF THE CONDO

37:19.000 --> 37:21.298
DID SHOW A MODEL UNIT TO A CUTE,
YOUNG, BLOND WOMAN.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.262
WE DID FIND
THIS MINI CASSETTE

37:23.300 --> 37:25.302
IN A DUMPSTER
BEHIND THE COMPLEX.

37:25.340 --> 37:27.661
Duncan:
WHERE I AM ISN'T IMPORTANT.
I'M DOING THE RIGHT THING.

37:27.710 --> 37:29.598
THERE'S NO WAY I'LL EVER
GET TO KEEP THE BABY NOW.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.108
I THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND.
I THOUGHT YOU'D HELP.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.106
YOU KNOW WHAT THE MANNINGS
WOULD DO TO HER.

37:34.150 --> 37:37.677
FORGET IT. FORGET IT.
WE'LL GO IT ALONE.

37:38.220 --> 37:39.710
AND I ASKED MYSELF,

37:39.750 --> 37:44.050
"IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE
AN UNREHEARSED CONVERSATION

37:44.090 --> 37:46.581
WITH A TAPE RECORDING?"

37:47.490 --> 37:49.321
I DON'T THINK SO.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.123
SOUNDS LIKE
THEY GOT YOU, HONEY.

37:51.160 --> 37:56.029
WELL, THINK OF THE MONEY
WE'LL SAVE ON A PROM DRESS.

37:56.070 --> 37:59.335
I'M GONNA MAKE A SANDWICH.
ANYONE WANT A SANDWICH?

38:00.470 --> 38:03.405
YOU'RE COOL, MR. MARS.
YOU'RE VERY COOL.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.273
AND YOU GOT
A COOL DAUGHTER.

38:06.310 --> 38:09.939
BUT KIDNAPPING CASES DON'T
GO AWAY. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT.

38:09.980 --> 38:11.618
IS THAT A NO?

38:14.050 --> 38:15.517
ALMOST DONE?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.653
GETTING THERE.

38:18.860 --> 38:21.658
OH, HEY, MAN,
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

38:26.130 --> 38:27.927
WHAT'S THIS?

38:27.970 --> 38:29.528
I WAS GONNA PUT THAT
ON YOUR BUDDY'S CHEST

38:29.570 --> 38:32.835
BEFORE HE
GOT HIMSELF KILLED.

38:32.870 --> 38:36.431
GOOD-LOOKING GIRL.
WHO IS IT?

38:37.780 --> 38:40.669
HER NAME'S
MOLLY FITZPATRICK.

38:42.820 --> 38:46.381
COUPLE OF HOURS AGO HE ASKED ME
WHERE THERE WAS A GROCERY STORE,

38:46.420 --> 38:47.580
BUT I DIDN'T SEE
A BABY.

38:47.620 --> 38:49.087
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

38:49.120 --> 38:52.453
ANOTHER FEW MILES, SOUTH,
PAST THE OLD TRAIN STATION.

38:52.490 --> 38:54.151
THAN KS.

38:54.190 --> 38:56.897
IT MIGHT NOT
BE THE GUY, MAN.

38:56.930 --> 38:58.795

TO SEE YOUR DADDY?

40:26.020 --> 40:28.557
SHE WON'T
LET GO OF MY FINGER.

40:28.590 --> 40:30.751
SHE THINKS
YOU'RE VERONICA.

40:30.790 --> 40:32.678
YEAH, SO DOES THE FBI.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.522
