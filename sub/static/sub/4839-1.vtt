02:23.564 --> 02:25.566
Exactly what
Pastor Kingsman said...

02:25.733 --> 02:28.202
you take a...
off the turnpike, six miles on...

02:28.361 --> 02:30.580
- He doesn't know.
- I didn't think so.

02:30.738 --> 02:32.539
What's it called...
the first road? Lime Road?

02:32.615 --> 02:34.959
- Old Lime Road.
- Rebecca, help your dad out here.

02:35.117 --> 02:37.245
Rebecca.

02:37.411 --> 02:39.413
I think we're lost.

02:42.166 --> 02:43.918
- Sorry, Dad.
- Okay. All right.

02:44.085 --> 02:45.646
- I saw these before.
- Saw what?

02:45.795 --> 02:47.889
This. It all looks the same.
I don't know.

02:48.047 --> 02:49.727
If you took the right,
left at the right...

02:49.799 --> 02:51.919
- You can't even hit me back.
- ... at the right barn.

02:52.009 --> 02:53.886
Or was it the left, left
at the right barn?

02:54.053 --> 02:56.272
Do you remember
when he took the wrong exit?

02:56.430 --> 02:57.977
- Right?
- We ended up going...

02:58.140 --> 02:59.860
- No, no, that's not...
- Twice.

02:59.934 --> 03:01.535
- No, that's not true.
- He did it twice.

03:01.602 --> 03:03.195
- It was not properly marked.
- He did it twice.

03:03.354 --> 03:05.314
- It was not properly marked.
- You circled twice.

03:07.942 --> 03:09.615
Okay, ha-ha.
Listen, this is...

03:09.777 --> 03:11.950
that was the right barn.

03:12.113 --> 03:13.873
I'm pretty sure
that this was the right road.

03:13.989 --> 03:15.457
Well, I mean,

03:15.616 --> 03:18.916
it's not that I don't trust your
keen sense of judgment, Captain,

03:19.078 --> 03:21.797
but why don't we just
stop and ask?

03:23.791 --> 03:25.634
There's an idea.

03:25.793 --> 03:27.591
Come on, ask, ask.

03:27.753 --> 03:29.630
Ask, ask, ask, ask.

03:29.797 --> 03:31.799
Ask, ask ask.

03:31.966 --> 03:34.185
I'm gonna go in here
and check it out.

03:35.344 --> 03:37.972
- I listen to my family.
- Wrong turn.

03:38.139 --> 03:41.313
Is there... is there...
is there a fellow there?

03:41.475 --> 03:43.944
Oh, my God.

03:44.103 --> 03:46.447
Oh, my God.

03:52.278 --> 03:54.155
That's enough.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.415
Whew!

03:56.574 --> 03:58.167
Hallelujah!

03:58.325 --> 04:00.669
All right,
there is a word I like to hear.

04:00.828 --> 04:04.253
Let's be saying it
when we find out where we are.

04:06.292 --> 04:08.670
Oh, that's nice.
Isn't that pretty?

04:10.421 --> 04:12.469
For the tenth time
that we've seen it today.

04:12.631 --> 04:14.224
I know.

04:14.383 --> 04:16.351
Sorry, Dan.

04:16.510 --> 04:18.512
I'll go up and check.

04:19.846 --> 04:21.527
- Okay, Christopher.
- Take the boy.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.859
- Let's go.
- Dad.

04:24.018 --> 04:25.861
See you in a minute.

04:26.020 --> 04:27.897
Good luck.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.453
Something tells me
this town won't have a mall.

04:38.616 --> 04:40.493
A mall?

04:40.659 --> 04:43.708
Come on, I'll settle
for indoor bathrooms.

04:58.093 --> 05:00.095
Hello?

05:04.892 --> 05:06.940
Hello! Anyone here?

05:12.691 --> 05:14.693
Hello!

05:33.546 --> 05:35.799
Excuse me.
You folks looking for something?

05:35.965 --> 05:39.265
Sorry. Yeah, we saw
your farm here and...

05:39.426 --> 05:40.769
You lost or something?

05:40.928 --> 05:44.057
Well, to be honest,
I think we may be a little lost.

05:44.223 --> 05:46.601
There's a gas station a couple
miles back the way you came.

05:46.767 --> 05:48.565
You can get a map from them.

05:48.727 --> 05:51.822
Okay. I was just... I was just
looking for a town called Stull.

05:51.981 --> 05:55.235
I think we took a wrong turn
a mile or so back.

05:55.401 --> 05:57.801
So we'll get out of your hair.
Sorry for having bothered you.

05:57.820 --> 06:00.448
You wouldn't be
the new pastor, would you?

06:00.614 --> 06:03.743
Well, actually, yes.
How did you know that?

06:03.909 --> 06:06.628
Well, Pastor Kingsman asked me
to keep an eye out for you,

06:06.787 --> 06:08.915
make sure you're okay.

06:09.081 --> 06:11.880
I'm just so glad
that you made it, Pastor.

06:12.042 --> 06:13.562
I was starting to get
a little worried.

06:13.586 --> 06:15.213
Your moving truck passed by
a couple of hours ago.

06:15.379 --> 06:17.507
Oh, that's good to hear.

06:17.673 --> 06:19.713
I know my wife will certainly
be happy to hear that.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.347
Are we far from town?

06:21.510 --> 06:25.811
Oh, no, no, not at all,
just a couple of miles or so.

06:25.973 --> 06:28.817
I'm Pastor Dan Bramford.
Nice to meet you.

06:28.976 --> 06:30.819
This is my son Christopher.
Christopher.

06:30.978 --> 06:33.322
<i>Oh, got a good QTâ€œ)
on you, boy .</i>

06:33.480 --> 06:35.232
Yeah.

06:35.399 --> 06:38.494
I'm... I'm Mason.

06:38.652 --> 06:40.325
Nice to meet you.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.034
I'll just...

06:42.197 --> 06:44.666
I'll just bring my truck around.
You can follow me.

06:44.825 --> 06:46.498
Okay, that's great.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.162
I told you we weren't lost.

07:10.643 --> 07:12.441
Hey! Honey!

07:12.603 --> 07:14.901
Welcome to Stull!

07:15.064 --> 07:16.657
Oh, no.
You gotta be kidding me.

07:16.815 --> 07:19.864
Give me five.
I got you here.

07:20.027 --> 07:21.870
You did it.

07:22.029 --> 07:24.873
I hate to say I told you so.

07:25.032 --> 07:26.912
- All right.
- He's gonna come by with the truck

07:26.992 --> 07:28.539
and pick us up,
show us into town.

07:38.337 --> 07:40.886
Oh, my God, what the hell
is that guy doing?

07:41.048 --> 07:42.766
I don't know.

08:13.414 --> 08:16.418
Oh. Oh, yuck.

08:16.583 --> 08:19.257
Well, that is just not appropriate
for you to see.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.093
- Eww.
- You, too.

08:21.255 --> 08:24.350
- In the car. In the car.
- Come on, guys.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.183
- Are you folks ready?
- Yeah, we are.

08:28.345 --> 08:30.473
I'll just drive right up there
and wait for you.

08:30.639 --> 08:32.607
Thank you, Mason.

08:32.765 --> 08:35.940
All right, kids just got
their first taste of the country.

08:51.243 --> 08:53.621
We won't need these anymore.

08:57.499 --> 08:59.419
It's not as small
as you thought it was, Rebecca.

08:59.460 --> 09:02.054
- This is Main Street?
- What's that?

09:02.212 --> 09:04.135
- Ice cream?
- Look.

09:04.298 --> 09:08.053
Christopher wants to go there.

09:23.317 --> 09:26.321
- Is that us?
- I think.

09:27.571 --> 09:29.665
- Is that us right there?
- This is...

09:29.823 --> 09:31.343
- Is that it? Oh!
- Are you kidding me?

09:31.408 --> 09:32.534
- That's it.
- Oh.

09:32.701 --> 09:34.703
- Can you believe it?
- Ma'am, I'm sorry

09:34.870 --> 09:36.918
I didn't get a chance to meet you
back at the farm, but I'm Mason.

09:37.081 --> 09:38.958
Oh, I'm Wendy.

09:39.124 --> 09:40.844
- This is gorgeous.
- Oh my goodness.

09:40.918 --> 09:42.636
I'm glad you like it.

09:42.795 --> 09:44.889
I'm just glad I showed you
where it was.

09:45.047 --> 09:46.924
Oh, my.

09:47.091 --> 09:50.345
Can you... what's...
it's amazing.

09:51.553 --> 09:53.476
Um, hi. Hi.

09:53.639 --> 09:55.607
Excuse me.

09:55.766 --> 09:57.985
Be careful.

10:03.232 --> 10:06.031
Becky... uh, Rebecca.

10:06.193 --> 10:08.446
It's okay, Dad.
You can still call me Becky.

10:08.612 --> 10:11.707
It's... it's really nice.

10:11.865 --> 10:13.367
Yeah.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.453
Big change.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.622
I know that you are gonna
make the most of it.

10:18.789 --> 10:20.507
Excuse me. Hi.
Thank you.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.293
I gotta go help your mom.

10:22.459 --> 10:23.927
I... I'm sorry.
Can you help me?

10:24.086 --> 10:25.806
I'm so confused.
Where are the movers and...

10:25.879 --> 10:27.722
Let me help you.

10:27.881 --> 10:29.474
I don't know what's going on.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.385
Did the movers just leave
everything on the ground?

10:31.552 --> 10:33.099
No, no, no, they were nice fellows.
We just figured

10:33.262 --> 10:35.230
you didn't want any strangers
traipsing through your house.

10:35.389 --> 10:36.990
Some fellows from church
came by to help.

10:37.057 --> 10:38.900
- Pastor Kingsman.
- Oh, Pastor Bramford.

10:39.059 --> 10:40.606
- How are you?
- Good. Good.

10:40.769 --> 10:42.370
I thought you were a mover.
I'm so sorry.

10:42.396 --> 10:44.364
Well, today I'm a mover.
Who knows what I'll be tomorrow?

10:44.523 --> 10:48.369
I know I speak for everybody when I say
we're awfully glad you're here.

10:48.527 --> 10:50.279
- Thank you.
- Well, I think six states,

10:50.445 --> 10:52.288
three children,
countless rest stops...

10:52.447 --> 10:55.576
- I think no one's happier than we are.
- I expect that's true.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.961
- Here, Dan.
- Sure.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.747
- Fragile.
- Yeah, should we?

10:59.913 --> 11:01.711
- Dining room?
- Dining room, gents.

11:01.874 --> 11:04.593
- All right, let's go.
- You be the captain out there.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.378
Captain, I know.
Thank you.

11:08.422 --> 11:11.551
Oh, yeah. Excuse me,
I think that goes into the living room.

11:11.717 --> 11:13.970
Thank you.
Hi, sweetheart.

11:14.136 --> 11:16.309
- Hi.
- Can you believe it?

11:16.471 --> 11:18.940
Um, kitchen.
Thank you.

11:22.186 --> 11:23.733
<i>Okay</i>

11:25.189 --> 11:27.487
- Can you believe it?
- This place is so nice.

11:27.649 --> 11:30.277
- This place is huge.
- I know, right?

11:30.444 --> 11:33.038
- Mom, can I pick out my room?
- Well, yes, after your sisters,

11:33.197 --> 11:35.120
'cause they're older than you,
so they get first choice.

11:35.282 --> 11:37.159
- First choice?
- First choice.

11:37.326 --> 11:39.487
- Second choice.
- Hey, girls, Christopher,

11:39.494 --> 11:41.337
please say hello
to Pastor Kingsman.

11:41.496 --> 11:43.089
The man responsible
for all of this.

11:43.248 --> 11:45.342
Oh, well, I wouldn't say
I'm responsible.

11:45.500 --> 11:48.003
I think a higher power
called you to our little town.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.638
Well, certainly.
Thank you.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.798
It's nice to meet you, girls.

11:51.965 --> 11:53.683
- Nice to meet you.
- Go. Get up there.

11:53.842 --> 11:55.970
- Stop pushing me.
- I'll help.

11:56.136 --> 11:58.059
Stop.

12:02.684 --> 12:04.436
- I like the window in here.
- This room is cool.

12:04.603 --> 12:06.697
I saw it first. I call dibs.

12:06.855 --> 12:08.072
You heard what Mom said.

12:08.232 --> 12:09.952
I'm older than you.
I get first dibs, kiddo.

12:10.108 --> 12:11.985
Second dibs.

12:12.152 --> 12:14.200
Second's better
than the third, you weirdo.

12:14.363 --> 12:17.412
What?
You didn't get the crappy third one.

13:07.374 --> 13:10.127
Damn it.
Let me guess.

13:10.294 --> 13:12.342
Yep. Mine.

13:40.866 --> 13:41.867
Mom!

13:42.034 --> 13:44.708
Oh, thank you so much.

13:44.870 --> 13:48.625
This is incredible.
Everybody's so... so sweet.

13:48.790 --> 13:51.259
- And this kitchen is amazing.
- Well, I'm glad you like it.

13:51.418 --> 13:53.671
I'm not much of a cook myself,
so I have to take your word for it.

13:53.837 --> 13:55.714
- That's not your handiwork?
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:55.881 --> 13:57.929
- That's... that's Mrs. Gordon's.
- Oh.

13:58.091 --> 14:00.560
She... she's pretty famous
for her cakes around here.

14:00.719 --> 14:02.596
- Looks delicious.
- They're good.

14:02.763 --> 14:05.516
Yeah, melt your tongue
right off.

14:05.682 --> 14:07.935
So, Dan,

14:08.101 --> 14:09.861
what do you say
we rip the Band-Aid right off

14:09.936 --> 14:11.456
and get you up
on that pulpit tomorrow?

14:11.605 --> 14:13.482
- Oh. Oh. Oh.
- Oh my goodness, Dan.

14:13.648 --> 14:16.697
- I'm not sure that I'm ready.
- I know it's quick,

14:16.860 --> 14:18.701
but folks are anxious
to meet their new pastor.

14:18.737 --> 14:20.910
Well, you know,
he's got big shoes to fill.

14:21.073 --> 14:22.950
- I'm sure they're gonna miss you a lot.
- No, no, no.

14:23.116 --> 14:26.245
I've been here a number of years.
They're about ready to see me move on.

14:26.411 --> 14:29.506
- No.
- I'm looking forward to retirement.

14:29.664 --> 14:32.508
I think it's about time
we had some new blood around here.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.715
- Oh.
- Well...

14:34.878 --> 14:37.347
- Come on, sweetie.
- What do you say?

14:37.506 --> 14:39.008
Rip the Band-Aid right off.

14:39.174 --> 14:40.801
- Huh?
- All right.

14:54.815 --> 14:56.988
How's the sermon going?

14:57.150 --> 14:59.152
Oh, fine. Good.

14:59.319 --> 15:01.993
The usual battle.

15:02.155 --> 15:03.498
How are the girls?

15:03.657 --> 15:05.659
They're good.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.836
You did the right thing,
you know.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.669
The house is perfect.

15:11.832 --> 15:15.006
I'm almost finished unpacking
downstairs. It looks so good.

15:16.711 --> 15:19.009
I'm glad you're happy with it.

15:19.172 --> 15:21.846
I think moving is always
hardest on the children.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.727
- Yes, I know.
- The new school, the new friends.

15:24.886 --> 15:27.309
They'll adjust.
You know they will.

15:27.472 --> 15:30.021
I think they're gonna like it.

15:31.518 --> 15:33.361
It's not like we had
that much of a choice.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.397
- No?
- No.

15:35.564 --> 15:37.441
- We have a bigger boss.
- Oh.

15:37.607 --> 15:39.951
He called you to be here.

15:41.528 --> 15:44.247
As long as we're together,
that's all...

15:44.406 --> 15:46.784
- Nothing else matters.
- Nothing else matters.

15:55.876 --> 15:59.255
I'm going with two years.

15:59.421 --> 16:01.924
What, too little?
10 years.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.684
10 years?
Are you kidding me?

16:04.843 --> 16:07.722
No, they live
for about 45 days.

16:07.888 --> 16:11.313
The stronger ones can live
a little longer, like 60 days.

16:11.475 --> 16:14.103
10 years...
they'd have grey hair.

16:15.479 --> 16:18.403
Yeah, I guess 10 years is kind of
a long time for an ant to live, huh?

16:18.565 --> 16:20.442
Yeah.

16:20.609 --> 16:24.034
Rebecca, do you think
I'll make friends here?

16:24.196 --> 16:26.073
You kidding me?

16:26.239 --> 16:28.412
You? Mr. Personality?

16:28.575 --> 16:30.828
Of course you're gonna
make friends.

16:30.994 --> 16:33.275
Think about how much
a big city slicker kid like you knows

16:33.371 --> 16:34.748
compared to these guys.

16:34.915 --> 16:37.418
Mary, honey.

16:37.584 --> 16:39.336
- Guys.
- What?

16:39.503 --> 16:42.256
- Are they here?
- Mary, come here, please.

16:42.422 --> 16:44.766
- Put that away. Turn off the light.
- Hi. Here.

16:44.925 --> 16:47.769
It's our first night here and I just
wanted to say a little something.

16:47.928 --> 16:49.930
Come on.

16:52.557 --> 16:54.685
Hey.
A big change for us.

16:54.851 --> 16:56.774
And your mother and I
would like you to know

16:56.937 --> 16:58.735
how much we appreciate
the love and support

16:58.897 --> 17:02.868
that each one of you has given us
on our journey.

17:03.026 --> 17:05.119
I think we had a great life
in the city,

17:05.278 --> 17:08.327
but I believe the Lord
has called us here.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.163
He didn't call me.

17:10.325 --> 17:12.292
Okay, all right, He called.

17:12.452 --> 17:14.796
Okay, put our hands together.

17:14.954 --> 17:17.708
Heavenly Father, thank You
for protecting us

17:17.874 --> 17:19.251
on our long journey.

17:19.416 --> 17:21.670
Please, we ask You
to watch over us and guide us...

18:32.741 --> 18:34.288
Wait up for us.

18:36.494 --> 18:38.496
Oh, good morning.

18:42.042 --> 18:43.385
Good morning.
Good morning.

19:15.367 --> 19:16.789
Good morning, friends.

19:16.951 --> 19:18.453
Good morning.

19:18.620 --> 19:21.419
Now before I get started,
I promised Mr. Roberts

19:21.581 --> 19:24.505
that I would mention that we
still need a few volunteers

19:24.668 --> 19:26.762
to help us set up
for tomorrow's summer festival,

19:26.920 --> 19:29.139
so if you have
a little extra time

19:29.297 --> 19:31.015
and want to lend
a helping hand,

19:31.174 --> 19:33.472
please see Carl
after the service.

19:33.635 --> 19:35.353
Please be seated.

19:41.851 --> 19:44.604
I have spent a lot of years

19:44.771 --> 19:46.614
here with you

19:46.773 --> 19:50.653
and I would like to believe
that through all those years

19:50.819 --> 19:53.993
we have built a community
of love and faith.

19:56.366 --> 19:58.243
I would also like to believe

19:58.410 --> 20:01.755
that we have learned
to trust each other.

20:03.331 --> 20:06.551
Now trust is
a very funny thing.

20:06.710 --> 20:10.965
It requires absolute belief
in one's soul, a complete faith.

20:11.131 --> 20:13.429
But it's different than faith.

20:13.591 --> 20:16.811
Trust also obligates
the person that is being trusted

20:16.970 --> 20:19.143
to do the best he can.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.184
And so I am asking you
to trust me

20:22.350 --> 20:24.444
one more time

20:24.602 --> 20:26.604
as I prepare to leave you.

20:28.273 --> 20:30.992
Today we welcome the Bramfords.

20:31.151 --> 20:33.028
Pastor Dan,

20:33.194 --> 20:36.118
his lovely wife Wendy
and their three beautiful children

20:36.281 --> 20:38.534
have all consented to join us.

20:38.700 --> 20:41.374
And I trust
that you will show them

20:41.536 --> 20:43.413
the same love and compassion

20:43.580 --> 20:46.299
that you showed me
so many years ago.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.460
The Bramfords

20:48.626 --> 20:51.596
have made a great sacrifice
to be here with us.

20:51.755 --> 20:54.599
So let us welcome them
with open hearts

20:54.758 --> 20:56.635
and open arms.

20:56.801 --> 21:00.021
Pastor Dan, your people.

21:00.180 --> 21:03.480
Thank you.
Thank you.

21:07.604 --> 21:10.198
Thank you, Pastor Kingsman.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.859
- And good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.

21:13.026 --> 21:15.245
First of all I would like
to thank you

21:15.403 --> 21:19.033
for welcoming my family and I
into your lives.

21:20.366 --> 21:22.368
When I first received the offer

21:22.535 --> 21:24.913
to become your pastor
here in Stull,

21:25.079 --> 21:27.377
my wife Wendy and I

21:27.540 --> 21:29.793
were unsure...

21:29.959 --> 21:32.428
unsure about moving a family

21:32.587 --> 21:34.510
halfway across the country,

21:34.672 --> 21:36.800
unsure about leaving behind

21:36.966 --> 21:39.936
a life that we had come
to know and understand,

21:40.094 --> 21:43.268
unsure about a new adventure.

21:45.308 --> 21:47.936
But in times of unsureness,

21:48.102 --> 21:50.446
in times of great decision,

21:50.605 --> 21:53.449
I put my faith in the Lord,

21:53.608 --> 21:55.576
that He would provide for us,

21:55.735 --> 21:58.204
that He had a plan for us.

22:00.073 --> 22:03.919
I think my faith

22:04.077 --> 22:06.956
was like a rock.

22:07.121 --> 22:10.625
I was reminded of
Matthew, chapter 7, verse 24,

22:10.792 --> 22:13.386
which I would like to read to you
this morning.

22:16.923 --> 22:19.802
"Therefore whosoever heareth
these sayings of mine

22:19.968 --> 22:22.471
and doeth them,

22:22.637 --> 22:25.857
I will liken him
unto a wise man

22:26.015 --> 22:28.939
which built his house
on a rock.

22:29.102 --> 22:31.400
And the rain descended

22:31.563 --> 22:33.440
and the floods came
and the winds blew

22:33.606 --> 22:35.779
and beat upon that house.

22:35.942 --> 22:37.819
And it fell not,

22:37.986 --> 22:41.286
for it was founded upon a rock.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.950
And everyone that heareth
these sayings of mine

22:44.117 --> 22:47.246
and doeth them not
shall be likened to a foolish man

22:47.412 --> 22:50.416
which built his house
upon the sand."

22:54.168 --> 22:56.045
So nice to meet you.

22:56.212 --> 22:58.214
God bless. Thank you.

23:01.759 --> 23:04.137
Thank you.

23:13.354 --> 23:15.732
Not really your scene, huh?

23:17.191 --> 23:18.568
What?

23:18.735 --> 23:20.408
This whole thing.

23:20.570 --> 23:22.197
I saw you inside.
You weren't singing.

23:22.363 --> 23:24.582
And then you left
during the sermon.

23:24.741 --> 23:26.789
I could say the same for you.

23:26.951 --> 23:29.545
Sounds like you were paying
more attention to what I was doing.

23:29.704 --> 23:31.581
Well, maybe,

23:31.748 --> 23:33.750
but that's just 'cause you were
so obviously not into it.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.466
Yeah, you're right.
I'm not much into singing

23:36.628 --> 23:38.756
and just not big
on the whole sermon thing.

23:38.922 --> 23:42.096
- No offense to your dad.
- None taken, trust me.

23:42.258 --> 23:45.102
I saw you and your family
when you got into town yesterday.

23:45.261 --> 23:47.138
I take it y'all met Mason.

23:47.305 --> 23:49.182
Oh, Mason?
He's the farm guy?

23:49.349 --> 23:52.353
Yeah. Yeah, the farm guy.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.488
Okay, so then you were
the guy with the lambs and...

23:55.647 --> 23:57.900
Technically they're sheep.

23:58.066 --> 24:01.912
Wow. Well,
you clean up well.

24:06.532 --> 24:09.081
Maybe I'll see you around
and show you the town.

24:09.243 --> 24:12.292
Yeah, cool.
Yeah, that'd be awesome.

24:14.499 --> 24:16.376
"You clean up well"?

24:16.542 --> 24:19.045
Idiot.

24:19.212 --> 24:21.214
I have a hard time believing

24:21.381 --> 24:23.554
that your boxes are unpacked
and your room is clean.

24:23.716 --> 24:25.138
Huh?

24:25.301 --> 24:27.929
Mom, stop. I'm hungry.
Do we have any food in the house?

24:28.096 --> 24:29.598
You're hungry?
Yeah, there's a little something.

24:29.764 --> 24:31.061
I'm sure you can make do.

24:31.224 --> 24:33.477
- And my boxes are unpacked.
- Uh-huh.

24:33.643 --> 24:36.396
- But define clean.
- Exactly what I thought.

24:36.562 --> 24:38.405
You know I hate
living in the mess, honey.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.408
Relax. It's only been a day.
They're just boxes.

24:41.567 --> 24:44.036
- Breathe.
- I'll breathe when you help me out.

24:44.195 --> 24:46.118
Oh, yeah.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.658
Okay, we are definitely
gonna need an escape plan.

24:48.825 --> 24:49.951
She's driving me nuts.

24:50.118 --> 24:52.120
I swear, if she brings up unpacking
one more time, I'm gonna kill her.

24:52.286 --> 24:55.130
I'm serious. We need a plan.

24:55.289 --> 24:57.166
Okay, like you mean the time
that we told Mom

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
we were going to Sonia Rosen's
house to sleep over,

24:59.419 --> 25:00.921
so that we could see
the Stone Roses?

25:01.087 --> 25:03.607
Yeah, we probably should have told
Sonia Martin about that plan.

25:03.631 --> 25:05.679
- Somehow I got blamed for that one.
- You did not.

25:05.842 --> 25:08.641
I got it way worse than you.
I was grounded for, like, two months.

25:08.803 --> 25:11.226
Remember? Because I should
have known better.

25:11.389 --> 25:14.063
Yeah, you should have known better.

25:14.225 --> 25:16.353
Hey, what are you eating?
I'm starving.

25:16.519 --> 25:18.738
Just peanut butter and jam
I found on the counter.

25:18.896 --> 25:21.274
Mm, sounds appetizing.

25:23.568 --> 25:25.991
Um, I would not do that
if I were you.

25:26.154 --> 25:28.194
Mom said we're saving that
for after dinner tonight.

25:28.239 --> 25:30.458
It's our first family dinner
in the new home,

25:30.616 --> 25:32.118
blah, blah, blah.

25:32.285 --> 25:34.083
Oh, please.

25:34.245 --> 25:36.873
No, seriously, dude, you know
how Mom gets about that shit.

25:38.041 --> 25:40.135
None for me, thanks,
but when Mom kills you,

25:40.293 --> 25:42.637
- I'll take your purple sweater.
- Fine.

25:54.015 --> 25:56.894
Mm, so good.

26:04.776 --> 26:07.074
Are you okay?

26:08.071 --> 26:10.699
Mary!

26:10.865 --> 26:13.288
Oh, shit.

26:17.997 --> 26:19.999
Oh, my God.
Jesus.

26:20.166 --> 26:22.464
- Are you okay?
- What was that?

26:22.627 --> 26:24.629
I have no idea.

26:26.422 --> 26:28.095
Eww.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.348
Oh.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.023
I can't believe this came out.

26:38.643 --> 26:41.237
- I know.
- Holy shit.

26:46.943 --> 26:49.537
Fuck.

26:54.617 --> 26:56.915
Hi. What are you
doing here?

26:57.078 --> 27:00.048
I told you I was gonna take you
around and show you some stuff.

27:00.206 --> 27:01.583
Oh, yeah.

27:01.749 --> 27:03.626
I just didn't know
you meant today.

27:03.793 --> 27:06.137
Is today bad?

27:06.295 --> 27:08.297
No. Come in.

27:13.970 --> 27:15.688
What happened?

27:15.847 --> 27:17.849
You have no idea.

27:20.935 --> 27:23.188
- Who puts a tooth in a cake?
- Tell me about it.

27:23.354 --> 27:25.197
It cut the crap
out of the roof of my mouth.

27:27.108 --> 27:29.031
This is one of
old Mrs. Gordon's cakes.

27:29.193 --> 27:32.197
A nice lady,
but she's almost 95.

27:32.363 --> 27:34.323
Let's just say you're lucky
this is all you found.

27:34.407 --> 27:36.409
Lucky?

27:49.839 --> 27:51.887
There. No more cake.

27:52.049 --> 27:53.926
So are you ready to go?

27:54.093 --> 27:55.595
Um...

27:55.761 --> 27:58.685
Just go, Becca.
I'm fine. Go. Escape.

27:58.848 --> 28:01.317
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll be fine.

28:01.475 --> 28:04.319
A little weirded out,
but I'm fine.

28:04.478 --> 28:06.480
<i>Okay</i>

28:08.357 --> 28:10.359
Bye.

29:20.054 --> 29:22.102
So, not that this hasn't been great,

29:22.265 --> 29:25.018
it has,

29:25.184 --> 29:28.313
but is there anything
to actually do in town?

29:28.479 --> 29:30.652
This isn't exactly
the big city.

29:30.815 --> 29:34.865
I know it's not the big city,
but there's gotta be something.

29:35.027 --> 29:37.155
There really isn't anything to do.

29:38.864 --> 29:41.242
Well, I mean,

29:41.409 --> 29:44.253
could you give me a chance
to figure that out for myself maybe?

29:45.579 --> 29:47.331
Please?

29:47.498 --> 29:49.250
Fine.

30:37.381 --> 30:39.975
So how long
have you lived here?

30:40.134 --> 30:42.182
I don't know.
A long time.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.188
I guess
you're used to it then...

30:45.348 --> 30:47.350
the whole country thing.

30:48.809 --> 30:50.811
No, you never really
get used to it.

30:50.978 --> 30:52.980
You just sort of adapt.

30:56.108 --> 30:59.157
I wasn't exactly thrilled
about moving here,

30:59.320 --> 31:02.540
but it's kind of nice.

31:04.075 --> 31:06.453
- Afternoon.
- Hello.

31:08.412 --> 31:10.631
I should probably get you home.

31:10.790 --> 31:12.133
What?

31:12.291 --> 31:14.293
I thought we were having fun.

31:14.460 --> 31:16.462
It's not that.

31:17.755 --> 31:20.275
It's just it's getting late.
I don't want your parents worrying.

31:20.299 --> 31:21.721
Oh, please.

31:21.884 --> 31:24.307
Noah.

31:24.470 --> 31:27.189
Noah, Pastor Kingsman
is looking for you.

31:27.348 --> 31:28.895
Tell him I'll be there
in a few.

31:29.058 --> 31:30.856
He wants you now.

31:32.395 --> 31:34.272
I've got to go home.

31:34.438 --> 31:36.566
Home?
You live with Pastor Kingsman?

31:36.732 --> 31:38.109
Noah.

31:38.275 --> 31:40.277
I'll explain later.

31:42.154 --> 31:44.373
Are you gonna be okay
getting home, young lady?

31:44.532 --> 31:47.081
Yeah, sure.

32:16.355 --> 32:18.357
Noah.

32:27.616 --> 32:29.618
Noah.

32:33.497 --> 32:35.841
Has the choice been made?

32:39.378 --> 32:41.380
Noah.

32:50.556 --> 32:53.560
I know you're probably
scared right now.

32:55.519 --> 32:57.521
But you can do this.

32:58.981 --> 33:01.734
You're prepared for this.
You can do it, son.

33:01.901 --> 33:04.404
I'm not your son.

33:05.821 --> 33:08.415
And you have no idea
how I'm feeling right now.

33:13.245 --> 33:15.088
You're right.

33:15.247 --> 33:17.921
I wouldn't pretend to know
how you're feeling.

33:20.628 --> 33:22.881
But you knew
this day was coming.

33:24.215 --> 33:26.638
And there can be
no mistakes... none.

33:31.138 --> 33:35.109
Humble yourself
before the Lord, Noah.

33:35.267 --> 33:38.771
We are His servants.
We are here to do His will.

33:38.938 --> 33:42.112
We should not question
what is beyond our understanding.

33:43.692 --> 33:45.569
Put aside your weaknesses,

33:45.736 --> 33:48.285
and He will give you strength.

33:48.447 --> 33:50.791
Do not get close to them...

33:50.950 --> 33:52.952
to any of them, to her.

34:00.709 --> 34:01.881
Here.

34:05.714 --> 34:07.716
Who is it?

34:09.260 --> 34:11.638
The younger sister... Mary.

34:38.330 --> 34:39.922
- Was it delicious?
- It was delicious.

34:40.081 --> 34:41.958
Yeah, it was delicious.

34:42.126 --> 34:44.003
Oh, hi, honey.

34:44.168 --> 34:46.297
Look, I left a plate for you
in the oven.

34:46.463 --> 34:48.340
How was your day?
Did you have fun?

34:48.507 --> 34:51.260
Rebecca has a boyfriend.
Rebecca has a boyfriend.

34:51.427 --> 34:52.849
He's not my boyfriend.

34:53.012 --> 34:55.253
Well, I sure hope not.
You've only known him a few hours.

34:55.347 --> 34:57.020
- Where's Mary?
- She's upstairs.

34:57.182 --> 34:59.184
She hasn't been
feeling well all day.

35:00.853 --> 35:02.355
Oh, yeah, no problem.
Don't worry about it.

35:02.521 --> 35:05.400
You're welcome for that plate
I left for you in the oven.

35:07.026 --> 35:08.778
Oh, you think that's funny,
do you?

35:15.034 --> 35:17.207
Ooh, wow, you look like shit.

35:17.369 --> 35:20.088
Thanks. I feel like shit.

35:20.247 --> 35:22.124
How's your mouth?

35:22.291 --> 35:24.043
Eh, it's okay.

35:24.209 --> 35:26.052
How was your date with Romeo?

35:26.211 --> 35:29.590
Fine, until that weird
Mason guy found us

35:29.757 --> 35:31.475
and told him to go home.

35:31.634 --> 35:33.352
Guess where home is.

35:33.510 --> 35:35.228
He lives with Mason?

35:35.387 --> 35:36.889
Pastor Kingsman.

35:37.056 --> 35:38.558
What?

35:38.724 --> 35:41.227
Yeah, exactly.
It was weird.

35:41.393 --> 35:43.816
Nice but weird.

35:43.979 --> 35:47.108
Okay, why don't you start
with the nice?

35:47.274 --> 35:50.494
I don't think I can stomach
the weird just yet.

39:24.825 --> 39:27.294
You do know we have
two separate rooms now, right?

39:27.452 --> 39:30.001
Sorry. I was just so tired.

39:30.163 --> 39:31.585
I didn't feel like...

39:31.748 --> 39:33.796
Walking all the way
down the hall.

39:33.959 --> 39:35.461
Oh, you poor thing.

39:35.627 --> 39:38.005
All that flirting with that Noah guy
must have really taken a toll on you.

39:38.171 --> 39:40.720
Ha-ha.
You feeling better?

39:40.883 --> 39:43.056
Eh, a little bit.

39:43.218 --> 39:45.516
But I've got to get out of this house.
So come on, get up.

39:45.679 --> 39:47.647
Let's go into town,
check out the boys.

39:47.806 --> 39:49.604
I need a little fun.

39:53.604 --> 39:55.724
- What are you doing?
- No, no, it's good.

39:55.814 --> 39:58.613
Oh, no, that doesn't look
very good at all, actually.

39:58.775 --> 40:01.028
- Easy now. Easy.
- What's with all the cookies?

40:01.194 --> 40:02.821
Well, they are supposed to be
for the festival,

40:02.988 --> 40:04.410
if your dad doesn't ruin
them all.

40:04.573 --> 40:06.041
Hey, easy.
I'm trying my best.

40:06.199 --> 40:08.452
Honey, yuck.

40:08.619 --> 40:11.793
Don't give him
all of your mistakes.

40:11.955 --> 40:14.333
- No, no, this is not a mistake.
- He is gonna get sick.

40:14.499 --> 40:15.939
So are you sure
you're gonna make it?

40:16.001 --> 40:17.878
Yeah, I'm fine.
It just hurts to eat.

40:18.045 --> 40:20.389
- Okay, but I want to get out of here.
- I know.

40:20.547 --> 40:23.972
- A masterpiece.
- I'm watching you. That looks...

40:24.134 --> 40:26.762
I'm gonna go to the park
with Pastor Kingsman.

40:26.929 --> 40:28.852
That sounds like
a really good idea, honey.

40:29.014 --> 40:31.358
Yeah, a pastor needs to be
with his people.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.359
Oh, can me and Mary
go to town too?

40:33.518 --> 40:35.198
'Cause we want to walk around
a little bit.

40:35.228 --> 40:36.901
So nobody's gonna
help me out at all?

40:37.064 --> 40:39.112
- No.
- No.

40:39.274 --> 40:40.651
Fine.
Take your brother.

40:40.817 --> 40:42.865
And get him something
other than a cookie to eat.

40:43.028 --> 40:45.577
All right, come on then.
Let's go.

40:45.739 --> 40:48.333
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:48.492 --> 40:51.211
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Out of here. Out of here.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.389
All right, you girls,
make yourself useful.

41:06.551 --> 41:08.770
- Help people out.
- Okay, Dad.

41:08.929 --> 41:10.806
- Hello.
- Hello.

41:10.973 --> 41:12.566
- Hello, Pastor.
- How are you?

41:12.724 --> 41:14.726
- Nice to see you.
- Hello to you too.

41:14.893 --> 41:16.895
- Want to help her out?
- Hi.

41:27.072 --> 41:29.074
Hmm.

41:30.742 --> 41:33.996
Okay. Not bad.
He's kind of cute.

41:34.162 --> 41:36.335
10 seconds.

41:36.498 --> 41:38.751
It took you 10 seconds
to find your mark.

41:38.917 --> 41:40.635
It's a gift.

41:50.095 --> 41:51.972
Hi.

41:52.139 --> 41:54.938
What are you doing?

41:55.100 --> 41:57.694
Well, I'm Mary

41:57.853 --> 42:00.481
and this is my sister Rebecca.

42:02.357 --> 42:04.109
- Smooth.
- Shut up.

42:09.614 --> 42:11.616
So have you lived here long?

42:29.551 --> 42:31.428
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:31.595 --> 42:33.472
Why are we hiding?

42:33.638 --> 42:35.982
We're not hiding.

42:36.141 --> 42:38.439
Well, maybe a little bit.

42:38.602 --> 42:40.730
You want to get out of here?

42:40.896 --> 42:43.319
Actually, there's something
I'd like to show you.

42:44.691 --> 42:47.240
- Right now?
- Yeah. Is that cool?

42:49.321 --> 42:51.289
Yeah, sure.
Let me just go tell Mary.

42:51.448 --> 42:52.620
<i>Okay</i>

42:56.828 --> 42:58.671
What, is that
your kissing both?

42:58.830 --> 43:00.924
- No.
- He's really cute.

43:01.083 --> 43:03.177
Um, I think
he just asked me out.

43:03.335 --> 43:04.427
Nice.

43:04.586 --> 43:06.463
Can you cover for me?

43:06.630 --> 43:09.179
Well, I can,
but it's gonna cost you.

43:09.341 --> 43:12.766
All right, fine. At least one
of us is doing all right.

43:12.928 --> 43:14.930
All right, thanks.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.353
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:04.271 --> 44:06.319
Is it weird?

44:06.481 --> 44:08.358
Ls what weird?

44:08.525 --> 44:10.402
Moving away from it all,

44:10.569 --> 44:12.617
away from your home.

44:12.779 --> 44:15.032
My parents seem really happy.

44:15.198 --> 44:17.576
I think they were tired
of the city.

44:19.244 --> 44:21.417
What about you?

44:21.580 --> 44:24.003
Me? I'm fine, I guess.

44:24.166 --> 44:26.885
I mean, it's different,
but it's okay.

44:27.043 --> 44:29.466
Just okay, huh?

44:30.463 --> 44:32.340
So where are we going?

44:32.507 --> 44:35.181
- You'll see.
- Okay.

44:41.433 --> 44:43.276
So you brought me
all the way out here

44:43.435 --> 44:45.062
to show me an old rusty tower?

44:45.228 --> 44:48.949
This is so much more
than an old rusty tower.

44:49.107 --> 44:50.279
Really?

44:51.860 --> 44:54.238
Yeah, really.

44:54.404 --> 44:56.782
I want to show it to you,
but if you're scared...

44:56.948 --> 44:59.167
Oh, you think that rickety old ladder
that climbs, what,

44:59.326 --> 45:01.704
100 feet in the air
is too scary for me?

45:01.870 --> 45:03.918
Please.

45:08.043 --> 45:09.920
Come on.

45:10.086 --> 45:12.088
What, are you chicken?

45:15.675 --> 45:17.803
Come on.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.077
Oh, my God.

45:42.244 --> 45:44.246
This is beautiful.

45:45.330 --> 45:47.332
I told you.

45:48.541 --> 45:51.340
This is where I come when I want
to get away from everything.

45:53.129 --> 45:55.803
It's kind of special to me.

45:55.966 --> 45:58.014
Well, you weren't kidding.

45:58.176 --> 46:00.178
It's amazing.

46:01.429 --> 46:03.932
And you can see
everything from up here.

46:05.350 --> 46:07.773
Makes you feel like
there is a world beyond here.

46:09.229 --> 46:11.402
There is a world beyond here.

46:11.564 --> 46:13.737
You know what I mean.

46:26.037 --> 46:28.711
Thank you, Noah.

46:28.873 --> 46:30.750
For what?

46:30.917 --> 46:33.170
For taking me here.

46:33.336 --> 46:35.634
I can see
why it's so special to you.

46:36.673 --> 46:39.051
I'm just glad you like it.

46:47.934 --> 46:51.734
So are you gonna stay
here in town?

46:53.231 --> 46:55.108
What do you mean?
I live here.

46:55.275 --> 46:58.654
No, I know you live here,
but I just thought

46:58.820 --> 47:00.900
since your dad's retiring
and everything, maybe you...

47:00.905 --> 47:02.373
My dad?

47:02.532 --> 47:04.409
Pastor Kingsman.

47:04.576 --> 47:06.920
Kingsman's not my dad.

47:07.078 --> 47:08.955
He's not your dad?

47:09.122 --> 47:12.171
But you live with him.

47:12.334 --> 47:14.211
Sorry.
It's none of my business.

47:14.377 --> 47:16.379
No, it's fine.

47:19.883 --> 47:21.931
When I lost my family,

47:22.093 --> 47:24.721
Kingsman took me in.

47:26.348 --> 47:28.601
He's strict,
but he's a good guy.

47:32.145 --> 47:35.069
I get the feeling
he doesn't want us hanging out.

47:36.649 --> 47:38.526
Why would you say that?

47:38.693 --> 47:40.570
Well, that whole thing
with Mason

47:40.737 --> 47:42.614
was a little weird yesterday.

47:42.781 --> 47:45.409
And us hiding from him today...

47:45.575 --> 47:47.452
I just... I feel like
he doesn't like me.

47:47.619 --> 47:49.838
It's not that.

47:49.996 --> 47:52.294
He's just being protective.

47:52.457 --> 47:55.677
He's not so keen
on the whole dating thing.

47:55.835 --> 47:57.712
Oh.

47:57.879 --> 47:59.881
So this is a date?

48:01.257 --> 48:02.634
I... I...

48:02.801 --> 48:04.803
I'm just kidding.

48:24.739 --> 48:26.616
Who is that?

48:26.783 --> 48:28.376
What?

48:28.535 --> 48:30.208
There's a guy down there
watching us.

48:30.370 --> 48:31.542
Where?

48:35.708 --> 48:37.176
We should go.

48:37.335 --> 48:38.803
Why? Who is it?

48:38.962 --> 48:42.216
I don't know. We should just go.
We shouldn't be up here.

49:19.502 --> 49:21.880
Did you think
I wouldn't find out?

49:22.046 --> 49:25.346
You were gonna betray us... all of us.
I will not let that happen.

49:25.508 --> 49:27.069
So I just have to put up
with this shit?

49:27.177 --> 49:29.537
My God, Noah, you've seen it.
You know what it's capable of.

49:29.554 --> 49:31.101
Why can't we stop it?

49:31.264 --> 49:33.187
It is God's will.
We are His servants.

49:33.349 --> 49:34.817
We must do everything we can...

49:34.976 --> 49:36.774
You're a fucking liar.

49:36.936 --> 49:39.030
Stop being such a child!

49:40.607 --> 49:43.451
Yes, we've been lied to.
Yes, we've been told stories...

49:43.610 --> 49:46.033
stories of angels
that will come down from heaven

49:46.196 --> 49:48.699
and slay the demons and send
them to hell and protect us all.

49:48.865 --> 49:51.664
There are no angels!
There is only us.

49:53.620 --> 49:56.794
You know what needs to be done.
And I need to know you'll do it.

49:58.041 --> 50:00.214
There is no other way.

50:04.380 --> 50:07.099
I just wish there was something
I could do to save them.

50:07.258 --> 50:09.260
Do your part.

50:19.145 --> 50:20.647
Oh, goodness. Hello.

50:20.813 --> 50:22.690
Mom, I'm gonna head off, okay?

50:22.857 --> 50:24.825
Oh, you like that, don't you?

50:24.984 --> 50:27.783
All right, well, you can go play
with the other kids.

50:27.946 --> 50:29.823
- Okay, Mom.
- Don't go too far.

50:29.989 --> 50:32.492
Check in with us.

50:32.659 --> 50:34.502
Mmmmm.

50:34.661 --> 50:36.709
I think we should do this
in the backyard.

50:36.871 --> 50:38.748
Hello. How are you?

50:38.915 --> 50:40.838
We're neighbors.
It's so nice to meet you.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.173
- Hello.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

50:43.336 --> 50:45.338
Well, aren't you handsome.

50:45.505 --> 50:48.224
- Hi.
- Hi there. Hi.

50:49.926 --> 50:52.679
Yeah, I got it. I got it.

50:52.845 --> 50:55.519
You did it. Awesome.

50:56.766 --> 50:58.359
Would you like some popcorn?

51:11.072 --> 51:13.200
Ooh!

51:13.366 --> 51:15.084
Was that you?

51:15.243 --> 51:17.371
Dad, you should try.
Come on.

51:17.537 --> 51:19.414
Let's get out of here.

51:27.463 --> 51:29.264
- Dad, please.
- You do it. Let him put you...

51:29.299 --> 51:30.801
- In the tank?
- Come on, come on, come on.

51:30.967 --> 51:32.310
- Oh, really?
- Come on, come on.

51:32.468 --> 51:34.468
- So do you see him anywhere?
- Who?

51:34.554 --> 51:36.682
Oh, don't even.
You know who. Noah.

51:36.848 --> 51:39.818
No, but he said he was coming,
so I'm not worried.

51:48.818 --> 51:50.491
So what do you guys think?

51:50.653 --> 51:52.826
Well, it's not totally lame.

51:52.989 --> 51:55.412
Yeah.

51:55.575 --> 51:59.170
Um, are there some cool games
or something?

51:59.329 --> 52:01.923
Yes, sure. Come on.

52:03.583 --> 52:05.256
All right,
let's see what you got.

52:05.418 --> 52:07.498
Nice. That was not even close.

52:07.545 --> 52:09.593
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

52:11.424 --> 52:13.472
Nice.

52:14.469 --> 52:16.221
Oh, you guys
really suck at this.

52:16.387 --> 52:18.560
Shut up, Noah.
You're taking all the fun out of it.

52:18.723 --> 52:19.770
I'm just saying.

52:19.932 --> 52:21.934
And aren't you the one that's
supposed to be winning us a prize?

52:22.101 --> 52:25.071
- Maybe he just can't throw a ball.
- Well, that's true.

52:27.315 --> 52:30.444
- Let me show you something.
- Oh, excuse me.

52:32.111 --> 52:33.784
- Oh.
- Holy shit.

52:33.946 --> 52:36.574
Maybe... maybe he can.
I don't know.

52:36.741 --> 52:38.288
Let's just take a seat.

52:38.451 --> 52:40.203
- I'm good. Thank you though.
- No? No?

52:40.370 --> 52:42.543
- I'm also good.
- Thanks.

52:42.705 --> 52:45.049
Cute.

52:58.262 --> 52:59.809
Let's see what you got, Mary.

52:59.972 --> 53:01.349
Oh, I'm not...
I can't follow that.

53:01.516 --> 53:03.644
I'm kind of thirsty. You guys want
to grab something to drink?

53:03.810 --> 53:06.188
Oh, that sounds good. I want one
of those pies I keep seeing around.

53:06.354 --> 53:08.448
- Of course you do.
- Shut up.

53:14.987 --> 53:17.240
Do you see them?
They look so happy.

53:17.407 --> 53:20.206
- They just fit right in here.
- I know. It's kind of perfect.

53:24.038 --> 53:25.415
Thank you.

53:25.581 --> 53:28.130
- So what can I get for you kids?
- Do you have pie here?

53:28.292 --> 53:29.492
- We sure do.
- Can I have one?

53:29.585 --> 53:31.087
What about you?
What would you like?

53:31.254 --> 53:32.881
You? Anything to drink?

53:36.592 --> 53:38.594
We'll have three
lemonades, please.

53:40.388 --> 53:42.265
All right, well,
I guess I'm having lemonade.

53:44.684 --> 53:46.561
Hey, are you okay?

53:46.728 --> 53:48.446
What? Yeah.

54:02.326 --> 54:03.418
Here you go.

54:03.578 --> 54:05.580
Thank you.

54:07.331 --> 54:09.379
- You guys want to go?
- Yeah.

54:23.890 --> 54:26.393
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

54:26.559 --> 54:28.937
Are you okay?
What happened?

54:29.103 --> 54:30.355
No, I'm fine.

54:30.521 --> 54:32.569
I'm good. I thought I was feeling
better, but I guess I'm not.

54:32.732 --> 54:34.109
- Thank you.
- You don't look good.

54:34.275 --> 54:35.822
No, no, I'm good.
I feel better. I threw up.

54:35.985 --> 54:38.488
- I'm gonna take you home.
- No, no, you guys are having...

54:38.654 --> 54:42.204
No, Becca, you guys are
having a good time.

54:42.366 --> 54:43.993
I feel fine.
Seriously, I'm gonna go...

54:44.160 --> 54:45.207
I'm gonna take you home.

54:45.369 --> 54:47.087
Becca, I'm gonna go
find Mom and Dad.

54:47.246 --> 54:49.499
- I'm good. I just want to...
- Are you sure?

54:49.665 --> 54:51.838
Yeah, I'm good.
You guys have fun.

56:40.401 --> 56:44.156
What? Why the fuck
are you doing this?

56:47.909 --> 56:50.287
I... I don't know
what you want,

56:50.453 --> 56:53.423
but please just...
just let me go. It's fine.

57:13.851 --> 57:16.229
What?

57:17.438 --> 57:19.486
What is this?
What are you doing?

57:21.067 --> 57:23.695
Shit. Oh, God.

57:26.906 --> 57:29.026
What is that? What the...
what the fuck are you doing?

57:32.078 --> 57:34.251
Please. Help!

57:34.413 --> 57:36.962
Please, God.

57:37.124 --> 57:38.922
Please help me.

57:54.558 --> 57:56.481
What are you doing?

57:58.229 --> 58:00.698
What the hell is this?

58:04.026 --> 58:05.778
Help!

58:05.945 --> 58:07.947
Please, God, help me!

58:15.121 --> 58:16.964
Please. Oh, God.

58:17.123 --> 58:19.467
Oh, God.

58:22.920 --> 58:25.139
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58:32.096 --> 58:35.316
Oh, my God.

58:48.154 --> 58:50.498
Please help.

58:50.656 --> 58:53.705
I don't know what this is,
but can you... can you...

58:53.868 --> 58:55.916
can you please just untie me?

58:57.288 --> 59:00.007
I didn't do anything.

59:01.667 --> 59:03.840
Oh, please.

59:04.003 --> 59:06.802
Please, I didn't do anything.

59:09.675 --> 59:11.598
Oh, please.

59:29.528 --> 59:32.031
With my blood,
the gate is open.

59:36.535 --> 59:38.503
This is Your servant, Lord.

59:38.662 --> 59:41.415
We commend her immortal soul
to Your everlasting care.

59:41.582 --> 59:43.175
What's happening?

59:43.334 --> 59:46.383
Her body may become
the vessel for His work.

59:46.545 --> 59:49.139
- In her death, may we have life.
- Please. Please.

59:49.298 --> 59:51.551
- In her suffering...
- Help!

59:51.717 --> 59:53.390
...may we have peace.

59:53.552 --> 59:56.021
Somebody please hear me!

59:56.180 --> 59:58.774
Amen.

59:58.933 --> 01:00:01.686
Come forth
and claim your offering.

01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:10.494
No. No.

01:00:10.653 --> 01:00:14.248
No. No. No!

01:00:56.448 --> 01:00:59.042
- Shh.
- Shush.

01:01:00.703 --> 01:01:03.502
Get your sweater.

01:01:07.835 --> 01:01:09.712
Let's go, honey.

01:01:09.879 --> 01:01:12.598
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:15.976
Jimmy, Jimmy, shh, shh, shh.

01:01:17.595 --> 01:01:19.643
Come on, let's go.
Come on, now.

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:21.682
No, now.

01:01:21.849 --> 01:01:23.817
- Hey, everybody, come on.
- Shh.

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:25.478
Dan.

01:01:28.397 --> 01:01:30.274
Dan, Wendy.

01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.318
Honey.

01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:34.657
- Mary, what's wrong?
- What happened?

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:36.242
What happened to you?

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:37.998
- She was sitting by herself.
- What?

01:01:38.157 --> 01:01:40.330
Sweetie, go get your sister.
We gotta go.

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:42.172
- Dan, we need to go.
- Becky!

01:01:42.244 --> 01:01:43.644
- Tell her...
- She'll be all right.

01:01:43.787 --> 01:01:45.505
Just get her home.
Get her to bed.

01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:47.166
- Honey.
- Honey, are you all right?

01:01:47.333 --> 01:01:49.677
Are you okay?

01:01:52.171 --> 01:01:54.424
I have to tell you something.

01:01:56.508 --> 01:01:58.351
What?

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.354
- Becca. Becky.
- What?

01:02:01.513 --> 01:02:04.687
I think Mary's sick.
Mom wants you.

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:06.693
What happened?

01:02:06.852 --> 01:02:09.025
I don't know.
She doesn't look good though.

01:02:09.188 --> 01:02:10.940
Come on, let's go.

01:02:11.106 --> 01:02:13.108
I understand. Go ahead.

01:02:16.237 --> 01:02:17.955
- Come on, you guys.
- What happened?

01:02:18.113 --> 01:02:19.581
- What happened?
- Honey.

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.458
She was supposed
to be with you.

01:02:21.617 --> 01:02:23.137
She's not feeling well. It's fine.

01:02:23.202 --> 01:02:25.375
She'll be all right.
She's just not feeling very well.

01:02:27.539 --> 01:02:30.133
All right, sweetie.
Let's just get her upstairs.

01:02:30.292 --> 01:02:32.340
Watch your brother.

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:34.847
Hey, let's watch TV.

01:02:42.346 --> 01:02:43.973
Hello.

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.016
Dad, it's for you.

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:48.060
Um, okay.

01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:51.197
Come on, sweets.
Almost there.

01:02:56.610 --> 01:02:59.238
Hello. Oh.

01:03:15.004 --> 01:03:17.803
Is there any way
we could do it tomorrow?

01:03:20.426 --> 01:03:22.303
Okay. Understood.

01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:23.971
<i>Okay</i>

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:27.224
Who was that?

01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:29.644
I have to go to the church.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:32.029
What, now? What for?

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:34.360
I don't know.

01:03:34.523 --> 01:03:36.901
Kingsman said
that he needed me.

01:03:38.027 --> 01:03:39.904
At this hour?
You can't go now.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:41.947
He knows your daughter's sick.

01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:43.957
Yeah, he said
that it was important.

01:03:44.116 --> 01:03:45.959
- Honey, I don't...
- How is she?

01:03:46.118 --> 01:03:47.620
She's not well.
She's sweating a lot.

01:03:47.786 --> 01:03:49.746
She doesn't have a fever.
I don't know what it is.

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.128
Okay.
It shouldn't be long, all right?

01:04:32.164 --> 01:04:34.166
Hello?

01:04:35.334 --> 01:04:37.211
Hello?

01:04:37.378 --> 01:04:39.551
Pastor Kingsman?

01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:03.946
Ahem.

01:05:04.113 --> 01:05:06.115
Pastor Kingsman.

01:05:07.866 --> 01:05:09.209
Are you okay?

01:05:09.368 --> 01:05:11.791
I had to get you away
from there.

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:15.049
It needs time.

01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:17.335
Not much, but it needs time.

01:05:20.295 --> 01:05:22.889
I'm afraid
that I'm not following.

01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:24.766
I don't know what needs time

01:05:24.925 --> 01:05:26.552
and what I'm supposed
to get away from.

01:05:26.718 --> 01:05:29.016
Yes, Dan, you are.
You are following.

01:05:29.179 --> 01:05:33.355
You are following His will.

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:40.657
You are a good man, Dan.
You are such a good man.

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:42.693
And I am so sorry.

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:46.114
I'm so sorry
that this has to happen

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.749
to your family, to you.

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:52.753
Oh, your poor daughter.
She is so young.

01:05:52.911 --> 01:05:55.039
What... what are you
talking about?

01:05:55.205 --> 01:05:58.505
God give us strength
to do what must be done.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:04.344
Have faith.
This is His will.

01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:10.930
Have faith.
Have faith, Dan.

01:06:53.263 --> 01:06:55.061
Mom, I'm gonna go
check on Mary.

01:06:55.224 --> 01:06:57.226
Yeah, good. Good.
Thank you.

01:07:06.652 --> 01:07:08.654
Mary.

01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:12.165
Mare.

01:07:13.158 --> 01:07:16.412
Mary. Mare.

01:07:18.080 --> 01:07:20.378
Mary! Mary!

01:07:20.541 --> 01:07:23.795
Mary. Mary.
Are you okay? Mary.

01:07:27.172 --> 01:07:29.675
Mom! Mom.

01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:36.853
- Mom.
- What happened?

01:07:37.015 --> 01:07:38.892
- I don't know.
- Mary, honey.

01:07:39.059 --> 01:07:41.061
Mary. Oh, my God.
You've got to help me.

01:07:41.228 --> 01:07:43.105
Christopher!
Sweetie, sweetie, get up.

01:07:43.272 --> 01:07:45.866
Christopher! Get up,
Mary, sweetie.

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:48.493
Christopher, call 911!

01:07:48.652 --> 01:07:50.199
- It's okay.
- Go!

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:52.706
It's okay.
Christopher, go!

01:07:54.408 --> 01:07:56.456
Come on, sweetie.

01:07:56.618 --> 01:07:59.041
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:07:59.204 --> 01:08:00.501
Whoa.

01:08:06.628 --> 01:08:08.972
Oh, my God. Mom.

01:08:09.131 --> 01:08:11.475
- Whoa.
- Mom, Mom.

01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:14.386
- Honey.
- Mom, what's happening?

01:08:14.553 --> 01:08:16.395
I don't know, baby.
I don't know. I don't know.

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:18.557
Christopher!

01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:22.064
Sweetheart.

01:08:25.856 --> 01:08:27.576
- Oh, my God.
- Get her to the bed.

01:08:27.608 --> 01:08:29.281
- Okay.
- Help me. Help me.

01:08:29.443 --> 01:08:31.537
Oh, Mary.

01:08:31.694 --> 01:08:34.493
Come on, baby.

01:08:36.825 --> 01:08:38.292
Christopher!

01:08:46.501 --> 01:08:48.502
Sweetie.

01:08:52.049 --> 01:08:53.470
- Morn.
- What?

01:08:53.634 --> 01:08:56.136
- The phones are all dead.
- What? What are you talking about?

01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:58.555
Mom.

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:02.100
I need you to go to the church
and get your father. Go get your father.

01:09:02.267 --> 01:09:03.769
- I want to go too.
- Okay, take your brother.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:06.609
- Okay, let's go.
- Go. Go. Hurry. Hurry.

01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:11.781
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:09:14.654 --> 01:09:16.122
Becca, wait up.

01:09:16.281 --> 01:09:18.124
Come on.

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:20.627
Becca.

01:09:23.162 --> 01:09:25.006
We've got to go.

01:09:25.165 --> 01:09:26.542
Come on, we need to get Dad.

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:28.676
I can't run as fast as you.
Just don't leave me.

01:09:28.835 --> 01:09:31.679
I would never leave you, okay?
We just... we gotta get Dad.

01:09:34.299 --> 01:09:35.767
What is that?

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:38.770
I don't know.
Come on, we gotta go.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.142
Come on.

01:10:05.831 --> 01:10:07.833
Over here.

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:20.061
Dad!

01:10:20.220 --> 01:10:21.642
Dad!

01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:23.523
Open! Dad!

01:10:23.682 --> 01:10:25.684
Dad, are you in there?

01:10:32.441 --> 01:10:34.694
What are you doing here?

01:10:35.944 --> 01:10:37.946
Move.

01:10:43.368 --> 01:10:45.211
Dad?

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:47.372
Wait here.

01:10:53.086 --> 01:10:55.214
Dad!

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.508
Oh, my God, Dad.

01:10:57.674 --> 01:10:59.893
Dad, are you okay?

01:11:00.051 --> 01:11:02.224
- Yeah.
- Dad.

01:11:02.387 --> 01:11:04.515
Noah.

01:11:05.515 --> 01:11:07.392
- Kingsman.
- Are you okay?

01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.561
What?

01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:13.732
- It was Kingsman.
- What?

01:11:14.941 --> 01:11:16.909
Where's your mother?

01:11:17.068 --> 01:11:19.947
She's... she's at home.
Mary's...

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:23.663
We have to go.
We have to go now.

01:11:23.825 --> 01:11:26.248
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:34.428
Look. What are those?

01:11:34.586 --> 01:11:36.304
They're on every house.

01:11:36.463 --> 01:11:38.932
Jesus. What...?

01:11:44.638 --> 01:11:46.640
We need to get home.

01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:54.986
Mary?

01:11:57.067 --> 01:11:58.284
Honey?

01:11:59.945 --> 01:12:02.539
Mary. Mary?

01:12:05.492 --> 01:12:06.539
Mary?

01:12:06.701 --> 01:12:08.203
Sweetie?

01:12:12.082 --> 01:12:13.880
Oh, my God.

01:12:15.961 --> 01:12:18.805
<i>Oh, my... Maw -</i>

01:12:36.314 --> 01:12:38.487
Get away.

01:13:08.847 --> 01:13:10.224
Dan.

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:14.520
Dan. Dan.

01:13:14.686 --> 01:13:16.688
Dan!

01:13:40.086 --> 01:13:42.714
Wait here.

01:13:47.218 --> 01:13:48.435
- Wait.
- What?

01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:50.876
- You can't go there. It's too late.
- What are you doing?

01:13:50.889 --> 01:13:53.187
Dad. Dad. Dad.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:54.943
You can't go in there, Rebecca.
Please trust me.

01:13:55.101 --> 01:13:56.728
- What are you doing, Noah?
- You're here for a reason.

01:13:56.895 --> 01:13:58.272
- Get off me!
- You have to go now.

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:01.487
- God damn it. Noah.
- It's too late. You can't save them.

01:14:01.650 --> 01:14:03.243
Let me go, Noah.

01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:04.903
It's too late.
You can't save them.

01:14:05.070 --> 01:14:07.198
- Please get in the car.
- Dad!

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:10.709
Rebecca, please get in the car.

01:14:30.178 --> 01:14:32.180
Hello?

01:14:52.784 --> 01:14:54.786
Wendy.

01:15:01.876 --> 01:15:03.253
Wendy.

01:15:04.254 --> 01:15:06.256
Honey.

01:15:07.298 --> 01:15:09.300
Honey.

01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:25.191
Wendy.

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:29.204
Wendy.

01:15:45.211 --> 01:15:47.213
Mary?

01:15:59.392 --> 01:16:01.611
Honey?

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.444
Mary-

01:16:23.124 --> 01:16:25.422
- Start the car! Go!
- Dad.

01:16:25.585 --> 01:16:27.462
- Dad.
- Start the car!

01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:30.132
- Dad, what's going on?
- Is that Mary?

01:16:35.178 --> 01:16:36.930
- Go! Get in the car!
- What?

01:16:37.097 --> 01:16:38.815
- Dad.
- Get them out of here. Get help.

01:16:38.973 --> 01:16:40.225
Get help. Go, go, go!

01:16:40.391 --> 01:16:42.314
- Get in the car!
- Daddy, you have to come.

01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:44.070
- Dan, get in the car.
- No. No.

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:46.323
Dad!

01:16:46.481 --> 01:16:48.483
Daddy!

01:16:48.650 --> 01:16:50.410
What are you doing?
We can't leave him there.

01:16:50.443 --> 01:16:52.741
We have to go. You have no idea
what that thing can do.

01:16:52.904 --> 01:16:54.406
Dad!

01:16:55.865 --> 01:16:59.586
Whatever this is,
please let it leave my daughter.

01:17:02.622 --> 01:17:05.421
In the name of Jesus Christ
our Holy Savior,

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.677
please be rid of my daughter.

01:17:09.879 --> 01:17:11.131
Leave my daughter!

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:22.142
Mary?

01:17:24.644 --> 01:17:26.271
Mary?

01:17:26.437 --> 01:17:28.735
Honey?

01:17:35.071 --> 01:17:36.243
Dad!

01:18:08.646 --> 01:18:11.820
Mary, no!

01:18:31.878 --> 01:18:34.097
Stop the car.

01:18:34.255 --> 01:18:36.303
We can't.

01:18:36.466 --> 01:18:38.719
Stop the car now.

01:18:38.885 --> 01:18:40.262
That's not your sister.

01:18:40.428 --> 01:18:43.102
Stop the fucking car now.

01:18:43.264 --> 01:18:45.892
Why are you stopping?

01:18:46.059 --> 01:18:48.687
Don't stop.
Keep going.

01:18:52.482 --> 01:18:54.200
Rebecca.

01:18:54.359 --> 01:18:56.361
Listen to me.
She's not your sister anymore.

01:18:56.527 --> 01:18:58.029
What the hell does that mean?

01:18:58.196 --> 01:18:59.876
What does that mean, Noah?
What's going on?

01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:02.121
Get in the car.

01:19:07.664 --> 01:19:10.008
Get in the car.

01:19:10.166 --> 01:19:11.918
Please get back in the car.

01:19:12.085 --> 01:19:14.759
I'll tell you what I know, but you
have to get back in the car right now.

01:19:14.921 --> 01:19:16.798
What?
You're part of this?

01:19:16.965 --> 01:19:18.842
Oh, my God,
you're part of this?

01:19:19.008 --> 01:19:21.602
Rebecca, please
get in the fucking car!

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:23.763
You were chosen.

01:19:23.930 --> 01:19:25.523
Chosen?

01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:27.776
Yes. You, your whole family.

01:19:27.934 --> 01:19:29.311
You were chosen.
We all were.

01:19:29.477 --> 01:19:31.571
I don't understand.

01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:33.072
We aren't meant to.

01:19:33.231 --> 01:19:35.654
My whole family was brought here
just like yours.

01:19:35.817 --> 01:19:38.445
You come here and you think
it's fucking perfect,

01:19:38.611 --> 01:19:40.491
and then you're fucked...
you, your whole family.

01:19:40.530 --> 01:19:41.531
That's just what happens.

01:19:41.698 --> 01:19:43.291
If they even knew I was
telling you any of this...

01:19:43.449 --> 01:19:45.326
Who is they?
Pastor Kingsman?

01:19:45.493 --> 01:19:46.619
Kingsman is just the keeper.

01:19:46.786 --> 01:19:48.387
He is just doing
what he was asked to do.

01:19:48.496 --> 01:19:52.376
This place is a doorway,
and on the other side is evil.

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:54.260
We were picked to be a part
of this great, big plan

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:55.579
that we have no control over.

01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:57.390
All I know is that once
the doorway is open,

01:19:57.505 --> 01:20:00.008
we have one job,
and one job only... to shut it.

01:20:01.801 --> 01:20:03.849
I'm sorry.
I'm trying to save you.

01:20:04.012 --> 01:20:06.060
Please trust me.
You have to get back in the car

01:20:06.222 --> 01:20:08.350
and we have to go right now.

01:20:13.146 --> 01:20:15.148
Get in the car!

01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:25.325
- Christopher!
- Help!

01:20:26.451 --> 01:20:29.045
Help! Help!

01:20:29.203 --> 01:20:31.046
- Christopher, she's coming.
- Help!

01:20:31.205 --> 01:20:33.333
She's coming, Christopher!
What are you doing?

01:20:33.499 --> 01:20:35.251
Christopher!

01:20:36.252 --> 01:20:38.471
No! She's coming,
Christopher!

01:20:51.225 --> 01:20:54.320
Help! Help!
Let me in!

01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:56.823
Help! Help!

01:20:56.981 --> 01:20:59.075
Please.

01:20:59.233 --> 01:21:01.110
Help!

01:21:01.277 --> 01:21:03.279
Please let me in!

01:21:08.326 --> 01:21:10.328
Help!

01:21:17.168 --> 01:21:19.842
Help! Help, please!

01:21:20.004 --> 01:21:21.722
Please help!

01:22:09.595 --> 01:22:11.973
What are we gonna do?

01:22:13.307 --> 01:22:15.309
Just keep looking.

01:22:24.235 --> 01:22:25.828
Oh, God.

01:22:27.613 --> 01:22:29.615
There she... there she is!

01:22:33.744 --> 01:22:35.246
Christopher is inside.

01:22:35.413 --> 01:22:37.461
Oh, my God.

01:22:37.623 --> 01:22:40.297
Is he gonna be safe in there?

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.760
I'm sorry,
but you can't stay here.

01:22:43.921 --> 01:22:45.923
Please.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:51.137
Why?

01:22:51.304 --> 01:22:52.977
Why won't you help me?

01:22:59.854 --> 01:23:01.697
Why won't you help me?

01:23:04.567 --> 01:23:06.786
I'm sorry,
but you have to leave.

01:23:06.944 --> 01:23:09.413
- Please. No. No!
- I'm sorry, but you have to leave.

01:23:09.572 --> 01:23:12.997
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Please. Please.

01:23:13.159 --> 01:23:15.628
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Please no!

01:23:15.786 --> 01:23:18.005
No. Please.

01:23:18.164 --> 01:23:20.713
Please, no, don't do this!

01:23:20.875 --> 01:23:23.128
- I'm sorry.
- You can't put me out there!

01:24:04.168 --> 01:24:06.011
Christopher.

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:08.389
Chris, I'm sorry.
Come on.

01:24:08.548 --> 01:24:11.017
Come on, get in the car.

01:24:20.685 --> 01:24:22.608
Come on, come on.

01:24:22.770 --> 01:24:24.613
Hurry. Okay.

01:24:24.772 --> 01:24:26.820
Go. She's coming! Go!

01:24:46.043 --> 01:24:48.296
It's okay. It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

01:24:48.462 --> 01:24:50.760
You're safe now.
You're safe.

01:24:51.799 --> 01:24:54.018
Where the hell are you going?

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:56.053
We have to stop the bleeding.

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:59.349
Oh, God.
It's okay, Chris. It's okay.

01:24:59.515 --> 01:25:01.392
It's okay.

01:25:05.062 --> 01:25:07.156
- Leave the car running.
- What?

01:25:07.315 --> 01:25:09.075
If it comes, you have to
promise me to leave.

01:25:09.233 --> 01:25:11.201
- Rebecca.
- But, Noah...

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.159
- Rebecca.
- Please promise.

01:25:14.322 --> 01:25:16.495
Noah, I promise.
Please just don't leave me.

01:25:24.999 --> 01:25:27.718
It's okay.
You're gonna be all right.

01:25:31.339 --> 01:25:33.091
It's okay.

01:25:34.091 --> 01:25:36.469
Okay. It's okay.

01:25:49.023 --> 01:25:50.195
It's okay.

01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:54.199
It's okay.

01:26:15.508 --> 01:26:17.510
- Shit.
- What's happening?

01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:22.974
No, no.

01:26:25.226 --> 01:26:26.603
No. No.

01:26:26.769 --> 01:26:29.147
Christopher! No.

01:26:30.231 --> 01:26:32.233
No! No.
Christopher, get away!

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:35.244
- Rebecca! Rebecca!
- Christopher!

01:26:35.403 --> 01:26:37.576
- No, Noah! No!
- Come on!

01:26:37.738 --> 01:26:40.116
Christopher! Christopher!

01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:42.831
- Christopher!
- No!

01:26:42.993 --> 01:26:44.586
No! Becca!

01:26:48.874 --> 01:26:51.593
No!

01:26:51.752 --> 01:26:54.631
No!
Christopher!

01:26:56.173 --> 01:26:58.892
No! Christopher!

01:26:59.051 --> 01:27:01.099
Stop it!
Get off of him!

01:27:11.355 --> 01:27:13.198
Christopher!

01:27:23.534 --> 01:27:25.878
No!

01:27:31.584 --> 01:27:33.882
Christopher!

01:27:37.214 --> 01:27:38.887
No.

01:28:35.898 --> 01:28:38.367
I have to keep you safe.

01:28:38.526 --> 01:28:40.824
I know a place. It's safe.
We can hide there till morning.

01:28:40.986 --> 01:28:43.284
Where?

01:28:49.245 --> 01:28:51.247
In here.

01:29:17.314 --> 01:29:19.988
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:29:21.443 --> 01:29:25.118
- Why are you doing this?
- I'm sorry.

01:29:25.281 --> 01:29:28.251
He's doing what God
has asked us to do.

01:29:28.409 --> 01:29:31.208
We must close the gate
and end this,

01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:34.499
or else darkness
will subdue the light

01:29:34.665 --> 01:29:37.088
and the world will become his.

01:29:39.753 --> 01:29:41.630
It's the way it's always been.

01:29:41.797 --> 01:29:43.970
There is no other way.

01:29:44.133 --> 01:29:47.387
We must close the gate.
