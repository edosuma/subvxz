WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.512
Previously on S.W.A.T.

00:01.513 --> 00:03.028
What do you trying to do with that boy?

00:03.053 --> 00:04.587
Try to find him a good foster situation.

00:04.621 --> 00:05.888
You think you could help me

00:05.922 --> 00:08.189
- look after him until then?
- You know I will.

00:08.224 --> 00:10.630
I'm thinking about doing
that good neighbor house program.

00:10.655 --> 00:12.389
The HUD advisory board's looking for

00:12.423 --> 00:14.089
the best officer candidate to move in.

00:14.123 --> 00:15.289
You live around here?

00:15.323 --> 00:16.976
- What's your name?
- Timo.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.443
- Hear you want to talk.
- I figure we could

00:18.477 --> 00:20.845
- set some ground rules.
- What you even doing here?

00:20.880 --> 00:22.680
Huh? No place left to gentrify?

00:22.715 --> 00:24.482
We're not looking to hassle
anybody on our off time.

00:24.516 --> 00:26.017
This is our neighborhood.

00:26.051 --> 00:27.986
We belong here. You don't.

00:28.020 --> 00:29.520
I'm turning in my 30-day notice.

00:29.555 --> 00:31.356
So pick another team leader,

00:31.390 --> 00:35.059
whether it's Deacon or Rocker, whoever.

00:35.094 --> 00:36.661
Captain just told us
that you pulled yourself

00:36.695 --> 00:38.296
from the running to be the new 50-David.

00:38.330 --> 00:40.298
With the pay bump, you wouldn't
need to moonlight anymore.

00:40.332 --> 00:43.401
I'm in a financial hole. Deep.
I stole some money today.

00:43.435 --> 00:45.837
It was in my pocket
before I threw it back

00:45.871 --> 00:47.472
and watched it burn.
But for a moment, I became

00:47.506 --> 00:49.407
someone not worthy
of leading a SWAT team.

00:49.441 --> 00:51.042
- What's this?
- That's the end of the story

00:51.076 --> 00:52.243
between you and Sergeant Kay.

00:52.278 --> 00:54.163
You're out of Deacon's life now.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.884
The reason we call it the Rook?

00:59.919 --> 01:01.486
Means checkmate.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.254
This is a 13,000-pound
critical incident vehicle

01:04.290 --> 01:05.857
equipped with gun port holes,

01:05.891 --> 01:08.326
enclosed cab with bulletproof glass,

01:08.360 --> 01:09.928
and an armored multiuse platform

01:09.962 --> 01:12.330
that can lift an entire
sniper team up to a rooftop.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.766
You're welcome to climb
aboard if you like.

01:15.184 --> 01:16.701
Hey, uh, Richie.

01:16.735 --> 01:18.569
When they're done, uh, will you
walk them back to Eagle's Nest?

01:18.604 --> 01:20.238
I'll meet you there later.

01:20.272 --> 01:21.839
Missed a hell of a takedown, Deac.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.708
Bad guys hit a massage parlor
over by LAX.

01:23.742 --> 01:26.277
Yeah, the kind with
special services. Cash only.

01:26.312 --> 01:28.413
Bozos took the customers
and the girls hostage, man.

01:28.447 --> 01:31.182
So we gave them a happy ending.
Sent them all off to jail.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.518
- The best way to end a work shift.
- Hey.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.687
- How's the tour business going?
- Uh, not bad.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.855
But, uh, today will be my last one.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.583
As long as you sign off on this.

01:40.993 --> 01:43.086
You're being reinstated,
full-duty. Congratulations, man.

01:43.121 --> 01:44.600
Aw, come on, don't act so surprised.

01:44.634 --> 01:46.264
Somebody had to talk the
captain into letting me

01:46.298 --> 01:47.865
take my PFQ earlier than the ten weeks,

01:47.900 --> 01:49.267
and I'm, uh, guessing it was you.

01:49.301 --> 01:50.935
Deac, I had nothing to do with that.

01:50.970 --> 01:53.071
I mean, I might have put in my two cents,

01:53.105 --> 01:54.305
you know, said a little
something-something.

01:54.340 --> 01:55.873
Thanks.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.443
It's gonna be really good
to have you back, man.

01:58.477 --> 02:00.645
- So you talked to him?
- Yeah.

02:00.679 --> 02:02.613
What'd he say? He doesn't want a party.

02:02.648 --> 02:04.615
What? Who are you talking about?

02:04.650 --> 02:06.250
Mumford doesn't want a party.

02:06.285 --> 02:07.919
Too bad. It's tradition.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.620
Besides, it's been years
since a true old-timer

02:09.655 --> 02:11.255
has retired from SWAT.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.423
Mumford's getting a send-off shindig

02:12.458 --> 02:13.758
whether he wants one or not.

02:13.792 --> 02:17.116
Tributes, testimonials,
the whole thing. That's an order.

02:17.151 --> 02:18.429
Sounds like you're
gonna be trying to pull

02:18.464 --> 02:20.431
at some heartstrings, see if
you can get Mumford to crack.

02:20.466 --> 02:22.166
Well, I might have been
working on a little something.

02:22.201 --> 02:23.418
Shh.

02:25.170 --> 02:26.771
Nobody's gonna make me crack.

02:26.805 --> 02:28.072
I'm walking out of here

02:28.107 --> 02:30.308
with a smile on my face and no tears.

02:30.342 --> 02:31.843
And don't even think about a party.

02:31.877 --> 02:33.371
We got to do something.

02:33.405 --> 02:34.779
You might be the next 50-David,

02:34.813 --> 02:36.681
but I'm still your boss.

02:36.715 --> 02:37.949
Seriously, I don't want anybody

02:37.983 --> 02:39.450
making a big deal out of this.

02:39.485 --> 02:41.568
I want to clean out my locker and leave.

02:41.602 --> 02:44.989
No hugs, no sappy speeches
with everybody blubbering.

02:45.024 --> 02:46.524
And no presents.

02:46.558 --> 02:47.792
Because there's no way

02:47.826 --> 02:49.193
you can get me a better

02:49.228 --> 02:51.262
retirement present than I got for myself.

02:55.494 --> 02:56.794
Shelby, sit.

02:57.236 --> 02:58.636
Good girl.

02:58.670 --> 02:59.771
Now, circle.

02:59.805 --> 03:01.039
Shelby, you can do it.

03:01.073 --> 03:02.840
Circle. Good girl.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.575
Want a treat?

03:07.099 --> 03:08.711
Hey, it's not my fault.

03:08.745 --> 03:10.090
You're the one that ate 'em all.

03:11.083 --> 03:13.384
Fine. I'll go get some more.

03:15.000 --> 03:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:44.950 --> 03:46.484
Immigration Customs Enforcement.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.919
We need you to come with us.

03:47.953 --> 03:49.887
ICE? I haven't done nothing wrong.

03:49.922 --> 03:51.522
- Please. Please, ma'am.
- Show me a warrant!

03:51.557 --> 03:52.561
In the car now.

03:52.586 --> 03:54.091
No. I'm not gonna go anywhere with you.

03:54.126 --> 03:56.027
Get in the car.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.000
Hey, kid! Come over here!

04:03.035 --> 04:04.602
I need to talk to you!

04:28.660 --> 04:30.428
Thank you, Ms. McDonald.

04:30.462 --> 04:32.430
Okay. Talk to you tomorrow.

04:35.434 --> 04:36.868
I thought you had a meeting.

04:36.902 --> 04:38.402
The usher board at church

04:38.437 --> 04:39.737
can do fine without me.

04:39.771 --> 04:43.183
Darryl needs an adult in this house.

04:43.976 --> 04:47.278
Mama, I know. I'm trying.
But I had to work late.

04:47.312 --> 04:49.313
I understand. But we agreed.

04:49.348 --> 04:51.382
I cover the homework,
and you cook a hot meal

04:51.416 --> 04:53.117
at least four times a week.

04:53.152 --> 04:54.785
You didn't need to cook and tutor Darryl.

04:54.820 --> 04:56.621
- I told him to get takeout.
- I know.

04:56.655 --> 04:59.190
I saw the leftovers
from last night's takeout.

05:08.667 --> 05:09.834
What's up, D?

05:09.868 --> 05:11.312
How was school today?

05:11.347 --> 05:12.537
Yo, let me show you something.

05:17.709 --> 05:20.478
A B-plus? Congrats, man.
I'm proud of you.

05:20.512 --> 05:22.613
- This is serious progress.
- Thank you.

05:22.648 --> 05:24.615
I had to show that teacher I can do it.

05:24.650 --> 05:26.584
She thinks, 'cause I was
in juvie, that I'm stupid.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.819
Darryl? What did I say about that word?

05:29.396 --> 05:31.422
No one's stupid, only uneducated.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.988
And what'd I tell you
when you got out of juvie?

05:33.023 --> 05:34.090
You can't run from your past.

05:34.115 --> 05:35.654
That's right. People are gonna judge,

05:35.689 --> 05:37.995
- which means you got to do what?
- Own it and do better.

05:38.030 --> 05:39.797
Admit you made mistakes,
but prove that you're not

05:39.831 --> 05:41.365
- about that life no more.
- There it is.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.667
You got this, man.

05:42.701 --> 05:45.369
Hondo. Somebody's trying to reach you.

05:46.838 --> 05:48.673
It's your caseworker.
She might have found you

05:48.707 --> 05:50.728
- a new foster family.
- For real?

05:50.763 --> 05:53.010
Does she know how old I am?
And about my past?

05:53.045 --> 05:54.645
They might appreciate
a teenager that knows

05:54.680 --> 05:56.881
how to clean up after hisself.

05:58.350 --> 06:00.051
- When do I have to meet 'em?
- Tell you what,

06:00.085 --> 06:03.287
let me meet 'em first,
and then we'll go from there.

06:03.847 --> 06:06.516
- Really proud of you.
- Thanks.

06:07.726 --> 06:09.126
Street!

06:09.161 --> 06:11.128
Your high score's going down.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.811
Yeah. Too bad you talk
better than you play, buddy.

06:13.846 --> 06:16.200
Hey. Check out this picture
Kelly drew of Black Betty.

06:16.235 --> 06:17.468
Dude! Her mom says that she's about

06:17.502 --> 06:19.337
to start a new charter school this year.

06:19.371 --> 06:20.504
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

06:20.539 --> 06:21.973
Hey, uh, you been still helping her

06:22.007 --> 06:23.207
with the reading, the dyslexia?

06:23.242 --> 06:24.208
Couple times a week.

06:24.243 --> 06:25.209
Yeah.

06:25.244 --> 06:26.410
Hey, you want to get that?

06:26.445 --> 06:27.478
And blow my game? Nice try.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.646
One minute.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.047
- You know what? Ah...
- Dude! Dude!

06:30.082 --> 06:32.149
I have multi-balls.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.417
Hey, Vera, what's up?

06:33.452 --> 06:35.019
Luca, did Timo sneak over here

06:35.053 --> 06:37.521
- to play pinball again?
- Nope, I haven't seen him.

06:37.556 --> 06:38.889
His bike's gone. I can't find him.

06:38.924 --> 06:40.307
I mean, he was out front
like an hour ago,

06:40.341 --> 06:41.620
just doing tricks with Shelby.

06:41.654 --> 06:43.214
He knows he's not supposed
to be out without

06:43.249 --> 06:45.029
- telling me where he's going.
- Maybe he just rode over

06:45.063 --> 06:46.597
to a friend's house,
got lost in a video game.

06:46.632 --> 06:48.099
He always leaves me a note.

06:48.133 --> 06:50.167
- Something's not right.
- Okay. Okay.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.864
- Come on.
- We're gonna help you find him, okay?

06:51.898 --> 06:53.771
Come on. Let's go.

06:53.805 --> 06:56.096
- Timo!
- Timo!

06:56.130 --> 06:57.441
Timo!

06:57.476 --> 07:00.609
Yo. Cashier says Timo
bought some dog treats

07:00.644 --> 07:01.879
- about 30 minutes ago.
- Okay, that's good.

07:01.913 --> 07:03.381
That means we're on the right path.

07:03.415 --> 07:04.882
And if he's trying to avoid traffic,

07:04.916 --> 07:07.385
fastest way home from here
would be that way.

07:07.869 --> 07:09.587
- Timo!
- Timo!

07:10.038 --> 07:11.289
Timo!

07:11.323 --> 07:13.529
When I was a kid, I used to
blow curfew all the time.

07:13.564 --> 07:15.593
Drove my foster parents nuts.

07:15.627 --> 07:17.595
- I always came home, you know?
- Timo!

07:18.964 --> 07:21.675
- Timo!
- Timo!

07:22.634 --> 07:24.068
Timo!

07:24.102 --> 07:25.303
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.

07:25.337 --> 07:26.604
Whoa, hang on a sec.

07:29.432 --> 07:30.581
Oh, no.

07:30.622 --> 07:31.681
That's Timo's bike.

07:31.715 --> 07:32.777
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:32.811 --> 07:34.043
- Timo!
- Hang on, hang on, hang on!

07:34.078 --> 07:35.313
It's okay.

07:35.347 --> 07:36.814
Hey, hey, hey. It's all right.

07:36.848 --> 07:39.216
Listen, to me, listen to me.

07:39.251 --> 07:40.918
Hey, this is Officer Dominique Luca,

07:40.952 --> 07:43.621
22-David, LAPD SWAT.

07:43.655 --> 07:45.423
I want to report a missing child.

07:45.457 --> 07:53.458
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

08:19.611 --> 08:20.790
Thanks, Okay!

08:20.791 --> 08:23.645
Hey no hits in the morgue or the
hospitals, so that's good news, man.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.139
I spoke to Mrs. Colon. Usually
sees everything from her porch,

08:26.164 --> 08:27.331
but, uh, she's in her kitchen cooking.

08:27.365 --> 08:28.632
- Yeah.
- Did you check the...

08:28.666 --> 08:30.133
Yeah, the parking lot
where the skaters hang out.

08:30.168 --> 08:32.836
I got Patrol on it,
and Plummer Park a block over.

08:32.870 --> 08:34.136
Chris, thanks for coming to help out

08:34.172 --> 08:35.304
during your off hours, man.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.687
I hope we didn't screw up any plans.

08:36.722 --> 08:39.076
Nah, Ty and Kira are working
late, so no plans to spoil.

08:39.110 --> 08:41.078
I know you guys care about Timo, but...

08:41.111 --> 08:42.546
doesn't look like Patrol's
having much luck

08:42.580 --> 08:43.914
getting people to open doors
and answer questions.

08:43.948 --> 08:45.382
No surprise there.

08:45.416 --> 08:47.078
I mean, we've built some trust
with folks in the neighborhood

08:47.119 --> 08:48.747
past few months, but
still a long way to go.

08:48.781 --> 08:50.554
We're getting there.
I mean, they see me and Street

08:50.588 --> 08:52.489
every day... we come home,
take out the trash...

08:52.523 --> 08:53.991
I just hope it helps us find Timo.

08:54.729 --> 08:55.896
I got all the kid's particulars.

08:55.921 --> 08:57.055
Gonna get his photo out wide.

08:57.089 --> 08:58.389
Vera, you should go home

08:58.424 --> 08:59.924
in case Timo shows up there, right?

08:59.959 --> 09:01.345
Come on.

09:01.379 --> 09:02.579
- Is that Marcos?
- Yeah.

09:02.614 --> 09:05.229
Remember we had that beef
with him last year?

09:05.264 --> 09:07.398
Whoa! Whoa!

09:07.433 --> 09:09.033
Whoa! Hey, Marcos.

09:09.068 --> 09:10.243
You seen Timo around?

09:10.244 --> 09:11.678
You looking to bust little kids now?

09:11.712 --> 09:12.846
Look, you didn't answer my question, man.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.681
Too distracted by the cop convention.

09:14.715 --> 09:15.822
Look, have you seen him or not?

09:15.857 --> 09:17.350
Look, I don't have time
to play "Ask a Mexican."

09:17.385 --> 09:18.585
Y'all told us to stay away

09:18.619 --> 09:20.687
from that kid, right? That's what I did.

09:20.721 --> 09:22.789
Come on, man, your crew's on top
of everything on this stretch.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.257
You telling us you don't know anything?

09:24.292 --> 09:25.924
Yeah. That's what I'm saying.

09:27.561 --> 09:28.862
Everybody got problems.

09:29.515 --> 09:31.216
Timo ain't mine.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.714
What's with that guy?

09:48.154 --> 09:49.864
Timo has a dog, right?

09:50.685 --> 09:52.819
Uh, yeah. A beagle, I think.

09:52.853 --> 09:54.587
Named Shelby. Why?

09:54.894 --> 09:56.628
I've got an idea.

10:00.125 --> 10:02.128
You told me it takes months
to train a police dog.

10:02.163 --> 10:04.064
Beagles are natural trackers.

10:04.098 --> 10:06.433
And it helps that we're looking
for a smell she already knows.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.711
Plus, the treats we've been giving
her since we left the house

10:08.746 --> 10:11.504
teach her to associate Timo's scent
with reward.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.263
Hey, she's got something.

10:13.974 --> 10:16.349
Good girl, Shelby.

10:21.482 --> 10:22.982
This can't be right.

10:23.017 --> 10:24.951
This is where Timo's scent trail leads.

10:24.985 --> 10:26.586
Man, he wouldn't come here on his own.

10:26.620 --> 10:27.787
This place has been red-tagged

10:27.822 --> 10:29.823
for demolition for months now.

10:29.857 --> 10:31.389
Where is he, Shelby?

10:31.739 --> 10:33.159
Which way?

10:33.825 --> 10:35.462
Good girl. Come on.

10:36.831 --> 10:39.766
What you got?

10:39.800 --> 10:42.001
Yeah, I think we've reached the limits

10:42.036 --> 10:43.536
of Shelby's tracking skills.

10:43.571 --> 10:44.804
There's too many other scents.

10:44.839 --> 10:46.506
Hey, wait a minute. Whoa, whoa.

10:46.540 --> 10:47.774
These, uh, footprints.

10:47.808 --> 10:49.175
These things are recent.

10:49.210 --> 10:50.677
Timo, are you in here?

10:50.711 --> 10:51.978
- Timo!
- Timo!

10:52.012 --> 10:53.513
Luca?

10:53.547 --> 10:55.415
Hey, it's Luca and Street, bud.

10:57.184 --> 10:58.284
What are you doing in here, man?

10:58.319 --> 10:59.352
Your mom's worried sick about you.

10:59.387 --> 11:00.353
Why didn't you come home, bud?

11:00.388 --> 11:01.955
- I was hiding.
- Hiding from who?

11:01.989 --> 11:04.557
- The bad guys.
- Come on down.

11:04.592 --> 11:06.025
What's going on, man?

11:06.060 --> 11:07.627
Who are you hiding from, huh?

11:08.234 --> 11:09.629
- Look who it is.
- Shelby!

11:09.663 --> 11:11.965
Hi. Hi, Shelby.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.034
- Hey, so what bad guys?
- The ones in black.

11:14.068 --> 11:17.341
They had guns. I saw them take Sosie.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.788
They tried to get me, but I ran.

11:19.823 --> 11:21.207
All right, well, you're okay now.

11:21.242 --> 11:22.876
There's no bad guys here now, see?

11:22.910 --> 11:24.624
Come on, let's get you home to your mom.

11:24.659 --> 11:25.845
Come on.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.014
- Let's go. Come on.
- Let's go, Shelby.

11:28.705 --> 11:29.782
Good girl.

11:29.807 --> 11:31.441
Who's Sosie?

11:31.466 --> 11:34.254
Sosie, she, uh, she lives
on my block, with her mom.

11:34.288 --> 11:36.823
You think there's any truth
to what Timo said?

11:37.222 --> 11:38.921
What? Bad guys in black with guns?

11:38.955 --> 11:40.892
- Yeah.
- Could be Marcos' crew.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.063
- Mijo. Mijo.
- Mom.

11:44.098 --> 11:46.132
Thank God.

11:48.302 --> 11:50.069
I was so scared.

11:50.104 --> 11:52.038
Please, don't ever do that to me again.

11:55.657 --> 11:57.177
- Hi.
- Yes?

11:57.211 --> 11:58.983
Mrs. Galvez, I'm Officer Jim Street.

11:59.017 --> 12:00.680
I actually live just down the block.

12:01.079 --> 12:03.335
Is your daughter Sosie...
is she-she home?

12:03.336 --> 12:06.086
Uh, no. S-Sosie's out with some friends.

12:06.111 --> 12:07.345
Are you sure about that?

12:07.370 --> 12:10.588
Yes, I-I just talked to her
a little while ago.

12:12.259 --> 12:13.426
Would it be okay if we call her?

12:13.461 --> 12:14.794
We just want to make sure she's okay.

12:14.829 --> 12:17.430
No need. Uh, Sosie is fine.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.291
Hi.

12:21.326 --> 12:22.602
Hey, I'm Jim. I, uh...

12:22.636 --> 12:24.871
I'm your neighbor.
I don't think we've met yet.

12:24.905 --> 12:25.939
Th-That is

12:25.973 --> 12:27.440
Sosie's cousin Pedro.

12:30.164 --> 12:31.230
Hey, Pedro, do you mind

12:31.264 --> 12:32.879
stepping out here for a moment?

12:33.286 --> 12:34.687
Come on out.

12:39.019 --> 12:41.221
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- No problem.

12:41.255 --> 12:42.889
I mean, we'd just like to see some I.D.,

12:42.923 --> 12:44.205
if that's okay.

12:44.959 --> 12:46.226
Sorry.

12:46.260 --> 12:47.527
Don't have my wallet on me.

12:49.752 --> 12:51.441
Hey. I need you to put your hands up.

12:51.482 --> 12:52.862
Okay? Let's just put your hands up,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.048
- nice and slow.
- Turn around.

12:54.082 --> 12:55.090
- Turn around.
- Turn around, face...

12:56.102 --> 12:57.269
Rabbit!

13:04.863 --> 13:06.064
Gun!

13:10.961 --> 13:12.752
Darryl's been doing
really great in school.

13:12.786 --> 13:14.020
He's got a good attitude.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.761
He just needs a solid family situation

13:15.795 --> 13:17.127
to keep him on track.

13:17.161 --> 13:18.258
The caseworker said Darryl's

13:18.292 --> 13:20.021
staying with you in the meantime.

13:20.055 --> 13:22.662
He has been. It's just,
with my work schedule, I...

13:23.119 --> 13:24.425
I can't keep him permanently.

13:24.459 --> 13:26.432
Capri, she's a stay-at-home mom,

13:26.467 --> 13:29.469
so there's always a parent around here.

13:30.168 --> 13:31.875
These your foster kids?

13:31.909 --> 13:33.507
It's quite a family you got here.

13:33.541 --> 13:35.008
Oh, yeah.

13:35.548 --> 13:37.412
Only the younger three at home.

13:37.446 --> 13:39.946
The older two have already
grown up and moved on.

13:39.980 --> 13:41.447
- Where'd they end up?
- One's in Riverside.

13:41.482 --> 13:46.252
The other's, uh... Long Beach now.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.055
You don't stay in touch?

13:50.605 --> 13:51.958
You know how they are.

13:51.992 --> 13:55.161
When they get older, they hit 18,

13:55.195 --> 13:57.530
get social lives, do their own thing.

13:57.565 --> 13:59.347
It's hard to keep up with them sometimes.

14:00.427 --> 14:01.734
You boys finish the laundry?

14:01.769 --> 14:03.670
Yes, sir. We folded everything.

14:03.704 --> 14:05.305
All right. Put your clothes away,

14:05.339 --> 14:06.558
then get going on your homework.

14:06.592 --> 14:07.872
Yes, sir.

14:11.209 --> 14:13.313
We believe kids benefit from a routine.

14:13.347 --> 14:15.548
Free time is a reward.

14:15.583 --> 14:16.849
You give a child structure,

14:16.884 --> 14:18.885
it's amazing how they respond.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.177
We'll instill that in Darryl.

14:25.359 --> 14:26.926
Thank you for the information.

14:27.558 --> 14:29.162
This is what you do when you're off-duty?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.598
We were trying to locate
a missing neighborhood kid,

14:31.632 --> 14:33.666
and when we did, it led us here.

14:33.701 --> 14:35.835
And then there was an
officer-involved shooting.

14:35.869 --> 14:38.038
Have any idea why the suspect
became aggressive?

14:38.073 --> 14:39.393
Sosie Galvez.

14:39.427 --> 14:41.608
Earlier today, kid witness saw her

14:41.642 --> 14:43.109
get grabbed up by a couple guys

14:43.143 --> 14:45.111
in a dark sedan
about three blocks that way.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.013
Yeah, about the same time our dead guy,

14:47.047 --> 14:49.048
armed with a gun,
forced his way into the house,

14:49.083 --> 14:51.584
telling Sosie's mom that he's
gonna sit with her for a while.

14:51.619 --> 14:52.919
Yeah. We're thinking whoever took Sosie

14:52.953 --> 14:54.520
must want something from her.

14:54.555 --> 14:56.556
So they use a threat against
the mom as leverage.

14:56.590 --> 14:57.857
Yeah, that's the best we could figure.

14:57.891 --> 14:59.759
- Any I.D.?
- Uh, no, but we did have

14:59.793 --> 15:01.373
a cell phone. It's locked, though.

15:01.408 --> 15:03.725
I'll tell Hollywood Division we'll
help them search for Sosie.

15:03.759 --> 15:05.150
We'll get the cell phone over to Tech.

15:05.185 --> 15:06.699
- Okay.
- Hey, uh,

15:06.734 --> 15:08.434
the mom was having some
trouble breathing.

15:08.469 --> 15:10.370
I thought it'd be good
to get her checked out.

15:10.404 --> 15:12.472
- Is she all right?
- They say she just got

15:12.506 --> 15:14.889
a little excited and she
started hyperventilating.

15:14.924 --> 15:16.476
She's terrified for her daughter.

15:16.510 --> 15:18.913
She has no idea what this
is about, or where they might

15:18.947 --> 15:21.247
- have taken Sosie?
- No, she's as clueless as we are.

15:21.281 --> 15:23.483
- Ma'am, it's a crime scene! Ma'am, stop!
- No! Ama! Ama!

15:23.517 --> 15:25.918
It's okay. Sosie. No, no, no.
It's okay, it's okay.

15:25.953 --> 15:27.487
It's not your mom, it's not your mom.

15:27.521 --> 15:29.055
No, no. She's okay, she's over here.

15:29.089 --> 15:30.456
- That's the missing girl?
- Yeah, that's Sosie.

15:30.491 --> 15:32.723
- Ama.
- Sosie, Sosie.

15:37.352 --> 15:38.552
Sosie?

15:38.577 --> 15:39.828
Captain Cortez.

16:13.033 --> 16:14.701
- Sí.
- Whoever grabbed Sosie

16:14.735 --> 16:17.036
got everything they need to rob
the family she works for.

16:17.071 --> 16:18.838
- Okay, we got to get over there, then.
- I'll send a patrol unit

16:18.872 --> 16:20.440
for surveillance and roll Mumford's team.

16:20.474 --> 16:22.175
But, Captain, I-I know
we're off the clock now,

16:22.209 --> 16:23.901
but-but Sosie and her mom,

16:23.935 --> 16:25.214
they're our neighbors, all right?

16:25.248 --> 16:26.879
I want to get these guys. Street?

16:26.914 --> 16:28.448
Yeah, yeah. Hell yeah. I'm in.

16:28.482 --> 16:30.717
All right. Meet Mumford there.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.121
I'll get the address from Sosie,
and then I'll text you guys.

16:35.155 --> 16:36.562
- Okay. Thanks.
- All right? Bye.

16:39.159 --> 16:41.627
Uni on scene reports seeing
a body through the windows.

16:41.662 --> 16:43.362
Possible gunshot wound.

16:43.397 --> 16:45.531
Luca and Street are meeting us
there, per Captain Cortez.

16:45.566 --> 16:47.033
Okay, let's get squared away,

16:47.067 --> 16:48.668
make sure we do this thing right.

16:48.702 --> 16:50.536
It's my last shift. I don't want
any of you knuckleheads

16:50.571 --> 16:51.953
screwing it up.

17:02.683 --> 17:06.551
What's this, one last chance
to bathe in my glory? Let's go.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.362
Luca, up.

17:26.140 --> 17:29.509
Three, two, one.

17:34.548 --> 17:35.715
Go.

17:37.440 --> 17:39.285
- Two, two, two.
- Two.

17:39.319 --> 17:40.520
Go.

17:40.554 --> 17:42.021
Street out!

17:42.055 --> 17:44.023
50-David, I need an R/A at my location.

17:44.057 --> 17:46.292
- How many are there?
- Two.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.895
They dragged my husband
and daughter into the hallway.

17:53.634 --> 17:55.768
LAPD SWAT! Come out with your hands up!

17:55.803 --> 17:57.226
Come out right now!

18:00.340 --> 18:01.841
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

18:04.275 --> 18:05.711
Hey, it's okay.

18:05.746 --> 18:09.382
We're the police. You can come out now.

18:09.416 --> 18:11.782
We just need you to put the gun down.

18:15.189 --> 18:18.191
No more shooting, understand?

18:22.162 --> 18:24.330
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

18:24.364 --> 18:27.733
Hey, it's all over now.

18:28.049 --> 18:29.302
We're here to help you.

18:29.675 --> 18:31.304
My dad.

18:31.338 --> 18:33.372
They killed my dad.

18:34.441 --> 18:36.242
And they'll pay for that.

18:36.276 --> 18:37.810
Okay?

18:37.845 --> 18:39.679
But right now,
I just need you to drop the gun.

18:39.713 --> 18:42.281
Just drop the gun and come to me, okay?

18:42.315 --> 18:45.117
That's it. That's it. Come to me.

18:45.566 --> 18:46.652
Come to me.

18:46.687 --> 18:48.087
It's okay.

18:48.121 --> 18:50.189
Come to me. Come on.

18:50.224 --> 18:53.025
That's it. Come on. That's it. That's it.

18:53.060 --> 18:55.743
Okay. It's okay. Come on.

18:58.746 --> 19:00.254
Heard about what happened last night.

19:00.279 --> 19:02.480
Figured I'd come in a little
early, see if I can help out.

19:02.514 --> 19:04.774
This is the fifth home invasion
robbery linked to this crew.

19:05.609 --> 19:07.085
But the first time that
they've killed someone.

19:07.110 --> 19:09.711
Brentwood, Pacific Palisades,
two in Hancock Park,

19:09.746 --> 19:11.547
and last night,
the Steinburgs in Cheviot Hills.

19:11.581 --> 19:12.948
Those are dream neighborhoods.

19:12.982 --> 19:14.416
Average home price in those areas

19:14.451 --> 19:15.884
has to be north of five million.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.920
In each case, they knew
the alarm and gate codes,

19:17.954 --> 19:19.588
they knew the location of the home safe,

19:19.622 --> 19:21.223
but we couldn't figure out
how they were getting

19:21.257 --> 19:22.784
the information until now.

19:22.818 --> 19:23.959
They target the housekeepers.

19:23.993 --> 19:25.728
They force them to give up the info.

19:25.763 --> 19:27.763
And given that a lot of
housekeepers are undocumented,

19:27.797 --> 19:29.164
this crew knows they won't come forward

19:29.199 --> 19:30.566
because they're afraid of being deported.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.167
They're doing it with
families still home,

19:32.202 --> 19:34.002
which means they need
someone there who knows

19:34.037 --> 19:35.194
the combination to the safe.

19:35.229 --> 19:37.139
One piece of informationthe
housekeepers can't give them.

19:37.173 --> 19:39.241
I got an I.D. on the guy we took down

19:39.275 --> 19:40.476
last night at Sosie's house.

19:40.510 --> 19:42.076
Elvin Villamayor,

19:42.110 --> 19:44.179
convictions of armed robbery
and felony possessions.

19:44.214 --> 19:46.003
With Villamayor dead, they're down a man.

19:46.037 --> 19:47.316
There are at least two more in this crew.

19:47.350 --> 19:48.684
Tech department is still working

19:48.718 --> 19:50.018
to crack the cell phone we recovered.

19:50.053 --> 19:51.920
Maybe that will tell us
who his buddies are.

19:51.955 --> 19:53.489
After losing a man and killing somebody,

19:53.523 --> 19:55.023
this crew probably knows we're onto them.

19:55.058 --> 19:56.758
Probably in panic
mode, which can make them

19:56.793 --> 19:58.694
move faster on their next
home invasion target.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.829
I'll have RHD comb through
Villamayor's known associates,

20:00.864 --> 20:03.031
see if we can't I.D. them that way.

20:03.066 --> 20:04.533
In the meantime, thanks.

20:04.567 --> 20:06.969
Last night was the first
real break in this case.

20:07.003 --> 20:08.804
I'll keep you updated
on what we find out.

20:08.838 --> 20:10.806
- Likewise, Detective.
- Rocker.

20:10.840 --> 20:13.442
Hold up. I got something for you.

20:13.476 --> 20:16.111
What, more SWAT rules from the master?

20:16.146 --> 20:17.946
"Slow is fast." "We work as a pack."

20:17.981 --> 20:20.716
I think I got it.
Hey, hey, hey. Rein it in, cowboy.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.952
I still outrank
you for the next 24 hours.

20:23.987 --> 20:26.155
It's a SWAT tradition
to pass on a good-luck charm

20:26.189 --> 20:27.489
to the next team leader.

20:27.524 --> 20:29.331
I could give you this pocketknife

20:29.365 --> 20:33.896
and tell you a story about
how it magically saved my life.

20:35.331 --> 20:36.665
But the truth is,

20:36.699 --> 20:38.734
we make our own magic.

20:38.768 --> 20:41.870
Over two decades on this job,
you try to do as much good

20:41.905 --> 20:44.106
as you can before
you cash in your pension.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.772
But you're never really sure it's enough.

20:49.212 --> 20:52.748
You know? That you did some lasting good.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.884
So,

20:55.919 --> 21:00.022
my gift to you is a rare moment
of sincere praise.

21:01.368 --> 21:02.591
You worked hard.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.992
You made sergeant-two.

21:04.027 --> 21:05.727
And you are definitely ready

21:05.762 --> 21:07.529
to take over as 50-David.

21:11.295 --> 21:12.868
So I don't get the knife?

21:20.513 --> 21:21.944
Hey.

21:22.431 --> 21:24.246
Rocker's gonna do just fine.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.681
There's no knock there,

21:26.268 --> 21:28.116
but it should've been you, man.

21:28.151 --> 21:30.953
Leading a team has
always been your dream.

21:30.987 --> 21:33.889
Eh, it was my choice
to let that dream go.

21:35.091 --> 21:37.154
I made my bed.

21:38.394 --> 21:41.196
Besides, with Annie and a fourth kid...

21:41.231 --> 21:43.532
eh, what do I need extra aggravation

21:43.566 --> 21:44.967
and demands on my time for?

21:48.438 --> 21:50.038
Enjoy your family.

21:50.751 --> 21:53.087
Kids will be grown and out
before you know it.

22:05.622 --> 22:06.725
Ms. Franklin.

22:08.458 --> 22:10.459
Thanks for coming by. Appreciate
you going above and beyond.

22:10.493 --> 22:12.594
I do it for the kids I'm trying to place.

22:12.629 --> 22:15.130
So what'd you think about the Hamiltons?

22:17.133 --> 22:19.134
How many foster kids
have you placed with them?

22:19.168 --> 22:21.470
I'd say four, maybe five.

22:21.504 --> 22:23.939
Never had a complaint. Why?

22:23.973 --> 22:25.440
They seemed like really nice people,

22:25.475 --> 22:27.663
and-and their home, it was beautiful.

22:29.445 --> 22:32.459
But all I saw was rules and discipline.

22:33.182 --> 22:34.616
I didn't see any affection.

22:35.504 --> 22:37.325
Don't get me wrong, I mean, trust me,

22:37.360 --> 22:39.755
Darryl needs his fair share of rules,

22:39.789 --> 22:41.757
but the boy needs approval now, too.

22:41.791 --> 22:44.293
He needs to know that somebody
truly cares about him,

22:44.327 --> 22:45.927
because he's never had that before,

22:47.391 --> 22:48.797
and this-this couple, I...

22:48.831 --> 22:50.906
You think they're doing it
for the monthly checks.

22:50.941 --> 22:53.468
They just seemed like they had
kids coming and going.

22:53.503 --> 22:55.537
It's, like, once one turns 18
and the money stops,

22:55.571 --> 22:58.819
I mean... the kid's a ghost,

22:59.402 --> 23:01.036
and then they're just on to the next.

23:01.061 --> 23:03.229
It felt like a factory.

23:03.254 --> 23:05.743
Now, I understand that
their intentions are good,

23:07.650 --> 23:10.552
but Darryl's only got one more
chance to make this thing work.

23:12.221 --> 23:14.460
Look, I'm trying really hard
not to judge here.

23:14.857 --> 23:17.046
I know that they take on
what most people don't.

23:19.062 --> 23:23.131
Darryl is a teenage felon.
An African-American male.

23:23.166 --> 23:25.701
And kids who fit that description

23:25.735 --> 23:28.370
never get placed. They usually
end up in a group home.

23:28.404 --> 23:29.638
Yeah, I know.

23:29.672 --> 23:31.473
I just think Darryl deserves better,

23:31.507 --> 23:33.141
or this isn't gonna go well at all.

23:33.176 --> 23:34.576
Yeah, well, they all deserve better,

23:34.610 --> 23:35.811
but this is the reality

23:35.845 --> 23:37.691
for kids like that.

23:39.682 --> 23:42.321
Can I get just a little
more time to think on it?

23:44.354 --> 23:45.491
Sure.

23:46.956 --> 23:49.091
But this spot's not gonna last forever.

23:50.727 --> 23:52.164
Let me know.

23:56.698 --> 23:58.132
Talk to us, Tan.

23:58.157 --> 24:00.589
Tech finally cracked
Elvin Villamayor's cell phone.

24:00.870 --> 24:03.248
They find anything to link us to
the other members of his crew?

24:03.273 --> 24:04.640
No, these guys were careful.

24:04.665 --> 24:06.399
All recent calls were to burner numbers.

24:06.424 --> 24:08.013
But Rubina found something.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.680
That's Sosie, the woman
from Luca and Street's neighborhood.

24:11.714 --> 24:13.615
We were able to match all the women

24:13.649 --> 24:15.684
to homes that have been
hit, except this one.

24:16.230 --> 24:17.786
Number 27 bus.

24:17.820 --> 24:18.954
That's East Hollywood again.

24:18.988 --> 24:20.389
A lot of housekeepers take that line

24:20.423 --> 24:22.224
to go to wealthy homes on the Westside.

24:22.258 --> 24:24.002
Street sign, Hyperion Avenue.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.394
When was the photo taken?

24:25.419 --> 24:26.686
Yesterday. It's the most recent one.

24:26.963 --> 24:28.930
She's got to be their next target.

24:45.681 --> 24:47.482
- Immigration Customs Enforcement.
- What?

24:47.517 --> 24:49.221
- Need you to come with us.
- Why?

25:07.005 --> 25:08.939
Look, we know this
community's tight-knit.

25:08.973 --> 25:11.342
Somebody here can I.D.
this woman, you know?

25:11.376 --> 25:13.110
Won't be easy getting them to talk

25:13.144 --> 25:15.412
when they're afraid we'll ask
their immigration status.

25:15.447 --> 25:16.914
Hey, Shorty.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.282
- Shorty, hold up, man. Shorty.
- Come here.

25:18.316 --> 25:20.351
Hey, Shorty, come here. Hold up, hold up.

25:20.385 --> 25:22.419
I got no beef with you, man.
Just come here.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.021
We're just trying to find this woman.

25:24.923 --> 25:26.357
You know who she is?

25:27.592 --> 25:28.927
You know her, don't you?

25:29.561 --> 25:33.030
That's Rosario. My brother knows her.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.994
We need Rosario's work address right now.

25:38.019 --> 25:40.289
- She's in serious danger.
- Oh, yeah? From who?

25:40.898 --> 25:42.570
Most of the neighborhood's scared of you.

25:42.595 --> 25:44.730
We get that, but we're not ICE,
and neither are the guys

25:44.755 --> 25:47.554
that are after Rosario.
Every second we waste, her life

25:47.579 --> 25:49.646
- is in more danger.
- Can you help us or not?

25:50.982 --> 25:52.449
Rosario's like family.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.485
She took care of my abuela
when she got sick.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.186
Well, now's your chance
to return the favor.

25:56.221 --> 25:59.041
- Her family hates cops.
- Yeah, but she trusts you.

25:59.611 --> 26:01.512
Look, all gentrification jokes aside,

26:01.537 --> 26:04.172
you've seen us around here for
months now. You know who we are

26:04.197 --> 26:06.498
and how we roll: helping people,
trying to make things better.

26:06.664 --> 26:09.566
Look, if you care about
these people the way you claim,

26:09.601 --> 26:11.668
why are we the only ones who give a damn

26:11.703 --> 26:12.971
about finding Rosario?

26:15.072 --> 26:16.439
Fine, man.

26:17.643 --> 26:18.810
Okay.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.414
Sometimes I give her
a ride to work, all right?

26:23.857 --> 26:25.315
She cleans a house for some family

26:25.350 --> 26:28.218
named de Leon in Beverly Glen.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.838
- Thank you, man.
- Thanks, man.

26:30.522 --> 26:33.590
- She really in danger?
- Yeah, she is.

26:33.625 --> 26:34.992
Get her back safe.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.453
That's the plan.

26:40.619 --> 26:42.353
- Bang this left, Luca.
- Yeah.

26:50.197 --> 26:51.275
Okay, what?

26:51.309 --> 26:52.976
Just happy to have you back, Deac.

26:56.230 --> 26:57.910
Hey, Captain, we're five minutes out.

26:57.937 --> 26:59.416
I had a uni in the area

26:59.451 --> 27:01.685
stop by the de Leon house.
No sign of anything.

27:01.719 --> 27:03.021
According to Patrol's report,

27:03.055 --> 27:04.849
the only person home was the dog walker.

27:04.883 --> 27:06.890
He said the family's on vacation in Bali.

27:06.925 --> 27:08.859
- Then we're missing something.
- This crew's M.O. is to strike

27:08.893 --> 27:10.093
while the homeowners are inside.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.562
They're not a burglary crew.

27:11.596 --> 27:13.363
It's strictly home invasion.
Captain, if Rosario's

27:13.398 --> 27:14.765
not at the de Leons' house,

27:14.799 --> 27:16.467
- where else might she be?
- Here's something.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.635
The dog walker said Rosario
sometimes cleans house

27:18.670 --> 27:20.370
for a woman named Shelly Baker.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.430
- Tan, look up information on...
- Already on it, boss.

27:22.455 --> 27:26.024
We got a Baker four blocks
west on Goodman Drive.

27:26.049 --> 27:28.017
House is registered with
Grey Strike Security.

27:28.042 --> 27:29.876
The Bakers probably gave Rosario
their security code.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.982
Luca, get us over there right now.

27:36.920 --> 27:38.321
All right, thank you.

27:38.456 --> 27:39.723
The security company says somebody

27:39.757 --> 27:41.158
accessed the Bakers' passcode,

27:41.192 --> 27:42.459
entered it into the home security system,

27:42.494 --> 27:43.927
then turned the power off.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.329
If something's going down in that house

27:45.363 --> 27:46.597
right now, authorities won't be notified.

27:46.631 --> 27:48.165
This place is a $10 million fortress.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.067
Security cameras everywhere.
They'll see us coming.

27:50.101 --> 27:52.102
Unless we shut down those cameras.

27:52.136 --> 27:53.255
All right, listen up.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.114
We got no time to grab
the house's layout.

27:55.139 --> 27:56.966
Once we cut that camera feed,

27:56.991 --> 27:59.459
we locate the Bakers and Rosario
and we get them to safety.

27:59.484 --> 28:01.121
- Roger that.
- Chris, you're with me.

28:01.813 --> 28:04.014
We need eyes in the sky.
Send up the drone.

28:14.923 --> 28:16.778
This is 20-David in
position on the one side.

28:16.803 --> 28:18.722
30-David in position on the three side.

28:29.153 --> 28:30.454
Got anything from the drone?

28:32.736 --> 28:33.877
All clear.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.712
- All right, on my signal.
- Okay. Yeah.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.439
Security company cut the feed.

28:37.474 --> 28:38.867
All right, go. Go, go, go.

28:39.350 --> 28:40.494
Tan.

28:41.578 --> 28:44.655
Camera's just died.
We need to get out of here now.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.256
I'm not ending up dead like Elvin.

28:47.572 --> 28:49.940
Go start the car. I'll finish up here.

29:05.015 --> 29:06.416
Go.

29:08.379 --> 29:09.913
Get up. Move.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.882
Up, up, up, up, up, up. Let's go.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.383
25-David. We got five heat signatures

29:13.418 --> 29:14.685
on the south side of the house.

29:14.719 --> 29:15.798
Movement indicates panic.

29:15.832 --> 29:18.288
22-David. In position on the two side.

29:21.626 --> 29:23.427
Hey! Out of the car!

29:23.461 --> 29:25.262
- Hands! Out of the car!
- Out of the car right now!

29:25.296 --> 29:27.667
26-David.
We have a suspect on the two side,

29:27.701 --> 29:29.533
- - barricaded in a black sedan.
- Move.

29:29.567 --> 29:30.734
- Get out!
- Out of the car!

29:30.768 --> 29:32.181
- Drop the weapon.
- Out now!

29:32.216 --> 29:33.646
- Drop the weapon.
- Get out!

29:33.680 --> 29:35.194
No!

29:40.712 --> 29:43.614
- Out of the car! Now!
- Out of the car right now. Right now.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.354
LAPD SWAT. Drop the gun.

29:51.389 --> 29:53.590
Slow down. Slow down.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.683
I need a car for me and my new family,

29:55.717 --> 29:58.128
or we all going to Heaven today.

30:04.948 --> 30:06.948
Finally ID'd their crew

30:06.981 --> 30:09.453
Prison tat on our dead guy
gave us Isco Ortiz,

30:09.488 --> 30:11.385
lengthy record.

30:11.419 --> 30:12.808
Guy inside has to be Harold Mays.

30:12.833 --> 30:14.388
They did time together
in Soledad for burglary.

30:14.422 --> 30:16.290
Harold has to be what passes as
the brains of the operation.

30:16.324 --> 30:18.816
He ordered a car or he
starts shooting hostages.

30:18.850 --> 30:20.196
No way we're gonna let that happen, man.

30:20.230 --> 30:21.794
What do you suggest, Luca?

30:21.819 --> 30:23.278
If he wants a car, why don't
we just give him one?

30:23.313 --> 30:25.065
I can think of a million reasons
why that's a bad idea.

30:25.099 --> 30:26.466
Yeah, I know, Deac, but hear him out.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.098
Street's got a plan, and
it's gonna work, right?

30:28.132 --> 30:29.895
- Right.
- Right.

30:31.372 --> 30:33.243
All right, Harold, listen to me.

30:33.277 --> 30:34.909
You wanted my team pulled back?
You got it.

30:34.943 --> 30:36.076
The street is clear.

30:36.110 --> 30:38.871
You wanted a fast car and
free passage? You got that,

30:38.871 --> 30:40.488
but only if you keep
your part of the deal

30:40.513 --> 30:42.803
- and release the Baker family.
- I'm keeping one hostage

30:43.008 --> 30:44.542
to make sure you don't
go back on your word.

30:44.576 --> 30:45.910
I will keep my word.

30:45.944 --> 30:47.712
Let the Bakers go,
or the deal is off, man.

30:47.746 --> 30:48.846
Soon as I see a car.

30:48.881 --> 30:50.682
I see a car, I let them go.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.267
Street.

30:54.292 --> 30:55.559
You're up.

31:15.420 --> 31:17.575
Come on, move, move, move,
move, move. Out this way.

31:17.609 --> 31:18.710
Out this way, behind me.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.111
Move, move, move. Come on.

31:20.145 --> 31:22.213
Slow, slow, slow. Take it easy.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.470
Here we go, Street.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.038
- You ready for this?
- Affirmative.

31:47.072 --> 31:50.408
Operation Hack My Ride is...

31:50.442 --> 31:51.709
a go.

31:55.781 --> 31:56.914
What the hell?

31:56.949 --> 31:59.038
Show me your hands!

31:59.073 --> 32:00.151
Show me your... Drop your weapon!

32:00.185 --> 32:02.787
Drop it! Drop it! Out
of the car now! Now!

32:02.821 --> 32:04.270
- Out of the car.
- Get on the ground.

32:04.305 --> 32:05.957
Hands behind your back.

32:05.991 --> 32:09.260
Rosario? Hey.

32:09.294 --> 32:11.062
- Hey, you okay?
- Hang on. Listen to me.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.097
I'm Luca. This... this is Street, okay?
You all right?

32:13.132 --> 32:14.832
We're with SWAT. I know.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.435
I know you from the neighborhood.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.904
Thank you so much.

32:24.215 --> 32:26.083
That was a nice plan out there today.

32:26.108 --> 32:28.176
Oh, thanks.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.181
Yeah, it's, uh...

32:30.215 --> 32:32.083
it's got its perks, you know.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.252
Working undercover in car theft.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.288
Plus, uh, all this time
the past few months

32:37.322 --> 32:39.957
hanging out with Whip basically taught me

32:39.992 --> 32:42.994
everything I need to know
about hacking high-end rides.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.097
Well, I guess you got a backup career

32:46.131 --> 32:47.598
if you ever stop being a cop.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.101
Let's hope it never comes to that.

32:50.594 --> 32:52.428
Well, it was smart work. Good job.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.670
Thanks, man.

32:55.133 --> 32:56.967
Listen, uh, Street.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.812
I need a favor.

33:03.590 --> 33:05.516
It's, uh...

33:05.551 --> 33:08.186
it's kind of a personal question
to ask you, if that's all right.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.488
Yeah, of course. What's up?

33:12.370 --> 33:14.517
What was it like growing up
in foster care?

33:16.695 --> 33:18.563
Wow.

33:18.597 --> 33:20.164
I wasn't expecting that.

33:20.648 --> 33:22.133
If a kid had a choice between

33:22.167 --> 33:23.801
a foster care family and a group home,

33:23.836 --> 33:25.151
what's the best option, in your opinion?

33:25.186 --> 33:27.004
No experience is the same.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.640
I was in a group home for two months

33:29.675 --> 33:31.676
when I was, like, 14. I got my ass kicked

33:31.710 --> 33:33.411
every day until I learned how to fight.

33:34.162 --> 33:37.181
And there are good foster
situations out there.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.426
It's-it's just... for some...

33:39.451 --> 33:42.753
you know, it's... it's just a job.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.590
You know, it's three hots,
a cot and out the door at 18.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.592
You turned out pretty good.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.708
How'd you survive it?

33:48.733 --> 33:50.000
Well, you know, I...

33:50.025 --> 33:51.960
I had the one person...

33:51.985 --> 33:54.186
who I knew really cared about me.

33:54.724 --> 33:56.255
I wasn't living with him,

33:56.280 --> 33:58.759
but... you know,
he was always there for me.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.538
No matter what.

34:00.563 --> 34:01.839
Buck.

34:02.273 --> 34:03.474
Yeah.

34:04.456 --> 34:05.652
Sometimes...

34:06.231 --> 34:09.500
that one person...
makes all the difference.

34:19.804 --> 34:21.972
Hey, how was your
last wild ride, Mumford?

34:22.261 --> 34:25.096
Here I thought I wasn't
gonna get emotional.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.797
Listen, I got to handle

34:26.831 --> 34:28.475
some business back home,
so if I don't see you

34:28.500 --> 34:30.626
before you leave, I just want you to know

34:30.650 --> 34:32.217
I'm really going to miss kicking you

34:32.243 --> 34:33.795
and your team's ass
in the Baker-to-Vegas race.

34:33.820 --> 34:36.704
You know I had to let you win.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.309
I didn't want you to
lose your confidence.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.944
Yeah, yeah. I hear you, I hear you.

34:39.978 --> 34:41.646
Well, now that you're leaving,
Rocker better watch out.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.447
- Because it's payback time.
- Yeah, well, you push him

34:43.482 --> 34:46.284
half as hard as I pushed you,
it'll only make him better.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.752
That's right.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.186
You sure you're ready to retire?

34:52.543 --> 34:54.212
I'm ready.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.579
Nikki and I got plans that don't include

34:56.614 --> 34:59.597
- me getting shot at anymore.
- I feel you on that.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.124
Don't be a stranger, you hear me?

35:01.239 --> 35:03.107
We got your back if you ever need us.

35:05.123 --> 35:06.624
Be safe out there, brother.

35:07.184 --> 35:08.756
You too, old-timer.

35:12.969 --> 35:14.345
Go enjoy your life.

35:14.379 --> 35:16.134
- Be good, man.
- All right.

35:17.009 --> 35:18.843
"Old-timer"?

35:44.875 --> 35:46.169
Hey.

35:47.452 --> 35:48.752
What's up? Something wrong?

35:48.777 --> 35:51.112
Everything is fine, sweetie.

35:51.137 --> 35:52.538
D...

35:52.563 --> 35:54.231
We need to talk.

35:54.594 --> 35:56.020
Why don't you grab a seat?

36:04.768 --> 36:06.356
I met the Hamiltons.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.700
And they seem like decent,
hardworking folk.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.402
Home is clean, everything was in order.

36:11.861 --> 36:13.371
And the few foster kids I saw,

36:13.405 --> 36:14.939
they seemed really grateful to be there.

36:17.149 --> 36:18.883
But that's not the right family for you.

36:18.908 --> 36:20.775
That's just code word
for they don't want me.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.300
- It's nothing new.
- No, no, no, no, no.

36:22.325 --> 36:23.592
They were perfectly happy to have you

36:23.617 --> 36:25.017
placed with them; it's just that,

36:25.042 --> 36:26.676
that family doesn't have
the love that you need

36:26.701 --> 36:28.468
to grow into the man
that you're gonna become.

36:28.493 --> 36:31.851
Yeah, whatever. I-I'm not afraid
to go to a group home.

36:31.876 --> 36:33.855
I'm not gonna let them
put you in a group home.

36:36.428 --> 36:39.263
We have a different idea.

36:40.819 --> 36:42.094
Darryl.

36:43.348 --> 36:46.717
We both want you to stay here.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.983
But you said this is temporary
'cause you're always at work.

36:52.018 --> 36:54.078
Uh-huh, and that was
before I talked to her.

36:54.570 --> 36:57.301
And before I threatened to knock
some sense into his head.

36:57.335 --> 37:00.117
If I could raise two kids
and hold two jobs

37:00.152 --> 37:02.353
on my own, my tough guy here

37:02.387 --> 37:03.788
can handle one kid,

37:03.822 --> 37:05.222
one job...

37:05.257 --> 37:07.391
with a little help from me.

37:07.426 --> 37:08.978
She's gonna come
around a little more often,

37:09.012 --> 37:10.753
and she's gonna look after
you while I'm at work.

37:12.505 --> 37:13.864
You don't have to do this, man.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.925
No, you're right...
I don't have to do it.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.703
I want to do it.

37:33.452 --> 37:34.785
Thank you.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.454
Hey.

37:39.744 --> 37:42.112
I'm gonna start working toward
being your legal guardian

37:42.137 --> 37:43.671
until you turn 18.

37:43.696 --> 37:46.039
Now, your mom, she can still see you...

37:46.598 --> 37:48.599
but I'm gonna have full custody.

37:49.292 --> 37:50.877
And you're gonna live here with me.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.441
And we're all gonna have
to make sacrifices

37:57.476 --> 37:59.477
in order for this to work.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.912
You're gonna have to promise
to keep working hard

38:01.947 --> 38:04.648
and promise to stay out of trouble.

38:07.769 --> 38:09.228
I-I promise.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.105
Good.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.425
Good.

38:14.459 --> 38:17.461
Welcome to the family, sweetie.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.247
Mm, I've been hounding him for years

38:21.272 --> 38:22.374
- for grandkids.
- No, Mama.

38:22.399 --> 38:24.535
I didn't know I was
gonna get one this big.

38:24.569 --> 38:27.838
At least you
can hang up your own clothes.

38:27.873 --> 38:29.849
Speaking of your clothes,
honey, those underwear,

38:29.883 --> 38:31.001
now, you can't be leaving 'em

38:31.035 --> 38:32.476
- on the floor like that.
- What is that?

38:32.511 --> 38:34.619
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

38:38.350 --> 38:41.152
Yeah!

38:45.223 --> 38:46.557
You didn't think you were

38:46.591 --> 38:48.394
getting out of here
without a party, did you?

38:48.428 --> 38:50.561
Yeah, yeah, I knew... I knew you
guys were all planning something,

38:50.595 --> 38:51.896
but I'm sorry, I can't stick around.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.397
Nikki and I got plans.

38:53.431 --> 38:54.865
Oh, be nice, Jack.

38:56.268 --> 38:57.902
- You're in on this, too?
- Yeah.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.863
What's the harm with a little
celebration of your career?

39:02.114 --> 39:03.507
Did it myself.

39:03.542 --> 39:05.009
What do you think?

39:05.043 --> 39:06.852
The beak is too big.

39:06.886 --> 39:08.145
It's perfect.

39:08.180 --> 39:10.414
We got you a... a little something, too.

39:10.448 --> 39:12.249
A gold watch, but it turns green

39:12.284 --> 39:13.538
- if you get it wet.
- Yeah,

39:13.573 --> 39:15.886
- so don't get it wet.
- All right, now, hey, look,

39:15.921 --> 39:17.021
here's the real gift.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.923
- We all chipped in.
- Yeah.

39:19.340 --> 39:21.592
Season tickets to the Rams?

39:21.626 --> 39:23.060
- Yeah.
- Not bad.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.328
Come on, speech.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.564
Speech! Speech! Speech!

39:29.034 --> 39:31.569
All right, I'm gonna
make it short and sweet.

39:31.603 --> 39:35.072
I'm proud to have served this great city,

39:35.606 --> 39:37.074
and I'm proud to have Donovan Rocker

39:37.108 --> 39:38.587
carry on my legacy

39:38.622 --> 39:39.861
as 50-David.

39:40.202 --> 39:41.612
Although it's gonna

39:41.646 --> 39:43.714
be hard to live up to the legend.

39:46.218 --> 39:48.497
Whoa! Brand-new Corvette. Very nice.

39:48.531 --> 39:51.455
Told you clowns I was
getting out of here in style.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.363
I'll wave to you on the 405.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.560
Actually, Sergeant,

39:56.595 --> 39:59.597
um, Commander Hicks has
one last gift for you.

40:01.318 --> 40:03.593
She'd like to say some parting words.

40:06.762 --> 40:08.138
I know you?

40:08.173 --> 40:09.940
I'm Felicia.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.248
Uh, I'm really good with faces.

40:17.282 --> 40:19.917
I'm sorry, I don't... I don't know yours.

40:20.401 --> 40:24.521
I was just a kid when we met
at a house on Larkmead Avenue.

40:28.839 --> 40:30.273
Larkmead.

40:31.549 --> 40:32.916
Felicia Zizenis?

40:33.832 --> 40:36.333
This was my first week on SWAT.

40:37.596 --> 40:40.838
A guy grabbed me off the
school playground at recess...

40:40.872 --> 40:43.007
back before they had fences
around them all...

40:43.975 --> 40:47.311
put me in his car, drove me to his house.

40:47.845 --> 40:49.599
He put a knife to my throat,

40:49.633 --> 40:51.482
told me how he was gonna kill me.

40:52.850 --> 40:54.518
But then you burst in

40:54.552 --> 40:56.453
and got the knife out of his hand

40:56.488 --> 40:58.188
and had him cuffed on the floor

40:58.223 --> 40:59.607
before he could hurt me.

41:00.698 --> 41:02.699
You saved my life.

41:04.896 --> 41:08.599
When Commander Hicks called me
to say you were retiring,

41:08.633 --> 41:10.701
I knew I had to be here.

41:11.327 --> 41:13.270
Because without you,

41:13.305 --> 41:14.972
I'm not here.

41:15.623 --> 41:17.541
And neither is my family.

41:19.511 --> 41:22.112
I'm a teacher now, and I have a husband

41:22.147 --> 41:23.814
and a daughter.

41:25.317 --> 41:27.751
And I wouldn't have any
of it if not for you.

41:29.178 --> 41:30.788
So thank you...

41:30.822 --> 41:32.848
for all of this.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.253
You son of a bitch.
