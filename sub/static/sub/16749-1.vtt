00:21.683 --> 00:23.287
Yes, now, you
pick out the collar.

00:23.351 --> 00:24.796
You tell me which
one you want.

00:24.852 --> 00:26.225
Which one? Which one?

00:26.287 --> 00:28.062
Yes.

00:28.122 --> 00:31.331
I don't know if there's anything
here I could possibly use.

00:31.392 --> 00:32.029
Mr. Webber?

00:32.093 --> 00:33.037
Yeah.

00:33.094 --> 00:34.232
Matt Reeder,
International Gifts.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.968
Oh, right, right.

00:36.030 --> 00:36.906
Yeah, how are you doing?

00:36.965 --> 00:37.943
Good.

00:37.999 --> 00:38.909
He's not
talking today.

00:38.967 --> 00:40.207
Yeah.

00:40.268 --> 00:42.908
You know, why don't you...
why don't you wait back in the stockroom.

00:42.971 --> 00:44.006
Thank you.

00:44.072 --> 00:47.076
Anything with fur?

00:49.477 --> 00:52.587
- Ooh.
- That's gonna' hurt.

00:52.647 --> 00:54.649
Mulligan?

00:54.716 --> 00:59.222
Is he a member?

01:00.621 --> 01:03.295
Shit.

01:03.358 --> 01:07.363
Oops.

01:07.428 --> 01:09.965
I have a question for you.

01:10.031 --> 01:12.705
Being an employee here, do you
get to play a lot of golf?

01:12.767 --> 01:13.905
Yeah, that's
why I work here.

01:13.968 --> 01:14.776
Yeah?

01:14.836 --> 01:15.746
What's your handicap?

01:15.803 --> 01:16.838
Six.

01:16.904 --> 01:18.110
Me, too!

01:18.172 --> 01:18.877
No, really?

01:18.940 --> 01:19.418
Yeah.

01:19.474 --> 01:20.817
Well, six-pack.

01:20.875 --> 01:23.116
I'm a really good drinker.

01:23.177 --> 01:24.155
That's corny.

01:24.212 --> 01:27.455
I know, that's terrible.

01:27.515 --> 01:30.838
What do you say we...
we hit some balls sometime?

01:30.839 --> 01:32.520
I'll drive the cart around.

01:32.587 --> 01:34.158
I can watch your stroke.

01:34.222 --> 01:35.292
Cinda.

01:35.357 --> 01:36.665
Uhh, Preston.

01:36.724 --> 01:37.429
Hi.

01:37.492 --> 01:38.470
How are you, buddy?

01:38.526 --> 01:39.937
You've got a great smile, man.

01:39.994 --> 01:41.564
You must have a
good dental planner.

01:41.629 --> 01:42.539
Sam Schooler.

01:42.597 --> 01:43.367
How are you?

01:43.431 --> 01:44.637
So, what do you got?

01:44.699 --> 01:47.980
Now, the unique feature
of The Dreaming Dog Watch,

01:48.036 --> 01:51.040
Mr. Webber, is the animation.

01:51.105 --> 01:54.348
As the seconds tick by,
you can actually see what the dog

01:54.409 --> 01:55.945
is dreaming about.

01:56.010 --> 01:57.011
Huh!

01:57.078 --> 02:01.493
I'll be darned!

02:01.549 --> 02:02.357
It's clever.

02:02.417 --> 02:02.687
Yeah.

02:02.751 --> 02:05.861
And if you look, you'll notice
the... all the animation.

02:05.920 --> 02:09.493
We call it
The Frustrated Golfer's Watch.

02:09.556 --> 02:11.036
And you can see all the
curse symbols after you get

02:11.092 --> 02:12.400
a little back slice.

02:12.460 --> 02:13.302
Slut!

02:13.361 --> 02:13.930
You know what I mean?

02:13.995 --> 02:14.769
We've all been there.

02:14.829 --> 02:16.137
I know I have.

02:16.197 --> 02:18.199
It's priced right.

02:18.266 --> 02:19.973
What rates you got?

02:20.034 --> 02:21.911
n is just the
one for the moment.

02:21.969 --> 02:23.073
But we are..

02:23.137 --> 02:25.549
Oh, no, you see, Matt,
my customers would buy this

02:25.606 --> 02:27.381
watch like crazy, okay?

02:27.442 --> 02:30.013
Provided you had
their dog on it.

02:30.078 --> 02:31.079
Oh, hold on.

02:31.145 --> 02:32.647
Call me crazy,
maybe it's just me,

02:32.713 --> 02:34.818
but aren't all your
members golfers?

02:34.882 --> 02:35.860
Uhh, yeah.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.157
And they all wear
watches, don't they?

02:37.218 --> 02:38.959
Yeah, just
not novelty watches.

02:39.020 --> 02:40.397
Ahh, gotcha'.

02:40.455 --> 02:42.366
More of a Rolex crowd.

02:42.757 --> 02:44.624
A lady with a Yorkie
is not going to buy a watch,

02:44.625 --> 02:46.164
as cute as it is,
with a Lab on it.

02:46.227 --> 02:47.297
Well, I know
what you mean...

02:47.361 --> 02:49.500
You gotta' get
all the breeds, all right?

02:49.564 --> 02:51.566
Yeah, see, I like to follow
give

02:51.632 --> 02:54.238
the customer what they want.

02:54.302 --> 02:55.610
You know what I'm saying?

02:55.670 --> 02:57.081
Yeah, I gotta' go.

02:57.138 --> 02:58.082
Careful now.

02:58.139 --> 02:59.948
He jumps.

03:00.007 --> 03:01.680
You're going to tell
me that this isn't quality?

03:01.742 --> 03:03.153
That's exactly what I'm saying.

03:03.211 --> 03:05.122
And I'm also saying that you,
you need to pick up

03:05.179 --> 03:08.626
a book on salesmanship.

03:11.119 --> 03:12.860
Yeah, well,
I wrote that book, buddy!

03:15.823 --> 03:16.631
Hi.

03:16.691 --> 03:18.665
>> Walter,
I see you're still at it.

03:18.726 --> 03:20.205
>> First time I ever
double-crossed the governor.

03:20.261 --> 03:22.537
>> What can I do for you?

03:22.597 --> 03:23.940
>> You mind if I sat down?

03:23.998 --> 03:26.077
>> There's been a lamp burning
in the window for you honey,

03:26.078 --> 03:27.376
>> go ahead.

03:27.435 --> 03:28.539
>> Oh, I jumped out that window
a long time ago...

03:28.603 --> 03:30.480
You can hit your
head against the wall,

03:30.538 --> 03:33.815
try every angle,
rack your brain,

03:33.875 --> 03:38.290
and then one day, out of
the blue, you get an idea.

03:38.346 --> 03:40.485
The big idea.

03:40.548 --> 03:43.119
The one you've
been waiting for.

03:43.184 --> 03:47.894
A chance to win.

03:47.955 --> 03:49.730
I'm going to go to bed, honey.

03:49.790 --> 03:54.205
I've got a six o'clock flight.

03:54.262 --> 04:00.872
Being with Gina made me
want to do anything to win.

04:55.923 --> 04:57.958
- Well, I can appreciate that, sir...
- I'm not here!

04:57.959 --> 05:01.399
...but our accountant
has been super busy.

05:01.462 --> 05:02.668
Mr. Bederman.

05:02.730 --> 05:03.674
Uh-huh.

05:03.731 --> 05:05.938
No, he's in a meeting.

05:06.000 --> 05:06.978
Yes, sir.

05:07.034 --> 05:08.012
All right.

05:08.069 --> 05:09.446
Matt.

05:09.503 --> 05:11.073
It's here!

05:11.138 --> 05:15.018
Brenda, you get a raise.

05:15.076 --> 05:15.577
Sammy!

05:15.643 --> 05:17.020
Huh?

05:17.078 --> 05:19.115
Ooh, is that it?

05:19.180 --> 05:20.682
Yeah, Okay.

05:20.748 --> 05:21.658
Where's Brenda?

05:21.716 --> 05:22.194
Brenda?

05:22.250 --> 05:22.955
Where's she at?

05:23.017 --> 05:24.155
Hold my calls!

05:24.218 --> 05:24.883
Okay.

05:26.154 --> 05:27.155
Now...

05:27.156 --> 05:28.934
I always wanted to sell a million
of something. Let's see this!

05:29.490 --> 05:30.935
I babied this one.

05:30.992 --> 05:33.993
Calling Hong Kong all night,
faxing diagrams...

05:33.994 --> 05:34.961
- ...back and forth.
- Come on, cut the shit!

05:34.962 --> 05:35.428
Let's do this!

05:35.429 --> 05:36.237
Let me see it!

05:36.297 --> 05:42.646
And now, The
Lucky Lottery Watch.

05:42.703 --> 05:43.545
Wow!

05:43.604 --> 05:45.845
Lottery Watch?

05:45.906 --> 05:47.180
That's beautiful!

05:47.241 --> 05:48.413
Six winning numbers.

05:48.476 --> 05:49.580
Wait, is it
different every time?

05:49.644 --> 05:50.588
Totally random.

05:50.645 --> 05:51.953
Wow, It's amazing, man

05:52.013 --> 05:54.118
Imagine how many places we're
going to sell that bad boy!

05:54.181 --> 05:55.592
First of all, everyone
who sells a lottery ticket.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.325
Chain stores,
department stores.

05:57.385 --> 05:58.688
- Vegas!
- Vegas!

05:58.753 --> 05:59.561
Vegas!

05:59.620 --> 06:00.997
We're going to Vegas!

06:01.055 --> 06:02.728
Excuse me, guys,
but product development is

06:02.790 --> 06:04.133
essentially defining
a need, right?

06:04.191 --> 06:05.602
Exactly.

06:05.660 --> 06:06.832
Does someone
playing the lottery

06:06.894 --> 06:08.874
really a watch
to pick their numbers?

06:08.929 --> 06:10.468
Bean! Bean!

06:11.966 --> 06:13.468
This is not a watch.

06:14.034 --> 06:14.808
Nope.

06:14.869 --> 06:18.339
We, you and I,
are selling a dream!

06:18.406 --> 06:19.350
That's right, baby.

06:19.407 --> 06:20.408
Hold this, take it.

06:20.474 --> 06:21.509
Sixty million people
play the lottery.

06:21.575 --> 06:23.748
This is a product
that cannot miss.

06:23.811 --> 06:26.410
We have a storeroom full of
products that can't miss.

06:26.412 --> 06:27.953
We got the
remote control beer mug.

06:28.014 --> 06:28.860
There's thousands of those.

06:28.916 --> 06:30.054
We've got that handbag.

06:30.117 --> 06:31.452
Bad ideal.

06:31.518 --> 06:32.526
And the Fish Stories Clock?

06:32.586 --> 06:33.462
Guys!

06:33.521 --> 06:36.462
Whoa, whoa, hey,
Professor Positive.

06:36.524 --> 06:38.834
You didn't even invent that.

06:38.893 --> 06:40.497
Yeah, I like it.

06:40.561 --> 06:41.369
Amazing!

06:41.429 --> 06:42.908
It's good, man.

06:42.963 --> 06:44.374
Let's make a million, huh?

06:50.938 --> 06:52.975
You push this button on
the side of the case

06:53.040 --> 06:55.748
and 6 numbers pop up.

06:55.810 --> 06:57.016
6 numbers.

06:57.078 --> 07:00.855
Different numbers every time.

07:00.915 --> 07:03.623
How's he come up
with all these ideas?

07:03.684 --> 07:04.890
Well,
believe it or not,

07:04.952 --> 07:08.866
he used to claim it was the
hops, you know, in beer.

07:08.923 --> 07:12.166
Now it's the universal mind.

07:12.226 --> 07:14.103
The universal mind.

07:14.161 --> 07:16.732
Their bookkeepers
theory is all ideas come from

07:16.797 --> 07:19.368
some kind of collective
consciousness,

07:19.433 --> 07:23.813
one universal mind.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.350
OK.

07:25.406 --> 07:26.646
I know.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.976
But to Matt, you know,
it made perfect sense that

07:29.977 --> 07:33.012
all ideas are floating around
in space like some kind of

07:33.013 --> 07:38.823
old radio and TV broadcast,
and his mind is a receiving station.

07:41.789 --> 07:43.860
A receiving station.

07:43.924 --> 07:45.665
I know he's a little off.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.262
Yes, but that's
why you liked him.

07:47.328 --> 07:48.238
I know.

07:48.295 --> 07:50.935
That's what I've
always liked about him.

08:01.018 --> 08:03.020
You keep dreaming up the
ideas, buddy, I'll sell them.

08:03.087 --> 08:03.656
I will.

08:03.721 --> 08:04.392
That's for sure.

08:04.455 --> 08:04.956
You know what I mean?

08:05.022 --> 08:06.000
Yeah.

08:06.057 --> 08:08.628
Now, we are going to
need seed money

08:08.693 --> 08:11.799
for the new watch.

08:11.862 --> 08:13.705
No, we're not going
to the casino, okay?

08:13.764 --> 08:14.708
Read my lips.

08:14.765 --> 08:15.743
We're not going to the casino.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.074
We're not
going to the casino.

08:17.134 --> 08:17.612
That's right.

08:17.668 --> 08:19.443
All right.

08:19.503 --> 08:20.413
We're going
to the dog track.

08:20.471 --> 08:22.815
That is the
same difference.

08:22.873 --> 08:23.715
It's a big difference.

08:23.774 --> 08:25.151
It's a dog track,
it's not a casino.

08:25.209 --> 08:27.985
And if Gina asks you, "Did
you go to the casino?"

08:28.045 --> 08:28.750
And she will!

08:28.813 --> 08:29.757
Fine.

08:29.814 --> 08:32.419
Say no with authority,
because it's true.

08:32.482 --> 08:33.120
It's not the casino.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.663
Say, "No, goddamn it, Gina!

08:34.719 --> 08:36.460
I did not go to
the fucking casino!

08:36.520 --> 08:38.227
I told you I
wouldn't, didn't I?"

08:38.289 --> 08:38.698
Yeah.

08:38.756 --> 08:39.826
Right?

08:39.890 --> 08:40.994
You gotta' turn it around
On them just like that.

08:47.333 --> 08:50.437
>> It's Bayou by a bundle!

08:50.501 --> 08:54.074
Sam loves to
gamble on anything.

08:54.138 --> 08:56.709
"Will the temperature
hit a hundred tomorrow?"

08:56.774 --> 08:59.152
"I bet you I can
eat six jalapenos."

08:59.210 --> 09:01.952
It cost him a lot of
money, and two marriages.

09:02.013 --> 09:03.617
But he shrugs it off.

09:03.681 --> 09:04.819
Three or four?

09:04.882 --> 09:09.160
Your dumb dog on that one.

09:09.220 --> 09:11.962
I like it, let's do it.

09:12.590 --> 09:13.660
Whoa.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.362
While we have this
moment, look, look, look!

09:15.426 --> 09:16.461
What?

09:16.527 --> 09:17.528
See that
dog taking a shit?

09:17.595 --> 09:19.131
Look at him. Look at him.

09:19.196 --> 09:20.072
Yeah?

09:20.131 --> 09:20.905
Number 2!

09:20.965 --> 09:21.636
Number 2! Number 2!

09:21.699 --> 09:22.803
Our luck is about to change.

09:22.867 --> 09:23.777
2... 2... 2.

09:24.084 --> 09:24.892
Can Do!

09:24.952 --> 09:26.192
Can Do!

09:26.253 --> 09:27.493
This is the one, bro!

09:27.555 --> 09:28.761
No, no, man.

09:28.822 --> 09:30.267
Look, he's coming
down from a beating.

09:30.324 --> 09:32.235
Okay, listen to me.

09:32.293 --> 09:35.274
Ahh, a jockey told Carl, the
bartender, that if you see a

09:35.329 --> 09:38.572
horse shit before a race,
you bet all you got on him.

09:38.632 --> 09:39.474
He said that.

09:39.533 --> 09:41.570
The dog is shitting,
and that's why

09:41.635 --> 09:42.579
you're betting on him?

09:42.636 --> 09:44.309
Yeah. Think about
it. Look at me!

09:44.371 --> 09:45.179
He's 22 to 1.

09:45.239 --> 09:46.149
Come on, it
makes sense, right?

09:46.206 --> 09:48.618
He's lighter, he's
happy, he's relaxed.

09:48.676 --> 09:49.381
It's horrible!

09:49.443 --> 09:50.421
Think about it.

09:50.477 --> 09:51.683
Let's do this, all right?

09:51.745 --> 09:52.587
Come on, he's a jockey.

09:52.646 --> 09:53.522
Why would he lie?

09:53.581 --> 09:54.616
Now, calm down,
let's take it slow.

09:54.682 --> 09:55.683
We just got here, Okay?

09:55.749 --> 09:56.591
Okay, so
how much you got?

09:56.650 --> 09:57.788
I got two $20.

09:57.851 --> 10:01.791
Can I have a 10 dollar
two-four on...,

10:01.792 --> 10:03.875
and a 10 dollar 2-8 on...?

10:03.876 --> 10:04.950
Fuck! Great!

10:07.127 --> 10:09.733
$400 on 2, Can-Do, to win.

10:09.797 --> 10:11.534
Thank you.

10:11.599 --> 10:15.104
I said tickets.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.053
Put away your money.

10:16.370 --> 10:17.713
Here comes the bunny!

10:17.714 --> 10:23.786
And two, let's go, baby!

10:23.844 --> 10:25.255
>> And they're off!

10:25.313 --> 10:29.989
>> ...jump in the lead, followed by
>> Late-For-Dinner and Can-Do!

10:31.152 --> 10:32.960
>> They're going
into the first turn!

10:33.020 --> 10:36.297
>> Down in the back stretch.
>> Flea's-Ferrari chases down

10:36.357 --> 10:38.394
>> the number 2 Can-Do.

10:38.459 --> 10:44.705
>> Can Do gets passed.
>> As they head for the wire,

10:44.765 --> 10:48.178
>> It's Flea's-Ferrari pulling
>> away now by a length!

10:48.235 --> 10:53.878
>> Flea's-Ferrari takes it!

10:53.941 --> 10:56.615
$400 on the dog shit theory.

10:56.677 --> 11:00.215
You should be proud.

11:00.281 --> 11:02.887
Fucking Can-Do bullshit.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.554
I can't blame Sam.

11:04.618 --> 11:07.531
He was just trying to raise
money for our business.

11:07.588 --> 11:10.728
Sam did construction for a
while before we teamed up.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.737
Me, I've never had a job.

11:12.793 --> 11:14.568
I've always worked for myself.

11:14.628 --> 11:18.906
It can be tough, long hours,
no guaranteed paycheck.

11:18.966 --> 11:21.344
But you have a chance to win.

11:21.869 --> 11:22.445
Bye, girl.

11:22.503 --> 11:23.474
Bye, sweetie.

11:23.537 --> 11:25.380
Bye, see ya'-

11:33.681 --> 11:36.355
So I go out there and the gate
agent ask me for volunteers,

11:36.417 --> 11:37.987
you know, to give
up their seats.

11:38.052 --> 11:39.793
Sounded like a game show host.

11:39.854 --> 11:41.561
"A voucher for a
room at the Marriott,

11:41.622 --> 11:44.702
and we'll get you out
on the 7 A.M. non-stop.

11:44.759 --> 11:45.863
Anybody?"

11:45.926 --> 11:48.736
So these two guys sitting
there yell, "Throw her in",

11:48.796 --> 11:50.867
'pointing at me,
"We'll do it."

11:50.931 --> 11:54.811
Ahh, smart guys.

11:54.869 --> 11:57.247
So what's new here?

11:57.304 --> 11:58.476
Nothing, really.

11:58.539 --> 12:00.314
Just the same old, same old,
looking after cash flow,

12:00.374 --> 12:03.378
you know.

12:03.444 --> 12:04.855
You guys haven't
been by the casino,

12:04.912 --> 12:06.323
trying to help it, have you?

12:06.380 --> 12:07.324
No.

12:07.381 --> 12:11.591
I, ur,... I told you
I wouldn't, didn't I?

12:11.652 --> 12:14.758
Just asking,
Matt, just asking.

12:14.822 --> 12:17.928
Well, I am
just telling you.

12:17.992 --> 12:20.632
Good.

12:20.694 --> 12:22.230
Oh, I can't wait to get
out of this uniform

12:22.296 --> 12:23.604
and take a shower

12:23.664 --> 12:25.200
And I can't
wait for that either.

12:39.146 --> 12:41.353
Oh, guess what
the big rumor is at work.

12:41.415 --> 12:43.691
Southwest buying
you out, that one?

12:43.751 --> 12:46.357
They're going to be
offering an early retirement.

12:46.420 --> 12:47.956
Retirement?

12:48.022 --> 12:48.966
For you?

12:49.023 --> 12:51.128
You're too young and
sexy to be retired.

12:51.192 --> 12:56.484
With a cash incentive,
twenty-some thousand.

12:59.033 --> 13:01.035
Twenty thousand?

13:01.101 --> 13:02.512
Of course, I can't even
think about it until your

13:02.570 --> 13:07.986
business does something,
we pay down our cards.

13:08.042 --> 13:10.989
I don't think you'll
be waiting too much longer.

13:11.045 --> 13:13.286
It's like Thomas Edison
said, "To have a great idea,

13:13.347 --> 13:15.452
you've got to have
a lot of them."

13:15.516 --> 13:17.792
Yeah, but while we're
waiting on that light bulb,

13:17.852 --> 13:19.832
we're getting in
deeper and deeper.

13:19.887 --> 13:21.127
Come on.

13:21.188 --> 13:26.604
Every bad idea I have just
gets us closer, and closer,

13:27.660 --> 13:36.445
and closer to a really,
really, really good idea.

13:36.504 --> 13:38.643
Oh, I've got a
really good idea.

13:38.706 --> 13:40.014
I've been
up since six, baby.

13:40.074 --> 13:46.650
I've been up about
a minute and a half.

14:17.878 --> 14:20.358
So I said,
"Care for a calzone, sir?"

14:20.414 --> 14:22.758
And he, real
uppity-like goes, "Miss,

14:22.816 --> 14:24.124
you don't know what
you're serving.

14:24.184 --> 14:25.026
I'm Italian.

14:25.085 --> 14:26.826
It's pronounced calzon-e.

14:26.887 --> 14:28.560
You emphasize the 'e'.

14:28.622 --> 14:30.863
If you're going to serve it,
learn how to pronounce it."

14:30.925 --> 14:33.098
I just moved the
cart on up the aisle.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.504
Yeah, sister...

14:35.563 --> 14:36.803
Exactly.

14:36.864 --> 14:38.434
Then my friend Rita, who's on
the other side of the cart,

14:38.499 --> 14:41.742
leans back and says,
"Hey, Gina,

14:41.802 --> 14:44.800
would that be
asshole or asshol-e?"

14:48.842 --> 14:52.585
You're not real into it.

14:52.646 --> 14:53.349
Another round?

14:53.350 --> 14:55.222
I'd be really good
after a few of these.

14:55.652 --> 14:57.849
So, I think it's great you
guys have been friends

14:57.850 --> 14:58.824
since high school.

14:58.886 --> 15:00.524
I don't even
know that guy.

15:00.588 --> 15:02.659
I could tell
you some stories.

15:02.723 --> 15:04.202
Please don't say
anything, come on, man.

15:04.258 --> 15:06.295
Gina, you know, she still
thinks I'm a nice guy.

15:06.360 --> 15:07.430
No, I don't

15:07.494 --> 15:09.531
I knew you were an asshole
the minute I met you.

15:09.597 --> 15:10.905
I don't have
to pretend anything.

15:10.965 --> 15:12.035
No, you don't, baby.

15:12.099 --> 15:15.410
No pretending.

15:24.545 --> 15:29.545
I'm really glad
we're all together.

15:35.489 --> 15:37.901
So anyways, thank
you, dickhead.

15:37.958 --> 15:38.532
Sure, buddy.

15:38.593 --> 15:41.204
G, you know that Cinda's
going to be coming with us

15:41.261 --> 15:42.740
to the expo, you know that?

15:42.796 --> 15:43.797
Oh, really?

15:43.864 --> 15:47.277
Fill out orders,
you know the ropes.

15:47.334 --> 15:48.335
That's right.

15:48.402 --> 15:51.178
I don't know the first
thing about the watches.

15:51.238 --> 15:52.979
Babe, you don't have to.

15:53.040 --> 15:55.020
All you got to do is be
a goddess like you are,

15:55.075 --> 15:56.145
a big smile.

15:56.210 --> 15:57.382
You know what I mean?

15:57.444 --> 15:58.286
And say, "It's animated!"

15:58.345 --> 16:00.621
It's animated!

16:00.681 --> 16:02.126
Not like that
like we practiced.

16:02.182 --> 16:03.252
Like you did it.

16:03.317 --> 16:05.490
Hey, excuse me.

16:05.552 --> 16:06.394
You want to win a
million dollars

16:06.453 --> 16:09.696
with the touch of a button?

16:09.757 --> 16:10.633
I do..

16:10.691 --> 16:11.465
Push the button.

16:11.525 --> 16:12.799
It's animated!

16:12.860 --> 16:14.203
Like that!

16:14.261 --> 16:14.966
I'll buy one, right?

16:15.029 --> 16:15.871
Come on!

16:15.929 --> 16:16.669
Seriously!

16:16.730 --> 16:18.038
I'll buy three.

16:18.098 --> 16:19.600
I keep telling Gina
when the money rolls in,

16:19.667 --> 16:21.510
she's gonna' wonder where
it's been all this time.

16:21.568 --> 16:22.979
When can I
start wondering?

16:23.037 --> 16:24.516
Next week, sister, when
we start selling

16:24.571 --> 16:25.982
a trillion watches.

16:26.040 --> 16:26.711
Really?

16:26.774 --> 16:27.411
That's right.

16:27.474 --> 16:28.782
Quit your goddamn job!

16:28.842 --> 16:30.150
Yeah, I'm
gonna' quit, okay?

16:30.210 --> 16:31.245
Sam says I can.

16:31.311 --> 16:32.813
Can do, sister!

16:32.880 --> 16:34.154
YOU can do it.

16:34.214 --> 16:35.249
Can Do.

16:35.315 --> 16:38.592
Can Do, the dog.

16:38.652 --> 16:42.429
What dog?

16:42.489 --> 16:44.992
Dog?

16:45.059 --> 16:49.405
We were selling
the dog watches.

16:49.463 --> 16:51.875
Am I missing something?

16:51.932 --> 16:53.879
Have you heard
Sam's dog shit theory?

16:55.283 --> 16:56.234
Look, what kind...

16:56.235 --> 16:57.447
We're eating, no one
wants to hear about it.

16:57.504 --> 16:58.482
No, no,
it's hilarious.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.849
They were at the dog
track last week...

17:00.908 --> 17:03.582
Hey,

17:03.644 --> 17:05.248
You were
at the dog track?

17:05.311 --> 17:06.518
Did you go?

17:06.579 --> 17:08.025
No, I went.

17:08.082 --> 17:09.253
You didn't go.

17:09.316 --> 17:13.162
I went with Bartender Carl,
and dominated, by the way.

17:13.220 --> 17:15.290
Salsa?

17:15.355 --> 17:20.896
It's delicious.

17:20.961 --> 17:24.772
G?

17:34.742 --> 17:36.619
That's great.

17:36.677 --> 17:37.781
I'm really
sorry, honey.

17:37.845 --> 17:39.153
No, it's my fault.

17:46.553 --> 17:49.557
Gina.

17:49.623 --> 17:53.264
How stupid can I be?

17:53.327 --> 17:58.299
I'm picking up extra trips to
pay down our credit cards,

17:58.365 --> 17:59.503
and you're here gambling.

17:59.566 --> 18:00.670
I know, I know.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.236
It isn't fair.

18:02.302 --> 18:06.808
Listen, we were just trying
to get more money

18:06.874 --> 18:07.944
so we could fund...

18:08.008 --> 18:09.214
If I hear that
excuse one more time,

18:09.276 --> 18:10.584
I'm gonna' scream.

18:10.644 --> 18:13.090
I'm gonna'
quit for good.

18:13.147 --> 18:15.127
You said
that two weeks ago,

18:15.182 --> 18:20.222
and a couple of months before
that, and a year before that.

18:20.287 --> 18:21.793
It's getting to be a joke.

18:30.097 --> 18:33.340
Gina, listen.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.778
The way we figure it, sixty
million people

18:35.836 --> 18:37.782
play the lottery.

18:37.838 --> 18:39.442
If I can sell one
percent, I mean,

18:39.506 --> 18:44.285
that is one out of a hundred,
that's sixty thousand watches!

18:44.344 --> 18:47.518
That's you taking
early retirement.

18:47.581 --> 18:49.288
That's a down
payment on our house.

18:49.349 --> 18:50.327
That's...

18:50.384 --> 18:53.331
I hope it's a
huge hit, I really do.

18:53.387 --> 18:58.359
But if you ever
gamble again...

19:17.841 --> 19:19.184
Don't blame Cinda, man.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.017
Blame me.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.182
I do blame you.

19:23.246 --> 19:25.055
I swore I told
her not to say anything.

19:25.115 --> 19:29.825
Yeah, just don't
worry about it, man.

19:29.886 --> 19:35.495
So was it a long ride
to the airport this morning?

19:35.558 --> 19:37.538
Yeah, the old
silent treatment

19:37.844 --> 19:39.824
I used to look forward
to those with Rhonda,

19:39.879 --> 19:40.721
actually instigate them.

19:40.780 --> 19:41.690
You think I talk a lot, man?

19:41.948 --> 19:43.000
Jesus..

19:45.118 --> 19:47.691
Gina giving you a hard time
about having to fly so much?

19:47.753 --> 19:49.733
I wouldn't
blame her if she did.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.235
Withholding sex yet?

19:52.291 --> 19:53.269
No.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.805
It's the only entertainment
we can afford.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.931
But you know what? That's
a good thing, buddy,

19:55.995 --> 19:57.338
because that's the
last thing to go.

19:57.396 --> 19:58.807
Oh Rhonda, towards the end
of that train wreck of a

19:58.865 --> 20:00.838
marriage, she'd
tell me, "Sam, no!

20:00.900 --> 20:01.704
I'm mid-month.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.541
I'm bloated.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.444
I don't want you
to look at me."

20:03.503 --> 20:04.038
I don't want to look at you!

20:04.103 --> 20:05.741
I want to fuck you!

20:05.805 --> 20:07.216
What a psycho, man.

20:07.273 --> 20:08.343
Right?

20:08.407 --> 20:09.784
Rhonda.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.753
Liar's Poker for the tab.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.655
Oh, well, can't very
well turn down free beer,

20:14.714 --> 20:15.818
can I?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.225
Hey, fuck you, man.

20:17.283 --> 20:18.819
Loser's first.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.761
Okay, I'll go anyway.

20:19.819 --> 20:23.926
Yeah.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.264
Three fours, my friend.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.268
Yeah?

20:26.325 --> 20:27.133
That's not going to do it.

20:27.193 --> 20:29.605
Four sixes.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.734
Oh, it's there, don't worry.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.004
Five sixes.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.174
Good God,
you're terrible!

20:35.175 --> 20:36.541
Keep it, keep it,
keep it!

20:36.571 --> 20:38.140
God, I don't like
this stupid game!

20:38.205 --> 20:39.081
Who made that up anyway?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.913
Hey, Carl!

20:40.973 --> 20:42.075
Two morons, Sammy.

20:42.142 --> 20:42.247
Yeah.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.486
The thing is, America
is the place where a little

20:48.548 --> 20:50.550
guy can have a big idea.

20:50.616 --> 20:53.495
Anybody can do it, come
up with bubble wrap,

20:53.553 --> 20:55.897
a super soaker,
a lottery watch.

20:55.955 --> 20:56.933
A million dollars

20:56.989 --> 20:58.832
You gotta' see in

20:58.891 --> 20:59.801
It's animated!

20:59.859 --> 21:01.896
One idea can
change everything.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.634
All it takes is one.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.300
Check it out.

21:05.364 --> 21:06.707
It's gonna' change every time.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.439
How do you feel about
winning some cash?

21:08.501 --> 21:09.377
I feel good about it.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.413
Let's do this, all right?

21:10.469 --> 21:11.038
Come on.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.480
All right.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.539
Check it out.

21:13.606 --> 21:17.452
Check out this
great new watch.

21:17.510 --> 21:18.887
Hey, how are
you doing, buddy?

21:18.945 --> 21:20.288
Lucky Lottery Watch, how
do you feel about it?

21:20.346 --> 21:20.915
No?

21:20.980 --> 21:22.186
Come on now.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.818
Hey, I know
you like the lottery.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.590
Check it out, a new way
to play the lottery!

21:25.651 --> 21:27.494
oh, yeah.

21:27.553 --> 21:28.395
More than two shakes,
you're playing with it.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.990
You know what I'm saying?

21:30.056 --> 21:31.126
I've got the
dress, I've got the smile.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.168
It's animated.

21:32.224 --> 21:32.793
I need a drink.

21:32.858 --> 21:33.563
It's animated.

21:33.626 --> 21:34.468
It's not working.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.268
Tell me about it.

21:37.629 --> 21:38.597
What is this, kid?

21:38.598 --> 21:39.833
What is this?

21:39.899 --> 21:41.401
Is this a Lab, or
is this a Retriever?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.343
That is a Lab.

21:42.401 --> 21:43.846
It's one of our best sellers.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.780
It's cute, very cute.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.943
Listen, who makes the business
decisions for this company?

21:48.007 --> 21:48.708
That would be me.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.349
Matt Reeder.

21:50.409 --> 21:51.114
Hey,
Matt, how are you?

21:51.177 --> 21:52.019
How can I help you?

21:52.078 --> 21:53.022
Oh, no, no.

21:53.079 --> 21:55.685
The question is,
how can I help you?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.091
See, my company is the leader

21:57.149 --> 21:59.095
in TV direct response
advertising.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.687
What we'd like to
do is stop by...

22:00.753 --> 22:02.198
We're not doing any
advertising right now.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.824
Wait, wait, wait.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.300
It's a whole new concept.

22:05.358 --> 22:06.393
We pay you.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.700
Okay, we're
really busy here, so...

22:08.761 --> 22:09.535
Listen, I
picked up a brochure,

22:09.595 --> 22:10.300
so I'll give you a call later.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.865
I'll explain what we do, okay?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.205
Come to the office
and we'll talk.

22:13.265 --> 22:16.405
We're really
not interested.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.541
You're not
interested in making money?

22:19.605 --> 22:22.245
Listen, I'll give you a call.

22:22.308 --> 22:24.652
I think you'll like what
I have to say, okay?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.020
Maybe I can get you
some customers, right?

22:27.079 --> 22:28.956
Huh?

22:29.015 --> 22:30.688
Customers are nice.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.094
Nice to see you.

22:33.152 --> 22:36.326
Fucking queer.

22:36.389 --> 22:39.598
Who's that asshole?

22:50.002 --> 22:52.039
You know, I mean, I
wouldn't call it a dud.

22:52.104 --> 22:53.777
I'd call it a start.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.342
Sam, use
some common sense.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.650
I mean, look, I'm as
disappointed as you are.

22:58.711 --> 23:01.089
That's fine.

23:01.147 --> 23:02.558
Hey, look, maybe that's
the problem, buddy.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.288
I don't know, maybe there's
just too much fucking common

23:04.350 --> 23:05.328
sense around here!

23:05.384 --> 23:07.364
Let's, I don't know,
shake it up a little bit!

23:07.420 --> 23:09.229
Let's think outside the box!

23:10.857 --> 23:11.857
OK.

23:13.192 --> 23:14.227
All right, I got it.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.271
Here's one.

23:15.327 --> 23:16.965
Get a little publicity.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.066
Find a lucky lottery winner,
and say we pay him a couple

23:19.131 --> 23:22.135
grand, I don't know, to say
that they got their numbers

23:22.201 --> 23:23.373
off of our watch.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.710
They go on TV.

23:24.770 --> 23:26.647
They say to the entire world,

23:26.706 --> 23:29.550
'I got the numbers off of this
watch'

23:29.608 --> 23:31.610
Sam, will you
listen to yourself.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.452
They just won the lottery.

23:33.512 --> 23:34.490
Why are they going to lie for
us for

23:34.547 --> 23:36.686
a couple of thousand bucks?

23:36.749 --> 23:38.092
I don't know, man.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.322
I'm just throwing
it out there.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.955
And that's assuming we have a
couple of thousand bucks.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.431
Yeah, we're
delinquent on everything,

23:42.488 --> 23:44.331
and withholding is right
around the corner.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.596
Okay, here we
go, small thinker.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.365
What?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.302
Underachiever.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.430
Okay, we gotta'
figure this out,

23:49.495 --> 23:51.406
unless you want to be
pounding nails again.

23:51.464 --> 23:52.670
All right, well, I'm the
only one coming up with some

23:52.732 --> 23:53.710
ideas.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.767
Anyone else want
to chime in here?

23:54.834 --> 23:56.074
Here's an idea.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.172
We could've done four or five
breeds of the dog watch for

23:58.237 --> 24:00.547
what we wasted at that expo!

24:00.606 --> 24:01.983
But we didn't,
did we, Bean?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.247
The highest re-order
rate of any product

24:03.309 --> 24:04.413
we've ever had, ever

24:04.477 --> 24:06.013
You know what, I want to
fucking choke you sometimes!

24:06.078 --> 24:07.216
Jesus!

24:07.279 --> 24:08.883
Goddammit, Bean, you're really
starting to piss me off!

24:08.948 --> 24:12.122
Hey, hey, you are
starting to piss me off, okay?

24:12.184 --> 24:14.790
Fuck!

24:14.854 --> 24:17.460
Come on, amigo.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.900
Hey, hey, hey, man.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.417
Come on, come on.

24:28.768 --> 24:33.183
Okay, let's go see
the bank manager.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.616
With Our
financial statement?

24:34.673 --> 24:36.277
Don't be ridiculous.

24:36.342 --> 24:37.980
No, we'll just go to him
without all the negative shit

24:38.043 --> 24:39.249
On it.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.518
I hope you're kidding,
because that's bank fraud!

24:41.580 --> 24:43.184
I can never tell
with you anymore.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.626
Yes, Bean,
he's kidding.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.924
Because
I won't sign it!

24:46.986 --> 24:48.897
Bean, he's kidding.

24:48.954 --> 24:49.839
Bean!

24:56.896 --> 24:59.001
Look, we're on
the same team, right?

24:59.064 --> 25:04.742
I need you, man.

25:04.804 --> 25:08.843
I say whatever it takes.

25:08.908 --> 25:12.048
I don't know what that is.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.130
Whatever it takes.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.995
Sam and I are
essentially out of business.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.125
I didn't know
it was that bad.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.466
I mean, we got enough
money for one maybe two

25:26.525 --> 25:29.335
payrolls, and that's it.

25:29.395 --> 25:31.432
You know, maybe
it's for the best.

25:31.497 --> 25:34.171
Go to work for Louisa, and get
away from Sam and his schemes

25:34.233 --> 25:36.645
before you end up in jail.

25:36.702 --> 25:38.409
I kind of like you, I
don't want you in jail.

25:38.470 --> 25:40.711
Well, you know, a
problem is

25:40.773 --> 25:42.411
an opportunity in disguise.

25:42.474 --> 25:46.752
I mean, every store who buys
the dog watch sells out.

25:46.812 --> 25:52.524
We just need more breeds.

25:53.052 --> 25:58.052
Could you get a loan
from your credit union?

26:03.863 --> 26:04.967
No, Mam

26:05.030 --> 26:06.099
No!

26:13.005 --> 26:14.985
Gina...

26:15.040 --> 26:15.575
No, Matt!

26:15.641 --> 26:17.143
No!

26:17.209 --> 26:18.415
I mean, how many failed
products have you had lately?

26:18.477 --> 26:20.286
That stupid jogger TV hat
I tried to talk you out of?

26:20.346 --> 26:23.418
Watch TV while you jog?

26:23.482 --> 26:26.361
The ten second toothbrush
for people in a hurry?

26:26.418 --> 26:27.226
Come on, Matt!

26:27.286 --> 26:28.287
Yeah, that was stupid

26:28.354 --> 26:29.526
but this is completely
different.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.623
It is night and day.

26:30.689 --> 26:34.193
Every store that bought
the dog watch sold out!

26:34.260 --> 26:36.797
I need more breeds
to get more accounts.

26:36.862 --> 26:40.105
Gina, this can work, trust me.

26:40.165 --> 26:43.339
This can work.

26:43.402 --> 26:45.814
Say it doesn't
sell for any reason.

26:45.871 --> 26:49.580
Would you promise to
go to work for Louisa?

26:49.642 --> 26:51.349
Look, it's
a proven product.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.514
We've sold these!

26:52.578 --> 26:55.024
Just answer
the question, Matt.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.993
Say it doesn't sell, would
you go to work for Louisa?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.495
Look, you ever hear
about what happens to pro

26:59.551 --> 27:01.428
athletes when they sign
their first contract?

27:01.487 --> 27:02.625
What's that got
to do with anything?

27:02.688 --> 27:05.222
Suddenly, here comes
the family with their hands out

27:05.223 --> 27:05.902
"Gimme, gimme".

27:05.958 --> 27:07.062
I mean, that's how I'm
going to feel

27:07.126 --> 27:08.605
working for your sister.

27:08.661 --> 27:11.665
Well,
you'd get over it!

27:12.972 --> 27:14.542
Al, I'm a
happily married woman.

27:14.607 --> 27:17.884
No, no, no.

27:17.943 --> 27:19.820
Just what I needed,
another success seminar

27:19.879 --> 27:22.291
with my in-laws.

27:22.348 --> 27:25.454
A guy in a bar told me once,
if you want to know what God

27:25.518 --> 27:29.557
thinks about money, look
at who he gives it to.

27:29.622 --> 27:31.295
Al, I love
you, you know that.

27:31.357 --> 27:32.461
I'd do anything for you.

27:32.825 --> 27:33.283
Absolutely.

27:33.593 --> 27:34.469
Matt, another beer?

27:34.527 --> 27:35.227
Okay, sure.

27:35.228 --> 27:36.799
But first, get
me that signature, Okay?

27:36.800 --> 27:37.861
Al, stop flirting with my wife.
We get guests.

27:37.862 --> 27:39.340
Get me that signature today.

27:39.397 --> 27:39.500
OK.

27:40.082 --> 27:40.474
Chao.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.276
Oh, God,
I need a drink.

27:42.634 --> 27:42.944
Now, now, now!

27:42.945 --> 27:43.269
Coming right up.

27:43.270 --> 27:43.746
I've got one ready.

27:44.070 --> 27:45.778
I'm so sorry
I'm so late.

27:45.838 --> 27:48.250
So sorry.

27:48.807 --> 27:50.013
Here you go, my love.

27:50.075 --> 27:53.215
Oh, thank you.

27:53.278 --> 27:55.519
What do you think?

27:55.581 --> 27:58.824
Thank you,
you wonderful man.

27:58.884 --> 27:59.274
Go get 'em.

27:59.275 --> 27:59.939
I'm good.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.497
I'm good.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.227
So, it's so
good to see you guys.

28:03.289 --> 28:04.290
You are good.

28:04.356 --> 28:05.334
So, Matt,
what do you want? Medium rare?

28:05.391 --> 28:06.062
Did you get
my message last week?

28:06.559 --> 28:08.095
I was in
Boise and Sacramento.

28:08.161 --> 28:10.368
Oh, world traveler.

28:10.429 --> 28:11.635
Well, guess what.

28:11.697 --> 28:14.871
The week before Christmas,
you two are coming with us

28:14.934 --> 28:15.776
to Telluride.

28:17.335 --> 28:18.137
Telluride.

28:18.203 --> 28:18.977
Yeah.

28:19.038 --> 28:20.039
We won the winning donation.

28:20.105 --> 28:21.982
At the Lupus
Charity Auction.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.486
Fourteen grand, huh?

28:23.542 --> 28:25.044
For a disease,
don't know

28:25.110 --> 28:26.646
what the hell it is.

28:26.712 --> 28:29.056
But it got us a four bedroom
condo right on the slopes

28:29.114 --> 28:30.286
for a week.

28:30.349 --> 28:32.727
Yeah, you ski right in,
ski right out your front door.

28:32.785 --> 28:36.892
We thought of you guys the
second we got it, huh?

28:36.955 --> 28:38.434
Well?

28:38.490 --> 28:40.527
There's no way we can
afford Telluride for a week.

28:40.592 --> 28:41.400
Oh, come on!

28:41.460 --> 28:42.495
It's all paid fort

28:42.561 --> 28:43.539
Yeah, but the
skiing, the restaurants...

28:43.595 --> 28:44.573
Oh!

28:44.630 --> 28:46.303
Live a little, have
some fun for a change.

28:46.365 --> 28:48.936
You guys have got to stop
worrying about money.

28:49.001 --> 28:50.947
So how's business?

28:51.003 --> 28:53.347
Could be better,
you know.

28:53.405 --> 28:55.248
I have an office and a
desk could have

28:55.307 --> 28:56.547
your name on it.

28:56.608 --> 28:57.882
I mean, anytime you
want, no pressure.

28:57.943 --> 29:00.924
There is a hot rock
massage that'll make you wet,

29:00.979 --> 29:02.481
and I don't mean sweat

29:02.548 --> 29:05.427
What do you think?

29:05.484 --> 29:07.327
Oh, seriously, Matt.

29:07.386 --> 29:09.366
Do you know what we
call real estate?

29:09.421 --> 29:12.800
Steal estate!

29:12.858 --> 29:16.237
Stop throwing
your money away on rent.

29:16.295 --> 29:18.366
Yeah, you can get my
little sister the casita

29:18.430 --> 29:24.176
she's always wanted.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.648
A little more wine?

29:26.705 --> 29:27.342
You too, hun?

29:27.406 --> 29:30.046
No, no, I'm good.

29:30.109 --> 29:31.452
Seven thousand,
that's amazing!

29:31.510 --> 29:35.117
Her credit union has a
formula based on her salary.

29:35.180 --> 29:36.818
Just be glad she got
the loan she did.

29:36.882 --> 29:39.761
But seven grand,
that's...no, that's amazing.

29:39.818 --> 29:41.491
Never mind, I should shut up.

29:41.553 --> 29:43.726
You know, it's three
more breeds, right?

29:43.789 --> 29:45.393
We have the Lab.

29:45.457 --> 29:46.800
We should do the Retriever,
the German Shepherd

29:46.859 --> 29:47.769
and the Beagle.

29:47.826 --> 29:49.169
It's better
than one Lab.

29:49.228 --> 29:50.468
But not really, man.

29:50.529 --> 29:52.372
I mean, everybody I talk to
wants the top ten or nothing,

29:52.431 --> 29:53.466
right?

29:53.532 --> 29:54.476
They don't want to piss
off the Boxer people,

29:54.533 --> 29:55.511
the Poodle people, blah, blah.

29:55.567 --> 29:56.011
I know.

29:56.068 --> 29:59.248
Look, just be
satisfied, all right?

30:00.104 --> 30:01.024
It's a good thing.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.218
You know
what we're good at?

30:09.281 --> 30:10.817
Lately not a whole lot.

30:10.883 --> 30:12.794
A little bit
of BJ my friend.

30:12.851 --> 30:14.262
Now, let's head to
that reservation.

30:14.319 --> 30:15.798
No, listen.

30:15.854 --> 30:16.730
Oh, come on,
you are a real asshole.

30:16.788 --> 30:17.823
No, listen to
me, listen to me.

30:17.890 --> 30:19.563
Okay, look, we want to
do 3 breeds, right?

30:19.625 --> 30:22.572
That's $1900 each,
that's $5700.

30:22.628 --> 30:25.165
We have $1300 left
to play with, right?

30:25.230 --> 30:26.573
Now, we hit a few
hands we have.

30:26.632 --> 30:27.702
What is this and this?

30:27.766 --> 30:30.178
That's a stack o' black, Okay?

30:30.235 --> 30:32.078
You pull that in, what
do we got here, cowboy?

30:32.137 --> 30:33.047
That's a nest egg!

30:33.105 --> 30:34.550
That's 12 grand!

30:34.606 --> 30:36.552
That's the top 10
breeds, my friend!

30:36.608 --> 30:40.055
That is the difference between
walking out of a store with an

30:40.112 --> 30:41.182
order for 10 dozen
instead of...

30:41.246 --> 30:42.350
3 dozen.

30:42.414 --> 30:43.984
But Gina, she gave us that
money, all of that money,

30:44.049 --> 30:45.323
for watches.

30:45.384 --> 30:47.295
Yes, but she would want
us to protect this investment,

30:47.352 --> 30:48.524
wouldn't she?

30:48.587 --> 30:49.725
Okay, look at it this way.

30:49.788 --> 30:51.392
We lose that $1300,
which we won't,

30:51.456 --> 30:52.526
because we dominate.

30:52.591 --> 30:53.797
Say we do.

30:53.859 --> 30:56.627
We still have the
$5700 left to do

30:56.628 --> 30:58.972
the top 3 breeds.

30:59.031 --> 31:00.408
We do dominate
at blackjack.

31:00.465 --> 31:05.778
Yes, We do.

31:05.837 --> 31:06.372
Lift Off.

31:06.438 --> 31:09.419
Yes, We can.

31:18.050 --> 31:23.056
Goddamn!

31:23.121 --> 31:24.964
Get my man some
French caviar, hun.

31:37.169 --> 31:37.738
Here we go again!

31:37.803 --> 31:38.577
I'm not afraid.

31:38.637 --> 31:42.380
I ain't afraid.

31:42.441 --> 31:43.647
8.

31:43.709 --> 31:45.313
We got to.

31:45.377 --> 31:48.256
Do the math!

31:48.313 --> 31:50.987
Oh, it's
gonna' be good.

31:51.049 --> 31:53.552
Do it again?

31:53.619 --> 31:54.563
Twenty-four thousand!

31:54.620 --> 31:58.158
Oh, do it again!

31:58.223 --> 32:00.396
Do it again!

32:00.459 --> 32:01.301
Put it all in, baby!

32:01.360 --> 32:02.236
We're all good!

32:02.294 --> 32:03.500
All right,
he's got a Six!

32:03.562 --> 32:06.975
Unbelievable!

32:31.323 --> 32:33.701
Seven thousand dollars.

32:33.759 --> 32:35.466
Dealer's sitting on
a 16, hits a 5?

32:35.527 --> 32:40.272
It's unbelievable!

32:43.335 --> 32:47.283
What happened?

32:47.339 --> 32:48.181
We out of gas?

32:48.240 --> 32:48.741
What?

32:48.807 --> 32:49.615
I can't go home.

32:49.675 --> 32:54.215
What?

32:54.279 --> 32:59.279
Not until
I figure this out.

33:07.426 --> 33:12.899
All right.

33:14.499 --> 33:16.501
Insurance fire.

33:16.568 --> 33:17.410
Insurance fire!

33:17.469 --> 33:19.380
Let's just torch
all of our watches.

33:19.438 --> 33:20.712
Is that so wrong?

33:20.772 --> 33:22.217
It's win-win!

33:22.274 --> 33:24.015
Newkin.

33:24.076 --> 33:24.816
New what?

33:24.876 --> 33:25.411
Who?

33:25.477 --> 33:26.455
Newkin.

33:26.511 --> 33:27.683
The guy, do you remember?

33:27.746 --> 33:30.226
The guy from the booth, said
he'd put the watches on TV

33:30.282 --> 33:31.920
and give us a percentage.

33:31.983 --> 33:33.223
Oh no, man.

33:33.285 --> 33:33.854
The knock-off king?

33:33.919 --> 33:34.795
No.

33:34.853 --> 33:36.093
What do you mean,
the knock-off king?

33:36.154 --> 33:37.758
Yeah, man, all the guys
in the next booth said that

33:37.823 --> 33:40.201
that guy lurches around
all the trade shows to rip

33:40.258 --> 33:41.532
people's ideas off.

33:41.593 --> 33:42.094
Forget in

33:42.160 --> 33:42.661
Fuck him!

33:42.728 --> 33:43.263
No.

33:43.328 --> 33:44.272
I doubt it.

33:44.329 --> 33:46.275
The guy runs a huge company.

33:46.331 --> 33:49.175
He's got ads on major
cable all the time.

33:49.234 --> 33:51.771
God, imagine how
many he could sell.

33:51.837 --> 33:53.817
Sixty-four million dog owners.

33:53.872 --> 33:55.874
Remember Bean's stat, 4 out
of 5 of them write their

33:55.941 --> 33:58.012
pet's names on greeting cards.

33:58.076 --> 33:59.851
Newkin can reach those people.

33:59.911 --> 34:00.912
You know what, buddy?

34:00.979 --> 34:02.151
That's the reason why we
should do it on our own,

34:02.214 --> 34:03.318
you know what I mean?

34:03.382 --> 34:04.861
Why turn it over to some
cheese dick and end up with

34:04.916 --> 34:06.361
nothing, man, and
get railroaded?

34:06.418 --> 34:10.025
No way!

34:10.088 --> 34:11.931
I don't trust a guy that
can eat his own fist, okay?

34:11.989 --> 34:12.797
Call me crazy!

34:12.858 --> 34:14.496
You see the chompers
on that guy?

34:14.559 --> 34:15.560
Come on, man.

34:15.627 --> 34:16.900
You want to do business
with him, seriously?

34:16.962 --> 34:18.771
I'd like to
do business, Sam.

34:18.830 --> 34:20.935
That's what I'd like IO do.

34:24.668 --> 34:25.976
You boys are old
enough to remember this.

34:26.036 --> 34:29.280
This is one of the all
time TV products.

34:29.341 --> 34:30.649
The chirping bird clock.

34:30.708 --> 34:33.246
How many of those
did you sell, if I can ask?

34:33.311 --> 34:34.346
Oh, Jesus.

34:34.413 --> 34:36.154
Mort?

34:36.214 --> 34:43.098
We sold... 781,260 clocks
in 105 days.

34:43.155 --> 34:46.500
But wait, there's more!

34:46.558 --> 34:48.094
I love those
commercials, the guy...

34:48.159 --> 34:49.467
Yeah, we're
very proud of that.

34:49.527 --> 34:51.303
Now, those numbers
are just a start,

34:51.362 --> 34:53.467
because once you create
interest in a product on TV

34:53.532 --> 34:56.478
then you go
for the after market.

34:56.534 --> 34:59.141
Retail.

34:59.204 --> 35:02.549
We're sitting at the adult table
with Sears and Wal-Mart.

35:02.607 --> 35:05.110
At the adult table,
Matthew, do you hear that?

35:05.177 --> 35:07.714
With Sears and Wal-Mart.

35:07.779 --> 35:09.122
if I may,

35:14.085 --> 35:16.463
You see, it's animated, so you
can actually see

35:16.521 --> 35:18.091
what dogs dream about.

35:23.895 --> 35:26.535
Millions of dog
lovers out there, Larry.

35:26.598 --> 35:29.135
Our customer,
too, older female.

35:29.201 --> 35:30.475
QVC?

35:30.535 --> 35:32.310
Come on, you get some has-been
celebrity on there with their

35:32.370 --> 35:34.179
pet Corgi or something.

35:34.239 --> 35:37.379
Could have a big upside.

35:37.442 --> 35:38.614
How many
breeds you got?

35:38.677 --> 35:40.054
Well, right now
it is just the one,

35:40.111 --> 35:43.991
but when we partner
with AmeriDirect,

35:44.049 --> 35:47.292
the American Kennel Club
top 20.

35:47.352 --> 35:49.059
All right.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.294
If we pick you up, we
fund all the TV ads.

35:52.357 --> 35:54.428
We handle inventory
management,

35:54.493 --> 35:55.767
retail distribution.

35:55.827 --> 35:56.771
All right.

35:56.828 --> 35:57.397
OK.

35:57.462 --> 35:58.907
So, question, yeah.

35:58.964 --> 36:00.409
What's our cut?

36:00.465 --> 36:04.003
If we pick you up,
an untested product,

36:04.069 --> 36:06.447
4%.

36:08.505 --> 36:09.952
How about a little
dinner before you fuck me?

36:10.008 --> 36:11.681
Wow!

36:11.743 --> 36:12.517
Amazing!

36:12.577 --> 36:13.647
Untested product?

36:13.712 --> 36:15.282
Do you know how many of
those watches we've sold?

36:15.347 --> 36:18.055
How many
have you sold on TV?

36:18.116 --> 36:19.896
Our volume is 50,

36:19.952 --> 36:22.393
100 times anything
you can possibly produce,

36:22.454 --> 36:24.592
especially with your
limited financial capability.

36:24.656 --> 36:25.532
Oh, really?

36:25.590 --> 36:26.591
And how do you know
anything about our

36:26.658 --> 36:27.898
limited financial capability?

36:27.959 --> 36:29.836
We vetted
International Gifts.

36:29.894 --> 36:30.464
What?

36:30.529 --> 36:31.239
What happened?

36:31.296 --> 36:31.756
We checked you out.

36:31.764 --> 36:33.367
What, I'm gonna' sit across
this table from two people I

36:33.431 --> 36:34.474
don't know shit about?

36:34.533 --> 36:35.538
What am I, stupid, huh?

36:35.600 --> 36:36.169
That's debatable.

36:36.234 --> 36:37.042
I don't know.

36:37.102 --> 36:38.604
Well, you
guys have no money.

36:38.670 --> 36:39.944
Why did you come
to see me, huh?

36:40.005 --> 36:41.780
Why are you sitting
in that chair, huh?

36:41.840 --> 36:42.716
You answer me that!

36:42.774 --> 36:43.775
You know, I...

36:43.842 --> 36:45.877
I what?
I...I...I what?

36:45.944 --> 36:47.048
Why did you come to see me?

36:47.112 --> 36:49.592
You tell him, tell
him why you came.

36:49.648 --> 36:52.288
Tell your little snot-nosed
friend why you came.

36:52.350 --> 36:54.626
Because I can move
your merchandise.

36:54.686 --> 36:56.131
Well, that's
because you're the king.

36:56.187 --> 36:57.427
I am the king.

36:57.489 --> 36:58.490
You are the
knock-off king!

36:58.557 --> 37:01.197
All right young man,
that's enough.

37:01.259 --> 37:03.205
That's all.

37:03.261 --> 37:04.740
Not smart.

37:04.796 --> 37:07.538
You boys are out
of your league.

37:10.101 --> 37:13.048
What a goddamn prick!

37:13.104 --> 37:13.878
You're the prick.

37:13.939 --> 37:14.417
Really?

37:14.472 --> 37:14.680
Yeah.

37:14.740 --> 37:15.311
I'm the prick?

37:15.374 --> 37:16.246
Yes.

37:16.309 --> 37:17.287
Come on!

37:17.843 --> 37:19.117
We're not going to
bend over for this guy.

37:19.177 --> 37:23.182
We're gonna' do
it our own way.

37:23.248 --> 37:26.559
I'm fucked.

37:38.678 --> 37:42.023
You gave me your word.

37:42.081 --> 37:46.120
That money was going
to buy watches.

37:46.185 --> 37:47.357
It was.

37:47.420 --> 37:50.993
We... we just...
um... Gina,

37:52.638 --> 37:54.427
I've been trying to
figure out a way to...

38:10.643 --> 38:16.992
Gina.

38:26.225 --> 38:28.603
When I get
back from this trip,

38:28.661 --> 38:33.235
I'm moving into
Louisa's guest house.

38:33.299 --> 38:36.872
I'm gonna' use
one of her cars.

38:36.936 --> 38:41.385
You can have the Chevy
to drive to work.

38:41.440 --> 38:42.748
Gina, I...

38:42.808 --> 38:44.253
Or drive it
to a car lot

38:44.310 --> 38:46.984
and sell it for
gambling money.

38:47.046 --> 38:51.119
I don't care.

38:51.183 --> 38:54.926
I'm thinking about
myself for a change.

38:54.987 --> 38:57.369
Like you do all the time.

39:04.229 --> 39:05.145
Gina...

39:08.846 --> 39:10.269
...can we just talk about it?

39:10.270 --> 39:11.610
No. Don't touch me.

39:15.507 --> 39:17.112
Gina?

39:45.637 --> 39:46.780
What's going on, amigo?

40:01.687 --> 40:04.668
This is sexy, it
doesn't look like you.

40:04.723 --> 40:06.703
You've got some
very cute clothes.

40:06.758 --> 40:07.759
I've never seen these before.

40:07.826 --> 40:09.635
You should let me help
you make some outfits.

40:09.695 --> 40:11.265
I could spruce it up a bit.

40:11.330 --> 40:12.274
I like them.

40:12.331 --> 40:14.140
And you sleep on these, okay?

40:14.199 --> 40:17.009
These are for decor only.

40:42.461 --> 40:49.242
How did it
ever come to this?

40:49.301 --> 40:51.247
Unbelievable.

40:58.443 --> 41:00.719
Did she call you back yet?

41:00.779 --> 41:02.816
No.

41:02.881 --> 41:06.973
I... I really did it this time.

41:08.954 --> 41:10.558
I'm gonna' share
something with you

41:10.622 --> 41:13.068
that I learned
a long time ago.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.833
Women?

41:15.894 --> 41:17.638
They can't stay mad.

41:20.198 --> 41:24.544
They are emotionally
resilient creatures, man.

41:24.603 --> 41:26.947
Impressive.

41:27.005 --> 41:29.144
They're all fucking crazy!

41:29.207 --> 41:30.277
But they're resilient.

41:30.342 --> 41:34.119
She'll be back
before you know it.

41:34.179 --> 41:39.060
You know, buddy, it's not
like you got caught cheating.

41:39.117 --> 41:40.289
You know what I mean?

41:40.352 --> 41:43.264
That's a whole other 12 miles
of bad road and STDs.

41:43.321 --> 41:43.595
You know what I mean?

41:43.655 --> 41:45.862
But you can...
you can lie.

41:45.924 --> 41:48.302
You can forget
anniversaries.

41:48.360 --> 41:50.897
You can get drunk, show your
ass in front of the in-laws.

41:50.962 --> 41:53.306
That's all...they'll
forgive all that shit, man.

41:53.365 --> 41:57.745
But do not, you can not
get caught cheating.

41:57.803 --> 42:00.306
Bro, they don't like it.

42:00.372 --> 42:02.648
It'll fuck you every
time, trust me.

42:02.708 --> 42:06.656
So in about probably
26...27 days,

42:06.712 --> 42:07.452
Gina will be back.

42:07.512 --> 42:08.149
You want to bet on it?

42:08.213 --> 42:10.386
I'll bet you on it.

42:13.351 --> 42:17.390
Well, you guys have
been really great to work for.

42:17.456 --> 42:18.434
Bren.

42:18.490 --> 42:19.491
Oh, Bren.

42:19.558 --> 42:20.662
You've been
really great as well.

42:20.726 --> 42:23.832
I'm so sorry.

42:23.895 --> 42:24.703
No.

42:24.763 --> 42:26.299
Yes, great.

42:26.364 --> 42:31.177
So, what are
you guys going to do now?

43:13.645 --> 43:15.022
Well, listen,
think of the alternative.

43:15.080 --> 43:16.286
I mean, look at my ex-husband.

43:16.348 --> 43:20.125
Forty-seven years old, he's
got the dick of a teenager.

43:20.185 --> 43:25.328
At least Matt's faithful,
you got that going for you.

43:25.390 --> 43:26.767
I like you and Matt
together, you know?

43:26.825 --> 43:28.498
Please.

43:28.560 --> 43:29.231
No, stop.

43:29.294 --> 43:32.605
I've had it.

43:32.664 --> 43:34.666
Has he always gambled?

43:34.733 --> 43:36.007
Oh, please.

43:36.067 --> 43:38.513
I met him on a Reno
turn, remember?

43:38.570 --> 43:40.481
Oh, yeah, yeah,
you told me that.

43:40.539 --> 43:42.951
Did I tell you that he
and Sam flipped a coin to see

43:43.008 --> 43:44.487
who would ask me out?

43:44.543 --> 43:49.014
No, I don't
remember that.

43:49.080 --> 43:50.286
I should have run the
other way

43:50.348 --> 43:55.320
as soon as i heard that.

43:55.387 --> 43:58.766
I really should have.

44:19.311 --> 44:20.915
>> Attention dog lovers!

44:20.979 --> 44:26.327
>> Now you can show your love for
your dog with the amazing...

44:26.384 --> 44:27.658
>> ...from AmeriDirect.

44:27.719 --> 44:29.426
>> I always wondered
what he was thinking!

44:29.487 --> 44:31.194
>> Using breakthrough technology,

44:31.256 --> 44:33.759

44:34.926 --> 44:38.100

a fire hydrant!

44:38.101 --> 44:39.496
Fuck me!

44:39.497 --> 44:40.307
>> Where can I get one?

44:40.766 --> 44:42.236
>> Uh, I got to have one.

44:44.803 --> 44:47.340
>> Only $19.95,
The Dreaming Dog Watch...

44:47.405 --> 44:49.908
I'm coming
around the bend.

44:49.975 --> 44:52.148
Who's flexible?

44:52.210 --> 44:53.314
Who's a dancer?

44:53.378 --> 44:53.947
Come on!

44:54.012 --> 44:54.956
Yeah, that's me.

44:55.013 --> 44:56.356
Yeah, you like
that, don't you?

44:56.414 --> 44:57.449
It's me, pick up.

44:57.515 --> 44:57.993
Goddamn in

44:58.049 --> 44:59.289
Fuck! Hold on.

44:59.351 --> 45:00.796
Pick up!

45:00.852 --> 45:01.330
Please!

45:01.386 --> 45:02.057
Sam!

45:02.120 --> 45:02.689
It's Matt. It's Matt.

45:02.754 --> 45:03.630
Yo, what's LIP, buddy?

45:03.688 --> 45:04.496
Turn on channel 28.

45:04.556 --> 45:05.830
What?

45:05.891 --> 45:09.532
I'm really kind
of busy right now.

45:09.594 --> 45:12.074
Goddamn it, turn on
channel 28!

45:12.130 --> 45:13.268
Fuck, give
me the remote!

45:13.331 --> 45:13.900
What?

45:13.965 --> 45:15.273
The remote!

45:15.333 --> 45:16.209
I'm so close!

45:16.268 --> 45:17.246
Okay, hang on, hang on!

45:17.302 --> 45:17.837
I got it.

45:17.903 --> 45:18.506
Jesus!

45:18.570 --> 45:19.207
Hold on, okay.

45:19.271 --> 45:21.251
OK.

45:21.306 --> 45:23.217
Jesus, you sound hysterical!

45:23.275 --> 45:24.447
>> Only $19.95.

45:24.509 --> 45:28.012
>> The Dreaming Dog Watches

45:28.078 --> 45:29.684

>> That's 1-800-555-DOGS.
- Fucking rich... You...

45:45.729 --> 45:47.673
>> Call now!
- You there?

45:47.933 --> 45:49.429
So did you
have Mr. Newkin sign

45:49.430 --> 45:50.727
a non-disclosure agreement?

45:50.965 --> 45:52.342
No, we didn't.

45:52.400 --> 45:55.074
You didn't?

45:55.136 --> 45:56.240
Well, that's not essential.

45:56.304 --> 45:59.114
By copying your
design exactly,

45:59.174 --> 46:02.587
Mr. Newkin has exhibited
malice of forethought.

46:02.644 --> 46:03.918
What? What does that mean?

46:03.979 --> 46:07.256
Oh, sorry.
You have a case.

46:07.315 --> 46:08.726
Hot damn.

46:08.783 --> 46:09.921
I told you, man.

46:09.985 --> 46:11.020
Great.

46:11.086 --> 46:12.622
How far are you willing
to go on this matter?

46:12.687 --> 46:14.325
Like a virgin
on prom night, baby!

46:14.389 --> 46:15.299
All the way!

46:15.357 --> 46:16.261
Let's do this!

46:16.324 --> 46:17.559
Sam, I don't think

46:17.626 --> 46:20.266
that's the question
he's asking.

46:20.328 --> 46:23.241
Would you be prepared to take
this on a contingency basis?

46:23.932 --> 46:26.344
No.
I couldn't do that.

46:26.401 --> 46:27.937
But you said
we had a case.

46:27.970 --> 46:30.477
Yeah, but this type
of case can be protracted.

46:30.538 --> 46:32.115
It can go on
for a long time.

46:32.173 --> 46:38.317
But I might consider going
with a contingent contingency.

46:38.380 --> 46:38.983
Good, I want in

46:39.047 --> 46:39.457
I'm in!

46:39.514 --> 46:40.458
What is it?

46:40.515 --> 46:42.620
Contingent
contingency.

46:42.684 --> 46:43.719
I'll write them a letter

46:43.785 --> 46:45.560
If they respond
with a good offer,

46:45.620 --> 46:48.226
I'll take it on contingency.

46:50.325 --> 46:52.498
And I say to the guy,
I say, "Sir, I'm sorry,

46:52.560 --> 46:56.030
but we do not have mints
or gum on this plane."

46:56.097 --> 46:58.771
And he gives me this big
exasperated sigh, he says,

46:58.833 --> 47:01.541
"Do you mean to tell me you do
not have one goddamn mint on

47:01.603 --> 47:03.605
this entire plane?"

47:03.672 --> 47:04.548
Smoker.

47:04.606 --> 47:05.516
Yeah, definitely.

47:05.573 --> 47:07.348
And a jerk.

47:07.409 --> 47:09.548
So Gina, come
outwith us

47:09.611 --> 47:11.249
when we get to Portland.

47:11.313 --> 47:12.451
No, thanks, Randall.

47:12.514 --> 47:14.824
I'm just gonna'
order room service

47:14.883 --> 47:17.693
and take a long hot bath.

47:17.752 --> 47:18.958
I know what
you're going through.

47:19.020 --> 47:20.624
It's not easy.

47:20.689 --> 47:21.667
Tell you what.

47:21.723 --> 47:23.498
I'll bring up a really
good bottle of wine,

47:23.558 --> 47:26.334
and give you a massage.

47:26.394 --> 47:28.237
Have you ever had
a Shiatsu before?

47:28.296 --> 47:32.506
I mean like deep
tissue, just really...

47:32.567 --> 47:33.841
emotions just float out.

47:33.902 --> 47:36.075
The first time I ever
had one, I cried.

47:36.137 --> 47:36.945
Thanks.

47:37.005 --> 47:38.507
Yeah, it's
good, it lets it out

47:38.573 --> 47:39.608
Have you ever had one?

47:39.674 --> 47:40.550
No, Randall.

47:40.608 --> 47:43.020
Sit back.

47:43.078 --> 47:45.149
Just trying to help.

47:54.055 --> 47:55.864
Poor girl.

47:59.527 --> 48:02.064
A cowboy
philosopher once told me,

48:02.130 --> 48:06.272
"If you find yourself in
a hole, stop digging."

48:13.975 --> 48:15.750
This is bullshit.

48:15.810 --> 48:17.619
I know about
these things, bro.

48:17.679 --> 48:19.488
They turn you into
feeling like a

48:19.547 --> 48:21.493
fucking plucked chicken.

48:21.549 --> 48:23.085
I didn't
ask you to some.

48:23.151 --> 48:24.789
Okay, guys,
let's get started.

48:24.853 --> 48:26.161
If you're going to
be a dick, just leave now.

48:26.221 --> 48:30.135
I'm just saying,
it's not even legitimate.

48:32.727 --> 48:36.334
Hey, good crowd.

48:36.398 --> 48:38.207
It's all fucking
propaganda if you ask me.

48:38.266 --> 48:40.303
We're all here
for the same reason.

48:40.368 --> 48:43.144
Our lives have gone
out of control.

48:43.204 --> 48:49.052
We all wanted to be big
shots, be rich, powerful,

48:49.110 --> 48:50.680
but without the effort.

48:50.745 --> 48:52.725
A something for nothing
approach to life.

48:52.781 --> 48:56.729
Sounds good to me.

48:56.785 --> 49:00.494
My name is Kelly, and
I'm a compulsive gambler.

49:00.555 --> 49:03.627
Hi, Kelly.

49:04.459 --> 49:05.836
My name is Glenda,

49:05.894 --> 49:07.874
and I'm a compulsive gambler.

49:07.929 --> 49:13.902
Hi, Glenda.

49:13.968 --> 49:17.814
My name is Matt, and
I have a gambling problem.

49:17.872 --> 49:22.844
Hi, Matt.

49:42.530 --> 49:43.668
Hi, it's me,
Louisa.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.802
I signed you up for the real
estate exam next month.

49:45.867 --> 49:50.475
I hope you're
serious about this.

49:51.406 --> 49:53.079
Hey-

49:53.141 --> 49:58.352
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm sending you a check

49:58.413 --> 50:01.485
for the payment to
your credit union.

50:01.549 --> 50:06.549
And, well, when you feel
like talking...I'll see you.

50:37.752 --> 50:40.926
I kept telling myself
something Edison said:

50:40.989 --> 50:42.666
"A lot of people don't realize

50:42.667 --> 50:44.223
how close they are to success

50:44.224 --> 50:47.805
when they give up."

51:06.314 --> 51:09.852
The combo, man.

51:09.918 --> 51:11.226
The shooter.

51:15.089 --> 51:20.004
So did Newkin's lawyer
end up saying forget it?

51:20.061 --> 51:20.507
Yeah.

51:22.564 --> 51:23.338
Essentially.

51:23.398 --> 51:25.571
I mean, it starts out the way
they always do,

51:25.633 --> 51:28.880
"Thank you so much for bringing
this to our attention, but..."

51:28.936 --> 51:29.637
Go fuck yourself, right?

51:29.704 --> 51:31.843
Exactly.

51:31.906 --> 51:33.886
Say good night, Sammy.

51:33.942 --> 51:35.512
Good shot, man.

51:42.817 --> 51:44.548
You sell any
LA-Z-BOYS lately?

51:47.956 --> 51:51.462
I am in danger of
being employee of the month.

51:52.527 --> 51:55.371
That's good.

51:55.430 --> 51:58.172
Well, I'm asshole of the day.

51:58.232 --> 51:59.870
I think I could get
used to working there,

51:59.934 --> 52:03.746
and then wake up suddenly
20 years from now...

52:03.805 --> 52:05.375
Oh, please stop
talking about it,

52:05.440 --> 52:07.032
that scares the
shit out of me.

52:10.711 --> 52:13.351
Am I gonna' end
up some pathetic,

52:13.414 --> 52:17.658
lonely sixty-year-old framer?

52:21.722 --> 52:22.632
Hey, guys.

52:22.690 --> 52:25.227
Like another one?

52:25.293 --> 52:26.328
Can't hurt.

52:26.394 --> 52:28.874
Okay.

52:28.930 --> 52:32.844
Ice cold ones coming up.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.244
Oh, yeah.

52:35.303 --> 52:36.577
It's time for a beer.

52:36.637 --> 52:37.767
Thank you, man.

52:45.046 --> 52:46.650
I'm gonna' go
drop the kids off.

52:55.990 --> 52:57.628
"Oh yeah...

52:57.692 --> 52:59.694
...time for a beer."

53:16.010 --> 53:17.011
Yes.

53:17.078 --> 53:20.719
Hold on, Mr. Chow,
it's coming in right now.

53:23.284 --> 53:25.025
OK.

53:25.086 --> 53:25.689
Right.

53:25.753 --> 53:27.289
No battery compartment.

53:27.355 --> 53:28.561
That's gonna' be a
problem.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.329
We need room for
the circuit board.

53:30.391 --> 53:31.631
Well, it is too bulky.

53:31.692 --> 53:33.501
Yeah, I know
it looks bad, but...

53:33.561 --> 53:35.131
Yeah, well, get
your engineers on it,

53:35.196 --> 53:37.608
see if you can, I don't know,
reduce the circuit board.

53:37.665 --> 53:39.667
We'll try.
I'll send you a fax.

53:39.734 --> 53:41.213
Okay. Tonight, yeah?

53:41.268 --> 53:42.212
We'll try.

53:42.269 --> 53:44.215
Excellent. And no buttons.

54:02.656 --> 54:03.691
Oh yeah!

54:03.758 --> 54:05.203
Time for a beer!

54:15.282 --> 54:18.820
Hey!

54:19.720 --> 54:20.994
Where's the fire?

54:21.054 --> 54:21.794
You all right?

54:21.855 --> 54:23.994
Yeah, I'm great.

54:24.057 --> 54:25.229
Jesus, man!

54:25.292 --> 54:26.202
Let me ask
you a question.

54:26.259 --> 54:26.933
Yeah?

54:26.994 --> 54:29.533
We, together, have run
our business into the ground,

54:29.596 --> 54:32.543
my wife left me, we're
working shit jobs,

54:32.599 --> 54:34.943
we're completely broke, and
we're approaching middle age.

54:35.002 --> 54:38.006
It's reason to be depressed,
wouldn't you think?

54:38.071 --> 54:39.709
Do I look depressed?

54:39.773 --> 54:40.444
I don't know.

54:40.507 --> 54:42.180
Look! Do I look depressed?

54:42.242 --> 54:43.448
Is this a trick question?

54:43.510 --> 54:45.421
Bro, we've been
friends for twenty years.

54:45.479 --> 54:47.117
We've been through
a lot of shit.

54:47.181 --> 54:49.889
But I'm telling you, man, we
are on the verge

54:49.950 --> 54:53.625
of living the dream!

54:53.687 --> 54:54.688
All right, look.

54:54.755 --> 54:57.668
Sammy's here, everything's
gonna' be okay.

54:57.724 --> 54:58.327
Hugs?

54:58.392 --> 54:58.927
You need hugs?

54:58.992 --> 54:59.936
Come on, it's Okay.

54:59.993 --> 55:00.562
No, you know,
I don't need a hug.

55:00.627 --> 55:01.105
You know what I do need?

55:01.161 --> 55:01.764
What's that?

55:01.828 --> 55:02.898
I need a beer.

55:02.963 --> 55:03.634
I like beer.

55:03.697 --> 55:04.801
Do you like beer?

55:04.865 --> 55:05.639
Let's have a beer.

55:05.699 --> 55:06.302
Why don't you
get us some beer.

55:06.366 --> 55:06.810
OK.

55:06.867 --> 55:07.470
All right.

55:07.534 --> 55:08.137
I'll get you a beer.

55:08.202 --> 55:09.840
All right.

55:10.237 --> 55:13.411
You're
acting weird, man.

55:14.841 --> 55:16.616
Unbelievable.

55:19.646 --> 55:21.626
Oh, is there not
an opener over there?

55:21.682 --> 55:22.626
That's too bad.

55:22.683 --> 55:25.323
I flaked.

55:25.385 --> 55:28.025
Hey, why
don't you try this.

55:28.088 --> 55:29.590
You sure you're
all right, man?

55:29.656 --> 55:31.567
You seem crazy.

55:31.625 --> 55:34.504
I feel like I should be
concerned about you.

55:34.561 --> 55:36.802
>> Oh, yes! I like beer!

55:38.303 --> 55:39.747
That is hysterical.

55:40.734 --> 55:43.511
>> Oh, yes! I like beer!

55:44.571 --> 55:46.448
Wait a minute.

55:49.243 --> 55:51.655
Where'd you get this?

55:51.712 --> 55:55.751
Where do you think?

55:55.816 --> 55:57.659
You son a bitch.

55:57.718 --> 55:58.526
How much?

55:58.585 --> 56:01.361
$6.95 retail.

56:01.421 --> 56:02.627
Well, it
sounds amazing, man!

56:02.689 --> 56:03.394
It's an
automatic sound.

56:03.457 --> 56:04.527
There's no buttons.

56:04.591 --> 56:05.399
But the best thing
about it is it surprises you!

56:05.459 --> 56:06.529
It's a total surprise!

56:06.593 --> 56:07.435
What's the minimum?

56:07.494 --> 56:08.404
Five thousand units.

56:08.462 --> 56:10.032
Oh, shit.

56:10.097 --> 56:10.973
I can sell that in a week!

56:11.031 --> 56:12.374
Bro, this is it!

56:12.432 --> 56:13.433
This is the one!

56:13.500 --> 56:14.979
This is a chain store product!

56:15.035 --> 56:17.777
This goes everywhere, man!

56:17.838 --> 56:19.749
Jesus Christ!

56:19.806 --> 56:20.841
And hey, you know what?

56:20.907 --> 56:22.909
this
little thing right here,

56:22.976 --> 56:24.478
this is gonna' get
you Gina back, man.

56:24.544 --> 56:25.579
Maybe.

56:25.646 --> 56:26.522
If I can repay her.

56:26.580 --> 56:27.898
Oh, I promise you that.

56:28.415 --> 56:30.190
We gotta' get this out before
Newkin prick-ass

56:30.250 --> 56:31.354
gets a hold of it, right?

56:31.818 --> 56:33.126
Oh, Newkin's not
gonna' find out about this!

56:33.186 --> 56:35.166
We introduce it at
the L.A. Gift Expo.

56:35.221 --> 56:36.822
- L.A. Gift Show, right, right!
- You know what I mean?

56:36.823 --> 56:37.665
We'll kill Newkin!

56:37.724 --> 56:38.828
And hey, look at me!

56:38.892 --> 56:40.530
I'm gonna' get the money
for this, somehow some way!

56:40.594 --> 56:42.938
I just spent the rent
money on this prototype.

56:42.996 --> 56:43.997
Yeah, well, I got it.

56:44.064 --> 56:45.805
I don't care
where, I'll get it.

56:45.866 --> 56:48.039
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

56:48.101 --> 56:48.636
Oh, yes!

56:48.702 --> 56:51.444
I like beer!

57:17.998 --> 57:18.806
Hey-

57:18.865 --> 57:22.938
How are you?

57:23.003 --> 57:25.279
You look great.

57:25.338 --> 57:26.840
You, too.

57:26.907 --> 57:27.942
How are you, Sam?

57:28.008 --> 57:29.180
What's going on?

57:29.242 --> 57:34.555
Well, I'm...summer
time, right?

57:34.614 --> 57:38.790
Pounding nails in the desert,
that sucks man.

57:38.852 --> 57:40.388
Something to drink?

57:40.453 --> 57:44.595
Just water, please.

57:44.658 --> 57:48.970
So, did
you talk to Matt?

57:49.029 --> 57:50.474
You know, he's
doing all right.

57:50.530 --> 57:54.740
He's doing his thing.

57:54.801 --> 57:58.271
But my idea man is reduced to
selling furniture

57:58.338 --> 58:01.512
in a strip mall.

58:01.575 --> 58:05.785
Sam, is that
why you called,

58:05.845 --> 58:10.624
to tell me you're
worried about Matt?

58:10.684 --> 58:14.996
Well, look, I
know he fucked up, okay?

58:15.055 --> 58:17.763
But don't we all,
right, you, me?

58:17.824 --> 58:20.532
I mean, you should just be
happy that Matt won that coin

58:20.594 --> 58:23.097
toss instead of me, because
I am the train wreck.

58:23.163 --> 58:26.872
I am the fuck up, right?

58:26.933 --> 58:29.004
I mean, you should just call
him, and say,

58:29.069 --> 58:32.073
"Hey, Matt, how are you doing?"

58:32.138 --> 58:33.310
And he'd say,
"Oh, Gina, you know,

58:33.373 --> 58:36.980
I've been doing a
little bit Of this,

58:37.043 --> 58:39.080
a little bit of that."

58:44.384 --> 58:48.264
Try it.

58:49.689 --> 58:54.570
Oh yes! I like beer!

58:54.628 --> 58:55.868
Did Matt
come up with this?

58:55.929 --> 58:56.839
Yeah.

58:56.896 --> 58:58.000
How's he do it?

58:58.064 --> 58:59.236
Oh, you
know, it's simple.

58:59.299 --> 59:01.176
I think it has to do with like
the metal and the...yeah,

59:01.234 --> 59:02.872
I have no idea.

59:02.936 --> 59:09.061
But ur, Gina, this...
is the one, telling you.

59:12.045 --> 59:17.927
So we've been talking
to some investors and...

59:17.984 --> 59:20.589
I just thought maybe
your sister Louisa

59:20.653 --> 59:22.012
might be interested.

59:24.891 --> 59:26.866
Matt ask you...?

59:26.926 --> 59:29.839
No, he hasn't.
He doesn't know I'm here.

59:29.896 --> 59:32.706
Was this his idea?

59:32.766 --> 59:35.178
No, that would be mine.

59:35.235 --> 59:40.048
Yeah, you know, call me crazy,
but she likes to make money.

59:40.106 --> 59:41.449
She wouldn't
touch this, Sam.

59:41.508 --> 59:42.452
No?

59:42.509 --> 59:46.514
No. Trust me. Listen,
I got to get going.

59:46.579 --> 59:49.321
I've got an early check-in and
I haven't packed yet, so...

59:49.382 --> 59:50.417
All right.

59:50.483 --> 59:51.359
I got it, I got it.

59:51.418 --> 59:51.896
I got it.

59:51.951 --> 59:53.988
It's fine.

59:54.054 --> 59:55.727
We've got a
big show coming up,

59:55.789 --> 59:58.201
so...normally I would
never ask this, you know.

59:58.258 --> 59:59.703
I'd never...it's just
that, you know...

59:59.759 --> 01:00:01.204
Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam!

01:00:01.261 --> 01:00:02.103
She wouldn't do it.

01:00:02.162 --> 01:00:02.867
No?

01:00:02.929 --> 01:00:03.532
Take care, man.

01:00:03.596 --> 01:00:03.972
All right.

01:00:04.031 --> 01:00:06.101
Hey, come on, give
me a hug at least!

01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:14.148
Good to see you.

01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:17.086
You look gorgeous.

01:00:18.278 --> 01:00:19.450
I loved Sam
like a brother,

01:00:19.512 --> 01:00:21.856
but he drives me crazy.

01:00:21.915 --> 01:00:24.156
You never knew what he was
going to say or do next.

01:00:24.217 --> 01:00:26.163
There wasn't a thought that
entered his head that didn't

01:00:26.219 --> 01:00:28.358
come straight
out of his mouth.

01:00:28.421 --> 01:00:31.595
He acts on every scheme, and
to hell with the consequences.

01:00:32.892 --> 01:00:34.303
What the fuck?

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:37.068
This is how we
get Gina's money back.

01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:38.302
Sam, is it drugs?

01:00:38.364 --> 01:00:39.502
Yes, it's drugs.

01:00:39.566 --> 01:00:40.636
No, it's not fucking drugs.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:44.341
How stupid do you think I am?

01:00:44.404 --> 01:00:46.816
All right, this is it.

01:00:46.873 --> 01:00:48.750
OK.

01:00:50.343 --> 01:00:52.414
You know, every once in a
while an opportunity

01:00:52.479 --> 01:00:54.618
presents itself
right under our nose.

01:00:54.681 --> 01:00:57.059
We just have to reach
out there and grab them!

01:00:57.117 --> 01:00:58.027
You're acting
weird, brother.

01:00:58.084 --> 01:00:59.358
No, don't
worry about that.

01:00:59.419 --> 01:01:01.729
The bartender Carl,
he's got this buddy, J.J.

01:01:01.788 --> 01:01:04.792
Now, J.J., he's been going out
to the desert and he's been

01:01:04.858 --> 01:01:10.331
making an absolute
fortune swiping saguaros.

01:01:10.396 --> 01:01:12.774
Okay, we're getting our
seed money

01:01:12.832 --> 01:01:14.470
from committing a felony.

01:01:14.534 --> 01:01:15.444
It's a felony!

01:01:15.502 --> 01:01:16.708
No, no, not really, man.

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:18.113
You see, because
he's got a permit,

01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:20.583
and he goes and gets prickly
pears and the barrel cactuses,

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.677
and he swipes, you know,
a few saguaros, man.

01:01:22.742 --> 01:01:24.483
Now, these things go for
eight hundred dollars a foot,

01:01:24.544 --> 01:01:26.080
and then these arms,
these go for four hundred.

01:01:26.146 --> 01:01:27.716
$0 this is like
ten, twenty grand!

01:01:27.781 --> 01:01:29.761
It's like
two, three tons!

01:01:29.816 --> 01:01:32.922
What do you think
you're doing?

01:01:32.986 --> 01:01:34.863
Okay, where did
you get all this?

01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:38.869
Here's a shovel.

01:01:38.925 --> 01:01:40.927
Look at the
size of that thing!

01:01:40.994 --> 01:01:43.065
Let's do this.

01:01:43.129 --> 01:01:44.631
A four
hundred-year-old plant

01:01:44.697 --> 01:01:45.641
you're going to chop down?

01:01:45.698 --> 01:01:46.574
That no one's
gonna' miss, buddy.

01:01:46.633 --> 01:01:49.170
Fifty yards off
the goddamn I-191

01:01:49.235 --> 01:01:50.646
Come on, let's
get out of here.

01:01:50.703 --> 01:01:52.546
The Border Patrol is
gonna' be by, seriously.

01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:55.984
Come on, I
need your help!

01:01:56.042 --> 01:01:57.817
Fuck!

01:01:57.877 --> 01:01:58.582
Look at yourself!

01:01:58.645 --> 01:01:59.555
You're a cactus thief!

01:01:59.612 --> 01:02:00.920
You're a fucking cactus thief!

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:02.118
Hello?

01:02:02.182 --> 01:02:05.959
Grab your fucking
shovel and help me dig, man!

01:02:06.019 --> 01:02:06.997
Come on, man.

01:02:07.053 --> 01:02:08.498
We're desperate, we're
not this desperate!

01:02:08.555 --> 01:02:10.364
Come on, man!

01:02:10.423 --> 01:02:12.061
Just calm
down for a second.

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:13.934
Come on, bastard!

01:02:13.993 --> 01:02:15.495
Come on!

01:02:15.562 --> 01:02:20.562
Fuck!

01:02:26.406 --> 01:02:27.384
This is it, man.

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.510
I mean, I got nothing.

01:02:28.575 --> 01:02:31.215
You know that's not true.

01:02:31.277 --> 01:02:34.190
Come on, we've been worse.

01:02:34.247 --> 01:02:36.557
Somethings gonna'...we're
gonna' figure this out, man,

01:02:36.616 --> 01:02:41.565
and it ain't gonna'
be with this cactus.

01:02:41.621 --> 01:02:44.067
All right.

01:02:47.227 --> 01:02:49.400
There you go.

01:02:56.175 --> 01:02:57.017
That's nuts!

01:02:57.076 --> 01:02:58.578
It's nuts!

01:02:58.644 --> 01:03:00.920
And you just reached in there
and all of a sudden there was

01:03:00.980 --> 01:03:02.084
this talking...

01:03:02.148 --> 01:03:04.754
Beer opener.

01:03:04.817 --> 01:03:05.887
I want to show Tom.

01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:06.622
No, no, I'm gonna' show...

01:03:06.685 --> 01:03:07.720
No, Rita,
it's a secret!

01:03:07.786 --> 01:03:08.730
A secret!

01:03:08.787 --> 01:03:11.734
Tom, check it out.

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.167
What is it?

01:03:13.225 --> 01:03:15.068
Oh,
yes! I like beer!

01:03:15.127 --> 01:03:18.267
How cool is that?

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.968
Hey, I have got
to get one of these.

01:03:20.032 --> 01:03:21.238
Where can I get one?

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.439
I've got an Air Force buddy
who would just flip for this.

01:03:23.502 --> 01:03:27.507
Yeah my... my husband
invented it, so...

01:03:27.573 --> 01:03:29.610
I thought you
two were separated?

01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:32.178
We are.

01:03:33.412 --> 01:03:35.915
I think people grow up
with an idea about what their

01:03:35.981 --> 01:03:39.428
life is going to be, and it's
hard to break out of that.

01:03:39.485 --> 01:03:43.934
All it takes is
a little faith.

01:03:43.989 --> 01:03:47.459
It's like when the Wizard
gave the Scarecrow a diploma.

01:03:47.526 --> 01:03:50.564
It completely changed the
Scarecrow's idea of himself,

01:03:50.629 --> 01:03:54.543
and he was able to do things
he never thought he could do.

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.409
Your last flight.

01:03:56.968 --> 01:03:57.344
Jealous.

01:03:57.403 --> 01:04:00.407
It's a little scary.

01:04:00.472 --> 01:04:02.713
You think you're
gonna' like real estate?

01:04:02.775 --> 01:04:07.224
Well, if I can get past
the paperwork,

01:04:07.279 --> 01:04:10.282
and Louisa being
a control freak.

01:04:10.348 --> 01:04:11.418
Oh, yeah.

01:04:11.483 --> 01:04:13.719
You know it. You're gonna'
be pretty good at it.

01:04:13.785 --> 01:04:19.001
I mean, people warm up to you.

01:04:19.058 --> 01:04:21.095
I'm going to miss
buddy-bidding with you, Rita.

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:23.060
Don't start. No.

01:04:25.764 --> 01:04:27.300
Come down to
scheduling with me.

01:04:27.366 --> 01:04:29.437
I want to check
on my trip trade.

01:04:32.271 --> 01:04:36.413
Surprise!

01:04:48.354 --> 01:04:50.425
Mike!

01:04:50.489 --> 01:04:52.025
Bridget!

01:04:52.091 --> 01:04:53.803
Good luck.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:45.010
And we were
just going to talk.

01:05:45.077 --> 01:05:50.077
Well, I'm so
glad to have you back.

01:06:00.693 --> 01:06:03.441
I'm not
ready to come back.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.571
Well, you
could've fooled me.

01:06:10.636 --> 01:06:12.946
I mean, what's...

01:06:13.005 --> 01:06:15.315
I know it doesn't
make sense, but...

01:06:30.389 --> 01:06:34.428
Could you call Sam and
see what he's doing tonight?

01:06:34.493 --> 01:06:40.375
There's something I'd like
to go over with you guys.

01:06:40.432 --> 01:06:41.911
You came up with it.

01:06:41.967 --> 01:06:43.503
I might say it, but
you said it too, once.

01:06:43.569 --> 01:06:44.839
You would say it again
and again and again

01:06:44.903 --> 01:06:46.546
with each product,
"This is the one..."

01:06:46.605 --> 01:06:47.901
Yes. Okay, maybe.

01:06:47.902 --> 01:06:48.339
Maybe.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.341
Yes. See?

01:06:49.408 --> 01:06:51.513
See anyway, who cares?
What's the point, right?

01:06:51.543 --> 01:06:55.355
The point is that I think
this is the one

01:06:55.414 --> 01:06:59.692
you guys have been
waiting on.

01:07:00.252 --> 01:07:00.890
Really?

01:07:00.953 --> 01:07:02.830
I showed it around
our union meeting last week,

01:07:02.888 --> 01:07:07.337
and everybody,
everybody wanted one.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:10.469
You show it
to your sister?

01:07:10.529 --> 01:07:11.507
I did.

01:07:11.563 --> 01:07:12.064
Yeah?

01:07:12.131 --> 01:07:13.269
And?

01:07:13.332 --> 01:07:15.744
She said no.

01:07:15.801 --> 01:07:19.044
God!

01:07:19.104 --> 01:07:21.445
And she's gonna' freak
when she finds out

01:07:21.506 --> 01:07:25.480
what I've done,
but let her.

01:07:26.044 --> 01:07:30.550
I'm going to pay for
the opening order.

01:07:30.615 --> 01:07:33.118
That's your
retirement money.

01:07:33.184 --> 01:07:35.562
I know, Matt, but I think
this is an opportunity.

01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:37.293
Listen, Gina,
it's really...

01:07:37.355 --> 01:07:38.766
Whoa, whoa, will
you shut up for a second?

01:07:38.823 --> 01:07:40.666
Can't you see what she's
really trying to do here?

01:07:40.725 --> 01:07:42.136
I mean, I can see it.

01:07:42.193 --> 01:07:43.968
She's trying to get a
fresh start for you guys.

01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:45.064
That's what it is, right?

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:47.201
Sam, this is business.

01:07:47.265 --> 01:07:48.642
Oh.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:49.337
Well, who cares?

01:07:49.401 --> 01:07:50.379
I don't care.

01:07:50.435 --> 01:07:51.311
Cut it.

01:07:51.369 --> 01:07:52.109
I'm in!

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:52.910
Thank you.

01:07:52.971 --> 01:07:55.508
Don't thank me yet.

01:07:55.573 --> 01:08:00.573
So, the opening order,
plus $6400 additional

01:08:07.085 --> 01:08:11.556
to pay Bean what you
owe him, and rehire him.

01:08:11.623 --> 01:08:13.159
And he controls the checkbook.

01:08:13.224 --> 01:08:13.998
Yes.

01:08:14.059 --> 01:08:15.663
Of course.

01:08:15.727 --> 01:08:16.671
Yeah, it's fine by me.

01:08:16.728 --> 01:08:18.036
Okay.

01:08:18.095 --> 01:08:19.073
The other thing is...

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.700
And?

01:08:20.765 --> 01:08:26.044
I want one-third
of the profits.

01:08:27.973 --> 01:08:30.475
The early-out bonus isn't
enough for a house,

01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:36.720
and I'm not sure I'm
cut out for real estate.

01:08:36.781 --> 01:08:37.885
Yeah.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:41.260
That's fine with me.

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:43.424
A third?

01:08:43.488 --> 01:08:45.764
Jesus!

01:08:45.823 --> 01:08:48.430
What happens if you
guys get back together?

01:08:48.493 --> 01:08:49.095
That's two-thirds!

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.435
I'm getting railroaded!

01:08:51.496 --> 01:08:52.770
Still a third.

01:08:52.831 --> 01:08:54.606
Okay, Gina.

01:08:54.666 --> 01:08:55.770
You're shrewd, all right.

01:08:55.834 --> 01:08:57.711
OK.

01:08:57.769 --> 01:09:00.750
I'm thinking of a number here,
I'm gonna' throw it out there.

01:09:00.805 --> 01:09:04.377
40-40-20.
How about it?

01:09:04.442 --> 01:09:05.511
A third.

01:09:05.577 --> 01:09:08.649
Think about it.
25. How about it?

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:09.987
Look at me. It's a good deal.

01:09:10.048 --> 01:09:12.323
A third.

01:09:12.384 --> 01:09:15.524
Thirty-three point
three, three, three.

01:09:15.587 --> 01:09:16.258
All right, fuck it!

01:09:16.321 --> 01:09:16.957
Who cares, man?

01:09:17.022 --> 01:09:18.296
Let's do this!

01:09:18.356 --> 01:09:20.426
There's enough money to
go around for all of us!

01:09:20.492 --> 01:09:21.493
What the hell am I thinking?

01:09:21.559 --> 01:09:22.332
Amen.

01:09:22.394 --> 01:09:23.395
Right?

01:09:23.461 --> 01:09:24.872
I mean, this is amazing!

01:09:24.929 --> 01:09:27.000
I love you guys!

01:09:27.064 --> 01:09:30.046
Okay, Dave, let
me set the scene for you.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:30.805
All right.

01:09:30.868 --> 01:09:32.542
You just
got home from work.

01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:34.207
You're heading in the house,
and you head straight for the

01:09:34.272 --> 01:09:36.548
refrigerator, open
the door, and...

01:09:36.608 --> 01:09:38.679
Oh yeah!

01:09:38.743 --> 01:09:41.656
Time for a beer!

01:09:41.712 --> 01:09:44.990
This time...the only
reason you go to work in the

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:47.689
morning is to get to this
moment with the beer at night.

01:09:47.752 --> 01:09:49.287
Yeah, baby.

01:09:49.354 --> 01:09:50.162
Oh yeah!

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.167
Time for a beer!

01:09:52.223 --> 01:09:53.327
That's it. That's good.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.098
That's it.

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:55.695
Cool.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.295
You're amazing.

01:09:56.361 --> 01:09:57.738
Thank you.

01:09:57.796 --> 01:10:00.709
Maybe try it with a
chuckle on the 'Oh, yeah!'

01:10:00.765 --> 01:10:02.301
Okay, sure.

01:10:02.367 --> 01:10:03.641
Take two,
Talking Beer Opener?

01:10:03.701 --> 01:10:04.479
- Yep.
- Yep.

01:10:05.170 --> 01:10:08.174
Oh yeah!
Time for a beer!

01:10:10.809 --> 01:10:14.154
Yeah!

01:10:46.177 --> 01:10:47.121
Hello?

01:10:47.178 --> 01:10:49.055
Hi, it's me.

01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:49.956
Hey-

01:10:50.014 --> 01:10:50.890
Any word
on the container?

01:10:50.949 --> 01:10:53.361
Yeah, they're
still stuck in customs.

01:10:53.418 --> 01:10:55.625
I'll call the steamship
company tomorrow.

01:10:55.687 --> 01:10:58.190
I don't imagine it'll be
more than a couple of days.

01:10:58.256 --> 01:11:01.965
Also, this flyer should
go out tonight, so...

01:11:02.026 --> 01:11:03.596
It's really
all happening.

01:11:03.661 --> 01:11:05.436
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:10.707
Listen, I've got to go.

01:11:10.768 --> 01:11:12.042
Louisa's here, so..

01:11:12.103 --> 01:11:16.483
All right, bye.

01:11:16.541 --> 01:11:17.246
Matt?

01:11:17.308 --> 01:11:18.218
Uh-huh.

01:11:18.276 --> 01:11:18.811
Well?

01:11:18.877 --> 01:11:19.947
Well what?

01:11:20.011 --> 01:11:22.287
Did you do what I said and
ask for your money back?

01:11:22.347 --> 01:11:24.657
Louisa,
you don't listen!

01:11:24.716 --> 01:11:26.423
I told you,
it's a done deal.

01:11:26.484 --> 01:11:28.095
The container is
in Long Beach.

01:11:28.152 --> 01:11:30.220
Next week, we're
introducing the opener

01:11:30.221 --> 01:11:31.628
at the L.A. Gift Expo.

01:11:31.689 --> 01:11:33.100
Uh, you're so naive.

01:11:33.158 --> 01:11:34.330
What do you know
about business?

01:11:34.392 --> 01:11:36.736
What did you know about
real estate when you started?

01:11:36.794 --> 01:11:37.966
You're blind!

01:11:38.029 --> 01:11:40.839
You've been with him eight
years, and what do you have?

01:11:40.899 --> 01:11:43.038
You're going to end
UP With nothing!

01:11:43.101 --> 01:11:45.513
No house, no job, no money!

01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:46.742
Nothing!

01:11:50.675 --> 01:11:53.417
This is my decision. Not Matt's,
not yours. Mine.

01:11:58.616 --> 01:11:59.924
Stubborn!

01:12:13.264 --> 01:12:16.006
This is gonna' bring us some
serious FU money, you guys.

01:12:16.067 --> 01:12:17.410
You're damn right.

01:12:17.468 --> 01:12:19.106
What's FU money?

01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:20.547
Fuck-you money.

01:12:20.605 --> 01:12:22.107
Wouldn't that be FY?

01:12:22.173 --> 01:12:23.915
FY, Bean.

01:12:24.976 --> 01:12:25.920
Who needs a hug?

01:12:25.977 --> 01:12:32.223
Come here.

01:12:32.283 --> 01:12:33.489
Yeah!

01:12:33.551 --> 01:12:35.588
One hundred and
eighty-four cartons.

01:12:35.653 --> 01:12:36.996
Five thousand openers.

01:12:37.055 --> 01:12:38.125
Woo-hoo!!

01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:40.999
Hey, guys, what's
a Talking Beer Opener?

01:12:41.059 --> 01:12:46.133
Allow my
assistant to demonstrate.

01:12:46.197 --> 01:12:49.303
International Gifts
presents.

01:12:49.367 --> 01:12:50.505
What's it say?

01:12:50.568 --> 01:12:55.017
The Talking Beer Opener.

01:12:55.073 --> 01:12:56.416
>> Oh yeah!

01:12:56.474 --> 01:12:58.097
>> Time for a beer!

01:13:00.645 --> 01:13:01.783
Oh, that's pretty good!

01:13:01.846 --> 01:13:03.553
I've never seen
that before, man!

01:13:03.615 --> 01:13:06.789
But why didn't you guys use a
man's voice like,

01:13:06.851 --> 01:13:09.832
"Oh yeah!
Time for a beer!"

01:13:09.887 --> 01:13:10.365
Yeah, really?

01:13:10.421 --> 01:13:11.491
Really??

01:13:11.556 --> 01:13:13.058
>> Oh yeah!

01:13:13.124 --> 01:13:14.102
>> Time for a beer!

01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:14.693
Shit!

01:13:14.759 --> 01:13:16.500
Checking them!

01:13:16.561 --> 01:13:17.699
Damn it!

01:13:20.732 --> 01:13:22.010
Check them! Check them!

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:23.879
Check them!

01:13:27.973 --> 01:13:29.513
Alvin and the
fucking Chipmunks!

01:13:29.574 --> 01:13:33.078
Can't catch a break!

01:13:33.144 --> 01:13:34.145
No, I tested them all.

01:13:34.212 --> 01:13:35.452
They're all bad!

01:13:35.513 --> 01:13:36.583
Listen to it!

01:13:36.648 --> 01:13:37.558
>> Oh yeah!

01:13:37.615 --> 01:13:38.252
>> Time for a beer!

01:13:38.316 --> 01:13:39.454
Okay?

01:13:39.517 --> 01:13:41.497
So I mean, what are we gonna'
do about this, Mr. Chow?

01:13:41.552 --> 01:13:43.361
Well, you send the
defective ones back,

01:13:43.421 --> 01:13:44.866
we'll check them out,
see what the problem is.

01:13:44.922 --> 01:13:46.060
No, no, absolutely not.

01:13:46.124 --> 01:13:47.797
You fix the problem
right now!

01:13:47.859 --> 01:13:50.232
I need samples and stock
available right away

01:13:50.294 --> 01:13:51.471
for the L.A. Gift Expo!

01:13:51.529 --> 01:13:52.098
Let me talk to him.

01:13:52.163 --> 01:13:52.766
Shut up!

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:53.535
Absolutely not!

01:13:53.598 --> 01:13:56.272
You got to
get over there.

01:13:56.334 --> 01:13:58.746
I can get you a pass.

01:14:25.425 --> 01:14:28.065
Well, let's see what
the problem is.

01:14:28.128 --> 01:14:30.505
>> Oh yeah!
>> Time for a beer!

01:14:30.563 --> 01:14:32.201
We can put a
gold resistor here,

01:14:32.264 --> 01:14:34.141
stabilize the recording rate.

01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:36.874
Yes.

01:14:36.936 --> 01:14:38.711
Put in a bigger speaker,
right?

01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:39.977
Make it louder.

01:14:40.039 --> 01:14:41.177
Great, great.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:45.848
How quickly can we get,
say, 10 dozen?

01:14:45.911 --> 01:14:47.891
Well, we can work hard.

01:14:47.947 --> 01:14:49.153
Have it by tomorrow morning.

01:14:49.215 --> 01:14:50.592
Huh, great!

01:14:55.321 --> 01:14:57.597
Quality control,
sound testing,

01:14:57.657 --> 01:15:00.200
100%.
No more problems.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:03.335
That's excellent, Mr. Chow.

01:15:03.395 --> 01:15:05.630
We... we're going to need
the rest of the order shipped

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:08.271
air freight at your expense,
so we can have openers in the store

01:15:08.334 --> 01:15:09.938
right after the Expo.

01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:12.175
The customer always
pays for the shipping.

01:15:12.238 --> 01:15:17.586
Yes, but this was
your fault, Mr. Chow.

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:19.987
Well, maybe
some air freight.

01:15:20.046 --> 01:15:21.923
We share the cost, yes?

01:15:21.981 --> 01:15:23.892
I'll tell you, the
sooner my customers get these,

01:15:23.949 --> 01:15:25.895
the sooner you get a reorder.

01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:29.956
...Tsing-Tao!

01:15:30.022 --> 01:15:31.365
What are they saying?

01:15:31.424 --> 01:15:33.461
Uh, yes!
"Time for Tsing-Tao!"

01:15:33.526 --> 01:15:34.937
China's most popular beer.

01:15:34.994 --> 01:15:37.497
I see.

01:16:32.618 --> 01:16:34.154
What time is it?

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:38.999
10 minutes to noon.

01:16:39.058 --> 01:16:41.937
You ready?

01:16:41.994 --> 01:16:46.500
This is it, here we go.

01:16:47.633 --> 01:16:49.112
It's like
the guy said once,

01:16:49.168 --> 01:16:50.841
"Everything that's loose in
this country

01:16:50.903 --> 01:16:53.383
eventually rolls to L.A.

01:16:53.439 --> 01:16:55.180
And they were all there.

01:16:55.241 --> 01:16:58.654
From the Mom and Pop
stores to the big chains.

01:16:58.711 --> 01:17:01.055
This is the biggest
trade show of the year."

01:17:01.313 --> 01:17:03.691
Would you like to see
a talking beer opener?

01:17:03.749 --> 01:17:06.753
That's right,
check it out right here.

01:17:06.819 --> 01:17:08.799
Talk to her, she'll
make it happen, right here.

01:17:08.854 --> 01:17:09.423
That's right.

01:17:09.488 --> 01:17:10.228
Come on over.

01:17:10.289 --> 01:17:10.733
Hey, guys.

01:17:10.789 --> 01:17:11.790
Check it out.

01:17:19.498 --> 01:17:21.671
Happy Hour
just got happier!

01:17:21.734 --> 01:17:24.010
Let me talk to you about the
sexiest openers...

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:25.548
Excuse
me, can I buy a sample?

01:17:25.604 --> 01:17:27.948
My husband is a
talking beer opener.

01:17:28.007 --> 01:17:29.111
Hi.

01:17:29.174 --> 01:17:29.652
Toys For Men.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:30.846
Escondido.

01:17:30.909 --> 01:17:32.286
Oh, yeah, that's
near San Diego, yeah?

01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:32.947
Yeah, right.

01:17:33.012 --> 01:17:34.685
Three stores, actually.

01:17:34.747 --> 01:17:36.727
And let me tell you, it's so
hard to find gifts for men.

01:17:36.782 --> 01:17:38.013
You walk this show,
any show,

01:17:38.014 --> 01:17:39.885
it's women's gifts,
women's gifts.

01:17:39.886 --> 01:17:41.126
And then finally I
stumble on you guys.

01:17:41.187 --> 01:17:45.602
You know, I'll take...
what's 3 times 72?

01:17:46.658 --> 01:17:47.762
216.

01:17:48.326 --> 01:17:50.397
Yeah, 216.

01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:52.533
You can write it up.

01:17:52.598 --> 01:17:54.942
These are great.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:55.705
Love it.

01:17:55.768 --> 01:17:57.076
All right, thank you.

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:21.738
Jesus, Larry,
look what's going on!

01:18:21.794 --> 01:18:22.844
Are those
the two schmucks

01:18:22.845 --> 01:18:24.430
that came to our office?

01:18:24.496 --> 01:18:25.201
Yeah.

01:18:25.264 --> 01:18:27.301
Guaranteed one show wonders.

01:18:27.366 --> 01:18:28.538
My, my, my-

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.273
They're getting quite a crowd.

01:18:30.335 --> 01:18:33.282
Yeah, but it's
not a product for TV.

01:18:33.338 --> 01:18:35.746
Too cheap, $7 retail?

01:18:35.908 --> 01:18:37.746
Got to be
$19.95 for TV.

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:40.086
That's the magic price.

01:18:40.145 --> 01:18:43.126
If it's not on TV,
who gives a shit, right?

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:44.718
Hey, Newkin!

01:18:44.783 --> 01:18:46.160
How 'bout you, man?

01:18:46.218 --> 01:18:48.323
How 'bout you?

01:18:48.387 --> 01:18:51.891
what an asshole.

01:19:02.968 --> 01:19:05.881
Bye now.

01:19:05.938 --> 01:19:06.516
What was that?

01:19:06.572 --> 01:19:08.576
Repartee,
a gift store in Portland,

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.881
ordered at the show,
showed the flyer to a customer,

01:19:10.943 --> 01:19:13.010
who just ordered 250

01:19:13.011 --> 01:19:14.987
for a wedding reception.

01:19:20.053 --> 01:19:21.663
That's exciting, isn't it?

01:19:21.721 --> 01:19:22.999
You know,
we've got this going,

01:19:23.055 --> 01:19:23.790
but now we got
to keep it going.

01:19:24.356 --> 01:19:26.199
I was thinking we got to
diversify the brands,

01:19:26.258 --> 01:19:27.396
come up with new ideas.

01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:29.302
I was thinking, I don't know,
maybe The Three Stooges?

01:19:29.361 --> 01:19:30.169
I love Curly.

01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:31.640
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

01:19:32.197 --> 01:19:34.974
What about,
"Mmmm, beer."

01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:37.275
Homer.

01:19:37.336 --> 01:19:39.407
"Mmmm, beer!"

01:19:47.473 --> 01:19:49.121
"Oh Yes"
"Woo-hoo!"

01:19:49.281 --> 01:19:50.282
Matt, Craig's on two!

01:19:50.349 --> 01:19:53.956
Tell him we've just moved in,
we need 3 more phone lines.

01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:55.760
What about that stuff
going to Australia?

01:19:55.821 --> 01:19:57.494
How about that
order going to Australia?

01:19:57.556 --> 01:20:00.127
Brenda, hold my calls!

01:20:01.759 --> 01:20:02.133
>> Yes!

01:20:02.194 --> 01:20:03.138
>> Oh, yes!

01:20:03.195 --> 01:20:04.503
>> Woo-hoo!

01:20:04.504 --> 01:20:07.601
(In Spanish) >> ...Homer Simpson!
(CER-VEZA ... beer)

01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:12.706
(In Japanese)
>> ...Homer Simpson...!

01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:16.810
(In Norwegian)
>> ...Homer Simpson!

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:19.151
Take two,
Talking Beer Opener.

01:20:19.211 --> 01:20:20.315
A beer, sir?
(Cerveza, senor?)

01:20:20.379 --> 01:20:22.359
Yes, Corona!
(Si, Corona!)

01:20:22.414 --> 01:20:25.020
Oh, you speak Spanish.
(Oh, habla Espanol.)

01:20:25.083 --> 01:20:27.529
Yes, Corona!
(Si, Corona.)

01:20:27.586 --> 01:20:29.156
Nice!
(Bueno!)

01:20:34.493 --> 01:20:36.029
Yeah!

01:20:40.299 --> 01:20:42.336
I'm really
happy for Gina.

01:20:42.401 --> 01:20:45.007
She finally got that
casita she always wanted,

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:48.574
bought it all by herself.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.244
Sam gave her a plaque to put
over the door

01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:52.949
that said "Casa de Homer".

01:20:53.011 --> 01:20:55.150
Her sister Louisa
was horrified.

01:20:55.214 --> 01:20:56.192
Hi, Sam.

01:20:56.248 --> 01:20:57.022
Hey, Sam.

01:20:57.082 --> 01:20:58.356
How are you doing?

01:21:27.481 --> 01:21:28.118
Hey-

01:21:28.181 --> 01:21:29.285
All right, guys.

01:21:29.349 --> 01:21:33.092
Gina, to making your new
house a home, sister!

01:21:33.153 --> 01:21:34.632
Here here!

01:22:05.217 --> 01:22:06.339
Hi.

01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:09.365
The place looks great.

01:22:09.421 --> 01:22:11.560
Thanks.

01:22:11.623 --> 01:22:14.020
Yeah, a guy could
get used to living here.

01:22:15.861 --> 01:22:18.098
I don't know, Matt.

01:22:18.163 --> 01:22:19.540
I don't

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:35.155
Gina, seriously.

01:22:38.216 --> 01:22:42.562
Okay, I got an idea.

01:22:42.621 --> 01:22:45.158
You got a flashlight?

01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:31.039
I'm not crazy, am I?

01:23:31.103 --> 01:23:32.912
"I know he's a little off.

01:23:32.971 --> 01:23:35.042
Yes, but that's why
you liked him right now.

01:23:35.107 --> 01:23:38.850
That's what I always
love about him."

01:23:47.452 --> 01:23:51.491
Yes.
