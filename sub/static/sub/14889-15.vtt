‐Oh.

Why does your company
want 500 acres on Mypos?

11:21.114 --> 11:24.250
Audits indicate that our debt
ratio is highly underleveraged

11:24.284 --> 11:26.787
and in order to avoid
certain tax liabilities

11:26.820 --> 11:29.723
we need to invest capital before
the end of our fiscal year.

11:29.756 --> 11:32.358
Ha ha ha, I know
the problem well.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.796
Now, we’re prepared to pay
a very fair price

11:35.829 --> 11:36.997
for the land in question.

of the total purchase price.

of the island‐‐

11:49.409 --> 11:51.978
We get money?

can say "sold."

Balki, what more
do you need to know?

13:51.131 --> 13:52.365
Worldwide Amalgamated is one

13:52.398 --> 13:54.400
of the nicest
multinational corporations

13:54.434 --> 13:56.436
in the Fortune 500.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.371
Yeah, we read the annual reports

13:58.404 --> 14:01.608
the press releases, the cover
story in Time magazine.

14:01.642 --> 14:03.610
I got this microfilm.

14:03.644 --> 14:05.078
But reading the tiny print

14:05.111 --> 14:06.913
is giving me a headache.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.617
Alright.
Balki, let’s focus here.

14:11.484 --> 14:15.155
Now, could $28 million

14:15.188 --> 14:19.025
improve the lives
of the people on Mypos?

14:19.059 --> 14:20.326
‐Yes.
‐Yes?

14:20.360 --> 14:23.463
Yes. We could,
we could build better roads.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.998
Better roads.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.267
‐New schools.
‐New schools!

14:27.300 --> 14:30.070
And there has been talk of,
of building a football stadium

14:30.103 --> 14:32.038
and luring the Raiders over.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.376
Well, Balki.
This is your chance.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.611
Mypos will have the Raiders!

14:37.644 --> 14:40.514
The Raiderettes!
The silver and black!

14:40.547 --> 14:43.383
You mean,
Bo knows sheepherding?

14:46.119 --> 14:47.654
Yes.

14:47.688 --> 14:49.089
Yes, he does.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.694
So, in the morning
you’ll accept this offer

14:53.727 --> 14:55.896
and we’ll get
expensive haircuts.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.499
Oh, cousin,
I wish I could say yes!

14:59.533 --> 15:01.134
‐You can.
‐I can?

15:01.167 --> 15:02.468
Yes, you can.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.107
‐No, I can’t.
‐Why not?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.442
Because I don’t know why
Worldwide wants to buy the land.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.512
Balki, they told you why
they want to buy the land.

15:11.545 --> 15:13.046
They’ve got a tax problem.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.715
In fact, if you’d say yes

15:14.748 --> 15:16.449
we would have one problem.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.685
A big, beautiful,
kiss it on the mouth

15:18.719 --> 15:21.688
$2.8 million tax problem.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.325
[knocking on door]

15:25.358 --> 15:29.295
Cousin, I want you
to calm down.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.364
You’re getting
a greed‐high again.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.234
[knocking on door]

15:36.169 --> 15:38.104
Why is this so hard?

15:40.006 --> 15:41.642
Balk‐eye Bartookamouse?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.512
I’m Balk‐eye.

15:45.546 --> 15:47.447
Could you please sign...

15:47.480 --> 15:50.183
Uh, take this pen
and sign your name.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.372
It’s from Worldwide.

16:12.405 --> 16:16.276
"Dear, Mr. Bartokomous,
effective immediately

16:16.309 --> 16:22.315
"Worldwide Amalgamated withdraws
its offer of $28 million.

16:22.348 --> 16:25.686
"Further evaluation
of the land in question

16:25.719 --> 16:28.121
makes it prudent..."

16:28.154 --> 16:31.692
Balki. I’m going
to the window now.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.563
If you need me,
I’ll be on the pavement.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.766
Take a sweater.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.571
(Balki)
’"So effective immediately’

16:44.605 --> 16:49.175
we are raising our offer
to $35 million."

16:51.645 --> 16:55.281
$35 million?

16:55.315 --> 16:58.051
Balki, you are a genius.

17:02.488 --> 17:04.625
You held out and squeezed

17:04.657 --> 17:07.127
another $7 million
out of them.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.194
Do you think it would be
too much if we hired a butler?

17:11.832 --> 17:14.200
It seems like this is an offer
I can’t refuse.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.403
You can’t refuse? You can’t
refuse? He can’t refuse!

17:17.436 --> 17:19.039
What are you going to do
with your share of the money?

17:20.272 --> 17:21.473
I give it to the poor.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.643
Good. They’ll be taken care of.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.778
I can spend my share on myself.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.264
Mr. Bartokomous
is 20 minutes late.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.332
If he doesn’t get here soon
to sign those papers

17:46.366 --> 17:47.701
I’m afraid our deal is off.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.169
Oh, don’t worry.
He’ll be here any minute.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.171
He’s very hot for this deal.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.440
What do you think
of the new Mercedes?

17:56.442 --> 17:59.546
Balki, where have you been?

17:59.580 --> 18:01.748
Mr. Bartokomous,
we were getting worried.

18:01.782 --> 18:03.183
(Balki)
I’m sorry.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.585
I‐I had to return the documents

18:04.618 --> 18:06.252
to the archive
so I wouldn’t be slapped

18:06.286 --> 18:09.122
with that ten cents
a day late charge.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.357
Mr. Bartokomous, shall
we get started?

18:11.391 --> 18:12.593
Certainly.

18:12.626 --> 18:14.394
Mr. Appleton has the contracts.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.896
All we need is your signature.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.898
Well, uh, before that

18:17.931 --> 18:20.901
there’s something
that I must do.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.505
Right, alright, alright. This,
this will just take a minute.

Now, sit down and listen.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.535
Ahem.

18:56.537 --> 18:59.305
Once upon a time...

18:59.339 --> 19:01.775
...there was a beautiful
island in the South Pacific

19:01.808 --> 19:04.210
called Tamiki.
And the Tamiki‐ites‐‐

19:04.244 --> 19:05.879
Okay, uh, Balki,
Balki here’s a thought.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.549
Uh, why‐why don’t you,
uh, s‐sign the papers first

19:08.582 --> 19:12.352
and then do story time while
they’re making out our checks?

19:12.385 --> 19:14.187
Cousin, cousin, I’m trying
to get this story

19:14.220 --> 19:15.522
off the ground, okay?

19:15.556 --> 19:17.591
Just, just...

19:17.624 --> 19:19.793
The Tamiki‐ites were very happy.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.596
And then one day they sold
part of their island

19:22.629 --> 19:23.930
to a big corporation.

19:23.964 --> 19:26.399
Uh, the big corporation
wanted to use that land

19:26.432 --> 19:28.969
to store things.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.404
What kind of things
did they want to store?

19:31.437 --> 19:33.940
Well, we’re not talking
about things

19:33.974 --> 19:35.676
that you would store
in your garage

19:35.709 --> 19:38.211
like, uh, Christmas decorations

19:38.244 --> 19:40.781
and old National Geographic’s

19:40.814 --> 19:43.349
and the occasional Pez dispenser

19:43.383 --> 19:45.385
where the candy comes out
of the fish head.

19:46.987 --> 19:50.691
No. They wanted to store
some other kind of things.

19:50.724 --> 19:53.694
So...after a while

19:53.727 --> 19:55.829
the palm trees started to die

19:55.862 --> 19:59.733
and the water
started to smell bad

19:59.766 --> 20:02.569
and the Tamiki‐ites
started to get sick.

20:02.603 --> 20:04.571
And pretty soon
they had to move away

20:04.605 --> 20:06.006
from their beautiful island home

20:06.039 --> 20:08.709
because it wasn’t
beautiful anymore.

20:08.742 --> 20:10.644
What the big corporation
was storing there

20:10.677 --> 20:13.714
was toxic waste.

20:13.747 --> 20:15.015
And do you know
what is the name

20:15.048 --> 20:17.450
of the corporation
that did this to Tamiki?

20:17.483 --> 20:18.919
I’m feeling a little queasy.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.887
Do you have any saltines?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.324
The name of the corporation

20:24.357 --> 20:26.259
is Seifert Incorporated.

20:27.928 --> 20:29.730
Seifert Incorporated?

20:29.763 --> 20:31.998
Well‐well, Balki, that’s
a‐a very interesting fact

20:32.032 --> 20:34.801
but these nice people work
for Worldwide Amalgamated.

20:34.835 --> 20:36.937
So, let’s sign the papers.

20:38.539 --> 20:41.975
Worldwide Amalgamated
owns Seifert Incorporated.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.610
Babasticki!

20:47.013 --> 20:48.582
I learned this fact when I took

20:48.615 --> 20:50.584
the microfilm back
to the archives.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.686
And I would like
to take this opportunity

20:52.719 --> 20:56.389
to thank my official negotiating
adviser, Cousin Larry

20:56.422 --> 20:59.760
for suggesting that I show
the microfilm on the machine.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.632
I’m sorry, gentlemen.
We have no deal.

21:05.666 --> 21:07.568
Good day, gentlemen.

21:07.601 --> 21:09.536
Find me another island.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.976
‐No deal?
‐No deal.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.611
‐No deal?
‐No deal.

21:17.644 --> 21:20.013
But I wanted a deal.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.783
I wanted to have a deal.

21:34.928 --> 21:38.732
Come on, cousin. Come on.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.401
Just think of it...
Think of it this way.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.837
We saved the lives
of everyone on Mypos.

21:45.539 --> 21:48.374
Well, I guess
that’s a good thing.

21:50.711 --> 21:53.079
But all that money.

21:53.113 --> 21:54.948
Cousin, I know. I know.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.083
I know. Come on, come on.

21:57.117 --> 21:59.085
Ah, you’re right.

21:59.119 --> 22:00.386
[sighing]

22:00.420 --> 22:02.488
We did a good thing.

22:02.523 --> 22:03.657
Well, actually, uh

22:03.690 --> 22:06.693
you’re the one
who did the good thing.

22:06.727 --> 22:09.963
I was just trying
to do the best thing for Mypos.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.565
Well, you did.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.834
[sighing]

22:16.937 --> 22:18.471
I can understand
why they asked you

22:18.505 --> 22:21.041
to be the official negotiator.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.109
That King Ferdinand is no fool.

22:23.143 --> 22:24.811
Well, of course he’s not.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.580
Don’t be ridiculous.

22:29.149 --> 22:31.718
He just likes
to wear the outfit.

22:33.654 --> 22:35.589
[instrumental music]

22:41.662 --> 22:44.064
[theme music]

23:08.088 --> 23:10.023
[music continues]
