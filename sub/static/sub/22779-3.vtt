00:14.889 --> 00:16.099
Whoa. Whoa.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.740
[flies buzzing]

00:33.575 --> 00:34.951
[horse nickers]

00:35.035 --> 00:36.036
Whoa.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.541
You know this here
is all bad business, don't you, boy?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.183
Cheap spectacles.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.268
[mutters] Bunch of bullshit.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.329
Are you really that dumb, Mr. Goode...

01:21.164 --> 01:23.166
that you would ride yourself into a wall?

01:28.004 --> 01:29.714
Or were you really that smart?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.849
[echoes of hooves thundering]

01:47.482 --> 01:48.525
Either way...

01:50.401 --> 01:52.487
they must've thought they had you cold.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.157
[men yelling]

02:21.850 --> 02:22.851
[gunshot]

02:25.979 --> 02:27.397
[horse whinnies]

02:32.735 --> 02:34.362
The way you had to run him...

02:35.155 --> 02:37.115
the poor animal must have bottomed out.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.577
Wasn't no way he was gonna make it.

02:43.913 --> 02:45.456
So you set him free.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.005
[whinnies]

02:55.383 --> 02:56.676
[men yelling]

02:56.759 --> 02:57.635
[gunshot]

02:59.554 --> 03:03.141
But now it was you that had them.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.095
Seven men down
in the time it takes to spit.

03:45.975 --> 03:47.393
[buzzing]

03:48.019 --> 03:50.855
And all dead
before they even hit the ground.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.111
Except one.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.605
I imagine they became
real disenchanted after all of that...

04:34.482 --> 04:35.608
and rode off.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.071
But of course...

04:41.739 --> 04:42.865
they came back.

05:02.927 --> 05:06.139
It was over... even before it started.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.390
You saw it?

05:09.183 --> 05:10.351
Enough of it.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.189
Get...

05:21.112 --> 05:22.405
Was it how it reads?

05:23.364 --> 05:25.199
One man run off the whole bunch?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.536
If you had seen the man shoot,
you would run off, too.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.290
They're all on the hanging road now.

05:34.917 --> 05:36.127
What are you, Navajo?

05:37.170 --> 05:38.171
Shoshone.

05:38.713 --> 05:39.714
Shoshone?

05:40.548 --> 05:42.091
The hell you doing down here?

05:42.633 --> 05:43.968
Besides sneaking up on me.

05:44.927 --> 05:45.928
Living.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.973
Game's all dried up on the reservation.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.685
And I didn't sneak up on you.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.354
You didn't see me.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.982
Can you even see me now?

05:59.358 --> 06:01.277
I can see just fine.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.447
Is that why you almost fell over
that dead horse down there?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.578
The man who did all the fancy shooting...

06:11.287 --> 06:12.789
you recall what he looked like?

06:12.872 --> 06:13.873
Like Death.

06:13.956 --> 06:14.957
[grunts]

06:15.583 --> 06:17.168
Could you be more specific?

06:20.088 --> 06:20.922
Hm.

06:21.631 --> 06:22.465
"Hm"?

06:23.132 --> 06:24.300
"Hm," what?

06:25.134 --> 06:26.219
You lost your shadow.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.229
[dog barks]

06:36.312 --> 06:38.314
[instrumental theme music plays]

07:34.662 --> 07:36.747
Frank Griffin was born in Arkansas,

07:36.831 --> 07:39.459
but raised by Mormons in Utah.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.504
He come out with the Fancher party
when he was but a boy.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.175
That's them folks who got massacred
by the Indians back in '54.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.678
Was the Mormons done it,
but they laid it on the Paiutes.

07:50.761 --> 07:52.597
Hm, so say the Paiutes.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.309
The point is, Griffin seems to have lost
all hold of hisself

07:56.392 --> 07:57.977
ever since Roy Goode left him.

07:58.060 --> 08:00.354
Not that he ever had
that much of a grip to begin with.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.399
Marshal...

08:04.859 --> 08:07.320
I appreciate your concern
for my well-being,

08:07.403 --> 08:10.531
but as you might have noticed,
I do got one or two good men with me.

08:10.615 --> 08:13.659
I don't give a hoot in hell
about your well-being.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.622
It's them ladies down in La Belle
that worry me.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.499
As you know,

08:19.582 --> 08:21.751
they only got the one law down there.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.085
If you can call him that.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.587
[laughter]

08:27.256 --> 08:30.426
If I could ask you, sir,
until I get a rope around Griffin,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.136
to keep your men nearby,

08:32.220 --> 08:34.347
that would sure relieve me of my concern.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.726
You got nothing to worry about, Marshal.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.188
Mr. Logan there, my new head of security,

08:42.271 --> 08:44.774
is presently rounding up
all the necessary men.

08:45.441 --> 08:48.069
Looks to me
like he's presently eating his breakfast.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.947
Marshal, the Quicksilver Mining Syndicate

08:51.030 --> 08:54.158
now has a vested interest
in the La Belle claim,

08:54.242 --> 08:57.453
which, I might add,
holds a rather considerable amount of ore.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.374
And we mean to look after it
the way we do all our investments.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.460
Same way you looked after Creede?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.089
Good luck on your hunt, Marshal.

09:11.008 --> 09:12.218
Two pounds of flour.

09:15.429 --> 09:16.430
A pound of bacon.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.599
Another pound of coffee.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.228
Two boxes of shells for the Winchester.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.312
Forty-four?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.606
Fifty ninety-five, if you please.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.693
Are you hunting buffalo?

09:28.776 --> 09:30.194
Why? You seen any?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.072
You break that jar, girl,

09:33.155 --> 09:34.740
and you gonna pay for it!

09:39.495 --> 09:41.998
Where has your brother run off to?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.084
If he didn't tell you,
I'm certainly not gonna.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.337
Time he gave up that star,
don't you think?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.007
[Asa] Goddamn it, girl!

09:51.090 --> 09:53.050
I told you to keep your hands off!

09:53.134 --> 09:54.302
Now, I want you...

09:57.346 --> 09:59.765
Go ahead. Yell at her again.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.268
[sighs]

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
She's not right in the head.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.273
Neither will you be
if you keep hauling at her like that.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.037
We'll take the licorice, too.

Aunt Maggie,

10:53.277 --> 10:55.363
that lady ain't got hardly any clothes on.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.365
No, she does not.

10:57.448 --> 10:59.325
[Charlotte]
What does she think she's doing?

10:59.825 --> 11:01.827
Airing out her privates, looks like.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.120
[Charlotte scoffs]

11:03.996 --> 11:06.165
I hear she's worth a million dollars.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.794
Husband had a brewery in Berlin.

11:10.711 --> 11:12.546
Moved to Mexico to open another one.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.799
She lost her mind and run off.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.842
Her man was in beer?

11:16.926 --> 11:17.927
So I'm told.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.678
Too bad it wasn't mining.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.013
[Charlotte chuckles]

11:22.640 --> 11:23.724
Come on, kids.

11:31.982 --> 11:33.109
What's all this, then?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.029
W-What's all this, then?

11:37.113 --> 11:38.322
I asked you first.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.616
William! Jesus! Leave that man be.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.287
Where does he live, anyways?

11:46.580 --> 11:47.665
I don't know.

[Roy clicks tongue]

12:48.893 --> 12:49.894
All right.

12:50.394 --> 12:51.479
Pull her up.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.399

14:34.373 --> 14:35.207

Open the gate, boy.

17:04.606 --> 17:05.441
What?

17:06.692 --> 17:07.693
Open the damn gate!

Good to see you again, boy.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.743
There he is!

18:58.011 --> 18:59.221
Y'all got company.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.222
We've come for Mr. Ward.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.686
[Whitey] Wait.

19:51.231 --> 19:52.816
The indecency of what you've done.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.652
Breaking a man out of jail like that.

19:57.070 --> 19:58.363
Well, it's unspeakable.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.200
You're just mad
you didn't think of it yourself.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.035
[Whitey]
Now don't give me no kind of fuss,

20:03.118 --> 20:05.412
and we'll just forget
what happened last night, all right?

20:06.413 --> 20:07.623
Mr. Ward?

20:09.499 --> 20:11.168
I'm gonna ask you real nice

20:11.251 --> 20:13.921
to take your pick
of these two wagons here and climb aboard.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.843
Now, I ain't gonna ask you twice.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.511
Ladies, I'll make you a deal.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.599
Let him stay here
and help me break all these horses

20:25.682 --> 20:28.185
and I'll sell you all but six for 4,500.

20:28.852 --> 20:30.562
That's less than 100 each.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.189
You're only gonna keep six?

20:32.272 --> 20:34.942
When I'm done, I'm gonna pack up
and go home to Boston.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.613
This place has never been my home, and,
thanks to all of you, it never will be.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.032
-Ma'am, I can't let you--
-Forty-three hundred.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.700
-Done.
-Damn it, Mary-Agnes.

20:47.579 --> 20:50.123
Sheriff ain't gonna like this. Not at all.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.667
Sheriff ain't here.

20:52.834 --> 20:53.877
[Mary-Agnes] Whitey...

20:55.420 --> 20:57.089
you either go along with this...

20:59.174 --> 21:00.676
or we lock you up again.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.763
[Whitey chuckles]

21:04.846 --> 21:07.641
-What, you think you're faster than me?
-No, I know I am.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.184
In a pig's ass.

21:17.609 --> 21:18.694
You want to try again?

21:22.990 --> 21:24.741
Can I offer you all some coffee?

21:25.242 --> 21:26.827
That sounds right nice.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.124
[indistinct chatter]

21:43.343 --> 21:44.386
[Grigg] Marshal!

21:46.972 --> 21:47.806
A word!

21:56.064 --> 21:58.984
Son, go and get yourself
a candy or something.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.070
Go on.

22:04.948 --> 22:05.991
You care to sit?

22:08.243 --> 22:09.244
Please.

22:10.996 --> 22:15.709
Now, I hear you're on your way
to Olegrande to see Colonel Lowell.

22:16.793 --> 22:18.503
If you hear it, it must be true.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.299
He's a good man, Jeff Lowell.
I interviewed him once.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.552
Would this have anything to do
with what all went on up in Creede?

22:26.053 --> 22:28.013
Are you interviewing me now, Mr. Grigg?

22:28.889 --> 22:30.932
If you want to find Frank Griffin...

22:31.767 --> 22:33.060
you have to know him.

22:34.227 --> 22:35.979
You have to know how he thinks.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.024
And you have to know
how he and Roy started.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.442
And to know all of that...

22:41.610 --> 22:44.071
you've got to go and talk
to Sister Lucy Cole.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.739
Sister who?

22:45.822 --> 22:46.823
Lucy Cole.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.742
Lives in the town of Moses,

22:48.825 --> 22:50.118
near the Oklahoma border.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.662
What all has she got to do with anything?

22:53.038 --> 22:57.376
Well, she raised Roy Goode from the time
he was a whelp to the time he was 15.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.753
And you think he might go back there?

23:00.670 --> 23:02.089
He already has.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.675
A nun saw him up there

23:05.759 --> 23:07.302
not more than a few weeks ago.

23:07.677 --> 23:10.472
Jesus! How many nuns are there in Moses?

23:10.555 --> 23:11.765
[Grigg laughs]

23:12.557 --> 23:14.476
Well, Lucy's not really a nun.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.229
[chuckles]
Not in a spiritual sense, anyway.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.108
She calls herself "sister" on account
of her gifts have always been...

23:22.818 --> 23:24.319
well, more sisterly,

23:24.402 --> 23:25.654
if you know what I mean.

23:27.322 --> 23:31.284
And you're offering up
this free intelligence because...?

23:31.368 --> 23:33.495
Oh, I offer nothing for free.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.582
No, there's a story afoot.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.461
And thanks to Frank,
I am smack dab in the middle of it.

23:42.754 --> 23:43.922
I'm gonna give you...

23:44.005 --> 23:45.132
[pencil scratching]

23:45.215 --> 23:46.675
...Lucy's particulars.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.802
[paper tearing]

23:48.885 --> 23:50.762
And maybe next time you're in Taos...

23:51.596 --> 23:53.515
you'll give me that interview.

23:54.266 --> 23:57.310
Oh, I doubt I'll be back this way
anytime soon.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.356
Air's just a little too thin for me.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.236
You see Frank again...

24:10.323 --> 24:12.450
tell him John Cook's coming for him.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.382
[boy] Marshal Cook?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.534

25:44.960 --> 25:46.920
That your camp I seen a ways back?

25:50.131 --> 25:51.341
You speak English?

25:51.424 --> 25:53.176
[coughing continues]

25:57.806 --> 25:59.140
Looks like y'all had some company.

26:01.726 --> 26:02.811
About 30 men?

26:03.937 --> 26:06.064
[coughing]

26:08.149 --> 26:09.025
Ma'am.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.988
They are a day ahead of us.

[woman speaks in Norwegian]

26:16.157 --> 26:17.200
[speaks in Norwegian]

26:18.159 --> 26:20.704
Yes... there were 30.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.582
He said he would kill us
if we ever spoke of him.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.795
You'd be wise to believe the man.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.340
Do you know these men?

26:34.467 --> 26:35.593
I do.

26:37.971 --> 26:39.264
Are you hunting them?

26:41.975 --> 26:43.184
I am.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.189
Just you?

26:51.735 --> 26:53.320
They say where they were going?

26:55.238 --> 26:57.240
[coughing]

26:57.907 --> 26:59.993
[McNue] Your little girl's
likely got camp colic.

27:00.076 --> 27:03.204
If I was you, I would do her up
in mustard, rub her in liniment,

27:03.288 --> 27:05.081
then dose her with some hot whiskey.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.966
I heard one of them mention
a town called Olegrande.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.345
Thank you, ma'am.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.889
You find them, Sheriff.

27:21.681 --> 27:23.975
You find them and you kill them all.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.202
[Sadie blows]

27:44.371 --> 27:45.455
Hey, Sadie.

27:47.040 --> 27:49.167
What are y'all doing up here by yourself?

27:49.751 --> 27:53.088
Whatever I can to get this place ready
for the new preacher.

27:54.172 --> 27:57.258
-Why? Is he here?
-Not yet, but he's coming.

27:57.675 --> 27:58.676
Are you sure?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.179
Yes, I've got the telegram right here.

28:02.013 --> 28:02.889
Really?

28:05.183 --> 28:08.520
"I will be shortly traveling by rail

28:08.603 --> 28:12.440
from Scranton, Pennsylvania
to your environs.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.318
I look forward to seeing this country

28:15.402 --> 28:19.155
and to meeting the La Belle congregation
upon my arrival.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.700
Yours prayerfully, Pastor Garrett Moore."

28:24.786 --> 28:26.955
Ain't that exactly what he said
three months ago?

28:28.540 --> 28:29.624
Yes.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.167
It's the same telegram.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.547
It's a long way, Pennsylvania.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.384
Yes, ma'am, it is.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.221
And he did say
he wanted to see the country,

28:43.304 --> 28:46.933
so maybe he stopped somewhere
along the way...

28:47.600 --> 28:49.686
to get a better taste of the...

28:50.979 --> 28:52.230
wherever he was.

28:53.273 --> 28:54.566
He might well have done.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.280
Well, I will, uh...
I'll leave you to your work.

29:00.989 --> 29:03.491
You do think he's coming,
don't you, Whitey?

29:05.618 --> 29:06.703
Oh, yes, ma'am.

29:07.996 --> 29:11.332
I'm sure it's like you said, he probably
stopped off somewhere on the way.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.421
You have a good day, ma'am.

29:16.504 --> 29:17.672
You, too, Whitey.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.724
Where you off to?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.519
Oh, no place.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.689
I was just gonna go for a ride.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.609
Before I go stir-crazy around here.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.987
Can't say as I blame you,
but you've got to eat first.

29:42.280 --> 29:43.865
You're getting too damn skinny.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.748
Have you got anything clean to eat with?

29:51.831 --> 29:53.500
Um... Yeah.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.837
What did I do with that spoon?

30:02.717 --> 30:03.760
Oh, yeah.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.683
You know where he lives?

30:12.977 --> 30:14.395
-[Whitey] John Doe?
-Mm-hm.

30:14.896 --> 30:15.897
[Whitey] No, I do not.

30:16.272 --> 30:18.233
I guess I never really thought about that.

30:18.983 --> 30:20.109
Neither have I.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.404
Sad fellow, ain't he?

30:24.155 --> 30:25.323
Ain't we all?

30:26.699 --> 30:27.700
Eat.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.208
Bill say anything to you before he left...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.293
about what all he was up to?

30:37.961 --> 30:41.130
No, not much. Just that he was
going after Frank Griffin.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.632
That's all he told me, too.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.467
He's lost his damn mind.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.677
No.

30:46.219 --> 30:48.096
He's just tired of feeling useless is all.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.139
[sighs]

30:52.725 --> 30:54.060
You worried about him?

30:54.143 --> 30:55.353
Of course I am.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.230
Aren't you?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.818
He should've brought me with him.

31:03.152 --> 31:04.612
I'd watch his back.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.448
I heard about you
and those two cowboys the other night.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.869
People are talking about that, are they?

31:11.911 --> 31:13.872
Well, it was some pretty fancy shooting,

31:13.955 --> 31:15.081
if I do say so.

31:15.164 --> 31:18.126
So are you gonna paste everybody
who makes a smart remark?

31:18.209 --> 31:21.212
-I was just getting their attention.
-And if you got more than that?

31:21.296 --> 31:23.840
Say you shot one of them
in the head instead of the arm.

31:23.923 --> 31:27.844
That'd never happen unless I wanted it to.
There's too much skill on my end.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.262
Say one of them shot you.

31:31.681 --> 31:32.765
Too much luck.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.310
You think you're lucky?

31:36.436 --> 31:40.189
Whitey, I hate to break it to you,
but your clover don't exactly run deep.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.025
Well, I'm lucky I got you.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.323
[sighs]

31:52.410 --> 31:54.162
You let me outdraw you the other day?

31:54.746 --> 31:57.248
No, ma'am.
I would never let anyone do that.

31:57.332 --> 31:59.542
'Cause we both know I'm faster
without your charity.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.044

All right.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:55.068
all commenced shooting at each other
at the same time.

1:00:55.943 --> 1:00:58.821
-Then what?
-Then you would have killed them all.

1:00:58.905 --> 1:01:01.574
Maybe, but like as not,
you could be dead, too.

1:01:03.201 --> 1:01:06.579
And if we were standing in some street,
some other folk might be dead, too.

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:07.997
But we weren't in a street.

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:10.792
You should never have to eat
another man's dirt.

1:01:11.459 --> 1:01:14.337
But sometimes it's easier to go home...

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:17.590
with a grudge
and your pride sullied some...

1:01:18.132 --> 1:01:20.218
than it is to go out
and get yourself killed.

1:01:20.301 --> 1:01:22.136
You boys gonna come in and eat or what?

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:23.930
We'll be right there with you, ma'am.

1:01:46.619 --> 1:01:51.582
"Frank Griffin made a surprise appearance
in Taos this past Monday evening

1:01:51.666 --> 1:01:54.627
and gave this reporter
an exclusive interview.

1:01:55.211 --> 1:01:57.380
Griffin informed A.T. Grigg

1:01:57.463 --> 1:02:00.925
that Roy Goode was to blame
for the deaths in Creede

1:02:01.008 --> 1:02:05.012
and several other mining towns
throughout New Mexico and Colorado.

1:02:05.805 --> 1:02:09.225
Griffin said,
'I aim to take care of those poor devils

1:02:09.308 --> 1:02:12.353
who treat me with the respect
any man deserves,

1:02:12.437 --> 1:02:14.856
but Roy Goode has betrayed me,

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:18.818
and I will kill any man,
woman or child who harbors him.'"

1:02:18.901 --> 1:02:20.319
[hooves beating]

1:02:24.532 --> 1:02:26.659
That doesn't look like the new preacher.

1:02:43.968 --> 1:02:45.428
[horse nickers]

1:02:45.511 --> 1:02:46.512
[Logan] Ladies.

1:02:47.013 --> 1:02:49.974
My name's Ed Logan,
head of security for Quicksilver Mining,

1:02:50.057 --> 1:02:51.809
the new owners of this here town.

1:02:52.727 --> 1:02:56.981
From here on in, it's gonna be, uh,
we who's gonna be looking after you.

1:02:57.565 --> 1:03:00.234
Mr. Blacksmith,
we're gonna need that whole livery.

1:03:00.318 --> 1:03:02.779
I expect more men over the next few days.

1:03:02.862 --> 1:03:05.031
It's $2 a day for the whole place.

1:03:05.114 --> 1:03:06.657
Fair price. Thank you.

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:10.286
I thought there would be more of them.

1:03:10.369 --> 1:03:12.663
-There will be.
-I don't like this.

1:03:12.747 --> 1:03:15.333
-Of course you don't.
-And I do not like him.

1:03:15.416 --> 1:03:16.542
[Logan] Boy.

1:03:18.836 --> 1:03:21.172
We're gonna need
that sheriff's office, too.

1:03:21.255 --> 1:03:24.133
Well, that's something you're gonna
have to take up with the sheriff.

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:26.427
OK. Where might he be at?

1:03:32.058 --> 1:03:33.226
That's what I thought.

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:36.479
From now on, I'm the new sheriff
of La Belle, New Mexico,

1:03:36.562 --> 1:03:38.231
and these here men are all my deputies.

1:03:39.857 --> 1:03:42.902
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

1:03:43.486 --> 1:03:46.781
if there's anything you need,
I mean anything at all...

1:03:47.365 --> 1:03:48.574
we're here to help.

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:51.744
Let's leave our horses with you, sir...

1:03:52.203 --> 1:03:54.747
while I check in to your fine hotel.

1:03:57.667 --> 1:03:58.668
[man] Ma'am.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.509
Now, what do you suppose she wants?

1:04:13.850 --> 1:04:16.352
Miss Dunne... may I speak with you?

1:04:18.312 --> 1:04:19.313
Privately?

1:04:20.147 --> 1:04:21.148
Of course.

1:04:44.005 --> 1:04:46.382
What is it I can help you with,
Miss Fletcher?

1:04:46.757 --> 1:04:48.259
"Alice," please.

1:04:49.051 --> 1:04:51.304
I was wondering
if I could borrow a primer,

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:52.638
if you have an extra one?

1:04:53.598 --> 1:04:55.057
As I recall,

1:04:55.141 --> 1:04:57.393
your boy can already read and write.

1:05:01.022 --> 1:05:02.189
Of course.

1:05:07.945 --> 1:05:09.322
I'll get it back to you.

1:05:09.405 --> 1:05:10.406
Take your time.

1:05:12.074 --> 1:05:14.535
[Callie] That's Magdalena, the old madam.

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:17.788
You know, you could have made
a lot of money in here.

1:05:20.416 --> 1:05:21.250
How much?

1:05:23.002 --> 1:05:24.629
At least 200 a month.

1:05:25.796 --> 1:05:27.256
That's a lot, all right.

1:05:27.673 --> 1:05:30.801
Twice what my brother makes
as a bank clerk in Austin.

1:05:31.719 --> 1:05:32.929
And tough as you are,

1:05:33.346 --> 1:05:34.639
you could be a madam,

1:05:35.139 --> 1:05:37.475
open up your own place and make even more.

1:05:37.558 --> 1:05:38.643
How much more?

1:05:39.185 --> 1:05:40.353
A few thousand.

1:05:42.229 --> 1:05:43.230
Really?

1:05:44.774 --> 1:05:47.443
A whore's life isn't so bad
if you play it right.

1:05:47.526 --> 1:05:51.572
I mean, who do you think bankrolled
half the businesses in this town?

1:05:52.615 --> 1:05:54.909
Hell, who do you think
is paying for your horses?

1:05:57.203 --> 1:06:00.998
There's more words for "whore"
than there is for "doctor" or "lawyer."

1:06:02.959 --> 1:06:04.043
Really?

1:06:05.419 --> 1:06:06.504
Tell me some.

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:13.552
Thank you.

1:06:14.053 --> 1:06:15.179
Any time.

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:18.057
[door opening]

1:06:18.849 --> 1:06:19.850
[door closing]

1:06:19.934 --> 1:06:22.603
[Whitey] That Logan fella's
gonna kill this poor horse.

1:06:24.063 --> 1:06:25.815
If the horse don't kill him first.

1:06:26.524 --> 1:06:27.733
[scoffs]

1:06:27.817 --> 1:06:31.988
You push a creature far enough,
eventually it will push back.

1:06:32.071 --> 1:06:36.033
Some men, though, they ain't smart enough
to know when they're tempting fate.

1:06:39.578 --> 1:06:41.580
I seen you riding out to Blackdom
the other day.

1:06:42.623 --> 1:06:44.417
Them folks have their own ways.

1:06:45.001 --> 1:06:46.002
[Whitey grunts]

1:06:46.502 --> 1:06:48.004
Yeah, I know that.

1:06:48.504 --> 1:06:51.966
They can be dangerous,
them buffalo soldiers.

1:06:52.550 --> 1:06:53.551
Them what?

1:06:54.051 --> 1:06:55.469
Them buffalo soldiers.

1:06:55.553 --> 1:06:57.638
That's what they all are out there.

1:06:57.722 --> 1:06:59.056
What, they hunted buffalo?

1:06:59.724 --> 1:07:03.060
They hunted men
for the 10th Cavalry right after the war.

1:07:03.144 --> 1:07:04.603
Men? What men?

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:06.313
Oh, Cheyenne, mostly,

1:07:06.397 --> 1:07:09.233
but also Comanches and Apaches.

1:07:09.817 --> 1:07:11.318
They're good gunfighters.

1:07:11.819 --> 1:07:13.195
Better than most white men.

1:07:14.238 --> 1:07:17.324
-Why do they call them buffalo soldiers?
-Well...

1:07:18.159 --> 1:07:21.662
John Randall, the uncle of the girl
you're so sweet on out there...

1:07:21.746 --> 1:07:23.664
No, I ain't... I ain't, um...

1:07:25.207 --> 1:07:26.834
He once, all by himself,

1:07:26.917 --> 1:07:29.503
held off 70 Cheyenne with only his pistol

1:07:29.587 --> 1:07:31.172
and a few rounds of ammunition.

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:34.341
And by the time
help from the nearby camp came,

1:07:34.425 --> 1:07:36.719
13 of them Cheyenne braves were dead...

1:07:37.678 --> 1:07:41.098
and John Randall had a bullet wound
to the shoulder

1:07:41.182 --> 1:07:43.726
and a dozen lance wounds, but he made it.

1:07:43.809 --> 1:07:44.643
Jesus.

1:07:44.727 --> 1:07:46.353
The Cheyenne went and spread word

1:07:46.437 --> 1:07:50.691
about a new kind of soldier
that fought like a cornered buffalo.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:53.027
A man who, like a buffalo,

1:07:53.110 --> 1:07:55.571
suffered wound after wound,
but didn't die.

1:07:56.405 --> 1:07:57.782
A man who, like a buffalo,

1:07:57.865 --> 1:08:00.326
had him a thick, curly head of hair.

1:08:02.620 --> 1:08:03.996
So this is Louise's uncle?

1:08:04.622 --> 1:08:05.956
And her father,

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:07.458
and the other men out there.

1:08:08.626 --> 1:08:11.420
Or that's...
that's what they were, anyhow.

1:08:11.837 --> 1:08:13.506
Now they just want to farm.

1:08:15.091 --> 1:08:16.884
They want to be left alone.

1:08:18.677 --> 1:08:21.013
They certainly don't need
no white boy riding out there,

1:08:21.097 --> 1:08:22.848
bringing all his white troubles with him.

1:08:30.397 --> 1:08:31.732
[dog barks]

1:08:56.715 --> 1:08:57.716
[Roy]  "Buzz...

1:08:59.051 --> 1:09:00.052
buzz...

1:09:02.096 --> 1:09:02.972
buzz.

1:09:03.472 --> 1:09:05.432
This is...

1:09:06.058 --> 1:09:07.059

1:09:08.435 --> 1:09:09.645

1:09:10.312 --> 1:09:11.397
"Song."

1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:12.481
"...song...

1:09:13.065 --> 1:09:14.066
of...

1:09:15.359 --> 1:09:16.986
the... bee."

1:09:48.934 --> 1:09:50.686
Y'all open for business?

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:52.980
Yes, sir.

1:09:55.107 --> 1:09:57.109
Glass of bonded, please.

1:10:02.865 --> 1:10:05.576
Supposed to be a cavalry regiment
up this way.

1:10:05.659 --> 1:10:06.660
Yes, sir.

1:10:07.161 --> 1:10:09.538
They've been out on patrol
for over a week now.

1:10:10.998 --> 1:10:12.082
Range war...

1:10:12.750 --> 1:10:13.959
up by Eaton.

1:10:22.343 --> 1:10:23.677
Know when they will be back?

1:10:25.095 --> 1:10:27.223
No, Marshal, I don't.

1:10:31.018 --> 1:10:32.353
Where is everybody?

1:10:34.146 --> 1:10:35.356
[match striking]

1:10:37.441 --> 1:10:38.484
Hey, there.

1:10:49.870 --> 1:10:50.996
Marshal.

1:10:54.375 --> 1:10:55.793
[glass shattering]

1:10:56.794 --> 1:10:57.795
[Roy]  "Buzz...

1:10:59.129 --> 1:11:00.130
buzz...

1:11:02.132 --> 1:11:02.967
buzz.

1:11:03.676 --> 1:11:06.303
This is the song...

1:11:06.887 --> 1:11:08.806
of the bee."

1:11:41.505 --> 1:11:43.340
[footsteps]

1:11:49.096 --> 1:11:49.930
[Frank] What is it?

1:12:00.858 --> 1:12:01.859
[chuckles]

1:12:03.068 --> 1:12:04.611
[Roy]  "Buzz, buzz, buzz.

1:12:05.154 --> 1:12:08.407
This is the song of the bee."
