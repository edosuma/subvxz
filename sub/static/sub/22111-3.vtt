* Mama told me
not to sell work *
* Mama *

00:08.109 --> 00:11.312
* 17 five, same color T-shirt
* White *

00:11.345 --> 00:14.415
* Mama told me
not to sell work *
* Mama *

00:14.448 --> 00:17.618
* 17 five, same color T-shirt

00:17.651 --> 00:19.753
* Do it for the culture
* Culture *

00:19.787 --> 00:22.223
* They gon' bite like vultures
* Vultures *

00:22.256 --> 00:25.393
* Way back when I was
trapping out Toyotas... *

00:25.426 --> 00:27.495
(distant bang)

00:27.528 --> 00:28.496
Hello?

00:28.529 --> 00:30.131
* Space coupe, Quavo Yoda

00:30.164 --> 00:31.765
Is anyone there?

00:31.799 --> 00:33.367
* On my own, sir

00:33.401 --> 00:35.536
* Heard you gon' clone, sir

00:35.569 --> 00:36.804
* Stop all that flexin'

00:36.837 --> 00:38.739
* Young ...
don't want to go there *

00:38.772 --> 00:42.176
* Never been a gopher
but I always been a soldier *

00:42.210 --> 00:44.212
* Young ... in the cut

00:44.245 --> 00:45.679
* Posted like a vulture

00:45.713 --> 00:47.181
* Divin' off the stage...

00:47.215 --> 00:48.216
(music shuts off)

00:58.226 --> 01:00.228
(panting)

01:02.830 --> 01:04.332
Step back. Now.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.433
Whoa.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.701
Sorry to scare you. I-I just...
You were just what?

01:07.735 --> 01:10.304
Well, I-I was... not...
You can tell it to me,

01:10.338 --> 01:12.240
or you can tell it
to the police.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.641
The police? I'm sorry, okay?

01:13.674 --> 01:16.177
I was just... I was gonna
ask you for your phone number.

01:16.210 --> 01:18.346
Please, don't
call the cops.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.313
Or hit me.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.283
(exhales)

01:22.316 --> 01:23.884
I'm sorry.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.320
I really got to stick
to the dating apps.

01:26.354 --> 01:28.256
(laughs)
I mean, they may
damage my ego,

01:28.289 --> 01:30.591
but there's never any chance
of physical violence.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.092
(gunshots)

01:37.231 --> 01:38.799
Oh, my God.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.637
*

02:01.955 --> 02:04.158
*

02:19.840 --> 02:22.243
Hey. Thanks
for doing this.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.344
Not a problem.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.913
(sighs) I just didn't want
to have to deal with...

02:25.946 --> 02:28.148
You don't have
to say any more.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.918
Well, thank you.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.421
Is that all of it?

02:33.454 --> 02:34.822
Everything from the house.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.724
I told your Realtor
we'd come back tomorrow

02:36.757 --> 02:38.192
and empty the garage.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.394
If you want,
I can take it to storage.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.463
Don't need it.

02:42.496 --> 02:46.434
Secured all my
weapons and ammo.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.337
Kids took what
they wanted.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.571
(sighs heavily)

02:50.604 --> 02:53.274
The rest of this goes
to the homeless shelter.

02:53.307 --> 02:54.575
Maybe I just hold onto it
until you...

02:54.608 --> 02:55.843
I'm good.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.380
Done. It all gets donated.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.915
(sighs)
Except the tools.

03:01.949 --> 03:04.385
I'm holding onto
the tools for you.

03:04.418 --> 03:08.556
Damn crazy if you think we're
out here just giving tools away.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.258
Thanks, Tom.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.896
(Deeks exhales sharply)

03:15.929 --> 03:16.964
Son of a...

03:16.997 --> 03:18.566
Almost impressive.

03:18.599 --> 03:22.836
Mosley, hey.
Sorry, uh...

03:22.870 --> 03:24.805
Assistant Director Executive...

03:24.838 --> 03:27.475
Director Executive
of Assist...

03:27.508 --> 03:28.409
I'm pretty sure there's...
(chuckles)

03:28.442 --> 03:29.943
...there's a "Director"
and an "Assistant"

03:29.977 --> 03:31.512
in there somewhere.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.581
I'm sorry,
am I fired again?

03:33.614 --> 03:36.484
How long would you keep talking
if no one stopped you?

03:36.517 --> 03:37.818
Many before you
have searched

03:37.851 --> 03:39.587
for the answer
to that very question.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.755
And, just for the record,
I would have had to rehire you

03:41.789 --> 03:43.824
in order to fire you again,
which I didn't do,

03:43.857 --> 03:45.626
because I don't normally
hire people

03:45.659 --> 03:47.928
that don't take care
of their appearance.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.697
Oh, no, no, no, thi-this is...

03:49.730 --> 03:52.566
I was undercover as a...
as a homeless...

03:52.600 --> 03:54.702
I can... I'll lose this.
Gone. Consider it gone.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.037
Please, just don't send me back
to the K-9 unit.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.506
And, no, that is not
a figure of speech.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.973
Why do you want
to work here, Mr. Deeks?

04:00.007 --> 04:02.343
Wow. All right.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.545
No cocktails,
no dancing--

04:04.578 --> 04:06.046
just gonna get
right in there, huh?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.581
Why NCIS?

04:07.615 --> 04:11.519
Um, you know, it's where
my passion lies.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.522
I'm very passionate about
investigating and defeating

04:14.555 --> 04:15.956
the criminals and terrorists

04:15.989 --> 04:17.925
and the foreign-intelligence
threats

04:17.958 --> 04:21.329
across the, uh, United States
Navy and Marine Corps.

04:21.362 --> 04:25.065
BOTH: Ashore, afloat,
and in cyberspace.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.133
Yeah.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.803
Did you just recite the NCIS
mission statement to me?

04:29.837 --> 04:31.605
(laughs):
Oh, did I do that?

04:31.639 --> 04:32.806
I didn't even notice,
'cause it's just so

04:32.840 --> 04:35.443
deeply ingrained in the fabric
of who I am at this point.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.811
I'm sorry, did you
just... you smile?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.880
Does that mean I just
bought myself another day?

04:39.913 --> 04:42.416
Can you make that shot?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.451
Can I make that shot?

04:43.484 --> 04:44.918
(scoffs)
Right here.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.654
Does a bear poop
in the woods?

04:46.687 --> 04:49.390
Don't answer that.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.325
Of no consequence.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.728
Cash. Ooh!

04:54.762 --> 04:57.631
Impressive. Looks like you just
got yourself another day

04:57.665 --> 04:59.032
working with your fiancÃ©e.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.902
Oh, yeah, with my fiancÃ©e.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.571
Nice. All right,
what about you?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.673
How 'bout me what?

05:05.706 --> 05:07.408
Go ahead and take a shot.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.410
Do I look like a girl that's
gonna take a shot right now?

05:09.443 --> 05:11.379
Do you see what I'm wearing?
Do you see what I have on?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.914
I mean, you look...
you look very nice,

05:13.947 --> 05:15.383
if that's what you mean.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.984
Thank you.
All right, I get it.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.486
You're obviously
very intimidated

05:18.519 --> 05:21.355
by my, uh, perfect
form and shooting.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.557
"Intimidated"?
Intimidated...

05:23.591 --> 05:26.560
How about three years
at UConn, varsity?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.729
Google it.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.000
(door shuts)

05:33.033 --> 05:37.371
UConn, huh?
Is that a community college?

05:37.405 --> 05:39.373
(ball swishes through net)

05:39.407 --> 05:40.574
(muffled gunshots)

05:40.608 --> 05:42.643
(shell casing clatters on floor)

05:46.914 --> 05:48.649
Morning.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.584
KENSI:
What's going on, Hidoko?
Good morning.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.522
Care for some morning
shooting range fun?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.557
I was just
finishing up.

05:56.590 --> 05:57.691
Come on, a little
game of H-O-R-S-E.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.460
Whoever wins picks
the lunch spot.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.461
I really should get going.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.630
We'll let you go first.
You can pick the target.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.398
Really, I'm good.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.401
Oh, well, top of the morning
to you, Agents Callen,

06:07.435 --> 06:08.836
Blye, Hidoko.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.504
Who won the shooting
contest?

06:10.538 --> 06:12.773
KENSI:
No shooting.
Is there a case on deck?

06:12.806 --> 06:14.675
There is a case on deck.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.076
Thanks.
Okay.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.814
Okay.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.656
This morning,
Navy Lieutenant Naomi Elder

06:28.689 --> 06:31.091
was shot and killed
at a downtown aquatic center

06:31.124 --> 06:32.826
directly after finishing
her workout.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.127
Where was she stationed?

06:34.161 --> 06:36.697
She was on leave
from the Naval Computer

06:36.730 --> 06:39.467
and Telecommunications
Area Master Station Pacific.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.034
That's at Joint Base
Pearl Harbor-Hickam.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.170
It's an impressive facility.
I was there a few years back.

06:43.203 --> 06:44.705
What was the
lieutenant's job?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.607
Uh, she worked with
a small, elite unit

06:46.640 --> 06:48.041
monitoring and cataloguing

06:48.075 --> 06:50.544
classified naval
intelligence communications.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.513
Was she traveling
with any navy property?

06:52.546 --> 06:54.615
According to here
commanding officer, no.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.117
She was never issued
a navy laptop or cell phone.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.152
She was only traveling
with personal items.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.954
She was driving a car

07:00.988 --> 07:03.491
registered to Keith
and Lynn Stiger

07:03.524 --> 07:04.892
of Silver Lake.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.794
Apparently, the lieutenant
was staying with them.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.462
Any witnesses
to the shooting?

07:08.496 --> 07:10.798
Uh, yes. LAPD has him
at the scene now.

07:10.831 --> 07:11.965
Sam and I'll go to
the Stigers' house,

07:11.999 --> 07:13.501
look into the victim.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.736
Why don't you and Kensi
go over to the crime scene?

07:15.769 --> 07:16.970
That work for you?

07:17.004 --> 07:19.807
Yeah. I'll inform
E.A.D. Mosley.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.716
So, just to clarify,

07:28.749 --> 07:30.718
you didn't know
Lieutenant Elder at all?

07:30.751 --> 07:32.986
No. Never even
seen her before.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.556
You know, I felt the bullet
go past my arm.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.257
Why were you standing so close
to her when she was shot?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.726
She was beautiful.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.694
Oh.

07:40.728 --> 07:43.964
Look, I've never been
great with girls IRL,

07:43.997 --> 07:45.699
but when I saw her,
I knew that I needed

07:45.733 --> 07:48.936
to work up the nerve to walk
over and get her phone number.

07:48.969 --> 07:49.970
We were just talking,

07:50.003 --> 07:51.905
and then...
I'm sorry.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.041
So, did anything
stand out to you?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.843
Anything out of the ordinary
before the shooting?

07:55.876 --> 07:58.278
No. Sorry.

07:58.311 --> 08:00.213
It's okay.
Thank you.

08:00.247 --> 08:02.750
If you think of
anything, let us know.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.820
Wait a minute.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.155
It was red.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.857
What was?

08:09.890 --> 08:11.191
Right after it happened,
there was a...

08:11.224 --> 08:13.093
there was a bright flash
of red.

08:13.126 --> 08:16.096
A reflection.

08:16.129 --> 08:18.098
A reflection over there,

08:18.131 --> 08:19.733
behind Lieutenant Elder
on the pool tile?

08:19.767 --> 08:21.001
Yeah.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.102
Yeah, I saw that flash red,

08:22.135 --> 08:23.637
and then it was gone.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.073
I'm sorry, I can't
remember anything else.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.074
No, that was helpful.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.108
Thanks.
Thank you.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.309
So, what do you think?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.779
Laser aiming device
on a sniper rifle?

08:31.812 --> 08:33.180
Yeah, could be.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.916
Ryan's lucky
he didn't get hit.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.152
She was wearing
a red suit, right?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.088
A sighting laser
would also be red,

08:41.121 --> 08:42.723
which explains why
he didn't see it

08:42.756 --> 08:43.724
when he was talking to her.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.859
Yeah.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.028
So Lieutenant Elder
was standing right there,

08:48.061 --> 08:49.329
and Ryan said that
he felt the bullet

08:49.362 --> 08:51.599
pass by his right arm.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.733
And when her body
fell in the water,

08:52.766 --> 08:55.636
he saw the red light
over there.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.841
I'm thinking the sniper was in
that building across the street.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.943
DEEKS:
Wow.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.177
Why would a sniper
go through that much trouble

09:04.211 --> 09:06.847
to kill this victim?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.882
It's not just any victim.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.584
It's a navy lieutenant.

09:10.618 --> 09:11.852
On U.S. soil.
Yeah.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.153
That's...
that's not good.

09:13.186 --> 09:15.188
Not good at all.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.315
Rolled by your house
this morning.

09:43.817 --> 09:45.285
Checking up on me?

09:45.318 --> 09:48.088
No, I figured I'd bring you
a jar of blended dandelions

09:48.121 --> 09:50.023
or elk's heart
or whatever it is
(chuckles)

09:50.057 --> 09:51.224
you have for breakfast
these days.

09:51.258 --> 09:54.027
I'm good on the elk's heart.
Uh-huh.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.129
When were you gonna tell me
about the "for sale" sign?

09:58.165 --> 09:59.266
When it sells.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.734
What, you get
a new place?

10:00.768 --> 10:02.235
I don't think I need
a house anymore.

10:02.269 --> 10:05.005
Wait a second, you were
on me for years

10:05.038 --> 10:06.707
about buying a place.
Yeah, it was good for you.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.008
You needed to
set down some roots.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.744
Yeah, what about you?
I did that.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.646
Now it's time for me
to move on.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.147
What? To where?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.248
I don't know.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.917
If you need a place to stay

10:16.950 --> 10:17.918
while you're figuring
this all out,

10:17.951 --> 10:19.086
I got plenty of room.

10:19.119 --> 10:22.322
There's no big old roots
to clog things up.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.124
I appreciate that.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.398
*

10:36.469 --> 10:38.939
It's where I'd take
the shot from.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.808
(over comm):
Floor's closed for remodeling.

10:40.841 --> 10:43.276
Shooter was pretty smart
to take the shot from there.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.445
I mean, there's no surveillance
in the pool itself,

10:45.478 --> 10:48.015
but I saw cameras
at all the entrances to the pool

10:48.048 --> 10:50.150
and every hallway,
which means there's no way

10:50.183 --> 10:52.119
he can get in and out cleanly.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.090
Lots of privacy for the shooter.

11:01.394 --> 11:05.899
Huh. Not seeing any great angles
to the pool here.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.935
I...

11:09.102 --> 11:11.371
Hold on.

11:11.404 --> 11:13.406
I got the sniper's blind.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.812
Hey, could you stand
on Lieutenant Elder's mark?

11:18.846 --> 11:21.048
DEEKS:
How's that?

11:21.081 --> 11:23.050
Little left.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.756
Your other left, sweetheart.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.992
There. There.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.194
Here? Here?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.029
That's fine. Just...

11:36.063 --> 11:38.331
Wow. Okay.
This wasn't a clean shot.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.200
There are columns
and steel window dividers

11:40.233 --> 11:42.302
to be accounted for,

11:42.335 --> 11:46.373
and a total shot of...
358 yards.

11:46.406 --> 11:50.443
I mean, factor in the wind and
elevation change to target...

11:50.477 --> 11:55.248
So you got two center mass hits,
no misses, from there.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.218
I mean, I got to be honest,
shooter's pretty good.

11:58.251 --> 12:01.354
I'd say better than pretty good.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.057
I think we're dealing
with a professional.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.526
Highly-trained one at that.

12:06.559 --> 12:11.031
(voice breaking):
I know that Naomi had a really
important job with the navy,

12:11.064 --> 12:14.134
but I can't believe that anyone
would want to kill her.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.969
How long
have you known her?

12:16.003 --> 12:18.271
We were college
roommates.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.240
They're like sisters.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.475
Yeah, we all stayed
in San Diego after college,

12:22.509 --> 12:25.312
but Naomi got
transferred to Hawaii,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.247
and Lynn and I moved to L.A.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.883
We saw each other
every chance we got.

12:29.917 --> 12:33.286
She was using our house
as home base for this trip.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.287
She was traveling?

12:34.321 --> 12:37.257
Yeah, local trips, like,
one or two nights each.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.027
Ventura, Carlsbad, Big Bear.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.196
But this morning, last night,
nothing out of the ordinary?

12:43.230 --> 12:46.066
No. Nothing.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.801
She was stoked

12:47.835 --> 12:51.304
'cause she found this incredible
pool to work out in.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.306
She left before the sun came up.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.246
(quietly):
It'll be okay.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.982
Do you mind if we have a look
through Naomi's belongings?

13:02.015 --> 13:03.316
Uh, not at all.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.118
Here, I'll show you guys
the guest room.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.522
SAM: Hang in
there. Just...

13:09.556 --> 13:11.024
Just up there.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.259
Thank you.
Yeah.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.028
HIDOKO:
Commander James Miyazaki
will be on momentarily.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.864
He was Lieutenant Elder's
Elder's department head

13:16.897 --> 13:18.866
at Joint Base
Pearl Harbor-Hickam.

13:18.899 --> 13:20.834
(computer chirps)

13:20.868 --> 13:22.836
Commander Miyazaki,

13:22.870 --> 13:24.337
we are very sorry for your loss.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.106
Thank you, Assistant Director.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.308
I'd like to assist you
in any way that I can.

13:28.341 --> 13:31.879
Commander, as we proceed
with this death investigation,

13:31.912 --> 13:35.248
it is very obvious that
the perpetrator was skilled.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.317
This was not a random killing.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.986
Do you know why
Lieutenant Elder

13:39.019 --> 13:41.154
might have been
a specific target?

13:41.188 --> 13:45.158
When I heard about the murder, I
asked myself the same question.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.328
And no, I don't know why
anyone would want to kill her.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.330
The lieutenant was well liked
on base.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.333
No history of substance abuse,
no debts that we know about.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.068
She was very squared away.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.870
And what about your team's work?

13:56.904 --> 13:59.372
Would she have been exposed
to any foreign threats?

13:59.406 --> 14:03.210
The NCTAMS-PAC is the world's
largest communication station.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.345
A multitude of highly-classified

14:05.378 --> 14:07.347
and politically-sensitive
material passes

14:07.380 --> 14:09.516
through our station every day,

14:09.549 --> 14:11.952
but our work is done quietly
and in the background.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.254
Lieutenant Elder was never
personally at risk.

14:14.287 --> 14:17.157
And was she expected
to do any naval duties

14:17.190 --> 14:18.625
while on the mainland?

14:18.658 --> 14:20.928
She was set to meet
with some defense contractors,

14:20.961 --> 14:22.395
but I had
to cancel those meetings

14:22.429 --> 14:24.364
a few days ago due
to scheduling conflicts.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.067
And we were told
that she was not in possession

14:27.100 --> 14:29.569
of a government computer,
correct?

14:29.602 --> 14:32.105
That's correct. It's still here
at her workstation.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.474
Okay. That's all for now,
Commander.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.410
Please, keep me informed
as the investigation progresses.

14:37.444 --> 14:41.248
I will, and again,
we are sorry for your loss.

14:41.281 --> 14:42.415
Thank you.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.019
Check in with
Callen and Sam

14:46.053 --> 14:48.021
and see if they can
find a personal laptop.

14:48.055 --> 14:50.357
She probably brought
something with her.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.424
Mm-hmm.
Copy that.

14:51.458 --> 14:53.426
KENSI:
No shells,
no footprints.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.429
Yeah, got no water bottles,
not even a Twinkie wrapper.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.298
All right, we've
got to figure out

14:58.331 --> 14:59.599
how the shooter
got out of here.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.436
You think we're ever
gonna hear from Hetty?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.138
Uh...

15:05.172 --> 15:06.306
I... I hope so.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.441
Why did you think
of that right now?

15:08.475 --> 15:10.143
Everything seems so
different without her,

15:10.177 --> 15:11.378
and Granger's gone,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.713
and now we got
Mosley and Hidoko.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.282
Just, you know.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.450
(quietly):
I mean, do you think
she really retired?

15:17.484 --> 15:19.619
No. I mean, I want
to say no, okay?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.354
I don't think that
she would have up and left

15:21.388 --> 15:22.689
without saying anything
to anybody.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.191
Yeah, but it's
different this time.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.959
I mean, she didn't
speak to anybody.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.328
I know. I know. I know.
Things are changing.

15:28.361 --> 15:31.198
Yeah, well, then, maybe we
should take that as a sign.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.966
Sign of what?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.435
Maybe it's... time
to take the next step.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.005
You know, maybe
it's time to take...

15:38.038 --> 15:40.407
Maybe it's time to
take our next step.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.442
I know. I know.
I know. I know. I know.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.145
Yeah, listen, I'm not saying
that you have to quit

15:45.178 --> 15:47.014
this job that you love,
'cause that would be selfish,

15:47.047 --> 15:49.082
and I wouldn't say that.

15:49.116 --> 15:52.085
But maybe it's time...
that I do.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.021
No, because that would be
selfish of me,

15:54.054 --> 15:55.622
and plus, what would you do?

15:55.655 --> 15:58.591
Honestly, I have no idea,
but what I do know is that...

15:58.625 --> 15:59.392
(sighs)

15:59.426 --> 16:01.694
...you know,
whatever job I take,

16:01.728 --> 16:04.031
I'm just not gonna be
coming in contact with people

16:04.064 --> 16:06.366
that are constantly trying
to shoot me.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.002
I just, I can't imagine,

16:09.036 --> 16:12.272
you know, kissing our daughter
good-bye in the morning,

16:12.305 --> 16:13.606
and then we spend the rest
of the day

16:13.640 --> 16:15.308
wondering if one of us
is gonna get shot.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.344
Did you...
did you say daughter?

16:17.377 --> 16:20.580
Did I not mention that before?

16:20.613 --> 16:23.516
Little...
Little Princess Sunshine Deeks?

16:23.550 --> 16:25.618
No.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.487
(laughs)
No.

16:27.520 --> 16:28.388
You don't like that name?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.390
No!
That name's fantastic.

16:30.423 --> 16:32.025
Um, I...
It's my great uncle.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.727
Yeah. No, um,
how about Athena?

16:34.761 --> 16:36.496
Really?
Yes!

16:36.529 --> 16:37.697
Athena?

16:37.730 --> 16:40.300
Lieutenant Elder's department
head doesn't seem to think

16:40.333 --> 16:41.768
she was targeted due to her job.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.370
You're think
we're looking for something

16:43.403 --> 16:45.238
from her personal life?
Maybe.

16:46.273 --> 16:48.575
Check this out.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.211
Three shirts, skirt,
pair of jeans.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.445
Hmm?

16:52.479 --> 16:56.516
Her dress uniform.
Yeah.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.118
Seems to me that a lieutenant
who has a meeting

16:58.151 --> 17:00.187
with defense contractors
might want to bring it.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.688
She would.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.091
There just isn't much here.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.126
Maybe she has a fear
of overpacking.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.369
Check it out.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.140
Does it have
a memory card?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.475
I don't see any.
Hey, Eric?

17:22.509 --> 17:24.077
ERIC (over comms):
Yeah, Callen.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.712
Yeah, I found a gaming device.

17:25.745 --> 17:28.781
It's a... ZM-847?

17:28.815 --> 17:30.583
Oh. That's a powerful one.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.686
Actually, my personal favorite
in the portable gaming space.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.821
CALLEN:
Can you store data on this,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.489
or is it just for playing games?

17:36.523 --> 17:38.658
Mm. Do either of you have one

17:38.691 --> 17:41.494
of those tiny little
Phillips-head screwdrivers?

17:41.528 --> 17:42.595
Yeah, I got one.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.796
Great. See those two screws

17:43.830 --> 17:45.498
on the back? Unscrew 'em.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.466
You serious?

17:46.499 --> 17:47.800
Yeah.

17:47.834 --> 17:50.370
CALLEN:
Very impressive.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.405
I'm prepared.

17:56.209 --> 17:58.378
Great. Now pop open
that back cover.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.348
There should be an internal
microSD slot.

18:02.715 --> 18:05.885
Yup, and it's got a card in it.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.587
Great. Pop that puppy out.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.256
Now all you need is
a place to play it.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.194
Yeah, I might.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.729
Yeah, there's a flat screen.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.279
That's the Chinese border.

18:32.312 --> 18:36.249
These are classified
surveillance briefs.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.485
This thing goes back
for years.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.653
Daily plans,
action reports.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.591
Potential target lists.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.427
There's no way they
let these leave the base.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.598
She either smuggled 'em out,
or she was unknowingly a mule.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.701
Big risk if she
smuggled this out.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.704
It's a risk that
got her killed.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.681
Door.

19:08.715 --> 19:10.517
Shooter ended up here.

19:10.550 --> 19:12.585
Well, if he took
that stairwell.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.721
No. Stairwell was
the best bet. Think about it.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.356
All the floors
were operational,

19:16.389 --> 19:17.924
and he ran the risk
of employees in the elevators.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.592
But you can't stash
the car down here,

19:19.626 --> 19:21.761
because there's cameras at
the exits. He'd know that.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.796
Yeah. Ah.
Yeah.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.332
I'm seeing it.
Doorframe.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.799
So, this is not

19:26.833 --> 19:28.768
just the escape route. This is
how he got in the building.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.803
He taped the latch.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.907
(door squeaks)
Easy.

19:34.941 --> 19:36.943
(Deeks whistles)

19:43.583 --> 19:46.619
Well, somebody went through
here on a motorcycle.

19:46.653 --> 19:50.223
Yeah, it's a great way to escape
traffic if things go sideways.

19:50.257 --> 19:53.360
Just send this
up to Ops.
(cell camera clicks)

19:55.395 --> 19:57.564
Uh, so, I always figured

19:57.597 --> 19:59.832
that your imaginary child
would be a boy.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.968
Oh, no. I mean,
little dudes are cool,

20:02.001 --> 20:05.338
but have you ever seen those
tiny Channel Islands surfboards

20:05.372 --> 20:07.507
in pink with, like,
a little pink wetsuit?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.409
(laughing):
I mean, come on.
Game over.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.643
Sorry to break it to you,

20:10.677 --> 20:11.878
but not all girls
like pink. I didn't.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.880
Hey, that's a shocker.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.916
I'm just saying, I think that I
would be a great mom to a boy.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.918
Good to know.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.821
In this... hypothetical

20:21.854 --> 20:23.856
conversation that we're
having about...
Hypothetical
conversation. Just. No...

20:23.890 --> 20:27.894
...out here today... So...

20:27.927 --> 20:29.862
Good talk.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.664
Castor?
Uh, hey, guys.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.933
This is Naval Intelligence
Officer Frank Peralta.

20:33.966 --> 20:35.502
Thanks for picking him up.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.769
Hi. How are you?
Good day.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.038
Thanks. You, too.
Good to meet you.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.840
Thanks for jumping into this
right away.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.843
Not a problem.
There was over 3.5 gigs of data

20:43.876 --> 20:45.978
on that microSD card,
so I was only able

20:46.012 --> 20:48.381
to go through a small portion
of the documents.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.450
What'd you find?
You guys were right.

20:50.483 --> 20:51.884
Lieutenant Elder
was in possession

20:51.918 --> 20:54.554
of highly classified
surveillance practices,

20:54.587 --> 20:56.856
results, targets
and schedules.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.591
Now, this information did go

20:58.625 --> 21:00.026
through Joint Base
Pearl Harbor-Hickam,

21:00.059 --> 21:02.929
but it's still unclear if she
even had access to this stuff.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.598
What's the value of this
information on the open market?

21:05.632 --> 21:07.634
High value.
If the Chinese found out

21:07.667 --> 21:09.302
about our entire
surveillance operation,

21:09.336 --> 21:11.704
we'd have massive
national security issues.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.005
All right.
Well, let's say she didn't

21:13.039 --> 21:14.807
unknowingly transport this,

21:14.841 --> 21:16.943
but she smuggled it out with
the intent to sell the intel.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.611
Who's the most likely buyer?

21:18.645 --> 21:20.046
Multiple interested parties.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.881
In fact, she'd probably
have a bidding war

21:21.914 --> 21:23.516
if that's the route she took.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.419
Multiple parties interested
in the same information.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.321
That could explain
why she was killed.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.390
Yeah. When I was scanning
the SD card,

21:30.423 --> 21:33.493
I discovered one copy was made
yesterday, around noon.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.061
That could be the copy
she was gonna sell.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.529
Or already sold.

21:36.563 --> 21:37.764
Well, whoever killed her,

21:37.797 --> 21:39.031
they're the key to finding
that copy.

21:39.065 --> 21:40.933
Well, I don't have to tell you

21:40.967 --> 21:44.371
that we need to get
that copy back... immediately.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.609
Kensi and Deeks got
a pretty good image

21:49.642 --> 21:51.344
of the motorcycle tire track,

21:51.378 --> 21:52.845
but it hasn't been easy
to match.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.547
System's still running it.

21:54.581 --> 21:56.883
She's too...

21:56.916 --> 21:58.618
I don't know, nice?

21:58.651 --> 22:01.454
Whatever it is,
I don't like it.

22:01.488 --> 22:03.856
Nice? I would not
call her nice.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.392
Pleasant, maybe.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.826
She practically ran out
of the shooting range

22:06.859 --> 22:08.094
when I went
to go get her.

22:08.127 --> 22:09.429
Yeah, exactly.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.830
Wait. What?

22:10.863 --> 22:11.998
Today.

22:12.031 --> 22:12.932
This morning.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.401
I went to go get her
at the shooting range...

22:14.434 --> 22:15.568
Hold on.

22:15.602 --> 22:16.636
Who are you talking about?

22:16.669 --> 22:18.070
Who are you
talking about?

22:18.104 --> 22:19.439
Mosley.

22:19.472 --> 22:20.840
I was talking about Harley.

22:20.873 --> 22:24.944
Oh, I like Mosley.
Oh, I like Harley.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.146
Interesting.
(computer beeps)

22:27.179 --> 22:28.615
Hey.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.983
Looks like Kensi and Deeks

22:31.017 --> 22:34.454
are looking for the 2017
KTM Duke motorcycle.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.489
The tread matches the
factory installed tires.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.090
Nice work.

22:38.124 --> 22:39.592
All right.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.061
Now I'll do a search
for any KTM bike

22:42.094 --> 22:46.466
within four blocks of the
Aquatic Center within an hour

22:46.499 --> 22:49.502
of the shooting.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.137
Got one.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.606
Just two blocks from
the Aquatic Center,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.842
eight minutes
after the shooting.

22:55.875 --> 22:59.712
Now let's try to find
this specific bike, huh?

22:59.746 --> 23:01.080
Hey, is that him?

23:01.113 --> 23:02.148
What?

23:02.181 --> 23:03.616
Holy...

23:03.650 --> 23:05.151
We just got lucky.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.153
No. That's wasn't luck.

23:07.186 --> 23:11.090
Hey, Deeks, it looks like
the bike you're looking for

23:11.123 --> 23:14.026
was spotted just outside of
downtown in an industrial area.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.028
We are sending the
locations to your phone now.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.631
Got it. Thanks, Nell.

23:22.702 --> 23:24.604
Sorry we had to bring another
unit in to search the place.

23:24.637 --> 23:26.172
Of course. I
don't mind at all.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.007
Whatever you need to do to find
whoever did this to Naomi.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.041
Yeah. How's your wife doing?

23:29.075 --> 23:30.943
She's lying down.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.745
I don't think everything's
really hit her yet.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.481
Yeah. You said they
were like sisters.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.948
Very close.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.217
Uh, I tried to
talk to her.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.019
See if she'd
spoken with Naomi,

23:40.052 --> 23:42.154
if there was anything...

23:42.188 --> 23:43.790
She's not ready
to talk yet.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.625
You don't happen to know
where Lieutenant Elder was

23:45.658 --> 23:47.093
yesterday around noon, do you?

23:47.126 --> 23:50.863
No. Uh, uh, she wasn't here.

23:50.897 --> 23:52.098
I didn't see her
till dinnertime.

23:52.131 --> 23:54.033
Okay.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.201
I'm gonna go check
on my partner.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.837
You know, um...

23:57.870 --> 24:01.107
after you left, I was
thinking through everything.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.877
Uh, Naomi's whole trip out
here... everything.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.713
Uh...
Anything out
of the ordinary?

24:06.746 --> 24:09.782
Uh... no actions.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.083
Nothing I could point to

24:11.117 --> 24:14.086
and say it was
out of character, but...

24:14.120 --> 24:15.087
(scoffs)

24:15.121 --> 24:16.088
You know, it's probably nothing.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.990
Anything would help.

24:20.192 --> 24:22.194
She seemed...

24:22.228 --> 24:24.230
I don't know, distracted.

24:24.263 --> 24:27.033
Like, uh, she was
waiting on something.

24:27.066 --> 24:29.869
And...

24:29.902 --> 24:33.806
Uh, I couldn't really
talk to her.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.842
Everything was on
a surface level,

24:35.875 --> 24:38.044
very vague, uh...

24:38.077 --> 24:41.514
Her workouts, Lynn's art...

24:41.548 --> 24:45.618
I don't want to say secretive,
but...

24:45.652 --> 24:47.887
Anyway, I thought,
I thought I should tell you.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.991
Appreciate it.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.059
Yeah.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.999
If those classified
documents are in that house,

25:00.032 --> 25:01.200
that team will find it.

25:01.233 --> 25:02.669
If a physical copy
still exists.

25:02.702 --> 25:03.870
It could be up
in a cloud by now.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.104
Yeah, but the only
way to find out

25:05.137 --> 25:07.173
if it exists or where
is to find the buyers.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.975
Well, Eric went through
texts, e-mails,

25:09.008 --> 25:10.142
personal phone records.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.978
He didn't find
anything he could use.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.013
Yeah. He also checked
the social media.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.182
She posted about the
trip this past week.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.917
What platform is she on?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.285
Uh, Facebook
and Instagram.

25:19.318 --> 25:20.553
She's more active
on Instagram.

25:20.587 --> 25:21.688
She has a public account.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.255
She posts a lot of pics.

25:23.289 --> 25:26.659
Oh. A public account
on Instagram means anyone

25:26.693 --> 25:29.195
can access your photos
and post comments.

25:29.228 --> 25:30.863
Yeah.

25:30.897 --> 25:33.132
Remember those old stories
about people communicating

25:33.165 --> 25:35.234
through classified ads
in newspapers?

25:35.267 --> 25:36.235
Yeah.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.237
Well, what if she was using
the comment section

25:38.270 --> 25:39.906
of her Instagram account

25:39.939 --> 25:41.674
to communicate
with buyers?

25:43.643 --> 25:44.811
Hey, Eric.

25:44.844 --> 25:45.978
ERIC:
Hey, Callen.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.179
I need you to access

25:47.213 --> 25:49.248
Lieutenant Elder's
Instagram account.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.183
I want to see if she was
communicating with anybody

25:51.217 --> 25:52.885
through the comments section.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.655
Uh-huh, checking now.

25:55.688 --> 26:00.126
Okay. There is one profile,
uh, TO805,

26:00.159 --> 26:02.161
that's been interacting a ton

26:02.194 --> 26:04.163
with Lieutenant Elder's posts,

26:04.196 --> 26:06.265
like, 20 in the last week alone.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.200
You have an ID
on that account?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.770
ERIC:
Yeah. Running ISP records now.

26:10.803 --> 26:12.605
(clicking tongue)
Yeah.

26:12.639 --> 26:15.207
The account belongs to
Geno Preston.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.143
He's local, L.A.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.277
Nice work, Eric.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.211
Send us the address.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.280
ERIC:
Copy that.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.715
What?

26:22.749 --> 26:24.751
Instagram comments?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.919
They have a lot of good
E.D.C. products on there.

26:26.953 --> 26:28.354
Oh, you're a book of
a thousand secrets, huh?

26:28.387 --> 26:29.355
Mm-hmm.

26:29.388 --> 26:32.191
Tell ya a few.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.926
Eric, we're down
in this area,

26:33.960 --> 26:35.762
but there's about a million
places to hide down here.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.063
Is there any way
you could possibly

26:37.096 --> 26:38.264
narrow down that search?

26:38.297 --> 26:40.700
I've only got that one angle

26:40.733 --> 26:42.669
on the motorcycle entering
the industrial area,

26:42.702 --> 26:44.671
but I'm searching other
traffic cameras now.

26:44.704 --> 26:47.339
KENSI:
All right, you got it.
Thank you.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.122
*

27:05.324 --> 27:06.325
G.

27:13.432 --> 27:15.634
(creaks softly)

27:23.409 --> 27:25.411
In position.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.115
Going in the front door.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.277
Bedroom's clear.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.016
I've got Preston.

28:22.001 --> 28:24.070
LAPD and the
coroner are en route.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.905
Preston was tortured

28:25.938 --> 28:27.840
before they killed him.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.208
Whoever searched
this place was trained.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.978
I mean, they went
through everything.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.246
Well, the logical timeline
is they tortured him,

28:34.280 --> 28:36.248
they killed him, then
they searched the place.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.884
Yeah, well, if that holds,

28:37.917 --> 28:40.119
then he either didn't know
where the stolen intel is,

28:40.152 --> 28:41.921
or he didn't want
to tell them.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.093
This place doesn't scream
international spy.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.061
Yeah, but what
house ever does?
Yours.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.830
(chuckles)

28:52.098 --> 28:54.000
Funny.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.803
Ah.

28:56.836 --> 28:57.937
Here we go.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.772
Looks like Lieutenant Elder

28:59.806 --> 29:01.273
and Preston were in
a relationship.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.442
This picture's got to be
about two years old.

29:03.475 --> 29:07.146
Yeah, well, I got her
dress uniform in here.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.149
And her toiletries
in the bathroom.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.190
Okay. So Elder wasn't going
to Ventura or Carlsbad,

29:18.224 --> 29:20.026
or taking short trips.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.160
She was here with Preston.

29:21.193 --> 29:23.796
Stiger never said anything
about her having a boyfriend.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.865
Maybe staying here
was just a cover.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.900
Was he an innocent boyfriend?

29:27.934 --> 29:30.002
Or was he a player
working with her?

29:30.036 --> 29:33.072
Well, either way, he ended up
dead, just like she did.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.845
Whoo, found the motorcycle.

29:38.878 --> 29:39.979
Hey, nice work.

29:40.012 --> 29:42.014
Thanks.

29:42.048 --> 29:44.050
There are no building
numbers in this footage,

29:44.083 --> 29:46.052
and everything looks the same
in this industrial section.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.220
NELL:
Yeah. Wait a second.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.422
What's that?

29:50.456 --> 29:52.424
W-G-D.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.962
There's a Westside Graphic
Design listed right there.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.064
Nice. Okay, Kens.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.365
Yeah, what's up, Nell?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.834
So the last known location
of the motorcycle

30:01.868 --> 30:03.602
was near this
ten-story building.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.938
I believe it's just
on your right.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.040
All right. We're
heading in there now.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.613
Will your new office
be Hetty's old office?

30:14.646 --> 30:17.283
(laughs)
This is hardly an office,

30:17.316 --> 30:19.485
it's more like an alcove.

30:19.518 --> 30:22.621
I don't think there's a
decent office in this space.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.923
It's an interesting
building.

30:23.956 --> 30:24.957
I kind of like it.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.126
Yeah. I don't know.
I just thought everything

30:27.159 --> 30:30.029
in Los Angeles was
supposed to be new and fresh.

30:30.062 --> 30:33.099
This place even smells old.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.902
Hmm. Well, Henrietta made do,
adapted to the building.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.971
Well, I have a crew coming
to build me my own office.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.907
The building can adapt to me.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.041
And I don't
think Henrietta

30:42.074 --> 30:43.309
was the type
of person to adapt.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.078
I think she knew exactly
what she was doing.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.414
She wanted her team
accessible to her at all times,

30:48.447 --> 30:50.616
and her accessible
to her team.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.151
Makes sense.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.320
Yeah. Do you have
a sitrep for me?

30:54.353 --> 30:56.522
Yes, ma'am. Callen
and Sam believe

30:56.555 --> 30:58.390
that Lieutenant Elder
was involved

30:58.424 --> 31:00.059
with a man
named Geno Preston.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.094
Kensi and Deeks
tracked the motorcycle

31:02.128 --> 31:03.529
they believe belongs
to the sniper

31:03.562 --> 31:05.464
to an industrial park
in the downtown...

31:05.497 --> 31:06.999
How do they work together?

31:07.033 --> 31:10.002
Elder and Preston
or Callen and Sam?

31:10.036 --> 31:12.038
All of them,
these guys, the team.

31:12.071 --> 31:14.440
HIDOKO:
Seamlessly.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.675
So do you think it would be
a mistake to break them up?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.945
Is that still the plan?

31:18.978 --> 31:20.179
Yes.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.213
Plans change.

31:21.247 --> 31:23.415
Some do, some don't.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.451
(car approaching)

31:37.663 --> 31:39.665
(distant engine revs)
Kens.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.238
(engine revving)
(gunfire)

31:57.583 --> 31:58.584
KENSI:
Get in, Deeks!

32:00.219 --> 32:01.187
Go!

32:01.220 --> 32:02.188
Go!

32:02.221 --> 32:05.124
(shouts)
Son of a bitch!

32:05.457 --> 32:06.592
Go, go, go!

32:08.327 --> 32:10.997
(tires screeching)

32:14.533 --> 32:16.402
(tires screech)

32:21.040 --> 32:22.641
(tires screech)

32:22.674 --> 32:24.676
(Deeks grunting)

32:27.179 --> 32:29.548
DEEKS:
There's no way out.

32:29.581 --> 32:30.682
They're gonna
come right at us.

32:30.716 --> 32:32.351
Watch your eyes.
(grunts)

32:33.519 --> 32:35.287
(grunts)
There we go.

32:35.321 --> 32:36.989
(revving)

32:37.023 --> 32:38.457
Go!

32:45.597 --> 32:46.165
Oh!

32:49.435 --> 32:51.237
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

32:51.270 --> 32:53.772
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.
What? What, what, what?

32:53.805 --> 32:56.108
Engine's dead.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.310
Wow.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.047
Yeah, that's not good
for the resale.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.314
Hey.

33:02.348 --> 33:05.317
I really wish we could've worked
out our differences with words.

33:07.686 --> 33:10.389
Do we have an identification
on the shooters?

33:10.422 --> 33:12.658
Yep. We've got them entering
the country at LAX last week.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.327
Looks like they were traveling
on fake passports

33:15.361 --> 33:18.130
under the names
of recently deceased men.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.299
MOSLEY: Classy. What else
do we know about these guys?

33:20.332 --> 33:21.033
NELL:
Well, their flights to L.A.

33:21.067 --> 33:23.235
originated in
the Philippines,

33:23.269 --> 33:26.172
but it looks like they flew
there from Shenzhen, China.

33:26.205 --> 33:29.141
ERIC: So these guys came
into L.A. to either do a deal

33:29.175 --> 33:31.810
with Lieutenant Elder
for the stolen intel

33:31.843 --> 33:33.245
or just to kill her?

33:33.279 --> 33:35.247
If they came just to kill her,

33:35.281 --> 33:37.316
it's becoming apparent that
she was in business with them

33:37.349 --> 33:38.350
prior to this.

33:40.219 --> 33:43.055
(indistinct radio chatter)

33:43.089 --> 33:44.323
You guys okay?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.291
Yeah.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.458
Yeah. No, we're good.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.626
Car's dead, though.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.462
Your new car is dead?

33:50.496 --> 33:52.264
Okay, first of all,
the car's not dead,

33:52.298 --> 33:53.599
it's a little dinged up.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.667
A little dinged up? Really?
And second of all,

33:55.701 --> 33:57.603
it's not new.
We've had it for a year.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.271
Well, a year
is still kind of new.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.207
I mean, what have we had
the Challenger? Five years?

34:02.241 --> 34:03.742
We got a new one last year.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.378
What?

34:06.412 --> 34:07.746
I didn't notice.

34:07.779 --> 34:09.348
ERIC: Guys, I got
a hit on the third motorcycle.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.084
It's exiting the 101
on Silver Lake Boulevard.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.785
They're headed
to the Stigers' house.

34:13.819 --> 34:15.187
We're on it.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.688
Sir, we need to commandeer
that vehicle.

34:30.869 --> 34:32.671
There's the bike.

34:49.655 --> 34:51.657
(gunshot in distance)

35:15.947 --> 35:18.150
(quietly):
Entering through the front.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.662
LYNN: Help!
Help us!

35:30.696 --> 35:32.531
Help us, please!
Help-- Keith's shot.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.566
He's up there. He's-- he...
How many are here?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.202
I don't know. He's shot. We...
Shh. Listen to me.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.936
Listen to me.
How many people are up there?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.571
I don't know, uh, j-just one.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.374
H-He... we-- he just walked
in. We were watching TV.

35:42.408 --> 35:43.609
Go, go with them.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.511
Sam? There's one shooter inside.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.778
He took out Keith Stiger.
I'm going up.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.732
(gunfire continues)

36:25.717 --> 36:27.686
(groaning)

36:27.719 --> 36:29.621
I got Keith Stiger.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.861
Eric, I need an ambulance.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.429
You're okay, I got you.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.767
Where's Lynn?
She's okay. She's coming.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.335
(shouts)

36:43.369 --> 36:44.703
She's okay.
Hi-- oh, no.

36:44.736 --> 36:46.638
Please-- Keith.
Please, help him.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.873
KENSI: An ambulance
is on the way.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.608
(Keith grunting)
LYNN: Oh, God.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.610
Why is this happening?
A-Are you okay,
are you hurt?

36:51.643 --> 36:52.811
No, I-I'm fine.

36:52.844 --> 36:53.979
God.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.314
(Keith groaning)

36:55.347 --> 36:56.782
It's okay. You're safe now.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.384
You're safe.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.718
Thank you.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.653
I don't know how to repay you,
but I will.

37:01.687 --> 37:03.989
Just take it easy until
the ambulance gets here.

37:04.022 --> 37:05.624
You're okay.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.627
Take it slow.
Are you okay?

37:08.660 --> 37:10.662
(Keith panting)

37:13.465 --> 37:15.834
14 different
forms. Really?

37:15.867 --> 37:18.003
It takes 14 forms for
them to fix our car?

37:18.036 --> 37:20.005
Yeah, there are lot
of bullet holes in it.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.607
It needs a new windshield.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.041
Engine took some rounds, too.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.444
Right. Exactly. So
that's like a five-form

37:25.477 --> 37:27.613
filler-upper fixer-outer, tops.

37:27.646 --> 37:30.616
MOSLEY: Or we don't have to fix
your car at all, we can just

37:30.649 --> 37:31.950
pull an old Caprice
from the motor pool.

37:31.983 --> 37:35.587
Oh. No, no. 'Cause
we like our car.

37:35.621 --> 37:37.589
Actually, we love my car.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.558
(chuckles)
Like what you've done
with the place.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.792
Well, it's a work in progress.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.794
So, uh, after, uh,
the federal K-9 unit

37:42.828 --> 37:44.796
went through the Stigers' house,

37:44.830 --> 37:46.064
they went through Preston's.

37:46.097 --> 37:50.436
And, uh, they found a duffle bag
with a $100,000 in cash in it.

37:50.469 --> 37:51.870
Intelligence
at Pearl Harbor-Hickam

37:51.903 --> 37:55.040
found a cloud account set up
in Lieutenant Elder's name.

37:55.073 --> 37:58.043
A copy of all of the classified
intel was there.

37:58.076 --> 38:01.847
So Lieutenant Elder had the
classified intel and the cash.

38:01.880 --> 38:02.848
Correct.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.816
So it looks like Preston
and Elder really were

38:04.850 --> 38:06.685
trying to double-cross
the Chinese, huh?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.854
Mm, didn't turn out
too well for them.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.423
Do we know if this
is an isolated incident

38:11.457 --> 38:12.924
restricted to Lieutenant Elder,

38:12.958 --> 38:15.394
or if this was part
of a larger espionage ring?

38:15.427 --> 38:16.862
That isn't clear yet.

38:16.895 --> 38:20.332
Because all of Lieutenant
Elder's killers ended up dead.

38:20.366 --> 38:21.600
Yes.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.972
See, when I said
this team was good

38:27.005 --> 38:28.507
but that it could be better,

38:28.540 --> 38:31.543
this is the exact instance
that I was speaking of.

38:31.577 --> 38:34.480
This isn't over for us.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.682
We follow up on every case
and every lead.

38:36.715 --> 38:38.384
Hetty used to support that.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.685
Hmm.
That's why we've had
the long-term success

38:39.718 --> 38:40.886
that we've had.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.988
Lovely.

38:43.021 --> 38:46.525
I'm going back to Washington
for a meeting.

38:46.558 --> 38:48.026
I'm taking Harley with me.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.761
Meetings about us?

38:51.697 --> 38:54.466
Agent Hanna, not everything
is about you.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.802
Just please, try not
to burn the building down

38:56.835 --> 38:58.904
while I'm gone.

38:58.937 --> 38:59.938
That's it.

38:59.971 --> 39:01.773
Ma'am.
Director.

39:01.807 --> 39:02.774
Understood.

39:02.808 --> 39:06.845
So, when you say
that we're all done for today,

39:06.878 --> 39:08.514
does that mean that we're all...

39:08.547 --> 39:10.115
What I mean is you can
fill out the motor pool forms

39:10.148 --> 39:11.483
tomorrow morning.

39:11.517 --> 39:12.751
Right. Just to clarify,

39:12.784 --> 39:16.822
so, by "tomorrow morning," you
mean that I still have a job?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.791
What I mean is
this conversation is over.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.393
For the love of God, let's go.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.429
Yeah, no. Good talk. Go team.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.510
(engine shuts off)

39:44.550 --> 39:46.585
I hope you're gonna tell me that
Hetty moved her boat down here

39:46.618 --> 39:48.620
and she's living on it
happily ever after.

39:52.924 --> 39:54.926
If you think I'm going
spearfishing with you tonight,

39:54.960 --> 39:55.827
you're dreaming. Have you seen

39:55.861 --> 39:57.796
how many shark
sightings there's been?

39:57.829 --> 39:59.665
You don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.899
Yeah, that's one school
of thought. The other one is,

40:00.932 --> 40:02.701
I stay on dry land,

40:02.734 --> 40:04.035
I don't get eaten
by a great white.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.738
I'm not going
spearfishing tonight.

40:06.772 --> 40:10.208
There's a big swell,
the water's too cloudy.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.579
Again I ask, what
are we doing here?

40:13.612 --> 40:15.881
You're gonna help me
move in my new place,

40:15.914 --> 40:18.049
and I'm gonna buy you a beer.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.920
You're gonna live on a boat?

40:21.953 --> 40:25.023
I do better on the water.

40:25.056 --> 40:28.093
Did you already move in
the rest of your stuff?

40:28.126 --> 40:29.795
This is all of it.
That's it?

40:29.828 --> 40:31.029
That's it.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.430
Huh.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.868
There she is.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.138
CALLEN:
Well, it floats.

40:40.171 --> 40:41.873
I mean, you got that
going for you.

40:41.907 --> 40:44.910
It'll take a minute to get her
in shipshape condition.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.679
It's gonna take a lot of
time and a lot of work.

40:47.713 --> 40:50.916
I don't mind.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.584
Eh, it's actually
not that bad.

40:52.618 --> 40:53.885
We can work with her.

40:53.919 --> 40:54.953
"We"?

40:54.986 --> 40:58.957
Yeah. My inspiration, my
vision, your sweat equity.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.526
She'll be the prettiest boat
on the dock.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.960
SAM: Sweat equity, huh?
Mm-hmm.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.795
What is it,
The Clam Bake?

41:03.829 --> 41:05.997
Uh-uh.
Guess it's got a ring to it.

41:06.031 --> 41:09.568
I'm gonna call her Michelle.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.870
When she's ready,
me and the kids

41:11.903 --> 41:13.171
are gonna take her up to Carmel.

41:13.204 --> 41:14.706
Michelle loved it up there.

41:14.740 --> 41:17.909
I'm gonna sprinkle
her ashes in the water.

41:22.013 --> 41:25.984
What do you say we dump that bag
onboard, go grab that beer?

41:29.054 --> 41:31.056
Sounds good.

41:31.089 --> 41:33.559
Let's do it.
