WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.675
* I plot *

00:09.210 --> 00:12.080
* Your rubric scarab *

00:13.781 --> 00:15.216
* I steal *

00:15.283 --> 00:18.219
Before you say anything,
it's like a family heirloom

00:18.286 --> 00:20.054
and it still drives really well.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.391
* I want *

00:23.457 --> 00:26.026
Can't see Matthew driving
to work in this.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.296
No, he's desperate for an Audi.

00:29.330 --> 00:33.267
* Baby tonight baby tonight *

00:33.334 --> 00:35.035
Did you ever have a pony?

00:36.637 --> 00:37.905
Why?

00:37.971 --> 00:40.774
This feels like a Land Rover
that's done a lot of gymkhanas.

00:40.841 --> 00:44.478
* And you know
I will not apologize *

00:44.545 --> 00:46.080
You sure you don't
want me to come?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.116
The client's asked
to see me alone.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.185
* I'm makin' a career of evil *

00:51.252 --> 00:52.420
Thanks for the ride.

00:52.486 --> 00:56.290
* I'm makin' a career of evil *

00:56.357 --> 01:00.094
* I'm makin a career of evil **

01:03.164 --> 01:04.598
Sorry I'm late. Work.

01:04.665 --> 01:06.867
Oh, does he keep you
out late every night?

01:06.934 --> 01:10.070
Thanks. Uh, w-we're just busy
at the moment.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.040
- Uh.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.708
- No, I've gone full-time.
- Yeah.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.810
But she's paid less than when
she was earning agency fees.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.946
Well, money's not everything.

01:27.988 --> 01:30.691
He's a bit beaten-up looking,
but then that looks good

01:30.758 --> 01:32.760
on some men, doesn't it?
Looking a bit used.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.928
You know, most of us chaps are
a bit secondhand at this point.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.531
I guess second leg might be
higher up Cormoran's list.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.509
Is it still just the two
of you in the office?

01:48.576 --> 01:50.344
Oh, well, he's out
most of the time.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.580
So, Sarah,
how's your work going?

02:19.573 --> 02:21.542
'Doors opening.'

02:24.778 --> 02:26.447
'Doors closing.'

02:42.763 --> 02:44.198
Hello?

02:54.308 --> 02:56.244
* You and me *

02:57.378 --> 03:00.214
* Me and you *

03:00.281 --> 03:04.885
* Somehow we make it through *

03:06.587 --> 03:09.056
* I may be gone *

03:09.122 --> 03:11.592
* I may be far away *

03:13.294 --> 03:16.530
* But I'll walk beside you *

03:16.597 --> 03:20.701
* Every step of the way *

03:20.768 --> 03:25.373
* When you're used bruised *

03:25.439 --> 03:27.608
* Black and blue *

03:27.675 --> 03:30.811
* Don't think about it *

03:32.346 --> 03:34.748
* Never doubt it *

03:34.815 --> 03:38.552
* I'll walk beside you **

03:57.871 --> 03:59.740
Strike..

04:03.110 --> 04:04.912
Oh.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.481
Hello. Cormoran Strike?

04:07.548 --> 04:09.950
Oh, Ellacott, that's me.

04:19.293 --> 04:22.296
- Hiya.
'

04:22.363 --> 04:24.498
Bills, mostly.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.534
Have you, uh,
picked up your e

04:26.600 --> 04:28.602
There's a new client request.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.804
Thinks his girlfriend
is cheating.

04:30.871 --> 04:33.407
- Oh.

04:33.474 --> 04:34.708
- I'm not sure we've got time.
- Thanks.

04:34.775 --> 04:37.210
She's a LSE student
and a part-time stripper

04:37.277 --> 04:39.012
on Tottenham Court Road.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.948
I suppose it depends
on how often she's cheating.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.983
I'll call him now
and give him our rates.

04:45.653 --> 04:47.154
Cormoran Strike's office.
Robin speaking.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.922
'You sent us
an e-mail enquiry..'

04:48.989 --> 04:51.492
Oh, hello, yes. Thank you
very much for calling back.

04:51.559 --> 04:54.094
So, we really like
the salmon for starter

04:54.161 --> 04:57.297
and then the beef for main,
but we thought maybe risotto

04:57.365 --> 04:59.199
is a little bit boring
for vegetarian?

04:59.266 --> 05:00.634
Where's she working now?

05:00.701 --> 05:02.903
Well, there's ten in total

05:02.970 --> 05:05.773
but three are vegan
and one is Paleo vegan.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.643
'Uh, yeah, no,
I'll put my team onto it.'

05:09.710 --> 05:11.612
I suppose we could do

05:11.679 --> 05:14.314
with and without cheese?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.016
'And what's her name?'

05:24.057 --> 05:26.193
Uh, can I call you back?

05:26.259 --> 05:27.995
'Cheers.'

05:28.061 --> 05:29.430
'Robin?'

05:58.759 --> 05:59.593
You okay?

05:59.660 --> 06:01.662
I'm fine.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.872
We'll, uh, get back to you.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.147
- 'We've been sent a leg.'

06:24.518 --> 06:27.821
- It's not even in my size.

06:27.888 --> 06:30.257
'Right, I'm on my way.'

06:31.659 --> 06:34.127
Cup of tea? Or something
stronger. I've got beer.

06:34.194 --> 06:36.864
- Tea sounds good.
- I'll put the kettle on.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.876
- Don't touch it.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.154
You've gone white.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.162
'Whose leg did you
think it was?'

07:10.464 --> 07:12.399
- I don't know.
- Well, you might know.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.702
But something occurred to you.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.737
What were you thinking?

07:18.639 --> 07:21.074
There was a scar.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.776
An old scar.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.345
I'd say the leg belongs
to somebody in their teens

07:25.412 --> 07:27.815
maybe their early 20s.

07:27.881 --> 07:31.218
And I've seen scarring
like that before.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.855
It might be a girl
called Brittany Brockbank.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.791
Her father
was Major Noel Brockbank.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.393
He had a reputation
for cruelty.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.829
Brittany told a school friend

07:41.895 --> 07:44.297
that Brockbank
was having sex with her

07:44.364 --> 07:46.800
and she was worried
she might get pregnant.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.603
The friend's dad told SIB,
so I was there

07:49.670 --> 07:52.840
as the investigating officer
when she was interviewed.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.643
The poor thing denied
everything, of course.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.277
She must've been terrified.

07:57.344 --> 08:00.247
Brockbank had threatened
to cut her legs off

08:00.313 --> 08:02.015
if anyone found out.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.685
The scars were his idea
of a warning.

08:04.752 --> 08:08.188
I made it all up.
It was a joke.

08:11.525 --> 08:14.194
'Has your dad
ever threatened to hurt you?'

08:16.830 --> 08:18.832
Daddy wouldn't do that.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.269
I didn't mean any of it.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.075
'If you want to tell me
anything, Brittany'

08:28.141 --> 08:29.610
'you can.'

08:31.845 --> 08:35.515
'
- No charges brought.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.017
But he still has good reason
to hate me.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.820
- He thinks I injured him.

08:41.454 --> 08:44.024
His arrest went badly.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.326
'The only other man who's
sick enough and hates me enough'

08:46.393 --> 08:49.730
to send me a leg is this Scot
called Donald Laing.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.632
'He used to write me
threatening letters.'

08:51.699 --> 08:53.066
'They'll be on file somewhere.'

08:53.133 --> 08:54.134
I'll get crackin'.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.237
No, we're just arriving.
Forensics are here.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.146
A fuckin' leg?

09:07.514 --> 09:08.749
'What about the bike?'

09:08.816 --> 09:10.417
'It was a black Honda. Big.'

09:10.483 --> 09:12.352
'Six hundred cc at least.'

09:12.419 --> 09:14.154
'The courier
was in black leathers.'

09:14.221 --> 09:17.057
His helmet had a dark visor
and he kept it down.

09:17.124 --> 09:20.661
He looked big, but the jacket
could've just padded him up.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.830
Not a fat bastard
like the boss.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.497
- Yeah.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.099
Oh, it was addressed to me.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.500
'This could just be
them demonstrating'

09:27.567 --> 09:29.002
they've done their homework.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.137
Any ideas?

09:30.203 --> 09:32.239
I think there's something
underneath it.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.007
It could be a note.

09:44.952 --> 09:48.488
"A harvest of limbs,
of arms and of legs.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.157
The toes that crawl,
the knees--"

09:50.223 --> 09:52.059
'"The knees that jerk,
the necks like swans'

09:52.125 --> 09:55.262
that seem to turn
as if inclined to gasp or pray."

09:56.864 --> 09:58.832
Last verse of
"Mistress Of The Salmon Salt"

09:58.899 --> 10:01.001
by Blue Oyster Cult.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.169
You a fan?

10:02.235 --> 10:04.905
They were my mum's
favorite band.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.607
She had that particular
song title..

10:09.342 --> 10:10.944
...tattooed.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.781
- Whitechapel Cemetery.

10:15.315 --> 10:18.451
Her second husband killed her.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.821
Never went down for it though.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.622
Jeff Whittaker.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.079
Who do you reckon
left that one then?

10:46.146 --> 10:47.580
'It was probably Uncle Ted.'

10:47.647 --> 10:48.949
'That's an Erica carnea.'

10:49.016 --> 10:51.819
Or it was before winter
in Whitechapel.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.721
He grows 'em.

10:59.426 --> 11:02.930
I don't know what those are.
Garage had it on sale.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.002
How's your stump then?

11:09.069 --> 11:12.072
You're like an old relative.
You don't have to ask after it.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.316
Top girl, your mum.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.117
Thanks.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.857
Sorry.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.532
So...it was addressed to you.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.501
Mm.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.237
But meant for Strike, obviously.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.672
A severed woman's leg
was sent to you

12:19.739 --> 12:21.775
and for what?

12:21.842 --> 12:24.912
Slightly less
than the minimum wage?

12:24.978 --> 12:28.481
Would it be alright
if I was earning 100 grand?

12:28.548 --> 12:31.318
How many share options
make a girl's severed limb

12:31.384 --> 12:33.086
worth me dealing with?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.191
I've got work to do.

12:41.361 --> 12:44.031
You up for killing
Whittaker yet?

12:44.097 --> 12:46.766
Still a no from me.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.838
I need you to find him though.
That's why I wanted to see you.

12:50.904 --> 12:53.907
I received a severed leg
in this morning's post

12:53.974 --> 12:57.044
with some
Blue Oyster Cult lyrics.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.079
He holds grudges.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.981
This feels like him.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.950
Police are looking,
but they won't find him.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.118
Oh, he's probably
squattin' somewhere

13:05.185 --> 13:07.988
with some shitty
band and all.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.690
It was addressed to my partner.

13:10.757 --> 13:13.360
- 'Exactly.'

13:13.426 --> 13:15.162
So work fast.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.873
Hey, Rob?

13:30.710 --> 13:32.846
Rob, Rob, Rob.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.453
Jesus, that sound
you were making..

13:40.520 --> 13:41.922
What sound?

13:43.056 --> 13:46.259
You're doing
what you used to do.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.032
Look, we're gettin' married.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.935
But seeing you in this state..

13:56.136 --> 13:58.906
It's not good for you
and you know that.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.874
I'm fine.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.275
Honestly.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.158
I'm sure Strike's delighted.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.397
What are you talking about?

14:24.464 --> 14:27.100
Well, he's gonna make a pass
at you at some point.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.768
And you're just getting
worked up into this state--

14:28.835 --> 14:32.839
He won't, and I'd be perfectly
capable of shoving him off.

14:32.906 --> 14:35.075
- Of course you would.
- Ugh!

14:35.142 --> 14:36.743
Jesus, what is wrong with you?

14:36.809 --> 14:38.411
You're just, you're so naive.

14:38.478 --> 14:42.582
He-he, he is my colleague
and friend.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.251
Like Sarah is your friend

14:44.317 --> 14:46.586
and it's not like
the two of you have ever..

14:49.556 --> 14:51.024
Have you?

14:53.393 --> 14:54.427
Oh, you have.

14:55.595 --> 14:56.930
- 'You've slept with her.'
- No.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.166
- This is ridiculous!

14:59.232 --> 15:01.068
Can we both just put down
our boxin' gloves?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.803
Don't lie to me, Matthew.
I saw it in your face.

15:03.870 --> 15:07.174
I saw it.
You can't take it back.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.278
- No.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.613
A 100 percent no, I promise.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.317
Tell me..

15:18.986 --> 15:20.954
Tell me it wasn't then.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.292
Oh.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.130
Robs, please, I haven't even..

16:04.564 --> 16:07.000
'Rob, I've messed up.'

16:08.768 --> 16:10.237
'I've messed up.'

16:10.303 --> 16:12.139
'Message deleted.'

16:12.205 --> 16:14.674
'Next, new message.'

16:14.741 --> 16:16.609
'I'm trying to get
a hold of you.'

16:16.676 --> 16:18.445
'Call me back, will you?'

16:18.511 --> 16:20.280
'Message deleted.'

16:20.347 --> 16:22.615
'Next, new message.'

16:22.682 --> 16:24.117
'Why aren't you pickin'..'

16:24.184 --> 16:25.285
'Message deleted.'

16:25.352 --> 16:27.487
'Next, new message.'

16:27.554 --> 16:29.656
- 'Robin, please..'
- 'Message deleted.'

16:29.722 --> 16:31.324
'Next, new message.'

16:31.391 --> 16:32.625
'Ellacott, call me AS..'

16:32.692 --> 16:34.427
'Message deleted.'

17:43.930 --> 17:45.632
Hi, I'm here.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.367
Yeah, I was still following
that stripper--

17:47.434 --> 17:49.269
We were sent
a severed leg yesterday.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.837
He even spelled your name
with two T's.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.107
So, keep your phone on and pick
the damn thing up when I call.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.177
- Yeah, I'll try.
- 'Meet me in the office.'

17:57.244 --> 17:58.645
'At 5:00.'

18:00.547 --> 18:03.250
[Blue Oyster Cult singing
"Mistress Of The Salmon Salt"]

18:12.225 --> 18:15.362
* In the garden district *

18:17.197 --> 18:19.566
Another one.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.603
* Behind the bush
there lurks a girl *

18:23.670 --> 18:27.974
* Who makes them
strong and tall *

18:28.040 --> 18:30.510
* The villagers call her *

18:30.577 --> 18:34.214
* Quicklime girl
behind her back *

18:34.281 --> 18:38.117
* Quicklime girl
behind the bush *

18:38.185 --> 18:40.453
* Quicklime girl *

18:40.520 --> 18:45.158
* She's the mistress
of the salmon salt *

18:45.225 --> 18:47.059
* Quicklime girl *

18:47.126 --> 18:48.928
* Quicklime girl *

18:48.995 --> 18:50.863
* Quicklime girl **

19:01.341 --> 19:03.676
It's ten past six.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.011
You alright?

19:05.077 --> 19:07.814
Um...hold on.

19:07.880 --> 19:10.617
I'm just, I'm not sure
I'm up to this today.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.125
'What are you doing?'

19:19.192 --> 19:20.727
Nothing.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.429
Are you alone?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.031
- I'm waitin' for someone.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.033
No, you can't.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.005
Alright, what's going on
with you?

19:33.072 --> 19:35.074
How'd you know I was here?

19:35.141 --> 19:37.644
I'm a detective.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.412
I could hear the Pogues playing
when I called you.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.548
- They're always playin' here.
- Hm.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.852
What do you need?

19:45.918 --> 19:48.555
I don't need anything.
What's goin' on?

19:48.621 --> 19:51.190
- Nothing.
- 'Well, don't give me that.'

19:51.258 --> 19:53.125
I've never seen you look so bad.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.297
Morale duly boosted.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.437
Where's your engagement ring?

20:06.473 --> 20:08.708
Put two and two together,
you're the detective.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.584
Matthew cheated on me.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.421
Oh.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.290
Hmm.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.924
What a moron!

20:26.359 --> 20:28.728
It was a long time ago, but..

20:28.795 --> 20:31.631
...it was with one of the most
annoying women I know.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.269
'
- Yep.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.972
'We had dinner with her
the other night.'

20:56.556 --> 20:58.958
They started
just after I left uni.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.793
I'm surprised
he'd admit to it now.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.862
He didn't. I just..

21:03.830 --> 21:06.265
I just knew.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.801
He looked ashamed of himself
because of..

21:11.338 --> 21:13.740
...because of...when.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.484
I dropped out of uni..

21:26.886 --> 21:28.287
...because something
happened to me

21:28.355 --> 21:30.590
and afterwards, I had problems.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.931
I was coming back
from a friend's house.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.370
It wasn't even late.

21:43.436 --> 21:46.839
Apparently, he'd...tried
to attack someone else

21:46.906 --> 21:49.409
and there'd been a warning
about him in the news, but..

21:55.314 --> 21:58.418
I played dead, and he ran.

22:01.187 --> 22:02.989
That's how I survived.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.827
He was wearing
a rubber gorilla mask

22:07.894 --> 22:11.731
but he had this white patch
of skin behind his ear.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.968
My evidence got him put away.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.670
Rape and attempted murder.

22:19.406 --> 22:22.274
It was 20 bad minutes
of a whole life

22:22.341 --> 22:23.676
and I am still the same person.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.512
I know that, it's just a..

22:26.646 --> 22:28.915
...horrible thing
to have happened to you.

22:31.584 --> 22:34.120
Afterwards, I..

22:34.186 --> 22:36.789
...I couldn't leave my room,
I had to go home to mum and dad.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.359
That's when..

22:45.131 --> 22:46.799
...Matthew and Sarah..

22:48.668 --> 22:51.303
Well, I'll, um,
see you in the morning.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.573
- Ugh!

22:54.974 --> 22:58.411
Everyone I know in London
is Matthew's friend, and..

22:58.478 --> 23:00.713
I'll get a youth hostel
or a YMCA.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.114
Do they still have those?

23:02.181 --> 23:04.016
I'll take you somewhere proper.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.685
I'm totally skinned.

23:05.752 --> 23:09.155
Well, that's probably my fault.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.490
I'll pay.

23:10.557 --> 23:13.826
We'll call it a wedding
cancellation present.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.672
Where is it, though?

23:40.687 --> 23:41.788
Wow.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.092
This is really nice.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.962
I do your books, remember?
I know you can't afford this.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.297
Checkout's at 11:00.

23:51.363 --> 23:54.166
And keep this door locked,
and stay away from the mini bar.

24:26.432 --> 24:27.600
Hey! Watch it!

25:39.505 --> 25:41.974
...the leg.
Any idea who it's from?

25:42.041 --> 25:43.710
- Fuck off.
- Like to know who it's from.

26:23.049 --> 26:24.984
'Mate, it's nearly midnight.'

26:25.051 --> 26:27.086
- I have no idea.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.155
'The press are outside my door.'

26:29.221 --> 26:31.858
It's not good for my business
being sent limbs in the post.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.125
I'm sure you appreciate that.

26:33.192 --> 26:36.095
You know how it is.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.798
Whoever sent me that leg
also knows how it is.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.833
So, let's not play
their game, shall we?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.969
'Listen, how am I supp..'

27:20.707 --> 27:22.842
- Body of a young girl.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.210
Hands and legs sawn off.

27:24.276 --> 27:27.379
Caucasian, maybe aged around 16.
Cleaner found her.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.181
Anything found on the scene
apart from the body?

27:29.248 --> 27:31.684
There's a phone, but no bag
or wallet or anything.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.886
Nothing to ID her.
Phone's gone to Forensics.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.254
How about CCTV?

27:35.321 --> 27:37.589
The camera in the lobby,
we're doin' the tapes.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.358
- Might get lucky.
- Right.

27:51.603 --> 27:55.007
- Hello.
- 'Oh...hi.'

27:55.074 --> 27:57.810
There's a squirm of parasites
on my doorstep.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.078
'I'll need to find this guy'

27:59.145 --> 28:01.280
'before we're put out
of business.'

28:01.347 --> 28:03.783
I know it's a Saturday,
but this can't wait.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.890
- 'Yeah.'

28:10.957 --> 28:12.959
'I promise I'm fine to work.'

28:13.025 --> 28:14.927
Never doubted you.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.695
'Have them send you
a bacon sandwich.'

28:16.763 --> 28:18.697
Oof! Don't talk about food.

28:18.765 --> 28:21.300
'
- Uh, yeah.

28:21.367 --> 28:24.236
'I'm giving you
Nick and Ilsa's address.'

28:24.303 --> 28:25.404
'80 Octavia Street.'

28:25.471 --> 28:27.974
Oh, by the way,
careful exiting the hotel.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.209
'We were followed last night.'

28:31.643 --> 28:33.079
Alright. What's the address?

28:39.485 --> 28:41.788
Sorry.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.422
I'm down to two clients
overnight.

28:43.489 --> 28:46.058
And the rest have run
screaming to the hills.

28:46.125 --> 28:48.527
Well, a severed leg
on the front pages

28:48.594 --> 28:50.229
will do that.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.664
'Business will pick up again.'

28:52.731 --> 28:54.066
If this guy wanted to kill me

28:54.133 --> 28:56.035
it's not difficult.
I'm a big enough target.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.270
That reminds me, we should
talk about your cholesterol.

28:58.337 --> 29:00.439
The leg,
the Blue Oyster Cult lyrics.

29:00.506 --> 29:01.974
That's someone going
to a lot of effort

29:02.041 --> 29:04.010
to get inside my head..

29:04.076 --> 29:06.979
...and butchering someone
to use as a prop.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.816
It's Robin, isn't it?
That's who you're worried about.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.184
Robin has,
and I quote her verbatim

29:12.251 --> 29:15.254
a certificate for a three-day
self-defense course.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.989
I like Robin.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.692
Well, so do I.

29:20.759 --> 29:23.395
I just don't need to add her
to the dead and maimed women

29:23.462 --> 29:25.264
I carry around in my head.

29:38.344 --> 29:42.181
And this is the same night,
but 18 minutes earlier.

29:45.584 --> 29:47.019
'Yeah.'

29:52.558 --> 29:54.526
You have to bring him in.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.125
That's right.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.094
'Talk to you later.'

30:30.129 --> 30:33.399
- Oh, yes, please. I feel awful.

30:33.465 --> 30:36.435
That's because you drank
every bottle of wine in London.

30:38.470 --> 30:40.706
Radford called me
on the way here.

30:40.772 --> 30:44.343
- Cancelled his job with us.
- Just one client now.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.846
He says he's really sorry, but..

30:47.914 --> 30:51.450
...just...exposure, and--

30:51.517 --> 30:54.420
No. I get it.

30:55.654 --> 30:57.656
I've got an old address
for Brockbank's sister

30:57.723 --> 30:59.758
Holly, somewhere.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.660
- Barrow-in-Furness.
- Mm-hm.

31:01.727 --> 31:03.529
It's the only solid lead
we've got and business isn't

31:03.595 --> 31:05.764
exactly thriving,
so I thought we'd start there.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.866
Great. Well, I'll come with you.

31:09.902 --> 31:12.171
You'd be more use in the office.

31:12.238 --> 31:14.406
I can do the research work
from anywhere.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.542
'And I've got the Land Rover
and you can't drive'

31:16.608 --> 31:19.278
which will save us
time and money.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.147
And I need this case solved
before we go bust

31:21.213 --> 31:22.448
and I lose my job.

31:22.514 --> 31:23.882
And if you're worried
about my safety

31:23.950 --> 31:25.384
I'll be better off
out of London.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.556
Matthew can shove his thoughts
up his own arse.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.245
- Robin, please.
- Don't touch me.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.917
- Ah. Oh, he had to nip off.

32:31.984 --> 32:34.053
- See the police.
- Oh.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.122
Do you fancy some lunch?

32:36.188 --> 32:38.190
Glass of water would be great.

32:39.825 --> 32:42.061
Have you been
in Whitechapel recently?

32:42.128 --> 32:43.929
- Yes.
'

32:43.996 --> 32:46.265
- 'A client.'

32:46.332 --> 32:47.899
We never ended up meeting.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.602
His name was...Valley, I think.

32:50.669 --> 32:53.105
- We didn't meet.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.940
Where did you try to meet?

32:55.007 --> 32:58.110
It was a short let
office building.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.578
I could find you the address.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.780
We just found the young woman's
body in a building

33:01.847 --> 33:03.682
in Whitechapel High Street.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.251
Both legs removed.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.486
There was a phone at the scene
with her prints on it.

33:07.553 --> 33:10.089
Forensics got it
unlocked for us.

33:11.090 --> 33:13.025
Right.

33:13.092 --> 33:14.426
What did you find?

33:14.493 --> 33:17.163
We found it was you
that invited her there.

33:20.232 --> 33:21.933
Hi, this is Cormoran Strike.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.603
I am here. You're..

33:26.805 --> 33:28.107
...not.

33:33.345 --> 33:35.447
Invented this at med school.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.517
Vitamins, anti-inflammatories,
and a raw egg

33:38.584 --> 33:41.087
prove you're the hardest bastard
in the room.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.393
Let's get goin'.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.262
- Interviewed me under caution.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.564
Just shy of having me
arrested for murder.

33:55.967 --> 33:58.003
Needed that.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.338
Go on.

33:59.405 --> 34:01.473
Well, at least Wardle
believes you.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.909
That I'm not grooming
teenage girls to carve up.

34:03.975 --> 34:06.145
Yeah, that's a real vote
of confidence.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.950
Can you send Wardle
what we've got on the client

34:12.017 --> 34:13.885
I was supposed
to meet in Whitechapel?

34:13.952 --> 34:15.387
Sure.

34:18.357 --> 34:21.893
So, how does it help frame you,
him sending you her leg?

34:21.960 --> 34:23.629
Depends on what the killer's
trying to achieve.

34:23.695 --> 34:25.331
If they wanna make sure
I never work again

34:25.397 --> 34:27.199
send me the leg,
involve me in a murder case

34:27.266 --> 34:29.135
and let the press do the rest.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.965
Do you still think
it's one of those three men?

35:00.031 --> 35:01.733
Yeah, I do. More than ever.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.403
Whittaker got away
with murder twice.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.038
Laing charmed everyone while
he kept his wife terrified.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.975
Brockbank was a child rapist
who managed to convince everyone

35:10.041 --> 35:12.678
that he was the injured party.

35:12.744 --> 35:15.080
'And you think he could cut off
his own daughter's leg?'

35:15.147 --> 35:18.350
'I don't know what to think, but
I know he wants revenge on me.'

35:21.453 --> 35:24.690
Major Brockbank?
This is Sergeant Strike, SIB.

35:27.025 --> 35:28.794
'Brittany, back inside.'

35:42.308 --> 35:44.710
'So, he might be living
with his sister?'

35:44.776 --> 35:46.445
'Well, Brockbank's army pension'

35:46.512 --> 35:48.914
goes to her address
in Barrow every month.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.149
She's our only lead.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.759
How you doin'?

36:00.826 --> 36:03.662
Pfft. Bit shit.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.898
'Matthew keeps texting.'

36:06.965 --> 36:09.067
Would you like to hear
about the migratory patterns

36:09.134 --> 36:11.002
of the black marlin?

36:11.069 --> 36:13.171
'We have two hours to go.'

36:43.168 --> 36:46.204
- 431 YUT.
- 'Wait a second.'

36:52.711 --> 36:55.614
'Someone known
as a Mr. Michael Ellacott.'

36:56.548 --> 36:58.617
Are you Michael Ellacott?

36:58.684 --> 37:00.786
Um, uh, no, that's my dad.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.621
'You parked in into the yellow.'

37:02.688 --> 37:05.624
There's no loitering
near a nuclear facility.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.259
Can I see your license, please?

37:07.326 --> 37:09.127
Uh, yeah.

37:09.194 --> 37:11.663
Is that what, um,
uh, what that is?

37:12.364 --> 37:14.232
Shipyard, yeah.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.702
- Oh, not, not together.

37:16.768 --> 37:19.438
- Denmark Street, London.
- Ealing, London.

37:19.505 --> 37:21.106
'You up here on holiday?'

37:21.172 --> 37:24.476
Does anyone ever come
to Barrow

37:25.777 --> 37:29.147
The abbey's popular,
and the nature reserves.

37:29.214 --> 37:31.550
We were, uh, hoping to catch up

37:31.617 --> 37:32.818
with a friend
on our way to Scotland.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.354
Where can I go
to have decent coffee?

37:35.421 --> 37:38.790
No photography in this area.
Alright?

37:38.857 --> 37:39.958
Roger that.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.229
Yeah, it was an out.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.397
- Morning.
- Morning.

37:45.464 --> 37:47.666
Roger that?

37:47.733 --> 37:49.200
Well, you weren't
exactly helpful.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.969
Who'd holiday in Barrow?

37:51.036 --> 37:53.905
- She's obviously from here.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.874
- To ask after Brockbank.
- 'No, no, no.'

37:55.941 --> 37:57.843
Don't knock on Holly's door.
He might still live there.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.678
'No, I'm gonna go
and ask that woman.'

37:59.745 --> 38:02.047
She looks like
she'd be the type to gossip.

38:05.016 --> 38:07.719
Hey, excuse me, sorry, I, uh..

38:07.786 --> 38:09.588
...wondered if you might
be able to help me.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.859
It has to be me.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.661
If Holly recognizes you,
she shall tell Noel

38:15.727 --> 38:17.128
that you're lookin' for him.

38:17.195 --> 38:20.766
- Anyway, this will work.
- I don't like it.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.902
You don't have to like it.
It's still a good idea.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.835
Great.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.371
Well, the good news is
my hangover's finally lifting.

39:00.972 --> 39:04.376
Oh. Oh.

39:04.443 --> 39:07.078
I, I better get this.
It's my mum. Sorry.

39:09.481 --> 39:11.282
- Hi, mum.
- 'Matthew called me.'

39:11.349 --> 39:13.018
'He told me the two of you
have broken up.'

39:13.084 --> 39:15.521
- 'He said you left him.'

39:15.587 --> 39:17.723
Look, I-I-I can't
really talk right now.

39:17.789 --> 39:20.726
- I'm away with Strike.
- 'Oh! I see.'

39:20.792 --> 39:23.962
No, not like that.
It's work. We're, um..

39:24.029 --> 39:25.764
Someone sent him a l..

39:25.831 --> 39:28.299
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's, it's work.

39:28.366 --> 39:30.902
'
- Yeah, I'm..

39:32.337 --> 39:35.206
Oh, I don't know, I..

39:35.273 --> 39:37.909
I can't really talk about Matt
right now. It's, um..

39:37.976 --> 39:39.545
It's all so new, so I..

39:39.611 --> 39:42.380
'I'm gonna come and see you as
soon as you get back to London.'

39:42.448 --> 39:44.349
'Yeah, that'd be nice. Thanks.'

39:44.416 --> 39:46.718
- 'Bye, then.'
- Love you. Bye.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.294
So, according to that old lady

39:56.361 --> 39:58.864
Holly's in here every lunchtime.

39:58.930 --> 40:01.633
Let's hope she's a nicer
Brockbank than her brother.

40:06.204 --> 40:08.540
- Yeah.

40:24.355 --> 40:25.757
Thanks, Robert.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.863
Hi, I'm looking
for Holly Brockbank.

40:35.734 --> 40:39.004
'

40:39.070 --> 40:40.472
Sorry?

40:40.539 --> 40:42.440
Who are you?

40:42.508 --> 40:45.343
My name's Venetia Hall.
I'm a lawyer.

40:45.410 --> 40:46.678
I'm trying to find Noel.

40:46.745 --> 40:48.747
Don't know. Don't care.

40:48.814 --> 40:52.450
Only, I believe he's owed money.
Him and his family.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.154
- Well, his close family.

40:56.221 --> 41:00.492
Parents, siblings,
anyone who he's lived with.

41:00.559 --> 41:03.394
Why is that then?

41:03.461 --> 41:05.697
Well, my company specializes

41:05.764 --> 41:07.766
in gaining reparations
for servicemen

41:07.833 --> 41:10.802
who have been injured outside
of combat operations.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.605
Alright.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.440
I'd like to help you
make a lot of money

41:15.507 --> 41:17.208
off the government, Holly.

41:17.275 --> 41:19.878
All you have to do is tell me
your side of things.

41:26.618 --> 41:27.753
- 'Wardle.'
- Hey.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.154
Have you found Whittaker yet?

41:29.220 --> 41:30.622
No, not yet.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.558
'I think you should look
into Donald Laing'

41:32.624 --> 41:33.759
'spelled A-I.'

41:33.825 --> 41:35.694
'I've had him sent down
for 16 years'

41:35.761 --> 41:37.428
'but he's probably out by now.'

41:37.495 --> 41:39.364
'He did his time in Glasgow.'

41:39.430 --> 41:41.767
'I'll text you the details.'

41:41.833 --> 41:43.468
Yeah, send me anything
you've got.

41:43.535 --> 41:45.136
'I will.'

41:48.273 --> 41:51.009
- Last one.

41:51.076 --> 41:52.978
Well, we know
that Noel suffered

41:53.044 --> 41:56.047
some problems during his time
in the army.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.082
Problems?

41:57.148 --> 41:58.717
Some fuckin' police copper
smashed his head

41:58.784 --> 42:00.418
and damaged him for life.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.688
Uh, do you mind if I, um..

42:02.754 --> 42:04.489
You don't happen
to remember the copper's name?

42:04.556 --> 42:06.792
Of course I do.
Cormoran Strike.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.527
Fucking gadgie. Destroyed him.

42:09.595 --> 42:11.129
Noel started having fits.

42:11.196 --> 42:12.664
Couldn't get any work
any more after that.

42:12.731 --> 42:14.600
- Not properly.
- Right.

42:14.666 --> 42:17.502
He'd come around two hours,
smash the place up.

42:17.569 --> 42:18.904
Smash me up.

42:18.970 --> 42:20.939
Have you seen this nose?
Fuckin' seen that?

42:21.006 --> 42:22.708
That's a nose
that's been hit hard.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.242
That one's paying for
by the army.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.912
Oh, absolutely. Look,
I'm sorry you've suffered.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.414
- I have.
- Really.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.150
We're gonna try
and secure you a solid payout.

42:35.153 --> 42:38.857
Well, well, the truth is,
Ms. Hall

42:38.924 --> 42:42.227
I've had a properly shit life.

42:42.293 --> 42:45.797
You know, we both did
when we were kids.

42:45.864 --> 42:49.635
But at least he got all the way
to be a major in the army.

42:49.701 --> 42:52.638
That's good money
and good respect.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.005
And all of that went

42:54.072 --> 42:56.107
after Cormoran Strike
bashed his head in.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.979
How

43:01.046 --> 43:03.849
Works shit jobs
in rubbish strip joints.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.884
They have him for a bouncer.

43:05.951 --> 43:09.454
Not what it was though.
Don't last long.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.623
He's in London now.

43:11.690 --> 43:13.825
More work there for him.

43:17.095 --> 43:19.698
Author of "The After Run
Society," nine letters.

43:19.765 --> 43:22.267
- Uh..

43:22.333 --> 43:23.935
Half a glass of wine, I'm fine.

43:24.002 --> 43:27.038
He's not here,
but I got a number for him.

43:28.674 --> 43:30.275
Well bloody done.

43:30.341 --> 43:33.311
- Apparently, he's in London.

43:33.378 --> 43:36.682
I think we should give it a day
or two in case Holly calls.

43:36.748 --> 43:39.450
Let the story bed in.

43:39.517 --> 43:40.819
You know,
if we lose the business

43:40.886 --> 43:42.821
I might try
personal injury claims.

43:42.888 --> 43:44.756
Think I've got a knack for it.

43:44.823 --> 43:47.826
What could you get me
for my missing leg?

43:47.893 --> 43:50.095
Packet of crisps and a pint.

43:54.766 --> 43:56.267
Anywhere cheap
to stay around here?

43:56.334 --> 43:58.203
There's a Comfort City Express
down the road.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.871
Thanks.

43:59.938 --> 44:03.241
Holly told me
you smashed Noel's head in.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.910
'Is that true?'

44:07.412 --> 44:11.049
Oh, I can play you the interview
on scene with Brittany.

44:11.116 --> 44:13.318
Framed my response to him.

44:37.175 --> 44:38.844
He had a pre-existing concussion

44:38.910 --> 44:41.012
from playing rugby that week.

44:41.079 --> 44:43.314
'He started to have
epileptic fits.'

44:43.381 --> 44:45.350
I got him to let it out.

44:45.416 --> 44:47.585
In between the fits,
he'd tell anyone who'd listen

44:47.652 --> 44:50.321
that he was going to destroy me.

44:50.388 --> 44:52.657
Perks of the job.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.726
What happened to Brittany?

44:57.228 --> 44:58.830
I spoke to the wife.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.631
She wouldn't hear a word of it.

45:00.698 --> 45:04.369
Brittany was telling tales,
a naughty little liar.

45:04.435 --> 45:07.472
Noel was a good man
and a good father.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.108
And off they went.

45:10.175 --> 45:12.310
She was 12.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.645
After that, he knew
she'd tell on him

45:14.712 --> 45:16.982
and she knew
that help wasn't coming.

45:18.884 --> 45:21.452
She's the one
I find hard to live with.

45:21.519 --> 45:23.889
We have to find him
and put him away.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.958
- If he's our killer.
- He's a child rapist!

45:27.025 --> 45:29.094
'The army
did their job properly.'

45:29.160 --> 45:31.396
'There wasn't enough
evidence for a case.'

45:32.864 --> 45:36.634
- I know this must be hard--
- Don't. Do not.

45:36.701 --> 45:38.937
You promised.

45:39.004 --> 45:40.839
It's hard for anyone to hear.

45:42.707 --> 45:44.742
What are we supposed to do,
hunt them all down?

45:44.810 --> 45:46.277
Yeah.

45:46.344 --> 45:49.214
All of that and pay off
the utilities bill.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.017
We'll tell British Gas
that's what we've decided.

46:03.394 --> 46:04.863
Thanks.

46:18.810 --> 46:20.445
Good evening.
Are you looking for--

46:20.511 --> 46:24.149
- Two singles, please.
- Two singles, alright, okay.

46:24.215 --> 46:26.885
Is that one room
with two single beds or--

46:26.952 --> 46:28.619
Um, if you've got
two different rooms..

46:28.686 --> 46:30.555
Two rooms.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.324
- Single in each.
- One bed in each of 'em.

46:33.391 --> 46:35.193
Oh, right.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.895
I'm, I'm not trying to pry,
I have to check--

46:36.962 --> 46:39.697
No, that's fine.
Thank you.

46:39.764 --> 46:40.932
- Hm.
- Here we are.

46:40.999 --> 46:42.200
Is your leg alright?

46:42.267 --> 46:45.370
No, it's been blown off.

46:45.436 --> 46:46.671
You're limping.

46:46.737 --> 46:49.074
You offering me a piggyback?

46:49.140 --> 46:52.077
Could be the last thing
you ever do.

46:52.143 --> 46:55.713
I'm stronger than I look.
It's all those gymkhanas I did.

46:55.780 --> 46:57.582
Did you carry the horse?

46:59.250 --> 47:01.386
If you hear anything,
I'm just in here.

47:02.687 --> 47:04.055
Okay.

47:30.848 --> 47:32.283
- 'It's me.'

47:32.350 --> 47:34.352
- 'I've just heard from Wardle.'
- Oh.

47:35.686 --> 47:36.854
We're not going home just yet.

47:36.922 --> 47:38.256
Wardle's found an old address
for Laing.

47:38.323 --> 47:39.724
He was living with someone
in Corby.

47:39.790 --> 47:40.758
Great.

47:40.825 --> 47:42.660
We should check it out tomorrow.

47:42.727 --> 47:43.995
- Oh, well, night.
- Night.

47:44.062 --> 47:45.363
I-I was just telling you now
in case

47:45.430 --> 47:46.898
you're making other plans
for tomorrow.

47:46.965 --> 47:48.733
Yeah.

47:48.799 --> 47:50.801
- Sleep well.
- Sleep well.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.537
'Yeah, you too.'

47:58.709 --> 47:59.877
Oh.

48:27.138 --> 48:29.007
Give us one then.

48:35.480 --> 48:36.614
Thanks.

48:49.460 --> 48:50.595
Thanks.

48:52.197 --> 48:55.200
So, how did you meet Laing?

48:55.266 --> 48:58.336
I was on a drugs case
in Cyprus, undercover

48:58.403 --> 49:01.172
buying grass off a local guy who
dealt with a lot of soldiers.

49:01.239 --> 49:04.275
He told me about a squatter
who said he chained his wife up

49:04.342 --> 49:06.411
when she threatened
to leave him.

49:06.477 --> 49:08.579
'Sounded like grandstanding,
but..'

49:10.381 --> 49:12.817
...I checked it out anyway.

49:12.883 --> 49:15.686
When no one answered the door,
I kicked it in.

49:15.753 --> 49:17.355
The smell hit me first.

49:17.422 --> 49:21.092
I went upstairs and found
his wife in the bedroom.

49:21.159 --> 49:24.529
He told the court she was
kinky, liked to be tied up.

49:24.595 --> 49:27.665
She'd broken her wrist
and dislocated her shoulder

49:27.732 --> 49:29.967
tryin' to get free.

49:30.035 --> 49:32.137
And there were
internal injuries.

49:41.746 --> 49:43.281
Tell me he didn't get off.

49:43.348 --> 49:45.183
'Went down for 16 years.'

49:45.250 --> 49:46.984
'He probably did eight.'

49:48.953 --> 49:51.156
He'd have been out a while now.

50:04.269 --> 50:06.371
Are you Lorraine MacNaughton?

50:06.437 --> 50:08.139
- I'm a detective.

50:08.206 --> 50:10.075
I'm looking for information
on Donald Laing.

50:10.141 --> 50:12.710
I heard he lived here
a few years ago.

50:15.780 --> 50:17.715
No. Thank Christ.

50:17.782 --> 50:20.751
Would you mind if my partner
and I asked you a few questions?

50:24.622 --> 50:26.691
'Was it robbery he's done?'

50:26.757 --> 50:28.459
Why'd you say that?

50:28.526 --> 50:31.496
'Because he robbed me
when he left.'

50:31.562 --> 50:33.564
He took my jewelry.

50:33.631 --> 50:35.200
He took my mum's ring.

50:35.266 --> 50:37.001
I'm sorry, that's terrible.

50:37.068 --> 50:39.304
How did you meet Donald?

50:39.370 --> 50:41.206
Pub.

50:41.272 --> 50:44.075
He was very charming.

50:44.142 --> 50:46.777
Sorry, I know
that sounds stupid.

50:46.844 --> 50:49.814
He had his own company
in Scotland, and..

50:49.880 --> 50:51.682
But he got ill.

50:51.749 --> 50:55.620
- Oh, it was nasty.

50:55.686 --> 50:58.123
Psoriatic arthritis.

50:58.189 --> 51:00.258
Some days,
he couldn't even move.

51:00.325 --> 51:02.560
- Here, let me take that.
- Oh, thank you.

51:02.627 --> 51:05.496
- Not even a year.

51:05.563 --> 51:07.965
It was after my mum died.

51:08.032 --> 51:11.736
Donny did some work
for Mrs. Williams at number 37

51:11.802 --> 51:14.305
'across the road.'

51:14.372 --> 51:15.840
'Eighty-seven
with a lawn to cut'

51:15.906 --> 51:19.577
and all her kids
have gone abroad, you know?

51:22.079 --> 51:24.048
He was nice to me.

51:24.115 --> 51:27.285
'And he did raise money
for charity.'

51:27.352 --> 51:30.020
Despite it all, um..

51:30.087 --> 51:32.557
- I miss him.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.426
No. And-and I told
the police that.

51:35.493 --> 51:38.296
Was this when you reported
your jewelry missing?

51:38.363 --> 51:40.831
No, Mrs. Williams was robbed

51:40.898 --> 51:42.633
and attacked.

51:42.700 --> 51:45.703
- She's passed since then.

51:48.373 --> 51:49.840
'Poor old Mrs. Williams.'

51:49.907 --> 51:52.910
Beaten shitless
for a couple of quid.

51:52.977 --> 51:54.745
So, do you reckon
that was Laing?

51:54.812 --> 51:57.748
Cased it while he was mowing
her lawn, didn't he?

51:57.815 --> 52:00.285
For men like Laing
and Brockbank and Whittaker

52:00.351 --> 52:02.253
women are things to be used.

52:03.721 --> 52:06.457
And she still misses him.

52:18.936 --> 52:20.137
'Here we go.'

52:20.205 --> 52:22.039
Donald Laing's
great charity efforts.

52:22.106 --> 52:23.441
Go on.

52:23.508 --> 52:25.276
- Forty pounds.
- Oh.

52:25.343 --> 52:27.678
Raised for psoriatic arthritis.

52:27.745 --> 52:29.013
Well, it's not nothing.

52:29.079 --> 52:30.815
Well, you can certainly say
for absolutely sure

52:30.881 --> 52:33.418
that people have started
to realize he's a leech.

52:33.484 --> 52:34.752
Yeah.

52:39.990 --> 52:42.260
Where are you gonna stay?

52:42.327 --> 52:43.861
Uh, at the flat.

52:45.296 --> 52:47.031
At least for tonight.

52:47.097 --> 52:48.633
Matthew's away, so..

52:50.268 --> 52:51.569
Right.

53:13.458 --> 53:14.825
'Thank you. Have a good night.'

53:14.892 --> 53:16.394
You too.

53:42.620 --> 53:46.223
'
- Office.

53:47.792 --> 53:49.360
I found Whittaker.

53:51.462 --> 53:54.599
I know a girl who said,
"Daddy, daddy, I love that pig."

53:54.665 --> 53:58.202
And the farmer said, "Well,
we all used to love the pig."

53:58.269 --> 54:00.471
'Then the pigs become diseased.'

54:00.538 --> 54:02.607
They won't stop squealin'.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.278
Wait.

54:09.013 --> 54:10.448
Bob Bunsen.

54:18.856 --> 54:21.258
Very nice. See ya later.

54:44.114 --> 54:47.885
Would you get in?
Hey, Joe, get me some fags.

54:50.154 --> 54:53.991
'Well, look who it is.
Sherlock fuckin' Holmes.'

54:54.058 --> 54:55.360
As I live and breathe.

54:55.426 --> 54:58.663
Steph, come here.

54:58.729 --> 55:01.231
Let me tell you a little story
about this guy.

55:01.298 --> 55:05.069
'I was banging his mummy
back in the day for a while.'

55:05.135 --> 55:06.804
I gave her a kid.

55:06.871 --> 55:09.940
'Now she, she was
a juicy old tart.'

55:10.007 --> 55:11.308
This man kills women.

55:11.376 --> 55:13.110
'You think this one
gives a shit?'

55:13.177 --> 55:16.781
She barely knows where she is
half the time. Bless her.

55:16.847 --> 55:19.384
I love him, darling.

55:19.450 --> 55:21.051
Do you know what mummy
used to like to do?

55:21.118 --> 55:23.454
She used to like to suck me off

55:23.521 --> 55:25.556
'after I sang to her.'

55:25.623 --> 55:26.757
- Mm-hmm.

55:26.824 --> 55:30.127
Sing her a song,
and then down she'd go.

55:30.194 --> 55:31.696
Pavlovian response.

55:33.898 --> 55:35.433
Fuck.

55:35.500 --> 55:36.767
I can find you
somewhere to stay.

55:36.834 --> 55:39.003
Just fucking get in the van.

55:41.038 --> 55:42.540
Motherfucker.

55:52.717 --> 55:53.984
'Hello?'

55:54.051 --> 55:55.185
Hello.

55:55.252 --> 55:56.821
'Zaharah, give that here.'

55:56.887 --> 56:00.357
'Ring ring, ring ring.'

56:00.425 --> 56:03.561
'

56:03.628 --> 56:05.696
- 'Aye.'
- This is, um, Venetia Hall.

56:05.763 --> 56:07.297
I'm a personal injury
claims lawyer.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.767
I spoke to your sister, Holly,
about getting compensation

56:09.834 --> 56:12.970
from the army for the injuries
they caused you.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.505
'How's that?'

56:14.572 --> 56:17.074
Well, I-I'd be very happy
to go over it with you

56:17.141 --> 56:20.678
if you're able to meet.
Where might be convenient?

56:20.745 --> 56:23.414
'What about Shoreditch?'

56:23.481 --> 56:25.750
Could I maybe have
a home address for you

56:25.816 --> 56:28.819
and then I can send you
our paperwork?

56:28.886 --> 56:31.456
'Do I know you, little girl?'

56:32.923 --> 56:35.593
I'm pretty sure we've never met.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.432
Hm.

56:59.116 --> 57:01.852
I love him, darling.

57:01.919 --> 57:04.522
One day, you'll feel like that
about somebody.

57:41.191 --> 57:43.160
- 'It's Wardle.'

57:43.227 --> 57:46.931
- 'Open the door.'
- Hold on. Gotta get my leg on.

58:03.781 --> 58:05.816
You ever met this girl?

58:08.052 --> 58:10.487
- No.
- Have a good look.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.660
I haven't met her. Who is she?

58:18.896 --> 58:21.198
She's the girl
we found in Whitechapel.

58:21.265 --> 58:22.733
So you've identified the body?

58:22.800 --> 58:25.235
Well, I'm not sure
we can claim all the credit.

58:25.302 --> 58:27.705
Took the morning papers
for us to piece it together.

58:38.382 --> 58:40.685
You've never met her?

58:40.751 --> 58:42.252
Kelsey Platt.

59:22.459 --> 59:24.962
The three names I gave you,
who've you found?

59:25.029 --> 59:26.764
We're still making enquiries.

59:26.831 --> 59:28.298
He addressed the leg to you.

59:28.365 --> 59:30.534
He followed you. That's
the pattern we have so far.

59:30.601 --> 59:33.203
I know, and I will be careful.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.839
Oh, my God. It's you.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.941
I need to ask you
about your sister.

59:37.007 --> 59:39.376
Robin, I do think it's time
to make a decision.

59:39.443 --> 59:40.978
The wedding day is nearly here.

59:41.045 --> 59:43.748
She's been followed. She's had
body parts sent to her.

59:43.814 --> 59:45.816
Robin's good at what she does.
She's very good.

59:45.883 --> 59:48.085
She manages the risks.

59:48.152 --> 59:50.688
- Shanker!
- You're a sociopath.

59:50.755 --> 59:52.156
Have you seen something?

59:53.457 --> 59:54.825
We're finished.

59:56.460 --> 59:58.228
Let's just find this guy.

59:58.295 --> 59:59.296
Go, shit!
