00:01.288 --> 00:02.488
<i>Previously on "Switched at Birth"... </i>

00:02.522 --> 00:03.689
What did that guy say to you?

00:03.723 --> 00:05.341
<i>Whatever it is, I think
I have the right to know.</i>

00:05.375 --> 00:07.627
He said that he was
buying drugs from your dad.

00:07.661 --> 00:10.212
Was dad shot because he was selling drugs?

00:10.264 --> 00:11.430
I'm not gonna answer that.

00:11.465 --> 00:13.098
So this whole redeployment thing... 

00:13.116 --> 00:15.217
I've been looking up ways
that you could maybe get

00:15.252 --> 00:17.003
discharged honorably.

00:17.037 --> 00:18.137
Maybe we can talk to my dad.

00:18.155 --> 00:19.938
You know, politics can be a dirty business.

00:19.957 --> 00:22.041
They end up doing things
that can ruin lives.

00:22.075 --> 00:24.193
And when that happens, it's natural
for people to want to retaliate.

00:24.244 --> 00:26.746
I'm sick of lying to everyone.

00:26.780 --> 00:29.665
This is not who I am and you and I are... 

00:29.700 --> 00:30.766
done.

00:30.801 --> 00:32.551
- I'm her father.
- No, I'm her father!

00:32.601 --> 00:33.836
Leo and I. So you better lawyer up,

00:33.870 --> 00:35.454
because you're not
taking Abby away from us.

00:35.489 --> 00:36.522
What are you gonna do?

00:36.556 --> 00:37.690
I'm gonna fight until I get my kid back.

00:40.527 --> 00:42.478
- (Window locks)
- She's an infant, not a velociraptor.

00:42.529 --> 00:44.196
I think you're good.

00:44.214 --> 00:47.132
It happened so fast. I just
wanna make sure I'm ready.

00:47.150 --> 00:49.151
So, did Leo and Victor

00:49.202 --> 00:51.270
just decide to give her up?

00:51.305 --> 00:53.022
No, but I have a good lawyer

00:53.073 --> 00:54.907
and her D.N.A. matched.

00:54.925 --> 00:57.743
The judge agreed... Abby
belongs with her father.

00:58.694 --> 01:01.881
Consider all your outlets
officially baby-proofed... 

01:01.915 --> 01:03.816
seven months early.

01:03.850 --> 01:05.651
Thank you.

01:05.669 --> 01:06.836
Oh, I wish you wouldn't go.

01:06.870 --> 01:08.587
(Softly chuckles) Three of us in this place

01:08.622 --> 01:11.524
<i>- was already pushing it.
- I told you, I can sleep</i>

01:11.558 --> 01:13.526
in the living room; you can have my room.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.561
With Abby coming, I just think it's... 

01:15.595 --> 01:17.496
(Inhales) time that I go back.

01:17.531 --> 01:19.548
I know.

01:19.599 --> 01:22.335
Being here with you guys
this summer has been... 

01:22.369 --> 01:23.535
A long time coming.

01:25.322 --> 01:26.272
(Chuckles)

01:29.009 --> 01:30.876
I'll be back to babysit
whenever you need me.

01:30.911 --> 01:32.011
Okay.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.181
Bye.

01:39.086 --> 01:40.753
Call me as soon as you get... 

01:40.787 --> 01:41.721
home.

01:41.755 --> 01:42.988
(Sighs)

01:45.592 --> 01:46.842
(Quietly) Bye.

01:51.548 --> 01:52.664
<i>Chip: Excuse me. Daphne!</i>

01:52.812 --> 01:55.664
I just found out your last name is Vasquez.

01:55.698 --> 01:56.799
I had no idea.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.634
From the whole switched-at-birth thing.

01:58.668 --> 02:00.369
Oh, right, of course.

02:00.403 --> 02:03.305
Uh, so are your parents
Cuban by any chance?

02:03.340 --> 02:05.324
Uh... Puerto Rican.

02:05.358 --> 02:06.439
When people hear I'm from Cuba,

02:06.440 --> 02:08.050
do you know what they think of immediately?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.179
Cigars?

02:10.213 --> 02:12.031
Yes. And the second thing?

02:13.049 --> 02:14.083
Fidel Castro?

02:14.117 --> 02:15.985
The Cuban missile crisis.

02:16.019 --> 02:18.037
You've probably learned
about that in school, right?

02:18.013 --> 02:20.915
Just that it was the closest
we've ever come to nuclear war.

02:20.949 --> 02:23.918
Exactly. The only thing that kept us safe

02:23.952 --> 02:27.555
was that the Russians knew if they
ever launched a missile at us... 

02:27.589 --> 02:30.424
we'd launch one right back at them.

02:32.594 --> 02:35.312
You might wanna pass that
message along to anyone else

02:35.363 --> 02:37.214
you think should hear it.

02:37.249 --> 02:38.532
Okay?

02:38.567 --> 02:40.451
Have a good day, Daphne.

02:44.439 --> 02:48.909
Honey, um, Nikki's mom is coming
over later to discuss the wedding,

02:48.943 --> 02:51.211
and I was hoping that you could make sure

02:51.229 --> 02:53.147
the Porsche is in the garage.

02:53.181 --> 02:56.083
Uh, sure. Why?

02:56.117 --> 02:59.086
Well, she's a dental hygienist

02:59.104 --> 03:01.688
and a single mom, and I don't want her

03:01.706 --> 03:02.873
to feel uncomfortable... 

03:02.924 --> 03:05.476
or to judge us.

03:05.527 --> 03:07.861
- Look, I'm sure Denise... 
- Jennice.

03:07.879 --> 03:09.830
Okay then. I'm sure Jennice

03:09.848 --> 03:12.650
is just really grateful that we've agreed

03:12.701 --> 03:14.585
to host the wedding on two weeks notice.

03:14.636 --> 03:17.471
And we won't be judging her
and she won't be judging us.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.507
Unless, of course, you
haven't been flossing.

03:19.541 --> 03:21.141
(Laughs)

03:21.176 --> 03:22.543
<i>- Kathryn: Hey!
- Oh, look who's here!</i>

03:22.561 --> 03:25.145
How was your first night
back in your old bed?

03:26.164 --> 03:27.331
There you go. Your favorite... 

03:27.382 --> 03:28.415
Peanut butter pancakes.

03:28.450 --> 03:30.267
Aww, yes!

03:30.318 --> 03:33.037
Uh... hey, is coffee still on the menu?

03:33.071 --> 03:34.004
For you?

03:34.055 --> 03:36.957
I've been having it with, uh... 

03:36.992 --> 03:38.759
Oh.

03:38.793 --> 03:41.095
Sure. I don't see why not.

03:41.129 --> 03:43.080
- Milk and sugar?
- Bay: Yes, please.

03:43.114 --> 03:45.599
Thanks, dad. And there's actually

03:45.634 --> 03:47.701
something else I wanted
to talk to you about.

03:47.735 --> 03:50.404
Ty just got notice that he's
going to be deployed again

03:50.438 --> 03:52.606
to Afghanistan.

03:52.624 --> 03:55.509
Oh, my God, honey. I am so sorry.

03:55.543 --> 03:57.444
That's the thing. He already did one tour.

03:57.479 --> 04:00.347
And all these troops are being
sent home, and he has to go again.

04:00.382 --> 04:04.001
It's a shame, but that's the job.

04:04.035 --> 04:06.120
I know, which is why I was hoping

04:06.154 --> 04:07.254
there's something that you can do,

04:07.289 --> 04:09.890
<i>you know, as a Senator.</i>

04:09.925 --> 04:13.143
I'm not sure it's even
ethical for me to get involved.

04:13.194 --> 04:14.878
And what about all the soldiers

04:14.913 --> 04:17.865
<i>who aren't dating senators' daughters?</i>

04:17.899 --> 04:19.733
Somebody's gotta go.

04:19.767 --> 04:21.885
Right. And it's usually
the kids from East Riverside

04:21.920 --> 04:23.938
who don't have anybody
looking out for them.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.423
But Ty has me, and I have you... 

04:26.458 --> 04:27.541
or at least I thought I did.

04:27.576 --> 04:28.692
Okay, that's not fair.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.644
If this were Toby, you
wouldn't even be thinking twice.

04:30.678 --> 04:32.680
<i>You'd do anything to make it happen.</i>

04:32.714 --> 04:35.182
So is this because you think it's unethical

04:35.200 --> 04:37.318
or because he's dating me?

04:37.352 --> 04:39.286
Come on, Bay. (Sighs deeply)

04:39.321 --> 04:40.321
<i>Bay: That's what it is, isn't it?</i>

04:42.023 --> 04:43.924
You want Ty as far away as possible.

04:43.959 --> 04:45.976
Well, don't worry. It looks
like you're gonna get your wish.

04:46.011 --> 04:47.978
- (Sighs)
- Honey.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.048
Welcome home. (Clears throat)

04:53.852 --> 04:58.782
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:01.176 --> 05:03.027
So could you do something about Ty

05:03.061 --> 05:04.728
if you wanted to?

05:04.779 --> 05:07.031
Yeah, I guess I could call
in a favor with General Riken.

05:09.067 --> 05:10.951
I just can't believe Bay wasn't home

05:10.986 --> 05:15.122
one night before asking me
to help her boyfriend go awol.

05:15.156 --> 05:16.957
Yeah, well, you remember how hard

05:16.992 --> 05:19.793
it was last time Ty was deployed?

05:19.828 --> 05:22.796
I think it's gonna be worse this time.

05:22.831 --> 05:24.031
Why's it gonna be worse?

05:24.049 --> 05:26.967
Because I think they're a lot more serious.

05:27.002 --> 05:28.135
You know?

05:28.169 --> 05:29.970
(Groaning) Oh, no.

05:30.005 --> 05:32.139
Come on. She's 17. What
do you think they're doing?

05:32.173 --> 05:34.892
Just holding hands?

05:34.926 --> 05:36.727
Oh, hi.

05:36.761 --> 05:38.879
You're not dressed for work.

05:38.897 --> 05:40.931
I actually wanted to
talk to you about that.

05:40.982 --> 05:43.717
Um, would you be really mad

05:43.735 --> 05:46.053
if I ended my internship early?

05:46.104 --> 05:48.105
Like today?

05:48.156 --> 05:49.890
Why? Is something wrong?

05:49.908 --> 05:51.909
Well, Jace and I broke up

05:51.943 --> 05:54.895
and his coffee cart's
right outside the office.

05:54.913 --> 05:56.080
It's really awkward.

05:56.114 --> 05:58.949
But, honey, you are doing a fantastic job.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.752
And there's a lot of great things
happening in the next couple weeks.

06:01.786 --> 06:03.787
Well, actually, I wouldn't
mind some time off.

06:03.838 --> 06:05.706
Get some swimming in,

06:05.740 --> 06:07.675
hang out before senior year starts.

06:08.927 --> 06:10.794
Let her have some fun.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.715
Really? Huh.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.716
Okay.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.634
Thank you!

06:19.721 --> 06:21.638
You are turning this place

06:21.690 --> 06:22.806
into a sweat lodge.

06:22.857 --> 06:24.091
Babies get cold.

06:24.109 --> 06:25.926
That's why they've got all those cute PJs

06:25.944 --> 06:27.111
with the feet attached.

06:27.145 --> 06:29.813
<i>(Doorbell rings)</i>

06:29.864 --> 06:31.031
Here she is.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.032
(Sighs deeply)

06:33.785 --> 06:34.768
Angelo Sorrento?

06:34.786 --> 06:36.820
I have a very special delivery for you.

06:36.871 --> 06:38.655
(Quietly) Thank you.

06:38.707 --> 06:39.656
(Normal voice) Thank you.

06:39.708 --> 06:40.741
Please come in.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.910
I'll just need you to sign a few papers.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.778
Okay. Whatever you need.

06:44.796 --> 06:45.779
Okay.

06:49.050 --> 06:50.084
Can I hold her?

06:50.118 --> 06:51.835
Of course.

06:51.886 --> 06:52.920
Okay.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.839
Ohh. (Gasps, exhales)

06:55.890 --> 06:59.093
I forgot how delicious they are.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.844
You should see her smile.

07:00.895 --> 07:01.929
(Chuckles)

07:01.963 --> 07:03.931
Oh, let me see.

07:03.965 --> 07:04.982
Let me see.

07:05.016 --> 07:07.935
(Gasps) Hi. Hi.

07:07.969 --> 07:10.104
You are gorgeous.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.855
- Gorgeous!
- (Baby giggles)

07:11.906 --> 07:13.807
I can't believe she's finally here... 

07:13.825 --> 07:14.992
with us.

07:15.026 --> 07:16.910
<i>- Regina: Ohh, how sweet... 
- (Baby coos)</i>

07:16.945 --> 07:19.663
<i>Jennice: This place is killer.</i>

07:19.697 --> 07:21.999
I drive by houses like this
all the time on my way to work

07:22.033 --> 07:24.918
and I always wondered what
they looked like inside.

07:24.953 --> 07:27.087
Oh, thank you. We've been here forever.

07:27.122 --> 07:30.758
Seriously, Nik and I can fit
our whole house in this room.

07:31.843 --> 07:33.010
<i>Okay, wow!</i>

07:33.044 --> 07:35.846
I don't even know what I would do

07:35.880 --> 07:36.964
with all this kitchen!

07:38.933 --> 07:40.968
And everything's stainless steel.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.970
Should we talk about the menu?

07:43.004 --> 07:45.722
Yes. Yes, let's do that.

07:45.774 --> 07:48.725
Since we're having barbecue
for the rehearsal dinner,

07:48.777 --> 07:51.111
I was thinking we'd have chicken and greens

07:51.146 --> 07:52.679
<i>for the reception.</i>

07:52.697 --> 07:53.781
<i>Keep it simple like you wanted.</i>

07:53.815 --> 07:55.582
Everybody loves chicken. Great idea.

07:55.616 --> 07:56.883
Yeah... but, I mean,

07:56.901 --> 07:58.685
you could have chicken any night, right?

07:58.719 --> 08:00.671
They put it in lean cuisine.

08:00.705 --> 08:02.723
(Chuckles) Chicken is fine.

08:02.757 --> 08:05.392
I was thinking that we could do seafood,

08:05.426 --> 08:08.295
like lobsters, crab, sushi.

08:08.329 --> 08:10.564
Uh, well, you know, it's kinda hard to get

08:10.582 --> 08:14.067
good seafood in Kansas
City on short notice.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.103
I know, I know. So I went online... 

08:16.137 --> 08:18.205
the oysters come from New Hampshire.

08:18.239 --> 08:19.339
On dry ice. They just fly them out... 

08:19.373 --> 08:21.141
(Snaps fingers) overnight.

08:21.159 --> 08:23.277
So we're gonna pay for oysters
to have their own plane ticket?

08:23.311 --> 08:25.128
(Laughs)

08:25.180 --> 08:27.014
Yeah, and I thought,
you know, we could hire

08:27.048 --> 08:29.183
bartenders to do those specialty cocktails

08:29.217 --> 08:31.101
and cute little wine
bottles for party favors.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.936
Yeah, I don't think
they're called party favors.

08:32.986 --> 08:34.554
<i>Jennice: Nik,</i>

08:34.589 --> 08:36.590
I just want you to have
the best wedding possible.

08:36.624 --> 08:37.857
Right, because that's
what this is all about... 

08:37.892 --> 08:38.859
what's best for me.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.594
Yeah, it is.

08:40.628 --> 08:42.613
Please. Everything you've done,

08:42.647 --> 08:44.531
every decision you've
made has been for you.

08:49.454 --> 08:50.404
I'll go talk to her.

08:52.207 --> 08:53.506
(Sighs)

08:57.028 --> 08:58.178
She's just stressed.

08:58.213 --> 08:59.947
You know, the planning.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.083
Of course. It's a stressful time.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.087

10:22.931 --> 10:25.065
Pretty much. (Laughs)

10:25.132 --> 10:27.918
If he can't handle potato
chip crumbs on his couch,

10:27.952 --> 10:29.937
I don't know what he's gonna
do when a screaming, crying

10:29.971 --> 10:31.772
little poop maker moves in.

10:31.806 --> 10:33.874
<i>(Daphne laughs) Hey.</i>

10:33.908 --> 10:34.841
Hey.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.911
What could you possibly be glum about?

10:37.946 --> 10:40.714
Your baby sister has returned.

10:40.748 --> 10:42.599
Sorry.

10:42.634 --> 10:45.452
Just, uh, stuff with Nikki.

10:45.486 --> 10:46.503
Welcome back.

10:46.537 --> 10:48.355
What's going on with Nikki?

10:49.557 --> 10:53.260
They found the guy that murdered her dad.

10:53.294 --> 10:55.345
- Oh my God.
- Oh no.

10:55.396 --> 10:58.031
Yeah, not so great timing.

10:58.049 --> 10:59.983
And she's got something
going on with her mom,

11:00.018 --> 11:02.102
and she's cutting herself off

11:02.120 --> 11:04.237
from her church friends.

11:04.272 --> 11:07.190
Well, maybe she just needs to
get out of her head a little bit,

11:07.241 --> 11:09.926
- have some fun.
- I know, I've been trying.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.762
Is she having a bachelorette party?

11:11.813 --> 11:13.013
Uh, I don't think so.

11:13.031 --> 11:15.549
She is now.

11:15.583 --> 11:16.850
(Snorts) She is?

11:18.603 --> 11:20.620
Oh no!

11:20.654 --> 11:22.756
I mean, do churchy people

11:22.790 --> 11:24.491
even go in for bachelorette parties?

11:24.525 --> 11:26.326
<i>Come on, we don't have to have</i>

11:26.361 --> 11:28.512
a penis pinata, but we
can still have some fun.

11:28.563 --> 11:31.615
Uh, please don't have a penis anything.

11:31.666 --> 11:34.501
Maybe you can throw the party

11:34.519 --> 11:36.103
and I can stay home?

11:36.137 --> 11:38.338
What?! We haven't been
out together all summer.

11:38.373 --> 11:40.440
And school's almost here.

11:40.475 --> 11:42.943
We need to have a girls' night out.

11:45.063 --> 11:46.813
Christian bachelorette party.

11:46.848 --> 11:48.749
(Weak laugh)

11:48.783 --> 11:49.949
(Dryly) Whoo-hoo.

11:53.522 --> 11:55.557
I've been out with him three times

11:55.591 --> 11:57.659
and still no... 

11:57.693 --> 11:59.377
- Kissing?
- Kissing.

11:59.411 --> 12:01.429
No kissing. (Exhales)

12:01.463 --> 12:03.431
I'm sure it'll happen soon.

12:03.465 --> 12:05.366
(Sarcastically) Yeah, me too.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.235
What are you doing tonight?

12:07.269 --> 12:08.670
Daphne and I are... well... 

12:08.704 --> 12:13.241
throwing this bachelorette
party for my brother's fiancée.

12:13.275 --> 12:14.408
You wanna come with?

12:14.426 --> 12:17.362
Why not? It sounds fun.

12:17.413 --> 12:19.080
Excellent.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.131
- I'll text you.
- Okay.

12:23.018 --> 12:24.919
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

12:24.954 --> 12:26.137
Well, you weren't answering your phone.

12:26.171 --> 12:28.790
Yeah, 'cause I'm not
supposed to have it at work.

12:28.824 --> 12:29.908
So, Ty... 

12:29.942 --> 12:31.759
is that short for Tyler, Tyrone?

12:31.794 --> 12:32.894
Tyler, why?

12:32.928 --> 12:35.663
I need his full name and rank.

12:35.698 --> 12:36.881
Does that mean you're gonna make a call?

12:36.932 --> 12:38.516
I'm gonna see what I can do.

12:38.567 --> 12:39.601
(Shrieks)

12:39.635 --> 12:41.786
Mmm! I love you.

12:41.837 --> 12:43.421
I'm sorry for everything that I said.

12:43.472 --> 12:44.505
Seriously, you're the best.

12:44.523 --> 12:46.641
Bay, I need you to
understand something, okay?

12:46.675 --> 12:49.277
This is a real long shot.

12:49.311 --> 12:50.545
- You got that, right?
- I understand.

12:50.579 --> 12:53.164
Okay. I'll see you later.

12:56.385 --> 13:00.088
I'm really embarrassed that you had
to see Nikki and I fight like that.

13:00.122 --> 13:01.956
Oh, don't give it a second thought.

13:01.991 --> 13:03.958
You should see some of the
doozies Bay and I have had

13:03.993 --> 13:05.994
- throughout the years.
- (Both chuckle)

13:06.028 --> 13:09.047
Well, anyway, I think I found
a way to make our lives easier.

13:09.098 --> 13:10.982
Huh.

13:11.033 --> 13:12.834
- I dug this up.
- Oh.

13:12.868 --> 13:14.636
(Chuckles) What is it?

13:14.670 --> 13:17.538
After Nikki was the flower
girl at my sister's wedding,

13:17.573 --> 13:19.874
she became obsessed with planning her own.

13:19.908 --> 13:20.842
Look, she was six.

13:20.876 --> 13:22.593
(Gasps) She's adorable!

13:22.645 --> 13:23.561
<i>Isn't she?</i>

13:23.612 --> 13:24.712
Ohh.

13:24.747 --> 13:27.298
Now we don't have to
guess at what she wants.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.151
I mean, some of these ideas
are a little silly, granted... 

13:30.185 --> 13:32.119
you know, like the pumpkin-shaped carriage,

13:32.137 --> 13:34.055
the trumpeters, swans.

13:34.073 --> 13:35.189
It was a Cinderella phase.

13:35.224 --> 13:37.392
But I made a list of some of her ideas

13:37.426 --> 13:39.360
that seemed a little more doable.

13:39.395 --> 13:41.195
Great.

13:41.229 --> 13:42.930
Ahh.

13:42.965 --> 13:45.099
Apparently swans can be dangerous

13:45.134 --> 13:47.118
and, like, attack. But how pretty

13:47.152 --> 13:50.071
would peacocks look roaming
around that lawn of yours?

13:50.105 --> 13:52.607
Very.

13:52.701 --> 13:56.821
But, you know, Nikki hasn't
wanted any of these things.

13:56.872 --> 13:58.873
That's just because you can't
have peacocks in the church.

13:58.907 --> 14:00.808
But now that we're
doing the wedding here... 

14:00.843 --> 14:03.378
I mean, we can go all out.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.315
Here's the thing... um... 

14:07.349 --> 14:10.518
to get all of the stuff on this list

14:10.552 --> 14:14.155
at such short notice would be very... 

14:14.189 --> 14:15.256
difficult.

14:15.290 --> 14:19.077
And I have talked to
Nikki and Toby extensively

14:19.111 --> 14:21.929
and they have been very
clear about what they want... 

14:21.964 --> 14:23.231
simple, no fuss.

14:23.265 --> 14:25.233
That's just that youth group stuff.

14:25.267 --> 14:27.001
- (Sighs)
- Trust me.

14:27.019 --> 14:28.803
When Nikki walks down the aisle,

14:28.821 --> 14:29.904
she's gonna be thrilled.

14:29.938 --> 14:31.706
Are you sure?

14:31.740 --> 14:32.974
You think I don't know my own daughter?

14:33.008 --> 14:34.609
Of course you do.

14:34.643 --> 14:37.595
Well then, what? I'm just
pushing all this for me?

14:37.646 --> 14:40.448
You think I care about
pear tarts or whatever?

14:40.482 --> 14:42.350
- Because I don't.
- Sure seems like you do.

14:42.384 --> 14:45.403
Oh, so I'm a gold digger
trying to spend your money.

14:45.437 --> 14:47.522
You know Nikki didn't even know
Toby's last name when they met.

14:49.291 --> 14:50.324
Jennice, please.

14:50.359 --> 14:52.243
You know what? It's fine, really.

14:52.277 --> 14:54.212
I will just show up and I'll be grateful.

15:00.202 --> 15:01.869
(Baby crying)

15:01.904 --> 15:03.821
<i>* ah les crococo, les
crococo, les crocodiles *</i>

15:03.856 --> 15:05.239
<i>* sur les bords du Nil ils sont
partis n'en parlons plus... *</i>

15:05.257 --> 15:07.809
I think I prefer the crying to that song.

15:07.843 --> 15:08.843
You think she's hungry?

15:08.877 --> 15:11.712
- She just ate! Gas?
- I burped her.

15:11.747 --> 15:13.881
Oh, what about the vacuum?
That always worked with Daphne.

15:13.899 --> 15:16.517
That's right, she loved it. Mine
is in the hall in the closet.

15:16.552 --> 15:17.752
I know where the vacuum is.

15:17.786 --> 15:18.769
I never would have guessed!

15:18.804 --> 15:20.555
<i>Very funny!</i>

15:20.589 --> 15:23.758
(Sings in French)

15:23.792 --> 15:25.643
I think something is wrong.

15:25.694 --> 15:28.196
She's just over-tired.

15:28.230 --> 15:29.564
Maybe I should call the doctor.

15:31.266 --> 15:32.400
(Vacuum whirring)

15:32.434 --> 15:35.069
(Continues singing)

15:35.103 --> 15:37.038
(Crying ceases)

15:38.440 --> 15:40.975
(Sighs, chuckles)

15:41.009 --> 15:42.226
Just like Daphne.

15:42.261 --> 15:45.012
Ohh.

15:48.016 --> 15:50.067
<i>(Dance music playing)</i>

15:52.998 --> 15:54.915
Oh, almost there.

16:00.038 --> 16:03.757
- Surprise!
- Welcome to your bachelorette party.

16:03.775 --> 16:05.726
Ohh... 

16:05.761 --> 16:08.462
Wow, thank you, guys.

16:08.497 --> 16:09.780
Fun.

16:13.669 --> 16:16.570
We have got a scavenger hunt

16:16.588 --> 16:19.506
and pin-the-veil-on-the-bride.
And I almost forgot... 

16:19.524 --> 16:22.109
your tiara.

16:22.144 --> 16:24.111
- Ohh.
- Aww!

16:24.146 --> 16:25.212
(Mary Beth chuckles)

16:25.247 --> 16:27.331
And they've got really
good appetizers here.

16:27.366 --> 16:28.949
We're gonna get a menu!

16:28.984 --> 16:30.935
Okay.

16:32.988 --> 16:34.138
(Sighs deeply)

16:34.172 --> 16:36.974
You guys are so nice to do this

16:37.025 --> 16:39.543
and I'm just being a big wet blanket.

16:41.613 --> 16:43.697
Well, Toby was telling me what
a crappy summer you've had,

16:43.715 --> 16:46.484
and to be honest, so have I.

16:46.518 --> 16:49.370
So let's just try to put it all aside

16:49.404 --> 16:51.389
and have a great time tonight.

16:51.423 --> 16:53.274
What do you say?

16:53.308 --> 16:56.510
<i>- (Pop music playing)
- I love this song! Whoo!</i>

16:56.545 --> 16:58.179
<i>- (Laughs)
- (Nikki shouts)</i>

16:58.213 --> 17:00.114
(Cheers)

17:01.383 --> 17:03.300
Whoo!

17:03.351 --> 17:05.152
Girl knows how to have fun.

17:06.204 --> 17:07.972
<i>Nikki: Whoo!</i>

17:08.006 --> 17:09.890
(Chuckles)

17:13.962 --> 17:15.522
Ha ha ha, nice!

17:15.523 --> 17:17.765
- ___
- Well.

17:18.464 --> 17:20.935
___

17:20.935 --> 17:23.570
Uh, no. He's not coming.

17:23.571 --> 17:25.478
___

17:25.707 --> 17:28.676
(Sighs) He basically said that... 

17:28.710 --> 17:30.611
I was making a huge mistake.

17:30.629 --> 17:34.665
And I don't want someone
to stand up there with me

17:34.699 --> 17:37.318
who doesn't support me.

17:38.453 --> 17:41.188
So, I actually... 

17:41.223 --> 17:44.225
need a new best man.

17:45.150 --> 17:47.264
___

17:47.813 --> 17:48.763
Yeah.

17:51.204 --> 17:54.641
___

17:54.642 --> 17:56.429
___

17:56.905 --> 17:58.672
Wait.

17:58.707 --> 18:00.641
So you don't support me either?

18:00.659 --> 18:02.443
Well, that's great. I mean... 

18:02.444 --> 18:05.424
___

18:05.425 --> 18:08.597
___

18:10.370 --> 18:11.925
___

18:12.187 --> 18:13.420
Perfect.

18:13.455 --> 18:14.455
<i>(Cellphone ringing)</i>

18:19.044 --> 18:20.961
(Sighs)

18:20.996 --> 18:22.313
Hello.

18:25.033 --> 18:25.950
Okay?

18:29.070 --> 18:30.104
Wait, what?

18:30.138 --> 18:31.772
You gotta be kidding me!

18:34.643 --> 18:36.443
Uh, yeah.

18:36.478 --> 18:37.778
I think he should know too.

18:39.481 --> 18:41.549
Actually, he's sitting right next to me.

18:43.318 --> 18:45.553
Yeah, sure. I can tell him.

18:47.122 --> 18:49.089
Well, thanks for letting me know.

18:50.192 --> 18:52.293
(Scoffs) I'm sure you are.

18:52.327 --> 18:54.128
All right, bye.

18:54.162 --> 18:57.164
Ahh, well. That was Simone.

18:57.199 --> 18:59.099
(Chuckles) You're gonna love this.

19:00.936 --> 19:01.869
I... 

19:03.037 --> 19:04.722
I don't even know how to spell it.

19:06.641 --> 19:08.542
She has, uh... 

19:09.995 --> 19:11.612
<i>(Cellphone chimes) ___</i>

19:11.646 --> 19:13.848
And, um... I don't know the sign.

19:13.882 --> 19:17.418
Um, she doesn't know,
how long she's had it.

19:17.452 --> 19:20.571
So she thinks that I should get tested.

19:21.890 --> 19:25.284
___

19:26.261 --> 19:27.461
Yeah.

19:28.496 --> 19:30.097
(Sighs)

19:31.233 --> 19:32.166
(Sighs)

19:34.950 --> 19:36.051
Oh, you are a lifesaver.

19:36.085 --> 19:38.904
There's a little bit
of everything in here... 

19:38.955 --> 19:41.056
blankets, sleep sacks.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.008
I pretty much saved everything from when

19:43.059 --> 19:44.776
Bay and Toby were little.

19:44.827 --> 19:47.045
I'm so sorry to bother you so late.

19:47.096 --> 19:50.615
Please. I needed a break from this wedding.

19:50.666 --> 19:52.851
This feels like a problem I can fix.

19:52.885 --> 19:55.820
I find it hard to believe there's a
wedding problem that you can't fix.

19:55.855 --> 19:57.656
Wait. Do you have a second?

19:57.707 --> 19:59.474
I'm... 

19:59.508 --> 20:01.526
Nikki's mom, who's a lovely person,

20:01.577 --> 20:03.161
but doesn't have much to contribute... 

20:03.212 --> 20:06.064
which is fine... was really pushing for

20:06.115 --> 20:07.348
all these over-the-top things.

20:07.366 --> 20:11.086
And I... I said no, and she flipped out.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.054
But up until a week ago,

20:13.089 --> 20:14.089
this was what they wanted... 

20:14.123 --> 20:16.090
a simple wedding in a church basement.

20:16.108 --> 20:18.159
And all of a sudden,
her mom wants this, uh... 

20:18.194 --> 20:22.013
Cinderella fantasy for a six-year-old.

20:22.064 --> 20:22.998
Why?

20:24.867 --> 20:26.902
I think she might be overcompensating.

20:26.936 --> 20:29.588
Overcompensating for what?

20:29.622 --> 20:32.607
Her dad was murdered for buying drugs?!

20:32.642 --> 20:34.542
Selling, actually.

20:34.576 --> 20:35.677
The point is

20:35.778 --> 20:38.280
Nikki's mom wants to
throw money at the wedding

20:38.314 --> 20:40.198
to make up for the fact
that Nikki just found out... 

20:40.233 --> 20:43.151
I get it, I get it. Our son
is marrying into a drug cartel.

20:43.186 --> 20:45.520
Honey, we can't judge until
we know the whole situation.

20:45.555 --> 20:48.457
I am pretty sure that you
can judge drug dealing.

20:48.491 --> 20:53.028
Well, apparently Nikki had
no idea about any of this

20:53.046 --> 20:55.797
until they went to visit that guy in jail.

20:55.832 --> 20:58.083
And now she's furious with
her mother for not telling her.

20:58.117 --> 20:59.134
Okay, and live doves and ice sculptures

20:59.168 --> 21:00.135
are supposed to make up for that?

21:00.169 --> 21:02.738
Remember what Regina went through

21:02.772 --> 21:05.574
when Daphne found out that she knew
about the switch and didn't tell her?

21:05.608 --> 21:06.742
I mean, she must be spinning.

21:06.809 --> 21:09.461
Well, could she please spin
out on somebody else's budget?

21:10.797 --> 21:12.614
(All laughing)

21:12.648 --> 21:14.366
All right, girls.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.785
I scored some more drinks
from that bachelor party.

21:16.803 --> 21:18.586
- Whoo!
- (Chuckles)

21:18.604 --> 21:21.573
Okay, everybody, take a dare from the boot.

21:21.607 --> 21:23.191
Bay: Okay

21:23.226 --> 21:25.310
let's see, let's see.

21:25.344 --> 21:26.528
(All laughing)

21:26.562 --> 21:28.163
Come on!

21:28.197 --> 21:29.381
- Hey!
- (Grunts)

21:31.017 --> 21:33.101
"Ask a stranger for a condom."

21:33.119 --> 21:34.236
<i>- Ooh.
- (Chuckles)</i>

21:34.270 --> 21:36.171
- Ooh.
- "Get a hot guy's phone number."

21:36.189 --> 21:38.807
"Get a guy to give you his underwear."

21:38.841 --> 21:40.158
- (All laughing)
- Ooh... 

21:40.209 --> 21:42.711
Uh... "Kiss a cute boy."

21:43.813 --> 21:44.946
I'm on it!

21:44.980 --> 21:46.615
Me too!

21:46.649 --> 21:47.916
(Sputters)

21:47.934 --> 21:50.585
- What?
- (Sighs)

21:50.620 --> 21:53.555
The only boy I want to kiss isn't here.

21:53.589 --> 21:56.458
Well, Travis is at Scratch.
That's like three blocks away.

21:56.492 --> 21:57.492
- Let's go find him.
- (Chuckles weakly)

21:57.510 --> 21:58.710
I don't think he wants to kiss me.

22:00.563 --> 22:03.498
Well, now he has to.
It says so on the card.

22:03.532 --> 22:04.466
(Sternly) Bay.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.101
You said you wanted to kiss him.

22:06.135 --> 22:07.202
Let's go get you kissed.

22:11.207 --> 22:13.141
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

22:19.198 --> 22:22.768
I'm only paid till 10:00.
So is the groom coming?

22:22.802 --> 22:23.802
Or what?

22:33.596 --> 22:34.629
<i>(Cellphone vibrating)</i>

22:48.480 --> 22:50.886
___

22:51.047 --> 22:52.981
No. I wanna get this over with,

22:53.015 --> 22:55.884
get my clean bill of health and
forget that this ever happened.

22:58.154 --> 23:01.089
Says here to list your sexual partners.

23:01.123 --> 23:03.058
You wanna just copy off of me?

23:04.465 --> 23:08.357
___

23:08.358 --> 23:10.560
___

23:10.867 --> 23:12.534
Me too.

23:12.552 --> 23:13.835
And yet here we are.

23:21.344 --> 23:23.411
I need a urine sample.
Bathroom's down the hall.

23:25.548 --> 23:28.349
Best bachelor party ever.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.285
<i>(Pop music playing)</i>

23:33.089 --> 23:35.157
25, baby!

23:35.191 --> 23:37.759
(Both chuckle)

23:37.777 --> 23:39.060
- Great job.
- What are you doing?

23:39.095 --> 23:40.862
No. Nuh-uh. No phones.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.031
Nuh-uh. You are the one that was like,

23:43.121 --> 23:45.122
"we gotta get out of our heads.

23:45.157 --> 23:46.874
We gotta have fun for one night."

23:46.925 --> 23:48.792
What's going on?

23:48.810 --> 23:49.961
Nothing.

23:49.995 --> 23:52.563
Come on.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.832
You and I, we're going
to be family in one week.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.751
We're going to be sisters.

23:56.802 --> 23:59.320
- That is true.
- Don't worry.

23:59.371 --> 24:01.405
I'm not gonna remember
a thing tomorrow anyway.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.225
(Deeply exhales)

24:04.276 --> 24:07.178
It's your party. I don't wanna get into it.

24:10.415 --> 24:14.218
I don't care about my party.

24:14.252 --> 24:15.820
I care about you.

24:18.941 --> 24:21.909
(Sighs) You know Chip Coto?

24:21.960 --> 24:22.960
Yeah.

24:22.995 --> 24:25.663
The coffee guy and I... 

24:25.697 --> 24:28.532
blackmailed him into changing his vote

24:28.567 --> 24:29.800
for the abstinence-only bill.

24:29.818 --> 24:31.702
(Gasps)

24:38.210 --> 24:39.543
<i>- Can I come in?
- Yeah.</i>

24:39.578 --> 24:41.145
Sorry, they... 

24:41.179 --> 24:43.197
they said Kennish and I thought it was... 

24:43.248 --> 24:45.299
Nope. Not Bay.

24:47.219 --> 24:50.087
You must know what a big deal this is... 

24:51.857 --> 24:53.090
for me to pull a string,

24:53.125 --> 24:54.191
get you out of your commitment.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.027
I do.

24:56.061 --> 24:57.962
I happen to believe that
you should follow through

24:57.996 --> 24:59.764
when you say you're gonna do something.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.699
So do I.

25:03.535 --> 25:06.370
You're not making a very
compelling case for yourself.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.289
Don't get me wrong. I wanna be with her,

25:09.458 --> 25:13.577
but if I did somehow get
myself stationed locally... 

25:13.611 --> 25:15.363
I don't know what I would tell the guys.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.384
This is a lot more complicated for me.

25:20.419 --> 25:23.204
- You don't wanna disappoint her.
- (Quietly) No.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.892
Wait till you're a parent.

25:28.927 --> 25:30.828
It gets about 100 times harder.

25:30.862 --> 25:31.962
(Chuckles)

25:34.566 --> 25:35.683
Okay.

25:36.835 --> 25:37.868
(Clears throat)

25:40.472 --> 25:42.373
Um, I'm sorry if... 

25:42.407 --> 25:44.274
I confused you with this.

25:44.292 --> 25:45.559
No.

25:45.594 --> 25:46.543
Very helpful.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.235
It's good to see you.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.354
You too.

26:04.175 --> 26:05.458
<i>He is an awful guy.</i>

26:05.493 --> 26:07.410
Pretty awful.

26:09.046 --> 26:12.148
So... that's it?

26:12.166 --> 26:14.084
No one is going to find out?

26:14.118 --> 26:16.018
It's over. It's fine.

26:16.036 --> 26:18.088
No, Daphne. Everyone needs to know

26:18.122 --> 26:19.222
what a liar he is.

26:19.256 --> 26:21.691
I'm not gonna tell anyone,

26:21.726 --> 26:23.076
and neither are you.

26:23.127 --> 26:24.961
- (Scoffs)
- So let's just put the genie back in the bottle.

26:24.979 --> 26:27.864
- (Sighs)
- Um... 

26:27.898 --> 26:29.532
I'm gonna go get you some water.

26:38.342 --> 26:39.743
So, uh, we're just gonna
wait here for the results?

26:39.777 --> 26:41.377
You're gonna call us or... ?

26:41.412 --> 26:43.379
We'll notify you within
seven to 10 business days.

26:44.582 --> 26:47.250
No. I'm gonna need

26:47.284 --> 26:48.418
my results faster than that.

26:48.452 --> 26:50.053
Like next Friday, latest.

26:50.087 --> 26:53.022
It takes five to seven days
for the bacteria to grow.

26:53.057 --> 26:55.291
Could I pay more to put a rush on it?

26:55.309 --> 26:58.862
Even money can't rush bacteria.

26:58.896 --> 27:01.798
And you should refrain
from any sexual activity

27:01.832 --> 27:02.899
until you get your results.

27:06.737 --> 27:09.606
I'm getting married next week.

27:11.008 --> 27:12.976
Then here is a brochure

27:13.010 --> 27:14.844
on how to talk to your partner

27:14.879 --> 27:17.446
about sexually transmitted diseases.

27:17.465 --> 27:19.349
We haven't had sex.

27:19.383 --> 27:21.317
Ever.

27:21.352 --> 27:23.419
We've been waiting.

27:26.307 --> 27:27.490
Thank you, lady.

27:27.525 --> 27:29.075
Very much.

27:29.126 --> 27:30.193
And thank you, Simone.

27:30.227 --> 27:32.128
And thank you, Wilke, who probably gave it

27:32.163 --> 27:33.462
to Simone in the first place, right?

27:33.481 --> 27:36.249
And thank you, God, for
creating genital diseases.

27:36.283 --> 27:37.366
You know who the biggest
idiot of them all is?

27:37.384 --> 27:40.103
Me! For asking the guy
who screwed my girlfriend

27:40.137 --> 27:42.005
to be me best man. You know what?

27:42.039 --> 27:43.790
Maybe I should ask Simone
to walk me down the aisle.

27:43.841 --> 27:45.842
Huh! That'd be great. I'm
sure Nikki would love that.

27:45.860 --> 27:47.727
- Bring the whole family right back together.
- ___

27:47.778 --> 27:48.945
Yeah, you're right. Let's get out of here.

27:52.817 --> 27:55.818
I heard about Ty's redeployment
back to Afghanistan.

27:55.836 --> 27:57.787
Your stomach must be in knots.

27:57.821 --> 27:59.806
Actually, my dad's gonna
try to make a few calls

27:59.857 --> 28:02.525
so Ty doesn't have to go back over there.

28:02.560 --> 28:04.677
And Ty's okay with that?

28:04.712 --> 28:07.697
I mean, not shipping out
with the rest of his unit?

28:07.731 --> 28:09.365
Well, he wasn't at first, but... 

28:10.618 --> 28:12.468
Are you okay?

28:12.503 --> 28:15.205
Yeah. Fine.

28:15.239 --> 28:17.340
Don't be nervous. You
look extremely kissable.

28:17.374 --> 28:19.225
(Chuckles)

28:20.361 --> 28:22.345
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

28:36.960 --> 28:38.645
It's a bachelor party.

28:38.679 --> 28:39.696
He's dancing with a girl.

28:40.998 --> 28:43.867
I've been racking my brain... 

28:43.901 --> 28:46.469
wondering why he hasn't kissed me.

28:46.503 --> 28:48.621
Do you know what Occam's razor is?

28:48.672 --> 28:49.756
No.

28:49.807 --> 28:53.409
It means when you're looking
for the answer to a problem,

28:53.444 --> 28:56.312
it's usually the most obvious one.

29:00.251 --> 29:02.352
I don't know what you're talking about.

29:02.386 --> 29:04.320
Really?

29:04.355 --> 29:06.188
'Cause it seems pretty obvious to me

29:06.206 --> 29:08.308
that what he wants is a lingerie model,

29:08.342 --> 29:09.959
like all guys.

29:11.145 --> 29:12.295
That's ridiculous.

29:12.329 --> 29:14.864
You just have to march over
there and plant one on him.

29:14.899 --> 29:17.033
Is that right? Is that what I have to do?

29:17.067 --> 29:18.285
Yeah.

29:18.286 --> 29:19.987
Because you always know
what's right for everyone.

29:20.070 --> 29:22.138
I... I didn't say that.

29:22.172 --> 29:24.974
How could you ask Ty to
give up his platoon for you?

29:24.992 --> 29:27.810
I'm trying to keep him out of a war zone.

29:27.845 --> 29:30.747
I thought with what
happened to your brother

29:30.781 --> 29:33.649
- you'd be happy... 
- Justin was injured and sent home.

29:33.667 --> 29:35.418
He was on the couch watching TV

29:35.436 --> 29:38.404
while they were on the front
line. That made him crazy.

29:38.455 --> 29:40.723
You don't ask someone in the
military to do what you're asking.

29:40.758 --> 29:43.559
I'm sorry about what
happened to your brother,

29:43.593 --> 29:46.329
but what's gonna kill Ty
is not sitting on a couch;

29:46.363 --> 29:48.548
it's being in a country with
people who want to kill him.

29:48.599 --> 29:50.266
I should've never come out tonight.

29:58.108 --> 30:00.209
You are not going to get away with this.

30:02.980 --> 30:04.180
Who was that?

30:04.214 --> 30:06.782
Uh, Chip Coto.

30:08.152 --> 30:09.786
What do you mean?

30:09.820 --> 30:11.888
I called his office and
left him a voice-mail.

30:11.922 --> 30:12.889
I told him off.

30:12.923 --> 30:14.590
You didn't.

30:14.625 --> 30:15.891
Yup, I did.

30:15.909 --> 30:16.926
(Chuckles)

30:16.961 --> 30:18.711
He's totally gonna pee his pants.

30:18.762 --> 30:22.398
Nikki, please... please tell me
that you did not do that, please.

30:22.416 --> 30:24.400
He can't just get away with it.

30:24.435 --> 30:26.402
I had a deal with Chip Coto!

30:26.437 --> 30:28.204
If he thinks I'm running
around telling people,

30:28.238 --> 30:29.605
he's gonna take me out
like a Cuban missile!

30:29.640 --> 30:30.257
What?

30:30.258 --> 30:32.691
Why can't people stay away
from phones with this guy?

30:33.143 --> 30:34.410
Why would you do that?

30:34.444 --> 30:36.262
Why would you screw me over like that?

30:36.296 --> 30:38.264
What in the world would make you

30:38.315 --> 30:41.217
wanna pick up a phone and call him?!

30:45.789 --> 30:46.956
I don't know.

30:46.990 --> 30:50.059
We need to fix this. We
need to fix this like now!

30:57.003 --> 30:59.905
How are we going to get into his office?

30:59.939 --> 31:01.991
If you're saying
something, I can't hear you.

31:02.025 --> 31:02.975
Right.

31:09.749 --> 31:10.716
Oh.

31:11.751 --> 31:12.685
Try that.

31:17.924 --> 31:19.425
You know what, let me... 

31:19.459 --> 31:21.360
Maybe I can find a letter
opener, or something.

31:21.394 --> 31:23.328
- See if we can pry it open.
- Sure.

31:24.797 --> 31:27.232
(Lock rattling)

31:27.267 --> 31:28.200
Come on.

31:28.234 --> 31:30.436
Come on.

31:33.239 --> 31:34.373
Come on.

31:34.407 --> 31:35.374
What do you think you're doing?

31:37.327 --> 31:38.276
Are you listening to me?

31:38.294 --> 31:40.179
Wait! Oh, my gosh!

31:40.213 --> 31:41.213
She's... she's deaf.

31:43.216 --> 31:45.050
Sir, uh... 

31:45.085 --> 31:46.718
I'm really sorry. I know
we shouldn't be here,

31:46.736 --> 31:49.021
but I really screwed something
up and if I don't fix it,

31:49.055 --> 31:50.856
- I'm gonna get fired.
- What do you have to fix?

31:51.891 --> 31:53.592
He's asking what we need to fix.

31:53.626 --> 31:56.695
Uh, we were in the car together

31:56.729 --> 31:58.697
and she was leaving a
voice-mail for our boss

31:58.732 --> 32:01.467
and I thought she'd hung up... 

32:01.501 --> 32:02.701
But I have a hands-free

32:02.736 --> 32:04.520
and I hadn't hung up yet.

32:04.571 --> 32:07.306
And I said some things about our boss.

32:07.340 --> 32:09.475
Yeah. And it turns out the
whole thing got recorded.

32:11.244 --> 32:13.095
Could you please do us the biggest favor

32:13.129 --> 32:15.013
in the whole world and unlock the door,

32:15.048 --> 32:16.215
so I could delete the message?

32:16.249 --> 32:18.917
I honestly don't think it would do anybody

32:18.951 --> 32:20.135
any good for him to hear it.

32:20.170 --> 32:22.254
- (Sighs)
- Nikki: Please.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.089
Okay, but nobody can know about this.

32:24.124 --> 32:26.141
- He said okay.
- Thank you.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.194
___

32:30.830 --> 32:32.931
I dragged her here to kiss you

32:32.966 --> 32:35.701
and she saw you tangoing with that girl.

32:36.675 --> 32:38.111
___

32:38.112 --> 32:39.571
Not helping!

32:39.572 --> 32:41.193
___

32:41.658 --> 32:44.426
True, but I don't think the fact

32:44.461 --> 32:46.678
that she's a size zero helped.

32:46.679 --> 32:49.230
___

32:49.231 --> 32:49.794
She does.

32:49.795 --> 32:52.157
She thinks that's why you
haven't kissed her yet.

32:53.070 --> 32:56.084
___

32:59.065 --> 33:02.969
___

33:03.163 --> 33:04.329
Well, if you kiss her,

33:04.347 --> 33:07.098
that'll probably make
the moment pretty special.

33:09.335 --> 33:11.904
You know what the password is, right?

33:11.938 --> 33:14.106
Yeah, they usually keep them right here.

33:15.742 --> 33:16.658
Jackpot.

It's gone.

34:16.168 --> 34:19.237
I kinda lost it tonight, huh?

34:21.139 --> 34:23.074
It's okay.

34:23.109 --> 34:26.911
I think I'm just really sad... 

34:26.946 --> 34:30.014
that my dad isn't gonna be
there to walk me down the aisle.

34:32.735 --> 34:36.655
And I'm not even mad at him anymore.

34:36.688 --> 34:38.657
I'm just... 

34:38.690 --> 34:39.875
just sad.

34:42.929 --> 34:44.862
You're gonna get a new family now.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.601
We're gonna be sisters.

34:55.658 --> 34:59.177
- She's down.
- Hmm.

34:59.211 --> 35:01.313
Please let her stay asleep.

35:01.331 --> 35:03.148
(Chuckles)

35:03.166 --> 35:05.417
Remember the first few months with Daphne?

35:05.435 --> 35:07.152
We were total zombies.

35:07.186 --> 35:09.321
Did we remember to pay the... 

35:09.339 --> 35:11.189
(Mimics snoring)

35:11.224 --> 35:12.925
(Laughs)

This is nice.

35:20.767 --> 35:22.801
Yeah. (Chuckles)

35:22.835 --> 35:24.770
It is.

35:24.804 --> 35:26.572
(Sighs)

35:34.714 --> 35:38.450
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. We said we wouldn't.

35:38.484 --> 35:39.517
(Sighs)

35:58.014 --> 35:59.865
- Nikki: Hi.
- Hey.

36:01.785 --> 36:02.885
So did you have fun?

36:02.919 --> 36:06.855
Yeah. Yeah, I did, actually.

36:06.889 --> 36:08.374
How about you?

36:08.408 --> 36:10.326
No.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.544
I didn't. (Exhales)

36:12.579 --> 36:14.246
No fun was had.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.415
Babe, what happened?

36:17.634 --> 36:20.302
Um... 

36:20.320 --> 36:23.138
there's something I need to tell you.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.076
What is it?

36:29.346 --> 36:31.280
(Inaudible)

36:56.523 --> 36:58.473
(Exhales)

___

37:18.261 --> 37:19.828
Yeah.

37:19.863 --> 37:21.797
I'd like that.

37:31.958 --> 37:36.779
It would be so easy for
us to sink back into this.

37:36.846 --> 37:39.581
I mean, it's all right here.

37:39.616 --> 37:40.599
Is that so wrong?

37:41.751 --> 37:43.719
Abby is yours,

37:43.753 --> 37:45.471
not mine.

37:46.689 --> 37:47.673
She could be ours.

37:52.245 --> 37:54.396
This baby is not a time machine.

37:56.533 --> 37:59.067
(Sighs) I'm sorry

37:59.102 --> 38:01.370
that we missed our chance
to raise a daughter together,

38:01.404 --> 38:05.090
but I did it once.

38:05.141 --> 38:07.976
And I don't wanna do it again.

38:10.213 --> 38:12.147
But... 

38:14.050 --> 38:16.935
she's gonna have a really great dad.

38:26.729 --> 38:28.480
Jennice, hi.

38:28.531 --> 38:30.415
I didn't know which entrance to use.

38:30.467 --> 38:32.534
This is perfect. (Chuckles nervously)

38:34.637 --> 38:37.706
I feel bad about how we
left things yesterday.

38:37.740 --> 38:41.460
I was thinking about it and... 

38:41.511 --> 38:43.345
peacocks would be nice.

38:43.379 --> 38:45.313
(Chuckles)

38:46.533 --> 38:49.417
Nikki told you about her dad.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.354
Actually, Regina did,

38:52.372 --> 38:55.424
and I am really sorry.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.142
You must be thrilled to have your son

38:57.177 --> 38:59.278
marrying the daughter of a meth dealer.

38:59.329 --> 39:01.363
We haven't given it a second thought.

39:01.397 --> 39:03.332
Nikki's great.

39:03.366 --> 39:05.133
Yeah.

39:05.167 --> 39:07.236
Yes.

39:07.270 --> 39:09.171
(Groaning) Oh, God, this wedding.

39:11.774 --> 39:13.692
Don't you want it to happen?

39:13.726 --> 39:14.993
No.

39:15.028 --> 39:17.779
- I mean, do you?
- Of course not!

39:17.814 --> 39:20.616
- They're way too young, right?
- It's absurd.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.034
Toby should be in college

39:22.085 --> 39:24.753
and Nikki should be just figuring out
what she wants to do with her life.

39:24.787 --> 39:25.921
That's what we think!

39:25.955 --> 39:28.423
They can be in love and not be married.

39:28.458 --> 39:29.491
Right!

39:30.660 --> 39:32.761
What are we gonna do about this thing?
