00:03.769 --> 00:06.499
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.663
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:08.841 --> 00:09.933
I'm Elena.

00:10.142 --> 00:11.507
- I'm Stefan.
- I know.

00:11.677 --> 00:14.669
- I'm Damon, Stefan's brother.
- Didn't tell me he had a brother.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.576
Being around her,
does it make you feel alive?

00:17.783 --> 00:19.546
He told me about your ex, Katherine?

00:19.718 --> 00:22.050
- She broke your heart.
- That was a long time ago.

00:22.221 --> 00:25.190
I'm gonna give you
Elena's cell number.

00:26.725 --> 00:27.783
What are you up to?

00:27.960 --> 00:30.292
That's for me to know
and you to "dot, dot, dot."

00:30.529 --> 00:32.258
I was hoping I'd see you again.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

02:11.062 --> 02:12.428
Good morning.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.258
Please. Don't.

02:17.669 --> 02:18.829
Don't do that.

02:22.841 --> 02:24.502
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:28.013 --> 02:30.504
Get away from me. No.

02:30.716 --> 02:33.514
This could have gone
a completely different way.

02:53.872 --> 02:55.032
A waste of a butt.

02:55.207 --> 02:59.610
Listen, I'm not saying don't date
the guy, I'm just saying take it slow.

02:59.845 --> 03:04.339
- You are the one who said to go for it.
- Now, I'm saying take it slow.

03:04.516 --> 03:06.677
- Why the about-face?
- It's not an about-face.

03:06.852 --> 03:09.116
You're single for the first time
in high school.

03:09.354 --> 03:13.791
- It's the perfect time to play the field.
- Oh, because I'm so that girl.

03:13.959 --> 03:16.427
- Seriously, what are you not saying?
- It's stupid.

03:17.029 --> 03:18.394
- Bonnie.
- What?

03:18.564 --> 03:22.295
- Spit it out.
- I accidentally touched Stefan...

03:22.467 --> 03:24.458
...and I got a really bad feeling.

03:26.138 --> 03:29.539
- Is that it? Bonnie.
- It was "bad" bad.

03:29.741 --> 03:33.302
- Is this the witch-mojo thing again?
- Know what? I'm just concerned.

03:33.478 --> 03:36.970
This is me expressing concern
about my best friend's new boyfriend.

03:37.149 --> 03:42.280
And I love you for it. I do.
But I feel good.

03:42.454 --> 03:45.252
It's been a hard year
and I'm starting to kind of feel...

03:45.424 --> 03:47.984
...like things are getting back
to normal again.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.220
And you know what?
Stefan is a big part of that.

03:55.634 --> 03:59.126
I rock. I scored two tickets
to the Posers Saturday night.

03:59.304 --> 04:03.331
- They're playing at The Rat.
- You and Tyler have fun.

04:03.508 --> 04:06.602
Don't be like that.
Come on. I want you to go.

04:06.812 --> 04:10.145
Not worried everyone will know
you're screwing the stoner geek? Wait.

04:10.315 --> 04:13.443
- Everyone already knows.
- Yeah, but it's not like that anymore.

04:13.652 --> 04:16.916
- So now we can be friends and hang.
- Tell me something.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.456
Was it the drugs? Were you
sleeping with me because of the drugs?

04:20.993 --> 04:23.461
- Screw you.
- Well, no. If there's another reason...

04:23.629 --> 04:24.926
...please, I'm all ears.

04:31.403 --> 04:33.200
Morning, Elena.

04:34.006 --> 04:36.474
- Morning, Bonnie.
- Hey, um, I gotta find Caroline.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.473
She's not answering her phone,
so see you guys.

04:39.678 --> 04:41.543
Bonnie, wait.

04:44.416 --> 04:46.407
She doesn't like me very much.

04:47.286 --> 04:49.516
She doesn't know you.
She's my best friend.

04:49.688 --> 04:54.648
She's just looking out for me,
but when she does, she will love you.

04:54.826 --> 04:57.818
Look. There's Elena
and her new boyfriend.

04:58.530 --> 05:03.934
And what are they doing?
Oh, they're walking, walking, walking.

05:04.136 --> 05:05.569
Yup. Right into the sunset.

05:05.737 --> 05:07.705
- You're a dick.
- While you stand there...

05:07.873 --> 05:11.240
...looking like one of those yard trolls.
- Gnomes.

05:12.477 --> 05:15.037
Here's what we're gonna do.
Are you free tonight?

05:16.548 --> 05:18.379
- Yes.
- Perfect.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.551
Dinner, my house, 8:00.

05:20.719 --> 05:23.517
You, me and Bonnie.
You two will spend some quality time.

05:23.689 --> 05:26.522
She'll see what a great guy you are.
Mission accomplished.

05:28.460 --> 05:31.520
And what am I supposed to do, Ty?
She made her choice.

05:32.397 --> 05:36.163
- Let her know she made the wrong one.
- What are you doing? Ty, don't.

05:36.368 --> 05:38.768
Ty, don't. God.

05:57.422 --> 06:00.414
That throw was insane.
I didn't know you played football.

06:00.592 --> 06:03.060
I used to. It was a long time ago.

06:03.228 --> 06:05.696
So why don't you try out
for the team?

06:05.864 --> 06:07.923
Yeah, I don't think so.

06:08.867 --> 06:12.598
- So you don't like football.
- No, I love football. It's a great sport.

06:12.804 --> 06:17.138
But in this case,
I don't think football likes me.

06:18.076 --> 06:21.045
You saw Tyler over there.
And we both know how Matt feels.

06:21.213 --> 06:25.240
They don't know you.
To them, you're a mysterious loner guy.

06:25.417 --> 06:27.647
Wouldn't hurt to be part of.
Make some friends.

06:27.819 --> 06:31.255
Says the girl who spends her alone time
writing in a cemetery.

06:31.456 --> 06:36.621
Hey. Come on. There's more to me
than just gloomy-graveyard girl.

06:36.828 --> 06:39.729
There's a whole other Elena
that you have yet to meet.

06:39.931 --> 06:42.832
- She was into everything. Very busy.
- Well, I look forward to meeting her.

06:44.202 --> 06:46.261
- And when will that be?
- Soon.

06:46.438 --> 06:48.531
She's working on it.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.038
World War II ended in?

06:55.113 --> 06:58.412
Anyone got anything? Ms. Juan?

06:59.418 --> 07:00.942
- 1945.
- Psst.

07:01.119 --> 07:03.644
FYI, our team sucks.
They could use you.

07:03.855 --> 07:04.913
Pearl Harbor.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.854
- Can't, I'm a loner.
- Nothing?

07:08.026 --> 07:10.620
- Miss Gilbert Ahem. Pearl Harbor.
- Hm?

07:11.496 --> 07:14.954
- Um...
- December 7th, 1941.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.297
Thank you, Miss Gilbert.

07:18.937 --> 07:20.268
Anytime.

07:20.806 --> 07:22.137
Very well.

07:22.307 --> 07:26.801
- The fall of the Berlin Wall.
- 1989. I'm good with dates, sir.

07:27.012 --> 07:28.309
Are you?

07:28.513 --> 07:30.344
How good?

07:31.183 --> 07:33.083
Keep it to the year.

07:33.585 --> 07:34.609
Civil Rights Act.

07:35.487 --> 07:36.818
1964.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.315
- John F. Kennedy assassination.
- 1963.

07:42.027 --> 07:43.858
- Martin Luther King.
- '68.

07:44.095 --> 07:45.619
- Lincoln.
- 1865.

07:45.831 --> 07:47.662
- Roe v. Wade?
- 1973.

07:47.866 --> 07:49.731
- Brown v. Board?
- 1954.

07:49.968 --> 07:51.993
- The Battle of Gettysburg.
- 1863.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.672
- Korean War.
- 1950 to 1953.

07:54.873 --> 07:58.468
Ha! It ended in '52. Ha-ha-ha.

07:58.643 --> 08:02.340
Uh, actually, sir, it was '53.

08:07.118 --> 08:09.518
Look it up. Somebody.

08:09.721 --> 08:13.657
- Quickly.
- It was 1953.

08:25.637 --> 08:27.036
How did you know all of that?

08:27.572 --> 08:29.403
Years and years of crossword puzzles.

08:29.574 --> 08:32.543
It's a loner thing.

08:36.248 --> 08:38.614
- Damn.
- Nice job, nice job.

08:38.783 --> 08:42.514
Mr. Lockwood, is there anything
you're good at? Because it isn't history.

08:42.687 --> 08:45.178
And it sure as hell
isn't defending the ball.

08:45.390 --> 08:47.449
- Yes, coach.
- Now, do it again.

09:11.716 --> 09:12.978
Oh, my God. You're here.

09:14.452 --> 09:16.545
Yep. I can't be sad girl forever.

09:16.755 --> 09:20.452
Only way to get things back to the way
they were, are to do things that were.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.616
- Oh. And you're coming to dinner tonight.
- Am?

09:22.794 --> 09:24.625
Mm-hm. You, me and Stefan.

09:26.398 --> 09:28.958
- You have to give him a chance.
- Tonight's no good.

09:30.335 --> 09:32.633
You seen Caroline?
I texted her a hundred times.

09:32.804 --> 09:34.999
Don't change the subject,
Bonnie Bennett.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.468
You're going to be there.

09:37.342 --> 09:40.243
- Fine, I'll go.
- Good.

09:40.412 --> 09:42.744
Varsity try-outs were last spring,
Mr. Salvatore.

09:42.914 --> 09:44.074
I wasn't here then, sir.

09:44.249 --> 09:47.275
Then you're not here now,
as far as I'm concerned.

09:47.719 --> 09:51.155
Mr. Tanner, I realize that you
and I didn't get off to the best start...

09:51.323 --> 09:53.655
...and I wanna apologize for that.

09:54.259 --> 09:56.693
I've played football before,
wide receiver, mostly.

09:56.861 --> 09:58.624
And I'm pretty good.

10:00.265 --> 10:02.961
I won't be asking you
who won the Super Bowl in '71.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.499
'71 was...

10:06.104 --> 10:08.163
Sorry. I understand that, sir.

10:09.474 --> 10:11.533
Just to see you
get knocked on your ass.

10:11.776 --> 10:13.869
Borrow some gear.

10:15.013 --> 10:18.039
Go. Before I change my mind.
Let's run it again!

10:20.485 --> 10:22.749
First my girlfriend, now my team?

10:23.755 --> 10:25.620
Dude, this is an opportunity.

10:25.790 --> 10:28.691
Football's a contact sport.
Sometimes people get hurt.

10:29.794 --> 10:31.659
Whoo! Ha, ha.

10:31.830 --> 10:33.263
Seriously, where is Caroline?

10:33.898 --> 10:36.128
I don't know. It's not like her.

10:36.968 --> 10:37.992
I'll try her again.

10:43.742 --> 10:46.905
- Uh...
- Oh, my God.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.148
Must be the mystery guy
from the Grill.

10:51.316 --> 10:54.683
That's not a mystery guy.
That's Damon Salvatore.

10:54.886 --> 10:56.820
Salvatore? As in Stefan?

11:01.159 --> 11:04.026
I got the other brother.
Hope you don't mind.

11:04.229 --> 11:06.993
Sorry I'm late, girls. I, uh, was busy.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.794
Let's start with the double-pike
herkie hurdler. What do you say?

11:19.878 --> 11:22.904
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

11:23.114 --> 11:26.311
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

11:26.518 --> 11:28.213
One, two, three, four...

11:28.420 --> 11:29.887
Six, seven, eight.

11:30.088 --> 11:33.421
Elena, sweetie, why don't you
just observe today? Okay?

11:34.693 --> 11:35.785
Keep going. Okay.

11:35.960 --> 11:40.124
Let's do it again from the top.
And five, six, seven, eight.

11:40.365 --> 11:44.324
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.232
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

11:47.439 --> 11:51.034
Blue 80. Blue 80.

11:51.576 --> 11:53.441
Set, hut! Go!

11:57.982 --> 11:59.381
Come on, Tyler, cover him.

11:59.584 --> 12:01.415
- Lost the cut, man.
- Go get it, Stefan.

12:01.586 --> 12:03.486
That's the way to do it.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.713
Again!

12:07.592 --> 12:08.616
Let's line up!

12:21.506 --> 12:23.667
- Way to go, Salvatore!
- Good.

12:32.183 --> 12:34.947
- Nice catch, Salvatore.
- Come on, man.

12:38.156 --> 12:39.748
All right!

12:39.958 --> 12:41.892
- Don't let it slide!
- Yeah, baby.

12:42.093 --> 12:44.061
All right. That's it. Run that, baby.

12:44.229 --> 12:46.390
Way to go, Salvatore.

12:46.598 --> 12:50.159
- Good, baby.
- All right, let's go.

13:00.912 --> 13:03.380
Hate to say it, but he's got skills.

13:03.548 --> 13:06.483
- I think he needs a buddy pass.
- Really?

13:06.651 --> 13:10.417
You don't walk on the field and act
like you own the place after five minutes.

13:10.622 --> 13:14.285
- Hang one up, I'll take care of the rest.
- Let's do it again.

13:14.459 --> 13:16.654
All right, let's double up!

13:16.828 --> 13:18.557
Set, hut.

13:24.202 --> 13:25.794
There it is.

13:27.205 --> 13:30.732
Whoo! Welcome to the team, buddy.

13:31.342 --> 13:33.333
- Let's go.
- There you go.

13:33.545 --> 13:34.807
You gonna live, Salvatore?

13:35.013 --> 13:36.037
Nice one.

13:36.214 --> 13:38.182
- Yeah.
- Walk it off, son.

13:40.084 --> 13:42.143
Hey. That was my bad.

13:43.188 --> 13:46.180
- It's all right.
- Yeah.

13:46.724 --> 13:48.248
All right.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.024
I want you to come across.

14:04.475 --> 14:05.499
How were tryouts?

14:06.044 --> 14:07.409
Did you make the team?

14:08.913 --> 14:13.907
Very Emerson, the way you reveal
your soul with so many...

14:14.118 --> 14:15.278
Adjectives.

14:17.121 --> 14:18.281
What are you doing here?

14:21.860 --> 14:23.691
I've come to apologize.

14:23.862 --> 14:28.390
I've been doing some thinking,
some soul searching...

14:29.400 --> 14:33.598
...and I want us to start over.
We need to put the past behind us.

14:34.305 --> 14:36.136
You're my little brother...

14:36.307 --> 14:40.437
...and if you wanna live a normal,
happy, human life...

14:41.012 --> 14:42.604
...then I want that for you.

14:42.814 --> 14:44.714
Maybe I can do it too.

14:44.916 --> 14:50.513
If I can learn
to be a non-living living person...

14:51.656 --> 14:53.749
...maybe there's hope for both of us.

15:03.735 --> 15:06.568
You know, it doesn't have
to be this way, Damon.

15:06.771 --> 15:08.466
Of course it doesn't.

15:09.574 --> 15:12.634
I saw Elena today, BTW.
That means "by the way."

15:12.844 --> 15:14.573
She was at cheerleading practice.

15:14.779 --> 15:19.739
She looked so perky
in her little short shorts.

15:19.918 --> 15:21.317
Just...

15:22.186 --> 15:25.280
Simmer down,
I didn't even go near her.

15:25.456 --> 15:26.980
I've got my own cheerleader now.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.955
Ooh. That reminds me. I gotta run.

15:29.127 --> 15:30.651
I have a date.

15:30.828 --> 15:33.319
Sweaty palms. Wish me luck.

15:38.937 --> 15:41.201
You explain it.
Last night, I'm watching 9-0.

15:41.372 --> 15:45.206
Commercial break comes on and I'm like,
"I bet it's that phone commercial."

15:45.443 --> 15:49.311
It's the guy and the girl with the bench,
he flies to Paris and he flies back.

15:49.514 --> 15:51.379
- They take a picture.
- Oh, come on.

15:51.616 --> 15:55.609
- That commercial's on a constant loop.
- Fine. Well, how about this?

15:55.787 --> 15:58.483
Today, I'm obsessed with numbers.

15:58.656 --> 16:03.457
Three numbers. I keep seeing eight,
14, and 22. How weird is that?

16:05.330 --> 16:06.957
Maybe we should play the lottery.

16:09.434 --> 16:12.403
- Have you talked to your grams?
- She's just gonna say I'm a witch.

16:12.637 --> 16:15.629
- I don't wanna be a witch. Do you?
- I don't want to be a witch.

16:15.807 --> 16:18.799
And putting it in a nice bowl
isn't fooling anybody.

16:19.010 --> 16:21.877
Okay, serving spoons.
Where are the serving spoons?

16:22.046 --> 16:23.809
Middle drawer on your left.

16:34.025 --> 16:36.493
Okay, you've been in this kitchen
a thousand times.

16:36.694 --> 16:37.683
Yeah, that's it.

16:39.330 --> 16:40.763
Okay, he's here.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.560
Don't be nervous.
Just be your normal loving self.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.901
Birthday candles.

17:08.559 --> 17:10.356
Did Tanner give you
a hard time today?

17:11.295 --> 17:14.662
Well, he let me on the team,
so I must have done something right.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.192
Bonnie,
you should have seen Stefan today.

17:18.368 --> 17:21.395
- Tyler threw a ball right at him, and...
- Yeah, I heard.

17:27.211 --> 17:29.475
Why don't you tell Stefan
about your family?

17:31.315 --> 17:33.875
Um, divorced.
No mom, live with my dad.

17:34.919 --> 17:37.615
- Mm.
- No, about the witches.

17:38.089 --> 17:40.057
Bonnie's family
has a lineage of witches.

17:40.224 --> 17:42.556
- It's really cool.
- Cool isn't the word I'd use.

17:44.395 --> 17:45.726
It's certainly interesting.

17:45.930 --> 17:50.958
I'm not too versed, but I do know
that there's a history of Celtic Druids...

17:51.135 --> 17:52.830
...that migrated here in the 1800s.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.631
- My family came by way of Salem.
- Really?

17:57.208 --> 17:59.574
- Salem witches?
- Yeah.

18:00.244 --> 18:03.907
- I'd say that's pretty cool.
- Really? Why?

18:04.115 --> 18:06.845
Salem witches are heroic examples...

18:07.085 --> 18:11.112
...of individualism and nonconformity.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.516
Yeah, they are.

18:19.630 --> 18:21.655
I wonder who that could be.

18:24.602 --> 18:25.762
Surprise.

18:25.970 --> 18:28.336
Bonnie said you were doing dinner,
so we brought dessert.

18:28.673 --> 18:31.164
- Oh.
- Hope you don't mind.

18:34.278 --> 18:37.475
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for Elena to invite me in.

18:37.648 --> 18:39.172
- Oh, yeah, you can...
- No, no, no.

18:39.383 --> 18:41.044
He can't, um...

18:41.953 --> 18:42.977
He can't stay.

18:45.056 --> 18:46.182
Can you, Damon?

18:48.059 --> 18:49.822
Get in here.

18:50.695 --> 18:52.663
We're just finishing up.

18:52.864 --> 18:54.388
It's fine. Just come on in.

19:04.542 --> 19:07.204
You have a beautiful home, Elena.

19:07.378 --> 19:09.005
Thank you.

19:14.819 --> 19:17.344
I cannot believe that Mr. Tanner
let you on the team.

19:17.555 --> 19:21.548
Tyler must be seething.
But good for you. Go for it.

19:21.726 --> 19:24.092
That's what I always tell him.
You have to engage.

19:24.328 --> 19:27.320
You can't sit and wait for life to come.
You have to go get it.

19:27.532 --> 19:31.161
Yeah, Elena wasn't so lucky today.
It's because you missed summer camp.

19:31.335 --> 19:35.101
- I don't know how you're gonna learn.
- I'll work with her, she'll get it.

19:35.339 --> 19:37.432
I guess we can put her in the back.

19:37.608 --> 19:41.339
You know, you don't seem
like the cheerleader type, Elena.

19:42.113 --> 19:43.580
It's because her parents died.

19:43.748 --> 19:46.615
Yeah, I mean, she's just totally
going through a blah phase.

19:46.817 --> 19:50.378
She used to be way more fun.

19:50.555 --> 19:54.218
And I say that
with complete sensitivity.

19:55.393 --> 19:58.556
I'm sorry, Elena. I know what it's like
to lose both your parents.

19:58.763 --> 20:01.527
In fact, Stefan and I
have watched every single person...

20:01.732 --> 20:03.256
...we've ever cared about die.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.526
We don't need
to get into that right now.

20:05.736 --> 20:07.761
Oh, you're right, Stef. I'm sorry.

20:07.972 --> 20:11.135
The last thing I wanted to do
was bring her up. Ha.

20:15.546 --> 20:17.411
Mmm.

20:17.582 --> 20:20.142
Don't do that. Not while I'm working.

20:23.754 --> 20:25.847
See you later.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.826
She's my sister and I love her...

20:37.001 --> 20:40.767
...but sometimes
she can really make you work for it.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.804
I find it pretty easy.

20:52.116 --> 20:55.449
All right, I get it. Hit me to impress her.
That's real nice.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.611
I don't need to impress her.

20:58.623 --> 21:00.181
I already won.

21:01.192 --> 21:02.318
Oh, now you're dead.

21:02.493 --> 21:05.326
Am I? It seems I'm standing here
waiting for you to man up.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.092
Ty, don't.

21:07.298 --> 21:10.631
- The next time I see you, Gilbert...
- No, next time I see you.

21:17.174 --> 21:19.108
What are you doing, Vick?

21:21.646 --> 21:23.045
One more.

21:23.214 --> 21:24.238
Mm. Thank you.

21:28.653 --> 21:29.915
Nice save.

21:31.022 --> 21:32.387
I like you.

21:32.556 --> 21:35.218
You know how to laugh.
And you make Stefan smile...

21:35.426 --> 21:39.453
...which is something I haven't seen
in a very long time.

21:41.432 --> 21:44.026
Earlier, did you mean Katherine?

21:44.302 --> 21:46.099
Mm-hm.

21:46.304 --> 21:47.931
How did she die?

21:49.507 --> 21:51.805
In a fire. Tragic fire.

21:52.510 --> 21:53.943
Recently?

21:54.145 --> 21:55.737
It seems like it was yesterday.

21:59.050 --> 22:00.312
What was she like?

22:03.554 --> 22:06.250
She was beautiful.
A lot like you in that department.

22:06.991 --> 22:10.984
She was also very complicated
and selfish, and at times not very kind...

22:11.162 --> 22:12.652
...but very sexy and seductive.

22:13.998 --> 22:17.331
So which one of you dated her first?

22:20.571 --> 22:26.532
Nicely deduced. Ask Stefan.
I'm sure his answer differs from mine.

22:36.387 --> 22:38.787
I'd quit cheerleading if I were you.

22:39.890 --> 22:42.222
- Why do you say that?
- Oh, I saw you at practice.

22:42.393 --> 22:43.485
You looked miserable.

22:43.694 --> 22:46.527
- You saw that?
- Am I wrong?

22:46.764 --> 22:49.255
I used to love it. It was fun.

22:49.500 --> 22:53.095
Things are different this year.
Everything that mattered doesn't anymore.

22:53.270 --> 22:56.762
So don't let it. Quit, move on.
Problem solved, ta-da.

22:58.642 --> 23:00.200
Some things could matter again.

23:00.378 --> 23:01.572
Maybe.

23:01.779 --> 23:05.909
But it seems a little unrealistic to me.

23:11.522 --> 23:13.080
I'm sorry.

23:15.159 --> 23:16.524
About Katherine.

23:18.929 --> 23:20.556
You lost her too.

23:24.468 --> 23:27.130
Hey. Need some help?

23:29.240 --> 23:30.264
Sure, why not?

23:30.474 --> 23:33.910
Matt tries,
but he's just having a really hard time.

23:34.111 --> 23:37.103
You have to understand
that they were each other's first.

23:37.281 --> 23:40.739
You know, like, from the sandbox.

23:43.854 --> 23:45.446
- That's a really nice scarf.
- Mm.

23:46.290 --> 23:48.315
- Thank you, it's new.
- Can I see it?

23:49.293 --> 23:51.853
I mean, would you mind taking it off?

23:52.096 --> 23:53.154
Oh, I can't.

23:53.364 --> 23:55.992
Why not? You okay?

23:57.802 --> 23:59.269
Um...

23:59.437 --> 24:02.270
All I know is that I can't take it off.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.170
What are you two kids talking about?

24:05.676 --> 24:08.702
- I was just commenting on her scarf.
- Mm.

24:08.879 --> 24:11.871
Hey, you know, uh, Elena and Bonnie
are finishing up the dishes.

24:12.082 --> 24:17.145
- Why don't you go see if you can help?
- Does it look like I do dishes? Ha, ha.

24:17.321 --> 24:18.618
For me?

24:19.190 --> 24:20.953
Mmm, I don't think so.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.294
Go see if Elena needs help in the kitchen.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.226
You know what?
I'm gonna go see if Elena...

24:32.403 --> 24:34.735
...needs some help in the kitchen.
- Great.

24:44.615 --> 24:47.482
They are people, Damon.
She's not a puppet.

24:47.651 --> 24:51.178
She doesn't exist for your amusement
for you to feed on whenever you want.

24:51.355 --> 24:53.414
Sure she does. They all do.

24:53.624 --> 24:56.684
They're whatever I want them to be.
They're mine for the taking.

24:56.861 --> 24:57.885
You've had your fun.

24:58.128 --> 25:01.154
You used Caroline,
you got to me and Elena, good for you.

25:01.332 --> 25:02.697
Now it's time for you to go.

25:03.501 --> 25:05.332
That's not a problem.

25:05.536 --> 25:09.131
Because I've been invited in.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.070
I'll come back tomorrow night
and the following night...

25:12.243 --> 25:17.840
...and I'll do with your little cheerleader
whatever I want to do.

25:18.048 --> 25:22.178
Because that is what is normal to me.

25:27.892 --> 25:32.090
- Tonight wasn't so bad. I had fun.
- Mmm. That makes one of us.

25:33.464 --> 25:36.922
Come on. Your brother isn't as bad
as you make him out to be.

27:06.552 --> 27:10.682
There must be a shred
of humanity left inside my brother.

27:10.857 --> 27:12.722
Somewhere.

27:12.926 --> 27:14.689
I keep hoping.

27:14.861 --> 27:17.352
But how do I make him see it?

27:17.931 --> 27:20.229
And how do I protect her?

27:45.425 --> 27:48.292
Just a couple of hours
until kickoff, Timberwolves fans.

27:48.461 --> 27:50.053
Don't forget...

27:54.801 --> 27:58.760
Ooh. Look at you.
You look hot in your jersey.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.066
- What happened? No more cheerleader?
- I quit. I'm a quitter.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.301
No. Hey, you're not a quitter.
You suffered a great loss.

28:05.478 --> 28:09.505
You're not the same person.
You should be looking ahead.

28:09.749 --> 28:12.877
You should be starting over. Okay?

28:15.021 --> 28:19.754
I hope you don't think
this is too soon or too weird...

28:19.959 --> 28:22.655
...but I wanted you to have this.

28:29.535 --> 28:31.435
Oh, my God, it's beautiful.

28:31.637 --> 28:33.628
It's something that I've had forever...

28:33.806 --> 28:37.298
...and I've never wanted
to give it to anyone until now.

28:37.477 --> 28:43.712
I'd very much like it
if you'd wear it for me, for good luck.

28:45.451 --> 28:48.784
- Is that rose that I smell?
- No, it's a... It's an herb.

28:50.056 --> 28:53.150
- It's nice, huh?
- I love it.

28:55.995 --> 29:03.128
And I wanted to thank you
for pushing me to try out for the team.

29:04.137 --> 29:06.537
- It feels really good.
- We're a pair.

29:06.706 --> 29:08.173
I quit, you start.

29:08.374 --> 29:11.366
We're a, uh... We're a work in progress.

29:12.812 --> 29:14.439
We'll figure it out.

29:27.960 --> 29:29.587
And you're not in uniform because?

29:49.482 --> 29:51.712
Quiet down for a minute.

29:52.585 --> 29:53.745
Okay?

29:57.723 --> 29:59.953
Wait, wait, wait.

30:00.126 --> 30:02.117
Wait, wait, wait.

30:02.361 --> 30:03.521
Wait.

30:03.696 --> 30:07.564
Let's be honest here. In the past,
we used to let other teams...

30:07.767 --> 30:10.793
...come into our town
and roll right over us.

30:12.705 --> 30:15.435
But that is about to change.

30:18.277 --> 30:21.906
We've got some great new talent
tonight starting on offense...

30:22.115 --> 30:25.107
...and I'm gonna tell you right now,
it has been a long time...

30:25.284 --> 30:30.017
...since I have seen a kid like this
with hands like these.

30:32.625 --> 30:35.924
Let's give it up for Stefan Salvatore.

30:36.462 --> 30:39.056
This blows. He can't start the guy.
He just got here.

30:39.232 --> 30:43.566
That have been waiting
for us to put a check in the win column...

30:43.736 --> 30:48.332
...I have only one thing to say to you,
We're Timberwolves, we're hungry.

30:51.644 --> 30:53.305
Hey, babe. What's wrong?

30:53.546 --> 30:55.741
- Nothing.
- And the Central High Lions...

30:55.915 --> 30:59.282
...are what's for dinner.
- Is that Jeremy?

30:59.452 --> 31:01.579
Oh, no, Ty. No. Leave him alone.

31:01.754 --> 31:04.052
What do you care? Don't look so down.

31:05.458 --> 31:06.982
You can have her when I'm done.

31:11.130 --> 31:12.927
- Unh!
- Tyler, stop it.

31:14.167 --> 31:15.429
Tyler!

31:18.070 --> 31:19.799
Stop, you're hurting him.

31:20.006 --> 31:22.270
Tyler. Tyler, stop.

31:25.278 --> 31:26.870
Tyler. Stop it!

31:27.880 --> 31:30.678
Hey, he's down. Enough.

31:38.124 --> 31:39.113
Jeremy, no.

31:40.459 --> 31:41.983
- Tyler, knock it off.
- Get off me.

31:42.195 --> 31:45.631
- Stop.
- What the hell, Jeremy?

31:46.632 --> 31:48.862
- Put your head up, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.

31:49.101 --> 31:52.400
- Yeah, you smell fine.
- Just stop, okay?

31:53.306 --> 31:55.297
Come on, man. Come on.

31:55.508 --> 31:56.998
Oh, my God, your hand.

31:57.210 --> 31:58.507
No, no, no, it's fine.

31:58.711 --> 32:00.838
Is it deep? How bad is it?

32:01.013 --> 32:02.605
Come on.

32:06.719 --> 32:09.017
- But I saw it, it was...
- He missed.

32:09.222 --> 32:10.348
It's not my blood.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.248
See? I'm fine.

32:12.425 --> 32:13.722
No, no, no, I saw it.

32:13.893 --> 32:15.758
- The glass cut your hand...
- It's okay.

32:15.995 --> 32:17.690
I'm okay.

32:18.931 --> 32:23.391
It's almost kickoff time, all right?
So I'll see you after the game.

32:32.712 --> 32:34.111
Hey, Tiki, it's all wobbly.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.408
Can you stand straight, please?
Could someone please help Tiki?

32:37.583 --> 32:39.107
- Any...? No?
- Hey, where you been?

32:39.285 --> 32:43.187
Can I ask you a question? And you give
me a really serious no-joke response?

32:43.389 --> 32:46.119
- Of course. What is it?
- The bad mojo.

32:46.292 --> 32:48.760
When you touched Stefan
and you had that reaction...

32:48.928 --> 32:51.761
Forget I said that.
Your dinner-party plot won me over.

32:51.964 --> 32:53.864
No, Bonnie, seriously. What was it?

32:54.033 --> 32:55.967
Did you see something, or?

32:58.304 --> 32:59.794
It wasn't clear like a picture.

33:00.039 --> 33:03.770
Like today, I keep seeing
those same numbers I told you about...

33:03.943 --> 33:05.808
...eight, 14, 22.

33:06.045 --> 33:08.809
- Yeah?
- When I touched Stefan, it was a feeling.

33:09.048 --> 33:13.382
And it vibrated through me,
and it was cold, and...

33:14.186 --> 33:15.312
And what?

33:16.489 --> 33:17.581
It was death.

33:18.491 --> 33:20.959
It's what I imagine death to be like.

33:34.940 --> 33:36.965
You scared me.
What are you doing here?

33:37.209 --> 33:39.268
I'm hiding from Caroline.

33:39.445 --> 33:42.073
-  And why is that?
-  I needed a break.

33:42.248 --> 33:44.273
She talks more than I can listen.

33:44.950 --> 33:46.440
That could be a sign.

33:46.986 --> 33:50.353
- Well, she's awfully young.
- Not much younger than you are.

33:50.589 --> 33:52.250
Yeah.

33:52.792 --> 33:55.317
I don't see it going anywhere
in the bigger picture.

33:55.494 --> 33:56.927
I think she'd drive me crazy.

33:57.096 --> 34:00.827
Caroline does have annoying traits but
we've been friends since first grade...

34:01.000 --> 34:02.661
...and that means something to me.

34:03.302 --> 34:06.362
Duly noted.
I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable.

34:06.539 --> 34:07.870
That's not my intention.

34:09.141 --> 34:13.134
Yes, it is. Otherwise,
you wouldn't put an alternate meaning...

34:13.312 --> 34:15.246
...behind everything you say.

34:18.117 --> 34:19.846
You're right.

34:20.686 --> 34:22.677
I do have other intentions,
but so do you.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.949
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

34:25.157 --> 34:27.125
I see them.

34:28.527 --> 34:29.551
You want me.

34:29.762 --> 34:31.661
- Excuse me?
- I get to you.

34:31.831 --> 34:34.322
You find yourself drawn to me.
You think about me...

34:34.500 --> 34:37.128
...when you don't wanna.
I bet you've dreamed about me.

34:39.505 --> 34:43.498
And right now, you wanna kiss me.

34:51.283 --> 34:54.252
What the hell? I don't know what game
you're trying to play...

34:54.420 --> 34:56.853
...with Stefan,
but I don't wanna be part of it.

34:57.056 --> 34:59.024
I don't know
what happened in the past...

34:59.191 --> 35:02.888
...but let's get one thing straight,
I am not Katherine.

35:11.036 --> 35:12.298
You gonna be able to play?

35:13.305 --> 35:15.432
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

35:15.875 --> 35:17.206
Uh, what you did back there.

35:19.111 --> 35:20.169
You had Jeremy's back.

35:21.013 --> 35:22.674
He's a messed-up kid.

35:22.848 --> 35:25.874
- Somebody's gotta look out for him.
- I know.

35:26.318 --> 35:28.786
This week at practice I was a dick.

35:28.954 --> 35:32.390
- Had your reasons.
- No excuse.

35:37.096 --> 35:39.724
Good luck tonight.
We're lucky to have you.

35:47.940 --> 35:51.967
Isn't that nice?
Stefan joins a team, makes a friend.

35:53.212 --> 35:55.976
It's all so, "Rah, rah, go team, yeah."

35:56.148 --> 35:58.207
Not tonight. I'm done with you.

36:00.986 --> 36:02.146
Nice trick with Elena.

36:02.388 --> 36:07.291
Let me guess. Vervain in the necklace.
I admit, I was a bit surprised.

36:07.493 --> 36:10.360
It's been a while
since anyone could resist my compulsion.

36:11.897 --> 36:12.955
Where'd you get it?

36:13.165 --> 36:15.565
- Does it matter?
- Guess I could just seduce her...

36:15.734 --> 36:19.135
...the old-fashioned way.
Or I could just eat her.

36:23.242 --> 36:29.010
- No. You're not gonna hurt her, Damon.
- No?

36:29.181 --> 36:33.584
Because deep down inside,
there is a part of you that feels for her.

36:34.453 --> 36:38.787
I was worried that you had
no humanity left inside of you...

36:38.958 --> 36:41.426
...that you may have
actually become the monster...

36:41.594 --> 36:43.084
...that you pretend to be.

36:43.295 --> 36:45.092
- Who's pretending?
- Then kill me.

36:45.798 --> 36:49.632
- Well, I'm tempted.
- No, you're not.

36:49.835 --> 36:52.668
You've had lifetimes to do it,
and yet, here I am.

36:52.838 --> 36:56.035
I'm still alive. And there you are.

36:56.208 --> 37:01.612
You're still haunting me.
After 145 years.

37:01.814 --> 37:03.805
Katherine is dead.

37:05.484 --> 37:11.719
And you hate me because you loved her,
and you torture me because you still do.

37:12.358 --> 37:17.921
And that, my brother,
that is your humanity.

37:19.732 --> 37:20.994
Salvatore.

37:23.168 --> 37:25.068
What the hell?
We've got a game to play.

37:26.372 --> 37:28.465
If that's my humanity...

37:29.508 --> 37:30.532
...then what's this?

37:33.812 --> 37:35.439
No!

37:40.586 --> 37:44.522
Anyone, any time, any place.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.894
Tanner's MIA.
I think he had a bit too much beer...

37:52.064 --> 37:55.397
- Don't talk to me. I'm pissed at you.
- What's your problem?

37:55.601 --> 37:57.899
You're my problem, all right?
You're a bully.

37:58.070 --> 38:00.436
A freaking 12-year-old bully, man.
I'm sick of it.

38:00.606 --> 38:02.096
What was that about tonight?

38:02.341 --> 38:04.275
What's beating up the new guy
gonna prove?

38:05.010 --> 38:08.207
Or screwing with my sister
or pummeling my girlfriend's brother.

38:08.414 --> 38:10.507
Girlfriend?
I don't know how to tell you...

38:10.683 --> 38:13.618
...but she dumped your ass.
Are you for real?

38:13.852 --> 38:19.017
- You wanna hit me? I'm on your team.
- This was over the line. Even for you.

38:43.382 --> 38:44.406
Somebody help!

39:56.188 --> 39:58.281
It wasn't just for the drugs.

40:12.471 --> 40:14.530
What kind of animal
could be doing all this?

40:14.707 --> 40:16.504
Why would it
come out of the woods...

40:16.675 --> 40:18.734
...and attack someone
in the middle of town?

40:18.911 --> 40:21.539
I don't know. I don't know.

40:23.749 --> 40:26.309
I was so sure that you cut your hand.

40:26.518 --> 40:28.816
- I saw it.
- I'm fine.

40:28.987 --> 40:31.979
I'm fine, okay? We're fine.

40:32.157 --> 40:33.249
That's what matters.

40:50.576 --> 40:52.567
I thought there was hope.

40:53.145 --> 40:55.511
That somewhere deep inside...

40:55.681 --> 41:00.846
...something in Damon
was still human, normal.

41:07.459 --> 41:09.290
But I was wrong.

41:09.461 --> 41:12.589
There's nothing human left in Damon.

41:12.765 --> 41:16.895
No good, no kindness, no love.

41:18.070 --> 41:23.269
Only a monster who must be stopped.
