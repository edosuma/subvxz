WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.003
NARRATOR: All over the world,
governments are now

00:04.162 --> 00:08.007
openly investigating
unidentified flying objects.

00:08.091 --> 00:10.342
DAVID CHILDRESS:
We've seen a dramatic increase

00:10.427 --> 00:12.836
in UFO reports in a number

00:12.929 --> 00:14.930
of countries around the world.

00:15.089 --> 00:16.765
NARRATOR:
From democracies

00:16.924 --> 00:18.175
to dictatorships,

00:18.268 --> 00:20.093
world leaders
have begun releasing

00:20.178 --> 00:24.023
secret and still
unexplained video evidence.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.860
JEREMY CORBELL: Even
in a closed country like China,

00:28.019 --> 00:30.446
what we're seeing
is acknowledgment

00:30.530 --> 00:32.022
of the UFO phenomenon.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.106
NARRATOR:
But why are governments

00:33.199 --> 00:35.859
that once denied UFOs

00:35.943 --> 00:38.537
suddenly launching
serious inquiries?

00:38.696 --> 00:40.947
And if the new spirit
of openness spreads,

00:41.041 --> 00:43.459
where might that lead?

00:43.618 --> 00:47.287
NICK POPE: After nearly 80
years of denying and debunking,

00:47.380 --> 00:50.632
you have international
cooperation and liaison.

00:50.792 --> 00:52.301
This is governments

00:52.385 --> 00:54.887
acknowledging
that there's a potential threat

00:54.971 --> 00:58.057
and that something
needs to be done.

01:01.302 --> 01:03.479
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:03.563 --> 01:05.722
in the universe.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.026
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:10.228 --> 01:12.395
It demands
we question everything

01:12.480 --> 01:14.656
we have ever been taught.

01:14.741 --> 01:18.911
The evidence is all around us.

01:19.070 --> 01:22.405
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:22.490 --> 01:25.075
We are not alone.

01:25.159 --> 01:28.837
We have never been alone.

01:43.511 --> 01:45.187
The United States government

01:45.271 --> 01:49.099
breaks a 70-year precedent
of denying UFOs

01:49.183 --> 01:51.610
and releases
a groundbreaking report

01:51.694 --> 01:55.280
on unidentified
aerial phenomena.

01:55.439 --> 01:58.200
The nine-page
unclassified document

01:58.359 --> 02:02.779
identifies 144 UAP incidents

02:02.864 --> 02:05.207
and concludes
that only one of them

02:05.366 --> 02:07.459
can be explained.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.878
JOHN PODESTA:
For the first time,

02:10.037 --> 02:11.454
you actually had
the U.S. government

02:11.548 --> 02:15.217
putting out physical evidence

02:15.376 --> 02:18.128
that any person
in the United States

02:18.221 --> 02:20.213
or around the globe
could click on

02:20.306 --> 02:23.475
and see and say,
"Okay, what's that about?"

02:23.634 --> 02:26.812
And I think you're left
with the impression

02:26.971 --> 02:29.231
that this is
something extremely unusual,

02:29.315 --> 02:32.818
highly unlikely
that it's sourced

02:32.902 --> 02:35.979
to a foreign government
or to the U.S. government.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.574
And, therefore,
you're left with what?

02:39.734 --> 02:40.984
GEORGE KNAPP:
I hope

02:41.068 --> 02:43.820
that because of
the recent openness

02:43.905 --> 02:45.405
of the U.S. government,

02:45.489 --> 02:47.916
some of our allies
will take a cue from that.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.835
These things
are not an American phenomena.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.503
They are seen
all over the world.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.663
They've been seen
on every continent,

02:53.756 --> 02:56.249
in every culture
throughout human history.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.169
The fact is that Russia,
like the U.S., like China,

02:59.262 --> 03:00.762
like most other
world governments,

03:00.847 --> 03:03.265
has been interested
in this topic forever.

03:04.842 --> 03:06.185
CHILDRESS:
In the last few years,

03:06.344 --> 03:09.846
we've seen a dramatic increase
in UFO reports

03:09.939 --> 03:12.774
in a number of countries
around the world.

03:12.934 --> 03:15.352
In South America.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.521
Also in Iran and the Philippines

03:18.606 --> 03:21.366
and Japan and even China.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.028
When I look at the best cases

03:25.121 --> 03:26.363
of military pilots,
commercial pilots

03:26.456 --> 03:28.949
all over the world
caught on radar,

03:29.033 --> 03:33.370
ground radar,
ground and airborne radar,

03:33.454 --> 03:35.464
multiple aircraft
ground and airborne radar,

03:35.623 --> 03:38.050
it's clearly
a worldwide phenomenon.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.709
NARRATOR:
While the United States

03:39.802 --> 03:41.887
officially denied
investigating UAPs

03:42.046 --> 03:44.890
until 2017,

03:44.974 --> 03:47.309
some nations
had always been ahead

03:47.393 --> 03:49.186
in their approach
to the subject.

03:50.813 --> 03:53.223
Leading the world
in UAP research

03:53.307 --> 03:55.901
is the South American country
of Chile.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.071
In 1997,

03:59.230 --> 04:01.490
the Chilean government
officially instructed

04:01.574 --> 04:04.734
air traffic control
and military personnel

04:04.827 --> 04:06.995
to create
the Committee for the Study

04:07.080 --> 04:09.656
of Anomalous Aerial Phenomena.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.418
The committee studies
all reports of UAP activity

04:13.577 --> 04:17.339
by commercial,
military and civilian pilots.

04:17.498 --> 04:19.249
One of the most well-publicized

04:19.342 --> 04:23.178
was a shocking incident
that occurred in 2014

04:23.337 --> 04:25.422
when Chilean naval officers

04:25.515 --> 04:28.508
flying along the coast
of Santiago

04:28.601 --> 04:30.760
captured video of a UAP.

04:30.853 --> 04:32.354
ALEJANDRO ROJAS:
There was an incident

04:32.513 --> 04:35.691
in 2014
where a military helicopter

04:35.775 --> 04:38.018
got video of a strange object.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.111
It kind of looked like

04:39.270 --> 04:40.779
a rocket with some sort of plume
behind it.

04:42.606 --> 04:45.608
And they said they were
at about 4,500 feet.

04:45.693 --> 04:47.527
RICHARD DOLAN:
They have nine minutes

04:47.620 --> 04:51.123
of fairly clear video
that exists on this.

04:51.282 --> 04:53.199
The Chilean military
studied it for two years,

04:53.293 --> 04:55.627
and they were not able
to identify this at all.

04:56.954 --> 04:58.288
HESELTINE:
Chile,

04:58.381 --> 05:00.540
like many other
South American countries,

05:00.624 --> 05:02.959
seem to be far more open
to the idea

05:03.044 --> 05:06.638
that there are objects
coming into our airspace.

05:09.133 --> 05:10.309
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
I think one of the reasons

05:10.468 --> 05:14.313
why South American countries
are more open-minded

05:14.472 --> 05:17.733
about the UFO and
the extraterrestrial question

05:17.817 --> 05:21.069
is because it is part
of their cultural heritage.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.406
In fact, Peru

05:24.565 --> 05:26.908
and Bolivia,
they're treasure troves

05:26.993 --> 05:29.244
for the ancient
astronaut theory.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.989
The whole pre-Inca culture
and even the Inca culture spoke

05:33.074 --> 05:37.002
of these beings of light
that descended from the sky.

05:38.996 --> 05:42.591
And so, these countries
essentially grew up

05:42.750 --> 05:49.589
with this intrinsic knowledge
of someone up in the sky.

05:49.673 --> 05:53.518
Brazil has had a history of
really dramatic UFO encounters.

05:53.677 --> 05:57.272
Chile, I think Uruguay,
maybe, as well.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.025
But the whole world didn't
pay much attention to it.

06:00.184 --> 06:02.769
NARRATOR:
In addition to South America,

06:02.853 --> 06:04.437
now other parts of the world

06:04.530 --> 06:08.942
are also starting to disclose
information about UFOs.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.112
Governments are openly
investigating encounters

06:12.205 --> 06:16.282
reported by both civilians
and military personnel.

06:16.367 --> 06:20.045
But many researchers believe
the most noteworthy country

06:20.204 --> 06:22.455
to join this international
effort is also

06:22.540 --> 06:27.127
one of the most skeptical:
Japan.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.807
In 2018, the Japanese government
released an official statement

06:31.891 --> 06:36.136
denying the existence of UFOs.

06:36.229 --> 06:39.815
For the longest time in Japan,
those in charge,

06:39.899 --> 06:42.734
those at the top
of the defense departments

06:42.893 --> 06:47.480
have denied UFOs,
showed a disinterest in UFOs,

06:47.573 --> 06:51.660
basically a complete dismissal
of the UFO topic completely.

06:51.819 --> 06:55.321
GREG SULLIVAN: The Japanese
government made a sudden press release

06:55.406 --> 06:58.575
that was said they would not
recognize any UFO encounters

06:58.659 --> 07:00.669
or extraterrestrial presence
on Earth

07:00.828 --> 07:03.663
or in the airspace of Japan.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.749
I thought this was very strange,
as we had already interviewed

07:06.843 --> 07:12.005
two pilots, uh, who had several
i-incidents and, uh, testimonies

07:12.098 --> 07:15.341
that they gave us regarding
various pilots' encounters

07:15.426 --> 07:18.094
in the air and from the ground
over the years

07:18.187 --> 07:20.021
when they were active
in the military.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.775
NARRATOR: Mamoru Sato,
a former wing commander

07:23.934 --> 07:25.861
in the Japanese
Self-Defense Force,

07:25.945 --> 07:29.522
said that he regularly heard
stories from other pilots

07:29.607 --> 07:32.284
as well as civilians
about UAP sightings.

07:35.112 --> 07:36.529
(speaking Japanese)

07:36.622 --> 07:37.706
TRANSLATOR:
Some people said,

07:37.865 --> 07:39.541
"There's something strange
up there."

07:39.700 --> 07:41.034
There were a lot
of opportunities

07:41.118 --> 07:42.702
to see inexplicable things,

07:42.786 --> 07:45.371
such as UFOs
that were monitoring the sky

07:45.465 --> 07:47.540
and training in the sky.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.793
And it was my subjective view
that we should make a report

07:50.887 --> 07:53.305
and organize these things
as correct data.

07:53.389 --> 07:56.049
But even when this happened,
it was only shared

07:56.142 --> 07:58.051
among colleagues
and not reported publicly.

07:58.135 --> 07:59.644
(speaking Japanese)

08:01.639 --> 08:03.973
NARRATOR: According
to Sato, numerous pilots

08:04.058 --> 08:06.818
have reported
highly unusual encounters

08:06.977 --> 08:10.739
with what they described
as cigar-shaped objects.

08:10.898 --> 08:12.315
During one such incident,

08:12.408 --> 08:14.743
a student
in his fighter pilot course

08:14.902 --> 08:17.237
even lost control of his craft.

08:17.321 --> 08:20.156
(speaking Japanese)

08:20.249 --> 08:23.752
SATO (translated): He said,
"The aircraft started going crazy."

08:23.836 --> 08:24.920
The alarm rang to indicate
that something was wrong

08:25.079 --> 08:26.496
with the machine.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.924
I saw a cigar-shaped object
flying

08:29.008 --> 08:32.677
about 1,500 meters high
from east to west.

08:32.836 --> 08:36.431
The anomaly continued
until it disappeared.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.434
NARRATOR: For years,
pilots in the Japanese military

08:39.519 --> 08:42.929
were instructed to remain silent
about such incidents.

08:43.022 --> 08:46.107
But in September 2020,

08:46.192 --> 08:49.611
Japan's decades-long policy
of secrecy and denial

08:49.695 --> 08:53.356
came to an end
when Defense Minister Taro Kono

08:53.440 --> 08:55.951
tasked the Japanese
Self-Defense Forces

08:56.035 --> 08:58.453
to make a visual recording
of any encounter

08:58.612 --> 09:00.780
with an unexplained craft.

09:00.864 --> 09:04.376
Many believe
this very public shift in policy

09:04.535 --> 09:07.045
was prompted by a meeting
held one month earlier

09:07.204 --> 09:11.124
between Minister Kono
and his U.S. counterpart

09:11.217 --> 09:14.052
Defense Secretary Mark Esper.

09:14.136 --> 09:17.806
The Japanese,
after this meeting,

09:17.965 --> 09:20.133
uh, gave a press conference.

09:20.217 --> 09:23.812
And they said one
of the topics that came up

09:23.896 --> 09:26.306
was unidentified
aerial phenomena.

09:26.399 --> 09:30.318
And we talked about
the need to cooperate on this.

09:31.645 --> 09:33.572
That's a major development,
I think,

09:33.656 --> 09:36.482
when you have close allies
like the U.S. and Japan

09:36.576 --> 09:40.078
openly speaking about the UFO
issue and agreeing to cooperate.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.072
We've come so far in such
a short amount of time.

09:43.157 --> 09:45.250
RYAN SPRAGUE:
The fact that Japan denied

09:45.409 --> 09:49.004
that there was UFO activity
happening in their country,

09:49.163 --> 09:50.913
and now they're establishing

09:51.007 --> 09:55.343
the Japanese
Space Operations Squadron

09:55.502 --> 09:59.005
says to me that there
clearly is something going on

09:59.098 --> 10:01.424
over the skies of Japan.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.344
NARRATOR: Ancient
astronaut theorists suggest

10:04.437 --> 10:06.095
governments throughout the world

10:06.180 --> 10:08.607
are finally beginning
to acknowledge

10:08.691 --> 10:10.191
that there may be objects
in our skies

10:10.351 --> 10:12.769
that are not of this Earth,

10:12.853 --> 10:15.271
and they say
that when it comes to promoting

10:15.356 --> 10:18.024
investigation and transparency,

10:18.117 --> 10:22.695
one of the biggest proponents is
also one of the most unlikely:

10:22.780 --> 10:26.541
the royal family of Britain.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.793
NARRATOR: At a meeting
of the House of Lords--

10:36.886 --> 10:38.711
The second chamber
of Parliament--

10:38.796 --> 10:42.131
Minister of Defence,
Baroness Annabel Goldie,

10:42.216 --> 10:44.717
is questioned about
the just-released report

10:44.802 --> 10:49.481
on unidentified aerial phenomena
issued by the United States,

10:49.565 --> 10:55.403
and is asked if the U.K. plans
on issuing a report of its own.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.897
HESELTINE: Baroness Goldie
answered in a way that said

10:57.990 --> 11:00.233
that there is no threat.

11:00.317 --> 11:02.318
She was very careful
how she phrased it.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.997
She said there has never
been a "proven" threat.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.658
Reading between the lines,

11:08.742 --> 11:11.577
that said to me
that unless these things

11:11.662 --> 11:13.663
are gonna start
shooting at our aeroplanes,

11:13.756 --> 11:15.748
they're not considered a threat.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.010
NARRATOR: But while the
British Parliament has no plans

11:19.169 --> 11:23.005
to release its own UAP report,
it was recently discovered

11:23.090 --> 11:25.925
that for more than 70 years,
UFO activity

11:26.018 --> 11:27.927
was closely monitored

11:28.020 --> 11:31.690
by some of the most prominent
members of the royal family.

11:33.192 --> 11:37.270
April 9, 2021.

11:37.354 --> 11:39.772
Prince Philip,
Duke of Edinburgh,

11:39.865 --> 11:42.942
passes away at the age of 99.

11:43.035 --> 11:47.872
As publications across the world
report on his incredible life,

11:47.957 --> 11:50.116
it comes to light
that the prince

11:50.209 --> 11:54.212
had a long-held fascination
with the UFO phenomenon.

11:54.296 --> 12:00.126
When Prince Philip died
in the spring of 2021,

12:00.219 --> 12:02.637
there was a bit of a surprise
to the British public,

12:02.722 --> 12:07.058
and that was that Prince Philip
had a huge collection

12:07.143 --> 12:12.305
of books on UFOs that went
right back to the mid-1940s.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.983
DOLAN: He had an associate
named Sir Peter Horsley

12:15.142 --> 12:17.226
who was a former RAF pilot.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.561
He was a good friend
of Prince Philip,

12:18.654 --> 12:20.480
and back in the mid-1950s,

12:20.573 --> 12:24.159
was charged by the prince
to do a lot of research

12:24.318 --> 12:27.245
into this whole
flying saucer situation.

12:27.404 --> 12:31.082
POPE:
The two of them over the years

12:31.241 --> 12:34.243
researched and investigated
this quietly,

12:34.336 --> 12:36.329
kept an eye
on all the developments,

12:36.413 --> 12:42.919
secretly subscribed to various
UFO magazines and newsletters,

12:43.012 --> 12:46.514
and even had witnesses
interviewed.

12:46.673 --> 12:50.176
But a lot of this, of course,
was highly sensitive.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.346
I mean, here you have
the queen's husband,

12:53.430 --> 12:55.264
Prince Philip,
Duke of Edinburgh,

12:55.349 --> 12:58.610
researching
and investigating UFOs.

12:58.694 --> 13:03.198
Had the news got out, it would
have caused a sensation.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.442
NARRATOR: While those
within the UFO community

13:06.527 --> 13:09.204
had long been aware of
Prince Philip's investigations

13:09.363 --> 13:11.372
into strange phenomena,

13:11.532 --> 13:14.709
most of the public only
learned of it with his passing.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.962
And it also came to light
that another member

13:18.121 --> 13:20.632
of the British royal family
was responsible

13:20.791 --> 13:24.710
for one of Great Britain's
earliest UFO reports.

13:24.795 --> 13:29.224
Hampshire, England, 1955.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.812
On the morning
of February 23rd, at 8:30 a.m.,

13:33.896 --> 13:36.973
bricklayer Frederick Briggs
is riding his bike

13:37.057 --> 13:39.892
when he encounters
a startling sight,

13:39.985 --> 13:45.240
an enormous object in the sky
above his employer's estate.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.650
POPE:
He said this thing was huge,

13:47.743 --> 13:52.238
it was hovering a short distance
above the ground,

13:52.331 --> 13:57.001
some sort of column descended
and a figure emerged,

13:57.160 --> 14:01.747
a humanoid figure wearing
some sort of dark uniform

14:01.841 --> 14:05.677
and-and perhaps wearing
a hat or a helmet.

14:05.836 --> 14:09.088
And at one point he talks
about a force

14:09.181 --> 14:12.925
knocking him off his bicycle
and holding him down.

14:13.010 --> 14:16.271
He talks about the UFO
as having windows

14:16.355 --> 14:21.526
around the side of it,
and seeing a strange light.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.363
It's a quite
extraordinary account.

14:25.522 --> 14:29.358
This close encounter event
was so remarkable

14:29.451 --> 14:32.028
to Fred Briggs that he thought
it was necessary

14:32.112 --> 14:36.040
to tell the actual owner
of this estate.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.535
And that just so happened
to be Lord Mountbatten,

14:39.628 --> 14:42.538
who was the uncle
of Prince Philip,

14:42.623 --> 14:44.799
who was married
to Queen Elizabeth.

14:44.884 --> 14:48.377
NARRATOR: At the time of the
sighting, Lord Louis Mountbatten,

14:48.470 --> 14:50.722
former governor general
of India,

14:50.881 --> 14:54.383
was the first sea lord
of the British Royal Navy.

14:54.476 --> 14:58.804
This is a UFO sighting
at the home

14:58.889 --> 15:00.982
of one of the most
senior figures

15:01.066 --> 15:03.234
in the British establishment.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.394
We know so much about this

15:05.487 --> 15:06.988
because they recorded
the whole thing.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.073
They actually took a statement
from the bricklayer,

15:09.158 --> 15:11.067
Lord Mountbatten
wrote up a report,

15:11.151 --> 15:13.077
they all signed them all.

15:13.236 --> 15:15.571
DOLAN: This, apparently,
was a very credible account,

15:15.664 --> 15:17.916
according to Lord Mountbatten.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.160
And he talked extensively
to Prince Philip about this.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.420
I mean, you have to assume
this whole thing

15:22.579 --> 15:24.005
went through the entire
royal household.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.674
You have to assume Queen
Elizabeth knew all about this.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.928
LINDA MOULTON HOWE: Lord
Mountbatten would have access

15:30.012 --> 15:35.341
as friends and colleagues
to the people in the MOD

15:35.425 --> 15:41.263
who were keeping the secret
information about UFOs and ETs.

15:41.357 --> 15:44.600
And that is my guess,
is the fuel

15:44.693 --> 15:47.111
that kept Prince Philip
so interested

15:47.196 --> 15:49.188
because they were
telling each other,

15:49.281 --> 15:51.866
"This is real, this is true."

15:52.025 --> 15:56.037
NARRATOR: While the royal
family was secretly investigating UFOs

15:56.121 --> 16:00.533
in the 1950s, so, too,
was the British government.

16:00.617 --> 16:05.121
In 1988, researchers
unearthed a five-page report

16:05.214 --> 16:09.208
from 1951, buried
in the National Archive,

16:09.292 --> 16:11.711
detailing the findings
of a group called

16:11.804 --> 16:14.630
the Flying Saucer Working Party.

16:14.715 --> 16:18.050
One of the British
government's first forays

16:18.143 --> 16:23.398
into the whole UFO mystery was
the Flying Saucer Working Party.

16:23.557 --> 16:26.308
It examined a range
of UFO sightings

16:26.402 --> 16:29.729
mainly reported
by military witnesses.

16:29.813 --> 16:35.901
HESELTINE: The Flying Saucer Working
Party met briefly for about 12 months.

16:35.986 --> 16:38.830
It comprised of five scientists,
and it was--

16:38.914 --> 16:43.751
Originally met
in October of 1950,

16:43.836 --> 16:47.088
and by June of 1951,
had produced a report.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.007
And the report basically said,

16:49.091 --> 16:52.510
"We're gonna debunk it,
following America's lead."

16:52.594 --> 16:54.420
DOLAN: I've always
interpreted this report

16:54.513 --> 16:57.265
as orders from above.

16:57.424 --> 17:01.427
You know, someone said, "Look,
we don't need the lower levels,

17:01.520 --> 17:05.598
uh, to start getting worked up
over these UFO reports."

17:05.691 --> 17:08.693
NARRATOR: The Flying Saucer
Working Party was shut down

17:08.777 --> 17:13.114
following the 1951 report,
but it inspired interest

17:13.273 --> 17:16.117
from prominent figures
within the British government,

17:16.201 --> 17:19.120
and led to further
investigations.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.865
POPE:
In 1952, Winston Churchill,

17:22.958 --> 17:25.785
back as prime minister
in the U.K.,

17:25.869 --> 17:29.288
said to the Air Ministry and
to his chief scientific adviser,

17:29.381 --> 17:32.383
"What does all this stuff
about flying saucers mean?"

17:32.468 --> 17:36.462
Just the year after
Churchill wrote that memo,

17:36.555 --> 17:39.715
the Ministry of Defence
actually set up the UFO program

17:39.808 --> 17:42.226
where I worked in later years.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.471
The government's
official position was,

17:45.564 --> 17:50.193
"There's nothing here to suggest
a reality to the phenomenon."

17:53.072 --> 17:57.742
I think the reality behind
closed doors was very different.

17:57.826 --> 18:01.996
And there have always been
those of us who felt

18:02.155 --> 18:04.907
this was
an extremely serious defense

18:04.991 --> 18:06.742
and national security issue.

18:06.835 --> 18:08.920
NARRATOR:
While the British government

18:09.079 --> 18:10.922
continues to be less
than forthcoming

18:11.006 --> 18:13.758
regarding its UFO
investigations,

18:13.842 --> 18:16.594
perhaps the world's
best model of transparency

18:16.753 --> 18:20.089
has emerged just across
the English Channel.

18:20.182 --> 18:24.352
In France, collaborative
efforts by space,

18:24.436 --> 18:27.605
military and government agencies

18:27.764 --> 18:31.025
have recently uncovered more
than 400 encounters

18:31.110 --> 18:34.904
that remain
entirely unexplained.

18:42.028 --> 18:44.697
NARRATOR: The National
Centre for Space Studies

18:44.781 --> 18:48.200
establishes an organization
to record eyewitness accounts

18:48.285 --> 18:52.463
of abnormal phenomena
observed in the sky.

18:52.622 --> 18:56.041
Known today as GEIPAN,
which, translated,

18:56.126 --> 18:59.044
stands for The Group
for Studies and Information

18:59.129 --> 19:02.223
on Unidentified Aerospace
Phenomena,

19:02.307 --> 19:05.893
the unit has amassed
more than 100,000 pages' worth

19:05.978 --> 19:08.229
of UAP reports.

19:08.313 --> 19:13.067
And in 2007, the group
did something unprecedented.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.979
It shared all of its files
with the public.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.065
France is quite unorthodox

19:20.159 --> 19:23.161
when it comes to how governments
are dealing with UFOs.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.488
They released
all their UFO data.

19:26.573 --> 19:27.990
And they said,
"Here's where we're at.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.575
"As we get new information,

19:29.659 --> 19:31.919
we're just gonna release it
to you, the public."

19:32.004 --> 19:34.172
They did something that
no one had ever done before.

19:34.331 --> 19:36.999
It was the first time
it had ever happened.

19:37.083 --> 19:39.084
CORBELL:
France is one of these countries

19:39.169 --> 19:41.754
that, both culturally
and also governmentally,

19:41.847 --> 19:45.099
have made a point to be
in front of the UFO issue.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.092
This is a rarity

19:47.186 --> 19:49.261
because of the national security
implications,

19:49.354 --> 19:54.183
but it shows us an opportunity
where the public can be informed

19:54.267 --> 19:57.603
alongside the government
with the fundamental reality

19:57.687 --> 19:59.614
that UFOs are real,

19:59.773 --> 20:03.284
that the presence on planet
Earth has been durational.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.786
It has been here a long time.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.539
And there is a mystery
that we need to look at.

20:08.624 --> 20:12.460
It is our right to know
and our duty to find out.

20:12.619 --> 20:16.297
NARRATOR: GEIPAN posted
information on their website

20:16.381 --> 20:20.960
on over 1,600 cases
and concluded that 28% of them

20:21.053 --> 20:24.388
cannot be explained
by conventional events.

20:24.547 --> 20:27.475
And a number of these
unexplained sightings

20:27.634 --> 20:30.970
were reported
by multiple witnesses.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.148
One of the most sensational
encounters took place

20:34.233 --> 20:36.892
more than 45 years ago
on a clear,

20:36.985 --> 20:39.895
cloudless night
at a combat flight school

20:39.980 --> 20:42.740
to the southwest of Paris.

20:42.899 --> 20:45.743
There was an incident
on March 3, 1976,

20:45.827 --> 20:48.821
when French fighter pilots were
engaged in a training mission.

20:48.905 --> 20:52.667
Every five minutes,
T-33 planes were taking off

20:52.751 --> 20:55.253
from the air base near Tours.

20:55.412 --> 21:00.666
NARRATOR: Flying solo
at an altitude of 20,000 feet,

21:00.759 --> 21:02.510
each student pilot
had to navigate a route

21:02.669 --> 21:04.095
of several hundred miles.

21:06.089 --> 21:07.765
CHILDRESS:
One of these pilots was flying

21:07.924 --> 21:11.593
with-with several other flights
just behind him.

21:11.678 --> 21:15.189
He suddenly saw
this huge, green fireball...

21:16.358 --> 21:19.018
coming straight at him.

21:19.102 --> 21:22.438
And in fact, he thought that
it was going to hit his plane,

21:22.531 --> 21:25.866
and he covered his eyes
and braced for impact,

21:25.951 --> 21:29.194
and just then,
this green fireball

21:29.279 --> 21:31.196
went off to one side

21:31.281 --> 21:35.126
and clipped the wing
of his jet fighter.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.296
He was amazed that he had
actually survived this,

21:38.455 --> 21:41.882
and had no idea what happened,
but two pilots behind him

21:41.967 --> 21:43.718
had seen the same thing.

21:43.802 --> 21:47.379
HENRY: Nothing was recorded
on the radar on the ground,

21:47.464 --> 21:49.390
but the fact remains,

21:49.474 --> 21:53.311
is that highly trained
military pilots saw this object.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.146
They couldn't explain
what they actually saw.

21:56.898 --> 21:58.816
NARRATOR:
Commercial airline pilots

21:58.900 --> 22:01.235
were also involved
in an extraordinary incident

22:01.320 --> 22:03.404
that occurred
over the French capital.

22:03.563 --> 22:06.398
This time
the reported UFO encounter

22:06.491 --> 22:09.068
took place in broad daylight.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.237
HENRY:
On January 28, 1994,

22:12.322 --> 22:14.999
Air France flight 3532

22:15.158 --> 22:18.660
was flying from Nice, France
to London, England.

22:18.745 --> 22:21.080
They were just over Paris
when, all of a sudden,

22:21.173 --> 22:24.917
the pilots reported seeing
an orangish-reddish disc

22:25.001 --> 22:29.513
about 30 miles away
that was changing its form.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.353
HOWE:
It transforms into a bell,

22:35.437 --> 22:39.857
from a bell into a lens,
from a lens back into a bell.

22:40.016 --> 22:44.269
And they kept
watching this transformation,

22:44.354 --> 22:47.606
which today, we know, this is
one of the key signatures

22:47.699 --> 22:49.608
in the UFO phenomena.

22:49.701 --> 22:52.277
CHILDRESS: Later, when
they made their report,

22:52.371 --> 22:58.117
they found out that radar
had also tracked this disc,

22:58.201 --> 23:00.628
and they had no explanation
for it at all.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.873
HENRY: These are just two
examples of the 400 incidents

23:04.966 --> 23:07.126
that could not be explained.

23:07.210 --> 23:10.304
NARRATOR: France's decision
to share its data with the public

23:10.389 --> 23:12.223
is unprecedented.

23:12.307 --> 23:16.135
Then again, their entire
approach to UAPs stands

23:16.219 --> 23:19.897
in stark contrast to the way
the rest of the world operates.

23:20.056 --> 23:24.652
POPE: If you look at the history
of government UFO programs,

23:24.736 --> 23:28.313
most nations that have had one
embed those programs

23:28.407 --> 23:32.410
in either the air force
or the department of defense.

23:32.569 --> 23:34.078
The French have
a different model.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.906
Their UFO program is embedded

23:37.991 --> 23:41.669
in their national space agency.

23:41.828 --> 23:44.588
GREENSTREET: And they're
provided with data from the military.

23:44.747 --> 23:49.260
And so, it's this trilateral
commission, almost,

23:49.344 --> 23:54.089
of space, public, military
and government working together

23:54.174 --> 23:57.926
to release to the public
current information on UFOs.

23:58.019 --> 24:01.597
POPE:
What you get is a less secretive

24:01.681 --> 24:05.434
and threat-orientated approach,

24:05.518 --> 24:08.854
and a more open
scientific inquiry.

24:08.947 --> 24:12.024
If you embed a UFO program
in the military,

24:12.108 --> 24:14.618
their first question is,
"Is this a threat?"

24:14.777 --> 24:17.696
If you embed it
in the scientific community,

24:17.780 --> 24:21.709
their question is, "What is the
true nature of this phenomenon,

24:21.793 --> 24:26.380
and can we do any scientific
experiments to validate this?"

24:26.465 --> 24:28.707
So, if you look at the way
things are done in France,

24:28.800 --> 24:32.136
that might be a model
for the future here in the U.S.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.713
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorists

24:34.806 --> 24:38.309
hope that France's collaborative
approach to UAP investigations

24:38.393 --> 24:40.886
becomes the norm
around the world.

24:40.970 --> 24:43.722
But even as more nations
seem willing

24:43.815 --> 24:46.734
to share information about UAPs,

24:46.818 --> 24:50.395
China, the Western world's
most secretive adversary,

24:50.489 --> 24:53.065
remains mostly silent.

24:53.158 --> 24:55.234
Recent developments, however,

24:55.327 --> 24:58.162
suggest they know more
than they are letting on.

25:04.744 --> 25:06.670
NARRATOR:
Hangzhou, China,

25:06.755 --> 25:10.341
July 7, 2010.

25:10.425 --> 25:14.178
Air traffic at Xiaoshan
International Airport,

25:14.262 --> 25:17.673
one of the busiest in the
entire nation, grinds to a halt

25:17.757 --> 25:21.477
when pilots spot a UFO
hovering over the runway.

25:23.846 --> 25:26.190
DOLAN: You have Chinese pilots
coming into the airport there

25:26.274 --> 25:29.184
and they actually are reporting
unusual-shaped object,

25:29.269 --> 25:31.195
unusual object maneuvering,

25:31.279 --> 25:33.939
uh, to the extent
that i-it prompted the airport

25:34.023 --> 25:36.700
to essentially shut down
for an hour.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.862
I think there were 18 flights
that were diverted away

25:40.956 --> 25:42.948
from the airport
during that hour.

25:43.032 --> 25:45.617
There was a lot of speculation
as to what this thing was,

25:45.702 --> 25:48.671
and we don't really have
an answer to this day.

26:02.561 --> 26:05.312
NARRATOR: Neither civilian
nor military authorities

26:05.397 --> 26:07.222
were able to identify
the object,

26:07.315 --> 26:08.890
and the Chinese government

26:08.975 --> 26:11.643
made no official comment
on the situation.

26:11.736 --> 26:14.646
But behind the scenes,

26:14.731 --> 26:16.490
the incident
and its implications

26:16.649 --> 26:18.659
worried Chinese officials,

26:18.743 --> 26:22.079
and an investigation
was launched.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.324
CHILDRESS: That incident
really shocked the Chinese.

26:25.408 --> 26:27.251
And at that point they thought,

26:27.335 --> 26:29.211
"Okay, we've got to see
what's going on here."

26:31.089 --> 26:35.751
NARRATOR: For decades, investigators
around the world suspected China

26:35.835 --> 26:39.346
had a deep interest in
unidentified aerial phenomena.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.933
But the Chinese government
is historically secretive,

26:43.018 --> 26:46.437
and members of the UFO community
have had difficulty

26:46.521 --> 26:50.515
obtaining information on
their methods of UAP research.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.192
POPE:
It's very difficult

26:52.352 --> 26:54.770
to extract reliable information

26:54.863 --> 26:59.274
about what countries like China
are doing in relation to UFOs.

26:59.359 --> 27:01.368
About the only thing
we know for sure

27:01.453 --> 27:04.780
is that there are government
programs looking at this.

27:04.864 --> 27:07.708
The Chinese government
is notoriously closed

27:07.792 --> 27:10.878
and secretive
on a range of issues,

27:11.037 --> 27:13.789
so it doesn't surprise me that
it's the case on UFOs as well.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.957
NARRATOR:
But in the 21st century,

27:16.051 --> 27:19.553
secrets have become
harder and harder to keep.

27:19.712 --> 27:23.632
The UFO sighting
at Xiaoshan Airport

27:23.716 --> 27:26.560
was only one of over 3,000
reported in China

27:26.719 --> 27:29.888
over the past two decades.

27:29.972 --> 27:33.317
And in the years that followed
the sightings at Hangzhou,

27:33.476 --> 27:35.727
China has undergone
a significant change

27:35.820 --> 27:39.323
in its approach to UAPs.

27:42.985 --> 27:45.570
China's Early Warning Academy,

27:45.664 --> 27:48.499
a division of the People's
Liberation Army Air Force,

27:48.583 --> 27:51.919
issues a government report
acknowledging an increase

27:52.003 --> 27:55.506
in what they refer to as
"unidentified air conditions."

28:03.339 --> 28:05.006
MICHAEL DENNIN:
So, in China, what we call

28:05.100 --> 28:07.259
"unidentified aerial phenomena,"
they call

28:07.352 --> 28:09.353
"unidentified air conditions,"

28:09.437 --> 28:11.355
and they've set up
new task force to look at this.

28:21.190 --> 28:22.941
DOLAN: China's getting
a lot of UFO reports,

28:23.025 --> 28:25.110
and one interesting thing
about what China does

28:25.203 --> 28:28.706
to collect UFO reports
is that they work very closely

28:28.790 --> 28:33.118
with all of these independent
Chinese UFO groups

28:33.202 --> 28:35.120
that are around the country.

28:35.204 --> 28:37.038
KNAPP:
Their public has UFO clubs

28:37.123 --> 28:39.550
that have a million
or more members.

28:39.634 --> 28:42.043
They have multiple clubs
that are so much bigger

28:42.137 --> 28:44.304
than our little,
tiny UFO groups--

28:44.464 --> 28:47.132
MUFON and things like that--
Which are very valuable.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.468
But compared to these
Chinese groups, oh, my gosh.

28:49.552 --> 28:50.561
It's-it's gigantic.

28:52.138 --> 28:54.139
DOLAN: There's no problem
in China for you to start up

28:54.223 --> 28:59.403
your own UFO group,
but you are absolutely

28:59.487 --> 29:02.156
going to be in communication
with Chinese authorities.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.909
And they actively monitor
every one of those groups.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.831
NARRATOR:
In 2019, in the same report

29:10.915 --> 29:13.492
that revealed
China's UAP program,

29:13.585 --> 29:16.828
Air Force Early Warning
Academy researcher Chen Li

29:16.921 --> 29:19.840
also stated that the country
would become the first

29:19.924 --> 29:23.668
in the world to use A.I.,
or artificial intelligence,

29:23.762 --> 29:27.672
to analyze all information
related to UAPs.

29:27.757 --> 29:32.177
POPE: It seems that they are
looking for patterns in the data

29:32.261 --> 29:37.691
to see historically whether
examination of past reports

29:37.850 --> 29:39.434
can throw up any patterns

29:39.527 --> 29:41.945
that human analysts
might have missed.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.356
And this is a very important
aspect for the future,

29:44.440 --> 29:47.284
as the technology improves.

29:47.443 --> 29:50.704
One of the things in the recent
report to the U.S. Congress

29:50.863 --> 29:54.374
was that the United States
needs to start doing this.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.369
We don't want a situation
where the Chinese government

29:57.453 --> 29:58.954
gets ahead of the game,

29:59.038 --> 30:01.215
so there's a gap
to be closed there.

30:03.802 --> 30:07.137
DOLAN: I can easily see
the benefit from having

30:07.222 --> 30:12.559
a very, very excellent program
to analyze these patterns.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.811
'Cause that's what
you're looking for,

30:13.970 --> 30:15.062
is you're looking
for anomalous patterns.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.305
And so, the fact
that China is announcing

30:17.390 --> 30:19.558
that they're doing it
was quite significant.

30:19.651 --> 30:23.311
CHILDRESS: The Chinese
have really stepped up

30:23.404 --> 30:27.482
their own official
UFO investigations,

30:27.567 --> 30:30.485
and it's the People's
Liberation Army itself

30:30.570 --> 30:32.404
that's spearheading this.

30:32.488 --> 30:35.907
NARRATOR:
Could events in China indicate

30:36.000 --> 30:38.752
that there is a global mandate
to share information

30:38.837 --> 30:42.080
about unidentified
aerial phenomena?

30:42.173 --> 30:45.417
While it may appear that
governments around the world

30:45.501 --> 30:47.177
are becoming more transparent,

30:47.262 --> 30:49.754
shocking statements
recently made

30:49.839 --> 30:51.932
by a pioneer
of space exploration

30:52.016 --> 30:55.343
may indicate
that much bigger secrets,

30:55.436 --> 30:59.648
with far greater implications,
continue to be closely guarded.

31:06.772 --> 31:09.032
NARRATOR:
Tel Aviv, Israel,

31:09.117 --> 31:12.694
December 2020.

31:12.778 --> 31:16.707
General Haim Eshed,
the former head

31:16.866 --> 31:19.459
of Israel's defense ministry's
space directorate,

31:19.619 --> 31:23.297
sits for an interview with
the<i> Yedioth Ahronoth</i> newspaper.

31:23.381 --> 31:26.717
What he reveals
is highly unexpected.

31:26.876 --> 31:29.136
General Eshed is quoted
as saying,

31:29.220 --> 31:32.556
"The UFOs have
asked not to disclose

31:32.640 --> 31:34.382
"that they are here.

31:34.467 --> 31:37.311
The human race
is not ready for them."

31:37.470 --> 31:41.732
He then proceeds to divulge
even more shocking revelations.

31:43.151 --> 31:45.894
CHILDRESS:
Haim Eshed said that

31:45.978 --> 31:49.823
the Americans and the Israelis
and-and other Western nations

31:49.908 --> 31:53.485
are a part of a federation
with extraterrestrials.

31:53.569 --> 31:55.654
And what he described was

31:55.747 --> 31:57.989
something similar
to what's in<i> Star Trek,</i>

31:58.082 --> 32:03.754
a galactic federation
of extraterrestrials,

32:03.838 --> 32:09.426
and they are wanting Earth
to join this federation.

32:09.510 --> 32:14.014
Eshed was the head
of Israel's defense ministry

32:14.173 --> 32:16.591
space programs for 30 years.

32:16.676 --> 32:19.511
And so, this is
an extremely credible person

32:19.595 --> 32:21.688
with this information.

32:21.773 --> 32:25.100
KNAPP: I can't imagine
someone more credible in Israel

32:25.184 --> 32:27.519
than Haim Eshed
to make those statements.

32:27.603 --> 32:30.188
He was the head
of, uh, space security,

32:30.281 --> 32:33.951
he was a general, he was
a professor, an engineer.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.777
He knows his stuff.

32:35.861 --> 32:39.531
He knows what's ours and what
isn't flying around out there.

32:39.615 --> 32:43.043
HOWE: Haim Eshed is one
of the most fascinating humans

32:43.202 --> 32:44.795
on this planet.

32:44.954 --> 32:47.631
He was personally responsible
for the overseeing

32:47.715 --> 32:52.636
and the launch of 20
critical satellites in Israel.

32:52.795 --> 32:56.223
He's saying it,
"We are not alone,"

32:56.307 --> 32:59.226
and then comes the other twist.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.721
It isn't humans
that are holding it back.

33:02.805 --> 33:06.891
It's the extraterrestrial
biological entities

33:06.976 --> 33:13.148
who said humans are not ready
for the introduction yet.

33:13.232 --> 33:16.401
It is obvious now

33:16.494 --> 33:22.082
that we have to harness
the advanced technologies,

33:22.241 --> 33:28.088
to join forces and create
this world, a better world.

33:28.247 --> 33:30.999
When someone like that comes out
with a story like this,

33:31.092 --> 33:34.678
everyone should sit up
and take notice.

33:34.762 --> 33:36.504
And yet, for a lot of people,
they're not either

33:36.589 --> 33:39.257
aware of this
or just write this off

33:39.341 --> 33:41.435
because it just sounds
too crazy.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.762
And yet it comes from someone

33:43.855 --> 33:47.607
who has operated at the heart
of the establishment.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.861
NARRATOR: Despite
General Eshed's high status

33:51.020 --> 33:53.697
as the father
of the Israeli space program,

33:53.856 --> 33:55.949
government officials
around the world

33:56.108 --> 34:00.195
remained largely silent
about his sensational claims.

34:00.279 --> 34:02.781
But did they refrain
from commenting

34:02.874 --> 34:05.542
because they found his claims
to be outlandish

34:05.626 --> 34:09.713
or because they were
protecting the same secret?

34:09.797 --> 34:13.884
It cannot be dismissed offhand
because there were others.

34:13.968 --> 34:18.305
One of them is Canada's
defense minister Paul Hellyer,

34:18.389 --> 34:22.050
who has said that there is
extraterrestrial contact

34:22.134 --> 34:26.229
going on between Earth
and extraterrestrial factions.

34:26.314 --> 34:30.308
NARRATOR:
On December 30, 2013,

34:30.401 --> 34:33.478
in an international television
news broadcast,

34:33.562 --> 34:36.823
former Canadian Minister of
National Defense Paul Hellyer

34:36.982 --> 34:39.826
made the astonishing statement
that he has knowledge

34:39.911 --> 34:42.829
of extraterrestrials
visiting Earth.

34:42.988 --> 34:46.324
Why do you say that UFOs are
as real as the airplanes

34:46.408 --> 34:48.418
flying over our heads?

34:48.577 --> 34:51.079
Well, because I know
that they are.

34:51.163 --> 34:54.666
And they've been visiting this
planet for thousands of years.

34:54.750 --> 34:58.845
And there is what is called
a federation of these people,

34:59.004 --> 35:00.505
and they have rules.

35:00.598 --> 35:04.592
When I first went public
and I said that UFOs are as real

35:04.685 --> 35:06.845
as the airplanes going overhead,

35:06.929 --> 35:08.263
I got the dubious distinction

35:08.347 --> 35:10.014
of being the first person
of cabinet rank

35:10.099 --> 35:12.267
to, uh, to say it categorically.

35:12.351 --> 35:15.946
The elected people
have been kept in the dark.

35:16.105 --> 35:20.275
I would say both the president
and the Congress.

35:20.359 --> 35:23.036
There have been presidents
who've wanted to know

35:23.121 --> 35:26.039
what was going on,
so, yes, the situation,

35:26.124 --> 35:28.950
I think, is not well understood.

35:29.034 --> 35:31.619
And this has been
going on for decades.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.706
So that is a,
is a matter of concern,

35:34.799 --> 35:38.793
and I think, uh, should continue
to be a matter of concern,

35:38.886 --> 35:40.628
uh, especially for Americans

35:40.713 --> 35:42.889
but also for the people
of the world.

35:43.048 --> 35:47.561
CHILDRESS: So here we have
two senior military personnel,

35:47.645 --> 35:49.721
one from Israel,
one from Canada,

35:49.805 --> 35:53.483
who are basically saying yes,
extraterrestrials are here,

35:53.568 --> 35:58.646
UFO activity is real,
and certain governments

35:58.731 --> 36:03.234
of planet Earth are in contact
with these extraterrestrials.

36:03.327 --> 36:04.569
What's going on?

36:04.653 --> 36:07.739
Are these people almost, like,

36:07.823 --> 36:10.491
trying to disclose themselves?

36:10.576 --> 36:14.337
Or are they part
of a wider strategy

36:14.422 --> 36:18.166
involving many different nations
all around the world

36:18.250 --> 36:22.420
working to try and find
a way to get this out?

36:22.504 --> 36:25.182
It's a difficult one, because
you can't ignore the backstory.

36:25.341 --> 36:28.092
If it was just a question
of saying

36:28.186 --> 36:30.929
"UFOs are extraterrestrial,
it's all true,"

36:31.013 --> 36:34.107
then fair enough,
but the backstory

36:34.266 --> 36:38.603
is that "We've been lying to you
about this for nearly 80 years."

36:38.696 --> 36:43.533
So, you got to find a way
to get it out there in a way

36:43.618 --> 36:47.779
that exonerates governments
all around the world

36:47.872 --> 36:49.530
from complicity

36:49.615 --> 36:53.284
in this decades-long
cover-up and conspiracy.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.378
How to do that?

36:55.537 --> 36:58.882
Well, maybe use these people
who have retired

36:58.966 --> 37:03.294
but are still obviously
connected and they're players.

37:03.379 --> 37:05.722
At that level,
you don't ever really leave.

37:05.806 --> 37:09.309
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the extraordinary claims

37:09.393 --> 37:11.728
of former high-ranking
government officials

37:11.887 --> 37:15.890
like Haim Eshed
and Paul Hellyer are true?

37:15.975 --> 37:19.152
Are there world leaders
who are not only aware

37:19.237 --> 37:22.814
of extraterrestrials
but in contact with them?

37:22.907 --> 37:25.909
Perhaps further clues
can be found by examining

37:25.993 --> 37:29.904
a recent agreement
that details how NATO nations

37:29.989 --> 37:34.334
will protect each other's
interests beyond Earth.

37:39.757 --> 37:44.085
NARRATOR:
Brussels, June 2021.

37:44.169 --> 37:47.180
President of the United States
Joe Biden

37:47.339 --> 37:49.841
attends the 31st NATO summit

37:49.934 --> 37:53.344
along with 30 other
world leaders and dignitaries.

37:53.429 --> 37:57.440
Among the items on the agenda
is an agreement between members

37:57.599 --> 38:00.018
to expand the collective
defense clause,

38:00.111 --> 38:02.854
also known as Article 5.

38:02.947 --> 38:07.367
In addition to land, sea, air
and cyberspace,

38:07.451 --> 38:10.278
NATO nations will now protect
one another's safety

38:10.371 --> 38:14.541
and national interests in space.

38:14.625 --> 38:16.209
POPE:
What's particularly significant

38:16.294 --> 38:19.871
about this is it was
the first NATO summit

38:19.955 --> 38:21.622
that President Biden attended.

38:21.707 --> 38:25.126
So here we have
a-an incoming president

38:25.210 --> 38:29.806
who makes this a key part
of his initial business.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.635
There's no getting away
from the fact that space

38:34.720 --> 38:40.066
will be a key battlefield
in any future conflict.

38:40.151 --> 38:43.903
The only question arises,
conflict with who or what?

38:44.063 --> 38:46.573
Some people say the real forces

38:46.657 --> 38:49.659
that they're concerned about
are extraterrestrial.

38:51.662 --> 38:53.738
NARRATOR:
NATO leaders claim

38:53.822 --> 38:57.167
the expansion of Article 5 was
made to address their concerns

38:57.251 --> 38:59.836
about increasingly aggressive
behavior in space

38:59.920 --> 39:02.246
by China and Russia.

39:02.331 --> 39:05.592
But could this actually be
the first collective agreement

39:05.751 --> 39:09.087
between nations preparing
for the possibility of a threat

39:09.171 --> 39:12.265
from an alien civilization?

39:12.424 --> 39:16.761
And is it one more step towards
greater government transparency?

39:16.854 --> 39:21.358
HOWE: We are at 2021
headed toward 2050,

39:21.442 --> 39:26.780
when Elon Musk says he will have
a million humans on Mars.

39:26.864 --> 39:30.867
Are we now, in the next decade,
going to be introduced

39:30.951 --> 39:36.122
to revelation after revelation,
country by country,

39:36.207 --> 39:41.702
treaty by treaty,
until the entire planet

39:41.796 --> 39:43.871
has finally stepped up
to the plate

39:43.956 --> 39:47.875
on all political
and military secrets?

39:47.960 --> 39:49.552
Could it happen that way?

39:51.213 --> 39:53.798
POPE:
After nearly 80 years of denying

39:53.882 --> 39:56.726
and debunking and downplaying,

39:56.811 --> 40:02.065
now is the time for governments
to step forward and own this.

40:02.149 --> 40:07.904
Time and time again we see this
concept that cooperation is key.

40:08.063 --> 40:10.740
It's only when nations
collaborate

40:10.899 --> 40:13.910
that we will be able
to fully understand

40:14.069 --> 40:16.654
and respond
to the UFO phenomenon.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.739
Mr. Secretary General,

40:18.824 --> 40:20.992
honored guests
and distinguished delegates...

40:21.076 --> 40:23.161
TSOUKALOS:
In one of his speeches

40:23.254 --> 40:27.424
in 1987, President Reagan
made the suggestion

40:27.508 --> 40:31.761
that if Earth would receive
a threat from outer space,

40:31.846 --> 40:37.341
that this would unify world
cultures from around the planet.

40:37.426 --> 40:40.770
Can we and all nations
not live in peace?

40:40.855 --> 40:45.442
I occasionally think how quickly
our differences worldwide

40:45.601 --> 40:49.946
would vanish if we were
facing an alien threat,

40:50.030 --> 40:51.698
from outside this world.

40:51.782 --> 40:55.368
TSOUKALOS: I don't look
at the extraterrestrial question

40:55.453 --> 41:00.123
as a threat, but rather
an extension of who we are

41:00.282 --> 41:03.034
or how we even
got here long ago.

41:03.127 --> 41:06.204
What if you have all the nations
around the world

41:06.288 --> 41:08.631
pull together their resources

41:08.790 --> 41:11.468
and research
the extraterrestrial question?

41:11.552 --> 41:15.138
And guess what.
There is an incredible chest--

41:15.297 --> 41:19.050
A war chest--
Of indications from the past

41:19.134 --> 41:25.806
all the way to the present that
what we see today is not new.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.984
NARRATOR:
Are world leaders

41:28.143 --> 41:30.978
beginning to seriously
consider the possibility

41:31.071 --> 41:33.156
that unidentified
aerial phenomena

41:33.315 --> 41:36.743
are, in fact,
of extraterrestrial origin?

41:36.827 --> 41:39.746
And could the profound
implications

41:39.830 --> 41:42.323
of an alien presence on Earth

41:42.407 --> 41:46.503
lead to greater collaboration
between nations,

41:46.587 --> 41:51.007
uniting to prepare
for an incredible new reality?

41:51.166 --> 41:54.001
Perhaps the visitors
in our skies

41:54.094 --> 41:56.596
have been watching us all along,

41:56.755 --> 42:00.016
and only when the world
comes together will it finally

42:00.175 --> 42:03.686
be revealed
that we are not alone.
