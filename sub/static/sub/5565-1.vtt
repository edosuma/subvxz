Bend the rules</i>

So let's have some fun!</i>

01:37.195 --> 01:41.199
<i>That I ever

<i>Let's be legendary</i>

02:17.002 --> 02:17.803
See?

02:17.838 --> 02:18.604
Shoot.

02:18.636 --> 02:19.738
It's no problem.

02:20.372 --> 02:22.006
Chloe,
I love you.

02:22.039 --> 02:24.075
But that's the absolute last
time I let you drive my car.

02:24.776 --> 02:26.045
What?

02:26.077 --> 02:27.913
Liv said she was
gonna be late for work.

02:27.945 --> 02:30.115
Better late
than dead!

02:30.147 --> 02:32.283
Seriously, Chlo, how does
anyone who lives so carefully

02:32.317 --> 02:34.118
<i>drive like Vin Diesel in
Fast and the Furious?</i>

02:34.152 --> 02:36.622
Hey, I am nothing
like Vin Diesel!

02:36.654 --> 02:37.856
I got it.

02:38.323 --> 02:39.325
Am I?

02:39.357 --> 02:41.159
Don't worry.

02:41.193 --> 02:42.895
She's just stressed out because
this is our last weekend together.

02:44.162 --> 02:46.064
And, for the safety of everyone.

02:46.831 --> 02:48.166
Thank you.

02:48.201 --> 02:48.201
Fine.

02:53.904 --> 02:55.006
Hey,
you're late.

02:56.707 --> 02:58.043
Better me
than my period.

03:00.344 --> 03:02.113
You're 18,
my watch is over.

03:03.782 --> 03:05.117
Thanks for helping out.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.451
No problem.

03:06.486 --> 03:07.753
And fyi...

03:07.785 --> 03:08.887
Romeo negative's here.

03:14.693 --> 03:15.827
You okay?

03:15.861 --> 03:18.163
Yeah. I mean...

03:18.195 --> 03:21.099
We're bound to run into
each other some time, right?

03:21.133 --> 03:24.069
Still. Out of, like, a
billion coffee shops in LA

03:24.101 --> 03:25.204
he has to
come here?

03:25.236 --> 03:26.638
I mean,
the relationship's over.

03:26.671 --> 03:28.740
He's just gonna have to
accept it, that's all.

03:29.741 --> 03:31.176
Do you want me
to Taser him?

03:31.208 --> 03:33.111
'Cause I can have him like,
flailing on the ground,

03:33.145 --> 03:34.647
foaming at the mouth
in like, 10 seconds.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.115
Thanks.
I'm good.

03:36.147 --> 03:37.547
-Okay? Thought I'd ask...
-Yeah.

03:37.582 --> 03:40.285
Can you just grab a table and I'll
get you something from the kitchen?

03:41.986 --> 03:44.088
Seriously...
Not those eyes.

03:44.122 --> 03:45.324
Guys, what do you
want to eat?

03:45.856 --> 03:47.325
That.

03:47.359 --> 03:48.694
I'll take the usual.

03:48.726 --> 03:50.428
Usual, it is.

03:50.462 --> 03:52.297
Hey, Sid.

03:56.134 --> 03:58.970
Shoot,
that's unfortunate.

03:59.004 --> 04:00.839
You know, I'm sorry about
that. It was an accident.

04:00.872 --> 04:02.241
You know...

04:02.273 --> 04:04.742
While I have you here,
would you mind

04:04.776 --> 04:05.945
grabbing me
a refill?

04:08.180 --> 04:09.748
No problem.

04:10.949 --> 04:12.385
Thanks, man.

04:13.151 --> 04:14.420
Thank you...

04:14.452 --> 04:15.654
Jerk.

04:22.027 --> 04:23.462
One of those
days?

04:23.495 --> 04:24.730
Know any good
hit men?

04:24.762 --> 04:26.799
Sorry.

04:26.832 --> 04:28.067
Already called in
all my favors.

04:30.936 --> 04:33.972
You, expecting
somebody?

04:34.005 --> 04:36.041
No...
I was just...

04:36.073 --> 04:38.109
It's nothing.
Anyway...

04:38.142 --> 04:40.083
Since tonight is your
last open mic night

04:40.084 --> 04:41.746
before you leave
us all for school,

04:41.779 --> 04:43.147
I put you on
top of the list.

04:43.181 --> 04:45.250
Thanks.

04:45.282 --> 04:47.253
A lot of songs have
come out of this place.

04:48.352 --> 04:49.354
A lot of life.

04:50.154 --> 04:51.390
You're so deep.

04:51.423 --> 04:53.158
Shut up.

04:53.190 --> 04:54.760
Anyway, you have
five minutes,

04:54.792 --> 04:56.127
so maybe play that one
good song you have?

05:00.866 --> 05:02.767
You know, it's killing
him that you're leaving?

05:02.801 --> 05:04.401
-Don't start.
-Okay.

05:04.436 --> 05:06.070
What did I miss?

05:06.104 --> 05:08.774
Nothing. Just more
of the ongoing saga

05:08.806 --> 05:10.975
of Syd and the
love-struck boy giant.

05:11.008 --> 05:12.378
Liam's my neighbor.

05:13.277 --> 05:15.080
My buddy.

05:15.113 --> 05:16.849
I mean, we took baths
together when we were four.

05:16.882 --> 05:18.383
What?

05:18.416 --> 05:20.452
I did not take baths
with my buddies.

05:20.484 --> 05:22.487
Okay, look.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.123
Come on, Syd. When's the last
time you hooked up with anybody?

05:25.791 --> 05:26.959
I've kissed...

05:28.426 --> 05:29.960
-Lots of guys.
-When?

05:29.995 --> 05:31.262
Like, recently?

05:32.931 --> 05:34.767
Define "recent."

05:34.799 --> 05:37.802
Syd, you do know that
going more than a month

05:37.835 --> 05:39.103
without a guy's tongue
in your mouth is, like,

05:39.137 --> 05:41.470
-highly detrimental to your health...
-Okay, okay, that's gross.

05:41.505 --> 05:43.439
-No, no, it's a scientific fact.
-Okay...

05:43.474 --> 05:44.575
Are you telling me
about science right now?

05:44.609 --> 05:45.377
It's...
I read somewhere...

05:45.412 --> 05:46.145
Is that what's happening?

05:46.178 --> 05:47.445
She's trying to tell me
about science.

05:47.479 --> 05:49.080
I'm just trying
to help you, Syd.

05:49.113 --> 05:50.916
I'm just
looking out for you.

05:52.183 --> 05:55.354
<i>Okay, so she's five feet
and I'm six foot infinity,</i>

05:55.387 --> 05:57.022
<i>that's why the mic
looks like this.</i>

05:57.054 --> 05:59.190
<i>Everyone, please give
a warm welcome</i>

05:59.224 --> 06:01.058
<i>for our very own,</i>

06:01.092 --> 06:02.361

06:05.063 --> 06:08.400

dream girl if I want</i>

06:10.368 --> 06:14.339
<i>Become everything

06:15.907 --> 06:19.779
<i>I could be somebody's
nightmare if I want</i>

06:21.412 --> 06:25.049
<i>Take a perfect fantasy
and burn it up</i>

06:25.984 --> 06:29.555
<i>Hidin' away</i>

06:31.423 --> 06:36.327
<i>Hidin' away tonight</i>

06:38.563 --> 06:41.300
<i>So what?
Call me a wonder</i>

06:41.332 --> 06:44.035
<i>'Cause I don't fall deep</i>

06:46.371 --> 06:49.373
<i>Nothing on my sleeve</i>

06:49.407 --> 06:52.176
<i>So what,
Two happy endings?</i>

06:52.210 --> 06:55.113
<i>Kissing is the world</i>

06:55.145 --> 06:57.282
<i>My heart can't
keep pretending</i>

06:57.315 --> 07:00.252
<i>Okay, here we go</i>

07:02.087 --> 07:03.956
<i>Here we go</i>

07:05.022 --> 07:06.825
<i>Here we go</i>

07:07.558 --> 07:09.327
<i>Here we go</i>

07:11.162 --> 07:13.899
<i>Even if I'm down
and barely breathing</i>

07:13.931 --> 07:16.568
<i>Even if I'm standing
ten feet tall</i>

07:16.601 --> 07:19.438
<i>I will let you know
just how I'm feelin'</i>

07:19.471 --> 07:23.475
<i>Or if I do at all</i>

07:23.508 --> 07:26.245
<i>So what?
Call me a wonder</i>

07:26.277 --> 07:29.147
<i>'Cause I don't fall deep</i>

07:29.179 --> 07:31.349

08:03.748 --> 08:06.083
<i>I'm gonna miss
playing here for you guys.</i>

08:06.116 --> 08:08.354
Yeah, Sydney!

08:12.457 --> 08:13.375
That was amazing.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.293
Thanks, Chlo.

08:14.592 --> 08:15.594
I agree.

08:16.594 --> 08:18.330
Was that something
you wrote?

08:18.363 --> 08:20.632
Thanks. Yeah, it's...
It's one of mine.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.303
I'm Austin Nicholas. I'm
with Starmageddon Records.

08:26.502 --> 08:26.502
You're kidding.

08:26.537 --> 08:28.073
Yeah, I know, that...

08:28.106 --> 08:29.541
That sounds like
a total line.

08:29.573 --> 08:31.575
Sorry,
it's just...

08:31.609 --> 08:33.510
Not a lot of record
labels come through here.

08:33.544 --> 08:35.481
Well, lucky me.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.350
You have
a unique sound.

08:38.381 --> 08:40.217
And your voice,
it's very soulful.

08:40.250 --> 08:41.953
And rich.

08:41.986 --> 08:44.054
I could do a lot with
you, if you're interested.

08:45.155 --> 08:46.424
I don't know,
I...

08:46.457 --> 08:48.592
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's interested.

08:48.625 --> 08:52.264
She loves music more than
anybody I've ever known.

08:52.297 --> 08:54.433
You know, her mom used
to be a concert pianist.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.135
And, who are you?

08:57.168 --> 08:59.438
I'm Chloe. I'm her
friend. I'm not a singer.

08:59.471 --> 09:01.606
I'm going to be a
molecular epidemiologist.

09:01.639 --> 09:03.308
Well, I have no idea
what that is,

09:03.341 --> 09:05.277
but it's good to
meet you, Chloe.

09:05.309 --> 09:09.046
Listen, we're shooting a video
for one of our acts tomorrow.

09:09.079 --> 09:11.415
You should swing by, check
it out... See how you fit.

09:11.448 --> 09:12.450
Yeah!

09:12.485 --> 09:13.452
Wait...

09:13.485 --> 09:14.519
You're serious?

09:14.554 --> 09:15.553
Absolutely.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.121
I wouldn't be standing
here if I wasn't.

09:21.025 --> 09:22.260
And...

09:22.293 --> 09:23.428
Who are you?

09:24.462 --> 09:26.097
"Austin Nicholas."

09:27.499 --> 09:29.268
Somebody who can change
your friend's life.

09:31.302 --> 09:32.404
I hope to hear
from you, Sydney.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.542
Wait...

09:37.574 --> 09:39.176
Wait, can you change
my life, too?

09:39.209 --> 09:40.511
Is that an option?

09:42.414 --> 09:44.316
Hello?

09:44.348 --> 09:47.085
Star-magaddon.

09:47.452 --> 09:49.121
Geddon.

09:49.154 --> 09:50.289
Starmageddon.

09:57.327 --> 09:59.398
Like a charm.

09:59.430 --> 10:01.232
When're you gonna put that
thing out of its misery?

10:01.265 --> 10:03.601
The Bomb'll
live forever!

10:03.635 --> 10:05.404
What, "forever"?
She's already dead!

10:05.405 --> 10:06.404
She's one of the girls.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.406
<i>One of The Golden Girls.</i>

10:08.640 --> 10:10.708
I tell you what.
Why don't you

10:10.741 --> 10:13.077
let me take care of her
while you're gone?

10:13.111 --> 10:15.646
I'll... I'll...
I'll check the tires,

10:15.679 --> 10:17.481
and... And clean
the engine...

10:17.515 --> 10:18.784
I don't know anything
about cars, but I'll...

10:18.817 --> 10:20.419
I'll learn all that
manly stuff.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.187
What about your
"big trip"?

10:22.220 --> 10:24.689
You know, cross-country,
making your big documentary?

10:24.722 --> 10:26.625
Yeah, that's
on hold for now.

10:26.658 --> 10:27.242
Why?

10:27.277 --> 10:27.826
Why?

10:27.858 --> 10:29.693
Because I don't have
any money, that's why!

10:29.726 --> 10:31.163
Yeah, I need

10:31.196 --> 10:32.464
a new computer,
I need a new camera,

10:32.496 --> 10:33.731
I need money
for gas...

10:33.765 --> 10:35.199
What about your
parents?

10:35.232 --> 10:36.566
-Trish and Darren?
-Yeah.

10:36.601 --> 10:39.171
They will not be subsidizing
this particular dream.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.173
They're still trying to
figure out how, and I quote,

10:41.206 --> 10:43.475
"Their son could
forsake Caltech

10:43.507 --> 10:45.810
"to roam the country
like a bum with a camera."

10:45.843 --> 10:47.545
Those were their
exact words, verbatim.

10:47.578 --> 10:49.246
How mean is that?

10:49.279 --> 10:50.549
Well,
they're wrong.

10:51.482 --> 10:52.550
You know you're great.

10:57.355 --> 10:59.191
Woo!

10:59.223 --> 11:01.792
Who's ready for the last
night of our carefree youth?

11:01.826 --> 11:03.195
Yay, Liv is
here now.

11:04.661 --> 11:06.063
Hey, Spielberg.

11:06.097 --> 11:07.366
Can you go back inside and

11:07.367 --> 11:08.730
-make some lattes 'cause...
-That's your job.

11:08.765 --> 11:11.236
My mom just gave me
the weekend off!

11:11.269 --> 11:13.105
I know, I know.

11:13.138 --> 11:13.888
It's "end of the world"

11:13.889 --> 11:14.571
-worthy but fear not...
-It is.

11:14.606 --> 11:17.476
'cause we're gonna have
an amazing time...

11:17.509 --> 11:19.377
-Without you.
-Yeah!

11:19.409 --> 11:21.244
-Feel so un-included.
-You are.

11:21.279 --> 11:23.448
I really wish I could
hang out with you, Liv.

11:23.481 --> 11:25.183
I know.

11:25.216 --> 11:27.219
Thanks, Liam.
I'll call you later.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.819
-You'd better.
-Bye, M. Night Sucksalot.

11:28.852 --> 11:30.287
Okay, Liv.
Have fun in college.

11:30.321 --> 11:32.424
That stings.

11:32.457 --> 11:33.635
Are you two ever going to

11:33.636 --> 11:35.106
-try and like each other?
-No.

11:35.107 --> 11:36.493
-Quick question.
-Yeah?

11:36.528 --> 11:37.659
-Can I drive?
-No!

11:37.694 --> 11:39.263
That's fine.

11:39.297 --> 11:40.731
I was getting in
over here, anyway.

11:40.765 --> 11:42.333
I could take that.

11:42.368 --> 11:42.368
Yes, thanks.

11:43.568 --> 11:44.485
Got it?

11:44.520 --> 11:45.403
Okay.

11:45.435 --> 11:47.872
So, where are we headed
this fine evening?

11:47.905 --> 11:51.142
Well, I figure we'd hit all
the traditional hotspots...

11:51.175 --> 11:53.344
Pier. Hunt down
some Dogtown.

11:53.377 --> 11:54.812
Cruise the west
side a little

11:54.846 --> 11:56.881
and, of course,
we can't forget...

11:56.914 --> 11:58.466
-Please, do not say "karaoke."
-Karaoke!

11:58.467 --> 12:00.651
-No!
-You know you love it.

12:00.684 --> 12:02.154
It stresses me out.

12:02.819 --> 12:04.823
You guys ready?

12:04.858 --> 12:05.790
Yeah.

12:05.825 --> 12:06.758
Yup.

12:06.790 --> 12:09.361
<i>to fight
For the night because</i>

12:09.394 --> 12:13.298
<i>We are warriors</i>

12:13.331 --> 12:15.167
<i>We are the warriors</i>

12:15.199 --> 12:16.867
<i>Weekend warriors</i>

12:16.900 --> 12:21.173
<i>We are warriors</i>

12:21.206 --> 12:22.707
<i>We are the warriors</i>

12:22.740 --> 12:24.576
<i>Weekend warriors</i>

12:25.543 --> 12:27.312
If you could do
anything...

12:27.345 --> 12:29.314
Be anything...

12:29.347 --> 12:31.413
-What would you do?
-That's easy.

12:31.448 --> 12:33.284
I'd go to Columbia,
of course.

12:33.318 --> 12:35.654
And then I'd be the first
woman to create a vaccine.

12:36.286 --> 12:37.755
All right.

12:37.789 --> 12:39.624
I get that you're
saving the world and all,

12:39.656 --> 12:41.692
but I mean something
more immediate...

12:41.726 --> 12:43.962
And fun
and daring?

12:43.995 --> 12:47.698
Hey, no. "Fun and daring" should never
be used in the same sentence, ever!

12:47.731 --> 12:48.900
I've got it,
you guys.

12:49.766 --> 12:52.203
We'll make a list.

12:52.236 --> 12:54.238
Like a... Of what?
What kind of list?

12:54.271 --> 12:55.706
Like a bucket list.

12:55.740 --> 12:57.976
A bucket list?
What are we, 300?

12:58.009 --> 12:59.844
Okay, fine...

12:59.876 --> 13:01.313
YOLO list.

13:01.346 --> 13:02.480
Better?

13:02.513 --> 13:04.549
Nah...

13:04.582 --> 13:06.351
We'll make a list of things
that scare us.

13:06.384 --> 13:08.587
Things we've always
wanted to do but haven't.

13:08.620 --> 13:12.791
And then we'll swear to absolutely
do those things by Sunday midnight.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.558
You got me
hooked, girl.

13:14.592 --> 13:15.243
I like it.

13:15.278 --> 13:15.894
I gotta say.

13:15.927 --> 13:17.229
Sound like a plan?

13:17.261 --> 13:18.012
Yeah.

13:18.047 --> 13:18.763
I'm in.

13:20.265 --> 13:22.766
Well, it's not
particularly scary

13:22.799 --> 13:25.502
and I'd probably have to
get it lasered off.

13:25.535 --> 13:26.670
Are you kiddin' me
right now?

13:26.703 --> 13:28.539
Really missing
the point here, Liv.

13:28.573 --> 13:30.741
Okay.

13:30.775 --> 13:33.944
I could tell my mom I'm
quitting the coffeeshop.

13:33.977 --> 13:35.778
-Finally, that's a good one.
-No!

13:35.813 --> 13:37.249
That's not scary.

13:37.281 --> 13:38.515
Are you kidding me?

13:38.549 --> 13:42.353
My mom would go
DEFCON 5 if I quit.

13:42.386 --> 13:45.623
It's funny. DEFCON 5 is actually
the least severe state of alert.

13:45.656 --> 13:47.289
-Did you know that?
-No.

13:47.324 --> 13:49.627
DEFCON 1 is the most...
It's a common misconception.

13:50.928 --> 13:51.928
And I'll believe you quitting

13:51.929 --> 13:52.961
-the coffeshop when I see it.
-There she is.

13:52.996 --> 13:56.467
Quitting's definitely
a good thing, but...

13:56.500 --> 13:58.270
Let's ramp this puppy
up a little.

13:58.303 --> 13:59.705
Okay...

14:01.338 --> 14:02.323
Bungee jumping.

14:02.358 --> 14:03.308
Yeah, with you.

14:04.308 --> 14:06.410
I can't do...
Okay...

14:06.443 --> 14:08.512
I'd TP RJ's
house with you.

14:08.545 --> 14:09.946
-I already did that.
-When?

14:09.981 --> 14:11.616
Sorry, I should've
called you.

14:11.649 --> 14:13.548
-Skinny dipping.
-Yes.

14:13.583 --> 14:14.785
Not with me.

14:15.486 --> 14:16.686
-Nose ring?
-Yes!

14:16.721 --> 14:17.688
Also, not with me.

14:17.722 --> 14:20.692
I've got it! You have
to apply to Juilliard.

14:21.390 --> 14:21.390
Yes.

14:21.425 --> 14:23.294
No, I just...

14:23.327 --> 14:24.728
Time to face
those fears, right?

14:24.761 --> 14:26.363
Face 'em,
baby.

14:26.396 --> 14:28.766
Okay, Captain Danger.

14:28.799 --> 14:30.733
-What are you gonna do?
-Next.

14:30.768 --> 14:32.337
I'm gonna
get a hot dog.

14:33.904 --> 14:35.707
Just go for it,
Chlo.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.342
First thing that
comes to your mind.

14:38.842 --> 14:41.376
-It's not as easy as you thought?
-Hey!

14:41.411 --> 14:43.281
I just want it to be,
you know...

14:43.948 --> 14:46.583
Appropriate.

14:46.618 --> 14:47.584
Boring!

14:47.619 --> 14:48.586
Fine, okay.

14:48.619 --> 14:49.921
I want to do
something wild.

14:51.956 --> 14:54.359
Great, but we need
specifics.

14:54.391 --> 14:55.693
I know.

14:55.726 --> 14:57.629
You have to
throw a rager.

14:57.661 --> 14:59.363
What is
a "rager"?

14:59.396 --> 15:00.631
A rager's like

15:00.664 --> 15:02.798
-an end of the summer blowout.
-No, absolutely not.

15:02.833 --> 15:04.433
-And your parents are in London.
-It's perfect.

15:04.468 --> 15:06.470
See, they would kill me
if I did that.

15:06.504 --> 15:07.739
Actually,
they'll ground me,

15:07.771 --> 15:09.039
then they'll
disinherit me.

15:09.073 --> 15:10.408
And then they
will kill me.

15:10.441 --> 15:11.476
So you have nothing
to worry about.

15:11.509 --> 15:12.777
Only if they
find out.

15:12.809 --> 15:13.811
Which they won't.

15:15.813 --> 15:17.414
Fine.

15:17.448 --> 15:19.650
But it has to be small
and tasteful and intimate.

15:19.683 --> 15:21.486
I need all those words
to be written down.

15:21.519 --> 15:23.388
We can get
real intimate.

15:23.420 --> 15:24.855
My goodness. What
about you, Sydney?

15:25.490 --> 15:26.890
What're you
gonna do?

15:26.924 --> 15:28.726
I don't know.

15:28.760 --> 15:30.462
Finding some cute guy
to hook up with

15:30.495 --> 15:31.929
sounded like
a pretty good goal.

15:31.962 --> 15:33.564
Nice.

15:33.597 --> 15:35.500
But, come on,
let's get real.

15:35.533 --> 15:36.601
What about that
record label guy?

15:36.634 --> 15:37.635
Yeah...

15:38.702 --> 15:40.538
Well...

15:40.571 --> 15:42.574
He's a little bit
older but...

15:42.606 --> 15:45.076
No, I meant like
meeting him...

15:45.108 --> 15:46.026
Are you gonna meet him?

15:46.061 --> 15:46.944
Like professionally.

15:46.977 --> 15:48.412
But, you know
you can...

15:48.446 --> 15:49.459
You know, you could do

15:49.460 --> 15:50.746
-whatever you want, though.
-Do whatever you want.

15:50.781 --> 15:53.016
Okay, as far as the whole
record label thing,

15:53.049 --> 15:56.755
I mean, I'm moving to the entire
opposite side of the country.

15:56.788 --> 15:58.090
Aren't you the least
bit curious?

15:58.789 --> 15:59.791
Sure.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.393
But I don't see what
meeting with some

16:01.394 --> 16:03.794
record label dude has
to do with who I am.

16:03.827 --> 16:05.764
And besides, I'm
already just, you know...

16:05.797 --> 16:06.831
Scared?

16:06.866 --> 16:07.866
Called out.

16:07.899 --> 16:09.301
I didn't say that!

16:09.333 --> 16:12.603
And you think throwing a rager or
whatever it's called is who I am?

16:16.707 --> 16:18.409
Fine. Fine.

16:18.875 --> 16:19.810
There you go.

16:20.711 --> 16:25.984
"Meet with
record label dude."

16:27.651 --> 16:29.585
-"And bonus...
-Bonus?

16:29.620 --> 16:31.789
"End of summer
hook-up."

16:31.823 --> 16:35.025
Okay, nobody said you had to do
two things little Miss Sydney.

16:35.058 --> 16:37.962
Yeah, but, the hook-up
thing sounded kind of fun.

16:37.995 --> 16:39.831
I'm so excited.

16:39.864 --> 16:42.033
Maybe we should
get this notarized.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.702
-Thoughts?
-Not tonight, Chlo.

16:44.735 --> 16:46.101
-Okay, maybe tomorrow?
-Okay.

16:46.136 --> 16:47.805
Okay, cool.

16:48.706 --> 16:50.775
Who does that?

16:50.808 --> 16:53.711
<i>They say she's
So perfect</i>

16:53.744 --> 16:56.648
<i>No tears,
No scraped knees</i>

16:56.680 --> 16:59.683
<i>Like glass on the surface</i>

16:59.717 --> 17:02.953
<i>She tries to break free</i>

17:02.986 --> 17:05.989
<i>Take a chance
Who cares if you fall down?</i>

17:06.022 --> 17:08.827
<i>Stand up, time to face
Who you are now</i>

17:08.859 --> 17:13.598
<i>Don't wait,
It's so worth it all</i>

17:14.564 --> 17:17.801
<i>They say she's
So pretty</i>

17:17.834 --> 17:20.871
<i>She has everything</i>

17:20.905 --> 17:23.942
<i>Trapped heart
Barely beating</i>

17:23.974 --> 17:27.044
<i>Magic in her feet</i>

17:27.078 --> 17:30.114
<i>Take a chance, speak out,
let your fears go</i>

17:30.147 --> 17:33.016
<i>Stand up and dance
Down your own road</i>

17:33.050 --> 17:38.755
<i>Don't wait,
It's so worth it all</i>

17:38.788 --> 17:42.993
<i>We are gonna
Live tonight</i>

17:43.026 --> 17:44.928
<i>And never say never!</i>

17:44.961 --> 17:49.500
<i>We will make it
Do or die</i>

17:49.534 --> 17:51.201
<i>And never say never!</i>

17:51.235 --> 17:54.138
<i>Put your hands up
Like a flame we will rise</i>

17:54.170 --> 17:57.007
<i>Live for the moment
There's no wrong or right</i>

17:57.041 --> 18:01.579
<i>We are gonna
Live tonight</i>

18:01.611 --> 18:02.948
<i>And never say never!</i>

18:04.982 --> 18:08.052
<i>They say she's
A love song</i>

18:08.084 --> 18:11.088
<i>A secret melody</i>

18:11.121 --> 18:13.925
<i>High hopes
She hangs on</i>

18:13.957 --> 18:17.094
<i>She can
Bring the heat</i>

18:17.128 --> 18:20.098
<i>Take a chance
Kiss your worries goodbye</i>

18:20.130 --> 18:23.234
<i>Stand up
Let your freak flag fly high</i>

18:23.266 --> 18:28.907
<i>Don't wait,
It's so worth it all</i>

18:28.939 --> 18:33.544
<i>We are gonna
Live tonight</i>

18:33.578 --> 18:35.046
<i>And never say never</i>

18:35.079 --> 18:39.217
<i>We will make it
Do or die</i>

18:39.249 --> 18:41.318
<i>And never say never!</i>

18:41.351 --> 18:44.188
<i>Put your hands up
Like a flame we will rise</i>

18:44.220 --> 18:47.257
<i>Live for the moment
There's no wrong or right</i>

18:47.291 --> 18:51.563
<i>We are gonna
Live tonight</i>

18:51.595 --> 18:53.097
<i>And never say never!</i>

18:57.834 --> 19:00.071
<i>Never say,
never say, never!</i>

19:00.103 --> 19:01.139
Maybe him?

19:02.172 --> 19:03.775
He's kind of cute.

19:03.807 --> 19:05.609
You still have
the whole weekend.

19:05.642 --> 19:06.844
Super cute...

19:10.948 --> 19:14.686
Hi, my name is Sydney, and I'm
on the hunt for some hot guys.

19:16.687 --> 19:17.688
What are you doing?

19:22.192 --> 19:23.661
My gosh.
Really?

19:24.328 --> 19:25.930
What are we,
five?

19:25.963 --> 19:29.935
<i>Hi, my name is Sydney, and I'm
on the hunt for some hot guys.</i>

19:32.035 --> 19:34.639
Would you mind pushing
her off the pier for me?

19:34.671 --> 19:35.739
What is that,
a new app?

19:35.773 --> 19:38.208
Technology is
my life, okay?

19:38.242 --> 19:40.211
And I get to be a really cute
puppy dog in this one.

19:40.244 --> 19:41.312
So I like it.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.380
Hashtag "nerd."

19:42.412 --> 19:44.649
Hastag "no new friends."

19:46.883 --> 19:50.253
So, I guess we can all agree
that tonight was zero fun?

19:50.286 --> 19:52.723
It was
the best night ever.

19:53.423 --> 19:54.858
Seriously.

19:54.893 --> 19:54.893
Aw.

19:57.227 --> 19:58.763
I'm gonna
miss you guys.

19:58.795 --> 20:00.398
Me, too.

20:00.430 --> 20:02.967
Can we save the tears
for home, under a blanket?

20:02.999 --> 20:04.701
With ice-cream
or something?

20:04.735 --> 20:05.336
Yeah.

20:05.371 --> 20:05.937
Okay.

20:12.776 --> 20:14.211
Dad?

20:14.245 --> 20:15.347
Hey, I'm in
the kitchen.

20:18.282 --> 20:20.986
Did we get robbed or
am I being evicted?

20:21.785 --> 20:23.420
Evicted.

20:23.454 --> 20:25.657
Yeah, notice is
on your door.

20:25.689 --> 20:28.359
Nah, I figure you're 18. I've had
my eye on your room for a while now.

20:28.391 --> 20:30.428
And... Yeah, I'm gonna
turn it into my batcave.

20:32.063 --> 20:34.399
So, what are
you really up to?

20:34.431 --> 20:36.034
Nothing...
I was just...

20:36.867 --> 20:38.369
Just looking for
something.

20:38.401 --> 20:40.371
It's not important.

20:40.403 --> 20:42.073
How was your night?

20:42.108 --> 20:42.108
It was good.

20:43.173 --> 20:44.341
I'm beat.

20:44.374 --> 20:45.376
Well...

20:46.843 --> 20:49.980
I did put,
milk on the stove.

20:50.014 --> 20:52.917
Hot chocolate is a mere seconds
away if you care to join.

20:52.949 --> 20:54.151
Have I ever
said "no"?

21:08.265 --> 21:09.332
What's going on?
You're doing that...

21:09.365 --> 21:11.101
That teen-zombie
stare thing.

21:13.938 --> 21:15.140
Just been
all over the place.

21:16.239 --> 21:18.308
Thinking.

21:18.342 --> 21:20.277
You know, you can always
just stay here for the next...

21:20.311 --> 21:22.146
I don't know,
30 years or so.

21:22.178 --> 21:24.181
You know, just to
clear your head.

21:26.217 --> 21:28.252
And what about your
"batcave"?

21:28.284 --> 21:30.688
Well,
we all make sacrifices.

21:33.056 --> 21:34.793
Seriously,
you good?

21:35.892 --> 21:37.062
Something
happened today.

21:43.167 --> 21:44.901
He was at The Brew
during my song and

21:44.935 --> 21:47.004
wants to work
with me.

21:47.036 --> 21:48.773
He thinks I have
a unique sound.

21:51.307 --> 21:54.044
Does he know you're leaving
for college on Monday morning?

21:54.078 --> 21:56.748
I don't know it... It all
happened kind of fast and...

21:56.781 --> 21:59.451
Now Chloe and Liv are
pushing me to go check it out.

22:01.851 --> 22:02.954
Well, you're not
going to, right?

22:03.353 --> 22:05.922
Dad...

22:05.956 --> 22:07.792
I'm... I'm sorry, the idea that
you're even considering this

22:07.824 --> 22:10.495
48 hours before you're
supposed to leave...

22:10.527 --> 22:11.962
Because some random guy
gives you his business card.

22:11.996 --> 22:13.264
He's not some
random guy.

22:15.466 --> 22:17.235
That label
is a big deal.

22:17.267 --> 22:18.303
So is college.

22:19.035 --> 22:20.371
I know.

22:20.403 --> 22:21.205
You know...

22:22.806 --> 22:23.474
It's just...

22:25.042 --> 22:26.144
I don't know.

22:27.945 --> 22:29.114
Mom was a musician.

22:31.916 --> 22:34.185
I guess I kind of wonder
what she'd say about all this.

22:38.922 --> 22:39.990
Yeah, I would, too.

22:42.226 --> 22:44.262
But I got to be
honest with you,

22:44.294 --> 22:46.429
it scares me to
think that you'd

22:46.463 --> 22:48.332
throw all that hard work
away for this.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.502
And your mom
would, too.

22:54.537 --> 22:56.406
But what if it's what
I'm supposed to do?

23:01.011 --> 23:02.847
I don't know.

23:05.015 --> 23:07.017
I think that's something you're
gonna need to figure out for yourself.

23:11.188 --> 23:12.857
Well,

23:12.890 --> 23:14.258
thanks for the cocoa.

23:15.024 --> 23:15.024
Yeah.

23:15.059 --> 23:16.327
Night, dad.

23:17.861 --> 23:18.963
Night, Syd.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.492
<i>Your mom would
be proud of you, Syd.</i>

23:48.525 --> 23:51.896
<i>Every day I go home and
I think she's still there.</i>

23:55.298 --> 23:57.399
Then I remember...

23:58.369 --> 24:01.005
I'm just alone.

24:04.173 --> 24:07.277
Okay, I wasn't going
to say anything

24:07.311 --> 24:09.280
but this feels
like the right time.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.049
Chloe and I have been
talking and, well,

24:13.082 --> 24:15.585
we've decided we're
moving in with you.

24:15.619 --> 24:16.986
Liv!

24:17.021 --> 24:19.991
And I know, it'd be a tight squeeze
with my expensive dance wardrobe,

24:20.024 --> 24:21.559
and Chloe's
cardigans, and...

24:21.592 --> 24:24.361
Cardigans are a practical
fashion choice.

24:24.394 --> 24:25.929
So are matching
fanny packs.

24:25.963 --> 24:27.198
Which
reminds me...

24:27.230 --> 24:29.633
I was gonna wait till
the start of summer,

24:29.667 --> 24:30.635
but...

24:36.340 --> 24:39.143
Chlo,
these are insane.

24:39.176 --> 24:41.445
I just thought, as
long as we wore these

24:41.477 --> 24:43.014
we'll always be
connected.

24:43.546 --> 24:45.582
No matter what.

24:45.615 --> 24:47.284
<i>Things are
gonna get better, Syd.</i>

24:48.252 --> 24:49.621
<i>We'll always be
here for you.</i>

25:13.310 --> 25:14.312
Hey, Liam.

25:15.579 --> 25:17.448
Whoa!

25:17.480 --> 25:19.650
That was like the most
depressing "hey" I've ever heard.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.219
Whatever happened
to your "epic" night?

25:23.253 --> 25:24.304
Not that great?

25:24.339 --> 25:25.356
No, it was...

25:26.357 --> 25:28.626
It was great,
actually.

25:28.659 --> 25:31.496
I'm just a little
overwhelmed right now.

25:32.595 --> 25:36.099
Still have so much
packing to do.

25:36.132 --> 25:38.302
Well, if you want
I could come over.

25:38.334 --> 25:39.469
I don't know if you
know this about me but

25:39.503 --> 25:41.172
I'm a bit of
a tape wizard

25:41.205 --> 25:45.042
and I also just developed
really cute pictures of my puppy.

25:47.044 --> 25:51.015
Actually, I do know that whole
thing about you being a tape wizard

25:51.047 --> 25:52.616
and it's a little weird.

25:55.185 --> 25:56.053
Can we talk
tomorrow?

25:57.254 --> 25:59.623
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm just tired.

26:00.657 --> 26:02.460
Sure.

26:04.594 --> 26:06.697
Anyway, I just called
to say "goodnight."

26:06.729 --> 26:07.698
And...

26:11.399 --> 26:11.401
And?

26:13.236 --> 26:15.073
And that's it.

26:16.573 --> 26:19.476
Well, thanks for
checking in on me.

26:21.745 --> 26:23.147
Nighty, Liam.

26:23.580 --> 26:24.549
Nighty, Syd.

26:42.733 --> 26:46.270
<i>All these voices in my head
They echo</i>

26:46.303 --> 26:50.041
<i>Sitting patiently
waiting for them to let go</i>

26:50.073 --> 26:53.576
<i>I feel you
hide in the light</i>

26:53.610 --> 26:57.648
<i>That I can see you
No, I can see you</i>

26:57.680 --> 27:03.187
<i>'Cause fear's
covering my mouth</i>

27:03.219 --> 27:05.488
<i>And the words
won't come out</i>

27:05.522 --> 27:10.227
<i>And I'm
burning to the ground</i>

27:11.294 --> 27:13.598
<i>Won't you come and save me?</i>

27:15.332 --> 27:18.436
<i>From feeling hostage</i>

27:18.468 --> 27:21.038
<i>Baby, all I really need</i>

27:21.839 --> 27:23.674
Don't stop
because of me.

27:23.707 --> 27:24.842
What are you
doing here?

27:24.874 --> 27:26.676
Having my mind blown!

27:26.709 --> 27:28.478
I mean, that was
just... "Wow."

27:29.345 --> 27:30.515
Thanks.

27:31.247 --> 27:33.516
I'm practicing.

27:33.550 --> 27:36.687
Doesn't matter, though. Aren't you
supposed to be at a video shoot?

27:36.719 --> 27:38.389
What do you mean
"it doesn't matter"?

27:38.421 --> 27:40.256
When they see what I just
saw it's gonna be a lock.

27:40.290 --> 27:43.260
Okay, can we not do the friend
therapist thing right now?

27:43.293 --> 27:44.495
Okay,
what's the problem?

27:44.527 --> 27:45.563
Things are
going great.

27:45.595 --> 27:48.399
It's time to focus on
doing something for you.

27:48.431 --> 27:50.300
I know.
You're right.

27:50.333 --> 27:52.169
Sydney, what are you
doing here?

27:52.170 --> 27:54.304
-I know, right?
-Shouldn't you be at Starmageddon,

27:54.338 --> 27:55.706
meeting with
the record guy?

27:55.739 --> 27:57.640
Becoming a star... Does this mean
I don't have to throw the party?

27:57.673 --> 27:59.309
No. Syd,

27:59.342 --> 28:01.144
you told me to
follow my rainbow.

28:01.178 --> 28:02.646
You're totally dropping
yours at the curb.

28:02.678 --> 28:04.849
Sydney, don't drop
your rainbow.

28:04.881 --> 28:06.182
That's very sad.

28:06.216 --> 28:08.252
My rainbow is fine.

28:08.284 --> 28:11.322
I just figured how could I go
to my first big music video shoot

28:11.354 --> 28:13.223
without my
best friends?

28:13.256 --> 28:15.325
Okay, good save.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.594
I'm disgusting.

28:17.629 --> 28:18.829
Yeah, you are.

28:18.861 --> 28:20.764
I'm glad your
rainbow's okay.

28:20.796 --> 28:22.265
But you can't
go like that.

28:24.234 --> 28:25.335
What?

28:25.370 --> 28:26.437
Chloe?

28:26.469 --> 28:28.360
-Grab my make-up bag.
-Okay. Sorry.

28:28.361 --> 28:29.806
Syd, please go to my closet,

28:29.840 --> 28:32.810
get something that makes you look
like you don't shop at Justice.

28:32.842 --> 28:34.245
Go!

28:34.277 --> 28:35.512
Is it the owls?

28:36.947 --> 28:38.616
What would they
do without me?

29:08.544 --> 29:09.813
She already got in?

29:14.951 --> 29:16.419
Chloe, other room.

29:18.655 --> 29:20.858
Okay, let's see
what you...

29:21.525 --> 29:23.226
Picked.

29:23.259 --> 29:25.228
So? What do
you think?

29:26.697 --> 29:28.232
No.

29:51.220 --> 29:51.220
Hey...

29:51.255 --> 29:53.724
This is so exciting.

29:53.756 --> 29:55.825
I've never been to a real
music video shoot before.

29:57.561 --> 29:59.697
Can you believe
this is all free?

29:59.729 --> 30:01.631
Please, make it look like
you've seen food before.

30:01.665 --> 30:03.367
You're gonna embarrass me
in front of the band.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.468
When did you become
such a huge fan?

30:05.502 --> 30:07.271
Since like,
forever ago.

30:07.303 --> 30:09.340
Plus, I want to invite
them to Chloe's rager.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.908
Whoa! Whoa! How many
people have you invited?

30:10.940 --> 30:12.875
Are we counting
the Twitter blast?

30:12.909 --> 30:16.479
Liv, I thought we were
keeping my rager "small."

30:16.513 --> 30:18.381
Please. There's no such
thing as a "small rager."

30:18.415 --> 30:19.483
Sydney McAvoy?

30:20.650 --> 30:22.385
Yes? No? Maybe?

30:22.419 --> 30:23.754
Hi. I'm Sydney McAvoy.

30:24.821 --> 30:26.590
That's me.

30:26.622 --> 30:28.292
I would've also
accepted, "Yes."

30:28.324 --> 30:29.360
My name is Jasmine.

30:29.392 --> 30:30.893
Just Jasmine.

30:30.927 --> 30:33.296
Austin Nicolas sent me to
escort you to his office.

30:33.330 --> 30:34.965
Third floor.
Follow me please.

30:34.997 --> 30:36.533
Is it cool if my...

30:36.565 --> 30:38.302
Playmates stay here.

30:38.334 --> 30:39.803
That's fine. I'll
take your purse.

30:39.835 --> 30:42.338
You're gonna do great.
You look gorgeous.

30:42.371 --> 30:43.940
Fluff. Open.

30:45.441 --> 30:46.710
Okay. Knock
'em dead.

30:49.478 --> 30:50.948
"Just Jasmine."

30:50.980 --> 30:52.749
I bet her last name's
something really stupid,

30:52.783 --> 30:54.584
like Broccolini.

30:54.618 --> 30:56.787
Hey! I just
had a thought.

30:56.820 --> 30:59.356
What if Austin is
her hook-up buddy?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.525
-What?
-Older man. Super-attractive.

31:01.557 --> 31:02.525
Kill two birds
and all that.

31:02.559 --> 31:04.595
No. Is he
even her type?

31:04.628 --> 31:05.861
-If he's breathing, he's her type.
-No...

31:05.896 --> 31:07.965
She only has till midnight
tomorrow to make it happen.

31:08.765 --> 31:09.967
Hey, guys.

31:09.999 --> 31:11.567
What's so...

31:11.601 --> 31:12.870
What's with
the outfits?

31:12.902 --> 31:14.371
What're you doing here?

31:14.403 --> 31:16.372
I'm shooting behind
the scenes stuff.

31:16.406 --> 31:17.541
Where's Sydney?

31:17.576 --> 31:18.676
She's upstairs...

31:18.708 --> 31:20.611
Meeting with
Austin Nicholas.

31:20.643 --> 31:21.878
Yeah?

31:21.911 --> 31:23.579
The record company guy?

31:23.612 --> 31:24.980
-She's up there right now?
-Yeah.

31:25.015 --> 31:26.417
Alone with him?

31:26.449 --> 31:27.484
Is she gonna be,
like, okay?

31:27.516 --> 31:28.584
I mean, yeah,
she's okay.

31:28.618 --> 31:30.454
She's in a, you know
fancy office,

31:30.486 --> 31:33.524
with a guy who wants to make her
the "Star" of Star-mageddon Records.

31:33.556 --> 31:34.658
Starmageddon.

31:34.690 --> 31:35.224
Whatever.

31:35.259 --> 31:35.759
She's okay.

31:36.692 --> 31:38.728
But where is the band?

31:38.762 --> 31:39.963
They're in hair
and make-up.

31:39.996 --> 31:41.431
And...

31:41.465 --> 31:42.933
Where exactly would
hair and make-up be?

31:42.966 --> 31:44.802
Let it go, Liv. We're
not meeting the band.

31:44.834 --> 31:47.504
Yeah. Sorry. Only extras
can go to hair and make-up,

31:47.536 --> 31:49.340
and you guys
aren't extras. So...

31:49.372 --> 31:51.107
I mean, you could
very easily be extras.

31:51.140 --> 31:53.409
You just have to be nice
to the right person.

31:53.442 --> 31:55.445
You? You
can get us in?

31:55.478 --> 31:56.746
I can get you
in, Chloe.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.382
Not you though. 'Cause I
don't like you very much.

31:58.415 --> 31:59.883
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.820
I take back everything I've ever said
in life that was negative about you.

32:02.852 --> 32:04.688
And I replace it
with positive.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.390
You're a brilliant film-maker,

32:06.422 --> 32:07.590
you have great hair,

32:07.623 --> 32:09.360
and your eyebrows are
almost cleaned up.

32:10.526 --> 32:11.996
Extra! Extra!

32:12.963 --> 32:13.997
I hate you so much.

32:14.030 --> 32:15.499
April!

32:15.532 --> 32:16.699
April!

32:16.733 --> 32:19.536
Who's April? Security?
Not security.

32:19.569 --> 32:21.972
All right. These girls
are extras. They got lost.

32:22.005 --> 32:23.806
What are you doing down
here, looking like this?

32:23.840 --> 32:25.442
I need you
camera-ready.

32:25.475 --> 32:26.843
Come on. I need to get
you into hair and make-up

32:26.877 --> 32:28.412
before Rowan chews
me out for this too.

32:28.445 --> 32:31.548
Stupid director, like it's my fault we
ran out of Red Bull. Come on. Let's go.

32:31.581 --> 32:32.548
Did you catch any of that?

32:32.583 --> 32:33.516
Don't pay me enough
for this.

32:34.450 --> 32:35.919
You're welcome,
by the way.

32:40.157 --> 32:41.658
Yup. Bye.

32:42.926 --> 32:43.928
Sydney McAvoy.

32:45.594 --> 32:47.163
I like that look.

32:47.197 --> 32:48.431
Thanks.

32:48.465 --> 32:49.830
-We got water. You good?
-Yeah.

32:49.865 --> 32:51.434
Okay. Come and
have a seat.

32:52.869 --> 32:54.905
Well. Thanks
for coming in.

32:54.938 --> 32:56.506
I've got to be honest. I didn't think
you're gonna show up after yesterday.

32:56.540 --> 32:57.741
Yeah. Listen...

32:57.774 --> 32:59.008
About yesterday,

32:59.042 --> 33:01.712
I guess I'm just naturally
a suspicious person.

33:01.745 --> 33:03.546
Well, hey. It's,
it's okay.

33:03.580 --> 33:04.915
I totally get it.

33:04.948 --> 33:07.517
So, what do you think
of the shoot so far?

33:07.551 --> 33:08.752
It's pretty cool.

33:08.785 --> 33:12.022
Who knows, we could be out there
shooting your video someday.

33:12.054 --> 33:13.923
I can't imagine
all of this for me.

33:13.957 --> 33:15.892
Well, maybe it's
time we changed that.

33:17.460 --> 33:18.728
I listened to your
demo, Sydney.

33:19.661 --> 33:19.661
My demo?

33:19.696 --> 33:21.732
It's incredible.

33:21.765 --> 33:22.966
I mean, if you
put in the work,

33:22.998 --> 33:24.934
we can make you
a huge star.

33:24.967 --> 33:26.637
Now, I'm talking
about number one records,

33:26.669 --> 33:28.772
Grammys, VMA's
everything.

33:28.804 --> 33:30.306
I don't know. I've...

33:30.340 --> 33:33.177
I've never really thought of myself
as a mainstream artist. I just like...

33:33.209 --> 33:35.978
That's exactly what
makes you so special.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.984
See, people need an
artist they can relate to.

33:41.884 --> 33:43.753
And with a
little work,

33:43.786 --> 33:45.054
you could be the
complete package.

33:46.489 --> 33:47.323
You're serious?

33:47.358 --> 33:49.226
It's all about figuring
out your brand.

33:49.258 --> 33:53.130
Are you more Ariana
Grande or Iggy Azalea?

33:53.162 --> 33:54.864
I guess...
I'm just me.

33:57.501 --> 33:58.736
Of course you are.

33:59.835 --> 34:02.005
I'm leaving on Monday
for college.

34:02.037 --> 34:04.607
Well...

34:04.640 --> 34:05.976
School's not
for everybody.

34:07.710 --> 34:10.813
You just say the word. I can
have you in the studio next week.

34:13.983 --> 34:15.452
Do I have to say
yes or no right now?

34:16.150 --> 34:17.487
No. Of course not.

34:17.521 --> 34:18.789
Think it over.

34:18.822 --> 34:20.255
I, I tell you what,

34:20.289 --> 34:21.425
I'll call you tomorrow.

34:21.456 --> 34:23.092
If you think this is
something you're interested in,

34:23.626 --> 34:24.893
great.

34:24.927 --> 34:26.596
If not, it's
totally cool too.

34:27.795 --> 34:28.931
It's no pressure.

34:30.166 --> 34:30.967
Deal?

34:32.702 --> 34:33.937
Deal.

34:33.969 --> 34:35.672
All right. I like
to shake on a deal.

34:35.704 --> 34:37.607
Get out of here, kiddo.

34:39.608 --> 34:40.610
And Sydney?

34:42.043 --> 34:45.547
I really want you
to consider one thing.

34:45.581 --> 34:47.984
What's the point of making
music if nobody hears it?

34:55.791 --> 34:57.861
I look just like
Lady Gaga.

34:59.896 --> 35:00.997
I'm gonna go
wait over there.

35:01.030 --> 35:01.965
Okay.

35:02.898 --> 35:04.534
Careful.

35:04.568 --> 35:06.102
Watch your step.

35:06.135 --> 35:08.538
Bigger.

35:08.572 --> 35:09.807
Okay, sure.

35:14.644 --> 35:16.080
Excuse me.
Coming through.

35:16.115 --> 35:16.115
Excuse me.

35:24.621 --> 35:25.990
Whoa!

35:26.722 --> 35:28.324
Isn't that dangerous?

35:28.358 --> 35:29.959
Well, only if I fall.

35:29.992 --> 35:32.862
I'm sorry. I'll try
not to distract you, then.

35:32.896 --> 35:34.664
Well, it's a little
late for that.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.965
I'm already distracted.

35:37.867 --> 35:39.303
I'm really sorry.

35:39.336 --> 35:42.773
I like your hair. Reminds
of a giant birds nest.

35:42.805 --> 35:44.840
It's not usually like this.
It's usually like...

35:44.874 --> 35:47.529
Like really, like, straight.
And it's like long and stuff.

35:47.530 --> 35:48.075
-I like it.
-Okay.

35:48.110 --> 35:49.611
-I want to show you something.
-Okay.

35:49.646 --> 35:50.678
-Come up here.
-Okay.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.615
Take your shoes off.

35:52.648 --> 35:54.250
It's really hard to walk
in it. So, thank you.

35:56.086 --> 35:58.021
Get up on here.

35:58.053 --> 35:59.222
This is squishy.

35:59.255 --> 36:00.823
Is this what the moon
feels like?

36:00.856 --> 36:02.692
Yeah something
like that.

36:02.726 --> 36:04.361
Okay, right here?

36:04.394 --> 36:04.978
Perfect.

36:05.013 --> 36:05.563
Okay.

36:06.329 --> 36:07.131
Wait, where are
you going?

36:13.003 --> 36:14.171
My name's Broom.

36:14.204 --> 36:15.839
They call me that
'cause I

36:15.872 --> 36:17.274
sweep up the competetion.

36:18.775 --> 36:20.177
My name's Chloe.

36:21.177 --> 36:22.813
Because my parents

36:22.845 --> 36:24.314
named me that.

36:24.981 --> 36:26.082
Nice.

36:26.983 --> 36:29.151
Hey! I have a question.

36:29.184 --> 36:32.188
Do you wanna come to
a party tomorrow night?

36:32.222 --> 36:34.390
Yeah. I'm down.

36:34.423 --> 36:35.224
It's in my house.

36:36.191 --> 36:36.191
Okay.

36:36.226 --> 36:38.160
It's a rager.

36:38.193 --> 36:39.796
I'll be there.

36:41.296 --> 36:42.800
Take care.

36:45.968 --> 36:46.970
Hey, Sydney.

36:48.238 --> 36:50.407
One more thing.

36:50.439 --> 36:53.242
Little something for you to listen
to while you think things over.

36:53.276 --> 36:55.078
This would be a
great sound for you.

36:55.110 --> 36:56.112
Thanks.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.015
I'll call you tomorrow.

37:01.450 --> 37:02.718
Hey!

37:02.753 --> 37:03.986
My...

37:04.019 --> 37:05.822
What happened to
you guys?

37:05.854 --> 37:06.923
How did it go?

37:06.956 --> 37:09.215
Yeah. Are you going
to be like famous or what?

37:09.216 --> 37:11.060
I...
Well...

37:11.093 --> 37:13.329
He definetely wants
to work with me.

37:13.363 --> 37:14.331
And...

37:14.363 --> 37:15.698
He said he could
turn me into something huge.

37:15.731 --> 37:17.000
Huge?

37:17.800 --> 37:18.834
He actually said huge.

37:18.867 --> 37:20.436
That's amazing, Syd.

37:20.470 --> 37:21.972
Your dreams are
coming true.

37:22.005 --> 37:23.773
I guess so. Right?

37:23.807 --> 37:25.042
We're so happy
for you.

37:25.075 --> 37:26.743
I'm so proud of you.

37:26.776 --> 37:28.178
In other
incredible news,

37:28.211 --> 37:30.380
I met a guy.

37:30.412 --> 37:31.881
It's actually true
this time. She did.

37:31.914 --> 37:32.648
Date.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.381
Okay.
Well...

37:33.416 --> 37:35.686
He's a stuntman. His name's
Broom. He's over there.

37:35.718 --> 37:37.820
Isn't he flawless.

37:37.854 --> 37:41.756
-Yeah. And he's very silvery.
-Yeah.

37:41.791 --> 37:44.760
Well, because he's a robot
dancer from the future.

37:44.793 --> 37:45.928
You know what we are?

37:45.961 --> 37:46.862
We are...

37:46.897 --> 37:47.764
Vambots.

37:47.796 --> 37:49.464
In the dance emporium.

37:49.499 --> 37:51.133
-You should be one.
-Yes!

37:51.166 --> 37:52.869
I don't think
that's a...

37:52.901 --> 37:54.406
-Absolutely. April!
-April!

37:54.407 --> 37:56.439
We have an extra.

37:56.472 --> 37:58.407
She just appears out
no where. Watch.

37:58.408 --> 37:59.676
-Tada!
-What're you waiting for?

37:59.709 --> 38:01.295
Come one. Lets go.
We're rolling in 15.

38:01.296 --> 38:03.447
-She does that too.
-Are you trying to kill me!

38:03.482 --> 38:03.482
It's just a rush.

38:03.517 --> 38:04.682
It's a rush.

38:06.014 --> 38:07.316
Thanks for making
me come today, guys.

38:07.349 --> 38:09.285
Yeah, yeah,
yeah,

38:09.318 --> 38:11.220
<i>Let me catch my breath</i>

38:11.253 --> 38:14.390
<i>Tattoo your shadow
on my silhouette</i>

38:14.423 --> 38:17.260
<i>Sun's a gutter rider
when the summer sets</i>

38:18.762 --> 38:21.997
<i>But it ain't over yet</i>

38:22.030 --> 38:24.166
<i>We can kiss and run</i>

38:24.200 --> 38:27.303
<i>Tasting the stars
melting on our tongues</i>

38:27.336 --> 38:30.340
<i>From Memphis to Moz
we're getting lost in love</i>

38:31.374 --> 38:34.745
<i>And can you feel the rush?</i>

38:35.445 --> 38:37.280
<i>Do it right</i>

38:38.548 --> 38:40.383
<i>One last time</i>

38:41.550 --> 38:43.753
<i>Lose our minds</i>

38:44.521 --> 38:47.390
<i>Tonight</i>

38:47.423 --> 38:50.427
<i>We kiss in the moonlight
We're making it backside</i>

38:50.459 --> 38:53.863
<i>We won't let it go</i>

38:53.896 --> 38:55.364
<i>We're staring at sunshine</i>

38:55.398 --> 38:56.967
<i>No reason to be blind</i>

38:56.999 --> 39:00.169
<i>We're keeping it going</i>

39:00.202 --> 39:03.405
<i>We kiss in the moonlight</i>

39:03.439 --> 39:07.945
<i>We kiss in the moonlight</i>

39:10.345 --> 39:13.180
-Are you freaking out or what?
-Of course.

39:13.215 --> 39:15.484
I mean, a part of me thinks I
should just stick to the plan,

39:15.517 --> 39:17.153
like it'd be crazy to even
think about staying

39:17.186 --> 39:19.054
but then there's another
part of me that just...

39:19.088 --> 39:22.092
That wonders what it would be
like to be internationally famous?

39:22.124 --> 39:23.760
Well, let's not get
carried away, Chlo.

39:24.827 --> 39:25.996
Tribal stuff.

39:27.963 --> 39:30.400
Did you ever notice that for
being a National Merit Scholar,

39:30.432 --> 39:31.967
Chlo has an attention
span of a goldfish?

39:32.001 --> 39:33.003
Yup.

39:36.472 --> 39:39.109
So this morning
when I came over,

39:39.142 --> 39:41.077
I haven't seen you dance
like that in a long time.

39:41.110 --> 39:44.113
You just seemed
so happy.

39:44.146 --> 39:47.183
Yeah. I mean, it's the
only place I feel free now.

39:47.217 --> 39:50.452
Otherwise I feel like I'm
gonna trapped here. Forever.

39:50.485 --> 39:51.788
Well, that's not
going to happen.

39:53.055 --> 39:55.358
Liv, you've
worked so hard.

39:55.390 --> 39:56.959
You deserve a spot
in that school.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.296
It almost sounds
real when you say it.

40:00.329 --> 40:01.430
Well...

40:01.463 --> 40:03.265
I'd hate to be the
bearer of bad news,

40:03.298 --> 40:06.836
but your destiny does not
involve making vanilla lattes.

40:08.338 --> 40:09.506
Thanks.

40:09.539 --> 40:12.242
Whoa! Whoa-whoa-whoa!
There's hugging?

40:12.275 --> 40:14.543
What did I miss?

40:14.577 --> 40:16.613
That stuff is really cool, but
I think it's voodoo. Let's go.

40:19.148 --> 40:22.318
Okay, so that's last of all
the super-breakable stuff.

40:22.352 --> 40:23.353
It will be safe
during the party.

40:24.419 --> 40:25.622
You really think so?

40:25.655 --> 40:28.298
-Yeah, try not to worry so much, Chlo.
-Okay.

40:28.299 --> 40:29.431
I got it.

40:29.432 --> 40:29.924
-Hold a little tighter.
-Okay.

40:29.959 --> 40:32.229
A little further back,
so it doesn't fall off.

40:33.162 --> 40:35.998
That really is one
creepy-looking doll.

40:36.032 --> 40:37.901
Don't tell that to my mom.

40:37.934 --> 40:39.169
Lucinda is her favorite.

40:40.403 --> 40:42.606
She got her at some antique mall

40:42.639 --> 40:44.474
in Palm Springs
for like 900 bucks.

40:45.207 --> 40:46.976
For that?

40:47.010 --> 40:49.178
For Chucky's sister?

40:49.211 --> 40:52.381
Guess creepy isn't cheap.

40:52.414 --> 40:54.083
Do you think Liv is gonna quit
her job at the coffee shop?

40:55.985 --> 40:59.256
If not, we'll lock her in
a room with Lucinda here.

41:01.224 --> 41:03.427
That would be mean.

41:17.037 --> 41:17.037
Mom?

41:17.072 --> 41:18.975
Yeah, in here.

41:20.443 --> 41:22.246
Okay, I wanna talk to
you about something.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.383
Okay. What's up?

41:27.450 --> 41:29.552
Is everything okay?

41:29.584 --> 41:31.954
Yeah.
I'm just...

41:31.988 --> 41:34.524
I'm just tired and I'm
just trying to catch up.

41:37.961 --> 41:39.112
Mom...

41:39.147 --> 41:40.263
I'm fine.

41:40.296 --> 41:44.101
I've had 18 years to know when you
are lying to protect me from something.

41:51.173 --> 41:52.342
Okay.

41:56.079 --> 41:57.447
It's no secret the
cafe has been slow

41:58.381 --> 41:59.983
for quite a while.

42:00.015 --> 42:01.584
I thought it would
pick up over summer,

42:02.751 --> 42:03.986
but it hasn't.

42:06.122 --> 42:07.491
So how bad is it?

42:11.660 --> 42:12.561
We have a month.

42:14.463 --> 42:15.364
Maybe two.

42:18.300 --> 42:19.568
But it's not your problem.

42:19.602 --> 42:20.938
Of course it is.

42:22.671 --> 42:25.108
We are family. We're gonna
get through this together.

42:28.043 --> 42:29.412
You're so grown up.

42:31.046 --> 42:32.282
When did that happen?

42:33.316 --> 42:35.052
I don't know.

42:36.651 --> 42:38.153
Trying to figure out
that one myself.

42:42.224 --> 42:43.492
Anyway that's not
why you came in here.

42:43.526 --> 42:44.728
What did you
wanna talk about?

42:47.030 --> 42:49.131
Nothing.

42:49.164 --> 42:51.668
It just... I'm going to
the beach with the girls.

42:51.700 --> 42:53.702
Okay. Great.

42:53.735 --> 42:55.538
Have fun, honey.
Don't worry about this.

43:05.381 --> 43:06.616
Hey, mom?

43:06.648 --> 43:07.450
Yeah?

43:08.684 --> 43:10.053
I love you.

43:13.055 --> 43:15.057
I love you, too.

43:48.291 --> 43:49.760
<i>Slamming doors</i>

43:50.726 --> 43:52.662
<i>No windows</i>

43:52.695 --> 43:54.831
<i>Feeling stuck</i>

43:54.863 --> 43:57.233
<i>Believing is too hard</i>

43:57.265 --> 43:59.334
<i>High hopes</i>

43:59.367 --> 44:00.736
<i>Short rainbows</i>

44:01.637 --> 44:03.740
<i>Out of luck</i>

44:03.773 --> 44:07.177
<i>And there's no shooting star
when you need one</i>

44:07.209 --> 44:09.211
<i>Don't need a reason</i>

44:09.244 --> 44:12.048
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

44:13.648 --> 44:15.651
<i>Wake up</i>

44:15.684 --> 44:18.387
<i>Don't go chasing dreams</i>

44:18.421 --> 44:20.189
<i>Your hands are tied again</i>

44:20.222 --> 44:21.757
<i>You'll fly without wings</i>

44:22.325 --> 44:24.627
<i>Enough</i>

44:24.660 --> 44:26.830
<i>No more make believe</i>

44:26.863 --> 44:30.332
<i>Back to the world
You're gonna forget, you see</i>

44:30.365 --> 44:34.103
<i>You are powerless</i>

44:34.137 --> 44:39.743
<i>You are powerless</i>

44:45.213 --> 44:46.682
<i>Hey</i>

44:48.517 --> 44:50.220
<i>Don't say</i>

44:52.889 --> 44:54.756
<i>No more</i>

44:54.789 --> 45:00.229
<i>Giving up the fight
before the war</i>

45:02.564 --> 45:03.900
<i>Hey</i>

45:03.932 --> 45:06.268
<i>Wake up</i>

45:06.302 --> 45:08.371
<i>Don't go chasing dreams</i>

45:08.403 --> 45:10.506
<i>Your hands are tied again</i>

45:10.539 --> 45:12.474
<i>You'll fly without wings</i>

45:12.508 --> 45:14.677
<i>Enough</i>

45:14.709 --> 45:17.347
<i>No more make believe</i>

45:17.380 --> 45:20.316
<i>Back to the world
You're gonna forget, you see</i>

45:20.349 --> 45:24.287
<i>You are powerless</i>

45:24.320 --> 45:29.126
<i>You are powerless</i>

45:30.459 --> 45:32.329
<i>Hey, hey</i>

45:35.298 --> 45:36.765
<i>Powerless</i>

45:39.769 --> 45:43.372
<i>How does it feel to be so</i>

45:43.405 --> 45:45.842
<i>I am powerless</i>

45:53.215 --> 45:54.950
My gosh!

45:54.983 --> 45:56.652
He is so cute!

45:57.519 --> 45:58.554
Well?

45:58.588 --> 46:00.423
Is he coming?

46:00.456 --> 46:01.791
I dunno. He said
he was gonna try.

46:01.823 --> 46:03.693
So, we'll see.

46:03.726 --> 46:05.928
Why, I do believe
young Chloe is in love!

46:05.961 --> 46:07.863
My goodness!
Please!

46:07.896 --> 46:10.732
We just met,
you know?

46:10.765 --> 46:15.271
Okay. Let's just say
I'm in like,

46:15.303 --> 46:19.876
with very, very
strong potential.

46:19.909 --> 46:23.780
What if he looks super weird
when he's not painted silver?

46:23.813 --> 46:25.948
Well, then I guess we'll
just have to repaint him.

46:32.921 --> 46:34.756
Hey, Sydney,

46:34.789 --> 46:36.692
I see some, quality
prospects over there.

46:37.693 --> 46:39.495
Yeah.

46:39.528 --> 46:40.863
And some nasty leftovers.

46:40.896 --> 46:42.532
Is that RJ?

46:42.564 --> 46:43.733
Doesn't matter.

46:43.765 --> 46:45.735
I'm here to enjoy the beach
with my girls and that's that.

46:45.767 --> 46:46.769
That's right.

46:55.043 --> 46:57.279
Okay!

46:57.313 --> 46:59.581
Is it me or did I just
get monumentally blown off?

46:59.615 --> 47:00.883
Yeah. What's
going on?

47:01.851 --> 47:03.417
-What's up ladies?
-Hey!

47:03.452 --> 47:04.553
How did it go with your mom?

47:04.586 --> 47:05.954
Yeah...

47:05.988 --> 47:07.056
I decided to take a break

47:07.088 --> 47:11.260
from the whole list thing
and go play with boys.

47:11.293 --> 47:12.561
You should try it.

47:13.595 --> 47:14.597
What?

47:15.564 --> 47:16.733
What was that
about?

47:16.765 --> 47:17.733
I have no idea.

47:21.604 --> 47:23.573
How are you?

47:28.477 --> 47:29.746
Keep an eye
on crazy pants.

47:29.778 --> 47:30.880
I'll be
right back.

47:30.912 --> 47:32.282
You got it.

47:34.816 --> 47:36.552
You do realize these
waters are breeding grounds

47:36.584 --> 47:37.653
for great white sharks.

47:39.322 --> 47:40.523
Chloe told me that.

47:40.555 --> 47:41.557
Well, maybe Chloe
shouldn't surf.

47:43.659 --> 47:45.394
I was just about to head
out. You need something?

47:46.762 --> 47:48.698
A little eye contact
would be nice.

47:52.535 --> 47:56.406
Am I crazy, or are things
suddenly weird between us?

47:56.439 --> 47:57.674
Well, you're not crazy.

47:57.706 --> 47:59.474
Well, what's going on?

47:59.508 --> 48:00.944
I don't know, Syd. Why don't
you ask Austin that question?

48:01.910 --> 48:02.979
Translation, please?

48:03.845 --> 48:05.081
I gave Austin your demo.

48:05.113 --> 48:06.215
That was you?

48:06.249 --> 48:08.084
And you know what, I wouldn't
have, if I would've known

48:08.117 --> 48:10.486
all this stuff was gonna
go on between you two.

48:10.519 --> 48:12.722
Well, why didn't
you tell me?

48:12.755 --> 48:15.390
And what exactly do you think is
happening between me and Austin?

48:15.423 --> 48:16.925
Don't give me that,
Sydney. I know what I saw.

48:18.693 --> 48:21.697
RJ, you're crazy!

48:21.731 --> 48:22.732
Stay right here.

48:23.832 --> 48:25.535
Syd... Sydney!

48:27.436 --> 48:28.638
Liv!

48:28.671 --> 48:30.640
What're you doing?

48:30.673 --> 48:33.642
I'm hooking up with a hot guy.

48:33.675 --> 48:36.778
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

48:36.811 --> 48:37.846
Come on.
We need to talk.

48:37.880 --> 48:39.082
Right, right,

48:39.115 --> 48:41.017
because that's your
favorite thing to do.

48:41.050 --> 48:43.919
We braid each others hair,
and we make lists.

48:43.952 --> 48:45.554
And we talk about goals,

48:45.588 --> 48:48.425
and dreams and how
wonderful life's gonna be.

48:49.057 --> 48:50.726
Guess what?

48:50.760 --> 48:52.562
It's not always that easy.

48:52.595 --> 48:54.030
Did something happen?

48:54.063 --> 48:55.999
Yeah, I finally woke up!

48:57.666 --> 48:58.901
Come on, RJ.
Let's go.

48:59.901 --> 49:01.371
So, that's the answer.

49:02.537 --> 49:03.773
Take this jerk back?

49:03.805 --> 49:05.441
And let him treat
you like trash

49:05.474 --> 49:06.876
so you'll feel good
about yourself?

49:07.642 --> 49:09.813
Screw you, Syd.

49:10.546 --> 49:12.814
This is who I am.

49:12.847 --> 49:15.717
Do you even realize
how lucky you are?

49:15.751 --> 49:17.720
I'm not going
to college.

49:17.753 --> 49:20.555
I don't have a record label
giving me an offer.

49:20.588 --> 49:22.090
This is as good as it
gets for me!

49:22.124 --> 49:23.793
You honestly think
my life's that easy?

49:23.825 --> 49:24.860
Yes, your life
is that easy!

49:24.894 --> 49:27.397
And I swear, if you play
that "My mom died" card,

49:27.430 --> 49:28.462
-that was five years ago...
-Liv!

49:28.497 --> 49:29.532
Don't use that!

49:29.564 --> 49:31.434
Don't you dare!

49:31.467 --> 49:34.669
You honestly think that
I still don't miss her?

49:34.702 --> 49:36.939
That I wouldn't give anything
just to talk to her one more time?

49:38.139 --> 49:39.340
Because maybe then
she could tell me why

49:39.374 --> 49:41.510
everything in my life feels
like its suddenly falling apart.

49:41.543 --> 49:42.544
Sydney...

49:44.146 --> 49:47.450
You act like you have
it all figured out, Liv,

49:47.483 --> 49:49.052
but you're just
as afraid as I am.

49:50.753 --> 49:51.821
At least I'm not a liar.

49:53.488 --> 49:55.925
I found the acceptance letter
to Juilliard in your room.

49:57.726 --> 49:58.961
She applied and got in.

49:58.994 --> 50:00.095
She's known
this entire time.

50:00.128 --> 50:01.463
You got in?

50:01.796 --> 50:02.798
Wait...

50:04.467 --> 50:05.601
You knew?

50:05.633 --> 50:07.836
Only that she applied.

50:12.740 --> 50:15.577
You guys are supposed
to be my best friends.

50:15.610 --> 50:16.612
We are.

50:18.180 --> 50:19.149
Sydney...

50:23.686 --> 50:25.521
Have a nice life,
princess.

50:39.501 --> 50:40.802
Syd, stop, okay?
Come on.

50:40.836 --> 50:41.871
Leave me alone, Liam.

50:41.903 --> 50:43.606
Look, I'm sorry
about what I said.

50:43.639 --> 50:45.508
The whole Austin thing. I
probably overreacted a little bit.

50:45.541 --> 50:47.209
You think?

50:47.242 --> 50:49.478
Randomly accusing me of hooking up
with Austin, I mean, what is that?

50:49.512 --> 50:50.912
I wasn't accusing
you of anything...

50:50.945 --> 50:52.814
And while we're
on the subject,

50:52.847 --> 50:54.817
why are you acting like a
jealous boyfriend all of a sudden?

51:01.222 --> 51:02.724
I can't believe
you just said that.

51:05.827 --> 51:07.729
No. You know what?

51:07.762 --> 51:08.997
Don't flatter yourself, Syd.

51:15.236 --> 51:18.206
<i>It gets unbearable</i>

51:18.240 --> 51:21.209
<i>A million needles</i>

51:21.242 --> 51:23.512
<i>Piercing my heart
like a poison</i>

51:23.546 --> 51:27.183
<i>And I start feeling numb
but I can't let go,</i>

51:27.215 --> 51:30.218
<i>How did we lose our way?</i>

51:30.251 --> 51:33.154
<i>A broken record plays</i>

51:33.188 --> 51:36.057
<i>Round in my head
but it's all crumbling</i>

51:36.090 --> 51:39.261
<i>And our song's never
ever gonna be the same</i>

51:39.294 --> 51:40.695
<i>I'm getting good at</i>

51:40.729 --> 51:42.598
<i>Messing up long enough</i>

51:42.631 --> 51:45.201
<i>To keep myself from
feeling love, out of luck</i>

51:45.233 --> 51:46.701
<i>My hands are tied up</i>

51:46.735 --> 51:48.169
<i>Hand cuffed, guilty of</i>

51:48.202 --> 51:50.139
<i>Words that run away</i>

51:50.171 --> 51:54.943
<i>When every smile feels
impossible</i>

51:54.977 --> 51:56.012
<i>Impostsible</i>

51:56.044 --> 52:00.916
<i>And every tear you cry
is unstoppable</i>

52:00.950 --> 52:02.252
<i>Unstoppable</i>

52:03.218 --> 52:06.188
<i>No more clouds, stars</i>

52:06.220 --> 52:08.291
<i>It can be so hard to choose</i>

52:08.323 --> 52:11.827
<i>When every heartbeat, baby</i>

52:11.860 --> 52:13.863
<i>Is ours to lose</i>

52:15.264 --> 52:18.066
<i>Why does it hurt so much?</i>

52:18.099 --> 52:21.202
<i>Sun's turning into rest</i>

52:21.235 --> 52:24.773
<i>Burned in the fire
And we're not going away</i>

52:24.807 --> 52:27.243
<i>But I can't untangle us</i>

52:27.276 --> 52:30.212
<i>I'm getting good at
messing up long enough</i>

52:30.244 --> 52:33.315
<i>To keep myself from
feeling love, out of luck</i>

52:33.349 --> 52:36.218
<i>My hands are tied up
Handcuffed, guilty of</i>

52:36.251 --> 52:38.254
<i>Words that run away</i>

52:38.287 --> 52:42.992
<i>When every smile
feels impossible</i>

52:43.025 --> 52:44.327
<i>Impossible</i>

52:44.360 --> 52:48.997
<i>And every tear you cry
is unstoppable</i>

52:49.030 --> 52:50.233
<i>Unstoppable</i>

52:51.133 --> 52:54.203
<i>No more clouds, stars</i>

52:54.235 --> 52:56.271
<i>It can be so hard to choose</i>

52:56.305 --> 52:59.909
<i>When every heartbeat, baby</i>

52:59.941 --> 53:02.144
<i>Is ours to lose</i>

53:17.959 --> 53:21.030
<i>Every one of these is
different all by themselves.</i>

53:21.063 --> 53:22.231
But when you
put them together...

53:36.077 --> 53:37.012
They create
something beautiful.

53:38.012 --> 53:39.781
But how do you
know which ones?

53:39.814 --> 53:41.117
You listen.

53:41.916 --> 53:43.119
But not with this,

53:43.751 --> 53:45.654
with this.

53:45.688 --> 53:46.588
Your boob?

53:46.622 --> 53:50.992
Your heart, goober,
not your boob.

53:51.026 --> 53:52.328
You wanna give
it a shot?

53:53.061 --> 53:54.363
Come on, try it.

53:54.997 --> 53:57.433
Okay.

54:02.336 --> 54:04.039
It's okay.
It's all right. Here.

54:04.740 --> 54:05.875
Let's try this.

54:05.907 --> 54:07.040
-Now close your eyes.
-But...

54:07.075 --> 54:08.077
Trust yourself.

54:09.378 --> 54:10.178
Okay.

54:30.064 --> 54:32.101
You got it.
Now keep playing.

55:30.459 --> 55:31.461
Hey!

55:33.227 --> 55:34.130
Is everything
all right?

55:35.963 --> 55:37.733
Yeah. Fine.

55:40.302 --> 55:42.037
Look what I found.

55:48.142 --> 55:50.345
Why didn't you
say something?

55:50.378 --> 55:53.248
Because it doesn't make
any sense right now!

55:53.282 --> 55:55.284
Because we're
struggling...

55:55.316 --> 55:56.885
Anyway, we
can't afford it.

55:56.918 --> 55:58.253
This is an incredible
opportunity.

55:59.454 --> 56:01.323
You got into
Juilliard!

56:01.356 --> 56:03.793
I don't care! I'm not
going to Juilliard...

56:03.825 --> 56:05.160
Hey! Look at me!

56:06.528 --> 56:08.363
You are the most
amazing daughter

56:08.396 --> 56:10.398
any mom could
ever want.

56:10.432 --> 56:12.869
But it's not your job
to take care of me.

56:13.468 --> 56:15.104
All right?

56:15.137 --> 56:16.438
I want this for you.

56:16.470 --> 56:17.840
I want you to go.

56:17.872 --> 56:20.342
I want you to dance
and see the world,

56:20.374 --> 56:22.410
and do everything
you ever dreamed of.

56:23.311 --> 56:24.546
But the shop...

56:24.579 --> 56:26.314
I would sell that shop

56:26.347 --> 56:28.884
a hundred times if I could
give you a better life.

56:30.619 --> 56:32.789
Nothing else matters to me.

56:35.090 --> 56:36.092
Honey...

56:37.992 --> 56:39.828
You deserve this.

56:41.329 --> 56:43.465
And that's why we're
gonna figure it out.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.302
God.

56:49.371 --> 56:51.173
I'm so proud of you.

56:52.907 --> 56:54.043
I love you.

56:54.075 --> 56:55.443
I love you too, mom.

57:27.075 --> 57:28.077
Hey.

57:29.211 --> 57:30.979
Hey.

57:31.012 --> 57:33.248
I'm kind of surprised
you picked up.

57:33.282 --> 57:34.917
I'm kind of surprised
you called.

57:35.550 --> 57:38.220
Look, Syd, I...

57:38.253 --> 57:41.090
I'm sorry. This all got blown away
out of proportion, I think, and we...

59:47.782 --> 59:48.583
Hey.

59:50.452 --> 59:51.454
Hey.

59:52.688 --> 59:55.090
I don't know where you're
headed, but I can come back...

59:55.122 --> 59:57.193
No, actually, I was on
my way to your place.

59:59.258 --> 59:59.258
I'm really...

59:59.293 --> 01:00:01.362
I didn't mean to...

01:00:01.396 --> 01:00:02.497
You go ahead.

01:00:05.434 --> 01:00:07.403
I'm sorry, Chlo.

01:00:07.436 --> 01:00:09.537
I said a lot of horrible
things yesterday,

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.706
and I didn't
mean them.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:14.810
I was running
at DEFCON 1.

01:00:14.843 --> 01:00:18.681
In a super bad place
and it's not an excuse.

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:23.684
You're my
best friend.

01:00:23.718 --> 01:00:25.121
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

01:00:26.153 --> 01:00:27.155
DEFCON 1?

01:00:28.722 --> 01:00:30.558
I didn't think
you ever listened.

01:00:30.592 --> 01:00:32.427
Of course I listen.

01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:33.796
That's the only way
I get As on tests.

01:00:35.197 --> 01:00:37.432
I'm glad I'm
helpful somehow.

01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:40.535
Anyways, this
belongs to you.

01:00:41.403 --> 01:00:44.606
Thank you!
Thank you.

01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:46.575
Now, I'm gonna
hug you.

01:00:46.608 --> 01:00:48.343
Are you
hugging back?

01:00:48.376 --> 01:00:51.113
That's so awesome!
Okay, now...

01:00:51.146 --> 01:00:52.615
Let's go
find Sydney.

01:00:59.688 --> 01:01:00.555
Hey.

01:01:03.157 --> 01:01:04.259
Hey.

01:01:06.561 --> 01:01:07.696
So...

01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:11.366
I know we already
talked yesterday.

01:01:11.398 --> 01:01:13.535
I just wanted to come
by with a little,

01:01:15.202 --> 01:01:17.538
peace offering,
just in case.

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:17.573
You didn't.

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:18.640
I did.

01:01:19.907 --> 01:01:22.243
Dibs on the red ones.

01:01:22.276 --> 01:01:23.778
Am I really
that predictable?

01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:24.846
Kinda.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.515
You're favorite color has
been red for, like, ever.

01:01:34.322 --> 01:01:36.457
Liam, they're all red.

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.260
Yes they are. I mean,
unless I missed one.

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:42.663
This is literally the sweetest
thing anyone's ever done for me.

01:01:42.697 --> 01:01:43.698
And also the
most random.

01:01:45.566 --> 01:01:46.668
How do you come up
with stuff like this?

01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:49.738
I guess I just
know you, that's all.

01:01:53.175 --> 01:01:54.877
Any word from
Liv or Chlo?

01:01:58.180 --> 01:01:59.248
Liv was right.

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:01.749
No, I refuse to live in a
world where Liv is right.

01:02:03.718 --> 01:02:08.657
Yeah, but I am terrified
of the future and...

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.593
I don't know who
I am anymore.

01:02:12.526 --> 01:02:14.563
I'm kind of
a hot mess.

01:02:17.731 --> 01:02:20.468
That kinda comes with
the territory, though.

01:02:21.468 --> 01:02:23.539
Don't you think?

01:02:23.572 --> 01:02:26.307
I mean, here we are
in this phase of our life

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:27.708
and everyone
expects us to know

01:02:27.742 --> 01:02:29.644
exactly what we're going
to do next, but we don't.

01:02:29.677 --> 01:02:32.213
Yeah, but come on, you've always
known what you wanted to do.

01:02:32.247 --> 01:02:34.550
Please, I'm just
as lost as anybody.

01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:36.619
I turned...
I turned down Caltech.

01:02:37.686 --> 01:02:38.887
I have no idea
what I'm doing,

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:42.224
but you know what, that's exactly
why I wanna take this trip.

01:02:42.256 --> 01:02:45.427
There are 22 million people
our age in this country.

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:46.928
If we're going
through all this stuff,

01:02:46.961 --> 01:02:48.664
they have to be going
through it too, right?

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:50.965
Probably so.

01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:53.267
So, I wanna
talk to them,

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.203
film their stories.

01:02:55.236 --> 01:02:56.438
I don't know.

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:57.905
I just wanna travel
across the country

01:02:57.939 --> 01:02:59.975
with nothing
but my camera

01:03:00.008 --> 01:03:01.776
and just, like,
eat really bad food

01:03:01.809 --> 01:03:03.445
and stay in
sketchy campgrounds.

01:03:03.477 --> 01:03:04.947
Just make this film
and see what happens.

01:03:04.979 --> 01:03:07.315
I like not having
a plan right now.

01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:09.218
I could submit
the film to festivals,

01:03:09.251 --> 01:03:10.852
I could go to
film school, I could...

01:03:12.387 --> 01:03:14.689
Stop rambling.
Sorry.

01:03:15.322 --> 01:03:16.324
I get excited.

01:03:16.358 --> 01:03:18.494
No, it's great.

01:03:19.628 --> 01:03:20.930
I love to hear
you talk about it.

01:03:24.765 --> 01:03:25.767
Syd?

01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:30.639
No matter
what you decide,

01:03:33.642 --> 01:03:35.344
don't let anyone
change you.

01:03:35.943 --> 01:03:37.212
Okay?

01:03:41.316 --> 01:03:43.218
'Cause I already think
you're pretty perfect.

01:03:46.854 --> 01:03:47.655
Thanks.

01:03:57.831 --> 01:04:02.270
<i>Is it me? What's it mean?
Does he know what I'm feeling?</i>

01:04:03.872 --> 01:04:08.410
<i>Is it real? Can he see
my heart on the ceiling?</i>

01:04:08.443 --> 01:04:11.613
<i>'Cause every word is a dare</i>

01:04:11.646 --> 01:04:14.548
<i>Every smile is a sting</i>

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:17.752
<i>Could it be that I care?</i>

01:04:17.785 --> 01:04:22.390
<i>This could change
everything about...</i>

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:23.858
<i>Tonight do I lie?</i>

01:04:23.892 --> 01:04:28.630
<i>Should I say
what I'm thnking?</i>

01:04:28.662 --> 01:04:30.365
<i>Tongue is tied
to the sky</i>

01:04:30.398 --> 01:04:33.001
<i>My heart is sinking</i>

01:04:33.034 --> 01:04:36.070
<i>'Cause you're
the one that I want</i>

01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:39.441
<i>You're the one
that I need</i>

01:04:39.474 --> 01:04:42.077
<i>Won't know
how to move on.</i>

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.512
<i>If we don't do anything</i>

01:04:44.546 --> 01:04:48.617
<i>About tonight</i>

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:54.789
<i>About tonight</i>

01:04:54.822 --> 01:04:59.694
<i>About tonight</i>

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:05.566
<i>Put our hearts on the line
There's no going back</i>

01:05:05.599 --> 01:05:09.804
<i>Walk away with the words
If we never ask</i>

01:05:09.838 --> 01:05:12.407
<i>I hope I'm right</i>

01:05:12.439 --> 01:05:15.778
<i>About tonight</i>

01:05:17.778 --> 01:05:19.447
<i>With my breath
on the edge</i>

01:05:19.481 --> 01:05:22.551
<i>Will you be there
to catch me?</i>

01:05:23.751 --> 01:05:25.720
<i>Take a step
Cross the bridge</i>

01:05:25.753 --> 01:05:28.489
<i>Jump in to the deep</i>

01:05:28.523 --> 01:05:31.727
<i>'Cause you're the one
that I want</i>

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:34.428
<i>My everything</i>

01:05:34.461 --> 01:05:37.733
<i>I won't know
how to move on</i>

01:05:37.765 --> 01:05:40.001
<i>If we don't do anything</i>

01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:43.771
<i>About tonight</i>

01:05:43.805 --> 01:05:49.977
<i>About tonight</i>

01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:54.717
<i>About tonight</i>

01:05:57.852 --> 01:06:00.822
<i>Put our hearts on the line
There's no going back</i>

01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:05.526
<i>Walk away with the words
if we never ask</i>

01:06:05.559 --> 01:06:11.032
<i>I hope I'm right
about tonight</i>

01:06:13.767 --> 01:06:16.771
<i>I hope we're right</i>

01:06:18.206 --> 01:06:20.108
<i>I hope I'm right</i>

01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:21.409
<i>Yeah</i>

01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:24.546
<i>About tonight</i>

01:06:26.146 --> 01:06:28.049
Syd, your
phone's ringing.

01:06:29.082 --> 01:06:31.153
I...

01:06:31.186 --> 01:06:32.888
I'd better go get that.

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.869
Okay, thanks.

01:06:47.501 --> 01:06:48.536
Bye.

01:06:50.238 --> 01:06:51.940
Hey, dad.

01:06:51.975 --> 01:06:51.975
Hey.

01:06:53.608 --> 01:06:55.841
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:06:55.876 --> 01:06:59.447
That was Austin.
The record label guy.

01:06:59.481 --> 01:07:02.050
And I know what you
think about the whole...

01:07:02.085 --> 01:07:03.351
Yeah, yeah.

01:07:03.386 --> 01:07:04.653
About that.

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:08.088
I may not have been entirely
honest with you the other night.

01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:08.957
What do you mean?

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:11.726
Well...

01:07:11.758 --> 01:07:15.530
When you asked me what your mom
would've thought of all this...

01:07:15.563 --> 01:07:16.997
I mean,
don't get me wrong,

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:18.833
your education was
very important to her.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:22.036
To me too. But...

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:27.242
She also would've
been as intrigued

01:07:27.275 --> 01:07:30.077
as you are by this whole
record company thing.

01:07:32.012 --> 01:07:33.180
You really think so?

01:07:33.213 --> 01:07:34.849
Yeah.

01:07:34.883 --> 01:07:37.785
So, I want you
to have this.

01:07:37.818 --> 01:07:38.986
That was your mom's
when she was your age.

01:07:41.021 --> 01:07:42.457
Look inside
the front cover.

01:07:48.095 --> 01:07:50.164
"There is a wisdom
in the wave...

01:07:50.197 --> 01:07:52.633
"high-born, beautiful...

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:54.902
"for those who would
but paddle out."

01:07:54.936 --> 01:07:56.238
It was your mom's
favorite quote.

01:07:57.805 --> 01:07:59.741
Man, she
loved the beach.

01:08:01.175 --> 01:08:04.044
Believe it or not, that's
actually where we met.

01:08:04.077 --> 01:08:06.148
I used to be, quite the
surfer back in my day.

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:09.651
You, a surfer?

01:08:09.684 --> 01:08:11.586
Your dad is, like,
full of mysteries.

01:08:13.787 --> 01:08:15.956
But she used to
always say that

01:08:15.990 --> 01:08:18.727
there were people that spent their
entire lives just sitting on the beach.

01:08:19.693 --> 01:08:21.830
Staring out at
the ocean,

01:08:21.862 --> 01:08:23.798
just afraid to paddle
out and discover

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:26.033
who they were meant
to be, for themselves.

01:08:26.067 --> 01:08:27.969
But your mom?

01:08:28.001 --> 01:08:29.638
She wasn't afraid
of anything.

01:08:30.837 --> 01:08:32.073
And I love that
about her.

01:08:34.008 --> 01:08:35.143
And I love that
about you.

01:08:38.179 --> 01:08:40.649
I just wish I could
remember that part of her.

01:08:41.316 --> 01:08:42.518
You can.

01:08:43.585 --> 01:08:45.319
Just look
in the mirror,

01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:47.956
because that spirit
is inside you, too.

01:08:49.691 --> 01:08:53.795
I think that you just
need to follow your heart.

01:08:53.827 --> 01:08:54.996
'Cause that's what
she would've done.

01:08:58.066 --> 01:08:59.551
Thanks, dad.

01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:01.036
I love you Syd.

01:09:01.068 --> 01:09:04.106
And, no matter what you
decide, I will support you.

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.642
I know.

01:09:07.674 --> 01:09:10.109
You always have.

01:09:10.143 --> 01:09:11.645
And that's what makes
you such a great dad.

01:09:12.714 --> 01:09:15.716
Greatest dad,
like, ever.

01:09:15.750 --> 01:09:18.219
Like, they should write a
book on my great dadness.

01:09:18.251 --> 01:09:20.354
Okay, don't push it.

01:09:20.388 --> 01:09:22.057
Okay, well, I don't
know about you,

01:09:22.089 --> 01:09:23.657
but all this bonding
is making me hungry.

01:09:23.691 --> 01:09:25.894
You want to,
get something to eat?

01:09:25.926 --> 01:09:27.362
Yeah, sounds great.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.033
But there's something
I need to take care of first.

01:09:34.801 --> 01:09:35.804
What's that?

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:37.738
Just...

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:40.341
Tired of sitting
on the beach.

01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:44.979
Thanks, dad.

01:09:45.013 --> 01:09:46.148
Hey.

01:09:47.415 --> 01:09:48.984
Go hit those waves, honey.

01:09:51.318 --> 01:09:53.788
Hopefully, catch one that...

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:56.858
Woo, sends you to college.

01:09:59.093 --> 01:10:00.629
Why are you freaking
out so much?

01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:01.762
Because she can't
sign with Austin.

01:10:01.796 --> 01:10:04.232
He wants to turn her into
some kind of label robot.

01:10:04.264 --> 01:10:07.102
Call her! It's a record deal,
not a human sacrifice!

01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:09.370
But she's dreamed about going
to Berkeley since we were kids.

01:10:09.403 --> 01:10:11.673
She has to go to Boston
for her own music!

01:10:11.705 --> 01:10:12.940
Whoa!

01:10:13.407 --> 01:10:14.942
Okay.

01:10:14.976 --> 01:10:16.143
That's a new feeling.

01:10:16.177 --> 01:10:17.344
Too scared to throw up.

01:10:17.378 --> 01:10:19.414
Please.

01:10:19.446 --> 01:10:21.081
You were safe the entire time.

01:10:21.115 --> 01:10:22.717
Okay, Danica.

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.886
You definitely need to
pull back on the crazy reins.

01:10:24.919 --> 01:10:27.122
What's the problem?
A little too wild for you?

01:10:30.355 --> 01:10:32.658
-Hello!
-No! No, no, no way!

01:10:32.693 --> 01:10:34.396
Stop freaking out.
We gotta get inside!

01:10:34.429 --> 01:10:35.664
We have to get in there!

01:10:35.696 --> 01:10:36.931
There's probably another door.

01:10:39.933 --> 01:10:41.101
What're you two doing here?

01:10:41.134 --> 01:10:42.903
We're too late.

01:10:42.937 --> 01:10:44.206
We came to stop you.

01:10:45.872 --> 01:10:47.075
Because you both
care so much?

01:10:47.942 --> 01:10:49.978
I'm sorry, Syd.

01:10:50.010 --> 01:10:51.845
I said horrible things!

01:10:51.879 --> 01:10:53.314
Really?

01:10:53.347 --> 01:10:55.183
Yeah, I, I'm sorry I lied.

01:10:55.215 --> 01:10:59.354
I was jealous and scared
and I feel horrible

01:10:59.387 --> 01:11:00.522
that you've been doing
this all on your own,

01:11:00.554 --> 01:11:03.290
and I'm too wrapped up in my
own stupid drama to notice.

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:06.827
You know...

01:11:08.228 --> 01:11:10.898
You're not as mean
as you think you are.

01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:13.168
Actually, she can
be pretty mean.

01:11:13.468 --> 01:11:14.635
Really?

01:11:14.669 --> 01:11:16.705
As long as we're being
honest and everything.

01:11:17.738 --> 01:11:20.008
But you were right.

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.009
Yeah your delivery
sucked but...

01:11:24.112 --> 01:11:26.448
I have been hiding
for too long and...

01:11:28.014 --> 01:11:29.383
I don't wanna
lose you guys.

01:11:29.416 --> 01:11:31.285
We are so messed up.
Can we just hug now?

01:11:31.318 --> 01:11:33.754
Okay.

01:11:35.889 --> 01:11:37.459
So, were
we too late?

01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:38.826
You know what, it doesn't
matter. Whatever you...

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.259
-I told him no.
-Really?

01:11:40.294 --> 01:11:42.363
You did what?

01:11:42.396 --> 01:11:46.300
Yeah, I'm sticking to
the whole Boston plan.

01:11:46.334 --> 01:11:49.104
I figure, I need to
concentrate on my music and

01:11:49.137 --> 01:11:51.106
discover who I am again.

01:11:51.138 --> 01:11:52.139
Are you sure you're okay?

01:11:53.907 --> 01:11:56.143
Yeah, I'm great actually.

01:11:58.345 --> 01:11:59.147
By the way...

01:12:00.548 --> 01:12:02.015
For you.

01:12:02.049 --> 01:12:03.067
You saved it.

01:12:03.102 --> 01:12:04.085
Of course I did.

01:12:04.117 --> 01:12:06.987
All right, so,
who's ready to party?

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:09.456
The rager is still on?

01:12:09.490 --> 01:12:11.291
Absolutely.

01:12:11.325 --> 01:12:14.394
Broom's in my house right
now getting everything ready.

01:12:14.428 --> 01:12:16.497
I know this sounds,
like, premature,

01:12:16.531 --> 01:12:18.500
but I think I'm gonna
marry him someday.

01:12:18.532 --> 01:12:20.933
-I knew you were gonna say that!
-My God.

01:12:20.968 --> 01:12:23.037
Mackin' on robot boy!

01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:25.039
I think we should
go with you, though,

01:12:25.071 --> 01:12:26.807
because I'm not getting
in the car with her...

01:12:26.808 --> 01:12:28.175
-What?
-...ever again.

01:12:28.209 --> 01:12:29.510
As if you're a better driver.

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:29.961
That's not...

01:12:29.996 --> 01:12:30.412
Fine, let's go!

01:12:44.157 --> 01:12:46.126
Hey, hey girls,
how're you doin'? Okay.

01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.295
Hey guys.

01:12:47.327 --> 01:12:48.112
Great party!

01:12:48.147 --> 01:12:48.897
Thank you!

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:50.765
Got cheese here!

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:50.800
Yeah!

01:12:52.866 --> 01:12:55.469
Chloe, look at you
and your rager.

01:12:55.503 --> 01:12:58.206
I feel like a host,
you know, it's going well.

01:12:58.238 --> 01:12:59.473
No one's drunk.
It's going good.

01:12:59.506 --> 01:13:00.808
I'm really happy.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:01.125
See?

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:01.442
Hey!

01:13:03.143 --> 01:13:04.344
Hey!

01:13:06.313 --> 01:13:07.881
I'm on the roof!

01:13:09.217 --> 01:13:10.852
Chlo...

01:13:10.884 --> 01:13:12.052
Listen listen.

01:13:12.085 --> 01:13:14.289
I will now run
across the roof,

01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:18.860
jump from one tier
to the next tier,

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:20.895
and then
double backflip

01:13:20.928 --> 01:13:22.964
on to the ground!

01:13:22.996 --> 01:13:24.097
Whoo!

01:13:26.334 --> 01:13:29.170
He's gonna fall!
He's gonna fall and die

01:13:29.202 --> 01:13:30.437
and you're gonna have
a dead guy in your yard.

01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:32.005
No, no, no. You
don't know Broom.

01:13:32.039 --> 01:13:33.340
He can do this,
he's a pro.

01:13:33.374 --> 01:13:35.076
RoboCopping
in music videos

01:13:35.108 --> 01:13:37.144
does not make
him a pro!

01:13:37.178 --> 01:13:39.280
So, Chlo finally
meets a nice guy

01:13:39.312 --> 01:13:40.981
and he thinks he's
Johnny Knoxville.

01:13:42.482 --> 01:13:44.418
Whoo! Yes!

01:13:44.451 --> 01:13:46.486
Yeah, give me
something!

01:13:46.519 --> 01:13:49.557
And now,
for my big finale.

01:13:49.589 --> 01:13:51.191
Whoa, whoa!

01:13:53.326 --> 01:13:55.463
Yeow! That...

01:14:00.968 --> 01:14:02.170
Stunt man!

01:14:07.107 --> 01:14:09.409
Broom! Broom! Broom!

01:14:09.442 --> 01:14:11.144
Yeah!

01:14:11.178 --> 01:14:13.046
She's crazy for him.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.116
Which reminds me,
aren't you supposed to...

01:14:15.148 --> 01:14:16.416
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:19.487
I think the hook up bus
has left the station.

01:14:19.519 --> 01:14:22.423
Besides, I got the main
thing off my list so,

01:14:22.424 --> 01:14:24.358
-I'm good.
-No way, you still have...

01:14:25.293 --> 01:14:26.928
Six hours?

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.562
I'm not giving up
on your hook up.

01:14:28.595 --> 01:14:31.366
I'm gonna go grab some food.

01:14:31.367 --> 01:14:33.901
-You good?
-I guess, I'll take a refill.

01:14:33.934 --> 01:14:34.936
Yeah.

01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.609
This is awkward.

01:14:49.383 --> 01:14:50.550
Hey!

01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:53.021
<i>Hey, what's going
on? Where are you?</i>

01:14:53.054 --> 01:14:54.923
Party at
Chloe's house.

01:14:54.955 --> 01:14:56.556
You wouldn't believe how
many people showed up.

01:14:56.589 --> 01:14:58.224
Where are you?

01:14:58.259 --> 01:15:00.962
<i>I'm at home watching Doctor
Who, 'cause I'm really cool.</i>

01:15:02.396 --> 01:15:04.564
Thanks for the
invitation by the way.

01:15:04.598 --> 01:15:07.635
Honestly, I thought it
was gonna be canceled.

01:15:07.668 --> 01:15:09.938
Well, it's okay because
Chloe told me about it.

01:15:14.607 --> 01:15:15.610
Hey.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.048
Can we talk
for a sec?

01:15:25.286 --> 01:15:27.355
We were already done.
You went back to my mom's...

01:15:27.388 --> 01:15:30.058
Wait, wait, hey, hey, hey!
Calm down, this is a party.

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.059
You know what, this doesn't
concern you, bro, so just back off.

01:15:32.093 --> 01:15:33.228
Dude, you don't
have to touch me.

01:15:34.428 --> 01:15:35.429
Stop it!

01:15:35.463 --> 01:15:37.999
What? This is a party.
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:15:38.031 --> 01:15:39.132
It's done!

01:15:39.165 --> 01:15:40.434
We're not done until
I say we're done.

01:15:40.468 --> 01:15:41.501
Come on, man,
don't touch her.

01:15:41.535 --> 01:15:42.704
What's the
matter with you?

01:15:42.737 --> 01:15:43.538
You okay?

01:15:45.039 --> 01:15:46.273
What're you doing?

01:15:51.443 --> 01:15:51.443
Are you okay?

01:15:51.478 --> 01:15:53.613
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
Didn't hurt at all.

01:15:53.647 --> 01:15:55.684
Liv, you better get out here
before I start busting stuff up!

01:15:59.487 --> 01:16:01.556
Okay, I really thought that
would work better than it did.

01:16:01.589 --> 01:16:02.390
<i>All right,
that's enough!</i>

01:16:04.191 --> 01:16:06.760
<i>I'm gonna say this
Nice and slow</i>

01:16:06.794 --> 01:16:09.363
<i>In little words
So that you know</i>

01:16:09.397 --> 01:16:12.332
<i>I don't ever wanna see you</i>

01:16:12.366 --> 01:16:15.103
<i>And I wouldn't wanna be you</i>

01:16:15.135 --> 01:16:17.705
<i>You used to
Give me butterflies</i>

01:16:17.737 --> 01:16:20.508
<i>And now it feels like
They all died</i>

01:16:20.540 --> 01:16:23.244
<i>I'm all out of tears for you</i>

01:16:23.277 --> 01:16:26.280
<i>Lookin' for a better view</i>

01:16:26.312 --> 01:16:29.049
<i>I'll break it down
We're breaking up</i>

01:16:29.082 --> 01:16:31.486
<i>Who's laughing now?
I don't give a</i>

01:16:31.518 --> 01:16:34.655
<i>So take a bow
Your time is up</i>

01:16:34.687 --> 01:16:37.157
<i>And don't freak out
'Cause you're about to</i>

01:16:37.191 --> 01:16:41.728
<i>Watch me as I leg</i>

01:16:41.762 --> 01:16:45.767
<i>You don't wanna beg</i>

01:16:45.799 --> 01:16:48.402
<i>This is the part
Where I'm gonna peace out</i>

01:16:48.436 --> 01:16:52.773
<i>You're no good for me</i>

01:16:52.807 --> 01:16:56.611
<i>We're history</i>

01:16:56.643 --> 01:17:00.113
<i>I'm gonna make an X
Out of you now</i>

01:17:00.147 --> 01:17:02.750
<i>Always kept the
Bad boys close</i>

01:17:02.782 --> 01:17:05.385
<i>Always let the good ones go</i>

01:17:05.419 --> 01:17:07.822
<i>Didnt know what I deserved</i>

01:17:07.854 --> 01:17:10.625
<i>Thank you for that
Lesson learned</i>

01:17:10.657 --> 01:17:13.561
<i>I'll break it down
We're breaking up</i>

01:17:13.594 --> 01:17:16.364
<i>Who's laughing now?
I don't give a</i>

01:17:16.397 --> 01:17:19.133
<i>So take a bow
Your time is up</i>

01:17:19.165 --> 01:17:21.768
<i>And don't freak out
'Cause you're about to</i>

01:17:21.802 --> 01:17:26.339
<i>Watch me as I leg</i>

01:17:26.372 --> 01:17:30.277
<i>You don't wanna beg</i>

01:17:30.311 --> 01:17:33.214
<i>This is the part
Where I'm gonna peace out</i>

01:17:33.246 --> 01:17:37.284
<i>You're no good for me</i>

01:17:37.317 --> 01:17:41.421
<i>We're history</i>

01:17:41.455 --> 01:17:44.626
<i>I'm gonna make an X
Out of you now</i>

01:17:47.228 --> 01:17:50.498
<i>I'm gonna make an X
Out of you now</i>

01:17:55.201 --> 01:17:56.137
You're insane.

01:18:02.910 --> 01:18:06.180
I'm going to give everyone
approximately five seconds

01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:07.715
to clear out of my house.

01:18:11.485 --> 01:18:13.220
Do I look like I'm joking?

01:18:13.254 --> 01:18:15.289
I will end all of you!

01:18:15.321 --> 01:18:18.425
Move! Move! Move!

01:18:31.539 --> 01:18:33.241
Maybe we should poke
her with something.

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.374
-Or use her Taser.
-Liv...

01:18:35.409 --> 01:18:36.544
It's just a thought.

01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:39.680
It's all over.

01:18:40.848 --> 01:18:43.318
No college, no New York.

01:18:44.951 --> 01:18:47.387
They are literally going
to choke the life out of me.

01:18:49.589 --> 01:18:51.226
Well, that's dark.

01:18:53.826 --> 01:18:54.829
Hey...

01:18:56.563 --> 01:18:57.731
Chloe, look.

01:19:00.733 --> 01:19:02.937
Didn't you say this
was your mom's favorite?

01:19:02.969 --> 01:19:04.438
It looks like
she's okay.

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:08.843
Yeah.

01:19:10.311 --> 01:19:11.713
This is the one.

01:19:13.813 --> 01:19:15.549
My mom loves her
more than anything.

01:19:16.784 --> 01:19:19.353
More than me, in fact.

01:19:20.754 --> 01:19:21.923
My whole life
I worked so hard

01:19:21.955 --> 01:19:23.457
to be perfect
for them.

01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:27.861
Perfect grades,
perfect clothes.

01:19:27.894 --> 01:19:30.197
Never a hair
out of place.

01:19:33.366 --> 01:19:35.402
I was just another
piece in their collection.

01:19:37.638 --> 01:19:39.439
Is it crazy that
I hate this thing?

01:19:41.674 --> 01:19:44.678
I mean, I really,
I really hate it.

01:19:55.421 --> 01:19:56.790
Oops.

01:19:58.459 --> 01:19:59.928
I think I broke Lucinda.

01:20:01.495 --> 01:20:03.264
You're not coming
for us next, are you?

01:20:03.296 --> 01:20:05.398
'Cause I'll...

01:20:05.432 --> 01:20:07.268
No, I'm good.

01:20:08.736 --> 01:20:09.737
I'm perfect.

01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.679
Hey.

01:21:24.711 --> 01:21:25.713
Hey.

01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:34.789
Did you really do all of this?

01:21:36.423 --> 01:21:37.858
I was looking through
old photos the other day

01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:40.361
and I realize I've

01:21:40.393 --> 01:21:42.664
practically been taking pictures
of you since the day we met.

01:21:45.765 --> 01:21:47.367
I barely remember
some of these.

01:21:49.870 --> 01:21:52.874
And I've definitely never seen
them all in one place before.

01:21:55.442 --> 01:21:56.544
You hate it.
It's too much.

01:21:57.777 --> 01:21:59.513
No, it's...

01:22:00.147 --> 01:22:01.349
It's perfect.

01:22:03.584 --> 01:22:05.353
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:22:09.756 --> 01:22:10.892
I guess I just...

01:22:13.026 --> 01:22:14.629
Wanted you to see
yourself how I see you.

01:22:15.763 --> 01:22:16.930
How beautiful you are.

01:22:20.433 --> 01:22:21.017
Liam...

01:22:21.052 --> 01:22:21.601
No, don't.

01:22:23.504 --> 01:22:24.671
Will you just
sit down for a sec?

01:22:34.447 --> 01:22:36.450
Okay...

01:22:38.652 --> 01:22:40.888
I know that I'm
probably too late,

01:22:42.423 --> 01:22:43.424
but...

01:22:50.164 --> 01:22:52.532
You're just full of
surprises tonight aren't you?

01:22:52.566 --> 01:22:54.936
I just have to
say this.

01:23:09.916 --> 01:23:13.620
<i>We both know
That you can't stay</i>

01:23:13.653 --> 01:23:15.755
<i>This time</i>

01:23:15.789 --> 01:23:17.657
<i>The world is calling you</i>

01:23:17.691 --> 01:23:22.062
<i>And I won't get in its way</i>

01:23:22.094 --> 01:23:26.199
<i>I could hold you everyday</i>

01:23:26.232 --> 01:23:28.168
<i>Could try</i>

01:23:28.201 --> 01:23:30.204
<i>The shining side of you</i>

01:23:30.237 --> 01:23:34.508
<i>It cannot be contained</i>

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:37.610
<i>Darlin'</i>

01:23:37.643 --> 01:23:40.680
<i>Keep smilin'</i>

01:23:40.714 --> 01:23:46.454
<i>I want you to know</i>

01:23:46.487 --> 01:23:49.557
<i>You've got a heart
To call your own</i>

01:23:49.589 --> 01:23:52.592
<i>With me you'll always
Have a home</i>

01:23:52.625 --> 01:23:58.798
<i>Like the ocean
We are tied</i>

01:23:58.831 --> 01:24:01.869
<i>Lay my jacket
Where you stand</i>

01:24:01.902 --> 01:24:04.939
<i>As long as the sun can</i>

01:24:04.972 --> 01:24:06.874
<i>Love the moon</i>

01:24:06.906 --> 01:24:11.044
<i>From the other side</i>

01:24:11.077 --> 01:24:13.714
<i>I love you, I love you</i>

01:24:13.746 --> 01:24:16.150
<i>Big time</i>

01:24:22.955 --> 01:24:26.860
<i>There's a Polaroid
In my hand</i>

01:24:26.893 --> 01:24:29.062
<i>Of us</i>

01:24:29.095 --> 01:24:32.265
<i>From the time
We almost kissed</i>

01:24:32.299 --> 01:24:35.603
<i>But laughed instead</i>

01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:38.272
<i>Darlin'</i>

01:24:38.304 --> 01:24:40.974
<i>Keep smilin'</i>

01:24:41.008 --> 01:24:47.014
<i>I need you to know</i>

01:24:47.046 --> 01:24:50.150
<i>You've got a heart
To call your own</i>

01:24:50.183 --> 01:24:53.220
<i>With me you'll always
Have a home</i>

01:24:53.253 --> 01:24:59.559
<i>Like the ocean
We are tied</i>

01:24:59.593 --> 01:25:02.830
<i>Lay my jacket
Where you stand</i>

01:25:02.862 --> 01:25:07.534
<i>As long as the sun can
Love the moon</i>

01:25:07.567 --> 01:25:11.838
<i>From the other side</i>

01:25:11.871 --> 01:25:14.307
<i>I love you, I love you</i>

01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:17.777
<i>Big time</i>

01:25:20.746 --> 01:25:23.883
<i>Yeah</i>

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:31.658
<i>Darlin'</i>

01:25:31.692 --> 01:25:34.795
<i>Keep smilin'</i>

01:25:34.827 --> 01:25:40.066
<i>I need you to know</i>

01:25:40.099 --> 01:25:42.969
<i>You've got a heart
To call your own</i>

01:25:43.003 --> 01:25:46.072
<i>With me you'll always
Have a home</i>

01:25:46.106 --> 01:25:48.642
<i>Like the ocean</i>

01:25:48.674 --> 01:25:52.278
<i>We are tied</i>

01:25:52.312 --> 01:25:55.816
<i>So lay my jacket
Where you stand</i>

01:25:55.848 --> 01:25:58.351
<i>As long as the sun can</i>

01:25:58.384 --> 01:26:00.720
<i>Love the moon</i>

01:26:00.754 --> 01:26:03.558
<i>From the other side</i>

01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:07.794
<i>I love you, I love you</i>

01:26:07.827 --> 01:26:12.700
<i>I love you, I love you</i>

01:26:13.232 --> 01:26:17.671
<i>Big time</i>

01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:41.661
I want you to
be happy, Syd.

01:26:43.397 --> 01:26:44.899
That's all I've
ever wanted...

01:27:02.883 --> 01:27:04.184
I love you too, Liam.

01:27:12.858 --> 01:27:14.128
I didn't sign
with Austin.

01:27:16.396 --> 01:27:17.197
What?

01:27:19.299 --> 01:27:20.101
Why?

01:27:23.335 --> 01:27:24.371
Because of you.

01:27:26.772 --> 01:27:29.009
I've been hiding
for so long and

01:27:30.343 --> 01:27:32.979
I've been so afraid of what
the future has in store.

01:27:33.847 --> 01:27:35.049
And I'm still scared.

01:27:35.948 --> 01:27:36.951
A little.

01:27:41.821 --> 01:27:44.057
But now, I'm ready
to take that next step.

01:27:48.094 --> 01:27:49.095
In Boston?

01:28:00.439 --> 01:28:02.777
I'm really
gonna miss you, Syd.

01:28:09.415 --> 01:28:10.851
Me too.

01:28:48.821 --> 01:28:50.456
Well, could've
been worse.

01:28:50.490 --> 01:28:51.492
On what planet?

01:28:54.294 --> 01:28:56.396
I figured I'd
find you guys here.

01:28:56.429 --> 01:28:57.965
Now she
shows up?

01:28:57.997 --> 01:28:59.265
We were up all night, cleaning.

01:28:59.299 --> 01:29:01.869
Where have you been,
little missy?

01:29:01.902 --> 01:29:05.005
Just crossing something
else off my list.

01:29:05.037 --> 01:29:06.874
Shut up! Who?

01:29:06.906 --> 01:29:08.941
Wait! You
and Spielberg?

01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:10.343
Finally!

01:29:10.376 --> 01:29:12.278
How's that
gonna work?

01:29:12.312 --> 01:29:14.148
Well, he's gonna
visit me when he

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.182
saves up enough
money for his trip.

01:29:18.884 --> 01:29:19.887
And...

01:29:20.821 --> 01:29:22.490
For you.

01:29:23.924 --> 01:29:25.058
What's this?

01:29:25.090 --> 01:29:26.093
I don't know.

01:29:27.861 --> 01:29:29.130
It's a plane ticket.

01:29:31.497 --> 01:29:34.902
I see that.
For New York?

01:29:34.934 --> 01:29:36.469
It's in a week. I...

01:29:36.503 --> 01:29:39.106
It's a little soon
to visit, no?

01:29:39.138 --> 01:29:40.306
Maybe not
just a visit.

01:29:40.941 --> 01:29:42.543
Your mom made
some calls

01:29:42.576 --> 01:29:45.179
and guess who's going to
Juilliard this semester?

01:29:47.379 --> 01:29:50.550
Wait, you can't just
spring that on someone.

01:29:50.584 --> 01:29:52.251
I don't have
a place to stay.

01:29:52.285 --> 01:29:53.353
No, you're
living with me

01:29:53.385 --> 01:29:54.554
in the fantastic
apartment

01:29:54.588 --> 01:29:56.322
my parents have
rented for me,

01:29:56.356 --> 01:29:57.523
assuming they don't
sell me into slavery,

01:29:57.557 --> 01:29:59.893
in which case,
it's all yours.

01:30:01.327 --> 01:30:03.129
Is this really
happening?

01:30:04.330 --> 01:30:06.432
We love you, Liv.

01:30:06.465 --> 01:30:08.067
We'd do anything
for you.

01:30:08.602 --> 01:30:10.104
I love you guys.

01:30:14.073 --> 01:30:17.978
So, it's Monday
morning.

01:30:18.010 --> 01:30:19.813
The official start
of the rest of our lives.

01:30:21.881 --> 01:30:23.217
I leave for college
in three hours,

01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:24.885
and I still haven't
finished packing.

01:30:24.918 --> 01:30:27.019
Me neither.

01:30:27.053 --> 01:30:28.488
And I should probably start
practicing what I'm gonna say

01:30:28.521 --> 01:30:29.889
when I see
my parents.

01:30:32.392 --> 01:30:36.196
So, what you're saying
is, one final swim?

01:30:36.228 --> 01:30:37.563
I think we could
squeeze one in?

01:30:37.597 --> 01:30:39.332
Yeah!

01:30:39.933 --> 01:30:41.401
Let's go.

01:30:41.433 --> 01:30:43.637
<i>Phone rings,
You're parked outside</i>

01:30:43.670 --> 01:30:46.006
<i>Hair's up
My Chucks are tied</i>

01:30:46.039 --> 01:30:48.342
<i>You got a place in mind</i>

01:30:48.375 --> 01:30:50.410
<i>But I say let's improvise</i>

01:30:52.312 --> 01:30:55.582
<i>Let's go</i>

01:30:55.615 --> 01:30:57.951
<i>Straight down the 405</i>

01:30:57.983 --> 01:30:59.952
<i>Right past the county line</i>

01:30:59.986 --> 01:31:02.222
<i>Put your arm around me now</i>

01:31:02.254 --> 01:31:04.590
<i>Only got a few more hours</i>

01:31:04.624 --> 01:31:06.260
<i>So let's try to
make it count</i>

01:31:06.293 --> 01:31:08.929
<i>While the sun is</i>

01:31:08.961 --> 01:31:11.031
<i>Shining bright</i>

01:31:11.063 --> 01:31:14.066
<i>Speakers shaking</i>

01:31:14.099 --> 01:31:18.304
<i>Put that old
Mustang in drive</i>

01:31:18.338 --> 01:31:23.376
<i>Heart is yours
For the taking</i>

01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:27.247
<i>We don't have to say goodbye</i>

01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:28.916
<i>If it was summer forever</i>

01:31:30.150 --> 01:31:32.518
<i>Don't let me go</i>

01:31:32.552 --> 01:31:34.921
<i>Just kiss me slow</i>

01:31:34.955 --> 01:31:36.390
<i>Whoa</i>

01:31:36.423 --> 01:31:38.492
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>

01:31:39.992 --> 01:31:42.195
<i>Don't let it go</i>

01:31:42.228 --> 01:31:44.665
<i>Just kiss me slow</i>

01:31:44.697 --> 01:31:46.198
<i>Whoa</i>

01:31:46.232 --> 01:31:48.402
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>

01:31:48.434 --> 01:31:50.937
<i>Hands up and touch the rays</i>

01:31:50.970 --> 01:31:53.240
<i>Jump in and rush the waves</i>

01:31:53.272 --> 01:31:55.374
<i>This world is ours to take</i>

01:31:55.407 --> 01:31:57.710
<i>So never let the moment fade</i>

01:31:57.744 --> 01:32:02.081
<i>Don't let go</i>

01:32:02.115 --> 01:32:04.651
<i>Just snap a shot
Right through your shades</i>

01:32:04.683 --> 01:32:07.219
<i>Put it in a mental
Picture frame</i>

01:32:07.253 --> 01:32:09.356
<i>Put your arm around me now</i>

01:32:09.388 --> 01:32:12.025
<i>Only got a few more hours</i>

01:32:12.058 --> 01:32:13.493
<i>So let's try to
make it count</i>

01:32:13.526 --> 01:32:16.263
<i>While the sun is</i>

01:32:16.295 --> 01:32:18.264
<i>Shining bright</i>

01:32:18.298 --> 01:32:21.300
<i>Speakers shaking</i>

01:32:21.334 --> 01:32:25.639
<i>Put that old
Mustang in drive</i>

01:32:25.671 --> 01:32:30.544
<i>Heart is yours
For the taking</i>

01:32:30.576 --> 01:32:34.313
<i>We don't have to say goodbye</i>

01:32:34.347 --> 01:32:36.082
<i>If it was summer forever</i>

01:32:37.616 --> 01:32:39.753
<i>Don't let it go</i>

01:32:39.786 --> 01:32:42.155
<i>Just kiss me slow</i>

01:32:42.187 --> 01:32:43.556
<i>Whoa</i>

01:32:43.589 --> 01:32:45.659
<i>Wish it was
Summer forever</i>

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:49.229
<i>Don't let it go</i>

01:32:49.262 --> 01:32:51.630
<i>Just kiss me slow</i>

01:32:51.664 --> 01:32:53.332
<i>Whoa</i>

01:32:53.366 --> 01:32:55.669
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>

01:32:57.670 --> 01:33:02.743
<i>And when the sun goes down</i>

01:33:02.776 --> 01:33:07.481

Just hold me now</i>

01:33:12.352 --> 01:33:13.653
<i>Like it was summer forever</i>

01:33:13.686 --> 01:33:16.223
<i>Shining bright</i>

01:33:16.255 --> 01:33:18.691
<i>Speakers shaking</i>

01:33:18.724 --> 01:33:23.329
<i>Put that old
Mustang in drive</i>

01:33:23.362 --> 01:33:28.367
<i>Heart is yours
for the taking</i>

01:33:28.401 --> 01:33:31.638
<i>We don't have to say goodbye</i>

01:33:31.670 --> 01:33:33.673
<i>If it was summer forever</i>

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.443
<i>Don't let it go</i>

01:33:37.477 --> 01:33:39.679
<i>Just kiss me slow</i>

01:33:39.711 --> 01:33:41.348
<i>Whoa</i>

01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.249
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>

01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:47.086
<i>Don't let it go</i>

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.523
<i>Just kiss me slow</i>

01:33:49.555 --> 01:33:50.790
<i>Whoa</i>

01:33:50.823 --> 01:33:52.491
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>

01:33:52.525 --> 01:33:55.295
<i>Put your arm around me now</i>

01:33:55.327 --> 01:33:57.664
<i>Only got a few more hours</i>

01:33:57.696 --> 01:33:59.331
<i>So let's try to
make it count</i>

01:33:59.365 --> 01:34:00.534
<i>While the sun is</i>

01:34:00.567 --> 01:34:04.071
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>

01:34:04.103 --> 01:34:06.305
<i>Don't let it</i>

01:34:06.339 --> 01:34:08.742
<i>Just kiss me</i>

01:34:08.775 --> 01:34:10.143
<i>Whoa</i>

01:34:10.175 --> 01:34:12.178
<i>Wish it was summer forever</i>
