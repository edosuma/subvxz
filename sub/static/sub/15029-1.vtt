03:30.386 --> 03:32.455
Oh, my God!

03:32.855 --> 03:35.758
Come look at his shirt!
He's always nice to you!

03:35.858 --> 03:38.494
- I hate him!
- Ah, fuck you!

03:38.594 --> 03:42.265
- Come on, man!
- Let's go. Let's do this!

03:42.365 --> 03:44.700
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

03:46.602 --> 03:48.938
Yo, this was a great idea
for a graduation trip!

03:49.038 --> 03:51.374
- I told you, this place is the shit!
- You were right!

03:51.474 --> 03:54.644
Hey, you never told me Kelly's
little sister was so slamming hot!

03:54.744 --> 03:58.314
Oh, come on, bro, she was 16 when Kelly
and I started dating in college.

03:58.414 --> 04:00.817
- Ah...
- Besides, she lives in London.

04:00.917 --> 04:05.321
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Isn't the legal
age of consent, like, 16 in the UK?

04:05.421 --> 04:07.657
What are you doing to me?

04:07.757 --> 04:09.859
- Oh!
- You fucking asshole!

04:09.959 --> 04:12.361
- Yeah! Fucking party!
- Too slow, bitches!

04:12.461 --> 04:15.313
- Oh!
- This place fucking rules!

04:15.413 --> 04:16.999
- Oh, my God!
- Go!

04:17.099 --> 04:19.502
- Ok.
- Oh!

04:19.601 --> 04:22.505
Oh, that's your girlfriend.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.914
I love this song.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.785
Oh, my God! Look at fucking Brock!

04:35.885 --> 04:39.922
- He's such a douche bag.
- Oh!

04:40.022 --> 04:43.993
- Oh!
- Shut up, be serious.

04:44.093 --> 04:48.364
I wanna make a toast to the two girls
I love most in the world!

04:48.464 --> 04:52.568
- I love you, guys.
- I love you, girls, too!

04:56.172 --> 04:58.242
Oh, my God!

04:59.742 --> 05:03.979
- Wait up. More shots?
- Duh! We're in Europe!

05:04.079 --> 05:07.583
- Do you think Jesse is hot?
- Oh, you're kidding me.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.553
- No, no.
- He's always been nice to me.

05:10.653 --> 05:13.956
Uh, he's been friends
with Kevin since freshman year.

05:14.520 --> 05:17.123
- Hey! Whoo!
- Hey.

05:18.723 --> 05:20.168
Let's go!

05:20.268 --> 05:23.139
Guy, I just got us an invite
to a sick mansion party.

05:23.239 --> 05:27.210
DJ, drinks, free fucking everything.
Who's in?

05:27.310 --> 05:31.357
Fuck yeah! Let's go!
Now who wants a goddamn shot?

05:31.457 --> 05:34.326
- I'll take one.
- Cheers!

05:34.426 --> 05:36.895
- Cheers!
- Whoo!

06:14.833 --> 06:19.504
Fuck! I think I died
and went to heaven, bro!

06:44.663 --> 06:47.433
Hey, guys. I need to find a bathroom.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.701
I think I saw one
at the bottom of the stairs.

06:49.801 --> 06:51.703
Ok, great. I'll be right back.

06:51.803 --> 06:53.071
Ok.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.592
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

09:14.886 --> 09:18.509
- You scared me.
- Sorry about that. Wow.

09:19.009 --> 09:22.301
- A lot of really cool shit in here, huh?
- Yeah.

09:27.542 --> 09:31.043
Yeah, but we should probably get back.
The girls sent me to come find you.

09:31.143 --> 09:35.280
Look at how old these paintings are.
They must be worth a fortune.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.474
Hey, check this out.
They all have the same last name.

09:38.574 --> 09:41.782
You think they're part
of some kind of family lineage?

09:42.052 --> 09:45.256
Probably. I don't know.

09:45.356 --> 09:47.825
What I do know is that there
is an extremely large,

09:47.925 --> 09:51.612
muscular security guard walking around that
might kick us out if he found us in here.

09:51.712 --> 09:53.748
So we should probably
stick to the main party.

09:53.848 --> 09:56.384
- Good idea.
- Come on.

10:09.029 --> 10:11.232
- Drink up.
- All right.

10:11.332 --> 10:14.301
Hey! I'm gonna go get a drink.

10:16.470 --> 10:18.973
Bartender, two shots, please.

10:44.865 --> 10:48.135
- American.
- Uh, yeah.

10:48.235 --> 10:51.338
- I like your tats.
- And that's your friend.

10:51.438 --> 10:53.941
Who? Him?

10:54.041 --> 10:57.745
- Yeah, I guess.
- And his name?

10:57.845 --> 11:01.415
Brock. Do you want me to introduce...

11:04.185 --> 11:06.287
What the...

11:13.127 --> 11:16.831
- Whoa.
- Do you like rough girls?

11:17.965 --> 11:21.168
- Brock?
- Yes.

11:21.268 --> 11:23.504
I like. Fuck, I like.

11:23.604 --> 11:27.141
Gross! Look at all
her tattoos and piercings!

11:27.241 --> 11:29.910
She's the perfect girl.
She can take charge of him.

11:30.010 --> 11:32.313
I hope he chokes on her ring.

11:37.952 --> 11:40.988
Come on, fuckers, let's dance!

11:42.423 --> 11:44.125
Yay!

12:49.089 --> 12:52.526
Shit! I've never done
anything like this before.

12:52.626 --> 12:53.894
When in Vilnius, right? Fuck it.

12:53.994 --> 12:56.130
This will do.

12:56.230 --> 12:58.199
Ready to get down right here?

12:58.299 --> 13:02.269
Now, take off that shirt and fuck me hard.

13:02.369 --> 13:05.039
Oh, fuck.

13:07.675 --> 13:12.146
Yo, Amy! Meet Uta. Uta, meet Amy.

13:12.246 --> 13:15.015
Uta, that's a cool name.
Yeah, we kind of met earlier.

13:15.115 --> 13:18.853
Yeah. Uta means "prosperous
in battle" or some shit.

13:18.953 --> 13:22.089
We're gonna go back
to her tattoo parlor and check it out.

13:22.189 --> 13:24.291
- You're a tattoo artist?
- I'm an apprentice.

13:24.391 --> 13:27.294
But you should get a tattoo
from The Artist.

13:27.394 --> 13:30.364
- He's world famous.
- Really? That...

13:30.464 --> 13:34.068
Amy, um, I don't think that's such
a good idea. We were just leaving.

13:34.168 --> 13:38.272
Yeah. You coming to get a tattoo?

13:38.372 --> 13:42.042
Ok. Great. Well, let me tell the others.

13:42.142 --> 13:44.912
- Wait here.
- Cock blocker.

13:45.012 --> 13:47.648
Don't worry. This changes nothing.

13:47.748 --> 13:50.618
Hey, guys. Guys!
That girl's a tattoo artist.

13:50.718 --> 13:54.121
I'm gonna go back to her shop and get
a tattoo. Do you guys wanna come?

13:54.221 --> 13:58.239
We're ok. We're gonna stay here.
And then we're gonna head back to the hotel.

13:58.339 --> 14:02.496
Yeah, seriously. Come party with us.
You can get a tattoo tomorrow.

14:02.596 --> 14:05.599
- I'll come with you.
- Amy, she's a fucking freak.

14:05.699 --> 14:08.569
That shop is just a lame tourist trap.
They're a dime a dozen out here.

14:08.669 --> 14:11.071
Amy, Jesse's right. Stay here.

14:11.171 --> 14:14.074
You don't know that fucking girl.

14:41.435 --> 14:43.839
Give me those tits.

14:47.207 --> 14:50.344
Come back here! Come on!

14:50.444 --> 14:53.213
Come on!

15:29.716 --> 15:31.385
Get in.

15:52.206 --> 15:56.577
- What is that?
- It's human skin.

16:03.217 --> 16:05.286
Don't fucking touch that!

16:13.627 --> 16:16.130
You stay here.

16:16.230 --> 16:17.464
Ok.

16:20.144 --> 16:24.315
Oh, my God! Look at this dog!
He's beautiful.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.918
Hi, boy!

16:35.993 --> 16:38.196
Hi, boy.

16:41.065 --> 16:44.736
I see you're getting
acquainted with Beast.

16:46.336 --> 16:47.939
I'd be careful if I were you.

16:48.039 --> 16:52.043
No, he's a good boy. Aren't you?

16:52.143 --> 16:54.178
Yes, he is.

16:55.780 --> 16:58.282
Your shop is truly amazing.

16:58.382 --> 17:02.053
Yeah, bro, it's totally badass, man.
I love that tat.

17:02.153 --> 17:05.356
I was thinking of getting the same thing,
but check it out.

17:05.455 --> 17:07.959
Tyler James original, bro.

17:08.059 --> 17:11.061
Got that shit in Hollywood
before he passed away.

17:11.162 --> 17:13.330
Rest in peace, bro.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.869
Tyler's work is very distinctive.
I know it well.

17:18.970 --> 17:21.239
Now, which one of you
wants to get tattooed?

17:21.339 --> 17:23.941
- Bam.
- I do.

17:24.040 --> 17:28.946
Ok. Uta, my love, why don't you
show our... guest around

17:29.046 --> 17:32.150
- and make him feel at home.
- Yeah.

17:38.621 --> 17:40.524
One moment.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.802
Have a seat.

17:50.902 --> 17:53.805
- Nice jacket.
- Thank you.

17:58.843 --> 18:01.813
Fuck! Take it easy.

18:04.415 --> 18:07.351
Ow! Fuck! That fucking hurts!

18:12.824 --> 18:15.226
You are one crazy bitch.

18:19.397 --> 18:21.165
Fuck it.

18:27.572 --> 18:30.975
So what kind of tattoo you looking to get?

18:31.075 --> 18:34.979
Well, this might sound stupid,

18:35.079 --> 18:38.916
but I wanna get something
culturally relevant.

18:39.016 --> 18:43.321
You know? I was hoping that you
could kind of guide me as well.

18:43.421 --> 18:47.291
Something to remind myself
of this time in my life.

18:47.391 --> 18:50.128
That's not stupid at all.

18:50.228 --> 18:54.031
Finally, someone comes in
from another country

18:54.131 --> 18:57.267
and actually asks
about culture and history.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.304
Really, do you know
how refreshing that is to hear?

19:00.404 --> 19:02.073
I can imagine.

19:02.173 --> 19:05.909
So, uh, do you get a lot
of dumb tourists in here?

19:06.806 --> 19:11.214
You would not believe how many butterfly
tattoos and praying hands I've done.

19:11.314 --> 19:13.785
Don't get me wrong,
not that those are bad tattoos.

19:13.885 --> 19:17.221
It's just there was a time
when to be tattooed,

19:17.321 --> 19:23.127
extensively, meant you lived outside
the structures of conventional society.

19:23.227 --> 19:25.429
Now it's become conventional practice.

19:25.529 --> 19:27.781
Tattoo is commonplace.

19:27.881 --> 19:30.834
I don't know, maybe that's a good thing.
It's good for business.

19:30.934 --> 19:34.839
You know, art for me is like newborn baby.

19:34.939 --> 19:39.043
It's innocent, you know,
and not contest for judgment

19:39.143 --> 19:41.012
or for "wow, a trophy, man."

19:41.112 --> 19:43.314
Great tattoo artist. I don't care.

19:43.414 --> 19:44.816
It's art.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.151
- Yeah.
- You understand?

19:48.551 --> 19:49.987
You're different.

19:50.087 --> 19:52.924
- Yeah?
- It's not a question.

19:53.024 --> 19:56.527
I can see it. You're a rare breed.

20:38.169 --> 20:39.537
Hey.

20:49.347 --> 20:50.381
Where'd you go?

21:07.531 --> 21:09.100
Fuck!

21:10.634 --> 21:13.037
Whoa. What is this place?

21:13.137 --> 21:17.308
The Artist is a collector.

21:22.713 --> 21:26.083
This is the garrote.

21:27.183 --> 21:31.155
It was used to execute Spanish prisoners.

21:32.456 --> 21:34.392
Would you like to see how it's used?

21:34.492 --> 21:36.093
No. I'm good.

21:36.193 --> 21:39.463
But I wanna use you. Come here.

21:40.463 --> 21:42.233
I wanna fuck.

21:42.333 --> 21:44.168
Oh!

21:48.672 --> 21:53.210
Wow. These designs are beautiful.

21:55.646 --> 21:57.448
Yes, they are.

21:59.483 --> 22:04.121
- Hey, you want a drink?
- Sure. Yeah.

22:16.834 --> 22:19.236
Uh-uh!

22:35.853 --> 22:38.622
Oh, fuck yeah.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.269
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:54.505 --> 22:59.210
Mm. Hey. So...

22:59.310 --> 23:03.314
Your apprentice told us that
that was human skin.

23:03.414 --> 23:08.052
It's not really human, is it?

23:08.152 --> 23:10.722
Yes, it really is.

23:10.822 --> 23:14.291
- You see, in the Yakuza culture...
- The Yakuza?

23:15.391 --> 23:17.595
- I'm sorry...
- No, it's ok.

23:17.695 --> 23:22.466
The Yakuza are members of a trans-national
organized crime syndicate in Japan.

23:22.566 --> 23:27.571
In their culture, the tattoo artist
owns the art and canvas, or skin,

23:27.671 --> 23:30.608
once the person passes on.

23:30.708 --> 23:34.612
- So were you the artist?
- I wish. No, I...

23:34.712 --> 23:37.081
I obtained this piece
from a very dear friend of mine.

23:37.181 --> 23:40.117
Wow. That's crazy.

23:40.217 --> 23:44.121
Well, you know, crazy to you, perhaps,
but, you know, it is their tradition.

23:44.221 --> 23:48.459
And it's... it's a great honor

23:48.559 --> 23:50.594
to be tattooed.

23:57.468 --> 23:59.403
Hey, buddy. Steph and I
are gonna go back to the hotel.

23:59.503 --> 24:03.641
- Uh, have you seen Amy?
- She left with Brock.

24:03.741 --> 24:08.379
I saw them leave...
fall down the stairs earlier.

24:08.479 --> 24:11.315
She's probably back at the hotel partying.

24:14.485 --> 24:17.421
Ok. We'll catch up with you later, buddy.

24:41.579 --> 24:43.614
I like this one. What does it mean?

24:47.451 --> 24:50.754
Great choice. Its literal translation...

24:50.854 --> 24:53.691
"Love forever."

26:12.468 --> 26:17.374
Fuck! Hey. Slow down.
I don't wanna bust yet.

26:17.474 --> 26:21.077
- Harder. Harder!
- Oh, fuck!

26:25.549 --> 26:27.918
I'm gonna come. Almost.

26:28.018 --> 26:30.170
Oh, fuck!

26:30.921 --> 26:32.990
Fucking bitch!

26:53.110 --> 26:58.482
So, Amy, what do you do
back in the States?

26:59.917 --> 27:02.419
Mm, I'm a student.

27:02.519 --> 27:06.957
And I'm supposed to go to
medical school in a couple of months.

27:09.093 --> 27:10.961
Um, we're here on vacation.

27:11.061 --> 27:13.798
And I really like it.

27:14.898 --> 27:20.037
There's some doubt in your voice
about medical school.

27:20.137 --> 27:22.628
Am I that transparent?

27:23.640 --> 27:27.645
Yeah, I mean, it's what I should do.

27:27.745 --> 27:30.648
I'm just not sure if it's what I want to.

27:31.949 --> 27:34.551
Should do? Said who?

27:34.651 --> 27:37.421
Boyfriend?

27:37.521 --> 27:40.791
You dictate your own destiny.

27:40.891 --> 27:44.028
You still have time

27:44.128 --> 27:46.497
to find your true passion.

27:48.732 --> 27:50.000
True.

27:50.100 --> 27:53.037
Sometimes...

27:53.137 --> 27:55.906
you don't know until you try something.

27:56.006 --> 27:59.476
Hey, um...

27:59.576 --> 28:02.012
I think I might have drank too much.

28:02.112 --> 28:04.682
I'm feeling kind of lightheaded.

28:15.159 --> 28:17.628
Amy!

28:17.728 --> 28:19.663
Run!

28:22.900 --> 28:25.636
What did you do?

28:46.723 --> 28:48.926
You're right.

28:49.026 --> 28:51.795
He's perfect.

28:51.895 --> 28:55.399
No moles, no marks.

28:55.499 --> 28:57.968
No scars.

29:26.163 --> 29:28.098
Amy.

29:28.198 --> 29:31.502
Amy! Amy!

29:34.004 --> 29:35.572
What are you doing?

29:35.672 --> 29:37.174
What the fuck are you doing?

29:37.274 --> 29:39.877
No, please! Please, help!

29:39.977 --> 29:42.012
Somebody help!

29:42.112 --> 29:44.081
Please!

29:46.550 --> 29:48.919
Amy, wake up. Amy.

29:51.722 --> 29:53.890
What the fuck are you doing?

30:03.800 --> 30:06.136
Amy!

30:06.236 --> 30:09.606
Amy. Wake up.

30:09.706 --> 30:10.908
What are you doing?

30:11.008 --> 30:12.676
What are you doing?

30:12.776 --> 30:15.446
What the fuck are you doing? Stop!

30:15.546 --> 30:17.714
Wait, wait, wait.

30:17.814 --> 30:20.551
Wait, let's talk about this.
Wait. Wait. Stop!

30:20.651 --> 30:23.954
Please, no. Wait, wait.
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

30:24.054 --> 30:27.858
Oh, don't do this. No, no, no! No! Don't!

30:29.480 --> 30:32.496
No, no, no, no.

30:40.771 --> 30:43.240
Fuck!

30:43.340 --> 30:45.171
Please!

30:46.677 --> 30:49.513
Oh, no, no, no! Oh!

30:49.613 --> 30:51.784
Oh! Stop!

30:56.172 --> 30:58.974
Stop, please!

30:59.074 --> 31:01.277
What are you gonna do?

31:09.852 --> 31:11.541
Amy...

31:12.955 --> 31:14.823
There's so much I want to share with you.

31:14.923 --> 31:18.861
You're probably wondering
why you can't move.

31:18.961 --> 31:22.631
- Well, you and your friend...
- Fuck you!

31:22.731 --> 31:26.835
- Let us go!
- ...have been injected

31:26.935 --> 31:31.874
with a neuromuscular blocker from
the venom of a blue-ringed octopus.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.277
I find... it works quite well.

31:37.046 --> 31:40.950
And don't worry about it,
you can still feel everything.

31:41.050 --> 31:44.620
Which is very important to this process.

31:44.720 --> 31:49.224
You're sick!
Just let us go, please! Please!

31:50.693 --> 31:52.962
Please stop!

31:58.467 --> 32:01.170
Please, just let us go! Please!

32:01.270 --> 32:04.740
No! No, don't! Ah!

32:04.840 --> 32:07.676
Brock! Oh, God!

32:09.141 --> 32:11.947
Oh, fuck!

32:14.379 --> 32:16.185
Oh, fuck!

32:20.104 --> 32:22.018
No!

32:23.059 --> 32:26.796
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, God!

32:36.562 --> 32:37.897
Please...

32:37.997 --> 32:40.966
Let us go.

32:41.066 --> 32:43.402
Look at him, crying like a cunt.

32:43.502 --> 32:46.238
Fuck you! Fuck you!

32:46.338 --> 32:49.408
Let me go!

32:51.294 --> 32:53.665
My friends,

32:53.765 --> 32:55.833
they have money. Please.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.621
I'll do anything.

33:04.290 --> 33:06.961
Sorry, but money cannot help you.

33:08.563 --> 33:11.599
And I'm afraid you have
so much left to give.

33:16.137 --> 33:21.575
You know, I used to feed my dog pig ears.

33:32.863 --> 33:36.000
But they just don't have
the same nutritional value.

33:36.100 --> 33:37.235
Beast.

33:41.773 --> 33:44.976
You're sick. Fuck you!

33:45.076 --> 33:48.379
Listen to him when he speaks to you, cunt!

33:48.479 --> 33:50.815
Uta, Uta.

33:50.915 --> 33:53.184
Release her throat.

33:57.355 --> 33:59.924
You're dead.

34:07.984 --> 34:11.121
Amy, what are they doing?

34:11.221 --> 34:14.058
This will shut you up, pussy boy.

34:14.158 --> 34:17.293
Leave him alone, you freak!

34:17.393 --> 34:21.498
The skin is the ultimate canvas.

34:26.437 --> 34:30.641
Flaying, or the process of removing
the skin from the body,

34:30.741 --> 34:35.478
is actually an ancient practice used
by the Assyrians in the Ming dynasty.

34:35.578 --> 34:38.915
They used to do it merely
for execution and torture.

34:39.016 --> 34:40.650
Certain tribes in Europe discovered...

34:40.751 --> 34:43.353
- No!
- The skin can serve

34:43.454 --> 34:48.025
a much higher... purpose.

34:48.125 --> 34:51.362
Since you're a medical student, Amy,
or contemplating medical school,

34:51.462 --> 34:54.565
obviously you know there
are seven layers of skin.

34:54.665 --> 34:57.067
Skin is actually an organ.

34:57.167 --> 35:00.337
We need to cut through all seven layers

35:00.437 --> 35:04.642
in order to create the perfect... canvas.

35:07.044 --> 35:11.949
- There.
- Why? Why are you doing this to us?

35:12.049 --> 35:14.285
Why?

35:20.324 --> 35:22.293
No! Stop!

35:32.736 --> 35:37.675
Stop! Please! Don't!

35:41.478 --> 35:45.549
Amy, this is perhaps
the most important step.

35:45.649 --> 35:48.185
No! No!

35:48.285 --> 35:50.020
- If you don't use this tool...
- Stop!

35:50.120 --> 35:54.725
...correctly to separate the skin...

35:55.825 --> 35:59.463
From the muscle, you can tear the canvas

35:59.563 --> 36:02.700
rendering it completely useless.

36:02.800 --> 36:07.404
In our case, you'd need another donor.

36:20.692 --> 36:22.961
What are you?

36:28.105 --> 36:30.680
Brock, I'm sorry.

36:32.110 --> 36:34.246
Why?

36:37.602 --> 36:40.638
Brock, please don't leave me.

36:40.738 --> 36:43.574
Oh, God.

36:55.820 --> 36:59.557
You see, Amy? The Yakuza got it all wrong.

36:59.657 --> 37:03.394
Skinning a dead man's body
only wounds the canvas.

37:03.494 --> 37:05.463
Elasticity is gone.

37:05.563 --> 37:09.333
Sure, the ink stays,
but it's the poor man's version.

37:10.656 --> 37:11.970
Why?

37:12.070 --> 37:14.539
Why are you doing this to us?

37:14.639 --> 37:18.643
I'm sure this is all a bit
much to wrap your brain around.

37:18.743 --> 37:22.680
In time, you'll see.

37:25.316 --> 37:29.420
Uta, take this canvas
to the gallery, prepare it.

37:34.659 --> 37:36.361
You're sick!

37:38.529 --> 37:44.002
What are you gonna do?
Please, just let us go!

37:44.102 --> 37:48.439
He needs... he needs medical attention!

37:48.539 --> 37:50.519
Please!

37:51.276 --> 37:53.278
Let us go!

37:58.916 --> 38:00.385
Why?

39:55.542 --> 39:57.544
Oh, fuck.

40:03.850 --> 40:06.719
You better not like
that slut more than me.

40:07.419 --> 40:09.856
Only you.

40:13.826 --> 40:16.696
- Who is it?
- It's us! Let us in!

40:16.796 --> 40:20.166
- Oh, go away!
- Oh, my God, seriously! Let us in!

40:20.266 --> 40:23.169
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

40:28.341 --> 40:30.743
I see you later.

40:39.752 --> 40:43.522
- She's got great timing.
- I fucking hate Stephanie.

40:49.662 --> 40:51.547
Hello.

40:56.069 --> 40:57.904
Jeez. Wow.

40:59.606 --> 41:01.541
This is where I should have been, huh?

41:01.641 --> 41:04.444
- Seriously?
- Shut the fuck up, Jesse.

41:04.544 --> 41:07.547
- Fuck.
- What's so important anyway?

41:07.647 --> 41:12.485
Well, we checked all the rooms,
and there is no sign of Brock or Amy.

41:12.585 --> 41:15.488
Um, ok. And?

41:15.588 --> 41:16.923
And they didn't come back last night.

41:17.023 --> 41:20.409
I've been trying to tell her, I'm sure
Amy just hooked up with the loser.

41:20.509 --> 41:21.694
- Know what I mean?
- Hey, chill, man.

41:21.794 --> 41:23.930
No, no. There's no way that Amy
would hook up with Brock,

41:24.030 --> 41:27.455
and she definitely wouldn't just...
not come back and not tell anybody.

41:27.555 --> 41:30.277
Exactly. We went downstairs,
and they haven't seen them either.

41:30.377 --> 41:32.554
They left no messages.

41:32.654 --> 41:36.396
Ok, well, they were heading to that
tattoo parlor with that freaky chick.

41:36.496 --> 41:38.445
Can anyone remember the name of it?

41:38.545 --> 41:40.747
- Or her?
- We were wasted last night.

41:40.847 --> 41:44.083
I barely remember anything
about last night. Ow.

41:44.183 --> 41:48.221
I'll check Brock's profile.
He usually updates his photos.

41:48.321 --> 41:51.825
Wait. Let me see that.

41:57.764 --> 42:00.934
Yeah. Looks like, uh,
Brock was obsessed with Amy.

42:01.034 --> 42:03.169
I just solved your case.

42:03.269 --> 42:05.472
No, he's just a pig.

42:05.572 --> 42:08.508
Yeah. Looks like Jesse's right.

42:08.608 --> 42:10.643
I got fucking nothing.

42:10.743 --> 42:12.645
Ok, look. I'm starting
to get a bit worried.

42:12.745 --> 42:14.113
Maybe we should go out and look for them.

42:14.213 --> 42:16.182
- Yeah.
- Oh, don't freak out, everybody.

42:16.282 --> 42:18.585
- I'm sure they're fine.
- The brains of the group.

42:18.685 --> 42:21.921
Give us five minutes. We're gonna get changed
and we'll meet you down in the lobby.

42:22.021 --> 42:24.023
Come on, let's go.

42:34.904 --> 42:36.139
Amy.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.243
I want to show you something special.

42:41.511 --> 42:43.783
A gift so unique...

42:45.715 --> 42:48.117
It only happens once in a lifetime.

42:50.019 --> 42:55.758
Perhaps you've heard of the Irezumi,
or the hand-poked method of tattooing.

42:58.761 --> 43:01.297
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

43:01.397 --> 43:04.834
But please, please just let me go.

43:10.073 --> 43:15.111
I dip this needle in ink,
and poke it through your skin,

43:15.211 --> 43:17.080
hundreds of times.

43:19.449 --> 43:23.853
And you will feel each poke.

43:27.890 --> 43:29.292
You must hold still.

43:31.327 --> 43:33.262
You have such beautiful skin.

44:01.858 --> 44:03.893
Stop!

44:23.337 --> 44:26.840
We went down one that looked like it.
It wasn't this one.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.676
I'm telling you that on the map,
there's one down here.

44:29.776 --> 44:31.211
- I swear.
- This is it?

44:31.311 --> 44:34.247
- It's here.
- All right. Go.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.318
Let me try, let me try.

44:43.423 --> 44:46.226
- Kevin, what happened back there?
- Don't worry about it.

44:46.326 --> 44:51.165
- I think we should call the cops.
- No, no. Wait to see what Jesse's got.

44:51.265 --> 44:54.835
This is the seventh tattoo place
that we've been to.

44:54.935 --> 44:56.770
This was your idea.

44:59.740 --> 45:03.744
Guys, the owner just told me that freak
works at a place called The Parlor,

45:03.844 --> 45:05.479
- not too far from here.
- Really?

45:05.579 --> 45:07.214
- Yeah.
- All right, cool. Let's go.

45:07.314 --> 45:09.283
Let's do it. Come on.

45:11.685 --> 45:14.070
Come on.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.556
- Straight ahead, right?
- Yeah, right up here on the corner.

45:16.857 --> 45:20.494
Jesse, you going the right way?

45:20.594 --> 45:22.796
Right up here. Right around the corner.

45:24.931 --> 45:28.101
We should really go back
to the hotel room.

45:28.201 --> 45:31.138
I think we'll find them. We'll find them.

45:31.238 --> 45:34.040
You have to trust me.

45:34.140 --> 45:37.511
Hey, guys. Uh, don't pay
attention to these fuckers.

45:37.611 --> 45:39.112
Just walk. Don't even look at them.

45:50.667 --> 45:53.692
- Jesse, what the fuck are you doing?
- Jesse, what the fuck?

45:53.793 --> 45:55.996
Jesse!

45:56.396 --> 45:58.765
You fucked with the wrong crew,
motherfucker!

45:58.865 --> 46:01.601
- You fucked with the wrong crew! Fucker!
- Jesse!

46:01.701 --> 46:04.070
What the fuck? Chill out!

46:04.170 --> 46:08.375
- What the fuck was that?
- Dude, calm down. Chill!

46:08.475 --> 46:10.787
- Relax. It's cool.
- It's cool?

46:10.887 --> 46:12.969
"You fucked with the wrong crew"?
Who are you?

46:13.069 --> 46:14.881
Are you kidding me?
Those kids were planning something!

46:14.981 --> 46:17.268
- How the fuck do you know?
- Stop!

46:17.368 --> 46:19.853
They could have pulled a gun
and killed us!

46:19.953 --> 46:23.723
You just risked our lives! You're no hero!

46:23.823 --> 46:27.327
Whatever, I'm protecting us,
and I'm the fucking villain?

46:27.427 --> 46:28.728
- Unbelievable.
- Jesse!

46:28.828 --> 46:30.964
- Un-fucking-believable.
- Jesse!

46:31.064 --> 46:32.832
What the...

46:45.111 --> 46:46.913
I can't believe what just happened.

46:47.013 --> 46:50.417
I wish Amy would have called you
and told you where she was going.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.719
Jesse, are you sure this is the place?

46:52.819 --> 46:55.055
Yeah. It says "parlor."

46:59.459 --> 47:01.895
Hello? Anyone here?

47:14.340 --> 47:17.744
- How can I help you?
- Uh, hi. We're looking for our friends.

47:17.844 --> 47:20.146
Um, they came here last night
with a goth girl.

47:20.246 --> 47:23.016
She was covered in tattoos and had heels.

47:23.116 --> 47:25.385
Yes. You mean my apprentice, Uta.

47:25.485 --> 47:29.255
- So you've seen them?
- Yes, I saw both of them. I, um...

47:29.355 --> 47:31.291
I tattooed your friend...

47:34.494 --> 47:36.496
- Amy?
- Yeah, Amy. That's her. Yeah.

47:36.596 --> 47:40.400
Yeah, I finished her tattoo about 4:00 am,
and her and the guy left.

47:40.500 --> 47:45.105
Did maybe your apprentice girl,
Uta, go with them somewhere?

47:45.205 --> 47:49.309
She lives here, so I don't see how that's
possible, and we closed after they left.

47:49.409 --> 47:52.178
Guys, can we leave this
shithole? They're not here.

47:52.278 --> 47:56.916
Jesse, chill out.
Sorry, sir, he can be a bit of a hothead.

47:58.218 --> 48:00.820
Hm. I'm sorry I can't be more help.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.922
If you guys ever want a great tattoo,

48:03.022 --> 48:07.193
you're welcome back
to this shithole any time.

48:07.293 --> 48:08.995
I hope you find them.

48:09.095 --> 48:11.264
Thanks. We appreciate it.

48:11.364 --> 48:13.166
Let's go.

48:46.199 --> 48:49.035
Oh. I just met your friends.

48:49.135 --> 48:53.406
They really do seem concerned about you.

48:53.506 --> 48:55.975
What did you do?

48:56.075 --> 48:59.879
Don't hurt them. Please, don't hurt them.

48:59.979 --> 49:02.916
I'll do anything, anything you want.

49:03.016 --> 49:05.285
Oh, I know you will.

49:05.385 --> 49:07.253
Don't worry.

49:07.353 --> 49:10.323
They have no interest in me.
I sent them on their way.

49:12.292 --> 49:14.294
Amy...

49:17.664 --> 49:20.567
This tattoo will forever bond you to me.

49:20.667 --> 49:24.437
Every time you look in the mirror,

49:24.537 --> 49:26.406
you will see me.

49:28.474 --> 49:30.910
You will see us.

49:31.010 --> 49:32.445
I will be with you wherever you go.

49:32.545 --> 49:38.418
You're crazy if you think
I'll be bonded to you forever.

49:45.625 --> 49:47.327
You wanted a tattoo

49:47.427 --> 49:53.032
that would make you
remember your trip, right?

49:55.268 --> 49:57.470
I think you'll find this appropriate.

50:21.461 --> 50:22.996
Oh, my God!

50:35.174 --> 50:38.311
Ok, guys, I really think
we should call the police.

50:38.411 --> 50:41.481
I agree. I don't trust that guy.
He looked criminal.

50:41.581 --> 50:45.218
- Why, because he had tattoos?
- No, that's not the point.

50:45.318 --> 50:48.454
Oh, come on, guys.
You think we should report them missing?

50:48.554 --> 50:51.291
Yeah, you ladies are
blowing this out of proportion.

50:51.391 --> 50:55.161
You know, I think that Brock just
hooked up with your "angelic" friend, Amy,

50:55.261 --> 50:58.230
and they're just sleeping
off their hangovers somewhere.

50:58.330 --> 51:02.068
You're so stupid, Jesse.
Amy wouldn't do that.

51:02.180 --> 51:07.373
Whatever. How could they be missing?
It hasn't even been a day yet.

51:07.473 --> 51:11.210
Seriously, stop it. What is your problem?
You're being a total dick.

51:11.310 --> 51:14.380
That's my problem.
Guys, we're on vacation, ok?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.649
There's no way I'm ruining it
looking for that asshole.

51:16.749 --> 51:19.085
What the fuck, Jesse?
Come on, bro. You're out of line.

51:19.185 --> 51:23.056
- You too, huh?
- Guys, guys, stop. He remembered Amy's name.

51:23.156 --> 51:24.457
Ok, and why is that important?

51:24.557 --> 51:27.493
- Did he remember Brock's?
- Ok, Sherlock.

51:27.593 --> 51:30.363
- What are you getting at?
- Seriously, please. Fuck off.

51:30.463 --> 51:33.499
Kev, let me see Brock's profile again.

51:36.702 --> 51:39.272
- What's wrong?
- I knew I'd seen that design before.

51:39.372 --> 51:41.641
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Guys, look!

51:41.741 --> 51:43.409
- Look!
- What? Where?

51:43.509 --> 51:46.346
It was hanging in that
creepy tattoo parlor.

51:46.446 --> 51:51.150
Oh, my God! That fucker's got
Brock's tattoo in his parlor.

51:51.250 --> 51:54.153
Wait, wait, wait. Stop.

51:54.253 --> 51:58.224
Wait, now.
What are you guys talking about?

51:58.324 --> 52:01.260
You're fucking nuts.
How can there be Brock's tattoo?

52:01.360 --> 52:05.298
I'm sure that really generic
douchebag design is in front

52:05.398 --> 52:07.467
of every fucking tattoo shop ever.

52:07.567 --> 52:10.003
I know that freak and his bitch
have got something to do with this.

52:10.103 --> 52:12.705
- We've got to go back and check it out.
- No fucking way.

52:12.805 --> 52:15.341
We're not going back there.
Let's just call the police.

52:15.441 --> 52:19.212
Are you guys fucking kidding me?
You're all nuts.

52:19.312 --> 52:21.781
We're on vacation in Europe.

52:21.881 --> 52:25.018
And it's beautiful out. And you
wanna go on a wild goose chase,

52:25.118 --> 52:28.521
and back at that parlor with that
fucking psycho-killer-looking dude.

52:28.621 --> 52:32.492
Seriously? It hasn't
even been 24 hours yet.

52:32.592 --> 52:34.260
The cops will laugh at us.

52:34.360 --> 52:38.231
Back home, it's at least, 48 hours before
you can file a missing person's report?

52:38.331 --> 52:41.267
Exactly, in the fucking United States.
This is Lithuania.

52:41.367 --> 52:43.503
Yeah, out here it's
probably two fucking weeks.

52:43.603 --> 52:47.073
- Oh, my God. I... Oh!
- Kev, look at me.

52:47.173 --> 52:50.676
Amy'd do the same. You know it.

52:52.645 --> 52:54.180
Ok. We'll go check it out.

52:54.280 --> 52:57.083
You know what? Fuck this.

52:57.183 --> 53:00.086
You guys are nuts. I'm not going.

53:00.186 --> 53:02.221
- Fine, stay here.
- Wow.

53:02.321 --> 53:05.591
- Fuck you, Jesse.
- You turned out to be a total fucking idiot.

53:05.691 --> 53:08.094
And you're just mediocre in bed.
I've had better.

53:08.194 --> 53:11.130
- Ok! Come on, guys!
- Thank you...

53:11.230 --> 53:13.666
Enough! Jesse,
we'll call you if we find them.

53:13.766 --> 53:16.335
- You do likewise, all right?
- Just please fuck off.

53:16.435 --> 53:18.638
- Yeah, right...
- All right! Come on.

53:18.738 --> 53:20.540
Dick.

53:20.640 --> 53:24.577
I'm sorry. Don't worry,
we'll find Amy and Brock.

53:49.902 --> 53:52.705
Vodka, rocks, now.

53:56.909 --> 53:58.611
- How's your day going?
- Good. And you?

53:58.711 --> 54:01.514
- Yep. Now.
- Enjoy.

54:01.614 --> 54:02.748
Yeah.

54:06.986 --> 54:10.256
Can I take you to a table? Yeah?

54:58.704 --> 55:00.706
See? I told you!

55:00.806 --> 55:04.376
That... that tattoo
does look like his design.

55:06.445 --> 55:09.215
- What the fuck?
- You're here to see your friends?

55:09.315 --> 55:12.385
- What did you say?
- Your boss said they left late last night.

55:12.485 --> 55:15.221
Our friends are here!
Where are they and where's Amy?

55:15.321 --> 55:18.224
We're having a party for them.

55:18.324 --> 55:19.959
Would you like to join us?

55:20.059 --> 55:21.694
No, we would not like to join you!

55:21.794 --> 55:23.196
Where's Amy?

55:23.296 --> 55:25.898
I don't know,
but maybe they are downstairs.

55:25.998 --> 55:28.901
- What?
- Come on down.

55:29.901 --> 55:33.196
- Seriously?
- All right, let's just go, come on!

55:40.639 --> 55:42.574
Where the fuck are they?

55:42.674 --> 55:46.511
How do you say it? Relax!

55:46.611 --> 55:49.615
I'll get your friends.

55:49.715 --> 55:52.451
We need to find Amy and Brock
and get the fuck out of here.

55:52.551 --> 55:56.488
I don't know,
I think we should just call Jesse.

55:56.588 --> 56:00.659
- Fuck! No service.
- Shit!

56:00.759 --> 56:03.595
Come on, come on!

56:05.230 --> 56:07.198
Got it!

56:09.167 --> 56:12.905
Come on, Jesse. Come on,
pick up your fucking phone.

56:13.005 --> 56:15.240
Fuck!

56:39.563 --> 56:41.032
Voicemail.

56:43.335 --> 56:46.405
Hey, Jesse, where are you?
We're at that fucking parlor.

56:46.505 --> 56:48.507
Please call me back.

56:48.607 --> 56:52.377
- He's not picking up.
- Well, call 911 or something!

56:55.514 --> 56:57.382
- Kevin!
- What...

56:58.532 --> 57:00.968
Steph, run!

57:11.797 --> 57:13.198
What the fuck?

57:20.372 --> 57:23.141
Amy! Amy!

57:23.241 --> 57:26.678
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

57:26.778 --> 57:29.081
- Run!
- No!

57:29.181 --> 57:31.083
Kelly!

57:57.409 --> 58:00.445
- Shit.
- Hey, it's Jesse, where are you?

58:00.545 --> 58:03.715
We're at that fucking parlor.
Please call me back.

58:05.817 --> 58:07.285
Fuck it.

58:17.362 --> 58:21.199
- Would you like a dance?
- Yeah. Fuck it, why not?

59:11.416 --> 59:16.223
Kelly! Kelly, wake up! Wake up!

59:16.323 --> 59:18.491
Kelly, please wake up!

59:21.761 --> 59:24.931
Kelly, Kelly, you have
to try and get down.

59:25.381 --> 59:28.151
These people are fucking crazy.

59:30.770 --> 59:34.073
Kevin! Oh, my God!

59:34.173 --> 59:37.677
I don't know what the fuck's going on!

59:37.777 --> 59:40.913
Why... why is Stephanie on that table?

59:42.365 --> 59:44.267
Steph!

59:44.367 --> 59:47.570
Steph! What are they gonna do to her?

59:47.920 --> 59:51.057
They're skinning people alive.

59:51.657 --> 59:57.230
They killed Brock right in front of me.
It's so fucked!

59:57.330 --> 01:00:00.366
Kelly, we have to get out
of here before they get back!

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:03.836
Stephanie. Stephanie!

01:00:05.186 --> 01:00:07.053
Stephanie!

01:00:07.153 --> 01:00:08.908
- Kelly, they're back.
- Steph!

01:00:09.008 --> 01:00:10.376
- Kelly!
- Stephanie!

01:00:10.476 --> 01:00:12.912
- Kelly!
- Stephanie!

01:00:13.012 --> 01:00:15.715
- Please. Please...
- Steph!

01:00:15.815 --> 01:00:18.818
- Please. Please.
- Steph!

01:00:18.918 --> 01:00:21.988
- Hey, please!
- You fucking bitch!

01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:24.957
- Don't touch them, please.
- Bitch!

01:00:25.057 --> 01:00:28.027
- Please, no!
- Steph!

01:00:28.127 --> 01:00:31.764
- Stephanie!
- No, no, no!

01:00:31.864 --> 01:00:35.134
- No, no!
- No! Steph!

01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:45.845
I suggest you calm down,

01:00:45.945 --> 01:00:48.448
or she will die

01:00:48.548 --> 01:00:52.018
earlier than we anticipated.

01:00:52.118 --> 01:00:53.219
Why?

01:00:53.319 --> 01:00:55.755
Why us?

01:00:55.855 --> 01:00:58.357
Please don't hurt her!

01:00:58.457 --> 01:01:00.827
Take me!

01:01:00.927 --> 01:01:03.096
Take me.

01:01:09.902 --> 01:01:15.007
Kelly, I told you to leave.

01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:19.078
You had the choice.

01:01:21.414 --> 01:01:25.785
But, as fate would have it,

01:01:25.885 --> 01:01:27.453
you came back.

01:01:29.422 --> 01:01:32.925
So, here we are.

01:01:38.164 --> 01:01:40.800
Uta, my love.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.870
This one will work.

01:01:45.404 --> 01:01:47.540
It's tainted.

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:51.146
Yes, she's a perfect canvas
for your lessons.

01:01:51.246 --> 01:01:55.451
Remember to make straight lines
to ensure an even peel.

01:01:57.653 --> 01:02:02.258
Slow... And even.

01:02:02.358 --> 01:02:04.093
Understand?

01:02:06.462 --> 01:02:09.298
Save the other two for me.

01:02:09.398 --> 01:02:13.068
They are unexpected, but we can use them.

01:02:13.168 --> 01:02:16.972
The Swiss called with another order.

01:02:17.072 --> 01:02:19.475
I have an appointment to get to.

01:02:22.544 --> 01:02:24.146
Uta,

01:02:24.246 --> 01:02:28.417
you are not to lay a finger on Amy...

01:02:30.119 --> 01:02:33.255
...no matter what

01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:35.224
until I return.

01:02:37.126 --> 01:02:39.194
Do you understand?

01:02:40.662 --> 01:02:42.298
Ok.

01:03:02.551 --> 01:03:04.219
Fuck you!

01:03:08.357 --> 01:03:10.526
Kel... Kelly!

01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:13.262
I can't... I can't move!

01:03:13.362 --> 01:03:15.197
- Don't you fucking touch her!
- I can't move!

01:03:15.297 --> 01:03:18.062
Leave her alone!

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.102
What's that?

01:03:23.639 --> 01:03:27.409
Stop! Stop! Aah!

01:03:27.509 --> 01:03:30.312
Kelly! Kelly!

01:03:33.729 --> 01:03:36.798
I forgot to use the fucking tool!

01:03:39.968 --> 01:03:41.536
No, stop, stop!

01:03:41.636 --> 01:03:43.705
No! No, leave her alone!

01:03:43.805 --> 01:03:45.073
Stop!

01:04:05.594 --> 01:04:08.897
Oh, my God!

01:06:59.603 --> 01:07:02.172
I'm Zala. What's your name?

01:07:02.272 --> 01:07:05.476
- That your real name?
- Hm. No.

01:07:07.076 --> 01:07:08.702
I'm Jesse.

01:07:08.802 --> 01:07:11.215
Hey, Jesse. My shift's finishing.

01:07:11.315 --> 01:07:13.050
Do you wanna get drinks?

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:15.919
I gotta meet some friends
at a tattoo parlor.

01:07:16.019 --> 01:07:19.590
Uh, would you come with me?
We'll party after.

01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:23.227
- Tattoo? Really?
- Yep.

01:07:23.327 --> 01:07:26.129
Do they do piercings?

01:07:26.229 --> 01:07:29.533
I wanna do my clit.

01:07:29.633 --> 01:07:33.537
I don't know. Yes.
I think so, I don't know.

01:07:33.637 --> 01:07:36.639
Ok. Let me throw something on.

01:07:39.276 --> 01:07:42.012
And I'll meet you outside in five.

01:08:08.305 --> 01:08:11.742
I can't touch you.

01:08:14.845 --> 01:08:17.113
But I can play with your friend.

01:08:19.116 --> 01:08:21.551
Fuck you! Ugh!

01:08:34.865 --> 01:08:37.134
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:08:37.234 --> 01:08:39.527
Fuck you!

01:09:00.156 --> 01:09:01.791
Hold it!

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:04.627
Don't let go! Don't let go!
You're almost there!

01:09:21.912 --> 01:09:24.515
It's ok. You can't free me. Go get help.

01:09:24.615 --> 01:09:28.185
Ok, ok! I promise, I promise
I will come back for you and Kevin.

01:09:28.285 --> 01:09:31.220
I promise I will come back!

01:09:31.321 --> 01:09:34.057
- I promise, I promise!
- Hurry! Run! Run!

01:09:52.908 --> 01:09:56.045
Oh, my God! Somebody help!

01:10:49.433 --> 01:10:53.170
Help! Help!

01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:03.266
Fuck!

01:13:31.244 --> 01:13:33.485
What have you done?

01:13:35.945 --> 01:13:38.213
Have I taught you nothing?

01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:40.916
Leave us.

01:13:50.358 --> 01:13:51.493
Amy.

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:56.398
Amy. Amy. Amy, it's ok. It's me.

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.403
You ok?

01:14:01.503 --> 01:14:05.240
Fuck you! No, I'm not ok!

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.410
You're fucking crazy.

01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.797
Kelly's coming back with the police.

01:14:19.104 --> 01:14:20.690
No.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:24.277
I'm afraid Kelly won't be returning to us.

01:14:31.187 --> 01:14:32.785
No!

01:14:34.219 --> 01:14:36.055
Kelly!

01:14:39.424 --> 01:14:41.226
Amy.

01:14:41.326 --> 01:14:45.798
You're bleeding pretty badly.
Let me help you.

01:14:46.632 --> 01:14:48.734
What? What do you care?

01:14:48.834 --> 01:14:52.104
You're just gonna kill me anyway.

01:15:46.491 --> 01:15:48.894
Please be seated.

01:16:16.255 --> 01:16:19.525
In the middle ages,
a Russian king began the practice

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:25.230
of having his family portraits
painted on the skin of his enemies.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:30.002
My forefathers perfected this technique.

01:16:30.102 --> 01:16:33.505
There was no greater honor.

01:16:33.605 --> 01:16:38.310
These paintings were...

01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:40.245
And are priceless.

01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:47.352
Every frame in this room is
painted on the back of a soul.

01:16:50.322 --> 01:16:52.491
Every soul is selected by the client.

01:16:58.297 --> 01:17:01.433
You sit...

01:17:01.533 --> 01:17:03.936
in a gallery of souls.

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.484
Let's forget this place
and go back to mine and fuck.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.292
How can I help you?

01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:37.102
Yeah. Um...

01:17:37.202 --> 01:17:39.504
She wants her clit pierced.
Can you make that happen?

01:17:39.604 --> 01:17:42.007
Sure, I can make that happen.

01:17:42.107 --> 01:17:44.142
And I was supposed
to meet some friends here.

01:17:44.242 --> 01:17:46.912
Um, have you seen them?

01:17:47.012 --> 01:17:50.349
Yeah. They're downstairs
having a couple of drinks.

01:17:50.449 --> 01:17:53.151
You wanna join them,
you're more than welcome.

01:17:53.251 --> 01:17:57.356
And you will come with me.

01:17:57.456 --> 01:17:59.591
Great.

01:17:59.691 --> 01:18:01.493
Hurry up, Jesse.

01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:06.298
Have fun.

01:18:06.398 --> 01:18:10.469
Put your jacket in here
and come sit on the table.

01:18:42.334 --> 01:18:44.569
It's an interesting choice.

01:18:48.573 --> 01:18:50.108
How bad is this gonna hurt?

01:18:50.208 --> 01:18:53.578
You know, when I did mine I had an orgasm.

01:18:54.828 --> 01:18:57.532
Whatever. Just get it over and done with.

01:18:59.084 --> 01:19:00.585
I'll count to three.

01:19:00.685 --> 01:19:03.455
Oh!

01:19:12.731 --> 01:19:14.099
Here we go.

01:19:14.199 --> 01:19:17.436
- One...
- Ow! Fuck!

01:19:17.536 --> 01:19:21.006
What happened to "count to three,"
you crazy bitch?

01:19:21.706 --> 01:19:23.675
- Fuck!
- I forget.

01:19:23.775 --> 01:19:26.979
Can I get an ice pack or something?

01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:29.081
I'll get you one.

01:19:45.173 --> 01:19:47.274
What the fuck?

01:19:50.044 --> 01:19:52.480
Where the fuck are my clothes, bitch?

01:20:25.133 --> 01:20:28.169
Oh, fuck! Holy...

01:20:28.269 --> 01:20:30.005
Hang in there, buddy.

01:20:30.105 --> 01:20:32.474
I'm gonna get you down.

01:20:32.574 --> 01:20:34.342
What is it? What is it?

01:20:35.985 --> 01:20:37.746
Help... help Amy.

01:20:37.846 --> 01:20:40.548
- Help...
- Fuck!

01:20:42.584 --> 01:20:44.185
Ok...

01:20:44.285 --> 01:20:47.188
Fuck. I'll be back. I'll be back.

01:21:26.327 --> 01:21:28.864
Oh, my God, Amy. Amy, fuck, you're alive.

01:21:28.964 --> 01:21:31.366
- Jesse?
- What the fuck happened to your face?

01:21:31.466 --> 01:21:35.103
What are you doing here?
You have to go! You have to go now! Go!

01:21:35.203 --> 01:21:38.073
Antonas, nice of you to join us.

01:21:38.173 --> 01:21:42.143
Antonas? Jesse, Jesse, run!

01:21:42.243 --> 01:21:45.280
- This wasn't the deal.
- Deal?

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:46.448
What deal?

01:21:48.283 --> 01:21:52.721
I swear, it wasn't
supposed to be this way, Amy.

01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:54.589
Only Brock.

01:21:54.689 --> 01:21:59.561
I told you not to fucking go with him
when we were at my house.

01:21:59.661 --> 01:22:00.996
Fuck.

01:22:01.096 --> 01:22:04.099
What do you mean, "my house"?

01:22:04.199 --> 01:22:06.001
What are you talking about?

01:22:06.101 --> 01:22:08.169
Amy,

01:22:08.269 --> 01:22:09.671
you still don't know, do you?

01:22:09.771 --> 01:22:12.240
Shut your fucking mouth.

01:22:14.175 --> 01:22:16.411
Antonas's family,

01:22:16.511 --> 01:22:19.047
the Cuzas,

01:22:19.147 --> 01:22:21.716
have been my family's clients
for centuries.

01:22:45.473 --> 01:22:48.643
My dad is gonna shit when he sees this.

01:22:49.978 --> 01:22:51.546
Fucking awesome.

01:22:53.848 --> 01:22:56.217
Hey, so now what?

01:22:56.317 --> 01:22:58.820
You take the painting and you leave.

01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.489
That's how our arrangement works.

01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:05.827
But she knows about me.

01:23:05.927 --> 01:23:09.631
That's none of your concern.

01:23:09.731 --> 01:23:11.666
None of my concern?

01:23:11.766 --> 01:23:14.135
You need to get rid of her,
you fucking idiot.

01:23:14.235 --> 01:23:17.372
What? Fuck you, Jesse!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

01:23:17.472 --> 01:23:21.109
Yeah? Good luck. Oh, nice tattoo, freak.

01:23:21.209 --> 01:23:23.645
Fuck you!

01:23:23.745 --> 01:23:25.380
Let's all take it easy.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:27.248
She's not going anywhere.

01:23:27.348 --> 01:23:30.118
We'll see what my dad says about that.

01:23:30.218 --> 01:23:32.720
You know what? Fuck this.
You're done, bro.

01:23:40.895 --> 01:23:44.132
What the fuck?

01:23:44.232 --> 01:23:47.202
What the fuck, dude?

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.641
Amy...

01:23:57.879 --> 01:24:01.749
now it is time for you
to seize your true destiny.

01:24:06.254 --> 01:24:08.423
What?

01:24:08.523 --> 01:24:11.860
- I... I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.695
And you will.

01:24:24.372 --> 01:24:27.242
Jesse's fate is in your hands now.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:26.922
I wonder if your head will come off.

01:25:27.772 --> 01:25:29.133
Hey!

01:26:48.103 --> 01:26:50.739
What the fuck?

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:55.143
What the fuck?

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:57.546
What the fuck?

01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:16.865
What the fuck?

01:27:19.134 --> 01:27:21.636
Oh, thank God, Amy.

01:27:21.736 --> 01:27:25.907
Get me out of here, quick,
before he comes back.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:28.109
Hurry up!

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:32.714
Why did you set us up?

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:34.749
Why would you do this?

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:37.152
You fucking nuts?
Get me out of here before he gets back!

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.588
Why?

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:42.123
I never wanted any of this.

01:27:43.123 --> 01:27:45.927
I was told to get someone I knew.

01:27:46.027 --> 01:27:48.797
It's a family tradition.

01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:50.699
My dad put me up to it, ok?

01:27:50.799 --> 01:27:53.869
My family has a lot of money

01:27:53.969 --> 01:27:56.638
and a lot of power in this country.

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:58.974
You do what you're told!
You don't ask questions!

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:02.244
Listen. Just give me the painting.

01:28:02.344 --> 01:28:06.248
Let me get out of here,
and I'll make you a very wealthy girl.

01:28:06.348 --> 01:28:09.885
Does it look like I do anything for money?

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:15.023
Besides, your back is perfectly clean.

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:17.125
What, are you fucking nuts?

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:22.631
No! No!

01:28:57.374 --> 01:29:00.077
Watch it. Dude, man.

01:29:00.627 --> 01:29:03.897
Hey, bro. Can I get a tattoo?

01:29:12.705 --> 01:29:16.927
Hey, guys. Take a seat. The Artist
will be with you in just a second.

01:29:17.027 --> 01:29:19.563
