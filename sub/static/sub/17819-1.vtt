00:56.118 --> 01:01.884
<i>...but first here with the highlights of the latest news...
8 a.m. Eastern War Time... September 14th.</i>

01:02.119 --> 01:04.919
<i>When the 5th Army advanced to the Gulf of Salerno in Italy...</i>

01:04.921 --> 01:07.336
<i>...extremely heavy fighting continues.</i>

01:07.380 --> 01:10.139
<i>The Germans are using tanks
and elements of three divisions</i>

01:10.161 --> 01:12.969
<i>with Hermann Goering
and the 15th and 16th Panzers.</i>

01:13.060 --> 01:18.077
<i>At one or two points they have regained some
of the ground taken from them in the last day or two,</i>

01:18.080 --> 01:22.689
<i>but the powerful Allied Forces receiving
a steady stream of reinforcements and supplies,</i>

01:22.690 --> 01:26.481
<i>are advancing steadily to gain the foothills
arcing around the coastal plain...</i>

01:26.482 --> 01:27.881
<i>...that we made our landing.</i>

01:27.933 --> 01:30.679
<i>We have firmly established
ourselves in the coastal area,</i>

01:30.686 --> 01:33.438
<i>but as long as German artillery
in place in the foothills...</i>

01:33.753 --> 01:35.461
Come on, James, get some sleep.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.090
We MIGHT have missed something.

01:40.427 --> 01:43.594
A thousand triple checks and
we might have missed something?

01:43.805 --> 01:46.379
James, tomorrow we make history!

01:47.518 --> 01:48.846
See you in the morning.

01:49.347 --> 01:52.062
<i>...back yesterday, which gives a clear picture of the fighting.</i>

01:52.263 --> 01:56.124
<i>Details of an American unit which advanced,
knocking-out 12 enemy tanks...</i>

01:56.125 --> 01:58.702
<i>...the projected backup
is a German counterattack</i>

01:58.768 --> 02:02.009
<i>overrunning one of our observation
posts with several war tanks.</i>

02:02.310 --> 02:04.686
<i>Enemy fighters, approximately a hundred and twenty are...</i>

02:32.063 --> 02:34.636
I really have to talk to you about your friend.

02:44.117 --> 02:46.423
Would you stop that!

02:46.495 --> 02:48.867
What kind of girl do you think I am?

02:49.081 --> 02:53.577
I figured you're the kind that understands
that this might be my last dance.

02:53.961 --> 02:56.534
That's a lot of malarkey and you know it.

02:56.755 --> 03:01.251
All you're doing is taking a joy-ride around the harbor
and getting out of the war for six months.

03:01.363 --> 03:03.835
Isn't that a great excuse though?

03:10.269 --> 03:13.435
We're not going back to the office and that's final.

03:23.824 --> 03:26.368
- Take care of junior for me.
- Okay.

03:34.189 --> 03:36.203
That's more my speed!

03:37.130 --> 03:40.131
How do you fell about an old,
married man who's raring to go?

03:40.132 --> 03:41.090
Sure!

03:41.127 --> 03:42.832
- Hey, is it okay?
- No, it's not.

03:42.907 --> 03:46.884
- C'mon. Hey, Babe, you wanna cut a rug.
- Why not?

03:56.129 --> 03:58.645
- Motherhood suits ya.
- Is that a compliment?

03:58.860 --> 04:01.896
Yes, it's supposed to.
Jimmy's a lucky guy.

04:02.196 --> 04:04.154
Well, you had your chance.

04:04.991 --> 04:06.865
Yeah, I guess I did.

04:09.496 --> 04:10.330
Want something to drink?

04:10.873 --> 04:12.076
A Coke.

04:19.755 --> 04:21.298
Give me a beer and a Coke.

04:22.259 --> 04:23.919
Hey, there goes the Whiz Kid.

04:25.129 --> 04:27.112
<i>He doesn't look too happy, does he?</i>

04:28.224 --> 04:30.217
Maybe he knows somethin' we don't.

04:30.518 --> 04:32.226
Thanks, Steve, that's just what I wanted to hear.

04:32.478 --> 04:37.384
- Hey, uh, how's it going with Doris?
- None of your business.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.375
When are you going to California?

04:55.585 --> 04:59.582
Tomorrow. Since you're gonna be quarantined
for a month, there's no use in my staying.

04:59.714 --> 05:02.880
Yeah.. hey, say hello to everybody for me, all right?

05:03.093 --> 05:05.861
I will. Have you heard from your dad?

05:07.619 --> 05:12.508
No. He's up at Sacramento. He's not gonna
let the war get in the way of his racing.

05:15.856 --> 05:18.264
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this'll be the last dance.</i>

05:18.734 --> 05:20.557
- What?
- The last dance!

05:21.565 --> 05:22.380
See ya, Babe.

05:24.698 --> 05:27.505
- Look after Jimmy for me, will ya?
- Yeah.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.891
Come on, Honey, it's the last dance.

07:16.392 --> 07:19.141
Pam! Davy, look, it's Pam!

07:19.350 --> 07:22.322
Hi, Pam! I hear the baby!

07:22.987 --> 07:27.756
Hi! Hi!
- I love you, Sweetie! I love you! I'll miss you.

07:27.984 --> 07:30.128
I love you!

08:48.366 --> 08:49.907
You worried about losing your job, Joe?

08:50.868 --> 08:53.245
I'll believe it when I see him do it.

08:53.705 --> 08:56.492
Well, we'll find out soon enough.

09:10.054 --> 09:12.094
You fellas goin' on another joy-ride?

09:12.307 --> 09:16.588
Hey, Smitty, I heard your old lady ran off with a Skimmer Puke.

09:16.603 --> 09:20.043
- I heard it was an Airedale.
- I heard it was both of 'em!

09:27.031 --> 09:29.604
Well, we get to go out
without Pam tonight, hotshot!

09:29.825 --> 09:33.472
- Yeah, we'll be in quarantine's time tonight.
- Forget quarantine!

09:33.663 --> 09:36.109
- I got it all worked out, buddy.
- Yeah?

09:58.438 --> 10:01.428
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Sir.

10:02.442 --> 10:04.443
- Is everything in order?
- Yes, Sir.

10:04.611 --> 10:06.963
Have you checked the communications link to the shore?

10:07.134 --> 10:09.284
Yes, Sir! Clear as a bell!

10:09.845 --> 10:17.491
<i>Now hear this: All visitors prepare to disembark,
except for special sea detail. Prepare to get underway!</i>

10:19.126 --> 10:22.374
- What the hell was that all about?
- I don't know.

10:45.862 --> 10:49.563
<i>Range 2000 yards</i>, bearing 1-2-8.

10:49.782 --> 10:53.699
- No way they're gonna hide this turkey!
- Now you see it, now you don't.

10:53.828 --> 10:56.284
All right, Men, let's concentrate!

11:07.152 --> 11:12.679
<i>Now here this: Secure the specialty
and anchor detail, set the underway watch.</i>

11:12.681 --> 11:15.599
<i>Experimental detail, prepare for the Rainbow One.</i>

11:15.809 --> 11:18.208
<i>The smoking lamp is out throughout the ship.</i>

11:33.911 --> 11:37.112
Hey, Joe, you've met
Dr. Longstreet and his assistant?

11:37.331 --> 11:38.342
Welcome aboard, Sir.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.376
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

11:42.252 --> 11:44.411
The ships are on-station, Sir.

11:53.181 --> 11:55.138
You can start the generators now, Captain.

11:55.350 --> 11:56.760
Commence operations.

11:56.872 --> 11:59.893
This is Sea Dog <i> to Small Boy,
activate Rainbow One.</i>

12:00.772 --> 12:02.848
<i>This is Small Boy, roger, out.</i>

12:03.984 --> 12:06.934
<i>- All sections, stand-by for countdown.</i>
- Here we go!

12:23.421 --> 12:28.380
- Generators activated, Sir.
- Power to the main field.

13:10.761 --> 13:12.448
I don't believe this!

13:14.973 --> 13:17.150
The Eldridge is beginning to fade, Sir!

13:20.625 --> 13:22.032
<i>She's gone!</i>

13:24.525 --> 13:26.856
<i>I didn't think it was</i> possible.

13:27.361 --> 13:30.166
- She's radar invisible!
<i>- Congratulations, Doctor!</i>

13:30.365 --> 13:33.982
Looks like you've just taken
<i>the entire German fleet out of this war.</i>

13:50.092 --> 13:53.378
- How is it?
- It's gettin' kinda spooky in here!

13:54.001 --> 13:54.002
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

14:13.659 --> 14:18.634
Captain Robertson, Sir, it's the cutter.
They say that the Eldridge has vanished!

14:18.670 --> 14:20.365
Of course she has, she's radar invisible!

14:20.520 --> 14:22.412
No, Sir, she's REALLY vanished!

14:22.627 --> 14:23.622
She's gone!

14:23.836 --> 14:25.995
Get me the captain of the Eldridge
on the radio right away!

14:26.214 --> 14:27.458
It's impossible!

14:27.947 --> 14:30.711
<i>Small Boy this is Sea Dog, over.</i>

14:31.737 --> 14:33.853
<i>Small Boy this is Sea Dog.</i>

14:34.096 --> 14:35.197
Shut that down!

14:36.056 --> 14:38.512
Tell the others to kill the generators.
TELL 'EM!!!

14:38.726 --> 14:41.893
- They've broken-off communications, Sir.
- Keep trying.

14:44.315 --> 14:47.652
<i>Attention all the search
and rescue personnel, stand-by!</i>

14:48.266 --> 14:51.185
<i>Repeat, all search and rescue personnel, stand-by!</i>

14:58.079 --> 14:59.656
What is going on here?

15:01.916 --> 15:04.917
- What is it?
- Shut the damn thing... shut it down!

15:11.114 --> 15:14.438
- Jimmy! Are you okay?
- I'm okay! Get outta here!

15:14.474 --> 15:15.591
Let get the hell outta here!

15:23.231 --> 15:24.559
C'mon! Get up!

15:51.467 --> 15:53.092
What is this? What's goin' on?

15:53.303 --> 15:58.157
- I don't know, what do you see right now?
- The stars, the moon, it's night!

15:58.308 --> 16:00.597
Did you see the ship? I mean did...
you see the ship, the town?

16:00.810 --> 16:04.096
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's spinnin' around!
What's goin' on here?

16:04.856 --> 16:08.834
- What about your hand?
- It looks okay now, there's nothing wrong with it.

16:14.053 --> 16:17.031
- What the hell is it?
- I don't know... what is that?

16:27.337 --> 16:29.164
<i>It's comin' back again, Davy!</i>

16:32.389 --> 16:34.368
Oh, my god.

16:36.638 --> 16:37.596
C'mon!

16:39.401 --> 16:40.358
Run!

16:41.381 --> 16:42.741
Run! Run!

17:10.965 --> 17:13.509
Let go, Jimmy! Let go!

17:18.787 --> 17:21.508
We gotta get outta here!
C'mon! Run!

18:02.853 --> 18:05.448
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

18:05.564 --> 18:07.413
- It's the last one.
- Thanks.

18:08.233 --> 18:11.077
- You have any more brilliant ideas?
- Yeah.

18:11.903 --> 18:16.067
We're still in Philadelphia.
This is all part of the experiment.

18:16.283 --> 18:18.193
They did something to our minds!

18:18.452 --> 18:23.515
- There's no desert in Philly.
- Maybe all this isn't real.

18:23.665 --> 18:27.116
Maybe it's a hallucination,
they could've hypnotized us.

18:27.335 --> 18:28.830
Ya know, they do that to people, ya know?

18:28.941 --> 18:33.293
You're tellin' me this is my imagination?
And we're not freezin' our asses off out here?

18:33.509 --> 18:35.418
And they didn't try to kill us last night?

18:35.636 --> 18:39.052
They wouldn't do that!
It's all part of the experiment.

18:39.264 --> 18:41.720
You think the Navy
knows what they're doing?

18:41.934 --> 18:46.975
You saw the guys on the boat. This wasn't
supposed to happen, Jimmy! This is a BIG mistake.

18:47.106 --> 18:51.601
- So what do we do, huh?
- Let's keep on goin'.

18:55.699 --> 19:02.345
- Isn't that water up ahead?
- No, this is a desert, and that's a mirage.

19:16.053 --> 19:19.053
How much longer do you think
this mirage is gonna last?

19:28.607 --> 19:31.098
- What is it?
- Some sorta beer.

19:34.613 --> 19:35.609
German!

19:38.666 --> 19:39.389
Hey!

19:43.706 --> 19:45.165
Coca-cola!

19:45.979 --> 19:49.950
Oh, it's so light!
What the hell's it made of?

19:51.881 --> 19:53.840
Well, hell if I know.

20:04.227 --> 20:07.181
- What is it?
- It's an old Chevy.

20:10.024 --> 20:13.126
<i>It's headin' right for us.</i>
- C'mon!

20:25.791 --> 20:27.415
What the hell was that?

20:39.846 --> 20:43.512
<i>Red Leader to Dry Wells Base,
we don't see any town site.</i>

20:43.726 --> 20:45.766
<i>Dry Wells Base to Red Leader,
repeat!</i>

20:45.978 --> 20:49.892
<i>It was there before the experiment,
it's got to be there now! Keep looking!</i>

20:49.961 --> 20:54.958
<i>How could the damn town just disappear?
Continuing search, over.</i>

21:06.604 --> 21:10.580
That's Longstreet now, punch-up code 84
and run another check of the area.

21:30.482 --> 21:32.474
We just finished our first run.

21:32.693 --> 21:35.813
There's nothing, no anomalous electromagnetic fields.

21:36.030 --> 21:38.022
No heat build-up, no radiation.

21:38.240 --> 21:41.241
The whole damned town just
disappeared, James!

21:41.452 --> 21:42.781
Run a second check.

21:43.204 --> 21:47.665
We are already doing it, but, I mean,
how the hell could this thing have happened?

21:48.793 --> 21:52.375
I don't want Washington involved... not yet.

21:52.672 --> 21:57.064
I understand.
We'll be through in an hour.

22:12.483 --> 22:15.319
All right, I want a shot here and then I want
a shot featuring that section down there.

22:15.528 --> 22:17.901
And then I want a wide shot of the whole assembly.

22:19.865 --> 22:20.862
What is it?

22:22.410 --> 22:26.788
We don't know, Sir, but it wasn't here
when we started, that's for DAMN sure.

22:27.708 --> 22:29.996
The chopper went down
over there by the security fence.

22:30.032 --> 22:31.997
There's not a piece of it left
that's bigger than a matchstick.

22:32.337 --> 22:34.460
How about the security breach?

22:35.549 --> 22:38.674
CQ's checking into it, but I can
guarantee you it's a mistake.

22:38.886 --> 22:41.424
Not even a jack rabbit could get through this perimeter.

22:41.738 --> 22:43.264
Excuse me, Sir.

22:43.995 --> 22:44.792
Clark here.

22:44.826 --> 22:48.492
<i>- We got somethin' for ya.</i>
- Right! Griffin! Let's go!

22:49.230 --> 22:55.168
Three-eighths, it's hard steel coil,
haven't seen anything like it in at least 30 years!

23:04.183 --> 23:08.409
If I was back in Missouri, I'd swear
there was a tornado brewing-up there.

23:56.758 --> 23:58.894
Hey, man, what's happening?

24:08.894 --> 24:12.396
- You comin' in, or what?
- Yeah.

24:38.300 --> 24:40.497
<i>You boys want some coffee?</i>

24:42.303 --> 24:43.779
Yes.

24:44.973 --> 24:47.369
We got a special on the ham and eggs.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.815
Yeah, sounds good.

24:56.361 --> 24:59.414
- Yeah, me, too.
- How do you want the eggs?

25:00.198 --> 25:04.196
- Scrambled.
- Two specials, scrambled!

25:04.201 --> 25:06.267
At least she speaks English.

25:06.662 --> 25:07.697
You don't mind?

25:10.792 --> 25:13.709
- Wha... what... what's the name of this place?
- Scotty's Junction.

25:13.920 --> 25:16.541
You won't find it on any map, I can tell ya' that!

25:17.924 --> 25:19.252
Nevada?

25:20.260 --> 25:22.716
You boys don't know what state you're in?

25:23.888 --> 25:26.997
Yeah, there's a... there's a navy base around here?

25:27.037 --> 25:30.386
<i>Not that I know of.</i>
Just the base up at Dry Wells.

25:31.001 --> 25:31.002
These are by δΘΣτΘP⌠ß⌠Θ which is Greek to me.

25:32.105 --> 25:33.477
That's it!

25:34.962 --> 25:38.940
- Do you have a phone?
- Outside, by the pump.

25:39.196 --> 25:42.481
Give me some of that money,
see if I can get a hold of Base.

26:03.950 --> 26:05.426
What?

26:06.932 --> 26:09.347
You gave the job to somebody else?

26:10.770 --> 26:16.410
I... I did call! I called from Chicago, I called
from Salt Lake! Didn't he get the message?

26:17.026 --> 26:21.269
I don't think you understand!
I quit my job to come work for you.

26:21.800 --> 26:25.524
Of course I'm upset!
I've been driving for two days!

26:27.162 --> 26:30.215
No, I don't wanna come stay with you.

26:30.916 --> 26:33.324
What for?
There's nothing to talk about.

26:33.544 --> 26:37.527
Look, there's someone waiting for the phone... goodbye.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.548
Thank you.

26:55.838 --> 26:59.524
Operator, yes, I want to call long distance, Philadelphia.

27:00.111 --> 27:02.069
United States Naval Base.

27:02.865 --> 27:07.368
Well, yeah, I gotta reverse the charges,
this is Seaman First Class David Herdeg.

27:07.369 --> 27:09.156
Want a Commander Robertson.

27:18.089 --> 27:20.040
<i>- How are your victuals, Sir.
- Hey, Ben!</i>

27:24.387 --> 27:26.380
<i>You got any Sweet 'n' Low?</i>

27:30.143 --> 27:31.851
The Sweet 'n' Low.

27:32.938 --> 27:35.748
- Don't take any checks or credit cards.
- Thanks.

27:57.410 --> 28:01.842
<i>Hey!</i> What in the hell do you think you're doing?

28:03.344 --> 28:05.280
C'mon back here, boy!

28:05.992 --> 28:08.205
- We gotta get outta here, Davy.
- What's goin' on?

28:08.242 --> 28:09.908
All right, hold it right there, boy!

28:10.058 --> 28:12.936
Now, you're paying for both them machines
before you leave my place.

28:12.973 --> 28:14.278
I didn't do anything to your machines!

28:14.415 --> 28:16.323
Mister, I don't know
what you're talkin' about...

28:16.324 --> 28:18.231
You shut up, or I'll blow your head off, too.

28:18.443 --> 28:20.797
- Pa, I already called the Sheriff.
- Now, you just get back inside.

28:21.008 --> 28:23.635
All right, stay back! Everybody! Stay back!

28:23.671 --> 28:25.351
- Easy, Mister! C'mon, take it easy.
<i>- Get back!</i>

28:25.388 --> 28:26.955
- Get in the car, Jimmy.
- I didn't do anything, Davy.

28:26.991 --> 28:28.403
Just get in the car!

28:33.229 --> 28:35.474
Stay back, just stay back, we'll get 'em later.

28:36.211 --> 28:37.491
Where are the keys?

28:37.712 --> 28:39.869
It's everything I own,
could you take another car?

28:39.905 --> 28:41.376
Just give me the damn keys!

28:50.810 --> 28:52.601
What's the matter?!?

28:53.333 --> 28:56.274
- Where the hell's the clutch?
- It's automatic!

28:56.440 --> 28:57.435
<i>What is an "automatic"?</i>

28:57.649 --> 29:01.207
- Get in, you're driving.
- Jesus Christ.

29:01.244 --> 29:02.294
Hey, forget the bag!

29:02.362 --> 29:06.887
- I'm not leaving without my stuff.
- For God's sake, get in the car!

29:09.432 --> 29:12.471
Go! <i>Go! Come on! Go! Go!</i>

29:24.510 --> 29:27.084
Look, I'll cooperate,
but just don't hurt me, okay?

29:27.305 --> 29:30.114
- We're not gonna hurt you, just keep on drivin'.
- Did you get through to the Base.

29:30.225 --> 29:33.149
They never even heard of a Commander
Robertson... that's what they said.

29:33.186 --> 29:35.897
But that's a lie!
Why would they do that?

29:36.106 --> 29:37.304
Let me see that.

29:38.317 --> 29:41.935
It doesn't feel too good, Davey.
It happened again back there.

29:42.154 --> 29:45.883
You know, you should be in the hospital.
He should be in a hospital, you know that!

29:46.742 --> 29:48.182
What's the date?

29:48.286 --> 29:51.300
- The date, it's the 17th.
- The year!

29:51.997 --> 29:54.642
Are you kidding?
It's 1984!

29:56.627 --> 29:58.838
What's going on with you two?
Are you on drugs or something?

29:58.921 --> 30:01.233
- 1984.
- What about the War?

30:01.340 --> 30:03.136
- What war?
- The War!

30:03.172 --> 30:04.123
Vietnam?

30:04.343 --> 30:06.800
World War II,
Germany and Japan!

30:07.304 --> 30:08.550
What about it?

30:09.557 --> 30:10.810
Who won?

30:13.144 --> 30:15.532
We won, what do you think?

30:17.690 --> 30:19.545
Are you guys putting me on or somethin'?

30:21.277 --> 30:24.048
- How far to the next town?
- I don't know.

30:24.155 --> 30:25.711
Hey, do you have any cigarettes?

30:26.074 --> 30:28.150
No, I quit last month.

30:44.867 --> 30:50.300
<i>Roger, one-niner, you're advised
to clear quadrant Delta...</i>

30:50.509 --> 30:54.878
<i>Roger, this is one-niner, we copy,
standing by for base communications.</i>

31:08.305 --> 31:09.106
Good morning, Sir.

31:09.107 --> 31:11.216
- Is Dr. Longstreet down there?
- Yes, he is.

31:26.636 --> 31:29.431
I don't understand any significant
difference between this experiment

31:29.432 --> 31:32.018
and any other anti-missile
test we've run so far.

31:32.019 --> 31:32.945
Larry!

31:34.686 --> 31:38.223
- It wouldn't be enough to do it.
- Of course it would, it's the only variable.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.784
The amount of energy it took to deflect
the missiles into hyperspace was so great

31:41.860 --> 31:43.521
<i>- Look!
- it created a wrinkle in the continuum!</i>

31:43.738 --> 31:46.310
<i>We shut the energy off,
we turned the generators down,</i>

31:46.531 --> 31:48.488
<i>why didn't the town simply re-materialize?</i>

31:48.700 --> 31:51.148
Maybe there is another power source functioning.

31:52.704 --> 31:56.275
- Where?
- Inside the zone, in hyperspace itself.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.789
What would be the possible source?

31:59.002 --> 32:01.448
- Did you get the meteorological report?
- Yes.

32:01.797 --> 32:06.954
It's incredible, it's as if every storm front in the
region were being sucked <i>into this one tiny zone.</i>

32:07.011 --> 32:09.765
<i>We have three separate reports
of tornadoes, and that doesn't happen here.</i>

32:09.802 --> 32:10.863
Where's it centered now?

32:11.455 --> 32:13.875
- Major Clark wants to see you.
<i>- About 40 miles due east of here.</i>

32:14.164 --> 32:15.487
I'll be back.

32:16.187 --> 32:18.165
What other the possible energy source?

32:18.398 --> 32:22.288
I'm sorry to interrupt, but I thought you
should know, there WAS a security break.

32:22.735 --> 32:26.949
At least two men were in the area of the experiment
when it took place, I put out a full alert.

32:27.031 --> 32:29.415
So much for the jack rabbit theory.

32:30.076 --> 32:34.519
- We'll catch them, I can guarantee THAT.
- When you do, I'll want to see them.

34:33.996 --> 34:35.621
Jimmy, look at this!

34:37.165 --> 34:39.449
<i>I don't like it, Davey, it's all wrong.</i>

34:39.583 --> 34:42.458
- PLEASE, can we find a hospital?
- Just keep drivin'.

34:42.495 --> 34:45.563
- We can't, Davey.
- Then what do you wanna do?

34:45.799 --> 34:49.402
- Let's just try and get home.
- Where's home?

34:51.013 --> 34:52.678
California.

34:53.870 --> 34:55.833
It's comin' back, Davey.

35:04.255 --> 35:07.212
- What the hell is wrong with you two?
- Look out!

35:19.959 --> 35:21.732
All right, nobody move!

35:21.857 --> 35:24.359
<i>Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding!</i>

35:27.217 --> 35:29.968
I need an E.K.G. and get Nielson down here,
it looks like a possible...

35:30.178 --> 35:32.774
All I know he's living
somewhere in California.

35:32.811 --> 35:33.762
- But you don't know where?
- No.

35:33.807 --> 35:37.679
She may be distended on her left proximal
radius and ulna, be back in a few minutes.

35:38.144 --> 35:40.383
Could you sit over here, please,
and take your own coat off.

35:40.397 --> 35:43.267
Ya know, there's nothing wrong with my arm,
it's just a little bit sore.

35:43.275 --> 35:45.690
Let's be on the safe side
and check it out anyway, okay?

35:46.694 --> 35:50.456
When we're finish here, we need you to come
to the station and fill-out a statement.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.327
- What's gonna happen to them?
- Hold still, please.

35:53.363 --> 35:56.487
<i>Kidnapping with a dangerous weapon
carries a minimum of 9 to 12 years.</i>

35:56.705 --> 35:58.324
12 years?

35:59.791 --> 36:02.817
- How are ya?
- Fine.

36:02.920 --> 36:06.089
Did anything unusual happen to you
or the others prior to the accident?

36:06.298 --> 36:07.329
Like what?

36:07.341 --> 36:11.228
Well, did you come in contact with
any radiation or anything like that?

36:13.097 --> 36:17.280
I... I don't know, I mean, the car just,
like, just lit-up before we hit the barricade,

36:17.421 --> 36:20.577
<i>- I don't really know what caused it.</i>
- Turn your arm, please.

36:20.981 --> 36:22.413
Why, what's wrong?

36:22.523 --> 36:25.767
There's a man dying up there and
for the life of me I don't know why.

36:26.778 --> 36:31.332
- Well, why don't you talk to his friend?
- He refuses to talk to anyone.

36:32.909 --> 36:35.830
<i>Don't move, please... thank you.</i>

37:19.186 --> 37:21.687
Would you like a cigarette?

37:22.762 --> 37:24.022
Yeah.

37:33.416 --> 37:35.532
- Thank you.
- Sure.

37:38.768 --> 37:41.219
What the hell are you dressed like that for?

37:43.857 --> 37:45.554
Do you like it?

37:45.972 --> 37:47.223
Herdeg!

37:51.740 --> 37:57.341
<i>Good luck...</i> sailor.

37:57.955 --> 38:01.240
- Now, what do you mean she won't press charges?
- That's what she said.

38:01.458 --> 38:02.621
The old couple?

38:02.835 --> 38:06.038
They don't want to drive into town, said they can't
run their business and be at the court.

38:06.255 --> 38:10.291
Jesus Christ! How do these people expect us to
help them, <i>when they won't help themselves?</i>

38:11.552 --> 38:14.078
No wonder the God damned country's going to hell.

38:17.746 --> 38:19.822
Excuse me, Allison, this is the Sheriff Bates.

38:19.823 --> 38:21.357
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:21.813 --> 38:25.811
I understand you don't want to press
charges anymore? Can you tell me why?

38:26.735 --> 38:29.502
- I changed my mind.
- Just like that?

38:29.570 --> 38:35.058
No particular reason, you just decided
to let the guys get <i>away with kidnapping you?</i>

38:35.535 --> 38:40.492
I just don't think they deserve to go to jail
for 12 years, they have other problems.

38:40.665 --> 38:45.170
We've all got problems, honey,
but we don't solve 'em with guns.

38:48.798 --> 38:50.875
Now, you SURE you won't change your mind?

38:51.593 --> 38:53.136
I'm sure.

38:56.911 --> 38:59.539
You're a lucky sonofabitch, you know that?

39:05.441 --> 39:07.038
Good luck.

39:10.384 --> 39:13.663
- How you doin'?
- Fine.

39:15.201 --> 39:19.702
We haven't actually met yet,
I'm Allison Hayes.

39:20.519 --> 39:22.390
David Herdeg.

39:32.426 --> 39:33.802
How does that feel?

39:33.803 --> 39:40.336
<i>Dr. Cannon to Neuro 1,
Dr. Cannon to Neuro 1 immediately.</i>

39:47.233 --> 39:50.100
Hey, Jimmy, how you doin'?

39:52.618 --> 39:54.093
Davey.

39:56.535 --> 40:00.022
I was having this... dream.

40:02.246 --> 40:07.795
- Pam? <i>Is that... is Pam with you?</i>
- No.

40:11.446 --> 40:14.436
The baby's coming... soon.

40:15.179 --> 40:18.066
She wants it... to be a boy.

40:19.204 --> 40:22.189
<i>She said, "Make it a boy."</i>

40:26.857 --> 40:31.009
Don't leave me, Davey,
I can't go through this again.

40:38.328 --> 40:41.127
I'm sorry, you're going to have to
leave right now, thank you.

40:45.356 --> 40:48.250
- Do we need the doctor?
- No, I think he's gonna be all right.

40:48.359 --> 40:51.303
They can't help him if you
DON'T tell them what happened.

40:56.763 --> 41:00.658
<i>- We were involved in an experiment.
- What kind of an experiment?</i>

41:02.394 --> 41:09.561
It's electronic... deflecting radar so a ship couldn't be
detected at sea... I didn't understand all of it.

41:10.570 --> 41:15.973
You were exposed to an electronic
energy field of some sort?

41:17.538 --> 41:21.860
I think so, but there was something else...
something else happened.

41:23.499 --> 41:28.900
We got caught-up in
this freak thing... just the two of us.

41:30.005 --> 41:33.898
I don't know what it was, but
somehow we got moved in time.

41:34.614 --> 41:36.107
What do you mean?

41:37.471 --> 41:43.888
Time... this now, this time, it's not ours,
we weren't here when it happened.

41:44.145 --> 41:46.850
<i>The experiment took place
on a ship in a Philadelphia Harbor.</i>

41:47.065 --> 41:49.880
It was 1943... October.

41:54.239 --> 41:59.166
Does this sound crazy, ya know,
or is this sort of thing possible now?

42:01.997 --> 42:04.762
What are your memories of 1943?

42:05.208 --> 42:06.993
<i>Are they clear to you?</i>

42:07.753 --> 42:09.208
You think I'm makin' this up?

42:09.296 --> 42:14.433
I didn't say that, I just want you to
describe something in 1943 for me.

42:14.469 --> 42:17.635
I can describe everything!
1943 was yesterday for me!

42:17.638 --> 42:18.741
<i>I'm not doubting you, Mr. Herdeg.</i>

42:18.742 --> 42:21.334
Like hell you're not doubting me,
you don't believe <i>anything I'm sayin'.</i>

42:21.371 --> 42:22.807
David, he's just trying to help.

42:22.852 --> 42:27.202
Hey! Look! I'm not lying! You think I'd make this up?
What the hell would I make it up for?

42:27.578 --> 42:30.710
- Yes.
- Dr. Magnussen, you better come quickly.

42:31.214 --> 42:34.981
- What is it?
- It's the patient in B.

42:36.553 --> 42:38.612
You'll have to excuse me a moment.

42:40.223 --> 42:42.365
That's Jimmy, I know it's Jimmy!

42:52.257 --> 42:54.852
- Give him I.V. valium!
- I've already given him 10 milligrams!

42:54.893 --> 42:55.936
<i>Stand by C.P.R.</i>

42:58.493 --> 43:02.050
- Excuse me, clear the way!
<i>- Come on, let's get that in here.</i>

43:02.823 --> 43:04.757
Clear for the backboard coming in.

43:05.845 --> 43:07.239
Ambu bag coming in.

43:16.990 --> 43:19.279
Try and restrain him so he doesn't hurt himself!

43:19.878 --> 43:22.308
- What the hell is going on here?
- Get some more insulin here.

43:25.833 --> 43:28.336
Get back! Get back! Get back!

43:29.044 --> 43:30.298
Get back.

43:35.468 --> 43:37.500
<i>Don't let anybody touch him!</i>

43:39.899 --> 43:41.264
Oh, my God.

43:47.563 --> 43:50.026
<i>David, what's wrong?</i>

43:50.385 --> 43:54.304
David? David, wait... let me go,
I want to be with him.

43:54.336 --> 43:56.701
<i>Stay away from him, I don't know
what it is, but...</i>

43:56.719 --> 43:58.972
- That's the other one.
- Pick him up!

43:59.601 --> 44:00.660
<i>David?</i>

44:03.476 --> 44:04.756
Where are you going?

44:15.496 --> 44:17.372
- What the heck!
- I got the other elevator.

44:17.373 --> 44:19.052
<i>Security, to 5th floor, stat.</i>

44:19.499 --> 44:22.329
<i>Security, to 5th floor, stat.</i>

44:39.242 --> 44:42.617
- Look, I'm gonna have to take you in.
- I didn't do anything.

44:43.121 --> 44:46.343
- Don't give me any trouble.
- I didn't do anything!

44:46.778 --> 44:48.342
What are you doing?

44:49.280 --> 44:51.470
Look out now! Stop that shit!

45:05.143 --> 45:06.605
There he is!

45:22.056 --> 45:23.276
Aw, shit!

45:37.239 --> 45:38.608
<i>Up the stairs!</i>

45:48.167 --> 45:50.052
Sorry, sorry.

45:50.524 --> 45:52.437
Come on, God damn it, let's go!

46:10.251 --> 46:12.238
What the hell are you
doing, get outta here!

46:12.358 --> 46:15.026
David! David get in!

46:17.008 --> 46:18.943
<i>- Stop him! God damn it, stop him!
- Who are they?</i>

46:18.948 --> 46:20.502
I don't know, just keep goin'.

46:21.288 --> 46:22.554
<i>What happened to Jimmy?</i>

46:22.660 --> 46:26.900
Does it have to do with the experiment? Is it...
is it some kind of secret thing? Is that it?

46:27.311 --> 46:31.229
<i>For God's sake, David, I'm just </i> trying
to understand! I want to help you!

46:31.503 --> 46:34.248
- Do you know where Santa Paula, California is?
- No.

46:35.570 --> 46:37.704
Is your family there, is that it?

46:38.135 --> 46:39.702
They used to be.

46:41.117 --> 46:44.667
I have to go to Los Angeles anyway...
we'll find it.

46:46.248 --> 46:48.454
Why are you doin' all this, Allison?

46:49.792 --> 46:51.584
I don't know.

46:51.628 --> 46:55.705
All that stuff I told the doctor back there,
did you believe it, believe any of it?

46:57.592 --> 46:59.799
I believe that you believe.

47:24.703 --> 47:28.070
- How's your reading?
- I think there's a malfunction.

47:28.124 --> 47:31.771
I keep getting negative pressure
and it keeps dropping, it's impossible.

47:31.836 --> 47:36.091
No, it's pulling the air in,
it's pulling everything in.

47:36.223 --> 47:39.983
<i>- How?</i>
- We opened up a hole, Barney.

47:40.408 --> 47:44.312
We opened it up and it stayed open.

47:47.227 --> 47:53.360
My God, you can feel it,
<i>you can you feel the energy.</i>

48:03.618 --> 48:08.280
<i>What is described as a freakish low pressure
system continues to stall over Nevada,</i>

48:08.519 --> 48:11.997
<i>leaving thousands virtually cut off
from the rest of the world.</i>

48:12.034 --> 48:14.202
<i>With roads closed, power wires down...</i>

48:14.212 --> 48:18.189
<i>...to one hundred fifty miles
an hour have downed major power lines</i>

48:18.219 --> 48:20.497
<i>leaving hundreds of
families without power...</i>

48:20.594 --> 48:24.158
<i>...personal computer from Digital
with two separate microprocessors.</i>

48:24.189 --> 48:26.938
<i>One for today's jobs,
another for tomorrow.</i>

48:26.974 --> 48:32.112
<i>The Rainbow from Digital Equipment Corporation,
call 1-800-DIGITAL for the store nearest you.</i>

48:32.357 --> 48:33.227
<i>Phone!</i>

48:33.441 --> 48:35.731
<i>- What do you want me to answer first?
- Both!</i>

48:35.839 --> 48:38.226
<i>Both of 'em! Both of 'em!</i>

48:39.009 --> 48:41.804
<i>Hold the line please... thank you.</i>

48:57.611 --> 49:02.544
It's unbelievable out there! Oh, I hid the car
around back, we can rent a new one in the morning.

49:04.263 --> 49:06.091
Oh, I see you found an old movie to watch?

49:06.307 --> 49:08.846
Yeah, it's the only thing I seem
to understand around here.

49:11.605 --> 49:15.362
I got you some magazines and
a change of clothes... I hope they fit.

49:15.693 --> 49:19.642
Hey, ya know, I don't know how I'm gonna
be able to pay you back for all this.

49:19.800 --> 49:23.118
Don't worry about it now.
You like Chinese food?

49:23.200 --> 49:26.381
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Enjoy.

49:29.219 --> 49:30.741
Here, dig in.

49:37.840 --> 49:39.345
Are you okay?

49:40.176 --> 49:42.841
What if we get all the way out to Santa Paula, and...

49:43.471 --> 49:47.439
there's nobody left out there left alive that I know?
<i>My father isn't a young man.</i>

49:47.558 --> 49:49.641
Well, let's call, we'll find out.

49:50.458 --> 49:51.856
He doesn't have a phone.

49:53.044 --> 49:55.975
David, everyone has a phone... let's try.

50:06.786 --> 50:10.639
Uh, yes, information please for
Santa Paula, California, the number for...

50:10.686 --> 50:14.095
- John Herdeg.
- John Herdeg, that's H-E-R-D-E-G.

50:14.096 --> 50:15.716
Right, right, right.

50:18.007 --> 50:19.559
Is there any other place?

50:20.509 --> 50:22.601
Try the Parker Ranch, they always had a phone.

50:22.802 --> 50:25.044
Do you have the number for the Parker Ranch?

50:27.231 --> 50:28.560
Thank you.

50:37.005 --> 50:38.529
It's ringing.

50:39.028 --> 50:41.273
But what... what am I gonna say to 'em?

50:42.240 --> 50:45.291
Hello, who's this speaking, please?

50:47.370 --> 50:48.776
Pam?

50:53.127 --> 50:54.331
What happened?

50:54.419 --> 50:57.082
It was her!
It was Jim's wife, Pamela.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.791
Well, why... why did you hang up?

50:58.798 --> 51:01.206
What am I gonna say to her?

51:01.884 --> 51:05.010
Well, that's good, at least
we know she's there.

51:05.012 --> 51:09.761
What if they're there? What if they're waitin' for us?
They know where I'm from, this could all be a trap!

51:10.351 --> 51:13.854
Well... maybe we should tell
the story to someone else

51:13.891 --> 51:16.512
- and get them to come with us.
- Wait, the story you don't believe, right, that one?

51:16.549 --> 51:19.984
David, I don't know what to believe,
how do you know what to believe? Maybe...

51:20.125 --> 51:23.233
maybe they gave you some drugs,
maybe none of this is real at all.

51:23.407 --> 51:27.487
Yeah, maybe none of this is real.
Hey! Maybe this isn't real, right?

51:27.703 --> 51:30.236
Maybe this isn't real! I mean, maybe this
isn't real, maybe none of this is real!

51:30.247 --> 51:31.907
Maybe I'm not real!
Maybe you're not real!

51:32.124 --> 51:33.405
How about that?

51:40.174 --> 51:41.585
Look...

51:42.030 --> 51:44.906
All right, ya know, I don't think
I can really help you anymore,

51:44.907 --> 51:48.930
I think you gotta go through
this, ya know, by yourself, and...

51:49.434 --> 51:55.186
I'm sure you're gonna be fine, but,
ya know, I'm scared, too, so, I'll see ya later, okay?

52:00.966 --> 52:04.039
Wait... please.

52:05.409 --> 52:08.391
Look, I'm sorry, Allison.

52:10.288 --> 52:12.360
I didn't mean to hurt you.

52:14.793 --> 52:16.802
<i>Please stay with me.</i>

52:19.089 --> 52:20.500
I need you.

52:23.497 --> 52:25.061
<i>Please.</i>

53:15.564 --> 53:20.670
I can't believe this, Germany and Japan
are our friends, and Russia's the enemy now?

53:20.757 --> 53:23.540
- Aren't you getting tired, David?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

53:23.541 --> 53:26.706
<i>Alarm set, six thirty a.m.</i>

53:27.910 --> 53:31.726
- Well, don't stay up too late, okay?
- Okay.

53:31.796 --> 53:33.379
G'night.

53:34.612 --> 53:35.585
G'night.

53:35.685 --> 53:39.490
<i>But we just know that every time they do
an experiment around here, the weather changes.</i>

53:42.758 --> 53:46.258
<i>They're responsible for everything
that's goin' on around here.</i>

53:48.535 --> 53:50.601
<i>We tried to contact
Dr. James Longstreet,</i>

53:50.640 --> 53:53.996
<i>who is in charge of experiments
here at the Base, but unfortunately</i>

53:54.061 --> 53:56.694
<i>- he's unavailable for comment.</i>
- What was that name she just said?

53:56.821 --> 53:59.115
- What?
<i>Thanks for your report, Margaret, we'll be</i>

53:59.192 --> 54:01.764
<i>standing by for future developments.</i>
Nothing, never mind.

54:01.974 --> 54:07.190
<i>- And now moving to the national...
- ...in Hollywood once, who refused to hire his director,</i>

54:07.227 --> 54:10.409
<i>in the picture they refused to hire
the director before it turned out to be a failure.</i>

54:10.579 --> 54:12.105
<i>The next time the director's name came up</i>
- Allison!

54:12.106 --> 54:14.400
<i>- the producer said, no, he was</i>
- What?

54:14.548 --> 54:16.932
I know this guy!
Is this another movie?

54:18.545 --> 54:22.003
No, David, this is not a movie.

54:35.257 --> 54:45.736
<i>Twelve forty-six a.m., Twelve forty-six a.m.,
Twelve forty-six a.m.</i>

54:47.616 --> 54:48.904
Sorry.

54:51.461 --> 54:52.816
G'night.

55:20.484 --> 55:22.725
It almost seems connected
to something in this area.

55:22.945 --> 55:26.086
It hasn't moved more than 50 miles
from the original test site, since...

55:26.198 --> 55:27.775
Where is it now?

55:28.680 --> 55:30.652
- Standby!
- B quadrant.

55:30.689 --> 55:33.095
- Moving this way again.
- Destabilizing.

55:34.290 --> 55:36.770
<i>Cameras moving into position now, Sir.</i>

56:01.859 --> 56:03.188
<i>Launch ready.</i>

56:03.570 --> 56:05.437
Cameras mounted and ready, Sir.

56:05.473 --> 56:10.822
- Okay, let's see what the hell we got in there.
- This is control, commence operations.

56:19.127 --> 56:20.922
<i>Sequence activated.</i>

56:25.801 --> 56:28.466
<i>Launch complete,
fifteen hundred and twenty.</i>

56:28.749 --> 56:29.791
<i>Twelve hundred.</i>

56:30.278 --> 56:33.173
<i>9, 8, 7,</i>

56:33.546 --> 56:36.366
<i>6, 5, 4,</i>

56:36.416 --> 56:40.796
<i>3, 2, 1.</i>
We're in.

56:46.697 --> 56:49.064
- Good God, there it is!
<i>- What is that?</i>

56:49.065 --> 56:50.811
<i>It's the town.</i>

56:53.601 --> 56:56.949
<i>- What the hell! - Is that a ship?
- What's a ship doing in there?</i>

57:03.444 --> 57:05.290
Play it back.

57:09.971 --> 57:12.427
Major Clark from security there?

57:14.101 --> 57:16.266
Let me know as soon as he is, please.

57:19.356 --> 57:21.475
<i>All right, here it comes again.</i>

58:10.074 --> 58:15.000
That job was just an excuse to get to L.A.
It's where I want to go, anyway.

58:15.163 --> 58:17.239
<i>There are a lot of opportunities out there.</i>

58:17.540 --> 58:22.318
You know, I have two diplomas. One from
an art school. I've won a couple of awards.

58:22.337 --> 58:25.023
I'm very well thought of in Cincinnati!

58:26.467 --> 58:27.920
I am!

58:28.594 --> 58:31.210
You're very well thought of here, too.

58:32.348 --> 58:34.839
I just know when I get to L.A.
somethin's gonna work out.

58:35.080 --> 58:36.698
<i>It's gonna be fine.</i>

58:39.187 --> 58:42.190
What pisses me off is that jerk Michael.

58:42.227 --> 58:44.751
<i>I'm usually a good judge of character.</i>

58:45.443 --> 58:48.029
- Does the music bother you?
<i>- No.</i>

58:49.782 --> 58:51.905
What about the rest of life?

58:53.140 --> 58:55.207
<i>Don't you want to get married?</i>

58:55.684 --> 58:57.661
Yeah, if I meet the right guy.

58:57.873 --> 59:00.082
<i>Kids? Don't you want to have kids?</i>

59:00.118 --> 59:02.539
You don't have to be married to do that!

59:03.755 --> 59:06.231
Ah, I'm never gonna agree with that.

59:07.237 --> 59:09.657
- Do you want a Coke?
- Yeah.

59:15.245 --> 59:17.120
How did you do that?

59:23.338 --> 59:25.204
Hey, that's pretty neat.

59:26.278 --> 59:29.572
- Why did you join the Navy?
<i>- You know the old saying:</i>

59:30.178 --> 59:32.270
"A girl in every port."

59:33.806 --> 59:36.976
- Do you like to travel?
- Yeah.

59:37.012 --> 59:38.599
Yeah, me too.

59:39.061 --> 59:41.922
- Do you mind?
- Go ahead.

59:43.837 --> 59:46.539
- That's me.
- Yeah.

59:48.009 --> 59:50.928
<i>- What is that?</i>
- Oh, I think it's a Porsche.

59:51.470 --> 59:53.336
Now that's REALLY me.

01:00:21.889 --> 01:00:24.366
This is the one that disappeared.

01:00:29.939 --> 01:00:31.452
Parker.

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:44.699
Is that the other one?

01:00:46.206 --> 01:00:48.625
Yes, this is the Herdeg.

01:00:51.628 --> 01:00:53.223
<i>That's him.</i>

01:00:54.131 --> 01:00:55.334
Thank you, Doctor.

01:00:55.632 --> 01:00:58.510
I'd like to know more
about what happened to Parker.

01:00:58.594 --> 01:01:01.856
I appreciate your curiosity
but this is not the time.

01:01:01.868 --> 01:01:04.718
- But he's...
My driver will take you back now, Doctor.

01:01:05.893 --> 01:01:08.150
And thank you.

01:01:14.777 --> 01:01:19.521
Herdeg's file, they both lived
in Santa Paula, California.

01:01:23.036 --> 01:01:27.454
- How did you know?
- Major, would you just bring him in, please.

01:01:34.588 --> 01:01:36.040
The latest run.

01:01:36.194 --> 01:01:40.802
The vortex is almost twice the size.
It started pulling at surface matter.

01:01:40.866 --> 01:01:46.459
James, if we don't stop this thing soon,
the whole damned planet's in trouble.

01:01:47.664 --> 01:01:50.296
<i>What the hell are we gonna do?</i>

01:02:04.703 --> 01:02:07.391
That's the church Jimmy got married in.

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:12.210
<i>That's the railroad station... looks good.</i>

01:02:13.171 --> 01:02:16.001
And here we come up to the big tree.

01:02:16.257 --> 01:02:18.901
<i>It must be over a hundred years old by now.</i>

01:02:19.218 --> 01:02:21.268
<i>My name's carved in it somewhere.</i>

01:02:33.149 --> 01:02:35.029
<i>Is that your father's place?</i>

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.226
It's different.

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:43.838
Well, let's get some gas and check it out.

01:03:09.728 --> 01:03:11.856
<i>I'll be right with ya!</i>

01:03:18.988 --> 01:03:22.281
- Now, what can I do for you folks?
- Can you fill it up, please?

01:03:23.159 --> 01:03:25.268
- Unleaded?
- Yeah.

01:03:31.188 --> 01:03:33.763
- Is that him?
- Yes.

01:03:33.991 --> 01:03:35.893
<i>Good looking man.</i>

01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:40.416
That's the car we bought out with us
when we moved from New Jersey.

01:03:43.972 --> 01:03:47.771
- That's you.
<i>- That's right.</i>

01:03:49.227 --> 01:03:53.955
<i>Hey, your car was almost full.</i>
Did you want me to check the oil?

01:03:53.982 --> 01:03:55.440
No, that's okay.

01:03:55.441 --> 01:03:57.942
Do you know what happened to
the guy in these pictures?

01:03:57.978 --> 01:04:00.094
- What, John Herdeg?
- Yeah.

01:04:00.113 --> 01:04:05.067
Well, he was a pretty famous guy,
won a helluva a lot of big races in his time.

01:04:05.118 --> 01:04:09.907
- When was that?
- Oh, I don't know, late '40s, early '50s I guess.

01:04:11.334 --> 01:04:17.510
<i>He moved back East somewhere, that's where most of
the racing circuits are... died a few years ago.</i>

01:04:20.426 --> 01:04:25.208
Your car was <i>almost full...
it's only 4 dollars.</i>

01:04:26.995 --> 01:04:28.517
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:31.737
David?

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:39.437
Thanks.
<i>David!</i>

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.987
- Do you want me to drive?
- No, I'm fine.

01:05:14.961 --> 01:05:16.940
I'm sorry, David.

01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.485
But at least he made it.

01:05:22.197 --> 01:05:27.195
He did what he said he was gonna do
when nobody thought he could, not even me!

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.997
Good for you, Pop.

01:05:33.459 --> 01:05:35.078
Good for you!

01:06:09.371 --> 01:06:13.176
- I shoulda called her again.
- It'll be okay.

01:06:15.294 --> 01:06:17.572
What if she doesn't recognize me?

01:06:18.839 --> 01:06:20.600
We'll just tell her.

01:07:10.601 --> 01:07:12.268
Can you help you?

01:07:12.644 --> 01:07:15.086
- Mrs. Parker?
- Yes.

01:07:15.976 --> 01:07:19.904
- Pamela?
- Yes.

01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:25.071
Don't you know me?
Don't you recognize me?

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:29.517
It's me, it's David.
It's Davey Herdeg.

01:07:32.998 --> 01:07:36.410
- No, it's not, it can't be.
- It's me, Pam.

01:07:39.130 --> 01:07:40.590
Please help me.

01:07:45.679 --> 01:07:48.389
Oh my God, David!

01:07:52.998 --> 01:07:54.870
May we come in?

01:07:55.705 --> 01:07:57.843
Ah... yes.

01:07:58.505 --> 01:08:00.824
I'm Allison.

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:26.511
All of this time he was telling the truth.

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:32.446
All of this time and nobody
would believe him, not even me.

01:08:33.227 --> 01:08:35.796
- Who was telling the truth?
- Jimmy.

01:08:37.148 --> 01:08:39.645
- Then he came back!
- Yes.

01:08:41.778 --> 01:08:43.773
<i>Well, what happened?</i>

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:48.939
Well, nobody would listen to him.
We all believed the Navy,

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.121
and they said he had been
affected by the experiment.

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.453
And the ship and the other guys?

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:59.249
Burned, some of them, some of them died.

01:09:00.026 --> 01:09:02.862
What about me?
What happened to me, Pamela?

01:09:04.093 --> 01:09:06.261
You never came back, David.

01:09:07.179 --> 01:09:09.135
You just never came back...

01:09:11.953 --> 01:09:13.921
'til now.

01:09:24.634 --> 01:09:25.948
Jimmy?

01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:28.832
He still likes to go out there and work.

01:09:35.103 --> 01:09:36.871
I'll be right back.

01:09:39.665 --> 01:09:41.270
<i>Davey!</i>

01:09:42.319 --> 01:09:46.326
- He's not like he used to be.
- I know.

01:10:03.445 --> 01:10:04.616
Jimmy.

01:10:05.009 --> 01:10:07.960
<i>Jimmy, it's me, David.</i>

01:10:10.848 --> 01:10:13.217
I know you recognize me, Jimmy.

01:10:13.601 --> 01:10:17.840
I just want to talk to you about
what... about what happened.

01:10:18.773 --> 01:10:22.289
Now, what's the matter, c'mon,
stop this, I want to talk to you.

01:10:24.883 --> 01:10:27.647
Now, c'mon, talk to me, stop the horse!

01:10:28.429 --> 01:10:30.671
Stop this god damned horse and talk to me, damn it!

01:10:30.786 --> 01:10:33.693
- Leave me alone.
- Just tell me what happened!

01:10:34.643 --> 01:10:36.995
Get him outta here!
Just get him outta here!

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.029
Tell me what happened.
Tell me what happened!

01:10:41.067 --> 01:10:43.442
- What's the matter?
- Jimmy?

01:10:44.049 --> 01:10:46.247
- Jimmy?
- What's happening? What's going on?

01:10:46.284 --> 01:10:48.529
I better go now, I'm afraid he's
going to get sick, please, please go.

01:10:48.742 --> 01:10:50.616
Wait! You can't do this!
You've got to help David!

01:10:50.869 --> 01:10:54.119
He can't go through this again!
Please, please leave him alone!

01:10:58.085 --> 01:11:03.296
- David, are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:11:15.184 --> 01:11:17.812
Why didn't you want to speak with him, Jimmy?

01:11:18.313 --> 01:11:19.938
What for?

01:11:22.567 --> 01:11:25.397
He just wanted you to tell him some things.

01:11:26.384 --> 01:11:28.426
It's better he doesn't know.

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:31.361
Why don't you come sit down?

01:11:35.456 --> 01:11:39.039
I can't go through all that again, Pamela.

01:11:39.877 --> 01:11:41.960
I just can't.

01:11:42.171 --> 01:11:45.796
I know you can't, Jimmy,
I do understand.

01:11:55.518 --> 01:11:58.290
He looks just the same, doesn't he?

01:11:59.314 --> 01:12:01.012
Yes, he does.

01:12:01.274 --> 01:12:05.293
I wish to God it was all over for him.

01:12:19.689 --> 01:12:21.306
I'm goin' back.

01:12:21.733 --> 01:12:26.859
It won't do any good, he's frightened,
he's a sick man, she told me.

01:12:26.925 --> 01:12:28.441
I don't care.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:31.207
David, they thought he was
crazy, they put him in a hospital,

01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.881
do you think he wants to
go through that again?

01:12:34.433 --> 01:12:36.551
All I want to do is talk to him.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:40.658
You already know what happened,
you didn't go back, David.

01:12:41.003 --> 01:12:44.591
What happened to him
is not gonna happen to you.

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:51.982
Oh shod!

01:13:03.316 --> 01:13:05.550
Jesus Christ!

01:13:06.862 --> 01:13:08.484
Slow him down!

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:11.542
Look out!

01:13:15.037 --> 01:13:20.480
<i>- David!</i>
- Get down! Shit! <i>Shit!</i> Shit!

01:13:22.254 --> 01:13:23.634
<i>Keep going!</i>

01:13:30.562 --> 01:13:32.616
<i>Get down! Get down!</i>

01:13:50.537 --> 01:13:52.161
Hang on!

01:14:10.342 --> 01:14:11.757
Look out!

01:14:12.794 --> 01:14:14.945
- Hold on!
<i>- David, stop!</i>

01:14:24.213 --> 01:14:26.272
David, where are you going?

01:14:29.843 --> 01:14:31.675
<i>David, come on!</i>

01:14:32.221 --> 01:14:33.697
Damn it!

01:14:33.814 --> 01:14:36.334
Please, David, let's get out of here!

01:14:39.394 --> 01:14:40.646
Dry Wells.

01:14:40.647 --> 01:14:42.924
- David, we gotta get out of here...
- Dry Wells!

01:14:42.961 --> 01:14:46.145
This is close to the place that me and
Jimmy first came in in the desert.

01:14:46.632 --> 01:14:49.668
Please, David, these are federal documents, let's go.

01:14:49.705 --> 01:14:54.364
This is the guy! This is the guy who was in charge
of the experiment we were in, Dr. James Longstreet!

01:14:54.618 --> 01:14:57.438
All right, get in the car, this guy
will know exactly what's goin' on.

01:14:57.496 --> 01:15:00.914
- David, they're gonna be looking for this car.
- We'll get there some other way.

01:15:08.258 --> 01:15:10.751
Easy on his arm there! Easy! Easy!

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:44.286
We're just crossing the Nevada border.

01:15:47.819 --> 01:15:49.665
What's goin' on, Allison?

01:15:56.641 --> 01:15:58.369
C'mon, what's the matter?

01:16:04.107 --> 01:16:07.245
Why can't you just let it go?

01:16:08.278 --> 01:16:14.974
I mean... we could go away somewhere,
together, just... just you and me.

01:16:14.993 --> 01:16:17.237
Allison, I can't let it go,
I gotta find out!

01:16:17.579 --> 01:16:21.601
Is it worth dying for? It's not worth it.

01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:25.390
It's not worth killing people for.

01:16:25.462 --> 01:16:28.020
THEY were trying to kill US, remember?

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:34.262
Look, if you want to bail-out of
this, ya know, I'll understand.

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:36.744
I don't know what the hell
you're doing here anyway.

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:43.419
No, I don't want to leave you.

01:16:51.009 --> 01:16:54.936
I'm just... I'm just frightened.

01:16:56.786 --> 01:17:00.180
Oh, jeez, come here.

01:18:10.611 --> 01:18:13.172
<i>The canyon's is closed, hold it up right there!</i>

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.342
<i>I said turn around! Turn around!</i>

01:18:29.799 --> 01:18:34.068
<i>Make arroyo, Jack, walk to arroyo, turn around.</i>

01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:39.733
Looks like a road block.

01:18:41.686 --> 01:18:45.306
What is it, David? What? Tell me!

01:18:46.565 --> 01:18:49.765
- It's happening to me now.
- No.

01:18:50.632 --> 01:18:52.707
All right, we gotta get out of here,

01:18:52.744 --> 01:18:55.026
- I gotta find Longstreet now.
- Okay, okay.

01:18:55.032 --> 01:18:57.805
- The storm's front got everything tied-up.
- What's goin' on?

01:18:57.910 --> 01:19:02.167
- The road's blocked 'til the storm's over.
- I've got to be in Salt Lake tomorrow!

01:19:02.248 --> 01:19:06.056
- I guess you just gotta find another way to go.
- Damn!

01:19:08.386 --> 01:19:09.866
What the hell.

01:19:11.049 --> 01:19:12.916
Hey, that's my rig!

01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:16.014
That's my god damned rig!

01:19:17.130 --> 01:19:18.292
David!

01:19:19.336 --> 01:19:21.692
That's my god damned rig!

01:19:24.332 --> 01:19:25.473
<i>What the hell...</i>

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:29.352
That's my damn rig!

01:19:30.193 --> 01:19:33.701
- They'll get 'em at the next roadblock.
- Damn!

01:19:49.776 --> 01:19:52.939
- Must be on your side.
- Yeah.

01:20:01.851 --> 01:20:04.678
- You better wait here.
- No, I'm coming with you.

01:20:27.252 --> 01:20:29.656
<i>Come in, the door's open.</i>

01:20:33.384 --> 01:20:34.926
<i>Drop it over there by the fireplace.</i>

01:20:36.074 --> 01:20:37.507
Oh, I thought you were from the Base.

01:20:37.513 --> 01:20:40.331
- Dr. Longstreet here?
- No, can you help you?

01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:44.416
This is the town! This is place
in the <i>desert I was telling you about.</i>

01:20:44.478 --> 01:20:47.260
<i>This is close to where
Jimmy and I first showed up.</i>

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:49.042
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to leave.

01:20:49.066 --> 01:20:50.624
- Where is Longstreet?
- This is a private residence!

01:20:50.735 --> 01:20:52.401
We're not leavin' 'til we see him.

01:21:00.411 --> 01:21:02.065
Be careful of that, it's loaded!

01:21:02.121 --> 01:21:04.468
- Where is he?
- He's on the base.

01:21:04.505 --> 01:21:07.645
- Take me to him.
- It's a secured area, they'll never let you in.

01:21:07.898 --> 01:21:09.797
We'll see about that!

01:21:27.418 --> 01:21:29.106
- All right, get down.
- You're never gonna make it.

01:21:29.316 --> 01:21:31.153
Shut up and get down!

01:21:33.772 --> 01:21:36.374
Halt! Halt!

01:21:42.307 --> 01:21:45.226
<i>Attention all security personnel breach at gate!</i>

01:21:45.227 --> 01:21:48.058
- All right, where is he?
- The control room.

01:21:48.059 --> 01:21:50.602
<i>Unauthorized vehicle approaching control area.</i>

01:21:55.608 --> 01:21:58.436
Get down! Let go! C'mon, let's go!

01:22:04.289 --> 01:22:05.472
Get down!

01:22:08.043 --> 01:22:09.393
Let's go! C'mon, get out!

01:22:12.417 --> 01:22:16.580
- Come on! Let's go!
- We're not gonna god damned make it!

01:22:22.529 --> 01:22:23.814
David!

01:22:24.352 --> 01:22:27.585
You all right? C'mon, c'mon, move it! Let's go!

01:22:58.199 --> 01:22:59.657
There'll be a guard.

01:22:59.784 --> 01:23:02.152
- Why don't you just let me talk to him.
- Shut up!

01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:13.318
- That's it, sailor.
- I'll blow his head off.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.673
At this point, you'll have to chance that.

01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:18.597
- Put the gun down.
<i>- All right, Major.</i>

01:23:18.634 --> 01:23:20.312
Don't hurt him.

01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:24.493
Let him through.

01:23:37.218 --> 01:23:39.347
What the hell have you done, Longstreet?

01:23:44.142 --> 01:23:46.370
Replay the probe.

01:23:55.883 --> 01:24:02.025
Recognize 'em? Your ship and
our town... trapped together?

01:24:02.702 --> 01:24:05.325
- How did it happen?
- We don't know exactly.

01:24:05.361 --> 01:24:11.124
But somehow the electromagnetic fields created
in two experiments, one in 1943 and the other now...

01:24:11.265 --> 01:24:18.075
cross-connected, they created a vortex, a hole in
the space-time continuum, and you fell through it.

01:24:19.366 --> 01:24:21.013
What the hell are you talking about?

01:24:21.326 --> 01:24:25.267
In 1943, when the Eldridge
came back, the hole closed behind it.

01:24:25.351 --> 01:24:30.904
This time it stayed open... it's like... it's like
a giant vacuum, sucking everything into it.

01:24:31.045 --> 01:24:34.185
Now, we can't stop it, but I believe that you can.

01:24:34.221 --> 01:24:36.750
- How?
- Don't listen to him, David.

01:24:38.815 --> 01:24:43.546
The source of energy explosion in the vortex
is the generators on the Eldridge.

01:24:44.203 --> 01:24:46.760
You have to go back
and shut them down, David.

01:24:46.935 --> 01:24:50.706
- I'm not doin' anything for you.
- I'm afraid you've no alternative.

01:24:51.398 --> 01:24:54.453
You see, in the very real sense,
you've already done it.

01:24:54.610 --> 01:24:58.177
You see, when I interviewed the survivors
of the Eldridge, they told me that

01:24:58.213 --> 01:25:00.056
you were the one that
shut down the generators.

01:25:00.074 --> 01:25:03.100
- But I didn't.
- Not yet.

01:25:03.136 --> 01:25:05.793
But we know that eventually you will.

01:25:06.456 --> 01:25:10.765
You're still multiply-connected, David.
Your hand.

01:25:10.877 --> 01:25:16.838
The molecules still drift. As long as that
hole stays open, you'll continue to deteriorate,

01:25:18.069 --> 01:25:24.198
until you return to 1943,
same as your friend, Parker.

01:25:24.412 --> 01:25:27.082
He's lying, David, don't listen
to anything he says.

01:25:27.143 --> 01:25:31.298
- I wish to God I were.
- Leave him alone, just leave him alone.

01:25:32.523 --> 01:25:34.209
He's right, Allison.

01:25:37.362 --> 01:25:39.240
I can feel it.

01:25:41.262 --> 01:25:43.689
What am I to say to you, David, "I'm sorry."?

01:25:44.557 --> 01:25:48.419
I've lived with this thing for 40 years,
there's not a day I didn't feel it.

01:25:48.728 --> 01:25:52.423
What of all this? A new experiment? You did it again!

01:25:52.956 --> 01:25:57.224
Yes... yes.

01:26:07.664 --> 01:26:11.824
The copper coils in the suit should
protect from the electromagnetic forces.

01:26:11.836 --> 01:26:13.691
- What is he doing?
- It's oxygen.

01:26:13.734 --> 01:26:15.409
<i>Is any of this stuff really gonna help me?</i>

01:26:15.445 --> 01:26:21.082
Well, if it doesn't help, it won't matter,
'cause nothing's going to be left here anyway.

01:26:26.287 --> 01:26:29.863
- Can you give me a couple of minutes?
- That's about all you got.

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:41.722
I can't believe it's gonna end like this.

01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:44.953
I can't believe it!

01:26:46.079 --> 01:26:48.016
What's gonna happen?

01:26:49.853 --> 01:26:52.474
I don't know, nobody knows.

01:26:59.718 --> 01:27:02.818
Shoot! Maybe in 40 years I'll...

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:05.075
come back and surprise you again.

01:27:05.076 --> 01:27:09.740
<i>All non-essential personnel are to evacuate
the base before oh-seven-hundred hours.</i>

01:27:15.526 --> 01:27:18.705
<i>David, we gotta go.</i>

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:39.053
I gotta go!

01:27:43.846 --> 01:27:46.438
- How are my sound men?
- We're ready, communications are in.

01:27:46.439 --> 01:27:47.891
<i>Just hope it's all working.</i>

01:27:47.975 --> 01:27:50.571
I'm gonna put "communication ceases"
when you entry the vortex.

01:27:51.083 --> 01:27:54.248
- We won't be able to help ya.
- Am I supposed to drive this?

01:27:54.336 --> 01:27:55.821
- No.
- I am.

01:27:58.383 --> 01:27:59.987
Let's go, son.

01:28:52.667 --> 01:28:56.757
- So, what did you think of 1984?
- Television's great.

01:28:57.589 --> 01:29:03.075
- You didn't see enough of it.
- I didn't see enough of anything.

01:29:05.899 --> 01:29:11.155
<i>Quadrant 5 reading at ten point five degrees, do you read me?
- Yes, I do.</i>

01:29:12.929 --> 01:29:16.820
<i>Vector 3, response is operational,
give us your P.R.D., over.</i>

01:29:17.133 --> 01:29:20.212
<i>P.R.D. eleven point four eight.</i>

01:29:48.036 --> 01:29:53.113
- Are you ready for this?
- I've been there before.

01:29:54.627 --> 01:29:57.742
Here we go! Control?

01:29:58.067 --> 01:30:00.794
<i>We're on the station and almost ready.</i>

01:30:09.684 --> 01:30:14.248
Remember what I told you about position,
be sure you're directly in the center.

01:30:17.858 --> 01:30:21.337
When I blow this thing, it's gonna
pull you straight up into the air.

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:25.321
- Are you ready?
- Let's go!

01:30:26.576 --> 01:30:28.529
All right, good luck, sailor.

01:32:45.046 --> 01:32:50.551
- Davey, <i>what happened?</i>
- We're back on the ship.

01:32:52.142 --> 01:32:56.102
- But the hospital?
- It's all over, you're gonna be all right now.

01:32:56.168 --> 01:33:00.477
<i>- But I gotta go, buddy.</i>
- You're gonna go back?

01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:07.179
- I don't know, I just can't stay here.
- Will I ever see you again?

01:33:09.530 --> 01:33:13.850
One of these days... I promise you that.

01:33:16.959 --> 01:33:20.519
Look, I gotta go now,
take it easy, buddy.

01:33:47.194 --> 01:33:53.643
<i>Emergency medical team report to Hanger Bay 1 on the double!
Report to Hanger Bay 1 for transfer.</i>

01:34:14.706 --> 01:34:19.667
<i>Bravo's along side, there are... there's been fire,
it's still burning at some points...</i>

01:34:19.711 --> 01:34:24.816
<i>There are men moving about on the deck,
they... they appear to be pretty badly burned.</i>

01:34:25.529 --> 01:34:32.483
<i>My God, there's a man... buried...
he's in the steel, he's buried in the deck.</i>

01:34:35.123 --> 01:34:37.324
<i>I can't describe it!</i>

01:34:39.336 --> 01:34:41.513
<i>He's alive! He's al...</i>

01:35:07.447 --> 01:35:10.666
He did it! He... <i>God damn it, he did it!</i>

01:35:17.523 --> 01:35:22.494
<i>He did it! Lord, Almighty, he did it!</i>

01:35:27.605 --> 01:35:29.696
<i>The damn thing worked great!</i>

01:36:50.715 --> 01:36:52.542
David?

01:37:05.903 --> 01:37:08.733
My God, I don't believe it.

01:37:18.979 --> 01:37:21.481
- Ya know what?
- What?

01:37:22.399 --> 01:37:24.395
I got it all figured out...

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:27.642
the Navy owes me 40 years back pay.
