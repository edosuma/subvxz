01:04.188 --> 01:05.725
Lara.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.452
Lara.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.666
Quiet.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.328
What are you doing?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.460
Nothing.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.627
Are you out of your mind?
Stop it.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.788
Too late.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.250
Pretty, don't you think?
- What is wrong with you?

02:57.386 --> 03:00.220
I just wanted my ears pierced,
so I did it.

03:01.640 --> 03:04.348
You disinfected them, I hope?
- I'm not an idiot.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.843
Show me, please. Show me.

03:24.121 --> 03:26.738
Yes. Next, please.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.656
Good luck.

03:36.842 --> 03:40.256
Your classical technique
needs further perfecting.

03:40.387 --> 03:44.381
But it's good enough,
that's not the problem.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.634
Pointe work is new to you.

03:47.769 --> 03:50.136
That might be an issue.

03:50.272 --> 03:55.484
There's a serious risk of damage.
Your feet were trained differently.

03:56.695 --> 04:02.157
Frankly a career as a ballerina
looks doubtful for you.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.868
I'm following the advice
of your previous school.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.160
But we do have great confidence
in your perseverance.

04:10.667 --> 04:16.038
I suggest a trial period
of eight weeks.

04:16.173 --> 04:20.338
Then we'll see
if you're evolving enough...

04:20.469 --> 04:24.088
and if you can keep up
with the other girls.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.384
OK?
- Yes.

04:41.948 --> 04:45.658
All that exercise is to her advantage.

04:45.786 --> 04:52.659
Her bones are strong
despite the puberty inhibitors.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.582
But it's important that she keeps
taking her vitamins.

04:56.713 --> 04:57.829
She does.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.921
And how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.507
There she is.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.843
Let's get you weighed.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.135
Alright?

05:16.858 --> 05:18.190
There.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.185
How are you feeling today?
- Good.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.779
Are you having a good day?
- Yes.

05:23.907 --> 05:26.024
Did you sleep well?

05:26.159 --> 05:29.698
You look good. You're beaming.
- Thank you.

05:30.956 --> 05:34.870
Have you been counting the days
until your hormone treatment?

05:36.127 --> 05:37.334
Yes.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.545
You freely admit that?
- Yes.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.166
Normally people lie first
and I have to worm it out of them.

05:44.928 --> 05:49.548
What did you promise me last time?
- Not to do that too much.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.347
And why did you do it anyway?

05:54.813 --> 05:57.681
I don't do it too much.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.855
But why do it at all?

06:02.821 --> 06:06.815
Because it might make the time
go faster.

06:06.950 --> 06:12.036
No, in fact it goes slower
if you focus on that day.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.531
Live in the present.
Enjoy the moment.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.626
Be a woman now. You are a woman.

06:18.753 --> 06:22.872
That's good, right?
I see a nice, pretty woman.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.507
What do you think the hormone
treatment will change?

06:29.723 --> 06:34.809
My looks. That I'll have breasts
and all that.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.644
Do you look forward
to having breasts?

06:40.191 --> 06:44.561
You're a woman, so you have
a woman's body. Already.

06:45.947 --> 06:52.035
The only thing we can do
is confirm that and support it.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.865
But you already are
everything you will be then.

06:58.793 --> 07:03.037
You understand? Do you believe
I see a woman when I look at you?

07:03.173 --> 07:05.415
Not really.
- No.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.544
That is such a shame.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.769
We can't...
- I'll help you.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.531
Yes, here.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.368
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.291
Mathias.
- Lewis.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.459
Pleased to meet you.

07:47.676 --> 07:52.762
I'm going down to get more boxes.
Would you start unpacking?

07:54.099 --> 07:57.809
Let's put the food in here.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.472
And this?

08:00.689 --> 08:04.558
Here? Or on the other side?
- No, this is practical.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.616
Yes, that one is free.
- Thanks.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.624
Let's do that again.
Move up a bit. And go back.

09:48.755 --> 09:50.417
More épaulement.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.916
Back, back.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.848
Yes.
I missed the épaulement at the end.

10:00.975 --> 10:05.766
And I haven't seen that plié yet.
Let's do bourrée, and straight...

10:25.667 --> 10:32.756
The preparation here is very important.
Plié, then up from the elbow. Again.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.615
Look at each other.

12:48.685 --> 12:53.851
I'm Antoine and this summer I did
an internship in Cannes.

12:53.982 --> 12:57.771
But I actually only went two days
because I was injured.

12:58.569 --> 13:02.529
And you're recovered now?
- Yes, a bit.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.898
OK.

13:04.033 --> 13:08.949
I'm Anke and I'm sixteen
and I'm from Izegem, West-Flanders.

13:09.080 --> 13:13.120
And this summer I made a trip to Rome
in Italy.

13:13.251 --> 13:17.416
OK, and how was Italy?
- Warm. Mostly very warm.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.335
And was it nice?
- Yes, it was.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.335
Your turn.
- I'm Lara and I'm almost 16 as well.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.766
And I've a little brother, he's 6.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.305
OK.

13:33.479 --> 13:40.101
This may be a direct question, but,
Lara, I'll ask you to close your eyes...

13:40.236 --> 13:44.651
while I ask the other girls to raise
their hands...

13:44.782 --> 13:50.278
if they have a problem with Lara changing
in the girl's changing room.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.699
OK, you can close your eyes.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.582
OK, thank you. Your turn.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.381
Hi, my name is Elody and I'm 16.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.505
And I did an internship
at the Paris Opera this summer.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.718
Did you sleep well?

16:12.722 --> 16:15.806
Very well. You?
- Not too bad.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.391
Finish your sandwich and we'll go.

16:18.561 --> 16:22.475
Were you working late last night?
- To 3 or 4 in the morning.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.348
Pretty late.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.154
There's nothing in your pocket.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.820
Yes, there's some dirt in it.
- What?

16:33.951 --> 16:36.785
Dirt.
- Oh.

16:46.589 --> 16:47.955
Thank you.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.754
Would you like a biscuit?
- No, thank you.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.841
27...

16:55.389 --> 16:56.755
And what comes after that?

16:56.891 --> 17:03.309
28, 29, 3... 3...

17:12.990 --> 17:16.028
See you tonight.
- Hi, Milo.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.996
Are you his sister?
- Yes, I am.

17:21.123 --> 17:23.455
Places everybody.
- Yes, miss.

18:00.246 --> 18:06.208
OK, stop. You're like a wooden stick.
That doesn't work.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.499
Your body weight has to play
a part in the action.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.006
Down, and turn. Plié.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.135
Plié, and now.
Up, on your leg, stand.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.930
Up, up.
And long arm.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.687
Turn. Bring your head round.
And forward.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.732
Plié, side.

18:33.154 --> 18:34.986
Plié and...

18:36.324 --> 18:37.860
Turn.

18:40.828 --> 18:46.165
We have a lot of work to do.
A lot of work. A lot.

18:47.084 --> 18:52.375
Girls start doing pointe work
at the age of 12.

18:52.506 --> 18:58.127
Light, gentle exercises that make
their feet stronger and stronger.

18:58.262 --> 19:01.755
You see? So this is really...

19:04.018 --> 19:06.761
forcing it a bit.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.230
Some things can't be changed, right?

19:10.358 --> 19:15.228
You can't just lob bits of your feet off.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.260
From the back, right?
- Yes.

20:18.718 --> 20:24.089
Don't worry, Milo.
You'll make new friends soon.

20:30.146 --> 20:34.231
We empty out the penis and remove
all the cavernous bodies.

20:34.358 --> 20:41.197
Then we close it up and turn it in,
so it becomes your new vagina.

20:41.323 --> 20:47.695
We'll use a part of the glans
to make a clitoris.

20:47.830 --> 20:54.873
Since you're on puberty inhibitors,
your penis may not have grown much.

20:55.004 --> 20:59.795
So we may have to use
some bowel tissue...

20:59.925 --> 21:03.760
to make the vagina deep enough.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.090
What are the potential complications?

21:08.225 --> 21:12.720
The most frequent ones are bleeding...

21:12.855 --> 21:16.769
and slow healing of the wounds.

21:16.901 --> 21:22.738
One very serious complication is
a rectovaginal fistula.

21:22.865 --> 21:27.326
It's a perforation of the bowel
that allows stool to leak into the vagina.

21:27.453 --> 21:31.197
But that's very rare.
- Fortunately it is.

21:31.332 --> 21:35.702
We'll have to give you a colostomy
in any case...

21:35.836 --> 21:38.544
until the wound is completely healed.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.350
You're so tense.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.721
We can stop if you like,
so you can smoke your cigarette.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.312
No, that's OK.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.487
I'm just worried, that's all.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.486
Doesn't it bother you?
- What?

22:08.536 --> 22:10.243
It's good news.

22:10.371 --> 22:13.739
Yes, but seeing those pictures
and stuff. Doesn't that...

22:14.583 --> 22:16.449
Doesn't it bother you?

22:16.877 --> 22:19.620
Not at all. It makes me happy.

22:24.927 --> 22:29.012
It seems to bother you though.
- Well, not really.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.343
OK.

22:35.521 --> 22:37.228
That's alright then.

22:37.356 --> 22:41.191
It's just not something you see
every day. You know?

22:41.318 --> 22:42.854
I know.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.322
How are you doing at school?

22:48.325 --> 22:50.487
Fine. Why?

22:51.871 --> 22:56.411
What are the boys in your class like?
- No idea. Nice guys.

22:56.542 --> 22:59.751
Yes, but is there one who is maybe...

23:02.298 --> 23:04.881
a little nicer than the rest?
- No.

23:05.009 --> 23:08.173
I don't want to talk about that with you.
That's private.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.045
Is that private?

23:10.681 --> 23:13.719
Why are you laughing?
- If it's about me, nothing is private.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.594
Of course not.
- That's weird.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.345
That's just weird.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.515
Also, I never said I fancy boys.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.980
Oh, OK.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.733
That's new.
- Yes.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.612
So you're into girls?
- I don't know.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.486
Maybe.

23:35.664 --> 23:38.532
It's fine. You can tell me.

23:38.667 --> 23:43.128
I would if I knew, but I don't.
What's for dinner?

23:43.839 --> 23:45.796
Shall we invite your special friend?

24:03.317 --> 24:05.980
Stop it. Let's get you dressed.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.320
Come here.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.486
Stop it, or I'll hurt you.
- No. I'm tired.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.282
I know, but it makes no difference.
You'll be late for school.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.870
Stop it.
- No, I won't.

24:22.044 --> 24:24.252
Now sit still.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.670
Stop it.
- Come on.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.666
Stop it, Victor.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.850
Do it yourself then.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.433
Stop.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.785
That's enough.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.284
Don't you hit me.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.503
Are you done?

25:12.761 --> 25:16.095
Why won't you get dressed?

25:39.329 --> 25:42.322
Never use that name
anymore, alright?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.616
OK?
- Yes.

25:55.471 --> 25:57.133
And one...

25:57.264 --> 26:00.757
Arabesque. 90 degrees. Come on.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.727
And one, and two, and three...

26:03.854 --> 26:09.976
and four, and five, and six,
and seven, and eight, and stop. Yes.

26:10.652 --> 26:13.360
One, two...

26:13.530 --> 26:17.490
Tombé, pas de bourrée.
Oh, my dear.

26:17.618 --> 26:21.453
Come on, dance. Move.
Keep it lively.

26:21.580 --> 26:27.793
And one, stand. Move on.
Keep that leg stiff. Stop.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.628
Plié, go, pas de bourrée.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.631
And preparation.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.844
And one, and two.
And move on. Attaque.

26:37.971 --> 26:43.968
One, and attaque, three, and four,
and five, and six. And voilà.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.852
Please drink something.

26:50.734 --> 26:57.322
Five, six, seven eight. Tombé et go.
Five, six, pas de chat. Eight and nine.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.736
Three, four, five, six, good.

26:59.910 --> 27:04.780
And one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, tombé.

27:04.957 --> 27:08.496
And cabriole.
Yes, supple arms.

27:09.044 --> 27:13.755
And tombé. Go.
And five, six, seven, eight.

27:13.924 --> 27:18.885
Good, temps levé, posé and tombé,
pas de bourrée and saut.

27:19.054 --> 27:22.297
Good, Lara.
And one, two, three, four...

27:49.209 --> 27:54.000
Wait. I slap you. You slap me.
And you slap each other.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.678
Ouch. Dammit.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.344
That was too hard.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.260
I can go again.

28:09.897 --> 28:11.433
Can I go again?
- No.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.188
What are you doing?
- A name, animal...

28:22.576 --> 28:28.163
Your teachers are happy with your
efforts. You've made good progress.

28:28.290 --> 28:31.704
Your pointe work is getting better.
But there's still much to do.

28:31.835 --> 28:36.125
You'll have to work hard
to make up arrears.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.832
But you're clearly very talented...

28:39.468 --> 28:42.711
so we'll let you stay on.

28:51.939 --> 28:55.728
They admitted me.
I can stay for the year.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.566
Alright, call me back.

29:15.212 --> 29:16.748
OK?

29:18.340 --> 29:21.378
So, the official moment.

29:21.510 --> 29:25.629
We have the papers for the things
we discussed earlier.

29:25.764 --> 29:29.929
You can stop the hormone treatment...
- Are you listening?

29:30.060 --> 29:32.518
She can't wait to sign.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.813
Stop the hormone treatment
any time you want.

29:35.941 --> 29:38.604
But the effects are irreversible.

29:38.735 --> 29:42.399
We'll imitate female puberty
as closely as possible.

30:05.095 --> 30:10.762
Happy birthday to you.

30:10.892 --> 30:17.264
Happy birthday to you, Lara.

30:17.399 --> 30:23.111
Happy birthday to you.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.158
I bet it's pointe shoes again.

30:33.498 --> 30:36.787
How do you know?
- More pointe shoes.

30:46.219 --> 30:50.338
Thanks for coming, everyone.
Today is an important day for us.

30:51.600 --> 30:56.015
An important moment for our family,
for the three of us.

30:56.146 --> 30:58.138
Stay here, Milo.

30:59.399 --> 31:04.440
It's a new life.
For Lara this is a significant day.

31:06.531 --> 31:10.946
We fought hard to get here.

31:11.703 --> 31:16.823
And it's wonderful
to have you all with us today.

31:17.667 --> 31:20.831
Thank you for that.
- Terrific.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.795
We can tell them, right?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.006
Yes? No?
- Go on then.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.000
It's a boy.

31:28.804 --> 31:33.174
Three boys.
- Three boys.

31:33.433 --> 31:35.220
Three musketeers.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.983
As you know, I'll do a choreography
for you this year.

33:07.110 --> 33:12.902
It'll have group dances, solos,
trios, lots of things.

33:13.033 --> 33:19.496
I hope I can give each of you
a chance to participate.

33:19.623 --> 33:23.617
It'll be an opportunity you have
to create for yourself.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.960
I will have to make choices.

33:26.087 --> 33:29.922
And two, and three...
What's happening there? And five...

33:30.800 --> 33:33.338
Six, and get down in the fourth position.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.382
And move, and move.

33:37.390 --> 33:41.600
And five, and six
and once more, guys.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.532
What are you making?

34:38.659 --> 34:40.777
Ratatouille. Is that OK?

34:41.413 --> 34:45.373
Don't, Lara.
Give me my phone. Give it.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.866
No. Who is this?

34:47.002 --> 34:50.916
I don't know.
I don't read your messages, do I?

34:51.047 --> 34:53.083
Do you?
- No, I don't.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.879
No? Who is it?
- Give me my phone.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.755
I can't see who it is.
Give me my phone so I can see.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.465
Give it to me.

35:04.352 --> 35:07.265
I've seen who it is. Give it back.

35:16.698 --> 35:21.318
It's Christine.
It's... It's Christine.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.072
Yes, thanks.
- She's a new friend of mine.

35:26.750 --> 35:32.121
And no, before you ask.
She's not my girlfriend.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.963
I wasn't going to ask.
- Yeah, right.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.584
Not yet, anyway.

35:40.221 --> 35:44.386
But is it going well?
- I don't know where it's going.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.056
I don't even know
if it's going anywhere, but...

35:49.356 --> 35:51.143
We'll see.

36:10.752 --> 36:15.622
Boy, oh boy. Come on.
Flowing movements.

36:15.757 --> 36:19.250
If you hold back, the motion
is gone and you fall.

36:19.386 --> 36:22.879
Move your whole body, dance deep.

36:23.014 --> 36:27.975
Again. One, in a line. Go on. Move.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.389
Stop.

36:29.521 --> 36:32.810
And torso up. Pas de bourrée.

36:34.442 --> 36:36.229
And walk.

36:39.656 --> 36:41.522
And stand.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.777
Plié. And...

36:47.455 --> 36:49.242
Oh, dear.

36:49.624 --> 36:54.961
Work harder, or it will be
a hopeless situation.

36:55.088 --> 36:59.879
If you really want this, work for it.
That's how it goes.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.343
You're not giving up, are you?
Come on. Let's go.

37:40.925 --> 37:45.295
Have you ever fancied anyone?
- No.

37:45.430 --> 37:49.265
Never?
Not even in kindergarten?

37:52.020 --> 37:55.104
I can't remember, but I don't think so.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.563
What if you met someone?

38:07.619 --> 38:12.239
I don't know. It's never happened.
- But suppose it does.

38:12.749 --> 38:16.584
Suppose when you leave here today...

38:18.379 --> 38:21.087
someone greets you.

38:22.884 --> 38:26.844
And he has a motorbike. Do you like
guys with motorbikes? No.

38:26.971 --> 38:30.305
He has a bicycle.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.975
You have a flat tyre.

38:37.065 --> 38:41.605
And he offers to take you home
on his bicycle.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.318
Does that sound nice?
- Yes.

38:43.446 --> 38:44.937
Would you do it?

38:46.658 --> 38:47.899
I don't know.

38:48.910 --> 38:52.995
Why not?
- Because I think I...

38:54.290 --> 38:58.159
I don't want to do that yet
with this body.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.171
You'd rather wait until after the operation?

39:02.674 --> 39:03.710
Yes.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.959
It's a shame though

39:06.094 --> 39:09.132
to put all those emotions on hold.

39:09.931 --> 39:14.175
Maybe you should let yourself
enjoy these two years.

39:14.310 --> 39:19.146
Because that enjoyment will help you
after the operation.

39:19.274 --> 39:22.062
Then you don't waste time.

39:22.193 --> 39:27.564
You won't sit around waiting
in a cold bus shelter...

39:27.699 --> 39:30.066
until that bus finally shows up.

39:32.829 --> 39:36.163
What kind of boys do you like?
- Sorry?

39:36.291 --> 39:39.875
What type of boys do you fancy?

41:11.970 --> 41:14.428
What's the matter?

41:14.555 --> 41:16.262
Go back to sleep.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.814
You're crying?

41:31.823 --> 41:34.315
What's the matter?

41:39.122 --> 41:40.909
I don't know.

41:41.916 --> 41:44.750
You don't know why you're crying?

41:49.340 --> 41:52.583
You don't know? Or you won't say?

41:52.719 --> 41:54.802
No, I don't know.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.092
My hormones.

41:59.892 --> 42:01.724
Your hormones.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.554
You're just saying something.

42:06.816 --> 42:09.980
I don't know.
I'm scared that it won't work.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.398
That it won't change a thing.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.827
I see a lot of change already.

42:33.468 --> 42:37.212
I think you don't realise
how brave you are.

42:38.723 --> 42:41.887
You're an example to lots of
other people, you know?

42:43.311 --> 42:45.849
I don't want to be an example.

42:49.317 --> 42:51.650
I just want to be a girl.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.688
But you are a girl.

42:58.326 --> 42:59.942
I see a girl.

43:04.373 --> 43:07.207
It's just that you want to be
a woman right away.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.040
But that's not how it works.

43:14.175 --> 43:17.668
Do you think I was a man
the minute I was born?

43:22.391 --> 43:25.225
There's no need to hurry.

43:25.978 --> 43:28.561
Enjoy puberty while it lasts.

43:30.316 --> 43:32.808
It'll be over before you know it.

43:45.331 --> 43:48.324
Are you going to cry all night?
- No.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.451
Don't drench my sheets now.

43:51.420 --> 43:53.332
Bitch.

43:53.464 --> 43:55.376
Bitch yourself.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.850
Lara...
- No, go away. Go away.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.686
Does anyone know Fiona's part?

44:59.822 --> 45:01.939
Lara. Show us.

45:06.913 --> 45:10.657
Continue, guys. We need to see for Lara.

45:11.167 --> 45:14.126
Pointe, piqué, arabesqeu.
Don't stop.

45:18.341 --> 45:19.752
Coup de pied.

45:21.719 --> 45:24.883
And back. Go on.

45:30.603 --> 45:32.265
Coup de pied.

45:39.153 --> 45:40.894
And once more, one...

45:41.030 --> 45:43.943
Keep it up.
Balance.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.609
Left.

46:20.820 --> 46:24.109
Aren't you taking a shower?
- Well, no.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.024
You're not showering?
- I don't sweat.

46:27.159 --> 46:29.526
You don't sweat? Are you joking?

46:30.413 --> 46:34.327
Everyone is sweating buckets except you.

46:34.458 --> 46:36.370
Nothing.
- No, not much.

46:38.004 --> 46:41.714
People are asking questions
and talking about you.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.339
Why don't you shower?
We don't care.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.838
I don't know. I didn't bring anything.

46:49.974 --> 46:52.762
What do you mean?
- I didn't bring any shower stuff.

46:52.893 --> 46:55.886
You don't need anything to shower.
- I don't have a towel.

46:56.022 --> 46:58.355
I've got one for you.

46:58.482 --> 46:59.973
Here.

47:41.901 --> 47:42.901
Go on, Milo.

47:58.709 --> 48:01.918
Why did you do that
this morning?

48:09.470 --> 48:10.551
Lara?

48:15.434 --> 48:17.517
We made rules, remember.

48:18.729 --> 48:22.348
I'm not angry.
I'm just trying to understand it.

48:23.567 --> 48:27.311
We talked about that.
We bought underwear.

48:27.446 --> 48:29.483
Special underwear.

48:31.492 --> 48:33.779
You don't need to do it like that.

48:36.831 --> 48:38.367
Well I suppose it doesn't work.

48:38.499 --> 48:42.118
Then tell me. It's fine.
We'll think of something.

48:43.170 --> 48:46.834
But don't do it like that.
It's bad for your body.

48:48.551 --> 48:53.091
I know it's hard, but let's find a solution.
I don't want you doing that.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.927
Aren't you going to answer?
- OK.

49:02.064 --> 49:05.683
Should we figure something out?
- No, it's alright.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.530
Promise you won't do that anymore.

49:17.079 --> 49:18.240
Yes.

50:07.213 --> 50:10.706
Come on, Lara. We'll be late.
- Coming.

51:03.561 --> 51:04.722
Oh, what happened?

51:31.297 --> 51:35.667
Keep the legs together.
And the fifth.

51:41.015 --> 51:43.302
Close the fifth. Close.

52:28.604 --> 52:33.440
I think this is yours.
It was in our mailbox.

52:33.567 --> 52:35.103
Thank you.

52:43.911 --> 52:48.201
Do you want a drink?
- Yes, please.

52:48.332 --> 52:52.167
Of course.
- Thank you.

52:58.384 --> 53:00.922
Ignore the mess, that's my brother.

53:01.053 --> 53:03.921
What would you like?
- Anything.

53:04.973 --> 53:08.557
We have coke, beer, water, wine.

53:10.396 --> 53:12.809
Water's fine.

53:18.278 --> 53:22.397
Your apartment is just like ours.
That's funny.

53:27.996 --> 53:29.737
Here you are.
- Thank you.

54:35.814 --> 54:38.773
I'm going to ask
for an increased dose.

54:39.443 --> 54:41.480
Of my hormones.

54:49.244 --> 54:52.078
That's not a good idea.
- Why not?

54:53.540 --> 54:57.534
It's not your decision to make.
- That's why I'm asking.

54:59.963 --> 55:04.458
I think they'll say no.
- I'll ask anyway.

55:05.302 --> 55:08.170
And I don't want it increased.

55:17.773 --> 55:21.608
600 grams down.
Is everything alright at school?

55:21.735 --> 55:24.273
Yes.
- Not too intensive?

55:24.404 --> 55:28.990
Your body will change. I promise.

55:29.117 --> 55:33.202
Do you know when?
It's taking so long.

55:35.999 --> 55:39.959
The first six months
I can't increase the dosage.

55:40.087 --> 55:42.329
It's not healthy.

55:42.464 --> 55:47.550
I wish I could tell you something
other than be patient. But it takes time.

55:47.678 --> 55:52.639
Try not to fixate on your looks.

56:09.575 --> 56:11.737
Go, lift up...

56:12.202 --> 56:13.488
Plié. The other arm.

56:14.329 --> 56:18.323
You keep on pushing back
instead of leaning on your legs.

56:18.458 --> 56:20.165
We start again.

56:20.294 --> 56:22.251
Again, again, again.

57:02.336 --> 57:07.377
Come on. I know you're in pain.
I'm not going to give in.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.464
Come on. Préparation, and...

57:10.260 --> 57:12.752
Straight. And, go.

57:14.181 --> 57:17.049
Yes. And finish correctly.
Why can't you do it?

57:17.184 --> 57:22.896
I told you, when you turn and lose balance,
push this shoulder forward.

57:23.023 --> 57:25.140
Then you'll stop.

57:26.693 --> 57:29.686
Come. That's enough for today.

57:38.997 --> 57:43.958
You make this so hard on yourself.
So hard.

57:49.633 --> 57:52.296
Alright, have fun.
- Thanks.

57:57.599 --> 57:59.465
Love you.

58:01.770 --> 58:04.308
This is your room.
- OK.

58:04.439 --> 58:06.396
The girls sleep in the other room.

58:06.525 --> 58:10.144
They are already in the pool.
I'll be in the kitchen.

59:42.245 --> 59:44.077
Clothes, clothes.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.666
What do you like?
- Is it for the summer?

59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.761
Try this.

01:00:00.889 --> 01:00:03.381
Can I put this on?
- Smile.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.514
Gang bang, guys.
- Yes.

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:08.762
Gang bang.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:17.027
Lara is wearing a sexy bra.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.407
That's pretty.
- It suits you.

01:00:21.535 --> 01:00:23.401
Do you use bra-fillers?
- No.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.037
Oh my god, my sunglasses.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:33.457
I love that dress.
- Take the pants off though.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:37.172
That's not nice.
- 'That's not nice.'

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.962
But I'm right.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.426
You really have nice clothes.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.846
And Lara too.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:52.521
How do you do it in ballet class?
Do you tuck it away?

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:55.399
Your...

01:00:56.778 --> 01:00:58.394
Your third leg.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:02.575
What?

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:05.655
Under your dress.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.028
Show us.
- No.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:08.662
Just for me please.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.369
And because Elodie never saw a dick before.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.242
That's true.
- Really?

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.165
I have no brothers, so...

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:18.664
Go on, it's my birthday.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:24.174
No, please.
- You've seen all of us naked.

01:01:24.306 --> 01:01:26.798
Now we want to see you naked.
- That's not the same.

01:01:26.933 --> 01:01:31.724
It's not hard. You've seen us naked,
so we can see you naked.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:34.856
I don't want to.
- Show us.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:39.189
But what's the problem?
It's no big deal, right?

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:43.031
Just us girls together.
Do you want to be a boy or a girl?

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:46.446
Stop it.
- Should we see you as boy or girl?

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.194
That's all.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.164
Should we see you as a girl or a boy?

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:57.291
It's just a question. Should we
see you as a girl or a boy?

01:01:57.422 --> 01:01:59.880
Stop it.
- I'm asking a simple question.

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:04.469
You don't want to say?
Boy or girl, you're not saying?

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:07.805
You don't look like a girl now?
So you look like a boy.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.641
So you want to be a girl or a boy?
- Girl.

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:15.389
Finally. OK, so let's see your thing.
- Leave him.

01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:19.062
What's so hard about that?
You're in our dressing room.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:23.404
You see us naked. You saw
everyone's pussy. We don't care.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:26.945
So show us your dick.
It's no big deal.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.739
You want me to do it?
- Stop.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:32.284
I'll do it. You want me to?

01:02:54.229 --> 01:02:56.346
Thank you.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:58.055
That wasn't so hard, was it?
- No.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:01.355
OK, great. We're all agreed.
Now don't be angry.

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:02.977
Are you angry?
- No.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.271
Alright? Everything's fine.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.973
What are you doing here?

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.597
I came home. My stomach hurts.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:24.066
How did you get back?
- On the subway.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:30.151
Christine, Lara.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.775
Lara, Christine.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.533
I'll be in my room.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.584
I'll be right back.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:47.624
You just go back to...

01:04:47.759 --> 01:04:50.046
Christine.
- She's all alone.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:58.221
What's going on?
- Nothing. My stomach hurts.

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:02.521
Is that why you left?
- Yes.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:09.311
But I'm fine now.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:13.031
Why didn't you call? I'd have come.
- I forgot.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:23.246
Did you...

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:31.259
Did you smoke a joint, did you drink?
Is that it? You don't want to say?

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:34.629
No, I don't smoke dope, I didn't drink.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.640
OK.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:48.480
If you don't want to be alone, join us.
- No, I'll leave you two together.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:53.489
Well, suit yourself.
- OK.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:11.962
I've had enough of this nonsense.
Tell me what happened.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:16.588
I told you yesterday.
- What, that stomach story?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.090
Yes.
- I don't buy that.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.137
Tough luck.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:25.555
'Tough luck.'

01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:41.244
I don't want you to worry.
- Right.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:49.996
That's fine.

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:02.971
You lost a lot of weight
and you have a genital infection.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:05.719
You have to stop taping.

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:09.974
It's important to be physically
strong enough for the operation.

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:17.573
Right now your body is unable to cope
with a serious operation like that.

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.110
Do you have a lot of stress?
- No.

01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:24.580
Lara, please. That's not true.
- It is.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.243
It's not.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:35.716
I'm sorry, but I see that Lara is
not eating and she sleeps badly.

01:07:35.843 --> 01:07:39.757
No, I...
- I know this is tough for you.

01:07:39.889 --> 01:07:44.350
I'm happy to increase the hormones,
but first I must be confident...

01:07:44.477 --> 01:07:49.063
that you're strong enough
and feeling well.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:53.730
The only way we can help you is
if we know what's going on.

01:07:56.698 --> 01:08:00.533
What do you think and feel? Talk to us.
- I'm fine.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.151
No, you need to be better.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:10.894
Three couples, quickly,
fifth position.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:16.451
No.
- Lara. Oh, sorry.

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.915
Get out.
- I'm not looking. Listen.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:20.875
I don't care.
- I'm not looking.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:23.120
Come back later.
- Don't use that tone with me.

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:26.169
You're in my room.
- Don't use that tone.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.919
I have to go. I made dinner for you two.

01:12:30.054 --> 01:12:34.173
Please feed him and yourself too.
- Yes, I'll eat. Can you go now?

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.516
Yes, off you go.
- Oh lala, drama queen.

01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:38.135
No, but...

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:39.769
Dammit.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:18.475
I lost my keys.
- You can come in.

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.094
Thank you.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:30.200
Wait, wait.

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:34.769
What's wrong?
Is everything alright?

01:17:35.651 --> 01:17:38.394
Why do you always ask me that?

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:42.947
Do you want me to ask you that
all the time?

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:48.120
Yes, actually, that would be nice.

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.206
Is everything alright?

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:55.286
How are things at work?
And with Christine? Are you sure?

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:58.539
You're not too angry? Not too nice?
Are you in a good mood?

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.963
What did you have for breakfast?
Annoying, isn't it?

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:11.761
Does it bother you that I worry?
- Sometimes a bit, yes.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:27.067
I ask how you are
because you never tell me anything.

01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:30.412
I have my reasons.
- For never telling me anything?

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.323
Maybe because I'm not alright.

01:18:34.251 --> 01:18:36.789
You know what you always say?
'I'm fine.'

01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:40.756
That's why I ask.
Because I know you're not fine.

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:44.752
And you always say the opposite.
'I'm fine, I'm fine.'

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:48.346
So what do I do? I'm your father.
I worry. I ask how you are.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:53.218
And I'd like to hear you say
things are not fine.

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:55.516
So we can talk about it.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.065
OK.

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:07.736
What's going on?

01:19:12.081 --> 01:19:13.117
Well...

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:18.410
It's too hard.
- What is?

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:22.755
See? You stop talking.
I'm your dad.

01:19:26.303 --> 01:19:28.761
Tell me what's not going well.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.858
Do you want to stop?
Find a new school?

01:19:51.745 --> 01:19:56.581
Do you have doubts about this?
- No, it's not that.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:59.543
I don't know if it was a good idea
because...

01:19:59.670 --> 01:20:02.663
We all moved here, and then...

01:20:04.925 --> 01:20:09.511
Milo's new school, your job,
a new apartment...

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:12.301
But it makes no difference.

01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:16.593
How would you like things to be?

01:20:18.147 --> 01:20:19.934
I don't know.

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:24.101
Just that it would work out.
- You mean it doesn't?

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:28.947
I didn't change jobs.
I drove a taxi, I still do.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:32.401
Your brother is six.

01:20:34.038 --> 01:20:39.409
So he changes school.
It's not like he left old friends behind.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:45.377
And don't tell me you loved
your old school so much.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:48.170
So that has improved, hasn't it?

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:52.717
Try to see the positive things.
That's positive.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:57.764
You're in one of the best dance
academies in the country. You know?

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.512
You have doctors treating you.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:03.598
It's all good.

01:21:05.152 --> 01:21:07.144
It's all good.

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:53.441
This was a good run. Did you feel it?
It was super.

01:21:53.575 --> 01:21:58.036
You were all in step, and very focused.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:02.282
The difference with yesterday
is unbelievable.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:05.627
This was the last studio run.
Tomorrow we go on stage.

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:47.913
Look.

01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.785
Why didn't you wake me?

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:54.871
Because you needed rest.

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:57.836
Milo, hurry. We have to go.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:00.836
Lara, come here. We're eating.

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:05.341
You haven't eaten anything, Lara.
- Yes, he's right.

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:10.348
Lara.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:20.272
Where are my keys?

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:23.779
Sit down, let's talk.
- Where are my keys?

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:40.753
Lara.

01:25:41.762 --> 01:25:45.472
Where are my keys?
- No idea. I don't have them.

01:25:45.599 --> 01:25:47.465
Back off.
- Let me go.

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:49.012
Stop.

01:25:51.396 --> 01:25:53.058
Stop it.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:56.565
Let me go.
- Stop.

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:58.559
Lara, stop it.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:02.109
Stop.

01:26:03.367 --> 01:26:05.359
Stop.

01:26:06.328 --> 01:26:08.285
Calm down.

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:11.322
Calm down, please.

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:17.499
Stop.

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:38.558
First you should regain your strength.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:45.232
So no dancing for a while, OK?
Then we'll think again.

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:49.987
We want to make clear
that Lara is not fit enough...

01:26:50.122 --> 01:26:53.991
to go through with this process.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:27:00.623
Not that we'll stop the hormone
treatment, but like I said earlier:

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:03.795
If she keeps undermining her body
like this...

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.057
Hello.
- Hi.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:41.727
Kiss?
- Sure.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.562
Hi.
- Hello.

01:28:44.694 --> 01:28:46.276
Happy New Year.

01:28:48.114 --> 01:28:50.276
Hey, Milo. How are you?

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:53.950
No, Mathias.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:58.703
Oh, that's lovely. Beautiful.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.202
How are you?

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:04.579
Hello.

01:29:05.715 --> 01:29:09.880
You're beautiful.
You look terrific in that dress.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:12.173
You're pretty.
- Thank you.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:15.723
You look pretty.

01:29:16.268 --> 01:29:20.057
You look beautiful.
- You're so gorgeous.

01:29:20.230 --> 01:29:23.018
That's a great dress.
- Thank you.

01:29:23.733 --> 01:29:25.224
Two.
- Two.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.649
Hello, how are you?
- Fine, and you?

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:30.146
I'm fine.
- And the baby?

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:32.865
It's huge.
- That must be tiring.

01:29:51.845 --> 01:29:53.711
There we are.
- Wow.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:55.846
Oh lala.

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:02.303
Fantastic.

01:30:02.439 --> 01:30:04.977
Did you make this, Lara?
- Yes.

01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:08.647
Well done.
- Thanks, Lara.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:20.371
Shall I serve, Lara?
You want me to serve?

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.616
Enough?
- We're fine here.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.874
The children's corner.

01:30:27.380 --> 01:30:30.373
I picked up the wrong glass.

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:38.803
Five, four, three, two, one.
Happy New Year.

01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:30.183
Lara.

01:31:32.529 --> 01:31:34.691
Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.108
Coffee?
- Thank you.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:53.923
Are you hungry?

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:57.922
There's plenty left.

01:32:07.022 --> 01:32:09.184
Is it strong enough?

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:13.233
Yes. Thanks.

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:36.082
I'll let you sleep in a bit.
- Thank you.

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.104
I'm just dropping your brother off.
Be right back.

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.276
Kiss.
- Wow.

01:33:05.997 --> 01:33:07.954
See you in a bit.
- Bye.

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:09.745
