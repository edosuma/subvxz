01:25.943 --> 01:27.710
good morning,
space explorers.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.079
Congratulations,
sammy and nick.

01:30.081 --> 01:31.414
You've both scored high marks

01:31.416 --> 01:33.048
on your space explorers exam.

01:33.050 --> 01:35.751
I'm so excited,
captain maya.

01:35.753 --> 01:38.054
We're all so excited
to have you both on board

01:38.056 --> 01:42.125
- as the newest members of the space explorer team.
- Who o-hoo!

01:42.127 --> 01:44.593
You two have been
assigned to a planet

01:44.595 --> 01:45.828
in the milky way galaxy.

01:45.830 --> 01:48.732
Yum!
That makes me hungry.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.799
The milky way galaxy?

01:50.801 --> 01:53.069
That's right. There's
an incredible planet there

01:53.071 --> 01:54.971
that you'll be exploring
called earth.

01:54.973 --> 01:57.107
Earth. I've heard
stories of that planet.

01:57.109 --> 02:01.010
I've heard there's jungles,
deserts, oceans,

02:01.012 --> 02:04.147
and woods
all on one planet.

02:04.149 --> 02:05.682
And there's
much more than that.

02:05.684 --> 02:07.951
You two will be documenting
planet earth

02:07.953 --> 02:09.785
and relaying information
you find

02:09.787 --> 02:11.855
back to us here
at headquarters.

02:11.857 --> 02:13.790
- Super terrific.
- For starters,

02:13.792 --> 02:16.493
there's one important question
we have for you to answer

02:16.495 --> 02:17.559
on your trip today.

02:17.561 --> 02:18.560
What's that?

02:18.562 --> 02:19.995
Why is it that the earth

02:19.997 --> 02:22.464
is so difficult to see
from outer space?

02:22.466 --> 02:25.501
That's a good question,
captain maya.

02:25.503 --> 02:27.436
I sure hope
we can find an answer.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.804
Well, off you go.

02:28.806 --> 02:30.473
Your space pod will help you
on your journey.

02:30.475 --> 02:32.477
Space explorers, go!

02:40.651 --> 02:45.588
Wow! Look at all
those planets!

02:45.590 --> 02:47.055
It's incredible!

02:47.057 --> 02:48.658
Destination reached,

02:48.660 --> 02:50.493
the milky way galaxy.

02:50.495 --> 02:53.762
- What's that planet over there?
- That looks like jupiter.

02:53.764 --> 02:56.131
That's correct, nick.
That is jupiter.

02:56.133 --> 02:58.667
It's a planet made up
primarily of gases.

03:00.005 --> 03:01.737
Did you say "gases"?

03:01.739 --> 03:05.541
Oh, nick.
You're being silly.

03:05.543 --> 03:10.146
It's the reason why it's often
referred to as the gas giant.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.015
It's over 2 1/2 times larger

03:12.017 --> 03:14.083
than all other planets
in this solar system combined.

03:14.085 --> 03:16.518
That's huge.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.122
It's huge, but there
are not any life forms on jupiter.

03:19.124 --> 03:21.560
Approaching planet earth.

03:31.168 --> 03:33.769
- There it is.
- Earth!

03:33.771 --> 03:35.171
I've heard stories
of this planet.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.874
There's hundreds of species
that live there.

03:37.876 --> 03:40.642
Actually, nick,
over 8.7 million species

03:40.644 --> 03:41.710
live on earth.

03:41.712 --> 03:44.947
8.7 million species!

03:44.949 --> 03:47.049
That's a lot of different
forms of life.

03:47.051 --> 03:49.518
Indeed,
it is a lot of species.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.620
That's why you two will be
spending a lot of time on earth,

03:51.622 --> 03:54.057
documenting and relaying
back information

03:54.059 --> 03:56.525
to us here at
space explorers headquarters.

03:56.527 --> 03:59.195
This is going to be
an amazing adventure.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.898
Why don't you two go explore
the earth's surface?

04:01.900 --> 04:04.703
Space explorers, go!

04:14.279 --> 04:16.911
Over 70 %
of the earth's surface

04:16.914 --> 04:19.047
is covered by water
called oceans.

04:19.048 --> 04:23.585
- The ocean looks beautiful!
- It certainly is.

04:23.587 --> 04:26.889
And it's home to almost 94 %
of all earth's species.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.057
Look over there.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.259
Those look like dolphins.

04:30.261 --> 04:32.761
Wow, what an amazing fish.

04:32.763 --> 04:34.931
Bottle nose dolphins,
to be exact.

04:34.933 --> 04:37.266
And sorry, nick,
but the dolphin isn't a fish.

04:37.268 --> 04:39.268
- It's a mammal.
- That's right.

04:39.270 --> 04:42.939
Mammals can live
in the ocean and on land.

04:42.941 --> 04:44.773
Why don't you have
the space pod scan them

04:44.775 --> 04:45.975
to give you more information?

04:45.977 --> 04:48.110
Space pod,
scan those dolphins.

04:48.112 --> 04:49.112
Scanning.

04:49.114 --> 04:51.213
I think the dolphin sees us.

04:51.215 --> 04:53.715
What can you tell us
about the dolphin, space pod?

04:53.717 --> 04:55.617
The bottle nose dolphin

04:55.619 --> 04:58.687
can weigh over 1,000 pounds.

04:58.689 --> 05:03.292
Their curved dorsal fin
in the middle of their back,

05:03.294 --> 05:06.194
along with
their powerful tails,

05:06.196 --> 05:07.896
allow them to swim

05:07.898 --> 05:11.768
at speeds well over
20 miles per hour.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.670
That's fast!

05:13.672 --> 05:15.605
Not as fast as our space pod.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.109
Let's go explore some more.

05:24.648 --> 05:26.081
Look down there!

05:26.083 --> 05:28.217
It's so green.

05:28.219 --> 05:30.218
Amazing.

05:30.220 --> 05:32.287
That's the jungle,
space explorers.

05:32.289 --> 05:34.990
There's all sorts of amazing
critters living in there.

05:34.992 --> 05:36.191
What's that, space pod?

05:36.193 --> 05:38.261
That is a spider monkey.

05:38.263 --> 05:41.663
They use their tail
like a fifth limb,

05:41.665 --> 05:43.633
and it helps them
jump and move

05:43.635 --> 05:47.069
through the dense jungle trees
and plants.

05:47.071 --> 05:48.670
They're so fast.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.941
And so cuddly.

05:51.943 --> 05:53.876
I just wanna hug one.

05:53.878 --> 05:55.313
Where should we go next,
sammy?

06:04.922 --> 06:06.922
Look at that surface.

06:06.924 --> 06:08.691
I don't see many animals
down there.

06:08.693 --> 06:10.660
Those are desert sand dunes.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.362
There aren't that many species
that live here,

06:12.364 --> 06:13.929
but the ones that do

06:13.931 --> 06:16.098
have adapted to survive
in this harsh climate.

06:16.100 --> 06:19.001
I'd love to slide down those
mountains of sand.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.802
That would be fun.

06:20.804 --> 06:23.105
Wow, look at those guys.

06:23.107 --> 06:25.908
Whoa, such an
incredible creature.

06:25.910 --> 06:27.944
And look at those humps!

06:27.946 --> 06:29.946
What can you tell us
about them, space pod?

06:29.948 --> 06:32.749
The camel can
reach seven feet high

06:32.751 --> 06:37.352
and run over 40 miles
per hour at top speed.

06:37.354 --> 06:40.189
Whoa, that's even faster
than the dolphin.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.225
Camels have three eyelids

06:42.227 --> 06:44.694
and two rows of eyelashes

06:44.696 --> 06:47.929
that prevent sand from getting
in their eyes.

06:47.931 --> 06:50.932
Good idea. It is pretty
windy around here.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.370
Let's go get some air.

07:01.979 --> 07:06.415
What in the world are those
big white puffy things?

07:06.417 --> 07:09.052
Space pod,
can you do a scan of the area?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.386
Scanning.
The white puffy substance

07:11.388 --> 07:14.389
you are seeing
are called clouds.

07:14.391 --> 07:19.929
They are actually a large group
of tiny, tiny water droplets.

07:19.931 --> 07:21.797
Look, sammy,
from above the clouds,

07:21.799 --> 07:24.100
you can't even see all
the amazing colors of earth.

07:24.102 --> 07:25.934
It's completely blocked.

07:25.936 --> 07:27.203
I think we have the answer

07:27.205 --> 07:29.706
to captain maya's
secret question.

07:29.708 --> 07:31.740
Space explorers, go!

07:31.742 --> 07:33.141
Fantastic work, gang.

07:33.143 --> 07:35.177
Your first mission
was a great success.

07:35.179 --> 07:36.746
Yippee!

07:36.748 --> 07:38.280
And did you
find out the answer

07:38.282 --> 07:40.482
to our secret question?
Yes, we did.

07:40.484 --> 07:41.951
The reason why the earth

07:41.953 --> 07:44.220
is so difficult to see
from outer space

07:44.222 --> 07:46.489
is because of clouds
of water vapor.

07:46.491 --> 07:48.790
The layers of clouds
make the earth look like

07:48.792 --> 07:51.093
a white shining orb
from outer space.

07:51.095 --> 07:53.129
And difficult
to see the surface,

07:53.131 --> 07:57.066
which is all sorts
of incredible colors!

07:57.068 --> 07:59.235
That's fascinating, team.
Good work.

07:59.237 --> 08:01.136
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

08:01.138 --> 08:03.806
This next mission is sure
to be your toughest yet,

08:03.808 --> 08:04.874
space explorers.

08:04.876 --> 08:07.343
Cool space gases!

08:07.345 --> 08:09.444
I love difficult missions.

08:09.446 --> 08:11.179
I'm always up
for a challenge, too.

08:11.181 --> 08:12.881
Well, i'm excited to report

08:12.883 --> 08:14.751
you two will be heading
back to earth.

08:14.753 --> 08:16.819
Yay! Earth!

08:16.821 --> 08:18.121
We love earth.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.857
We want you to learn
all about snakes.

08:20.859 --> 08:24.025
Snakes? So exciting.

08:24.027 --> 08:27.463
This is going to be
our most amazing mission yet.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.266
What can you tell us about
snakes, captain maya?

08:30.268 --> 08:33.169
I can tell you that snakes
live everywhere on earth

08:33.171 --> 08:35.471
except ire land, ice land,
new zeal and,

08:35.472 --> 08:37.205
and the north and south poles.

08:37.207 --> 08:38.506
Snakes possibly evolved

08:38.509 --> 08:40.909
from a four-legged
reptilian ancestor,

08:40.912 --> 08:42.344
a small four-legged lizard,

08:42.346 --> 08:44.514
about 100 million years ago.

08:44.516 --> 08:46.982
Some snakes,
like boas and pythons,

08:46.984 --> 08:48.785
still have traces
of back legs,

08:48.787 --> 08:50.118
called leg spurs.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.188
Wow. I can't wait
to check them out.

08:52.190 --> 08:56.092
Snakes sound
absolutely fascinating.

08:56.094 --> 08:59.862
They are. Snakes are an integral
part of earth's ecosystem.

08:59.864 --> 09:01.497
They are so important,
in fact,

09:01.499 --> 09:03.466
that the symbol
of the snake in art

09:03.468 --> 09:05.501
is one of the most
widespread and oldest

09:05.503 --> 09:07.203
in the history of the world.

09:07.205 --> 09:09.539
The oldest written record
about snakes

09:09.541 --> 09:12.875
dates to 450 b.c.
in ancient egypt.

09:12.877 --> 09:15.911
Really? That's incredible,
captain maya.

09:15.913 --> 09:18.046
As you know, nick and sammy,

09:18.048 --> 09:20.082
every time we send
our space explorers

09:20.084 --> 09:22.150
to observe
a new earth species,

09:22.152 --> 09:24.820
we ask them to collect
as much data as possible.

09:24.822 --> 09:27.522
- Yes, ma'am.
- We will!

09:27.524 --> 09:29.424
But above all,
there's a question

09:29.426 --> 09:31.526
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

09:31.528 --> 09:33.963
have not been able
to answer about snakes.

09:33.965 --> 09:35.897
We need you two
space explorers

09:35.899 --> 09:39.267
to help us answer the mission
question about snakes.

09:39.269 --> 09:40.969
What's the question?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.405
Do all snakes
have hinged fangs?

09:43.407 --> 09:47.343
That's a very interesting
question, captain maya.

09:47.345 --> 09:50.045
We'll find the answer,
i promise.

09:50.047 --> 09:52.415
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

09:52.417 --> 09:54.851
will transport you a million
light years to earth

09:54.853 --> 09:56.151
in a blink of an eye.

09:56.153 --> 09:58.521
And your trusty helper
robot cup-k

09:58.523 --> 10:00.021
will assist you
on your mission.

10:00.023 --> 10:02.222
Off you go.

10:02.224 --> 10:03.358
Space explorers, go!

10:03.360 --> 10:07.264
Space explorers, go!

10:17.575 --> 10:21.109
We are about to reach our
destination, space explorers...

10:21.111 --> 10:23.445
- earth!
- Wow.

10:23.447 --> 10:25.146
Look at that!

10:25.148 --> 10:28.317
The most beautiful place
in all the universe.

10:28.319 --> 10:29.888
I love earth.

10:35.893 --> 10:38.093
First stop, south america.

10:38.095 --> 10:42.298
That's where we will find many
fascinating species of snakes.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.666
South america?

10:44.668 --> 10:47.270
I always wanted
to visit south america.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.670
Hello, space explorers.

10:48.672 --> 10:50.906
I see you'll be heading
to south america.

10:50.908 --> 10:52.073
How exciting.

10:52.075 --> 10:53.476
Cup-k, please,

10:53.478 --> 10:55.343
fill the space explorers in

10:55.345 --> 10:56.947
on some amazing facts
about south america.

11:01.985 --> 11:03.586
Sure, captain maya.

11:03.588 --> 11:06.421
Nick, sammy,

11:06.423 --> 11:08.991
did you know
that a desert in chile

11:08.993 --> 11:10.492
called the atacama

11:10.494 --> 11:13.929
is the driest place
in the world?

11:13.931 --> 11:15.997
Some parts of the atacama

11:15.999 --> 11:20.035
haven't received
any rain in years.

11:20.037 --> 11:24.540
Still, over a million people
live there.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.342
That's incredible.

11:26.344 --> 11:28.711
The longest mountain
range in the world

11:28.713 --> 11:30.512
is in south america, too.

11:30.514 --> 11:33.015
It's called
the and es mountains.

11:33.017 --> 11:34.617
I never knew that.

11:34.619 --> 11:38.654
Another interesting fact
about south america

11:38.656 --> 11:42.123
is that around 40 % of earth's
plant and animal species

11:42.125 --> 11:43.659
are found there.

11:43.661 --> 11:48.030
Consider, south america
covers only 12 %

11:48.032 --> 11:51.000
of the earth's
total land surface.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.501
Amazing!

11:52.503 --> 11:55.371
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

11:55.373 --> 11:58.006
We're approaching
earth exosphere.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.543
Who o... hoo!

12:00.545 --> 12:02.213
Who o-hoo!

12:05.383 --> 12:08.049
We have entered
earth's stratosphere.

12:08.051 --> 12:10.051
Approaching south america,

12:10.053 --> 12:12.154
the amazon rain forest,
to be precise.

12:12.156 --> 12:14.390
Awesome.

12:14.392 --> 12:16.758
Cool space gases!
There it is.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.060
The amazon rain forest.

12:19.062 --> 12:23.698
The amazon rain forest
is an incredible place.

12:23.700 --> 12:27.636
A lot of amazing
animal species live there.

12:27.638 --> 12:30.205
Can't wait to get started
on our mission.

12:30.207 --> 12:33.242
The amazon is the largest
tropical rain forest in the world.

12:33.244 --> 12:36.344
There are over 450 reptile
species living here.

12:36.346 --> 12:37.679
That includes snakes.

12:37.681 --> 12:40.415
You should find
plenty of snakes to observe.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.083
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

12:42.085 --> 12:43.352
We'll be waiting
for your report.

12:43.354 --> 12:46.255
See you soon, captain maya.

12:46.257 --> 12:51.260
Snakes make up a large number
of rain forest species.

12:51.262 --> 12:54.295
They include the brightly
colored tree boas,

12:54.297 --> 12:56.732
the venomous parrot snakes,

12:56.734 --> 13:00.703
and the multicolored
but deadly coral snake.

13:00.705 --> 13:03.572
How cool!
Do snakes have ears?

13:03.574 --> 13:08.611
Snakes don't have
external ears or eardrums,

13:08.613 --> 13:12.280
but their skin,
muscles, and bones

13:12.282 --> 13:15.818
carry sound vibrations
to their inner ears.

13:15.820 --> 13:18.154
Wow!

13:18.156 --> 13:20.522
Hey, guys, look over there.
What's that?

13:20.524 --> 13:22.791
That's a pit viper.

13:22.793 --> 13:24.559
A pit viper?

13:24.561 --> 13:27.463
That's correct.

13:27.465 --> 13:29.464
They're called pit vipers

13:29.466 --> 13:31.299
because they have
a special organ

13:31.301 --> 13:33.636
between the eyes
and the nostrils

13:33.638 --> 13:36.639
that senses body heat
from animals.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.574
It helps them locate prey.

13:39.576 --> 13:41.477
Incredible.

13:41.479 --> 13:44.079
What other snakes
live in south america?

13:44.081 --> 13:45.381
Approaching anacondas.

13:45.383 --> 13:47.315
Anacondas?

13:47.317 --> 13:50.785
Anacondas are the
heaviest snake in the world.

13:50.787 --> 13:54.656
It weighs over 595 pounds

13:54.658 --> 13:57.459
and can grow
to over 30 feet long.

13:57.461 --> 14:03.365
It has been known to eat
whole caimans and even jaguars.

14:03.367 --> 14:06.535
Look over there.
I think i see an anaconda.

14:06.537 --> 14:08.804
Let's take
a closer look, sky a.

14:08.806 --> 14:11.640
Approaching anacondas.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.742
Cool space gases!
This is so exciting.

14:14.744 --> 14:17.413
Explorers, go!

14:17.415 --> 14:20.583
Cup-k, what else can
you tell us about anacondas?

14:20.585 --> 14:23.651
Anacondas can hold
their breath under water

14:23.653 --> 14:26.889
for up to 10 minutes.

14:26.891 --> 14:29.391
But that's
no problem for them.

14:29.393 --> 14:31.894
They have eyes and nostrils

14:31.896 --> 14:34.697
that poke above
the water's surface

14:34.699 --> 14:37.867
so they can breathe
while hiding under water.

14:37.869 --> 14:39.334
Look over there.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.469
What beautiful skin.

14:41.471 --> 14:42.872
What's it made of?

14:42.874 --> 14:45.207
Anacondas' skin is made

14:45.209 --> 14:48.176
of small smooth scales.

14:48.178 --> 14:52.314
In fact, their skin
is not slimy at all.

14:52.316 --> 14:58.253
Instead, it's very soft
and pleasant to the touch.

14:58.255 --> 14:59.588
Cool.

14:59.590 --> 15:00.856
Anacondas' skin color

15:00.858 --> 15:02.323
depends on the species,

15:02.325 --> 15:03.858
but whatever their color,

15:03.860 --> 15:06.428
it always blends in
with their tropical background.

15:06.430 --> 15:08.731
Wow, what an amazing creature.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.699
Anaconda jaws
are very stretchy.

15:11.701 --> 15:15.570
It allows them to open
their mouth wide enough

15:15.572 --> 15:18.573
to swallow their prey whole.

15:18.575 --> 15:20.175
Incredible.

15:20.177 --> 15:22.511
Let's go check out
more anacondas.

15:22.513 --> 15:25.247
Look at that one.
It's just amazing.

15:25.249 --> 15:29.617
Cup-k, do anacondas have
hinged fangs like pit vipers?

15:29.619 --> 15:30.920
No, they don't.

15:30.922 --> 15:33.588
Hinged fangs
belong to some types

15:33.590 --> 15:37.593
of venomous snakes,
like vipers and rattlesnakes.

15:37.595 --> 15:40.261
Anacondas are not venomous.

15:40.263 --> 15:44.599
They kill their prey
by squeezing it.

15:44.601 --> 15:49.271
Instead, they have four rows
of backward pointing teeth

15:49.273 --> 15:50.705
on their upper jaw

15:50.707 --> 15:52.775
to allow them to hold on
to their prey

15:52.777 --> 15:55.644
while they swallow it whole.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.279
Whoa.

15:57.281 --> 15:59.714
Hey, i think we might've
just answered

15:59.716 --> 16:01.817
captain maya's
mission question.

16:01.819 --> 16:03.819
Yay!

16:04.854 --> 16:08.756
Space explorers, go!

16:08.758 --> 16:12.761
Space explorers, go!

16:12.763 --> 16:14.530
Fantastic work, gang.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.497
Your mission
was a great success.

16:16.499 --> 16:18.266
Yippee!

16:18.268 --> 16:20.803
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

16:20.805 --> 16:23.472
Yes, captain maya, we did.

16:23.474 --> 16:25.708
Not all snakes
have hinged fangs.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.477
Only some types
of venomous snakes do,

16:28.479 --> 16:30.913
like vipers and rattlesnakes.

16:30.915 --> 16:32.647
That's incredible, team.

16:32.649 --> 16:34.415
You did it. Good work.

16:34.417 --> 16:35.918
Thank you, captain maya.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.886
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

16:37.888 --> 16:39.822
This next mission
is sure to be

16:39.824 --> 16:42.290
your most exciting yet,
space explorers.

16:42.292 --> 16:46.462
Cool space gases!
I love challenges.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.862
I'm always up for one, too.

16:47.864 --> 16:50.498
Well, you two will be
heading back to earth.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.501
- Great. Earth!
- We love earth!

16:53.503 --> 16:55.603
We want you to learn
all about eagles.

16:55.605 --> 16:59.341
Eagles? So fascinating.

16:59.343 --> 17:02.343
This is going to be
our coolest mission yet.

17:02.345 --> 17:04.480
What can you tell us
about eagles, captain maya?

17:04.482 --> 17:07.950
I can tell you that there are about
60 diverse species of eagles.

17:07.952 --> 17:10.752
Most of them are found
in eurasia and africa,

17:10.753 --> 17:13.621
with only 14 species
residing in other areas

17:13.623 --> 17:17.393
like north, central, and
south america and australia.

17:17.395 --> 17:19.461
Wow, i can't wait
to check them out.

17:19.463 --> 17:24.332
Eagles sound absolutely
fascinating.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.403
They are. Eagles are at
the top of the food chain,

17:27.405 --> 17:30.705
with some species feeding on big
prey like monkeys and sloth.

17:30.707 --> 17:33.474
Really? That's awesome,
captain maya.

17:33.476 --> 17:35.844
As you know,
nick and sammy,

17:35.846 --> 17:40.014
every time we send our space explorers
to observe a new earth species,

17:40.016 --> 17:42.651
we ask them to collect
as much data as possible.

17:42.653 --> 17:44.353
- Right.
- We will!

17:44.355 --> 17:46.021
But above all,
there's a question

17:46.023 --> 17:48.389
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

17:48.391 --> 17:50.725
have not been able to answer
about eagles.

17:50.727 --> 17:52.895
We need you two
space explorers

17:52.897 --> 17:55.530
to help us answer the mission
question about eagles.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.732
What's the question?

17:57.734 --> 18:00.001
Do all eagles
have white heads?

18:00.003 --> 18:02.838
That's a very good question,
captain maya.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.473
We'll find the answer,
i promise.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.342
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

18:07.344 --> 18:09.912
will transport you a million
light years to earth

18:09.914 --> 18:11.379
in a quick instant,

18:11.381 --> 18:13.581
and your amazing
helper robot cup-k

18:13.583 --> 18:15.350
will assist you
on your mission.

18:15.352 --> 18:16.652
Off you go.

18:16.654 --> 18:18.587
Space explorers, go!

18:18.589 --> 18:21.893
Space explorers, go!

18:31.635 --> 18:34.669
We are about to reach our
destination, space explorers...

18:34.671 --> 18:37.772
- earth.
- Amazing!

18:37.774 --> 18:39.007
Look at that.

18:39.009 --> 18:42.644
The most beautiful place
in the galaxy.

18:42.646 --> 18:45.716
The coolest planet of all...
earth!

18:54.725 --> 18:56.591
Where are we headed, sky a?

18:56.593 --> 18:58.594
First up, ala ska.

18:58.596 --> 18:59.794
That's where we will find

18:59.796 --> 19:03.030
many amazing species
of eagles.

19:03.032 --> 19:04.665
Ala ska?

19:04.667 --> 19:06.769
I always wanted
to visit ala ska.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.604
Hello, space explorers.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.807
I see you'll be heading to ala ska.
That's awesome.

19:11.809 --> 19:14.809
Cup-k, sky a, please
fill the space explorers in

19:14.811 --> 19:16.744
on some great facts
about ala ska.

19:16.746 --> 19:19.415
Sure, captain maya.

19:19.417 --> 19:22.049
Nick, sammy, did you know

19:22.051 --> 19:23.985
that the kenai river
in ala ska

19:23.987 --> 19:27.655
recorded the largest salmon
to ever be caught,

19:27.657 --> 19:32.126
and it weighed 97.5 pounds?

19:32.128 --> 19:33.861
That's a big salmon.

19:33.863 --> 19:36.831
The town of
talkeetna in ala ska

19:36.833 --> 19:41.169
has had a cat named stubbs
as mayor for 15 years.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.674
Ala ska sounds like
a pretty cool place.

19:46.676 --> 19:50.678
Another interesting fact
about ala ska

19:50.680 --> 19:54.482
is that there are more than
three million lakes there.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.685
Whoa! Three million.

19:57.687 --> 20:00.121
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

20:00.123 --> 20:02.089
We are approaching
earth's exosphere.

20:02.091 --> 20:05.626
Who o... hoo!

20:05.628 --> 20:06.930
Who o-hoo!

20:11.801 --> 20:13.836
We've entered
earth's stratosphere.

20:13.838 --> 20:17.071
Approaching ala ska, the chilkat
valley, to be precise.

20:17.073 --> 20:20.041
- Awesome!
- Cool.

20:20.043 --> 20:22.978
- There it is.
- The chilkat valley.

20:22.980 --> 20:26.147
The chilkat valley
is an incredible place.

20:26.149 --> 20:30.085
A lot of amazing
animal species live there.

20:30.087 --> 20:31.953
Can't wait to get started
on our mission.

20:31.955 --> 20:34.889
The chilkat valley
has the highest concentration

20:34.891 --> 20:36.992
of bald eagles in the world.

20:36.994 --> 20:39.126
You should find
plenty of eagles to observe.

20:39.128 --> 20:41.096
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

20:41.098 --> 20:42.598
We'll be waiting
for your report.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.765
See you soon, captain maya.

20:44.767 --> 20:47.569
Eagles make up
a vast majority

20:47.571 --> 20:49.570
of the chilkat valley
residents

20:49.572 --> 20:51.572
because of
the abundant salmon

20:51.574 --> 20:53.642
in the waters
around this area.

20:53.644 --> 20:56.144
How cool!
Can eagles fly backwards?

20:56.146 --> 20:59.748
Eagles cannot fly backwards.

21:01.017 --> 21:03.886
But they can hover in the air

21:03.888 --> 21:06.655
for a long time

21:06.657 --> 21:10.192
or fly very slowly.

21:10.194 --> 21:12.594
Wow!

21:12.596 --> 21:15.062
Hey, guys, look over there.
What's that?

21:15.064 --> 21:19.568
- That's a bald eagle.
- A bald eagle?

21:19.570 --> 21:21.770
That's correct.

21:21.772 --> 21:23.771
They are called bald eagles

21:23.773 --> 21:26.607
because both
the male and female eagles

21:26.609 --> 21:28.944
have white heads.

21:28.946 --> 21:31.245
The bald eagle
is alaska's largest

21:31.247 --> 21:33.181
resident bird of prey,

21:33.183 --> 21:37.118
with a wingspan
of up to 7.5 feet

21:37.120 --> 21:41.255
and weight between
8 to 14 pounds.

21:41.257 --> 21:43.559
Super cool.

21:43.561 --> 21:45.027
What other eagles
live in ala ska?

21:45.029 --> 21:47.061
Approaching golden eagles.

21:47.063 --> 21:48.896
Golden eagles?

21:48.898 --> 21:51.133
Golden eagles
are one of the best known

21:51.135 --> 21:54.636
birds of prey
in the northern hemisphere.

21:54.638 --> 21:57.806
The golden eagle
is long-lived,

21:57.808 --> 22:02.610
with a life span of about
38 years in the wild

22:02.612 --> 22:05.146
and about 50 years
in captivity.

22:05.148 --> 22:08.082
Look over there!
I think i see a golden eagle.

22:08.084 --> 22:10.284
Let's take
a closer look, sky a.

22:10.286 --> 22:11.819
Approaching.

22:11.821 --> 22:14.889
Cool space gasses!
This is so exciting.

22:14.891 --> 22:17.658
Explorers, go!

22:17.660 --> 22:21.229
Cup-k, what else can you tell
us about golden eagles?

22:21.231 --> 22:25.600
Golden eagles are monogamous
and may mate for life.

22:25.602 --> 22:27.168
Look over there.

22:27.170 --> 22:30.672
They have very large wings.

22:30.674 --> 22:32.640
How fast can they fly?

22:32.642 --> 22:35.844
Golden eagles
are extremely swift

22:35.846 --> 22:38.012
and can reach
a maximum air speed

22:38.014 --> 22:41.683
of 200 miles per hour.

22:41.685 --> 22:42.951
Cool!

22:42.953 --> 22:44.853
Male and female golden eagles

22:44.855 --> 22:46.855
take turns incubating
their eggs,

22:46.857 --> 22:49.324
with one eagle sitting
on the nest

22:49.326 --> 22:52.394
while the other
provides the food.

22:52.396 --> 22:55.062
Well, that is pretty amazing.

22:55.064 --> 22:58.200
Golden eagles
have superb eyesight

22:58.202 --> 23:02.337
that allows them
to easily track down prey.

23:02.339 --> 23:05.206
They can swoop down
on their prey

23:05.208 --> 23:08.876
at speeds of 150 miles
per hour.

23:08.878 --> 23:12.246
And the striking force
of their powerful talons

23:12.248 --> 23:15.082
has been compared
to the force of a bullet.

23:15.084 --> 23:16.818
How cool.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.988
Let's go check out
more golden eagles.

23:19.990 --> 23:22.424
Look at that one.
It's so regal.

23:22.426 --> 23:24.893
Hey, cup-k,
do golden eagles

23:24.895 --> 23:28.096
have white heads
like bald eagles?

23:28.098 --> 23:29.731
No, they don't.

23:29.733 --> 23:31.899
White heads can only be found

23:31.901 --> 23:36.805
on certain kinds of eagles,
like the bald eagle.

23:36.807 --> 23:39.741
Golden eagles
do not have white heads.

23:39.743 --> 23:42.743
They have golden brown plumes
on their head and neck.

23:42.745 --> 23:45.847
- Whoa!
- Hey, i think we might've

23:45.849 --> 23:48.684
just answered captain maya's
mission question.

23:48.686 --> 23:54.056
- Yay!
- Space explorers, go!

23:54.058 --> 23:58.960
- Space explorers, go!
- Fantastic work, gang.

23:58.962 --> 24:00.828
Your mission
was a great success.

24:00.830 --> 24:02.931
All right!

24:02.933 --> 24:05.800
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

24:05.802 --> 24:08.169
Yes, captain maya, we did.

24:08.171 --> 24:10.405
Not all eagles
have white heads.

24:10.407 --> 24:14.376
Only some types of eagles do,
like the bald eagle.

24:14.378 --> 24:17.812
That's very cool, team.
You did it. Good job.

24:17.814 --> 24:20.715
This is sure to be your most
fascinating mission yet,

24:20.717 --> 24:22.084
young space explorers.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.051
Cool space gases!

24:24.053 --> 24:25.953
I love going on missions.

24:25.955 --> 24:27.856
Yeah, me, too.

24:27.858 --> 24:29.491
Well, i'm happy to report

24:29.493 --> 24:32.860
you two will be heading back to
your favorite planet... earth.

24:32.862 --> 24:34.428
So happy!

24:34.430 --> 24:36.263
We love earth.

24:36.265 --> 24:38.867
We want you to learn
all about tortoises.

24:38.869 --> 24:42.037
Tortoises?
They're so cool.

24:42.039 --> 24:43.905
Very exciting!

24:43.907 --> 24:46.841
This is going to be
our most amazing mission

24:46.843 --> 24:49.176
in the whole wide universe,
sammy.

24:49.178 --> 24:52.114
What can you tell us about
tortoises, captain maya?

24:52.116 --> 24:54.148
I can tell you that tortoises

24:54.150 --> 24:56.451
are the longest-living
land animal in the world.

24:56.453 --> 24:58.819
They have the same
life span as humans,

24:58.821 --> 25:03.258
and some tortoises can live
from 90 to 150 years.

25:03.260 --> 25:04.992
Really? Wow.

25:04.994 --> 25:06.228
I can't wait
to check them out.

25:06.230 --> 25:09.865
Tortoises
are truly fascinating.

25:09.867 --> 25:13.467
They are. Tortoises
are the ultimate conservationists.

25:13.469 --> 25:15.337
They can extract
water and nutrients

25:15.339 --> 25:17.004
from even the smallest bites.

25:17.006 --> 25:18.339
Their hind gut system

25:18.341 --> 25:20.442
works like
a double digestive tract,

25:20.444 --> 25:22.344
separating water
from their waste.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.311
Amazing, captain maya.

25:24.313 --> 25:26.013
As you know, nick and sammy,

25:26.015 --> 25:28.015
every time we send
our space explorers

25:28.017 --> 25:30.018
to observe
a new earth species,

25:30.020 --> 25:32.854
we ask them to collect
as much data as possible.

25:32.856 --> 25:34.088
Absolutely.

25:34.090 --> 25:35.357
We will.

25:35.359 --> 25:37.192
But, above all,
there's a question

25:37.194 --> 25:39.293
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

25:39.295 --> 25:41.863
have not been able
to answer about tortoises.

25:41.865 --> 25:43.964
We need you two
space explorers

25:43.966 --> 25:46.902
to help us answer the mission
question about tortoises.

25:46.904 --> 25:48.970
What question is that,
captain maya?

25:48.972 --> 25:50.504
Do tortoises swim?

25:50.506 --> 25:52.874
Can't wait to find out.

25:52.876 --> 25:54.975
We'll find the answer for you,
captain maya.

25:54.977 --> 25:56.944
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

25:56.946 --> 25:59.213
will transport you a million
light years to earth

25:59.215 --> 26:00.816
faster than lightning,

26:00.818 --> 26:02.884
and your trusty
robot helper cup-k

26:02.886 --> 26:04.386
will assist you
on your mission.

26:04.388 --> 26:08.356
- Off you go.
- Space explorers, go!

26:08.358 --> 26:10.194
Space explorers, go!

26:20.070 --> 26:23.538
We are about to reach our
destination, space explorers...

26:23.540 --> 26:26.607
- earth.
- Yes! We're ready.

26:26.609 --> 26:29.511
The most beautiful place ever.

26:29.513 --> 26:31.413
You guys are correct.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.949
We're gonna have a blast.

26:33.951 --> 26:35.416
Where are we headed, sky a?

26:35.418 --> 26:37.484
First stop, california.

26:37.486 --> 26:38.986
That's where we will find

26:38.988 --> 26:42.456
many fascinating species
of tortoises.

26:42.458 --> 26:46.861
California? Lovely place.

26:46.863 --> 26:49.097
I always wanted
to visit california.

26:49.099 --> 26:50.932
Hello, space explorers.

26:50.934 --> 26:53.100
I see you'll be heading
to california.

26:53.102 --> 26:55.103
Very well. Cup-k, sky a,

26:55.105 --> 26:56.570
please fill
the space explorers in

26:56.572 --> 26:58.940
on some amazing facts
about california.

26:58.942 --> 27:01.443
Sure, captain maya.

27:01.445 --> 27:05.446
Nick, sammy, did you know
that the san bernardino county

27:05.448 --> 27:08.582
is that largest county
in the united states

27:08.584 --> 27:11.286
in terms of land area?

27:11.288 --> 27:16.156
It is larger than
nine u.s. states combined.

27:16.158 --> 27:18.659
What? That's incredible.

27:18.661 --> 27:21.596
Methuselah,
a bristle cone pine tree

27:21.598 --> 27:23.964
from california's
white mountains

27:23.966 --> 27:29.136
is the oldest non-clonal still
standing tree in the world.

27:29.138 --> 27:34.943
It's estimated
to be 4,650 years old.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.610
4,000 years old?

27:36.612 --> 27:39.481
I never knew trees
could live that long.

27:39.483 --> 27:44.485
Another interesting fact
about california

27:44.487 --> 27:47.489
is that hyper ion,
a coast redwood tree

27:47.491 --> 27:51.158
in the redwood
national park, california,

27:51.160 --> 27:55.262
is the tallest living tree
in the world

27:55.264 --> 27:58.700
at 377 feet.

27:58.702 --> 28:00.969
Amazing.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.370
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

28:03.372 --> 28:05.607
We are approaching
earth's exosphere.

28:05.609 --> 28:11.346
- Who o... hoo!
- Who o-hoo!

28:11.348 --> 28:13.348
We've entered stratosphere.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.183
Approaching california...

28:15.185 --> 28:17.418
the california desert,
to be exact.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.186
Awesome.

28:19.188 --> 28:20.488
Cool space sand!

28:20.490 --> 28:23.226
The california desert!

28:24.224 --> 28:28.663
The california desert
is a pretty cool place.

28:28.665 --> 28:33.001
A lot of amazing
animal species live there.

28:33.003 --> 28:35.069
Can't wait to get started
on our mission.

28:35.071 --> 28:37.504
The california desert area
sees little rainfall,

28:37.506 --> 28:40.241
which makes it a difficult
growing place for plants,

28:40.243 --> 28:43.211
but you should find plenty
of tortoises to observe.

28:43.213 --> 28:45.213
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

28:45.215 --> 28:46.748
We'll be waiting
for your report.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.117
Yes, ma'am, captain maya.

28:49.119 --> 28:52.386
The mojave desert
in california's desert region

28:52.388 --> 28:57.224
contains the famous
death valley.

28:57.226 --> 28:59.059
Death valley
is considered to be

28:59.061 --> 29:04.398
north america's hottest,
driest, and lowest region.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.467
That sounds harsh.

29:06.469 --> 29:09.570
Say, cup-k, are tortoises
nocturnal animals?

29:09.572 --> 29:13.074
Tortoises are
not nocturnal animals.

29:13.076 --> 29:15.109
They are diurnal animals,

29:15.111 --> 29:18.379
which means they are active
during the day.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.681
I see.

29:19.683 --> 29:22.416
We should spot
lots of them then.

29:22.418 --> 29:25.252
Hey, guys, look over there.
What's that?

29:25.254 --> 29:29.124
That's a mojave
desert tortoise.

29:29.126 --> 29:31.259
A mojave desert tortoise?

29:31.261 --> 29:32.559
That's correct.

29:32.561 --> 29:35.496
They are called mojave
desert tortoises

29:35.498 --> 29:40.367
because they are native to the
mojave desert area in california.

29:40.369 --> 29:41.603
The mojave desert tortoise

29:41.605 --> 29:47.107
can survive one year
without water.

29:47.109 --> 29:50.278
They absorb water
from the vegetation they eat,

29:50.280 --> 29:52.680
and dig shallow pools
in the ground

29:52.682 --> 29:55.582
to collect rainwater!

29:55.584 --> 29:57.318
That's very clever.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.521
What other tortoises
live in california?

30:00.523 --> 30:03.090
Approaching
sonoran desert tortoise.

30:03.092 --> 30:06.761
Sonoran desert tortoise!
How cute.

30:06.763 --> 30:10.298
Sonoran desert tortoises
have strong,

30:10.300 --> 30:14.135
heavily scaled front legs
equipped with sharp claws

30:14.137 --> 30:17.806
that are use for digging
underground burrows.

30:17.808 --> 30:22.476
These animals spend
more than 95 % of their life

30:22.478 --> 30:24.479
under the ground.

30:24.481 --> 30:25.847
Look over there.

30:25.849 --> 30:28.082
I think i see
a sonoran desert tortoise.

30:28.084 --> 30:29.783
Let's check it out, sky a.

30:29.785 --> 30:32.153
- Approaching.
- Cool space sand!

30:32.155 --> 30:36.257
- This is great!
- Explorers, go!

30:36.259 --> 30:37.791
Cup-k, what else
can you tell us

30:37.793 --> 30:40.328
about the sonoran
desert tortoise?

30:40.330 --> 30:45.366
The sonoran desert
tortoise is flat and pear-shaped.

30:45.368 --> 30:47.601
It is more active in summer,

30:47.603 --> 30:51.772
and seeks shade under
large rocks and boulders.

30:51.774 --> 30:53.575
Look over there!

30:53.577 --> 30:56.743
What stubby feet.
What are they used for?

30:56.745 --> 30:58.680
The sonoran desert tortoise

30:58.682 --> 31:00.848
has four limbs
that are flattened

31:00.850 --> 31:05.819
with well-developed muscles
and used for digging burrows,

31:05.821 --> 31:09.857
while the females use their
hind limbs to dig their nests.

31:09.859 --> 31:11.759
They're adorable.

31:11.761 --> 31:13.595
Sonoran desert tortoises

31:13.597 --> 31:16.865
make hisses, pops,
and p oink sounds

31:16.867 --> 31:19.533
for fear and distress calls.

31:19.535 --> 31:21.301
Males grunt when mating.

31:21.303 --> 31:23.338
Totally amazing creatures.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.374
Did you guys know
that sonoran tortoises

31:26.376 --> 31:30.278
live in rock crevices
on deep slopes and hilltops?

31:30.280 --> 31:32.614
- Incredible!
- Let's go find more

31:32.616 --> 31:34.515
sonoran desert tortoises.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.384
Look at that one.

31:36.386 --> 31:37.886
Very cool, little guy.

31:37.888 --> 31:41.422
Hey, cup-k, do sonoran
desert tortoises swim?

31:41.424 --> 31:45.559
No, they don't.
They do not have webbed feet.

31:45.561 --> 31:50.932
Rather, their feet are round
and stumpy for walking on land.

31:50.934 --> 31:53.201
- Whoa.
- Hey!

31:53.203 --> 31:54.801
I think we might've
just answered

31:54.803 --> 31:56.738
captain maya's
mission question.

31:56.740 --> 31:58.239
Yeah, that's great!

31:58.241 --> 32:01.509
Space explorers, go!

32:01.511 --> 32:05.413
Space explorers, go!

32:05.415 --> 32:09.250
Fantastic work, gang.
Your mission was a success.

32:09.252 --> 32:10.818
We did our best,
captain maya.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.588
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

32:13.590 --> 32:16.257
Yes, captain maya, we did.

32:16.259 --> 32:18.492
Tortoises do not have
webbed feet.

32:18.494 --> 32:20.828
Therefore, they cannot swim.

32:20.830 --> 32:23.197
Their feet are made
to dig in the ground.

32:23.199 --> 32:24.566
That's awesome, team.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.501
You did it.
I'm very proud of you.

32:26.503 --> 32:28.536
Thank you, captain maya.

32:28.538 --> 32:30.305
What's our next mission,
captain?

32:30.307 --> 32:32.440
Your next mission
is taking you to canada

32:32.442 --> 32:34.709
to observe
a species known as deer.

32:34.711 --> 32:37.979
Deers?
They are very cute.

32:37.981 --> 32:40.915
This is going to be a fun one,
young space explorers.

32:40.917 --> 32:43.717
Oh, really?
What's it about?

32:43.719 --> 32:45.787
Yeah, where are we going,
captain maya?

32:45.789 --> 32:48.790
I'm excited to report you two
will be heading back to earth.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.626
It's going to be amazing.

32:51.628 --> 32:53.360
We love going there.

32:53.362 --> 32:55.597
We want you to learn
all about deer.

32:55.599 --> 32:59.233
Deers?
They're adorable.

32:59.235 --> 33:01.703
This is going to be
an amazing mission.

33:01.705 --> 33:04.239
What can you tell us about deer,
captain maya?

33:04.241 --> 33:06.640
I can tell you that the deer
is an herbivore

33:06.642 --> 33:08.309
and lives in dark forests.

33:08.311 --> 33:10.712
They occur naturally
in every region,

33:10.714 --> 33:13.481
except australia
and antarctic a.

33:13.483 --> 33:15.683
Six species of deer
were introduced

33:15.685 --> 33:17.751
into the australian woodlands
in the 19th century.

33:17.753 --> 33:20.722
Wow, i can't wait to check
and observe them.

33:20.724 --> 33:24.358
Deer sound totally
fascinating.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.995
Absolutely. Deer have an
extraordinary sense of smell.

33:27.997 --> 33:30.732
They can smell food
from very long distances.

33:30.734 --> 33:33.001
Really? That's pretty
amazing, captain maya.

33:33.003 --> 33:35.302
Every time we send
our space explorers

33:35.304 --> 33:37.038
to observe
a new earth species,

33:37.040 --> 33:39.540
we ask them to collect
as much data as possible.

33:39.542 --> 33:43.377
- You can count on us.
- We won't let you down.

33:43.379 --> 33:44.678
What do you need to know?

33:44.680 --> 33:46.446
Can a deer swim?

33:46.448 --> 33:49.951
That's a very important question
to answer, captain maya.

33:49.953 --> 33:51.618
We'll find out
whether deer swim or not.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.721
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

33:53.723 --> 33:55.623
will transport you
a million light years

33:55.625 --> 33:56.991
to earth in an instant,

33:56.993 --> 33:59.293
and your trusty
helper robot cup-k

33:59.295 --> 34:00.395
will assist you
on your mission.

34:00.397 --> 34:01.462
Off you go.

34:01.464 --> 34:03.630
Space explorers, go!

34:03.632 --> 34:07.303
Space explorers, go!

34:17.380 --> 34:20.648
We are about to reach our
destination, space explorers...

34:20.650 --> 34:23.050
- earth.
- So pretty.

34:23.052 --> 34:26.054
The most beautiful
planet of all.

34:26.056 --> 34:30.425
We're going to learn
so much, guys.

34:30.427 --> 34:31.992
Where are we headed, sky a?

34:31.994 --> 34:33.795
First stop, australia.

34:33.797 --> 34:35.096
That's where we will find

34:35.098 --> 34:38.333
many fascinating species
of deer.

34:38.335 --> 34:41.469
Australia? Yes!

34:41.471 --> 34:42.936
I love australia.

34:42.938 --> 34:44.739
Hello, space explorers.

34:44.741 --> 34:47.641
I see you'll be heading
to australia. How exciting.

34:47.643 --> 34:50.578
Cup-k, sky a, please fill
the space explorers in

34:50.580 --> 34:52.679
on some amazing facts
about australia.

34:52.681 --> 34:55.583
Sure, captain maya.

34:55.585 --> 34:58.585
Nick, sammy,
did you know that australia

34:58.587 --> 35:01.054
has a range
of different landscapes,

35:01.056 --> 35:03.757
including urban areas,

35:03.759 --> 35:05.759
mountain ranges,

35:05.761 --> 35:09.063
deserts, and rain forests?

35:09.065 --> 35:11.599
The world's largest reef,

35:11.601 --> 35:13.768
the great barrier reef,

35:13.770 --> 35:17.771
is located off the northeastern
coast of australia.

35:17.773 --> 35:20.074
Whoa, that's incredible.

35:20.076 --> 35:25.612
Australia has over 750
different reptile species,

35:25.614 --> 35:28.782
more than any other country
in the world,

35:28.784 --> 35:32.786
including the brown snake,
tiger snake, and taipan.

35:32.788 --> 35:35.889
I never knew australia
had so many snakes.

35:35.891 --> 35:37.824
I love snakes.

35:37.826 --> 35:41.929
Another interesting fact
about australia

35:41.931 --> 35:43.998
is that it is home
to marsupials

35:44.000 --> 35:47.701
like koalas, quokkas,
and kangaroos,

35:47.703 --> 35:51.973
that cannot be found
anywhere else in the world.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.741
What an incredible place.

35:53.743 --> 35:56.110
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.145
We are approaching
earth's exosphere.

35:58.147 --> 36:00.815
Who o... hoo!

36:00.817 --> 36:02.784
Who o-hoo!

36:02.786 --> 36:04.985
We have entered
earth's stratosphere.

36:04.987 --> 36:06.686
Approaching australia,

36:06.688 --> 36:09.157
the grampian ranges
of victoria, to be exact.

36:09.159 --> 36:11.992
It's so beautiful.

36:11.994 --> 36:15.929
Yeah, totally grand!
Here we are.

36:15.931 --> 36:18.532
The grampian ranges
of victoria?

36:18.534 --> 36:21.134
The grampian ranges of victoria

36:21.136 --> 36:25.139
is a pretty awesome place.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.708
A lot of amazing
animal species live there.

36:28.710 --> 36:30.578
Can't wait to get started
on our mission.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.512
The grampian ranges

36:32.514 --> 36:35.148
is the third largest
national park in victoria,

36:35.150 --> 36:37.684
and one of the most visited
places in the state.

36:37.686 --> 36:39.954
You should find plenty
of deer to observe.

36:39.956 --> 36:41.721
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

36:41.723 --> 36:43.590
We'll be waiting
for your report.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.025
Yes, captain maya.

36:45.027 --> 36:47.494
Deer make up a large part

36:47.496 --> 36:48.728
of the animal population

36:48.730 --> 36:51.032
in the grampian ranges
of victoria.

36:51.034 --> 36:54.869
There are about six
different species of deer

36:54.871 --> 36:58.206
wandering the woodlands
and forest areas.

36:58.208 --> 37:00.708
How cool! Do deer have horns?

37:00.710 --> 37:02.710
Deer don't have horns.

37:02.712 --> 37:05.880
But they have antlers!

37:05.882 --> 37:07.882
Which are horn-like growths,

37:07.884 --> 37:10.717
mostly found on male deer.

37:10.719 --> 37:12.052
Wow.

37:12.054 --> 37:13.587
Hey, guys, look over there.

37:13.589 --> 37:15.223
What's that animal?

37:15.225 --> 37:17.058
That's a red deer.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.728
A red deer? So pretty.

37:20.730 --> 37:22.730
Yes, it is.

37:22.732 --> 37:25.199
Only male red deer,
or stags,

37:25.201 --> 37:27.735
as they're called,
have antlers,

37:27.737 --> 37:31.204
which are shed every spring
and regrown.

37:31.206 --> 37:33.708
Deer antlers
are living tissues

37:33.710 --> 37:35.576
covered with thick covering

37:35.578 --> 37:39.212
of a protective layer
called velvet.

37:39.214 --> 37:42.916
Man is the only threat
to the red deer.

37:42.918 --> 37:45.920
No other predator
tries to harm these animals

37:45.922 --> 37:47.922
because of their size.

37:47.924 --> 37:53.226
A stag can weigh up
to 400 pounds.

37:53.228 --> 37:54.728
That's pretty big.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.764
What other deer species
live in australia?

37:56.766 --> 37:58.299
Approaching fallow deer.

37:58.301 --> 37:59.967
Fallow deer?

37:59.969 --> 38:03.237
Originally a
eurasian species of deer,

38:03.239 --> 38:06.940
the fallow deer
is now widely scattered

38:06.942 --> 38:11.212
throughout australia,
europe, and asia.

38:11.214 --> 38:14.581
It is also found in some parts
of the middle east,

38:14.583 --> 38:19.719
the mediterranean,
and the united states.

38:19.721 --> 38:22.123
Look over there!
I think i see a fallow deer.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.190
Let's take a
closer look, sky a.

38:24.192 --> 38:27.128
- Approaching.
- This is totally exciting.

38:27.130 --> 38:30.197
Explorers, go!

38:30.199 --> 38:33.333
Cup-k, what else can you tell us
about the fallow deer?

38:33.335 --> 38:37.270
The average life span
of fallow deer in the wild

38:37.272 --> 38:41.976
ranges between 12
and 16 years.

38:41.978 --> 38:45.645
And the longest recorded
life span of fallow deer

38:45.647 --> 38:50.284
is 25 years in captivity.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.652
Look! Over there!

38:52.654 --> 38:54.822
What beautiful spots.

38:54.824 --> 38:56.623
Are they born that way?

38:56.625 --> 39:00.161
The fallow deer are one
of the few species of deer

39:00.163 --> 39:05.266
that don't lose their spots
a few months after birth.

39:05.268 --> 39:09.670
They actually have
two different color phases...

39:09.672 --> 39:12.940
a summer phase
and a winter phase.

39:12.942 --> 39:15.076
Very elegant.

39:15.078 --> 39:17.844
Fallow deer
have very sharp vision.

39:17.846 --> 39:19.980
They can see
the minutest details

39:19.982 --> 39:21.782
at great distances.

39:21.784 --> 39:24.985
Really?
Who need binoculars?

39:24.987 --> 39:29.857
The call of the fallow deer
is called groaning,

39:29.859 --> 39:33.194
and it sounds
a lot like burping.

39:34.931 --> 39:37.732
Eww.

39:37.734 --> 39:39.866
Let's go visit
more fallow deer.

39:39.868 --> 39:43.337
Look at that one. How regal.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.373
Hey, cup-k, can deer swim?

39:46.375 --> 39:48.208
Yes, they do.

39:48.210 --> 39:51.712
Actually,
all deer species can swim,

39:51.714 --> 39:55.215
even in very deep waters.

39:55.217 --> 39:57.884
No way! Really?

39:57.886 --> 39:59.820
Hey, sammy, i think
we might've just answered

39:59.822 --> 40:01.721
captain maya's
mission question.

40:01.723 --> 40:03.724
We did? Great!

40:03.726 --> 40:05.358
Space explorers, go!

40:05.360 --> 40:09.230
Space explorers, go!

40:09.232 --> 40:12.233
Fantastic work, gang.
Your mission was a success.

40:12.235 --> 40:14.402
So happy to hear it,
captain maya.

40:14.404 --> 40:16.837
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

40:16.839 --> 40:19.306
You bet, captain maya. We did.

40:19.308 --> 40:23.344
All deer species can swim,
even in deep waters.

40:23.346 --> 40:25.179
That's great, team.
You did it.

40:25.181 --> 40:26.980
Thank you, captain maya.

40:26.982 --> 40:28.916
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

40:28.918 --> 40:30.684
This next mission
is sure to be

40:30.686 --> 40:32.686
your most fun yet,
space explorers.

40:32.688 --> 40:35.355
Oh, yeah? I love it.

40:35.357 --> 40:37.257
I'm always up
for a fun mission.

40:37.259 --> 40:39.259
This is going to be
a pretty incredible mission,

40:39.261 --> 40:40.761
young space explorers.

40:40.763 --> 40:42.096
Well, i'm excited to report,

40:42.098 --> 40:43.831
you two will be heading
back to earth.

40:43.833 --> 40:47.367
- Awesome. Earth!
- We love earth.

40:47.369 --> 40:50.170
We want you to learn
all about crocodiles.

40:50.172 --> 40:54.175
Crocodiles?
Sounds dangerous.

40:54.177 --> 40:55.976
And a lot of fun.

40:55.978 --> 40:58.311
What can you tell us about
crocodiles, captain maya?

40:58.313 --> 41:00.780
I can tell you
that crocodiles

41:00.782 --> 41:03.150
are large reptiles
that live in fresh water,

41:03.152 --> 41:05.119
lakes, rivers,
and brackish water.

41:05.121 --> 41:07.788
They can be found
in tropic areas of australia,

41:07.790 --> 41:09.956
africa, america, and asia.

41:09.958 --> 41:12.025
There are 23 species
of crocodiles,

41:12.027 --> 41:15.029
and most of them are endangered
because of poaching.

41:15.031 --> 41:17.797
Wow, i can't wait to check
those guys out.

41:17.799 --> 41:21.101
Crocodiles sound like
incredible creatures.

41:21.103 --> 41:23.304
They are. Crocodiles
have lived on the earth

41:23.306 --> 41:25.438
for 240 million years.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.041
They appeared about the same
time when dinosaurs appeared.

41:28.043 --> 41:30.511
What? That's incredible,
captain maya.

41:30.513 --> 41:32.145
As you know,
nick and sammy,

41:32.147 --> 41:34.280
every time we send
our space explorers

41:34.282 --> 41:36.317
to observe
a new earth species,

41:36.319 --> 41:39.085
we ask them to collect as much
information as possible.

41:39.087 --> 41:40.420
Yep. Got that.

41:40.422 --> 41:42.389
We will, captain maya.

41:42.391 --> 41:44.157
But above all,
there's a question

41:44.159 --> 41:46.159
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

41:46.161 --> 41:48.996
have not been able
to answer about crocodiles.

41:48.998 --> 41:50.831
We need you two
space explorers

41:50.833 --> 41:53.300
to help us answer the
mission question about them.

41:53.302 --> 41:56.436
Okay, cool.
What's the question?

41:56.438 --> 41:59.340
Do crocodiles really cry
crocodile tears?

41:59.342 --> 42:05.145
Whoa! That's a very strange
question, captain maya.

42:05.147 --> 42:07.514
We'll find the answer.
I'm sure of it.

42:07.516 --> 42:09.849
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

42:09.851 --> 42:12.018
will transport you a million
light years to earth

42:12.020 --> 42:13.320
in a shake
of a lamb's tail.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.855
And your trusty
helper robot cup-k

42:15.857 --> 42:17.190
will assist you
on your mission.

42:17.192 --> 42:19.860
- Off your go.
- Space explorers, go!

42:19.862 --> 42:23.166
Space explorers, go!

42:33.208 --> 42:34.474
We are about to reach

42:34.476 --> 42:37.210
our destination,
space explorers... earth.

42:37.212 --> 42:39.980
Amazing planet!

42:39.982 --> 42:44.217
The most beautiful planet
in all the universe.

42:44.219 --> 42:47.256
I love this place!

42:56.933 --> 42:58.532
Where are we headed, sky a?

42:58.534 --> 43:00.534
First stop, florid a.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.069
That's where we will find

43:02.071 --> 43:05.572
many fascinating species
of crocodiles.

43:05.574 --> 43:07.875
Florid a?
I've heard of that.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.344
I always wanted
to check out florid a.

43:10.346 --> 43:12.246
Hello, space explorers.

43:12.248 --> 43:14.081
I see you'll be
heading to florid a,

43:14.083 --> 43:16.916
a very interesting place
to observe nature.

43:16.918 --> 43:20.087
Cup-k, sky a, please
fill the space explorers in

43:20.089 --> 43:22.188
on some amazing facts
about florid a.

43:22.190 --> 43:23.991
Sure, captain maya.

43:23.993 --> 43:27.094
Nick, sammy,
did you know that florid a

43:27.096 --> 43:30.264
is the largest producer
of citrus fruit

43:30.266 --> 43:32.266
in the united states?

43:32.268 --> 43:35.936
It produces
the majority of oranges,

43:35.938 --> 43:38.572
tangerines, and grapefruit

43:38.574 --> 43:41.275
cultivated
in the united states.

43:41.277 --> 43:45.112
About 90 % of the citrus
harvested in florid a

43:45.114 --> 43:48.148
goes into juice-making!

43:48.150 --> 43:49.583
That's pretty cool.

43:49.585 --> 43:51.384
The port of miami in florid a

43:51.386 --> 43:55.588
is the world's largest
cruise ship port.

43:55.590 --> 43:59.092
With 663 miles
of fine beaches,

43:59.094 --> 44:02.462
it is a vacationer's
paradise.

44:02.464 --> 44:04.965
Cruise ships? Beaches?

44:04.967 --> 44:08.636
Sounds dreamy.

44:08.638 --> 44:12.605
Another interesting fact
about florid a

44:12.607 --> 44:17.610
is that south florid a
is the only place in the world

44:17.612 --> 44:21.315
where alligators
and crocodiles

44:21.317 --> 44:23.050
coexist in the wild.

44:23.052 --> 44:26.686
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

44:26.688 --> 44:29.088
We are approaching
earth's exosphere.

44:29.090 --> 44:33.192
Who o-hoo-hoo! Who o!

44:33.194 --> 44:34.162
Who o-hoo!

44:36.699 --> 44:39.166
We've entered
earth's stratosphere.

44:39.168 --> 44:42.536
Approaching florid a...
the everglades, to be precise.

44:42.538 --> 44:44.371
Everglades?

44:44.373 --> 44:47.107
- Awesome.
- Can't wait!

44:47.109 --> 44:49.476
- There it is.
- The everglades.

44:49.478 --> 44:54.315
The everglades
is a fascinating place.

44:54.317 --> 44:58.451
A lot of very unique
animal species live there.

44:58.453 --> 45:00.487
I'm itching to get started
on our mission.

45:00.489 --> 45:03.023
The florid a panther
and the crocodile

45:03.025 --> 45:04.625
are just two
of the endangered animals

45:04.627 --> 45:07.194
the everglades
ecosystem protects.

45:07.196 --> 45:10.530
It is also home to over
16 species of birds,

45:10.532 --> 45:13.132
a variety of mammals,
reptiles, and plants.

45:13.134 --> 45:16.369
You should find plenty
of crocodiles to check out.

45:16.371 --> 45:18.137
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

45:18.139 --> 45:20.139
We'll be waiting
for your report.

45:20.141 --> 45:22.308
See you soon, captain maya.

45:22.310 --> 45:25.045
Hey, guys!
Check this out.

45:25.047 --> 45:28.382
Crocodiles are mostly found
in small numbers

45:28.384 --> 45:31.050
in coastal areas
of the glades.

45:31.052 --> 45:34.989
The everglades ecosystem
provides a natural habitat

45:34.991 --> 45:38.558
for american crocodiles,
american alligator,

45:38.560 --> 45:40.594
and nile crocodiles.

45:40.596 --> 45:44.230
How interesting.
Look at those guys.

45:44.232 --> 45:46.666
Say, cup-k,
do crocodiles sweat?

45:46.668 --> 45:48.701
No, they don't!

45:48.703 --> 45:52.139
Crocodiles
do not have sweat glands,

45:52.141 --> 45:54.407
so they don't sweat.

45:54.409 --> 45:58.645
Rather, they open their jaws
to cool themselves.

45:58.647 --> 46:01.348
Oh, yeah, i see that.

46:01.350 --> 46:03.116
What's that guy over there?

46:03.118 --> 46:05.552
That's an american crocodile.

46:05.554 --> 46:09.255
- An american crocodile?
- That's right.

46:09.257 --> 46:12.092
American crocodiles
are considered to be

46:12.094 --> 46:16.429
one of the most perfect
creatures in the world.

46:16.431 --> 46:21.601
Besides being by far the most
biologically complex reptile,

46:21.603 --> 46:27.574
they have the strongest immunity
system of all creatures.

46:27.576 --> 46:31.445
The crocodile feeds
primarily on fish,

46:31.447 --> 46:34.782
but will eat crustaceans,
turtles,

46:34.784 --> 46:37.583
and occasionally
birds and mammals.

46:37.585 --> 46:39.652
Sounds like
a pretty cool species.

46:39.654 --> 46:42.623
What other crocodiles
live in florid a?

46:42.625 --> 46:45.259
Approaching nile crocodile.

46:45.261 --> 46:48.262
Nile crocodile?
Tell us more, cup-k.

46:48.264 --> 46:50.063
The nile crocodile

46:50.065 --> 46:54.567
is one of africa's
deadliest predators!

46:54.569 --> 46:57.637
This crocodile species
has recently migrated

46:57.639 --> 46:59.473
to the florid a swamps.

46:59.475 --> 47:02.308
This huge reptile

47:02.310 --> 47:05.478
is capable of taking down
pretty much any animal

47:05.480 --> 47:09.083
that ventures too close
to its watery domain.

47:10.319 --> 47:12.719
Scary!
Hey, look over there.

47:12.721 --> 47:15.154
I think i see
a nile crocodile.

47:15.156 --> 47:18.157
Let's take
a closer look, sky a.

47:18.159 --> 47:20.159
Cool space gases!

47:20.161 --> 47:21.561
This is so cool.

47:21.563 --> 47:24.230
Explorers, go!

47:24.232 --> 47:27.701
Cup-k, what else can you tell us
about the nile crocodile?

47:27.703 --> 47:32.505
The nile crocodile is
the second largest

47:32.507 --> 47:34.675
crocodile in the world,

47:34.677 --> 47:39.346
and can grow up to
six meters long.

47:39.348 --> 47:42.349
Only the saltwater
crocodile is bigger.

47:42.351 --> 47:43.717
Check out over there.

47:43.719 --> 47:46.487
What beautiful skin.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.188
What is their skin made of?

47:48.190 --> 47:50.357
The nile crocodile's skin

47:50.359 --> 47:52.625
is covered with tough scales

47:52.627 --> 47:55.362
and bony plates called s cutes.

47:55.364 --> 47:58.699
They line its back and tail.

47:58.701 --> 48:02.703
The nile crocodile
is dark olive green in color,

48:02.705 --> 48:06.405
and its underbelly
is yellowish white.

48:06.407 --> 48:07.708
Pretty cool.

48:07.710 --> 48:09.809
The nile crocodile's eyes,

48:09.811 --> 48:11.545
ears, and nostrils

48:11.547 --> 48:14.380
are located
on the top of its head.

48:14.382 --> 48:16.483
This enables
the nile crocodile

48:16.485 --> 48:18.851
to remain
almost fully submerged

48:18.853 --> 48:20.554
while still being aware

48:20.556 --> 48:23.223
of everything going on
above the water.

48:23.225 --> 48:24.791
These guys don't kid around.

48:24.793 --> 48:29.929
Nile crocodiles have long
powerful tails and webbed feet

48:29.931 --> 48:32.632
that make them
excellent swimmers.

48:32.634 --> 48:35.268
And they have
very powerful jaws

48:35.270 --> 48:37.770
for catching prey
and tearing off flesh.

48:37.772 --> 48:40.574
Let's go check out
more nile crocodiles.

48:40.576 --> 48:43.409
Look at that one.
How amazing is that?

48:43.411 --> 48:47.614
Hey, cup-k, do nile
crocodiles chew their food?

48:47.616 --> 48:51.250
All species of crocodiles
don't chew their food.

48:51.252 --> 48:53.887
They produce tears
when they swallow.

48:53.889 --> 48:59.259
This is because
they swallow too much air!

48:59.261 --> 49:01.895
Which combines
with the lacrimal glands...

49:01.897 --> 49:03.896
glands that produce tears,

49:03.898 --> 49:06.500
and forces tears to flow.

49:06.502 --> 49:09.670
I guess nobody ever taught
them table manners.

49:09.672 --> 49:11.737
Hey, i think
we just found the answer

49:11.739 --> 49:14.407
to captain maya's
mission question.

49:14.409 --> 49:15.909
Awesome!

49:15.911 --> 49:18.545
Space explorers, go!

49:18.547 --> 49:22.782
Space explorers, go!

49:22.784 --> 49:24.617
Fantastic work, guys.

49:24.619 --> 49:27.554
- Your mission was a super success.
- Yes!

49:27.556 --> 49:30.489
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

49:30.491 --> 49:32.925
Yes, captain maya,
we sure did.

49:32.927 --> 49:35.262
All crocodiles cry.

49:35.264 --> 49:37.931
That's because they swallow
too much air with their food,

49:37.933 --> 49:40.300
which combines
with the lacrimal glands

49:40.302 --> 49:41.934
and forces tears to flow.

49:41.936 --> 49:44.538
That's good information to know,
space explorers.

49:44.540 --> 49:46.440
You did it! Awesome job.

49:46.442 --> 49:47.974
Thank you, captain maya.

49:47.976 --> 49:49.710
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

49:49.712 --> 49:52.645
This is sure to be
your most dreamy mission yet,

49:52.647 --> 49:53.880
young space explorers.

49:53.882 --> 49:58.751
Dreamy?
I love dreamy missions.

49:58.753 --> 50:01.822
I'm always up
for a dreamy mission.

50:01.824 --> 50:03.422
Well, i'm excited to report

50:03.424 --> 50:05.558
you two will be heading
to earth's troposphere.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.759
Troposphere?

50:06.761 --> 50:08.862
What... what's troposphere?

50:08.864 --> 50:10.463
It's a layer of atmosphere

50:10.465 --> 50:12.833
in which nearly
all earth's weather occurs,

50:12.835 --> 50:15.668
extending some six miles
above the ground.

50:15.670 --> 50:17.003
We want you to identify

50:17.005 --> 50:18.904
and learn
all about stratus clouds.

50:18.906 --> 50:22.742
Stratus clouds?
Sounds fantastic.

50:22.744 --> 50:25.712
This is going to be
our most amazing mission yet.

50:25.714 --> 50:28.681
What can you tell us about
stratus clouds, captain maya?

50:28.683 --> 50:31.684
I can tell you that stratus
clouds are of two kinds...

50:31.686 --> 50:33.820
nebulosus or fractus.

50:33.822 --> 50:35.521
They exist in lower altitudes,

50:35.523 --> 50:39.860
generally reaching an altitude
of only 6,500 feet.

50:39.862 --> 50:43.362
Wow, i can't wait to check
those stratus clouds out.

50:43.364 --> 50:46.532
They sound
absolutely fascinating.

50:46.534 --> 50:49.703
They are. Stratus clouds
are typically seen

50:49.705 --> 50:51.871
either near the coast
or around mountains.

50:51.873 --> 50:55.007
Stratus clouds don't typically
produce much, if any, rain.

50:55.009 --> 50:56.710
And check this out,

50:56.712 --> 50:58.411
if a stratus cloud
is separated by wind gusts,

50:58.413 --> 51:00.813
the cloud has turned
stratus fractus.

51:00.815 --> 51:03.016
Stratus fractus?

51:03.018 --> 51:05.585
Whoa, that's a big word,
captain maya.

51:05.587 --> 51:09.021
Nick and sammy, i want you
to learn as much as possible

51:09.023 --> 51:10.924
about stratus clouds
during your mission.

51:10.926 --> 51:13.326
- Yes, ma'am.
- We will!

51:13.328 --> 51:15.027
But above all,
there's a question

51:15.029 --> 51:17.029
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

51:17.031 --> 51:19.733
have not been able to answer
about stratus clouds.

51:19.735 --> 51:21.735
We need you
two space explorers

51:21.737 --> 51:23.570
to help us answer
the mission question

51:23.572 --> 51:26.473
- about stratus clouds.
- What's the question?

51:26.475 --> 51:29.375
Are stratus clouds
flat or puffy?

51:29.377 --> 51:32.712
That's a very good question,
captain maya.

51:32.714 --> 51:35.114
We'll find the answer.
You'll see.

51:35.116 --> 51:37.416
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

51:37.418 --> 51:39.418
will transport you a million
light years to earth

51:39.420 --> 51:40.954
at the drop of a hat.

51:40.956 --> 51:42.922
And your trusty
helper robot cup-k

51:42.924 --> 51:44.757
will assist you
on your mission.

51:44.759 --> 51:47.594
- Off you go.
- Space explorers, go!

51:47.596 --> 51:49.965
Space explorers, go!

52:00.509 --> 52:03.777
We are about to reach our
destination, space explorers...

52:03.779 --> 52:07.848
- earth.
- Wow, look at it! Beautiful.

52:07.850 --> 52:11.985
The most beautiful place
in all the universe.

52:11.987 --> 52:15.124
I love coming to earth!

52:24.900 --> 52:26.565
Where are we headed, sky a?

52:26.567 --> 52:28.969
First stop, earth's sky.

52:28.971 --> 52:32.572
That's where we will find
many stratus clouds.

52:32.574 --> 52:35.842
- Earth's sky.
- Sounds so cool.

52:35.844 --> 52:37.677
Hello, space explorers.

52:37.679 --> 52:39.612
I see you'll be heading
to earth's sky.

52:39.614 --> 52:40.880
How exciting.

52:40.882 --> 52:42.516
Cup-k, sky a,

52:42.518 --> 52:44.583
please fill
the space explorers in

52:44.585 --> 52:46.453
on some amazing facts
about the sky.

52:46.455 --> 52:48.487
Sure, captain maya.

52:48.489 --> 52:52.491
Nick, sammy,
did you know that the energy

52:52.493 --> 52:56.563
produced from the sun
is so strong

52:56.565 --> 52:59.666
that every second,
its core releases

52:59.668 --> 53:05.438
the equivalent of 100 billion
nuclear bombs?

53:05.440 --> 53:07.507
That's pretty mind-blowing.

53:07.509 --> 53:09.009
Check those clouds out.

53:09.011 --> 53:11.143
I would've never imagined that.

53:11.145 --> 53:15.681
Another interesting
fact about the earth's sky

53:15.683 --> 53:18.150
is that astronomers
discovered a star

53:18.152 --> 53:23.857
made entirely
of diamonds in 2004

53:23.859 --> 53:29.029
which is more than
2,400 miles across

53:29.031 --> 53:34.668
and is made up of 10 billion,
trillion, trillion carats.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.237
What? That's incredible.

53:37.239 --> 53:39.873
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

53:39.875 --> 53:42.041
We are approaching
earth's troposphere.

53:42.043 --> 53:45.878
Who o... hoo!

53:45.880 --> 53:48.815
Who o-hoo!

53:48.817 --> 53:50.884
We've entered
earth's troposphere.

53:50.886 --> 53:53.820
Approaching the sky
above the california coast.

53:53.822 --> 53:56.857
- Pretty!
- Cool space gases!

53:56.859 --> 54:00.025
- There it is.
- The california coast.

54:00.027 --> 54:04.563
The california coast
is an incredible place.

54:04.565 --> 54:08.634
A lot of amazing weather
phenomena happens there!

54:08.636 --> 54:10.637
Can't wait to get
learning about them.

54:10.639 --> 54:12.572
Fog is a common
weather phenomenon

54:12.574 --> 54:15.608
along the san francisco bay area
in california.

54:15.610 --> 54:18.578
You should also find plenty
of stratus clouds to observe.

54:18.580 --> 54:20.145
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

54:20.147 --> 54:21.882
We'll be waiting
for your report.

54:21.884 --> 54:25.951
See you soon, captain maya.
Let's get flying, sky a.

54:25.953 --> 54:28.221
Speaking of flying,

54:28.223 --> 54:32.025
did you guys know
that california flying fish,

54:32.027 --> 54:34.927
cypselurus californicus,

54:34.929 --> 54:37.096
often spotted by boaters

54:37.098 --> 54:40.933
heading to and from
santa catalina island,

54:40.935 --> 54:42.768
can glide in the air

54:42.770 --> 54:46.773
for distances
up to 20 yards?

54:46.775 --> 54:50.610
To stay aloft,
the 15-inch fish

54:50.612 --> 54:55.148
uses its pectoral
and pelvic fins as wings.

54:55.150 --> 54:58.250
Whoa, a flying fish!

54:58.252 --> 55:02.956
Hey, look over there.
What beautiful clouds.

55:02.958 --> 55:04.657
They must be stratus.

55:04.659 --> 55:06.159
Why are they called stratus,
cup-k?

55:06.161 --> 55:10.963
The word "stratus"
means blanket or a layer.

55:10.965 --> 55:13.967
The stratus clouds
are called so

55:13.969 --> 55:19.139
because they are spread
across the sky

55:19.141 --> 55:21.308
in a thin layer.

55:21.310 --> 55:23.242
Wow!

55:23.244 --> 55:26.579
Hey, guys, look over there.
What's that?

55:26.581 --> 55:28.949
That's a stratocumulus.

55:28.951 --> 55:32.085
A stratocumulus?

55:32.087 --> 55:33.987
That's correct.

55:33.989 --> 55:37.157
Stratocumulus clouds
are developed vertically,

55:37.159 --> 55:40.159
and hence,
appear as rows of cotton balls

55:40.161 --> 55:42.895
when viewed from below.

55:42.897 --> 55:46.299
Due to its vertical arrangement
of stratocumulus,

55:46.301 --> 55:50.003
the top end
might sometimes cool down

55:50.005 --> 55:53.172
during the winter
and cause rain.

55:53.174 --> 55:56.942
Otherwise, they rarely cause
any perspiration.

55:56.944 --> 55:58.978
Incredible!

55:58.980 --> 56:01.246
What other cloud forms
can be found in california?

56:01.248 --> 56:03.148
Approaching cirrostratus.

56:03.150 --> 56:04.650
Cirrostratus?

56:04.652 --> 56:08.020
Cirrostratus is sheet-like
thin clouds

56:08.022 --> 56:11.724
that usually cover
the entire sky.

56:11.726 --> 56:16.695
The sun or moon can shine
through cirrostratus clouds.

56:16.697 --> 56:18.864
Sometimes the sun or moon

56:18.866 --> 56:21.867
will appear to have
a halo around it

56:21.869 --> 56:25.137
when in the presence
of cirrostratus.

56:25.139 --> 56:28.208
Dreamy.
Hey, look over there.

56:28.210 --> 56:30.175
I think i see a cirrostratus.

56:30.177 --> 56:32.344
Let's take
a closer look, sky a.

56:32.346 --> 56:35.047
- Approaching.
- Cool space gases!

56:35.049 --> 56:39.219
- This is so exciting.
- Explorers, go!

56:39.221 --> 56:43.223
Cup-k, what else can you
tell us about cirrostratus?

56:43.225 --> 56:46.025
Cirrostratus
clouds usually come

56:46.027 --> 56:49.996
12 to 24 hours
before a rain or snowstorm,

56:49.998 --> 56:54.433
especially if middle group
clouds are associated with it.

56:54.435 --> 56:56.136
Look! Over there!

56:56.138 --> 56:57.904
Do cirrostratus clouds

56:57.906 --> 57:01.107
mean a storm is coming,
like cumulus clouds?

57:01.109 --> 57:02.741
No, they don't.

57:02.743 --> 57:05.145
Cirrostratus clouds
means rain

57:05.147 --> 57:06.378
or snow is coming,

57:06.380 --> 57:08.815
unlike cumulus clouds,

57:08.817 --> 57:12.384
which means a storm
or thunderstorm is coming.

57:12.386 --> 57:15.054
Oh! Very interesting.

57:15.056 --> 57:17.824
Cirrostratus clouds
are usually made up

57:17.826 --> 57:19.458
of tiny ice crystals.

57:19.460 --> 57:22.262
And because of this,
sometimes at night

57:22.264 --> 57:25.364
they can also make a halo
around the moon.

57:25.366 --> 57:27.233
That's pretty amazing.

57:27.235 --> 57:31.471
Cirrostratus is a thin,
sheet-like layer of cloud

57:31.473 --> 57:35.275
which is 18,000 feet
above the ground.

57:35.277 --> 57:37.177
Whoa, pretty.

57:37.179 --> 57:40.145
Let's go check out more
cirrostratus clouds.

57:40.147 --> 57:41.313
Look at that one.

57:41.315 --> 57:43.416
It's just amazing.

57:43.418 --> 57:45.117
Hey, cup-k,

57:45.119 --> 57:47.786
are cirrostratus clouds
as big and puffy

57:47.788 --> 57:49.288
as cumulus clouds?

57:49.290 --> 57:51.056
Cirrostratus clouds

57:51.058 --> 57:54.960
are thin, wispy,
stringy clouds

57:54.962 --> 57:56.962
way up high in the sky.

57:56.964 --> 58:01.934
And just like stratus clouds,
they are flat and hazy.

58:01.936 --> 58:04.337
- Oh, i see.
- Hey, nick,

58:04.339 --> 58:07.107
i think we might've
just found the answer

58:07.109 --> 58:09.141
to captain maya's
mission question.

58:09.143 --> 58:11.210
We did? Yay!

58:11.212 --> 58:13.947
Space explorers, go!

58:13.949 --> 58:17.784
Space explorers, go!

58:17.786 --> 58:18.985
Great job, kids,

58:18.987 --> 58:20.820
your mission
was a great success.

58:20.822 --> 58:23.155
- Awesome!
- And did you find out

58:23.157 --> 58:24.290
the answer to
your mission question?

58:24.292 --> 58:26.391
Yes, captain maya, we did.

58:26.393 --> 58:30.829
Stratus clouds are flat,
just like cirrostratus clouds,

58:30.831 --> 58:33.299
and not puffy
like stratocumulus clouds.

58:33.301 --> 58:36.235
That's incredible, team.
You did it. Good work.

58:36.237 --> 58:38.036
Thank you, captain maya.

58:38.038 --> 58:40.005
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

58:40.007 --> 58:42.474
This is sure to be your
most interesting mission yet,

58:42.476 --> 58:44.110
young space explorers.

58:44.112 --> 58:47.012
Cool space gases!
I can't wait.

58:47.014 --> 58:49.415
I'm always up for
an interesting mission, too.

58:49.417 --> 58:51.183
Well, i'm excited to report

58:51.185 --> 58:53.219
you two will be heading
back to earth.

58:53.221 --> 58:54.920
Yes! Love it!

58:54.922 --> 58:56.889
We absolutely love
going to earth.

58:56.891 --> 59:00.559
Yes, this time we want you
to learn all about penguins.

59:00.561 --> 59:03.395
Penguins?
They're super cute.

59:03.397 --> 59:07.132
This is going to be our most
adorable mission ever.

59:07.134 --> 59:09.936
What can you tell us
about penguins, captain maya?

59:09.938 --> 59:11.503
I can tell you
that most penguins

59:11.505 --> 59:13.139
live in
the southern hemisphere.

59:13.141 --> 59:15.375
Fossils place the earliest
penguin relative

59:15.377 --> 59:17.576
at some 60 million years ago,

59:17.578 --> 59:20.480
meaning an ancestor
of the birds we see today

59:20.482 --> 59:23.016
survived the mass extinction
of the dinosaurs.

59:23.018 --> 59:25.083
What? I can't wait
to check them out.

59:25.085 --> 59:28.387
Penguins sound
totally fascinating.

59:28.389 --> 59:30.824
They are.
Penguins are flightless birds.

59:30.826 --> 59:33.058
While other birds
have wings for flying,

59:33.060 --> 59:34.893
penguins have adapted flippers

59:34.895 --> 59:36.262
to help them
swim in the water.

59:36.264 --> 59:39.065
Birds with flippers
instead of wings?

59:39.067 --> 59:40.599
That's incredible,
captain maya.

59:40.601 --> 59:42.235
As you know, nick and sammy,

59:42.237 --> 59:44.404
every time we send
our space explorers

59:44.406 --> 59:46.206
to observe
a new earth species,

59:46.208 --> 59:48.974
we ask them to collect
as many facts as possible.

59:48.976 --> 59:51.009
- Yes, captain maya.
- We will.

59:51.011 --> 59:53.246
But above all,
there's a question

59:53.248 --> 59:55.081
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

59:55.083 --> 59:57.550
have not been able
to answer about penguins.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.552
We need
you two space explorers

59:59.554 --> 01:00:01.253
to help us answer
the mission question

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:03.288
about this
fascinating species.

01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:06.291
- What's the question?
- Can penguins fly?

01:00:06.293 --> 01:00:09.329
That's a great question,
captain maya.

01:00:09.331 --> 01:00:12.030
We'll find the answer.
I have no doubt.

01:00:12.032 --> 01:00:14.333
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

01:00:14.335 --> 01:00:16.335
will transport you a million
light years to earth

01:00:16.337 --> 01:00:17.570
in leaps and bounds.

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:20.139
And your trusty helper robot
cup-k

01:00:20.141 --> 01:00:22.175
will assist you on your mission.
Off you go.

01:00:22.177 --> 01:00:24.309
Space explorers, go!

01:00:24.311 --> 01:00:28.217
Space explorers, go!

01:00:38.025 --> 01:00:41.194
We are about to reach our
destination, space explorers...

01:00:41.196 --> 01:00:44.063
- planet earth.
- Wow, look at it.

01:00:44.065 --> 01:00:47.567
The most beautiful
place ever.

01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:49.469
I love earth, too.

01:00:49.471 --> 01:00:51.103
Where are we headed, sky a.

01:00:51.105 --> 01:00:52.371
First stop, new zeal and.

01:00:52.373 --> 01:00:53.940
That's where we will find

01:00:53.942 --> 01:00:56.541
many fascinating species
of penguins.

01:00:56.543 --> 01:00:59.445
New zeal and? Yes!

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:02.415
Great! I always wanted
to check out new zeal and.

01:01:02.417 --> 01:01:06.219
Hello, space explorers, i see
you'll be heading to new zeal and.

01:01:06.221 --> 01:01:07.387
How exciting.

01:01:07.389 --> 01:01:08.621
Cup-k, sky a,

01:01:08.623 --> 01:01:10.188
please fill
the space explorers in

01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.391
on some amazing facts
about new zeal and.

01:01:12.393 --> 01:01:15.594
Sure, captain maya.
Nick, sammy,

01:01:15.596 --> 01:01:18.697
did you know
that hector's dolphin

01:01:18.699 --> 01:01:22.067
is the smallest dolphin
in the world,

01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:24.137
and it is found
only in the waters

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.672
around new zeal and.

01:01:25.674 --> 01:01:29.942
Adult dolphins average
about 4 1/2 feet in length,

01:01:29.944 --> 01:01:32.311
smaller
than most adult humans.

01:01:32.313 --> 01:01:35.148
Cute.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.050
New zeal and is also home

01:01:37.052 --> 01:01:40.219
to the world's only
flightless parrot, the kakapo.

01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:42.020
A flightless parrot?

01:01:42.022 --> 01:01:43.422
I never knew they existed.

01:01:43.424 --> 01:01:47.059
Another interesting fact

01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:48.661
about new zeal and

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:52.699
is that there are no snakes
in the country.

01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:54.534
What? Amazing.

01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:55.668
Space explorers,

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.270
prepare for entry.

01:01:57.272 --> 01:01:58.737
We are approaching
earth's stratosphere.

01:01:58.739 --> 01:02:00.405
Who o-hoo!

01:02:00.407 --> 01:02:04.177
Who o... hoo!

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.311
We've entered

01:02:05.313 --> 01:02:06.612
earth's stratosphere.

01:02:06.614 --> 01:02:07.713
Approaching new zeal and,

01:02:07.715 --> 01:02:09.614
stew art island,
to be precise.

01:02:09.616 --> 01:02:12.451
- Awesome!
- Cool!

01:02:12.453 --> 01:02:14.219
There it is.

01:02:14.221 --> 01:02:15.654
Stew art island.

01:02:15.656 --> 01:02:19.992
Stew art island is a very
fascinating place.

01:02:19.994 --> 01:02:24.364
A lot of pretty incredible
animal species live there.

01:02:24.366 --> 01:02:26.465
Can't wait to get started
on our mission.

01:02:26.467 --> 01:02:29.634
Stew art island is new zealand's
third largest island.

01:02:29.636 --> 01:02:32.672
It's also home to at least three
species of penguins

01:02:32.674 --> 01:02:35.541
and more than 20,000
kiwi birds.

01:02:35.543 --> 01:02:38.076
You should find plenty
of penguins to observe.

01:02:38.078 --> 01:02:40.012
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

01:02:40.014 --> 01:02:41.748
We'll be waiting
for your report.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.616
See you soon, captain maya.

01:02:43.618 --> 01:02:47.320
Stew art island is a
haven for the blue penguin,

01:02:47.322 --> 01:02:49.755
the rare yellow-eyed penguin,

01:02:49.757 --> 01:02:52.692
and the fiordland
crested penguins,

01:02:52.694 --> 01:02:54.793
which waddle
among the rocks.

01:02:54.795 --> 01:02:57.429
How cool. Hey, cup-k,

01:02:57.431 --> 01:02:59.232
do penguins eat plants?

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.567
Penguins don't eat plants.

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.770
They are carnivores,

01:03:04.772 --> 01:03:07.739
and feed primarily
on sea organisms,

01:03:07.741 --> 01:03:11.476
like fish, krill, and squid.

01:03:11.478 --> 01:03:13.545
Interesting.

01:03:13.547 --> 01:03:16.114
Hey, guys, look over there.

01:03:16.116 --> 01:03:17.416
What's that animal?

01:03:17.418 --> 01:03:19.284
That's a blue penguin.

01:03:19.286 --> 01:03:21.387
A blue penguin?

01:03:21.389 --> 01:03:22.454
That's correct.

01:03:22.456 --> 01:03:24.223
That little blue penguin

01:03:24.225 --> 01:03:27.192
is also called
a ferry penguin

01:03:27.194 --> 01:03:30.797
and measures
less than 13 inches tall

01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:34.599
and about three pounds
in weight as adults.

01:03:34.601 --> 01:03:39.371
They are in fact the smallest
species of penguin.

01:03:39.373 --> 01:03:41.808
Blue penguins have blue heads

01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:43.442
and gray beaks.

01:03:43.444 --> 01:03:47.112
They are also blue backs
with white bellies.

01:03:47.114 --> 01:03:49.549
Cute overload.

01:03:49.551 --> 01:03:51.416
What other penguins
live in new zeal and.

01:03:51.418 --> 01:03:53.386
Approaching
yellow-eyed penguins.

01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:56.422
Yellow-eyed penguins?

01:03:56.424 --> 01:03:58.458
They are
the fourth largest penguin

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:02.161
and grow as high
as two feet tall.

01:04:02.163 --> 01:04:03.362
Look over there.

01:04:03.364 --> 01:04:05.465
I think i see a yellow-eyed
penguin.

01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.366
Let's take a closer look,
sky a.

01:04:07.368 --> 01:04:09.835
- Approaching.
- Cool space gases!

01:04:09.837 --> 01:04:11.471
This is so exciting.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.873
Explorers go!

01:04:13.875 --> 01:04:18.110
Cup-k, what else can you tell us
about yellow-eyed penguins?

01:04:18.112 --> 01:04:22.782
They feed almost exclusively
on fish and some squid,

01:04:22.784 --> 01:04:26.219
swimming near the bottom
of the ocean

01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:28.654
to catch blue cod, red cod,

01:04:28.656 --> 01:04:31.491
sprat, and opal fish.

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:35.527
They swim up to 15 miles
offshore to find food

01:04:35.529 --> 01:04:38.598
and are excellent divers.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.333
Look over there.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:42.501
What beautiful feathers.

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:44.170
Were they born this way?

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:45.837
Yellow-eyed penguins

01:04:45.839 --> 01:04:48.741
have very beautiful feathers,

01:04:48.743 --> 01:04:51.677
and at the end of each
breeding season,

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:55.348
the adults molt
and regrow their feathers

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:57.483
all at once.

01:04:57.485 --> 01:05:00.353
They're gorgeous.

01:05:00.355 --> 01:05:01.621
The yellow-eyed penguin

01:05:01.623 --> 01:05:04.257
is so reclusive
that breeding couples

01:05:04.259 --> 01:05:06.592
must mate
in complete isolation,

01:05:06.594 --> 01:05:08.927
out of the view
of other penguins.

01:05:08.929 --> 01:05:10.829
Oh, that's pretty cool.

01:05:10.831 --> 01:05:12.697
The average lifespan

01:05:12.699 --> 01:05:14.199
of a yellow-eyed penguin

01:05:14.201 --> 01:05:15.934
is 23 years.

01:05:15.936 --> 01:05:18.670
Males are believed to live
longer than females.

01:05:18.672 --> 01:05:20.338
Incredible!

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.275
Let's go check out
more yellow-eyed penguins.

01:05:23.277 --> 01:05:24.442
Look at that one.

01:05:24.444 --> 01:05:26.179
That's just amazing.

01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:27.413
Hey, cup-k,

01:05:27.415 --> 01:05:29.447
do yellow-eyed penguins
have wings?

01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:31.784
Penguins don't have wings.

01:05:31.786 --> 01:05:34.487
They can't fly.

01:05:34.489 --> 01:05:35.855
But they have flippers,

01:05:35.857 --> 01:05:37.822
which look like wings

01:05:37.824 --> 01:05:42.228
and are tapered
and flattened for swimming.

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.697
Whoa!
A bird that can't fly?

01:05:44.699 --> 01:05:47.300
Hey, i think we might've
just answered

01:05:47.302 --> 01:05:48.934
captain maya's
mission question.

01:05:48.936 --> 01:05:50.203
We did?

01:05:50.205 --> 01:05:52.672
Space explorers, go!

01:05:52.674 --> 01:05:56.608
Space explorers, go!

01:05:56.610 --> 01:05:57.876
Good job, gang.

01:05:57.878 --> 01:05:59.679
Your mission
was a great success.

01:05:59.681 --> 01:06:01.480
Yippy!

01:06:01.482 --> 01:06:03.916
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:06.451
You bet, captain maya!
Tell her, sammy.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.654
Penguins can't fly.

01:06:08.656 --> 01:06:10.822
They don't have wings,
but flippers,

01:06:10.824 --> 01:06:13.525
which are tapered
for swimming, not flying.

01:06:13.527 --> 01:06:15.695
That's good, team.
You did it. Great job.

01:06:15.697 --> 01:06:17.563
Thank you, captain maya.

01:06:17.565 --> 01:06:19.431
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

01:06:19.433 --> 01:06:22.235
This is sure to be your
most adventurous mission yet,

01:06:22.237 --> 01:06:23.536
young space explorers.

01:06:23.538 --> 01:06:25.438
Cool space gases!

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.739
I love adventurous missions.

01:06:27.741 --> 01:06:30.275
I'm always up
for an adventure, too.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.411
Well, i'm excited
to let you know

01:06:32.413 --> 01:06:34.447
you two will be heading
back to earth.

01:06:34.449 --> 01:06:37.282
I knew it. We're so lucky.

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:39.384
We love earth, captain maya.

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:41.520
We want you to learn
all about rock formation.

01:06:41.522 --> 01:06:42.954
Rock formations?

01:06:42.956 --> 01:06:44.924
So exciting.

01:06:44.926 --> 01:06:48.460
This is going to be
our most amazing mission yet.

01:06:48.462 --> 01:06:49.762
What can you tell us

01:06:49.764 --> 01:06:51.931
about rock formations,
captain maya?

01:06:51.933 --> 01:06:53.833
I can tell you
that the earth's crust

01:06:53.835 --> 01:06:55.701
is made up of rock
and that rocks

01:06:55.703 --> 01:06:56.936
are naturally occurring solids

01:06:56.938 --> 01:06:58.536
made up of mineral.

01:06:58.538 --> 01:07:02.041
Wow. I can't wait to check
these rocks out.

01:07:02.043 --> 01:07:06.612
Yep, rock formations sound
absolutely fascinating.

01:07:06.614 --> 01:07:08.614
They are. Rock formations

01:07:08.616 --> 01:07:09.982
are generally not uniform

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:11.750
or made up of exact structures

01:07:11.752 --> 01:07:14.320
that can be described
by scientific formulas.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:17.456
They are generally classified
by how they were made or formed.

01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:18.991
There are three major types
of rocks...

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:22.460
metamorphic, igneous,
and sedimentary.

01:07:22.462 --> 01:07:26.898
Whoa. Those are some big
words, captain maya.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:28.634
Nick and sammy, you know that

01:07:28.636 --> 01:07:31.337
every time we send
our space explorers to earth,

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:33.905
we ask them to collect
as much data as possible.

01:07:33.907 --> 01:07:35.675
Yes, ma'am, we will.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:37.076
You bet!

01:07:37.078 --> 01:07:39.045
But above all,
there's a question

01:07:39.047 --> 01:07:41.012
that all the brightest minds
of the galaxy

01:07:41.014 --> 01:07:43.748
have not been able
to answer about rock formation.

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:45.784
We need
you two space explorers

01:07:45.786 --> 01:07:47.686
to help us answer
the mission question

01:07:47.688 --> 01:07:49.054
about rock formations.

01:07:49.056 --> 01:07:50.855
What's that, captain maya?

01:07:50.857 --> 01:07:52.657
Do all canyons have rivers?

01:07:52.659 --> 01:07:55.695
That's a fascinating question,
captain maya.

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.929
Your state-of-the-art
space pod sky a

01:07:57.931 --> 01:08:00.366
will transport you a million
light years to earth

01:08:00.368 --> 01:08:01.634
at one fell swoop.

01:08:01.636 --> 01:08:04.103
And your trusty helper robot
cup-k

01:08:04.105 --> 01:08:05.737
will assist you on your mission.

01:08:05.739 --> 01:08:07.005
Off you go.

01:08:07.007 --> 01:08:08.607
Space explorers, go!

01:08:08.609 --> 01:08:11.846
Space explorers, go!

01:08:21.955 --> 01:08:23.354
We are about to reach

01:08:23.357 --> 01:08:25.890
our destination,
space explorers... earth.

01:08:25.892 --> 01:08:28.359
Yes, amazing place.

01:08:28.362 --> 01:08:30.828
The most beautiful
place ever.

01:08:30.831 --> 01:08:33.567
I love earth!

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:45.010
Where are we headed, sky a?

01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:47.747
First stop,
united states of america.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.148
That's where we will find

01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:52.417
many fascinating kinds
of rock formations.

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:54.819
United states?

01:08:54.821 --> 01:08:57.590
I always wanted to visit
the united states.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.457
Hello, space explorers.

01:08:59.459 --> 01:09:02.060
I see you'll be heading to
the united states of america,

01:09:02.062 --> 01:09:03.429
an amazing place.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:04.662
Cup-k, sky a,

01:09:04.663 --> 01:09:06.497
please fill
the space explorers in

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:07.698
on some amazing facts

01:09:07.701 --> 01:09:09.533
about united states
of america.

01:09:09.536 --> 01:09:11.537
You got it, captain maya.

01:09:11.538 --> 01:09:13.104
Nick, sammy,

01:09:13.106 --> 01:09:16.707
did you know that the tallest
mountain in the world,

01:09:16.710 --> 01:09:17.841
mauna k ea,

01:09:17.844 --> 01:09:20.179
is located in hawaii?

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.848
When measured
from the sea floor,

01:09:22.850 --> 01:09:27.586
it is over 32,000 feet high,

01:09:27.587 --> 01:09:29.121
while mount everest

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:32.689
is 29,028 feet high.

01:09:32.692 --> 01:09:34.894
That's amazing.

01:09:34.895 --> 01:09:37.828
It has to be a huge mountain.

01:09:37.831 --> 01:09:40.032
A bit of trivia for you guys...

01:09:40.033 --> 01:09:42.966
chic ago,
a city in the united states,

01:09:42.969 --> 01:09:46.439
is the birthplace
of first ever ferris wheel,

01:09:46.441 --> 01:09:49.475
which was 264 feet tall

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:53.845
and debuted
in the 1893 world's fair.

01:09:53.846 --> 01:09:55.613
That sounds like fun.

01:09:55.615 --> 01:09:58.583
Another interesting fact

01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.519
about the united states

01:10:00.521 --> 01:10:06.524
is that three of the world's
five oldest rivers flows here.

01:10:06.526 --> 01:10:11.463
The new, the susquehanna,
and the french broad rivers

01:10:11.465 --> 01:10:16.001
are each hundreds
of millions of years old.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:17.635
No way.

01:10:17.637 --> 01:10:20.573
Space explorers,
prepare for entry.

01:10:20.575 --> 01:10:22.707
We are approaching
earth's exosphere.

01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:28.713
- Who o... hoo!
- Who o-hoo!

01:10:28.715 --> 01:10:30.683
We've entered
earth's stratosphere.

01:10:30.685 --> 01:10:33.185
Approaching
united states of america,

01:10:33.187 --> 01:10:34.854
nevada, to be precise.

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:36.488
Yeah!

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:38.957
Cool space meteorites!
There it is.

01:10:38.959 --> 01:10:42.760
Nevada. So beautiful.

01:10:42.762 --> 01:10:47.765
Nevada is an incredible place
to visit.

01:10:47.767 --> 01:10:50.034
Can't wait to get started
on our mission.

01:10:50.036 --> 01:10:53.506
Nevada's the seventh largest
state in the united states.

01:10:53.508 --> 01:10:55.174
About 85 % of its land

01:10:55.176 --> 01:10:56.908
is owned
by the federal government.

01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.944
You should find plenty of rock
formations to observe.

01:10:59.946 --> 01:11:01.881
Enjoy your mission,
space explorers.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.282
We'll be waiting
for your report.

01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:05.917
See you later, captain maya.

01:11:05.919 --> 01:11:08.554
Hey, guys, did you know

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.922
that the red rock canyon
was designated

01:11:10.924 --> 01:11:14.926
as nevada's first national
conservation area?

01:11:14.928 --> 01:11:18.162
It is located 17 miles west

01:11:18.164 --> 01:11:20.299
of the city of las veg as.

01:11:20.301 --> 01:11:22.568
Interesting.

01:11:22.570 --> 01:11:24.702
Are there waterfalls
in red rock canyon?

01:11:24.704 --> 01:11:27.739
There are waterfalls
at red rock canyon.

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:29.675
Most of them are seasonal.

01:11:29.677 --> 01:11:31.109
Amazing.

01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:33.244
Hey, guys, look over there.
What's that?

01:11:33.246 --> 01:11:35.680
That's red rock canyon.

01:11:35.682 --> 01:11:39.717
Yep, the great sandstone cliffs
at red rock

01:11:39.719 --> 01:11:41.886
are thousands of feet high.

01:11:41.888 --> 01:11:45.291
They are made up
of aztec sandstone.

01:11:45.293 --> 01:11:46.891
These formations

01:11:46.893 --> 01:11:51.564
are about
190 million years old.

01:11:51.566 --> 01:11:53.866
The red color
of some of the outcrops

01:11:53.868 --> 01:11:55.634
of the aztec sandstone

01:11:55.636 --> 01:11:58.970
is due to the presence
of iron oxide

01:11:58.972 --> 01:12:02.107
or hematite
in its composition.

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.777
Totally beautiful.

01:12:04.779 --> 01:12:07.046
What other canyons are there
in the united states?

01:12:07.048 --> 01:12:08.881
Approaching grand canyon.

01:12:08.883 --> 01:12:12.117
Grand canyon.
Can't wait.

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:14.086
The grand canyon

01:12:14.088 --> 01:12:17.288
is located
in the state of arizona.

01:12:17.290 --> 01:12:21.092
It's 277 miles in length

01:12:21.094 --> 01:12:25.965
and 18 miles across
at its widest points.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.666
Can you believe it?

01:12:27.668 --> 01:12:32.671
The grand canyon
is around 6,000 feet deep.

01:12:32.673 --> 01:12:34.739
No wonder it's called grand.

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:36.007
Look! Look over there!

01:12:36.009 --> 01:12:38.077
I think i see the grand canyon.

01:12:38.079 --> 01:12:41.880
Whoa. Incredible.

01:12:41.882 --> 01:12:44.617
Let's take a closer peek, sky a.

01:12:44.619 --> 01:12:45.717
Approaching.

01:12:45.719 --> 01:12:47.385
Cool space gases!

01:12:47.387 --> 01:12:49.220
This is so cool.

01:12:49.222 --> 01:12:51.189
Space explorers, go!

01:12:51.191 --> 01:12:54.059
Space explorers, go!

01:12:54.061 --> 01:12:57.229
The rock found at the bottom
of the grand canyon

01:12:57.231 --> 01:12:58.796
is called schist

01:12:58.798 --> 01:13:02.635
and is around
two billion years old,

01:13:02.637 --> 01:13:05.371
while the rock
found in the upper rim,

01:13:05.373 --> 01:13:06.939
called limestone,

01:13:06.941 --> 01:13:10.643
is about 230 million years old.

01:13:10.645 --> 01:13:14.046
Look over there!
Incredible views.

01:13:14.048 --> 01:13:16.081
Can i hike in the grand canyon?

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:18.384
Yes, you can.

01:13:18.386 --> 01:13:20.284
There are numerous
hiking trails

01:13:20.286 --> 01:13:22.186
across the entire canyon

01:13:22.188 --> 01:13:24.989
that amateurs and veterans
can hike.

01:13:24.991 --> 01:13:26.291
I knew it!

01:13:26.293 --> 01:13:27.792
The grand canyon

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:29.862
is one of the world's
natural wonders

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:32.363
and sees millions
of visitors

01:13:32.365 --> 01:13:34.399
on its cliffs every year.

01:13:34.401 --> 01:13:37.202
Wow, what an amazing place.

01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:40.372
But it can also be dangerous.

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:43.809
Snakes abound
in the grand canyon.

01:13:43.811 --> 01:13:46.077
And while most of them
are harmless,

01:13:46.079 --> 01:13:49.081
some of them,
like the rattlesnake,

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:51.116
are venomous.

01:13:51.118 --> 01:13:55.421
So hikers must always
watch their step.

01:13:55.423 --> 01:13:58.791
Did you know that
of the six rattlesnake species

01:13:58.793 --> 01:14:00.192
that live in the park,

01:14:00.194 --> 01:14:04.128
one has an unusual pink hue

01:14:04.130 --> 01:14:06.698
that matches the local rocks.

01:14:06.700 --> 01:14:08.966
To blend in. Very smart.

01:14:08.968 --> 01:14:11.269
Let's go check out
more canyons.

01:14:11.271 --> 01:14:12.403
Look over at that.

01:14:12.405 --> 01:14:14.206
That's just amazing.

01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:17.309
Hey, cup-k, can i
fish in the grand canyon?

01:14:17.311 --> 01:14:20.378
Yes, you can fish
in the grand canyon,

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.049
just like
as in every other canyon

01:14:24.051 --> 01:14:27.152
because a river runs right
through it.

01:14:27.154 --> 01:14:31.189
In fact, it's the very water
running through

01:14:31.191 --> 01:14:33.958
that over the ages has carved
the canyon.

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:35.961
Amazing.

01:14:35.963 --> 01:14:38.896
Hey, i think
we might've just answered

01:14:38.898 --> 01:14:41.033
captain maya's
mission question.

01:14:41.035 --> 01:14:43.769
Yes, canyons have rivers.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:46.238
Space explorers, go!

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.210
Space explorers, go!

01:14:51.212 --> 01:14:52.911
Fantastic work, guys.

01:14:52.913 --> 01:14:54.278
Your mission
was a great success.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.180
I knew it would be.

01:14:56.182 --> 01:14:58.917
And did you find out the answer
to your mission question?

01:14:58.919 --> 01:15:01.319
Yes, captain maya,
we sure did.

01:15:01.321 --> 01:15:03.454
Canyons have rivers.

01:15:03.456 --> 01:15:05.390
And you can even fish in them.

01:15:05.392 --> 01:15:06.992
That's amazing, team.

01:15:06.994 --> 01:15:08.926
You got the answer.
Good work.

01:15:08.928 --> 01:15:10.796
Thank you, captain maya.

01:15:10.798 --> 01:15:12.530
What's our next mission,
captain maya?

01:15:12.532 --> 01:15:14.065
This next mission

01:15:14.067 --> 01:15:16.502
is sure to be your most fun yet,
space explorers.

01:15:16.504 --> 01:15:19.337
We're sending you to africa
to study rivers.

01:15:19.339 --> 01:15:23.341
Rivers? How refreshing.

01:15:23.343 --> 01:15:25.077
I can't wait.

01:15:25.079 --> 01:15:28.412
Space explorers, go!

01:15:28.414 --> 01:15:30.082
Space explorers, go!
