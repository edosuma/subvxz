Uh, I'm samantha.

09:40.414 --> 09:41.880
I'm looking for olivia.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.248
Oh, I thought
you were my burrito.

09:43.366 --> 09:45.500
-Oh.
-Oh, hey.

09:45.636 --> 09:47.335
Hey, sorry, I tried calling.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.804
Oh. Yeah.
We're about to go jogging.

09:49.873 --> 09:51.840
This is samantha.
She's one my sponsees.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.709
Oh, hi, samantha.
I'm stephanie.

09:54.845 --> 09:55.844
Hi, stephanie,
it's nice to meet you.

09:55.979 --> 09:57.262
It's pronounced "stefani,"

09:57.347 --> 09:58.513
like gwen.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.681
Sorry.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.683
-It's okay.
-Baby, can I have five minutes?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.268
I thought we said
no more sponsees

10:03.353 --> 10:05.103
in the house, 'cause it's
like you're the coach

10:05.188 --> 10:07.322
-in<i> Friday night lights.</i>
-I know, but you love

10:07.407 --> 10:09.524
-that character.
-I know, but I don't love

10:09.660 --> 10:11.693
-being married
to that character.
-I know,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.862
but be my connie britton
and just give me this five...

10:13.997 --> 10:15.530
Okay, kyle chandler, I love you.
Five minutes.

10:15.666 --> 10:17.165
-Okay, I love you so much.
-Love you back.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.400
-You're my world. I love you.
-I love you. Beyond, beyond.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.536
-Yes.
-(exhales)

10:22.789 --> 10:24.506
okay, come on in.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.909
Cool leggings.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.011
Thanks.
My wife makes these.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.213
She's launching a girl-power
athleisure company.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.549
Girl boss-ton.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.052
Anyway, it's very funny,
it's extremely cute.

10:37.187 --> 10:40.088
-And I think
it's got a great message.
-Plus she's super hot.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.924
We've been together forever
and I'm obsessed with her still.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.226
Anyway, we have to go quick
or she'll kill me. What's up?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.445
Basically, I need money.
Like, a lot of it.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.864
'cause brit wants me
to pay for the party bus.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.199
You'd think she'd be able
to let that go

10:51.267 --> 10:53.201
since she's marrying
my ex-boyfriend, but no.

10:53.269 --> 10:55.403
She hit me up today,
while I was wearing a hairnet,

10:55.489 --> 10:57.906
-elbow deep in meat.
-That's a tough day.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.741
And, um, I can't ask my mom

10:59.826 --> 11:01.543
for money again,
'cause she'll own me, so...

11:01.628 --> 11:03.411
Well, the good news
is you don't have to do that.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.714
Oh, okay, good.
What do I do?

11:05.782 --> 11:08.216
Oh, um, I don't know.
(short chuckle)

11:08.301 --> 11:10.218
(short laugh)
what do you mean?

11:10.286 --> 11:11.670
Well, I'm not
your financial advisor.

11:11.755 --> 11:13.555
Part of your recovery
is to act like an adult

11:13.640 --> 11:15.256
in the world
and figure out a solution.

11:15.392 --> 11:17.592
Um, so...

11:17.678 --> 11:19.293
Sorry, but...

11:19.396 --> 11:21.262
What is the point
of talking to you?

11:21.398 --> 11:23.431
-Pardon?
-It's just, like,
you can't help me

11:23.517 --> 11:24.733
figure out the money stuff.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.735
You only tell me what not
to do, so I'm just trying

11:26.803 --> 11:30.121
to figure out, like,
what do you actually do?

11:32.008 --> 11:34.325
I help you stay sober
in this moment.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.710
Did you drink today?

11:35.796 --> 11:37.295
-No, but...
-Did you want to drink?

11:37.381 --> 11:38.680
Yes, that's why I came here.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.832
That's great.
I'm good at my job.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.300
What about everything else?

11:42.386 --> 11:44.436
All of those problems--
your mom, the money,

11:44.504 --> 11:45.970
your friends, your ex--

11:46.056 --> 11:47.505
those all stem
from your drinking.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.275
So... So what do I do?

11:50.360 --> 11:51.443
Don't drink.

11:51.511 --> 11:53.278
Right.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.230
Okay, so I have
to ask my mom for money.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.681
Ooh, who said that?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.450
Sorry to interrupt.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.652
I'm just grabbing josh.

12:00.737 --> 12:02.487
Thought you guys
would be done now.

12:02.572 --> 12:04.689
So... Hi, baby,

12:04.825 --> 12:06.624
-hi.
-(josh yowls)

12:06.693 --> 12:08.493
hi, joshy boy.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.464
Baby, we just need
two more minutes.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.499
Okay.

12:15.635 --> 12:17.802
Okay, you are smart

12:17.871 --> 12:19.387
and you don't need to solve
this problem right now.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.173
The only thing you need
to do is to stay sober today.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.842
One day at a time.

12:23.927 --> 12:25.844
Oh, boy, okay.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.013
Thank you.
Really nice to meet you.

12:29.149 --> 12:30.315
Love the leggings.

12:30.400 --> 12:31.683
Oh my god, thank you.
Wait, don't leave,

12:31.818 --> 12:32.717
don't leave.
I'll get you a pair.

12:32.853 --> 12:33.718
No, honestly, it's fine.

12:33.854 --> 12:34.853
-Take josh.
-Yep.

12:34.938 --> 12:35.987
Okay.

12:36.072 --> 12:37.522
Um, what size are you?

12:37.607 --> 12:39.023
-A small?
-I would've guessed that.

12:39.109 --> 12:41.526
They're so cute.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.698
Hey, mom?

12:46.783 --> 12:48.533
-Carol: Sam?
-I need s... Yeah?

12:48.618 --> 12:51.085
You're early.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.621
-For what?
-For nothing.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.907
For... I was...

12:56.009 --> 12:57.241
I wasn't expecting you home.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.409
I thought you had
one of your meetings.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.077
Oh, no, I only had two today.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.679
'cause I'm killing it.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.515
You must be samantha.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.350
I am.
Who are you?

13:05.418 --> 13:08.052
Bob.
Bob wolcowicz.

13:08.138 --> 13:10.855
-Bob is in
my spiritual book club.
-Yeah.

13:10.941 --> 13:13.558
-Ah.
-We're seeing each other.

13:13.643 --> 13:16.027
Romantically.

13:16.095 --> 13:17.695
Well, I'm...

13:17.764 --> 13:20.097
Very happy for you both.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.266
You did lie. You lied.
You want me out.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.268
So you can slut, slut, slut!

13:24.404 --> 13:27.104
You... You keep your voice down.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.106
He doesn't need to know
how volatile you are!

13:29.209 --> 13:30.942
Me? I'm the problem.

13:31.077 --> 13:34.278
(scoffs) you are the one
who is kicking out your

13:34.381 --> 13:36.447
own daughter,
your terribly in-debt daughter,

13:36.550 --> 13:39.083
who might wind up in jail
because she can't pay.

13:39.169 --> 13:41.052
But, ooh, you would
love that, wouldn't you?

13:41.137 --> 13:42.720
So you could be alone with bob!

13:42.789 --> 13:44.222
Not about bob!

13:44.307 --> 13:45.807
It's about me!

13:45.926 --> 13:48.426
I want to be alone
in my own house sometimes.

13:48.512 --> 13:51.062
It's not your house, it's dad's
house, it's all of our house!

13:51.130 --> 13:52.630
And now you want
to talk about dad.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.266
Samantha, I want
to get my groove back.

13:55.352 --> 13:58.469
I can't get my groove back
when you are always here.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.771
You are 28.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.573
Why do you care who I date?!

14:01.658 --> 14:03.658
I don't know!

(indistinct chatter)

14:52.175 --> 14:53.675
I just...

14:53.743 --> 14:56.911
I can't believe
I got that close.

14:57.013 --> 14:59.547
You're fine.
I've done so much worse.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.266
-No, you haven't.
-Sam,

15:01.384 --> 15:03.918
I used to blackout
and steal dogs.

15:04.020 --> 15:06.020
Like, I would wake up
just with a dog

15:06.089 --> 15:07.588
and not remember
how it got there.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.090
I just...

15:09.192 --> 15:10.858
I feel like that's kind of cute.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.194
-I'm a felon.
-Yeah, I could've been.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.697
They would've called me, like,
the doggy bandit or something.

15:15.765 --> 15:17.098
But they didn't.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.265
-They did not.
-You got away with it.

15:18.401 --> 15:19.701
I got away with it.

15:19.769 --> 15:21.369
I have so many dogs now.

15:21.437 --> 15:23.237
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm. Oh!

15:23.323 --> 15:25.907
And this one time I took
a little bit of my friend's

15:26.042 --> 15:28.376
mom's ashes and spread them
in the charles,

15:28.444 --> 15:30.578
because I thought it was
a nice thing to do.

15:30.714 --> 15:33.081
Okay, that makes me feel
a little bit better,

15:33.166 --> 15:35.116
'cause I don't think I've ever
spread anyone's ashes.

15:35.218 --> 15:36.918
Like, not even my own dad's.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.886
He's just sitting
on my mom's side table.

15:38.955 --> 15:40.254
Although she would probably
hit it now that she's

15:40.340 --> 15:41.472
schtupping her friend bob.

15:41.591 --> 15:43.290
It's always a bob.

15:43.393 --> 15:45.626
My mom has a bob,
but his name's daryl.

15:45.729 --> 15:47.929
Which is the bob
of black people. (short chuckle)

15:48.014 --> 15:50.098
(snorts, laughs)

15:52.268 --> 15:53.901
I didn't... I didn't know that.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.937
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

15:59.576 --> 16:01.409
thank you for picking me up.

16:01.477 --> 16:02.944
Yeah, of course.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.862
I just wanted
to show you my car, though.

16:04.948 --> 16:06.414
It's nice.

16:07.984 --> 16:09.784
We could just
go to good time sally's

16:09.869 --> 16:12.620
and relive that night
I have absolutely no memory of.

16:12.756 --> 16:15.123
Yeah, let's-let's go
relapse together, great.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.925
Well, we could skip the relapse
part and just do the sex thing.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.796
That sounds great.
But I can't.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.881
Because you're
kind of untouchable

16:23.967 --> 16:25.800
until you're
a year and a day sober.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.969
You're serious?

16:28.104 --> 16:30.171
Yeah.
It's, like, a famous thing.

16:30.306 --> 16:32.106
And I kind of have to be
a rules guys.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.808
Well, I would like
to go on the record

16:33.893 --> 16:35.443
as saying that rule blows.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.478
-Mm.
-Who can I complain to?

16:37.564 --> 16:39.781
Uh... No one.

16:39.866 --> 16:42.150
They just had to get
that day in there.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.985
Dicks.

16:44.120 --> 16:45.853
I never believed in ghosts

16:45.989 --> 16:49.023
-until I saw<i> ghost.</i>
-Love that movie.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.074
-Right?
-Yes.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.910
And it's true,
they-they are around.

16:52.996 --> 16:55.663
I have one in my house right now

16:55.749 --> 16:57.915
as we speak, I mean, he's not
haunting me or anything.

16:58.001 --> 17:00.134
He's just kind of hanging out.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.969
Like a college roommate

17:02.055 --> 17:03.638
who's girlfriend lives
in a better dorm.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.174
I always wanted to see ghosts,
but they never came to see me.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.093
I was sure my aunt nan
was gonna haunt me.

17:09.179 --> 17:11.429
She was such a bitch.
It would be just like her

17:11.514 --> 17:14.348
to come back from
the other side and torture me.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.850
Well, maybe you have
to come over to my place

17:15.935 --> 17:17.718
and meet my ghost roommate.

17:17.821 --> 17:19.353
-That could be good.
-Yeah.

17:19.489 --> 17:20.988
We could get little spooky.

17:21.057 --> 17:22.523
Yes, we can.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.242
(bob chuckles)

17:24.360 --> 17:26.494
-mmm.
-I'm gonna go pee.

17:26.562 --> 17:28.863
You stay here
and don't a move a muscle.

17:28.998 --> 17:30.531
Okay.

17:32.068 --> 17:34.368
-(high-pitched): Oil can.
-(door closes)

17:36.239 --> 17:37.789
if it isn't you again.

17:37.874 --> 17:40.041
Oh, it is you again.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.461
I like that we're becoming
more playful with each other.

17:43.546 --> 17:45.346
Where's my mom, bob?

17:45.414 --> 17:46.714
I killed her.

17:47.884 --> 17:49.884
I'm kidding.
I-I wouldn't kill her.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.803
(laughs)
I might.

17:51.888 --> 17:53.087
(chuckles)

17:53.223 --> 17:55.523
uh, all right, I'm gonna

17:55.591 --> 17:56.641
-go to my room.
-Okay.

17:56.726 --> 17:58.693
Hey, uh, before you go, I-I just

17:58.761 --> 18:00.528
wanted to say that...

18:00.613 --> 18:03.231
I think you're doing
a really great job.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.733
Thanks?

18:05.819 --> 18:08.536
I hit my bottom
a few years back.

18:08.604 --> 18:10.404
Not with alcohol.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.207
But... With
a near-death experience.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.208
Oh, my god.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.943
Yeah, I was skydiving,

18:16.045 --> 18:18.546
and you know at the end,
when you land and you run

18:18.631 --> 18:20.882
for a little bit?
Well, I fell over instead

18:20.967 --> 18:23.217
and got dragged and...

18:24.754 --> 18:26.420
...I broke my tibia.

18:28.124 --> 18:30.958
The-the near-death experience
was breaking your tibia?

18:31.094 --> 18:33.177
Yes.

18:33.263 --> 18:36.063
It was a near-death experience

18:36.132 --> 18:37.932
until it wasn't.

18:39.686 --> 18:41.435
So, anyway,
I went to physical therapy,

18:41.521 --> 18:44.906
and healed my tibia
and I discovered my-my

18:44.991 --> 18:46.991
true passion in life,
which is

18:47.110 --> 18:49.310
helping other people.
And I became

18:49.445 --> 18:51.996
a personal trainer, started
reading a lot of glennon doyle,

18:52.115 --> 18:54.949
which led the new me
to book club,

18:55.034 --> 18:57.484
which led me to carol, your mom,

18:57.587 --> 18:59.587
and I've never been happier.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.589
And that could be you.

19:03.659 --> 19:06.160
Well, thank you
for the pep talk, bob.

19:06.262 --> 19:08.462
Well, I-I hope it was helpful.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.164
-It was.
-Okay.

19:10.266 --> 19:12.633
I'm glad that we got
a chance to chat,

19:12.719 --> 19:15.887
because your mom speaks so...
So very highly of you.

19:15.972 --> 19:17.504
Mm, I bet.

19:17.607 --> 19:19.273
She told me all about
how you were the star

19:19.359 --> 19:21.508
of your soccer high school team

19:21.611 --> 19:23.311
and your time in new york
and working

19:23.396 --> 19:24.845
at that website bzzzzzzzzzz.

19:24.948 --> 19:26.647
That's a...
That's an awesome name.

19:26.783 --> 19:29.817
We even took one of your quizzes
the other day.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.986
W-what was the name of the quiz
we did the other day?

19:32.071 --> 19:35.072
"which ariana grande
boyfriend are you?"

19:35.158 --> 19:36.624
(laughing):
Yes!

19:36.709 --> 19:39.493
That's right!
I was, uh, pete davidson.

19:39.629 --> 19:41.796
Which makes sense,
because I am...

19:41.864 --> 19:44.749
Covered in crappy tattoos.

19:44.834 --> 19:48.336
-You are not.
-(chuckles)

19:48.421 --> 19:51.005
all will be revealed
in the fullness of time.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.641
You know what, actually, I think
I'm gonna go to felicia's

19:53.726 --> 19:56.310
'cause I haven't seen
her in a little while, so...

19:56.396 --> 19:59.513
-Love you.
-Love you.

20:03.937 --> 20:05.903
(grunting)

20:07.440 --> 20:08.990
nice initiative, samantha.

20:09.993 --> 20:11.075
Yeah, it's, uh,

20:11.194 --> 20:13.060
not as easy as it looks
when doris does it.

20:13.162 --> 20:14.328
Anyway, here's your paycheck.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.413
-Oh.
-It is, in all honesty,

20:15.531 --> 20:17.398
a very tiny amount of money.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.566
But I'll slot you in for a few
extra shifts next week.

20:19.702 --> 20:21.369
They're yours if you like cash.

20:21.504 --> 20:23.838
Yes, please, thank you.
I'll take anything.

20:23.906 --> 20:25.572
That's your first
sober paycheck.

20:25.675 --> 20:27.375
You should be proud.
