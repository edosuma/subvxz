12:46.741 --> 12:48.658
Keep the change.

12:48.693 --> 12:51.276
Well, that's
very generous of you,

12:51.312 --> 12:53.037
and I didn't get your name.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.773
That's okay. Come on, Oleg.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.483
Everyone's waiting to see you.

12:57.518 --> 12:58.726
Let's not keep them waiting.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.494
Ezra Bridger, welcome home.

13:08.530 --> 13:09.996
Who are you?

13:10.031 --> 13:11.031
You don't remember me?

13:11.999 --> 13:14.333
Jai Kell.

13:14.369 --> 13:16.313
Yeah, it's been a while since
our Academy days, hasn't it.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.053
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.673
You got me out of there.
Saved my life.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.985
This is my chance
to return the favor.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.379
Ryder kept sending me here
in hopes that you'd show up.

13:26.414 --> 13:27.641
I'll try to contact
someone for a pickup.

13:27.665 --> 13:29.173
(COMM BEEPING)

13:46.208 --> 13:47.417
(CHOPPER GRUNTING URGENTLY)

13:47.452 --> 13:48.452
We've been cut off.

14:00.081 --> 14:01.722
We need an exit, people. Fast!

14:01.757 --> 14:02.915
This way!

14:04.927 --> 14:06.168
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:09.032 --> 14:10.431
Uh, there's some rebels outside.

14:10.466 --> 14:11.924
They just blew up a speeder.

14:11.959 --> 14:13.439
STORMTROOPER: Out of the way.
Come on!

14:33.448 --> 14:35.251
Old Jho ran smuggler tunnels
throughout the town.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.232
Ryder told me about them once.

14:37.268 --> 14:39.560
Chopper, scan the system
and find us an exit.

14:39.596 --> 14:40.596
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

14:48.562 --> 14:50.680

another way.

(EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE)
You can always ask them.

14:55.820 --> 14:57.261
ZEB: (GROANING)
I hate the sewers.

15:05.079 --> 15:07.863
They went that way. Hurry.

15:07.899 --> 15:09.501
STORMTROOPER: It's an access
point for the sewer system.

15:09.525 --> 15:10.883
Did you know this wasn't sealed?

15:10.918 --> 15:13.685
I had no idea. Don't worry.

15:13.721 --> 15:15.441
There are only
so many places they can hide.

(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

15:29.570 --> 15:30.828
Great, you got us lost.

15:30.864 --> 15:33.447
I seem to remember these
tunnels lead to a junction

15:33.482 --> 15:35.316
beneath the main road
out of town.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.618
Well, that's a start. You
should activate your beacon

15:37.653 --> 15:39.381
so Ryder can come get us
once we're in the clear.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.097
Well, so much for disguises.

This way!

KANAN: Is this the right way?

16:30.331 --> 16:32.415
I... I don't know.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.450
I'll go take a look.

Please tell me you know
how to get out of here.

17:25.077 --> 17:26.961
Didn't you grow up in a sewer?

17:26.996 --> 17:28.654
I'm from the city.
I've never been here.

17:28.689 --> 17:30.064
Oh, what's the difference?

17:30.099 --> 17:32.174
Everything's different, Zeb.

17:32.209 --> 17:34.067
It's all changed, and this?

17:34.103 --> 17:36.078
This is my fault!

17:36.114 --> 17:38.405
I'm the one who pushed
for us to come back.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.048
I never thought
it'd be this bad.

17:40.084 --> 17:42.701
Ezra... Saw said it.

17:42.736 --> 17:44.311
I didn't wanna believe him.

17:44.346 --> 17:47.064
Lothal's gone. We already lost.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.233
Hey, we haven't lost.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.052
Forget Saw.

You said as long
as we're together,

17:52.747 --> 17:54.238
we've got a chance.

SABINE: That's my symbol.

18:02.131 --> 18:04.031
Ryder knows that.

18:04.066 --> 18:05.586
Maybe he left a trail
for us to follow.

18:05.610 --> 18:07.200
It's pointing this way.

destroyed all our probes.

their last-known coordinates

and send a squad to the

18:18.956 --> 18:20.131
to cut off their escape.

where they went.

Least I could do.
You came back here for us.

20:37.186 --> 20:39.264
Wasn't sure my message to the
Rebellion even got through.

20:39.288 --> 20:42.223
It did.
Mon Mothma sent us to help,

20:42.258 --> 20:44.350
and get intel
on the TIE defender.

20:44.385 --> 20:47.060
I'll brief you at my camp.

We need to plan an attack
on the TIE defender factory

of your forces arrive.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.535

anyone else coming.

20:54.570 --> 20:56.946
It's just us.

Wh... I don't understand.

20:58.516 --> 21:00.249
Just you?

locked down tight.

21:02.945 --> 21:05.128

This is how a rebellion starts.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.209
With a few people
standing together.

21:11.245 --> 21:14.814
We've done it before.
We can do it again.

21:14.890 --> 21:18.667
Well, we'll get a look
at the new fighter tomorrow.

21:18.703 --> 21:26.703
Then we'll see if you still feel
the same about our chances.
