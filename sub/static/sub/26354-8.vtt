00:20.396 --> 00:22.159
LOUISE: Ah, another day,
another dollar.

00:22.224 --> 00:23.792
TINA: It's not school
if you love what you do.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.870
Guys, I told Alex
I'd wait for him.

00:25.935 --> 00:27.909
Uh, are you two
gonna play that interesting,

00:27.974 --> 00:29.362
not-embarrassing game
you made up?

00:29.427 --> 00:30.489
What's it called? Robot

00:30.554 --> 00:31.703
Something Basement Time?

00:31.768 --> 00:33.886
RoboWizard Quest.
There he is.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.314
- Alex!
- (panting)

00:36.445 --> 00:37.941
I tried to run here
to meet you,

00:38.006 --> 00:39.136
but it turns out
I run

00:39.201 --> 00:40.321
slower than I walk,

00:40.386 --> 00:41.528
which was, um,

00:41.609 --> 00:43.214
was aletdown,
I'll be honest.

00:43.279 --> 00:46.470
COURTNEY: Gene.
Oh, Gene! Gene.

00:46.535 --> 00:47.962
Oh, hey, Courtney.
Doug.

00:48.027 --> 00:50.243
Gene, Courtney has a
little favor to ask you.

00:50.308 --> 00:51.933
Uh, okay.
What is it?

00:51.998 --> 00:53.100
It's a favor.

00:53.165 --> 00:55.047
Courtney,
get in jump position.

00:55.112 --> 00:56.630
Um, what are we,
what is...

00:56.695 --> 00:58.606
I need to see you lift
Courtney.

00:58.671 --> 00:59.874
You have to lift me.

00:59.939 --> 01:01.258
Courtney is here,
just so,

01:01.323 --> 01:02.547
and, Gene,
when she hops up,

01:02.612 --> 01:04.531
you just lift and turn
90 degrees,

01:04.596 --> 01:06.258
- and then you... No talking!
- I don't want to lift...

01:06.323 --> 01:07.308
Gene, shh!

01:07.386 --> 01:08.563
- Lift her!
- Lift me!

01:08.628 --> 01:09.958
Courtney, jump.
Jump!

01:10.023 --> 01:11.070
- Come on, Gene.
- Gene, lift!

01:11.135 --> 01:13.258
- (Gene straining)
- Lift me, Gene.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.851
- Come on.
- Lift!

01:14.916 --> 01:17.068
- Come on, let's go.
- Lift!

01:17.133 --> 01:18.492
Bravo.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.474
- That was really exciting.
- Wow.

01:20.539 --> 01:22.193
I wish
our dad made people lift us.

01:22.258 --> 01:24.473
- Okay, can I go now?
- No.

01:24.538 --> 01:27.013
Courtney's Roller-Dance Pairs
Competition partner

01:27.078 --> 01:28.357
Kelvin had to drop out.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.750
His parents' improv troupe

01:29.815 --> 01:31.023
is going on tour again.

01:31.088 --> 01:33.099
And her roller-dancing
competition

01:33.164 --> 01:34.234
is on Saturday.

01:34.299 --> 01:35.977
(whistles)
Sounds glamorous.

01:36.042 --> 01:37.174
Oh, it is, honey.

01:37.239 --> 01:38.576
The whir of the skates.

01:38.641 --> 01:40.010
The smell of the hairspray.

01:40.075 --> 01:41.310
The blood on the wood...

01:41.375 --> 01:44.365
My dad was Junior
Partners champion in 1983.

01:44.430 --> 01:45.933
- '84!
- Sorry, Dad.

01:45.998 --> 01:49.056
God, you get so weird
about roller-dancing.

01:49.121 --> 01:50.802
So, Gene,
what do you say?

01:50.867 --> 01:53.310
Can we count on you to be
our replacement?

01:53.375 --> 01:55.514
I've see you skate at the
school skating parties.

01:55.579 --> 01:57.138
You're... fine.

01:57.203 --> 01:59.248
We just need
a good sturdy boy

01:59.313 --> 02:00.871
for Courtney to skate around.

02:00.938 --> 02:02.829
Will you make me
the happiest

02:02.894 --> 02:04.457
skate dad
in the world?

02:04.522 --> 02:07.174
- Uh... no.
- What?

02:07.239 --> 02:08.982
Sorry,
but I'm not the sturdy,

02:09.047 --> 02:10.997
fine-at-skating boy
you're looking for.

02:11.062 --> 02:12.608
Now, excuse us,
Alex and I

02:12.673 --> 02:15.030
got to go see
a robot about a wizard.

02:16.188 --> 02:17.943
Huh,
that is so weird.

02:18.008 --> 02:19.115
Lin, are you still staring

02:19.180 --> 02:20.450
at that woman
sitting in her car?

02:20.515 --> 02:22.608
Yeah, she's been there
for hours, Bob.

02:22.673 --> 02:24.004
It's so spooky.
Ooh.

02:24.069 --> 02:26.322
Uh-huh.
Maybe she lives in her car.

02:26.387 --> 02:28.052
In a car like that?
No way.

02:28.117 --> 02:30.275
That car is nice.
I'd live in that car.

02:30.340 --> 02:32.870
Um, yeah. She's wearing
beautiful sunglasses, too.

02:32.935 --> 02:35.165
They look like Grantlys.
Very high-end.

02:35.230 --> 02:37.550
I watch a lot of makeover
shows, okay, Bob? Geez.

02:37.615 --> 02:39.457
Okay. (chuckles) I didn't
say anything, Teddy.

02:39.522 --> 02:40.652
Yeah, well,
you're judgy.

02:40.717 --> 02:42.315
You're making a face.
I see it.

02:42.380 --> 02:43.706
Okay, so she's wealthy

02:43.771 --> 02:45.385
and she's been sitting
in her car all day.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.838
That's a little weird.

02:46.903 --> 02:48.346
Oh, I know, she's probably

02:48.411 --> 02:49.635
here to assassinate
one of us,

02:49.700 --> 02:51.089
and she's working up
the courage.

02:51.154 --> 02:53.346
Hmm. Okay,
which one of us?

02:53.411 --> 02:54.463
Probably me.
Remember

02:54.528 --> 02:56.267
when I got hit on
the head a few weeks ago?

02:56.332 --> 02:58.031
Oh, when you walked into
a stop sign?

02:58.096 --> 03:00.402
Yeah. I probably
got a bad concussion,

03:00.467 --> 03:01.729
and I have amnesia.

03:01.794 --> 03:03.812
And "amnesia me"
went out at night

03:03.877 --> 03:05.617
and got in a high-stakes
poker game and won

03:05.682 --> 03:06.945
thousands of dollars from her

03:07.010 --> 03:08.562
with my amnesia poker skills,

03:08.627 --> 03:09.765
so now
she wants to kill me.

03:09.830 --> 03:11.182
She wants
to rip my friggin' head off.

03:11.247 --> 03:13.133
I bet she just walks
in here and does it.

03:13.198 --> 03:14.545
Just like that, dead.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.117
(jingling)

03:16.882 --> 03:20.448
Linda Belcher,
now you die.

03:20.513 --> 03:22.787
Aah, she got me,
she got me!

03:22.874 --> 03:24.904
TEDDY: Ooh, gun glasses.
Exciting.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.583
She's not here to kill
you with gun glasses, Lin.

03:27.648 --> 03:28.754
That's so mean, Bob.

03:28.819 --> 03:30.575
- Don't tell me I can't get killed.
- (door bells jingle)

03:30.640 --> 03:32.410
Yeah, Bob, don't tell your
wife she can't get killed.

03:32.475 --> 03:33.989
- Sorry.
- Hey, kids.

03:34.062 --> 03:35.996
- Good day at school?
- Oh, yeah.

03:36.061 --> 03:37.168
We all graduated early,

03:37.233 --> 03:39.027
- and we don't have to go anymore.
- Great.

03:39.092 --> 03:41.320
Enough chitchat.
RoboWizard Quest calls.

03:41.385 --> 03:43.480
Oh, right, the game.
Hi, Alex.

03:43.545 --> 03:44.715
Hey, Mr. Burger.

03:44.780 --> 03:45.797
It's Belcher.

03:45.862 --> 03:47.108
He answers to both.
It's fine.

03:47.173 --> 03:48.543
No, I-I don't.

03:48.608 --> 03:51.035
Wait, Tina, Louise,
are you guys gonna play, too?

03:51.100 --> 03:53.781
No. We watch and
mock it delightfully.

03:53.846 --> 03:55.509
All right, go have fun, kids.

03:55.740 --> 03:58.082
And now the robot
chooses a number.

03:58.147 --> 03:59.589
(imitating robot): Choosing.

03:59.654 --> 04:01.400
27.

04:01.487 --> 04:04.293
Oh, ho!
27 is way over there.

04:04.358 --> 04:06.285
And I must get there
by hopping

04:06.350 --> 04:09.943
only on circles that
add up to less than 27.

04:10.008 --> 04:12.346
(imitating wizard)
Or the wizard will be unleashed.

04:12.411 --> 04:15.440
Circles and math.
This really is the perfect game.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.863
Okay, here I go.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.349
(grunting): Six.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.075
- 12.
- That makes 18.

04:21.140 --> 04:23.286
Wrong. Oh, wait.
No, that's right.

04:23.826 --> 04:26.660
Oh, no!
I landed on ten.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.793
(laughing) I curse thee.

04:29.858 --> 04:31.691
I curse thee, Gene.

04:31.756 --> 04:35.302
- (moans)
- I command you to melt, robot.

04:35.397 --> 04:36.824
- Melt.
- No...

04:36.889 --> 04:38.472
Hey, kids.
Snack time.

04:38.537 --> 04:39.677
All right, here we go

04:39.742 --> 04:40.978
with some
pretzels and hummus.

04:41.043 --> 04:42.900
Oh, I love hummus.
♪ Hummus, hummus, hummus ♪

04:42.965 --> 04:45.041
- ♪ It's a yum-mus. ♪
- Little bit of a speed bump here.

04:45.106 --> 04:46.252
I can't have hummus.

04:46.317 --> 04:48.202
Why?
It's healthy.

04:48.267 --> 04:49.674
I am allergic to
sesame.

04:49.739 --> 04:52.025
It gives me, uh,
thunder down under.

04:52.090 --> 04:53.601
- Talking about diarrhea.
- Cool.

04:53.666 --> 04:56.295
But he's not allergic
to our secret handshake.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.900
BOTH (whispering):
Secret.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.886
Ooh, great handshake,
guys.

05:00.043 --> 05:01.377
TINA: Gene,
I don't know if I can wait

05:01.442 --> 05:02.518
while you wait for Alex.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.502
Jimmy Jr. started walking home
five minutes ago,

05:04.567 --> 05:06.072
and I like to be exactly
two minutes behind him.

05:06.137 --> 05:07.855
I'm sure
he'll be here soon.

05:09.215 --> 05:10.807
Courtney, I already told you

05:10.872 --> 05:12.272
I'm not doing your
roller thing.

05:12.337 --> 05:14.963
(scoffs) We're not
here for you. Calm down.

05:15.028 --> 05:17.471
- Um, hi, Gene.
- Alex. Finally.

05:17.536 --> 05:19.498
Shall we get down to
wizness?

05:19.563 --> 05:21.609
Um, not exactly.

05:21.674 --> 05:23.385
Looks like
some lucky duck

05:23.450 --> 05:25.229
is gonna be
Courtney's dance partner,

05:25.294 --> 05:27.229
and that
two thumbs is me.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.776
- Yay!
- What?!

05:28.841 --> 05:31.045
Come on, Alex,
let's roll. Get it?

05:31.110 --> 05:33.112
'Cause we're gonna
roller skate.

05:33.177 --> 05:34.948
(laughs) Bye, Gene.

05:35.013 --> 05:37.152
No!

05:37.239 --> 05:39.846
My friend.
That man took my friend!

05:39.911 --> 05:42.309
Not really.
It's not a kidnapping thing.

05:42.383 --> 05:43.699
Keep walking.

05:48.229 --> 05:49.965
Ah! Oh, hey, Gene.

05:50.068 --> 05:52.378
So, I assume it went terribly
with Courtney yesterday,

05:52.443 --> 05:53.690
and she was very annoying,

05:53.755 --> 05:56.042
and we'll be playing
RoboWizard Quest after school today?

05:56.107 --> 05:58.762
No, Gene,
I, uh... It was great.

05:58.880 --> 06:00.918
There was a lot of, um,
touching.

06:01.005 --> 06:03.471
Wait, do you
like-like Courtney?

06:03.536 --> 06:05.573
No!
I mean, yes.

06:05.638 --> 06:08.378
Not so much Courtney,
per Se, just, I mean,

06:08.443 --> 06:10.667
I like-like every girl
in our grade.

06:10.732 --> 06:11.909
And Strawberry Shortcake.

06:11.974 --> 06:14.691
I know she's not real,
but my feelings for her are.

06:14.805 --> 06:17.580
So, you want to roller-dance,

06:17.645 --> 06:19.182
instead of
playing the game?

06:19.247 --> 06:21.152
Oh, uh, Gene, Gene, Gene,
it's just...

06:21.247 --> 06:24.354
no girl ever has asked me
to do anything before.

06:24.419 --> 06:27.010
Plus, my mom is really excited
that I'm getting exercise.

06:27.075 --> 06:28.697
Even though mostly,
I just stand there

06:28.762 --> 06:30.674
while Courtneywhile Courtney skates
around and then I try to lift her.

06:30.739 --> 06:32.822
But it's hard, because the
doctor actually diagnosed

06:32.887 --> 06:35.057
- my arms with mainly calf muscles.
- Huh.

06:35.122 --> 06:36.314
Alex! (grunts)

06:36.379 --> 06:37.723
Hey, you're supposed
to catch me.

06:37.788 --> 06:39.236
Oh, was I?
I-I'm sorry.

06:39.301 --> 06:42.056
Don't be silly.
I was joking, partner.

06:42.121 --> 06:43.900
I mean, if you did catch
me, it would be pretty cool,

06:43.965 --> 06:45.595
but it's okay.
Oh, hi, Gene.

06:45.660 --> 06:46.978
Hi. So Alex,

06:47.043 --> 06:48.244
why don't we head
to lunch?

06:48.309 --> 06:49.870
Sorry, Gene,
he can't.

06:49.965 --> 06:51.986
The competition's in
three days, so Daddy said

06:52.051 --> 06:54.439
we have to verbally
rehearse at all times.

06:54.504 --> 06:56.415
And a-one, two, three, four.

06:56.480 --> 06:58.481
- Arabesque, arabesque.
- Jazz hands in place. Jazz hands.

06:58.546 --> 07:00.335
- Stand in place, stand in place.
- Chasse and toe-loop.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.052
- Here we go.
- No jazz hands.

The lady in the car.

08:08.673 --> 08:10.866
And she is definitely
staring at me.

08:10.931 --> 08:12.566
Creepy.
You know what I think she is?

08:12.631 --> 08:14.874
She's one of those ghosts
who doesn't know she's dead.

08:14.939 --> 08:16.608
Oh, you mean
dumb ghosts?

08:16.673 --> 08:17.796
Happens all the time.

08:17.861 --> 08:19.303
Probably,
her husband got killed

08:19.368 --> 08:21.366
right out there
on the sidewalk, right?

08:21.431 --> 08:24.712
Just walking along and, boom,
attacked and killed by a tiger.

08:24.777 --> 08:27.335
- But isn't she supposed to be the ghost?
- Yes, Bob.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.406
She died many years later,
of natural causes.

08:30.517 --> 08:32.836
But she never got over
her husband's tiger death,

08:32.914 --> 08:34.467
so she just sits there
in her car,

08:34.532 --> 08:35.600
waiting to see him.

08:35.664 --> 08:38.677
And she never gets to exercise
so she put on ten ghost pounds.

08:38.741 --> 08:41.155
(sighs) Both of you are nuts.
Oh, wait.

08:41.251 --> 08:43.874
She's getting out of her car,
and she's coming over here.

08:43.938 --> 08:46.077
- She's walking so slow.
- Yeah, ghost steps.

08:46.142 --> 08:47.742
She's not a ghost, Teddy.

08:49.728 --> 08:52.109
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no...

08:52.212 --> 08:56.280
- Okay, that was actually weird.
- I told you, Bob.

08:56.345 --> 08:58.772
Ooh, is her car a ghost, too?
Teddy, what do you think?

08:58.837 --> 09:00.859
- Ghost car. Ghost car.
- Oh, my God.

09:01.579 --> 09:02.858
BOB: Gene, you all right there, pal?

09:02.923 --> 09:05.977
That's macaroni and cheese
and you are... not eating it.

09:06.042 --> 09:08.280
You okay, my baby?
Let me feel your forehead.

09:08.345 --> 09:11.289
(sighs) I'm not sick,
I'm just, I don't know.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.190
His BFF up and BF-left.

09:13.255 --> 09:14.662
Oh, no.

09:14.740 --> 09:16.132
Did you and
Alex friend-break-up?

09:16.197 --> 09:17.522
I don't want
to talk about it.

09:17.587 --> 09:20.067
Alex agreed to be Courtney's
roller-dancing partner,

09:20.132 --> 09:22.592
so now Gene has to be
the wizard and the robot

09:22.657 --> 09:24.804
and the saddest boy
in the basement.

09:24.869 --> 09:26.866
Aw. Don't worry,

09:26.931 --> 09:28.733
I know a good friend
for you, Gene.

09:28.798 --> 09:31.202
She's about this tall
and her name is Mommy.

09:31.267 --> 09:33.594
(sighs) But Alex and I
had something special.

09:33.664 --> 09:36.124
And now he just wants to be
with Courtney and it's all over.

09:36.189 --> 09:37.593
Well, maybe you
should just go down

09:37.658 --> 09:39.382
to the roller rink
and support Alex.

09:39.447 --> 09:41.107
You could cheer for them
or whatever.

09:41.172 --> 09:43.116
You know,
that is really good advice.

09:43.181 --> 09:44.499
It is? I mean, yeah,

09:44.564 --> 09:46.327
I-I-I give good advice.

09:46.392 --> 09:48.873
And girls, you go with him
and be his wing ma'ams.

09:48.938 --> 09:51.412
I wouldn't mind seeing if there are
any teens in jeans down there.

09:51.477 --> 09:53.852
And I could lose thousands of dollars
in the claw machine.

09:53.917 --> 09:56.241
(sighs)
I guess I could go.

09:56.306 --> 09:58.138
- There's my boy.
- That's the spirit.

09:58.203 --> 09:59.888
Now,
how about having some dinn...

09:59.953 --> 10:02.349
Oh, you're-you're eating.
Maybe slow down?

10:02.414 --> 10:03.984
Never mind,
u-uh, do your thing.

10:04.049 --> 10:05.358
Look at him go.

10:06.266 --> 10:07.426
No, no!

10:07.513 --> 10:10.568
I said cross-hands.
Like that. Cross-hands.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.654
- It's right there in the name.
- ALEX'S MOM: Alex, honey?

10:12.719 --> 10:14.188
Do you need
a healthy snack?

10:14.253 --> 10:15.912
How about
some seaweed sheets?

10:15.977 --> 10:17.958
Mrs. Papasian, please!

10:18.023 --> 10:21.319
If he's got low blood sugar,
he loses focus!

10:21.398 --> 10:23.326
I have some sprouted
cashews

10:23.391 --> 10:24.796
- right here...
- He does not need

10:24.861 --> 10:26.010
sprouted cashews!

10:26.075 --> 10:28.468
Mrs. Papasian,
may I speak with you

10:28.533 --> 10:30.460
over near
the skate rental counter?

10:30.525 --> 10:31.814
W-Whoa! (grunts)

10:31.879 --> 10:34.087
Ow... Gene?

10:34.189 --> 10:36.624
Gene? Why are you here?
Are you here to mop?

10:36.689 --> 10:39.046
Hey, Alex, I thought
if you had any downtime,

10:39.111 --> 10:41.140
we could play our game
right here at the rink.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.163
Let me just tape a couple
of circles over here...

10:43.228 --> 10:45.077
Gene, no. I can play
that with you later.

10:45.142 --> 10:47.248
I'm here with Courtney and
she's dancing with me and her dad

10:47.313 --> 10:48.702
is yelling at me, and
why can't you just let me

10:48.767 --> 10:50.930
enjoy myself? Please.

10:51.123 --> 10:53.437
So apparently, I'm
just going to sit here

10:53.502 --> 10:55.741
and quietly support you, honey.

10:55.806 --> 10:57.710
All right, back to it, guys.

10:57.775 --> 11:00.152
Gene? Did you change your mind?
What are you doing here?

11:00.217 --> 11:02.577
- Nothing.
- You don't deserve my brother.

11:02.642 --> 11:05.094
Yeah, what she said.
But also, I'm just gonna...

11:05.237 --> 11:08.260
get the mop because we need it,
um, at the restaurant. Bye.

11:08.325 --> 11:10.070
- (doorbell rings)
- ALL: Not it.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.405
- Feet hurt.
- Huh. Maybe it's Alex.

11:12.470 --> 11:14.656
Maybe I got through
to him and he feels bad,

11:14.721 --> 11:17.327
and he quit roller-dance,
and he came to apologize.

11:17.392 --> 11:19.015
See? I knew you guys
would work it out

11:19.080 --> 11:20.484
because I'm great
at advice.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.174
Yeah, you are.
And at rubbing my feet.

11:23.239 --> 11:24.710
(sighs) Fine. Give them to me.

11:24.775 --> 11:26.726
- Yay!
- (laughs) Oh, that tickles.

11:26.791 --> 11:27.877
Ugh.

11:27.986 --> 11:29.702
- Doug?
- Hello, Gene.

11:29.767 --> 11:32.048
I have a proposition
for you.

11:32.182 --> 11:34.297
(thunder crashes)
I need you to help me

11:34.362 --> 11:36.455
make Alex disappear.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.696
No! Yes! What? Maybe.
Explain yourself?

11:44.799 --> 11:47.195
Make Alex disappear?
Why?

11:47.260 --> 11:49.437
Because Courtney will
never win with him, Gene.

11:49.502 --> 11:51.482
He can barely lift her,
his claps are weak

11:51.547 --> 11:53.531
and his mother's
no walk in the park, either.

11:53.596 --> 11:54.765
True. But no offense,

11:54.830 --> 11:56.507
I don't care
if they win or lose.

11:56.572 --> 11:58.681
I know.
Only I care if she wins.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.288
But you should care
that

12:00.353 --> 12:02.125
you could lose Alex
forever.

12:02.190 --> 12:04.374
No one knows
what that's like better than me.

12:04.439 --> 12:06.569
In the year 1984,
I was on top of the world,

12:06.657 --> 12:08.454
dancing Men's Synchronized Pairs

12:08.528 --> 12:10.183
with my best friend
Charlie Cross.

12:10.248 --> 12:12.703
And then he met
a girl skater named Sharon.

12:12.768 --> 12:14.485
He started skating
with her,

12:14.550 --> 12:16.665
and we
were never friends again.

12:16.773 --> 12:18.085
- Huh.
- And now

12:18.150 --> 12:20.547
they've been married
for 30 years.

12:20.612 --> 12:22.310
- It's awful!
- Yuck.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.937
Yeah.
So you got to step in, pal.

12:24.002 --> 12:25.247
Get Alex out of there and

12:25.312 --> 12:26.672
bring that trophy home.

12:26.737 --> 12:27.732
I mean, not really,

12:27.797 --> 12:29.195
I'll bring it home.
Don't touch it!

12:29.260 --> 12:31.273
Don't touch the trophy.
And then, I promise you,

12:31.338 --> 12:33.632
I will find her a partner
for the next competition,

12:33.697 --> 12:35.304
and you and Alex can
go right back to doing

12:35.369 --> 12:36.595
whatever the hell you want.

12:36.705 --> 12:38.875
(moans) Fine.
I'll do it.

12:38.940 --> 12:41.031
(chuckles): Attaboy.
There's got to be something

12:41.096 --> 12:42.902
that you know that
we can use against him.

12:43.010 --> 12:45.282
Well, sesame gives him
diarrhea.

12:45.362 --> 12:46.547
Yes, that's perfect.

12:46.612 --> 12:48.179
You can put some
in a drink or something

12:48.244 --> 12:49.867
and give it to him
right before showtime.

12:49.932 --> 12:51.351
- Me?
- Yes. It would be

12:51.416 --> 12:52.907
too suspicious
if it came from me.

12:52.972 --> 12:56.414
Then, when he gets the runs,
you run to the rescue.

12:56.479 --> 12:58.851
Don't I need to, like,
learn the routine?

12:58.916 --> 13:02.071
You just need to nail the lift,
which I know you can do.

13:02.151 --> 13:04.071
See you at 10:00 a.m.
sharp.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.750
- LOUISE: Gene.
- Ah! Wait.

13:06.815 --> 13:08.078
How much of that
did you hear?

13:08.143 --> 13:09.240
All of it. I can't believe

13:09.305 --> 13:10.843
you're gonna give Alex
diarrhea.

13:10.908 --> 13:13.509
I mean, it's hilarious,
but I thought you liked him.

13:13.596 --> 13:15.987
Yeah, you're not really
gonna do that, right, Gene?

13:16.052 --> 13:18.632
Damn right I am, sister.
I'll do whatever it takes

13:18.697 --> 13:20.047
to get my buddy back, including

13:20.112 --> 13:21.578
making him diarrhea himself

13:21.643 --> 13:22.765
at a roller rink.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.992
It's really the only way
to show someone you care.

13:25.057 --> 13:26.237
I know.

13:28.501 --> 13:29.675
Good morning, kids.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.398
Who's excited
to wipe down menus?

13:31.463 --> 13:33.257
I don't know,
a psychopath?

13:33.322 --> 13:34.679
Kids, it's Saturday,
which means

13:34.744 --> 13:35.937
we might get customers,

13:36.002 --> 13:37.437
so we might need
your help.

13:37.502 --> 13:38.953
But Dad, we're taking
your advice

13:39.018 --> 13:40.006
and going to support Alex

13:40.071 --> 13:42.273
and Courtney in their
roller-dancing competition.

13:42.338 --> 13:44.171
Oh, wow.
Yeah. Great.

13:44.236 --> 13:47.328
Since it was my advice,
you should probably go.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.898
Yep. And we aren't going
there to try to stop Gene

13:49.963 --> 13:51.830
from doing anything bad
to Alex at all.

13:51.895 --> 13:53.432
Okay.

13:53.510 --> 13:56.007
Aw, my little supportive
seagulls.

13:56.072 --> 13:58.078
And I want to bring
Alex his favorite drink,

13:58.143 --> 14:00.007
which is anything
that has sugar in it.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.664
Mother, may I have
a brown soda to go?

14:02.729 --> 14:04.296
- Of course.
- Um,

14:04.361 --> 14:05.750
w-what's
in your hand, Gene?

14:05.815 --> 14:07.549
A spoonful of hummus.
No reason.

14:07.619 --> 14:09.640
Ooh, fun.
Walking hummus. I love it.

14:09.705 --> 14:12.250
That seems... (groans)
Just bring the spoon back.

14:12.315 --> 14:14.517
Oh, and you should probably
give me 100 quarters.

14:14.582 --> 14:15.908
- Here's three.
- Mm.

14:15.973 --> 14:17.392
Have fun, kids.

14:18.865 --> 14:21.194
All right, time to get
my paws on some claws.

14:21.259 --> 14:23.717
Good luck ruining Alex's
life and/or outfit, Gene.

14:23.782 --> 14:25.381
Gene, are you sure
you want to do this?

14:25.446 --> 14:26.890
If you give Alex
hot sesame squirts

14:26.955 --> 14:28.859
and he finds out,
he may never forgive you.

14:28.924 --> 14:30.613
It's a chance I got to take, Tina.

14:30.678 --> 14:31.839
Gene.

14:32.044 --> 14:33.860
- Hi, how are you?
- Welcome.

14:33.925 --> 14:35.416
Roller rinks, huh?
Lot of fun?

14:36.128 --> 14:37.532
(gasps) She's back!

14:37.597 --> 14:39.478
BOB: Something weird
is definitely going on.

14:39.543 --> 14:41.589
- LINDA: She's coming our way.
- TEDDY: W-What should we do?

14:41.654 --> 14:43.376
Nothing.
She's just a person, Teddy.

14:43.441 --> 14:44.954
Yeah, I'm not taking
any chances, Bobby.

14:45.019 --> 14:47.219
This is it.
She's really coming this time.

14:47.284 --> 14:48.844
Nope.
No, back to the car.

14:48.909 --> 14:50.325
Wait, wait,
she's coming back again.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.087
TEDDY: What's happening
out there? You guys alive?

14:52.152 --> 14:53.704
Nope, nope, never mind.
There she goes again.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.187
- Oh, okay, that's it.
- Bob, what are you doing?

14:56.252 --> 14:58.274
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- TEDDY: Don't do it, Bobby!

14:58.339 --> 15:00.219
I'll be fine, Teddy.
I'm just gonna figure out

15:00.284 --> 15:01.625
- what's going on.
- Okay,

15:01.690 --> 15:03.961
but if she starts dragging
you to Hell, give me a signal.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.790
- Like this.
- That's just waving.

15:05.890 --> 15:07.744
- Okay, like this.
- Perfect.

15:09.510 --> 15:10.729
Huh?

15:11.049 --> 15:13.351
Hi. Uh, I work at that
restaurant right there.

15:13.416 --> 15:14.859
My name is Bob and, um,

15:14.924 --> 15:18.187
I just wanted to check and
see if everything is okay?

15:18.252 --> 15:21.279
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I'm Brenda, and I...

15:21.344 --> 15:22.742
(crying)

15:23.016 --> 15:27.827
I only have, have to go
into one public place,

15:28.157 --> 15:29.998
and I can't even do it!

15:30.063 --> 15:31.893
I'm a little confused.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.263
I'm agoraphobic,

15:33.328 --> 15:35.451
and my doctor wants me
to face my fears

15:35.516 --> 15:37.257
by going
into a public place.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.256
So, I chose your restaurant
to go into

15:39.321 --> 15:41.327
because it's usually
pretty empty. No offense.

15:41.392 --> 15:42.920
No, it's okay.
It's true.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.272
But I'm just too nervous.

15:44.353 --> 15:46.623
What if there's a fire and
then I get trapped in there,

15:46.688 --> 15:47.732
and then I'm trampled,

15:47.797 --> 15:50.196
and what if the lady
in the glasses hits me?

15:50.261 --> 15:52.633
No, that's my wife.
She won't hit you, I don't think.

15:52.698 --> 15:54.587
- Oh, God!
- No, I mean, she definitely won't.

15:54.652 --> 15:56.953
L-Look, would it help
if I walked you in?

15:57.018 --> 15:59.585
I-I don't know.
Maybe that could work.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.531
Li-Lin. (shushing)

16:03.596 --> 16:05.418
Just be calm.
Please, be calm.

16:05.483 --> 16:06.946
- Hi! -(screams)
- Oh, God!

16:07.011 --> 16:08.031
What's the matter?
What's the matter?

16:08.096 --> 16:09.966
- What'd I do? What'd I do?
- No, no, no, no...

16:10.857 --> 16:12.196
Oh. Hey, Gene.

16:12.261 --> 16:14.008
Hey. Sorry about the other day.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.541
Oh, that's okay.
I freak out a lot, too.

16:16.606 --> 16:19.409
Cool, well, I brought
you a soda for good luck.

16:19.474 --> 16:21.776
Wow. Hey, thanks, Gene.

16:24.802 --> 16:26.952
Actually, um, I'm sorry

16:27.017 --> 16:29.100
I stopped playing
RoboWizard Quest with you.

16:29.165 --> 16:31.671
I just got so excited
to be around a girl.

16:31.736 --> 16:34.054
Thanks for understanding.
You're a good friend.

16:34.767 --> 16:37.091
I mean, probably my best friend.

16:38.192 --> 16:39.313
(coughs)

16:46.401 --> 16:48.374
- No!
- What the heck, Gene?

16:48.439 --> 16:50.039
I'm a bad friend!

16:50.104 --> 16:51.664
What?
What's going on?

16:51.880 --> 16:54.952
Alex, I was gonna trick you
and make you drink sesame stuff

16:55.017 --> 16:57.509
so that you'd get diarrhea and
then I could take your place

16:57.574 --> 16:59.577
as Courtney's partner
because Doug wanted me to

16:59.642 --> 17:01.996
because you can't lift Courtney
and your claps are weak,

17:02.061 --> 17:04.614
so I said I would do it,
but I can't do it!

17:04.679 --> 17:08.102
I don't want to give
you diarrhea. I'm sorry!

17:08.275 --> 17:10.888
Gene, I am mad that you
wanted to give me diarrhea,

17:10.954 --> 17:13.715
but I'm really happy that
you decided not to do it.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.888
'Cause Gene, it is a mess.

17:15.986 --> 17:17.375
- Friends?
- Friends.

17:17.440 --> 17:19.739
(both grunting)

17:19.804 --> 17:22.465
Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should replace me.

17:22.531 --> 17:25.654
I like trying to lift Courtney,
but I am not good at it.

17:25.719 --> 17:27.301
I mean, I did it once,
for a second,

17:27.367 --> 17:28.919
but then
we both fell over.

17:28.984 --> 17:31.147
And actually,
her knee fell on my mouth.

17:31.226 --> 17:33.686
And also,
my claps are weak. See?

17:33.835 --> 17:36.889
- Huh.
- Here. All the way back. And...

17:37.101 --> 17:40.240
Wow. Yeah.
There was literally no sound.

17:40.305 --> 17:42.107
But I still don't think
I should replace you.

17:42.172 --> 17:44.639
I've got a better idea.
Let's go find Courtney.

17:44.704 --> 17:46.134
LINDA: Agoraphobia?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.896
- Yes, Lin.
- But we don't have spiders in here.

17:48.961 --> 17:51.325
- No, that's arachnophobia.
- Oh.

17:51.390 --> 17:53.825
She's afraid of public
spaces and people.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.765
- Oh, like Howard Huge.
- Hughes.

17:55.830 --> 17:57.618
- Yeah. What did I say?
- (sighs) Huge.

17:57.683 --> 17:59.168
- Huge.
- Oh, my God. All right.

17:59.233 --> 18:00.575
Let's try to focus here,
guys. All right?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.973
We need to help Brenda
and she agreed to come back

18:03.038 --> 18:05.122
on a few conditions,
and I need you guys to listen.

18:05.187 --> 18:07.028
I'm gonna open the door
and give her a wave,

18:07.093 --> 18:08.270
and then
she's gonna come in,

18:08.335 --> 18:11.161
- but you cannot talk to her.
- You got that, Teddy?

18:11.226 --> 18:12.872
- Eh...
- Neither of you can talk to her.

18:12.937 --> 18:14.559
- And don't look at her, either.
- Okay.

18:14.624 --> 18:16.856
I'm just gonna look at this
spot right here on the counter.

18:16.921 --> 18:19.731
Wait, where'd it go?
Shoot. No, I lost the spot!

18:19.796 --> 18:21.476
- I lost the spot, Bobby! Don't let her in!
- Teddy, just calm down.

18:21.541 --> 18:22.762
- Don't let her in!
- Calm down.

18:22.827 --> 18:24.911
Okay, you guys are
clearly ready,

18:24.976 --> 18:26.789
so let's just do this.

18:28.429 --> 18:29.935
Look away, look away.

18:30.565 --> 18:33.265
(gasping)

18:36.237 --> 18:38.841

18:38.906 --> 18:40.243

18:40.308 --> 18:41.711
- Hi, I'm Linda!
- (shouts)

18:41.776 --> 18:43.565
You know, my cousin's
afraid of church bells.

18:43.630 --> 18:44.781
Guys, no.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.850
Oh, no, we blew it.

18:47.915 --> 18:49.152
(door bells jingle)

18:49.225 --> 18:51.332
Thank you.
I'll be back tomorrow.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.823
(gasps) We did it! We did it!

18:53.888 --> 18:56.643
Yay! Now she'll never
have any more problems.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.800
Yeah, she was kind of annoying,
though. Right?

19:00.388 --> 19:01.924
And now taking the stage,

19:01.989 --> 19:04.369
Courtney Wheeler
and Alex Papasian.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.690
(laughs) We'll see about that.
