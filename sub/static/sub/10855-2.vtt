WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:03.740
I'm Catherine, by the way. I'm 47,
I'm divorced, I live with my sister

00:03.800 --> 00:07.440
who's a recovering heroin addict.
I have two grown-up children.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.740
One dead, one who doesn't speak
to me, and a grandson.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.900
How would you like to make
half a million pounds?

00:11.960 --> 00:14.140
You're talking about kidnapping her?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.140
Some bastard's got our Annie.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.740
And he wants a million quid.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.300
Are you here to report a crime?

00:19.360 --> 00:21.900
Nevison could afford to lose
half a million pounds easily.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.220
Any more and he might go to the
police.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.700
Oh, Becky, me daughter.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.700
Died just after Ryan was born.

00:28.760 --> 00:29.860
She was raped.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.780
I'm terrified if Ryan's like him
in any way shape or form.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.820
Which he's bound to be, isn't he?

00:33.880 --> 00:37.060
Tommy Lee Royce is out of
prison. Why didn't you tell me?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.640
I didn't want to upset you.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.220
You look after yourself, love.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.920
I will be in touch.
OK, thanks a lot, bye-bye.

Bravo November 45.
Operation Greensleeves.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.980
Sighted, the ice-cream van outside
Wilberforce House in Sowerby Bridge.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.840
I'm going after it, I'm on foot.

01:28.520 --> 01:31.180
Registration Hotel Kilo 11
Romeo November X-ray.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.920
I'm going after it, I'm nearly with
it, I'm going to stop it.

01:36.960 --> 01:39.140
5-0. Come on.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.180
Dad, 5-0.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.300
'45, do not chase the vehicle
on foot.'

01:43.360 --> 01:44.760
Yeah, whatever.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.540
Oi!

01:48.600 --> 01:49.940
Pull over!

01:50.000 --> 01:52.960
Oi! Oi!

02:00.360 --> 02:01.980
Failed to stop.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.340
Off-side window smashed.
Two occupants.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.700
Both white, male, one with
a sleeve tattoo, dark hair, beard,

02:07.760 --> 02:09.940
pale blue T-shirt,
khaki body-warmer,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.580
the other ginger hair, beard,
pasty-faced, pink hoodie.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.760
Driving off towards Wharf Street.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.360
You're getting too bloody old
for this, Catherine, love.

We're going to have to take it

We're going to have to borrow a bit
from here, there and everywhere,

03:39.040 --> 03:40.660
that's how we can do it.
You're not to tell anyone,

03:40.720 --> 03:44.220
they get a whiff anyone else knows,
they say they're going to start doing
stuff...

03:44.280 --> 03:46.100
to her. I won't. I won't.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.540
And they must be watching me,
they know things.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.980
These people are often very...
very highly organised.

03:50.040 --> 03:53.700
For months! Following me.
Following Ann!

03:53.760 --> 03:55.420
Jesus! We can...

03:55.480 --> 03:56.900
I can look into how much
you can take out of the business

03:56.960 --> 03:58.620
if that's...
I've got maybe 200 grand

03:58.680 --> 04:00.500
I can lay my hands on immediately,
but even then,

04:00.560 --> 04:03.140
are they going to let me
withdraw that amount in cash,

04:03.200 --> 04:04.700
without asking bloody questions?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.020
Well, it's your money.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.580
Yeah, but they're going to think
I'm laundering money,

04:07.640 --> 04:09.060
then they're going to tell
the police!

04:09.120 --> 04:11.300
Really? Well, I would!

04:11.360 --> 04:14.020
Why would anyone be withdrawing
that amount in cash

04:14.080 --> 04:15.420
if it wasn't dodgy? I...

04:15.480 --> 04:18.540
We'll get it, we'll get it,
I'll raise it.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.220
I'll ring what's-his-name.
At the bank.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.020
I'll say, I'll just say, "I want to
withdraw 200 grand in cash,"

04:23.080 --> 04:24.220
see what he says. Sure.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.060
"How soon can you have it?" Sure.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.260
Yeah, see if it can be done without
anybody sticking their bloody...

04:28.320 --> 04:29.900
noses in. Sure.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.140
Pay the money, get her back,
safe and sound, and then find out

04:33.200 --> 04:34.360
who the little...

04:35.440 --> 04:36.860
..are and choke 'em with it!

04:36.920 --> 04:38.600
Absolutely.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.300
Absolutely.

04:41.360 --> 04:45.120
Get me Adam Stapleton on the phone
and tell him it's important, please.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.620
Outside the Chinese
up Rawson Lane?

04:49.680 --> 04:50.720
Yeah.

04:51.760 --> 04:52.740
How d'you know it was him?

04:52.800 --> 04:55.140
Er...because I'm not blind?

04:55.200 --> 04:56.460
'No, come on...

04:56.520 --> 04:57.900
'He's been in prison
for God knows how long.'

04:57.960 --> 04:59.380
It was him.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.440
'Fine, OK. Fine, fine.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.840
'Even if it was...' Yes?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.200
"Even if it was..."?

05:09.920 --> 05:11.740
What time's your dinner break?

05:11.800 --> 05:15.020
You pushed it as far as you could
after Becky died.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.860
You did everything you could,
Catherine.

05:17.920 --> 05:21.940
Everybody knows what he is, the fact
that the CPS couldn't run with it

05:22.000 --> 05:26.000
is bad, it's awful,
everyone knows that, but...

05:27.520 --> 05:28.560
What?

05:29.840 --> 05:33.460
I worry about you.
Getting yourself all upset

05:33.520 --> 05:36.420
and obsessed with it all over again.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.460
That subhuman piece
of rotting excrement

05:38.520 --> 05:40.940
should be on the Sex Offenders'
Register. And he isn't.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.860
I think that's something worth
getting obsessed and upset about.
Don't you?

05:43.920 --> 05:46.300
You're never going to be able
to approach this objectively.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.940
you're going to make yourself ill
again.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.900
He's on my patch.
You think I'm going to ignore it?

05:50.960 --> 05:53.660
Sooner or later, unless somebody
marks his card for him, big style,

05:53.720 --> 05:54.940
he's going to hurt someone else.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.460
Is that what you're going to do?
Mark his card for him?

05:56.520 --> 05:58.620
It's my job.
How? How're you going to do it?

05:58.680 --> 06:00.460
The less you know, Clare.

06:00.520 --> 06:04.740
You see, that - saying something
like that - just makes me

06:04.800 --> 06:06.920
even more worried that you're not...

06:11.040 --> 06:14.260
What? Not going to deal with it
rationally.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.900
Rationally? I've no intentions
of dealing with it rationally.

06:17.960 --> 06:20.040
I'm amazed you'd think
anybody'd expect me to.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.420
You're winding me up.
My intention

06:23.480 --> 06:26.200
is to deal with it effectively.

06:27.360 --> 06:31.260
All right, well, you've heard what
I'm saying. I worry about you, OK?

06:31.320 --> 06:32.860
You worry about me...

06:32.920 --> 06:34.820
staying on the wagon.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.840
I worry about you.

06:38.200 --> 06:40.120
You're the only sister I've got.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.380
Catherine!

06:49.440 --> 06:50.700
Joyce!

06:50.760 --> 06:55.820
Mrs Godley, Turnpike Street, Elland,
just rung the desk line to say,

06:55.880 --> 06:58.700
"Them lads in that ice-cream van,
they are at it again."

06:58.760 --> 07:00.260
Right now? Right now.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.500
Job on, boys and girls!
I need everybody.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.220
The ice-cream man cometh!
Let's go, go, go and get him.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.020
And you make sure you're tooled up
properly this time, lady.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.540
45 to 9242.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.860
'9242, go ahead.'

07:12.920 --> 07:15.140
What's your location, Shaf?
it's all hands on deck.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.700
'We're just on by wharf.'

07:16.760 --> 07:18.700
Bravo November 45 to Control.
Go ahead, 45.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.700
Have we a mobile unit,
double crewed?

07:20.760 --> 07:23.900
I need 'em for a back-up job on
Turnpike Street in Elland.
Silent approach,

07:23.960 --> 07:25.320
rendezvous on Cemetery Road.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.840
There you go, enjoy.

07:36.400 --> 07:39.280
Can I have two of them what he
had? Here y'are.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.240
5-0. What?

07:55.680 --> 07:56.960
Oi!

07:58.800 --> 07:59.880
Get off!

08:02.080 --> 08:04.380
Stay where you are!

08:04.440 --> 08:06.460
Right. Hold him down.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.420
Calm down! Stop moving.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.700
Stop wriggling,
you're not going anywhere.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.540
What's in your pockets? Nothing.
Eh? Nothing!

08:13.600 --> 08:15.780
What's your name? Nothing!

08:15.840 --> 08:17.620
Right. Well, I'm arresting you, OK?

08:17.680 --> 08:20.020
On suspicion of supplying drugs,
d'you understand?

08:20.080 --> 08:23.780
You don't have to say anything, but
it may harm your defence if you...

08:23.840 --> 08:24.940
Stop wriggling!

08:25.000 --> 08:28.860
..if you do not mention when
questioned something you later rely
on in court.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.580
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

08:32.880 --> 08:37.460
Those are well expensive ice creams
you're flogging, Alfie.

08:37.520 --> 08:41.600
'Selling your own home and saving
thousands of pounds in the bargain.

08:43.159 --> 08:46.800
'Single mum, Millie Spencer,
wants to move to a smaller house...'

08:50.160 --> 08:51.600
How's things?

08:52.880 --> 08:53.920
Good.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.520
She been all right?

08:58.680 --> 08:59.720
In what sense?

09:00.920 --> 09:03.100
Well, keeping quiet,
behaving 'erself.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.480
Yeah.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.100
Right, well, you can clear off
for a few hours.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.560
I'll see to things here. OK.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.080
Have you fed her?

09:22.600 --> 09:23.720
Er...no.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.920
What happens if she needs a wee?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.920
There's a bucket.
Have you not tied her to chair?

09:35.200 --> 09:36.240
Oh, yeah.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.000
So...?

09:47.440 --> 09:49.260
Tell you what.
I'll go down and check, shall I?

09:49.320 --> 09:51.260
Leave her. Eh?

09:51.320 --> 09:52.460
Leave her.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.440
Leave her!

09:56.000 --> 09:57.400
She's fine.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.500
Like I said, you can go.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.580
I'm OK here.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.860
Ashley's got stuff he needs doing.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.060
He doesn't need two of us here,
we do shifts.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.800
You think you're the bastard
who gets to watch telly all day?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.380
Is he...? Not in?

11:17.440 --> 11:20.340
No, he's popped home. Why...

11:20.400 --> 11:22.940
Probably catch him on his mobile.
If it's important.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.260
Yeah, sure.

11:24.320 --> 11:25.840
Sure.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.380
I didn't want to tell you
until it was over and done with.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.140
But...I can't think straight,
I don't know what to do.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.820
We've got to ring the police.
They're watching us. They'd know.

11:47.880 --> 11:50.500
And then God knows what they'd...
How?

11:50.560 --> 11:54.220
They...might even have the phones
bugged. We just...

11:54.280 --> 11:56.960
We just don't know, do we?
But they are organised, Helen.

11:58.800 --> 12:03.420
Didn't we used to know
someone in the CID? Neil Mitchell.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.640
They're not going to get away with
this, Helen.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.220
Please give him a ring.
We're going to go to the police

12:10.280 --> 12:12.880
after...after we've got her back.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.400
They're not going to get away
with it.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.800
There's no need to be frightened.
All right?

13:45.960 --> 13:47.000
Bitch.

13:49.120 --> 13:52.380
If everything goes down like it
should, you're not going to get
hurt.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.620
OK?

13:58.080 --> 13:59.780
You need to stop crying, bitch,

13:59.840 --> 14:03.320
otherwise you're just going to
annoy me, and there's no need.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.640
Do you want anything to eat?

14:15.680 --> 14:18.300
Do you want to...

14:18.360 --> 14:20.200
Do you need to use the bucket?

14:21.480 --> 14:23.280
I won't look.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.400
Right, well, um...

14:28.200 --> 14:30.140
I'll be back in a bit.

14:30.200 --> 14:34.380
And you see if - when - I can trust
you,

14:34.440 --> 14:38.400
I'll be able to unfasten you.
So you can...

14:40.000 --> 14:41.320
And everything, so...

14:55.240 --> 14:57.120
Are them...?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.660
OK, well, d'you want to keep it
behind the counter?

15:46.720 --> 15:50.060
Tell everybody who works here
and if he does come in,

15:50.120 --> 15:54.020
if you recognise him, if you see him
looking at your menu out there,

15:54.080 --> 15:56.680
if you see him walk past, anything,
can you...

15:58.560 --> 16:00.020
..give us a ring?

16:00.080 --> 16:02.980
Don't challenge him, don't approach
him, don't say anything.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.580
Just act normally, serve him,
whatever,

16:06.640 --> 16:08.520
and then ring me.

16:18.680 --> 16:20.760
Hello? 'Are we allowed to fuck her?'

16:23.760 --> 16:25.020
Ashley?

16:25.080 --> 16:26.780
'Why would you be asking me that,
Lewis?'

16:26.840 --> 16:28.220
Look, I'm just asking.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.140
You're a sick little bastard,
aren't you?

16:30.200 --> 16:31.420
'No, no,'

16:31.480 --> 16:33.340
it isn't me. It's...

16:33.400 --> 16:34.540
Is he there?

16:34.600 --> 16:36.440
'Weirdo. I sent him over.'

16:38.040 --> 16:39.580
Yeah.

16:39.640 --> 16:41.440
'I think he's had her...in cellar.'

16:43.000 --> 16:44.180
Why, what...?

16:44.240 --> 16:46.060
What makes you think that, Lewis?

16:46.120 --> 16:49.420
'Well, he's had her knickers off,
anyway.

16:49.480 --> 16:52.040
'So I were just...
I were just asking, really.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.360
'That weren't...that isn't...

16:56.880 --> 16:59.280
'That wasn't part of the plan.
Is it?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.220
'Ashley?'

17:04.280 --> 17:08.680
Well, Lewis, I don't want you
to feel that it's obligatory.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.420
You mean you told him to do that?

17:11.480 --> 17:13.240
No. No, I didn't.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.859
Sounds to me like he were just
using his initiative.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.079
Right, well, I'm not...

17:20.520 --> 17:22.160
I don't want to...that's...

17:24.319 --> 17:25.740
I'm not doing that.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.619
'I'm not asking you to, Lewis.'

17:27.680 --> 17:30.020
Good. Cos if this goes tits up,

17:30.080 --> 17:32.860
I'm not the noncy weirdo bastard
that's getting done for rape.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.580
Granny's been in a fight.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.920
Oh, God. Is it bad?

17:54.440 --> 17:57.060
She was chasing this scrote,
and he kicked her in the face.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.820
Did he get away? Hell, no!

17:58.880 --> 18:00.860
What'd he been doing?

18:00.920 --> 18:03.540
Selling ice creams. Oh.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.500
OK. Are you going to get changed?

18:06.560 --> 18:09.260
Yep. Are you OK?

18:09.320 --> 18:11.580
Yeah, couple of Nurofen,
I'll be like new.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.680
Have you not taken something
before? I've not had time.

18:19.080 --> 18:22.360
Daniel rang. He's invited us
over for tea tomorrow.

18:24.400 --> 18:26.020
All of us? Well...

18:26.080 --> 18:28.340
I said I'll see if Ryan can go
to one of his friends',

18:28.400 --> 18:31.260
and he didn't say, "No, it's fine,
bring him with you." So...

18:31.320 --> 18:33.960
I'm...yeah, assuming it's just you
and me.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.200
So...

18:40.840 --> 18:42.580
..he rang you, his auntie.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.180
He didn't ring me, his mother.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.300
Well, he rang on the house line.
When he knows I'm at work.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.820
You work shifts, Catherine.
You could've been here.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.640
Why tea tomorrow?

18:53.000 --> 18:56.220
I don't know. Maybe him and Lucy
have got some news.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.360
He's invited Richard and Ros
as well.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.620
Oh.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.460
What news?

19:03.520 --> 19:06.660
Is Lucy pregnant?
You know as much I do.

19:06.720 --> 19:09.300
Oh, well, that'd be...
You mean you didn't ask?

19:09.360 --> 19:10.940
No. I'm not a copper.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.460
He'd have told me over the phone
if he'd wanted me to know.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.920
They probably want to make
an announcement.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.200
So you think that is what it is.
I don't know!

19:23.320 --> 19:24.720
Have you got any fags?

19:27.120 --> 19:29.180
Couldn't believe how much gear
they were carrying.

19:29.240 --> 19:33.140
And a bit of everything - coke,
heroin, M-Cat, cannabis, crystal,
E's.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.940
He'd got over 3,000 quid in his
pockets.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.960
There's no wonder he didn't want
copping.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.320
D'you know what...really...

19:42.200 --> 19:43.240
..annoys me.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.420
I rang ahead,
I flagged it up to the drugs squad,

19:46.480 --> 19:48.460
I said d'you want to talk to these
lads first? Yes, they did.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.700
I said I wanted Twiggy and Shafiq
sitting in on the interviews

19:50.760 --> 19:53.020
once they got 'em to Halifax.
Fine, no problem.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.860
Course, it's all "no comment, no
comment, no comment."

19:55.920 --> 19:59.220
So that's it for us at our level.
We never get any closer.

19:59.280 --> 20:01.660
We never get any higher
up the food chain.

20:01.720 --> 20:04.820
Any intelligence they have - drugs
squad - about where all this stuff's
coming from,

20:04.880 --> 20:07.780
how it's getting here,
I never get to hear about it.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.420
I just get to mop up the mess
at the bottom end.

20:10.480 --> 20:12.980
And we should know. I should know.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.620
If they know stuff about
people on my patch,

20:15.680 --> 20:18.820
people bringing stuff into this
valley, I should damn well know
about it.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.340
Well, why wouldn't they let you
know?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.540
Oh, they'll have some
covert surveillance stuff going on

20:22.600 --> 20:24.540
that numpties like me aren't allowed
to know about.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.280
In case you tell your sister?
Till they need a bit of back-up.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.500
Exactly.

20:29.560 --> 20:32.940
And she leaks it to her
contacts in the media.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.760
Which you would. Inevitably.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.420
It's either that or they don't
actually know any more than I do.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.960
Which is even more worrying.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.320
At least it's taken your mind off
that other business.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.820
I printed a photo of the little...

20:53.880 --> 20:56.520
shit off the box
and I went in to Chinese.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.300
Say that again slower.

21:00.360 --> 21:04.140
Mickey Yip runs it.
D'you remember Mickey Yip?

21:04.200 --> 21:06.880
He used to be in the year between us
at school.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.760
Well, you know my opinion.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.420
Ooh!

21:18.480 --> 21:20.080
What? I forgot.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.460
Hello.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.820
'Hello, it's me.' I know.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.660
Do you know a Kevin Weatherill?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.820
He lives next-door-but-three
to you and Ros, drives a BMW.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.700
'Kevin? Yeah.'

21:43.760 --> 21:45.220
What's he like?

21:45.280 --> 21:49.820
'Oh, very nice.
Ordinary. Quiet. Two girls.'

21:49.880 --> 21:54.380
She's in the early stages of
multiple sclerosis, Jenny, his wife.

21:54.440 --> 21:57.500
Walks with a stick...
sometimes a wheelchair.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.900
But, yeah, no...

21:59.960 --> 22:03.320
He's an accountant.
He works for Nevison Gallagher.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.340
OK. 'Why?'

22:06.400 --> 22:09.420
Is there any...
problems that you know of?

22:09.480 --> 22:12.220
Not that I'm aware of. Why?

22:12.280 --> 22:14.100
'No reason.' Is that...?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.880
Oh, yeah, thanks.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.940
Is Lucy pregnant?

22:20.000 --> 22:21.840
Ha-ha! I wondered that.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.940
Hi.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.160
Hi.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.220
Did you have a nice day?

22:37.280 --> 22:38.900
Yeah.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.860
Did you see that?

22:50.360 --> 22:51.520
The weirdest thing.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.900
What?

22:53.960 --> 22:56.860
It's, er...you can't mention it,
not to anyone.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.800
OK.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.040
Nevison's...like I've never seen him,
all over the place. And...

23:05.200 --> 23:06.220
God.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.480
What?

23:09.160 --> 23:10.400
Someone's taken Ann.

23:11.880 --> 23:13.260
Taken?

23:13.320 --> 23:15.340
Abducted. Kidnapped.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.580
They rang him, on her phone,

23:17.640 --> 23:20.660
this morning, mid-morning, saying
they wanted a million pounds in cash.

23:20.720 --> 23:25.960
Has he been to the police?
No! God, no! These people...

23:27.400 --> 23:30.160
The thing is, the thing I didn't
know...

23:31.360 --> 23:32.400
Helen's ill.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.720
Really ill. I mean...liver cancer.

23:37.360 --> 23:38.960
She's dying, she's...

23:40.480 --> 23:42.520
Oh, my God!

23:44.840 --> 23:45.920
When did...?

23:49.440 --> 23:51.300
He should go to the police!

23:51.360 --> 23:53.180
No. That's... He should because

23:53.240 --> 23:54.540
they'll know how to deal with it.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.740
Well, that's easy to say!
But can you imagine?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.380
If it was one of these two?

23:58.440 --> 24:00.900
These people don't
mess about, Jenny!

24:00.960 --> 24:04.140
If he steps out of line,
they're threatening to...

24:04.200 --> 24:06.560
do things to her and...

24:07.680 --> 24:08.800
Jesus.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.460
That's...

24:12.520 --> 24:13.880
Well, it's...

24:21.480 --> 24:24.760
Oh, um, Ashley rang,
you know, from the farm.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.100
Ashley?

24:27.160 --> 24:30.940
Yeah, just something to do with
the rental on the site.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.520
He said can you ring him when you
got in.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.220
'Hello?'

24:43.280 --> 24:45.580
Have you changed your mind about me
ringing you, then?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.060
'How's Nev?'

24:47.120 --> 24:48.380
How would you expect him to be?

24:48.440 --> 24:49.460
'Hey, calm down, pal.'

24:49.520 --> 24:50.560
It's your party.

24:51.560 --> 24:53.860
Is he getting this cash together,
then, or what?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.340
'What is all this shit'

24:55.400 --> 24:59.220
about a million. I specifically said
don't ask for any more than 500,000.

24:59.280 --> 25:03.140
It were you, insisting you had to
have a hundred grand.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.780
I told you, I've got overheads.
I've got expenses.

25:05.840 --> 25:08.140
'Say you'll accept less
next time you ring him.'

25:08.200 --> 25:09.620
Sure.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.980
I mean it.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.100
'OK.' I'm serious.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.080
You're the boss.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.180
So what did you want?

25:18.240 --> 25:21.180
I wanted to know
he was getting on with it

25:21.240 --> 25:23.900
and that he hadn't been
anywhere near the police.

25:23.960 --> 25:27.460
'No, he won't,
he wants her back all in one piece.'

25:27.520 --> 25:29.100
Good.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.180
Well, he needs to buckle down
and get on with it, then.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.420
You're not going to hurt her.

25:34.480 --> 25:37.540
'I'm not, no.
But I can't vouch for my lads.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.140
'Cooped up with her all day.

25:39.200 --> 25:42.380
'Eh? Getting little ideas
in their little heads.'

25:42.440 --> 25:44.020
What are you talking about?

25:44.080 --> 25:46.260
Tommy's just got out of prison.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.900
Poor lad hasn't had his leg over
in eight years.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.540
'Use your imagination.'

25:50.600 --> 25:52.500
You'll tell them not to touch her!

25:52.560 --> 25:54.740
You'll get the money,
just tell him you'll take less!

25:54.800 --> 25:56.900
'Right.' I mean it!

25:56.960 --> 25:58.740
'Yeah, you said.'

26:30.840 --> 26:32.240
I did this stupid thing.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.820
Tommy!

26:41.880 --> 26:43.200
Son.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.960
I want you to do something for me.

26:51.560 --> 26:53.060
You've got to go to the police.

26:53.120 --> 26:55.480
I know. Except...

26:56.560 --> 26:57.600
..I can't.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.220
Do you know where they're keeping
her?

27:00.280 --> 27:02.260
No! No. I know nothing. I...

27:02.320 --> 27:03.780
They...

27:03.840 --> 27:07.240
I don't think they're even going to
give me any money at the end of it.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.500
I think I've just been...shafted,
and used, and taken for a ride

27:11.560 --> 27:13.540
and I don't even know why I did it!

27:13.600 --> 27:14.860
Just...

27:14.920 --> 27:17.020
I was so angry at Nevison.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.260
Then he turns around
and tells me Helen's got cancer

27:19.320 --> 27:21.360
and he offers me more money! Jesus.

27:24.200 --> 27:25.540
Do you think they'll hurt her?

27:25.600 --> 27:26.800
No.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.100
No.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.380
He's doing it for the money.

27:31.440 --> 27:32.880
He's not doing it to hurt her.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.220
So...

27:38.280 --> 27:39.640
So we...

27:41.120 --> 27:43.940
..know that she's safe.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.660
Ish.

27:45.720 --> 27:48.980
I mean, even if she doesn't,
and even if her parents don't,

27:49.040 --> 27:51.700
we know that Ashley wouldn't...

27:51.760 --> 27:53.340
Yeah...do anything...

27:53.400 --> 27:55.180
Yeah. Yeah, we know that. Yeah.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.200
So is there anything...

27:58.360 --> 28:00.820
Was this all verbal?
Between you and Ashley.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.500
There's no emails, no...

28:02.560 --> 28:04.820
I phoned him this morning, and just
now.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.460
Phone calls are traceable.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.060
But not the content, not what you
say.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.860
No. No.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.320
I don't know, I don't think so.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.500
So...

28:16.560 --> 28:19.240
you could just deny everything.

28:21.080 --> 28:23.020
You deny putting the idea
in his head.

28:23.080 --> 28:26.540
You say that none of those
conversations ever happened.

28:26.600 --> 28:27.960
That it was all him.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.460
I mean, if it becomes necessary.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.220
If they get caught. Which they will.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.380
Which is why you mustn't
go anywhere near that money.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.620
Even if it looks like
they've got away with it.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.460
Cos they won't.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.920
In the end.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.960
People like that never do.

28:50.200 --> 28:51.780
Night-night, love. Night-night.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.620
Is Granny going to come in and kiss
me?

28:53.680 --> 28:55.160
I'll ask her.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.220
Y'all right?

29:04.280 --> 29:07.100
Too old to be getting knocked about
by scrotes.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.360
You love it. You know you do. Mmm.

29:10.720 --> 29:13.540
Promise me you'll not let
that bastard get to you.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.560
I won't let that bastard get to me.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.820
Ryan says will you go up
and give him a kiss?

29:18.880 --> 29:19.920
Yup.

29:33.640 --> 29:34.900
You can go now.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.420
What?

30:13.480 --> 30:15.060
We can't leave her in that cellar
all night.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.400
She'll freeze. She'll be reet.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.360
I gave her her knickers back.

30:22.480 --> 30:25.360
I think it might be best
we leave it that way from now on.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.120
Have you heard?

30:31.280 --> 30:32.940
You can go home now.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.500
I'm putting her in that bedroom.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.900
She can sleep in that sleeping bag.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.460
Leave her. I ain't taking orders

30:37.520 --> 30:39.040
from a screwhead like you.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.000
Ashley wants me
to take a photo of her.

30:47.520 --> 30:48.940
In the cellar.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.460
Not looking like she's having
a right lot in the way of fun.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.580
OK? I can do that.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.780
Yeah, but he asked me. So...

30:54.840 --> 30:57.340
Right. Well, do it, then.
Then I'm putting her in that bedroom

30:57.400 --> 30:58.860
and I'm giving her
that sleeping bag.

30:58.920 --> 31:00.140
I'll do it when I'm ready.

31:00.200 --> 31:01.780
You're not hurting her.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.420
That was never the plan.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.980
Do you know something, Lewis?

31:05.040 --> 31:07.000
I don't think you're cut out
for this.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.500
First off you blab, in front of her.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.440
"Ashley up at farm."

31:13.640 --> 31:15.340
And now you want to put her upstairs,

31:15.400 --> 31:18.080
where people are more likely
to see her.

31:20.640 --> 31:21.940
What's wrong with you?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.080
What's wrong with me?
You're the one that...

31:28.200 --> 31:31.200
Why don't you just get yourself
a girlfriend, like normal people?

31:32.280 --> 31:33.720
What's up, Lewis?

31:34.840 --> 31:36.900
Are you jealous? Jealous?!

31:36.960 --> 31:40.020
You... You're just...
You're not even...

31:40.080 --> 31:41.800
And you think I have no idea?

31:42.960 --> 31:45.860
Do you think when she gets out of
this she's going to let you get
away with

31:45.920 --> 31:48.340
whatever it is you think you've been
doing to her?

31:48.400 --> 31:50.260
Do you think her dad is?

31:50.320 --> 31:51.640
Maybe she won't get out of it.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.420
Now what are you bloody saying?

31:54.480 --> 31:57.820
I think once the cash's
been handed over,

31:57.880 --> 31:59.520
the safest thing would be to...

32:03.160 --> 32:06.220
That isn't... That was never...
It's your fault.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.260
Blabbing. She never heard that!

32:07.320 --> 32:08.740
She might've done. You don't know.
She didn't.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.460
Take the photo, take the stupid
photo and go.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.460
I'll look after her.
No, you'll put her in the bedroom.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.820
I'm not leaving her on her own
with you, you weirdo!

32:15.880 --> 32:18.780
I won't put her in a bedroom.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.820
I might give her the sleeping bag,
but I won't put her in a bedroom.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.740
Ashley wants you.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.700
I'm not leaving you
on your own with her.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.160
I don't care what Ashley wants.

32:42.360 --> 32:43.520
Right.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.940
We need a picture now,
for your daddy.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.860
We're going to send it to your daddy

33:10.920 --> 33:13.640
so he can see how much fun
you're having with us.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.000
So...smile!

33:21.600 --> 33:24.020
One more for luck. Yeah?

33:24.080 --> 33:26.140
One more with my hand up your fanny.

33:26.200 --> 33:27.460
Leave her alone!

33:46.120 --> 33:47.940
Anything else to say?

33:48.000 --> 33:49.600
Little shitty pants.

35:05.640 --> 35:06.940
Marcus.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.280
Catherine.

35:09.240 --> 35:10.820
Ooh, been in the wars?

35:10.880 --> 35:12.780
What happened?
Went straight into the back of her.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.220
Couldn't stop in time.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.940
She must have slammed her brakes on,
everyone's piled in behind.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.060
My constable radio'd me to say
she'd asked you to take

35:19.120 --> 35:21.540
a breathalyser test
and you weren't right keen.

35:21.600 --> 35:23.780
Is there a reason for that?

35:23.840 --> 35:25.900
Ah, come on. It's quarter past eight
in the morning,

35:25.960 --> 35:28.180
I'm not going to stand here looking
like I've had vodka for breakfast.

35:28.240 --> 35:31.620
People know who I am. She wasn't
doing it to make you look bad - it's
routine

35:31.680 --> 35:33.740
when there's been a smash.

35:33.800 --> 35:36.220
She'd have asked you even if she
hadn't smelled alcohol on your
breath.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.500
OK, look. I had a late night.

35:38.560 --> 35:39.920
Last night.

35:41.480 --> 35:42.520
I, er...

35:44.160 --> 35:45.300
I wasn't at home.

35:45.360 --> 35:47.540
So I haven't had time to shower,
get changed.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.020
So admittedly it may be on my breath,

35:49.080 --> 35:51.140
but I'm certainly not over the limit.
So you thought

35:51.200 --> 35:53.340
calling her a stupid little effing
something-beginning-with-C

35:53.400 --> 35:55.020
would help?
She threatened to arrest me.

35:55.080 --> 35:56.340
She was doing her job.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.740
She risks her neck every day,

35:58.800 --> 36:01.540
all of my officers do,
dealing with scum and tossers.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.820
What none of 'em need is abuse

36:02.880 --> 36:05.500
from someone on the council who
above all people should know better.

36:05.560 --> 36:08.380
Yes, yes. I know and I'm sorry.
Obviously,

36:08.440 --> 36:11.820
it had... It had just happened,
I was upset,

36:11.880 --> 36:13.180
I was shaken.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.340
I'd like you to blow into the tube.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.580
If you refuse again,
I'll arrest you.

36:17.640 --> 36:19.340
OK. Look.

36:19.400 --> 36:21.180
I'm more than happy to apologise
to her.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.740
Really, I am. Good.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.620
Well, you can do that
as soon as you've done this.

36:24.680 --> 36:25.900
Catherine, come on.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.540
You know I've got the highest respect
for you and your team.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.580
I'm amazed you're making a fuss
like this.

36:30.640 --> 36:31.860
Can you blow into the tube, please?

36:31.920 --> 36:34.740
It wasn't me who caused the accident!
It was the woman at the front.

36:34.800 --> 36:35.820
She's been breathalysed.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.800
She didn't have a problem with it.
And the cause remains to be
established.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.740
I'm not standing here and being
humiliated and compromised like this.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.820
OK. Then I'm going to have to ask
you to give me the keys
to your vehicle.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.100
Oh! You'll understand
that I can't let you

36:49.160 --> 36:52.220
drive away from the scene if you're
refusing to be breathalysed.

36:52.280 --> 36:55.780
I have to say,
I never had you down as a jobsworth.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.360
Keys are in the ignition.

37:04.520 --> 37:07.380
And I'm only refusing on principle.

37:07.440 --> 37:10.020
I want you to understand that
and I want it noted down.

37:10.080 --> 37:12.900
You're refusing because you've been
drinking. You and me both know that.

37:12.960 --> 37:14.260
I have to say, Catherine,

37:14.320 --> 37:16.640
I'm very disappointed
in this attitude you're taking.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.480
Can you explain to me what this is?

37:38.520 --> 37:39.820
I've no idea.

37:39.880 --> 37:42.260
Well, it looks like a little packet
of white powder to me.

37:42.320 --> 37:44.280
Well, it's not mine.
Well, it's in your vehicle.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.720
Jesus! Y...

37:48.720 --> 37:51.860
You've just put that there.
You've just planted that there.

37:51.920 --> 37:54.700
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of drunk driving

37:54.760 --> 37:56.780
and possessing an illegal substance.

37:56.840 --> 37:58.940
It's not mine!
It's got nowt to do with me!

37:59.000 --> 38:01.260
You don't have to say anything,
but it may... Can you turn round?

38:01.320 --> 38:03.900
Hands on the roof of your vehicle.
Don't do this.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.500
This is going to have consequences,

38:05.560 --> 38:06.660
and not for me.

38:06.720 --> 38:09.420
Catherine, it's ridiculous!
It's humiliating!

38:09.480 --> 38:11.540
You're making a big mistake.

38:11.600 --> 38:12.940
Have you got any other substances
on you?

38:13.000 --> 38:14.620
No, don't be ridiculous!

38:14.680 --> 38:16.540
Look, it's a plant.

38:16.600 --> 38:20.500
It was planted. All right,
maybe not by you, but it was planted.

38:20.560 --> 38:24.740
You're going to regret this, you're
going to regret it a lot, and soon,

38:24.800 --> 38:26.620
and for the rest of your life,
you understand?

38:26.680 --> 38:28.900
You're going to lose your job
over this, and worse.

38:28.960 --> 38:31.200
Much worse.
OK, hands behind your back.

38:33.240 --> 38:37.060
I'm not your mother. You've gotta
remember that nobody
is above the law.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.340
However important
they try and tell you that they are,

38:39.400 --> 38:40.900
however much they try and bully you

38:40.960 --> 38:43.340
into thinking that you've got
the wrong end of stick,

38:43.400 --> 38:46.240
nobody bullies you -
you're a police officer.

38:49.440 --> 38:52.680
This is all I've ever wanted to do...
all my life...

38:54.440 --> 38:55.760
..and I'm shit at it.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.400
Go on, off you go.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.600
You can go.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.780
Hello?

40:33.840 --> 40:35.540
'Y'all right, Nev?'

40:35.600 --> 40:37.180
Where is she?

40:37.240 --> 40:41.020
She's fine. She's lovely. She's
spent a very comfortable night.

40:41.080 --> 40:42.660
'Let's keep it that way, eh?'

40:42.720 --> 40:45.700
Is she? Has she? 'So, tomorrow.'

40:45.760 --> 40:48.260
McDonald's drive-thru
just off Huddersfield ring road.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.860
'I want to speak to her.'

40:49.920 --> 40:52.220
Let's see how we get on
tomorrow first, Nev, eh?

40:52.280 --> 40:54.000
Then we'll see about
letting you speak to her.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.740
We'd like an initial instalment.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.980
By way of showing willing.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.540
20 grand.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.820
'Cash, obviously.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.540
'And I don't want you dropping it.'

41:06.600 --> 41:09.780
I want that irritating little twat
of an accountant you've got.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.100
Me? Yes.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.020
Me?

41:14.080 --> 41:15.060
Yes.

41:15.120 --> 41:18.600
No. I... All you have to do is
drop it in a bin.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.620
Marcus Gascoigne?
It's priceless, innit?

41:24.680 --> 41:26.620
Marcus Ga...!

41:26.680 --> 41:28.540
Didn't you...have him once?

41:28.600 --> 41:30.200
No... No! God, no.

41:31.400 --> 41:32.680
Well, just that once.

41:33.960 --> 41:36.420
You know...the scrotes,
the dropouts,

41:36.480 --> 41:39.020
the numpties with nothing going on
in their lives, you can...

41:39.080 --> 41:42.460
not condone it, but you can more
easily see it, get it,
understand it, almost.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.540
But someone like him,
apart from the hypocrisy...

41:44.600 --> 41:46.900
Yeah, well,
it takes all sorts, doesn't it?

41:46.960 --> 41:49.300
No, I didn't mean you.
I wasn't thinking about you.

41:49.360 --> 41:52.240
You just... got in with the wrong
crowd, didn't you?

41:54.240 --> 41:56.940
Well, it sounds like he's blown it
as regards being a councillor

41:57.000 --> 41:58.860
when all this comes out.
You're joking!

41:58.920 --> 42:02.340
He'll get some smartarse lawyer
to tidy it all up for him,

42:02.400 --> 42:04.740
to spin it, to twist it,
the Teflon twat.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.700
Nothing'll stick. You watch.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.780
Did you have to hand him over
to drug squad?

42:08.840 --> 42:12.400
Oh, yeah. First dabs, every time.
I just tidy the streets, me.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.140
Hiya!

42:21.200 --> 42:22.940
Catherine, what have you done
to your face?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.500
Oh, it's work.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.140
How are you? Really well.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.380
Ooh, looks sore. Hiya, Clare.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.720
Hiya, love.

42:31.200 --> 42:35.460
Er, his friend he were going to,
he's got a sore throat, so we...

42:35.520 --> 42:37.340
got blown out at the last minute.

42:37.400 --> 42:39.220
I brung you some chocolate.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.780
Brought.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.800
Come on in.

42:45.400 --> 42:48.220
Mum! Hi. Hello. Hiya, Ros.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.140
Oh, good Lord,
what have you done to your eye?

42:50.200 --> 42:52.580
Oh, it's work. How are you?

42:52.640 --> 42:56.180
Good. Good. Er, I've brought Ryan.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.100
He was going to a friend's, only
they cried off at the last minute,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.860
cos he's got a bug,
his friend has, so...

43:01.920 --> 43:03.840
Ryan brought me some chocolates.

43:08.520 --> 43:10.820
The thing is, this house,

43:10.880 --> 43:13.500
it's the sort that just doesn't come
on the market very often.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.540
So, if we didn't go for it now,
we might not get the chance again.

43:16.600 --> 43:19.740
Which would be fine,
if I wasn't being made redundant.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.420
When did you find this out?
Last week.

43:21.480 --> 43:24.860
The thing is, they're going to still
need journalists.

43:24.920 --> 43:28.580
It's going online, which is fair
enough, but they still need stories.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.540
We have to reapply.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.300
They need exactly half
the number of us, so...

43:32.360 --> 43:35.300
You're assuming that you won't be
one of the ones they want back,
which is...

43:35.360 --> 43:37.500
That's not entirely the point, is it?

43:37.560 --> 43:41.060
The point is, half of us might be
taken back on, half of us won't.

43:41.120 --> 43:42.660
I wouldn't want to be in either
position.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.420
I'd rather walk away having made my
feelings about the damned thing
plain.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.220
Well, that's just cutting off your
nose to spite your face.

43:48.280 --> 43:50.860
Well, you may choose
to see it that way, but the point is,

43:50.920 --> 43:54.020
either way, it's certainly not a good
time to be getting a bigger mortgage.

43:54.080 --> 43:55.100
On a...

43:55.160 --> 43:56.780
..on a lighter note... Sorry, Dad.

43:56.840 --> 43:58.380
Um...

43:58.440 --> 43:59.940
The reason we've got you all round

44:00.000 --> 44:03.660
is cos we've got some kind of
more happy news for you.

44:03.720 --> 44:05.700
Um....

44:05.760 --> 44:07.140
Lucy...

44:07.200 --> 44:09.700
Well, we're, um...

44:09.760 --> 44:12.920
She-she's pregnant.
We're having a baby.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.820
Oh, my God!

44:17.880 --> 44:20.420
Catherine!
No, that's... That's...wonderful.

44:20.480 --> 44:23.260
That is wonderful. That is really...

44:23.320 --> 44:25.460
You're crying. I'm happy!

44:25.520 --> 44:26.620
Aw!

44:26.680 --> 44:29.580
And how...how...?
How many weeks? 12.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.980
We thought we'd wait till,
you know...

44:32.040 --> 44:34.460
Ohh! And...and are you...?
I'm fine.

44:34.520 --> 44:38.900
I felt a bit sick once or twice.
Think that's how I knew. Um...

44:38.960 --> 44:43.340
Then I went off coffee and red wine,
which made me think, "Ooh, hello!"

44:43.400 --> 44:44.780
Congratulations.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.840
Oh, no! You're going to be
grandparents!

44:48.680 --> 44:51.600
Well, we're already grandparents.

44:55.000 --> 44:57.660
What are you doing about work?
Have you decided?

44:57.720 --> 45:02.080
Well, obviously,
I don't want to give my job up, so...

45:06.760 --> 45:10.200
"Ho Ho for the robbers
The cops and the robbers Ho Ho!

45:13.080 --> 45:15.660
"And the toys?
Oh, they were taken back

45:15.720 --> 45:18.780
"By a Santa Claus copper
with a Santa Claus sack

45:18.840 --> 45:21.660
"While the rest of the force
searched day and night

45:21.720 --> 45:24.420
"For an elderly lady
of medium height

45:24.480 --> 45:27.700
"With a fondness for earrings
and red fox furs

45:27.760 --> 45:31.100
"And a habit of taking
what wasn't hers

45:31.160 --> 45:33.660
"She usually carried a sizeable bag

45:33.720 --> 45:37.540
"Her name, of course,
was Grandma Swagg

45:37.600 --> 45:40.960
"Ho Ho for the robbers
The cops and the robbers Ho Ho!"

45:43.560 --> 45:45.620
Granny. Yes, chick?

45:45.680 --> 45:47.600
Is that Richard my grandad?

45:51.240 --> 45:53.780
He...he used to be my husband.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.780
So, yeah. He...

45:55.840 --> 45:58.360
Technically.
And he was your mum's dad, so, yeah.

46:00.200 --> 46:02.960
Yes, he is your grandad.
Can I go and see him?

46:06.000 --> 46:08.520
Would you like to?
Where does he live?

46:10.480 --> 46:13.740
On towards Ripponden.
Can you drive me over?

46:13.800 --> 46:17.320
Like, one Saturday morning.
Then he could play football with me.

46:20.400 --> 46:22.440
Well, we'll have...
we'll have to see.

46:57.080 --> 46:58.500
Hello?

46:58.560 --> 47:00.080
'Kevin, it's Ashley.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.420
'You do realise
you don't really have to drive

47:04.480 --> 47:06.920
'to McDonald's off Huddersfield
ring road, don't you?'

47:17.000 --> 47:19.100
She's all right.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.820
Ann.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.240
Isn't she? She's fine.

47:31.960 --> 47:33.600
She's absolutely fine.

47:38.280 --> 47:40.680
There you go. That's yours.

48:22.680 --> 48:24.300
Hello. Is he in?

48:24.360 --> 48:27.100
Yeah! Come in.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.220
I was just passing, I was, er...

48:29.280 --> 48:31.700
He's just getting changed,
I'll give him a shout.

48:31.760 --> 48:33.000
Richard!

48:34.000 --> 48:38.200
Can I make you a cup of tea? No.
Thank you.

48:40.680 --> 48:42.620
I meant to say...about yesterday.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.980
I'm sorry that I put my foot in it.
It's fine.

48:46.040 --> 48:48.520
I said it without even thinking.
It's fine.

48:50.280 --> 48:52.120
Hi. Hi.

48:53.800 --> 48:56.760
Have you got five minutes? Sure.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.880
It's delicate. Can I...?
Yeah, course.

49:02.280 --> 49:05.300
D'you want me to
leave you on your own?

49:05.360 --> 49:06.560
No, no, no, er...

49:08.000 --> 49:09.560
OK, erm...

49:11.800 --> 49:15.280
So yesterday, after yesterday,
last night...

49:17.280 --> 49:21.380
...Ryan asked me if you're
his grandad and, erm, I...

49:21.440 --> 49:23.060
I couldn't...

49:23.120 --> 49:27.980
I said you used to be my husband
and you were his mum's dad

49:28.040 --> 49:32.600
and I said... I said yeah, yeah,
you are his grandad.

49:33.800 --> 49:34.840
But the thing...

49:41.360 --> 49:43.540
No, I'm sorry. I am sorry.

49:43.600 --> 49:45.740
I know I made this decision,
and I know you didn't,

49:45.800 --> 49:47.220
and I've brought it all on myself,

49:47.280 --> 49:49.680
and I've got no right to ask you
this, but I'm going to.

49:54.080 --> 49:55.640
He...

49:57.440 --> 49:58.800
He asked me...

50:01.400 --> 50:06.960
..if I would drive him over here
one day, one Saturday...

50:08.600 --> 50:10.840
..so you that you could play
football with him.

50:12.240 --> 50:14.220
Cos it doesn't occur to him

50:14.280 --> 50:17.860
that...that you being his grandad
wouldn't want to do that,

50:17.920 --> 50:19.560
wouldn't want to play with him.

50:28.520 --> 50:30.000
I'm not his grandad.

50:34.080 --> 50:35.520
You shouldn't have told him that.

50:41.480 --> 50:44.360
OK. Fair enough.

50:46.960 --> 50:50.860
Except, you know, you are. Don't.

50:50.920 --> 50:55.700
You know, I don't...I don't get
the way you can think...

50:55.760 --> 50:58.500
I'm not going through all this. If
I'd decided to wash my hands of him,

50:58.560 --> 51:00.060
he'd have ended up in care.
You made that decision.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.860
Our daughter's child
would've ended up

51:01.920 --> 51:03.460
in care. She never wanted him!

51:03.520 --> 51:05.500
It's still her flesh and blood!
She was raped!

51:05.560 --> 51:07.300
Our flesh and...
She killed herself because of him!

51:07.360 --> 51:10.500
She killed herself because she'd
been raped not because of him!

51:10.560 --> 51:11.700
It's the same thing! It isn't!

51:11.760 --> 51:14.380
It isn't. He was there to remind
her every day.

51:14.440 --> 51:16.880
That's why she...
That is not his fault!

51:19.640 --> 51:20.680
I can't look at him.

51:22.880 --> 51:24.560
I realise it was a big ask.

52:23.120 --> 52:24.340
Hello.

52:24.400 --> 52:26.900
Oh, hi. How are you?

52:26.960 --> 52:28.140
Kevin, is it?

52:28.200 --> 52:31.940
Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.
You left abruptly.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.100
Everything all right?

52:34.160 --> 52:36.140
Yes. Yeah.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.220
You never finished telling me
your story.

52:38.280 --> 52:42.660
Oh, I changed my mind. It wasn't...
really a police matter.

52:42.720 --> 52:44.860
OK.

52:44.920 --> 52:48.880
Well, if, er, there's anything
I can do. Sure.

52:52.280 --> 52:53.460
Hello?

52:53.520 --> 52:54.580
'Is that Catherine?'

52:54.640 --> 52:55.700
Yeah.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.900
It's Mickey from the Curry House
up Rawson Lane.

52:57.960 --> 53:00.060
That fella you were looking for's
been in.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.700
'Just now.

53:01.760 --> 53:04.380
'I came outside for a smoke when he
left so I could keep an eye on him,

53:04.440 --> 53:06.980
'and I saw where he went.
I saw which house he went in.'

53:07.040 --> 53:08.220
I've got to go.

53:08.280 --> 53:09.640
I'll be with you in five minutes.

54:55.040 --> 54:56.640
Answer the phone, you twat!

55:00.520 --> 55:03.140
'Hello.' Ashley, it's Tommy.

55:03.200 --> 55:06.380
Why have I just had bastard
police knocking on door?

55:06.440 --> 55:07.700
'What are you talking about?'

55:07.760 --> 55:10.300
Some slag of a policewoman
knocking on this door!

55:10.360 --> 55:12.180
When? 'Now! Just now!'

55:12.240 --> 55:18.280
Just don't...don't...don't do
anything, don't panic, I'll...
Has she gone?

55:20.160 --> 55:21.580
Yeah.

55:21.640 --> 55:24.580
I'll send Lewis...with the van.

55:24.640 --> 55:26.420
Just get her ready, we'll move her.

55:26.480 --> 55:29.660
How come the police know anything?
Who's said anything?

55:29.720 --> 55:31.140
'Nothing, nobody.'

55:31.200 --> 55:33.620
Just get her ready to shift her.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.240
All right?

55:43.960 --> 55:47.420
I'm not... I'm not going there.
Do it!

55:47.480 --> 55:48.800
D'you want that money?

55:52.080 --> 55:53.480
I'll get keys.

55:55.880 --> 55:58.140
Where are we taking her?
I don't know yet.

55:58.200 --> 56:00.160
Just ring me
as soon as you're on the move.

56:13.760 --> 56:14.740
Hello?

56:14.800 --> 56:17.660
Why've I got police knocking
on my door down Milton Avenue?

56:17.720 --> 56:19.500
'Where?'

56:19.560 --> 56:22.820
The house where I'm keeping her.
I've got police knocking on it.

56:22.880 --> 56:27.100
'Has Nevison been to the police?'
No! No, not...not to my...

56:27.160 --> 56:29.580
No, he hasn't. Not to my...

56:29.640 --> 56:31.300
Well, then, why are they knocking
on the door, then?

56:31.360 --> 56:33.100
What do they know?
'I've got absolutely'

56:33.160 --> 56:34.140
no idea.
