WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.306
- Previous on Nashville...

00:02.350 --> 00:04.004
- I ended it with Jonah,

00:04.047 --> 00:06.310
- He'’s had six settlements
with ex-employees.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.095
- I might be falling for you.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.792
- Is there something
I'’m missing here?

00:09.835 --> 00:12.186
- We met at the absolute
perfect wrong time.

00:12.229 --> 00:13.796
- Alannah, don'’t.

00:13.839 --> 00:16.277
- I'’m pregnant.
- And you haven'’t told him.

00:16.320 --> 00:18.757
- It'’s 104!

00:18.801 --> 00:20.672
- I'’ve got this, honey.

00:20.716 --> 00:22.370
It'’s not what you think, I--

00:22.413 --> 00:23.371
- Daph, you want to
go with granddad?

00:23.414 --> 00:26.939
- Oh.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.377
- Get out of my sight.
Go!

00:38.603 --> 00:39.517
- Y'’all are up early.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.781
Want me to fix you something?

00:42.825 --> 00:43.782
- No, I'’m okay.
Thank you.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.003
- No.
It'’s not our concern anymore.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.744
- He doesn'’t have
anywhere to go!

00:48.787 --> 00:51.094
- Well, he spent his whole life
getting by on his own, okay?

00:51.138 --> 00:53.227
Believe me, that he can do.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.358
- Knock, knock!

00:54.402 --> 00:55.533
- Hey, Buck!

00:55.577 --> 00:56.752
- Morning, everybody.
- Hey.

00:56.795 --> 00:57.970
- Sorry to barge in so early.

00:58.014 --> 00:59.102
I had some news
I wanted to share.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.669
- Hope it'’s good news.

01:00.712 --> 01:02.236
- Well, I know you didn'’t
ask me to do this.

01:02.279 --> 01:04.325
But after you played
at the Opry,

01:04.368 --> 01:05.935
I started talking
to some bookers.

01:05.978 --> 01:07.937
I think we can get you
out on tour.

01:07.980 --> 01:10.679
- You.

01:10.722 --> 01:12.333
No way!

01:12.376 --> 01:14.248
- Yeah.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.379
- Pull the other leg, Buck.
It'’s got bells on it.

01:15.423 --> 01:16.772
- Deacon, I'’m totally serious.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.078
The internet'’s expanded
the audience.

01:18.121 --> 01:20.732
Old guys are
coming back in style!

01:20.776 --> 01:22.734
Seriously, though, there'’s a
lot of interest out there.

01:22.778 --> 01:24.954
- That is very kind.
I just...

01:24.997 --> 01:26.695
- Come on. What--
- I don'’t know.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.131
- This is what you'’ve
always wanted.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.437
- Yes, but...

01:32.135 --> 01:34.355
Maybe it'’s not the right time.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.618
- You have to do it!
- Okay.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.881
Let me think about it.

01:42.885 --> 01:44.278
Am I doing something wrong?

01:44.321 --> 01:45.540
- I just can'’t stop
thinking about you

01:45.583 --> 01:47.150
strutting around
onstage last night.

01:47.194 --> 01:48.499
- I knew I looked ridiculous!

01:48.543 --> 01:49.718
And you encouraged me!

01:49.761 --> 01:51.328
- No, you didn'’t
look ridiculous!

01:51.372 --> 01:53.722
In fact, it got me thinking.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.116
Are you sure this little
project of ours is done?

01:58.030 --> 01:59.989
Even if we wanted her,
Alannah'’s not coming back.

02:00.032 --> 02:02.078
- Avery might.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.602
- I'’m not begging him to come
back to the band, okay?

02:04.646 --> 02:08.171
Besides, why should I be the one
to make the first move?

02:08.215 --> 02:09.825
- Avery'’s like your brother.

02:09.868 --> 02:13.176
In fact, he'’s your
Eskimo brother.

02:17.049 --> 02:20.879
- And then there were three.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.317
Ha-ha!

02:23.360 --> 02:27.059
Come on.
Don'’t tell me y'all are nervous.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.583
So for this final round,

02:28.626 --> 02:29.845
we'’re gonna shake things up
a little bit.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.934
Each of you will be
assigned a song

02:31.977 --> 02:33.370
and you'’re gonna have
to make it work, all right?

02:33.414 --> 02:35.590
No ifs, ands or buts about it.

02:35.633 --> 02:39.898
Daphne, my sweet, this is yours.

02:39.942 --> 02:43.598
- ♪ Fight and fire
built to take a beating ♪

02:43.641 --> 02:47.471
♪ But you gotta keep
your head up high ♪

02:47.515 --> 02:50.605
♪ And wear it on your sleeve
Where everyone can see ♪

02:50.648 --> 02:54.565
♪ That you got a light
burning through that dark ♪

02:58.265 --> 03:00.136
- Oh, here we go.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.225
- Yeah. I just wanna know why
you'’ve picked that song for her.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.574
It'’s a hit.

03:03.618 --> 03:05.228
- And it'’s so not her style.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.448
It'’s mainstream commercial...
- Excuse me.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.536
Whoever wins "Nashville'’s Next"
better be able

03:08.579 --> 03:10.364
to sell a song on the radio.

03:10.407 --> 03:12.801
- You know that, if she does
that song, you'’re doing her in.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.237
- Darlin'’, I'm just
giving her a chance

03:14.281 --> 03:16.196
to sink or swim, all right?

03:20.635 --> 03:22.506
- Jessie, hey.
- Hey.

03:22.550 --> 03:23.507
- Nice to see you.

03:23.551 --> 03:24.987
What are you doing here?

03:25.030 --> 03:28.947
- Just picking up some
assignments for Daphne.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.601
- Going to
the parent-teacher conference.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.647
How'’s Jake?

03:32.690 --> 03:35.954
- He is going to Connecticut
at the end of the month.

03:35.998 --> 03:39.044
So I'’m just trying to prepare
him for that as best as I can.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.873
- I'’m sorry, Jess. That...
- I know. It'’s...

03:41.917 --> 03:43.484
He'’s gonna be fine, I'm sure.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.050
I'’m the one that's
being a baby about it.

03:45.094 --> 03:48.706
- No, you'’re not, you're not.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.273
- Well, I don'’t want to be late.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.883
- Yeah, okay, mm-hmm.
- Gotta go.

04:01.893 --> 04:03.330
- Uh-oh.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.506
A Deacon call must mean
there'’s a real problem.

04:05.549 --> 04:06.681
- Actually, I think
we might have

04:06.724 --> 04:08.117
a bit of an opportunity here.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.424
- I'’m listening.

04:10.467 --> 04:13.340
- This is all coming with me.

04:13.383 --> 04:17.344
Oh, dump it.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.563
- Knock, knock.
Special delivery.

04:19.607 --> 04:21.652
- Hi!

04:21.696 --> 04:23.785
Hi, pretty girl.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.921
- Em, you want to show Dave what
we'’re planning in the bedroom?

04:29.965 --> 04:31.271
- Of course.

04:31.314 --> 04:34.274
- Go to Auntie Em for a minute.
Thanks.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.543
- It'’s just
in the planning phase.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.415
Without even talking to me?

04:45.459 --> 04:46.416
- Listen, hold on,
and I'’ll explain.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.289
- Someone heard
my press conference

04:49.332 --> 04:51.116
and made me an offer
I couldn'’t refuse.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.511
You'’re moving away
just like that?

04:54.555 --> 04:56.339
- Listen to me.
I'’m not going far.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.559
And I'’m not running away.

04:58.602 --> 05:02.606
This farm, it has sheep,
goats, big fields.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.348
I mean, it'’s the perfect place
for a little girl to grow up.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.351
- 30 minutes outside
the city...max.

05:08.395 --> 05:11.006
We'’ll still split Cadence 50-50.

05:11.049 --> 05:12.964
We will make this work.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.531
I promise.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.634
- There'’s something
you'’re not telling me.

05:30.678 --> 05:34.943
Juliette, I know you well
enough to know that.

05:36.858 --> 05:42.385
- Look, these walls just
have too many memories.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.822
I need a new beginning.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.172
You understand that, don'’t you?

05:49.479 --> 05:50.959
- Yeah.

06:02.492 --> 06:03.319
- Well, if it'’s not
one thing, it'’s the other.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.148
- Well, it'’s Bucky this time.

06:06.191 --> 06:08.063
He swung by and said
there'’s been enough resurgence

06:08.106 --> 06:09.325
in my music that he thinks
he can put together

06:09.369 --> 06:10.935
a tour for my old ass.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.198
- There it is.

06:13.242 --> 06:16.854
This is the piece
you need to replace.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.508
Well, obviously, it'’s not
a tragedy or nothing, just...

06:18.552 --> 06:22.120
It'’s not like I can just
up and leave the girls

06:22.164 --> 06:24.384
at a time like this.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.560
Maybe when she'’s an adult.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.605
Maybe when they both move up
and out on me, I'’ll do it then.

06:28.649 --> 06:30.433
- What if the offer'’s
not there anymore?

06:30.477 --> 06:32.870
'’Cause your future in plumbing
doesn'’t look so bright.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.698
- That'’s very funny.
- Okay.

06:34.742 --> 06:37.397
I'’ve watched you back other
people up onstage my whole life.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.224
- Yeah, maybe a part of
me feels like

06:39.268 --> 06:41.009
if I was supposed to make it,
I would'’ve made it by now.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.097
- Look, if you'’re worried
about the girls,

06:42.140 --> 06:43.446
I'’ll take care of 'em.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.143
You'’ve done
so much for them and me.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.667
It'’s about dang time
you just do you.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.889
- Just the pot calling
the kettle black, that'’s all.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.021
When are you gonna
get up onstage?

06:53.064 --> 06:54.414
That'’s what I wanna know.

06:54.457 --> 06:56.416
- I literally just
sang at a fundraiser

06:56.459 --> 06:58.418
unless I was that forgettable.
- No. It was amazing.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.158
Remind me that
that'’s who you are.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.725
That'’s what you should be
doing every damn day.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.772
- Well, maybe if you do things
for yourself for once,

07:04.815 --> 07:06.991
you'’ll have some ground to stand
on to get me to do the same.

07:09.820 --> 07:13.781
- Well, hey, wow.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.044
So this is where
all the magic happens, huh?

07:16.087 --> 07:20.048
- Abracadabra.
Make yourself at home.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.050
- Yeah, it'’s quite
the little artist garret

07:22.093 --> 07:24.269
you got going on here.

07:24.313 --> 07:27.490
Almost makes me nostalgic for
when I was first coming up.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.537
- Yeah, well, then I remember
how much I like

07:30.580 --> 07:34.018
Aspen and Kobe beef.

07:34.062 --> 07:35.672
- Is that what you came
here to talk about?

07:35.716 --> 07:37.326
- No.

07:37.369 --> 07:39.720
I came here to tell you that
you are playing a gig

07:39.763 --> 07:41.722
tomorrow night
in Memphis, Tennessee.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.160
- Yeah. I'’ll come along.
I'’ll show you Graceland.

07:45.203 --> 07:49.207
- And where in this scenario
are we gonna sleep?

07:49.251 --> 07:51.383
- At the St. John!

07:51.427 --> 07:54.082
Two rooms, of course.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.824
Already booked.

07:56.867 --> 08:02.569
- ♪ All my life
I'’ve been waiting ♪

08:02.612 --> 08:09.967
♪ To light that night
that won'’t go fading ♪

08:10.011 --> 08:12.883
♪ I don'’t want to have
to think about ♪

08:12.927 --> 08:16.452
♪ How I'’m ever gonna
put it out ♪

08:16.496 --> 08:21.762
♪ I want I want to

08:27.594 --> 08:29.247
How'’s it sounding?

08:29.291 --> 08:31.511
- You know, just a little
auto-tune here, a little there.

08:31.554 --> 08:32.947
- Shut up.
- It'’s gonna be fine.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.601
Don'’t worry about it.
I'’ll fix it.

08:34.644 --> 08:36.080
I'’m kidding. I'm kidding.
It'’s perfect.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.995
You'’re perfect.
- Stop it.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.257
- You know you'’re
dangerously close

08:39.301 --> 08:40.955
to enough material
for a new EP.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.739
- Oh, yeah, I know.

08:42.783 --> 08:44.001
You'’re gonna be out there

08:44.045 --> 08:46.569
headlining your own
world tour soon.

08:46.613 --> 08:47.788
- And what are you
gonna be doing?

08:47.831 --> 08:49.267
Producing for Drake?

08:49.311 --> 08:50.965
- Actually, I was kind
of thinking

08:51.008 --> 08:52.793
that I would be
wherever you were.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.839
You know, just keeping you
company so you don'’t get lonely.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.275
If you can tolerate me.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.407
- I think I can tolerate you.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.017
That'’s perfect.

09:00.061 --> 09:02.106
Because I don'’t have
a permanent place to live.

09:07.459 --> 09:08.852
You wanna hear it?

09:08.896 --> 09:09.984
- Yeah.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.597
- My advice is
the same as always.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.773
You just gotta be true to you.
The rest will follow.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.993
- This song just
does not feel like me.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.603
- I'’m just trying to remind
you that at the end of the day

09:20.647 --> 09:21.996
there are some things
that are more important

09:22.039 --> 09:24.041
than winning a
television contest.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.827
It'’s for you.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.139
What'’s that you get there?
Secret admirer?

09:35.183 --> 09:36.488
Daphne?

09:39.187 --> 09:40.797
Hey.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.407
- He was just trying
to wish me good luck.

09:46.194 --> 09:48.936
- No, baby. He'’s trying
to manipulate you,

09:48.979 --> 09:50.633
to divide us is
what he'’s doing.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.070
- You don'’t know that.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.115
And he put your
safety at risk, so...

09:54.158 --> 09:55.420
- He wasn'’t drunk!

09:55.464 --> 09:57.118
- I'’m not having
this conversation.

09:57.161 --> 09:58.598
That'’s it.
Give it here.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.305
- So Will and I played
together the other day.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.741
- I heard you weren'’t
completely terrible.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.093
- You should come back
and play with us, too.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.182
- Oh, I don'’t know, man.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.228
I mean, things
got pretty weird.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.490
- I know. And I'’m sorry.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.883
But, look,
what I'’ve learned

10:22.926 --> 10:26.495
from this whole mess is
I find these girls

10:26.538 --> 10:29.019
and I think they'’re just
gonna solve all my problems.

10:29.063 --> 10:33.197
But really, I think it'’s just
time for me to grow out of that.

10:33.241 --> 10:35.678
- You realize we met more
than six years ago, right?

10:35.722 --> 10:37.680
You'’ve done a lot of
growing since then.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.334
- Not as much as you.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.292
- You were a total tool!

10:41.336 --> 10:42.946
- I was insecure.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.905
- All right, we were
both complete idiots.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.999
You know, whatever'’s happened,

10:52.042 --> 10:55.176
you can'’t deny we still make
great music together.

10:55.219 --> 10:56.307
- Can'’t argue with you there.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.184
- I'’ll think about it.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.536
- Feels like it'’s been forever
since one of our catch-ups.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.929
- Yeah, that'’s my fault.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.408
My life got kind of
crazy for a second.

11:10.452 --> 11:11.714
- Oh, I gathered.

11:13.411 --> 11:15.413
- Yeah, something about
an explosion with Jonah.

11:15.457 --> 11:18.155
And the other dude
in the group, Branch?

11:18.199 --> 11:20.070
- It'’s Twig.

11:20.114 --> 11:24.814
But, yeah, he'’s a good guy.
He'’s not at all like Jonah.

11:24.858 --> 11:28.600
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.081
- One question.

11:31.125 --> 11:34.345
Why don'’t you light up
when you talk about him?

11:34.389 --> 11:36.652
- I don'’t know.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.046
I think it'’s just a lot
that'’s happened at once.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.222
I didn'’t really deal with
how sad I am about Jonah.

11:41.265 --> 11:43.615
And suddenly I'’m trying to just
be happy with someone else.

11:43.659 --> 11:46.270
- Perfectly reasonable.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.750
- But he'’s so nice.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.274
And we work
really well together.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.234
And he'’s liked me
for a long time.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.149
- So...

11:55.192 --> 11:59.153
- So I feel like I need
to give him more of a chance.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.938
- Okay, listen to me.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.853
The only thing you need
to do right now

12:03.897 --> 12:05.855
is to honor
what you'’re feeling.

12:05.899 --> 12:08.118
at the moment, okay?

12:08.162 --> 12:09.772
You'’re young.

12:09.816 --> 12:11.165
Your one job is to be free
and have fun.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.122
You hear me?

12:14.081 --> 12:15.778
- Thank you.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.659
- I understand why
you made him leave.

12:27.703 --> 12:30.706
And I understand if you never
want to talk to him again.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.535
But it'’s my competition.

12:33.578 --> 12:36.625
And I get to choose
who I want to invite.

12:36.668 --> 12:38.975
So I'’m inviting him.

12:48.506 --> 12:52.119
- ♪ I don'’t know
what'’s right or wrong ♪

12:52.162 --> 12:55.862
♪ Where we go or
when we'’re gone ♪

12:55.905 --> 13:01.171
♪ But I know your touch
is worth feeling ♪

13:03.521 --> 13:06.829
♪ Whatever life throws my way

13:06.873 --> 13:11.268
♪ With every move I'’ll make ♪

13:11.312 --> 13:16.665
♪ I know your love
won'’t leave me ♪

13:16.708 --> 13:23.846
♪ Maybe every step
that we take ♪

13:23.890 --> 13:30.897
♪ Is somehow guided
by the hands of fate ♪

13:30.940 --> 13:38.774
♪ One thing I know
wherever I go ♪

13:38.818 --> 13:43.300
♪ You dwell in my soul

13:50.307 --> 13:52.919
- Yes.
- Get your butt up to Room 1520.

13:52.962 --> 13:55.399
We'’re having a party.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.227
- People you should meet.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.796
- Okay.
Give me a few minutes.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.853
- You want to talk to somebody,
you come to me.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.116
You don'’t manipulate
a 14-year-old girl!

14:16.159 --> 14:17.465
- I just wanted
to send my love.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.858
- You had your chance for that.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.120
You wanted to meet
your granddaughters.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.512
You got to live there,
but you blew it!

14:21.556 --> 14:23.297
- I didn'’t drink for 28 years!

14:23.340 --> 14:24.907
- All right, spare me, dad.

14:24.951 --> 14:27.736
- So last year when I watched
my house break apart

14:27.779 --> 14:30.608
and everything in it
wash away, I slipped!

14:30.652 --> 14:32.436
Please, son, don'’t...

14:32.480 --> 14:33.960
I'’m not trying to make
this your problem!

14:34.003 --> 14:35.831
I'’m asking you to hear me!

14:39.226 --> 14:42.533
So, yes, I slipped,

14:42.577 --> 14:44.622
but I didn'’t become
a drunk again.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.363
It was different this time.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.887
I couldn'’t sleep at night.

14:47.930 --> 14:50.019
I was shaking, so I took
a sip now and then.

14:50.063 --> 14:51.542
- Here we go.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.544
- No! It wasn'’t even
nearly every night.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.546
And I knew I had to stop.

14:55.590 --> 14:59.855
And I hoped that, if I finally
had the courage to face you

14:59.899 --> 15:03.554
and to know your girls,

15:03.598 --> 15:07.384
maybe I could find
a little peace.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.301
But it didn'’t work that way.

15:11.345 --> 15:13.956
When I saw all that
I had missed,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.177
how wonderful your girls were,

15:17.220 --> 15:18.700
it scared me even more.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.703
I was scared you
would send me away.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.184
- Of course.
My fault, right, Dad?

15:24.227 --> 15:27.404
- No, no.
- It'’s my fault again.

15:27.448 --> 15:31.582
- I'’m a very flawed man, son.
And I always will be.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.323
But that'’s not the end
of the story.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.935
When Daphne discovered me
drinking,

15:35.978 --> 15:41.375
the look on her face...
God, it destroyed me.

15:41.418 --> 15:45.640
That was it.
I haven'’t touched a drop since.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.992
- When you found
the bottle in my car,

15:50.036 --> 15:53.691
if you'’d looked at it, you would
have seen it was still sealed.

15:55.650 --> 15:56.868
Never been opened.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.438
I stopped.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.006
Now I can'’t say
I'’ll never drink.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.836
But I will never be the man
who hurt you again

16:07.879 --> 16:11.405
and I would never
hurt those girls.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.083
- There she is.
Come on in.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.867
Come on in, come on in.

16:41.609 --> 16:46.396
- Oh, well, they had to, um...
they had to pack it in.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.876
Drink?

16:47.919 --> 16:50.661
- You lured me here with
a promise of a party.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.056
- You'’re shameless.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.318
- Damn right I am.
Look at this.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.016
Look at this, look at this.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.669
You don'’t get that view
from your room, do you, huh?

16:58.713 --> 17:00.280
Isn'’t that something?

17:01.803 --> 17:04.414
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.287
- You'’re a married man,
remember?

17:07.330 --> 17:08.940
- Oh, come on.
It'’s a technicality at best.

17:08.984 --> 17:12.770
Come on.
You want this.

17:14.598 --> 17:18.689
- Yeah, just one night.
Nobody has to know.

17:18.733 --> 17:19.690
- Hey...
- Oh, hush.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.388
- Brad, stop it!

17:21.431 --> 17:22.389
- Come on, be a good girl.
Now come on.

17:22.432 --> 17:24.565
- Brad...
- Stop.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.088
- Don'’t...
- Oh, mother!

17:26.132 --> 17:28.960
Hey! Hold on! Hold on!

17:29.004 --> 17:31.093
You'’re not going anywhere 'til
I clarify something with you!

17:31.137 --> 17:34.270
Look, you knew what
you were doing! You did!

17:34.314 --> 17:36.142
You were flirting with me!
You were teasing me!

17:36.185 --> 17:37.621
You know, you know the rules!

17:37.665 --> 17:39.580
Now you and I have
been playing a game

17:39.623 --> 17:40.929
that'’s been around as long
as there'’ve been powerful men

17:40.972 --> 17:42.104
and beautiful women.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.105
You know, the man
helps the woman

17:43.149 --> 17:44.715
and the woman helps the man.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.761
There'’s an implicit contract.

17:46.804 --> 17:49.416
So, look, you either
hold up your end of the contract

17:49.459 --> 17:53.594
or you'’re in breach,
all right?

17:53.637 --> 17:55.987
The choice is entirely
up to you, honey.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.773
You'’ll never work again.

17:58.816 --> 18:02.037
For the sake of transparency.
I thought you should know.

18:11.525 --> 18:13.048
- I literally wanna die.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.876
- Now you don'’t
wanna die, sweetheart.

18:14.919 --> 18:18.053
- I have to sing this song
on national television!

18:18.097 --> 18:19.837
- Honey, I understand,
all right?

18:19.881 --> 18:21.883
You wanna solve this problem,
you just gotta break it down

18:21.926 --> 18:24.059
into little bite-sized
pieces, all right?

18:25.582 --> 18:26.975
- It means that you gotta
figure out a way,

18:27.018 --> 18:28.498
whatever the song is,
to make it yours.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.848
- This song is not me.
That'’s the problem.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.937
- Okay.
- This song is not for you.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.635
- I know.

18:34.678 --> 18:37.246
- Yeah, well, that'’s exactly
why Brad picked it.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.640
But you'’re strong and brave.

18:39.683 --> 18:41.729
And so damn talented,
you'’re gonna be fine.

18:48.170 --> 18:49.737
- I'’ve been trying
that for two days.

18:49.780 --> 18:51.260
I didn'’t get anywhere
and I'’m her father.

18:51.304 --> 18:52.957
- Well, I think we'’ve
identified the problem.

18:58.006 --> 19:02.358
- Okay, one almond milk
chai latte with cinnamon.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.186
- Thank you.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.276
- So you wanna tell me
what we'’re doing here?

19:07.320 --> 19:09.278
We'’re getting coffee.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.845
- Well, you don'’t get coffee.

19:10.888 --> 19:13.630
Adults get coffee when
they want to catch up

19:13.674 --> 19:15.632
and they haven'’t
seen each other.

19:15.676 --> 19:16.720
We see each other
like every day.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.072
- I just...

19:21.116 --> 19:22.378
I wanted to thank you.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.209
- For having the courage
to tell me the truth

19:27.253 --> 19:30.734
when no one else would, so...

19:34.173 --> 19:36.914
- Whoa.
What'’s that?

19:36.958 --> 19:42.616
- Open it.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.052
- Whoa, these are like...

19:44.095 --> 19:46.402
these are like
professional grade, dude.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.623
These are...
No, these are too nice.

19:49.666 --> 19:52.103
- Not for a professional
grade music producer.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.805
- Why do I get the feeling
that this is like

19:57.848 --> 20:00.373
some sort of sad
consolation prize?

20:02.113 --> 20:04.072
- Please just take them.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.682
- No.

20:05.726 --> 20:08.772
- I don'’t want the headphones.
I want you.

20:10.470 --> 20:14.517
- I just feel like you need
someone who can put you

20:14.561 --> 20:19.130
at the center of
their universe.

20:19.174 --> 20:21.089
And I just don'’t think
I can do that right now.

20:26.137 --> 20:31.317
- And what if I said that I want
to take you just as you are?

20:35.886 --> 20:38.019
- I would say you
deserve so much more.

20:44.634 --> 20:47.637

How'’s Juliette?

21:19.669 --> 21:22.019
- I don'’t know.
She'’s in rare form.

21:22.063 --> 21:24.021
Have you heard
she'’s selling the house

21:24.065 --> 21:25.762
and moving to the country?

21:25.806 --> 21:27.242
- My God.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.768
- Well, in spite of everything,

21:31.812 --> 21:34.902
she seems to have her head
in the right place.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.121
- I agree she'’s different.

21:37.165 --> 21:40.429
But she goes and does
something impulsive like this

21:40.473 --> 21:44.651
and then I remember why
I just can'’t be with her.

21:47.697 --> 21:52.136
What is it?

21:52.180 --> 21:54.617
- She'’s pregnant.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.663
I wasn'’t supposed
to say anything.

21:56.706 --> 21:57.925
- Oh, my God.

21:57.968 --> 21:59.579
- Before she left
the last time,

21:59.622 --> 22:02.930
she said that you
guys had been together.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.542
- She said it was
the only thing

22:06.586 --> 22:08.370
that gave her the strength
to escape.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.590
- I gotta...

22:10.633 --> 22:13.636
- Go. Go.
- Yeah.

22:18.554 --> 22:20.251
- Hey, what are
you doing here?

22:20.295 --> 22:23.559
- How could you
keep this from me?

22:25.953 --> 22:27.694
- I just wasn'’t ready yet.

22:27.737 --> 22:30.914
- Oh, I see.
And when was that gonna be?

22:30.958 --> 22:32.742
I mean, what was
the plan exactly?

22:32.786 --> 22:34.396
Did you think you'’d
move to the country

22:34.440 --> 22:36.137
and have a baby
without me noticing?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.530
- Of course not.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.401
Just you'’re not
my husband anymore.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.185
So I wasn'’t sure...

22:41.229 --> 22:43.013
- I'’m the father.
I think we'’re partners in that.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.406
I think I deserve to know!

22:44.450 --> 22:46.190
- And I was gonna tell you.

22:46.234 --> 22:50.760
I just didn'’t want to
influence you or how you felt.

22:50.804 --> 22:55.809
Avery, I love you,

22:55.852 --> 22:57.724
but I don'’t
want to trap you.

22:57.767 --> 23:02.381
I want you to come up to me
and say that you need me.

23:02.424 --> 23:05.166
And you want to spend
the rest of your life with me,

23:05.209 --> 23:08.648
not because you feel
like you have to save me,

23:08.691 --> 23:11.955
or you'’re worried about me.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.218
But because you'’re worried
about yourself without me.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.833
But you don'’t feel
that way anymore.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.926
And I will survive.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.192
- Broadcasting live
from Music City...

23:31.235 --> 23:32.976
- Daphne!

23:33.020 --> 23:34.456
- It'’s the Grand Finale
of "Nashville'’s Next"

23:34.500 --> 23:35.544
country star...
- You look so beautiful.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.633
Oh, that dress.

23:37.677 --> 23:40.157
- Okay, I literally feel
like I'’m gonna throw up.

23:42.029 --> 23:43.726
- I'’m gonna take my seat.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.820
- We'’re ready
for you now, Daphne.

23:52.648 --> 23:54.433
- Good luck.
- Go get '’em!

23:56.304 --> 23:57.784
- You know, this feels
kind of unreal for me

23:57.827 --> 23:59.220
standing up here right now.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.004
When I first dreamed this up,

24:01.048 --> 24:02.876
never in my wildest dreams

24:02.919 --> 24:06.227
did I imagine anything
as exciting and heartfelt

24:06.270 --> 24:08.490
and dramatic as
we'’ve seen thus far.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.449
But, look, y'’all didn't
come here to hear me

24:10.492 --> 24:12.015
talk today, right?

24:12.059 --> 24:13.539
Let'’s get the real
talented people up here.

25:45.805 --> 25:47.720

they'’re not adaptable.

25:51.071 --> 25:56.119

27:32.868 --> 27:35.436
champion is...

27:41.877 --> 27:43.531
Jenny Leigh!

27:57.110 --> 27:58.415
- I'’m sorry.

28:08.512 --> 28:10.514
- Baby, don'’t you do that.
Come here.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.256
Hey, you listen to me.

28:13.300 --> 28:15.519
You got up there,
you stayed true to yourself

28:15.563 --> 28:18.871
and you sang your
gorgeous heart out.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.873
I call that being a winner,
so good.

28:20.916 --> 28:24.746
- I'’m so proud of you.
You okay?

28:24.790 --> 28:28.271
- It'’s so weird to think that
I'’m going back to normal life.

28:28.315 --> 28:29.925
- Okay, I'’m sorry to say that,
after that,

28:29.969 --> 28:31.797
your life'’s gonna
be normal again.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.276
- Do you remember when
you used to feel like

28:33.320 --> 28:35.714
I was going on some big
adventure without you?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.759
I'’m kind of feeling
like that right now.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.543
- No, you'’re not.
You'’re insane.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.893
- We'’ll see about that.

28:40.936 --> 28:43.939
- Hey.

28:43.983 --> 28:45.288
- Thank you.

28:45.332 --> 28:47.290
- Oh, I didn'’t do anything.

28:47.334 --> 28:50.163
- Yes, you did, so thank you.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.820
- Yeah, yeah, I'’m actually
pretty excited about it.

28:54.863 --> 28:57.823
- That'’s great.

28:57.866 --> 29:02.784
So when you get back, maybe
we can write or something.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.786
- I'’d like that, yeah.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.484
- I'’d like that too.
- Okay.

29:13.229 --> 29:15.536
- I have no idea what
you'’re talking about.

29:15.579 --> 29:16.842
- I would not be
opposed to that.

29:16.885 --> 29:18.191
- Oh, you wouldn'’t
be opposed, eh?

29:18.234 --> 29:20.846
- I'’m just saying.
- Give me a...

29:33.162 --> 29:35.208
- Wow, what a crew!

29:35.251 --> 29:37.471
Well, don'’t tell me y'all
are forming a band.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.081
- Here'’s what's
gonna happen, Brad.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.996
I'’m gonna offer you
$15 million dollars

29:41.040 --> 29:43.303
and you are gonna sell
me Shiny New Records

29:43.346 --> 29:44.478
before we walk out of here.

29:53.226 --> 29:56.229
- First of all, piss ant,
I don'’t sell. I buy.

29:56.272 --> 29:58.884
And, second of all, that'’s 5%
of what this company'’s worth.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.624
- Oh, I know.
- Oh, good.

30:00.668 --> 30:01.625
Okay, then why don'’t
y'’all skedaddle.

30:01.669 --> 30:03.323
Let me get back to my business.

30:03.366 --> 30:04.803
- Promise if we do that,
this young woman is gonna feel

30:04.846 --> 30:06.717
the need to tell her story
to the world.

30:06.761 --> 30:09.111
I don'’t think it's a story
you want the world to hear.

30:09.155 --> 30:11.853
- No, I'’m sure it's not if I
believe there'’s any truth to it.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.334
But as it so happens,
I can assure you

30:14.377 --> 30:15.901
it'’s complete and utter bull.

30:15.944 --> 30:18.164
- Brad: Just one night.
Nobody has to know.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.862
- Alannah: Brad, stop!

30:20.906 --> 30:22.211
- Brad: Mother...hey!

30:22.255 --> 30:24.344
Hold on, hold on!

30:24.387 --> 30:26.389
You'’re not going anywhere 'til
I clarify something with you.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.565
Look, you knew what
you were doing...

30:28.609 --> 30:30.654
- I can'’t make out what that
damn thing'’s saying. Can you?

30:30.698 --> 30:32.482
I certainly can'’t tell if
it'’s me or not.

30:32.526 --> 30:35.834
- Well, lucky for me, I'’m not
the only one with a story.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.627
- I don'’t even know
some of them women!

30:46.670 --> 30:49.282
- That'’s funny because
you sure paid them

30:49.325 --> 30:51.110
a lot of money to keep quiet.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.246
- And one more thing.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.335
You'’re gonna grant me
full custody of Jake.

31:11.434 --> 31:13.219
- Monster!

31:13.262 --> 31:15.308
Are you packing yourself?

31:16.918 --> 31:19.138
- Oh, my gosh,
she'’s so heavy.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.574
I'’m not gonna be able
to carry you.

31:20.617 --> 31:21.836
- Oh, here, I can take her
for very long.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.794
I know, my goodness,
look at you.

31:33.065 --> 31:34.718
- Yeah.

31:34.762 --> 31:37.025
Every time the door opens,
I think maybe it'’s...

31:39.332 --> 31:41.812
- Maybe I'’ll let you just
take some time, you know?

31:41.856 --> 31:44.206
- Yeah.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.165

for a short visit.

34:23.017 --> 34:24.410
- Juliette...

34:26.803 --> 34:29.589
I need you.

34:29.632 --> 34:34.202
And I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

34:34.246 --> 34:35.421
And if you would...

34:36.683 --> 34:37.988
- Yes.

34:55.963 --> 35:01.142
- Hi, sweetie.
Hi, sweetie. Come here.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.753
- You wanna go show
Daddy all the animals?

35:03.797 --> 35:06.104
- Yeah.
- Let'’s show him the goats.

35:08.671 --> 35:10.108
- I had it on this morning,
I swear!

35:10.151 --> 35:11.457
- Sweetie, I'’m sure
it'’s on the bus.

35:11.500 --> 35:12.936
And they'’ll find it,
I promise, okay?

35:12.980 --> 35:14.503
- Wait. I took it off
to wash my hands.

35:14.547 --> 35:16.201
- Look what I found.

35:16.244 --> 35:19.900
- Hey!

35:19.943 --> 35:21.423
- Good girl.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.382
- It is now.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.474
- Save that for
the wedding night, please?

35:30.476 --> 35:33.783
Don'’t freak out.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.829
- I wouldn'’t have...

35:35.872 --> 35:38.788
These two are very insistent.

35:40.964 --> 35:43.750
- They are that.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.970
- I'’ve been reading about
each leg of your tour.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.581
Dream come true
for you, right?

35:48.624 --> 35:51.453
- Been something else, yeah.

35:51.497 --> 35:53.020
- I'’m proud of you.

35:57.329 --> 36:02.203
- Thank you.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.639
Sorry, I gotta...

36:24.051 --> 36:25.879
Is this real?

36:25.922 --> 36:28.273
- You bet your sweet ass,
this is real, honey.

36:28.316 --> 36:31.363
And I got the ring
to prove it.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.934
Oh, my gosh, I was just
in the bathroom thinking

36:37.978 --> 36:40.328
about the first time
I ever came here.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.851
And the place was such
a God-awful mess.

36:43.549 --> 36:46.900
And I remember thinking, okay,
actually this might be

36:46.943 --> 36:50.469
my favorite place on
the planet... with you.

36:53.341 --> 36:54.690
- Phew.

36:56.039 --> 36:57.389
- I just...nothing
that can'’t wait

36:57.432 --> 36:58.825
'’til after our
wedding night...

36:58.868 --> 37:00.174
- Oh, no, no.
This is our wedding night.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.523
I want to know every
single thing

37:01.567 --> 37:05.135
that'’s happening
in that brain of yours.

37:05.179 --> 37:09.749
- I'’m thinking
it'’s too good to be true.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.794
- Yeah.

37:11.838 --> 37:15.015
I mean, how is it happened
that all this stuff I done,

37:15.058 --> 37:20.803
all these things, all these
regrets, they'’re just what?

37:20.847 --> 37:22.196
Gone?

37:22.240 --> 37:24.546
- Not gone. Past.

37:24.590 --> 37:27.549
- Exactly, which means
it'’s still hanging around.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.639
Just waiting to...
I don'’t know.

37:30.683 --> 37:33.555
It'’s like raindrops
in a barrel.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.557
And it'’s right at the top,
all that pain.

37:35.601 --> 37:37.429
And just one more
raindrop and...

37:38.865 --> 37:40.823
- I know, honey, yes.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.783
We'’ve hurt each other.
We have our past.

37:43.826 --> 37:45.959
Because sometimes once
in your life,

37:46.002 --> 37:49.005
somebody gets into
your bloodstream.

37:49.049 --> 37:52.052
Doesn'’t matter how much
you'’ve failed each other.

37:52.095 --> 37:55.360
We must choose each other.

37:55.403 --> 37:59.799
And I choose you
exactly the way you are.

37:59.842 --> 38:03.977
And I'’m gonna love you forever,
forever and ever.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.763
- Amen.

38:22.778 --> 38:23.866
Deacon?

38:30.177 --> 38:32.005
- Yeah.

38:32.048 --> 38:36.052
- There'’s a pretty large group
of people in the other room.

38:36.096 --> 38:38.228
I'’d say they're nice
and ready to hear you play.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.103
- Yeah.

38:44.713 --> 38:46.324
Thank you!

38:46.367 --> 38:48.369
This has been unbelievable,
I gotta tell you.

38:48.413 --> 38:50.719
Seeing so many
friendly faces here

38:50.763 --> 38:52.460
in this gorgeous
Ryman Auditorium.

38:52.504 --> 38:55.333
These last few months, all
these cities we been playing,

38:55.376 --> 38:56.508
I been living a dream.

38:56.551 --> 38:57.900
But I can promise you this.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.380
Nothing compares to being
right back here

38:59.424 --> 39:01.295
in the mother church
of country music

39:01.339 --> 39:02.731
with all you people
I love so much.

39:02.775 --> 39:05.430
So thank you.

39:05.473 --> 39:08.258
Each one of you has
given me something

39:08.302 --> 39:11.087
or taught me a lesson
or been there for me

39:11.131 --> 39:14.656
in a moment of need, and...

39:18.617 --> 39:20.749
There'’s someone I want to
mention right now, actually.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.882
A lot of y'’all don't know him.

39:22.925 --> 39:26.276
But this man has been a
profound influence on my life

39:26.320 --> 39:28.104
and on my music.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.193
Actually, if things had shaken
out a little bit differently,

39:30.237 --> 39:31.673
he would have had one hell
of a musical career his ownself.

39:31.717 --> 39:34.067
Will you please welcome
to the stage my father,

39:34.110 --> 39:35.111
Gideon Claybourne?

39:35.155 --> 39:36.591
That'’s my dad!

39:36.635 --> 39:38.376
Give him a guitar!

39:50.953 --> 39:52.390
Oh, Dad, I'’m sorry.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.608
Do you know this song?

39:53.652 --> 39:55.480
- Son, I know all your songs.
