Hey, Ricky, listen, it's Terry.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.476
Listen, they're on to me.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.695
Okay, I'm leaving the backpack
at the Hook and Ladder,

03:37.739 --> 03:40.350
the place that we
met last, okay?

03:40.394 --> 03:44.398
You got five to 10 minutes,
you gotta come quick.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.234
Don't worry.

cop betrayed us, man.

Fucking cunt.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.689
- Yeah, sad waste of pussy.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.255
Good pussy that is.

04:18.387 --> 04:19.346
- Yeah, brother.

04:20.608 --> 04:23.263
Nah, nah.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.134
It makes sense, man.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.268
- Makes sense
about what, Monroe?

04:28.311 --> 04:30.052
- How she played us.

04:32.141 --> 04:34.012
We're gonna get her back.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.405
- Damn sure we'll get her back.

04:36.319 --> 04:38.016
Every dog has its day.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.627
Especially a bitch like her.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.324
Know that.

04:41.368 --> 04:44.240
- All right, all

[thunder cracking]

04:54.468 --> 04:57.645
Well, let me ask you, are you
sure you can handle yourself?

04:57.688 --> 04:59.516
You don't need me
or nothing, right?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.866
- Monroe, I can handle this.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.495
- What do I do now?

05:25.194 --> 05:30.155
Okay, all right,
whatever you say.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.507

06:17.551 --> 06:20.597
- Okay, if that's
how you want it.

06:20.641 --> 06:23.774
Why don't you call the police?

06:23.818 --> 06:27.430
[foreboding music continues]

06:50.671 --> 06:51.411
- Up.

06:52.455 --> 06:53.238
Fuck that.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.246
He got away.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.600
He won't get far,
this I assure you.

07:11.561 --> 07:13.563
You underestimated this.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.391
I know what happened.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.698
- Seemed to be our
best bet at this point.

07:17.741 --> 07:18.916
What's our timeframe?

07:18.960 --> 07:21.528
- We have a 24-hour window.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.312
And that we can't lose.

07:24.487 --> 07:26.533
- I don't understand.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.665
- I'll explain
everything to you later.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.362
Right now I gotta
make a phone call.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.234
See what we can get on this.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.889
- The only people in this
circle that we can trust.

07:37.369 --> 07:40.547
- I wouldn't have
it any other way.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.591
- Agreed.

07:44.681 --> 07:45.552

07:59.435 --> 08:03.004
- Yes, I know, my
legs are killing me.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.701
There are only two
people I trust.

08:08.096 --> 08:09.532
Yes, there is.

Oh my god.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.597
What can I do for you today?

do a favor for me.

09:17.339 --> 09:19.820
I need you to pick [mumbles].

- I need you to pick up
that thing for me [mumbles].

09:24.389 --> 09:25.782
- Is it at the same spot?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.479

same spot all the time.

you need some pussy, Dave.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.271
What's up?

09:36.314 --> 09:37.489

gone three years, man,

09:37.533 --> 09:38.273
you know that.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.187
- Three years?

09:39.230 --> 09:40.797
That's a long time, man.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.103
- Yeah, three years, man.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.365
- Yo, I always got
somebody for you, B.

09:43.408 --> 09:45.062
You gotta come out
with me one time, man.

09:45.106 --> 09:46.586
- I'm not a whore like
you, I don't do that.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.588
I need to center myself
with inner peace.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.198
You know what I'm saying?
- Said a piece.

09:50.241 --> 09:51.503
- Inner peace, inner peace.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.201
- Inner peace, you gotta
get it together, man.

09:53.244 --> 09:54.724
Come out with me one time, man.

09:54.768 --> 09:57.205
- Oh my, all right,
look man, let me,

09:57.248 --> 09:58.510
you got an hour or two.

09:58.554 --> 09:59.773

want, crash here.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.993
Like always and
fucking, you know,

10:03.037 --> 10:05.735
I'll just go handle
that for you, all right?

10:05.779 --> 10:06.867
- I bet.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.216
Yo, I'm hungry as a
motherfucker, man.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.783
You got some food in
the fridge, what's up?

11:29.776 --> 11:31.821
- It's hard to explain, man.

11:31.865 --> 11:35.651
- Sit on the couch, sit
on the couch, come on.

11:39.176 --> 11:40.090
Be careful.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.096
What the hell happened man?

11:46.140 --> 11:47.576
- Its hard to explain
I was being chased.

11:47.619 --> 11:49.839
- Who were you being chased by?

11:49.883 --> 11:51.536
- You gotta listen.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.103
Who, who you talkin' to?

11:53.147 --> 11:55.018
- I'm right here.

11:55.062 --> 11:58.369
- I told you stop
smoking that shit right.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.458

Who was chasing you?

[mumbles]

12:07.422 --> 12:09.903
- What do you mean?
Find out what?

12:11.556 --> 12:12.427
- Just relax.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.124
- I'm calm, I'm calm brother.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.038
- Stay calm.

12:15.082 --> 12:16.561

12:24.918 --> 12:25.701

12:38.322 --> 12:40.760
- What the fuck is that Rick?

12:42.979 --> 12:45.112
Nah, that can't be real man.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.381
- What the fuck is that Rick?

12:55.862 --> 12:58.125
- Nah that can't be real man.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.346
- You have to stick your
fingers into the jar.

13:05.045 --> 13:05.610
- Say what now?

13:07.047 --> 13:09.832
You want me to stick my
fingers in the fucking fluid?

13:09.876 --> 13:11.660
Are you fucking serious Rick?

13:13.662 --> 13:15.882
- You really have to trust me.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.622
- Are you fucking serious?

13:22.323 --> 13:23.063
You're my brother.

13:23.106 --> 13:23.846
And I love you, man.

13:31.767 --> 13:32.899
- Don't hurt it.

13:36.076 --> 13:37.207
I'll be careful.

13:38.992 --> 13:40.210
Then he got a brief headache.

13:40.254 --> 13:42.343
It's only the last few
seconds. I promise.

13:53.397 --> 13:54.834
- How you feeling?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.183
- How'm I feeling?

13:58.707 --> 14:00.100
I don't feel nothing man.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.319
Everything is copacetic, right?

14:58.027 --> 15:00.812
Christ. They get the
voices in my head, man.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.858
What the fuck is this?

15:04.991 --> 15:06.122
This is crazy.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.216
This man, I need a drink please.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.458
I'm going go do a job.

15:40.896 --> 15:44.595
Okay. I'll be back on
an hour to come back.

15:44.639 --> 15:47.337
When I come back
we'll talk about all.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.382
Figure something out.

15:57.608 --> 16:01.482
I take a shower to take
them with me to be safe.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.842
- Take him with you.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.670
- Now I have to take
him with me too?

16:15.713 --> 16:19.587
- You're gonna be safe,
he's gonna protect you.

16:25.462 --> 16:29.075
- Please I need
you. We need you.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.251
- All right give me the bag.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.088
Just relax.

16:42.131 --> 16:42.958
Just relax.

16:54.317 --> 16:59.018
The things I do for you.
You're lucky I love you.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.810
hello? Why are you smelling?

17:08.853 --> 17:09.984
The hormones?

17:12.596 --> 17:14.990
Hormones is right enlightenment.

17:15.034 --> 17:15.772
One second.

17:15.817 --> 17:17.036
What happened?

17:19.167 --> 17:23.172
Pheromones is a certain chemical
that all living things give

17:23.215 --> 17:26.567
off due to stress,
different behaviors.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.049
Dr. Silva gave me these guests

17:32.138 --> 17:36.098
so I could be tagged
with these pheromones.

17:38.057 --> 17:42.148
You see, there's a reason
why he gave me these gifts

17:45.281 --> 17:49.329
and no gifts to you.
I'm his number one

17:51.461 --> 17:52.941
- And you're his number two.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.516
Let's go.

18:22.840 --> 18:24.973
Take a shower. Take a shower.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.650
[door closes]

18:57.571 --> 18:58.441
- Where are we going?

18:58.485 --> 18:59.747
I'm getting bad feelings.

18:59.790 --> 19:00.704
What do you mean?

19:00.748 --> 19:02.097
You're getting a bad feeling.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.143
Something is not right.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.014
I've started to
understand this more

19:06.057 --> 19:08.190
and more as I heal enough.

19:08.234 --> 19:08.973
- All right.

19:09.017 --> 19:09.931
I'll tell you what.

19:09.974 --> 19:11.193
Just let me handle my business.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.499
I got to go do a job.

19:12.542 --> 19:13.804
Let me handle my business.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.415
And then I have to get
you a distraction point.

19:15.458 --> 19:19.027
Alright. By the way, you never
told me how you got here.

19:19.070 --> 19:21.203
- Oh, short down for years.

19:21.247 --> 19:24.075
We have to turn to make contacts

19:24.119 --> 19:27.470
but everyone we've come across
to try to make us a study

19:27.514 --> 19:30.299
of some sort of
worse, wrong test.

19:30.343 --> 19:31.213
Wow.

19:31.257 --> 19:32.649
- That's logic.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.911
I mean, that's logical.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.000
I mean, I could
see that happening.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.046
Like I'm sorry to
hear about that, man.

19:38.089 --> 19:41.310
I mean, nobody deserves
that, but like I said

19:41.354 --> 19:42.093
I'm gonna help you get home.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.356
I promise.

19:43.399 --> 19:46.185
Okay. I mean, this
is crazy woman

19:46.228 --> 19:48.665
in his brainy woman
is nice outside.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.145
I mean, Jesus Christ.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.713
Like is you messing
with the weather?

19:52.756 --> 19:54.497
Hey, I know what its you.

19:54.541 --> 19:55.281
Tell me that.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.717
It's you, right?

So you take care of them yet?

37:46.612 --> 37:50.442
We did, but not all is
passed on to another person.

37:50.485 --> 37:52.444
So there's one dead, and another

37:52.487 --> 37:55.011
that's attempting to get him
to the location, correct?

37:55.055 --> 37:56.361
Have you contacted Dr.

37:56.404 --> 38:00.365
Silva? He knows what
I need to know about.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.285

under control.

38:22.082 --> 38:23.475

two trains, man.

59:42.970 --> 59:43.710
All right.

59:45.059 --> 59:45.973
I understand.

59:46.017 --> 59:48.454
All right, you did that, right?

59:48.497 --> 59:50.630
Okay, better.

59:50.674 --> 59:51.457
All right, bro.

59:52.676 --> 59:54.634
I got Ricky's ashes
with me right now.

59:54.678 --> 59:56.244
Just waiting on you, bro.

59:56.288 --> 59:57.376
You gotta pick up El?

59:58.899 --> 1:00:00.292
All right, better.

1:00:02.076 --> 1:00:03.730
All right, 10 minutes.

1:00:03.774 --> 1:00:05.297
Sorry, I'm coming
down right now.

1:00:06.559 --> 1:00:08.648
I'll wait for you
to parking lot.

1:00:08.692 --> 1:00:10.650
I told you I'm at the
train station, man.

1:00:12.217 --> 1:00:13.174
All right.

1:00:13.218 --> 1:00:14.001
All right.

1:00:14.045 --> 1:00:15.046
Peace. Yeah.

1:00:18.310 --> 1:00:19.180
Damn Stevie.

1:00:38.417 --> 1:00:39.244
Damn Stevie.

1:00:48.862 --> 1:00:49.776
- Jason?

1:00:49.820 --> 1:00:50.864
- Yeah who wants to know?

1:00:50.908 --> 1:00:53.737
- I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

1:00:53.780 --> 1:00:55.913
[mumbles]

1:00:58.698 --> 1:01:02.746
- I know, I know but I was
ordered to put you in quarantine

1:01:02.789 --> 1:01:03.964
so, step this way.

1:01:04.008 --> 1:01:07.141
- I'm not going
anywhere with you man.

1:01:09.404 --> 1:01:11.624
[mumbles]

1:01:39.217 --> 1:01:42.611
- Oh by the way. I'm
not gonna kill you.

1:02:15.862 --> 1:02:19.648
- I keep telling you
I'm not going anywhere.

1:02:48.939 --> 1:02:52.507
- I told you I'm not
going anywhere. Fuck.

1:03:03.301 --> 1:03:04.911
- Attention.
Attention. All local

1:03:04.955 --> 1:03:09.698
and government law enforcement
agencies. There is an APP on

1:03:09.742 --> 1:03:13.790

foot 9, 195 pounds, black and

1:03:13.833 --> 1:03:15.052

1:03:15.095 --> 1:03:17.706
He is considered
extremely dangerous.

1:03:17.750 --> 1:03:19.143
Please proceed with caution.

1:03:19.186 --> 1:03:22.886
He is to be apprehended and
brought in for questioning.

1:03:22.929 --> 1:03:26.890
Once again we advice you. He
is considered very dangerous.

1:03:28.239 --> 1:03:31.764

anywhere. You want me?

1:03:31.808 --> 1:03:32.721
Come get me.

1:03:52.872 --> 1:03:55.788
