00:42.640 --> 00:46.320
Next time I volunteer to be director,
you should hit me with your broom.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.040
There's still a few hours to go
before Miss Cackle's show.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.360
We haven't even practiced
the final number yet.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.680
- Look at me.
- And now I've lost my song sheet.

00:53.760 --> 00:55.760
Has anyone seen my special folder?

00:56.120 --> 00:58.440
How am I supposed to do this
when no one listens?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.400
It's a trick my mum taught me.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.920
Okay, Gloria, you're up first.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.160
- What if Miss Cackle hates it?
- She'll love it.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.160
And if she doesn't,
you've only ruined her birthday.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.600
Okay, let's take it from the top.

01:29.480 --> 01:30.680
Duck!

01:36.560 --> 01:38.320
She was the best act I had.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.960
Cheer up. I bet the first-year rehearsals
are going well.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.040
One, two, three.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.400
- You didn't say "go".
- That's because I was counting.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.080
Let's try again.

01:52.360 --> 01:55.520
- One, two...
- Wait, do we go when you say three

01:55.600 --> 01:57.800
- or do we wait until you say...
- Just go!

02:01.400 --> 02:02.400
Oops.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.320
Don't worry. I'll go and fetch it.

02:10.199 --> 02:11.760
Can't you do anything right?

02:12.480 --> 02:16.120
- I'm sorry, Ethie.
- You will be when Mother finds out.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.080
Don't you think she's got enough
to worry about with Esme?

02:19.560 --> 02:20.800
I'm trying my best.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.160
You should be concentrating
on your studies,

02:23.480 --> 02:26.080
not embarrassing yourself
with this silly show.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.560
Happy Birthday, Agatha.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.400
I'm sorry to do this
on your birthday, but...

02:38.280 --> 02:40.080
I thought you'd want to see this.

02:41.160 --> 02:45.120
- "Crackles at Cackle's"?
- Not the most imaginative headline.

02:45.800 --> 02:47.000
"Concerns have been raised

02:47.080 --> 02:49.960
about falling standards
at Cackle's Academy."

02:50.040 --> 02:51.040
Nonsense.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.760
Oh, dear.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.000
It would seem Mr. Hallow
was true to his word.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.520
Something tells me
this is just the beginning.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.880
Talk about two left feet.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
Ribbit!

03:14.640 --> 03:16.400
How are the girls getting on?

03:16.960 --> 03:19.000
I couldn't resist a little peek.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.240
"Urgent"? Oh, really, Mrs. Hallow?

03:24.160 --> 03:28.480
I expect every witch and her cat
will be sending birthday greetings today.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.920
I wish that were the case.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
How did I do?

03:42.840 --> 03:45.080
- Uh, you were...
- Unforgettable.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.400
Thank you. I knew you'd like it.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.720
What am I gonna do, Mil?
It's a disaster.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.920
It would appear
only Ethel deemed herself fit

03:55.000 --> 03:56.440
for class this morning.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.560
That's because she's not taking part.

03:58.640 --> 04:02.160
We thought there wouldn't be lessons,
with it being Miss Cackle's birthday.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.040
Such frivolities are not part
of the Cackle's Academy curriculum.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.040
- But, Miss Hardbroom!
- But nothing.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.080
The potions lab this instant.

04:16.279 --> 04:19.519
I trust you've all been revising
the transference spell.

04:19.959 --> 04:25.360
Perhaps you'd care to start us off
with the first ingredient, Maud Spellbody?

04:25.440 --> 04:26.920
- Uh...
- She's been too busy

04:27.000 --> 04:28.480
working on her stupid show.

04:29.480 --> 04:30.480
Ethel.

04:31.920 --> 04:34.320
The first ingredient.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.640
- Slither of bee sting, Miss Hardbroom.
- Thank you, Ethel.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.520
Well, don't just stand there.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.640
I'll sting her in a minute.

04:49.480 --> 04:52.560
- I'm gonna have to resign as director.
- Why would you do that?

04:52.960 --> 04:54.880
You saw what happened.
I'm not good enough.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.440
Of course you are.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.960
You just need to stop worrying,
that's all.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.480
That's easy for you to say.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.160
You're not the one
who's ruined Miss Cackle's special day.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.760
Poor Maud. I wish we could help her.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.640
- Maybe we can.
- How?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.920
She's got stage fright.
My parents get that all the time.

05:19.320 --> 05:23.120
So, we just need to find a spell
that stops her getting so stressed.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.040
- How about the Happiness Spell?
- What's that?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.960
It stops all your worries
and makes you happy again.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.680
So Maud will be able to focus
on Miss Cackle's show.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.040
Exactly.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.320
You keep her distracted,
I'll sort out the potion.

05:40.440 --> 05:44.280
- This isn't gonna go wrong, is it?
- When have I ever let you down?

05:46.600 --> 05:48.680
You need to show the broom
who's in charge.

05:48.760 --> 05:49.760
I'm trying.

05:56.320 --> 05:59.480
Sybil Hallow, apologise this instant!

05:59.960 --> 06:01.240
Sorry, Miss Cackle.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
No harm done.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.320
Is everything okay, Miss Cackle?

06:12.960 --> 06:13.960
Is it ready?

06:14.160 --> 06:17.480
Just a dash more pond slime
and the shell of a rotten egg.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.520
Miss Hardbroom, can I borrow you
for a moment? It's Miss Cackle.

06:27.240 --> 06:30.680
I've just seen her
wandering around the grounds.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.880
She has a lot on her mind.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.920
It's just that...

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
she got a message on her maglet.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.360
Something tells me
they weren't wishing her a happy birthday.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.080
Girls, I need to run an errand.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.120
Now's our chance.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.680
<i>Catch those tears, remove all trace
Take Maud to her happy place.</i>

07:01.720 --> 07:03.680
- Is it ready?
- I think so.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.800
- I got you some dried nettles.
- Oh, we won't need those.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.480
- The potion's ready.
- It is?

07:09.840 --> 07:15.560
Why don't you try it?
Everything will seem better, I promise.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
Where did she go?

07:25.280 --> 07:26.280
Look.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.600
What is it?

07:29.160 --> 07:30.280
Don't you see?

07:30.880 --> 07:31.880
It's Maud.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.880
- What's that noise?
- What noise?

07:36.360 --> 07:37.520
It sounds like a baby.

07:41.080 --> 07:42.640
Now look what you've done.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.200
You two are so weird.

08:01.560 --> 08:04.000
I take it you haven't spoken
to Mrs. Hallow.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.120
I'm not sure I can face her yet.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.480
I wonder...

08:11.080 --> 08:14.560
if the time has come for me
to pack up my broom and move on.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.960
It most certainly hasn't.

08:17.360 --> 08:20.080
But when I think about everything
that's happened...

08:20.160 --> 08:22.240
the fire,
the Founding Stone going missing.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.280
- None of that was your fault.
- On the contrary.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.960
The girls are in my care.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.640
It's my job to protect them.

08:30.760 --> 08:31.760
Which you do.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.520
I'm not sure Mrs. Hallow
would agree with you.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.080
Still...

08:41.559 --> 08:44.880
today's all about celebrating
everything that's special about Cackle's.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.920
You tell Maud I can't wait to see
what they have in store.

09:01.080 --> 09:02.440
Why is Maud a baby?

09:02.520 --> 09:05.200
The spell must've taken her back
to when she was happiest.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.960
- So what do we do?
- We'll have to try and reverse it.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.800
Where are you going?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.640
- Spell Science, Miss Hardbroom.
- Not anymore.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.440
The academic timetable is suspended
for the rest of the day.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.120
But why?

09:17.200 --> 09:19.000
It's imperative
that we show Miss Cackle

09:19.320 --> 09:22.120
just how much she means to the school.

09:23.200 --> 09:26.640
Now, where is Maud Spellbody?

09:27.320 --> 09:28.600
The-The thing is...

09:28.680 --> 09:31.160
The transference spell,
it only went and worked.

09:31.720 --> 09:33.080
She hasn't transferred back?

09:33.880 --> 09:37.000
She said something about
sorting out some scenery.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.920
Then can the rest of you

09:40.000 --> 09:42.600
please make your way
to the Chanting classroom

09:42.680 --> 09:44.600
to resume rehearsals?

09:46.280 --> 09:49.560
This is my fault. I should never
have made her take the potion.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.240
You cover for Maud, I'll fix this.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.040
It would seem
we are still missing a director.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.440
Maud sent me in her place.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.240
She's still doing
important backstage stuff.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.480
Chickened out!

10:08.680 --> 10:11.440
- And you could do a better job?
- With my eyes closed.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.000
- The job's yours.
- Please! I'll fill in for her.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.640
I know the show.

10:16.360 --> 10:20.560
It's time to put vanity to one side
and concentrate on the task at hand.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.640
Miss Cackle's expecting a lot from today.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.760
And I for one am going to make sure
we put on the best performance possible.

10:28.760 --> 10:32.840
I look forward to significant progress
on my return.

10:33.640 --> 10:35.000
Don't take it to heart.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.400
Everyone knows
Maud's not a natural leader.

10:38.360 --> 10:40.280
She's more of a hanger-on.

10:42.320 --> 10:46.040
Now, if you don't mind,
I've got a show to direct.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.320
Right!

10:51.960 --> 10:54.480
Will you stop pinching me?

10:54.840 --> 10:57.840
If HB finds you, we'll all get expelled.

10:58.400 --> 10:59.400
Here it is.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.080
Now, all I need to do
is find the reversal spell.

11:09.640 --> 11:10.640
Maud!

11:19.880 --> 11:22.520
Now you stay here
while I clean up your mess.

11:30.480 --> 11:31.480
Surely not.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.200
What have we here?

11:35.920 --> 11:38.320
Oh! Oh!

11:39.160 --> 11:40.520
Have we met before?

11:41.240 --> 11:43.120
You look awfully familiar.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.080
Let's get you some grasshoppers
and milk, shall we?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Maud!

12:07.520 --> 12:10.640
It doesn't matter if you get it wrong.
It's taking part that counts.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.560
I'm a Hallow.
I have to be the best.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.720
Maybe if you just talked to Ethel.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.440
Ethel?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.440
She's in charge now.

12:26.720 --> 12:28.800
Mil, why are you not in rehearsals?

12:28.880 --> 12:31.280
Because Miss Hardbroom
let Ethel take over.

12:32.720 --> 12:33.720
Where's Maud?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.240
Funny you mention that.

12:37.720 --> 12:41.400
- The thing is... I might've lost her.
- I'm not in the mood for jokes.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.960
It wasn't my fault, I swear.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.080
Why can't you be responsible
for once?

12:45.160 --> 12:48.560
It's bad enough that I turned Maud
into a baby. Now you've lost her.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.880
- Where are you going?
- We need to split up and find her.

12:57.680 --> 13:01.000
Could you all take a copy
of the revised line-up, please?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.400
My number isn't on here.

13:08.720 --> 13:09.880
Or our broom dance.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.760
- That's because you're not good enough.
- I was told I was unforgettable.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.520
I'm in charge now.

13:15.640 --> 13:16.880
I think what Ethel means

13:16.960 --> 13:21.400
is that more time is needed
to nurture your individual talents.

13:21.640 --> 13:24.640
So we're going back to basics
with a more traditional performance.

13:24.720 --> 13:25.720
Such as?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.400
The instrument-less orchestra

13:27.480 --> 13:30.160
will be performing
the "Witches' Concerto in D minor".

13:30.240 --> 13:32.360
You can moan all you like.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.560
This is my chance to impress Miss Cackle,

13:35.480 --> 13:37.400
and I won't let anyone spoil it.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
VERY URGENT

14:01.760 --> 14:02.760
Got you.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.080
Maud!

14:22.520 --> 14:23.600
"Finding Spell."

14:25.280 --> 14:26.280
Maybe.

14:29.920 --> 14:33.560
<i>No more tricks, no more maybes
Help me find our missing baby.</i>

14:38.000 --> 14:40.600
Two hundred baby frogs.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.760
About to make their way
into the pond of life.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.480
Gets me quite emotional, actually.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.440
Algy!

14:52.800 --> 14:53.840
Miss Bat.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.640
How can I be of assistance?

14:57.760 --> 14:59.880
- It's a baby!
- What is?

15:00.200 --> 15:03.800
What's more, it has the look
of a young Maud Spellbody.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.160
- Where is she now?
- In the Potions lab.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.560
Turns out she's not a fan of grasshoppers.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.160
Well, let me just help Enid

15:13.240 --> 15:15.440
- and then we'll go and investigate.
- Yes!

15:39.800 --> 15:41.760
Felicity, you came in late again.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.120
My mother says I'm musically gifted.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.680
Then she needs to get her ears tested.

15:46.760 --> 15:49.080
Perhaps Gloria could take the triangle.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
Yeah.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.960
Everything alright in here?

15:56.480 --> 15:59.000
Just a bit of fine-tuning, Miss Hardbroom.

16:01.840 --> 16:02.840
Very good.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.280
Ethel.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.680
Perhaps you need to work
on motivating your team.

16:10.120 --> 16:12.480
They just need to be better, that's all.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.320
Once more from the top.

16:16.160 --> 16:17.600
- Where are you going?
- I quit!

16:20.280 --> 16:21.280
- Me, too!
- And me!

16:21.680 --> 16:23.960
Sybil, what do you think you're doing?

16:25.400 --> 16:26.880
I don't want to embarrass you.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.440
Fine. We don't need you anyway.

16:33.600 --> 16:36.320
So, where is this baby?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.600
Sleeping in that pram.

16:45.560 --> 16:49.760
- Maud Spellbody, you say?
- She's the spitting image of her.

16:53.320 --> 16:55.320
I can't quite see it myself.

16:56.240 --> 17:00.560
It was Maud Spellbody.
I recognise that glint in her eyes.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.599
I think you ought to have
a little lie-down, dear.

17:05.680 --> 17:06.760
Oh!

17:20.359 --> 17:21.599
How are rehearsals going?

17:21.680 --> 17:23.680
Ethel wouldn't know talent
if it bit her.

17:23.920 --> 17:26.720
- But there is still gonna be a show?
- I wouldn't count on it.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.560
Miss Drill, have you seen Miss Cackle?

17:32.360 --> 17:35.720
Not since this morning.
Is something wrong, Mildred?

17:37.000 --> 17:39.800
It's Maud. She's a baby.

17:39.880 --> 17:43.480
Aw, we'll toughen her up.
Tell her to come see me first thing.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.640
Ah, Mildred.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.440
How can I be of assistance?

18:07.120 --> 18:10.280
- It's Maud, Miss Cackle.
- Has something happened?

18:10.920 --> 18:12.320
She was doing so well.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.280
But then I had to go
and spoil everything.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.040
In my experience,

18:19.000 --> 18:22.240
the only way to deal with a problem
is not to run away from it.

18:25.200 --> 18:28.800
I'm sure whatever's happened,
we can come up with a solution.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.360
No more pinching or pulling my hair.

18:36.720 --> 18:39.160
Or trying to clobber me
with old broomsticks.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.160
Do you understand me?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.640
Please, Maud,
I don't know how to do this.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.480
I've never had any brothers
and sisters to look after.

18:54.640 --> 19:00.640

And where is Maud now?

19:17.440 --> 19:18.520
Enid lost her.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.960
And what do we have here?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.760
It's Maud, Miss Cackle.

19:33.120 --> 19:36.320
I can see that.
I'd recognise that smile anywhere.

19:36.560 --> 19:38.520
We're really sorry, Miss Cackle.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.600
I'll think of an appropriate punishment
another day.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.120
It'd be a shame for Maud to have
to miss out after all her hard work.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.360
Welcome back, Maud.

19:52.680 --> 19:53.680
What happened?

19:54.440 --> 19:56.440
You got me into all kinds of trouble.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.720
Do you want to know
what the most powerful spell of all is?

20:02.920 --> 20:05.920
Friendship.
Because when you girls work together,

20:06.480 --> 20:08.920
you can achieve anything
you put your minds to.

20:10.120 --> 20:14.800
Now, let's go and see
all your good work in action, shall we?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.680
This is it.

20:23.120 --> 20:24.640
Break a broom, girls.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.960
Who's in charge?

20:28.600 --> 20:29.600
Ethel.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
Oh, no.

21:02.480 --> 21:04.400
- Do something!
- It's too late.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
No, it's not.

21:09.480 --> 21:12.760
Miss Cackle said we can do anything
as long as we work together.

21:19.600 --> 21:22.320
- Where's Enid going?
- To get your show back.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.800
- How?
- You'll see. Come on.

21:30.480 --> 21:33.200
- I'm sorry we put a spell on you.
- That's alright.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.600
- Can someone give me a hand?
- I'm coming.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.080
But I don't know what to do.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.720
You just got to believe in yourself,
that's all.

21:42.480 --> 21:45.040
Felicity, Gloria, you're on.
Get changed!

21:54.920 --> 21:57.320
Do you think you could still do
your broomstick dance?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.480
Ethel says I'm not good enough.

21:59.640 --> 22:02.720
- It doesn't matter if you get it wrong.
- But I don't have my broom.

22:02.800 --> 22:03.800
Yes, you do.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.520
Ahh!

22:31.120 --> 22:34.240
Ahh!

23:00.040 --> 23:02.320
Welcome to Cackle's Academy, girls.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.120
I was wondering if any of you
have seen my plate of cream cakes.

23:06.200 --> 23:07.680
- Ha ha!
- But don't tell HB.

23:10.840 --> 23:14.040
Where's Mildred Hubble?

23:14.320 --> 23:16.000
Oh, what's she done now?

23:16.080 --> 23:20.240
She appears
to have blown up my Potions lab.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.840
Again.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.560
HB, Cackle,
that's enough chatting from you two.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.880
Get on the floor
and give me five press-ups.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.880
I want to thank you all
for making my birthday so special.

24:48.160 --> 24:50.680
Seeing the effort you've all made today

24:51.720 --> 24:54.280
has reminded me
just how special you girls are.

24:55.800 --> 24:59.640
I think we're all guilty of running away
from our problems from time to time.

25:00.360 --> 25:05.200
But when we work together as a team,
no problem is ever insurmountable.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.440
Because at the end of the day,
what matters is friendship.

25:10.480 --> 25:14.520
And there are no greater friends
than my girls at Cackle's.

25:16.720 --> 25:20.160
And I look forward to leading you
for as long as I am able.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.720
Mildred Hubble.

25:31.600 --> 25:35.240
It would seem you are quite
the impressionist.

25:37.200 --> 25:42.920
It takes a brave girl
to ridicule me on stage.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.760
The thing is, Miss Ha...

25:46.880 --> 25:47.880
Well done.

25:55.560 --> 25:56.560
Right.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.080
I think it's time I talk to Mrs. Hallow,
don't you?

26:11.080 --> 26:13.160
- Well met, Your Greatness.
- Well met...

26:13.240 --> 26:16.120
It's just a flying visit.
I wanted to give you this in person.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
What is it?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.600
You have been summoned
by the Magic Council

26:19.800 --> 26:21.000
for an emergency meeting,

26:21.640 --> 26:23.520
seeing as you neglected to reply

26:23.600 --> 26:26.640
to our esteemed
Head of Education's messages.

26:26.960 --> 26:27.960
Mrs. Hallow.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.920
There's been a serious complaint
made about your conduct.

26:33.120 --> 26:35.120
I bid you good day, Miss Cackle.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.560
- I'm not doing it.
- But Maud can't sleep.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.280
Please, Enid.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.280
For the last time.
