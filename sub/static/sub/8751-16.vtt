WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.828
There's a lot of
frickin' dead people here.

00:08.829 --> 00:10.930
We just get that creepy feeling.

00:10.931 --> 00:12.367
You feel it.

00:12.368 --> 00:14.503
He was evil.

00:14.504 --> 00:17.873
He's missing his whole face.

00:17.874 --> 00:19.393
He was found guilty.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.370
- They lost everything?
- They lost everything.

00:21.371 --> 00:23.906
There's a hole in my head.

00:23.907 --> 00:26.175
I want the answers.

00:26.176 --> 00:27.009
This is not good.

00:27.010 --> 00:29.840
Could this be dangerous?

00:29.841 --> 00:34.641
There is an unhealthy
attachment to the dead.

00:36.053 --> 00:38.318
They're being watched.

00:38.319 --> 00:41.439
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.514 --> 00:44.093
This thing likes death.

00:44.094 --> 00:45.128
I see dead people.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.763
This thing's, like, a monster.

00:46.764 --> 00:48.765
I speak to dead people...

00:48.766 --> 00:50.166
And he's pissed off now.

00:50.167 --> 00:51.868
And they speak to me...

00:51.869 --> 00:53.669
His head was cracked.

00:53.670 --> 00:57.206
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:57.207 --> 00:58.742
This guy was murdered.

00:58.743 --> 01:00.241
I rely on my partner...

01:00.242 --> 01:03.544
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective...

01:03.545 --> 01:06.196
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:06.197 --> 01:09.499
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:09.500 --> 01:10.830
You saw her?

01:10.831 --> 01:12.202
It's my job to reveal them.

01:12.203 --> 01:13.237
Why would you stay here?

01:13.238 --> 01:15.530
But Steve and I never speak...

01:15.531 --> 01:17.641
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.009
Until the very end.

01:19.010 --> 01:20.782
Stop it.

01:20.783 --> 01:22.813
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:22.814 --> 01:25.242
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:25.243 --> 01:26.572
Or time to get out.

01:26.573 --> 01:31.313
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074

01:47.839 --> 01:50.107
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

01:50.108 --> 01:53.742
I interview witnesses and research
the history of the location.

01:53.743 --> 01:56.834
To see if there's anything
unusual about its past.

01:56.835 --> 02:00.917
While Amy communicates with the dead.

02:00.918 --> 02:03.720
I'm in Rock Island, Illinois,
a few hours West of Chicago.

02:03.721 --> 02:06.189
I'm on my way to meet
with a woman named Melissa,

02:06.190 --> 02:07.949
who says she and her 4 year old daughter

02:07.950 --> 02:10.926
are being terrorized
by spirits in the house.

02:10.928 --> 02:16.748
She sounds pretty bad, and
I'm hoping Amy and I can help.

02:21.339 --> 02:26.703
Before Amy arrives, I have to clear
the area of any leading information.

02:26.704 --> 02:29.095
This house contains a
lot of family photographs.

02:29.096 --> 02:33.217
So it's important I remove
them, along with the kids' names.

02:33.218 --> 02:37.118
To avoid influencing her findings.

02:55.740 --> 02:58.742
There's a lot of frickin'
dead people here...

02:58.743 --> 03:01.683
Very, very negative.

03:02.313 --> 03:06.573
There's, like, people under the trees.

03:10.155 --> 03:14.223
There's also this other
really creepy dude.

03:14.224 --> 03:17.495
He wears a cloak, and...

03:17.496 --> 03:21.936
He's missing pretty much his whole face.

03:23.445 --> 03:25.981
He works with these people
in the trees, though.

03:25.982 --> 03:29.942
They're, like, underlings for him.

03:31.298 --> 03:35.558
He wants to get rid of living people.

03:50.672 --> 03:53.737
So, Melissa, I understand that you
and your four year old daughter,

03:53.738 --> 03:55.210
are having problems in the house.

03:55.211 --> 03:57.690
- Yes.
- Okay. Who else lives here?

03:57.691 --> 04:01.006
My husband, Mike, and our
7 year old son, Nathan.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.217
And how long you living here?

04:02.218 --> 04:04.382
We've lived here about five years.

04:04.383 --> 04:06.648
So, what kind of things
are you experiencing?

04:06.649 --> 04:10.358
We're seeing apparitions, shadows.

04:10.359 --> 04:14.296
Our daughter, Madison... we
want her to not be afraid.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.314
We want her to have a normal childhood.

04:16.315 --> 04:17.685
What's going on with her?

04:17.687 --> 04:19.926
She would wake up in the
middle of the night screaming,

04:19.927 --> 04:23.262
that a little girl was in her bed.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.497
What about Nathan?

04:24.498 --> 04:28.721
He mentioned that there was one time
he was coming up the basement stairs.

04:28.722 --> 04:31.818
And it felt like someone
grabbed the back of his shirt,

04:31.819 --> 04:34.224
and was trying to pull
him down the stairs.

04:34.225 --> 04:36.509
Now, when did things
kind of pick up here?

04:36.510 --> 04:41.847
When we moved in, I was pregnant with
my son Noah and Nathan was about 2.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.521
And um, I noticed...

04:44.522 --> 04:47.053
Um, a shadow in the basement.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.539
Okay. You said your son
Noah. You didn't mention Noah.

04:49.540 --> 04:55.180
Yeah, I was pregnant with
Noah when we bought the house.

04:55.495 --> 04:59.398
He passed pretty much right
away after he was born.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.999
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.313
There's two people here who are mediums.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.849
One of them is extremely developed.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.910
It might be a child.

05:24.757 --> 05:29.395
This living person is
very attracted to death.

05:29.396 --> 05:32.298
They want it around.

05:32.299 --> 05:38.199
I think there's family members that
this person's held onto or friends.

05:38.938 --> 05:42.778
Unhealthy attachment to the dead.

05:51.518 --> 05:56.255
This is the room that I and my
son feel most uncomfortable in.

05:56.256 --> 05:58.757
We just get that creepy feeling.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.925
I feel like I'm being watched down here.

06:01.926 --> 06:04.723
And we've heard footsteps above us.

06:04.724 --> 06:06.318
Has anybody else heard it besides you?

06:06.319 --> 06:11.303
Yes. When we've had friends
over, they have heard it.

06:11.304 --> 06:16.519
I don't like it, and it's like when I
go up the stairs to go back upstairs...

06:16.520 --> 06:18.961
It's almost like if you were
being chased up the stairs,

06:18.962 --> 06:21.647
how you want to hurry
up and get to the top.

06:21.648 --> 06:24.588
That's how I feel.

06:27.732 --> 06:33.325
The people from the trees, they
do have to [Bleep] with people.

06:33.326 --> 06:37.396
Because they do have
to follow the orders.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.660
The cloaked man who's in
control of the dead from outside

06:40.661 --> 06:43.702
sends them into the basement
to torment the living.

06:43.703 --> 06:47.039
I think it's his mission to
have this house destroyed.

06:47.040 --> 06:50.760
Some of them don't have legs.

06:52.656 --> 06:58.176
I saw one, like, pulling,
pulling on the person's leg.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.987
I know that the living person's scared.

07:04.988 --> 07:10.148
They should be, because
these things are not good.

07:18.430 --> 07:23.775
This is where most of her experiences,
if not all of them, happen.

07:23.776 --> 07:28.080
She would wake up almost nightly
between 3:00 and 3:30 A.M.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.383
And she would be screaming and crying,
there's a little girl in my bed!

07:31.384 --> 07:34.086
Okay. Now, does she say
the girl is threatening her?

07:34.087 --> 07:35.994
She says she wants to play with her.

07:35.995 --> 07:40.069
She says, the little girl wants to play,
and I don't want to play with her, mom.

07:40.070 --> 07:43.268
She wakes up in the middle
of the night, crying um...

07:43.269 --> 07:47.927
Just blood-curdling scream
that there are guys in her ears.

07:47.928 --> 07:53.828
And she'll say that sometimes it
sounds like a whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.056
I don't like being in here by myself.

07:57.057 --> 08:00.755
So I don't really blame her
for not wanting to be in here.

08:00.756 --> 08:03.756
By herself at night.

08:07.939 --> 08:10.155
Mm-mm. No, no, no.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.156
They just come in...

08:14.394 --> 08:18.029
Solid-ass dead people. Like,
they present themselves.

08:18.030 --> 08:21.990
It's a thing they do to mediums.

08:28.243 --> 08:33.342
If they're doing that,
then the kid is advanced.

08:40.153 --> 08:41.912
So, what's going on in here?

08:41.913 --> 08:45.924
This is actually where Madison
was sleeping with me one night.

08:45.925 --> 08:50.362
She wasn't feeling well, and she was
talking about the man under the bed.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.563
Which bed... this one?

08:51.564 --> 08:54.950
This bed, and, actually,
there is no under the bed.

08:54.951 --> 09:00.171
- What do you mean?
- The mattress sits pretty low.

09:00.233 --> 09:01.903
You got about this
much room under there.

09:01.904 --> 09:05.525
Right. And so, I decided to give
her a piece of paper and a crayon,

09:05.526 --> 09:08.059
and I asked her to draw me the picture.

09:08.060 --> 09:13.262
And she drew a circle with a frowny
face and red circles all over its face.

09:13.263 --> 09:16.794
- Do you have that picture?
- I don't still have that picture.

09:16.795 --> 09:18.397
Anything else in this room?

09:18.398 --> 09:23.222
This is also where I experienced what
felt like someone sit on the bed...

09:23.223 --> 09:25.511
And I actually felt the bed...

09:25.512 --> 09:28.628
Like this, like someone sitting there...

09:28.629 --> 09:29.482
Okay.

09:29.483 --> 09:31.863
And I looked and there was
nobody there, and I'm like,

09:31.864 --> 09:36.021
well, maybe I just felt something,
and then I felt the bed lift.

09:36.022 --> 09:38.905
- When this happened, were you sleeping?
- No, I was not asleep yet.

09:38.906 --> 09:43.526
I was laying there,
trying to fall asleep.

09:48.001 --> 09:50.546
The dead in here...

09:50.547 --> 09:53.487
Are from out there.

09:55.388 --> 10:01.088
They are the people from the
trees, and so many come in.

10:04.295 --> 10:07.059
What are they trying to do?

10:07.060 --> 10:09.340
Hurt them.

10:33.321 --> 10:35.381
Mike, I spoke with your wife, Melissa.

10:35.382 --> 10:38.617
It seemed obvious that your
daughter was her biggest concern.

10:38.618 --> 10:41.466
That's the biggest concern
for me is my daughter...

10:41.467 --> 10:44.123
And Melissa has always told me
things that have happened to her,

10:44.124 --> 10:47.717
and I haven't seen it myself, so for
me, it was hard for me to believe...

10:47.718 --> 10:48.523
Right.

10:48.524 --> 10:51.763
But now that the daughter's in the
picture, telling me kind of the same stuff,

10:51.764 --> 10:55.013
I tend to believe Madison
because she's so small.

10:55.014 --> 10:56.335
Have you had any experiences?

10:56.336 --> 10:59.571
- I've had one here in Madison's room.
- Explain that one to me.

10:59.572 --> 11:02.787
It was actually this
shopping cart right here.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.337
And the shopping cart was actually in
the middle of the room, like this...

11:06.338 --> 11:07.152
Okay.

11:07.153 --> 11:11.878
Loaded up with toys, and Madison woke up
screaming and pointed at the shopping cart.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.293
Did you ask her what
she was screaming about?

11:14.294 --> 11:16.905
I just assumed that she wanted
it back by her bed again,

11:16.906 --> 11:21.060
so at that point I just said, all
right. Put it right here next to you.

11:21.061 --> 11:24.629
Must've been probably a half-hour
later... I was back in bed again myself.

11:24.630 --> 11:26.532
She woke up screaming, shrieks.

11:26.533 --> 11:27.632
Okay.

11:27.633 --> 11:30.006
And then I came back in here,
and this rug was in the middle

11:30.007 --> 11:33.472
of the floor and the cart was
turned and pushed to about here.

11:33.473 --> 11:36.448
- What happened? Did she push it?
- Well, that was my first thought.

11:36.449 --> 11:38.190
I'm like, you know,
she just pushed it away,

11:38.191 --> 11:41.110
but then if she just pushed it away,
why would she be screaming about it?

11:41.111 --> 11:42.915
She didn't tell me that
anybody had pushed it.

11:42.916 --> 11:45.300
She didn't tell me that
anybody took it away from her.

11:45.301 --> 11:48.853
She was just screaming,
pointing at that cart that moved.

11:48.854 --> 11:51.871
Now, Mike, after this incident
happened, the stuff you can't explain,

11:51.872 --> 11:54.618
are you a skeptic, not a
skeptic? What's your story?

11:54.619 --> 11:56.675
It opened my eyes is what it did.

11:56.676 --> 11:58.596
Okay.

12:01.434 --> 12:04.554
There's a disturbance.

12:05.371 --> 12:08.551
I hear things moving...

12:10.143 --> 12:11.943
Like, chairs moving...

12:11.944 --> 12:16.384
Mm, maybe a little bit of a poltergeist.

12:18.559 --> 12:21.577
Yeah, and stuff happens in here...

12:21.578 --> 12:23.467
Poltergeist [Bleep] you know?

12:23.468 --> 12:26.011
Poltergeists are usually
created unintentionally,

12:26.012 --> 12:29.640
when someone with abilities
represses intense negative emotions.

12:29.641 --> 12:32.843
These powerful forces can
interact with the physical world,

12:32.844 --> 12:35.512
and in some cases, harm living people.

12:35.513 --> 12:37.548
Do you have any idea
who it's coming from?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.217
- I want to say a female.
- Okay.

12:40.218 --> 12:44.373
The living person doesn't know how to
release their [Bleep] emotions properly.

12:44.374 --> 12:46.276
Anything that could be dangerous?

12:46.277 --> 12:48.137
Yes.

12:50.772 --> 12:53.496
Mike, I know you're probably
at your wits' end with this,

12:53.497 --> 12:56.414
but what are you hoping we can help
you out with this investigation?

12:56.415 --> 12:59.726
I just want my kids to feel comfortable
and safe everywhere in our house.

12:59.727 --> 13:02.997
Nathan is not really comfortable
going in the basement by himself.

13:02.998 --> 13:05.800
Melissa is not real comfortable
with the attic at all.

13:05.801 --> 13:07.268
- The attic?
- Right.

13:07.269 --> 13:10.245
- She didn't mention the attic.
- There's an attic out here in the hallway.

13:10.246 --> 13:13.726
- Can you show me?
- Yeah.

13:21.805 --> 13:24.610
What's the story? Why does
Melissa not like going up here?

13:24.611 --> 13:27.847
Just kind of a dark, creepy thing.
She's just not real comfortable.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.782
I don't think she's
ever been up here once.

13:29.783 --> 13:31.850
Right, and do you know
much about the house?

13:31.851 --> 13:33.486
I know it was built back in the '40s.

13:33.487 --> 13:36.555
Before there was a house on the
land, it was owned by John Looney,

13:36.556 --> 13:40.756
and he was a gangster back in
the '20s to '40s in Rock Island.

13:40.757 --> 13:43.095
Okay. Let me ask you a
question, though, Mike.

13:43.096 --> 13:47.367
If at the end of our investigation Amy
turns around and says, you know what?

13:47.368 --> 13:50.824
You can't fix this. You got to get
out of this house, what would you do?

13:50.825 --> 13:52.221
That would be hard for me.

13:52.222 --> 13:55.002
You know, as the husband
and the father of the house,

13:55.003 --> 13:57.806
I want to be able to find the answers,

13:57.807 --> 14:00.538
to stop my daughter from screaming
in the middle of the night.

14:00.539 --> 14:03.855
So I'm hoping having you guys out here,
we'll be able to find some sort of answer.

14:03.856 --> 14:05.776
Okay.

14:13.427 --> 14:18.163
A lot of the people that
are in the kids' area...

14:18.164 --> 14:22.458
They kind of live up
here or hang out up here.

14:22.459 --> 14:25.425
But they all kind of work together.

14:25.426 --> 14:29.986
And they died in
various ways and places.

14:33.279 --> 14:36.639
[Bleep] This is not good.

14:43.790 --> 14:45.890
So, Nathan, I was talking
to mom and dad before.

14:45.891 --> 14:48.733
They told me that you've been
experiencing some stuff in the house here?

14:48.734 --> 14:50.830
- Uh-huh.
- Explain that to me.

14:50.831 --> 14:53.165
I was in my bed, looking at the closet.

14:53.166 --> 14:57.369
I saw, like, a gray
shadow running across it.

14:57.370 --> 15:01.979
- Which closet... the one outside?
- Over there.

15:01.980 --> 15:05.811
- Can you make out what it was?
- It was kind of a person shadow.

15:05.812 --> 15:09.125
- All right. So, did that scare you?
- It scared me a lot.

15:09.126 --> 15:13.340
Just tried not to think
of it and have a nightmare.

15:13.341 --> 15:17.456
- Okay. Did you tell anybody about it?
- No, I haven't yet.

15:17.457 --> 15:19.658
You haven't? Okay.

15:19.659 --> 15:21.794
So, anything else happen?

15:21.795 --> 15:24.797
I felt someone trying
to pull me downstairs.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.844
- Down in the basement?
- Mm-hmm.

15:26.845 --> 15:30.002
- How?
- Like, grabbing onto my shirt.

15:30.003 --> 15:32.571
I've been lied to by
seasoned sociopaths,

15:32.572 --> 15:35.908
and I can always see through their
lies, so when I'm talking to a kid,

15:35.909 --> 15:38.878
I know when they're telling
me the truth, and this one is.

15:38.879 --> 15:41.527
Are you scared to be at home?

15:41.528 --> 15:43.388
Yes.

15:44.651 --> 15:49.930
The ones that are coming in
here, they can get kind of nasty.

15:49.931 --> 15:52.945
They more look like shadows...

15:52.946 --> 15:56.328
But they, like, are
up against the walls.

15:56.329 --> 15:58.998
Two groups of dead people
are roaming this structure...

15:58.999 --> 16:02.469
The ones presenting themselves
to the mediums who live here.

16:02.470 --> 16:06.104
And the ones crawling across the floors
of the basement and Master Bedroom.

16:06.105 --> 16:10.077
They have one thing in common...
they both have bad intentions.

16:10.078 --> 16:13.076
Is there anything else these
people can do to the living?

16:13.077 --> 16:18.977
You see them out of the corner
of your eye, but you feel them.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.780
What will these things eventually do?

16:21.781 --> 16:24.781
Well, they can kill.

16:41.365 --> 16:43.967
Mike told me that a mobster
used to own his land,

16:43.968 --> 16:48.371
so I made some calls, and
it turns out he's right.

16:48.372 --> 16:52.477
Going to meet with a local author who
says a guy by the name of John Looney

16:52.478 --> 16:58.378
used to run a bloody empire right
off of Mike and Melissa's property.

17:03.872 --> 17:07.057
So, you wrote this book about
Looney, and from what I understand,

17:07.058 --> 17:10.459
he actually owned the property
that I'm investigating.

17:10.460 --> 17:12.097
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

17:12.098 --> 17:15.709
This is John Looney about the
time he came to Rock Island.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.234
In the late 1800s...

17:18.236 --> 17:21.198
He met a woman named Nora O'Connor.

17:21.199 --> 17:25.017
They got married, and they
had two daughters and a son.

17:25.018 --> 17:26.219
Okay.

17:26.220 --> 17:29.316
But about 1903, his wife dies.

17:29.317 --> 17:31.791
And after she left...

17:31.792 --> 17:35.228
He spiraled downward
into this life of crime.

17:35.229 --> 17:38.421
He was involved in gambling, moonshine.

17:38.422 --> 17:41.015
He was involved in prostitution.

17:41.016 --> 17:45.386
This is Looney from sort
of the height of his power.

17:45.387 --> 17:47.689
How powerful did this guy get?

17:47.690 --> 17:50.959
Well, he basically controlled the town.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.844
People were very afraid of him.

17:52.845 --> 17:56.025
Basically if there was something
going on in town that was illegal,

17:56.026 --> 17:58.169
Looney was involved with it.

17:58.170 --> 18:00.300
Okay. Now, I assume
he was a violent man.

18:00.301 --> 18:02.485
Well, we know that a lot of people died,

18:02.486 --> 18:07.844
and Looney had people on his payroll who
were, you know, basically paid hit men.

18:07.845 --> 18:10.696
Do we know if he ever buried
any bodies on the property?

18:10.697 --> 18:13.598
Just the fact that he
had, you know, this large,

18:13.599 --> 18:19.499
piece of land with nobody living
around it, the opportunity existed.

18:21.872 --> 18:24.923
There's, like, a family out there...

18:24.924 --> 18:30.824
You know, like, a mother, a father,
I think like two or three kids.

18:34.885 --> 18:39.505
But their father...
he's kind of freaky...

18:39.523 --> 18:42.382
Kind of creepy-looking, too...

18:42.383 --> 18:45.443
Dressed all in black.

18:47.364 --> 18:51.984
I'm getting something
about dirty dealings.

18:52.419 --> 18:54.081
What does he do?

18:54.082 --> 18:57.562
He's, like, burying bodies.

19:01.212 --> 19:05.048
So, it was about 1922 and Looney's
empire started to fall apart.

19:05.049 --> 19:06.382
In what way?

19:06.383 --> 19:09.853
There had been a big split
in Looney's organization.

19:09.854 --> 19:12.511
Some of his former lieutenants
who'd formed their own gang

19:12.512 --> 19:14.891
basically set up a hit on Looney.

19:14.892 --> 19:17.435
They didn't get him,
but they got his son.

19:17.436 --> 19:19.372
Was he there when the son got shot?

19:19.373 --> 19:21.287
- Yes.
- He was?

19:21.288 --> 19:23.369
Basically they pulled up
in front of this hotel.

19:23.370 --> 19:27.203
Looney was going in to get some
papers, and these other guys pull up...

19:27.204 --> 19:31.074
Or they jump out and open fire,
and Looney runs for the hotel,

19:31.075 --> 19:33.409
goes up on the second floor,
and starts firing back,

19:33.410 --> 19:37.408
but the son gets shot down on the
sidewalk before he ever got to the door.

19:37.409 --> 19:41.969
And eventually dies
later at the hospital.

19:50.294 --> 19:54.063
Uh-oh. I just got a nasty headache.

19:54.064 --> 19:58.324
And someone's yelling about a gunshot.

19:59.347 --> 20:02.638
I do feel like there's
a hole in my head.

20:07.577 --> 20:11.247
There's, like, blood and then confusion.

20:11.248 --> 20:15.268
Like, I don't know if they lived.

20:15.719 --> 20:19.773
After his son was murdered,
things just sort of fell apart.

20:19.774 --> 20:22.865
The city leaders started to shut
down the gambling parlors and the

20:22.866 --> 20:26.312
hotels and the houses of prostitution
and started arresting people.

20:26.313 --> 20:29.032
And when the whole
house of cards fell in,

20:29.033 --> 20:32.105
the Feds went after
him and he was arrested.

20:32.106 --> 20:35.738
And then subsequently, they
filed murder charges against him

20:35.739 --> 20:38.874
for the murder of a local
bar owner named Bill Gabel,

20:38.875 --> 20:43.255
who refused to pay him protection money.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.144
He was eventually found guilty.

20:46.145 --> 20:49.919
He ended up sentenced to 14 years
for the murder and served 8 of it.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.066
Where did he wind up when
he came out of prison?

20:52.067 --> 20:54.414
Well, his daughter picks him
up at the prison gate and,

20:54.415 --> 20:57.097
he goes to live with her
and her husband in Texas.

20:57.098 --> 21:02.631
And he's there about eight years, and then
he ends up dying from a lung condition.

21:02.632 --> 21:04.570
And how old was he when he died?

21:04.571 --> 21:07.511
He was 75 in 1942.

21:08.064 --> 21:09.984
Okay.

21:17.022 --> 21:19.191
This guy dressed all in black...

21:19.192 --> 21:23.512
He's probably, like, in his early 70s.

21:23.730 --> 21:27.266
He's fairly recent... he's
fairly recently dead or something.

21:27.267 --> 21:30.201
But I keep seeing these
bodies all over the place.

21:30.202 --> 21:36.102
He's, like, digging them and just
throwing them in the ground, you know?

21:37.548 --> 21:40.033
Nobody likes him.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.494
He was evil.

21:43.492 --> 21:48.352
He definitely was not
involved in good things.

22:02.140 --> 22:04.681
I'm at the library to see
if anyone else of interest

22:04.682 --> 22:08.017
owned my clients' property
before John Looney.

22:08.018 --> 22:11.280
Digging through the archives, I
discover a man named Sam Bowles,

22:11.281 --> 22:14.424
who lived on the property in
the 1800s with his wife, Eliza.

22:14.425 --> 22:18.433
But what really caught my attention is
the headline surrounding their marriage.

22:18.434 --> 22:22.571
Turns out Eliza went to the newspapers
to make their troubles public.

22:22.572 --> 22:26.232
Claiming her husband beat her.

22:27.104 --> 22:29.273
I'm no expert on the 19th century,

22:29.274 --> 22:32.176
but I don't think it was real common
for women to go to the newspaper,

22:32.177 --> 22:34.347
claiming their husbands abused them.

22:34.348 --> 22:36.506
I'm on my way to meet
with a local historian

22:36.507 --> 22:41.487
who promises to tell me
the rest of the story.

22:47.124 --> 22:50.196
I thought it strange that
in 1886, a woman would

22:50.197 --> 22:52.329
actually go to the paper
about domestic violence.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.961
That wasn't common back then, was it?

22:53.962 --> 22:55.961
- No, absolutely not.
- Okay.

22:55.962 --> 22:57.890
Domestic violence was a
taboo subject back then.

22:57.891 --> 22:59.932
You typically didn't read
about it in the newspaper,

22:59.933 --> 23:02.124
and you wouldn't have talked
to your family about it.

23:02.125 --> 23:05.938
Now, Bobbi, you mentioned on the phone that
there was a little bit more to the story.

23:05.939 --> 23:11.839
One week after that was published in
the newspaper, Eliza died of a stroke.

23:13.580 --> 23:14.847
Do you know if she was sick?

23:14.848 --> 23:17.540
No, she wasn't. It was a sudden death.

23:17.541 --> 23:19.771
Okay. Did they have any
children, the two of them?

23:19.772 --> 23:24.512
Yes, they actually had
one daughter, Telitha.

23:26.626 --> 23:29.088
She was born in 1861.

23:29.089 --> 23:31.497
Okay, now, what kind of guy was Samuel?

23:31.498 --> 23:33.911
He was a very prominent
man in his community.

23:33.912 --> 23:38.282
He actually had built them a school, a
church, and a cemetery for its citizens.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.507
So, Bobbi, what ended up
happening with this guy?

23:40.508 --> 23:43.082
He actually died in 1893.

23:43.083 --> 23:46.192
And Telitha inherited his estate.

23:46.193 --> 23:48.000
She sold it off piece by piece,

23:48.001 --> 23:53.461
and eventually the last
piece was sold to John Looney.

23:55.355 --> 23:58.415
I'm seeing a female.

24:01.027 --> 24:04.747
She is kind of prissy, uppity.

24:05.031 --> 24:09.626
She's wearing a very lacy
dress, comes all the way up.

24:09.627 --> 24:15.087
I think that her parents
might have died pretty young.

24:18.494 --> 24:23.675
And she's disgusted by the
people she's surrounded by.

24:23.676 --> 24:26.195
This house is crawling with dead people.

24:26.196 --> 24:30.833
And what has me disturbed is their
attraction to the children's rooms.

24:30.834 --> 24:33.626
She's just very...

24:33.627 --> 24:35.787
Advanced.

24:38.381 --> 24:41.734
During my research, I also
discovered that before Samuel Bowles,

24:41.735 --> 24:46.896
Native Americans lived all over
what's now my clients' property.

24:46.897 --> 24:49.555
In this part of the country,
that's no big surprise.

24:49.556 --> 24:52.878
But when I called the local Curator
of the Native American museum,

24:52.879 --> 24:58.779
she said that what went down
there may be helpful to my case.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.021
So, I understand the
property I'm investigating

25:07.022 --> 25:08.661
used to be Native American territory?

25:08.662 --> 25:11.149
- That's correct.
- Okay. What can you tell me about it?

25:11.150 --> 25:16.019
Well, the last tribe of Indians to inhabit
that area were the Sauk Nation of Indians,

25:16.020 --> 25:20.717
and they were here from about
1735 and was about 5,000 people.

25:20.718 --> 25:22.908
Okay, so, what happened
with the Indians there?

25:22.909 --> 25:26.879
They lost their land to the
American government in 1804,

25:26.880 --> 25:30.430
but only about two-thirds of
the tribe was willing to go.

25:30.431 --> 25:34.653
About one-third of the tribe, that
was led by the warrior Black Hawk.

25:34.654 --> 25:37.456
Refused to leave the
land of their ancestors.

25:37.457 --> 25:42.077
Black Hawk said, I'll
die before I leave.

25:43.129 --> 25:47.933
But one of their spokesmen
was a man named Keokuk...

25:47.934 --> 25:52.254
Who was very friendly to the Americans.

25:52.331 --> 25:55.540
He was able to convince his own people,

25:55.541 --> 25:58.190
that there was no point in
fighting the American government

25:58.191 --> 26:00.846
and it was better to just
move as they were told.

26:00.847 --> 26:03.851
What about the people that didn't
support him, how did they feel about him?

26:03.852 --> 26:06.419
Well, they felt that he was a coward...

26:06.420 --> 26:08.854
A traitor to their nation.

26:08.855 --> 26:12.966
Black Hawk felt nothing
but disdain for him.

26:12.967 --> 26:17.763
So, the people that sided with Keokuk,
did they prosper with the deal he made?

26:17.764 --> 26:20.702
Well, no, they were
removed over into Iowa...

26:20.703 --> 26:23.637
And told that they
could live there forever.

26:23.638 --> 26:27.439
But within 10 years of
this promise, they're gone.

26:27.440 --> 26:32.240
- They lost everything?
- They lost everything.

26:34.199 --> 26:39.815
I'm seeing this leader guy
again, who's wearing a cloak.

26:39.816 --> 26:45.160
And he says, they're still our
territories and we still watch over them.

26:45.161 --> 26:48.191
But when he was alive, he screwed up.

26:48.192 --> 26:51.493
He wasn't doing his job.

26:51.494 --> 26:54.111
He says that everybody who's come since

26:54.112 --> 26:58.834
has just [Bleep] everything
up and destroyed it.

26:58.835 --> 27:03.094
He feels justified as far
as wreaking havoc on people.

27:03.095 --> 27:04.935
What does he do?

27:04.936 --> 27:10.836
Basically whatever needs to be done,
but he sends his people in to do it.

27:13.405 --> 27:14.888
What do you mean?

27:14.889 --> 27:19.269
The people that he puts in the trees...

27:19.692 --> 27:21.941
Were from his time...

27:21.942 --> 27:24.762
Like 17-something.

27:27.601 --> 27:31.673
When he sends people into the house...

27:31.674 --> 27:34.794
Why is he doing that?

27:36.677 --> 27:41.657
That's him trying to
get rid of this building.

28:06.151 --> 28:09.873
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations.

28:09.874 --> 28:15.774
We're ready to reveal our findings to each
other and our clients for the first time.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.435
Mike and Melissa have
been here about five years.

28:18.436 --> 28:21.991
Melissa's had experiences
from the minute they came here.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.835
They have two beautiful children,

28:23.836 --> 28:26.738
and one of their kids is
having a very tough time here.

28:26.739 --> 28:30.347
Waking up in the middle of the night,
screaming, crying. She's afraid to be here.

28:30.348 --> 28:34.161
So they're concerned if their kids
can live here in a safe environment,

28:34.162 --> 28:36.810
and that's why they called us in.

28:36.811 --> 28:39.946
With that, I'm gonna have Amy
start to talk about her walk.

28:39.947 --> 28:42.417
I immediately get the
sense that someone here

28:42.418 --> 28:45.219
is contributing to what's
happening in this house.

28:45.220 --> 28:49.245
But I can also tell they're not
emotionally ready to hear it yet.

28:49.246 --> 28:52.579
One of the first people that
I encountered was a male.

28:52.580 --> 28:55.119
He's not a good guy.

28:55.120 --> 28:56.697
He was dressed all in black.

28:56.698 --> 28:59.599
I did get that while he was
alive, he was particularly evil.

28:59.600 --> 29:03.770
And he definitely was not
involved in anything good.

29:03.771 --> 29:06.072
Who do you guys think it sounds like?

29:06.073 --> 29:07.996
- John Looney.
- John Looney?

29:07.997 --> 29:13.152
John Looney was a gangster that
owned this property back in the 1920s.

29:13.153 --> 29:17.450
He was involved in everything...
prostitution, gambling, bootlegging.

29:17.451 --> 29:21.289
He was supposedly very ruthless...
got convicted of murder.

29:21.290 --> 29:25.292
He was suspected in
many, many more deaths.

29:25.293 --> 29:28.928
There's pictures of him here.

29:28.929 --> 29:31.269
Interesting.

29:38.272 --> 29:43.169
I think his reason for buying the property
up here was because it was perfect for...

29:43.170 --> 29:46.145
- Burying bodies... great.
- Burying bodies.

29:46.146 --> 29:48.674
Now, you think the guy you saw was him?

29:48.675 --> 29:51.735
Looks like him, yeah.

29:54.255 --> 29:56.221
What else did you see?

29:56.222 --> 30:01.528
Well, then I saw something out
back which was pretty freaky.

30:01.529 --> 30:04.747
Under the trees are all these people.

30:04.748 --> 30:09.488
And all of them used
to live on this land.

30:09.637 --> 30:12.710
And their leader was
this man who came up.

30:12.711 --> 30:16.610
He walked up, and he
was wearing a dark cloak.

30:16.611 --> 30:22.511
And I got that this guy was from
a very long time ago, like 1700s.

30:22.757 --> 30:28.035
He feels that his job was to be
in charge of a large territory.

30:28.036 --> 30:31.847
And he screwed up. He
just made a big mistake.

30:31.848 --> 30:34.464
And now that he's dead he,

30:34.465 --> 30:38.626
does an incredible job of
watching his territories...

30:38.627 --> 30:41.447
Psychotically too well.

30:41.448 --> 30:42.856
It's interesting you say that.

30:42.857 --> 30:47.798
There was a tribe of Indians called the
Sauk Nation that inhabited your land.

30:47.799 --> 30:50.877
There was an Indian
by the name of Keokuk.

30:50.878 --> 30:53.925
And when the white men came,
he kind of appeased them...

30:53.926 --> 30:56.528
And kind of played
both sides of the coin.

30:56.529 --> 31:02.429
He basically sold out the whole Indian
nation here and had them displaced.

31:02.743 --> 31:05.383
This is Keokuk.

31:08.262 --> 31:13.374
Even to this day, that tribe
feels he sold the whole tribe out.

31:13.375 --> 31:19.275
Well, it kind of makes sense, because what
this person wants is the house to be gone.

31:21.418 --> 31:25.033
He said he's not the only one
who watches this territory.

31:25.034 --> 31:28.782
He'll send other people to,
like, take care of business.

31:28.783 --> 31:31.194
Now, did you see any of those
people inside this house?

31:31.195 --> 31:34.400
There was a lot of them
in The Master Bedroom.

31:34.401 --> 31:38.591
On the floor, around the bed basically.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.092
Some of them can't walk.

31:40.093 --> 31:45.264
Some of them can only crawl
or, like, pull themselves.

31:45.265 --> 31:47.970
Tell Amy about Madison, what she saw.

31:47.971 --> 31:50.014
She was sleeping with
me in bed one night.

31:50.015 --> 31:53.973
She said she didn't want to go to
sleep because of the man under the bed.

31:53.974 --> 31:56.176
And I said, well, there's
no man under the bed.

31:56.177 --> 31:59.740
And she goes, yes,
mommy, he's under there.

31:59.741 --> 32:02.267
And then she got down
and looked under the bed,

32:02.268 --> 32:04.364
and I said, see, there's
no one under there.

32:04.365 --> 32:07.851
She started pointing, and she
said, mommy, he's right there.

32:07.852 --> 32:11.053
That thing with the bed... you had told
me about you were laying in bed alone.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.000
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell Amy about that, too.

32:13.001 --> 32:17.059
Yeah, I had just gotten into bed, and
I felt somebody sit down on the bed,

32:17.060 --> 32:20.196
so I turned to look and
there's nothing there.

32:20.197 --> 32:24.042
And then I felt it... whatever
it was... get up off the bed.

32:24.043 --> 32:26.845
Would that have been what you were
talking about in The Master Bedroom?

32:26.846 --> 32:29.813
- Doing that to the bed?
- Um, probably not.

32:29.814 --> 32:32.814
That's probably him.

32:35.813 --> 32:39.053
I just got goose bumps.

32:40.736 --> 32:42.766
So, what else is going on?

32:42.767 --> 32:45.812
Then I went down to the basement.

32:45.813 --> 32:49.039
And uh, I saw some of
the specific dead people

32:49.040 --> 32:53.643
that I think were sent
to destroy your house.

32:53.644 --> 32:58.014
They're all naked, they're all in
different levels of decomposition.

32:58.015 --> 33:00.349
And I think two of them want help.

33:00.350 --> 33:04.487
I actually saw somebody
doing laundry, a female.

33:04.488 --> 33:09.559
This was a living person, and one
of them was crawling on the floor.

33:09.560 --> 33:13.576
And was actually trying to
grab the person's pant leg.

33:13.577 --> 33:17.774
Yeah, there's something
about that laundry room.

33:17.775 --> 33:21.330
I feel like I'm always being watched.

33:21.331 --> 33:24.734
Nathan had another incident in the
basement here, going up the stairs.

33:24.735 --> 33:26.309
Tell Amy about that.

33:26.310 --> 33:30.726
He was walking up the stairs, and then he
felt a little tug on the back of his shirt.

33:30.727 --> 33:32.223
Okay. Interesting.

33:32.224 --> 33:34.985
And do you think this would be one
of these people that tugged on him?

33:34.986 --> 33:36.846
Yes.

33:37.638 --> 33:39.923
Let me ask you something. You
said you saw a living woman?

33:39.924 --> 33:42.663
- That's what you saw?
- Mm-hmm. Well, I sketched it.

33:42.664 --> 33:45.148
- You sketched that scene you saw?
- Yes.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.549
She's gray.

33:49.000 --> 33:52.660
Her hair is all kind of wet.

33:52.662 --> 33:56.742
Her legs are kind of bent sideways.

34:03.705 --> 34:06.645
Wow. That's creepy.

34:09.072 --> 34:10.933
Wow.

34:18.795 --> 34:21.052
- That's pretty scary.
- It's sad.

34:21.053 --> 34:25.313
It's just so uneasy for me in there.

34:27.431 --> 34:32.592
Maybe this person is
reaching out to me for help.

34:33.085 --> 34:35.945
Why would they be reaching
out to Melissa for help?

34:35.946 --> 34:39.047
I did get that there was someone
here who brings in the dead.

34:39.047 --> 34:42.059
There is a female who they
think is a medium here.

34:42.060 --> 34:47.219
So, when you are a medium, dead people
are attracted to you who want help.

34:47.221 --> 34:51.523
And I did get that this individual doesn't
quite know what to do with this ability.

34:51.524 --> 34:55.353
There is a slight unhealthy
attraction to death.

34:55.353 --> 34:57.647
Like an obsession with it.

34:57.648 --> 35:01.746
It's dangerous because
there's a fine line there.

35:01.747 --> 35:07.267
And a lot of the dead here
can inadvertently harm you.

35:25.421 --> 35:31.026
I did get that there was someone
here who brings in the dead.

35:31.027 --> 35:36.927
There is a slight unhealthy attraction
to death, like an obsession with it.

35:38.150 --> 35:44.050
It's dangerous, and a lot of the
dead here can inadvertently harm you.

35:46.626 --> 35:49.711
Well, when I first started
interviewing Melissa,

35:49.712 --> 35:54.067
she had told me that she's had
experiences since she was a kid.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.954
I always felt like I had
had psychic abilities,

35:56.955 --> 36:01.752
but I had never really been
afraid of my experiences.

36:01.753 --> 36:02.785
Mm-hmm.

36:02.786 --> 36:06.899
Now that my daughter had been
really, really frightened.

36:06.900 --> 36:09.364
I was like, okay, there's
something going on,

36:09.365 --> 36:12.342
and we need to get this taken care of.

36:12.343 --> 36:14.904
Now, you believe this stuff gets
passed down through generations.

36:14.905 --> 36:16.360
Oh, absolutely, yeah.

36:16.361 --> 36:21.235
And the other thing was getting that there
was a child who's extremely open here.

36:21.236 --> 36:26.396
And very well developed,
which is very interesting.

36:26.518 --> 36:32.377
When I went into their bedroom,
the dead lined up and greeted me.

36:32.378 --> 36:34.322
It's a type of introduction.

36:34.323 --> 36:39.585
Usually this is, like, for, you
know, really advanced mediums.

36:39.586 --> 36:43.065
- So I was, like, shocked.
- And you saw this in Nathan's room?

36:43.066 --> 36:46.070
I don't know. It had
the bunk beds, I think.

36:46.071 --> 36:49.611
Yeah, that's Nathan's room.

36:49.730 --> 36:51.942
I feel like Mike and
Melissa have always known,

36:51.943 --> 36:54.042
that something wasn't
right in their home.

36:54.043 --> 36:57.011
They've just been too afraid
to admit it to each other.

36:57.012 --> 36:59.831
I think your daughter has
something going on, too.

36:59.832 --> 37:05.592
But right now, he is way more
advanced than your daughter.

37:06.258 --> 37:10.878
It makes sense, with
him not being afraid.

37:11.970 --> 37:14.162
This is Nathan.

37:14.163 --> 37:16.443
Aw. Cutie!

37:17.445 --> 37:21.705
Has anything traumatic happened to him?

37:23.573 --> 37:25.607
Nathan was about 2 years old.

37:25.608 --> 37:29.508
We had another son, named Noah...

37:29.633 --> 37:30.941
Okay.

37:30.942 --> 37:35.683
And he actually passed
away shortly after birth.

37:35.684 --> 37:37.738
I have Noah's picture.
Can I show that to Amy?

37:37.739 --> 37:40.555
- Is that all right?
- Sure.

37:40.556 --> 37:42.268
This is right before he passed.

37:42.269 --> 37:44.069
Aw.

37:49.265 --> 37:52.567
We knew something was wrong
halfway through the pregnancy.

37:52.568 --> 37:55.148
So, you guys were preparing
for this before, even.

37:55.149 --> 37:57.571
I never prepared for it.

37:57.572 --> 38:01.952
I didn't accept that he wouldn't live.

38:08.351 --> 38:11.520
Now that I know about Noah,
it all makes sense to me.

38:11.521 --> 38:17.421
So, the last thing was a little
bit of poltergeist going on here.

38:17.627 --> 38:19.894
I felt things were
sliding across the floor.

38:19.895 --> 38:24.334
I felt that the adult
medium won't let go,

38:24.335 --> 38:26.468
specifically to the family and friends.

38:26.469 --> 38:30.438
And this is kind of something
that is being held inside.

38:30.439 --> 38:34.363
And is coming out in this manner.

38:34.364 --> 38:37.672
And I think this person has some anger.

38:37.673 --> 38:41.873
And it's not being properly released.

38:44.220 --> 38:47.220
That sound like you?

38:57.300 --> 38:58.800
Sorry.

38:58.801 --> 39:01.141
It's okay.

39:03.794 --> 39:07.707
I've had other people tell me that...

39:07.708 --> 39:11.968
I haven't grieved properly for Noah...

39:14.860 --> 39:17.860
So that makes sense.

39:19.088 --> 39:22.151
I can't think of um...

39:22.152 --> 39:26.232
Anything I've noticed, like, moving.

39:27.920 --> 39:31.008
The one thing that I've found
unexplainable in this house

39:31.009 --> 39:33.186
since I've been living here is a,

39:33.187 --> 39:36.762
shopping cart that Madison has in
her room, a little toy shopping cart.

39:36.763 --> 39:41.513
It was parallel to her bed at one point,
full of toys, when she was younger.

39:41.514 --> 39:44.008
And she woke up screaming. I
came into her room, and it was

39:44.009 --> 39:45.835
- turned and in the middle of the room.
- Hmm.

39:45.836 --> 39:47.716
No way she could've pushed it there...

39:47.717 --> 39:48.761
Mm-hmm.

39:48.762 --> 39:51.906
And so I put it back, and then she woke
up screaming about a half-hour later,

39:51.907 --> 39:54.188
and it was, again, turned
and in the middle of the room.

39:54.189 --> 39:57.976
Interesting. That's
a pretty big movement.

39:57.977 --> 40:00.278
Could that be from the poltergeist?

40:00.279 --> 40:02.139
Yes.

40:11.046 --> 40:13.213
Melissa, I know tonight
was pretty rough.

40:13.214 --> 40:17.376
You heard a lot of things that
you probably didn't want to hear.

40:17.377 --> 40:19.720
But the big question is your children.

40:19.721 --> 40:22.282
- Right.
- Is it safe for them to be raised here?

40:22.283 --> 40:27.083
With that, I'm gonna
turn that over to Amy.

40:31.559 --> 40:35.992
You have a lot of dead
around this location.

40:35.993 --> 40:39.165
So the first thing you need
to do is grief counseling.

40:39.166 --> 40:41.401
This is going to allow
you to let go of the dead

40:41.402 --> 40:44.837
and to process emotions
in a beneficial way.

40:44.838 --> 40:48.091
This will also help you
get rid of the poltergeist.

40:48.092 --> 40:52.099
For Nathan, something he should do
every night before he goes to bed,

40:52.100 --> 40:54.539
is to have him state that,

40:54.540 --> 40:59.124
he only allows the good dead and
guides to stand by him and help him.

40:59.125 --> 41:01.107
He has that power,

41:01.108 --> 41:06.327
and the good guides and the good dead are
going to be pushing the bad out, as well.

41:06.328 --> 41:10.948
- Will that get Looney out of here?
- Yes.

41:12.872 --> 41:16.735
The last thing is you
can go to the tribe...

41:16.736 --> 41:22.636
That Keokuk is from, and ask them
to do a ceremony in your backyard.

41:23.035 --> 41:28.315
To release him and the
people that he's imprisoned.

41:28.716 --> 41:30.357
I feel really good about it.

41:30.358 --> 41:34.331
I'm anxious to start
helping Nathan and...

41:34.332 --> 41:38.352
Get rid of these negative energies.

41:40.294 --> 41:42.925
We have a game plan now. For
me, I feel like a puzzle has

41:42.926 --> 41:45.131
been put together in front
of me, to be honest with you.

41:45.132 --> 41:46.800
But are you gonna follow Amy's advice?

41:46.801 --> 41:48.134
Definitely. Yeah.

41:48.135 --> 41:50.415
Absolutely.

41:52.573 --> 41:54.607
Melissa has a lot of work ahead of her

41:54.608 --> 41:57.958
to rid her property of
the evil that resides here.

41:57.959 --> 42:01.383
But once she confronts her
past and follows my advice.

42:01.384 --> 42:07.284
I'm confident that her family
will be able to live in peace.
