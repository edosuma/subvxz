WEBVTT

00:10.353 --> 00:13.841
OK. MOVE IT OR LOSE IT,
PEOPLE. COMIN' THROUGH.HEY,
I WAS USING THAT.

00:13.941 --> 00:15.928
YEAH, WELL, I'M LATE
AND I NEED CAFFEINE,
SO SUE ME.

00:16.027 --> 00:18.179
2 WEEKS OF JURY DUTY

00:18.279 --> 00:19.933
AND SUDDENLY
SHE'S LAWYERY.

00:20.033 --> 00:21.936
YOU KNOW, NORMALLY,
I WOULD HAVE A WITTY
COMEBACK FOR THAT,

00:22.036 --> 00:24.187
BUT I AM TOO TIRED.

00:24.287 --> 00:26.483
I'D BE TIRED, TOO,
IF I HAD TO DECIDE

00:26.583 --> 00:29.361
WHETHER OR NOT
SOMEONE LIVED
OR DIED.WHAT'S
YOUR DECISION?

00:29.461 --> 00:30.738
PAIGE, YOU KNOW I CAN'T
TALK ABOUT THE CASE.

00:30.838 --> 00:34.159
BESIDES, THAT'S NOT
WHY I CAN'T SLEEP.

00:34.260 --> 00:36.955
I CAN'T SLEEP BECAUSE
I MISS COLE TOO MUCH.

00:37.055 --> 00:39.290
IF HE DOESN'T COME HOME
SOON, I'M GONNA TURN
INTO A VAMPIRE.

00:39.390 --> 00:41.919
JOKES LIKE THAT
IN THIS HOUSE,
NOT SO FUNNY.

00:42.020 --> 00:44.172
NOT SO FUNNY.

00:44.272 --> 00:45.352
SO WHEN DO YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA COME BACK?

00:45.362 --> 00:46.926
WHO KNOWS?

00:47.026 --> 00:48.218
HE SAID HE NEEDED
SOME TIME TO FIND HIMSELF,

00:48.318 --> 00:50.220
FIGURE OUT WHO HE WAS
WITHOUT HIS DEMON SIDE.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.101
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HE'S OFF BANGING ON
DRUMS IN THE WOODS?

00:53.201 --> 00:55.495
GOD, I HOPE NOT.

00:56.329 --> 00:58.332
OH, GOTTA GO.

00:59.792 --> 01:00.694
WAIT!

01:00.794 --> 01:01.695
WHO'S TESTIFYING
TODAY?

01:01.795 --> 01:04.197
NOBODY.
IT'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.491
ALREADY?
THAT WAS FAST.

01:05.591 --> 01:07.119
OH, NO. NOT YOU, TOO.

01:07.219 --> 01:08.720
OH, COME ON, PHOEBE.
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO BE CURIOUS.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.766
FORGET IT.

01:13.102 --> 01:14.346
LISTEN. NOBODY KEEPS
SECRETS BETTER THAN US.

01:14.356 --> 01:17.174
WE ARE THE MISTRESSES
OF SECRETS.

01:17.274 --> 01:19.509
WELL?

01:19.609 --> 01:20.510
WELL,

01:20.610 --> 01:22.013
LET'S JUST SAY
IT WOULD BE
MY SUPREME PLEASURE

01:22.113 --> 01:24.933
TO SEND THAT
MURDERING BASTARD
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

01:25.033 --> 01:27.937
BY LEGAL MEANS,
NOT MAGICAL.

01:28.037 --> 01:31.316
YOU MIGHT
ACTUALLY BE
THE FIRST PERSON

01:31.416 --> 01:34.237
WHO ENJOYS
JURY DUTY.

01:34.337 --> 01:36.322
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS?

01:36.422 --> 01:38.075
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE NICE FOR A CHANGE

01:38.175 --> 01:41.095
TO GET SOME KUDOS
FOR VANQUISHING THE BAD GUY.

01:41.804 --> 01:44.016
I MEAN, PUNISHING.

01:45.351 --> 01:47.212
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

01:47.312 --> 01:48.004
HEY.

01:48.105 --> 01:49.815
HEY. PAIGE HOME?

01:51.399 --> 01:52.735
YEAH, SHE IS.
BUT I'M NOT. BYE.

01:53.111 --> 01:54.821
GLEN, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.393
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

01:59.493 --> 02:01.021
I'M DONE WITH AUSTRALIA
FINALLY,

02:01.121 --> 02:02.773
AND I'M ACTUALLY
THINKING ABOUT NEPAL.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.317
I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY
AND SEE HOW YOU WERE DOING.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.419
SO GREAT TO SEE YOU.

02:07.671 --> 02:09.506
[CLEARS THROAT]

02:11.176 --> 02:12.245
OH, THAT'S
MY SISTER PIPER.

02:12.345 --> 02:14.288
OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

02:14.388 --> 02:15.330
HI.

02:15.430 --> 02:16.833
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'VE GOT SISTERS.

02:16.934 --> 02:18.627
YEAH, IT TAKES
SOME GETTING USED TO.

02:18.727 --> 02:20.855
SO, WHERE
ARE YOU STAYING?

02:22.439 --> 02:23.716
I DON'T KNOW YET,
ACTUALLY.

02:23.816 --> 02:26.344
GOOD.
YOU'LL STAY HERE.

02:26.444 --> 02:28.014
WHAT?

02:28.114 --> 02:29.474
YEAH, FIRST DOOR UP,
TOP OF THE STAIRS.

02:29.574 --> 02:30.935
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S ALL RIGHT?

02:31.035 --> 02:32.351
YEAH.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

02:32.452 --> 02:34.231
I'LL BE RIGHT UP.

02:34.331 --> 02:36.483
GREAT. THANK YOU.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.443
PAIGE.

02:38.543 --> 02:39.863
WHAT?

02:39.963 --> 02:42.364
I DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA IF
YOUR BOYFRIEND STAYS HERE.

02:42.464 --> 02:45.368
HE'S NOT
MY BOYFRIEND.

02:45.468 --> 02:48.165
WELL, SOMETIMES
HE'S MY BOYFRIEND,

02:48.265 --> 02:49.625
BUT MOSTLY,
HE'S JUST MY
REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

02:49.725 --> 02:51.376
UH, WELL, WE USUALLY
DON'T HAVE HOUSEGUESTS

02:51.476 --> 02:53.755
BECAUSE OF
ALL THE OBVIOUS REASONS.

02:53.855 --> 02:56.885
YOU CAN TRUST GLEN.

02:56.985 --> 02:58.385
HE'S BEEN MY FRIEND
SINCE,

02:58.485 --> 02:59.722
GOD, KINDERGARTEN.

02:59.822 --> 03:01.308
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN A WITCH
SINCE KINDERGARTEN,

03:01.408 --> 03:02.725
AND I DON'T THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND--

03:02.826 --> 03:04.185
I UNDERSTAND
THAT I ALSO
PAY RENT HERE.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.189
THERE IS NO RENT.

03:07.289 --> 03:08.398
IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

03:08.498 --> 03:10.152
NO, IT'S NOT.

03:10.252 --> 03:11.402
WELL, IT SHOULD BE.

03:11.502 --> 03:13.114
HMPH.

03:13.214 --> 03:14.157
THERE IS NO EXCUSE,

03:14.257 --> 03:17.119
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY.

03:17.219 --> 03:19.412
THE DEFENDANT
HAS NO ALIBI,

03:19.512 --> 03:21.958
NO CREDIBLE EXPLANATION

03:22.058 --> 03:24.337
FOR HOW HE WAS ABLE
TO LEAD THE POLICE

03:24.437 --> 03:26.421
DIRECTLY
TO HIS EX-WIFE'S BODY

03:26.521 --> 03:29.302
OTHER THAN HIS--

03:29.402 --> 03:30.719
HOW DID HE DESCRIBE IT?

03:30.820 --> 03:32.348
PSYCHIC VISION.

03:32.448 --> 03:35.184
NO.

03:35.284 --> 03:36.353
PREMONITION.

03:36.453 --> 03:38.436
THAT'S IT.

03:38.536 --> 03:40.106
THAT WAS HIS ALIBI.

03:40.207 --> 03:42.985
THAT'S WHAT MR. PROVAZOLLI
EXPECTS YOU TO BELIEVE

03:43.085 --> 03:46.990
TO COUNTER THE OVERWHELMING
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM,

03:47.090 --> 03:49.243
INCLUDING--

03:49.343 --> 03:50.245
WITH THE COURT'S PERMISSION?

03:50.345 --> 03:52.957
PEOPLE'S 17,

03:53.057 --> 03:54.457
THE MURDER WEAPON,

03:54.557 --> 03:55.961
ONE THAT
HE HAS ADMITTED TO USING

03:56.061 --> 03:58.462
IN HIS OWN MAGIC SHOW.

03:58.562 --> 04:00.549
AND THEN HE USED IT

04:00.649 --> 04:02.803
TO ROB ANGELA PROVAZOLLI

04:02.903 --> 04:05.348
OF HER LIFE.

04:05.448 --> 04:07.534
RETURN THE VERDICT
YOU KNOW YOU MUST--

04:07.867 --> 04:11.063
MURDER

04:11.163 --> 04:12.373
IN THE FIRST DEGREE.

04:22.010 --> 04:25.597
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MA'AM?

04:25.890 --> 04:27.476
Judge:
MA'AM, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:41.618 --> 04:45.065
âª I AM THE SON âª

04:45.165 --> 04:47.625
âª AND THE HEIR âª

04:48.627 --> 04:50.965
âª I AM HUMAN
AND I NEED TO BE LOVED âª

04:55.095 --> 04:58.891
âª JUST LIKE
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES âª

05:03.356 --> 05:07.319
âª SEE, I'VE ALREADY
WAITED TOO LONG âª

05:09.654 --> 05:13.451
âª AND ALL MY HOPE IS GONE âª

05:50.041 --> 05:53.195
HEY!

05:53.295 --> 05:54.738
HEY, I JUST GOT
A PREMONITION.

05:54.838 --> 05:56.698
WE'LL BE OUT
OF HERE IN TIME
FOR LUNCH.

05:56.798 --> 05:58.159
HA HA HA HA!

05:58.259 --> 05:59.661
OK, UH, WELL,
UH...

05:59.761 --> 06:01.956
I THINK THAT
THE PROPER PROCEDURE
IS, UH,

06:02.056 --> 06:03.749
THAT FIRST WE REVIEW
THE EVIDENCE--

06:03.849 --> 06:05.710
WELL, WE HEARD
THE EVIDENCE,

06:05.810 --> 06:07.213
SO LET'S JUST
TAKE A VOTE AND
GET OUT OF HERE.

06:07.313 --> 06:08.629
STILL, AS THE FOREMAN,

06:08.730 --> 06:10.133
IT'S MY JOB TO--
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR
OF GUILTY,

06:10.233 --> 06:11.652
ONE...

06:12.486 --> 06:13.388
2, 3, 4, 5,

06:13.488 --> 06:15.223
6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

06:15.323 --> 06:16.517
11...

06:16.617 --> 06:18.911
COME ON, LADY,
WHAT'S IT
GONNA BE?

06:21.121 --> 06:24.750
I HAVE TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.786
LEO!

06:32.887 --> 06:33.788
LEO!

06:33.888 --> 06:35.056
PHOEBE, WHAT?

06:36.016 --> 06:36.917
QUICK, ORB ME
TO THE MANOR.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.768
Paige: I THOUGHT
YOU SAID IT WAS
AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE.

06:40.939 --> 06:43.176
SO DID I, BUT THE KILLER
IN MY PREMONITION

06:43.276 --> 06:45.761
WAS DEFINITELY
NOT STAN PROVAZOLLI.

06:45.861 --> 06:48.223
OK, NOW,
I DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE,

06:48.323 --> 06:49.601
BUT HE HAD THIS TATTOO
ON HIS ARM

06:49.701 --> 06:50.935
LIKE A MEDUSA'S HEAD
WITH SNAKES.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.686
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

06:52.786 --> 06:54.689
WELL, I'M GONNA STALL
WHILE YOU GUYS
TRY TO GET DARRYL

06:54.789 --> 06:56.775
TO GET YOU IN
TO SEE STAN.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.694
DESCRIBE THE TATTOO.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.072
MAYBE HE KNOWS
THE REAL KILLER.

07:00.172 --> 07:01.574
I DON'T KNOW,

07:01.675 --> 07:02.699
HE MUST NOT HAVE SEEN HIM

07:02.799 --> 07:03.826
IN HIS PREMONITION,
OTHERWISE--

07:03.927 --> 07:05.078
WAIT, HE HAD
A PREMONITION?

07:05.178 --> 07:06.414
YEAH, THAT'S HOW
HE CLAIMS TO HAVE KNOWN

07:06.514 --> 07:07.705
WHERE THE BODY WAS.

07:07.806 --> 07:08.707
AND YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE,

07:08.807 --> 07:09.708
DID NOT
BELIEVE HIM?

07:09.808 --> 07:11.212
PIPER, HE'S
JUST A CLUB MAGICIAN.

07:11.312 --> 07:14.049
I ASSUMED
THAT HE WAS A FRAUD.

07:14.149 --> 07:15.716
BELIEVE ME, I FEEL
HORRIBLE ABOUT THIS.

07:15.816 --> 07:18.429
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL
FIX IT SOMEHOW.

07:18.529 --> 07:20.973
DO WE HUNT KILLERS

07:21.074 --> 07:22.725
THAT AREN'T DEMONS?

07:22.825 --> 07:23.869
WELL, I HAD THAT PREMONITION
FOR A REASON.

07:25.538 --> 07:28.651
JUST BECAUSE THE KILLER
ISN'T SUPERNATURAL--

07:28.751 --> 07:30.654
HEY THERE, GLEN!
HELLO!

07:30.754 --> 07:31.736
WHAT DID
YOU HEAR?

07:31.836 --> 07:33.658
EXCUSE ME?

07:33.758 --> 07:35.243
SHE SAID WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

07:35.343 --> 07:36.452
OH. I WAS JUST LOOKIN'
FOR THE KITCHEN.

07:36.552 --> 07:38.555
DIDN'T YOU--DIDN'T
YOU LEAVE ALREADY?

07:40.140 --> 07:41.833
YEAH! YEAH,
BUT NOW I'M BACK.

07:41.933 --> 07:43.795
BUT I'D BETTER
GET GOING AGAIN

07:43.895 --> 07:45.129
BEFORE SOMEBODY WONDERS
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

07:45.230 --> 07:47.757
I'LL, UH, JUST TAKE GLEN
TO THE KITCHEN

07:47.857 --> 07:50.111
AND SHOW HIM WHERE
TO MAKE A SAND...
UH... WITCH.

07:51.447 --> 07:52.198
IS HE STAYING HERE?

07:54.866 --> 07:56.270
MM-HMM.

07:56.370 --> 07:58.230
I THINK YOU NEED
TO TALK TO HER.

07:58.330 --> 07:59.565
I DID,
AND APPARENTLY
I WAS THE ONLY ONE

07:59.665 --> 08:01.918
PAYING ATTENTION.

08:02.795 --> 08:03.462
[SIGHS]

08:05.964 --> 08:07.367
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

08:07.467 --> 08:08.927
Juror:
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON IN THERE?

08:09.470 --> 08:10.887
COME ON,
OPEN THE DAMN DOOR!

08:13.057 --> 08:14.792
MAYBE
SOMETHING'S
WRONG.

08:14.892 --> 08:15.893
I'LL CALL
FOR THE BAILIFF.

08:17.105 --> 08:20.301
I...

08:20.401 --> 08:21.302
AM SO SORRY.

08:21.402 --> 08:22.762
IT'S...

08:22.862 --> 08:23.846
THAT TIME
OF THE MONTH.

08:23.946 --> 08:25.806
EWW.

08:25.906 --> 08:26.975
LOOK,

08:27.075 --> 08:28.102
THE REST OF US
FINISHED VOTING.

08:28.202 --> 08:29.395
11 GUILTY.

08:29.496 --> 08:30.522
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

08:30.622 --> 08:32.190
WELL...

08:32.289 --> 08:34.152
BEFORE I CAST MY VOTE,

08:34.251 --> 08:35.818
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL

08:35.919 --> 08:37.989
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY...

08:38.090 --> 08:39.591
THAT THE DEFENDANT
MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A PSYCHIC.

08:40.802 --> 08:43.121
WHAT?

08:43.221 --> 08:44.332
MMM.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.416
ALL HE IS GUILTY OF

08:45.516 --> 08:46.959
IS HAVING A SPECIAL GIFT.

08:47.059 --> 08:48.835
YOU'RE
THE FOREMAN.

08:48.936 --> 08:50.380
MAKE HER VOTE.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.424
NOT UNTIL
I REVIEW THE EVIDENCE.

08:51.524 --> 08:53.401
EVERY...SINGLE...PIECE.

09:01.286 --> 09:04.566
THANK YOU.

09:04.666 --> 09:05.525
SURE.

09:05.625 --> 09:06.902
SO, I HAVE
TO GO TO WORK,

09:07.002 --> 09:08.320
BUT IF YOU WANT,
YOU CAN DROP ME OFF

09:08.421 --> 09:09.862
AND THEN USE MY CAR.

09:09.963 --> 09:11.115
UH, NO. I'M WIPED.

09:11.215 --> 09:13.160
I'M JUST GONNA HANG
HERE IF IT'S COOL.

09:13.260 --> 09:14.453
OH.

09:14.553 --> 09:16.790
PAIGE, IS--IS
EVERYTHING OK?

09:16.890 --> 09:18.416
WHAT WAS GOING ON
IN THERE?

09:18.517 --> 09:19.752
OH, THAT?

09:19.852 --> 09:20.877
THAT'S JUST
A FAMILY MEETING, YOU KNOW,

09:20.977 --> 09:22.422
DECIDING WHO'S
GONNA TAKE OUT THE TRASH

09:22.522 --> 09:24.633
OR WHOSE TURN IT IS
TO CLEAN THE BATHROOM.

09:24.734 --> 09:26.884
WE TAKE IT ALL
VERY SERIOUSLY HERE.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.887
I HEARD WORDS
LIKE "KILLER"

09:28.987 --> 09:31.350
AND "SUPERNATURAL."

09:31.450 --> 09:32.892
IT DOESN'T
REALLY SOUND LIKE
HOUSEWORK TO ME.

09:32.992 --> 09:35.563
WE NEVER REALLY
COULD LIE TO EACH
OTHER VERY WELL.

09:35.664 --> 09:38.567
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S WHY
WE DIDN'T MAKE IT
AS A COUPLE.

09:38.667 --> 09:41.363
I'VE BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT YOU

09:41.463 --> 09:43.906
SINCE THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU

09:44.006 --> 09:44.907
JUST BEFORE YOU
MOVED IN HERE,

09:45.008 --> 09:46.662
AND THE VIBE THAT
I'VE BEEN GETTIN'

09:46.762 --> 09:47.954
SINCE I GOT HERE

09:48.055 --> 09:48.997
DOESN'T MAKE ME
WORRY ANY LESS.

09:49.097 --> 09:50.417
EVERYTHING IS FINE,
GLEN, JUST FINE.

09:50.517 --> 09:53.919
THINGS ARE JUST...

09:54.019 --> 09:55.841
DIFFERENT...NOW.

09:55.941 --> 09:57.426
YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE
SISTERS TO TALK TO,

09:57.526 --> 09:59.302
AND I THINK THAT'S
GREAT, I REALLY DO,

09:59.402 --> 10:01.929
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN

10:02.029 --> 10:03.516
THAT WE STILL
CAN'T BE THERE FOR
EACH OTHER, DOES IT?

10:03.617 --> 10:04.993
TALK TO ME, PAIGE.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.830
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

10:11.710 --> 10:14.906
PAIGE?

10:15.006 --> 10:17.284
UH...DARRYL
GOT US THAT THING

10:17.384 --> 10:20.873
WITH THE GUY THAT
PHOEBE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

10:20.973 --> 10:23.083
ARE YOU COMING?

10:23.183 --> 10:24.878
YEAH, I CAN'T.

10:24.978 --> 10:26.060
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

10:27.062 --> 10:28.964
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
KEEP YOUR CELL PHONE
AVAILABLE,

10:29.064 --> 10:32.094
JUST IN CASE
ANYTHING COMES UP.

10:32.194 --> 10:34.322
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

10:38.870 --> 10:42.081
EXCUSE ME.

10:43.459 --> 10:46.655
PAIGE!

10:46.755 --> 10:47.989
YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE
HIM HERE ALONE?

10:48.089 --> 10:49.991
WELL, HE CAN'T
FIT IN MY CUBICLE
WITH ME AT WORK.

10:50.091 --> 10:53.163
PAIGE, KEEPING
YOUR SECRET

10:53.263 --> 10:54.373
HAS TO BE THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING.

10:54.473 --> 10:56.042
I KNOW,

10:56.142 --> 10:57.336
WHICH IS WHY I JUST LIED
TO MY BEST FRIEND.

10:57.436 --> 10:59.254
IT DIDN'T FEEL GOOD,
LEO, BUT I DID IT.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.005
THAT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

11:01.105 --> 11:02.258
IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE
TO LEAVE HIM HERE.

11:02.358 --> 11:04.260
YOU TOLD ME
WHEN I BECAME A WITCH
I COULD STILL HAVE A LIFE.

11:04.361 --> 11:06.514
I CALL HAVING A FRIEND
HAVING A LIFE.

11:06.615 --> 11:08.014
YEAH, BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN--

11:08.114 --> 11:09.309
PAIGE?

11:09.409 --> 11:10.310
PAIGE? OH.

11:10.410 --> 11:11.687
I'M INTERRUPTING
AGAIN.

11:11.787 --> 11:13.564
YEAH.

11:13.665 --> 11:14.608
ALL RIGHT,

11:14.708 --> 11:15.901
WE GOTTA GO,

11:16.002 --> 11:17.026
SO BE SURE
TO LOCK UP
ALL THE DOORS

11:17.126 --> 11:20.130
BEFORE YOU GO.

11:23.134 --> 11:26.581
SHE ALWAYS
THAT FRIENDLY?

11:26.681 --> 11:28.543
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

11:28.643 --> 11:30.143
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

11:35.568 --> 11:39.640
I STILL DON'T
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY
WHO YOU PEOPLE ARE.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.228
DID INSPECTOR MORRIS
VOUCH FOR US?

11:43.328 --> 11:45.355
YES, BUT THAT
DOESN'T REALLY--

11:45.455 --> 11:46.649
THEN ALL
YOU NEED TO KNOW

11:46.749 --> 11:48.066
IS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO SAVE YOUR CLIENT.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.110
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

11:49.210 --> 11:51.030
LOOK, THE JURY'S
DELIBERATING.

11:51.130 --> 11:52.657
NOTHING SHORT
OF A MIRACLE
CAN HELP HIM NOW.

11:52.757 --> 11:55.094
PRECISELY.

11:56.176 --> 11:59.080
DON'T TELL ME THEY
ALREADY REACHED A VERDICT?

11:59.180 --> 12:00.333
NO, THEY HAVEN'T.

12:00.433 --> 12:01.668
UM...

12:01.768 --> 12:02.837
THESE PEOPLE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU.

12:02.937 --> 12:04.397
WHO ARE YOU?

12:05.481 --> 12:07.090
WE'RE PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE YOU'RE INNOCENT.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.092
SO, IF YOU DON'T MIND,

12:08.192 --> 12:09.469
WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

12:09.569 --> 12:11.095
WAS THERE ANYTHING
IN YOUR PREMONITION

12:11.196 --> 12:12.640
TO INDICATE
WHO THE KILLER MIGHT BE?

12:12.741 --> 12:14.643
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S IT!

12:14.743 --> 12:16.980
OUT!
WHAT? WHY?

12:17.080 --> 12:18.565
BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT HANGING ANY
MORE OF THIS CASE

12:18.665 --> 12:20.776
ON THAT SO-CALLED
VISION OF HIS

12:20.876 --> 12:22.278
UNLESS YOU WANT HIM
TO PLEAD INSANITY.

12:22.378 --> 12:23.487
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

12:23.587 --> 12:24.489
YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE ME

12:24.589 --> 12:28.117
ABOUT HAVING
HAD A PREMONITION.

12:28.217 --> 12:29.512
YES, WE DO.

12:30.723 --> 12:32.891
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW

12:34.686 --> 12:37.129
IF WE HAVE ANY CHANCE
OF SAVING YOU.

12:37.229 --> 12:39.131
OH, I DON'T NEED
A PREMONITION TO KNOW
WHO KILLED ANGIE.

12:39.232 --> 12:41.134
IT WAS WIKE,

12:41.234 --> 12:42.135
ANDREW WIKE.

12:42.235 --> 12:43.472
HE OWNS THE MAGIC CLUB
WHERE I PERFORMED.

12:43.572 --> 12:45.307
WHY DO YOU THINK
HE KILLED HER?

12:45.408 --> 12:47.142
ANGIE KEPT THE BOOKS
FOR THE CLUB

12:47.242 --> 12:49.063
EVEN AFTER WE GOT DIVORCED.

12:49.163 --> 12:50.314
SHE FOUND OUT THAT
WIKE WAS USING THE CLUB

12:50.414 --> 12:53.234
TO LAUNDER DIRTY MONEY.

12:53.334 --> 12:55.029
AND WHEN HE FOUND OUT
THAT SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT,

12:55.129 --> 12:58.156
WELL, HE KILLED HER
WITH ONE OF MY KNIVES

12:58.256 --> 13:00.927
TO FRAME ME.

13:01.763 --> 13:03.581
AND I GO AND HELP HIM
BY TELLING THE POLICE
WHERE ANGIE'S BODY WAS.

13:03.681 --> 13:06.960
DO YOU KNOW
IF WIKE HAS A TATTOO

13:07.060 --> 13:09.631
OF A MEDUSA HEAD
ON HIS ARM?

13:09.731 --> 13:11.316
I DON'T KNOW.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.944
WELL, LET'S HOPE
HE DOES.

13:15.071 --> 13:16.723
THANK YOU.

13:16.823 --> 13:18.282
LOOK OUT. NANCY DREW
COMIN' THROUGH.

13:31.299 --> 13:35.330
MAYBE WE SHOULD
COME BACK AT NIGHT
WHEN THEY'RE OPEN.

13:35.430 --> 13:38.207
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

13:38.308 --> 13:39.585
WOW, HOW DOES THIS PLACE
STAY IN BUSINESS?

13:39.685 --> 13:41.730
AAH!

13:43.732 --> 13:45.510
DEMONS YOU CAN HANDLE,
BUT NOT RATS?

13:45.610 --> 13:47.219
NYAH!

13:47.319 --> 13:48.321
HEY!

13:49.322 --> 13:50.349
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOIN'
IN HERE?

13:50.449 --> 13:51.685
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

13:51.785 --> 13:54.689
UM, WE'RE FRIENDS
OF STAN PROVAZOLLI'S.

13:54.789 --> 13:56.482
GOOD FOR YOU.
WE'RE CLOSED.

13:56.582 --> 13:58.401
YEAH, I SEE THAT.

13:58.501 --> 14:00.113
I WAS JUST HOPING--

14:00.213 --> 14:01.114
I SAID
WE'RE CLOSED,

14:01.214 --> 14:02.238
AND I DON'T
WANNA HAVE
TO SAY IT AGAIN.

14:02.338 --> 14:03.340
LEAVE.

14:11.936 --> 14:15.423
ALL I AM SAYING
IS TO REACH

14:15.523 --> 14:16.967
A FAIR AND JUST
VERDICT,

14:17.067 --> 14:18.552
WE HAVE TO ANALYZE
EVERY ASPECT OF THIS CASE.

14:18.652 --> 14:21.264
WE'VE DONE THAT.

14:21.364 --> 14:22.264
TWICE.

14:22.364 --> 14:23.976
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE WE
SHOULD DO IT A THIRD TIME.

14:24.076 --> 14:26.104
BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME

14:26.204 --> 14:27.701
THAT YOU PEOPLE CARE MORE
ABOUT GETTING HOME FOR DINNER

14:27.711 --> 14:30.026
THAN ABOUT THE FACT
THAT THE EVIDENCE

14:30.126 --> 14:31.539
AGAINST STAN PROVAZOLLI
IS ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

14:31.549 --> 14:34.490
HE LED THE POLICE
TO THE BODY!

14:34.590 --> 14:35.824
YOU HEARD
THE SHRINK SAY

14:35.925 --> 14:37.284
THAT'S AS GOOD
AS A CONFESSION.

14:37.384 --> 14:38.703
UNLESS IT WAS A PREMONITION.

14:38.803 --> 14:40.247
SHE'S BACK
TO THAT AGAIN.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.791
IS IT SO HARD FOR YOU
TO BELIEVE THAT
THAT'S POSSIBLE,

14:41.891 --> 14:44.711
THAT THERE ARE POWERS
BEYOND WHAT WE CAN SEE?

14:44.811 --> 14:47.296
OH, PBBT.

14:47.396 --> 14:49.092
OHH!

14:49.192 --> 14:51.136
OK.

14:51.236 --> 14:52.263
UM...

14:52.363 --> 14:54.224
HAVEN'T ANY OF YOU
EVER KNOWN

14:54.324 --> 14:56.308
WHO WAS CALLING BEFORE
YOU ANSWERED THE PHONE?

14:56.408 --> 14:58.687
THAT'S NOT MAGIC.

14:58.787 --> 15:00.023
OH, NO?

15:00.123 --> 15:01.374
THEN WHAT IS IT?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.819
LOOK, JUST BECAUSE YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND MAGIC

15:03.920 --> 15:06.823
DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU
HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF IT.

15:06.923 --> 15:08.300
IT'S AROUND US
ALL THE TIME

15:09.425 --> 15:11.327
LIKE A FRIEND,

15:11.427 --> 15:12.831
GUIDING US,
GIVING US INSPIRATION,

15:12.931 --> 15:15.332
HELPING US FALL IN LOVE.

15:15.432 --> 15:17.103
GIVING OUR LIVES MEANING,

15:18.772 --> 15:21.675
AND I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK
THAT WE ALL NEED TO BELIEVE

15:21.776 --> 15:25.345
THAT MAGIC EXISTS.

15:25.445 --> 15:26.949
TANYA.

15:28.409 --> 15:30.954
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
AN ANGEL PIN?

15:31.413 --> 15:32.331
I DON'T KNOW,

15:34.625 --> 15:36.111
JUST BECAUSE
MY MOTHER
GAVE IT TO ME.

15:36.211 --> 15:37.461
BUT WHY DID SHE
GIVE IT TO YOU?

15:38.339 --> 15:39.463
TO WATCH OVER ME.

15:41.634 --> 15:43.203
THAT'S MAGIC.

15:43.303 --> 15:45.206
SOMETHING
THAT YOU CAN'T SEE,

15:45.306 --> 15:47.000
YOU CAN'T QUITE
PUT YOUR FINGER ON IT,

15:47.100 --> 15:50.588
BUT YOU KNOW
THAT IT'S THERE.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.506
THE MAN KILLED
A WOMAN!

15:52.606 --> 15:54.009
PERIOD.
END OF STORY.

15:54.109 --> 15:55.860
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR
OF ANOTHER VOTE.

16:01.660 --> 16:04.939
OOPS.

16:05.039 --> 16:06.398
NATURE CALLS.

16:06.498 --> 16:08.110
OH, NO.
NO, YOU DON'T!

16:08.210 --> 16:09.402
NO, NO, NO!

16:09.502 --> 16:10.503
NOT AGAIN!
NO WAY!

16:12.383 --> 16:15.786
WE GOTTA
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

16:15.886 --> 16:17.412
HI.
HI.

16:17.512 --> 16:19.334
WE FOUND
THE REAL KILLER.

16:19.434 --> 16:20.416
THE OWNER
OF THE MAGIC CLUB,

16:20.516 --> 16:21.417
A GUY NAMED
ANDREW WIKE.

16:21.517 --> 16:22.418
CAN YOU PROVE IT?

16:22.519 --> 16:23.421
THAT'S
THE NEXT STEP.

16:23.521 --> 16:25.422
OK, WELL, YOU GOTTA HURRY,
BECAUSE I AM DYING IN THERE.

16:25.522 --> 16:27.843
IT WOULD BE
SO MUCH EASIER IF WE
COULD JUST VANQUISH HIM.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.220
YOU CAN'T DO THAT,

16:29.320 --> 16:30.429
BUT YOU MIGHT
BE ABLE TO USE
YOUR MAGIC.

16:30.529 --> 16:31.431
WELL, THERE IS ONE GUY

16:31.531 --> 16:32.515
I'D LOVE TO TURN
INTO A WARTHOG.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.269
NOT ON THE JURY.

16:34.369 --> 16:35.435
ON THE KILLER.

16:35.535 --> 16:36.772
YOU AND PAIGE COULD
USE YOUR POWERS

16:36.872 --> 16:38.399
TO SCARE HIM
INTO CONFESSING.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.442
AND SHOW OUR POWERS
TO WIKE? I DO
NOT THINK SO.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.738
WELL, DO YOU THINK
ANYBODY'S GONNA
BELIEVE HIM

16:42.838 --> 16:43.446
IF HE SAYS ANYTHING?

16:43.546 --> 16:44.447
NOT THIS JURY.

16:44.547 --> 16:46.201
[BANGING ON DOOR]

16:46.301 --> 16:47.869
UH...SORRY.

16:47.969 --> 16:49.537
UM...

16:49.637 --> 16:50.890
CAN SOMEBODY
FIND ME A PLUNGER?

16:52.100 --> 16:52.725
WHAT?

16:55.396 --> 16:56.297
I GOTTA BUY
SOME TIME SOMEHOW.

16:56.397 --> 16:58.465
AND YOU GOTTA CALL PAIGE.

16:58.565 --> 17:00.260
MAYBE THERE'S A SPELL
IN <i>THE BOOK OF SHADOWS
</i> WE CAN USE?

17:00.360 --> 17:02.322
OK, GO, GO, GO!

17:05.326 --> 17:08.578
OK.

17:14.337 --> 17:17.700
PIPER, ARE YOU
UP HERE?

17:17.800 --> 17:19.576
WHAT'S
THE EMERGENCY?

17:19.675 --> 17:20.845
OH, MY GOD, GLEN,

17:23.390 --> 17:24.498
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP HERE?

17:24.598 --> 17:25.917
IT'S FUNNY.
SEE, AFTER YOU LEFT,

17:26.018 --> 17:28.338
I WAS STILL HUNGRY,
SO I OPENED THE FRIDGE,

17:28.438 --> 17:30.216
AND I FOUND
SOME BAGS LABELED

17:30.316 --> 17:32.509
"PIGS' FEET,

17:32.609 --> 17:34.511
"RABBIT BLOOD,

17:34.611 --> 17:36.306
FROG TONGUE."

17:36.407 --> 17:39.144
SO I DECIDED TO TAKE
A LITTLE LOOK AROUND.

17:39.244 --> 17:41.521
FOUND MORE THAN
WHAT I BARGAINED FOR.

17:41.621 --> 17:43.858
LOOK, I CAN EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

17:43.958 --> 17:46.653
OK, I REALLY CAN.

17:46.753 --> 17:48.448
I'LL JUST HAVE
TO EXPLAIN IT LATER,

17:48.548 --> 17:49.949
'CAUSE IF PIPER
FINDS US UP HERE,
SHE'S GONNA FREAK.

17:50.049 --> 17:51.701
PIPER'S
GONNA FREAK?

17:51.801 --> 17:53.078
I JUST
FOUND OUT THAT
YOUR NEW SISTERS

17:53.178 --> 17:54.913
HAVE YOU MESSING
WITH THE OCCULT

17:55.014 --> 17:55.874
IN A PRETTY
SERIOUS WAY.

17:55.974 --> 17:57.501
AND YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT

17:57.601 --> 17:58.502
HOW THEY'RE
GONNA FREAK?

17:58.602 --> 18:00.171
LOOK...

18:00.271 --> 18:02.340
WE'RE NOT MESSING AROUND
WITH THE OCCULT.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.634
WE'RE...

18:04.734 --> 18:06.471
WITCHES.

18:06.571 --> 18:07.649
MY SISTERS AND I
ARE BORN, GOOD WITCHES.

18:07.659 --> 18:11.101
WE DO GOOD MAGIC.

18:11.201 --> 18:12.270
THIS BOOK IS
FULL OF PICTURES

18:12.370 --> 18:15.564
OF DEMONS
AND WARLOCKS.

18:15.664 --> 18:17.567
WELL, DEMONS AND WARLOCKS
THAT WE FIGHT AND DESTROY.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.737
OH, THESE GIRLS HAVE
YOU BRAINWASHED.

18:19.837 --> 18:22.115
I MEAN, HOW DO YOU
EVEN KNOW

18:22.216 --> 18:23.117
THAT THESE
ARE YOUR SISTERS?

18:23.217 --> 18:24.202
GLEN, YOU GOTTA
TRUST ME. PLEASE.

18:24.302 --> 18:26.662
I'M NOT BRAINWASHED,

18:26.762 --> 18:28.916
I AM STILL
THE SAME OLD PAIGE,

18:29.016 --> 18:30.583
ONLY NOW IF I...

18:30.683 --> 18:32.295
MAKE A RHYME,
MAGIC HAPPENS.

18:32.396 --> 18:34.423
PAIGE.

18:34.523 --> 18:35.674
LOOK, YOU'VE
BEEN TO AFRICA.

18:35.774 --> 18:37.676
YOU'VE MET
THOSE WITCH DOCTORS
ON YOUR TRAVELS, RIGHT?

18:37.777 --> 18:40.596
YEAH, BUT THESE
GUYS WERE, LIKE,
100 YEARS OLD,

18:40.696 --> 18:43.435
AND THEY SPEAK
IN TONGUES, AND...

18:43.535 --> 18:45.703
YOU'RE YOU.

18:48.707 --> 18:52.196
THERE IS A SPELL
IN HERE...

18:52.296 --> 18:53.739
WHAT?

18:53.839 --> 18:55.826
TO STRETCH
THE IMAGINATION.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.579
IT SHOULD
BE ABLE TO HELP YOU

18:58.679 --> 19:00.915
UNDERSTAND AND
ACCEPT THE TRUTH ABOUT ME.

19:01.015 --> 19:03.377
SO, YOU'RE GONNA
CAST A SPELL ON ME?

19:03.478 --> 19:06.422
WITH YOUR PERMISSION.

19:06.522 --> 19:07.631
AND WHEN
NOTHING HAPPENS--

19:07.731 --> 19:09.633
WHEN NOTHING HAPPENS,
YOU CAN DRAG ME OFF
TO THE FUNNY FARM,

19:09.734 --> 19:11.636
TELL THEM
I'VE BEEN BRAINWASHED.

19:11.736 --> 19:12.763
BELIEVE ME,
I COULD USE THE VACATION.

19:12.864 --> 19:14.659
OH, HERE IT IS.

19:16.743 --> 19:19.646
"LET MIND AND BODY SOAR

19:19.746 --> 19:21.150
TO HEIGHTS
NOT REACHED BEFORE.

19:21.250 --> 19:22.651
LET LIMITS STRETCH
THAT YOU MAY CATCH

19:22.751 --> 19:25.506
A NEW TRUTH TO EXPLORE."

19:26.423 --> 19:27.549
UHHH.

19:29.719 --> 19:31.746
I DON'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENT.

19:31.846 --> 19:33.416
IT'S WEIRD.
IT ALWAYS WORKS.

19:33.516 --> 19:36.170
Piper:
PAIGE? WHERE ARE YOU?

19:36.270 --> 19:37.670
GOD, WE GOTTA
HIDE YOU. COME ON.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.440
NO, WAIT.
WE CAN HIDE--

19:40.275 --> 19:41.176
AAH!

19:41.276 --> 19:42.177
UH...

19:42.277 --> 19:43.445
IT'S THE SPELL.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.283
JUST...PULL IT BACK.

19:48.577 --> 19:52.482
OH, I WAS,
UH, GIVING GLEN
A TOUR OF THE HOUSE.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.693
NEXT STOP,
THE BASEMENT.

19:55.793 --> 19:57.380
COME ON, GLEN,
WHY DON'T YOU
GET A HEAD START?

19:59.466 --> 20:02.928
A TOUR?
OF THE ATTIC?

20:06.099 --> 20:09.420
YOU SHOWED HIM
THE BOOK?

20:09.520 --> 20:10.712
WELL, HE WENT
INTO THE FRIDGE

20:10.812 --> 20:12.216
AND HE SAW
THE POTION
INGREDIENTS.

20:12.316 --> 20:13.509
SO
UNDERSTANDABLY,

20:13.609 --> 20:14.510
HE STARTED
LOOKING AROUND

20:14.610 --> 20:15.845
AND HE
FOUND THE BOOK.

20:15.945 --> 20:17.096
SO YOU DIDN'T
LOCK THE ATTIC?

20:17.196 --> 20:19.266
IT DIDN'T
OCCUR TO ME.

20:19.366 --> 20:21.478
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:21.578 --> 20:22.823
I TOLD YOU TO LOCK
ALL THE DOORS BEFORE YOU GO.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.730
WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU MEANT
THE FRONT DOOR.

20:24.830 --> 20:26.525
MAYBE YOU
SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE SPECIFIC.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.027
WELL,
I WAS SPEAKING IN CODE.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.529
LISTEN,
I TRUST GLEN.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.242
YEAH, BUT
YOU'RE TRUSTING HIM

20:32.342 --> 20:33.326
WITH A SECRET
THAT IS ALL OF OURS,

20:33.426 --> 20:34.869
NOT JUST YOURS.

20:34.969 --> 20:36.455
Leo: HONEY,
SHE DIDN'T TELL HIM
ABOUT IT.

20:36.555 --> 20:37.747
HE DISCOVERED IT.

20:37.847 --> 20:40.293
BECAUSE SHE LEFT HIM
IN THE HOUSE.

20:40.393 --> 20:41.878
BECAUSE SHE LET HIM
STAY IN THE HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:41.978 --> 20:44.048
OK.
SO YOU'RE SAYING
I HAVE TO CHOOSE

20:44.148 --> 20:45.509
BETWEEN HAVING
ANY FRIENDS AND
BEING A WITCH?

20:45.609 --> 20:47.469
YES! I HAVE.

20:47.569 --> 20:48.761
WELL, I WON'T.

20:48.861 --> 20:50.515
OK.

20:50.615 --> 20:52.685
WE ALL NEED TO
PUT THIS ON HOLD
FOR A SECOND, OK?

20:52.785 --> 20:54.186
LET'S TAKE
A DEEP BREATH.

20:54.286 --> 20:55.770
LET'S
CALM DOWN.

20:55.870 --> 20:56.771
WE HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO

20:56.871 --> 20:57.857
AND NOT
A LOT OF TIME
TO DO IT WITH.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.125
WHAT DO WE
HAVE TO DO?

21:01.504 --> 21:02.614
PIPER WILL
FILL YOU IN
ON THE WAY.

21:02.714 --> 21:05.050
I NEED TO GO
CHECK ON PHOEBE.

21:14.396 --> 21:18.134
Phoebe: SO ACTUALLY,
THE ORIGIN OF MAGIC

21:18.234 --> 21:20.345
DATES BACK
TO PREHISTORIC TIMES.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.431
PEOPLE FROM
ALL CULTURES
BELIEVED IN--

21:22.531 --> 21:25.184
LET'S VOTE.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.185
NOW.
Phoebe: WAIT.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.354
NO, NO, NO.
WE VOTE.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.148
OK, IF WE--
IF WE CAN'T AGREE,

21:29.248 --> 21:30.650
WE DECLARE
A HUNG JURY.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.235
ALL IN FAVOR
OF A GUILTY VERDICT?

21:32.335 --> 21:34.112
PEOPLE, PLEASE!

21:34.212 --> 21:35.821
THERE IS MAGIC
IN THE WORLD.

21:35.922 --> 21:37.408
THERE ARE ANGELS.

21:37.509 --> 21:39.161
TANYA, YOU CAN
TELL YOUR MOTHER
THAT SHE'S RIGHT.

21:39.261 --> 21:40.828
THEY'RE REAL.

21:40.928 --> 21:42.122
AND THERE ARE FAIRIES.

21:42.223 --> 21:43.207
THEY'RE REAL, TOO.

21:43.307 --> 21:44.833
I MEAN, JUST THINK BACK
TO YOUR CHILDHOOD

21:44.933 --> 21:46.587
BEFORE
YOU WERE TOO JADED
TO BELIEVE IN THEM.

21:46.687 --> 21:48.339
AND--AND--AND CUPID!

21:48.440 --> 21:50.841
NOT A MYTH!
I MEAN, HE DOESN'T
ACTUALLY USE ARROWS,

21:50.941 --> 21:52.943
BUT--BUT HE'S REAL, TOO.

21:54.946 --> 21:57.934
BAILIFF!

21:58.034 --> 21:59.202
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:00.538 --> 22:01.855
WE DON'T HAVE TO
DECLARE A HUNG JURY
AFTER ALL.

22:01.955 --> 22:04.360
WE DON'T?

22:04.460 --> 22:05.712
CALL ME?

22:07.338 --> 22:08.883
TELL THE JUDGE
THAT WE HAVE
A JUROR WHO'S, UM...

22:10.801 --> 22:11.720
NOT QUITE RIGHT.

22:14.055 --> 22:15.583
WE'RE ASKING
THAT SHE BE DISMISSED

22:15.683 --> 22:17.794
AND THAT YOU BRING IN
ONE OF THE ALTERNATES.

22:17.894 --> 22:19.253
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

22:19.353 --> 22:21.090
NO.

22:21.190 --> 22:22.982
AND YOU ALL AGREE?

22:24.527 --> 22:27.888
OK.
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

22:27.988 --> 22:30.519
I HAVE AN IDEA.

22:30.619 --> 22:31.703
IF I CAN CONVINCE YOU,

22:32.830 --> 22:34.897
ALL OF YOU...

22:34.997 --> 22:37.653
THAT MAGIC
REALLY DOES EXIST,

22:37.753 --> 22:39.905
WILL THAT BE ENOUGH
REASONABLE DOUBT
FOR AN ACQUITTAL?

22:40.005 --> 22:42.409
LADY,

22:42.509 --> 22:44.077
YOU'RE LATE
FOR YOUR SHRINK,

22:44.177 --> 22:45.287
LIKE 2 YEARS LATE.

22:45.387 --> 22:47.289
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MAGIC?

22:47.389 --> 22:49.084
LIKE
SIEGFRIED AND ROY STUFF?

22:49.184 --> 22:51.044
NO. I MEAN REAL MAGIC.

22:51.144 --> 22:53.673
NO TRAPDOORS,

22:53.774 --> 22:54.924
NO SMOKE, NO MIRRORS.

22:55.024 --> 22:57.302
JUST REAL
SUPERNATURAL MAGIC.

22:57.402 --> 23:00.891
COME ON,
SHE'S STALLING.

23:00.991 --> 23:02.351
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

23:02.451 --> 23:04.855
ARE YOU AFRAID
I MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE ABLE TO PULL IT OFF?

23:04.955 --> 23:06.939
WELL, WE'VE BEEN HERE
THIS LONG.

23:07.039 --> 23:09.234
I SAY WE LET HER
TAKE IT ON HOME.

23:09.335 --> 23:11.044
ALL RIGHT...

23:12.045 --> 23:12.947
BUT IF YOU FAIL,

23:13.047 --> 23:17.053
YOU VOTE GUILTY
WITH THE REST OF US.

23:20.558 --> 23:23.753
FINE.

23:23.853 --> 23:25.046
CALL THE JUDGE.
OK, OK, OK, OK.

23:25.146 --> 23:27.967
IT'S A DEAL.

23:28.067 --> 23:29.470
Tanya: ALL RIGHT.

23:29.570 --> 23:31.446
SHOW US SOME MAGIC.

23:33.072 --> 23:35.953
I'M GONNA NEED
A FEW THINGS.

23:36.829 --> 23:37.997
A SAGE STICK,

23:39.080 --> 23:39.981
5 WHITE CANDLES, AND--

23:40.081 --> 23:40.983
A MAGIC WAND.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.985
NO. INCENSE.

23:43.085 --> 23:45.256
I'M GONNA
SUMMON THE DEAD.

23:56.186 --> 24:00.007
OK, JUST REMEMBER,
YOU PLAY GOOD WITCH,

24:00.107 --> 24:02.135
I PLAY BAD WITCH.

24:02.236 --> 24:03.972
OK, BUT WON'T THAT
RISK EXPOSING
OUR POWERS?

24:04.072 --> 24:08.017
NO, I'M ONLY GOING
TO SHOW MY POWERS
TO WIKE,

24:08.117 --> 24:10.230
AND ONCE
WE GET HIM TO TALK,

24:10.330 --> 24:11.397
WE'RE GOING
TO USE THE TAPE

24:11.498 --> 24:12.816
TO FORCE HIM
TO CONFESS TO THE POLICE.

24:12.916 --> 24:15.779
SO IT'S OK
TO SHOW OUR POWERS
TO A MURDERER,

24:15.879 --> 24:18.741
BUT NOT TO GLEN?

24:18.841 --> 24:20.953
SAVING AN INNOCENT'S LIFE
IS WORTH THE RISK.

24:21.053 --> 24:23.680
ENTERTAINING FRIENDS
IS NOT.

24:31.066 --> 24:34.051
BOO!

24:34.151 --> 24:35.345
AAH!

24:35.445 --> 24:36.472
WHAT THE HELL?

24:36.572 --> 24:38.056
WHAT ARE YOU?

24:38.156 --> 24:39.910
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

24:41.079 --> 24:41.980
WE WANT A CONFESSION.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.162
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.

24:46.043 --> 24:49.698
CAREFUL, PIPER.
YOU MIGHT KILL HIM.

24:49.798 --> 24:50.865
SO?

24:50.965 --> 24:52.576
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:52.676 --> 24:53.410
SURE YOU DO.

24:53.511 --> 24:55.496
ANGELA PROVAZOLLI
FOUND OUT ABOUT

24:55.596 --> 24:57.416
YOUR LITTLE
MONEY LAUNDERING
OPERATION,

24:57.516 --> 24:59.084
SO YOU KILLED HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

24:59.184 --> 25:01.145
Paige:
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER
LIKE THIS, PAL.

25:02.898 --> 25:04.008
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TALK.

25:04.108 --> 25:05.191
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS GETTING BORING.

25:06.610 --> 25:09.096
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE MOVE ON
TO SOME BODY PARTS?

25:09.196 --> 25:11.266
OK, OK, OK!

25:11.366 --> 25:12.310
ALL RIGHT!

25:12.410 --> 25:14.395
ALL RIGHT,
I ADMIT IT.

25:14.496 --> 25:16.858
I KILLED HER.

25:16.958 --> 25:18.191
SHE WAS READY
TO MARCH THE COPS
DOWN TO PIER 86.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.653
IF I HADN'T
HAVE KILLED HER,

25:20.754 --> 25:22.112
THEY WOULD'VE.

25:22.212 --> 25:23.449
AND THEN THEY WOULD
HAVE KILLED ME.

25:23.549 --> 25:24.968
WHO? THE COPS?

25:26.052 --> 25:27.454
NO. NO,
NOT THE COPS.

25:27.554 --> 25:30.042
THEY...

25:30.142 --> 25:31.350
LOOK. BELIEVE ME.

25:32.936 --> 25:36.256
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

25:36.357 --> 25:37.442
TRY ME.

25:38.193 --> 25:38.610
WHAT THE--

25:41.655 --> 25:42.490
PRETTY GOOD.

25:45.368 --> 25:46.036
WHERE'D HE GO?

25:48.832 --> 25:50.692
THERE'S GOTTA
BE A TRAPDOOR.

25:50.792 --> 25:52.251

25:53.588 --> 25:54.756
DOES THIS THING WORK?

25:56.800 --> 25:57.885
THERE'S GOTTA
BE STAIRS HERE.

26:03.391 --> 26:06.672
WAIT.

26:06.772 --> 26:07.964
ALL RIGHT,
DON'T.

26:08.064 --> 26:09.273
I CAN EXPLAIN.

26:11.235 --> 26:14.263
YOU STUPID HUMAN.

26:14.363 --> 26:17.476
YOU TOLD THE WITCHES
EVERYTHING.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.771
AND THEY'VE
GOT IT ON TAPE!

26:19.872 --> 26:22.108
SO WHAT?

26:22.209 --> 26:23.526
THEY'LL
NEVER FIND OUT
ABOUT YOU GUYS.

BUT NOT RATS?

27:08.767 --> 27:10.937

WHERE DID HE GO?

27:23.536 --> 27:25.271
IS HELL TOO MUCH
TO HOPE FOR?

27:25.371 --> 27:27.876
YEAH, WELL,
AT LEAST WE GOT
HIS TAPED CONFESSION.

27:28.251 --> 27:30.296
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
NOT GONNA SAVE STAN

FOR THAT MATTER.

27:33.884 --> 27:36.078
WHY DON'T
WE JUST GIVE IT
TO THE POLICE?

27:36.178 --> 27:37.287
WELL, WITHOUT WIKE,

27:37.387 --> 27:38.623
THE CONFESSION
IS NO GOOD.

27:38.723 --> 27:40.042
I MEAN, DARRYL COULD
OPEN AN INVESTIGATION,

27:40.142 --> 27:42.461
BUT NOT IN TIME
TO EXONERATE--

27:42.561 --> 27:44.881
EW, NOW I ACTUALLY
SOUND LIKE NANCY DREW.

27:44.981 --> 27:47.509

WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO FIND WIKE?

27:47.609 --> 27:49.637

WE GONNA DO THAT?

THAT NOISE.

I'M IN SWITZERLAND.

ARE YOU CRAZY?

28:25.448 --> 28:27.477
NO,
BUT SOMEBODY IS.

28:27.577 --> 28:29.646
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

28:29.747 --> 28:31.899

SUPPOSED TO BE FUN FOR YOU.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.361
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE FOR YOU AT ALL.

28:35.461 --> 28:37.463
THEN I GUESS
I BETTER CALL OFF
THE TABLOIDS.

28:40.467 --> 28:44.165
HE WAS
JUST MAKING
A BAD JOKE.

28:44.265 --> 28:46.375
YEAH, FUNNY HOW
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT CAME TO HIS MIND.

28:46.475 --> 28:49.172
HE JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS BEING FUNNY.

28:49.272 --> 28:50.924
NOBODY GOT HURT.

28:51.024 --> 28:52.383
YEAH, MAYBE YOU'D
FEEL A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENTLY

28:52.483 --> 28:53.652
IF YOU HAD LOST A SISTER.

28:57.032 --> 29:00.312
DON'T ASK.

29:00.412 --> 29:03.190
DID YOU GET
WIKE TO CONFESS?

29:03.290 --> 29:05.151
YEAH,
AND THEN HE GOT AWAY.

29:05.251 --> 29:06.903
HOW'S PHOEBE DOING?

29:07.003 --> 29:07.905
NOT SO GOOD.

29:08.005 --> 29:09.323
SHE'S
TRYING TO SUMMON
THE VICTIM, ANGELA.

29:09.424 --> 29:10.406
WAIT A SECOND.

29:10.506 --> 29:11.700
SO IT'S NOT OK FOR ME

29:11.801 --> 29:13.202
TO TELL MY BEST FRIEND GLEN
THAT I'M A WITCH,

29:13.303 --> 29:14.955
BUT IT'S OK FOR PHOEBE
TO TELL AN ENTIRE ROOM
OF STRANGERS?

29:15.055 --> 29:17.708
THEY WERE GONNA
KICK HER OFF THE JURY.

29:17.808 --> 29:19.417
I THINK
IT WAS WORTH A TRY.

29:19.518 --> 29:20.420
ONLY
IT'S NOT GOING SO GOOD.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.422
I BELIEVE SHE NEEDS
THE POWER OF THREE.

29:22.522 --> 29:24.424
YEAH, WELL,
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET IT.

29:24.524 --> 29:26.261
IT'S BETTER FOR THEM
TO THINK SHE'S A NUT JOB

29:26.361 --> 29:27.721
THEN THINK SHE'S A WITCH.

29:27.821 --> 29:29.057
THERE'S AN INNOCENT MAN
AT STAKE, PIPER.

29:29.157 --> 29:31.433
THEY'LL CONVICT HIM,
AND THEN WE'LL
GO TO THE POLICE.

29:31.533 --> 29:33.435
THERE'LL BE A NEW TRIAL,
AND THEY'LL RELEASE HIM.

29:33.536 --> 29:35.438
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

29:35.538 --> 29:36.708
ALL RIGHT,
I HAVE AN IDEA.

29:38.918 --> 29:40.237
WHAT?
I'LL EXPLAIN
ON THE WAY.
LET'S GO.

29:40.337 --> 29:41.948
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

29:42.048 --> 29:44.450
YEAH, JUST
UNFREEZE HIM.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.552
HE WON'T
TELL ANYONE.

29:47.305 --> 29:50.376
WHAT?

29:50.476 --> 29:51.543
WHERE'D YOU
COME FROM?

29:51.643 --> 29:52.878
JUST STAY HERE,
ORDER A PIZZA.

29:52.979 --> 29:55.857
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

30:06.578 --> 30:10.193
Phoebe: BELOVED
SPIRIT ANGELA,

30:10.293 --> 30:11.861
I SEEK
YOUR GUIDANCE.

30:11.961 --> 30:13.587
I ASK THAT
YOU COMMUNE WITH ME
AND MOVE AMONG US.

30:17.592 --> 30:21.207
BELOVED SPIRIT
ANGELA--

30:21.307 --> 30:22.498
THAT'S ENOUGH.

30:22.599 --> 30:23.600
BAILIFF!

30:24.601 --> 30:28.216
TELL THE JUDGE
THAT WE'VE
REACHED A VERDICT.

30:28.316 --> 30:30.093
YEP. A DEAL'S A DEAL.

30:30.193 --> 30:32.805
ALL THOSE
IN FAVOR OF GUILTY?

30:32.905 --> 30:34.682
I'LL GET THE LIGHTS.

30:34.782 --> 30:36.643
BELOVED SPIRIT
ANGELA,

30:36.743 --> 30:38.312
I SEEK
YOUR GUIDANCE.

30:38.412 --> 30:39.747
I ASK THAT
YOU COMMUNE WITH ME
AND MOVE AMONG US.

30:42.292 --> 30:45.488
PHOEBE, 11 JURORS?

30:45.588 --> 30:47.699
I KNOW. I KNOW,
BUT THIS GUY
IS INNOCENT,

30:47.799 --> 30:50.494
AND HE'S BEING
PERSECUTED FOR HAVING
THE SAME GIFT THAT I DO.

30:50.595 --> 30:52.621
SO IF YOU GUYS
AREN'T HERE

30:52.721 --> 30:53.832
TO HELP ME
SUMMON ANGELA--

30:53.932 --> 30:55.293
WE ARE.

30:55.393 --> 30:56.542
WE ARE?
YES.

30:56.642 --> 30:58.464
IF LEO
WILL HELP US
CLEAN IT UP

30:58.564 --> 30:59.714
AFTER
WE'RE DONE.

30:59.814 --> 31:00.716
NO.

31:00.816 --> 31:02.550
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
NO?

31:02.650 --> 31:03.551
YOU'VE DONE IT
BEFORE.

31:03.651 --> 31:04.846
NO. IT IS
COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN

31:04.946 --> 31:06.723
EXCEPT IN CASES
OF DIRE EMERGENCY.

31:06.823 --> 31:08.559
WHAT'S FORBIDDEN?

31:08.659 --> 31:09.935
USING
MEMORY DUST
ON PEOPLE.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.563
OH, MY GOD.

31:11.663 --> 31:13.564
THIS IS BRILLIANT.

31:13.664 --> 31:15.735
WE'LL ERASE THEIR
SHORT-TERM MEMORIES

31:15.835 --> 31:17.362
AFTER THEY VOTE
NOT GUILTY.

31:17.462 --> 31:18.739
WAIT A SECOND.

31:18.839 --> 31:20.408
WHITELIGHTERS CAN
ERASE PEOPLE'S MEMORIES

31:20.508 --> 31:22.077
WITH SOME SORT
OF SPECIAL DUST?

31:22.177 --> 31:23.204
WHY DON'T YOU USE IT
ALL THE TIME?

31:23.304 --> 31:25.372
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ERASING.

31:25.472 --> 31:27.582
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT,

31:27.682 --> 31:28.583
CHILDRENS' BIRTHDAYS.

31:28.684 --> 31:30.003
LEO, THIS IS
AN EMERGENCY.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.715
I CANNOT LIVE
WITH THESE PEOPLE
KNOWING OUR SECRET,

31:32.815 --> 31:34.927
KNOWING THAT
AT ANY MINUTE

31:35.027 --> 31:36.594
WE COULD
HAVE TO RELIVE

31:36.694 --> 31:37.863
THE HELL
WE WENT THROUGH
WITH PRUE.

31:39.157 --> 31:39.449
OK.

31:44.955 --> 31:48.609
All: HEAR THESE WORDS,
HEAR OUR CRY

31:48.709 --> 31:50.780
SPIRIT FROM THE OTHER SIDE.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.825
COME TO US, WE SUMMON THEE.

31:52.925 --> 31:55.370
CROSS NOW THE GREAT DIVIDE.

31:55.470 --> 31:57.789
BELOVED SPIRIT
ANGELA.

31:57.889 --> 31:59.458
WE SEEK
YOUR GUIDANCE.

31:59.558 --> 32:00.851
WE ASK
YOU COMMUNE WITH US
AND MOVE AMONGST US.

32:02.811 --> 32:04.814
COLD WIND.
THAT'S OUR CUE.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.635
SEE YOU LATER.

32:08.735 --> 32:09.863
OK, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

32:19.459 --> 32:22.879
ARE YOU ALL SEEING THAT?

32:23.214 --> 32:24.340
DEAR GOD.

32:32.100 --> 32:35.462
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:35.563 --> 32:36.671
WHERE AM I?

32:36.771 --> 32:37.883
WE SUMMONED YOU,
ANGELA.

32:37.983 --> 32:40.428
WE NEED
YOUR HELP.

32:40.528 --> 32:42.471
ACTUALLY,
YOUR EX-HUSBAND
NEEDS YOUR HELP.

32:42.572 --> 32:44.433
Angela: STAN? WHY?

32:44.533 --> 32:46.684
HE'S ON TRIAL
FOR YOUR MURDER.

32:46.784 --> 32:48.438
STAN?

32:48.538 --> 32:49.772
ARE YOU KIDDING?
HE COULDN'T
HURT A FLY.

32:49.872 --> 32:53.068
EVEN HIS GIFT
TERRIFIED HIM.

32:53.168 --> 32:55.796
HIS GIFT?

32:57.882 --> 33:01.413
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.415
I'M LOOKING
FOR WIRES.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.460
THIS IS
SOME KIND OF TRICK.

33:05.560 --> 33:07.186
DID YOU
FIND ANY?

33:10.274 --> 33:13.719
WHAT ABOUT HIS GIFT?

33:13.819 --> 33:14.930
STAN COULD SEE THINGS,

33:15.030 --> 33:17.016
THE PAST
AND THE FUTURE.

33:17.116 --> 33:18.809
IT SCARED HIM.

33:18.909 --> 33:20.520
HE HATED IT.

33:20.620 --> 33:21.729
THAT'S WHY
HE NEVER NURTURED IT.

33:21.829 --> 33:23.650
ALL THE GOOD
HE COULD HAVE DONE...

33:23.750 --> 33:25.944
WASTED.

33:26.044 --> 33:27.112
SO HE
DIDN'T KILL YOU?

33:27.212 --> 33:29.031
NO. THE CLUB OWNER DID.

33:29.131 --> 33:32.370
ANDREW WIKE.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.163
I FOUND OUT HE WAS
LAUNDERING MONEY

33:34.263 --> 33:36.708
FROM SOME COMPANY
AT PIER 86.

33:36.808 --> 33:38.811
STAN WARNED ME
TO KEEP IT TO MYSELF.

33:39.853 --> 33:42.716
BUT I DIDN'T.

33:42.816 --> 33:45.444
HE IS A GOOD MAN.

33:48.198 --> 33:50.116
HE'S AN INNOCENT MAN.

33:54.872 --> 33:58.086
BLESSED BE.

34:08.889 --> 34:12.212
SHALL WE VOTE?

34:12.312 --> 34:13.815
NOT GUILTY.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.193
UNBELIEVABLE.

34:18.027 --> 34:20.447
SO SAY YOU ONE?

34:21.408 --> 34:24.244
SO SAY YOU ALL?

34:24.909 --> 34:26.163
THIS CASE IS DISMISSED.

34:28.458 --> 34:30.985
THE DEFENDANT
IS HEREBY RELEASED.

34:31.085 --> 34:33.214
THIS COURT IS ADJOURNED.

34:34.716 --> 34:35.676
DUST 'EM, LEO.

34:38.638 --> 34:39.848
DON'T FORGET
THE BAILIFF.

34:42.976 --> 34:43.935
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

34:46.565 --> 34:47.924
HOW'D YOU DO IT?

34:48.024 --> 34:48.841
WE DIDN'T.

34:48.940 --> 34:49.842
ANGELA DID.

34:49.942 --> 34:51.945
HI.

34:52.906 --> 34:53.806
HI.

34:53.907 --> 34:55.266
YOU HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL GIFT.

34:55.367 --> 34:58.396
AND YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING

34:58.496 --> 34:59.498
BY GOING
TO THE POLICE.

35:00.708 --> 35:02.569
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT ANYBODY ELSE
THINKS.

35:02.669 --> 35:04.629
ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT YOU USED
YOUR GIFT

35:06.256 --> 35:08.034
TO HELP PEOPLE.

35:08.134 --> 35:09.968
AND THAT'S
A BEAUTIFUL THING.

35:12.306 --> 35:16.587
SO YOU GUYS HAVE
TOLD PEOPLE ABOUT BEING
WITCHES LOTS OF TIMES.

35:16.687 --> 35:19.256
YES, INNOCENTS,

35:19.356 --> 35:20.882
BUT ONLY WHEN
WE DIDN'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE.

35:20.982 --> 35:23.470
OUR SECRET IS NEVER
MORE IMPORTANT THAN
SAVING SOMEBODY'S LIFE.

35:23.571 --> 35:26.599
CAN'T YOU GUYS
JUST ENJOY SAVING
THIS INNOCENT

35:26.700 --> 35:28.892
FOR A MINUTE
AND A HALF

35:28.993 --> 35:30.115
BEFORE GETTING BACK
TO THE GREAT DEBATE?

35:30.125 --> 35:31.815
WELL, IT'S NOT OVER YET.

35:31.915 --> 35:33.333
THE KILLER IS STILL
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

35:33.625 --> 35:35.126
[GASPS]

35:36.963 --> 35:38.840
GLEN!

35:46.225 --> 35:49.920
YOU HAVE ONE HOUR
TO DELIVER THE TAPE

35:50.021 --> 35:53.776
OR STRETCH HERE IS DEAD.

36:04.038 --> 36:07.694
PAIGE,
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

36:07.794 --> 36:09.279
JUST TRY TO BREATHE.

36:09.379 --> 36:10.656
OH, MY GOD.
IF ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO HIM--

36:10.756 --> 36:12.366
WE WON'T LET IT.

36:12.466 --> 36:13.950
WHEN DID THIS DEMON
BECOME INVOLVED?

36:14.050 --> 36:15.953
I THOUGHT THIS
KILLER WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE HUMAN.

36:16.053 --> 36:17.164
HE WAS,
BUT APPARENTLY

36:17.265 --> 36:19.292
HE WAS FRONTING
FOR DEMONS.

36:19.392 --> 36:20.959
SINCE WHEN DO DEMONS
GIVE A RAT'S ASS,
NO PUN INTENDED,

36:21.059 --> 36:24.131
ABOUT LAUNDERING MONEY?

36:24.232 --> 36:25.966
BECAUSE THEY NEED MONEY
TO INSINUATE THEMSELVES
INTO OUR WORLD.

36:26.066 --> 36:28.596
TO BUY CLOTHES,
RENT APARTMENTS,

36:28.696 --> 36:30.181
TO FIT IN WITH US.

36:30.281 --> 36:31.475
IT'S PROBABLY
THE SAME WAY

36:31.575 --> 36:32.975
THEY MADE COLE
LEGITIMATE WHEN
HE WAS A DEMON.

36:33.075 --> 36:35.771
I MEAN, THEY PUT HIM
THROUGH LAW SCHOOL.

36:35.871 --> 36:39.376
WHICH PUT HIM IN A POSITION
TO HURT US.WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE.

36:40.628 --> 36:42.197
HOW IS ANY OF THIS
GOING TO HELP US
GET GLEN BACK?

36:42.297 --> 36:44.407
EVEN IF WE GIVE
THAT RAT-DEMON THING
THE TAPE,

36:44.508 --> 36:47.621
WHAT'S TO STOP HIM
FROM KILLING GLEN?

36:47.721 --> 36:49.414
WE HAVE NO LEVERAGE.

36:49.514 --> 36:51.291
OK, UM, DO WE
HAVE TO CALL HIM
THE RAT-DEMON?

36:51.391 --> 36:54.002
BECAUSE
IT'S VERY HARD

36:54.102 --> 36:55.087
TO BE
APPROPRIATELY
FRIGHTENED.

36:55.187 --> 36:56.899
WE COULD
GO OVER HIS HEAD.

36:59.986 --> 37:01.822
LOOK, I GUARANTEE YOU
THAT THIS CLUB IS JUST
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

37:02.112 --> 37:05.727
I MEAN, IF WE WENT
TO RAT-DEMON'S--

37:05.827 --> 37:07.604
BUT WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO CALL HIM?

37:07.704 --> 37:08.814
ONE HOUR, LEO.
WE HAVE ONE HOUR.

37:08.914 --> 37:11.150
RIGHT, SO IF WE
GO TO THEIR BOSSES

37:11.250 --> 37:12.653
AND WE THREATEN TO EXPOSE
THEIR ENTIRE OPERATION,

37:12.753 --> 37:15.029
THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE
VERY PLEASED WITH HIM.

37:15.129 --> 37:17.031
SO WE OFFER HIM UP
IN EXCHANGE FOR GLEN?

37:17.132 --> 37:19.160
MIGHT WORK.

37:19.260 --> 37:20.454
MIGHT WORK?
IT HAS TO WORK.

37:20.554 --> 37:22.038
OK. SO THE ONLY QUESTION IS
WHERE IS DEMON CENTRAL?

37:22.138 --> 37:25.627
ANGELA SAID
SOMETHING
ABOUT PIER 86.

37:25.728 --> 37:28.422
SO DID WIKE.
SO WE SPLIT UP.

37:28.522 --> 37:31.343
PHOEBE, SINCE YOU HAVE
STALLING DOWN TO A SCIENCE,

37:31.443 --> 37:33.846
YOU AND PAIGE
GO TO THE CLUB
AND BUY SOME TIME.

37:33.946 --> 37:36.056
LEO AND I WILL GO TO--

37:36.156 --> 37:36.850
NO.

37:36.950 --> 37:38.058
NO. I'M GONNA GO.

37:38.159 --> 37:39.060
WELL, PIPER HAS
MORE FIREPOWER.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.398
AND IF THEY
GET HOSTILE--

37:41.498 --> 37:42.774
I'LL JUST HAVE LEO
ORB ME OUT OF THERE

37:42.875 --> 37:44.276
IF IT
GETS TOO HAIRY.

37:44.377 --> 37:45.820
I'M THE ONE
WHO PUT GLEN,
MY BEST FRIEND,

37:45.921 --> 37:48.197
IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS
OF DANGER.

37:48.298 --> 37:49.993
SO I'M GONNA
GET HIM OUT.

37:50.093 --> 37:51.344
JUST DO ME A FAVOR
AND KEEP HIM ALIVE
AT THE CLUB

37:54.014 --> 37:55.891
UNTIL I GET BACK.

38:08.574 --> 38:12.413
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS
IS THE RIGHT PLACE.

38:14.916 --> 38:15.667
SHH. LISTEN.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.916
RATS.

38:28.016 --> 38:28.876
LOTS OF THEM.

38:28.976 --> 38:30.628
TIME TO GO.

38:30.728 --> 38:31.754
NO.

38:31.855 --> 38:32.839
PAIGE,
I REALLY THINK--

38:32.939 --> 38:34.649
NO, LEO. THEY'VE
GOT GLEN.

38:38.989 --> 38:42.141
LISTEN UP.

38:42.241 --> 38:43.202
WE KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

38:44.244 --> 38:46.146
WE'RE PREPARED
TO TELL EVERYONE.

38:46.246 --> 38:48.149
JUST SO YOU KNOW,
KILLING ME
WON'T HELP

38:48.249 --> 38:50.361
BECAUSE MY SISTERS
WILL TAKE YOU DOWN.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.781
MAYBE YOU'VE
HEARD OF US.

38:52.882 --> 38:54.367
THE CHARMED ONES?

38:54.467 --> 38:56.011
NOW WHO AM
I TALKING TO?

39:20.333 --> 39:23.837
WE'RE LISTENING.

39:39.691 --> 39:42.971
THE TAPE.

39:43.071 --> 39:44.221
WHERE'S OUR FRIEND,
MOUSE-MAN?

39:44.321 --> 39:45.432
AFTER I GET THE TAPE.

39:45.532 --> 39:47.325
NO. BEFORE.

39:49.411 --> 39:52.859
I COULD TAKE IT FROM YOU.

39:52.959 --> 39:54.544
YOU COULD TRY.

39:59.340 --> 40:02.537
JUST SO YOU KNOW,

40:02.637 --> 40:03.873
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME,
ANYTHING AT ALL,

40:03.973 --> 40:06.667
THE RING WILL
DECAPITATE HIM.

40:06.768 --> 40:10.254
THAT'S NEW.

40:10.354 --> 40:11.482
SO MUCH FOR
A QUICK GETAWAY.

40:20.577 --> 40:24.107
ARE THERE ANY COPIES?

40:24.207 --> 40:25.273
NO.

40:25.374 --> 40:27.086
NOW LET HIM GO.

40:28.045 --> 40:28.963
HEY!
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

40:31.592 --> 40:32.993
I'M A RAT.

40:33.093 --> 40:34.762
WHAT'D YOU EXPECT?

40:35.179 --> 40:36.388
DON'T. DON'T. IT MIGHT
CHOP OFF GLEN'S HEAD.

40:39.101 --> 40:41.797
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

40:41.897 --> 40:42.798
ENJOY THE SHOW!

40:42.898 --> 40:44.733
[GASPS]
AAH! AAH! AAH!

40:50.657 --> 40:51.910
DID WE JUST DO THAT?

40:57.917 --> 41:01.213
GLEN!

41:03.215 --> 41:06.326
ONLY COPY?

41:06.426 --> 41:07.412
YES.

41:07.512 --> 41:08.413
Demon:
HOW DO WE KNOW?

41:08.513 --> 41:10.083
W-W-WHAT
DO YOU MEAN
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

41:10.183 --> 41:11.084
YOU JUST
GOTTA TRUST US.

41:11.184 --> 41:12.434
WE'RE THE GOOD
GUYS, FOR CRYING
OUT LOUD.

41:18.652 --> 41:22.447
GUESS WE'LL
CALL THIS ONE A DRAW.

41:30.876 --> 41:34.197
ALMOST DONE.

41:34.297 --> 41:36.284
THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG.

41:36.384 --> 41:37.534
CAN'T YOU JUST
USE A LITTLE MAGIC?

41:37.634 --> 41:39.120
DON'T YOU THINK
WE'VE USED
ENOUGH MAGIC LATELY?

41:39.220 --> 41:41.372
BESIDES, I LIKE
WORKING WITH MY HANDS.

41:41.472 --> 41:43.960
MM-HMM.

41:44.060 --> 41:45.376
YEAH, I KIND
OF LIKE A GUY
IN A TOOL BELT.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.605
REALLY?
MM-HMM.

41:48.023 --> 41:50.151
AHEM.

41:52.237 --> 41:55.224
OH, LEAVING SO SOON?

41:55.324 --> 41:56.391
YEAH, GLEN'S
GONNA GO STAY

41:56.491 --> 41:58.393
WITH
A FRIEND OF HIS
ACROSS THE BAY.

41:58.493 --> 42:00.814
HMM. I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHY YOU WOULDN'T

42:00.914 --> 42:01.983
WANT TO
HANG AROUND HERE.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.902
HA HA. YEAH, WELL,
I LIKE ADVENTURE,

42:04.002 --> 42:06.403
JUST NOT
<i>THAT</i> MUCH ADVENTURE.

42:06.504 --> 42:09.407
SO YOU'RE GONNA
STICK AROUND A WHILE?

42:09.507 --> 42:11.410
YEAH. KEEP AN EYE
ON NOOGIE HERE.

42:11.510 --> 42:13.331
NOOGIE?

42:13.431 --> 42:15.516
GLEN, I THINK IT'S
TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.927
THANKS FOR
SAVING MY LIFE.

42:23.027 --> 42:24.053
UH-HUH.

42:24.153 --> 42:25.428
I REVERSED
THE SPELL.

42:25.528 --> 42:26.973
JUST
CHECKING.

42:27.073 --> 42:28.532
BYE.
BYE.

42:29.576 --> 42:32.956
BYE, YOU.

42:34.624 --> 42:38.713
OK, DO YOU WANT IT NOW OR
SHOULD I E-MAIL IT TO YOU?

42:39.130 --> 42:42.450
WHAT?
MY APOLOGY.

42:42.550 --> 42:44.996
YOU'RE RIGHT.

42:45.096 --> 42:46.456
KEEPING OUR SECRET
IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

42:46.556 --> 42:48.876
I SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO YOU.

42:48.976 --> 42:50.353
DO YOU WANT MORE?
SHOULD I KEEP GROVELING?

42:51.561 --> 42:53.464
FUN AS
THAT WOULD BE...

42:53.564 --> 42:55.466
I'M SORRY, TOO.

42:55.567 --> 42:57.804
I CAN BE
A LITTLE HARSH,

42:57.905 --> 42:59.598
BUT IT'S PART
OF MY CHARM,

42:59.698 --> 43:00.683
YOU'LL LEARN
TO LOVE ME
FOR IT.

43:00.783 --> 43:02.686
WOW.

43:02.786 --> 43:04.688
WE ACTUALLY
HAVE A DOOR.

43:04.788 --> 43:06.816
IMAGINE THAT.

43:06.916 --> 43:08.026
SO, HOW'S THE JURY?

43:08.126 --> 43:09.653
FINE. I KNOCKED
ON TANYA'S DOOR

43:09.753 --> 43:12.031
AND SHE THOUGHT
I WAS THE AVON LADY.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.574
SO, GOOD JOB, LEO.

43:13.674 --> 43:15.576
UH, THANKS,
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

43:15.676 --> 43:17.330
EVER.

43:17.430 --> 43:18.496
CAN EVER WAIT
FOR A MINUTE OR SO?
UH-OH.

43:18.596 --> 43:21.876
I WAS THINKING
MAYBE WE SHOULD USE
SOME OF THAT DUST ON GLEN.

43:21.977 --> 43:24.688
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS
TO HAVE TO BE NERVOUS.

43:25.605 --> 43:27.401
WELL,
DO YOU THINK HE'S
GONNA TELL ANYBODY?

43:29.610 --> 43:31.723
NO.

43:31.823 --> 43:33.058
AND YOU TRUST HIM
COMPLETELY?

43:33.158 --> 43:34.018
YES.

43:34.118 --> 43:35.270
THEN SO DO WE.

43:35.370 --> 43:36.520
THANK GOD. WHEW.

43:36.620 --> 43:38.106
AND WHETHER WE THINK
IT'S SMART OR NOT,

43:38.206 --> 43:41.110
AT LEAST
YOU HAVE ONE PERSON
OUTSIDE THE FAMILY

43:41.210 --> 43:42.528
THAT YOU CAN
TALK TO.

43:42.628 --> 43:43.839
YEAH, LET'S JUST
KEEP IT TO ONE.
