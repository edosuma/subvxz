00:01.340 --> 00:03.649
Previously onSEAL Team....

00:03.690 --> 00:06.215
This is Sergeant
Percy Jacobs.

00:06.260 --> 00:08.125
The Army's Criminal
Investigative Division

00:08.180 --> 00:10.478
believe he was hit
by a fragmentation grenade.

00:10.530 --> 00:12.486
It was my frag. If my shoulder
wasn't messed up,

00:12.530 --> 00:13.781
that boy would still be alive.

00:13.830 --> 00:16.355
JASON:
That's Steve Porter's drill.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.129
He got something on it
during an op.

00:18.190 --> 00:21.148
The real story is
rare-earth metals.

00:21.190 --> 00:23.146
Remember Steve Porter's
drill bit?

00:23.190 --> 00:25.499
Well, I had it tested again.
So, either you lied to me

00:25.540 --> 00:27.849
or your lab guys lied to me.
I didn't lie to you.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.323
JASON:
Your boss, Cutter,

00:29.370 --> 00:31.065
people do a lot of funny things
when it comes to money.

00:31.110 --> 00:33.158
Maybe, uh, murder
a bunch of operators?

00:33.200 --> 00:34.155
This is Amanda Ellis.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.542
ABAD:
This is Abad Halani.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.852
My brother, Nouri Halani,

00:37.900 --> 00:40.425
he is the one who blew up
your commandos.

00:43.820 --> 00:46.129
ABAD:
This is Abad Halani.

00:46.170 --> 00:50.083
First, I congratulate you on the
capture of Hamid Gul Baladur.

00:50.130 --> 00:53.088
I never thought
he could be taken alive.

00:53.140 --> 00:57.520
Second, my brother,
Nouri Halani,

00:57.570 --> 01:00.926
he is the one who blew up
your commandos some weeks ago.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.279
MANDY:
Why are you telling me this?

01:03.320 --> 01:06.096
ABAD:
I want to deliver him to you.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.493
And we're sure
that's Abad Halani?

01:08.540 --> 01:09.928
DAVIS:
The voice recognition

01:09.980 --> 01:11.402
was a probable match.

01:11.460 --> 01:13.587
The guy did a pretty good job
scrambling the signal,

01:13.630 --> 01:15.678
but we managed to track it
to Northwest Pakistan.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.676
Halani Central.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.894
MANDY: You're offering
to betray your own brother?

01:20.950 --> 01:24.374
ABAD: He betrayed me
and all our people.

01:24.430 --> 01:27.126
My brother has gone mad.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.944
He wants to rule the world.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.128
He will kill anyone
he thinks is an enemy.

01:32.170 --> 01:34.218
He thinks I am an enemy.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.569
MANDY:
Why?

01:36.610 --> 01:40.740
ABAD: Because I do not want
to rule the world.

01:40.790 --> 01:43.258
SONNY: Hey, look,
it still don't make no sense.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.265
Big, bad Nouri Halani
kills Echo Team

01:45.320 --> 01:47.094
because they burnt down
some little poppy field?

01:47.150 --> 01:48.538
Come on.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.536
The bottom line is Nouri Halani
killed our Echo guys.

01:50.580 --> 01:51.888
ERIC:
Fact of the matter is

01:51.930 --> 01:53.921
Abad says he can
get us Nouri Halani.

01:53.980 --> 01:57.063
He's asked for an in-person
meeting tomorrow afternoon

01:57.110 --> 01:59.715
in Karachi, iron out
the particulars.

01:59.770 --> 02:02.068
Plan's for us to get eyes on him
at that meeting,

02:02.120 --> 02:04.111
_ surveil him
until we got NourI rolled up,

02:04.160 --> 02:05.764
and then roll up Abad
right after.

02:05.820 --> 02:08.118
First things first,
I got to get the Pakistanis

02:08.170 --> 02:10.422
to sign off on
me being there, so...

02:10.470 --> 02:11.812
And if they don't?

02:11.870 --> 02:13.599
You're gonna, uh, just call
the whole thing off?

02:13.650 --> 02:15.299
Actually, I was thinking
in that case,

02:15.350 --> 02:18.251
I just have to sneak in
with you guys.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.136
DAVIS:
Hey, suckers. Join you?

02:23.180 --> 02:26.047
SONNY:
Be my guest.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.958
You down with the mission?

02:30.010 --> 02:32.490
Ah, it's just a big waste
of time, if you ask me.

02:32.540 --> 02:35.270
We should just drop a big bomb
on them and call it a day.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.924
That is a very nice
international incident

02:36.980 --> 02:38.277
you are proposing.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.809
See, I like the sound
of that right there.

02:39.850 --> 02:42.842
It's got a little ring to it,
doesn't it

02:42.900 --> 02:46.028
I've been having trouble
getting in touch with Danny.

02:46.070 --> 02:49.028
Well, how long has it been
since you talked to him?

02:49.080 --> 02:50.684
Week.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.857
You want me
to reach out to him or...?

02:52.910 --> 02:54.298
No. No, no, no.
No?

02:54.340 --> 02:56.342
No. Thank you.Look, I tell you what.

02:56.390 --> 02:58.699
I owe a call
to my buddy Tyler.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.470
Mm-hmm.I will have him stop by
and check up on him.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.863
Hey, it'd be nice
to know he's alive.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.480
Well... sure.

03:06.530 --> 03:08.873
All right, all set.
Consider it done.

03:08.920 --> 03:10.524
Thank you.
There you go.

03:15.230 --> 03:18.358
STELLA: Hi, babe.
Sorry that I missed you.

03:18.410 --> 03:22.016
Again. Uh... know we
really need to talk.

03:22.070 --> 03:25.198
I just really need
to get to class on time today.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.196
I just really miss you.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.856
I really can't wait for us to be
in the same time zone again.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.596
Um, you said that
you were getting back

03:33.640 --> 03:36.108
the week after next.

03:36.170 --> 03:39.207
Do you remember that
MLA conference at Duke?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.478
It starts the exact same week.

03:41.520 --> 03:45.604
So I don't know that I will be
able to meet you when you land.

03:45.660 --> 03:47.434
Sorry. I... you know,
it would be helpful

03:47.480 --> 03:51.223
to know exactly when you land
outside of a five-day window.

03:51.270 --> 03:54.228
Wish we could talk
about this in person.

03:54.270 --> 03:55.828
I really have to go.

03:55.880 --> 03:57.928
Uh, be careful.

03:57.970 --> 04:00.791
I love you.
I'll talk to you soon.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.489
Bye.

04:15.340 --> 04:16.898
Hi.

04:16.950 --> 04:19.168
Hey. Good news.

04:19.210 --> 04:20.723
Guy I met in Islamabad

04:20.780 --> 04:22.645
is working at the Pakistani
Consulate in J-Bad.

04:22.690 --> 04:23.941
Hmm.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.422
Pretty sure
he's gonna be able

04:25.480 --> 04:27.380
to get me permission
to go into Karachi.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.998
Wow. Hey, that
is good news.

04:29.050 --> 04:31.393
Yeah. I'm gonna meet him
at his office in an hour.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.748
Hour? You want
some company?

04:32.790 --> 04:34.963
No. Just between spooks.

04:35.010 --> 04:37.171
So what do you
know about Xeon?

04:37.230 --> 04:39.926
Xeon Tactical?
The contractors?

04:39.970 --> 04:42.438
I_mean in an
offICIal capacrty.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.106
Oh, you want to know
what weknow about them.Yeah.

04:45.150 --> 04:48.586
Uh, well, like Blackwater
and DynCorp,

04:48.630 --> 04:50.939
they have their share
of bad press.

04:50.980 --> 04:53.585
It's heartily deserved.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.198
What about Cutter?

04:55.250 --> 04:59.243
Alan Cutter founded Xeon
about five years ago

04:59.290 --> 05:01.758
after he retired from
British Special Forces.

05:01.820 --> 05:04.163
Bit of an operator,
if you pardon the pun,

05:04.210 --> 05:06.166
but maybe it's just the accent?

05:06.210 --> 05:09.429
He's definitely not the kind
of guy you want to cross.

05:09.480 --> 05:11.994
Why are you asking me
about this, anyway?

05:12.050 --> 05:13.779
Why don't you ask
your new friend, Amy?

05:13.830 --> 05:14.819
She works for him.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.436
Where are you going with this?

05:18.490 --> 05:21.129
What if I told you that Xeon
may have been involved

05:21.190 --> 05:22.612
in Echo Team's deaths?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.968
Involved how?

05:25.020 --> 05:26.624
Well, Steve Porter
may have gotten himself

05:26.670 --> 05:28.183
into something
that got him killed.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.789
You know, Xeon mining
these rare-earth metals

05:31.850 --> 05:35.320
that he, uh, found while
he was, uh, you know,

05:35.370 --> 05:37.543
in the tunnels underneath
the fields they burned.

05:37.590 --> 05:39.023
Yeah, he took that
information to Amy,

05:39.070 --> 05:40.719
and Amy took it to Cutter,

05:40.770 --> 05:42.726
and I think that he,
uh, lied to her.

05:42.770 --> 05:45.375
Or I don't know, I think maybe
sh-she may have lied to me.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.079
I don't know yet, but...

05:47.120 --> 05:49.031
Okay, well, what does this
have to do with Echo Team?

05:49.080 --> 05:50.604
Well, you're gonna
go meet with Abad,

05:50.650 --> 05:52.698
so I figured that maybe you
could talk to him about it.

05:52.740 --> 05:55.732
Talk to him about what, Jason?
You don't have anything.

05:55.790 --> 05:58.566
Not yet.

05:58.610 --> 06:00.874
When you find something real...Mm-hmm.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.969
...I will be more than happy
to run it down for you.

06:04.010 --> 06:07.741
In the meantime,
watch out for Cutter.

07:23.570 --> 07:25.561
Ah, Mr. Hayes.

07:25.610 --> 07:27.430
Cutter.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.094
It's a pleasure
to see you again.

07:29.140 --> 07:30.482
I'm glad
you could stop by.

07:30.530 --> 07:32.748
What I have to say
is not gonna take too long.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.404
Well, take as long
as you like

07:34.450 --> 07:39.444
'cause I was just cozying in
to my afternoon dram.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.104
Can I interest you in some?

07:41.150 --> 07:43.402
No, I'm not interested.
So, buddy of mine,

07:43.460 --> 07:46.452
uh, and his team performed a-a
routine burn of a poppy field

07:46.500 --> 07:47.933
about 20 klicks east of here.

07:47.980 --> 07:49.322
Are you familiar
with that procedure?

07:49.380 --> 07:50.802
Yeah, absolutely.
We do it all the time.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.942
It's one of Xeon's main tasks
in theater, actually.

07:52.990 --> 07:56.505
My buddy, Steve Porter,
had that soil tested.

07:56.560 --> 07:58.164
Used this drill bit.
Mm-hmm.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.552
Sent it to your lab.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.773
Ah. I think_I know where
you're gomg With this.

08:01.820 --> 08:02.957
Right. So there's
lanthanum on there.

08:03.000 --> 08:04.297
You know that, right?Right. Jason...

08:04.350 --> 08:06.124
Right. So why would you
or one of your people

08:06.180 --> 08:08.125
tell my buddy, Steve Porter,
that there wasn't?

08:08.180 --> 08:10.171
Why would you say
something like that?

08:10.220 --> 08:13.178
First of all,
I'm sorry about Steve

08:13.230 --> 08:15.357
and all your comrades
who perished

08:15.400 --> 08:18.005
in this bloody,
fractious country.

08:18.060 --> 08:20.449
But what you've
just learned from that

08:20.500 --> 08:23.879
is how immensely giving
it could be.

08:23.930 --> 08:27.548
Place is a virtual gold mine,

08:27.590 --> 08:32.061
for those who got the eyes to
see it and the means to take it.

08:32.120 --> 08:36.079
So you knew there was lanthanum
in that soil?

08:36.120 --> 08:40.989
I'd be a poor CEO of a modern,
diversified contracting company

08:41.040 --> 08:42.689
if I didn't.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.073
Lanthanides.

08:45.130 --> 08:46.995
Rare-earth metals.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.570
Why'd you lie to Steve?

08:55.620 --> 08:56.962
Hmm?

08:57.010 --> 08:58.489
We didn't.

08:58.530 --> 09:00.612
What Steve found we all found.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.615
Xeon, KNR, China National.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.092
It's no secret.

09:04.150 --> 09:08.268
Traces of lanthanides, yes,
but traces only.

09:09.940 --> 09:13.637
There's no great vein
of precious minerals

09:13.680 --> 09:15.898
running under that
poppy field, Jason,

09:15.940 --> 09:18.408
or any poppy field
in Nangarhar Province.

09:18.470 --> 09:20.335
Please. Take a read.

09:20.380 --> 09:25.773
That's the history of Xeon's
failed exploration in this area.

09:25.820 --> 09:27.776
I told Steve the same thing.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.822
You talked to Steve?

09:29.870 --> 09:32.998
Yeah, sure. He came to see me.
He sat right where you are.

09:33.050 --> 09:36.747
You're saying that Steve knew

09:36.790 --> 09:38.781
there was lanthanum
in that soil?

09:38.830 --> 09:40.969
Yeah, of course.

09:41.010 --> 09:45.356
Did... did Amy Nelson
tell you otherwise?

09:48.100 --> 09:49.977
Are you sure
you don't want that drink?

09:50.020 --> 09:51.624
No.

09:51.670 --> 09:54.366
Come back anytime.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.815
Hi.Hey. How you doing?

10:04.860 --> 10:06.634
Good. Listen, you keep
track of all the stuff

10:06.690 --> 10:07.816
we get from home, right?

10:07.860 --> 10:09.031
Yeah. That's my job.
Of course.

10:09.080 --> 10:10.775
Right, and all the stuff
that goes home, too,

10:10.820 --> 10:12.162
just in case, you know,
something happens,

10:12.220 --> 10:13.517
like, whatever,
you know?

10:13.560 --> 10:15.255
Well, this just took
a very morbid turn.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.516
Um, yeah, I keep track

10:16.570 --> 10:17.730
of everything
that's in the hooches.

10:17.790 --> 10:18.825
Everything?

10:18.870 --> 10:20.269
Everything.
It's my bedtime reading.

10:20.310 --> 10:23.484
Right. Even Echo Team?

10:23.530 --> 10:24.838
I don't have that information.

10:24.880 --> 10:26.188
Can you get it?

10:26.230 --> 10:28.312
What do you need, Jason?

10:28.360 --> 10:29.964
Look, there may
have been something

10:30.020 --> 10:31.351
that was in Steve Porter's gear,

10:31.410 --> 10:35.016
something that went
back home to Cindy.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.528
Uh, yeah, I'll check in
with my Echo Team counterpart.

10:37.590 --> 10:39.842
If she put it online,
I can get it for you.

10:39.900 --> 10:41.800
Full list of everything
that went home to Steve.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.806
Okay.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.507
Thanks, Davis.

10:47.550 --> 10:49.598
You're welcome.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.216
Perry.
Looking for you.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.955
Well, here I am.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.651
Am I interrupting?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.656
No.

11:05.700 --> 11:09.136
Dust. Gets in everywhere,
don't it?

11:09.190 --> 11:11.613
That it does.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.661
You talk_ to the CID
Investigator yet

11:16.710 --> 11:19.588
In a couple hours.

11:19.630 --> 11:22.281
It shouldn't be too bad.

11:22.330 --> 11:25.151
When a civilian gets killed,
the DoD needs to be able to say

11:25.200 --> 11:27.065
that it _ruled out
neghgence.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.634
It's gonna be
what it's gonna be.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.725
I'm supposed to send over
that ISR footage later today.

11:34.780 --> 11:37.647
Just got to put it
on the hard drive.
Yeah.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.032
You know, it
still amazes me

11:39.080 --> 11:41.344
what you can see on
those MTS cameras.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.778
Especially in
the daylight.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.172
Uh-huh.

11:44.220 --> 11:45.562
You can see everything.

11:47.750 --> 11:50.708
So I can see... when
you threw that frag.

11:52.710 --> 11:55.611
I can see how
you threw It.

11:55.670 --> 11:58.537
I can see how
It hurt you.

11:58.580 --> 12:01.629
Shoulder...
thatshoulder.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.537
That shoulder that you
hurt that night in Yemen.

12:04.590 --> 12:07.366
And you deployed anyway.

12:12.250 --> 12:15.026
Well, I just want
you to know...

12:15.080 --> 12:18.516
that that footage will
never see the light of day.

12:18.560 --> 12:21.165
They can have everything else,
but they can't have that.

12:23.350 --> 12:25.079
You'd do that for me?

12:25.130 --> 12:27.473
In a heartbeat.

12:30.880 --> 12:35.226
Okay, let me tell you
how this is gonna go down.

12:35.270 --> 12:38.000
You touch one frame
of that tape, and it's you

12:38.060 --> 12:40.312
who's gonna be sitting in front
of CID, you understand?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.315
Ray...

12:41.360 --> 12:43.794
Lisa, I love you,
like family.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.317
You know that.

12:45.370 --> 12:49.238
But what I did...
that boy?

12:49.290 --> 12:52.373
That's on me.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.378
And whatever comes,
I'm fine with it.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.376
That's how you
want to play it?

12:57.420 --> 12:59.809
That's how it's gonna play.

12:59.860 --> 13:01.339
Okay.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.723
All right, then.

13:03.780 --> 13:05.862
Send the tape.

13:25.890 --> 13:28.711
Miss Ellis, I am sorry
we have to meet

13:28.760 --> 13:30.068
under such conditions.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.886
My name is Abad Halani.

13:32.940 --> 13:35.238
I know who you are.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.151
Tea?

13:40.210 --> 13:42.337
Where is my driver?

13:42.380 --> 13:44.166
My men are watching him.

13:44.210 --> 13:46.428
I assure you
he is completely unharmed.

13:46.470 --> 13:48.028
I want to see him.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.253
That is not possible
right now.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.996
But... but I give you
my word.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.397
Forgive me for taking
such precautions.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.261
My brother has spies everywhere.

14:00.310 --> 14:03.529
I only want to talk.

14:03.580 --> 14:06.799
Please, take some tea

14:06.840 --> 14:09.798
and a biscuit...

14:09.840 --> 14:11.888
and accept my apologies.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.978
I am grateful
for your presence.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.496
You went to all this trouble,
so talk.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.596
I need your help.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.814
Right.
Problems with your brother.

14:27.860 --> 14:30.511
You'd like us to kill him
for you.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.994
Yes.

14:35.390 --> 14:38.735
In exchange, I want to know
about Echo Team.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.269
For years,
I've counseled

14:40.310 --> 14:43.359
my brother
not to target Americans.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.618
Even when you began
to arrest our people,

14:45.660 --> 14:47.616
I told him we should
waIt you out.

14:47.660 --> 14:52.279
Then, some weeks ago, your
commandos burned a poppy field

14:52.320 --> 14:54.925
belonging to one of
my brother's people.

14:57.070 --> 15:01.029
My brother got tired of waiting.

15:01.070 --> 15:06.281
Echo Team burns the field,
Nouri burns Echo Team.

15:06.340 --> 15:08.808
Sounds like Nouri's
losing his grip.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.593
My brother...

15:14.650 --> 15:17.778
refuses to change
with the times.

15:27.530 --> 15:30.442
Now...

15:30.490 --> 15:33.789
let me tell you
how to kill him.

15:36.890 --> 15:39.279
I'll show you
where to find him.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.971
[helicopter blades whirring
in distance]

16:35.290 --> 16:37.338
SONNY: I want to know
how he dared.

16:37.380 --> 16:38.597
RAY:
We got stupid.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.289
CLAY:
Or lucky. She's alive.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.558
JASON: No, no, we got
played, brothers. Here.

16:42.610 --> 16:43.941
Some coffee.
You all right?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.422
Yes. It's my fault.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.254
I knew that my contact
at the consulate

16:47.310 --> 16:48.607
was with Pakistani intelligence.

16:48.650 --> 16:50.436
I should have known
the Halanis owned him.

16:50.480 --> 16:52.209
That's the whole reason
for the Karachi idea.

16:52.270 --> 16:54.568
I mean, Abad knew you'd
have to contact 151.

16:54.620 --> 16:56.099
No, he's no dummy.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.096
Well, we caught
a break, actually.

16:58.140 --> 17:00.836
My little adventure
saved us a day or two.

17:00.880 --> 17:04.236
Pretty important days,
as it turns out.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.408
So the Halanis normally hole up
here, in the Swat Valley,

17:07.460 --> 17:09.883
north of Peshawar, in Pakistan.

17:09.940 --> 17:11.498
They're basically untouchable.

17:11.550 --> 17:15.065
But once a year, they make
the difficult pilgrimage

17:15.120 --> 17:18.078
through the mountains
to the village of Ayub Kheyl,

17:18.120 --> 17:21.078
where their father was born,
pay their respects at his grave.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.771
Our clever friend Abad
convinced his brother

17:23.820 --> 17:25.594
to make the visit now.

17:25.650 --> 17:27.299
When exactly is "now"?

17:27.350 --> 17:28.829
Nouri's already
on the move.

17:28.870 --> 17:30.690
Abad will meet him in Peshawar.

17:30.740 --> 17:33.561
They'll be in AK. village
tomorrow morning.

17:33.610 --> 17:34.781
Hot diggity.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.138
Two for the price of one.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.659
No, Abad will

17:37.700 --> 17:40.134
plead illness and abandon
the pilgrimage in Pakistan.

17:40.180 --> 17:42.569
He's not stupid.
He knows we'd roll him up, too.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.180
All right, so Nouri crosses
into Afghanistan alone.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.698
Yeah, but with
how many guys?

17:47.760 --> 17:50.103
Um, a dozen guys,
20 at the most.

17:50.150 --> 17:51.629
Just his personal
bodyguard.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.547
Am I the only one that thinks
this is too good to be true?

17:53.590 --> 17:55.581
Nope. No, I'm with you.

17:55.630 --> 17:57.063
This is,
it's way too convenient.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.374
I mean, how are we gonna
trust Abad Halani?

17:59.420 --> 18:01.593
Yeah, I got to agree
with Blondie over here.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.948
Something don't
smell right.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.548
JASON: It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, okay?

18:04.600 --> 18:05.680
Nouri's our
ace of spades.

18:05.730 --> 18:07.072
I'm-a do anything
I can to get him.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.200
So you can pop a drone,

18:08.260 --> 18:09.818
get a clear
line of sight?Yeah.

18:09.870 --> 18:12.168
Surrounded by hills,
but A.K. itself is in a valley.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.471
Good. Can you get that approved?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.862
ERIC: Yeah,
General Cook's back in DC.

18:14.910 --> 18:16.866
I'll give him a call
in a couple hours.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.478
He can digest the news
with his Wheaties.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.919
And that leaves
the Agency and Belding.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.962
I got this.

18:38.550 --> 18:40.506
Senior Chief Perry?

18:40.550 --> 18:42.541
Come on.

18:44.550 --> 18:48.168
Sorry. You would not believe
the paperwork.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.815
My own personal war.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.646
I don't envy you.

18:52.690 --> 18:55.648
Sit.

18:55.690 --> 18:57.646
All right.

18:57.700 --> 19:00.521
So, I've reviewed your
statement about the events

19:00.570 --> 19:04.358
at Forogh Curative Hospital
in Jalalabad last Thursday,

19:04.400 --> 19:06.914
and the statements of
Lieutenant Commander Blackburn,

19:06.970 --> 19:10.315
Master Chief Hayes and
Sailor Clay Spenser.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.271
I've also reviewed the
statements of the family

19:12.320 --> 19:14.959
of the deceased,
Jandol Al-Akbar,

19:15.020 --> 19:17.272
or a rough translation
of the same.

19:17.330 --> 19:20.197
Now, I'm still waiting on
the surveillance footage

19:20.240 --> 19:22.845
to be provided by Logistics
Specialist Lisa Davis...

19:22.900 --> 19:24.845
I want to add to my statement.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.549
You what?

19:26.600 --> 19:28.204
I want to enlarge my statement.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.718
What you have there
is just the mission details.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.557
Okay.

19:35.730 --> 19:37.812
I, um, I hurt my arm.

19:37.870 --> 19:39.861
My shoulder.

19:39.910 --> 19:42.868
That's why the grenade
went wide.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.782
I couldn't hold on to it.

19:48.830 --> 19:52.095
I see. W-Well, I'll make
a note of that.

19:52.140 --> 19:55.314
I don't think you understand,
Sergeant Jacobs.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.442
That's why the boy died.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.229
Because of my injury.

19:59.280 --> 20:02.579
You see...

20:02.630 --> 20:05.588
I injured my shoulder four
months ago, while on mission.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.678
And I was scheduled
to see a doctor

20:07.720 --> 20:10.029
to determine if I was fit
for deployment.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.628
I didn't see that doctor.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.899
I deployed aanay.

20:14.950 --> 20:16.463
I also led my team leader
to believe

20:16.510 --> 20:18.558
that my shoulder was healed.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.909
And now there's a little boy
lying in the ground

20:20.950 --> 20:23.168
who shouldn't be there.

20:24.910 --> 20:27.561
Have you seen a doctor
since you've been in country?

20:27.610 --> 20:30.170
No, I haven't.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.619
You really should.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.480
I myself have
a bad rotator cuff.

20:33.530 --> 20:35.612
Should have
seen a doctor.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.799
Now I'm looking
at surgery.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.967
That's too bad.

20:40.020 --> 20:42.238
Mm, whatever.
Could be worse, right?

20:42.280 --> 20:45.499
So is there anything else
you want to add, to the report?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.191
No, that's everything.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.858
Okay. I really don't need
to wait on the video.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.984
My review and recommendation is
that this issue is now closed.

20:57.030 --> 20:59.464
The family of the
deceased will receive

20:59.510 --> 21:03.298
a condolence compensation in the
amount of 5,000 US. dollars.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.479
_ No further action
is expected In this case.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.771
Thanks for coming in.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.821
That's it?
Yep.

21:15.050 --> 21:17.610
With all due respect,
a boy is dead.

21:19.190 --> 21:22.000
Fortunes of war,
Senior Chief.

21:22.060 --> 21:25.018
But I expect you know
that better than me.

21:25.060 --> 21:28.848
You really should let a
doctor look at that shoulder.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.116
Hey, what you looking for?

21:43.170 --> 21:45.684
Oh. Sorry, I didn't,
I didn't know you were in here.

21:45.730 --> 21:46.867
Some batteries, I...

21:46.910 --> 21:48.423
NODs are just about due.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.471
I got you.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.696
Thank you.
Yeah.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.308
Hey, how's Stella?

22:01.230 --> 22:02.572
Oh, God, that good?Uh...

22:02.620 --> 22:05.407
No, it's just, uh, she's
been kind of avoiding me.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.099
I don't know, she...

22:07.150 --> 22:10.881
Last few conversations just
haven't really gone so well.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.750
She thinks I'm being
jealous, and I'm not.

22:12.800 --> 22:14.233
I'm just...

22:14.280 --> 22:16.362
really not able to talk
to her about my life,

22:16.420 --> 22:18.320
and so I'm sort of
overdomg it on hers.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.893
Hey, look, being
out here is hard.

22:19.940 --> 22:21.635
I haven't talked
to Danny in a week.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.819
And I'm starting to lose
my mind a little bit.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.463
Or maybe
it's the distance, or...

22:27.520 --> 22:30.944
I don't know, maybe this life
and love, they don't...

22:31.000 --> 22:32.558
they don't go together.

22:32.610 --> 22:33.736
Maybe.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.736
Maybe not.

22:35.780 --> 22:37.736
I mean, maybe...
you just need someone

22:37.790 --> 22:39.655
who shares the same life,
you know?

22:41.960 --> 22:43.746
I mean, I mean "one" does.

22:45.180 --> 22:46.966
You know, I'm gonna, uh, I'm...

22:47.010 --> 22:48.227
I'm gonna let,
I'm gonna let you

22:48.270 --> 22:49.407
get back to your stuff.Yeah, okay.

22:49.450 --> 22:51.145
Now, this is...

22:56.850 --> 22:58.408
Paul.

22:58.460 --> 23:02.373
Don't believe you and I have
anything left to talk about.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.240
Whether you
like it or not,

23:04.290 --> 23:07.157
your "fake story"
has already allowed us

23:07.210 --> 23:10.202
to take down
some really bad people.

23:10.250 --> 23:11.979
Funny you should say that.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.123
Story I heard recently,
about your guys taking down

23:15.170 --> 23:16.990
the sniper who killed
Salim Hakan--

23:17.040 --> 23:19.645
you know, the one
you told me was still alive--

23:19.700 --> 23:24.262
anyway, I hear that in
the course of running him down,

23:24.310 --> 23:28.178
one of your guys mis—tossed
a grenade,

23:28.230 --> 23:30.482
ended up killing
some local kid.

23:30.530 --> 23:33.317
Now, stop me if any of this
sounds familiar.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.362
I don't know anything about it.

23:38.370 --> 23:39.496
There, you see?

23:39.540 --> 23:41.929
That's lying.

23:41.980 --> 23:43.459
You know how I can tell?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.502
'Cause it's so easy for you.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.805
You got a story,
then run with it.

23:49.860 --> 23:51.555
I will, thanks.

23:51.600 --> 23:54.558
What do you want, Paul?

23:54.600 --> 23:57.205
My integrity back.

23:57.260 --> 23:58.818
This story gonna give it to you?

24:00.040 --> 24:02.383
Can't hurt.

24:05.700 --> 24:07.395
So, A.K. village is here.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.305
We're gonna helo in, tuck
back behind this ridge,

24:09.360 --> 24:10.873
two klicks to the northeast,
walk in.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.480
All right. That-that ridge
is, what, 500 meters?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.134
Yeah, 500. It's not
our problem, though.

24:15.190 --> 24:16.839
We're gonna follow this dry
riverbed straight into town.

24:16.890 --> 24:18.016
Piece of cake.

24:18.060 --> 24:19.493
Famous last words.

24:19.540 --> 24:21.053
Oh, if you've got
a better plan, brother,

24:21.110 --> 24:22.327
I would love to hear it.

24:22.370 --> 24:23.974
Drone in, death from above.

24:24.020 --> 24:25.499
And lose the chance
to interrogate him?

24:25.550 --> 24:28.155
All right, everybody,
let's gather round.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.668
Just got word

24:30.730 --> 24:32.243
in from the higher-ups.

24:32.290 --> 24:33.632
Good news is,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.898
we are a go for Nouri Halani.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.689
Yeah, bad news is, no ground op.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.686
Told you.Sorry, guys.
ERIC: At 0400,

24:41.740 --> 24:44.208
a Predator drone fitted with
a Hellfire air-to-ground missile

24:44.260 --> 24:46.649
will be launched
from Jalalabad airfield.

24:46.700 --> 24:49.863
We'll have the live feed piped
through up here, and everyone

24:49.920 --> 24:51.171
is welcome to watch.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.562
So we do all the damn work...

24:52.620 --> 24:54.042
Running down the guys
who killed our brothers,

24:54.100 --> 24:55.351
and some drone jockey in Nevada

24:55.400 --> 24:57.220
gets to be the one
to pull the trigger.

24:57.270 --> 24:59.579
It's better than nothing.SONNY: Well, the
good news is,

24:59.620 --> 25:03.238
we do get to watch a very
exciting episode of "Kill TV."

25:03.280 --> 25:04.975
I'll get some popcorn.

25:21.690 --> 25:25.035
Eight minutes till the drone's
over the target.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.389
Appreciate the update.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.919
You have your meeting?

25:30.960 --> 25:32.951
Oh, yeah.

25:34.960 --> 25:37.178
Should I ask
how it went?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.614
Perfect.

25:42.670 --> 25:46.538
Case closed.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.714
Yeah.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.751
Closure, right?

25:57.640 --> 26:00.279
There's just one more person
I got to talk to.

26:00.340 --> 26:02.808
Jason.

26:02.860 --> 26:06.899
Like I said: closure.

26:07.780 --> 26:09.736
You coming?

26:09.780 --> 26:11.771
Yeah.

26:16.530 --> 26:18.521
Yeah...

26:26.010 --> 26:28.888
You know, I was pretty
worried about you, before.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.402
You didn't even know
I was missmg.

26:35.460 --> 26:39.282
Still would've been
worried about you.

26:39.330 --> 26:41.321
Thank you.

26:43.680 --> 26:46.763
To be honest with you,

26:46.820 --> 26:49.038
I was a little worried
about me, too.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.513
Yeah.

26:50.560 --> 26:54.348
But I guess all's well
that ends well.

26:54.390 --> 26:55.948
Well, it's not gonna end well

26:56.000 --> 26:58.696
for Nouri Halani
in about T-minus five.

26:58.740 --> 27:03.393
At least we're getting
justice for Echo Team.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.058
I just think there's something
else that's going on here, too.

27:07.100 --> 27:08.579
I went and I saw Cutter.

27:08.620 --> 27:09.962
Okay.

27:10.010 --> 27:11.568
How'd that go

27:11.630 --> 27:13.279
Yeah, with velvet gloves.

27:13.320 --> 27:17.279
Steve went to him, to talk
about these rare-earth metals.

27:17.330 --> 27:21.232
XEON, they've been looking
for this stuff for years.

27:21.290 --> 27:23.099
All they came up with
was traces.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.764
There was nothing there.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.769
I mean, Cutter even showed
me the-the field reports.

27:28.820 --> 27:30.594
But you think he's lying.

27:30.640 --> 27:33.518
Mandy, they knew each other.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.949
Okay? They talked to each other.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.423
A few days later, Steve is dead.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.609
ERIC:
Drone's over target,

27:41.660 --> 27:44.003
in case anyone's interested.

27:46.570 --> 27:48.743
CLAY: Oh, yeah, he got the old
security detail out front there.

27:48.790 --> 27:50.746
SONNY: Hmm, there's
the big guy right there.

27:50.790 --> 27:52.348
Time to go night,
night for good.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.708
JASON: Wait a second,
what is that?

27:53.750 --> 27:55.479
Are those

27:55.540 --> 27:57.531
What's a bus
doing there?

27:57.580 --> 27:58.569
MANDY: Could be
school kids on the way

27:58.630 --> 28:00.143
to Khost, stopping in
for the night.

28:00.200 --> 28:00.939
RAY: Wait a minute,
you think there

28:00.980 --> 28:02.140
are kids in the compound?

28:02.200 --> 28:05.101
There's a big madrasa
school up in Gardez.

28:05.160 --> 28:06.104
Still civilians.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.548
DAVIS: We've
got 14 hours

28:07.590 --> 28:09.376
hover time, so the drone
can stay over the target

28:09.420 --> 28:10.762
until tomorrow afternoon.

28:10.810 --> 28:12.152
Ah, we wait a few hours, then,

28:12.210 --> 28:13.552
we take him
when the CIVIlians leave.

28:13.600 --> 28:15.079
If they leave.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.849
I say we wait.

28:16.910 --> 28:20.255
Even if they do, three hours?
That village is wide awake.

28:24.090 --> 28:25.216
Yes, sir.

28:25.260 --> 28:27.262
Well, there's that, huh?

28:27.310 --> 28:29.084
CLAY: That's it?JASON: Yeah. That's it.

28:29.140 --> 28:30.357
That's it, we're scrubbing?

28:30.400 --> 28:32.049
Command is not gonna
risk the possibility

28:32.100 --> 28:33.579
of collateral damage.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.394
Not even for Nouri Halani.That's right.

28:35.450 --> 28:36.747
ERIC:
Copy that, sir.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.926
Well, that's
it, fellas.

28:37.970 --> 28:39.403
Hope you all enjoyed the show.

28:39.450 --> 28:40.530
SONNY:
Well, I think I speak

28:40.580 --> 28:42.400
for the rest of us,
in that

28:42.450 --> 28:43.667
tonight's episode
of Kill TV

28:43.720 --> 28:45.403
really sucked.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.634
Hold up! Hold up.

28:52.680 --> 28:55.763
Oh, here we go with another
Hayes three-pointer.

28:55.820 --> 28:57.242
JASON:
Look, the brass
shot us down

28:57.300 --> 28:59.723
when, uh, there was
an option of a drone.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.509
Now that there is
no drone,

29:01.560 --> 29:02.686
I say we go in.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.901
Still the issue
of civilian casualties.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.564
No, we'll go in by foot.

29:06.610 --> 29:08.737
We avoid whoever, and-and the
kids, and we take Nouri alive.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.394
I mean, we got to see
what he's all about, right?

29:10.440 --> 29:11.748
ERIC:
I might actually be able

29:11.790 --> 29:13.519
to make a case for that
with General Cook.

29:13.570 --> 29:16.095
I mean, with no kill mission,
sure, we can,

29:16.140 --> 29:17.573
but you guys are forgetting:

29:17.620 --> 29:19.008
by the time you get there,
it'll be light.

29:19.060 --> 29:20.743
Right. We're talking
a daytime hit.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.222
It's a daytime hit.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.100
The Black Hawks are still
out with Charlie Team, yeah?

29:24.150 --> 29:27.369
So, what are we gonna do, take
the bus in, like those kids did?

29:27.410 --> 29:28.889
DEA's got Hueys, right?

29:28.940 --> 29:30.282
Yeah, a couple, actually.

29:30.330 --> 29:31.934
Let's call them up,
let's use them.

29:31.980 --> 29:37.282
I mean, I want Nouri, we all do,
but that's Taliban country.

29:37.340 --> 29:39.638
I mean, there's not
a fighting age male

29:39.690 --> 29:41.112
within a hundred
kilometers

29:41.170 --> 29:42.819
who doesn't sympathize
with the Halanis.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.418
If you guys get caught
on the ground...

29:44.470 --> 29:46.426
Then, we better
move fast, right?

29:46.480 --> 29:47.606
Ray, you prepped the mission?

29:47.650 --> 29:50.255
Ready to go.
Ready to go.

29:50.310 --> 29:52.084
You sure you want to do this?

29:52.130 --> 29:55.133
Well, ask me again over
breakfast in about six hours.

29:55.180 --> 29:57.432
Well, taking Nouri Halani
isn't gonna be easy.

29:57.490 --> 30:00.311
He's survived for 30 years
as a fugitive.

30:00.360 --> 30:03.352
First from the Soviets,
then, from Kabul, now us.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.708
Abad told me he uses surrogates
whenever he travels.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.011
Surrogates?
You mean doubles?

30:07.060 --> 30:08.664
Yeah, just make sure
you get the right one.

30:08.710 --> 30:10.325
I'll get him, and I'm
serious about breakfast.

30:10.370 --> 30:12.361
You know, we got to still
talk about Cutter and Steve.

30:12.410 --> 30:13.809
Yeah, I mean, I'll be here.

30:13.850 --> 30:15.192
You just better
make it back.

32:11.490 --> 32:14.220
TOC, this is Bravo 1,
we're passing Firebird.

32:18.500 --> 32:21.276
Copy, Bravo 1, no movement
outside the target building.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.661
JASON:
Copy that.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.503
There it is: bad guy's
home away from home.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.079
Bravo 1, you've got
movement outside

32:43.130 --> 32:44.119
one of the smaller buildings.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.512
Just up ahead
on the left.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.966
Copy that, TOC.
I've got three noncombatants.

32:54.010 --> 32:56.570
Look like students,
up for morning prayer.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.316
That's less than 15 yards
from the target.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.749
Less than ideal.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.268
Look, less talk.
Let's get to work.

33:22.780 --> 33:23.553
Bravo 1,

33:23.610 --> 33:24.508
you have multiple unknowns

33:24.560 --> 33:25.811
headed your direction.

34:26.060 --> 34:28.699
Bravo 1, we've got movement
coming towards you.

34:30.450 --> 34:32.236
Working it.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.714
20 seconds till entry.

35:17.810 --> 35:20.278
Cover me!

35:24.330 --> 35:26.378
Burn it!

35:34.300 --> 35:35.426
Don't shoot!

35:35.480 --> 35:37.289
Somebody cuff him.

35:37.350 --> 35:39.477
I'm on it.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.320
Bravo 1, be aware, you've got
three squirters at the back.

35:58.370 --> 35:59.621
One of them could be Nouri.

35:59.670 --> 36:01.456
Bravo 4, Bravo 6, on me.

36:14.950 --> 36:16.554
Go!

36:25.530 --> 36:27.919
I've got two squirters
heading north.

36:27.960 --> 36:29.780
I got two more squirters.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.740
Last man.

36:48.980 --> 36:51.244
CLAY:
Is it him?

36:51.290 --> 36:53.372
It's not him.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.298
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
Negative ID. on the squirters.

36:56.340 --> 36:58.513
Negative ID. on Nouri Halani.
He's using doubles.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.993
Roger that.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.553
RAY:
This is Bravo 2.

37:01.610 --> 37:03.828
We've got squirters pinned down,
two of them,

37:03.870 --> 37:04.905
possibly Nouri Halani.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.302
JASON:
This is Bravo 1.

37:33.330 --> 37:36.117
RAY:
We've got Halani doubles,
left and right!

37:36.160 --> 37:38.151
I got right, you got left!

38:02.840 --> 38:04.796
RAY:
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.058
Negative ID. on our end.

38:15.590 --> 38:17.546
Yeah. Jackpot.
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

38:17.590 --> 38:18.989
I pass Camaro.

38:20.990 --> 38:23.208
That's it.

38:30.300 --> 38:31.471
Gotcha.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.737
Bravo 1,

38:32.780 --> 38:35.954
confirming positive ID.
on Nouri Halani.

38:37.960 --> 38:40.269
JASON:
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

38:40.310 --> 38:42.915
Passing Eldorado.
Compound secure.

38:44.230 --> 38:46.539
Roger, 1. Exfil helos
are en route,

38:46.580 --> 38:48.571
on the X in five.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.668
What'd he say?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.585
Hey! What'd you say?

38:53.630 --> 38:54.881
What'd he say?He said he hopes...

38:54.940 --> 38:56.362
he hopes we turn
into black dust.

38:56.420 --> 38:57.717
May God make this

38:57.770 --> 38:59.931
your day of judgment.

38:59.980 --> 39:02.335
Echo Team. Echo Team!

39:02.380 --> 39:04.598
You took out
SIX of my guys.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.686
Huh?

39:05.730 --> 39:07.686
Six of my brothers!

39:07.730 --> 39:09.038
What is Echo Team?

39:10.300 --> 39:12.382
You put a hit on
them in Jalalabad

39:12.430 --> 39:13.647
two months ago.

39:13.690 --> 39:15.089
Echo Team.

39:17.090 --> 39:19.172
Your deaths...

39:19.220 --> 39:22.951
are always welcome.Oh, yeah?

39:23.010 --> 39:24.398
Tell me about Cutter.

39:24.440 --> 39:26.317
The Englishman?Yeah, the Englishman.

39:26.360 --> 39:27.918
Cutter!

39:30.280 --> 39:31.759
How did you know I was here?

39:31.800 --> 39:33.233
How do you know
about Cutter?

39:33.280 --> 39:34.759
How do you know
about Cutter?!

My brother Abad.

39:39.150 --> 39:41.368
He must have told you
where to find me.

39:41.420 --> 39:44.116
He said he was sick.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.898
Where the hell
did these guys come from?

39:49.950 --> 39:52.589
Must've put out an APB,

39:52.650 --> 39:54.254
alerted the village.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.120
Hell, the entire valley.

39:56.170 --> 39:58.559
Bravo 1, be advised, you've got
several dozen hostiles

39:58.610 --> 40:00.430
approaching at speed
from the northeast.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.301
A hundred, 200 meters.

Copy, TOC. Exfil.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.445
Helos coming in.

40:10.490 --> 40:12.833
ISR spots guys
moving on our six.

Smoke 'em!

40:21.630 --> 40:23.848
JASON:
Moving up quick! Let's go!

41:05.200 --> 41:07.361
