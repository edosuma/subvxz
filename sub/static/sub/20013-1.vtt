00:39.439 --> 00:43.809
Crowd:

00:49.549 --> 00:52.418
Male reporter: Another
unexpected creature attack.

00:52.420 --> 00:56.822
Mind controlled by the mad
scientist doctor Mindskull.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.758
Female reporter: Mindskull's threat
to destroy our peaceful planet

00:59.760 --> 01:02.227
has become a reality.

01:02.662 --> 01:05.497
A Neo animal reality.

01:05.498 --> 01:08.400
General short: We found the
location where Mindskull

01:08.402 --> 01:12.104
has been gathering power
for his new world weapon.

01:12.106 --> 01:15.674
The weapon that can
destroy us all.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.609
No more questions.

01:20.547 --> 01:24.116
This evil is growing.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.753
And until we find someone with
the power and the strength

01:27.755 --> 01:31.156
we need to fight back...

01:31.158 --> 01:33.826
Our world will fall...

01:33.828 --> 01:35.394
To Mindskull.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.864
Crowd:

02:11.866 --> 02:15.200
Tonight's warrior has a chance

02:15.202 --> 02:18.570
at taking his opponent's
life crystal!

02:23.910 --> 02:25.644
<i>Now here it is,</i>

02:25.646 --> 02:28.380
the golden demon beast

02:28.382 --> 02:29.715
from hell!

02:30.885 --> 02:33.785
Crowd:

02:34.921 --> 02:38.223
Announcer:
<i>Open the gates!</i>

02:56.843 --> 02:58.677
Crowd:

03:21.267 --> 03:26.905
Crowd:
<i>Pig! Pig! Pig! Pig!</i>

03:26.907 --> 03:30.709
I smell bacon!

03:33.614 --> 03:36.348
Crowd:
<i>Pig! Pig! Pig!</i>

Crowd:

Crowd:

04:17.824 --> 04:19.024
Argh...!

04:48.888 --> 04:52.391
Crowd:

04:53.626 --> 04:54.726
Ahh!

05:06.773 --> 05:08.006
Ugh!

05:13.314 --> 05:14.546
Ahh!

05:24.724 --> 05:26.058
Gladiator:
Ugh!

05:26.060 --> 05:27.926
Crowd:

05:40.507 --> 05:41.506
Column five.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.841
Column five just fell.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.009
The fat guy there.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.877
Get a close-up of the fat guy.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.647
Crowd:

05:48.649 --> 05:50.649
Pig:
<i>Please...</i>

05:50.651 --> 05:53.952
Get me outta here!

05:55.456 --> 05:56.555
Ahh!

06:01.929 --> 06:03.061
Huh?

06:15.109 --> 06:16.141
Agh!

06:41.468 --> 06:42.667
Ergh!

06:47.007 --> 06:48.407
Ergh!

06:51.677 --> 06:52.844
Ah!

06:53.913 --> 06:55.947
Hah!

07:08.762 --> 07:10.829
Whoa. Whoa.
What's going on?

07:10.831 --> 07:12.597
You can't come in here.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.013
Ahhh!

07:28.015 --> 07:29.514
He's the one.

07:29.516 --> 07:30.682
Take him down.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.534
A reformed genetics Nac

07:49.536 --> 07:52.504
specifically bred,
conditioned and trained

07:52.506 --> 07:55.207
in all military tactics
is now the key

07:55.209 --> 07:57.209
to stopping Mindskull.

07:57.211 --> 07:58.643
But at what cost?

07:58.645 --> 08:00.612
Protestors:

08:00.614 --> 08:03.014
They don't care about our world!

08:03.016 --> 08:06.485
No Neo, no Neo, no Neo!

08:06.487 --> 08:08.987
Humans don't work with Neos!

08:08.989 --> 08:12.524
All Neo animals must be put down
after capture.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.726
The risk is just too high.

08:17.163 --> 08:22.534
We are by no means working with
the Neo animal combatants.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.904
After we use him to
stop Mindskull's weapon,

08:25.906 --> 08:28.707
we will remove his life crystal

08:28.709 --> 08:32.143
just as we do with all
Neo animals.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.650
Scientist: Stop! We still
don't know what...

09:11.652 --> 09:13.952
What we're dealing with!

09:13.954 --> 09:15.587
Senator orders.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.722
This is my command now.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.991
Scientist: No! There's
an unknown power inside.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.827
You can't just break in!

09:22.829 --> 09:24.229
Oh...

09:59.799 --> 10:01.099
All right, beast!

10:01.101 --> 10:04.102
Now get your paw up on
that hand scanner.

10:13.145 --> 10:14.980
Ah!

10:16.650 --> 10:19.217
You heard the man, now move!

10:45.077 --> 10:46.711
Impossible.

10:54.253 --> 10:56.655
What? What's this?

10:58.090 --> 11:01.793
<i>No. No... Nac!</i>

11:05.164 --> 11:08.033
Okay now, move in.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.105
Dr. Mindskull <i>I thought
he was put away for good.</i>

11:14.107 --> 11:16.274
They're smarter than
I thought they'd be.

11:31.257 --> 11:33.091
Is that the power source?

11:33.093 --> 11:35.927
I want it shut off!

11:35.929 --> 11:39.698
Ahh, no. No... think!

11:55.715 --> 11:58.450
General. It's protected
by the casing.

11:58.452 --> 12:01.352
General short:
You. Open that.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.951
Cut it down.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.555
Dr. Mindskull:

13:10.557 --> 13:14.225
I know you just went out...

13:14.227 --> 13:16.194
But you must go out again.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.402
Wake up, you stupid monster!

13:40.821 --> 13:43.955
General short:
<i>He's free! Constrain him!</i>

13:43.957 --> 13:46.057
Trooper:

13:49.461 --> 13:51.262
general short:
Whoa!

13:57.336 --> 13:59.504
Yes. Good. Good!

14:00.472 --> 14:01.940
Heyah!

14:05.477 --> 14:07.445
No! Don't shoot that!

14:08.514 --> 14:09.848
Nac:
Arh!

14:24.930 --> 14:27.198
No! My work!

14:35.941 --> 14:37.876
Pbbt!

15:03.202 --> 15:04.969
Agh!

15:56.655 --> 15:59.524
General short:
Start the engines!

16:36.428 --> 16:37.762
Kill.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.423
Uh, we missed.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.326
That ship's over fifty
years old!

17:08.328 --> 17:10.261
Charge another shot!

17:28.313 --> 17:30.281
Charge at thirty percent.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.554
<i>Sixty percent.</i>

17:55.774 --> 17:57.175
Argh!

18:01.113 --> 18:02.480
Grrr!

18:16.562 --> 18:18.463
Fire!

18:22.801 --> 18:24.168
Nac:

18:42.588 --> 18:45.423
Trooper: <i>General, the
aircraft is on a path</i>

18:45.425 --> 18:47.258
toward zero point of
the toxic lands.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.559
That's not enough!

18:48.561 --> 18:50.595
I want the next one aimed right
at his head!

18:58.237 --> 18:59.337
It's empty.

19:18.457 --> 19:19.690
Get him!

19:25.231 --> 19:27.298
Oh, no you don't.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.400
Nac:

19:33.872 --> 19:35.640
You're mine.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.810
No wait!

19:44.683 --> 19:45.917
Argh!

20:06.638 --> 20:08.506
Nac:

21:03.662 --> 21:05.663
Voice on TV:
<i>And one and two and three...</i>

21:05.665 --> 21:07.765
The senator:
<i>A fatal mistake has occurred.</i>

21:07.767 --> 21:09.634
Scientist:
<i>They may look innocent</i>

21:09.636 --> 21:11.569
<i>but they are very, very
dangerous.</i>

21:11.571 --> 21:14.372
Female reporter: <i>The lion-bred
Nac has crashed down</i>

21:14.374 --> 21:16.974
<i>in the northwest region
of the toxic lands.</i>

21:16.976 --> 21:21.379
Scientist: <i>Fully possessing
the human brain.</i>

21:21.381 --> 21:24.048
Ugh! Start packing this up.

21:26.018 --> 21:27.051
<i>Hey!</i>

21:30.355 --> 21:33.791
We got a lion man to kill.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.974
Agh...

24:21.159 --> 24:22.560
huh?

24:24.796 --> 24:26.564
Hmm?

24:29.835 --> 24:30.835
Ech.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.540
Hmm?

24:42.514 --> 24:45.583
Huh? A working life crystal?

24:47.619 --> 24:48.786
Come here.

24:50.188 --> 24:52.690
Huh? Agh.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.159
Yeah!

25:09.975 --> 25:11.709
Hah yeah.

25:17.082 --> 25:19.683
Yeah...

25:20.919 --> 25:22.720
Male voice:
<i>Hello, Goki.</i>

25:22.722 --> 25:25.656
Mindskull? Is that you?

25:27.292 --> 25:30.127
I've been waiting for you.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.250
Female reporter:
<i>A horrific disaster...</i>

25:53.252 --> 25:56.720
<i>But with an
interesting discovery.</i>

25:56.722 --> 25:58.289
Hey. Wait! Wait!

25:58.291 --> 26:00.858
You're not supposed to be here!

26:00.860 --> 26:03.260
Female reporter:
<i>Vegetation.</i>

26:03.262 --> 26:07.998
Senator, this weapon seems more
helpful than harmful.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.337
With this new weapon,
Mindskull can control

26:13.339 --> 26:15.239
what parts of this planet
are habitable

26:15.241 --> 26:17.575
and uninhabitable.

26:17.577 --> 26:19.977
Therefore, create a new world

26:19.979 --> 26:23.213
where you will never see another
sunrise again.

29:01.172 --> 29:03.207
Go check it out.

29:43.248 --> 29:44.815
Huh?

29:51.322 --> 29:53.891
Huh? What the?

30:06.070 --> 30:08.005
Hunter:
<i>Did you fix it?</i>

30:10.175 --> 30:11.041
Agh!

30:11.043 --> 30:12.242
Whoa!

30:46.211 --> 30:48.078
Goki:

31:01.960 --> 31:03.093
Oh!

32:01.252 --> 32:03.186
Come on.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.466
Ah!

32:16.468 --> 32:19.002
Nac:

33:45.623 --> 33:47.124
Goki:
Eh.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.405
Huh?

35:25.623 --> 35:27.357
Is that the girl?

35:28.559 --> 35:30.727
Yes. Yes, Mindskull.

35:32.196 --> 35:35.198
Excellent. Send her up.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.390
Yes, come... good.

36:03.461 --> 36:06.229
What have they done to you?

36:23.781 --> 36:26.283
You've been good, Goki.

36:28.853 --> 36:34.524
You told Goki, lion man be dead,
but lion man alive.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.393
Alive!

36:37.962 --> 36:39.829
Eighteen hours in toxic lands?

36:39.831 --> 36:41.665
He should be dead.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.800
Ahhh! Oh, oh.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.569
With his senses,

36:45.571 --> 36:48.505
he'll lead them right to me.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.619
I need more time.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.454
I must kill him now!

37:25.343 --> 37:26.810
Huh?

37:36.520 --> 37:38.321
Hmm.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.925
Yes!

38:25.636 --> 38:27.904
Dr. Mindskull:
Take this.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.445
Ugh!

38:56.735 --> 38:58.401
What's happening?

39:09.613 --> 39:10.780
What?

39:22.793 --> 39:26.096
The time is now.

39:41.078 --> 39:45.815
Dr. Mindskull:
<i>Nac, Nac, Nac, you are too late!</i>

39:45.817 --> 39:48.451
<i>I now possess the power...</i>

39:48.453 --> 39:50.420
<i>Of the planet itself!</i>

39:53.524 --> 39:55.158
If you still want to live

39:55.160 --> 39:59.529
you should get as far away from
here as you can.

42:45.596 --> 42:48.131
Oh, come on!

42:48.133 --> 42:49.933
I know you're ready!

43:19.897 --> 43:21.864
Yes.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.049
Huh? What?

43:41.952 --> 43:42.952
<i>Nac!</i>

44:00.271 --> 44:02.972
You smell your blood in her.

44:02.974 --> 44:05.174
But you are mistaken.

44:05.176 --> 44:08.311
It is my blood you're
smelling... brother.

44:11.049 --> 44:12.281
Argh!

44:17.087 --> 44:21.658
The Dargon's mind tricks won't
work on me, brother.

44:21.660 --> 44:23.960
Agh!

44:23.962 --> 44:26.796
You think you're so strong...

44:26.798 --> 44:30.299
You wouldn't even last a couple
of hours

44:30.301 --> 44:33.102
without your life crystal.

44:33.104 --> 44:35.071
I should have known
our connection

44:35.073 --> 44:38.107
would draw you to her.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.743
She is not like you, Nac.

44:40.745 --> 44:45.014
She does not understand freedom
nor does she need it.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.450
It is from the
planet's core where she came

44:47.452 --> 44:50.053
and the power of the core
she brings.

44:50.055 --> 44:54.390
And under my control I will
create a new world...

44:54.392 --> 44:56.793
For my power to grow!

45:03.767 --> 45:04.834
Ha ha.

45:08.172 --> 45:12.375
Nova has begun.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.310
Ah...!

46:41.231 --> 46:45.001
Welcome!

47:07.825 --> 47:10.993
Dr. Mindskull:

47:15.299 --> 47:16.933
Ugh!

47:33.951 --> 47:35.084
Whoa!

47:38.255 --> 47:40.022
Senator, it...

47:40.024 --> 47:41.958
It's Mindskull.

47:41.960 --> 47:45.995
<i>He's... he's gonna kill us all.</i>

47:54.371 --> 47:56.339
Arm the red bomb.

48:04.014 --> 48:10.019
Pathetic humans.

49:12.450 --> 49:15.017
Ahh!

49:59.663 --> 50:01.497
Hmm.

50:04.601 --> 50:08.471
It seems there is no way to
defeat Mindskull at this state.

50:08.473 --> 50:12.408
It looks like the end of the
world as we know it.

50:15.579 --> 50:17.480
Hey! What's that?

50:21.385 --> 50:25.388
Camera man: <i>It looks like that...
Like that crazy Nac!</i>

50:28.725 --> 50:31.360
We almost are there.

50:33.563 --> 50:36.198
Get ready lion man.

51:01.324 --> 51:03.159
Agh!

52:40.390 --> 52:42.158
Ah!

53:25.936 --> 53:28.837
Don't you see?

53:28.839 --> 53:32.808
I am the new world.

53:37.480 --> 53:40.416
Don't let that Neo animal join
with Mindskull.

53:40.418 --> 53:42.384
He will only get stronger.

54:40.377 --> 54:42.645
What? He's not...

54:42.647 --> 54:44.346
No. No, wait!

54:44.348 --> 54:45.781
Don't shoot the Nac!
