WEBVTT

00:06.667 --> 00:10.292
We are the Ben Dover girls!

00:10.459 --> 00:13.125
Madde, tell us what's going on.

00:13.292 --> 00:15.792
We're going to fake a timeigration.

00:15.959 --> 00:21.959
Okay, so we're going out to sea.
Madde will swim to the Opera house,

00:22.083 --> 00:25.125
and people will think
she's a Stone Age woman.

00:25.292 --> 00:29.209
Next, I'll go to Joe & the Juice and
order a smoothie in Stone Ageish.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.834
Isn't that risky?
What if the Coast Guard shows up?

00:31.999 --> 00:34.042
You saw what the Frienemies girls did.

00:34.209 --> 00:37.417
We have to go all in if we
want to win the cover name contest.

00:37.584 --> 00:40.959
- It's going to be awesome!
- Yeah, fucking awesome!

00:43.334 --> 00:46.000
Wait! I have something.

00:46.167 --> 00:50.542
- Fuck! Did you steal that from dad?
- Yes, I did!

00:50.709 --> 00:52.792
Madde!

01:11.459 --> 01:13.542
Ben Dover!

01:14.292 --> 01:18.834
Bros! Bros! Bros!

01:20.792 --> 01:25.417
Okay, Madde! This is it! Do it!

01:25.584 --> 01:27.209
Jump right in!

01:27.375 --> 01:31.626
And we're rolling in ten, nine, eight...

01:31.792 --> 01:34.834
seven, six, five, four...

01:34.999 --> 01:38.042
three, two, one...

01:40.584 --> 01:42.542
Shit!

01:42.709 --> 01:44.459
Is it cold? Madde?

01:44.626 --> 01:47.542
The current's really strong!

01:47.709 --> 01:50.292
- I'm cramping up!
- Take my hand!

01:52.751 --> 01:55.709
You guys are so fucking gullible.

01:55.876 --> 01:57.334
- Typical.
- Every time.

01:57.501 --> 02:00.751
Start the engine.
You have to film me walking ashore.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.792
This is going to be awesome.

02:07.209 --> 02:08.751
What the hell was that?

02:08.918 --> 02:11.334
- Shit!
- What the hell was that?

02:11.501 --> 02:13.250
Madde! Where's Madde?

02:13.417 --> 02:17.250
- Where the fuck is she?
- I don't know!

02:29.501 --> 02:31.792
Madde?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.042
- Madde!
- Answer us!

02:39.209 --> 02:42.501
- She's drowning!
- Call an ambulance!

02:46.417 --> 02:48.542
No, Ingrid!

03:01.751 --> 03:03.792
Why did you throw out
my hanging fish?

03:03.959 --> 03:08.042
Why do you think?
It smells like shit!

03:55.167 --> 03:57.584
ODIN LIVES

04:08.667 --> 04:12.042
THE ANSWER LIES IN JESUS

04:49.459 --> 04:53.042
The victim was found
this morning by a hiker.

04:53.209 --> 04:57.125
He's probably been here for a while
before he was found.

05:02.292 --> 05:05.751
Yeah, that's definitely our man.
Navn Ukjent.

05:13.083 --> 05:15.125
- Are you okay?
- What?

05:15.292 --> 05:18.209
Emotional reactions are normal
the first time at a crime scene.

05:18.375 --> 05:21.834
It's fine. Have you found the spear?

05:21.999 --> 05:23.542
The spear?

05:24.667 --> 05:26.459
Yes! Or...

05:28.375 --> 05:32.209
I think we can conclude
that this man was shot, Alfhildr.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.584
Yes, we can.

05:34.751 --> 05:39.626
But that's about all we know.
The bullets went straight through.

05:39.792 --> 05:43.334
If we can't find the location
of the shooting, we've got nothing.

05:43.501 --> 05:45.375
He wasn't shot here?

05:45.542 --> 05:48.626
He's got bruises
on his knees and elbows.

05:48.792 --> 05:52.918
He seems to have crawled
quite a distance after being shot.

05:53.751 --> 05:58.375
We have to find the site of the murder
by nightfall. It's going to rain again.

05:58.542 --> 06:03.918
If we're going by Forensics' theory,
we need to search this entire area.

06:04.834 --> 06:07.042
How the hell are we going to do that?

06:12.042 --> 06:13.709
Yes?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.792
OK...

06:21.959 --> 06:26.709
Where? OK, I'll be right there.

06:30.834 --> 06:35.292
You'll have to organize
the search on your own, Alfhildr.

06:35.459 --> 06:38.209
- Me?
- Ingrid's been in an accident at sea.

06:38.375 --> 06:41.292
- OK? Is it serious?
- They don't know yet.

07:36.250 --> 07:40.417
VALENTIN PETER SCHWEIGAARD, B. 1863
D.D.A. 8 YEARS OLD

07:47.167 --> 07:49.792
NORWAY FOR NOWADAY PEOPLE

08:10.959 --> 08:13.542
Good day. What is this about?

08:54.959 --> 08:56.375
How's she doing?

08:56.542 --> 09:00.667
Good, considering the circumstances.
That is my impression.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.667
But she has been placed in solitary.

09:03.834 --> 09:05.209
What were they up to?

09:05.375 --> 09:10.042
Apparently, they were feigning
a timeigration as a graduation stunt.

09:10.209 --> 09:12.792
Marie telephoned
to notify me of the incident,

09:12.959 --> 09:17.000
She is at a conference
in Central Europe.

09:17.167 --> 09:21.000
There is, however,
a delicate topic I need to mention...

09:21.167 --> 09:23.751
You see, there has...

09:23.918 --> 09:26.834
Okay? Yes.

09:26.999 --> 09:33.876
You have to call for a search crew
and ask for a thorough search.

09:34.000 --> 09:39.542
Remember to request a dog.
I know. I have to go. Bye.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.876
- You were saying?
The situation is this:

09:42.000 --> 09:48.209
The medical personnel found traces of
intoxicating fluids in the girls' blood.

09:49.751 --> 09:53.167
OK... So they were drunk?

09:53.334 --> 09:56.751
Far worse. It was temproxate.

09:58.167 --> 10:04.501
Can you even fathom how those
sweeties were exposed to such devilry?

10:04.667 --> 10:08.792
- Temproxate? Are you sure?
- Can you believe it?

10:09.918 --> 10:13.250
No, I don't understand how...

10:15.459 --> 10:17.792
Is this a police matter now?

10:17.959 --> 10:21.167
No,
I'm one of the girls' father. Ingrid.

10:21.334 --> 10:24.167
- Right.
- How long will she be quarantined?

10:24.334 --> 10:30.167
We always run tests when there's been
unprotected contact with new arrivals.

10:30.334 --> 10:33.083
I've been in that tent myself.

10:33.250 --> 10:35.459
It usually turns out just fine.

10:35.626 --> 10:37.209
Hi.

10:38.250 --> 10:40.250
Oh, my. This...

10:40.834 --> 10:42.876
Good day.

10:44.584 --> 10:46.501
- Good day.
- Good day.

10:49.167 --> 10:52.125
- Any news on Madeleine?
- I'm sorry, no.

10:52.292 --> 10:53.959
What do the girls say about this drug?

10:54.083 --> 10:56.626
That they don't know where it came from.

10:59.999 --> 11:04.959
Are we not going to address
the elephant in the room?

11:05.083 --> 11:06.542
No?

11:07.584 --> 11:10.375
What do you mean by "elephant"?

11:11.999 --> 11:16.125
- Are you referring to me?
- Excuse me for speaking bluntly.

11:16.292 --> 11:19.000
But this is a beforeigner drug
we're talking about.

11:19.167 --> 11:22.292
And as far as I can tell,
there's only one beforeigner here.

11:22.459 --> 11:25.751
Are you implying that my background
is related to this?

11:28.334 --> 11:29.667
Yeah...

11:29.834 --> 11:33.292
You cannot let your wife
speak to me in this manner, Axel.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.459
We're on the PTA together.

11:35.626 --> 11:41.792
Even in politically correct times people
are able to put two and two together.

11:41.959 --> 11:46.125
What timesist nonsense!

11:46.292 --> 11:49.542
You should be ashamed, all of you!

12:14.999 --> 12:20.083
Forgive me for
losing my temper in there.

12:20.250 --> 12:23.209
- That happens.
- Not to me.

12:26.250 --> 12:29.584
I suppose it was too difficult for me

12:29.751 --> 12:32.000
to return to this place.

12:34.584 --> 12:36.918
Can you tell me what happened here?

12:39.125 --> 12:41.250
Marie hasn't told you?

12:46.125 --> 12:50.459
I lost my son in a storm
when I arrived in this time.

12:55.834 --> 12:59.083
Between Blekøen and Hovedøen.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.792
I'm sorry for your loss.

13:13.501 --> 13:14.999
Thank you for your concern.

13:28.999 --> 13:32.334
All crews are busy
with the landslide in Sørum.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.083
You can have them tomorrow.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.709
This is important!
We have to send someone!

13:36.876 --> 13:40.334
Don't look at me!
It's not my fault we're under-staffed!

13:40.501 --> 13:42.918
Fine. But it's going to rain tonight.

13:43.042 --> 13:46.083
You, me and Jørn have to go up there
and take care of this now.

13:46.250 --> 13:50.167
Scrutinizing one square kilometer
in one afternoon? You can't be serious.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.542
Are you not listening?

13:52.709 --> 13:58.542
I found blood here, which means
the actual area is only this big.

13:58.709 --> 14:03.250
The blood you found might as well come
from an animal as from the victim.

14:03.417 --> 14:07.083
Hello! I know what
human blood tastes like.

14:08.751 --> 14:11.501
You tasted the victim's blood?

14:11.667 --> 14:15.501
Well... That's not really
standard procedure...

14:15.667 --> 14:19.292
With these wise words in mind,
this meeting's adjourned.

14:19.459 --> 14:20.959
Sit down!

14:21.083 --> 14:24.167
I'm in charge of this case.
I want us to do the search now.

14:24.334 --> 14:28.584
I don't take orders from someone who
eats blood and stuffs moss in her pants!

14:28.751 --> 14:30.375
- Please!
- What did you say?

14:30.542 --> 14:35.042
We're not that many women here.
I figured out where that lump came from.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.999
I use Libresse with wings.
But you wouldn't know about that.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.250
Your snatch dried up 20 years ago.

14:54.584 --> 14:56.042
Alfhildr...

14:58.042 --> 15:03.375
If you want your subordinates to work
extra, you need to be more flexible.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.417
Thanks for the input.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.209
Ingrid? Ingrid!

15:21.375 --> 15:24.292
- Madde?
- Can I talk to you?

15:26.083 --> 15:30.459
- Ingrid!
- Madde, no! We're quarantined!

15:30.626 --> 15:35.667
- Don't come in here!
- Ingrid! I have to talk to someone!

15:35.834 --> 15:38.709
- What have they done to me?
- Nothing. We were in an accident.

15:38.876 --> 15:42.626
No, there's more than that!

15:42.792 --> 15:46.125
- I'm seeing things, Ingrid!
- What kind of things?

15:46.292 --> 15:49.999
I don't know! I can't explain it, but...

15:50.125 --> 15:53.000
- They're lying!
- Madde, who's lying?

15:53.167 --> 15:58.000
They say the discoloration of my teeth
is from the electricity in the water.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.501
But they're rotten! Look!

16:02.167 --> 16:05.292
- Madde, I don't understand.
- Let me in.

16:05.459 --> 16:09.999
Madde, no! Please, don't do it!
Madde, no! Don't come in here!

16:10.125 --> 16:13.000
- No!
- Madde!

16:13.167 --> 16:15.709
- Madde!
- Ingrid!

16:15.876 --> 16:19.626
They're lying! No! Ingrid!

16:19.792 --> 16:24.959
They're lying! Ingrid!

16:26.167 --> 16:28.334
Yes.

16:28.501 --> 16:31.751
Yes, but I don't know what to do!

16:31.918 --> 16:34.876
- Wenche said...
- Don't let Wenche sideline you.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.584
She always chooses the easy way out.

16:37.751 --> 16:41.417
All of the evidence
could be compromised.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.501
I'm sure you'll find a solution,
Alfhildr.

16:44.667 --> 16:46.584
I've got good news.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.751
Throw the knatt ball!

17:01.792 --> 17:03.250
Knatt!

17:09.417 --> 17:12.125
- Knatt foul!
- What are you talking about?

17:12.292 --> 17:14.999
You were standing on the line
when you hit it.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.334
No fucking way!

17:17.501 --> 17:19.918
Stop. A surveillance car's coming.

17:20.042 --> 17:22.709
So? We didn't do anything.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.501
Are you kidding?
My backpack's full of shrooms!

17:26.667 --> 17:29.959
Throw the shrooms in the bushes, then!

17:36.042 --> 17:39.501
Relax, guys! It's just my friend.

17:41.209 --> 17:46.083
Hey, shieldmaiden!
You shouldn't pull up in that thing.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.584
My boys almost had a heart attack.

17:48.751 --> 17:53.083
Sorry. But I need your help
with some cop stuff.

17:53.250 --> 17:54.584
Okay?

17:54.751 --> 17:58.709
I have to find the location
of a shooting before nightfall.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.709
Tonight's no good.

18:01.876 --> 18:05.459
It's skáld night at Nivlhel,
and Skjalg is going on stage.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.584
- When's he going on?
- Around midnight.

18:08.751 --> 18:11.250
We can get it done before that.

18:12.125 --> 18:16.042
I'll leave my card in the bar
if you can take care of this.

18:17.417 --> 18:22.125
What do you say, guys?
Anyone want free mead?

18:25.501 --> 18:27.626
- Of course!
- Of course!

18:33.667 --> 18:37.918
I hope you have a lot of money
on that card, Enginnsdottir.

18:38.042 --> 18:41.918
This bloodhound never fails!

18:43.167 --> 18:48.083
If you feed him more shrooms,
he won't be able to find his own tail!

18:48.250 --> 18:52.792
What? You're feeding him shrooms?
You do know this is a police car?

18:52.959 --> 18:56.417
So?
Is it illegal for dogs to eat shrooms?

18:59.751 --> 19:01.626
Quit it!

19:01.792 --> 19:04.417
Don't be such a Goody Two-Shoes.

19:04.584 --> 19:08.209
If we're going to be cops,
let us be cops!

19:10.167 --> 19:12.542
Don't go to sleep tonight, robbers!

19:12.709 --> 19:17.459
Here come detective Motherless
and her squires!

19:17.626 --> 19:24.626
We'll grab the city by the balls
and bring evil to its knees!

19:40.042 --> 19:42.000
Come here.

19:46.417 --> 19:48.292
Do you know
what's happening with Madeleine?

19:48.459 --> 19:50.292
No.

19:50.459 --> 19:54.334
But... She's not in her right mind,
that's for sure.

19:58.999 --> 20:04.709
Your father and I have to address
the issue with the temproxate.

20:06.542 --> 20:10.792
How could consider
trying something like that?

20:10.959 --> 20:13.918
I don't know.
It was stupid.

20:14.042 --> 20:15.792
Indeed.

20:18.501 --> 20:21.292
Who procured the stimulant?

20:23.792 --> 20:25.459
Can't remember.

20:26.667 --> 20:30.959
- I'm just so tired.
- Of course.

20:31.083 --> 20:35.167
We'll continue this conversation
when you're feeling better.

20:46.792 --> 20:51.083
Wll. I'm glad you're okay.

20:51.250 --> 20:55.125
Let's not say goodbye on the porch
after a day like this.

20:55.292 --> 20:58.709
Come on in for a Vermouth. I insist.

21:14.209 --> 21:16.959
It'll start raining in two hours.

21:17.083 --> 21:21.792
The search perimeter runs
from these masts to the hill over there.

21:21.959 --> 21:24.542
Listen to Nerd-hildr.
"Search perimeters"!

21:24.709 --> 21:29.959
Get it together!
My honor as an officer's at stake!

21:30.083 --> 21:32.167
Okay. What are we looking for?

21:32.334 --> 21:36.876
Large amounts of blood,
bullets, shell casings.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.209
Relax, ladies.

21:39.375 --> 21:43.459
Just give me the leaf,
and Ginsberg will sort the rest.

21:43.626 --> 21:48.042
Hey, Ginsberg...
Make daddy proud!

21:51.751 --> 21:56.834
Not that way! Ginsberg! Ginsberg!

21:58.918 --> 22:03.334
Maybe the two-legged ones
should help out, just in case?

22:23.584 --> 22:26.709
Can you tell me where
you got the temproxate?

22:26.876 --> 22:30.834
Why do you ask questions
you already know the answer to?

22:30.999 --> 22:34.000
- How could you be so stupid?
- It wasn't me! It was Madeleine!

22:34.167 --> 22:36.876
- Stealing something like that!
I begged her not to do it!

22:45.834 --> 22:48.709
You could have told me.

22:48.876 --> 22:51.542
- I could have.
- Yeah, you could have.

22:51.709 --> 22:54.709
Why do you have those bottles anyway?

22:54.876 --> 22:57.042
They're from a drug bust.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.292
Yeah, right.
I wasn't born yesterday.

23:00.459 --> 23:03.834
Do you mind plastic?

23:03.999 --> 23:09.292
My silver plated cocktail sticks were
ruined in the dishwashing tumbler.

23:10.626 --> 23:12.417
- Good night.
- Good night.

23:12.584 --> 23:14.751
- Sleep well, Ingrid.
- Good night.

23:15.999 --> 23:21.000
Would you like to know what elevates
a Vermouth to perfection?

23:21.167 --> 23:23.375
A filled pipe.

23:25.042 --> 23:29.042
I'm not a pipe-smoking kind of guy.

23:29.209 --> 23:31.542
You won't know until you've tried.

23:35.999 --> 23:38.042
Now draw.

23:38.209 --> 23:41.667
- Draw in. Come on.
- There we go.

23:42.999 --> 23:45.459
There you have it.

23:45.626 --> 23:47.417
I can feel it!

23:48.667 --> 23:51.417
And then... The Vermouth.

23:55.334 --> 23:58.125
Nice. So this is where
you do your stargazing?

23:58.292 --> 24:02.918
Yes. At least they're how I remember
them from the old days.

24:04.417 --> 24:06.834
Most other things are in flux.

24:12.292 --> 24:16.083
- What was your son's name?
- Valentin.

24:18.250 --> 24:22.501
He was delightful.
Quite the rapscallion.

24:24.584 --> 24:28.334
And now he's at
The Cemetary of Our Savior.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.834
Do you visit his grave a lot?

24:29.999 --> 24:33.792
I was there
when they telephoned about Ingrid.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.999
His resting place
had been vandalized by timesists.

24:38.792 --> 24:42.626
- That's fucked up.
- You can say that.

24:43.918 --> 24:46.375
It's not the first time, unfortunately.

24:46.542 --> 24:50.083
I'll talk to security.
This needs to stop.

24:51.667 --> 24:55.501
- Would you do me that favor?
- Sure.

24:55.667 --> 25:00.292
It seems you're a greater man
than what I first presumed, Haaland.

25:00.459 --> 25:02.584
I wouldn't go that far.

25:02.751 --> 25:07.709
Give it a week, and you'll think
I'm an annoying arsehole again.

25:07.876 --> 25:11.918
That is a highly plausible scenario.

25:17.375 --> 25:23.292
It can't be easy for them.
I suppose we can spare an apple or two.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.209
Fuck. You guys
haven't found anything either?

25:45.375 --> 25:48.792
No. My boy's just having a bad day.

25:49.999 --> 25:52.959
Looks like we have to pay
for our own mead tonight.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.792
The old Sami's found something.

26:30.667 --> 26:35.709
What are you waiting for, shieldmaiden?
Call the cops, so we can get to Nivlhel!

26:56.709 --> 27:01.999
To detective Motherless
and her endless wealth!

27:02.125 --> 27:06.042
Hear, hear! May this well never run dry!

27:06.209 --> 27:10.918
It won't last long,
the way you're throwing it back.

27:11.042 --> 27:14.959
It's time for the first skáld of
the evening here at the Nivler.

27:15.083 --> 27:21.000
The man who made the earls cry
with his lay of deeds:

27:21.167 --> 27:23.709
Skjalg Egilsson!

27:30.334 --> 27:34.209
The Lay of the King!
The Lay of the King!

27:34.375 --> 27:38.751
How's it going with that other thing?
You know...

27:38.918 --> 27:42.626
I finally manned up
and started the treatment.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.709
Is it working?

27:44.876 --> 27:48.792
Like a sword through butter.
Come on, Skjalg!

27:48.959 --> 27:52.999
It's nice that you all have a favorite.

27:53.125 --> 27:55.292
But tonight,
I'd like to try something new.

27:55.459 --> 27:58.918
It's a free form verse,
and it's called...

28:00.751 --> 28:04.709
- "The Maze."
- The Lay of the King!

28:04.876 --> 28:07.083
"The Maze."

28:07.876 --> 28:14.125
The salt in tears is the same
as the salt in the ocean

28:17.959 --> 28:24.542
The sand in the hourglass,
like the longing in my songs

28:25.501 --> 28:31.626
The Lay of the King!
The Lay of the King!

28:32.918 --> 28:36.876
Okay! I take the hint!

28:40.459 --> 28:42.167
I take the hint!

28:43.083 --> 28:45.375
The Lay of the King!

29:01.501 --> 29:05.959
Yes, we're having a meeting later.

29:06.083 --> 29:09.292
Look, it's that incessant journalist...

29:10.292 --> 29:13.959
I have a few questions in regards to
the body that was found in the woods.

29:14.083 --> 29:19.501
We see that Haaland and Enginnsdottir
are leading this investigation as well.

29:19.667 --> 29:23.751
So there's a connection
to the murder at Tjuvholmen?

29:23.918 --> 29:25.250
I can't comment on that.

29:25.417 --> 29:28.584
I was referred to
Enginnsdottir and Haaland.

29:28.751 --> 29:30.167
They won't answer my inquiries.

29:30.334 --> 29:33.999
We have
no further comments at this time.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.167
We need an update
on the murder in the forest immediately.

29:41.334 --> 29:44.000
- Is it linked to the Tjuvholmen case?
- I think so.

29:44.167 --> 29:49.000
I heard Enginnsdottir found the crime
scene, but I've yet to receive a report.

29:49.167 --> 29:52.042
It seems she's indisposed.

29:52.209 --> 29:54.375
- Indisposed?
- I've tried to reach her all day.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.999
I emailed and called her
about 40 times.

29:57.125 --> 30:00.292
I'm sure there's a natural explanation.

30:00.459 --> 30:02.918
I don't know what's natural to her.

30:03.042 --> 30:05.334
She brags about
tasting the victim's blood.

30:05.501 --> 30:09.459
- What are you saying?
- We'll talk about this later, Grete.

30:09.626 --> 30:11.709
Get a hold of Enginnsdottir!

30:11.876 --> 30:15.834
I want to know
where this case stands, right now.

30:16.834 --> 30:20.375
The person you're calling
is unavailable...

30:34.918 --> 30:36.751
Alfhildr?

30:40.501 --> 30:44.000
Are you Ravvga's messenger?

30:44.167 --> 30:49.876
No, I'm from the Oslo police.
I'm Alfhildr's colleague...

30:50.000 --> 30:51.459
Alfhildr?

31:03.584 --> 31:05.501
Alfhildr!

31:15.167 --> 31:18.501
I'm sorry.
I didn't hear my alarm clock.

31:19.501 --> 31:21.959
Rough night?

31:23.459 --> 31:27.667
I hosted a small social gathering
with the search crew.

31:27.834 --> 31:34.375
Congrats on your findings.
How's the report coming along?

31:34.542 --> 31:37.292
Skit'r! I forgot.

31:37.459 --> 31:44.083
The Chief is about to lose it.
Get dressed. I'll help you write it.

31:49.584 --> 31:52.375
Do you have anything for headaches?

31:52.542 --> 31:54.709
In my jacket.

32:13.292 --> 32:19.000
YOU FAILED TO ATTEND
YOUR DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT

32:23.167 --> 32:25.918
Alfhildr! Are you coming?

32:26.042 --> 32:28.999
Since our own
search crew was unavailable,

32:29.125 --> 32:32.834
Alfhildr chose
to utilize civilian assistance.

32:32.999 --> 32:35.501
She contacted a Norse group of people

32:35.667 --> 32:41.083
specializing in traditional
path-finding techniques.

32:41.250 --> 32:46.542
We found the crime scene using
a bloodhound trained by this group,

32:46.709 --> 32:51.709
and an old Sami
with special path-finding skills.

32:54.834 --> 32:57.751
I'll admit I was worried.

32:57.918 --> 33:00.167
But this looks excellent.

33:02.584 --> 33:04.501
Good work, Harald.

33:05.876 --> 33:08.834
We have to tell the media
about the path-finding.

33:08.999 --> 33:12.751
That's the kind of innovation
the Minister wants.

33:12.918 --> 33:17.334
Forensics just sent us an email
about the murder weapon.

33:18.709 --> 33:23.751
"Bullet fragments suggest Name
was shot by a military drone."

33:23.918 --> 33:25.751
Exigo Y.

33:25.918 --> 33:28.292
Who would kill a Stone Age guy
with a drone?

33:28.459 --> 33:32.876
- What was the name of the weapon again?
- Exigo Y.

33:43.125 --> 33:46.667
Do you know the incident
in Marseilles last year?

33:46.834 --> 33:50.459
A newly arrived beforeigner
committed mass murder upon arrival.

33:50.626 --> 33:52.584
Yes.

33:52.751 --> 33:55.209
Obviously, it gave rise to concern.

33:55.375 --> 33:59.876
So management met
to discuss potential measures

34:00.000 --> 34:02.250
in the event of similar scenarios.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.751
What does this
have to do with the drone?

34:04.918 --> 34:09.626
Armed drones protecting civilians
was one of the pilot projects.

34:09.792 --> 34:13.999
A joint operation between
the armed forces and the harbor police.

34:14.125 --> 34:18.209
And you believe the weapon used
in Nordmarka is linked to this?

34:18.375 --> 34:20.000
I'm more or less certain.

34:22.125 --> 34:25.083
It was shut down
after a security breach.

34:25.250 --> 34:28.083
A drone was stolen.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.375
The model was Exigo Y.

34:35.209 --> 34:36.709
Was anyone caught?

34:36.876 --> 34:39.876
The military guys said

34:40.000 --> 34:43.999
it could be tied to those 1800s idiots
who attack technology.

34:44.125 --> 34:46.334
The Neo-Luddites?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.459
Why wasn't anyone alerted?

34:48.626 --> 34:52.542
Those people barely know
how to unlock an iPhone.

34:52.709 --> 34:56.834
According to army experts,
this drone is so sophisticated,

34:56.999 --> 35:00.459
maybe ten people in Norway
can operate it.

35:00.626 --> 35:06.417
That army contact of yours, can you
have him send a list of names?

35:07.959 --> 35:09.792
Okay.

35:15.626 --> 35:18.626
Hi. Meet me in five.

35:20.125 --> 35:21.999
Okay. Bye.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.417
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:29.584 --> 35:33.626
So...
I spoke to the pathologist.

35:34.542 --> 35:38.751
All that talk about Norse path-finders.
It's bullshit.

35:38.918 --> 35:43.959
Alfhildr brought some shroomies there.
They stumbled across the crime scene.

35:44.083 --> 35:47.542
- Okay?
- It gets better. I have a name.

35:47.709 --> 35:49.751
- Well?
- Here.

35:51.918 --> 35:55.125
See the caption
under her profile picture?

35:55.292 --> 35:58.876
"Once a warrior, always a warrior."

36:00.042 --> 36:03.792
Could this mean Alfhildr
was a warrior too?

36:03.959 --> 36:08.709
If so, she should never have been
admitted to the Police Academy.

36:08.876 --> 36:10.584
Oh, dear.

36:27.459 --> 36:30.876
Welcome home, detective Motherless.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.459
You look a little pale.

36:33.626 --> 36:37.459
We need to get you some mead.

36:37.626 --> 36:39.667
Bartender! Mead!

36:39.834 --> 36:41.792
Coming up.

36:42.375 --> 36:44.375
By Loki's balls!

36:44.542 --> 36:48.000
No, I think you and I
have to run an errand.

37:09.626 --> 37:13.959
I can't do it. Let me out.

37:15.334 --> 37:19.459
- Just lay down with your head facing...
- I said, let me out!

37:21.501 --> 37:23.334
It's okay.

37:24.292 --> 37:28.792
Lay down. I'm going to tell you a story.

37:35.375 --> 37:39.083
Remember that day
when we came home from Biarmaland?

37:39.250 --> 37:43.626
We were lying on the hills
behind the tavern house,

37:43.792 --> 37:48.626
waiting for Stinky Finn
to finish the horse stew.

37:52.584 --> 37:55.918
Do you remember
that a skald came by?

37:56.918 --> 38:02.292
The one who chanted so beautifully
about Gudrun and the dragon slayer?

38:04.751 --> 38:09.584
You and I joined in
with our croaky voices.

38:12.501 --> 38:16.250
He said something
that I'll never forget:

38:17.834 --> 38:21.459
"We don't sing the songs."

38:21.626 --> 38:24.292
"The songs are singing us."

38:44.042 --> 38:47.292
So? What do you think?

38:47.459 --> 38:51.375
It's like having
the good, old Madde back.

38:52.501 --> 38:57.334
I'm sorry. Perhaps I should keep my lips
closed until I've seen a dentist.

38:57.501 --> 38:59.542
That's probably not a bad idea.

38:59.709 --> 39:03.999
Get some rest, and your dad
and I will get started on dinner.

39:04.125 --> 39:05.918
Thank you.

39:17.834 --> 39:19.417
What are you looking at?

39:19.584 --> 39:24.876
A list of names of people
trained to operate an Exigo Y drone.

39:31.375 --> 39:34.792
What the hell..?
Do you see who that is?

39:36.501 --> 39:43.083
Skit'r! It's that 1800s wannabe
who took our phones at the AFTT.

39:46.999 --> 39:49.667
QUARANTINE ZONE Y
NO ENTRY

40:08.709 --> 40:10.542
Hi.

40:21.792 --> 40:24.250
- Well?
- Shit! You scared me!

40:24.417 --> 40:26.709
When did you get so jumpy?

40:26.876 --> 40:29.042
This is the last time.

40:45.834 --> 40:49.000
TEMPORAL ANOMALIES CONFIRMED

42:08.000 --> 42:12.584
Our Father who art in heaven.

42:12.751 --> 42:17.667
Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.

42:17.834 --> 42:22.375
Thy will be done, in earth
as it is in heaven.
