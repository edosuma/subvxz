WEBVTT

00:02.070 --> 00:03.704
- A Pop Original.

00:04.838 --> 00:08.209
[lively trumpet music]

00:08.242 --> 00:13.381
*

00:13.414 --> 00:16.150
- Penny, hi.
Listen, I'm gonna be late.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.752
I'm just finishing
my kale smoothie.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.588
I'll be there soon.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.456
Yeah.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.724
- Hey, that's my money!

00:23.757 --> 00:25.393
I need it to eat!
- It's mine now.

00:25.426 --> 00:28.096
Get a job and stop
mooching the system.

00:30.731 --> 00:33.134
- Excuse me.

00:33.167 --> 00:36.170
May I please have a napkin?

00:39.507 --> 00:41.609
Thank you.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.344
- Yeah.
- I'm Juju Chang

00:43.377 --> 00:44.578
with "What Would You Do
In This Instance?"

00:44.612 --> 00:45.846
You just watched
that woman steal

00:45.879 --> 00:47.715
from that
poor homeless boy

00:47.748 --> 00:49.617
and shove him,
and you did nothing.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.684
Why?

00:52.853 --> 00:55.323
- [speaking gibberish]

00:55.356 --> 00:57.425
- What is that accent?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.227
- Belgium...ese.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.728
- That is clearly
a fake accent.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.430
And what's more,
it's an insult

01:02.463 --> 01:04.498
to all the wonderful
people of Belgium,

01:04.532 --> 01:07.768
just so you could cover up
your lack of moral character.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.170
- Shame.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.507
- [stammering]
I-I don't speak English.

01:13.541 --> 01:17.345
Fake news! Fake news!

01:17.378 --> 01:18.879
male announcer:
From Studio 9B

01:18.912 --> 01:20.848
in the heart
of New York City,

01:20.881 --> 01:23.851
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

01:23.884 --> 01:26.854
Tonight,
"Suddenly Susan" alum

01:26.887 --> 01:28.656
Brooke Shields!
[crowd cheers]

01:28.689 --> 01:31.325
Not a "Gossip Girl"
but a gossip mom,

01:31.359 --> 01:33.227
Kelly Rutherford!

01:33.261 --> 01:38.132
Jimmy's new
viral video series "Yass Dog."

01:38.166 --> 01:40.834
And now,
number five in the ratings

01:40.868 --> 01:42.503
but number one in our hearts,

01:42.536 --> 01:44.605
here's Jimmy!

01:44.638 --> 01:47.375
*

01:47.408 --> 01:49.510
- And the boy yelled "shame!"

01:49.543 --> 01:51.779
Like I was that evil queen
from "Game of Thrones."

01:51.812 --> 01:53.747
- What? No.
She's way younger than you.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.249
- Uh--
- Do the accent.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.617
I wanna hear it.

01:56.650 --> 01:59.153
- No.
I am not doing the accent.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.354
But it was impeccable,

02:00.388 --> 02:01.689
despite what Juju Chang says.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.158
- What you did was despicable.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.726
And I say that
having worked with Mel Gibson.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.328
- Okay, okay, my head was

02:07.361 --> 02:08.829
in the game,
you know what I mean?

02:08.862 --> 02:11.232
I was only thinking
about the show.

02:11.265 --> 02:13.434
Doesn't make me a bad person,
does it?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.502
- Uh...
- [murmurs]

02:14.535 --> 02:17.838
[tense music]

02:17.871 --> 02:19.673
- No!
- Well, you know what?

02:19.707 --> 02:22.943
Jimmy says that women
are inherently evil, so...

02:22.976 --> 02:24.478
And bad at sports.
- Mm.

02:24.512 --> 02:25.879
Anonymous tweeters
have proven

02:25.913 --> 02:27.181
that everyone
is inherently evil.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.816
- Not Staci.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.384
- Then how come
she has no friends?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.320
- My friends
are Staci's friends,

02:32.353 --> 02:34.488
and she is always
welcome to our brunch.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.290
You should come sometime.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.725
- Oh, I'd rather kill myself.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.959
- [mouths word]
- Uh, not 'cause of you.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.428
I hate brunch.
- [laughs]

02:40.461 --> 02:41.962
- Oof.
I haven't been to brunch

02:41.995 --> 02:43.831
since I married a woman.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.599
- Let's talk about the show.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.868
We have two amazing
actresses on tonight.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.603
- [gasps] Is it Kylie Jenner
and Kendall Jenner?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.805
- No, Phil.
- Is it Kaley Cuoco

02:51.839 --> 02:53.774
and Ariana Grande?
- No, Phil.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.976
- Is it Bernadette Peters
and Mandy Patinkin?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.478
- No, Phil.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.779
- It's Kelly Rutherford

02:58.812 --> 03:00.248
and Brooke Shields.

03:00.281 --> 03:01.782
- Awesome.
Yo, the kids

03:01.815 --> 03:03.551
are gonna love to meet
some famous people.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.319
- There's no children
scheduled today.

03:05.353 --> 03:06.887
Kids are very germy.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.856
- No, it's "Bring Jimmy's Kids
To Work Day."

03:08.889 --> 03:10.458
- All of them?
[scoffs]

03:10.491 --> 03:11.592
I read he has, like, 12.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.227
- 32.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.428
And 6 more due this spring.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.896
- How is that possible?

03:15.929 --> 03:17.998
- Uh, Jimmy doesn't donate
to charity.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.733
He donates his sperm

03:19.767 --> 03:22.270
to help needy women
have a celebrity baby.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.704
- Gross...
- Ugh.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.439
- But on brand.
- Yeah, every year,

03:25.473 --> 03:27.341
he invites four
of his lucky sperm kids

03:27.375 --> 03:29.710
to the studio for a picture
and to meet him.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.379
But, you know,
he's tanning all day,

03:31.412 --> 03:32.746
so I get to take care
of them.

03:32.780 --> 03:35.383
- Todd,
that's so sweet of you.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.717
- Yeah.
- Uh, Staci,

03:36.750 --> 03:38.552
Todd's a good person.

03:38.586 --> 03:40.254
Maybe you should
spend time with him,

03:40.288 --> 03:41.589
and then you could be
a good person.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.357
- Oh, my God, Phil!

03:43.391 --> 03:47.628
- Oh, there's that
bad person tone again.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.330
Don't make me call Juju.

03:50.831 --> 03:52.766
*

03:52.800 --> 03:53.934
[knocking on door]

03:53.967 --> 03:55.669
- Hi! Staci Cole!

03:55.703 --> 03:57.838
- Oh, my gosh,
you remember my name.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.907
- Yeah.
- Jimmy rarely does.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.409
- Oh, well, most celebrities

04:01.442 --> 04:02.910
can be a little
full of themselves.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.712
- [laughs]
Well, tell that to Juju Chang.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.414
Anyway, I'm just making sure
you're settled in.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.681
You have everything you need?

04:07.715 --> 04:09.683
- Aren't you nice?
Yes, thank you.

04:09.717 --> 04:10.884
- Okay.
- Yeah. [laughs]

04:10.918 --> 04:12.386
- I am nice...
- Yeah.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.521
- As a matter of fact.
- Yes.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.055
- Tell that to Juju Chang.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.557
[laughs] I'm sorry.
- Oh, listen, some people

04:16.590 --> 04:18.492
just won't like you,
no matter what.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.927
Haters always gonna hate.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.962
- Well, and fakers
always gonna fake.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.932
- [laughing]
You're hilarious.

04:24.965 --> 04:27.868
Hey, you should stay.
Hang out.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.938
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah, I, uh...

04:30.971 --> 04:34.342
I got this wine in
a little gift bag this morning.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.843
- Wow.
- Shall we be naughty?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.745
- Well, I, uh--
- Come on, Stace.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.348
- I really shouldn't--
- Don't make me drink alone.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.815
- Um...
- Okay.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.352
- Well, here we go!
I'm drinking wine

04:44.385 --> 04:46.420
with Hollywood icon
Brooke Shields.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.988
- Oh. [laughs]
Stop, please.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.858
I am just an ordinary girl,
who happens to be

04:50.891 --> 04:52.660
the granddaughter
of an Italian princess.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.062
- [gasps] I am the granddaughter
of a pig farmer.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.030
- Shut up. I love prosciutto.

04:57.064 --> 04:59.933
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
This is incredible.

04:59.967 --> 05:03.036
*

05:03.070 --> 05:05.473
- You can come in here.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.641
Todd, I have four children
for you.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.543
- All right.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.412
- They smell like paste.
- I think, actually,

05:11.445 --> 05:13.481
you got some paste
under your nose.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.815
- [sniffs] Oh.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.417
I was scrapbooking...

05:16.450 --> 05:17.818
[quietly] For Mother.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.988
- Mm.
- You can sit on this couch.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.490
- Hey, guys.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.425
How you doing,
my little Jimmies?

05:24.458 --> 05:27.428
- "Jimmies" is a racist term
for an ice cream topping.

05:27.461 --> 05:31.131
- That's America for you.
Always a little racism.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.967
Let that be a lesson!
[chuckles]

05:34.001 --> 05:36.470
See, it was worth
taking you out of school today.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.738
I'm your Uncle Todd.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.373
- You're not our real uncle.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.974
You're just a parasite
who latched onto

05:41.008 --> 05:42.710
our biological father.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.845
- Eh, let's stick
with Uncle Todd, all right?

05:44.878 --> 05:46.614
Uh, and to make this simple,

05:46.647 --> 05:48.382
I'm gonna call you Jimmy 1,

05:48.416 --> 05:50.050
you Jimmy 2, Jimmy 3,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.485
and Jimmy 4.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.853
- When do we take the photo?

05:52.886 --> 05:54.722
- Hey, that's a great
question, Jimmy 1.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.123
[laughs] I don't know.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.791
- Todd. [laughs]
- Hey.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.093
- It's so great
to see you with kids.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.729
- Yeah.
Yeah, I always wanted

06:01.762 --> 06:02.930
kids of my own, but...

06:02.963 --> 06:04.698
too focused on my career.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.133
- Yeah, it can be hard

06:06.166 --> 06:08.569
to balance the two.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.038
- So what fun stuff
do you have planned for them?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.873
- Oh, I got it all figured out.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.608
We're gonna sit here and wait.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.411
[text message tone chirps]

06:17.445 --> 06:19.447
- When I was a kid,
my parents made me

06:19.480 --> 06:22.516
sit quietly in a room
with nothing but my pet ferret.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.518
- Mm.
- I used to imagine that

06:24.552 --> 06:25.853
he was a prince,
and we would go on

06:25.886 --> 06:27.921
adventures together,
until one day

06:27.955 --> 06:30.023
my mom walked in
on me dancing

06:30.057 --> 06:32.125
with the lifeless body
of the ferret prince.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.828
- [chuckles] Moms.

06:34.862 --> 06:37.598
- The point is,
kids need activities.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.500
- Oh. [laughs]
Nah, it's okay.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.034
We're just gonna
sit here and wait.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.703
If anything happened
to Jimmy's little Jimmies,

06:42.736 --> 06:44.171
whew, I'd be in big trouble.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.206
It's like I'm their dad
for the day.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.442
- Come on.
Nothing's gonna happen.

06:48.476 --> 06:50.110
It'll be fun.
We'll do it together!

06:50.143 --> 06:53.847
- Like... two dads?

06:53.881 --> 06:56.784
- Well, like a dad and a...

06:56.817 --> 06:57.818
* Mom

06:57.851 --> 06:59.019
- Oh, I didn't know

06:59.052 --> 07:00.488
you were so traditional.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.122
All right, let's go!
[laughs]

07:02.155 --> 07:03.791
- [speaking gibberish]

07:03.824 --> 07:05.526
I am from Belgium.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.094
- [laughs] I do not know

07:07.127 --> 07:08.529
what Juju Chang was thinking.

07:08.562 --> 07:09.563
That accent...
- Right?

07:09.597 --> 07:10.931
- C'est parfait.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.934
- Thank you.
- [sighs] Oh, er...

07:13.967 --> 07:15.703
- [laughing]
- Finished.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.905
- Drinking at work.
I feel like Don Draper.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.008
- Et... voilà.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.677
- Oh, my God, they gave you
two bottles of wine

07:23.711 --> 07:25.112
at a morning show?
- Yeah.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.615
It was Kathie Lee and Hoda,
and those ladies

07:27.648 --> 07:29.049
like to get
Chardonnay'ed up.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.918
Mm.
- Wow.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.085
[gasps]
[door slams]

07:32.119 --> 07:33.654
- Hey!
- Knock-knock!

07:33.687 --> 07:35.589
- Hi!
- Kelly Rutherford!

07:35.623 --> 07:36.990
- Brooke, I saw
you were on the show,

07:37.024 --> 07:38.225
and I just had to
come say hi.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.827
"Suddenly Susan."
I mean...

07:39.860 --> 07:41.261
- Oh, Kelly Rutherford.
- [laughs]

07:41.294 --> 07:44.231
I mean, come on.
"Gossip Girl"--oh!

07:44.264 --> 07:45.699
[laughing]

07:45.733 --> 07:47.100
Um, so, come on.
Come on in and--

07:47.134 --> 07:48.736
- Okay, okay.
- Hi, Kelly.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.103
Staci Cole.
- Of course.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.672
Great to see you.
- Good to see you.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.574
- [exhales]
Another nice person.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.142
Have a drink.
- Oh, no, no, that's okay.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.177
I have my pre-interview.
[laughs]

07:57.210 --> 07:58.946
- Yes.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.649
- [clears throat]
- I heard that about you.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.283
- What?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.519
- That you can be
a bit of a goody-goody.

08:05.553 --> 08:07.821
- Oh.
Well, you know,

08:07.855 --> 08:09.823
that's true.
Um, so maybe I'll--

08:09.857 --> 08:11.559
I can just--
I'll have one glass.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.694
- Forget it.
You made your choice.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.798
[laughs] Just kidding.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.932
- [laughing] Oh, my God.
- Just kidding.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.101
[all laughing]

08:21.134 --> 08:22.603
[knocking on door]

08:22.636 --> 08:23.737
- Who is it?

08:23.771 --> 08:25.305
- It's Davis.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.307
The door is locked.
- Ah.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.943
- Well, it's locked on purpose.
- Staci, can I see you

08:29.977 --> 08:31.745
out here for a second?
I need to talk to you.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.180
It's highly unprofessional

08:33.213 --> 08:35.148
to communicate
through a door.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.884
- I'm sorry. There's a lot
of naked women in here.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.151
[whispers] He's so uncool.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.720
[all laughing]

08:39.753 --> 08:41.789
- All right. Fine.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.857
We have a small emergency.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.893
Have you seen Kelly?
I left her in

08:45.926 --> 08:47.895
her dressing room,
and she's not there anymore.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.329
- Kelly who?
[both laugh]

08:49.362 --> 08:51.031
- I am not going to engage in

08:51.064 --> 08:52.165
sarcastic banter right now.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.101
Kelly's never been through

08:54.134 --> 08:55.268
a Jimmy interview,
and I need to get her ready.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.037
Jimmy wants her familiar

08:57.070 --> 08:59.707
with the "Yass Dog" segment.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.642
- Well, yass, Davis,
go, uh,

09:01.675 --> 09:04.277
try craft service.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.345
- Okay.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.848
[all smothering laughter]

09:07.881 --> 09:09.583
- I'm sorry.
- That's classic.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.885
- He's got a pole up his--
- It's classic!

09:11.919 --> 09:15.689
- [gasps]
Oh, my God, whiskey?

09:15.723 --> 09:18.158
- Whiskey after wine,
feelin' fine.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.828
- I don't think that's a thing.
- It is now.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.730
- You know what?
I should take Kelly

09:22.763 --> 09:24.231
and get her
to her pre-interview.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.699
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.901
You can't go.
Kelly just got here.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.670
You wanna stay,
don't you, Kelly?

09:29.703 --> 09:30.971
- Well--
- I know, but, you know what?

09:31.004 --> 09:32.139
You probably
have a wardrobe thing...

09:32.172 --> 09:33.774
- Yeah.
- And we can't--

09:33.807 --> 09:35.275
- Sit your skinny ass down
and take the shot.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.579
I don't drink alone.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.715
You too, Kelly.

09:46.219 --> 09:49.289
- [clears throat]

09:49.322 --> 09:51.258
- On three.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.860
Three.

09:58.666 --> 09:59.700
[both gag and cough]

10:02.402 --> 10:09.242
*

10:11.411 --> 10:13.914
- Um, well,
these are mic packs.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.084
Um, oftentimes, people
forget that their mic is on.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.319
That's how I have
hundreds of recordings

10:19.352 --> 10:21.722
of your father
saying horrible things.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.090
- About who?

10:23.123 --> 10:26.760
- Um, everybody.
Horrible, hateful stuff.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.696
It's my retirement fund.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.130
- If he knew his mic was on,

10:30.163 --> 10:32.099
he wouldn't say bad stuff.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.702
- And he would never say
bad stuff about you guys.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.870
- Of course he would.
He's a dick.

10:36.904 --> 10:39.172
- Hey, what is that?
- Oh, this is weed.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.842
You wanna buy it?
- Sure.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.777
I have four dollars.
- Done.

10:43.811 --> 10:44.945
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh, no, no, Randy!

10:44.978 --> 10:46.146
- What? That's a great deal.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.048
- Come on, kids.
Let's go.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.050
- Yeah, let's go to a place
without any drugs.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.852
- Guys, that's the
best deal in the city.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.353
Don't forget it.
Tell your friends.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.055
I also got Molly.

10:55.088 --> 10:59.993
*

11:00.027 --> 11:03.063
- Now, kids, I need to know,
are there any peanut allergies?

11:03.096 --> 11:06.366
- Just let it happen.
We're not playing God.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.837
- I know somebody
who loves nuts.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.171
- Who?

11:11.204 --> 11:13.206
- Jimmy 1, Jimmy 2,

11:13.240 --> 11:16.009
Jimmy 3...
Where's Jimmy 4?

11:16.043 --> 11:17.444
- She was right here.
- Well, maybe

11:17.477 --> 11:19.813
she's off somewhere
choking on a peanut.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.314
- [chuckles]
You're getting dark today.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.350
- Hmm.
- Jimmy 4?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.085
Jimmy? Jimmy 4?

11:25.118 --> 11:26.920
- I knew this was gonna happen.
- Rebecca?

11:26.954 --> 11:29.089
We'll find her.
Don't worry. Oh, God.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.324
- [slurping]

11:31.358 --> 11:33.426
[sighs deeply] Well,
that does it for the whiskey.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.095
Daddy used to say

11:35.128 --> 11:37.264
that vodka
was for commies.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.767
But Daddy's not here.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.468
And the vodka is.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.470
- Oh, dear God.
- Oh...

11:43.503 --> 11:46.206
Brown before clear,
never fear.

11:46.239 --> 11:49.142
- Okay, I'm pretty sure
that's not a thing either.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.044
[both gasp]

11:51.078 --> 11:52.245
Oh, my God,
you have a hunting knife?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.114
- Why wouldn't I?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.116
Ooh, let's play a little game

11:56.149 --> 11:58.451
that I learned in the back room
of a Russian brothel.

11:58.485 --> 12:01.321
- Oh. Oh, no.
That's okay.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.390
- You know,
if you do it fast enough,

12:03.423 --> 12:05.826
it won't hurt if you miss.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.795
Hah! [pants]

12:07.828 --> 12:11.331
- [stammering]
No, no, I like my fingers.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.433
- I like mine too.
- Pussies.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.402
I like my face.
Punch it.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.470
- Oh, my God.
I'm not gonna punch your face.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.239
- Not you.
Miss Goody-Goody.

12:19.272 --> 12:21.341
Oh, that's funny.
It's like in "The Crucible."

12:21.374 --> 12:23.844
Everybody's either
Goody Proctor or Goody Goody.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.045
You'd be Goody Goody-Goody.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.047
[all laugh]

12:27.080 --> 12:29.316
Oh, sorry.
Theater nerd alert.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.018
- [stammering]

12:31.051 --> 12:34.254
- Now fucking punch me.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.924
- Uh, Brooke, you're--
you're really scaring me.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.326
- You either punch me,
or I'm gonna punch you.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.128
It's simple. One...

12:41.161 --> 12:42.830
Two...
- You know what?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.231
I'm gonna take Kelly
to hair and makeup.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.833
- Yeah. Okay.
- She looks good enough.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.067
- She does not!
She looks pasty and ugly!

12:47.100 --> 12:48.368
- Yeah.
- You let go

12:48.401 --> 12:50.070
of Kelly Rutherford!

12:50.103 --> 12:51.504
[all talking at once]

12:51.538 --> 12:52.806
You are gonna come with me.

12:52.840 --> 12:53.841
- Brooke--
[screams]

12:53.874 --> 12:55.242
- [gasps]

12:57.945 --> 12:59.146
Kelly!

13:04.251 --> 13:06.486
*

13:06.519 --> 13:08.188
- Okay, there's Staci

13:08.221 --> 13:12.192
eating cake out of
a trash can... again.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.161
- Phil. I need to locate
Kelly Rutherford.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.863
Can you check
the security cameras?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.364
- I'm gonna need you
to wait your turn.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.032
- No, it's urgent.
It's almost show time.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.968
- Fine, I'll check.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.236
Nope, I don't see her.
You shouldn't have let her out.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.538
- Let me know
if you see her.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.941
I don't know what this is,
but I don't care for it.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.510
- Care for that booty...

13:30.543 --> 13:33.246
- I didn't even look.
Could you tell? [giggles]

13:35.082 --> 13:36.583
- [gasps]
Oh, dear God.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.919
Tell me she's okay.
- She's dead.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.921
- What? Oh, my God.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.356
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
Holy fuck-balls!

13:43.390 --> 13:46.026
- [laughs] You know,
it's kind of invigorating.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.560
We just killed
Kelly Rutherford.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.029
- We didn't kill
Kelly Rutherford!

13:49.062 --> 13:50.563
You did!
- No.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.366
We did.
We're in this together.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.336
- No. [stammers]
We gotta get medical attention.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.372
We're gonna call the ambulance--
- She's fucking dead.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.641
Get it together.
- Okay, okay.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.076
We're gonna call the cops.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.244
We're gonna explain everything.

14:04.277 --> 14:05.913
It's gonna be totally fine.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.181
- What we need to do
is get rid of her.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.417
Do you have any of that acid
that's used to dissolve bodies?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.619
- What? No!

14:12.652 --> 14:15.155
I don't have any--
maybe in Jimmy's office--

14:15.188 --> 14:16.489
No!
We're not gonna put--

14:16.523 --> 14:18.258
- Listen to me!
Listen to me.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.228
Okay.
We need to get rid of her.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.563
Okay?
We need to make her disappear.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.999
No one knows
she was here.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.500
- Everyone knows she was here!

14:27.534 --> 14:30.070
Everyone knows she's here.
You're insane!

14:30.103 --> 14:32.105
- I am not insane.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.274
And who do you think
the cops are gonna believe?

14:34.307 --> 14:35.675
Hmm? You?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.045
Or a beloved Hollywood icon?

14:38.078 --> 14:39.947
[sobbing]
Oh, I'm sorry, Officer.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.283
She--she kept me hostage
and made me imbibe alcohol,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.318
and then when Kelly
started to try to leave,

14:45.352 --> 14:48.255
she pushed her into
the corner of that table.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.090
[sobbing]

14:50.123 --> 14:52.492
I'm sorry. Give the girl
a Golden Globe...

14:52.525 --> 14:54.928
for fuck's sake!
These tears are real!

14:54.962 --> 14:57.230
- Oh, my God, do not wipe
your psycho tears on me.

14:57.264 --> 14:58.966
- Listen, as long as we are

14:58.999 --> 15:01.134
being honest:
Juju Chang was right.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.970
Your accent? It sucked.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.372
- [gasps]
Oh, my God, you bitch.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.041
You said it was good.
- I lied.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.642
- [gasps] Oh, my God.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.212
This is not happening.
I just--

15:12.245 --> 15:14.381
I didn't kill
one of America's sweethearts.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.085
- Hey, I am America's
only sweetheart.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.620
Now, we need
to get rid of her.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.656
We are going to roll her body
up in this carpet,

15:23.690 --> 15:26.126
and put her in a dumpster.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.161
- No!

15:28.195 --> 15:33.200
- Oh, you know,
you could trip and fall too.

15:33.233 --> 15:34.567
- [gasps quietly]

15:36.503 --> 15:39.372
Okay, we gotta move
the coffee table.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.308
[both grunting]

15:41.341 --> 15:43.076
*

15:46.113 --> 15:52.986
*

15:53.786 --> 15:55.622
- Oh, my God,
this is so heavy.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.324
- [scoffs]
Suck it up, fat ass.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.292
- Hey, you said
it was skinny upstairs.

15:59.326 --> 16:02.629
- Another lie.
- [panting]

16:02.662 --> 16:04.531
[door clicks open]
- [grunts]

16:04.564 --> 16:06.166
- There you guys are.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.634
What's going on
with this rug?

16:07.667 --> 16:10.003
- Oh, you know,
I, um, I...

16:10.037 --> 16:12.472
I spilled a kale smoothie
on it, and I didn't want

16:12.505 --> 16:14.274
someone to have to
clean it up, so here we are.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.309
- No, no, no, no, no.
I can get someone

16:16.343 --> 16:17.710
to deal with that.
- No, I insist.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.079
And that's
a really great jacket.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.247
- Oh! Thank you.

16:20.280 --> 16:21.448
- Yeah.
[both laugh]

16:21.481 --> 16:22.749
- By the way, Davis Maxfield.

16:22.782 --> 16:24.451
We met at the Oscars
in 2013.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.119
- Oh, of course.

16:26.153 --> 16:27.520
How are you, Davis?

16:27.554 --> 16:30.323
- Good, good.
Just doing my thing.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.292
Talent producing,
trying to find lost celebs.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.061
You know.
- Well, I just saw Kelly

16:34.094 --> 16:35.562
go to hair and makeup.
- Oh!

16:35.595 --> 16:37.264
Good.
Thank you so much.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.033
You're a lifesaver.
[both laugh]

16:40.067 --> 16:41.268
- [exhales]

16:42.769 --> 16:44.737
- Okay.
[grunting]

16:44.771 --> 16:46.773
Back to work.
Let's go.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.542
- [panting heavily]

16:49.576 --> 16:53.480
- Oh! Oh!
Look what you did, you idiot.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.648
[exasperated sigh]

16:55.682 --> 16:57.750
What the fuck?

16:57.784 --> 17:00.153
- Oh, my God.
That's one of Jimmy's kids

17:00.187 --> 17:02.355
from his sperm charity.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.424
Um, sweetie,
why don't you go inside?

17:04.457 --> 17:05.758
[mouths word] Okay?

17:05.792 --> 17:07.294
Run as fast as you can.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.396
- She's seen too much.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.664
We have to kill her.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.434
- Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.270
- That sounds creepy.
- Okay, um...

17:17.304 --> 17:19.606
Come out, little girl.
I have candy for you.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.441
- Much better.
- Todd,

17:21.474 --> 17:22.609
what's going on here?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.111
- Have you seen Jimmy 4?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.213
- No.
- Ah, she's missing.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.548
- Missing children?
[sighs softly]

17:28.581 --> 17:30.850
When my two children
went missing,

17:30.883 --> 17:33.453
my government told me
not to ask questions

17:33.486 --> 17:36.256
and to stop looking.
I suggest you do the same.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.558
- Why weren't you
watching her?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.693
- Oh, I get it.
You get to be the fun one,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.662
but I have to be
the warden?

17:42.695 --> 17:44.664
- Well, Jimmy's
gonna kill me, not you.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.466
- Jimmy's not gonna kill you.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.468
- [sighs]
- He's gonna hire a specialist

17:48.501 --> 17:50.570
to kill you.
They'll never find your body.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.406
- Yeah.
- She scares me.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.243
And she smells like cabbage.
- Shut up.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.877
You're terrible parents.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.479
- Yeah, but especially her!

17:59.512 --> 18:01.414
She forced me to bring 'em
out of the room.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.416
And now Jimmy 4's
probably bleeding out

18:03.450 --> 18:05.252
in a gutter somewhere.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.354
- Oh, so I should just
keep them locked in a room

18:07.387 --> 18:09.289
so they never
grow wings and fly.

18:09.322 --> 18:11.291
I want them to fly.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.726
- We don't even know you.
- Yes, you do.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.895
We met hours ago.
What are we even fighting about?

18:15.928 --> 18:18.565
This is not about the kids.
This is about us.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.135
- What? No, it's about
the missing kid.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.437
- Yes, that--
yes, you are--right.

18:24.471 --> 18:27.640
*

18:29.276 --> 18:31.811
- Aren't you pretty?

18:31.844 --> 18:33.680
Hey, do you like

18:33.713 --> 18:35.615
to play dress-up
and pretend?

18:35.648 --> 18:38.218
Oh, of course you do.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.454
I'm gonna teach you
a make-pretend game, okay?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.623
Now, but you
have to close your eyes,

18:43.656 --> 18:46.226
and it'll only
take a minute

18:46.259 --> 18:47.827
and then
it'll all be over.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.662
- Enough! Enough.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.265
If you are gonna k--
K-I-L-L this little girl,

18:52.299 --> 18:53.766
you're gonna have to
do it through me,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.503
because I am a good person
and you are not.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.872
- You have no idea
who you're messing with.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.942
Me and Satan?
We're in the same book club.

19:02.975 --> 19:06.513
- Okay, that's more
confusing than scary.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.715
- Jimmy 4!
- Uncle Todd!

19:08.748 --> 19:11.684
She wants to kill me.
- What?

19:11.718 --> 19:14.287
- Oh, I just think she wanted
to be with her mommy and daddy.

19:14.321 --> 19:16.756
- Okay. Well, go find
Jimmy 1, 2, and 3.

19:16.789 --> 19:17.957
- [laughing] Okay.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.859
- Our family is whole again!

19:19.892 --> 19:22.562
- [sighs]
- You know, these kids

19:22.595 --> 19:24.731
would be lucky
to have you as their dad.

19:24.764 --> 19:27.734
- Aw... Hey, you'd make
a pretty good dad yourself.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.403
- Well, we make
a pretty good couple

19:30.437 --> 19:32.639
of parent--teammates!

19:32.672 --> 19:34.641
[both laugh]
- Yeah, dude.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.476
- [giggling] Ooh, okay.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.678
- Yeah, all right.
Yeah. Whoo!

19:38.711 --> 19:40.313
- Ah, Jesus. I thought
they'd never shut up.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.448
All right, come on.
Let's get this body

19:41.481 --> 19:42.815
into the dumpster...

19:42.849 --> 19:44.951
And be done with it.
[muffled noises]

19:44.984 --> 19:47.987
- Did you feel that?
Did you hear that?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.922
Kelly Rutherford is alive!

19:49.956 --> 19:51.324
[thud]

19:51.358 --> 19:54.327
- Yay. Thank God.

19:54.361 --> 19:57.530
- Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.798
Oh, my God.
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly!

19:58.831 --> 20:01.501
- Oh!
- [gasps]

20:01.534 --> 20:04.471
- Oh, my God,
why am I on a rug...

20:04.504 --> 20:06.273
next to a dumpster?

20:06.306 --> 20:07.940
- Well, you just got
a little drunk, honey.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.509
- Whoo!
- Yeah, that's it.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.843
Just a little tipsy.
- All right.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.545
- Here you go.
How's your head?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.381
- Ooh, ow.
- Ooh, I'll get you some ice.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.915
I'm gonna get you some ice.
- Did I miss my segment?

20:15.948 --> 20:17.484
- No, no.
You didn't miss your segment.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.452
And isn't America lucky?
- [murmurs]

20:19.486 --> 20:21.288
- Okay, you know what, I've
gotta go to hair and makeup.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.889
Why don't I take you, okay?
- Oh, that's great.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.491
Thanks, Brooke.
- All right, great.

20:24.524 --> 20:25.758
All right, we'll get you
some ice, and...

20:25.792 --> 20:28.395
- Oh, hi.
- We're good, thank you.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.663
- Oh, wow.
- Shh.

20:30.697 --> 20:32.365
- What happened?
That's so strange.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.467
- Oh, it's just--
we had a fun time.

20:34.501 --> 20:37.036
We had a party!
It was fun, and...

20:37.069 --> 20:39.339
