00:08.356 --> 00:11.228
JEFF:
The Bible says a lot about love.

00:11.272 --> 00:12.490
"Love thy neighbor."

00:12.534 --> 00:15.189
"For God so loved the world."

00:15.232 --> 00:17.539
In First Corinthians, it
says, "Love is patient,

00:17.582 --> 00:19.062
love is kind."

00:19.106 --> 00:23.327
But what does it mean
to truly love someone?

00:23.371 --> 00:25.025
You see, Jesus showed us...

00:25.068 --> 00:27.027
You see that?

00:27.070 --> 00:29.072
No. But keep talking.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.204
Why?

00:30.247 --> 00:31.857
'Cause I'm trying
to unwrap a candy,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.903
and I don't want
anybody to hear.

00:33.946 --> 00:36.210
How come she gets candy?
I want candy.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.907
How come you're
not shushing them?

00:37.950 --> 00:40.170
Shh! Shh.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.694
JEFF:
Sometimes love is about

00:42.738 --> 00:44.827
the little things. A smile.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.481
Asking about their day.

00:46.524 --> 00:48.091
Writing an encouraging note.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.445
See? He's talking about Robin.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.099
Who is Robin?

00:56.143 --> 00:58.319
Pastor Jeff's girlfriend.

00:58.362 --> 01:01.017
Mom set them up,
and now she thinks she's cool.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.715
Shh. But I did set them up.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.239
Cool.JEFF:
So, let's see

01:05.282 --> 01:07.197
what Jesus has
to say about that.

01:07.241 --> 01:10.200
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:10.244 --> 01:13.029
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain

01:13.073 --> 01:15.510
♪ I bet I could be your hero

01:15.553 --> 01:18.339
♪ I am a mighty little man

01:18.382 --> 01:22.212
♪ I am a mighty little man.♪

01:25.824 --> 01:28.044
Thanks for coming.Pastor Jeff,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.220
do chickens go to heaven?

01:30.264 --> 01:33.919
Well, the Bible doesn't say much
about the souls of animals,

01:33.963 --> 01:37.575
but I like to believe that God
loves all his creatures. Why?

01:37.619 --> 01:39.577
My dad wants to eat Matilda.

01:40.752 --> 01:42.319
It's not as bad as it sounds.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.755
She stopped laying eggs,

01:43.799 --> 01:45.844
so it's off with her head
and into the fryer.

01:45.888 --> 01:49.935
Well, I will pray
for her little chicken soul.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.590
Just pray she's juicy.

01:52.634 --> 01:54.853
Hello, Coopers. Nice to see you,

01:54.897 --> 01:57.595
as always.Lovely sermon today.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.380
I wouldn't know. I couldn't hear

01:59.423 --> 02:01.077
over all the candy wrappers
and gossip.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.035
That's enough. Move along.Actually,

02:03.079 --> 02:04.385
Mary, can I speak to you
for a sec?

02:04.428 --> 02:06.300
Sure. Um, I'll be right there.

02:06.343 --> 02:09.172
Yeah, make it quick. I
don't want to miss kickoff.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.174
Church andfootball?

02:11.218 --> 02:13.568
At least 60 Minutes
is on tonight.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.960
Everything okay?

02:15.004 --> 02:16.397
Everything's wonderful.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.051
We're trying to keep
this quiet, but...

02:19.095 --> 02:20.836
We have decided to get married.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.664
Oh, my gosh!

02:22.707 --> 02:24.318
Oh, my gosh.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.363
And we were hoping that you
could help us plan the wedding.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.322
Oh, my gosh!

02:28.365 --> 02:30.193
I did it again. I'm sorry.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.935
Um, I would be honored.

02:32.978 --> 02:33.979
Oh.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.677
Just something
small and simple.

02:35.720 --> 02:38.245
So, when were you thinking?
Uh, spring, summer?

02:38.288 --> 02:39.246
Next Sunday.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.377
Uh, oh.

02:40.421 --> 02:41.726
That is soon.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.337
Uh, you're not...?

02:44.425 --> 02:45.426
No.

02:45.469 --> 02:46.862
Because we haven't,
you know...

02:46.905 --> 02:48.211
But we would like to.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.604
But we can't 'cause
I'm a pastor.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.432
But we can
once we're married.

02:51.475 --> 02:52.259
So Sunday it is.

02:52.302 --> 02:55.479
Okay.Or maybe Saturday.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.569
Ooh, Saturday. Even better.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.571
I cannot wait.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.399
Me, either.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.749
Still here.

03:04.793 --> 03:05.750
Hmm.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.803
George,

03:14.846 --> 03:17.327
you will not believe
what I get to do.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.199
What's that?

03:19.242 --> 03:21.375
Plan Pastor Jeff's wedding.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.985
Oh, isn't that nice.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.682
Oh, it's gonna be
a lot of work.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.684
They want this done
by next weekend.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.469
What, he knock her up?

03:28.512 --> 03:29.731
Been there.

03:30.775 --> 03:33.213
No. He is a man of God.

03:33.256 --> 03:35.040
He cannot have
a physical relationship

03:35.084 --> 03:36.868
outside holy matrimony.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.001
Oh, so that'sthe rush.

03:39.044 --> 03:41.351
Well, yes,

03:41.395 --> 03:44.441
but they also seem
very much in love.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.400
Love is great.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.099
Anyway, I am gonna
be extra busy,

03:50.142 --> 03:52.275
so I'm gonna need you
to pick up the slack

03:52.319 --> 03:53.885
around here.
You know?

03:53.929 --> 03:55.539
The kids.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.237
Making meals.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.629
Sounds good.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.109
Wait, what?

04:00.152 --> 04:02.111
I need you to help out.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.811
So, Pastor Jeff
wants to get lucky,

04:06.855 --> 04:08.204
and I pay the price?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.989
I am asking you to take
care of your children.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.861
And I'm asking you,
why can't your mother do it?

04:12.904 --> 04:14.602
George.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.604
Fine.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.301
ANNOUNCER: That has to be
the play of the game,

04:18.345 --> 04:20.303
maybe even the season!

04:21.783 --> 04:24.525
And I can't believe
what I just saw.

04:26.004 --> 04:28.224
Your dad can't
eat Matilda.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.878
Sure, he can.
He eats everything.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.662
Billy, you've raised her
from a chick.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.316
She's like your child.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.318
You wouldn't let somebody
eat your child.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.496
Does my child
taste like chicken?

04:39.540 --> 04:40.758
Billy!

04:40.802 --> 04:42.760
Missy!

04:45.589 --> 04:46.764
ADULT SHELDON:
Many inventions

04:46.808 --> 04:48.418
changed people's lives
for the better:

04:48.462 --> 04:50.638
the light bulb,
the polio vaccine,

04:50.681 --> 04:52.553
and one that doesn't get
enough credit,

04:52.596 --> 04:56.426
the home video cassette
recorder.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.776
It didn't help keep people
out of wheelchairs,

04:58.820 --> 05:00.691
but it did keep me
from missingStar Trek.

05:00.735 --> 05:04.565
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 44307.3.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.349
I am preparing to leave

05:09.918 --> 05:13.530
♪ In the darkness,

♪ Don't you worry...

Georgie, why are there

05:29.024 --> 05:31.896
bathing suit ladies
where Captain Picard should be?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.811
Georgie!

05:33.855 --> 05:36.292
He's not home.
What's going on?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.990
Georgie taped over Star
Trek: The Next Generation.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.557
So? Watch something else.

05:40.601 --> 05:42.037
I don't want to watch
something else.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.647
I want to watch Star Trek:
The Next Generation.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.823
And I want to feel bad
for you, but I don't.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.173
The television station's
in Houston.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.567
Drive me there.
I'm sure they have a copy of it.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.569
I'm not driving to Houston.

05:52.613 --> 05:56.181
Well, then, I should warn you,
I am very unhappy.

05:56.225 --> 05:57.792
Okay.

05:57.835 --> 05:59.707
In fact, I am peeved.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.491
Okay.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.887
I would slam this door
right now,

06:05.930 --> 06:08.498
but it would startle me,
so just imagine I did.

06:11.283 --> 06:13.590
Okay.

06:13.634 --> 06:16.811
I'm sorry Robin
couldn't be here.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.552
She's working extra shifts
so she can take some time off

06:18.595 --> 06:19.683
after the wedding.

06:19.727 --> 06:21.511
For a honeymoon? How nice.

06:21.555 --> 06:22.904
Where y'all going?

06:22.947 --> 06:25.385
Oh, we don't really plan
on leaving the bedroom.

06:26.473 --> 06:30.172
Well, um, we have
a lot to discuss.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.435
Reception, flowers, cake...

06:32.479 --> 06:35.569
Like I said, we're just looking
for something simple.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.571
Got it. Nothing fancy.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.616
Just... elegant.

06:39.660 --> 06:43.707
Right, but a plain,
bare-bones elegance.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.840
How many guests
were you thinking?

06:45.883 --> 06:48.408
It doesn't have to be big.
I've been married before.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.539
But Robin hasn't.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.236
And you're our pastor.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.283
Your congregation is gonna want
to share in your special day.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.633
Those bones
are sounding less bare.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.069
Sorry.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.897
Your small, elegant,

06:59.941 --> 07:03.161
bare-bones, unforgettable,
simple, special day.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.947
Now, let's talk centerpieces.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.427
ADULT SHELDON:
None of my friends

07:07.470 --> 07:09.037
had recorded the episode.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.388
I called Tam.
I called Dr. Sturgis.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.825
Those were all my friends.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.176
PICARD: Engage.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.701
Fortunately,
having a modem granted me

07:20.744 --> 07:22.703
access to an even better
kind of friend:

07:22.746 --> 07:25.357
the kind you don't have to see
or talk to.

07:58.608 --> 08:01.785
Why would you bring that pecking
poop machine into our home?

08:01.829 --> 08:03.047
To save her life.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.135
What about my life?

08:04.179 --> 08:05.485
She's not trying to kill you.

08:05.528 --> 08:08.270
Oh, yeah? Then why was
there hate in her eyes?

08:08.313 --> 08:10.098
That's how everybody
looks at you.

08:10.141 --> 08:11.795
GEORGE SR.:
I got lunch!

08:11.839 --> 08:13.754
Dad, Missy put a
chicken in my room!

08:13.797 --> 08:15.930
The Sparks were gonna
kill her and eat her!

08:15.973 --> 08:17.671
The hell's going on?

08:18.715 --> 08:20.543
How could you?

08:20.587 --> 08:21.675
What?

08:28.812 --> 08:30.597
I miss your mother.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.559
Would you look
at these sugar flowers?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.866
I'm too busy looking
at the price tag.

08:38.909 --> 08:40.389
Judas Priest.

08:40.432 --> 08:42.565
Oh, you can't skimp
on the cake.

08:42.609 --> 08:44.785
It's the focal point
of the entire wedding.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.830
How about this? We get
a bunch of Ding Dongs,

08:46.874 --> 08:48.571
stack them in the
shape of a heart.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.703
Everybody's happy.

08:49.746 --> 08:51.748
You do not want your wife
to look back

08:51.792 --> 08:54.490
at her wedding pictures
and see a pile of Ding Dongs.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.144
I'm not sure she's gonna care.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.798
She gonna care!

08:59.495 --> 09:02.846
But there are more affordable
cakes here that we can look at.

09:02.890 --> 09:04.108
Thank you.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.893
Maybe they have
some stale ones in the back

09:05.936 --> 09:07.895
that you can disappoint
your bride with.

09:13.335 --> 09:15.859
All right, here I am.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.557
What's the emergency?

09:17.600 --> 09:19.646
Sheldon's mad at Georgie 'cause
he taped over his space show,

09:19.689 --> 09:21.038
but now he's hiding
in the garage

09:21.082 --> 09:22.605
'cause Missy brought
home Billy's chicken.

09:22.649 --> 09:23.780
And Missy's hiding
in the bathroom

09:23.824 --> 09:25.521
'cause I brought
home fried chicken.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.523
Good luck.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.264
Oh, come on, help me out!

09:29.307 --> 09:30.918
What are you doing to help?

09:30.961 --> 09:32.180
I called your
ass over here.

09:32.223 --> 09:33.398
Where's Mary?

09:33.442 --> 09:35.313
At church planning
Pastor Jeff's wedding.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.880
And she left you in charge?

09:36.924 --> 09:38.621
Yeah.Well, that was dumb.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.449
Thank you.Okay.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.668
Let's split up.

09:41.711 --> 09:43.887
You want live chicken
or dead chicken?

09:44.801 --> 09:45.933
Hey.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.325
Right in there.Hi.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.110
Hello.Hi.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.720
See ya.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.684
I'll take the chicken problems.

09:57.727 --> 09:58.946
Girl in bedroom?

09:58.989 --> 10:01.513
All yours.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.653
Oh.

10:16.224 --> 10:18.269
Would you like to try it on?Oh, no.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.923
I'm not here for me.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.359
Just helping a friend.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.883
Oh, too bad.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.885
That dress would be
stunning on you.

10:24.928 --> 10:27.061
Oh, I would look
like a princess.

10:28.279 --> 10:30.107
What do you think?

10:30.151 --> 10:31.456
How handsome!

10:31.500 --> 10:33.763
I feel like I'm in the presence
of James Bond.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.983
Well, I don't have
a license to kill,

10:36.026 --> 10:38.681
but I do have a license
to officiate funerals.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.249
Should we pull
some dresses for Robin?

10:41.292 --> 10:43.773
I suppose. How about that?

10:43.817 --> 10:46.080
Oh, she'd hate that.
Keep looking.

10:49.126 --> 10:50.562
Oh.

10:50.606 --> 10:53.348
Come on, and bring that bucket
of chicken out of there.

10:53.391 --> 10:54.915
MISSY:
No, we're not
eating it.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.264
What if it was
Matilda's friend?

10:56.307 --> 10:58.266
Honey, that one's from Kentucky.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.790
They didn't know each other.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.836
MEEMAW:
George.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.489
Why are you not
in that bedroom?

11:04.533 --> 11:07.623
Well, I'm just thinking
of what to say.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.755
They're teenagers.

11:08.798 --> 11:11.192
If you wait any longer,
they'll be done.

11:11.235 --> 11:13.107
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

11:13.150 --> 11:15.457
George!

11:15.500 --> 11:16.893
Georgie?

11:16.937 --> 11:19.983
♪ Out on the streets,
that's where we'll meet... ♪

11:20.027 --> 11:21.158
What?

11:21.202 --> 11:22.769
Door stays open.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.945
Why? We're just
listening to music.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.729
My house, my rules.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.600
And don't sit on the bed.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.254
Where are we supposed to sit?

11:30.298 --> 11:32.692
Just... not on the bed.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.389
Whatever.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.915
♪ That you would
end up winning... ♪

11:38.959 --> 11:41.788
He's just mad 'cause
we're young and he's not.

11:41.831 --> 11:44.007
Done. I made 'em
sit on the floor.

11:44.051 --> 11:47.010
Smart. Nobody ever
got pregnant on the floor.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.798
Have you had the talk
with that boy?Of course.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.277
Really? What'd you say?

11:53.321 --> 11:56.628
You know, the stuff...

11:56.672 --> 11:59.936
you know, a father says when
he has a talk with his son.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.852
Good Lord. Did you tell him
about protection?

12:02.896 --> 12:04.854
Oh, come on, Connie.Well, it's important.

12:04.898 --> 12:07.378
What if he knocks that
poor girl up and ruins her life?

12:07.422 --> 12:09.685
Is that a swipe at me?Well, it depends.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.819
Did you knock up my daughter
and ruin her life?

12:12.862 --> 12:14.908
Wait. I know the answer.

12:14.951 --> 12:18.955
Hey, for your information,
Mary is very happy.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.049
Robin's gonna look
so beautiful in this.

12:26.093 --> 12:29.531
Your wedding's gonna be perfect.

12:29.574 --> 12:32.012
Great. Thank you.

12:32.055 --> 12:33.665
She won't have

12:33.709 --> 12:36.538
to go down to city hall wearing
the only thing that still fits

12:36.581 --> 12:38.888
'cause she's trying to hide
the fact that she's pregnant.

12:38.932 --> 12:41.543
Uh-huh.

12:41.586 --> 12:44.938
She's gonna get the wedding
of her dreams.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.114
If she cries on the dress,

12:47.157 --> 12:48.550
do I have to buy it?

12:51.683 --> 12:54.034
You know it takes two people
to get pregnant, right?

12:54.077 --> 12:55.426
I know that.
Does Georgie?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.211
Probably. We
got cable now.

12:58.255 --> 12:59.648
Dad?

12:59.691 --> 13:00.997
What?

13:01.041 --> 13:02.956
Is Matilda still
in my closet?

13:02.999 --> 13:03.957
What?

13:04.000 --> 13:05.219
That's a "yes."

13:05.262 --> 13:06.524
MISSY:
Aah!

13:06.568 --> 13:08.570
The bathroom's flooding!

13:09.876 --> 13:11.703
What happened?I flushed a chicken leg,

13:11.747 --> 13:13.880
and water started
going everywhere.

13:13.923 --> 13:16.056
Chickens were your job!

13:24.064 --> 13:27.067
Maybe I'm being punished.
Maybe I'm a bad person.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.201
That went in my mouth.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.856
Stay back!

13:33.900 --> 13:36.250
Calm down. We're
taking her home.

13:36.293 --> 13:37.729
To be murdered.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.557
Okay, have fun.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.734
Can y'all keep it down?

13:42.778 --> 13:44.780
I have a bone
to pick with you, sir.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.999
What'd I do?

13:46.042 --> 13:47.914
You taped over
my Star Trekepisode.

13:47.957 --> 13:48.915
So?

13:48.958 --> 13:51.656
So, now I may never
get to see it.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.049
What if it was a two-parter?

13:53.093 --> 13:56.096
I can't start a two-parter
on part two. That's madness.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.098
I think I'm gonna go.

13:58.141 --> 13:59.534
Okay.

13:59.577 --> 14:00.752
Hola, señorita.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.711
She's in my Spanish class.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.191
I'll call you later.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.107
Te veo mañana en la clase de español.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.673
What?

14:08.717 --> 14:10.632
That means, "See you tomorrow
in Spanish class."

14:10.675 --> 14:12.808
I was going to ask
how you thought you did

14:12.852 --> 14:15.550
on Friday's quiz, but I'm
guessing the answer is no bueno.

14:17.334 --> 14:19.249
Adios.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.034
What?

14:23.601 --> 14:25.168
I'm sorry.

14:25.212 --> 14:29.085
This is your wedding,
and I'm making it all about me.

14:29.129 --> 14:31.609
No. I mean, you are,
but it's fine.

14:31.653 --> 14:35.135
It's just, every bride dreams
of walking down the aisle,

14:35.178 --> 14:37.180
and I never got to have that.

14:37.224 --> 14:39.400
Still on you. Okay.

14:39.443 --> 14:41.184
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

14:41.228 --> 14:45.014
Hey, even though I'm looking
fly, I'm still your pastor.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.147
Well...

14:47.190 --> 14:49.540
it's more than the wedding.

14:49.584 --> 14:53.153
Overnight, I became
a wife and a mother.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.720
I feel like
I missed out on a lot.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.114
Well, sometimes the Lord
has his own plans for us.

14:58.158 --> 15:00.769
And if it helps, Robin
and I always talk about

15:00.812 --> 15:02.858
how much we admire
you and your family.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.686
Really?

15:04.729 --> 15:07.080
Your marriage may have
gotten off to a rough start,

15:07.123 --> 15:09.473
but if that's what it took
to get where you are,

15:09.517 --> 15:11.171
maybe God knew
what he was doing.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.783
You know what?

15:14.826 --> 15:16.698
Let's get back
to planning your wedding.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.048
Oh, no. You're done.
You may be a great wife

15:19.092 --> 15:20.963
and mother, but
you stink at this.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.312
That's fair.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.142
Do I have to?

15:26.186 --> 15:28.579
You want to add grandkids
to this mess?

15:28.623 --> 15:29.885
God, no.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.365
Georgie, we need to talk.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.107
What now?

15:37.153 --> 15:40.156
You're of an age
where your body has...

15:40.200 --> 15:41.723
urges.

15:41.766 --> 15:43.377
Oh, my God!

15:43.420 --> 15:44.987
Georgie, you need
to hear this.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.380
From both of you?

15:46.423 --> 15:49.165
W-Well, who do you want
to hear it from?

15:49.209 --> 15:52.516
No one. But if I got
to pick, I guess you.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.909
Good choice.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.477
Don't forget to tell him
about venereal disease.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.395
MAN:
This next part's so great.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.701
WESLEY CRUSHER :
Yes, sir. I'm aware of that.

16:08.706 --> 16:10.491
The Academy?

16:10.534 --> 16:13.407
PICARD:
I just received a message
from Admiral Nsomeka.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.974
She expects you...

16:15.017 --> 16:16.453
What's going on here?

16:16.497 --> 16:19.152
Wesley Crusher was just accepted
into Starfleet Academy,

16:19.195 --> 16:21.371
and for his final mission,
he's accompanying Picard

16:21.415 --> 16:24.113
on a shuttle mission
to Pentarus Five.

16:24.157 --> 16:27.160
No. I mean...
who's your friend?

16:27.203 --> 16:29.205
Oh, he's not a friend.
He's a stranger.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.207
I met him on a Star
Trekbulletin board.

16:31.251 --> 16:32.861
He had a copy
of the episode

16:32.904 --> 16:34.428
Georgie taped over
and brought it here.

16:34.471 --> 16:38.214
Hello. I'm Nathan.

16:38.258 --> 16:42.523
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave... Nathan.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.307
Okay.

16:44.351 --> 16:46.353
But I'm taking
my tape with me.That's fine.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.703
No. I need to see the end.No, you don't!

16:49.921 --> 16:51.967
Does anyone read us?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.925
And I know your
mom would want me

16:53.969 --> 16:55.318
to tell you to
wait till marriage,

16:55.362 --> 16:58.539
but I also know...
you're probably not going to.

16:58.582 --> 17:00.193
Did you?

17:01.324 --> 17:03.370
The important thing is
that when you're with a girl...

17:06.547 --> 17:09.115
You know how when
we're running practice drills

17:09.158 --> 17:13.162
and we wear protection
so both people are safe?

17:13.206 --> 17:14.381
Yeah.

17:14.424 --> 17:17.253
Well, there you go.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.081
What?

17:19.125 --> 17:22.215
Same thing,
but with your privates.

17:22.258 --> 17:24.782
Please leave.Thank you.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.307
PICARD:
Wesley,

17:27.350 --> 17:30.223
you will be missed.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.922
That was excellent.

17:33.965 --> 17:35.489
Yeah, top notch.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.273
Get out!

17:37.317 --> 17:39.101
Yeah, I think that
turned out pretty--

17:39.145 --> 17:40.363
Who the hell is this?

17:40.407 --> 17:42.887
This is Nathan. He's
been to four Comic-Cons.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.193
And he's leaving.

17:44.237 --> 17:45.368
Are you sure?

17:45.412 --> 17:48.067
Beam your ass out of here.

17:48.110 --> 17:50.069
Yes, ma'am.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.420
One to beam up.

17:53.463 --> 17:55.074
Energize.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.817
ADULT SHELDON:
Okay, that last part
didn't happen,

17:59.861 --> 18:01.254
but, boy,
would that have been neat.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.647
That was so neat.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.390
Forgot my tape.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.789
Energize.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.227
I miss him already.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.667
Robin and Jeffrey,
by their solemn vows

18:23.711 --> 18:25.887
freely made before God...

18:25.930 --> 18:29.673
ADULT SHELDON:
Pastor Jeff and Officer Robin
finally had their ceremony,

18:29.717 --> 18:33.112
which was nice for them, but meant I had to go to church

18:33.155 --> 18:35.853
on a Saturday
and watch old people kiss.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.247
You may kiss the bride.
