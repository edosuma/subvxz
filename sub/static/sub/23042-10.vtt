<i> Previously on</i> The Chi...

00:07.154 --> 00:10.260
I wanna confess to the
murder of Coogie Johnson.

00:11.357 --> 00:13.717
- I quit.
- What? Why?

00:13.717 --> 00:15.383
Trying to do the right thing, I guess.

00:15.485 --> 00:18.253
It would be nice to
start something of my own.

00:18.355 --> 00:20.359
<i> A food truck, but I</i>
<i>don't have the money for that.</i>

00:20.559 --> 00:22.425
Even if the house sells tomorrow,

00:22.527 --> 00:23.993
it could take three months,

00:24.096 --> 00:25.595
if not longer for you to get paid.

00:25.697 --> 00:27.263
They can get that truck fixed.

00:27.365 --> 00:29.765
- What you got, big man?
- Soul food in a taco.

00:29.867 --> 00:32.040
It says right there, you his father.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.663
- I just want you to do better.
- I'm tryin'.

00:36.040 --> 00:39.475
I see that; it's not all about you anymore.

00:39.577 --> 00:42.244
EJ's good, but his mama is... damn.

00:42.346 --> 00:44.379
- She's back?
- Yeah, and she's staying

00:44.482 --> 00:46.181
- with some random dude.
- Who killed

00:46.283 --> 00:48.783
that basketball star up
near your stash house?

00:49.083 --> 00:50.619
Trice did your boy.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.387
Look, man, we worried about you.

00:52.490 --> 00:54.156
- Don't be.
- What about school?

00:54.258 --> 00:56.658
- Reg didn't go to school.
- Yeah, he's a drug dealer.

00:56.683 --> 00:57.926
You happen to see Trice around?

00:57.951 --> 00:59.105
Yeah, I picked him up this morning

00:59.130 --> 01:00.315
and dropped him off at his crib.

Take little man outside and wait.

02:07.062 --> 02:08.201
All right.

02:09.064 --> 02:11.287
Didn't I tell you to wait
your ass outside? Come on.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.634
Stanley, your shuffle's
really coming along.

02:15.736 --> 02:18.304
Kevin, I'm gonna need you to project.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.639
You have a really good voice. Use it.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.575
He's just afraid of greatness, Mr. Gasca.

02:22.600 --> 02:23.789
Man, shut up, Papa.

02:24.579 --> 02:27.045
- You guys talk to Jake?
- You talk to those dancers?

02:27.147 --> 02:28.821
The ones messing up our play?

02:29.282 --> 02:32.250
I will. Now, did you talk to Jake?

02:32.352 --> 02:34.853
- Yeah, we did.
- He's exploring other options,

02:34.878 --> 02:37.501
Mr. Gasca, in the family business.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.416
- Family business?
- Yeah, with his brother Reg.

02:41.895 --> 02:44.194
I've been praying for
him every night, Mr. Gasca.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.730
Even whittled a cross for him,

02:45.832 --> 02:48.324
but my mom says he's lost his way.

02:48.568 --> 02:50.701
Well, sometimes you
gotta do more than that.

02:51.476 --> 02:53.735
Maybe I'll have a chat
with this brother of his.

02:53.735 --> 02:56.101
I wouldn't do that if I was you, Mr. Gasca.

02:56.126 --> 02:58.861
- Reg is a bad mother.
- Real bad.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.394
I'll take that into consideration.

03:02.051 --> 03:04.344
But for tonight, our play needs us.

03:05.028 --> 03:07.297
Let's see about this
yellow brick road, huh?

03:23.159 --> 03:25.040
Hey. Hey!

03:26.420 --> 03:27.629
Look at me.

03:31.437 --> 03:33.055
So, Michael,

03:34.710 --> 03:36.375
how do you wanna do this?

03:47.318 --> 03:49.497
My mother needs to be
able to look at me after.

03:49.909 --> 03:51.644
Hm. Okay.

03:52.425 --> 03:55.227
I'll tell you what, you
tell me what I wanna know

03:55.969 --> 03:57.086
and...

03:58.749 --> 04:00.515
the knife stays right here.

04:03.928 --> 04:05.670
I take you on your word on that.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.626
I spoke with your friend, Wallace.

04:10.824 --> 04:12.004
The cop.

04:16.439 --> 04:19.062
He told me you were
the one who shot my boy.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.030
Your boy?

04:27.654 --> 04:29.547
<i> I'll be there in, like, ten.</i>

04:30.790 --> 04:32.488
No. Of course I love you.

04:32.590 --> 04:35.446
I mean, my ass is out here
getting you ice cream, ain't I?

04:36.093 --> 04:38.267
No.

04:39.553 --> 04:40.952
All right, all right.

04:41.698 --> 04:42.695
Okay.

04:45.335 --> 04:46.326
Hold on.

04:52.509 --> 04:55.017
- Wait.
- We got eyes. Lock up. Lock up.

04:55.445 --> 04:58.078
Hey, lemme... lemme call
you... Lemme call you back.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.725
Hey. You lost, youngblood?

05:10.750 --> 05:12.124
Who you got on the phone?

05:12.995 --> 05:14.094

05:22.171 --> 05:24.905
Oh. You look like you
was playing hide and seek.

05:25.007 --> 05:26.554
What you doin' around here?

05:27.443 --> 05:28.942
I was goin' to my girl house.

05:28.967 --> 05:31.334
She... just gettin' her... Gettin' her...

05:31.359 --> 05:32.802
Gettin' her ice cream.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.967
Oh, that's cute.

05:36.518 --> 05:37.984
What kinda ice cream you get her?

05:39.388 --> 05:40.872
Mint... mint chocolate chip.

05:42.481 --> 05:43.846
Not bad.

05:44.837 --> 05:46.769
All right. Look, I didn't see nothin'.

05:46.794 --> 05:48.324
I... I didn't see nothin'.

05:50.298 --> 05:52.120
Who said anything about seeing something?

05:58.606 --> 06:00.746
Nigga, what was you doin' hiding there?

06:27.629 --> 06:29.154
I had no choice.

06:33.574 --> 06:34.856
They gon' kill him?

06:35.642 --> 06:38.353
Don't matter. The man
said wait, we gon' wait.

06:38.812 --> 06:40.621
- But what happens next?
- Bro.

06:41.014 --> 06:42.257
See, that's why I knew I shouldn't have

06:42.282 --> 06:43.512
brought your ass with me.

06:44.484 --> 06:45.804
I'm good.

06:47.788 --> 06:48.940
All right.

06:50.290 --> 06:51.412

You stick here, little man.

08:38.970 --> 08:40.760
- Jason's chain.
- Yeah.

08:40.863 --> 08:42.263
This is outside the corner store?

08:42.365 --> 08:44.111
- Mm-hmm.
- Go on.

08:48.803 --> 08:50.017
<i> We argue.</i>

08:53.286 --> 08:55.453

09:05.491 --> 09:06.784
I need to hear you say it.

09:17.065 --> 09:18.593
I shot him.

09:20.075 --> 09:21.346
That was it.

09:23.837 --> 09:25.880
<i> You remove anything from the body?</i>

09:27.442 --> 09:29.659
Just my boy's chain.

09:32.958 --> 09:35.081
It was the last thing that I gave him.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.415
<i> Okay.</i>

09:38.472 --> 09:39.942

- No.
- And the gun?

09:45.312 --> 09:46.278
Sold it.

09:46.710 --> 09:48.003
Who'd you sell the gun to?

09:48.300 --> 09:49.828

I don't know.

10:01.013 --> 10:02.546
You're lying about the gun.

10:06.446 --> 10:08.237

- Yeah.

14:51.405 --> 14:53.357
Why would he do that?

14:56.376 --> 14:57.994
I don't know. He felt guilty.

14:58.445 --> 15:01.229
Did he leave out the part where
you gave him Coogie Johnson?

15:03.017 --> 15:04.031
Ah...

15:05.884 --> 15:07.713
Oh, you wanna pull down on me?

16:31.269 --> 16:32.569
Cell phones too.

16:32.671 --> 16:34.140
I-I don't wanna know that.

16:34.439 --> 16:35.381
Okay.

16:37.776 --> 16:38.975
You okay?

16:39.311 --> 16:42.684
Just... nervous about the play.

16:43.949 --> 16:45.348
My whole family's coming.

16:45.450 --> 16:47.600
Don't worry. I got your back.

16:48.530 --> 16:51.401
Maybe we could run the lines together?

16:51.623 --> 16:53.434
All right, let's do it.

16:53.684 --> 16:55.992
We're gonna lock this Wiz down and shine.

16:58.598 --> 17:01.200
Check this, got the
Cold Duck all chilled up.

17:01.651 --> 17:02.992
Rosé, too.

17:04.486 --> 17:05.952
We ain't sold it yet, crazy.

17:06.053 --> 17:07.734
Shit, we got the offer, Laverne.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.474
It was the paint, wasn't it?

17:09.876 --> 17:11.309
Motherfuckin' Quaking Grass.

17:13.674 --> 17:16.137
- They didn't say.
- Laid that rest, did you?

17:17.478 --> 17:19.538
So what's the offer for?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.526
It's 5,000 over your asking price.

17:23.429 --> 17:25.963
- That's good, isn't it?
- In this market? Yes.

17:26.065 --> 17:27.565
Told you we shoulda asked for more.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.590
- We?
- You think that Italian tile

17:29.615 --> 17:30.701
just laid itself?

17:30.726 --> 17:32.058
Hell no. I got some

17:32.083 --> 17:33.428
serious sweat equity in this joint.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.705
Can we sign, please?

17:34.807 --> 17:36.106
We ain't fuckin' signing

17:36.131 --> 17:37.953
with no cheap ass Bics.

17:38.287 --> 17:39.807
This used to be my father's.

17:39.807 --> 17:41.540
- Look who bougie now.
- Now, now!

17:42.677 --> 17:43.776
I thought it was me.

17:43.878 --> 17:45.277
Let me take this real quick.

17:45.379 --> 17:46.946
- Hello?
- All right so,

17:47.559 --> 17:49.033

Everywhere it says seller initial.

17:50.985 --> 17:52.245

Everywhere you see the X.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.059
Uh, yeah, I'll let her
know. I'll let her know.

18:04.058 --> 18:05.465
No, that's it. Thank you.

18:06.244 --> 18:07.496
I appreciate it.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.458
All right, you too.

18:10.003 --> 18:12.470
I hope you see everything.
I'm sure he'll read it all.

18:13.681 --> 18:16.157
That was Detective Cruz. He, um...

18:17.177 --> 18:19.277
He said they got the guy who shot Coogie.

18:35.395 --> 18:36.729
Yo... Mom.

18:40.733 --> 18:41.903
I'm sorry.

18:44.036 --> 18:45.869
They helped... Fuck.

19:05.567 --> 19:07.100
See how I got my shit tucked?

19:07.125 --> 19:08.642
Tuck your shit in the back, just like that.

19:11.370 --> 19:12.429
Ready?

19:12.531 --> 19:13.841
- Yeah.
- Come on.

19:21.272 --> 19:22.300
Fellas.

19:25.085 --> 19:26.661
So listen up.

Trice gone.

19:30.638 --> 19:32.037
Man, what the fuck is you talkin' about?

19:32.139 --> 19:33.339
Big Mike, you heard exactly

19:33.441 --> 19:35.050

19:35.443 --> 19:37.529
That nigga gone, and he ain't comin' back.

19:44.696 --> 19:46.236
So what's up, then?

19:47.321 --> 19:49.288
So you the boss now, huh?

19:49.390 --> 19:51.304
That's the way it's lookin'.

19:57.437 --> 20:00.558
I wanna know, my paper the same?

20:08.341 --> 20:09.686
Hell yeah.

20:10.765 --> 20:13.333
Well, you just made the
boogey man smile, then.

20:13.435 --> 20:16.268

20:18.206 --> 20:20.866
Ha, but yeah, check it out, check it out.

So, look, hey, this block is
too motherfuckin' hot right now.

20:26.013 --> 20:28.147
We have to find us a new hustle, ASAP.

20:28.249 --> 20:29.849
Well, you need to come up
with some new moves, then,

20:29.951 --> 20:31.914

- Indeed. So look, check it out.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.496

low for a little minute,

20:35.356 --> 20:36.836
bust a couple syrups.

20:37.131 --> 20:39.035
As soon as I got somethin' new,

20:39.272 --> 20:40.635
I'm gon' hit you.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.823

20:45.997 --> 20:47.997
All right, y'all. I'ma holla at you.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.116
What's up, man? No pressure, no pressure.

20:56.673 --> 20:59.555
So what's up, uh... What you wanna do now?

20:59.580 --> 21:00.923
Wanna go get some new kicks?

21:01.375 --> 21:03.004
We can go to That's A Burger.

21:04.041 --> 21:06.425
- Nah, I'm not hungry.
- Yeah?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.032
So what else you wanna do?

21:20.462 --> 21:23.381
I gotta admit it, Andrea's doing all right.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.513
Saved it all for show time.

21:29.297 --> 21:31.463
You threw all that shade for no reason.

21:31.488 --> 21:32.821
Huh, whatever.

21:38.158 --> 21:41.260
See? Damn, girl. Mind the trees.

21:43.645 --> 21:46.012
- Be happy she dumped you.
- She didn't dump me, all right?

21:46.037 --> 21:47.060
All right.

21:47.085 --> 21:49.237
You're friends with a girl
that can't dance for shit.

21:49.416 --> 21:50.582
Whatever.

21:51.674 --> 21:53.307
All right, it's show time.

21:53.409 --> 21:54.542
You ready?

21:54.644 --> 21:56.144
I think so.

21:56.293 --> 21:58.966
Just remember, follow my lead.

21:58.991 --> 21:59.999
Ah!

22:39.054 --> 22:40.619
Hell yeah, Papa. Kill that shit, big boy.

22:40.722 --> 22:42.720
That's how you move, big boy!

23:39.445 --> 23:40.945
Good job, Kevin!

23:43.916 --> 23:45.774
Go, Kevin!

23:46.518 --> 23:48.819
We love you, Kevin! Whoo!

23:48.921 --> 23:50.554
Yes, go, Kevin!

23:55.594 --> 23:57.361
Kevin, Kevin! Kev...

24:04.536 --> 24:05.902
You just jealous.

24:08.274 --> 24:09.339
I see him looking at you.

24:11.377 --> 24:14.077
- Girl, don't be stupid.
- He got a pretty smile.

24:14.179 --> 24:16.746
What's up?

24:17.774 --> 24:19.332
Yo, Emmett.

24:20.052 --> 24:21.184
Come here.

24:27.455 --> 24:29.207
The hell is wrong with you, boy?

24:29.277 --> 24:31.410
Those ladies out there
shootin' hard at you,

24:31.512 --> 24:34.881
and you mopin' around
like your dog just died.

24:35.877 --> 24:37.792
Still got some shit on my mind.

24:38.834 --> 24:40.761
What's got you so twisted up?

24:41.751 --> 24:42.889
It's Tiffany, I...

24:42.914 --> 24:44.998
Boy, you need to find new tune to whistle.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.714
When she came to pick EJ up,

24:47.739 --> 24:49.219
she had a bruise on her cheek.

24:49.663 --> 24:50.869
Uh-huh.

24:54.709 --> 24:56.574
I can't have my son around that.

24:57.044 --> 24:58.847
No, you can't.

25:04.384 --> 25:05.717
Okay, just a few more, Kevin.

25:05.819 --> 25:07.118
- Just a few more. Stay there.
- Mom.

25:07.220 --> 25:08.571
Oh, come on. Hush yourself.

25:08.596 --> 25:10.757
Wait. There it is.

25:11.091 --> 25:12.282
Stay, don't move.

25:12.703 --> 25:14.102
Oh, that's so cute.

25:14.127 --> 25:15.351
Hey, come on.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.261
All right, last one. I'm hungry.

25:17.363 --> 25:19.274
- Let's go.
- Come on, smile, Kevin.

25:21.122 --> 25:22.577
By the way, Keisha,

25:22.602 --> 25:24.600
you look exceptionally beautiful today.

25:24.971 --> 25:26.733
- Thank you, Papa.
- Mm-hmm.

25:27.307 --> 25:29.073
- What are you doing?
- Come on, what are you doing?

25:29.175 --> 25:30.841
Oh, hey, hey, call me when
you're ready to come home

25:30.866 --> 25:31.986
and I'll come and pick you up.

25:32.011 --> 25:33.048
All right.

25:33.346 --> 25:34.445
Never hit on my sister like that.

25:34.547 --> 25:36.000
- She was lookin' good.
- Shut up.

25:36.025 --> 25:37.081
Keisha!

25:37.182 --> 25:39.282
- Ooh. Girl.
- You was walking around.

25:39.384 --> 25:40.684
You said take a picture, I took a picture.

25:40.709 --> 25:41.797
You just fightin'.

25:46.982 --> 25:48.135
Hey man, what were you doin'?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.380
Keisha was feelin' me.

25:49.405 --> 25:50.504
My sister?

25:50.529 --> 25:52.295
Hey, man. What can I say?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.487
When you got mad skills,
all the ladies in the house

25:54.512 --> 25:56.533
- want some of that.
- I thought Jesus was about

25:56.558 --> 25:58.234
being humble and thankful.

25:58.524 --> 26:00.391
- Do I look like Jesus to you?
- No, but you're always

26:00.493 --> 26:02.898
- bringing him up and shit.
- I aspire.

26:02.923 --> 26:04.256
And don't curse when you say His name.

26:04.358 --> 26:05.557
All I said was "shit."

26:07.761 --> 26:09.160
- What are you doing?
- I'm not getting hit

26:09.262 --> 26:10.561
by Jesus' lightning 'cause of you.

26:10.663 --> 26:12.030
We're inside, dummy.

26:12.132 --> 26:13.832
And Jesus is the son of God

26:13.934 --> 26:15.800
and can strike down
lightning wherever He wants.

26:15.902 --> 26:17.299
Jesus don't play.

26:17.437 --> 26:19.437
- What's up, fools?
- Jake.

26:19.462 --> 26:21.049
Came to bust our balls?

26:21.074 --> 26:22.673
Nah, man. Y'all were great.

26:22.776 --> 26:25.331
So, uh, you comin' back to the school?

26:26.613 --> 26:28.172
I don't know.

26:28.172 --> 26:29.807
What you gonna do?

26:30.275 --> 26:32.208
I guess see what's what.

26:32.559 --> 26:34.859
Look, man, you could always
stay with me if you want to.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.594
- Now why would I do that?
- I don't know.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.630
Maybe if you wanna run
away from your brother?

26:38.731 --> 26:40.198
- He's my blood, Kevin.
- All right.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.532
If you get in trouble, that's on you.

26:41.557 --> 26:42.659
Man, fuck you.

26:44.548 --> 26:46.186
Hey, Jake, hold up.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.571
I made this for you.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.339
It's rosewood.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.146
All right, thanks.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.757
You wanna hang, hit my line.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.599
Kev's just worried about you.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.845
Ain't none of his business to worry about.

27:11.564 --> 27:13.805
- I'll check you later.
- All right.

27:17.045 --> 27:19.783
- You tried.
- Hope he all right.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.405
Ain't nothing we can do
now but go to this party

27:22.430 --> 27:23.953
and bust it out.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.159
Thank you.

27:31.915 --> 27:34.523
Sheriff, please bring in Ronald Davis.

27:51.168 --> 27:52.535
Look at the judge.

27:54.098 --> 27:55.343
What are the charges?

27:55.383 --> 27:56.549
First degree murder for the killing

27:56.652 --> 27:58.985
of Charles "Coogie" Johnson.

28:00.507 --> 28:02.208
This motherfucker better not get no bail.

28:02.309 --> 28:03.908
- Shh.
- Don't be shushin' me.

28:04.010 --> 28:05.310
- That's my...
- Not in my court, ma'am.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.545
Please be quiet.

28:07.748 --> 28:09.648
- Ms. Sabloff?
- Ronald Garvey Davis

28:09.750 --> 28:12.050
- is a military veteran.
- Employment?

28:12.152 --> 28:13.485

he's worked in construction

28:14.722 --> 28:16.108
and as a stock clerk.

28:19.960 --> 28:22.193
No bond. Suspect is remanded

28:22.218 --> 28:24.469
to Cook County Jail, pending trial date.

28:30.323 --> 28:31.336
Thank you.

28:40.669 --> 28:42.044
Get out of my fuckin' face!

28:52.691 --> 28:54.424
<i>Stay the fuck away from me.</i>

28:54.526 --> 28:55.716
<i>Stay over there.</i>

28:57.562 --> 28:59.524
Yo, Tiffany. Tiffany!

29:00.031 --> 29:01.464

29:04.903 --> 29:06.636
Ohh, shit! Fuck.

29:33.497 --> 29:36.365
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, man, it's okay.

29:36.467 --> 29:38.033
It's okay. Wait up, wait up, wait up.

29:38.135 --> 29:40.369

- No, fuck you. Fuck you!

29:40.471 --> 29:42.003
Oh, shit! Tiff, Tiff, Tiff, Tiff.

29:45.142 --> 29:46.474
Stop, stop, stop, yo.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.515
The fuck is you doin' here, Emmett?

29:48.618 --> 29:50.585
I was worried. I thought
you might need some help.

29:50.687 --> 29:52.312
Do I look like I fuckin' need help, Emmett?

29:52.722 --> 29:54.869
- No, but I was tryin'...
- But what?

29:54.869 --> 29:56.869
I told your ass, stay
out my fuckin' business.

29:57.248 --> 29:58.814
Yeah, nigga, step the fuck off!

29:58.916 --> 30:01.226
- You shut the fuck up!

30:13.142 --> 30:14.775
- Emmett, wait!
- Hey, chill out, man.

30:14.877 --> 30:16.210
- Wait! Don't fuckin' touch me!

- Don't fuckin' touch me.

30:17.547 --> 30:18.946
- Hey...
- Come on.

30:19.048 --> 30:20.480
Emmett, wait! Emmett, where the fuck

30:20.582 --> 30:22.115
are you going with my kid?

30:22.218 --> 30:24.110
Man, look... relax! Fuckin' chill.

30:40.402 --> 30:41.868
Fuck you lookin' at?

30:46.408 --> 30:48.091
That's what the fuck I thought.

31:22.276 --> 31:23.542
Next, come on through.

31:26.947 --> 31:28.206
You plugged?

31:28.783 --> 31:29.824
What?

31:29.849 --> 31:31.029
With anybody?

31:32.096 --> 31:33.495
- No, man.
- Get to the back

31:33.520 --> 31:35.062
of the fuckin' line, then, neutron.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.441
Hey! Back up!

32:03.872 --> 32:06.739
Ahh, Detective Wallace.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.366
Please, let's have a drink.

32:17.329 --> 32:18.459
You got it.

32:20.298 --> 32:21.631
Now, what the fuck happened to you?

32:21.733 --> 32:24.025
- Yeah, wife.
- Ah.

32:24.636 --> 32:26.869
I had one like that.

32:28.778 --> 32:29.931
To Trice.

32:33.578 --> 32:34.760
Mm.

32:35.546 --> 32:37.782
And the less you know
about that, the better.

32:38.216 --> 32:40.416
Right. Fuck him.

32:43.554 --> 32:44.745
Fuck him.

32:51.272 --> 32:52.638
What's so fuckin' funny?

32:52.663 --> 32:54.807
Well, that's exactly
what he said about you.

32:55.510 --> 32:56.622
"Fuck him."

32:58.432 --> 33:01.596
Right before he told me

33:01.772 --> 33:03.695
the rest of the story.

33:04.341 --> 33:05.811
What the fuck you talkin' about?

33:42.278 --> 33:44.220
What the fuck was he doing?

33:45.281 --> 33:46.557
I don't know. He said he was trying

33:46.582 --> 33:48.606
to get home to his lady.

33:49.385 --> 33:51.419
Get the fuck out of here. I got it.

34:01.305 --> 34:02.361
Help.

34:43.514 --> 34:45.353
- That's some bullshit.
- No.

34:46.306 --> 34:48.340
No, Trice was telling the truth.

34:50.578 --> 34:51.801
Trust me.

34:54.781 --> 34:56.862
You know, and the bitch of this is

34:57.440 --> 35:00.263
is that I left here so
that my boy would be safe.

35:01.127 --> 35:03.395
Didn't want my shit spilling over on him.

35:08.262 --> 35:09.615
He was a good boy.

35:10.596 --> 35:12.968
Was gonna go to school, play ball.

35:14.368 --> 35:16.368
- But now...
- It was Trice, not me.

35:16.470 --> 35:18.468
- He shot your boy.
- Aha.

35:21.208 --> 35:22.726
Ah! Fuck!

35:23.577 --> 35:24.609
Uh!

35:53.973 --> 35:54.929
Hey.

35:56.409 --> 35:57.599
How is she?

35:57.792 --> 36:00.389
Coogie's room. In a mood.

36:30.655 --> 36:33.951
I saw the way that man looked
at you in the courtroom today.

36:38.124 --> 36:39.789
You knew him, didn't you?

36:42.287 --> 36:44.298
- Ma, I...
- Don't lie to me, boy.

36:46.590 --> 36:47.856
I just know him from around.

36:48.169 --> 36:49.526
Brandon, please.

36:49.551 --> 36:51.451
I saw... remember that
night you came up in here,

36:51.476 --> 36:53.143
talkin' 'bout you got hurt at work.

36:55.508 --> 36:58.141
Ma, I didn't go lookin' for him
if that's what you askin' me.

36:58.166 --> 37:01.134
- I didn't do that.
- I'm not askin' you nothin'.

37:02.889 --> 37:04.822
I'm just glad nothing happened, baby.

37:06.973 --> 37:08.872
And nothing's gonna happen, Mom.

37:11.607 --> 37:13.607
Hey, don't cry. Look, after we...

37:13.632 --> 37:15.141
After we sell this house,

37:15.141 --> 37:18.009
it's... we can just put all this behind us.

37:18.448 --> 37:19.480
All right?

37:19.582 --> 37:20.572
Uh-uh.

37:24.621 --> 37:26.464
I can't sell, baby.

37:30.115 --> 37:31.285
What?

37:32.595 --> 37:34.562
I can't sell, baby.

37:36.499 --> 37:38.021
I gotta stay.

37:40.169 --> 37:42.637
I gotta go through this
trial and see this man

37:42.739 --> 37:44.839
pay for what he done to my baby.

37:47.076 --> 37:49.194
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.416
We'll be all right.

38:04.526 --> 38:05.826
Who is it?

38:05.927 --> 38:08.094
<i>Detective Cruz, CPD.</i>

38:08.273 --> 38:09.563
How can I help you?

38:10.432 --> 38:13.567
<i>I need to speak with a parent
or parents of Kevin Williams.</i>

38:15.237 --> 38:17.436
Kevin's my son. What's
happening? What's going on?

38:17.538 --> 38:19.072
I'm sorry to bother
you this evening, ma'am,

38:19.174 --> 38:21.241
but, uh, I need to question your son.

38:21.343 --> 38:22.662
About what?

38:23.177 --> 38:25.429
The murder of Charles "Coogie" Johnson.

38:26.747 --> 38:27.980
- Uh...
- Killer claims that

38:28.082 --> 38:29.748
your son saw him commit the crime.

38:32.040 --> 38:33.406
If Kevin saw something like that,

38:33.431 --> 38:34.529
he would've told me about it.

38:34.554 --> 38:35.653
And he didn't, so I'm sorry

38:35.678 --> 38:37.044
we can't help you.

38:37.224 --> 38:39.174
Coogie Johnson was 16 years old.

38:41.569 --> 38:42.716
I need your help.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.288
Ah...

39:24.713 --> 39:26.680
It's all taken care of.

39:33.983 --> 39:37.567
He was just at the wrong
place at the wrong time, Tracy.

39:38.774 --> 39:40.094
That's all.

39:46.758 --> 39:47.970
I'm sorry.

40:51.677 --> 40:53.243
Hey, you got a cellmate.

40:53.268 --> 40:54.341
Right.

41:35.697 --> 41:37.441
You good with this?

41:38.667 --> 41:39.799
Yeah.

41:40.591 --> 41:42.939
Good. 'Cause it's your case, now.

41:57.976 --> 42:00.053
Tiff freakin' out that I took EJ.

42:00.153 --> 42:02.087
She said she gon' call the cops on me.

42:02.454 --> 42:04.658
Baby, you did the right thing.

42:05.258 --> 42:07.164
How am I supposed to protect him next time?

42:10.198 --> 42:11.893
You gon' have to get custody.

42:12.432 --> 42:14.399
Well, Sonny told me that
wasn't gonna be easy.

42:14.501 --> 42:16.634
Yeah, it's damn near impossible.

42:19.498 --> 42:21.155
I don't know how I'm gonna do this one.

42:22.775 --> 42:24.207
You'll figure it out.

43:03.315 --> 43:05.649
Hey, taco. Remember me?

43:06.722 --> 43:08.028
You showed up at the crib, talkin' 'bout

43:08.053 --> 43:10.086
you fucked up and lost my pole.

43:14.059 --> 43:15.291
Yeah, I remember.

43:16.828 --> 43:18.153
I'm here to collect.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.863
Look, if you want money, dog, I could...

43:19.888 --> 43:21.320
Ah hell no. Don't trip on none of that.

43:21.345 --> 43:23.261
We gon' make a whole lot of money.

43:23.734 --> 43:25.844
Yeah, we goin' fuckin' mobile.

43:29.054 --> 43:30.153
Nice truck.

43:35.547 --> 43:37.161
Big Mike, we gone.

43:41.852 --> 43:42.968
Hey, um...

43:44.454 --> 43:45.821
I'ma holla at you.

44:36.905 --> 44:39.139
Man, what's up with you not dancing?

44:39.242 --> 44:40.807
I gotta go handle something.

44:40.909 --> 44:42.142
You need backup?

44:42.245 --> 44:44.711
- No, I got it.
- Oh, no.

44:46.115 --> 44:47.781
Man, what do you want?

44:47.883 --> 44:49.482
'Cause I know you don't wanna
dance with someone like me.

44:49.584 --> 44:51.451
Look, I messed up, all right?

44:51.553 --> 44:53.553
- Yeah, you did.
- I just got caught up

44:53.578 --> 44:54.932
with the whole Andrea thing

44:54.957 --> 44:56.314
and I forgot about your feelings.

44:56.691 --> 44:57.835
You were disrespectful, man.

44:57.860 --> 44:59.425
I know, and I'm sorry.

44:59.527 --> 45:01.668
I-I just didn't want
to hurt your feelings.

45:01.996 --> 45:03.596
Can you please forgive me?

45:06.635 --> 45:08.368
Okay. I forgive you.

45:08.470 --> 45:09.835
- For real?
- Yeah.

45:09.937 --> 45:11.304
It's the Christian thing to do.

45:11.406 --> 45:14.828
Besides, I don't even like you anymore.

45:15.711 --> 45:16.787
Okay.

45:16.811 --> 45:18.510
Can you put in a word for me with Papa?

45:18.721 --> 45:19.821
Really?

45:21.849 --> 45:24.467
Yeah. I like the way he moves.

45:25.352 --> 45:27.096
- All right.
- Ask him if he wants

45:27.129 --> 45:28.344
to come dance with me.

45:29.991 --> 45:31.490
Okay.

45:33.352 --> 45:35.912
- Hey, uh, Papa, uh...
- No, no, no, no.

45:42.531 --> 45:43.579
Hey.

45:46.588 --> 45:47.687
You were great.

45:49.810 --> 45:50.875
You too.

45:53.213 --> 45:54.578
You wanna dance?

45:57.117 --> 45:58.795
But I thought...

45:59.286 --> 46:01.007
It's just dancing.

46:01.658 --> 46:02.818
Come on.
