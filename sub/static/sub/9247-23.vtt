WEBVTT

00:01.914 --> 00:03.742
Dwight, where's that truck?

00:03.829 --> 00:05.831
You were supposed to have those
ostriches here two days ago

00:05.918 --> 00:07.355
you cud-chewing hayseed.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.401
Don't make him mad,
he's got our money.

00:10.488 --> 00:14.057
Relax! I'm the godfather
to his oldest girl.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.754
Listen, you inbred halfwit.

00:17.495 --> 00:20.150
Get those birds to Chicago
and quit bumping ugly

00:20.237 --> 00:23.197
with every truck stop troll
that flashes her tooth at you.

00:25.155 --> 00:26.983
I got a bad feeling about this.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.506
Alright, if I don't see you
in a day and a half

00:28.593 --> 00:30.987
I'm gonna hunt you down,
you shoeless rube.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.336
God bless, drive safe.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.948
So, what did he say?
Are the ostriches okay?

00:36.036 --> 00:37.602
They're a little homesick.

00:37.689 --> 00:41.302
It's a big move for them,
changing schools and all.

00:41.389 --> 00:42.651
What, are you kidding me,
they're dumb animals

00:42.738 --> 00:44.696
you dumb animal.

00:44.783 --> 00:45.741
You're right, I'm an idiot.

00:45.828 --> 00:46.785
I don't know what I was thinking

00:46.872 --> 00:48.048
going into business with you.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.136
I don't know, honestly

00:49.223 --> 00:51.399
I was a little surprised myself.

00:51.486 --> 00:53.270
- Morning.
- Hey.

00:53.357 --> 00:55.751
- How do?
- Hey.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.318
Okay. A little weird in here.

00:57.405 --> 00:58.797
You guys weren't kissing,
were you?

01:00.495 --> 01:01.887
No, we weren't kissing.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.367
We-we're not doing anything
together.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.369
- Nothing at all.
- Yeah, I was kidding.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.067
[both laughing]

01:07.154 --> 01:08.894
Oh lady, you are a hoot.

01:10.592 --> 01:13.029
Not-not that I haven't been
tempted a couple of times.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.944
You bagged a real looker here.

01:15.031 --> 01:16.337
Like a portly Paul Newman.

01:18.817 --> 01:20.863
Seriously, I saw
the bottle of salad dressing

01:20.950 --> 01:22.299
in the fridge the other day.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.693
I thought it was you,
hiding behind the mustard.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.434
It's the blue eyes.
It's the blue eyes.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.482
[both laughing]

01:34.964 --> 01:36.618
Uh.

01:36.705 --> 01:37.923
What's the matter with you?

01:38.010 --> 01:39.969
I was trying
to defuse the situation.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.840
You just stood there
like an idiot.

01:41.927 --> 01:44.452
What did you want me to do,
actually kiss you?

01:44.539 --> 01:46.976
I don't think I'd let you,
with that tone of voice.

01:48.369 --> 01:50.240
♪ For the first time ♪

01:50.327 --> 01:53.765
♪ In my life ♪

01:53.852 --> 01:56.725
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:09.303 --> 02:12.001
- Captain, you wanted to see me?
- Come in, Biggs.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.264
A little dark in here,
isn't it, sir?

02:14.351 --> 02:16.701
Not as dark as the black hole
your mother left

02:16.788 --> 02:18.486
when she ripped out my heart.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.357
Oh boy.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.534
Is my favorite couple going

02:23.621 --> 02:25.536
through a bit of a rough patch?

02:25.623 --> 02:28.235
She handed me
my walking papers last night.

02:28.322 --> 02:29.627
No ifs, ands or whys.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.587
Just take your mustache wax
and go.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.764
She does that, sir.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.635
I can't tell you how many
times she's gotten mad

02:37.722 --> 02:39.376
and disowned me
or told me I was adopted.

02:39.463 --> 02:42.249
After a while,
you just stop hearing it.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.989
I just don't get it.

02:44.076 --> 02:45.339
We were having
a lovely evening.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.818
I cooked dinner

02:46.905 --> 02:49.604
loaded the dishwasher.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.258
I pumiced her bunion
while we watched

02:51.345 --> 02:52.955
"The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance."

02:55.523 --> 02:56.828
She does love the Duke.

02:58.526 --> 03:01.050
One of the many things
we had in common.

03:01.137 --> 03:04.358
That, country line dancing.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.533
Soft pretzels.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.406
I was sugar and cinnamon
and she was..

03:10.973 --> 03:12.235
...jalapeno and extra salt.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.586
Thank you.

03:15.673 --> 03:17.371
I-I'm sure everything
will be fine.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.460
Just give it some time.
It'll work itself out.

03:19.547 --> 03:21.070
Has she mentioned
anything to you

03:21.157 --> 03:23.203
about being unhappy
with our relationship?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.509
Oh no, mom doesn't ask
about my feelings

03:25.596 --> 03:26.554
and I don't ask about hers.

03:26.641 --> 03:27.598
It's kind of a deal we made

03:27.685 --> 03:28.599
when I was five.

03:31.123 --> 03:34.562
I guess I'm just gonna
have to walk through the fire..

03:34.649 --> 03:36.303
...strap on my six-guns

03:36.390 --> 03:38.740
and put one boot
in front of the other.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.220
That's the cowboy spirit
the Duke

03:40.307 --> 03:41.612
would be proud of.
Happy trails, sir.

03:42.570 --> 03:44.441
Biggs!

03:44.528 --> 03:46.138
You'll let me know
if your mother tells you

03:46.226 --> 03:48.880
why she tossed me out
the window like an old beer can.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.579
Does she still do that?
I got her a recycling bin.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.714
- Promise me.
- Of course, sir.

03:56.801 --> 03:59.282
And I'm assuming you being
on the outs with my mother

03:59.369 --> 04:02.067
won't affect
our working relationship.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.939
- I'd like to think it won't.
- Great.

04:04.026 --> 04:07.072
Unfortunately, I am
a spiteful and vengeful man.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.947
And this bucket of hurt

04:12.034 --> 04:14.123
has to drop on somebody's head.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.562
Somebody...meaning me?

04:18.649 --> 04:20.129
Just serving it
to you straight, Biggs.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.218
I'm as honest as I am vengeful.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.135
You're not gonna fire me,
are you?

04:26.222 --> 04:28.180
No.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.793
I can't fire you, that would
be completely unethical.

04:33.447 --> 04:36.188
What I can do
is go medieval on your ass.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.453
[instrumental music]

04:43.935 --> 04:46.677
Oh, I thought the whole medieval
thing was just an expression.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.638
I signed up
to protect and serve

04:50.725 --> 04:53.293
not guard crappers
at a Renaissance Faire.

04:53.380 --> 04:54.468
Remember, the head
of the festival

04:54.555 --> 04:55.512
says we are supposed to refer

04:55.599 --> 04:57.253
to them as Ye Olde Privies.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.341
I'm not living in their times.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.169
I'll call them whatever I want.

05:00.256 --> 05:02.084
A bunch of bell-wearing dorks.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.781
Greeting constables.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.522
After gorging on mutton and mead

05:05.609 --> 05:08.264
I find myself
in dire need of a privy.

05:08.351 --> 05:10.005
Follow your nose, Friar Tuck.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.877
Ah, t'ward a viper,
t'ward a biffy.

05:12.964 --> 05:14.357
I bid you anon.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.145
Hope he pees all over
his curly shoes.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.669
Hey, you got to talk
to your mom, man.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.627
I can't take three days
of this freak show.

05:23.714 --> 05:26.021
Look, just suck it up
till this thing blows over.

05:26.108 --> 05:27.718
What, that could take
until the 1500s

05:27.805 --> 05:30.068
and we may be dead
from the plague by then.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.201
Well, I'm not getting involved
in my mom's personal life

05:32.288 --> 05:34.029
so you'll just have to find
the bright side.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.509
Look, the bright side will be
sitting on that

05:35.596 --> 05:37.032
homemade catapult,
cutting the rope

05:37.119 --> 05:38.250
and flying the hell
out of here.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.384
Huzzah, noble peacekeepers!

05:41.471 --> 05:42.994
I give ye

05:43.081 --> 05:45.432
six guesses
to these riddles three.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.695
I'm gonna give ye
two seconds to walk away

05:47.782 --> 05:49.261
or I'm gonna handcuff
your jingly ass

05:49.349 --> 05:50.872
to one of those poop barns.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.264
Sorry officer, have a super day.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.095
The real riddle
is how I'm gonna go three days

05:57.182 --> 05:58.314
without shooting one
of these silly-ass

05:58.401 --> 06:00.838
knights of the nerd table.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.101
It is true
what they say about mead.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.930
One only rents it.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.106
You might wanna check your fly,
Sir Don't-Get-Laid-a-Lot.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.548
Whatever the hell that thing is,
I ain't scooping up after it.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.686
Oh, hey, Peggy, good job
on the pizza boats today.

06:22.773 --> 06:24.993
[speaking in foreign language]

06:25.080 --> 06:27.169
Hey, I know they're delicious
or I wouldn't serve them.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.213
Alright.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.826
Give this to the boy
to give to Paddy.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.523
- What is it?
- Deodorant stick.

06:33.610 --> 06:35.873
Nose hair trimmer,
a Bob Cousy biography

06:35.960 --> 06:37.658
and a diamond engagement ring.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.573
- You finally had enough, huh?
- How's that?

06:39.660 --> 06:41.792
I said, oh, my God,
what happened?

06:43.359 --> 06:45.796
It's over.
I'll miss his company, though.

06:45.883 --> 06:48.538
He doted on me
like I was the Queen of Sheba.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.932
I never had to pull out
a chair or open a car door.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.108
Why am I holding a bag
with a deodorant stick

06:53.195 --> 06:54.631
and your engagement ring in it?

06:54.718 --> 06:56.503
Boy, you love digging
to the bottom

06:56.590 --> 06:58.505
of the litter box, don't you?

06:58.592 --> 07:00.507
Fine, you want the dirt?
I'll give you the dirt.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.770
No, no, no, I trust you.
What's done is done.

07:02.857 --> 07:04.598
I am a sexual being!

07:04.685 --> 07:07.514
Oh, God, here comes
that pizza burp.

07:07.601 --> 07:10.778
And I tried to fan the embers
of passion, Lord knows I tried.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.606
But you can't start
a fire with wet wood.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.521
[blows]
I am so swamped.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.001
I mean, Mikey's dad
and I hated each other's guts

07:17.088 --> 07:20.004
but we knew how to work out
the ugly on the bed springs.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.659
Oh, you know what, I left
my good red pen at home

07:22.746 --> 07:24.226
so I'm just probably gonna--

07:24.313 --> 07:25.923
It's not like
he couldn't perform

07:26.010 --> 07:27.534
but a gal doesn't always

07:27.621 --> 07:29.666
wanna be treated
like a delicate flower.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.015
None of my business!

07:31.102 --> 07:32.190
Sometimes you wanna be pulled up

07:32.277 --> 07:35.193
by the root like a nasty weed.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.195
Alright. Well, just hit
the lights on the way out.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.633
I thought by this age,
my carnal desires

07:39.720 --> 07:41.199
would have cooled, but instead

07:41.286 --> 07:43.898
they're bubbling over
like an untended oatmeal.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.682
I'm leaving, lock it,
don't lock it

07:45.769 --> 07:47.205
burn it down, I don't care.

07:49.773 --> 07:51.514
Dwight, how long
does it take to drive

07:51.601 --> 07:54.822
a truckload of ostriches
across four states?

07:54.909 --> 07:57.868
I could've ridden
them here by now.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.044
You know what, put one
of the birds on the phone.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.742
I'll have him get you here.

08:03.744 --> 08:06.573
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, he's running late.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.749
He stumbled across
a Truck Stop Shower

08:08.836 --> 08:10.185
that didn't need quarters.

08:10.272 --> 08:11.795
Finding free hot water is like

08:11.882 --> 08:13.580
striking oil to a hillbilly.

08:15.059 --> 08:16.800
Vince, this thing
really needs to work out.

08:16.887 --> 08:19.020
I'm on really
shaky ground at work.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.631
Hey, everywhere you are,
the ground is kinda shaky.

08:22.893 --> 08:25.505
I am not in a joking mood,
Moranto.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.507
I've been dealing
with crap all day.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.770
Human, horse and hobbit.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.468
What's going on?
Ooh, are you gonna hit him?

08:32.555 --> 08:35.689
No. Oh, no,
I just like this shirt.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.473
[chuckles]
I wanted to feel the material.

08:37.560 --> 08:40.302
- What is that, silk?
- It's a poly rayon blend.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.478
Comes out of the washer dry.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.788
Just let me know when that
shipment of shirts comes in.

08:47.875 --> 08:50.181
Good luck finding one
in your size.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.053
I'm a Korean XL.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.624
Alright, what is going on
with you and Vince?

08:57.711 --> 09:00.670
Nothing. What's going on
with you and all your questions?

09:00.757 --> 09:02.759
Maybe you should be asking
yourself that, huh?

09:02.846 --> 09:06.023
Fine, I hope you and Ding Dong
enjoy playing grab-ass

09:06.110 --> 09:08.112
'cause I got a bag
full of misery, for ya.

09:09.374 --> 09:10.375
What is it?

09:10.462 --> 09:11.376
Your mom wants you to give that

09:11.463 --> 09:12.856
to the captain.

09:12.943 --> 09:13.944
Aw, she's giving back

09:14.031 --> 09:15.076
the engagement ring?

09:15.163 --> 09:16.338
Did she say why?

09:16.425 --> 09:20.037
Yeah, she said why
and how and with what.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.695
Had to stop and buy Tums
on the way home.

09:27.697 --> 09:29.046
Do I wanna hear this?

09:29.133 --> 09:30.700
I can tell you or I can
show you on the Dell.

09:30.787 --> 09:31.745
Take your pick.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.361
Captain?

09:44.192 --> 09:45.585
[Patrick]
'What's in the bag, Biggs?'

09:48.196 --> 09:49.937
I know it's not leftovers.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.549
I didn't, I didn't
see you there, sir.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.159
Been here all night.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.118
Can't go home.

09:57.205 --> 09:59.250
Can't go anywhere without being

09:59.337 --> 10:02.166
haunted by the memories
of my darling Margaret.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.429
You know, you're still
a very vibrant man, uh

10:04.516 --> 10:06.388
you'll bounce back from this.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.042
When I love, I love deep.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.566
I can't just shake it off
like a bad cold.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.742
Oh, sweet Lord,
there's no halfway

10:12.829 --> 10:14.918
with that woman, is there?

10:15.005 --> 10:17.529
No, the piledriver's pretty
much her only move, sir.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.358
I don't know what went wrong.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.317
If I did, maybe I could fix it.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.319
Look, you'll make yourself nuts
trying to figure that out.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.103
Just try to move on

10:26.190 --> 10:27.888
and remember that
I had absolutely

10:27.975 --> 10:30.238
nothing to do with this.

10:30.325 --> 10:33.023
She didn't say
anything about why?

10:34.895 --> 10:36.418
May have been a little bit
of lady gab between

10:36.505 --> 10:38.289
her and my wife,
but nothing to me, sir.

10:38.376 --> 10:40.465
Biggs, if you're withholding
information from me

10:40.552 --> 10:42.990
I will put you on a detail
so ugly

10:43.077 --> 10:45.775
the Ren Faire crappers
will be your happy place.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.521
Listen, I warned you
from the beginning

10:52.608 --> 10:54.479
it wasn't a good idea
for you to date my mother.

10:54.566 --> 10:56.220
- Sit!
- Ah.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.582
Alright, this isn't
coming from me.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.932
This is possibly
one of the worst things

11:12.019 --> 11:13.368
I've ever had to say in my life.

11:13.455 --> 11:16.371
I'm a grown man, Biggs.
Give it to me straight.

11:16.458 --> 11:20.201
Sir, my mother
is very difficult to please.

11:20.288 --> 11:23.160
She heckled the priest
at her mother's funeral.

11:23.247 --> 11:25.946
- In Latin!
- Just tell me what I did wrong.

11:26.033 --> 11:27.251
I only ever tried
to be a perfect

11:27.338 --> 11:28.557
gentleman to your mother.

11:28.644 --> 11:29.732
Yeah, well apparently
she doesn't

11:29.819 --> 11:32.039
like that all the time.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.518
- Not following you.
- That's wise.

11:33.605 --> 11:34.606
'Cause I don't know
where I'm going.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.304
Biggs, for the love of God, quit

11:36.391 --> 11:38.610
tap dancing and spill the beans.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.440
What do you want from me?

11:42.527 --> 11:44.704
Pull her hair!
Spank her!

11:44.791 --> 11:46.140
Swing her around
the room like a rag doll!

11:46.227 --> 11:47.576
My mother's an animal.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.882
A dirty, filthy animal!

11:48.969 --> 11:50.535
I gotta go.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.320
[thunder rumbling]

11:52.407 --> 11:54.278
[instrumental music]

12:01.285 --> 12:02.896
'And the National
Weather Service'

12:02.983 --> 12:05.333
'has just issued a tornado watch
for the following counties.'

12:05.420 --> 12:07.770
'Cook, DuPage, Will'

12:07.857 --> 12:09.816
'Kankakee and Iroquois.'

12:09.903 --> 12:11.121
'Be advised to take shelter'

12:11.208 --> 12:13.645
'should these
conditions worsen.'

12:13.733 --> 12:16.039
Hope this blows through
before tomorrow night.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.998
It's the jousting finals
at the Renaissance Faire

12:18.085 --> 12:21.479
and my grand chamberlain's hat
does not have a chin strap.

12:21.566 --> 12:23.917
Should probably take some
candles down to the basement.

12:24.004 --> 12:25.179
We might lose power.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.484
Uh, you wanna avoid candles

12:26.571 --> 12:27.964
in case of a gas leak.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.574
I've got flashlights
in the trunk of my car

12:29.661 --> 12:31.359
plus a case of canned stew

12:31.446 --> 12:33.143
and 25 gallons
of distilled water.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.189
Well, you really prepared
for this storm, huh?

12:35.276 --> 12:37.365
No, I just came from Costco.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.583
It's my stew for the month.

12:44.720 --> 12:46.200
[grunts]
Son of a..

12:49.246 --> 12:51.292
Fine, have a nice life.

12:55.731 --> 12:57.037
It's pretty bad out there.

12:59.039 --> 13:01.128
We might wanna head
to the basement.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.260
Well, technically
it's just a tornado watch.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.522
It goes advisory, alert

13:04.609 --> 13:05.872
watch, warning, tornado.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.438
Okay, I'm gonna
be in the basement.

13:07.525 --> 13:09.136
You go look for my umbrella.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.617
Hear ye, hear ye

13:12.704 --> 13:15.490
please proceed to the basement
of King Arthur's Castle

13:15.577 --> 13:18.406
in an orderly fashion.

13:18.493 --> 13:20.103
Tell them it's a dragon attack.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.888
That'll get their medieval
asses moving.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.020
Do not tarry.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.935
Do not get in your cars.

13:26.022 --> 13:28.895
Don't try to be a hero.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.419
But you're not really Knights
of The Round Table.

13:31.506 --> 13:34.422
And you probably work
at Best Buy or Jamba Juice.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.471
Now that's funny.

13:41.908 --> 13:44.214
I should call Molly,
make sure she's okay.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.086
Hey, you don't have to,
I tried to call my grandma a few

13:46.173 --> 13:48.088
minutes ago,
but I can't get a signal.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.177
My guess is the cell towers
are down.

13:50.264 --> 13:51.787
No bars.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.093
I'm sure she's fine though

13:53.180 --> 13:55.269
inside like
you're supposed to be

13:55.356 --> 13:57.445
and not waiting for the
four o'clock puppet show.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.451
We don't have to chase
after that, do we?

14:03.538 --> 14:04.844
No no, we just guard them.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.541
Once they start
blowing around, you know

14:06.628 --> 14:08.630
that's Fire Department
or maybe Parks and Rec.

14:10.632 --> 14:14.201
I hope Mike's okay. A funnel
cloud touched down in Whiting.

14:14.288 --> 14:17.987
Figures. Tornadoes always use
trailer parks as appetizers.

14:18.074 --> 14:21.077
Remember, avoid this area
because of the windows.

14:21.164 --> 14:23.210
The change of pressure
could blow this glass

14:23.297 --> 14:25.299
and rip off your face
like an angry chimp.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.519
What's he doing here, anyway?

14:28.606 --> 14:30.434
Isn't there a ditch
he can go lie down in?

14:30.521 --> 14:32.088
Harry, just knock it off.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.611
You're making everybody nervous.

14:33.698 --> 14:36.179
You should be nervous.
Tornadoes are killers.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.747
Statistically speaking,
only three of us will survive.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.532
I'm chaining myself to you

14:41.619 --> 14:43.621
you're not going anywhere.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.754
We're gonna be fine.
Worst case scenario.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.974
The house blows away
and lands on Mike's mom.

14:49.584 --> 14:50.759
Oh, this is it.

14:50.846 --> 14:51.934
Everything is fine.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.675
Do not panic.

14:53.762 --> 14:55.459
[siren wails]

14:55.546 --> 14:57.113
Okay, panic.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.118
I can't get through.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.729
Man, we need to pull over.
This is bad.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.688
Just got passed by a tree.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.603
Just keep driving.
I've got to get home to Molly.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.821
I feel horrible.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.910
I can't believe I lied to her

15:10.997 --> 15:12.520
about the thing with Vince.

15:12.607 --> 15:13.738
You're right.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.958
Now is the time for truth.

15:16.045 --> 15:17.917
So I just want to say
you are the best friend

15:18.004 --> 15:19.222
and partner I've ever had.

15:19.309 --> 15:20.658
Thanks, buddy.

15:20.745 --> 15:22.008
You're not an easy man
to get along with

15:22.095 --> 15:23.705
you're pigheaded
and set in your ways

15:23.792 --> 15:25.794
and never admit
when you're wrong.

15:25.881 --> 15:28.318
And I still say Marisa Tormi
is Mel Tormi's daughter.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.365
That's Marisa Tomei,
they have different last names.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.932
Yeah, but maybe she changed it
so she wouldn't

15:33.019 --> 15:34.759
have to live
under his legendary shadow.

15:34.846 --> 15:37.762
You know, I'm starting to hope
these are your last words.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.590
But all that aside

15:39.677 --> 15:41.070
you've always been
like a brother to me.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.245
I love you very much.

15:42.332 --> 15:45.466
- Same here.
- That's it?

15:45.553 --> 15:46.815
I pour my heart out
and all you can say

15:46.902 --> 15:48.686
is "Same here?"

15:48.773 --> 15:50.297
You know if a twister
sucks me out of this car

15:50.384 --> 15:51.385
and you live, you're gonna
regret not telling me

15:51.472 --> 15:52.647
you love me.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.345
- Fine, I love you.
- Thank you.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.999
Now's not the time to hold back.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.351
When I was 14,
I showed my cousin my privates.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.095
You can stop right there, Carl.

16:06.182 --> 16:07.270
Same thing he said.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.798
Listen, Jim, if I get killed
by flying debris

16:13.885 --> 16:16.279
promise me
you'll eat me toes-first.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.586
That way I can still
have an open casket.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.110
[door bell rings]

16:21.197 --> 16:22.894
What kind
of mouth breathing moron

16:22.982 --> 16:25.332
is traipsing around
in this weather?

16:25.419 --> 16:28.596
Probably that hoarder neighbor
wanting to squat in my basement.

16:28.683 --> 16:30.859
Should have thought about this
when you started saving

16:30.946 --> 16:34.210
all those National Geographic's
and jars of urine.

16:35.777 --> 16:38.084
[Patrick]
'Open the door, Margaret.'

16:38.171 --> 16:39.955
Paddy?

16:45.787 --> 16:47.441
What are you doing here?

16:47.528 --> 16:48.485
We're done.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.446
Shut your yap, woman.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.448
We're done
when I say we're done.

16:57.581 --> 16:59.714
[dog barking]

16:59.801 --> 17:01.063
I wish Mike would get home.

17:01.150 --> 17:02.847
I can't believe
he's out in this.

17:02.934 --> 17:04.545
I can't believe you lit
all these candles.

17:04.632 --> 17:05.937
One gas leak and the house

17:06.025 --> 17:07.330
goes up like a bottle rocket.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.897
We're worried
about your gas leak

17:08.984 --> 17:09.941
stew butt.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.075
I'm not going
to apologize again.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.686
I'm nervous
and it was an accident.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.993
- 'Molly?'
- Mike?

17:18.080 --> 17:20.343
Oh, God, you guys are okay.

17:20.430 --> 17:21.779
Oh, my God,
I couldn't get through

17:21.866 --> 17:22.780
and I was thinking the worst.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.044
I'm so glad you're home.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.349
I have something to tell you.

17:26.436 --> 17:27.394
Hey, not the cousin thing,
right?

17:30.658 --> 17:32.138
I was trying to make
some extra money

17:32.225 --> 17:33.965
in case we have to do
the whole in vitro deal

17:34.053 --> 17:36.011
so I went into business
with Vince.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.274
- What?
- I was as shocked as you are.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.537
And ostriches no less.

17:40.624 --> 17:41.930
What-what is he talking about?

17:42.017 --> 17:43.671
I-I'm sorry I didn't
tell you about it.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.847
I just want us
to have a baby so bad.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.631
So you bought
a bunch of ostriches?

17:47.718 --> 17:49.503
Well, it sounds stupid
when you say it like that.

17:51.766 --> 17:52.854
[indistinct chattering]

17:54.986 --> 17:56.205
[Mike]
'I love you Molly Flynn.'

17:56.292 --> 17:58.381
[Molly]
'I love you Mike Biggs.'

17:58.468 --> 18:00.557
[Harry]
'I hope that's not the tree
my Vespa was chained to.'

18:00.644 --> 18:02.168
'If it is, I'm probably
gonna need a ride home.'

18:02.255 --> 18:04.039
[all]
Shut up, Harry!

18:08.652 --> 18:09.610
Are you sure you're okay, mom?

18:09.697 --> 18:11.220
You sound out of breath.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.615
What? Oh, God, why'd you even
pick up the phone?

18:16.573 --> 18:19.010
See, once you get it in your
head it doesn't go away.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.275
Wow, we didn't get
the worst of it.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.494
Look at all those jack-knifed
trucks on the freeway.

18:24.581 --> 18:27.280
They probably swerved
to miss all those ostriches.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.717
- What?
- 'Not so fast.'

18:29.804 --> 18:31.153
We don't know those are ours.

18:33.329 --> 18:36.289
That twister tossed me
around like a lotto ball.

18:36.376 --> 18:39.205
Flipped my truck over
and those birds went everywhere.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.729
I just thank God
I'm still alive.

18:41.816 --> 18:43.296
And single, ladies.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.083
Get a net and chase them down,
you stupid cracker.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.788
[theme music]
