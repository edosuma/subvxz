WEBVTT

00:07.575 --> 00:10.878
* Just a little boy lost
looking for a lamb *

00:10.978 --> 00:13.547
* In the all-night city

00:13.647 --> 00:18.986
* Living in
his lonely limousine *

00:19.087 --> 00:22.223
* And though
he never has to worry *

00:22.323 --> 00:25.226
* He's the only one
and only one *

00:25.326 --> 00:27.161
* He's ever gonna need

00:27.261 --> 00:30.631
* Absolutely,
he's in definite need *

00:30.731 --> 00:34.768
* Ooh, maybe we've been
alone too long *

00:34.868 --> 00:37.605
* You don't
want to be lonely *

00:37.705 --> 00:40.374
* Maybe we've been
alone too long *

00:40.474 --> 00:45.613
* You don't want
to be lonely. *

00:54.222 --> 00:56.790
Oh, Stuart,
get off me.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.991
What are you doing?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.893
( groans )
What's going on?

00:59.993 --> 01:03.297
Your head
was on my chest.
Gross.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.099
( sighs )
Yeah, well,
count your blessings

01:05.199 --> 01:06.200
'cause I normally
wake up with an erection,

01:06.300 --> 01:08.035
but you've
put an end to that.

01:08.136 --> 01:11.205
This is crazy.
You should be paying for me
to stay in a hotel.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.973
I'm not putting you
in a hotel.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.609
I'm already
paying for a new roof
for the guesthouse,

01:15.709 --> 01:16.810
which it doesn't need.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.015
Mike!

01:22.116 --> 01:23.584
D-boy!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.286
Lopez, you wankers!

01:25.386 --> 01:28.622
Where me homies at?
In the backyard.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.124
Do you need anything?

01:30.224 --> 01:32.726
- No, we're good.
Thank you!
- Nope.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.428
All right, boys.

01:38.065 --> 01:40.368
Jessica:
Stuart, why are you trying
to be friends with them?

01:40.468 --> 01:42.503
You have to.
Guys like this,
working-class dudes,

01:42.603 --> 01:45.539
if they smell that
you're not one of them,
they will fleece you.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.276
Really? And how exactly
do you win them over?

01:48.376 --> 01:50.244
Easy, just talk to them about
stuff that they relate to.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.181
You know, like cars,
you know, or shagging.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.415
Football, whatever.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.851
Name three
American football teams.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.254
( sighs )
Miami Dolphins,

02:00.354 --> 02:03.157
Chicago Bulls,
Detroit Tigers. Done.

02:03.257 --> 02:05.593
You just named
a football team,

02:05.693 --> 02:09.062
a basketball team,
and a baseball team.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.498
Well, how am I
supposed to remember?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.500
I mean, every fucking
American sports team's

02:12.600 --> 02:15.336
just a bloody city
and some arbitrary animal
stuck together.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.004
- ( laughs )
- Oh, look at me.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.507
I'm a fan
of the Chicago Squids.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.210
- ( laughs )
- What does it even mean?

02:28.048 --> 02:30.384
( exhales )
Hello, lads.

02:31.685 --> 02:32.853
Mike, hut-hut.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.657
Hut-hut.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.994
Oh, touchdown!

02:41.094 --> 02:42.396
Yeah.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.332
How's it going?
Need anything?
Fancy a beer?

02:44.432 --> 02:45.899
No, it's, like,
10:00 in the morning.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.535
What, too early
for you lads, is it?

02:47.635 --> 02:50.103
Yeah, I'm normally
sipping a cold one
at this time of day.

02:50.204 --> 02:52.005
A little bit
of an alcoholic.

02:52.105 --> 02:53.541
But there you are.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.009
What are you using here?
Wood?

02:56.109 --> 02:58.212
- Plywood.
- Plywood.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.648
Yeah, wood's a good idea
for any kind of construction.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.750
I mean, they've been
using that for generations.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.719
Did I tell you
that my uncle used to be
in the building trade?

03:05.819 --> 03:08.422
- Yeah, a couple times.
- Yeah, good guy.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.225
Sadly, went up a ladder once,
fell off, killed himself.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.261
Not intentionally.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.896
Slipped or something.
Broke his spine.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.665
So be careful
up there, yeah?

03:18.999 --> 03:20.434
Where are you
gangsters from?

03:20.534 --> 03:22.836
- Long Beach.
- Greatest city
in the world.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.905
Yeah, we don't care
if you're a stranger.
We'll fucking die for you.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.375
- Sounds like where I'm from.
- Oh, yeah? Where's that?

03:27.475 --> 03:29.277
Just outside
Chipping Norton.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.913
Although I actually spent
a lot of time growing up
in Wiveliscombe.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.016
Are you happy
with the glass?

03:36.116 --> 03:37.551
What's that for,
the skylight?

03:37.651 --> 03:39.487
- Mike: Yeah.
- Let's take a look at this.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.221
Yeah, I wouldn't
touch that, man.
That's sharp.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.890
Yeah, it's all cool, dude.

03:44.157 --> 03:45.959
- Lopez: You all right?
- Yep.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.404
All right, well,
better get back to it.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.142
This-- yeah,
it's all good.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.877
See ya, boys.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.215
- Ah! Ah!
- Oh, man up.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.418
- You man up.
- ( doorbell rings )

04:10.518 --> 04:12.553
Oh, can you get
that for me, please,
'cause of the...

04:12.653 --> 04:15.489
Who is gonna stay
and wax your vagina?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.257
Vulgar.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.526
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.761
- Coffee and bagels.
- Oh, great.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.030
What do you need, mate?
'Cause I'm not feeling 100%.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.398
He's not
here to see you.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.999
He's here for me.
Come on.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.301
- What's this about?
- Marion.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.569
Of course it is.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.471
Wade:
All right, so Marion said

04:30.571 --> 04:32.205
she didn't want to
have contact with me
for 30 days.

04:32.306 --> 04:35.108
- Mm-hmm.
- And today the 30 days
are up.

04:35.208 --> 04:38.278
So, you know,
I want to do something

04:38.379 --> 04:40.348
to basically
save my marriage.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.449
Did you get
any cream cheese?

04:41.549 --> 04:42.983
Should be in the bag.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.519
- Well, I only see butter.
- Stuart, can you shut up?

04:45.619 --> 04:48.522
Can you not
be mean, please?

04:48.622 --> 04:51.792
Hey, Stuart,
I just bought the domain
name "Stuartisms."

04:51.892 --> 04:54.227
- So I got that
if you need it.
- That's a good idea.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.764
- I wish I could celebrate,
mate, but look at that.
- Whoa.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.299
So, well, what are you
thinking about doing?

04:59.400 --> 05:00.734
Well, I thought I would...

05:00.834 --> 05:03.871
write a really, really
romantic e-mail.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.307
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.510
I think you should do
something more exciting.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.911
- Well, I mean, I'm way
ahead of you there.
- Okay.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.913
I'm gonna also include
a link to the song

05:13.013 --> 05:15.082
"Up Where We Belong"
from her favorite movie,

05:15.182 --> 05:16.484
"Officer and a Gentleman."

05:16.584 --> 05:18.686
Well, there you go.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.121
You should do something
like the end of that movie.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.490
You know,
I've never seen it.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.758
What? You've never seen
"An Officer and a G"?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.628
The chemistry between
Gere and Winger is insane.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.763
Wonder if anything
ever happened offscreen.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.738
You shitters taking off?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.306
Yeah, we should be done
by the end of the week.

05:39.407 --> 05:41.108
Yeah, no sweat.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.643
Good to have some real
men in the neighborhood
for a change.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.778
Aside from myself,
obviously.

05:44.878 --> 05:46.313
Yeah, most of the guys
around here wouldn't
know the difference

05:46.414 --> 05:48.616
between
a fucking claw hammer

05:48.716 --> 05:51.318
and a regular,
you know, everyday...

05:51.419 --> 05:52.753
sort of house hammer.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.188
Yeah, so why you
live here, then?

05:55.288 --> 05:57.157
What can I say?
Chicks dig the crib.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.527
Yeah, bet this house
keeps you balls-deep
in pussy, man.

05:59.627 --> 06:01.595
Yeah, I gets me oats.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.197
- Yeah.
- That chick you're banging,
she's pretty hot.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.533
The one who slept
in my bed last night?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.067
Yeah, she's
pretty smoking,

06:07.167 --> 06:09.503
but, uh, I'm not actually
banging her at the moment.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.304
She would love me to,
is the truth,

06:11.405 --> 06:13.240
but I have actually
got a little, sort of

06:13.340 --> 06:16.376
"will they, won't they"
thing going on with this
little cupcake.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.311
- All: Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Yeah. Damn. Oh, yeah.

06:18.412 --> 06:21.715
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She's draining your nuts?
For real?

06:21.815 --> 06:24.384
I wouldn't say she was
draining my nuts, per se.

06:24.485 --> 06:25.586
So, how far
you got with her?

06:25.686 --> 06:26.854
Like, oral or what?

06:26.954 --> 06:30.558
Not oral sex, but we
spoke on the phone.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.192
- ( laughs )
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:32.292 --> 06:34.327
- Shit, man, that's it?
- What are you talking about?

06:34.428 --> 06:36.497
You got hot chicks
coming out your ass,
you ain't fucking none of 'em?

06:36.597 --> 06:38.265
- Eh, fuck off.
- What's wrong with you?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.633
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.334
- What the fuck
are you talking about?
- What?

06:41.435 --> 06:42.703
You couldn't get laid
for six months.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.638
Oh, couldn't get laid
for six months.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.273
And you ended up
fucking Sharon Marino.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.941
- Oh!
- Fucking Sharon Marino.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.077
What are you talking about?
She was just my slump-buster.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.912
- Slump-buster.
- All right?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.981
Slump-buster, my ass.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.716
What's a slump-buster?

06:55.816 --> 06:58.185
It's just a chick you bang
to end a dry spell, man.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.920
Maybe that's
what I need.
As if.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.055
Well, you should
come to Long Beach, man.

07:02.155 --> 07:03.791
- Huh?
- The girls aren't all stuck
up and shit like in LA.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.359
- Really?
- They'll have sex
for days.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.828
Ooh, for days.
Right?

07:07.928 --> 07:10.097
You don't gotta eat
their pussy or nothing.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.800
That's...
a refreshing change.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.635
Down-to-earth.
That's what I like.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.003
Well, look, why don't you
come down sometime

07:16.103 --> 07:17.871
and we'll find you
a slump-buster, all right?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.640
Yeah, maybe I will.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.341
What are you
fuckheads doing tonight,
just out of interest?

07:21.441 --> 07:22.743
Getting drunk,
getting our dicks wet,

07:22.843 --> 07:24.978
- Long Beach style.
- Oh.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.414
LBC wet dick posse.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.982
Oh, sopping wet dicks.
Yes, please.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.986
Give you
a holler later.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.155
( movie score playing )

07:38.626 --> 07:41.361
Oh, this is so romantic.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.630
Yeah, why--
why is it?

07:42.730 --> 07:45.165
Because he's
being spontaneous.

07:45.265 --> 07:46.534
He's being assertive.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.435
What do they make
at this factory?

07:48.536 --> 07:50.771
Jessica:
You should do this
for Marion.

07:50.871 --> 07:52.139
If a guy surprised me
at work like that,

07:52.239 --> 07:53.974
I would be
totally blown away.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.510
They probably make something
for the local Navy base.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.612
But what?

07:58.712 --> 08:00.881
Wade, I think you should
do this for Marion tonight.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.651
Yeah, I think you should
go to her work, surprise her,

08:03.751 --> 08:04.985
take her to
her favorite restaurant,

08:05.085 --> 08:06.787
and then just see
where the night takes you.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.723
If you did that to me, whew,
I'd be putty in your hands.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.593
- Really?
- Real-- you've
already got my heart.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.662
- ( laughs )
- I think you should
go for it.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.997
Shoot, I can't.
I have Cassidy tonight.

08:17.097 --> 08:20.133
Well, I could watch her
for you, if you want.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.604
- Really?
- Yeah, if it's just
for a few hours.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.539
I think you should do it.

08:25.639 --> 08:27.675
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.312
Man, if I had a girl,
I'd carry her like that
every day.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.048
And I'd get one
of those suits, too.

08:54.835 --> 08:57.337
( car approaching )

08:57.437 --> 09:00.708
( music playing )

09:02.142 --> 09:06.980
Give us your wallet
or lick my fucking balls.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.449
Sir, if I lick your balls,
can I definitely keep
my wallet, please?

09:09.549 --> 09:12.586
( laughing )

09:12.686 --> 09:13.654
( laughs nervously )

09:13.754 --> 09:15.522
You're a funny fucker, dude.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.791
As soon as I saw
the tinted windows, I thought,
"It's those fuckers."

09:17.891 --> 09:19.359
And it was, and I thought,
"I'll screw with them."

09:19.459 --> 09:21.161
- And, you know...
- Get in.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.930
* What you think
'bout throwin' with a twist? *

09:23.030 --> 09:25.398
* Got the Playboy bitches
on my hit list... *

09:25.498 --> 09:28.435
( tires screeching )

09:28.535 --> 09:30.838
( laughing )

09:32.906 --> 09:35.375
- I'm Stuart, by the way.
- Pube.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.710
- Pube?
- Yeah.

09:36.810 --> 09:37.945
Your name is Pube?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.347
Yeah. Have some
pimp juice, fool.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.382
All:
Yeah!

09:42.482 --> 09:44.184
Take that shit.
Take it. Take a swig.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.087
- What is in this?
- You don't wanna
fucking know.

09:47.187 --> 09:48.822
( all laughing )

09:48.922 --> 09:51.825
- Drink that.
- ( all cheer )

09:53.761 --> 09:56.864
Oh, that's an interesting
combination of flavors.

09:56.964 --> 09:58.832
- ( laughing )
- What is in there?

09:58.932 --> 10:02.770
It feels like it's
behind my eyes, burning.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.839
Okay, great.
I can help you with that.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.341
Can I get your account
number, please?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.913
- ( music playing on phone )
- Great.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.784
* Love lift us up where
we belong... *

10:16.884 --> 10:19.653
Great.
Pulling that up now.

10:22.289 --> 10:24.725
Oh, fuck!
Oh, uh...

10:24.825 --> 10:27.594
I'm so sorry. Yes.
I have your account here.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.896
What are you doing here?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.497
These are for you.
Come on.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.232
No, Wade, Wade,
I'm at work.

10:32.332 --> 10:34.367
Can you turn off the music?
We're all on the phone.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.469
- Yeah, sorry.
- Sir, I'm not getting
your account number here.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.505
Do you have
a tracking number?

10:38.605 --> 10:40.808
- Where is Cassidy?
- I got a babysitter.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.510
- Oh. No, no, stop!
- Come on, I'm taking
you to dinner.

10:43.610 --> 10:46.680
Wade, Wade,
stop! Stop!
I'm sorry.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.316
Um, I am
so sorry, sir.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.619
Yes, it looks like
that will be to you
Tuesday morning.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.387
( whispers )
You should've called me.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.424
I'm just-- I was-- I'm just
trying to be spontaneous.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.327
Well, I have a break
in 20 minutes.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.263
We can have a cup of coffee
in the cafeteria, okay?

11:03.363 --> 11:04.531
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.466
- ( presses button )
- I am so sorry.

11:06.566 --> 11:08.535
If you call back
on Tuesday,

11:08.635 --> 11:12.773
it looks like we may
be able to give you
a more exact time.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.108
( music playing )

11:25.753 --> 11:27.654
Slump-buster central!

11:27.755 --> 11:29.156
Cool.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.625
What do you think about her
in the black and white dress?

11:32.726 --> 11:34.394
Stuart:
What's her story?

11:34.494 --> 11:36.864
Her name is Erika.
We call her Easy E

11:36.964 --> 11:39.800
because she is
a total nympho.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.770
- She sounds nice.
- Come on.

11:42.870 --> 11:45.839
Can you mention
that I own and operate
my own web design business?

11:45.939 --> 11:49.109
- Mike, hi!
- How you doing, baby?

11:49.209 --> 11:52.679
So, ladies, this is
my bro, Stuart.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.882
He is the fucking best.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.250
He owns his own
wedding design business.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.418
Web design, web design.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.187
And he will
take a bullet

12:00.287 --> 12:01.889
through the fucking
dick for you.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.091
Oh, Michael,
you're making me blush.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.192
But I would.

12:05.292 --> 12:08.061
- I love your accent.
- I like your accent.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.729
- Thanks.
- I like your nose ring
as well.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.064
- It's cool.
- Yo.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.732
- Where are you from?
- I'm from here.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.534
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:14.634 --> 12:15.936
Let's go, let's go!
Come on.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.470
What?
What's happening?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.738
We're gonna go
fuck someone up.

12:18.839 --> 12:21.041
All right, well,
good luck with that.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.843
- We need you.
- No, let's go.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.677
Are you sure
it's not better for me

12:24.778 --> 12:26.880
to just stay here
with the girls, like, save
a place at the bar?

12:26.980 --> 12:28.849
No, let's go, come on.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.185
We're gonna go
fuck someone up.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.766
Ooh, I really like
your picture.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.436
Thank you.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.904
- Purple girl?
- Purple girl.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.274
- ( giggles )
- ( phone chiming )

12:58.311 --> 13:00.013
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.382
Do you wanna hang?
I can be there in five minutes.

13:02.482 --> 13:03.984
Yeah, sure.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.519
Well, I'm babysitting,
so Cassidy will be here.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.221
Oh, cool.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.423
Yeah, I'm just
wrapping up some stuff.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.260
Probably be wrapping up
around the time you're done
babysitting.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.028
When will that be,
do you think?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.997
Um, just, like,
a couple hours or so?

13:17.097 --> 13:19.499
Oh, just text me
when you're done. Bye.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.503
Cassidy:
Who was that?

13:23.603 --> 13:26.539
That was Glenn.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.009
Is he your boyfriend?

13:29.109 --> 13:30.878
( chuckles )
It's complicated.

13:30.978 --> 13:33.914
- Do you kiss him?
- Sometimes.

13:34.014 --> 13:37.117
Then why isn't
he your boyfriend?
You're pretty.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.685
Well, maybe I don't
want a boyfriend.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.921
Does he want to
be your boyfriend?

13:41.021 --> 13:44.624
I don't know what
he's thinking exactly.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.994
Why don't you ask him?

13:47.094 --> 13:50.463
Well, I can't ask him.
I'll seem clingy.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.499
What the heck is clingy?

13:52.599 --> 13:53.700
It means
that I like him,

13:53.800 --> 13:55.202
but I don't
want to tell him

13:55.302 --> 13:57.670
because then
he'll use it against me.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.908
I have two boyfriends.

14:03.010 --> 14:05.979
Good for you.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.280
* Fuck 'em if you're
doing your thing *

14:07.380 --> 14:09.182
* They run,
point a finger *

14:09.282 --> 14:10.850
* Figure they got it
figured out *

14:10.951 --> 14:12.785
* This whole life
is a contradiction *

14:12.886 --> 14:14.221
* You're who? Hell, naw,
I won't listen *

14:14.321 --> 14:16.056
* Blow the universe
into submission *

14:16.156 --> 14:17.590
* Fuck 'em if you're
doing your thing *

14:17.690 --> 14:19.226
* They run,
point a finger... *

14:19.326 --> 14:20.427
What's up, bitch?

14:20.527 --> 14:22.562
Oh, what's up, Mike,
you fucking pussy?

14:22.662 --> 14:24.464
( chuckling )

14:26.066 --> 14:28.101
You got something to say
to my fucking face?

14:30.070 --> 14:31.371
I ain't got shit
to say to you, dawg.

14:31.471 --> 14:32.973
Mike:
Really?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.841
Why you talking all that shit
behind my back, then?

14:34.942 --> 14:37.344
Man:
I didn't say fuck
about you, homey.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.646
Be a man and admit it.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.114
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.616
Hey, man, I didn't say
fucking shit to you.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.985
I ain't scared
of you, dawg.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.054
Get your fucking facts
straight.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.922
Mike:
Oh, so now you're gonna
call my cousin a liar?

14:49.022 --> 14:51.024
No, I said check
the facts, dawg.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.993
Why don't you just be a man
and say it to my face?

14:53.093 --> 14:56.296
I will say it to your face.
I ain't scared to say
shit to your face.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.531
You had a whole lot
of shit to say Tuesday
night, all right?

14:58.631 --> 15:00.467
Fuck you, Mike.
Oh, shit!

15:00.567 --> 15:02.502
Hey, get off!

15:02.602 --> 15:04.737
Damn, man.
Shit.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.739
Look, I didn't say
shit, all right?

15:06.839 --> 15:09.409
But if I did,
I'm sorry.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.684
- Fuck it.
- Right? Cool.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.686
All right, man.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.621
Hey, we're gonna have
a party tonight at my house.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.423
- Yeah?
- You all are invited.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.392
- All right.
We'll see you tonight.
- Yeah.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.060
We're gonna have
some sushi and shit.
It's gonna be good.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.462
( laughs )
Holla.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.068
They almost got
their asses kicked.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.936
- Woman: Yeah.
- Right?

15:39.039 --> 15:41.808
Did you know Styrofoam
is a brand name?

15:41.908 --> 15:43.110
I didn't, no.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.212
Yeah, it's like Kleenex.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.647
Oh, yeah.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.384
This is just not how
I planned for tonight to go.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.586
No, it-- it was
a really sweet gesture.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.623
Yeah, thanks.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.393
So...

16:01.728 --> 16:05.398
is there a chance that
the door's still open for us?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.699
We'll see.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.736
Yeah.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.671
( music playing )

16:14.174 --> 16:17.044
Hey,
where you guys been?

16:17.144 --> 16:18.478
We just ordered shots.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.047
Oh, yes. That's what
I'm talking about.

16:20.147 --> 16:22.215
- Yes.
- Cheers.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.783
Salud.

16:23.883 --> 16:25.185
What happened
to your shirt?

16:25.285 --> 16:28.155
Oh, just a, you know,
rumble in the LBC.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.157
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm good, yeah.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.292
There was one player who was
giving me the evil eye,

16:32.392 --> 16:34.994
and I almost gave her--
gave him a beatdown,

16:35.095 --> 16:37.730
but I didn't need to
in the end, which is good.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.666
Just looking to get
back to the hot tub
now and chill out.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.768
- You have a hot tub?
- I got a hot tub, yeah.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.536
- So fucking cool.
- Well, you know.

16:43.636 --> 16:44.771
- Yo, Stuart.
- Yeah?

16:44.871 --> 16:47.140
- Wanna do a bump?
- Sure.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.642
No, no, no,
a bump of coke, man.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.079
- Cocaine?
- Yeah.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.513
Uh, I'm good
for coke, thanks.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.548
- Is that Jesse's shit?
- Yeah.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.150
- No, it's really good shit.
You should do it.
- Is it?

16:57.250 --> 16:58.518
- Yeah.
- No, I'm cool, I'm cool.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.054
- Come on, pussy.
- Don't be a pussy.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.923
Come on.
Just a little bit
of coke.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.258
All right,
I'll just do a gram.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.759
- A gram?
- Yeah.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.261
That's a fuckload
of coke.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.031
It's-- yeah, in England,
a gram is a smaller,

17:12.132 --> 17:14.867
but appropriate
amount of coke.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.103
So...

17:16.203 --> 17:17.804
let's just do
some bloody cocaine.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.072
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.442
- Come on, pussy.
- Give me a shot.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.043
( whispering )
Was she any trouble?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.146
No, no.
She does ask a lot
of questions, though.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.215
- Yeah, she does.
- Yeah.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.117
- Hey. Hey.
- Hi.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.752
So, how did it go
with Marion?

17:32.852 --> 17:34.187
- It went great.
- Oh, good.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.256
Yeah, she really
appreciated the gesture.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.758
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you for the advice.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.059
You're welcome.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.428
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

17:41.528 --> 17:43.830
- Romance is not dead.
- See ya.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.600
Man, I been thinking about
sucking your tits all day.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.402
Hmm.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.338
( music playing faintly )

17:59.879 --> 18:01.781
( snorts )

18:15.795 --> 18:18.198
- ( knock on door )
- Bouncer: Come out here.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.700
- Fuck.
- Relax.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.336
- ( pounds on door )
- Hey, did you hear me?
I said get out here.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.737
Yo, hold the fuck on, man.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.406
I'm on an H-1B visa.

18:26.506 --> 18:27.974
If they throw me
out of the country,
I'm fucked.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.309
I can't work again.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.244
It'll be okay.
Just chill out.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.380
- Well, what's our excuse?
- We don't need an excuse.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.914
We can't just walk out
and say nothing.

18:35.014 --> 18:36.883
Yes, we can.
Come on.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.621
'Sup?

18:43.156 --> 18:44.724
What were you guys
doing in there?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.627
- Nothing.
- I was sucking his cock.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.433
What-- what he said.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.381
Probably don't need
to mention what happened

19:08.481 --> 19:11.218
or what was said
or what you thought
was said, you know...

19:11.318 --> 19:14.287
Yo, you won't believe
what just fucking happened.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.958
Where are we going now?

19:19.058 --> 19:20.660
Did you say something?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.729
'Cause I couldn't hear
because of the dick
in your mouth.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.198
( all laugh )

19:25.298 --> 19:28.167
That's fucking cold.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.469
But where are we going,
though? Just--

19:29.569 --> 19:32.505
We're going
to Ronnie's party, man.

19:32.605 --> 19:33.773
Fuck, yeah.

19:35.242 --> 19:36.543
You know what, lads?
I've had a lovely night.

19:36.643 --> 19:38.478
But I think
it's bedtime for me,

19:38.578 --> 19:40.380
so if you could just
drop me at the train station,

19:40.480 --> 19:41.681
that'd be--
that'd be super.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.616
No, you're coming
for a drink, bitch.

19:43.716 --> 19:44.651
( all laugh )

19:44.751 --> 19:47.587
Lopez, Lopez, are you
sat on my seatbelt?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.256
- I can't seem to find it.
- That's the bitch seat, man.

19:49.356 --> 19:52.158
- No seatbelt.
- Bitch go through
the window!

19:52.259 --> 19:54.160
All:
Bitch go through
the window!

19:54.261 --> 19:56.162
Bitch go
through the window!

19:56.263 --> 19:57.664
This bitch go
through the window!

19:57.764 --> 19:59.666
- Say what?
- Bitch go through
the window!

19:59.766 --> 20:02.702
- I can't hear y'all!
- Bitch go through
the window.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.774
Oh.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.442
What's up?

20:09.542 --> 20:12.379
Do you ever wonder
what this is?

20:12.479 --> 20:15.382
This is two people
having fun.

20:15.482 --> 20:18.084
Yeah, but--
you know, I was talking
to my friend,

20:18.184 --> 20:19.652
and she was like,
"Is he your boyfriend?"

20:19.752 --> 20:22.289
and I was like,
"I don't know."

20:23.490 --> 20:25.692
- Mm-hmm.
- Are we just fuck buddies?

20:25.792 --> 20:29.228
'Cause honestly, I don't--
I don't know if I want that.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.764
First of all, thank you
for bringing this up.

20:31.864 --> 20:35.468
I hear
everything you're saying
and I understand,

20:35.568 --> 20:40.440
but I think it's dangerous
to try to define it.

20:40.540 --> 20:42.208
We have to let this go
where it wants to go,

20:42.309 --> 20:43.876
you know what I mean?

20:43.976 --> 20:45.812
Kind of.

20:45.912 --> 20:49.248
I mean, I don't want
to be your girlfriend today

20:49.349 --> 20:51.484
or anything like that.
I just...

20:51.584 --> 20:55.922
I'm wondering if
it's something that you
might want down the road.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.429
I hope it could be.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.665
But you or I might
be in a different space
in six months

21:05.765 --> 21:08.301
and not want whatever
this is now then,

21:08.401 --> 21:10.036
do you know what I mean?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.404
I think so.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.272
But if you're not happy
with what this is now

21:13.373 --> 21:14.607
or what
this could be then,

21:14.707 --> 21:17.076
I totally get it
and I'll just go.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.311
Oh, no, no, no.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.146
No, no, no.
Stay. You should stay.

21:20.246 --> 21:24.684
I just thought
that we should have
the conversation.

21:24.784 --> 21:28.220
And I agree,
the conversation
shouldn't end.

21:28.321 --> 21:29.989
It should be ongoing.

21:39.332 --> 21:41.534
- ( laughing )
- Oh, shit.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.937
Ronnie:
Go on, dawg,
it's a samurai.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.474
( laughing )

21:49.208 --> 21:50.977
Take this shit, man.

21:52.712 --> 21:56.315
( Pube laughs )
Shit's the bomb, right?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.121
Hey, English.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.690
Hello.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.692
Hey, man, why'd
you come to LA, dawg?

22:05.792 --> 22:06.793
Um...

22:06.893 --> 22:10.096
had to get out of England.
Some shit went down.

22:10.196 --> 22:12.198
Yeah?
What kind of shit?

22:12.298 --> 22:15.234
Well, there was...

22:15.334 --> 22:17.570
some chaps

22:17.670 --> 22:20.507
making-- making trouble
in my neighborhood

22:20.607 --> 22:24.377
and I got in
one little fight

22:24.477 --> 22:26.879
and my mum got scared

22:26.979 --> 22:29.949
and said, "You're moving
with your auntie and uncle

22:30.049 --> 22:32.051
in Bel Air."

22:32.151 --> 22:34.587
In the Bel Air area.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.022
Yep.

22:36.122 --> 22:39.759
Unfortunately, I've got
a presentation tomorrow,

22:39.859 --> 22:41.260
so I'm gonna
have to get back.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.262
Can I walk to the train
station from here?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.698
( all laugh )

22:45.798 --> 22:48.535
You can't walk
in this fucking
neighborhood, dawg.

22:48.635 --> 22:51.070
Shit, man.
Why do you think I got
this samurai sword?

22:51.170 --> 22:52.605
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.441
Hey, you meet
any chicks tonight?

22:54.541 --> 22:56.543
No, he blow D-boy.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.411
Man, fuck you, Pube.
Fuck you, too.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.379
- Fuck him.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.614
You suck dick?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.483
Me, dicks?
No. No, no, no.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.785
No, I-- I actually
came down here

23:05.885 --> 23:07.353
'cause they promised me
a slump-buster.

23:07.454 --> 23:09.288
( laughs )

23:09.388 --> 23:10.690
- I get that.
- Yeah.

23:10.790 --> 23:12.792
Well, then, what the fuck
are you doing in my house?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.360
I'm asking myself
the same question.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.128
What, you couldn't
get any girls in the LBC?

23:16.228 --> 23:18.397
Oh, no, I could've.
I could've, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

23:18.498 --> 23:22.368
I actually-- I met
a total biatch earlier

23:22.469 --> 23:25.037
at the club called--
they call her Easy E.

23:25.137 --> 23:28.441
And she was--
man alive, she was
a complete cockmonster.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.176
I mean, she was
gagging for it.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.578
I've lived here
all my life,

23:31.678 --> 23:33.279
and I never heard
of a girl named Easy E.

23:33.379 --> 23:34.747
- Really?
- What's she look like?

23:34.847 --> 23:37.617
Uh, she's all right-looking.
Kind of tanned.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.619
She's-- I think
her real name's Erika.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.420
She got a nose ring
right here?

23:41.521 --> 23:42.722
- Nose ring, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:42.822 --> 23:45.191
That's my fucking
half-sister, dawg.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.326
As I say, sweet girl.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.731
Why don't you tell me
who calls her Easy E?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.935
No one-- no one, really.
No one in particular.

23:57.704 --> 24:00.439
I'm gonna ask you
one more time, dawg.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.075
Who calls her Easy E?

24:04.410 --> 24:05.712
It was Mike, D-boy,
Lopez, and Pube.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.747
- What a bitch!
- What the fuck, guys?

24:07.847 --> 24:09.115
You're gonna believe
this asshole?

24:09.215 --> 24:11.083
- Why would
he lie to me, man?
- No reason.

24:11.183 --> 24:12.552
I don't know, but you need
to check your facts, son.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.320
You need to
check your facts.

24:14.420 --> 24:16.022
And what you
standing up for?

24:16.122 --> 24:20.059
You come down here,
all of you dicks
bouncing around...

24:20.159 --> 24:22.394
( overlapping arguing )

24:22.495 --> 24:25.064
Ronnie:
Hey, shove it up your ass.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.333
( dog barking )

24:27.433 --> 24:30.036
( arguing continues )

24:39.546 --> 24:41.614
Well, I've got
to get going.

24:41.714 --> 24:44.116
I'm sorry, I gotta
wake up at 6:00.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.718
Okay.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.881
( exhales )

25:16.415 --> 25:19.118
Did you change
these sheets?

25:19.218 --> 25:22.689
Yeah, I just thought
I would freshen it up.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.056
Yep.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.430
Cassidy:
And then we could draw
whatever we wanted to,

25:31.530 --> 25:33.766
so I drew dinosaurs

25:33.866 --> 25:35.935
and Mrs. Wolf said that
mine was the best one!

25:36.035 --> 25:37.904
Aw, that is so cool.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.371
- Is it all right if I--
- Yeah.

25:39.471 --> 25:41.107
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.842
- Do you want to see it?
- Yeah, I definitely do.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.376
- Will you get it for me?
- Yeah.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.778
Cool.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.513
- She did good today.
- Yeah? Good.

25:47.614 --> 25:50.216
Yeah. And I think she
ate all of her lunch.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.819
Stuffed animals.
Hey, you know what?
I wanted to say, too,

25:52.919 --> 25:55.855
I am sorry about
how that date went down.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.090
It didn't go exactly
as I planned it.

25:58.190 --> 26:00.359
I was thinking
maybe we could, you know,

26:00.459 --> 26:02.862
do something
a little more proper.

26:02.962 --> 26:05.097
Maybe I could
get a babysitter.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.233
What's wrong?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.636
- I'm sorry.
- No.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.340
But we should
get a divorce.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.044
Daddy, look!

26:21.513 --> 26:25.117
And this is a brontosaurus
because it's the longest one.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.954
- Yeah.
- And this one is another
brontosaurus.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.589
I think this one
is a pterodactyl.

26:40.967 --> 26:42.434
Hey, lads.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.503
Good job
on the guesthouse.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.272
Cool.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.340
- Here's the bill.
- Yeah.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.442
Oh, no, there's
a mistake there.

26:50.542 --> 26:53.545
No, you quoted $2,000.
You put $5,000.

26:53.646 --> 26:56.749
These things add up.
What can I tell you?

27:07.426 --> 27:09.395
( engine starts )

27:20.172 --> 27:21.507
Hello, ladies.

27:21.607 --> 27:24.210
( both laugh )

27:26.746 --> 27:29.348
Oh, for fuck's sake.

27:29.448 --> 27:32.484
* Out on the street
I was talking to a man *

27:32.584 --> 27:34.887
* He said, "There's so much
of this love of mine *

27:34.987 --> 27:37.123
* That I don't
understand" *

27:37.223 --> 27:40.459
* "You shouldn't worry,"
I said, "That ain't no crime *

27:40.559 --> 27:42.161
* 'Cause if you
get it wrong *

27:42.261 --> 27:44.296
* You'll get it right
next time" *

27:44.396 --> 27:46.198
* Next time

28:02.048 --> 28:04.851
* You need direction, yeah,
you need a name *

28:04.951 --> 28:07.253
* When you're standing
in the crossroads *

28:07.353 --> 28:09.421
* Every highway
looks the same *

28:09.521 --> 28:12.624
* After a while,
you can recognize the signs *

28:12.725 --> 28:16.662
* So if you get it wrong,
you'll get it right next time *

28:16.763 --> 28:18.697
* Next time.
