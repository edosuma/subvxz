08:35.249 --> 08:37.048
I don't wanna do this.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.718
Have you stopped long enough
ever to think that what you want

08:39.720 --> 08:42.220
and what other people want
are very different things?

I'm sorry
that we're not at home.

He's gonna do
what he's gonna do.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.319
Always has.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.525
They wouldn't wanna see him
like this.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.428
Um, at some point,
he's gonna have to learn

11:03.430 --> 11:06.531
to deal with
these things on his own.

with the place.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.241

12:29.249 --> 12:30.749
Some new art.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.352
Looks nice.

Yeah.

You..

Some finger painting?

12:52.672 --> 12:55.140
Karen's been doing some
shadowing.

12:55.142 --> 12:56.374

13:00.213 --> 13:03.014
And I recently, uh, moved up
to the new high school.

13:06.987 --> 13:10.388
We've been thinking, um, that
the time might just be right

13:10.390 --> 13:13.825

you are always welcome
to -- to come down.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.304

17:42.562 --> 17:44.595
I'm sorry about that.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.335
I just really haven't been
there and..

17:55.508 --> 17:57.675
I don't want you to be alone.

I..

I think he might be dangerous.

...is to remain very still.

At least until we --

Oh, remain very still.
Remain very still? Wha..

If you called somebody right now
and told them what I just told
the two of you

25:30.396 --> 25:31.929
what do you think
they would say?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.597
Would they believe you?

25:33.599 --> 25:35.499
Would they believe us?

If we called someone
and said that

you somehow caught the devil

and he's behind
your cellar door.

25:59.759 --> 26:03.627
There is something evil locked
behind that fucking door.

It has conjured itself
into the shape of a man.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.702
I have seen it.
I have felt it.

What's the plan?

27:10.329 --> 27:12.162
You just keep him locked
down there forever?

27:12.164 --> 27:14.331
Yeah..

No. Stop.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.469
Listen to me.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.971
I have stood by your side

29:00.973 --> 29:07.578
and your family's side
through everything. Everything.

for a normal life

- No, this is not grieving.

29:20.860 --> 29:24.027
- This is --
- This, this feels different.

29:24.029 --> 29:26.997
He believes this, it's..

29:26.999 --> 29:32.136
- No.
- All I'm saying is, what if?

29:32.138 --> 29:35.472
If you think even
for one moment that --

29:35.474 --> 29:37.474
No. Uh..

29:38.544 --> 29:41.145
You're right, okay?

29:42.214 --> 29:44.214
This is a nightmare.

29:45.518 --> 29:48.152
But I won't have him
spend his life in prison.

29:50.055 --> 29:53.123
He hasn't left us
very many options, has he?

29:59.999 --> 30:02.933
We.. We'll just let him go.

30:02.935 --> 30:06.403
We have enough in savings,
we just cut the guy a check.

30:06.405 --> 30:10.107
We don't even know who he is or
how long he's been down there.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.076
We get Steve the help
that he needs.

30:13.078 --> 30:16.480
'Cause Steve's just gonna let
him waltz out of there, right?

30:16.482 --> 30:18.649
Baby..

30:18.651 --> 30:22.386
...there are crosses
on the doors.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.688
The windows are covered.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.324
This is less about
keeping someone in

30:27.326 --> 30:30.828
as it is about keeping
everyone else out.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.830
[intense music]

30:50.950 --> 30:52.850
[faint screaming]

30:52.852 --> 30:54.852
[heavy breathing]

31:06.165 --> 31:08.165
[woman screaming]

31:13.606 --> 31:16.073
Faith makes people dangerous.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.943
He's not.

31:19.945 --> 31:21.578
[sighs]

31:23.349 --> 31:26.884
There's a gun upstairs
and it's loaded.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.556
[music continues]

31:59.385 --> 32:00.951
[sighs]

32:00.953 --> 32:03.787
I am tired.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.656
May I?

32:21.974 --> 32:23.407
[clears throat]

32:33.485 --> 32:36.620
What happened to us?

32:36.622 --> 32:38.622
I don't know.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.760
It's gonna be okay.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.572
I need you to believe me.

32:59.611 --> 33:01.979
Then help me.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.780
There's something in the air.

33:03.782 --> 33:08.585
There is a presence...now,
it takes on many different forms

33:08.587 --> 33:12.089
but it has been around for
as long as anybody can remember.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.427
Alright, you're a teacher.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.963
Now, take an educated guess
as to how many people

33:19.965 --> 33:22.132
in this country,
this year alone

33:22.134 --> 33:24.134
faced a violent death.

33:25.771 --> 33:27.838
I don't..

33:29.308 --> 33:32.576
My wife cheated on me. Bang!

33:32.578 --> 33:36.046
I just needed a little money.
Bang!

33:36.048 --> 33:40.050
Today, I just didn't like the
look on his smug fucking face.

33:40.052 --> 33:42.853
Bang!
It's a cycle.

33:42.855 --> 33:48.392
Now this man defines evil
as a tangible force.

33:48.394 --> 33:51.728
Meddling in our affairs
with two very different agendas.

33:51.730 --> 33:57.801
Now, there's man's evil,
in which man harms man for
the sake of greed, and vanity.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.837
And there's pure evil,
in which man harms man

34:00.839 --> 34:03.507
for no other reason
than to watch him suffer.

34:04.910 --> 34:07.010
It's all curated.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.713
And you believe that?

34:11.250 --> 34:14.251
Numbers and equations are only
gonna get you so far, Matt.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.022
So I decide to go outside,
walk down the street

34:19.024 --> 34:20.857
and just shoot somebody
in the face?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.227
Well, you wouldn't.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.363
Even in today's highly
enlightened society

34:26.365 --> 34:30.534
there remains a certain stigma
against becoming a homicidal
psychopath.

34:30.536 --> 34:33.537
It's, it's the instinct.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.105
It's the idea.

34:35.107 --> 34:39.042
Now without the seed,
that thought would never
even register.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.913
And keeping him down there?

34:46.752 --> 34:48.752
I trapped the seed.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.754
[intense music]

34:51.957 --> 34:54.291
Let me show you something.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.715
You did all this?

35:18.717 --> 35:20.784
[music continues]

35:20.786 --> 35:24.888
<i> At first</i>
<i> there's a lot of dead air.</i>

35:24.890 --> 35:27.390
Bullshit to it all,
but after a while

35:28.527 --> 35:30.660
you start peeling back layers

35:32.498 --> 35:34.731
there's a pattern.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.744
How long has all this
been going on?

35:47.746 --> 35:51.281
Now it's still too early, to
save the forest for the trees,
but, uh..

35:53.018 --> 35:55.152
You listen to the news

35:55.154 --> 35:59.623
you watch TV, things are
changing right before our eyes.

36:02.561 --> 36:04.728
<i> I mean, we are on the</i>
<i> precipice of something.</i>

36:05.531 --> 36:06.930
<i> [Steve exhales]</i>

36:08.167 --> 36:11.067
Here, listen.
You know this story. Right?

36:12.571 --> 36:15.105
- Buckler girl?
- Mm-hm.

36:15.107 --> 36:17.874
Missing for a month.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.310
And then out of the blue
she's back.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.312
Now, I think..

36:24.616 --> 36:27.217
...given enough time

36:27.219 --> 36:29.719
others are gonna start
showing up.

36:31.790 --> 36:36.393
You know...you could have
called me

36:36.395 --> 36:38.895
before all of...this.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:40.032 --> 36:41.665
Even if the man's evil
who's responsible

36:41.667 --> 36:44.768
for 99.9%
of this world's bullshit

36:44.770 --> 36:48.972
that point one percent...
millions.

36:48.974 --> 36:54.311
There's millions.
Who even could just for a
second live without that pain?

36:56.915 --> 36:58.615
Shh, shh.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.691
[intense music]

37:35.387 --> 37:37.387
Who's been calling?

37:43.629 --> 37:46.129
I think something's coming
for him.

37:51.169 --> 37:53.970
Yeah, sometimes I think I, uh

37:54.840 --> 37:57.073
I, uh, see things.

37:58.543 --> 38:00.543
I hear things.

38:02.180 --> 38:04.314
Who else have you told
about this?

38:05.951 --> 38:08.418
See, I don't think
I had to tell anyone.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.528
[intense music]

39:05.477 --> 39:10.246
Good, bad, evil.

39:10.248 --> 39:13.783
It's like, it's like
you're building a road, hm?

39:13.785 --> 39:14.884
But you don't know
how far it goes

39:14.886 --> 39:17.721
but you know the destination.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.622
Now, something gets in your,
in your path

39:19.624 --> 39:22.058
you're not just gonna give up.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.327
You're gonna find a way around

39:24.329 --> 39:25.795
until you're back on course.

39:27.532 --> 39:30.066
At first I thought,
I -- I thought it was off.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.935
And people
I had never even met before

39:31.937 --> 39:35.805
would just stop and stare at me.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.975
But it wasn't them.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.512
And then now..

39:44.282 --> 39:45.849
...at this critical moment..

39:46.752 --> 39:48.351
...after two years..

39:49.688 --> 39:51.688
...you two show up.

39:53.859 --> 39:56.459
- That's not why --
- Well, that you know of.

39:58.797 --> 40:02.665
Someone.. Something.

40:02.667 --> 40:06.703
I -- I'm not even sure if it is
a thing, is coming.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.805
All I know is

40:08.807 --> 40:10.707
you back a dog into a corner

40:10.709 --> 40:12.976
you take away
his means of escape and..

40:14.312 --> 40:15.979
...he's gonna bite.

40:19.651 --> 40:22.018
He doesn't wanna be down there
anymore.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.825
Where's Karen?

41:06.164 --> 41:08.164
I'm here.

41:11.303 --> 41:15.104

41:28.553 --> 41:30.653

out of my face.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.411
I know you felt it.

43:42.654 --> 43:44.654
You were right.

43:46.725 --> 43:49.392
You don't need us.

43:49.394 --> 43:51.394
You never did.

43:54.799 --> 43:57.367
You can do whatever you want.

43:59.804 --> 44:03.072
