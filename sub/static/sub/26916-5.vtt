WEBVTT

00:11.040 --> 00:13.800
[Uhtred] I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.

00:13.880 --> 00:16.440
King Alfred grows weaker each day,

00:17.480 --> 00:20.520
leaving Wessex vulnerable
to enemies within.

00:20.600 --> 00:23.000
-Aethelwold is there?
-[Haesten] They will march

00:23.080 --> 00:26.040
from north to south as a single army.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.440
[Uhtred] I, too, am now seen as a threat.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.880
But I've promised to protect
Alfred's daughter, Aethelflaed.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.840
Your husband intends to kill you.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.120
I shall leave now,
and you must do the same.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.560
[Uhtred] Indeed, both Aethelred
and Haesten wish her dead.

00:40.480 --> 00:43.480
Saving her life
has come at a high cost to me.

00:43.560 --> 00:45.160
Skade in place of Aethelflaed.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.280
You are cursed once more,
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

00:49.360 --> 00:52.200
I've been thinking about Ragnar
and him killing me.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.320
I should kill him first.

00:54.040 --> 00:57.160
[Uhtred] My brother has disowned me
as a traitor.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.640
And it is true.

00:58.720 --> 01:00.640
You are no longer my brother!

01:00.720 --> 01:02.640
[Uhtred] I betrayed him by leaving him

01:02.720 --> 01:04.800
-amid men without honor.
-[grunting]

01:04.879 --> 01:05.920
[choking]

01:06.920 --> 01:08.400
[breathing heavily]

01:08.480 --> 01:10.200
[Uhtred] Destiny is all.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.080
[Jackdaw] He's dead!

01:32.760 --> 01:33.760
He's dead!

01:34.520 --> 01:37.480
[laughs] Alfred is dead! He's dead!

01:38.520 --> 01:39.960
Alfred's dead!

01:40.040 --> 01:43.680
-The Saxon cur is no more! He's dead!
-[men clamoring]

01:43.760 --> 01:45.400
Alfred is dead!

01:45.480 --> 01:47.720
Jackdaw, is this true?
How did you hear this?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.400
It's all over the country, they say.
He's dead!

01:50.480 --> 01:53.280
Alfred shat his precious soul
out of his arsehole.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.400
[laughs]

01:54.480 --> 01:55.960
Ragnar, Alfred is dead!

01:56.720 --> 01:58.240
The Saxon shit is gone!

01:59.440 --> 02:00.520
Ragnar!

02:04.800 --> 02:05.920
Ragnar?

02:08.440 --> 02:09.440
Ragnar?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.400
[gasps]

02:19.840 --> 02:21.240
[breathing heavily]

02:22.840 --> 02:23.760
Ragnar.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.400
Ragnar.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.960
[crying]

02:36.000 --> 02:37.400
[breathing heavily]

02:43.280 --> 02:45.160
Take it. Close your hand.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.840
Ragnar. Ragnar, close your hand
and take this.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.120
Ragnar, take this.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.520
Ragnar, take it! No!

02:55.600 --> 02:56.680
No!

02:56.760 --> 02:58.680
No, Ragnar, no!

02:58.760 --> 03:00.840
No! No!

03:01.560 --> 03:02.920
No!

03:03.000 --> 03:04.960
No! [sobbing]

03:05.040 --> 03:07.280
[Cnut] So, he's dead.
This is good news.

03:07.880 --> 03:09.880
[Brida] No! No!

03:10.720 --> 03:12.840
Ragnar! Ragnar!

03:12.920 --> 03:15.280
Ragnar, no! [sobbing]

03:17.560 --> 03:18.720
[Cnut] Move. Move!

03:19.400 --> 03:20.800
[Brida sobbing]

03:21.520 --> 03:23.880
Ragnar, no. No.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.080
[Brida continues sobbing]

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
Who?

03:32.760 --> 03:34.000
Who did this?

03:36.680 --> 03:37.760
His whore?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.720
I will ask.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
[grunts]

03:48.040 --> 03:49.600
[breathing heavily]

03:51.560 --> 03:55.840
Ragnar Ragnarson,
the only man amongst you, is dead!

03:55.920 --> 03:58.120
-Who did this?
-[indistinct murmuring]

03:59.880 --> 04:02.360
Cowards! All of you!

04:02.440 --> 04:04.560
You had to kill him while he was sleeping?

04:04.640 --> 04:07.240
-Brida, it was his woman.
-[breathing heavily]

04:08.080 --> 04:09.760
The knife was in her hand.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.760
It was Ragnar's sword in her belly.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.360
Why would he kill a woman
he was trying to pup?

04:14.440 --> 04:15.920
Why would she kill him? How?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.800
Maybe it was you who killed him.

04:18.640 --> 04:23.040
Her husband was ploughing another field,
so the crazy bitch killed them both.

04:23.120 --> 04:25.200
-[screams]
-[both grunt]

04:25.920 --> 04:27.320
Bloodhair, no.

04:28.840 --> 04:30.040
[breathing heavily]

04:32.880 --> 04:34.080
[grunts]

04:34.160 --> 04:35.720
This is not the answer.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.400
He was your leader!

04:37.480 --> 04:40.320
He was to give you wealth!
Protection!

04:40.880 --> 04:41.800
[Cnut] We go on.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.200
-Nothing has changed.
-Everything has changed.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.360
-We go on.
-[breathing heavily]

04:48.440 --> 04:49.560
You...

04:49.640 --> 04:51.280
You have no leader.

04:51.360 --> 04:52.920
Then I shall lead.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.400
With Bloodhair.

04:57.680 --> 05:00.560
We will bury Ragnar, and we will march.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.040
Get it done, and keep her quiet.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.160
Release her.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.400
[breathing heavily]

05:23.080 --> 05:25.560
Though I did not know him well,
he was a good man.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.520
A brave warrior.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.560
[theme music playing]

06:23.080 --> 06:24.480
Are you going to behave?

06:33.960 --> 06:36.360
You speak to him as if he understands.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.480
He will not understand the words, but...

06:42.240 --> 06:44.160
he will know I'm a friend.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.360
Someone he can trust.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.880
So, when the time comes to push him
into battle, he will not hesitate.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.120
Is that the way you treat your men?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.920
You win their trust
and expect them to follow?

06:58.880 --> 07:01.480
It is not a game, nor a strategy.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.000
It is who you are.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.360
A man who instills trust.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.840
I would like you to kiss me.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.200
And then?

07:26.600 --> 07:28.760
Begin with a kiss and see where it leads.

07:34.560 --> 07:37.600
-If you would rather not--
-It is something I would enjoy...

07:39.240 --> 07:40.760
and then regret.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.520
Lady, in Erik, you chose someone
you could not be with.

07:47.600 --> 07:48.520
And I am the same.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.360
I would not see you hurt again.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.600
Who would have to know?

07:55.280 --> 07:58.440
-Who would need to know--
-Skade. Skade would know.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.320
She would see
everything I care for destroyed.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.640
[Aethelflaed sighs]

08:05.720 --> 08:07.920
She must be found, recovered.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.360
I would say, it is impossible for you
to recover her.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.640
-I must.
-How?

08:13.720 --> 08:15.800
You cannot attack Beamfleot.

08:16.480 --> 08:19.280
To fight Haesten's army,
you will need an army.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.760
My Father is to join the Mercians
at Aegelesburg.

08:25.400 --> 08:28.480
I will meet him with our guards
and Aethelred.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.280
You will be safer there than here.

08:31.960 --> 08:33.080
It is a good decision.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.919
I will tell the king
of Haesten's attempt to kill me.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.640
By attacking me,
he has made himself an enemy of Wessex.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.400
Come with me.

08:42.440 --> 08:46.120
My father will forgive you, and you will
lead his men against Beamfleot.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.360
-I do not want his forgiveness.
-Then use his army.

08:50.520 --> 08:53.400
Use his men, and recover Skade.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.200
I offer you a way to end this curse.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.120
Lord, we are ready...

09:16.880 --> 09:18.320
for another chapter.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.480
The country is rife
with word of my death, I am told.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.920
So what a fright you shall be
to the Danes,

09:25.000 --> 09:26.920
marching beyond Wessex and into Mercia

09:27.000 --> 09:30.280
to stand by the side of Aethelred
and look them in the eye.

09:30.360 --> 09:32.000
To look them in the eye.

09:34.440 --> 09:35.280
Yes.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.960
Steapa, when you are ready.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.080
Yes, Lord.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.600
[breathing heavily]

10:35.080 --> 10:36.040
We march!

10:36.120 --> 10:38.200
Men of Wessex...

10:39.560 --> 10:41.000
we march!

10:41.080 --> 10:42.880
[all cheering]

11:21.720 --> 11:22.880
Leave us.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.760
Some of his men believe this to be a sign.

11:35.840 --> 11:38.720
For Ragnar to die without his sword
means the battle can't be won.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.680
They're your men now.

11:42.240 --> 11:43.960
You must convince them otherwise.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.160
I won't prevent any man
from returning north.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.800
-They have no leader.
-We can lead.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.440
You and I.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.960
This morning you said you'd
lead with Bloodhair, now you choose me?

11:56.640 --> 11:58.720
I do not wish to bed Bloodhair.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.000
[Brida] Already we're divided.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.440
Without Ragnar,
we shall become separate tribes.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.520
-I will let you grieve.
-[sniffles]

12:15.600 --> 12:17.480
You'll find us at River Ouse.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.800
One army.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.200
It was either you or Bloodhair
who killed Ragnar.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.080
You cannot accept
that his last night was spent with a whore

12:29.160 --> 12:30.760
and that she killed him.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.280
Who knows what goes on between
a man and a woman?

12:36.800 --> 12:39.320
Ragnar did not appreciate
nor deserve your love.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.400
[Brida sniffles]

13:33.440 --> 13:34.640
[sniffles]

13:35.600 --> 13:37.680
[Cnut] We have lost a great warrior.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.080
A great man.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.840
I know this better than most.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.440
Ragnar Ragnarson was my cousin.

13:47.520 --> 13:48.960
And I'm angry with him

13:49.720 --> 13:52.280
-because he deserved a better death!
-[all agreeing]

13:52.360 --> 13:55.440
Killed half naked.
Killed without his breeches and his sword!

13:56.640 --> 13:58.040
Far from the battlefield.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.120
It is a death I fear most.

14:00.200 --> 14:01.640
[all exclaiming]

14:01.720 --> 14:06.160
It is a death our great warrior Bloodhair
fears most.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.720
But we men standing here
are fortunate men!

14:09.800 --> 14:12.760
-The gods are with us.
-[all] Yes!

14:12.840 --> 14:16.200
We have swords in hand
and a battle ahead of us.

14:17.080 --> 14:20.160
Land to be won, silver to be shared

14:20.240 --> 14:22.680
-and Saxons to kill!
-[all cheering]

14:25.440 --> 14:27.920
We are Danes together!

14:28.000 --> 14:29.400
[all shouting]

14:29.480 --> 14:30.960
Together!

14:31.040 --> 14:32.680
[all] Together!

15:06.720 --> 15:08.400
[both grunting]

15:09.800 --> 15:10.640
[grunts]

15:13.040 --> 15:13.880
Osferth.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.480
Fetch Uhtred.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.280
Tell him we have a guest.
A woman.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.880
How can you tell it's a woman?

15:23.760 --> 15:24.880
You have to ask?

15:28.360 --> 15:29.400
Fetch Uhtred.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.120
I knew you'd be with your princess.

15:46.360 --> 15:47.720
Something has happened?

15:49.160 --> 15:50.360
You left him.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.680
Ragnar?

15:53.760 --> 15:58.040
He had waited years for you to come home
and within a matter of days you were gone.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.160
You should've left the Saxon bitch to die.

16:03.240 --> 16:04.760
Where is he? I will go to him.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.760
He's dead! Ragnar is dead!

16:16.280 --> 16:17.880
He doesn't feast in Valhalla.

16:17.960 --> 16:22.520
Instead, he lies under a pile of stones
at a lake near Loidis!

16:26.200 --> 16:28.240
There was no honor in his death.

16:29.720 --> 16:30.760
None.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.880
He will spend eternity
in the cold of Niflheim,

16:34.960 --> 16:38.440
because of you, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.280
[inhaling sharply]

16:40.360 --> 16:41.640
You chose her.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.760
-You chose Alfred and you left him.
-[gasps]

16:46.840 --> 16:47.920
No, Sihtric.

16:49.240 --> 16:50.440
I should kill you...

16:51.840 --> 16:54.320
but I want you to live
with the pain of his death.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.600
He was your brother.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.599
Uhtred, I...

17:20.680 --> 17:22.920
My brother is dead.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.720
Oh, God.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.160
[Uhtred] It is her.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.680
Skade and her curse.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.320
It goes on and on.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.240
Could it not be just life?

17:35.560 --> 17:37.600
Death comes to us all.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.560
It is her.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.760
She must be recovered.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.440
We go to Alfred and to Aethelred.

17:44.520 --> 17:45.760
We do?

17:46.360 --> 17:49.360
And we beg for an army.

18:19.240 --> 18:22.960
Once the last of Bloodhair's men
sail up the Ouse...

18:24.160 --> 18:25.960
-we will march on Mercia...
-[sniffs]

18:27.120 --> 18:28.160
...and then Wessex.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.920
He will have me send you to him.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.640
Bloodhair.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.280
It is I who choose who I sit with.

18:51.280 --> 18:52.360
Lie with.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.280
Kill.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.960
You have only ever taken women.

18:59.560 --> 19:01.520
They do not give themselves to you.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.080
Whether it is given or taken,

19:05.320 --> 19:06.400
I get what I want.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.600
You may take my body,

19:11.520 --> 19:14.120
-but you will not have my power.
-[chuckles]

19:14.920 --> 19:17.040
I have 1,000 men.

19:18.160 --> 19:19.480
That is power enough.

19:20.200 --> 19:23.280
The man I choose, he will benefit greatly
from Alfred's death.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.520
But I will have to give myself
to that man...

19:34.800 --> 19:36.160
and only when it is earned.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.440
Maybe, I should just hump you now

19:42.120 --> 19:43.680
and be done with it.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.680
Prove yourself, Lord.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.760
[scoffs]

19:47.840 --> 19:49.320
Prove myself...

19:50.280 --> 19:51.280
to a woman?

19:52.800 --> 19:56.960
And I will allow you inside me
and my power inside you.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.120
Uhtred will come for me

20:00.200 --> 20:03.440
and if you are to take his place,
then you must first kill him.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.240
And then I am yours.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.880
[Haesten groans]

20:18.960 --> 20:20.960
[horn blows]

20:29.320 --> 20:30.520
[Steapa] Riders.

20:31.960 --> 20:33.240
Spears to the walls!

20:34.120 --> 20:35.400
[men clamoring]

20:37.680 --> 20:39.600
No man is to pass. No man.

21:04.760 --> 21:07.440
I ought to kill you where you stand, Lord.

21:08.160 --> 21:09.720
You could try, my friend.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.800
I'm here to see the king.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.520
-You ride with outlaws, my dear.
-[Aethelflaed] He's an outlaw of Wessex,

21:16.600 --> 21:17.960
not Mercia.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.840
We're here to see my father.

21:21.520 --> 21:23.400
What is it you have to say
to the king

21:23.480 --> 21:25.520
that you cannot say to your husband?

21:25.600 --> 21:29.240
I wish to speak of treachery and traitors.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.280
The Dane Haesten did attack
the nunnery at Wincelcumb.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.640
It was his purpose to kill me.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.840
[Uhtred] Haesten claims
to be a friend to Alfred.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.200
He's not.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.360
Let the outlaw pass.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.000
No weapons.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.400
None at all.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.440
[Finan] Lord Aethelred,

21:56.520 --> 21:58.760
like you, we stand against the Danes.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.600
[Steapa] No weapons
is the command, Irishman.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.080
None at all.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.520
It is good to see you safe, Lady.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.880
Lord Aldhelm.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.760
I shall advise the king you're here.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.160
My father cannot suspect
my husband is the traitor.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.600
We should kill your husband
and be done with it.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.040
And begin a war
between Wessex and Mercia now?

22:38.120 --> 22:41.080
Lady, I'm joking.
We'll kill him tomorrow.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.240
We halt. Stop!

22:43.320 --> 22:45.320
We know what "halt" means, big man.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.240
Steapa, we are both thirsty and hungry.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.000
You may enter the hall, Lady.

22:50.080 --> 22:51.960
The outlaws do not.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.560
Then I choose to remain here
with the outlaws.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.920
As you wish.

22:58.000 --> 23:00.160
Um, what if I need to piss?

23:08.720 --> 23:10.360
Then take out your cock.

23:10.440 --> 23:13.320
And if you mistake it for a weapon,
what then?

23:14.120 --> 23:17.320
Steapa, food and ale would be appreciated.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.280
I will arrange it.

23:22.040 --> 23:24.720
And Steapa, good food.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.560
Meat and lots of ale!

23:28.240 --> 23:30.600
[indistinct chatter]

23:30.680 --> 23:33.640
If Uhtred is no longer with the Danes,
that is one matter.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.600
But should he realign himself
with Alfred or Edward,

23:36.680 --> 23:37.840
that is another.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.560
What has occurred to bring Uhtred
from one side to the other?

23:42.240 --> 23:43.400
He is Uhtred.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.680
Who called him from north to south?

23:47.440 --> 23:50.040
-My wife?
-How, Lord?

23:50.600 --> 23:51.720
Why?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.680
Why did she call him to her aid?

23:54.440 --> 23:56.120
What does she know?

23:56.200 --> 23:57.520
Is it important?

23:57.600 --> 24:00.800
When Danes are marching
and we are unsure of which side we stand?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.520
Yes, it is important.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.840
Very!

24:07.120 --> 24:09.160
She knew of the danger posed by me.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.560
She fled,

24:12.960 --> 24:14.080
summoned Uhtred...

24:15.240 --> 24:17.160
with the promise of her bed, no doubt.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.680
She knew.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.160
Then, Lord, may I suggest,
we first establish

24:24.240 --> 24:26.120
what work Uhtred has with her father.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.920
I want all of my men at the ready.

24:28.560 --> 24:29.720
For what?

24:30.560 --> 24:34.320
If she is here to accuse me,
to discredit me,

24:34.400 --> 24:35.920
we must be ready.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.760
Yes, Lord.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.400
-Steapa.
-Lord Sigebriht.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.760
An approximation to a witan has gathered.

24:46.440 --> 24:48.160
The outlaws are required.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.160
What is an approximation to a witan?

24:52.240 --> 24:54.280
It's almost a witan, but not quite.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.720
We must be without the king.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.960
Apologies for keeping you waiting
in the cold, my dear.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.400
Your father is to blame.

25:16.480 --> 25:20.080
After deliberation,
he has decided not to attend.

25:20.160 --> 25:22.600
I am here in place of the king.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.320
I'm here to speak for the king.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.240
Our business is with Alfred.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.760
Edward is Alfred.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.640
On this occasion.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.440
We are all curious
of what you have to say, my dear.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.320
Speak.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.760
Danes are near.

25:38.720 --> 25:41.920
Yes. Which is why we are gathered.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.680
This is not some hunting party.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.280
Haesten is with them.
His army is allied with them.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.680
But it was Haesten
who first advised the king

25:48.760 --> 25:50.480
that the Danes were
marching south.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.080
He would do that, Lord.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.200
Haesten also advised the king

25:54.280 --> 25:57.440
this Dane army included yourself,
Uhtred Ragnarson.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.120
It does not, Father.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.600
Which we can clearly see.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.120
Haesten has betrayed the king.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.720
He rode to Mercia to kill me.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.200
Uhtred saved me.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.400
God is good. Praise him!

26:08.480 --> 26:09.600
[all] Praise him.

26:09.680 --> 26:11.760
[stuttering] I am at a loss.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.440
How is it that Uhtred knew of this danger?

26:16.520 --> 26:17.400
[sighs]

26:17.480 --> 26:20.120
How is it that he knew
exactly where to find you?

26:20.200 --> 26:22.080
An interesting question, Lord.

26:22.160 --> 26:24.080
An irrelevant question.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.600
Uhtred made a plan with this Dane,
this Haesten,

26:27.680 --> 26:30.280
to save you, to gain your trust,

26:30.360 --> 26:32.480
-gain entry to this estate.
-No.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.560
A spy.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.120
-An assassin.
-[all murmuring]

26:36.200 --> 26:37.880
[Aethelflaed] No, he saved me.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.920
I should've expected nothing different.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.480
He has risked all for me--

26:41.560 --> 26:43.720
That's what
he wants you to believe, surely.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.120
Seems a rather grand strategy,
Lord Aethelred.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.000
-And for what?
-He is here, among us.

26:49.080 --> 26:50.680
[Edward] And under guard.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.280
Then let us get to the truth
of the matter.

26:57.840 --> 27:01.120
Let us hear exactly why Uhtred is here.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.680
What do you have to say to me?

27:15.120 --> 27:16.680
I wish to speak to you alone.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.840
This is a witan.
We are one people.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.440
What you have to say affects all of us.

27:22.520 --> 27:25.720
These men are my friends and allies.
I have nothing to hide.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.960
I saved your daughter's life.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.200
It was Haesten's intention to kidnap her.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.840
If that could not be done,
he would have killed her.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.480
And you claim that he, too, is your ally.

27:41.560 --> 27:42.640
I've never said that.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.320
I have listened to Haesten,
but I've never believed him fully.

27:52.120 --> 27:56.000
That you are here with Aethelflaed
is the only reason you are alive.

28:00.320 --> 28:04.800
Do not tell me what you have done.
Tell us all what it is you want.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.200
You always want something.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.320
-I want 1,000 men.
-[scoffs]

28:13.400 --> 28:16.120
One thousand men,
and I will give you Beamfleot.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.080
I do not need Beamfleot.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.040
I will give you peace.

28:21.680 --> 28:22.800
I will defeat Haesten.

28:22.880 --> 28:26.200
I will prevent him from joining
with the Earls Cnut and Bloodhair.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.840
Not forgetting the Earl Ragnar.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.800
My brother is dead, Lord.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.040
[indistinct murmuring]

28:31.120 --> 28:33.240
[Uhtred] That is to your advantage.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.240
With Haesten defeated and Ragnar gone,

28:35.320 --> 28:38.280
the Danes will have
half the army and no leader.

28:38.360 --> 28:40.720
To prevent a great war,
you must attack Haesten.

28:41.560 --> 28:43.280
That seems viable, Lord.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.120
You wish me to divide my army?

28:46.200 --> 28:48.640
-Yes.
-[Alfred] Send 1,000 men east?

28:48.720 --> 28:51.640
-Yes.
-That is too great a risk to Wessex, Lord.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.400
Haesten sits inside a fortress.

28:53.480 --> 28:56.200
One thousand men could die
upon its walls easily.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.480
And then what?

28:57.560 --> 28:58.920
We are overrun.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.640
We devise a plan.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.960
Why?

29:03.160 --> 29:05.400
What is at stake for Uhtred Ragnarson?

29:08.240 --> 29:10.320
Is it Mercia you care for? Is it Wessex?

29:10.400 --> 29:11.840
There another reason for this attack?

29:11.920 --> 29:13.400
Vengeance, Lord.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.680
-Do you require the detail?
-You seek vengeance?

29:18.760 --> 29:21.640
-I do.
-[Aethelhelm] The man is a fool,

29:21.720 --> 29:24.120
who believes all of us to be fools.

29:24.840 --> 29:27.800
You arrived here under the protection
of the Lady of Mercia.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.720
I shan't undermine that protection.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.360
You are free to leave
when you are ready and rested.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.880
You remain an outlaw of Wessex.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.640
[voices whispering indistinctly]

29:40.640 --> 29:41.800
[door opens]

29:43.240 --> 29:46.040
Are you here to join me in prayer,
Father Pyrlig?

29:46.120 --> 29:48.480
I am not. [panting]

29:48.560 --> 29:52.240
My Lord Edward would like to speak
with Uhtred.

29:52.320 --> 29:53.480
About what?

29:53.560 --> 29:56.120
I would like to give him hope, Father.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.040
-Hope.
-Half the number of men he asked for.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.600
-Or more.
-Ah.

30:00.680 --> 30:04.400
But only if it were to bring a peace,
till the spring at least.

30:04.480 --> 30:06.000
[Pyrlig] Edward needs time.

30:06.080 --> 30:09.400
My father's sickness has cast a shadow.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.320
And I, uh...

30:11.840 --> 30:13.960
I'm not yet ready to...

30:14.040 --> 30:15.160
[exhales] bring light.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.880
Cometh the hour.

30:18.640 --> 30:22.280
I fear a great battle now
would have only one outcome, defeat.

30:22.840 --> 30:26.040
But if we were able to weaken the Danes
as Uhtred has suggested--

30:26.720 --> 30:28.560
We need to hear more of his plan.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.200
Forgive me.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.000
There is nothing to forgive, Lord.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.440
You have the wisdom of a king.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.360
Should I bring him to you? Uhtred?

30:39.920 --> 30:42.280
We could all at least listen.
He does plan well.

30:42.360 --> 30:43.600
[stutters] Yes. Do that.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.160
You are going to fetch him now?

30:46.240 --> 30:47.720
Yes, Lord.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.600
I should meet him privately. Where?

30:52.440 --> 30:53.800
Thinking on it, Lord,

30:53.880 --> 30:58.200
may I suggest you meet him in clear sight,
as though nothing is secret nor hidden?

31:03.480 --> 31:04.840
[Aethelred] She shames me

31:04.920 --> 31:07.120
with every breath
that she continues to take.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.280
There are more pressing matters, Lord.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.560
You continue to defend her, Aldhelm.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.400
It has not gone unnoticed.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.520
[Aldhelm] My concern is Mercia
and Aethelred.

31:18.600 --> 31:19.960
Always.

31:21.320 --> 31:22.400
What's this?

31:25.600 --> 31:27.800
Who does Edward imagine himself to be?

31:35.640 --> 31:37.720
I came to sit with my sister for a while.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.440
My sister, the outlaw.

31:40.520 --> 31:42.560
You grow by the day, Edward.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.720
He grows wiser.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.560
Slowly, but hopefully.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.760
If you would excuse me.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.720
I was sorry to hear of Ragnar's death.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.600
He was a heathen, but a good man.
I shall pray for him.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.520
Amen.

32:02.240 --> 32:05.120
He would not thank you
for your prayers, Father.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.840
Well, they are his all the same.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.400
I pray for you, too, Uhtred.

32:09.480 --> 32:12.080
And I will not stop,
in spite of your pigheadedness.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.840
And me, Father?

32:15.520 --> 32:17.840
Oh, I'm afraid you belong
to the devil already.

32:17.920 --> 32:19.440
Hmm. You could well be right.

32:21.600 --> 32:24.080
Should we get on with the matter,
Father Beocca?

32:24.160 --> 32:25.800
Sooner we get back, the better.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.320
Yes. Edward is here...

32:29.120 --> 32:31.600
because he has something to say, to ask.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.880
For the sake of appearances,
you should all try to behave

32:35.960 --> 32:37.880
as if you're completely disinterested.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.320
How... how many men does Haesten have?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.040
Maybe as many as 1,000.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.400
And a fortress.

32:54.960 --> 32:56.480
Beamfleot.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.440
[Edward] I wish to understand why

33:00.520 --> 33:03.880
you believe you can defeat him
when it appears impossible.

33:11.480 --> 33:14.160
Laying siege to the fortress
would take 3,000

33:14.240 --> 33:15.640
and many would die.

33:16.640 --> 33:19.440
But I would use his hatred of me
to draw him out.

33:19.880 --> 33:23.320
We could feint an attack with
a small number of men and then retreat.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.600
Haesten will not be able to resist
the opportunity of killing me.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.760
On open ground, with an army,
we will have a chance.

33:30.640 --> 33:32.360
Men will still die.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.400
It is war.

33:34.480 --> 33:38.040
Men will die at Beamfleot
or they will die here, and at Winchester.

33:38.400 --> 33:39.720
But as I said to the king,

33:39.800 --> 33:42.320
defeating Haesten
could well prevent a greater war.

33:42.400 --> 33:44.720
[Finan] And that is no false claim, Lord.

33:44.800 --> 33:48.280
Nothing deters a warrior more
than the news of defeat.

33:49.040 --> 33:51.680
It's a plan that can work,
but Uhtred will need men.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.800
An army.

33:54.520 --> 33:57.080
And I do not wish the devil
to take me too easily.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.760
There's a thick forest
surrounding Beamfleot.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.880
A good place to hide an army.

34:02.960 --> 34:04.480
[Uhtred] Yes, Lord.

34:04.560 --> 34:07.960
A good place to hide 500 men, or more?

34:09.320 --> 34:10.600
Then you shall have them.

34:12.760 --> 34:16.560
-Is that a promise you can keep, Lord?
-It is, or I can never be called king.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.719
Edward, you are certain?

34:22.800 --> 34:25.320
Set a day for the attack
and I will be there.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.320
You shall have the men.

34:29.280 --> 34:30.880
Draw Haesten out of the fort.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.639
Our army will be hidden
in the woods, waiting.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.320
You have my word.

34:36.840 --> 34:37.880
I swear.

34:53.960 --> 34:55.760
[Steapa] Open the gates.

34:57.640 --> 34:58.720
[gates opening]

35:04.080 --> 35:05.160
[horse whinnies]

35:08.640 --> 35:12.200
You cannot do what you have promised
without the approval from the king.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.880
[sighs] I will speak to him.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.840
Do not leave it too late.

35:18.800 --> 35:21.960
If he denies you, leave time
to ask him again and again.

35:23.600 --> 35:24.440
To beg?

35:25.960 --> 35:27.280
If needed, yes.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.080
It was cold, so I lit a fire.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.520
I hope you don't mind.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.600
We have servants to light fires.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.320
Come. Sit.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.400
I do not have an appetite.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.440
When will you return to Wincelcumb?

36:12.520 --> 36:14.720
Oh, I have no plans to return.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.840
I have assigned my guard to Uhtred,

36:17.920 --> 36:20.200
and will remain here to go with my husband

36:20.280 --> 36:22.320
and the men of Mercia into battle.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.120
May I say...

36:27.520 --> 36:31.160
you did not appear concerned...

36:32.240 --> 36:34.320
nor surprised, Lord,

36:34.400 --> 36:36.800
at Haesten's attempt to kill your wife.

36:38.320 --> 36:39.320
[gasps]

36:43.440 --> 36:45.680
Does my reaction now meet
with your approval?

36:47.080 --> 36:48.080
It does.

36:48.760 --> 36:49.880
Thank you.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.240
My dear...

36:52.320 --> 36:54.520
I assure you that I will not rest

36:54.600 --> 36:56.800
until I find the truth of what happened.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.080
And those responsible shall pay
with their lives.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.920
Haesten, for one,
is directly responsible for the attack.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.880
Why do you not seek to punish him?

37:07.960 --> 37:09.720
Because I'm required here.

37:12.160 --> 37:16.120
My father, too, will seek retribution
and justice. I am sure.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.520
Should he live that long.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.120
[Aethelred inhales deeply]

37:22.240 --> 37:23.680
I pray that he does.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.120
[thuds]

37:30.280 --> 37:32.240
I've found my appetite after all.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.080
I killed this hare myself with an arrow.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.120
You are pleased with more
than the hunting of a hare.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.360
I am.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.240
Alfred is dead
and I sit opposite a vision of beauty.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.960
I belong to another.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.040
He will come.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.920
Soon, I hope.

37:56.000 --> 37:57.760
And like this hare...

37:58.920 --> 38:00.760
will fall by my arrows.

38:03.480 --> 38:05.680
And then he will avenge me, Lord.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.520
All of me.

38:12.120 --> 38:14.240
Who else was witness to this promise?

38:14.320 --> 38:15.320
Is that important?

38:16.040 --> 38:18.080
All that matters is that I gave my word.

38:18.160 --> 38:21.800
[Beocca] Lord, I was there
with the Lady Aethelflaed, Finan,

38:21.880 --> 38:23.560
uh, the boy Sihtric, Osferth.

38:23.640 --> 38:26.280
Some others may have over-heard possibly.

38:26.360 --> 38:28.920
Father, it is a worthy plan.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.200
-I gave my word to Uhtred--
-What you gave was not yours to give!

38:33.000 --> 38:35.040
-[sighs] Father--
-Say nothing.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.840
[sighs]

38:43.600 --> 38:44.440
Father Beocca,

38:45.600 --> 38:48.680
inform Uhtred that Edward
has withdrawn his support.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.320
-But I have not.
-Lord Uhtred has already left camp.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.160
-Then send a messenger.
-Lord King,

38:53.240 --> 38:55.800
Haesten's our enemy.
Attacking is to our advantage--

38:55.880 --> 38:57.880
-Send a messenger!
-It's to my advantage!

38:57.960 --> 38:59.800
I beg you to listen to me!

39:04.120 --> 39:08.360
If Haesten is allowed to join
Cnut and Bloodhair, there will be...

39:09.200 --> 39:10.400
a great battle.

39:12.480 --> 39:15.520
I'm not ready for such a battle,
nor what will follow.

39:17.560 --> 39:19.280
[exhales sharply] I am not a king.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.080
Not yet.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.280
And I fear the aftermath of a great battle

39:25.360 --> 39:27.200
will be a challenge too far.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.200
Lord, I am no warrior, nor strategist.

39:34.960 --> 39:37.520
But if we can defeat
one-third of a great army

39:37.600 --> 39:39.600
before it has the opportunity to gather,

39:40.160 --> 39:41.600
surely that is a good thing.

39:41.680 --> 39:45.000
We would not be marching
to Beamfleot in support of Uhtred,

39:45.720 --> 39:47.560
but to protect the kingdom.

39:49.080 --> 39:52.320
And to delay a greater battle,
and give me time.

39:57.120 --> 40:00.120
Time to become worthy of your crown.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.600
You should have approached me.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.840
But you speak the truth.

40:17.320 --> 40:19.360
You are not yet ready. Far from it.

40:21.240 --> 40:24.560
You gave your word without the means
nor ability to keep it.

40:27.280 --> 40:28.880
[sighs]

40:28.960 --> 40:30.600
Perhaps you will never be ready.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.040
Leave me.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.040
-Father--
-I said leave me.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
[door closes]

41:01.120 --> 41:04.640
Is it possible to be both proud
and feverish with anger?

41:06.240 --> 41:08.760
It is often the way, Lord, with children.

41:08.840 --> 41:12.120
He is his father's son,
of that I have no doubt.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.400
He can become a man to follow, Lord.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.880
Given the opportunity.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.240
[sighs]

41:24.880 --> 41:26.360
[Steapa] Gather your weapons!

41:27.920 --> 41:31.040
Off your arses now
and gather your weapons!

41:31.800 --> 41:34.040
-Gather your weapons!
-[Edward] Steapa?

41:35.640 --> 41:37.960
We march, Lord, to Beamfleot.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.720
Come on! Make ready. We march!

41:42.840 --> 41:44.800
Come on! Move yourselves!

41:49.800 --> 41:50.840
[inhales sharply]

41:53.480 --> 41:56.320
It has grown heavier these past weeks.

41:58.200 --> 41:59.520
I will manage.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.520
[breathes deeply]

42:41.520 --> 42:45.160
God willing, this will be the last
of both Alfred and Edward.

42:48.760 --> 42:50.480
You disagree, Aldhelm?

42:51.320 --> 42:52.480
They know my God, Lord.

42:53.640 --> 42:54.760
The Danes do not.

42:57.320 --> 42:58.320
Long live the king!

43:00.000 --> 43:03.520
-Long live the king!
-[men cheering]

43:04.560 --> 43:06.600
[all chanting] Long live the king!

43:07.200 --> 43:08.920
Long live the king!

43:09.000 --> 43:10.760
Long live the king!

43:11.680 --> 43:13.400
Long live the king!

43:14.040 --> 43:15.480
Long live the king!

43:16.160 --> 43:18.120
Long live the king!

43:18.200 --> 43:19.960
Long live the king!

43:20.040 --> 43:22.000
[chanting continues]

43:31.840 --> 43:33.720
Are you not going with them, my dear?

43:36.360 --> 43:38.880
My place is in Mercia, Lord.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.960
[chanting continues]

43:51.720 --> 43:53.360
[speaking indistinctly]

43:53.440 --> 43:54.800
-[whistles]
-[grunting]

44:01.720 --> 44:03.520
-[shushes]
-[grunting]

44:03.600 --> 44:05.400
[Finan] You are a lucky man.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.600
You will go back to Haesten

44:07.680 --> 44:10.760
and tell him exactly
what you have seen here.

44:10.840 --> 44:13.400
-Agreed?
-Yes.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.640
Yes.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.920
[Haesten] Uhtred has finally arrived
to claim you.

44:23.000 --> 44:24.520
As you said he would.

44:25.360 --> 44:26.680
With how many men?

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
Not more than 30.

44:28.440 --> 44:29.560
That is all?

44:29.640 --> 44:31.720
[chuckles] Thirty, fifty.

44:31.800 --> 44:35.560
All he can do is
try to creep over the walls.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.920
So when he moves,

44:38.600 --> 44:40.800
I will have his balls. [chuckles]

44:41.480 --> 44:43.880
-Thirty men is nothing.
-He's no longer a lord.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.880
He has no men, no silver, no land.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.760
-Then be sure to win me, Lord.
-[chuckles]

44:51.320 --> 44:53.400
And be sure to gift me prisoners.

44:54.360 --> 44:57.280
I have not seen a man beg for mercy
for some time.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.560
[sighs]

45:09.000 --> 45:10.400
[horn blows]

45:35.920 --> 45:39.240
The great Lord Uhtred and his army.

45:40.760 --> 45:43.560
Ready the archers
and prepare every last man.

45:43.640 --> 45:46.120
The Dane-slayer shall die
this very morning.

45:46.960 --> 45:48.120
[Dagfinn] Yes, Lord.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.120
[Haesten] Lord Uhtred!

45:51.200 --> 45:52.840
Such a frightening sight.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.920
You are a coward, Haesten.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.840
Hiding inside your fortress.

45:56.920 --> 46:00.320
When the priests of Eoferwic did rise,
you fled?

46:00.400 --> 46:02.840
When Sigefrid attacked Alfred, you fled.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.160
And at the nunnery, once again, you fled.

46:08.040 --> 46:09.840
I took your woman!

46:09.920 --> 46:14.000
And as long as I live and breathe,
she still is my woman.

46:14.560 --> 46:17.520
Fight me!
I'll wait for you in the clearing there.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.040
Bring a guard and no more.

46:19.120 --> 46:22.040
Let us make the square
and let the two of us fight.

46:22.120 --> 46:25.000
[Haesten] That is what you want, Uhtred,
to die?

46:25.080 --> 46:27.680
[Uhtred] What I want is an end to this.

46:27.760 --> 46:30.880
What is most likely to happen
is you will remain a coward.

46:30.960 --> 46:33.320
You will remain inside your fortress.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.920
[men laughing]

46:35.000 --> 46:38.040
Songs will be sung about your cowardice.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.120
-I shall pay for them to be written.
-[men laughing]

46:41.200 --> 46:44.240
I am no coward, Dane-slayer!

46:44.320 --> 46:46.240
If death is what you want,

46:46.320 --> 46:47.880
then you shall have it!

46:52.040 --> 46:53.720
[Finan] Lord, the job is done.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.200
It's been half a day.

47:40.720 --> 47:41.920
[sighs]

47:42.480 --> 47:44.120
Maybe he's scared of the priest.

47:46.680 --> 47:47.880
We leave!

47:55.320 --> 47:56.440
[softly] Lord.

47:56.520 --> 47:57.520
Lord!

47:57.600 --> 47:58.560
[panting] Lord!

47:59.800 --> 48:01.120
Lord!

-We've no ground to give, Lord.

49:42.480 --> 49:43.800
Give up Uhtred,

49:43.880 --> 49:45.520
and the rest of you will live.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.160
All I want is the Dane-slayer!

49:48.240 --> 49:52.520
What you will get, Haesten,
is my sword up your hairy arse.

49:52.600 --> 49:54.200
[chuckles]

49:54.280 --> 49:55.440
As you wish.

You will die on your knees!

Lord, where is Alfred's army?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.120
Why are they waiting?

50:03.200 --> 50:06.240
I want the head

50:51.800 --> 50:53.880
Not one man is to live!

Lord?

51:40.400 --> 51:42.320
We cannot just stand by

51:42.400 --> 51:45.200
-and watch them die!
-What would Uhtred do?

51:45.280 --> 51:47.560
He'd allow his enemies
to destroy one another.

51:47.640 --> 51:50.040
-I gave him my word!
-Then what will you do, boy?

51:50.120 --> 51:52.760
You can either bleat
or you can make a decision!

51:54.480 --> 51:55.480
What will you do?
