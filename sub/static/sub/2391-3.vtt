I WANTED TO SEE FOR MYSELF
THAT YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.

36:29.880 --> 36:32.542
WELL, I'M NOT,
ACTUALLY, OKAY?

36:32.950 --> 36:34.383
I'M NOT.

36:34.390 --> 36:36.585
TURNS OUT MY MOM'S A LIAR.

36:36.590 --> 36:39.388
AND MY FATHER
IS A CIRCUS FREAK.

36:39.390 --> 36:41.597
JUSTIN.
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.989
THIS IS SOMETHING I HAD TO DO.

36:44.000 --> 36:46.924
THIS...IS WHO I AM.

36:46.930 --> 36:50.297
COME ON, VERONICA.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

36:50.300 --> 36:51.801
[ SOBS ]

36:54.640 --> 36:57.905
IT WAS NICE MEETING EVERYONE.

37:06.950 --> 37:09.657
90 MILES.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.785
WHAT'S 90 MILES?

37:14.730 --> 37:17.756
IT'S THE DISTANCE
YOUR DAD TRAVELS EVERY WEEK

37:17.760 --> 37:20.820
TO SEE YOU
FOR A FEW SECONDS.

37:27.570 --> 37:29.572
LOOK, MY MOM'S
BEEN MISSING, TOO.

37:29.580 --> 37:32.970
AND HONESTLY,
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING

37:32.980 --> 37:36.848
TO FEEL THAT SHE CARED ENOUGH
ABOUT ME TO DO THAT.

37:44.990 --> 37:47.322
Veronica:
IF SHE WASN'T GOING TO FIND ME,

37:47.330 --> 37:49.719
I WAS GOING TO HAVE TO FIND HER.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.989
I'VE DECIDED TO DRIVE TO ARIZONA
AFTER SCHOOL.

37:53.000 --> 37:56.731
IF THE ROADS ARE CLEAR, I CAN
MAKE IT THERE IN FOUR HOURS.

38:00.140 --> 38:02.836
TRAGEDY BLOWS THROUGH YOUR LIFE
LIKE A TORNADO,

38:02.840 --> 38:06.606
UPROOTING EVERYTHING,
CREATING CHAOS.

38:06.610 --> 38:10.410
YOU WAIT FOR THE DUST TO SETTLE,
AND THEN YOU CHOOSE.

38:28.200 --> 38:29.667
YOU CAN LIVE IN THE WRECKAGE

38:39.210 --> 38:40.848
HEY.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.909
HOW'S YOUR HEAD?

38:44.950 --> 38:46.087
BETTER.

38:48.820 --> 38:52.551
OR YOU CAN CRAWL FROM THE RUBBLE
AND SLOWLY REBUILD.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.926
HEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CAME HERE.

38:54.930 --> 38:56.898
YEAH.
I JUST DISCOVERED THIS PLACE.

38:56.900 --> 38:57.992
YEAH.
ME TOO.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.161
OH.
HOW HAVE WE MISSED EACH OTHER?

39:00.170 --> 39:01.797
[ LAUGHS ]

39:01.800 --> 39:04.405
JUSTIN, DID YOU SPECIAL-ORDER
"BODY HEAT" FOR SOMEONE?

39:04.410 --> 39:06.628
BECAUSE AFTER DISASTER STRIKES,

39:06.640 --> 39:09.200
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS THAT YOU MOVE ON.

39:09.210 --> 39:10.905
RIGHT.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.874
HELLO?

39:15.080 --> 39:16.308
JULIA?

39:16.320 --> 39:17.514
IT'S JUSTIN.

39:17.950 --> 39:21.454
HEY, LISTEN. THAT COPY OF
"BODY HEAT" YOU WANTED CAME IN.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.522
NO. IT --
NO. I-IT'S FINE.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.828
YEAH.
I-I WORK HERE EVERY SATURDAY.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.088
THAT'S GREAT.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.351
OKAY.

39:31.730 --> 39:34.221
I'LL SEE YOU THEN.

39:34.230 --> 39:35.868
BYE.

39:39.070 --> 39:43.973
BUT IF YOU'RE LIKE ME,
YOU JUST KEEP CHASING THE STORM.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.157
MOM?

39:56.760 --> 39:58.489
MOM?

40:00.030 --> 40:01.850
MOM?

40:02.260 --> 40:04.125
CAN I HELP YOU?

40:05.800 --> 40:08.439
I'M LOOKING FOR LIANNE MARS.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.237
VERONICA?

40:10.240 --> 40:11.264
YEAH.

40:11.270 --> 40:12.931
I'M ADRIANNA.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.999
I'M A COLLEGE FRIEND
OF YOUR MOM'S.

40:15.010 --> 40:16.102
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU.

40:16.110 --> 40:18.169
YOUR MOTHER TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME.

40:18.180 --> 40:19.249
WHERE IS SHE?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.514
SHE LEFT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.287
WELL, DID SHE SAY
WHERE SHE WAS GOING?

40:26.290 --> 40:28.087
NO.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.583
DON'T LIE TO ME.

40:30.590 --> 40:33.150
[Voice breaking ]
I NEED TO KNOW.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.627
WHERE IS SHE?

40:34.630 --> 40:36.097
SHE THOUGHT YOUR FATHER
MIGHT COME LOOKING FOR HER,

40:36.100 --> 40:39.024
AND SHE KNOWS I'M NO GOOD
AT KEEPING SECRETS.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.093
DOESN'T SHE CARE ABOUT ME?

40:42.100 --> 40:45.035
YOU'RE ALL SHE CARES ABOUT.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.999
MARK ME DOWN AS SKEPTICAL.

40:57.780 --> 41:01.557
THE PROBLEM WITH CHASING THE
STORM IS THAT IT WEARS YOU DOWN,

41:01.560 --> 41:03.482
BREAKS YOUR SPIRIT.

41:04.260 --> 41:08.526
EVEN THE EXPERTS AGREE --
A GIRL NEEDS CLOSURE.

41:25.010 --> 41:26.568
HI.

41:26.580 --> 41:28.514
I'M OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE.

41:49.500 --> 41:51.559
IT'S ABOUT TIME.
