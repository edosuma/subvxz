01:01.593 --> 01:02.826
Thank you.

01:02.861 --> 01:04.394
All right, gentlemen.
What do we have here?

01:04.429 --> 01:06.597
Looks like a drive-by
outside a neighborhood bar.

01:06.631 --> 01:07.932
Lots of 7.62 casings,

01:07.966 --> 01:09.833
probably from an AK-47.

01:09.868 --> 01:13.003
We have three male
African-American victims.

01:13.038 --> 01:15.706
Two dead here, third guy died
on his way to the hospital.

01:15.740 --> 01:17.775
There are over 100 patrons
of this nightclub

01:17.809 --> 01:19.043
holed up inside.

01:19.077 --> 01:21.111
I thought it would be better
to interview them downtown,

01:21.146 --> 01:23.180
so I've got buses coming in
to pick them up.

01:23.214 --> 01:24.481
Thank you, Lieutenant.

01:24.516 --> 01:27.251
Just, uh, make sure
we don't let anything slip by.

01:27.285 --> 01:28.919
Thank you.
All right, Detective.

01:28.954 --> 01:29.920
What gang are we
dealing with here?

01:29.955 --> 01:31.822
In between territories,
Chief.

01:31.856 --> 01:33.490
Maywoods to the North,

01:33.525 --> 01:34.658
Rolling 50s to the South.

01:34.693 --> 01:37.361
It's kind of a neutral area
gang-wise,

01:37.395 --> 01:39.463
so it's hard to say
who might be responsible.

01:39.497 --> 01:42.166
Do we have any idea
what time this all went down?

01:42.200 --> 01:44.535
Uh, the victims left the club
around 1:00 A.M.

01:44.569 --> 01:46.537
That's when a dark blue
or black sedan

01:46.571 --> 01:47.538
drove down the street.

01:47.572 --> 01:48.872
The, uh, the manager,

01:48.907 --> 01:50.874
who was outside
having a cigarette at the time,

01:50.909 --> 01:53.177
said he heard the shooter
yell, "What up, T-ball?"

01:53.211 --> 01:54.311
Before he opened fire.

01:54.346 --> 01:56.480
We're running "T-ball"
through our database now.

01:56.514 --> 01:59.183
Did the manager know of any
arguments from inside the club?

01:59.217 --> 02:00.884
No, he said
it was a mellow night.

02:00.919 --> 02:02.419
We checked
security cameras.

02:02.454 --> 02:03.554
They don't have any.

02:03.588 --> 02:05.656
One of the reasons why
this place is so popular.

02:05.690 --> 02:06.790
Splendid.

02:06.825 --> 02:07.791
Sorry you had to wait.

02:07.826 --> 02:09.026
I'm the only guy
on tonight.

02:09.060 --> 02:10.526
I'll be out of your way
in a sec.

02:10.562 --> 02:13.197
All right, Lieutenant.
What do we have here?

02:13.231 --> 02:15.232
Chief, that victim
tried crawling away.

02:15.266 --> 02:17.334
This one...

02:17.369 --> 02:19.403
Never had a chance.

02:21.773 --> 02:23.741
And, uh, that's what's left
of the one who died

02:23.775 --> 02:25.342
on the way
to the hospital.

02:29.214 --> 02:31.215
What is it, Detective?

02:31.249 --> 02:33.317
I'm not sure, Chief.

02:33.351 --> 02:36.086
They don't look
like gangsters.

02:36.121 --> 02:38.689
This guy's wearing
Army dog tags.

02:38.723 --> 02:39.623
What?

02:49.467 --> 02:51.502
This one too.

02:51.536 --> 02:54.405
These men are soldiers.

02:57.475 --> 02:59.576
Chief. Chief.

02:59.611 --> 03:01.178
Turns out the third victim
is alive.

03:01.212 --> 03:02.579
Where?

03:02.614 --> 03:04.515
County General. They're trying
to stabilize him now.

03:04.549 --> 03:05.849
Lieutenant Tao,

03:05.884 --> 03:07.484
when y'all interview with
the people from the club,

03:07.519 --> 03:08.986
we need to keep the facts
to ourselves.

03:09.020 --> 03:10.354
Just find out
if anyone from inside

03:10.388 --> 03:11.955
knows about these murders.
Yes, ma'am.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.524
And let's get
these bodies removed

03:13.558 --> 03:15.426
before anyone else
has a chance to see them.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.860
Detective Gabriel,
please call Chief Pope.

03:16.895 --> 03:19.430
Let him know I need to speak
with him as soon as possible.

03:19.464 --> 03:21.498
And, Lieutenant Flynn,
contact the Army.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.634
Don't give away any details,
but tell them I need

03:23.668 --> 03:25.636
a military representative
to meet with us tonight.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.271
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.348
Guy flatlined three times
in the ambulance.

03:38.383 --> 03:40.350
The EMT had given up
by the time we got here.

03:40.385 --> 03:41.652
Then out of nowhere,

03:41.686 --> 03:43.687
the guy coughs, and now
they're working on him again.

03:43.722 --> 03:44.788
He's in here.

03:44.823 --> 03:46.890
Thank you.

03:46.925 --> 03:48.058
Is he conscious?

03:48.093 --> 03:49.259
Barely.

03:49.294 --> 03:50.828
I-I need to ask him
some questions.

03:50.862 --> 03:51.829
Just don't get
in our way.

03:51.863 --> 03:53.397
What -- what's his name?

03:53.431 --> 03:55.833
Dog tags
are on the tray.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.172
Mr. Baylor?

04:03.875 --> 04:06.410
Mr. Baylor,
I'm a police officer.

04:06.444 --> 04:08.412
I want to ask you
some questions.

04:08.446 --> 04:10.781
Ty, look at me.
Can you hear me?

04:10.815 --> 04:12.349
He can't speak.
His lungs have collapsed.

04:12.383 --> 04:14.451
Ty, I want to find out
who did this to you.

04:14.486 --> 04:16.452
I'm gonna ask you
some questions, and --

04:16.488 --> 04:17.721
ugh.
Spin an "h" and "h."

04:17.755 --> 04:19.089
He's got
a bilateral hemothorax.

04:19.124 --> 04:21.591
We've got 400cc
in the chest tube.

04:22.627 --> 04:24.561
I want you
to squeeze my hand. Okay?

04:24.596 --> 04:26.196
Squeeze once for "yes"
and twice for "no."

04:26.231 --> 04:27.231
Can you do that?

04:28.299 --> 04:29.800
Good. Good.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.368
Did you see
who shot at you?

04:31.402 --> 04:32.936
He's bradying down.

04:32.971 --> 04:34.271
D-do you know why
you were shot?

04:35.340 --> 04:37.207
Did it have something to do
with your military service?

04:37.242 --> 04:38.776
He's lost his pulse again.
Ty?

04:38.810 --> 04:40.077
Go! Go!
We have to open up now!

04:40.111 --> 04:42.412
Ty, did it have anything to do
with your military service?

04:42.447 --> 04:43.614
Let's go!

04:43.648 --> 04:45.282
Coming through.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.292
<i>...Team to ICU, please.</i>

04:55.326 --> 04:57.227
<i>Blue team, ICU.</i>

05:11.676 --> 05:13.043
Guy didn't make it, huh?

05:13.077 --> 05:14.478
No. Ugh.
No, he didn't.

05:14.512 --> 05:16.446
Let Chief Pope know
I'm here, please.

05:16.481 --> 05:18.415
Uh, he's not in,
and he hasn't called me back.

05:18.449 --> 05:20.117
Well, could you
try him again?

05:20.151 --> 05:23.153
This case could end up having National
Security implications,

05:23.188 --> 05:24.655
and I-I may need
his help.

05:24.689 --> 05:25.789
Thank you.

05:31.362 --> 05:33.397
Okay, folks.
Here they are.

05:33.431 --> 05:34.832
Chief.

05:34.866 --> 05:37.968
Three members
of the U.S. Army Rangers.

05:38.002 --> 05:39.303
Sergeant Willy Ogedi.

05:39.337 --> 05:41.538
He's from Tulsa, 22.

05:41.573 --> 05:43.440
We have
Sergeant Lance Riggs.

05:43.474 --> 05:46.276
He's 23, from Detroit.

05:46.311 --> 05:47.644
And, uh,
here's the young man

05:47.679 --> 05:49.146
you went to the hospital
to meet,

05:49.180 --> 05:51.448
Staff Sergeant Ty Baylor,

05:51.482 --> 05:53.083
24, Los Angeles.

05:53.117 --> 05:55.319
Um, as a matter of fact,

05:55.353 --> 05:56.486
he apparently,

05:56.521 --> 05:59.022
uh, was raised
in this area here,

05:59.057 --> 06:01.758
about four miles
from where he was...

06:01.793 --> 06:03.126
Shot to death.

06:03.161 --> 06:05.796
Now, this is the kicker,
everyone.

06:05.830 --> 06:08.031
These three boys
just came home yesterday

06:08.066 --> 06:09.499
from Afghanistan.

06:11.302 --> 06:12.603
Uh, Chief.

06:12.637 --> 06:14.538
We've downloaded 34
of the bar patrons' phones,

06:14.572 --> 06:15.839
so far.

06:15.874 --> 06:18.208
Got three pictures
and a video of our victims

06:18.243 --> 06:19.276
inside the club.

06:21.412 --> 06:23.180
Now, people
we spoke to said

06:23.214 --> 06:25.616
they behaved themselves,

06:25.650 --> 06:27.050
stayed out of trouble.

06:27.085 --> 06:29.686
Detective Gabriel,
you said earlier

06:29.721 --> 06:32.155
that the shooter
called out a name, "T-ball"?

06:32.190 --> 06:34.858
Do we know who
that person is yet?

06:34.893 --> 06:36.693
Yeah. An officer I spoke to
in Newton

06:36.728 --> 06:38.862
said that he knew
of a T-ball

06:38.897 --> 06:40.864
that ran
with the 110 Crips.

06:40.899 --> 06:43.967
110 Crips roll
in Baylor's neighborhood, Chief.

06:44.002 --> 06:47.604
Maybe sergeant Ty Baylor's
moniker was T-ball?

06:47.639 --> 06:50.207
No. He's clean.
No gang background, no record.

06:50.241 --> 06:51.275
Uh, Lieutenant Tao,

06:51.309 --> 06:52.776
did anyone
from inside the club

06:52.810 --> 06:53.944
actually see the bodies?

06:53.978 --> 06:56.446
No. Manager says
whenever he hears gun shots,

06:56.481 --> 06:57.781
he keeps everyone inside

06:57.815 --> 06:59.516
until the police arrive.

06:59.550 --> 07:02.519
Chief?
This is Major Edward Dorcet.

07:02.553 --> 07:05.722
He was contacted
by our military affairs officer.

07:05.757 --> 07:07.891
Uh, Major, this is
Deputy Chief Johnson.

07:07.926 --> 07:09.226
Pleasure, ma'am.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.362
Um, is there someplace
that we could talk privately?

07:13.598 --> 07:15.899
Thank you so much for coming in,
Major Dorcet.

07:15.934 --> 07:18.535
I'm assuming that the FBI
has been notified, as well.

07:20.672 --> 07:22.906
We haven't determined
if this is a Federal crime.

07:22.941 --> 07:24.007
But as soon as we do --

07:24.042 --> 07:25.509
Chief Johnson...

07:25.543 --> 07:28.211
Three members of the
United States military are dead.

07:28.246 --> 07:30.314
I'm aware of that.

07:30.348 --> 07:32.482
And so you may also be aware
that we are potentially

07:32.517 --> 07:34.518
looking at
a terrorist act here.

07:34.552 --> 07:35.986
There are people
who need to be notified.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.021
Look, Major, I asked you here,
in person,

07:38.056 --> 07:39.890
because I'm going to need
your help.

07:39.924 --> 07:41.925
Right now,
we need to treat these murders

07:41.960 --> 07:43.493
<i>exactly</i> like
a gang drive-by.

07:43.528 --> 07:45.228
It is very, very important

07:45.263 --> 07:47.597
that you don't give any
information to your superiors --

07:47.632 --> 07:50.233
excuse me, but I have three
important objectives here.

07:50.268 --> 07:52.869
First, I have to notify
the Department of Defense

07:52.904 --> 07:55.072
in case this shooting
was a terrorist attack

07:55.106 --> 07:56.239
on our soldiers.

07:56.274 --> 07:58.442
Then I must make sure
that the person responsible

07:58.476 --> 07:59.743
is apprehended,

07:59.777 --> 08:02.346
and the families of these men
need to be notified.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.348
Chief Johnson.

08:04.382 --> 08:06.016
What is it, commander?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.217
There's a guy here

08:07.251 --> 08:08.852
claiming to have information
on these murders.

08:08.886 --> 08:10.087
Well, where is he?

08:10.121 --> 08:12.289
He doesn't want to come
into the murder room.

08:12.323 --> 08:14.491
Too many eyes between here
and the elevator.

08:19.764 --> 08:22.299
Would you contact
our official FBI liaison

08:22.333 --> 08:24.634
and alert him to my situation
with Major Dorcet?

08:24.669 --> 08:26.370
You got it, Chief.

08:31.242 --> 08:33.477
Chief Johnson,
this is Turell,

08:33.510 --> 08:36.546
Sergeant Ty Baylor's
twin brother.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.220
You must be T-ball.

08:53.463 --> 08:55.383
Turell Baylor. Also known as T-ball.

08:55.509 --> 08:57.944
Spent two years in juvie
for armed robbery.

08:57.978 --> 09:00.580
As an adult, he served 90 days
on a gun possession,

09:00.614 --> 09:02.415
was arrested twice
for narcotics,

09:02.450 --> 09:04.084
but no charges were filed,
Chief.

09:04.118 --> 09:05.785
This guy's
been an active member

09:05.820 --> 09:08.722
of the 110 Crips
since he was 15 years old.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.323
None of that
changes anything.

09:10.357 --> 09:11.658
And everything about
these murders says "gangs."

09:11.692 --> 09:13.460
Major, it's pretty clear

09:13.494 --> 09:15.995
that whoever shot these men
was aiming at the wrong brother.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.630
And when you have
proof of that,

09:17.665 --> 09:18.732
I'll be out of your hair.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.500
But at this point,

09:20.534 --> 09:22.268
I have standing orders to report
these murders to the D.O.D.

09:22.303 --> 09:24.504
And confirm that this was not
a terrorist attack.

09:24.538 --> 09:26.039
Beyond that, I must see

09:26.073 --> 09:29.576
that the responsible party,
or parties, are apprehended.

09:29.610 --> 09:30.810
Also, the families
of these men

09:30.845 --> 09:32.512
deserve to know
what happened to them.

09:32.546 --> 09:34.147
Sir, the minute
you report this,

09:34.181 --> 09:36.349
the killer will find out
he shot the wrong man.

09:36.383 --> 09:37.984
And when
this goes public,

09:38.018 --> 09:41.187
I will lose the <i>only</i>
<i>tactical advantage I have.</i>

09:41.222 --> 09:44.090
Look, Major, you want to run
and tell your superiors

09:44.125 --> 09:45.925
the sky is falling,
go ahead.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.827
But it's not gonna look good
for you

09:47.862 --> 09:50.630
when Homeland Security
raises the threat level

09:50.664 --> 09:52.232
and it turns out your guys

09:52.266 --> 09:55.101
were just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.636
Maybe you're unfamiliar

09:56.670 --> 09:59.539
with what happened
in Little Rock last year,

09:59.573 --> 10:00.607
or Fort Hood.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.442
But these attacks
on our soldiers

10:02.476 --> 10:04.110
are not uncommon.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.779
Our active-duty personnel
need to --

10:05.813 --> 10:08.248
no -- they <i>deserve</i> to be alerted
to the potential

10:08.282 --> 10:09.516
for more acts of violence.

10:09.550 --> 10:12.385
Major, my father was an
Air Force officer for 25 years,

10:12.419 --> 10:14.854
and I was born
on a military base.

10:14.889 --> 10:17.357
And -- and -- and tonight
I held Ty Baylor's hand

10:17.391 --> 10:18.558
as he died.

10:18.592 --> 10:21.161
Believe me, no one is
more committed to finding out

10:21.195 --> 10:22.395
who did this than I am.

10:22.429 --> 10:24.297
Just give me 15 minutes,

10:24.331 --> 10:26.766
let me go in there and talk
to Sergeant Baylor's brother

10:26.801 --> 10:29.335
and see if I can't nail down
exactly what happened tonight.

10:30.905 --> 10:33.072
Just 15 minutes, please.

10:34.742 --> 10:36.876
Tell me how you found out

10:36.911 --> 10:38.444
about your brother
being shot, Turell.

10:38.479 --> 10:40.113
My cellie
was getting blown up,

10:40.147 --> 10:41.347
getting texts from fools

10:41.382 --> 10:43.616
thinking I was the one
who got hit out there.

10:43.651 --> 10:46.119
Thing is, people gotta go on
thinking that,

10:46.153 --> 10:47.787
or they're gonna
try again.

10:47.822 --> 10:49.489
Or they're gonna go
after my family, instead.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.491
That's why I want
protection.

10:52.560 --> 10:53.893
Protection?

10:53.928 --> 10:55.628
Police protection.
Can you do that?

10:55.663 --> 10:57.497
'Cause they killed my brother
on accident.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.098
I was the dude
who they was after.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.235
<i>Uh...</i>

11:02.269 --> 11:03.636
Are you in a gang, Turell?

11:03.671 --> 11:04.871
What you think, homes?

11:06.106 --> 11:09.342
What makes you believe you were
the intended victim tonight,

11:09.376 --> 11:10.577
and not your brother?

11:10.611 --> 11:12.312
Ty? No.

11:12.346 --> 11:14.214
<i>Everyone</i> likes Ty.

11:14.248 --> 11:15.682
Yeah, he joined up
with the Army,

11:15.716 --> 11:17.050
bought his ticket
out of here.

11:17.084 --> 11:19.352
Hmm.
But you stayed behind.

11:19.386 --> 11:20.653
Chose the life.
You know.

11:20.688 --> 11:22.155
That's why it's me
they after.

11:22.189 --> 11:24.757
And it ain't like tonight has
been the first time, neither.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.559
Someone's tried
to kill you before?

11:26.594 --> 11:28.027
A few days ago.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.062
Thursday.

11:29.096 --> 11:32.031
Tell me.
Wherdid this happen?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.467
I was on 59th.

11:34.501 --> 11:36.636
59th and what?

11:38.205 --> 11:40.506
If you want my help, you're
gonna have to be more specific.

11:40.541 --> 11:42.942
<i>I was coming up</i>
<i>on Crocker, I guess.</i>

11:44.211 --> 11:45.645
<i>It was like 4:00</i>
<i>in the afternoon,</i>

11:45.679 --> 11:48.414
and this dude rolls up
in a black Cutlass,

11:48.449 --> 11:49.816
just unloads on me.

11:49.850 --> 11:50.884
The manager told us

11:50.918 --> 11:52.485
that the car
in the club drive-by tonight

11:52.519 --> 11:53.987
<i>was</i> dark blue or black.

11:54.021 --> 11:55.088
I dropped behind
some trash cans,

11:55.122 --> 11:56.756
heard the shots popping
all around.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.925
He took off.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.127
I boned out, hit the first alley
I could find.

12:03.464 --> 12:05.899
Show us exactly where.

12:17.311 --> 12:18.544
Buzz.

12:19.580 --> 12:20.914
Chief, it's legit.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.883
There was a radio call for shots
fired at 59th and Crocker

12:23.918 --> 12:25.118
for 4:15 P.M.

12:25.152 --> 12:26.119
On Thursday.

12:26.153 --> 12:27.186
All right.

12:27.221 --> 12:28.588
We're gonna send
a few detectives there,

12:28.622 --> 12:29.789
see if we can confirm
your story.

12:29.823 --> 12:31.224
Okay,
you got this, Sanchez.

12:31.258 --> 12:33.226
Grab Tao
on your way out.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.628
Bring back a bullet
that matches the bullets

12:35.663 --> 12:37.096
fired at our soldiers,
please.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.134
<i>While we wait on that,</i>

12:41.168 --> 12:43.202
why don't you tell me why you think
someone's trying to kill you?

12:47.541 --> 12:50.343
There was a store.
All right?

12:50.377 --> 12:53.079
It was nearby where I lived.
Been there forever.

12:53.113 --> 12:55.381
Everyone knows
it's off limits.

12:55.416 --> 12:57.650
Like, you don't steal so much as a candy bar
from this place.

12:57.685 --> 12:58.651
You feel me?

12:58.686 --> 13:00.553
A few weeks ago,

13:00.587 --> 13:02.155
it got robbed
and a couple people got killed.

13:02.189 --> 13:03.656
And you were a witness?

13:03.691 --> 13:05.058
Can't say.

13:05.092 --> 13:07.994
Where did you say
this T-ball lived again?

13:08.028 --> 13:09.228
Newton.

13:10.597 --> 13:13.800
Tell her he's talking about
the shootin' Newton murders.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.369
She'll know what you mean.

13:16.403 --> 13:17.971
Chief...

13:18.005 --> 13:20.373
He's talking about
the shootin' Newton murders.

13:20.407 --> 13:21.975
I think I know the case
you're talking about.

13:22.009 --> 13:24.110
You do?

13:24.144 --> 13:26.079
There was a double murder at a convenience store
in your neighborhood.

13:26.113 --> 13:28.481
The 74-year-old owner
was shot to death,

13:28.515 --> 13:30.016
along with
his 8-year-old grandson.

13:30.050 --> 13:32.151
<i>Yeah, that's the one.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

13:32.186 --> 13:35.021
Why don't you tell me what you know about
these murders, Turell?

13:35.055 --> 13:37.523
Not until I know
you're gonna protect us --

13:37.558 --> 13:39.792
me and <i>my</i> family.
Look, you answer our questions first, okay?

13:39.827 --> 13:42.161
No, my mom
and my sister first!

13:43.163 --> 13:45.465
Okay, just...

13:45.499 --> 13:46.532
Please!

13:46.567 --> 13:48.468
My brother's already dead
'cause of me.

13:51.138 --> 13:52.472
Okay.

13:53.774 --> 13:55.875
We're gonna send someone
out there to pick them up.

13:55.909 --> 13:58.111
2623 Holly.
Is that correct?

13:58.145 --> 13:59.245
Yeah.
Yeah, that's my spot.

13:59.279 --> 14:00.546
Detective Gabriel,

14:00.581 --> 14:02.715
would you and
Lieutenant Provenza see to it

14:02.750 --> 14:03.783
that Mrs. Baylor
and her daughter

14:03.817 --> 14:04.817
are taken
to a secure location?

14:06.086 --> 14:07.687
Yes, ma'am.

14:13.694 --> 14:16.329
Chief, Newton
was looking at a suspect

14:16.363 --> 14:18.798
named Reggie Moses.

14:22.503 --> 14:24.637
<i>Okay. Your family's</i>
<i>gonna be safe.</i>

14:24.671 --> 14:26.739
Major.

14:26.774 --> 14:29.308
Special Agent Howard,
L.A.P.D.'s FBI liaison.

14:29.343 --> 14:31.244
Thank God.

14:31.278 --> 14:32.945
You have to help me
with this woman.

14:32.980 --> 14:34.480
<i>Why don't you tell me</i>
<i>what you know</i>

14:34.515 --> 14:36.149
<i>about these</i>
<i>convenience store murders,</i>

14:36.183 --> 14:38.317
<i>and maybe we can find the</i>
<i>person who killed your brother?</i>

14:38.352 --> 14:40.453
Should I be looking
at Reggie Moses?

14:43.290 --> 14:45.124
Yeah.

14:45.159 --> 14:46.325
Reggie Moses.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.593
Yeah.

14:47.628 --> 14:48.928
Yeah, he 110 Crip.
Like me.

14:48.962 --> 14:50.863
And why do you think
it was him?

14:52.766 --> 14:54.233
Were you involved somehow?

14:55.769 --> 14:57.670
Look.

14:57.704 --> 15:01.040
I just got to make sure
I ain't gonna get in trouble.

15:01.075 --> 15:02.141
That's all.

15:06.647 --> 15:09.182
That's not a guarantee
I can make at this time.

15:10.651 --> 15:13.019
Why don't you sit tight?

15:24.465 --> 15:25.465
Oh.

15:25.499 --> 15:26.466
Agent Howard.

15:26.500 --> 15:27.900
Nice of you to join us.

15:27.935 --> 15:31.237
Although I'm afraid we may have
called you here for no reason.

15:31.271 --> 15:33.372
Excuse me?
Why is that?

15:33.407 --> 15:35.441
Uh, well, Major,
it seems pretty clear to me

15:35.476 --> 15:37.210
from that interview that we're dealing with
a gang matter here.

15:37.244 --> 15:39.712
And that does not fall
under the purview of the FBI.

15:39.746 --> 15:42.815
Look, all I heard was a story from a frightened kid.
Why aren't you understanding this, Major?

15:42.850 --> 15:44.317
Who might be trying
to save his own skin.

15:44.351 --> 15:46.219
And not only that,
it seems pretty clear

15:46.253 --> 15:48.121
that this T-ball
is holding something back.

15:48.155 --> 15:49.989
I say that you give him
some kind of immunity agreement

15:50.023 --> 15:51.991
so that he tells you
what he knows

15:52.025 --> 15:54.660
without fear of the consequences!
Oh, that is absolutely out of the question.

15:54.695 --> 15:55.895
Major, for all we know,

15:55.929 --> 15:58.331
T-ball and Reggie Moses
robbed that store together.

15:58.365 --> 16:00.299
Then T-ball could be
a corroborating witness

16:00.334 --> 16:01.534
who could put Reggie away,

16:01.568 --> 16:03.269
which would allow me
to at least partially

16:03.303 --> 16:05.505
comply with my standing orders
to report this to --

16:05.539 --> 16:07.006
I need more time
to prove that the --

16:07.040 --> 16:08.441
I just gave you more time.

16:08.475 --> 16:10.009
And I just gave <i>you</i>
<i>a plausible explanation</i>

16:10.043 --> 16:11.010
for what happened.

16:11.044 --> 16:12.912
Please, Major,

16:12.946 --> 16:14.847
I-I-I need --
just give me until noon

16:14.882 --> 16:16.582
to find Reggie Moses.
I can't wait that long.

16:16.617 --> 16:18.317
Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.
Major. Major.

16:19.887 --> 16:22.421
While we let the L.A.P.D.
find this Reggie Moses,

16:22.456 --> 16:24.857
why don't you and I notify
the families of these soldiers?

16:24.892 --> 16:26.359
Now, wait, Chief Johnson,
please.

16:26.393 --> 16:29.162
We will notify the families
of these soldiers

16:29.196 --> 16:30.396
that their sons died
in what may have been

16:30.430 --> 16:31.764
a terrorist attack.

16:31.798 --> 16:34.267
But we will stress that
this information remain secret

16:34.301 --> 16:35.635
until the military
and the FBI

16:35.669 --> 16:38.104
can confirm the nature
of the ongoing threat.

16:38.138 --> 16:40.606
You're asking me to lie.
Wait, wait.

16:40.641 --> 16:42.441
You either think that
this was a terrorist attack

16:42.476 --> 16:44.010
or you don't, Major --
which one is it?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.912
No. Listen.
Speaking for the FBI,

16:45.946 --> 16:48.514
I think we give the L.A.P.D.
until noon to find Reggie.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.982
After that,

16:50.017 --> 16:53.519
if Chief Johnson is wrong
about who killed these soldiers,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.321
I am sure she will help you
sound the alarm herself.

17:00.093 --> 17:03.362
Fine. We'll notify the families
as the FBI suggests.

17:03.397 --> 17:07.867
But if other soldiers die today
under similar circumstances,

17:07.901 --> 17:09.001
it's on you.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.309
Okay.
Uh, Lieutenant Flynn.

17:16.343 --> 17:17.977
I desperately need to speak
with Reggie Moses.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.278
Let's see
if we can bring him in.

17:19.313 --> 17:20.746
A-and get a warrant
for his house.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.013
Maybe we can find
some weapons

17:22.049 --> 17:23.549
that ties him
to last night's murders.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.849
Thank you.

17:24.885 --> 17:26.652
I, uh, figure you'll want
the files

17:26.686 --> 17:29.488
for the shootin' Newton murders
transferred to Major Crimes?

17:29.523 --> 17:30.756
Yes, commander.
Thank you.

17:30.791 --> 17:32.858
A-and get Chief Pope
down here, please?

17:32.893 --> 17:34.694
A-as soon as possible.

17:34.728 --> 17:35.761
I-I need his support

17:35.796 --> 17:38.130
for the L.A.P.D.'s position
on this case.

17:38.165 --> 17:42.401
Chief, the fact that
you made the short list

17:42.436 --> 17:44.136
for Chief of police
and Pope didn't --

17:44.171 --> 17:46.205
well, he's...

17:46.240 --> 17:48.174
He's a little bit
off balance.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.509
Then straighten him out,
please.

17:50.544 --> 17:51.944
I'm not about
to let the killer

17:51.979 --> 17:53.479
of three American soldiers
go free

17:53.513 --> 17:55.214
just because his nose
is out of joint.

18:05.168 --> 18:06.868
Charlie Niles.

18:06.903 --> 18:08.370
Owned his store
for 33 years.

18:08.404 --> 18:10.438
He'd give out candy
to any kid who came in

18:10.473 --> 18:12.107
and showed him
a good report card.

18:12.141 --> 18:15.177
Practically considered family
in the neighrhood.

18:15.211 --> 18:17.846
His grandson, Chris,
turned 8 a month ago.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.348
Shooter used a 9mm.

18:20.383 --> 18:22.317
No hits on the casings.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.785
Crime scene photos
are in here...

18:23.819 --> 18:25.220
If you want to see them.

18:25.254 --> 18:27.689
It didn't hit the press,
but, uh, apparently,

18:27.723 --> 18:31.726
little Chris here was, uh,
chased into a storage room,

18:31.761 --> 18:32.727
where he was...

18:32.762 --> 18:34.796
Shot in the head.

18:34.830 --> 18:37.232
What do they know
about Reggie Moses?

18:37.266 --> 18:39.601
Well, they say that
he's the number-three man

18:39.635 --> 18:41.236
in the 110 Crips.

18:41.270 --> 18:43.705
Certainly has the rap sheet
to prove it.

18:45.942 --> 18:47.909
Oh. Hello. Major.

18:47.944 --> 18:49.544
Notifications go okay?

18:49.579 --> 18:52.080
Well, the families have agreed
to keep the information

18:52.114 --> 18:54.916
to themselves for the moment,
if that's what you mean.

18:54.951 --> 18:57.385
I'm arranging for the FBI to relieve Gabriel
at the safe house,

18:57.420 --> 18:59.254
where we're protecting
T-ball's family.

18:59.288 --> 19:01.022
We'll maintain them there
till further notice.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.059
Thank you so much,
Agent Howard.

19:04.093 --> 19:05.493
Uh, commander.

19:05.528 --> 19:06.695
Any word on Chief Pope?

19:06.729 --> 19:08.163
He'll be here shortly.

19:08.197 --> 19:09.497
Oh.

19:09.532 --> 19:11.733
Chief, we found the bullets
on 59th Street

19:11.767 --> 19:13.435
right where Turell
said we would.

19:13.469 --> 19:15.937
And ballistics confirm
they came from the same AK-47

19:15.972 --> 19:18.340
used to kill our soldiers
last night.

19:18.374 --> 19:21.443
But the weapon from the
convenience store was a 9mm,

19:21.477 --> 19:22.611
so if what
Turell said is true,

19:22.645 --> 19:24.446
then Reggie switched guns.

19:24.480 --> 19:25.947
Newton found Reggie's prints

19:25.982 --> 19:27.415
all over the store counter.

19:27.450 --> 19:29.084
So it seems like
he's the right guy.

19:29.118 --> 19:31.419
Also,
according to the DMV,

19:31.454 --> 19:33.888
Reggie Moses owns
a black '97 Cutlass

19:33.923 --> 19:37.459
like the one T-ball says
was used by whoever shot at him.

19:37.493 --> 19:39.594
And that also matches
the description

19:39.629 --> 19:43.064
of the car used in the drive-by
last night.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.133
What?

19:45.167 --> 19:47.168
Reggie Moses
is a powerful member

19:47.203 --> 19:48.970
of the 110 Crips.

19:49.005 --> 19:50.438
I see him doing a drive-by,

19:50.473 --> 19:51.539
but why would he rob a store

19:51.574 --> 19:53.174
that's being protected
by his own gang?

19:53.209 --> 19:55.043
And shoot an 8-year-old boy
in the process?

19:55.077 --> 19:56.478
Well,
if it doesn't feel right,

19:56.512 --> 19:59.047
it's because there's something
Turell isn't telling you.

19:59.081 --> 20:00.115
I've said it before.

20:00.149 --> 20:01.583
Give him immunity.
Major --

20:01.617 --> 20:03.618
and get his story.
That is not an option. Major.

20:03.653 --> 20:05.754
It's pretty clear that he had nothing
to do with last night's drive-by.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.656
Uh, excuse me, Major.

20:07.690 --> 20:08.657
Chief?

20:08.691 --> 20:10.792
Meet Reggie Moses.

20:10.826 --> 20:13.161
You want him in there?

20:13.195 --> 20:14.596
Yes, please.

20:16.365 --> 20:18.600
Okay, well...

20:18.634 --> 20:21.770
Reggie's house came up clean --
no guns, no ammunition.

20:21.804 --> 20:22.837
But we have his cell,

20:22.872 --> 20:25.006
and that's another matter.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.242
He got a text last night.
Check this out.

20:27.276 --> 20:30.011
"Yo, Club Beatz
Turells in the house."

20:30.046 --> 20:32.280
Who sent that text?

20:32.315 --> 20:33.915
It's from a prepaid phone,
so there's no way of knowing.

20:33.949 --> 20:35.450
Reggie's crew is smart.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.185
Fyi, Newton division said

20:37.219 --> 20:39.020
that Reggie lawyered up
at the drop of a hat.

20:39.055 --> 20:40.655
Really?

20:43.125 --> 20:44.392
We'll see about that.

20:46.896 --> 20:49.998
Pardon me, gentlemen.

20:50.032 --> 20:52.701
You ever deal
with her before?

20:52.735 --> 20:54.602
Uh, on and off.

20:55.738 --> 20:56.738
Piece of work.

20:56.772 --> 20:58.573
My opinion,
she needs to get laid.

20:59.875 --> 21:01.509
Hmm.

21:01.544 --> 21:03.745
I don't think
that's the problem, really.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.451
Reggie,
I take it you're familiar

21:09.485 --> 21:11.186
with the Niles
Convenience Store?

21:13.656 --> 21:15.523
The police
found your prints there.

21:15.558 --> 21:17.125
So?

21:17.159 --> 21:18.893
So, they found them
while looking into the murder

21:18.928 --> 21:20.161
of the store's owner

21:20.196 --> 21:21.629
and his 8-year-old
grandson.

21:21.664 --> 21:23.164
Maybe I been
there before.

21:23.199 --> 21:24.999
But that doesn't mean
I killed nobody.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.068
Besides...

21:27.103 --> 21:29.204
I went through this already
with them other cops in Newton.

21:29.238 --> 21:30.538
Yeah,
but now we're pretty sure

21:30.573 --> 21:33.174
there's someone who can identify
you for those murders.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.442
Fool, please.

21:34.477 --> 21:36.444
I bet you all the cash
in your pocket

21:36.479 --> 21:38.279
there ain't
no such witness.

21:38.314 --> 21:39.848
Really?

21:39.882 --> 21:41.049
Did something happen
to that witness?

21:42.184 --> 21:43.251
What do you know?

21:43.285 --> 21:44.619
<i>Listen, Lady.</i>

21:44.653 --> 21:46.654
<i>I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>like I told them other cops</i>

21:46.689 --> 21:48.056
<i>who was coming at me.</i>

21:48.090 --> 21:49.357
<i>I want a lawyer.</i>

21:49.392 --> 21:50.859
Damn it.

21:50.893 --> 21:52.360
Major, I'm assistant Chief
Will Pope.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.662
Uh, Commander Taylor
brought me up to speed.

21:54.697 --> 21:56.064
How can I help you?

21:56.098 --> 21:57.832
<i>Lieutenant Flynn,</i>
<i>why don't you put Reggie here</i>

21:57.867 --> 22:00.602
in my conference room
while he waits for his attorney?

22:00.636 --> 22:02.904
And, uh, turn on the news
for him.

22:02.938 --> 22:05.607
Let's keep him abreast
of current events.

22:05.641 --> 22:07.842
Thank you.

22:16.619 --> 22:18.853
Come in.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.123
What's going on?

22:22.158 --> 22:24.659
We need Turell
to tell us what he knows.

22:24.693 --> 22:26.895
And offering him
an immunity agreement

22:26.929 --> 22:29.164
is the wrong play to make
at this time.

22:29.198 --> 22:31.366
I have just set up Reggie
to confess.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.301
How?
He asked for his lawyer.

22:33.335 --> 22:35.403
If you allow me to keep him
watching the news, he'll revoke.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.105
I-I just need
four more hours.

22:37.139 --> 22:38.973
You're actually asking
for <i>more</i> time?

22:39.008 --> 22:40.041
I don't believe this.

22:40.075 --> 22:41.242
Major.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.911
Turell's involvement
in this case

22:42.945 --> 22:45.313
is way too murky right now
to offer him a pass.

22:45.347 --> 22:46.781
If he tells me that
he was Reggie's accomplice,

22:46.816 --> 22:49.317
then he is as responsible
for the death of that little boy

22:49.351 --> 22:51.352
as if he pulled
the trigger himself.

22:51.387 --> 22:53.054
We cannot offer him
immunity.

22:53.088 --> 22:54.122
Yeah. Actually...

22:55.424 --> 22:56.991
You're considering this?

22:57.026 --> 22:58.159
I don't care if Turell,

22:58.194 --> 22:59.627
or T-ball,
or whatever his name is

22:59.662 --> 23:01.930
was a witness to what happened
in this convenience store

23:01.964 --> 23:03.298
or an accomplice.

23:03.332 --> 23:05.166
All I care about
is Reggie Moses

23:05.201 --> 23:07.502
I'm well aware of your objectives.
Arrested for the murders of my soldiers!

23:07.536 --> 23:09.804
And if the immunity agreement
can do that, that's it.

23:09.839 --> 23:11.172
I will get Reggie
to confess.

23:11.207 --> 23:12.907
Just give me four --
make it three more hours.

23:12.942 --> 23:14.175
Just three more hours.

23:14.210 --> 23:16.010
You're out of time!

23:16.045 --> 23:19.214
So make the immunity deal,
or I make my call.

23:19.248 --> 23:20.615
Let me know
what you're gonna do.

23:25.621 --> 23:26.654
Brenda, look,

23:26.689 --> 23:27.989
whatever else
happens here,

23:28.023 --> 23:30.492
the guy who shot and killed
three soldiers

23:30.526 --> 23:32.460
cannot leave
our custody again.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.828
This is not what I asked you
down here to do.

23:33.863 --> 23:35.330
Yes. It <i>is.</i>

23:35.364 --> 23:37.732
Have the D.A. draw up
an immunity agreement,

23:37.766 --> 23:40.335
get Turell to sign it
and tell you what he knows.

23:40.369 --> 23:41.836
If you want to have
any chance

23:41.871 --> 23:43.505
of being the next
Chief of Police,

23:43.539 --> 23:45.240
you cannot start a war
with the Army, here.

23:45.274 --> 23:46.741
Get this over with.

23:46.775 --> 23:49.043
For your own sake.

23:58.487 --> 24:01.256
Turell Baylor's
"get out of jail free" card.

24:01.290 --> 24:05.193
If it comes to that.

24:05.227 --> 24:06.961
You got Turell to give up
his right to counsel?

24:06.996 --> 24:08.596
I thought it might
expedite things.

24:08.631 --> 24:10.164
Look, without a witness
of some kind,

24:10.199 --> 24:12.700
you don't have a case
against Reggie Moses.

24:12.735 --> 24:14.435
Yeah, well,
what if Turell tells us

24:14.470 --> 24:16.638
that he and Reggie
robbed that store together?

24:16.672 --> 24:18.139
And they're both
responsible?

24:18.173 --> 24:20.675
Then Turell walks free.

24:21.744 --> 24:23.811
I agree.
It sucks.

24:23.846 --> 24:25.680
But let's do it anyway,
okay?

24:28.250 --> 24:30.985
I take it you read
the immunity agreement, Turell.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.186
You bet.

24:32.221 --> 24:33.655
You understand it's good

24:33.689 --> 24:35.557
only as long
as what you tell me is true?

24:35.591 --> 24:37.892
Yeah.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.395
And you can't use
<i>nothing</i> I say against me.

24:40.429 --> 24:41.563
Right?

24:41.597 --> 24:44.032
That's right.

24:44.066 --> 24:46.467
So, you initial
here, here,

24:46.502 --> 24:47.902
and you sign
down at the bottom.

24:47.937 --> 24:50.138
And we agree to provide you
and your family protection,

24:50.172 --> 24:52.473
so long as you are deemed
a cooperative witness

24:52.508 --> 24:53.841
when charges are filed

24:53.876 --> 24:55.076
against Reginald Moses.

24:55.110 --> 24:56.377
Sweet deal.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.551
You stated earlier
that Reggie Moses

25:03.586 --> 25:06.120
made two attempts on your life
in order to silence you.

25:06.155 --> 25:07.388
'Cause I know he the dude

25:07.423 --> 25:09.223
who killed those two
at the store.

25:09.258 --> 25:10.992
Here we go.

25:11.026 --> 25:12.327
<i>Tell me how you know that,</i>
<i>Turell.</i>

25:14.863 --> 25:16.664
<i>I was just going there</i>
<i>for a soda.</i>

25:16.699 --> 25:18.833
Reggie comes busting out
the door, crazy-eyed.

25:18.867 --> 25:20.468
I see he's got the 9
in his hand,

25:20.502 --> 25:21.536
I'm like, "what's up?"

25:21.570 --> 25:23.237
Thinking that he robbed
the place.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.840
He just took off.

25:25.874 --> 25:28.109
Then I go inside and see
old dude behind the counter

25:28.143 --> 25:29.544
with a hole in his chest.

25:29.578 --> 25:30.545
I freak.

25:30.579 --> 25:32.146
I'm looking around,

25:32.181 --> 25:34.549
find the little kid
in the back room...

25:36.685 --> 25:37.986
Reggie, man.

25:39.054 --> 25:41.255
Well...

25:41.290 --> 25:42.457
He shot him in the head.

25:43.592 --> 25:46.394
So I gave the cops
Reggie's name.

25:46.428 --> 25:48.429
But those fools just brought him
in for a few questions.

25:48.464 --> 25:49.864
Then they put him back
on the street,

25:49.898 --> 25:51.933
where he knows I'm the one
who dropped the dime on his ass.

25:51.967 --> 25:53.534
What do you think
he's gonna do then, huh?

25:56.238 --> 25:58.039
Is that all, Turell?

25:58.073 --> 25:59.774
What you mean, Lady,
"is that all"?

25:59.808 --> 26:00.775
That's what happened.

26:00.809 --> 26:01.876
Earlier this morning,

26:01.910 --> 26:03.077
you said you didn't want
to get in trouble.

26:03.112 --> 26:04.879
But according
to that statement,

26:04.913 --> 26:06.681
you haven't done
anything wrong.

26:06.715 --> 26:09.183
So why do you --
why do you need immunity?

26:11.820 --> 26:14.455
You mentioned that boy
in the store.

26:14.490 --> 26:17.058
Had you ever seen him
there before?

26:17.092 --> 26:18.426
No. Unh-unh.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.061
Then how'd you know
to go look for him, Turell?

26:21.597 --> 26:23.297
That boy was found
in the store, Turell,

26:23.332 --> 26:26.100
in an area...

26:26.135 --> 26:28.369
You couldn't see
from anywhere else in the store.

26:28.404 --> 26:32.774
You just said you found the
owner dead behind that counter.

26:32.808 --> 26:35.677
But instead of "boning"
out of there,

26:35.711 --> 26:38.579
you decided to, what,
wander around?

26:40.249 --> 26:42.050
There was blood,
you know?

26:42.084 --> 26:43.885
Like a til
on the floor.

26:43.919 --> 26:45.186
I just followed it
until I found the kid.

26:45.220 --> 26:46.654
Turell, look.

26:47.956 --> 26:49.023
There was no blood trail.

26:49.058 --> 26:51.092
That boy was chased
into the storage room

26:51.126 --> 26:52.093
before he was shot!

26:52.127 --> 26:54.429
Look.

26:54.463 --> 26:56.864
I don't know what to tell you,
all right?

26:56.899 --> 26:58.466
That's how it went.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.034
Listen to me, Turell.
Listen.

27:00.069 --> 27:02.437
I told you that immunity
agreement goes away if you lie,

27:02.471 --> 27:04.739
and that is exactly what you've done!

27:04.773 --> 27:06.074
There was no blood
on that floor!

27:06.108 --> 27:07.308
Reggie's defense lawyer

27:07.342 --> 27:09.944
will have that statement
of yours thrown out of court,

27:09.978 --> 27:11.412
and Reggie will walk.

27:11.447 --> 27:12.814
And not only will he walk

27:12.848 --> 27:14.816
for the convenience store
murders, but he will walk

27:14.850 --> 27:16.751
for killing your brother,
as well.

27:16.785 --> 27:18.319
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance,

27:18.353 --> 27:20.621
T-ball.

27:20.656 --> 27:22.824
And if you don't tell me
the truth this time --

27:22.858 --> 27:24.192
and I mean right now --

27:24.226 --> 27:25.760
I'm gonna send you home,

27:25.794 --> 27:26.928
release your family,

27:26.962 --> 27:29.263
and let Reggie back out
on the street.

27:29.298 --> 27:31.532
How do you think
that will turn out?

27:36.705 --> 27:37.839
I can say anything I want

27:37.873 --> 27:39.507
about what happened
in that store?

27:39.541 --> 27:42.143
As long as it's the truth,
yes, you can.

27:44.613 --> 27:47.148
And it can't be used against me
in court?

27:50.152 --> 27:51.552
Okay.

28:00.863 --> 28:03.664
Fine, then.
<i>I</i> did it.

28:06.135 --> 28:07.835
You did what?

28:07.870 --> 28:09.470
Oh, my God.

28:11.006 --> 28:12.673
Reggie didn't shoot nobody
in that store.

28:14.309 --> 28:16.844
I did.
I killed those people.

28:29.365 --> 28:31.500
Turell Baylor's
a double murderer?

28:31.519 --> 28:32.786
No one saw this coming.

28:34.889 --> 28:37.457
<i>I go to the store</i>
<i>now and then.</i>

28:37.491 --> 28:38.758
<i>Take some beers,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

28:38.793 --> 28:40.827
Thinking the old man
owed up

28:40.861 --> 28:42.262
for how good my boys
be treating him.

28:42.296 --> 28:43.830
Dude never made no fuss.

28:43.864 --> 28:46.766
Except this one day,

28:46.801 --> 28:49.169
he steps to <i>me.</i>

28:49.203 --> 28:51.905
Telling me
I'm taking advantage.

28:53.541 --> 28:54.874
I kept saying,

28:54.909 --> 28:58.411
"just give me
the damn beer."

28:58.446 --> 29:00.513
But he won't back off.

29:00.548 --> 29:02.782
He's yelling at me,

29:02.817 --> 29:05.151
getting in my face...

29:05.186 --> 29:07.220
Talking about how he gonna
rat me to my boys.

29:07.254 --> 29:08.955
Well, I ain't standing
for that.

29:08.989 --> 29:11.124
Nah.
Some broke-down fool

29:11.158 --> 29:13.326
is gonna make <i>me</i>
<i>look bad?</i>

29:13.360 --> 29:14.360
Unh-unh.

29:14.395 --> 29:15.528
So I pulled out my 9,

29:15.563 --> 29:16.696
and I shot him.

29:22.603 --> 29:24.337
Happy, Major?

29:24.371 --> 29:26.639
That clear everything up
for you?

29:28.676 --> 29:29.976
And the boy?

29:30.010 --> 29:31.644
I didn't know
he was there.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.281
Then I see him
crying in the doorway.

29:35.316 --> 29:36.449
He's looking at me.

29:36.484 --> 29:39.052
Like he's gonna remember
who I am, you know?

29:41.989 --> 29:44.824
When he started running...

29:44.859 --> 29:46.826
I just...

29:46.861 --> 29:48.895
Went after him.

29:55.269 --> 29:57.570
And after you shot
the kid?

29:59.840 --> 30:01.508
Ran into Reggie
on my way out.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.176
I knew I was in trouble
with him

30:03.210 --> 30:05.612
'cause I shouldn't have been
messing around there.

30:05.646 --> 30:09.516
So you called the police
and blamed it on him.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.918
That's right.
To save <i>my</i> ass.

30:13.154 --> 30:14.888
Ain't like
I had a choice.

30:20.961 --> 30:22.695
We have two
separate perpetrators.

30:22.730 --> 30:25.131
Reggie's triple murder
outside the club last night

30:25.166 --> 30:27.567
and Turell's double murder
at the convenience store

30:27.601 --> 30:28.635
two weeks ago.

30:28.669 --> 30:29.903
And due to recent events,

30:29.937 --> 30:32.472
that double murder case
is now <i>dead.</i>

30:32.506 --> 30:35.141
But Turell said that Reggie
saw him walk out of the store.

30:35.176 --> 30:37.477
That makes Reggie your witness
against Turell.

30:37.511 --> 30:38.978
But Reggie would also
want a deal

30:39.013 --> 30:40.780
to testify
against Turell.

30:40.814 --> 30:42.882
And no prosecutor,
including me,

30:42.917 --> 30:44.851
would ever offer him anything
less than the death penalty

30:44.885 --> 30:46.085
for shooting
three soldiers.

30:46.120 --> 30:48.655
So, unless we find new evidence
or a new witness,

30:48.689 --> 30:49.689
Turell walks.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.424
At least you got
your confirmation.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.825
Right, Major?

30:54.495 --> 30:56.596
So this is not the outcome
you wanted,

30:56.630 --> 30:58.464
but now we know for sure why Reggie pulled
the trigger last night.

30:58.499 --> 31:00.667
You can make your arrest,
and then we can proceed --
no, we can't.

31:00.701 --> 31:01.935
We have no
physical evidence

31:01.969 --> 31:03.937
tying Reggie
to last night's murders.

31:03.971 --> 31:06.272
His motive is legally
established. We could --

31:06.307 --> 31:07.507
motive isn't evidence,
Major.

31:07.541 --> 31:10.577
You're saying
this bastard walks, too?

31:10.611 --> 31:11.744
That's what we're saying.

31:11.779 --> 31:13.646
Unless he confesses.

31:13.681 --> 31:15.381
And considering we can't even talk to him
since he lawyered up...

31:15.416 --> 31:17.183
I will get him to revoke,

31:17.218 --> 31:19.452
if I can just go back to
the plan I was carrying out

31:19.486 --> 31:22.255
before this immunity deal
was forced on me.

31:22.289 --> 31:24.991
You see a way to arrest Reggie
for killing those servicemen?

31:25.025 --> 31:27.227
Yes, Major, I do, because
Reggie was never aiming

31:27.261 --> 31:28.695
at those servicemen.

31:42.309 --> 31:43.610
<i>Write down everything</i>

31:43.644 --> 31:45.245
<i>that happened</i>
<i>at the convenience store.</i>

32:00.127 --> 32:03.129
<i>Is Southern California's</i>
<i>housing market</i>

32:03.163 --> 32:04.897
<i>finally on the rebound?</i>

32:04.932 --> 32:07.267
<i>Prices for the first month...</i>

32:07.301 --> 32:09.969
Yo, don't I get a phone call
or something?

32:10.004 --> 32:11.371
Keep me sitting here
all this time.

32:11.405 --> 32:13.006
And where's my damn lawyer?

32:13.040 --> 32:15.275
I promise you you'll get
your phone call, Reggie,

32:15.309 --> 32:16.576
and when
your lawyer arrives,

32:16.610 --> 32:17.877
we'll be sure
to let him know

32:17.911 --> 32:19.379
that we've arrested you
for murder.

32:19.413 --> 32:20.647
Arrested me
for <i>what</i> murder?

32:20.681 --> 32:22.715
Witness came forward
willing to testify

32:22.750 --> 32:24.517
that he saw you running
from Niles convenience store.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.985
Man, I told you before.

32:26.020 --> 32:27.654
Even bet you the cash
in your pocket.

32:27.688 --> 32:29.122
There ain't
no such witness.

32:29.156 --> 32:31.257
I can understand why you would
think that's the case,

32:31.292 --> 32:32.792
especially after the stunt
you pulled.

32:32.826 --> 32:34.127
What stunt?

32:34.161 --> 32:36.195
Those guys you shot at
outside the club last night.

32:38.532 --> 32:40.133
Guess what, Reggie.
You missed.

32:41.201 --> 32:43.970
I believe you know
Turell Baylor here.

32:46.073 --> 32:47.373
Son of a bitch.

32:47.408 --> 32:49.042
He certainly knows <i>you.</i>

32:49.076 --> 32:51.311
There's the reaction
we want.

32:51.345 --> 32:53.713
Considering you tried
to kill him twice.

32:53.747 --> 32:55.315
That's why he's agreed to make
an official statement

32:55.349 --> 32:56.649
against you.

32:56.684 --> 32:57.817
And the two guys
who were with Turell

32:57.851 --> 32:59.252
when you took a shot
at him --

32:59.286 --> 33:01.854
they're giving
their statements upstairs.

33:01.889 --> 33:04.223
Turns out you're a hell
of a bad shot, Reg.

33:04.258 --> 33:05.692
You were watching the news.

33:05.726 --> 33:08.027
Did you see any stories about
people getting gunned down

33:08.062 --> 33:09.595
in front of a nightclub
last night?

33:09.630 --> 33:11.898
37 shots,
and you didn't hit any of them.

33:11.932 --> 33:13.499
Which is lucky,
actually,

33:13.534 --> 33:15.068
or you'd be on your way to
an indictment for five murders

33:15.102 --> 33:16.402
instead of just two.

33:16.437 --> 33:20.173
Either way, what T-ball
is writing down in there

33:20.207 --> 33:21.574
is gonna put you away
for the rest of your life.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.409
But the thing is, Reggie,

33:23.444 --> 33:25.912
I think he's lying.

33:25.946 --> 33:27.413
I think he's setting you up
to take the fall

33:27.448 --> 33:29.048
for what <i>he</i> did.

33:29.083 --> 33:30.416
But I can't prove it

33:30.451 --> 33:32.085
because you won't talk
to me.

33:32.119 --> 33:34.053
I didn't kill nobody!
Shh!

33:34.088 --> 33:36.823
Revoke your right to counsel if you want
to give me your side.

33:40.461 --> 33:42.395
Yeah, okay.

33:42.429 --> 33:44.263
I'll talk.

33:44.298 --> 33:46.366
I'll tell you
what happened.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.601
It was that fool right there that was
running out of the store

33:48.635 --> 33:50.436
when I rolled up!

33:50.471 --> 33:52.004
Newton Division's
got <i>your</i> prints.

33:52.039 --> 33:53.740
Because I leaned over the
counter to see the old man.

33:53.774 --> 33:56.142
Then I booked.
And what about the boy?

33:56.176 --> 33:58.211
I didn't even know he was there
till I sawt on the news.

33:59.513 --> 34:01.881
I ain't got it in me
to kill no little kid.

34:03.450 --> 34:04.484
And besides,

34:04.518 --> 34:06.986
that store is protected.

34:07.020 --> 34:08.321
Things like that
come back on you,

34:08.355 --> 34:09.355
on the streets...

34:10.791 --> 34:12.425
...Or in prison.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.559
Is that why you wanted
to shut Turell up?

34:15.496 --> 34:16.696
Yeah.

34:18.998 --> 34:21.434
Firing a gun inside city limits
is illegal.

34:21.467 --> 34:24.003
And you did damage
to several cars.

34:24.036 --> 34:25.438
But since you just
gave me testimony

34:25.472 --> 34:26.773
against Turell here,

34:26.806 --> 34:29.108
I'm not gonna charge you
for any of that,

34:29.143 --> 34:31.244
as long as you tell me where you dumped
the gun you used last night.

34:31.277 --> 34:33.679
As long as people know
it wasn't me who did that store.

34:35.549 --> 34:38.851
The gun's buried underneath
my neighbor's porch.

34:38.886 --> 34:40.820
The yellow one...
Next door.

34:41.621 --> 34:43.790
Got him.

34:43.824 --> 34:46.259
<i>Well, I'm sure you did</i>
<i>what you thought was necessary.</i>

34:46.293 --> 34:47.893
It can't be easy --

34:47.928 --> 34:50.429
you being in the same gang
and all.

34:53.766 --> 34:56.101
And I bet you've known T-ball
a long time.

34:56.136 --> 34:59.439
Yeah, since he was
a little kid.

34:59.473 --> 35:00.740
You know his brother, too.

35:00.774 --> 35:01.874
Yeah, I know Ty.

35:01.909 --> 35:03.810
He joined up the Army,
I think.

35:03.844 --> 35:05.244
Fightin' in Afghanistan.

35:05.279 --> 35:07.079
I ain't seen him
in a while.

35:08.882 --> 35:11.083
Actually, Reggie,
you have.

35:12.152 --> 35:14.020
What do you mean?

35:14.054 --> 35:16.722
Ty got back
just yesterday.

35:18.091 --> 35:20.092
And you saw him, Reggie.

35:20.127 --> 35:21.461
Where?

35:21.495 --> 35:23.796
In the parking lot
of the club last night.

35:23.831 --> 35:25.898
You mistook Ty
for Turell.

35:25.933 --> 35:28.067
You shot him to death along
with two of his Army buddies.

35:28.101 --> 35:29.836
No, no, no, no.
You said I didn't kill nobody.

35:29.870 --> 35:31.170
I lied.

35:31.205 --> 35:32.104
Bitch, I'll...

35:37.277 --> 35:38.678
Where --
what -- what --
what just happened?

35:38.712 --> 35:39.946
I don't know.

35:39.980 --> 35:41.647
She must have killed
the feed.

35:43.584 --> 35:45.618
You shot and killed three
U.S. Army Rangers last night,

35:45.652 --> 35:47.153
trying to get back
at Turell.

35:47.187 --> 35:49.822
So <i>you</i> end up
with the death penalty,

35:49.857 --> 35:51.491
and T-ball here,
he gets to go home,

35:51.525 --> 35:52.859
right back out
on the street --

35:52.893 --> 35:55.294
even after what he did to
those people in that store.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.001
All right,
Lieutenant Flynn.

36:02.035 --> 36:05.238
It's time to give Reggie
his phone call now.

36:05.272 --> 36:06.939
In fact, make it two.

36:06.974 --> 36:09.775
However many you need.

36:09.810 --> 36:13.312
It's the L.A.P.D.'s
unlimited calling plan, Reggie.

36:13.347 --> 36:14.647
Make good use of it.

36:26.226 --> 36:27.493
Chief.

36:27.528 --> 36:29.394
What do you want to do
with Turell?

36:31.231 --> 36:32.865
I want to abide
by the immunity agreement

36:32.900 --> 36:34.700
we made with him,
Detective.

36:34.735 --> 36:35.768
Don't you?

36:59.845 --> 37:00.911
Hey.

37:00.946 --> 37:02.012
Hey.

37:03.148 --> 37:04.915
Listen.

37:04.950 --> 37:06.117
About Turell.

37:06.151 --> 37:07.685
We'll stay on him.

37:07.719 --> 37:09.387
You know,
one way or another...

37:09.421 --> 37:10.688
Don't worry about Turell.

37:10.722 --> 37:13.290
You have a plan
to deal with him?

37:13.325 --> 37:15.459
I do.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.228
Good.

37:17.262 --> 37:19.463
It may seem to you

37:19.498 --> 37:22.400
like my decision
to give this creep immunity

37:22.434 --> 37:25.035
was somehow related to
this whole "Chief" business...

37:25.070 --> 37:26.437
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not at all.

37:26.471 --> 37:28.672
Brenda, let me just get this...
Out of the way.

37:28.707 --> 37:32.943
I would hate for what's gone on
between us the past few weeks,

37:32.978 --> 37:35.112
you know, my behavior...

37:35.147 --> 37:36.447
To completely cancel out

37:36.481 --> 37:38.916
everything we've been
through together.

37:45.257 --> 37:46.857
Let me just say...

37:46.892 --> 37:49.427
I'm sorry.

37:51.663 --> 37:53.431
And, uh,
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:53.465 --> 37:54.465
Yes, you will.

38:25.764 --> 38:28.966
I want to thank you
for coming forward, Turell.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.000
Because of you,

38:30.035 --> 38:31.202
the man who murdered
your brother

38:31.236 --> 38:32.736
will be facing
the death penalty.

38:32.771 --> 38:33.971
That's good.

38:34.005 --> 38:35.840
Yeah. It's the least
I could do, right?

38:35.874 --> 38:37.041
Well, not really.

38:37.075 --> 38:39.510
There's still
the business

38:39.544 --> 38:42.279
about the old man and
the little boy you murdered.

38:44.216 --> 38:45.816
You said we were done
with that.

38:45.851 --> 38:46.951
You still have immunity,

38:46.985 --> 38:48.385
and that's a fact.

38:48.420 --> 38:51.489
But if you would consider
revoking that agreement,

38:51.523 --> 38:53.090
I might be able
to help you.

38:53.124 --> 38:55.159
Nah, I ain't <i>never</i>
<i>giving up my immunity, Lady.</i>

38:55.193 --> 38:57.528
You gavet to me,
I'm keeping it.

38:57.562 --> 38:58.529
I figured as much.

38:58.563 --> 38:59.997
So you know, Turell,

39:00.031 --> 39:01.499
your family's gonna remain
under FBI protection

39:01.533 --> 39:04.602
until tomorrow
when I bring them home.

39:04.636 --> 39:05.903
You mean they're not
at my house?

39:08.106 --> 39:09.206
Who's gonna stay here
with me, then?

39:09.241 --> 39:11.242
No one, I guess.

39:32.797 --> 39:34.131
What's up, T-ball?

39:34.165 --> 39:36.834
Hey.

39:59.257 --> 40:00.558
See you, Turell.

40:00.592 --> 40:02.426
Wait.
Where you going?

40:02.460 --> 40:03.627
Home. Why?

40:03.662 --> 40:05.062
What's up
with my protection?

40:05.096 --> 40:06.730
You're supposed to be
protecting me.

40:06.765 --> 40:07.932
According to the agreement
you signed,

40:07.966 --> 40:09.166
we are only obligated
to protect you

40:09.200 --> 40:10.968
as long as you remain a credible
witness against Reggie

40:11.002 --> 40:12.469
in the convenience store
murders.

40:12.504 --> 40:14.872
And that's no longer
the case, is it?

40:16.441 --> 40:18.709
Come on.
You can't just leave me here.

40:18.743 --> 40:20.911
Yes, I can.

40:24.282 --> 40:25.182
Please.

40:25.216 --> 40:28.786
Don't worry, Turell.

40:29.921 --> 40:33.290
I have a feeling I'll be looking
into your eyes again very...

40:33.325 --> 40:34.792
Very soon.

41:02.287 --> 41:04.855
Chief, you sure
we shouldn't stick around?

41:04.889 --> 41:06.357
I'm positive.
Let's go.

41:06.391 --> 41:08.425
How'd his boys even know
he was home?

41:08.460 --> 41:10.494
The story hasn't even
hit the news yet.

41:10.528 --> 41:13.097
Reggie Moses was
entitled to a phone call.

41:13.131 --> 41:14.665
Maybe <i>he</i> spread the word.

41:21.239 --> 41:22.873
David, I want to leave.

41:26.277 --> 41:27.211
Please.
