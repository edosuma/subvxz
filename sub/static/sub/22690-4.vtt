02:40.452 --> 02:41.512
Turn on the lights!

02:41.536 --> 02:43.913
- Turn it on!
- Okay. Okay! Hold on! Hold on!

02:46.791 --> 02:48.191
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.753
- Turn around, I pull the trigger. Got it?
- Uh-huh.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.923
You got a part of a weapons shipment
from the Greeks. Where is it?

02:54.006 --> 02:55.132
Greeks dicked me.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.343
Should've guessed, right,
with a name like Turk?

02:57.427 --> 02:59.470
- Maybe they didn't know I was black.
- Hilarious.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.514
They found someone
who could take the entire load.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.878
That was too much weight for me.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.726
That high-tech shit ain't easy to sell.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.185
- Who is it?
- I don't know...

03:06.269 --> 03:07.955
Keep your goddamn eyes forward.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.565
I mean, I got some stuff. It ain't much...

03:10.648 --> 03:12.650
- Show me.
- It's over there.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.528
- Move.
- Okay. Okay.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.408
- Open it.
- I gotta open it, too?

03:21.158 --> 03:22.660
God damn it.

03:23.661 --> 03:24.787
The hell is that?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.832
It was a special order.

03:27.915 --> 03:29.675
Gangster's birthday present
for his daughter.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.503
He called it Sweet Sixteen.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.297
- You got ammo?
- Uh-uh.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.466
I don't hand it over loaded, my friend.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.135
- Real way to get jacked.
- Yeah, not good enough.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.929
Hey... I've done nothing to you.

03:42.013 --> 03:45.099
I'm just a guy trying to make a living.
Supply and demand.

03:45.182 --> 03:47.852
What people do with the guns isn't on me.

03:47.935 --> 03:49.061
Swear to God.

03:49.145 --> 03:51.439
You believe in God, Turk?

03:51.523 --> 03:53.858
Well, right now, I want to.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.325
Look, man...

04:04.076 --> 04:08.248
I ain't seen you,
don't know you, don't want to.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.167
So how about you let a brother go, huh?

04:13.461 --> 04:14.962
For Christ's sake.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.341
Let's go to bed.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.427
Get up.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.264
Oh, you're getting so big.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.686
Brush your teeth, okay?

04:29.769 --> 04:31.163
- Good night.
- Love you.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.355
Love you, too.

04:56.253 --> 04:58.130
How'd we do?

04:58.214 --> 04:59.841
- "How'd we do?"
- Yeah.

05:01.092 --> 05:05.972
An Ithaca, SAW, M4, M40,
ammo and grenades, right?

05:06.055 --> 05:07.432
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.266
He didn't have any of that shit.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.393
Nothing.

05:12.019 --> 05:13.313
Maggot Turk.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.939
- What?
- Yeah.

05:15.022 --> 05:17.734
He said that the whole shipment
went to someone else.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.652
Well, the NYPD doesn't know that.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.696
I accessed their e-mails
and informant reports.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.948
I mean, they were all over Turk.
You gotta believe me.

05:24.031 --> 05:26.075
Believe you?
You know what I believe in?

05:26.158 --> 05:28.911
Resupply and logistics,
that's what I believe in.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.288
NYP... I don't give a shit about the NYPD.

05:31.373 --> 05:35.167
You wanna go up against Agent Orange
with a pink Ruger and no ammo?

05:35.251 --> 05:37.086
Is that what you wanna do, Lieberman? Huh?

05:40.172 --> 05:42.467
- Is this it? No?
- No, of course not.

05:42.550 --> 05:44.260
No?

05:44.343 --> 05:46.137
You find my goddamn guns.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.412
We are about to be the proud owners

05:53.436 --> 05:56.188
of a million dollars' worth
of illegal weapons.

05:56.981 --> 06:00.067
Right now the guns are on a freighter
just off the three-mile line

06:00.151 --> 06:01.861
due into Jersey tomorrow.

06:01.944 --> 06:06.240
We could, uh, roll up the Greeks
and the guns the minute they hit the dock.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.121
Or, you know,
maybe we just tomahawk their asses.

06:12.204 --> 06:14.644
Send 'em to Davy Jones' Locker.
Kill 'em all. What do you say?

06:15.207 --> 06:16.793
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

06:19.128 --> 06:21.881
Can't trace the deposits
into Wolf's offshore account.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.758
The Greeks and the guns?

06:23.841 --> 06:25.217
Uh, what?

06:25.301 --> 06:27.011
The Greeks and the guns.

06:27.094 --> 06:30.222
Now, why don't we just take 'em
while they're still on the boat?

06:30.306 --> 06:33.560
No, I want to catch 'em on US soil,
in the act of selling them.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.645
We hit the boat, all we get is the crew,

06:35.728 --> 06:37.522
who likely don't know
what they're carrying.

06:37.605 --> 06:41.108
Wolf did a lot of work on this case.
Let's see it through.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.487
He was a good cop.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.657
For a dirty cop.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.870
I, uh, need your authorization...

06:54.246 --> 06:55.832
for the tactical operation.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.131
Rafi.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.174
Uh, Agent Stein, this is...

07:05.257 --> 07:08.470
Operations Director Hernandez.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.597
Likewise. Sam, right?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.640
Mind if I borrow her for a minute?

07:13.140 --> 07:14.976
Yes. Of course, uh...

07:16.102 --> 07:17.394
Excuse me.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.776
- It's good to see you.
- And you.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.697
You've lost weight.

07:27.780 --> 07:30.282
You haven't.

07:30.366 --> 07:34.621
So, Dinah Madani,
special agent in charge.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.247
Acting SAC. Hmm.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.875
Perform well,
and the position becomes permanent.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.961
And how much did you
have to do with this, Rafi?

07:42.044 --> 07:43.505
They ask, I recommend.

07:43.963 --> 07:46.090
Past that, I'm just one voice
in the wilderness.

07:46.173 --> 07:48.384
You're... you're so full of shit.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.931
The Office of the Inspector General
is taking over

07:54.015 --> 07:55.892
the investigation into Wolf's death.

08:00.855 --> 08:01.939
There are questions.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.069
He was dirty.

08:07.529 --> 08:10.447
- Thirty-million-in-the-bank dirty.
- Yes.

08:10.532 --> 08:11.866
And Wolf being corrupt

08:11.949 --> 08:14.410
puts this whole field office
under a cloud.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.453
It has to go up a level.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.666
First Kandahar, now Wolf.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.920
Seems like everyone's telling me
what not to investigate.

08:24.212 --> 08:25.671
Grow up, Dinah.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.257
I recruited you 15 years ago

08:28.340 --> 08:30.802
with the ambition to put you
right where you sit.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.511
We shared that, you and I.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.597
Earn your stripes here...

08:35.389 --> 08:37.558
and then you get to decide
how things are done,

08:37.642 --> 08:38.809
shape policy.

08:39.434 --> 08:42.313
But that involves playing
as part of a team.

08:43.355 --> 08:44.816
You were always passionate.

08:45.399 --> 08:46.901
It fueled you in a good way.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.695
But obsession...

08:48.778 --> 08:51.739
I'm not gonna give up trying to find
whoever killed Ahmad Zubair

08:51.822 --> 08:53.115
or why.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.076
He was our ally, Rafi.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.410
It was war.

08:56.493 --> 08:58.495
Sometimes the wrong people get killed.

08:59.246 --> 09:03.125
Don't lose sight of the greater good
we serve by focusing on one injustice.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.086
What about the people at risk

09:05.169 --> 09:08.089
from those guns you're about to snatch
from the Greeks?

09:10.550 --> 09:11.670
You wanna make a difference?

09:13.510 --> 09:17.181
Work this desk, work this office,
make your cases.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.642
And you came all the way from DC
to tell me that?

09:20.101 --> 09:24.396
I came to make sure you understand
the opportunity that lies before you.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.691
To make sure you take it.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.068
Unless this is...

09:31.696 --> 09:33.447
not right for you anymore?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.200
Don't play me, Rafi.

09:40.287 --> 09:43.415
I'm heading back to DC.
You don't need a babysitter, Dinah...

09:44.375 --> 09:46.127
just a priority check.

10:08.858 --> 10:10.151
Is that mine?

10:11.485 --> 10:14.405
Cleaned this thing in the past year?

10:16.323 --> 10:19.326
I mean, that's kinda low.
Taking your partner's gun.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.412
I'm sorry, are we partners?

10:23.080 --> 10:25.875
Lieberman, say your kid asks you
for a dog, right?

10:26.668 --> 10:29.420
He begs you for it,
so you finally get him one. But...

10:29.503 --> 10:30.783
he doesn't take care of the dog.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.024
He doesn't feed it.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.300
And he doesn't walk it.
Doesn't clean it.

10:34.383 --> 10:36.510
So the dog gets sick, brings home fleas.

10:36.593 --> 10:38.763
Dog pisses in the house.
What do you do?

10:38.846 --> 10:40.640
Well, I don't shoot the dog.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.434
You know, if that's what you're asking.
Or the kid.

10:43.517 --> 10:47.271
I mean, I am the kid in this,
uh, metaphor, right?

10:47.354 --> 10:49.816
You show the kid how to feed the dog...

10:49.940 --> 10:52.443
and walk the dog
and take care of the dog.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.153
But you only do it once.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.197
There's your weapon.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.951
For the record,
I know how to clean the dog.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.795
- That right?
- All right? Yeah, it's just...

11:02.829 --> 11:04.330
- Yeah?
- This is for show. Okay?

11:04.413 --> 11:07.083
- I never use this.
- It's for show, huh?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.978
You know, where I'm from, that weapon,

11:09.043 --> 11:10.878
that's the difference
between life or death.

11:10.962 --> 11:12.839
You pull it out,
you better be ready to use it.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.173
It's not for show.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.762
We should have just got
the guns on the street.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.973
Yeah, is that what we should have done,
Lieberman?

11:22.973 --> 11:24.617
You wanna put money
in those animals' hands?

11:24.641 --> 11:26.853
That's not happening, all right?
Not on my watch.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.355
I keep forgetting
about your thing, Frank.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.482
Only do unto bad guys.

11:31.565 --> 11:35.402
Rob Badass Peter
so you can kill Psycho Paul,

11:35.486 --> 11:37.238
so on and so forth.
What do you call that?

11:37.321 --> 11:39.866
Is that a code?
I mean, is it a mantra?

11:39.949 --> 11:42.827
It's not a mantra, right? Is it an ethos?

11:42.910 --> 11:46.080
What if we got you
a little pair of green tights

11:46.163 --> 11:49.083
and a pointy cap with a feather in it...

11:55.714 --> 11:57.008
Who's calling you?

11:58.592 --> 11:59.593
It's your wife.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.139
Um...

12:04.766 --> 12:06.183
Why does Sarah have your number?

12:06.767 --> 12:07.852
I got hers.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.561
Why?

12:12.189 --> 12:13.189
Leverage.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.443
Leverage on who?

12:17.945 --> 12:19.738
You.

12:24.035 --> 12:25.870
You gonna find out what she wants?

12:34.711 --> 12:36.672
- Knock yourself out.
- Yeah.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.264
Pete, hi.
It's, uh... It's Sarah Lieberman.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.850
I hit you with my car.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.812
Sorry again about that.
Um, but the reason I'm calling is

12:51.896 --> 12:54.565
I need you to sign a statement
for my insurance.

12:54.648 --> 12:56.775
They won't fix the car without it.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.986
So if you could give me a call
when you get a chance.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.404
Thank you so much.

13:10.497 --> 13:14.168
You know, uh,
if you wanna be an asshole, that's fine.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.253
If you don't wanna be partners,
that's fine. But...

13:16.337 --> 13:18.047
this woman has nothing to do with this.

13:20.007 --> 13:24.178
So... you want your resupply...

13:25.221 --> 13:26.555
help her out.

13:27.639 --> 13:30.852
I'll get your guns, but not before that.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.153
So what? You just...

13:42.529 --> 13:46.117
You're gonna hold the mission hostage
over... over a headlight?

13:49.661 --> 13:52.539
- Call it leverage.
- Yeah.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.226
It's 40 degrees out.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.022
Don't bother me.

14:16.688 --> 14:17.814
Want me to leave?

14:17.899 --> 14:19.901
No, I meant the cold. It don't bother me.

14:19.984 --> 14:23.320
As long as you ain't come here
to try and drag my ass back to group.

14:25.572 --> 14:26.698
Your dad...

14:27.366 --> 14:28.868
he told me what happened.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.329
Okay, yeah.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.875
An accident. I had a nightmare.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.878
It's no big thing.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.464
And now you're sleeping
in a hole in November.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.342
I don't have nightmares out here.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.263
I should never have discharged, Curtis.

14:50.806 --> 14:54.685
None of it, the heat, cold, sand, noise,

14:54.768 --> 14:57.354
fifty guys stinking up a dorm...

14:57.438 --> 14:59.690
it never kept me up.

14:59.773 --> 15:02.151
Never bothered me. I slept good.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.112
Want some advice?

15:05.862 --> 15:08.074
I thought that you didn't come here
for that.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.326
No, I'm talking about the hole.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.538
You see, what you got here
that you don't got in Iraq...

15:14.746 --> 15:15.957
is rain.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.000
And the way you got this bitch dug,

15:18.083 --> 15:20.753
you fall asleep down there,
your ass liable to drown.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.964
Your farts will be bubbling.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.633
What you want is, you wanna dig
a couple feet deeper on this end.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.969
That way, you got a sump for the water.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.848
You see, my pops, he served in Nam.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.767
In Nam, you're talking...

15:35.392 --> 15:36.727
you're talking jungle.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.563
The ground's soft, but the rain...

15:39.646 --> 15:41.315
...it's never-ending.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.401
My pops dug his share,
and he never shut up about it.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.871
He said, "Boy...

15:55.955 --> 15:59.291
war's the only chance you got
at doing something redeeming."

16:01.418 --> 16:03.295
And you got that over there?

16:04.463 --> 16:06.590
Your leg.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.844
"You got that over there."

16:11.887 --> 16:13.347
Are you listening to yourself?

16:13.430 --> 16:16.308
I didn't get nothing over there.
I lost it.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.937
No, seriously, on a...
Somewhere on a Baghdad rooftop

16:20.021 --> 16:21.938
is a size 11 shoe
with my foot still in it.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.482
Yeah, well, you know what I meant.

16:23.565 --> 16:27.444
I think I do know what you meant.
But I don't think you know what you meant.

16:27.528 --> 16:31.157
You see, when you look in a mirror,
you still see a soldier.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.575
And out on these streets,

16:33.659 --> 16:36.161
that soldier is invisible
to everyone else.

16:36.328 --> 16:37.913
If only you'd got something over there,

16:37.997 --> 16:41.750
like half your face burnt off
or a hook for a hand.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.419
That's what you meant.

16:45.379 --> 16:48.299
Come on... we miss you at the meetings.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.470
Talking, it doesn't work.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.308
You're all scared. I'm not scared.

17:00.019 --> 17:04.481
I'm gonna sign up with
a private military group called Anvil.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.858
Go back over there.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.486
You're ready for that kind of work?

17:09.569 --> 17:11.071
Why wouldn't I be?

17:11.155 --> 17:13.865
My evaluation reports
are always excellent.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.576
I don't doubt it.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.788
Look, how about you come on out of there
and we go and talk more about it?

17:19.871 --> 17:21.248
No, I'm good.

17:25.294 --> 17:26.295
Okay.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.465
Well, you know how to find me.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.439
Shit.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.697
Zach, TV off.
Don't you have homework to do?

17:57.409 --> 17:59.536
- Hey.
- Hey. Wow.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.456
- You look different.
- Oh, yeah...

18:02.539 --> 18:03.874
Yeah.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.042
People kept telling me
I look like a hipster.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.587
And I really, uh...
I really don't like hipsters, so...

18:08.670 --> 18:10.214
Right.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.674
Um, well, anyway,
thank you so much for doing this.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.878
- Of course.
- Appreciate it.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.678
- Sure. Okay.
- Let me go get you the paperwork.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.640
How's it going, buddy?

18:20.974 --> 18:22.935
It's just a...
It's just a release form

18:23.018 --> 18:24.978
saying that, uh, you're not gonna sue me

18:25.061 --> 18:27.606
if you wind up with chronic back pain,
or whatever.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.609
But they... they won't process it
until you sign. So...

18:31.318 --> 18:32.319
Thank you.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.503
- Right here?
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

18:35.614 --> 18:39.075
Zach, screen time is over.
Come on, go do your homework.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.161
Don't have any.

18:40.244 --> 18:42.371
You want me to go
through your notebook?

18:42.454 --> 18:44.873
- Not really.
- Then go upstairs.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.254
God...

18:51.087 --> 18:53.632
If I have to ask you one more time,
there will be consequences.

18:53.715 --> 18:54.716
Go.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.808
Tough guy, huh?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.100
Yeah.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.812
He's just having a hard time.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.981
Unfortunately, he handles it
by being an asshole.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.983
Yeah, sounds like somebody I know.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.403
- Uh, this should be a...
- Yeah, me, too.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.298
- Perfect. Thank you.
- This is everything, right? Yeah.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.699
- I appreciate the...
- Ow!

19:18.782 --> 19:20.382
- God damn it! Mother...
- Leo...

19:20.409 --> 19:23.287
- Hey, you okay? You okay?
- Wrench slipped. Yeah.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.121
- Oh.
- What's going on?

19:25.206 --> 19:27.791
- The garbage disposal's acting up.
- Oh, boy.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.419
Maybe I can give you a hand.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.422
- Yeah... sure.
- All right. Mind if I...

19:32.463 --> 19:34.506
No, would you, please?

19:34.590 --> 19:35.966
Have at it.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.884
Okay, let's see. Oh, boy.

19:37.968 --> 19:39.470
Let's see what's going on.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.307
Yeah, that looks like a two-man job.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.769
All right, let's take a look.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.316
Well, that's really in there, huh?
What is that?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.193
All right, if I open this...

19:57.070 --> 19:59.072
Think you can pull that sucker
out of there?

19:59.155 --> 20:00.449
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

20:00.532 --> 20:01.867
Give it a wallop.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.621
Oh! Attagirl. Good job.

20:05.704 --> 20:07.504
- Oh!
- Three guesses who put this down there.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.375
God.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.042
She's pretty handy.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.670
I think you got a future engineer
on your hands.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.797
Yeah, well, I don't know
who she gets it from.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.841
I'm useless.

20:17.924 --> 20:21.136
And David was brilliant, but I mean,
never really got his hands dirty.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.304
Is that right?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.548
Yeah, when... when things would break,
we'd call a guy.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.558
- Hmm. Now...
- Right?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.353
...you don't need to call a guy anymore.

20:31.438 --> 20:32.689
You got Leo.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.983
- Good job.
- All right,

20:35.066 --> 20:36.735
your hands are filthy. Go wash 'em.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.363
- Nice work, Pete.
- Yeah, you too, sweetheart.

20:39.446 --> 20:40.447
Use soap.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.410
- That's a good kid.
- Yeah.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.537
Yeah, she is. Hmm.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.041
I mean,
she takes too much on.

20:51.417 --> 20:55.337
Here. I tell her all the time,
you know, "Go, have fun."

20:55.421 --> 20:58.965
But... I think she's lost
a lot of friends lately.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.049
Hmm...

21:00.551 --> 21:02.719
Their father died under a cloud,

21:02.803 --> 21:05.597
and kids can be really cruel.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.353
I don't mean to get all heavy on you.
Sorry.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.479
That's okay.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.273
Hey, Mom said to do your homework.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.083
Get out of my room!

21:16.107 --> 21:19.528
I love 'em, but sometimes
I would love it if they weren't here.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.155
Oh, shit.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.617
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- I didn't...

21:25.701 --> 21:27.887
- Hey, it's all right. I get it.
- ...mean it like that.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.245
You know, you...

21:29.330 --> 21:31.915
...you got a lot on your plate.
You're on your own and, uh...

21:31.998 --> 21:34.335
I just... You know,
I'm sorry your old man,

21:34.418 --> 21:36.378
he... he let you down
the way he did. I...

21:37.796 --> 21:41.091
That's an ugly thing to say
about someone you don't even know.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.511
You don't know anything
about it or him.

21:45.178 --> 21:49.182
Being pissed off at David doesn't mean
that I don't miss him like crazy.

21:50.642 --> 21:54.062
You're right.
That's fair enough. I apologize.

21:55.271 --> 21:57.148
Look, I... Look, I'm sorry. I'm...

21:57.232 --> 21:59.693
- No, I...
- I'm gonna get out of your hair, okay?

22:03.447 --> 22:06.032
Hey, Sarah, you know,
why don't you, um...

22:07.117 --> 22:08.827
Why don't you let me fix that headlight?

22:08.910 --> 22:12.414
You know, then you don't have to deal
with any insurance, any deductibles,

22:12.498 --> 22:14.541
- any of that nonsense, you know.
- I hit you,

22:14.625 --> 22:17.127
you fixed my garage,
and now you're gonna fix my car?

22:17.210 --> 22:19.647
- You... I can't let you do that.
- Look, I want to, all right?

22:19.671 --> 22:22.466
- I don't need your charity, Pete.
- Honestly. I get it, but I insist.

22:22.549 --> 22:23.550
Okay? Just...

22:23.634 --> 22:26.678
Come on. Keep me busy, all right?

22:27.471 --> 22:28.472
Please.

22:30.932 --> 22:31.933
All right.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.578
Yeah, all right.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.020
- All right.
- I'll see you.

22:35.103 --> 22:36.354
See you around.

22:39.608 --> 22:41.026
Each of you...

22:41.860 --> 22:45.447
trained as part of the finest
fighting force in the world.

22:46.656 --> 22:47.783
Now...

22:49.075 --> 22:50.661
what do you think that that cost?

22:51.578 --> 22:53.872
From the moment that you walked
in the recruiting office

22:53.955 --> 22:56.458
to the moment
that you took your first duty station.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.711
What do you think? I'll tell you.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.506
$50,000.

23:02.589 --> 23:05.050
And that's just...
that's just for starters.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.595
Say you're, uh, Special Forces?

23:08.678 --> 23:10.639
$150,000, minimum.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.518
Corpsman? Add another 200K.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.896
So this government, our country,

23:17.979 --> 23:22.025
the one that you all swore to protect,
invested in you.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.779
And you all... you all invested, too.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.032
You invested time...

23:31.201 --> 23:32.202
your lives.

23:33.119 --> 23:36.247
Ask yourself,
what are you doing with that investment?

23:36.331 --> 23:39.626
Is anybody here making $100,000 a year?

23:39.710 --> 23:42.170
Yeah, I wish.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.173
You making 50K a year? 40?

23:46.633 --> 23:49.052
No, no...

23:50.053 --> 23:51.096
no.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.224
Why?

23:55.809 --> 23:56.852
Why is that?

23:56.935 --> 24:00.730
Is it... Is it because
you're not worth the investment?

24:01.106 --> 24:02.232
No.

24:02.315 --> 24:04.234
It's because your skills

24:04.317 --> 24:08.279
are not matched to the tasks
available to you here at home.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.657
It's that simple. You are fighters!

24:10.741 --> 24:13.118
And here at Anvil,
you will have the opportunity

24:13.201 --> 24:14.828
to fight for a living.

24:15.203 --> 24:17.205
And you will be well compensated.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.542
Now... I know...

24:22.252 --> 24:23.252
I know.

24:23.419 --> 24:28.466
I'm not here offering you just money.

24:29.718 --> 24:35.098
I mean, not a... not a single one of us
joined up to make a fortune, right?

24:37.183 --> 24:41.897
It's because we didn't want our lives
to be just...

24:44.065 --> 24:45.316
gray.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.904
We wanted them to mean something.

24:49.905 --> 24:54.535
We wanted to be a part of something
bigger than ourselves!

24:55.452 --> 24:58.205
And here at Anvil, if you are recruited...

24:58.747 --> 25:00.957
you will find that something.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.377
A new brotherhood to call your own.
Something to fight for.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.257
To live for... even.

25:16.389 --> 25:18.975
Okay...

25:24.815 --> 25:28.193
The exchange is set for tomorrow
at a warehouse on the docks.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.278
Agent Sampson is our buyer.

25:30.862 --> 25:34.908
Snipers will post here, here and here.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.452
Our seller is coming in from Newark
by road.

25:37.535 --> 25:39.204
Bowers and Sinclair will make sure

25:39.287 --> 25:41.808
that the weapons make it off the boat
and then follow them across.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.250
No engagement from the follow car,
no matter what happens.

25:44.334 --> 25:46.127
The second the money exchanges hands,

25:46.211 --> 25:49.798
the arrest team moves in quick,
clean, tie it up in a bow

25:49.881 --> 25:51.382
and ready for the US attorney.

25:51.466 --> 25:52.634
Any questions?

25:52.717 --> 25:54.553
Your sniper spacing's off.

25:55.386 --> 25:58.974
They don't have clean lines
unless your van parks exactly here.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.183
Move them to the corners,

26:00.266 --> 26:01.994
- you've got both sides of the warehouse.
- Fair enough.

26:02.018 --> 26:05.313
And you need a dedicated comm line
to the snipers.

26:05.396 --> 26:07.232
My team... Sorry, your team,

26:07.315 --> 26:09.234
will be the only ones
with eyes on the buy.

26:09.317 --> 26:10.819
Follow will be too far away,

26:10.902 --> 26:13.502
and calling the shot from the ops trailer
is begging for disaster.

26:13.780 --> 26:15.115
And call Harbor Patrol.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.884
See if you can get a boat
to cover the water exit.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.243
Just in case.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.664
I'm done.

26:25.083 --> 26:28.003
Thank you, everybody. Let's go to work.

26:32.590 --> 26:34.134
So, uh, just curious...

26:34.718 --> 26:37.971
- Did I get anything right?
- Come on, Stein.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.390
It was good. I just made it better.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.600
As the SAC should.

26:42.684 --> 26:44.060
Wait a second.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.647
Is that why Hernandez was here?
To make it official?

26:46.730 --> 26:51.192
Rafi was here to make sure I toe the line.
He's a black belt in carrot and stick.

26:51.860 --> 26:53.987
Nice guy to have watching your back.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.910
You know,
when they first started Homeland,

26:59.993 --> 27:01.286
they wanted native speakers.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.163
Farsi, Pashtun, Arabic.

27:03.246 --> 27:06.625
The thinking was simple:
use the enemy to catch the enemy.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.669
But Rafi wasn't like that.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.213
I grew up on the Upper West Side.
We speak Farsi at home,

27:12.297 --> 27:15.133
but I never considered myself
anything but American.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.261
When he recruited me, he said,

27:18.344 --> 27:21.389
"There are contributions and insights
only you can make,

27:21.472 --> 27:24.184
and without them
the agency will be lacking."

27:25.060 --> 27:27.437
And I... I believed him.

27:28.855 --> 27:29.856
And now?

27:33.777 --> 27:35.028
This is a good case.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.657
It'll take a lot of guns off the street.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.202
You should be proud
of the work you've done.

27:46.831 --> 27:47.831
Hey.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.418
Thanks, boss.

28:01.012 --> 28:03.306
Two minutes to finish this or you flunk.

28:03.389 --> 28:05.767
Come on, you got this.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.686
- Ten more and you're done.
- Okay.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.772
- Get back up there.
- Okay. Okay.

28:13.441 --> 28:16.111
Hey, come on, man.
We're too close not to do this.

28:17.904 --> 28:20.132
- Push it. You got more.
- I don't know if I got any more.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.534
You got more. Come on.

28:23.326 --> 28:25.620
Let's do them together, come on.
Come on.

28:25.704 --> 28:28.081
Yeah? Okay. Okay, here...

28:28.164 --> 28:32.001
One. Two.

28:32.085 --> 28:34.087
- Three.
- Two!

28:34.170 --> 28:36.714
- Four. Five.
- Three!

28:39.926 --> 28:42.262
When was the last time
you tuned this guitar?

28:43.596 --> 28:45.265
I got it at a pawn shop.

28:45.932 --> 28:49.019
Thought it might help pass the time.
I could teach myself.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.687
Turns out I suck at guitar.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.737
All it takes is a little dedication.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.739
You gonna start talking
about the dog again?

29:06.411 --> 29:07.703
Hey, Santana.

29:08.454 --> 29:09.956
I found your guns.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.752
Now you're talking.

29:14.252 --> 29:16.922
Who's buying 'em?

29:17.005 --> 29:19.340
- Homeland Security.
- Homeland?

29:19.424 --> 29:22.218
Yeah.
See, I've been reading e-mails all night.

29:22.302 --> 29:24.971
NYPD, ATF, Customs,
they've all been warned off.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.158
The Greeks think
they're going to meet a criminal buyer.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.724
Homeland's gonna roll 'em up.

29:28.809 --> 29:31.477
Got their tactical plans right here.

29:33.479 --> 29:36.942
Snipers... uh, follow cars...

29:37.650 --> 29:39.735
assault teams... It's pretty heavy.

29:42.363 --> 29:44.199
We're gonna need a ride.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.876
Oh, guess he's dead.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.396
Get him out of here.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.343
Now I'm gonna take that gag out.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.929
If you scream, you die. That's it.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.639
You don't have to start, you know,
sayin' a bunch of weird shit.

30:08.723 --> 30:11.351
That's what Joe did. Don't be like Joe.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.730
All right, all right, all right.

30:15.814 --> 30:16.894
There you go. Easy.

30:19.442 --> 30:23.279
All I wanna know is...

30:23.363 --> 30:26.032
Gabi?

30:27.200 --> 30:28.785
Gabi's not coming back.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.123
Brother, you are in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.665
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

30:39.838 --> 30:42.382
You know how a guy misses a shot
from ten yards?

30:44.134 --> 30:48.179
Cortisol. See, it floods the body
when you're stressed.

30:48.263 --> 30:50.891
Makes your muscles tighter,
reactions quicker.

30:50.974 --> 30:53.018
But you put those two things together...

30:53.101 --> 30:54.101
You see that?

30:56.646 --> 30:59.399
A little shake, plus a little distance...

31:00.566 --> 31:02.318
You miss.

31:10.076 --> 31:11.327
Shoot that asshole!

31:14.915 --> 31:16.666
Move around! Go back!

31:28.636 --> 31:29.971
Shit!

31:30.055 --> 31:31.139
Psst, hey!

31:39.689 --> 31:41.649
Oh, God. Oh, God...

31:41.732 --> 31:44.610
- Please...
- I guess that was a dud, huh?

31:44.694 --> 31:47.363
Please, I don't know who you are, man.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.991
- Just let me go. I didn't see...
- Shut up.

31:57.415 --> 31:58.541
There's a, uh...

31:59.250 --> 32:00.543
uh...

32:01.127 --> 32:02.629
dead man in a...

32:02.712 --> 32:03.922
...wheelbarrow out there.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.299
Yeah. I didn't do that.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.801
You do this?

32:08.885 --> 32:11.387
- Yeah, I did this 'cause they did that.
- Yeah.

32:13.139 --> 32:14.866
- What, are you gonna puke?
- I'm not gonna...

32:14.890 --> 32:18.311
Hey! Do not leave your DNA
for the police, all right? Just...

32:18.895 --> 32:20.772
- Hey, don't do... Hey.
- Give me a second!

32:22.565 --> 32:24.943
Said you wanted to be
the guidance system, right?

32:25.026 --> 32:27.903
Well, this is what happens
when the missile goes off.

32:27.987 --> 32:31.491
- Guess you never thought about that.
- Smells more than I thought.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.035
- You get used to it.
- I'd rather not.

32:34.119 --> 32:36.997
Guess life's a little easier
staring at a computer screen, huh?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.083
Now you get in that van, and let's go.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.709
What about him?

32:41.792 --> 32:43.211
Not our problem.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.298
All this, you're taking the Mustang?

32:47.382 --> 32:48.883
Always buy American.

32:57.308 --> 32:59.019
You sure about this?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.104
He's living in a foxhole in his yard.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.023
And he almost put a bullet in his father.

33:03.564 --> 33:05.233
Hell, who hasn't wanted to do that?

33:10.613 --> 33:12.657
Maybe he just needs to get back into it.

33:13.074 --> 33:16.286
The kid wants to live in a tent,
I can give that to him.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.745
Listen to me.

33:17.828 --> 33:20.206
You won't be doing him
or yourself any favors

33:20.290 --> 33:22.208
if you put him in combat situations.

33:23.209 --> 33:27.172
I'm telling you, man, if I was out there,
I wouldn't want that kid watching my six.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.091
And a team is only as good
as its weakest link, right?

33:30.675 --> 33:31.843
And this one would snap?

33:32.843 --> 33:34.220
Only a matter of time.

33:35.471 --> 33:37.682
So what happens when I cut him loose?

33:40.476 --> 33:42.979
You do your part, and I'll do mine.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.649
All right, brother.

33:53.989 --> 33:56.201
All right,
so I escorted a resupply line

33:56.284 --> 33:58.286
to you guys in Mosul a couple of times.

33:59.329 --> 34:01.539
We could have been there
at the same time.

34:01.622 --> 34:04.625
- Wilson! Can I have a word?
- Yes, sir.

34:06.961 --> 34:08.795
- It's Lewis, right?
- Yes, sir.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.217
What's with the foxhole
in your backyard, Lewis?

34:17.638 --> 34:19.056
I don't, uh...

34:20.349 --> 34:21.641
What do you mean?

34:22.643 --> 34:25.188
Well, I gotta know what's going on
with all my guys.

34:25.771 --> 34:28.149
Lives depend on it. You know?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.735
It was a...

34:31.694 --> 34:33.446
...a project.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.117
Something to keep me busy.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.994
And what do you figure
the other guys would think?

34:40.745 --> 34:44.081
If I told them that the guy
watching their backs was living like that?

34:45.166 --> 34:47.668
It's nothing, sir. I'm fine.

34:48.543 --> 34:53.257
Listen, this...
this business is all based on trust.

34:53.841 --> 34:54.967
Please don't do this.

34:57.678 --> 35:00.140
I'm sorry, man.
I... I can't take the risk.

35:07.647 --> 35:09.482
Was this... was this Curtis?

35:10.066 --> 35:13.361
I gotta check up on all our prospects.
For just this kinda thing.

35:13.444 --> 35:16.281
- It's got nothing to do with Curtis.
- You saying it wasn't him?

35:17.823 --> 35:20.618
I'm saying that it doesn't matter.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.787
I don't believe you.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.540
He told me not to come here,
and then he spikes me.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.625
- He's a goddamn snake.
- Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.252
I don't know you, kid.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.628
Now, Curtis Hoyle,

35:30.711 --> 35:33.047
he saved my ass on more than one occasion.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.841
One of the best men I ever had
the good fortune of serving with.

35:35.925 --> 35:38.886
Lewis, if you need work,

35:38.969 --> 35:41.931
I promise you I will find you
something to do around here.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.142
Are you gonna give me a job
mopping floors?

35:44.809 --> 35:46.352
Emptying trash?

35:47.812 --> 35:51.482
Is that making good on the investment
my country made in me?

35:55.611 --> 35:58.030
You're just another liar in command.

35:58.113 --> 35:59.865
Okay.

35:59.949 --> 36:01.867
Okay, we're done. You need to leave.

36:06.914 --> 36:07.914
Now.

36:18.092 --> 36:19.885
Your brotherhood is bullshit.

36:30.104 --> 36:31.731
Command, this is Decoy One.

36:31.814 --> 36:34.775
I'm in position at meeting point.
All clear. No surprises.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.444
Copy that, Sampson.

36:36.527 --> 36:40.114
Tactical One, Sniper One, Sniper Two...
Decoy One is in position.

36:40.198 --> 36:43.075
We are 60 minutes from go-no-go
at the meeting point.

36:43.158 --> 36:44.952
- Stay sharp.
- This is Decoy One.

36:45.035 --> 36:46.204
Copy that, Command.

36:46.287 --> 36:48.539
This is Sniper One.
Sharp and ready, ma'am.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.666
This is Sniper Two, copy that.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.431
Let's go.

37:09.143 --> 37:11.771
- I can't do this.
- Oh, Jesus.

37:19.237 --> 37:23.032
Well... see, it's a two-man job, so...

37:23.115 --> 37:24.784
- you don't have a choice.
- Hmm?

37:24.867 --> 37:25.868
Yeah.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.663
I sit behind a screen.

37:29.455 --> 37:31.081
I don't do this.

37:31.957 --> 37:34.209
- You shouldn't trust me.
- You done?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.297
Pick up your shit and let's move.

37:46.013 --> 37:49.392
So this is it, huh?
This is... this is what Sarah meant?

37:50.643 --> 37:51.644
Excuse me?

37:52.228 --> 37:53.228
Your wife...

37:54.730 --> 37:58.109
She said that you never got
your hands dirty. Right?

37:58.401 --> 38:01.153
If there was a tough job,
what you'd do is you'd make a phone call.

38:01.237 --> 38:02.238
You'd call a guy.

38:09.036 --> 38:10.455
Pissed off, huh?

38:12.247 --> 38:14.917
- You're a prick.
- Yeah. Attaboy.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.338
Pissed off beats scared every time.

38:18.421 --> 38:21.716
Command, this is Tactical One.
We are in position and ready for target.

38:21.799 --> 38:23.343
Sniper One? Sniper Two?

38:23.426 --> 38:25.446
- In position.
- In position.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.389
Sniper One, Sniper Two, Tactical One...
wagon's on the move.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.933
Estimated ten minutes
till it gets to the corral.

38:31.016 --> 38:32.416
Copy that, Command.

38:32.477 --> 38:36.021
- Copy that, Command.
- Copy that, Command.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.944
Follow One, we are ten minutes
from go-no-go at the meeting point.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.405
Copy that, Command.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.866
We have eyes on target
and are proceeding to meeting point.

38:46.949 --> 38:48.743
Copy that, Follow One. Hold tight.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.370
Calm and careful.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.829
Copy that, Command.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.948
Sniper One.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.349
What the...

39:11.432 --> 39:12.808
Follow One, can you read me?

39:16.729 --> 39:17.730
Oh, shit!

39:18.981 --> 39:20.941
Follow One, can you read me?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.234
Follow One, please respond.

39:22.317 --> 39:24.295
- Call it in.
- I can't. It's jammed.

39:24.319 --> 39:26.321
♪ Ooh ♪

39:27.239 --> 39:28.866

39:28.949 --> 39:30.535

39:33.454 --> 39:36.374

39:36.457 --> 39:39.293
Repeat, please respond.
We've lost ears, people.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.462
- Hey!

39:41.546 --> 39:44.882
Sam? Do you copy? Please respond.

Shit!

39:47.635 --> 39:48.635

39:50.304 --> 39:51.597
Stay after him.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.279
- What am I listening to?
- They don't know.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.163
- Some kind of interference.
- What do you mean?

39:58.187 --> 39:59.730
- Sam, just be ready.
- Do we abort?

39:59.814 --> 40:01.356
No, follow car is still go.

40:01.441 --> 40:02.900
Stay in position. We do this deaf.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.823
- Dinah...
- Stay in position. That's an order.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.896
Drop your guns! Turn around!

40:41.481 --> 40:43.107
You see that water?

40:43.691 --> 40:44.817
Five seconds.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.778
You get really hot or really wet.
You choose.

40:58.038 --> 41:00.875
Is there any way we can turn that down?

41:00.958 --> 41:02.417
Son of a bitch.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.006
That's the second time
the truck's passed there.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.674
It's a loop.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.801
Someone's feeding us a goddamn loop.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.970
Take the van.

41:22.312 --> 41:24.458
Stein, something's up.
Something's happened to the truck.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.025
They were last at pier nine.

41:26.108 --> 41:27.461
- I'm heading there.
- I don't understand.

41:27.485 --> 41:28.670
- What do you mean...
- Get there.

41:28.694 --> 41:30.334
It's being ripped off.

42:12.446 --> 42:14.156
Frank, we got company.

42:17.618 --> 42:20.037
You head for the highway.
I'll cut 'em off.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.961
What's happening?

42:27.044 --> 42:28.764
Keep driving.
You know where to go.

45:22.845 --> 45:24.805
- What did you do?
- What did I do?

45:24.889 --> 45:25.931
Yeah.

45:26.015 --> 45:27.682
- What did I do?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:28.475 --> 45:32.354
What did I do? I got my hands...
I got my hands dirty, you piece of shit!

45:32.437 --> 45:33.898
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey!
