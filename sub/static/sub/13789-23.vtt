♪♪

00:05.436 --> 00:08.679
I promise, this will
only take a second.

00:08.679 --> 00:10.541
ALL: Surprise!

00:10.541 --> 00:13.284
Oh, my gosh!
What's the occasion?

00:13.284 --> 00:15.546
I can't believe you don't
remember what today is.

00:15.546 --> 00:19.320
I know what today is.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.392
I wouldn't forget
an important day like today.

00:21.392 --> 00:22.423
It's--

00:22.423 --> 00:23.424
The anniversary--

00:23.424 --> 00:24.495
The anniversary--

00:24.495 --> 00:26.457
Of--
Of--

00:26.457 --> 00:28.259
The day...
The day...

00:28.259 --> 00:29.300
I can't
take this anymore.

00:29.300 --> 00:32.333
I can't take this anymore--

00:32.333 --> 00:35.436
Stan,
it's our anniversary.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.808
Remember when you joined
our family three years ago?

00:37.808 --> 00:39.710
Of course I do.

00:39.710 --> 00:41.842
It was the most
special day of my life.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.474
Along with my wedding day

00:43.474 --> 00:45.616
and the day
my puppies were born.

00:45.616 --> 00:46.877
And the day I felt bad

00:46.877 --> 00:48.579
because I forgot
our anniversary.

00:48.579 --> 00:50.281
That's today.

00:52.253 --> 00:54.455
We got you presents.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.826
Your favorite
dog treats.

00:55.826 --> 00:57.458
And a new chew toy.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.090
Thanks, guys.

00:59.090 --> 01:00.691
This is fantastic!

01:00.691 --> 01:03.094
I'm going to start
chewing him right now.

01:03.094 --> 01:04.335
( toy squeaks )

01:07.498 --> 01:09.370
Oh, hello, Robert.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.802
This just got very awkward.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.109
So now the credit card
company is saying

01:18.109 --> 01:20.411
that a piano
was charged to my card.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.513
I didn't buy a piano.
Did you buy a piano?

01:22.513 --> 01:23.584
Of course I didn't
buy a piano.

01:23.584 --> 01:24.755
Why would I buy a piano?

01:24.755 --> 01:26.387
And where is this piano?

01:29.160 --> 01:30.991
STAN: Come on,
move out of the way.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.524
I need to get the kids'
anniversary present upstairs.

01:33.524 --> 01:35.396
And this keeps
happening.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.568
Who keeps charging
these things to our card?

01:37.568 --> 01:40.070
I'm as confused by
all these charges are you are.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.632
I mean, a hang glider,

01:41.632 --> 01:43.534
two hundred
pounds of bacon,

01:43.534 --> 01:46.707
a subscription
to Poodle Lovers magazine?

01:46.707 --> 01:49.480
You're the impulse shopper!
If you think...

01:49.480 --> 01:52.283
Oh, no. The rope
is starting to break. (barks)

01:52.283 --> 01:54.785
Not now, Stan.
We're having a problem
with a piano.

01:54.785 --> 01:56.747
It's going
to fall on you!

01:56.747 --> 01:58.449
Get out of the way!

02:02.593 --> 02:04.425
Are you okay, honey?

02:04.425 --> 02:05.956
I think so,
are you o--

02:08.959 --> 02:11.662
Did...Stan just talk?

02:11.662 --> 02:13.464
Uh, no.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.506
I mean, woof.

02:16.507 --> 02:18.509
He did it again.

02:26.317 --> 02:28.549
Yeah, the kids reacted
pretty much the same way

02:28.549 --> 02:29.980
when they found out.

02:47.838 --> 02:51.802
You've talked
this whole time?

02:51.802 --> 02:53.444
Yes.

02:53.444 --> 02:56.447
All those times we heard
someone talking,

02:56.447 --> 02:59.179
like on Halloween,
that was you?

02:59.179 --> 03:02.213
Yes. And will you
stop poking me?

03:04.915 --> 03:08.589
Wait, were you the voice I heard
whispering from the kitchen

03:08.589 --> 03:10.591
telling me
to eat more cake?

03:10.591 --> 03:14.225
No, I'm the voice that whispers,
"Make a steak."

03:14.225 --> 03:15.866
But I guess you hear
what you want to hear.

03:17.167 --> 03:18.969
And Ian.

03:18.969 --> 03:20.671
When he said
you were a talking dog

03:20.671 --> 03:21.972
he wasn't crazy.

03:21.972 --> 03:23.734
Nope.
Just evil.

03:23.734 --> 03:25.236
And a little ticklish.

03:25.236 --> 03:26.677
But evil ticklish.

03:26.677 --> 03:27.938
You tickle him
and he goes...

03:27.938 --> 03:29.510
( evil laugh )

03:32.483 --> 03:34.084
Gracie, Freddy.

03:34.084 --> 03:36.487
Bennett and Ellen know.

03:36.487 --> 03:37.888
It's okay to talk
to them now.

03:37.888 --> 03:39.820
Hi, Gammaw and Gamps.

03:39.820 --> 03:42.393
I eat rabbit poop
in the yard.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.996
The puppies talk too?

03:45.996 --> 03:48.529
And they call me "Gammaw"?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.501
Where's the cake?

03:52.132 --> 03:53.664
Well, once you learned
I can talk,

03:53.664 --> 03:55.636
is it really such a surprise
about the puppies?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.539
Crazy, huh, Robert?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.070
Robert talks too?

04:00.070 --> 04:03.744
Does he call me "Gammaw?!"

04:03.744 --> 04:05.816
So after all these years,

04:05.816 --> 04:08.649
Bennett and Ellen
finally found out.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.481
I have to say,
I'm relieved the pressure

04:10.481 --> 04:12.583
of keeping the secret
is finally off.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.526
TOGETHER:
You write a blog, too?

04:20.991 --> 04:22.763
Hey, kids.
How was school?

04:22.763 --> 04:23.994
Great.
Good.

04:23.994 --> 04:25.766
I don't
go to school anymore.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.599
So there's nothing
you want to tell us about?

04:28.599 --> 04:31.602
No secret you think
it might be time to share?

04:31.602 --> 04:32.773
Nope.
Nothing.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.505
I didn't go to school
today either.

04:35.746 --> 04:37.748
See? I told you guys.

04:37.748 --> 04:39.680
The kids would never
keep a secret from you.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.782
You were right, Stan.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.213
Yeah.
Should've listened to you.

04:43.213 --> 04:44.685
What do we do?!
I don't know!

04:44.685 --> 04:46.717
I'm pretty sure they can hear
everything we're saying!

04:46.717 --> 04:47.758
Of course they can!

04:47.758 --> 04:49.660
We're standing
right behind them!

04:52.693 --> 04:55.726
So, the dog talks.

04:55.726 --> 04:57.498
Kinda weird.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.870
You guys are
terrible at this.

04:59.870 --> 05:02.773
How did you keep this a secret
from us for three years?

05:02.773 --> 05:05.035
You have no idea
what we went through.

05:05.035 --> 05:06.507
Tricking your
book editor--

05:06.507 --> 05:07.908
Donating
all the Christmas presents--

05:07.908 --> 05:10.681
And I delivered puppies
as a French doctor.

05:10.681 --> 05:13.714
( speaking French )

05:13.714 --> 05:15.746
TOGETHER:
You speak French?!

05:21.722 --> 05:23.954
So long are we
gonna stand here?

05:23.954 --> 05:26.827
I made a sandwich.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.729
I wouldn't even be
freaking out like this

05:28.729 --> 05:31.101
over Tyler speaking French
if I weren't so off balance

05:31.101 --> 05:33.764
because the dog talks!

05:33.764 --> 05:35.836
Why did you kids
never tell us about this?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.307
We were afraid
you'd send

05:37.307 --> 05:39.840
Stan away to be
experimented on.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.842
It's been
our biggest fear.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.815
Oh, kids, I guess
I can understand

05:44.815 --> 05:46.677
why you would be
concerned about that.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.449
But don't worry.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.681
Now that we see how important
Stan is to you,

05:50.681 --> 05:52.853
we would never let anything
like that happen.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.954
Thanks, guys.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.255
Thanks, Mom.

05:56.827 --> 05:59.259
Stan is a pretty special dog,
isn't he?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.131
You know,
it's because of Stan

06:01.131 --> 06:03.734
that the three of us
have become such good friends

06:03.734 --> 06:05.095
over these last few years.

06:05.095 --> 06:06.737
Yeah, I pretty much
raised them.

06:06.737 --> 06:07.838
You're welcome.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.901
Excuse me, Robert.
I need some coffee.

06:10.901 --> 06:13.103
Uh, Mom,
Robert doesn't actually talk.

06:13.103 --> 06:14.605
He's just Stan's chew toy.

06:14.605 --> 06:16.106
Well how am I supposed
to know what talks

06:16.106 --> 06:17.708
and what doesn't talk
around here?

06:17.708 --> 06:19.109
Does the coffee maker
talk?

06:19.109 --> 06:21.612
Maybe.
I don't know!

06:21.612 --> 06:22.613
I do talk, Ellen.

06:22.613 --> 06:24.515
I also do espresso.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.588
Nah, that was just me.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.790
I also throw
my voice a little.

06:34.825 --> 06:36.296
Karl!
Great news!

06:36.296 --> 06:37.498
Stan, wait--

06:37.498 --> 06:38.699
I'm too happy to wait.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.731
Bennett and Ellen
know I can talk

06:40.731 --> 06:42.733
and they are
totally cool with it!

06:42.733 --> 06:45.736
Stan, my father is back
from the space station.

06:45.736 --> 06:47.237
That's great, Karl.

06:47.237 --> 06:49.109
And he's fixing my TV.

06:52.242 --> 06:54.645
I was in space
on a top secret mission

06:54.645 --> 06:56.346
searching for alien life.

06:56.346 --> 06:59.289
What a surprise that when
I finally encountered it,

06:59.289 --> 07:01.552
it would be
in my son's shed.

07:02.793 --> 07:06.126
I believe he prefers
to call it his lair,

07:06.126 --> 07:08.759
and I realize that should
probably not be my take-away

07:08.759 --> 07:10.761
from what you just said.

07:12.763 --> 07:15.135
I can't believe those guys
from the space program

07:15.135 --> 07:16.667
took us out of our house.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.208
And put us in this
exact copy of our house

07:18.208 --> 07:19.470
so they could observe us.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.475
Why are they doing this?

07:24.475 --> 07:27.377
I think they want to observe us
in our natural habitat.

07:27.377 --> 07:28.849
There's nothing
natural about it.

07:28.849 --> 07:30.350
There's only one channel
on this TV.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.682
That's us.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.884
They have us
on closed circuit TV.

07:38.358 --> 07:40.190
Still, a family
with a talking dog?

07:40.190 --> 07:41.592
That's a good show!

07:43.233 --> 07:44.935
Well, I am not
just going to sit here

07:44.935 --> 07:46.236
and let them do this to us.

07:46.236 --> 07:47.768
Hey!

07:47.768 --> 07:50.300
Hey, you let us out of here!

07:50.300 --> 07:53.203
No force field's gonna
keep me back!

07:53.203 --> 07:54.444
Hey, come on!

07:54.444 --> 07:55.776
Hey, guys!

07:55.776 --> 07:57.978
( all yelling )

08:04.254 --> 08:07.057
( all yelling )

08:07.057 --> 08:09.289
Knockedy.
Knockedy.

08:10.861 --> 08:12.863
What do you want with us,
Colonel Fink?

08:12.863 --> 08:15.125
Stan and the puppies
are clearly aliens.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.828
What other explanation
can there be for their talking?

08:17.828 --> 08:20.300
So they are now property
of the US Space Command

08:20.300 --> 08:21.972
Secret Aliens Division.

08:21.972 --> 08:23.874
We at the SAD--
Sad?

08:23.874 --> 08:27.237
We used to be,
but now we found aliens.

08:27.237 --> 08:29.880
We will study them
and question them to find out

08:29.880 --> 08:32.312
what planet they are from
and why they're here.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.644
You can't do this!

08:33.644 --> 08:35.115
We can and we will.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.648
The SAD will be able
to get budget increases.

08:37.648 --> 08:40.090
We'll finally get a foosball
table for the break room.

08:40.090 --> 08:41.221
First game!

08:41.221 --> 08:42.953
You guys heard that.

08:44.094 --> 08:45.826
How long are you going
to keep us for?

08:45.826 --> 08:47.998
You aliens
will never be set free.

08:47.998 --> 08:50.000
The rest of you
must be kept here

08:50.000 --> 08:51.832
until we can determine
if you're aliens too.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.503
And if you're willing
to keep our plans

08:53.503 --> 08:55.005
for a foosball
table secret.

08:55.005 --> 08:55.966
We don't want
those weasels

08:55.966 --> 08:57.838
at Health and Human
Services whining,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.970
"They got one,
why can't we have one?"

09:02.272 --> 09:03.774
So, Stan, tell me.

09:03.774 --> 09:04.945
What planet
are you from?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.146
Clearly you're
not an earth dog.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.018
Earth dogs don't talk.

09:08.018 --> 09:09.950
They do if they time
traveled from a future

09:09.950 --> 09:11.421
where all animals talk

09:11.421 --> 09:13.784
and humans are kept
as pets and duckways.

09:13.784 --> 09:14.985
What's a duckway?

09:14.985 --> 09:16.026
About four pounds.

09:16.026 --> 09:17.888
What?! Up top!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.391
If you give us treats,

09:21.391 --> 09:23.193
we'll tell you
everything we know.

09:23.193 --> 09:25.035
Very good then.

09:26.496 --> 09:28.739
One, two, three,
four, five.

09:28.739 --> 09:31.301
A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.103
A cow says "Mooo."

09:33.103 --> 09:35.105
A sheep says "Baaaa."

09:35.105 --> 09:37.077
That's everything we know.

09:39.349 --> 09:40.811
I can't believe
you fell for "duckway."

09:40.811 --> 09:42.282
That's such a henfer.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.984
What's a henfer?
Laying eggs.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.185
Woo! Up top!

09:46.987 --> 09:49.019
I don't do
well in captivity.

09:49.019 --> 09:50.160
Little known
fact about me,

09:50.160 --> 09:52.893
as a child I was trapped
in the aviary at the zoo.

09:52.893 --> 09:55.225
I spent a weekend in there
before anyone noticed.

09:55.225 --> 09:57.768
It was hawk-ward.

09:57.768 --> 09:58.899
Good one, Ellen.

09:58.899 --> 10:00.100
If we don't get
out of here,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.032
that could be
my final "good one."

10:03.303 --> 10:05.776
If only I could believe
that were true.

10:05.776 --> 10:09.339
We just found out about
the dogs talking ourselves.

10:09.339 --> 10:11.712
And that they were charging
things to our credit card.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.884
I gave a thousand dollars
to a charity called

10:13.884 --> 10:15.946
"Bacon Wrapped Cats."

10:15.946 --> 10:18.919
I'm taking the deduction.
But what is that?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.520
I'm getting
nowhere with you.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.322
I'm going to interrogate
the girls.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.394
I think the girls went off
to the bathroom.

10:24.394 --> 10:26.526
Those toilets are fake.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.929
Girls,
the toilets are fake!

10:28.929 --> 10:30.630
AVERY:
Information that would've been

10:30.630 --> 10:33.063
good to have
five minutes ago!

10:33.063 --> 10:36.036
CHLOE: This show's
taking a weird turn!

10:37.938 --> 10:38.969
Colonel Fink,

10:38.969 --> 10:41.071
we'll be taking over here.

10:41.071 --> 10:42.312
I believe these papers
make it clear

10:42.312 --> 10:44.514
that the Army now
has jurisdiction.

10:44.514 --> 10:46.677
My foosball table.

10:46.677 --> 10:48.118
I was going to paint
faces on the players

10:48.118 --> 10:50.821
to look like the gang
at Space Command.

10:50.821 --> 10:52.322
It's not weird.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.385
We will be using
Stan to breed

10:55.385 --> 10:57.287
a commando force
of talking dogs,

10:57.287 --> 10:58.689
which will have
the unique ability

10:58.689 --> 11:00.590
to infiltrate
behind enemy lines.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.562
I'm conflicted.

11:02.562 --> 11:04.765
On the one hand,
I want my freedom.

11:04.765 --> 11:08.438
On the other hand,
commanding a talking dog army.

11:08.438 --> 11:10.971
I could finally
use my commando crawl.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.043
Thusly.

11:13.043 --> 11:16.046
Imagine a whole army
coming at you like this.

11:19.149 --> 11:21.511
All right, men,
let's get set up.

11:21.511 --> 11:24.184
Not so fast.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.186
We'll be taking over here.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.557
I believe these papers
make it clear

11:27.557 --> 11:29.159
that I now have
jurisdiction.

11:29.159 --> 11:31.121
My secret dog army.

11:31.121 --> 11:33.123
We wasted five years
and four trillion dollars

11:33.123 --> 11:35.896
perfecting camouflage
poop bags.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.970
( all muttering )

11:39.970 --> 11:42.532
Ian, what are
you doing here?

11:42.532 --> 11:45.105
Thought you'd seen
the last of me, did you?

11:45.105 --> 11:46.807
Well, I was able to convince
the government

11:46.807 --> 11:50.010
to fund my talking
animal research.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.042
Actually, it's a line item
in a thousand page omnibus bill

11:52.042 --> 11:54.885
that no one's read,
but I have my funding.

11:54.885 --> 11:58.048
And funding for these poop bags
with my face on them.

12:00.350 --> 12:03.023
They also gave me
money to build this.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.558
Just turn the force field off
and go around.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.262
It's a device
to transfer the ability

12:12.262 --> 12:14.364
to talk from one animal
to another.

12:14.364 --> 12:17.768
I've never had an animal
to test it on until now.

12:17.768 --> 12:19.409
So I don't even know
if it works--

12:19.409 --> 12:20.971
but I'm hopeful.

12:20.971 --> 12:22.973
Why didn't you
test it on yourself?

12:22.973 --> 12:26.276
You don't test a talking animal
machine on a person.

12:26.276 --> 12:27.347
Why not?

12:28.418 --> 12:30.420
You just don't, okay?!

12:37.988 --> 12:40.230
Mom and Dad are trying
to talk some sense into Ian.

12:40.230 --> 12:41.561
What are you doing,
Stan?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.763
Trying to figure
out this machine.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.136
I've learned a lot from Karl
hanging out in his shed.

12:46.136 --> 12:48.138
These components look
similar to something

12:48.138 --> 12:51.071
he was working on,
only his was a machine

12:51.071 --> 12:53.373
that would give him
the cool appeal of a hipster.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.445
His first attempt
went horribly wrong.

12:55.445 --> 12:57.047
He grew a handlebar
mustache--

12:57.047 --> 12:59.649
unfortunately,
it was on his butt.

13:01.651 --> 13:03.153
Butt-stache.

13:05.355 --> 13:07.357
It's great that you
understand this stuff.

13:07.357 --> 13:09.389
Now, we can disable
Ian's machine.

13:09.389 --> 13:10.790
No, Avery.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.262
That wouldn't
change anything.

13:12.262 --> 13:13.924
They won't leave
any of us alone

13:13.924 --> 13:16.696
as long as the puppies
and I can talk.

13:16.696 --> 13:19.199
I think I can reverse
this machine

13:19.199 --> 13:24.234
so it will turn me and the
puppies into regular dogs.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.106
Dogs who can't talk.

13:33.483 --> 13:35.685
Stan, no. No, no, no!

13:35.685 --> 13:38.088
You can't make
yourself not talk.

13:38.088 --> 13:39.549
If you're
just a regular dog,

13:39.549 --> 13:41.251
you won't be
Stan anymore.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.523
What choice do I have?

13:43.523 --> 13:45.055
It's the only thing
I can think of

13:45.055 --> 13:48.258
to make everyone leave
the family alone.

13:48.258 --> 13:51.231
Maybe being a regular dog
won't be so bad.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.433
Stan, you can't do this.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.634
You're family.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.506
What is going on in here?

13:56.506 --> 13:58.308
Ian, Stan rewired
your machine

13:58.308 --> 14:00.140
to take away
his ability to talk.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.672
Just call off this craziness
before things go too far.

14:02.672 --> 14:04.044
Ian, please!

14:05.745 --> 14:08.448
Stan, no!

14:08.448 --> 14:09.980
You have to stop him!

14:09.980 --> 14:12.082
Wait!
Stan, you can't do this!

14:12.082 --> 14:14.054
We'll find another way.
Don't do it, Stan!

14:14.054 --> 14:15.355
You have to stay you!

14:15.355 --> 14:18.058
I'll always love you kids...

14:18.058 --> 14:20.760
even if I can
never say it again.

14:22.332 --> 14:24.264
No!
No! No!!!

14:32.402 --> 14:33.703
Stan?

14:33.703 --> 14:35.475
Stan, Say something.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.776
( barks )

14:36.776 --> 14:40.380
Stan, no.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.913
Why'd you do it?

14:42.913 --> 14:45.555
You're the best friend
that I've ever had.

14:45.555 --> 14:48.318
You stupid dog!

14:48.318 --> 14:49.419
You ruined everything!

14:49.419 --> 14:51.361
Again!

14:51.361 --> 14:53.493
Ian, please,
isn't there something

14:53.493 --> 14:55.165
you can do to make
Stan talk again?

14:55.165 --> 14:57.167
No.

14:57.167 --> 14:58.999
It's over.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.431
You are useless
to me now.

15:01.431 --> 15:03.703
Your family can go.

15:11.141 --> 15:12.682
( sniffling )

15:20.320 --> 15:22.422
I love Stan so much.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.595
I would rather stay
in there forever

15:25.595 --> 15:27.227
than have
Stan do what he did.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.658
He did it for us.

15:28.658 --> 15:32.262
Shows how much Stan
loves this family.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.064
You're so brave.

15:34.064 --> 15:35.605
I'm gonna
miss him so much.

15:35.605 --> 15:37.107
Did it work, Dada?

15:37.107 --> 15:38.438
Gracie, shhhh!

15:38.438 --> 15:40.440
Not till we get out of here.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.441
( gasps )

15:41.441 --> 15:43.543
I mean...woof.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.477
It was a trick!
Get them!

15:47.477 --> 15:48.818
Run!

16:02.292 --> 16:04.494
Karl, Avery and Chloe
are hiding the puppies

16:04.494 --> 16:06.496
until we can figure out
if it's safe.

16:06.496 --> 16:07.897
Is your dad around?

16:07.897 --> 16:09.299
And why are you dressed like
our kitchen drapes?

16:09.299 --> 16:11.001
Answer the first
question first.

16:12.142 --> 16:13.543
My father's not home,

16:13.543 --> 16:15.175
And I am dressed
in my kitchen camo

16:15.175 --> 16:16.546
because I was plotting
your rescue.

16:16.546 --> 16:18.578
But I see you effected
it without my help.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.979
No worries.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.711
The face paint only takes
an hour to apply

16:21.711 --> 16:23.953
and the resulting rash only
takes a week to recover from.

16:25.355 --> 16:27.287
I'm sorry
I scared you guys

16:27.287 --> 16:29.489
by not telling you about
my plan to trick Ian,

16:29.489 --> 16:31.491
but I needed your
reactions to be real.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.393
Hey, we could've faked
our reactions.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.096
I fake my reaction to Mom's
hip-hop dance performances.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.767
You love my hip-hop dance
performances.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.470
I know, I do!

16:40.470 --> 16:42.302
We're just glad
you can still talk.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.174
We should've known
it wasn't for real

16:44.174 --> 16:45.875
when you told us
Karl was working on a machine

16:45.875 --> 16:47.337
to turn himself
into a hipster.

16:47.337 --> 16:49.179
You mean
the Hipstinator 5000.

16:49.179 --> 16:51.241
I think it's starting
to work on me.

16:51.241 --> 16:54.544
I already like a handful
of really terrible bands.

16:54.544 --> 16:57.687
Listen, what are we going to do?
We can't stay here,

16:57.687 --> 16:59.949
Karl's father
could return any time,

16:59.949 --> 17:02.322
we can't go home, they're
gonna be looking for us there,

17:02.322 --> 17:04.124
and we need some kind of plan.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.196
Guys, my secret's out.

17:06.196 --> 17:08.358
So many people know,
it'll never be a secret again.

17:08.358 --> 17:11.561
But what if we go public
so everyone knows?

17:11.561 --> 17:13.503
If I'm famous
and beloved,

17:13.503 --> 17:15.735
the government won't be
able to bother me anymore.

17:15.735 --> 17:17.237
And let's face it,

17:17.237 --> 17:19.369
how could I not be beloved
with this punim?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.814
We need some big event
that's happening live

17:24.814 --> 17:27.647
so we can get Stan
in front of TV cameras
before anyone finds him.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.350
The Hollywood Entertainment
Awards are tonight!

17:30.350 --> 17:32.952
If we go,
we can get Stan on live TV!

17:32.952 --> 17:36.256
Bennett, I need seven thousand
dollars for a dress.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.361
So Karl,
are you coming?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.333
Wouldn't miss it.
Do you think
they have these curtains?

17:43.333 --> 17:46.366
It's highly unlikely.
Then I'll stay here.

17:46.366 --> 17:50.240
So how do we get in?
Well, when we were trying
to hide Stan's secret,

17:50.240 --> 17:52.372
we needed a lot of shenanigans

17:52.372 --> 17:54.774
or a plan so crazy
it just might work.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.746
But now we're trying
to expose the secret,

17:56.746 --> 18:00.410
so maybe we need a plan
that's the opposite of crazy.

18:00.410 --> 18:02.412
Hi, I need tickets
to the awards show

18:02.412 --> 18:05.385
for five people, a dog,
and two puppies.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.459
Well, that was
surprisingly easy.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.463
They just went inside!
We need to follow!

18:13.463 --> 18:14.694
Four, please.

18:16.266 --> 18:18.428
You can't be here!
I have jurisdiction.

18:18.428 --> 18:21.231
Not anymore. You lost them--
they're fair game now.

18:21.231 --> 18:22.672
Hurry up! We need
to get in there!

18:22.672 --> 18:24.003
Cool your jets.

18:24.003 --> 18:25.475
We're trying to get
seats together.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.439
MAN: Welcome back
to the 61st annual

18:29.439 --> 18:31.641
Hollywood Entertainment
Awards.

18:31.641 --> 18:33.483
And now the nominees for

18:33.483 --> 18:36.716
Best Performance By
A Comedy Actor Playing
a Serious Role

18:36.716 --> 18:39.048
To Prove
He's A Real Actor.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.454
Okay, we just have to wait
for the right time

18:44.454 --> 18:46.596
for Stan to go
onto the stage.

18:48.298 --> 18:50.430
Or now is good.

18:51.461 --> 18:53.433
I just have
one question:

18:53.433 --> 18:56.636
what's the difference between
sound editing and sound mixing?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.808
Nobody knows, am I right?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.573
Actually, sound editing is
more placement of sound,

19:03.573 --> 19:05.014
while mixing is
more adjusting--

19:05.014 --> 19:06.376
Aaah!

19:07.747 --> 19:09.379
I guess I'll never know.

19:12.622 --> 19:14.724
( applause )

19:19.659 --> 19:23.293
Maestro, give me a little vamp
in the key of E flat

19:23.293 --> 19:24.694
and try to follow along.

19:24.694 --> 19:26.366
Come on, guys.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.167
I need back-up singers.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.340
He needs us.
We're his family.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.171
Our first shenanigan
as a family--

19:32.171 --> 19:33.573

( applause )

20:37.837 --> 20:39.669
That was amazing.

20:39.669 --> 20:41.070
How do you do that?

20:41.070 --> 20:43.112
Years of training
with some of the finest

20:43.112 --> 20:45.044
vocal coaches
in the world.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.216
What?!
No, I'm just kidding.

20:47.216 --> 20:49.419
I'm a regular singing dog.

20:50.720 --> 20:52.482
And there, my friends,

20:52.482 --> 20:55.224
is the sugaaaaar.

20:59.128 --> 21:00.660
And that's
the story of how

21:00.660 --> 21:04.594
I became
a world-famous celebrity.

21:04.594 --> 21:06.896
Becoming a celebrity meant
that I'd never have to worry

21:06.896 --> 21:08.968
about anyone experimenting
on me ever again.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.541
And the next year,

21:11.541 --> 21:14.604
I was back at the Hollywood
Entertainment Awards--
as a nominee.

21:14.604 --> 21:18.748
And the only nominee
for Best Talking Dog is...

21:18.748 --> 21:21.611
Stan,
in The Bells of Portugal.

21:25.515 --> 21:27.216
But you see,
Isabella,

21:27.216 --> 21:29.158
I'm not in love
with your sister--

21:29.158 --> 21:30.990
I'm in love with you.

21:36.726 --> 21:39.068
But through it all,
the only thing

21:39.068 --> 21:41.901
that has really mattered to me
is the one thing

21:41.901 --> 21:46.706
I've always wanted in life:
to be part of a real family.

21:49.879 --> 21:51.481
Many among the millions

21:51.481 --> 21:53.543
who now read my blog
have asked me,

21:53.543 --> 21:56.315
"What's it like
being a talking dog?"

21:56.315 --> 22:00.550
Well, in a lot of ways,
I'm just like you are.

22:00.550 --> 22:04.023
Nothing means more to me
after a long day than a hug

22:04.023 --> 22:06.055
from the people I love.

22:07.757 --> 22:10.159
We love you too, Stan.

22:10.159 --> 22:13.102
I can't imagine what our lives
would be like without you.

22:18.508 --> 22:22.842
This is Stan,
the talking dog, saying:

22:22.842 --> 22:24.574
so long.
