<i>[Dakota Laden] We will be
the first team allowed inside</i>

00:03.037 --> 00:04.003
<i>for the entire night.</i>

00:04.005 --> 00:05.704
I have
a horrible feeling about--

00:05.706 --> 00:08.007
- [bang]
- Holy [bleep]!

00:08.009 --> 00:10.175
Do not peep behind that veil
unless you're ready for it.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.443
Oh, [bleep]!

00:11.445 --> 00:13.712
Very active place,
very dark place.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.247
Thousands of people died.

00:15.249 --> 00:16.849
[Chelsea Laden]
<i>You're putting your sister</i>

00:16.851 --> 00:18.517
in the Doll Room?

00:18.519 --> 00:21.186
[JohnJohn Montelongo] <i>We did
get an EVP saying that its name</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:22.755
was The Devourer of Children.

00:22.757 --> 00:25.090
[whispers]
This is so messed up.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.725
There's no way I would ever stay

00:26.727 --> 00:27.993
in that building by myself.

00:27.995 --> 00:31.463
[whispering] Sounds there's
something in the basement with me.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.700
Was that, Chelsea?

00:34.702 --> 00:37.036
[Chelsea over radio]
<i>Please come here right now!</i>

00:37.038 --> 00:38.904
[Dakota] We're coming!

00:38.906 --> 00:41.740
<i>[Chelsea whispers] Their eyes
are piercing my soul.</i>

00:41.742 --> 00:43.575
[unearthly scream]

00:43.577 --> 00:46.078
<i>My name is Dakota Laden.</i>

00:46.080 --> 00:49.415
<i>I'm leading my sister and
two best friends on a road trip,</i>

00:49.417 --> 00:52.651
<i>exploring the most haunted
locations in America.</i>

00:52.653 --> 00:54.820
<i>[Chelsea screams] Oh, my God!</i>

00:57.023 --> 00:59.058
Oh, no!

01:00.527 --> 01:02.094
I'm freaked out.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.296
<i>[Dakota] Experimenting
with fear,</i>

01:04.298 --> 01:07.399
<i>and how it affects our
interaction with the paranormal.</i>

01:07.401 --> 01:10.335
<i>Each night,
we separate and sleep alone.</i>

01:10.937 --> 01:12.171
<i>The catch is,</i>

01:12.173 --> 01:14.773
<i>only one of us
knows where we're going.</i>

01:24.150 --> 01:26.185
[dramatic music playing]

01:40.500 --> 01:44.803
So, after travelling
for nearly 1,500 miles,

01:44.805 --> 01:47.739
we have finally made it
to the Lone Star State

01:47.741 --> 01:48.774
of Texas.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.977
<i>Chelsea, Tanner
and Alex are all resting</i>

01:51.979 --> 01:53.645
<i>in the RV right now.</i>

01:53.647 --> 01:57.316
We are on our way to one of the
most haunted towns in the U.S.,

01:57.318 --> 02:01.553
to tackle a notoriously,
menacing hospital.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.355
<i>Run by a local order of nuns,</i>

02:03.357 --> 02:05.958
<i>their resources
were stretched so thin,</i>

02:05.960 --> 02:08.227
<i>that, allegedly,
the bed linens were used</i>

02:08.229 --> 02:10.028
<i>for up to three patients</i>

02:10.030 --> 02:12.164
<i>prior to being washed.</i>

02:12.166 --> 02:14.967
Many experimental treatments
in surgeries

02:14.969 --> 02:16.702
<i>happened within the walls,</i>

02:16.704 --> 02:19.538
<i>and there were so many people
who passed away,</i>

02:19.540 --> 02:22.808
that they needed to build
a crematorium on the grounds.

02:22.810 --> 02:26.044
<i>Though the hospital has been
shut down for over 30 years,</i>

02:26.046 --> 02:27.980
locals claim that the hospital

02:27.982 --> 02:30.582
is incredibly active
with poltergeists.

02:32.952 --> 02:35.487
<i>We will be the first team</i>

02:35.489 --> 02:37.689
<i>to have completely
unrestricted access</i>

02:37.691 --> 02:39.057
<i>to explore this place</i>

02:39.059 --> 02:41.126
and whenever we're
the first team inside,

02:41.128 --> 02:43.028
it is always unpredictable.

02:46.399 --> 02:48.000
So, how is everyone feeling?

02:48.002 --> 02:50.302
Oh, I'll be honest,
I'm glad we're out of Montana.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.537
That was really, really cold.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.672
We've been driving
for a long time,

02:53.674 --> 02:56.475
but we are finally
in our destination state.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.643
Where are we, actually?

02:57.645 --> 02:59.344
We're in Texas, baby!

02:59.346 --> 03:00.712
[Alex Schroeder] Yeah, Texas!

03:00.714 --> 03:01.847
[Chelsea] Yee-haw!

03:01.849 --> 03:04.683
[all cheering]

03:04.685 --> 03:07.352
- Alex, you raised your hand.
- Where are we going for the haunted location?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.087
Alex, I can't say that.
We're gonna get to that

03:09.089 --> 03:10.722
later tonight
when we read the packet.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.024
Any other questions?

03:12.026 --> 03:14.092
I just don't trust
anything you have to say.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.761
Oh, come,
Alex, are you suspicious

03:15.763 --> 03:18.931
of my previous experiment
at the last location?

03:18.933 --> 03:20.599
Yeah, and the way you said that,

03:20.601 --> 03:22.568
makes me
even more suspicious, Dakota.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.937
- [laughs] - Well, nobody
is off the hook on this one.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.705
So, I dunno about you guys,

03:26.707 --> 03:28.574
but, after travelling
on the road for so long,

03:28.576 --> 03:30.876
I'm craving me a nice
slow cooked meal.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.044
I am starving.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.078
[Dakota] When in Texas,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.446
barbecue is king.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.682
Ooh, that sounds really good.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.550
I think we should limit
the bean intake.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.219
That's what I'm
looking forward to.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.553
We're on a road trip,

03:41.555 --> 03:42.688
we're in close quarters, like--

03:42.690 --> 03:44.056
I'm getting a lot of beans.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.357
I'm gonna get
take out beans, too.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.525
[all laughing]

03:46.527 --> 03:48.794
- [Dakota] Get some beans and barbecue!
- [all laugh]

03:48.796 --> 03:50.562
[Alex] Oh, my goodness. What?

03:50.564 --> 03:53.065
[Dakota] I guess it's the
largest rocker in the world.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.033
All right, let's get some food!

03:55.035 --> 03:56.335
[Alex] Let's do it!

03:59.439 --> 04:01.406
- Hey, hey.
- This smells great.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.875
How about we do
a couple of combo plates,

04:03.877 --> 04:06.245
with a brisket and pulled pork?

04:06.247 --> 04:09.114
Throw it on there
and whip it down.

04:09.116 --> 04:11.683
- Whoa! [laughs] - [Dakota]
That's actually pretty slick.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.253
Get outta here.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.288
- [Alex] Fancy!
- Fancy.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.290
We got a lot
of food options, you guys.

04:18.292 --> 04:21.793
- [Chelsea] It's so good.
- Oh, my God, I actually love this.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.161
[Tanner Wiseman] It's so good.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.363
[all exclaiming]

04:24.365 --> 04:26.498
[Chelsea] Oh, my God.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.634
[indistinct conversation]

04:28.636 --> 04:30.302
-[Dakota] So, you guys,
-[Tanner] What's up?

04:30.304 --> 04:32.337
- The reason why I brought us all here...
- Uh-oh.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.606
- was not just to eat
barbecue, -Here it goes.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.275
I'm gonna do something
while we're here

04:36.277 --> 04:39.044
to shake us up,
shake us to our core.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.446
- Why?
- I knew it wasn't gonna just be eating.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.948
We're gonna go ride a bull.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.783
- Wait, what?
- [all laugh]

04:44.785 --> 04:46.485
I wish you would
have told us that

04:46.487 --> 04:47.886
before we just
ate all this food.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.027
[all whooping]

04:59.532 --> 05:01.266
- Hey, you guys.
- How's it going?

05:01.268 --> 05:02.768
Are you guys ready
for some bull riding?

05:02.770 --> 05:05.037
I am very ready.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.071
All right, let's do it.

05:06.673 --> 05:08.340
Bounce right up there. Oh!

05:08.342 --> 05:10.776
You gotta try and stay on
for eight seconds.

05:11.110 --> 05:12.144
Let's go!

05:12.612 --> 05:14.046
[whooping]

05:16.382 --> 05:18.216
[all cheering]

05:18.218 --> 05:20.552
Should not have had beans.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.587
- Is it easy?
- It's pretty-- It's hard.

05:22.589 --> 05:23.689
[laughter]

05:23.691 --> 05:26.892
[indistinct chatter]

05:26.894 --> 05:28.493
[all laugh]

05:28.495 --> 05:30.529
- Dang it!
- [all continue laughing]

05:30.531 --> 05:32.064
[all cheer]

05:33.866 --> 05:35.434
There you go, Chels!

05:36.869 --> 05:38.203
[all laugh]

05:38.205 --> 05:39.471
[cheering]

05:40.239 --> 05:42.374
- You did it!
- [all cheer]

05:42.376 --> 05:44.109
Okay, Tanner,
eight seconds, and you win.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.243
You win!

05:45.245 --> 05:46.778
All right, here we go, buddy!

05:46.780 --> 05:49.081
- Hey, Chris, can we get a yee-haw?
- Sure.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.116
Yee-haw!

05:51.118 --> 05:53.051
[all cheer]

05:53.053 --> 05:54.119
Oh!

05:54.121 --> 05:55.687
Let's go, Tanner! Let's go!

05:55.689 --> 05:58.757
[cheering continues]

05:58.759 --> 06:01.426
You did it!
Oh, my God, you did it!

06:02.628 --> 06:04.262
[all cheering]

06:06.299 --> 06:07.966
[Dakota] Dude, nice job!

06:09.669 --> 06:11.002
[Tanner] Thank you!

06:13.139 --> 06:14.806
[Dakota] All right, guys,
we're here.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.609
We're pulling over in a park.
It's time.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.311
[Tanner]
This is always the worst.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.985
[sighs] All right.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.720
You guys ready
to read this packet?

06:28.722 --> 06:29.821
Let's do it.

06:33.459 --> 06:34.826
Here we go.

06:36.763 --> 06:39.364
[both] Old Nazareth Hospital?

06:43.269 --> 06:44.903
Yes. I've been told

06:44.905 --> 06:47.672
that we will be
the first team allowed inside

06:47.674 --> 06:49.741
with unrestricted access

06:49.743 --> 06:51.309
for the entire night.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.612
We all know how
these types of locations go.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.180
Usually, when we're the first,

06:55.182 --> 06:57.382
the energy
and the paranormal activity

06:57.384 --> 06:58.984
is a lot more unpredictable.

06:58.986 --> 07:00.385
[Chelsea] All right, here we go.

07:01.854 --> 07:04.456
"Cutting a commanding presence

Old Nazareth Hospital.'</i>

07:15.736 --> 07:18.170
[Phoenix Jansen] <i>When I first
walked up to the Old Nazareth,</i>

07:18.172 --> 07:22.507
I instantly felt
sadness and pain.

"Considered one of the most
haunted towns in America,

<i>in the late 19th century,</i>

07:32.219 --> 07:34.186

07:34.188 --> 07:37.456
<i>to take in
the renowned healing waters."</i>

07:38.858 --> 07:41.493
Word spread
all over the the United States

07:41.495 --> 07:44.463
that we had these magical waters

07:44.465 --> 07:46.131
that would cure anything.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.367
[Chelsea] <i>"Due to the huge
demand for access to the water,</i>

07:49.369 --> 07:53.171
<i>many bath houses,
drinking pavilions and spas</i>

07:53.173 --> 07:55.974
<i>began to pop up,
boosting the local economy,</i>

07:55.976 --> 08:00.612
and skyrocketing the town's
population overnight."

08:00.614 --> 08:04.583
There were literal tent
cities all over Mineral Wells

08:04.585 --> 08:07.152
<i>for people waiting
to get to this healing water,</i>

08:07.154 --> 08:10.222

08:12.626 --> 08:14.526
[Phoenix] <i>They heard of
something that could heal them,</i>

08:14.528 --> 08:17.262
and you gotta remember,
they were on death's door.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.897
You would just do
about anything.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.533
"But sadly, most were left

08:21.535 --> 08:24.870
tragically and fatally
disappointed.

08:24.872 --> 08:28.206
<i>Thanks to the water's
inability to cure everyone,</i>

08:28.208 --> 08:30.775
the need for a hospital
quickly arose,

08:30.777 --> 08:34.446
<i>and in 1926,
the Old Nazareth was built.</i>

08:34.448 --> 08:36.781

[Shawna Blakney]
<i>The hospital originally opened</i>

08:44.958 --> 08:47.859

08:47.861 --> 08:49.895
a janitor and a priest.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.197
<i>That's it. That was the staff,
24 hours a day.</i>

08:52.199 --> 08:54.733
So, can you imagine
how much work they had?

08:55.935 --> 08:57.469
[Tanner]
<i>"Conditions were primitive</i>

08:57.471 --> 08:59.471
<i>and unhygienic at best.</i>

08:59.473 --> 09:02.040
<i>So many people
passed away at the hospital,</i>

09:02.042 --> 09:05.877
that a crematorium had
to be built on the property

09:05.879 --> 09:07.279

09:07.281 --> 09:09.648
<i>of bodies that
were piling up."</i>

09:09.650 --> 09:13.318

thousands of people died.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.757

09:18.759 --> 09:21.660
<i>stopped admitting patients
in the 1960s,</i>

09:21.662 --> 09:24.663
<i>and remained vacant
for nearly 20 years.</i>

09:24.665 --> 09:28.133

was locked down permanently,</i>

09:28.135 --> 09:31.336

physically deserted since.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.272
But even though the hospital
had no new patients,

09:34.274 --> 09:37.175
the building
is anything but stagnant."

09:37.177 --> 09:40.211
One of the most terrifying
things that's happened to me

09:40.213 --> 09:42.981
is... I was bit.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.518
The jawline
was probably this wide,

09:46.520 --> 09:47.986
and it went up and around.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.654
It had multiple sets of teeth.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.056
Looked like a shark bite.

[Chelsea]

delivery here</i>

10:00.934 --> 10:03.702
and I saw a chair move,

10:04.804 --> 10:06.871
which I can't explain.

10:06.873 --> 10:09.808
<i>[Shawna] We've had people
choke in gas,</i>

10:09.810 --> 10:11.743
<i>we had to bring them
off the floor.</i>

10:11.745 --> 10:14.012
We had
a gentleman's pacemaker stop.

10:14.014 --> 10:16.615
<i>The minute
we got him out the door,</i>

10:16.617 --> 10:17.782
he was fine again.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.818
This stuff is intense!

10:19.820 --> 10:21.453
A lot of physical stuff here.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.854
This isn't like a door shutting,

10:22.856 --> 10:24.589
this is your body.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.691
Yeah, people
are going to hospitals,

10:26.693 --> 10:28.660
other hospitals,
functioning hospitals,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.428
because of this one.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.865
[Chelsea]
<i>"The most active areas include</i>

10:33.867 --> 10:37.302
<i>the surgery wing,
located on the fifth floor.</i>

10:37.304 --> 10:40.372
<i>Many radical
and experimental surgeries</i>

10:40.374 --> 10:43.642
<i>allegedly occurred here,
and countless patients</i>

10:43.644 --> 10:46.745
lost their lives
on the operating table."

10:46.747 --> 10:49.047
<i>[JohnJohn] My advice on
the surgical room is,</i>

10:49.049 --> 10:51.483
do not peek behind that veil
unless you're ready for it.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.218
We did get an EVP

10:53.220 --> 10:56.521
saying that its name
was The Devourer of Children.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.758
- Are you kidding me?
- Come on!

10:59.760 --> 11:02.093
Every time someone
reads something scary,

11:02.095 --> 11:03.228
your face lights up.

11:03.230 --> 11:05.730
I've been planning
and researching this

11:05.732 --> 11:07.399
for a long time,
so, I'm a little excited

11:07.401 --> 11:09.034
that you guys
are finally reading.

11:10.369 --> 11:12.837
- The doll room?
- Wait, what?

11:12.839 --> 11:15.407
- What?
- Yeah, there's a doll room.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.575
[door creaking]

11:17.577 --> 11:20.345
[Chelsea]
<i>"Located in the basement,</i>

11:20.347 --> 11:23.815
<i>this room has
the most aggressive</i>

11:23.817 --> 11:26.251
and heavy paranormal energy

11:26.253 --> 11:28.687
in the entire facility."

11:28.689 --> 11:30.221
The dolls were brought there

11:30.223 --> 11:32.724
for the children
who were suffering there,

11:32.726 --> 11:35.660
<i>so parents, family, friends,
would bring dolls.</i>

11:35.662 --> 11:37.662
<i>[Phoenix] The doll room
was actually located</i>

11:37.664 --> 11:39.864
where the old sanatorium
was located.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.566
<i>So, the sanatorium
would have housed</i>

11:41.568 --> 11:43.535
<i>the people who were
mentally disturbed,</i>

11:43.537 --> 11:46.171
people with TB, polio,
those type of diseases,

11:46.173 --> 11:48.940
also would house children.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.043
<i>[Chelsea] "Evil words have
been recorded on the Ovilus,</i>

11:52.045 --> 11:55.380
and EMS meters
would go wild in here.

11:55.382 --> 11:59.184
<i>But the most spine chilling
thing about this room</i>

11:59.186 --> 12:01.286
<i>is the physical reactions</i>

12:01.288 --> 12:03.221
<i>of those who spend
time in here."</i>

12:03.223 --> 12:06.057
We've had people had all the
way from grand mal seizures,

12:06.059 --> 12:09.260
to where they're just spaced
out and clawing at the wall.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.563
[Chelsea]
<i>"And in one extreme case,</i>

12:11.565 --> 12:14.599
<i>a young woman
had multiple seizures</i>

12:14.601 --> 12:18.470
<i>and passed out
seven times in one night,</i>

12:18.472 --> 12:21.506
though she was fine
when she left the building."

12:21.508 --> 12:23.108
You know how serious
a seizure is?

12:23.110 --> 12:24.476
It's gonna be intense,

12:24.478 --> 12:25.910
but we gotta push
the boundaries.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.112
We can't just get complacent.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.913
That's why we're here,
that's why we're doing this.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.148
[sighs]

12:30.150 --> 12:32.283
"The sixth floor
was the nuns' quarters,

12:32.285 --> 12:35.553
while the facility was run
by the Sisters of Nazareth.

12:35.555 --> 12:38.556
<i>Explorers claim
to see a ghostly blue nun</i>

12:38.558 --> 12:40.158
<i>drifting through the halls.</i>

12:40.160 --> 12:41.626
They say that their interactions

12:41.628 --> 12:43.762
with her have been nasty,

12:43.764 --> 12:45.930
and that one
cannot escape the feeling

12:45.932 --> 12:47.565
of eyes on you."

12:47.567 --> 12:48.967
When the Nazareth first opened,

12:48.969 --> 12:51.469
the nuns wore light blue habits,

12:51.471 --> 12:53.671
<i>so, often we will see</i>

12:53.673 --> 12:56.074
light blue orbs floating around,

12:56.076 --> 12:59.577
<i>but mostly we see,
they call her The Blue Nun.</i>

12:59.579 --> 13:02.514
Okay, I know like nuns are
supposed to be, like, a good thing,

13:02.516 --> 13:04.983
but the fact that one
is just roaming around

13:04.985 --> 13:07.519
in a building
is absolutely freaky.

13:07.521 --> 13:09.020
And it's blue? I'm sorry,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.989
I've never seen something blue.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.991
Yeah, right?
That might be a first for us,

13:12.993 --> 13:15.460
someone seeing
a spirit with color.

13:15.462 --> 13:20.165
<i>[Tanner] "The crematorium,
5,600 square foot facility</i>

13:20.167 --> 13:21.900
<i>adjacent to the hospital proper,</i>

13:21.902 --> 13:25.537
<i>the crematorium has never been
explored before."</i>

13:25.539 --> 13:28.406
The crematorium
is a very strange place,

13:28.408 --> 13:31.075
<i>and it's a very active place,
a very dark place.</i>

13:31.077 --> 13:32.644
<i>The reason it is so dark</i>

13:32.646 --> 13:34.112
is because this is
the last place

13:34.114 --> 13:35.213
these people ever were.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.783
<i>[Shawna] Especially the side
with the oven.</i>

13:38.785 --> 13:41.553
You just feel nauseous.

13:41.555 --> 13:44.389
All I can say is I hope
you got some fast exits.

13:44.391 --> 13:46.424
The Nazareth
is not for the faint of heart.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.159
There's no way, no way

13:48.161 --> 13:50.895
I would ever stay
in this building by myself.

13:50.897 --> 13:53.464
A lot of the people I talked
to conducting this research,

13:53.466 --> 13:55.233
they were people that were
cleaning the place out.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.702
Some of these people aren't
even paranormal enthusiasts,

13:57.704 --> 13:59.337
and they're having
these encounters.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.772
That's when you know it's scary,

14:00.774 --> 14:02.106
when things start happening

14:02.108 --> 14:03.541
when they're not looking for it.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.510
And we're going
to be looking for it.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.114
[music crescendo]

14:13.352 --> 14:15.620
[Dakota] How is everyone
feeling? You guys feeling rested?

14:15.622 --> 14:17.055
Are you ready for tonight?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.456
Not at all.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.392
I'm really nervous
for all the physical things

14:21.394 --> 14:22.493
that have happened here.

14:22.495 --> 14:24.896
Having something actually

14:24.898 --> 14:26.397
affect your physical body,

14:26.399 --> 14:28.700
that is a whole
'nother situation

14:28.702 --> 14:30.468
that I'm personally not
prepared for.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.070
I think
the biggest question for me

14:32.072 --> 14:33.538
about this whole hospital is,

14:33.540 --> 14:36.074
why is it so dark and ominous?

14:36.076 --> 14:37.809
We've been in Texas before

14:37.811 --> 14:39.477
at the Yorktown
Memorial Hospital,

14:39.479 --> 14:42.647
a very similar hospital
that was ran by nuns,

14:42.649 --> 14:44.849
and that location had a demon.

14:45.751 --> 14:47.385
[Alex] I know
you have an experiment,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.520
someone is gonna draw
the short straw

14:49.522 --> 14:51.022
but we need to be careful.
I mean, that--

14:51.024 --> 14:53.291
All this place is,
is physical attacks

14:53.293 --> 14:54.525
and seizures.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.427
Let's hope that going
to this abandoned hospital,

14:56.429 --> 14:58.162
doesn't make us go
to an actual hospital.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.232
[Dakota] All right, so,
Chelsea, Alex,

15:01.234 --> 15:02.567
you guys wanna hop up front,

15:02.569 --> 15:04.602
because we're getting close.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.804
Seven storeys of hell,
here we come.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.708
- [Dakota] Do you see it?
- [Chelsea] Yes.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.076
[Tanner]
That's got to be it, right?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.611
[Dakota] That's it, you guys.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.446
[all exclaiming]

15:15.448 --> 15:17.982
- [Tanner] What have we gotten yourselves into?
- [Chelsea whimpers]

15:17.984 --> 15:20.218
[Alex] This does not look
like a hospital.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.086
- [Dakota] All right.
- [Tanner groaning]

15:22.088 --> 15:23.855
[Dakota]
Look at this building!

15:23.857 --> 15:26.457
This is terrifying.
Look at the cross on top.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.093
[Chelsea] The broken windows.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.062
[Dakota] This is way creepier
than I imagined.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.630
[Tanner]
I'm already freaked out,

15:32.632 --> 15:33.965
and we haven't even walked in.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.167
[Dakota] All right, guys,
welcome to Nazareth.

15:40.806 --> 15:42.974
<i>So, we have set up our gear room</i>

15:42.976 --> 15:45.443
<i>right here in the main
entrance of the hospital.</i>

15:45.445 --> 15:47.745
That's about as far
as we've gone.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.113
Before we get started,

15:49.115 --> 15:51.149
- I do have...
- [Alex] Ugh!

15:51.151 --> 15:52.383
an idea.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.584
Seriously?

15:53.586 --> 15:55.353
We are going to draw

15:55.355 --> 15:57.622
and whoever's name gets drawn,

15:57.624 --> 16:00.024
they have to go spend
the next three hours

16:00.026 --> 16:01.492
by themselves,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
in the basement doll room.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.797
- What?
- What the hell?

16:05.799 --> 16:08.032
What is seriously
wrong with you?

16:08.034 --> 16:10.768
Why the doll room? The place
where people have seizures,

16:10.770 --> 16:12.971
- they vomit...
- I-- I know.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.273
You guys, I know.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.975
But that's, that's why
we're here

16:16.977 --> 16:19.377
is to do that,
is to push ourselves.

16:19.379 --> 16:21.679
- Are you crazy?
- [Dakota] Maybe.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.148
- [Chelsea] You have lost it.
- [Alex] Dude,

16:25.050 --> 16:27.518
- you are awesome.
- [Dakota] I know.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.153
<i>Instead of just one of us</i>

16:29.155 --> 16:31.189
<i>being in there alone
later when we sleep alone,</i>

16:31.191 --> 16:33.257
<i>I want someone
to start in there alone.</i>

16:33.259 --> 16:35.593
So, who wants to draw?

16:35.595 --> 16:37.095
- I will.
- Sure, I do.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.097
- What the hell was that?
- What the heck?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.199
What just happened?
You guys all wanna draw?

16:41.201 --> 16:43.134
Yeah, I would like to draw.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.670
Let's just have
the one that's left in there

16:45.672 --> 16:47.972
be the one that has to go
down there. We'll reverse it.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.108
All right, I guess everyone
just draw one,

16:50.110 --> 16:51.876
and the last person's name
in the hat,

16:51.878 --> 16:54.379
is the one who gets screwed.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.948
You guys,
this is actually terrible.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.417
- Tanner.
- Here we go!

16:59.419 --> 17:01.419
[whoops and cheers]

17:01.421 --> 17:03.554
Yeah, dude, let's go!

17:03.556 --> 17:05.089
[Chelsea laughs] Tanner!

17:05.091 --> 17:06.557
Okay, so Tanner is safe.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.359
[Chelsea whimpers] Oh, God.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.828
Are you
freaking kidding me? Dakota.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.063
[all laugh]

17:12.065 --> 17:13.364
I love this experiment!

17:13.366 --> 17:15.166
- [both laugh]
- Tanner!

17:15.168 --> 17:17.268
- We get to be safe!
- We're safe!

17:17.270 --> 17:19.103
We are safe!

17:19.105 --> 17:20.738
Oh, that sucks for you guys.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.106
Dude, it's always
me and Chelsea.

17:22.108 --> 17:23.708
Are you kidding me right now?

17:26.278 --> 17:27.311
[Chelsea whimpers]

17:28.047 --> 17:29.781
[screaming]

17:31.917 --> 17:32.917
No! No!

17:32.919 --> 17:35.086
[laughing]

17:35.088 --> 17:37.989
You're putting your sister
in the doll room?

17:37.991 --> 17:40.825
What is wrong with you, Dakota?

17:40.827 --> 17:43.194
- [Chelsea laughs]
- Yeah, I am.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.196
- Come on, out.
- [Chelsea] Oh, like, right this second?

17:45.198 --> 17:47.298
- Yeah, come on.
- [Chelsea] Okay. Sick.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.473
Oh, my gosh!

17:57.443 --> 17:59.343
[Dakota] Oh, this is freaky.

18:00.145 --> 18:01.646
Good luck. You got this.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.014
[Tanner] You got it.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.016
- Bye, Chelsea.
- Bye, you guys.

18:05.018 --> 18:05.983
[Dakota] Bye, Chels.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.553
We shut the door.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.022
I am seriously dreading

18:11.623 --> 18:13.091
spending time down here.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.358
[exhales]

18:17.663 --> 18:20.765
Please do not move.

18:21.366 --> 18:23.468
Let's just all get along.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.805
[Dakota]
So, me, Tanner and Alex,

18:27.807 --> 18:29.674
we're gonna go
to the crematorium.

18:30.476 --> 18:32.410
- [Alex] Oh, what?
- [Tanner] Wow!

18:32.412 --> 18:34.345
[Dakota] It's even got
a smoke stack.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.922
All of the paranormal claims
from the crematorium

18:44.924 --> 18:47.458
come from locals who were
trying to clean it out,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.560
and they felt like they were
being pushed out of here,

18:49.562 --> 18:51.229
forced out of here.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.798
We are the first to come in
here to explore it.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.566
So, we really don't know
what to expect.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.306
I don't like it in here.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.142
If there's someone in here,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.077
can you make some type of noise

19:06.079 --> 19:07.378
to let us know you're here?

19:17.823 --> 19:20.825
[whispers] Their eyes
are like piercing my soul.

19:21.527 --> 19:23.828
It's just so messed up.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.734
-[Dakota over radio] <i>How are we doing?
-Whoa!</i>

19:29.736 --> 19:31.569
<i>- Are we doing doing good?
- [frustrated sigh]</i>

19:33.172 --> 19:34.605
[exhales]

19:35.507 --> 19:38.242
Yep, everything is fine.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.044
<i>[Dakota] I just thought
I would let you know, Chels,</i>

19:40.046 --> 19:43.514
<i>that we're actually
in the crematorium right now,</i>

19:43.516 --> 19:46.551
<i>so, you are
the only one in the hospital.</i>

19:47.085 --> 19:48.653
Oh, my gosh.

19:48.655 --> 19:50.021
You guys didn't even tell me

19:50.023 --> 19:51.656
you were leaving the building.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.724
<i>[Dakota] Good luck, Chels.</i>

19:53.726 --> 19:56.227
<i>[Alex] Woo-hoo,
Chelsea, you got this!</i>

19:56.229 --> 19:57.461
Great.

19:57.463 --> 19:59.730
<i>[Alex] Honestly, you're
the bravest one of all of us.</i>

19:59.732 --> 20:03.000
<i>So, like, probably good
thing you're down there alone.</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:08.039
<i>[Chelsea] I have been sitting
down here for over an hour.</i>

20:09.141 --> 20:10.942
Although I'm not
getting anything,

20:10.944 --> 20:13.344
I do not feel alone.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.980
Like, I am so terrified

20:15.982 --> 20:17.682
that my ears are ringing.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.887
[controlled breathing]

20:30.195 --> 20:32.430
Time is going by

20:32.432 --> 20:34.999
so slow down here.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.669
So, what I'm gonna do is,

20:38.671 --> 20:41.973
just show you what
I am looking at right now.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.380
Just feel like I'm so on edge.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.882
[controlled breathing]

20:54.853 --> 20:57.121
[whispers] Yeah,
it's pretty creepy.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.098
So, I'm gonna roll
on the digital recorder.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.700
I'm going to set
this on the ground.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.169
We have something
that is recording right now,

21:12.171 --> 21:15.106
something that can pick up
your voice if you talk.

21:16.541 --> 21:18.409
How come you're forcing
people out of here

21:18.411 --> 21:19.810
and pushing them?

21:24.783 --> 21:27.585
Were you someone who came
to Mineral Wells, Texas,

21:27.587 --> 21:29.654
hoping that the water
would cure you?

21:36.928 --> 21:39.530
[playback] <i>Were you someone
who came to Mineral Wells, Texas,</i>

21:39.532 --> 21:41.732
<i>hoping that the water
would cure you?</i>

21:41.734 --> 21:43.768
[static noise]

21:48.273 --> 21:50.074
<i>All right, I'm gonna--</i>

21:50.076 --> 21:53.311
Nothing. We asked
a ton of questions

21:53.313 --> 21:55.046
with no results.

22:03.588 --> 22:05.056
[echo-y thud]

22:06.158 --> 22:07.525
[exhales]

22:10.429 --> 22:11.829
Hello?

22:15.300 --> 22:16.600
[Dakota over radio]
<i>Hey ya, Chelsea.</i>

22:17.536 --> 22:19.837
Jeez! Yes?

22:19.839 --> 22:22.106
[Dakota] <i>Just letting you
know, me, Alex and Tanner</i>

22:22.108 --> 22:23.908
<i>we are back in the hospital,</i>

22:23.910 --> 22:26.377
<i>and we're gonna head up
to the sixth floor.</i>

22:28.113 --> 22:29.613
All right, good to know.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.549
<i>Good luck.</i>

22:37.756 --> 22:39.290
This is the fifth floor.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.460
This was the old surgery wing

22:42.462 --> 22:44.528
where countless people
passed away.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.432
Today, people
have been scratched,

22:48.434 --> 22:49.600
they've been burned,

22:49.602 --> 22:52.069
they've felt like
something grabs their neck.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.708
[Tanner] Oh, no way!

22:58.410 --> 22:59.710
It's an operating room.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.746
[Dakota] No way, okay.

23:02.748 --> 23:04.181
Bro!

23:06.518 --> 23:07.685
Dude, it's a prosthetic.

23:07.687 --> 23:08.886
[Alex] What?

23:09.821 --> 23:11.455
Is there anybody here with us?

23:12.157 --> 23:13.858
[water dripping]

23:22.033 --> 23:23.334
I've been sitting down here

23:23.336 --> 23:25.269
for a couple hours now,

23:25.871 --> 23:27.505
and let me tell you,

23:27.507 --> 23:30.074
the uncomfortable level

23:30.076 --> 23:32.209
that I felt
when I first walked in here,

23:32.211 --> 23:34.011
I am still feeling now.

23:40.051 --> 23:42.420
- [bang]
- Holy [bleep]!

23:45.357 --> 23:47.291
[whispers] It sounds
like there's something

23:47.293 --> 23:49.126
in the basement with me.

23:51.463 --> 23:52.997
I'm going to check it out.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.174
[whispers] This place
is freaking me out.

24:06.745 --> 24:09.980
There's nothing in the hallway
that I can see.

24:09.982 --> 24:12.249
My heart is pounding.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.888
[in normal voice]
The feeling in this room

24:17.890 --> 24:21.926
just got a lot more still.

24:22.594 --> 24:25.396
Like it was almost like a wave

24:25.398 --> 24:27.631
of cold that came
into this room.

24:33.905 --> 24:35.439
I'm going to take out my phone

24:35.441 --> 24:39.143
and just take
a few pictures of the room.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.277
[camera shutter clicking]

24:46.418 --> 24:48.853
If there is something
in here with me,

24:48.855 --> 24:51.689
can you make
one of these dolls move?

25:00.499 --> 25:01.932
[exhales] All right,

25:01.934 --> 25:04.568
I'm going to look
through the photos.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.571
Nothing here.

25:09.341 --> 25:12.009
Nothing here.

25:12.011 --> 25:15.479
Those dolls are creepy, though.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.084
Okay, what...

25:21.853 --> 25:23.387
the hell?

25:23.389 --> 25:27.258
I definitely caught
something on camera.

25:27.260 --> 25:31.328
There's one photo
that has some dark shape

25:31.330 --> 25:35.165
<i>that looks like it's coming
out of the head of this doll.</i>

25:35.967 --> 25:37.968
It is not in the photo before,

25:37.970 --> 25:40.004
and it is not
in the photo after.

25:45.377 --> 25:49.046
There is nothing
surrounding this doll's head,

25:49.048 --> 25:51.315
there's nothing there.

25:54.719 --> 25:58.355
Now I am fixated on this corner.

25:58.357 --> 26:01.659
We've been told that people
have been scratched up here.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.227
Can you do something to us?

26:07.933 --> 26:10.434
Are you angry
that we're in here right now?

26:13.305 --> 26:15.039
<i>[distant scream] Oh, my God!</i>

26:15.041 --> 26:16.574
[all] What was that?

26:16.576 --> 26:18.342
Was that Chelsea?

26:18.344 --> 26:20.344
[Chelsea over radio]
<i>Get down here right now!</i>

26:20.346 --> 26:21.812
- Coming, coming, coming!
- Go, go, go, go!

26:21.814 --> 26:23.314
No, right here, right here!

26:24.249 --> 26:25.716
We're coming, Chelsea,
we're coming!

26:25.718 --> 26:27.885
- What the [bleep]?
<i>- [Chelsea] Come here now!</i>

26:27.887 --> 26:28.886
We're coming!

26:30.055 --> 26:32.289
[Chelsea]
<i>I have seen orbs before,</i>

26:32.291 --> 26:34.792
and I've seen
what looks like dust.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.795
This does not look like anything

26:37.797 --> 26:39.930
that I can make sense of.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.533
<i>I have no idea</i>

26:42.535 --> 26:45.869
what could've possibly
contaminated my photo.

26:48.640 --> 26:50.641
Oh, my gosh.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.643
I am-- [screams]

26:53.678 --> 26:55.646
What the [bleep] is happening?

26:55.648 --> 26:58.349
Dude, get down here right now!

26:58.984 --> 27:00.417
[Dakota] What is going on?

27:00.785 --> 27:01.785
Chelsea!

27:01.787 --> 27:04.188
Dude, get over here!

27:04.190 --> 27:06.290
- Yo, what, what, what?
- What happened?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.359
Okay, I don't even know
where to start.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.794
Hold on, let me just--

27:10.796 --> 27:12.363
- What is happening?
- [exhales]

27:12.365 --> 27:15.165
So, I was
just aimlessly taking photos,

27:15.167 --> 27:17.468
and I took
three photos in this area,

27:17.470 --> 27:19.169
and in the middle photo,

27:19.171 --> 27:21.839
there is a black, dark--
I will show you,

27:21.841 --> 27:23.707
coming out of that doll's head.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.809
- [Alex] Wait, what?
- I am not kidding.

27:25.811 --> 27:27.344
So, I sat down,

27:27.346 --> 27:29.913
I was just about to walkie you

27:29.915 --> 27:32.316
and these dolls
next to me fell over.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.184
- What?
- I am not kidding.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.285
The dolls fell?

27:35.287 --> 27:37.488
I don't know if it was me
that bumped the table,

27:37.490 --> 27:39.990
but it fell over.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.292
Oh, my gosh.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.561
I am-- Oh, my God!

27:54.539 --> 27:56.907
Maybe I knocked them over,
because I was so freaked out,

27:56.909 --> 27:58.575
like, maybe I moved
the table, or something,

27:58.577 --> 28:01.045
but I cannot explain that.

28:01.047 --> 28:03.080
- Look at my photo.
- Okay, let me see.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.383
From here, to here.
Do you see that?

28:06.385 --> 28:07.651
- [Dakota] Yo!
- [Tanner] What?

28:07.653 --> 28:09.186
[Dakota] There is a black mass

28:09.188 --> 28:10.888
coming out of that doll's head.

28:12.557 --> 28:14.925
- Is there anything on it?
- [Tanner] No, there's like nothing.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.027
There's nothing weird
behind it, or anything.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.696
I dunno-- There's
no explanation for that.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.531
I honestly have questions,

28:20.533 --> 28:23.701
like, I feel like we need
to know what's in here.

28:23.703 --> 28:25.335
We know that there's
something here,

28:25.337 --> 28:27.037
but what is in here?

28:27.039 --> 28:28.739
Let's whip out
the digital recorder,

28:28.741 --> 28:31.575
let's do
an EVP session in this room.

28:31.577 --> 28:33.877
I'm rolling
on the digital recorder.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.513
I'm gonna set it right here,
underneath the doll,

28:36.515 --> 28:38.415
where the photo was captured.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.853
We know that this hospital
was built with good intentions

28:42.855 --> 28:44.354
to help the town.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.924
Why now are people experiencing

28:46.926 --> 28:48.659
such terrible, dark things?

28:49.994 --> 28:51.795
Is there something evil here?

28:57.635 --> 29:00.003
Chelsea just captured
a photo of you.

29:00.005 --> 29:03.107
Can you tell us
who you are, or what you are?

29:12.283 --> 29:14.551
What is causing
all this negative energy

29:14.553 --> 29:15.652
in this building?

29:21.459 --> 29:24.128
All right, I'm gonna cut
on the digital recorder.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.162
Cutting.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.830
[playback]
<i>We know that this hospital</i>

29:26.832 --> 29:28.432
<i>was built with good intentions</i>

29:28.434 --> 29:31.001
<i>to help the town,
to help everyone.</i>

29:31.003 --> 29:33.804
<i>Why now are people
experiencing such</i>

29:33.806 --> 29:35.672
<i>terrible, dark things?</i>

29:35.674 --> 29:37.307
<i>Is there something evil here?</i>

29:38.743 --> 29:40.644
[scraping]

29:40.646 --> 29:42.713
- What?
<i>- Chelsea just captured a photo of you.</i>

29:42.715 --> 29:44.782
It sounds like not a voice,
but it sounds like

29:44.784 --> 29:47.017
the digital recorder
got like kicked.

29:47.019 --> 29:50.287
If I could just-- It sounds
like it's pissed off, like,

29:50.289 --> 29:51.722
we're calling it out.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.557
Let me play it again.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.392
<i>Is there something evil here?</i>

29:56.795 --> 29:58.729
[scraping]

29:58.731 --> 30:00.764
<i>Chelsea just captured a photo--</i>

30:00.766 --> 30:04.301
I hear, like, either a scream

30:04.303 --> 30:06.837
or almost like
the digital recorder

30:06.839 --> 30:09.006
was scraped, like moved.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.074
I can't tell, though,
like, if this is

30:11.076 --> 30:12.743
just a pissed off spirit,

30:12.745 --> 30:15.712
or actually something
much darker than that.

30:15.714 --> 30:19.082
But I'm just gonna keep playing
and see if we got anything more.

30:19.084 --> 30:22.286
<i>[playback] What is causing all
this negative energy in this building?</i>

30:31.196 --> 30:33.096
<i>I'm gonna turn off
he digital recorder.</i>

30:33.098 --> 30:34.131
[thudding]

30:34.133 --> 30:35.632
[all] What? [beep]

30:35.634 --> 30:37.434
- Hallway! Hallway! [bleep]
- Shh. Shh.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.469
[Dakota] Something
just came running at us.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.972
- [Tanner] Where's my phone?
- [Dakota] Something just came running at us.

30:41.974 --> 30:44.174
[Chelsea] Dude, what the hell?

30:44.176 --> 30:45.342
[Tanner] Hello?

30:53.818 --> 30:55.252
[playback]
<i>Cutting the digital recorder.</i>

30:55.254 --> 30:56.386
[running footsteps]

30:56.388 --> 30:57.521
[all] What?

30:57.523 --> 30:58.989
<i>Cutting the digital recorder.</i>

30:58.991 --> 31:00.023
[running footsteps]

31:00.025 --> 31:01.024
[all] What?

31:01.026 --> 31:02.359
[Chelsea] Ooh.

31:05.063 --> 31:07.731
- Okay, maybe it is time to leave.
- [Tanner exhales]

31:07.733 --> 31:09.666
I mean, we played
the whole recording back.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.969
Someone is gonna be back
here anyway.

31:11.971 --> 31:13.303
- It's true.
- So...

31:13.305 --> 31:15.205
It is that time right now.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.741
It is almost time
to separate to sleep alone,

31:17.743 --> 31:19.910
so, let's actually leave.

31:20.612 --> 31:22.145
And unfortunately, yeah,

31:22.147 --> 31:24.047
it is about that
time to go to bed.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.519
<i>[Dakota] Right now,
it is time for us</i>

31:29.521 --> 31:31.121
<i>to go to bed.</i>

31:31.123 --> 31:33.123
We believe that when you're
alone and scared,

31:33.125 --> 31:36.093
that it only amplifies
the paranormal activity.

31:36.095 --> 31:39.296
We've all agreed on the four
scariest places for us to go sleep.

31:39.298 --> 31:43.000
First, we have the nuns'
quarters, on the sixth floor.

31:43.002 --> 31:46.970
And then we have
the fifth floor surgery wing.

31:46.972 --> 31:50.474
And then we have the doll room.

31:50.476 --> 31:53.043
For our last and final
sleeping arrangement,

31:53.045 --> 31:55.445
we have the crematorium

31:55.447 --> 31:58.315
<i>behind the hospital
in its own building.</i>

31:58.317 --> 32:00.617
So, those are
our four scariest places.

32:00.619 --> 32:02.819
<i>Tanner is gonna write
those out on a piece of paper</i>

32:02.821 --> 32:05.155
<i>and then we're gonna draw,
and that's where you go to sleep</i>

32:05.157 --> 32:06.657
<i>for the rest of the night.</i>

32:06.659 --> 32:09.259
All right, Chelsea,
you wanna draw first?

32:09.261 --> 32:11.328
- All right.
- [Dakota] Chelsea is up.

32:14.499 --> 32:16.600
Are you freaking [bleep] me?

32:16.602 --> 32:18.302
- [Tanner] No way!
- [Dakota] What?

32:18.304 --> 32:20.037
- [Tanner] No way!
- [Dakota] You got the doll room?

32:20.039 --> 32:21.939
[laughs]

32:21.941 --> 32:24.608
[Chelsea] This is the worst
spot that I could've picked.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.844
[Dakota laughs]
It actually sucks.

32:27.846 --> 32:29.379
All right, Tanner's up.

32:34.519 --> 32:36.019
No!

32:36.021 --> 32:37.254
I got the crematorium.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.256
[Dakota] Oh, oh, oh!

32:39.258 --> 32:40.490
[Tanner] So, that just means

32:40.492 --> 32:42.592
that I'm in my own
separate building.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.528
Dude, actually, that sucks.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.363
[Dakota] All right, Alex,
you draw next.

32:51.569 --> 32:54.071
Ooh! I got the nuns' quarters.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.306
[Dakota] Oh, ho, ho, ho.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.941
[Alex] Honestly I feel like
I lucked out,

32:57.943 --> 33:00.310
not having the crematorium
or the doll room,

33:00.312 --> 33:03.714
but this is not gonna be
a good spot either.

33:03.716 --> 33:06.950
Well, this means
that I got the fifth floor,

33:06.952 --> 33:08.218
surgery wing.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.887
There's a lot going on
on the fifth floor.

33:10.889 --> 33:14.391
Well, guys, it's time
to bundle up and go to bed.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.227
- [Dakota exhales] - [Chelsea]
Seriously, the doll room, again?

33:17.229 --> 33:19.096
[Dakota] Yeah, again.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.564
[Chelsea] I got 99 problems,

33:20.566 --> 33:21.598
and they're all dolls.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.367
[dramatic music playing]

33:30.274 --> 33:32.809
This is really messed up.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.045
There's really
nothing normal about this.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.455
Just knowing
that I'm in a crematorium,

33:45.457 --> 33:47.624
just makes me
feel sick to my stomach.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.292
And I don't know
if it's just because

33:50.261 --> 33:52.295
I'm starting to get freaked out,

33:52.297 --> 33:55.532
or if it's just the nature
of what happened in this room.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.301
[groans]

33:58.803 --> 34:00.137
This sucks.

34:01.839 --> 34:05.308
I am up in the nuns' quarters.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.577
I didn't even
come up here at all.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.346
And the thing
that is freaking me out is,

34:09.348 --> 34:12.616
people have seen the apparition

34:12.618 --> 34:14.251
of a blue nun.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.319
If I'm speaking
to the nun right now,

34:16.321 --> 34:18.155
can you make this device go off?

34:22.994 --> 34:24.528
Show me that you're here.

34:28.699 --> 34:29.933
Are you the nun?

34:33.671 --> 34:35.272
If you're not the nun, can you--

34:35.274 --> 34:36.440
It just went off!

34:39.577 --> 34:40.844
Okay. [sniffs]

34:41.512 --> 34:43.613
So, the REM pod just went off.

34:44.849 --> 34:47.918
All right, my heart
is beating so fast right now.

34:49.520 --> 34:50.587
[exhales]

34:52.323 --> 34:54.057
I don't like this at all.

34:57.328 --> 35:00.363
Right now, I'm just kinda
walking through the rooms.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.032
They are pretty small area.

35:02.733 --> 35:04.534
Okay.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.070
That's just wrong.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.006
[exhales]

35:12.210 --> 35:13.243
[sighs]

35:14.445 --> 35:16.079
[clears throat, sniffs]

35:18.549 --> 35:20.584
[groans]

35:21.419 --> 35:23.253
I can't sleep.

35:23.255 --> 35:24.521
I feel off right now.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.189
I feel like I'm not alone.

35:26.191 --> 35:28.125
Like, I don't know where to,

35:28.127 --> 35:29.759
I just feel
like I'm being watched.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.365
Are you watching me?

35:39.203 --> 35:40.837
[sighs]

35:43.341 --> 35:45.075
[exhales]

35:46.410 --> 35:49.179
I'm just making sure
all my friends haven't moved.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.519
<i>[Tanner] Is there anybody
in here with me?</i>

35:56.821 --> 35:59.623
Can you make
some sort of noise to know

36:00.258 --> 36:01.558
that I'm not alone?

36:05.630 --> 36:08.064
- I have a horrible feeling about-- Whoa!
- [thuds]

36:09.433 --> 36:10.500
What was that?

36:12.470 --> 36:14.104
I just heard movement
behind here.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.874
I was just gonna say
I have a horrible feeling

36:17.876 --> 36:19.743
about this room.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.812
And then, also, I heard
movement behind me.

36:27.652 --> 36:28.885
Is someone here?

36:34.725 --> 36:35.692
[bang]

36:35.694 --> 36:37.427
Holy [bleep]!

36:38.796 --> 36:40.297
What was that?

36:42.333 --> 36:43.900
That was a huge bang.

36:46.904 --> 36:48.538
[exhales]

36:49.473 --> 36:50.774
[creaking]

36:50.776 --> 36:52.475
I'm in an empty room right now,

36:52.477 --> 36:56.313
and I just do not feel safe.

36:56.315 --> 36:59.216
It is one of the most
uninviting rooms I've been in.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.391
- [loud shriek]
- Holy [bleep]!

37:11.562 --> 37:13.296
What the [bleep] was that?

37:22.073 --> 37:24.307
- [loud shriek]
- Holy [bleep]!

37:27.311 --> 37:29.646
What the [bleep] was that?

37:33.618 --> 37:35.318
Dakota?

37:35.320 --> 37:37.654
- Yeah?
- [Alex] Did you just hear that?

37:38.456 --> 37:39.923
Hear what?

37:39.925 --> 37:42.626
Dude! Bro,
get up here right now.

37:42.628 --> 37:43.994
<i>[Chelsea over radio] Hey,
was that you?</i>

37:43.996 --> 37:46.563
What the-- Wait, what?
Wait, what--

37:46.565 --> 37:47.964
<i>[over radio] Alex just
heard something,</i>

37:47.966 --> 37:49.599
<i>and you just heard something?</i>

37:49.601 --> 37:52.102
I heard a loud shriek

37:52.104 --> 37:53.903
and it wasn't me.

37:53.905 --> 37:55.772
<i>[Dakota] Okay, I'm going
up to Alex.</i>

37:55.774 --> 37:57.440
Chelsea heard a screech.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.309
I just [bleep] heard a scream.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.977
- Are you serious?
- [Alex] It's--

38:00.979 --> 38:02.812
Dude, it was
right in one of these rooms.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.382
Chelsea, how did you hear it

38:05.384 --> 38:07.617
and Alex hear it, but I didn't?

38:07.619 --> 38:11.354
I don't know, but I'm really
freaked out down here,

38:11.356 --> 38:13.223
'cause that was really loud.

38:17.094 --> 38:19.095
Oh, gosh.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.097
But there's no windows open
where Chelsea is.

38:21.099 --> 38:23.233
No, and that's the thing.
If it was outside,

38:23.235 --> 38:25.902
I would've heard it, 'cause
there's open windows on my floor.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.404
I can hear the birds outside,

38:27.406 --> 38:29.306
I can hear when cars pass.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.174
Think it was like a nun?

38:31.176 --> 38:33.510
It sounded like not
like a little girl,

38:33.512 --> 38:37.180
like a woman,
like a painful scream.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.449
I mean, either a nun,
or some, maybe,

38:39.451 --> 38:41.251
like a residual sound?

38:41.253 --> 38:43.486
I'm sure this hospital
had tons of screaming

38:43.488 --> 38:44.888
and painful sounds.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.656
Dude, I don't like this at all.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.692
What is back here?

38:50.328 --> 38:51.728
Okay, creepy.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.197
That one just has a bed.

39:00.504 --> 39:01.838
I don't understand that.

39:03.708 --> 39:04.774
[Alex] What the hell?

39:04.776 --> 39:06.242
All right, man.
Well, good luck.

39:06.244 --> 39:08.778
- [Alex] Let's get this night over with.
- Seriously.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.115
[exhales] Holy [bleep], dude.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.251
[exhales, sniffs]

39:15.253 --> 39:18.555
I feel completely
just drained right now,

39:18.557 --> 39:21.057
physically, mentally.

39:21.826 --> 39:23.360
That is not what I needed.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.772
Holy [bleep]!

39:36.674 --> 39:38.108
Oh, my God!

39:39.176 --> 39:41.845
A freaking raccoon
just came up here.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.914
Holy [bleep].

39:44.916 --> 39:46.049
Hey, Alex!

39:46.684 --> 39:47.884
[Alex] Yeah?

39:47.886 --> 39:50.053
It's time to get up
and get outta here.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.355
Oh, I'm coming down.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.358
[birds chirping]

40:00.664 --> 40:02.298
<i>[Dakota] When I went
into the Old Nazareth,</i>

40:02.300 --> 40:04.901
<i>I was expecting the unexpected</i>

40:04.903 --> 40:06.369
and I still feel like

40:06.371 --> 40:08.772
we are leaving
this place totally shook.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.875
All of us felt extremely bad
for the patients there,

40:11.877 --> 40:15.211
because they felt that
there is some miracle water

40:15.213 --> 40:17.046
<i>that would cure
all their illnesses,</i>

40:17.048 --> 40:19.616
and to find out
that it was all a lie,

40:19.618 --> 40:21.151
it was heartbreaking.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.386
I mean, you can feel
the devastation

40:23.388 --> 40:24.854
<i>in that building,</i>

40:24.856 --> 40:26.790
<i>it had a darkness to it.</i>

40:26.792 --> 40:29.793
Although I only
got to see a fraction

40:29.795 --> 40:31.961
of Old Nazareth Hospital,

40:31.963 --> 40:35.532
<i>the small room that I spent
the majority of the time in</i>

40:35.534 --> 40:37.600
was terrifying.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.869
When those dolls fell over,

40:39.871 --> 40:43.106
and I caught
that odd anomaly on my camera,

40:43.108 --> 40:45.408
that was game over for me.

40:45.410 --> 40:48.645
[Dakota] <i>I do think what Chelsea
experienced in that doll room,</i>

40:48.647 --> 40:51.781
it was paranormal, it was
something trying to get her attention,

40:52.416 --> 40:54.184
and possibly scare her out.

40:54.186 --> 40:57.253
<i>One thing I found really
interesting about last night was,</i>

40:57.255 --> 41:00.356
all of our activity happened
when someone was alone.

41:00.358 --> 41:02.125
<i>[Alex] Going into this,</i>

41:02.127 --> 41:03.460
<i>we heard a lot about</i>

41:03.462 --> 41:06.229
the physical altercations here.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.198
<i>Although none of us
experienced that,</i>

41:08.200 --> 41:12.202
I feel more drained than I
have ever felt leaving a location.

41:12.204 --> 41:13.937
<i>It's like this place was sucking</i>

41:13.939 --> 41:17.373
the energy and the life from me.

41:17.375 --> 41:19.776
<i>[Dakota] I don't think
what we experienced</i>

41:19.778 --> 41:22.212
and what people will continue
to experience there

41:22.214 --> 41:23.980
is something from the hospital.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.281
<i>I don't know how it got there,</i>

41:25.283 --> 41:26.783
<i>I don't know where it came from,</i>

41:26.785 --> 41:28.551
<i>but there is something
very dark there,</i>

41:28.553 --> 41:32.222
and I have lived
to tell the tale.

41:32.224 --> 41:35.024
<i>[Tanner] So, once again,
Dakota is gonna be in control</i>

41:35.026 --> 41:36.926
<i>for our next location,</i>

41:36.928 --> 41:38.127
and anything goes with him.

41:38.129 --> 41:39.429
<i>He can change up the rules,</i>

41:39.431 --> 41:41.331
<i>he'll throw us a curve ball.</i>

41:41.333 --> 41:43.299
We're just gonna have
to be ready for it.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.869
Based off everything
we experienced last night

41:45.871 --> 41:47.103
at this hospital,

41:47.105 --> 41:49.305
it's got me very excited

41:49.307 --> 41:50.807
<i>for our next stop.</i>

41:50.809 --> 41:52.275
<i>What we experienced last night</i>

41:52.277 --> 41:53.776
<i>was more of a warm up,</i>

41:53.778 --> 41:55.111
and I can guarantee you,

41:55.113 --> 41:56.479
I will be pushing the envelope.
