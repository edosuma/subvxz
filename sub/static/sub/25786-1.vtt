00:34.867 --> 00:37.767
(door creaks open)

00:40.300 --> 00:41.833
- Listen to me, lady.

00:42.467 --> 00:43.433
(panting)

00:44.200 --> 00:46.100
You have no idea.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.000
No idea who you're fucking with.

00:49.833 --> 00:50.900
You bitch.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.567
You're gonna pay
for what you did.

00:54.633 --> 00:56.000
You hear me?!

00:56.633 --> 00:57.600
(spits tooth)

00:57.600 --> 00:58.600
Fuck...

00:58.600 --> 00:59.567
(lighter clicks)

01:08.967 --> 01:10.367
- Are you scared?

01:12.567 --> 01:14.067
Are you frightened?

01:14.800 --> 01:16.100
- Fuck you.

01:16.967 --> 01:19.267
Let me out of here.

01:19.267 --> 01:20.600
Let me out!

01:28.967 --> 01:33.967
(Dragging Chair)

01:48.067 --> 01:50.100
- Have you ever heard
of Tony Robbins?

01:52.333 --> 01:54.733
Well, if you have any
interest in human psychology

01:54.733 --> 01:57.967
whatsoever, you need to
listen to Tony Robbins.

02:00.767 --> 02:03.467
I used to think it was
bullshit to be perfectly honest

02:04.933 --> 02:07.633
then one day I came across one
of his tapes at a gas station

02:08.233 --> 02:09.833
in Missouri.

02:09.833 --> 02:13.167
This was back in the
80s when folks still
had tapes in their cars.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.900
The tape was talking
about what it is

02:17.900 --> 02:20.833
that makes people do
the things that they do.

02:22.067 --> 02:24.500
It is the root of
human psychology

02:25.833 --> 02:28.567
and it's what brought you
before me tonight.

02:34.300 --> 02:36.400
Every decision you've
ever made in your

02:36.400 --> 02:39.600
poor, pitiful little life

02:39.600 --> 02:44.433
was driven by one of two
basic human instincts.

02:45.633 --> 02:48.467
Pain and pleasure.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.367
You see, Tony says
that we as human beings

03:00.833 --> 03:03.333
do whatever it is that
we do, out of our "desire"

03:03.333 --> 03:07.967
to gain pleasure, or
our "need" to avoid pain.

03:07.967 --> 03:08.800
(Open Revolver Cylinder)

03:11.700 --> 03:14.267
You steal because you're
afraid of something.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.300
Like coming up
short on a loan or

03:17.300 --> 03:20.133
going hungry without
food on the table.

03:20.133 --> 03:25.133
Or you steal because
you like the thrill.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.767
You enjoy stealing things.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.267
(Loading bullet)

03:31.467 --> 03:33.833
You kill people because
you like killing people,

03:33.833 --> 03:36.667
or because you
were told to do so

03:36.667 --> 03:40.167
and you were too scared
to say no to the person
who gave you the order.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.733
This is an indisputable fact.

03:43.733 --> 03:44.733
(Lock Cylinder Latch)

03:46.167 --> 03:49.833
You either act out of fear,
or because you seek pleasure.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.333
It's a human thing, there
ain't no getting around it.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.333
Which brings me to my point.

03:58.133 --> 04:01.200
You, us...

04:01.200 --> 04:04.433
Right here, in this
terrible moment.

04:05.933 --> 04:08.500
Now, you say that I
don't know who you are.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.400
But that is not entirely true.

04:12.067 --> 04:16.100
Because as we have just
concluded, you can only
be one or two things.

04:17.267 --> 04:21.899
You're either a
coward or a demon.

04:23.067 --> 04:26.233
A slave or a rebel.

04:27.400 --> 04:32.333
A lion, or an itty
bitty pussycat.

04:36.433 --> 04:37.933
Am I getting through to you?

04:41.267 --> 04:43.633
- Go fuck yourself.

04:43.633 --> 04:45.633
How about that?

04:45.633 --> 04:47.900
You broke my fucking nose.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.067
- You see that?

05:01.967 --> 05:03.733
This is who you really are.

05:05.733 --> 05:09.633
Trying to convince me otherwise
is very "un-demon-like."

05:13.767 --> 05:16.567
I think I see a puddy cat.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.667
(laughs)

05:22.400 --> 05:23.833
- Fuck you!

05:24.433 --> 05:26.133
Let me go!

05:26.133 --> 05:30.267
Or I swear to God, I'm gonna
murder your fucking family!

05:31.867 --> 05:33.433
(Kicking chair)

05:37.067 --> 05:39.967
(Jimmy moaning)

05:45.167 --> 05:47.100
(Jimmy screaming)

05:50.133 --> 05:52.433
- Jimmy, my boy.

05:53.967 --> 05:58.067
This has been my
fucking pleasure.

05:58.767 --> 06:01.900
You have fucked...

06:01.900 --> 06:04.767
...with a demon queen!

06:04.767 --> 06:06.567
(gunshot)

06:08.933 --> 06:12.733
** (Western Music) *

08:01.067 --> 08:02.067
Pain.

08:04.067 --> 08:09.067
For most people, the
suffering of pain is as
intolerable as death itself.

08:10.900 --> 08:15.900
The agony associated
with physical, mental,
or even spiritual pain.

08:17.333 --> 08:20.067
is potent enough to drive sane
folks into the edge of insanity.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.367
And throw them off
the fucking cliff.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.700
(crickets chirping)

08:26.567 --> 08:29.433
Those people, are most people.

08:31.067 --> 08:35.567
And most people, seek to
spend their entire life
in search of comfort.

08:36.767 --> 08:40.299
As far away from pain
as humanly possible.

08:41.467 --> 08:45.467
But a rare few, use
pain with impunity

08:45.467 --> 08:48.867
to get those who are afraid
of it to do their bidding.

08:50.133 --> 08:53.933
For them, pain is used
as a means to an end.

08:54.833 --> 08:58.233
A tool in a madman's toolbox.

09:00.067 --> 09:03.133
As a responsible business
owner in Port City, Michigan

09:04.533 --> 09:07.300
Linda is required to make weekly
payments to the local racket

09:07.300 --> 09:09.600
in order to keep
her business afloat.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.867
Needless to say,

09:12.867 --> 09:15.933
Linda has been lagging behind
on her payments.

09:16.533 --> 09:17.400
(door bell)

09:18.700 --> 09:21.833
And when a Port City business is
behind on its payments

09:22.700 --> 09:24.900
it gets a visit, from "them."

09:25.500 --> 09:29.167
(ominous music)

09:40.733 --> 09:41.733
(gun cocking)

09:44.633 --> 09:45.933
(film burning)

09:46.533 --> 09:48.167
(gunshots)

09:52.133 --> 09:54.133
(dog growling)

09:54.133 --> 09:55.433
(dog barking)

10:06.633 --> 10:09.200
(whip cracks)

10:11.933 --> 10:13.633
(man sneezes)

10:18.633 --> 10:19.733
- Remember me?

10:25.033 --> 10:28.400
Well well well...

10:28.400 --> 10:29.667
Aren't you a peach.

10:31.533 --> 10:32.867
What's your name?

10:32.867 --> 10:34.667
- Don't talk to her.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.400
Don't look at her.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.933
(music crescendos)

10:57.300 --> 10:58.233
(lighter echos)

(swing music)

11:40.767 --> 11:42.067
(screaming)

11:42.067 --> 11:43.300
- I'm going to
give you a choice.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.600
(Linda screaming)

11:44.600 --> 11:45.800
It's not gonna be
an easy choice...

11:45.800 --> 11:46.400
(Linda screaming)

11:47.167 --> 11:48.067
But, it is a choice.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.700
which is more than
most people get

11:50.700 --> 11:51.700
when they try to back out
of a contract with me.

11:53.467 --> 11:57.067
Choice number one,
you pay me $50,000

11:58.267 --> 11:59.767
and I get the fuck
out of the way.

11:59.767 --> 12:02.567
It's an easy buyout, clean,
fair, and to the point.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.200
Choice number two

12:06.567 --> 12:09.733
You sign over ownership of
your business to me.

12:09.733 --> 12:12.600
And in return, I will
wipe the slate clean.

12:13.467 --> 12:14.867
That means you and your daughter

12:14.867 --> 12:17.133
Will get to go home alive

12:17.133 --> 12:18.933
and mostly unspoiled.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.833
That brings choice number three.

12:24.867 --> 12:26.700
I shoot you...
(cocking gun)

12:26.700 --> 12:28.500
...in the fucking mouth.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.600
(Linda whimpering)

12:31.333 --> 12:33.633
And cut my losses.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.467
So...

12:37.467 --> 12:38.300
What.

12:38.300 --> 12:39.067
Will.

12:39.067 --> 12:40.567
It.

12:40.567 --> 12:41.667
Be?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.333
Mr. Frank, this is Sam Barone.

12:57.800 --> 12:59.333
I have something for you.

- Blueberries?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.233
- Yeah.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.433
- You ever say
anything except yeah?

15:39.433 --> 15:40.300
- Yeah.

15:40.300 --> 15:42.100
(laughter)

15:48.267 --> 15:50.800
Thank you baby Jesus
for keeping us safe

15:50.800 --> 15:53.933
and giving us yummy
pancakes for breakfast.

15:53.933 --> 15:56.300
Thank you for mom
and Scarlet and

15:56.300 --> 15:58.900
Dawson and Sparkles
and Uncle Boone.

16:02.200 --> 16:05.833
And also please look after
daddy and Lily in Heaven.

16:05.833 --> 16:09.867
And make sure to tell
them how much we love them
and how much we miss them

16:10.600 --> 16:11.267
Thank You God, amen.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.333
- Amen.

16:13.333 --> 16:14.300
- [Dawson] Amen.

16:16.100 --> 16:16.933
- Let's eat.

16:17.933 --> 16:18.767
Looks good.

16:21.633 --> 16:25.867
(family chattering)

16:27.067 --> 16:28.733
- Oops, that's flopping
all over the place.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.733
- It's a flapjack

16:31.333 --> 16:32.500
It makes sense

16:33.100 --> 16:33.767
Thank you, mom.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.133

- I'm full of jokes!

- Yeah, you had two
cups of coffee already.

face, but I can tell *

whiskey-toting man *

17:42.733 --> 17:46.067
* He chases me like
the Princess Bride *

17:46.067 --> 17:49.333
* Makes me feel like
the world is mine *

17:49.333 --> 17:51.433
* But when the
lights go down... *

17:51.433 --> 17:52.467
- What is it?

17:53.533 --> 17:55.333
- [Scarlet] Something red.

18:01.633 --> 18:03.767
- Mmmm, not bad.

18:03.767 --> 18:04.967
Not bad.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.567
- Told you.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.633
Hey Dawson, cut it.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.633
- What ch'a doing?

18:15.633 --> 18:17.467
- What does it look like
I'm doing? I'm working.

18:17.467 --> 18:18.633
What do you want?

18:18.633 --> 18:19.733
- Get me a beer.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.233
(Patron laughs)

18:22.100 --> 18:23.067
- Boy you better step it.

18:23.067 --> 18:24.967
Step it, go on, get out of here.

18:24.967 --> 18:26.400
I'm gonna be telling mom.

18:34.733 --> 18:37.233
(dial tone)

18:37.233 --> 18:39.600
- [Boone] This is
Boone's voicemail, baby.

Get excited.

20:08.733 --> 20:09.133
- Here.

20:11.067 --> 20:13.200
- Hey, let me ask you something.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.667
- What table?

20:14.667 --> 20:16.400
- Oh, I think it was five.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.233
- Hey.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.967
- Always put the table
number at the bottom, okay?

20:20.967 --> 20:22.633
- Hey, what's your name?

20:23.433 --> 20:24.567
- Scarlet.

20:24.567 --> 20:25.933
- Scarlet?

20:25.933 --> 20:27.133
That's a beautiful name.

20:28.567 --> 20:29.767
I hope you don't me saying

20:29.767 --> 20:32.167

comfort, you know that?

20:33.033 --> 20:34.500
Let me buy you a drink, huh?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.333

22:06.267 --> 22:08.367
- That guy, you kicked his ass.

22:08.367 --> 22:09.667
- No, hardly.

22:10.833 --> 22:13.100
I just showed him
where the door was.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.733
You looking after your mama?

22:15.733 --> 22:16.667
- Yeah.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.433
- Your sisters?

22:20.067 --> 22:22.067
Always look after family, kid.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.633
Family always comes first.

22:26.867 --> 22:27.933

22:37.400 --> 22:38.400
Can I see it?

22:39.133 --> 22:39.967

22:50.633 --> 22:52.167
Sweet, let me hold it.

22:52.767 --> 22:54.233
- Yeah.

22:55.133 --> 22:56.600
You wanna see an ass whooping

the day I let you hold it
is the day your mama

22:58.700 --> 23:01.233

23:01.233 --> 23:02.067
I'd rather not.

23:04.167 --> 23:06.967
- Hey Dawson, go out back
and watch munchkin for a bit.

23:06.967 --> 23:08.533

23:36.133 --> 23:37.633
What?

23:37.633 --> 23:38.467
- Nothing.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.100
I talked to Doris.

23:47.067 --> 23:48.933
She's been asking about you.

23:50.800 --> 23:53.400
You know one of these days
you're gonna have to actually
say something to her.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.400
- Hey'a! Howdy folks!

23:58.400 --> 23:59.367

he plays for tips.

24:03.867 --> 24:06.900
- Yeah, and then he
drinks like a camel and I
gotta haul his ass home.

24:07.633 --> 24:09.067

Oh shit, what am I looking at?

24:16.833 --> 24:18.700

25:07.767 --> 25:09.133
All right, where you going?

25:09.133 --> 25:11.600
Nope, nope, we're going

Stay, stay.

26:40.300 --> 26:41.500

26:45.133 --> 26:46.767
I'm sorry fellas, we're closed.

26:48.467 --> 26:50.567
(walking footsteps)

26:50.567 --> 26:52.233
(suspenseful music)

26:53.133 --> 26:54.100
Excuse me.

27:08.833 --> 27:09.900
- Scotch.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.633
On the rocks.

27:13.333 --> 27:16.167
- We don't serve drinks
here after 1, it's the law.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.433
(laughs)

27:19.667 --> 27:24.567
- Do I look like a guy, who
gives a fuck!

27:25.167 --> 27:26.867
about the law?

27:28.367 --> 27:32.633
Now, get me a drink.
Before I lose my temper.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.100
- You heard him!

27:36.667 --> 27:38.400
- I'm calling the cops.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.500
- Hey!

27:39.500 --> 27:40.367
Put it down.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.433
(gun rustling)

27:41.433 --> 27:43.300
Put it down.

27:43.300 --> 27:44.133
- Okay.

27:45.667 --> 27:47.300
- That's my boy, Jimmy.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.800
He doesn't blink.

27:51.067 --> 27:53.967
And I'd hate to see you
get on his bad side.

27:55.667 --> 27:57.567
Now, I ain't gonna
ask you again.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.200
Scotch.

28:01.133 --> 28:02.100
On the rocks.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.867
Ahh!!

What's your name, Kitty Cat?

28:31.500 --> 28:32.733

28:32.733 --> 28:33.500
My name's Scarlet.

28:33.500 --> 28:35.100
- Scarlet!

28:35.100 --> 28:36.100
Sure.

28:39.533 --> 28:42.267
Well, Scarlet. You're in luck.

28:43.133 --> 28:44.900
We ain't here to hurt you.

28:46.100 --> 28:49.133
Here to have a little
chat, with the owner.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.233
Where can I find him?

28:53.667 --> 28:54.600
- [Jo] Here.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.767
(intense music)

29:09.900 --> 29:10.900
(jingling spurs)

29:12.233 --> 29:14.700
(chuckles)

29:14.700 --> 29:16.300
- Well, well.

29:17.267 --> 29:18.567
Hello, Dolly.

29:18.567 --> 29:19.567
(Jimmy laughing)

29:19.567 --> 29:20.900
- Is there a problem here?

29:23.600 --> 29:26.933
(speaking Italian)

29:30.267 --> 29:31.467
- You know who I am?

29:33.367 --> 29:34.333
- Should I?

29:38.633 --> 29:41.333
- Hey! Jimmy!

29:42.533 --> 29:44.967
Looks like we got
us a hardass here.

29:44.967 --> 29:46.233
- Seems that way.

29:48.567 --> 29:50.833
- Now you listen to me, blondie.

29:50.833 --> 29:52.933
We didn't come here to hurt you.

29:52.933 --> 29:53.767
Nah.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.333
We came here to talk
to you, that's all.

29:59.233 --> 30:01.833
But if you smart
me like that again

30:01.833 --> 30:05.333
I'm gonna have to get
real nasty with you.

30:07.733 --> 30:09.800
- What do you want?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.800
- Is that your
office back there?

30:14.033 --> 30:16.700
Now, why don't you and I

30:16.700 --> 30:19.733
go back there and have
ourselves a little chat.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.567
In private.

30:24.500 --> 30:29.300
- Whatever it is you're
selling, I ain't buying it.

30:29.300 --> 30:31.367
So I'm gonna ask you nicely.

30:32.233 --> 30:33.833
Get the fuck out of my bar.

30:37.867 --> 30:39.700
(sniggering)

30:41.967 --> 30:43.500
- You're asking me to leave?

30:44.467 --> 30:46.267
Is that what you're saying?

30:47.100 --> 30:49.967
Jimmy, look at the time.

30:49.967 --> 30:51.300
- [Jimmy] It's getting late.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.100
- I guess we better
be going, huh?

30:55.900 --> 30:58.133
(sobbing)

30:59.333 --> 31:01.067
You're gonna be
a problem for me?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.133
Huh?

31:03.333 --> 31:05.067
You're gonna give
me trouble, bitch?

31:05.067 --> 31:06.633
(intense music building)

31:07.767 --> 31:09.633
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to?

31:09.633 --> 31:12.633
Do you have the slightest
goddamn idea who
you're fucking with?

31:15.233 --> 31:18.867
Now. You and I

31:18.867 --> 31:22.867
are going back there and we're
gonna talk business.

31:24.300 --> 31:28.267
So I don't have to drag you
by your pretty blonde hair

31:28.267 --> 31:30.633
right in front of your
fucking daughter

31:30.633 --> 31:32.767
and beat you to death!

31:34.267 --> 31:36.100
You understand me?

31:36.100 --> 31:38.200
(music intensifies)

31:40.600 --> 31:41.333
- Fuck.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.767
Momo, Momo!

(Spaghetti Western music)

31:56.900 --> 31:58.567
(gunshot)

32:04.467 --> 32:05.567
- Drop it.

32:06.933 --> 32:07.767
Get up.

32:13.567 --> 32:14.933
I'm gonna kick you now.

32:17.867 --> 32:19.533
(Jimmy panting)

32:22.367 --> 32:25.067
(Western music resumes)

32:37.967 --> 32:38.967
(stomping feet)

32:38.967 --> 32:40.533
- Fuck you!

32:40.533 --> 32:41.533
Fuck!

32:42.467 --> 32:43.467
Fuck you!

32:44.933 --> 32:46.733
Motherfucker, fuck you!

32:46.733 --> 32:48.067
Agh! Fuck you!

32:48.600 --> 32:49.167
- Wake up.

32:49.167 --> 32:49.767
- Momo.

32:49.767 --> 32:50.867
- Die!

32:51.500 --> 32:52.333
What the fuck?

32:52.333 --> 32:53.167
(inaudible screaming)

32:53.167 --> 32:54.300
(Momo grunting)

32:54.300 --> 32:55.733
- I don't feel so good.

32:57.167 --> 32:58.267
How do I look?

32:58.900 --> 33:00.100
Do I look okay?

33:00.100 --> 33:01.800
(crickets chirping)

33:02.833 --> 33:04.067
Listen to me.

33:04.067 --> 33:05.067
Wake up!

33:10.433 --> 33:11.833
- [Jimmy] Momo.

33:15.333 --> 33:17.200
(Jimmy panting heavily)

33:29.167 --> 33:31.067
(loading clip)

33:34.333 --> 33:35.400
- Who are you?

33:38.233 --> 33:39.733
What are you doing here?

33:40.900 --> 33:43.267
- You're in trouble now.

33:43.267 --> 33:45.600
You silly fucking hillbilly.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.100
(gunshot)

33:49.100 --> 33:50.700
(screaming)

33:50.700 --> 33:52.600
Fuck!

33:52.600 --> 33:54.333
(Jimmy crying)

33:54.800 --> 33:55.767
Fuck!

33:55.767 --> 33:56.800
- Answer the question please.

33:59.567 --> 34:01.267
- You can't shoot me.

34:01.267 --> 34:02.200
- I can't?

34:02.200 --> 34:03.900
- You can't fucking shoot me!

34:03.900 --> 34:05.300
- Think I just did.

34:05.300 --> 34:06.433
- You know who I am? Huh?

34:06.433 --> 34:07.367
- [Boone] No.

34:07.367 --> 34:09.667
- Do you have any fucking idea?

34:09.667 --> 34:12.132
Do you?
- Why don't you tell me.

34:13.367 --> 34:15.632
- My name is Jimmy Marcone

34:15.632 --> 34:16.699
Asshole!

34:17.433 --> 34:18.667
- Never heard of you.

34:18.667 --> 34:19.333
- Google it, fuck
you, Google it!

34:19.333 --> 34:21.266
- Fuck you.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.266
- I have a fucking
Crimepedia page about
me, who the fuck are you?

34:25.632 --> 34:26.400
No no no no!

34:26.400 --> 34:27.333
(gunshot)

34:27.333 --> 34:29.233
Ah! Fuck! goddammit!

34:29.233 --> 34:32.266
Stop it! Stop it! Stop fucking
shooting me, man!

34:32.266 --> 34:33.300
- Stop lying to me.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.433
- I ain't fucking lying!

34:35.433 --> 34:36.433
(deep base rumble)

34:39.067 --> 34:41.333
- I'm gonna have to put
another hole in you.

34:42.367 --> 34:44.733
- I ain't lying.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.567
(creeking wood)

35:18.700 --> 35:20.467
- What you gonna do with him?

35:20.467 --> 35:21.700
- We can't let him go.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.767
You know what will
happen if we do.

35:26.700 --> 35:28.867
- [Jimmy] Hello!

35:28.867 --> 35:30.600
Hello!

35:30.600 --> 35:33.467
I need to get to a hospital!

35:33.467 --> 35:35.400
I'm bleeding to death over here!

35:35.400 --> 35:36.600
Come on!

35:37.967 --> 35:39.900
- Damned if you do.

35:46.267 --> 35:48.133
- Damned if I don't.

35:49.300 --> 35:52.300
(Footsteps)

35:55.267 --> 35:56.467
(Zippo lighter opens)

35:57.200 --> 36:01.300
(dramatic western music)

36:10.800 --> 36:12.767
- Listen to me, lady.

36:14.433 --> 36:16.533
You have no idea.

36:16.533 --> 36:19.133
No idea who you're fucking with.

36:44.133 --> 36:47.967
(Western music intensifies)

37:25.300 --> 37:27.067
(sobbing)

37:47.433 --> 37:48.800
(keys clanging)

37:56.333 --> 38:01.333
- I say we tie these monkeys
up, bag 'em, seal 'em, I'll
drive them down the river.

38:03.133 --> 38:06.467
You stay here and take care of
the rest of this mess, yeah?

38:08.367 --> 38:11.967
(ominous atmosphere music)

38:18.233 --> 38:20.200
(engine revs)

38:31.333 --> 38:34.133
(river burbles)

38:42.067 --> 38:43.167
(lighter clicks)

38:46.667 --> 38:49.500
(thunder rumbles)

38:49.500 --> 38:51.567
(tense music building)

39:10.267 --> 39:13.333
(insects chirping)

39:32.433 --> 39:37.133
- To my bright
and talented star.

39:37.133 --> 39:40.333
May you keep shining forever.

39:43.067 --> 39:44.767
Love, dad.

39:50.167 --> 39:51.700
It's getting late.

39:51.700 --> 39:56.700
You get some sleep.

39:57.467 --> 39:58.733
Goodnight.

40:07.933 --> 40:09.133
- I saw you.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.167
In the monitor.

40:14.333 --> 40:15.333
- What?

40:16.867 --> 40:18.500
- I saw what you
did to that guy.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.367
- Momo.

40:20.567 --> 40:22.967
(gunshot)

40:24.100 --> 40:26.233
- [Dawson] They were
bad guys, right?

40:29.200 --> 40:30.267
- Yes.

40:31.700 --> 40:32.900
Yes, they were.

40:46.933 --> 40:51.900
(rain falls)
(thunder rumbles)

41:26.333 --> 41:29.900
(phone ringing)

41:40.567 --> 41:41.967
- Hello?

41:44.833 --> 41:46.967
Oh, it's you.

41:52.067 --> 41:53.267
June bug.

41:57.967 --> 42:00.067
How you been, sis?

42:03.800 --> 42:06.967
We've missed you, you know that?

42:09.067 --> 42:11.733
The girls have been
asking about you.

42:11.733 --> 42:13.400
May's been talking about you.

42:19.767 --> 42:20.900
How's Boone?

42:28.767 --> 42:30.067
Come home.

42:38.967 --> 42:40.400
(water rushing)

42:47.633 --> 42:49.700
(dramatic music)

42:56.067 --> 43:00.100
(thunder booming)

43:14.533 --> 43:16.667
(thunder rumble)

43:17.400 --> 43:19.767
- [Lily] Um, okay.

43:20.500 --> 43:22.667
The Brady Bunch.

43:22.667 --> 43:23.633
- [Jo] Uh-uh.

43:23.633 --> 43:25.067
- What?
- [Jo] No.

43:25.067 --> 43:26.467
- What?

43:26.467 --> 43:29.067
- [Jo] "The" Brady Bunch?
That's a 'T' baby, not a 'B'.

43:30.167 --> 43:31.167
Now, go on, try again,
what you gotta pick?

43:31.167 --> 43:32.100
- A 'B.'

43:32.100 --> 43:33.333
- [Jo] That's right, go on.

43:33.333 --> 43:35.533
- B, um...

43:36.267 --> 43:37.600
Beavis and Butthead.

43:37.600 --> 43:40.433
(laughter)
(Jo laughing)

43:40.433 --> 43:43.533
- [Jo] How do you?
Do you know what that is?

43:43.533 --> 43:46.333
- [Marvin] What she say?

43:46.333 --> 43:48.800
- Beavis and Butthead.

43:48.800 --> 43:49.900
(laughter)

43:49.900 --> 43:52.267
(thunder, dramatic music)

43:54.833 --> 43:58.067
(brakes screeching)

43:58.067 --> 43:59.733
(dramatic music)

43:59.733 --> 44:02.067
Baby, baby are you okay?
Are you hurt?

44:02.067 --> 44:05.067
Baby, baby, do you remember that
game that we play

44:05.067 --> 44:06.767
when the wind gets
angry outside?

44:07.367 --> 44:08.167
- Take it.

44:08.167 --> 44:09.633
- What are you doing?

44:09.633 --> 44:10.733
- Take it.

44:10.733 --> 44:11.733
(music intensifying)

44:17.833 --> 44:19.833
(door slammed)

44:19.833 --> 44:21.200
- You remember that
game, you wanna play that
game with me right now?

44:21.200 --> 44:22.667
Yeah, the tornado game?

44:22.667 --> 44:25.500
Okay, I need you to put your
hands over your ears

44:25.500 --> 44:27.467
and I want you to
close your eyes.

44:27.467 --> 44:30.133
Can you do that for mommy, can
you do that for mommy right now?

44:30.133 --> 44:32.867
Yeah, good girl, good girl.

44:32.867 --> 44:36.800
(Lily humming)

44:36.800 --> 44:38.167
- [Jo] May!

44:38.167 --> 44:39.333
May!

44:41.500 --> 44:42.233
(gunshot)

44:42.233 --> 44:43.600
- [Lily] Daddy!

44:43.600 --> 44:44.667
No!

44:46.133 --> 44:47.300
(laughing)

44:47.900 --> 44:48.667
- No!

44:49.267 --> 44:51.500
(gunshot)

44:52.800 --> 44:53.833
- No, no!

44:53.833 --> 44:55.267
- [Lily] Mommy!
- Don't!

44:55.267 --> 44:57.400
- Lily, Lily, no, no!
- [Lily} Mom!

44:57.400 --> 44:58.767
- No! Get off!

44:59.233 --> 45:00.633
Get off!

45:00.633 --> 45:01.733
No!

45:04.067 --> 45:04.867
(rifle cock)

45:04.867 --> 45:06.600
(gunshot)

45:06.600 --> 45:09.433
(thunder rumbling)

45:20.667 --> 45:23.167
- [Jo] No, no, no no, no.

45:23.767 --> 45:27.300
(Jo sobbing)

45:45.400 --> 45:48.767
(crying)

46:01.933 --> 46:03.067
No!

46:05.667 --> 46:07.067
(rainfall stops abruptly)

46:07.733 --> 46:10.767
(dramatic music)

46:10.767 --> 46:11.633
(lighter click)

46:11.633 --> 46:13.267
- You motherfucker.

46:13.267 --> 46:15.133
(chuckles)

46:17.900 --> 46:18.900
(snifs)

46:18.900 --> 46:19.900
(Zippo clicking)

46:19.900 --> 46:20.900
(dramatic music continues)

46:24.633 --> 46:27.167
(fuse sizzle)

46:27.167 --> 46:29.400
(exploding boom)

46:29.400 --> 46:30.533
(noir jazz music)

46:31.700 --> 46:34.367
I hear we own a new
bar up on Carson Road.

46:34.367 --> 46:35.700
- [Sam] Sure do.

46:35.700 --> 46:37.300
- What happened?

46:37.300 --> 46:38.567
- [Sam] She wanted out.

46:38.567 --> 46:39.933
(chuckles)

46:39.933 --> 46:41.400
- Did you call Mr. Frank?

46:42.133 --> 46:43.100
- [Sam] I sure did.

46:43.100 --> 46:44.900
- Ahhh... good.

46:44.900 --> 46:46.600
You did really good, Sammy.

46:47.767 --> 46:51.500
I hear about that
Gary Sims fella too.

46:52.600 --> 46:54.067
(chuckles)

46:54.067 --> 46:55.767
Blew his fucking brains out.

46:56.867 --> 46:58.967
It's amazing ain't it?

46:58.967 --> 47:01.533
All we gotta do is knock
on the door and they blast
themselves out of the way.

47:02.133 --> 47:04.733
(laughter)

47:07.067 --> 47:09.467
What the fuck are
you laughing at?

47:09.467 --> 47:10.800
- Nothing boss, sorry.

47:12.267 --> 47:13.833
- How's the wife?

47:13.833 --> 47:15.567
- She's good.

47:15.567 --> 47:18.600
- That's a rhetorical question
fuck'o, I don't give a shit.

47:18.600 --> 47:22.167
(laughter)

47:22.633 --> 47:23.733
Okay

47:25.400 --> 47:27.567
Enough fucking around,
let's cut straight to
the chase here fellas.

47:28.333 --> 47:29.800
Time's a-wastin'.

47:32.367 --> 47:33.733
I got a job for you.

47:35.067 --> 47:36.167
It's a bar.

47:37.067 --> 47:40.733
A small, family owned joint.

47:40.733 --> 47:43.600
At least, I think
it's family owned.

47:43.600 --> 47:46.467
Who the hell knows with
a name like...

47:46.467 --> 47:47.833
"Pickings"

47:47.833 --> 47:49.867
(chuckles)

47:49.867 --> 47:53.933
I sent Momo and Jimmy down
there, to shake them down.

47:53.933 --> 47:58.600
Show them how we do things
around our nec k of the woods.

48:06.333 --> 48:07.400
They're gone.

48:09.600 --> 48:10.833
- Who's gone?

48:11.700 --> 48:12.967
- Momo and Jimmy.

48:13.900 --> 48:15.467
Gone.

48:15.467 --> 48:16.833
- Gone how?

48:19.100 --> 48:22.233
- What are you, a
fucking wiseguy, huh?

48:22.233 --> 48:23.633
What do you mean "how"?

48:24.767 --> 48:27.967
They're gone,
missing, disappeared.

48:27.967 --> 48:30.100
They're not answering
their phones.

48:30.100 --> 48:32.767
Their wives keep calling me
up asking me where they are.

48:32.767 --> 48:34.500
I got jobs piling up.

48:34.500 --> 48:37.367
The phone's ringing
off the fucking hook.

48:37.367 --> 48:41.100
They're gone, vanished, vapored!

48:41.100 --> 48:43.267
Should I paint you a picture?

48:44.500 --> 48:45.633
- [Sam] Holy shit.

48:46.567 --> 48:48.067
- Yeah.

48:48.067 --> 48:49.300
You can say that again.

48:50.967 --> 48:53.467
But, hey...

48:53.467 --> 48:55.100
anything could've
happened to them.

48:56.433 --> 48:59.333
They could've been
snatched up by some cops,

48:59.333 --> 49:03.133
or abducted by aliens for
all we know, yo - shit happens.

49:04.067 --> 49:05.867
- What if it's another family?

49:05.867 --> 49:06.767
- Family?

49:06.767 --> 49:07.933
(laughs)

49:07.933 --> 49:08.933
Family...

49:10.100 --> 49:11.967
What fucking family
is going to come here?

49:13.133 --> 49:14.600
We're in the middle
of buttfuck, nowhere.

49:14.600 --> 49:18.167
Halfway across the country
from any city worth working in.

49:18.167 --> 49:20.267
This is Port-Fucking-City.

49:20.267 --> 49:21.433
I say we...

49:22.400 --> 49:24.100
(chocolate balls rustling)

49:26.533 --> 49:27.733
(loud chewing)

49:31.500 --> 49:34.133
What the fuck are you doing?

49:40.300 --> 49:43.167
Do you know why I put
these balls up here?

49:43.167 --> 49:44.400
Huh?

49:44.400 --> 49:45.633
Do you know why
I put these here?

49:45.633 --> 49:47.800
You don't know why I
put these here right?

49:47.800 --> 49:51.833
You don't have any... don't
you touch my fucking balls!

49:51.833 --> 49:53.400
They're my balls!

49:53.400 --> 49:55.633
You keep your
hands off my balls!

49:55.633 --> 49:57.300
You understand me?

49:57.300 --> 49:59.500
You cocksucker, come over here!

50:00.233 --> 50:01.633
Come here, right now!

50:01.633 --> 50:02.833
Stand right here!

50:02.833 --> 50:03.767
- Leo--

50:03.767 --> 50:05.833
- Don't you fucking "Leo" me!

50:05.833 --> 50:07.767
Come here and get
what's coming to you,

50:07.767 --> 50:09.733
or keep standing
there like a snail

50:09.733 --> 50:12.233
and I'm gonna put one right
between your fucking teeth.

50:12.233 --> 50:15.000
I ain't gonna say
it again, asshole!

50:15.000 --> 50:16.167
One!

50:16.167 --> 50:17.167
Two!

50:18.967 --> 50:21.333
Closer, step closer.

50:22.867 --> 50:24.733
Right here, you see
where I'm pointing?

50:24.733 --> 50:28.600
This spot, step, step
closer, closer, come on,

50:28.600 --> 50:31.433
come on, closer. You see
where I'm pointing?

50:31.433 --> 50:33.367
Don't let me asking you again!

50:33.367 --> 50:36.567
Closer! Right here!
Right on this spot!
Right where I'm pointing!

50:37.733 --> 50:38.867
(body falls)

50:38.867 --> 50:40.533
You son of a bitch!

50:40.533 --> 50:43.033
(Tommy sobbing)

50:46.833 --> 50:49.067
Stop it, stop crying.

50:49.067 --> 50:51.900
Go over there, over
there, near the pole.

50:53.500 --> 50:56.233
What are you limping
for, you fucking moron?
I hit you in the face!

50:58.133 --> 51:00.467
Turn around, turn around,
face the pole, I don't
wanna look at you.

51:00.467 --> 51:02.233
(crying)

51:02.233 --> 51:03.467
Fucking clown.

51:04.067 --> 51:06.467
(sobbing)

51:08.633 --> 51:10.167
(muffled Noir music resumes)

51:10.767 --> 51:12.733
Sammy boy

51:14.067 --> 51:16.833
I'm gonna need you to take care
of this problem for me.

51:18.467 --> 51:21.933
I want you to go down
there and see what you
can find out for me.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.333
Do a little snooping around.

51:25.500 --> 51:27.500
I wanna know who
these people are,

51:27.500 --> 51:29.767
I wanna know who
they're working for

51:29.767 --> 51:33.800
and I wanna know, where the
fuck are my goddamn boys.

51:34.967 --> 51:39.233
But most importantly,
I want that bar, Sammy.

51:39.233 --> 51:40.267
Understood?

51:41.433 --> 51:42.933
(music crescendos)

51:51.167 --> 51:53.200
(birds chirping)

51:58.067 --> 52:00.067
- Good morning.

52:00.067 --> 52:01.467
- Good morning.

52:03.633 --> 52:05.400
How'd you sleep?

52:05.400 --> 52:06.400
- Okay.

52:07.467 --> 52:08.567
- Just okay?

52:09.433 --> 52:11.467
- Yeah, Sparkles snores a lot.

52:12.833 --> 52:14.733
- He does doesn't he?

52:15.667 --> 52:17.467
You know who else snores a lot?

52:18.100 --> 52:19.067
You.

52:19.067 --> 52:20.267
- I don't snore!

52:20.267 --> 52:22.800
- Yes you do, you sound
like a little piggy.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.167
like...
(oinking)

52:24.167 --> 52:25.967
- No, that's Sparkles.

52:25.967 --> 52:28.667
(laughter)

52:28.667 --> 52:32.900
- [Family] Happy
birthday to you!

52:34.133 --> 52:36.367
(cheering, laughing)

52:36.367 --> 52:38.567
- Happy birthday, Scarlet.
- Thank you! Thanks!

52:39.300 --> 52:40.567
- Grab some of this.

52:40.567 --> 52:42.333
- Emma, go give this
to your uncle Boone.

52:42.333 --> 52:44.100
Don't take no for an answer.

52:46.667 --> 52:49.067
- Uncle Boone, this is for you.
Put it on.

52:49.067 --> 52:51.333
- Ugh, no thanks
munchkin, I'm good.

52:51.333 --> 52:53.300
- [Emma] Please, Uncle Boonie?

53:00.333 --> 53:02.900
(laughter)

53:04.400 --> 53:06.067
- That's beautiful.

53:06.067 --> 53:07.300
- Fashion!

53:07.300 --> 53:08.067
Good job, Emma.

53:08.067 --> 53:09.600
Okay, presents?

53:09.600 --> 53:11.467
- It's present time, it's
the best time of the year.

53:11.467 --> 53:12.767
(laughter)

53:12.767 --> 53:14.400
What is this?

53:14.400 --> 53:15.700
Can I do it now, can
I open them? - Yes

53:15.700 --> 53:16.967
- You sure?
- Yes

53:18.067 --> 53:20.867
- Oh my good... Emma!

53:21.600 --> 53:23.733
These are beautiful.

53:23.733 --> 53:26.800
Thank you so much, oh my gosh.

53:27.267 --> 53:28.100
Me too

53:31.167 --> 53:32.133
Yay.

53:32.733 --> 53:34.067
Oh look at that.

53:35.100 --> 53:36.500
Oh, I love it!

53:36.500 --> 53:39.667
- Alright, thank you, really,
thank you so much, Em.

53:40.733 --> 53:43.767
- I have a big surprise
for you as well.

53:43.767 --> 53:48.767
It's at the bar, under my desk,
in a pretty little box.

53:49.633 --> 53:53.800
(acoustic guitar strumming)

54:16.067 --> 54:18.167
* Trouble is

54:18.167 --> 54:23.167
* Got trouble on my mind

54:25.233 --> 54:27.600
* Trouble is

54:27.600 --> 54:32.600
* Growing up takes time

54:34.467 --> 54:39.467
* On and on, doing
the best I can *

54:43.367 --> 54:48.367
* Road so long,
try to understand *

54:52.133 --> 54:57.133
* Gets colder and darker
the older you get *

55:01.667 --> 55:06.667
* The day's getting longer
before the sun sets.... *

55:08.300 --> 55:11.133
* And I ain't done
with this one yet *

55:11.133 --> 55:15.633
* Follow my shadow
wherever it goes *

55:15.633 --> 55:20.433
* Walking in circles,
I step on my own soul *

55:20.433 --> 55:25.433
* Where we're all
going, nobody knows *

55:29.333 --> 55:33.333
* Left or right, I
still got fight *

55:33.333 --> 55:38.333
* You know how it goes -
'Out of mind, out of sight' *

55:42.067 --> 55:46.867
* And I ain't dying
here tonight *

55:46.867 --> 55:51.067
* I ain't dying here tonight

55:51.067 --> 55:55.533
* Still got time to
make things right *

55:55.533 --> 56:00.567
* Still got time, it's alright

56:05.133 --> 56:08.733
(applause, cheering)

56:15.633 --> 56:18.467
- Scarlet, I want
you to have this.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.233
- No.

56:22.067 --> 56:23.233
- Scarlet.

56:23.233 --> 56:25.533
- Mom, I don't want
it, put it away please.

56:25.533 --> 56:27.600
- This can save more than
just your life, okay?

56:27.600 --> 56:30.233
You need to take it, and you
need to keep it with you.

56:30.233 --> 56:33.167
- I don't want anything to do
with that, I'm not taking it.

56:33.167 --> 56:35.667
- Do you understand the
situation that we're in?

56:36.867 --> 56:37.967
Do you?

56:40.767 --> 56:41.967
Take it.

56:41.967 --> 56:43.433
- No.

56:43.433 --> 56:44.900
I'm not like you, mom.

56:46.100 --> 56:48.167
And I don't wanna
be like you, okay?

56:48.167 --> 56:51.167
I'm not a violent person,
that's not in me, that's
not a part of who I am.

56:53.133 --> 56:54.600
If that's you, that's
your business, but that
is not a part of my story,

56:54.600 --> 56:56.467
don't give me a fucking gun
for my fucking birthday!

56:56.467 --> 56:57.933
- You hold your tongue.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.067
I am gonna say
this one more time.

57:03.833 --> 57:04.767
You take it.

57:04.767 --> 57:05.933
- No.

57:05.933 --> 57:06.767
- Scarlet.

57:06.767 --> 57:08.300
- Mom!

57:08.300 --> 57:11.300
I'm not taking it, why is that
so hard for you to understand?

57:12.900 --> 57:15.367
You weren't around for
the consequences of
your actions, I was.

57:16.467 --> 57:18.067
You didn't see the
other side of it, I did.

57:19.233 --> 57:21.633
You didn't have to go
to dad's funeral, okay?

57:22.100 --> 57:23.100
I did.

57:24.400 --> 57:25.367
You didn't have to
identify Lily's dead body--

57:25.367 --> 57:26.200
- Scarlet, that is enough!

57:26.200 --> 57:27.067
- I did!

57:27.067 --> 57:28.300
- That is enough!

57:28.300 --> 57:30.767
- You didn't have
to explain to Emma

57:30.767 --> 57:33.800
why her mommy was
in a fucking coma!

57:33.800 --> 57:34.833
Guess what, I did!

57:34.833 --> 57:36.500
- Scarlet, that is enough!

57:36.500 --> 57:37.733
Thank you!

57:38.833 --> 57:41.100
Happy birthday, Scarlet.

57:59.133 --> 58:00.200
(sniffling)

58:00.800 --> 58:01.467
- Seriously.

58:01.467 --> 58:02.900
(footsteps)

58:02.900 --> 58:04.567
Seriously!

58:07.567 --> 58:11.167
(ominous atmosphere music)

58:19.333 --> 58:20.867
(Zippo clicks)

58:20.867 --> 58:25.133
* There ain't no grave,
can hold my body down *

58:26.633 --> 58:31.600
* Ain't no grave can
hold my body down *

58:33.067 --> 58:34.733
- You mind if I join you?

58:35.900 --> 58:37.533
* When I hear that trumpet...

58:38.133 --> 58:38.933
- By all means.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.167
* gonna rise right
out of the ground*

58:42.167 --> 58:45.967
* Ain't no grave, can
hold my body down *

58:46.567 --> 58:48.067
(coughing)

58:51.833 --> 58:53.133
- Holy shit.

58:55.700 --> 58:56.833
What's in that?

58:58.067 --> 59:00.267
- I call it...

59:00.267 --> 59:01.733
"Adios, Motherfucker."

59:01.733 --> 59:04.500
(laughs)

59:09.600 --> 59:13.433
* There ain't no grave,
can hold my body down *

59:13.433 --> 59:14.433
[Jo] Oh, boy

59:14.433 --> 59:15.433
(music intensifies)

59:18.900 --> 59:21.667
* Well, look down
yonder Gabriel *

59:21.667 --> 59:24.767
* Put your feet on
the land and see *

59:24.767 --> 59:27.567
* But Gabriel don't
you blow your trumpet *

59:27.567 --> 59:29.967
* Until you hear from me.

59:29.967 --> 59:30.967
(sniffle)

59:31.900 --> 59:33.900
- I'll talk to Scarlet if you...

59:33.900 --> 59:34.700
Ahh...

59:34.700 --> 59:35.700
(Boone clears throat)

59:36.867 --> 59:38.900
I'll talk to Scarlet
if you want me to.

59:40.067 --> 59:42.067
I don't know what
much good it'll do.

59:42.067 --> 59:43.067
(Jo coughing)

59:45.700 --> 59:48.867
Her whole life her mother
taught her nonviolence

59:49.633 --> 59:51.067
No guns.

59:52.433 --> 59:54.667
Then all of a sudden
one day you come in,

59:54.667 --> 59:56.133
let me guess, you
just rolled up on her,

59:56.133 --> 59:59.067
You said, "here, Scarlet"
you take this gun now.

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:03.400
You take this gun, you
just might have to shoot
someone in their faces.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:04.467
- No, no no no.

01:00:04.467 --> 01:00:05.400
- Bang bang, Scarlet.

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:06.067
- Okay!

01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:06.900
Bang bang.

01:00:07.633 --> 01:00:08.667
- [Jo] She... fucking...

01:00:09.267 --> 01:00:10.367
She hates me.

01:00:10.367 --> 01:00:11.900
No, you should've seen her.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.700
- [Boone] She doesn't hate you.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:14.567
- [Jo] She hates me.

01:00:24.233 --> 01:00:26.900
- [Boone] Let me guess,
you just rolled up on her.

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:30.100
You said hey Scarlet,
here's a gun.

01:00:31.567 --> 01:00:34.233
You just might have to shoot
some people in their faces.

01:00:35.567 --> 01:00:37.633
(laughs)

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.033
You are so dumb.

01:00:40.033 --> 01:00:41.867
- [Jo] You are so fucking...

01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:42.933
(laughter)

01:00:42.933 --> 01:00:45.033
(insects chirping)

01:00:57.433 --> 01:00:59.467
- Excuse me.

01:00:59.467 --> 01:01:00.900
Can I bother you for a light?

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.400
- Um...

01:01:06.133 --> 01:01:07.300
Yeah, sure.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.967
(suspenseful music)

01:01:17.133 --> 01:01:18.133
(lighter sparks)

01:01:28.167 --> 01:01:29.267
- Thank you.

01:01:31.767 --> 01:01:32.967
- Don't mention it.

01:01:41.067 --> 01:01:43.067
(paper rustling)

01:01:47.967 --> 01:01:51.500
(ominous atmosphere music)

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:02.167
- Dawson!

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:07.333
Dawson, what are you doing?

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.667
- Nothing.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:15.467
- All right that's fine,
let's go, mom's waiting.

01:03:05.367 --> 01:03:07.700
[Jo] My name is Jo Lee-Haywood

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.067
and in the spring of 1982...

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:12.067
...I murdered my father.

01:03:13.367 --> 01:03:18.367
(ominous western music)

01:03:21.167 --> 01:03:24.233
His name was Jesse M. Picken.

01:03:25.167 --> 01:03:27.267
And he was a fucking drunk.

01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:32.667
And doing what fucking drunks do

01:03:32.667 --> 01:03:36.300
Jesse would often drink himself
to death and resort to violence.

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:43.233
Unprovoked,
unnecessary violence.

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:46.567
(screaming)

01:03:48.067 --> 01:03:50.733
After nearly killing my mother
in a drunken stroke of rage,

01:03:50.733 --> 01:03:55.100
Jesse M. Picken
had finally met his end.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:04:00.400
At the hands of his
three baby daughters.

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.667
Doris, May, and me.

01:04:09.467 --> 01:04:13.300
Collectively referred
to as "The Three Dames."

01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:20.267
Broke, but ambitious,

01:04:20.267 --> 01:04:24.200
my sisters and I decided to go
into business for ourselves.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.367
Robbing banks,

01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:29.733
robbing people,

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.600
and sometimes...

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.233
murder.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.967
Five years later, and
our name became a brand.

01:04:41.967 --> 01:04:44.300
My sisters and I were in charge

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:49.200
of the largest Dixie Mafia in
the great state of Tennessee.

01:04:50.067 --> 01:04:53.500
(dramatic orchestra music)

01:04:59.467 --> 01:05:02.567
But this all changed
the day I met...

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:04.167
"him"

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.467
One day our car was stopped
on our way back home

01:05:10.467 --> 01:05:12.800
from a weekend with our
youngest daughter Lily.

01:05:13.533 --> 01:05:16.733
(brakes screeching)

01:05:17.467 --> 01:05:20.767
(dramatic western music)

01:05:32.633 --> 01:05:35.133
Jake "The Baker" Lando.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:40.400
A local crime boss who wanted
to make a name for himself

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:45.767
decided to build his
brand as the man who took
down the three sisters.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.767
The infamous Dames Gang.

01:05:49.133 --> 01:05:51.800
That dame was me.

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:56.367
He decided to put
an end to my life

01:05:56.367 --> 01:05:58.333
and take my family away from me.

01:05:58.333 --> 01:06:00.733
(gunshots)

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:07.933
After four months
in a coma, I awoke.

01:06:08.667 --> 01:06:11.067
(heart monitor beeping)

01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:15.700
I snuck into my own house like a
thief in the middle of the night

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.633
grabbed what's left of
my family, and fled.

01:06:19.633 --> 01:06:21.600
600 miles north.

01:06:22.467 --> 01:06:23.967
To what then was considered the

01:06:23.967 --> 01:06:26.400
small boomtown of
Port City, Michigan.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.600
I bought a house in the suburbs,

01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.467
opened a neighborhood bar
with my daughter Scarlet,

01:06:37.467 --> 01:06:41.167
and worked as hard as I
could to start my life anew.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:44.067
Eventually my brother
Boone followed suit.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.133
As for the man who
tried to kill me.

01:06:49.867 --> 01:06:53.067
(dramatic thumping)

01:06:53.067 --> 01:06:58.067
Like old Jesse before him,
Jake "The Baker" Lando

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:02.467
met his end at the hands
of the two Dame sisters.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.133
May and Doris.

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:10.967
(screaming)

01:07:17.067 --> 01:07:19.067
(birds chirping)

01:07:19.767 --> 01:07:21.967
(echoing footsteps)

01:07:21.967 --> 01:07:25.233
(suspenseful music)

01:07:30.633 --> 01:07:32.467
(water running)

01:08:02.333 --> 01:08:04.600
(knocking)

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:07.767
- Dawson come on, let's go.
Mom's waiting.

01:08:09.933 --> 01:08:11.400
What are you doing?

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:12.433
- Nothing.

01:08:18.832 --> 01:08:20.167
- What's that doing in here?

01:08:22.867 --> 01:08:24.933
Dawson, what is
that doing in here?

01:08:24.933 --> 01:08:27.067
- I found it, I
wanted to read it.

01:08:27.067 --> 01:08:28.567
- Where did you find it?

01:08:28.567 --> 01:08:29.567
- Mom's room.

01:08:30.767 --> 01:08:32.700
- And you thought you
could just take it?

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:33.600
- Yeah.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:34.767
- Why?

01:08:34.767 --> 01:08:36.399
- Because I wanted to read it.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:38.300
- Well it wasn't for you
to read, what made you

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.733
think you could just
walk into mom's room and

01:08:39.733 --> 01:08:41.800
steal her journal, what's
the matter with you?

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.800
Give it to me!

01:08:48.466 --> 01:08:49.600
Did you read it?

01:08:53.332 --> 01:08:54.399
All of it?

01:08:56.067 --> 01:08:56.933
- [Jo] Scarlet!

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:58.767
Dawson!

01:08:58.767 --> 01:08:59.899
- Move it.

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:01.233
Come on, move it.

01:09:05.533 --> 01:09:06.466
Jesus.

01:09:11.667 --> 01:09:13.167
- I have to go potty.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.332
- I'll take her.

01:09:15.332 --> 01:09:16.767
- No no, stay here
with Dawson, here.

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:20.133
All right, quick quick quick
quick quick quick quick.

01:09:36.067 --> 01:09:39.767
- Look, Dawson, I'm
sorry for yelling at you.

01:09:43.966 --> 01:09:46.267
- Don't worry about
it, I deserved it.

01:09:47.466 --> 01:09:52.133
- Well I took care
of it, all right?

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.700
It's fine, I'm not
gonna rat you out.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.100
- [Dawson] Thanks.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.400
(ominous atmosphere music)

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.567
So mom's kinda a
badass ain't she?

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.700
- Yeah, that's uh..

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.267
That's one way of looking at it.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.867
It's gonna be all right, okay?

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.300
- Let me take a look at you.

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.833
You okay?

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:35.500
Okay.

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.667
(screaming and gunshot)

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:40.567
(internal ringing)

01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.400
(screaming)

01:10:56.333 --> 01:10:57.567
- No!!

01:10:57.567 --> 01:11:02.333
(crying)

01:11:02.333 --> 01:11:05.500
(inaudible scream)

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.300
(rubmling base)

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:13.933
(somber music)

01:11:23.267 --> 01:11:26.900
* Faith in a God I don't know

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.333
* Asked Him 'why',
He said 'no' *

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:36.333
* Have you ever been so alone

01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:43.367
* Men dressed up for Sunday

01:11:43.367 --> 01:11:47.567
* They bow their
heads for 'someday' *

01:11:47.567 --> 01:11:51.700
* Have you ever questioned?

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:55.433
* I know

01:11:55.433 --> 01:11:59.600
* We count our daily blessings

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.533
* Forgive and get trespassings

01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:07.933
* The emptiness is lasting

01:12:07.933 --> 01:12:11.533
* So long

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:24.433
* Amen

01:12:24.433 --> 01:12:29.433
* Amen

01:12:31.733 --> 01:12:36.067
* Amen

01:12:48.067 --> 01:12:52.067
- [Jo] To my bright
and talented star.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:55.933
Make you keep shining forever.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.167
Love, dad.

01:13:03.433 --> 01:13:06.700
(heavy boots steps)

01:13:21.333 --> 01:13:26.333
(somber western music)
(whistling)

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.567
- Hello, June Bug.

01:14:06.267 --> 01:14:07.900
Long time no see.

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:26.733
Who did this to you?

01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:32.633
(reciever)

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:33.800
- [Sam] Hello, Jo.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:36.400
- [Jo] Who is this?

01:14:37.267 --> 01:14:39.567
- I think you know who this is.

01:14:39.567 --> 01:14:41.567
I think you know
who I'm working for.

01:14:42.767 --> 01:14:45.200
And I think you know
why I'm calling.

01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.433
- You have her.

01:14:48.167 --> 01:14:49.433
You have my daughter.

01:14:50.867 --> 01:14:53.567
- You and I are gonna have
ourselves a little meeting.

01:14:53.567 --> 01:14:55.300
Your bar, midnight.

01:14:56.267 --> 01:15:00.300
If I see a cop, she dies.

01:15:01.233 --> 01:15:05.167
If I see a gun, she dies.

01:15:06.933 --> 01:15:11.933
If I see your
hillbilly, redneck,

01:15:12.667 --> 01:15:15.467
cow-fucking brother,

01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:16.800
She dies.

01:15:18.433 --> 01:15:20.667
You give me what I want

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.567
and I will give you your
little darling back.

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:27.633
- I wanna talk to her, I
wanna talk to my daughter,
you put her on the line.

01:15:29.967 --> 01:15:31.133
Do it!

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.500
- Midnight.

01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:37.300
(disconnect tone)

01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:40.200
(heavy breathing)

01:15:46.067 --> 01:15:48.700
(epic rock western music)

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:59.333
* Bite the bullet baby we
all got our own enemies *

01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:06.700
* Locked and loaded
won't you pour * me out
a glass of gasoline *

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:13.700
* Set me on fire

01:16:16.967 --> 01:16:21.967
* Set me on fire

01:16:26.067 --> 01:16:31.067
* Go ahead and pull it, bang
bang, down on my knees *

01:16:32.633 --> 01:16:37.633
* Set me on fire

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:45.800
* Set me on fire

01:16:50.133 --> 01:16:53.900
* Now they say whatever
doesn't kill you *

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.500
* Will only make you stronger

01:16:58.500 --> 01:17:03.500
* But I say, whatever doesn't
kill me, it better run *

01:17:06.133 --> 01:17:11.133
* Bite the bullet baby we
all got our own enemies *

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:18.900
* Locked and loaded
won't you pour * me out
a glass of gasoline *

01:17:20.833 --> 01:17:25.833
* And set me on fire

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:32.333
- [Jo] Pain.

01:17:34.533 --> 01:17:39.533
For most people, the
suffering of pain is as
intolerable as death itself.

01:17:41.733 --> 01:17:46.067
The agony associated
with physical, mental,

01:17:46.067 --> 01:17:49.433
or even spiritual pain,
is potent enough to
drive sane folks into

01:17:49.433 --> 01:17:51.400
the edge of insanity.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.800
And throw them off
the fucking cliff.

01:17:56.967 --> 01:17:59.667
But I am not 'most people'.

01:17:59.667 --> 01:18:02.067
(dramatic music)

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.500
Pain runs through my veins.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.733
It has poisoned my blood.

01:18:09.667 --> 01:18:11.567
I've got the scars to show it.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.500
- Good evening.

01:18:21.100 --> 01:18:21.800
Check her.

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:22.667
- With pleasure.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:32.833
Spread 'em.

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:34.133
Spread 'em!

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.133
She's clean.

01:18:40.067 --> 01:18:41.100
Ow!

01:18:41.567 --> 01:18:42.267
My eye!

01:18:46.733 --> 01:18:48.767
- That wasn't very nice.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:49.967
- Where's my daughter?

01:18:49.967 --> 01:18:51.467
- All in good time.

01:18:51.467 --> 01:18:52.833
Take a seat.

01:18:52.833 --> 01:18:54.067
- I'd rather stand.

01:18:54.067 --> 01:18:55.767
- I don't give a shit
what you'd rather.

01:18:55.767 --> 01:18:57.333
Take a seat.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:18:58.333
- Sit the fuck down.

01:19:10.733 --> 01:19:13.933
- Two men entered your bar to
have a little chat with you.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:15.967
They never made it out.

01:19:19.933 --> 01:19:21.300
Where are they?

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:23.733
- I don't know.

01:19:26.733 --> 01:19:29.067
- You just broke a
very important rule!

01:19:29.067 --> 01:19:30.633
You lied to me!

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.967
I'm gonna ask you again.

01:19:33.967 --> 01:19:36.100
Two men, where are they?

01:19:38.767 --> 01:19:41.333
(laughs)

01:19:47.067 --> 01:19:47.833
Micky.

01:19:47.833 --> 01:19:48.767
- [Micky] Yeah boss?

01:19:48.767 --> 01:19:49.567
- You got the girl with you?

01:19:49.567 --> 01:19:50.600
- [Micky] Yes sir.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.433
- Good.

01:19:54.733 --> 01:19:55.767
Let 'er rip.

01:19:55.767 --> 01:19:57.133
(Scarlet screaming)

01:19:57.133 --> 01:19:58.933
- No, no no no!

01:19:58.933 --> 01:20:00.067
(Music intensifies)

01:20:00.067 --> 01:20:00.933
(Scarlet screaming)

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.200
(screaming)

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.200
(kicking)

01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.067
(Jo grunting)

01:20:08.067 --> 01:20:09.467
- Get her up, put
her on the chair.

01:20:17.533 --> 01:20:19.633
(laughing)

01:20:21.933 --> 01:20:23.233
Look at you!

01:20:26.167 --> 01:20:30.167
Hot damn girl, you got
a lot of fight in you.

01:20:31.833 --> 01:20:35.533
- I just want to
see my daughter.

01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:37.900
- First thing's first.

01:20:39.133 --> 01:20:40.967
We're gonna make a
little phone call.

01:20:46.733 --> 01:20:49.333
Mr. Frank, this is Sam Barone.

01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:52.233
I have something for you.

01:20:53.567 --> 01:20:55.767
Hey, guess what?

01:20:56.667 --> 01:20:57.833
It's for you.

01:21:03.567 --> 01:21:05.233
- Good evening.

01:21:05.233 --> 01:21:07.133
I'm going to ask you
some questions

01:21:07.133 --> 01:21:10.667
and I need you to answer them
straight and to the point.

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:13.600
If you fail to provide me with a
reasonable response,

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:17.567
or allude to any issue
you may presently have
with this conversation,

01:21:17.567 --> 01:21:21.200
we will be forced to stop and
start the process over again.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.633
Understood?

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:24.600
- Yes.

01:21:25.767 --> 01:21:26.900
- Okay.

01:21:28.067 --> 01:21:29.367
(button clicks)

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:32.333
Your full name please.

01:21:35.067 --> 01:21:36.133
Address.

01:21:38.733 --> 01:21:39.767
Phone number.

01:21:43.167 --> 01:21:45.067
And your social security number.

01:21:47.267 --> 01:21:51.367
I'm obligated by law to
read you the following
terms and conditions.

01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:54.200
It's a standard transfer
of ownership agreement.

01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:57.733
It'll take a few minutes.
At the end, if you agree,

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:01.067
please say "I agree."

01:22:03.067 --> 01:22:04.300
- I agree.

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:06.667
(button clicks)

01:22:12.067 --> 01:22:13.133
- Yes.

01:22:13.867 --> 01:22:14.967
Thank you.

01:22:16.067 --> 01:22:17.567
- You got what you want.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:19.833
Now where is my daughter?

01:22:23.133 --> 01:22:24.167
- Bring her in!

01:22:27.267 --> 01:22:30.100
(ominous atmosphere music)

01:22:41.633 --> 01:22:43.167
- Mom, mom!

01:22:43.167 --> 01:22:45.067
- Eh eh eh eh eh!

01:22:45.767 --> 01:22:47.600
Don't you fucking move.

01:22:49.367 --> 01:22:50.900
- You got what you want.

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:52.900
You let her go.

01:22:55.833 --> 01:22:59.367
- There's one thing I want just
for my own fucking satisfaction.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.067
Get on your knees or
the bitch gets it.

01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:06.500
Now!

01:23:10.633 --> 01:23:13.733
You got too much fucking
pride, you smug bitch.

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.433
I wanna see you cry.

01:23:18.700 --> 01:23:20.900
I want you to give me
everything you got.

01:23:20.900 --> 01:23:23.400
I want you to fucking beg me!

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.833
Not to put a bullet through
her pretty little head.

01:23:28.067 --> 01:23:30.067
I'm gonna give you 30
seconds to convince me.

01:23:30.067 --> 01:23:31.233
Go!

01:23:31.233 --> 01:23:32.433
- Please do not touch my baby.

01:23:32.433 --> 01:23:33.767
- That was weak!

01:23:33.767 --> 01:23:35.467
- Please do not touch my baby.

01:23:35.467 --> 01:23:37.833
- Come on, 20 seconds.

01:23:37.833 --> 01:23:39.767
- Do not touch her,
do not hurt her.

01:23:39.767 --> 01:23:42.067
- [Sam] Jesus Christ this is
weak, she does not love you.

01:23:42.067 --> 01:23:42.833
- You let her go.

01:23:42.833 --> 01:23:43.633
- Come on.

01:23:43.633 --> 01:23:44.700
- You let her go!

01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:45.367
You let her go!

01:23:45.367 --> 01:23:46.833
15 seconds!

01:23:46.833 --> 01:23:49.433
- Let her go, please,
please let her go, please!

01:23:49.433 --> 01:23:53.400
- Seven, six, four, three.
- Please, let her go, please!

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:54.633
- Please let her go, please!

01:23:54.633 --> 01:23:56.167
- Beg me not to
shoot this bitch!

01:23:56.167 --> 01:23:57.300
- Please!

01:23:57.300 --> 01:23:58.567
- You want me to
fucking off this bitch?

01:23:58.567 --> 01:23:59.433
- Please let her go!!

01:23:59.433 --> 01:24:01.733
Then you fucking beg me!

01:24:01.733 --> 01:24:03.067
- Please!

01:24:03.067 --> 01:24:05.633
Please don't hurt her, please!

01:24:05.633 --> 01:24:08.500
Please don't hurt
my baby, please!

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.600
Please!

01:24:10.767 --> 01:24:14.067
Please do not kill
my baby, please!

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.467
Plea... Please...Please!

01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:21.067
Please, please!

01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:25.267
(sobbing)

01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:36.067
(crying)

01:24:43.733 --> 01:24:45.067
- Now you two

01:24:45.067 --> 01:24:47.400
Get the fuck outta here!

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:48.400
Go!

01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:56.267
Oh, and wave
goodbye to your bar.

01:24:56.267 --> 01:24:59.300
Or should I say my bar?

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.067
(laughs)

01:25:01.067 --> 01:25:02.733
- Run.

01:25:02.733 --> 01:25:04.800
- Oh, and uh, enjoy...
- [Scarlet] What?

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:08.467
- ...the ride home to your
fucking farm or wherever
it is you came from!

01:25:08.467 --> 01:25:09.533
- Run!

01:25:10.667 --> 01:25:12.433
This is the way
it's gonna go down.

01:25:12.433 --> 01:25:14.167
(deep base)

01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:19.267
You don't make a move,
until I know that she's safe.

01:25:24.433 --> 01:25:26.567
And if you have to choose...

01:25:29.933 --> 01:25:31.133
You choose her.

01:25:38.533 --> 01:25:40.400
Is that understood?

01:25:49.167 --> 01:25:50.300
May!

01:25:55.267 --> 01:25:56.267
- Yes, ma'am.

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:59.300
- Run!

01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.333
(suspenseful music)

01:26:01.067 --> 01:26:02.700
- Get her, get her!

01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:04.067
- [Henchman] Oh shit.
- [Henchman #2] What the fuck?!

01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:06.400
(gunfire, screaming)

01:26:12.967 --> 01:26:13.867
(Sam grunts)

01:26:13.867 --> 01:26:15.833
(bullet shells falling)

01:26:18.867 --> 01:26:21.167
(Sam panting heavily)

01:26:23.533 --> 01:26:24.533
(Sam groaning)

01:26:26.067 --> 01:26:29.067
(footsteps on broken glass)

01:26:35.667 --> 01:26:37.333
- You fucking bitch.

01:26:39.533 --> 01:26:41.067
You're gonna fucking pay.

01:26:42.167 --> 01:26:43.833
You're gonna fucking
pay for this.

01:26:44.633 --> 01:26:45.667
- Sure.

01:26:46.833 --> 01:26:50.467
You got my voice on a
recording somewhere.

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.667
You got my signature
on a piece of paper.

01:26:56.267 --> 01:26:58.233
But the only problem is...

01:27:00.267 --> 01:27:01.967
It ain't my bar.

01:27:03.633 --> 01:27:07.933
I can't legally sell you
something I don't own, can I?

01:27:10.533 --> 01:27:12.967
So, when your friend,

01:27:13.833 --> 01:27:15.633
Mr. Frank

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.167
tries to change the
name on that title

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:22.267
he's gonna be in for
a little surprise.

01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:27.533
- Mr. DeVitto, we
have a problem.

01:27:29.767 --> 01:27:34.533
- The title to this bar
is hidden in a small
box, in my office.

01:27:35.633 --> 01:27:37.867
Wrapped in a pretty
little ribbon.

01:27:37.867 --> 01:27:41.267
With a card next
to it that reads...

01:27:42.333 --> 01:27:44.367
"You deserve this, baby."

01:27:46.133 --> 01:27:47.433
"Happy birthday."

01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:52.667
I gave it to my
daughter, Scarlet.

01:27:54.967 --> 01:27:58.067
It's her name on the title.

01:27:58.067 --> 01:27:59.567
Not mine.

01:28:04.733 --> 01:28:07.367
It seems to me.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.367
That you.

01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:11.767
Don't.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.100
Own.

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:16.100
Shit.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:18.867
Sammy boy.

01:28:20.267 --> 01:28:22.600
- Who the fuck are you people?

01:28:23.467 --> 01:28:26.367
(Spaghetti Western music)

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:29.400
- You come into my
place of business.

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.300
You threaten my family.

01:28:37.867 --> 01:28:40.067
You kidnap my daughter.

01:28:42.067 --> 01:28:44.067
You murder my son.

01:28:47.733 --> 01:28:50.133
(dramatic music escelates)

01:29:08.167 --> 01:29:10.500
(screaming)

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.733
(groaning)

01:29:38.833 --> 01:29:41.500
(gunshot)

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:57.300
(dramatic rockabilly music)

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:43.000
(phone buzzing)

01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.433
- It's for you.

01:31:03.267 --> 01:31:04.200
- The fuck?

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:05.467
What the fuck are you doing?

01:31:05.467 --> 01:31:07.433
(brakes screeching)

01:31:09.067 --> 01:31:10.067
(grunts)

01:31:20.733 --> 01:31:22.833
Who the fuck are you?

01:31:23.433 --> 01:31:25.300
(wind blowing)

01:31:26.067 --> 01:31:27.167
- Are you scared?

01:31:29.867 --> 01:31:32.100
Are you frightened?

01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:33.800
It's okay if you are.

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:38.333
Folks like you, they say
'I ain't scared of no girl.'

01:31:39.467 --> 01:31:44.433
Your boy, Jimmy.
Your boy, Momo, Sam,

01:31:44.433 --> 01:31:47.900
whoever the fuck, they
all say the same thing.

01:31:49.133 --> 01:31:51.367
But when you put a
gun to their head

01:31:53.067 --> 01:31:54.567
When you

01:31:54.567 --> 01:31:59.533
are just about to
squeeze that trigger.

01:32:02.633 --> 01:32:05.067
Human instinct kicks in.

01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:09.067
And they start crying.

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:12.300
And they start shaking.

01:32:13.733 --> 01:32:16.400
And they get real,

01:32:17.133 --> 01:32:20.067
real scared.

01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.667
- Pickings.

01:32:25.567 --> 01:32:28.133
You got some pair of
balls on you, lady.

01:32:29.167 --> 01:32:31.067
Pulling a stunt like that.

01:32:34.933 --> 01:32:37.367
Well, Jo.

01:32:40.067 --> 01:32:45.067
I can't say that it's a
pleasure to finally meet you,
considering the circumstances.

01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:50.100
Please, don't take offense.

01:32:50.833 --> 01:32:53.300
(country rock music)

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.700
(chuckles)

01:33:18.467 --> 01:33:21.667
You better do what
you came here to do.

01:33:22.933 --> 01:33:25.500
I ain't got all day, toots.

01:33:30.533 --> 01:33:33.600
- Fuck you.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:35.300
- Yeah.

01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:37.067
Pretty much.

01:33:37.767 --> 01:33:40.100
Fuck you, too!

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:42.200
(gunshot)

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.867
(Scarlet sobbing)

01:34:03.233 --> 01:34:07.133
(dramatic western music)

01:34:26.067 --> 01:34:29.600
- [Jo] They say that
whatever doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

01:34:30.467 --> 01:34:32.700
I'm a living proof of that.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:35.100
And I've got the
scars to show it.

01:34:36.067 --> 01:34:38.667
Every scar you carry,

01:34:38.667 --> 01:34:40.500
every bad memory,

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:45.067
is an indication of how
strong you actually are

01:34:45.067 --> 01:34:47.800
How much you've endured,

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.700
and how, against all odds,

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:52.400
You survived.

01:34:54.900 --> 01:34:58.567
People say you need to
forget about the bad things.

01:34:58.567 --> 01:35:02.200
Forget the painful
memories, let them go.

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.833
But if you do that, you
lost the value of the scar.

01:35:08.067 --> 01:35:10.900
The pain was suffered
and nothing gained.

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.733
Fear overtook you,

01:35:14.733 --> 01:35:18.367
and the scar you carry,
has made you weaker.

01:35:18.367 --> 01:35:20.433
Not stronger.

01:35:22.867 --> 01:35:26.833
You just gotta realize that
some scars will never heal.

01:35:26.833 --> 01:35:29.667
Some memories will burn forever.

01:35:32.967 --> 01:35:37.267
But when you see them,
when you feel them,

01:35:37.867 --> 01:35:39.300
you gotta smile.

01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:42.633
You've endured.

01:35:44.067 --> 01:35:45.100
You survived.

01:35:53.367 --> 01:35:57.767
(dramatic acoustic guitar music)

01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:21.300
* When she was a child,
she was a little wild *

01:36:22.767 --> 01:36:27.267
* She didn't play with toys
She wouldn't look at boys *

01:36:28.167 --> 01:36:31.400
* She had a way of her own

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:35.600
* Now she's up and grown

01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:40.200
* Ooo boy, nothing's
gonna save you *

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.200
* Oh Lord, praise the
one who made you *

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:48.167
* Ooh child, holy
water tremble *

01:36:48.167 --> 01:36:51.433
* You know when the
night is coming for ya *

01:36:51.433 --> 01:36:54.367
* Ain't nothing stops the
sooner from the later *

01:36:54.367 --> 01:36:57.333
* So life threw you
down the wrong road? *

01:36:57.333 --> 01:37:01.067
* Hold tight, baby,
that's the way it goes... *

01:37:04.633 --> 01:37:07.667
* Now they call her a 'Lady'

01:37:07.667 --> 01:37:10.567
* The noise, it made her crazy

01:37:10.567 --> 01:37:14.067
* Still the years went on by

01:37:14.067 --> 01:37:17.133
* So did her alibi

01:37:17.133 --> 01:37:20.233
* She got some kids of her own

01:37:20.233 --> 01:37:24.067
* Now they're up and grown

01:37:24.067 --> 01:37:28.533
* Look now, devil's
got your running *

01:37:28.533 --> 01:37:33.200
* From what? Baby
are you stumbling *

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.733
* Don't blink, death
is such a gamble *

01:37:36.733 --> 01:37:39.933
* You know when the
night is coming for you *

01:37:39.933 --> 01:37:42.900
* Ain't nothing stops
the sooner or the later *

01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:45.867
* So life threw you
down the wrong road? *

01:37:45.867 --> 01:37:50.867
* Hold tight, baby,
that's the way it goes... *

01:38:02.333 --> 01:38:05.533
* Don't pick a fight

01:38:05.533 --> 01:38:08.267
* With a dog who bites

01:38:08.267 --> 01:38:11.367
* She gonna leave
a mark, where *

01:38:11.367 --> 01:38:14.667
* She'll tear you apart there

01:38:14.667 --> 01:38:17.800
* You're such a fool

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:21.100
* And she's so cruel

01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:24.067
* You're gonna sit and pray

01:38:24.067 --> 01:38:29.067
* To live another day

01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:35.700
* You know when the
night is coming for you *

01:38:35.700 --> 01:38:38.667
* Ain't nothing stops the
sooner from the later *

01:38:38.667 --> 01:38:41.933
* So life threw you
down the wrong road? *

01:38:41.933 --> 01:38:46.933
* Hold tight, baby,
that's the way it goes... *

01:38:50.067 --> 01:38:55.067
* The way it goes,
the way it goes *

01:39:09.967 --> 01:39:11.900
- 66, D-2.

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:17.300
(jazzy swing music)

01:39:31.833 --> 01:39:33.733
- Watch out!
- Wooo!

01:39:36.667 --> 01:39:38.067
- Let 'er rip.

01:39:39.467 --> 01:39:41.633
I don't have a cell phone
in my hand. (laughter)

01:39:42.367 --> 01:39:43.300
- [Jo] I realize that!

01:39:44.433 --> 01:39:46.900
Sorry, hold on
one second, sorry.

01:39:46.900 --> 01:39:47.733
I'm sorry.

01:39:52.100 --> 01:39:56.067
- My my, you're a hot little
piece of potato aren't you?

01:39:56.067 --> 01:39:57.700
Hi, the name's Trace.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:40:00.067
So nice to meet you,
I'm new in town.

01:40:00.900 --> 01:40:02.467
Single, not married or anything.

01:40:04.267 --> 01:40:06.000
Single, ready to mingle.

01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:09.267
I like wine.

01:40:10.433 --> 01:40:12.900
What do you say you get
me a glass of it, huh?

01:40:13.367 --> 01:40:14.333
Yeah?

01:40:15.733 --> 01:40:18.600
All right then, good, let's
just cut the bull here.

01:40:20.067 --> 01:40:23.733
I am not wearing any socks and
I got the panties to match if

01:40:23.733 --> 01:40:25.233
you know what I mean.

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:26.900
Mmm?

01:40:27.833 --> 01:40:29.900
Oh God, why did I just say that?

01:40:29.900 --> 01:40:32.500
Oh no.

01:40:34.133 --> 01:40:36.300
Oh, but then again,
I am at that age

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:39.900
where I guess you need someone,
so I don't know.

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:42.400
What do you say you
and I will just...

01:40:43.267 --> 01:40:46.467
God dangit.

01:41:04.333 --> 01:41:05.233
- [Director] Cut!

01:41:05.233 --> 01:41:07.400
(laughter)
