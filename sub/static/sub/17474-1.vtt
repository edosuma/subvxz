You have your writing.
All I have is the waiting.

44:14.217 --> 44:16.632
I can't wait anymore.

44:16.633 --> 44:17.799
Oh.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.632
5, 6, 7, 8, action!

44:19.633 --> 44:21.000
Action!

44:24.550 --> 44:26.758
It's Ivy's part.
She has Marilyn's soul.

44:26.759 --> 44:28.966
She has her body.
She looks like Marilyn.

44:28.967 --> 44:34.091
♪ If you say something is taboo
that's the thing I wanna do ♪

44:34.092 --> 44:38.299
♪ Do it, to it, black and blue
let's be bad ♪

44:38.300 --> 44:40.841
I thought Karen's dancing was good.

44:40.842 --> 44:43.451
She might be green, but
she's certainly trained.

44:46.425 --> 44:49.557
Ivy can act, she can dance,
and she has Broadway experience.

44:51.550 --> 44:53.550
Experience is precisely
what we're not looking for.

44:53.551 --> 44:56.355
In fact, innocence, that
freshness, is very Marilyn.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.393
Yeah, I know what I
bring to the party.

45:03.466 --> 45:05.924
I could have slept with him.

45:05.925 --> 45:07.842
You're not that
good in bed either.

45:07.843 --> 45:09.507
Okay.

45:09.508 --> 45:12.133
I fired you once,
I can do it again.

45:12.134 --> 45:16.040
And then we'll see if it sticks because
it kinda didn't the last time. Did it?

45:18.675 --> 45:20.667
Don't get ahead of yourself.

45:21.383 --> 45:22.381
I'm worried about money.

45:22.382 --> 45:23.217
I can cover us.

45:23.218 --> 45:25.053
I don't know if I'm ready for that.

45:26.217 --> 45:27.771
Julia, hi.

45:29.134 --> 45:30.757
Show's great, I'm in.

45:30.758 --> 45:31.632
Wow.

45:31.633 --> 45:32.968
See ya.

45:35.800 --> 45:36.840
Where's the money?

45:36.841 --> 45:37.758
We are trying to figure that out.

45:37.759 --> 45:39.923
Your husband is very clever.

45:41.633 --> 45:43.984
Karen, show her how to do this.

45:44.506 --> 45:46.257
So you feel good about our choice?

45:46.259 --> 45:49.516
There's a broken heart for
every light on Broadway.

45:54.172 --> 45:58.867
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Marilyn
