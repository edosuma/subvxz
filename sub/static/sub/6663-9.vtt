ADULT ADAM:  <i>Ah,</i>
<i>there was nothing quite like</i>

00:02.169 --> 00:03.902
<i>Thanksgiving</i>
<i>in the Goldberg house.</i>

00:03.904 --> 00:05.404
<i>My mom gave it</i>
<i>her heart and soul,</i>

00:05.406 --> 00:06.872
<i>and all she</i>
<i>wanted in return</i>

00:06.874 --> 00:08.440
<i>was for her family</i>
<i>to sit around the table</i>

00:08.442 --> 00:11.543
<i>and give thanks...</i>
<i>To her.</i>

00:11.545 --> 00:13.746
Okay, turkey's been basted,

00:13.748 --> 00:16.148
and the yams
are marshmallowed.

00:16.383 --> 00:17.282
My job is done.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.517
Maybe it's time for you
to do your jobs

00:18.519 --> 00:20.786
and spend
the next few hours
thinking about

00:20.788 --> 00:24.623
the thing or person
that you're most thankful for.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.325
Bon Jovi's ass.
Darryl Dawkins.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.494
Harrison Ford.
He's Indiana Jones, Han Solo,

00:28.496 --> 00:31.330
and...little-known fact...
He's a trained carpenter.

00:31.332 --> 00:32.131
He can make us a gazebo.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.401
Everyone out. Go get dressed
and think about your answers

00:35.403 --> 00:37.202
while I'm here
slaving away.

00:37.204 --> 00:40.239
And he was underappreciated
in  <i>"Blade Runner."</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:42.641
Harrison Ford sucks.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.610
"Underappreciated,"
you say?

00:44.612 --> 00:45.344
That does suck.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.713
Which none of us
should be saying.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.547
That's a terrible word.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.482
<i>But instead of going</i>
<i>upstairs to change...</i>

00:50.484 --> 00:51.784
(BOTH SHOUTING) Ball-Ball!
<i>We went downstairs...</i>

00:51.786 --> 00:54.453
<i>To play the greatest sport</i>
<i>of all time.</i>

00:54.455 --> 00:56.288
<i>Like all bored siblings,</i>
<i>my brother and I</i>

00:56.290 --> 00:57.890
<i>invented a ton</i>
<i>of different games...</i>

00:57.892 --> 00:58.957

(ADAM GRUNTS)

00:58.959 --> 01:02.961
<i>But this was our favorite.</i>
<i>It was called...</i>

01:02.963 --> 01:04.930
Ball-ball! Yes!

01:04.932 --> 01:06.965
That was on a breakaway,
so it's 6 points

01:06.967 --> 01:08.834
plus a bonus round!
(PANTING)

01:08.836 --> 01:11.070
<i>Like every game I played</i>
<i>with my big brother,</i>

01:11.072 --> 01:12.304
<i>I had never once won.</i>

01:12.306 --> 01:14.039
<i>It was so bad,</i>
<i>the ball-ball trophy</i>

01:14.041 --> 01:16.075
<i>was even named after him.</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:18.911
And the coveted Barry cup

01:18.913 --> 01:21.513

01:21.515 --> 01:22.915

Knock it off.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.922
Enough with the ball-ball.

01:29.924 --> 01:32.091
Your mother told you
to get dressed.

01:32.093 --> 01:32.891
She told you, too.

01:32.893 --> 01:36.128
I'm one move away.
You're four!

01:36.130 --> 01:36.662
Now move it!

01:36.664 --> 01:38.897
I'm not gonna have you ruin
your mother's Thanksgiving.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.966
<i>But it wasn't us that always</i>
<i>ruined Thanksgiving.</i>

01:40.968 --> 01:42.701
<i>No, that title went</i>
<i>to my Uncle Marvin.</i>

01:42.703 --> 01:46.171
But, seriously, why do
we have to invite him
every year?

01:46.173 --> 01:47.172
'Cause Marvin's your brother

01:47.174 --> 01:48.874
and the only family
you've got?

01:48.876 --> 01:51.710
No. I've got you,
I got what's-her-name,

01:51.712 --> 01:54.713
I got the two morons
in the basement. I'm good.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.482
Look, every year
you two fight,

01:56.484 --> 01:58.283
and Marvin ends up
storming out

01:58.285 --> 01:59.084
before we even sit down.

01:59.086 --> 02:01.720
For once, can't you just
take all the negative feelings

02:01.722 --> 02:04.389
and spin them
into a positive?
How?

02:04.391 --> 02:05.858
He's never even had a job.

02:05.860 --> 02:07.926
Positive spin...
He's a free spirit.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.728
You can't put a price
on that.

02:09.730 --> 02:12.030
Oh. How's 900 bucks
for starters?

02:12.032 --> 02:15.367
That's how much I paid
for his bartending school,

02:15.369 --> 02:17.669
and he flunked out.
Who does that?

02:17.671 --> 02:18.670
I'll tell you who.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.038
Tom Cruise
in the movie  <i>"Cocktail,"</i>

02:20.040 --> 02:22.441
and you know how
that ended for him.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.909
Hmm.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.744
Well, actually,
I never saw that movie,

02:25.746 --> 02:28.380
but I assume he won over
the whole city

02:28.382 --> 02:29.615
with his fancy drinks.

02:29.617 --> 02:33.519
Fine! When he gets here,
I will try and be nice to him.

02:33.521 --> 02:36.388
You know what, hon?
With a new positive attitude,

02:36.390 --> 02:39.525

08:05.252 --> 08:09.087
Do you have insurance?
Why? No!

08:09.155 --> 08:10.889
Oh, my God!

08:10.891 --> 08:12.190
No!

08:12.192 --> 08:13.024
No!

08:13.026 --> 08:15.227
You didn't put
the parking brake on!

08:15.229 --> 08:19.764
Moron! No! Please!
(SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY)

08:24.770 --> 08:26.805
Moron! (WAILS)

08:26.807 --> 08:28.106
Oh, gosh!

08:28.108 --> 08:29.140
Okay. Uhh!

08:29.142 --> 08:31.443
It's just a dent!
It's just a dent.

08:31.445 --> 08:34.212
You're lucky this thing
was built in America.

08:34.214 --> 08:34.713

08:34.715 --> 08:37.949

(METAL CREAKING)

08:40.753 --> 08:42.020
You bent the frame!

08:42.022 --> 08:43.855
<i>Yep. He bent the frame.</i>

08:43.857 --> 08:47.225
<i>I thought the car looked</i>
<i>even more awesome like this.</i>

08:47.227 --> 08:48.059
Hey, pal.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.661
<i>But my uncle did not agree.</i>

08:49.663 --> 08:52.130
He bent the frame!
What...really?

08:52.132 --> 08:53.899
He bent the frame!

08:54.700 --> 08:57.269
<i>Now that my dad</i>
<i>and Uncle Marv</i>
<i>were getting along,</i>

08:57.271 --> 09:00.238
<i>my mom was finally</i>
<i>gonna get her thanks.</i>

09:00.240 --> 09:01.339
Okay, they're back!

09:01.341 --> 09:03.742
<i>Or so she thought.</i>

09:04.043 --> 09:04.509
Everyone...

09:04.511 --> 09:08.113
Let's all sit at the table
and say our thanks...
(DOOR CLOSES)

09:08.115 --> 09:09.681
To whoever
that may be.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.716
Bevy, I am so sorry.

09:11.718 --> 09:15.186
I know you wanted
this year to be different,

09:15.188 --> 09:16.121
but it turns out

09:16.123 --> 09:19.391
some things
never change!

09:19.393 --> 09:20.926
I'll tell you
what's changed.

09:20.928 --> 09:21.927
I'm never coming
back here again.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.996
MURRAY:
You say that every year,
but you keep showing up!

09:24.998 --> 09:26.932
Yeah, well, this time
I mean it!

09:26.934 --> 09:27.799
I'm gonna call DeLorean's

09:27.801 --> 09:30.669
24-hour concierge
maintenance line,

09:30.671 --> 09:31.803
come fix my car...

09:31.805 --> 09:34.272
And then I am
so out of here!

09:34.607 --> 09:35.941
No! No one's
going anywhere!

09:35.943 --> 09:38.143
The turkey's
out of the oven.
(PICKS UP PHONE)

09:45.018 --> 09:48.753
What the hell?
Aren't they
out of business?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.055
What are you talking about?

09:50.057 --> 09:51.089
It was all over the news.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.858
The owner...John DeLorean...
He was arrested

09:53.860 --> 09:56.995
for trying to sell
two FBI agents

09:56.997 --> 09:58.730
cocaine powder.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.131
What are you
saying to me?

10:00.133 --> 10:03.735
Seriously, the negativity
in this house is unbelievable!

10:03.737 --> 10:04.703
(MOTOR WHIRRING)

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)
Yo! Ad-rock! What's up?

10:08.475 --> 10:10.775
Listen, I've given it
a lot of thought,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.477
and I've decided
to officially acknowledge

10:12.479 --> 10:14.646
that you won
the Barry cup.
The Adam cup.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.182
Sure. Point is,
is I'm being a man

10:17.184 --> 10:17.983
and agreeing that you won.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.619
Now you be a man
and play me in ball-ball

10:20.621 --> 10:21.987
so I can win
the trophy back.

10:21.989 --> 10:24.556
Yeah, here's the thing
about that...

10:24.558 --> 10:25.457
I retired.
What?

10:25.459 --> 10:29.094
I've basically done
all I needed to do
on the ball-ball court,

10:29.096 --> 10:30.996
and now I'm looking
to the future.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.664
You can't retire
as champion.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.765
It makes you
champion forever.

10:33.767 --> 10:37.402
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Ooh, I guess it does.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.071
Fine. I'll beat you
at something else.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.840
Hockey, basketball, darts,

10:41.842 --> 10:44.275
Uno, Clue, Battleship,
arm wrestling,

10:44.277 --> 10:45.710
thumb wrestling,
real wrestling...

10:45.712 --> 10:48.246
Just play me in something
so I can beat you in it!

10:48.248 --> 10:50.782
Are you sure
you can beat me?

10:50.784 --> 10:52.484
Or has the power
dynamic shifted,

10:52.486 --> 10:55.387
and you'll never win
anything ever again?

10:55.389 --> 10:56.321
Are you serious right now?

10:56.323 --> 11:00.225
From now on, you're not
the big brother anymore.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.159
I am.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.595
I will always be
the big brother.

11:03.597 --> 11:05.764
I've grown 2 inches
this year.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.965
How much have you grown?

11:06.967 --> 11:08.199
I don't have
to answer that.

11:08.201 --> 11:11.703
Get your affairs in order,
'cause from now on,

11:11.705 --> 11:13.071
I'm the man.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.340
Now... Leave me to my robot.

I'm so stuffed!

11:24.651 --> 11:26.685
Wait a minute.
Where are you
coming from?

11:26.687 --> 11:28.420
I just ran over
to Lainey's house.

11:28.422 --> 11:31.923
Her mom made the most
amazing feast.

11:32.892 --> 11:33.825
I need to lie down.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.959
Well, you better make
room in your body,

11:34.961 --> 11:38.763
because this
Thanksgiving
is happening.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.366
(INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY)

11:41.368 --> 11:43.568
I gotta be honest
with you, Bev.

11:43.570 --> 11:46.237
I'm taking a lot
of body blows today.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.674
Whole lot of body blows.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.610
Apparently, in addition
to DeLorean discontinuing

11:52.612 --> 11:55.246
their 24-hour
concierge service,

11:55.248 --> 11:57.515
now it's impossible for me
to buy spare parts,

11:57.517 --> 11:59.617
because the company
no longer exists!

11:59.619 --> 12:03.488
Really wish someone
would have told me that
before I bought the car.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.091
Point is,
I'm calling a cab.
(FLIPPING PAGES)

12:06.093 --> 12:07.459
No! No cabs!

12:07.461 --> 12:09.961
I just cut the turkey,
Marvin.

12:09.963 --> 12:10.795
(DIALING)
Come on.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.797
<i>My mom knew her big</i>
<i>Thanksgiving thank-you...</i>

12:12.799 --> 12:13.965
(LINE RINGING)

<i>every ounce of manipulation</i>

12:17.170 --> 12:19.370
<i>and emotional blackmail</i>
<i>in her arsenal</i>

12:19.372 --> 12:22.107

<i>that didn't happen.</i>

12:22.109 --> 12:23.074
<i>She was good cop...</i>

12:23.076 --> 12:24.409
I know you had
a lousy father

12:24.411 --> 12:27.946
and your
childhood with Marvin
was very complicated.

12:27.948 --> 12:31.216
I get it.
I am on your side.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.550
<i>She was bad cop...</i>

12:32.552 --> 12:34.986
I'm getting angry, Marvin.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.921
You won't like me
when I'm angry.

12:36.923 --> 12:37.689
<i>She was guilt cop...</i>

12:37.691 --> 12:39.724
I am this close to
giving up as a wife,

12:39.726 --> 12:41.292
as a mother,
and as a human being.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.529
<i>And finally,</i>
<i>she was the crooked cop</i>
<i>that just plain lied.</i>

12:44.531 --> 12:47.732
You know how prideful
Murray is.

12:47.734 --> 12:48.867
He literally just told me

12:48.869 --> 12:50.602
he wants to invest
in your company,

12:50.604 --> 12:53.037
but he doesn't know
how to say it.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.139
Marvin wants to
just move on

12:54.141 --> 12:57.142
and forget
he ever mentioned
the business to you.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.277
There's no reason to ever
bring it up again.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.747
This is the check from Murray.
He wants you to have it.

13:02.749 --> 13:03.181
But...

13:03.183 --> 13:06.918
He also wants you
to never mention it.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.953
Ever.

13:10.890 --> 13:13.091
<i>My mom had worked her magic,</i>
<i>and for a few minutes,</i>

13:13.093 --> 13:16.194
<i>it was actually like being</i>
<i>at a normal Thanksgiving.</i>

13:16.196 --> 13:18.630
(LAUGHS)
So there we were, okay?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.297
Connie Mack stadium.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.434
Sandy Koufax just
pitched a no-hitter
against our Phillies.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.235
He was unbelievable.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.604
We run down from
the nose-bleed seats.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.772
That's all we could afford.

13:27.774 --> 13:30.041
You kids have no idea
how good you got it.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.944
MARVIN: Sandy is about
to go into the dugout.

13:32.946 --> 13:33.845
Suddenly, he turns around,

13:33.847 --> 13:35.680
he looks at us,
throws me the ball.

13:35.682 --> 13:39.250
No. He threw me the ball,
because I caught it.

13:39.252 --> 13:42.487
(LAUGHS) He clearly
threw it to me,

13:42.489 --> 13:44.889
which is why Dad made you
give me the ball.

13:44.891 --> 13:46.624
Yeah, the greatest
pitcher of all time

13:46.626 --> 13:49.727
from 8 feet away doesn't know
what kid he's throwing to?

13:49.729 --> 13:51.696
Okay. Keeping it positive.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.832
Uh, now's the time
in our dinner

13:53.834 --> 13:55.867
where we're all going to
go around the table

13:55.869 --> 13:59.704
and say what or who
we're most thankful for.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.606
All right?
I'm gonna start.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.141
I'm thankful
to be surrounded

14:03.143 --> 14:07.612
by my beautiful,
loving family. (CHUCKLES)

14:07.680 --> 14:08.246
Erica?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.114
I can't even talk,
I'm so full.

14:10.116 --> 14:10.782
Fine. Barry, go.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.418
I'm thankful for the game
Hungry Hungry Hippos,

14:13.420 --> 14:16.054
which is set up in the den
if anyone wants to play.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.922
I am also thankful
for my family,

14:17.924 --> 14:21.226
which I'll now list
from most to least powerful.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.896
Dad, Pops, Mom, Erica,

14:24.898 --> 14:26.297
me, Uncle Marv,

14:26.299 --> 14:28.032
and of course,
dead last, Barry.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.768
Why are you putting me last?
You can't put me last.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.971
Can't I?
BEVERLY: Okay,
can we stop arguing

14:32.973 --> 14:36.207
and start thanking
someone meaningful?

14:36.209 --> 14:38.142
Someone who's done
a lot for you?

14:38.144 --> 14:40.845
Well, I'm thankful
for a little woman

14:40.847 --> 14:41.946
who's always
been there for me,

14:41.948 --> 14:45.717
not just today,
but throughout the years.

14:45.719 --> 14:46.217
Lady luck.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.221
Without her,
the Cowboys would never
have covered the spread.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.457
You guys really want to know
what I'm thankful for?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.659
Of course.
Come on, don't hold back.

14:54.661 --> 14:58.029
Well, I was
told specifically
not to mention it...

14:58.031 --> 14:59.964
Oh. Oh, boy.
Uh, maybe don't.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.332
Nah, I'm gonna do it.
Or not.

15:01.334 --> 15:04.669
I am thankful
for my big brother,

15:04.671 --> 15:05.904
who believed in me enough

15:05.906 --> 15:07.372
to invest
in my cosmetics venture.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.975
I what now?
Marvin, I thought we weren't
gonna talk about that.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.143
Whoa. Stop right there.

15:12.145 --> 15:14.379
We're investing
money in stuff? I'm in.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.548
Oh! I love you guys.
(LAUGHS)

15:17.550 --> 15:20.251
And...and you're gonna love
Lotions of the Oceans.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.520
Real sea salt. Huh?
(TAPS ON TABLE)

15:22.522 --> 15:23.621
Kelp...second ingredient.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.857
I'm gonna go
get my samples
out of the trunk.

15:25.859 --> 15:27.325
You're gonna love it.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.860
So...

15:29.161 --> 15:32.130
Anyone else
like to give thanks?

15:38.637 --> 15:42.140
Okay, this is our brand-new
face revujenator.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.708
I think it's rejuvenator.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.644
Uh... I think I know
what revujenator is.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.812
I'm the guy
selling the stuff.

15:47.814 --> 15:51.082
I feel younger already.
We're gonna be rich.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.583
I have the cup!
I'm the champion!

15:52.585 --> 15:54.819
That's not how it works!
Give it back!

15:54.821 --> 15:55.920
(LOWERED VOICE)
What were you thinking

15:55.922 --> 15:58.122
giving Marvin money
behind my back?
I'm sorry.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.857
I screwed up.
But for a split second,

15:59.859 --> 16:03.528
I saw you two getting along,
and I know you were happy.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.462
Fine, I was happy!

16:04.464 --> 16:05.496
But that's because
I thought he'd grown up

16:05.498 --> 16:07.865
and I wouldn't have to
take care of him anymore!

16:07.867 --> 16:08.766
Okay! Here you go.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.436
You probably want
to clear some space
out of your garage,

16:11.438 --> 16:12.470
because you're gonna
get a delivery

16:12.472 --> 16:15.206
of about, uh, 20 cases
of this stuff on Monday.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.575
(NORMAL VOICE)
Why would I want
20 cases of that crap?

16:17.577 --> 16:19.410
Because you invested.
Right?

16:19.412 --> 16:20.678
That's...that...
That's the deal.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.747
You...you peddle the creams,
and you recruit more people

16:22.749 --> 16:24.816
to expand
your sales triangle.

16:24.818 --> 16:25.850
Sales triangle?

16:25.852 --> 16:28.353
Wait. Is this a damn
pyramid scheme?

16:28.355 --> 16:31.422
No, no! Th...
There's 26 tiers
of sales, okay?

16:31.424 --> 16:33.458

My car's a bust, I still
live in our parents' house,

17:56.810 --> 17:58.509
and apparently
I'm too stupid to realize

17:58.511 --> 18:01.979
that a triangle is the same
shape as a pyramid.

18:01.981 --> 18:03.047
I don't know,
I just wish that once

18:03.049 --> 18:06.050

you, Murray.
