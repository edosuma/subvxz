WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.073
- I don't remember my name.
- It'll all come back.

00:04.137 --> 00:05.309
You're among friends.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.477
Next on Airwolf.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.857
That girl is alive and
she's out of our control.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.787
Is that to keep them out or to keep me in?

00:19.253 --> 00:22.666
- …is a prostitute. High class.
- That's not true.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.895
We had to take more drastic measures.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.804
My God, you killed her!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

02:12.165 --> 02:13.906
Hey, there's a light back there.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.880
No way. There's not anything
within 40 miles of here.

02:50.437 --> 02:54.044
This is Santini Air. X-ray, Tango, Alpha.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.278
Calling for Fox Ridge. Over, please.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.492
Fox Ridge Medical. Say again. Over.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.754
Now, where did that come from?

03:05.452 --> 03:08.331
Santini Air. X-ray, Tango, Alpha.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.057
I have a medical emergency.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.330
Request medical personnel.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.174
ETA 12 minutes. Over, please.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.606
Roger, X-ray, Tango, Alpha.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.276
What are you do’n? Where are you go’n?

03:22.335 --> 03:24.076
What do you want me to do? Fly up his tail

03:24.137 --> 03:25.878
and take this thing into Fox Ridge

03:25.939 --> 03:29.250
and let everybody see what
kind of bird we're flying?

03:29.676 --> 03:32.282
Mr. Rossiter's going to
raise hell about this.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.525
Yeah Dom, you're there?

03:42.589 --> 03:46.127
Well yes, I'm here, Cate's here.

03:46.359 --> 03:48.430
We've been here since 6:00.

03:48.795 --> 03:52.368
We were supposed to overhaul
the 206 today, you remember?

03:52.766 --> 03:55.975
The question is, where are you?

03:56.536 --> 03:59.016
Well, I'm sorry, I'm gonna
be hung up for a while.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.183
There goes another sawbuck,

04:02.242 --> 04:05.712
because Cate bet me that you'd
be at least an hour late!

04:06.046 --> 04:08.754
Doctor Ellis, please
report to the nurse's station.

04:09.282 --> 04:12.491
Hey, String, are you in
a hospital? Are you…

04:12.552 --> 04:14.259
Yeah, it is. I'm okay though.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.031
I flew in a medical casualty.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.937
Oh, well, listen, I didn't
mean to bite your head off.

04:20.994 --> 04:22.064
Forget it.

04:22.596 --> 04:27.204
Hey Dom, listen, I ran into a real
strange silhouette last night.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.471
It was a chopper with
a gunship configuration.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.876
Kind of like the A-10. You got
anything like that, that rings a bell?

04:33.940 --> 04:35.715
No, not offhand.

04:35.909 --> 04:39.118
Mr. Hawke, Doctor Forrester
would like to see you.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.389
Listen Dom, just check
on it for me, will you?

04:42.449 --> 04:45.191
Yeah, sure. I'll check out
the journals and ask around.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.229
But listen, you need any help there?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.790
No, I'll be along as quick as I can.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.535
What are you saying? She's alive?

04:57.597 --> 05:00.874
No. She's probably dead.
What do you mean "probably?”

05:01.101 --> 05:04.048
We just haven't been
able to verify her death.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.278
Did that pilot get a look at the A-16?

05:09.342 --> 05:12.414
No sir, we were running
blacked out on full stealth mode.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.356
You see, what we have to do, Mr. Rossiter,

05:14.414 --> 05:18.021
is go to the hospital and make
sure she was dead on arrival.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.427
Well, that's a good idea, Steele.

05:19.486 --> 05:22.296
Because if I give the Senator
any “probably’s” or “maybe’s”,

05:22.355 --> 05:24.733
he is gonna pull the plug on this deal.

05:24.791 --> 05:28.398
Mr. Rossiter, now don't worry about that.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.599
I will take care of it.

05:29.663 --> 05:32.974
All you have to do is sit back and relax

05:33.366 --> 05:36.176
and wait for that billion-dollar contract.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.558
- Where'd you say this happened?
- I didn't.

05:56.223 --> 05:59.670
- You do remember when?
- Yeah, about 3 hours ago.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.875
The lady's damn lucky to be alive.

06:05.932 --> 06:08.469
I had to run an extra set
of plates to believe it.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.539
Outside of a scalp
laceration and contusions…

06:13.273 --> 06:16.482
- Is she going to be all right?
- Let me see your arm.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.488
- For what?
- We are not virgins here, Mr. Hawke.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.889
You're not the first to bring in a victim,

06:20.947 --> 06:23.223
no name, obscure facts as to what happened.

06:23.283 --> 06:24.523
Generally, it's a skiing accident.

06:24.584 --> 06:27.258
Nothing so fanciful a story as yours.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.392
Just exactly what are you look’n for?

06:30.457 --> 06:31.993
Girl's got an armful of tracks.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.538
I was hoping you could tell me what
kind of drugs she'd been taking.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.598
It'll take time to run
a complete blood panel.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.610
You know Doc, I told your
nurse, now I'm tell’n you.

06:41.735 --> 06:45.740
I don't know this lady. She
fell in a lake. I found her.

06:46.439 --> 06:50.854
Fell? How far? 50 feet, 100?

06:51.044 --> 06:53.490
I figure you got a coupla choices.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.885
You can call the cops

06:54.948 --> 06:58.225
and have them come here track’n
up your sterile environment,

06:58.285 --> 07:01.289
or you can just wait
and ask the lady herself.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.163
That might be a while.

07:03.390 --> 07:06.701
She's acutely disoriented
with considerable amnesia.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.598
Of course, that's not unusual
in cases of severe trauma.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.169
Perhaps you should talk to her.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.913
She's never even laid eyes on me before.

07:18.972 --> 07:22.442
I wouldn't be so sure. She was
semi-conscious when she arrived.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.546
You could be very helpful.

07:26.813 --> 07:28.349
Well, if you're sure, yeah.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.670
Be careful, she's very unstable.

07:41.995 --> 07:45.533
She's been drifting in and out. But
she might recognize your voice.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.538
What do I say to her?

07:47.600 --> 07:49.705
Anything. Try hello.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.447
Hello.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.017
You don't know me. As a matter
of fact, I don't know you.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.762
But we'd really like to talk with you.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.195
You're among friends.

08:08.388 --> 08:11.198
You. I know you.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.299
He saved your life.

08:15.762 --> 08:20.302
This is Doctor Forrester.
My name is Hawke. How about you?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.271
Think it's time we got introduced?

08:24.304 --> 08:27.877
I don't know. I don't remember my name.

08:28.008 --> 08:32.457
It's gonna be all right. It'll all
come back. Just don't concern yourself.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.793
It's gonna be okay.

08:41.488 --> 08:45.595
I have a friend who'll
help you. You just rest.

08:48.128 --> 08:51.803
Rest. I'll be back.

08:56.302 --> 08:59.511
You'll be all right.
Everything will be all right.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.124
She seems to trust you.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.760
That puts her one up on you, Doc.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.956
- You gonna call the police now?
- When I'm ready.

09:15.021 --> 09:16.830
I'm a country Doctor, Mr. Hawke.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.666
I like to see my patients on their
feet before I lay stress on ‘em.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.763
- You really don't know who she is?
- No.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.307
I could find out.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.173
All we have is the peignoir and
her blood type, B-positive.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.303
7% group, not much.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.109
If I send her fingerprints to the Sheriff,

09:30.170 --> 09:32.411
he's going to want to know why.

09:33.073 --> 09:36.714
I've got friends Doc, who can
take care of that privately.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.316
All right. I'll have Hilda
take the fingerprints.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.554
As soon as Radiology's free,
we'll run some dental X-rays.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.152
That could help, too. Excuse me.

09:45.218 --> 09:47.630
I appreciate it, Doc.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.780
These aren't my specialty,
but I think they'll do.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.722
They look pretty good.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.527
Ever think of joining the Police
Academy? You missed your calling.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.531
I'll take that recommendation in
writing when I ask for a raise.

10:20.587 --> 10:21.759
Oh, hold on.

10:21.821 --> 10:24.199
If you're taking her to
Physiotherapy, there's a chill in there.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.895
You take my coat.

10:25.992 --> 10:27.596
Are you leaving?

10:29.362 --> 10:33.139
Yeah. Just for a little bit. I'll be back.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.407
Promise.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.408
Keep her warm.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.192
So, how may I help you?

10:53.019 --> 10:56.899
We heard that a pilot flew my
friend's niece in here this morning.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.161
Yeah. I just wanted to
know if she was okay.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.332
In that case you won't
mind telling me her name.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.971
What name did she use?

11:06.799 --> 11:10.178
You won't object if I ask
you for some identification?

11:10.970 --> 11:15.783
Look, the girl's in a bit of
trouble. Just let us see her.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.983
We really don't want to get the
family name involved in this.

11:20.046 --> 11:23.027
Either you show me some
identification or the Police.

11:23.082 --> 11:25.084
Either way, I don't care.

11:29.556 --> 11:31.593
This is my identification.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.301
Would you please tell us her room number?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.105
Put that away, this is a hospital.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.609
Well, if you are going to get shot,

11:39.666 --> 11:42.510
a hospital is the place to do it, isn't it?

11:56.482 --> 11:58.428
Get in there! In there!

11:58.785 --> 12:01.698
What room is she in? The
last door on the left.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.795
Come on, I'll explain later.

12:32.652 --> 12:35.292
Let's go. Don't!

12:49.202 --> 12:50.374
It'd be a big help

12:50.436 --> 12:53.383
if you could tell me
anything about yourself.

12:53.439 --> 12:56.909
I can't be certain. But those
men, I think I know them.

12:57.877 --> 13:00.483
You got a name? Just one name?

13:03.049 --> 13:06.121
I'm sorry. There are
flashes, bits and pieces.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.661
But I can't hold onto anything.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.002
- Probably the drugs.
- Drugs?

13:15.361 --> 13:16.965
Check your arms.

13:25.171 --> 13:28.243
I don't know how, but
I know I didn't do this!

13:28.641 --> 13:29.881
I didn't!

13:30.410 --> 13:32.083
Just take it easy.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.889
Let's try someth’n, maybe
we can find out who you are.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.392
Can you type?

13:36.449 --> 13:38.554
Yes, I'm a very good typist.

13:38.618 --> 13:41.224
You see, it just started to come back.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.461
Close your eyes, imagine
you're typing your name.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.404
It's just not there.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.777
It's like my parents… the faces…

13:54.834 --> 13:57.144
I just can't focus through the haze.

13:57.203 --> 14:01.049
How about this? Remember anything
about this? Bring back anything?

14:01.107 --> 14:04.020
It's what you were wearing when I found you.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.857
I wouldn't buy this. I couldn't afford it.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.619
Think about it.

14:12.352 --> 14:16.892
It could have been a gift. It
does have a real exclusive label.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.503
No, it's wrong for me…

14:26.666 --> 14:28.270
The large man…

14:30.136 --> 14:32.116
The large man at the hospital.

14:32.171 --> 14:33.707
What about him?

14:33.773 --> 14:36.083
I keep seeing him with a needle.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.820
Is he the one that gave you the drugs?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.519
Yeah, I think so.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.792
- But there is… there is something else.
- What?

14:51.724 --> 14:54.864
Steele. His name is Steele.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.563
Steele. Good.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.485
Lunch! You made good time.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.656
Yeah, maybe too good. I've got a
couple of cops right behind me.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.697
- 2? What the hell did you do?
- Nothing.

15:20.853 --> 15:23.800
Dom, Cate, this is Hawke. Over.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.795
Listen, String, I've got a couple of
black and whites on the doorstep.

15:28.861 --> 15:29.965
Make it fast.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.976
Yeah Dom, they're
look’n for me. Sandbag ‘em.

15:33.032 --> 15:35.012
I'm heading for Rancho Springs.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.913
Call Archangel and ask him to
check me in at the El Dorado Spa.

15:40.673 --> 15:44.086
Come off it, Steele. I'm
sick of your re-assurance.

15:44.143 --> 15:47.215
That girl is alive and
she's out of our control.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.261
You said you could erase her memory
with drugs, but it failed, didn't it?

15:50.316 --> 15:52.353
If I’d have had the time,
it would have worked.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.227
But it didn't work!

15:54.353 --> 15:57.425
Sir, the helicopter had a name on the side.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.329
Santini Air.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.400
I'm going over there
and see what I can turn up.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.907
Well, I'm sure, Mr. Rossiter,

16:05.965 --> 16:08.002
that you can clear any background checks

16:08.067 --> 16:10.104
with the Senator, can't you?

16:10.169 --> 16:13.013
Senator Houston is flying in here tomorrow.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.745
I have to assure him that
that girl is no threat.

16:16.809 --> 16:21.622
Now you get what you need, whatever
you need. Just make sure it works.

16:24.417 --> 16:27.694
He wants me to show up there,
and you have no idea why?

16:27.753 --> 16:29.892
You know as much about this as I do.

16:30.223 --> 16:34.000
But String wouldn't ask for it
unless he… unless it was important.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.097
So, will you do it? Please?

16:40.032 --> 16:42.740
Asks more questions than a Census taker.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.815
Hi, looking for the boss.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.747
Well, I'm the boss.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.917
Dominic Santini.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.186
Hi. My name is Barnes
and this is Mr. Rogers.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.025
How are you?

16:56.115 --> 16:59.892
I hear you got a beautiful red,
white and blue helicopter here.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.091
Oh! That's my pride and joy.

17:02.788 --> 17:04.926
But it's not here right now.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.938
Is there anything I can do to help you?

17:07.993 --> 17:10.372
We shoot commercials.

17:10.429 --> 17:13.501
And we are always looking
for unusual aircraft.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.878
I'll tell you what else.

17:15.935 --> 17:18.472
I hear you got a fellow here,
can make that helicopter

17:18.538 --> 17:20.575
do everything but double back flips.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.848
Stringfellow Hawke. He's the best there is.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.221
I don't suppose you could let me
know where I could find this fellow.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.318
Tell me where his water’n
hole is, where he lives…

17:30.383 --> 17:33.227
No, I'm sorry, I never give
out that kind of information.

17:33.286 --> 17:36.756
But if you tell me what kind
of stunt you have in mind,

17:36.856 --> 17:38.665
maybe I can help you.

17:42.261 --> 17:46.175
To tell you the truth, I just
wanted to pick his brains,

17:46.666 --> 17:50.273
take someth’n back to wow ‘em
with, you know what I mean?

17:50.336 --> 17:52.213
Oh well, I'll just figure
it out on the airplane

17:52.271 --> 17:54.273
and see if it works, huh?

17:54.373 --> 17:57.149
I want to thank you. Maybe
we'll do business again.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.711
We'll be here.

18:25.504 --> 18:28.246
You get any kinda feelings?

18:30.309 --> 18:32.550
I'm sorry, I don't remember it.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.292
Excuse me, may I help you?

18:36.482 --> 18:39.861
Yes. The lady’d like to
see some of your clothing.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.099
Are you certain that
you have the right shop?

18:44.757 --> 18:47.966
No. You see anything here that
kind of tickles your fancy?

18:48.227 --> 18:51.037
Yeah, I think I could find someth’n here.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.537
This oughta take care of it.

18:53.899 --> 18:55.071
Francine.

18:55.134 --> 18:59.412
Francine, would you show this young
lady our junior collection, please?

19:02.908 --> 19:06.185
I guess you have quite
an exclusive shop here.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.253
Yes, we sell only one of a kind of apparel.

19:09.315 --> 19:12.626
“Country Elegance” is the
ultimate in women's fashions.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.259
Really? And you stand behind your product?

19:21.193 --> 19:24.606
- I'd like to return this.
- That has been worn.

19:25.264 --> 19:28.711
Yeah, it looked like that to me, too.
That's why I brought it back.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.207
Do you have your sales slip?

19:33.239 --> 19:36.220
Well, it's one of a kind.
You must have a record.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.482
It does have your label in it.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.954
Excuse me.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.903
Well, what do you think?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.602
Looks great. I think you need some shoes.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.811
- Yes, I got it right here.
- I think you're right.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.312
It was a cash payment.

20:03.369 --> 20:07.408
10945 Oakmont Terrace, apartment 109.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.922
You're sure about that?

20:13.979 --> 20:16.186
It was the 16th of last month.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.919
And I assure you

20:17.983 --> 20:22.056
that this garment was not in this
condition when it left our store.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.794
Listen.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.866
Give me the name,

20:26.926 --> 20:30.567
and I'll get outta here and
stop clashing with your decor.

20:32.131 --> 20:35.044
Maxwell. Lila Maxwell.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.844
Well, you look great.

20:40.906 --> 20:44.012
At least I feel a little
more like a human being.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.282
Thanks.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.420
I'll pay you back.

20:50.282 --> 20:52.523
That won't be necessary, Lila.

20:53.619 --> 20:54.893
Lila?

20:55.321 --> 20:57.995
I got a name, Lila Maxwell.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.302
Honestly, I just don't feel like a Lila.

21:05.631 --> 21:09.272
Then of course, Stringfellow
just doesn't fit you, either.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.812
I'll tell you what.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.854
Let's go see what Lila
Maxwell does feel like.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.274
What now? No keys.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.581
How did you do that?

21:55.781 --> 21:58.022
Well, this ring any bells?

22:01.453 --> 22:02.989
Nothing so far.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.168
Go have a look around.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.313
What is it?

22:53.505 --> 22:55.178
This is my makeup.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.983
These are my things.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.952
This is my perfume.

23:02.948 --> 23:05.087
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

23:05.150 --> 23:09.064
I don't know why I'm sure. This closet…

23:10.389 --> 23:12.596
All these dresses are my size.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.931
But there are only 2 of
them I have ever worn. These.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.444
These others do look a little flashy.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.818
There's something so wrong here.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.689
I know I have never been in this apartment.

23:37.716 --> 23:42.165
I would know. I'm certain I would know.

23:50.496 --> 23:55.241
It's as if someone has stolen my
life away and won't let me back in.

24:03.575 --> 24:06.351
Hey, we'll find it again.

24:10.749 --> 24:14.720
There's just no guarantee that
you're going to like what you find.

24:16.188 --> 24:19.726
I'll handle it. I promise.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.839
Just don't desert me.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.677
You're the only reality I have.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.713
After all we've been through,

24:38.010 --> 24:42.220
I couldn't leave unless I was
able to find out your name.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.641
Don't make any trouble, ace.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.527
Go, go, go!

26:04.763 --> 26:07.300
Dominic says there's a girl
and a gunship involved.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.471
You want to give me a clue?

26:16.508 --> 26:18.454
What's this? Fingerprints?

26:18.510 --> 26:21.855
Yeah, and a name. Or at least, maybe a name.

26:23.182 --> 26:26.356
Lila Maxwell. Run it
through the computer for me.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.254
This is it? Nothing else?

26:35.661 --> 26:38.835
Some kind of mind control
drugs, as far as I know.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.371
Check ‘em out.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.038
I'll have my people work on
this all night if necessary,

26:43.102 --> 26:45.241
but I want you and that girl in my office

26:45.304 --> 26:47.614
tomorrow morning at 10:00. Deal?

26:47.806 --> 26:50.650
Yeah. 10:00. Yeah, Michael.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.466
You here?

27:08.627 --> 27:10.732
Hope you like Chinese food.

27:10.863 --> 27:13.571
I love it. At least, I think I do.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.646
It's all that was open.

27:25.344 --> 27:28.188
Is that to keep them out or to keep me in?

27:31.817 --> 27:34.764
I was hoping I only had to
fight one side at a time.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.801
You know, while you were
out, I've been thinking.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.564
Who… whatever it turns out I am,

27:41.293 --> 27:44.467
I don't want anything
to be different between us.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.212
I doubt if it could.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.746
Nice to see you, Senator.

27:57.809 --> 28:00.289
So, what's happening with the girl?

28:00.946 --> 28:02.948
She's been taken care of.

28:03.482 --> 28:06.622
Oh, thank God, when I think how
much damage she could have done.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.029
Yes, I saw the picture in the paper.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.089
Capitol Hill Family of the Year.

28:11.156 --> 28:14.899
Rising young politician,
beautiful wife, cute kids.

28:15.327 --> 28:18.137
You know, the only person missing
in that picture was that mistress.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.938
All right, look, I hate that word.

28:19.998 --> 28:22.569
It wasn't at all like that. It was…

28:23.168 --> 28:24.579
it was more.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.507
But not the kind of thing you want
to talk about on the campaign trail.

28:28.574 --> 28:30.053
It just seems strange

28:30.108 --> 28:33.453
that she doesn't remember
any of it now, not even me.

28:33.845 --> 28:37.122
You actually purged the
whole thing from her memory?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.527
No, it turns out there was
a hitch in that procedure.

28:40.686 --> 28:43.292
You said she'd been taken care of.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.960
We had to take more drastic measures.

28:47.693 --> 28:49.331
My God, you killed her!

28:49.394 --> 28:52.102
It's not what I wanted to
happen, either, Senator.

28:52.164 --> 28:55.907
But it had to happen if we're
both to accomplish our goals.

28:56.201 --> 28:57.407
I have secret contracts

28:57.469 --> 29:00.040
with half a dozen
foreign powers for that A-16.

29:00.105 --> 29:04.076
I don't give a damn about
your contracts! You had no right.

29:04.176 --> 29:07.385
All right, Senator. Let's
cut it. Let's get down to it.

29:07.446 --> 29:11.019
Now that A-16 is the finest
fighting helicopter in the world.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.118
5 of them,

29:12.184 --> 29:15.165
just 5, will pay for
your Presidential campaign.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.325
10's gonna win it for you.

29:17.856 --> 29:20.666
Now, you tell me I was wrong in what I did.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.772
Tell me you're gonna
give up the White House,

29:22.828 --> 29:25.832
your whole political
career for that one girl.

29:26.898 --> 29:30.539
Are you prepared to do that?
Now, you think about it.

29:38.343 --> 29:41.483
- Michael, did you get anything?
- Yes.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.123
But I don't think you're gonna like it,

29:44.182 --> 29:45.957
neither will the young lady.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.020
- We'll handle it.
- Go ahead.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.101
The lady's fingerprints are definitive.

29:59.231 --> 30:03.145
I have a record of arrests in San
Francisco, New York and Atlanta.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.441
All dismissed, apparently,

30:04.503 --> 30:07.109
by the intervention of
someone with a lot of clout.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.947
Care to take a look?

30:15.681 --> 30:17.354
Arrested for what?

30:21.253 --> 30:23.460
I hate to tell you this,

30:23.522 --> 30:25.229
but the lady is a prostitute.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.828
High class, but Lila Maxwell is a hooker.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.836
That's not true. I'm not…

30:33.332 --> 30:35.141
You just take it easy.

30:35.200 --> 30:39.273
What’ve they got in that file
there about somebody named Steele?

30:39.705 --> 30:40.911
Lydia?

30:43.575 --> 30:45.577
No record on Steele, sir.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.754
What kind of a priority does this list have?

30:47.813 --> 30:48.951
I mean, who has access to it?

30:49.014 --> 30:50.049
Top clearance.

30:50.115 --> 30:52.186
Access limited to ranking
members of the Pentagon,

30:52.250 --> 30:54.696
Congress and other need-to-know people.

30:54.753 --> 30:58.929
So, these need-to-know
people can just take a lady

30:59.858 --> 31:02.202
and send her memory out to lunch?

31:02.861 --> 31:06.399
So, she takes over the
identity of some overdosed hooker.

31:07.766 --> 31:10.713
- Oh, that's fantasy.
- It's been done before.

31:11.103 --> 31:12.138
Drugs?

31:12.204 --> 31:15.981
Tryptamine, LSD 25 and 3
others I've barely heard of.

31:17.008 --> 31:20.080
They're control drugs,
right, all brainwashing?

31:20.846 --> 31:21.847
Yes.

31:21.913 --> 31:24.792
However, the effects
are sometimes reversible.

31:24.850 --> 31:28.297
But I must tell you that the
procedure can be dangerous.

31:28.353 --> 31:30.355
I'm willing to risk that.

31:31.356 --> 31:33.859
Like finding out about Lila Maxwell,

31:35.594 --> 31:37.596
that has its dangers, too.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.874
Only if you believe it.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.414
Lydia, get me Dr. Johnson, please.

32:04.456 --> 32:09.201
They use even stronger drugs to unblock
the synapses in the brain. It's tricky.

32:09.628 --> 32:13.098
Sometimes the receptors won't
return to normal function.

32:13.999 --> 32:17.811
So, you're saying that she might
have permanent brain damage?

32:20.806 --> 32:22.717
What are the chances?

32:23.341 --> 32:26.550
Depends on how long she was on the drugs.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.091
Near as I can tell, about 6 weeks.

32:33.218 --> 32:34.959
That's a long time.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.669
How is she? Very good. She
came through it well.

32:49.734 --> 32:50.974
I have a name for you.

32:51.036 --> 32:53.414
Dawn. Dawn Jenene Harrison.

32:53.472 --> 32:56.419
Staff Assistant with
the Commerce Department.

32:56.541 --> 32:59.715
- That's it?
- No, but some of it gets
rather complicated.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.224
It seems she was
involved with Senator Houston.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.987
Terrible anxiety about it.

33:04.049 --> 33:07.258
No wonder. He's
Mr. Squeaky Clean. Real family man.

33:08.253 --> 33:11.962
Also, she's very upset about his
relationship with a man named Rossiter.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.297
Rossiter?

33:13.525 --> 33:15.562
He's Rossair International.

33:15.627 --> 33:19.700
The body they fished out of that
pool was a consultant to Rossiter.

33:21.066 --> 33:24.411
Consultant, my foot. He's gun muscle.

33:24.569 --> 33:27.049
She has great fear of a man named Steele.

33:27.105 --> 33:29.415
Apparently, he administered the drugs.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.715
And those are the main highlights.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.223
How soon can I see her?

33:35.280 --> 33:36.759
She's already coming out of it,

33:36.815 --> 33:39.159
so she'll be fine in about a half an hour.

33:39.217 --> 33:41.424
Good, that'll give us
time to check this out.

33:41.486 --> 33:43.159
Thank you, Doctor.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.708
Well, that's it.

33:58.770 --> 34:01.683
The whole Lila Maxwell
dossier was manufactured

34:01.740 --> 34:03.617
by splicing most of Dawn's past

34:03.675 --> 34:06.554
with fictitious records
from the past 2 years.

34:06.611 --> 34:09.717
The prostitution arrests, the
apartment, the clothing receipts…

34:09.781 --> 34:13.251
And they just swapped fingerprint files.

34:14.652 --> 34:17.690
Lila's for Dawn's and Dawn's for Lila's.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.632
So, when Dawn tried to find her past,

34:19.690 --> 34:21.830
the Staff Assistant became Lila Maxwell,

34:21.893 --> 34:23.998
hooker with a drug problem?

34:24.195 --> 34:25.868
Boy, that's scary.

34:25.964 --> 34:28.603
Changing a person's whole life that way.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.973
Took someone very powerful with access.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.507
There's only one person it could be.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.610
Senator Houston.

34:37.742 --> 34:41.451
Here's something interesting from
this morning's security briefing.

34:41.513 --> 34:44.585
Senator Houston arriving
this a.m. by private jet,

34:44.649 --> 34:46.822
landing at Rossair International

34:46.885 --> 34:48.795
for low profile inspection tour.

34:48.853 --> 34:50.525
No media coverage.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.732
So, they got the whole tribe gathered now.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.011
But what are they up to?

35:04.369 --> 35:07.213
I don't know. I'm going to talk to Dawn.

35:17.716 --> 35:18.820
Dawn?

35:22.087 --> 35:24.226
Dawn's an awful pretty name.

35:31.029 --> 35:35.205
String, I didn't realize
I cared for someone else.

35:39.504 --> 35:41.643
We knew there'd be surprises.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.619
I almost wish I were Lila Maxwell.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.855
Might have been easier.

35:52.283 --> 35:55.230
Or that I didn't remember the good.

35:56.554 --> 35:58.966
It was good between Steven and me.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.095
I felt privileged to share his life.

36:04.262 --> 36:06.401
He was headed for greatness.

36:07.532 --> 36:09.409
What changed all that?

36:12.003 --> 36:15.450
I overheard him selling out
his position in the Senate.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.519
He's going to make it possible for Rossiter

36:18.576 --> 36:21.682
to sell our latest
weapons to terrorist killers.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.161
The gunships?

36:27.485 --> 36:29.556
Yeah. And do you know why?

36:33.191 --> 36:35.467
Money… money is power,

36:37.262 --> 36:39.242
it's an ancient disease.

36:40.398 --> 36:43.379
He thinks Rossiter can
buy him the Presidency.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.474
Dawn, I'm gonna ask someth’n of you.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.779
Please don't take me wrong.

36:53.645 --> 36:55.318
Help us stop ‘em.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.855
Yes.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.142
Dom, this is Hawke.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.007
We're going in. Ya’ll set?

37:49.067 --> 37:51.138
Roger, I'm camped in the backyard.

37:51.202 --> 37:54.115
Good. Better monitor the Firm's
walkie-talkie frequencies.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.651
Got ya, out.

38:07.552 --> 38:09.793
Get that chopper ready to fly!

38:20.532 --> 38:23.103
Yes. All right, put him on.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.046
Mr. Steele, what is it?

38:27.105 --> 38:28.209
What?

38:29.507 --> 38:31.509
No. You stay right there.

38:33.211 --> 38:34.952
I'll call you back.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.787
Is something wrong?

38:36.981 --> 38:40.622
No, nothing major. Just a
little security problem.

38:46.724 --> 38:49.933
What is it? Tell him I'm unavailable.

38:53.264 --> 38:56.006
I'm afraid I must insist. Hello, Senator.

38:56.601 --> 38:59.548
I'm Michael Coldsmith Briggs from the Firm.

39:01.105 --> 39:03.551
What is this, Rossiter?
What's going on here?

39:03.608 --> 39:07.055
I can assure you Senator, this
is as much a mystery to me.

39:07.245 --> 39:09.987
I have someone to meet you 2 gentlemen.

39:10.114 --> 39:11.286
Hawke?

39:15.086 --> 39:18.693
Oh, my God! Dawn, you're alive.

39:19.624 --> 39:23.037
Yes, Steven, and I even
answer to my own name.

39:24.095 --> 39:26.302
No thanks to your friend here.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.942
He did his damnedest to kill her.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.274
That's a totally unfounded accusation.

39:31.336 --> 39:34.977
Mr. Rossiter, I'm here to
impound the A-16 prototype.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.742
We have eyewitness testimony

39:36.808 --> 39:38.810
that it was used in the
commission of a felony.

39:38.877 --> 39:42.689
I am also going to seek indictments
against you and the Senator

39:42.747 --> 39:47.218
for conspiring to export classified
technology to unfriendly powers.

39:48.953 --> 39:50.125
I see.

39:51.089 --> 39:54.559
I think I should have my
Chief Attorney join us in here.

39:56.361 --> 39:58.034
Yes, this is Rossiter.

39:58.096 --> 40:01.873
Would you tell Mr. Lyman to join
me in my office at once, please.

40:01.933 --> 40:02.968
Thank you.

40:06.604 --> 40:08.481
Did you do it, Steven?

40:08.840 --> 40:10.979
Did you tell them to kill me?

40:11.843 --> 40:12.844
No, I just…

40:12.911 --> 40:15.983
I swear to God that was
never part of the plan.

40:16.614 --> 40:19.254
But you told them to give me the drugs.

40:20.285 --> 40:22.356
They told me that they
could make you forget

40:22.420 --> 40:24.923
the conversation that you overheard.

40:25.456 --> 40:27.231
And forget about me.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.940
Is that what you wanted?

40:34.132 --> 40:35.202
Yes.

40:39.203 --> 40:41.205
That will be Mr. Lyman.

40:41.372 --> 40:42.612
Come in.

40:43.708 --> 40:44.743
Hi.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.619
Everybody just relax.

40:48.546 --> 40:51.026
Phillips, you keep your eye on these people.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.255
Rossiter, you must be insane.

40:53.318 --> 40:54.558
Shut up.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.393
Rossiter, Senator,

40:58.389 --> 41:00.164
we have one chance of getting outta here

41:00.224 --> 41:01.794
and it's sitting on the tarmac.

41:01.859 --> 41:02.894
Senator, come on.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.805
No, no, it's over. I'm staying here.

41:06.831 --> 41:09.107
Well, you suit yourself, Senator.

41:09.167 --> 41:10.942
Now Phillips, you keep
your eye on these people

41:11.002 --> 41:13.482
till we can send some help for you.

41:14.906 --> 41:17.386
Phillips, your boss is a crook.

41:17.976 --> 41:20.286
They tried to murder this woman.

41:20.378 --> 41:22.619
Quiet, stand easy like he said.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.854
Hawke, he's going to kill us.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.328
I know he is going to kill us.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.659
I know…

41:32.123 --> 41:34.467
Red alert. Zebra Squad, Code 1.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.270
Somebody call Dom. Tell him to pick me up.

41:46.371 --> 41:49.147
Get them! Stop them! Let's stop ‘em.

42:18.136 --> 42:21.413
Steele and Rossiter are
turning south-east. Heading 115.

42:21.472 --> 42:22.644
Roger.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.691
Turbo's on the line, String.

42:52.937 --> 42:54.473
Visual contact.

42:58.476 --> 43:01.184
This is Hawke, give it up and follow me.

43:14.725 --> 43:16.534
He's good. Darn good.

43:23.801 --> 43:26.543
- Sunburst twice, Dom,
- Sunburst, 2 times.

43:44.489 --> 43:46.992
You're hot Ace, but not hot enough.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.646
- Maverick, Dom,
- Maverick.

44:14.185 --> 44:16.165
Okay Dom, let's go home.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.875
Well, I just couldn't leave for Washington

44:28.933 --> 44:31.379
without coming by, to
thank all of you again.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.472
You know, I still have a job there

44:33.538 --> 44:36.109
and now that all the indictments
have been handed down,

44:36.174 --> 44:40.122
Steven, Senator Houston, will
be submitting his resignation.

44:41.279 --> 44:44.283
It's going to be a very
difficult time for him.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.690
You plan on seeing him again?

44:47.818 --> 44:48.853
No.

44:50.087 --> 44:52.226
He's really not a bad person.

44:52.957 --> 44:55.335
I don't know why I keep defending him.

44:55.393 --> 44:57.168
It doesn't make any sense.

44:57.228 --> 44:58.571
You can say that again.

44:58.629 --> 45:01.974
Well, I think it does. I wish
you all the luck in the world.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.239
Thanks.

45:04.569 --> 45:05.707
Guess we better get on the road

45:05.770 --> 45:08.250
if we're going to make your plane, huh?

45:15.413 --> 45:17.188
I must be nuts, huh?

45:18.082 --> 45:20.392
Kind of goes with the territory.

45:20.785 --> 45:23.789
Listen though, if you're
ever in the neighborhood…

45:24.689 --> 45:27.192
Right, I'll drop in on you again, huh?
