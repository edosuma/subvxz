# When I wake up,
well, I know I'm gonna be

00:33.784 --> 00:37.412
# I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you

00:37.621 --> 00:40.874
# When I go out,

00:40.958 --> 00:44.086
# I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

00:44.837 --> 00:48.173

00:48.382 --> 00:51.802

00:51.927 --> 00:55.347

# I'm gonna be the man

00:59.643 --> 01:02.855
# But I would walk five hundred miles

01:02.980 --> 01:06.608
# And I would walk five hundred more

01:06.733 --> 01:11.113
# Just to be the man
who walked a thousand miles

01:11.321 --> 01:14.032
# To fall down at your door

01:32.176 --> 01:35.512
# When I'm lonely,
well, I know I'm gonna be

01:35.721 --> 01:39.141
# I'm gonna be the man
who's lonely without you

01:39.349 --> 01:42.686
# And when I'm dreamin',
well, I know I'm gonna dream

01:42.895 --> 01:46.356

01:57.492 --> 02:01.038
# I'm gonna be the man

# I'm gonna be the man

# But I would walk five hundred miles

02:15.010 --> 02:19.389
# Just to be the man

02:19.515 --> 02:22.226
# To fall down at your door

02:37.115 --> 02:40.244
# And I would walk five hundred miles

02:40.452 --> 02:43.997
# And I would walk five hundred more

02:44.122 --> 02:48.502
# Just to be the man
who walked a thousand miles

02:48.585 --> 02:53.799
# To fall down at your door

02:55.175 --> 02:59.221
So we're planning our next vacation.
I want Australia, she wants ltaly.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.183
I like snorkelling. She likes garlic.

03:03.392 --> 03:07.563
All of a sudden, out of nowhere,
she says to me: do I need her?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.316
Jesus, Benny.
What kind of a question is that?

03:11.441 --> 03:14.778
Need? What does it really mean
to need somebody?

03:14.987 --> 03:17.072
Benny, fuel line.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.909
Waldo, could you answer that phone?

03:22.995 --> 03:25.914
- Hello.
- I need a cheque, Benny. COD.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.333
In a minute. Meet me in the office.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.502
All right.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.755
Whoa! Put that out! I got a fuel line broke.

03:33.839 --> 03:39.678
- Hey, Benny. Joon's on the phone again.
- I'll call back. Find out what she wants.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.972
It's an emergency.

03:42.097 --> 03:45.851
She says you're runnin' low
on Peanut Butter Super Chunks.

03:47.311 --> 03:49.271
An emergency...

03:54.193 --> 03:57.738
The issue is jelly. You only like two kinds.

04:00.115 --> 04:03.994
You either like grape or boysenberry.
Which is it? All right.

04:04.203 --> 04:09.499
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peanut butter. I know.
Super Crunch. I'll see you at six, OK? Bye.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.170
Thanks for waitin', ma'am.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.507
I'm afraid the best
we can do for you is gonna be...

04:18.257 --> 04:23.263
It's gonna be $750. If you check around,
you'll see that that is a really good deal.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.391
- Yeah?
- That is a really very good deal, ma'am.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.853
A little too good.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.899
Let's do it.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.333
Come here. Come here.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.597
You're not doing your job!
What is your job, anyway?

05:05.806 --> 05:08.308
To clean this house, but not any more!

05:08.433 --> 05:12.187
- Get out of my sight!
- You wouldn't dare, Joon!

05:14.565 --> 05:16.984
What is going on here? Joon?

05:17.067 --> 05:19.987
Mrs Smail, please, let me explain.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.906
Beware, the winds of reason
shall blow stern.

05:23.115 --> 05:25.117
- What?
- I'm done, Mr Pearl.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.494
I'm done! The mule's turned to glue!

05:27.619 --> 05:31.039
She wanders off unescorted.
She has sudden outbursts.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.250
She's simply unmanageable.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.795
Mrs Smail, wait. Please, let me talk to her.

05:37.004 --> 05:40.549
I can talk to her.
You can't quit on such short notice.

05:40.632 --> 05:43.343
I'm sorry, sir. In lreland, we have a sayin'.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.471
"When a boat runs ashore,
the sea has spoken."

05:49.933 --> 05:52.728
Come on! We can't play
three-handed poker.

05:52.853 --> 05:57.316
She's gonna be alone every day.
I'm not leavin' her alone at night, too.

05:57.524 --> 06:02.321
- So bring her. Shejust paints and reads.
- Yeah, and lights things on fire.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.866
That happened once.
I got a fire extinguisher. Just bring her.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.828
Get your ass over here.
Don't forget the Louis Prima record.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.039
Remember, always play for keeps.

06:12.247 --> 06:16.001
All right, all right, all right.
Yeah, I'll be there. OK.

06:18.295 --> 06:20.380
Joon, dinner!

06:30.474 --> 06:32.976
Spaghetti and salad?

06:33.101 --> 06:35.187
In that order?

06:36.855 --> 06:39.441
What happened between
you and Mrs Smail?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.612
She was given to fits of
semiprecious metaphors.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.532
She's a housekeeper,
not an English professor.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.951
She moves things.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.537
She said you wandered off.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.248
Did you leave the house alone?

06:54.373 --> 06:56.458
Define "alone".

06:56.959 --> 07:00.295
You know full well what I'm talkin' about.

07:00.629 --> 07:06.051
I can't be worried about you knocking
another housekeeper into retirement.

07:06.677 --> 07:08.637
First, it was Mrs Larkspur.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.974
A woman deeply
and hygienically disturbed.

07:12.099 --> 07:15.018
- Her hair smelled.
- But then it was Mrs Piltz.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.398
Piltz? The answer's in the question.

07:22.401 --> 07:26.363
Let's face it, Benjamin.
Hiring housekeepers is not your forte.

07:26.572 --> 07:32.411
Well, until I do find another housekeeper,
you are gonna stick close to the house.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.496
understand?

07:36.373 --> 07:40.961
Now have some salad. By the way, I want
you to come with me to my poker game.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.883
- Benny...
- Come on. You'll have a good time.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.719
Web belt and buckle.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.390
Classical Greek martini shaker.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.683
Six turkey-feather darts.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.855
I'll see you with a Deanna Durbin album.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.691
Come on.

08:44.900 --> 08:49.905
- And I'll raise you with a stethoscope.
- Does it have little plastic earpieces?

08:50.113 --> 08:54.368
- What do you care? You never win, Mike.
- I don't want 'em stabbin' my eardrums.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.787
Steering-wheel knob.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.164
Salad Shooter.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.501
'56 Plymouth tyre iron.

09:02.626 --> 09:06.255
- Fold-o.
- You must have a good hand, huh?

09:07.506 --> 09:09.591
No, I'm bluffin'.

09:11.260 --> 09:13.345
Really?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.724
Come on. You gotta play to find out.

09:17.850 --> 09:22.104
OK. 1 50 feet of coaxial cable. Show 'em.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.774
- Full house. Jacks over fours.
- Oh, shit.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.863
I thought he was bluffin'.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.490
Will someone get some air to his brain?

09:33.699 --> 09:36.493
He was bluffing about bluffing.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.579
You're a real pal, Benny.

09:38.787 --> 09:43.083
I got a solution to your housekeeper
problem. You can have my roommate.

09:43.166 --> 09:48.172
That's a terrific offer, Benjamin. Save
you from the chore of Smail shopping.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.674
Those places are such drudgery.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.219
Montgomery and Smails,
Smails and Roebuck, Smails-R-us...

09:54.428 --> 09:56.430
Joon.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.809
- When did you get a roommate?
- Since last week.

10:01.018 --> 10:05.397
My cousin pounded into town and life's
gone from heaven to hell in seven days.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.485
- Just like the good Lord intended.
- 26 years old, he can't even read.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.197
Spends all day polishing my plastic forks.

10:13.322 --> 10:16.867
When you say he can't read,
what do you mean? Like words?

10:17.075 --> 10:20.913
Yeah. And he keeps me up all night
watchin' stupid old movies.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.123
My work's starting to suffer.

10:23.207 --> 10:27.711
- You install cable TV.
- Joon, will you please glue your sequins?

10:29.880 --> 10:33.634
Have we an internal sequin issue
to deal with, Benjamin?

10:33.759 --> 10:36.345
All right, can we make this the last hand?

10:40.098 --> 10:42.184
Come on, come on. Play cards.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.940
Two tickets,
tomorrow night's baseball game.

10:49.274 --> 10:51.568
One Pocket Fisherman.

10:52.528 --> 10:54.696
- Fold.
- Do you ever stay in?

10:59.493 --> 11:01.495
Snorkel mask.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.231
She knows how to rattle the day help.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.611
I think we need to find someone
more understanding than Mrs Smail.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.739
Tell me, how are you two getting along?

12:18.864 --> 12:20.824
us?

12:20.949 --> 12:23.952
Fine. Normal. You know, fine.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.038
- Why?
- I'll level with you.

12:26.455 --> 12:30.959
I think it's time you gave some
serious consideration to a group home.

12:31.877 --> 12:35.422
- She already has a home.
- Benny, she'd be with her peers.

12:35.547 --> 12:40.010
She hates her peers. She's already quit
the two day centres to prove it.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.846
Look, all we need right now
is a new housekeeper.

12:43.055 --> 12:47.017
Well, I know of no one else.
You've been up and down the list.

12:47.226 --> 12:50.229
You might want to consider
that there are some people

12:50.437 --> 12:54.107
more capable of handling
these episodes than you.

12:56.193 --> 13:00.447
I think that you two living together
may not be the best thing any more.

13:02.032 --> 13:05.035
I'm her brother, and I'm her only family.

13:05.160 --> 13:09.414
And we've done just fine,
the two of us, for 1 2 years.

13:09.623 --> 13:15.462
Yes, but her stress level is always
a factor in her display of symptoms.

13:15.587 --> 13:18.799
Her agitation should
be kept to a minimum.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.135
Everybody gets agitated.
Sometimes it's the only option.

13:22.261 --> 13:24.638
Benny, don't get me wrong.

13:24.763 --> 13:28.308
I'm impressed how
you've managed this long.

13:28.517 --> 13:32.271
But a group home would let her
develop other relationships.

13:32.479 --> 13:36.024
We don't know this,
but what if she were capable of a job?

13:36.108 --> 13:38.610
They'd encourage her in that direction.

13:38.735 --> 13:43.407
These are very nice places -
nurturing, supportive.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.617
I'm not farming her out.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.353
I have every right to be outside, Officer.

14:13.437 --> 14:15.522
- I have every right.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.650
May I see some ID, please?

14:32.331 --> 14:37.336
- Waldo, did you start that brake job yet?
- Joon called. You've run out of tapioca.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.964
- She what?
- Oh, and the police will corroborate.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.135
Holy shit.

14:47.137 --> 14:50.557
Listen, Jack, you wanna go
to the baseball game tonight?

14:50.682 --> 14:52.851
- Hey, thanks, Benny.
- Box seats.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.482
Hello? Joon?

15:14.873 --> 15:16.834
Time for your medicine, Joon.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.022
Good night, Steve.

16:30.657 --> 16:35.037
- Oh, hello. How's it goin'?
- I appreciate the deal on the engine.

16:35.662 --> 16:39.625
- No problem. Is it runnin' all right?
- Yeah, it's running great.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.336
- Good.
- So... can l...

16:42.461 --> 16:44.838
Can I make it up to you with some dinner?

16:46.215 --> 16:48.300
Some dinner?

16:48.383 --> 16:51.637
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Dinner with you.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.351
You know what? I can't.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.853
- I mean, I'd like to...
- It's OK.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.064
OK.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.778
Stupid. Stupid.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.836
- 18-1 5.
- 17-16.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.463
- 18-1 5!
- It caught the corner.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.883
- It was a foot off the table.
- It was not.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.094
- Juniper...
- Benjamin...

17:32.302 --> 17:36.139
Don't underestimate the mentally ill.
We know how to count.

17:36.348 --> 17:41.061
- OK, fine. 17-16.
- You can't give me what was mine.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.564
- You're trying to cheat.
- I'm not.

17:43.772 --> 17:47.192
- You're cheating.
- Joon, you're the one who's cheating.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.737
You're all trying to cheat me.
You're trying to cheat.

18:04.626 --> 18:08.589
Yeah. I spoke to some of the guys
on the staff, Benny.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.883
Nobody wants to be a housekeeper.

18:12.968 --> 18:18.056
I will. I'll keep tryin'. But I gotta
tell you honestly, I don't think so.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.267
Yeah. OK. Thanks.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.187
Bye.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.938
OK, Stevie.

19:35.217 --> 19:40.013
I mean, I can't even keep a goldfish alive.
What chance do I have with Joon?

19:40.222 --> 19:42.850
If somethin' bad happened to her, I'd...

19:44.935 --> 19:48.063
I'd never ever be able to forgive myself.

19:48.272 --> 19:51.191
A group home
is the right thing for her, Benny.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.319
Yeah. This is definitely for her own good.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.282
Hey, it's for both your own good.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.452
How much longer
can you do this to yourself?

20:02.536 --> 20:04.830
Your life is literally passing you by.

20:07.332 --> 20:09.960
You're right.

20:10.169 --> 20:12.754
You're right.
What am I doing with myself?

20:14.339 --> 20:18.385
I spend my life workin' on cars
and takin' care of my sister.

20:18.594 --> 20:23.932
I can't have a relationship without havin'
to worry about how Joon is gonna fit in.

20:24.141 --> 20:27.686
Once she gets settled in,
you could actually take a vacation.

20:27.895 --> 20:30.689
Travel a little. I can hold down the fort.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.900
Travel?

20:33.734 --> 20:38.197
- Travel?
- Benny, there's a whole world out there.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.116
I mean, picture yourself on the open road.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.744
Wind in the hair in the EI Camino.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.246
Highway stretchin' out...

20:46.330 --> 20:48.415
What's that, up ahead?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.543
A lovely motorist, stranded.

20:51.668 --> 20:54.671
Carburettor trouble. Better investigate.

20:54.796 --> 20:58.133
Yeah, right.
I'm gonna be stoppin' every 1 5 minutes

20:58.342 --> 21:00.636
to call Joon to see how she's doin'.

21:03.222 --> 21:06.975
OK, let's see. Black Sabbath, over there.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.312
- Is that a flashlight?
- It's a brush kind of a thing.

21:10.521 --> 21:12.606
Here's a hat.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.943
- Where's the batteries?
- You didn't win batteries.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.862
- Those are mine.
- OK. Hey, guys, hurry it up!

21:19.071 --> 21:21.073
Or we'll start without you.

21:21.907 --> 21:24.493
I've been known to play a little cards.

21:44.638 --> 21:46.723
Box of 30-aught-6 cartridges.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.897
Medium-sized, green-haired troll.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.234
Soap-on-a-rope, slightly used.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.239
- Cards?
- Three.

22:03.282 --> 22:05.367
- Cards?
- Two.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.412
And the dealer takes...

22:09.121 --> 22:11.206
three.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.171
Pass.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.425
Re-grout my shower. Blue grout.

22:22.801 --> 22:24.761
I fold.

22:27.181 --> 22:29.141
Shampoo my dog.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.852
Lava lamp.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.648
Paint the exterior of my house.

22:36.857 --> 22:40.944
Hey, come on, slow down.
This is supposed to be reasonable stakes.

22:41.153 --> 22:44.781
That's a see and a raise. You follow me?

22:50.746 --> 22:54.917
- You take my cousin off my hands.
- Wait, wait, wait. Just stop.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.879
- Benny's gonna strangle you guys.
- Chill out, Thomas.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.176
- Joon, we gotta go.
- Flush!

23:08.889 --> 23:11.266
Full house.

23:12.226 --> 23:14.311
Yes. Yes!

23:14.394 --> 23:18.774
- Benny, tonight's your lucky night.
- Mike warned her it was for keeps.

23:18.899 --> 23:21.193
What? What was for keeps?

23:22.861 --> 23:25.030
I lost.

23:25.239 --> 23:29.409
- What's in the pot?
- A cousin.

23:58.814 --> 24:02.359
Rules are rules. Without 'em
there's no order in the universe.

24:02.568 --> 24:05.696
Don't you give me that crap.
You took advantage.

24:05.821 --> 24:10.409
Of your sick sister. A heart flush
is a perfectly respectable hand.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.120
- Not respectable enough.
- Hey, shut up, Mike.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.957
I am not takin' this guy home.

24:17.082 --> 24:20.002
You have to! Remember
the bet I lost last year?

24:20.085 --> 24:23.213
When I had to re-plate your socket set,
I didn't back out.

24:23.422 --> 24:26.758
You can't bet a human being!

24:27.384 --> 24:30.095
Oh, well,
if you're gonna be a baby about it...

24:30.220 --> 24:33.849
All right, Mike.
You wanna play like that? I'll take him.

24:34.683 --> 24:40.022
I may not be responsible for what
I'm gonna do to him, but I'll take him.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.324
Oh, man.

24:53.243 --> 24:56.705
- What are you doin', you jerk?
- Somethin' wrong with your car.

24:56.914 --> 24:59.833
- What did you do with my hubcaps?
- I don't know.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.841
- I'm Sam.
- So I hear.

25:09.218 --> 25:11.303
I'm Benny.

25:12.763 --> 25:14.848
With an n?

25:15.474 --> 25:17.559
Yeah. Two of 'em.

25:20.062 --> 25:22.231
- This is Joon.
- With an n?

25:23.690 --> 25:25.692
One.

25:27.861 --> 25:30.364
You're out of your tree.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.408
It's not my tree.

25:34.535 --> 25:36.620
I think I need a beer.

25:38.413 --> 25:43.293
Hey, Benny, wait a minute! Where are you
going? Come here! Gimme a jump! Hey!

25:55.514 --> 25:57.474
You're goin' with them.

26:09.987 --> 26:12.072
Oh! God bless you.

27:29.233 --> 27:32.361
Hey, pal, we're tryin' to work here,
if you don't mind.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.072
Oh, my God!

27:35.822 --> 27:40.702
"I've been looking for my boyfriend.
Have you seen him?"

27:40.911 --> 27:42.913
Ruthie, a ghost come back to haunt you?

27:44.456 --> 27:47.501
"Oh, Brad! Oh, Brad!
Brad, please don't be dead!"

27:47.584 --> 27:51.672
"I never got a chance to tell you what
you meant to me. Oh, Brad, please!"

27:51.880 --> 27:56.677
It's you, Ruthie Mallenek, co-star of The
Prom Queen Mutilator with Dick Beebee.

27:56.885 --> 27:59.388
- You saw that?
- "He was mine!"

27:59.596 --> 28:01.139
"He was mine!"

28:01.265 --> 28:04.685
"No. Cindy, you're sick. You need help!"

28:04.810 --> 28:07.938
"No, Cindy! No! No!"

28:08.021 --> 28:10.107
"No!"

29:14.129 --> 29:16.423
Don't... Don't touch it.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.717
It's paint.

29:18.842 --> 29:20.928
Yes.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.353
Kirk Douglas. Van Gogh. Ear.

29:33.732 --> 29:36.777
These are yours.
You can sleep here. All right?

29:39.780 --> 29:42.699
It's late. Let's brush your teeth and hair.

29:43.742 --> 29:47.412
- I can brush my own teeth, Benjamin.
- Fine.

29:47.496 --> 29:49.581
- Hair, too.
- Perfect.

29:49.706 --> 29:51.667
Come on.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.923
Oh. Oh, Benny.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.800
Hey, Benny.

30:00.342 --> 30:04.304
Thanks for the couch.
Mike made me sleep under the sink.

30:04.805 --> 30:06.807
Oh. You're welcome.

30:08.058 --> 30:10.018
- Good night.
- Good night.

31:29.181 --> 31:31.141
Mentally ill.

31:32.726 --> 31:35.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:35.938 --> 31:38.232
But, I mean, don't worry about it.

31:38.440 --> 31:43.153
But just let her go about her routine.
Her routine is everything to her.

31:43.237 --> 31:46.782
Oh, and don't hang around her room
while she's painting.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.992
- She hates that.
- No.

31:49.076 --> 31:51.995
If she runs hot and cold on you,
just ignore it.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.206
That's just the way it works.

31:57.543 --> 32:03.257
Listen, if she starts talkin' to herself,
don't worry about it, but don't answer.

32:04.216 --> 32:05.133
OK.

32:05.342 --> 32:10.556
She sometimes hears voices in her head.
That comes with the territory, too.

32:10.889 --> 32:17.020
And... just make sure that nothin'
- and, you know, I mean nothin' -

32:17.145 --> 32:19.439
happens to her.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.985
OK.

32:23.193 --> 32:25.779
OK. All right.

33:34.806 --> 33:37.017
Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?

33:55.452 --> 33:58.163
- Morning.
- Hey. This today?

33:58.288 --> 34:00.249
Yeah.

34:02.251 --> 34:05.045
So... what'd you do with the cousin?

34:06.004 --> 34:09.842
The bus station? The river?
What? You throw him in the river?

34:11.009 --> 34:14.012
- No, I took him home.
- You took him home?

34:14.137 --> 34:16.223
- Yeah.
- To your house?

34:16.306 --> 34:19.226
- Yeah, to my house.
- What, are you crazy?

34:19.434 --> 34:21.853
Hey, believe me, it's only temporary.

34:22.062 --> 34:25.815
Great. Hey, maybe he can tell Joon
about the group home, huh?

34:27.150 --> 34:32.281
If I'm gonna do this group-home thing,
I gotta figure out the best way to tell her.

34:32.364 --> 34:34.449
Where's Waldo? ls he not here yet?

34:34.574 --> 34:38.328
- No.
- That's it. I'm gonna have a talk with him.

34:38.536 --> 34:41.540
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am. What's his phone number?

34:41.665 --> 34:44.668
555-0944.

35:08.442 --> 35:12.529
# Too late to cry, she turned away

35:12.738 --> 35:15.115
# I started pushin'

35:16.992 --> 35:21.079
# I saw no future in this lack

35:21.163 --> 35:23.874
# I started pushin'

35:23.999 --> 35:26.084
# Pushin', pushin' forward back

35:26.293 --> 35:28.045
# I was pushin'

35:28.170 --> 35:30.047
# Pushin', pushin' forward back

35:30.255 --> 35:32.341
Too loud! Too loud!

35:33.592 --> 35:35.260
# Pushin' forward back

35:35.344 --> 35:37.638
What?

35:38.263 --> 35:39.515
What? Oh!

36:29.773 --> 36:31.859
Hey.

36:33.235 --> 36:35.195
Where's Sam?

36:36.446 --> 36:40.742
I didn't mean to kick him out. I mean,
I didn't kick him out, he just left.

36:40.826 --> 36:42.911
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:43.036 --> 36:45.539
What happened? Did something happen?

36:46.582 --> 36:48.750
He just... He just left.

36:48.876 --> 36:50.961
He was... He was...

36:51.044 --> 36:53.130
in the air and, and, and...

36:54.298 --> 36:57.009
with a thing and... It was really loud...

36:57.843 --> 36:59.803
It was really loud.

36:59.928 --> 37:03.473
And I just kept seeing...

37:05.225 --> 37:07.644
He didn't mean to do it.

37:07.728 --> 37:10.772
Do it? What?

37:10.981 --> 37:12.941
What did he... What did he do?

37:15.235 --> 37:17.446
He cleaned the house.

37:29.333 --> 37:31.835
And you kicked him out for that?

38:00.489 --> 38:02.783
Maybe I should invite him back in.

38:03.742 --> 38:08.830
Yeah. Before someone sticks a stamp
on his head and mails him to Guam.

39:03.802 --> 39:06.305
Some cultures...

39:06.388 --> 39:09.516
are defined by their
relationship to cheese.

39:11.101 --> 39:13.187
Is that a fact?

39:27.242 --> 39:29.328
He can really cook, can't he?

39:31.747 --> 39:33.624
Yeah.

39:33.707 --> 39:37.377
Although, for grilled cheese,
I might've used the wool setting.

39:37.461 --> 39:39.546
That's what I told him.

39:41.965 --> 39:44.051
Really?

39:45.177 --> 39:47.804
- What did he use?
- Rayon.

39:49.264 --> 39:51.433
Silk would've been too soggy.

39:51.558 --> 39:54.061
- Cotton would've...
- Would've burned it.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.230
Right.

39:56.855 --> 40:01.360
Fortunately he consulted me
before giving it steam. I was against it.

40:09.493 --> 40:11.453
I wish he could be my new Smail.

40:26.176 --> 40:31.056
# The melodious songs of the blessed

40:32.099 --> 40:37.521
# And our spirits shall sorrow no more

40:38.480 --> 40:44.111
# Not a sigh for the blessing of rest

40:45.153 --> 40:50.242
# ln the sweet by-and-by

40:50.993 --> 40:56.623
# We shall meet on that beautiful shore

40:57.457 --> 41:02.254
# ln the sweet by-and-by

41:03.088 --> 41:08.177
# We shall meet on that beautiful shore

41:58.018 --> 42:00.020
Good night.

42:00.646 --> 42:02.731
Good night.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.711
You need some help?

42:30.884 --> 42:35.138
"Dear Mom, I've departed Mike's
with love and gratitude

42:35.264 --> 42:40.352
and am now living with Benny and
Joon Pearl, two devoted new friends."

42:40.978 --> 42:45.482
"Benny's predisposition to hypertense
lrish monologists notwithstanding,

42:45.691 --> 42:48.068
he has given me a job
as a domestic engineer

42:48.193 --> 42:50.487
and seems pleased with me so far."

42:50.696 --> 42:52.781
"Love, Sam."

42:52.990 --> 42:54.950
Wow.

42:55.075 --> 42:57.578
I didn't know I could talk like that.

43:15.387 --> 43:17.389
Tapioca?

43:18.098 --> 43:20.100
Oh. Yeah.

43:30.110 --> 43:32.196
- OK.
- Thank you, Ruthie.

43:33.238 --> 43:36.783
You're welcome, Sam.
Let me know if you need anything, OK?

43:43.665 --> 43:45.959
You don't like raisins?

43:46.043 --> 43:48.545
- Not really.
- Why?

43:51.882 --> 43:53.884
They used to be...

43:54.092 --> 43:56.678
fat and juicy.

43:56.803 --> 44:00.224
And now they're twisted.
They had their lives stolen.

44:02.935 --> 44:06.897
They taste sweet, but really
they're just humiliated grapes.

44:08.899 --> 44:12.319
I can't say I'm a big supporter
of the raisin council.

44:13.153 --> 44:18.283
Did you see those raisins on TV?
The ones that sing and dance and stuff?

44:18.492 --> 44:21.078
- They scare me.
- Yeah. Me, too.

44:21.203 --> 44:25.457
It's sick. They make them sing
and dance so people will eat them.

44:26.917 --> 44:29.002
It's a shame about raisins.

44:29.753 --> 44:31.713
- Cannibals.
- Yeah.

44:35.801 --> 44:38.303
Do you like avocados?

44:38.512 --> 44:40.472
They're a fruit, you know.

44:41.431 --> 44:43.100
Ruthie?

44:43.308 --> 44:45.269
Do you got any avocados?

44:59.783 --> 45:01.869
Joon?

45:13.213 --> 45:16.341
You're very pretty
when you're off work, Ruthie.

45:16.884 --> 45:21.263
- Thank you. Maybe I should quit my job.
- Where the hell have you two been?

45:21.471 --> 45:24.266
Don't worry. They were with me,
running some errands.

45:24.474 --> 45:26.476
- Oh, hi. How you doin'?
- Hi.

45:26.685 --> 45:29.271
Running errands? You ran an errand?

45:29.396 --> 45:31.565
Yes, I did. I ran an errand.

45:33.775 --> 45:36.987
They're both named Steven.
One with a v and one with a ph.

45:37.196 --> 45:42.117
- Look, look, look! Ruthie's movie.
- Yes. And she's staying for dinner, too.

45:44.411 --> 45:46.496
Come on in. Come on in.

45:50.459 --> 45:53.253
- So why'd you leave?
- LA?

45:53.378 --> 45:55.339
I wasn't that good of an actress.

45:55.547 --> 45:57.966
Well, that's not how Sam tells it.

45:58.050 --> 46:02.429
- He's ravin' about you.
- Well, he's sweeter than he is judgmental.

46:07.226 --> 46:09.311
How long have you known him?

46:09.436 --> 46:13.690
Sam? uh... 72 hours.

46:13.815 --> 46:15.776
- Be serious.
- I am serious.

46:15.984 --> 46:18.403
- Really?
- I'm always serious.

46:19.238 --> 46:21.323
I'm too serious.

46:27.579 --> 46:32.459
D'you ever get to the point in your life
where nothin' makes any sense?

46:35.921 --> 46:38.006
Brad? Brad?

46:42.052 --> 46:45.180
Quit kidding around.
This isn't funny any more.

46:46.974 --> 46:49.560
Can we turn this off?
Can we just turn this off?

46:49.685 --> 46:50.936
No!

46:51.770 --> 46:53.730
You!

46:53.939 --> 46:55.524
Cindy!

46:55.607 --> 46:59.069
Why did you do this? You're sick.

46:59.152 --> 47:01.572
You need help.

47:01.655 --> 47:04.700
Let me... Don't!

47:05.117 --> 47:08.537
He was mine. He was mine!

47:08.662 --> 47:11.248
And ifl can't have him, no one can.

47:11.373 --> 47:16.587
Not even you.
You didn't have to buy that same dress.

47:16.670 --> 47:19.089
But you are my sister, Cindy.

47:19.173 --> 47:24.803
I'm sorry about Brad. We didn't mean to
fall in love at the party. Itjust happened.

47:25.429 --> 47:29.391
Let's just forget it. There'll be
other boys, other midnight swims,

47:29.600 --> 47:31.602
other prom dresses.

47:32.519 --> 47:34.938
No! No, Cindy!

47:48.160 --> 47:50.787
Try it again.

47:55.375 --> 47:58.378
Ah. There's only two reasons
a car won't start:

47:58.587 --> 48:02.257
either you're not gettin' fuel
or you're not gettin' fire.

48:02.341 --> 48:04.426
You've got fire.

48:05.177 --> 48:07.888
I think you'd better let me drive you home.

48:10.057 --> 48:12.267
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

48:26.657 --> 48:28.951
Here it is. It's right here.

48:29.034 --> 48:31.119
- Second job, huh?
- Yeah.

48:31.245 --> 48:33.622
Gotta make those ends meet, you know.

48:39.586 --> 48:41.964
This is just how I imagined your place.

48:44.049 --> 48:46.260
- Well...
- You wanna come in?

48:46.343 --> 48:48.428
Or you wanna...

48:48.554 --> 48:50.514
Oh. No.

48:50.722 --> 48:53.141
I'll come in. For a minute.

48:54.685 --> 48:56.687
Whoa! What is this?

48:58.772 --> 49:02.109
- Nice place.
- Pretty nice fish Joon gave you.

49:02.317 --> 49:04.278
Oh, yeah. Those fish.

49:04.403 --> 49:06.989
Yeah, I was shocked. I was...

49:07.114 --> 49:10.325
- Nice fish. I mean, yeah...
- I never had a fish.

49:10.450 --> 49:12.411
What? Not even as a kid?

49:13.370 --> 49:17.541
No. underprivileged childhood, I guess.

49:17.624 --> 49:20.335
- Downright un-American, if you ask me.
- Yeah.

49:20.460 --> 49:25.966
- You can have one of mine, if you want.
- No, I couldn't possibly. They were a gift.

49:26.091 --> 49:30.971
But we could share it. Like joint custody.
You could take it on the weekends.

49:32.556 --> 49:34.516
What is this?

49:34.641 --> 49:37.853
Sit down, son. You're makin' me nervous.

49:52.034 --> 49:54.119
- Wanna beer?
- Yeah.

49:58.207 --> 50:00.292
You know what? I better not.

50:00.375 --> 50:03.420
I gotta get goin'. I better get goin', OK?

50:03.504 --> 50:05.714
Yeah.

50:05.797 --> 50:08.509
- OK.
- I'll take a rain check on the beer.

50:08.634 --> 50:10.594
I got the doors.

50:11.345 --> 50:13.430
- Wanna go to dinner?
- Ever been married?

50:13.639 --> 50:15.599
- No.
- Yeah.

50:15.724 --> 50:17.893
Yeah?

50:18.101 --> 50:19.770
Great.

50:19.978 --> 50:21.980
- See ya.
- See ya.

50:22.814 --> 50:24.775
See ya.

52:25.729 --> 52:28.440
- See you next week.
- Right. Thank you.

52:28.982 --> 52:31.360
Benny, would you
come inside a moment?

52:32.319 --> 52:34.279
Sure.

52:39.493 --> 52:42.746
- Who's the new housekeeper?
- The new...

52:42.955 --> 52:44.915
Oh! This...

52:45.040 --> 52:48.460
friend just came to stay
with us for a while, but...

52:48.585 --> 52:50.671
Joon tells me he's a man.

52:52.214 --> 52:55.551
Well, you know Joon,
how flowery she gets with words.

52:56.802 --> 52:59.513
So she's lying?
I mean, is it a man or isn't it?

52:59.638 --> 53:03.058
Well... Yes, technically.

53:04.101 --> 53:06.311
He's really just a guy, a friend.

53:06.520 --> 53:11.942
Where does this leave the group home?
I take it you haven't talked to her about it.

53:12.150 --> 53:14.319
No, not yet.

53:15.279 --> 53:17.990
The admission date
is less than a week away.

53:18.073 --> 53:22.035
But the thing is, she's really doin' fine.
She seems content.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.538
Let's just leave it at that for now.

53:25.706 --> 53:28.083
Let me know when you want to
tell her about it.

53:28.208 --> 53:30.169
I'll let you know.

53:30.294 --> 53:32.254
OK. Bye.

53:45.726 --> 53:47.811
- Hello.
- I want to help.

53:49.479 --> 53:51.356
Wonderful. OK.

53:51.440 --> 53:55.611
If you'd like to fill out this application,
I'll be right with you.

54:37.861 --> 54:40.030
Not so hard.

54:40.155 --> 54:42.866
Wow. You actually have cuticles.

54:43.075 --> 54:45.577
I know. That's amazing.

54:46.411 --> 54:48.789
What the hell is he doin'?

54:48.914 --> 54:50.999
Mashed potatoes.

54:52.459 --> 54:55.254
So are you and Ruthie
considering itemhood?

54:57.673 --> 54:59.633
Are you?

55:03.303 --> 55:06.098
# Benjamin and Ruthjamin, sittin' in a tree

55:06.849 --> 55:09.351
# K-i-s-s-i-n-g

55:09.977 --> 55:12.062
# First comes love, then comes marriage

55:12.145 --> 55:15.482
- Get outta here!
- # Then comes a little baby carriage

55:15.607 --> 55:17.985
I'm just takin' her out to dinner.

55:45.846 --> 55:48.223
- That's a good joke.
- Did you like that?

55:56.773 --> 55:58.859
- What time you got?
- It's eleven.

56:02.738 --> 56:04.698
- On the nose?
- Right exactly.

56:10.120 --> 56:14.917
I don't think I've asked anybody the time
before and had it been right on the nose.

56:15.042 --> 56:18.253
That's weird, isn't it?
It's right on the nose.

56:40.776 --> 56:43.487
Do you... Do you want
to come in for a while?

56:46.406 --> 56:48.408
I...

56:50.786 --> 56:53.080
I've got that beer waiting for you.

56:56.542 --> 56:58.502
You know what?

57:02.589 --> 57:04.967
I should probably go.

57:05.092 --> 57:07.469
- OK.
- Listen.

57:09.054 --> 57:11.849
Can l... Can I tell you somethin'?

57:11.974 --> 57:13.934
What?

57:17.187 --> 57:19.273
You see,

57:19.356 --> 57:24.778
my life is just real... complicated, and...

57:24.987 --> 57:28.240
Gimme a break, Benny.
I just offered you a beer, OK?

57:40.544 --> 57:42.504
No.

57:45.007 --> 57:47.634
Why don't we pick up Ruthie
and get some ice cream?

57:47.843 --> 57:49.803
- Yeah, let's get her.
- No.

57:49.928 --> 57:52.723
- Why?
- Because she doesn't want to talk to me.

58:18.290 --> 58:20.375
Come on. We should go.

58:22.461 --> 58:24.546
Knock it off.

01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:13.966
He is... He's incredible.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:17.427
He's amazing.

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:33.902
- Did you have to go to school for that?
- No, I got thrown out of school for that.

01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:36.071
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:37.531 --> 01:01:40.450
Hey, listen.
Why don't you guys go ahead?

01:01:40.576 --> 01:01:42.953
I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.

01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:45.163
- Really?
- Yeah. Go ahead.

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:47.332
I'll see you at home, later.

01:01:48.375 --> 01:01:50.460
- All right?
- OK.

01:01:50.586 --> 01:01:52.754
- That was great.
- No, no, no.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:55.048
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:01:55.257 --> 01:01:57.259
Bye-bye.

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:33.480
# When the road gets dark

01:03:36.191 --> 01:03:39.653
# And you can no longer see

01:03:41.822 --> 01:03:45.492
# Just let my love throw a spark

01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:51.623
# And have a little faith in me

01:03:54.251 --> 01:03:58.922
# And when the tears you cry

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:05.596
# Are all you can believe

01:04:06.221 --> 01:04:11.435
# Just give these lovin' arms a try, baby

01:04:12.603 --> 01:04:16.440
# And have a little faith in me

01:04:17.274 --> 01:04:20.736
# And have a little faith in me

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:27.409
# And have a little faith in me

01:04:29.703 --> 01:04:33.540
# And have a little faith in me

01:04:36.168 --> 01:04:40.005
# And have a little faith in me

01:04:43.759 --> 01:04:46.803
# When your secret heart

01:04:49.806 --> 01:04:53.560
# Cannot speak so easily

01:04:55.979 --> 01:04:59.608
# Come here, darlin',
from a whisper start

01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:05.864
# To have a little faith in me

01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:11.411
# Have a little faith in me

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:17.459
# Have a little faith in me

01:05:20.796 --> 01:05:23.090
Joon?

01:05:23.298 --> 01:05:25.259
What?

01:05:29.346 --> 01:05:31.306
I love you.

01:05:34.768 --> 01:05:36.728
Me, too.

01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:49.032
- Don't tell Benny.
- OK.

01:05:51.743 --> 01:05:55.497
# When the road gets dark

01:05:58.125 --> 01:06:01.879
# And you can no longer see

01:06:03.755 --> 01:06:07.509
# Just let my love throw a spark

01:06:10.012 --> 01:06:13.765
# And have a little faith in me

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:20.439
Did you see the way you had everyone
in the palm of your hand, huh?

01:06:20.522 --> 01:06:23.358
You've got this gift
and you shouldn't ignore it.

01:06:23.567 --> 01:06:27.613
- You should be doin' something with it.
- Like what?

01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:32.618
I don't know. All I know is I looked at you
and I said "This guy is somethin' else."

01:06:32.826 --> 01:06:36.997
You're not some schmo like the rest of us,
who do what we do because we have to.

01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:39.499
You're blessed.

01:06:40.334 --> 01:06:42.544
- Benny?
- What?

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:46.715
- How sick is she?
- She's plenty sick.

01:06:46.924 --> 01:06:50.552
- Now, I've been doin' some thinkin'.
- Because it seems to me,

01:06:50.761 --> 01:06:54.431
except for bein' a little
mentally ill, she's pretty normal.

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.643
Do you realise you could be
the next Buster Keaton?

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:46.233
I'm tellin' you, Randy. Listen.
You've got to see this guy.

01:07:46.358 --> 01:07:48.318
- Tell him, Eric.
- He's funny.

01:07:48.527 --> 01:07:52.823
- He's amazing. Will you see him?
- Yeah, I'll see him. You never know.

01:07:53.031 --> 01:07:57.286
Most of these guys just work locally,
but the better ones I can book out of town.

01:07:57.411 --> 01:08:01.582
- You book 'em out of town?
- All over. Detroit, Boston, sometimes LA.

01:08:01.790 --> 01:08:05.127
Whoa! Really? Can you see him tonight?

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:07.296
I'd love to see him tonight.

01:08:09.089 --> 01:08:12.009
- Hi.
- Is my car ready?

01:08:12.217 --> 01:08:14.178
How you doin'?

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:16.388
Come on in. Come on in.

01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:22.310
Listen, I want to apologise for
the other night. That all came out wrong.

01:08:22.519 --> 01:08:24.813
- No. No, it's OK.
- No, I really...

01:08:24.938 --> 01:08:27.232
- How's my car?
- It's runnin' great.

01:08:27.441 --> 01:08:30.777
Your fuel pump was shot.
I threw in a new one. It's great.

01:08:30.986 --> 01:08:32.946
How much do I owe you?

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:38.785
I'll tell you what. Give me $30 for the part.
I'm not gonna charge you for labour.

01:08:39.203 --> 01:08:41.287
OK?

01:08:41.705 --> 01:08:46.292
Listen, if you're not doin' anything later,
I just lined up this thing for Sam.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:49.546
- What thing?
- It's kinda like an audition.

01:08:49.755 --> 01:08:53.175
Maybe his chance to make a living
at all this crazy stuff he does.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:57.679
Who knows? Maybe he could travel,
play clubs. I don't know, you know.

01:08:57.763 --> 01:09:00.599
So if you're not doin' anything later and...

01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:04.435
I don't know, Benny.
I got food to deliver, apartments to rent...

01:09:04.645 --> 01:09:08.106
My life's pretty complicated
right now. You know?

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:12.486
Thanks. Bye.

01:09:16.532 --> 01:09:19.660
We'll lay out the whole routine
right after dinner.

01:09:19.785 --> 01:09:23.830
You know what you could start with?
Remember the roll thing in the diner?

01:09:23.956 --> 01:09:26.332
Who died and made you Ed McMahon?

01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:30.921
What is your problem? This is his chance
to do somethin', be somebody.

01:09:31.046 --> 01:09:34.258
- He is somebody.
- Yeah, I know, but he wants to be more.

01:09:36.676 --> 01:09:38.761
You don't know what he wants.

01:09:39.595 --> 01:09:43.225
I know he doesn't want to be
a housekeeper for the rest of his life.

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:47.813
If you're worried about a new Smail,
don't worry, we'll get a new Smail.

01:09:50.232 --> 01:09:52.192
He's not my Smail.

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:55.529
Housekeeper, whatever.

01:10:05.873 --> 01:10:07.958
We have to tell him.

01:10:13.797 --> 01:10:15.883
What?

01:10:16.717 --> 01:10:18.802
Tell me what?

01:10:26.101 --> 01:10:28.187
Benny...

01:10:30.689 --> 01:10:33.400
Joon... and...

01:10:33.483 --> 01:10:35.569
and l...

01:10:36.195 --> 01:10:38.906
are... you know.

01:10:53.003 --> 01:10:54.880
Bullshit.

01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:02.596
You...

01:11:08.227 --> 01:11:10.187
- Don't!
- Get the fuck out.

01:11:14.983 --> 01:11:17.486
You can't throw him out. I won him.

01:11:17.694 --> 01:11:20.113
You just settle down. Just settle down.

01:11:20.197 --> 01:11:22.282
- I love him!
- Yeah?

01:11:22.407 --> 01:11:24.368
Well, you are crazy!

01:11:26.161 --> 01:11:28.664
I am not crazy.

01:11:29.915 --> 01:11:32.835
You see what we've come to? You see?

01:11:35.838 --> 01:11:37.923
I hate you!

01:11:39.299 --> 01:11:41.260
I hate you!

01:12:17.671 --> 01:12:19.631
Can I get you anything?

01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:25.596
Tapioca.

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:29.850
OK.

01:12:29.975 --> 01:12:32.060
Anything on it?

01:12:34.021 --> 01:12:36.106
Raisins.

01:12:37.774 --> 01:12:39.776
OK.

01:13:49.721 --> 01:13:51.807
Hi.

01:14:29.970 --> 01:14:33.223
- Hi. How you doin'?
- You're out late.

01:14:33.307 --> 01:14:35.392
Yeah.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.520
Listen.

01:14:39.146 --> 01:14:41.231
Do you have any tapioca?

01:14:42.482 --> 01:14:47.613
- Jeez, I've heard a lot of lines in my life...
- No, no, no, it's not for me. It's...

01:14:48.947 --> 01:14:51.658
It's for Joon.

01:14:54.912 --> 01:14:56.872
- Come on in.
- Yeah?

01:15:50.676 --> 01:15:52.761
Joon.

01:15:53.512 --> 01:15:55.472
OK?

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:57.683
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

01:16:14.783 --> 01:16:16.743
I'm not. No, no, I'm not.

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:27.296
OK? All right?

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.637
Hold tight. OK. Shh. It's OK.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.225
It's OK.

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:48.233
I am not! I am not! I am not!

01:17:02.623 --> 01:17:04.917
Shut up!

01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:08.670
No, no. No, no.

01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:24.311
- Joon, please, come on.
- No, it's not all in my head.

01:17:33.904 --> 01:17:35.989
Sir? Sir!

01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:38.700
Stop the bus, please!

01:17:40.077 --> 01:17:42.037
Please stop the bus!

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:10.190
No!

01:18:11.775 --> 01:18:13.735
Joon.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:26.665
- All righty. You wanna step out?
- Yeah, OK. Yeah, OK.

01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:30.210
- How you doin', hon?
- You think I don't know who you are?

01:18:30.419 --> 01:18:32.421
I know just who you are!

01:18:33.338 --> 01:18:35.632
So just leave. Leave.

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:37.843
Leave!

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:49.396
Don't you touch me! Don't touch me!

01:19:06.622 --> 01:19:08.582
Joon? Joon!

01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:42.157
Look, I am going to see my sister. Would
you please just tell me her room number?

01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:47.162
- Please, just come back in the morning.
- Let me talk to her goddamn doctor!

01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:51.875
I'm sorry. She doesn't want any visitors.

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:54.378
Not you or anyone else.

01:19:55.003 --> 01:19:57.089
She doesn't wanna see me?

01:19:57.172 --> 01:19:59.258
No. And she doesn't want to leave.

01:20:01.677 --> 01:20:05.514
Benny, why don't you go home?
Get some sleep.

01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:08.767
I promise I'll keep in touch.

01:20:29.830 --> 01:20:32.332
I hope you're happy.

01:20:32.541 --> 01:20:35.544
I hope you are happy with
what you have done to her.

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:40.966
You just stay the hell away
from my sister.

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:45.762
No.

01:20:47.764 --> 01:20:50.475
Wanna know why
everyone laughs at you, Sam?

01:20:51.393 --> 01:20:53.478
Because you're an idiot.

01:20:53.604 --> 01:20:56.398
You're a first-class moron.

01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:08.702
- You're scared, Benny.
- I'm what?

01:21:10.078 --> 01:21:12.247
You're scared.

01:21:12.456 --> 01:21:15.709
I can see it. And I know why.

01:21:18.921 --> 01:21:21.006
I used to look up to you.

01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:24.259
But...

01:21:24.468 --> 01:21:26.428
now I can't look at you at all.

01:21:55.332 --> 01:22:00.420
# Come down offyour throne
and leave your body alone

01:22:02.422 --> 01:22:04.800
# Somebody must change

01:22:07.302 --> 01:22:11.807
# You are the reason
I've been waitin' so long

01:22:13.892 --> 01:22:16.687
# Somebody holds the key

01:22:17.855 --> 01:22:25.028
# Well, I'm weary
and ljust ain't got the time

01:22:27.656 --> 01:22:34.121
# And I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home

01:22:46.842 --> 01:22:52.472
# Come down on your own
and leave your body alone

01:22:53.932 --> 01:22:56.643
# Somebody must change

01:22:58.812 --> 01:23:04.026
# You are the reason
I've been waitin' all these years

01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:07.905
# Somebody holds the key

01:23:09.156 --> 01:23:15.913
# Well, I'm weary
and ljust ain't got the time

01:23:18.123 --> 01:23:20.083
# Oh, no

01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:26.256
# Cos I'm wasted
and I can't find my way home

01:23:28.342 --> 01:23:31.470
- I think Fred Astaire is the way to go.
- Yeah?

01:23:31.678 --> 01:23:35.641
- That's a good choice.
- Who was that woman in Roman...

01:23:35.724 --> 01:23:38.435
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Yeah. Sam, thanks a lot.

01:23:39.478 --> 01:23:41.480
Have a nice day.

01:23:50.447 --> 01:23:53.867
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I hope so.

01:23:58.997 --> 01:24:01.083
- Hi, Benny.
- Thomas.

01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:04.920
How is she? Tell me the truth.

01:24:05.045 --> 01:24:09.216
- She's been better, Benny.
- You gotta tell me what room she's in.

01:24:10.342 --> 01:24:15.055
335. But don't even think about it, Benny.
It's a closed ward. No visitors.

01:24:15.472 --> 01:24:20.686
- No, we've gotta find Joon. Please.
- Thomas, get us in there to see her.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:25.774
- It's impossible, Benny.
- What do you mean, it's impossible?

01:24:25.899 --> 01:24:28.485
Listen, I just need two minutes with her.

01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:30.696
Benny, I'll get fired!

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:32.865
Thomas,

01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:35.158
I'm beggin' you, as a friend.

01:24:35.701 --> 01:24:40.080
I'd love to help you out, but Garvey's
gonna be in there to check on her soon.

01:24:40.289 --> 01:24:42.875
My hands are tied. My hands are tied!

01:24:51.633 --> 01:24:54.344
What room did he say?

01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:56.221
335.

01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:53.422
Shit.

01:26:57.301 --> 01:26:59.261
What are you doin'?

01:27:03.015 --> 01:27:03.974
Mommy?

01:27:04.183 --> 01:27:08.437
- What are you doin' here?
- I don't think you're supposed to be here.

01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:11.982
- Get the door.
- How'd he get past Security?

01:27:12.191 --> 01:27:14.193
Hey, watch the door.

01:27:41.386 --> 01:27:43.388
Joon.

01:27:45.557 --> 01:27:48.060
Look, I know you want to be left alone.

01:27:48.185 --> 01:27:51.605
But you do not belong in here.

01:27:52.773 --> 01:27:54.733
Now,

01:27:55.484 --> 01:27:59.112
how would you like to try
livin' in your own apartment?

01:28:04.243 --> 01:28:07.246
- An apartment?
- Yeah.

01:28:07.996 --> 01:28:11.333
There's an apartment
available in Ruthie's building.

01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:14.962
You'd let me live in an apartment?

01:28:15.712 --> 01:28:18.090
That's up to you.

01:28:19.466 --> 01:28:22.469
I'm through makin'
those decisions for you.

01:28:29.142 --> 01:28:31.144
Listen, l...

01:28:33.021 --> 01:28:36.024
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

01:28:36.650 --> 01:28:40.404
And about Sam, I was wrong.
I was dead wrong.

01:28:42.072 --> 01:28:45.325
- I scared him away.
- No, you didn't.

01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:47.494
He's here.

01:28:47.619 --> 01:28:50.122
- He is not.
- He's here. He got me in here!

01:28:50.205 --> 01:28:53.041
- He's somewhere in the building.
- He is not.

01:28:54.293 --> 01:28:56.378
You'd never let me have him.

01:28:58.463 --> 01:29:00.424
God.

01:29:02.426 --> 01:29:05.012
Why do you hate me so much?

01:29:07.097 --> 01:29:09.183
I don't hate you.

01:29:10.142 --> 01:29:12.227
You need me to be sick.

01:29:20.569 --> 01:29:22.529
Juniper Pearl's chart, please.

01:29:26.617 --> 01:29:27.534
Thank you.

01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:33.790
Hey, wait! Wally! Wait! Wait!

01:29:33.916 --> 01:29:37.127
Put him down! He's mine.
I've been lookin' for him.

01:29:37.252 --> 01:29:39.963
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of him.

01:29:41.215 --> 01:29:44.843
- Sam, you can't be in here.
- Where's Joon's room?

01:29:44.968 --> 01:29:47.971
- I've gotta see her.
- Come on, come on.

01:30:02.361 --> 01:30:04.988
Give me a reason why
I shouldn't have you arrested.

01:30:07.366 --> 01:30:09.368
- It's that one.
- Yeah.

01:30:09.576 --> 01:30:12.162
See? Sam, where you goin'?

01:30:13.539 --> 01:30:16.959
Benny, this is exactly
what we were trying to avoid.

01:30:17.501 --> 01:30:21.255
By now, Joon would be in a caring
and controlled environment.

01:30:21.463 --> 01:30:24.383
Isn't it obvious now that
you two need some distance?

01:30:24.466 --> 01:30:26.760
Why don't we ask Joon what she wants?

01:30:29.888 --> 01:30:31.890
Sam, what are you doin'?

01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:37.813
Hey, Sam, come on! Get down, right now!

01:30:38.647 --> 01:30:40.732
I don't know exactly what I want.

01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:48.156
I do know... that I am tired of
everyone telling me what to do.

01:30:51.285 --> 01:30:53.245
Sam, come on!

01:30:53.370 --> 01:30:55.455
Don't touch that!

01:30:55.539 --> 01:30:57.624
Sam, leave that! I'm beggin' you!

01:30:58.375 --> 01:31:00.752
Joon, we want what's best for you.

01:31:02.004 --> 01:31:04.089
I know that.

01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:15.058
I...

01:31:15.767 --> 01:31:17.853
Sam, come down now!

01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:22.024
You're gonna get in trouble!

01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:25.152
I think I want to try
living in my own apartment.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:42.669
Hm. I don't know.

01:31:43.921 --> 01:31:46.006
Sam, stop swinging!

01:31:50.302 --> 01:31:52.471
But I'm willing to let you try.

01:31:55.182 --> 01:31:57.684
I'll prepare the papers for her release.

01:31:59.269 --> 01:32:01.230
Thank you, Dr Garvey.

01:32:04.358 --> 01:32:06.568
Come down! Sam!

01:32:09.488 --> 01:32:11.573
Whoa! Whoa!

01:32:12.824 --> 01:32:14.910
- Are you OK?
- Ouch! Ouch!

01:32:34.304 --> 01:32:36.390
I know.

01:32:37.307 --> 01:32:39.393
Me, too.

01:32:41.395 --> 01:32:43.355
I'm gonna check you out, OK?

01:32:49.111 --> 01:32:51.196
OK.

01:34:20.577 --> 01:34:22.663
Haven't we tried this before?

01:34:23.705 --> 01:34:26.708
Yeah, but my life's
a lot less complicated now.

01:34:30.087 --> 01:34:32.589
- Is Joon inside?
- Yeah.

01:34:32.714 --> 01:34:34.800
OK.

01:34:58.907 --> 01:35:02.244
# When I wake up,
well, I know I'm gonna be

01:35:02.327 --> 01:35:05.163
# I'm gonna be the man
who wakes up next to you

01:35:06.206 --> 01:35:09.543
# When I go out,
yeah, I know I'm gonna be

01:35:09.793 --> 01:35:12.504
# I'm gonna be the man
who goes along with you

01:35:13.422 --> 01:35:16.884
# lfl get drunk,
well, I know I'm gonna be

01:35:17.009 --> 01:35:20.554
# I'm gonna be the man
who gets drunk next to you

01:35:20.762 --> 01:35:24.224
# And ifl haver,
yeah, I know I'm gonna be

01:35:24.308 --> 01:35:27.019
# I'm gonna be the man
who's haverin' to you

01:35:28.437 --> 01:35:31.648
# But I would walk five hundred miles

01:35:31.773 --> 01:35:35.319
# And I would walk five hundred more

01:35:35.569 --> 01:35:39.740
# Just to be the man
who walked a thousand miles

01:35:39.823 --> 01:35:42.743
# To fall down at your door

01:35:50.292 --> 01:35:53.629
# And I would walk five hundred miles

01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:06.141
