WEBVTT

00:02.200 --> 00:04.367
Bobby looks pretty
good in that uniform.

00:04.400 --> 00:05.367
yup.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.367
yup.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.700
Mm-hmm.

00:07.733 --> 00:09.800
Think the cougars
have a chance this year?

00:09.833 --> 00:11.800
no.

00:11.833 --> 00:12.800
no.

00:12.833 --> 00:13.867
Nah-uh.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074

00:49.667 --> 00:50.833
( grunt )
shh!

00:57.000 --> 00:58.467
paint.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.200
Boys, the welton wolves

01:00.233 --> 01:03.367
have already put their mark
on this bridge.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.099
Now, what does a cougar do

01:05.132 --> 01:08.133
when a wolf comes
into his neck of the woods?

01:08.167 --> 01:09.700
Beats him
in football?

01:09.733 --> 01:12.600
Yeah, that's where I was
going to end up, bobby.

01:12.633 --> 01:14.733
Now, you cougars
can't be winners

01:14.767 --> 01:16.467
until you act
like winners.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.233
And winners paint bridges.

01:18.267 --> 01:19.567
( rattling )

01:19.600 --> 01:20.833
here you go, winner.

01:28.100 --> 01:29.400
( sighing ):
oh.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.900
boys, the important thing
to remember is

01:31.933 --> 01:33.233
you're from arlen

01:33.267 --> 01:36.567
and arlen once had
a great team.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.033
We were behind by two

01:38.067 --> 01:40.367
but luckily, we had
the finest strategist

01:40.400 --> 01:42.567
ever to come out
of heimlich county

01:42.600 --> 01:44.233
coach whitey sauers.

01:44.267 --> 01:46.000
Now, how we going to win state

01:46.033 --> 01:47.467
if we don't get to state?

01:47.500 --> 01:50.033
Now go out there
and get me to state!

01:50.067 --> 01:51.867
You get us to state
and I guarantee

01:51.900 --> 01:55.133
i'll kiss each one of you little
pansies right on the mouth.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.033
Let's go!

01:56.067 --> 01:57.200
( yelling )

01:59.633 --> 02:00.800
down. Down. Set.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.700
( speaking gibberish )

02:02.733 --> 02:03.933
like a dang ol' blitz.

02:03.967 --> 02:05.933
Change plans--
fake hand off to hank

02:05.967 --> 02:07.767
come around, blitz, fake reverse

02:07.800 --> 02:09.167
hike!

02:13.900 --> 02:15.167
Yahoo!

02:15.200 --> 02:17.633
( yelling )

02:24.800 --> 02:26.100
( cheering )

02:26.133 --> 02:27.767
we did it!

02:27.800 --> 02:30.533
We did it!

02:30.567 --> 02:32.933
We're going to state!

02:32.967 --> 02:35.300
Yahoo!

02:42.633 --> 02:45.133
Damn, that man could coach.

02:45.167 --> 02:47.200
How romantic.

02:47.233 --> 02:48.033
What?

02:48.067 --> 02:49.167
That mom was there

02:49.200 --> 02:51.067
and she saw you make that play

02:51.100 --> 02:52.933
and then, right after the game

02:52.967 --> 02:55.067
she canceled her date
with that guy

02:55.100 --> 02:57.533
who ended up building
all those airports.

02:57.567 --> 03:00.233
Just paint
the dang bridge.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.900
( whistle blows )

03:04.933 --> 03:06.900
yeah. Good play.
way to go.

03:06.933 --> 03:07.900
Uh-huh!

03:07.933 --> 03:09.733
Uh-huh!

03:09.767 --> 03:10.767
Uh-huh, uh-huh,
uh-huh!

03:10.800 --> 03:13.433
We need to blitz more.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.767
I haven't done my sack
dance all day.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.900
Settle down, bobby.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.567
That's the kind of attitude

03:18.600 --> 03:20.900
that drove mark gastineau
into boxing.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.867
Do not just stand
there scratching,
coach maxwell!

03:23.900 --> 03:26.767
You are not going
to find a good
play up there!

03:26.800 --> 03:28.833
Maxwell, you suck!

03:28.867 --> 03:31.767
Now, wendy, honey,
that is over the line.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.700
You need specific
criticism

03:33.733 --> 03:35.233
not just
generalities.

03:35.267 --> 03:38.433
Maxwell, your plays suck!

03:38.467 --> 03:39.533
Much better!

03:41.367 --> 03:45.567
Ah! Wingo!
interception joseph!

03:45.600 --> 03:47.367
( laughing ):
ah!

03:47.400 --> 03:48.667
whoo!

03:48.700 --> 03:51.267
That's our boy,
a real all-american!

03:51.300 --> 03:53.433
Arlen's native son!

03:53.467 --> 03:54.433
( laughing )

03:54.467 --> 03:55.767
man:
heads up!

03:55.800 --> 03:56.733
uh!

03:59.100 --> 04:01.600
Sorry, the ball got away there.

04:01.633 --> 04:03.733
Coach coleman lucas, "the wind."

04:05.967 --> 04:08.733
Uh, excuse me,
could you face
the other way

04:08.767 --> 04:10.767
or something
when you do that?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.067
We got a real sport
going on here.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.667
It's called "football."

04:14.700 --> 04:16.867
Actually,
in the rest of the world

04:16.899 --> 04:18.567
soccer is called "futbol."

04:18.600 --> 04:20.200
You should try it.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.333
Soccer, or "futbol," is
excellent physical conditioning.

04:23.367 --> 04:24.633
What's the point?

04:24.667 --> 04:26.733
Anyone can kick the
ball under the goal.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.100
( laughing ):
no... Not if the goalie
has anything to say about it--

04:30.133 --> 04:31.533
He tries to stop them

04:31.567 --> 04:33.767
but don't worry,
it's all in good fun.

04:34.600 --> 04:35.867
( cheering )

04:37.367 --> 04:38.567
two minutes?

04:38.600 --> 04:40.467
Oh, my god,
we could win this thing.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.267
Well, all right, uh,
two minutes

04:42.300 --> 04:43.600
who hasn't played yet?

04:43.633 --> 04:45.333
Uh, bobby hill.

04:45.367 --> 04:46.567
Get in there!

04:46.600 --> 04:48.400
Coach, you can't
put me in now.

04:48.433 --> 04:49.667
We can win this.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.567
Hank, he's putting
your boy in.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.500
I'm on it.

04:52.533 --> 04:54.767
It's just bad strategy.

04:54.800 --> 04:56.933
Uh, hey, coach, uh,
bobby's been cheering

04:56.967 --> 04:58.633
awfully hard today

04:58.667 --> 05:01.500
and I'm afraid he might have
worn himself out already...

05:01.533 --> 05:02.833
You know I like to play

05:02.867 --> 05:04.567
every player at least
two minutes a game.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.333
Can't you just let him play
four minutes next game?

05:07.367 --> 05:09.467
Bobby, mittens, honey!

05:16.000 --> 05:18.500
"do not put bobby in

05:18.533 --> 05:27.300
if outcome of the game
can be affected in any way."

05:27.333 --> 05:28.533
There.

05:28.567 --> 05:31.933
Coach maxwell,
I and some of the parents...

05:31.967 --> 05:33.133
You suck.

05:33.167 --> 05:34.767
Now, hold on.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.100
What we have here
are some suggestions...

05:37.133 --> 05:39.200
No, dale's right--
he does suck.

05:39.233 --> 05:42.200
You're not being
paid to screw up.

05:42.233 --> 05:44.433
I-i'm not being paid at all.

05:44.467 --> 05:46.633
In fact, I still haven't
been reimbursed

05:46.667 --> 05:48.500
for last week's pizzas.

05:48.533 --> 05:51.500
( weeping ):
oh, and if you guys
aren't too busy...

05:51.533 --> 05:53.867
Could you just please
go to hell?

05:53.900 --> 05:58.100
Dale, what did you do
with last week's pizza money?

05:58.133 --> 06:00.433
I bought a hat.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.367
You know who

06:04.400 --> 06:05.900
would've won that game?

06:05.933 --> 06:07.267
Coach sauers.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.767
Yeah.
yep.
mm-hmm.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.233
Yeah, you know who
would've not played bobby?

06:11.267 --> 06:12.967
Coach sauers.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.800
Yep.
Yeah.
coach sauers.

06:14.833 --> 06:18.067
And-and you know who we should
get to coach bobby's team?

06:18.100 --> 06:19.467
Coach sauers!

06:19.500 --> 06:22.267
That's a gribble
of an idea, bill!

06:22.300 --> 06:23.567
Yeah.
all right.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.400
Coach sauers,
that's what I said!

06:27.433 --> 06:29.400
If those are
tight in the toes

06:29.433 --> 06:31.533
i'll get you a
half size bigger.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.200
Hank:
coach sauers?

06:33.233 --> 06:35.567
Hill...
finally got a haircut.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.900
( chuckling )

06:36.933 --> 06:38.033
you noticed.

06:38.067 --> 06:39.933
Boomhauer,
how are your folks?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.733
Man, they're doing fine, man...

06:41.767 --> 06:43.067
Down in florida, man...

06:43.100 --> 06:44.367
Lottery winner, man...

06:44.400 --> 06:45.367
No problems, man.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.700
Sorry to hear that.

06:46.733 --> 06:47.867
Gribble...

06:48.933 --> 06:50.733
No one's killed you yet.

06:52.667 --> 06:53.867
Dauterive!

06:53.900 --> 06:56.233
My god, man,
what happened?

06:56.267 --> 06:57.400
It's a long story.

06:57.433 --> 06:58.867
Do you remember...

06:58.900 --> 07:01.733
Look, coach, uh, we came
by to see you because...

07:01.767 --> 07:05.267
Well, because you're the best
coach arlen has ever seen.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.133
How would you like
to coach again

07:07.167 --> 07:08.633
for my son's
football team?

07:10.967 --> 07:12.967
Coach again?

07:15.900 --> 07:18.600
I quit!

07:18.633 --> 07:20.067
Uh, whoa.

07:20.100 --> 07:23.600
It's, uh, it's
not really a paying job.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.767
Thank you, sir.

07:27.633 --> 07:29.467
I don't know what
i'm doing in this bed

07:29.500 --> 07:31.033
i'm not going to sleep tonight.

07:31.067 --> 07:33.267
Well, hank hill,
you devil...

07:33.300 --> 07:34.467
I am just so excited

07:34.500 --> 07:36.067
that bobby's
going to have

07:36.100 --> 07:37.767
the coach sauers
experience.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.433
I only hope
working at the mall

07:39.467 --> 07:41.400
hasn't knocked
the fight out of him.

07:41.433 --> 07:42.533
I don't know, honey.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.767
That man could be
a tough taskmaster.

07:44.800 --> 07:48.433
Let's not forget that you used
to call him "sour coach sauers"

07:48.467 --> 07:49.800
( laughing ):
remember?

07:49.833 --> 07:52.700
Yeah. Boy, we came
up with that one

07:52.733 --> 07:56.367
at a fellowship
of christian athletes picnic.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.267
"sour coach sauers."

07:58.300 --> 07:59.767
( sighing )

07:59.800 --> 08:01.733
we were good kids, though.

08:03.467 --> 08:06.367
He's a real high school
football coach.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.267
He's tough as nails,
but you're going to love him.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.100
Fellows, my name is coach sauers

08:13.133 --> 08:16.867
and I took arlen high
to state in 1974.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.000
Wow.
Cool!

08:19.033 --> 08:20.300
Up to now, you men
have been losing

08:20.333 --> 08:21.867
but now, you're going
to be winning!

08:21.900 --> 08:23.700
Yeah!
wow!

08:23.733 --> 08:25.500
i'm going to ride you
dainty joes so hard

08:25.533 --> 08:26.867
you'll wish you were all dead!

08:26.900 --> 08:27.867
I'll chew you up!

08:27.900 --> 08:29.067
Spit you out!

08:29.100 --> 08:31.100
Take a big dump on top of that!

08:31.133 --> 08:33.100
And then I'm going to get tough!

08:33.133 --> 08:34.767
( whistling )

08:34.799 --> 08:38.232
let's rev 'em up!

08:38.267 --> 08:40.332
Pretty impressive, huh?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.567
Okay, you kids have fun.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.233
Eat mud.

08:46.267 --> 08:47.700
I said eat it! Eat it!

08:47.733 --> 08:51.267
Coach, I think I swallowed
too much mud.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.567
Take a salt tablet.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.267
I'm walking in biscuit dough.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.533
Memorize it.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.967
( gasping )

09:07.300 --> 09:09.933
that looks like fun.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.600
Boy:
Coach, I'm bleeding.

09:11.633 --> 09:12.967
Sauers:
salt tablet.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.367
( grumbling )

09:15.400 --> 09:16.600
you call that a pass?

09:16.633 --> 09:17.900
Give me that ball

09:17.933 --> 09:19.600
or I'll slice
your guts out, hippie!

09:19.633 --> 09:20.967
run!

09:30.467 --> 09:32.800
Any more of you ladies
want to join him?

09:33.800 --> 09:35.067
Anyone else?

09:36.633 --> 09:37.933
Any more?

09:37.967 --> 09:40.800
All right,
that's enough.

09:40.833 --> 09:41.933
( grunts )

09:41.967 --> 09:44.567
hey, butterball,
drag the body back.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.433
What's that on your upper arm
there, bobby?

09:49.467 --> 09:50.567
Is that a muscle?

09:50.600 --> 09:52.067
No. That's a lump

09:52.100 --> 09:54.933
from when I got hit
by a football.

09:54.967 --> 09:57.200
You know, dad,
the kids playing soccer

09:57.233 --> 09:59.100
don't have any lumps or bruises

09:59.133 --> 10:02.133
and coach lucas gives them
oranges at half-time.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.267
( sighing )

10:03.300 --> 10:04.600
bobby, I didn't think

10:04.633 --> 10:06.533
i'd ever need
to tell you this

10:06.567 --> 10:09.067
but I would be a bad parent
if I didn't.

10:09.100 --> 10:10.433
Soccer was invented

10:10.467 --> 10:12.967
by european ladies
to keep them busy

10:13.000 --> 10:15.600
while their husbands
did the cooking.

10:15.633 --> 10:19.833
Why do you have to hate
what you don't understand?

10:19.867 --> 10:21.500
I don't hate you, bobby.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.167
I meant soccer.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.200
oh.

10:24.233 --> 10:26.067
Oh, yeah, I hate soccer. Yes.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.000
Sauers:
well, there you are, hill.

10:30.033 --> 10:31.767
Now where's butterball?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.700
Uh... "butterball"?

10:33.733 --> 10:34.667
( grunting )

10:34.700 --> 10:36.433
hey, dad.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.433
Uh, hey,
there, bobby.

10:39.467 --> 10:41.600
Are you planning
on loosening up

10:41.633 --> 10:45.233
our football team
with some comedy
soccer skits or...

10:45.267 --> 10:46.933
Or something?

10:46.967 --> 10:48.067
Lucas:
bobby hill!

10:48.100 --> 10:49.700
Time for step
kick drills!

10:51.333 --> 10:53.967
Sorry, dad.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.833
Breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

10:58.133 --> 10:59.933
Take a salt tablet.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.367
Just when coach sauers

11:05.400 --> 11:07.900
was fixing to get
those kids a victory

11:07.933 --> 11:10.800
bobby leaves sports
and joins a soccer team.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.200
Did joseph
leave, too?

11:12.233 --> 11:13.267
no.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.033
The team will
survive, hank.

11:15.067 --> 11:17.767
Yeah, it's a terrible blow
to morale, of course, but, uh...

11:17.800 --> 11:19.233
Peggy:
hank?

11:19.267 --> 11:21.133
Honey, I'm taking bobby
to soccer practice.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.567
You going to soccer practice
dressed like that?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.633
Oh, no, peggy hill.
get real.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.533
You borrow
my nice sweater.

11:28.567 --> 11:29.667
Well, thank you, minh

11:29.700 --> 11:31.067
but it is not
that cold out.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.767
Believe me,
it freezing cold

11:32.800 --> 11:34.233
if you not take sweater.

11:34.267 --> 11:35.600
Well, in that case

11:35.633 --> 11:38.367
I have a perfectly
good flannel overshirt.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.533
Okay. You know better.

11:42.567 --> 11:45.233
Whoo-hoo! Way to go, the wind!

11:45.267 --> 11:48.333
Way to kick that ball downfield!

11:50.800 --> 11:53.233
Oh, thanks for the latte, ally.

11:53.267 --> 11:55.233
Uh, peggy...

11:55.267 --> 11:56.700
Hmm? Oh. Oops.

11:56.733 --> 11:59.900
What a pretty...
overshirt.

11:59.933 --> 12:01.233
Oh, thank you.

12:01.267 --> 12:02.800
And what a pretty sweater...

12:04.067 --> 12:05.667
...you're all wearing.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.900
Well, well, well.

12:08.933 --> 12:11.167
What have
we got here?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.700
A soccer mommy.

12:12.733 --> 12:15.067
Uh, look, coach,
I just want to apologize

12:15.100 --> 12:17.167
for bobby quitting on you
like that.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.433
I know you spent a lot of money
xeroxing these playbooks.

12:20.467 --> 12:21.633
It's the collating.

12:21.667 --> 12:23.200
That's where
they screw you.

12:23.233 --> 12:26.100
If you really feel bad for
the way butterball screwed me

12:26.133 --> 12:28.100
you can be
my assistant football coach.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.733
Uh, I don't know.

12:29.767 --> 12:32.200
With bobby not on the team,
it might make him feel...

12:32.233 --> 12:35.233
Okay, louisa may, go
play your ballerina ball.

12:35.267 --> 12:37.567
Just leave your
penis in the bucket.

12:37.600 --> 12:38.833
Huh. W-well, uh...

12:38.867 --> 12:41.100
I guess I could
find a little time.

12:41.133 --> 12:42.200
Memorize it.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.400
I tell you, peggy

12:45.433 --> 12:48.233
the football team might
go all the way this year.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.867
I sure am sorry you're
not going to be a part
of that, bobby

12:51.900 --> 12:53.567
although you could be.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.700
I can't.
the soccer team needs me.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.733
I'm one of the nine co-captains.

12:57.767 --> 13:01.133
Bobby, I think your father
would like to do something

13:01.167 --> 13:03.267
you both like to do
together, huh?

13:03.300 --> 13:04.600
( clearing throat ):
movie.

13:04.633 --> 13:06.600
Maybe you two
could see a movie together.

13:06.633 --> 13:07.833
Sure. A movie.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.733
Why don't you set it up
through mom?

13:09.767 --> 13:10.967
( groaning )

13:11.000 --> 13:12.700
i'm a little tight.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.867
I got to go
stretch my hams.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.300
Cashmere sweater
with pearl button.

13:17.333 --> 13:18.700
Now they like you.

13:18.733 --> 13:20.467
Oh, it's just a sweater.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.500
If the other mothers
do not like me

13:22.533 --> 13:24.933
for the wit and wisdom
that is peggy hill

13:24.967 --> 13:27.033
then I want nothing
to do with them.

13:27.067 --> 13:28.433
You not get it.

13:28.467 --> 13:30.167
You soccer mom now.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.467
If you not fit in,
then bobby not fit in

13:32.500 --> 13:34.367
and that boy
have enough problem.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.367
How do you know
so much about this?

13:36.400 --> 13:38.467
Connie play a.y.s.o.
in orange county.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.367
That the birthplace
of soccer moms.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.133
I start the whole sweater thing.

13:42.167 --> 13:43.467
That mine.

13:43.500 --> 13:45.267
( whistle blowing )

13:45.300 --> 13:46.300
tie game!

13:46.333 --> 13:48.667
Everyone's a winner!

13:50.067 --> 13:52.000
Hank:
you know, I was thinking

13:52.033 --> 13:54.633
of bringing bobby to
watch the wolves rematch.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.167
You know, just as my guest.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.567
Who, butterball?

13:57.600 --> 13:58.900
Butterball is dead to me.

13:58.933 --> 14:00.100
( bobby laughing )

14:00.133 --> 14:01.167
lucas:
goal!

14:01.200 --> 14:03.667
( kids cheering and laughing)

14:03.700 --> 14:06.033
scoop of vanilla
for everyone!

14:06.067 --> 14:07.500
Dad! We won a game

14:07.533 --> 14:09.700
without having
to beat anyone

14:09.733 --> 14:13.667
and then we practiced
high kicks. Watch.

14:13.700 --> 14:15.300
( falsetto yell )

14:15.333 --> 14:17.167
bobby's our best
high kicker.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.533
Careful, don't let
the rockettes find
out about it.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.900
The rockettes? Me?

14:22.933 --> 14:24.200
"codes of conduct:

14:24.233 --> 14:25.767
"cheer all good plays.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.233
Respect every player
as if he/she were on your team."

14:29.267 --> 14:30.833
What is this "he/she--"

14:30.867 --> 14:33.600
some kind of
a science fiction deal, or...?

14:33.633 --> 14:35.333
You don't get it,
do you?

14:35.367 --> 14:36.633
We're their coaches

14:36.667 --> 14:39.000
but we're the ones
who are learning

14:39.033 --> 14:41.700
and these kids
are pretty good teachers.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.567
All we have to do
is listen.

14:44.733 --> 14:46.333
Now, let's get
going, gang.

14:46.367 --> 14:48.433
We don't want to be late
for our cleanup project.

14:48.467 --> 14:49.933
Uh, wait a minute, bobby. Uh...

14:49.967 --> 14:51.667
I'm sorry, lucas.

14:51.700 --> 14:55.700
I thought I'd take my boy
to see that new space movie.

14:55.733 --> 14:58.200
I hear it's got
special effects.

14:58.233 --> 14:59.633
Sorry, dad.

14:59.667 --> 15:00.933
Got to go.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.633
The one who collects
the most litter

15:02.667 --> 15:04.133
gets to play
goalie next game.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.833
( sighing )

15:05.867 --> 15:09.133
the space movie
with julia louis dreyfus?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.267
( sighing )

15:18.000 --> 15:20.933
you know what
this team needs?

15:20.967 --> 15:22.900
Tradition. Rivalry.

15:22.933 --> 15:24.833
We could go
and paint the bridge.

15:24.867 --> 15:26.067
Great idea,
robert.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.033
We'll cover up
all that graffiti.

15:28.067 --> 15:32.200
But my dad's rematch against
the wolves isn't until tomorrow.

15:32.233 --> 15:34.733
The wolves
haven't even seen it yet.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.667
And if we all work together
as a team, they never will.

15:37.700 --> 15:42.300
This is one time when
the wind use their hands.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.700
Coach sauers

15:45.733 --> 15:47.900
I think there's something wrong
with my helmet.

15:47.933 --> 15:50.067
Then get over there
and do the helmet test.

15:50.100 --> 15:53.333
Put on the helmet
and run into that brick wall.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.067
Yeah, right.

15:55.100 --> 15:57.767
And end up
with headaches
like my mom?

15:57.800 --> 15:59.867
You're going
the wrong way!

15:59.900 --> 16:02.400
Hey, put your helmet
back on!

16:02.433 --> 16:03.933
All right, you big baby!

16:03.967 --> 16:05.167
I'll do it!

16:06.367 --> 16:08.100
( yelling )

16:08.133 --> 16:09.367
ow!

16:11.200 --> 16:12.500
what the...?

16:12.533 --> 16:13.833
You little
panty-wads think

16:13.867 --> 16:15.567
you're ready to play
the wolves again?!

16:15.600 --> 16:16.900
( crazed laughter )

16:16.933 --> 16:18.500
the wolves eat razor blades
for breakfast!

16:18.533 --> 16:21.300
Run, you bunch of
pudgy-butted softies!

16:21.333 --> 16:23.767
Run, with your fancy sneakers
with the pumps and valves

16:23.800 --> 16:26.333
and little lights on the back
that can set off a seizure

16:26.367 --> 16:27.800
but what do you care?

16:27.833 --> 16:29.633
I ran around the world
in a pair of chuck taylors

16:29.667 --> 16:30.767
for the love of pete!

16:34.567 --> 16:37.667
What in god's name
is going on here?!

16:38.933 --> 16:41.000
Damn it! I never
did like you, hill.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.400
You were a know-it-all
and a do-gooder

16:43.433 --> 16:46.500
and your teeny-tiny, weak
little girly ankle bone

16:46.533 --> 16:49.367
snapped in the finals,
and you lost me state!

16:49.400 --> 16:50.600
I lost you state?

16:50.633 --> 16:52.467
I'm the one
who got you to state.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.400
I wish I never dragged you
out of that shoe store.

16:55.433 --> 16:56.667
( coughs ):
are we done yet?

16:56.700 --> 16:59.700
Why, you precious
little candy ass.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.500
I think you hurt him.

17:10.532 --> 17:12.666
Hit him again
to make sure.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.933
What do we do,
assistant coach hill?

17:15.967 --> 17:17.867
We're playing the wolves
on saturday

17:17.900 --> 17:19.300
and we don't have joseph.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.532
Or your kid.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.567
Haven't you kids ever seen rudy?

17:22.599 --> 17:24.933
A little fireplug
of a never-say-quit

17:24.967 --> 17:26.367
at notre dame.

17:26.400 --> 17:29.300
He died of cancer
after the big game, I think.

17:29.333 --> 17:31.933
All right,
hands in the middle.

17:31.967 --> 17:34.700
God bless america,
on three.

17:34.733 --> 17:37.433
One, two, three.

17:37.467 --> 17:40.567
All:
God...

17:40.600 --> 17:41.767
Bless america!

17:43.600 --> 17:46.700
Yeah. Well, I wish
you had a woman, too, bill.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.400
Uh, hold on.

17:48.433 --> 17:49.500
Hill residence.

17:49.533 --> 17:50.633
Hank, coleman lucas.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.067
Just need your fax number

17:52.100 --> 17:54.200
so I can fax over
bobby's soccer diet.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.867
We don't have a fax,
or a fax number.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.900
Oh. Well, just give me
your e-mail address

17:59.933 --> 18:01.700
and I'll attach it.

18:01.733 --> 18:04.800
Yeah, it's "football is great,
soccer is dumb dot com."

18:04.833 --> 18:06.000
Good-bye.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.267
( sniffing )

18:14.067 --> 18:16.300
( imitating fat albert ):
hey, hey, hey!

18:16.333 --> 18:17.467
( chuckling )

18:17.500 --> 18:18.733
oh...

18:21.833 --> 18:24.533
Peggy,
that's a lovely sweater.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.067
Well, you see?

18:26.100 --> 18:28.367
You don't have to look dumpy
at a soccer match.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.933
Which one's your son?

18:29.967 --> 18:33.033
Well, my husband, henry,
is bringing him in the truck.

18:33.067 --> 18:36.800
Uh, oh. You mean
a sports utility vehicle

18:36.833 --> 18:38.633
not a pickup truck?

18:38.667 --> 18:40.300
Well, yes.

18:40.333 --> 18:42.567
I-i-it's red.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.933
Beat those wolves, dad.

18:48.967 --> 18:52.267
Sure. Sure. And you, uh,
you have a good soccer game.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.933
Beat those, uh, fluffy
puffs, or whatever.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.167
Dad, they're called
the puff n' stuffs.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.433
Good. Get a good stretch.
extend.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.767
I know it's bigger
than the other s.u.v.s

19:04.800 --> 19:06.200
but it makes me
feel safe.

19:06.233 --> 19:08.667
I mean, if I have an accident
in that thing

19:08.700 --> 19:10.033
i'm going to live.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.000
I am here for my son,
I am here for my son.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.200
Well, for me, it's
all about convenience.

19:14.233 --> 19:17.467
Mine's got everything
from headlight wipers
to heated seats.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.100
Peggy:
oh, well,
that is a must

19:19.133 --> 19:20.533
isn't it? You
know, my butt

19:20.567 --> 19:22.200
is either warmed
by my car seat

19:22.233 --> 19:23.633
or covered
by my sweater.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.833
I have to keep it at
optimum temperature

19:25.867 --> 19:27.833
or I could die from
mild discomfort.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.067
( faint chuckles )

19:29.100 --> 19:30.900
( chuckling )

19:30.933 --> 19:33.867
oh, and you know what else
would just make me die?

19:33.900 --> 19:37.300
If by mistake I paid so much
attention to my child's game

19:37.333 --> 19:39.033
that I maybe raised my voice.

19:39.067 --> 19:40.867
Oh, I would just die! I would!

19:40.900 --> 19:43.233
Or if I got stuck
with a bunch of losers

19:43.267 --> 19:46.967
who couldn't recognize a dead-on
perfect fat albert impression

19:47.000 --> 19:49.433
well, I would just die
a thousand deaths!

19:49.467 --> 19:50.767
You know what?

19:50.800 --> 19:52.867
I have got
a football game to watch.

19:56.733 --> 19:58.400
Oh. That would
be minh's.

20:04.167 --> 20:05.900
( people cheering )

20:05.933 --> 20:07.400
go, joseph, go!

20:07.433 --> 20:08.533
Slow down, joseph.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.033
We've already got the tie.

20:10.067 --> 20:12.167
We don't have
to hurt anyone's feelings.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.200
Why don't we just give 'em
the dang ball?

20:17.833 --> 20:18.900
( whistle blows )

20:36.767 --> 20:37.967
( cheering )
( sighs )

20:44.067 --> 20:45.500
ah, screw it.

20:45.533 --> 20:46.633
No hands!

20:46.667 --> 20:47.900
You're not the goalie!

20:47.933 --> 20:49.367
Come on, y'all.

20:49.400 --> 20:50.833
We were all cougars once.

20:50.867 --> 20:53.267
We're getting our butts kicked
over there.

20:53.300 --> 20:56.367
I, for one, have had enough
of this dang lawyer ball

20:56.400 --> 20:57.967
haven't you?

21:06.000 --> 21:07.400
( whistle blows )

21:09.333 --> 21:12.400
bobby:
coach, I'm here
if you need me.

21:13.867 --> 21:15.233
Bobby?

21:15.267 --> 21:17.933
I'd rather be
on a losing football team

21:17.967 --> 21:20.667
than a winning soccer team
any day.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.733
Well, all right,
son, you're back.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.433
And I brought joseph
with me.

21:25.633 --> 21:27.267
All right, bobby!

21:27.300 --> 21:28.767
Way to go, son!

21:28.800 --> 21:29.933
Get in there.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.033
Split right.

21:31.067 --> 21:32.267
Buttonhook on two.

21:33.267 --> 21:34.767
That was good strategy

21:34.800 --> 21:36.733
bringing joseph back,
bobby.

21:36.767 --> 21:40.600
Stick with it, and you could
make a good coach someday.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.300
Hmm. I'd still want
to wear my uniform.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.633
Uh, yeah, okay.

21:45.667 --> 21:47.667
And a cape.

22:02.367 --> 22:03.800
Whoo-hoo!

22:03.833 --> 22:06.600
All right!
go, cougars!
go, cougars!

22:06.633 --> 22:08.233
Kick some wolf tail!

22:08.267 --> 22:09.667
Well, well, well.

22:09.700 --> 22:12.467
Peggy hill coming
back to football.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.200
Uh, wendy...

22:17.167 --> 22:19.533
Toss me a beer.

22:24.733 --> 22:27.133
( belching )

22:27.167 --> 22:29.767
coach sauers:
take a salt tablet.
