00:38.163 --> 00:41.541
PRISON WARD

00:45.420 --> 00:48.757
Guys, you're going to the gym now,
so put your shirts on.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.426
Juan Luis López García.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.970
Darwin Morales Ortiz.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.346
Here, sir.

00:55.930 --> 00:57.932
-Gonzalo García Hernández.
-Here.

01:02.353 --> 01:04.272
-Héctor Muñoz Muñoz.
-Here.

01:08.693 --> 01:12.072
I got scared when they started saying
it was kidnapping.

01:13.656 --> 01:17.160
I said, "I just got out of the car
to complain about a fender bender,

01:17.243 --> 01:19.913
and they are pinning this on me

01:19.996 --> 01:23.208
and a bunch of other people
I don't even know."

01:23.291 --> 01:26.044
Who wants to go out
to the street like this?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.296
Someone can just say,

01:28.379 --> 01:31.299
"This guy looks like a kidnapper,
get him."

01:31.382 --> 01:34.511
If they find you guilty,

01:34.594 --> 01:36.846
you get from 90 to 120 years.

01:36.930 --> 01:41.559
How can you spend so many years
in this place, you know?

01:47.732 --> 01:50.360
I'm with my uncle, and Héctor shows up.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.946
Now there are three of us.
Then somebody else joins…

01:53.029 --> 01:55.532
"That's the guy who's accusing you."

01:56.241 --> 01:58.368
I look at Juan Luis and say,

01:58.451 --> 02:01.579
"I don't even know him,
why would he accuse me?"

02:03.039 --> 02:06.042
It's not as believable that two people
would kidnap someone,

02:06.126 --> 02:08.461
but four people, that's a gang.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.381
You all have a common destiny.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.424
It's a complicated story,

02:13.508 --> 02:16.136
and I had trouble understanding it.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.930
We need to put it together
and explain it well.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.056
It was so fast.

02:20.140 --> 02:23.143
In a matter of seconds,
we were in a police car.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.228
Accused of kidnapping.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.692
A NETFLIX DOCUMENTARY SERIES

03:13.276 --> 03:17.530
MACUSPANA PRISON, TABASCO
FEBRUARY 5TH, 2016

03:30.501 --> 03:32.754
Who is here under the new system?

03:32.837 --> 03:34.172
Who had a public trial?

03:36.716 --> 03:38.301
And the old system?

03:41.763 --> 03:44.098
Who has been sentenced?

03:44.682 --> 03:46.684
We have, and we're innocent.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.604
Who's here for kidnapping?

03:52.857 --> 03:56.027
And can I just ask, who's innocent?

03:56.110 --> 03:57.987
Who's innocent here?

03:59.155 --> 04:01.783
A few. And who were tortured?

04:04.327 --> 04:06.704
They knocked your tooth out? You?

04:09.415 --> 04:10.333
Electroshock?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.294
Plastic bag over the head?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.715
Water torture?

04:17.799 --> 04:19.717
The best… water torture.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.638
Mexico had a document-based trial system.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.640
RESEARCHER AND DOCUMENTARY MAKER

04:25.723 --> 04:28.142
Out of the public eye, almost in secret.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.270
Judges were expected to decide

04:30.353 --> 04:33.147
according to what
was written in these files.

04:33.231 --> 04:37.026
There was major uncertainty
about the evidence.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.488
You never knew if they changed statements.

04:40.571 --> 04:44.784
Testimonies were dictated,
instead of there being a reliable record.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.745
So we released the documentary
<i>Presumed Guilty.</i>

04:47.829 --> 04:49.789
Who participated in the arrest?

04:49.872 --> 04:51.207
I don't remember.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.418
-Now…
-Okay, tell me then.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.045
He is lying.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.424
When I was arrested,
there were three people.

04:59.507 --> 05:03.594
One of them kept telling me
he was going to beat me up.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.763
I was hit in the chest.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.766
He had me standing there for hours.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.477
"He had me standing…"

05:11.561 --> 05:13.104
-For hours.
-"For hours."

05:13.187 --> 05:16.524
Judges didn't even attend trials.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.735
They just read the documents

05:18.818 --> 05:22.071
and, based on what they read,
they came to a decision,

05:22.155 --> 05:25.325
sometimes months or years
after the arrest.

05:25.408 --> 05:29.245
The most important evidence
in those files was the confession.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.498
Even if the confession
didn't make any sense,

05:32.582 --> 05:35.543
it was the ultimate evidence,

05:35.626 --> 05:37.628
and everything stemmed from that.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.214
But what triggered <i>Presumed Guilty</i>

05:40.298 --> 05:44.218
was the idea that we could
no longer postpone the reform,

05:44.302 --> 05:45.928
keep it in a drawer,

05:46.012 --> 05:49.640
as Felipe Calderón did for many years.

05:49.724 --> 05:51.893
Five, four…

05:51.976 --> 05:53.811
MEXICO CITY
JUNE 18TH, 2016

05:53.895 --> 05:55.855
…three, two, one.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.153
<i>A milestone in the national legal history.</i>

06:02.820 --> 06:05.615
<i>Thus, it became effective</i>
<i>for the whole country,</i>

06:05.698 --> 06:08.951
<i>after eight years,</i>
<i>the new criminal justice system.</i>

06:09.035 --> 06:13.206
<i>President Enrique Peña Nieto</i>
<i>stated that this is a historic time</i>,

06:13.289 --> 06:15.375
<i>because it is the biggest change…</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:16.626
In the new system,

06:16.709 --> 06:20.004
to avoid confessions
being obtained by torture

06:20.088 --> 06:24.050
and these confessions being treated
in trials as the main evidence,

06:24.133 --> 06:25.468
it was established,

06:25.551 --> 06:28.721
"Nothing that is declared
in the Prosecutor's office

06:28.805 --> 06:31.307
serves as evidence in the trial."

06:31.391 --> 06:34.143
I had a personal reservation.

06:34.227 --> 06:38.356
Was the new system actually better?

06:38.439 --> 06:39.774
So we thought,

06:39.857 --> 06:42.735
"Why don't we ask those who are in jail

06:43.486 --> 06:45.530
how it was, how the judges,

06:45.613 --> 06:48.991
public institutions
and police officers treated them?"

06:49.575 --> 06:53.871
Oddly enough,
one of the first municipalities

06:53.955 --> 06:57.166
to implement the new justice system
was Macuspana.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.934
I was given access
to the prison of Macuspana,

07:15.017 --> 07:19.188
and there, in Villahermosa,
we interviewed a total of 450 inmates.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.075
One of those inmates is Gonzalo.

07:32.243 --> 07:35.705
I was asked about my arrest and all that,

07:35.788 --> 07:39.584
and that's when I started
to open up and tell

07:40.501 --> 07:44.172
the whole story
of how I was arrested and why.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.924
For attempted kidnapping.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.469
Supposedly, I was released,

07:50.094 --> 07:55.308
but then I was arrested again
outside the DA's office for kidnapping.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.770
"This guy is accused
of attempted kidnapping,

07:59.854 --> 08:02.732
and he is also accused
of kidnapping a woman."

08:02.815 --> 08:05.610
"Am I talking to a lying kidnapper

08:05.693 --> 08:07.653
or to an innocent person?"

08:08.237 --> 08:09.530
"It doesn't add up."

08:09.614 --> 08:13.201
I had a bad feeling about it,
but, in spite of that,

08:13.284 --> 08:18.164
I ripped out the last page
of the interview papers I was completing,

08:18.247 --> 08:20.416
and I gave him my phone number.

08:21.083 --> 08:24.712
Between him and his family,
they called me about 100 times.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.174
And one of many evenings, he picked up.

08:28.257 --> 08:32.512
I told him I was the sister
of one of the guys he'd interviewed.

08:32.595 --> 08:35.765
When I was in Mexico City,
I called Roberto, the lawyer.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.309
I told him I was in the city

08:38.392 --> 08:41.729
and that I had some papers with me

08:41.812 --> 08:45.775
that were given to us
while Gonzalo was in prison.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.276
And I also had pictures.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.322
Finally, I said, "Fine, I need to know
what's going on here."

09:15.638 --> 09:18.432
16 HOURS BEFORE HIS ARREST
FRIDAY, JULY 19TH, 2015

09:19.392 --> 09:21.686
July 19th

09:22.311 --> 09:24.021
was a weekday, Friday.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.232
I tell my friend I had been paid,

09:26.315 --> 09:30.444
and he asks me to pick him up
so we can go grab some beers.

09:33.406 --> 09:38.369
I say, "I'll get the beer
and you get the coke, to sober us up."

09:39.620 --> 09:41.998
We start going around Pemex.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.755
Eight o'clock, nine o'clock,
and we keep drinking.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.549
"Let's go get my son," I say.

09:52.508 --> 09:54.093
"We're on a bender here."

09:54.176 --> 09:55.469
"Let's get a driver."

09:57.597 --> 10:00.266
So we pick my son up.
"Really, Dad?" he says.

10:00.349 --> 10:03.269
I tell him that I am drinking
and to go slow.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.313
He is just learning.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.944
It is early morning.

10:12.028 --> 10:16.115
I drop off my son
and he gives me the car keys.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.160
"I'm going to work now," I say.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.911
He says "Don't go, Dad."

10:20.995 --> 10:23.706
"You're drunk, go to bed."

10:23.789 --> 10:25.916
I say, "I have to go. It's close by."

10:28.252 --> 10:33.299
MOMENTS BEFORE HIS ARREST
SATURDAY, JUNE 20TH, 2015

10:38.554 --> 10:41.557
I am almost there,
I have passed the gas station,

10:41.641 --> 10:44.435
and I feel something hit my car,

10:44.518 --> 10:46.562
on the driver's side rear door.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.982
Through the mirrors,

10:50.066 --> 10:53.361
I see a van parking in front of me.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.742
So I park the car on the side.

11:00.326 --> 11:03.245
There's a scratch on the car,
where I was hit.

11:03.329 --> 11:07.124
I get out of the car, leave the door open,
and grab a pair of pliers.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.918
I had them in the door.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.003
So I go to talk to whoever hit me.

11:11.087 --> 11:13.130
I go round the passenger's side,

11:13.214 --> 11:16.509
and say, "Hey, motherfucker,
look what you did!"

11:16.592 --> 11:18.719
And I point to the scratch on my car.

11:19.762 --> 11:23.140
When I look at him,
I see him pointing a gun at me.

11:24.850 --> 11:27.103
He fires and hits my hand.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.980
I run back to my car,

11:30.856 --> 11:34.360
but with my hand like that,
I can only turn the ignition on.

11:34.443 --> 11:38.322
I'm stuck in my seat belt
and I turn on the windshield wiper.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.368
When I look at the van again,

11:42.451 --> 11:46.455
I see a guy getting out,
and the driver shouts, "Finish him!"

11:47.540 --> 11:51.919
When I hear that, I start running
towards the gas station to get help.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.964
I ask for help, nobody helps me.

11:55.047 --> 11:57.508
I see the van turning

11:57.591 --> 11:59.635
and coming into the gas station.

11:59.719 --> 12:04.265
There's a little road behind a wall,
so I go there and start running.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.685
I trip over a ditch, lose a shoe,

12:07.768 --> 12:08.936
but I keep running.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.772
I get tangled
on some vines that were there.

12:12.815 --> 12:15.234
I sit down behind a bush.

12:15.317 --> 12:19.280
I'm thinking, "God, what is this,
what is going on?"

12:20.156 --> 12:22.450
I stay there for ten, 15 minutes.

12:22.533 --> 12:27.413
Suddenly, I see a police car
and start signaling to them for help.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.459
The cops shove me into the patrol car.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.294
Handcuffs on, I'm sat there.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.963
"Why are you taking me?
I had an accident."

12:36.046 --> 12:39.925
"I got out of the car to see the damage
and I was shot."

12:40.009 --> 12:42.136
They say I'm accused of kidnapping.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.304
"What?"

12:53.647 --> 12:58.736
JUAN LUIS AND GONZALO

13:01.906 --> 13:06.577
9 HOURS BEFORE THEIR ARREST
FRIDAY, JUNE 19TH, 2015

13:07.369 --> 13:09.914
We are leaving a town called Apatzingan.

13:15.669 --> 13:18.506
It's a border town, adjacent to Guatemala.

13:22.843 --> 13:26.680
We have people in the car, yes.
We're transporting immigrants.

13:28.808 --> 13:33.312
On the way to Jonuta from Apatzingan,
there are tons of control posts.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.023
CONTROL POST

13:37.858 --> 13:41.487
We are getting near
where we're dropping off these people.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.364
On the riverbank.

13:43.447 --> 13:45.699
A boatman would cross them over.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.785
They'd be on the boat,

13:47.868 --> 13:50.621
and we would meet them later
at another point.

13:52.581 --> 13:55.000
We get there, but can't find them.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.710
We never found them.

13:56.794 --> 14:00.840
Juan Luis says,
"Let's go look a bit further on."

14:00.923 --> 14:03.717
I say, "They are not here, let's go back."

14:03.801 --> 14:05.511
And while I drive,

14:05.594 --> 14:08.222
the van is getting hotter, so I warn him.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.394
We keep driving and I keep saying,
"They are not here."

14:13.477 --> 14:16.272
"I can't go back now, I have no gas."

14:18.566 --> 14:22.152
So we get to this place
called Ciudad Pemex.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.783
Unfortunately, we can't keep going,

14:27.867 --> 14:30.578
because the motor of the van
is about to die.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.456
And we are so tired
that we both fall asleep.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.586
ONE HOUR BEFORE THEIR ARREST
SATURDAY, JUNE 20TH, 2015

14:40.462 --> 14:42.089
Later, I wake up

14:42.756 --> 14:45.092
because they're knocking on the van door.

14:47.136 --> 14:49.305
I look to my side and to the front.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.850
Standing at the window of the van,

14:52.933 --> 14:54.476
I see a cop.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.605
He says, "What are you up to?"

14:57.688 --> 15:00.065
"Nothing, my van overheated."

15:00.649 --> 15:03.319
"I'm just waiting for it
to cool down a bit."

15:03.903 --> 15:06.071
He asks us to get out to check us.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.909
They check us, the van, everything.
They find nothing.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.285
So the cop says,

15:11.368 --> 15:14.246
"Please, move the car.
You're blocking the way."

15:16.248 --> 15:18.918
I start the van, and it starts,

15:19.001 --> 15:23.088
because it always does,
the problem is only that it overheats.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.271
I get to the gas station

15:39.355 --> 15:43.984
and while I'm waiting
for another customer to finish,

15:44.068 --> 15:49.365
I see a van parking
in front of a little green car.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.495
The driver of the green car gets out
and starts walking to the gray van.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.747
And then I hear a gunshot.

15:57.247 --> 16:01.543
He says,
"Hey, did you hear that? A gunshot."

16:01.627 --> 16:03.462
"A gunshot, here? You're nuts."

16:03.545 --> 16:04.505
"Yes," he says.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.091
I see that the guy that was shot

16:07.174 --> 16:10.970
starts running around the gas station.

16:11.053 --> 16:13.097
He tries to go inside Oxxo.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.520
The guy who shot him is running after him,

16:19.603 --> 16:22.022
and I can see he has a gun on his waist.

16:25.442 --> 16:29.989
So I ask the gasoline station worker,
"Why was that guy shot?"

16:30.072 --> 16:34.326
And he says, "I don't know,
maybe he was mugging that man."

16:34.410 --> 16:36.495
And, without knowing, I say,

16:36.578 --> 16:40.124
"Good, they should have shot him twice,
so he stops that."

16:41.542 --> 16:44.962
And I ask him if they have coolant
for the water pump.

16:45.045 --> 16:48.507
And Juan Luis says,
"Go park in front of Oxxo,

16:48.590 --> 16:51.677
I have some coolant behind the seat,
let's use that."

16:56.932 --> 16:58.434
While we park,

16:58.517 --> 17:02.229
a gray van is also
looking for the guy who was shot.

17:03.022 --> 17:06.483
The person following him
and the gray van

17:07.067 --> 17:08.902
are now both looking for this guy.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.780
But we don't care.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.615
It's not our problem.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.247
Suddenly, patrol cars start arriving.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.667
The same patrol car
that had checked on us before,

17:23.751 --> 17:24.877
number 027,

17:25.461 --> 17:28.088
approaches us and checks us again.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.631
They find nothing.

17:29.715 --> 17:34.636
So we were searched twice
by the same police officers.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.473
I tell Juan Luis,
"There's trouble, let's go."

17:37.556 --> 17:40.809
He says, "Relax.
Nothing to hide, nothing to fear."

17:42.895 --> 17:47.191
The patrol cars leave
the same way the guy had run off.

17:49.234 --> 17:53.405
So we keep pouring the engine coolant.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.700
We see the patrol car again,

17:57.367 --> 17:59.578
this time with the guy that was shot.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.498
So far, everything is normal for us.

18:08.003 --> 18:09.379
They come back again,

18:09.880 --> 18:13.425
but now they're more pissed off.

18:13.509 --> 18:17.471
They point their guns at us,
"Motherfuckers, get in the patrol car!"

18:17.554 --> 18:19.014
"But why us?"

18:19.098 --> 18:22.309
"You'll see why. You're fucked."

18:22.392 --> 18:24.728
"They will tell you why later."

18:24.812 --> 18:27.147
"Why don't you tell us?" "They will."

18:27.231 --> 18:28.065
"But who?"

18:33.278 --> 18:36.907
The guys they're taking
aren't kidnappers, they're customers.

18:38.408 --> 18:43.455
Those men always come here to get gas.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.290
They are taking them.

18:48.168 --> 18:51.839
"According to the cop,
you said we were with you."

18:52.339 --> 18:53.674
"With me for what?"

18:53.757 --> 18:56.051
"But we don't even know this guy!"

18:56.135 --> 18:59.721
Juan Luis asks him,
"Why the fuck did you say that?"

18:59.805 --> 19:00.806
"I said nothing!"

19:00.889 --> 19:03.934
"I was just looking
at the scratch on my car."

19:04.017 --> 19:06.270
"No, they're accusing you."

19:06.353 --> 19:09.189
The cops were saying this guy, Héctor,

19:09.273 --> 19:13.694
had said we were with him
trying to kidnap Mr. ACP.

19:13.777 --> 19:16.738
And they were telling Héctor

19:16.822 --> 19:20.450
that we said he was with us
trying to kidnap Mr. ACP.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.162
JUAN LUIS, GONZALO AND HÉCTOR
ON PATROL CAR 027

19:23.245 --> 19:25.164
I wanted to know who they were,

19:25.247 --> 19:27.791
and they wanted to know who I was.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.543
It was very quick and weird.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.045
It all went down in a matter of seconds.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.256
JUAN LUIS AND GONZALO'S VEHICLE

19:46.643 --> 19:49.646
From what I understand,
it was only a car accident.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.357
Héctor had the bad luck
of bumping into a guy

19:52.441 --> 19:56.445
whose sister had been kidnapped
a couple of days before.

19:56.528 --> 20:00.741
And, by chance, Gonzalo and Juan Luis
fell asleep in their van,

20:00.824 --> 20:04.244
parked around 80 meters
from this guy's shop.

20:06.830 --> 20:11.126
ACP has the status
of a victim of undisclosed identity.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.879
A court granted him this protection,

20:13.962 --> 20:16.548
and this protection is an option

20:16.632 --> 20:18.634
offered to victims of kidnapping.

20:19.718 --> 20:23.805
In our country,
people take justice in their own hands.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.976
ACP was armed that day,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.646
and he fired a gun,

20:30.729 --> 20:32.856
and hit Héctor's hand.

20:40.948 --> 20:46.119
STATE OF TABASCO, MACUSPANA

20:46.203 --> 20:50.457
I am so thirsty, I start asking the cops,
begging them almost,

20:50.540 --> 20:53.001
"Please give me water, I'm parched."

20:53.627 --> 20:55.629
There was a bucket of dirty water,

20:55.712 --> 20:58.006
and I ask them for it.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.716
"No, that's no good."

20:59.800 --> 21:02.594
"I don't care, just give it to me.
I'm parched."

21:03.220 --> 21:05.764
He grabs it desperately.

21:05.847 --> 21:09.851
Juan Luis is still insulting him,
asking him why he got us involved.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.187
And I'm just like, "What's going on?"

21:16.483 --> 21:20.279
But in my mind, I am thinking,
"They'll release us soon."

21:25.867 --> 21:28.120
They take us to some offices,

21:28.203 --> 21:31.039
which I guess
are the Municipal Police's offices.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.167
Before getting there,
they start hitting us.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.211
They started hitting me.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.879
They hit me,

21:37.963 --> 21:40.924
here in the head,
in the pit of the stomach.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.510
They ask,
"Why did you want to kidnap him?"

21:43.593 --> 21:47.514
And I was like, "Kidnap?
I got out of the car because I was hit."

21:48.140 --> 21:50.100
"You wanted to kidnap Mr. ACP."

21:50.183 --> 21:52.644
"But I don't even know him," I say.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.230
And the cops keep hitting us.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.567
They insist
that we wanted to kidnap this person.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.862
MUNICIPAL POLICE
MACUSPANA

22:01.945 --> 22:05.741
"You'll leave soon. Just wait for a bit,"
the cops were saying.

22:06.742 --> 22:10.120
We had no idea what was in store for us.

22:21.548 --> 22:24.426
At the same time,
six miles from Ciudad Pemex,

22:24.509 --> 22:26.219
in a little town, San Carlos,

22:26.803 --> 22:28.889
Darwin and Guillermo are arrested.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.308
They work selling pork in a market.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.150
10 HOURS BEFORE HIS ARREST
SATURDAY, JUNE 20TH, 2015

22:40.233 --> 22:43.487
That day, in the morning,
I kill two or three pigs,

22:43.570 --> 22:47.824
fill the truck with more pigs,
and head out to the shop.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.125
I start serving people.

22:57.834 --> 22:59.711
There, I make<i> chicharrones</i>

22:59.795 --> 23:01.505
until 1:00 p.m.

23:03.423 --> 23:06.927
Mrs. Yazmín asks me
to go get her a gas tank,

23:07.886 --> 23:10.013
so I go with her husband, Guillermo.

23:14.476 --> 23:18.855
We are on the road,
and I see some patrol cars behind us.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.526
I even say to Guillermo as a joke,
"They're coming for us."

23:24.778 --> 23:27.406
They surround us,
six or seven patrol cars.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.992
They push me out of the car
and have me stand there.

23:33.537 --> 23:36.832
And they say they suspect
the car is stolen.

23:37.749 --> 23:42.129
"We got a call
saying this car is stolen," they say.

23:43.004 --> 23:44.256
"This car, stolen?"

23:44.339 --> 23:46.633
"Yes, we got a call. We'll check it."

23:47.342 --> 23:49.594
"Sure, check it, because it is mine."

23:51.555 --> 23:56.143
Guillermo and I are both forced
into the same patrol car.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.561
They take us to 2-20.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.625
Once in Villahermosa,

24:20.709 --> 24:24.337
we go to what's supposed to be
the district attorney's office.

24:27.090 --> 24:30.385
MAJOR CRIMES
SECRET OFFICES

24:33.763 --> 24:35.974
By the hair, they throw us to the floor.

24:36.057 --> 24:38.268
The three of us. And they take me.

24:40.854 --> 24:45.775
They handcuff me to a motorbike,
sitting with a wounded hand on the floor.

24:49.112 --> 24:52.199
I said, "That's it,
they're going to kill us."

24:53.074 --> 24:55.577
I ask one cop, "What's up?"

24:55.660 --> 24:57.370
"They'll come get you soon."

24:57.454 --> 25:00.040
"Who?"
"From the district attorney's office."

25:02.501 --> 25:04.044
We are sent to them.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.546
Dressed as civilians,
we don't know who they are.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.049
I say, "Look, my car was hit,

25:09.132 --> 25:12.427
I just got out because of a scratch
and I was shot."

25:13.470 --> 25:16.765
"Fucker, you will speak now,"
says the district attorney.

25:19.267 --> 25:21.436
They bring a bucket,

25:21.520 --> 25:24.856
and I see they start soaking some bags.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.527
They put one over my head,
and I try to shake it off.

25:28.610 --> 25:32.531
When I do, I see two district attorneys,
one sitting, one standing.

25:32.614 --> 25:36.326
The one that's standing
hits me hard on the head a couple times.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.499
They keep tightening the bag,

25:42.582 --> 25:44.584
and I'm getting no oxygen.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.755
I want to breathe, but I can't.
I move around, but nothing.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.592
They see me gasping for air
and hit me here…

25:53.218 --> 25:56.888
That knocks the wind out of me.
They hit me for a while.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.228
They take me and start hitting me.

26:03.311 --> 26:05.814
"Tell us what happened
at the gas station."

26:06.439 --> 26:10.652
"And don't lie or we will fuck you up."

26:11.444 --> 26:13.405
"I saw the security videos,

26:13.488 --> 26:16.116
so if you lie, God help you."

26:16.199 --> 26:19.160
I say, "If you saw
the gas station security videos,

26:19.244 --> 26:21.955
didn't you see
I have nothing to do with this?"

26:22.038 --> 26:26.376
"I had no contact with that person,
I have no idea why I'm here."

26:44.436 --> 26:47.355
During the night,
we're transported in a patrol car.

26:47.439 --> 26:51.276
I want to jump out of it,
because I don't know where we're going.

26:51.359 --> 26:55.780
The police officers are all hooded
and saying they were going to kill us.

26:59.492 --> 27:02.829
We arrive at a three-floor building.

27:03.955 --> 27:07.292
They make us go up, looking down.
There are motorbikes.

27:08.126 --> 27:11.421
When I get out of the car,
they hit me with a gun.

27:11.504 --> 27:14.758
They hit me here,
and it still hurts today.

27:16.134 --> 27:18.219
They want us to confess,

27:18.303 --> 27:21.056
but I keep saying the car is Guillermo's.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.476
They want to see the car documents,
and he shows them.

27:24.559 --> 27:28.229
Now it isn't about the stolen car,
it's about the bullets.

27:29.397 --> 27:32.942
They are saying we have .45 bullets.

27:33.443 --> 27:34.819
"What bullets?"

27:35.403 --> 27:38.907
"We'll take your fingerprints
to check them."

27:38.990 --> 27:40.241
"Fine."

27:40.325 --> 27:42.619
They do that, and nothing comes up.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.668
They hit me to find out
who the bullets belong to.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.253
I say, "I don't know anything about it."

27:52.337 --> 27:55.965
My whole belly is purple by now,

27:56.049 --> 27:59.010
because a cop
keeps hitting me with his knee.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.640
-Where did you meet?
-I don't know.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.226
You don't know?

28:06.309 --> 28:07.477
No!

28:07.560 --> 28:08.895
How many were there?

28:08.978 --> 28:09.938
We were…

28:10.021 --> 28:10.980
Easy now.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.857
They met us there.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.025
How many were you?

28:14.109 --> 28:15.443
No, we weren't…

28:24.953 --> 28:28.623
The figure of the police officer
is demonized as abusive.

28:28.707 --> 28:32.919
We think of them
as repressive and unpredictable.

28:33.002 --> 28:36.172
But put yourself
in the shoes of a police officer.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.383
You think, "What will I work with?"

28:38.466 --> 28:39.843
"What can I do?"

28:39.926 --> 28:44.514
What are the technical resources
to intervene, to document, to surveil?

28:44.597 --> 28:46.307
Are there people, vehicles?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.225
No.

28:47.308 --> 28:51.146
So you have to resort
to certain practices or tactics

28:51.229 --> 28:54.190
that, at some point,
can border on illegality.

28:54.274 --> 28:57.652
Basically, you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.288
Attention!

29:09.706 --> 29:12.083
I want to talk to you about torture.

29:13.543 --> 29:16.588
Raise your hand if you think
there's no torture here.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.803
Not a single person
has raised their hand.

29:24.512 --> 29:27.515
So we all know torture
is being used in this state.

29:28.641 --> 29:30.643
A superior can just say,

29:30.727 --> 29:32.979
"You hit him or I fire you."

29:34.522 --> 29:36.232
And you cannot say,

29:36.316 --> 29:37.859
"No, this is illegal."

29:37.942 --> 29:41.529
"Torture is illegal in Mexico.
I'm sorry, I can't do this."

29:41.613 --> 29:46.201
When you are an authority,
and part of the higher or middle ranks,

29:46.284 --> 29:48.328
you need your people to trust you.

29:48.411 --> 29:52.749
And for that, you can't wash your hands
or cross yourself,

29:52.832 --> 29:56.753
you have to be a part
of the way they are used to doing things.

29:56.836 --> 29:58.505
Things must be accomplished,

29:58.588 --> 30:02.717
even if the tactics used
do not precisely follow the code.

30:02.801 --> 30:07.055
In this case, being a witness of something
without participating,

30:07.138 --> 30:09.641
but something you're also responsible for,

30:09.724 --> 30:11.810
keeps you from earning their trust.

30:11.893 --> 30:15.772
If you don't know the insides
of the beast, the beast will attack you.

30:15.855 --> 30:18.900
We interviewed them at CRESET, Macuspana.

30:18.983 --> 30:22.362
Four hundred and fifty people
chosen randomly.

30:23.112 --> 30:25.949
71% were hit in the chest,

30:26.032 --> 30:28.785
kicked, had their eyes covered,

30:28.868 --> 30:30.370
were punched.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.164
10% were burnt with cigarettes

30:33.748 --> 30:36.793
58% had their head covered with a bag.

30:36.876 --> 30:41.172
From this exercise we did in Macuspana,

30:41.256 --> 30:43.967
the INEGI,
the agency of the Mexican government

30:44.050 --> 30:46.594
in charge of interviews and surveys,

30:47.804 --> 30:51.850
decided to carry out
the first national survey in prisons.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.352
PEOPLE INTERVIEWED

30:54.435 --> 30:56.187
According to this survey,

30:56.271 --> 30:59.983
we estimated that 79% of the people

31:00.066 --> 31:02.360
that are imprisoned in Mexico today,

31:02.443 --> 31:04.571
were tortured or mistreated.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.785
And the people accused of kidnapping
are tortured even more.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.204
If you're accused of kidnapping,

31:13.288 --> 31:18.209
the frequency of torture
reported was 97.5%

31:18.293 --> 31:21.671
So torture is pretty much
statistically certain

31:21.754 --> 31:23.715
if you're accused of kidnapping.

31:24.632 --> 31:27.719
I just included what fit there,
but there's more.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.973
And you, who are about
to start a career in this,

31:32.891 --> 31:36.227
are you willing to be forced
to do this to other people?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.438
No!

31:39.188 --> 31:41.274
And how will you avoid it?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.863
How will you avoid
being forced to do this?

31:47.822 --> 31:50.742
Unfortunately, among some that are guilty,

31:50.825 --> 31:52.660
there are also some innocents.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.747
But as long as we don't have
a first world strategy

31:55.830 --> 31:58.875
of investigation
and justice administration,

31:58.958 --> 32:02.253
or the sufficient technology
to carry out investigations,

32:02.337 --> 32:04.714
we'll have to resort to old tactics.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.978
I'm taken from that place.
"Where are you taking me?"

32:20.563 --> 32:22.190
OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

32:22.273 --> 32:27.070
I don't know what time it is.
We're put in a room with a one-way mirror.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.489
In a police lineup.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.950
They put me in a blue robe.

32:32.575 --> 32:35.328
I see a big mirror.

32:36.371 --> 32:40.249
There are also some cops
wearing the same robes as us.

32:40.333 --> 32:43.670
But they have
their police boots and haircuts.

32:44.629 --> 32:45.922
They know he's a cop,

32:46.005 --> 32:50.051
so, if the other guy isn't in uniform,
he must be the criminal.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.523
And then, I'm taken
to the Rovirosa hospital.

33:03.606 --> 33:07.902
I wake up in a bed among other patients.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.905
My feet are cuffed.
I see a guy next to me.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.032
I say, "I'll give you a number."

33:13.116 --> 33:16.035
"Call my family, I had an accident."

33:16.119 --> 33:20.206
And that's how I communicate with them.
They didn't know where I was.

33:20.289 --> 33:23.292
But what really helps us is that,

33:23.376 --> 33:27.255
from the phone I had hidden,
I manage to call Eva.

33:27.338 --> 33:31.092
I say to Gonzalo, "My brother, my dad,

33:31.718 --> 33:33.052
nobody is picking up."

33:33.761 --> 33:35.763
"What do we do?" "Call my sister."

33:36.347 --> 33:38.975
I told him to stop messing around,

33:39.058 --> 33:42.937
because my sister was in hospital
and I'd just been with her.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.648
He said, "I swear on my kids. Help me."

33:45.732 --> 33:49.235
"They hit us,
I'm afraid they'll do something to us."

33:49.318 --> 33:50.695
I asked him who.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.405
"Gonzalo is here," he said.

33:53.698 --> 33:57.660
So I started investigating
where my brother was.

33:57.744 --> 34:01.622
I first went
to the Prosecutor's office.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.708
I asked there, they said no,

34:03.791 --> 34:06.919
that there was nobody
with that name there.

34:07.003 --> 34:11.674
Not knowing what to do, I went back
into the Prosecutor's office.

34:11.758 --> 34:15.887
There was a security guard there.

34:15.970 --> 34:18.931
He told me to go to another place,

34:19.015 --> 34:21.017
that was like a public department.

34:30.193 --> 34:31.152
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

34:31.235 --> 34:35.156
<i>This is the office</i>
<i>of the Tabasco State General Attorney.</i>

34:36.032 --> 34:38.910
<i>To identify or claim a body,</i>

34:38.993 --> 34:40.328
<i>press one.</i>

34:40.411 --> 34:44.373
<i>For information on suspects detained,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

34:44.457 --> 34:47.543
<i>To report inappropriate behavior</i>
<i>of a public servant</i>

34:47.627 --> 34:50.713
<i>from the Office of the Attorney General,</i>
<i>press three.</i>

34:51.297 --> 34:53.049
I asked that man again.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.927
I had been to where he said
and it wasn't there.

34:56.010 --> 35:00.431
He said, "If you don't know why
he was arrested, go ask over there,

35:00.515 --> 35:02.391
in Major Crimes."

35:04.060 --> 35:07.396
I asked someone else,
and he described my brother.

35:07.480 --> 35:08.731
I said, "Yes."

35:09.315 --> 35:12.610
I asked to see him, but they refused.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.862
The lawyer came, introduced himself,

35:14.946 --> 35:19.242
and said he would take the case,
he would represent Gonzalo.

35:19.826 --> 35:24.580
But he was told Gonzalo already
had a lawyer and didn't need another one.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.290
And they closed the door.

35:26.374 --> 35:30.253
I was told Héctor's car
had been seen with the door open,

35:30.336 --> 35:31.838
but that he wasn't there.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.215
ACP'S VEHICLE - HÉCTOR'S VEHICLE

35:34.298 --> 35:38.261
I thought,
"Maybe he left in his friend's car."

35:38.344 --> 35:42.974
"He must be drinking, so he left his car
and went off with a friend."

35:44.350 --> 35:46.686
So, I think it was on Monday,

35:46.769 --> 35:48.563
my sister-in-law told me,

35:48.646 --> 35:52.150
"Do you know Héctor
is being accused of kidnapping?"

35:52.233 --> 35:55.862
I didn't understand.
Héctor, kidnapping a man?

35:55.945 --> 35:58.281
I figured something was wrong.

35:58.364 --> 36:02.410
Then his brother called me
and said he was in jail.

36:04.453 --> 36:08.124
The first thing I thought
was that he had been caught

36:08.791 --> 36:10.626
with the people he transported.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.462
Immigrants with no papers.

36:14.213 --> 36:16.924
"<i>Pollos</i>," we call them here.

36:18.259 --> 36:21.637
But his brother said it wasn't for that,

36:22.180 --> 36:23.848
that it was pretty serious,

36:23.931 --> 36:26.434
that it was something else,
attempted kidnapping.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.145
I was like…

36:29.228 --> 36:31.230
"Who would he kidnap?"

36:34.025 --> 36:39.906
48 HOURS AFTER THEIR ARREST
MONDAY, JUNE 22ND, 2015

36:40.948 --> 36:44.660
At the district attorney's,
one of the guys says,

36:44.744 --> 36:46.746
"Get ready, you're leaving."

36:47.496 --> 36:49.290
"What?" "Yes, you're leaving."

36:50.082 --> 36:52.168
Mrs. Delfín, the district attorney,

36:52.793 --> 36:54.337
brings us a document.

36:55.630 --> 36:58.132
"You're leaving. We didn't find anything."

36:58.216 --> 36:59.967
AGREEMENT OF RELEASE

37:00.051 --> 37:03.429
We are so excited at that point.
"We're leaving!"

37:04.013 --> 37:05.932
I feel peace, relief.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.934
"Thank you, God," I thought.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.518
"They know!"

37:09.602 --> 37:13.731
"They must have seen the videos
and realized we didn't do anything."

37:17.026 --> 37:18.694
THE EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT

37:18.778 --> 37:22.657
They release us
because they have insufficient evidence.

37:25.201 --> 37:26.160
We sign.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.624
Guillermo pays the bail, 18,000 pesos.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.167
They give me a paper.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.503
"This is your release paper. Sign it."

37:35.586 --> 37:37.004
They give one to Darwin.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.007
Guillermo is released first,
early in the morning.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.551
I stay until the afternoon.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.306
At about four or five,

37:47.390 --> 37:49.225
I am told I am free.

37:55.439 --> 37:58.693
Our families know we're being released
and are thrilled.

37:58.776 --> 37:59.777
They are outside.

38:02.822 --> 38:05.199
They say, "Let's take off the cuffs."

38:05.283 --> 38:06.325
"No, don't do it."

38:06.409 --> 38:10.037
"But they signed the papers,
why are they handcuffed?"

38:13.624 --> 38:16.252
And mockingly, they said,

38:16.752 --> 38:20.881
"They are not free,
they have a bigger problem."

38:24.093 --> 38:27.096
I see a couple of guys standing there,

38:27.179 --> 38:28.889
and they grab me again.

38:32.184 --> 38:37.440
We're put in a van,
and there's another guy in that van too.

38:37.523 --> 38:39.483
"Those are your accomplices."

38:39.567 --> 38:42.445
And that's when I meet
Mr. Juan Luis López García

38:42.528 --> 38:44.196
and Gonzalo García Hernández.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.992
Afterwards, I understood
it was set up by the district attorney,

38:48.075 --> 38:51.829
so it would be more believable
that we were a gang.

38:51.912 --> 38:54.457
But none of it is true.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.586
In the same release document,

38:58.669 --> 39:01.380
it also said,

39:01.464 --> 39:04.467
"There is an order for arrest
in Macuspana, Tabasco."

39:04.550 --> 39:06.552
Mrs. GLP was accusing us.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.472
AGGRAVATED KIDNAPPING

39:10.556 --> 39:12.767
I see the surname and I realize

39:12.850 --> 39:15.436
that they are relatives, they are family.

39:15.519 --> 39:20.733
She is the sister of the man
from the gas station, Mr. ACP.

39:21.776 --> 39:26.238
I say, "I bet he talked to his sister
and told her to accuse us."

39:26.322 --> 39:28.449
Since he shot me in the hand,

39:28.532 --> 39:30.743
he wants to get away with it.

39:47.218 --> 39:51.597
In the early morning, we're taken
to the penitentiary in Macuspana

39:51.680 --> 39:54.058
and put in a cell.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.605
Yes, I was…

40:00.356 --> 40:02.691
scared of being in a penitentiary.

40:02.775 --> 40:04.193
I'd never been in jail.

40:07.571 --> 40:10.199
They say there's another guy involved,

40:10.282 --> 40:13.119
Héctor Muñoz Muñoz, whom I didn't know.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.704
We met in prison.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.376
There's four of us now.

40:20.459 --> 40:24.296
Now it's not about the accident
at the gas station with Mr. ACP,

40:24.380 --> 40:28.843
it's because of this other person,
Mrs. GLP.

40:36.142 --> 40:37.601
<i>Hello, Honorable Court.</i>

40:37.685 --> 40:40.062
<i>Mrs. María del Rosario Delfín Rosales,</i>

40:40.146 --> 40:43.983
<i>prosecutor</i>
<i>appointed to Major Crimes,</i>

40:44.066 --> 40:47.153
<i>with information</i>
<i>and ways of notification established</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.572
<i>in the administration of this court.</i>

40:51.240 --> 40:55.327
<i>The prosecution will prove</i>
<i>beyond a</i> <i>reasonable doubt</i>

40:55.411 --> 41:00.833
<i>that Mrs. GLP,</i>
<i>victim of undisclosed identity,</i>

41:00.916 --> 41:05.254
<i>was deprived of her freedom</i>
<i>on May 26, 2015.</i>

41:05.838 --> 41:07.590
<i>Violently,</i>

41:07.673 --> 41:11.010
<i>the victim was forced</i>
<i>into a green Jetta vehicle,</i>

41:11.093 --> 41:15.014
<i>and was told that her family and herself</i>
<i>would be deprived of life.</i>

41:15.097 --> 41:20.102
<i>For this, all evidence</i>
<i>must be examined closely</i>

41:20.186 --> 41:23.564
<i>to confirm</i>
<i>the participation of the accused:</i>

41:23.647 --> 41:25.733
<i>Juan Luis López García,</i>

41:26.400 --> 41:27.985
<i>Gonzalo García Hernández,</i>

41:28.736 --> 41:31.989
<i>Darwin Morales Ortiz,</i>
<i>and Héctor Muñoz Muñoz.</i>

41:32.072 --> 41:36.035
<i>I request that these subjects</i>
<i>receive the full rigor of the law</i>

41:36.118 --> 41:39.997
<i>and the sentence</i>
<i>that the prosecution suggests.</i>
