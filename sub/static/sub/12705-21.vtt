WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.637
Previously
 on Buffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:03.670 --> 00:05.873
(grunts)
I'm Faith.

00:05.905 --> 00:08.141
I'm gonna go out on a
limb and say there's
a new slayer in town.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.810
(grunting)

00:09.843 --> 00:12.080
GILES:
 She's unstable, Buffy.

00:12.112 --> 00:14.381
BUFFY:
Faith, no!
 You killed a man.

00:14.414 --> 00:17.684
FAITH:
 I don't care.
 No one can stop the ascension.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.853
Mayor's got it wired, B.
 He built this town

00:19.887 --> 00:21.489
for demons to feed on,
 and come graduation day,

00:21.521 --> 00:24.591
he's gettin' paid.
Open your present.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.161
FAITH:
 This is a thing of beauty,
 boss.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.861
No!
(whimpers)

00:28.896 --> 00:29.463
WILKINS:
Faith.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.671
I'm leaving.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.441
After the
ascension.

00:40.473 --> 00:43.110
You don't want to be with me?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.414
I don't.

00:46.447 --> 00:51.652
I can't believe
you're breaking up with me.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.155
(indistinct chatter)

00:57.457 --> 01:00.261
I appreciate it.
Hey, thanks a lot. Okay.

01:00.293 --> 01:03.264
I can't believe
this loser look.

01:03.296 --> 01:05.599
I lobbied so hard
for the teal.

01:05.632 --> 01:10.103
No one ever listens to me,
a lone fashionable wolf.

01:10.138 --> 01:13.441
I like the maroon.
Has more dignity.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.942
Dignity? You? In
relation to clothes?

01:15.975 --> 01:18.045
I'm awash in a
sea of confusion.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.448
I just want to look respectable
in this.

01:20.480 --> 01:23.049
Considering
I'm probably gonna die in it.

01:23.082 --> 01:24.617
Excuse me?
I'm telling you,

01:24.652 --> 01:26.287
I woke up the other day

01:26.319 --> 01:28.588
with this feeling in my gut.
I just know.

01:28.621 --> 01:32.725
There is no way I'm getting
out of this school alive.
Wow,

01:32.759 --> 01:35.728
you've really mastered
the power of positive giving up.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.131
I've been lucky too many times.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.066
My number's comin' up.

01:39.098 --> 01:40.567
And I was short.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.002
One more rotation,

01:42.034 --> 01:43.637
and I'm shipping stateside.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.905
You know what I mean?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.207
Seldom, if ever.

01:51.611 --> 01:54.414
Bye. We'll keep in touch.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.750
Willow, will you sign
my yearbook?

01:56.783 --> 01:58.252
Yeah.
You have to sign mine, too.

01:58.286 --> 02:00.353
(chuckles)

02:03.156 --> 02:04.757
You know,

02:04.792 --> 02:07.194
I really wish we would have got
to know each other better.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.096
Me, too.

02:09.127 --> 02:10.931
I mean, you're so smart.

02:10.963 --> 02:12.765
I always wanted to be like that.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.068
Thanks. You're so sweet.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.338
I hope
we don't lose touch.

02:18.372 --> 02:19.772
No, we'll hang out.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.509
Bye.
Bye.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.510
Aw, I'm gonna miss her.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.944
Don't you hate her?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.947
Yes, with a fiery vengeance.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.949
She picked on me
for ten years.

02:28.981 --> 02:31.352
The vacuous tramp.

02:31.384 --> 02:33.353
It's like a sickness, Buffy.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.188
I-I'm just missing everything.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.191
I miss P.E.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.727
I think it's contagious.

02:39.759 --> 02:44.731
The whole senior class
has turned into the '60s.

02:44.764 --> 02:47.735
Or what I would have imagined
the '60s would have been like,

02:47.768 --> 02:50.170
you know, without the war
and the hairy armpits.

02:50.204 --> 02:51.639
You don't feel it?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.039
No, I don't.

02:53.073 --> 02:56.710
I mean, I guess
I'll miss stuff,

02:56.743 --> 03:00.046
but I just don't get the
whole graduation thing.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.515
I mean, you get a piece of
paper, and nothing changes.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.185
I don't even think
I'm gonna go.

03:05.218 --> 03:08.155
Oh, trusty
soda machine.

03:08.187 --> 03:11.359
I push you for root beer,
you give me Coke.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.162
What do you mean not go?

03:15.194 --> 03:17.330
Why not?

03:17.365 --> 03:19.332
Ascension,
Mayor becoming a demon,

03:19.366 --> 03:21.001
snacking upon populace.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.336
I was planning on fighting him.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.737
We can't do both?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.173
Both what?

03:26.205 --> 03:29.377
Go to graduation
and fight the mayor.

03:29.409 --> 03:31.545
The mayor?

03:31.579 --> 03:34.180
What, you guys didn't hear?
Hear what?

03:34.213 --> 03:37.050
Guess who
our commencement speaker is.
Siegfried?

03:37.084 --> 03:38.286
No.
Roy?

03:38.319 --> 03:39.687
No.
One of the tigers?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.288
Come out of the fantasy, Will.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.689
BUFFY:
I don't

03:42.723 --> 03:45.192
believe this.
Lends credence

03:45.224 --> 03:47.694
to my whole "I'm gonna die"
theorem, doesn't it?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.929
The mayor at graduation?

03:48.961 --> 03:51.598
100 helpless kids to feed on.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.167
You got any other surprises
for us?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.473
(knocking)

03:59.507 --> 04:01.942
Just a moment!

04:06.614 --> 04:08.981
Hi. I'm looking
for Professor Worth.

04:09.015 --> 04:11.419
Oh, well, that's me,
but I should ask you

04:11.451 --> 04:13.721
to come back during
office hours.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.588
Students generally
make an appoint...
Uh, I'm not from the college.

04:15.622 --> 04:18.125
I work for Mayor Wilkins.
I'm Faith.

04:18.158 --> 04:22.129
Oh, well, come
in, please.

04:22.161 --> 04:25.499
I was so surprised
when he called.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.935
Didn't expect
a politician

04:27.968 --> 04:30.403
to be interested in my research.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.773
He's a big fan, Professor.
Oh,

04:32.805 --> 04:34.074
Lester's fine.

04:34.106 --> 04:37.076
We alone here, Lester?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.480
Well... yes.

04:39.512 --> 04:42.983
(chuckles)
Lifelong bachelor.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.586
Like my space.

04:45.619 --> 04:49.423
I hear that. You want to turn
and face the wall, Lester?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.990
What are you doing?

04:51.024 --> 04:53.526
I'll make it quick.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.062
Put that away.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.031
I'll scream!

04:58.064 --> 04:59.332
Who wouldn't?

04:59.367 --> 05:01.769
(grunting)
Please!

05:01.802 --> 05:04.437
Sorry, friend.
The boss wants you dead.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.005
Why?

05:06.038 --> 05:08.841
You know,
I never thought to ask.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.610
(shouts)

05:10.644 --> 05:13.447
(moaning)

05:13.480 --> 05:15.483
(thud)

05:19.586 --> 05:22.689
(wolf howling)

05:22.723 --> 05:24.824
*

06:12.906 --> 06:14.942
And everything went smoothly
with Mr. Worth?

06:14.975 --> 06:16.776
FAITH: Not if
you're Mr. Worth.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.612
(laughs)

06:18.646 --> 06:20.581
Well, that's swell.

06:20.613 --> 06:24.384
You know how I feel
about loose ends.

06:24.418 --> 06:27.555
And the big day is so close.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.891
You can smell
the excitement in the air.

06:30.923 --> 06:33.793
Say, are you ever coming out
of there?

06:33.826 --> 06:37.163
I don't know.
Oh, come on.

06:44.572 --> 06:48.742
Wow. Aren't you a vision.

06:48.776 --> 06:51.411
I feel wicked
stupid in this.

06:51.444 --> 06:55.716
You look lovely.
Perfect for the ascension.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.250
Any boys that manage
to survive

06:58.284 --> 07:00.120
will be lining up
to ask you out.

07:00.153 --> 07:04.423
It just isn't me though.
Not you?

07:04.458 --> 07:07.427
Let me tell you something.

07:07.461 --> 07:10.430
Nobody knows what you are.

07:11.964 --> 07:14.567
Not even you,
Little Miss Seen It All.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.437
The ascension
isn't just my day.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.007
It's yours, too.
Your day to blossom,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.744
show the world
what a powerful girl you are.

07:23.776 --> 07:27.113
I think
of what you've done,

07:27.146 --> 07:29.550
what I know you will do.

07:31.685 --> 07:35.322
No father could be prouder.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.992
I hope I don't let you down.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.994
Impossible.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.596
Now, come on, change back
into your street clothes.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.031
I'll buy you an ICEE.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.500
(chuckles)

07:48.968 --> 07:51.370
*

07:57.810 --> 08:01.113
Hey, Rosenberg.
Hey, Percy.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.517
Check it out.
History final.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.452
B-minus.
That's great!

08:06.485 --> 08:08.454
I'm a scholar.
I'm like a scholar.

08:08.487 --> 08:10.891
Congratulations.
(chuckles)
Hey, listen,

08:10.923 --> 08:14.293
thank you. I mean,
for helping me,

08:14.326 --> 08:16.196
being so patient.

08:16.228 --> 08:18.899
And also for not kicking my ass
like you did in the Bronze.

08:18.932 --> 08:23.502
You know, Percy,
that was actually...

08:23.536 --> 08:24.904
for your own good.

08:24.937 --> 08:27.240
I know. I know.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.009
Hey.
Hey.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.377
History's important,
you know.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.645
No, I totally
get that now.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.048
(sighs)
And I got the grades,

08:35.081 --> 08:36.716
and I'm graduating tomorrow.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.384
I can forget all this crap.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.155
Well, on the bright
side, after graduation,

08:43.190 --> 08:44.991
he may not have the
chance to forget it all.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.326
Ha-ha.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.062
I'm just trying to
keep things light.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.063
But things aren't light.

08:51.097 --> 08:53.500
I mean, it's bad enough
we have to fight the mayor.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.503
I don't want him eating Percy
and the whole class.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.506
We have to find a spell or
something to stop the ascension.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.775
Then we will.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.852
Thank you for joining
us, Mr. Harris.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.856
Look, I realize that you've
all finished your finals

09:16.889 --> 09:18.859
and you're ready
to move on.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.861
But you haven't graduated yet.

09:21.894 --> 09:26.265
This is still a class,
and everyone will participate.

09:26.298 --> 09:29.636
Mr. Harris,
would you care to begin?

09:29.669 --> 09:32.639
Um...

09:34.073 --> 09:35.709
"E."

09:35.743 --> 09:38.544
No. There's

09:38.577 --> 09:40.947
no "E."
(chuckles)

09:40.980 --> 09:43.750
They always go for the "E."

09:45.753 --> 09:48.120
Next.
Hi.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.557
Steven.
Hey.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.559
STEVEN:
Um, "L."
Um, so I was wondering,

09:53.592 --> 09:55.663
um, maybe if you were free
this weekend,

09:55.696 --> 09:57.898
maybe we could do
some...

09:57.931 --> 10:00.432
entertaining thing.

10:00.466 --> 10:03.336
Would that be along the lines
of you telling me

10:03.370 --> 10:05.337
about all the men you destroyed
back in your demon days?

10:05.371 --> 10:08.008
'Cause pencil me in.

10:09.308 --> 10:12.679
Well, we could do
something else you like.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.115
We could, um...

10:15.148 --> 10:18.951
watch sports
of some kind.

10:18.985 --> 10:22.088
Uh, I don't know.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.624
Men like sports. I'm sure of it.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.625
Yes.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.195
Men like sports.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.029
Men watch the action movie.

10:30.062 --> 10:33.365
They eat of the beef
and enjoy to look at the bosoms.

10:33.399 --> 10:35.134
1,000 years
of avenging our wrongs

10:35.168 --> 10:36.469
and that's all you've learned?

10:36.503 --> 10:37.837
Hey, I'm trying, okay?

10:37.870 --> 10:39.471
You don't need
to take my head off.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.610
I'm sorry.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.279
Look...

10:47.313 --> 10:50.482
I-I don't even know if I'm
gonna make it to next weekend.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.821
I'll tell you what, I
survive the ascension,

10:53.854 --> 10:56.956
and then maybe you and I could
do some sports-related...

10:56.990 --> 11:00.527
What?

11:00.559 --> 11:02.028
Faith.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.797
WESLEY:
You're sure?

11:03.831 --> 11:07.399
It's one of her pieces.
I recognize the brushwork.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.304
"Brutally stabbed...

11:12.339 --> 11:13.472
"Lester Worth,

11:13.505 --> 11:16.576
visiting professor
of geology."

11:16.609 --> 11:19.812
There's nothing in here
that bellows motive.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.849
Random killing,
perhaps? Fit of rage?

11:21.881 --> 11:24.183
Everybody does seem to be
going a bit mad lately.

11:24.216 --> 11:26.586
Faith has something
of a head start.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.322
Doesn't read.
I think it's homework.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.823
The mayor wanted
the good professor

11:30.857 --> 11:32.325
out of the way.
Which leads

11:32.359 --> 11:33.894
to the question, how come?

11:33.927 --> 11:35.729
"I'm gonna destroy
the entire city,

11:35.763 --> 11:38.398
but I take the time
to kill harmless Lester first?"
Tying up

11:38.431 --> 11:41.500
loose ends?
Lester had something

11:41.533 --> 11:44.071
or knew something.
Then I want to know, too.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.907
If the mayor's trying to hide,
I say we go seek.

11:46.940 --> 11:50.576
Ah. By attempting
to keep a valuable clue from us,

11:50.610 --> 11:54.313
the mayor may have inadvertently
led us right to it.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.717
What page are you on, Wes?
'Cause we already got there.

11:58.751 --> 12:00.953
Yes, well,

12:00.988 --> 12:03.722
you will go tonight,
look over his apartment.

12:03.756 --> 12:06.092
Anything of note,
report back here.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.796
I just love it when
you take charge, you man, you.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.530
(stammers)
Was that a yes?

12:11.563 --> 12:13.801
I'm having trouble
keeping track.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.402
I'll go.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.236
Be careful.

12:17.269 --> 12:20.072
If Faith
should show up...
I don't think she'll show.

12:20.106 --> 12:21.740
Been there,
killed that.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.409
She's not much
for follow-up.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.812
Nonetheless, keep watch.

12:24.845 --> 12:27.279
Faith has you
at a disadvantage, Buffy.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.116
'Cause I'm not crazy
or 'cause I don't kill people?

12:30.149 --> 12:31.918
Both, actually.

12:31.951 --> 12:34.486
I hear you.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.890
I can't kill her.
Fun as it may sound.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.726
I can make her cry uncle though,
and I mean to.

12:40.759 --> 12:44.230
Don't let your feelings about
Faith interfere with your work.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.067
Stopping Faith
 is my work.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.402
Take a beat
to love the synergy.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.004
Faith is a footnote.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.639
Our priority
is stopping the ascension.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.408
XANDER:
Easier said
than done,

12:55.442 --> 12:57.644
Monarchy Boy.
Xander,
if you don't have

12:57.677 --> 13:01.780
something constructive to add...
You guys want to know
about the ascension?

13:01.815 --> 13:06.253
Well, meet the only living
person who's ever been to one.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.089
About 800 years ago, in the
Koskov Valleys above the Urals,

13:09.121 --> 13:11.924
there was a sorcerer there
who achieved ascension.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.261
Became the embodiment
of the demon Lohesh.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.431
I was there cursing a shepherd
who'd been unfaithful.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.932
His wife had wished

13:19.966 --> 13:21.634
that all his sheep would lie...
Can we cut back

13:21.668 --> 13:22.501
to the chase?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.937
Oh. Sorry. Um...

13:24.971 --> 13:28.140
Lohesh was...

13:28.174 --> 13:31.879
It-it decimated
the village within hours.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.880
Maybe three
people got out.

13:33.913 --> 13:35.514
I've seen some
horrible things

13:35.548 --> 13:37.783
in my time.
I've... been the cause

13:37.817 --> 13:39.619
of most of them, actually,
but this...

13:39.652 --> 13:41.221
(clears throat)
I'm sorry. Uh, Lohesh was

13:41.254 --> 13:43.655
a four-winged soul killer,
am I right?

13:43.690 --> 13:46.125
I was given to
understand that

13:46.158 --> 13:48.695
they're not that fierce.
Of all the demons

13:48.727 --> 13:50.163
we've faced...
You've never seen

13:50.197 --> 13:51.798
a demon.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.033
Uh, excuse me.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.135
Killing them professionally,
four years running.

13:56.168 --> 13:59.172
All the demons that walk
the earth are tainted,

13:59.206 --> 14:00.807
are human hybrids,
like vampires.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.811
The ascension means
that a human becomes pure demon.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.546
They're different.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.480
Different?
How?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.017
Well, for
one thing,

14:10.049 --> 14:12.052
they're bigger.

14:12.085 --> 14:16.056
The kids are here, the parents
off to the side there.

14:16.088 --> 14:20.059
We'll go up,
they'll play the processional,

14:20.092 --> 14:22.229
and then you'll give
the address.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.063
It all looks wonderful.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.731
As long as nobody makes
any trouble.

14:25.764 --> 14:28.168
Oh, stop worrying. You just
make sure the kids show up.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.236
Anybody who doesn't feel
like coming to graduation,

14:30.269 --> 14:33.005
well, they'll just have
to live without a diploma.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.706
They'll be here, sir.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.176
Call me Richard.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.178
You've done
a great job here.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.613
I know things

14:40.647 --> 14:42.448
are, um...

14:42.481 --> 14:44.716
well, different
here in Sunnydale.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.452
We've both seen
all sorts of things.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.587
What's important is
that we keep it under control,

14:48.620 --> 14:49.855
and that's what you've done.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.292
I believe in order.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.293
Sunnydale owes you a debt.

14:54.326 --> 14:56.296
It will be repaid.

14:57.496 --> 14:59.731
Yes, sir.
We'll mark that invoice

14:59.765 --> 15:01.467
"paid in full."

15:01.500 --> 15:03.870
(crow cawing)

15:03.903 --> 15:05.538
It doesn't sound like
Lohesh. The rituals

15:05.572 --> 15:07.539
are all different.
GILES: I wish
that was a relief.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.043
OZ:
What's going on?
How come Evil Girl's

15:10.076 --> 15:12.111
in the mix?

15:12.144 --> 15:14.313
Um, Anya witnessed
an ascension.

15:14.346 --> 15:17.317
Oh. Okay then.

15:17.350 --> 15:18.817
BUFFY:
What about the spiders?
The mayor had a box

15:18.850 --> 15:20.486
of spiders that he had to eat.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.722
The box of...
I want to say Gravlocks?

15:23.755 --> 15:25.591
Gavrock.
It doesn't

15:25.625 --> 15:27.759
ring a bell.
Well, there
must be something

15:27.793 --> 15:29.328
that you can remember
that would be helpful.

15:29.361 --> 15:31.831
WILKINS:
So...

15:31.864 --> 15:34.866
this is the
inner sanctum.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.573
Faith tells me this is where
you folks like to hang out,

15:41.607 --> 15:43.610
concoct your little schemes.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.278
I'll tell you, you
know, it's just nice

15:45.312 --> 15:46.613
to see that some young people

15:46.645 --> 15:48.347
are still interested in reading

15:48.380 --> 15:49.915
in this
modern era.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.751
(chuckles)

15:52.784 --> 15:55.355
So, what are kids reading
nowadays?

15:56.389 --> 15:59.091
"The beast
will walk

15:59.125 --> 16:00.860
"upon the earth and
darkness will follow.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.796
"The several races of man
will be as one

16:03.830 --> 16:05.631
in their terror
and destruction."

16:05.664 --> 16:07.634
Aw, that's kind of sweet.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.336
Different races coming together.
You never get

16:10.370 --> 16:12.871
even a little tired of
hearing yourself speak, do you?

16:12.904 --> 16:14.874
(chuckles)

16:14.907 --> 16:17.943
That's one spunky
little girl you've raised.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.678
(chuckles)

16:19.711 --> 16:22.581
I'm gonna eat her.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
(grunts)

16:26.153 --> 16:27.953
(grunts, pants)

16:27.986 --> 16:30.157
Whoa!

16:30.190 --> 16:31.957
Well, now,

16:31.990 --> 16:33.725
that was a little thoughtless.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.395
(grunts)

16:36.428 --> 16:38.398
Violent outbursts like that,

16:38.431 --> 16:40.832
in front of the children.
You know, Mr. Giles,

16:40.866 --> 16:43.836
they look to you
to see how to behave.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.072
Get out.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.975
I smell fear.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.610
That's smart.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.149
Some of your deaths
will be quick,

16:56.182 --> 16:57.649
if that's
worth anything.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.652
Well,

16:59.686 --> 17:02.822
see you all at graduation.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.856
You don't want to miss
my commencement address.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.858
It's gonna be one...

17:07.894 --> 17:10.297
heck of a speech.

17:20.271 --> 17:23.242
(indistinct chatter)

17:23.276 --> 17:25.243
Anya, wait!

17:25.278 --> 17:27.380
Where you going?
Anywhere.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.016
If there's a lunar shuttle
going up anytime soon,

17:30.048 --> 17:31.351
I'm on it.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.751
We need you here.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.421
You might be able to help.

17:34.453 --> 17:36.423
Or I might be able to live.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.525
You can't stop the ascension,
Xander.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.126
You were right the first time.

17:40.160 --> 17:44.330
The only thing any sane
person can do now is run.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.968
What's her saga?
She's freakin'.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.306
About what?
The mayor is gonna kill us all
during graduation.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.907
Oh. Are you gonna go
to fifth period?

17:55.942 --> 17:57.109
I'm thinking I might skip it.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.112
Yeah Me, too.

18:01.913 --> 18:05.117
Buffy, I'm home.
Do you want to go to...

18:06.318 --> 18:08.488
What are you doing?

18:09.689 --> 18:13.292
You're running away again?

18:13.326 --> 18:16.296
And you're taking my clothes.
Mom, I need you
to leave town.

18:16.328 --> 18:17.797
Tonight.

18:17.829 --> 18:19.898
Buffy, I'd miss your graduation.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.901
Yeah, that's
sort of the idea.
There's no way.

18:21.933 --> 18:24.237
I wouldn't dream of it.
Mom, graduation is

18:24.270 --> 18:25.738
a pointless ceremony
where you sit around

18:25.771 --> 18:27.574
and listen to a bunch
of boring speeches

18:27.606 --> 18:28.974
till someone hands you
a piece of paper

18:29.008 --> 18:30.809
that says you graduated,
which you already know.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.578
And maroon does nothing
for my complexion,

18:32.612 --> 18:34.447
so don't argue, okay?
(scoffs)

18:34.480 --> 18:36.982
What, is some terrible demon
going to attack the school?

18:40.787 --> 18:43.990
Oh, I see.

18:44.022 --> 18:46.092
Oh, you know, Buffy,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.661
looking back
at everything that's happened,

18:48.694 --> 18:51.998
maybe I should have sent you
to a different school.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.000
Just promise me that
you'll be far away from here.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.502
I am not leaving you
to face an awful monster.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.305
If I go anywhere,
you're going with me.
You know

18:58.337 --> 18:59.939
that I can't.
Well, then I can't

18:59.971 --> 19:02.942
either.
(sighs)

19:02.974 --> 19:06.045
Mom, I know that sometimes
you wish I were different.

19:06.077 --> 19:08.047
Buffy, no...
I wish I could be
a lot of things

19:08.079 --> 19:10.482
for you-- a great student,

19:10.517 --> 19:13.653
a star athlete, remotely normal.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.021
I'm not.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.958
But there is something I do
that I can do better

19:18.990 --> 19:20.960
than anybody else in the world.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.795
I'm gonna fight this thing.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.231
But I can't do it
and worry about you.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.366
Buffy, I just can't...
You stay,

19:27.400 --> 19:29.336
you'll get me killed.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.805
You have
to trust me on this.

19:32.838 --> 19:35.375
Can you do that?

19:40.011 --> 19:42.382
(squeaking)

19:45.050 --> 19:48.654
(groans)
This is so frustrating.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.324
Nothing useful?

19:51.357 --> 19:53.326
No, it's great.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.328
If we want to make
ferns invisible

19:56.363 --> 19:57.896
or communicate
with shrimp,

19:57.930 --> 20:00.666
I've got the goods
right here.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.903
Our lives are different
than other people's.

20:03.935 --> 20:06.172
(groans)
Who am I kidding?

20:06.204 --> 20:09.008
I'm not gonna find a spell
to stop the ascension.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.742
I'm no witch.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.580
I can't even change
poor Amy back to a person.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.583
(squeaking)

20:16.615 --> 20:19.419
But you got
the swinging Habitrail goin'.

20:19.451 --> 20:21.921
I think Amy's
in a good place emotionally.

20:21.953 --> 20:24.723
(scoffs)
Oz...

20:24.757 --> 20:26.593
What?

20:26.625 --> 20:31.130
Could you just pretend to care
about what's happening, please?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.566
You think I don't care?

20:33.599 --> 20:35.567
I think we could be dead
in two days' time,

20:35.602 --> 20:39.105
and you're being
Ironic Detachment Guy.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.606
Would it help you if I panic?

20:40.640 --> 20:43.041
Yes! I-It'd be swell.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.612
Panic is a thing people
can share in times of crisis,

20:45.644 --> 20:48.615
and-and everything's
really scary now, you know?

20:48.647 --> 20:51.550
And I don't know what's gonna
happen. And-and there's

20:51.584 --> 20:53.452
all sorts of things that
you're supposed to get to do

20:53.486 --> 20:55.721
after high school,
and I was really looking forward

20:55.755 --> 20:58.625
to doing them. And-and now
we're probably just gonna die,

20:58.657 --> 20:59.791
and I'd like to feel
that maybe you would...

21:05.664 --> 21:08.067
What are you doing?

21:08.099 --> 21:09.669
Panicking.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.669
Ow.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.971
Stealthy.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.375
Not my best entrance.

21:48.407 --> 21:50.175
I think they were moppin'
in the halls.

21:50.209 --> 21:53.011
What are you doing here?

21:53.045 --> 21:55.114
I checked in with Giles.

21:55.146 --> 21:57.115
He asked me to back you up.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.117
He's afraid
I'll run into Faith.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.619
And you're not?

22:00.653 --> 22:03.655
It's gonna happen sooner
or later.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.625
What's that?

22:05.657 --> 22:09.862
A report,
excavation of some old lava bed.

22:09.895 --> 22:13.732
The guy was a volcano-ologist
or something.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.001
Anything in there
that connects him to the mayor?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.003
I looked through it,
but the only thing

22:18.037 --> 22:20.507
I understood were the commas.
I'm gonna...

22:20.539 --> 22:23.442
bring it to Giles,
see if he can do better.
Let me give you a hand.

22:36.455 --> 22:39.258
You know what? Thank you,
but I-I can take it from here.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.259
It's all right.
I'll walk you there.

22:41.292 --> 22:43.529
Look, I don't
need an escort.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.932
I'm a big girl.
Superpowers, remember?

22:46.965 --> 22:49.602
I don't need you crowding me.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.538
I didn't think I was.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.705
No, of course you don't.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.207
You just show up
at the prom,

22:55.240 --> 22:56.942
and then you disappear
into the ozone.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.377
For all I know,
you left town.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.212
Are you mad at me
for being around too much

23:01.247 --> 23:03.015
or for not
being around enough?

23:03.048 --> 23:04.717
Duh. Yes.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.352
Which?
What?

23:06.384 --> 23:07.753
I don't get you.

23:07.787 --> 23:10.189
(sighs) No, you
don't. Not anymore.

23:10.221 --> 23:13.259
Are you just making this harder
to make this easier on yourself?

23:13.291 --> 23:16.261
(sighs)
Can we stop
with the brainteasers?

23:16.295 --> 23:19.531
I just wish it was over, done.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.367
It's not that simple.
Once the mayor...
I know.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.369
World in peril
and we have to work together.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.740
This is my last office romance,
I'll tell you that.

23:27.773 --> 23:29.375
You want me out of your face?

23:29.407 --> 23:32.711
Isn't it even a
little hard for you?

23:32.744 --> 23:34.780
How can you ask me that?
Just 'cause I'm not acting

23:34.814 --> 23:36.281
like a brat doesn't mean
I don't feel anything.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.750
It's nice to know
what you think of me.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.118
What do you expect me to say
when you just attack?

23:40.152 --> 23:42.989
I just can't do this anymore.
I can't have you in my life

23:43.021 --> 23:44.256
when I'm trying to move...

23:44.289 --> 23:45.892
(grunts)

23:45.924 --> 23:49.127
(panting, grunting)

23:49.161 --> 23:51.663
Angel!

23:56.702 --> 23:59.171
Missed the heart.

23:59.204 --> 24:02.107
Meant to.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.646
(grunting)

24:07.680 --> 24:09.848
Okay, ready?

24:09.882 --> 24:11.116
Yeah.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.117
On three.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.853
One...

24:13.885 --> 24:16.756
(groans) I knew
you were gonna do that.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.625
GILES: Not too much blood here.
I heal pretty fast.
I should be all right.

24:19.659 --> 24:23.362
I'm just glad Faith's
such a suck shot.

24:23.394 --> 24:27.365
We're sure it was her?
Well, I've narrowed down
my list of one suspect.

24:27.398 --> 24:31.604
Fascinating.
What?

24:31.637 --> 24:33.839
WESLEY:
It seems our Mr. Worth
headed an expedition

24:33.873 --> 24:36.776
in Kauai,
digging through old lava beds

24:36.808 --> 24:39.511
near a dormant volcano.

24:39.546 --> 24:40.880
I'm not fascinated yet.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.848
He found something
underneath.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.383
A carcass,

24:44.415 --> 24:46.685
buried by an eruption.
GILES:
A carcass?

24:46.719 --> 24:49.689
A very large one.
Mr. Worth posits

24:49.721 --> 24:52.825
that it might be some heretofore
undiscovered dinosaur.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.528
A demon?
Yes, that would be something

24:56.563 --> 24:58.297
that, uh, the mayor
would want to keep a secret.

24:58.329 --> 24:59.965
If it's the same kind
of demon he's turning into

24:59.999 --> 25:01.800
and it's dead,
then it means that,

25:01.834 --> 25:04.903
well, he's only impervious
to harm until the ascension.

25:04.936 --> 25:08.207
In this demon form,
he can be killed.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.210
Great. So all we need is a
million tons of burning lava.

25:11.242 --> 25:14.212
We're saved.
Well, it's a start, a-anyway.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.414
Okay, you have been
a real klutz today.

25:16.448 --> 25:18.349
You need to...

25:18.384 --> 25:20.819
Damn.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.253
(panting)

25:26.525 --> 25:28.493
We'll have to run some tests.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.496
ANGEL:
My shoulder's
completely numb.

25:30.528 --> 25:33.164
You're burning up.
It's poison.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.267
I can feel it.

25:35.300 --> 25:38.704
I'll call the others,
get them here.

25:38.738 --> 25:42.107
We'll need to move him
to the safety of his own bed

25:42.141 --> 25:43.675
before the sun comes up.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.277
Will you be able
to find out what this is?

25:45.310 --> 25:47.246
WESLEY:
The council has all
the known toxins

25:47.278 --> 25:49.181
on file, mystical or otherwise.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.916
I'll contact them immediately.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.219
Thanks.

25:58.790 --> 26:00.660
You're gonna be okay.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.969
(squeaking)

26:27.586 --> 26:31.123
I feel different, you know?

26:31.156 --> 26:34.125
But I guess that makes sense.

26:34.160 --> 26:37.730
Do you feel different?
Oh, no, you've already...

26:37.763 --> 26:41.067
Probably no big change
for you.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.469
I-It w... it was nice.

26:43.501 --> 26:45.471
Was it nice?

26:45.503 --> 26:48.307
Should this be
a quiet moment?

26:48.339 --> 26:51.343
I know exactly what you mean.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.814
Which part?

26:54.846 --> 26:58.284
Everything feels different.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.594
(telephone rings)

27:08.626 --> 27:11.596
(groans softly)

27:11.630 --> 27:14.032
Hello?

27:16.301 --> 27:18.470
We got to go.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.307
He's dropped, boss.

27:21.339 --> 27:23.710
Applause, applause.
Right in the back.

27:23.742 --> 27:25.711
He pitches over
and Buffy's freakin',

27:25.744 --> 27:28.180
looking around, all panicked.
It was a good time.

27:28.213 --> 27:30.382
Well, that should keep
her occupied for a spell.

27:30.415 --> 27:31.951
What next?

27:31.983 --> 27:34.119
(sighs)
The ritual

27:34.153 --> 27:36.521
of Gavrock. I have to ingest

27:36.555 --> 27:39.391
several of the inhabitants
of this box.

27:39.424 --> 27:40.392
Ingest?

27:40.425 --> 27:42.193
Eat.

27:43.229 --> 27:45.197
You're wicked gross.

27:45.230 --> 27:47.298
(chuckles)
Well, you don't have to watch.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.968
Just, you know, go home,
take it easy.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.802
It's a big day tomorrow.
You got

27:50.836 --> 27:52.805
to give me something to do.
There's no way I'm sleeping.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.707
Don't you need anyone
dead or maimed?

27:54.740 --> 27:56.307
I could settle
for maimed.

27:56.342 --> 27:58.044
(chuckles)
You little firecracker.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.913
My mom used to call me that.

28:00.946 --> 28:03.315
When I was little.

28:03.348 --> 28:06.417
I was always running around...

28:07.953 --> 28:11.356
Uh, tomorrow,
the ascension and all that,

28:11.390 --> 28:12.991
am I gonna get
to fight?

28:13.025 --> 28:15.493
If everything goes smoothly,
you won't have to.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.829
But how often
do things go smoothly?

28:17.864 --> 28:19.999
So you'll still need me
in there.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.666
Always.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.069
When I was a kid,

28:24.103 --> 28:26.838
a couple of miles outside of
Boston, there was this quarry,

28:26.873 --> 28:30.342
and all the kids used to swim
there and jump off the rocks.

28:30.375 --> 28:33.011
And there was this one rock,
like, 40 feet up.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.413
I was the only one
that would jump off of it.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.017
All the older kids
were too scared.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.550
Not you though.

28:39.585 --> 28:44.155
Nah. I could do it easy.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.625
Get some rest.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.964
Good luck with your spiders
there.

29:00.405 --> 29:04.109
They should have all this
at the magic shop.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.378
I can run a trace analysis,
see if it's a mystical poison.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.381
I'm a little short
on cash.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.584
Just tell 'em it's for me.
Right.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.160
ANYA:
Xander.

29:23.162 --> 29:25.897
What are you doing here?

29:25.932 --> 29:28.067
I thought you'd be
in Aruba by now.

29:28.099 --> 29:31.069
Hey, I'm packed. My
car's right outside.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.305
I-I just, um...

29:33.338 --> 29:36.142
I, uh... I
had to, uh...

29:36.174 --> 29:38.144
What?

29:38.176 --> 29:39.979
(sighs)

29:40.011 --> 29:42.748
You could
come with me.

29:42.780 --> 29:44.583
Come with you?

29:44.615 --> 29:46.684
You mean that?

29:46.718 --> 29:48.287
Why not?

29:48.319 --> 29:51.022
We could just... get in the car
and drive.

29:51.057 --> 29:54.993
And no one would miss us.
We could...

29:55.027 --> 29:57.462
take turns
driving,

29:57.496 --> 30:00.098
keep each other awake.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.535
You're going to die
if you stay here.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.472
I guess I might.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.875
When I think that something
could happen to you,

30:09.909 --> 30:11.643
it feels bad inside,

30:11.676 --> 30:13.644
like I might vomit.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.047
(chuckles)

30:15.080 --> 30:17.148
Welcome to the world of romance.

30:17.182 --> 30:20.685
It's horrible! No wonder
I used to get so much work.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.689
Well, I'm sorry
I give you barfy feelings.

30:23.721 --> 30:25.790
(sighs)

30:25.824 --> 30:27.726
Come with me.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.131
I can't.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.365
Why not?

30:34.400 --> 30:37.368
I got friends on the line.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.971
So?

30:39.005 --> 30:41.707
That humanity thing's

30:41.740 --> 30:43.741
still a work in progress,
isn't it?

30:43.775 --> 30:45.344
Are you really gonna be
that much help to them?

30:45.376 --> 30:47.246
I mean, you'll
probably just get in the way.

30:47.278 --> 30:50.182
Your stock's plummeting here,
sweetheart.

30:50.215 --> 30:52.584
Fine. You know what?
I hope you die.

30:54.853 --> 30:58.223
Aren't we gonna kiss?

30:58.257 --> 31:00.893
(owl hooting)

31:07.598 --> 31:09.768
(groans)

31:18.477 --> 31:20.711
(groans softly)

31:20.746 --> 31:23.048
(gasps)

31:23.082 --> 31:25.917
It'll be okay.

31:26.919 --> 31:29.820
You'll be okay.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.992
(door opens)
(groans)

31:34.993 --> 31:37.395
(grunting)

31:43.970 --> 31:46.137
GILES:
Did you reach

31:46.172 --> 31:47.673
the council?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.210
WESLEY:
Y-Yes.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.311
They...

31:53.345 --> 31:57.115
they couldn't help.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.218
Couldn't?

31:59.250 --> 32:01.619
Wouldn't.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.155
It's not council policy
to cure vampires.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.657
Did you explain that these were
special circumstances?
Not under

32:06.692 --> 32:09.060
any circumstances. And, yes,
I did try to convince them.

32:09.095 --> 32:10.962
Try again.

32:10.997 --> 32:13.398
Buffy, they're very firm.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.900
We're-we're talking about laws

32:14.932 --> 32:17.068
which have existed longer
than civilization.

32:17.103 --> 32:20.638
I'm talking
about watching my lover die.

32:20.672 --> 32:23.342
I don't have
a clue what

32:23.375 --> 32:26.144
you're talking about,
and I don't care.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.946
Buffy, we'll find a cure.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.182
The Council's
orders

32:30.215 --> 32:32.718
are to concentrate
on the...
Orders?

32:36.954 --> 32:40.326
I don't think I'm gonna be
taking any more orders.

32:42.294 --> 32:45.096
Not from you. Not from them.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.200
You can't turn your back
on the council.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.136
They're in England.
I don't think

32:51.170 --> 32:53.372
they can tell
which way my back is facing.

32:53.404 --> 32:55.874
Giles, talk to her.

32:55.906 --> 33:00.046
I have nothing to say right now.

33:01.547 --> 33:02.980
Wesley, go back to your council

33:03.015 --> 33:04.115
and tell them until
Don't you see what...

33:04.150 --> 33:05.683
the next slayer
comes along,

33:05.717 --> 33:08.186
they can
close up shop.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.355
I'm not working
for them anymore.

33:10.388 --> 33:12.691
Don't you see what's happening?

33:12.723 --> 33:15.361
Faith poisoned Angel
to distract you,

33:15.394 --> 33:18.564
to-to keep you out of the
mayor's way. And it's working.

33:18.596 --> 33:20.665
We need a strategy.
I have

33:20.699 --> 33:22.067
a strategy.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.568
You're not in it.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.772
This is mutiny.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.614
I like to think of it
as graduation.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.588
Giles, I can't stay
here any longer.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.423
I'm gonna go see if
I can help the others.
Of course.

33:45.457 --> 33:47.093
You'll watch him?

33:47.125 --> 33:49.228
I'll call
if there's any change.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.565
Buffy...

33:53.598 --> 33:56.268
you don't know
what you're doing.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.738
Get a job.

34:02.374 --> 34:04.509
(door opens)

34:04.542 --> 34:06.944
(door shuts)

34:10.815 --> 34:13.552
Finding the poison
wasn't that hard.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.387
It's a mystical compound.

34:15.420 --> 34:18.389
The Latin name translates
roughly to "killer of the dead."

34:18.422 --> 34:21.626
Used on vampires.
And the cure?

34:21.659 --> 34:25.697
There aren't a lot of
instances of it being cured.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.099
But there are some?
One or two.

34:28.134 --> 34:30.101
Pretty vague accounts.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.838
How is he?

34:34.505 --> 34:35.974
Hold it.

34:36.007 --> 34:36.974
You got something?

34:37.007 --> 34:38.043
I'm not sure.

34:38.076 --> 34:39.311
Be sure.
Okay.

34:39.344 --> 34:40.311
"Killer of the dead."

34:40.346 --> 34:41.980
That's our boy, and...

34:42.012 --> 34:43.748
here's a vamp that
walked away from it.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.751
Does it talk about the cure?

34:45.784 --> 34:48.152
Damn.

34:48.186 --> 34:50.422
Nothing?
No, it's

34:50.456 --> 34:52.056
in here, but...

34:52.090 --> 34:55.126
Wait. "Completely
reversed the effects."

34:55.161 --> 34:57.295
Oh.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.496
What?
XANDER:
Come on, guys.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.398
The suspense is killing Angel.

35:00.431 --> 35:04.235
Th-The only way to cure
this thing

35:04.269 --> 35:07.105
is to drain the blood
of a slayer.

35:15.112 --> 35:17.081
Good.

35:17.114 --> 35:19.251
Good? What did I miss?

35:19.284 --> 35:21.487
No,
it's perfect.

35:21.519 --> 35:25.157
Angel needs to drain a slayer,
then I'll bring him one.

35:25.190 --> 35:27.159
WILLOW:
Buffy, if Angel
drains Faith's blood,

35:27.193 --> 35:28.860
it'll kill her.

35:28.893 --> 35:31.730
Not if she's already dead.

35:39.737 --> 35:41.873
A leasing agreement.
Should be recent.

35:41.907 --> 35:43.708
Won't be in her name, but
if the mayor's putting her up,

35:43.742 --> 35:46.545
it might be in his.
Maybe he's charging it
to the city.

35:46.577 --> 35:49.981
Right. Cross-reference
realty with municipal funds.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.882
You want to drive?

35:51.916 --> 35:54.186
Sorry.

35:56.722 --> 35:58.523
BUFFY:
 Someone should take over
 for Giles after a while,

35:58.556 --> 35:59.990
watch Angel.

36:00.025 --> 36:01.726
I don't mean to play
devil's advocate here,

36:01.760 --> 36:03.329
but are you sure
you're up for this?

36:03.362 --> 36:04.896
It's time.

36:04.929 --> 36:07.565
(sighs)
We're talking
to the death.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.835
I can't play
kid games anymore.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.237
This is how she wants it.

36:12.271 --> 36:15.072
I just don't
want to lose you.

36:15.106 --> 36:16.541
I won't get hurt.

36:16.574 --> 36:19.545
That's not what I mean.

36:19.577 --> 36:22.547
Just get me an address.

36:31.188 --> 36:34.559
(grunting)

36:34.592 --> 36:37.027
(sniffles)

36:40.030 --> 36:42.400
(groaning)

36:45.804 --> 36:48.206
(grunting)

36:49.608 --> 36:51.976
(panting)

36:58.048 --> 36:59.851
(beep)

36:59.885 --> 37:02.721
I got it.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.389
* He said he likes it

37:04.422 --> 37:07.224
* Come on, baby,
hear the heels click-clack *

37:07.259 --> 37:10.628
* Oh, I see you walking
in the street, you know *

37:10.661 --> 37:13.197
* He likes it, he likes it

37:13.231 --> 37:16.134
* He's so right

37:16.166 --> 37:19.570
* Left out of it, left in tune

37:19.605 --> 37:22.807
* And I strum, strum, strum.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.242
(music stops)

37:26.244 --> 37:29.146
Thought I'd stop by.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.318
Is he dead yet?

37:33.351 --> 37:35.052
He's not gonna die.

37:35.085 --> 37:38.657
It was a good try though.
Your plan?

37:38.690 --> 37:41.059
Uh-huh. Mayor got me
the poison.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.561
He said it was wicked painful.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.563
There's a cure.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.798
Damn. What is it?

37:47.833 --> 37:49.534
Your blood.

37:52.137 --> 37:55.507
As justice goes, it's not
unpoetic, don't you think?

37:55.541 --> 37:57.675
Come to get me?

37:57.708 --> 37:59.644
You gonna feed me
to Angel?

37:59.677 --> 38:03.315
You know
you're not gonna take me alive.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.949
Not a problem.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.952
Well, look at you,

38:06.985 --> 38:09.987
all dressed up
in big sister's clothes.

38:10.021 --> 38:13.659
You told me I was just like you.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.797
That I was holding it in.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.132
Ready to cut loose?

38:22.166 --> 38:24.335
Try me.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.338
Okay then.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.476
Give us a kiss.

38:32.010 --> 38:35.146
(grunting)

38:38.483 --> 38:40.719
(grunting)

39:12.016 --> 39:14.251
(grunting)

39:27.032 --> 39:29.333
You're not getting tired,
are you? I'm just starting
to feel it.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.536
(grunting)

39:52.891 --> 39:54.224
(panting)

39:54.259 --> 39:54.893
Stick around.

39:56.393 --> 39:57.728
(grunting)

39:57.762 --> 39:59.565
Buffy...

39:59.597 --> 40:02.000
(panting)

40:08.239 --> 40:10.608
Right. Right.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.445
Something about the demon?

40:14.480 --> 40:16.447
The, uh, local villagers
near the volcano site

40:16.481 --> 40:19.451
make reference
to the legend of Olukai.

40:19.485 --> 40:22.119
Might be a bastardization
of Olvikan.

40:22.152 --> 40:24.054
Who's Olvikan?

40:24.088 --> 40:26.056
I know it's a demon,
a very old one.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.893
I might have a picture.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.393
Boy, it's a good thing
no one ever wanted

40:29.427 --> 40:31.396
to check any of
these books out, huh?

40:31.429 --> 40:33.130
Yes, very convenient.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.000
Come on, Olvikan.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.505
Hey.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.947
We're gonna need
a bigger boat.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.347
(crunching)

40:50.380 --> 40:53.985
Mmm...

40:59.990 --> 41:01.827
Mmm.

41:04.461 --> 41:07.331
My God, what a feeling.

41:07.364 --> 41:10.536
The power of these creatures...

41:10.568 --> 41:13.170
it suffuses my being.

41:13.204 --> 41:16.507
(growling)
Mmm.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.344
I can feel the changes begin.

41:19.376 --> 41:21.146
My organs

41:21.179 --> 41:22.813
are shifting, merging,

41:22.847 --> 41:25.382
making ready for the ascension.

41:25.416 --> 41:27.719
Plus, these babies
are high in fiber.

41:27.753 --> 41:29.721
And what's the fun
in becoming an immortal demon

41:29.755 --> 41:31.657
if you're not regular,
am I right?
(door opens)

41:32.690 --> 41:34.826
We don't knock

41:34.860 --> 41:37.795
during dark rituals?
Sir,
there may be trouble.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.429
At Faith's.

41:42.568 --> 41:45.003
(grunting)

42:03.554 --> 42:05.356
What's the matter,
all that killing

42:05.389 --> 42:07.157
and you're afraid to die?

42:07.192 --> 42:09.894
(grunting)

42:16.034 --> 42:18.637
(panting)

42:20.905 --> 42:22.039
That's mine.

42:22.072 --> 42:24.074
You're about to get it back.

42:24.108 --> 42:25.876
(grunting)

42:31.449 --> 42:33.751
(panting)

42:34.952 --> 42:37.722
Man, I'm gonna
miss this.

42:37.755 --> 42:38.789
(whimpers, grunts)

42:38.824 --> 42:41.893
(grunts)
(panting)

42:43.260 --> 42:45.597
(grunting)

42:45.630 --> 42:47.766
(panting)

42:49.567 --> 42:52.938
(weakly):
You did it.

42:54.940 --> 42:56.907
(grunts)

43:02.480 --> 43:06.150
(panting)
You killed me.

43:16.327 --> 43:19.931
Still won't help your boy
though.

43:22.599 --> 43:24.001
Should've been there, B.

43:28.005 --> 43:31.342
Quite a ride.

44:33.905 --> 44:36.373
Grr. Argh.
