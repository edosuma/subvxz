(Crows cawing)

00:04.731 --> 00:05.779
<i>(Frankie) Halloween...</i>

00:05.898 --> 00:07.460
<i>the most terrifying time of the year,</i>

00:07.564 --> 00:10.198
<i>where frightening horrors</i>
<i>lurk around every corner.</i>

00:10.579 --> 00:12.191
I got my learners permit!

00:12.343 --> 00:13.823
Aah!

00:14.050 --> 00:16.847
I'm 18!
I get to pick the president!

00:16.979 --> 00:18.281
Aah!

00:18.426 --> 00:20.356
I signed you up
to work at the Halloween fair.

00:20.452 --> 00:22.576
Aah!

00:22.922 --> 00:26.206
Brick, why would you
volunteer me at school?

00:26.310 --> 00:29.153
You know the line...
"sorry, my mom works long hours.

00:29.273 --> 00:31.234
We hardly ever see her."
I made you memorize it.

00:31.235 --> 00:34.075
Well, I thought it was okay since
you're not working now. (Door opens)

00:34.076 --> 00:36.156
You didn't tell people that, did you?
(Door closes)

00:36.157 --> 00:37.637
(Sighs) If they know I'm not working,

00:37.638 --> 00:39.038
I'm gonna get calls for everything.

00:39.059 --> 00:41.074
Mike, do not answer the phone.

00:41.202 --> 00:42.004
Never do.

00:42.135 --> 00:43.553
(Sue) Maintaining safe speed.

00:43.684 --> 00:45.817
(Gasps) Uh-oh.
Obstruction in the road.

00:45.956 --> 00:48.507
Checking mirrors.
Applying brake.

00:48.634 --> 00:49.616
Beep!

00:52.988 --> 00:54.427
Checking mirrors.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.016
Re-entering traffic.

00:56.134 --> 00:57.599
Enough practicing, Sue!

00:57.724 --> 00:59.644
You're gonna have to learn
to drive a real car.

00:59.741 --> 01:01.101
I'm not driving you around forever

01:01.102 --> 01:02.211
listening to one direction.

01:02.321 --> 01:04.161
I'm starting to <i>like</i>
a couple of those songs.

01:04.162 --> 01:05.477
You guys...

01:07.574 --> 01:09.080
after my near-death experience

01:09.178 --> 01:10.867
accidentally driving the Donahues' car,

01:11.034 --> 01:12.652
I am not getting behind the wheel again

01:12.758 --> 01:15.822
until I feel completely prepared
for any situation.

01:15.990 --> 01:18.250
(Door closes)
Hey, Sue. Just a heads up,

01:18.377 --> 01:20.314
traffic in the family room is horrible.

01:20.607 --> 01:21.525
Good tip.

01:21.695 --> 01:23.037
I'll take the hallway.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.489
<i>(Man's voice moans
diabolically)</i> Hey, Brick,

01:25.498 --> 01:27.378
what's this I got
in the mail that you didn't?

01:27.516 --> 01:29.387
(Gasps) Oh!
It's a voter guide,

01:29.500 --> 01:31.566
sent personally to me, Axl Redford Heck,

01:31.567 --> 01:33.567
signifying my readiness
to take my rightful place

01:33.683 --> 01:34.526
among the adult,

01:34.538 --> 01:36.298
president-choosing citizens
of our country.

01:36.625 --> 01:38.410
Do you even know who you're voting for?

01:38.600 --> 01:40.400
Not yet. I'll wait
till I hear 'em all sing,

01:40.401 --> 01:41.681
and then I'll text in my choice.

01:41.684 --> 01:43.497
Good idea. Your vote
shouldn't count anyway.

01:46.821 --> 01:48.142
(Clinks)

01:48.831 --> 01:50.436
Eh, good enough.

01:52.629 --> 01:54.005
Hi, Frankie!

01:54.199 --> 01:57.123
I see a happy Halloween in your future!

01:57.228 --> 01:58.939
Oh, Nancy, you look great!

01:59.061 --> 02:00.098
Oh, thanks.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.021
I saw it in a catalog, sewed it myself,

02:02.155 --> 02:03.906
and saved 14 bucks.

02:04.199 --> 02:06.112
And you look...

02:06.429 --> 02:07.869
Well, I already got halfway dressed,

02:07.870 --> 02:09.630
and I couldn't find
the rest of my costume,

02:09.721 --> 02:12.095
so, yep. I'm raggedy mouse.

02:12.253 --> 02:13.081
(Laughs) (Clinks)

02:13.179 --> 02:15.669
I think it's fantastic.
Very creative.

02:15.833 --> 02:17.192
(Girl) Thank you!

02:17.611 --> 02:20.660
You know, I cannot get it up
for Halloween this year.

02:20.781 --> 02:23.299
I think losing my job
and starting school...

02:23.449 --> 02:25.472
it just all feels like too much.

02:25.607 --> 02:27.447
I'm supposed to take Brick
trick-or-treating.

02:27.448 --> 02:28.768
I just want to open a box of wine

02:28.769 --> 02:30.092
and stay home.

02:30.226 --> 02:31.541
Oh, I'll take him for you.

02:31.739 --> 02:33.359
I'm taking Dottie and Shelly already,

02:33.480 --> 02:35.635
so it would be no trouble
to have Brick come along.

02:35.817 --> 02:37.865
Oh, really? I could
pawn him off on you?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.591
You don't think that makes me a bad mom?

02:39.592 --> 02:42.312
I don't think <i>that</i> does, no.

02:44.624 --> 02:46.696
We're not exactly
moving a lot of fish here.

02:46.810 --> 02:48.545
What happens to all the leftovers?

02:50.399 --> 02:51.398
I know times are tough,

02:51.528 --> 02:53.617
but I'm not eating goldfish for dinner.

02:53.730 --> 02:56.823
Well, apparently, fish mom
gets to bring home the fish.

02:56.995 --> 02:58.715
Mm. Fish mom should take 'em
down the hall

02:58.796 --> 03:00.105
to porcelain pond.

03:00.254 --> 03:01.303
(Laughs)

03:01.639 --> 03:02.519
<i>(Crowd cheering on TV)</i>

03:02.520 --> 03:04.800
Check me out. Just read
this whole book, cover to cover.

03:04.904 --> 03:07.735
Wow. First "Cat In The Hat,"
and now this.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.174
Hey, you told me to get informed.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.826
But this is, like, way harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

03:11.953 --> 03:14.460
Seriously, sheriff?
(Chuckles) How do you pick?

03:14.592 --> 03:17.320
I like this guy 'cause
he's serious about crime.

03:17.499 --> 03:20.201
But then this other guy's
gonna get tough on crime.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.746
(Inhales sharply, blows raspberry)

03:21.766 --> 03:23.406
What sheriff are you guys gonna vote for?

03:23.700 --> 03:26.466
Uh, we haven't really
made up our minds yet.

03:26.599 --> 03:27.777
What about the city council?

03:27.942 --> 03:30.573
You liking Paul Delvecchio
or Jennifer Farley?

03:31.295 --> 03:33.473
Yeah, I'm leaning toward Delvecchio.

03:33.605 --> 03:35.005
Oh, are you?
Are you really?

03:35.124 --> 03:36.964
'Cause they're both people
from Jersey Shore.

03:37.091 --> 03:39.011
You guys haven't even
looked at this, have you?

03:39.278 --> 03:42.067
Okay, so maybe we don't always
vote for the little offices,

03:42.196 --> 03:45.016
but we vote for the big guys,
like president.

03:45.204 --> 03:46.546
You know, maybe it's a good thing

03:46.679 --> 03:48.852
that he's studying up on the sheriffs.

03:48.968 --> 03:50.328
He's never gonna meet a president,

03:50.329 --> 03:53.744
but I bet money you're gonna
run into a sheriff some day.

03:54.251 --> 03:56.235
Might want to take a look
at those judges, too.

03:56.752 --> 03:58.569
You two are what's wrong with America.

03:59.243 --> 04:00.217
(Both exhale)

04:01.238 --> 04:02.352
Maybe he's right.

04:02.551 --> 04:03.786
Mom, dad,

04:03.953 --> 04:06.163
I have done a lot of driving practice,

04:06.279 --> 04:09.219
and I think I am finally ready
to take the next step.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.132
Finally. About time
you get out there and...

04:11.133 --> 04:12.192
Picking a keychain!

04:12.341 --> 04:14.221
(Keychains jangle)
Which one do you guys like?

04:14.316 --> 04:15.956
I've been collecting them over the years,

04:15.957 --> 04:18.317
and now that I'm gonna drive,
it's finally time to choose.

04:18.470 --> 04:20.637
This one's "one direction."
"I 'heart' New York."

04:20.765 --> 04:22.814
I've got, like, four "Brown County" ones.

04:22.973 --> 04:25.558
(Gasps) This one says
"I'm going commando."

04:25.684 --> 04:28.444
I don't really get it,
but I do support the military.

04:28.952 --> 04:29.438
(Sighs)

04:29.439 --> 04:31.239
Why don't you take the one
shaped like a key

04:31.364 --> 04:32.653
and put it in the ignition?

04:33.211 --> 04:34.748
I just want to be prepared.

04:34.891 --> 04:35.887
I'm not ready.

04:36.071 --> 04:39.225
I can't even narrow my keychains
down to a top three.

04:39.392 --> 04:41.870
Sue, you are ready.

04:42.006 --> 04:44.366
Remember when you didn't want
to take your training wheels

04:44.367 --> 04:45.607
off your bike, and we made you?

04:45.608 --> 04:46.511
What happened then?

04:46.634 --> 04:47.286
(Gasps)

04:47.390 --> 04:48.378
Oh, my God.

04:48.483 --> 04:52.420
This situation is very similar
to <i>that</i> situation.

04:53.036 --> 04:54.545
I <i>can</i> do this.

04:54.671 --> 04:57.791
(Gasps) I am gonna go drive a car.

04:57.959 --> 04:59.132
(High-pitched voice)
Aah ha!

04:59.223 --> 05:00.783
(Normal voice) I'll be waiting outside.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.399
(Keychains jangle, door opens)

05:02.974 --> 05:04.042
Oh, no.
(Door closes)

05:04.082 --> 05:06.402
You're the one that gave
the great speech. Get out there.

05:06.535 --> 05:07.793
Rock paper scissors?

05:10.658 --> 05:12.683
I worked the fish booth.
Have fun.

05:13.051 --> 05:13.818
(Grunts)

05:21.401 --> 05:22.843
I thought mom was coming with me.

05:22.984 --> 05:24.794
Well, we rock-paper-scissored
for it.

05:24.901 --> 05:26.059
And you won?

05:26.284 --> 05:27.841
Sure.
Let's go with that.

05:28.056 --> 05:29.616
Okay. Start her up.
(Seat belt clicks)

05:29.617 --> 05:30.283
(Exhales deeply)

05:31.439 --> 05:32.233
(Engine starts)

05:32.340 --> 05:33.462
Aah!

05:33.954 --> 05:35.291
Okay. Now put it
in reverse.

05:35.394 --> 05:37.887
Dad, hold on. I have to
go through my checklist first.

05:38.912 --> 05:40.761
Mirrors... check.

05:40.964 --> 05:41.759
Signal...

05:41.876 --> 05:43.002
(Click) Check.

05:43.363 --> 05:44.591
(Click) Wipers...

05:44.800 --> 05:46.122
(Whirs)

05:46.513 --> 05:47.552
Check.

05:47.665 --> 05:48.905
How are the weather conditions?

05:49.631 --> 05:51.052
We're not flying
cross-country.

05:51.165 --> 05:52.325
We're going around the block.

05:52.326 --> 05:53.431
This is my process.

05:54.677 --> 05:56.796
Hands at 10:00 and 2:00...
Check.

05:57.019 --> 05:57.889
(Exhales)

05:58.126 --> 06:01.280
Dad, I saw that.
You're making me nervous.

06:01.388 --> 06:03.108
I don't want you
looking at me. Look away.

06:03.151 --> 06:03.951
What?

06:04.061 --> 06:05.308
Look away.

06:07.634 --> 06:09.163
Is the brake in the right position?

06:09.343 --> 06:11.326
How am I supposed to tell
when I'm looking away?

06:11.453 --> 06:13.441
Okay, you can look, and then look away.

06:13.512 --> 06:14.472
Okay, Sue, this is nuts.

06:14.473 --> 06:16.233
You do realize
when you're out on the road,

06:16.234 --> 06:17.834
other drivers are gonna be watching you?

06:17.835 --> 06:20.275
That's the deal with driving.
Everybody looks at each other.

06:20.276 --> 06:22.836
I just want to be prepared for
every single possible situation.

06:22.837 --> 06:25.077
There's a million unpredictable
things that can happen.

06:25.078 --> 06:26.438
Well, now you're making me scared.

06:26.439 --> 06:28.699
Well, don't be. When you drive,
you have to be confident.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.500
You can't just tell someone
to <i>be</i> confident!

06:30.501 --> 06:32.621
Okay, enough. Let's go.
You're gonna run out of gas.

06:32.622 --> 06:34.622
Okay, let me just run
through my checklist first.

06:34.657 --> 06:35.577
No, no more checklists.

06:35.578 --> 06:37.258
Just go. Come on.
Pull out now. Pull out.

06:37.259 --> 06:37.779
(Gears grind)

06:37.780 --> 06:39.340
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Aah!

06:39.354 --> 06:40.314
The car's already going!

06:40.315 --> 06:41.715
I'm s... it's...
I just thought...

06:41.742 --> 06:43.963
- (Crying) Aah!
- Okay... mm.

06:44.092 --> 06:45.890
I'm never driving with you again!

06:47.118 --> 06:48.791
Wha...
(Seat belt whirs)

06:52.883 --> 06:53.807
(Door closes)

06:54.543 --> 06:56.661
<i>So the next day, we tried it again</i>

06:56.773 --> 06:58.435
<i>with a gentler approach.</i>

06:59.013 --> 07:00.893
Can I go over my checklist?
(Seat belt clicks)

07:00.894 --> 07:02.816
Sure, honey, that's a great idea.

07:02.931 --> 07:04.854
Whatever makes you comfortable.

07:05.377 --> 07:07.456
Brakes... check.

07:08.192 --> 07:09.283
Mirrors...

07:09.497 --> 07:10.447
Check.

07:10.707 --> 07:11.787
Signals...
(Click)

07:11.968 --> 07:12.924
Check.

07:13.048 --> 07:14.661
This is gonna be fun, huh?

07:14.810 --> 07:17.772
A couple of chicks out driving
like "Thelma & Louise."

07:17.985 --> 07:20.396
I mean the beginning of that movie, but...

07:20.749 --> 07:22.788
You know what?
Don't see it.

07:22.992 --> 07:25.298
All right, then.
Here we go.

07:25.604 --> 07:27.329
Why don't you start the car?

07:29.857 --> 07:31.330
(Engine starts)

07:32.132 --> 07:33.322
(Exhales deeply)

07:33.467 --> 07:35.537
Now you're gonna want
to shift into reverse.

07:35.662 --> 07:37.567
Stop rushing me!

07:37.758 --> 07:39.246
(Crying) Oh, my God!

07:39.369 --> 07:40.885
You're worse than dad!
(Gasps)

07:41.022 --> 07:42.413
Honey.
(Door thuds)

07:43.089 --> 07:44.170
(Seat belt clicks) Ugh!

07:44.372 --> 07:45.711
(Cries) Honey!

07:46.276 --> 07:47.207
Ugh.
(Door closes)

07:55.143 --> 07:56.116
(Doorbell rings)

07:56.233 --> 07:58.021
<i>So I couldn't teach my daughter to drive,</i>

07:58.194 --> 08:01.063
<i>and I let my neighbor take</i>
<i>my son trick-or-treating.</i>

08:01.513 --> 08:03.649
<i>But Halloween wasn't a complete bust.</i>

08:03.766 --> 08:05.526
(Children, singsong voices)
Trick or treat!

08:05.527 --> 08:06.527
There you go.

08:06.988 --> 08:07.840
Thanks.

08:08.069 --> 08:09.680
Yeah. Thanks.

08:09.928 --> 08:10.751
(Mouths words)

08:16.710 --> 08:17.904
(Sighs)

08:18.666 --> 08:19.824
(Door opens)

08:19.940 --> 08:20.898
Hey, mom.

08:21.014 --> 08:22.134
(High-pitched voice)
Whoop.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.978
Hey, Brick.
You're back already, huh?

08:24.107 --> 08:25.043
How was it?

08:25.235 --> 08:26.037
Awesome.

08:26.146 --> 08:28.304
Mrs. Donahue brought
thermoses of apple cider,

08:28.447 --> 08:30.452
and then she took us to Orson Heights.

08:30.568 --> 08:32.520
Everyone was giving out
full-sized candy bars,

08:32.645 --> 08:33.842
and the houses are huge.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.703
Have you ever considered moving there?

08:35.852 --> 08:37.253
Come on. Unload the loot.

08:37.385 --> 08:39.340
Mama's jonesing for a Kit Kat.

08:40.097 --> 08:41.097
<i>(TV playing indistinctly)</i>

08:44.235 --> 08:45.317
Whoa.

08:45.861 --> 08:49.619
Brick, that is a buttload of candy.

08:49.732 --> 08:50.700
I know.

08:50.842 --> 08:52.060
By my calculations,

08:52.212 --> 08:54.182
I should have enough
to eat a piece every day

08:54.303 --> 08:55.892
for the next year and a half.

08:55.998 --> 08:59.695
(Mouth full) Oh, but you are not
eating all this candy.

08:59.895 --> 09:01.606
Okay, tell you what...
we'll make a deal.

09:01.738 --> 09:03.035
You can eat as much as you want

09:03.155 --> 09:04.366
for the next 24 hours,

09:04.533 --> 09:07.205
and then we're sending the rest
to the soldiers overseas.

09:07.323 --> 09:09.088
- Hmm?
- (Exhales) Fine.

09:09.197 --> 09:10.833
All right? Come on.
Time for bed.

09:11.451 --> 09:12.519
(Dog barks in distance)

09:19.840 --> 09:21.969
<i>So another Halloween had come and gone,</i>

09:22.167 --> 09:24.299
<i>and I, for one, was relieved.</i>

09:24.486 --> 09:26.913
Mom, I did it.
I completed your challenge.

09:27.079 --> 09:28.809
Challenge? What challenge?

09:28.950 --> 09:30.539
I ate all my candy in 24 hours,

09:30.658 --> 09:31.722
just like you said.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.922
You told him to eat all his candy?

09:41.042 --> 09:41.811
No!

09:41.918 --> 09:43.038
You said I had to finish it.

09:43.077 --> 09:44.597
No, I didn't!

09:44.843 --> 09:48.212
(Scoffs) I thought he would
eat some, get sick,

09:48.328 --> 09:49.564
and not want the rest.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.561
You know, like when
someone starts smoking,

09:51.686 --> 09:54.591
and you... you force them to smoke
an entire carton of cigarettes.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.844
Not really helping your case
for mother of the year.

09:56.845 --> 09:57.448
(Sighs)

09:58.087 --> 09:59.848
How in the world could you possibly

09:59.971 --> 10:01.305
have eaten all that candy?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.453
(Whirring)

10:16.440 --> 10:18.251
It wasn't easy, but I powered through.

10:18.373 --> 10:20.122
There's nothing left?

10:20.243 --> 10:21.932
Not even a tootsie roll?

10:22.098 --> 10:23.583
You know, for the soldiers.

10:23.763 --> 10:25.264
I'm actually not feeling too well.

10:25.446 --> 10:26.846
If I still feel like this tomorrow,

10:26.944 --> 10:28.255
can I stay home from school?

10:28.406 --> 10:29.806
(Scoffs) You're not skipping school

10:29.807 --> 10:31.607
'cause your mom made you eat
a ton of candy.

10:31.608 --> 10:33.865
And don't you dare say that at school.

10:33.983 --> 10:35.419
We're already in the system.

10:36.337 --> 10:37.150
Come on, mom.

10:37.265 --> 10:38.764
I'm leaving the driveway this time.

10:38.867 --> 10:39.890
I can feel it.

10:40.663 --> 10:41.828
(Sighs) (Sighs)

10:48.683 --> 10:50.244
- What's this?
- Check it out.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.744
This guy's running for city council.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.063
His name's Harry Butts.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.571
(Laughs) Like, seriously.
It's his real name.

10:58.018 --> 10:59.948
How could we not
put this sign up? Right?

11:00.061 --> 11:01.861
I mean you get why
that's funny, right, dad?

11:01.998 --> 11:04.278
(Car engine starts) Yeah, I
think I can crack that code.

11:04.279 --> 11:04.999
(Sue) I am calm...

11:05.595 --> 11:07.443
confident, and in control.
(Snickers)

11:07.564 --> 11:08.637
I am ready!

11:09.006 --> 11:10.038
I am not ready.

11:10.422 --> 11:11.142
What's the holdup?

11:11.218 --> 11:12.528
She says she's not ready.

11:12.680 --> 11:14.238
Come on, Sue. You can do it.
Just go.

11:14.309 --> 11:16.149
I will. I just need
to do my checklist first.

11:16.150 --> 11:17.774
- Go!
- Oh, stop it, Axl!

11:17.903 --> 11:18.630
Honey, come on.

11:18.750 --> 11:19.990
- I will. I will.
- All right.

11:20.077 --> 11:22.251
- Just put it in gear.
- (Mike) Come on.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.801
If you just do it, it's
gonna get easier every time.

11:24.802 --> 11:25.482
This is annoying!

11:25.532 --> 11:26.559
- Okay!
- There you go.

11:26.560 --> 11:27.760
That's it. Ease out.
(Crunch)

11:27.761 --> 11:29.521
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, hey! You're on his foot!

11:29.522 --> 11:30.242
- Aah!
- Back up!

11:30.293 --> 11:30.973
Stop! Stop! Stop!

11:30.974 --> 11:32.454
Put it in gear!
Keep going! Back up!

11:32.455 --> 11:33.749
Move it forward!
What are you doing?!

11:33.750 --> 11:35.830
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Is it "stop" or is it "go"?

11:35.831 --> 11:37.739
- Go forward! Go one way or the other!
- Move! Move!

11:37.837 --> 11:39.780
- You're on his foot!
- Go! Get it off of my foot!

11:39.781 --> 11:41.101
Just let me do
my checklist! Oh!

11:41.102 --> 11:42.862
- (Frankie) Sue, just get out.
- Come here.

11:42.863 --> 11:44.183
(Axl) My foot! Sue!
(Sue crying)

11:44.184 --> 11:45.424
- Aah!
- Oh, my God! Hurry up!

11:45.425 --> 11:46.897
Oh! Oh.

11:47.449 --> 11:49.296
Oh. Aah.

11:49.413 --> 11:52.049
(Crying) I told you I wasn't ready.

Person on crutches coming through.

12:05.450 --> 12:06.751
Oh, does it hurt?

12:06.882 --> 12:08.774
Let's see.
I had a car on my foot.

12:08.874 --> 12:10.094
Yeah. It hurts.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.667
Is he gonna be able to play football?

12:12.802 --> 12:14.687
Not for a while.
Lucky it's just a sprain.

12:14.688 --> 12:16.288
Doctors said if he would have broken it,

12:16.289 --> 12:18.169
he'd have been out
for the rest of the season.

12:18.209 --> 12:20.049
Which would have meant
good-bye, scholarship.

12:20.050 --> 12:20.210
Ugh.

12:20.473 --> 12:21.583
Hey, Axl,

12:21.989 --> 12:23.272
I just wanted to say...

12:23.403 --> 12:24.311
Get her out!

12:25.342 --> 12:27.211
I just wanted to say I am so stupid.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.619
Get her out!
(Thud)

12:29.809 --> 12:31.829
- Oh.
- What?

12:32.669 --> 12:35.114
<i>I'd been dreading the fallout</i>
<i>from Brick's candy binge,</i>

12:35.255 --> 12:38.145
<i>and as sure as you can say</i>
<i>"creamy nougat caramel center,"</i>

12:38.337 --> 12:39.505
<i>the call came.</i>
(Beep)

12:39.616 --> 12:40.899
Well, that was the school.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.922
Brick's teacher wants to see us.

12:43.044 --> 12:44.343
(Sighs) Great.

12:44.481 --> 12:46.598
I forced him to go to school
after Halloween,

12:46.717 --> 12:47.705
and he probably threw up

12:47.827 --> 12:49.776
and told everyone I made him
eat all his candy.

12:49.984 --> 12:51.622
(Axl) I'm out of chips!
(Clicks)

12:51.734 --> 12:53.271
Not now, Axl!

12:53.397 --> 12:55.397
Oh, God, and we'd made it
all the way to November

12:55.398 --> 12:57.198
without getting a call
from Brick's teacher.

12:57.199 --> 12:58.359
That was a new record for us.

12:58.479 --> 13:00.374
(Singsongy) Hello! Chips!

13:00.487 --> 13:02.287
Well, someone's
gonna have to go down there.

13:02.437 --> 13:05.094
<i>Somebody?</i> You're the one
who challenged Brick

13:05.222 --> 13:06.483
to eat 20 pounds of candy.

13:06.627 --> 13:08.094
It wasn't a challenge.

13:08.210 --> 13:09.557
Chips!
(Clanging)

13:10.729 --> 13:11.721
Okay.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.698
One, two...

13:13.833 --> 13:15.158
Fine. I'm going.

13:18.895 --> 13:22.676
You probably have an idea
of why I called you in.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.153
I might.

13:24.284 --> 13:27.733
You see, Brick came in
the day after Halloween...

13:27.734 --> 13:29.174
Okay, I don't know what he told you,

13:29.175 --> 13:29.895
but I can explain.

13:30.033 --> 13:31.833
I wasn't even there.
Somebody else took him.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.114
Gave him this huge pillowcase...

13:33.137 --> 13:35.012
He's been <i>great.</i>

13:35.230 --> 13:37.360
What? He has?

13:37.514 --> 13:39.737
Let me tell you a little about myself.

13:39.839 --> 13:44.436
I am the type of person
who likes things a certain way.

13:44.597 --> 13:49.234
I have no use
for outside-the-box thinking.

13:49.435 --> 13:50.838
Needless to say,

13:51.169 --> 13:54.349
I have not been a big fan of Brick.

13:54.477 --> 13:57.021
Yeah, he's pretty far outside that box.

13:57.158 --> 14:00.102
But since the day after Halloween,

14:00.283 --> 14:02.635
Brick has been a <i>dream.</i>

14:02.807 --> 14:06.599
All his whispering and whooping gone.

14:06.795 --> 14:07.886
(Laughs) Wow.

14:08.099 --> 14:09.625
You know, when you called me in here,

14:09.763 --> 14:10.824
I thought...

14:11.536 --> 14:13.341
You know what?
I interrupted you.

14:13.462 --> 14:14.364
Go on.

14:14.505 --> 14:18.401
Has Brick been put
on any medication recently?

14:18.735 --> 14:21.135
Sort... of?

14:21.271 --> 14:23.694
Don't need to know.
Just more paperwork.

14:23.828 --> 14:27.337
The point is, whatever you're doing,

14:27.878 --> 14:29.070
keep it up.

14:31.201 --> 14:33.084
Okay, here's what I'm thinking...

14:33.245 --> 14:35.538
a cupcake for breakfast,
twinkies for lunch,

14:35.691 --> 14:36.611
and we sneak some M&M's

14:36.755 --> 14:38.213
into his hamburger meat at dinner.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.502
He's not a dog, Frankie.
(Door opens and closes)

14:41.915 --> 14:44.724
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.
How was work today, dad?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.048
Uh... fine.

14:47.884 --> 14:50.370
Would you like to hear
about my day? It was great.

14:50.486 --> 14:52.566
I played some four square
with some kids at recess,

14:52.632 --> 14:54.422
and then we shot some hoops after school.

14:54.889 --> 14:56.569
Anyways, I'm gonna go pick up my room now.

14:56.685 --> 14:58.865
If you guys wanna do
anything later, let me know.

15:01.490 --> 15:04.050
Wouldn't want to leave this out
where someone could trip on it.

15:04.656 --> 15:06.118
(Dog barks in distance)

15:06.924 --> 15:08.484
That kid has a year and a half of candy

15:08.611 --> 15:11.176
- coursing through his veins.
- He's more sugar than boy.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.201
But it's made him... normal.

15:13.389 --> 15:16.869
I'm telling you, we have
stumbled onto something here.

15:16.990 --> 15:20.117
It's like "Lorenzo's oil."
People should know about this.

15:20.257 --> 15:22.836
Frankie, nobody <i>ever</i>
needs to know about this.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.511
(Sighs)

15:32.136 --> 15:33.476
<i>Brick might have been on a high,</i>

15:33.604 --> 15:35.190
<i>but Sue was on a low.</i>

15:35.326 --> 15:38.347
<i>With one disastrous car ride,</i>
<i>Sue managed to not only put</i>

15:38.515 --> 15:40.298
<i>Axl's football career in jeopardy,</i>

15:40.450 --> 15:42.691
<i>but also Orson High's perfect record.</i>

whistle blows)

15:45.755 --> 15:47.858
<i>(Man over PA) Touchdown, warriors.</i>

15:48.808 --> 15:50.448
You know who would have stopped that guy?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.165
- Axl.
- Yeah, he would have.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.865
I can't believe his stupid
sister ran over his foot.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.397
I didn't even know he had a sister.

15:56.461 --> 15:58.061
How do you even run over someone's foot?

15:58.138 --> 16:00.710
If we lose this game tonight,
it is all her fault!

16:01.254 --> 16:03.409
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened.

16:03.544 --> 16:04.584
- I know!
- Totally!

16:04.720 --> 16:06.480
This doesn't just ruin his life!

16:06.632 --> 16:07.919
Now she ruined the whole school!

That's a great choice.
(Clatter)

16:52.467 --> 16:54.128
Hey, you know, I can carry that stuff.

16:54.324 --> 16:55.441
It'd be no problem.

16:55.593 --> 16:56.873
Haven't you done enough already?

16:56.991 --> 16:58.431
First, you knock me out of football,

16:58.432 --> 17:01.387
now you gotta brag about
how you're able to carry stuff?

17:01.828 --> 17:02.407
No.

17:02.536 --> 17:04.615
I mean, I can carry it <i>for you.</i>

17:05.344 --> 17:06.275
Oh.

17:06.578 --> 17:07.430
Look, Axl,

17:07.544 --> 17:09.064
I know how much football means to you,

17:09.180 --> 17:11.345
and I would never do
<i>anything</i> to ruin that,

17:11.346 --> 17:13.306
or your chance of getting
a college scholarship.

17:13.452 --> 17:16.412
I am <i>so</i> very sorry,

17:16.569 --> 17:19.419
very, very, very sorry
for spraining your foot.

17:19.553 --> 17:20.667
I mean, if I could go back

17:20.803 --> 17:22.695
a-and run over
my own foot with the car,

17:22.696 --> 17:24.777
I would, but I don't think
it's physically possible

17:24.832 --> 17:26.192
to do that from the driver's seat.

17:26.309 --> 17:27.992
Well, if anyone could do it, you could.

17:32.016 --> 17:34.295
Wait. Did you vote
for Harry Butts today?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.017
No, I'm gonna do it tomorrow.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.696
But today is election day.

17:39.441 --> 17:40.680
It's only one day?

17:41.728 --> 17:42.753
Damn it!

17:43.231 --> 17:45.151
How am I supposed to
get to the election place?

17:45.152 --> 17:46.552
I can't drive, and nobody's home!

17:48.768 --> 17:50.286
(Under breath) Oh.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.223
(Normal voice)
Fine. You can take me.

17:54.354 --> 17:56.132
What?! I can't do that!

17:56.261 --> 17:58.295
- Hey, you owe me this.
- But I can't.

17:58.464 --> 18:00.760
I am a danger to everyone on the road...

18:00.889 --> 18:02.127
even near the road.

18:02.251 --> 18:03.683
Look, this is important.

18:03.852 --> 18:06.132
My whole life, people have been
telling me what to do...

18:06.133 --> 18:08.072
"Sit up straight!"
"That cup's not a toilet!"

18:08.211 --> 18:09.163
"Clean your room!"

18:09.282 --> 18:11.326
Well, now I finally have a say.

18:11.462 --> 18:12.493
Now...

18:12.799 --> 18:14.914
I get to tell America to clean its room.

18:15.117 --> 18:16.117
(Slaps pamphlet on table)

18:16.118 --> 18:18.414
But I'm scared.
What if I mess up again?

18:18.550 --> 18:21.439
Sue, let me tell you why I'm so awesome.

18:21.629 --> 18:24.240
You see, even when I have
no idea what I'm doing,

18:24.370 --> 18:26.817
I pretend I do. That's why
I'm good at everything.

18:26.986 --> 18:29.861
This guy Harry Butts...
He should be living in a hole.

18:29.987 --> 18:30.747
But he has the guts

18:30.777 --> 18:32.338
to put his name on signs all over town

18:32.436 --> 18:33.996
and run for office.
If he can do that,

18:34.127 --> 18:35.807
then you gotta step it up and get me there

18:35.957 --> 18:37.178
so I can vote for him.

18:37.728 --> 18:39.239
Do it for America!

18:39.381 --> 18:41.003
I just love America so much.

18:42.149 --> 18:43.595
I'll do it!

18:44.741 --> 18:46.537
But wait...
I need an adult in the car.

18:47.302 --> 18:49.323
Voting is a big responsibility.

18:49.454 --> 18:51.481
That's why I'm voting for Truman.

18:52.317 --> 18:53.799
I'm driving!

18:53.936 --> 18:55.973
Oh, good, then I'm not.

18:56.446 --> 18:57.773
(Liquid sloshes)

19:00.971 --> 19:03.437
So Mr. Walker was teaching
a lesson on fractions

19:03.616 --> 19:06.117
and stopped to ask if everyone understood.

19:06.463 --> 19:07.790
And then I said,

19:08.053 --> 19:10.482
"I think we get about 3/4
of what you're saying,

19:10.623 --> 19:12.567
maybe 7/8."
(Frankie and Mike laugh)

19:13.306 --> 19:15.473
Yeah, everyone had
a good laugh at that one,

19:15.603 --> 19:16.931
even Mr. Walker.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.805
Oh, can I take your plates to the kitchen?

19:19.386 --> 19:20.890
- Oh, uh, sure.
- Sure.

19:24.975 --> 19:27.788
Wow. He's great, isn't he?

19:27.907 --> 19:29.825
I know.
(Water running in faucet)

19:29.826 --> 19:30.866
It's weird, though, right?

19:30.989 --> 19:32.252
Oh, my God. It's so weird.

19:32.396 --> 19:33.836
I mean, he's engaged and connecting,

19:33.837 --> 19:36.431
but without his quirks,
he's just not Brick.

19:36.724 --> 19:38.544
Oh, one more thing.

19:38.682 --> 19:40.082
There's a permission slip in the...

19:40.426 --> 19:41.934
(Thud)

19:45.244 --> 19:47.423
Hey, buddy. You okay?

19:48.152 --> 19:49.926
Can someone bring me a book?

19:51.563 --> 19:54.629
Brick, you said something
about a permission slip?

19:56.173 --> 19:58.028
If people are allergic to bees,

19:58.165 --> 20:00.258
can bees be allergic to people?

20:00.412 --> 20:01.543
(High-pitched voice)
Whoop!

20:03.393 --> 20:05.037
Maybe we can give him a little sugar,

20:05.164 --> 20:06.552
on special occasions.

20:06.687 --> 20:08.717
Like SATs or college interviews?

20:08.872 --> 20:10.556
- School dances?
- Oh, that's a good one.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.100
(Indistinct conversations)

20:13.217 --> 20:14.873
Where's the girl with the bathing suits

20:14.996 --> 20:16.828
I wanted to try on?

20:17.023 --> 20:17.821
(Curtain swishes)

20:17.934 --> 20:19.423
Democracy rules!

20:19.871 --> 20:20.970
Give me my sticker.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.720
<i>But the most important vote</i>
<i>that Axl cast that day</i>

20:23.847 --> 20:26.434
<i>was the vote of confidence in his sister.</i>

20:26.638 --> 20:28.278
I did my checklist while you were voting,

20:28.362 --> 20:29.923
so we are ready to roll.

20:30.430 --> 20:31.121
(Chuckles)

20:31.227 --> 20:32.141
Here.

20:32.401 --> 20:34.179
<i>So Axl had forgiven Sue...</i>

20:34.430 --> 20:35.322
<i>sort of.</i>

20:35.479 --> 20:36.952
<i>And sugar-free Brick</i>
<i>was a lot more</i>

20:37.063 --> 20:38.492
<i>like the one we were used to.</i>

20:38.622 --> 20:39.964
<i>Yep, it looked like things</i>

20:40.099 --> 20:41.958
<i>might just be getting back to normal.</i>

20:42.462 --> 20:44.445
(Telephone ringing)

20:44.549 --> 20:45.743
Brick?

20:46.059 --> 20:47.148
You gonna get the...

20:47.295 --> 20:48.047
(Ring)

20:48.144 --> 20:50.094
Never mind.
(Beeps)

20:50.375 --> 20:51.583
Hello?

20:51.813 --> 20:53.503
Yeah, this is Axl's mom.

20:55.188 --> 20:57.561
Oh. Uh-huh?

20:58.404 --> 21:00.231
Oh, no. Really?

21:01.016 --> 21:02.076
It's the doctor.

21:02.211 --> 21:03.623
He showed the film to a specialist.

21:03.742 --> 21:05.343
Axl's foot isn't sprained.

21:06.121 --> 21:07.256
It's broken.

21:07.753 --> 21:08.776
<i>Like I said...</i>

21:08.933 --> 21:10.218
<i>(Thunderclap)</i>

21:10.344 --> 21:12.370
<i>It's a scary time of year.</i>

21:12.475 --> 21:14.662
(Axl) Aah!

21:15.930 --> 21:20.514
