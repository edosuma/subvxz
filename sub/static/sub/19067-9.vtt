[snoring]

01:09.111 --> 01:10.153
[gasps]

01:12.155 --> 01:13.365
[resumes snoring]

01:13.448 --> 01:14.533
What? What'd I miss?

01:14.616 --> 01:18.120
Oh, nothing important. We've just
figured out a way to defeat Zarkon.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.080
Really? I dozed for ten minutes,

01:20.163 --> 01:22.499
and you guys figured out
how to defeat the forces of evil?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.584
You've been asleep for three hours.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.591
I think we've got something here.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.636
It's dangerous
and there are a lot of moving parts,

01:34.720 --> 01:37.180
but if we can coordinate
everything just right, then--

01:37.264 --> 01:39.558
Zarkon's reign will be at an end,

01:39.641 --> 01:43.353
and the savagery that's poisoned
our universe can finally be cleansed.

01:44.021 --> 01:47.107
-You've done it, Shiro.
-We did it together.

01:50.902 --> 01:54.072
As long as we all stick to the plan,
it should work.

01:54.156 --> 01:59.828
It will work. Perhaps, then, you'll learn
that not all Galra are as bad as Zarkon.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.207
I hope not.

02:06.585 --> 02:09.253
[Antok]
Ulaz was right to trust you all.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.840
He sacrificed everything
to bring us together.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.509
Let's honor him
by taking down Zarkon.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.847
-[Hunk] So, what's the plan?
-The plan is amazing!

02:18.930 --> 02:21.808
First, we infect Zarkon's ship
with a virus.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.396
Then, we make an extra-large wormhole
and lure Zarkon inside of it,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.732
zapping him a bajillion light-years away.

02:30.359 --> 02:34.821
Then, when he pops out on the other side,
all like, "Oh, why doesn't my ship work?"

02:34.905 --> 02:36.490
Voltron kicks his butt!

02:36.573 --> 02:39.910
Pew, pew, pew!
Womp, womp, womp! Huh! Hi-yah!

02:39.993 --> 02:41.286
[deep voice]
"I'll form the head!"

02:41.370 --> 02:42.996
[normal voice]
That's what you say, Shiro.

02:43.080 --> 02:47.084
Yeah, yeah. Yeah! We won for all time!

02:47.167 --> 02:50.337
Wow. So, this is it.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.056
I guess the only question is,
when do we strike?

03:01.890 --> 03:05.977
As soon as we build a teludav
big enough to wormhole Zarkon's ship.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.398
Oh, man. The teludav again?
Does that mean we need more scaultrite?

03:09.481 --> 03:12.067
That's just one
of the many things we'll need.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.654
Am I, uh... Am I sensing a trip
back to the space mall here?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.406
[Coran]
I'm afraid not.

03:17.489 --> 03:21.243
This is gonna take a lot more scaultrite
than we can find at any Unilu shop.

03:21.326 --> 03:25.705
For this plan to succeed, we're gonna need
to split up. We all have a task to do.

03:26.081 --> 03:29.251
<i>Keith, Hunk, you'll be in charge</i>
<i>of getting the scaultrite.</i>

03:29.334 --> 03:32.879
<i>If any one of us fails,</i>
<i>the entire plan fails.</i>

03:53.942 --> 03:55.652
[mouse squeaking]

03:57.529 --> 04:00.031
So, how about a kiss for good luck?

04:00.115 --> 04:01.658
[smacking lips, moaning]

04:09.291 --> 04:10.333
[muffled scream]

04:19.885 --> 04:21.636
Don't worry, we'll see each other soon.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.097
Take care, Coran.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.142
Stay safe, Princess.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.807
[grunts]

05:09.017 --> 05:10.519
Did you sense the lion?

05:11.061 --> 05:13.522
[groans]
Nothing.

05:14.105 --> 05:19.611
-It is wise that you rest.
-I will find that lion.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.156
Begin the process again.

05:32.582 --> 05:35.210
<i>Why does Allura get to take</i>
<i>a leisurely visit to the Balmera</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:39.256
while we have to fly into the belly
of a giant space worm to get scaultrite?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.425
You heard Coran.
Building a huge teludav isn't easy.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.594
Everyone has a job to do
and this is ours.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.054
But I always get the worst jobs.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.723
Go to a Galra-occupied planet
to get my lion.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.934
Go to a Galra-occupied Balmera
to get a crystal.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.937
Go into a belly of a beast
with the only Galra alien team member.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.021
I'm not an alien.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.567
Well, you're kind of an alien.
You're way more alien than me.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.777
You're at least some alien.
I'm-I'm none alien.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.655
[sighs]
Let's just concentrate on the job here.

06:05.448 --> 06:09.494
Yeah. Was-Was your mom the alien?
Your grandpa? How Galra are you?

06:09.578 --> 06:10.662
I don't know.

06:10.745 --> 06:14.332
Did the Blade of Marmora, like, teach you
the secret handshake, or something?

06:14.416 --> 06:17.335
No. No one said anything.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.797
The Blade of Marmora...
They're real tight-lipped, aren't they?

06:20.880 --> 06:23.592
I get that your society is secret,
but is everything a secret?

06:23.675 --> 06:28.263
Okay, look, it's bad enough that Allura
hates me now. Can you just lay off?

06:28.346 --> 06:30.223
Allura doesn't hate you.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.226
You just need to give her time
to accept the fact that you're Galra,

06:33.310 --> 06:36.021
the race that destroyed her entire planet
and all of her people.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.398
Yeah, she might hate you a little bit.

06:39.024 --> 06:42.027
Let's just watch the video
Coran uploaded and stay on task.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.070
We need to find out
how to collect this stuff.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.576
<i>Hello, brave Altean.</i>

06:50.160 --> 06:53.079
No way. Is that Coran?

06:53.163 --> 06:56.499
<i>So, you're about to go into the belly</i>
<i>of a weblum to harvest scaultrite.</i>

06:56.583 --> 06:58.084
<i>Good for you!</i>

06:58.168 --> 06:59.919
<i>Scaultrite is an important substance,</i>

07:00.003 --> 07:02.881
<i>with thousands of commercial</i>
<i>and industrial uses,</i>

07:02.964 --> 07:05.258
<i>including fabrication foam,</i>

07:05.342 --> 07:07.677
<i>insect night vision goggles, teludav--</i>

07:08.803 --> 07:10.597
Uh...

07:10.680 --> 07:13.850
<i>...anti-fungal klanm√ºirl lotion</i>
<i>and other such lubricants.</i>

07:13.934 --> 07:15.644
What's wrong with the video?

07:15.727 --> 07:18.021
It's ten thousand years old.
It's probably corroded.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.108
<i>I could go on for days.</i>

07:22.192 --> 07:26.029
<i>But you've got a weblum to enter</i>
<i>and some scaultrite to collect.</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:29.532
<i>Oh, look! There's a weblum now.</i>
<i>Hello, big fella!</i>

07:29.616 --> 07:34.663
<i>Hey, Coran! I'm off to eat some planets.</i>
<i>There's one now!</i>

07:34.746 --> 07:37.290
<i>-Nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum!</i>
<i>-We'll see you soon!</i>

07:37.374 --> 07:40.752
<i>As you probably remember from school,</i>
<i>the weblum is an enormous creature</i>

07:40.835 --> 07:43.755
<i>and an integral part</i>
<i>of keeping our universe functioning.</i>

07:43.838 --> 07:45.465
<i>It survives off of the--</i>

07:45.548 --> 07:47.008
<i>...left over from dead planets.</i>

07:47.092 --> 07:50.345
<i>It then reconverts</i>
<i>the quintessence remnants by--</i>

07:50.428 --> 07:53.181
<i>...becoming the building blocks</i>
<i>of new solar systems.</i>

07:53.264 --> 07:54.766
<i>Incredible, isn't it?</i>

07:54.849 --> 07:57.227
[both whimpering nervously]

07:57.727 --> 08:00.188
<i>Of course, these are no gentle giants.</i>

08:00.271 --> 08:02.565
<i>They're actually giants</i>
<i>that are quite deadly,</i>

08:02.649 --> 08:04.776
<i>which leads to rule number one.</i>

08:04.859 --> 08:07.112
<i>It's an important one, so listen closely.</i>

08:07.195 --> 08:09.114
<i>Stay away from its--</i>

08:09.197 --> 08:11.157
-<i>You got that?</i>
-No. No, I didn't.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.702
<i>It's like a rhyme. Say it with me.</i>

08:13.785 --> 08:16.329
<i>Stay away from its--</i>

08:16.413 --> 08:17.664
Oh, come on!

08:17.747 --> 08:21.209
<i>Other things to remember</i>
<i>include avoiding the poisonous--</i>

08:21.668 --> 08:22.877
<i>...eye sockets--</i>

08:22.961 --> 08:24.462
<i>...could lead to certain death!</i>

08:26.089 --> 08:29.009
Whoa. What are those?

08:30.593 --> 08:33.847
[Keith]
<i>They look like... dead planets.</i>

08:35.056 --> 08:36.390
That's strange.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.811
The charts I'm looking at show
these planets should still be thriving.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.063
Wow. What do you think happened
to them? Asteroid strike?

08:43.148 --> 08:45.984
Something tells me
they died an unnatural death.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.028
[Hunk]
<i>Look!</i>

08:51.114 --> 08:54.159
[Keith] <i>Guess that ancient Altean</i>
<i>weblum tracker put us right on the money.</i>

08:54.242 --> 08:56.661
We gotta get out of here!
We haven't watched the entire video yet!

08:56.745 --> 08:59.039
-We don't know what to do!
-We're not leaving.

08:59.122 --> 09:02.083
You fly, keep our distance.
I'll skim through the video.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.754
<i>So, you've made it</i>
<i>into the weblum's first stomach!</i>

09:05.837 --> 09:07.464
-[Hunk] <i>Rewind!</i>
-[Keith] <i>I know!</i>

09:08.131 --> 09:10.717
[Coran]
<i>So, you've identified a weblum. Great!</i>

09:10.800 --> 09:12.093
<i>Now, remember rule number one.</i>

09:12.677 --> 09:14.763
<i>Stay away from its face.</i>

09:14.846 --> 09:16.306
[Hunk]
<i>Wait, that's rule number one?</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:18.058
We broke rule number one!

09:20.435 --> 09:22.812
[Hunk]
<i>Oh, no! What's it doing?</i>

09:22.896 --> 09:25.023
Get us out of the way, now!

09:29.194 --> 09:31.112
[grunting]

09:49.923 --> 09:53.218
<i>The weblum's natural defense--</i>
<i>venomous laser, deadly acid--</i>

09:53.301 --> 09:55.428
<i>total annihilation--</i>
<i>death monster--</i>

09:55.845 --> 09:59.641
<i>...to find its blind spot on the back</i>
<i>of its neck, just below the gills.</i>

09:59.724 --> 10:04.896
<i>That's your way inside!</i>
<i>If I can't see ya, I can't kill ya!</i>

10:04.979 --> 10:06.523
-[rapid beeping]
-[grunts]

10:14.531 --> 10:16.616
This isn't good. This isn't good!

10:20.912 --> 10:22.163
[both grunting]

10:30.797 --> 10:33.383
We're attached to its back,
in its blind spot.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.135
Good. We're going in.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.929
Wait, what do we do
when we're inside the beast?

10:38.012 --> 10:40.723
<i>A quick recap of what to do</i>
<i>when you're inside the beast.</i>

10:40.807 --> 10:42.892
<i>One, avoid things that want to kill you.</i>

10:42.976 --> 10:46.396
<i>Two, get to the third stomach</i>
<i>and find the scaultrite gland.</i>

10:46.479 --> 10:49.107
<i>Three, activate the weblum's</i>
<i>defense mechanisms</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.526
<i>and collect the excess material</i>
<i>from the gland.</i>

10:51.609 --> 10:53.194
<i>That's the scaultrite!</i>

10:53.778 --> 10:56.781
-Seems simple enough.
-Seems under-explained.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.825
-Come on.
-[sighs]

11:02.620 --> 11:04.497
[grunts, groans]

11:14.048 --> 11:15.425
[grunting]

11:16.092 --> 11:17.343
[Hunk]
Got it, got it.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.694
Why are you tampering with evidence?

11:34.777 --> 11:38.489
Commander Thace, I was ordered
to assist you in your investigation

11:38.573 --> 11:40.533
into the possible traitors on board.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.452
Ordered by whom?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.120
Haggar.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.456
I've analyzed the sentry
that was destroyed

11:46.539 --> 11:48.708
just before the shields went down.

11:48.791 --> 11:53.379
The one that was killed by Prorok.
I've already examined him.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.300
<i>So, you found the trace elements</i>
<i>of luxite on the wound?</i>

12:00.178 --> 12:01.930
It's a very rare metal.

12:02.013 --> 12:04.766
If we find others on the ship
in possession of luxite,

12:04.849 --> 12:07.185
we will have found our traitors.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.103
Then what are you waiting for?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.147
Begin the search
starting with the lower block.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.733
I'll assign some sentries to that.

12:19.447 --> 12:21.824
Is there anything else?

12:21.908 --> 12:25.662
As chief investigator,
your life could be in danger.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.164
I have been given orders
to remain by your side

12:28.247 --> 12:31.834
until we clear all personnel
or find the spy.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.301
[grunts]
Uh, yuck!

12:40.385 --> 12:43.596
What am I standing on?
A mucus pocket? I do not like mucus!

12:43.680 --> 12:45.723
And is that steaming stomach acid?
Lookit, right over there.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.226
Oh, man, I really hope
I don't see any blood.

12:48.309 --> 12:52.313
Hunk! Knock it off.
You're freaking yourself out.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.775
No, standing inches away
from a pus-bubble is freaking me out.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.402
[groaning]

12:57.485 --> 13:01.531
Look, we're inside a disgusting worm.
There's no way to sugarcoat it.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.242
We're gonna need that big brain of yours
if we want to make it through.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.744
-Will you be all right?
-[continues groaning]

13:06.828 --> 13:09.580
I said, will you be all right?

13:09.664 --> 13:10.707
Uh...

13:10.790 --> 13:13.292
Okay, okay.
[inhales deeply]

13:13.376 --> 13:14.836
I'll be okay.

13:14.919 --> 13:18.631
Good. I gotta be able to count on you.

13:18.715 --> 13:22.802
Besides, no one knows
an explosive digestive tract like you.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.723
Wait, wait, wait.
Did you just make a joke?

13:27.390 --> 13:30.226
[chuckles]
Seriously, that was a joke, wasn't it?

13:30.309 --> 13:33.062
You're saying I throw up a lot.
I get it. It's funny.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.647
[laughing]

13:34.731 --> 13:35.732
I do.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.403
Wow. Galra Keith is way funnier
than regular Keith.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.656
Okay, we need to find a way
around the stomach acid.

13:43.948 --> 13:44.782
Huh?

13:46.159 --> 13:49.454
-What are these things?
-Uh... Uh...

13:51.330 --> 13:53.166
I don't know. Maybe they're bacteria?

13:53.249 --> 13:55.877
-Uh... Oh...
-[creatures squeaking]

13:55.960 --> 13:58.171
Wait, wait, wait. They seem friendly.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.256
They seem friendly.
Maybe they're good bacteria.

14:02.675 --> 14:07.346
They like me. They're--
[chuckles] They're tickling me.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.100
Wait, that's not tickling!
That's hot acid!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.478
[screams] They want to kill us!
They want to kill us!

14:14.812 --> 14:16.898
I think they're part
of the creature's digestive system!

14:16.981 --> 14:19.567
They're trying to break down the food
and we're the food!

14:25.156 --> 14:27.950
[groaning]
I can't see anything!

14:28.034 --> 14:29.702
[groans, grunts]

14:29.786 --> 14:31.120
[grunting]

14:31.746 --> 14:32.955
Hunk!

14:33.873 --> 14:37.043
I'm here, surrounded by blood.
I hate blood!

14:37.126 --> 14:39.670
[Keith] <i>You've gotta find a way out</i>
<i>of the circulatory system.</i>

14:48.304 --> 14:52.517
Hunk! I'm outnumbered here!
Meet me in the third stomach!

14:59.982 --> 15:01.984
Gotta get out of this acid.

15:05.863 --> 15:07.907
[screaming]

15:07.990 --> 15:09.534
[grunting]

15:09.617 --> 15:10.660
Huh?

15:12.578 --> 15:13.746
[grunting]

15:16.332 --> 15:18.167
[breathing heavily]

15:20.711 --> 15:21.546
What the--?

15:22.713 --> 15:23.840
Impossible.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.428
[screams]
I don't like blood-slides!

15:28.511 --> 15:29.345
[grunts]

15:29.429 --> 15:31.389
[grunting]

15:32.098 --> 15:33.474
Oh, no.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.022
Don't move. I'm here to help.

15:50.950 --> 15:51.951
Huh?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.536
[grunting]

15:53.619 --> 15:56.205
[weapon whirring]

15:57.415 --> 16:00.126
-You're Galra.
-[creatures squeaking]

16:04.422 --> 16:05.715
Not those things again.

16:06.841 --> 16:07.967
What are you doing?

16:08.050 --> 16:09.510
[alarm blaring]

16:10.344 --> 16:12.221
You're turning this ship into a bomb.

16:19.729 --> 16:20.646
[grunts]

16:21.063 --> 16:22.023
[grunting]

16:24.984 --> 16:26.944
[grunting]

16:27.028 --> 16:28.029
[loud rumbling]

16:28.112 --> 16:30.239
Keith! Keith, are you there?

16:31.449 --> 16:32.992
Keith, answer me!

16:33.075 --> 16:34.619
[grunting]

16:34.702 --> 16:36.454
[grunting, yelling]

16:36.537 --> 16:38.039
-[groaning]
-[running footsteps approaching]

16:39.707 --> 16:41.125
[gasps, grunts]

16:42.460 --> 16:43.336
[weapon whirring]

16:50.009 --> 16:51.844
I guess you can keep your weapon.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.853
[groaning, grunting]

17:02.313 --> 17:03.231
[sighs]

17:03.814 --> 17:04.982
[groans]

17:05.691 --> 17:07.859
-Oh, my gosh, I found it!
-[stomach grumbling]

17:07.944 --> 17:11.280
Oh, my gosh, don't throw up.
Don't throw-- [retches]

17:14.116 --> 17:19.079
Keith! Keith, you made it!
We both made it! Who is this?

17:19.163 --> 17:24.335
Someone I found.
He doesn't talk much. Also, he's Galra.

17:24.417 --> 17:26.837
What, do you guys all know
each other? [chuckles]

17:27.421 --> 17:30.091
Are you sure we should be rescuing
a Galra soldier right now?

17:30.174 --> 17:32.426
We're Paladins of Voltron.

17:32.510 --> 17:35.388
We can't just leave people to die
even if they are Galra.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.432
Now, come on. Let's get
what we came for and get out.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.102
Okay, well, that--
that might be a problem, too.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.605
The scaultrite gland somehow secretes
mucus, or saliva, or something gross,

17:44.689 --> 17:46.065
which becomes crystallized.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.485
The only problem is, I think that we have
to trigger the weblum's defense mechanism.

17:49.569 --> 17:50.528
[rumbling]

17:52.572 --> 17:55.032
[groans]
Not again.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.701
-[rumbling]
-[both] Uh...

18:05.960 --> 18:06.919
[grunts]

18:12.383 --> 18:14.885
[gasps, screams]

18:18.264 --> 18:19.515
They're everywhere!

18:21.142 --> 18:22.560
Oh, whoa.

18:33.154 --> 18:37.491
[both yelling, grunting]

18:40.578 --> 18:43.122
I think this thing is getting rid
of the excess gas produced

18:43.205 --> 18:44.832
from its multiple stomachs.

18:44.915 --> 18:48.127
-What?
-It's farting! [laughs]

18:49.503 --> 18:50.379
[grunts]

18:50.463 --> 18:54.008
Hunk, what do we gotta do
to get that scaultrite gland to goop?

18:54.091 --> 18:57.386
Uh, oh. Uh... Wait a second,
wait a second, wait a second.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.389
"Stay away from its face."
The blue laser.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.892
Ah! I know what to do!

19:03.934 --> 19:04.935
What?

19:05.603 --> 19:07.980
If we want that third stomach gland
to secrete the ooze,

19:08.064 --> 19:11.067
I need to get farted out
of the weblum's butt and attack the face,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.694
getting it to fire its laser puke.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.447
For the sake of the universe,
I'll provoke the beast!

19:16.530 --> 19:18.699
You two stay here and get that scaultrite!

19:21.410 --> 19:24.580
Hurry! I don't know how long
we can hold these things off.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.848
[yelling]

19:43.015 --> 19:44.016
I'm out!

19:44.725 --> 19:45.893
Heading to my lion now.

20:01.742 --> 20:02.827
-[door beeping]
-[gasps]

20:03.577 --> 20:04.829
Commander, there you are.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.581
The lower block has
been scanned for luxite.

20:07.665 --> 20:11.502
-I found nothing.
-Then continue the search.

20:11.585 --> 20:15.464
Sir, I must remain by your side.
Haggar's orders.

20:23.806 --> 20:27.226
Hunk, whatever you're
gonna do, do it now!

20:27.309 --> 20:30.730
Roger that.
Provoking giant space worm now.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.153
Come on!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.075
Hunk!

20:43.159 --> 20:45.077
Let's see you ignore me now.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.002
<i>Yoo-hoo! Over here!</i>

20:59.842 --> 21:01.927
Yes! Yes, it's gonna do it!

21:02.678 --> 21:04.346
Oh, no, it's gonna do it!

21:10.227 --> 21:11.979
[gasps]
It's working!

21:13.522 --> 21:15.566
I think it's about to get hot in here.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.915
[Hunk]
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

21:30.998 --> 21:31.999
<i>Oh, no!</i>

21:33.042 --> 21:34.960
[yelling]

21:35.044 --> 21:36.170
[grunts]

21:37.630 --> 21:40.299
<i>Oh, yeah! He's out!</i>

21:40.382 --> 21:42.802
[sighs]
Tell me you got the scaultrite.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.806
Grabbing it now.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.818
[weapon whirring]

22:01.111 --> 22:03.072
So, you're just like the rest of 'em.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.163
I'm coming out.

22:12.540 --> 22:13.541
[Hunk]
<i>On my way.</i>

22:21.090 --> 22:22.591
Where's your buddy?

22:22.675 --> 22:26.345
He's long gone by now,
and he got a bag of scaultrite.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.347
What? Should we go after him?

22:28.430 --> 22:32.601
No. Whatever the Galra are planning
won't matter after we defeat Zarkon.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.686
Copy that.

22:34.645 --> 22:38.232
By the way, Hunk, you really came through
in the clutch back there.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.484
Without you, the mission
would have been a failure.

22:40.568 --> 22:43.445
Aw, thanks, Galra Keith.
You're all right.

22:43.529 --> 22:46.031
I think turning Galra has
made you a better human.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.701
<i>I didn't just turn Galra!</i>
