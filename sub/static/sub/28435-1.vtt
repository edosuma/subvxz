00:02.667 --> 00:04.371
# We're not going out

00:04.373 --> 00:06.191
# Not staying in

00:06.193 --> 00:08.727
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

00:08.728 --> 00:12.127
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:12.128 --> 00:15.192
# We're not going out

00:15.193 --> 00:18.193
# We are not going out. #

00:21.031 --> 00:23.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, we're at 4,000 feet.</font>

00:23.031 --> 00:27.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, just like we did in training,
I'll attach the clip like this,</font>

00:27.032 --> 00:30.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> you'll jump, and your chute
opens automatically.</font>

00:30.031 --> 00:32.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Any questions?</font>

00:32.031 --> 00:34.432
<font color="#00FFFF"> What time's the drinks trolley
coming round?</font>

00:36.031 --> 00:38.832
<font color="#11FF11"> What if the cord gets pulled
too hard and it comes off?</font>

00:38.833 --> 00:40.030
<font color="#FFFF00">It won't.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"> It might.</font>

00:40.031 --> 00:42.299
<font color="#11FF11"> I did that with the bathroom light
once.</font>

00:44.031 --> 00:47.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK, I'll let you know
when we're ready to rock.</font>

00:47.031 --> 00:50.030
<font color="#11FF11"> I am so excited!</font>
Have you ever done this before, Lee?</font>

00:50.031 --> 00:52.030
Er, I did one of those
tandem sky dives.

00:52.031 --> 00:53.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Was it all OK?</font>

00:53.032 --> 00:55.031
Yeah, but the bicycle
was a write-off!

00:56.165 --> 01:00.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> He's never done a skydive before,
Mum. None of us have.</font>

01:00.031 --> 01:04.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Not true. I made a number of jumps
during my army days.</font>

01:04.031 --> 01:05.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> In the Catering Corps?!</font>

01:07.031 --> 01:10.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> I think you're mixing
the words up - "jumps" and "soups".</font>

01:10.031 --> 01:14.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Quite an experience, I can tell you!
Everyone staring at each other</font>

01:14.031 --> 01:17.030
<font color="#11FF11"> in nervous silence,
without so much as a cup of tea</font>

01:17.031 --> 01:20.030
<font color="#11FF11"> to take your mind off things.
Then, without warning,</font>

01:20.031 --> 01:22.030
<font color="#11FF11"> you're shoved out the door.</font>

01:22.031 --> 01:24.699
<font color="#00FFFF"> Sounds like the last time
we visited your house, Geoffrey!</font>

01:26.031 --> 01:29.030
Your first time as well,
then, Frank? <font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#FFFF00"> Sure is.</font>

01:29.031 --> 01:31.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, come on, Frank.
You're forgetting that time</font>

01:31.032 --> 01:34.031
<font color="#11FF11"> you were ejected from
the easyJet flight to Glasgow!</font>

01:36.031 --> 01:38.030
<font color="#FFFF00">You all right, Mum?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not really!</font>

01:38.031 --> 01:41.030
<font color="#11FF11"> It seemed like a fun idea when
Toby first suggested it, but...</font>

01:41.031 --> 01:44.030
<font color="#11FF11"> ..now we're so high up,
I'm having second thoughts.</font>

01:44.031 --> 01:46.965
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, if you're feeling nervous,
just think of all the money</font>

01:46.966 --> 01:50.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> we're raising for the hospital.
Everybody's done a great job. </font>Yeah.</font>

01:50.031 --> 01:51.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> Even Anna's been very supportive.</font>

01:51.032 --> 01:53.832
<font color="#00FFFF">What do you mean, "even Anna"?!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, sorry, darling,</font>

01:53.833 --> 01:57.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> I didn't mean to... </font>Trust me,
I'd never pass up the opportunity</font>

01:57.031 --> 01:58.299
<font color="#11FF11"> of seeing you fall out of
an aeroplane!</font>

02:00.031 --> 02:02.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> You seem very relaxed
about this, Lee.</font>

02:02.031 --> 02:03.164
I can't wait.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.030
It's one of these things
you've got to do before you die.

02:06.031 --> 02:08.031
Just hopefully not
immediately before you die!

02:10.031 --> 02:11.832
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK, I need everyone to listen up.</font>

02:11.833 --> 02:14.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> I'm afraid we've got a problem.</font>
What problem? What's gone wrong?</font>

02:14.031 --> 02:16.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's absolutely nothing
to worry about,</font>

02:16.031 --> 02:18.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> but I've somehow managed to make
a real cock-up.</font>

02:18.031 --> 02:20.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Please accept my sincere apologies,</font>

02:20.031 --> 02:23.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> but I've only noted six parachutes
for seven people.</font>

02:23.031 --> 02:25.966
<font color="#00FFFF"> You mean one of us has got to jump
without a parachute?</font>

02:28.031 --> 02:29.431
<font color="#FFFF00"> Obviously, it doesn't mean that.</font>

02:29.432 --> 02:31.833
<font color="#11FF11"> Don't put him off if he's keen!</font>

02:34.031 --> 02:36.164
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm sorry to say that
one of you can't do the jump.</font>

02:36.165 --> 02:39.030
Well, whose parachute
are you missing? <font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Er...</font>

02:39.031 --> 02:42.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Let's see. Remind me,
which one of you is Wendy?</font>

02:42.031 --> 02:44.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Me!</font>

02:44.031 --> 02:45.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> Right, we've definitely got yours.</font>

02:46.833 --> 02:48.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> And, let's see, we've got, er...</font>

02:48.031 --> 02:51.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Toby's. We've got Lucy's.</font>

02:51.031 --> 02:52.565
<font color="#FFFF00"> We've got Frank's. Er...</font>

02:52.566 --> 02:55.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> We've got Geoffrey's.</font>
Oh, get on with it, Simon Cowell,

02:55.032 --> 02:57.030
and just announce the loser!

02:57.031 --> 02:59.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> Lee, yours is missing.</font>

03:00.031 --> 03:03.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> How?</font>
Mistakes happen, I'm afraid.</font>

03:03.031 --> 03:06.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Not the words you want to hear
from a parachute company!</font>

03:06.031 --> 03:08.030
Didn't they teach you
how to count in Australia?

03:08.031 --> 03:10.566
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, because I'm from New Zealand.</font>

03:11.699 --> 03:13.030
Same thing.

03:13.031 --> 03:15.431
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, they're next to each other,
but they're not the same thing.</font>

03:15.432 --> 03:18.031
What, you mean a bit like
the numbers six and seven?!

03:19.031 --> 03:22.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, of course, we'll arrange for
you to come back at a later date,</font>

03:22.031 --> 03:25.698
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> free of charge, Lee.</font>
But the charity event is today.</font>

03:25.699 --> 03:28.164
Yeah, the local press photographers
are down there waiting for us,

03:28.165 --> 03:31.030
and I promised the kids
I'd be in the paper.

03:31.031 --> 03:33.032
<font color="#11FF11"> You'll just have to go to back to
Plan A, and rob a Post Office!</font>

03:34.566 --> 03:36.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Sorry.</font>

03:36.031 --> 03:39.698
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, Lee, it must be
really disappointing for you.</font>

03:39.699 --> 03:43.565
There is another option. <span tts: color="white <font color="#00FFFF"> What? </font>Well,
it's clear I'm not exactly keen -</font>

03:43.566 --> 03:45.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> why not take my parachute?</font>

03:45.031 --> 03:47.565
<font color="#00FFFF">Absolutely not.</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> Why?!</font>

03:47.566 --> 03:49.698
<font color="#11FF11"> Because I don't want
your day spoiled.</font>

03:49.699 --> 03:51.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Spoiled?!</font>

03:51.031 --> 03:53.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm terrified!</font>

03:53.031 --> 03:54.164
<font color="#11FF11"> And that's the reason
you should jump.</font>

03:54.165 --> 03:56.031
<font color="#11FF11"> My commanding officer
always used to say,</font>

03:56.032 --> 04:00.030
<font color="#11FF11"> "When you have a fear,
you need to deal with it...</font>

04:00.031 --> 04:01.832
<font color="#11FF11"> "..head-on."</font>

04:01.833 --> 04:04.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Same reason I showed up
to Lee and Lucy's wedding.</font>

04:06.031 --> 04:08.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> But I don't want to jump!</font>

04:08.031 --> 04:11.832
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, I do feel somewhat
responsible, as the organiser, so...</font>

04:11.833 --> 04:13.832
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..probably, it should be me
that misses out.</font>

04:13.833 --> 04:16.832
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, don't be so bloody obliging,
Toby, my God!</font>

04:16.833 --> 04:20.031
<font color="#11FF11"> You'd give up your place in our bed,
if someone asked you politely!</font>

04:22.299 --> 04:24.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Toby, please...</font>

04:24.031 --> 04:26.832
<font color="#11FF11"> That wasn't a genuine offer.</font>

04:26.833 --> 04:31.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Look, I don't care about jumping,
either way. I'll happily miss out.</font>

04:31.031 --> 04:32.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, no, no, no.</font>

04:32.032 --> 04:35.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm too much of a gentleman
to see a lady disappointed.</font>

04:35.031 --> 04:36.431
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lee, take my parachute.</font>

04:36.432 --> 04:39.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's OK, Frank,
I'm not disappointed.</font>

04:39.031 --> 04:41.565
<font color="#FFFF00"> I just want Lee to get his turn.</font>

04:41.566 --> 04:43.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> He can have mine.</font>

04:43.032 --> 04:45.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> Honestly, I insist.</font>

04:45.032 --> 04:49.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, here's a rich display
of humbuggery!</font>

04:49.031 --> 04:51.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> You what?</font>

04:51.031 --> 04:53.030
<font color="#11FF11"> It's obvious. You're all terrified.</font>

04:53.031 --> 04:55.030
<font color="#11FF11"> In fact, Wendy's the bravest one
among you.</font>

04:55.031 --> 04:58.030
<font color="#11FF11"> At least she has the courage
to admit to her fears.</font>

04:58.031 --> 05:02.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Now, would anyone else
like to offer to stay behind?</font>

05:03.566 --> 05:06.030
<font color="#11FF11"> No, I thought not.
So, that's settled.</font>

05:06.031 --> 05:07.699
<font color="#11FF11"> Lee, you can take my parachute.</font>

05:08.833 --> 05:10.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> You're as scared as the rest of us.</font>

05:10.031 --> 05:13.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Not so. I overcame any misgivings
I might have had one night</font>

05:13.031 --> 05:16.030
<font color="#11FF11"> in a military transport aircraft
over Belize.</font>

05:16.031 --> 05:18.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> Nobody wants to know
how you popped your cherry!</font>

05:18.032 --> 05:21.030
<font color="#11FF11"> I was part of
a special operations team.</font>

05:21.031 --> 05:23.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Officially, we didn't exist.</font>

05:23.031 --> 05:27.299
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, here we go, a load of nonsense
about pervert operations!</font>

05:29.566 --> 05:31.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Covert!</font>

05:31.031 --> 05:34.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> He could tell us,
but then he'd have to kill us!</font>

05:34.031 --> 05:36.031
<font color="#11FF11"> I might just tell Frank!</font>

05:38.031 --> 05:41.030
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm merely saying that I'm the
only one here with nothing to prove.</font>

05:41.031 --> 05:43.832
<font color="#11FF11"> Believe me, Frank,
if ever we find ourselves</font>

05:43.833 --> 05:46.030
<font color="#11FF11"> doing a sponsored benefit fraud,</font>

05:46.031 --> 05:49.030
<font color="#11FF11"> I'll be sure to defer
to your experience.</font>

05:49.031 --> 05:52.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Looks like Lee and I are the
only ones looking forward to this.</font>

05:52.031 --> 05:54.965
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I'm happy to admit
I'm nervous,</font>

05:54.966 --> 05:57.565
<font color="#00FFFF"> so I would like to give
Lee my parachute.</font>

05:57.566 --> 05:59.030
<font color="#11FF11"> No, I would.</font>

05:59.031 --> 06:01.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, I offered first.</font>

06:01.031 --> 06:04.030
<font color="#11FF11">I think you'll find I did.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, I did!</font>

06:04.031 --> 06:07.030
Don't start bickering with each
other! There's only one person

06:07.031 --> 06:09.030
to blame for this.
We wouldn't be in this situation

06:09.031 --> 06:11.030
if Dame Edna was doing
his job properly!

06:11.031 --> 06:15.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm a Kiwi! </font>I don't care if
you're a watermelon, mate!

06:17.031 --> 06:19.030
You have ruined our day out!

06:19.031 --> 06:21.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Look, I've said I'm sorry, guys.</font>

06:21.031 --> 06:23.030
How hard can it be?

06:23.031 --> 06:25.298
You count the parachutes,
you take them off that blue rack,

06:25.299 --> 06:28.030
you load them onto the plane.
Job done.

06:28.031 --> 06:30.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> How did you know
they were on a blue rack?</font>

06:33.031 --> 06:37.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> What? </font>You just said the packs
were stored on a blue rack.</font>

06:37.031 --> 06:39.698
<font color="#FFFF00"> That's back at base,
behind a door marked "Private".</font>

06:39.699 --> 06:42.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> You shouldn't have been in there.</font>

06:42.031 --> 06:44.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, what were you doing in
a private area?</font>

06:44.031 --> 06:45.565
I'm not telling you.

06:45.566 --> 06:47.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why not?</font>

06:47.031 --> 06:49.031
It's private.

06:50.031 --> 06:52.431
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's quite clear
what he was doing in there.</font>

06:52.432 --> 06:54.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> He was hiding his parachute.</font>

06:54.031 --> 06:58.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Suddenly, that display of bravado
makes perfect sense.</font>

06:58.031 --> 07:00.030
<font color="#11FF11"> He was looking forward to the jump</font>

07:00.031 --> 07:03.030
<font color="#11FF11"> because he knew
he wouldn't have to do it.</font>

07:03.031 --> 07:04.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> Is that right, Lee?</font>

07:04.031 --> 07:05.031
Oh...

07:05.032 --> 07:07.030
Of course it bloody is!

07:07.031 --> 07:10.030
Have you seen how high up
these planes go?!

07:10.031 --> 07:12.030
I'd rather jump out of
a birthday cake at Wormwood Scrubs

07:12.031 --> 07:14.031
dressed as Marilyn Monroe!

07:15.566 --> 07:17.832
Anyway, what's done is done.

07:17.833 --> 07:20.030
I haven't got a parachute,
so I can't jump.

07:20.031 --> 07:21.298
<font color="#FFFF00"> At school, if you forgot your kit,</font>

07:21.299 --> 07:23.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> they made you do it
in your underpants!</font>

07:24.031 --> 07:28.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't think any of us want to see
Lee's underpants at the moment!</font>

07:29.833 --> 07:33.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> It's a pretty shabby trick
to pull, Lee. </font>Well...

07:33.031 --> 07:34.298
..I had my reasons.

07:34.299 --> 07:36.270
<font color="#FFFF00"> What reasons?</font>
I'll show you.

07:36.272 --> 07:40.597
For subtitling services, contatct:
waqas.zahoor89@gmail.com

07:40.599 --> 07:42.664
<font color="#FFFF00"> To get Caffe Nero loyalty stamps?!</font>

07:45.032 --> 07:47.832
Think of the kids.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.431
It's all well and good
ONE of their parents

07:49.432 --> 07:51.030
jumping out of
an aeroplane.

07:51.031 --> 07:54.030
For both me and Lucy
to risk our lives,

07:54.031 --> 07:56.031
I couldn't be
that selfish.

07:57.031 --> 07:59.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> That's actually a very good point.</font>

07:59.031 --> 08:01.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> We can't risk us both jumping.</font>

08:01.031 --> 08:03.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> That would be totally irresponsible.</font>

08:04.031 --> 08:05.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm staying on the plane.</font>

08:06.966 --> 08:10.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Hang on... </font>Well, I'm the engine room
of the parenting machine.</font>

08:10.031 --> 08:13.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> They need me more.</font>
And what am I?

08:13.031 --> 08:15.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> The light entertainment.</font>

08:16.566 --> 08:19.698
<font color="#11FF11"> This is ridiculous! People hardly
ever die from skydiving.</font>

08:19.699 --> 08:22.832
That's because people
hardly ever go skydiving!

08:22.833 --> 08:26.298
<font color="#11FF11"> The only fatalities that ever occur
are usually premeditated murders,</font>

08:26.299 --> 08:28.565
<font color="#11FF11"> when one person
deliberately interferes</font>

08:28.566 --> 08:30.031
<font color="#11FF11"> with someone else's parachute.</font>

08:34.030 --> 08:37.030
Anyway, it's not up for grabs.
I'm staying on the plane because

08:37.030 --> 08:40.565
<font color="#11FF11"> it's my parachute that's missing.</font>
No, it's A parachute that's missing.</font>

08:40.566 --> 08:42.030
It's not one-size-fits-all,
you know.

08:42.030 --> 08:46.030
These parachutes are individually
calibrated to each person's weight.

08:46.031 --> 08:47.965
<font color="#FFFF00"> Actually...</font>

08:47.966 --> 08:50.431
Let's assume I'm right, and not now
listen to what this man says!

08:50.432 --> 08:54.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> He is, after all, from the land of
ball tampering. </font>That's Australia.</font>

08:54.031 --> 08:57.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> And the parachutes are not
weight-specific at all.</font>

08:57.031 --> 08:58.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> You can totally swap them round.</font>

08:58.032 --> 09:00.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> I mean, they're basically
all the same.</font>

09:00.031 --> 09:03.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> You know, like Kiwis and Aussies!</font>

09:03.031 --> 09:07.030
<font color="#11FF11"> So, there we have it. Whatever else
happens, Lee is going to jump.</font>

09:07.031 --> 09:09.031
<font color="#11FF11"> In fact, I propose he goes first.</font>

09:11.833 --> 09:15.030
No chance! None of us have to
actually jump if we don't want to.

09:15.031 --> 09:18.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yes, you do. This is for
a children's hospital ward.</font>

09:18.031 --> 09:20.698
<font color="#FFFF00"> The press are waiting
for us on the ground.</font>

09:20.699 --> 09:22.164
<font color="#FFFF00"> Think of the shame.</font>

09:22.165 --> 09:24.030
What if I get injured?

09:24.031 --> 09:26.030
<font color="#11FF11"> Very, very unlikely.
Isn't that right?</font>

09:26.031 --> 09:29.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#11FF11"> Well, the injury rate is
one in every 2,000 jumps... </font>You see?</font>

09:29.031 --> 09:33.699
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..and I've personally overseen
more than 1,950 without incident.</font>

09:36.031 --> 09:38.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anyway, put your pack on, Lee.</font>

09:38.031 --> 09:40.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Get ready to rock!</font>

09:40.031 --> 09:42.031
Hang on, it's not fair!
Why do I have to go first?!

09:42.032 --> 09:45.030
<font color="#11FF11"> It's quite simple, Lee -
you cheated, and you were found out.</font>

09:45.031 --> 09:48.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Now you have to
face the consequences.</font>

09:49.833 --> 09:52.031
<font color="#FFFF00"> Just imagine you're
stepping out of your front door.</font>

09:53.031 --> 09:56.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> And falling into a 10,000-foot hole!</font>

09:56.031 --> 09:57.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Look lively, Lee!</font>

09:57.032 --> 10:00.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, just get on with it!</font>

10:00.031 --> 10:02.298
Oh, yeah, you're all siding with
Geoffrey now he's bullying me,

10:02.299 --> 10:06.030
but what if I do jump? Then what?
You all want the safe seat,

10:06.031 --> 10:09.030
but he's going to start turning
on all of you lot next!

10:09.031 --> 10:11.030
He'll probably start with
you first, Dad.

10:11.031 --> 10:12.832
<font color="#00FFFF"> Is that right?</font>

10:12.833 --> 10:14.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, I should think so!</font>

10:15.032 --> 10:18.030
See? And then the rest of you,
one by one,

10:18.031 --> 10:21.030
until he's the last one left on the
plane, and he doesn't have to jump!

10:21.031 --> 10:25.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Nonsense, I'm the only one happy
to jump! </font>Don't listen to him!

10:25.031 --> 10:28.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> I suppose it does make sense
to actually discuss</font>

10:28.031 --> 10:30.164
<font color="#00FFFF"> which one of us stays behind.</font>

10:30.165 --> 10:31.833
Good.

10:34.031 --> 10:36.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Perhaps we should each
take it in turns</font>

10:36.031 --> 10:38.298
<font color="#FFFF00"> to explain why we should be the one
who doesn't jump.</font>

10:38.299 --> 10:41.030
Good idea. Me first.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> Guys, we've only got so much time.</font>

10:43.031 --> 10:47.030
Don't worry,
I'll be very, very brief.

10:47.031 --> 10:50.030
<font color="#FFFF00"> When I was seven years old...</font>
Bloody hell!</font>

10:50.031 --> 10:52.030
..there was a fruit tree
in our garden.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.966
<font color="#11FF11"> I don't remember that.</font>
The fruit tree, or my childhood?!

10:56.699 --> 10:59.298
Nothing ever grew on this tree.
And then, one day,

10:59.299 --> 11:03.030
I noticed a solitary piece of fruit
very high up.

11:03.031 --> 11:06.030
So, I climbed that tree to get it.

11:06.031 --> 11:09.030
When I got to the top, I got stuck.

11:09.031 --> 11:13.030
Obviously, I called for help,
but nobody came.

11:13.031 --> 11:16.031
In the end, I had no choice
but to jump.

11:17.031 --> 11:19.030
I wasn't injured...

11:19.031 --> 11:21.031
<font color="#11FF11"> Shame, I was starting to
enjoy this story!</font>

11:22.966 --> 11:26.030
..but I've been terrified of heights
ever since.

11:26.031 --> 11:29.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, that doesn't excuse
your behaviour today,</font>

11:29.031 --> 11:31.832
<font color="#00FFFF"> but it does explain it.</font>

11:31.833 --> 11:33.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> Anyone else?</font>

11:33.031 --> 11:34.565
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, since you ask,</font>

11:34.566 --> 11:38.165
<font color="#11FF11"> when I was a child, a friend of
my mother's died in a plane crash.</font>

11:39.833 --> 11:43.965
<font color="#11FF11"> I didn't think it had affected me
and yet, being here today,</font>

11:43.966 --> 11:46.031
<font color="#11FF11"> somehow, the memories
have come flooding back.</font>

11:47.566 --> 11:51.965
<font color="#11FF11"> But your tree story
was very moving as well, Lee.</font>

11:51.966 --> 11:53.432
<font color="#11FF11"> I want to change it.</font>
You can't.</font>

11:55.031 --> 11:57.030
<font color="#00FFFF"> My turn.</font>

11:57.031 --> 11:59.031
<font color="#00FFFF"> It was a stormy winter's evening...</font>

12:00.738 --> 12:02.272
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..and I was helping to airlift</font>

12:02.273 --> 12:05.737
<font color="#11FF11"> <font color="#11FF11"> some orphans from a burning
building... </font>This is ridiculous!</font>

12:05.738 --> 12:08.405
<font color="#11FF11"> Am I the only person on this plane
who intends to jump?!</font>

12:08.406 --> 12:09.737
Ooh, be my guest!

12:09.738 --> 12:12.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, no, after you!</font>
Oh, no, no, Geoffrey, after you!

12:12.738 --> 12:14.405
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, no, Lee, I insist!</font>

12:14.406 --> 12:16.672
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, for God's sake, stop it!</font>

12:16.673 --> 12:19.539
<font color="#00FFFF"> If the only way to stay behind
is to squabble like a child,</font>

12:19.540 --> 12:20.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> then I'd rather jump!</font>

12:20.738 --> 12:24.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're supposed to be raising money
for very sick kiddies.</font>

12:24.738 --> 12:27.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> You should all be ashamed
of yourselves!</font>

12:31.738 --> 12:32.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> Is she all right?!</font>

12:32.739 --> 12:35.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> The chute's open,
she's drifting down like a feather.</font>

12:35.738 --> 12:36.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> Textbook!</font>

12:38.738 --> 12:40.738
<font color="#11FF11"> I've never been more proud of her.</font>

12:40.739 --> 12:45.672
Oh, come on, guys. Wendy's right.

12:45.673 --> 12:47.871
We shouldn't be squabbling
like this.

12:47.872 --> 12:52.138
Especially when it's for sickly
children who need our help.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.738
Go for it, Lucy!

12:55.738 --> 12:58.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Me?! </font>Well, do you want
to make me feel proud?

12:58.738 --> 13:01.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> I don't know. Do you want to
make me feel resentful?</font>

13:02.738 --> 13:06.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Look, it's obvious who should be
risking their life next -</font>

13:06.738 --> 13:07.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Toby.</font>

13:09.738 --> 13:11.272
<font color="#FFFF00"> Why? Just because the event
was my idea,</font>

13:11.273 --> 13:13.005
<font color="#FFFF00"> and I organised
all the press coverage?</font>

13:13.006 --> 13:15.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, I was thinking more in terms
of general expendability,</font>

13:15.738 --> 13:17.737
<font color="#11FF11"> but those are good reasons, too.</font>

13:17.738 --> 13:19.672
<font color="#FFFF00"> Anna's right.</font>

13:19.673 --> 13:22.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> We wouldn't be here in the first
place if it wasn't for Toby.</font>

13:22.738 --> 13:24.138
<font color="#FFFF00"> He should definitely jump next.</font>

13:24.139 --> 13:26.006
<font color="#11FF11"> Exactly.</font>
I agree.

13:28.738 --> 13:29.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> I see.</font>

13:29.739 --> 13:33.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> Clearly, the mob
has chosen its victim.</font>

13:35.139 --> 13:37.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Oh, and for the record,
I think the person</font>

13:37.738 --> 13:39.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> who gets to stay behind should be
Anna.</font>

13:39.738 --> 13:43.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, let me guess, because I can fly
out of the plane on my broomstick?</font>

13:44.738 --> 13:47.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> No, I just think you should get
the safe seat.</font>

13:47.738 --> 13:50.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> I pressurised you into doing this,
and I'm sorry.</font>

13:50.739 --> 13:53.673
<font color="#FFFF00"> I just want you to enjoy your day...</font>

13:55.738 --> 13:57.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> ..because I love you.</font>

14:02.738 --> 14:04.273
<font color="#FFFF00"> That was so beautiful!</font>

14:06.738 --> 14:08.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> It certainly was.</font>

14:08.738 --> 14:11.739
<font color="#00FFFF"> I don't know when I've heard
such noble, romantic words...</font>

14:13.738 --> 14:14.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..or when I will again.</font>

14:15.872 --> 14:18.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> So, who's next?</font>

14:21.738 --> 14:24.272
This is becoming very
Lord Of The Flies.

14:24.273 --> 14:26.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> I suppose that makes you Gandalf!</font>

14:28.739 --> 14:31.737
So, come on, who IS next?

14:31.738 --> 14:33.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Me.</font>

14:33.738 --> 14:36.138
<font color="#00FFFF"> But Toby just said
he wanted you to stay safe.</font>

14:36.139 --> 14:39.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I know,
and he also said he loved me,</font>

14:39.738 --> 14:41.737
<font color="#11FF11"> the manipulative bastard!</font>

14:41.738 --> 14:44.005
<font color="#11FF11"> If he does this and I don't,</font>

14:44.006 --> 14:47.737
<font color="#11FF11"> he's got the high ground over me
for the next ten years.</font>

14:47.738 --> 14:49.737
<font color="#11FF11"> With any luck, I'll break my ankle,</font>

14:49.738 --> 14:51.738
<font color="#11FF11"> then he'll know
what guilt feels like!</font>

14:56.738 --> 14:58.738
<font color="#11FF11"> And then there were four.</font>

14:59.738 --> 15:01.273
Well, three and a bit!

15:03.738 --> 15:05.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK, guys, we're on a roll!
Who's next?</font>

15:07.738 --> 15:10.539
<font color="#00FFFF"> Look, this is ridiculous,
whittling down the group one by one.</font>

15:10.540 --> 15:12.539
<font color="#00FFFF"> We should just make a decision.</font>

15:12.540 --> 15:13.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> The person who gets to stay.</font>

15:13.738 --> 15:16.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> How do we do that?
We all want to stay.</font>

15:16.738 --> 15:19.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Not so. I'm happy to jump
once I've seen Lee do the same.</font>

15:19.738 --> 15:22.138
<font color="#11FF11"> Therefore, I nominate that Lucy
gets to stay behind.</font>

15:22.139 --> 15:24.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Assuming you three
nominate yourselves,</font>

15:24.738 --> 15:27.738
<font color="#11FF11"> that gives Lucy the largest vote,
so she's safe.</font>

15:28.738 --> 15:31.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Are you panicking there, Frank,
or just struggling with the maths?</font>

15:32.738 --> 15:37.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Lucy's not necessarily safe,
because if Lee votes to save me,</font>

15:37.738 --> 15:39.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> that means I've got
two votes as well.</font>

15:39.738 --> 15:40.738
I'm not voting for you.

15:40.739 --> 15:44.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> I tell you what, I'll vote for you
if you vote for me.</font>

15:44.738 --> 15:47.737
Do you need a pen and paper
to work out why that won't work?!

15:47.738 --> 15:50.737
<font color="#11FF11"> So, Lucy has a landslide victory.</font>

15:50.738 --> 15:53.871
<font color="#00FFFF"> No, she hasn't. I demand my rights!</font>

15:53.872 --> 15:55.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I think the rights of
cowardly gnomes</font>

15:55.738 --> 15:58.006
<font color="#11FF11"> have yet to be ratified
by the Geneva Convention.</font>

16:00.738 --> 16:03.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Watch your mouth, sunshine,</font>

16:03.738 --> 16:05.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> or we'll take this outside!</font>

16:07.738 --> 16:09.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know what I mean.</font>

16:11.006 --> 16:13.737
I vote for Lucy as well.

16:13.738 --> 16:14.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> What are you doing?</font>

16:14.739 --> 16:17.737
I might be scared,
but I'm not a total coward.

16:17.738 --> 16:21.539
If Toby can jump to save Anna,
then I can do the same to save Lucy.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Thanks, Lee.</font>
It's three against one, Dad.

16:23.738 --> 16:25.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Let's try something else.</font>

16:25.738 --> 16:26.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> One potato, two potato...</font>

16:26.739 --> 16:28.737
Stop it!

16:28.738 --> 16:30.737
It's only you trying to
save their skin now.

16:30.738 --> 16:32.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Why do I always have to be
the bad guy?</font>

16:32.738 --> 16:34.406
<font color="#11FF11"> My guess is genetics.</font>

16:35.738 --> 16:37.871
<font color="#FFFF00"> So, that's decided, then, is it?</font>

16:37.872 --> 16:41.272
<font color="#FFFF00"> I get to stay behind,
I get the free pass?</font>

16:41.273 --> 16:44.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> <font color="#FFFF00"> That's right.</font>
And we all agree on that, do we?</font>

16:44.738 --> 16:46.272
<font color="#11FF11"> Of course.</font>

16:46.273 --> 16:47.540
Yeah.

16:48.738 --> 16:49.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> I suppose.</font>

16:49.739 --> 16:52.673
<font color="#FFFF00"> Good. In that case...</font>

16:54.139 --> 16:55.737
<font color="#11FF11"> What are you doing?</font>

16:55.738 --> 16:59.005
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm taking my free pass,
and I'm giving it to Lee.</font>

16:59.006 --> 17:00.871
<font color="#00FFFF"> What?!</font>
What?!</font>

17:00.872 --> 17:02.738
<font color="#11FF11"> What?!</font>

17:03.738 --> 17:05.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> I knew you were terrified
from the start,</font>

17:05.738 --> 17:07.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> ever since we signed up for
all of this.</font>

17:07.738 --> 17:11.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Did you? </font>Lee, you've been waking up
at night in a cold sweat.</font>

17:11.738 --> 17:13.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Last night, he fell out of bed
yanking on the drawstring</font>

17:13.738 --> 17:17.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> of his pyjama bottoms, screaming
about the ripcord not working.</font>

17:18.872 --> 17:20.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> And you still gave me
your free pass,</font>

17:20.739 --> 17:23.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> even though you were so scared,
you hid your parachute.</font>

17:23.738 --> 17:25.737
I suppose that was
pretty brave of me.

17:25.738 --> 17:29.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, tales of true bravery
often start with night terror</font>

17:29.738 --> 17:31.738
<font color="#11FF11"> and damp pyjamas.</font>

17:33.273 --> 17:37.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> So now, I'm returning the favour,
and giving you your free pass back.</font>

17:40.872 --> 17:42.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> See you on the ground, Lee.</font>

17:45.738 --> 17:48.138
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, don't mind us!</font>

17:48.139 --> 17:50.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Ignore Frank.
Keep hugging him, Lucy.</font>

17:50.738 --> 17:53.673
<font color="#11FF11"> You can let go when you hit a tree.</font>

17:58.406 --> 18:00.739
<font color="#FFFF00"> Geronimo!</font>

18:04.738 --> 18:06.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> Chute's opened nicely.</font>

18:09.738 --> 18:12.005
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, gentlemen, who's next?</font>

18:12.006 --> 18:14.138
Good question.

18:14.139 --> 18:16.005
Maybe you should jump together.

18:16.006 --> 18:17.737
You could hold hands, if you like.

18:17.738 --> 18:20.272
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm going nowhere
till I've seen you jump.</font>

18:20.273 --> 18:22.737
Oh, I'm sorry, Geoffrey, did you not
just hear what Lucy said?

18:22.738 --> 18:25.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Yes, I did. She said "Geronimo,"
then jumped from the plane,</font>

18:25.738 --> 18:27.737
<font color="#11FF11"> which means she's no longer here
to protect your cowardly hide!</font>

18:27.738 --> 18:29.738
That's not right,
that's not what was agreed.

18:29.739 --> 18:33.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I don't care. Lucy had no right
to give you that free pass,</font>

18:33.738 --> 18:35.272
<font color="#11FF11"> so now it's up for grabs again.</font>

18:35.273 --> 18:36.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, guys, whose turn is it?</font>

18:36.738 --> 18:38.406
<font color="#11FF11"> I vote for Lee.</font>

18:39.738 --> 18:40.738
Well, I vote for Geoffrey.

18:40.739 --> 18:43.672
<font color="#11FF11"> Frank, it looks like you have
the casting vote.</font>

18:43.673 --> 18:44.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Er...</font>

18:44.738 --> 18:47.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Allow me to explain
the logic of it, Frank.</font>

18:47.738 --> 18:49.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Lee wants to avoid jumping,
I do not.</font>

18:49.738 --> 18:51.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Therefore, if you vote to eject Lee,</font>

18:51.738 --> 18:54.739
<font color="#11FF11"> you effectively guarantee yourself
a safe seat.</font>

18:55.738 --> 18:58.272
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, yeah!</font> <font color="#00FFFF"> Mmm.</font>
Don't listen to him, Dad.

18:58.273 --> 18:59.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Why not? He's making sense.</font>

18:59.738 --> 19:02.138
I know, that's why I don't want you
to listen to him.

19:02.139 --> 19:04.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> You know what to do, Frank. </font>He's
playing mind games with you, Dad.

19:04.738 --> 19:06.737
If I jump, he will turn on you.

19:06.738 --> 19:08.737
At least if you're up against me,
you stand a chance.

19:08.738 --> 19:10.738
Blood's thicker than water,
but I'm thicker than Geoffrey.

19:12.540 --> 19:13.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, gentlemen?</font>

19:13.738 --> 19:15.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> All right...</font>

19:15.738 --> 19:17.139
<font color="#00FFFF"> ..I've decided.</font>

19:18.406 --> 19:19.539
Yes?

19:19.540 --> 19:20.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'M jumping.</font>

19:20.738 --> 19:22.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Are you sure?</font>
Don't talk him out of it!

19:22.738 --> 19:24.737
<font color="#11FF11"> What's changed your mind?</font>

19:24.738 --> 19:26.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, it was something Lee said</font>

19:26.738 --> 19:29.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> about me not being there
to help him down from that tree.</font>

19:29.738 --> 19:33.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> I remember that day, Lee,
and I've always regretted it.</font>

19:33.738 --> 19:36.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> This won't change the past,</font>

19:36.738 --> 19:39.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> but maybe it'll make me
feel better about myself.</font>

19:40.738 --> 19:43.872
<font color="#00FFFF"> Very admirable, Frank.</font>
Thanks, Dad.

19:45.738 --> 19:46.872
<font color="#00FFFF"> Here goes nothing!</font>

19:49.139 --> 19:51.672
<font color="#FFFF00"> Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's in the flask?</font>

19:51.673 --> 19:53.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, just a little bit of
tonic water,</font>

19:53.738 --> 19:55.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> and a load of gin.</font>

19:55.738 --> 19:59.871
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> How much have you had? </font>Oh,
just a nip, to steady me nerves.</font>

19:59.872 --> 20:02.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Plus the one I had
before we took off.</font>

20:02.738 --> 20:05.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> And one or two while you were doing
that training session this morning.</font>

20:05.738 --> 20:07.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Actually, it were three or four.</font>

20:07.738 --> 20:09.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> You've heard of Dutch courage?</font>

20:09.738 --> 20:11.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, I'm filling me clogs!</font>

20:13.006 --> 20:17.138
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, sorry, there's no question of
you jumping out of this plane now.</font>

20:17.139 --> 20:18.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, isn't there?</font>

20:18.738 --> 20:21.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, what a shame!</font>

20:23.673 --> 20:24.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Frank, you bloody idiot!</font>

20:24.738 --> 20:27.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Any fool can work out
that you're not allowed to drink!</font>

20:27.738 --> 20:30.737
Any fool DID work it out!

20:30.738 --> 20:32.737
He had no intention of jumping.

20:32.738 --> 20:34.871
That story about remembering me
up the tree is a load of crap!

20:34.872 --> 20:36.737
<font color="#11FF11"> You don't know that.</font>
Yes, I do,

20:36.738 --> 20:39.738
because I made up the bloody
tree story in the first place!

20:41.738 --> 20:43.737
<font color="#11FF11"> This is truly sickening!</font>

20:43.738 --> 20:48.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Well, the important thing is,
I can't jump,</font>

20:48.738 --> 20:50.539
<font color="#00FFFF"> so you two are going to have to.</font>

20:50.540 --> 20:51.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Packs on, you two.</font>

20:51.738 --> 20:54.737
Well, I can't jump, not after all
that cocaine I snorted this morning.

20:54.738 --> 20:57.405
<font color="#00FFFF"> He didn't snort any cocaine.</font>

20:57.406 --> 20:58.737
Ha-ha! Of course not.

20:58.738 --> 21:00.272
Not in my condition.

21:00.273 --> 21:01.738
Did I tell you I was pregnant?

21:03.273 --> 21:04.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> Think of the sick kiddies.</font>
Oof!

21:06.006 --> 21:09.737
Oh, God!

21:09.738 --> 21:11.737
Well, you win, Geoffrey.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.738
It looks like we're both jumping.

21:15.739 --> 21:17.673
Geoffrey?

21:18.739 --> 21:21.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> I can't.</font>
Why not?

21:23.139 --> 21:25.737
Hang on - are you scared?

21:25.738 --> 21:28.272
<font color="#11FF11"> Of course I'm scared.</font>

21:28.273 --> 21:31.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Who wouldn't be scared? Jumping
out of a tin box, 10,000 feet up,</font>

21:31.738 --> 21:33.871
<font color="#11FF11"> attached to a tent on strings
that's been prepped</font>

21:33.872 --> 21:35.738
<font color="#11FF11"> by Crocodile Bloody Dundee?!</font>

21:39.738 --> 21:41.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm from New Zealand!</font>

21:43.273 --> 21:45.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> But you said you'd done
loads of jumps in the army.</font>

21:45.738 --> 21:47.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, I may have
embellished slightly.</font>

21:47.738 --> 21:51.405
<font color="#11FF11"> That elite team of mine
that didn't exist...</font>

21:51.406 --> 21:52.672
Yes?

21:52.673 --> 21:54.737
<font color="#11FF11"> It didn't exist.</font>

21:54.738 --> 21:56.738
<font color="#11FF11"> I made it up, so you wouldn't think
that I was frightened!</font>

21:56.739 --> 22:00.737
<font color="#11FF11">Was you actually in the army at all?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF"> Of course I was,</font>

22:00.738 --> 22:02.737
<font color="#11FF11"> until I got... discharged.</font>

22:02.738 --> 22:04.737
Well, why were you discharged?

22:04.738 --> 22:07.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Because I wouldn't jump
out of a plane, all right?!</font>

22:07.738 --> 22:10.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I did the basic parachute training,
and then, when my turn came,</font>

22:10.738 --> 22:14.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I simply froze and refused to jump.
They threw me out...</font>

22:14.738 --> 22:16.738
<font color="#11FF11"> ..of the army, not the plane.</font>

22:19.739 --> 22:21.737
If you were so frightened,

22:21.738 --> 22:24.539
why did you agree with all this
in the first place?

22:24.540 --> 22:26.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, peer pressure, same as you.</font>

22:26.738 --> 22:29.138
Yeah, but at least I had a plan
to get out of it.

22:29.139 --> 22:32.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, so did I. I was going to wait
until last, and then...</font>

22:32.738 --> 22:36.005
<font color="#11FF11"> ..slip the instructor &#163;20
to pretend there was a problem</font>

22:36.006 --> 22:38.737
<font color="#11FF11"> with my parachute.
But then you pulled your stunt of</font>

22:38.738 --> 22:41.737
<font color="#11FF11"> hiding a parachute, and a chance to
stay behind became available,</font>

22:41.738 --> 22:45.737
<font color="#11FF11"> so I thought I might as well
take that instead. It seemed...</font>

22:45.738 --> 22:47.138
<font color="#11FF11"> It seemed more dignified.</font>

22:47.139 --> 22:50.737
So why did you give Lucy
the free pass to stay behind?

22:50.738 --> 22:54.539
<font color="#11FF11"> Because I knew she wouldn't take it.
She's far too brave.</font>

22:54.540 --> 22:55.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Oh, you're clever.</font>

22:55.738 --> 22:58.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Yeah, perhaps too clever.
Perhaps I should have gone along</font>

22:58.738 --> 23:01.737
<font color="#11FF11"> with your tactic of living my entire
life as an unthinking alcoholic,</font>

23:01.738 --> 23:02.738
<font color="#11FF11"> I'd have been home and dry!</font>

23:04.540 --> 23:05.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, not dry.</font>

23:07.540 --> 23:10.539
<font color="#FFFF00"> Sorry to hurry you up, guys,
but it is conventional to jump</font>

23:10.540 --> 23:12.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> before the plane
has actually landed.</font>

23:12.738 --> 23:14.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Yeah, come on, you guys.</font>

23:14.738 --> 23:16.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> I'm getting deep vein thrombosis
sat over here.</font>

23:17.738 --> 23:20.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Put your packs on,
I'll be back in a mo.</font>

23:20.738 --> 23:21.738
<font color="#11FF11"> He's gone.</font>

23:21.739 --> 23:24.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Frank, come on. Not got much time.</font>

23:24.738 --> 23:26.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Put the pack on!</font>

23:26.738 --> 23:29.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> You heard the man.
I can't, I've been drinking.</font>

23:29.738 --> 23:32.737
<font color="#11FF11"> How does alcohol impair your ability
to fall out of a doorway?</font>

23:32.738 --> 23:35.737
<font color="#00FFFF">If anything, it improves it!</font>
<font color="#11FF11"> No chance.</font>

23:35.738 --> 23:38.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Look, Frank, you've seen how easy
it is to attach that strap.</font>

23:38.738 --> 23:42.738
<font color="#00FFFF"> Put the parachute on. You can do it!</font>
Don't look him in the eyes, Dad.

23:44.738 --> 23:47.672
LOUD HISSING

23:47.673 --> 23:49.005
<font color="#00FFFF"> What the hell was that?!</font>

23:49.006 --> 23:52.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Guys, I need to tell you something,
and I really need you not to panic.</font>

23:52.738 --> 23:55.737
Well, that ship sailed
a long time ago, mate!

23:55.738 --> 23:59.672
<font color="#FFFF00"> The fact is, we've run into
a slight problem with the plane.</font>

23:59.673 --> 24:02.539
<font color="#FFFF00"> A bird got caught in the engine, and
we're struggling to keep control.</font>

24:02.540 --> 24:03.737
Do you mean we're going to crash?!

24:03.738 --> 24:05.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Well, of course
we're not going to...</font>

24:05.738 --> 24:06.871
<font color="#00FFFF"> We're going to crash!</font>

24:06.872 --> 24:09.872
<font color="#FFFF00"> OK. Now might be time to panic!</font>

24:21.738 --> 24:23.405
<font color="#00FFFF"> Agh!</font>
Agh!

24:23.406 --> 24:25.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Get off, Frank, you can't have it,
you're drunk!</font>

24:25.738 --> 24:28.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> You said being drunk didn't matter,
I could still jump!</font>

24:28.738 --> 24:30.737
<font color="#11FF11"> You're perfectly welcome to jump,</font>

24:30.738 --> 24:31.738
<font color="#11FF11"> just not with a parachute!</font>

24:31.739 --> 24:34.871
Come on, Dad, it's a well-known fact
that drunks never hurt themselves

24:34.872 --> 24:37.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> when they fall.</font>
They do if it's out of an aeroplane!</font>

24:37.738 --> 24:38.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Give it...</font>
Agh!</font>

24:40.540 --> 24:42.405
Agh! <font color="#00FFFF"> Argh! </font>Agh!

24:42.406 --> 24:44.272
I thought you were
too scared to jump!

24:44.273 --> 24:46.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I decided to face up to my fear.</font>

24:46.738 --> 24:48.539
I'm the youngest person here.

24:48.540 --> 24:50.737
No offence, but what have you got
to look forward to?

24:50.738 --> 24:53.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Good luck, chaps! And don't forget,</font>

24:53.738 --> 24:56.406
<font color="#00FFFF"> head between knees
on the crash landing.</font>

24:58.738 --> 25:00.737
Well, that was a waste of
a good parachute,

25:00.738 --> 25:03.006
because if I live to see Dad again,
I'm going to kill him!

25:05.738 --> 25:07.737
Take that off, it's mine!

25:07.738 --> 25:09.405
<font color="#11FF11"> No, it's not.</font>

25:09.406 --> 25:12.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Yours is 10,000 feet down there,
in a private room, on a blue rack.</font>

25:13.738 --> 25:14.738
Oof!

25:14.739 --> 25:16.139
Argh!

25:18.739 --> 25:20.738
<font color="#11FF11"> What am I doing?</font>

25:24.738 --> 25:27.672
I don't know. What ARE you doing?

25:27.673 --> 25:31.005
<font color="#11FF11"> You were right. You've got
far more to live for than I have.</font>

25:31.006 --> 25:33.406
Yeah, two more stamps
for a free latte.

25:34.738 --> 25:38.737
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm not just giving you a parachute,</font>

25:38.738 --> 25:42.871
<font color="#11FF11"> I'm giving Lucy her husband,</font>

25:42.872 --> 25:46.006
<font color="#11FF11"> and I'm giving my grandchildren
their father.</font>

25:47.738 --> 25:51.737
<font color="#11FF11"> Tell Wendy I love her,
and don't tell anyone I was scared.</font>

25:51.738 --> 25:54.737
I'll tell them the truth, Geoffrey.

25:54.738 --> 25:56.737
You've been a hero.

25:56.738 --> 25:58.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Just jump out of the
bloody aeroplane, will you?!</font>

26:00.673 --> 26:01.737
<font color="#11FF11"> And, Lee, promise me one thing.</font>

26:01.738 --> 26:03.139
Anything.

26:04.738 --> 26:06.737
<font color="#11FF11"> If you can...</font>

26:06.738 --> 26:08.739
<font color="#11FF11"> ..try and take out Frank's parachute
on your way down.</font>

26:11.738 --> 26:13.738
As if you even needed to ask!

26:21.738 --> 26:22.738
HE GASPS

26:22.739 --> 26:23.872
Argh!

26:28.738 --> 26:30.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> It's all right, Keith, he's jumped!</font>

26:33.872 --> 26:35.738
<font color="#11FF11"> What's going on?</font>

26:36.738 --> 26:38.539
<font color="#11FF11"> I thought we were going to crash.</font>

26:38.540 --> 26:40.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, and I thought you lot
were never going to jump.</font>

26:40.738 --> 26:42.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> God, the amount of encouragement
it takes sometimes!</font>

26:42.738 --> 26:44.672
<font color="#11FF11"> So, you mean...</font>

26:44.673 --> 26:45.738
<font color="#11FF11"> ..the engine didn't fail?</font>

26:45.739 --> 26:48.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Of course not. What kind of
bargain-basement operation</font>

26:48.738 --> 26:50.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> do you think I'm running?</font>

26:50.738 --> 26:51.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> I'm not Australian!</font>

26:51.739 --> 26:54.737
<font color="#11FF11"> But I thought you didn't want
anyone to jump who'd been drinking.</font>

26:54.738 --> 26:56.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> Yeah, that bit wasn't supposed
to happen.</font>

26:56.738 --> 26:58.539
<font color="#FFFF00"> The man's clearly got a death wish.</font>

26:58.540 --> 27:00.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Well, I wish him every success
with it!</font>

27:02.738 --> 27:05.272
<font color="#11FF11"> So...</font>

27:05.273 --> 27:09.539
<font color="#11FF11"> ..I'm not going to die,
and I don't have to jump.</font>

27:09.540 --> 27:11.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> And you still get to be
the hero of the hour.</font>

27:11.738 --> 27:14.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Oh, I think I can make it last
a lot longer than that!</font>

27:16.738 --> 27:19.737
<font color="#11FF11">Did it work?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00"> Like a dream, mate.</font>

27:19.738 --> 27:22.737
<font color="#FFFF00"> <font color="#00FFFF"> Well done. </font>So why is there
one person still here, then?</font>

27:22.738 --> 27:24.871
<font color="#FFFF00"> We're missing a parachute.
That's the whole reason</font>

27:24.872 --> 27:26.738
<font color="#FFFF00"> this palaver started
in the first place.</font>

27:26.739 --> 27:29.737
<font color="#00FFFF"> Because you're missing a chute?
You should have told me.</font>

27:29.738 --> 27:30.739
<font color="#00FFFF"> I've got a spare one under me seat.</font>

27:32.738 --> 27:35.139
<font color="#00FFFF"> Or "down under," as you Aussies say.</font>

27:42.738 --> 27:43.738
<font color="#11FF11"> Good God!</font>

27:47.738 --> 27:49.737
# We're not going out

27:49.738 --> 27:51.672
# Not staying in

27:51.673 --> 27:54.405
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

27:54.406 --> 27:57.737
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

27:57.738 --> 28:00.737
# We're not going out

28:00.738 --> 28:03.738
# We are not going out. #

28:04.305 --> 28:10.438
