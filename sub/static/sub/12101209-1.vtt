M_I_SForEver

00:20.655 --> 00:22.289
[laughs]

00:22.322 --> 00:24.559
[blasts]

00:26.293 --> 00:30.464
I'm going to destroy
the entire planet.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.800
[laughs]

00:32.834 --> 00:35.269
You are mistaken evil one,

00:35.302 --> 00:36.638
for Chen is here to protect

00:36.671 --> 00:39.239
the kind citizens
of planet Nuwa.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.475
Chen, not you again.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.712
Oh, every time I'm about to
destroy this stupid planet,

00:44.746 --> 00:47.414
you appear, you're
a real party pooper.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.683
You know that?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.251
True, but only if
it's a party of evil.

00:51.285 --> 00:53.755
The goddess Nuwa gave me
this magical medallion

00:53.788 --> 00:57.157
to my grandfather, making
him vow to use its powers

00:57.190 --> 00:59.493
to protect her creations.

00:59.527 --> 01:02.764
My grandfather passed this
medallion down to my father

01:02.797 --> 01:04.599
and he passed it to me.

01:04.632 --> 01:07.535
Along with its powers,
comes the secret charge

01:07.569 --> 01:09.771
to protect Nuwa from evil.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.406
All I want to do
is destroy this world

01:12.439 --> 01:13.808
and everyone who lives in it.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.777
Is that so evil?

01:15.810 --> 01:17.344
Extermination of all life?

01:17.377 --> 01:21.516
Yeah, that's pretty much
like the definition of evil.

01:21.549 --> 01:23.317
I'm trying to think of
something more evil than that,

01:23.350 --> 01:25.319
Aussie, I got nothing.

01:25.352 --> 01:26.253
That is terrible.

01:26.286 --> 01:27.354
Nothing's coming to mind.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.423
Small minded fool.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.827
[upbeat music]

01:42.837 --> 01:44.371
I'll wipe you off the map.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.313
You can't wipe me off the map.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.749
Maps are for places.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.450
I'm a person.

01:56.483 --> 01:59.386
Honestly, don't they teach
you anything at evil school?

02:02.624 --> 02:03.524
[yells]

02:03.558 --> 02:05.258
I'll catch you next time Chen.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.194
[cheers]

02:07.227 --> 02:09.663
The Great Chen, our hero.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.866
Thank you Chen, our hero.

02:11.899 --> 02:12.800
Marry me.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.837
I'm just happy to help.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.371
[Narrator] Thanks for
tuning in once again

02:17.404 --> 02:18.840
for the adventures of Chen

02:18.873 --> 02:21.174
based on actual
historical events.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.243
Don't miss next
week as Chen faces

02:23.276 --> 02:26.380
the malevolent forces
of the swamp beast king.

02:28.850 --> 02:33.320
People of Nuwa, I
will be here for you.

02:34.589 --> 02:35.422
Cut.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.192
Was that one good?

02:39.226 --> 02:41.696
Nice Pandy, really.

02:41.729 --> 02:45.833
But why don't we do just a
few more just for safety.

02:48.301 --> 02:49.169
Take 14.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.205
Pepe of Nua.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.241
Ah, I said Pepe.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.242
Take 27.

02:56.144 --> 02:58.613
People of Nua, forever
will I be with you

02:58.646 --> 03:00.213
to protect you here.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.518
Take 29.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.521
People of Nua, I will
be here to protect you.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.861
- Forever.
- Forever.

03:15.930 --> 03:18.265
Marvelous, that's a wrap.

03:18.298 --> 03:19.734
Hey, how are my scenes?

03:19.767 --> 03:23.538
It took 29 takes, which
is better than 30 takes.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.006
Can't believe he remembered.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.974
That guy is such a joke.

03:27.008 --> 03:28.442
[laughs]

03:28.475 --> 03:29.476
Why do people like
this show so much?

03:31.813 --> 03:33.514
Bud, you were doing so well.

03:33.548 --> 03:35.449
Yeah you know,
it's the 10th season,

03:35.482 --> 03:37.618
so I've pretty much
got this on lock.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.319
So locked in bud.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.488
Hey Duke, as a writer,
would it be too much to ask

03:41.522 --> 03:43.457
for a little depth for me?

03:43.490 --> 03:44.892
Depth, what are
you talking about?

03:44.926 --> 03:48.261
My script is so deep,
lava could come out.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.964
I mean, seriously, this line,

03:49.997 --> 03:52.600
I'm going to destroy
the entire planet.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.701
Ha ha ha.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.268
I mean, how can I say that?

03:55.302 --> 03:56.403
Who says that?

03:56.436 --> 03:59.272
Someone who's going to
destroy a planet says that like

03:59.306 --> 04:02.476
[laughs hysterically]

04:03.443 --> 04:04.879
Sorry.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.247
Wow, that was great the
way you did that Duke.

04:08.516 --> 04:12.553
I liked your ha ha ha
too Bruno either way.

04:12.587 --> 04:14.354
Either way.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.923
You mean what
you'd really prefer

04:15.957 --> 04:19.994
is, I'm going to destroy
this entire planet.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.697
[laughs]

04:22.730 --> 04:26.667
That was, yeah, fantastic.

04:26.701 --> 04:27.702
Fine.

04:27.735 --> 04:28.569
Just one problem.

04:28.603 --> 04:32.607
No villain anywhere
would ever say that.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.543
I'm going to destroy
this entire planet.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.678
[laughs]

04:39.647 --> 04:41.716
I never get tired of
hearing you say that

04:41.749 --> 04:43.618
and that laugh, it
gets better and better.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.319
The laugh is 90%
of the job, son.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.054
You try it.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.957
[laughs]

04:49.991 --> 04:51.559
Try like this.

04:51.592 --> 04:52.927
[laughs]

04:52.960 --> 04:55.696
Wait, there.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.430
[laughs]

04:57.464 --> 04:58.365
Not enough base.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.701
Go lower, like this.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.804
[laughs]

05:02.837 --> 05:03.604
- Sir.
- Not Now Samrott.

05:03.638 --> 05:04.739
But I thought
you'd like to know...

05:04.772 --> 05:07.008
I said not now.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.676
As your treasurer, sir,

05:08.709 --> 05:10.912
I have to point out that
this excursion has cost you

05:10.945 --> 05:12.780
far more than we
can possibly gain

05:12.814 --> 05:16.617
by annexing this tiny planet
into the Treksorian Empire.

05:16.651 --> 05:18.586
Well then as treasurer,
what do you think

05:18.619 --> 05:21.656
would be a better
use of our resources?

05:21.689 --> 05:24.926
Well there's any number of
uprisings in the core system

05:24.959 --> 05:26.093
that could cause...

05:27.128 --> 05:28.796
Uprisings are boring.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.430
They're always over too fast.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.699
Yeah dude, come on.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.634
Rise up and down,
rise up and down.

05:33.668 --> 05:34.669
Where's the fun in that?

05:34.702 --> 05:35.837
Where's the,

05:35.870 --> 05:37.605
[laughs]

05:37.638 --> 05:39.073
I have need Samrott.

05:39.106 --> 05:42.677
I have to explore new
worlds to reach untouched,

05:42.710 --> 05:44.779
unchartered civilizations.

05:44.812 --> 05:48.549
I understand, but if some
of these quests of yours

05:48.583 --> 05:50.383
could help the
empire's bottom line,

05:50.417 --> 05:51.819
we can make several
improvements.

05:51.853 --> 05:53.855
Speaking of improvements,
I'm just not sure

05:53.888 --> 05:56.958
my title as king is big enough.

05:56.991 --> 05:58.125
It's not awful.

05:58.159 --> 05:59.527
King is okay.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.963
I just feel like
we could go bigger.

06:01.996 --> 06:04.065
What about supreme?

06:04.098 --> 06:07.635
I was thinking beloved leader,
president, prime minister

06:07.668 --> 06:09.904
Karuph the Great Grand Poobah.

06:11.105 --> 06:13.541
Your Highness, we
really should move out.

06:13.574 --> 06:14.709
What's the rush?

06:14.742 --> 06:18.012
Well sir, we've mined the
planet down to an empty shell.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.581
Any minute now, it'll implode.

06:22.016 --> 06:23.851
Final lesson son,

06:23.885 --> 06:26.754
always leave the planet
before you destroy it.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.422
Don't fret my boy.

06:29.456 --> 06:32.026
There are still plenty of other
worlds out there to destroy.

06:36.564 --> 06:37.965
So I see the Tom Cat Cruise.

06:37.999 --> 06:41.502
Maybe it wasn't so much
the jumping on the couch

06:41.535 --> 06:43.170
that upset Orca Winfrey.

06:43.204 --> 06:44.906
Maybe it was the fact
she had to buy a new one

06:44.939 --> 06:46.507
after her clothes tore up.

06:48.743 --> 06:50.111
That story is getting so old.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.147
So what?

06:53.180 --> 06:54.682
I tell it so well.

06:54.715 --> 06:57.118
- Yeah, totally.
- Loved it.

07:15.803 --> 07:17.805
I deserve better than this.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.241
Get me an indie
film, a commercial.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.777
And here comes Charles.

07:22.810 --> 07:25.012
Yes, that was who
you think it was.

07:25.046 --> 07:25.913
That's my point.

07:25.947 --> 07:28.916
So stop talking to me
and make some calls.

07:30.952 --> 07:32.987
A little prestige.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.889
Is that too much to ask?

07:34.922 --> 07:37.858
Penny, I have some
tiny script notes.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.194
Hey, we can give notes.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.796
I've got a note for you.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.097
Stick to the script.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.070
He said it was
going to implode.

07:49.103 --> 07:50.538
Just kind of deflated.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.739
We could blow up that planet.

07:51.772 --> 07:52.606
Which one?

07:55.176 --> 07:56.744
[mumbles]

07:56.777 --> 07:57.678
What's wrong?

07:57.712 --> 07:58.779
You love blowing up planets.

07:58.813 --> 08:00.681
I'm just not in the mood.

08:00.715 --> 08:02.984
I mean the death ray
is already charged.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.988
[suspense music]

08:08.189 --> 08:10.057
Two blazers with it.

08:10.091 --> 08:10.925
Fire.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.938
That was okay I guess.

08:23.971 --> 08:24.872
Okay?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.841
I mean the explosion was nice,

08:26.874 --> 08:28.642
but there are no
people to oppress.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.745
No civilizations are destroyed.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.980
It's not personal, you know?

08:33.014 --> 08:35.182
I mean, when I destroy
a celestial body,

08:35.216 --> 08:37.918
I prefer to be teeming
with life first.

08:37.952 --> 08:40.654
Of course, that's slimy
little bean counter

08:40.688 --> 08:43.591
with write that I'm wasting
more imperial resources.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.159
Where is that dimwit anyway?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.028
Sorry, your Highness.

08:47.061 --> 08:48.863
You wanted something?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.164
When I was a young Treksorian,

08:50.197 --> 08:53.167
no one could command more
respect than my father,

08:53.200 --> 08:54.268
the Great Zaso.

08:54.301 --> 08:57.605
The old man smashed me with
a cro lack so many times.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.840
I'm surprised I have
any brain cells left.

08:59.874 --> 09:02.576
Why ever since I was
just a royal sprat,

09:02.610 --> 09:05.146
I've been just Gaga
for excessive violence.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.053
Anyway, Samrott,
here's the thing.

09:12.086 --> 09:13.988
We need another
planet to destroy.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.356
But sire the budget.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.757
We just talked about this.

09:16.791 --> 09:18.626
I know, but look
at my kid over there.

09:18.659 --> 09:20.995
How many trips like this are
we going to have together?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.030
They don't stay
innocent forever.

09:26.033 --> 09:26.834
You're right, sir.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.936
He is adorable.

09:30.171 --> 09:32.807
[screams]

09:32.840 --> 09:35.209
Get it off, get it off.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.945
Look around me,
my pride and joy.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.081
After all, my only son.

09:40.114 --> 09:41.782
Surely your majesty
has not forgotten

09:41.816 --> 09:43.317
that he has another son.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.119
There's also eldest, Crusher.

09:46.387 --> 09:48.289
How did we get here Samrott?

09:48.322 --> 09:50.224
You tried to bring up
kids with good values,

09:50.257 --> 09:54.261
destroying planets, burning
him to the ground, the basics,

09:54.295 --> 09:56.964
and now your firstborn
son, what does he do?

09:56.997 --> 10:00.267
He goes off and joins the
Galactic Peace Foundation.

10:00.301 --> 10:01.635
Where did I go wrong?

10:01.669 --> 10:04.004
It could be just a
phase, your majesty.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.040
That boy's burned
up every second chance

10:06.073 --> 10:07.341
I've ever given him.

10:09.310 --> 10:11.145
Find me a planet Samrott.

10:11.178 --> 10:12.379
Any planet.

10:12.413 --> 10:14.248
Just as long as you
get to destroy it.

10:16.951 --> 10:18.886
I was at the top of my class

10:18.919 --> 10:21.822
at the Nuwa Academy
of Dramatic Arts.

10:21.856 --> 10:25.759
They said, I possessed
a singular talent.

10:25.793 --> 10:28.796
Oh, I know all about
your singular talents.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.098
Well, right now
it's being squandered.

10:31.132 --> 10:33.234
Five years acting
with a cut rate panda

10:33.267 --> 10:35.302
that can't even
remember his lines.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.073
What is it you want from me?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.441
How do we keep you on the show?

10:40.474 --> 10:43.310
I'm tired of
playing the villain.

10:43.344 --> 10:46.247
I want to be the hero.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.381
What?

10:47.414 --> 10:49.250
That's ridiculous.

10:49.283 --> 10:51.285
Who's Pandy supposed to fight?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.320
Fine then, I quit.

10:53.354 --> 10:54.822
Bruno, wait.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.191
Don't you know you're
the most nuanced

10:57.224 --> 10:59.193
villain on screen right now?

10:59.226 --> 11:00.794
Nuanced?

11:00.828 --> 11:03.030
Why do you think
people keep tuning in?

11:03.063 --> 11:05.032
Certainly not for Pandy.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.434
I mean, not just for Pandy.

11:07.468 --> 11:09.036
Come to the premiere tonight.

11:09.069 --> 11:12.206
Watch how the fans react
and tell me I'm wrong.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.274
Well, yes.

11:13.307 --> 11:15.242
This is worth investigating.

11:15.276 --> 11:16.710
You owe it to yourself

11:16.744 --> 11:19.313
as a true vessel of
the dramatic arts.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.349
Finally.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.087
You're really something Penny.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.190
- You okay?
- Sorry.

11:29.223 --> 11:31.859
Bruno's not the only one
with a case of your envy.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.060
What do you mean?

11:33.093 --> 11:34.762
Look at them all.

11:34.795 --> 11:38.465
Real heroes, actual legends.

11:38.499 --> 11:41.468
Then there's me,
the great pretender.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.912
Pandy, you know your dad
left all of this for you.

11:51.946 --> 11:53.414
What's your point?

11:53.447 --> 11:56.050
That he knew what he was
doing when he set all this up.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.285
You make millions
of people happy.

11:58.319 --> 12:00.955
That's not nothing
and you're good.

12:02.524 --> 12:05.059
You really think dad
wanted me the mooch off

12:05.092 --> 12:07.861
family fame and play
out like a hero?

12:07.895 --> 12:11.265
He was a hero and
granddad before him

12:11.298 --> 12:13.033
and great grandma before that.

12:13.067 --> 12:14.835
It's not like that.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.539
I know he was very proud of you

12:17.572 --> 12:19.840
and you remind me
so much of him.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.242
How?

12:21.275 --> 12:22.977
Well you're
quick on your feet.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.478
You understand people.

12:24.512 --> 12:27.748
You get them here and
that's the real talent.

12:28.516 --> 12:30.251
I always wanted
to be like him.

12:30.284 --> 12:32.219
You're getting darn close.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.456
What did you
guys say to Bruno?

12:35.489 --> 12:38.025
Like did you give him
a spinoff or something?

12:38.058 --> 12:41.495
Cause man, I have not
seen anybody that happy

12:41.529 --> 12:43.197
since we were renewed
for our second...

12:43.230 --> 12:47.067
Did I interrupt?

12:47.101 --> 12:48.503
Nothing that can't wait.

12:48.536 --> 12:49.970
Come on Pandy.

12:50.004 --> 12:52.039
Let's go help Duke get
started on the next episode.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.241
Penny, there's
something I want to...

12:57.545 --> 12:59.847
You're watching an MMZ.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.449
Nuwa's prime channel
for entertainment news.

13:02.483 --> 13:05.553
I'm Sylvester,
here to update you

13:05.587 --> 13:08.489
on all the scandal
you can handle.

13:08.523 --> 13:12.493
Word here at the Pandy
generations, 10th season premiere

13:12.527 --> 13:14.862
with a slippery
tip about the show

13:14.895 --> 13:17.298
almost losing its main villain.

13:17.331 --> 13:18.465
Look at them.

13:18.499 --> 13:19.300
This is it.

13:19.333 --> 13:20.901
This is the night.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.504
They really like me.

13:22.537 --> 13:24.972
Us, they like us.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.974
This is really exciting.

13:27.007 --> 13:27.609
Sure is.

13:27.642 --> 13:29.310
What?

13:29.343 --> 13:33.847
I've done this like one or two
dozen times before at least.

13:33.881 --> 13:35.583
Could you let them
enjoy the night?

13:35.617 --> 13:36.718
Fine.

13:36.751 --> 13:41.422
I was just wondering kind of
candy you would like Bruno.

13:43.324 --> 13:46.528
I don't do any
processed sugars.

13:46.561 --> 13:49.330
So maybe just some
sugar free gum.

13:49.363 --> 13:50.397
Sugar free gum.

13:50.431 --> 13:51.265
Yup.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.868
Real life for
the party, right?

13:57.104 --> 13:59.206
You guys are the best.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.376
The fans like me, they like us.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.911
I'd like to breathe.

14:12.654 --> 14:14.021
[cheers]

14:14.054 --> 14:16.290
[applause]

14:39.980 --> 14:42.015
Of course they love him.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.686
He's got the perfect
foil and your villain,

14:44.719 --> 14:46.521
complicated, complex.

14:46.554 --> 14:49.890
The multidimensional heavy
without whom there'd be nothing.

14:52.727 --> 14:56.930
Yeah so we're not exactly
what you would call stars.

14:58.232 --> 15:00.668
Don't worry, you get used to it.

15:04.438 --> 15:07.474
[applause]

15:07.509 --> 15:09.343
How would you
address all the haters

15:09.376 --> 15:11.945
that say you're losing
too much weight?

15:11.979 --> 15:12.680
Lost weight.

15:12.714 --> 15:15.015
Oh, I'm still in shape.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.718
As long as you get
round is a shape.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.654
See, my shirt still doesn't
even cover my tummy.

15:19.687 --> 15:21.221
Any truth to the rumor

15:21.255 --> 15:23.991
the show might end
after this season?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.660
It's up to the fans, not me.

15:25.693 --> 15:29.196
If they want more episodes,
I'm happy to give it to them.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.382
Did you see?

15:48.415 --> 15:50.484
Almost like someone knew
you were going to be here.

15:50.518 --> 15:52.620
You guys set that up?

16:07.468 --> 16:08.570
How was the ride over?

16:08.603 --> 16:09.504
Great.

16:09.537 --> 16:10.705
Nothing more love than a limo.

16:13.541 --> 16:14.475
No, it's cool.

16:14.509 --> 16:16.176
Sit, no big deal.

16:16.210 --> 16:17.177
I'll find a spot.

16:22.584 --> 16:27.589
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you all so much.

16:28.756 --> 16:30.157
I hope you enjoy
our screen tonight

16:30.190 --> 16:32.226
and please remember to
switch off your phones.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.562
We're freedom of
the press people.

16:36.764 --> 16:40.167
And now if you please
a warm round of applause

16:40.200 --> 16:43.303
for our star, Pandy.

16:43.337 --> 16:44.539
[applause]

16:44.572 --> 16:45.640
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

16:45.673 --> 16:46.808
I know my father
would be pleased

16:46.841 --> 16:51.111
to see so many smiling faces
if he were still here with us.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.280
However, I do feel a
spirit of innovation

16:53.313 --> 16:55.449
for entertainment
is here with us,

16:55.482 --> 16:58.118
which is why our studio
recently launched

16:58.151 --> 17:00.187
10 brand new high
powered satellites

17:00.220 --> 17:02.089
to ensure uninterrupted signals

17:02.122 --> 17:04.391
across our entire
television broadcast

17:04.424 --> 17:08.095
and tonight is the first
time they all go live.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.364
[applause]

17:12.398 --> 17:15.569
From what I've been told,
these bad boys are so strong

17:15.603 --> 17:19.507
they could send a signal
across the whole galaxy.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.409
Isn't it true that
you're going to fire Bruno

17:22.442 --> 17:24.746
before the season ends?

17:24.779 --> 17:26.548
I don't know where you
would have heard that.

17:26.580 --> 17:28.550
Things are going
well on the set.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.652
If you don't believe
me, ask Bruno.

17:33.721 --> 17:36.123
MMZ has it from
two unnamed sources

17:36.156 --> 17:37.157
that Bruno will be...

17:37.190 --> 17:38.526
Security, can you.

17:43.731 --> 17:44.532
Hey, watch it.

17:44.566 --> 17:46.099
Let me go.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.569
I have a press pass.

17:48.770 --> 17:51.606
Alrighty, let's
fire up the signal

17:51.639 --> 17:53.373
and get this bad boy started.

17:57.210 --> 18:02.115
People of Nuwa, I will
be here for you forever.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.852
Man, they are so great.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.321
Awesome heroics.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.557
Their news broadcast
are so moving.

18:09.591 --> 18:12.827
Why doesn't our news have a
soundtrack like Pandy does?

18:14.929 --> 18:18.365
You know this planet
shows the news every day

18:18.398 --> 18:22.770
for months at a time, we hear
nothing new from your Pandy.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.674
Almost as if he takes
the entire summer off.

18:26.708 --> 18:29.577
We just don't get all
their broadcast is all.

18:29.611 --> 18:30.878
Our reception is
terrible out here.

18:30.912 --> 18:32.780
I've started to
think what would happen

18:32.814 --> 18:34.348
if your father ever caught wind

18:34.381 --> 18:37.351
of Pandy's power
or his battalion.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.386
It guess it's not all bad.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.923
I'm gonna travel to the
furthest edge of the empire

18:41.956 --> 18:44.358
just to watch Pandy's heroics.

18:44.391 --> 18:46.326
Father would stop at nothing

18:46.360 --> 18:48.395
to get his mitts
on that medallion.

18:51.365 --> 18:52.567
We better hurry
to planet Lehuya

18:52.600 --> 18:55.202
before your father
gets done with it.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.504
That's right.

18:56.537 --> 18:58.305
Fire up the engines.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.375
- We'll be back next week.
- Aye aye sir.

19:16.524 --> 19:18.626
Dad's been busy, I see.

19:19.794 --> 19:21.696
An incoming
transmission from Pandy.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.373
Oh no, it's their news.

19:33.407 --> 19:34.609
That's crazy.

19:34.642 --> 19:36.978
What are they doing
broadcasting it out here?

19:37.011 --> 19:40.247
Sir, if we can get the
transmission out here,

19:40.280 --> 19:40.982
doesn't that mean...

19:41.015 --> 19:43.216
Trecksor can get it too.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.452
Once the old man sees
there's a strong force

19:45.485 --> 19:46.954
for good in the universe.

19:46.988 --> 19:48.723
He'd stop at
nothing to crush it.

19:48.756 --> 19:52.426
We have to warn that planet.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.326
Every second counts.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.564
- Course is set captain.
- Maximum thrust.

19:56.597 --> 19:57.665
Punch it.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.272
Your Highness, your
mother, the queen

20:05.305 --> 20:06.874
insists that you pick
up some yam root milk

20:06.908 --> 20:07.809
on your way back.

20:07.842 --> 20:09.476
I'm king of the Nuwa galaxy.

20:09.510 --> 20:11.445
I refuse to count on her demands

20:11.478 --> 20:14.481
like some zagnerium lapdog.

20:14.515 --> 20:17.451
Ask if she wants
two percent or skim.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.453
I'm getting a strange signal.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.454
Put it on screen.

20:25.793 --> 20:27.595
Make sure my son's not watching.

20:27.628 --> 20:29.362
Unsubscribe to the
channel at once.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.230
Turn it off.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.738
Wait, what is that?

20:36.771 --> 20:38.405
Unknown sir.

20:38.438 --> 20:41.374
The signal is coming to us
from outside Trecksorian space.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.476
Who is that?

20:42.510 --> 20:44.512
Computer says it's
a species known as...

20:44.545 --> 20:45.847
Panda.

20:45.880 --> 20:47.949
That's dolly thing is supposed
to be their protector?

20:47.982 --> 20:50.752
Locate the source of that
signaling and set course at once.

20:50.785 --> 20:52.587
I'm unable to get
any kind of reading

20:52.620 --> 20:53.855
on the object you
asked about sire.

20:53.888 --> 20:55.355
Silence.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.624
I don't care about
energy readings.

20:56.657 --> 20:57.992
Just look at it.

20:58.025 --> 20:59.560
It's beautiful.

20:59.594 --> 21:01.529
It must be be mine.

21:01.562 --> 21:02.930
I'm not sure we can afford

21:02.964 --> 21:04.132
to undertake a
new campaign sire.

21:04.165 --> 21:08.870
I mean you know how the queen
gets when you go overspending.

21:08.903 --> 21:10.605
Don't you worry about that.

21:10.638 --> 21:12.439
When she sees the jewelry
I'm bringing back,

21:12.472 --> 21:14.776
our budget will be the
last thing on our mind.

21:14.809 --> 21:17.612
Patch me in so I can introduce
myself to this Pandy.

21:19.013 --> 21:22.382
You'll never stop me Pandy.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.885
[laughs]

21:23.918 --> 21:25.086
Really?

21:25.119 --> 21:26.754
What's gonna make this
time so different?

21:26.788 --> 21:28.623
This time I've set up bombs

21:28.656 --> 21:30.558
in a dozen major
capitol buildings.

21:30.591 --> 21:33.694
I've hung up busload of orphans
off the main street bridge.

21:33.728 --> 21:37.330
Oh, and that girl
you met last week,

21:37.364 --> 21:39.634
I've tied her to
the train tracks.

21:39.667 --> 21:40.968
You fiend.

21:41.002 --> 21:44.639
Yes, I'm fiendish and
evil, but I'm also complex

21:44.672 --> 21:47.340
and have a most
compelling backstory.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.609
Another time.

21:48.643 --> 21:50.645
Right now, I have
to go save the day.

21:52.580 --> 21:53.413
What does that mean?

21:53.446 --> 21:54.649
He pressed the button.

21:54.682 --> 21:56.951
Was this supposed to happen?

21:56.984 --> 21:59.419
I don't remember shooting this.

21:59.452 --> 22:00.688
Relax everyone.

22:00.721 --> 22:02.757
It's just a slight
technical problem.

22:02.790 --> 22:04.058
We'll have it all
fixed in a minute.

22:04.091 --> 22:06.359
Who is this life
form they call Pandy?

22:07.695 --> 22:08.629
Down here.

22:08.663 --> 22:11.866
You're not like a really
enthused fan, are you?

22:11.899 --> 22:14.434
I'm King Karoth,
the destroyer.

22:14.467 --> 22:16.637
Ruler, tyrant and
all around big trees

22:16.671 --> 22:18.105
from the Treksorian Empire.

22:18.139 --> 22:19.607
Is this a press stunt?

22:19.640 --> 22:23.476
Hi, this is my producer Penny.

22:24.779 --> 22:26.714
I've traveled the
galaxy to find you.

22:26.747 --> 22:29.750
I was greatly impressed
by your explosive powers.

22:29.784 --> 22:31.986
Thanks, I get that a lot.

22:32.019 --> 22:34.522
But you know, really
it's a team effort.

22:34.555 --> 22:35.823
And modest too.

22:35.857 --> 22:37.925
Slaying you will be an
honor I intend to savor.

22:37.959 --> 22:39.426
No, seriously.

22:39.459 --> 22:40.728
The honors is all...

22:40.761 --> 22:43.531
Slay me?

22:43.564 --> 22:46.801
A fair fight to the death
of course, but you'll lose.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.769
To be honest, I
never fight fair.

22:48.803 --> 22:50.437
Hold on.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.739
I think there's something
you're not getting.

22:51.772 --> 22:55.676
You realize that this
is just a show, right?

22:55.710 --> 22:57.511
It's all made up.

22:57.545 --> 22:58.546
Entertainment.

22:58.579 --> 22:59.547
I'm not a fighter.

22:59.580 --> 23:00.413
I'm an actor.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.716
Silence.

23:01.749 --> 23:04.018
I will not be mocked by
lesser beings such as you.

23:04.051 --> 23:06.821
My flagship is in high orbit.

23:06.854 --> 23:09.724
My troops are sending
even as we speak.

23:09.757 --> 23:10.958
Prepare for battle.

23:10.992 --> 23:14.095
Your show is about
to be preempted.

23:14.128 --> 23:15.863
Whoa, yes.

23:17.031 --> 23:18.465
Got them good with
that last line.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.700
Did you hear?

23:19.734 --> 23:21.434
They were calling it
a show, so I said,

23:21.468 --> 23:23.738
hey, your show's
getting preempted.

23:23.771 --> 23:26.841
I think preempted is just
temporarily interrupted.

23:26.874 --> 23:28.142
He's right dad.

23:28.175 --> 23:29.877
If you wanted to say the
show's ending permanently,

23:29.911 --> 23:31.879
you should've been
like, I'm canceling you

23:31.913 --> 23:34.148
or I'm pulling the plug.

23:34.181 --> 23:35.049
Are you sure?

23:36.217 --> 23:37.885
In that case, what
I said was lame.

23:37.919 --> 23:39.587
Okay, fine.

23:39.620 --> 23:41.889
Reconnect me and I'll work
to plug pulling line in.

23:41.923 --> 23:44.759
I'm afraid you
never gave the order

23:44.792 --> 23:46.093
to disconnect your majesty.

23:46.127 --> 23:46.961
What are you saying?

23:46.994 --> 23:49.697
We're still connected?

23:49.730 --> 23:51.431
They're hearing
everything we say.

23:59.006 --> 24:04.011
I swear to Nuwa,
I didn't write that.

25:01.202 --> 25:02.203
Excuse me.

25:03.237 --> 25:04.572
Excuse me.

25:05.239 --> 25:06.073

25:08.175 --> 25:09.510

25:18.052 --> 25:21.989
Please can you tell
us where Pandy is?

25:22.023 --> 25:24.058
Hang on Crusher, I think
yours got switched off.

25:24.091 --> 25:26.127
We need Pandy's help fast.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.828
Where can he be?

25:27.862 --> 25:29.030

25:29.063 --> 25:31.932
Did you do just say
you need his help?

25:31.966 --> 25:32.867
Listen to me.

25:32.900 --> 25:36.103
You hear me in your
native language, right?

25:36.137 --> 25:37.571
Just wait, listen.

25:37.605 --> 25:39.040
We're not part of this thing.

25:39.073 --> 25:40.608
We're trying to help.

25:49.083 --> 25:50.117

In the meantime, we need
you to help us find Pandy?

25:59.660 --> 26:02.196
Hey, little brother, how's Dad?

26:02.229 --> 26:03.230
Oh, he's great.

26:03.264 --> 26:04.265
I'm his favorite now.

26:04.298 --> 26:05.699
We laugh together all the time.

26:05.733 --> 26:08.135
Turns out laughing is
like 90% of the job.

26:08.169 --> 26:09.336

26:09.370 --> 26:11.038
I'm so sorry.

26:11.072 --> 26:13.774
I couldn't have been there
Martin, but I'm here now

26:13.808 --> 26:15.709
and I'm going to stop Dad.

26:15.743 --> 26:17.078
You're not going to stop him.

26:17.111 --> 26:18.145
I'm going to find Pandy,

26:18.179 --> 26:19.814
Dad's going to get him

26:19.847 --> 26:22.016

medallion back to grandma.

very good name aim.

27:21.142 --> 27:21.942

[dramatic music]

27:49.837 --> 27:50.671
Pandy.

27:54.241 --> 27:55.209
Get away from me.

27:55.242 --> 27:56.744
Oh for the love of...

27:58.279 --> 27:59.747
I'm not with them.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.322
Why didn't you use the amulet?

28:08.355 --> 28:10.758
I keep telling you
guys it's not real.

28:10.791 --> 28:12.293
It's a TV show.

28:13.327 --> 28:14.795
Brother, betrayer.

28:18.799 --> 28:20.334
We gotta get you out of here.

28:23.505 --> 28:24.939
I can't believe it.

28:24.972 --> 28:27.374
This is the worst
season premiere.

28:29.143 --> 28:30.811
Driver, why are you stopping?

28:30.844 --> 28:32.746
- The freeway is down.
- What?

28:32.780 --> 28:34.848
You mean the whole
freeway's closed?

28:34.882 --> 28:38.185
[Driver] More like the
entire freeway is down.

28:39.286 --> 28:40.754
Take us back the other way.

28:44.458 --> 28:45.359
Let me go.

28:45.392 --> 28:46.393
You're one of the aliens.

I'm a good alien.

But my friends.

You're the one King Karoth
wants to kill, remember.

29:09.350 --> 29:11.218
Hurry, hide please.

29:11.252 --> 29:12.086
Where?

29:13.087 --> 29:13.921
Where?

29:35.109 --> 29:36.277
Didn't I tell
you to stay hidden?

29:36.310 --> 29:38.445
Forget you ape, I'm leaving.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.443
It takes a while to
get your space legs kid.

30:42.476 --> 30:44.044
There is a 50, 50 chance

30:44.078 --> 30:46.614
I might puke in the
next five minutes.

30:46.648 --> 30:47.582
That's fine.

30:47.615 --> 30:49.083
There's only a 50, 50 chance

30:49.116 --> 30:51.519
we'll survive the
next five minutes.

30:52.687 --> 30:53.487
Target that cruiser.

30:53.521 --> 30:55.657
Take down my brother's
cruiser at once.

30:55.690 --> 30:56.591
Take it down now.

31:00.194 --> 31:01.462
That didn't take long.

31:01.495 --> 31:04.898
Shoot to cripple them
but don't destroy them.

31:07.702 --> 31:11.905
Invasive maneuvers.

31:24.485 --> 31:25.319
We're hit.

31:26.186 --> 31:30.190
Slow down.

31:33.260 --> 31:37.264
Now.

31:56.283 --> 31:57.351
Hang on everyone.

32:03.691 --> 32:04.925
It's my brother.

32:05.693 --> 32:08.061

32:08.095 --> 32:09.697

32:45.365 --> 32:47.669
- Initiate protocol CBH.
- Copy that.

[dramatic music]

33:31.211 --> 33:32.312
We're hit.

33:32.346 --> 33:33.781
- How bad?
- Bad.

Everything.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.793
Rollins confirms it sir.

34:19.827 --> 34:20.762
The ship's a complete loss.

34:22.396 --> 34:23.731
So it's totaled.

34:23.764 --> 34:25.567
Well, we just call
the insurance company

34:25.600 --> 34:27.501
and phone for a limo, right.

34:28.636 --> 34:30.237
I could go for a jacuzzi.

34:30.270 --> 34:33.340
You know, that would
have been a dynamite chance

34:33.373 --> 34:37.110
to help us out with
that medallion of yours.

34:37.143 --> 34:38.780
You could have
shielded the ship.

34:39.781 --> 34:41.783
You could have swatted
those ships out of the sky.

34:41.815 --> 34:43.618
How many times do I
have to tell you people

34:43.650 --> 34:45.719
it's a TV show.

34:53.260 --> 34:56.163
I mean, I'm a veritable
fountain of ideas

34:56.196 --> 34:58.800
in the writer's room, but
this is the real thing.

34:58.833 --> 34:59.601
What do we do?

34:59.634 --> 35:00.868
I don't know.

35:00.902 --> 35:02.704
Our best friend is
out there somewhere.

35:02.737 --> 35:04.438
Did you try giving him a call?

35:05.607 --> 35:07.240
- Hey there.
- Hey.

Pandy of Pandy generations.

changed since season three.

35:13.548 --> 35:15.750
Can we officially panic now?

35:15.783 --> 35:17.317
Oh, that idiot.

35:17.351 --> 35:18.185
What could he?

35:22.957 --> 35:25.492
Right, we have to go find him.

35:25.526 --> 35:29.262
Go, you mean go outside?

35:29.296 --> 35:30.297
We have to.

35:30.330 --> 35:31.532
Don't worry.

35:31.566 --> 35:32.934
We're in plenty
of actual danger,

35:32.967 --> 35:34.401
so there will be chances

35:34.434 --> 35:36.604
for all of your panic
monologues along the way.

35:44.846 --> 35:46.446

35:46.480 --> 35:47.782
He built all this.

35:47.815 --> 35:50.250
He had a plan for everything.

35:50.283 --> 35:51.886
Now we're an actual danger

35:51.919 --> 35:54.689
and all we've got is one
missing superstar and...

[screams]

36:05.465 --> 36:08.569
My child, if you're
reading this,

36:08.603 --> 36:10.203
then the worst has happened

36:10.237 --> 36:13.273
and the medallion's
power is needed again.

36:13.306 --> 36:16.944
The medallion is tuned
to our bloodline,

36:16.978 --> 36:20.347
but it can be used by others.

36:20.380 --> 36:23.685
Do not let it fall
into the wrong hands.

36:25.753 --> 36:28.656
Its power will need
time to awaken.

36:28.690 --> 36:29.957
Keep it safe.

36:30.858 --> 36:32.359
Oh my Nuwa.

36:32.392 --> 36:33.628
The legends are true.

36:33.661 --> 36:36.396
Wait, you're telling
me that all these stories

36:36.430 --> 36:39.634
about adventures and
Pandy's ancestors.

36:46.306 --> 36:48.475
I don't think
they're just stories.

36:48.509 --> 36:52.446
I think we follow it
where it wants us to go.

36:52.479 --> 36:55.516
We find Pandy so
we can save Nuwa.

36:56.718 --> 36:57.618
Let's go.

37:06.994 --> 37:07.829
Where the heck
have you taken me?

37:07.862 --> 37:09.396
Well I don't know.

37:09.429 --> 37:10.497
How would I know.

37:10.531 --> 37:11.532
It's your planet.

37:11.566 --> 37:12.834
Don't talk to me like that.

37:12.867 --> 37:14.401
You're the ones who abducted me.

37:14.434 --> 37:17.505
We saved your life
you big ungrateful bear.

37:17.538 --> 37:19.774
So you expect me to believe
that the exact same time

37:19.807 --> 37:23.044
that this huge swarm of
alien invaders arrive,

37:23.077 --> 37:27.447
a foursome of good
aliens show up to help?

37:27.481 --> 37:29.316
[Group] Yes.

37:29.349 --> 37:31.886
We came to stop my father.

37:31.919 --> 37:32.720
What?

37:32.754 --> 37:33.888
Your father?

37:33.921 --> 37:35.388
Your dad is leading
the invasion?

37:35.422 --> 37:39.060
Meet Prince Crusher,
deposed son of King Kharouf.

37:39.093 --> 37:42.997
- Deposed?
- Well, she's exaggerating.

37:43.030 --> 37:48.035
My family, I just don't
support what he does.

37:49.469 --> 37:50.370
Yikes.

37:50.403 --> 37:52.740
I bet family reunions
or a barrel of laughs.

37:52.774 --> 37:54.609
Feeling alright Pandy?

37:54.642 --> 37:56.778
Sorry, you just
look so different.

37:56.811 --> 37:59.614
You look like a gorilla that
fell into a vat of grape juice.

37:59.647 --> 38:04.652
So to us you look like
a overfed glass norm.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.487
[laughs]

38:07.522 --> 38:08.956
- It's true, you do.
- Indeed.

38:08.990 --> 38:11.592
Your appearance would be quite
comical on Treksor prime.

38:11.626 --> 38:14.361
So we're not on
Treksor prime, are we?

38:14.394 --> 38:16.564
No, we just look different.

38:16.597 --> 38:18.465
I'm saying when we get
back to civilization,

38:18.498 --> 38:21.035
folks might think you're
with the bad guys.

38:21.068 --> 38:22.670
Take it the wrong way.

38:22.703 --> 38:25.840
We crashed from over there,
so let's get a move on.

time, neither could we.

I'm looking for a bear, Pandy.

39:14.722 --> 39:16.591
Recognize his life form?

39:16.624 --> 39:18.125
It's hard to tell.

39:18.159 --> 39:19.894
It's a black and white photo.

39:19.927 --> 39:22.797
It's a color photo, but
it's a black and white bear.

39:23.731 --> 39:24.966
In exchange for information

39:24.999 --> 39:26.767
leading to his
successful capture,

39:26.801 --> 39:28.803
I would gladly
grant your freedom.

39:28.836 --> 39:30.638
Excuse me, down here.

39:30.671 --> 39:32.707
I don't know where Pandy is,

39:32.740 --> 39:35.676
but I do know someone who might.

39:35.710 --> 39:36.878
You look familiar.

39:36.911 --> 39:37.712
I know, I know.

39:37.745 --> 39:38.713
I get that a lot.

39:38.746 --> 39:40.748
I'm in entertainment.

39:40.781 --> 39:42.016
Various roles.

39:43.117 --> 39:45.452
You're that...

39:45.485 --> 39:47.521
No, seriously, no points
training yourself to remember.

39:47.555 --> 39:49.090
- I just...
- Set up bombs.

39:49.123 --> 39:52.059
Suspended a whole bus of
children from a bridge.

39:52.093 --> 39:53.694
Guards, remove this prisoner.

39:53.728 --> 39:56.063
- No, no, please.
- Silence.

39:56.097 --> 39:58.666
I need to set an example
before my subjects

39:58.699 --> 40:00.467
so this will never happen again.

40:00.500 --> 40:02.203
Oh, good lord, no.

40:02.236 --> 40:05.206
I want an immediate
flogging of whoever it was

40:05.239 --> 40:07.708
that put this fellow behind bars

40:07.742 --> 40:10.845
while failing to
recognize his evil genius.

40:10.878 --> 40:12.546
This is no ordinary ape.

40:12.580 --> 40:14.916
This is Bruno,
archenemy of Pandy

40:14.949 --> 40:18.586
and future cold ruler of
this entire trivial planet

40:18.619 --> 40:21.722
along with Treksor,
if you're available.

40:21.756 --> 40:23.858
So let me get this straight.

40:23.891 --> 40:27.728
You want me to betray
my co-star of five years

40:27.762 --> 40:31.098
in exchange for power,
respect and prestige?

40:32.800 --> 40:33.834
Yes.

40:37.805 --> 40:38.673
I'm your man,

[dramatic music]

40:46.047 --> 40:48.182
[panting]

41:01.128 --> 41:01.929
Oh boy.

41:01.963 --> 41:02.897
What happened?

41:02.930 --> 41:03.831
I don't know.

41:03.864 --> 41:06.200
It just stopped.

41:06.233 --> 41:08.970
The note said it would
need time to recharge.

41:13.975 --> 41:18.079
Look, if it's not working
anymore, we might as well rest.

41:18.112 --> 41:19.847
Let's head back to the office.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.849
It's got to be
almost dawn anyway.

41:26.253 --> 41:28.856
- Penny.
- Morning, Duke.

41:28.889 --> 41:31.892
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, just fine.

41:31.926 --> 41:32.994
Yeah, me too.

41:33.661 --> 41:35.930
I have $1,000 mattress at home,

41:35.963 --> 41:37.865
but this was honestly
some of the best...

41:42.870 --> 41:44.705
This is just a bad dream.

41:44.739 --> 41:46.073
That's all it is.

41:46.107 --> 41:47.141
I'm going to pass back out

41:47.174 --> 41:48.943
and wake up and my $1,000 bed

41:48.976 --> 41:51.679
looking forward to another
12 hour day at the studio.

41:52.980 --> 41:55.149
Oh, a sleeping mask.

41:55.182 --> 41:56.250
How kind of you?

41:56.283 --> 41:57.885
It's a blindfold Penny.

41:57.918 --> 42:01.255
They're taking us somewhere
else, so just put it on, okay?

42:13.267 --> 42:16.604
Hey now there is a great tune.

42:16.637 --> 42:19.907
Squarely Mendez
in Brazil met 66.

42:19.940 --> 42:21.976
Quality nova.

42:23.110 --> 42:26.814
Look, I'm just trying to
upgrade everyone's music taste.

42:29.950 --> 42:33.254
Duke, is that you and Penny?

42:33.287 --> 42:34.255
How?

42:34.288 --> 42:36.123
Take off those blindfolds.

42:36.157 --> 42:37.358
Bruno?

42:37.391 --> 42:39.026
I just realized
how awkward this is

42:39.060 --> 42:41.962
considering how much trash
you talked about my script

42:41.996 --> 42:43.831
and then there was this rumor

42:43.864 --> 42:45.366
about you getting
fired from the show.

42:45.399 --> 42:46.200
It's okay.

42:46.233 --> 42:47.701
I'm completely over it.

42:47.735 --> 42:50.237
Good, because I
was still wondering

42:50.271 --> 42:52.940
what the exact problem was
that you had with my writing.

42:52.973 --> 42:55.076
Hey, we've worked together
for almost 10 years.

42:55.109 --> 42:57.011
Bruno is family.

42:59.013 --> 43:01.115
Yeah, family.

43:08.089 --> 43:10.091
It is crazy hot.

43:15.062 --> 43:16.931
Wow, what was that?

43:16.964 --> 43:20.301
We all have our own
special abilities.

43:20.334 --> 43:23.104
Gliders got a fire in her belly.

43:23.137 --> 43:25.906
Do you have to
use the word belly?

43:25.940 --> 43:27.074
You're like superheros?

43:27.108 --> 43:29.009
You're the real thing.

43:29.043 --> 43:30.678
It's just like you Crusher.

43:30.711 --> 43:31.846
Please.

43:31.879 --> 43:33.147
Wait, wait, Blaster,
what can you do?

43:33.180 --> 43:35.816
Water blasts, laser blasts.

43:35.850 --> 43:39.753
Wait, wait, communication
with the deep ones, right?

43:39.787 --> 43:41.822
Okay, I can take a hint.

43:41.856 --> 43:43.057
So what's the plan?

43:43.090 --> 43:44.925
How are we going to
fight your father?

43:44.959 --> 43:47.061
That is not our
priority right now.

43:47.094 --> 43:48.395
What's our priority?

43:49.997 --> 43:50.931
Surviving.

43:59.974 --> 44:02.143
This is most tiresome.

44:02.176 --> 44:03.377
Right?

44:03.410 --> 44:06.313
And all this sand,
it gets everywhere.

44:06.347 --> 44:09.250
Say Rollins,
what's your secret?

44:12.820 --> 44:14.155
Right, me too.

44:20.261 --> 44:23.164
Hey Glider can you fly up and
see how far we have to go?

44:24.331 --> 44:27.067
Now that, that
gives me an idea.

44:27.101 --> 44:30.838
Rollins, can you fly up
and see how far have to go?

44:37.244 --> 44:39.079
[buzzing]

44:39.113 --> 44:40.214
What?

44:40.247 --> 44:41.248
No sign of anything?

44:41.282 --> 44:42.082
That's impossible.

44:42.116 --> 44:43.250
Nothing in a distance?

44:43.284 --> 44:44.818
Let me fly up.

44:44.852 --> 44:46.720
Be my guest.

44:46.754 --> 44:49.190
I mean, fly me
up from my planet.

44:49.223 --> 44:53.027
I should be able to
recognize something, I hope.

44:57.331 --> 44:59.233
[screams]

45:00.901 --> 45:02.336
You're one strong bug.

45:04.071 --> 45:06.240
Rollins is a side fax.

45:06.273 --> 45:07.341
Don't be rude.

45:08.275 --> 45:09.310
Sorry.

45:15.783 --> 45:18.152
- Bruno.
- Oh yeah.

45:18.185 --> 45:19.954
So as I made my way to
the city under attack,

45:19.987 --> 45:23.791
I found myself looking
for a way to fight back,

45:23.824 --> 45:27.294
a resistance, this is my team.

45:27.328 --> 45:30.197
Okay, granted they're not
much to look at right now.

45:38.339 --> 45:40.107
What have you two been up to?

45:40.140 --> 45:41.475
We're looking for Pandy.

45:41.509 --> 45:42.910
Is that a prop?

45:42.943 --> 45:45.112
Say hello to the
genuine article.

45:45.145 --> 45:46.380
Chen's medallion.

45:46.413 --> 45:48.249
That thing that's
been collecting dust

45:48.282 --> 45:49.850
in your office for years.

45:49.883 --> 45:52.086
Yes and right now we think

45:52.119 --> 45:54.188
it's trying to lead
us back to Pandy.

45:54.221 --> 45:56.223
It can't fall into
the wrong hands.

45:56.257 --> 45:58.292
No, it absolutely can't.

45:58.325 --> 45:59.326
What are we waiting for?

45:59.360 --> 46:02.129
[mellow music]

46:09.937 --> 46:12.306
You know, this reminds me
of that season two episode

46:12.339 --> 46:13.508
where Pandy loses the medallion

46:13.541 --> 46:15.142
and winds up lost in the jungle.

46:15.175 --> 46:18.412
So his friends use the
medallion to find him again.

46:18.445 --> 46:19.813
I remember.

46:19.847 --> 46:21.115
Life imitating art.

46:21.148 --> 46:23.350
Well put sir Bruno.

46:23.384 --> 46:25.419
Any idea what else
this thing can do?

46:25.452 --> 46:28.590
It didn't exactly come
with an instruction manual.

46:28.623 --> 46:33.827
It's supposed to be tuned to
Pandy, whatever that means.

46:34.495 --> 46:36.163
But anyone can still use it.

46:36.196 --> 46:38.198
Otherwise, why can't it
fall into the wrong hands?

46:38.232 --> 46:40.200
You're probably right.

46:40.234 --> 46:41.569
We don't know how it works.

46:41.603 --> 46:42.803
May I?

46:43.571 --> 46:44.405
Sure.

46:48.309 --> 46:50.311
That's really something.

46:50.344 --> 46:52.079
Right?

46:52.112 --> 46:54.348
It feels like you're
holding a live wire.

46:54.381 --> 46:56.350
Stubborn thing, isn't it?

46:58.018 --> 46:59.453
[gasps]

46:59.486 --> 47:02.356
Surrender now or be destroyed.

47:02.389 --> 47:03.558
Duke, no.

47:03.591 --> 47:05.893
Hey, I've got a
career to think about.

47:05.926 --> 47:08.362
They probably have TV
shows I could addition for.

47:08.395 --> 47:10.864
Nobody's
surrendering anything.

47:10.898 --> 47:11.899
Very well.

47:11.932 --> 47:13.067
We don't need you to be alive

47:13.100 --> 47:14.968
to take the medallion from you.

47:15.002 --> 47:15.836
Fire.

47:18.138 --> 47:19.273
More powerful than I thought.

47:19.306 --> 47:21.375
Fortunately, I
got an inside man.

47:26.681 --> 47:29.917
These things are worse
than studio executives.

47:29.950 --> 47:30.851
Get them off me.

47:44.599 --> 47:47.201
Retreat, retreat.

47:47.234 --> 47:50.371
They were aliens in disguise?

47:50.404 --> 47:53.273
Those sneaky rats.

47:56.611 --> 47:58.078
See anything Pandy.

47:58.112 --> 47:59.213
Yeah, there's
all kinds of stuff.

47:59.246 --> 48:04.451
There's abandoned car, some
kind of dead decaying body.

48:04.485 --> 48:05.587
I feel better already.

48:05.620 --> 48:06.987
Give him a minute.

48:07.020 --> 48:10.190
Oh wow, vultures
are eating it.

48:10.224 --> 48:11.559
Anything else Pandy?

48:11.593 --> 48:14.461
Well sand.

48:14.495 --> 48:16.163
We're so dead.

48:18.666 --> 48:21.068
Oh wait, I know where we are.

48:21.101 --> 48:23.337
The the windy spinny things.

48:23.370 --> 48:25.507
We were out here
shooting an episode.

48:25.540 --> 48:27.441
The freeway's right
over that hill.

48:27.474 --> 48:29.443
I can't see it,
but I'm sure of it.

48:29.476 --> 48:30.545
It's right past that.

48:31.646 --> 48:33.648
[yells]

48:38.553 --> 48:40.187
What's happened?

48:40.220 --> 48:41.054
What is it?

48:42.289 --> 48:43.490
It just shut off.

48:43.525 --> 48:45.660
It's not doing anything now.

48:45.693 --> 48:47.961
Maybe you used up its charge.

48:47.995 --> 48:51.098
How'd you make it do those
things with the force field?

48:51.131 --> 48:52.567
I don't know.

48:52.600 --> 48:53.701
I wasn't thinking at all.

48:53.735 --> 48:56.437
I was just scared then angry.

48:56.470 --> 48:59.741
Maybe it responds to
feelings, not thoughts.

48:59.774 --> 49:02.677
Well, whatever it does,
it's not doing it now.

49:02.710 --> 49:05.647
Well, how the heck are we
supposed to find Pandy now?

49:21.663 --> 49:23.063
Keep it down.

49:23.096 --> 49:24.998
We don't want to be spotted.

49:25.032 --> 49:28.235
Relax, I'm on an
important mission here.

49:40.380 --> 49:41.649
Hungry?

49:41.683 --> 49:44.017
I could eat a
Treksorian horse.

49:46.286 --> 49:48.288
Guess the place is closed.

49:48.322 --> 49:49.624
I don't think they ever close.

49:54.596 --> 49:56.764
Pulling up my sleeve, Carl.

49:56.798 --> 50:00.033
I'm doing a live report
on the alien invasion.

50:00.067 --> 50:01.636
What could possibly be?

50:04.639 --> 50:07.675
Oh, a celebrity cut
the invasion feed.

50:07.709 --> 50:09.577
This is real news.

50:10.645 --> 50:14.549
Hey Pandy, Sylvester from MMZ.

50:15.683 --> 50:18.720
This is Sylvester with MMZ news

50:18.753 --> 50:20.822
reporting on superstar Pandy

50:20.855 --> 50:23.457
who has sunk to
begging for handouts.

50:23.490 --> 50:24.726
We're not looking
for handouts.

50:24.759 --> 50:26.326
We were going to buy everything.

50:26.360 --> 50:29.229
Precisely and at
a time like this,

50:29.263 --> 50:31.231
all you can think about is food.

50:31.265 --> 50:33.166
Can you explain
it to our viewers?

50:33.200 --> 50:35.235
What puts you above the law?

50:35.269 --> 50:38.205
The press will not be denied.

50:40.240 --> 50:41.408
I think you just were.

50:42.276 --> 50:45.747
Hey, you have high
fives on your planet?

50:45.780 --> 50:47.682
Everybody has high fives.

50:55.523 --> 50:57.525
[snorts]

50:59.326 --> 51:01.194
Dad, I sent you a text.

51:01.228 --> 51:02.162
Do you ever check?

51:02.195 --> 51:03.463
It was terrible.

51:03.497 --> 51:07.301
They used force to
protect themselves.

51:07.334 --> 51:08.435
The very nerve.

51:08.468 --> 51:11.639
I know they had an even
stronger force than our force.

51:11.673 --> 51:12.807
They used the medallion.

51:12.840 --> 51:14.642
This sounds expensive.

51:14.676 --> 51:15.843
You're not kidding.

51:15.877 --> 51:17.879
Now I need new soldiers
and new armor and...

51:17.912 --> 51:18.713
Silence.

51:18.746 --> 51:20.147
What about Bruno?

51:20.180 --> 51:21.381
He's still down
there with them.

51:21.415 --> 51:23.350
Maybe he's really
a triple agent.

51:23.383 --> 51:26.588
On the contrary, he's
playing the long game.

51:26.621 --> 51:28.422
Learning the strengths
of the medallion,

51:28.455 --> 51:30.758
waiting for the opportune
moment to strike.

51:30.792 --> 51:32.359
- Your majesty.
- What?

51:32.392 --> 51:33.427
News of the target.

51:33.460 --> 51:34.596
Put it on screen.

51:34.629 --> 51:38.700
On superstar Pandy who has
sunk to begging for handouts.

51:38.733 --> 51:40.133
We're not looking
for handouts.

51:40.167 --> 51:41.603
We were going to buy everything.

51:41.636 --> 51:42.704
Precisely.

51:42.737 --> 51:44.471
My no good exile of a son

51:44.505 --> 51:48.543
has banded together with that
sorry excuse for a panda.

51:48.576 --> 51:49.877
It is time I entered the fray.

51:58.185 --> 52:00.788
You know we really
shouldn't steal.

52:01.689 --> 52:02.924
Don't worry.

52:02.957 --> 52:05.292
I have an account with
every grocer in town.

52:05.325 --> 52:06.661
I'll just leave a note.

52:06.694 --> 52:08.563
They'll put it on my tab.

52:09.597 --> 52:10.932
You would buy us this food?

52:10.965 --> 52:12.700
Least I can do.

52:12.734 --> 52:14.501
It's about the only
thing I can do.

52:15.770 --> 52:18.539
[dramatic music]

52:31.418 --> 52:33.186
This is delicious.

52:49.671 --> 52:50.571
It's vegetarian.

52:53.741 --> 52:55.510
You guys don't have food
like this on your planet?

52:55.543 --> 52:56.511
[laughs]

52:56.544 --> 52:58.579
Nothing that tastes this good.

52:58.613 --> 53:01.816
This planet might have
some perks after all.

53:01.849 --> 53:04.217
[belches]

53:05.553 --> 53:08.556
How are we supposed
to find Pandy now?

53:12.026 --> 53:13.427
What is it?

53:13.460 --> 53:14.461
Oh, I have an app
that lets me know

53:14.494 --> 53:16.664
whenever a Pandy makes the news.

53:16.698 --> 53:18.800
It looks like our boy
has done it again.

53:18.833 --> 53:21.368
From high society
to street tough.

53:21.401 --> 53:23.871
Pandy and crew
raid local grocer.

53:23.905 --> 53:25.272
Oh, let me see that.

53:25.305 --> 53:26.507
He's at gone's?

53:26.541 --> 53:27.842
That's two blocks from here.

53:27.875 --> 53:28.710
Come on.

53:37.518 --> 53:39.721
I'm stuffed.

53:39.754 --> 53:40.655
Don't mention it.

53:40.688 --> 53:41.923
It's the least you can do.

53:44.025 --> 53:45.727
Stop that.

53:45.760 --> 53:48.495
I mean this is great no, but
nothing beats your heroics.

53:48.529 --> 53:49.764
It's all fake.

53:49.797 --> 53:50.832
It's a lie.

53:50.865 --> 53:52.499
Just a big fat fraud.

53:52.533 --> 53:54.702
No, you're not a fraud.

53:55.937 --> 53:57.772
Rollin says you
are kind of fat.

53:57.805 --> 54:00.641
See I know what
a real hero is.

54:00.675 --> 54:02.677
My Dad, he was a hero.

54:02.710 --> 54:03.778
He made me a star.

54:03.811 --> 54:04.712
Listen to me.

54:04.746 --> 54:07.915
There's more to big a
hero than being brave

54:07.949 --> 54:10.651
or strong or fast.

54:10.685 --> 54:15.690
A hero is someone people
look up to and my crew,

54:16.624 --> 54:18.025
we look up to you.

54:18.059 --> 54:19.527
Really?

54:19.560 --> 54:20.928
You taught me a
hero could do more

54:20.962 --> 54:24.732
with his strength than
just push people around.

54:24.766 --> 54:26.033
You could help them.

54:30.872 --> 54:31.706
Pandy.

54:33.608 --> 54:36.711
It is so good
to see you alive.

54:36.744 --> 54:37.979
[screams]

54:38.012 --> 54:39.847
Calm down, calm down.

54:39.881 --> 54:41.816
They saved my life.

54:41.849 --> 54:44.317
- They did?
- Hello.

54:45.787 --> 54:50.792
Oh, I have to tell you your
father's medallion, it's real.

54:51.826 --> 54:52.994
It's got actual magic powers.

54:53.027 --> 54:54.327
Here, go on, take it.

54:58.900 --> 55:01.869
[dramatic music]

55:13.147 --> 55:15.883
Your shops really do have
everything I'm looking for.

55:15.917 --> 55:17.084
You're the guy
from the theater?

55:17.118 --> 55:19.086
Ah, yes we meet at last.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.721
Did you think it would
end up any other way?

55:20.755 --> 55:24.491
No, I just, you look so
much larger on the big screen.

55:24.525 --> 55:26.694
What you is insolent peasant.

55:32.867 --> 55:34.569
Bruno, let me go.

55:34.602 --> 55:35.837
Sorry Pen.

55:35.870 --> 55:37.772
It's time I joined
the winning side.

55:39.406 --> 55:40.107
You fiend.

55:40.141 --> 55:42.442
Sticks and stones you hack.

55:44.545 --> 55:47.582
Looks like betrayal
is all the way around.

55:47.615 --> 55:48.850
You're a disgrace
to me, Crusher.

55:48.883 --> 55:50.985
You can't do this.

55:54.121 --> 55:55.690
You've got to stop.

55:55.723 --> 55:56.958
Crusher, you're the prince

55:56.991 --> 55:58.759
of the great Treksorian Empire.

55:58.793 --> 56:00.995
Act like it and
blow up that planet.

56:01.896 --> 56:02.997
No.

56:03.030 --> 56:04.131
Do it or you'll regret it.

56:05.032 --> 56:08.569
You taught me respect
comes with power.

56:08.603 --> 56:12.506
That those without power
don't deserve respect

56:12.540 --> 56:15.475
but we're the ones
without respect.

56:15.509 --> 56:16.978
We don't have respect.

56:17.011 --> 56:18.646
[laughs]

56:18.679 --> 56:20.781
What do you know about respect?

56:20.815 --> 56:21.949
They hate us.

56:21.983 --> 56:25.920
No one in the galactic cluster
looks up to the Treksorians.

56:25.953 --> 56:27.955
They'll have no choice
but to look up to us

56:27.989 --> 56:30.558
after we drag them
through the dirt.

56:30.591 --> 56:31.993
- Fire.
- No.

56:32.927 --> 56:35.897
[dramatic music]

56:53.648 --> 56:56.183
What have you done, you fool?

56:56.217 --> 56:59.220
I just wanted to
do what's right.

56:59.253 --> 57:00.955
You're fired on
your own people.

57:00.988 --> 57:03.524
Don't you lecture me
about what's right.

57:07.762 --> 57:08.996
Guards, lock him in his quarters

57:09.030 --> 57:10.932
until we return to Treksor.

57:13.601 --> 57:14.769
That was a warning shot.

57:14.802 --> 57:16.904
Next one won't be across
your nose but up it.

57:21.008 --> 57:22.076
A sci fax?

57:26.080 --> 57:27.480
Crusher come back.

57:27.515 --> 57:29.850
If you leave now, you
will be hereby banished.

57:31.085 --> 57:32.520
Crusher, come on.

57:32.553 --> 57:34.021
Rollins and I came
to break you out.

57:38.025 --> 57:39.093
You have alert of thing.

57:39.126 --> 57:40.728
- Dad.
- Yes, son.

57:40.761 --> 57:41.796
This the medallion.

57:41.829 --> 57:43.064
Splendid.

57:43.097 --> 57:44.732
You truly are my son.

57:48.169 --> 57:50.805
Hot potato, hot potato.

57:50.838 --> 57:53.140
Tie them up and why are
they still standing walls

57:53.174 --> 57:54.241
with explosives?

57:55.309 --> 57:56.711
Dad, come on.

57:56.744 --> 57:57.645
What are you doing?

57:58.612 --> 58:01.148
You two get to stay
and enjoy the fireworks.

58:01.182 --> 58:02.049
What?

58:02.083 --> 58:03.117
No.

58:04.251 --> 58:06.087
At least I remember
to pick up the milk.

58:09.156 --> 58:10.591
Hey, not me.

58:10.624 --> 58:12.126
You're making a mistake.

58:12.159 --> 58:14.528
Well you can't go
rewarding traitors.

58:14.562 --> 58:16.697
Their word isn't any good.

58:16.731 --> 58:17.598
Take him away.

58:23.804 --> 58:27.241
Oh man, tied up next
to a ticking time bomb.

58:27.274 --> 58:29.577
We've done this in the
show like a million times.

58:29.610 --> 58:32.213
I'm glad you
appreciate the classics.

58:32.246 --> 58:34.115
After we incinerate
the building,

58:34.148 --> 58:36.050
we'll do the same
to the whole planet.

58:36.083 --> 58:37.785
Father, please.

58:37.818 --> 58:39.186
Can't hear you traitor.

58:39.220 --> 58:41.856
Rot next to your precious hero.

58:41.889 --> 58:44.625
[dramatic music]

58:48.696 --> 58:49.897
What are you doing?

58:49.930 --> 58:52.099
Cutting through the
ropes with friction.

58:52.133 --> 58:53.667
I used it to escape
a trap like this

58:53.701 --> 58:58.639
in season one and
season two and three

58:59.306 --> 59:00.975
and I think there was four.

59:01.008 --> 59:03.177
Duke tends to reuse
certain plot devices.

59:11.619 --> 59:12.253
Oops.

59:16.891 --> 59:18.993
[blasts]

59:21.128 --> 59:23.631
Hello, anybody?

59:24.865 --> 59:25.966
Hello son.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.235
- Dad?
- Not quite.

59:28.269 --> 59:31.172
But your dad left quite an
impression on the amulet

59:31.205 --> 59:33.274
which is what's
speaking to you now.

59:33.307 --> 59:35.276
Just as his father
did before him

59:35.309 --> 59:37.344
and his grandmother and so on.

59:37.378 --> 59:38.345
What is it?

59:38.379 --> 59:40.281
This medallion
is very special.

59:40.314 --> 59:45.186
It resonates with all the energy
of Nuwa, the entire planet.

59:45.219 --> 59:47.188
- What?
- It's a conduit.

59:48.155 --> 59:50.791
If you trust your feelings
and empty your mind,

59:50.825 --> 59:53.828
you can use the medallion
to help your friends.

59:53.861 --> 59:55.896
Help save the whole planet.

59:55.930 --> 59:57.731
You've seen your own
show, haven't you?

59:57.765 --> 01:00:00.000
You mean the things
I do on the show...

01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:02.236
Are based on what the
medallion can really do.

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.938
Yes.

01:00:03.971 --> 01:00:06.340
I made sure that Duke followed
those guidelines carefully.

01:00:06.373 --> 01:00:08.008
Then I already
know what it can do.

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.944
- That's right.
- But I'm not.

01:00:09.977 --> 01:00:12.012
- I can't.
- Can't what?

01:00:12.046 --> 01:00:13.214
I'm no hero.

01:00:13.247 --> 01:00:15.382
Not like you not like Chen.

01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:19.386
Son, just because your
bravery has never been tested

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.322
doesn't mean you don't have any.

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:24.758
There was never any real need
for heroics before today.

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:28.162
You succeeded at every
challenge I set before you.

01:00:28.195 --> 01:00:30.397
Now you have a different one.

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:33.968
Are you ready to save
Nuwa and your friends?

01:00:34.001 --> 01:00:36.670
- I am.
- Then go.

01:00:36.704 --> 01:00:39.807
Use the medallion,
become the hero.

01:00:46.347 --> 01:00:51.318
Pandy are you okay?

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.686
Yeah.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:53.687
How long was I out?

01:00:53.721 --> 01:00:55.322
A couple of minutes.

01:00:55.356 --> 01:00:57.791
You sure you're okay?

01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:59.260
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:00:59.293 --> 01:01:01.428
Do you have any idea how we're
going to get out of here?

01:01:01.462 --> 01:01:02.396
Like this.

01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:06.367
- Wow.
- Let's go.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.470
We'll need a ship to
get up to father's fleet.

01:01:09.503 --> 01:01:10.704
Then let's go get one.

01:01:13.007 --> 01:01:14.241
All is clear.

01:01:14.275 --> 01:01:16.277
Let's get back before
we miss the party.

01:01:20.447 --> 01:01:21.415
What's the plan?

01:01:21.448 --> 01:01:22.816
I've got an idea.

01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:25.252
Halt, evil doers.

01:01:27.421 --> 01:01:29.957
[laughs]

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.225
Halt evil doers?

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:33.294
What, it always
worked on the show.

01:01:51.513 --> 01:01:53.981
Let's hear it for my
non idiot son Martin

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:58.819
and yours truly for leading
such a victorious crusade.

01:01:58.852 --> 01:01:59.853
[laughs]

01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:01.422
Wait, I've got a
broadcast to make.

01:02:01.455 --> 01:02:03.791
Let's turn it down a notch.

01:02:14.068 --> 01:02:17.071
People of Nuwa, let me
express my condolences

01:02:17.104 --> 01:02:19.139
for the loss of
your hero, Pandy.

01:02:19.173 --> 01:02:20.874
We'll be sending mining ships

01:02:20.908 --> 01:02:23.310
to strip your planet of
all resources starting now.

01:02:23.344 --> 01:02:26.113
When we're done, it'll
probably implode.

01:02:34.388 --> 01:02:36.890
Hey Bruno.

01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:37.592
Yeah.

01:02:37.626 --> 01:02:38.492
Listen, I'd like to apologize

01:02:38.526 --> 01:02:40.427
for casting you was a villain.

01:02:40.461 --> 01:02:41.862
Thanks.

01:02:41.895 --> 01:02:44.265
Yeah, you're more
the hitchman type.

01:02:44.298 --> 01:02:46.500
One or two episode character.

01:02:46.534 --> 01:02:48.202
Yeah, I get it.

01:02:48.235 --> 01:02:50.971
Someone who gets blown to
bits before the opening teaser.

01:02:51.005 --> 01:02:53.140
[screams]

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:58.112
Dad, I got some bad news.

01:02:58.145 --> 01:02:59.913
I despise bad news.

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:01.181
Tell it in the form of a joke.

01:03:01.215 --> 01:03:03.284
Okay, well it's
black and white

01:03:03.317 --> 01:03:04.586
and kicking your
soldiers keystrokes

01:03:04.619 --> 01:03:06.920
with a medallion of
incredible power.

01:03:06.954 --> 01:03:08.489
That's a terrible joke.

01:03:08.523 --> 01:03:10.391
- He's alive.
- Not for long.

01:03:10.424 --> 01:03:13.294
For I shall set a trap
of such insidious cunning

01:03:13.327 --> 01:03:15.462
that he will be
utterly destroyed.

01:03:18.866 --> 01:03:21.335
Seems a bit too easy.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:27.841
- Welcome, welcome.
- I'm not getting any readings

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:30.911
of fighter pilots or anything.

01:03:30.944 --> 01:03:33.280
Okay, stay close when we land.

01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:54.001
[dramatic music]

01:04:00.608 --> 01:04:02.276
Pandy, no.

01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:04.345
Good guys always fall for
the flashing arrow trap.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:09.350
If you find any pieces, save
them for my trophy room.

01:04:10.417 --> 01:04:12.119
Go ahead.

01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:13.487
Use your big boy words.

01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:15.489
They're not here.

01:04:15.523 --> 01:04:16.357
Well of course.

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.892
You obliterated them
with your blasters.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:20.961
Follow us.

01:04:20.994 --> 01:04:22.296
Did you obliterate them?

01:04:23.665 --> 01:04:25.265
Just there's no actual sign.

01:04:25.299 --> 01:04:26.500
No sign?

01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:28.570
The ship is full of
holes, they must be dead.

01:04:38.613 --> 01:04:41.315
It'll take them a while
to get through that.

01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.384
- How did...
- Remember that episode, we...

01:04:43.417 --> 01:04:47.388
It smells like we've got
much more important things

01:04:47.421 --> 01:04:50.224
to deal with right now.

01:04:50.257 --> 01:04:52.259
Where'd your father
put his prisoners?

01:04:54.696 --> 01:04:55.530
Let's go.

01:04:59.166 --> 01:05:01.268
[snores]

01:05:03.437 --> 01:05:04.972
King Karoth, is that you?

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:07.609
Your Majesty,
before you kill me,

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:09.009
you're gonna want to hear this.

01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:12.547
It's a feel good
Sitcom starring you.

01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:15.449
King Karoth knows best.

01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:20.220
I'm flexible.

01:05:20.254 --> 01:05:22.322
I take constructive
feedback very well.

01:05:22.356 --> 01:05:25.959
Writers or weaken cowardly
bunch, but this is a bit much.

01:05:25.993 --> 01:05:26.994
You're alive.

01:05:27.027 --> 01:05:29.096
I knew it, I knew it.

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:30.464
And Penny, wow.

01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:39.106
Pandy, I'm sorry.

01:05:39.139 --> 01:05:41.074
Why the heck
should we trust you?

01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:43.611
Because I know how
much I screwed up.

01:05:43.645 --> 01:05:47.448
I want to fix it, please.

01:06:14.241 --> 01:06:16.076
What's stopping you?

01:06:20.147 --> 01:06:20.748
What?

01:06:20.782 --> 01:06:21.982
The jerks family.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.661
What, what is it?

01:06:33.695 --> 01:06:35.095
I don't get it.

01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:36.698
Dad told me the
medallion can draw

01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:39.701
all the power needed from Nuwa.

01:06:39.734 --> 01:06:44.739
Pandy, you're not
on Nuwa anymore,

01:06:45.405 --> 01:06:46.173
which means you're just used up

01:06:46.206 --> 01:06:49.142
whatever charge
the thing had left.

01:06:49.176 --> 01:06:50.645
Not so fast.

01:06:50.678 --> 01:06:54.114
So kind of you to come to
the prison cells on your own.

01:06:54.147 --> 01:06:58.620
You survived, my, my that
medallion really is powerful.

01:06:58.653 --> 01:07:01.488
Hand it over or I'll
take it by force

01:07:01.523 --> 01:07:02.657
which I always enjoy.

01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:04.091
No can't do.

01:07:04.124 --> 01:07:06.326
The medallion doesn't
work away from Nuwa.

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.729
It's true father.

01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:10.163
You can't take it with you.

01:07:10.197 --> 01:07:11.633
Alright, shucks.

01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:12.634
Fire when ready.

01:07:17.639 --> 01:07:18.472
Rollins.

01:07:50.437 --> 01:07:53.808
Foolish panda, none
of you can defeat me.

01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:19.198
[dramatic music]

01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:32.546
Everyone, get through
the docking port.

01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.314
We'll escape there.

01:08:34.348 --> 01:08:35.515
Oh heavens.

01:08:35.550 --> 01:08:39.252
The damage it's
almost incalculable.

01:08:39.286 --> 01:08:40.921
The blazers with the cars.

01:08:40.955 --> 01:08:41.756
I want them back.

01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:43.691
Get them, get them now.

01:08:47.828 --> 01:08:51.599
Go, they'll need you.

01:08:51.633 --> 01:08:52.499
I can't.

01:08:52.533 --> 01:08:53.635
Just go get big ape.

01:08:55.202 --> 01:08:57.705
[dramatic music]

01:09:02.977 --> 01:09:04.845
Pandy, come on.

01:09:04.879 --> 01:09:06.948
We never would have made it
without Crusher and his crew.

01:09:06.981 --> 01:09:08.916
I can't leave them behind.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:10.216
You're not coming with us?

01:09:10.250 --> 01:09:12.386
If they don't make
it, I don't make it.

01:09:12.419 --> 01:09:16.423
This is no time
for long goodbyes.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:17.725
Come back in one piece.

01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:25.767
You made it.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:26.901
Coral is not too far behind.

01:09:26.934 --> 01:09:27.902
Come on now.

01:09:27.935 --> 01:09:30.203
Head to the last to escape port.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.509
No.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:37.277
Such is the reward
for all treasonous scum.

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:42.314
I'll take treason over
your stinking empire any day.

01:09:43.785 --> 01:09:45.218
Do you really think you
and your crew can escape?

01:09:45.252 --> 01:09:47.988
I destroyed your last
hope of fleeing this ship.

01:09:48.022 --> 01:09:51.224
That may be true, but
all this destruction

01:09:51.258 --> 01:09:53.694
looks awfully expensive.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:58.365
I'm afraid your
son is correct.

01:09:58.398 --> 01:10:02.302
Say hi to grandma for me.

01:10:02.335 --> 01:10:04.939
Our financial losses were
sent directly to your mother

01:10:04.972 --> 01:10:07.307
and she's calling us home.

01:10:12.046 --> 01:10:15.917
And you thought it
was all just a TV show.

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:17.350
I have been wrong before.

01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:19.854
[laughs]

01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:21.923
Your old man looked really mad.

01:10:21.956 --> 01:10:23.958
Oh, you think he's mad?

01:10:23.991 --> 01:10:25.593
You should see his mom.

01:10:25.626 --> 01:10:27.762
I think it'll just let
Karoth see her for me.

01:10:27.795 --> 01:10:30.631
The only thing I'm
seeing to is your demise.

01:10:36.037 --> 01:10:37.404
You'd think I'd
let you escape?

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:39.507
I'm not Karoth the runaway.

01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.776
I'm not Karoth the bankrupt.

01:10:41.809 --> 01:10:43.678
I'm Karoth the destroyer.

01:10:47.782 --> 01:10:48.716
[laughs]

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:49.684
What's wrong?

01:10:49.717 --> 01:10:51.485
You were so snide a second ago.

01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:52.954
We need to do something.

01:10:54.321 --> 01:10:54.922
Like what?

01:11:05.833 --> 01:11:07.334
Help me.

01:11:07.367 --> 01:11:08.368
We need to get closer to Nuwa.

01:11:08.401 --> 01:11:09.737
Why would that?

01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:31.526
It's over.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:41.536
[blasts]

01:11:46.007 --> 01:11:46.808

[dramatic music]

01:11:58.085 --> 01:11:58.986
We're saved.

01:12:04.457 --> 01:12:05.693
What are you doing Pandy?

01:12:05.726 --> 01:12:07.427
You guys get to safety.

01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:13.400
You aren't getting away.

01:12:29.016 --> 01:12:31.018
Is everyone okay?

01:12:31.052 --> 01:12:33.821
[dramatic music]

01:13:51.899 --> 01:13:54.035
- You're on the air Penny.
- Thanks Bruno.

01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:57.004
Everyone please listen.

01:13:57.038 --> 01:13:58.673
Right now our hero Pandy

01:13:58.706 --> 01:14:00.808
is fighting against
the king of the aliens

01:14:00.841 --> 01:14:02.643
that attacked our planet.

01:14:02.677 --> 01:14:04.679
Their king is strong
and merciless,

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.048
but Pandy is fearlessly
taking him on.

01:14:07.081 --> 01:14:09.684
For Nuwa, believe in him.

01:14:09.717 --> 01:14:11.585
Please cheer him on.

01:14:11.619 --> 01:14:14.555
Make these aliens learn
the power of Nuwa.

01:14:20.928 --> 01:14:21.762
What?

01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:26.000
[upbeat music]

01:15:14.682 --> 01:15:17.818
No, I'll get you
next time Pandy.

01:15:57.725 --> 01:15:59.794
[applause]

01:16:02.863 --> 01:16:05.766
Hey guys, get over here.

01:16:06.434 --> 01:16:07.935
I don't think that's such a...

01:16:07.968 --> 01:16:10.771
You're all part
of the family now.

01:16:17.011 --> 01:16:18.746
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

01:16:18.779 --> 01:16:20.081
Way ahead of you Penny.

01:16:22.683 --> 01:16:24.819
This might be our
last adventure together,

01:16:24.852 --> 01:16:27.154
but who knew you'd finally
join the forces of good?

01:16:27.188 --> 01:16:28.756
Last adventure?

01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:30.291
We'll get out of this together.

01:16:30.324 --> 01:16:33.160
You really think
you can escape me?

01:16:33.194 --> 01:16:34.795
Lord of the galaxy?

01:16:35.696 --> 01:16:38.866
[laughs hysterically]

01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:43.270
I'm so sorry.

01:16:44.939 --> 01:16:45.739
I don't know something got.

01:16:45.773 --> 01:16:46.740
Are you kidding?

01:16:46.774 --> 01:16:49.043
- That was great.
- Absolutely.

01:16:49.076 --> 01:16:50.845
In all my days at Nada,

01:16:50.878 --> 01:16:53.781
I've never seen him
maniacal laugh like that.

01:16:53.814 --> 01:16:54.715
Thanks.

01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:57.885
You know, like father like son.

01:16:57.918 --> 01:17:00.921
Well let's hope you're
not too much like him.

01:17:00.955 --> 01:17:02.823
[laughs]

01:17:02.857 --> 01:17:04.291
That's a wrap for the day.

01:17:04.325 --> 01:17:05.259
Let's go home.

01:17:10.097 --> 01:17:12.433
Hey, I still owe you one

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:15.069
for making me a
hero this season.

01:17:15.102 --> 01:17:17.905
I was thinking us
guys could head out

01:17:17.938 --> 01:17:19.106
for a bite to eat.

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.674
A little bonding time.

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:22.910
It could be good for the show.
