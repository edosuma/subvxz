[COUNTRY WESTERN MUSIC PLAYING]

00:16.210 --> 00:19.077
YOU MAY THINK
THAT DOING HOT YOGA
AFTER A SPIN CLASS

00:19.120 --> 00:21.441
IS A GOOD IDEA,
BUT TRUST ME, IT IS NOT.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.345
I MUST BE INSANE.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.346
WHEW.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.483
I'M BEN FRANKLIN.

00:27.520 --> 00:31.422
YOUR SPONSOR HAS TOLD ME
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

00:31.460 --> 00:33.451
WAIT. YOU'RE BEN FRANKLIN.

00:33.500 --> 00:35.821
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE
HOW WE CAN BE

00:35.860 --> 00:38.522
ANYONE WE WANT ONLINE?

00:38.570 --> 00:40.390
MM.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.829
ANYWAY, YOUR SPONSOR
ASKED ME TO CHECK ON YOU

00:42.870 --> 00:46.078
BECAUSE HE, WELL, NOW WE

00:46.110 --> 00:49.079
ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR HEALTH.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.771
OK.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.710
NO, HONEY, IT'S NOT OK.

00:52.750 --> 00:53.842
LOOK AT YOU.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.212
YOU LOOK SUPER STRESSED
TO ME.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.740
ARE YOU STRESSED?

00:57.790 --> 00:59.519
MAYBE A LITTLE.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.084
THE PROBLEM IS,

01:01.120 --> 01:04.453
YOU NEED TO BE
A BETTER MANAGER.

01:04.490 --> 01:07.220
I'M TRYING.

01:07.260 --> 01:11.594
YOU'VE ONLY RECRUITED
3 MEMBERS IN 2 MONTHS.

01:11.630 --> 01:14.428
NOW, 5 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER.

01:14.470 --> 01:17.507
WHEN YOUR 5 PEOPLE
EACH RECRUIT 5 MORE,

01:17.540 --> 01:19.679
WELL, THEN YOU CAN
KICK BACK AND RELAX.

01:19.710 --> 01:21.530
I KNOW. I'LL GET THERE.

01:21.580 --> 01:23.377
WHEN?

01:23.410 --> 01:24.877
NEXT WEEK?

01:24.910 --> 01:26.548
NEXT MONTH?

01:26.580 --> 01:30.186
DON'T JEOPARDIZE YOUR HEALTH.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:32.490 --> 01:34.151
NOW GO GET 'EM.

01:34.190 --> 01:36.556
FINE.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.893
HI, GEORGE.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.465
YEAH, I TALKED TO HER.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.870
ARE YOU SURE?

01:53.910 --> 01:56.208
UH-HUH.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.649
OK.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.571
YEAH. I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.160
AGENT HOTCHNER.

02:25.510 --> 02:27.535
MR. AXELROD WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.142
PLEASE.

02:53.870 --> 02:55.633
[BUZZER]

03:05.410 --> 03:06.547

03:06.580 --> 03:08.639
THANK YOU, DIRECTOR COCHRAN.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.648
AXELROD: HELLO, HOTCH.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.351
YOU COULDN'T JUST CALL?

03:12.390 --> 03:13.652
I COULD HAVE.
WE'D STILL HAVE TO MEET.

03:13.690 --> 03:15.248
FIGURED I'D CUT OUT A STEP.

03:15.290 --> 03:20.398
PLUS, THIS IS MORE
COMFORTABLE
THAN A PARKING GARAGE.

03:20.430 --> 03:21.988
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

03:22.030 --> 03:26.535
A JOINT NSA-DEA
INVESTIGATION INTO LIBERTAD,

03:26.570 --> 03:28.231
THE ONLINE ILLICIT DRUG SITE,

03:28.270 --> 03:30.409
HAS GONE SOUTH FAST.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.271
I HEARD ABOUT IT.

03:32.310 --> 03:35.575
YEAH, WELL, ONE DEA
UNDERCOVER AGENT'S NOW DEAD,

03:35.610 --> 03:36.872
TWO ARE MISSING.

03:36.910 --> 03:38.605
SOMEONE IN THE CARTEL
MADE THEM.

03:38.650 --> 03:39.969
IT WOULD APPEAR SO.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.284
I'D LIKE YOUR TEAM
TO INVESTIGATE.

03:42.320 --> 03:46.586
WHY US? SURELY
THE DEA'S GOT LEADS.

03:46.620 --> 03:48.918
TRUE. YOU AND YOUR TEAM
ARE BETTER.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.618
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?

03:54.060 --> 03:57.791
LOOK, SOMEONE GAVE UP
THOSE AGENTS.

03:57.830 --> 03:59.536
I HAVE GOOD REASON
TO BELIEVE IT WAS

03:59.570 --> 04:02.038
THE ASSISTANT DEA DIRECTOR
IN CHARGE OF THE OPERATION,

04:02.070 --> 04:04.538
BERNARD GRAFF.

04:04.570 --> 04:06.629
I NEED YOU
TO GET THE PROOF.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.569
WHY NOT GO TO THE
OFFICE OF PROFESSIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY?

04:09.610 --> 04:10.702
IT'LL RAISE SOME FLAGS.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.810
GRAFF WOULD SUSPECT
AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS
INVESTIGATION.

04:13.850 --> 04:17.411
YOU'RE ALREADY INVOLVED
IN THE DARKNET WITH
GIUSEPPE MONTOLO,

04:17.450 --> 04:19.315
SO YOU HAVE
THE PERFECT COVER.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.055
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
IT'S GRAFF?

04:21.090 --> 04:23.752
HE KNOWS TECHNICAL DETAILS
BEYOND THE SCOPE OF HIS JOB.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.623
AND THERE'S A FLASH DRIVE
THAT NEVER LEAVES HIS WRIST.

04:26.660 --> 04:30.926
I THINK IT HAS THE ACCESS CODE
TO THE LIBERTAD SERVERS.

04:32.370 --> 04:35.294
I DID YOU A FAVOR ONCE.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.661
CONSIDER THIS REPAYMENT.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.731
A MOLE HUNT
IS ILL-ADVISED FOR THOSE

04:41.780 --> 04:44.749
WHO DON'T WANT TO RISK
THEIR OWN SKINS.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.543
IT'S AN OLD PROVERB
I JUST MADE UP.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.445
AXELROD ASKED FOR MY HELP.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.584
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
YOU NEED TO START
WITH A PROFILE.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.554
NOW, WHY WOULD
A HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIAL

04:52.590 --> 04:54.911
BE INVOLVED WITH A SECRET
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.757
LURE OF EASY MONEY.

04:56.790 --> 04:59.725
BOREDOM. THINKING
HE'S SMARTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.990
FANTASY OF LIVING
A DIFFERENT LIFE.

05:02.030 --> 05:05.329
I ASSUME YOU WANT TO
KEEP THIS BETWEEN US
FOR NOW?

05:05.370 --> 05:06.598
YEAH.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.631
GARCIA, ARE YOU READY?

05:08.670 --> 05:09.659
UH, HOLD ON, PLEASE.

05:13.680 --> 05:14.772
YES.

05:14.810 --> 05:17.108
SEE, THE BLUE
PLAYS OFF THE SWEATER.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.812
IT'S COMPLEMENTARY,
BUT IT'S NOT MATCHY-MATCHY.

05:19.850 --> 05:22.614
YOU'VE BEEN HERE A WEEK.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
UNPACKING?

05:22.650 --> 05:24.686
IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS
A BIT EASIER.

05:24.720 --> 05:27.757
I TOOK MY HOTPLATE OUT
'CAUSE I WAS SICK OF
THE CAFETERIA FOOD,

05:27.790 --> 05:28.711
BUT I'M NOT GOING
TO BE HERE MUCH LONGER

05:28.760 --> 05:30.421
'CAUSE OF THIS
NEW CASE, HUH?

05:30.460 --> 05:31.882
YOU GUYS ARE GOING INTO
THE BELLY OF THE BEAST.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.898
YOU'RE GONNA FIND OUT
WHO'S TARGETING ME.
AM I RIGHT?

05:33.930 --> 05:35.795
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

05:35.830 --> 05:37.718
THE DARKNET--THAT'S WHERE
ALL MONTOLO'S CRONIES LIVE.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.490
IF ANYONE CAN FIND
THE ANSWER, SIR, IT'S
YOU GUYS. I KNOW YOU CAN.

05:42.710 --> 05:45.463
THE NSA AND THE DEA
ARE BOTH INVOLVED,

05:45.510 --> 05:46.909
SO WE'LL BE PART
OF A JOINT TASKFORCE.

05:46.940 --> 05:47.907
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

05:47.940 --> 05:49.441
OK. UH, 3 WEEKS AGO

05:49.480 --> 05:52.643
UNDERCOVER DEA AGENT
MARK BOWERS DISAPPEARED.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.443
HE WAS BASED IN EL PASO,

05:54.480 --> 05:57.643
BUT 5 DAYS AGO
HIS BODY SHOWED UP
IN CIUDAD JUAREZ,

05:57.690 --> 05:59.681
JUST ACROSS THE MEXICAN BORDER.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.450
CIUDAD JUAREZ IS ONE OF
THE MOST DANGEROUS
CITIES IN THE WORLD.

06:02.490 --> 06:04.378
NOT ONLY WAS AGENT BOWERS
FOUND STRANGLED,

06:04.430 --> 06:08.799
BUT HE ALSO HAD
ANOTHER HUMAN FACE
COVERING HIS OWN FACE.

06:08.830 --> 06:10.923
ANOTHER HUMAN FACE?

06:10.970 --> 06:12.938
YES. I GUESS SKINNED
OR SCALPED.

06:12.970 --> 06:15.768
I DON'T NOW WHAT
YOU CALL IT, BUT I COULDN'T
PUT THE PICTURES UP HERE.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.062
YOU CAN SEE THEM
ON YOUR OWN TABLETS.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.931
IT IS TYPICAL FOR DRUG
CARTELS TO USE A CORPSE
TO SEND A MESSAGE.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.629
YEAH, BODY PARTS
SENT TO FAMILY MEMBERS.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.477
A FACE ON TOP
OF ANOTHER FACE

06:23.510 --> 06:26.001
COULD EASILY MEAN
HE'S UNDERCOVER
OR HE'S TWO-FACED.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.018
WHICH IS BAD NEWS
FOR THE TWO MISSING AGENTS.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.540
THEY WERE BOTH UNDERCOVER.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.717
YEAH, JOHN PORTMAN
VANISHED A WEEK AGO.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.116
AND THEN SARAH MILES
DISAPPEARED YESTERDAY.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.425
ALL OF THESE AGENTS
WERE INVESTIGATING
THE LIBERTAD DRUG CARTEL.

06:37.460 --> 06:38.950
WELL, IF SOMEONE
KNEW THAT THEY WERE
UNDERCOVER,

06:38.990 --> 06:40.890
THEN THERE HAS TO BE
A MOLE ON THE INSIDE.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.727
WELL, WE HAVE TO CONSIDER
ALL POSSIBILITIES.

06:42.770 --> 06:45.125
THIS CARTEL IS IN FACT
UNIQUE IN A FEW WAYS.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.889
YEAH, IT APPEARED
ON THE DARKNET AFTER
THE SILK ROAD WAS SHUT DOWN.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.137
IT HAS AN ONLINE AND
AN ON-THE-GROUND COMPONENT

06:51.170 --> 06:53.809
BASED IN EL PASO.
IT'S RUN BY SOMEONE
NAMED GEORGE WASHINGTON.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.479
AN IDENTITY THAT
CAN BE ASSUMED BY
DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.603
EL PASO'S JUST ACROSS
THE RIO GRANDE

06:58.650 --> 07:00.447
FROM SOME OF THE WORST
DRUG VIOLENCE THERE IS.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.141
NOT A BAD PLACE TO SET UP.

07:02.180 --> 07:03.841
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.141
I MEAN, IT'D BE SO EASY
TO FLY UNDER THE RADAR

07:05.190 --> 07:07.181
WHEN THERE'S BIGGER FISH
TO FRY RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.778
ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL
ALL HEAD TO EL PASO

07:08.820 --> 07:10.685
AND FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE MISSING AGENTS.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.994
I WILL RUN THE CYBER PART
OF THE INVESTIGATION
FROM HERE.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.588
HAPPY HUNTING.

[GROANS]

07:24.940 --> 07:26.874
OH, GOD.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.174
WHAT HAPPENED?

07:29.210 --> 07:31.144
DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE?

07:33.280 --> 07:37.489
[DOOR OPENS]

07:39.990 --> 07:42.720
SARAH: WHO ARE YOU?

07:42.760 --> 07:45.752
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?

07:45.790 --> 07:48.554
WHY ARE WE HERE?

08:44.890 --> 08:46.710
HotCh: "THE ENEMY
IS WITHIN THE GATES.

08:46.760 --> 08:49.012
"IT IS WITH OUR OWN LUXURY,
OUR OWN FOLLY,

08:49.060 --> 08:52.086
OUR OWN CRIMINALITY
THAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND."

MARCUS TULLIUS CICERO.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.624
SARAH MILES, ONE OF
THE MISSING DEA AGENTS,

08:56.670 --> 08:58.968
HAS TWO YOUNG CHILDREN,
AGE 3 AND 5.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.934
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT KIND OF SACRIFICES

09:00.970 --> 09:02.289
SHE HAD TO MAKE
TO GO UNDERCOVER.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.729
WE ALL DO
WHAT WE HAVE TO.

09:04.770 --> 09:07.603
SHE MAY HAVE THOUGHT
THE LIBERTAD ASSIGNMENT

09:07.640 --> 09:09.176
WASN'T AS DANGEROUS
AS INFILTRATING

09:09.210 --> 09:11.576
ONE OF THE BIGGER
MEXICAN SYNDICATES.

09:11.610 --> 09:14.078
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
MARK BOWERS,
THE DEAD DEA AGENT,

09:14.120 --> 09:17.317
HIS BODY WAS FOUND
50 YARDS AWAY
FROM A MASS GRAVE

09:17.350 --> 09:19.853
FILLED WITH ENEMIES
OF THE SINALOA CARTEL.

09:19.890 --> 09:22.211
SO WAS DISPOSING
HIS BODY THERE

09:22.260 --> 09:23.750
A FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE

09:23.790 --> 09:25.655
TO THROW SUSPICION
ON A DIFFERENT GROUP?

09:25.690 --> 09:27.226
IT COULD BE. THE AREA'S
BEEN A BATTLEGROUND

09:27.260 --> 09:29.592
FOR THE JUAREZ, GULF,
AND SINALOA CARTELS.

09:29.630 --> 09:31.996
PLUS A LOT OF SMALLER
GANGS AND SPLINTER
GROUPS ARE FORMED,

09:32.030 --> 09:33.691
ALL WITH SHIFI'ING ALLIANCES.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.890
YEAH, BUT WHY?
WHY LAUNCH
A GROUND OPERATION?

09:35.940 --> 09:38.101
I MEAN, ISN'T AN ONLINE
PLATFORM ENOUGH?

09:38.140 --> 09:40.904
GREED AND HUBRIS.
GOTI'A THINK LIKE A DRUG LORD.

09:40.940 --> 09:43.909
WHY HAVE ONE WHEN
YOU CAN HAVE BOTH?

09:53.860 --> 09:54.918
YOU MUST BE AGENT HOTCHNER.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.086
YES, SIR.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.951
I'M ASSISTANT DEA DIRECTOR
BERNARD GRAFF.

09:57.990 --> 10:00.356
WELCOME TO THE CYBER WAR
AGAINST DRUGS.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.027
WE COULD ALWAYS USE
THE EXTRA HELP,

10:02.060 --> 10:04.790
BUT I'M SURPRISED
THE NSA PULLED YOU
INTO THIS.

10:04.830 --> 10:06.263
AREN'T YOU BUSY
HUNTING PSYCHOPATHS

10:06.300 --> 10:07.961
WHO CUT UP PROSTITUTES
OR SOMETHING?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.662
WELL, WE HAVE A CASE
AND THERE MAY BE
SOME CROSS-OVER.

10:10.710 --> 10:13.873
YOU MEAN GIUSEPPE MONTOLO
AND THE ONLINE HIT MEN.

10:13.910 --> 10:16.799
YES. WE'RE INTERESTED
IN WHOEVER THE SUCCESSOR
TO THE SILK ROAD MAY BE,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.670
AND LIBERTAD SEEMS
TO FIT THE BILL.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.109
WELL, IF YOU ASK ME,
THE NSA'S GOT IT EASY.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.970
ALL THEY DO IS MONITOR
AND ANALYZE.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.817
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO PUTTING AWAY
THE BAD GUYS,

10:23.850 --> 10:26.216
YOU AND I HAVE TO DO
ALL THE DIRTY WORK.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

10:26.250 --> 10:27.285
NO, NO.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.981
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IT'S NOT RELATED.

10:29.020 --> 10:31.386
MY BEST FRIEND DID NOT
JUST HAVE A HIKING ACCIDENT.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.658
I'M OUT OF HERE.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.951
SIMON.

10:34.000 --> 10:37.766
WELL, HE SEEMED UPSET.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.960
THIS IS ADRIENNE MITCHELL,

10:39.000 --> 10:40.297
OUR HEAD LIBERTAD
INTELLIGENCE SPECIALIST.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.659
AGENT HOTCHNER'S FROM THE BAU.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.962
NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.002
THE MAN WHO JUST LEI-T
WAS OUR CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANT SIMON KAHN.

10:46.040 --> 10:47.075
HE JUST LEARNED
HIS FRIEND DIED.

10:47.110 --> 10:49.670
I'LL GIVE HIM SOME SPACE,
THEN WE TALK TO HIM AGAIN.

10:49.710 --> 10:53.043
GRAFF: OUR SPECIALISTS
HAVE BEEN POSING ONLINE
AS BUYERS AND DEALERS.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.071
WE MADE CONTACT WITH SIMON
5 MONTHS AGO,

10:55.120 --> 10:57.441
WHO ALERTED US TO THE
HYBRID NATURE OF LIBERTAD.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.856
HE'S A TOR NETWORK
RELAY OPERATOR FOR THEM.

10:59.890 --> 11:02.017
HE WANTS OUT BUT
CLAIMS HE'S NOT BEING
ALLOWED TO QUIT.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.687
IS HE BEING THREATENED?

11:03.730 --> 11:05.425
APPARENTLY, BUT WE HAVEN'T
SEEN THE EVIDENCE.

11:05.460 --> 11:07.758
DOES HE KNOW WHO
THE HEAD OF THE CARTEL IS?

11:07.800 --> 11:10.064
THE REAL I.D.
OF GEORGE WASHINGTON?

11:10.100 --> 11:12.898
NO. BUT HE DOES KNOW
THE NUMBER TWO.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.033
IT TOOK MONTHS
TO GET HIM TO COME IN.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.162
HE WAS CLOSE
TO GIVING US A NAME,

11:16.200 --> 11:17.929
BUT NOW HE'S SCARED AGAIN.

11:17.970 --> 11:20.939
I'D LIKE TO GET
MY OWN ANALYST ON THIS,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.072
SHE'LL WORK OUT OF THE BAU.

11:22.110 --> 11:23.304
BY ALL MEANS.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.147
JAKE, WOULD YOU MIND
SHOWING AGENT HOTCHNER

11:25.180 --> 11:26.909
JAKE: YES, SIR.
WHERE HE CAN SET UP, PLEASE.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.269
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

11:32.220 --> 11:37.180
WE NEED TO FIND OUT
WHY HE'S REALLY HERE.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.951
THEY WERE ALL POSING
AS BUYERS.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.219
AGENT BOWERS HAD BEEN
UNDERCOVER THE LONGEST
AT 4 MONTHS.

11:45.270 --> 11:48.034
PORTMAN WENT UNDERCOVER
3 MONTHS AGO.

11:48.070 --> 11:49.958
SARAH MILES, 10 WEEKS AGO.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.238
ANY OF THEM
MAKE CONTACT YET?

11:51.270 --> 11:52.976
WE HEARD FROM BOWERS TWICE,

11:53.010 --> 11:55.205
ONCE FROM PORTMAN
TWO DAYS BEFORE HE VANISHED.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.401
THERE'S BEEN NO DIRECT
CONTACT FROM SARAH.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.042
SO HOW DID YOU KNOW
THEY WERE MISSING?

11:59.080 --> 12:01.469
THEY LET US KNOW THEY'RE OK
VIA DEAD DROP,

12:01.520 --> 12:05.741
LEAVING A CHALK MARK
AT A DESIGNATED LOCATION
EVERY 3 DAYS.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.314
ALL OF THEM MISSED
THEIR CHECK-INS.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.055
OK, NOW, YOU SAID
YOU HAD CONTACT WITH
TWO OF THE AGENTS.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.751
YES, VERY BRIEFLY.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.929
BUT THEY PASSED ALONG
USEFUL INFORMATION.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.929
IT SEEMS THE GROUND CREW
OF THE LIBERTAD CARTEL

12:15.960 --> 12:18.360
ARE ALL CUSTOMERS
WHO GET A CUT OF THE PROFITS

12:18.400 --> 12:20.231
IF THEY RECRUIT
MORE CUSTOMERS.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.465
PYRAMID SCHEME.
THAT'S INNOVATIVE.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.139
WE'VE I.D.'d SOME OF
THE LOWER LEVEL MEMBERS,

12:25.170 --> 12:28.105
BUT WHO WE REALLY
NEED TO GET TO IS BEN FRANKLIN.

12:28.140 --> 12:31.371
THIS INDIVIDUAL IS THE NEXUS
BETWEEN THE GROUND OPERATION
AND THE INTERNET.

12:31.410 --> 12:33.878
WE THINK BOWERS MADE
CONTACT WITH THAT PERSON,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.343
BUT HE WAS KILLED
BEFORE WE COULD FOLLOW UP.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.144
HAVE YOU CHECKED IN
WITH THEIR FAMILIES?
ANY OF THEM MADE CONTACT?

12:39.190 --> 12:41.112
FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK.
SARAH MILES' HUSBAND

12:41.160 --> 12:45.119
THERE WAS A HANG-UP CALL
FROM A NUMBER HE DIDN'T
RECOGNIZE 3 DAYS AGO.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.526
IT WAS THE ANNIVERSARY OF
HIS AND SARAH'S FIRST DATE.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.959
DID YOU TRACE THE CALL?

12:49.000 --> 12:52.128
IT CAME FROM A BAR
JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN.

12:52.170 --> 12:55.037
IF IT WAS SARAH,
IT WOULD BE A VIOLATION
OF PROTOCOL.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.332
CHANCES ARE
IT WAS A WRONG NUMBER.

12:56.370 --> 12:57.530
OR NOT.

13:02.180 --> 13:03.044
JOHN?

13:03.080 --> 13:06.345
DON'T GIVE UP.
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

13:06.380 --> 13:11.147
THINK OF YOUR FAMILY.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.145
TESSA.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.818
AND THE BOYS.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.589
THEY LOVE YOU.

13:16.620 --> 13:19.225
THE BOYS...

13:22.330 --> 13:24.867
WE'RE STILL WAITING
ON THE DNA RESULTS.

13:24.900 --> 13:28.290
I CAN TELL YOU THAT
WHOEVER DID THIS
TOOK HIS TIME

13:28.340 --> 13:30.467
IN CAREFULLY CU'ITING
OFF THE FACE.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.569
SO THE UNSUB
HAD SPECIAL SKILLS.

13:32.610 --> 13:35.033
I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.902
BUT TO DISSECT THE FASCIA
AND REFLECT THE
MUSCULATURE OFF THE FACE

13:38.950 --> 13:40.349
TAKES TIME AND PATIENCE.

13:40.380 --> 13:43.986
AND THIS FACE WAS PLACED
ON TOP OF MARK BOWERS.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.339
A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAN THAT.

13:45.390 --> 13:48.211
THE C.O.D. WAS MANUAL
STRANGULATION.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.887
NOTHING UNUSUAL THERE.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.522
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

13:57.030 --> 13:58.224
HMM.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.568
THIS COULD BE A CASE
OF STIGMATAPHILIA,

14:00.600 --> 14:04.366
SEXUAL AROUSAL FROM
TA'ITOOS OR BODY PIERCINGS.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.628
PERHAPS, BUT IT'S
ALSO FUNCTIONAL.

14:06.670 --> 14:10.174
IN ORDER TO SECURE
THE SKINNED FACE
ON TOP OF THIS ONE,

14:10.210 --> 14:12.644
THE KILLER NEEDED
TO FIND A WAY TO A'ITACH IT.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.011
WAS THIS DONE
POSTMORTEM?

14:14.050 --> 14:15.210
YES.

14:15.250 --> 14:16.069
THAT MEANS THE UNSUB

14:16.120 --> 14:17.485
SPENT A LOT OF TIME
WITH THE DEAD BODY.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.284
NOT THE TYPICAL M.O.
OF A DRUG CARTEL KILLER.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.208
THIS FEELS LIKE THE UNSUB
IS GE'ITING OFF SOMEHOW

14:22.260 --> 14:24.125
IN TAKING THE TIME
TO SAVOR HIS KILL.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.185
AND WE KNOW HE LIKES
THE WET WORK.

14:37.340 --> 14:42.539
HI. UH, WE'RE AGENTS
JAREAU AND LEWIS WITH THE FBI.

14:42.580 --> 14:44.969
WE'RE WONDERING, HAVE YOU--
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS WOMAN?

14:45.010 --> 14:47.319
SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE
ABOUT 3 DAYS AGO.

14:47.350 --> 14:48.339
NO.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.348
ARE YOU SURE?

14:50.390 --> 14:52.278
SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IN HERE WITH
SOMEBODY ELSE.

14:55.390 --> 14:58.257
WELL, SHE'S MISSING,
SO ANY INFORMATION
YOU CAN GIVE US

14:58.290 --> 15:00.099
WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

15:00.130 --> 15:03.065
SORRY.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.126
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.138
OH, I'M SORRY.
ONE OTHER THING.

15:08.170 --> 15:10.035
WHO'S THE GENERAL
MANAGER HERE?

15:10.070 --> 15:11.662
IAM.

15:11.710 --> 15:14.599
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP

15:14.640 --> 15:16.608
THAT SOMEBODY WAS
SKIMMING OFF THE RECEIPTS,

15:16.640 --> 15:20.315
SO WE'RE JUST GONNA NEED
TO TAKE A QUICK LOOK
AT YOUR BOOKS.

15:20.350 --> 15:22.079
H-HOLD ON.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.247
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE INTERESTED
IN A MISSING PERSON.

15:24.290 --> 15:27.282
WE ARE. BUT THE FBI
ALSO HANDLES FEDERAL
TAX VIOLATIONS.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.118
I MEAN, YOU HAVE BOOKS,
RIGHT?

15:30.160 --> 15:31.252
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T
HAVE BOOKS,

15:31.290 --> 15:33.429
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.394
CAN I SEE
THAT PHOTO AGAIN?

15:35.430 --> 15:37.159
OH.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.599
THIS ONE?

15:38.630 --> 15:41.337
OK. YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:41.370 --> 15:43.133
I THINK I REMEMBER HER NOW.

15:43.170 --> 15:46.367
YEAH, I--SHE WASN'T
IN HERE VERY LONG.

15:46.410 --> 15:50.540
SHE WAS TALKING
TO A, UH, SOCCER MOM.

15:50.580 --> 15:51.979
SOCCER MOM?

15:52.010 --> 15:52.977
YEAH.

15:53.020 --> 15:56.217
SHE WAS CUTE, LIKE YOU.

16:02.660 --> 16:04.389
OH. THANKS.

16:04.430 --> 16:07.092
AXELROD SAID YOU WERE
A REAL STRAIGHT ARROW.

16:07.130 --> 16:09.553
LIKE ELIOT NESS REBORN.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.465
IS THAT YOUR DAD?

16:11.500 --> 16:12.660
YEAH.

16:12.700 --> 16:15.362
THAT'S MY DAD.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.166
HE WAS IN THE DEA, TOO.

16:19.210 --> 16:21.428
HIS FATHER, MY GRANDPA,
WAS A G-MAN.

16:23.380 --> 16:24.699
IT MAKES YOU ALL WONDER,
DOESN'T IT?

16:24.750 --> 16:26.047
ABOUT WHAT?

16:26.080 --> 16:29.015
IF WHAT WE'RE DOING
REALLY MA'ITERS.

16:29.050 --> 16:31.348
IN THE END, WE'RE ALL
JUST GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES,
AREN'T WE?

16:31.390 --> 16:33.711
AI-TER WE'RE GONE,
SOMEONE WILL TAKE OUR PLACE.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.512
NEW CRIMINALS REPLACE THE OLD.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.348
MAKE YOU WANT
TO GIVE IT ALL UP
FOR A DIFFERENT LIFE?

16:41.360 --> 16:44.488
I KNOW WHY YOU'RE REALLY HERE.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.537
HORNET.

16:51.370 --> 16:53.304
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T AWARE

16:53.340 --> 16:55.205
THERE ARE MULTIPLE
DARKNETS.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.379
TOR NETWORK
IS JUST ONE OF THEM.

16:57.410 --> 16:59.401
THERE ARE OVER TWO MILLION
USERS ON TOR,

16:59.450 --> 17:01.509
WHICH IS SLOWING IT DOWN,
MAKING IT TOO VULNERABLE.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.347
A LOT OF OPERATIONS
ARE JUMPING SHIP

17:03.390 --> 17:05.346
TO OTHER DARKNETS,
LIKE HORNET.

17:05.390 --> 17:07.654
YOU THINK LIBERTAD WILL?

17:07.690 --> 17:10.818
PROBABLY.

17:10.860 --> 17:13.624
BUT I BET GIUSEPPE MONTOLO'S
HIT MEN HAVE ALREADY MOVED.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.792
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE YOU THINK
WE HAVE UNDERCOVER ACCESS
TO A HORNET ROUTER.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.795
DO YOU?

17:22.840 --> 17:25.559
NO. WE'RE STILL
WORKING ON IT.

17:25.610 --> 17:27.532
SO YOUR PRESENCE HERE
IS PREMATURE.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.535
[CELL PHONE VIBRATES]

17:28.580 --> 17:30.605
EXCUSE ME.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.572
YEAH, DAVE.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.138
YEAH, KEEP ME POSTED.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.841
THAN KS.

17:36.880 --> 17:38.381
MY TEAM HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE

17:38.420 --> 17:40.752
OF A SERIAL KILLER
WORKING IN THE EL PASO AREA

17:40.790 --> 17:42.485
USING THE DRUG VIOLENCE
AS A COVER.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.751
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU'RE ON THIS CASE,
THEN, ISN'T IT?

17:54.500 --> 17:56.695
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH US?

18:04.580 --> 18:06.104
YOU LEAVE HER ALONE.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.214
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH HIM?

18:19.190 --> 18:21.499
[GROANING]

18:23.630 --> 18:26.190
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING--

18:26.230 --> 18:27.731
ANSWER ME!

18:27.770 --> 18:29.431
JOHN!

18:29.470 --> 18:30.459
OH, NO!

18:50.560 --> 18:54.348
IT'S, UH,
AGENT JOHN PORTMAN.

18:55.630 --> 18:59.225
HIS FACE IS, UH, MISSING.

18:59.270 --> 19:00.464
I'M SORRY.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.660
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.635
THE CORONER SAID
HE WAS IN BAD SHAPE.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.763
HE WAS SEVERELY
DEHYDRATED

19:06.810 --> 19:08.505
AND HAD EVIDENCE
OF ELECTRICAL BURNS.

19:08.540 --> 19:11.373
SO HE WAS HELD
AND POSSIBLY TORTURED.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.571
ANY SIGNIFICANCE
TO THIS AREA?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.770
YOU MEAN LIKE
A MASS GRAVE NEARBY?

19:15.820 --> 19:16.775
NO.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.788
AGENT LOPEZ?

19:19.990 --> 19:22.788
EXCUSE ME.

19:22.820 --> 19:26.187
THAT MEANS THE UNSUB'S
GIVEN UP ON A FORENSIC
COUNTERMEASURE.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.652
IT COULD BE BORDER
CONTROL'S TIGHTER,

19:27.700 --> 19:31.329
OR HE'S JUST GE'ITING
MORE BOLD AND CARELESS.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.430
ONE VICTIM WAS FOUND
IN MEXICO,
THE OTHER ONE HERE.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.767
WHERE'S HIS HOME BASE?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.631
WELL, GIVEN HOW MUCH EASIER
IT IS FOR AN AMERICAN

19:37.670 --> 19:41.379
TO GO BACK AND FORTH
ACROSS THE BORDER,
I'D PUT MY MONEY ON EL PASO.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.241
WE NEED TO DELIVER
THE PROFILE.

19:43.280 --> 19:44.304
YEAH.

19:45.580 --> 19:46.899
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
AN AMERICAN SERIAL KILLER

19:46.950 --> 19:49.578
WHO'S TRYING TO HIDE AMID
ALL THE DRUG WAR VIOLENCE.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.746
HIS MOST RECENT
VICTIMS,

19:50.790 --> 19:53.213
ALL UNDERCOVER
DEA AGENTS,

19:53.260 --> 19:56.218
WERE INVESTIGATING
THE LIBERTAD
DRUG CARTEL.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.228
HIS POSTMORTEM WORK
ON HIS VICTIMS

19:58.260 --> 19:59.727
REQUIRES BOTH PATIENCE
AND DILIGENCE,

19:59.760 --> 20:02.456
SUGGESTING HE'S IN
HIS MID-THIRTIES OR OLDER.

20:02.500 --> 20:05.560
JJ: HE MAY HAVE A HISTORY
OF MENTAL ILLNESS
AND HUNTING SKILLS,

20:05.600 --> 20:07.636
BASED ON THE DISSECT ION
OF THOSE VICTIMS' FACES.

20:07.670 --> 20:08.932
LEWIS: THIS SERIAL KILLER
LIKELY HAD VICTIMS

20:08.970 --> 20:10.961
PRIOR TO THE DEATH
OF THE DEA AGENTS,

20:11.010 --> 20:12.762
AND THOSE BODIES
WERE IN ALL LIKELIHOOD

20:12.810 --> 20:15.278
HIDDEN AMONGST THE NUMEROUS
DRUG CARTEL TARGETS.

20:15.310 --> 20:17.676
THE KILLER KNEW OUR AGENTS
WERE UNDERCOVER,

20:17.710 --> 20:20.816
SO IT HAS TO BE SOMEONE
FROM INSIDE THE CARTEL, RIGHT?

20:20.850 --> 20:23.444
WELL, SINCE ANYONE
COULD JOIN LIBERTAD,

20:23.490 --> 20:26.379
THE UNSUB COULD BE A MEMBER,
BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY CHOICE.

20:26.420 --> 20:30.754
SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE
COULD BE AWARE
OF THE UNSUB'S PREDILECTION

20:30.790 --> 20:32.781
AND HAS BEEN FUNNELING
NEW VICTIMS HIS WAY.

20:32.830 --> 20:35.754
THAT PERSON MAY HAVE
DISCOVERED THE VICTIMS'
TRUE IDENTITIES

20:35.800 --> 20:38.724
OR RESPONDED TO AN ANOMALY
IN THE RECRUITING PA'ITERN.

20:38.770 --> 20:41.694
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT
THE DEA AGENTS WERE
HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME

20:41.740 --> 20:42.695
HI'ITING THEIR
RECRUITMENT NUMBERS.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.335
JOHN PORTMAN HAS PROVIDED
A FACE FOR THE UNSUB.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.679
WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY
TO SAVE SARAH MILES

20:48.710 --> 20:52.771
FROM BEING THE VICTIM
WHO WEARS THAT FACE.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.508
THE FIRST DEAD DEA AGENT
MAY HAVE KNOWN
WHO THE NEXUS WAS

20:57.550 --> 21:00.485
BETWEEN THE INTERNET
AND GROUND OPERATIONS.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.056
DID YOU FIGURE
GRAFF OUT YET?

21:02.090 --> 21:04.979
NO. BUT SOMETHING'S
DEFINITELY WRONG.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.986
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

21:09.400 --> 21:11.868
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW
I'M HAVING THE GROUND
INVESTIGATION

21:11.900 --> 21:13.561
INTO LIBERTAD
SUSPENDED FOR NOW.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.669
I UNDERSTAND.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.691
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN WONDERING.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.037
INSTEAD OF LOOKING
FOR MONTOLO'S HIT MEN,

21:18.070 --> 21:20.732
HAVE YOU TRIED LOOKING
FOR THE DIRTY DOZEN?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.407
DID AXELROD TELL YOU
ABOUT THAT?

21:22.440 --> 21:24.408
AREN'T WE ALL
SHARING INFORMATION HERE?

21:24.450 --> 21:26.873
WE GOT A PROBLEM.
SIMON KAHN, OUR C.I.,

21:26.910 --> 21:28.411
IS DEAD.

21:28.450 --> 21:30.486
HIS CAR EXPLODED
OUTSIDE HIS APARTMENT.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.817
HE WAS COMING TO MEET ME.

21:43.430 --> 21:44.727
JOHN?

33:59.400 --> 34:02.437
OF THE DIABLO GENERAL STORE
IN ESPERANZA VALLEY.

34:02.470 --> 34:03.664
OKEY DOKEY.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.533
UH, LOOKS LIKE THAT STORE
HAS BEEN OWNED

34:06.570 --> 34:08.538
BY THE DUFOUR FAMILY
FOR 60 YEARS,

34:08.580 --> 34:10.798
CURRENTLY MANAGED
BY JACOB DUFOUR.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.546
IT'S CLOSED IN
THE WINTER MONTHS.

34:12.580 --> 34:14.116
WAIT, GARCIA.

34:14.150 --> 34:16.368
GARCIA,
YOU'RE CUTTING IN AND OUT.

34:16.420 --> 34:18.547
I GOT A BAD CELL SIGNAL
OUT HERE. HELLO?

34:18.590 --> 34:19.784
GARCIA: HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

34:19.820 --> 34:21.515
YEAH, YEAH, I GOT YOU.

34:21.560 --> 34:25.155
LOOK FOR RESIDENTS
IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA
WITH SKETCHY HISTORIES.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.726
INCARCERATION--

34:26.760 --> 34:28.648
UH, YOU'RE CUTTING OUT, TOO,

34:28.700 --> 34:30.452
BUT I THINK I GET THE DRIl-T
OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.821
GARCIA.
[CUTTING IN AND OUT]
CALL ME BACK.

34:32.870 --> 34:34.861
HEY.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.198
I GOT CUT OFF.

34:45.610 --> 34:49.876
EH. PROBABLY THE LAST
PAY PHONE LEI-T IN THE STATE

34:49.920 --> 34:51.649
AND IT DOESN'T WORK.

34:51.690 --> 34:52.884
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TRY
BACK UP THE HILL,

34:52.920 --> 34:54.581
SEE IF I CAN GET
A BETTER SIGNAL.

34:54.620 --> 34:57.088
I'LL CHECK OUT
THE NEARBY NEIGHBORS,
SEE WHAT THEY KNOW.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.580
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
SOME COMPANY.

35:30.660 --> 35:31.684
HEY, BABY GIRL.

35:31.730 --> 35:33.823
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I HAVE BEEN CALLING AND CALLING.

35:33.860 --> 35:36.294
HEY, HEY, HEY.
CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN.
I'M HERE NOW.

35:36.330 --> 35:39.629
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO GO TRY TO TALK
TO A NEIGHBOR OR GO TO A FARM.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.194
THEN YOU'D RUN INTO
JACOB DUFOUR HIMSELF.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.662
WHY? WHAT DO YOU GOT
ON HIM?

35:42.700 --> 35:44.759
OH, I HAVE A BOATLOAD OF CRAZY.

35:44.810 --> 35:48.371
HE HAS A HISTORY OF MENTAL
ILLNESS AND ANIMAL CRUELTY
SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER.

35:48.410 --> 35:50.776
IN AND OUT
OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS.

35:50.810 --> 35:55.440
APPARENTLY HE WOULD CUT
THE HEADS AND THE PELTS
OFF OF VARIOUS ANIMALS

35:55.480 --> 35:58.779
AND HE'D WEAR THEM,
AND SAID HE WANTED TO KNOW

35:58.820 --> 36:00.412
WHAT IT FELT LIKE
TO BE IN
SOMEONE ELSE'S SKIN.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.259
GARCIA,
WHERE DOES DUFOUR LIVE?

36:02.290 --> 36:04.451

AND KEEP ME IN THE KNOW.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.583
ALL RIGHT, THANKS, MAMA.
I WANT TO BE SURE OF YOU GUYS.

36:47.730 --> 36:50.233
HOWDY, MA'AM.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.378

36:54.410 --> 36:56.674

36:56.710 --> 36:59.679
I'M THE OWNER

36:59.710 --> 37:00.745
AND YOU ARE?

37:00.780 --> 37:03.544
SPECIAL AGENT TARA LEWIS
OF THE FBI--

37:03.580 --> 37:04.808
[GASPS]
[FIRES TASER]

37:07.550 --> 37:10.212
[GASPING]

37:21.640 --> 37:22.868
FINE. FINE. JUST GO.

37:22.900 --> 37:24.367
GO!

37:32.910 --> 37:33.945
[MOANS]

39:04.710 --> 39:05.608
DON'T LEAVE ME, PLEASE.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.835
I'VE GOT YOU,
I'VE GOT YOU.
I'VE GOT YOU.

39:07.870 --> 39:10.930
OH, PLEASE.
[SOBBING]

39:17.880 --> 39:20.542
AGENT HOTCHNER.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.512
THIS IS A SURPRISE.

39:22.560 --> 39:23.686
DIRECTOR COCHRAN.

39:23.720 --> 39:24.789
MY TEAM FOUND
THE SERIAL KILLER

39:24.830 --> 39:27.390
RESPONSIBLE FOR MURDERING
THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENTS.

39:27.430 --> 39:28.727
HIS NAME IS JACOB DUFOUR.

39:28.760 --> 39:30.625
EXCELLENT.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.098
I ENW THE WORK
THE BAU DOES.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.563
IT MUST BE
SO SATISFYING.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.932
DUFOUR WASN'T WORKING ALONE.

39:37.970 --> 39:41.929
HE HAD A HELPFUL PARTNER
PU'ITING THE VICTIMS
INTO HIS HUNTING ZONE.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.699
DUFOUR DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY WERE DEA AGENTS.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.809
WHO WAS THE PARTNER?

39:48.480 --> 39:49.777
YOU.

39:49.820 --> 39:52.084
ME.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.849
AND HOW
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

39:53.890 --> 39:57.553
IN 2011 THERE WAS A LOCAL
INVESTIGATION

39:57.590 --> 39:59.626
INTO A SERIAL KILLER
WHO WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF THE DRUG VIOLENCE.

39:59.660 --> 40:03.494
YOU REQUISITIONED A FILE
AND FIGURED OUT HOW
THE KILLER WAS OPERATING.

40:03.530 --> 40:05.464
I APPLAUD YOUR THOROUGHNESS,
BUT THIS IS REALLY
UNWARRANTED.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.128
THERE'S $5 MILLION IN BITCOIN
IN A PANAMANIAN BANK ACCOUNT

40:08.170 --> 40:09.637
THAT WE HAVE TRACED
BACK TO YOU.

40:09.670 --> 40:11.638
WELL, THIS IS CLEARLY
A SETUP.

40:11.670 --> 40:12.932
AXELROD, TELL HIM.
TELL HIM.

40:12.970 --> 40:15.131
AXELROD: TAKE HIM.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.068
DO YOU MIND
IF WE BORROW YOUR PEN?

40:19.680 --> 40:23.639
SOMETHING TELLS ME THE ACCESS
CODES TO THE LIBERTAD SERVERS
ARE IN THERE.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.614
WAIT. AGENT HOTCHNER--

40:25.650 --> 40:27.515
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
ON MULTIPLE COUNTS
OF RACKETEERING

40:27.550 --> 40:29.051
AND CONSPIRACY TO MURDER
A FEDERAL AGENT.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.853
COCHRAN: THIS IS A MISTAKE!

40:30.890 --> 40:33.552
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

40:33.590 --> 40:35.228
I COULD USE A DRINK.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.557
HOW ABOUT YOU?

40:36.600 --> 40:39.660
SURE.

40:39.700 --> 40:41.998
YOU KNOW, HOTCH,
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
THREATEN

40:42.040 --> 40:46.136
TO TAKE ME DOWN AGAIN,
I THINK WE COULD
ACTUALLY BE FRIENDS.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.577
SO LIBERTAD'S BEEN
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

40:53.610 --> 40:56.044
YES, BUT ALL OF ITS
COMPETITORS ARE STEPPING IN
AS WE SPEAK.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.241
HOW'S GARCIA DOING?

40:58.280 --> 41:01.010
SHE'S DISAPPOINTED
SHE CAN'T GO HOME,
BUT SHE'S DOING OK.

41:01.050 --> 41:03.655
I'LL BRING HER
A NEW GARDEN TROLL

41:03.690 --> 41:05.578
TO CHEER HER UP
WHEN I GET BACK.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.029
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

41:07.060 --> 41:09.893
I'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
BYE.

41:09.930 --> 41:12.569
AM I RIGHT?
YOU DOING ALL RIGHT?

41:12.600 --> 41:15.091
WELL, UH, I DON'T REALLY
HAVE A CHOICE, DO I?

41:15.140 --> 41:16.698
NO.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.834
WELL, THEN, YES,
I AM HUNKY DORY.

41:19.870 --> 41:22.703
I AM. I'M, UM...

41:22.740 --> 41:24.276
I'M GONNA PUT
SOME SATIN SHEETS ON THAT,

41:24.310 --> 41:25.948
I'M GONNA PUT A SPLASH
OF COLOR OVER THERE.

41:25.980 --> 41:30.576
I'M GONNA PUT SOME TASSELS
ON THAT THING.

41:30.620 --> 41:31.541
I'M SORRY.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.217
I'M SO SORRY.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.888
I KNOW. IT'S ALL RIGHT.

41:34.920 --> 41:36.057
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE FOREVER.

41:36.090 --> 41:38.524
AND...

41:38.560 --> 41:40.084
YOU GOT COCH RAN.

41:40.130 --> 41:41.188
TRUE.

41:41.230 --> 41:43.858
AND HE LAWYERED UP,
BUT HE COULD TALK
AT SOME POINT?

41:43.900 --> 41:45.162
HE COULD.

41:48.170 --> 41:49.569
OK.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.704
HEY, I'M GONNA MAKE MYSELF
A VEGETARIAN OMELET

41:51.740 --> 41:53.105
FOR DINNER.
DO YOU WANT ONE?

41:53.140 --> 41:55.734
WELL, UH...

41:55.780 --> 41:58.601

41:58.650 --> 42:00.208
YOU HAVE JALAPENOS?

42:00.250 --> 42:03.640
UH...UH...I'M SORRY.

42:03.680 --> 42:08.049
UM, DO--DO I HAVE JA--

42:08.090 --> 42:10.615

42:10.660 --> 42:15.120

WITH ALL THINGS
