00:05.785 --> 00:07.162
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:07.328 --> 00:10.832
So, what's the final head count
on my baby shower?

00:11.040 --> 00:13.835
About 20. A couple people from work
who had something else to do.

00:14.002 --> 00:16.004
Also, your sisters called,
neither can make it.

00:16.171 --> 00:18.840
What? You mean they're not coming
to a social event...

00:19.007 --> 00:22.177
...where there's no men and no booze?
That's shocking.

00:23.511 --> 00:25.430
Well, I don't care.
As long as my mom's here.

00:25.847 --> 00:29.601
- Oh, my God. Your mother.
- What, my mom's not gonna be here?

00:29.809 --> 00:31.728
Well, given that we forgot to invite her...

00:31.895 --> 00:34.439
...it would be an awfully big coincidence
if she was.

00:34.856 --> 00:36.858
Oh, my God.

00:37.066 --> 00:39.861
Well, it wasn't my fault.
Phoebe was in charge of the invitations.

00:40.028 --> 00:42.739
Well, I don't have a mother.
So often I forget other people...

00:42.947 --> 00:44.782
Oh, give it a rest.

00:45.575 --> 00:48.203
So my mother is not coming
to my baby shower?

00:48.870 --> 00:50.246
No.

00:50.663 --> 00:51.706
Neither is mine.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.502
You know what? Don't worry.

00:55.668 --> 00:58.463
Okay? We'll take care of it. We'll call her.
You go home and get ready.

00:58.630 --> 01:01.925
Please make sure she comes.
It's really important to me. It's my mom.

01:02.133 --> 01:05.220
- I know. What's her number?
- I don't know.

01:05.428 --> 01:08.431
Go. I have it in my book. Go.

01:14.062 --> 01:17.982
Wait a minute. If you're in charge
of invitations, why am I calling her?

01:18.149 --> 01:21.236
Hello, Mrs. Green.
Hi, uh, it's Monica Geller.

01:21.444 --> 01:23.071
- Oh, hello, Monica.
- Hi.

01:23.279 --> 01:27.158
Um, I know this is last-minute, but we've
decided to throw an impromptu...

01:27.408 --> 01:31.287
- ...baby shower for Rachel today.
- I know. My daughters told me about it...

01:31.454 --> 01:34.499
...when they received their impromptu
invitations a month ago.

01:36.292 --> 01:39.921
- Okay, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- For what, dear?

01:40.088 --> 01:42.215
For not inviting me,
or for lying about it?

01:43.299 --> 01:46.135
Oh, my God. My ass is sweating.

01:48.096 --> 01:51.558
Please, please, can you come?
It's today at 4.

01:52.517 --> 01:56.938
- Well, all right. I'll see you at 4.
- Thank you.

01:57.146 --> 02:00.567
- Isn't it at 3?
- Son of a bitch.

02:40.982 --> 02:42.817
- Hey, Joe. Wanna shoot some hoops?
- Hey.

02:43.109 --> 02:47.196
No, I can't go, I'm practicing. I got an
audition to be the host of a game show.

02:47.363 --> 02:48.448
- Cool.
- Great.

02:48.615 --> 02:51.784
Yeah, and if I get it, by day,
I'll be Dr. Drake Ramoray.

02:51.951 --> 02:55.997
But by night, I'll be Joey Tribbiani.

02:56.623 --> 03:00.251
You'll be perfect for this.
That's already your name.

03:00.668 --> 03:04.047
The audition's in a couple hours,
and I don't even understand the game.

03:04.339 --> 03:05.673
Do you want some help?

03:05.840 --> 03:08.676
Oh, really? That'd be great.
Hey, you guys can be the contestants.

03:08.885 --> 03:10.511
Awesome.

03:10.678 --> 03:14.140
Okay, I guess we can lose
to junior-high girls some other time.

03:14.682 --> 03:18.478
- All right. Let's play Bamboozled.
- Bamboozled?

03:18.686 --> 03:19.687
Isn't that a cool name?

03:19.896 --> 03:20.980
- Yeah.
- No.

03:21.147 --> 03:25.568
All right. Uh, okay.
Our first contestant is Ross Geller.

03:25.777 --> 03:28.321
Why don't you tell us a little bit
about yourself, Ross?

03:28.488 --> 03:32.867
Well, uh, I'm a paleontologist.
Um, I live in New York.

03:33.034 --> 03:37.914
I have a son, Ben. Uh, hi, Ben. And, uh...

03:38.206 --> 03:41.542
I said a little bit, Ross.
Now, how about you, Chandler?

03:41.709 --> 03:45.588
Well, Joey, I'm a headhunter.
I hook up out-of-work Soviet scientists...

03:45.755 --> 03:49.217
...with rogue Third World nations.
Hi, Rasputin.

03:49.425 --> 03:53.096
Excellent. Let's play Bamboozled.
Chandler, you'll go first.

03:53.304 --> 03:56.099
- What is the capital of Colombia?
- BogotÃ©.

03:56.349 --> 03:58.601
It's Bogoda, but close enough.

04:00.770 --> 04:04.941
Now, you can either pass your turn to Ross
or pick a Wicked Wango Card.

04:05.191 --> 04:09.237
- What does a Wicked Wango Card do?
- I should know that.

04:10.405 --> 04:12.740
Let's see.
Just one moment, please, um...

04:12.907 --> 04:19.204
Here we are. A Wicked Wango Card
determines whether you go higher or lower.

04:19.372 --> 04:21.708
Higher or lower than what?

04:22.458 --> 04:27.213
- This is embarrassing.
- Can you believe how lame this is?

04:27.380 --> 04:32.760
I'm sorry. I don't believe contestants
are allowed to talk to each other.

04:35.888 --> 04:39.434
Oh, I told the stripper to be here at 5.
That's good, right?

04:41.644 --> 04:44.939
You ordered a stripper for the shower?
That is totally inappropriate.

04:45.148 --> 04:47.024
Why? He's gonna be dressed as a baby.

04:49.110 --> 04:52.780
Oh, hi, Mrs. Green.
I'm so glad you could make it.

04:52.947 --> 04:55.324
Yes, thank you so much.
And again, we're so sorry.

04:55.491 --> 04:57.118
We could not feel worse about it.

04:57.910 --> 04:59.454
Try.

05:00.663 --> 05:02.457
There's my little girl.

05:03.124 --> 05:05.293
- She's still mad.
- Yeah, I know.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.504
Isn't it great? One less person
we have to make small talk with.

05:08.963 --> 05:12.967
Phoebe, Sandra's mad at you too.
It doesn't bother you?

05:13.134 --> 05:17.138
Look, we've apologized twice.
I can't do any more than that.

05:17.305 --> 05:19.807
I know you hate it when people
are mad at you...

05:19.974 --> 05:23.102
...but, you know,
you just have to be okay with it.

05:23.269 --> 05:26.606
Okay. I can do that. Heh.

05:26.773 --> 05:30.026
- I gotta go powder my ass.
- Oh.

05:30.318 --> 05:33.321
Look at that face.
Just like when you were in high school.

05:33.488 --> 05:37.950
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were a cheerleader in trouble.

05:38.117 --> 05:39.660
- Come on, let's get some tea.
- Okay.

05:39.827 --> 05:43.164
Ooh, my. Look at that.
Only three weeks to go.

05:43.331 --> 05:44.832
Now, have you picked your nanny yet?

05:44.999 --> 05:46.876
I don't want you to just use
your housekeeper...

05:47.043 --> 05:48.544
...because it'll just split her focus.

05:48.711 --> 05:52.840
Oh. Actually, I'm not gonna use a nanny.
And, uh, I don't even have a housekeeper.

05:53.049 --> 05:54.967
It's like you're a cave person.

05:56.969 --> 05:58.679
Rachel, you must get a nanny.

05:58.846 --> 06:01.098
You don't know how overwhelming
this is gonna be.

06:01.265 --> 06:04.477
When you were a baby,
I had full-time help. I had Mrs. K.

06:04.644 --> 06:08.648
Mrs. K. Oh, yeah, she was sweet.
She taught me Spanish.

06:08.815 --> 06:11.526
I actually think
I remember some of it:

06:16.489 --> 06:19.200
- Such a sweet woman.
- Yeah.

06:19.450 --> 06:22.370
Well, however great she was,
I just can't afford that.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.205
- Oh, Rachel.
- What?

06:24.372 --> 06:28.209
I just had the greatest idea.
I'm gonna come live with you.

06:29.001 --> 06:31.003
What? What?

06:31.212 --> 06:34.674
Oh, I'm so happy I'm gonna
do this for my little girl.

06:35.716 --> 06:39.512
Aw, look at you.
You have tears in your eyes.

06:41.055 --> 06:43.850
Yes, yes, I do.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.978
All right, Ross, you're in the lead.

06:47.186 --> 06:50.481
Would you like to take another question,
or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

06:50.690 --> 06:54.402
The Wheel has not been
my friend tonight, Joey. Uh...

06:54.569 --> 06:56.404
I'll take another question.

06:56.612 --> 06:59.031
Okay. This is gonna be tough.
Hold your breath.

06:59.198 --> 07:00.658
It's okay. I'm ready.

07:00.825 --> 07:03.911
No, dude, you gotta hold your breath
till you're ready to answer the question.

07:04.078 --> 07:07.081
- It's part of the game.
- This is ridiculous. He's not gonna hold...

07:08.416 --> 07:14.714
Okay. What do you have a fear of
if you suffer from this phobia? Triska...

07:14.881 --> 07:18.968
Holy cow. That's a big word. Tris...

07:19.135 --> 07:21.596
Seriously, look at this thing, Chandler.
How do you say that?

07:21.762 --> 07:23.431
- Let me see that.
- This one right here.

07:25.933 --> 07:28.769
- Triskaidekaphobia.
- Fear of Triscuits.

07:28.936 --> 07:33.316
- No. No. Fear of the number 13.
- Fear of Triscuits?

07:33.566 --> 07:36.944
It's possible.
They have really sharp edges.

07:38.321 --> 07:39.780
All right, Chandler, you're up.

07:40.031 --> 07:43.618
Wait a minute. I believe I'm entitled
to use my Angel Pass for a free turn.

07:43.784 --> 07:48.122
- This game makes no sense.
- You're just upset because you're losing.

07:48.289 --> 07:50.875
Oh, come on, Ross.
I think we're all losers here.

07:52.919 --> 07:56.672
All right. Chandler, you can either
spin the Wheel or pick a Google Card.

07:56.839 --> 08:00.468
Let me think, let me think.
Oh, uh, I don't care.

08:02.428 --> 08:04.096
You must choose, Mr. Bing.

08:04.263 --> 08:08.643
- Either. It makes no difference.
- Choose, you jackass.

08:09.644 --> 08:13.272
- I'll take a card.
- Okay, you picked the Gimme Card.

08:13.439 --> 08:16.567
- You get all of Ross' points.
- What?

08:17.318 --> 08:18.986
This game is kind of fun.

08:20.154 --> 08:23.282
You don't think it's a little crazy
that you get all my points...?

08:23.491 --> 08:26.869
I don't think the contestants
are supposed to speak to each other.

08:29.664 --> 08:33.125
- Why did you invite my mother?
- What?

08:33.292 --> 08:36.587
She wants to move in with me and Ross
to help take care of the baby.

08:36.837 --> 08:39.173
- For how long?
- Eight weeks.

08:39.340 --> 08:43.094
I mean, I love my mother, but, my God,
a long lunch with her is taxing.

08:44.095 --> 08:47.098
I personally would be honored
if she wanted to live with me.

08:47.306 --> 08:48.349
She can't hear you.

08:51.018 --> 08:52.687
You guys, come on.
What am I gonna do?

08:52.853 --> 08:56.065
If you don't want your mother
to move in with you, just tell her.

08:56.857 --> 08:59.860
You're right. You're right.
I'm about to have a baby.

09:00.027 --> 09:03.197
I can tell my mother that I don't want her
to be sleeping on my couch.

09:03.364 --> 09:06.701
Oh, my God. She's gonna wanna sleep
in my bed with me. This cannot happen.

09:06.867 --> 09:07.994
That's right. That is right.

09:08.160 --> 09:11.163
You go over there and tell her
you do not want her to live with you.

09:11.330 --> 09:13.624
- Do not take no for an answer.
- Okay.

09:14.542 --> 09:18.462
This is great.
Now she's gonna be mad at Rachel.

09:19.380 --> 09:23.718
And I'm just gonna swoop in there
and be like the daughter she never had.

09:25.136 --> 09:27.263
I have new respect for Chandler.

09:29.765 --> 09:34.061
All right, everybody.
It's time to open the presents.

09:34.228 --> 09:37.231
Yes, and I think that the first gift
that Rachel opens...

09:37.398 --> 09:39.859
...should be from the grandmother
of the baby.

09:40.026 --> 09:44.405
Because you're the most important person
in this room. And in the world.

09:46.407 --> 09:49.827
Well, um, I don't have a gift because
I wasn't invited until the last minute.

09:49.994 --> 09:54.206
But thank you so much, dear,
for bringing that to everybody's attention.

09:56.751 --> 10:00.629
How about you less important people?
Let's open your presents.

10:02.256 --> 10:06.218
- Mom, it's okay that you didn't get a gift.
- Well, I kind of did.

10:06.385 --> 10:08.721
- Me. Eight weeks of me.
- Yeah.

10:08.888 --> 10:12.725
Okay. See, Mom, the truth is,
I can do this on my own.

10:12.892 --> 10:15.644
Sweetheart, I know you're gonna be
a terrific mom.

10:15.811 --> 10:18.856
I just think you need a little help,
especially at the beginning.

10:19.023 --> 10:21.609
But, Mom, I really know what I'm doing.
I can handle this.

10:21.776 --> 10:23.611
Really? Remember Twinkles?

10:23.819 --> 10:27.782
He was a hamster.
I'm not gonna vacuum up my baby.

10:27.948 --> 10:31.285
Okay, come on, Rach.
It's present time.

10:31.452 --> 10:34.455
You know, you're the glue
holding this whole party together.

10:34.622 --> 10:36.999
It's kind of falling apart here.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.377
- Ooh, look.
- Wow.

10:40.544 --> 10:42.254
This is from your friends at work.

10:42.421 --> 10:48.094
Ooh, my gosh. Oh, wow.
Oh, I know what this is.

10:48.260 --> 10:50.096
Wait a minute.

10:50.262 --> 10:53.224
That can't be right.

10:53.808 --> 10:56.435
Is that a beer bong for a baby?

10:57.978 --> 11:00.314
Darling, that's a breast pump.

11:00.815 --> 11:07.279
Heh. Did I say I was done guessing?
Okay, thank you for that.

11:07.488 --> 11:10.032
Ooh, wow. What's this?

11:10.282 --> 11:13.828
- It's a Diaper Genie.
- Oh, it dispenses clean diapers.

11:13.994 --> 11:15.955
No, it's where you put dirty ones.

11:16.330 --> 11:20.167
Well, that's gross. Why don't you just
take it outside and throw it in a Dumpster?

11:20.334 --> 11:25.339
- You're gonna do that 10 times a day?
- What, it goes 10 times a day?

11:25.506 --> 11:28.050
What are we feeding this baby,
Indian food?

11:28.676 --> 11:31.387
No, dear. That's what babies do.

11:31.679 --> 11:34.890
Rachel, listen to your mother.
She is very smart.

11:37.601 --> 11:41.897
Plus, what are you planning on doing with
the baby while you trot out to the garbage?

11:42.523 --> 11:44.900
I don't know,
I'd leave it on the changing table?

11:46.318 --> 11:50.364
- What? What did I do? What did I do?
- You can't leave a baby alone.

11:51.490 --> 11:53.200
Of course, I know that.

11:53.367 --> 11:56.245
I mean, of course you never
leave a baby alone. Ha, ha.

11:56.412 --> 11:58.873
I mean, it would...
She wouldn't be safe.

11:59.290 --> 12:03.210
You know, not as safe as she would be
with me, the baby dummy. Ha, ha.

12:03.377 --> 12:07.298
Okay, you know what? Opening the
presents is a little overwhelming right now.

12:07.464 --> 12:10.843
So I think, um, I'm just gonna maybe
open them all a little bit later.

12:11.010 --> 12:13.554
But thank you all for coming,
and for these beautiful gifts...

12:13.721 --> 12:17.850
- ...and this basket is beautiful.
- It's actually a bassinet.

12:19.393 --> 12:22.563
Okay, Mommy, don't ever leave me.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.611
In what John Huston film
would you hear this line:

12:28.777 --> 12:30.696
"Badges? We don't need
no stinking badges."

12:30.863 --> 12:32.448
- Treasure of the Sierra Madre.
- Correct.

12:32.615 --> 12:34.033
There's a possible Backwards Bonus.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.578
- Madre Sierra the of Treasure.
- Yes.

12:37.995 --> 12:40.706
I'd like to go up the Ladder of Chance
to the Golden Mud Hut, please.

12:40.873 --> 12:42.208
- Wise choice. How many rungs?
- Six.

12:44.585 --> 12:49.006
- That noise can only mean one thing.
- Hungry Monkey.

12:49.423 --> 12:53.219
- I'd like a Wicked Wango Card.
- Okay. It's an audio question.

12:53.385 --> 12:55.930
Name this television theme song:

12:58.766 --> 13:01.602
Oh. Oh, my God. Okay, I know this.
Give me a second.

13:01.810 --> 13:03.771
- Tell it to the Time Turtle.
- Shut up.

13:03.938 --> 13:06.148
- I Dream of Jeannie.
- Yes. Yes, you're back in the lead.

13:06.315 --> 13:07.691
Uh, I'd like to spin the Wheel.

13:13.948 --> 13:15.032
Oh, come on.

13:15.199 --> 13:18.077
Uh, uh, Super Speedy Speed Round.

13:18.244 --> 13:21.038
- Is there a Hopping Bonus?
- Of course.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.752
- Who invented bifocals?
- Ben Franklin.

13:26.919 --> 13:29.755
Correct. Which monarch
has ruled Great Britain the longest?

13:29.964 --> 13:31.215
- Queen Victoria.
- Correct again.

13:31.423 --> 13:34.969
But you forgot to switch legs between
questions. So no Hopping Bonus.

13:35.135 --> 13:38.013
- Oh! Every time.
- Yeah.

13:38.180 --> 13:41.558
- Now over to Chandler.
- I'd like a Google Card.

13:42.351 --> 13:47.064
- Are you sure?
- Yes. No. Google.

13:48.649 --> 13:52.403
Oh, my God. Congratulations, Ross.
Because, Chandler...

13:52.569 --> 13:54.738
- ...you've been Bamboozled.
- No!

13:54.947 --> 13:59.743
- Yes!
- This is the best game ever!

14:01.078 --> 14:03.539
So, um, you're gonna stay with me
as long as I need you?

14:03.706 --> 14:06.375
- Of course I am.
- Mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.

14:06.542 --> 14:09.545
I read all kinds of books on pregnancy
and giving birth.

14:09.795 --> 14:14.049
But I just didn't think to read the part
about what to do when the baby comes.

14:14.216 --> 14:15.926
And, guess what, the baby's coming...

14:16.093 --> 14:19.972
...and I don't know what to do.
Oh, can I throw up in my Diaper Genie?

14:20.180 --> 14:24.435
Oh, sweetie, you're gonna be fine.

14:24.810 --> 14:27.855
- Wait, where you going?
- I'm going to the bathroom.

14:28.063 --> 14:31.734
Now, don't worry.
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:33.694 --> 14:35.904
It is gonna be okay.

14:40.034 --> 14:42.202
Worth a shot.

14:43.704 --> 14:45.205
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:45.372 --> 14:46.957
Why are you all red and sweaty?

14:47.207 --> 14:49.710
I just Bamboozled Chandler.

14:52.755 --> 14:55.090
Which is not a sexual thing.

14:57.092 --> 14:59.887
- Well, that was a quick shower.
- Not if you were here.

15:01.722 --> 15:03.557
Wow, looks like we got
a lot of good stuff.

15:03.724 --> 15:06.560
We did. But my mom got us
the greatest gift of all.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.729
A Play-Doh Barbershop?

15:09.897 --> 15:14.026
No. She's going to live with us
for eight weeks.

15:14.276 --> 15:15.652
What?

15:15.861 --> 15:19.656
Yes. She's gonna help us
take care of the baby. Woo-hoo.

15:20.574 --> 15:22.743
You're not serious.

15:22.910 --> 15:24.411
I mean, she's a very nice woman...

15:24.578 --> 15:27.247
...but there's no way we can take
eight weeks of her.

15:27.414 --> 15:29.458
- She'll drive us totally crazy...
- Hi, Ross.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.835
Hey, roomie.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.969
Hey, Joey, hi, I'm Ray.
I'm the producer of the show.

15:41.178 --> 15:43.847
It's a pleasure to meet you, Ray.

15:44.473 --> 15:47.267
And this is Duncan and Erin.
They're gonna help out with the audition.

15:47.434 --> 15:48.769
So let's get the camera rolling.

15:48.936 --> 15:52.940
- Righty-0, Ray.
- Whenever you're ready.

15:53.148 --> 15:57.694
Hello. I'm Joey Tribbiani.
Let's play Bamboozled.

15:57.903 --> 16:02.533
Erin, you get the first question. In hockey,
who is known as "The Great One"?

16:02.783 --> 16:03.951
- Wayne Gretzky.
- Correct.

16:04.159 --> 16:08.038
Now, would you like to pick a Wicked
Wango Card or spin the Wheel of Mayhem?

16:08.288 --> 16:11.458
Uh, Joey, didn't your agents
give you the revised rules?

16:11.625 --> 16:14.711
We've eliminated all that.
No wheel. No cards.

16:14.878 --> 16:16.213
What? Why?

16:17.047 --> 16:21.385
Well, the game was too complicated and
research showed people didn't follow it.

16:21.552 --> 16:25.389
What's complicated? You spin the Wheel
of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance...

16:25.556 --> 16:28.892
...past the Mud Hut through the
Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey.

16:29.059 --> 16:32.229
You yank his tail, and boom,
you're in Paradise Pond.

16:32.855 --> 16:34.773
Yeah. All that's gone.

16:34.940 --> 16:38.360
Um, it's basically just a simple
question-and-answer game now.

16:38.569 --> 16:41.029
Well, what's fun about that?

16:41.196 --> 16:43.073
You expect me to be the host
of a boring game...

16:43.240 --> 16:45.492
...that's just people standing around
answering questions?

16:45.659 --> 16:48.412
Well, there'll be women in bikinis
holding up the scores.

16:48.620 --> 16:51.540
Let's play Bamboozled.

16:51.707 --> 16:54.418
And all those dinosaur
knickknacks you have...

16:54.585 --> 16:57.588
...Ross, I thought they might be
more at home in the garage.

16:57.880 --> 17:02.342
- Well, we don't have a garage.
- Did I say garage? I meant garbage.

17:04.428 --> 17:09.433
You know what, Mrs. Green? Maybe it's
not absolutely vital that you live with us.

17:09.599 --> 17:15.314
- Well, Rachel needs help with the baby.
- I do. I really do. I don't know anything.

17:15.481 --> 17:17.191
I'm sure that's not true.

17:17.398 --> 17:20.234
Oh, no? Pheebs, Monica,
do I know anything about babies?

17:20.402 --> 17:23.489
- Nope. Not a thing.
- Mm-mm. It's frightening.

17:23.696 --> 17:26.782
Well, um, you know what?
Even if she doesn't know anything, I do.

17:26.992 --> 17:30.204
I have a son.
His mother and I didn't live together.

17:30.370 --> 17:33.957
Whenever he was with me,
I took care of him all the time, by myself.

17:34.833 --> 17:38.003
- That's true. You do have another child.
- Yeah.

17:38.170 --> 17:40.547
With another woman.

17:40.756 --> 17:42.716
Have you no control, Ross?

17:46.094 --> 17:47.346
That's a different issue.

17:49.223 --> 17:53.977
Um, the point is, when the baby comes,
I will be there to feed her...

17:54.144 --> 17:55.812
...and bathe her and change her.

17:55.979 --> 17:58.690
And more than that,
I want to do all those things.

18:00.192 --> 18:02.694
Well, then you don't need me
to live with you.

18:02.861 --> 18:04.404
Yes!

18:05.531 --> 18:08.951
Yes. You're gonna be so missed.

18:09.409 --> 18:10.911
You're gonna be a great father.

18:11.078 --> 18:13.455
Well, you're gonna be
a wonderful grandma.

18:13.830 --> 18:17.834
Hello? I still don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

18:18.043 --> 18:21.338
Come on, every first-time mother
feels that way.

18:21.505 --> 18:27.511
You're gonna pick it up. Hey, you will.
Look, when you first came to the city...

18:27.678 --> 18:30.347
...you were this spoiled,
helpless little girl...

18:30.514 --> 18:33.016
...who still used Daddy's credit cards,
remember?

18:33.433 --> 18:35.644
I hope you're going somewhere with this.

18:36.436 --> 18:39.273
Look at you. You're this big executive.

18:39.439 --> 18:42.150
You are much more capable
than you give yourself credit for.

18:42.359 --> 18:45.821
I have no doubt you're gonna
be an incredible mother.

18:46.738 --> 18:49.866
- Really?
- I'm telling you.

18:50.784 --> 18:52.661
Thank you.

18:55.038 --> 18:57.124
All right, you two. I'm gonna get going.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.002
- Oh.
- Oh, no, sweetheart, you stay put.

19:00.210 --> 19:03.964
I'll let myself out. It's like I'm not here.
Which I almost wasn't.

19:06.341 --> 19:11.597
You're just so funny. You're so funny.
What do I do?

19:11.972 --> 19:15.809
Nothing. You have apologized
to her like a million times.

19:15.976 --> 19:18.312
And she's been nothing
but terrible to you.

19:18.478 --> 19:20.439
And don't forget,
you just threw her daughter...

19:20.606 --> 19:24.568
...a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower.

19:24.735 --> 19:29.823
- And she hasn't even thanked you for it.
- You know what? You're right.

19:30.073 --> 19:33.118
Yeah, I mean, if you wanna
say anything to her, I'd tell her off.

19:33.285 --> 19:34.828
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

19:36.288 --> 19:38.582
Okay, I will.

19:38.790 --> 19:41.126
Mrs. Green?

19:41.376 --> 19:42.836
Mrs. Green?

19:43.003 --> 19:45.922
It is rude to leave a party
without saying goodbye to the host.

19:46.131 --> 19:48.508
And also, when someone
apologizes to you...

19:48.675 --> 19:50.761
...the decent thing to do is to accept it.

19:50.927 --> 19:53.388
Because what I did to you,
it wasn't on purpose.

19:53.555 --> 19:57.225
But what you're doing to me now
is plain spiteful.

19:57.434 --> 19:58.769
- Spiteful?
- That's right.

19:59.019 --> 20:02.898
Maybe it's time you took a good,
hard look in the mirror, young lady.

20:03.065 --> 20:04.816
Old lady.

20:05.025 --> 20:06.818
Lady.

20:07.027 --> 20:09.863
Wrap it up. Wrap it up. Wrap it up.

20:10.739 --> 20:15.661
So whenever you're ready to apologize
to me, I will forgive you. Good day.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.167
I can't feel my legs.

20:22.918 --> 20:25.837
You were fantastic.
I'm so proud of you.

20:26.463 --> 20:30.050
- Yeah? I'm proud of me too.
- You should be.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.844
- Could you get me something to drink?
- You got it.

20:34.888 --> 20:38.266
Mrs. Green? Okay, I'm really sorry.
I apologize. If you just... Aah!

20:41.186 --> 20:43.939
Okay. I bit my tongue.

20:44.606 --> 20:47.943
But I'm still really sorry.

20:54.491 --> 20:56.576
- Okay, I'm ready.
- You sure?

20:56.743 --> 20:59.705
Yes. I've done my studying,
and I really know my stuff.

20:59.913 --> 21:02.082
All right, then.

21:03.500 --> 21:06.378
Rachel Green, let's play Bamboozled.

21:07.003 --> 21:09.756
How do you test the temperature
of the baby's bathwater?

21:09.923 --> 21:12.050
- Uh, put your elbow in it.
- Excellent.

21:12.259 --> 21:16.596
- How do you put a baby down for a nap?
- Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.

21:16.763 --> 21:17.848
That's correct.

21:18.056 --> 21:22.102
This is an audio question. What do you do
when a baby makes this sound:

21:27.065 --> 21:29.651
Uh, check if it's wet,
check if it's hungry, burp it.

21:29.860 --> 21:34.781
Excellent. Now, do you want another
question or a Wicked Wango Card?

21:35.031 --> 21:38.452
- A card. A card. I pick a card.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:38.618 --> 21:42.372
You've been Bamboozled.
You're gonna be a terrible mother.

21:45.792 --> 21:48.462
I've lost sight of why
we're doing this.
