00:39.539 --> 00:42.201
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.566
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.370
Previously on The 4400:

00:48.548 --> 00:50.778
I've been offered a job

00:50.950 --> 00:53.043
working with the children
at the school.

00:53.219 --> 00:55.153
I blew the surprise, didn't l?

00:55.321 --> 00:57.551
I just wanna make one thing clear.

00:58.058 --> 01:01.050
Me breaking up with Danny
has nothing to do with you.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.319
Okay.

01:05.131 --> 01:06.462
What are you doing here?

01:06.633 --> 01:08.328
I'm the guy who killed you.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.068
Is this list complete, huh?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.672
Because I'm just wondering
how many 4400s you did kill.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.772
What's up? Who are these guys?

01:17.944 --> 01:20.344
They've been brought in
to help expedite the interrogation.

01:20.513 --> 01:25.143
I know you find this hard to believe,
Tom, but we are on the same side.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.486
One of our members
has been compromised.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.451
I have to assume
he's gonna give up my name.

01:29.622 --> 01:32.648
If you know where Armand is,
we'll tell NTAC. They'll take care of it.

01:32.826 --> 01:36.125
Daniel Armand's inside. He's all yours.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.897
This is it.
The last member of the Nova Group.

01:43.069 --> 01:44.593
It's the last one
we know about, anyway.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.671
If this tip is good
and we bring in Gary Navarro,

01:46.840 --> 01:48.933
this could pretty much
be the end for the Nova Group.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.167
The tip is good.

02:03.723 --> 02:05.782
All right, here they are. Let's go.

02:08.527 --> 02:09.722
Move. Move.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.796
Gary! It's over!

02:21.708 --> 02:23.471
- Go. Go.
- Downstairs.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.309
- Room searched.
- You two, that way.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.575
- Got it.
- Clear.

02:28.748 --> 02:30.545
Check over here.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.344
Clear, sir.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.884
There's nobody here.

02:35.922 --> 02:38.083
Looks like he just left.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.886
In the middle of making lunch?

02:45.064 --> 02:48.090
He must have known we're coming.
Someone must have tipped him off.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.042
Isabelle.

02:59.245 --> 03:00.769
Isabelle.

03:01.447 --> 03:03.278
You're not hearing me.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.973
Sure, I did.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.379
You said you don't wanna
be with me anymore.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.583
I just don't see why.

03:09.756 --> 03:11.519
The Nova Group's gone.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.182
My dad knows about us now.

03:15.428 --> 03:17.225
There's nothing to stop us
from being together.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.957
Yes, there is.

03:20.133 --> 03:21.862
Me.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.469
This is because of what happened
to Matthew, right?

03:24.637 --> 03:25.865
You think I killed him.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.507
And the people
from the Nova Group too.

03:29.709 --> 03:33.145
I wasn't in my right mind, lsabelle,
so I don't know what happened.

03:33.313 --> 03:34.678
Well, then I'll tell you.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.611
Matthew had a stroke,
some terrorists died

03:37.784 --> 03:40.651
and you got better.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.879
What's to question?

03:44.424 --> 03:50.056
I just think that you and l
got a little too intense, too fast.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.994
See, I thought that was the best part.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.963
Sorry for the interruption.

04:00.139 --> 04:01.606
Shawn, there's someone here
to see you.

04:02.075 --> 04:05.476
She's a friend of yours.
She says it's important.

04:11.951 --> 04:13.441
Nikki. Oh, my God.

04:14.287 --> 04:15.845
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

04:16.555 --> 04:18.956
It's been a long time, Shawn.

04:19.459 --> 04:20.687
Yeah.

04:22.161 --> 04:24.322
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:24.497 --> 04:27.933
- I should have called first.
- No.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.693
No, it's fine.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.336
You look great. How have you been?

04:31.504 --> 04:35.406
Good. Good. School's kind of fun.

04:36.809 --> 04:38.936
It's just...

04:39.112 --> 04:40.636
My father.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.206
He's been sick.

04:42.849 --> 04:44.316
Oh, your dad? I'm sorry to hear that.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.009
It's cancer.

04:48.021 --> 04:49.818
It's in his pancreas.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.620
There's nothing they can do.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.590
Shawn?

04:55.662 --> 04:58.153
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

04:59.499 --> 05:02.024
I just need to deal with this thing now.

05:02.201 --> 05:04.499
So we'll talk later, okay?

05:06.506 --> 05:07.803
Okay.

05:10.810 --> 05:15.543
So, Amy, you used to call
your grandmother Mimi?

05:15.715 --> 05:19.674
Yes. I'd go stay with her
for two weeks every year.

05:20.620 --> 05:24.818
But when I came back
with all the other 4400s,

05:25.325 --> 05:27.384
my mom told me she was gone.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.549
Alana Mareva?

05:29.796 --> 05:31.627
We're from
the National Security Agency.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.924
You need to come with us.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.627
What is this about?

05:34.801 --> 05:36.860
The Pentagon has commissioned
a study on the membership

05:37.036 --> 05:38.526
and the origins of the Nova Group.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.337
We've been authorized
to interview all persons of interest.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.997
And why would I be
a person of interest?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.440
Ma'am, we have a list.
Your name is on it.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.675
Let's not make a scene
in front of the child.

05:50.149 --> 05:53.482
How did my name get on the list?
What am I being accused of?

05:53.653 --> 05:57.521
We have evidence that suggests
you're a member of the Nova Group.

07:06.626 --> 07:07.684
I wrote a check.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.419
My friend, Ryan, at the Center,

07:11.597 --> 07:14.191
came up to me one day
about six weeks ago.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.130
He said he couldn't pay his power bill.

07:16.302 --> 07:19.601
They were gonna shut it off
if he didn't come up with the money.

07:20.506 --> 07:23.304
It was a small loan, $1 65.

07:23.476 --> 07:26.138
- No big deal, right?
- Ryan Freel?

07:27.847 --> 07:29.041
We picked him up three days ago.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.842
He's one of the names
Daniel Armand gave us.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.545
So they were right. He was in Nova.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.119
They say they can hold me

07:39.292 --> 07:42.455
for providing financial support
to terrorists.

07:42.628 --> 07:45.222
It was just a loan, Thomas.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.161
How long are they
gonna keep me here?

07:47.533 --> 07:51.162
They can hold you for questioning,
without any charge, for 36 hours.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.828
But it's not gonna come to that.
This is harassment.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.236
It's not gonna continue.
I'm gonna talk to Ryan Freel.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.468
I'll get him to admit
that this is just a casual thing.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.407
That it had nothing to do with Nova.

08:00.813 --> 08:05.045
Alana, I promise this is all
gonna be over soon, just--

08:05.818 --> 08:08.343
Just sit tight, okay?

08:09.322 --> 08:11.017
I love you.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.694
I know it's frustrating,
but there's nothing we can do.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.565
Nina, it's harassment, pure and simple.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.467
Yeah, I know it is.
And I don't like it either.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.665
But the Nova Group
made a lot of people nervous.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.743
Now that it's broken, the military wanna
make sure that it's dead and gone.

08:32.912 --> 08:33.900
Yeah, we all do.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.913
It's still no excuse to hold an innocent
woman based on absolutely nothing.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.072
Well, I agree.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.946
But the Pentagon
went around us on this one.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.107
They went private.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.346
They hired the Haspel Corporation
to conduct the study.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.855
Haspel Corp? They do a lot
of defense contracting, don't they?

08:46.025 --> 08:48.016
Yeah, right now, they're focusing
on this Nova report.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.287
NSA even loaned them agents
to do field work.

08:51.964 --> 08:55.593
Now some conglomerate has
the right to arrest and detain people?

08:55.768 --> 08:57.258
Where is the oversight?

08:57.436 --> 08:59.768
There isn't a lot.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.633
Look, this whole thing
runs on the discretion

09:01.807 --> 09:03.434
of the executive in charge of the study.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.775
So who's this executive?

09:08.114 --> 09:11.277
I appreciate your frustration, Tom.

09:12.518 --> 09:15.248
It's unfortunate that your girlfriend
got involved in this mess.

09:17.256 --> 09:19.315
But my people are just being thorough.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.085
Your people?

09:21.961 --> 09:25.488
Alana's being held
by the National Security Agency.

09:25.665 --> 09:27.758
The way I remember it,
your life in public service ended

09:27.934 --> 09:29.834
with a perp walk through NTAC.

09:30.002 --> 09:32.300
Yeah, there were
some unpleasant moments.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.302
But that's the past.

09:34.473 --> 09:38.603
I was censured for my part in the
inhibitor scandal, I guess you'd call it.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.269
"Scandal"? Why don't you try
"murderous plot."

09:41.647 --> 09:44.207
Your opinions
are already a matter of record.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.851
Not that the majority of people
agree with you.

09:47.553 --> 09:51.649
Anyway, after the government saw fit
to terminate my employment,

09:52.425 --> 09:56.759
I weighed my offers
and wound up here. Haspel Corp.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.454
And Alana just happened to wind up
in your crosshairs, right?

09:59.932 --> 10:02.025
Tom, do you think
I would use your girlfriend

10:02.201 --> 10:05.261
to prosecute some kind
of personal vendetta?

10:05.438 --> 10:07.303
Actually, Dennis, yeah, I do.

10:08.374 --> 10:11.241
So that's his punishment
for causing the deaths of 28 4400s?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.571
A six-figure consulting gig
and a corner office.

10:13.746 --> 10:14.906
Don't act so surprised, Tom.

10:15.081 --> 10:18.346
We always knew Ryland
had a lot of support for what he did.

10:27.360 --> 10:28.691
Learning anything new?

10:29.028 --> 10:30.689
Yeah. She's incredible.

10:30.863 --> 10:34.355
In a week, we've made discoveries
we thought it would take years to get to.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.023
Where'd you find this girl?

10:39.071 --> 10:40.732
He didn't find me.

10:44.443 --> 10:45.842
I found him.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.406
Shawn.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.808
It's all right, Jimmy.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.684
Hey.

10:56.689 --> 10:58.418
That was amazing.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.657
It looks like my father could walk
out of here this afternoon.

11:02.828 --> 11:03.817
Good.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.623
And I know my whole family
just thanked you again and again

11:07.800 --> 11:10.394
but I wanted to say it too.

11:10.569 --> 11:13.561
- So thanks.
- It's all right, Nikki.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.773
You look so different.

11:18.010 --> 11:21.639
Last time I saw you, I don't think
you even owned a belt.

11:21.814 --> 11:25.181
You used to wear the same
flannel shirt every day for a week.

11:26.752 --> 11:28.947
A lot's changed, I guess.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.282
And now you're doing so great.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.087
Kind of makes me wonder
why you never call

11:36.262 --> 11:38.730
just to say hi, you know?

11:41.567 --> 11:45.697
I was just trying to put everything
behind me, I guess.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.604
But I thought about you a lot.

11:54.647 --> 11:57.582
- I've gotta go, I guess.
- Yeah.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.724
Tell your dad not to hurry back
to the office, okay?

12:08.894 --> 12:11.192
He always was a workaholic.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.803
We just got the phone records
in from Gary's safe house.

12:26.979 --> 12:29.072
A call came in at 1 1 :1 4 a.m.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.641
Eleven-fourteen?
That's right before we got there.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.580
It's a tip-off call. It had to be.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.914
It came from inside the 4400 Center.

12:37.823 --> 12:40.121
Look, I really don't know what to say.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.527
I can't tell you why that call
came from my office,

12:43.863 --> 12:45.228
but I didn't make it.

12:45.397 --> 12:48.628
Heather, we've got phone records
that say it came from your extension.

12:49.368 --> 12:51.632
You said the call
was made around 1 1 :1 0, right?

12:53.038 --> 12:54.630
Then there's no way
it could have been me.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.297
I was teaching a class
from 1 1 to noon.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.210
I was standing in front
of 1 2 students for the entire hour.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.777
I never left the room.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.811
Anyone else have access
to your office?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.875
Just the janitor. But you'd have
to ask Maintenance about that.

13:06.051 --> 13:09.782
We will. We'll need to talk
to your students as well.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.256
Look, Heather,
NTAC isn't the only organization

13:13.425 --> 13:14.949
investigating the Nova Group.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.527
There's gonna be a lot of people
looking at those phone records.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.789
They're all gonna be less friendly
than we are.

13:19.965 --> 13:21.193
Sorry, guys.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.097
It's like I said. I was in class.

13:24.270 --> 13:26.204
That's all I know.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.337
I got a little worried about you
this afternoon.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.948
You were gone all day again.

13:38.117 --> 13:39.379
I was out walking.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.819
I like to do that now.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.993
Dad, I need you to talk to Shawn.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.854
Tell him he can't break up with me.
It would be a mistake.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.893
I can't do that.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.993
For one thing, I don't think it is.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.828
I know how much it must hurt
right now, but you'll get over it.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.665
Don't talk to me like I'm a teenager.

14:05.377 --> 14:08.574
There are things I have to do.
They're going to be really hard.

14:08.747 --> 14:09.907
Dangerous.

14:10.115 --> 14:13.573
And if Shawn's not with me,
it's gonna make things worse.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.584
Worse for who? You?

14:15.754 --> 14:18.188
No. Everyone else.

14:19.124 --> 14:21.058
And what if he says no?

14:21.961 --> 14:23.929
Be more convincing.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.196
Heather. What's up?

14:31.570 --> 14:33.697
I need to talk to you.

14:35.274 --> 14:38.710
Listen, I've been thinking
all day about this.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.641
I didn't tell you everything
this afternoon.

14:42.748 --> 14:45.546
There was someone
who had the key to my office.

14:46.085 --> 14:50.112
Okay, this person,
I need to know who it was.

14:50.856 --> 14:54.883
Tom, it was Alana.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.000
I didn't wanna say anything
in front of your partner.

15:03.168 --> 15:05.159
I'm sure you understand why.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.869
Tom, did Alana know

15:09.041 --> 15:11.066
that you found out
where this guy Gary was living?

15:11.510 --> 15:13.705
Yeah. Yeah, she did.

15:15.714 --> 15:18.012
I was on the phone with her
when the tip came in. I told her.

15:18.183 --> 15:19.980
She knew we'd been
chasing Gary for a long time.

15:23.322 --> 15:24.949
Heather, come on, it wasn't Alana.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.217
There has to be
some other explanation.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.985
I hope so.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.620
And I hope you find it.

15:32.197 --> 15:33.664
But what do I do while you're looking?

15:34.400 --> 15:37.267
You said it yourself, you're not the only
one with access to those records.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.666
You're not the only one
who's gonna come asking questions.

15:39.838 --> 15:43.001
You tell anyone who asks the
same thing you told me this afternoon.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.040
Your alibi checks out.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.234
Unless you say differently,

15:46.412 --> 15:50.246
no one is gonna be able to prove you
lent that key to Alana or anyone else.

15:51.183 --> 15:53.515
Heather, Alana didn't make that call.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.778
If you just stick to your story for one
more day, this whole thing will be over.

15:58.357 --> 15:59.483
What if I say no?

15:59.658 --> 16:02.183
She comes after me? You?

16:02.361 --> 16:04.090
I don't know.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.788
I know she's determined
to get you back.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.833
It's like she sees you
as her one connection to the world,

16:10.002 --> 16:12.266
to people, to a normal life.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.565
So, what you're saying
is it's like my job,

16:14.740 --> 16:16.799
to keep her, I don't know, human?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.069
It sounds that way, doesn't it?

16:20.179 --> 16:22.807
Look, Shawn...

16:23.983 --> 16:27.009
...I'm not trying to tell you what to do.
But I do know this.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.721
Isabelle's not giving up.
Not without a fight.

16:32.424 --> 16:35.882
And we've both seen what happens
when my daughter decides to fight.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.548
Is everything all right, Thomas?

17:00.919 --> 17:04.685
Don't think about it as informing.
You're helping us catch a criminal.

17:05.357 --> 17:08.348
Now, I need you to tell me, who
did you lend Heather's office key to?

17:09.962 --> 17:11.554
Sweetie, please. This is important.

17:11.730 --> 17:14.493
Somebody compromised
our investigation.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.267
I didn't give the key to anyone.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.829
It was me, Thomas.

17:21.406 --> 17:23.840
I called Gary Navarro.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.118
I don't understand.
Are you a member of the Nova Group?

17:41.293 --> 17:43.625
- No, of course not.
- Then why?

17:45.664 --> 17:47.427
I trusted you.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.799
I told you what we were doing
and you used it to betray me.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.460
I wasn't betraying you. I did it for you.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.467
How many times have I heard you say
that you felt responsible

17:57.643 --> 17:59.110
for what happened to Gary Navarro?

17:59.711 --> 18:01.269
He came to you for help

18:01.447 --> 18:04.610
and instead the government used him
and turned him against his own kind.

18:04.783 --> 18:09.277
I don't like what happened to Gary.
But he chose to become a terrorist.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.646
He joined Nova of his own free will.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.348
Gary wasn't with the Nova Group
anymore.

18:13.525 --> 18:16.426
What?
How would you even know that?

18:16.595 --> 18:18.586
A lot of people at the Center know it.

18:19.064 --> 18:21.532
After the Nova Group
had T.J. Kim murdered,

18:21.700 --> 18:23.258
he turned his back on them.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.766
How can you even believe that?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.337
Gary personally tried to murder
Dennis Ryland.

18:27.506 --> 18:32.000
Ryland is responsible
for the death of 28 4400s.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.975
Twenty-eight people that might
have changed the world for the better,

18:35.147 --> 18:36.546
were they allowed to live.

18:37.249 --> 18:40.309
He declared war on us.
I almost died, Thomas.

18:40.486 --> 18:42.010
All Gary did was fight back.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.678
You should have told me
what you were gonna do.

18:45.924 --> 18:47.789
I wanted to.

18:48.293 --> 18:49.988
But I couldn't.

18:50.162 --> 18:51.857
You were bound by your job.

18:52.030 --> 18:54.055
You couldn't give Gary
another chance.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.860
So I did it for you.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.935
And now you're gonna stand trial
right alongside of him.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.002
You made that phone call
from the Center.

19:02.174 --> 19:04.472
It's right there
on Gary's phone records.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.237
They'll figure it out it was you, Alana.

19:08.547 --> 19:11.448
So, what?
Am I supposed to lie for you now?

19:11.617 --> 19:13.778
Am I supposed to become
Gary's accomplice too now?

19:13.986 --> 19:16.648
I'm not asking you to do anything,
Thomas.

19:17.156 --> 19:21.786
If you want to turn me in, fine.
But I believe I did the right thing.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.493
And I hope the man I love
would believe it too.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.738
Nikki, if I did pay off
your dad's hospital bill--

19:33.906 --> 19:35.874
And I'm not admitting to anything.

19:36.608 --> 19:40.442
--let's just say
that it's not that big of a deal, okay?

19:40.612 --> 19:43.479
I'm glad to do something
with my money.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.613
Giving up my social life to work
seven days a week at this place

19:46.785 --> 19:48.844
has to have its perks, right?

19:49.354 --> 19:52.812
I have a hard time believing
that you don't have a social life.

19:52.991 --> 19:54.720
Running this place is a big job.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.623
You know,
it kind of cuts you off from the world.

19:59.531 --> 20:03.297
Well, I don't have $60,000.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.860
But if you're feeling isolated,

20:06.038 --> 20:08.666
you know, maybe I can
pay you back in another way.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.944
There's a new sushi place
that opened in Belltown.

20:17.115 --> 20:18.742
It's supposed to be pretty cool.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.612
You like sushi now?

20:21.253 --> 20:23.813
You're not the only one
who can change.

20:26.091 --> 20:27.683
Just give me a second, okay?

20:31.597 --> 20:32.791
Hey, Shawn.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.694
Have you seen my copy
of The Republic in here?

20:34.866 --> 20:37.061
No, you know what? I haven't seen it.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.265
Hello again. I'm lsabelle.

20:41.206 --> 20:43.834
Nikki. Nice to meet you.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.404
I've heard of you.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.378
Well, let me know if you find my book.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.483
I'm right in the middle of it.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.255
So tomorrow night?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.519
You wanna check out
this new sushi place?

21:04.596 --> 21:05.620
Yeah.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.464
Oh, my God.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.659
Tom, I'm so sorry.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.631
Anything I can do to help?

21:15.941 --> 21:17.238
I don't know.

21:17.409 --> 21:20.742
I don't know what I can do.
I can't just turn Alana in.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.513
If we do catch Gary,
eventually he's gonna give her up.

21:26.685 --> 21:28.812
So, either way, her life is ruined.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.545
Well, Tom, there's no way
you can try

21:30.722 --> 21:32.417
and shake this agency off
Gary's scent.

21:32.591 --> 21:33.888
You'll wind up a felon yourself.

21:34.760 --> 21:38.457
I have to do something, Diana.
We're talking about Alana.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.259
And one way or another, we've been
together for more than a decade.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.963
I have to protect her.

21:46.705 --> 21:50.368
Once I know she's safe,
then I can figure out how we move on.

21:51.009 --> 21:52.033
If we move on.

21:52.210 --> 21:54.678
You need to keep yourself safe too.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.306
I think that the best thing
that we can do,

21:57.482 --> 21:59.780
the only thing we can do...

22:00.519 --> 22:02.578
...is to take ourselves off this case.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.020
And do what?

22:06.558 --> 22:08.549
Cross our fingers.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.655
Hope Gary buys himself
a one-way ticket to Costa Rica.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.608
What did you expect to happen?

22:28.347 --> 22:31.805
I don't know.
But it's only for 36 hours, right?

22:31.983 --> 22:35.282
- That's all they can hold her for.
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.415
They can hold her for as long
as it takes to investigate her alibi.

22:38.590 --> 22:40.387
We're talking about
Dennis Ryland here.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.186
You told me a dozen times,

22:42.361 --> 22:44.795
he'll do whatever it takes
to get information.

22:44.963 --> 22:48.023
He's going to interrogate her
and I don't know how far it's gonna go.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.567
Alana, I'll call his office
in the morning.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.764
I checked out
Heather's alibi myself.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.967
I'll give them my notes.
It'll all go on the record.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.172
Right now it's all I can do.

23:11.256 --> 23:16.888
You know, I'm always happy
to talk to one of the 4400.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.621
But I have to say,

23:20.432 --> 23:24.732
I was surprised to find you
waiting outside my office this morning.

23:24.903 --> 23:29.306
You can release Heather Tobey.
That phone call to Gary Navarro,

23:29.474 --> 23:31.635
I was the one who made it.

23:40.285 --> 23:43.777
Dennis, thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.789
What were you thinking, Tom,

23:50.028 --> 23:52.622
to get romantically involved
with a 4400?

23:52.798 --> 23:55.596
What Alana did was misguided.
It was wrong.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.563
But Gary wasn't part
of the Nova Group anymore.

23:57.736 --> 24:01.331
Are you actually gonna stand here
and defend Gary Navarro to me?

24:02.674 --> 24:06.474
The Nova Group isn't a bridge club.
You don't just leave.

24:06.645 --> 24:08.636
Even if Gary tried to,

24:08.814 --> 24:12.978
that doesn't absolve his other crimes,
which include attempted murder.

24:13.151 --> 24:15.551
If the doctors had gotten to me
30 seconds later,

24:15.720 --> 24:16.778
I would have been dead.

24:16.955 --> 24:19.185
I know how badly
you want him, Dennis.

24:19.357 --> 24:23.225
If it was up to me, Gary Navarro
would never even make it to trial.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.659
Okay, forget about Gary.

24:26.898 --> 24:28.456
Can we just concentrate on Alana?

24:28.633 --> 24:31.830
Well, I'm afraid it's not possible
to make that distinction.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.198
They're kind of intertwined,
aren't they, Tom?

24:34.372 --> 24:37.864
Alana will be prosecuted like
any other member of the Nova Group.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.738
She's not a member
of the Nova Group.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.838
Dennis.

24:44.649 --> 24:46.082
Dennis.

24:47.519 --> 24:50.010
We've known each other
for 25 years.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.419
You have to help me.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.890
Like you helped me
when my back was to the wall?

25:04.703 --> 25:07.297
Okay, I'm not a petty man, Tom.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.601
I'll honor our relationship.

25:11.443 --> 25:12.967
Thank you.

25:13.645 --> 25:15.545
I appreciate anything you can do.

25:16.581 --> 25:19.573
I'll tell NSA
you had nothing to do with this.

25:20.519 --> 25:24.455
You may be a dupe,
but you're not a traitor.

25:25.657 --> 25:27.318
And as for Alana,

25:27.492 --> 25:30.893
the best chance of seeing mercy
is to cooperate fully

25:32.163 --> 25:34.688
and help us find Gary Navarro.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.594
Now you wanna catch
Gary Navarro?

25:37.769 --> 25:41.865
Tom, we've already passed
the case off to Roth and Tierney.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.632
We've got to get him before they do.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.572
We've got to get him before
Ryland does. Before anyone.

25:46.745 --> 25:50.806
Look, Ryland wants Gary.
It's a personal thing.

25:50.982 --> 25:53.348
If we get can get Gary first,
we can deal with Ryland directly.

25:53.518 --> 25:56.681
A straight-up trade. Gary for Alana.

25:57.088 --> 26:00.683
So Ryland gets his hands on Gary
and it happens with no official record.

26:00.859 --> 26:04.295
No arrest.
None of that sticky due process.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.830
You really think
that Ryland's gonna agree to that?

26:06.998 --> 26:09.990
If we dangle Gary in front of him?
In a heartbeat.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.795
Look, Tom, l...

26:11.970 --> 26:14.165
You saved my daughter's life.

26:14.339 --> 26:18.070
I owe you everything for that
and I'll do what you want here.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.337
But this is dangerous.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.913
And it's a lot of trouble to go to for...

26:26.418 --> 26:28.443
...a woman
who just betrayed you.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.851
I owe her that much. More than that.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.491
My son is incarcerated, Diana.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.786
Alana's been right there with me
all the way through it.

26:39.030 --> 26:42.966
And she doesn't deserve to rot in some
secret prison for the rest of her life.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.765
Well,

26:47.505 --> 26:49.666
any idea where we'd start?

26:51.076 --> 26:52.100
Yeah.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.316
Hey, Shawn.

27:03.788 --> 27:05.312
Isabelle.

27:05.690 --> 27:06.782
What are you doing in here?

27:08.526 --> 27:10.221
I came by to talk.

27:10.762 --> 27:14.357
I know you're still thinking about us,
but we're still friends, right?

27:14.532 --> 27:15.692
I can still drop by.

27:16.101 --> 27:18.661
Well, lsabelle, usually friends knock.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.361
What's up?

27:22.240 --> 27:24.470
I came to talk to you about Nikki.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.268
I know you pretty well.

27:27.746 --> 27:29.373
I don't think
she's the right girl for you.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.976
Well, I don't know
why you think she's my girl.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.511
You're entitled to your opinion,
though, I guess.

27:37.856 --> 27:40.620
I'm just trying to protect you.

27:41.226 --> 27:46.858
I just have this feeling
that if you guys get together...

27:49.367 --> 27:51.198
...it's going to end badly.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.769
Isabelle, what does that mean?

27:55.940 --> 27:58.841
- Are you threatening Nikki now?
- Of course not.

27:59.010 --> 28:00.944
Why would I threaten Nikki?

28:01.112 --> 28:06.482
It's just, I have this feeling
that if you two hook up,

28:06.651 --> 28:08.846
it's not going to end well.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.052
Not for you.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.014
Especially not for her.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.017
It's always harder on the girl,
you know?

28:22.400 --> 28:23.697
Hey.

28:26.237 --> 28:27.261
Are you doing okay?

28:28.106 --> 28:29.801
Yeah, more or less.

28:31.276 --> 28:34.939
I want to help you, Alana.
I want to get you out of here.

28:35.613 --> 28:38.480
- I don't think you can.
- I do.

28:39.851 --> 28:41.341
I think there's a way,

28:42.020 --> 28:43.612
but I need you to trust me.

28:49.327 --> 28:51.192
I think you should cooperate
with Dennis Ryland.

28:52.597 --> 28:54.622
Tell him whatever he wants to know.

28:56.167 --> 28:58.533
I can't do that, Thomas.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.501
That would be a betrayal.

29:02.307 --> 29:04.298
Learn to live with it.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.267
Listen to me, if you don't cooperate,

29:06.444 --> 29:08.241
I don't think you're ever
gonna get out of here.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.142
I can't.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.953
Then I can't help you.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.814
Thomas.

29:23.328 --> 29:24.659
I was supposed to take the students

29:24.829 --> 29:27.093
on a field trip to the aquarium
this afternoon.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.964
I need you to go there
and leave them a note.

29:33.138 --> 29:36.505
There's a bulletin board
outside the aquarium.

29:36.941 --> 29:42.004
You should put it there
and it should say "field trip canceled."

29:42.180 --> 29:44.876
Some of the kids will show up
with their parents.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.113
When you see them,

29:49.287 --> 29:51.812
give them my apologies.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.486
I'll make sure they understand.

30:08.606 --> 30:11.268
It was a code. At least I think it was.

30:11.442 --> 30:13.637
She was telling me
how to get ahold of Gary.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.213
Well, I don't know, Tom.
It's already been two hours.

30:17.949 --> 30:20.474
Let's give it another 1 5 minutes.

30:24.756 --> 30:26.189
Diana.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.425
Gary, stop!

30:38.937 --> 30:41.405
- Oh, my God.
- Get down, get down.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.038
- Move along.
-Get down, get down, get down.

30:47.612 --> 30:48.943
- Look out.
- Get out of the way.

30:57.255 --> 30:59.723
Look out, look out.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.525
Get out of the way.

31:04.229 --> 31:07.392
- Hey.
- Go get the gun.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.157
Come on.

31:09.634 --> 31:10.965
Get the kids, get the kids.

31:12.303 --> 31:13.600
Look out, get back.

31:14.639 --> 31:17.301
- Go, move.
- Watch out, watch out.

31:23.281 --> 31:25.909
Don't move, Gary. Don't move.

31:27.585 --> 31:28.677
It's over, Gary.

31:31.089 --> 31:33.057
Come on, get up.

31:38.963 --> 31:41.397
So you're gonna turn me over
to Ryland.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.669
You know
what he's gonna do to me, right?

31:45.837 --> 31:48.305
Ryland is gonna interrogate me.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.602
Yeah, you know all about that.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.167
You've seen that firsthand.

31:54.145 --> 31:56.670
And then he's going to
disappear me.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.748
No trial. No record.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.443
I'm not a mind reader, Gary.
Not like you.

32:02.620 --> 32:04.815
I have no idea
what Ryland's gonna do with you.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.583
That's how you get through this
hand-off with your conscience intact?

32:07.759 --> 32:11.354
All right, you wanna know?
I'm trading you for Alana.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.660
She helped you, now it's your chance
to help her. You owe her that much.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.597
You made your own bed, Gary.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.362
Nobody forced you to join Nova.
Nobody forced you to kill people.

32:19.537 --> 32:22.165
I was a baseball player.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.509
I was worried
about making the major leagues.

32:28.413 --> 32:29.971
That's it.

32:30.882 --> 32:34.511
If I hadn't met you two,
I'd be shagging grounders right now.

32:40.558 --> 32:44.255
Okay, you should go.
If you still want to, that is.

32:44.429 --> 32:47.523
But if you make this deal with Ryland,
it's forever.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.190
I mean, we live with this.

32:52.437 --> 32:54.302
I'll call you after the meet.

32:54.472 --> 32:56.997
You're gonna have to
move him right away.

32:59.944 --> 33:02.538
Seven-thirty, on the nose.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.044
I gotta say, I'm impressed.

33:05.249 --> 33:09.015
A big mogul like you,
figured that you'd keep a girl waiting.

33:12.857 --> 33:14.620
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:15.893 --> 33:17.326
You ready to go?

33:17.495 --> 33:18.757
Nikki,

33:19.297 --> 33:20.821
Iisten, we can't do this.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.969
Do what? Dinner?

33:25.136 --> 33:27.536
Shawn, it's not a big deal.
That's what people do at night.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.602
You know this is about
more than just dinner.

33:34.779 --> 33:37.441
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to stand you up.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.447
I just can't do this right now.

33:42.453 --> 33:43.852
Shawn, I don't get it.

33:44.422 --> 33:45.411
What happened?

33:45.590 --> 33:48.252
Did some adviser tell you
that I don't fit in with your PR strategy?

33:48.426 --> 33:50.656
No, nothing like that.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.070
It's gonna sound like
a stupid guy thing.

34:03.541 --> 34:07.671
Me leaving here right now
is the best thing I can do for you.

34:13.117 --> 34:14.914
All right, then.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.418
Go.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.596
Bye.

34:33.137 --> 34:37.164
So, Tom, I'm guessing

34:37.909 --> 34:44.041
that if I don't agree
to this trade you're proposing,

34:44.782 --> 34:48.377
you're not gonna drop Navarro off
at the nearest police station, are you?

34:48.553 --> 34:49.815
You say no

34:49.987 --> 34:53.081
and you can forget about
getting your hands on Gary Navarro.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.083
I'll get him a passport,
a plane ticket.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.126
He'll be in a Third World country
by this time tomorrow.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.260
And if I decide to play along?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.160
You want to know whether I'll be
asking questions about Gary Navarro

35:05.336 --> 35:06.963
after you drive away with him?

35:09.140 --> 35:10.539
No,

35:11.175 --> 35:12.836
I won't be.

35:14.245 --> 35:18.306
It's gonna be tricky to make
the charges against Alana go away.

35:19.383 --> 35:22.409
You can do it, Dennis.
I have faith in you.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.033
Let's go.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.040
Listen, take this key ring.

35:52.216 --> 35:55.242
The blue key
opens a safe-deposit box.

35:55.419 --> 35:59.651
There are eight letters inside,
and I'd appreciate it if you'd mail them.

35:59.824 --> 36:02.384
These letters,
who are they addressed to?

36:03.194 --> 36:06.960
Eight families. All over the world.

36:07.131 --> 36:09.361
Your NSA work.

36:09.534 --> 36:12.867
Those are the families of the 4400s
that you helped target.

36:14.805 --> 36:17.831
Right. I figure...

36:18.643 --> 36:20.372
...it's time to let them know
what happened.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.275
Give them a sense of closure.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.344
Seems like the least I can do.

36:26.751 --> 36:29.879
Seems like the only thing I can do,
actually.

37:09.227 --> 37:10.751
You okay?

37:19.203 --> 37:20.295
I'm sorry.

37:20.938 --> 37:24.396
It's all right.
I know it wasn't your idea.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.311
Nice working with you again, Tom.

37:48.866 --> 37:50.163
Well, that went well.

37:54.071 --> 37:57.006
Tell me, why do I have
such a weird feeling in my stomach?

37:58.609 --> 38:00.600
It's not easy
to sentence a man to death.

38:13.057 --> 38:15.150
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

38:15.826 --> 38:16.884
Quiet back there.

38:17.728 --> 38:20.561
It's all right. Let him pray.

38:21.299 --> 38:22.857
Forgive us our trespasses as we...

38:29.040 --> 38:31.270
Look out. Pull over.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.518
Get out of the car. Get out.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.484
Keep your hands
where I can see them. Up.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.880
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

38:47.058 --> 38:49.390
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.998
Tom, you need to think about this.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.260
Tom, you're letting a terrorist
walk free.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.200
No, I was a soldier.
You created me.

39:01.739 --> 39:03.764
All I did was switch sides.
Well, guess what?

39:03.941 --> 39:06.205
Now I'm done fighting.

39:06.444 --> 39:09.413
- I'm walking away from the war.
- There is no walking away.

39:09.580 --> 39:12.481
You've got numerous federal charges
hanging over your head,

39:12.650 --> 39:14.447
including attempted murder.

39:14.618 --> 39:16.779
Murderers walk free
all the time, Dennis.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.889
Some of them even get cushy jobs
at Fortune 500 companies.

39:20.057 --> 39:21.615
Very cute, Tom.

39:21.792 --> 39:24.192
Have you thought about
what this means for your girlfriend?

39:24.362 --> 39:27.923
Making her a fugitive is kind of
a funny way of showing your love.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.464
I'd rather be on the run

39:29.633 --> 39:33.626
than be responsible
for handing over a 4400 to you.

39:35.639 --> 39:38.608
Skouris, you're supposed to be
the level-headed one.

39:38.776 --> 39:41.142
Are you really gonna
throw your career away

39:41.312 --> 39:44.338
because your partner
is on some personal crusade?

39:44.515 --> 39:46.415
Oh, I don't see it that way, Dennis.

39:46.584 --> 39:49.382
And if you want to hold on to your job,
you won't say anything about this.

39:49.820 --> 39:53.654
A 4400 you personally signed out
of a military detention facility?

39:54.058 --> 39:57.118
A secret trade in a remote location?
It's all kind of messy.

39:57.928 --> 40:02.297
I'm guessing this one
stays off the books.

40:06.904 --> 40:07.996
Let's go.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.243
Nice working with you again, Dennis.

40:36.066 --> 40:39.263
There's two lDs in there, and there's
enough cash to last you for a while.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.632
The Canadian border's
about 30 miles away.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.536
I'd-- I'd cross as soon as you can.
Ryland will be looking.

40:46.076 --> 40:47.475
Yeah.

40:56.220 --> 41:01.283
You know, it's been almost two years
since I've met you two.

41:02.493 --> 41:05.018
And I remember that you said
that you would help me.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.994
Well, it's been a long time coming,
but I guess you finally came through.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.060
Thank you.

41:19.810 --> 41:22.540
I didn't want us to end, Thomas.
Ever.

41:24.315 --> 41:28.615
And especially not here, like this.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.914
It doesn't have to end.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.250
I can come with you.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.821
You can't.

41:38.863 --> 41:40.922
You need to be here.

41:41.432 --> 41:44.265
You're one of the only good men
left in this fight.

41:44.435 --> 41:48.235
I'll find a way to bring you back.
I promise.
