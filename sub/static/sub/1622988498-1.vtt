WEBVTT

01:32.092 --> 01:34.226
Oh, thank God.

01:34.228 --> 01:35.263
That took forever.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.433
Seven hours is way
too long in this car.

01:45.072 --> 01:45.872
Is this it?

01:46.907 --> 01:48.741
Yep, looks like it.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.292
Hey, turn that off, now!

02:05.359 --> 02:06.992
What do you think you're doing?

02:06.994 --> 02:10.362
This is a restricted
government area, okay?

02:10.364 --> 02:12.531
GPS could track us.

02:12.533 --> 02:13.532
Turn it off.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.769
Look, completely off.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.872
I don't think you realize
how risky this is.

02:20.874 --> 02:23.611
We can get into a lot of
trouble if we get caught here.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.579
You really think someone's
gonna catch us out here?

02:27.581 --> 02:29.147
The place is deserted.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.617
We haven't seen anything or
anyone in the last five hours.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.286
That doesn't matter.

02:34.288 --> 02:38.125
This place has been
completely off limits, okay?

02:39.593 --> 02:42.263
We don't wanna be leaving
any electronic footprints.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.098
Come on, let's go.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.815
Here, take one of these.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.686
It's just a precaution
for the radiation.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.354
Okay.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.723
They told us to it in Chernobyl.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.059
It's the best thing for us.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.937
This is so lifeless.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.308
What actually happened here?

04:01.975 --> 04:04.177
What made it like this?

04:05.713 --> 04:09.182
Well, I mean, it's all
speculation, nobody knows for sure.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.519
It was about 50 years ago
there was a massive spike

04:13.521 --> 04:18.526
in radiation worldwide and
everything pointed to this area.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.361
But it is safe, right?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.532
Oh, yeah, I mean
safer than it were.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.300
It's prolonged exposure
that causes the damage,

04:28.302 --> 04:31.102
we're only here a short time.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.806
That's why we took
the precautions.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.674
It must be safer now, right?

04:35.676 --> 04:39.545
I mean, this place has
been abandoned for ages.

04:39.547 --> 04:40.381
Well, yeah.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.483
Come on.

05:08.275 --> 05:11.810
This place, people
used to live here.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.412
Sure did.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.049
There's a nuclear
weapons facility

05:16.984 --> 05:19.451
just over the horizon there.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.086
That's the best lead we've got,

05:21.088 --> 05:23.391
so that's where
we're gonna head.

05:26.394 --> 05:31.397
It's government-owned
and when the meltdown,

05:31.399 --> 05:36.404
or whatever it is happened,
killed everyone in sight.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.738
Why didn't everyone
not know about this?

05:39.740 --> 05:40.572
Who?

05:40.574 --> 05:41.409
National security?

05:42.443 --> 05:44.309
I mean, a facility like that,

05:44.311 --> 05:46.478
that needs to be
kept covered up,

05:46.480 --> 05:48.680
especially during the Cold War.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.617
Then, of course, when
whatever happened happened

05:51.619 --> 05:54.319
well they couldn't exactly come
clean about it, could they?

05:54.321 --> 05:56.790
I mean, that would be
death to any government.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.660
I mean, it's all speculation,
nobody knows for sure

06:01.662 --> 06:03.361
what else happened.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.431
The radiation is that high?

06:05.433 --> 06:09.470
Well, either that or they
were covering something up.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.170
Right.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.104
Do you think it's
wise to head towards

06:13.106 --> 06:14.241
the facility at this time?

06:15.676 --> 06:18.744
Why don't we just explore
for now and come back later?

06:18.746 --> 06:22.380
What, and get
pictures of dead trees?

06:22.382 --> 06:23.250
I don't think so.

06:24.652 --> 06:27.955
If that's where this started,
that's where we're headed.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.538
Bizarre.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.539
What was that?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.042
Some kind of bear?

06:50.911 --> 06:52.112
I guess so, yeah.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.247
Strange.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.717
Well should be
wary of it, the bear?

06:58.719 --> 07:01.655
No, we'll be fine.

07:03.423 --> 07:08.128
We keep out of its way,
he keeps out of our way.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.098
We're safe, we're fine.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.806
You see, if something's
living around here

07:20.173 --> 07:24.042
then it means the radiation
levels are fine, okay?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.511
Nothing to worry about.

07:25.513 --> 07:28.647
But surely the radiation
level's too high.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.949
Well, obviously not.

07:30.951 --> 07:35.086
I mean, there's
something alive out here.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.624
Are you sure that was a bear?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.728
Possibly, yeah.

07:44.632 --> 07:45.864
Come on.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.615
I've never heard a
bear sound like that.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.358
What the hell was that?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.893
Christ knows.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.564
You saw that too, right?

08:17.464 --> 08:18.664
Yeah.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.467
Look, whatever it is, it's gone.

08:21.835 --> 08:26.171
It might've been a mutated
bird that's morphed

08:26.173 --> 08:28.876
from the radiation
over the decades.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.809
Maybe.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.843
This doesn't feel right, Paul.

08:31.845 --> 08:32.679
We should go.

08:34.147 --> 08:35.280
This is what we're here for.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.717
We get a photograph of that,

08:37.918 --> 08:41.385
our channel is gonna
blow up, all right?

08:41.388 --> 08:45.757
Screw the nuclear facility,
this is what we're after.

08:45.759 --> 08:46.594
No, no, no.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.227
This doesn't feel right.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.063
I'm going.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.251
Oh, my God, Paul.

09:41.014 --> 09:41.849
Fuck!

09:43.917 --> 09:44.752
Paul.

11:32.692 --> 11:33.593
I'm retired.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.527
- I'm done with this.
- Hey, hey, hey.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.063
Listen.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.831
Hear me about before
you jump to what

11:39.833 --> 11:41.401
you will and won't do, hey?

11:43.336 --> 11:45.470
What can you tell me about it?

11:45.472 --> 11:50.443
There has been multiple
reports, strange sightings.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.546
All describing
something similar.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.848
What?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.053
A winged creature.

12:02.089 --> 12:06.758
Now, these reports, they
center around an abandoned

12:06.760 --> 12:09.096
restricted government facility.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.004
What would we
be expected to do?

12:18.605 --> 12:21.272
I want you to pick two
members of your squad,

12:21.274 --> 12:24.876
two people you trust, okay?

12:24.878 --> 12:26.947
You will go immediately.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.414
This can't be like last time.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.482
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.584
Mistakes were made
on both sides.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.986
Tell me about it.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.523
This, however, I
can assure you will be

12:38.525 --> 12:41.628
a swift in and out job.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.629
And if we find the
creature what are

12:44.631 --> 12:46.397
we supposed to do with it?

12:46.399 --> 12:50.437
It can be retrieved
alive or dead.

12:51.738 --> 12:52.772
Preferably alive.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.741
Once obtained you
contact me immediately.

12:56.743 --> 12:59.310
And what if it
can't be obtained?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.379
Bring me back something.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.613
Anything.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.718
We need to know what
is going on there.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.186
Are we done?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.155
That'll be all.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.846
So he literally didn't
tell you more than that?

13:34.848 --> 13:38.149
Just go to an abandoned
area and hunt a creature?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.717
Yep.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.352
And how are we supposed
to know what to look for?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.820
This is so vague.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.623
Yeah, I know, but it's
always like this on covert ops,

13:45.625 --> 13:47.825
it's a need-to-know basis.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.361
We should be given every
detail no matter how trivial.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.230
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.832
We're gonna meet two people
there who have more information.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.234
By the way, there's no signal

13:56.236 --> 13:58.436
so you can forget about a phone.

14:07.915 --> 14:08.748
Hey.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.418
It's not gonna be
like last time.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.194
All right, let's get going.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.098
Good morning.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.567
I'm Professor Stuart Pulson
from Stroud University.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.936
You must be the officers
we were told to expect?

15:04.938 --> 15:06.471
And I'm Nicole.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.373
I'm sort of a local, I live
a few miles away from here.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.841
Got in contact
about the sightings.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.410
I'm a mountaineer, so
I'll be able to help

15:12.412 --> 15:14.145
you with any tough terrain.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.081
- How was your journey?
- It was good.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.984
- I'm Ness, Lexy.
- Hi.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.151
- Libby.
- Hi.

15:20.153 --> 15:21.819
- Nice to meet you.
- Let us help.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.188
We'll brief you inside.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.722
- Come on.
- Thank you for coming

15:24.724 --> 15:27.792
and apologies you've been
kept somewhat in the dark.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.860
It's not been without reason.

15:29.862 --> 15:32.097
We felt it best to
brief you in person

15:32.099 --> 15:35.200
and to limit the spread
of classified information.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.402
Why is a nuclear
scientist here?

15:37.404 --> 15:40.238
Well, no doubt
you're aware, this entire area

15:40.240 --> 15:42.909
falls under a strict
government control zone.

15:44.344 --> 15:48.079
Yeah, and it's been like
that for like 30 years.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.483
Indeed, and will be for
hundreds more to come.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.419
This area used to be a
nuclear weapons facility,

15:54.421 --> 15:56.923
but in recent years
has become repurposed

15:58.125 --> 16:00.591
for the storage of
radioactive waste.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.792
What?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.261
You're quite
safe, don't worry.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.230
The levels around here
are not substantial enough

16:05.232 --> 16:07.765
to cause any significant
level of harm.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.767
The radioactive waste
itself is buried

16:09.769 --> 16:12.537
within the hills and
mountains all around us.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.706
However, a consequence of
this is that the whole area

16:15.708 --> 16:18.145
should be devoid
of all wildlife.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.247
There have been
sightings here.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.483
Exactly, and it
doesn't make sense.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.054
If something has evolved to
withstand radiation exposure,

16:29.056 --> 16:32.192
then it could be of great
scientific interest to us.

16:33.660 --> 16:37.097
However, if this unearthed,
unofficially, shall we say,

16:37.964 --> 16:39.566
it's a potential PR nightmare.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.502
So, we've been recruited
to search a radioactive zone

16:44.504 --> 16:47.374
and hunt a mutated monster.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.775
No, absolutely not.

16:50.777 --> 16:51.611
Wait a moment.

16:54.281 --> 16:58.083
These pills are high
strength potassium iodine.

16:58.085 --> 17:01.552
They protect against
prolonged radiation exposure.

17:01.554 --> 17:04.555
Take these and the
mission is little more

17:04.557 --> 17:05.825
than a wild animal hunt.

17:08.395 --> 17:11.030
Here, a map of the
sightings in the area.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.368
So, we're at the
epicenter of it?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.874
Here are a few
sketches by eyewitness.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.083
Um, what are those?

17:32.085 --> 17:32.885
They wings?

17:34.954 --> 17:36.389
We don't know what it is,

17:37.857 --> 17:41.261
but it's your job to get out
there and to bring it back.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.971
I don't trust it.

17:53.973 --> 17:54.905
Look what happened last time,

17:54.907 --> 17:56.607
I was told the exact same thing.

17:56.609 --> 18:00.645
Look, we'll be safe as
long as we take the pills.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.547
Look what happened last time!

18:02.549 --> 18:05.350
Last time I was told
the exact same thing.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.786
Look how far you've come.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.554
You were in a
wheelchair and told

18:09.556 --> 18:11.689
you would never walk again.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.759
Hey, breathe.

18:16.563 --> 18:19.799
Look, I promise you
I will protect you.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.169
You won't be in
danger, all right?

18:24.171 --> 18:25.803
Hm?

18:25.805 --> 18:29.242
This is the last mission
and after it I'm done

18:31.478 --> 18:33.380
and it's up to you what you do.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.885
It's just like
hunting a wild animal.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.354
Here.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.155
That a girl.

18:44.157 --> 18:44.991
Come.

18:53.300 --> 18:57.402
I'm thinking we get
in and we get out

18:57.404 --> 18:59.005
of there as quickly as possible.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.573
Don't you think
we should turn back?

19:02.575 --> 19:03.410
No.

19:04.611 --> 19:08.112
But it only needs one of
us to go, not all of us.

19:08.114 --> 19:08.981
Not necessary.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.918
I don't think it's safe.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.587
The safest way forward is
for us all to stay in a group.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.023
That means no wandering
off on your own.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.361
Ness, you know the protocol
for this kinda thing.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.247
Ness?

20:16.249 --> 20:18.150
Ness, come in. Where are you?

20:19.986 --> 20:22.255
Libby, I've just arrived.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.527
I won't be long.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.230
I'm just doing a recce
while the others are asleep.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.332
Are you stupid?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.902
You've gone out there alone.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.706
I'm not going far.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.375
I'll be back in an hour.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.478
Just keep an eye out.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.581
Get back here now.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.056
No, not yet.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.225
I've almost arrived.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.062
I'm on my way.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.434
No, no.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.771
I need you to be my
eyes around there.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.441
I'm fine, I'll be back soon.

21:17.176 --> 21:18.242
Right.

21:18.244 --> 21:19.346
Stay on the radio.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.012
What can you see?

21:23.550 --> 21:26.751
Heading east through the
pass towards the mountain.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.588
It's like a wasteland.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.727
Hardly any signs
of wildlife at all.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.264
Wait a minute.

21:40.266 --> 21:41.468
I think I see something.

21:47.039 --> 21:47.840
What is it?

21:59.786 --> 22:00.687
It looks like...

22:01.888 --> 22:04.491
Looks like some sort
of nest or something.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.061
And some sort of egg.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.496
Nest.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.766
Right, get back here now,
we're gonna go as a group.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.504
Ness, are you listening to me?

22:31.117 --> 22:33.520
It is an egg and it's huge.

23:04.684 --> 23:09.689
Ness, are you okay?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.792
I feel faint.

23:16.696 --> 23:17.530
Ness.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.505
Get up, get ready,
we need to go.

23:27.507 --> 23:28.575
Ness is in trouble.

23:30.076 --> 23:30.910
What's wrong?

23:31.811 --> 23:33.243
She's gone out alone.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.615
She's gone through the
pass towards the mountains.

23:37.884 --> 23:40.286
She's found an egg and a nest.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.120
And now I can't
get ahold of her,

23:43.122 --> 23:46.192
so she's either unconscious
or she's been attacked.

23:47.059 --> 23:47.894
An egg.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.430
How can that be?

23:59.939 --> 24:01.205
Okay, I know where
she will have gone.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.743
Come on, we need to
go, we need to go.

24:05.211 --> 24:09.181
Here, take this to be safe
of the radiation levels, hm?

24:10.783 --> 24:13.185
I thought you said
we'd be safe out there.

24:14.386 --> 24:16.086
It's just a precaution.

24:16.088 --> 24:18.991
Ness should have taken it and
she should've known better.

25:02.234 --> 25:04.669
Ness?

25:14.614 --> 25:17.283
Here, take one of these pills.

25:20.252 --> 25:23.020
You don't think we're
safe here, do you?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.989
It's just a precaution.

25:35.101 --> 25:35.902
Ness?

25:36.803 --> 25:37.637
Come on.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.371
Sh, it's okay.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.639
It's Libby.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.141
I'm here with Nicole, okay?

25:44.143 --> 25:45.843
No, no, no, no, slowly.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.747
We're gonna get you
back to base, okay?

25:48.948 --> 25:49.782
It's Libby.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.222
We need to get her up now.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.291
Check that out.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.462
Oh, it's an egg.

26:05.464 --> 26:09.199
Oh, my God.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.368
Get her up, get
her back to base.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.237
We can't just leave it there.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.974
That's the whole
part of the mission.

26:16.475 --> 26:20.144
Oh, my God.

26:20.146 --> 26:20.980
Oh, God.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.154
I'm not gonna leave it, but
we need to get her back safe.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.756
I need to be the one
that handles this.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.490
She's gonna take you back, okay?

26:33.492 --> 26:35.960
I'll get this back in one piece.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.561
Yeah.

27:20.639 --> 27:21.839
Remarkable.

27:23.609 --> 27:25.511
How is this even possible?

27:30.316 --> 27:31.317
See here?

27:32.518 --> 27:34.854
The radiation levels are
well above backgrounds.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.654
What do you mean?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.125
How will it survive here?

27:41.894 --> 27:45.297
The only plausible theory
at this point is that

27:47.633 --> 27:51.568
the cells are regenerating
at a much faster rate

27:51.570 --> 27:52.504
than those dying.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.340
But what does that mean?

27:56.342 --> 27:58.377
What will it look like?

28:00.112 --> 28:02.579
It could be a similar
aging process to us.

28:02.581 --> 28:05.950
As the cells regenerate
they form an imperfect

28:05.952 --> 28:09.655
replica of the original, and
over time these accumulate.

28:10.857 --> 28:14.191
As the regeneration
continues to deform,

28:14.193 --> 28:17.329
it'll evolve into an
entire new species.

28:19.565 --> 28:21.200
One that we've
never seen before.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.402
Even with the egg
present it's impossible

28:25.404 --> 28:29.339
to identify whether it
was laid by reptile,

28:29.341 --> 28:33.710
- bird, even insect.
- Whoa, whoa.

28:33.712 --> 28:34.546
An insect?

28:36.749 --> 28:40.785
I mean, a bird, yeah, I
mean an ostrich is that big,

28:40.787 --> 28:43.990
or a reptile, komodo dragon,
but an insect, really?

28:45.491 --> 28:47.693
Is it even
safe to be around that?

28:48.694 --> 28:49.896
The counter's going mad.

28:51.297 --> 28:54.300
As long as we continue to
take our pills, we're protected.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.567
The radiation exposure time
isn't significant enough

28:57.569 --> 28:59.469
to cause any serious harm.

28:59.471 --> 29:01.005
So, come on.

29:01.007 --> 29:03.309
Why have we been sent on a
mission to retrieve this?

29:04.476 --> 29:06.245
Can't you see
the applications?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.214
No, like what?

29:10.216 --> 29:12.349
Well, cancer, for one.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.651
If we can figure out
how to protect people

29:14.653 --> 29:18.991
from radiation exposure,
then this is ground breaking.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.997
The biggest discovery
of the last century.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.801
There's been no wildlife
in this area for years.

29:29.936 --> 29:32.970
How this creature has
evolved to survive

29:32.972 --> 29:35.407
this climate is breathtaking.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.811
And where did you find it?

29:40.212 --> 29:44.116
Just up on the mountains
by a pass headed east.

29:45.751 --> 29:48.085
Is there anything else around?

29:48.087 --> 29:49.319
Not that I could see of.

29:49.321 --> 29:50.787
I mean, it just looked
as though something

29:50.789 --> 29:52.091
had just left it there.

29:53.559 --> 29:58.197
But surely whatever left it
there would go back to get it.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.902
You said there was a nest?

30:04.336 --> 30:06.772
Yeah, I don't know, I mean...

30:08.140 --> 30:09.041
It makes no sense.

30:27.860 --> 30:32.198
Whatever they're looking
for, I think we found it.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.501
I really really need
to speak to Peter.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.639
Is everything good
between you both?

30:44.810 --> 30:45.978
To be honest, Lex, no.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.450
I think he resents the
decision to keep Milly.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.185
And I get it.

30:55.587 --> 30:58.124
I should've made sure that
I'd taken more time off.

30:59.325 --> 31:01.127
Been around more for
the both of them.

31:04.796 --> 31:07.064
You know, I think after
this you really should

31:07.066 --> 31:08.933
take some time off.

31:08.935 --> 31:09.768
You need it.

31:11.470 --> 31:13.203
We all need it.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.006
Yeah.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.775
Do you think that's it, then?

31:18.777 --> 31:19.843
We can go home?

31:21.347 --> 31:24.348
I hope so, 'cause I don't
wanna be here any longer.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.882
No.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.220
We just need Ness to
report the findings and,

31:29.288 --> 31:31.688
I don't know, hopefully
they'll decide

31:31.690 --> 31:33.223
that the egg's enough.

31:33.225 --> 31:35.928
But until then, you
keep away from it, Lex.

31:37.096 --> 31:38.628
I think that Stuart
guy's underestimating

31:38.630 --> 31:40.497
how dangerous it really is.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.932
Okay.

31:41.934 --> 31:42.768
Got that?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.308
Do you want one?

31:50.176 --> 31:51.841
Libby?

31:52.678 --> 31:54.646
I'm all right, thanks.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.049
Okay.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.328
You all right?

32:11.330 --> 32:13.363
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:13.365 --> 32:14.298
How are you?

32:14.300 --> 32:15.601
Yeah, much better, thank you.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.137
Hey, I've been thinking.

32:19.471 --> 32:22.008
Why did you go up to the
mountains on your own like that?

32:23.175 --> 32:26.943
I thought it was the
three of us going.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.413
Well, I just thought
it was a simple thing.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.582
Which it was, but I
should've been more careful.

32:32.584 --> 32:34.351
Been more cautious
on the mountains,

32:34.353 --> 32:36.186
but my temperature's fine.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.687
It's all good.

32:37.689 --> 32:40.126
You do know that me and
Libby are here for a reason.

32:41.493 --> 32:43.695
You don't have to put
yourself at risk like that.

32:44.863 --> 32:46.865
I didn't think I was
putting myself at risk.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.235
Look, um...

32:51.237 --> 32:52.971
What happened before?

32:55.041 --> 32:55.907
I don't blame you.

32:58.544 --> 33:00.246
You know that, right?

33:02.781 --> 33:03.782
Thank you.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.285
Well, I'm going up.

33:58.170 --> 34:00.737
Sorry, the signal
is really bad.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.940
I tried to call you earlier
but I couldn't get through.

34:03.942 --> 34:04.776
Peter.

34:07.813 --> 34:08.780
Peter, listen.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.616
I'm going to be coming
back soon, all right?

34:14.686 --> 34:17.223
Things are going to be
different this time, I promise.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.491
I'm going to make a point
of being around more

34:21.493 --> 34:22.393
for you and Milly.

34:24.196 --> 34:25.030
Okay?

34:29.268 --> 34:30.101
Peter?

34:32.904 --> 34:34.239
Peter, did you hear me?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.216
Are you okay?

36:26.218 --> 36:27.519
Yeah, it's just a cough.

36:29.154 --> 36:29.988
What's going on?

36:32.558 --> 36:34.591
I'm not sure.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.360
Ness.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.260
You shouldn't go
to close too it.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.096
I'm fine.

37:46.298 --> 37:47.499
Just in case.

37:50.001 --> 37:52.436
The counter, it was going
crazy when it was near it,

37:52.438 --> 37:54.706
and your body is
still recovering.

38:01.046 --> 38:03.179
You all heard that, too, right?

38:03.181 --> 38:04.881
Yeah.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.718
Well, whatever
it was, it got out.

38:13.592 --> 38:15.058
Where is it?

38:15.060 --> 38:16.495
Inside the house or...

38:19.030 --> 38:22.566
Yeah, I left
it open to air the room.

38:22.568 --> 38:23.967
There was a musty
smell from the egg

38:23.969 --> 38:25.471
when it was left in here.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.475
Great move.

38:30.409 --> 38:31.541
And now it's gone.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.611
Don't patronize me.

38:34.012 --> 38:36.181
You may have cost us
far more than you realize.

38:37.583 --> 38:40.784
This shell, egg, it
should be enough evidence.

38:40.786 --> 38:42.153
It's not sufficient.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.624
We need the entire body,
like the captain said.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.559
Dead or alive.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.098
How were we to know that it
was gonna hatch and escape?

38:54.265 --> 38:55.565
We don't know what
we're dealing with here,

38:55.567 --> 38:57.669
we barely know where we are.

39:00.639 --> 39:01.440
We track it.

39:02.874 --> 39:07.546
Tonight we get out there, we
find it, and we bring it back.

39:08.414 --> 39:09.646
That thing is far too valuable

39:09.648 --> 39:11.383
to miss an
opportunity like this.

39:12.418 --> 39:13.717
Get your things together.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.621
I'll be down in an hour.

39:31.403 --> 39:32.836
Are you all right?

39:32.838 --> 39:34.337
Yeah.

39:34.339 --> 39:37.441
I think I've just got a
bit of a bug or something.

39:37.443 --> 39:38.276
Are you sure?

39:39.110 --> 39:39.945
Yeah.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.111
What time is it?

39:42.113 --> 39:43.949
It's just after three.

39:45.316 --> 39:46.616
I'm sorry.

39:46.618 --> 39:48.454
It's okay, you
don't look too well.

39:49.555 --> 39:51.187
Why don't, you
know, go back to bed

39:51.189 --> 39:52.522
or something just for a bit.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.323
No, honestly, I'm fine.

39:54.325 --> 39:56.428
Just give me a few
minutes, please.

39:58.129 --> 40:01.498
I'm just gonna go
call the captain,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.299
update him on the situation.

40:03.301 --> 40:04.302
I'll be down soon.

40:07.205 --> 40:08.206
All right.

40:27.726 --> 40:29.025
Hey.

40:29.027 --> 40:30.028
Come check this out.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.632
Not your typical animal, huh?

40:36.935 --> 40:40.203
I've never heard
anything like it.

40:40.205 --> 40:42.371
Was it that thing?

40:42.373 --> 40:44.610
No, it's too loud.

40:46.077 --> 40:48.980
Whatever came out of that egg
couldn't of made that sound.

40:52.484 --> 40:54.951
You think there are more here?

40:56.488 --> 40:59.357
I think its parent wanted it
back after it heard its cry.

41:22.781 --> 41:23.615
What's wrong?

41:24.516 --> 41:25.751
I don't know.

41:27.418 --> 41:31.256
I didn't think anybody
else had been out here.

41:32.858 --> 41:36.828
Sergeant, I need
you to track that thing down.

41:37.696 --> 41:42.065
As I said, dead or alive.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.836
We need to know more
about what that thing is.

41:46.337 --> 41:49.074
I don't feel comfortable
going out there now, sir.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.042
You knew the
times when we were sent out.

41:53.044 --> 41:55.344
Is there a reason you can't
complete the mission now?

41:55.346 --> 41:56.646
Yes.

41:56.648 --> 41:58.414
One of my team is sick.

41:58.416 --> 42:01.785
I think we should stay put and
wait until she feels better.

42:01.787 --> 42:03.555
No, you don't
stop because of me.

42:05.624 --> 42:06.457
Hello, sir.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.627
It's Libby Makenna.

42:09.928 --> 42:12.898
Listen, it's nothing serious.

42:14.465 --> 42:15.767
We continue with the plan.

42:17.736 --> 42:19.135
What would you like us to do?

42:19.137 --> 42:20.704
Libby, stop.

42:20.706 --> 42:25.543
We came here for a reason
and we see it through.

42:26.912 --> 42:29.012
No, they're right.

42:29.014 --> 42:31.149
This could be the
discovery of a lifetime.

42:32.784 --> 42:36.753
I'll be damned if anyone stops
this, especially for my sake.

42:36.755 --> 42:39.322
But you can't go
out there like this.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.158
It's a flu.

42:41.693 --> 42:42.527
It's a flu.

42:43.929 --> 42:45.997
I'd tell you if it were anything
more than that, wouldn't I?

42:50.769 --> 42:55.639
Sir, tell us what
you want us to do.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.517
We have two hours
left before sunrise.

43:08.186 --> 43:10.720
Well, whatever it is,
it seems to be nocturnal.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.590
It could've gone
into hiding by then.

44:21.126 --> 44:22.027
What is it?

44:25.463 --> 44:26.531
I'm not sure.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.236
The Geiger counter, it's
pretty fierce around here.

44:32.971 --> 44:34.105
Should we be worried?

44:35.907 --> 44:36.908
Come on, let's go.

44:41.780 --> 44:45.717
I'm just becoming a
logistics officer now, then.

44:49.420 --> 44:52.590
You are a valued
member of the team,

44:54.059 --> 44:57.228
regardless of what anyone
labels your job title as.

44:58.429 --> 44:59.996
Do you feel sorry
for me or something?

45:01.833 --> 45:03.802
That's not it, Lex.

45:05.603 --> 45:08.874
I wanna be asked to join
a job because I'm valued

45:10.141 --> 45:11.374
and I'm needed on it.

45:11.376 --> 45:12.876
And you are needed.

45:12.878 --> 45:15.146
Well it sure as
hell doesn't feel like it.

45:17.949 --> 45:22.954
I am sorry for what
happened to you, I am.

45:25.590 --> 45:27.225
I accepted that job.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.026
I knew the risks.

45:31.562 --> 45:32.397
But you didn't.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.400
You didn't know the risks.

45:36.968 --> 45:37.936
None of us did.

45:39.337 --> 45:41.938
When we were stationed
out there, none of us knew

45:41.940 --> 45:43.741
what we were getting
ourselves into.

45:45.944 --> 45:48.814
Not Chris or any of the others.

45:51.616 --> 45:53.384
We always know of the risks.

45:55.186 --> 45:56.021
They knew.

45:58.023 --> 46:01.059
They didn't die in vain,
just like what happened to me

46:02.727 --> 46:04.162
wasn't in vain.

46:08.800 --> 46:10.101
Can you check in on Libby?

46:11.569 --> 46:13.839
She doesn't look too good
and she won't talk to me.

46:16.641 --> 46:17.475
Yeah.

46:19.945 --> 46:20.778
Yeah.

46:23.714 --> 46:24.549
Libby?

46:27.018 --> 46:29.921
Hey.

46:32.423 --> 46:33.324
Hey, Libby.

46:36.627 --> 46:41.632
What's going on?

46:52.810 --> 46:55.611
Why haven't you
been taking these?

46:59.550 --> 47:00.351
Hey, hey.

47:02.087 --> 47:02.921
It's okay.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.056
Libby.

47:06.424 --> 47:07.492
What's wrong?

47:08.693 --> 47:10.028
I can hear it.

47:12.197 --> 47:13.596
In here.

47:13.598 --> 47:15.999
What?
What can you hear?

47:16.001 --> 47:17.835
It's calling for me.

47:19.004 --> 47:22.005
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

47:22.007 --> 47:26.209
No, what do you mean
it's calling for you?

47:26.211 --> 47:30.213
Whatever is out there.

47:30.215 --> 47:32.217
Could you not hear this?

47:34.119 --> 47:36.621
Can you hear it calling now?

47:42.393 --> 47:45.094
How can you not hear this?

47:45.096 --> 47:46.395
Libby, look at me, look at me.

47:46.397 --> 47:47.332
Look, look.

47:48.366 --> 47:49.867
Libby, look at me.

47:51.002 --> 47:54.803
Whatever is going on
in here, it's not real.

47:57.909 --> 48:01.079
It's out there,
it's out there.

48:02.313 --> 48:05.681
- It's waiting for us.
- Come here.

48:05.683 --> 48:06.517
It's okay.

48:07.718 --> 48:08.551
It's okay.

48:40.952 --> 48:43.421
I don't think it's
safe for us to be here.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.627
It's almost sunrise,
we can head back then.

48:52.163 --> 48:54.232
No, we need to go back now.

48:58.503 --> 49:00.236
Can anyone read me?

49:00.238 --> 49:01.006
Hello?

49:22.793 --> 49:23.794
What was that?

49:26.831 --> 49:28.133
Can anyone hear me? Hello?

49:30.501 --> 49:31.469
Can anyone read me?

49:32.470 --> 49:33.304
Hello?

49:36.707 --> 49:38.341
This is Lexy.

49:38.343 --> 49:40.411
Come in.

49:48.086 --> 49:50.453
Stuart, we need to head back.

49:50.455 --> 49:51.756
It doesn't feel safe here.

50:41.306 --> 50:42.771
Anything?

50:42.773 --> 50:44.209
Nope, nothing yet.

50:45.410 --> 50:46.742
I think they tried to
make connection earlier

50:46.744 --> 50:49.345
but it didn't connect.

50:49.347 --> 50:54.319
Well, the minute they
get back, we need to leave.

50:56.554 --> 51:00.189
We get Libby in the car
and we get away from here

51:00.191 --> 51:02.358
and then we can call for help.

51:02.360 --> 51:03.792
What is it?

51:03.794 --> 51:04.629
Is she okay?

51:05.830 --> 51:07.263
There's something
very wrong with her.

51:07.265 --> 51:09.198
She's uh...

51:09.200 --> 51:11.936
She said she hears
voices in her head.

51:14.071 --> 51:15.573
We can't leave her any longer.

51:16.941 --> 51:17.873
I mean, we need to get her seen

51:17.875 --> 51:19.808
by a professional or something.

51:19.810 --> 51:22.044
Do you think it
was the radiation?

51:22.046 --> 51:25.516
Maybe she was, I dunno,
exposed to it for too long.

51:26.617 --> 51:28.083
Possibly.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.119
I mean, she hasn't
been taking the pills.

51:30.121 --> 51:32.455
She's always so untrusting.

51:32.457 --> 51:33.524
She needs help.

51:34.792 --> 51:38.026
Come in.

51:38.028 --> 51:39.029
Can anyone hear me?

51:40.231 --> 51:42.731
Stuart, it's Lexy here.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.867
Is everything okay out there?

51:44.869 --> 51:46.871
Something
is out here with us.

51:48.306 --> 51:51.576
I'm heading back to
base, I'm nearly there.

51:59.884 --> 52:01.051
What is that?

52:19.670 --> 52:21.837
We've gotta get out of here.

52:21.839 --> 52:22.673
Now.

52:39.790 --> 52:41.790
No!

53:29.407 --> 53:30.673
I'm coming.

53:30.675 --> 53:31.776
Almost there.

53:33.778 --> 53:37.079
Ness!

53:37.081 --> 53:38.881
Go, quickly!

53:38.883 --> 53:39.950
Hurry up, go.

53:41.051 --> 53:44.587
Shut it.

53:47.458 --> 53:48.726
Where's Nicole?

54:00.070 --> 54:01.372
Where did it attack you?

54:02.873 --> 54:05.207
Up in the mountains.

54:05.209 --> 54:07.512
We were close to where
the eggs were found and

54:09.246 --> 54:11.816
Nicole said we only had a
little bit further to go.

54:15.386 --> 54:16.421
And then we heard it.

54:19.223 --> 54:21.657
Before long it honed in on us.

54:21.659 --> 54:24.026
Do you think it
followed you up there

54:24.028 --> 54:27.698
or could you have wandered
into its nesting area?

54:29.734 --> 54:30.699
I'm not sure.

54:30.701 --> 54:32.002
Well try and be sure!

54:33.404 --> 54:35.037
Because if it followed
you up there then

54:35.039 --> 54:38.541
it knows you are here, and
after we took that thing's egg

54:38.543 --> 54:40.144
it probably sees us as a threat.

54:42.413 --> 54:43.781
We were close to the eggs.

54:45.916 --> 54:48.384
We must've done
something to disturb it.

54:48.386 --> 54:50.020
Christ, it followed
me back here.

54:53.324 --> 54:54.291
It's out there now.

54:57.328 --> 54:59.029
Waiting for me to
go back outside.

54:59.997 --> 55:00.931
What about Nicole?

55:04.101 --> 55:05.002
It attacked her.

55:07.204 --> 55:09.972
Is there any chance that
she could still be alive?

55:09.974 --> 55:10.808
No.

55:12.209 --> 55:14.679
Do you have any idea what
we're dealing with here?

55:16.347 --> 55:18.282
A cross between a vulture

55:23.588 --> 55:24.422
and a bat.

55:27.925 --> 55:28.759
A dragon.

55:30.194 --> 55:34.296
It was like the
sketches, the sightings.

55:34.298 --> 55:36.131
You think that
there's a dragon

55:36.133 --> 55:37.768
living out in those mountains.

55:38.803 --> 55:40.636
And now it knows we're here.

55:40.638 --> 55:42.272
And it's angry.

55:43.841 --> 55:45.240
Are you crazy?

55:45.242 --> 55:46.642
Listen to yourselves!

55:46.644 --> 55:49.044
It's not a dragon, all right?

55:49.046 --> 55:51.346
It is not a dragon.

55:51.348 --> 55:56.018
It's, I don't know, some
kind of bird that's mutated

55:56.020 --> 55:57.788
because of the radiation levels.

55:58.789 --> 55:59.622
This isn't any bird, Ness.

55:59.624 --> 56:00.858
You weren't there.

56:04.128 --> 56:05.062
The size of it...

56:07.064 --> 56:07.898
The skin...

56:10.100 --> 56:14.672
What we are hunting is far
more dangerous than I imagined.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.145
So much for leaving.

56:24.014 --> 56:27.785
Right, well, we're
gonna have to lay low,

56:29.353 --> 56:34.358
bide our time and hope that
it doesn't see us as a threat,

56:35.526 --> 56:37.159
leaves us alone.

56:37.161 --> 56:40.297
This isn't some stupid
creature, Ness, it's intelligent.

56:42.767 --> 56:45.803
We took its offspring,
for Christ sake.

56:50.240 --> 56:52.074
It could linger
outside for days.

56:52.076 --> 56:54.111
It could get in
here and kill us.

56:57.414 --> 56:59.416
It's like any animal
with instinct.

57:02.019 --> 57:04.054
It wants to kill any
potential predator.

57:05.956 --> 57:08.125
Do you think that
there are more of them?

57:09.560 --> 57:11.095
I think there might be.

57:21.706 --> 57:23.371
What's happened to the power?

57:23.373 --> 57:25.908
It's once you got back.

57:25.910 --> 57:28.178
Everything went out and
now it's fluctuating.

57:30.681 --> 57:31.516
Right.

57:33.350 --> 57:35.920
Which means the
landline's down.

57:38.422 --> 57:40.525
Dear, we've got no
means of communication.

57:43.528 --> 57:46.294
You still got your car
outside though, right?

57:46.296 --> 57:47.129
Yeah, why?

57:47.131 --> 57:47.965
What're you thinking?

57:49.600 --> 57:50.833
Nicole had her keys with her,

57:50.835 --> 57:53.671
but you could get
us out of here.

57:54.905 --> 57:56.204
We tell the officials
what happened,

57:56.206 --> 57:59.608
get backup sent to
put that thing down.

57:59.610 --> 58:01.677
Yeah, but what if
there is more than one?

58:01.679 --> 58:02.911
We don't know
what's out there,

58:02.913 --> 58:05.848
but whatever it is,

58:05.850 --> 58:08.150
they wanted us to find
out for some reason.

58:08.152 --> 58:10.385
Libby, can you get dressed?

58:10.387 --> 58:11.987
You're okay?

58:11.989 --> 58:13.522
I think so.

58:13.524 --> 58:18.093
- God, I think so.
- Okay.

58:18.095 --> 58:21.897
It feels like something
is inside of me.

58:24.201 --> 58:26.470
Please, I'm not normal.

58:29.473 --> 58:32.007
It won't stop.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.809
In my head.

58:33.811 --> 58:34.979
It won't stop.

58:36.046 --> 58:37.212
Libby, you're okay.

58:37.214 --> 58:38.714
You're okay, I promise.

58:38.716 --> 58:39.915
I'm here.

58:42.820 --> 58:43.988
It'll be okay.

58:47.558 --> 58:50.425
There is no way that
thing is going to just leave

58:50.427 --> 58:51.528
of its own accord.

58:53.497 --> 58:54.699
You know, it's clever,

58:56.834 --> 58:58.736
but we do have one
way of detecting it.

59:00.771 --> 59:03.107
We know that when it
comes within 100 foot that

59:04.508 --> 59:07.945
it distorts signals
and electronic devices.

59:10.180 --> 59:15.185
Within 25 foot the Geiger
counter fluctuates rapidly.

59:16.887 --> 59:21.892
Which means right
now it's circling.

59:27.865 --> 59:28.999
Ness, we're trapped.

59:34.471 --> 59:36.271
How's she doing?

59:36.273 --> 59:38.006
There's no change.

59:38.008 --> 59:40.042
She's still delirious.

59:40.044 --> 59:41.944
All right, well, we
can't wait any longer,

59:41.946 --> 59:42.980
we need to get going.

59:44.782 --> 59:46.849
I'm gonna try and
call the captain again

59:46.851 --> 59:49.551
and see if he can
send any assistance.

59:49.553 --> 59:50.786
Agreed.

59:50.788 --> 59:52.721
We can't risk Libby
getting any worse.

59:52.723 --> 59:53.824
Right, come with me.

59:56.493 --> 59:58.528
We need to take our
chances and leave.

59:59.697 --> 01:00:01.131
With that thing
waiting outside?

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:04.366
We are isolated.

01:00:04.368 --> 01:00:06.536
We've got no means
of communication.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.604
Libby is getting
worse, so are we.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.440
We're getting
weaker by the hour.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.946
Ness, the second we go
outside that thing kills us.

01:00:17.381 --> 01:00:19.047
I hardly think that's the
best strategy for survival.

01:00:19.049 --> 01:00:19.884
No, it's not.

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:21.850
He's right.

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:26.354
All four of us going out
there would be suicide.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.626
Has anybody got
any better ideas?

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:33.764
We need to distract it.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:35.800
- She's right.
- Yeah.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.636
It can't keep tabs on
all corners of the house.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.705
One of us needs to get out there

01:00:42.707 --> 01:00:44.274
far enough to call for help.

01:00:46.143 --> 01:00:47.575
Well, let's do it.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.245
No, not yet.

01:00:50.247 --> 01:00:52.848
We need to put it
to the test first.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.983
We need to be absolutely
certain that that thing

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.985
is out there waiting for us.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:57.920
All right.

01:00:57.922 --> 01:00:59.121
Let's use one of these.

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:01.926
We light it, throw it outside,

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:04.261
and see how it reacts.

01:01:05.796 --> 01:01:08.063
Sounds like our
safest option so far.

01:01:08.065 --> 01:01:10.365
I'm gonna go and
assess Libby's condition.

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:11.201
Sure.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:37.762
Hey, Libby.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:39.928
Hey, you, hey.

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:42.030
Hey, we're all getting ready.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:43.031
Do you think you can do that?

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:43.968
Can you get ready?

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:45.903
It's gone.

01:01:48.272 --> 01:01:49.673
The noise, it stopped.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:52.242
What do you mean?

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:56.211
Whatever I was hearing,
it got worse when

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.447
that thing was nearby.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:03.120
I can't hear it now, so that
must mean the thing's gone.

01:02:04.989 --> 01:02:09.124
Okay, Libby, I think you're
getting radiation sickness.

01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:11.126
You need to take your pills.

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:13.395
Be careful from now on, okay?

01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:14.997
We've got a plan.

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:17.065
We're gonna get
out of here soon.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:19.503
Just get dressed
and take the pills.

01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:21.839
Okay, see you soon.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:36.218
How was she?

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.953
Oh, God, I don't know.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:39.221
All right.

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:40.722
Well, the visibility's
better from in there,

01:02:40.724 --> 01:02:45.327
so on the count of three
I'm gonna throw this out.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:49.099
I need you two to keep
your eyes on the flare.

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.868
See if you can spot it.

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:53.836
Okay.

01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:55.270
I'll be by the lounge window.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:57.139
And I'll be by the side.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:59.174
We've only got
one shot at this.

01:02:59.176 --> 01:03:03.814
So be vigilant, we need to
know if it's still waiting.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.048
Are you set?

01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:07.582
Yeah, I'm on it.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:08.418
Ready.

01:03:09.954 --> 01:03:10.787
Let's do it.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:01.838
Three.

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.241
Two.

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:06.944
One.

01:05:06.036 --> 01:05:06.870
Anything?

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:12.842
Nothing yet.

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.101
It's there.

01:05:46.076 --> 01:05:47.011
It was waiting.

01:05:49.879 --> 01:05:50.981
Like a vulture.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:34.658
It's clever.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:39.961
It was waiting for
us to go outside.

01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:43.031
What are we gonna do now?

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:45.535
There's no way we're
gonna be able to outrun it.

01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:49.137
There's a chance we
can't even kill it,

01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:51.073
guns are gonna be
useless against it.

01:06:51.075 --> 01:06:52.576
What about Libby?

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:56.244
There's no way that
was just the flu.

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.612
I agree.

01:06:57.614 --> 01:07:00.050
I don't even think it
was radiation sickness.

01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:06.690
We have to get out of here.

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:11.628
This isn't a dumb animal, it
excels at hunting trapped prey.

01:07:13.897 --> 01:07:15.597
We have to leave.

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.099
He's right.

01:07:17.101 --> 01:07:19.603
It's only a matter of time
before that thing breaks in.

01:07:21.605 --> 01:07:25.006
Listen, if I can
make it to your car,

01:07:25.008 --> 01:07:26.774
I can drive until
I get a signal.

01:07:26.776 --> 01:07:28.276
Ness!

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:32.580
If it follows me, you'll
get reception back here.

01:07:32.582 --> 01:07:35.150
It can't be in two
places at the same time.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:36.951
Absolutely not.

01:07:36.953 --> 01:07:38.653
I'm going.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:41.558
I need you to be the
distraction, to grab its attention.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:44.828
You're much more adept
with a firearm than I am.

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:49.864
Yeah.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.205
If you can give me the
go ahead when to run,

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:00.475
you can be at the window
to tell me when it's safe.

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:01.278
Sure.

01:08:05.115 --> 01:08:05.949
Yeah.

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:28.037
Three.

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.242
Two.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:36.446
One.

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:42.350
It's here.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:43.187
Clear.

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:46.656
Ready when you are.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:15.316
Stuart, please come
back inside this house.

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.233
Extraordinary.

01:09:43.246 --> 01:09:44.080
No, no!

01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:47.716
Why did he stop like that?

01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:51.919
Damn it!

01:10:00.730 --> 01:10:01.630
What's going on?

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.102
Where's Stuart and Nicole?

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:08.636
They're gone, Libby.

01:10:08.638 --> 01:10:10.204
We're alone.

01:10:10.206 --> 01:10:11.806
It knew!

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:14.441
It knew we were
trying to trick it.

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:15.279
Oh, shit.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.884
Wait, the Geiger counter's
showing a low reading.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:23.950
Ness, try the phone line
now, you may be able

01:10:23.952 --> 01:10:25.887
to get through to the captain.

01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:28.856
It's ringing!

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:29.693
Go, go!

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:41.803
Hello?

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:43.671
We're aware of the situation.

01:10:43.673 --> 01:10:47.277
Stay put, someone has been
dispatched to rescue you.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:51.413
Captain, this thing is not
at all what we thought it was.

01:10:51.415 --> 01:10:54.751
It's killed two people already,
we need your help please.

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:57.585
Where
exactly are you?

01:10:57.587 --> 01:11:00.355
In the house,
hallway, front door.

01:11:00.357 --> 01:11:02.690
Okay,
go to the back door.

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:04.892
Someone should be there
to assist you soon.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:06.260
Tell the other two
to keep an eye on

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:07.664
that creature and stay safe.

01:11:10.534 --> 01:11:11.798
You need to go.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:13.868
Make sure all the doors
and windows are locked.

01:11:13.870 --> 01:11:15.136
Okay.

01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:15.803
I'm gonna keep an
eye out for backup.

01:11:15.805 --> 01:11:16.773
Okay.

01:11:57.581 --> 01:11:59.080
There you are.

01:11:59.082 --> 01:11:59.983
Don't move.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:03.019
Lower your weapon.

01:12:05.489 --> 01:12:06.856
What's going on, Captain?

01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:11.193
I won't patronize you any
more than I already have.

01:12:15.098 --> 01:12:16.199
What'd you make of it?

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.068
Make of what?

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:23.373
That creature?

01:12:25.308 --> 01:12:26.142
Yes.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:29.978
The monster.

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.016
Isn't it amazing?

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:40.123
A new military weapon capable
of killing from any distance.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:43.393
You made that thing?

01:12:44.227 --> 01:12:45.061
Yes.

01:12:46.228 --> 01:12:48.832
They are the ultimate predator.

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.635
Our greatest weapon.

01:12:52.802 --> 01:12:53.603
They?

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:57.171
You mean there's more than one?

01:12:57.173 --> 01:12:58.606
Hundreds.

01:13:05.949 --> 01:13:07.050
Why are we here?

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:12.422
You see, eventually,
there comes a point

01:13:13.823 --> 01:13:16.791
when a weapon needs to be
tried and tested in the field.

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:21.030
It can't just be theory.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:26.302
And we are the test.

01:13:30.373 --> 01:13:34.708
We needed to know if
it was truly capable

01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:38.378
of beating a trained
squadron like yourselves.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.747
We needed fodder.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.317
And what about the other two?

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.353
To call on your moral
duty, to protect and serve.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.563
What happens when
all this is over, hm?

01:13:55.565 --> 01:13:57.632
We just leave?

01:13:57.634 --> 01:13:58.434
Over?

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:00.969
It's far from over.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.239
We need to see it in the wild,

01:14:05.241 --> 01:14:08.478
not hunting a
mouse under a rock.

01:14:10.346 --> 01:14:12.648
And why would we do that?

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.754
You have a four
minute handicap.

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:23.392
If you stay, you die.

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:26.262
If you leave, well...

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:30.765
You have a chance to live.

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:31.601
Now...

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.941
Now, walk on to that front door.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:44.110
Upon hearing the
sound of my whistle,

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:47.684
you will have precisely
three minutes of safety.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:57.759
No time to explain,
we need to go.

01:14:57.761 --> 01:14:58.592
- Come on.
- What?

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.061
Where is the captain?

01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.697
It was a set up, that
thing is a military machine.

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.899
He's gonna blow the whistle and
then we've got three minutes

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:06.967
to get out before
being attacked.

01:15:06.969 --> 01:15:09.604
Shit.

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:11.372
The back exit, quick, upstairs!

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:12.306
Upstairs!

01:15:12.308 --> 01:15:14.544
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:15:21.585 --> 01:15:22.416
Okay.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:24.151
Right, get to the car!

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:28.289
Go, go, go, go.

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:35.498
Quick.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.099
We don't have the keys.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.803
We can hotwire it.

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:47.443
Stuart.

01:15:48.778 --> 01:15:51.646
He shot them, the
tires, he's a bastard!

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:55.282
Get to the woods.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:58.052
The creature can't fly through
the trees, it's too dense.

01:15:58.054 --> 01:15:59.654
Yeah, okay.

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:04.659
Come on.

01:16:04.661 --> 01:16:05.494
Run.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.165
Libby here, over here.

01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:12.434
- Keep going.
- Ow!

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.101
I can't!

01:16:31.721 --> 01:16:34.157
- I can't.
- You need to get up.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.992
Lex, come on, come on.

01:16:37.994 --> 01:16:39.860
Ness, I'm slowing you down.

01:16:39.862 --> 01:16:42.529
You need to get up, please.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.032
I'm slowing you down.

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:49.203
No.

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:50.039
Keep on.

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:52.508
Look at me.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:55.643
I'm not leaving you.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:58.145
I am not leaving you.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:16:59.348
You need to go.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.482
Please.

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:03.050
Get out of here, Ness.

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:04.285
Libby, you can go.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:05.419
- You are.
- I'm not leaving you.

01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:07.323
You are, you have to.

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:10.326
No.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.660
She's right.

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:13.496
What?

01:17:18.434 --> 01:17:19.268
What?

01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:21.938
Ness, we...

01:17:23.106 --> 01:17:24.007
We have no choice.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.009
No, no, no.

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:29.210
I'm not leaving her.

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:31.246
I am not leaving her.

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.785
I can't, Ness.

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:42.389
I can't.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:47.396
I don't blame either one of
you for what happened to me.

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.766
You know that, right?

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:01.408
Go! Just get out of here!

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:03.947
Just please, just go.

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:07.383
- Come on.
- Go!

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:10.219
Come on!

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:12.720
Just go!

01:18:14.991 --> 01:18:15.825
Go, Ness!

01:19:11.014 --> 01:19:12.780
- Let's go!
- No!

01:19:12.782 --> 01:19:14.681
Libby, come on,
we've gotta go!

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.083
We've gotta go!

01:19:45.748 --> 01:19:48.782
She didn't do that
so we could stay here.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.286
Stay here and die.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:53.720
Ness, come on.

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:07.236
Libby.

01:20:12.942 --> 01:20:14.110
Libby, get up.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.412
Come on, come on,
we've gotta go.

01:20:18.414 --> 01:20:19.748
We've got to go!

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:35.630
Run!

01:20:59.889 --> 01:21:00.623
Hold it.

01:21:04.493 --> 01:21:05.561
Drop your weapon.

01:21:13.236 --> 01:21:14.403
On your knees.

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:27.951
Where are the girls?

01:21:31.554 --> 01:21:32.519
I'm so sorry.

01:21:32.521 --> 01:21:34.088
I'm sorry.

01:21:34.090 --> 01:21:35.124
I'm sorry, I am.

01:21:36.259 --> 01:21:37.559
How could you do this?

01:21:40.463 --> 01:21:42.031
Hold it, hold it right there.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:21:58.545
Here it comes.

01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.202
Meet our newest upgrade.

01:22:25.008 --> 01:22:27.175
The old ones, they
were intelligent,

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:34.617
but inefficient, unnecessarily
cruel and just malicious.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.154
This one, however...

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.392
Top of the reigns.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:00.609
Ness.
