[sighs]

00:34.277 --> 00:35.444
[Mickey] Fuck!

00:39.782 --> 00:41.241
Oh, shit!

00:44.370 --> 00:45.913
[scrubbing]

00:48.374 --> 00:49.583
Hey!

00:49.667 --> 00:50.709
- Hi. Oh, no...
- Hi.

00:50.793 --> 00:52.085
- Don't step there.
- Oh, shit.

00:52.169 --> 00:53.809
- [Mickey] I gotta sweep that up.
- Sorry.

00:54.547 --> 00:57.966
Hey, did you notice last night,
there was a point where I was spooning you

00:58.050 --> 01:00.761
[chuckles] and then
you were spooning Grandpa?

01:00.844 --> 01:02.220
It was so cute.

01:02.305 --> 01:03.847
Oh, my God!

01:03.931 --> 01:06.183
Bertie leaves half-eaten
yogurt cups in here.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.027
Who eats half a yogurt
and then puts it back?

01:08.602 --> 01:10.229
She is a small person, so...

01:11.438 --> 01:13.065
Can I help? Why are you cleaning?

01:13.148 --> 01:16.318
Oh, well, my dad's coming to town,
so I figured I'd clean.

01:16.402 --> 01:17.778
Your dad? Really?

01:18.612 --> 01:21.532
Marty Dobbs, flying in from Jersey
as we speak.

01:22.366 --> 01:24.284
Wow. I had no idea.

01:24.368 --> 01:25.968
Well, he didn't tell me until yesterday.

01:25.994 --> 01:27.663
My dad's Mr. Casual.

01:27.746 --> 01:30.666
But it's cool.
It'll be good to see him, I think.

01:31.875 --> 01:35.671
That's cool.
I'm sure you guys will have a fun time.

01:35.754 --> 01:37.005
- [Mickey] Hmm.
- Um...

01:37.965 --> 01:40.509
you, uh, guys got any big plans?

01:40.593 --> 01:43.429
[sighs] Well, I was gonna meet him
for lunch near the airport

01:43.512 --> 01:44.555
and bring him back here.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.973
- Hmm.
- You should come with.

01:47.725 --> 01:51.144
Oh! Uh, wow, okay, um...

01:51.228 --> 01:52.730
- It'll be fun!
- [inhales sharply]

01:52.813 --> 01:55.190
Please, please, please.
Free lunch on Marty Dobbs.

01:55.273 --> 01:56.900
What else are you gonna do today, hmm?

01:56.984 --> 01:57.985
I don't know. I just...

01:58.068 --> 02:00.488
I don't wanna intrude on time
with your dad and...

02:01.572 --> 02:04.074
Meeting a dad's kind of a big deal,
don't you think?

02:04.157 --> 02:08.662
Dude, no. It is so not a big deal.
If you meet my mom, that's a big deal.

02:08.746 --> 02:09.872
This will be easy.

02:09.955 --> 02:13.166
My dad's kind of an asshole,
but you'll like him and he'll love you.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.503
I mean,
compared to all the other guys he's met.

02:15.586 --> 02:17.713
The last guy was on cat tranquilizers.

02:17.796 --> 02:19.089
- Those work on humans?
- Yeah.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.008
Same as human ones.
You gotta take a bunch.

02:21.091 --> 02:22.175
[chuckles]

02:24.512 --> 02:26.232
So, what do you say, Cruikshank?
Are you in?

02:26.805 --> 02:28.223
Uh...

02:28.307 --> 02:29.307
okay.

02:29.808 --> 02:30.808
Yes, fine.

02:31.644 --> 02:33.937
Why not?
I'll meet Poppa Dobbs. Sure.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.649
Sweet! I'm gonna take a quick shower,
and we'll hit the road.

02:36.732 --> 02:37.858
Okay. All right.

02:46.867 --> 02:47.868
Oh, hey, Gus.

02:48.452 --> 02:49.745
Bertie. Morning.

02:49.828 --> 02:51.371
Why is everything different?

02:51.455 --> 02:54.625
Oh, uh, Mickey's cleaning up. Yeah.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.251
I guess her dad's visiting.

02:56.335 --> 02:57.169
- He is?
- Yeah.

02:57.252 --> 02:59.630
And, uh, I'm gonna go meet him.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.549
- Oh, wow! For real?
- Mmm-hmm.

03:02.841 --> 03:03.926
You think it's too soon?

03:04.009 --> 03:07.721
Hmm. I don't know.
That's a good question.

03:09.139 --> 03:11.850
- Oh, where'd my yogurt go?
- That's also a good question.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.687
Do you know where it went?

03:15.437 --> 03:16.437
No.

03:19.191 --> 03:20.484
[music playing over radio]

03:20.568 --> 03:23.278
- [Gus] You look nice.
- [Mickey] Glad I showered.

03:23.362 --> 03:24.362
Oh, me too.

03:25.030 --> 03:26.590
It would've been a bad first impression

03:26.657 --> 03:28.909
to meet your dad with me,
like, reeking of sex.

03:28.992 --> 03:30.072
- [Mickey] Hmm.
- [chuckles]

03:30.118 --> 03:33.914
Yeah. That's probably something
dads can smell instinctively anyway.

03:33.997 --> 03:34.998
[chuckling]

03:37.543 --> 03:41.254
Got any, uh, tips on meeting your dad?
Anything I should know going in?

03:41.338 --> 03:45.551
- Mmm, not really.
- Yeah? What's he do for a living?

03:45.634 --> 03:47.595
He used to be a dentist,

03:47.678 --> 03:52.725
before he lost his license for giving out,
uh, prescriptions of pain medications.

03:52.808 --> 03:54.560
Oh. Okay.

03:54.643 --> 03:56.979
Now he's a consultant,
whatever that means.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.314
- Hmm.
- He's always about to make a ton of money

03:59.398 --> 04:02.192
on some amazing idea
that always falls through.

04:02.276 --> 04:05.070
Uh, yeah, yeah.

04:05.153 --> 04:07.490
When's the... when's the last time
you guys saw each other?

04:08.407 --> 04:09.741
Two, three years ago.

04:10.242 --> 04:14.538
Oh. Shit. So this is...
this is kind of a big deal.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.500
I mean, it's not not a big deal,
but it's not a big deal.

04:17.583 --> 04:20.084
Do you two not...
Like, I don't know what...

04:20.168 --> 04:21.545
Do you guys not get along, or...

04:21.629 --> 04:25.508
No, it's not that. I mean, we're just,
you know, both busy people.

04:25.591 --> 04:28.135
I mean, he's my dad,
so it'll always be a little complicated,

04:28.218 --> 04:30.137
but we're not, like,
estranged or anything.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.263
Yeah, yeah.

04:31.889 --> 04:35.768
Well, don't worry,
dads are kind of my specialty.

04:36.685 --> 04:40.814
A lot of times an ex's dad will like me
more than his daughter ever did.

04:40.898 --> 04:42.190
That's fucked up.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.361
Yeah, I realize that's probably
not something I should brag about.

04:46.904 --> 04:50.032
I'm guessing it's more of a turn on
to be the bad boy anyway, right?

04:50.115 --> 04:51.283
Not for me anymore.

04:57.706 --> 05:00.626
Where is he? I mean, his plane landed,
like, an hour ago.

05:00.709 --> 05:04.087
Yeah. Uh, I wouldn't worry about it.

05:04.171 --> 05:06.632
You know, it probably takes a long time
getting off the plane,

05:06.715 --> 05:08.216
and picking up your bags and...

05:08.300 --> 05:10.343
waiting in line for those taxis and stuff.

05:11.219 --> 05:13.681
- [Mickey] That's probably him.
- [Gus] Oh, yup.

05:15.348 --> 05:17.434
- Oh, shit.
- [Marty] Thank you.

05:17.518 --> 05:20.854
- Hey, Dad!
- [chuckles] Hey, kiddo! How are ya?

05:20.938 --> 05:24.107
Aw. Man, you're even skinnier
than the last time I saw you.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.276
[chuckles] Ah, you look
pretty good yourself.

05:26.359 --> 05:28.320
Yeah, I do, don't I? [chuckles]

05:29.947 --> 05:32.115
- Hello! Hi.
- Hey.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.785
Sorry. This is Gus. He's...
Uh, we're dating.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.036
Nice to meet you, Marty.

05:37.454 --> 05:39.539
- [chuckling]
- Sorry, I'm a hugger.

05:39.623 --> 05:40.749
- Gus, huh?
- Yeah.

05:40.833 --> 05:44.461
I only ever knew one other Gus.
Gus Greenwold. Solid guy.

05:44.544 --> 05:46.129
Oh, yeah.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.382
I think I, uh, met him last year
at the, uh, Gus Convention.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.384
He's not alive.

05:51.468 --> 05:54.847
Oh. [chuckles] Um, I'm sorry.

05:54.930 --> 05:57.933
Well, that's okay. I mean, at least
we're all still here, am I right?

05:58.016 --> 05:59.267
- Yeah!
- [both chuckling]

05:59.351 --> 06:01.979
- Hey, can I take those for you?
- Uh, yeah.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.438
Thank you. I mean...

06:04.522 --> 06:05.941
- Eager little guy.
- Yeah.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.986
Isn't this place cool, Dad?
It's Himalayan.

06:09.069 --> 06:11.071
They're supposed to have
the best samosas in LA.

06:11.154 --> 06:14.658
Well, that's a bold statement, Mick.
You know how picky I am about my samosas.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.868
[all chuckling]

06:15.951 --> 06:18.621
So, uh, Marty, how was the flight?

06:18.704 --> 06:20.038
[scoffs] Oh, my God.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.917
They sat me next to a lady
with one of these therapy dogs.

06:24.001 --> 06:26.837
You heard about this?
It's just a bullshit excuse for this lady

06:26.920 --> 06:28.720
- to bring her bichon everywhere.
- [chuckles]

06:28.756 --> 06:31.466
I know. Therapy dogs. It's like, really?

06:31.549 --> 06:33.593
Right after we take off,
we hit a little turbulence.

06:33.677 --> 06:34.762
This dog goes crazy.

06:34.845 --> 06:38.515
Starts barking and whimpering
and immediately takes a dump...

06:38.598 --> 06:39.659
- Oh, my God.
- on the floor.

06:39.683 --> 06:42.560
- No!
- It smells disgusting.

06:42.645 --> 06:43.646
I mean, they clean it up,

06:43.729 --> 06:46.523
but for five full hours,
I am in dog shit hell.

06:46.606 --> 06:48.483
People start looking at me
like it's my dog.

06:48.566 --> 06:49.711
- That's awful!
- And I'm saying,

06:49.735 --> 06:53.155
"Hey," you know, "Do I look like I'm
a fucking bichon owner to you?"

06:53.238 --> 06:54.823
- No. You don't.
- [chuckling]

06:54.907 --> 06:56.627
- You really don't... Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

06:56.700 --> 06:58.702
Mick, you still got that cat?
What's his name?

06:58.786 --> 07:02.372
Grandpa. 'Cause he's the reincarnation
of Grandpa, remember?

07:03.581 --> 07:06.584
Yeah. This is what makes Mickey Mickey.

07:06.669 --> 07:07.670
[Marty and Gus chuckle]

07:11.089 --> 07:15.135
Oh, Dad, um, I got a promotion at work.

07:15.218 --> 07:17.721
I'm a program manager now
at the radio station.

07:17.805 --> 07:21.058
Really?
Hey, congratulations!

07:21.141 --> 07:23.185
Hey, you always were good
at hustling up work.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.603
- Thanks.
- You and me, huh? Both hustlers.

07:26.188 --> 07:28.649
See, there's something good
you inherited from me.

07:28.732 --> 07:29.733
It's in our blood.

07:30.609 --> 07:31.609
Right. Yeah.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.278
[Gus chuckles]

07:33.779 --> 07:36.239
[sighs] So, Gus, what's your last name?

07:36.323 --> 07:38.283
- Cruikshank. Mmm-hmm.
- Cruikshank.

07:38.366 --> 07:41.161
[chuckles] What nationality is that?

07:41.244 --> 07:44.456
Oh, it's, um, Scottish. German.

07:44.539 --> 07:47.835
Uh, you know, I... I gotta say,
I figured that you were maybe, uh...

07:47.918 --> 07:49.795
- What? Jewish?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:49.878 --> 07:51.171
Ah! [chuckling]

07:51.254 --> 07:54.717
Yeah, I get that sometimes.
'Cause of the, uh... [exclaims]

07:54.800 --> 07:56.301
[both laughing]

07:57.052 --> 07:59.471
No, no, I was, uh,
I was actually raised Catholic.

07:59.554 --> 08:01.765
- Well, you had me fooled.
- [chuckles] Good.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.267
Gus was raised in South Dakota
and he teaches kid actors.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.686
No kidding.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.813
Have you ever heard of the show <i>Witchita?</i>

08:07.896 --> 08:09.356
Yeah, the witch show, you bet.

08:09.439 --> 08:11.024
Gus worked on that show.

08:11.108 --> 08:13.986
- And... he wrote a script for them.
- Ah...

08:14.069 --> 08:17.197
- No! Hey, well, that's great!
- [Gus softly] Yeah.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.280
Great.

08:18.991 --> 08:20.701
Good for you, Micks.

08:20.784 --> 08:23.871
Got yourself a nice, hardworking guy
with no tattoos or piercings.

08:23.954 --> 08:25.038
[Mickey and Gus chuckle]

08:25.122 --> 08:26.790
I had a feeling you two would get along.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.041
Better than the last guy.

08:28.125 --> 08:30.502
Remember when he fell asleep at the table?

08:30.585 --> 08:32.587
- [Gus chuckles awkwardly]
- Have you decided?

08:32.669 --> 08:35.465
[chuckles] Well, I've decided
that you are a ray of sunshine.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.591
What's your name?

08:36.674 --> 08:38.010
Pema.

08:38.092 --> 08:41.096
Pema, beautiful Pema, huh?
How's your day?

08:41.679 --> 08:43.807
- [Pema] It's good.
- Good, good.

08:45.142 --> 08:48.561
Good, all right, well, we are gonna
start off with a couple orders of samosas.

08:48.645 --> 08:53.442
And the tandoori shrimp,
uh, steamed momo,

08:53.942 --> 08:56.528
the lamb tikka masala...

08:57.988 --> 08:59.572
and the chicken vindaloo.

08:59.656 --> 09:00.657
Good choices.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.993
Uh, are you sure, Dad?
That's a lot of food.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.620
I live large.
Don't worry, lunch is on me.

09:06.204 --> 09:08.248
Hey, thank you.

09:08.331 --> 09:10.834
So, uh, what brings you into town?

09:10.917 --> 09:14.755
Oh, well, Southwest doesn't fly direct
to San Francisco from where I live.

09:15.672 --> 09:17.632
But I'm heading up to Palo Alto.

09:17.715 --> 09:20.028
Got a meeting with an investor I think
is going to help me out

09:20.052 --> 09:21.219
with this new app I've got.

09:21.303 --> 09:24.181
Oh, okay.
What's the... what's the idea?

09:24.264 --> 09:25.808
It's like Uber, but better.

09:25.891 --> 09:28.643
[stutters] You know, it's the better Uber.

09:28.726 --> 09:29.727
[chuckles]

09:31.521 --> 09:33.606
These things are
all about right place, right time.

09:33.690 --> 09:36.109
I mean, I've had guys rip me off,
make money off my ideas,

09:36.193 --> 09:38.111
but that is not gonna happen this time.

09:38.195 --> 09:42.365
Well, uh, I just wanna say, we're so glad
to have you in town and, uh,

09:42.449 --> 09:44.701
maybe I'll get to find out
a little bit more about

09:44.785 --> 09:46.578
what this one was like as a kid, huh?

09:46.661 --> 09:49.456
- You got any, uh, funny stories?
- Oh, my God, where to begin?

09:49.539 --> 09:52.960
- No. No, no.
- Oh, never mind. Forget it. Yeah.

09:53.043 --> 09:55.378
- She ever tell you about the whip-its?
- Oh! Dad, come on.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.755
Seventh grade.
Her mother has to pick her up from school,

09:57.840 --> 10:02.135
because she has been busted doing whip-its
in the parking lot at 11:00 a.m.

10:02.219 --> 10:04.054
Mickey, you little scamp. [chuckles]

10:04.137 --> 10:05.388
That was a long time ago.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.598
It was hard to punish her,

10:06.681 --> 10:08.350
because we've all done whip-its, right?

10:10.227 --> 10:11.587
[chuckles nervously] All the time.

10:11.644 --> 10:12.705
She ever tell you about the time

10:12.729 --> 10:14.773
she got out of the car
in the middle of the night?

10:14.856 --> 10:17.317
Uh, I don't think so,
but you don't have to... tell me.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.111
So, I'm driving her home, right?

10:19.194 --> 10:22.530
It's late. It's dark. I'm tired.
She's in the back. What are you, like, 13?

10:22.614 --> 10:23.656
No, I was 11.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.951
Either way, she will not stop complaining.

10:26.034 --> 10:27.303
I don't even remember
what she was talking about,

10:27.327 --> 10:30.413
but she is bitching and moaning
and I finally just say,

10:30.497 --> 10:33.125
"Hey, if you don't behave,
I'm pulling over."

10:33.208 --> 10:35.543
- Classic dad move.
- But when I pull up at the light...

10:36.879 --> 10:38.421
this kid gets out.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.298
That's not exactly
how I remember it, but...

10:40.382 --> 10:42.675
I am talking middle of the night,
Jersey City.

10:42.759 --> 10:44.052
Homeless people, drunks.

10:44.136 --> 10:46.072
God knows what kind of dangerous people
wandering around.

10:46.096 --> 10:48.015
I'm yelling at her,
"Hey, get back in here!"

10:48.098 --> 10:50.267
- [Gus chuckling]
- Of course, she doesn't listen.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.479
So I spent the rest of the night
looking for her,

10:54.562 --> 10:57.024
thinking she'd been kidnapped
or God knows what.

10:58.525 --> 11:01.862
And then I find her...

11:01.945 --> 11:05.991
at a Burger King,
eating french fries and having a ball.

11:06.074 --> 11:08.911
- [chuckles]
- [Gus] Wow, that's a crazy story.

11:08.994 --> 11:11.162
This one's always been
a little troublemaker.

11:11.621 --> 11:14.666
We tell her to do something,
she does the opposite.

11:18.420 --> 11:20.005
But that's what we love about her.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.091
[inhales deeply]

11:23.175 --> 11:26.594
Lord knows she's had to put up
with my shit too, so... [chuckles]

11:27.804 --> 11:31.433
Mmm.
Beautiful Pema, what have you got for us?

11:31.516 --> 11:32.976
- Samosas...
- Mmm-mmm.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.102
That's good.

11:35.020 --> 11:37.314
Oh, yeah! Looking good!

11:37.689 --> 11:41.192
Yeah, I think I'm going to, uh,
go wash the airplane off my hands.

11:41.276 --> 11:42.277
I'll be right back.

11:46.489 --> 11:47.532
Fuck him.

11:49.326 --> 11:50.452
I'm so tired of his shit.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.662
He loves telling
that stupid fucking story.

11:52.745 --> 11:56.541
[sighs] I'm sorry. I feel like I'm the one
who told him to tell it, so...

11:56.624 --> 11:58.876
You want to know
why I was so upset that night?

11:58.961 --> 12:01.588
It's because I missed
my best friend's birthday party,

12:01.671 --> 12:04.191
because I spent the whole day
sitting in the lobby of his office

12:04.215 --> 12:07.052
while he pitched some shady business deal.

12:07.844 --> 12:10.222
When he stopped the car,
he was yelling at me,

12:10.305 --> 12:13.141
so when he told me to get out,
I thought he was serious,

12:13.225 --> 12:15.268
because I was 11 years old!

12:16.353 --> 12:19.522
So I got out and then he just drove away.

12:19.606 --> 12:22.692
Oh, and he'll tell you that it was,
you know, just around the block.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.278
But he fucking left me there.

12:25.362 --> 12:30.117
And I was just sitting there, by myself,
on the corner, in the dark,

12:30.200 --> 12:32.369
for what felt like forever.

12:32.953 --> 12:38.792
So I just walked to a Burger King
and sat in the corner and cried.

12:38.875 --> 12:41.794
And I have never been
so scared in my life.

12:43.671 --> 12:45.590
[sighs]

12:45.673 --> 12:47.217
Mickey, that's awful.

12:48.385 --> 12:49.385
Yep.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.223
Look, I don't know
if this will make you feel better,

12:53.306 --> 12:56.518
but, you know, lot of times,
when we're kids,

12:56.601 --> 13:00.355
we feel things, like,
a little more severely than what's real.

13:00.438 --> 13:01.898
Are you taking his side?

13:03.066 --> 13:05.151
No, no. I'm just saying...

13:05.943 --> 13:08.905
stuff like this is always,
like, super complicated, you know?

13:09.947 --> 13:12.617
It's like that thing they say,
"It's corny, but it's true."

13:12.700 --> 13:14.470
It's like our parents know
which buttons to push,

13:14.494 --> 13:15.679
because they're the ones
who installed them.

13:15.703 --> 13:17.330
Dude, you don't have to fix everything.

13:17.414 --> 13:19.666
Okay? Jesus! Whatever!

13:20.709 --> 13:22.377
I just... All I ever wanted...

13:22.960 --> 13:24.129
[sighs] Forget it.

13:25.088 --> 13:26.089
[sighs]

13:27.299 --> 13:28.300
[Marty sighs]

13:29.259 --> 13:31.844
All righty, let me at this food!

13:31.928 --> 13:33.471
- [Mickey] Mmm.
- [Marty chuckling]

13:33.555 --> 13:34.556
Mmm.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.185
A little bland.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.360
[Gus] Well, that was excellent.

13:47.444 --> 13:49.487
- Yes.
- Should I box this up?

13:49.571 --> 13:52.657
Oh, nah.
Here, uh... Here's the card.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.180
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yeah, thanks, Marty.

13:54.242 --> 13:57.287
Yeah, well, I've had better vindaloo,
but I liked it okay.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.500
Do you wanna come back to my place?

14:02.584 --> 14:04.211
Get settled in?

14:04.294 --> 14:05.295
Didn't you get my text?

14:06.171 --> 14:07.297
- I don't think so.
- No?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.881
Oh, maybe it didn't go through.

14:08.965 --> 14:10.300
No, uh, my plans changed.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.095
I'm on the 8:00 p.m.
to San Francisco tonight.

14:13.178 --> 14:15.448
I figured I'd get up there early,
get a good night's sleep

14:15.472 --> 14:16.556
before the big meeting.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.226
Oh, okay.

14:19.309 --> 14:23.188
I mean, don't you want to
just come see where I live?

14:23.271 --> 14:25.273
It's the first nice place
I've ever lived in.

14:25.357 --> 14:28.193
Oh, sweetheart, I came to see you,
not your place.

14:29.111 --> 14:31.113
Do you really want to spend three hours
in a car,

14:31.196 --> 14:32.697
driving across town?

14:32.780 --> 14:34.866
I'd rather just, you know,
find some place.

14:34.949 --> 14:37.202
We could sit and talk.
I'll see your place next time.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.288
Okay, yeah. That makes sense.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.588
[inhales deeply]

14:48.671 --> 14:50.382
All right, where to now?

14:50.465 --> 14:52.592
Yeah, uh, what do you think, Mickey?

14:53.093 --> 14:54.844
Hey, let's get a drink, huh?
Celebrate.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.179
- [Gus] Hmm.
- Celebrate what?

14:56.805 --> 14:59.641
Us. [chuckles] Life. My new business.

14:59.724 --> 15:03.228
All good things, huh?
What, do we need a reason to celebrate?

15:03.311 --> 15:06.731
Yeah, um, maybe we could go to that,
uh, donut place that's around here?

15:06.814 --> 15:07.815
It's pretty awesome.

15:07.899 --> 15:11.986
They got all these crazy flavors,
like marshmallow and basil, but...

15:12.945 --> 15:14.614
it's not gross like I'm making it sound.

15:14.697 --> 15:16.741
[chuckles] I don't want a donut.
We just ate.

15:16.824 --> 15:19.494
Right, right, right. Uh... [stammers]

15:19.577 --> 15:20.912
What about a museum?

15:20.995 --> 15:23.790
There's an exhibit around here
that's about medieval torture devices.

15:23.873 --> 15:27.252
- Could be really fun, I think?
- Yeah. Yeah, come on, you need a drink.

15:27.335 --> 15:28.336
- Over here.
- [Gus] Okay.

15:36.511 --> 15:37.595
[door chimes]

15:40.097 --> 15:41.724
[sighs] Hello.

15:42.684 --> 15:44.936
Uh, you guys grab a table.
I'll get some drinks, okay?

15:45.019 --> 15:47.564
- [Gus] Okay.
- This place reeks.

15:49.274 --> 15:51.318
- What's your name?
- Carol.

15:51.401 --> 15:53.611
- Carol, huh? Beautiful Carol.
- Yes.

15:53.695 --> 15:55.363
- Ah...
- Marty Dobbs. How are you?

15:55.447 --> 15:57.487
- Marty Dobbs, how are you?
- What are you drinking?

15:58.366 --> 16:00.993
I hate this.
I hate everything about this.

16:01.077 --> 16:03.538
What... [sighs]
What am I doing in a bar?

16:04.581 --> 16:06.708
Yeah. Are you okay?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.751
You, um... You tempted or...

16:08.835 --> 16:11.421
No. I don't... [sighing]

16:11.504 --> 16:13.047
- I don't know!
- [laughing]

16:14.424 --> 16:16.259
Well, here's to you, Jersey girl!

16:16.343 --> 16:18.863
I don't wanna watch him drink
during the day. He's an alcoholic.

16:18.887 --> 16:19.887
You think so?

16:20.305 --> 16:23.183
He got a DUI when I was in high school
and had his license suspended.

16:23.266 --> 16:25.685
He had to go to court-mandated AA.

16:25.768 --> 16:28.088
You know what, let's get out of here.
Tell him we wanna go.

16:28.896 --> 16:32.275
No, let's just stay.
It's not worth it to piss off Marty Dobbs.

16:33.276 --> 16:34.944
Whatever you need,
I'm here for you, okay?

16:35.945 --> 16:37.071
Seriously.

16:37.154 --> 16:38.314
[Marty] Can you believe this?

16:38.990 --> 16:41.534
You see that lady over there?
Her name's Carol.

16:41.618 --> 16:45.247
She grew up two towns away from me
and here we are, meeting in a bar in LA.

16:45.330 --> 16:46.890
- What are the chances of that?
- [glasses clink]

16:46.914 --> 16:49.376
- Serendipity.
- All righty.

16:49.459 --> 16:51.544
Gussy, grab your glass!

16:52.920 --> 16:54.964
Mickle the pickle. [sighs]

16:55.047 --> 16:57.008
And one for the pops.

16:57.091 --> 17:00.762
Here's to my beautiful daughter
and to Gus.

17:01.721 --> 17:02.722
Love you, Mick.

17:05.016 --> 17:07.352
Hey, come on, it's bad luck not to cheers.
Come on.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.732
Hey! All right.

17:13.650 --> 17:15.943
I don't really feel like a beer,
so I'm gonna go smoke.

17:21.324 --> 17:24.243
I could never figure out that kid's moods.

17:24.327 --> 17:26.579
[chuckles] God bless you, if you can.

17:26.663 --> 17:29.291
Uh, I just try to listen.

17:29.374 --> 17:30.684
You should ask her how she's doing.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.127
I think, uh, it might turn things
around a bit.

17:33.210 --> 17:37.173
I don't get it. I mean,
I come here, and she gets all quiet.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.175
[scoffs]
Won't even have a beer with her dad.

17:39.259 --> 17:43.012
Hmm, well,
I wouldn't take it too personally.

17:43.095 --> 17:46.516
I think she's, um...
She wants to, but...

17:47.350 --> 17:48.351
What?

17:49.060 --> 17:51.729
Well... she's sober.

17:52.522 --> 17:53.523
Sober?

17:53.606 --> 17:56.609
Yeah, like, um, you know,
in the... in the program.

17:57.193 --> 17:59.487
- AA, huh?
- Yeah.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.072
Again. [chuckles]

18:02.407 --> 18:04.033
Well, good luck with that, Micks.

18:05.827 --> 18:07.203
I think it's really good for her.

18:30.267 --> 18:33.938
- Sweetheart, can I bum a smoke?
- Sure. Here you go.

18:42.822 --> 18:46.075
- Best happy hour in the city, this place.
- That's awesome.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.785
Three-dollar well drinks.

18:47.869 --> 18:50.830
Only problem is it doesn't start
for two more hours.

18:50.913 --> 18:52.457
Carol got here too early.

18:53.541 --> 18:55.084
[chuckles]

18:55.668 --> 18:58.546
- I'm Carol. [snorts and laughs]
- Oh.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.970
You got yourself a good daddy.

19:06.596 --> 19:08.515
Oh, yeah, he's a real great guy.

19:08.598 --> 19:11.684
He sure is.
He came all the way out here to see you.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.438
Lucky girl.

19:20.067 --> 19:23.154
Carol, your, uh, nipple's out.

19:24.406 --> 19:26.366
Oh, whoopsies!

19:27.784 --> 19:28.785
Whoops.

19:32.497 --> 19:33.498
[music playing]

19:33.581 --> 19:36.083
Hey, you know, Gus, I think I saw
a jukebox over there.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.127
Why don't you go
pick us out some tunes, huh?

19:38.210 --> 19:40.380
Oh, I don't want
to waste your money, Marty.

19:40.463 --> 19:42.190
Who knows how long it'll take
to play the song?

19:42.214 --> 19:44.384
I'm not nervous.
Go for it, bud.

19:45.760 --> 19:48.680
Uh... [exhales slowly] okay.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.724
Cool. Be right back.

19:56.646 --> 19:57.646
So, Mick?

19:59.899 --> 20:01.859
Gus told me something interesting.

20:01.943 --> 20:03.403
Oh, what's that?

20:04.278 --> 20:05.405
He says you're in AA.

20:06.989 --> 20:08.408
He told you that?

20:09.450 --> 20:11.369
Why would you do that to yourself again?

20:13.871 --> 20:15.122
Because I have a problem.

20:15.206 --> 20:17.500
AA is just a load of bullshit.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.168
You know how I feel about this.

20:19.251 --> 20:22.338
[stammers] That is for people
that cannot think for themselves.

20:22.422 --> 20:26.426
AA was started by a bunch of evangelicals
who were fuck-ups.

20:26.509 --> 20:28.720
But they want to make us feel
like we got the problem.

20:28.803 --> 20:30.179
I don't have a problem.

20:30.262 --> 20:31.514
You don't have a problem.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.198
They just want to make you think you do.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.267
I am an alcoholic, Dad.

20:35.351 --> 20:37.645
I need help.
AA is helping me.

20:37.728 --> 20:39.397
Hmm. Yeah. All right, let me guess.

20:39.480 --> 20:41.774
You go to the meetings
and you complain about your dad?

20:41.858 --> 20:43.860
Is that it, huh?
It's all my fault?

20:43.943 --> 20:46.320
- [Gus groans softly]
- Jesus, Mickey.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.491
I raised you to use your brain.
Not join a cult!

20:52.368 --> 20:56.122
Hey, Marty, I just want to say...

20:57.164 --> 20:58.833
you have an amazing daughter.

20:58.916 --> 21:00.960
And you should be so proud of her.

21:01.043 --> 21:03.129
Mmm. Thank you for saying that, Gus.

21:03.212 --> 21:04.672
That means a lot, coming from a guy

21:04.755 --> 21:07.008
I hadn't even heard about
until an hour ago.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.137
Okay. All right.
Let's just take a breath here.

21:11.220 --> 21:13.806
Gus, just stay out of it, okay? Jesus.

21:16.017 --> 21:17.018
[Marty] AA.

21:17.894 --> 21:19.479
[scoffing] Oh, my God.

21:21.438 --> 21:22.524
Fuck.

21:31.782 --> 21:34.285
[inhales deeply]
So tell me about your app, Dad.

21:34.785 --> 21:35.785
Well...

21:37.163 --> 21:40.374
it's called the R Car.

21:40.875 --> 21:43.836
It's a high-end car service
that comes and picks you up.

21:44.712 --> 21:46.172
So, it's exactly like Uber?

21:46.255 --> 21:49.676
No. No, because you can reserve
your car in advance.

21:49.759 --> 21:53.137
That's what the R stands for.
You can't do that with Uber.

21:53.220 --> 21:56.241
Well, there are Ubers around all the time,
so you don't need to reserve them.

21:56.265 --> 21:59.101
What about after a sporting event? Huh?
What about at the airport?

21:59.185 --> 22:02.021
I've never had to wait
for more than four minutes for an Uber.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.732
We also have great cars.

22:04.816 --> 22:08.695
They got bottles of water and mints
and iPhone jacks.

22:08.778 --> 22:11.113
You can charge your phone,
play your music.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.489
Yeah, Uber's got all of that.

22:12.573 --> 22:17.870
And... and you can pick the kind of car
you want to get.

22:19.121 --> 22:21.916
Oh, that's cool.
So, could I get, like, a Ferrari?

22:21.999 --> 22:23.167
[chuckles]

22:24.168 --> 22:26.087
Well, maybe not a Ferrari.
But, uh...

22:26.170 --> 22:28.130
So it's exactly like Uber.

22:31.258 --> 22:32.426
[scoffs]

22:35.012 --> 22:36.013
[glass thuds]

22:38.474 --> 22:39.475
[chuckles]

22:40.476 --> 22:42.604
Uh, you know what, I...

22:43.730 --> 22:46.357
- I should probably get going. Yeah.
- [Mickey] Mmm.

22:47.316 --> 22:49.196
I gotta get back to the airport,
get checked in.

22:49.276 --> 22:52.071
I might as well get there early.
Get situated.

22:52.655 --> 22:55.074
Ah, but your flight's not
for another few hours.

22:55.157 --> 22:59.078
Oh, no, no, no. You should go now.
Get situated. Uh, do you want a ride?

22:59.161 --> 23:00.881
- No, I'm fine.
- We should call you a taxi,

23:00.955 --> 23:03.115
'cause you probably
wouldn't want to take an Uber, huh?

23:03.833 --> 23:05.126
That's a good one.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.336
Yeah. I got to go square up.

23:23.895 --> 23:25.062
How's Uncle Tim?

23:25.146 --> 23:26.272
[scoffs]

23:27.231 --> 23:28.231
Still a fuck-up.

23:29.191 --> 23:31.318
[Gus] Here we go. Okay.

23:31.402 --> 23:33.070
Marty, let me give you these.

23:33.154 --> 23:34.613
- All right.
- Okay.

23:34.697 --> 23:36.073
Good luck up there!

23:36.574 --> 23:37.575
- Thanks.
- Okay.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.536
All right. Bye, Micks.
Don't be a stranger.

23:41.537 --> 23:42.538
Love you.

23:43.581 --> 23:45.583
[chuckles] I love you, too.

23:51.213 --> 23:52.214
All right.

24:19.116 --> 24:20.117
[Mickey sighs]

24:21.202 --> 24:23.746
Why would you tell my dad that I'm sober?

24:23.830 --> 24:27.083
Do you know how fucked up that is,
to break somebody's anonymity?

24:27.166 --> 24:30.127
- To their dad?
- Okay. I was trying to help.

24:30.211 --> 24:32.922
I didn't want your help.
Your help is not helping.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.424
I just wanted you
to be a buffer between us.

24:35.507 --> 24:36.884
That's what I thought I was doing.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.886
I wanted him to see I was grown up

24:38.970 --> 24:42.139
and I had my shit together and maybe,
maybe he would just treat me differently.

24:42.223 --> 24:45.851
And we could have a decent day for once.
But it was the same thing.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.229
It's always gonna be the same.

24:49.271 --> 24:50.314
You don't know that.

24:50.397 --> 24:52.233
Things change.
People change.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.861
I almost got through one day with him
without a fight.

24:54.944 --> 24:57.404
But then you had to go
and fucking tell him about AA

24:57.488 --> 24:58.990
and he got all pissed off.

24:59.073 --> 25:02.243
That is so fucked up, Gus!

25:02.326 --> 25:04.161
I can't even be in a car
with you right now.

25:05.830 --> 25:08.457
Oh, my God...
Mickey, come on!

25:10.793 --> 25:12.962
- Jesus Christ.
- [door slams]

25:13.045 --> 25:14.171
[Mickey] Fuck.

25:14.255 --> 25:15.256
- Mickey, wait!
- [sighs]

25:15.339 --> 25:17.341
Come on!
Come on, just wait. Hold on.

25:17.424 --> 25:19.135
[sighs] Oh, God.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.469
Just...

25:21.553 --> 25:24.766
Do you really fucking need
people to like you that badly?

25:24.849 --> 25:27.184
I'm the one who should matter to you.
Not him.

25:27.268 --> 25:29.478
"Oh, Marty, you're so funny."

25:29.561 --> 25:32.106
[sighs] You should have stood up for me.

25:32.189 --> 25:34.608
I tried, but you told me to, like...

25:34.691 --> 25:36.837
- Oh, Jesus. Just stop it!
- It's very confusing for me.

25:36.861 --> 25:38.612
You want me... your dad to like me.

25:38.695 --> 25:40.782
Am I supposed to have him hate me?
Do I... What?

25:40.865 --> 25:42.283
Shut the fuck up!

25:49.540 --> 25:52.418
I'm sorry. Okay? [sighs]

25:55.880 --> 25:56.881
[sighs]

25:58.549 --> 26:00.009
I know I messed up, and...

26:02.344 --> 26:03.762
I'm truly sorry.

26:06.682 --> 26:07.850
I'm sorry too.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.185
I'm... [sighs]

26:11.020 --> 26:12.855
It's really not you. It's him.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.650
He was shitty to you.
It's okay to be upset.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.990
I'll give you a ride home
so you can get a break from me.

26:25.326 --> 26:26.953
I don't want a break from you.

26:32.583 --> 26:33.583
Okay?

26:34.001 --> 26:35.294
[Mickey sighs]

26:46.889 --> 26:50.101
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, my God, that could be my dad's plane.

26:50.184 --> 26:51.310
Fuck you!

26:51.393 --> 26:54.230
Yeah. Fuck you, Marty!
