00:02.560 --> 00:05.120
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.680
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.680 --> 00:10.720
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.760
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.760 --> 00:19.840
and I'm drenched 
 in some weird chemical.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.360
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:37.720 --> 00:40.920
My best friend Ray 
 thinks it's cool.

00:40.920 --> 00:44.160
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.720
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.760
Not even my parents.

00:51.240 --> 00:54.240
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:54.240 --> 00:56.000
and turn me into some experiment.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.360
But you know something?

00:57.360 --> 01:01.040
I guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.560
Alex... Alex, wake up.

01:12.560 --> 01:17.200
Dad? 
 What are you doing up so early?

01:17.200 --> 01:20.600
I have a presentation 
 to make on GC-161.

01:20.600 --> 01:23.520
- I need you. 
 - [sighs]

01:23.520 --> 01:28.600
I thought I had it all worked out 
 but it's reading "incomplete."

01:28.600 --> 01:30.480
This is the last time, Dad.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.960
I can't keep doing 
 all your work for you.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.320
I made some cocoa 
 before I woke you.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.560
It's cold.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.280
[zapping]

01:58.280 --> 02:00.320
Ah... perfect.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.240
Here's your problem, Dad.

02:11.240 --> 02:15.800
The convergence equation 
 is off by .232.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.760
- It can't complete itself. 
 - Unbelievable.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.920
Alex, what would I do without you?

02:22.920 --> 02:24.840
Mmm...

02:27.120 --> 02:29.000
[zapping]

02:29.000 --> 02:31.760
[zapping and buzzing]

02:40.040 --> 02:43.840
[alarm clock ringing]

02:43.840 --> 02:45.920
Alex...

02:46.720 --> 02:48.560
Alex!

02:52.680 --> 02:55.240
Annie... what's wrong?

02:55.240 --> 02:58.720
You're dreaming again! 
 That's what's wrong.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.280
[knocking on door]

03:00.280 --> 03:02.600
[Mr Mack] Annie? Alex? 
 You girls all right?

03:03.680 --> 03:06.000
[groans]

03:06.760 --> 03:08.160
Good morning, Dad.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.000
What was all that noise?

03:10.000 --> 03:13.200
Um, Annie just knocked 
 some of her books over.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.520
Look at this mess.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.680
Alex, you've got to try 
 and be a little neater.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.600
Please clean up this room 
 before you leave for school.

03:28.840 --> 03:31.640
Bottom of the 12th, 
 two outs, two men on.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.240
Dad says it's late, 
 I say no way.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.360
Just as he's about 
 to send me to bed, wham!

03:37.360 --> 03:39.920
- A three-run homer. 
 - Sure.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.640
At the moment 
 I realized my destiny.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.760
- The big leagues. 
 - Yeah, right.

03:46.760 --> 03:50.720
Dad and I sometimes stay up 
 all night talking about baseball.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.160
He's even getting off 
 early from work

03:53.160 --> 03:56.440
and come home and teach me 
 a few of his pitches.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.640
That's great.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.400
Why don't you grab your mitt 
 and come on over?

04:01.400 --> 04:05.400
No... I have some stuff 
 to do at home.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.760
Dad!

04:20.560 --> 04:21.560
Dad!

04:25.280 --> 04:27.400
Hey, Dad, 
 want to play some catch?

04:27.400 --> 04:30.200
Oh! Alex, 
 look what you made me do.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.920
You really have to be more careful.

04:32.920 --> 04:36.680
- Look at this. 
 - I just wanted to play some catch.

04:36.680 --> 04:40.320
Not right now, honey, I have 
 a lot of work to go over.

04:40.320 --> 04:42.640
Is this a game anyone can play?

04:42.640 --> 04:45.680
Alex was a little 
 over-enthusiastic to see me.

04:45.680 --> 04:49.080
So am I-- 
 I've reached the next level

04:49.080 --> 04:53.000
- of my D.N.A. project. 
 - Dad has a lot of work to catch up on.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.800
Already? That's amazing.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.240
We were only talking about it 
 three weeks ago.

04:58.240 --> 05:01.800
It was two, but once you 
 explained the principles

05:01.800 --> 05:03.360
I understood it.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.320
Come on, I want to show you.

05:05.320 --> 05:09.160
- You grasped that concept so quick... 
 - I know.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.360
Maybe we'll play some other time.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.200
Daddy, can you check 
 my book report for me?

05:40.200 --> 05:43.360
Oh, uh... sure, honey. 
 Let's see... the yearling.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.600
I don't believe I've read this one.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.680
It's about this poor, 
 lonely kid in Florida.

05:48.680 --> 05:51.240
I'm not sure I explained 
 the theme right.

05:51.480 --> 05:53.800
- Does it sound okay? 
 - The theme?

05:53.800 --> 05:55.720
Is that the same as the plot?

05:55.720 --> 05:59.960
To be honest, your mom is 
 much better at english than me.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.760
Sure. Okay, Dad.

06:14.520 --> 06:16.000
[clears throat]

06:16.000 --> 06:18.520
George, could I see you 
 in the kitchen?

06:18.520 --> 06:20.440
In a minute, honey.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.280
Now, George.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.600
Uh-oh.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.960
George, you're a wonderfully 
 kind loving, generous man...

06:30.960 --> 06:32.280
Thank you, Barbara.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.840
But sometimes you manage 
 to hide all of that.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.720
I did something wrong?

06:36.720 --> 06:39.480
Only if you consider 
 ignoring Alex wrong.

06:39.480 --> 06:43.120
I didn't ignore her. 
 Your english is better than mine.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.440
That's not the point.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.520
You need to be there for her 
 as much as you are for Annie.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.960
Now, Barbara, 
 aren't you exaggerating?

06:50.960 --> 06:54.120
Actually, I think 
 I'm minimizing this problem.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.040
You know Annie and me 
 have a special... rapport.

06:58.040 --> 07:01.680
- It's "Annie and I." 
 - You see what I mean about my english?

07:01.680 --> 07:03.320
George, I'm being serious.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.200
You need to find a way 
 to make this up to her.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.520
You're right. 
 What do you suggest?

07:09.520 --> 07:13.880
I suggest... that you 
 figure this out on your own...

07:14.560 --> 07:18.240
- By Saturday. 
 - Saturday?!

07:19.160 --> 07:21.520
It was my dad's 
 screwball that got me.

07:21.520 --> 07:24.440
I was thinking about 
 my hall-of-fame speech

07:24.680 --> 07:27.160
when, bam! The ball 
 bounced off the glove

07:27.160 --> 07:28.640
and hit me in my head.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.560
I'd rather get conked on 
 the head than play catch by myself.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.960
But check this out.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.280
Dad felt so bad about beaning me 
 he offered to take us

07:37.280 --> 07:39.320
to the amusement park tomorrow.

07:39.320 --> 07:42.200
He says the new 
 Thunderstorm Roller Coaster

07:42.200 --> 07:44.720
might be safer for me 
 than playing catch.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.400
The one that does 
 the 360-degree loop?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.120
Yes!

07:56.160 --> 07:59.000
Alex! 
 I have a surprise for you.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.400
We're going on a little trip-- 
 just you and me.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.760
Isn't that great?

08:03.760 --> 08:06.240
- A trip? Great. When? 
 - Tomorrow.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.800
Tomorrow won't work, Dad.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.360
I'm going with Ray and his dad 
 to the new Thunderstorm ride

08:11.360 --> 08:12.920
at the amusement park.

08:12.920 --> 08:15.240
I'm sorry, Alex, 
 this is something

08:15.240 --> 08:17.160
your mother really wants us to do.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.560
I mean, it's something 
 I want us to do.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.520
It'll be more fun than 
 any roller coaster ride.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.240
Yeah... I'm sure.

08:27.360 --> 08:28.560
[car starting]

08:28.560 --> 08:31.400
[man on radio] 
 Good morning, Paradise Valley.

08:31.400 --> 08:34.080
It's going to be another hot, 
 hot day

08:34.080 --> 08:36.200
in the land of sun and science.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.559
[calypso music playing on radio]

08:46.520 --> 08:50.720
- [calypso music continues playing] 
 - Seventh grade was touch.

08:50.720 --> 08:52.800
I remember how I struggled

08:52.800 --> 08:56.160
with my paper on 
 electromagnetic radiation.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.640
You did that 
 when you were my age?

08:58.640 --> 09:02.160
Well, actually I was a couple 
 of years younger than you.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.680
I skipped two grades.

09:03.680 --> 09:07.520
Uh... but, Alex, 
 we all have our own talents.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.560
Like that key chain 
 you made for me

09:10.560 --> 09:13.360
in camp a couple of years ago?

09:13.360 --> 09:15.480
I couldn't have done that.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.600
Hi, honey, I'm going 
 to run some errands.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.440
You want to come with me?

09:25.440 --> 09:30.120
No, I can't, I'm working on my D.N.A. 
 project and I have a deadline.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.800
- Okay, you want any help? 
 - I don't think so.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.600
I'm attempting to 
 create a fabrication

09:35.600 --> 09:38.520
of how man might evolve 
 into the 21st century.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.760
- Great. 
 - See you later?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.120
Okay.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.840
We're almost here, Alex.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.520
Dad... where's there?

09:48.520 --> 09:50.800
My favorite place when I was a kid.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.160
It was filled with fun and adventure.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.640
- What is it? 
 - Rocks, Alex, rocks.

09:56.640 --> 09:58.160
[chuckling]

09:58.160 --> 10:01.760
Your first geological experience. 
 You'll never forget it.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.920
Rocks are going to be 
 more fun than Thundrstorm?

10:04.920 --> 10:06.560
Absolutely.

10:06.560 --> 10:10.120
Dad, are you sure 
 you know where we're going?

10:10.120 --> 10:12.880
This place looks kind of... scary.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.320
Scary? Not at all, honey.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.040
[animal howling]

10:34.280 --> 10:37.480
Oh... oh... very, very interesting.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.440
Normally this type of quartz 
 isn't found around this area.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.000
Really...

10:46.000 --> 10:48.280
This whole area was a silver mine.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.920
I came here a lot when I was a kid.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.240
Maybe you found everything 
 interesting back then.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.000
Here, Alex, let me help you.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.120
Whoa... oh.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.240
[sighs] 
 I don't need your help, Dad.

11:01.240 --> 11:03.360
I think I can find my own rocks.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.480
Alex, be careful.

11:05.480 --> 11:09.160
Don't worry, 
 I can take care of myself.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.360
[screaming]

11:17.320 --> 11:20.760
[screaming]

11:36.320 --> 11:38.400
Daddy! Over here!

11:38.400 --> 11:41.800
Daddy! I'm over... 
 [screaming]

12:02.640 --> 12:06.000
[wind whistling]

12:09.400 --> 12:11.160
Dad!

12:11.160 --> 12:13.360
[echoing]: ...Dad!

12:13.360 --> 12:15.560
Dad!... Dad!

12:39.680 --> 12:41.800
[zapping]

12:50.360 --> 12:52.240
Help!... help!

12:52.240 --> 12:55.920
Somebody help me!... help me!

12:59.680 --> 13:00.800
[knock on door]

13:00.800 --> 13:03.360
Hi, honey, I'm home. 
 how's it going?

13:03.360 --> 13:04.960
Slowly.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.280
Hey, how about you take a break

13:09.280 --> 13:11.520
and come have 
 some lunch with me?

13:11.520 --> 13:14.360
- No, thanks, Mom. 
 - This is great.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.760
Please don't.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.640
Does this spin... ooh! Oop!

13:17.640 --> 13:18.960
Be... be careful.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.720
Sorry, I didn't mean 
 to delay man's evolution.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.120
Make fun if you want, 
 but it's really important to me.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.440
Aren't you getting 
 a little too tense about this?

13:28.440 --> 13:31.320
- No, I need to finish this. 
 - By when?

13:32.360 --> 13:35.680
- By whenever. 
 - I thought so.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.200
You get back to work. 
 I'll see you later.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.880
- [pieces fall] 
 - Oh...

13:45.800 --> 13:48.800
[sighing] 
 Mom, wait.

13:50.040 --> 13:54.720
- Maybe I could eat something. 
 - So come on.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.880
[grunting]

14:30.000 --> 14:32.360
[wind whistling]

14:40.520 --> 14:43.200
Daddy?... Daddy?

14:43.200 --> 14:47.400
Dad!... Dad!... Dad!

14:48.480 --> 14:50.880
Alex?! ...Alex?!

14:50.880 --> 14:52.960
Alex?!... Alex?!

14:52.960 --> 14:55.200
Alex!

14:57.480 --> 15:01.480
[grunting and groaning]

15:03.560 --> 15:07.040
[grunting and groaning]

15:13.000 --> 15:14.920
[panting]

15:21.520 --> 15:23.400
Alex!

15:23.400 --> 15:26.400
Alex, where are you?

15:26.400 --> 15:30.520
Daddy! Down here! 
 Daddy!

15:33.360 --> 15:36.360
Alex! 
 Are you okay?!

15:36.360 --> 15:39.360
Yeah, I think so. 
 Daddy, get me out of here.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.040
Don't worry, I'll get help

15:41.040 --> 15:43.240
and have you out of there 
 in no time.

15:43.240 --> 15:45.640
No! 
 Daddy, don't leave me.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.720
[bird cawing]

16:05.120 --> 16:07.560
I remember when you 
 were a little girl

16:07.560 --> 16:10.440
Daddy told you about 
 the theory of relativity

16:10.440 --> 16:13.800
and you got all excited. 
 You must have been proud.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.720
Actually I was frightened. 
 You were only eight.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.840
I know I get intense about 
 my work but I'm always feeling

16:20.840 --> 16:23.400
like I have to achieve 
 something big.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.640
Sweetheart, 
 you'll achieve a lot.

16:25.640 --> 16:28.000
But sometimes you 
 have to take a break.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
There's more to life than work.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.560
That's actually something

16:31.560 --> 16:34.080
I have to keep 
 reminding myself about.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.560
I know what you mean.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.560
My friends were going 
 bowling the other night

16:38.560 --> 16:41.240
and for a second 
 I really wanted to go.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.520
- Then I decided not to, and... 
 - Wait a minute.

16:44.520 --> 16:46.600
You wanted to go bowling?

16:46.600 --> 16:51.040
Mm-hmm. See, this really cute 
 guy named Chris was going...

16:51.040 --> 16:52.640
Never mind... never mind.

16:52.640 --> 16:56.800
- I'm going to go finish my work. 
 - Wait a minute, come on, tell me.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.800
Tell me about Chris.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.800
Okay, he's in my history class 
 and he's really cute

17:02.800 --> 17:05.760
and he has this long hair 
 and he's so funny.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.880
- Does he know that you like him? 
 - No way!

17:08.880 --> 17:11.480
- Okay, I'll tell him. 
 - Mother...

17:16.079 --> 17:18.720
Step back, Alex. 
 Look out!

17:23.599 --> 17:25.880
Now put that around your waist.

17:26.800 --> 17:30.160
- Dad, you forgot to tie it. 
 - What?

17:30.160 --> 17:32.720
That's okay, I can do it.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.520
Okay, Dad... I'm ready.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.160
[grunts]

17:55.360 --> 17:57.400
- [grunting] 
 - [snap]

17:57.400 --> 17:59.600
Dad, hurry, it's breaking!

18:08.640 --> 18:12.040
- Hang on, Alex! 
 - [screams] I can't!

18:12.040 --> 18:16.440
- Grab my hand, Alex! 
 - Don't let me go, Dad!

18:16.440 --> 18:19.280
- Hurry, Daddy, help! 
 - [snap]

18:19.280 --> 18:21.840
[creaking]

18:23.480 --> 18:26.200
- [snap] 
 - Hang on!

18:29.240 --> 18:30.760
Help me!

18:33.120 --> 18:34.800
I got you!

18:35.400 --> 18:36.960
Hang on!

18:40.360 --> 18:43.720
[groaning and gasping]

18:48.800 --> 18:50.880
[chuckling]

18:52.480 --> 18:56.160
[Annie] The more I thought 
 about it, the more I was afraid

18:56.160 --> 18:58.960
I was going to make 
 a jerk out of myself.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.640
Let me get this straight.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.960
You understand gravity waves 
 and atom-splitting

19:03.960 --> 19:06.680
and you're afraid 
 of a few gutter balls?

19:06.680 --> 19:08.960
- Well... yeah. 
 - [chuckles]

19:08.960 --> 19:11.240
That's kind of the way 
 Alex and I feel

19:11.240 --> 19:14.040
when you and Daddy 
 start talking about science.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.640
I think it hurts Alex, too.

19:15.640 --> 19:18.960
She feels like there's 
 nothing special about her yet.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.880
I think she's starting 
 to get over that.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.440
[both chuckle]

19:23.440 --> 19:24.960
See? Isn't this nice?

19:24.960 --> 19:28.880
Just sitting around 
 doing nothing for a change?

19:28.880 --> 19:32.440
Yeah... but there's something 
 else I'd rather be doing.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.200
Oh, right, I know... 
 your D.N.A. project.

19:35.200 --> 19:39.120
- Go ahead, I understand. 
 - No, that's not it.

19:42.480 --> 19:46.160
- Could we go bowling together? 
 - Bowling?

19:46.160 --> 19:49.600
There's nothing else 
 I'd rather be doing.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.240
Let's go.

19:53.240 --> 19:56.840
Alex, I told you to be careful. 
 You didn't listen to me.

19:57.080 --> 19:59.160
Now you know what it's like, Dad.

19:59.160 --> 20:02.840
- Alex, I listen to you. 
 - Not like you listen to Annie.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.720
Isn't that why Mom 
 made you do this with me?

20:05.720 --> 20:08.920
Alex, it's true your mom 
 and I discussed this

20:08.920 --> 20:10.440
but I wanted to do it.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.560
Sometimes it's just easier 
 for me to talk to Annie

20:13.560 --> 20:16.160
because we both love science.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.120
Sorry I'm not a genius.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.520
You don't have to 
 apologize, Alex, I do.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.800
You're really so special.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.440
Sometimes I wish 
 I could be more like you.

20:27.440 --> 20:31.320
Like me? 
 I don't even want to be like me.

20:31.320 --> 20:35.240
Don't say that, Alex. 
 You do all these things I never did.

20:35.240 --> 20:36.800
I hardly ever played sports

20:36.800 --> 20:41.680
and I've never been to an 
 amusement park in my whole life.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.520
What kind of a kid were you?

20:43.520 --> 20:47.160
When I was your age I used 
 to stay here digging around

20:47.160 --> 20:49.280
until it got too dark to see.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.480
My dad would have to 
 come get me.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.160
That's when I first discovered science.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.480
I think I know what you mean.

20:56.480 --> 21:00.400
I'm discovering things 
 that are changing my life, too.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.520
Really, Alex? Like what?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.120
Well, um... maybe I'll tell you 
 on our next trip.

21:07.120 --> 21:10.480
Our next trip? 
 That sounds great, Alex.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.080
[engine grinding]

21:13.080 --> 21:16.400
- Dad, pop the hood. 
 - Alex, the battery's dead.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.080
You can't make it start. 
 Dad... just open the hood.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.240
[pop hood]

21:28.400 --> 21:30.480
Start it, Dad.

21:30.480 --> 21:35.000
- [engine grinding] 
 - [zapping]

21:35.240 --> 21:39.080
- [engine running] 
 - [calypso music playing on radio]

21:41.200 --> 21:42.720
You can fix cars?

21:42.720 --> 21:45.760
There's so much about you 
 I don't know, Alex.

21:45.760 --> 21:48.320
Girl's got to have a few secrets.

21:49.160 --> 21:52.000
Good evening, Paradise Valley!

21:52.000 --> 21:56.560
That was "Bali the Bullfighter" 
 by Storm Hippen.

21:56.560 --> 21:58.880
[announcer trilling]

21:58.880 --> 22:01.520
