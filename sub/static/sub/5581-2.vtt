01:00.000 --> 01:02.710
Tom writes that they've
opened the new sale room.

01:02.760 --> 01:05.269
What about Rose? What does
she have to say for herself?

01:05.319 --> 01:07.630
Oh, everything's good. New York is heaven.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.310
They're taking a house in
the Hamptons for the summer.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.640
- Ah! I think she could be pregnant.
- Golly! Why do you say that?

01:13.720 --> 01:15.510
She says, 'I might be back in August,

01:15.560 --> 01:17.190
but it's a bit early to say.'

01:17.240 --> 01:20.800
As usual, you add two and
two and make 53. Busy day?

01:20.880 --> 01:22.750
Granny's asked me to look in later.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.670
It'll be about the hospital
business. Have you told Mama?

01:25.720 --> 01:28.800
- To be honest, Granny said not to.
- You're mad if you don't.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.950
She's a trustee, she belongs there.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.230
Not all the trustees
can be at every meeting

01:33.280 --> 01:35.670
and I want to see if there
is some way to sort it out

01:35.720 --> 01:37.390
before there's blood on the carpet.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.150
- What is it?
- There's a man downstairs, My Lady.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.950
- Mr Finch is here to see the agent.
- I'll see him.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.630
I suggested that but he said

01:44.680 --> 01:47.960
he doesn't want to bother you,
or His Lordship, 'just the agent'.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.350
Wait ten minutes and show
him into the library.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.750
- Very good, My Lady.
- You'll have to manage him.

01:52.800 --> 01:56.600
I've got some errands to run and
I promised I'd meet Granny at 11.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.550
I want to be left to
manage him. It's my job.

02:00.760 --> 02:03.230
How are preparations for
the wedding coming along?

02:03.280 --> 02:04.950
Slowly but surely, My Lord.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.990
We've settled a date with Mr Travis

02:07.040 --> 02:09.750
and now we have to decide
where to hold the reception,

02:09.800 --> 02:13.160
- what there is of one. - Well,
here of course. - Absolutely.

02:13.240 --> 02:16.400
We can decorate the servants' hall
and make it look really special.

02:16.480 --> 02:21.040
That's kind, My Lord. As I say,
we haven't yet made the decision.

02:21.120 --> 02:23.190
Don't forget poor Mr Finch.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.150
Honestly, Papa, 'We'll
decorate the servants' hall'!

02:30.200 --> 02:32.710
- Surely we can do better than that.
- What do you mean?

02:32.760 --> 02:34.830
I don't want to discuss
it now. I'm in a rush.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.420
We'll have a proper conversation later.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.480
I know it's cheating, but I think
I might get a jar of horseradish.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.150
It really isn't bad now.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.190
- That's not like you.
- True.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.720
We could use it in sandwiches without
having to go through the palaver.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.070
- Can I borrow some soda,
Mrs Patmore? - Borrow?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.790
So you'll give it back (?)

02:57.840 --> 03:00.120
Any more news on Mr Mason?

03:00.200 --> 03:03.560
Only that he's losing home and
livelihood and it's all my fault.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.910
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Yes, it is, I caused it.

03:05.960 --> 03:08.710
If it weren't for my big mouth,
he might've had a reprieve.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.110
- That's not what Miss Baxter says.
- She wasn't there.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.360
Have you finished your order list?
I'll send them out this afternoon.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.680
I'll take them up to Mr Bakewell.
I'm going into the village later.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.560
That's kind. I think I'll walk
down to the Home Farm myself.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.240
I'll join you.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.030
We'll be back by 12.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.760
Right you are.

03:29.200 --> 03:31.470
I'm sorry I'm a letdown, Mr Finch.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.790
Not a letdown, milady,
I wouldn't say that,

03:33.840 --> 03:36.230
only I need to discuss the
estate's entries this year

03:36.280 --> 03:38.270
in the fat stock show at Malton.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.190
You won't want to be bothered with it.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.670
I thought all the shows
took place before Christmas?

03:42.720 --> 03:45.230
They do, usually. This is an experiment.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.430
And you've come to discuss
it with Mr Branson.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.190
I know that's not possible, milady,

03:49.240 --> 03:51.310
but if you could tell
me who's replaced him...

03:51.360 --> 03:54.150
Hold onto your hat, Mr
Finch, but I'm afraid I have.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.280
Mm-hm... Hm.

03:56.360 --> 03:57.920
I see.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.230
I've been working with
Mr Branson for some years

04:00.280 --> 04:02.870
and now I intend to manage
myself, with His Lordship.

04:02.920 --> 04:06.400
- Well... it's a changing world.
- It certainly is.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.070
We're anxious the show
shouldn't be a letdown, milady,

04:09.120 --> 04:11.710
so we're really hoping for a
decent entry from the Abbey.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.190
We did well with the pigs in
the other fat stock shows,

04:14.240 --> 04:15.990
so let me discuss it with our pig man.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.910
You see, these shows don't
have the buzz of a county show,

04:18.959 --> 04:23.160
but a decent turnout from the surviving
estates means they're taken seriously.

04:23.240 --> 04:25.150
The key word being surviving.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.800
Hm.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.120
'Decorate the servants' hall'?

04:29.200 --> 04:32.160
I'm not sure how enticing that sounds.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.720
- It was meant kindly.
- I daresay.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.590
What would you like us to do?

04:36.640 --> 04:39.580
If I'm honest, I'd like
to get away for the day.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.560
Find somewhere local, where
we can throw our own party,

04:43.640 --> 04:46.590
instead of a gathering by
courtesy of the Crawley family.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.230
You do mean to invite them?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.080
Of course I do.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.390
Why, did you think you
would have to get married

04:52.440 --> 04:54.150
without Lady Mary to witness it?

04:54.200 --> 04:57.150
She's an important figure
in my life, Mrs Hughes.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.590
- I won't apologise.
- Nor do you have to.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.960
I just don't want to be a
servant on my wedding day.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.000
Is that so wrong?

05:05.080 --> 05:06.910
What should I tell His Lordship?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.950
Tell him thank you, but no.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
(GROANS SOFTLY)

05:14.640 --> 05:16.600
This seems very formal.

05:16.680 --> 05:22.080
The Royal Yorkshire has written to
all our financial donors to canvas
their support for the takeover.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.600
- Which you'll agree is very sneaky.
- I think it's sensible.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.790
The principle benefit
of the new arrangement

05:27.840 --> 05:31.880
will be to make our money raising
activities more coherent and logical.

05:31.960 --> 05:35.080
There's no government funding
available, either to them or to us.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.520
Which means we'll become a ward
of the larger establishment,

05:38.600 --> 05:41.390
while the local community
forfeit any claims

05:41.440 --> 05:43.590
to being treated in their own village.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.230
Well, that depends how we
divide the new departments.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.360
In the end, surely, it comes down
to how many lives will be saved.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.480
- Precisely. - Lord Grantham, are
you saying we don't save lives?

05:52.560 --> 05:56.200
- No, of course not. - If you can't say
anything helpful, Robert, please be silent.

05:56.280 --> 05:59.480
- Helpful to whom? And why isn't Cora here?
- It doesn't concern her.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.870
I am the president, you are the almoner,

06:01.920 --> 06:05.000
Dr Clarkson runs the hospital
and Robert is the patron

06:05.080 --> 06:08.200
and his father gave the land
on which the hospital is built.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.760
- The four of us constitute a quorum.
- I disagree.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.150
Tell her about this
meeting and, when you do,

06:14.200 --> 06:18.040
say that Cousin Violet would have
kept the rest of us away if she could.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.080
Don't give me ideas.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.870
I suppose you've settled into
the routine by this time.

06:22.920 --> 06:24.510
I think so. I like it here.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.510
- It's quite a change from Bayswater.
- It's a change that suits me.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.350
I've been getting to know the
estate when I've got time off.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.000
- I thought I'd look at the woods.
- I'll come with you, if you like.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.830
No, you're all right. I like to
walk on my own, if I'm honest.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.990
I agree with you, Andy,
it's very liberating.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.040
If you say so.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.680
Mr Carson, I don't suppose there's any
more news on when you'll be serving notice?

06:46.760 --> 06:49.840
Nobody's going to be flung into
the road, I can assure you.

06:49.920 --> 06:54.000
No, but I mean... should I
start looking for another job?

06:54.080 --> 06:55.820
How could it hurt?

07:00.480 --> 07:04.040
At least you know you won't be asked to
leave until you've got somewhere to go.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.990
- I don't know anything of the
sort. - But you heard him. - No.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.910
What I heard is that I'm for the chop

07:08.960 --> 07:11.310
and they won't wait forever
to make it come true.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.080
(BELL RINGS)

07:20.840 --> 07:22.870
- Mr Dawes...
- Mr Molesley.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.880
.. might I have a word?

07:24.960 --> 07:27.310
There's no point in
shouting at me, Mr Skinner.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.720
I want what you want: a
magazine people like to read.

07:32.560 --> 07:34.750
I don't understand why you're so angry.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.240
I'm simply making suggestions.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.390
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.110
I will be up tomorrow, so
we can talk about it then

07:43.160 --> 07:46.440
but, please, try and keep
calm until I get there.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.280
Goodbye.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.320
(SIGHS)

07:50.400 --> 07:53.560
We should finish up. The children
will be here in a minute.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.480
- Who was it?
- Mr Skinner in his usual form.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.550
He hates my ideas for the editorial,

07:59.600 --> 08:01.790
he hates my suggestions for interviews

08:01.840 --> 08:04.430
and he hates the new
photographs we've commissioned.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.470
Sounds as if he hates running a magazine.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.950
He hates me. Let's leave it at that.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.320
I'll have to go up to London, which
is a nuisance, but there you are.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.030
How did the meeting go?

08:14.080 --> 08:16.870
Dr Clarkson wants to win your
mother over to Granny's team.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.910
- And will he?
- I don't believe so.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.790
I suppose he likes being his
own boss and who can blame him?

08:21.840 --> 08:26.080
Is that fair? It's always been a huge
plus that we have our own hospital

08:26.160 --> 08:28.990
- and he wants to retain it.
- So whose side are you on?

08:29.040 --> 08:32.440
- I wish I didn't have to decide.
- (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS)

08:32.760 --> 08:34.549
- Ah!
- Hello, my darling.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.360
How was your day?

08:36.440 --> 08:39.150
I never asked what that man
was here for this morning.

08:39.200 --> 08:42.150
Malton is holding a late
fat stock show this year.

08:42.200 --> 08:45.760
- That sounds rather small beer. Is
it worth the bother? - I think so.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.270
Two of the pigs are
proven winners after all.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.320
- I'm going to look at them tomorrow.
- Can we come? - I don't see why not.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.360
I'll tell Nanny.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.830
You want to take them to the Drewes' farm?

08:56.880 --> 08:58.870
You can come with us if you like.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.280
But is it a good idea? Is it safe?

09:02.360 --> 09:04.990
Don't be such a ninny. I've
said you can come if you want.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.990
It'll be nice for them to see Marigold.

09:07.040 --> 09:09.030
But I have to be in London now.

09:09.080 --> 09:11.640
I'll go.

09:11.720 --> 09:13.550
- I'm sure it'll be fine.
- How exciting!

09:13.600 --> 09:16.600
We'll all look at the
pigs, then we'll come home.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.910
- Are you on your own?
- Looks like it.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.750
Cos I've got something for you.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.790
Oh, yes? What's that, then?

09:31.840 --> 09:33.910
You know I went into the village earlier?

09:33.960 --> 09:36.630
- I looked in at the school,
while I was there. - Go on...

09:36.680 --> 09:39.070
I spoke to the headmaster
about your examination.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.430
Well, about examinations
in general, really.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.440
Anyway...

09:43.520 --> 09:46.280
He suggested, before we fix a date,

09:46.360 --> 09:50.800
you might like a go at some old
papers from the last few years.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.470
You mean real exams that people sat?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.110
- That was kind of you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

09:58.160 --> 10:02.280
He took me through them. In fact,
it was really rather interesting.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.310
I just wish Mr Mason was settled.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.350
If you passed your exams, you'd
be in a better place to help him.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.190
Maybe, but first, I've
got to make them listen.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.160
Her Ladyship was there and she
tried to calm the new owner down,

10:15.240 --> 10:18.280
- so she must be sympathetic.
- Daisy, we're servants.

10:18.360 --> 10:20.360
I have to do something.

10:24.520 --> 10:26.480
Is anything the matter?

10:26.560 --> 10:28.560
No.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.670
I mean, you're free.

10:31.720 --> 10:34.480
Bates is free, the threat's gone away.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.520
I'd expect you to be wreathed in smiles

10:37.600 --> 10:40.200
but, instead, you seem rather cast down.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.110
Life's never simple is it, milady?

10:43.160 --> 10:46.100
You don't have to tell
me, if you don't want to.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.800
It's almost funny really, given the
service I once performed for you.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.600
You know Mr Bates and I have
always wanted children...?

10:56.680 --> 10:59.080
And you'll have some now, I'm sure.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.320
No, I won't.

11:03.520 --> 11:05.480
It seems I can't.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.200
Anna, no woman living

11:09.280 --> 11:12.720
has been put through more of
an emotional wringer than you.

11:12.800 --> 11:15.920
It doesn't surprise me in the least
that you haven't got pregnant.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.800
That's the point, I can get
pregnant, I just can't keep it.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.150
And how many times has this happened?

11:22.200 --> 11:24.280
Two, maybe three.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.800
Well, I still say your life has been
so filled with stress and worry...

11:29.880 --> 11:31.840
It's all right, milady.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.880
I'm used to the idea.

11:33.960 --> 11:37.060
Some women can't have
children and I'm one of them.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.150
Now, if that will be all...

11:40.200 --> 11:42.200
Yes, thank you.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.800
(DOOR CLOSES)

12:00.300 --> 12:02.060
Hello.

12:02.140 --> 12:04.130
- Do you post your own letters?
- Ha!

12:04.180 --> 12:08.140
It was vital it went off today and
I'm never very good at delegating.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.770
As a matter of fact, I'm glad to see you.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.780
I'd value your advice.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.850
I've had a letter from the
Royal Yorkshire Hospital,

12:16.900 --> 12:19.850
asking if I'd head the new
Board of Charitable Donors.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.890
We'd be working alongside.

12:21.940 --> 12:25.380
Well, that's if I stay the
almoner, once we've amalgamated.

12:25.460 --> 12:29.500
Well, of course you would. When we combine,
we'll avoid duplicating our efforts.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.700
The whole thing would work a lot
more efficiently than it does now.

12:32.780 --> 12:34.850
So you don't disagree with the plan?

12:34.900 --> 12:36.930
Well, don't you see what it could mean?

12:36.980 --> 12:39.090
How old is our X-ray machine?

12:39.140 --> 12:41.490
Does Clarkson really know how to use it?

12:41.540 --> 12:44.580
What advanced surgery do we offer? None.

12:45.620 --> 12:48.370
If a family at the Abbey has a
cut finger, they go to London,

12:48.420 --> 12:51.660
- but what about everyone else? - I bet
you'd go to London too. - (CHUCKLES)

12:51.740 --> 12:54.410
I probably would, but I shouldn't have to.

12:54.460 --> 12:57.210
And what about people who
don't have that option?

12:57.260 --> 13:00.660
So the battle lines are drawn
and now we must fight it out.

13:00.740 --> 13:03.080
Well, I'm glad we're to be allies.

13:03.740 --> 13:05.370
I must be going.

13:05.420 --> 13:08.660
I assume old Lady Grantham
is still bitterly opposed?

13:08.740 --> 13:13.020
Of course, so there'll be wigs
on the green before we're done.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.440
So be it. Wigs on the green it is.

13:22.420 --> 13:26.060
Poor Daisy's in a terrible state
about Mr Mason losing his farm.

13:26.140 --> 13:29.380
I don't blame her, it's a beautiful
place and he's a lovely man.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.540
She seems to think that Her
Ladyship might want to help.

13:32.620 --> 13:35.980
I don't see how. I mean, they like
Mr Mason, but what can they do?

13:36.060 --> 13:39.660
The way she talks, they didn't
much take to the new owners.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.490
But do you think you could ask?

13:43.540 --> 13:46.660
I can tell her Daisy's worried,
but I can't do more than that.

13:46.740 --> 13:49.220
Very well. I'd better get on.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.130
- I shouldn't get involved.
- No.

13:54.180 --> 13:57.340
And you don't like to get
involved in helping others, do you?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.360
I'm trying to help you.

14:00.740 --> 14:03.250
- Anything interesting?
- Is this interesting?

14:03.300 --> 14:06.580
'Assistant butler, varied
duties, start at once.'

14:06.660 --> 14:08.450
- Then there's a Ripon number.
- Oh.

14:08.500 --> 14:12.020
- It would be nice if you didn't have
to move far away. - Nice for whom?

14:12.100 --> 14:15.860
You won't let me be fond of you,
will you? No matter what I do.

14:15.940 --> 14:19.820
- Did I leave a tin of oil in here?
- I put it on the mantelpiece. - Oh.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.660
Mr Carson wants me to wind the clocks.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.980
I've an idea the one in the tapestry
room needs extra loving care.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.290
I used to wind the clocks.
Do you want some help?

14:28.340 --> 14:32.020
Don't worry, Mr Barrow, I looked
after the clocks in my last place.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.050
What's an assistant butler
when it's at home, anyway?

14:39.100 --> 14:41.090
That's what I'd like to know.

14:41.140 --> 14:43.140
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:48.020 --> 14:51.420
- Well, they're big enough.
- They're good animals, milady.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.770
They've done well and
they will again at Malton.

14:53.820 --> 14:55.530
Hey, Miss Marigold!

14:55.580 --> 14:58.340
Does Lady Edith know you're here?

14:58.420 --> 15:00.890
She would've come herself,
but she's in London.

15:00.940 --> 15:04.540
- So you're happy to enter them
for the show? - Very happy.

15:04.620 --> 15:08.220
- Where's Mrs Drewe? - She's gone
into town, but she'll be back soon.

15:09.420 --> 15:12.130
- We should probably get home.
- Well, there's no great rush.

15:12.180 --> 15:15.050
- Won't Mrs Drewe want to see
Marigold? - Well -- - Yes, I would.

15:15.100 --> 15:17.140
It's kind of you, milady.

15:18.780 --> 15:20.740
I'd love to look at her.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.420
Hello.

15:25.260 --> 15:28.740
- Do you remember me? - Of course she
remembers you, don't you, darling?

15:28.820 --> 15:32.420
It's been so nice, but I think we ought
to get them back for their luncheon.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.900
Back to the big house for luncheon.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.340
Let her go, Margie.

15:43.460 --> 15:45.420
We mustn't hold them up.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.060
(BOTH LAUGH)

15:47.140 --> 15:50.540
That's it, my love, you come
with me, back to your auntie.

15:50.620 --> 15:54.820
Good, well, I'll send a note
to Mr Finch in the afternoon.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.900
Thank you, Mr Drewe.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.820
(I hope that's the last
time anyone calls me Auntie.)

16:04.060 --> 16:06.060
Right, back to work.

16:10.340 --> 16:12.020
Mr Carson?

16:12.100 --> 16:16.860
I wonder if I could have some time
off, this afternoon, for an interview?

16:16.940 --> 16:18.930
Interview? What, for a job?

16:18.980 --> 16:22.260
Yes, it's quite local --
Rothley Manor near Ripon.

16:22.340 --> 16:25.420
I telephoned and they
said to look in today.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.010
You don't let the grass grow, I must say.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.980
- So I can go?
- Be my guest.

16:31.060 --> 16:33.060
Thank you, Mr Carson.

16:35.340 --> 16:37.300
Good luck.

16:37.380 --> 16:39.920
If I was lucky, I wouldn't be leaving.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.530
- Did the children like the pigs?
- They loved them.

16:43.580 --> 16:45.730
Drewe was as proud as
punch showing them off.

16:45.780 --> 16:48.860
- Was Mrs Drewe there?
- She came just before we left

16:48.940 --> 16:51.570
and she enjoyed seeing
Marigold, didn't she, Mama?

16:51.620 --> 16:55.180
- She was quite overcome.
- Yes, I think she was very pleased.

16:55.260 --> 16:56.980
Is that luncheon?

16:58.180 --> 17:02.100
Carson, when Papa offered to
decorate the servants' hall,

17:02.180 --> 17:04.170
he wasn't really thinking.

17:04.220 --> 17:07.660
If you'd like your reception to be
here, we can hold it in the hall,

17:07.740 --> 17:09.369
or whichever room you choose.

17:09.420 --> 17:11.210
That's very kind of you, My Lady.

17:11.260 --> 17:14.010
Not a bit, we'd be
delighted, wouldn't we, Papa?

17:14.060 --> 17:16.170
But you must feel free to refuse.

17:16.220 --> 17:18.210
Oh, there's not much chance of that.

17:18.260 --> 17:21.210
- Speak to Mrs Hughes, she may
feel differently. - Why should she?

17:21.260 --> 17:24.859
She just may, that's all, it's
her wedding. Shall we go in?

17:27.339 --> 17:30.540
Of course, I'd have been very happy
in the servants' hall, My Lord...

17:30.620 --> 17:33.370
Don't worry, Carson, there's
no point even pretending

17:33.420 --> 17:36.700
that we can argue with
Lady Mary, either of us.

17:39.060 --> 17:41.060
(WEEPS)

17:45.420 --> 17:47.410

- This isn't right.

17:47.460 --> 17:49.690
- Give me a moment, I'll be fine. - No.

17:49.740 --> 17:52.130
I mean, it's not right
for you to cry alone.

17:52.180 --> 17:56.100
You're married and that means you
never have to cry alone again.

17:57.340 --> 17:59.020
(SNIFFS)

17:59.100 --> 18:01.240
I told Lady Mary last night.

18:02.380 --> 18:05.380
She was kind, of course, but
it just brought it all back.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.900
Have you ever thought about adoption?

18:13.060 --> 18:16.620
Yes, but... I don't believe
it would work for you.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.490
You're tribal, Mr Bates,

18:19.540 --> 18:22.340
and the tribe doesn't
have a lot of members.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.900
You want your own child.
No substitute will do.

18:25.980 --> 18:27.980
But what do YOU want?

18:29.060 --> 18:32.740
See. You gave yourself
away by not denying it.

18:35.020 --> 18:37.620
We must learn to be content as we are...

18:38.580 --> 18:40.210
.. which is easy for me.

18:40.260 --> 18:43.820
But it's my fault, not yours, that
I can't give you what you need.

18:43.900 --> 18:48.780
To me, we are one person and
that person can't have children.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.700
(SNIFFS)

18:53.780 --> 18:55.780
I love you.

18:57.140 --> 19:00.140
Of course I understand you
may have read many magazines

19:00.220 --> 19:03.130
whilst having your hair done
or waiting for the dentist,

19:03.180 --> 19:06.460
but that does not mean you're an
expert in how to produce them!

19:06.540 --> 19:08.930
You know, there is no need
to shout, I am not deaf.

19:08.980 --> 19:10.770
Oh, really? Are you sure?

19:10.820 --> 19:14.140
Because you seem to have such
difficulty in hearing what I am saying.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.050
- It's drier than they said it
would be in the newspapers. - Yes.

19:17.100 --> 19:19.300
It's brightening up, isn't it?

19:21.180 --> 19:23.570
- Let's go. - We'll have lunch
and then you can come back.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.620
There's no point.

19:27.980 --> 19:31.220
- What a terrible man.
- He didn't sound very conciliatory.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.340
The truth is, I've come up to
London to have my nose bitten off

19:34.420 --> 19:36.180
and that's not all.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.780
Mama telephoned. Mary took
Marigold to the Drewes' farm today.

19:39.860 --> 19:42.530
- I knew she was planning it.
- Well, why didn't you stop her?

19:42.580 --> 19:45.460
Well, how? George was
aching to see the pigs

19:45.540 --> 19:48.410
and what possible reason could
I give for stopping Marigold?

19:48.460 --> 19:50.850
Well, you could've said
it would upset Mrs Drewe.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.810
Wouldn't Mary have wondered why
I was making such a thing of it?

19:53.860 --> 19:57.660
- You're going to have to tell her one day.
- I don't see why.

19:58.260 --> 20:01.260
- How's Granny?
- Embarking on a civil war.

20:01.340 --> 20:04.250
They want to change the way
they run the local hospital.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.290
Change? Mama won't like that.

20:06.340 --> 20:09.460
She's in one camp with Dr
Clarkson, who isn't a fan either,

20:09.540 --> 20:11.730
- and Isobel's in the other.
- And your parents?

20:11.780 --> 20:15.260
Mama agrees with Isobel. Papa
doesn't want to take sides.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.880
Well, if I know Granny, he'll have to.

20:31.580 --> 20:34.090
So you're under butler at Downton Abbey.

20:34.140 --> 20:35.850
Yes, I've been there for a long time.

20:35.900 --> 20:39.020
I first arrived as a junior
footman about 15 years ago.

20:39.100 --> 20:41.090
- Another world.
- So it seems.

20:41.140 --> 20:44.180
Of course, I was away at the
war in the middle of that.

20:44.260 --> 20:47.700
- Why are you leaving now?
- It seems like the right time for a move.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.940
Does it? Does it, indeed?

20:51.020 --> 20:54.980
Tell me, Mr Moore, what exactly
is an assistant butler?

20:55.060 --> 20:56.850
I'm not familiar with the term.

20:56.900 --> 20:58.570
No, well, we made it up.

20:58.620 --> 21:02.340
Ah, so the duties of an assistant butler
are not the same as an under butler.

21:02.420 --> 21:05.580
I think you have to climb down
from that high horse, Mr Barrow.

21:05.660 --> 21:07.340
This is 1925.

21:07.420 --> 21:11.660
We'd need you to combine the duties of a
footman -- when needed -- and a chauffeur.

21:11.740 --> 21:14.940
- There's no chauffeur?
- Well, they drive themselves most of the time

21:15.020 --> 21:19.500
but, should they need a chauffeur for
evening parties and the like, that'd be you.

21:19.580 --> 21:23.100
I see. Well, I can drive, just about.

21:24.140 --> 21:26.330
- Is that all?
- Do you know how to valet?

21:26.380 --> 21:28.890
Goodness, this is a job
for a one-man band.

21:28.940 --> 21:31.780
You're a delicate-looking
fella, aren't you?

21:31.860 --> 21:33.700
I wouldn't say that.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.410
- Are you married?
- No.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.860
Why would that be? Did the
right girl never come along?

21:39.100 --> 21:42.460
I think you know that not many
footmen or butlers are married.

21:42.540 --> 21:46.020
Well, they didn't used to be. But I am.

21:47.380 --> 21:51.020
All right, Mr Barrow, I've got
enough. We'll let you know.

21:53.660 --> 21:57.180
- How did the visit go? - Well, George
wants to be a pig farmer when he grows up.

21:58.780 --> 22:02.140
- And Mr Drewe's well?
- He's so proud of his animals.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.300
Was Mrs Drewe there?

22:04.380 --> 22:06.380
You're full of questions.

22:07.420 --> 22:10.900
To be honest, she was quite
upset at seeing Marigold again.

22:10.980 --> 22:13.130
I thought it would be a nice gesture

22:13.180 --> 22:15.210
but, perhaps, I was being insensitive.

22:15.260 --> 22:18.420
When a woman loves a child,
it must stay with her.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.500
I suppose so.

22:22.340 --> 22:24.300
That reminds me...

22:24.380 --> 22:27.100
You know what you told me, last night?

22:27.180 --> 22:28.780
Yes.

22:30.060 --> 22:32.130
I want you to let me help.

22:33.620 --> 22:37.260
That's so nice, milady, thank you,
but there's nothing to be done --

22:37.340 --> 22:40.420
That's not true. Well,
that's not necessarily true.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.900
I think you've forgotten that,
when I was first married,

22:43.980 --> 22:46.530
- I couldn't get pregnant, either --
- Yes, but you see, I --

22:46.580 --> 22:49.490
Listen. So I went to a
Dr Ryder in Harley Street.

22:49.540 --> 22:53.980
He found I needed a tiny operation,
I had it and George is the result.

22:54.060 --> 22:58.340
- I don't think there's any point --
- There's no point in thinking, you don't know.

22:58.420 --> 23:02.580
I'm going to take you up to London, we'll
meet Dr Ryder and listen to what he has to say.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.170
- Then we'll see.
- But what would that cost?

23:05.220 --> 23:07.210
I couldn't accept it from you.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.530
Don't be silly, you've
earned it fair and square,

23:09.580 --> 23:13.340
keeping my secrets, hiding
that fearful Dutch thingamajig,

23:13.420 --> 23:16.410
carrying poor Mr Pamuk down the
gallery in the dead of night.

23:16.460 --> 23:18.420
(GIGGLES)

23:18.500 --> 23:21.050
We have had our moments
haven't we, milady?

23:21.100 --> 23:24.780
We certainly have. And
this is our next moment.

23:24.860 --> 23:27.420
I'll telephone and make an appointment.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.540
I do appreciate it.

23:31.580 --> 23:34.180
It won't work, but that's not the point.

23:35.260 --> 23:38.210
Nobody in my whole life has
been kinder to me than you have.

23:38.260 --> 23:41.460
- Except for Mr Bates.
- Except for Mr Bates.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.580
I'm glad that's settled.

23:44.660 --> 23:47.260
- Will you tell him?
- Not yet.

23:47.340 --> 23:50.820
He'd hope too much. But later,
if anything comes of it.

23:53.380 --> 23:58.500
But how? I'd be surprised if Mr Henderson was
particularly anxious to renew our acquaintance.

23:58.580 --> 24:00.850
Couldn't Sir John Darnley
put in a good word?

24:00.900 --> 24:04.340
I'm sure, but the new owners
won't take orders from him.

24:04.420 --> 24:07.410
Now that it is theirs,
they'll do as they think fit.

24:07.460 --> 24:09.570
So I'll tell Daisy not
to speak to you about it.

24:09.620 --> 24:12.980
I don't like anyone to feel they
can't approach me if they want to,

24:13.060 --> 24:15.330
- (DOOR OPENS)
- but I'm not convinced I can help.

24:15.380 --> 24:18.100
- Whom can't you help?
- Mr Mason.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.580
- I don't think I can.
- No.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.860
(DOOR CLOSES)

24:24.940 --> 24:28.220
What were you not saying about
your visit to the Drewes'?

24:28.300 --> 24:32.500
Only that Mrs Drewe has
definitely not got over Marigold.

24:32.580 --> 24:36.180
- No? - No. She looked as if
she wanted to swallow her whole.

24:36.260 --> 24:39.170
Well, how clever was it to take the
child there in the first place?

24:39.220 --> 24:42.820
Mary made the plan. There
was no way to cancel it.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.890
I wish Edith would just tell her.

24:44.940 --> 24:49.180
Oh, she thinks Mary would use it
as a weapon and she may be right.

24:50.700 --> 24:54.020
If only the Drewes would move
away and find a tenancy elsewhere.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.010
Why would they? They've been at
Yew Tree for more than a century.

24:57.060 --> 25:00.580
That woman will not forget Marigold
while the girl is under her nose.

25:00.660 --> 25:04.980
I don't mind talking to Drewe,
but I doubt it will do much good.

25:13.240 --> 25:15.910
- Did the interview go well?
- Not very.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.110
Never mind. Something will turn up.

25:19.160 --> 25:20.790
But not this one.

25:20.840 --> 25:24.760
They wanted me to be a chauffeur,
a footman and a valet combined.

25:24.840 --> 25:28.240
For all I know, I'd have to cook and
do the garden into the bargain (!)

25:28.320 --> 25:30.910
I suppose none of that was
reflected in the money.

25:30.960 --> 25:35.640
Was it heck as like? They pay for
one servant and they want a whole
bleeding household thrown in.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.120
(SIGHS)

25:38.160 --> 25:41.160
- I don't understand why you bother with him.
- I know you don't.

25:42.360 --> 25:45.070
- So I can't speak to Her Ladyship?
- She didn't say that,

25:45.120 --> 25:47.270
she just said she didn't
think she could help.

25:47.320 --> 25:51.480
I'd like to hear it from her lips, or I'll feel
I've done nothing, except make things worse.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.230
- Well, then, ask her.
- But don't be angry with her.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.870
It's not Her Ladyship's fault.

25:55.920 --> 25:58.150
Maybe not, but it's the system's fault.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.520
That's what makes me angry -- the
system -- and she's part of it.

26:10.920 --> 26:14.240
I do not understand why any
form of compromise is beyond him.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.910
You wanted a strong editor.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.280
But I didn't want to find myself
in a bull ring with Attila the Hun.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.560
(CHUCKLES) Thank you, William.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.200
- Oh... Mary's coming tomorrow.
- What does she want?

26:32.280 --> 26:35.400
She has an appointment in Harley
Street and she needs some clothes.

26:35.480 --> 26:37.510
I ought to do some
shopping while I'm here.

26:37.560 --> 26:39.390
I haven't had anything new in ages.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.880
- Why not go shopping together?
- With Mary? Not likely.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.630
- That was a delicious dinner.
- Oh, I have a new cook.

26:46.680 --> 26:51.080
She won't stay -- the good ones never do,
but we shall eat well until she goes.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.790
What have you decided
to do about your flat?

26:54.840 --> 26:58.480
I think I'm going to keep it empty
and see if I get any use out of it.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.630
- Why aren't you there now?
- I should be.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.600
I suppose the truth is
I've never lived alone

27:03.680 --> 27:05.990
and I'm not convinced
I'll be much good at it.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.030
Beware of being too good at it.

27:08.080 --> 27:12.680
That's the danger of living alone
-- it can be very hard to give up.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.600
It's not that I'm ungrateful, I am
grateful, I think it's very kind.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.710
But you don't want to accept?

27:20.760 --> 27:23.040
This is a beautiful house

27:23.120 --> 27:26.440
and whether we're in the great hall
or the drawing room, or wherever,

27:26.520 --> 27:28.510
it would all be very splendid.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.520
- So what's the problem?
- It's not us.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.880
It's not who we are.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.910
It may be where we work,
but it is not who we are.

27:36.960 --> 27:39.680
While being in the school house would be?

27:39.760 --> 27:42.670
It doesn't have to be the school
house, if you don't like it.

27:42.720 --> 27:47.600
But, yes, if we take a neutral place
and decorate it the way we want

27:47.680 --> 27:51.760
and put in the flowers we
like, it would be about us

27:51.840 --> 27:54.840
in a way the great hall of
Downton Abbey never can be.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.520
(SIGHS)

27:56.600 --> 27:59.080
And I have to tell His Lordship.

27:59.160 --> 28:01.360
I will, if you don't want to.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.560
No, no, I'll do it. It should be me.

28:09.040 --> 28:10.630
Do you know when you'll be back?

28:10.680 --> 28:12.670
Tomorrow, or the next day, I expect.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.310
What does she have planned?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.360
Oh, you know, some shopping,
one or two appointments.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.230
Well, try and put your feet up.

28:21.640 --> 28:23.910
Yes, I'll be putting my feet up.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.430
I think a bit of a break will do you good

28:27.480 --> 28:29.960
and give my regards to Mr Mead.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.920
You're right, it may do me good.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.140
It won't do any harm, anyway.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.830
To what do we owe this honour?

28:48.880 --> 28:50.870
I must look in at the church

28:50.920 --> 28:54.560
and I'm seeing Dr Clarkson and
Mama at the hospital later on.

28:54.640 --> 28:57.630
I've mentioned it to Isobel,
so I hope she's there too.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.080
- Is that wise?
- I think so.

29:00.160 --> 29:04.560
At least she's an ally I can rely
on, even if I can't rely on you.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.960
- I didn't tell you about the m - What
time's your train? - Half-past nine.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.920
- Bags of time. - Carson, have
you broken the news to Mrs Hughes?

29:12.000 --> 29:15.160
- What news is this?
- Where they're having the wedding reception.

29:15.240 --> 29:19.240
- I hope she's pleased. - To be honest,
My Lady, she's a little hesitant.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.150
She's not quite convinced
that it would be appropriate.

29:22.200 --> 29:26.840
- Why not? - She feels we would be
making a claim to which we have no right.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.200
Carson, you've worked in this house
man and boy for half a century.

29:30.280 --> 29:32.950
If you've no right to be married
from here, then who does?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.870
- Mrs Hughes sees it differently.
- You leave Mrs Hughes to me.

29:35.920 --> 29:39.960
Don't worry, Carson, your reception will be
in the great hall if it's the last thing I do.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.200
How reassuring, My Lady.

29:42.280 --> 29:44.280
How very reassuring.

29:45.600 --> 29:49.200
We wanted you to see the
ward now it's been repainted.

29:49.280 --> 29:52.200
- It's much brighter, isn't it?
- Very nice.

29:52.280 --> 29:53.960
Doctor?

29:54.040 --> 29:56.030
He's done this with me, my dear.

29:56.080 --> 29:59.070
Now you'll be paraded past
every element of treatment:

29:59.120 --> 30:01.350
surgical, palliative, you name it.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.390
Oh? And what are you trying to add?

30:03.440 --> 30:05.670
I don't want Cousin
Cora to feel outnumbered.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.670
It isn't friendly, you know,
to stir her up into opposition.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.630
It's not very friendly to squash
her into submission either.

30:11.680 --> 30:14.350
Excuse me, but I don't need
to be stirred or squashed.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.990
- The facts speak for themselves.
- Your facts or mine?

30:17.040 --> 30:20.040
- What's the difference?
- Mine are the true facts.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.590
Shall we continue this in my office?

30:29.720 --> 30:33.360
I wish we could persuade you to
help us stem the tide of change.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.880
I'm just not convinced it's the
right way forward, to go backward.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.950
I do not understand you, my dear.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.520
- Are you saying Dr Clarkson is
a bad doctor? - Certainly not.

30:42.600 --> 30:46.040
And the other doctors that use our
hospital -- are they no good either?

30:46.120 --> 30:48.150
I'm sure everyone does their very best,

30:48.200 --> 30:51.190
but there are new methods now,
new treatments, new machines.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.430
Great advances have
been made since the war.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.390
- Can't we share in them?
- Hear, hear.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.630
Of course. I intend that we should.

30:57.680 --> 31:01.000
- We haven't got the money.
- I see I'm not needed to lend you strength.

31:01.080 --> 31:02.990
You're fully in command of the argument.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.240
Have you no pride in what we
have achieved with our hospital?

31:06.320 --> 31:08.310
I don't think pride comes into it.

31:08.360 --> 31:11.680
Well, I warn you, Dr Clarkson and
I will fight to the last ditch.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.030
I just want what's best for the village.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.070
Well, at least we have that in common.

31:16.120 --> 31:18.760
I must go. Mama, Isobel...

31:18.840 --> 31:20.800
I'll come with you.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.980
We must give them time to
gnash their teeth alone.

31:27.640 --> 31:31.000
I can't deny it, Lady Grantham
would've made a powerful ally.

31:31.080 --> 31:35.360
I hope you're not implying that
she would be more powerful than I.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.440
- Oh, no, indeed.
- Mm.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.950
- Are you ordering me to leave?
- Of course not,

31:41.000 --> 31:43.590
but the fact remains, this
is a difficult situation.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.800
Why did they bring her here?
Why didn't Lady Edith stop it?

31:46.880 --> 31:48.950
She couldn't, she was away.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.630
Where's Mrs Drewe now?

31:51.680 --> 31:53.870
She's collecting the children from school.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.920
We're all right.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.070
I wish we were all right.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.110
Nobody wishes it more than I do,

32:01.160 --> 32:07.280
but Her Ladyship worries that Mrs Drewe
simply cannot stand being so near the child.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.110
Don't push us out, milord.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.070
We've been here since before Waterloo.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.390
I'm not pushing anyone anywhere.

32:18.320 --> 32:21.960
I want Lady Edith to be happy and
I want Miss Marigold to be happy

32:22.040 --> 32:25.030
and as a matter of fact, I would
like your wife to be happy too.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.160
I can manage her, I promise.

32:28.240 --> 32:31.720
- Very well, if you're sure you can.
- I am sure.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.940
Then we'll leave it at that.

32:41.040 --> 32:43.040
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

32:48.200 --> 32:50.680
Did you manage to raise the subject?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.750
His Lordship brought it up.

32:52.800 --> 32:55.270
How did he take it when you refused?

32:57.280 --> 32:59.550
Oh. You didn't refuse, did you?

32:59.600 --> 33:01.560
It was difficult.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.640
Lady Mary feels... that it's only right

33:04.720 --> 33:07.190
that my marriage is
celebrated in the house.

33:07.240 --> 33:12.320
And heaven forfend we lowly folk should do
anything to contradict the blessed Lady Mary!

33:12.400 --> 33:15.440
- That's not like you.
- It is very like me.

33:16.480 --> 33:19.560
I want my own wedding to
be done in my own way.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.550
- Is that so outlandish?
- It's my wedding too.

33:22.600 --> 33:26.320
But I am the bride, we'll be doing
it your way for the next 30 years,

33:26.400 --> 33:29.600
I know that well enough,
but the wedding day is mine.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.440
(DOOR OPENS)

33:42.520 --> 33:45.960
- What is it? - Your Ladyship,
might Daisy have a word with you?

33:46.040 --> 33:48.400
- Now?
- She's just outside.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.280
Very well.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.430
Thank you for seeing me, milady.

33:56.480 --> 33:59.430
I'm happy to, Daisy, but I
must tell you right off,

33:59.480 --> 34:02.880
- there's nothing more I can do.
- I just can't bear it

34:02.960 --> 34:07.440
for our William's dad to be thrown out
of his farm when it's all my fault.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.750
To start with, I don't
think it is your fault.

34:09.800 --> 34:13.239
Mr Henderson was angry, but he
wouldn't change his plans for that

34:13.320 --> 34:17.239
and the truth is, they are taking
a lot of the estate in hand.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.960
But Mr Mason's not young and
it needs someone that knows him.

34:21.040 --> 34:24.400
I'm sure he has a fine reputation
and Sir John Darnley will help.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.190
He's got all the dead stock,
with everything in top shape.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.310
Any estate would be lucky to have him.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.840
And he'd be happy to start
anew? It's a big undertaking.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.560
Why?

34:34.639 --> 34:36.429
Have you thought of something?

34:36.480 --> 34:39.429
- You've had an idea, haven't you?
- Probably not.

34:39.480 --> 34:41.159
Well, maybe.

34:41.239 --> 34:43.270
I'll let you know if anything comes of it.

34:43.320 --> 34:45.320
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

34:50.239 --> 34:54.000
It's no mystery, Mrs Bates, you
suffer from cervical incompetence.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.190
To put it plainly, the
neck of the womb is weak

34:56.239 --> 34:58.430
and as the foetus reaches
three or four months,

34:58.480 --> 35:00.350
it becomes too heavy to be supported.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.270
- So it's not unusual?
- It's bad luck, but not unusual.

35:03.320 --> 35:05.470
- And you can treat it?
- Certainly.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.670
The procedure is called cervical cerclage.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.190
- It's been in use for more
than 20 years. - Go on.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.800
I would insert a stitch, quite a
large one, in the neck of the womb.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.870
- Is it painful?
- It's quite quick.

35:15.920 --> 35:19.080
- But it works? - I'm afraid I
can't make a blanket promise.

35:19.160 --> 35:21.120
It works in many cases.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.070
- And when would you do it?
- At about 12 weeks.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.710
I'd normally come to your
house and perform it there,

35:26.760 --> 35:29.710
then you can rest afterwards
without the nuisance of travel.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.260
- I wouldn't go to hospital?
- Oh, no, it's not worth it.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.920
Well, you've given me a lot
to think about, Doctor.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.840
Thank you.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.350
- When do you return north?
- In the morning.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.480
Then I leave it to you to get in touch if and
when you next become pregnant, Mrs Bates.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.430
I'm afraid Drewe won't leave.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.470
I can't pretend I really blame him.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.470
But I don't believe the
problem will go away either.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.510
Edith telephoned before I came up.

35:56.560 --> 35:59.720
It seems her editor continues
to be a nightmare too.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.390
Did she say when she's coming back?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.520
She and Mary are catching the
same train tomorrow, 11 o'clock.

36:04.600 --> 36:07.640
Travelling together? Heavens to Betsy!

36:08.880 --> 36:10.990
But I'm glad Mary's coming straight back.

36:11.040 --> 36:14.120
As it is, she'll only have two days
to get the pigs ready for the show.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.400
Don't worry, it's only a fat stock
show and they're pretty low-key.

36:17.480 --> 36:19.510
Two days is more than enough.

36:19.560 --> 36:21.550
Still, I'm glad she's doing it.

36:21.600 --> 36:25.440
These things remind the farming community
that we're all on the same side.

36:25.520 --> 36:28.880
I wish we could remind your mother
that we're on the same side.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.070
I don't think the rule applies to Mama.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.220
- She's a law unto herself.
- And don't we know it?

36:37.360 --> 36:38.950
Is there more sugar?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.990
Here, pop one in there for us.

36:41.040 --> 36:44.880
Right, as you're all aware, this
is the day of the Malton show.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.950
There'll be no upstairs luncheon

36:47.000 --> 36:49.550
and you're all free to
visit the show if you wish.

36:49.600 --> 36:52.150
The wagonette will leave
from the stable yard at ten.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.640
- Is there a lunch we're serving at?
- No, they're guests of Lord Mexborough.

36:55.720 --> 36:58.510
I don't think I'll bother. It's
only a muddy, little affair.

36:58.560 --> 37:02.360
- Oh, no, you should come. I think
it'll be fun. - (BELL RINGS)

37:04.080 --> 37:06.040
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

37:06.120 --> 37:07.790
You're full of the joys of spring.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.910
- Am I?
- I was right about London.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.400
- You've been very bouncy since you
got back. It did you good. - It did.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.230
Now let me get on. I'll see you
down here, just before ten.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.590
- How long can we stay there?
- Good question.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.070
I must have a staff to serve
tea in case they want it.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.030
- I could do that.
- I don't think so.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.240
Andrew, Mr Molesley, make sure
you're here by a quarter-past four.

37:26.320 --> 37:27.990
Then when do you need me, Mr Carson?

37:28.040 --> 37:30.040
When indeed?

37:40.840 --> 37:42.840
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

37:47.160 --> 37:49.750
- How are they doing today?
- Fine fettle, milady.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.800
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

37:54.120 --> 37:56.720
- Moo! - Look at that cow. - Moo!

38:01.240 --> 38:04.320
- You made it, then? - Did you
think I wouldn't? - (CHUCKLES)

38:09.040 --> 38:11.030
Oh, they're all here, then.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.350
You knew they would be. Come on.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.320
Never mind. Do you want to see
Lady Mary showing off her pigs?

38:21.400 --> 38:23.400
In a minute.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.190
- (GIGGLES)
- Here, let me show you.

38:27.240 --> 38:29.590
Don't worry, Mr Barrow. It's not my game.

38:29.640 --> 38:32.580
I'd better go. I don't
want to miss those pigs.

38:33.280 --> 38:35.750
(SIGHS) You're not a
quick learner, are you?

38:35.800 --> 38:37.830
I don't know what you mean, Mrs Patmore.

38:37.880 --> 38:41.760
I'm only thinking of you. Just
be sensible, for heaven's sake.

38:41.840 --> 38:46.040
Does it ever occur to you that,
just this once, you might be wrong?

38:49.080 --> 38:50.680
(CHEERING)

38:50.760 --> 38:53.270
Well done, milady. You look
as if you're born to it.

38:53.320 --> 38:56.760
Not a compliment to everyone's
taste, Mr Finch, but it is to mine.

38:56.840 --> 38:59.630
It's funny to see Lady Mary
in there with the pigs.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.270
I think it does her proud.

39:01.320 --> 39:04.960
I agree. People might think she's
a pretend farmer, but she's not.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.560
- I hope things are beginning to settle
down for you, Mr Mason. - Settle down?

39:08.640 --> 39:11.550
- They're beginning to break
apart, more like. - Don't say it.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.720
Only poor Daisy can hardly work,
she's been so worried about you.

39:14.800 --> 39:18.100
Nae, Daisy, you can't let
worry put you off your work.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.760
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

39:30.560 --> 39:33.160
Brava. You look very convincing.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.070
- My god-daughter, the pig breeder.
- So good of you to come.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.510
One of my tenants has an
entry, I came to support him,

39:38.560 --> 39:40.550
so you're a bonus, my dear.

39:40.600 --> 39:44.240
Mama says you're on her side
for the battle of the hospitals.

39:44.320 --> 39:46.310
Well, I believe in the changes, yes.

39:46.360 --> 39:50.080
Naturally, Granny blames Isobel for
drawing you over to the dark side.

39:50.160 --> 39:52.910
Oh, no, no, no. I was
on the dark side anyway.

39:52.960 --> 39:56.400
Oh! I was rather hoping it might
be the first signs of a thaw.

39:56.480 --> 40:00.360
How I wish that were true but, I'm
afraid, her mind remains made up.

40:00.440 --> 40:04.280
A woman can always change her mind,
it's what we're known for. Ah...

40:08.680 --> 40:12.280
- Hello, Mrs Drewe. Everyone well?
- Very well, thank you, milord,

40:12.360 --> 40:14.710
but I've left the
children with my neighbour.

40:14.760 --> 40:18.560
- Tim thought I should have a day off
to enjoy myself. - Quite right too.

40:20.600 --> 40:22.280
Nice to see you.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.950
What else would you like to do?

40:24.000 --> 40:28.080
If you're asking, could we get this
business sorted for good and all?

40:28.160 --> 40:31.880
I don't mean to sound stubborn,
but surely it is sorted.

40:31.960 --> 40:35.760
It means a lot to Lady Mary and the
family that we're married in the house

40:35.840 --> 40:38.230
- and I can't see why we shouldn't be.
- You can't?

40:38.280 --> 40:39.840
No, I can't.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.800
If we had family nearby, or a
place that meant something special,
it'd be different, but we don't

40:44.880 --> 40:48.640
and Downton Abbey means much
more to me than the school.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.120
I'm sorry, but it does.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.390
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,

40:53.440 --> 40:56.030
- it is time for the announcement
for Best In Show. - Ah!

40:56.080 --> 40:59.440
- First prize goes to Golden
Empress of Downton Abbey. - Oh!

40:59.520 --> 41:02.110
Earned by the Earl of
Grantham and Lady Mary Crawley.

41:02.160 --> 41:04.150
- Very good.
- Pig man -- Mr Timothy Drewe.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.960
Well done, My Lord.

41:06.040 --> 41:07.750
Yes, well done, us.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.790
Where's Miss Marigold, milady?

41:09.840 --> 41:12.800
She was... Who's got Marigold?

41:12.880 --> 41:15.230
- She was here just...
- No, she's gone.

41:15.280 --> 41:18.230
- I gather we've won.
- Yes, but Miss Marigold's missing.

41:18.280 --> 41:22.080
- What? - Oh, my god. - Don't worry,
she's just wandered off. She's fine.

41:22.160 --> 41:24.310
She'll be perfectly fine, you'll see.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.350
- What is it?
- Marigold's gone.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.760
I was talking to your wife and
Marigold was just in front of us.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.030
How could I possibly
have lost sight of her?

41:32.080 --> 41:34.830
Stay with your mother.
Everyone spread out. Carson!

41:34.880 --> 41:36.470
I'm coming with you.

41:36.520 --> 41:38.390
Barrow, come with me.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.030
(TENSE, SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

41:48.480 --> 41:51.270
- What is it, milady?
- We're missing Miss Marigold.

41:51.320 --> 41:53.350
- Don't say that word.
- Don't be silly.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.140
She's missing now and
soon she'll be found.

42:05.360 --> 42:07.630
- Any luck?
- I'm afraid not, milord.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.680
Barrow...

42:11.040 --> 42:14.720
- Have you got a car here, milady?
- What? No, I came with my parents.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.510
- Why?
- I know where we'll find her.

42:16.560 --> 42:19.760
- Where? - I've just realised Margie's
gone too and she's taken the truck.

42:19.840 --> 42:22.750
- You mean she... - I'm afraid so,
milady, but she won't hurt her.

42:22.800 --> 42:26.000
Whatever she does, she won't hurt
her. Calm them down and let's go.

42:27.840 --> 42:30.440
It's all right, we had a message.

42:30.520 --> 42:33.600
Mrs Drewe found her and has taken
her home to be out of harm's way.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.310
- Could you take me there now
to collect her? - Of course.

42:36.360 --> 42:38.360
I'll get the car.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.880
- What's going on?
- Panic over, milady.

42:47.960 --> 42:50.750
Miss Marigold's at Yew
Tree Farm with Mrs Drewe.

42:50.800 --> 42:54.320
- They've just gone to fetch her now.
- At the farm with Mrs Drewe? Why?

42:54.400 --> 42:57.190
She took her there for safety.
It was good of her, really.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.240
And how will we get back?

43:26.800 --> 43:28.390
Please, let me go in alone.

43:28.440 --> 43:30.910
- I'll come.
- No, I don't wanna frighten her.

43:30.960 --> 43:33.300
Let him, he knows what he's doing.

43:42.440 --> 43:44.840
♪ HUMS TWINKLE TWINKLE, LITTLE STAR

44:00.440 --> 44:02.440
She was bored.

44:04.280 --> 44:07.280
They were paying her no
attention, none at all.

44:08.320 --> 44:10.260
So you brought her here.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.190
Where else would I bring her?

44:13.240 --> 44:15.240
This is her home...

44:16.480 --> 44:19.270
.. and no-one was looking
after her, not one of 'em.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.240
Give her to me now.

44:22.280 --> 44:24.270
You're not angry are you, Tim?

44:24.320 --> 44:29.320
Surely, you can't be angry that
I only want to hold her close

44:29.400 --> 44:31.840
and love her as much as I can.

44:39.520 --> 44:41.200
No, my darling.

44:41.280 --> 44:43.560
I'm not angry at all.

44:47.120 --> 44:49.120
But give her to me...

44:50.680 --> 44:52.680
.. please.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.240
There we are, safe and sound.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.640
Hello, darling.

45:28.040 --> 45:31.320
Let's get you back in
the car and off home.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.750
I'll start looking for another
tenancy in the morning.

45:35.800 --> 45:37.390
I am sorry, Drewe.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.430
I want to help as much as I can.

45:39.480 --> 45:42.840
Please, just tell me if there's
anything you need from me.

45:42.920 --> 45:45.550
- That's very kind of you, milord.
- It's not kind.

45:45.600 --> 45:49.200
It's a poor return for what you
and Mrs Drewe have done for us.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.520
- I know how much Lady Edith...
- There you are.

45:52.600 --> 45:56.280
- .. know how much all of us owe to
you and your wife. - Don't feel badly.

45:56.360 --> 46:01.120
We made a plan, Lady Edith and
I, but we forgot about emotion...

46:03.280 --> 46:05.990
.. and emotion's what can
trip you up every time.

46:06.040 --> 46:08.200
God bless you, Drewe.

46:08.280 --> 46:10.270
God bless you and your family.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.280
The same to you, milord.

46:12.360 --> 46:14.360
The very same to you.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.040
He's agreed.

46:28.120 --> 46:30.830
It seems very unfair, but I've
thought and thought about it

46:30.880 --> 46:32.470
and I don't see what else we can do.

46:32.520 --> 46:34.510
I think it's for the best.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.560
I know it's for the best.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.790
- Did you drink at luncheon?
- No, I did not.

46:49.840 --> 46:52.840
One wrong move and snap,
you're out on your ear.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.230
You think I'm a bully.
I think you're a snob.

46:55.280 --> 46:58.070
- I don't suppose you'd like a drink with me?
- All right. Why not?

46:58.120 --> 47:02.000
I'm surprised at you, Mrs Hughes. This is
not the behaviour I would look for from you.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.750
Mr Spratt seems very
preoccupied at the moment.

47:04.800 --> 47:07.750
- This is the tonic Mr Mason needs.
- But it's not definite yet.

47:07.800 --> 47:11.560
- We've come to dress the bride.
- There's a sentence I never thought I'd hear.
