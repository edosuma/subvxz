<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

03:56.320 --> 03:57.924
What are they doing with the bodies?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.684
Get back to work.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.371
No. I've been here for weeks.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.650
I'm not scrubbing one more corpse
until you tell me why I'm doing it.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.768
You will know why.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.049
- When?
- When it's time, not before.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.246
Get back to work.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.209
- When do I get to play the game?
- Game?

04:17.279 --> 04:20.089
The game. The Game of Faces.

04:20.839 --> 04:23.491
You tried already. You failed.

04:23.560 --> 04:24.686
I didn't even know I was playing.

04:24.760 --> 04:26.364
Who are you?

04:27.840 --> 04:28.841
No one.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.601
Get back to work.

04:31.840 --> 04:33.126
Who are you?

04:33.600 --> 04:36.206
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?

04:37.520 --> 04:40.808
I'm from Westeros, just like you.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.440
Daughter of a lord, just like you.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.369
Except I was an only child.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.808
Heir to his fortune.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.451
My mother died.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.281
My father remarried,
and his new wife gave birth to a girl.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.805
My stepmother didn't want any rivals
for her precious daughter,

05:03.120 --> 05:05.202
so she tried to kill me with poison.

05:05.760 --> 05:07.330
I found out.

05:07.400 --> 05:09.607
Sought help from the Faceless Men.

05:12.240 --> 05:14.766
And my father was widowed again.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.642
I've been serving them ever since.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.129
Was that true or a lie?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.161
What?

05:37.240 --> 05:39.208
Did you believe every word I said?

05:44.280 --> 05:45.441
Get back to work.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.368
Who are you?

06:12.160 --> 06:13.605
Who are you?

06:19.040 --> 06:20.121
Arya.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.602
And where did you come from?

06:23.680 --> 06:24.841
Westeros.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.209
My family home is Winterfell.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.927
I'm the youngest daughter of a great lord,
Eddard Stark.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.481
He died in battle.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.246
A lie.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.369
After he was executed, I fled the capital.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.609
Had to kill a stable boy.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.205
Drove my sword through his back.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.287
A lie.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.491
I stabbed him in the gut.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.647
I tried to find my mother and brother,
but I never did.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.041
They were murdered by Walder Frey.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.806
An outlaw kidnapped me,
a man called Polliver.

07:04.680 --> 07:08.082
A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.602
He tried to sell me,
but was wounded in a fight.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.208
He begged me to kill him, but I wouldn't.
I left him in the mountains to die.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.807
I wanted him to suffer. I hated him.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.567
I hated him.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.890
That's not a lie!

07:25.320 --> 07:28.244
A girl lies to me,

07:28.320 --> 07:31.722
to the Many-Faced God, to herself.

07:31.840 --> 07:33.968
Does she truly want to be no one?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.081
Yes.

07:41.040 --> 07:44.044
I'm not playing this stupid game anymore!

07:44.320 --> 07:46.163
We never stop playing.

08:08.520 --> 08:12.127
So, those villages we were supposed to find?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.009
We can't live on berries and roots.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.081
I can.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.206
You're not hungry?

08:19.080 --> 08:20.411
Of course I'm hungry.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.521
You're an awful traveling companion,
do you know that?

08:23.600 --> 08:25.489
Possibly the least charming
man I've ever met.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.130
I'm not your traveling companion.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.522
We are traveling together
in each other's company, therefore...

08:30.600 --> 08:32.010
Do you ever shut up?

08:32.880 --> 08:35.884
I sailed from King's Landing to Pentos
in a crate

08:36.240 --> 08:38.846
without ever saying a word.

08:38.919 --> 08:39.921
Why?

08:43.480 --> 08:46.290
It never occurred to you
to ask why until now?

08:48.600 --> 08:52.969
You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister
decided to visit a brothel in Volantis?

08:53.080 --> 08:56.323
I'm sure you visited many brothels
in many cities.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.921
I killed my father.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.042
He wanted to execute me
for a crime I didn't commit.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.682
And he was fucking the woman I loved.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.723
As miserable as you are, Mormont,
at least your father was a good man.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.290
What do you know about my father?

09:26.360 --> 09:29.011
I met him. I visited the Wall.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.087
When I asked him about his men,

09:33.200 --> 09:35.441
he knew all their stories, every one of them.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.969
He actually cared about the people
under his command.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.251
How do they put it in the Watch?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.971
"We shall never see his like again."

09:55.160 --> 09:58.209
Oh, you didn't know.

10:03.840 --> 10:06.571
I'm sorry. I am.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.407
How?

10:12.520 --> 10:13.931
I only know what I heard.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.281
How?

10:15.360 --> 10:17.601
He was leading
an expedition beyond the Wall.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.530
There was a mutiny.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.450
He was murdered by his own men.

10:35.160 --> 10:36.810
We better keep moving.

11:27.280 --> 11:28.520
Valar Morghulis.

11:28.920 --> 11:30.490
Valar Dohaeris.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.284
I have nowhere else to go.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.926
I've taken her to every healer in Braavos.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.281
I've spent every penny I had.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.125
She suffers every day of her life.

11:50.240 --> 11:52.004
I just want it to end.

12:20.320 --> 12:21.845
It hurts.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.087
I know.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.124
Don't be afraid.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.003
I used to be like you.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.165
I was sick.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.090
I was dying.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.526
But my father never gave up on me.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.524
He loved me

12:49.560 --> 12:53.246
more than anything in the world,
just like your father loves you.

12:54.120 --> 12:55.690
So he brought me here.

12:57.360 --> 13:00.091
My father prayed to the Many-Faced God,

13:02.160 --> 13:04.049
and I drank the water from his fountain.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.484
It healed me.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.367
I've devoted my life to him now.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.048
You don't want to hurt anymore?

13:28.560 --> 13:29.800
Drink.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.050
Is a girl ready?

16:17.720 --> 16:20.564
To give up her ears, her nose, her tongue?

16:22.320 --> 16:25.051
Her hopes and dreams, her loves and hates?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.930
All that makes a girl who she is?

16:29.360 --> 16:30.930
Forever?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.000
No.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.926
A girl is not ready to become no one.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.081
But she is ready to become someone else.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.762
Why Daenerys? Why is she worth all this?

17:06.520 --> 17:07.806
As I recall,

17:07.920 --> 17:11.208
the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens
during Robert's Rebellion.

17:11.680 --> 17:13.728
Do you believe in anything?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.040
I believe in lots of things.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.042
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.248
The gods, destiny.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.651
Do you believe there's a plan for this world?

17:23.960 --> 17:26.041
- No.
- Neither did I.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.566
I was a cynic, just like you.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.085
Then I saw a girl step into a great fire
with three stone eggs.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.803
When the fire burned out,
I thought I'd find her blackened bones.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.846
Instead, I saw her, Daenerys,

17:40.920 --> 17:44.891
alive and unhurt, holding her baby dragons.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.960
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?

17:50.520 --> 17:51.601
No.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.003
It's hard to be a cynic after that.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.288
Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.408
No, it doesn't.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.801
The Targaryens are famously insane.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.611
What if she conquers the world? Then what?

18:05.680 --> 18:08.047
A thousand years of peace and prosperity?

18:08.120 --> 18:10.248
First we have to conquer the world.

18:10.320 --> 18:11.685
We?

18:11.760 --> 18:14.001
All right, let's assume
your dreams come true.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.529
She's ecstatic when
you bring her this enemy dwarf.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.604
She hacks off my head
and restores your position.

18:20.680 --> 18:24.366
You command her army, sail to Westeros,
defeat all your enemies,

18:24.440 --> 18:27.284
and watch her climb those steps
and sit on the Iron Throne.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.761
Hurrah. Long live the queen. Then what?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.247
Then she rules.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.168
So, a woman who has not spent
a single day of her adult life in Westeros

18:35.240 --> 18:37.368
becomes the ruler of Westeros?
That's justice?

18:37.640 --> 18:40.007
- She's the rightful heir.
- Why?

18:40.080 --> 18:43.766
Because her father, who burned
living men for amusement, was the king?

18:47.080 --> 18:49.481
- That's a slave ship.
- Why are they anchored?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.325
They probably came ashore for...

18:51.440 --> 18:52.805
Water.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.249
Got a lot of fight in you, huh?

19:15.480 --> 19:16.845
Salt mines?

19:17.480 --> 19:20.723
Yeah, that or a galley slave.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.809
He looks strong enough.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.769
What about the dwarf?

19:25.400 --> 19:26.447
Worthless.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.041
Cut his throat.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.646
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
Let's discuss this.

19:32.720 --> 19:34.165
And then chop off his cock.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.331
We'll sell it for a fortune.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.442
A dwarf's cock has magic powers.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.846
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, Wait!

19:41.920 --> 19:46.448
You can’t just hand a dry cock to a merchant
and expect him to pay for it.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.369
He has to know it came from a dwarf.

19:48.440 --> 19:51.762
And how could he know
unless he sees the dwarf?

19:51.840 --> 19:53.604
It will be a dwarf-sized cock.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.603
Guess again.

20:00.800 --> 20:03.883
The dwarf lives until we
find a cock merchant.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.602
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.763
We're bound for Volantis, not Slaver's Bay.

20:18.800 --> 20:21.326
Besides, she reopened the fighting pits.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.165
I've never heard of free men
fighting in the pits.

20:24.760 --> 20:26.569
The fighting pits in Meereen?

20:26.680 --> 20:29.081
You're in luck, then.
You're about to be rich.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.969
You are looking at one of the great warriors
in the Seven Kingdoms.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.201
Him.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.041
Him?

20:38.760 --> 20:40.842
He's got to be 60 years old.

20:41.640 --> 20:45.929
Sure, he's a bit long in the tooth,
a bit withered, been in the sun too long.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.891
We can all see that.
But he is a veteran of 100 battles.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.122
They wrote songs about him.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.880
That true?

21:05.920 --> 21:10.209
He won the tournament at Lannisport,
unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.446
The Kingslayer.

21:15.520 --> 21:18.683
Jousting. You're talking about jousting.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.286
A fancy game for fancy lads.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.931
The men who fight in the pits of Meereen
will swallow him whole.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.571
I killed a Dothraki bloodrider
in single combat.

21:37.560 --> 21:38.846
Liar.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.651
It's no lie. His name was Qotho.

21:41.720 --> 21:44.041
He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.606
Take me to Slaver's Bay,
put a sword in my hand,

21:48.680 --> 21:49.886
I'll prove my worth.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.083
For my children. Money.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.767
Lord Baelish.

22:10.840 --> 22:11.887
Yes?

22:14.360 --> 22:16.408
Lancel Lannister.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.529
Brother Lancel.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.011
We abandon our family names.

22:22.240 --> 22:23.844
That's quite a family to abandon.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.090
The city has changed
since you were here last.

22:27.160 --> 22:28.924
We flooded the gutters with wine,

22:29.200 --> 22:31.680
smashed the false idols,

22:31.760 --> 22:33.569
and set the godless on the run.

22:34.400 --> 22:35.447
Well done.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.328
I'm here on urgent business
for the Queen Mother.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.001
Should I send word that I'll be delayed?

22:51.240 --> 22:52.730
Step carefully, Lord Baelish.

22:52.800 --> 22:56.691
You'll find there's little tolerance for
flesh peddlers in the new King's Landing.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.730
We both peddle fantasies, Brother Lancel.

22:59.800 --> 23:02.246
Mine just happen to be entertaining.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.331
Do you think it's wise, Your Grace,

23:15.120 --> 23:16.565
arresting the heir to Highgarden?

23:16.640 --> 23:19.405
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden.

23:19.480 --> 23:22.529
Of course, and the Faith
were armed on your orders.

23:22.640 --> 23:24.290
The king's orders.

23:24.360 --> 23:26.488
Is the king to blame
for Ser Loras' perversion?

23:26.560 --> 23:28.483
House Tyrell won't tolerate this insult.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.808
House Tyrell won't tolerate it?

23:31.600 --> 23:33.728
I'm the insulted party, Lord Baelish.

23:33.800 --> 23:37.327
Ser Loras was promised to me.
Instead, he chose the company of boys.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.687
One's choice of companion is a curious thing.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.001
Most curious.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.602
Lysa Arryn, for instance.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.444
A thoroughly repellant woman.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.330
Forgive me.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.763
I know you're still in mourning.

23:56.520 --> 24:00.570
Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.291
She was neither of those things.
We both know it.

24:03.360 --> 24:05.169
Still, I pity her son.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.209
How fortunate the young Lord of the Vale
has a new father to counsel him.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.521
I know how hard it can be

24:12.600 --> 24:14.967
to lose both your parents
at such a young age.

24:15.040 --> 24:18.010
If war comes to Westeros, will the
Knights of the Vale fight for their king?

24:19.160 --> 24:21.606
Young Lord Robin heeds my advice,

24:22.720 --> 24:25.564
and I have always counseled
loyalty to the throne.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.211
Good.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.525
If there's nothing else.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.690
There is another matter, Your Grace.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.286
Something so urgent
I couldn't trust the words to a raven.

24:39.680 --> 24:42.251
You once charged me with finding Arya Stark.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.363
To my shame, I failed you.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.409
But I have found Sansa Stark.

24:49.360 --> 24:52.842
Alive and well and home again

24:52.920 --> 24:54.001
living at Winterfell.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.289
That's not possible.

24:56.440 --> 24:58.647
My sources are well placed.

25:00.200 --> 25:04.489
They tell me Roose Bolton
plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay,

25:04.560 --> 25:07.040
a bastard recently legitimized
by King Tommen.

25:07.240 --> 25:10.847
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North
by the grace of my father.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.891
Indeed, his reward
for stabbing his own king in the heart.

25:16.160 --> 25:18.481
We were fools to trust a turncloak.

25:18.840 --> 25:22.526
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks
gives him more legitimacy in the North

25:22.600 --> 25:24.762
than an alliance with a hated southern house.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.166
I will skin him and his bastard
like that wretch on their bloody sigil.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.890
I would counsel patience, Your Grace.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.485
Patience?

25:33.960 --> 25:36.691
Sansa helped murder my son.
Roose Bolton is a traitor.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.646
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor,
marching with his army on Winterfell.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.646
Let Stannis and Roose battle.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.563
Let the enemies of the throne
slaughter each other.

25:45.640 --> 25:49.361
And when they're done, seize Winterfell
from whichever thief survives.

25:49.440 --> 25:54.002
Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here.
The weather has already begun to turn.

25:54.080 --> 25:58.529
That is why it is critical to strike soon,
while the victor still licks his wounds.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.407
Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.723
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage
of a kitchen mouse.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.165
Ser Jaime, then.

26:08.240 --> 26:11.084
Jaime's away
on a sensitive diplomatic mission.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.927
I have no idea when he'll be back.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.650
Perhaps I can help.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.882
The Knights of the Vale
are some of the best fighters in Westeros,

26:19.960 --> 26:21.928
trained to battle in the ice and the snow.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.968
Forgive me, Lord Baelish,

26:24.960 --> 26:29.648
you have a reputation as a moneylender
and a brothel keeper, not a military man.

26:29.720 --> 26:34.203
You wouldn't risk a single Lannister soldier
or a single coin from the royal treasury.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.280
What do you have to lose?

26:36.880 --> 26:38.689
A brothel keeper?

26:39.040 --> 26:40.280
And if you succeed?

26:40.360 --> 26:42.408
Name me Warden of the North.

26:47.280 --> 26:49.328
I'll speak to the king this evening,

26:50.560 --> 26:52.562
have him issue a royal decree.

26:52.840 --> 26:55.605
I'll not rest until the
lion flies over Winterfell.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.887
I'll know you're a man of your word

26:57.960 --> 27:00.804
when I see Sansa Stark's head on a spike.

27:00.880 --> 27:01.927
As I said,

27:03.040 --> 27:04.849
I live to serve.

27:11.080 --> 27:13.526
I'm going to ask him tomorrow.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.843
- What if he says no?
- He won't.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.764
We've waited long enough.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.801
I want you to be my wife.

27:21.880 --> 27:23.291
Now.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.767
What is it?

27:26.400 --> 27:29.643
Do you want to marry me
because our families arranged it?

27:29.720 --> 27:31.051
Or do you...

27:39.120 --> 27:41.441
We can't. Not yet.

27:41.520 --> 27:42.567
Why not?

27:42.680 --> 27:44.762
You know why not. Someone will see.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.207
You are going to be my wife.

27:47.280 --> 27:51.080
I am going to be your husband.

27:51.560 --> 27:54.086
We're allowed
to walk through the gardens together.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.683
How many other girls
have you walked through these gardens?

27:59.760 --> 28:02.366
I like the way your eyes go squinty
when you're jealous.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.966
They do not go squinty,
and you didn't answer the question.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.208
They make a lovely couple.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.881
A Lannister and a Martell.

28:11.840 --> 28:14.889
They have no idea how dangerous that is.

28:15.440 --> 28:17.329
We must protect them.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.289
Yes, my prince.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.770
You haven't had to use
that ax of yours in a long time.

28:25.640 --> 28:27.165
I hope you remember how.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.763
I remember how.

28:32.680 --> 28:36.401
The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun

28:36.480 --> 28:40.451
And her kisses were warmer than spring

28:41.480 --> 28:45.690
The Dornishman's blade
It was made of black steel

28:45.760 --> 28:48.809
And its kiss was a terrible thing

28:50.480 --> 28:54.007
The Dornishman's wife
Would sing as she bathed

28:54.600 --> 28:56.887
In a voice that was sweet as a peach...

28:56.960 --> 28:58.564
All right, that's enough.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.404
I'm coming to the best part.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.528
We're trying to blend in.

29:02.600 --> 29:04.409
Don't want everyone in Dorne
to hear your accent.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.209
This song really is all about the ending.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.681
It can wait. There.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.885
That's the Water Gardens.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.531
And once we've got the princess,
then what?

29:19.200 --> 29:20.770
I like to improvise.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.161
That explains the golden hand.

29:43.920 --> 29:47.720
Unbowed. Unbent. Unbroken.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.681
For Oberyn.

29:51.320 --> 29:52.367
For Oberyn.

30:32.280 --> 30:34.681
Well, she's made herself at home.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.491
Myrcella.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.091
Uncle Jaime?

30:46.800 --> 30:47.881
I...

30:49.000 --> 30:50.889
I don't understand. What are you doing here?

30:50.960 --> 30:52.450
Let's speak in private.

30:52.520 --> 30:53.885
I am Trystane Martell.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.211
Trystane is my intended.

30:56.880 --> 30:58.769
Excellent. Good to meet you.

30:59.040 --> 31:00.610
We weren't expecting you, Lord Jaime.

31:00.680 --> 31:03.684
Why don't you let them
have some time alone, son?

31:08.520 --> 31:10.284
Let's not do something stupid.

31:15.640 --> 31:16.721
That was something stupid.

31:16.800 --> 31:18.370
We have to go, Myrcella, now.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.527
You hurt him!

31:19.600 --> 31:21.204
He'll be fine, I promise. But we have to...

31:26.400 --> 31:27.481
Oh, for fuck's sake.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.167
Take her!

32:14.000 --> 32:15.525
- You're coming with me.
- I don't want to.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.523
I wasn't asking, princess.

32:25.760 --> 32:27.171
Drop your weapons!

32:35.360 --> 32:37.727
I am Obara Sand.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.564
Daughter of Oberyn Martell.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.290
I fight for Dorne. Who do you fight for?

32:43.360 --> 32:45.328
Drop your weapons.

33:03.400 --> 33:06.563
When you were whole,
it would have been a good fight.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.323
You fight pretty good for a little girl.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.611
Halt!

33:50.480 --> 33:51.527
Oh.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.887
You can smell the shit from five miles away.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.131
Well, why have we stopped? Go on.

34:00.520 --> 34:03.205
Rumors and gossip, that's all they've got.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.203
It's theater, nothing more.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.648
If they arrested
all the pillow biters in King's Landing,

34:08.719 --> 34:11.530
there'd be no room left in the dungeons
for anyone else.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.329
Everyone knew about him and Renly.

34:13.440 --> 34:16.967
Renly Baratheon shagged
half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.804
Everyone knew, no one cared.

34:18.880 --> 34:20.245
But he was the king's brother.

34:20.320 --> 34:22.208
And Loras is the queen's brother.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.647
No, no, no, no. This is unacceptable.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.047
- Cersei's behind it.
- Yes, of course she is.

34:27.120 --> 34:31.125
She wants to drag our name through the dirt,
put us in our place.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.123
Get some rest, dear. You look appalling.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.328
And let me deal with Cersei Lannister.

34:41.960 --> 34:45.009
Your Grace, I have traveled a long way.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.524
You must be exhausted.

34:50.040 --> 34:53.123
Put the pen down, dear.
We both know you're not writing anything.

34:53.199 --> 34:56.123
Ah, yes. The famously tart-tongued
Queen of Thorns.

34:56.199 --> 34:59.204
And the famous tart, Queen Cersei.

35:03.520 --> 35:04.726
I beg your pardon?

35:04.800 --> 35:08.202
I know you're behind
this absurd incarceration of my grandson.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.762
If you apologize for that comment,
perhaps I'll...

35:10.840 --> 35:13.684
You'll get your apology when I get Loras.

35:15.040 --> 35:19.090
I was as shocked as anyone
when the Faith arrested Ser Loras.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.087
I have no love for these fanatics,

35:22.160 --> 35:24.731
but what can a Queen Mother do?

35:25.880 --> 35:28.087
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing

35:28.160 --> 35:31.323
the troops, gold,
and wheat my house supplies?

35:31.440 --> 35:35.490
I can assure you,
our alliance with House Tyrell remains...

35:35.560 --> 35:39.884
Do you expect the alliance to continue
after you've thrown our future into prison?

35:41.040 --> 35:42.246
As I said,

35:42.560 --> 35:44.642
I didn't imprison anyone.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.324
As for your veiled threats...

35:46.400 --> 35:47.561
What veil?

35:49.880 --> 35:54.488
The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace
to a war-torn country.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.723
Do you really want to see
the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?

36:01.000 --> 36:02.570
I didn't trust your father.

36:03.320 --> 36:05.527
I didn't particularly like him.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.803
But I respected him. He was no fool.

36:09.120 --> 36:12.442
He understood that sometimes
we must work with our rivals

36:12.520 --> 36:14.090
rather than destroy them.

36:14.280 --> 36:16.248
House Lannister has no rival.

36:18.760 --> 36:22.242
The High Septon has called for an inquest,
not a trial.

36:22.320 --> 36:26.848
Just a small hearing to determine
whether the charges against Loras have merit,

36:26.920 --> 36:28.843
which I'm sure they don't.

36:28.920 --> 36:32.208
Loras will be freed,
our happy alliance will continue,

36:33.960 --> 36:37.009
and we'll forget
this unfortunate conversation ever happened.

36:39.080 --> 36:40.320
Good day, Lady Olenna.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.963
You are aware of
the rumors concerning you and Renly?

37:04.080 --> 37:06.560
I don't pay attention to rumors.

37:06.640 --> 37:09.723
You were said
to be despondent when he died.

37:10.440 --> 37:13.364
Witnesses state that you
refused to leave his bedside,

37:13.440 --> 37:16.011
even as Stannis' army closed in.

37:16.480 --> 37:17.720
He was my friend.

37:18.840 --> 37:19.841
He was my king.

37:20.840 --> 37:22.490
Wasn't Joffrey your king?

37:22.840 --> 37:25.571
He was anointed by the Seven, not Renly.

37:25.680 --> 37:30.208
I was wrong to support
Renly's claim, I know that.

37:31.480 --> 37:33.164
But I was forgiven by Joffrey.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.082
I fought for him at the Battle of Blackwater.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.091
Yes, wearing Renly's armor.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.685
Why does it matter what I wore?

37:41.760 --> 37:44.445
Do you deny all the charges against you?

37:44.520 --> 37:45.567
Fornication.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.241
Buggery. Blasphemy.

37:49.320 --> 37:50.731
Of course I deny them.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.768
You never lay with Renly Baratheon?

37:53.360 --> 37:54.566
Never.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.804
Nor any other man?

37:57.520 --> 37:58.521
Never.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.971
That will be all, Ser Loras.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.567
Well, I think that's quite enough of that.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.206
The Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.201
You call me forward?

38:18.280 --> 38:20.647
Yes, we have some questions for you.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.565
- I am the queen.
- You are.

38:25.000 --> 38:27.241
And according to the law of the Seven,

38:27.320 --> 38:32.804
neither kings nor queens are exempt
from testimony at a holy inquest.

38:50.760 --> 38:54.207
How do you respond to
these charges against your brother?

38:54.600 --> 38:56.170
They are lies.

38:56.240 --> 38:57.605
- All of them?
- All of them.

38:58.520 --> 38:59.931
Queen Margaery,

39:01.000 --> 39:04.527
in the presence of the gods,
do you swear that your brother is innocent

39:04.600 --> 39:07.649
of these charges against him,
to the best of your knowledge?

39:08.240 --> 39:09.685
Yes, I swear it.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.962
Thank you, Your Grace.

39:39.360 --> 39:40.930
Do you know this man?

39:41.720 --> 39:42.801
Yes.

39:43.320 --> 39:44.651
Very well.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.765
He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden.

39:48.080 --> 39:49.730
How did you come to meet?

39:50.520 --> 39:52.488
I squired for him.

39:52.800 --> 39:54.450
He took a liking to me.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.807
He summoned me to his chamber
the first day we met.

39:59.080 --> 40:02.084
And what occurred in his chamber?

40:02.160 --> 40:06.643
We engaged in intimate relations.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.005
You lay with him?

40:09.080 --> 40:10.366
That night and many others.

40:10.440 --> 40:12.841
Liar. He's a liar.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.248
Is there anyone else
who can support your claim?

40:17.160 --> 40:18.650
Yes.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.331
Yes, Queen Margaery.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.969
She walked in on us once, not long ago.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.044
She didn't seem surprised.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.890
This testimony is an insult to a great house.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.005
Why should the Faith or anyone else

40:33.080 --> 40:36.289
take the word of a squire
over the heir to Highgarden?

40:36.360 --> 40:38.488
He has a birthmark, Your Grace.

40:38.920 --> 40:41.002
Quite high on his thigh.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.524
Wine-colored
and roughly the shape of Dorne.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.485
No! Liar!

40:49.560 --> 40:52.723
What are you doing? Let us pass.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.406
The Faith is satisfied
there is enough evidence

40:55.480 --> 40:57.244
to bring a formal trial

40:57.800 --> 40:59.450
for Ser Loras

41:00.040 --> 41:01.371
and Queen Margaery.

41:01.440 --> 41:02.771
What?

41:03.040 --> 41:07.409
Bearing false witness before the gods
is as grave a sin as any, my lady.

41:07.840 --> 41:08.887
Take her.

41:09.240 --> 41:10.685
No.

41:11.040 --> 41:12.121
Tommen.

41:12.320 --> 41:13.367
Tommen!

41:14.920 --> 41:17.127
You can't do this. I am the queen.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.801
Tommen! Tommen!

41:20.880 --> 41:23.884
I am your queen. How dare you?
Take your hands off me!

41:24.720 --> 41:26.449
Tommen!

41:50.040 --> 41:51.087
What do you want?

41:51.880 --> 41:54.929
Lord Ramsay sent me
to draw your bath, my lady.

41:56.040 --> 41:59.931
You want to be clean and fresh
for your new husband, don't you?

42:16.640 --> 42:18.324
You're so beautiful,

42:19.200 --> 42:20.804
but you need to keep him happy.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.601
Ramsay gets bored easily.

42:26.720 --> 42:28.245
You don't want to end up like...

42:30.440 --> 42:32.966
Well, like the others.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.490
What others?

42:35.720 --> 42:36.960
I shouldn't gossip.

42:37.920 --> 42:39.490
Oh, it's good to see the red again.

42:40.720 --> 42:42.245
No point hiding anymore.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.810
What others?

42:43.880 --> 42:48.681
Let's see, there was Kyra,
the blacksmith's daughter.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.286
She was tall like you, lovely figure.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.809
But she talked and talked and talked,

42:57.120 --> 42:59.088
and Ramsay grew tired of that.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.409
Then there was Violet.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.131
She had gorgeous blonde hair.

43:04.200 --> 43:07.090
But she got pregnant.

43:07.200 --> 43:10.010
And, well, that was boring.

43:11.160 --> 43:13.766
Then Tansy.

43:13.840 --> 43:15.649
Such a sweet girl.

43:15.720 --> 43:20.681
Of course, sweet girls get a bit dull

43:20.760 --> 43:22.728
after a while, don't they?

43:23.000 --> 43:25.207
Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt.

43:25.360 --> 43:26.486
Hunt?

43:26.720 --> 43:27.721
Mmm.

43:30.040 --> 43:33.886
Have you ever seen a body
after the dogs have been at it?

43:34.840 --> 43:36.604
Not so pretty.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.207
But, well, it's your wedding day.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.321
Why am I talking about such things?

43:46.720 --> 43:48.290
What was your name again?

43:48.360 --> 43:49.885
Myranda.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.884
And how long have you loved him, Myranda?

43:58.600 --> 44:01.365
Did you imagine that he would
be with you forever, is that it?

44:01.440 --> 44:03.329
And I came along and ruined it.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.325
I'm Sansa Stark of Winterfell.

44:10.320 --> 44:14.291
This is my home, and you can't frighten me.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.927
Are you done with your bath, my lady?

44:24.000 --> 44:25.411
Go. I can finish on my own.

44:52.120 --> 44:53.406
Yes?

45:02.440 --> 45:05.091
I've come to escort you
to the godswood, my lady.

45:09.840 --> 45:12.730
If you please, my lady, will you take my arm?

45:12.800 --> 45:13.881
No.

45:16.080 --> 45:18.811
Lord Ramsay, he said I'm to take your arm.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.166
I'm not touching you.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.811
Please.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.211
He'll punish me.

45:28.200 --> 45:30.806
You think I care what he does to you?

46:48.400 --> 46:50.801
Who comes before the Old Gods this night?

46:52.240 --> 46:55.084
Sansa of the House Stark

46:56.600 --> 46:58.250
comes here to be wed.

47:00.320 --> 47:04.245
A woman grown, trueborn and noble.

47:05.240 --> 47:07.891
She comes to beg the blessings of the gods.

47:10.840 --> 47:12.251
Who comes to claim her?

47:21.480 --> 47:23.164
Ramsay of House Bolton.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.848
Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.290
Who gives her?

47:34.520 --> 47:39.242
Theon of House Greyjoy, who was...

47:43.800 --> 47:45.404
Who was her father's ward.

47:47.840 --> 47:51.128
Lady Sansa, will you take this man?

48:21.320 --> 48:23.084
I take this man.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.529
Are you pleased, my lady?

48:59.680 --> 49:02.604
Good. I want you to be happy.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.201
My father said you're still a virgin.

49:21.320 --> 49:22.481
Uh, yes.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.891
Why?

49:27.680 --> 49:29.648
Why are you still a virgin?

49:31.320 --> 49:32.560
Afraid of dwarves?

49:34.480 --> 49:36.369
Lord Tyrion was kind.

49:36.440 --> 49:39.762
He was gentle. He never touched me.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.051
You're not lying to me?

49:43.800 --> 49:45.006
No, my lord.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.401
Lying to your husband on his wedding night,

49:48.320 --> 49:51.130
that would be a bad way to start a marriage.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.123
We're man and wife now.

49:59.240 --> 50:01.686
We should be honest with each other.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.966
Don't you think?

50:04.400 --> 50:05.765
Yes.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.600
Good.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.765
Take off your clothes.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.690
Oh, no, no, no.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.524
You stay here, Reek.

50:31.440 --> 50:32.965
You watch.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.808
Do I need to ask a second time?

50:48.320 --> 50:50.129
I hate asking a second time.

51:18.640 --> 51:19.687
Reek.

51:20.920 --> 51:22.843
I told you to watch.

51:28.880 --> 51:31.565
You've known Sansa since she was a girl.

51:33.120 --> 51:34.849
Now watch her become a woman.

52:15.500 --> 52:23.500
