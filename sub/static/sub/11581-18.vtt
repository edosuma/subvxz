NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.204 --> 00:05.639
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.673 --> 00:08.176
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.209 --> 00:10.178
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.211 --> 00:11.512
are members of an elite squad

00:11.545 --> 00:13.347
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.050
These are their stories.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.588
You know what sucks?

00:20.621 --> 00:23.791
Cramming two people in a room
with only one phone line.

00:23.824 --> 00:25.126
I hate dorms.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.127
Use your cell phone.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.395
I keep going over

00:27.428 --> 00:29.463
my limit,
because you're always online.

00:29.497 --> 00:32.300
You mind logging off
for, like, two seconds?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.302
This is kind of life or death.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.603
You're in a freaking chat room.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.338
Read this.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.075
"Rage is eating
me alive.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.243
"Must release it.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.411
"I have a knife and rope.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.413
"And a five-year-old.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.481
Screw her innocence,
then slice her up."

00:47.515 --> 00:48.482
This is sick.

00:48.516 --> 00:49.783
He swears he's not joking.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.352
"Hey, Dickweed,

00:51.385 --> 00:52.486
I'm calling the Denver cops."

00:52.520 --> 00:53.754
We were trying
to calm him down.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.623
He's replying.
"Thanks for the heads up.

00:55.656 --> 00:56.624
"I love killing pigs.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.092
"I'll mow them down...

00:58.126 --> 00:59.427
come through my door."

00:59.460 --> 01:01.295
Hey!

01:01.329 --> 01:03.131
MAN:
His screen name
is Psycho Killer?

01:03.164 --> 01:05.133
Yeah, in a chat room
for slasher film fans.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.268
I tracked down
the Internet service provider.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.536
I'm on hold with them now.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.803
Guy's obsessed
with mutilation.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.672
And killing cops.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.307
He logged off half an hour ago.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.475
Check out his last post.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.278
"Got to get ready
for my big date.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.446
See you in hell."

01:18.479 --> 01:19.413
Uh-huh.

01:19.447 --> 01:20.614
Hold on. Who?

01:20.648 --> 01:23.384
Jeremy Ostilow?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.519
I'm afraid he's a little
out of our jurisdiction.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.755
We're in Denver, Colorado.

01:27.788 --> 01:28.822
Where is he?

01:28.856 --> 01:29.857
Where else?

01:29.890 --> 01:32.360
New York City.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.534
Maintain fire discipline.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.736
He's got a kid in there.

01:42.770 --> 01:45.239
Hit it.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.707
Police!

01:46.740 --> 01:48.142
Don't move.

01:48.176 --> 01:49.543
Hands where we can see them.

01:49.577 --> 01:50.744
Jeremy Ostilow?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.880
Yes.
GIRL ( shrieks ):
Mommy!

01:52.913 --> 01:54.448
It's okay,
sweetheart.
Are you okay?

01:54.482 --> 01:55.783
What the hell are you doing?

01:55.816 --> 01:57.318
Looking for a Psycho Killer.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.419
A Psycho Killer?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.154
Yeah, your slasher site
screen name?

02:00.188 --> 02:02.290
We linked it to your
main account-- J-J-O-rules.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.357
That's not
my husband's.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.358
It's JJ's.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.359
And who's JJ?

02:05.393 --> 02:07.528
Our son,
Jeremy, Junior.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.163
Found him under the bed.

02:09.197 --> 02:11.199
It was just a joke.

02:16.904 --> 02:21.375
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:21.409 --> 02:24.144
and NBC

03:04.352 --> 03:06.320
He's 12 years old,
for Pete's sake.

03:06.354 --> 03:07.788
Didn't you pull pranks
at that age?

03:07.821 --> 03:09.323
Pranks, yeah,
but I never threatened

03:09.357 --> 03:11.625
to kill any cops,
or say I wanted to...

03:11.659 --> 03:13.727
"Rip off her clothes,

03:13.761 --> 03:15.329
slashing as
I defile her."

03:15.363 --> 03:16.730
That's what
you'd like to do?

03:16.764 --> 03:19.500
Trust me, no more horror movies
or Websites.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.401
Don't blame them.

03:20.434 --> 03:21.635
They didn't make me do this.

03:21.669 --> 03:22.636
Okay, who did?

03:22.670 --> 03:23.637
Please.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.373
He was just trying to impress

03:25.406 --> 03:26.440
other kids on the Internet.

03:26.474 --> 03:29.377
Your son had hardcore
slasher fans freaking out.

03:29.410 --> 03:30.644
They asked him
repeatedly,

03:30.678 --> 03:32.580
"Are you joking?"

03:32.613 --> 03:33.881
They thought you were serious,

03:33.914 --> 03:35.516
and I got to tell you, JJ,
I still do.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.850
Then you're an idiot.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.252
Give it up, Detective.

03:38.286 --> 03:39.253
My parents would die

03:39.287 --> 03:42.523
before they'd let anything bad
happen to me.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.725
MRS. OSTILOW:
Please don't do this to my son.

03:44.758 --> 03:45.893
He's very sensitive.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.395
Have you read
the print-out

03:47.428 --> 03:48.929
that we gave you
from the Internet?

03:48.962 --> 03:51.599
It's just nonsense he picked up
from comic books and movies.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.000
He has no idea what it means.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.802
He went into
graphic detail.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.970
Look, who's going
to fix the door?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.439
You can fill out a form

03:58.472 --> 03:59.507
to be reimbursed by the city.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.708
How long will
that take?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.543
If you're lucky,
I'd say six to eight weeks.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.644
No. It has to be tonight.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.945
What will I tell
the neighbors?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.647
Mrs. Ostilow,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.417
how long has your son been
obsessed with violence?

04:09.450 --> 04:10.984
He's not.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.553
Has he ever hurt his sister?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.054
Never.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.556
I need to talk to her.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.690
Lisette's in her room.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.426
I'll get her.

04:18.459 --> 04:21.729
Underage suspects are entitled
to have a parent present.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.498
Underage victims are not
afforded that same right.

04:24.532 --> 04:25.533
Lisette's not a victim.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.635
I need to talk to her alone.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.438
Fine.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.641
She'll tell you,
she adores her big brother.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.677
"Screw her innocence
and then slice her up."

04:36.710 --> 04:38.879
This is about your sister,
Lisette?

04:38.912 --> 04:40.448
No.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.383
You telling me
there's another five-year-old

04:42.416 --> 04:43.784
out there
who pisses you off that much?

04:45.353 --> 04:47.421
Believe me, I know what a pain
little sisters can be.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.391
Just tell me what she did.

04:50.424 --> 04:53.427
She melted my favorite CD
in her EasyBake oven.

04:53.461 --> 04:54.895
Well, that sucks.
What did you do?

04:54.928 --> 04:56.096
Nothing.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.631
I never do anything.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.567
When someone
makes me mad,

04:59.600 --> 05:00.668
I just imagine hurting them.

05:00.701 --> 05:01.669
It makes me feel better.

05:01.702 --> 05:02.870
So, it's like a release valve.

05:02.903 --> 05:03.871
You think about it,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.439
but don't actually do it.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.441
That's what I said, moron.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.045
You have these thoughts a lot?

05:12.079 --> 05:14.482
All the time.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.749
What are you so angry about?

05:15.783 --> 05:16.950
Stuff.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.519
What kind of stuff?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.354
Life is really stressful,
you know?

05:20.388 --> 05:21.522
Well, I know mine is.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.724
I deal with dirt bags every day.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.926
Like yesterday,
there was this case.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.562
These four guys gang-rape

05:28.596 --> 05:29.763
this sweet Haitian woman.

05:29.797 --> 05:30.864
Detective.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.065
You want to hear the details?

05:32.099 --> 05:33.100
I really don't think

05:33.133 --> 05:34.201
this is appropriate talk.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.504
About how they beat her up,
and they degraded her,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.572
and when she begged for mercy,
they defecated on her?

05:38.606 --> 05:40.040
That's a child
you're talking to.

05:40.073 --> 05:41.375
Read what he wrote.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.511
He wants to act
like an adult predator,

05:43.544 --> 05:44.778
I'll talk to him like one.

05:44.812 --> 05:46.614
You really want to grow up

05:46.647 --> 05:48.816
to be like one
of those perverts, huh?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.384
Why wait?

05:50.418 --> 05:52.386
BENSON:
So, Lisette,

05:52.420 --> 05:55.055
has JJ ever hurt you?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.057
He pulled my hair once.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.492
He did?

05:58.526 --> 06:00.394
That's not nice.

06:00.428 --> 06:01.595
Has he hurt you
any other times?

06:01.629 --> 06:02.996
I have a new game.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.598
Want to play?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.766
You know what?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.935
Uh, maybe later,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.604
but we need to finish talking
about JJ first, okay?

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
Okay.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.841
Okay. So...

06:13.874 --> 06:16.510
Lisette, I need you to show me
on this doll

06:16.544 --> 06:19.547
all the places
where JJ hurt you.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.650
Right.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.618
And has he hurt you
anyplace else?

06:24.652 --> 06:26.620
Not me.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.622
Has he hurt someone else?

06:28.656 --> 06:29.957
Who?

06:29.990 --> 06:32.793
Beverly and Erica.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.795
And do you know
where he hurt them?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.702
Okay.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.672
Now, Lisette, I need to talk
to Beverly and Erica.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.774
Does your mommy
know where they are?

06:46.807 --> 06:48.008
No.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.444
They're in the hospital.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.046
What hospital?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.617
Lisette, sweetie,

06:56.650 --> 06:58.852
we need to finish talking
before we can play.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.054
But you said
you wanted to see it.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.757
This is the hospital.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.743
CRAGEN:
Mr. Ostilow,

07:22.776 --> 07:23.911
your son needs help.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.078
He's a boy.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.614
Boys break their
sisters' dolls.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.716
He mutilated 23 of them.

07:28.749 --> 07:29.783
All in the genital area.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.218
He's emotionally disturbed.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.920
You're a psychiatrist,
are you?

07:32.953 --> 07:34.722
No. No, sir, I am not.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.790
That's why I would like you
to sign this.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.025
What is it?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.627
It's a parental
consent form

07:39.660 --> 07:41.595
to commit JJ
for psychiatric
observation.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.996
I won't have him branded crazy.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.565
You'd prefer a criminal record?

07:44.598 --> 07:45.499
For what?

07:45.533 --> 07:47.200
Posting terroristic threats
is a felony.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.770
I am so sick
of people co-opting nine-eleven

07:49.803 --> 07:51.071
for their own agendas.

07:51.104 --> 07:53.874
Where do you want to send him,
Guantanamo Bay?

07:53.907 --> 07:56.644
I'd prefer Bellevue's
Adolescent Ward.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.511
Absolutely not.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.714
Well, he's not going
home to his sister.

08:00.748 --> 08:03.651
So, it's either Bellevue
or juvenile detention.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.885
Your call, sir.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.755
MUNCH:
I hear they shipped

08:07.788 --> 08:09.056
JJ off to the loony bin.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.091
Cragen talked the father
into a 72-hour hold.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.760
Learn anything
from the neighbors?

08:12.793 --> 08:15.128
Yeah, that he should be locked
in a rubber room permanently.

08:15.162 --> 08:15.963
Why, what's he done?

08:15.996 --> 08:17.731
Traumatizes every
tot in the building.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.733
Screams at them
till he's red in the face.

08:19.767 --> 08:20.500
About what?
Any little thing.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.135
Like looking at him
the wrong way.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.638
Yeah, he locked a few
of them up in a utility closet,

08:24.672 --> 08:26.574
convinced them
they were going to be murdered.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.576
They cried for an hour
before he let them out.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.943
Dad smoothed it out
with the parents.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.579
Sent them all
expensive presents.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.913
He's making it worse
by excusing it.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.281
This kid is a
ticking time bomb.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.749
Well, let's just
call the school,

08:35.783 --> 08:37.885
and see if he's
exploded already.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.757
WOMAN:
Trouble paying attention
in class,

08:43.791 --> 08:46.560
poor grades,
inappropriate behavior.

08:46.594 --> 08:47.561
Such as?

08:47.595 --> 08:50.831
He drew a pornographic
image on a girl's desk

08:50.864 --> 08:51.999
with a magic marker.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.300
Tortured artist.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.768
Another time he wrote

08:54.802 --> 08:56.770
an obscenely graphic scenario,

08:56.804 --> 08:58.772
passed it on to another student.

08:58.806 --> 08:59.873
It upset her very much.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.274
FIN:
Still have it?

09:01.308 --> 09:04.778
I contacted his parents,
suggested he needed therapy.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.213
They disagreed.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.281
What's the school doing
about it?

09:08.315 --> 09:09.917
We're not inviting him back
next year.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.084
We'd ask him to leave now,

09:11.118 --> 09:12.252
if it wasn't so close

09:12.285 --> 09:13.721
to the end of the term.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.656
Did he ever hurt
another student?

09:15.689 --> 09:17.725
Well, we suspected
he did once, but

09:17.758 --> 09:18.759
the victim denied it.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.728
What was the incident?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.162
A locker room fight.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.097
Mitchell was a bloody mess.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.199
JJ didn't have a mark on him.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.735
It was perplexing.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.703
Why is that?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.839
If I had to name
the school bully,

09:31.872 --> 09:33.607
it would be Mitchell.

09:33.641 --> 09:34.908
MUNCH:
Dodge Ball?

09:34.942 --> 09:37.611
They haven't outlawed
this barbaric practice yet?

09:37.645 --> 09:38.779
I loved this game.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.047
Yeah, well, you were a sadist.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.949
You know, I literally
weighed 98 pounds.

09:41.982 --> 09:42.983
I can still hear them.

09:43.016 --> 09:43.984
"Break the Pencil."

09:44.017 --> 09:46.086
I was a walking bruise.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.958
I think we found Mitchell.

09:52.793 --> 09:53.727
You're out.
What the...?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.062
Get over here.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.999
JJ came out of the showers.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.001
Someone might have
pulled his towel away.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.202
Why?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.370
Something to do.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.038
So, what happened?

10:05.072 --> 10:07.207
He might have gotten snapped
by a wet towel or two.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.375
All in good fun, you know?

10:08.408 --> 10:09.877
MUNCH:
Yeah.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.144
Getting pelted
by Neanderthals,

10:11.178 --> 10:12.846
in the privates
sounds like a blast.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.847
JJ went postal.

10:13.881 --> 10:15.816
He started wailing on me.

10:15.849 --> 10:18.285
Bloodied my nose,
gave me a black eye,

10:18.318 --> 10:19.753
busted lip...

10:19.787 --> 10:22.055
So, how is it a guy
like you doesn't fight back?

10:22.089 --> 10:23.691
I was freaked out.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.258
Why, because somebody
half your size

10:25.292 --> 10:26.694
finally stood
up to you?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.762
No. Because the whole time
he's hitting me,

10:28.796 --> 10:30.898
he's screaming rape.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.935
Explosive rage,
sexual acting out...

10:34.968 --> 10:36.069
The slipping grades.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.805
Behavioral
and personality changes.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.773
JJ's got all the classic signs
of being molested.

10:39.807 --> 10:40.941
Question is, by whom?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.242
Well, we canvassed the school.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.111
He's not in any
extra-curricular activities,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.345
so I doubt it was a teacher.

10:45.378 --> 10:46.880
No older friends
anyone knows about.

10:46.914 --> 10:47.981
MUNCH:
No friends at all.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.082
Leaves the parents.

10:49.116 --> 10:50.183
Dad was running interference

10:50.217 --> 10:51.218
all through the interview.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.285
Well, it's going to be hard

10:52.319 --> 10:53.386
for JJ to tell about abuse

10:53.420 --> 10:54.855
if his abuser is
sitting right there.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.790
I think the mother
knows about it.

10:56.824 --> 10:59.326
I got the feeling that she
was covering something up.

10:59.359 --> 11:00.894
And aside from
her worrying

11:00.928 --> 11:02.395
about what the
neighbors thought,

11:02.429 --> 11:04.164
this woman has major
guilt issues.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.833
We got to get JJ to open up.

11:05.866 --> 11:06.900
We might have trouble

11:06.934 --> 11:07.835
gaining his trust. I put him

11:07.868 --> 11:09.837
through the wringer
a little bit there.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.905
Huang's got privileges
at Bellevue.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.841
We'll have him
pay a visit.

11:17.845 --> 11:20.147
HUANG:
How are you feeling today, JJ?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.448
I'm locked up
in an insane asylum.

11:21.481 --> 11:24.151
How do you think I feel?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.286
Uh, angry,
frustrated, betrayed.

11:26.319 --> 11:27.855
You're the doctor.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.189
Well, it seems to me

11:29.222 --> 11:30.390
like you're angry.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.225
Are you angry at someone?

11:32.259 --> 11:34.094
My parents.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.462
They're so lame.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.097
What did they do?

11:37.130 --> 11:39.199
They let me wind up here.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.802
Well, maybe they thought
it was for your own good.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.937
They don't care about me.

11:43.971 --> 11:46.439
Sounds like
they let you down before.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.310
I can't say.

11:50.343 --> 11:52.179
You know, JJ, it's okay.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.446
You can tell me.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.748
You don't understand!

11:54.782 --> 11:56.116
I'm not allowed
to talk about it!

11:56.149 --> 11:57.150
Why not?

12:01.254 --> 12:03.156
Because of the contract.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.093
You made a deal not to tell?

12:08.095 --> 12:10.063
I didn't.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.133
My parents did.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.135
JJ,

12:15.168 --> 12:16.503
there isn't a contract

12:16.536 --> 12:19.106
that can legally
cover up a crime.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.441
They are not protecting you.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.211
Why are you protecting them?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.246
Tell me where it happened.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.420
At a sleepover.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.088
Mm-hmm.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.457
There were a bunch
of kids there,

12:37.490 --> 12:41.161
but I was the only one allowed
to sleep in the Treasure Room.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.763
What's the Treasure Room?

12:45.866 --> 12:48.969
His bedroom.

12:49.002 --> 12:52.105
Whose bedroom?

12:52.139 --> 12:54.241
Billy.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.575
And

12:55.608 --> 12:58.145
what did Billy do
in the Treasure Room?

13:00.280 --> 13:03.283
He had these pajamas
laid out for me.

13:04.184 --> 13:06.954
He helped me undress.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.192
I can't...

13:17.197 --> 13:18.798
( crying )

13:21.034 --> 13:23.003
JJ...

13:23.036 --> 13:26.273
( crying )

13:26.306 --> 13:27.841
I'm real sorry

13:27.875 --> 13:30.177
that your parents made you
keep this secret so long...

13:33.280 --> 13:35.415
but you got to get it out now.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.990
He touched me.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.025
He made me touch him.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.162
And did you tell your parents
what happened?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.197
Yeah.

13:50.230 --> 13:52.199
What did they do about it?

13:52.232 --> 13:54.601
Got rich.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.904
What do you mean?

13:56.937 --> 13:59.907
Billy owns the company
my Dad used to work for.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.943
He paid them so much money
not to tell,

14:02.976 --> 14:05.245
they never have to work again.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.254
Until three years ago,

14:14.287 --> 14:16.423
Jeremy Ostilow, Senior,
worked for Tripley Toys.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.391
Company did $1.7 billion
in sales last year.

14:18.425 --> 14:19.559
Oh.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.361
It's owned
by William J. Tripley.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.563
CRAGEN:
Whom, I see by
his press release,

14:23.596 --> 14:24.664
prefers to be called Billy.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.133
BENSON:
35, never married,

14:26.166 --> 14:27.300
clean slate.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.036
Inherited the company
from Daddy.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.904
He doesn't, uh,
actually run the empire,

14:30.938 --> 14:33.006
but he does receive a bulk
of the profits.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.507
We pulled the
Ostilows' financials.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.177
Jeremy received a $2 million
when he left the company.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.979
A lot of corporate executives

14:39.012 --> 14:40.547
have golden parachute
provisions.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.349
This guy was
middle management.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.651
Still he received
an additional million

14:44.684 --> 14:45.986
a year after he left,

14:46.019 --> 14:48.221
and another million
earlier this year.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.924
Boss molested their son,
then bought their silence.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.625
MUNCH:
Tripley's always
had deep pockets

14:52.659 --> 14:53.726
when it comes to kids.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.329
He's given tens of millions
of dollars to charities,

14:56.363 --> 14:57.530
usually child-related.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.599
Programs for gifted kids,

14:59.632 --> 15:01.935
sick kids,

15:01.969 --> 15:03.303
underprivileged kids.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.404
The man sure loves children.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.472
BENSON:
Yeah, too much.

15:05.505 --> 15:06.439
You got to figure that

15:06.473 --> 15:08.108
there's other victims
out there somewhere.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.476
How are we supposed
to weed them out?

15:09.509 --> 15:10.543
We got JJ's statement.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.979
I say we pick up Tripley now.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.380
Have Novak get a search warrant

15:13.413 --> 15:15.682
before he has time
to clean house.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.421
STABLER:
Lederhosen?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.557
Guilty.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.559
Functioning soda fountain,

15:26.593 --> 15:27.694
stuffed animals, arcade games.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.530
All this for a guy who doesn't
have any kids of his own.

15:30.563 --> 15:31.698
FIN:
He owns a toy store.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.634
Maybe he likes
to bring his work home.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.404
This has got to cost more
than my family car.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.605
( chittering )

15:38.638 --> 15:40.140
Whoa. What the
hell is that?

15:40.173 --> 15:41.541
That's Mr. Tripley's lemur.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.576
You've frightened it.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.345
Lemur? Aren't those things
endangered?

15:45.378 --> 15:47.347
It is here. God knows
what he's doing to it.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.449
Don't you dare insult
Mr. Tripley. He's a saint.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.085
Really? Well, have you ever
seen anything, uh,

15:52.119 --> 15:54.621
inappropriate, you know,
questionable?

15:54.654 --> 15:56.056
Never.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.290
There are ten servants on staff.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.491
Ask any of them.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.659
Oh, we intend to.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.361
We understand that you have a,

16:01.394 --> 16:02.996
uh, secret Treasure Room.

16:03.030 --> 16:03.763
You know about that?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.132
It's no secret.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.300
It's every child's
favorite place.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.073
Pervert ahoy.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.244
Pedophilic pirate motif.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.046
Interesting choice.

16:19.079 --> 16:19.946
What do you got to do

16:19.979 --> 16:21.681
to get booty
from this treasure chest?

16:21.714 --> 16:24.084
I wonder how many victims walked
Tripley's gangplank.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.385
It's just like JJ said.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.720
This is where he was molested
three years ago.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.490
This bed's a tight squeeze
for two to sleep in.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.625
Platonically.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.628
Oh, this is just wrong.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.097
Little jammies.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.731
Each one a different theme.

16:38.765 --> 16:40.233
What's this about?

16:40.267 --> 16:42.302
Tripley's idea of lingerie.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.536
Bag 'em up.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.105
Give 'em to the crime lab.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.407
Hopefully, they'll find
some dirty laundry

16:47.440 --> 16:48.608
in the dirty laundry.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.110
It's inconceivable that no one

16:50.143 --> 16:51.611
has turned this guy in by now.

16:51.644 --> 16:52.679
WOMAN:
Mr. Tripley...

16:52.712 --> 16:53.813
( people shouting )

16:53.846 --> 16:55.148
Don't worry, Billy.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.249
I'll have you out
in 15 minutes.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.350
Did you do
it, Billy?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.818
How many kids have
you molested?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.720
Detectives, is the victim male
or female?

17:00.753 --> 17:02.122
No comment. Let us through.

17:02.155 --> 17:02.922
There is no truth
whatsoever

17:02.955 --> 17:04.391
to these outrageous
allegations.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.293
Can you clarify
exactly what the
allegations are?

17:06.326 --> 17:07.627
Scurrilous lies,
plain and simple.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.062
Someone trying to
cash in, no doubt.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.563
Please, people,
clear a path, please.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.399
Billy has dedicated
his life to helping kids.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.534
I can't fathom
why anyone would
smear his good name,

17:14.567 --> 17:17.170
but I promise you, anyone doing
so will be sued for slander.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.738
You're not trying
to threaten a witness

17:18.771 --> 17:19.839
through the press, are you?

17:19.872 --> 17:20.707
No. Are you trying to trample

17:20.740 --> 17:22.675
my First Amendment right
to free speech?

17:22.709 --> 17:23.676
Watch your head.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.278
Excuse me, one more question.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.647
Tell them I would
never hurt a child.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.749
Hey, we're standing right
here, tell us yourself.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.618
What's it going to take
to make this go away?

17:31.651 --> 17:32.685
Oh, you mean a dollar amount?

17:32.719 --> 17:34.454
I'm afraid
that Billy can-/////!t buy his
way

17:34.487 --> 17:35.788
out of this one, not this time.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.124
I didn't do anything.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.158
I love children.

17:38.191 --> 17:39.192
STABLER:
So we hear,

17:39.226 --> 17:40.260
from the boy
you molested.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.361
That's a big lie.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.163
No, it was a
$4 million secret.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.764
That's how much
you paid the family

17:44.797 --> 17:46.166
to keep them quiet.

17:46.199 --> 17:47.700
How many payments
you got left?

17:47.734 --> 17:50.137
TRIPLEY:
The Ostilow settlement has
nothing to do

17:50.170 --> 17:51.371
with molestation.
It was business.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.505
BENSON:
Really? Do you mind

17:52.539 --> 17:54.107
if we take a look
at the contract?

17:54.141 --> 17:55.842
Sorry. We have a
non-disclosure agreement

17:55.875 --> 17:58.111
involving a toy patent we
purchased from Mr. Ostilow.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.679
That's a bunch
of crap.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.613
It's hush money.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.515
You molested their son
and paid them off.

18:02.549 --> 18:04.451
Filthy lies.
BENSON:
Do you deny

18:04.484 --> 18:06.853
having a nine-year-old boy
spend the night at your house?

18:06.886 --> 18:08.621
Kids spend the night
all the time.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.523
Billy has numerous
functions there.

18:10.557 --> 18:11.424
You've seen the place.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.160
Of course the kids
don't want to leave.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.261
The parents are there, too.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.163
And if they're not,
I always get their permission

18:16.196 --> 18:17.230
over the telephone.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.231
How often do you sleep

18:18.265 --> 18:19.098
in the same bed with these kids?

18:19.132 --> 18:20.900
All the time.
What's wrong with that?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.236
You're a 35-year-old man.

18:25.238 --> 18:29.442
I would kill myself before
I did anything to hurt a child.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.444
Pedophiles never think
they're hurting them.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.912
You're just loving them, right?

18:32.945 --> 18:36.149
Yes. But not in the sick way
you're thinking.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.517
I don't think that way.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.387
There's nothing more natural
and more beautiful

18:40.420 --> 18:42.155
than loving a child.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.223
You're sick.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.557
I think we're done here.

18:44.591 --> 18:45.825
BENSON:
No you're not.

18:45.858 --> 18:46.893
Billy still needs to be booked.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.229
And you've got a long,
nasty trial ahead of you.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.830
Unless you really do
care about kids.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.365
In which case
you'll save the victim

18:52.399 --> 18:53.900
an awful lot of pain
and plead out.

18:55.435 --> 18:59.172
MAN:
Motion for Dismissal?

18:59.206 --> 19:00.573
The D.A. has no
physical evidence,

19:00.607 --> 19:01.774
no third-party witness...

19:01.808 --> 19:03.476
We have the victim's
sworn statement

19:03.510 --> 19:05.245
of inappropriate sexual contact.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.547
Delusional fantasies
of an emotionally disturbed boy

19:07.580 --> 19:09.916
obtained while he was sedated
in the lockdown unit

19:09.949 --> 19:11.184
of a psychiatric facility.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.221
Where he was sent for treatment
stemming from the sexual abuse

19:14.254 --> 19:15.121
inflicted by Billy Tripley.

19:15.154 --> 19:17.224
The alleged victim was
sent to Bellevue

19:17.257 --> 19:19.226
for posting violent threats
on the Internet.

19:19.259 --> 19:20.560
He made no mention
of my client.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.795
The boy had suppressed
the facts of his abuse
for three years.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.298
He'd been forbidden
to mention Billy Tripley.

19:25.332 --> 19:27.467
The fact remains that
every sick threat

19:27.500 --> 19:28.868
was proven
to be a fantasy.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.204
Just like the accusations
against my client.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.739
That's for
a jury to decide.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.208
I agree. Anything else?

19:35.242 --> 19:36.476
Motion challenging
the admissibility

19:36.509 --> 19:37.877
of the alleged victim's
complaint.

19:37.910 --> 19:38.745
Didn't we just go over this?

19:38.778 --> 19:39.946
The statement
was taken by
Agent Huang.

19:39.979 --> 19:43.216
JJ thought he was talking
to a psychiatrist, not a cop.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.984
Dr. Huang is a psychiatrist.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.519
But he concealed
his role

19:46.553 --> 19:48.488
as an FBI agent from JJ
and encouraged him

19:48.521 --> 19:50.690
to disclose information
under false pretenses.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.493
This one I'll have
a closer look at.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.363
I'll give you my ruling
next week.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.331
Mr. Zeirko isn't
the only one who knows how

19:58.365 --> 19:59.299
to draft a motion.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.334
It's come to my attention
that the defendant,

20:01.368 --> 20:02.669
who had no trouble
making bail,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.771
has continued to entertain
children at his home.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.406
Mr. Zeirko?

20:06.439 --> 20:09.309
My client had many

20:09.342 --> 20:11.678
charitable functions scheduled
prior to this nightmare.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.846
He opted not to punish thousands
of needy kids

20:13.880 --> 20:15.348
due to the bad behavior of one.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.550
Let's err on
the side of caution.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.553
Until this case is resolved,
he's restricted

20:20.587 --> 20:24.391
to supervised visits with
children under the age of 16.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.894
TRIPLEY:
Isn't he soft?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.696
Very nice.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.400
Tripley, got a call
from one of your neighbors.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.468
Found it very unsettling
to see so many kids

20:35.502 --> 20:36.669
coming through your door.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.305
What's the special
occasion, Billy?

20:38.338 --> 20:39.772
They lower
the age of consent?

20:39.806 --> 20:40.840
That's not funny.

20:40.873 --> 20:41.974
BENSON:
Well, what is funny

20:42.008 --> 20:43.310
is a man in your position

20:43.343 --> 20:44.711
finding reason
to celebrate.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.980
A few of my friends and
associates threw a party
to show their support.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.482
The crowd looks
a little young.

20:49.516 --> 20:51.718
There are plenty of adults here.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.286
Just make sure there's
no sleep-overs.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.054
TRIPLEY
I'd invite you to stay,
Detectives,

20:55.087 --> 20:57.724
but we only want
positive energy here.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.359
You must be wrong about him.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.760
Don't tell me,
he donated

21:00.793 --> 21:03.062
a boatload of cash
to your organization?

21:03.095 --> 21:05.532
Oh, no. I don't belong
to any organization.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.666
I just met him today.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.734
So, how did you

21:07.767 --> 21:08.735
get on the invite list?

21:08.768 --> 21:09.802
He couldn't possibly

21:09.836 --> 21:12.672
be guilty with all
the good things that he's done.

21:12.705 --> 21:15.342
I wrote him a letter thanking
him and he invited us

21:15.375 --> 21:16.743
to this party.
Us?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.478
My granddaughter
April.

21:18.511 --> 21:21.047
April, come here a minute.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.750
Are you having
fun, sweetie?

21:23.783 --> 21:27.354
It's the best day
of my whole life.

21:27.387 --> 21:28.555
Oh, good, good.

21:28.588 --> 21:30.890
What kind of parents would let
their kids around this guy

21:30.923 --> 21:32.325
knowing the
allegations
against him?

21:32.359 --> 21:33.460
They can't tell
he's a freak.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.628
They don't care as long as they
keep getting a handout.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.630
The naive ones are just blinded
by his generosity.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.332
Something tells me
he's been shoveling

21:39.366 --> 21:40.433
more money on his problems.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.468
Now what?

21:41.501 --> 21:44.371
I just left another motion
hearing with Zeirko.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.906
Imagine my surprise
when he handed me this...

21:46.939 --> 21:50.443
The story I told you
about Mr. Tripley was a lie.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.345
He never touched me.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.914
He was never anything
but kind to me.

21:54.947 --> 21:59.051
I apologize for any trouble
my lies may have caused him.

21:59.085 --> 22:01.053
STABLER:
Mr. and Mrs. Ostilow?!

22:01.087 --> 22:04.524
Open up this door
or we'll break it
down again!

22:04.557 --> 22:05.525
What do you want now?

22:05.558 --> 22:06.626
Tripley get to you?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.462
Did he threaten to enforce
the nondisclosure agreement?

22:09.496 --> 22:11.364
If JJ's abuse was
ever discussed,

22:11.398 --> 22:12.399
then you'd have to pay back

22:12.432 --> 22:13.566
all that nice money.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.568
Lower your voices.
People can hear you.

22:15.602 --> 22:17.136
Let us inside then.
We just want a quiet
word with JJ.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.506
He's not here.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.339
Where is he?

22:20.373 --> 22:22.008
He's getting over
this whole mess

22:22.041 --> 22:23.810
in a place you'll
never find him.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.582
How gone is JJ?

22:29.616 --> 22:30.950
He hasn't shown up
for school,

22:30.983 --> 22:33.386
and no one in his apartment
building's seen him.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.854
We pulled the Ostilow's
credit cards.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.656
There's no bus or plane
tickets on 'em.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.991
He's 12 years old.
Someone has to be
taking care of him.

22:39.025 --> 22:39.826
We don't know who.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.528
We have surveillance
on the parents.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.529
They're not paying him
any visits.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.531
They're saying
they sent their
son on vacation.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.398
That's not a crime.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.666
It's called hindering
a prosecution.

22:46.699 --> 22:47.567
That's what I think,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.536
but until I talk to JJ,
I can't prove it.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.637
So, what,

22:50.670 --> 22:52.905
you're just going
to dismiss the case
against Billy?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.707
I don't see what
other option I have.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.576
You're talking
about letting

22:56.609 --> 22:58.077
a pedophile
walk free.

22:58.110 --> 22:59.512
Find one.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.658
I'm not dropping the charges.

23:11.691 --> 23:12.625
I admire
your tenacity.

23:12.659 --> 23:14.427
But you know without
a complaining witness,

23:14.461 --> 23:15.428
your case is over.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.530
Billy Tripley's guilty
of witness tampering.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.731
Can you prove it?

23:18.765 --> 23:19.599
Not yet.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.634
But I know Tripley got
to the parents,

23:21.668 --> 23:24.203
threatened to enforce
the nondisclosure agreement.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.574
Are you absolutely sure
that JJ recanted under duress?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.576
I know that boy was molested.

23:29.609 --> 23:33.613
JJ told Huang he can identify
a birthmark on Billy's penis.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.016
She doesn't get out much.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.050
It's just so frustrating.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.687
If a jury heard the boy's
original statement,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.221
believe me,
they'd put Tripley away.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.456
Well, unfortunately,

23:43.490 --> 23:44.757
the boy's out of the picture

23:44.791 --> 23:46.959
and we can't very well
go around violating

23:46.993 --> 23:50.096
a defendant's eighth amendment
right to face his accuser.

23:50.129 --> 23:51.931
We also can't allow
rich offenders

23:51.964 --> 23:55.602
to buy their way around justice
with nondisclosure agreements.

23:55.635 --> 23:56.536
There's your loophole.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.037
The NDA.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.106
They're always very carefully
worded.

24:00.139 --> 24:02.108
There's never an admission
of guilt.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.544
But there might be mention
of the boy.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.714
And legally, a minor can't enter
into a binding contract.

24:07.747 --> 24:11.117
No, but his parents acting
as his guardians can.

24:11.150 --> 24:12.552
But the question is,
were his parents

24:12.585 --> 24:13.553
acting in his best interest?

24:13.586 --> 24:14.887
If not, that
boy deserves

24:14.921 --> 24:16.122
a lawyer of his own.

24:16.155 --> 24:20.226
And I think I know
just who it should be.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.700
The People request
Jeremy Ostilow Junior

24:27.734 --> 24:29.235
be appointed
a guardian ad litem.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.169
What does that mean?

24:30.202 --> 24:32.539
Is she trying to take away
custody of my son?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.541
No, Mr. Ostilow.
Guardian ad litem

24:34.574 --> 24:36.175
is a person appointed
by the court

24:36.208 --> 24:38.144
to protect the interests
of a minor

24:38.177 --> 24:40.212
for purposes
of legal matters only.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.781
Your Honor, there
is no legal matter.

24:41.814 --> 24:42.915
And if there were,

24:42.949 --> 24:44.917
I've ably represented the
family for several years.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.886
The family-- meaning
the parents, not the child.

24:46.919 --> 24:47.820
Everything I've done

24:47.854 --> 24:49.922
has always been
in my son's best interest.

24:49.956 --> 24:51.958
Everything you've done about
what, Mr. Ostilow?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.893
Are you referring to the
nondisclosure agreement?

24:57.129 --> 24:58.330
Any answer he gives
to that question

24:58.364 --> 25:00.900
would constitute disclosure,
thereby breaching the agreement.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.802
This kind of
circular reasoning
is indicative

25:02.835 --> 25:04.837
of the entire problem,
Your Honor.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.873
The court must step in
for the child.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.576
I'll appoint a law guardian
pro bono.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.043
I'm available, Your Honor.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.746
Mary!

25:13.780 --> 25:15.882
What kind of back-
room deal is this?

25:15.915 --> 25:16.849
The court
would be honored.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.819
Thank you, Joe.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.821
I'm now representing your son,
Mr. Ostilow.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.890
Now, I need a copy of
that agreement made between

25:23.923 --> 25:24.991
you and Mr. Tripley.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.193
Your Honor, this is a blatant
fishing expedition.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.128
MARY:
My client
informed authorities

25:29.161 --> 25:31.030
that that agreement
pertains to him

25:31.063 --> 25:32.965
and it also impinged
on a criminal matter.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.901
LAWYER:
In a statement
he later recanted.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.636
Begging the question why.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.738
Why did you take
him to the lawyer

25:38.771 --> 25:40.006
of the man he'd accused?

25:40.039 --> 25:43.109
And why wouldn't you bring him
in to the police or the A.D.A.?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.977
Because he was scared
to death of them.

25:45.011 --> 25:46.713
They knocked down our door,
arrested him,

25:46.746 --> 25:50.683
interrogated him
and then put him
in a nuthouse.

25:50.717 --> 25:52.018
He just told them
what they wanted to hear.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.653
It was the only way to get them
to leave him alone.

25:53.686 --> 25:54.687
Let me ask

25:54.721 --> 25:55.655
one more question.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.357
Why, if Jeremy recanted
of his own volition,

25:58.390 --> 25:59.759
are you hiding him?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.694
I'm not.
He just needed to get away.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.263
Isn't it so he can't
testify against
Billy Tripley?

26:04.296 --> 26:05.598
No.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.867
Mind if I ask him that myself?

26:07.900 --> 26:09.802
You're not going
to talk to him.
In that case,

26:09.836 --> 26:11.704
I request a Material Witness
Order to produce the child.

26:11.738 --> 26:14.006
Your Honor, she's overreaching.

26:14.040 --> 26:16.008
No, but she's
right at the line.

26:16.042 --> 26:17.977
I want the boy produced
in my chambers.

26:18.010 --> 26:21.147
I'm going to talk to him alone,
and then I'll make a decision.

26:21.180 --> 26:24.316
No.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.018
Sir, if you refuse to comply,

26:26.052 --> 26:29.055
I'll be forced to find you
in contempt of court.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.191
You don't want to go to jail,
do you, Mr. Ostilow?

26:34.927 --> 26:36.663
They actually
put him in jail?

26:36.696 --> 26:37.997
He's playing the martyr.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.032
Claims he's protecting
his son.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.300
He's protecting his millions.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.002
JJ testifies,
he loses everything.

26:43.035 --> 26:44.937
Gives him a big incentive
to sit tight.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.138
I'll see that he sits there

26:46.172 --> 26:47.874
till the boy turns 21
if I have to.

26:47.907 --> 26:49.241
They didn't call her
"hanging judge" for nothing.

26:49.275 --> 26:51.010
Who? Who called me that?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.011
No one.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.012
Why wait for Dad?

26:53.045 --> 26:54.013
Let's find JJ
ourselves.

26:54.046 --> 26:54.981
We're doing the best
we can.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.049
We've pulled the phone
and credit card records.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.017
So far, nothing, so...

26:58.050 --> 27:00.052
I tell you
the good thing
about working

27:00.086 --> 27:00.953
for a rich
law firm.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.989
We've got resources
you civil servants

27:03.022 --> 27:04.223
can't even dream about.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.026
Including a slew of P.I.s
on retainer.

27:07.059 --> 27:09.295
They're at your disposal.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.832
Billy Tripley's PR machine
is painting JJ

27:12.865 --> 27:14.801
as a pathological liar.

27:14.834 --> 27:18.805
We still can't find JJ.

27:18.838 --> 27:20.106
Detective Benson?

27:20.139 --> 27:21.107
Yeah.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.009
They said I should talk to you.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.877
Why don't you have a seat?

27:24.911 --> 27:26.312
Thank you.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.950
How can I help you?

27:30.983 --> 27:33.019
I run a program
for terminal patients.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.687
Doing what, exactly?

27:34.721 --> 27:36.288
Preparing them
for death.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.256
I'm a therapist.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.992
This morning I counseled
a nine-year-old girl

27:40.026 --> 27:41.093
dying of leukemia.

27:41.127 --> 27:42.729
That must be hard.

27:42.762 --> 27:43.863
It gets worse.

27:43.896 --> 27:47.967
I believe she was sexually
molested by Billy Tripley.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.104
WOMAN:
It's all my fault.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.172
I don't know how

27:53.205 --> 27:54.974
I could have been
so stupid!

27:55.007 --> 27:57.009
You got me.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.812
You left your granddaughter
alone with this man?

27:59.846 --> 28:01.047
We've seen him twice

28:01.080 --> 28:03.049
since we met you.

28:03.082 --> 28:05.918
Two days ago he threw a party
for kids just like April.

28:05.952 --> 28:07.286
She's got leukemia.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.055
Diagnosed a year ago.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.091
Nothing the doctors
are doing seems to be helping.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.961
So I'm searching
for alternative cures.

28:14.994 --> 28:16.495
Where are April's parents?

28:16.528 --> 28:17.363
I don't know.

28:17.396 --> 28:22.501
There never was a father
in the picture.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.403
My daughter got mixed up
with drugs.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.006
Abandoned April
right after she was born.

28:27.039 --> 28:27.907
I'm all she has.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.377
We're going to need
to talk to April.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.881
She had chemo this morning.
She's in maintenance.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.949
Gets it every two
or three weeks.

28:36.983 --> 28:39.151
She threw up all afternoon,

28:39.185 --> 28:42.188
and, well, she fell asleep
an hour ago.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.122
BENSON:
Thank you.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.859
There you go.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.995
I don't know
if I can keep it down.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.396
Oh, honey,
try just a little.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.832
We don't want you
dehydrating again.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.233
We'll just talk

28:54.266 --> 28:58.237
as long you feel
up to it, okay April?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.206
So, can you tell me
what happened

29:00.239 --> 29:01.941
at Billy Tripley's house?

29:01.974 --> 29:03.509
There were lots
of kids there.

29:03.542 --> 29:07.513
We played games.
Really fun ones.

29:07.546 --> 29:09.448
Hide-and-seek and stuff.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.518
She got overexcited.
Wore herself out.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.221
Tell her what Billy said to you.

29:15.254 --> 29:17.089
That I could take a nap.

29:17.123 --> 29:20.126
He said kids took naps
there all the time.

29:20.159 --> 29:22.094
And did he take you someplace
to lie down?

29:22.128 --> 29:26.432
A place just for special kids.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.935
Did Billy have
a name for it?

29:30.970 --> 29:33.205
The Treasure Room.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.310
Okay.
What happened there, April?

29:38.344 --> 29:40.947
He said if I was good,

29:40.980 --> 29:44.216
I got to pick a present
out of the treasure chest.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.052
Did you get to pick a toy?

29:47.253 --> 29:48.387
He said she
could have it

29:48.420 --> 29:50.156
after the nap.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.091
He didn't want her to wrinkle
her pretty outfit.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.160
He had pajamas she could wear.

29:54.193 --> 29:55.127
He took her clothes off!

29:55.161 --> 29:56.262
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Hodges.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.097
I understand how difficult
this is,

29:58.130 --> 30:00.799
but I really need
to hear it from April, okay?

30:03.135 --> 30:04.837
Thank you.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.140
Honey, your nose is bleeding.

30:08.174 --> 30:10.276
I'm sorry.

30:10.309 --> 30:12.344
This happens
all the time.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.116
Not that I wish it
on anybody else,

30:17.149 --> 30:19.151
but why did it have
to be this girl?

30:19.185 --> 30:20.452
Children with any disability

30:20.486 --> 30:22.855
are twice as likely
to be sexually abused.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.924
Cowards always target
the weakest prey.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.126
They're more
likely to comply,
less likely to report.

30:27.159 --> 30:30.229
And Billy's been around
hundreds of terminally ill kids.

30:30.262 --> 30:31.430
Makes you wonder
how many died

30:31.463 --> 30:32.698
before reporting abuse.

30:32.731 --> 30:36.202
I knew he'd have other victims.
I just wasn't expecting a girl.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.238
Sexually indiscriminate
pedophiles aren't uncommon.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.107
His victims are
all prepubescent.

30:41.140 --> 30:43.910
There's less anatomical
differences at that age.

30:43.943 --> 30:47.146
It's more about the
hairlessness, the innocence.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.514
Billy's pretty childlike
himself.

30:48.547 --> 30:49.581
Look at his lifestyle.

30:49.615 --> 30:52.151
He lives in a magical toyland
playing with kids.

30:52.184 --> 30:55.254
It's the Peter Pan Syndrome
to the extreme.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.658
TRIPLEY:
Look, that really hurts.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.659
Oh, come on!

31:00.692 --> 31:05.097
Are you going to pull out
every hair on my head?

31:05.131 --> 31:07.233
Have to make sure we get one
with the root attached.

31:07.266 --> 31:10.169
Ten hairs
is standard procedure.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.670
Look, this is police brutality.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.539
STABLER:
Trust me, when
you're being

31:13.572 --> 31:16.075
brutalized by me,
you'll know it.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.276
You just threatened me.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.610
Did you hear him threaten me?

31:18.644 --> 31:20.012
Nope.

31:20.046 --> 31:22.181
Open wide.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.515
And if you bite me,
I'll hurt you.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.084
What's that for?

31:25.117 --> 31:27.954
Oral swab.
No pain involved.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.255
You know,
if you can't take pain,

31:29.288 --> 31:31.423
you shouldn't go around
molesting nine-year-olds.

31:31.457 --> 31:33.960
I never touched her.
Not that way.

31:33.993 --> 31:37.263
Nap time? The Treasure Room?

31:37.296 --> 31:40.232
I can't bring myself
to go back in that room

31:40.266 --> 31:42.334
since you people desecrated it.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.270
Please lower your pants
and underwear.

31:44.303 --> 31:45.537
Why?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.273
Pubic hair sample.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.375
I need ten of those as well.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.479
I don't have any.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.347
Any what?

31:55.381 --> 31:57.216
Hair...

31:57.249 --> 32:00.119
down there.

32:00.152 --> 32:03.055
Stand up and strip.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.035
WARNER:
Hmm.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.337
Guess we can wait
till they grow back.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.571
It's permanent.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.273
I had laser hair removal.

32:28.180 --> 32:29.715
It just gets freakier
and freakier.

32:29.748 --> 32:31.417
Notice where
his birthmark is?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.052
Right where JJ
said it would be.

32:33.085 --> 32:34.320
Now if only we could
find JJ.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.022
I got a call
from the investigator

32:36.055 --> 32:36.855
Conway Clark gave us.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.457
He might have picked up
JJ's trail.

32:38.490 --> 32:39.625
Where does he
think he is?

32:39.658 --> 32:41.260
Maine. Clark's sending him
up there now.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.528
April mention any birthmarks?

32:42.561 --> 32:44.330
Nope. She had
her eyes closed tight.

32:44.363 --> 32:46.432
Have you seen
Tripley's bombshell?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.467
STABLER:
It's more like
a firecracker.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.468
His legal team
put a P.I. on Nora.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.337
Followed her and April
into a department store

32:51.370 --> 32:52.338
where he alerted security.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.440
For what?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.042
"Toy mogul's alleged

32:56.075 --> 32:58.477
victim caught with
shoplifting granny."

32:58.510 --> 33:01.480
So much for our perfect witness.

33:01.513 --> 33:02.648
It's not like it sounds.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.216
Let me show you
how it looks.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.484
Tripley's private investigator

33:05.517 --> 33:07.286
took a pretty clear
picture of it.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.354
That's $200 worth

33:08.387 --> 33:11.323
of merchandise you're stuffing
in your bag there.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.424
Yes, it was all for April.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.292
She needed clothes.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.794
Well, that's no reason
to steal them.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.595
I had to.

33:16.628 --> 33:19.165
Her medical bills
have wiped me out.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.200
I can't work because she's sick
all the time.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.301
I didn't know what else to do.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.471
Tripley's lawyers are having
a field day with this.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.806
They can't punish April
for my mistake.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.241
They already have.

33:29.275 --> 33:30.442
It's in the papers.

33:32.511 --> 33:35.647
My granddaughter has had
a miserable life.

33:35.681 --> 33:39.418
Both her parents abandoned her,
she's dying of cancer,

33:39.451 --> 33:41.487
and now she's been molested.

33:41.520 --> 33:47.526
Please... let her know justice
at least once in her life.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.528
NOVAK:
Grandma muddied
the case big time.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.463
Luckily she's not the victim,
April is.

33:51.497 --> 33:54.100
You couldn't ask for a more
sympathetic witness.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.534
But I could ask
for a second one.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.437
If a jury heard it from April
and JJ, it'd be a lock.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.839
I take it Mr. Ostilow is
still sitting in his cell?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.474
Yeah, maintaining his vow
of silence.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.843
Clark's private
investigator made
it to Maine.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.345
Thinks he's got
a bead on JJ.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.846
What about April's rape kit?

34:07.879 --> 34:10.449
Warner's still waiting
for the final results,

34:10.482 --> 34:12.651
but she found a hair
in the girl's underwear.

34:12.684 --> 34:14.453
Made a preliminary
match to Billy.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.388
I heard he had
no hairs to leave.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.189
It's from his head.

34:17.223 --> 34:20.359
Let me know when
the full kit's back.

34:20.392 --> 34:22.794
I need all the evidence
I can get.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.398
I found something
that doesn't make sense.

34:26.432 --> 34:27.466
So, is that good or bad?

34:27.499 --> 34:30.336
As part of the kit, I drew
blood to check for STDs.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.471
Please don't tell me
he gave her something.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.140
This kid cannot
take another hit.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.875
No. The CBC and differential
came back absolutely normal.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.110
So, that's a good thing.

34:38.144 --> 34:39.411
Yes, and
that's the point.

34:39.445 --> 34:42.214
Leukemia affects
the white blood cells.

34:42.248 --> 34:45.284
I expected to find
abnormal metamyelocytes.

34:45.317 --> 34:46.785
So I checked the smear.

34:46.818 --> 34:47.853
Still nothing.

34:47.886 --> 34:50.756
Meaning no sign
of cancer?

34:50.789 --> 34:52.124
None.

34:52.158 --> 34:54.426
Well, could she
be in remission?

34:54.460 --> 34:55.394
It's a possibility.

34:55.427 --> 34:58.130
But when leukemia is diagnosed
in a child,

34:58.164 --> 35:01.267
the pediatric oncologist
takes a bone marrow biopsy

35:01.300 --> 35:02.434
to confirm it.

35:02.468 --> 35:06.138
It's done by drilling small
holes in the pelvic bone.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.206
They don't heal.

35:07.239 --> 35:10.476
This is a pelvis after a biopsy.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.710
See the holes?

35:11.743 --> 35:17.683
As part of April's rape trauma
exam, I took a pelvic x-ray.

35:17.716 --> 35:21.187
BENSON:
No holes. They didn't do

35:21.220 --> 35:22.721
a bone marrow biopsy.

35:22.754 --> 35:25.624
She never had cancer.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.797
It's a good thing you brought
her in when you did.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.266
Another few weeks,
she'd have been dead.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.701
What's wrong with her?

35:35.734 --> 35:37.236
Mercury poisoning.

35:37.269 --> 35:38.103
What?

35:38.136 --> 35:39.705
There's a toxic level
in her system.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.340
Well, how was she
exposed to mercury?

35:41.373 --> 35:42.341
Ingested it.

35:42.374 --> 35:43.675
Probably put in her food.

35:43.709 --> 35:44.576
Nora.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.678
She was killing her
own granddaughter.

35:46.712 --> 35:48.314
And judging by these levels,

35:48.347 --> 35:49.915
I'd say for almost a year now.

35:49.948 --> 35:50.816
I don't understand.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.452
She was going to doctors
for chemotherapy.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.453
No, she wasn't.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.787
Her grandmother
convinced her

35:55.821 --> 35:57.556
they couldn't
afford a doctor.

35:57.589 --> 36:00.292
Told her she was
giving her the
medicine she needed,

36:00.326 --> 36:01.693
but it had to be their secret.

36:01.727 --> 36:03.962
STABLER:
The medicine was
actually the mercury

36:03.995 --> 36:05.397
which was making her sick?

36:05.431 --> 36:06.565
So let me guess.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.900
Leukemia and mercury poisoning
have the same side effects.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.236
Both inhibit cell growth.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.737
Same nausea, hair loss,
weight loss...

36:11.770 --> 36:13.639
April honestly believed
she was dying.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.707
Is she going
to be okay now?

36:15.741 --> 36:17.643
Mercury weakens the bones,

36:17.676 --> 36:19.978
so some of the damage
is permanent.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.847
But at least she'll live.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.750
You're going to start
feeling better now.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.753
They told me Gran's the one
who made me sick.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.455
BENSON:
I'm sorry, April.

36:29.488 --> 36:33.259
Looks like your gran
did a lot of bad things.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.394
She lied about the leukemia.

36:35.427 --> 36:38.697
Has she lied about other things
that you know about?

36:41.333 --> 36:44.536
The stuff I told you
about Billy.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.805
Okay, was
any of it true?

36:46.838 --> 36:50.776
Gran told me to make friends
with him.

36:50.809 --> 36:55.314
I took a nap there once,
but just on the couch.

36:55.347 --> 36:59.818
Well, you sure knew
a lot of details.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.420
How did you know what to say?

37:01.453 --> 37:03.322
Gran read all the stories
about him

37:03.355 --> 37:04.623
in the papers.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.024
She cut them out.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.826
Made a scrapbook.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.862
She quizzed me from it
every day.

37:10.896 --> 37:14.366
Do you know where she keeps it?

37:14.400 --> 37:15.734
In the kitchen.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.270
Between her cookbooks.

37:18.304 --> 37:20.306
April, we know that

37:20.339 --> 37:22.741
you didn't want to do it.

37:22.774 --> 37:26.812
She said it was my only chance.

37:26.845 --> 37:30.782
If we didn't get the money,
I'd die.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.719
I just didn't want to die.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.522
Sweetheart, you're not going to.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.557
Gran said she loved me.

37:38.590 --> 37:45.764
But how could she make me sick
if she loved me?

37:52.338 --> 37:54.773
NORA:
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.074
I love that little girl.

37:56.107 --> 37:57.576
Funny way of showing it.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.844
I never wanted to hurt her.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.879
There must be something
wrong with me.

38:00.912 --> 38:02.047
There is.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.915
It's called Munchausen
by Proxy syndrome.

38:03.949 --> 38:04.683
What is that?

38:04.716 --> 38:08.053
A recognized
psychological disorder

38:08.086 --> 38:10.021
that causes a parent to make
their child sick

38:10.055 --> 38:11.990
because of a pathological need
for attention.

38:12.023 --> 38:15.794
So, let's talk about
the Tripley scam.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.330
Well, that was April's lie.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.965
And I believed it.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.969
We have the scrapbook.

38:34.446 --> 38:38.917
Well, it's not as though
he's an innocent victim, is it?

38:38.950 --> 38:40.686
He's a pedophile.

38:40.719 --> 38:41.720
He deserved it.

38:41.753 --> 38:45.090
I'd just as soon clear this
one off the books.

38:45.123 --> 38:46.625
So fill in the blanks

38:46.658 --> 38:48.860
and I won't charge
you with the fraud counts

38:48.894 --> 38:49.961
related to it.

38:56.134 --> 38:59.371
It sounds like you know
everything already.

38:59.405 --> 39:04.009
Crime lab found a hair
in April's underwear.

39:04.042 --> 39:08.113
During the party I snuck
into his room,

39:08.146 --> 39:10.516
and I took it
from his hairbrush.

39:10.549 --> 39:13.952
When they asked me for the
clothes she'd been wearing,

39:13.985 --> 39:15.754
I'd already planted it.

39:15.787 --> 39:19.625
Do you have any idea how much
damage you've caused?

39:19.658 --> 39:21.893
But you agree with me;
he deserved it.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.462
He deserves
to go to jail.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.030
Thanks to you he can claim

39:25.063 --> 39:26.898
he's the victim
of a false allegation

39:26.932 --> 39:29.968
every time a legitimate one
comes up in the future.

39:31.837 --> 39:34.406
I'm sorry.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.541
I don't believe you.

39:35.574 --> 39:38.877
But you'll have a good long time
to pay for it in prison.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.512
We just made a deal.

39:40.546 --> 39:43.615
I'm not charging her
with fraud on Tripley,

39:43.649 --> 39:45.917
I'm charging her with fraud
on the cancer scam.

39:45.951 --> 39:47.018
Munchausen.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.520
Bull. She's been
working this for a year.

39:48.554 --> 39:51.056
Totaling all the bake sales,
canister donations

39:51.089 --> 39:52.891
and Internet
solicitations,

39:52.924 --> 39:55.026
she's bilked people
out of 60 grand.

39:55.060 --> 39:55.894
What are
you offering?

39:55.927 --> 39:56.928
Not a thing.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.030
I'm taking you to trial.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.165
Please, please, think of April.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.167
There's no one else
to look after her.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.669
You've got to
be kidding me.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.537
What you were doing nearly
killed her.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.973
I'm charging you with fraud
and attempted murder.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.509
But you heard what she said,
I'm sick.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.211
No jury's that stupid.

40:13.244 --> 40:17.649
They'll see it wasn't
Munchausen.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.918
Just pure, unadulterated greed.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.059
Well, we found JJ.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.060
Where?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.896
He was with an uncle
up in Maine.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.898
My P.I. got close,
but just missed him.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.900
What happened?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.768
They crossed the border
into Canada.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.604
The material witness order
doesn't extend that far.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.939
I don't have the authority
to bring him back.

40:40.972 --> 40:41.973
FIN:
Unbelievable.

40:42.007 --> 40:42.974
Two cases against Billy,

40:43.008 --> 40:44.710
and both of
them blown up.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.044
He's a Teflon pedophile.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.479
What happens with JJ's father?

40:47.513 --> 40:48.980
Well, now we know
where JJ is,

40:49.014 --> 40:50.549
I'll have to
notify the court.

40:50.582 --> 40:51.817
Oh, that's nice.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.485
He gets out of jail
and keeps the money, huh?

40:53.519 --> 40:54.786
CLARK:
Oh, no.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.588
Sending his son
out of our jurisdiction

40:56.622 --> 40:57.789
does not vacate the order.

40:57.823 --> 41:00.258
Until he produces that kid,
I'm keeping his ass in jail.

41:00.291 --> 41:04.663
This you got to see to believe.

41:05.697 --> 41:07.265
Billy is having a victory party.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.801
WOMAN:
Billy, do you harbor
any resentment?

41:09.835 --> 41:10.836
He invited the media?

41:10.869 --> 41:13.939
I do feel sorry for
that little girl, though.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.141
She was as much
a victim as I was.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.209
The mood in here
is pretty festive.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.979
I've been vindicated.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.981
But the real winners
are the children.

41:23.014 --> 41:25.917
One of these kids is going
to be his next victim.

41:25.951 --> 41:28.754
It's sick.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.255
We'll get him.

41:30.288 --> 41:33.992
He'll give us a lot
more chances.

41:34.025 --> 41:36.662
( cheering )

41:42.133 --> 41:44.536
Who's your favorite toy maker?

41:44.570 --> 41:46.538
ALL:
You!
