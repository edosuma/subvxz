WEBVTT

00:05.773 --> 00:08.309
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY, ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.409 --> 00:10.711
YOU SAID THAT
ENDING THE THERAPY

00:10.811 --> 00:12.146
WAS THE BEST GOOD SOLUTION.

00:12.246 --> 00:15.015
I SAID IT MIGHT BE
NECESSARY FOR HER SAKE.

00:15.116 --> 00:16.484
WHEN YOU SAY
"GOOD SOLUTION,"

00:16.584 --> 00:19.187
I THINK YOU MEAN A SOLUTION
TO YOUR PROBLEMS.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.922
ALEX, THE FIGHTER PILOT,
MET LAURA.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.226
SO HE COMES
BACK THE NEXT AFTERNOON,
TELLS ME THAT THEY MET

00:25.326 --> 00:28.762
AND NOW--
AND NOW THEY'RE DATING.

00:30.764 --> 00:33.234
YOU WANT ME TO
TALK ABOUT LAURA?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

00:33.334 --> 00:36.870
THAT I SIT OPPOSITE HER
AND SAY, "WHAT IF?"

00:36.970 --> 00:38.672
WELL, I DO.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.443
( knocking )

00:50.184 --> 00:51.985
- HI.
- HI.

00:52.086 --> 00:55.123
SORRY I'M LATE.
I WAS AT THE MARKET.

00:55.223 --> 00:58.859
LISTEN, WOULD YOU MIND
PUTTING THESE IN THE FRIDGE
FOR ME, PLEASE?

00:58.959 --> 01:01.395
- SURE, SURE.
- FISH HEADS.

01:01.495 --> 01:04.465
- THEY'RE FISH HEADS?
- MMM.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.200
YEAH, I'M MAKING
SOME CHOWDER.

01:06.300 --> 01:10.070
OH. FISH HEADS
FOR-- YEAH.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.772
THANKS.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.108
( theme music playing )

01:32.126 --> 01:34.295
OKAY.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.730
I REALLY LIKE YOUR DRESS.

01:38.031 --> 01:40.468
- THANK YOU.
- MMM.

01:40.568 --> 01:45.105
AND YOUR HAIR
LOOKS DIFFERENT.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.407
- YOU LOOK GREAT, GINA.
- ( water pouring )

01:46.507 --> 01:48.209
THAT'S GOOD OF YOU
TO SAY THAT.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.144
MAKES YOU LOOK,

01:50.244 --> 01:53.013
I DON'T KNOW,
SOFTER SOMEHOW.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.448
SPECIAL OCCASION?

01:54.548 --> 01:57.851
SOFTER?
THAT'S INTERESTING.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.420
I'M GOING OUT
WITH FRIENDS.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.990
LET ME GUESS,
BUNCH OF SHRINKS?

02:03.090 --> 02:05.293
( laughs )
YES AND I'M GONNA TELL THEM

02:05.393 --> 02:07.461
THAT YOU BROUGHT ME
TWO BAGS OF FISH HEADS.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.199
- ( laughs )
- YES, MOST OF THEM
ARE SHRINKS.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.767
AND THE NON-SHRINKS
WILL THINK

02:13.867 --> 02:15.936
YOU'RE ANALYZING THEM,
WHICH, OF COURSE, YOU WILL BE.

02:16.036 --> 02:19.072
MMM.

02:19.173 --> 02:22.843
DO YOU KNOW WHO'S BEEN
ON MY MIND LATELY?

02:24.178 --> 02:27.415
- DORIS.
- FROM THE INSTITUTE?

02:27.515 --> 02:29.483
- ARE YOU IN TOUCH?
- WELL, SORT OF.

02:29.583 --> 02:32.786
SHE'S JUST GOTTEN
DIVORCED AGAIN.

02:32.886 --> 02:36.590
SHE LEFT THIS DENTIST
WHO WAS A CHRONIC CHEAT

02:36.690 --> 02:40.160
AND NOW SHE'S WITH THIS
WHINY, SOURPUSS DOCTOR.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.630
SUCH AN OBVIOUS REACTION.
YOU'D THINK AS A SHRINK,

02:42.730 --> 02:44.632
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE ABLE
TO AVOID THAT KIND OF THING.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.568
EASIER TO SEE PATTERNS
WHEN THEY'RE NOT OURS.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.937
OR WE SEE THEM
BUT WE CAN'T AVOID THEM.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.705
THAT'S WORSE.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.745
YOU KNOW, DORIS HAD A--

02:57.845 --> 03:00.848
SHE HAD A BIT
OF A THING FOR ME
BACK IN THE DAY.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.616
- DID SHE?
- YEAH.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.886
SHE USED TO SAY
SHE WAS CRAZY ABOUT ME.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.422
BUT I NEVER SLEPT WITH HER.
I ALWAYS HAD THIS FEELING
THAT IF I DID,

03:08.522 --> 03:11.825
SHE'D SOMEHOW,
I DON'T KNOW,

03:11.925 --> 03:13.561
USE IT AGAINST ME

03:13.661 --> 03:15.996
OR SAY I WAS USING
HER OR SOMETHING.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.965
SHE WAS LIKE THAT.
EXTREMES.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.300
BUT HOT.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.203
NOT SUCH USEFUL QUALITIES
FOR A THERAPIST.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.306
YOU DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S
A GOOD THERAPIST.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.076
I'M NO GOOD EITHER,
REMEMBER?

03:29.176 --> 03:32.380
ISN'T THAT
HOW WE LEFT OFF?

03:32.480 --> 03:34.815
SHOULD WE TALK ABOUT
OUR LAST SESSION?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.850
SHOULD WE?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.353
I WILL SAY THAT IT'S NOT
THE FIRST TIME I'VE LEFT HERE

03:39.453 --> 03:40.988
DISAPPOINTED OR ANGRY.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.790
IF I WAS YOU,
I'D LOOK INTO THAT.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.628
OF COURSE, I'M ANGRY
AT EVERYTHING THESE DAYS.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.432
MORE OR LESS ALL THE TIME.
THIS WEEK WAS PARTICULARLY...

03:53.200 --> 03:55.936
- WHAT?
- THE GIRL GYMNAST...

03:57.305 --> 03:58.472
TOOK A BUNCH OF PILLS

03:58.572 --> 04:01.542
AND COLLAPSED IN MY OFFICE.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.512
- PILLS TO GET HIGH?
- NO, SLEEPING PILLS.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.381
TRIED TO DO HERSELF IN.
ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.784
- OH GOD, PAUL.
- WELL, SORT OF.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.786
CHOOSING MY OFFICE...

04:12.886 --> 04:16.223
THERE ARE MORE EFFICIENT PLACES
TO KILL YOURSELF, I MUST SAY.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.859
BUT SHE WAS
ACTING OUT AND...

04:18.959 --> 04:21.228
GOT TO SAY IT RATTLED ME.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.130
SHE TOOK THE PILLS
BEFORE THE SESSION?

04:23.230 --> 04:25.766
I HAD THEM,
REALLY STUPIDLY--

04:25.866 --> 04:28.101
I NEVER HAVE PILLS
IN MY BATHROOM.

04:28.201 --> 04:31.672
BUT I'M SLEEPING ON THE COUCH
SO I'D BROUGHT SOME STUFF DOWN.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.576
SHE MANAGED TO GET DOWN
MOST OF THE BOTTLE.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.778
IS SHE OKAY?

04:37.878 --> 04:39.347
SHE IS.

04:39.447 --> 04:42.616
I CALLED THE PSYCHIATRIST
WHO'S A FRIEND OF MINE

04:42.716 --> 04:46.487
AND I ASKED HIM NOT
TO HAVE HER COMMITTED.

04:48.155 --> 04:50.090
DO YOU FEEL
PRETTY SURE SHE'S SAFE?

04:50.190 --> 04:51.959
MM-HMM.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.461
I THINK SHE WOULD'VE
BEEN CRUSHED

04:53.561 --> 04:55.729
IF SHE THOUGHT
THAT I'D ABANDONED HER--

04:55.829 --> 04:59.367
YOU KNOW, THE PARENTAL FIGURE
PASSING HER ON TO SOMEBODY ELSE.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.635
I HAVE A FEELING
THAT'S WHY SHE TOOK THE PILLS

05:01.735 --> 05:03.937
IN THE FIRST PLACE,
TO KIND OF TEST

05:04.037 --> 05:07.675
MY COMMITMENT TO HER.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.143
ARE YOU FEELING GUILTY?

05:10.243 --> 05:14.715
NO, BUT I DO
REGRET THOSE PILLS.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.717
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY
TO KILL YOURSELF.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.554
TRUE. NO, I DON'T
FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.690
THE STRANGE THING IS
WE HAD BEEN

05:22.790 --> 05:24.658
MAKING A LOT
OF PROGRESS LATELY.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.595
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE'D
HAD SEX WITH THIS BOY

05:27.695 --> 05:31.098
AND HE TOLD HER THAT
SHE FUCKED LIKE SOMEBODY

05:31.198 --> 05:32.366
WHO'D BEEN ABUSED.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.302
AMAZINGLY INSENSITIVE
DUMB KID

05:35.403 --> 05:36.804
TRYING TO COVER
HIS OWN INSECURITY,

05:36.904 --> 05:40.240
BUT, CHRIST,
IT MADE ME SO ANGRY.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.710
NORMALLY,
I NEVER SAY ANYTHING.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.746
- BUT YOU DID?
- I DID.
I CALLED HIM AN IDIOT.

05:45.846 --> 05:46.947
HOW DID SHE REACT?

05:47.047 --> 05:49.817
IF SHE HEARD,
SHE DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE IT.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.422
BUT A MOMENT LATER
SHE HAD THIS...

05:54.522 --> 05:56.624
MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.727
SHE STARTED TO REMEMBER
DETAILS OF THE ACCIDENT.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.730
I MEAN, IT WAS A CRUCIAL
THERAPEUTIC BREAKTHROUGH.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.566
I FELT WE WERE
REALLY GETTING SOMEWHERE.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.770
THEN SHE JUST UPPED
AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

06:14.274 --> 06:17.177
YOU THINK YOU'RE MORE EFFECTIVE
WHEN YOU'RE INVOLVED?

06:17.277 --> 06:19.079
WHEN YOU SHOW A PATIENT
YOUR FEELINGS?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.981
MAYBE,
I DON'T KNOW.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.817
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M
REALLY SAYING HERE, GINA.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.753
NO?

06:25.853 --> 06:28.088
WOULD YOU STOP DRAWING
CONCLUSIONS, GINA?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.023
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY WEEK.

06:32.426 --> 06:35.529
LET'S SEE, UM,
IN OTHER NEWS, UH...

06:35.629 --> 06:39.767
KATE TOOK HER AFFAIR
TO ROME THIS WEEK.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.572
WHEN SOPHIE COLLAPSED
IN MY OFFICE

06:44.672 --> 06:46.574
I YELLED OUT FOR KATE,

06:46.674 --> 06:50.110
THEN REALIZED I WAS
ALONE IN THE HOUSE.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.079
I WAS THE ONLY ONE THERE.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.383
DID YOU AND KATE
DISCUSS ANYTHING?

06:56.484 --> 06:58.452
SHE DIDN'T TRY
TO GET ME TO STOP HER.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.490
SHE JUST MADE
A CALL TO WORK

07:02.590 --> 07:06.059
AND PACKED HER BAG
AND OFF SHE WENT.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.461
YOU WEREN'T SURPRISED?

07:07.561 --> 07:09.463
NOT REALLY.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.700
THAT'S THE WAY
KATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.368
I MEAN THAT WAS ONE OF
THE THINGS I FELL IN LOVE WITH--

07:15.469 --> 07:18.071
THE FACT THAT SHE JUST
MADE UP HER MIND

07:18.171 --> 07:21.141
AND JUST DID WHATEVER

07:21.241 --> 07:23.811
SHE WAS DETERMINED TO DO.

07:25.412 --> 07:28.649
SO UNLIKE MY MOTHER,
YOU KNOW?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.651
I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS
I MARRIED KATE

07:30.751 --> 07:32.352
WAS TO GET BACK
AT MY MOTHER,

07:32.452 --> 07:33.754
BECAUSE IT WAS
SOME KIND OF STRIKE

07:33.854 --> 07:36.056
AGAINST THAT
WHOLE NOTION OF...

07:36.156 --> 07:38.692
I DON'T KNOW,
VICTIMHOOD.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.894
ONE THING YOU CAN
SAY ABOUT KATE

07:40.994 --> 07:43.564
IS SHE NEVER PLAYED
THE VICTIM.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.599
SHE MAKES UP HER MIND
TO GO TO ROME,

07:45.699 --> 07:47.568
SHE GOES TO ROME.

07:52.339 --> 07:55.208
IT'S BEEN 18 YEARS SINCE
I'VE BEEN ALONE IN THAT HOUSE.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.410
ROSIE'S AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND

07:57.511 --> 08:01.214
AND MAX
IS WITH KATE'S MOM.

08:03.517 --> 08:06.153
I'VE GOT THE WHOLE HOUSE
TO MYSELF.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.421
HOW IS THAT?

08:08.522 --> 08:12.159
WEIRD.

08:12.259 --> 08:15.162
ANYWAY, I'M HOPING
WITH, UH--

08:15.262 --> 08:18.465
WITH MY FISH CHOWDER
AND A BOTTLE OF GOOD WINE,
I'LL GET LUCKY.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.701
RIGHT.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.035
YOU THINK I'M JOKING

08:22.135 --> 08:24.404
BUT I DO MAKE A MEAN
CHOWDER, I HAVE TO SAY.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.540
- ( laughs )
- I START WITH THE BROTH

08:26.640 --> 08:28.642
THEN THE VEGETABLES
AND THE FILLETS.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.644
I STEAM THE LEEKS
AND THE CARROTS,

08:30.744 --> 08:32.713
A FEW OTHER THINGS.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.415
MIX THEM ALL TOGETHER,
LEAVE IT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES--

08:35.515 --> 08:38.385
DELICIOUS.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.755
THE SMELL ALWAYS
MADE KATE SICK.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.257
SHE COULD NEVER STAND IT.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.293
I HAVE TO SAY
I LOVE IT.

08:46.393 --> 08:47.961
DO YOU LIKE CHOWDER?

08:48.061 --> 08:49.429
I DO.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.398
WELL, MAYBE I'LL HAVE
A LITTLE PARTY,

08:51.498 --> 08:53.567
INVITE A COUPLE
OF PEOPLE OVER.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.904
I COULD INVITE, UH--
I COULD INVITE DORIS.

08:58.005 --> 09:01.074
HOW LONG IS IT
SINCE YOU'VE SEEN HER?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.976
OH, UH...

09:04.177 --> 09:06.113
THE CAREFREE DAYS
OF THE INSTITUTE.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.380
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.950
WOULD YOU INVITE
HER HUSBAND?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.184
ARE YOU KIDDING?

09:11.284 --> 09:13.253
IT'LL SAY IN THE INVITE,

09:13.353 --> 09:15.288
"NO SOURPUSSES, PLEASE."

09:15.388 --> 09:17.257
JUST DORIS MESSLER
AND YOU.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.859
AND YOU.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.061
- I'M INVITED?
- MM-HMM.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.562
YOU CAN WEAR
THAT DRESS IF YOU WANT.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.497
OH, WELL, THANK YOU,

09:24.598 --> 09:25.966
BUT I THINK I'D
JUST BE IN THE WAY.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.235
NO, YOU WOULDN'T.
YOU'RE MY COVER.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.404
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.
I'LL TELL HER YOU'RE COMING,

09:31.504 --> 09:33.006
HOW GREAT IT WOULD BE
IF SHE CAME TOO.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.143
IT WOULD BE LIKE
AN INSTITUTE REUNION.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.678
( laughs )

09:37.778 --> 09:40.580
AND THEN I LEAVE
AND YOU'RE ALONE WITH HER.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.116
PERFECT.
IT'S A PERFECT PLAN.
CAN'T FAIL.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.787
YOU'RE IN A CHIPPER MOOD,
CONSIDERING.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.990
GUESS I AM.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.425
- IT'S NICE FOR A CHANGE.
- MMM.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.161
I MISS THIS SIDE OF YOU.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.831
I GUESS IT'S 'CAUSE THIS
SHITTY WEEK IS FINALLY OVER.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.200
YOU'RE ALSO
SHOWING ME SOMETHING.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.302
WHAT AM I SHOWING YOU?

10:03.536 --> 10:06.840
HOW IT FEELS
TO BE WITH LAURA.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.442
HOW A THERAPIST FEELS

10:09.542 --> 10:12.780
WHEN A PATIENT IS FLIRTING.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.283
YOU THINK I'M
FLIRTING WITH YOU?

10:16.383 --> 10:17.751
WELL, NO.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.753
THAT'S THE WRONG WORD.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.789
IT'S NOT FLIRTING, IT'S--

10:21.889 --> 10:24.892
I'M YOUR COVER BUT--

10:24.992 --> 10:28.495
YOU'RE INVITING ME
TO A PARTY

10:28.595 --> 10:30.530
AND YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHICH DRESS TO WEAR

10:30.630 --> 10:32.499
AND YOU'RE INVITING ME
INTO YOUR LIFE.

10:32.599 --> 10:35.235
AND IT MAYBE IS
A TASTE OF...

10:35.335 --> 10:37.771
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE
WITH LAURA.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.373
YOU KNOW,
SHE DRAWS YOU IN.

10:42.575 --> 10:44.745
IT MUST BE FLATTERING.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.616
YEAH, YEAH IT IS.

10:49.717 --> 10:52.853
I GOTTA TELL YOU, SHE'S
ONE HELL OF A STORYTELLER.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.422
MAN, CAN SHE WEAVE A TALE.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.657
( laughs )

10:59.626 --> 11:02.996
SHE GOES INTO EXPLICIT,
VIVID DETAIL.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.667
SHE SPENT ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR
TELLING ME ABOUT THE, UM--

11:09.669 --> 11:12.005
ABOUT THE SEX THAT
SHE HAD WITH ALEX--

11:12.105 --> 11:15.042
WHAT SHE LIKED,
WHAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE,

11:15.142 --> 11:18.178
WHAT HE LIKED,
WHAT SHE DID,

11:18.278 --> 11:21.381
WHAT HE DID,
ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.684
PRETTY VIVID.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.120
A MAN WOULD HAVE TO
BE MADE OF ROCK

11:27.220 --> 11:30.223
NOT TO REACT,

11:30.323 --> 11:32.459
NOT TO FEEL A LITTLE...

11:32.559 --> 11:33.927
A LITTLE WHAT?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.529
JEALOUS.

11:36.629 --> 11:39.166
YEAH.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.700
OF COURSE, THAT'S
WHAT SHE WANTED.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.236
WAS IT?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.573
I KNOW YOU THINK
IT'S A PROBLEM

11:46.673 --> 11:48.708
THAT I HAVE THIS JEALOUSY

11:48.809 --> 11:50.277
OVER LAURA'S AFFAIR
WITH ALEX.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.379
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.981
JEALOUSY IS NOT
ON YOUR LIST

11:54.081 --> 11:56.216
OF REACTIONS
A THERAPIST SHOULD HAVE.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.551
OR IS IT A LIST
OF NO-NO FEELINGS?

11:58.651 --> 12:00.821
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT
FROM ME, A LIST?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.189
WOULD THAT MAKE IT EASIER?

12:02.289 --> 12:04.191
I DOUBT IT.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.126
YOU KEEP PUTTING
WORDS IN MY MOUTH.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.961
MAYBE YOU WANT ME
TO BE UNREASONABLE

12:08.061 --> 12:10.798
SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO PUSH AGAINST.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.201
THIS TOPIC-- THIS TOPIC
ALWAYS BRINGS US BACK

12:14.301 --> 12:16.937
- ONTO SHAKY GROUND,
DOESN'T IT?
- WHAT TOPIC?

12:17.037 --> 12:19.472
THE BOUNDARIES
BETWEEN THERAPIST
AND PATIENT.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.175
TEACHERS MARRY STUDENTS.
THERE'S NO BIG DEAL ABOUT IT.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.945
WHAT'S THE-- I MEAN,
IS IT REALLY WRONG?

12:25.045 --> 12:28.115
IT'S DIFFERENT, PAUL.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.785
I REMEMBER CHARLIE,

12:31.885 --> 12:34.687
YOUR PATIENT.

12:34.788 --> 12:36.523
HE USED TO CALL ME
AFTER SESSIONS

12:36.623 --> 12:39.659
AND HE'D SAY, "THIS NO-SEX-
WITH-THE-THERAPIST THING,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.194
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.831
IS IT FOR REAL?
THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOOPHOLE.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.066
AM I NEVER GOING TO GET
TO SLEEP WITH GINA?"

12:48.268 --> 12:50.537
OKAY, LET'S STAY
I STOP LAURA'S THERAPY.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.272
LET'S SAY I SEND HER
TO SOMEBODY ELSE

12:52.372 --> 12:53.841
AS YOU WANT ME TO DO.

12:53.941 --> 12:57.210
SURELY, IN SIX MONTHS TIME
I CAN CALL HER UP AND SAY--

12:57.310 --> 12:58.778
NO, NO YOU CAN'T.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.614
THEN A YEAR, 18 MONTHS,
WHEN IT'S COOLED OFF.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.483
NO, PAUL, NO.
THERE'S NO COOLING-OFF PERIOD.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.186
IT'S NOT ABOUT
COOLING OFF.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.388
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THE DYNAMIC.

13:08.488 --> 13:12.025
IN SIX MONTHS OR 10 YEARS,
SHE'LL STILL BE A PATIENT.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.462
BUT THAT'S JUST SOME BULLSHIT
SOME LAWYER CAME UP WITH.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.130
NO, IT'S NOT A LAW.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.899
IT'S BEYOND
A CODE OF ETHICS.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.667
IT'S ESSENTIAL.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.871
IT'S SOMETHING
YOU CARRY INSIDE YOU.

13:23.971 --> 13:27.207
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

13:27.307 --> 13:30.110
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS
THAT THERE IS NO CONCEIVABLE

13:30.210 --> 13:31.711
SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES
IN WHICH--

13:31.811 --> 13:33.246
NONE.

13:33.346 --> 13:35.182
CHRIST, YOU'RE
SO FUCKING FUNDAMENTALIST.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.984
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
A LOT OF PEOPLE

13:37.084 --> 13:38.551
WHO WOULD DISAGREE
WITH THIS.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.587
THEN GO TO THEM.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.131
SHE'S 30 YEARS OLD.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.901
SHE'S SEDUCTIVE,
DEPENDENT, HYSTERICAL.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.937
SHE IDOLIZES YOU.
IT'S CLASSIC, RIGHT?

13:57.037 --> 13:58.972
IT'S TEXTBOOK.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.308
HERE'S A GIRL WITH
DAMAGED SELF-ESTEEM--

14:01.408 --> 14:04.244
EXCUSE ME, HOW DO
YOU KNOW SHE'S DAMAGED?

14:04.344 --> 14:07.915
YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT HER AFFAIR
WITH YOUR OTHER PATIENT,

14:08.015 --> 14:09.749
HER TRYING
TO MAKE YOU JEALOUS,

14:09.849 --> 14:13.153
HER DESCRIBING THE SEX,

14:13.253 --> 14:15.923
HOW SHE'S TRIED
TO ENTER YOUR HOUSE,

14:16.023 --> 14:19.459
HOW SHE'S PLAYED
ALL OF THESE GAMES

14:19.559 --> 14:22.229
TO TRY TO GET AN OEDIPAL
REACTION FROM YOU.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.531
IF YOU FALL
FOR THESE ADVANCES,

14:24.631 --> 14:25.966
SHE WON'T BE GRATEFUL.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.368
SHE'LL BE SHOCKED,
RIGHTLY SO.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.372
AND SHE'LL LEAVE YOU.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.509
ALL OF WHICH YOU KNOW,

14:36.609 --> 14:39.146
BUT YOU'RE IGNORING IT.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.482
YOU WANT TO BE DESIRED.

14:43.951 --> 14:45.552
WE ALL DO.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.958
BUT YOU NEED TO REMEMBER
WHY LAURA CAME TO YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:51.058 --> 14:54.561
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME NOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY PATIENT?

14:54.661 --> 14:57.530
ANOTHER DISSERTATION ON
WHAT A LOUSY THERAPIST I AM?

14:57.630 --> 15:00.300
I HAVE NEVER, EVER
SAID ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.935
- EXCUSE ME, YOU HAVEN'T?
- NEVER.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.836
WHAT ABOUT THAT FAMOUS
LETTER YOU WROTE?

15:03.937 --> 15:05.505
OH, PAUL.

15:05.605 --> 15:09.709
I CARRIED THAT LETTER
IN MY POCKET FOR MONTHS.

15:09.809 --> 15:12.212
BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY THAT
EVERYTHING I'VE ACCOMPLISHED

15:12.312 --> 15:14.214
AS A THERAPIST,
I OWE TO THAT LETTER.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.848
SO, THANK YOU.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.918
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING
AWAY FROM LAURA AGAIN.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.654
I CAN QUOTE IT.
"THE PATIENTS WERE

15:21.754 --> 15:24.357
CONSISTENTLY POSITIVE

15:24.457 --> 15:27.594
ABOUT THEIR SESSIONS
WITH PAUL.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.163
HOWEVER, IT BECAME CLEAR
THAT PAUL WAS PLAYING

15:30.263 --> 15:31.864
TO THEIR EXPECTATIONS.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.766
HIS APPROACH TO THERAPY
IS COMPROMISED--"

15:33.866 --> 15:37.570
NO, ACTUALLY WHAT YOU WROTE
WAS "SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED

15:37.670 --> 15:40.340
BY HIS DESIRE TO PLEASE."

15:40.440 --> 15:44.544
THAT TRANSLATES TO ME AS,
"HE'S A SHITTY THERAPIST."

15:44.644 --> 15:47.447
I ALSO SAID THAT YOU WERE
ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT--

15:47.547 --> 15:49.382
I KNOW WHAT YOU SAID.
YOU SAID ALL KINDS OF THINGS.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.251
YOU SAID THAT
I WAS YOUR FAVORITE,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.020
THAT I WAS THE HEIR APPARENT.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.721
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL ME
THAT I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH?

15:54.821 --> 15:58.058
BECAUSE THAT'S
NOT THE WAY I FELT.
WHY WOULD I SAY THAT?

15:58.158 --> 15:59.492
THEN I COULD'VE
GOTTEN ON WITH MY WORK

15:59.592 --> 16:02.129
INSTEAD OF DRAGGING OUT
EIGHT YEARS OF PROMISES,

16:02.229 --> 16:05.765
OF DRUMROLL
LEADING TO THE WORST
HUMILIATION OF MY LIFE.

16:05.865 --> 16:08.901
YOU KNOW WALKER,
EVEN JEFFRIES,

16:09.002 --> 16:11.271
THEY SAID THAT
I WAS GUARANTEED

16:11.371 --> 16:13.073
TO BE THE HEAD
OF THE INSTITUTE.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.608
ACROSS THE BOARD
EVERYBODY AGREED WITH IT.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.277
EXCEPT YOU.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.046
I DIDN'T BELIEVE
YOU WERE READY.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.413
CLEARLY, YOU DIDN'T.

16:20.513 --> 16:23.483
THE WAY YOU TOOK CRITIQUE,
IT MADE YOU FURIOUS.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.686
YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONE
PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.388
AND YOU TOOK IT PERSONALLY.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.523
SO PERSONALLY,
I HAD TO WONDER

16:30.623 --> 16:33.260
IF IT WASN'T AN ECHO
OF AN EARLIER REJECTION.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.962
OH, PLEASE, GINA.
NOT THIS AGAIN.

16:36.063 --> 16:38.065
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

16:38.165 --> 16:40.367
A SON WHO FEELS HE'S
DISAPPOINTED HIS FATHER;

16:40.467 --> 16:43.002
A SON WHO FEELS
HE HASN'T LIVED UP

16:43.103 --> 16:44.604
TO HIS FATHER'S EXPECTATIONS.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.340
IT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD
WANT TO ADDRESS.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.476
PLEASE DON'T MINIMIZE
WHAT YOU SAID TO ME, GINA.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.279
I WASN'T REACTING
TO SOMETHING IN MY PAST

16:52.379 --> 16:53.913
IN RELATION TO MY FATHER.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.550
ONE REVIEW DROVE YOU
OUT OF THE INSTITUTE.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.688
THAT LETTER PISSED ON
EIGHT YEARS OF MY WORK.

17:05.725 --> 17:09.329
DESPITE IT, THOUGH,
I BECAME AN EXCELLENT THERAPIST.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.232
AND SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT SAY THAT...

17:12.332 --> 17:14.701
I BECAME A BETTER
THERAPIST THAN YOU.

17:16.236 --> 17:17.537
MAYBE YOU FEEL THAT.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.407
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS REALLY ABOUT, GINA.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.378
SO LET ME ASK YOU AGAIN:

17:25.478 --> 17:29.682
WHY DID YOU COME
TO ME SPECIFICALLY?

17:32.352 --> 17:36.055
I SUPPOSE BECAUSE
I NEEDED TO,

17:36.156 --> 17:38.958
I DON'T KNOW, TEST MYSELF.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.627
I MEAN, I ALREADY KNEW
BEFORE I CAME HERE

17:40.727 --> 17:43.630
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA SAY
ABOUT ME AND LAURA AND KATE.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.064
BUT I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

17:45.165 --> 17:47.800
YOU KNOW, IF I CAN
WITHSTAND YOUR...

17:47.900 --> 17:49.269
CORROSIVE ATTACKS,

17:49.369 --> 17:52.805
YOUR PARTICULAR BRAND
OF ANALYTICAL CASTRATION--

17:52.905 --> 17:55.775
THAT SOUNDS HORRIBLE.
WHY PUT YOURSELF
THROUGH THAT?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.779
SO THAT I CAN...

18:03.116 --> 18:05.051
TRUST MYSELF, I SUPPOSE.

18:05.152 --> 18:07.420
TRUST YOURSELF?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.489
WITH WHAT?

18:13.826 --> 18:15.895
YOU KNOW...

18:15.995 --> 18:17.897
YOU SAID THAT YOU WERE
WRITING A NOVEL.

18:17.997 --> 18:19.532
YOU KNOW...

18:19.632 --> 18:21.568
I FOUND THAT KIND OF AMUSING,
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

18:21.668 --> 18:25.305
BECAUSE A NOVEL
IS ABOUT COMPLEXITY.

18:25.405 --> 18:29.008
IT'S ABOUT CONTRADICTIONS,
FOIBLES, HUMAN FOLLY.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.610
NOT ABSOLUTES.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.380
FOR YOU, COMPLEXITY
IS A PROBLEM,

18:33.480 --> 18:36.416
SOME KIND OF PATHOLOGY
THAT NEEDS TO BE TREATED.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.251
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND
FUCKING OFFENSIVE,

18:38.351 --> 18:39.619
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, GINA?

18:39.719 --> 18:41.521
THAT YOU THINK I'M
BLIND TO A SITUATION

18:41.621 --> 18:44.624
AS OBVIOUS AS EROTIC
TRANSFERENCE.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.598
LET ME JUST TELL YOU
THAT I TREAT LAURA

18:51.698 --> 18:54.667
WITH THE SAME INTEGRITY,
THE SAME CONCERN,

18:54.767 --> 18:56.203
THE SAME RIGOR

18:56.303 --> 18:58.571
AS I TREAT ALL MY PATIENTS.

19:00.039 --> 19:02.475
I HAPPEN TO LIKE MY PATIENTS.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.444
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.547
I WORRY ABOUT THEM.
I IDENTIFY WITH THEM.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.217
I PUT MYSELF OUT FOR THEM.
YOU ANALYZE THEM.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.855
I ANALYZE TOO,
BUT I EMPATHIZE.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.695
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THIS.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.736
DO YOU MISS HAVING PATIENTS?

19:30.537 --> 19:32.205
WHY?

19:32.305 --> 19:34.641
I WAS NEVER REALLY
100% CONVINCED,

19:34.741 --> 19:37.877
TO BE HONEST, THAT YOU
ACTUALLY LIKE THIS PROCESS,

19:37.977 --> 19:41.648
THE SITTING DOWN
WITH A PATIENT.

19:42.949 --> 19:45.618
THAT'S BECAUSE
IN YOUR OPINION
I HAVE NO EMPATHY.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.588
AND SO HOW COULD I GET
ANY SATISFACTION FROM IT?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.323
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DON'T
GET SATISFACTION FROM IT

19:50.423 --> 19:53.226
IN THE SAME WAY
THAT A SAIL-MAKER

19:53.326 --> 19:55.228
OR A CHEMIST GETS
WHEN THEY

19:55.328 --> 19:57.564
PRACTICE THEIR CRAFT.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.299
BUT THAT THING THAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT THAT EXISTS

19:59.399 --> 20:01.200
BETWEEN A DOCTOR
AND A PATIENT--

20:01.301 --> 20:03.936
THAT CONNECTION,
THAT BUZZ...

20:06.606 --> 20:11.210
SEE, I CAN'T HELP BUT
CONNECT WITH THE PERSON.

20:11.311 --> 20:14.314
THAT'S WHO I AM
AS A THERAPIST.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.750
THAT'S MY--
THAT'S MY REWARD.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.031
A WHILE AGO, BEFORE--

20:32.131 --> 20:34.667
I STARTED COMING HERE

20:34.767 --> 20:37.003
THERE WAS--

20:37.103 --> 20:39.706
THERE WAS
A SESSION THAT...

20:43.042 --> 20:45.378
LAURA CRIED.

20:46.713 --> 20:50.483
SHE'D NEVER ACTUALLY
DONE THAT BEFORE.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.653
THAT'S A KIND OF
A VICTORY, RIGHT?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.622
IT'S KIND OF A MILESTONE
FOR A THERAPIST

20:55.722 --> 20:57.924
WHEN YOU GET THE PATIENT
TO THAT POINT

20:58.024 --> 21:00.760
WHERE THEY CRY.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.602
IT WAS DIFFERENT WITH HER.
THERE WAS SOMETHING SO--

21:11.404 --> 21:13.306
SO MOVING
ABOUT SEEING HER

21:13.406 --> 21:15.642
JUST BREAK DOWN
LIKE THAT.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.348
IN THAT MOMENT, I SWEAR,

21:21.448 --> 21:24.283
I COULD'VE SAID,
"FUCK IT ALL.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.019
I JUST WANT
TO BE WITH HER."

21:27.119 --> 21:28.988
BUT I DIDN'T.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.323
I CAME TO YOU INSTEAD.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.258
I CAME SPECIALLY TO YOU.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.361
I CHOSE YOU 'CAUSE
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,

21:34.461 --> 21:38.197
"IF GINA CAN'T CONVINCE
ME TO STAY AWAY,

21:38.297 --> 21:40.767
THEN HOW AM I GONNA
CONVINCE MYSELF?"

21:46.906 --> 21:50.209
IT'S REALLY TOUGH WHEN
I'M ALONE WITH HER, YOU KNOW?

21:50.309 --> 21:54.080
AND SHE'S ASKING ME,
"PLEASE, JUST BE HONEST.

21:54.180 --> 21:57.817
PLEASE, TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL."

21:57.917 --> 22:01.187
AND I CAN'T.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.223
I GUESS THE REASON
I'M HERE IS BECAUSE

22:04.323 --> 22:06.225
I REALLY WANT
TO LOOK AT THIS.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.694
I WANT TO EXAMINE IT.

22:07.794 --> 22:10.663
I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY
CLEAR ABOUT THIS.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.634
100% THAT IT'S NOT--

22:18.237 --> 22:20.239
THAT I'M NOT--

22:20.339 --> 22:23.776
THAT YOU'RE NOT WHAT?

22:28.347 --> 22:31.618
PAUL, YOU NEED TO SAY IT.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.920
YOU NEED TO FINISH
THE THOUGHT.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.591
THAT WHAT I WANT...

22:38.691 --> 22:41.761
ISN'T, IN SOME WAY,
IMMORAL...

22:43.496 --> 22:46.599
OR UNETHICAL.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.469
AND THAT IT'S NOT ABUSE,

22:49.569 --> 22:53.105
AN ABUSE OF MY POWER
AS A DOCTOR

22:53.205 --> 22:54.674
WITH A PATIENT.

23:12.391 --> 23:15.628
I'M NOT PUSHING YOU OUT.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.865
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU TELL ME.

23:18.965 --> 23:22.401
AT THE INSTITUTE,

23:22.502 --> 23:24.236
MAYBE THAT WAS
HUBRIS ON MY PART.

23:24.336 --> 23:27.574
I DON'T KNOW,
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.710
BUT I WON'T DO THAT NOW.
I WON'T REJECT YOU.

23:30.810 --> 23:32.945
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M
GONNA LET YOU DO SOMETHING

23:33.045 --> 23:35.347
THAT YOU'LL REGRET
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,

23:35.448 --> 23:38.284
NOT WITHOUT FIGHTING YOU
EVERY STEP.

23:38.384 --> 23:40.352
IF IT'S SAFETY
YOU NEED,

23:40.453 --> 23:42.689
THIS IS IT.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.327
WE'VE ALREADY CROSSED
LINES OF CONDUCT
IN THIS ROOM.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.262
I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE
I WANT YOU TO KNOW

23:50.362 --> 23:52.599
HOW FAR I'M
WILLING TO GO.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.434
WHATEVER YOU TELL ME,

23:55.535 --> 23:59.038
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.941
I WON'T ABANDON YOU.

24:02.041 --> 24:05.011
NO MATTER WHAT,

24:05.111 --> 24:06.779
I'M HERE.

24:12.184 --> 24:14.721
I LOVE HER.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.426
I LOVE LAURA.

24:20.527 --> 24:23.029
EVERY WORD OUT OF HER MOUTH,
EVERY MOVE SHE MAKES,

24:23.129 --> 24:25.164
I JUST...

24:25.264 --> 24:27.099
I LOVE TALKING
TO HER, YOU KNOW?

24:27.199 --> 24:28.668
JUST LISTENING TO HER.

24:32.371 --> 24:35.207
I KNOW IT'S A JOKE, CLICHE--

24:35.307 --> 24:39.078
50-YEAR-OLD MARRIED MAN
IN LOVE WITH A 30-YEAR-OLD.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.280
BUT I WANT
TO BE WITH HER

24:41.380 --> 24:43.349
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT MEANS.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.085
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT COSTS.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.654
I DON'T CARE.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.095
( sighs )

24:59.098 --> 25:01.500
I LOVE HER.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.887
