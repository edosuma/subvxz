WEBVTT

00:05.422 --> 00:07.590
Cat got your tongue?

00:07.716 --> 00:10.593
No. You killed the cat.
Cut off his head.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.887
Need to
take a look at this.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.723
Mom? Mom.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.850
Mom, it's okay.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.729
Just a couple of questions

00:21.855 --> 00:24.732
before I can authorize
extending her disability benefits.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.402
I don't like her. She's fat.

00:29.196 --> 00:31.155
I could lose a little weight.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.123
You all right?

00:40.791 --> 00:44.877
- Actually, before she signs...
- I killed the cat. Lots of blood.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.005
It's okay.

00:48.132 --> 00:52.093
I have a couple of questions
about some of these dates.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.762
- The first diagnosis...
- Schizophrenia.

00:55.139 --> 00:58.307
Dr. Walters, May 11, last year.
The letter's in the medical file.

00:58.434 --> 01:01.394
And April 6, that was
the last day she worked?

01:01.520 --> 01:04.313
But she received
unemployment benefits for that week.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.942
We fixed that. I know we did.
We returned the money.

01:12.614 --> 01:16.617
That's the canceled check. Not
the real one, you know. It's a copy.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.997
- And you're the dependent?
- No. That's my little brother.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.416
I'm 18. Just helping out.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.759
You're all set.
Just need a signature.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.428
Hey. I'm talking to you.

01:35.554 --> 01:38.639
The cat's first.
Now it's your turn, Lucy.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.684
Shut up.
Shut up, shut up.

01:42.895 --> 01:46.105
It's okay. She just...
She just needs a little water, is all.

01:46.523 --> 01:48.399
I'll go get it.

01:52.738 --> 01:56.240
Just hold on, okay? Just...
When she comes back, sign it,

01:56.366 --> 01:59.577
and we're gonna be done.
We need this, okay? Please.

02:02.831 --> 02:06.209
- Okay.
- The voices...

02:06.502 --> 02:08.503
The voices aren't real.

02:15.010 --> 02:15.843
What?

02:26.438 --> 02:28.523
Mom? Mom.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.609
Mom? Mom. Mom.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.602
38-year-old Caucasian woman.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.896
Status, post-respiratory arrest
in the field.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.107
Intubated, oxygenating poorly.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.782
Dr. Gregory House,

03:19.908 --> 03:24.245
please call Dr. Cuddy
at extension 3731.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.207
This is a good hospital?

03:29.585 --> 03:34.255
Depends what you mean by "good".
I like these chairs.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.551
- How is she?
- Stable. Okay.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.761
Your mom had a small
pulmonary embolism,

03:40.888 --> 03:44.015
a blood clot that got stuck
in her lungs, blocked the oxygen.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.393
- But the pain started in her leg.
- Where the clot started, her calf.

03:47.519 --> 03:50.813
It's called a deep vein thrombosis.
Basically, a bigger clot.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.065
It never hurt there before.
I would have noticed.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.525
A piece went up the vein,

03:54.651 --> 03:56.694
and blocked the blood flow
to her lungs.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.447
- No blood flow, no oxygen.
- Okay.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.991
Is your dad here? I have some things
I need to talk to him about.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.619
My dad's running a little late.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.414
He's dead. Just talk to me.
I take care of her.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.041
All right.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.377
Your mom's blood alcohol was 0.12,
10:30 in the morning.

04:13.503 --> 04:16.380
I gave it to her. Two ounces of vodka.
It cools her out.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.425
But that's the first since Monday.
That was three days ago.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.761
I've been real careful.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.725
- She hears voices.
- She's schizophrenic.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.311
That explains the DVT.
The alcohol makes her pass out.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.896
She's immobile for
long periods of time.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.773
That doesn't happen.
She's not an alcoholic.

04:33.899 --> 04:36.067
She only drinks when
you give it to her?

04:36.193 --> 04:38.152
We put her on blood thinners.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.113
It's not the alcohol.
It's gotta be something else.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.700
Of course it's the alcohol.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.453
Hello.

04:48.372 --> 04:51.082
This guy's a professional doctor.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.085
Plays golf and everything, I bet.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.879
He's not gonna tell you your mom's
an alcoholic without proof.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.215
I'm sure he scoped for varices,
checked her esophagus,

04:59.341 --> 05:01.008
ran all kinds of blood tests.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.220
Doctors like this, they don't make
assumptions. They do the work.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.306
I'd be happy to refer you the case,
Dr. House. You seem so interested.

05:07.432 --> 05:10.393
What case? It's over.
You're sending her home.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.269
- How old is she?
- You're a doctor?

05:12.396 --> 05:14.146
Own my own stethoscope.

05:14.272 --> 05:17.817
Did I ask you how old she was?
I forget.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.987
A 38-year-old woman with no previous
symptoms or history

05:21.113 --> 05:23.739
presents with deep vein thrombosis.
How did she get it?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.909
Oral contraceptives, smoking,
diabetes, obesity.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.160
What's the point here?

05:28.286 --> 05:33.040
A DVT is a DVT. Put her on IV Heparin
to prevent future clots.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.626
Fine. You're all sleepy.
You need a clue.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.879
She's 38 years old.

05:39.089 --> 05:42.008
She's 20 years too young
to get a deep vein thrombosis.

05:42.134 --> 05:43.884
I treated
a 12-year-old girl once,

05:44.011 --> 05:45.636
a soccer player.
She got kicked in the leg.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.722
There was no trauma.
None of the risk factors.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.516
- You took a history?
- I have some notes.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.518
They're not mine,
but reliable, I think,

05:52.644 --> 05:54.437
for the purposes of this discussion.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.773
As for the immobility, well,
she's real active right now, of course.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.942
- Paranoia keeps her limber.
- Paranoia?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.028
Oh, yeah.
She's schizophrenic.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.947
And her kid wrote this, so it might be
a little biased.

06:05.073 --> 06:08.451
You know, having to take care
of his nutso mom and all.

06:08.577 --> 06:10.828
You think there's a connection?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.664
Do we include schizophrenia
in the differential for DVT?

06:13.790 --> 06:15.541
- Well...
- The answer is no.

06:15.959 --> 06:19.587
Abnormal dopaminergic pathways
in the brain do not cause blood clots.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.173
Schizophrenia is
not the cause of DVT.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.967
On the other hand, we don't really know
anything about schizophrenia,

06:25.093 --> 06:27.470
- so maybe it is connected.
- Schizophrenia explains one mystery,

06:27.596 --> 06:29.847
why you're so fascinated by a woman
with a bump in her leg.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.807
It's like Picasso
deciding to whitewash a fence.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.143
Thanks. I'm more of
a LeRoy Neiman man.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.354
And it is only about the DVT.
She's 38 years old. She shouldn't...

06:37.481 --> 06:39.273
Solve this one,
and you're on your way to Stockholm.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.402
We don't even know how to treat it.
Come on. Fumigation of the vagina?

06:43.528 --> 06:44.945
I don't think everyone heard you.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.157
Two thousand years ago,
that's how Galen treated schizophrenics.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.785
- The Marcus Welby of ancient Greece.
- Oh. clearly you're not interested.

06:50.911 --> 06:54.455
I'm interested in
how voices in the head could be caused

06:54.581 --> 06:56.749
- by mal-position of the uterus.
- There's a better place for it?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.794
What do we got? We've got lobotomies,
rubber rooms, electric shocks.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.588
- My, that Galen was so primitive.
- Where are you going?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.131
Going to see the patient.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.051
That all-important human connection.
Thought I'd give it a whirl.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.928
You won't talk
to patients because they lie,

07:09.054 --> 07:10.971
but give you a patient
with no concept of reality...

07:11.098 --> 07:14.517
If it wasn't for Socrates,
that raving, untreated schizophrenic,

07:14.643 --> 07:16.977
we wouldn't have the Socratic method,
the best way of teaching everything,

07:17.104 --> 07:19.271
apart from juggling chain saws.

07:19.397 --> 07:21.398
Without Isaac Nexton,
we'd be floating on the ceiling.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.775
Dodging chain saws, no doubt.

07:22.901 --> 07:26.278
And that guitar player
in that English band. He was great.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.281
You think I'm interested
because of the schizophrenia.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.033
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.410
Galen was pretty sure
about the fumigation thing.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.499
Pink Floyd.

07:42.379 --> 07:47.049
- Mom, this is Doctor...
- Gregory House. Nice to meet you.

07:47.175 --> 07:51.011
Would it be all right
if we spoke alone for a while?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.638
Well, you're gonna need me to...

07:52.764 --> 07:55.057
I've got your case notes, Doctor.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.685
There's a cafeteria downstairs.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.937
Get yourself whatever you want,
as long as there's enough

08:00.063 --> 08:03.440
left over for a Reuben sandwich,
dry, no fries, hold the pickles.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.110
Should run you
about 5.80 with tax.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.950
I'll page you when we're done.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.915
No... pickles.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.756
Nice kid.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.927
How much do you really drink?

08:38.560 --> 08:41.270
He's really talking to a patient?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.898
I don't know who I am anymore.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.901
It's a blood clot.
What's so fascinating about that?

08:47.027 --> 08:50.779
He likes crazy people.
He likes the way they think.

08:50.906 --> 08:54.742
They think badly.
That's the definition of crazy.

08:54.868 --> 08:59.038
- Why would he like...
- They're not boring. He likes that.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.254
- And the meds?
- Baseball. I like baseball.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.717
- Very nice.
- Very sad.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.971
My boy and me,
we went to see a game.

09:16.765 --> 09:20.142
Not "Mets". Meds.
Medicine.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.815
You take what he tells you to take.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.280
No one believes me.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.242
I do.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.377
I thought he liked rationality.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.505
- He likes puzzles.
- Patients are puzzles?

09:49.631 --> 09:52.341
- You don't think so?
- I think they're people.

09:52.467 --> 09:57.763
Yeah. Well, he hates them,
and he's fascinated by them.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.768
Tell me you can't
relate to that sentiment.

10:07.691 --> 10:11.068
- You told Luke it never hurt before.
- Just rough.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.028
They didn't hurt.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.698
Didn't?

10:17.325 --> 10:19.493
Don't lie to him, Limpy.

10:19.619 --> 10:23.998
Lively Lucy never lies to Lucas.
Look what I do to him.

10:26.126 --> 10:29.753
Radiation
therapist to Oncology.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.964
Learn anything
from the "human connection"?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.049
Yeah. The Mets suck.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.219
Also, for the last two months,
she hasn't shaved her legs.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.179
Because of the tremors,
she cuts herself.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.473
The tremors aren't new.
She must always cut herself.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.767
Exactly. Something changed
in the last two months.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.811
I'm thinking the amount of blood
when she cut herself.

10:45.937 --> 10:47.896
So let's start
with some blood work.

10:48.023 --> 10:52.234
Collect and send for clotting studies,
PT, PTT, factor five, protein C and S.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.237
- The whole shebang.
- Good luck.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.364
No pickles, and it's cold now.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.492
- That's the way he likes a Reuben.
- Everyone, this is Luke.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.494
Allison Cameron. It's nice
to finally meet you.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.579
Save it. We're busy.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.416
Luke, give us another half hour with
your mom. We need to do some tests.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.172
Nice kid.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.381
Take her off the psych meds.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.300
That way we'll know what's what
on the physical side.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.720
And who knows,
we might get more out of her.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.018
Don't worry. No pickles.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.396
Happy birthday.

11:30.065 --> 11:32.483
Okay. Whose?

11:32.609 --> 11:36.945
I was going through your mail,
and it was on a form. Happy birthday.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.116
Oh.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.714
- No. No blood. Not mine.
- For the test. Dr. House told us...

11:55.840 --> 12:00.219
You're gonna steal it.
Sell it. No. No blood.

12:00.345 --> 12:04.390
No. No blood.
No. No blood.

12:04.516 --> 12:08.644
- Haldol, five milligrams, stat.
- No. No. No.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.814
No. No.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.609
No. No. Oh, no.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.239
No. No.

12:32.168 --> 12:33.460
Well, good news.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.630
The lab says it's not strep,
so we're done.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.299
- Wait a second.
- No, really, not strep.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.592
The boys in the lab, sure,

12:40.718 --> 12:42.553
they're hard drinkers,
but they're pros, you know.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.513
Plus, your kid has none
of the symptoms for strep.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.975
It was quicker running the test
than arguing with you. My point is, go.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.352
I just wanted to ask
your opinion, Doctor.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.895
She's having a birthday party
next week,

12:52.021 --> 12:53.939
and she's upset that I'm getting
a sugarless cake.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.775
- The other kids hate it.
- This is why you're here.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.236
Sugar is the leading cause
of obesity in America.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.739
You want a doctor to scare her
about the dangers of sugar.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.742
She needs to get
her weight under control.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.995
Well, you know...

13:08.121 --> 13:10.497
I feel sorry for
those other kids, Wendy,

13:10.623 --> 13:13.792
who don't have a mom
who knows that sugar causes

13:13.918 --> 13:16.253
heart disease, appendicitis
and athlete's foot.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.797
- That's not fair.
- Oh, yes, it is. No, I get it.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.509
You want her to slim down so she can
wear pretty clothes like yours.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.219
Love the bracelets.

13:24.345 --> 13:28.265
Hey, what about matching outfits?
You could be twins.

13:28.391 --> 13:32.728
She can't be your daughter.
It's impossible. You look way too young.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.607
Happy birthday.
Get the kid a damned ice cream cake.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.278
You drugged her.

13:41.404 --> 13:44.072
Actually, I didn't.
I've taken her off all medication.

13:44.199 --> 13:48.076
- Your guy Foreman gave her Haldol.
- We needed blood for tests.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.786
I assume that was
the only way to get it.

13:49.913 --> 13:50.996
He knocked her out.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.540
Look, I have a cane,
and I know how to use it.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.626
I hired you.
You work for me.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.213
Okay. Can I go now, boss?

14:02.550 --> 14:07.804
The Haldol changes her.
She says it makes her soul numb.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.057
Don't give it to her.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.395
"If there be rags enough,

14:15.522 --> 14:19.149
he will know her name
and be well pleased remembering it."

14:22.153 --> 14:23.779
You okay?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.074
Old days.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.036
"For in the old days,

14:31.162 --> 14:34.581
though she had young men's praise
and old men's blame,

14:34.707 --> 14:37.668
among the poor, both old and young
gave her praise."

14:47.178 --> 14:49.555
Help. Somebody help.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.313
So, when I said no psych meds,

14:58.439 --> 15:00.566
I'm just curious, which word
didn't you understand?

15:00.692 --> 15:04.486
The Haldol had nothing to do
with the bleed. You know that.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.405
I used it purely as
a chemical restraint.

15:06.531 --> 15:10.117
Oh, great. Well, that's good to hear.
So she won't experience any of those

15:10.243 --> 15:13.829
pesky little side effects you get
when your motives aren't pure.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.581
Those side effects are so rare.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.958
What, passing out?
Increased confusion?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.211
Depression? That's not gonna happen.
That's not gonna screw up our diagnosis,

15:21.337 --> 15:23.714
'cause you just used it
to restrain her. I'm so relieved.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.591
She spit in my face.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.593
That must have
been so frightening for you.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.511
What was
I supposed to do, tie her down?

15:29.637 --> 15:33.932
Anything but give her drugs.
That's basically my point.

15:34.058 --> 15:38.687
The clotting studies. Pretty fast.
Did you promise to date the entire lab?

15:38.813 --> 15:42.649
No, I save that for emergencies.
I told them she bled out two units

15:42.775 --> 15:44.067
and if it happened again,
she'd die.

15:44.193 --> 15:47.070
If it had happened at home,
she would have died.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.906
The ER doc,
he was gonna send her home.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.118
It turns out your best judgment
is not good enough.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.828
Here's an idea. Next time, use mine.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.913
I think they're choosing a movie.

15:57.790 --> 16:02.711
- Why did the patient bleed out?
- The clotting studies are normal.

16:02.837 --> 16:06.048
Well, cover your ears if you
don't want me to spoil the ending.

16:06.174 --> 16:10.761
Everything was normal, except for a
prolonged PT time. Which means what?

16:10.887 --> 16:14.014
Usually it means whoever drew the blood
didn't do it right.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.141
Oh, that's right,
'cause you drew the blood.

16:16.267 --> 16:20.145
But you were precise because you knew
the tube was purely for the PT study.

16:20.271 --> 16:21.897
- That's right.
- And I'm right with you.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.232
I trust this result, for two reasons.

16:24.359 --> 16:26.818
A, because you are a good doctor,

16:26.944 --> 16:29.363
and B, because five milligrams
of IV Haldol

16:29.489 --> 16:32.616
makes for a spectacularly
cooperative patient.

16:34.118 --> 16:37.287
The prolonged PT time makes me think
she's got a vitamin K deficiency.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.414
Vitamin K would explain
the bleed, but not the clot.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.375
Without vitamin K,
protein C doesn't work.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.752
Without protein C, she clots.

16:43.878 --> 16:46.296
Clotting and thinning
all at the same time.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.632
What about another drug
interacting with Heparin,

16:48.758 --> 16:53.136
- an antibiotic like ampicillin?
- Clever, but she's not on ampicillin.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.514
Two months ago,
she complained of a sore throat,

16:55.640 --> 16:57.891
- and he got her ampicillin.
- Which she refused to take.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.477
He just said she didn't take
it. Everybody lies

17:00.603 --> 17:02.145
except for schizophrenics
and their children?

17:02.271 --> 17:05.816
It's more likely than malnourishment.
Why not scurvy or the plague?

17:05.942 --> 17:09.319
Gee, I wish my idea
was as cool and with-it as yours.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.279
What is yours, by the way?
Do you have one?

17:11.406 --> 17:16.159
Alcohol. Simple. It causes immobility,
which explains the DVT.

17:16.285 --> 17:17.577
It also causes cirrhosis,

17:17.704 --> 17:21.081
which explains the bleed
and the prolonged PT time.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.334
- Let's ultrasound the liver.
- Three theories.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.754
Check out her place
for ampicillin and diet.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.756
Then ultrasound her liver.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.968
Let's find out who's right
before she bleeds to death.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.285
So House says
the kid is sensitive,

17:58.411 --> 18:00.370
thinks he takes
good care of her.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.247
But if we don't find anything,

18:02.373 --> 18:05.584
why let him know we did it
in the first place? What's the point?

18:05.710 --> 18:11.673
Why not just make old Foreman lift
the key from the kid's backpack?

18:25.688 --> 18:28.190
Looks like Luke sleeps
in the living room.

18:35.656 --> 18:37.741
Nothing in there.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.787
- He lays out her clothes?
- Enough organization, enough lists,

18:41.913 --> 18:44.206
you think you can control
the uncontrollable.

18:44.332 --> 18:49.211
Fix her meds, fix her clothes,
maybe you can even fix her.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.005
Pick that up on your psych rotation?

19:01.766 --> 19:05.685
Trifluoperazine,
Thorazine, Clozaril.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.562
They tried everything.

19:08.105 --> 19:13.318
The ampicillin, never touched it.
There goes Cameron's theory.

19:13.444 --> 19:16.154
Oh, God, I hope it's not
a vitamin K deficiency.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.081
Damn.

19:26.207 --> 19:30.043
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.
House was right.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.049
- That's the only thing she'll eat.
- Yeah.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.802
The problem is, you can't actually
live on this stuff.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.387
I checked it out.
I looked on the box.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.681
All the nutritional values are solid.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.599
There's plenty of protein and calories.

19:44.725 --> 19:48.645
Vitamin A and C, but no K.
That's why your mom got sick.

19:51.065 --> 19:54.359
- So what's the plan, then?
- Load her up with vitamin K.

19:54.485 --> 19:55.694
That's it?

19:55.820 --> 20:00.490
If it all checks out, you can take
her home in a couple of days.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.911
Oh, God, you're upset
about something.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.039
You're gonna open up to me now,
aren't you?

20:08.165 --> 20:10.083
It's all my fault.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.752
Here we go.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.629
Okay, I'm gonna say this once.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.591
You have done a very good job
taking care of your mother.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.926
If this was all she'd eat,
then what else could you do?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.012
Gosh, just being
a kid is a full-time job.

20:22.138 --> 20:26.182
Shut up. I'm 18. I should be able
to take care of my mom.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.145
- I almost killed her.
- Good example.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.563
Just the time it takes

20:31.689 --> 20:35.150
to express those ridiculous,
self-centered teenage ideas.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.444
I don't envy your schedule.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.781
No pickles.

20:41.908 --> 20:46.286
- My mom doesn't like them either.
- Smart woman.

20:47.455 --> 20:50.415
Before she got sick, I didn't like
how bossy she was.

20:51.292 --> 20:55.045
Always telling me what to do,
the right way to do it.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.549
Never thought I'd miss that.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.305
You should get that looked at.

21:05.431 --> 21:08.141
I still don't buy
a vitamin K deficiency.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.645
House was right. That usually
makes you happy. Less work for us.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.855
The kid feeds his mom
a steady diet of booze,

21:13.981 --> 21:16.900
- and the problem is too many burgers?
- The kid's in a tough situation.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.443
You do what you gotta do to survive.

21:18.569 --> 21:22.113
Feeding alcohol to an alcoholic is not
a survival technique.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.617
- Where I come from, if it works...
- Yeah, right. I'm rich.

21:25.743 --> 21:30.038
I couldn't possibly understand
what this kid is going through.

21:30.164 --> 21:31.706
Just because you're
drinking pricier stuff

21:31.832 --> 21:34.292
doesn't mean you don't have a problem.

21:34.418 --> 21:37.003
You've seen someone
stagger down that road?

21:37.129 --> 21:39.673
No way vitamin K
is the whole story.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.265
It's not broken.
See this, right here?

21:49.392 --> 21:53.311
It's the epiphyseal plate,
otherwise known as the growth plate.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.690
- What's wrong with it?
- Amazing thing, this bone.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.443
If you know how to read it, it can
tell you how old someone really is.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.238
- Exactly how old.
- Great.

22:03.990 --> 22:08.159
Not even 15.
Almost, though.

22:08.285 --> 22:10.954
Two weeks away.
Maybe a month.

22:12.415 --> 22:15.750
Last week.
I was 15 last week.

22:15.876 --> 22:18.545
Happy birthday to both of us.

22:18.921 --> 22:21.881
If you're gonna lie, though, go big.
Go 21.

22:22.008 --> 22:25.760
That way you won't need
your crazy mom to help you buy vodka.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.263
Great. Thanks for the tip.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.766
Now, when I bring my mom home,

22:31.892 --> 22:34.519
is there anything I need to know
about taking care of her?

22:34.645 --> 22:37.272
I suppose your biggest worry
isn't the booze.

22:37.398 --> 22:40.191
You're 15,
basically no mom.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.318
If Child Welfare let kids
get away with that,

22:42.445 --> 22:44.154
they wouldn't need
those nice foster homes,

22:44.280 --> 22:48.241
- and that would make them sad.
- They'd put her someplace, too.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.703
- My life is working.
- Not the word I'd use.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.541
Most 15-year-old kids are doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

22:56.667 --> 23:00.962
- They're huffing glue, catching crabs.
- If you turn me in, I'll sue you.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.089
That's privileged information.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.301
Oh, relax. It's not even your X-ray.

23:10.806 --> 23:14.392
- She's awfully calm.
- House wrote new orders.

23:18.105 --> 23:21.441
There's a little bit of scarring.
Not much. Not enough to...

23:21.567 --> 23:25.028
It's cirrhosis.
But she doesn't drink.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.781
Congratulations. You win.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.910
Actually...

23:33.287 --> 23:37.749
- no one wins.
- Tumor. Cystic?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.752
Solid mass.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.587
Cancer.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.676
The vitamin K caused the DVT
and aggravated the liver,

23:48.803 --> 23:51.221
but the tumor's
the real reason for the bleed.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.598
The tumor's the problem.

23:53.724 --> 23:55.975
Mrs. Palmeiro, I'm Dr. Wilson.

23:56.102 --> 24:00.063
I'm afraid I have
some bad news from your ultrasound.

24:00.189 --> 24:01.356
You have cancer.

24:36.016 --> 24:38.476
It's big. 5.8 centimeters.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.437
We do nothing, she dies
from liver failure within 60 days.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.148
- She needs a transplant.
- That's gonna happen.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.566
She's 38 years old. She's a mother.

24:44.692 --> 24:48.069
She's a schizophrenic mother with no
money, on the public dole, in fact,

24:48.195 --> 24:50.613
who knocks back vodka
every time a breeze blows her way.

24:50.739 --> 24:53.867
Mickey Mantle had a whole bar named
after him. He got a transplant.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.871
Yeah, well, Lucy can't switch-hit.
Plan B, surgery to resect the tumor.

24:57.997 --> 24:59.789
Joe Bergin does the gamma knife thing.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.250
Laser cauterizes while it cuts,
saves more liver.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.669
The tumor's way too big.
He won't even consider it.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.296
Not a big risk-taker, Bergin.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.256
Won't even drink milk
on its expiration date.

25:08.382 --> 25:13.303
He has no discretion. 5.8 centimeters
is past the surgical guidelines.

25:15.222 --> 25:17.390
Would he do it at 4.6?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.435
Why don't we just say it's zero?
Then we don't need him at all.

25:20.561 --> 25:22.687
Tumors grow, they don't shrink.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.564
This one does.

25:25.858 --> 25:28.610
Ninety-five percent ethanol.

25:28.986 --> 25:32.071
The ethanol dehydrates
the tumor cells.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.908
Literally sucks them dry.

25:36.202 --> 25:40.455
- It shrinks the tumor temporarily.
- How temporarily?

25:41.373 --> 25:44.125
Well, if we're lucky...

25:46.754 --> 25:49.964
just long enough to fool the surgeon.

25:57.556 --> 26:02.852
Dr. Shopius,
report to Psych Exam.

26:03.395 --> 26:07.273
- Good morning, Dr. House.
- Good morning, Dr. Cuddy.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.983
Love that outfit.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.153
It says, "I'm professional,
but I'm still a woman".

26:12.279 --> 26:14.405
Actually, it sort of
yells the second part.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.575
Yeah, and your big cane
is real subtle, too.

26:17.701 --> 26:21.996
Gotta go. Those running noses aren't
just gonna start walking on their own.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.581
The clinic can wait.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.168
How long? Maybe we could catch a
movie.

26:27.294 --> 26:30.338
You should know by now
my doctors have no secrets from me.

26:31.924 --> 26:35.969
I don't believe it.
Who came running to mommy?

26:36.470 --> 26:40.556
It doesn't matter who. The point is,
I know exactly what you did.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.101
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

26:43.227 --> 26:46.396
Somebody knows
about a bad thing you did.

26:46.522 --> 26:47.814
That's a big field.

26:47.940 --> 26:52.277
But somebody you think might've told me.
That narrows it down quite a bit.

26:52.403 --> 26:54.862
Someone who views me
as a maternal authority figure.

26:54.989 --> 26:58.366
A young person, perhaps? How am I doing?
Think I'm gonna get there?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.368
Presumably hospital business.
How many patients...

27:00.494 --> 27:03.162
It's Cameron. She found out
about my birthday.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.373
I thought she told you and I'd have
to stand here and smile

27:05.499 --> 27:08.376
while you gave me
a sweatshirt or a fruit basket.

27:08.502 --> 27:11.462
You know, made me feel
that deep sense of belonging.

27:11.839 --> 27:15.383
Actually, I was just gonna remind you,
you owe me six clinic hours this week.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.885
Oops.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.394
Hi, this is Dr. Cuddy.

27:26.520 --> 27:30.023
I need all the charts
on Dr. House's current patients.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.779
- I've tried everything.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:36.905 --> 27:41.451
"Pulling the tongue, ice packs
on the throat, hitting yourself,

27:41.577 --> 27:43.870
the groin pinch."

27:44.705 --> 27:48.708
Well, you've certainly covered
all the normal medical bases.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.461
How are you hitting
yourself, though? Is it...

27:51.587 --> 27:54.130
- Is it an open hand or a fist?
- Open hand.

27:54.256 --> 27:59.510
Well, that's how they teach it
at Harvard Med. How hard, though?

28:02.014 --> 28:04.807
I'm sorry. I missed that.
Could you do that again?

28:06.352 --> 28:09.270
That's... That's very good.
It's hiccups.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.272
I need to speak with you now.

28:11.982 --> 28:13.733
I need to go pee-pee.

28:13.859 --> 28:17.111
Dial it up a notch and repeat.
I'll be back.

28:28.499 --> 28:31.751
Girl in the boy's bathroom.
Very dramatic.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.463
It must be very important,
what she has to say to me.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.592
Yesterday your patient's tumor
was 5.8 centimeters.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.803
Today it's 4.6.
How does that happen?

28:41.929 --> 28:45.765
Well, at a guess, I'd say, "That
Dr. House must be really, really good.

28:45.891 --> 28:49.685
Why am I wasting him on hiccups?"
I wash before and after.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.775
You also requisitioned
20 cc's of ethanol.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.569
What patient was that for?
Or are you planning a party?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.530
Do me a favor.

29:03.325 --> 29:06.077
I was gonna say leave,
but that works.

29:06.912 --> 29:08.121
You shrunk the tumor.

29:08.247 --> 29:09.831
Only way to get
the guy to do the surgery.

29:09.957 --> 29:12.542
Fraud was the only way?

29:13.377 --> 29:15.920
There is a reason
that we have these guidelines.

29:16.046 --> 29:19.006
I know. To save lives.
Specifically, doctors' lives.

29:19.133 --> 29:21.926
And not just their lives,
but their lifestyles.

29:22.052 --> 29:23.928
Wouldn't want to operate
on anyone really sick.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.513
They might die and spoil our stats.

29:25.639 --> 29:28.182
Bergin has a right to know
what he is operating on.

29:28.308 --> 29:30.643
True. I got all focused
on her right to live and forgot.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.271
You do what you think is right.

29:42.656 --> 29:46.159
- You really didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.744
And, frankly, I'm angry.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.832
The correct response, I guess.
What are you talking about?

29:52.958 --> 29:55.460
- Your birthday.
- Oh.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.920
Anger was a bad guess.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.923
Well, normally, I'd put on a festive hat

30:01.049 --> 30:04.469
and celebrate the fact that the Earth
has circled the sun one more time.

30:04.595 --> 30:06.554
I really didn't think it was gonna
make it this year,

30:06.680 --> 30:10.558
but darn it if it wasn't the little
planet that could all over again.

30:10.684 --> 30:14.562
It's a birthday.
It's an excuse to be happy.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.023
You think that's lame?

30:18.108 --> 30:21.110
Why are you here?
Did you buy me a pony?

30:22.654 --> 30:25.615
I'm just waiting for the surgery.

30:26.783 --> 30:29.494
Yeah, well, go scrub in.

30:40.339 --> 30:43.090
All right, we're done.
Close her up.

30:48.180 --> 30:52.141
The tumor didn't just
walk itself into a bar

30:52.267 --> 30:56.771
and order up a double shot of ethanol.
Someone shrunk it down.

30:56.897 --> 30:59.524
I'm sorry.
It was very, very wrong.

31:00.150 --> 31:03.110
House is lucky
I didn't just close her up.

31:03.237 --> 31:05.821
He tries it again, that's what happens.

31:05.948 --> 31:07.698
I'll pass it on.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.537
It looks like
the surgeon got it all,

31:12.663 --> 31:15.248
but she's gonna have to have
some chemotherapy.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.958
What kind is it?

31:18.961 --> 31:20.795
Luke, stop writing.

31:28.262 --> 31:31.138
If you stop for a second,
it's not all gonna fall apart.

31:31.265 --> 31:32.723
Give yourself a break once in a while.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.601
The fact is, your mom's gonna have
an extra drink every now and then.

31:35.727 --> 31:40.022
- No. No. She won't. She doesn't.
- Fine.

31:40.983 --> 31:44.527
There are some things
you just can't fix.

31:44.695 --> 31:50.032
That's how you'd handle it,
something like this? You'd just give up?

31:50.158 --> 31:52.118
No.

31:52.786 --> 31:55.204
I'd do it just like you.

31:57.499 --> 31:59.083
It's an infusion.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.294
She's gonna have
a drain in her abdomen.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.297
You're going to have to check
for possible infection.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.173
Lucas Palmeiro?

32:06.300 --> 32:09.635
Trina Wyatt, Child Services,
State of New Jersey.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.846
Can I help you?
This is a private room.

32:11.972 --> 32:14.682
He's only 15 years old, a minor.

32:14.808 --> 32:18.394
He's in a tough living situation.
We're just here to help.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.480
- I don't need your help.
- 15?

32:21.607 --> 32:26.152
Lucas, you're gonna have
to come with us right now.

32:26.278 --> 32:29.697
- Where are you taking him?
- Until the determination is made,

32:29.823 --> 32:31.699
he'll be housed
at Children's Services.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.660
- I don't want to be housed.
- I live with my mom.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.954
Not for the next few days.

32:37.998 --> 32:41.208
Come on. Let's not
make this difficult.

32:42.628 --> 32:43.753
Mom?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.631
Mom?

32:48.508 --> 32:50.343
I love you.

32:52.721 --> 32:56.849
When the Mets lost,
you remember?

32:57.768 --> 32:59.644
Yeah.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.979
I remember.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.440
I love you.

33:23.418 --> 33:26.128
Cuddy didn't say anything about
pushing Bergin to finish the surgery?

33:26.254 --> 33:30.132
Not a word. Some kind of mind game.
She's waiting for me to crack.

33:30.258 --> 33:32.301
Well, either that
or she's just being nice.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.179
- Yeah, right.
- You said you wouldn't call.

33:35.305 --> 33:38.349
You're a real bastard, you know.

33:41.228 --> 33:44.647
Yeah, I get that a lot.

33:48.902 --> 33:51.278
I don't think mom's crazy.

33:56.076 --> 34:00.746
"For in the old days, though she had
young men's praise and old men's blame,

34:00.872 --> 34:06.127
among the poor, both old and young
gave her praise."

34:12.175 --> 34:16.345
You called Social Services.
It was you.

34:16.471 --> 34:19.140
No. No. No.

34:19.266 --> 34:22.226
It's okay, it's okay. I get it.

34:23.854 --> 34:26.564
He'll have an easier time
dealing with the system.

34:26.690 --> 34:30.651
Sure, he won't be with his real mother,
but his real mother's sick.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.279
Someone needs to take care of him.

34:34.531 --> 34:36.949
I'm not gonna live here.

34:37.075 --> 34:42.037
What would his future have been,
taking you to chemo and back on the bus?

34:42.164 --> 34:45.541
And even if the cancer's
in complete remission,

34:45.667 --> 34:48.753
he'll still have
a mother who hears voices.

34:48.879 --> 34:53.632
Talk no more.

34:54.342 --> 34:57.720
"Look what I do to him, Limpy."

34:58.096 --> 34:59.972
You said that.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.434
I checked the phone records.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.104
Only one call from this room.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.107
Smart, because they charge you
two bucks a call.

35:10.233 --> 35:14.278
It was to Social Services,
the State of New Jersey.

35:14.905 --> 35:18.532
You're his mother.
You couldn't do it to him anymore.

35:21.495 --> 35:22.912
Good for you.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.041
Schizophrenics can
make rational decisions.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.751
On the small stuff, yeah.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.420
When to sleep,
what to drink, you know.

35:31.546 --> 35:34.423
"No lemonade, but I'll take
some hemlock if you've got it."

35:34.549 --> 35:35.424
Your man Socrates.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.385
But giving up your son
because it's better for him,

35:38.512 --> 35:41.639
it's so sane, it's so rational.

35:41.765 --> 35:44.266
Self-sacrifice is not
a symptom of schizophrenia.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.353
- It excludes the diagnosis.
- She's not schizophrenic?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.688
Look, she's 36 years old
when she first presents.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.524
It's a little late,
but within the parameters.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.985
The internist sends her to a shrink.
One shrink sends her to the next.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.238
She tells them all she's not crazy.
The drugs don't work.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.156
And why would they
if she's not a head case?

35:59.282 --> 36:02.618
She got clearer when I took her off
the psych meds.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.162
You think I'm crazy.

36:05.288 --> 36:08.874
Well, yeah, but that's not the problem.
Didn't we just leave your office?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.793
I like to walk.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.647
Is that Dr. Jeffrey Walters? Hi.

37:13.773 --> 37:16.483
My name is Greg House.
I'm a doctor...

37:17.444 --> 37:21.196
Oh, is that the time? Yeah. I'm sorry.
My watch must have stopped.

37:21.323 --> 37:24.450
Listen, you treated a patient
about 18 months ago,

37:24.576 --> 37:25.993
a woman named Lucille Palmeiro.

37:26.119 --> 37:29.246
I wondered if you recalled
running any tests...

37:30.123 --> 37:31.957
at all.

37:32.667 --> 37:35.127
Oh. How terribly foolish of me, Doctor.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.337
Is it that late?

37:36.463 --> 37:41.425
Yes, I'm calling from London, you see?
Must have got my times mixed up...

37:47.891 --> 37:51.226
I have a headache. It's my only symptom.
I go to see three doctors.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.646
The neurologist tells me
it's an aneurysm.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.898
The immunologist says
I've got hay fever.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.983
The intensivist can't be bothered.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.736
Sends me to a shrink, who tells me
that I'm punishing myself

38:00.862 --> 38:02.321
'cause I want to sleep with my mommy.

38:02.447 --> 38:03.989
Maybe you're just
not getting enough sleep?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.283
Pick your specialist,
you pick your disease.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.662
If it's not schizophrenia, what else
presents with psych symptoms?

38:09.788 --> 38:11.372
- Porphyria.
- The Madness of King George.

38:11.498 --> 38:15.501
What about that copper thing?
What's it called? It's genetic.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.879
- The body accumulates too much copper.
- Oh...

38:19.005 --> 38:20.714
- Wilson's Disease?
- Yeah.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.968
Very rare. Nice. I like it.

38:24.094 --> 38:27.096
- If any of us did this, you'd fire us.
- Well, that's funny.

38:27.222 --> 38:28.931
I thought I encouraged you
to question.

38:29.057 --> 38:32.726
You're not questioning. You're hoping.
You want it to be Wilson's.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.687
Boom. Give her a couple of drugs,
she's okay.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.272
July 17.
An appointment with a Dr. Karn.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.400
She didn't keep it.
She never kept another appointment

38:39.526 --> 38:42.277
- with a shrink he made after that.
- Karn is not a shrink.

38:42.404 --> 38:44.488
I looked him up.
He's an ophthalmologist.

38:44.614 --> 38:46.198
Now why would she want her eyes
checked?

38:46.324 --> 38:49.034
- Wilson's presents with cataracts.
- Yes, it does.

38:49.160 --> 38:54.373
It also causes slight cirrhosis,
which Dr. Chase attributed to alcohol.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.875
So what are we still doing here?

38:57.002 --> 38:58.585
Lucy.

38:59.879 --> 39:03.757
- I don't think you're crazy.
- Neither do I.

39:03.883 --> 39:07.469
- But I'm crazy.
- Come on. Let me give you a hand.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.722
Come on.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.391
That's it.

39:12.809 --> 39:17.855
Put your hands on the bar here
and your chin in here.

39:17.981 --> 39:19.064
Thank you.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.899
You're gonna see
a bright light, okay?

39:21.026 --> 39:23.819
Your body might be accumulating
too much copper.

39:23.945 --> 39:27.948
If it is, this should help us see
something called Keyeser-Fleischer rings.

39:29.242 --> 39:32.036
Copper-colored
circles around your corneas.

39:32.162 --> 39:33.620
Wow.

39:34.539 --> 39:38.042
I guess we should start treating her
for Wilson's.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.461
That's what I'd do.

39:51.306 --> 39:55.184
"I will talk no more of books
for the long war,

39:55.310 --> 39:58.103
but walk by the dry thorn
until I have found

39:58.229 --> 40:00.814
some beggar
sheltering from the wind,

40:00.940 --> 40:05.069
and there manage the talk
until her name come round.

40:05.445 --> 40:08.322
If there be rags enough,
he will know her name

40:08.448 --> 40:11.158
and be well pleased
remembering it.

40:12.118 --> 40:16.747
For in the old days, though she had
young men's praise and old men's blame,

40:17.207 --> 40:21.835
among the poor,
both old and young gave her praise."

40:31.262 --> 40:33.764
Hi, Mrs. Palmeiro.
Ready to go home?

40:34.390 --> 40:36.100
Almost.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.393
Mom?

40:49.572 --> 40:52.699
- How are you?
- I'm good.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.752
Oh, you really need a haircut.

41:29.904 --> 41:31.321
Dr. House.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.825
Luke, we're making Dr. House wait.

41:34.951 --> 41:37.494
That's okay. We're just here
for the music.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.788
Luke, come on.

41:49.883 --> 41:53.177
- I'm being discharged.
- I heard a rumor.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.805
Thank God I had cancer, huh?

41:58.433 --> 42:01.685
It's terrible having everybody
think you're nuts.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.312
Really?

42:04.564 --> 42:06.607
I called to thank you.
Did you get my message?

42:06.733 --> 42:08.483
Yes.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.446
You're welcome.

42:14.866 --> 42:18.911
I'm never thanking you.
You turned me in.

42:19.037 --> 42:22.873
I told you we were doing okay.
It was none of your business.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.751
Look, I don't care
how you were living.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.253
I just wanted you out of my life.

42:30.340 --> 42:33.634
That's why I had Dr. Cuddy
call Social Services.

42:49.776 --> 42:51.652
You okay?

42:51.819 --> 42:56.365
You were right. It wasn't the DVT.
It was the schizophrenia.

42:56.491 --> 43:00.786
I know. She's not nearly
as interesting anymore.

43:01.788 --> 43:05.791
Isn't it
your birthday around now?
