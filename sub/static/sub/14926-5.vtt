WEBVTT

00:04.572 --> 00:05.773
RRRRR, RRRRR.
CH-CH-CH!

00:05.806 --> 00:07.775
I'M KILLING
ALL YOUR GUYS!

00:07.808 --> 00:08.442
NO WAY!

00:08.476 --> 00:09.443
TAKE MY
ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE!

00:09.477 --> 00:14.115
LOOK OUT,
HERE COMES A RAPTOR!
3:00! 3:00! AAH!

00:14.148 --> 00:15.149
WHOO!

00:15.183 --> 00:19.720
DAD, THERE WEREN'T
ANY DINOSAURS
IN WORLD WAR II.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.189
OH, BUT THERE
WERE ROBOTS?

00:21.222 --> 00:25.259
THOSE AREN'T ROBOTS.
THOSE ARE CANADIANS.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.429
AND THIS SALT SHAKER
IS EISENHOWER.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.497
OK, OK. GREAT.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.565
UH, I'M ORDERING
FROM BAMBOO PAGODA.
WHO WANTS IN?

00:31.599 --> 00:32.866
NONE FOR ME.
I'M GOING HOME
IN A MINUTE.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.735
NO, YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE
GOING TO WAIT HERE
TILL THE FOOD GETS HERE,

00:34.768 --> 00:37.238
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO
EAT IT AND NOT PAY,
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO.

00:37.271 --> 00:40.141
WELL, IF IT'S
JUST SITTING THERE...

00:40.174 --> 00:40.874
MAKE YOUR FATHER HAPPY.

00:40.908 --> 00:42.476
DON'T ORDER
FROM BAMBOO PAGODA.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.078
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH BAMBOO PAGODA?

00:44.112 --> 00:45.813
WELL, IT'S FINE,
IF YOU LIKE FILTH.

00:45.846 --> 00:49.317
SO HAPPENS
I LOVE FILTH, DAD.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.319
HEY, GUYS!

00:51.352 --> 00:52.386
HEY, BABY!

00:52.420 --> 00:54.088
WAIT, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING
TO BE AT YOUR MOM'S

00:54.122 --> 00:55.123
FOR 2 MORE DAYS.

00:55.156 --> 00:58.626
WOULD YOU WANT
TO BE AT MY MOM'S
FOR 2 MORE DAYS?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.862
I MISSED YOU GUYS.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.431
MMMMM!

01:03.464 --> 01:05.599
UH, WHAT ARE
YOU CHECKING FOR?

01:05.633 --> 01:08.202
FINGERS, TOES.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.138
TATTOOS.

01:10.171 --> 01:10.904
WHAT

01:10.938 --> 01:12.306
OH, LAST TIME
I WENT OUT OF TOWN,

01:12.340 --> 01:15.843
UNCLE EDDIE
PUT NAKED LADIES
ON THEIR NECKS.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.312
HEY, THEY
PICKED THEM.

01:18.346 --> 01:19.247
BABY, BABY.

01:19.280 --> 01:20.881
COME ON, COME ON.
WE'RE FINE,
WE'RE FINE.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.117
HEY, WE HAD
A GOOD TIME,
DIDN'T WE, HENRY?

01:23.151 --> 01:26.187
DAD LET US STAY UP
TILL MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT.

01:26.220 --> 01:28.156
HENRY,
WHAT WAS OUR DEAL?

01:28.189 --> 01:29.857
YOU'D LET US
STAY UP TILL MIDNIGHT

01:29.890 --> 01:31.592
IF WE DIDN'T TELL MOM.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.127
RIGHT.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.763
SHE DRAGGED IT
OUT OF ME.

01:37.265 --> 01:37.831
Claudia: LILY!

01:37.865 --> 01:38.532
OH, UH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:38.566 --> 01:39.833
THERE WAS
A SMALL THING THAT--

01:39.867 --> 01:43.137
UM, JUST ORDER ME
MU SHU PORK.

01:43.171 --> 01:43.737
RIGHT.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.441
ONE FILTHY
MU SHU PORK.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.213
SEAN, WHY IS
ALL THIS JUNK HERE?

01:52.246 --> 01:55.583
OH, I BARRICADED
LILY IN HER ROOM.

01:55.616 --> 01:56.750
YEAH, WHY?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.152
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING

01:58.186 --> 01:59.753
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO BE THE BAD COP?

01:59.787 --> 02:01.255
WRONG! WRONG!

02:01.289 --> 02:03.891
OK, WHAT HAPPENED?
IS SHE OK?

02:03.924 --> 02:05.459
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
SHE'S FINE.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.562
SHE'S JUST
BEING PUNISHED!

02:08.596 --> 02:10.364
WHAT COULD
A TEENAGE GIRL
POSSIBLY DO

02:10.398 --> 02:11.565
TO JUSTIFY THROWING
HER IN SOLITARY?

02:11.599 --> 02:15.636
OH, BELIEVE ME,
SHE'S GETTING OFF EASY
AFTER WHAT SHE DID.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.405
TELL ME
WHAT SHE DID.

02:17.438 --> 02:18.239
SHE WENT--

02:18.272 --> 02:20.608
OK. YOU'VE GOT TO HEAR
HOW IT STARTED.

02:20.641 --> 02:24.212
ALL RIGHT.
I WAS COMING BACK
FROM THE STORE...

02:28.649 --> 02:29.583
HI, DAD.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.451
HEY, LIL.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.752
WHOA. LOOK AT YOU.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.787
I'M NOT DRESSED UP.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.223
NO, I MEAN, YOU J--
I JUST MEANT

02:35.256 --> 02:36.257
YOU LOOK GREAT,
THAT'S ALL.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.860
LOOK, CHRISTINA'S MOM
IS TAKING US
OUT TO DINNER,

02:39.893 --> 02:41.795
SO I GOT
A LITTLE DRESSED UP!

02:41.829 --> 02:42.763
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT!

02:42.796 --> 02:45.533
I MEAN, IF YOU
WANT ME TO CHANGE,
I'LL CHANGE,

02:45.566 --> 02:46.934
BUT I'M JUST
GOING OUT TO DINNER.

02:46.967 --> 02:50.704
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE
MAKING SUCH A HUGE DEAL
OUT OF THIS!

02:50.738 --> 02:51.839
WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.208
I JUST SAID YOU LOOK
GREAT. GO TO DINNER.
I DON'T CARE.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.843
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.412
OH, OK. COOL.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.513
DAD?

02:59.547 --> 03:00.581
MM

03:00.614 --> 03:02.750
I LOVE YOU.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.720
"I LOVE YOU, DAD,"
AND A KISS,

03:06.754 --> 03:09.390
AND YOU WEREN'T
THE LEAST BIT
SUSPICIOUS?!

03:09.423 --> 03:11.225
WELL, I MAY
HAVE BEEN BLINDED

03:11.259 --> 03:13.527
BY MOCK AFFECTION!

03:14.795 --> 03:17.331
LIL! LILY!

03:17.365 --> 03:18.866
ARE YOU OK?!

03:19.600 --> 03:22.236
SEE? SHE'S FINE!

03:39.520 --> 03:40.454
OH.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.955
WAIT A MINUTE,
HONEY. THESE
ARE ON BACKWARDS.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.858
THE HOLE GOES IN FRONT
SO YOU CAN PEE.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.896
NOT ANYMORE.
I'VE GOT A NEW WAY.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.465
OK.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.666
YOU WANT TO SEE?

03:52.700 --> 03:53.267
NO.

03:53.301 --> 03:55.903
AH, I'D LIKE
TO SEE THAT.

03:55.936 --> 03:59.440
I BET HE'S GOT
SOME KIND OF STRAW
DOWN THERE.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.275
OK. YOU TWO,
UP TO BED.

04:01.309 --> 04:02.876
WHOA, WHOA. GIVE
YOUR DAD SOME LOVIN'.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.779
I LOVE YOU GUYS.
COME ON. GOOD NIGHT.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.848
GOOD NIGHT.
BRUSH YOUR TEETH.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.983
CAN WE BRUSH
EACH OTHER'S?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.585
WHATEVER
GETS THE JOB DONE.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.322
THERE'S NO WAY
YOU'RE BRUSHING
MY TEETH.

04:14.355 --> 04:14.988
MOM SAID I COULD.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.089
YOU'RE NOT
BRUSHING MY TEETH.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.493
COME ON, JIMMY.
I'M NOT GONNA
HURT YOU OR ANYTHING.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.629
Jimmy:
DISGUSTING!

04:21.662 --> 04:22.330
GOOD NIGHT!

04:22.363 --> 04:25.866
HEY! DON'T LET
YOUR SISTER OUT!

04:25.899 --> 04:26.967
OK. WHAT HAPPENED?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.403
NOTHING, REALLY.
I WAS JUST IN
THE BACKYARD EARLIER,

04:29.437 --> 04:32.039
JUST SPENDING
SOME QUALITY TIME
WITH THE BOYS.

04:32.072 --> 04:35.275
FIRE! HEH HEH!

04:36.410 --> 04:37.878
AHA! DO IT AGAIN.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.014
FIRE!

04:43.551 --> 04:45.018
HELLO?

04:46.887 --> 04:47.855
SECURITY?

04:47.888 --> 04:49.990
SECURITY? WAIT.
WHAT SECURITY?

04:50.023 --> 04:52.993
OK, REMEMBER
THAT STORY LILY TOLD
ME ABOUT DINNER?

04:53.026 --> 04:55.062
IT WAS A LIE.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.531
YEAH,
SHE REALLY WENT OUT
TO ACTION MOUNTAIN.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.333
ACTION MOUNTAIN,
NEW JERSEY?

04:59.367 --> 05:04.405
THAT'S RIGHT, AND I
HAD TO GO BAIL HER BUTT
OUT OF ACTION JAIL.

05:04.838 --> 05:08.342
HOW DO 2 14-YEAR-OLD
GIRLS EVEN GET
FROM STATEN ISLAND

05:08.376 --> 05:09.477
TO THE MIDDLE
OF NEW JERSEY?

05:09.510 --> 05:10.544
WELL, IF THEIR FATHERS
HAVE ACHIEVED

05:10.578 --> 05:15.883
A BASIC LEVEL
OF COMPETENCE,
THEY DON'T GET THERE.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.818
DAD, I DON'T
NEED YOUR HELP.

05:17.851 --> 05:18.886
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

05:18.919 --> 05:19.720
JUST LET IT PLAY OUT.

05:19.753 --> 05:23.056
AT SOME POINT,
THE STATE'LL INTERVENE.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.960
SO, WHAT, SO YOU
DROVE OUT THERE
AND PICKED HER UP?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.061
NOT THAT EASY.
REMEMBER, YOU GOT OUR CAR.

05:28.095 --> 05:31.399
EDDIE'S GOT A CAR,
BUT HE WON'T LET ME
DRIVE HIS CAR.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.800
OF COURSE HE WON'T.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.067
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE CAR.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.636
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO WRECK IT.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.037
OH, HO HO HO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.972
SEE, I DON'T
WRECK CARS, ALL RIGHT?

05:39.006 --> 05:40.140
YOU WRECK CARS.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.842
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.110
UH, YOU WRECKED YOUR CAR.

05:43.143 --> 05:46.046
BUT EDDIE
DIDN'T WRECK HIS CAR.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.648
SOME IDIOT
RAMMED INTO HIM.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.517
HA HA. RAMMED--
RAMMED INTO HIM?

05:49.550 --> 05:50.618
YOU DIDN'T HEAR
THIS ONE, DAD?

05:50.651 --> 05:52.953
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.989
HE WAS ADMIRING
HIS NEW MUSTACHE.

05:58.926 --> 05:59.993
COMIN' IN NICE.

06:00.027 --> 06:03.897
NICE. IT'S
GONNA REALLY LOOK NICE.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.038
SON OF A BITCH!

06:13.106 --> 06:15.943
I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU GOT A NEW CAR
OUT OF THAT.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.712
IT WAS HIS REWARD
FOR STUPID DRIVING.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.113
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

06:20.147 --> 06:23.083
THE GUY HAD
A LOT OF INSURANCE.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.686
WHY DIDN'T YOU KEEP
THAT MUSTACHE?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.988
I STILL HAVE IT.

06:28.021 --> 06:31.859
THIS IS WHO
I HAVE TO TURN TO
IN MY HOUR OF NEED.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.495
COME ON.
COME ON. LET ME
DRIVE YOUR CAR.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.796
IT'S A SPORTS
UTILITY VEHICLE.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.197
IT'S NOT
LIKE A REGULAR CAR.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.932
IT REQUIRES
SPECIAL SKILLS.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.968
WAIT. HEY,
I GOT AN IDEA.

06:41.001 --> 06:43.537
LET ME DRIVE YOUR CAR.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.705
HEY...NO.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.541
LOOK! EVER SINCE YOU
WERE BORN, I LET YOU
BORROW MY STUFF!

06:47.575 --> 06:49.009
YEAH, AND I
ALWAYS BROKE IT.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.211
AW, GEE.
GIVE ME THE KEYS!
GIVE ME THE KEYS!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.145
NOW YOU'RE ANGRY.

06:52.179 --> 06:53.313
I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU
DRIVE MY CAR ANGRY.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.984
LOOK, I GOT TO GO.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO WATCH
JIMMY AND HENRY.

06:57.017 --> 06:57.951
CALL DAD.

06:57.985 --> 07:01.154
OH, NO, COME ON NOW, ED.
ED, COME ON NOW, LOOK.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.222
I'M BEGGING.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.057
COME ON.
PLEASE? COME ON.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.527
LET ME DRIVE YOUR CAR.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.998
NO.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.700
ARRGGHH!

07:20.107 --> 07:22.810
THE PROBLEM IS
YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH

07:22.843 --> 07:25.145
TO HANDLE
HAVING A TEENAGER.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.615
YOU LACK THE MATURITY.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.216
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

07:29.249 --> 07:32.052
I SAID YOU LACK
THE NECESSARY MATURITY.

07:32.085 --> 07:32.986
YEAH, I HEARD, DAD.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.154
BUT THEN THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE 18

07:34.187 --> 07:36.957
AND DON'T KNOW
WHAT A RUBBER IS.

07:36.990 --> 07:37.958
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:37.991 --> 07:38.926
WHAT'S A RUBBER?

07:38.959 --> 07:40.894
NEVER YOU MIND.
COME ON.
WE'RE MISSING GOLF.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.063
CAN WE WATCH
SCOOBY DOO?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.131
NO.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.933
WHAT'S A RUBBER?

07:45.966 --> 07:48.168
SHUT IT.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.871
WHAT'S A RUBBER?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.073
I DON'T KNOW.

07:59.747 --> 08:03.216
THIS IS MY LANE,
LITTLE CAR.

08:03.884 --> 08:05.919
SO WE GET THERE,
AND THEY TAKE US BACK

08:05.953 --> 08:07.555
TO THIS CREEPY
EMPLOYEES-ONLY AREA

08:07.588 --> 08:09.990
WHERE I GET TO SEE MY
CHILDHOOD HERO
DIZZY THE HIPPO

08:10.023 --> 08:11.759
TAKING A LEAK.
AND HEY, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

08:11.792 --> 08:16.229
THERE'S LILY, CHRISTINA,
AND A FEW SURPRISE GUESTS.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.233
BOYS.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.636
DAD!

08:23.103 --> 08:24.137
HEY.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.774
HOW'S IT GOING?

08:26.807 --> 08:28.676
GOOD. YOU?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.210
OK.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.213
YEAH, UH, HEY, GOSH,
WHO ARE YOUR BUDDIES HERE?

08:33.246 --> 08:36.216
OH, THAT'S BRIAN,
NICK, AND ADAM.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.086
UH-HUH. AND YOU GUYS
ALL GOT HERE,

08:39.119 --> 08:40.320
UH...HOW?

08:40.353 --> 08:41.421
ADAM HAS A CAR,

08:41.454 --> 08:44.024
WHICH MEANS
CHRISTINA'S MOM
DIDN'T HAVE TO DRIVE US.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.559
ISN'T THAT GREAT?

08:45.593 --> 08:46.293
THAT'S GREAT.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.028
AND DO YOU KNOW
YOUR DRIVER ADAM

08:48.061 --> 08:51.899
IS THAT PASSED-OUT DRUNK
WITH HIS FACE
IN THE GARBAGE?

08:51.932 --> 08:58.171
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
OUR ORIGINAL PLAN
WASN'T A GOOD ONE.

09:00.974 --> 09:05.946
OH, MAN! I AM SO GLAD
I WAS OUT OF TOWN
FOR THIS ONE.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.014
OH, YEAH.
GO AHEAD AND LAUGH.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.181
NEXT TIME YOU'RE
TAKING HER WITH YOU.

09:08.215 --> 09:13.220
YOU--YOU COULDN'T EVEN
KEEP HER IN THE STATE.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.156
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LAST BEER?

09:16.189 --> 09:17.991
I'M DRINKING IT.

09:18.025 --> 09:21.128
THAT'S WHY I HID IT
IN THE BACK.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
SO WHAT WAS
HER BIG CRIME ANYWAY?

09:24.097 --> 09:26.199
WELL, IT ALL STARTED
WHEN ONE OF LILY'S
NEW FRIENDS

09:26.233 --> 09:29.770
DECIDED TO STAND UP
ON THE MAGIC JOURNEY
RIDE.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.108
WHOO!

09:35.142 --> 09:36.109
AAH!

09:36.143 --> 09:36.844
AAH!

09:36.877 --> 09:37.845
KING OF THE JUNGLE!

09:37.878 --> 09:40.814
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY.
THAT GUY'S LOOKING
AT YOU.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.619
AAH!
DON DIEGO!

09:45.653 --> 09:47.921
Man: STAY THERE!

09:48.288 --> 09:49.623
HA HA HA.

09:49.657 --> 09:51.659
DUDE,
I DIDN'T DO IT.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.993
WHY ARE YOU
TOUCHING ME?

09:53.026 --> 09:54.628
DUDE, YOU THROUGH?

09:54.662 --> 09:57.297
AAH. OW!

10:02.936 --> 10:04.271
OH, SHAMPOO BOTTLES.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.173
YES, THAT
IS A GOOD PLAN.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.942
ANY GUARD WHO'D NOTICED
WOULD JUST ASSUME

10:08.976 --> 10:12.179
THEY'D COME TO THE PARK
TO WASH THEIR HAIR.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.214
Eddie: YEAH,
BUT THEY'RE GREAT

10:14.247 --> 10:18.285
FOR CASUALLY
SQUIRTING A SHOT
INTO YOUR SODA.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.355
JUST SOMETHING
I KNOW.

10:22.389 --> 10:25.158
HEY, HEY. HOW MUCH
YOU GUYS HAVE TO DRINK?

10:25.192 --> 10:26.226
NOT--NOT THAT MUCH.

10:26.259 --> 10:30.263
UM, IT'S JUST
ADAM FORGOT TO
RINSE OUT THE SHAMPOO.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.735
ACCHH! IT STINKS
LIKE PRELL IN HERE.

10:41.709 --> 10:42.409
SO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS?

10:42.442 --> 10:44.044
NO.
NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.012
THE PROBLEM IS

10:45.045 --> 10:47.114
PARENTS TODAY,
THEY OVERANALYZE.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.149
I NEVER HAD ANY SUCH
PROBLEMS WITH THESE BOYS.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.018
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.686
YEAH?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.054
WHAT WAS
YOUR BIG SECRET?

10:54.087 --> 10:55.088
WELL, THE SECRET IS

10:55.122 --> 10:56.757
YOU DON'T TRY
TO REASON WITH THEM.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.292
THEY DON'T
HAVE THE FACULTIES.

10:59.326 --> 11:03.997
YOU HAVE TO MAKE
THINGS SIMPLE.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.000
NOW, YOU SEE
THIS PICTURE OF THE JUDGE?

11:07.034 --> 11:12.105
IF EITHER ONE OF YOU
OPENS THIS DOOR
AFTER I GO DOWNSTAIRS,

11:12.139 --> 11:12.973
A BULLET

11:13.006 --> 11:16.877
WILL SHOOT OUT OF HIS EYE
AND KILL YOU.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.881
I AM ABSOLUTELY SERIOUS.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.183
GOOD NIGHT.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.222
Walt: SEE, THAT'S
WHAT WE CALL DISCIPLINE.

11:29.256 --> 11:33.761
AND I DIDN'T GET THAT OUT
OF ANY NAMBY-PAMBY BOOK.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.329
YEAH. DIDN'T
THINK YOU DID.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.133
HEY, WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THAT PAINTING?

11:40.167 --> 11:43.270
I KILLED IT
WITH A RAKE.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.808
SO--SO THEN YOU
CAME BACK AND YOU DID
THE BARRICADE THING?

11:47.841 --> 11:48.876
OH, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

11:48.909 --> 11:52.980
SO MUCH MORE
HAPPENED ON THE WAY
TO THE BARRICADE.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.019
JUST WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TAKING THESE KIDS?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.321
OUT OF HERE.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.026
DO I KNOW YOU?

12:06.827 --> 12:08.295
HE STILL WORKS THERE?

12:08.328 --> 12:09.396
OH, YEAH.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.499
AND THEY MADE HIM,
LIKE, THE COMMANDER
OR SOMETHING.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.401
HAIR PLUGS IS A PERSON?

12:14.434 --> 12:17.805
WELL, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.173
GOD, THAT WAS, LIKE,
WHAT, 5 YEARS AGO?

12:20.207 --> 12:22.943
YEAH, THE BEER GARDEN
WAS STILL OPEN
BACK THEN.

12:22.976 --> 12:26.479
OPEN AND A-FLOWIN'.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.529
HA HA HA!

12:42.562 --> 12:44.331
SON OF A BITCH.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.834
Sean:
HEY! HEY, GOOD, MAN.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.068
THIS CAR'S MESSED UP.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.436
YOU GAVE ME A BAD CAR.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.537
HA HA HA HA HA.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.572
AS I RECALL,

12:52.605 --> 12:55.976
YOU TWO WERE BANNED
FROM THE PARK FOR LIFE.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.978
Sean: LET GO, DUDE!

12:58.011 --> 13:00.013
I'M SPILLIN'
MY BEER, MAN.

13:00.047 --> 13:00.948
I GOT IT!

13:00.981 --> 13:02.249
GET YOUR HAND
OFF ME, MAN!

13:02.282 --> 13:05.418
I'M ALL RIGHT!
I'M ALL RIGHT.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.419
OHH!

13:06.453 --> 13:09.122
YEAH, HEY,
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO COME HERE, OK?

13:09.156 --> 13:11.224
I JUST CAME
TO GET MY DAUGHTER
AND HER FRIENDS,

13:11.258 --> 13:13.193
AND--AND
WE'RE GOING HOME.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.161
DAUGHTER.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.229
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.097
EXCUSE ME?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.899
A BIT
ON THE YOUNG SIDE?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.268
NICE TRY, BIG BROTHER.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.537
OH, NO, NO, NO.
HEY, I'M NOT
HER BROTHER.

13:24.571 --> 13:29.242
YEAH. YOU LOOK
MORE LIKE HER DEALER.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.143
OH! OH, I SEE.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.913
OH, OK.
OH, I GET IT.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.347
SO I'M NOT A DAD?

13:34.381 --> 13:35.215
NO.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.349
OH! OK,
NOW I GET IT.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.351
BECAUSE I JUST SPENT
AN HOUR AND A HALF
ON THE TURNPIKE

13:38.385 --> 13:39.853
COMING DOWN HERE
TO GET THEM

13:39.887 --> 13:41.188
JUST FOR THE FUN
OF IT, RIGHT?

13:41.221 --> 13:43.156
YOU KNOW, JUST
FOR THE SHEER JOY

13:43.190 --> 13:45.025
OF DRIVING
5 TEENAGERS
REEKING OF PUKE

13:45.058 --> 13:47.094
ALL THE WAY
BACK HOME, RIGHT?

13:47.127 --> 13:48.195
HA HA! NO, NO.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.229
YOU KNOW WHY?

13:49.262 --> 13:50.931
BECAUSE ONLY A DAD
WOULD GET THAT
SCREWED, RIGHT?

13:50.964 --> 13:52.232
'CAUSE ONLY A DAD
WORKS ALL WEEK

13:52.265 --> 13:53.533
AT HIS
MIND-NUMBING JOB

13:53.566 --> 13:55.869
ONLY TO SPEND
HIS PRECIOUS
SATURDAY NIGHT

13:55.903 --> 13:56.904
AT A FIFTH-RATE
THEME PARK

13:56.937 --> 13:58.305
GETTING
THE THIRD DEGREE
FROM A COP

13:58.338 --> 14:00.207
WITH A DUCK
ON HIS BADGE!

14:00.240 --> 14:01.174
SIR!

14:01.208 --> 14:02.943
THE DUCK ON MY CHEST

14:02.976 --> 14:06.046
STANDS FOR THIS
THEME PARK'S COMMITMENT--

14:06.079 --> 14:07.981
HOW CAN YOU EVEN CALL
THIS A THEME PARK, MAN?

14:08.015 --> 14:09.016
I DON'T GET IT,
YOU KNOW,

14:09.049 --> 14:11.284
BECAUSE OVER HERE,
RIGHT, YOU GOT
THE JUNGLE PART.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.319
ALL RIGHT,
BUT THEN OVER HERE,

14:12.352 --> 14:14.087
YOU GOT
THIS WHOLE OTHER PART

14:14.121 --> 14:15.989
WITH A RAT
ON A SKATEBOARD.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.224
AND THEN
YOU TURN THE CORNER,

14:17.257 --> 14:18.458
AND THEN IT'S,
WHOA, SPACE PORT 2000!

14:18.491 --> 14:22.295
YOU KNOW, THE YEAR
2000, WE'RE ALL GONNA
BE LIVING IN SPACE!

14:22.329 --> 14:24.197
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

14:24.231 --> 14:25.065
WE'RE NOT!

14:25.098 --> 14:26.566
SO WHAT'S THE THEME,
MAN?

14:26.599 --> 14:28.001
WHAT IS THE THEME?!

14:28.035 --> 14:29.236
EASE UP, MAN.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.270
NO, YOU EASE UP!

14:30.303 --> 14:33.506
I WANT YOU
TO TELL ME RIGHT NOW
WHAT THE THEME IS!

14:33.540 --> 14:35.208
CAN'T YOU
MAKE HIM STOP?

14:35.242 --> 14:37.444
HEY, HE'S
A FREAK.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.181
"WHAT IS THE THEME, MAN?"

14:41.214 --> 14:42.615
"TELL ME
THE THEME, MAN.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.117
TELL ME THE THEME!"

14:44.151 --> 14:45.919
LILY, YOUR DAD
IS HILARIOUS!

14:45.953 --> 14:47.087
YOU HEAR THAT?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.289
DRUNKEN TEENAGERS?
NOT THE TOUGHEST
AUDIENCE IN THE WORLD.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.424
WHATEVER.
AM I RIGHT THAT
PLACES LIKE THIS

14:51.458 --> 14:53.060
ARE FREAKIN' TAME?

14:53.093 --> 14:53.826
THERE'S NO THEME!

14:53.860 --> 14:54.928
YOU CALLED IT, MAN.
YOU CALLED IT.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.629
MY DAD WOULD NEVER
SAY ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT THE THEME.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.231
WELL...
DAD, YOU ROCKED!

14:58.265 --> 15:00.367
NO. DUDE,
YOU UNDERSTAND, MAN!

15:00.400 --> 15:01.468
NOT LIKE MY DAD.
IF HE WAS HERE
RIGHT NOW,

15:01.501 --> 15:04.571
HE'D BE ON HIS
CELL PHONE CALLING
EVERYBODY'S PARENTS.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.706
MAN, WE WOULD BE
SO NAILED, MAN.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.441
YEAH! LILY,
YOU WERE SO RIGHT!

15:08.475 --> 15:11.544
YOUR DAD'S
THE ONE TO CALL.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.215
SO YOU SEE?
I'M AN IDIOT.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.285
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THEY WERE TOTALLY
PLAYING ME.

15:18.318 --> 15:19.219
Walt: YEAH.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.954
IT'S AMAZING HOW
YOUR CREDIBILITY AS A PARENT

15:20.988 --> 15:25.325
JUST FLIES OUT THE WINDOW
WHEN YOU LOOK LIKE ZZ TOP.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.628
ANYWAY...

15:28.661 --> 15:30.663
SO TELL ME,
BRIAN IS IT?
YEAH.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.333
HEY, WHERE
DO YOU LIVE, MAN?

15:33.366 --> 15:34.434
UH,
354 HARRISON.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.437
ALL RIGHT!
HEY, YOU THINK YOUR
PARENTS ARE STILL UP?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.639
NO WAY, DUDE.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.509
GOOD. THAT WAY
I GET TO WAKE 'EM.

15:42.542 --> 15:45.212
OH, CRAP.

15:45.245 --> 15:46.146
WHAT THESE KIDS DID,

15:46.179 --> 15:49.549
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
TO DESCRIBE IT
THAN...

15:49.582 --> 15:52.152
WILDING.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.254
I--I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WERE ON--

15:54.287 --> 15:57.357
SMACK, CRANK,
CRACK...

15:57.390 --> 16:01.194
FLAKE...SMANK.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.596
FRIENDLY BEAR?

16:03.630 --> 16:04.464
DEAD.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.433
THE LITTLE
WOODCHUCK?

16:06.466 --> 16:07.600
DEAD.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.237
THE OTTER
WITH THE BANJO?

16:10.270 --> 16:12.105
DEAD.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.477
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT YOU'VE DONE?

16:17.510 --> 16:21.048
YOU HAVE LITERALLY
PUSHED ME OFF A CLIFF!

16:21.081 --> 16:23.616
YOU HAVE LITERALLY
PUSHED ME TO MY DEATH!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.653
I AM LITERALLY DEAD
THANKS TO YOU.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.454
ME?!

16:27.487 --> 16:28.655
LOOK, I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO HOOKED UP

16:28.688 --> 16:30.723
WITH THE BEASTIE BOYS
FOR AN OUT-OF-STATE
DRINKING BINGE!

16:30.757 --> 16:33.293
THAT IS SO UNFAIR!
I ONLY HAD ONE DRINK.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.328
EVERYONE ELSE
HAD, LIKE, 5.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.496
OH, WELL, GREAT.
THEN YOU WERE SOBER

16:36.529 --> 16:38.465
COMPARED TO THE BOY
WHO WAS GOING TO BE
DRIVING YOU HOME

16:38.498 --> 16:39.632
TO YOUR CERTAIN DEATH!

16:39.666 --> 16:41.368
OH, YOU ARE
SO EMBARRASSING,

16:41.401 --> 16:43.236
I AM LITERALLY
DYING OF EMBARRASSMENT!

16:43.270 --> 16:45.738
YOU KNOW, I REALLY WISH
YOU WOULD LOOK UP
THE WORD LITERALLY,

16:45.772 --> 16:47.140
BECAUSE--

16:47.174 --> 16:48.541
AAH--AAH!

16:49.142 --> 16:50.543
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
FIGHTING?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.378
WE'RE NOT FIGHTING.

16:51.411 --> 16:54.381
AM I GOING TO BE
PUT IN A FOSTER HOME?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.715
POTENTIALLY.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.517
YOU'RE NOT HELPING, DAD!

16:57.550 --> 16:59.486
HA HA HA.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.389
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.257
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

17:04.291 --> 17:04.991
I'M GOING OUT.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.360
OK, EVEN YOU
DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.561
I TRUSTED YOU.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.463
YOU TRUSTED ME?

17:10.497 --> 17:12.665
AND WITH
A STRAIGHT FACE. WHOO!

17:12.699 --> 17:14.701
I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT ALLISON'S.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.069
IN FACT, YOU'RE NOT.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.337
OH, I'M NOT, AM I?

17:17.370 --> 17:20.773
NO. IN FACT, YOU ARE
STAYING IN THIS ROOM
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

17:20.807 --> 17:24.477
WHAT, ARE YOU
GOING TO MAKE ME?

17:25.312 --> 17:25.945
IT COULD HAPPEN.

17:25.978 --> 17:29.849
I AM LITERALLY
GOING INSANE!

17:29.882 --> 17:31.218
ALL RIGHT! GOOD USAGE!

17:31.251 --> 17:32.752
NOW LET ME
GO TO ALLISON'S.

17:32.785 --> 17:33.520
NO!

17:33.553 --> 17:35.555
YOU CAN'T STOP ME.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.590
YES, I CAN!

17:43.396 --> 17:44.364
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.699
WHEN I HEAR THE WHOLE STORY
OUT LOUD, IT JUST...

17:46.733 --> 17:50.603
MAKES ME REALIZE
THAT I'M THE WORST
DAD IN THE WORLD.

17:50.637 --> 17:55.608
COME ON. YOU'RE
NOT EVEN THE WORST
DAD IN THIS HOUSE.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.582
WHAT WOULD
YOU HAVE DONE?

18:02.615 --> 18:04.184
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.185
I NEVER KNOW.

18:05.218 --> 18:09.256
I GUESS
YOUR BARRICADE IS
AS GOOD AS ANYTHING.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.590
YEAH. THING IS,
YOU KNOW, I--

18:10.623 --> 18:11.758
I DON'T WANT
TO BE THE KIND OF GUY

18:11.791 --> 18:14.294
WHO SCOLDS HIS KID
FOR GETTING DRUNK
AT ACTION MOUNTAIN.

18:14.327 --> 18:19.166
I WANT TO BE
THE GUY GETTING DRUNK
AT ACTION MOUNTAIN.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.135
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING TUESDAY?

18:22.802 --> 18:24.671
I GOT A JOB.
I GOT KIDS TO FEED.

18:24.704 --> 18:28.141
OH. ALL RIGHT.
I'LL CALL KENNY, THEN.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.179
I KNOW. I KNOW, BABY,
THAT YOU WANT

18:32.212 --> 18:33.580
TO BE THE DRUNK GUY
AT ACTION MOUNTAIN.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.415
BELIEVE ME,
I WANT TO BE THE GIRL

18:35.448 --> 18:39.352
THAT HOLDS HIS HAIR BACK
WHEN HE PUKES.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.420
BUT WE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH
OF KIDS HERE,

18:40.453 --> 18:44.324
SO WE GOT
TO STICK IT OUT
UNTIL THEY GROW UP OR...

18:44.357 --> 18:45.825
RUN AWAY.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.828
GOD, WHO
ARE WE KIDDING?

18:48.861 --> 18:51.498
THEY'RE NEVER
GOING TO RUN AWAY.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.535
NO, I MEANT US.

18:56.203 --> 18:58.605
OH, COME ON. SHE'S GOING
TO GET INTO TROUBLE.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.574
IT'S INEVITABLE.
SHE'S GOING TO
RUN AROUND WITH BOYS.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.443
SHE'S 14 YEARS OLD!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.379
I KNOW
SHE'S 14 YEARS OLD.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.516
DO YOU REALIZE
IN 4 SHORT YEARS, SHE
WILL BE THE SAME AGE

19:09.549 --> 19:12.652
I WAS WHEN YOU GOT ME
PREGNANT WITH HER?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.888
I BETTER GO
TALK TO HER.
GO TALK TO HER.

19:17.990 --> 19:22.529
OK, LILY. I THINK
YOU'VE LEARNED
YOUR LESSON, SO, UH...

19:22.562 --> 19:27.367
I'M GONNA UNBARRICADE
YOUR DOOR NOW.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.437
HO, NO, NO!
OH, NO, MISSY!

19:30.470 --> 19:32.639
OH, NO, NO.
I AM NOT LOCKED OUT!

19:32.672 --> 19:34.807
YOU ARE LOCKED IN!

19:37.977 --> 19:38.878
UH!

19:45.418 --> 19:46.819
HEY!

19:48.288 --> 19:49.922
CAN I HELP YOU?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.524
UH, UH...YEAH!

19:51.558 --> 19:55.295
YEAH, LILY.
ABOUT TONIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.731
YOU ARE A MINOR. OK?

19:58.765 --> 19:59.699
AND I OWN YOU.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.569
AND THE COPS WILL
TOTALLY BACK ME UP
ON THIS.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.304
SO AS LONG AS
THAT'S THE CASE,

20:04.337 --> 20:06.906
I'M JUST ASKING THAT
YOU STAY, A--ALIVE,

20:06.939 --> 20:09.642
AND B--NOT PREGNANT.

20:09.676 --> 20:12.312
DAD, I'M NOT DUMB.
I GET IT.

20:12.345 --> 20:13.880
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO EMBARRASS ME.

20:13.913 --> 20:16.649
COME ON. EMBARRASS YOU
IN FRONT OF THOSE GUYS?

20:16.683 --> 20:19.852
LIL, THEY WERE
DRINKING SHAMPOO.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.722
HUH? ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.857
SO, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO RAISE HELL,

20:24.891 --> 20:25.858
DO IT WITH
THE SMART KIDS.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.560
THAT WAY, YOU
DON'T GET CAUGHT,

20:27.594 --> 20:30.463
I DON'T HAVE TO
FIND OUT ABOUT IT.

20:31.598 --> 20:32.765
ALL RIGHT.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.401
SO ARE WE COOL?

20:34.434 --> 20:37.337
WE COOL.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.339
COME HERE.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.276
OK, I'M GOING
TO ALLISON'S.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.611
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT!

20:44.644 --> 20:46.379
AAH!

20:47.547 --> 20:49.316
HA HA HA HA!

20:49.682 --> 20:50.617
WE'RE GOOD.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.684
YEAH?

20:51.718 --> 20:52.552
LET ME GUESS.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.788
YOU APOLOGIZED, THEN
THE HUGGING STARTED.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.825
NO, DAD. I TOLD HER
HOW THINGS WERE GOING TO BE,

20:58.858 --> 20:59.926
AND SHE DIDN'T LIKE IT,

20:59.959 --> 21:02.028
BUT SHE RESPECTED IT.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.331
HEY, HONEY!

21:04.364 --> 21:06.733
I'M DYEING MY HAIR.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.771
TH--THAT BOX IS BLUE.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.006
SHE THINKS
THAT'S GOING TO BUG ME,

21:14.040 --> 21:17.410
BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO.

21:17.444 --> 21:21.514
HONEY, PLEASE DON'T
DYE YOUR HAIR BLUE.
PLEASE!

21:22.014 --> 21:23.950
I GOT TO HAND IT
TO YOU, SON.

21:23.983 --> 21:26.753
YOU HANDLED THIS
VERY POORLY.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.088
COME ON, DAD.
GIVE HIM A BREAK.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.824
WE USED TO GET AWAY
WITH MURDER
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

21:31.858 --> 21:35.695
REMEMBER THAT POT PLANT
WE HAD GROWING
BEHIND THE HOUSE?

21:35.728 --> 21:39.466
IT WAS,
LIKE, 6 FEET TALL.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.468
'SCUSE ME?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.471
WHAT, WE NEVER
JOKED AROUND
ABOUT THIS BEFORE?

21:44.504 --> 21:45.071
NO. NO.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.073
I'M CALLING
THE POLICE.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.107
IT WAS A JOKE, DAD.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.576
YEAH, I'M
NOT JOKING.

21:49.609 --> 21:52.612
I WAS JOKING!

21:58.518 --> 21:59.318
MOM, LET'S SAY
CHRISTINA AND I
WERE TO GET TICKETS

21:59.352 --> 22:00.653
TO SEE
THE FOO FIGHTERS
AT THE GARDEN.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.422
SHOULD I TELL YOU
ABOUT IT OR NOT?

22:02.455 --> 22:03.590
YEAH, YOU SHOULD
TELL ME YOU'RE GOING,

22:03.623 --> 22:06.893
BUT YOU SHOULD TELL ME
CHRISTINA'S MOM'S
GOING WITH YOU.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.061
MMM. OK.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.130
SO DO YOU
HAVE TICKETS TO
THE FOO FIGHTERS?

22:11.163 --> 22:14.534
YEAH, BUT CHRISTINA'S
MOM IS GOING.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.535

22:15.568 --> 22:16.603

22:16.636 --> 22:18.905
OK. GOOD. HAVE FUN.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.408
OK. THANKS.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.412

22:25.445 --> 22:27.447
YES!
