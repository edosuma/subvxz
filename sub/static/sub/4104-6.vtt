WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.356
<i>I was born in space.</i>

00:05.523 --> 00:07.317
<i>I've never felt the sun on my face</i>

00:07.483 --> 00:10.403
<i>or breathed real air
or floated in the water.</i>

00:11.738 --> 00:12.739
<i>None of us have.</i>

00:13.031 --> 00:14.949
<i>For three generations,
the Ark has kept</i>

00:15.116 --> 00:17.201
<i>what's left of the human race alive.</i>

00:17.368 --> 00:19.412
<i>But now our home is dying,</i>

00:19.579 --> 00:22.373
<i>and we are the last hope of mankind.</i>

00:22.540 --> 00:25.668
<i>One hundred prisoners sent
on a desperate mission to the ground.</i>

00:26.377 --> 00:28.504
<i>Each of us is here
because we broke the law.</i>

00:28.671 --> 00:30.840
<i>On the ground, there is no law.</i>

00:31.007 --> 00:33.926
<i>All we have to do is survive,
but we will be tested</i>

00:34.093 --> 00:37.430
<i>by the Earth,
by the secrets it hides,</i>

00:37.639 --> 00:39.432
<i>and most of all, by each other.</i>

00:41.309 --> 00:43.061
<i>Previously on</i> The 100...

00:43.895 --> 00:46.064
- Calm down!
- We're dead to them! And we're alone!

00:46.230 --> 00:47.398
You're not alone!

00:47.565 --> 00:49.359
You're not alone.

00:55.573 --> 00:56.991
- Raven!
- Finn!

00:59.535 --> 01:03.081
<i>The council is voting whether
to kill 300 people to save air.</i>

01:03.247 --> 01:04.290
We have to tell them!

01:04.956 --> 01:06.668
The radio's gone.

01:21.307 --> 01:23.810
Mom, please, let me get a doctor.

01:23.976 --> 01:26.020
No! You can't tell anyone.

01:28.064 --> 01:29.816
Tell me what happens
if you do. Say it.

01:29.982 --> 01:31.651
You...
You get floated.

01:33.027 --> 01:34.696
I don't understand.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.073
Why is it wrong
to have more than one baby?

01:37.240 --> 01:40.326
The Ark couldn't survive.

01:41.494 --> 01:42.912
The chancellor can't allow it.

01:43.079 --> 01:46.666
He's, like,
the Emperor Augustus, right?

01:46.791 --> 01:47.917
Yes.

01:48.501 --> 01:51.879
That's right.
Just like the emperor we read about.

01:53.005 --> 01:54.966
The baby's coming.
Get the blanket.

02:04.809 --> 02:05.810
Mom.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.864
My brave boy.

02:19.741 --> 02:20.908
You have a sister.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.334
You should name her.

02:30.501 --> 02:32.795
Augustus had a sister.

02:35.173 --> 02:36.841
Octavia.

02:39.469 --> 02:41.846
Bellamy, you can't let her cry.

02:42.013 --> 02:43.139
Here. Give her to me.

02:46.517 --> 02:49.937
No, Mom.
Mom, you can't fall asleep.

02:50.104 --> 02:51.689
I'm so tired.

02:55.109 --> 02:56.277
Your sister.

02:58.613 --> 02:59.822
Your responsibility.

03:02.450 --> 03:06.078
Mom! Mom, what do I do? Mom!

03:10.208 --> 03:11.208
Shh.

03:11.626 --> 03:12.752
Please.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.003
Shh.

03:22.678 --> 03:26.724
See? I told you.
It's okay.

03:26.891 --> 03:30.561
I won't let anything
bad happen to you, Octavia.

03:31.354 --> 03:33.064
I promise.

03:38.361 --> 03:39.862
Octavia!

03:43.157 --> 03:44.700
Hey.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.209
You're up?

03:56.420 --> 03:58.422
Yeah, knowing that hundreds of people

03:58.589 --> 04:00.609
might be dying on the Ark
makes it pretty hard to sleep.

04:00.633 --> 04:01.843
Raven's flares will work.

04:02.009 --> 04:03.845
Her radio would've worked better.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.430
Have you seen Octavia?

04:06.597 --> 04:10.434
No. I mean, it's Octavia.
She's probably chasing butterflies.

04:10.601 --> 04:12.687
Clarke, I've checked the camp.
She's not here.

04:15.731 --> 04:17.440
Okay. I'll help you find her.

04:17.608 --> 04:20.152
Let's check again.
You go to the dropship.

04:20.319 --> 04:22.029
I'll check the rest of the tents.

04:22.196 --> 04:23.739
Thank you.

04:23.906 --> 04:25.992
Don't thank me.
I'm not doing this for you.

04:26.158 --> 04:28.077
I'm doing it for Octavia.

05:22.924 --> 05:24.717
Please, please don't hurt me.

05:24.884 --> 05:28.888
Please don't! No!
Aah! No! No!

05:29.055 --> 05:31.974
Please! No! No!

05:39.857 --> 05:43.069
Hey, everybody,
gather around and grab a weapon.

05:45.738 --> 05:47.698
My sister's been out
there alone for 12 hours.

05:47.865 --> 05:50.284
Arm up.
We're not coming back without her.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.749
Hey, Jasper,
you don't have to do this.

05:56.916 --> 05:58.796
You haven't left camp
since we brought you back.

05:58.876 --> 06:02.129
Clarke, I need to do this.

06:02.296 --> 06:04.006
We need all the people we can get.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.347
We need a tracker.

06:11.514 --> 06:13.766
Finn. Get out here.

06:13.933 --> 06:15.184
You want to lose an ear?

06:15.351 --> 06:18.396
Can't believe you let
it get so long in lockup.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.565
This couldn't wait till morning?

06:21.732 --> 06:22.775
I was inspired.

06:22.942 --> 06:27.071
So. What did you want to talk about?

06:30.574 --> 06:32.910
Nothing. It can wait.

06:35.538 --> 06:37.957
That wasn't your "nothing" face.

06:38.124 --> 06:40.209
That was your
"going on a spacewalk" face.

06:41.419 --> 06:42.461
No more spacewalks.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.589
Get some rest, okay?

06:48.009 --> 06:49.802
Finn, we're leaving.

06:50.594 --> 06:52.096
All right. I'm coming.

06:54.932 --> 06:56.392
Hey.

06:56.559 --> 06:58.769
- Hey, wait.
- Nice hair.

07:01.439 --> 07:02.815
We should talk about this.

07:03.899 --> 07:07.236
You have a girlfriend, Finn.
There's really nothing left to say.

07:07.403 --> 07:08.571
Hey, hold on.

07:09.572 --> 07:12.950
It's true. I care about Raven.

07:15.119 --> 07:17.204
But you and me, we started something.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.331
It's nothing we can't stop.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.250
Are you sure?

07:24.962 --> 07:26.422
Because I'm not.

07:30.134 --> 07:31.469
Guys, guys. Come here!

07:31.635 --> 07:33.345
What is that?

07:33.512 --> 07:35.723
It's so bright. Did you see that?

07:37.767 --> 07:39.852
Look up there.

07:42.313 --> 07:43.522
It's so beautiful.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.149
They didn't work.

07:46.442 --> 07:49.445
- They didn't see the flares.
- A meteor shower tells you that?

07:49.612 --> 07:53.365
It's not a meteor shower,
it's a funeral.

07:53.532 --> 07:55.892
Hundreds of bodies being returned
to the Earth from the Ark.

07:56.035 --> 07:58.162
This is what it looks
like from the other side.

08:00.664 --> 08:02.666
They didn't get our message.

08:04.794 --> 08:07.463
- This is all because of you!
- I helped you find the radio.

08:07.630 --> 08:10.257
Yeah, after you jacked it
from my pod and trashed it!

08:10.424 --> 08:12.676
Yeah, he knows.
Now he has to live with it.

08:18.307 --> 08:20.786
All I know is that my sister
is out there and I'm gonna find her.

08:20.810 --> 08:22.853
- You coming or what?
- Yeah.

08:24.855 --> 08:26.649
What are we waiting for?

08:26.816 --> 08:29.276
- Move out!
- We have to talk to them.

08:29.443 --> 08:30.694
Three hundred won't be enough.

08:30.861 --> 08:32.863
The oxygen level
will just keep dropping.

08:33.030 --> 08:35.198
If we don't tell them that
they can survive down here,

08:35.366 --> 08:36.991
they'll kill more people,
they have to.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.578
Guys. They're leaving.
We gotta go.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.960
I gotta do this.

08:46.127 --> 08:47.920
And you should stay
and fix the radio, okay?

08:48.087 --> 08:50.047
Fix it? The transmitter's smashed.

08:50.214 --> 08:51.924
Unless there's a parts depot
down here,

08:52.091 --> 08:54.301
we're not talking to the Ark.

08:55.719 --> 08:56.762
Art supply store.

09:00.015 --> 09:02.476
I know a place you might be
able to get a transmitter.

09:05.396 --> 09:08.732
Great. It looks like
you're coming with me instead.

09:10.067 --> 09:13.362
Finn? We're not gonna
find her without you.

09:16.782 --> 09:18.450
Be careful.

09:19.076 --> 09:20.077
Hey.

09:24.123 --> 09:25.166
I love you.

09:30.254 --> 09:31.589
I love you, too.

09:37.052 --> 09:38.387
It's this way.

09:54.612 --> 09:55.946
Hello?

09:59.408 --> 10:01.118
Is anybody here?

10:13.505 --> 10:14.840
He fixed it?

11:54.440 --> 11:55.774
Look! Over here!

11:55.941 --> 11:57.151
<i>Find something?</i>

11:57.318 --> 11:59.737
<i>Guys, come on, over here.</i>

12:00.696 --> 12:01.697
What is it?

12:01.864 --> 12:04.908
Right there. You see it?
Is that Octavia's?

12:05.075 --> 12:06.368
Rope.

12:10.247 --> 12:12.666
- What are you doing?
- We need the rope to get back up.

12:15.210 --> 12:16.503
Flashlight.

12:31.101 --> 12:32.644
It's hers.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.689
I'm going all the way down.

12:42.071 --> 12:43.947
Serious?

13:05.969 --> 13:08.097
Someone else was here.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.935
The prints are deeper going that way.

13:15.104 --> 13:16.814
He was carrying her.

13:19.316 --> 13:21.944
If they took her, she's alive.

13:22.111 --> 13:23.987
Like when they took me.

14:32.890 --> 14:34.308
I don't speak Grounder...

14:35.309 --> 14:37.311
...but I'm pretty sure
this means keep out.

14:37.478 --> 14:39.605
Let's get out of here. It's crazy.

14:39.771 --> 14:42.983
- I'm outta here.
- Yeah, me, too.

14:43.901 --> 14:45.819
Go back if you want.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.697
My sister, my responsibility.

14:52.034 --> 14:54.536
I'd walk into hell to find her.

14:56.246 --> 14:57.247
No, no way.

14:58.624 --> 15:00.209
I think we just did.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.261
Go!

15:13.722 --> 15:15.599
I want another pony ride.

15:15.766 --> 15:17.309
You want another one?

15:17.476 --> 15:20.979
Okay, you want to go through
the jungle or the forest?

15:21.146 --> 15:24.942
I want to see the Ark, Bell.
Take me out the door.

15:25.108 --> 15:27.361
That's enough. Both of you.

15:29.196 --> 15:30.656
It's time.

15:30.822 --> 15:32.324
But... no.

15:32.491 --> 15:35.285
I don't want to!
How do you even know?

15:35.452 --> 15:39.373
Yeah, Mom, tell us how you're never
surprised by surprise inspections.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.500
Mind yourself, Bellamy Blake.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.962
Tell your sister what happens
if they find her.

15:45.128 --> 15:48.298
She knows what happens.
You've told her a thousand times.

15:49.466 --> 15:51.718
Oh. You know the drill.

15:52.636 --> 15:54.388
I hate the drill.

15:54.555 --> 15:56.515
Sometimes I wish
I was never even born.

15:58.350 --> 16:02.938
Stop it, Octavia. I know you're afraid,
but fear is a demon.

16:03.105 --> 16:06.984
Close your eyes and tell yourself
that you are not afraid.

16:07.818 --> 16:09.152
That is how you slay the demon.

16:11.154 --> 16:13.115
<i>- Inspection! Open up!</i>
- Say it.

16:13.282 --> 16:15.576
I'm not afraid.

16:15.742 --> 16:16.994
Okay.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.622
No!

16:26.920 --> 16:28.964
<i>Open the door, now!</i>

16:39.600 --> 16:41.935
Miss Blake,
by authority of the council,

16:42.102 --> 16:43.742
we're here to perform
a random inspection.

16:43.854 --> 16:45.772
Inspector Grus,
it's good to see you.

16:48.358 --> 16:50.444
Your uniform's ready.

16:53.196 --> 16:55.282
There you go. Just like new.

16:56.992 --> 16:58.327
Do you have something for me?

17:02.956 --> 17:05.459
Bellamy's letter of recommendation.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.755
You think you're guard material, kid?

17:09.921 --> 17:11.320
Come here.
Let's have a look at you.

17:14.925 --> 17:16.428
I'm good, thanks.

17:16.595 --> 17:21.016
- Bellamy. Stand up. Now.
- I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.435
I don't think so.

17:24.603 --> 17:26.229
You want to be in the guard or not?

17:28.857 --> 17:30.108
Come here, three seconds.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.112
One... two...

17:35.947 --> 17:37.574
Bellamy!

17:37.741 --> 17:41.078
- I'm so sorry, Inspector. I...
- Don't be.

17:41.244 --> 17:43.455
Maybe the guard
will make a man out of him.

17:43.622 --> 17:45.207
- Clean that up.
- Sir.

17:48.293 --> 17:51.588
Come to my quarters later.
He'll get that recommendation.

17:56.259 --> 17:58.720
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

18:00.722 --> 18:04.559
I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid.

18:11.775 --> 18:13.443
I'm not afraid.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.813
They're so beautiful.

18:49.980 --> 18:51.898
Raven, I know you
just got here yesterday,

18:52.065 --> 18:54.067
but we don't have time for this.
Come on.

18:55.861 --> 18:58.905
Hurry up and save the world.
You're just like your mom.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.782
I'm nothing like my mom.

19:00.949 --> 19:04.953
Relax. That's a compliment.
Abby's a badass.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.913
The pod was her idea.

19:07.080 --> 19:09.666
It broke her heart not being able
to come down with me,

19:09.833 --> 19:12.794
but she never stopped
believing you were alive.

19:12.961 --> 19:15.505
Yeah. Mother of the year.

19:15.672 --> 19:18.216
Well, my mom was
AWOL most of my life.

19:18.383 --> 19:20.135
When she did show up,
it was empty-handed.

19:20.302 --> 19:23.054
Pretty sure she had me just
to trade in my rations for moonshine.

19:27.476 --> 19:28.643
How'd you survive?

19:28.810 --> 19:30.604
Boy next door. Finn.

19:30.771 --> 19:35.108
He shared his rations.
Remembered my birthday.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.527
Saved my life.

19:37.694 --> 19:39.362
He's my family.

19:49.539 --> 19:51.333
I got nothing.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.376
We lost the trail.

19:53.543 --> 19:55.378
Keep looking.

20:01.426 --> 20:03.826
Wandering around aimlessly
isn't the way to find your sister.

20:03.929 --> 20:06.097
- We should backtrack...
- I'm not going back.

20:06.264 --> 20:08.850
Hey, where's John?

20:11.228 --> 20:12.854
I just saw him a second ago.

20:13.021 --> 20:15.899
Spread out. He couldn't
have gotten that far.

20:28.411 --> 20:29.412
They use the trees.

20:35.293 --> 20:37.653
- Shouldn't have crossed the boundary.
- Now can we go back?

20:37.796 --> 20:40.465
There, right there.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.468
Another one.

20:45.595 --> 20:46.721
We should run.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.361
Let's try this one.

21:04.406 --> 21:06.575
How did you find this place?

21:06.741 --> 21:09.286
I didn't. Finn found it.

21:12.330 --> 21:14.040
Hey, will this work?

21:14.207 --> 21:17.043
Sweet. RF.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.337
Radio frequency.

21:20.505 --> 21:23.800
If we can just find the controller,
we'll be golden.

21:23.967 --> 21:25.427
All right.

21:33.685 --> 21:35.312
Finn made this.

21:39.107 --> 21:40.317
Oh, yeah.

21:41.902 --> 21:45.155
We saw this two-headed deer
our first day on the ground.

21:45.322 --> 21:47.574
Welcome to paradise, right?

21:50.619 --> 21:52.287
Got it.

22:05.508 --> 22:06.968
Finn always does that.

22:07.135 --> 22:09.137
Finds the beauty in the unexpected.

22:12.265 --> 22:13.350
Good to go?

22:14.184 --> 22:16.186
Hurry up and save the world, right?

22:16.353 --> 22:18.688
Yeah. We're good.

22:18.855 --> 22:20.106
Okay.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.702
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Let's go, come on!

22:34.204 --> 22:36.044
What are we gonna do?
They keep heading us off.

22:36.081 --> 22:37.707
Just keep running.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.703
- I can't run much longer!
- I'm not stopping for him!

22:40.835 --> 22:43.035
- I'm sick of running anyway.
- Hey, what are you doing?

22:43.129 --> 22:45.048
They know where she is.

22:46.883 --> 22:48.718
Diggs, where are you?

22:48.885 --> 22:49.928
Roma!

23:00.772 --> 23:02.399
Aah!

23:03.066 --> 23:05.026
- Wait! Roma.
- Could be more. Stop.

23:07.320 --> 23:10.323
They were leading us here.
It's the only direction we could run in.

23:10.490 --> 23:14.244
Hey. Where'd they go?

23:15.704 --> 23:16.871
After Roma.

23:26.381 --> 23:27.465
Aah!

24:04.753 --> 24:07.047
Oh. You'll never guess
what's about to happen.

24:07.964 --> 24:10.592
Inspection. I'll get in the hole.

24:10.759 --> 24:14.554
No, no, no, no, no.
Sit, sit.

24:14.721 --> 24:16.097
This is great.

24:17.057 --> 24:19.851
Please, Bell, I don't want to hear
about another amazing moonrise

24:20.018 --> 24:21.537
when I'm never
gonna be able to see one.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.521
You're going to see one right now.

24:23.688 --> 24:27.358
The Unity Day masquerade dance
starts in ten minutes.

24:27.525 --> 24:29.486
Now, I didn't want to say anything

24:29.652 --> 24:31.780
until I was sure my cadet unit
was working security.

24:31.946 --> 24:35.075
I'm gonna be there watching you
the entire time.

24:37.702 --> 24:39.329
This is real?

24:47.170 --> 24:48.171
How do I look?

24:51.132 --> 24:52.675
Mysterious.

24:52.842 --> 24:54.135
Bell, what about Mom?

24:54.302 --> 24:57.806
Will you stop worrying? We'll be back
before she even knows you're gone.

25:07.190 --> 25:09.192
Want to go for a walk?

25:29.587 --> 25:31.214
It's okay.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.781
Whoa.

27:20.823 --> 27:22.325
Who's that?

27:24.160 --> 27:26.371
Another girl who won't notice us.

27:58.236 --> 27:59.821
My leg.

28:02.532 --> 28:04.033
I need to rest.

28:17.338 --> 28:20.300
Thank you.
You saved my life.

28:23.678 --> 28:26.681
That girl back there, I knew her, so,
if she's here, then so is my brother.

28:26.848 --> 28:29.642
Please, you have to help him, too.
They'll kill him.

28:33.563 --> 28:36.566
You don't understand me, do you?
Great.

29:00.757 --> 29:02.925
Why are you taking care of me?

29:04.886 --> 29:07.305
You found me at the bottom
of that ravine.

29:08.765 --> 29:10.475
Fixed my knee.

29:10.641 --> 29:12.769
What the hell are you doing?

29:12.935 --> 29:14.854
Please don't do this.

29:15.021 --> 29:16.021
Aah!

29:16.064 --> 29:19.400
Stop it! No, stop it!

29:19.567 --> 29:23.738
Stop! Please!
Please don't do this.

29:33.164 --> 29:35.249
There she is. Roma!

29:54.727 --> 29:56.145
They're playing with us.

30:02.276 --> 30:03.653
She only came because of me.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.822
They can kill us whenever they want.

30:07.990 --> 30:10.576
Then they should get it over with!

30:10.743 --> 30:13.830
Come on!
We know you're out there!

30:13.996 --> 30:17.333
- You want to kill us!
- They're coming!

30:34.517 --> 30:36.018
They're leaving.

30:37.854 --> 30:40.690
That horn.
What does it mean?

30:40.857 --> 30:41.858
Acid fog.

30:43.776 --> 30:45.361
We have to run.

30:45.528 --> 30:47.071
There's no time.

31:00.710 --> 31:01.878
Nice eyes.

31:03.504 --> 31:04.881
What station are you from?

31:08.384 --> 31:10.553
<i>Solar flare alert.</i>

31:10.720 --> 31:15.641
<i>An x-class solar flare has begun
on the starboard side of the Ark.</i>

31:15.808 --> 31:20.396
<i>All citizens must report to
the nearest shelter zone immediately.</i>

31:20.563 --> 31:23.858
<i>This is not a test.
This is a solar flare alert.</i>

31:24.025 --> 31:25.693
Ready.

31:27.612 --> 31:29.906
- Bell, I need to get home!
- You will.

31:30.698 --> 31:34.952
Ladies and gentlemen, you know
the drill. Masks off. ID chips out.

31:35.119 --> 31:36.871
Bell, what do we do?

31:37.038 --> 31:40.291
Listen to me. Whatever happens,
get back home and get under the floor.

31:40.458 --> 31:42.418
You'll be safe there
from the flare, like always.

31:42.585 --> 31:44.921
What are you gonna do?

31:45.087 --> 31:46.756
Create a distraction.

31:46.923 --> 31:47.924
Go on.

31:48.090 --> 31:50.510
Bell, how do I get home?

31:55.014 --> 31:58.476
Cadet Blake.
Why is your weapon out?

31:58.643 --> 32:00.394
Mask off.

32:00.561 --> 32:02.855
Sir, she's... she's fine.
I already scanned her.

32:05.316 --> 32:06.317
You don't have a scanner.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.946
- ID, please.
- Please, Lieutenant Shumway,

32:10.112 --> 32:12.031
I'm begging you, she needs to leave.

32:12.198 --> 32:14.450
As a fellow guardsman,

32:14.617 --> 32:18.454
just let us walk out of here and
I'll do anything you want. Anything.

32:19.539 --> 32:23.251
You're not a guardsman yet, cadet.
ID, now.

32:29.632 --> 32:30.967
Stop her.

32:45.773 --> 32:47.191
How long are we supposed to wait?

32:47.358 --> 32:48.693
Will this even work?

32:48.859 --> 32:52.405
- We'll find out.
- No, we won't.

32:55.825 --> 32:57.243
There's no fog.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.414
Maybe it was a false alarm.

33:02.582 --> 33:03.749
They're coming back.

33:07.712 --> 33:09.213
I think he's alone.

33:10.047 --> 33:11.299
Now can we run?

33:12.592 --> 33:15.678
He doesn't see us.
I'm going after him.

33:15.845 --> 33:18.306
And what? Kill him?

33:18.472 --> 33:20.516
No. Catch him.

33:20.683 --> 33:23.436
Make him tell me where Octavia is,
then kill him.

33:25.021 --> 33:27.023
How do we know he's not
leading us into another trap?

33:27.189 --> 33:28.608
We don't.

33:35.531 --> 33:37.033
How's it coming?

33:40.494 --> 33:41.912
Are you okay?

33:42.079 --> 33:45.041
You hardly said a word
the whole way back from the bunker.

33:59.889 --> 34:01.098
Heh.

34:01.223 --> 34:03.100
- Raven...
- Tell me I'm wrong.

34:04.977 --> 34:06.896
Tell me Finn
didn't make this for you.

34:07.063 --> 34:09.023
Tell me you weren't
screwing my boyfriend

34:09.190 --> 34:11.734
as I was risking my ass
to come down here.

34:15.987 --> 34:17.239
I can't tell you that.

34:23.411 --> 34:24.955
He made one for me, too.

34:25.748 --> 34:27.583
Just in case you thought
you were special.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.214
Do you think I wanted this?

34:33.380 --> 34:35.925
I didn't even know you existed.

34:38.219 --> 34:40.679
Look, as far as he knew,
you were dead, Raven.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.806
Or you would have been soon enough.

34:42.973 --> 34:45.309
My mom, too, and everyone
we ever knew on the Ark,

34:45.476 --> 34:47.603
and there was nothing
we could do to stop it.

34:50.563 --> 34:52.565
He could've waited
more than ten days.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.744
Do you love him?

35:09.458 --> 35:10.626
I hardly know him.

36:09.769 --> 36:10.853
- Bellamy?
- Octavia.

36:12.563 --> 36:13.981
Get the key.

36:19.028 --> 36:22.323
- Monroe, watch the entrance.
- Okay.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.202
It's okay. You're okay.

37:02.071 --> 37:04.031
Cadet Blake.

37:04.198 --> 37:05.950
It's Janitor Blake now, Lieutenant.

37:08.869 --> 37:12.581
Commander. A lot's changed
in the past year. May I?

37:12.748 --> 37:14.976
You've got some nerve coming in here
after pushing the button

37:15.000 --> 37:18.003
- that floated my mother.
- I was following orders.

37:18.754 --> 37:20.114
What the hell do you want from me?

37:21.882 --> 37:24.042
You were a hell of a guardsman,
Bellamy, you know that?

37:25.386 --> 37:28.472
- Smart, hardworking, resourceful.
- I wasn't a guardsman.

37:28.639 --> 37:31.100
That's what you said.
I remember.

37:31.267 --> 37:34.107
You also said you'd do anything to
protect your sister. I remember, too.

37:34.979 --> 37:36.522
I hope that's still true.

37:39.608 --> 37:40.609
Is she okay?

37:42.486 --> 37:45.072
What I'm about to tell you
is classified.

37:46.824 --> 37:49.285
Chancellor Jaha has approved
a mission to Earth.

37:49.451 --> 37:51.411
He's sending the juvenile prisoners
to the ground.

37:51.537 --> 37:54.790
One hundred of them.
Your sister included.

37:54.957 --> 37:58.419
No, no. You can't. It's not safe.
You have to stop them.

37:58.586 --> 38:00.421
I wish I could.

38:02.256 --> 38:04.341
What I can do is get you
a seat on that dropship.

38:06.135 --> 38:07.136
You're right.

38:07.303 --> 38:10.472
It's doubtful those kids will survive,
but if you're there,

38:10.639 --> 38:12.016
at least Octavia won't be alone.

38:14.018 --> 38:16.020
What do I have to do?

38:20.190 --> 38:21.483
Kill the chancellor.

38:30.492 --> 38:32.036
How about I kill you instead?

38:33.996 --> 38:36.665
Kill me and your sister goes alone
to a radiation-soaked planet

38:36.832 --> 38:38.312
and you get floated like your mother.

38:42.212 --> 38:44.608
Ship launches in 20 minutes, Bellamy.
If you're gonna do this,

38:44.632 --> 38:47.051
we have to leave. Right now.

38:52.181 --> 38:53.974
- How did you find me?
- Followed him.

38:56.268 --> 38:58.520
We should go. Now.
Before he wakes up.

38:58.687 --> 39:00.272
He's not gonna wake up.

39:01.190 --> 39:04.109
- Bellamy, stop.
- He didn't hurt me. Let's just go.

39:04.276 --> 39:07.029
They started this. Finn. Move.

39:09.114 --> 39:10.574
Foghorn.

39:20.584 --> 39:22.294
Stop! That's my brother!

39:31.387 --> 39:33.722
Clarke! Where's Clarke?

39:36.225 --> 39:39.311
- Get Clarke now.
- Hey. I'm here. What's up?

39:40.729 --> 39:41.897
Octavia.

39:42.064 --> 39:44.316
Finn. Finn?

39:44.483 --> 39:47.152
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:48.445 --> 39:49.571
Oh, my God.

39:49.738 --> 39:50.906
He's alive.

39:51.073 --> 39:53.301
- Wouldn't let me take the knife out.
- No, that was a good call.

39:53.325 --> 39:55.911
Get him in the dropship now. Go!

39:58.038 --> 39:59.540
Clarke, can you save him?

40:00.499 --> 40:02.167
No. Not me.
I need my mother.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.711
I need to talk to her.

40:03.877 --> 40:06.839
- There's still no radio.
- Raven, fix it! Go!

40:09.842 --> 40:10.926
Hey, you okay?

40:12.136 --> 40:13.595
Okay. Yeah. Just go.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.932
Hey, hey.

40:17.766 --> 40:19.268
Why were you defending him?

40:19.435 --> 40:22.229
Because he saved my life,
that spear that hit Roma

40:22.396 --> 40:24.898
- was actually meant...
- No, you're wrong. I saved your life.

40:25.065 --> 40:27.210
For all you know, he was keeping you
alive to use you as bait

40:27.234 --> 40:29.862
- for one of their traps.
- No. I don't think so.

40:30.029 --> 40:32.740
You don't think, O!
That's the problem.

40:32.906 --> 40:35.784
They killed three
of our people today.

40:35.951 --> 40:38.013
And if you would've let me kill him
when I had the chance,

40:38.037 --> 40:39.788
Finn wouldn't be in there
dying right now.

40:39.955 --> 40:42.416
Stop blaming me for your mistakes.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.626
What happened to Finn
is not my fault.

40:44.793 --> 40:48.714
I wanted to leave, so if Finn dies
in there, that's on you.

40:51.258 --> 40:55.179
Everything that's gone wrong
is because of you.

40:55.345 --> 40:56.889
You got me locked up on the Ark.

40:57.056 --> 40:59.266
You wanted me to go
to that stupid dance.

40:59.433 --> 41:01.143
You got Mom killed!

41:05.314 --> 41:06.523
Me?

41:08.067 --> 41:09.651
Mom was floated for having you.

41:09.818 --> 41:12.446
She's dead because you're alive.

41:12.613 --> 41:14.740
That was her choice.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.658
I didn't have a choice.

41:17.868 --> 41:19.787
My life ended the day you were born.

41:26.835 --> 41:28.796
Where do you think you're going?

41:28.962 --> 41:30.839
You can't keep me locked
up in here forever.

41:40.015 --> 41:41.600
Get inside.

41:43.018 --> 41:44.186
Go!

41:49.650 --> 41:51.318
A storm's coming.
