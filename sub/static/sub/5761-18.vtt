00:08.200 --> 00:10.400
My name is 
Melinda Gordon.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.700
I'm married,

00:11.800 --> 00:14.000
I live in a small town,

00:14.100 --> 00:15.900
and I own an antique shop.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I might be just like you.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.900
Except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.300
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.500
It's all right, honey.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.800
Earthbound spirits,
my grandmother called them.

00:26.908 --> 00:29.400
They're stuck here, because they have
unfinished business with the living,

00:29.504 --> 00:33.201
and they come to me for help.

00:34.603 --> 00:40.008
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:51.601 --> 00:54.809
This bracelet is so cute.

00:54.909 --> 00:56.201
Hey, did you find anything?

00:56.305 --> 01:00.901
Check out this technicolor
ceramic chicken.

01:06.005 --> 01:08.802
You can check inside, folks, too.
Lots for sale.

01:08.906 --> 01:10.701
Just out of curiosity, why the sale?

01:10.807 --> 01:14.702
Some kind of lien, unpaid bills, taxes.
It's been in the courts for months.

01:14.806 --> 01:20.202
Woman ran out on her kid,
left everyone holding the bag.

01:26.106 --> 01:28.700
- Did you feel that?
- What?

01:28.808 --> 01:33.000
I don't know. Felt like
a cold spot or something.

01:33.106 --> 01:34.802
Probably getting sick or something.

01:34.907 --> 01:38.101
That's what happens
when I don't get enough sleep.

01:38.205 --> 01:39.700
So why aren't you sleeping?

01:39.806 --> 01:42.501
- Well, somebody's been keeping
me up at night. - Oh, really.

01:42.608 --> 01:45.901
Please. He has 4 legs and fur.

01:46.007 --> 01:49.203
- I thought that Bob the dog
was always quiet. - Yeah, was,

01:49.307 --> 01:52.601
but now he just starts barking for
no reason in the middle of the night.

01:52.705 --> 01:58.303
He's just growling at nothing.
It's just the weirdest thing.

01:59.608 --> 02:02.603
This is gorgeous.

02:04.806 --> 02:06.702
Turn of the century, you know,
before there was plastic,

02:06.805 --> 02:09.800
they used to make the snow
out of ground rice.

02:09.907 --> 02:12.000
The things you know.

02:12.107 --> 02:15.200
They have modernist lamps in the other
room, so I'm gonna go check it out.

02:15.305 --> 02:18.701
I'll see you back here.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.803
Get out. Leave.

02:56.907 --> 03:00.600
I'm sorry.
Is this your room?

03:02.005 --> 03:03.701
I knew I'd find you here.

03:03.808 --> 03:07.002
Do you know how out of their
minds worried the garnets are?

03:07.108 --> 03:09.601
Yeah, but this is my stuff.

03:09.707 --> 03:11.700
That's my mother's snow globe.

03:11.805 --> 03:14.802
- Yeah, this room isn't for sale.
- I'm so sorry.

03:14.907 --> 03:16.903
The door was open, so...

03:17.005 --> 03:19.901
- Come on, Julie.
- No! This is my house!

03:20.007 --> 03:24.200
But it isn't anymore.
Come on, Julie.

03:29.605 --> 03:31.102
- Uh, both of these.
- Thanks.

03:31.207 --> 03:33.801
Thank you.

03:35.205 --> 03:38.803
Hi. I think this is yours.

03:44.207 --> 03:48.000
- Go ahead. Take it.
- I don't want it.

03:48.106 --> 03:51.702
I ruin everything I touch.

04:07.607 --> 04:10.103
Melinda?

04:10.606 --> 04:14.700
God, let me get this thing off you.

04:14.807 --> 04:17.803
All right, there.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.803
What are you looking for?

04:21.906 --> 04:24.900
I don't know yet.

04:53.005 --> 04:57.002
EPISODE 2x18
"Children Of Ghosts"

05:12.205 --> 05:15.000
Mr. Wheeler. Hi.
I'm Melinda Gordon.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.601
Ok.

05:16.707 --> 05:19.803
Uh, I called you about Julie.

05:19.908 --> 05:23.600
I was at the estate sale yesterday
at the house, remember?

05:23.706 --> 05:26.403
I thought I asked you to call back
next week for an appointment.

05:26.507 --> 05:28.900
Oh, well, I thought you said
to come by today

05:29.008 --> 05:33.001
and you'd be delighted
to talk about Julie.

05:33.106 --> 05:34.702
Ms. Gordon,

05:34.805 --> 05:38.401
I can't give out any information
about kids in the state's care.

05:38.507 --> 05:40.202
Are you applying to be a foster parent?

05:40.308 --> 05:43.703
No, but in my profession,
I deal with troubled people every day,

05:43.806 --> 05:47.800
and I recognized some of Julie's issues,
so if I could just talk to her...

05:47.907 --> 05:50.001
- Are you a licensed therapist?
- No.

05:50.105 --> 05:52.100
- Psychiatrist?
- No, but...

05:52.208 --> 05:53.800
- Pediatrician?
- No.

05:53.907 --> 05:57.902
- Do you have a card?
- Aha. Yes.

06:06.307 --> 06:09.601
When Julie needs a faberge egg,
we'll give you a call.

06:09.708 --> 06:13.102
Thanks for your concern.

07:02.807 --> 07:05.503
Bob! What?!

07:05.907 --> 07:07.601
Oh! Is that psycho Bob?

07:07.705 --> 07:10.600
Yes. You know, I just didn't
wanna leave him home again,

07:10.708 --> 07:12.700
in case that's what was
driving him crazy.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.100
I know I should've asked.
I'm sorry.

07:14.205 --> 07:19.003
No. What better place for
a mad dog than the...

07:20.708 --> 07:22.001
antique shop?

07:22.108 --> 07:25.402
See that? It's like he's being chased
by some demon or something.

07:25.506 --> 07:27.002
- Bob, sit!
- Yeah.

07:27.105 --> 07:28.402
Something like that.

07:28.508 --> 07:31.200
Ok, you know what?
We are gonna go to the vet.

07:31.306 --> 07:33.702
It's probably just his collar's
too tight or something like that.

07:33.807 --> 07:35.802
Hey, you know what?
If I give you a name,

07:35.907 --> 07:37.402
could you track down an address?

07:37.507 --> 07:39.803
Yeah, sure. I still have
all my real estate contacts.

07:39.908 --> 07:41.803
- What's the name?
- Garnet.

07:41.906 --> 07:42.903
Sure.

07:43.008 --> 07:43.902
Come on, babe.

07:44.008 --> 07:46.300
Homer, do you see a light?

07:46.408 --> 07:49.203
Ok, then, go.

07:49.705 --> 07:52.402
Not that way.

07:52.506 --> 07:54.501
We took Julie a few months ago.

07:54.608 --> 07:56.600
We love being foster parents.

07:56.708 --> 08:00.700
Mike and I have fostered
7 kids in the past 10 years.

08:00.805 --> 08:03.502
But we never had as much trouble
as we did with Julie.

08:03.607 --> 08:05.400
- You ok?
- Damn it!

08:05.505 --> 08:09.603
I told him to call master handyman.

08:10.406 --> 08:14.203
She did this, you know, Julie.

08:16.406 --> 08:17.703
She broke the door?

08:17.805 --> 08:19.000
What didn't she break?

08:19.105 --> 08:22.703
You know, we were her third
foster home in 2 months.

08:22.806 --> 08:26.501
So after she ran away from us, they sent
her back to the youth home, we think.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.503
I kind of feel like we failed.

08:28.605 --> 08:30.802
No, she never trusted us.

08:30.907 --> 08:33.102
And she was just so disruptive,

08:33.205 --> 08:36.001
- always seemed so sad.
- Kid's been through hell.

08:36.105 --> 08:40.802
- What kind of hell? - I'm sorry.
What is your interest in this again?

08:40.905 --> 08:44.801
I had the opportunity to meet her,
and, um...

08:44.905 --> 08:48.700
I was really affected by her, and I just
wanted to see if I could help somehow.

08:48.807 --> 08:51.002
Well, it's a pretty terrible story.

08:51.108 --> 08:54.103
She and her mother were very nomadic,
moving around all the time, you know,

08:54.205 --> 08:57.903
and she didn't really have a father.
I think he died before she was born.

08:58.006 --> 09:02.202
Anyway, they came to Grandview
about 6 months ago, and one day,

09:02.305 --> 09:06.103
Julie's mother told her that she
would pick her up at the bus stop,

09:06.205 --> 09:07.500
and she waited,

09:07.608 --> 09:10.602
and she waited...

09:12.705 --> 09:15.502
and her mother never showed up.

09:15.606 --> 09:17.201
So where did she go?

09:17.307 --> 09:19.200
Nobody knows.
She's still missing.

09:19.306 --> 09:22.100
Julie's caseworker told us that
she was wanted for some petty crimes,

09:22.206 --> 09:23.502
bouncing checks, stuff like that.

09:23.606 --> 09:27.303
I think she was just running away from
her responsibilities, her troubles.

09:27.407 --> 09:32.101
Did you ever see anything out of the
ordinary happening in the house?

09:32.206 --> 09:37.100
- What do you mean?
- Unusual things. Unexplainable things.

09:37.205 --> 09:40.101
No, not really.

09:41.308 --> 09:43.003
So how do you know she's haunted?

09:43.107 --> 09:45.401
Bracelets, posters,
the look on the Garnets' face

09:45.505 --> 09:48.402
when I asked if anything
unexplained had ever happened.

09:48.505 --> 09:52.801
You know, just because
the ghost hasn't shown itself,
that doesn't mean that it's not there.

09:52.906 --> 09:54.201
You think she knows?

09:54.306 --> 09:55.002
I doubt it.

09:55.105 --> 09:57.800
She probably just thinks she's a freak
and that no one wants her.

09:57.905 --> 09:59.902
2 feelings you have a passing
acquaintance with.

10:00.007 --> 10:02.603
At least my mom was there.
She may not have understood me,

10:02.705 --> 10:06.803
but I wasn't alone in the world
like her, you know?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.900
I just... I really feel for her.

10:09.005 --> 10:11.300
For all I know,
her mother could've died.

10:11.406 --> 10:14.001
Maybe that's who's haunting her.
Or maybe it's her father.

10:14.105 --> 10:19.000
Either way, I have to find some peace
for her and this ghost.

10:19.204 --> 10:20.701
Hey, there she is.

10:20.803 --> 10:23.308
Come on. I want you to meet Julie.
Come...

10:23.401 --> 10:26.109
Hey, Julie!

10:27.309 --> 10:29.100
Wait!

10:29.208 --> 10:31.700
Come on.

10:35.507 --> 10:36.500
Julie.

10:36.606 --> 10:41.800
You don't have to run away from me.
I just wanna talk.

10:43.405 --> 10:48.000
- You should be running from me.
- Why would you say that?

10:48.108 --> 10:52.401
Look, I know what you're going through.

10:54.207 --> 10:55.901
You don't know anything about me.

10:56.007 --> 10:59.600
I know that you're scared.

11:00.005 --> 11:02.600
And I know that you're confused...

11:02.705 --> 11:07.900
and I know that you miss your mom
and you hate her all at the same time.

11:08.008 --> 11:10.800
And I know that you're not
as different as you think.

11:10.908 --> 11:12.700
Hurry.
You need to go now.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.001
Look, I know what it's
like to lose a parent.

11:15.108 --> 11:19.200
No, she's coming back.
I know she is.

11:19.308 --> 11:22.701
Please, please go away!

11:37.205 --> 11:39.700
Melinda!

12:01.006 --> 12:02.500
What's gonna happen to her?

12:02.605 --> 12:06.501
She's gonna be transferred to a
state facility for troubled teens.

12:06.606 --> 12:09.302
We're just waitin' for
a bed to open up.

12:09.406 --> 12:12.501
Well, thanks again.

12:19.307 --> 12:21.600
Who's gonna understand her
in a place like that?

12:21.706 --> 12:24.901
Look, maybe we can find out where she's
going, get special visiting privileges.

12:25.006 --> 12:26.703
No. We have to help her.

12:26.805 --> 12:29.001
We have to help her, Jim, right now.

12:29.107 --> 12:30.603
How?

12:30.705 --> 12:35.802
Bring her to the one place in Grandview
where someone will understand her.

12:35.906 --> 12:40.403
You're talking about becoming
foster parents.

12:40.505 --> 12:41.500
Mel, that's a huge commitment.

12:41.606 --> 12:44.300
Look, I'm not talking about
anything permanent, ok?

12:44.406 --> 12:47.700
But I have to do whatever it takes
to get into that little girl's life
and help her.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.003
I know. I know.
I know how much you wanna help her.

12:50.106 --> 12:51.901
I know how much you feel for her,
and I love you for that.

12:52.008 --> 12:53.403
I don't know how you could even

12:53.508 --> 12:57.701
add a "but" at the end of that,
but I can feel it coming.

12:57.805 --> 12:59.803
You see yourself in this girl,

12:59.906 --> 13:02.002
but you have to ask yourself

13:02.108 --> 13:04.203
who are you trying to help here,

13:04.306 --> 13:07.301
yourself or her?

13:07.508 --> 13:12.503
You can't fix 2 broken hearts
by trying to stitch them together.

13:12.605 --> 13:15.102
That is the sappiest thing
I have ever heard.

13:15.206 --> 13:16.400
Yeah, I don't know
where I got that one.

13:16.506 --> 13:17.901
Look,

13:18.005 --> 13:20.102
it's not just me that she needs.

13:20.206 --> 13:22.603
It's you, too.

13:22.708 --> 13:29.102
We just have to do it long enough to
get whatever's haunting her to leave.

13:30.108 --> 13:33.501
Jim, it's the only way.

13:36.707 --> 13:39.701
That was the social worker.
We are finally approved.

13:39.806 --> 13:43.300
That's fantastic.
Oh, Melinda, I'm so happy for you.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.903
I almost can't even believe it,
between the office interviews,

13:46.005 --> 13:50.101
the in-home studies, the background
checks, it's easier to become a spy.

13:50.206 --> 13:53.103
Ok, what else don't I know about you?

13:53.206 --> 13:55.502
And it really helps that
Jim is an E.M.T., you know,

13:55.608 --> 13:58.400
with the medical training,
county employee.

13:58.508 --> 14:00.500
If it weren't for him,
it would take at least 2 months.

14:00.607 --> 14:02.302
- So when is she coming?
- Today!

14:02.405 --> 14:04.503
I have to go get the guest room
ready and grocery shop.

14:04.607 --> 14:06.003
Lots of frosted cereals.

14:06.107 --> 14:09.001
This is gonna be great
for you and for Jim.

14:09.107 --> 14:12.301
Well, it's just temporary, until
they can find a more permanent family.

14:12.408 --> 14:14.803
Hey, speaking of families, where's Bob?

14:14.905 --> 14:16.401
You know, I brought him to the vet.

14:16.507 --> 14:19.000
Yesterday I fed him, and he just
stood back from the bowl

14:19.107 --> 14:21.200
and started growling at the food.

14:21.306 --> 14:23.100
It was so strange.

14:23.205 --> 14:26.501
I just wanna make sure nothing
neurological's going on.

14:26.607 --> 14:28.002
Anyway, I'm bringin' in the big guns.

14:28.108 --> 14:32.302
A saw a sign up at the bookstore
that this superstar dog behaviorist

14:32.407 --> 14:35.403
is doing a book signing today,
and you can bring your dog in

14:35.508 --> 14:38.701
to get a, I don't know,
therapy session, I guess.

14:38.808 --> 14:41.000
Great. So we'll have a double date.

14:41.105 --> 14:45.702
You bring the dogs,
and I'll meet you there.

14:58.506 --> 15:03.100
Ok, ladies, you're next
to see Cesar Millan.

15:09.305 --> 15:12.303
Hi. This is Bob.

15:13.105 --> 15:13.901
Bob, down.

15:14.005 --> 15:15.001
Does he always act this way?

15:15.107 --> 15:18.801
Well, no. He used to be
the calmest dog around.

15:18.906 --> 15:22.401
Has anything changing in his life
lately, like meeting a dog or friend,

15:22.506 --> 15:23.601
you know, person?

15:23.706 --> 15:27.001
You know, I'm dating somebody new,
but Bob seems to really love him.

15:27.105 --> 15:30.301
He gets very excited every time
he's arou...

15:30.408 --> 15:31.103
Sit!

15:31.208 --> 15:33.502
He's exhibiting something
more territorial-like,

15:33.605 --> 15:39.701
like there's another dog around us
here, but there's no dog in here.

15:41.806 --> 15:42.803
That dog has some issues.

15:42.907 --> 15:46.400
Can I ask you a question about my dog
since you are the dog whisperer?

15:46.507 --> 15:49.703
- Sure. Is he here?
- Uh, in a manner of speaking.

15:49.805 --> 15:52.300
I need for him to go somewhere.

15:52.407 --> 15:53.903
Let's just call it a room.

15:54.006 --> 15:54.102
Ok.

15:54.206 --> 15:58.003
It's not a living room, but...

15:58.107 --> 16:00.401
anyway, he doesn't wanna do it.

16:00.508 --> 16:03.500
All right. Well, what you need to do
is you need to embrace

16:03.606 --> 16:07.301
a pack leader mentality, become calm
and assertive, and then he'll go.

16:07.407 --> 16:10.103
- He will follow you.
- Ok, problem. Ooh!

16:10.207 --> 16:14.501
I don't really wanna go into that
particular room. Not yet, anyway.

16:14.707 --> 16:15.703
Well, it's actually very simple.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.201
Obviously your dog is
feeding on your energy.

16:18.306 --> 16:21.600
He's not hearing what you're saying.
So until you change your feelings

16:21.706 --> 16:24.503
about the room, then he will go
into that room.

16:24.606 --> 16:27.102
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:27.206 --> 16:30.102
See what I mean?

16:30.205 --> 16:31.703
Ok, Homer, now

16:31.805 --> 16:36.602
I am the boss of you. All right?
I'm the pack leader, so...

16:36.707 --> 16:38.400
I don't know. Go.

16:38.505 --> 16:40.700
Go.

16:50.408 --> 16:51.802
Are you ready?

16:51.906 --> 16:53.002
Want the truth?

16:53.105 --> 16:55.402
Look, if we can handle
one supernatural teenager,

16:55.505 --> 16:56.800
we can handle any child.

16:56.907 --> 16:58.700
Wait. Are you saying that your
biological clock is...

16:58.807 --> 17:01.603
Oh, no. Focus.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.001
- Hey, Julie.
- Welcome. Come on in.

17:06.105 --> 17:09.401
- Hi. Steve Wheeler.
- Jim Clancy. Let me... give me that.

17:09.507 --> 17:11.602
I really appreciate you all doing this.

17:11.707 --> 17:15.502
Oh, she has a retainer
that she wears at night.

17:15.606 --> 17:18.101
She takes it out to eat,
but otherwise, it stays in.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.200
Ok. Hey, are you hungry?

17:20.307 --> 17:23.502
You know what? We've got some snacks,
and for dinner, Jim is an awesome cook.

17:23.606 --> 17:26.603
He makes the best grilled cheese.
Or we could have burgers. Do you...

17:26.704 --> 17:30.502
do you like burgers? You know what?
Let me get you something to drink.

17:30.607 --> 17:31.400
That's fine.

17:31.508 --> 17:34.303
So, I'll check back with you
in a couple days.

17:34.405 --> 17:35.403
Any questions?

17:35.508 --> 17:39.101
About 600, but I can't
think of any right now.

17:39.206 --> 17:43.600
Come on. You want me
to show you around?

17:44.408 --> 17:46.701
- Do you have a piano?
- Oh, no, I'm sorry.

17:46.808 --> 17:47.702
Do you play?

17:47.806 --> 17:51.802
This is the dining room,
where we dine.

17:51.906 --> 17:55.202
Yeah, I was taking lessons from
a teacher on Kisbey Street.

17:55.305 --> 17:58.202
She was teaching me how to play
Ben Kweller songs.

17:58.305 --> 18:00.401
Well, that's a cool piano teacher.

18:00.507 --> 18:01.301
I love Ben Kweller.

18:01.408 --> 18:04.703
I started listening to him
when he was with radish.

18:04.806 --> 18:07.702
- When's your birthday?
- February 14.

18:07.808 --> 18:12.001
A valentine baby.
That's really cool.

18:12.506 --> 18:14.103
You know, as a belated
birthday present,

18:14.206 --> 18:17.003
I'd really like you to start
your lessons back.

18:17.105 --> 18:20.500
Ok? And meanwhile, um...

18:21.906 --> 18:28.400
I hope that you can accept this as a
down payment on your birthday present.

18:29.206 --> 18:31.801
Thank you.

18:34.107 --> 18:37.300
I'm kinda tired.
Do I have a place to sleep?

18:37.408 --> 18:40.602
Yes. Of course.
Jim, could you take her upstairs?

18:40.705 --> 18:43.500
Yeah, I'll show you.

18:43.605 --> 18:44.902
Nice to meet you.

18:45.008 --> 18:46.703
It'll take a while,
but you'll do fine.

18:46.808 --> 18:49.201
Really.

18:50.307 --> 18:54.502
Before I leave, can I have a moment?

18:58.806 --> 19:01.401
Look, It's probably nothing,
but I just wanted to let you know

19:01.507 --> 19:05.003
that the police got a hit
on Valerie Parker's bank account.

19:05.105 --> 19:08.002
Valerie Parker?

19:08.105 --> 19:10.101
It's Julie's mother.

19:10.206 --> 19:13.601
It's some bank activity.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.302
Payments made.

19:19.405 --> 19:22.103
We think she may be back in town.

19:22.207 --> 19:27.401
She may try to find Julie.
Just call me if she shows.

19:30.508 --> 19:34.301
Ok, then. I think I'll say good-bye.

19:34.407 --> 19:35.703
Oh, and...

19:35.807 --> 19:36.803
good luck.

19:36.908 --> 19:39.500
Although, I don't think
you'll need it.

19:39.606 --> 19:40.700
Thank you.

19:40.806 --> 19:43.501
Good night.

19:51.207 --> 19:57.602
Sorry that the room looks so uncool.
We never redid it after we moved in.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.602
There's some water
in case you get thirsty.

20:00.707 --> 20:03.102
Thanks.

20:03.405 --> 20:05.603
You have a big collection.

20:05.706 --> 20:09.201
Las Vegas, Philadelphia,
St. Louis, Grandview.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.703
Have you...

20:10.808 --> 20:12.900
have you been to all those cities?

20:13.008 --> 20:17.400
It's all the places
me and my mom lived.

20:17.505 --> 20:19.403
Which one were you born in?

20:19.505 --> 20:20.903
Grandview.

20:21.007 --> 20:26.302
Must be something special
about Grandview to come back.

20:28.406 --> 20:29.501
Well,

20:29.608 --> 20:32.903
that probably needs a new light bulb.

20:33.008 --> 20:36.401
I'll do it in the morning.

20:36.508 --> 20:38.403
This isn't gonna work, you know.

20:38.508 --> 20:40.502
Why not?

20:40.708 --> 20:42.803
You're gonna get hurt.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.700
I want you to know something.

20:45.805 --> 20:49.503
I know that what's happening
is not your fault.

20:49.607 --> 20:53.303
I'm not gonna give up on you.

20:58.207 --> 21:01.100
- Help me, Melinda.
- It's all right.

21:01.206 --> 21:03.701
Melinda!

21:04.705 --> 21:06.903
Mel?

21:31.007 --> 21:31.901
Julie...

21:32.008 --> 21:34.503
Melinda.

21:42.907 --> 21:44.902
Please...

21:45.005 --> 21:48.202
please make it stop.

21:53.307 --> 21:57.100
You have a haunted kid who tries
to maim you not once, but 3 times,

21:57.205 --> 21:59.701
and you're going to invite said
haunted kid into your house.

21:59.807 --> 22:01.900
It seemed like the thing to do.

22:02.007 --> 22:04.002
Look, I think that this ghost
might be the father,

22:04.107 --> 22:07.900
because the mother's still alive
but I haven't seen him yet, not once.

22:08.005 --> 22:09.102
Have a seat.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.802
No ghost, huh?

22:10.906 --> 22:13.503
Is this girl going through puberty?

22:13.608 --> 22:14.403
I didn't ask.

22:14.506 --> 22:16.802
Well, if you have these things
and a girl going through puberty,

22:16.906 --> 22:19.300
I would say what you have on your
hand is a classic poltergeist.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.003
I just told you I haven't seen a ghost.

22:21.108 --> 22:24.403
Precisely. There is no ghost in
a poltergeist, but it's confusing,

22:24.506 --> 22:27.503
because the german word for
poltergeist translates to "noisy ghost"

22:27.608 --> 22:30.100
but the germans and their words,
they've always been a little strange.

22:30.205 --> 22:31.701
Butterfly - schmetterling.

22:31.806 --> 22:34.302
- Pencil - kugelschreiber.
- On the subject, please.

22:34.408 --> 22:35.903
Right. Sorry.

22:36.007 --> 22:39.003
"noisy ghost" is a bit of a misnomer.

22:39.105 --> 22:43.201
Ok? A poltergeist is a supernatural
event caused by human agents.

22:43.306 --> 22:45.303
Like being able to move
things with your mind?

22:45.405 --> 22:47.102
Yes, and 9 times out of 10,

22:47.206 --> 22:49.703
that human agent is a girl
in the throes of puberty

22:49.808 --> 22:52.100
and/or going through horrible trauma.

22:52.207 --> 22:56.203
Well, her mom walked out on her.
I can't imagine anything more traumatic.

22:56.306 --> 22:57.103
Yeah.

22:57.207 --> 22:58.600
Ok, so how do I help her?

22:58.707 --> 23:01.402
Well, you have to get rid of the stress.
Then the poltergeist events will stop.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.601
Get her to talk about her mother.
Get her to open up,

23:03.708 --> 23:05.600
- talk about her feelings.
- Oh, that sounds too easy.

23:05.707 --> 23:07.203
It is. It is too easy.

23:07.306 --> 23:08.703
It's too easy, Melinda.
Don't try that.

23:08.807 --> 23:11.000
Let me complicate things.
Let me make it harder by running tests.

23:11.105 --> 23:13.901
- I'll get a kirlian camera.
- What? No cameras. No you.

23:14.005 --> 23:17.001
That's not fair, Melinda. You see
ghosts when you open your freezer

23:17.108 --> 23:19.803
dancing in the ice cube trays.
I need physical evidence.

23:19.905 --> 23:21.802
- Learn to deal.
- Ok, but you know what?

23:21.908 --> 23:25.002
This is gonna get worse and worse.
It's like a tub filling up with water,

23:25.107 --> 23:26.702
and that water's gonna
keep rising to the top

23:26.805 --> 23:28.603
until someone let's some of
the water out the drain.

23:28.705 --> 23:31.300
You're gonna have
a flood on your hands.

23:31.405 --> 23:33.203
Melinda...

23:33.306 --> 23:36.903
this thing you're doing for this girl...

23:37.007 --> 23:40.103
it's pretty great.

23:40.206 --> 23:42.802
Professor Payne,
are you getting soft on me?

23:42.905 --> 23:45.401
Are you kidding me?
I am schmetterling.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.303
Hear me roar.

23:53.008 --> 23:55.203
Ok. I think it's your turn.

23:55.305 --> 23:58.802
Your mom's really pretty.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.401
Why did you guys come back to Grandview?

24:01.505 --> 24:05.301
She wanted me to see my roots.

24:05.407 --> 24:07.703
Must have been rough
moving around so much.

24:07.805 --> 24:12.503
After a while, you just
kinda get used to it.

24:13.005 --> 24:16.603
You know, when i was
a little bit younger than you,

24:16.706 --> 24:20.003
my dad would leave us,
sometimes for months.

24:20.106 --> 24:22.703
"Business," my mom would say.

24:22.808 --> 24:25.700
And then one day,
he just never came back.

24:25.807 --> 24:28.203
And I would ask her why, you know.

24:28.306 --> 24:32.101
"Oh, it's business," she'd say.

24:32.207 --> 24:34.102
"He'll be back."

24:34.208 --> 24:37.900
Every time, no matter how much I asked,
she always had an answer,

24:38.005 --> 24:41.602
anything to keep me hoping.

24:41.805 --> 24:46.401
I think I always knew,
you know, deep down.

24:47.207 --> 24:49.601
Anyway,

24:49.705 --> 24:51.801
I think that you know things, too,

24:51.905 --> 24:54.903
Julie, deep down.

24:55.807 --> 24:58.101
Yeah.

24:59.006 --> 25:03.103
I mean, I always knew that
she was avoiding something

25:03.208 --> 25:05.102
or running from someone,

25:05.205 --> 25:07.401
but she never told me who.

25:07.508 --> 25:10.103
- Who do you think it was?
- I really don't know,

25:10.205 --> 25:12.902
but we changed names
every time we moved.

25:13.006 --> 25:14.603
Do you remember what the names were?

25:14.708 --> 25:18.500
Mom usually picked the name
of the street we last lived on,

25:18.607 --> 25:21.401
just to make it easier
for us to remember.

25:21.507 --> 25:26.402
There was Greentree, Fallon, Ovington,
you know.

25:29.208 --> 25:32.902
Melinda... help me find her.

25:34.505 --> 25:37.302
Nothing you did made her leave.

25:37.408 --> 25:40.200
It's not you.

25:53.705 --> 25:56.503
Great. Ok, curved fingers, right.

25:56.605 --> 25:59.600
Ok, don't forget.

25:59.705 --> 26:01.100
Julie.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.903
I am so happy to see you.

26:03.007 --> 26:04.803
Come here.

26:04.907 --> 26:07.001
It's good to see you, too.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.702
Ok, well, come on. Warm up.

26:08.807 --> 26:11.200
Ok, we'll pick up right where left off.

26:11.307 --> 26:13.103
Got a bunch of great new sheet music.

26:13.208 --> 26:17.501
Badly Drawn Boy, Rufus Wainwright,
Keane.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.101
I try to stay current.

26:19.207 --> 26:20.801
I find they stay with me
longer that way,

26:20.907 --> 26:24.703
and then as a bonus, my kids are
actually less embarrassed of me.

26:24.805 --> 26:27.302
Well, thanks for fitting us in.

26:27.405 --> 26:29.900
So you're Julie's foster mom?

26:30.007 --> 26:32.803
I mean, can I ask
what happened to Valerie?

26:32.905 --> 26:34.501
No one knows.

26:34.605 --> 26:35.603
Have you seen her?

26:35.707 --> 26:39.901
No. I was just surprised,
because she was such a doting mother.

26:40.006 --> 26:44.600
Has she ever spoken to you
about her father?

26:44.706 --> 26:46.903
Julie's a remarkable girl.

26:47.006 --> 26:50.800
She needs a good mother.
She deserves it.

26:50.906 --> 26:52.300
All right, Valerie Parker.

26:52.405 --> 26:54.502
She's got a few warrants
for unpaid parking tickets,

26:54.608 --> 26:57.401
bouncing checks, but nothing major
and nothing older than 6 months.

26:57.507 --> 26:59.901
And nothing from
the other cities she lived?

27:00.008 --> 27:03.503
Nope. No school records. No medical.
It's like she was born 6 months ago.

27:03.605 --> 27:07.000
But I did get a few hits
on a Valerie of a different name.

27:07.105 --> 27:09.003
On Ovington Ave. in '94.

27:09.106 --> 27:09.803
That's her.

27:09.906 --> 27:11.802
Valerie Ruttledge?

27:11.908 --> 27:13.900
Well, yes, I remember her.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.500
She lived here about 13 years ago.

27:15.607 --> 27:17.501
- That's right.
- Had a daughter.

27:17.608 --> 27:19.503
Are you going to ask me a question,

27:19.608 --> 27:22.103
or are you just gonna keep
telling me what I know?

27:22.208 --> 27:22.800
I'm sorry.

27:22.907 --> 27:25.402
I just wanted to get
some information on her.

27:25.505 --> 27:28.803
I'm the foster mother of her daughter.

27:28.906 --> 27:30.801
The hell you are.

27:30.906 --> 27:32.803
Excuse me?

27:32.905 --> 27:35.603
I was very close to Valerie.

27:35.706 --> 27:38.300
I saw her through that whole ordeal.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.300
What ordeal?

27:40.408 --> 27:42.603
When the baby died.

27:42.705 --> 27:45.502
Are you sure that you're not
confusing her with another tenant?

27:45.606 --> 27:47.800
I remember that last day I saw her.

27:47.905 --> 27:50.401
It was valentine's day,

27:50.506 --> 27:53.901
and I had talked her
into spending the day with me,

27:54.005 --> 27:55.902
because neither of us had a valentine,

27:56.005 --> 27:58.701
but she never showed up.

27:58.808 --> 28:01.300
Her daughter didn't die.
I was just with her this morning.

28:01.405 --> 28:04.403
I was there when val buried her.

28:04.507 --> 28:07.903
I was even there when she had
the operation the next month.

28:08.005 --> 28:09.101
What operation?

28:09.206 --> 28:11.001
The hysterectomy.

28:11.105 --> 28:15.500
Because of complications
with the delivery.

28:15.608 --> 28:18.902
That's what really wrecked her.

28:19.008 --> 28:21.300
She lost her child,

28:21.408 --> 28:23.403
she lost her husband,

28:23.507 --> 28:25.700
and she could never have another kid.

28:25.808 --> 28:31.301
You know, she put her name
on every kind of adoption list.

28:32.006 --> 28:33.500
And did she adopt?

28:33.608 --> 28:35.603
If she did,

28:35.706 --> 28:39.303
it was after she left here.

28:41.008 --> 28:43.800
You said Valerie left town
on Julie's birthday?

28:43.905 --> 28:47.603
Right, which may mean that Julie
was born that day in another town

28:47.705 --> 28:51.000
- and Valerie went to adopt her.
- Why changes names in every town?

28:51.106 --> 28:52.101
I don't know.

28:52.208 --> 28:58.402
I have to talk to Julie again.
She has to know more than she realizes.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.203
Come on.

29:18.007 --> 29:20.401
You ok?

29:53.105 --> 29:56.102
Have you ever seen an aura?

29:56.207 --> 29:59.500
Ok, Melinda, tell me
about your first time.

29:59.606 --> 30:01.803
On kirlian camera, Jim.

30:01.906 --> 30:03.401
I would never ask her that...

30:03.508 --> 30:04.200
with you home.

30:04.306 --> 30:05.900
Ok, come take a look at this.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.501
It's really just gas ionization
of moisture molecules

30:08.608 --> 30:12.101
around a living organism,
but it's still pretty cool, huh?

30:12.208 --> 30:14.302
So the cloud that I saw,
that was an aura?

30:14.405 --> 30:16.800
No. Auras are sweet and pretty.

30:16.908 --> 30:18.500
What you saw was not.

30:18.607 --> 30:20.901
What you saw was an ectoplasm.

30:21.006 --> 30:24.502
It's a form of bioenergy.
Jim, that's not a shopping cart.

30:24.608 --> 30:26.102
It's a byproduct of psychic phenomena,

30:26.206 --> 30:28.900
sort of like the snot of
a psychic cold virus.

30:29.006 --> 30:30.303
Nice.

30:30.407 --> 30:31.601
Whatever it is, it's probably telling us

30:31.706 --> 30:33.901
that this is escalating
to very dangerous levels.

30:34.007 --> 30:36.603
So why did it disappear
the minute that we walked in?

30:36.705 --> 30:40.502
That's an excellent question,
Melinda Gordon, really.

30:40.608 --> 30:42.300
Well?

30:42.405 --> 30:44.803
No, I don't have an answer.
That's why it's an excellent question.

30:44.906 --> 30:46.301
What is all this stuff?

30:46.405 --> 30:48.002
Oh, jim, you're so naive.
It's adorable.

30:48.108 --> 30:49.801
It's the candy store
for the parapsychologist.

30:49.907 --> 30:53.600
Cameras, microphones to record
paranormal activity.

30:53.708 --> 30:57.003
You have the electromagnotometer
to record electromagnetic energy,

30:57.108 --> 31:00.601
and of course there's the old,
reliable neurofeedback machine

31:00.708 --> 31:03.401
to monitor synaptic activity.

31:03.508 --> 31:05.800
And there's the mp3 player
so I can listen to Motley Crue.

31:05.907 --> 31:09.001
Just 'cause I'm a professor
doesn't mean I don't like to rock out.

31:09.106 --> 31:10.600
How is all this gonna help?

31:10.707 --> 31:13.700
We can monitor the girl's
brain activity with this machine,

31:13.805 --> 31:17.802
and then we can see the hot spots
in her head when she has a poltergeist

31:17.905 --> 31:20.301
event going on. Then we treat her.

31:20.408 --> 31:23.800
Look, I didn't even tell Julie
about this, so what if she says no?

31:23.908 --> 31:28.701
If this guy can figure out
what's wrong with me...

31:28.806 --> 31:31.401
I'm ready.

31:40.705 --> 31:42.402
You said it happens
when she gets emotional,

31:42.507 --> 31:44.801
so why don't you just sit in the seat,
and you can have the honors?

31:44.906 --> 31:46.300
Don't you think
she's been through enough?

31:46.408 --> 31:48.200
It's the only way I can map out
activity in her brain

31:48.308 --> 31:53.502
if we have a poltergeist,
so let's have a poltergeist.

31:56.207 --> 31:58.801
Ok, Julie,

31:59.208 --> 32:01.602
when did these things
start happening to you?

32:01.707 --> 32:03.702
About 2 months ago.

32:03.805 --> 32:05.901
It started in my first foster home.

32:06.008 --> 32:10.700
And is there a certain time
that they happen, like a situation?

32:10.805 --> 32:15.803
It happens to anyone
that starts to care about me.

32:16.006 --> 32:19.303
Ok, let's... you know?

32:21.406 --> 32:24.600
Do you know where you were really born?

32:24.708 --> 32:27.600
What? What are you talking about?
I was born in Grandview.

32:27.706 --> 32:29.502
There is no record of that.

32:29.605 --> 32:34.100
No. Why would my mom
lie to me about that?

32:37.508 --> 32:41.001
She's been lying about a lot of things.

32:41.105 --> 32:44.703
No. My mother gave me
everything I ever needed.

32:44.806 --> 32:48.803
I don't care about anything else.

32:51.805 --> 32:55.300
Melinda, what's going on?

32:58.105 --> 33:01.103
Oh, my. I see it.

33:01.608 --> 33:04.103
Finally.

33:04.807 --> 33:07.601
Do you see it?

33:08.506 --> 33:09.602
See what?

33:09.708 --> 33:11.001
Doesn't want me to see it.

33:11.106 --> 33:12.903
Look, who are you?
What do you want?

33:13.005 --> 33:14.202
What's happening?

33:14.306 --> 33:16.500
- Take her back.
- Take her back?

33:16.607 --> 33:17.102
What does that mean?

33:17.206 --> 33:20.901
What's going on?
Who are you talking to?

33:21.006 --> 33:23.502
I came to take her back.

33:23.605 --> 33:26.700
- Valerie.
- What?

33:26.805 --> 33:28.701
Why are you talking about my mom?

33:28.805 --> 33:31.402
What is going on?

33:31.505 --> 33:33.402
She can't know.

33:33.505 --> 33:36.701
Ok, I can't do this.
I need to know!

33:36.806 --> 33:41.402
What's going on?!
I need to know what's going on!

33:41.506 --> 33:44.400
It's all right.

33:52.308 --> 33:53.601
How's she doing in there?

33:53.708 --> 33:55.600
She won't let me in her room.

33:55.707 --> 33:58.302
Jim's still trying.

33:58.405 --> 34:00.903
Look, I might've been slightly wrong.
It looks like we have a ghost.

34:01.008 --> 34:04.200
Slightly wrong as in slightly dead
or slightly pregnant?

34:04.305 --> 34:06.202
I thought you told me
that her mother was alive.

34:06.305 --> 34:09.203
Well, that's what Wheeler said,
that she was cashing checks.

34:09.306 --> 34:11.000
Maybe the payments on that account
are automated.

34:11.107 --> 34:12.801
They don't stop unless you stop them.

34:12.907 --> 34:15.003
"Take her back,"

34:15.106 --> 34:16.402
what does that mean?

34:16.505 --> 34:19.002
Take her back into the afterlife?
Does she wanna kill her?

34:19.106 --> 34:22.100
No, that can't be it.
She wasn't hurting her, you know.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.001
She was just trying to keep us
from getting to her.

34:24.108 --> 34:26.199
In fact, she never hurt her.

34:26.306 --> 34:28.600
Maybe she doesn't want Julie
to have a new family.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.199
- Why?
- I don't know.

34:30.306 --> 34:32.603
She's a mom, can't let go.

34:32.706 --> 34:34.900
That's creepy.

34:35.007 --> 34:37.902
"Take her back."

34:38.007 --> 34:40.503
Take her back where?

34:40.608 --> 34:41.400
Home?

34:41.505 --> 34:47.101
There's nothing there for her.
There's no family. There's...

34:59.207 --> 35:01.403
It all makes sense.

35:01.505 --> 35:06.003
The changing of names,
constant running, no records.

35:06.107 --> 35:09.700
February 14 isn't Julie's birthday.

35:09.806 --> 35:13.701
It's the day she was kidnapped.

35:14.208 --> 35:16.702
But why bring Julie back to the town
where she was stolen?

35:16.808 --> 35:19.900
To take her back...

35:20.507 --> 35:23.601
to her real mother.

35:25.406 --> 35:28.102
She's here.

35:29.205 --> 35:33.503
I loved her like she was my own.
You have to believe me.

35:33.605 --> 35:37.501
You stole someone else's child.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.600
She's not gonna talk to me
while you guys are there.

35:44.705 --> 35:46.903
Ok.

35:48.207 --> 35:53.301
It was wrong,
but I just couldn't
undo it. I loved her too much.

35:53.407 --> 35:55.502
Why did you bring her back here?

35:55.607 --> 35:57.901
Sick.

35:59.008 --> 36:02.000
I was real sick.

36:04.007 --> 36:05.803
I had a blood clot in my brain.

36:05.908 --> 36:08.503
I know I deserved it.

36:08.606 --> 36:12.701
I had to give her back before I died.

36:12.808 --> 36:14.600
But you died first.

36:14.708 --> 36:18.502
It wasn't supposed to happen so soon.

36:18.607 --> 36:20.900
An aneurism.

36:21.007 --> 36:24.601
And I just slipped into the lake.

36:24.706 --> 36:26.802
My body's still there.

36:26.906 --> 36:29.102
Valerie, you have to
tell her the truth.

36:29.205 --> 36:32.503
No. I can't.
She can't know.

36:32.608 --> 36:35.800
She doesn't know where you are, and
she still has hope that you're alive.

36:35.907 --> 36:38.603
No, I won't.

36:38.807 --> 36:42.401
If you don't, then I will.

36:45.005 --> 36:47.203
No!

36:51.806 --> 36:54.001
Jim!

37:03.206 --> 37:06.602
It's time for the truth.

37:08.505 --> 37:12.203
So she didn't just leave me?

37:13.306 --> 37:15.100
She didn't just get tired of me?

37:15.205 --> 37:17.100
No.

37:17.205 --> 37:20.503
No, leaving you is the last thing
she wanted to do.

37:20.608 --> 37:23.103
Your mother was just trying
to do something good for you.

37:23.207 --> 37:26.202
That's why she brought you back here.

37:26.305 --> 37:30.501
She just died before she could do it.

37:35.207 --> 37:38.200
How do you know all of this?

37:38.305 --> 37:41.301
Julie, your mom died, but she...

37:41.408 --> 37:44.602
she stayed with you.

37:45.807 --> 37:48.003
Her spirit,

37:48.105 --> 37:51.001
she's been protecting you.

37:51.106 --> 37:54.903
She's the reason all these
weird things have been happening.

37:55.005 --> 37:57.301
What?

38:00.007 --> 38:03.501
My mother has been doing all this to me?

38:03.605 --> 38:05.401
No, please!

38:05.508 --> 38:08.603
I don't want her to hate me.
Let me tell her the rest.

38:08.708 --> 38:10.502
Julie, your mom is here with us,

38:10.607 --> 38:12.300
and there's some things
that she wants you to know.

38:12.406 --> 38:17.302
She's gonna tell me,
and then I'll tell you, ok?

38:17.706 --> 38:20.003
She's gonna think I'm a monster.

38:20.107 --> 38:24.003
You have to tell her the truth.

38:26.408 --> 38:28.301
I just wanted a child so badly.

38:28.407 --> 38:32.002
I had so much love to give.

38:34.305 --> 38:38.803
My baby died, and I could
never have another one.

38:38.905 --> 38:43.101
And all I could think of was,
"why her?"

38:43.206 --> 38:47.000
"Why does she get to have 3 healthy
children, and I get none?"

38:47.107 --> 38:49.602
I was a good person.

38:49.707 --> 38:52.501
I didn't do anything wrong,

38:52.607 --> 38:58.000
and all that I cared for in
this world got taken from me.

39:01.106 --> 39:06.102
I just wanted someone to love
and to take care of.

39:10.206 --> 39:12.903
She took me?

39:13.807 --> 39:17.302
She's not my real mother?

39:18.007 --> 39:20.302
I don't deserve forgiveness,

39:20.407 --> 39:23.803
but, honey, you deserve a mother.

39:23.908 --> 39:25.503
How could you do that?

39:25.608 --> 39:27.502
She is so sorry.

39:27.607 --> 39:31.802
Julie, she knows that she was wrong.

39:32.008 --> 39:36.301
And do you know who my real mother is?

39:38.608 --> 39:41.300
Who is she?

39:41.407 --> 39:44.001
Come here.

39:54.408 --> 39:57.802
Hi. I was here with Julie
a few days ago.

39:57.907 --> 39:59.600
Of course. Hi.

39:59.707 --> 40:01.402
What can I do for you?

40:01.506 --> 40:04.501
I know that you lost your daughter
13 years ago.

40:04.605 --> 40:07.403
She was taken from you.
Is that right?

40:07.508 --> 40:09.000
Yes.

40:09.107 --> 40:11.901
Why are you asking?

40:12.005 --> 40:15.602
Your daughter's been found.

40:15.905 --> 40:18.203
What?

40:20.206 --> 40:22.501
I mean, are you sure?

40:22.608 --> 40:25.103
I mean, 'cause the police gave up.

40:25.206 --> 40:28.603
Everyone gave up.
Everyone but me, of course.

40:28.705 --> 40:32.602
Well, you can stop looking now.

41:26.007 --> 41:29.802
Do you think she'll ever
be able to forgive me?

41:29.906 --> 41:33.403
That's for her to decide.

41:36.307 --> 41:38.701
That light, that can't be for me.

41:38.805 --> 41:40.101
It is.

41:40.205 --> 41:41.503
You're ready to go.

41:41.608 --> 41:45.503
No, I'm ashamed to go.
I don't deserve that light.

41:45.606 --> 41:51.801
Look, I don't know what's over there,
but I don't think it's judgment.

41:53.206 --> 41:55.500
What?

41:56.206 --> 41:59.400
That's my baby girl.

42:53.205 --> 42:55.202
The state released Julie
into Heather's custody.

42:55.306 --> 42:59.900
She has a brother and sister
to get to know.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.503
What?

43:04.607 --> 43:06.001
I don't know.
It's just...

43:06.107 --> 43:08.302
I think I'll miss her a little bit.

43:08.408 --> 43:10.800
Be weird to see that room empty.

43:10.906 --> 43:15.502
Well, maybe the room
won't be empty forever.

43:16.308 --> 43:17.401
Hey, and you know what?

43:17.505 --> 43:20.502
We've always got Homer,
even though he won't come inside.

43:20.605 --> 43:21.901
Man's dead best friend.

43:22.007 --> 43:26.401
Know what? Maybe he's just here
to watch over us? A watchdog?

43:26.508 --> 43:28.601
Yeah. If I was a burglar,
I think I would avoid the house

43:28.706 --> 43:31.803
with the invisible dog
that can't bite me.

43:31.908 --> 43:32.900
You know what?

43:33.008 --> 43:35.601
Do you know if we have any of those
meringue cookies left?

43:35.705 --> 43:40.502
Are you planning a midnight
refrigerator raid?

43:47.807 --> 43:52.002
