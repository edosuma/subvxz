00:08.007 --> 00:09.341
Hm-hmm.

00:09.410 --> 00:10.943
Listen, guys, about the plan...

00:11.011 --> 00:11.943
Sal, look.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.380
Doughnuts?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.381
Yup.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.982
Cops love doughnuts.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.684
Dude, I think that's only in the movies.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.018
Let me tell you something, Sal.

00:20.087 --> 00:22.121
Movie cops, real cops...

00:22.189 --> 00:23.956
they all have one thing in common.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.124
They like doughnuts.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.326
No.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.727
They love doughnuts.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.262
I love doughnuts too.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.730
Maybe I should become a cop one day.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.065
Okay.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.166
So, we all set?

00:34.235 --> 00:35.167
Yes.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.902
Everyone good with the "plan"?

00:36.971 --> 00:38.370
Ready.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.738
Wait, what's the plan again?

00:42.943 --> 00:44.977
The plan is to ask Daniel to his face

00:45.045 --> 00:46.345
about working with the mole.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.380
I still can't believe
Daniel's working with Diane.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.082
Without even telling us.

00:50.151 --> 00:53.051
Tess, I have to ask this one more time.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.988
You're sure you saw
Daniel and Diane together?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.856
Look, I am just as shocked as you are.

00:57.925 --> 01:00.225
Wait, are we sure Diane's the mole?

01:00.294 --> 01:01.493
How could she not be?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.495
I saw her handing over
the green mask to Daniel.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.263
Well, okay then.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.532
Let's confront Daniel then.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.068
Not... not physically.

01:10.137 --> 01:12.404
Just let's just...
let's just talk to him.

01:12.473 --> 01:14.106
Because, um, he's pretty...

01:14.175 --> 01:15.107
he's pretty ripped.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.478
There's nothing better than
a sugary sweet showdown.

01:26.020 --> 01:27.553
Oh, you guys, you're all here.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.391
You brought doughnuts?

01:32.460 --> 01:33.826
Nice.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.861
Everyone at the station loves doughnuts.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.363
Sal says cops only like
doughnuts in the movies.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.565
Oh, that's not true.

01:39.633 --> 01:40.732
They really love them.

01:40.801 --> 01:41.834
Not me, of course.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.735
I gotta watch the calories.

01:46.507 --> 01:47.906
They do look good, though.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.076
Gotta stay disciplined.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.645
Ooh... doughnuts.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.148
Did you guys bring these in for us?

01:56.217 --> 01:57.916
That's so nice of you.

01:59.487 --> 02:01.053
How did you know we all love doughnuts?

02:01.121 --> 02:02.154
Well, Daniel deserves it

02:02.223 --> 02:03.322
since we tell him everything

02:03.390 --> 02:05.257
and he tells us everything.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.558
Right, Daniel?

02:06.627 --> 02:09.595
Well, yeah, he's very lucky to
have such a sweet, warm,

02:09.663 --> 02:11.129
tight-knit family.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.130
Mmm.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.165
Thanks for the doughnuts, guys.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.610 --> 02:24.276
So, Daniel...

02:24.345 --> 02:25.911
how's the doughnut taste?

02:25.980 --> 02:28.013
Does it taste like sugary sweet guilt?

02:28.082 --> 02:29.281
What?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.216
Would you say it tastes better than...

02:31.285 --> 02:34.887
say, hmm, eating at a fancy restaurant?

02:37.558 --> 02:38.557
You guys followed me?

02:38.626 --> 02:39.892
No, we followed the mole rat.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.160
Mole rat?

02:42.229 --> 02:43.161
She means the mole.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.997
We were following Diane.

02:45.065 --> 02:46.865
You... are working with the enemy.

02:49.136 --> 02:50.536
Where were you
the night of yesterday night?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.740
I mean...

02:54.808 --> 02:55.941
do you have an "a-bye-lie"?

02:57.044 --> 02:58.243
You mean alibi?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.846
Don't play word games with me, mister.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.915
Okay, enough of
the bad cop/bad cop routine.

03:04.251 --> 03:05.617
We were following Diane.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.052
Daniel, what is going on?

03:09.256 --> 03:10.522
I can't tell you guys.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.523
I really can't.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.225
I'm taken off the case.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.359
Are you working with the mole?

03:16.463 --> 03:17.429
All right.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.932
Fine, I'll... I'll tell you guys.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.567
Just not here.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.568
Follow me.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.375
I'm just walking them out.

03:37.751 --> 03:38.884
You guys...

03:44.992 --> 03:47.893
This... is the mask
they used to frame Erik.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.903
It's a polypropylene polymer mask.

03:57.972 --> 03:59.237
Right.

03:59.306 --> 04:00.839
So they must have painted
Erik's face onto the mask.

04:02.509 --> 04:03.609
What?

04:03.677 --> 04:05.043
That's how my favorite
superhero was made.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.044
Starface.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.246
Exactly.

04:08.315 --> 04:10.015
But why did Diane give it to you?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.850
She wanted to help us.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.018
She used her connections

04:13.087 --> 04:14.820
and actually went really out of her way

04:14.888 --> 04:16.622
to get a hold of this piece of evidence.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.923
Trust me, she is not the enemy.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.492
And neither am I.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.627
But how do we know we can trust you

04:21.695 --> 04:23.261
if you don't tell us everything?

04:23.330 --> 04:24.730
Look, it's hard enough
to manage this whole

04:24.798 --> 04:27.065
cop/son/brother thing, okay?

04:27.134 --> 04:28.367
I'm sorry if I get it wrong sometimes.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.269
Anyway, Simon,

04:31.338 --> 04:32.804
he didn't want anything
to do with the mask.

04:34.775 --> 04:35.707
Daniel?

04:40.514 --> 04:41.446
What's taking so long?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.371
Uh, uh, nothing.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.273
I was just talking to
my brothers and sisters.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.274
Nothing is good.

05:10.778 --> 05:11.710
Of course, I'm counting on the fact

05:11.779 --> 05:13.679
that you are not working on the case,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.313
because, if you were,

05:15.382 --> 05:16.314
you would know there will be some

05:16.383 --> 05:18.116
unfortunate consequences.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.918
Hey, did you have a doughnut?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.053
No.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.021
Good, 'cause they're
only meant for nice cops.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.022
Anika!

05:26.026 --> 05:27.859
They were just leaving.

05:27.928 --> 05:28.894
Good.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.195
Bye, Daniel.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.196
Bye, Danny.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.197
Bye, guys.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.679
One down... three to go.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.848
Are we sure she isn't the mole?

05:49.917 --> 05:52.718
If Daniel vouches for her,
then we'll have to trust her.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.753
Besides, she gave us our next clue.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.754
Hey, guys!

05:59.793 --> 06:01.727
Hey, how are you kids doing?

06:01.795 --> 06:03.895
- Hey...
- Hey...

06:03.964 --> 06:05.197
Anika?

06:05.265 --> 06:06.531
Oh, oh.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.034
Anika's just feeling sad

06:09.103 --> 06:10.402
because, uh...

06:10.471 --> 06:12.104
There's... there's no doughnuts left.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.305
Yeah, right, doughnuts.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.339
What?

06:14.408 --> 06:15.907
There were doughnuts?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.375
And nobody told me?

06:18.579 --> 06:20.378
I'll pick some up later from the store.

06:20.447 --> 06:21.880
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.815
She really loves doughnuts.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.784
I do, I do really love them.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.319
Yeah, me too.

06:27.387 --> 06:28.754
Well, I'll leave you kids alone.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.856
Bye.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.293
That...

06:35.362 --> 06:37.095
was some quick thinking, Jake.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.296
Mm-hmm.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.499
Now I am sad that there
aren't any doughnuts left.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.069
All right, well, what's the next
step of the plan?

06:45.806 --> 06:47.239
Okay.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.174
Well...

06:49.243 --> 06:51.376
the mask might be able to assist

06:51.445 --> 06:53.044
the facial-recognition software

06:53.113 --> 06:54.279
by cancelling out

06:54.348 --> 06:56.381
the dimensions of the polymer.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.083
There's a chance we can get

06:58.152 --> 07:00.552
a positive identification through that.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.053
But...

07:02.122 --> 07:05.223
that would require
a ton of computing power,

07:05.292 --> 07:07.759
and even if I'm able to fix my laptop,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.461
I don't think my system can handle it.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.698
And we need to figure out
where this mask came from.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.900
Already a step ahead of you.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.501
I narrowed it down to

07:16.570 --> 07:18.703
five possible locations in Amsterdam.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.704
Great, I'll check out the stores.

07:19.773 --> 07:20.705
I'm coming with.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.975
You've got a new message from Apollo.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.847
The location of the
correct store is Canal Street 4.

07:28.916 --> 07:30.348
Apoll0?

07:30.417 --> 07:32.083
Who's Apoll0?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.318
I met him online.

07:33.387 --> 07:35.487
Sal, do you even know this person?

07:35.556 --> 07:37.522
No, but he's...

07:37.591 --> 07:38.523
Or she.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.761
...or she has been
really helping me out.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.564
But why is this person helping you out?

07:45.632 --> 07:47.732
He or "she" could be dangerous.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.934
I don't think so.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.635
It was Apoll0 who got the power back on

07:50.704 --> 07:52.103
when you guys were following Diane.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.007
How do you know you can trust him?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.209
Or her.

07:57.277 --> 07:58.376
Or her.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.445
Sorry, Anika.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.480
I... I don't.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.783
We don't have time for this.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.085
Jake and I will go check out the store.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.588
Anika and you find out if
we can trust this Apoll0.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.056
- Deal?
- Deal.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.057
All right.

08:25.806 --> 08:26.738
This is awesome.

08:32.913 --> 08:33.845
Bingo!

08:37.717 --> 08:39.551
Looks like we came to the right place.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.684
Now let's see who bought it.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.790
You can't just leave
me in the dark like that.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.659
These kids are counting on you!

08:47.728 --> 08:48.693
You know what?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.228
Ahh... okay.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.429
No, good luck to you.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.598
Customers?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.066
I can't have customers right now.

08:55.135 --> 08:57.035
Well, we don't wanna buy anything.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.169
We just have some questions.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.605
Didn't you read the sign on the door?

09:00.674 --> 09:01.840
See?

09:01.909 --> 09:02.941
Closed.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.745
But from outside it says "open."

09:06.813 --> 09:07.779
Yes, but you, my dear,

09:07.848 --> 09:09.481
are on the inside of the store,

09:09.549 --> 09:11.016
so we're closed.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.018
I'm sorry, but can I ask you to leave?

09:13.086 --> 09:14.286
Oh, come on, it'll take, like, a second.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.553
I don't have a second.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.390
I don't even have
whatever is left of a second.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.859
I have to entertain
an entire birthday party

09:20.928 --> 09:22.260
and the face painter and storyteller

09:22.329 --> 09:23.595
both called in sick.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.796
Look...

09:24.865 --> 09:26.932
all we wanna know is
who bought this mask?

09:27.000 --> 09:28.400
Do you have security cameras here?

09:28.468 --> 09:29.501
Cameras?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.904
Oh, I would never
impede people's privacy.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.840
Besides, I have an excellent memory.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.709
So, would you remember
what the person looked like?

09:37.778 --> 09:38.777
I don't have time for this.

09:38.845 --> 09:39.978
You both have to go.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.079
Please.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.580
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
- We just wanna...

09:42.649 --> 09:43.581
Go, go, go, go, go, go...

09:46.787 --> 09:47.886
Apoll0, are you there?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.020
Of course.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.689
I can help you get the identity

09:50.757 --> 09:52.991
of the real robber who framed Erik.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.694
But I need to have full
access to your computer.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.596
How do we know we can trust you?

09:58.665 --> 09:59.898
You don't.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.866
But I understand your suspicion.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.002
That's why I made
a special cloud network

10:04.071 --> 10:06.972
where I dropped some files
to fix your computer

10:07.040 --> 10:08.406
and secure it.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.208
I protected it with a password

10:10.277 --> 10:12.377
only you guys can figure out.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.045
How will we know the password?

10:14.114 --> 10:16.815
You will understand once you see it.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.183
I don't get it.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.384
Check the screen.

10:22.456 --> 10:23.788
Oh, it's a riddle box.

10:29.946 --> 10:31.446
Oh, it's a riddle box.

10:31.515 --> 10:33.982
Those are the riddles
and the answers are numbers.

10:35.619 --> 10:37.952
So to get the combination
to Apoll0's cloud,

10:38.021 --> 10:39.454
we have to answer those riddles

10:39.523 --> 10:41.389
before that timer hits zero.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.725
Can't we just try
all the number combinations?

10:43.794 --> 10:45.894
We'll start with 000.

10:45.962 --> 10:47.696
Why 000?

10:47.764 --> 10:49.531
Because it's a good place to start.

10:49.599 --> 10:51.433
And they look like doughnuts.

10:51.501 --> 10:53.768
Are you two still
thinking about doughnuts?

10:53.837 --> 10:56.237
Hey, I, for one,

10:56.306 --> 10:58.640
am very sad I didn't
have any this morning.

10:58.709 --> 10:59.774
Me too.

10:59.843 --> 11:02.343
Okay, well, it can't be
as simple as 000.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.545
This is a riddle box.

11:03.613 --> 11:06.114
Like, only super-smart
people can solve these.

11:06.183 --> 11:07.849
Okay, first riddle.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.018
"How many Apollo astronauts have touched

11:10.087 --> 11:12.087
the moon with their feet?"

11:12.155 --> 11:14.222
Huh, this is a hard one.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.390
Okay.

11:15.459 --> 11:16.991
"How many Apollo astronauts have touched

11:17.060 --> 11:17.992
the moon with their feet?"

11:19.229 --> 11:21.896
The Apollo space program
had 12 astronauts...

11:24.901 --> 11:25.834
Okay, let's try again.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.579
Excuse me.

11:37.647 --> 11:39.447
Didn't I lock the door?

11:39.516 --> 11:41.883
Uh... no, you didn't.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.518
Oh, yeah, that's right, I...

11:43.587 --> 11:45.553
- We have an offer for you.
- Yeah.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.522
See, I happen to be really
good at face painting

11:47.591 --> 11:49.691
and she happens to be
really good at story telling.

11:49.760 --> 11:50.992
So maybe we can help you out.

11:51.061 --> 11:52.494
That would be fantastic!

11:52.562 --> 11:54.662
But, in return,

11:54.731 --> 11:56.097
you'll take the time to think about

11:56.166 --> 11:57.098
who bought that mask.

11:58.201 --> 11:59.134
Yeah.

11:59.202 --> 12:00.368
Yeah, I will.

12:00.437 --> 12:02.036
I promise, I swear,
I'll tell you everything.

12:02.105 --> 12:03.605
But right now we gotta go.

12:04.708 --> 12:05.907
My name is Yoot, by the way.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.142
- Tess.
- Jake.

12:07.210 --> 12:08.510
Ah, Jess and Take.

12:08.578 --> 12:09.644
Nice to meet you.

12:09.713 --> 12:10.645
Take.

12:10.714 --> 12:11.646
That's a weird name.

12:11.715 --> 12:12.747
But anyway, we gotta go.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.982
We gotta get out of here.

12:14.050 --> 12:15.116
We gotta go to this party.

12:17.854 --> 12:20.054
Can you imagine that,
walking on the moon?

12:20.123 --> 12:21.823
There isn't a lot of gravity there,

12:21.892 --> 12:23.525
so you would have to walk around

12:23.593 --> 12:24.826
like a space princess.

12:24.895 --> 12:27.428
I'm a space dancer!

12:27.497 --> 12:28.830
Okay, 12.

12:28.899 --> 12:30.265
That's one and two.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.866
Add those together, that's three.

12:31.935 --> 12:32.867
So three... nailed it!

12:32.936 --> 12:33.868
What's next?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.641
"How many steps does it take

12:39.709 --> 12:41.643
"to go from one end of the Apollo cable

12:41.711 --> 12:42.777
to the other?"

12:42.846 --> 12:44.145
Apollo cable?

12:44.214 --> 12:45.647
The Apollo cable is a cable

12:45.715 --> 12:47.382
connecting America to Europe.

12:47.450 --> 12:49.450
It goes over the bottom of
the Atlantic Ocean,

12:49.519 --> 12:50.518
all the way across.

12:50.587 --> 12:52.253
It's really big... incredibly huge.

12:52.322 --> 12:53.254
It's really incredible...

12:53.323 --> 12:56.124
Yeah, but how many steps does it take?

12:56.193 --> 12:57.826
Only one way to find out.

12:57.894 --> 12:59.060
I'll go get some rope.

13:07.137 --> 13:09.337
So... how do I look?

13:11.741 --> 13:14.843
Uh, you look terrific, Yoot.

13:14.911 --> 13:17.045
Ooh, I'm no longer Yoot.

13:17.113 --> 13:18.813
I'm Clowny the Clown Clown!

13:20.050 --> 13:21.282
Clowny the Clown Clown?

13:21.351 --> 13:22.717
Great name, huh?

13:22.786 --> 13:24.252
I guess.

13:24.321 --> 13:25.954
It used to be Yupe the You Cube

13:26.022 --> 13:27.856
but that didn't quite take off.

13:27.924 --> 13:30.692
Anyway, Jess, you're the face painter,

13:30.760 --> 13:33.728
and, Take, you're the storyteller.

13:33.797 --> 13:35.663
It's actually the other way around.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.899
Jess, you don't look like a storyteller.

13:37.968 --> 13:38.933
Take does.

13:39.002 --> 13:41.402
Trust me, I'm a professional.

13:41.471 --> 13:42.537
Hey, kids!

13:42.606 --> 13:43.972
I'm Clowny the Clown Clown!

13:45.041 --> 13:46.307
Yay!

13:46.376 --> 13:48.443
And this is my big friend Take.

13:48.511 --> 13:49.444
He's a...

13:51.882 --> 13:53.548
Storyteller.

13:53.617 --> 13:55.049
Anyone wanna hear a story?

13:55.118 --> 13:57.051
Yay!

13:57.120 --> 13:59.587
And this is my other big friend Jess.

13:59.656 --> 14:01.122
She's a...

14:01.191 --> 14:02.957
Face painter.

14:03.026 --> 14:04.926
Who wants to get their face painted?

14:04.995 --> 14:06.594
Yay!

14:06.663 --> 14:09.264
Well, let's get this party started!

14:09.332 --> 14:11.799
Yay!

14:13.003 --> 14:14.068
Yay!

14:19.843 --> 14:22.110
Can you make me a dragon?

14:22.178 --> 14:23.344
Oh...

14:23.413 --> 14:24.913
Hey.

14:24.981 --> 14:26.047
Um...

14:30.053 --> 14:31.185
Oh boy.

14:31.254 --> 14:33.354
Uh... hi, kids.

14:38.495 --> 14:40.295
Well, uh, I'm... I'm Take.

14:40.363 --> 14:41.296
Well, that's not actually...

14:42.399 --> 14:43.364
Never mind.

14:43.433 --> 14:44.499
Uh, storyteller.

14:44.567 --> 14:45.633
Yeah, okay.

14:51.608 --> 14:53.107
Okay.

14:53.176 --> 14:54.242
How many steps?

14:55.745 --> 14:58.913
The Apollo cable is 13,000 kilometers.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.482
The average human step
is 50 centimeters.

15:06.790 --> 15:07.722
Got it!

15:09.125 --> 15:11.693
Okay, so I calculated
the length of the Apollo cable

15:11.761 --> 15:14.562
divided by the average human step.

15:14.631 --> 15:16.864
The answer's 13-million-800-and...

15:16.933 --> 15:19.267
Sal, it only let's you
put in three digits.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.301
I know.

15:20.370 --> 15:23.771
So we just take the cube root of that

15:23.840 --> 15:25.239
and the answer is... eight.

15:25.308 --> 15:26.708
Ha-ha, yes!

15:26.776 --> 15:28.643
Uh, Sal, we're running out of time.

15:28.712 --> 15:29.811
We only have one minute left.

15:29.879 --> 15:31.279
Okay, Apoll0, bring it on.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.580
What's the final riddle?

15:32.649 --> 15:34.983
"I am Apollo, Greek god of poetry.

15:35.051 --> 15:37.085
How many poems have I written?"

15:37.153 --> 15:38.086
This is a tough one.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.288
I wish Tess was here.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.289
She'd know what to do.

15:45.095 --> 15:46.461
15 seconds left.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.696
Apollo wrote poems, Apollo wrote...

15:50.633 --> 15:52.734
Zero, zero, zero.

15:56.239 --> 15:57.171
Yay, Anika!

15:57.240 --> 15:58.606
You solved it!

15:58.675 --> 15:59.674
What? How?

15:59.743 --> 16:00.742
How...

16:04.981 --> 16:07.482
Hey, kids, wanna make balloon animals?

16:07.550 --> 16:08.583
Yay!

16:08.651 --> 16:09.584
Follow me!

16:11.654 --> 16:13.287
Am I a dragon yet?

16:13.356 --> 16:14.288
Um...

16:16.159 --> 16:17.325
You know what?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.893
What if I tweak your idea a bit,

16:18.962 --> 16:19.994
make it even cooler?

16:20.063 --> 16:21.095
Sure.

16:21.164 --> 16:22.330
What if I give you

16:22.399 --> 16:24.899
a good old-fashioned detective mustache?

16:24.968 --> 16:27.201
Then you'd be a detective dragon.

16:27.270 --> 16:29.303
A detective dragon.

16:29.372 --> 16:31.005
Yeah.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.106
Yeah!

16:32.175 --> 16:34.842
And then the princess broke the chain.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.177
Clang!

16:36.246 --> 16:37.178
"Enough!

16:37.247 --> 16:39.113
I want to be a superhero!"

16:40.550 --> 16:44.018
And then she flew out of the castle.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.286
Whoosh!

16:45.355 --> 16:47.922
Roar, I'm a detective dragon.

16:47.991 --> 16:49.791
Now go solve some mystery
while being a dragon.

16:51.795 --> 16:53.694
Can I be a detective dragon too?

16:53.763 --> 16:55.430
Absolutely.

16:55.498 --> 16:59.634
And then... the superhero
princess closed her eyes

16:59.702 --> 17:01.169
and went to sleep.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.838
And she thought of all
the very cool things

17:03.907 --> 17:05.540
that happened to her.

17:05.608 --> 17:06.674
The end.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.176
Ah, yes, thank you.

17:17.020 --> 17:18.752
You... you two must be geniuses!

17:18.821 --> 17:20.755
Zero, zero, zero.

17:21.825 --> 17:23.458
Zero, zero, zero?

17:23.526 --> 17:26.194
Three tiny doughnuts.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.295
That doesn't make any sense.

17:27.363 --> 17:29.030
How many Apollo astronauts have touched

17:29.099 --> 17:30.231
the moon with their feet?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.232
Zero.

17:32.302 --> 17:33.367
Because they wore boots.

17:33.436 --> 17:34.469
So they never actually

17:34.537 --> 17:36.504
touched the moon with their feet.

17:36.573 --> 17:37.805
Oh...

17:37.874 --> 17:39.474
Okay, and how many steps does it take

17:39.542 --> 17:41.642
to get from one end of
the Apollo cable to the other?

17:41.711 --> 17:42.643
Zero.

17:42.712 --> 17:44.078
Because you said the cable ran across

17:44.147 --> 17:45.680
the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean,

17:45.748 --> 17:46.848
so you would have to swim

17:46.916 --> 17:48.549
and you would never take any steps.

17:48.618 --> 17:49.584
Hmm.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.052
And Apollo never actually existed

17:51.121 --> 17:52.420
so he never wrote any poems.

17:59.028 --> 18:01.129
Sal, in the backlog directories

18:01.197 --> 18:04.098
you can find everything you
need to fix and secure

18:04.167 --> 18:06.134
your computer and your network.

18:06.202 --> 18:09.237
Just push the button to
start the process.

18:09.305 --> 18:10.238
Ooh!

18:10.306 --> 18:11.739
Can I push it, can I push it?

18:11.808 --> 18:13.107
Yeah, go ahead.

18:13.176 --> 18:14.976
And I will also send you guys

18:15.044 --> 18:17.378
a special treat as an extra reward.

18:17.447 --> 18:18.379
We did it!

18:18.448 --> 18:19.814
Great job, guys.

18:19.883 --> 18:21.749
I couldn't have done this without you.

18:21.818 --> 18:23.818
And who would've guessed
that you could face paint

18:23.887 --> 18:25.186
and read so well?

18:25.255 --> 18:26.521
Yeah, who knew?

18:26.589 --> 18:27.955
Listen...

18:28.024 --> 18:30.992
I think we could make
a great team together.

18:31.060 --> 18:32.693
We can tour the whole world.

18:32.762 --> 18:35.329
Take could tell his
superhero princess stories,

18:35.398 --> 18:36.864
and, Jess, you can make

18:36.933 --> 18:39.433
your signature dragon detectives.

18:39.502 --> 18:41.235
This could be huge.

18:41.304 --> 18:42.703
Thanks for the offer, Yoot,

18:42.772 --> 18:45.706
but I think this was
more of a one-off for us.

18:45.775 --> 18:46.807
Oh...

18:46.876 --> 18:47.909
What we really would like is to get

18:47.977 --> 18:49.210
the description of the person

18:49.279 --> 18:50.545
who bought the green mask from you.

18:50.613 --> 18:51.712
Okay.

18:51.781 --> 18:53.247
I guess I'll have to get
famous on my own then.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.349
Hmm...

18:56.753 --> 18:59.453
He had dark eyes and short hair...

19:01.157 --> 19:03.791
...fidgety, kind of funny looking.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.540
Dude, that's really well done.

19:19.609 --> 19:20.975
Thanks.

19:21.044 --> 19:22.877
But it doesn't look like
any of the relatives.

19:24.747 --> 19:26.714
I think I'm really getting
the hang of this art thing.

19:26.783 --> 19:29.617
So you face-painted
dragon detectives all day?

19:29.686 --> 19:30.718
That's awesome.

19:30.787 --> 19:32.119
Can you make me a detective too?

19:32.188 --> 19:33.421
Absolutely.

19:33.489 --> 19:35.656
So, uh, did you find out
if we can trust Apoll0?

19:35.725 --> 19:36.657
I think so.

19:36.726 --> 19:38.392
He fixed and secured my computer.

19:38.461 --> 19:39.694
And he sent us something.

19:39.762 --> 19:40.728
Really?

19:40.797 --> 19:41.829
What did he send?

19:41.898 --> 19:42.830
I'll show you.

19:42.899 --> 19:43.831
It's in the kitchen.

19:46.236 --> 19:49.036
Apoll0... sent us a little gift.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.741
Doughnuts!

19:53.810 --> 19:55.009
Well, somebody who sends us doughnuts

19:55.078 --> 19:56.177
can't be that bad.

19:56.246 --> 19:57.545
Yeah, well, we still have to be careful,

19:57.614 --> 19:59.814
but I think this Apoll0 is on our side.

19:59.882 --> 20:00.982
That's funny,

20:01.050 --> 20:03.384
because I brought us
a little present too.

20:05.688 --> 20:07.288
Doughnuts!

20:07.357 --> 20:08.789
They were left over from the party.

20:08.858 --> 20:09.924
Look at that flavor.

20:09.993 --> 20:10.958
And that one...

20:11.027 --> 20:13.694
Oh, guys, I'm so sorry I'm late.

20:13.763 --> 20:15.229
But I brought us...

20:16.699 --> 20:18.432
Doughnuts!

20:18.501 --> 20:20.134
Oh, you already have.

20:20.203 --> 20:21.168
Oh, well...

20:23.539 --> 20:24.839
I can't believe it.

20:24.907 --> 20:26.641
You mean you doughnut believe it.

20:26.709 --> 20:28.109
Get it?

20:29.212 --> 20:30.478
Doughnut!

20:30.546 --> 20:32.546
Doughnut... doughnut believe...

20:32.615 --> 20:33.681
That's a good one.

20:33.750 --> 20:34.715
- Wow!
- That one.

20:37.186 --> 20:38.319
A little mustache for you.

20:39.522 --> 20:41.188
And a little mustache for you.

20:41.257 --> 20:43.224
And a little mustache for you.

20:43.293 --> 20:45.326
Ugh, I think I'm full
from all the adventure.

20:45.395 --> 20:46.961
We got a lot done today.

20:47.030 --> 20:48.462
But...

20:48.531 --> 20:51.332
we still don't know who this guy is.

20:51.401 --> 20:52.767
He looks familiar, though.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.302
Yeah?

20:54.370 --> 20:56.370
All right, well, maybe
Apoll0 can help us out.

20:57.707 --> 20:59.707
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:59.776 --> 21:01.475
All right, well, good job, guys.

21:01.544 --> 21:04.211
Uh, sorry, but I think
it's Starface time.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.013
Sorry... bye.

21:06.082 --> 21:08.316
Yeah, I think I'm gonna try to
figure out who Apoll0 is.

21:08.384 --> 21:09.483
Will there be riddles?

21:09.552 --> 21:10.484
Can I come?

21:10.553 --> 21:11.519
Of course you can.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.122
Yeah, I'm gonna head off.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.724
I'll see you at dinner, Anika.

21:24.701 --> 21:25.633
And there you go, sir.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.401
A beautiful mustache for you.

21:34.977 --> 21:35.910
Mmm.

21:38.481 --> 21:39.413
Wait a minute.

21:41.150 --> 21:42.216
I think...

21:43.519 --> 21:44.952
No.

21:45.021 --> 21:46.220
Yes!

21:46.289 --> 21:47.321
No.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.656
Yes!

21:48.725 --> 21:49.990
I think I found something.

21:50.059 --> 21:51.625
Guys, I think I know who it is!
