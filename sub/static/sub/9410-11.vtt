29:50.967 --> 29:53.467
Now the mask and you are one.

29:54.967 --> 29:56.967
You're an old man,

29:57.467 --> 29:59.967
a feeble, helpless old man.

29:59.967 --> 30:02.467
- No, it can't be!
- Will be!

You will do as I say.
Bring it to me.

30:08.467 --> 30:11.467
- Bring what?
- The head of Carly Beth!

30:11.467 --> 30:14.967
- Her head?
- The symbol of love.

30:15.467 --> 30:17.967
It lies on the mantle
in her warm...

if you ever want to see
your young face again.

30:30.467 --> 30:33.467
I will wait...
in the cemetery.

30:33.467 --> 30:36.467
I will wait
amidst the gravestones.

30:36.467 --> 30:40.467
By the stroke of midnight,
and not one second later.

30:40.467 --> 30:43.967
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.967
- Louder.
- Yes.

30:46.967 --> 30:51.967
Now, go!
Bring me the head of Carly Beth,

30:51.967 --> 30:55.467
or the mask stays on
and you will remain...

Did you try Chuck's?
I think they're together.

31:08.733 --> 31:12.700
Uh, no, but it's not important.
We just wanted to stop and say hi.

would you send him home?

We will.

- Do you want some candy?

- Uh, no, that's okay. Good night.
- Good night.

31:24.033 --> 31:27.033
Where is he?
We've got to find him.

31:27.033 --> 31:30.533
- Maybe we should call the police.
- The police can't help, Chuck.

It happened to me.
