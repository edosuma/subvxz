AKU: Long ago
in a distant land,

00:04.464 --> 00:08.927
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.219 --> 00:12.722
unleashed
an unspeakable evil,

00:13.056 --> 00:18.311
but a foolish Samurai warrior
wielding a magic sword

00:18.561 --> 00:21.439
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:29.197 --> 00:33.660
and flung him into the future,
where my evil is law.

00:34.035 --> 00:38.039
Now the fool seeks to return to the past

00:38.164 --> 00:42.752
and undo the future that is Aku.
