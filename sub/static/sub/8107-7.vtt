WEBVTT

00:02.754 --> 00:04.547
We just arrived.

00:05.090 --> 00:07.384
Yeah. Kids okay on your end?

00:08.510 --> 00:09.844
Good.

00:09.969 --> 00:12.514
Yeah, yeah.
He's very excited.

00:12.639 --> 00:15.392
Hey, hey. Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:15.517 --> 00:16.726
Excuse me.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.146
(SCREAMING)

00:21.314 --> 00:23.525
Get away. Get away.

00:24.150 --> 00:26.111
Sorry about that. Sorry.

00:27.779 --> 00:29.239
What's wrong with him?

00:29.948 --> 00:31.533
Excuse us.

00:32.617 --> 00:34.452
I ought to go back
and kick the hell out of that guy.

00:34.703 --> 00:36.538
She was old enough,
she didn't have to scream like that.

00:36.663 --> 00:38.707
It's okay, Dad.
It didn't bother me.

00:38.832 --> 00:41.376
For the first time,
none of these people bother me.

00:41.501 --> 00:43.545
I just think,
"36 more hours."

00:43.670 --> 00:45.797
Thirty-six more hours?
How do you figure that, Kenny?

00:45.922 --> 00:47.674
Tomorrow at this time,
I'm scheduled for surgery.

00:48.133 --> 00:51.386
It's a 10-hour procedure,
throw two in there for prep,

00:51.511 --> 00:54.472
thirty-six until
I'm just another face in the crowd.

01:26.421 --> 01:27.464
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:27.589 --> 01:30.383
Kenny has a frontonasal
encephalocele.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.510
It's a midline deformity.

01:32.635 --> 01:34.637
He's here to undergo
a facial bipartition.

01:34.763 --> 01:35.972
DARNELL:
And what does that mean?

01:36.097 --> 01:38.433
Well, we have
five surgeons, four nurses.

01:38.558 --> 01:40.727
He's going to require
six units of blood.

01:40.935 --> 01:41.770
DARNELL:
Will it fix him?

01:41.936 --> 01:43.730
It'll repair a lot of
the damage done...

01:43.938 --> 01:44.773
We need a sound bite.

01:44.898 --> 01:47.859
Would you say,
"He'll be ready for the junior prom"?

01:48.443 --> 01:50.236
Yeah, yeah.
That's probably true.

01:50.361 --> 01:52.280
No, I mean,
I need you to say it.

01:52.405 --> 01:53.490
<i>CRANK) SURGEON: Dr. Chase,</i>

01:53.615 --> 01:54.866
we got an issue.

01:55.450 --> 01:57.827
Heart rate's skyrocketing,
he's over 180.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.579
- He's in v-fib.
- Paddles!

01:59.704 --> 02:00.830
Charge to 300.

02:00.955 --> 02:01.915
Turn that camera off.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.583
Is this a reaction
to anesthesia?

02:03.708 --> 02:05.668
<i>CRANK) SURGEON:
Haven't given it yet.</i>

02:06.044 --> 02:07.128
CHASE: Clear!

02:07.253 --> 02:08.213
(BEEPING)

02:08.338 --> 02:09.756
Crank it to 360.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.967
I said turn that
damn camera off! Clear!

02:46.251 --> 02:50.672
A teenage boy with a cranial facial
deformity was about to undergo

02:50.797 --> 02:55.468
a reconstructive procedure, when he had
an unexplained cardiac arrest.

02:55.593 --> 02:56.845
Good.

02:57.804 --> 02:59.055
Good?

03:00.014 --> 03:01.724
I mean, go on.

03:03.351 --> 03:06.354
We have the patient
on a pacing wire,

03:06.479 --> 03:09.107
it's the only thing keeping
his heart going.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.693
Yeah, we know.
We're doctors.

03:11.818 --> 03:13.361
Right, it was meant
to be just for them.

03:13.528 --> 03:15.321
DARNELL: Just be yourself.

03:16.406 --> 03:20.493
Until we are able to figure out exactly
what is causing the heart block,

03:20.618 --> 03:23.788
the reconstructive surgery
is on hold, obviously.

03:24.497 --> 03:26.416
That's "yourself"?

03:27.333 --> 03:29.002
Fascinating case.

03:29.127 --> 03:32.463
I will see you again
after I have saved his life.

03:32.589 --> 03:34.757
Have a warm bath waiting.

03:39.053 --> 03:40.388
Are you following me?

03:40.513 --> 03:42.932
Darnell will be trailing you
throughout the case.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.851
DARNELL:
Pretend we're not here.

03:44.976 --> 03:46.644
But if I do that,
won't I bump into you?

03:46.769 --> 03:48.688
DARNELL:
We'll stay out of your way.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.648
No, it was a joke.

03:50.773 --> 03:54.110
See, I became a doctor
because of the movie, Patch Adams.

03:55.612 --> 03:58.072
Listen, do you wanna
get ahead of me and maybe back up,

03:58.197 --> 04:00.825
I don't know, low down,
so I look more powerful?

04:00.992 --> 04:02.619
That's perfect.
Yeah?

04:02.744 --> 04:05.413
Also, my eyes look
better in rooms with summer colors.

04:05.538 --> 04:08.207
You know what?
It's black and white...

04:10.627 --> 04:12.420
You think
I like the cameras?

04:12.545 --> 04:16.633
You think I want the whole world
watching you check out my ass

04:16.758 --> 04:18.509
and question my wardrobe?

04:18.635 --> 04:21.638
Would it be better if I checked out your
wardrobe and questioned your ass?

04:21.763 --> 04:22.847
A little part of me...

04:22.972 --> 04:24.265
There is no
little part of you.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.602
...thought that maybe
you would see

04:27.727 --> 04:29.646
what great PR this could be
for the hospital

04:29.771 --> 04:33.691
and not make me
force you to act like a human being.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.486
You using force on me
is intriguing.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.697
On the other hand,
cameras make people act.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.783
Sometimes like human beings,
sometimes just weird,

04:41.908 --> 04:44.577
sometimes they wear
open-tip bras.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.746
It's cold in here.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.833
A less obvious point is that I need my
team to be unafraid

04:50.959 --> 04:52.502
of the metaphorical fart.

04:52.627 --> 04:55.463
That production company is covering
all the medical costs for this kid.

04:55.588 --> 04:58.591
So either you let them
continue filming

04:58.716 --> 05:01.636
or the kid goes home
with the same face.

05:08.101 --> 05:10.019
Sorry about that. Private.

05:11.771 --> 05:14.023
She waxes her moustache
once a month

05:14.148 --> 05:18.403
and sometimes gets
some pretty gnarly ingrown hairs.

05:27.120 --> 05:31.124
So, did he hire you flat out or are you
competing for one of the spots?

05:31.249 --> 05:32.625
I'm not sure
what you mean by that.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.460
She's not competing.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.755
She was handpicked by House.
She's safe, like Foreman.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.717
So that takes
three spots down to one.

05:45.388 --> 05:47.640
- Where's Foreman?
- He's in the bathroom.

05:47.765 --> 05:50.560
HOUSE: Good. Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

05:51.477 --> 05:52.687
Walks look good on camera.

05:52.812 --> 05:56.190
They give the illusion
of the story moving forward.

06:04.365 --> 06:05.408
New patient.

06:05.533 --> 06:08.995
Sixteen-year-old boy with second-degree
infranodal heart block.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.163
Post-arrest.

06:10.288 --> 06:12.373
THIRTEEN: Any reports
of light-headedness or syncope?

06:12.498 --> 06:13.708
Certainly not
light-headedness.

06:13.833 --> 06:14.959
Why did you hire her?

06:15.084 --> 06:16.252
Not in front of
the company.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.754
Are we gonna
be on TV?

06:17.879 --> 06:18.963
I'm making a music video.

06:19.088 --> 06:20.757
Come on. A little faster,
more energy.

06:20.882 --> 06:22.759
Why are you glad
Foreman's not here?

06:22.884 --> 06:25.595
Because he would object
to what I'm about to do.

06:25.720 --> 06:26.637
Oh!

06:31.267 --> 06:32.518
Sorry.

06:34.896 --> 06:36.439
Hey, buddy.

06:36.773 --> 06:39.650
You stay in there, we'll be out here,
making sure he doesn't move again.

06:39.776 --> 06:42.236
God! Finally
I hear myself think.

06:42.695 --> 06:45.239
- Our patient has...
- Why did you hire her?

06:46.783 --> 06:49.452
Because she has way
more diagnostic experience

06:49.577 --> 06:51.954
than the other
swimsuit models I was considering.

06:52.080 --> 06:56.334
Our patient has a frontonasal
encephalocele with a midline cleft.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.212
(EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)

06:59.337 --> 07:01.547
Don't stare
directly at it.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.841
So what caused
"Big Head's" heart to stop?

07:03.966 --> 07:05.635
TAUB:
Simple. His big head.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.054
Increased intracranial pressure
would cause heart block.

07:08.179 --> 07:12.058
Wrong. Sixteen years they've been
testing that insane noggin to death.

07:12.183 --> 07:14.685
What about
a congenital heart defect?

07:14.811 --> 07:16.187
He has a midline
anomaly on his head,

07:16.312 --> 07:19.816
makes sense he'd have
a midline anomaly in his heart, too.

07:19.941 --> 07:21.651
The 16 years of
testing didn't show?

07:21.776 --> 07:24.070
Why did you bring her
in so late? It's not fair.

07:24.195 --> 07:25.947
- The rest of us...
- Hey, hey, hey! You wanted fair,

07:26.072 --> 07:28.574
you picked the wrong job,
the wrong profession,

07:28.699 --> 07:29.867
the wrong species.

07:29.992 --> 07:30.993
Forget the deformity.

07:31.119 --> 07:33.788
Treat the patient like
he's any other really, really ugly kid.

07:33.913 --> 07:35.873
Infection?
Could be endocarditis.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.167
Well, since he doesn't have
a prosthetic heart valve,

07:38.292 --> 07:40.545
I assume you're thinking
he's an IV drug user?

07:40.670 --> 07:41.671
House said
assume he's normal.

07:41.796 --> 07:44.006
Dealers don't ask for ID
and don't care what you look like.

07:44.132 --> 07:46.008
Nice. You're right
about the habit.

07:46.134 --> 07:47.677
You're wrong about
the substance.

07:47.802 --> 07:51.180
Blackened skin under the nose
equals frostbite from huffing Freon.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.849
Freon's toxic,
it damages the heart.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.476
Discoloration could
be acanthosis nigricans.

07:55.601 --> 07:57.436
It's a common side effect
of these deformities.

07:57.562 --> 07:59.730
There's also discoloration
on the cheeks and forehead.

07:59.856 --> 08:01.065
Do a nuclear study.

08:01.190 --> 08:04.652
If I'm right,
you'll see scarring of the heart.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.449
(DOOR CLOSING)

08:10.575 --> 08:12.702
I'm not part of
some game, am I?

08:12.827 --> 08:16.497
I gave up a career
because I thought this was a firm offer.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.457
Yes, this is a real offer.

08:25.006 --> 08:26.924
I think
she might be an idiot.

08:27.049 --> 08:29.552
- Who?
- No, she can't be an idiot.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.679
I mean, she was in the CIA,
for God's sake.

08:31.804 --> 08:34.056
And the Bay of Pigs
was a daring triumph.

08:34.182 --> 08:36.058
She had good ideas
in Langley.

08:36.184 --> 08:37.351
All your ideas.

08:37.476 --> 08:39.770
She was able to identify
that they were good ideas.

08:39.896 --> 08:41.439
Stab in the dark here,
is she pretty?

08:41.564 --> 08:42.607
She's new.

08:42.732 --> 08:43.941
- She's nervous.
- She's a C-cup.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.735
She said one dumb thing
in a differential.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.695
They all say dumb things
in differentials.

08:47.820 --> 08:48.779
A D-cup?

08:48.905 --> 08:50.323
If she's no good,
just fire her.

08:50.448 --> 08:53.367
I can't.
I just hired her.

08:54.285 --> 08:55.828
She left a career.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.706
Wow.

08:58.831 --> 09:02.543
Either that's actual guilt,
or I have got to see this woman.

09:04.962 --> 09:07.298
My son is not huffing Freon.

09:07.423 --> 09:11.594
Mr. Arnold, Dr. House is like a
savant when it comes to diagnostics.

09:12.428 --> 09:14.138
What's his genius theory?

09:14.263 --> 09:17.892
Because Kenny's not normal,
he's doing drugs to deal with his pain?

09:18.017 --> 09:21.896
Maybe the way to
look at this is that you are normal.

09:23.606 --> 09:24.732
And what's that
supposed to mean?

09:24.857 --> 09:29.403
You're like any other parent who thinks
his kid can't be doing drugs.

09:34.992 --> 09:37.161
Doing this because
my dad thinks I'm on drugs?

09:37.286 --> 09:39.330
I was doing drugs
behind my parent's back at your age,

09:39.455 --> 09:41.832
and I had a lot
less reason to be.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.919
Not that your life
must be miserable.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.465
Not that I'm suggesting
that you should be doing drugs.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.133
- How's school going?
- I'm home schooled.

09:51.259 --> 09:53.552
Really? You're lucky.

09:54.262 --> 09:55.346
Going to school
was boring.

09:55.471 --> 09:57.890
My dad took me out,
and it wasn't because it was boring.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.976
I had a rough time
in school, too.

10:00.101 --> 10:04.230
Maybe not like you, but, you know...
I don't mean to compare our situations.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.858
Actually, I guess I am
comparing our situations,

10:07.984 --> 10:10.695
but only to show you
how yours is worse.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.864
You can edit that out, right,
so I don't look like an idiot?

10:13.990 --> 10:17.076
Relax. Everyone acts like
an idiot around me.

10:17.493 --> 10:19.620
Makes you think
it's not an act.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.163
Can I have something
for my headache?

10:21.330 --> 10:22.331
Yeah, is that new?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.749
Sixteen years old.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.043
Has the same birthday I do.

10:27.253 --> 10:29.213
I'm gonna start
the test now.

10:29.964 --> 10:31.882
KUTNER: Study showed
no signs of scarring on Kenny's heart.

10:32.008 --> 10:33.009
TAUB: It wasn't drugs.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.302
HOUSE: Well, then,
give me something better.

10:34.427 --> 10:35.386
What's causing
heart block?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.971
It could be
toxoplasmosis.

10:37.096 --> 10:38.639
We should do an LP
to test for infection.

10:38.764 --> 10:41.183
If it was toxoplasmosis,
we'd have seen enlarged lymphs,

10:41.309 --> 10:44.353
and because you're not pretty enough to
be an idiot, you must know that already,

10:44.478 --> 10:46.105
which means you just
said it because you want to do an LP

10:46.230 --> 10:47.315
to look for
intracranial pressure.

10:47.440 --> 10:48.816
Because it is
intracranial pressure.

10:48.941 --> 10:50.276
Wait, I'm not done.

10:50.401 --> 10:51.569
You thought
I wouldn't catch on,

10:51.694 --> 10:53.696
which means you either think I'm
an idiot, which is flattering,

10:53.821 --> 10:55.364
I've been doing
my hair differently...

10:55.489 --> 10:57.783
The kid's got headaches. He's been
popping acetaminophen like peanuts.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.535
How could you possibly
think that I was done?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.746
I prefaced that with an "either."
It needs an "or."

11:01.871 --> 11:03.706
Or, you are an idiot,

11:03.831 --> 11:07.376
which is possible, I'm not great
at judging men's looks.

11:07.752 --> 11:08.794
The OR?

11:08.919 --> 11:10.796
DARNELL: And the MRI room.

11:12.048 --> 11:13.382
Yes...

11:14.592 --> 11:16.260
Dr. House frequently conducts

11:16.385 --> 11:19.555
differential diagnoses
in a variety of places.

11:19.764 --> 11:22.808
He feels that
a change in venue

11:22.933 --> 11:25.895
often leads to a change
in thinking processes.

11:28.773 --> 11:31.859
I have to go take care
of something else.

11:31.984 --> 11:33.694
Just let me do a CT scan,
see if I'm right.

11:33.819 --> 11:34.904
The sooner
we fix the problem,

11:35.029 --> 11:36.906
the sooner we can get to
his reconstructive surgery.

11:37.031 --> 11:39.575
Yeah. Who cares if you're dead?
It's how you look.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.078
Well, since you've given me nothing
better, we're back to drugs.

11:42.203 --> 11:44.288
The one thing
we know it's not.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.499
Decreased uptake
on the membranous septum.

11:46.624 --> 11:48.125
Could be an artifact.
We can redo it, but...

11:48.250 --> 11:50.795
Nothing's nothing.
Do an EP study.

11:51.754 --> 11:55.132
EP study means
we have to stop this kid's heart.

11:56.509 --> 11:58.094
I'll set it up.

11:58.552 --> 12:02.056
House, do you have a minute
to be disemboweled?

12:05.893 --> 12:06.977
I'm gonna thread this catheter

12:07.103 --> 12:08.896
through different areas in your heart,

12:09.021 --> 12:13.109
and once I've found the right pathway,
I'll apply some electrical energy.

12:13.442 --> 12:14.902
It'll stop my heart?

12:15.027 --> 12:17.363
It sounds
worse than it is. You'll be fine.

12:17.488 --> 12:18.447
Is it gonna hurt?

12:18.572 --> 12:20.324
There'll be
some discomfort.

12:22.410 --> 12:25.538
If you've done drugs,
I understand.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.249
Being different's
really hard.

12:33.712 --> 12:37.633
Kenny, it's more important
for you to get better

12:37.758 --> 12:40.511
than to worry about
getting in trouble.

12:41.303 --> 12:43.139
If I did drugs,
that could explain my heart problem?

12:43.264 --> 12:44.640
It could.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.767
And then you could
do the surgery to fix my face?

12:46.892 --> 12:48.644
That's why we're here.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.483
You know how famous people,

12:54.942 --> 12:58.654
everywhere they go
people are watching them, staring?

12:59.572 --> 13:02.324
They never
have a chance to just be,

13:03.159 --> 13:06.579
you know? And a lot of
them turn to drugs.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.247
And people stare at them
because they're beautiful,

13:08.456 --> 13:09.957
but, me they just stare...

13:10.082 --> 13:11.500
(COUGHING)

13:11.625 --> 13:12.793
You Okay?

13:13.586 --> 13:16.755
I need to know what
kind of drugs, Kenny, and how much.

13:16.881 --> 13:17.882
(COUGHS)

13:18.007 --> 13:20.342
Coke, mostly.
A lot of coke.

13:20.468 --> 13:25.556
And then when I run out,
I usually go to LSD or acid.

13:27.183 --> 13:28.767
Those are the same thing.

13:28.893 --> 13:30.394
They are?

13:30.978 --> 13:32.855
You don't do drugs,
do you?

13:32.980 --> 13:34.398
I drank from
my dad's liquor cabinet one time...

13:34.523 --> 13:35.691
- We're not gonna do this test.
- No...

13:35.816 --> 13:37.067
(COUGHING)

13:37.193 --> 13:38.402
I need you to turn
on your side.

13:38.527 --> 13:39.528
(RAPID BEEPING)

13:39.653 --> 13:42.615
We need to intubate.
I need some help in here!

13:46.952 --> 13:49.955
HOUSE: Too bad you guys
are going for a theatrical release.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.208
Vomiting blood would have
made a great act-out.

13:52.625 --> 13:53.459
Likely causes?

13:53.584 --> 13:54.543
Mallory-Weiss tear.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.212
No pallor, no melena.

13:56.337 --> 13:57.963
Why are you wearing a tie?

13:58.130 --> 14:00.841
I always wear ties,
I'm a doctor.

14:00.966 --> 14:02.510
DARNELL: Please don't look
at the camera.

14:02.635 --> 14:03.761
Sorry.

14:04.303 --> 14:05.429
Nasal papilloma.

14:05.554 --> 14:07.264
Hemorrhage could have
overwhelmed the heart.

14:07.556 --> 14:08.599
HOUSE: Nice lipstick.

14:08.724 --> 14:09.558
Thank you.

14:09.683 --> 14:10.809
HOUSE: Bad idea.

14:11.310 --> 14:12.895
The hemorrhage came
after the block.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.397
House, let them
do their job.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.608
Is anybody here
more interested in the medicine,

14:17.733 --> 14:19.610
a little less interested
in the paparazzi?

14:19.735 --> 14:20.903
Upper GI bleed.

14:21.028 --> 14:24.740
Could be something
he ate or drank. Maybe a peptic ulcer.

14:25.324 --> 14:26.617
Good.

14:26.742 --> 14:29.912
Except no abdominal pain,
patient hasn't lost his appetite

14:30.037 --> 14:31.997
and the last I checked,
the gastrointestinal tract

14:32.122 --> 14:34.625
isn't connected to the heart.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.669
Yeah, but other
than that, real good.

14:36.794 --> 14:38.963
Nasopharyngeal angiofibrosis.

14:39.088 --> 14:41.048
I just said
it wasn't a nasal tumor.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.050
COLE: Stomach cancer.
Tumor causes bleeding,

14:43.175 --> 14:45.719
body's reaction to the tumor causes
paraneoplastic syndrome,

14:45.844 --> 14:46.720
which leads to heart block.

14:46.845 --> 14:49.807
Finally, someone who is
not just a pretty face.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.685
You and Taub,
run the scope, find the tumor.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.312
Could be dangerous. If the bleeding
was caused by liver failure

14:55.437 --> 14:56.647
as a result of the
intracranial pressure...

14:56.772 --> 15:01.151
Liver is the one organ you can't
ascribe to intracranial pressure.

15:04.405 --> 15:05.739
True.

15:09.994 --> 15:12.371
Intracranial pressure
can cause liver problems.

15:12.496 --> 15:15.416
It causes an increase in the cavernous
sinus pressure, which causes pressure

15:15.541 --> 15:18.502
in the superior vena cava,
which shuts down the liver.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.462
- Did you just think of that?
- No.

15:20.588 --> 15:21.755
Then why didn't
you say anything in...

15:21.880 --> 15:24.133
Think it would've
changed his mind? Not a chance.

15:24.258 --> 15:25.509
House would have
undercut me,

15:25.634 --> 15:27.344
and forced me to do a procedure
I just argued against,

15:27.469 --> 15:30.347
and then I'd look like a hypocrite
in front of the thousands of people

15:30.472 --> 15:32.766
and potential future employers
watching this film.

15:32.891 --> 15:37.438
If you're right, and we stick a scope
back down a kid with liver failure,

15:37.563 --> 15:39.231
he could bleed again.

15:39.356 --> 15:40.399
I know.

15:43.611 --> 15:45.779
He just vomited blood.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.240
Isn't that dangerous?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.244
No. You're in good hands.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.413
(SIGHS)

15:54.538 --> 15:56.874
Okay. All right.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.007
Well, it's great how he rebounded
from that setback.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.176
DARNELL: What setback?

16:07.301 --> 16:09.595
He didn't tell you
about the...

16:09.720 --> 16:11.388
Well, that's his right.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.557
The records were sealed.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.100
Personally, I think he was just
tapping his foot

16:15.225 --> 16:16.894
and reaching for
the toilet paper.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.396
Obviously it was
a witch hunt.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.149
DARNELL: You think
they singled him out because...

16:22.274 --> 16:25.402
No. Literally, a witch hunt.
Dr. House is a practicing Wiccan.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.529
It's a beautiful religion,
it's very caring.

16:27.655 --> 16:28.864
(DOOR OPENING)

16:28.989 --> 16:30.783
HOUSE:
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:31.408 --> 16:35.079
You have an all-access pass
to the case, not my Fave 5s. Now, go.

16:35.371 --> 16:37.623
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

16:40.626 --> 16:41.669
(DOOR CLOSING)

16:41.794 --> 16:43.420
I think
I'm going blind.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.631
Hairy palms, too?

16:45.756 --> 16:49.635
She said something idiotic again
and I didn't even notice it.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.553
Foreman had to point
out that it was idiotic.

16:51.679 --> 16:52.888
She's making me an idiot.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.515
It's cute.
You have a crush.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.141
No, I think
it's something systemic.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.559
Thirteen's pretty.

16:57.685 --> 16:59.061
You're obviously
okay with her.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.604
She killed a patient.

17:00.729 --> 17:01.647
The bitch is pretty.

17:01.772 --> 17:02.815
The bitch is a bitch.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.359
- Ask her out.
- The bitch? She's a bitch.

17:05.526 --> 17:06.944
No, the one that's
making you an idiot.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.321
It's the story of life.
Boy meets girl. Boy gets stupid.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.906
Boy and girl live
stupidly ever after.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.366
(PAGER BEEPING)

17:13.367 --> 17:14.618
- Pretty girl kill again?
- No.

17:14.743 --> 17:17.705
Elephant boy just
vomiting up blood again.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.253
No tumors in the
patient's stomach, so...

17:24.378 --> 17:25.671
But the scope caused
variceal bleeding.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.798
Took 20 minutes of banding
to stop it.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.258
Taub was right about
the liver failure.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.342
Yeah.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.429
His craniofacial deformity is causing
intracranial pressure...

17:33.554 --> 17:34.388
- No.
- ...which is causing...

17:34.513 --> 17:37.516
Where are the nosebleeds?
Where's the labored breathing?

17:37.641 --> 17:38.726
You were right
about me being wrong.

17:38.851 --> 17:40.185
You were wrong
about you being right.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.438
I need new ideas.
Anybody?

17:55.367 --> 17:56.994
Does it bother you that
this kid's gonna die

17:57.119 --> 17:59.455
because you won't
put down that camera at all? You know?

17:59.580 --> 18:01.290
Your people should
be extra motivated.

18:01.415 --> 18:02.541
I'm sure they all wanna
look good in the film.

18:02.666 --> 18:05.294
No, 'cause now they're too worried
about looking bad.

18:05.419 --> 18:09.339
Dr. House, heart block plus liver
failure could mean autoimmune.

18:09.465 --> 18:11.425
Maybe scleroderma.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.845
Foreman?
Does that make sense?

18:14.970 --> 18:16.513
Not without
tight skin on the hands,

18:16.638 --> 18:19.683
muscle weakness
and a 30-year-old patient.

18:19.808 --> 18:24.188
Liver failure plus heart block
could be a mitochondrial disorder.

18:26.023 --> 18:28.525
Hey, say what
she just said.

18:28.650 --> 18:32.613
Liver failure plus heart block could be
a mitochondrial disorder?

18:34.031 --> 18:35.574
Go look for signs of
retinal degeneration.

18:35.699 --> 18:38.327
No, it's ICP.
You're only gonna see swelling.

18:38.452 --> 18:41.914
Take him with you,
so he can see the degeneration, too.

18:43.624 --> 18:45.167
DARNELL: So before you worked
here in the ER,

18:45.292 --> 18:46.543
you worked for House, right?

18:46.668 --> 18:47.711
Three and a half years.

18:47.836 --> 18:48.670
Why did you leave?

18:48.837 --> 18:50.214
Hey. I don't
wanna be on TV.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.340
I'm not signing
a release.

18:51.465 --> 18:52.549
We'll blur you out.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.468
Take off your pants.

18:55.177 --> 18:57.679
You gonna be able
to use any of this if I start swearing?

18:57.805 --> 19:01.391
Did House treat you as badly
as he treats his current fellows?

19:01.517 --> 19:02.434
Loaded question.

19:02.559 --> 19:03.644
(EXCLAIMS)

19:04.353 --> 19:05.354
That's not even a word.

19:05.479 --> 19:06.480
(LAUGHS)

19:06.605 --> 19:08.106
Fork!

19:08.232 --> 19:09.316
Very clever.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.652
I learnt how to be
a doctor from House.

19:11.777 --> 19:14.363
Or at least a doctor who learnt
how to be a doctor from House,

19:14.488 --> 19:15.614
if that makes any sense.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.575
And you left his team
because you couldn't stand him anymore?

19:18.700 --> 19:21.245
No, no. I love Dr. House.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.831
Now, that's something
we haven't heard.

19:23.956 --> 19:25.332
I mean...

19:26.166 --> 19:27.960
What did
you ask me again?

19:28.085 --> 19:29.711
DARNELL: Why you um.

19:29.837 --> 19:34.091
I loved being around him,

19:34.508 --> 19:35.592
professionally.

19:35.717 --> 19:38.679
You know, he was
always stimulating.

19:38.804 --> 19:42.391
Not in an erotic
sense of the word.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.686
Fork. They forked,
and then they spooned!

19:47.437 --> 19:50.524
Lean forward, and place your chin
on the rest.

19:54.611 --> 19:55.445
I can't reach it.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.823
Scooch in a little.

19:59.783 --> 20:00.951
I'll take care of it.

20:01.076 --> 20:02.744
Just like last time?

20:04.413 --> 20:07.916
Maybe we should try this
the old-fashioned way.

20:08.792 --> 20:12.629
Okay, look up to the ceiling
and try not to blink, okay?

20:17.426 --> 20:19.344
Okay, good.
Now straight ahead.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.561
There it is.
Swelling, no degeneration.

20:29.605 --> 20:30.856
It's not mitochondrial.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.733
Swelling proves there's increased
pressure in his brain.

20:33.150 --> 20:33.984
Absolutely.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.903
So, now we can schedule
the reconstruction?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.529
Absolutely not.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.114
Your test proved
you wrong.

20:39.239 --> 20:40.908
We found exactly what
I predicted we'd find.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.076
Swelling means
there's increased pressure.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.203
You get a gold Star of David
for proving,

20:45.329 --> 20:46.496
yes, this kid
has a big head

20:46.622 --> 20:49.458
and big heads cause pressure.
Doesn't explain the liver.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.751
Too much
acetaminophen does.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.629
JRA explains all of it,
including the liver.

20:53.754 --> 20:56.173
One theory's better
than two. Treat with steroids.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.884
If you're wrong, steroids are gonna mess
with his immune system,

20:59.009 --> 21:01.553
put off his surgery
for months.

21:02.095 --> 21:06.016
You really wanna lose
this argument in front of the camera?

21:08.852 --> 21:11.104
I'll speak to the father.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.359
Dr. House believes
that Kenny has JRA.

21:15.484 --> 21:17.319
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.529
We need to start
administering steroids.

21:19.655 --> 21:22.366
Will the steroids fix it?

21:27.371 --> 21:29.039
I don't think he has JRA.

21:29.665 --> 21:31.416
I think
Dr. House is wrong,

21:31.541 --> 21:34.670
and that the steroid
treatment could be dangerous.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.714
I think I can get House
thrown off the case,

21:37.839 --> 21:40.759
and get Kenny
the facial surgery he needs.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.433
CUDDY: The father refused steroids until
we're sure about the diagnosis.

21:48.558 --> 21:49.685
I am sure.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.311
It's JRA.

21:51.478 --> 21:52.980
And why would
he even doubt that,

21:53.105 --> 21:56.358
unless a former fellow of mine
was chirping in his ear?

21:56.566 --> 21:58.735
The decision was his.
I merely voiced my concern.

21:58.860 --> 21:59.695
Why did you
take this job?

21:59.820 --> 22:01.029
He's got a bulging cyst.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.323
Perfectly good plastic
surgery practice, lots of money.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.700
Fluids aren't
draining properly.

22:04.825 --> 22:07.494
Temptation to come screw with me
just too much for you?

22:07.619 --> 22:08.662
There's gotta be
a better reason.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.372
He needs surgery
to drain it.

22:10.497 --> 22:14.001
Oh, and I think
I mentioned this earlier. You're fired.

22:18.171 --> 22:21.216
What you did
was over the line. Get out.

22:24.261 --> 22:27.597
But don't go anywhere.
You're not fired, yet.

22:31.268 --> 22:33.353
No one is firing anyone
in the middle of this case.

22:33.478 --> 22:34.688
Not while those
cameras are here,

22:34.813 --> 22:38.859
and not while Taub is the only person
that this father trusts.

22:39.568 --> 22:40.402
Where are you going?

22:40.527 --> 22:41.987
To do what I always do
in these situations.

22:42.112 --> 22:43.864
Treat my patient
behind his back.

22:44.281 --> 22:45.282
That's one option.

22:45.741 --> 22:48.201
Or you can do a CT scan
of the kid's head.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.579
If there's no midline shift,
we know Taub's wrong

22:50.704 --> 22:54.249
and you get your consent
to give the kid steroids.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.168
Just a warning.

22:56.293 --> 22:59.004
If we have to start getting consent
every time we do a procedure,

22:59.129 --> 23:02.257
soon they'll be asking
for informed consent.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.057
FOREMAN: Didn't think
you had the guts to stage a coup.

23:10.307 --> 23:13.268
Coup failed.
I'm scheduled for execution at dawn.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.227
No, you're not.

23:14.352 --> 23:15.604
No reprieve
from the governor.

23:15.729 --> 23:18.607
You're a test result
away from becoming House's front runner.

23:18.732 --> 23:21.234
He doesn't care about what you said,
or what you did five minutes ago.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.861
He just wants
the next good idea.

23:23.153 --> 23:26.406
Show me 20 percent
magnification of the forebrain.

23:26.782 --> 23:32.120
I look at our patient, as soon as I
saw his face, I saw a regular kid.

23:32.954 --> 23:36.374
One thing about being a plastic surgeon,
you don't see what is,

23:36.500 --> 23:37.834
you see what could be.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.419
Talk like that around House,

23:39.544 --> 23:42.839
doesn't matter how many
good ideas you come up with.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.176
SURGEON: So,

23:46.718 --> 23:49.346
tell me
what you don't like about yourself.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.514
Gosh.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.225
There's so many things.

23:53.391 --> 23:57.229
Is Dr. Taub available?
Because he was very highly recommended.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.189
Well, he's no longer
practicing with us,

23:59.314 --> 24:00.649
but I've taken over
all his files,

24:00.774 --> 24:01.942
so if you tell me
what needs work...

24:02.067 --> 24:03.360
Do you know why he left?

24:03.485 --> 24:06.154
He had personal issues
to deal with, so if we could just...

24:06.321 --> 24:08.073
My goodness.
Is he okay?

24:08.198 --> 24:09.658
Oh, yeah, he's fine.
He's fine.

24:09.783 --> 24:12.828
Because my friend
had his ears done by Dr. Taub.

24:12.953 --> 24:15.789
Should he worry that
they may pop back?

24:15.914 --> 24:17.415
No, it wasn't
a professional issue.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.459
I'm sorry,
I really can't go into more detail.

24:19.584 --> 24:21.878
Shall we discuss
your needs?

24:22.379 --> 24:26.591
You know that toe next to the big toe?
Mine's bigger than my big toe.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.302
Is there any way to shorten it?
Or make my big toe bigger?

24:29.427 --> 24:31.388
Like, a toe-gmentation?

24:32.556 --> 24:35.058
Did he lie,
cheat or steal?

24:35.183 --> 24:37.394
You're not here
for a consultation, are you?

24:37.519 --> 24:39.563
What gave me away?

24:39.688 --> 24:42.274
Was it my obviously
perfect feet?

24:46.444 --> 24:47.612
(DOOR OPENS)

24:49.239 --> 24:50.407
Hi.

24:51.408 --> 24:52.409
CT shows that...

24:52.534 --> 24:53.577
Let's go.

24:58.290 --> 24:59.541
What are you two
doing here?

24:59.666 --> 25:01.001
Skipping three scenes.

25:01.126 --> 25:03.879
CT's back. He's gonna say that there's
evidence of an anomaly,

25:04.004 --> 25:05.046
I'm gonna say,
he's wrong.

25:05.172 --> 25:07.674
He's gonna go back to the father
and we'll all end up here.

25:07.799 --> 25:10.093
The defect is pushing
on the right frontal lobe.

25:10.218 --> 25:11.720
This bend is a sign
of herniation.

25:11.928 --> 25:15.182
Or, it's a sign
of increased pressure from JRA.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.394
Dr. Taub would rather
distract you from the truth

25:19.519 --> 25:22.731
with sparkly things,
like four karat diamonds.

25:22.856 --> 25:23.899
House.

25:24.024 --> 25:26.151
Your partner said
that you left for personal reasons,

25:26.401 --> 25:27.569
but your wife said
you lost a patient.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.446
You son of a bitch,
you spoke to my wife?

25:29.571 --> 25:30.488
See, that confused me.

25:30.614 --> 25:32.115
Why would
you give her a diamond

25:32.240 --> 25:33.700
if you screwed
somebody else over?

25:33.825 --> 25:36.036
If you screwed her over,
I mean, I could...

25:36.161 --> 25:37.954
Get that camera
out of here!

25:42.584 --> 25:44.669
You say anything to her?

25:44.794 --> 25:45.837
Just asked questions.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.214
Get them
out of here, too.

25:47.339 --> 25:48.715
We're doctors.

25:51.801 --> 25:55.347
I screwed around
with a nurse. It became a deal.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.392
My partners found out
and I resigned.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.311
There. Happy?

26:02.062 --> 26:04.940
If you could be
a bit more descriptive, I'd be happier.

26:05.065 --> 26:07.400
Some people pop
pain pills,

26:08.109 --> 26:09.778
I cheat.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.780
We all have our vices.

26:16.993 --> 26:21.539
Taub, I don't see it.
Stay away from the family.

26:21.873 --> 26:25.418
House, start steroids
and stay away from his family.

26:35.553 --> 26:38.265
Wow, you are ugly.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.268
Wow, you're an ass.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.144
I have a deformity.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.105
I know, that's
why you're ugly.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.398
But you're
a lucky boy.

26:46.523 --> 26:47.732
Anywhere else
in the animal kingdom,

26:47.983 --> 26:50.068
your parents would have
eaten you at birth.

26:50.193 --> 26:52.487
Your son needs steroids.

26:52.612 --> 26:53.571
Dr. Cuddy agrees.

26:53.697 --> 26:54.990
Does Dr. Taub?

26:56.366 --> 26:59.452
He's not a real doctor.
He's a plastic surgeon.

26:59.577 --> 27:02.289
All he cares is
that your son looks good in his coffin.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.582
So, I'm supposed
to believe you?

27:04.708 --> 27:05.959
The doctor who cares.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.794
You shouldn't care
if I care.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.963
I don't trust you.

27:10.088 --> 27:13.300
Because I don't think
the surgery's important?

27:14.175 --> 27:17.304
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

27:17.429 --> 27:20.515
You're willing to take chances to risk
his life for something he doesn't need?

27:20.640 --> 27:21.975
I do need it.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.440
I can't have
real relationships.

27:28.565 --> 27:30.608
I can't even have
a real conversation.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.610
Not even with my dad.

27:36.698 --> 27:37.907
Dad.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.536
I know you love me.

27:42.078 --> 27:44.497
But you don't
treat me normal.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.083
You're always protective.

27:47.542 --> 27:50.086
The world
can always go to hell.

27:51.338 --> 27:53.506
But you never yell at me.

27:53.923 --> 27:56.051
Even when I screw up.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.513
I wanna be normal.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.728
Take your steroids,
and you get to live.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.773
Then you can
do your surgery.

28:11.399 --> 28:13.651
But it'll only
change your face.

28:14.569 --> 28:17.364
It won't change
who your face made you.

28:23.578 --> 28:24.662
WILSON: We're gonna get caught.

28:24.788 --> 28:26.164
HOUSE: Not on film.

28:26.289 --> 28:29.292
All their camera
equipment's in here.

28:29.417 --> 28:31.086
Where did
you get those keys?

28:31.211 --> 28:33.004
Blue, the janitor.

28:34.589 --> 28:35.548
What?

28:36.591 --> 28:38.218
That's his name.

28:39.469 --> 28:41.221
His name's Lou.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.057
Owe him an apology.

28:46.184 --> 28:47.685
Just watch 20 minutes
of this stuff,

28:47.811 --> 28:48.812
tell me if
I'm out of my mind.

28:48.937 --> 28:51.272
Finally, we have
video evidence.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.901
TERZI: Dr. House, heart block
plus liver failure

28:55.026 --> 28:55.985
could mean autoimmune.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.779
Maybe scleroderma.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.781
HOUSE: Foreman?
Does that make sense?

28:59.906 --> 29:01.408
FOREMAN: Not without
tight skin on the hands,

29:01.533 --> 29:04.786
muscle weakness
and a 30-year-old patient.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.788
Can I see that again?

29:07.205 --> 29:09.332
What did you miss?
She screwed up, I didn't...

29:09.457 --> 29:10.834
No, just the part
where she leans forward.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.795
I think you can
see through her dress.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.466
TERZI: Upper GI bleed.

29:18.591 --> 29:21.678
Could be something he ate or drank.
Maybe a peptic ulcer.

29:21.803 --> 29:22.971
HOUSE: Good.

29:23.471 --> 29:26.015
You thought
that was a good idea?

29:26.141 --> 29:27.308
What am I gonna do?

29:27.934 --> 29:28.768
Just enjoy.

29:29.769 --> 29:32.605
I'm gonna keep her around,
because she makes me an idiot?

29:32.730 --> 29:35.066
Well, you're protected,
Foreman seems immune.

29:35.442 --> 29:36.609
You think he's gay?

29:36.943 --> 29:38.903
Did he become an idiot
around Chase?

29:40.196 --> 29:41.239
HOUSE: I just said
it's not a nasal...

29:41.614 --> 29:44.200
Wait a minute, rewind that.
Was that Thirteen?

29:47.120 --> 29:48.329
Wow.

29:48.788 --> 29:50.457
I can't believe
I'm that guy.

29:50.582 --> 29:52.417
Every guy is that guy.

29:52.542 --> 29:53.626
I'm not every guy-

29:53.751 --> 29:55.170
What is this?
Semantics here?

29:55.295 --> 29:57.297
Okay, all guys
are that guy.

29:57.422 --> 29:59.382
I'm not all guys!

30:01.801 --> 30:02.719
Cameron was smart.

30:02.844 --> 30:05.680
You know, I'm beginning
to doubt that.

30:10.226 --> 30:13.396
I wanted to clarify
something I said earlier.

30:13.771 --> 30:15.773
"I love Dr. House,"

30:15.899 --> 30:19.694
and then I qualified it,
which, after thinking about it,

30:20.111 --> 30:22.447
I didn't really need to do.

30:22.864 --> 30:25.283
I did love being around him.

30:26.242 --> 30:29.412
I guess, I just
wanted to qualify

30:30.246 --> 30:33.541
what I qualified before.

30:35.793 --> 30:36.753
I'm looking defensive,
aren't I?

30:36.920 --> 30:39.964
No, no. I think that's great.
Clears everything up.

30:46.346 --> 30:47.764
It's no big deal, really...

30:51.267 --> 30:53.895
There's a mass lesion
in the left anterior temporal lobe

30:54.020 --> 30:56.064
surrounded by oedema.

30:56.189 --> 30:58.858
Did you just insult me
in Pig Latin?

30:58.983 --> 31:00.693
Dr. House, please.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.947
Will you just take
a look at this?

31:05.406 --> 31:09.285
The defect is causing
this nodular shadow here, you see it?

31:10.370 --> 31:13.498
You're right,
I didn't see that before.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.043
Come on, let's go.

31:19.462 --> 31:20.672
Hey.

31:21.005 --> 31:24.592
I know you think you're feeling better,
on account of feeling better,

31:24.717 --> 31:29.097
but this trusted family doctor
thinks that he's found a mass lesion,

31:29.222 --> 31:32.183
so if you could lie back down
and struggle to breathe...

31:32.308 --> 31:33.601
Okay-

31:34.435 --> 31:36.229
You were right.

31:36.854 --> 31:38.982
I'm thrilled I'm wrong.

31:39.774 --> 31:41.109
This is great, Kenny.

31:41.234 --> 31:43.736
You're gonna
get your surgery now.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.073
First person I'm coming
back to see is you,

31:47.198 --> 31:49.784
because compared to me,
you're gonna look like butt.

31:50.034 --> 31:51.202
Hey!

31:51.411 --> 31:53.162
What, no comeback?

31:54.956 --> 31:56.457
Look at that.

31:56.583 --> 31:57.417
What?

31:57.834 --> 32:00.295
His little finger,
it's twitching.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.340
No, it's not.

32:04.465 --> 32:07.051
Just give it a second. There.

32:07.468 --> 32:08.511
TAUB: And?

32:09.012 --> 32:10.597
He's not better.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.933
What's wrong?

32:14.058 --> 32:15.518
My diagnosis.

32:16.811 --> 32:18.938
I don't know what he has.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.441
Cancel the surgery.

32:28.615 --> 32:32.535
New symptom.
Involuntary muscle movement.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.078
Twitching finger
is a symptom?

32:34.203 --> 32:35.580
The body doing something
it's not supposed to do

32:35.705 --> 32:37.373
is the definition
of a symptom.

32:37.498 --> 32:40.043
Kid's about to have
a life-changing operation. He's nervous.

32:40.168 --> 32:41.127
Or he's not.

32:41.252 --> 32:42.378
FOREMAN:
Or you were right.

32:42.503 --> 32:44.464
Kid got better
when we put him on steroids.

32:44.589 --> 32:46.716
This is JRA and
it's under control now.

32:46.841 --> 32:49.260
Or the steroids
have just tempered his condition.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.429
He got a haircut,
but he's still got bad hair.

32:51.554 --> 32:52.388
What about Lyme disease?

32:52.513 --> 32:55.558
It explains everything,
the heart issues, the internal bleeding,

32:55.683 --> 32:57.101
even why he'd get
better on steroids.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.646
On the other hand,
if he has Lyme disease,

32:59.771 --> 33:03.232
there'd be other subtle clues
like a huge target-shaped rash.

33:03.358 --> 33:04.484
But thanks for playing.

33:04.609 --> 33:06.736
Why can't you just
accept the fact that you cured this kid?

33:06.861 --> 33:09.197
You want to
stop his surgery!

33:09.572 --> 33:11.240
You're not normal.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.534
So you don't want anyone
also to be normal.

33:13.660 --> 33:15.662
You don't think
normal's healthy.

33:22.669 --> 33:23.878
Could be rheumatic fever.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.588
Also explains why
the steroids helped.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.131
It's a similar
inflammatory disease.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.175
Rheumatic fever
doesn't explain liver failure.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.010
Taub thinks that
acetaminophen does.

33:31.135 --> 33:32.595
TAUB: Fine.
Let's test your theory.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.013
Remove his pacing wire.

33:34.138 --> 33:36.516
If he's better,
his heart will be just fine on its own

33:36.641 --> 33:39.227
and then he can have
his operation.

33:40.687 --> 33:43.439
If I'm right,
his heart will stop.

33:44.982 --> 33:47.568
Kutner, have the
paddles on standby.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.113
Another chance
to blow someone up.

33:51.322 --> 33:53.199
There'll be
some minor discomfort

33:53.324 --> 33:56.327
and you'll feel a slow,
steady pulling sensation.

33:56.452 --> 33:58.121
Are you sure his heart
is ready for this?

33:58.371 --> 33:59.622
HOUSE: Absolutely.

33:59.747 --> 34:01.999
He's convinced he's sure.

34:02.125 --> 34:04.794
Whereas I care
about your son,

34:05.712 --> 34:09.632
and have therefore brought
a professional defibrillist.

34:12.510 --> 34:14.762
We're not gonna need those.

34:16.222 --> 34:20.143
Dad, I feel fine, and my finger
hasn't moved in a while.

34:24.731 --> 34:27.650
Okay. Take him off.

34:28.276 --> 34:29.777
Here we go.

34:51.591 --> 34:55.261
Heart rates 85 beats
per minute. BP 110 over 70.

34:55.386 --> 34:56.637
Is he okay?

34:57.221 --> 34:58.681
I feel the same.

35:00.641 --> 35:02.894
He's fine. You're fine.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.521
Thank God!

35:06.522 --> 35:08.316
HOUSE:
What do you mean, thank God?

35:08.441 --> 35:10.651
God's the guy
who gave it to him.

35:17.575 --> 35:20.578
Thank you. Thank you.

36:10.044 --> 36:11.587
DARNELL: Can you tell us
about the procedure?

36:11.712 --> 36:15.049
We have to use both an extra
and intracranial approach

36:15.174 --> 36:18.553
to get enough exposure
to reduce the encephalocele cyst

36:18.678 --> 36:20.596
and do the bony
reconstruction.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.559
And how are you
participating in this procedure?

36:24.934 --> 36:26.269
She's not.

36:27.478 --> 36:30.648
They don't want me here because they
think the kid's cured. I don't.

36:30.773 --> 36:32.692
DARNELL:
And what do you think the problem is?

36:32.817 --> 36:34.277
I wish I knew.

36:34.402 --> 36:37.446
I just know that if Dr. House is right,
something's gonna go wrong.

36:37.697 --> 36:40.283
Dr. House doesn't
think he's right.

36:40.408 --> 36:43.202
Well, then I'll just
waste a few hours watching a surgery.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.580
See, the danger is,
we have to reconstruct

36:45.705 --> 36:47.832
all the way down
to the cranial base,

36:48.040 --> 36:50.418
and there are some
big vessels down there.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.420
So, what we'll do
is we'll work our way down to here...

36:52.545 --> 36:55.172
When were
these pictures taken?

36:55.298 --> 36:58.384
Well, about three weeks ago.
Why? What do you see?

36:58.509 --> 37:00.428
Well, the acanthosis
nigricans was already there.

37:00.553 --> 37:04.557
It's been there a lot longer than that,
probably his whole life.

37:04.682 --> 37:06.559
What about around
his hairline?

37:07.184 --> 37:08.936
What?
There's no discoloration.

37:09.061 --> 37:10.563
There is now.

37:19.572 --> 37:21.616
I have a new theory.

37:21.949 --> 37:25.494
Their bad ideas don't indicate
a lack of intelligence,

37:25.620 --> 37:27.455
they indicate
an open mind.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.250
The willingness
not to be trapped by conventional...

37:31.584 --> 37:32.752
You've got a problem.

37:32.877 --> 37:34.128
Tell me something
I don't know.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.548
You hire beautiful girls, enslave them,
force them to be around you

37:37.673 --> 37:39.550
because you don't know
how to have an actual relationship.

37:39.675 --> 37:43.262
If they're qualified, keep them.
If not, fire them and ask them out.

37:43.512 --> 37:46.724
You do realize that, "Tell me something
I don't know" is just an expression?

37:47.183 --> 37:48.643
- Thirteen...
- You think that just because

37:48.851 --> 37:50.144
she is as beautiful, ergo,

37:50.269 --> 37:51.812
you think that because she
hasn't had a decent idea...

37:51.979 --> 37:55.399
No. My point is she's about to enter
your office, so you should shut up.

37:57.902 --> 37:59.654
You were right
about the diagnosis.

38:00.279 --> 38:02.531
Yes, it was JRA.
I'm very proud.

38:02.657 --> 38:04.825
No, I mean you were right about
being wrong. He's got Lyme disease.

38:04.951 --> 38:07.078
It explains everything.

38:07.703 --> 38:12.041
Could you just hold up some fingers
so I can see if I'm literally blind?

38:12.166 --> 38:14.293
We ruled out
Lyme disease hours ago.

38:14.418 --> 38:15.419
All the symptoms fit.

38:15.544 --> 38:16.545
I am so ashamed.

38:16.671 --> 38:17.630
Is she really
that good looking?

38:18.047 --> 38:18.881
Apparently.

38:19.006 --> 38:21.008
How many lives have been lost
because of pretty girls?

38:21.133 --> 38:23.094
The target rash is hiding.

38:23.219 --> 38:26.138
No one ever looked at
him closely enough.

38:44.865 --> 38:46.242
(BUZZING)

39:05.803 --> 39:08.556
She's getting uglier
by the second.

39:09.390 --> 39:11.225
We can try and pretend
we're above it

39:11.392 --> 39:12.893
and we can try
and intellectualize it away,

39:13.019 --> 39:16.480
but ultimately, shiny, pretty,
perky things are good

39:17.314 --> 39:21.986
and ugly, misshapen,
teenage boys are repulsive.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.407
DARNELL: The question
was, do you resent

39:26.532 --> 39:29.368
Dr. Cuddy's interference
in your practice?

39:30.202 --> 39:31.328
Oh.

39:32.371 --> 39:35.374
Well, then I guess my answer
wasn't very helpful, was it?

39:44.133 --> 39:46.552
"Mini-stud", stand up.

39:53.392 --> 39:54.769
I spoke to
your other partner.

39:55.019 --> 39:55.853
After Cuddy told you...

39:55.978 --> 39:58.064
No, I stayed away.
Did it all over the phone.

39:58.272 --> 40:01.275
I asked for a reference. Said you were
applying for a plastic surgery job.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.651
Oh, God!

40:02.777 --> 40:03.736
Yeah.

40:04.737 --> 40:08.324
He went nuts.
Apparently you signed a non-compete.

40:08.699 --> 40:09.825
Now, why would
you agree to that?

40:09.950 --> 40:11.660
I don't wanna practice
plastic surgery.

40:11.827 --> 40:14.663
You sign a contract
because someone's making you.

40:14.789 --> 40:16.082
Someone's getting
something from you.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.292
What did they give you
in return?

40:20.169 --> 40:22.046
They agreed to keep
their mouths shut.

40:22.171 --> 40:26.133
So you gave up your chosen career
just so they'd be quiet?

40:29.386 --> 40:31.222
I love my wife.

40:36.852 --> 40:40.481
You risked this job
with nothing to fall back on.

40:42.066 --> 40:44.068
I thought you were wrong.

40:49.198 --> 40:50.658
Sit back down.

40:52.368 --> 40:53.994
You're keeping him
because he's a philanderer?

40:54.120 --> 40:55.121
Where do I sign up?

40:55.287 --> 40:58.999
Ask the Mormon. I'm keeping him
because he's interesting.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.170
Dr. Terzi, would you
please stand up?

41:10.427 --> 41:11.470
Nice.

41:12.721 --> 41:15.015
I have treated you unfairly.

41:15.683 --> 41:17.309
Pre-judged you.

41:18.894 --> 41:20.187
And for me
to be a better person,

41:20.312 --> 41:23.107
I have to
rectify that situation.

41:23.232 --> 41:24.400
You're fired.

41:30.531 --> 41:32.825
You wanna grab some dinner?

41:33.325 --> 41:34.743
Maybe a movie?

41:36.412 --> 41:37.788
Seriously.

41:51.051 --> 41:53.637
Just days ago, with Kenny's
condition worsening,

41:53.762 --> 41:57.349
it was Dr. Gregory House
reassuring Kenny and his father.

41:58.142 --> 41:59.852
I care about your son.

41:59.977 --> 42:02.855
DARNELL: The charming House,
who happens to be a film buff

42:02.980 --> 42:06.233
with a soft spot in his heart for
children told us how he got his start.

42:06.358 --> 42:08.777
See, I became a doctor
because of the movie, Patch Adams.

42:09.195 --> 42:11.739
DARNELL: Determined to save
the boy's life, as well as...

42:11.864 --> 42:13.532
The horror.

42:13.949 --> 42:16.410
Well, it's nice of them
to send us an early copy.

42:16.619 --> 42:18.871
Not so much sent
as stolen.

42:19.413 --> 42:23.375
DARNELL: It was Dr. Gregory
House who served as not only a doctor,

42:23.500 --> 42:25.586
but a rock for Kenny
and his father.

42:25.836 --> 42:28.964
You're putting your trust in someone
who does think the surgery's important.

42:29.089 --> 42:30.841
DARNELL: House, one of
those rare doctors...

42:30.966 --> 42:32.092
God!

42:32.218 --> 42:33.719
...who wears his heart
on his sleeve.

42:34.595 --> 42:37.181
I was saying
that was a stupid thing to do!

42:37.348 --> 42:38.933
It's difficult
not to be moved.

42:39.058 --> 42:40.351
Oh, stop it.

42:40.476 --> 42:43.938
Suddenly, I don't feel I can
trust Michael Moore movies.

42:44.396 --> 42:45.522
Where are you going?

42:45.648 --> 42:49.109
Kittens to get out of trees?
Deaf kids to read to?

42:49.235 --> 42:53.822
I owe it to the world to make sure this
evil never sees the light of day.

42:58.285 --> 43:00.287
DARNELL:
ls there anything else?

43:02.581 --> 43:03.749
(SIGHS)

43:03.874 --> 43:05.626
Thank you, Dr. House.

43:07.127 --> 43:08.420
Thank you.
