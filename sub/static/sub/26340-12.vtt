WEBVTT

00:08.842 --> 00:10.711
Charlie, I want my wok back!

00:10.744 --> 00:12.713
You borrowed it months ago.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.048
It's time.

00:14.082 --> 00:16.016
It's just time.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.751
You lent something to him?

00:17.785 --> 00:19.653
This man's a crazy hoarder.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.190
Crazy good at it.

00:22.223 --> 00:23.524
WOMAN:
Ugh.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.359
Is this cake up for grabs?

00:25.393 --> 00:27.995
Because I have been on a bus
for 12 hours,

00:28.028 --> 00:30.030
and I am starving.
(chuckles)

00:30.064 --> 00:34.268
I was saving that for after
I finished my veggies.

00:34.302 --> 00:37.037
-Excuse me, miss? Miss?
-Hmm?

00:37.071 --> 00:39.740
Who are you and what are you
doing at our table?

00:39.773 --> 00:42.210
(chuckles)
Your table?

00:42.243 --> 00:44.445
What makes it your table?

00:44.478 --> 00:46.447
Well, the fact that it is.

00:46.480 --> 00:49.950
Because we say it is,
so then it is.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.753
Well, I didn't know.
I'm so sorry.

00:52.786 --> 00:53.921
In that case...

00:56.657 --> 00:58.892
That seat is saved.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.428
(chuckling):
Saved seats?

01:00.461 --> 01:01.962
What is this, middle school?

01:01.995 --> 01:04.698
Do I look like
I'm in middle school?

01:04.732 --> 01:06.900
Do you really want me
to answer that?

01:09.803 --> 01:12.240
You can't just sit at a seat
that doesn't belong to you,

01:12.273 --> 01:13.541
then act like you
run this place.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.808
I mean, who does that?

01:14.842 --> 01:16.210
MJ!

01:16.244 --> 01:17.811
Mom!

01:17.845 --> 01:19.447
(both squealing)

01:19.480 --> 01:21.515
ALL:
Oh.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.253
*

01:45.206 --> 01:46.907
Then Michael breaks up with me,

01:46.940 --> 01:49.677
kicks me out of my house
and changes all the locks.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.413
And the police are like, "Duh,
we can't do anything about it."

01:52.446 --> 01:53.914
Just because Michael
was the homeowner

01:53.947 --> 01:55.649
and I never paid any rent.

01:55.683 --> 01:56.917
Unbelievable.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.187
Is it, though?

01:59.220 --> 02:00.688
So, what happened
with you and Michael?

02:00.721 --> 02:02.423
I thought you guys
were doing great.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.792
Well, so did I.
And then he was like,

02:04.825 --> 02:08.262
"Duh, you need to get a job
so you can make some money."

02:08.296 --> 02:11.131
Boyfriend sounds a lot
like the policeman.

02:11.165 --> 02:14.168
So, I start doing
my ice sculptures again.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.204
And then he's like, "Uh,
there's puddles everywhere."

02:16.237 --> 02:17.971
And I'm like, "Yeah.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.474
"That's what happens when
I don't sell an ice sculpture.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.310
"It turns into a puddle.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.945
That's how molecules work."

02:24.978 --> 02:28.048
Does he want you to work or not?
Make up your mind, Michael.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.218
Right? Thank you.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.052
Margaret, you don't have to
play nice for us.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.054
If you want to whup
this woman's ass, go ahead.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.356
We'll look the other way.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.728
Ignore him.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.464
Anyway, Mom, I was hoping
I could stay with you

02:43.497 --> 02:45.999
just for a little bit,
till I get back on my feet.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.802
You can stay here
as long as you need. (chuckles)

02:48.836 --> 02:50.738
Aw, thanks, chica.
You rule.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.241
Um... all right, well,
I am gonna go and get my stuff.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.343
Hey, any way I could get
one of your famous

02:55.376 --> 02:56.910
grilled cheeses tonight?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.680
Oh, I would, but I don't think
I have any cheese.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.683
Okay. Well, if you're going to
the store, I would not be mad

03:02.716 --> 03:04.318
at one of those
rotisserie chickens, either.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.587
Oh. All right, well,
I guess I could squeeze in

03:06.620 --> 03:08.155
a quick trip to the market.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.591
If I hustle, I can still catch
that 5:15 bus.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.493
-Mm.
-Oh, and, uh, when I get back,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.395
I will make up the couch
for you.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.165
Oh.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.100
The couch.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.937
Okay.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.377
Who is this person?

03:29.410 --> 03:31.712
That's my daughter, Hank.
Try to keep up.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.113
I'm talking about you!

03:33.146 --> 03:34.915
I've never seen such a doormat.

03:34.948 --> 03:38.952
Are you gonna question
my relationship with my kid?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.220
Guys, back me up here.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.590
-No, not a chance.
-No...

03:42.623 --> 03:46.026
You know, MJ's dad and I got
divorced when she was little,

03:46.059 --> 03:47.395
and she took it very hard.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.196
So I'm always gonna be there
for her.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.565
Mm-hmm. Doormat.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.402
I am not a doormat.
I'm a mom.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.737
Yeah, well, somebody's sleeping
on the couch tonight,

03:56.770 --> 03:58.606
and I bet it's gonna be you.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.040
Butt out, Hank.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.743
It's not easy being right
all the time!

04:02.776 --> 04:04.945
It's hard on me, too!

04:09.683 --> 04:13.621
And you thought it would be hard
to find your wok.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.656
Your hoarding has gotten
so much worse

04:15.689 --> 04:17.425
since last time I was here.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.660
Hoarding never gets worse, Sid.

04:19.693 --> 04:21.762
It only gets better.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.798
This has been a problem
for years.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.067
But now it's affecting me

04:27.100 --> 04:31.171
and my ability to cook
delicious Chinese food.

04:31.204 --> 04:34.475
-And why do you have a canoe?
-Oh.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.144
Oh, it was left to me
by an Inuit elder in his will.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.112
My good friend Tulugaak.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.514
Oh, yeah.

04:40.548 --> 04:43.717
Well, that's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

04:45.185 --> 04:48.021
May not seem obvious,
all of my belongings are

04:48.055 --> 04:49.623
very carefully organized.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.359
Organized? By what?

04:51.392 --> 04:53.494
By the letters in the word
"organized."

04:53.527 --> 04:55.262
This is section "O."

04:55.295 --> 04:58.332
There's oranges and, uh,
office supplies, origami.

04:58.366 --> 05:01.134
But what about letters that
aren't in the word "organized"?

05:01.168 --> 05:03.437
Exactly.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.205
Now, "wok" would've been
under "O"

05:05.238 --> 05:06.840
because there's an "O" in "wok,"

05:06.874 --> 05:09.209
but I didn't think of it
as a wok.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.144
I thought of it as
a cereal bowl.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.449
Obviously, there's no "C"
in "organized," either.

05:15.483 --> 05:17.618
So that's when it starts to get
really complicated.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.853
Charlie, I'm gonna
help you out here.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.188
Okay.

05:21.221 --> 05:23.624
You are dating
a beautiful woman now.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.693
You cannot bring her back here.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.995
And I don't want you to wind up
one of those guys

05:28.028 --> 05:29.663
who gets eaten by their cats.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.465
I don't have cats.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.833
How do you know?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.138
Thanks for letting me
stay here, Mom.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.507
You're always there for me.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.375
And I would much rather
hang out with you

05:41.409 --> 05:42.876
than Dad and Blah-Blah.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.178
Oh, don't be so hard on Barbara.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.914
She has to live
with your father.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.249
She's got it bad enough.
(chuckles)

05:49.282 --> 05:52.586
She does suck ass, though,
doesn't she? (laughing)

05:52.620 --> 05:57.525
I mean, she puts out raisins
like they're a snack. Raisins.

05:57.558 --> 06:01.562
You sleep well, and, uh, things
will feel better in the morning.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.599
(whimpering)

06:05.633 --> 06:07.234
What's the matter, honey?

06:07.267 --> 06:08.669
Well, it's just...

06:08.702 --> 06:10.838
You know that you can
tell me anything.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.773
I was in the middle
of telling you.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.044
It's just, when Michael
broke up with me,

06:17.077 --> 06:18.612
he made me sleep on the couch,

06:18.646 --> 06:20.948
so this is super triggering
for me.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.684
Well, hey, we can
take care of this.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.286
I'll sleep on the sofa,
you take the bed, okay?

06:26.319 --> 06:28.221
-Is that better?
-Yep.

06:29.757 --> 06:33.026
I am jealous of the sleep
you're about to get.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.295
(chuckles)
I mean... (sighs)

06:35.328 --> 06:39.032
the couch is all warm
from our butts.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.434
(chuckles) If you'd rather
sleep out here, I...

06:40.468 --> 06:42.135
Good night, Mom.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.139
(sighs):
Oh, stupid Hank.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.975
I'm a doormat?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.077
Doormats go on the floor.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.946
I am up on the sofa, so...

06:52.980 --> 06:55.683
MJ:
Trying to sleep in here!

07:06.527 --> 07:07.995
I knew it.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.664
Your couch face.

07:10.698 --> 07:13.767
Your creasy-corduroy-couch face.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.503
You slept on the sofa
last night,

07:15.536 --> 07:17.771
just like I said you would,
didn't you?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.306
Doormat.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.808
(singsongy): Doormat.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.143
I am not a doormat.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.346
So what if I slept on the couch?
You don't get it, Hank.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.783
This is a mother-daughter thing,
and when she needs me, I melt.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.184
Yeah, well,
that does her no good.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.352
You're a parent.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.754
You're not supposed to melt.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.355
You're not one of
her ice sculptures.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.090
You got to be something
that doesn't melt,

07:37.124 --> 07:38.358
like, uh, steel.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.028
No. No, steel melts.

07:41.061 --> 07:42.596
Or, uh, chocolate.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.364
Damn, that melts, too.

07:44.397 --> 07:46.366
Why can't I think of something
that doesn't melt?

07:46.399 --> 07:47.935
Don't worry about it, Hank.
I get the point.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.171
My God, does everything melt?

07:51.204 --> 07:53.373
Geez, Hank. Wood.
How about wood?

07:53.406 --> 07:55.208
Yeah, Margaret, be wood.

07:55.242 --> 07:59.613
Be as inflexible and strong
as a big ol' hunk of wood.

07:59.647 --> 08:01.515
I ain't talking about
a twig, neither.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.116
I'm talking about wood.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.819
Not balsa wood or pine.

08:05.853 --> 08:10.524
I'm talking about maple
or oak or petrified wood.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.693
All right, Hank, I've got it!

08:14.094 --> 08:16.029
And what do you care
about it, anyway?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.465
'Cause I had a mother
that was just like you.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.302
Let me walk all over her.
Took me forever to grow up.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.505
Cost me relationships, jobs.

08:25.539 --> 08:29.009
And you're not gonna believe
this, but most of my life,

08:29.042 --> 08:32.479
I was kind of a jerk.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.549
I'm so glad those days
are behind you, Hank.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.851
Look, I know my daughter.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.687
The direct approach
does not work with her.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.355
I'm gonna get my bed back,
but I'm gonna do it my way.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.158
Let me guess.
You're gonna race her to bed

08:45.192 --> 08:48.395
and act like you're tired...
and fake-yawn?

08:48.428 --> 08:50.564
Margaret.

08:50.598 --> 08:53.934
Please tell me you're not gonna
go up in there

08:53.967 --> 08:55.836
-with no fake yawn.
-Oh, you know what?

08:55.869 --> 08:57.871
I don't need this.
I've got something

08:57.905 --> 09:00.708
a little more advanced
up my sleeve, thank you.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.309
Mm-hmm.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.246
Wait a minute.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.548
Wood burns.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.985
This world wasn't built to last.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.056
I'm trying to help you
here, Charlie.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.759
You have to get rid
of something.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.728
Let's do a lightning round.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.631
How about this canister
of blue gel for barber combs?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.834
Keep.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.739
A photo album of a random
Filipino family?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.106
Keep.

09:33.140 --> 09:36.777
Come on, Charlie!
This is all trash.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.545
No, this is not trash.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.749
This is a rich treasure trove
of memories

09:41.782 --> 09:43.550
collected over a lifetime.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.954
This hacky sack was in my pocket

09:46.987 --> 09:51.391
when I saw Sophia Loren
at the mall in 1988.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.626
There are no beans in it.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.562
No one can hack that sack!

09:55.595 --> 09:57.965
This is not about the object.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.834
This is about the way
it makes you feel.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.070
The way it takes you to a place

10:03.103 --> 10:05.305
where you yearn to go again.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.207
The mall?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.945
Sid, you don't get it.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.315
(chuckles)
This is a time machine.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.484
All these things are.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.120
I like knowing that I can
time-travel through my life

10:20.153 --> 10:21.822
whenever I want.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.525
I don't keep anything.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.963
I have thrown away so many

10:29.997 --> 10:32.532
of my own time machines.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.202
A busted Daffy Duck watch here,

10:35.235 --> 10:38.338
a chipped rhinestone
belt buckle there.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.842
And now it's just too late.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.178
No, it isn't.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.648
Um... here.

10:50.684 --> 10:54.554
It's a time machine
to this very moment.

10:54.587 --> 10:57.190
Well, thank you.

10:57.224 --> 11:01.261
Thus begins my first hoard.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.803
(strained):
Never mind.

11:09.837 --> 11:14.074
Your memories
are crushing my friggin' neck.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.419
(loud, forced yawn)

11:27.554 --> 11:28.922
What was that?

11:28.956 --> 11:32.325
That was a... that was a yawn.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.328
(loud, forced yawn)

11:35.362 --> 11:37.230
So tired.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.266
I'm going to, uh...
I'm gonna go to sleep.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.700
You probably want to stay up

11:40.734 --> 11:42.602
and watch TV
for a little while longer,

11:42.635 --> 11:45.572
so, uh, maybe you should just,
uh, take the couch.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.741
And that will leave me

11:47.775 --> 11:50.410
with the... bed.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.080
* I'm gonna be in my bed *

11:53.113 --> 11:55.448
* I'm gonna
be in my bed *

11:55.482 --> 11:57.217
* Bed, bed, bed. *

11:57.250 --> 11:58.551
Night.

11:58.585 --> 12:00.120
Mom.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.122
(scoffs)
If you want your bed back,

12:02.155 --> 12:04.224
you should just ask me,
you big weirdo.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.959
Oh, that would be great.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.260
If there's anything
that you need from me,

12:07.294 --> 12:08.762
you know I'll give it to you.

12:08.796 --> 12:10.463
That's what we're like
with each other.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.900
Which reminds me...

12:12.933 --> 12:14.601
No.

12:14.634 --> 12:16.203
It's stupid.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.038
What is it, sweetie?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.374
Well, a friend of mine
just told me about this studio

12:21.408 --> 12:22.776
that opened in her building,

12:22.810 --> 12:24.444
but I need a little cash
for a down payment.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.946
Okay. How much?

12:25.979 --> 12:29.282
-$1,800, but I'd totally
pay you back.
-Oh...

12:29.316 --> 12:31.251
That's a lot
of money for me, MJ.

12:31.284 --> 12:34.087
I know. I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have even asked you.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.289
-I'll ask Dad and Barbara.
-Uh...

12:36.323 --> 12:39.059
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Look.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.262
I am gonna go sleep in my bed,
and we'll talk about this

12:42.295 --> 12:44.264
in the morning
and we'll figure it all out.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.498
Okay, well, I'm obviously
crowding you,

12:45.532 --> 12:47.000
so I'll just go stay with them.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.269
No, I'm not saying
that you should go.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.504
I'm just saying
you should sleep on the couch.

12:51.538 --> 12:55.142
Okay, well, I'm having a hard
time seeing the difference.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.978
Come on.
You don't even like Blah-Blah.

12:58.011 --> 13:01.815
Her name is Barbara, Mom.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.984
(quietly):
Barbara.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.354
All right, you take the bed.
I will give you the money.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.756
-I just need to find
my checkbook.
-I'll help you look.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.192
Oh, look, there it is,
on the table right there.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.994
With a pen next to it.

13:15.863 --> 13:18.465
Oh, look, you filled it out
and everything.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.600
Yeah. All you have to do
is sign right there.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.801
(laughs)

13:21.835 --> 13:24.537
Okay.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.007
Thanks, chica.

13:31.845 --> 13:35.582
Wait, what the hell
just happened?

13:42.322 --> 13:44.791
I know it's late, but I...

13:44.824 --> 13:47.127
I really need something
from you.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.231
Well, well, well.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.566
I knew this was gonna happen

13:53.600 --> 13:55.402
one of these lonely nights.

13:57.604 --> 14:00.073
But, girl, no.

14:00.107 --> 14:02.976
-What?
-You know, next time,

14:03.010 --> 14:04.844
you should start
with a "You up?" text.

14:04.878 --> 14:07.347
See, that way, you don't have to
face this humiliation in person.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.183
(chuckles)
Things are not that bad.

14:10.217 --> 14:13.820
Things will never be that bad.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.224
No, I'm here to tell you
that you were right

14:17.257 --> 14:20.260
and... I need your advice.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.430
Well, in that case,
welcome to Hank's.

14:36.076 --> 14:39.112
Just so I'm 100% correct
on this,

14:39.146 --> 14:41.448
you said I was right

14:41.481 --> 14:43.350
and that you need my advice?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.752
Can you say that again
into my phone

14:45.785 --> 14:47.921
so I got it on record?

14:47.955 --> 14:49.622
How long are you gonna
milk this?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.358
Well, at least
a couple of weeks.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.493
Hey, I'm the milkman, baby.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
All right.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.532
So, how bad is it?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.401
It's pretty bad.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.303
Well, you didn't give her
any money, did you?

15:04.938 --> 15:07.574
Well, tell me
it was less than $100.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.875
(whimpers softly)

15:08.908 --> 15:10.277
-Two?
-(whimpers)

15:10.310 --> 15:12.279
Oh, no.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.148
Did you give her $500?

15:15.182 --> 15:17.417
1,800.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.719
$1,800?!

15:19.752 --> 15:23.656
Ooh, I got to stand up
and pace on that.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.393
Ooh-wee!

15:26.426 --> 15:29.229
You gave a homeless ice sculptor

15:29.262 --> 15:33.833
enough money to buy
a '93 Pontiac Sunfire?

15:33.866 --> 15:37.104
Yes. I know, I screwed up.
You were right.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.473
I need to be wood.
I don't know how to be wood.

15:40.507 --> 15:43.810
Well, good thing
you came to the woodshop.

15:43.843 --> 15:47.247
The milkman works
at the woodshop?

15:47.280 --> 15:48.681
Yep.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.651
All right.

15:51.684 --> 15:55.255
Margaret, you need to give
your daughter some tough love.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.257
And it's 30 years overdue.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.292
I know. I'm just concerned
about how she's gonna react,

15:59.326 --> 16:00.927
and I don't want
to push her away.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.096
Well, that's why
it's called tough love.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.265
You've been doing
what's easiest for Margaret.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.867
Now you got to do
what's best for MJ.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.836
I don't know if I can.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.671
I'll go with you, then.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.442
You want to put
some pants on first?

16:15.475 --> 16:17.910
Tough love don't wear pants.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.380
SID:
Help me!

16:20.413 --> 16:22.382
Get me out of here!

16:22.415 --> 16:25.618
Just hold on, buddy.
I'm moving as fast as I can.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.354
Oh.
(laughs)

16:27.387 --> 16:29.889
The key to my 13th apartment.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.325
You know, there's a funny story
that goes with this, Sid.

16:32.359 --> 16:35.895
-Charlie!
-No, you're-you're gonna
want to hear this.

16:35.928 --> 16:37.664
It's got a monkey in it.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.067
Oh, shut up and start digging.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.901
I'm claustrophobic.
(shrieks)

16:41.934 --> 16:45.538
And I'm not sure
I'm alone in here.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.740
Okay. Well, hold on.
I'll get you out.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.009
Oh, there's a hand.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.913
Oh, that's not good.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.183
(grunting, gasping)

16:56.216 --> 16:58.985
Oh, I can breathe again.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.589
Charlie, I could have
died in there.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.058
I got little bitty lungs.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.061
(panting)

17:11.531 --> 17:13.200
(groans)

17:15.268 --> 17:17.070
I'm so sorry, Sid.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.905
I'm glad you're okay.

17:18.938 --> 17:21.741
Did you ever think that instead
of collecting this crap,

17:21.774 --> 17:24.944
you should be out there
living in the present?

17:24.977 --> 17:28.014
Do you know how many new
memories you've missed making

17:28.047 --> 17:31.118
while you're in here
organizing your old ones?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.420
(exhales)
You're right.

17:33.453 --> 17:35.122
I should get rid of some stuff.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.857
I am so happy
to hear you say that.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.494
But before you do, I'm gonna
need that monkey story.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.498
Does it smoke a cigarette?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.536
-(door opens)
-Now, look here, little girl,

17:49.569 --> 17:51.771
you gonna sit down,
and you gonna listen

17:51.804 --> 17:53.640
to what your mama's got to say.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.643
I'm already sitting down.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.211
(chuckling):
Mom, what is this?

17:58.245 --> 18:01.047
I'm here to be wood.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.283
-What?
-I love you, MJ,

18:03.316 --> 18:04.817
but you got
to sleep on the couch,

18:04.851 --> 18:06.619
and you've got
to give me back that money.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.122
Well, it doesn't sound
like you love me at all.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.525
Don't fall for it, Margaret.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.661
What is he doing here?

18:14.694 --> 18:15.928
Is this your boyfriend, Mom?

18:15.962 --> 18:18.165
Because you could do
so much better.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.666
What? Excuse me?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.768
Don't change the subject, MJ.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.069
The subject is you.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.937
Yeah, and how you a loser!

18:24.971 --> 18:26.973
Don't call my daughter a loser.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.608
I can call my daughter
a loser.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.310
You cannot call her a loser.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.612
You're calling me a loser
two days after I got dumped?

18:32.645 --> 18:35.848
That is so mean.
No wonder Dad left you.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.585
Ooh, damn.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.920
Is that really
where you want to take this?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.255
HANK:
You know what? I just

18:42.289 --> 18:43.923
came here
to get the ball rolling.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.492
The ball is rolling,
so let me just ease...

18:45.525 --> 18:48.661
It's not gonna work anymore, MJ.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.364
I'm done feeling guilty
about the divorce,

18:51.398 --> 18:53.633
so quit holding it against me,
and quit holding it

18:53.666 --> 18:56.269
against your dumb,
stupid, idiot father.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.104
Look, I'm-a wait this out
in the bathroom.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.506
Margaret, what's your Wi-Fi?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.441
You are an adult now, MJ.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.176
It's time to grow up.

19:03.210 --> 19:05.111
It's time to get a real job.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.180
It's time to take
some responsibility

19:07.214 --> 19:09.482
for your own damn life.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.818
I'm leaving.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.992
Well, I'm glad I could
help you out with your daughter.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.530
(loud, forced yawn)

19:24.997 --> 19:27.534
I'm gonna just...
I'm tired. Ooh.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.977
Still no word from MJ.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.247
I've called
every ice dealer in town.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.081
I guess you'll know she's
all right when the check clears.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.551
(laughs)

19:44.584 --> 19:48.020
It's too soon for a joke.
I realize that now.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.224
Good news, Sid.
I found your wok.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.159
You're gonna want
to rinse it off.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.995
Oh, I'm so proud of you, buddy.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.331
You got rid of all your stuff.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.200
Uh, I didn't say "all,"
but I whittled it down

20:01.234 --> 20:04.604
to a few thousand
of my most precious memories.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.739
Couldn't have done it
without you.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.241
HANK:
You know, I usually

20:08.275 --> 20:10.577
don't take things
in this direction, but...

20:10.610 --> 20:12.812
hoarders are always
white people.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.048
Black people don't hoard.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.017
Hey.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.120
Hey.
I thought you left.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.190
Nah, I slept in an old canoe
someone left outside.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.693
Forgive me, Tulugaak.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.528
I just wanted to give you
your money back.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.864
I decided I should figure
some things out on my own,

20:31.898 --> 20:33.766
so I made some calls, and...

20:33.800 --> 20:35.768
it looks like Stephanie
needs a roommate

20:35.802 --> 20:39.472
and Cynthia needs a receptionist
at her hair salon, so I'm good.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.974
Well, MJ, this is great.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.143
Nah, it's lame,
but I guess it's time

20:44.176 --> 20:47.447
I move on from ice sculptures.
They just melt.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.417
Everything does.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.919
You know, everything you said
to me really sucked, Mom,

20:52.952 --> 20:56.889
but I kind of needed to hear it.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.559
Thanks. I love you.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.728
I love you, too, sweetie.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.229

21:03.262 --> 21:05.465
Well, I'm off.
(chuckles)

21:05.498 --> 21:08.401
-Bye-bye, MJ. Nice meeting you.
-Bye, MJ.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.303
Bye, Margaret Jr.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.474
You named your daughter
Margaret Jr.?

21:14.507 --> 21:16.843
No wonder she's so messed up.

21:16.876 --> 21:20.447
Wow, I can't believe it.
I finally got through to her.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.149
This is really great, Margaret.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.117
Your 35-year-old daughter

21:25.151 --> 21:28.154
might be getting a job.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.856
Kudos!

21:31.290 --> 21:32.291
That's pretty good.
