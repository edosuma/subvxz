00:01.500 --> 00:04.333
[ominous music]

00:25.167 --> 00:28.167
Am I going to die?

00:28.250 --> 00:33.458
If it is written in the streams
of time, Shon, it will be so.

00:33.542 --> 00:36.417
(Franklin)
'I'll tell you what is written
in the streams of time.'

00:36.500 --> 00:39.208
Very soon,
you will breathe much easier.

00:39.292 --> 00:41.417
And then you will grow up to be
strong and wise

00:41.500 --> 00:44.667
and bring much honor
to your mother and your father.

00:44.750 --> 00:47.292
(female #1)
'Please don't speak that way.'

00:47.375 --> 00:49.167
No one knows what is written
in the stream

00:49.250 --> 00:51.042
until the waters surround him.

00:56.042 --> 00:58.167
I am never wrong
about these things.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.750
Dr. Franklin.

01:07.542 --> 01:11.167
My husband would like to speak
with you candidly. May he do so?

01:12.833 --> 01:13.917
Of course.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.375
(male #1)
'The doctors on our world say
that there's no treatment'

01:21.458 --> 01:24.125
for his watery breathing.

01:25.750 --> 01:29.500
They say that the boy is weak
and that he will die.

01:29.583 --> 01:32.792
He's our only son, Dr. Franklin.

01:32.875 --> 01:36.000
He is the last chance
for our family's honor

01:36.083 --> 01:38.625
to fly on the winds of history.

01:38.708 --> 01:40.250
You must love him very much.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.542
On my world, it would be
a sign of weakness

01:42.625 --> 01:47.708
for me to acknowledge feelings
to a stranger.

01:47.792 --> 01:53.333
But he brought such joy
and happiness into our lives.

01:55.750 --> 01:56.833
Can you save him?

01:56.917 --> 02:00.000
Shon's condition
is very serious

02:00.083 --> 02:01.583
but it is treatable.

02:01.667 --> 02:04.667
He has a congestive blockage
in his upper air passages.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.708
It's not uncommon in species

02:06.792 --> 02:08.875
with internal air bladders
like yours.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.458
(Maya)
'We've seen this before.'

02:10.542 --> 02:12.083
Usually it happens as a result

02:12.167 --> 02:15.792
of an infection
or a reaction to an injury.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.750
It's a normal response.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.500
'Usually it clears up by itself
but sometimes..'

02:20.583 --> 02:24.917
Sometimes the mass hardens,
or grows.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.292
It's not a sign of weakness.
It could happen to anyone.

02:28.375 --> 02:31.708
A simple operation will easily
correct the condition.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.083
Operation?

02:35.125 --> 02:36.625
Surgery.

02:36.708 --> 02:39.792
You will cut him open?

02:39.875 --> 02:43.583
Well, that's usually what
surgery entails, yes.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.958
'There's nothing
to worry about though.'

02:46.042 --> 02:48.083
Get Shon.
We will find no help here.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.583
Thank you, Dr. Franklin.

02:49.667 --> 02:50.958
'Sorry to have taken so much
of your time.'

02:51.042 --> 02:53.083
Well, now, wait, wait. It-it..

02:53.167 --> 02:55.083
Look, it's a simple procedure.

02:55.167 --> 02:57.542
Afterwards,
he'll be stronger than ever.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.000
You don't understand.

02:59.083 --> 03:01.958
Food animals are cut open.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.875
They don't have a soul,
so it's alright.

03:03.958 --> 03:08.583
But the chosen of God
may not be punctured.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.125
The blockage
won't heal by itself.

03:11.208 --> 03:12.708
If Shon
doesn't have this surgery

03:12.792 --> 03:15.625
he'll die, very painfully.

03:15.708 --> 03:16.792
And none of us want that.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.125
That is immaterial.

03:18.208 --> 03:21.083
You must not cut into the child.

03:21.167 --> 03:25.417
Now I know what is written.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.542
[instrumental music]

03:31.625 --> 03:35.250
(male narrator)
It was the dawn
of the third age of mankind

03:35.333 --> 03:38.458
ten years after
the Earth-Minbari War.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.792
The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.

03:41.875 --> 03:45.333
It's goal, to prevent another
war by creating a place

03:45.417 --> 03:46.750
where humans and aliens

03:46.833 --> 03:49.333
could work out their
differences peacefully.

03:49.417 --> 03:52.125
It's a port of call,
home away from home

03:52.208 --> 03:57.292
for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.

03:57.375 --> 04:01.708
Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons

04:01.792 --> 04:05.667
of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.

04:07.167 --> 04:09.417
It can be a dangerous place.

04:09.500 --> 04:12.625
But it's our last,
best hope for peace.

04:12.708 --> 04:16.583
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

04:16.667 --> 04:18.792
The year is 2258.

04:18.875 --> 04:22.500
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

04:22.583 --> 04:25.625
[theme music]

04:55.583 --> 04:58.625
[music continues]

05:02.125 --> 05:05.125
Confirmed, Azimov.
We'll be right there.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.125
Commander, we just received
a distress signal

05:07.208 --> 05:09.042
from the starliner Azimov.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.042
'They've had a fire in their
command and control center.'

05:11.125 --> 05:13.333
- How serious?
- Seems to be taken care of.

05:13.417 --> 05:15.333
However, they've lost their
navigational computer

05:15.417 --> 05:17.042
and most
of their communication channels.

05:17.125 --> 05:20.250
'They were en route here, but
now they're just flying blind.'

05:20.333 --> 05:23.542
- Location?
- Grid 471 by 18.

05:23.625 --> 05:26.583
- That's Raider territory.
- Exactly.

05:26.667 --> 05:28.042
Recommend we dispatch
a fighter wing

05:28.125 --> 05:31.083
to meet the Azimov
and escort it back here.

05:31.167 --> 05:33.167
A potential combat situation
requires the presence

05:33.250 --> 05:35.125
of at least one command officer.

05:35.208 --> 05:36.750
Is Garibaldi available?

05:38.542 --> 05:41.042
I suppose.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.000
What?

05:42.083 --> 05:43.542
[sighs]
'Nothing.'

05:43.625 --> 05:46.333
I certainly have plenty
of things to occupy myself here.

05:46.417 --> 05:50.250
Yes, sir. I think I'll just walk
to and fro for a while.

05:50.333 --> 05:51.667
Maybe over to my console.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.458
After that,
maybe I'll try pacing fro and to

05:54.542 --> 05:56.125
you know,
just for the kick of it.

05:56.208 --> 05:58.333
[sighs]
Oh, and there's the view,
of course.

05:58.417 --> 06:02.667
Granted, it's not quite the
same as if you were outside.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.125
For someone
who's got over 100 hours

06:04.208 --> 06:06.042
of combat flying experience.

06:11.042 --> 06:13.333
- If you'd rather..
- No, no, no, that's okay.

06:13.417 --> 06:14.667
Don't mind.
Don't worry about me.

06:14.750 --> 06:18.208
I'm just gonna sit here
and knit something.

06:18.292 --> 06:21.042
Maybe a nice sweater,
some socks.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.125
[sighs]

06:23.208 --> 06:25.833
Does the term "stir crazy"
ring a bell, commander?

06:25.917 --> 06:27.292
I have an idea,
lieutenant commander

06:27.375 --> 06:29.000
why don't you take out
the fighter wing

06:29.083 --> 06:32.583
and escort the Azimov
back to base?

06:32.667 --> 06:33.875
Well, if you insist, sir.

06:35.542 --> 06:38.542
So you see,
removing the blockage is easy.

06:38.625 --> 06:40.125
And the body's
fluid-transfer system

06:40.208 --> 06:43.042
will regain it's integrity
almost immediately.

06:43.125 --> 06:44.750
'After that,
it's very a simple matter'

06:44.833 --> 06:47.625
'to reinflate
the internal air sac.'

06:47.708 --> 06:49.458
He'll need to rest
for a day or two

06:49.542 --> 06:51.458
but he's young and strong.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.542
His recovery should be easy.

06:53.625 --> 06:56.000
It's a very simple procedure.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.208
We understand the procedure
all too well.

06:58.292 --> 06:59.875
That is why we won't allow it.

06:59.958 --> 07:03.875
The veterinarians on our
own world perform this surgery

07:03.958 --> 07:05.917
on distressed food animals.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.417
So you're just gonna
let him die?

07:07.500 --> 07:09.375
What kind of a god
do you worship?

07:09.458 --> 07:12.167
We cannot discuss this
any longer. This is useless.

07:12.250 --> 07:13.667
Well, uh.. Wait, wait, wait.

07:13.750 --> 07:17.667
Uh, I-I think
there might be another way.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.500
It will, it will take longer

07:19.583 --> 07:21.750
and it will be
far more uncomfortable

07:21.833 --> 07:23.333
and it, and it will cost more.

07:23.417 --> 07:25.500
The cost is not the issue,
Dr. Franklin

07:25.583 --> 07:26.833
nor is the discomfort.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.458
We are the Children of Time.

07:28.542 --> 07:30.708
We cannot break our covenant
anymore than you could cease

07:30.792 --> 07:33.333
to be the descendant
of egg-sucking mammaloids.

07:33.417 --> 07:36.750
My husband intends
no offense, doctor.

07:36.833 --> 07:38.167
Of course.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.292
I think we can
try something here

07:41.375 --> 07:44.375
that, that might give Shon's
natural defenses

07:44.458 --> 07:46.708
a chance
to break up the blockage.

07:46.792 --> 07:52.375
If, if we use a combination of
emollients and, and microbeams

07:52.458 --> 07:56.333
to provide a physical access
for his own internal fluids

07:56.417 --> 07:59.167
we, we might help the body
clear itself.

07:59.250 --> 08:03.042
I'm not promising you that this
procedure will work as well.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.208
It, it may not work at all,
but, uh

08:05.292 --> 08:06.667
I don't think you're gonna find
another doctor

08:06.750 --> 08:08.042
who will suggest anything better

08:08.125 --> 08:11.042
and you will lose valuable time
if you go looking.

08:13.583 --> 08:16.167
May we discuss this alone,
please?

08:18.208 --> 08:19.333
Of course.

08:30.958 --> 08:32.250
[whirring]

08:34.458 --> 08:35.667
What the hell are you doing?

08:35.750 --> 08:37.125
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.375
You never insult
a patient's beliefs.

08:39.458 --> 08:41.792
You work with them. You try
to understand their concerns.

08:41.875 --> 08:43.667
You give them a reason
to be on your side.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.833
And you think lying to them
is going to help?

08:45.917 --> 08:47.083
I didn't lie to them.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.292
You know as well as I

08:48.375 --> 08:49.750
that mineral oil and microbeams

08:49.833 --> 08:52.000
won't dislodge that mass.
It's rooted!

08:52.083 --> 08:54.417
That kid is going under
the knife or into the freezer!

08:54.500 --> 08:55.917
Those are the only options.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.708
Sometimes you
have to heal the family

08:57.792 --> 08:59.500
before you can heal the patient.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.917
This isn't some
silly superstition to them.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.708
This is real,
they're not gonna let it go

09:03.792 --> 09:04.958
just because you tell them to.

09:05.042 --> 09:06.958
It's going to kill their kid!

09:07.042 --> 09:09.458
If we insist on cutting,
they will put that kid

09:09.542 --> 09:10.833
on the first star cruiser
out of here.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.042
And he won't survive
the first jump.

09:13.125 --> 09:16.417
I am trying to find a way
to save him, doctor.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.083
Look, these people,
they're terrified!

09:20.167 --> 09:21.792
But they're just not ready
to cut to the chase.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.500
So first, first we do
a little of this

09:23.583 --> 09:24.625
and, and we do a little of that.

09:24.708 --> 09:26.000
Torturing the patient

09:26.083 --> 09:28.958
with remedies that don't work.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.750
Until they're desperate enough
to bite the damn bullet

09:30.833 --> 09:33.833
and let us do what we should
have done in the first place.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.750
Now, I don't like it any more
than you do, doctor

09:35.833 --> 09:37.292
but we don't get a vote, only..

09:37.375 --> 09:38.625
[buzzing]

09:43.750 --> 09:47.208
Our son will not survive
another space trip, will he?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.625
No, I don't think so.

09:50.708 --> 09:56.667
Then we either accept
the fragile hope you offer

09:56.750 --> 09:58.875
or we watch our son die in pain.

10:03.958 --> 10:06.458
It is not much of a choice,
is it?

10:10.292 --> 10:12.208
Stand by,
Alpha Wing ready to launch.

10:12.292 --> 10:13.583
- 'Roger.'
- 'Launch.'

10:13.667 --> 10:15.125
[rumbling]

'We're going into a sector
noted for attacks by Raiders.'

10:19.750 --> 10:22.458
'Suggest minimal chatter
till we contact the Azimov.'

10:22.542 --> 10:24.083
Don't wanna attract
any attention.

10:24.167 --> 10:26.208
You just wanna get in
and get out.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.750
(male #2)
'Confirmed, Alpha Leader.'

10:31.958 --> 10:32.958
Prepare for jump.

10:33.042 --> 10:36.125
[dramatic music]

10:38.917 --> 10:40.625
You're gonna
have to stay in bed for a while.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.583
It's gonna be boring
but the station has

10:42.667 --> 10:44.125
over a 1000 educational

10:44.208 --> 10:45.667
and entertainment channels
and you can watch--

10:45.750 --> 10:49.500
No. We have seen
some of that material.

10:49.583 --> 10:53.375
Those channels demonstrate
false belief systems.

10:53.458 --> 10:56.958
We do not want our child exposed
to inappropriate information.

10:57.042 --> 10:59.833
He can study the scrolls
if he gets bored.

10:59.917 --> 11:03.750
'The scrolls can be very calming
when the mind is in turmoil.'

11:03.833 --> 11:07.208
In particular, the Parable
of the 7th Declination

11:07.292 --> 11:08.917
in the Scroll of Herrel

11:09.000 --> 11:11.167
'where the young Herrel
makes his final vow'

11:11.250 --> 11:13.625
'of commitment
to the honor of his family.'

11:13.708 --> 11:18.083
I've always found that
to be a most inspiring lesson.

11:18.167 --> 11:20.333
I've got something for you.
Look at that.

11:20.417 --> 11:21.958
Ooh. What is it?

11:22.042 --> 11:24.667
Well, this..

11:24.750 --> 11:26.208
...is a gloppit egg.

11:26.292 --> 11:31.750
Now, the gloppit is a very rare
creature from the planet..

11:31.833 --> 11:34.417
Planet Placebo.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.875
The egg has to be held
just like this.

11:40.000 --> 11:44.792
And petted just like this.

11:45.708 --> 11:47.750
And talked to softly.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.708
Just like this.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.000
Since I'm going to be
too busy treating you

11:55.083 --> 11:56.333
to take care of it for a while..

11:56.417 --> 11:58.500
...you're gonna have
to do that for me.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.500
Okay?

12:00.583 --> 12:04.458
It is alright, isn't it? Please?

12:04.542 --> 12:07.917
'Monnya? Dottya?'

12:08.000 --> 12:10.417
The gloppit. It's..

12:10.500 --> 12:12.958
It is not
a dangerous creature, is it?

12:13.042 --> 12:15.208
Don't worry,
it's perfectly safe.

12:15.292 --> 12:16.750
Well, then you may speak
to the egg, Shon.

12:16.833 --> 12:19.917
But you may not speak
of sacred things to it.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.417
Those are only for our people.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.625
Yes, Dottya. Thank you.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.500
[chuckles]
Just like this.

12:26.583 --> 12:29.667
[instrumental music]

12:43.083 --> 12:45.667
- 'Gloppit eggs?'
- Eh, boy's terrified.

12:45.750 --> 12:46.875
He needs a friend.

12:46.958 --> 12:49.500
So you gave him a piece
of industrial goo?

12:49.583 --> 12:53.500
I gave him something
to believe in.

12:53.583 --> 12:54.792
What?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.917
You don't disapprove
of superstition

12:57.000 --> 12:58.583
if it's your superstition.

12:58.667 --> 13:00.500
And what is that
supposed to mean?

13:00.583 --> 13:02.000
They worship the Great Egg.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.917
Your god is medicine and you can
do no wrong in his service.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.167
'What's the difference?'

13:07.250 --> 13:10.125
I produce measurable
testable results.

13:10.208 --> 13:13.208
- What's your point?
- Did you see their eyes?

13:13.292 --> 13:15.292
They're terrified.

13:15.375 --> 13:17.458
You didn't solve anything,
you just postponed it.

13:17.542 --> 13:20.708
I gave them the chance to think
about it, to reconsider.

13:20.792 --> 13:22.833
You are so certain, aren't you?

13:22.917 --> 13:24.542
Alright, look. Look, look, look.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.875
If you think you can find
a better way, go ahead.

13:26.958 --> 13:29.042
Research, prove me wrong
if it'll make you happy.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.667
You're not gonna find anything.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.583
And I'll bet a steak dinner
on that too.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.667
Can't get steak out here.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.500
Then I'll import one.

13:36.583 --> 13:40.208
One way or another,
I'm gonna save that boy's life

13:40.292 --> 13:41.792
whatever it costs.

13:47.542 --> 13:48.875
[sighs]

13:52.000 --> 13:54.458
[instrumental music]

13:57.750 --> 14:00.333
Why do you want
to import a steak?

14:00.417 --> 14:01.750
Research.

14:01.833 --> 14:03.042
Who's paying for it?

14:03.125 --> 14:06.417
Maya Hernandez. Or me.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.583
'I'll let you know
in a couple of days.'

14:08.667 --> 14:10.958
Did you see this one,
the Shakespeare Corporation

14:11.042 --> 14:14.125
wants to trans-ship
a load of fingle eggs.

14:15.583 --> 14:18.833
[scoffs]
They gotta be kidding. No way.

14:18.917 --> 14:20.708
In my opinion, the presence
of fingle eggs

14:20.792 --> 14:23.042
aboard this installation
might present a serious hazard.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.583
- Thanks. I owe you.
- Import another steak.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.250
I don't owe you that much.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.083
What's happening
with the respiratory case?

14:32.167 --> 14:35.500
- 'Anything new?'
- Boy's gonna die.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.875
Parents won't let me operate.
What do I do?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.292
[sighs]

14:41.375 --> 14:43.125
You know,
the authority of Babylon 5

14:43.208 --> 14:44.833
doesn't cover every contingency.

14:44.917 --> 14:47.833
In circumstances like this,
we're in a legal limbo.

14:47.917 --> 14:50.042
You could order me to take
whatever steps I felt necessary

14:50.125 --> 14:52.708
to save that boy's life,
including surgery.

14:52.792 --> 14:55.625
If I do that,
it establishes a precedent.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.750
You've already done that
when you told my predecessor

14:57.833 --> 15:01.250
to save the life
of Ambassador Kosh.

15:01.333 --> 15:04.625
- Yes, I was briefed.
- 'He's right.'

15:04.708 --> 15:06.875
You already established that
the safety of an individual life

15:06.958 --> 15:09.667
outweighs the legal concerns
of his or her race.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.625
On the other hand,
if you get involved in this

15:11.708 --> 15:14.125
you give up
all pretense at neutrality.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.958
It'll damage the authority
of the station.

15:16.042 --> 15:17.750
What if I made
an official request?

15:17.833 --> 15:20.250
I'm asking you to find
another way to resolve this.

15:20.333 --> 15:21.625
You don't care if that boy dies?

15:21.708 --> 15:23.208
That's not the issue.

15:23.292 --> 15:25.292
If it were, we wouldn't
be having this conversation

15:25.375 --> 15:26.958
But it's not the only issue.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.500
But this isn't going to go away.

15:36.583 --> 15:37.875
Neither will I.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.917
[beeping]

15:44.000 --> 15:45.625
[buzzing]

15:48.417 --> 15:49.875
[dramatic music]

15:51.583 --> 15:53.792
(Susan on comms)
'This was the Azimov's
last known position.'

15:53.875 --> 15:57.167
Scanners at maximum. Maintain
radio silence until contact.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.708
[rumbling]

16:16.667 --> 16:19.375
- You're doing fine.
- No.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.208
I'm afraid.

16:24.292 --> 16:28.375
Maybe this gloppit egg
will have to hatch without me.

16:28.458 --> 16:31.458
No, no, no.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.667
'See? It's still glowing.'

16:35.417 --> 16:38.125
'That means
you're doing a good job.'

16:38.208 --> 16:42.833
You just keep holding it,
just like that. Okay?

16:56.708 --> 16:59.917
Your treatment isn't working.
He's getting weaker.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.083
If we had taken him away

17:01.167 --> 17:02.583
we might have gotten him
to Thailateen.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.083
He never would have
survived the trip.

17:04.167 --> 17:06.000
He was already too weak.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.708
Because we trusted you,
our son will die.

17:08.792 --> 17:13.375
No. He will die
because you won't trust me.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.417
'Now, you brought him here
because you wanted me'

17:15.500 --> 17:19.500
to save him.
Well, let me save him, please.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.958
He needs that surgery

17:22.042 --> 17:25.250
or he will choke to death
on his own fluids.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.458
There are more important things
in life than the next breath.

17:28.542 --> 17:31.000
Without his spirit,
he wouldn't be alive anyway.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.250
He is your son, damn it.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.708
Do yourself a favor.
No, do him a favor.

17:36.792 --> 17:38.875
Stop deluding yourselves.

17:39.917 --> 17:42.375
Alright, no more superstition.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.417
We have the safety
of the patient precedent

17:44.500 --> 17:46.333
here on the station,
you leave me no choice.

17:46.417 --> 17:48.000
but to ask Commander Sinclair

17:48.083 --> 17:49.458
to suspend
your parental authority.

17:49.542 --> 17:50.458
What does that mean?

17:50.542 --> 17:51.708
'That means I'll do whatever'

17:51.792 --> 17:53.625
I feel necessary
to save your son's life.

17:53.708 --> 17:54.917
I'll put aside your objections

17:55.000 --> 17:56.292
and I will perform that surgery

17:56.375 --> 17:57.625
without your permission.

17:57.708 --> 18:01.500
No! You can't do that.
You mustn't do that.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.958
Please, Dr. Franklin.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.542
I'm sorry.

18:05.625 --> 18:08.042
I have to do
what I feel is best for Shon.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.667
Then so do we.

18:24.458 --> 18:25.917
[dramatic music]

18:26.000 --> 18:28.750
(Susan)
'There she is.'

18:28.833 --> 18:31.833
'This is Babylon Escort Wing
Alpha to starliner Azimov.'

18:31.917 --> 18:33.375
Please fall into formation
behind us.

18:33.458 --> 18:35.542
We'll escort you to the station.

18:35.625 --> 18:37.667
(man on comms)
'Confirmed, Alpha Wing.
Thanks for the save.'

18:37.750 --> 18:40.125
No problem.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.833
I wish you had
an ambassador here.

18:41.917 --> 18:45.042
It would simplify
my problem immensely.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.000
I would ask her for guidance.

18:47.083 --> 18:49.500
She would tell you
the same thing.

18:49.583 --> 18:52.000
Please don't let
Dr. Franklin operate.

18:54.292 --> 18:55.583
Since you have no representative

18:55.667 --> 18:57.833
that means
that I have to be your advocate.

18:57.917 --> 19:00.458
And that means that I have to
consider the safety of the child

19:00.542 --> 19:02.208
as well as
the rights of the parents.

19:02.292 --> 19:04.042
He is not your responsibility.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.708
Unfortunately, he is now.

19:05.792 --> 19:08.708
Dr. Franklin has made
an official request.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.250
And I have to rule on it.

19:11.333 --> 19:13.583
Thank you for explaining
your side of it.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.583
I'll make my decision
within 24 hours.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.500
You will rule against us,
won't you?

19:23.583 --> 19:26.208
You will give our child
to Dr. Franklin.

19:26.292 --> 19:28.417
Earth people
always stick together.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.250
I'm sorry you feel that way.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.500
No. Feel sorry for your doctor.

19:32.583 --> 19:37.125
If he harms my child, if he
touches Shon, I will kill him.

19:37.208 --> 19:40.250
[dramatic music]

19:47.833 --> 19:50.958
(female #1)
'And that is why we are asking
for Narn protection.'

19:51.042 --> 19:55.167
We have no ambassador of our own
to represent our interests.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.250
If we don't get someone
with strength

19:57.333 --> 19:59.250
to intercede on our behalf

19:59.333 --> 20:01.167
Commander Sinclair
will take our son away

20:01.250 --> 20:03.833
and let the doctor
violate his spirit.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.708
I'd never even heard
of your world until two days ago

20:06.792 --> 20:10.167
when my research staff
acknowledged your arrival.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.667
'Interesting little place'

20:11.750 --> 20:15.583
but it really has nothing
to offer the Narn Regime.

20:15.667 --> 20:19.750
You see, alliances are built
on mutual advantage.

20:19.833 --> 20:23.125
We're not asking you
to negotiate a treaty.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.792
We're asking you
to help save our child.

20:25.875 --> 20:30.958
But you're asking me to exercise
my authority on your behalf.

20:31.042 --> 20:33.625
[scoffs]
What were you thinking
when you petitioned us?

20:33.708 --> 20:37.292
We thought your dislike
of the Earthers would be enough.

20:37.375 --> 20:40.708
Enough for us, not for you.

20:40.792 --> 20:42.667
We do not casually
entangle ourselves

20:42.750 --> 20:44.708
in the affairs of other species.

20:44.792 --> 20:49.083
Please, he's our son.
Have you no sympathy?

20:49.167 --> 20:53.417
I sympathize entirely, my dear.

20:53.500 --> 20:57.625
[sighs]
This is a difficult
and distressing situation.

20:57.708 --> 20:59.083
Could you help us?

20:59.167 --> 21:01.208
Well, I would have to
go to the Council

21:01.292 --> 21:03.500
and request injunctive relief.

21:03.583 --> 21:06.083
The Council could have
Commander Sinclair's decision

21:06.167 --> 21:07.500
set aside once he makes it

21:07.583 --> 21:12.833
but I would have to get approval
from my world.

21:12.917 --> 21:17.333
And I am certain they would want
me to justify the cost, yes?

21:17.417 --> 21:19.292
The cost?

21:19.375 --> 21:22.167
The research,
the committee hearings.

21:22.250 --> 21:25.500
'All the necessary paperwork
involved.'

21:25.583 --> 21:28.750
Unfortunately,
we are on a budget here.

21:28.833 --> 21:32.458
We cannot justify such expenses
for non-Centauri.

21:34.708 --> 21:36.208
Excuse me?

21:36.292 --> 21:38.458
Just how much justice
can you afford?

21:38.542 --> 21:40.875
(Londo Mollari)
The Vorlons are very powerful.

21:40.958 --> 21:42.542
If you filed a protest

21:42.625 --> 21:44.542
Commander Sinclair
would have to forbid

21:44.625 --> 21:47.375
Dr. Franklin to operate
on our son.

21:47.458 --> 21:51.167
Will you consider one thing?
Please.

21:51.250 --> 21:53.167
If it were your child

21:53.250 --> 21:56.667
or even you yourself,
how would you feel

21:56.750 --> 21:58.458
'if the doctor of Babylon 5'

21:58.542 --> 22:01.708
wanted to perform
an unwelcome procedure on you?

22:01.792 --> 22:05.708
(Kosh)
The avalanche
has already started.

22:05.792 --> 22:10.333
It is too late
for the pebbles to vote.

22:10.417 --> 22:12.708
(Delenn)
I understand your frustration.

22:12.792 --> 22:16.708
It must be difficult for you
to feel so powerless.

22:16.792 --> 22:21.500
You cannot imagine.
We cannot sleep, we cannot eat.

22:21.583 --> 22:23.542
We can no longer focus
our thoughts

22:23.625 --> 22:25.083
for our daily meditations.

22:25.167 --> 22:28.208
We are consumed by this.

22:28.292 --> 22:32.542
And no one listens.
No one hears.

22:32.625 --> 22:35.250
I cannot tell you
how much all this troubles me.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.125
Then you will help us?

22:37.208 --> 22:39.500
We, Minbari

22:39.583 --> 22:40.750
have our own relationship

22:40.833 --> 22:43.167
with the larger domains
of the universe.

22:43.250 --> 22:46.917
'Matters of the soul
are very private'

22:47.000 --> 22:49.042
very personal to us.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.667
We have suffered
the interference

22:50.750 --> 22:52.583
of others in this area

22:52.667 --> 22:55.292
and are thus ourselves forbidden

22:55.375 --> 22:57.500
to intervene in these matters
such as this.

22:57.583 --> 23:00.875
You are refusing
because of your beliefs?

23:00.958 --> 23:02.167
We thought the Minbari

23:02.250 --> 23:04.542
were the most intelligent
of all races.

23:04.625 --> 23:07.292
We are only trying
to save our child.

23:07.375 --> 23:11.250
That is also what Dr. Franklin
believes he is doing.

23:11.333 --> 23:15.583
Whose belief is correct?
And how do we prove it?

23:17.208 --> 23:23.208
No. On this issue,
the Minbari cannot take sides.

a Raider ship.'

23:33.708 --> 23:36.042
- Has it seen us?
- 'Don't think so.'

23:36.125 --> 23:37.833
Alright.
Continue to run silent.

we don't want a conflict
if we can avoid it.

23:41.917 --> 23:43.500
'Speed to maximum.'

23:46.292 --> 23:48.500
[indistinct announcement on PA]

23:48.583 --> 23:51.333
You'll need a hell of a lot
more firepower to take that out.

23:51.417 --> 23:53.958
Though I'm fairly certain
the blue stuff is dead.

23:59.083 --> 24:01.417
- How you doing, Jeff?
- Lousy.

24:01.500 --> 24:03.417
Still thinking about that kid?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.125
Dr. Franklin wants me
to intervene.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.167
His folks want the ambassadors
to do something.

24:07.250 --> 24:09.750
And none of them want to get
involved. And why should they?

24:09.833 --> 24:11.250
'Why help yourself
to a barrel full of blame'

24:11.333 --> 24:12.583
if you can avoid it?

24:12.667 --> 24:14.875
Even Earth Central
has passed the buck back to me.

24:14.958 --> 24:17.500
- You spoke to Senator Gant?
- Only for an advisory.

24:17.583 --> 24:20.708
I'm not calling Central every
time I have a decision to make.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.542
- And?
- He declined even to advise.

24:23.625 --> 24:25.208
Said it's my responsibility.

24:25.292 --> 24:28.042
It may be your responsibility,
but it isn't your fault.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.708
This is a tough situation
for everyone.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.500
That doesn't make me feel
any better.

24:31.583 --> 24:34.583
Nothing will.
It's a child's life.

24:34.667 --> 24:37.833
But letting it eat at you won't
help you, him or his parents.

24:37.917 --> 24:39.750
I just wish
I could be more sure.

24:39.833 --> 24:42.542
Sure is for people with nothing
on the line.

24:42.625 --> 24:45.167
You and me,
we just get on with it.

24:45.250 --> 24:48.208
Now I know how Pontius Pilate
must have felt.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.792
[dramatic music]

25:09.500 --> 25:12.708
Hello, Shon.
I'm Commander Sinclair.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.625
Welcome to Babylon 5.

25:14.708 --> 25:16.542
'What do you think
of my station?'

25:16.625 --> 25:20.250
I haven't seen much of it.

25:20.333 --> 25:22.208
Only the Medlab.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.583
What's this?

25:28.667 --> 25:34.458
I-it's a gloppit egg.
Dr. Franklin gave it to me.

25:34.542 --> 25:36.167
A gloppit egg?

25:36.250 --> 25:39.250
Ac-actually,
it's only a piece of..

25:42.958 --> 25:45.458
...industrial goo.

25:45.542 --> 25:49.625
But, please, don't tell
Dr. Franklin I said so.

25:51.042 --> 25:53.208
He still believes it's an egg.

25:53.292 --> 25:54.708
Haa.

26:01.167 --> 26:05.458
Shon, I have to ask you
a very difficult question.

26:05.542 --> 26:07.458
I know you've been thinking
about it.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.125
Do I want to live?

26:10.500 --> 26:13.042
Yes. Very much.

26:14.375 --> 26:17.792
But I don't want the operation.

26:17.875 --> 26:20.250
I don't wanna lose my spirit.

26:20.333 --> 26:23.292
There's nothing to be afraid of.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.667
I had an operation once.

26:24.750 --> 26:29.042
A very serious operation,
but I'm fine now.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.500
But you are not
one of the chosen.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.167
You are not born of the Egg.

26:35.250 --> 26:36.708
No, I'm not.

26:41.917 --> 26:43.333
Tell me about it.

26:48.417 --> 26:49.667
Smart kid.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.250
Are you going to sign the order?

26:53.083 --> 26:56.042
You believe you're doing
the right thing, don't you?

26:57.583 --> 27:00.500
'So do the parents.
Who should I believe?'

27:00.583 --> 27:04.708
You, because we share
the same beliefs? Or do we?

27:04.792 --> 27:08.833
Commander, those parents are
willing to see their son die

27:08.917 --> 27:10.208
because of their religion.

27:10.292 --> 27:13.667
Now, you can't expect me to sit
here and do nothing.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.542
May God save us
from false religion.

27:15.625 --> 27:17.875
What makes a religion false?

27:17.958 --> 27:21.042
If any religion is right, then
maybe they all have to be right.

27:21.125 --> 27:22.542
Maybe God doesn't care
how you say your prayers

27:22.625 --> 27:24.083
just as long as you say them.

27:24.167 --> 27:26.708
- What if there's no God at all?
- Is that what you believe?

27:26.792 --> 27:28.875
I believe in saving lives.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.708
Without life,
the question is meaningless.

27:30.792 --> 27:35.083
But life has to be more
than just a pulse beat.

27:35.167 --> 27:38.458
What we hold sacred
gives our lives meaning.

27:38.542 --> 27:40.125
What are we taking away
from this child?

27:40.208 --> 27:43.500
That's a question we can worry
about after the operation.

27:43.583 --> 27:44.750
Are you absolutely certain

27:44.833 --> 27:47.167
this is the only way
to save the boy?

27:47.250 --> 27:48.583
Yes.

27:51.917 --> 27:54.000
That only makes
the decision harder.

27:56.417 --> 27:58.875
I have to refuse
to sign the order.

27:58.958 --> 28:02.042
'I can't allow you
to perform the operation.'

28:02.125 --> 28:03.458
What?

28:08.500 --> 28:11.375
[dramatic music]

28:11.458 --> 28:13.375
(Franklin)
'I don't believe this.'

28:13.458 --> 28:14.792
I thought I could depend on you.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.667
How can you deny me
permission to operate?

28:16.750 --> 28:18.542
If it were just me,
I would have signed the order

28:18.625 --> 28:19.708
in the first place.

28:19.792 --> 28:21.208
But if a commander of Babylon 5

28:21.292 --> 28:23.042
starts overruling
individual beliefs

28:23.125 --> 28:24.750
just because
they violate his own beliefs

28:24.833 --> 28:26.667
will be setting
a dangerous precedent.

28:26.750 --> 28:28.542
It establishes that the concerns
of other races

28:28.625 --> 28:30.917
will be set aside whenever
it's convenient for Earth.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.250
That's not what you said

28:32.333 --> 28:33.833
when Ambassador Kosh
was on the table.

28:33.917 --> 28:36.125
Operating on Kosh was
the camel's nose in the tent.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.458
Operating on Shon will be the
rest of the camel.

28:38.542 --> 28:39.708
I have to stop it somewhere.

28:39.792 --> 28:41.458
I have to honor the beliefs
of the parents.

28:41.542 --> 28:44.458
Otherwise Babylon 5's charter
will be compromised.

28:44.542 --> 28:46.000
And the station's ability
to function

28:46.083 --> 28:47.542
as an independent meeting place

28:47.625 --> 28:49.875
for all the different races
in the galaxy will be destroyed.

28:49.958 --> 28:51.458
You're just gonna let him die.

28:51.542 --> 28:54.667
For God's sake, doctor,
do you think I want to do this?

28:54.750 --> 28:57.042
I have no more choice here
than anybody else.

28:57.125 --> 28:58.750
I have to be the advocate
for the parents

28:58.833 --> 29:00.042
because no one else will.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.458
[device beeps]

29:01.542 --> 29:02.833
Franklin.

29:02.917 --> 29:05.125
(Maya)
'Shon's life signs
are dropping.'

29:05.208 --> 29:06.708
Call the parents.

29:08.917 --> 29:13.250
When the egg hatched,
you first crept out

29:13.333 --> 29:17.083
you were such
a tiny morsel of life.

29:17.167 --> 29:20.792
I could hold you
in my cradled hands.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.083
I was so proud of you then.

29:23.167 --> 29:26.833
As proud as I was of the day
that you were born.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.667
Today, I'm even prouder.

29:30.667 --> 29:32.417
Because you're meeting
your destiny

29:32.500 --> 29:35.167
'like the true
Child of the Egg.'

29:35.250 --> 29:38.458
(M'Ola)
We love you so much.

29:38.542 --> 29:41.542
I promise you..

29:41.625 --> 29:46.667
...we will sing
many songs for you

29:46.750 --> 29:52.417
'so that your journey will be
fast and peaceful.'

29:52.500 --> 29:56.917
And when you get
to the other side, my son

29:57.000 --> 29:59.042
you must sing for us.

30:00.958 --> 30:05.917
You must be...our beacon home.

30:27.417 --> 30:29.083
He needs his rest.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.250
Shon, I..

30:36.333 --> 30:37.875
I, um..

30:37.958 --> 30:39.542
'I-I wish..'

30:42.583 --> 30:44.042
[sobs]

30:44.125 --> 30:45.958
Dottya.

30:57.417 --> 31:00.583
I'm glad
you didn't get your way.

31:00.667 --> 31:03.833
I'm grateful for
the commander's wisdom.

31:03.917 --> 31:05.333
This is better.

31:05.417 --> 31:07.833
Sorry I can't agree with you.

31:07.917 --> 31:10.292
The child deserves
a chance at life.

31:10.375 --> 31:12.583
Yes.

31:12.667 --> 31:17.167
But without a spirit,
it isn't life at all.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.375
'You know that.'

31:19.458 --> 31:21.917
I'll call you if there's
any change in his condition.

31:32.708 --> 31:34.917
[door whirring]

31:44.083 --> 31:45.333
I think you should go now.

31:45.417 --> 31:47.833
You're going to do it anyway,
aren't you?

31:47.917 --> 31:50.375
They have their beliefs
and I have mine.

31:51.500 --> 31:53.917
I took an oath. So did you.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.042
If I stand by and do nothing..

31:58.125 --> 32:01.083
Sinclair will have you
thrown off the station.

32:02.500 --> 32:04.708
I'm already packed.

32:04.792 --> 32:08.667
That boy is gonna die in an hour
if I don't operate.

32:08.750 --> 32:12.167
And no one, not you,
not Commander Sinclair

32:12.250 --> 32:15.667
not those poor, deluded parents,
is gonna stop me.

32:15.750 --> 32:18.958
So, you'll need an assist.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.250
(male #2)
'Alpha Leader,
Raider ship detected'

32:23.333 --> 32:26.333
'at coordinates
400 by 20 by 15.'

32:26.417 --> 32:28.292
(Susan)
'Just one ship,
it's probably a scout.'

32:28.375 --> 32:30.417
We've got one hour
before we hit jumpgate.

32:30.500 --> 32:32.667
Jam all channels. We can't
let it contact the rest.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.375
(male #2)
'Jamming.'

32:34.458 --> 32:35.917
'Raider is breaking off,
Alpha Leader.'

32:36.000 --> 32:37.583
'What are your instructions? '

32:37.667 --> 32:39.333
It's probably breaking off
to get outside jamming range

32:39.417 --> 32:40.708
bring in reinforcements.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.375
'Stay with the Azimov
and escort it back to the base.'

32:42.458 --> 32:43.875
'I'll take out the Raider.'

32:43.958 --> 32:45.792
(male #2)
'Negative.
Violation of orders.'

32:45.875 --> 32:47.125
To hell with orders.
If that ship brings back

32:47.208 --> 32:48.708
a dozen Raiders,
we'll be dead.

32:48.792 --> 32:50.542
Get going, I'll catch up.

32:56.833 --> 32:58.042
Pressure?

32:58.125 --> 32:59.875
We're equalized
to his internal bladder.

32:59.958 --> 33:03.083
- He won't have any trouble.
- Alright.

33:03.167 --> 33:05.167
Might be a slight escape of air
or moisture

33:05.250 --> 33:06.708
when we make this incision.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.042
Here we go.

33:10.125 --> 33:13.417
You can't help but wonder,
can you?

33:13.500 --> 33:15.750
You didn't find anything
in your researches, did you?

33:18.875 --> 33:22.292
- Oh, Lord, preserve this child.
- Say again?

33:22.375 --> 33:24.917
Nothing. I..

33:25.000 --> 33:27.500
It was a prayer for his spirit.

33:27.583 --> 33:30.458
My prayers have to be
just as good as theirs, right?

33:30.542 --> 33:33.250
Besides, what could it hurt?

33:33.333 --> 33:35.208
[beeping]

33:35.292 --> 33:36.625
There she is.

33:38.792 --> 33:41.208
Come on, come on. Come on!

33:43.583 --> 33:45.417
Yes!

33:45.500 --> 33:47.708
Good. Good.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.250
[rapid beeping]

33:51.667 --> 33:53.000
Not good.

33:53.083 --> 33:55.625
[whooshing]

34:00.833 --> 34:03.917
So, Shon, how do you feel?
Here. Here.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.000
There you go. That's it.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.333
Better.

34:08.417 --> 34:12.000
I can breathe again. But I don't
feel different inside.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.792
Well, see, I told you.

34:15.042 --> 34:17.708
I want my mother. And my father.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.292
Well, they're on their way.

34:21.667 --> 34:23.667
Shon.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.625
Your spirit doesn't live
inside your skin.

34:26.708 --> 34:28.667
It's not something
that can escape.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.417
You still have your spirit.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.958
'You can see that now,
don't you?'

34:33.042 --> 34:34.583
'Your parents
will see that too.'

34:37.583 --> 34:41.250
- You asked for us, doctor?
- Dottya. Monnya.

34:41.333 --> 34:45.917
In the name of the Egg,
you did it. You did it anyway.

34:46.042 --> 34:48.875
It's me!
I don't feel any different.

34:48.958 --> 34:51.500
L-listen,
I'll sing songs for you.

34:51.583 --> 34:53.833
[speaking in native language]

34:55.208 --> 34:56.583
- Away, you demon! Away!
- Away!

34:56.667 --> 34:57.542
Please!

34:57.625 --> 34:59.667
[speaking in native language]

34:59.750 --> 35:02.125
Please! Monnya! Dottya!

35:02.208 --> 35:05.667
- What unholiness spawned you?
- No!

35:05.750 --> 35:07.333
- What have you done?
- 'Don't leave me.'

35:07.417 --> 35:09.167
- What have you done?
- 'No!'

35:09.250 --> 35:10.875
Don't leave me!

35:15.792 --> 35:17.792
(Franklin)
Shon, it-it-it's alright.

35:19.375 --> 35:23.208
Come here. It's alright.
It's okay.

35:23.292 --> 35:25.000
[sobbing]

35:26.000 --> 35:27.125
It's okay.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.792
In the name of the Egg

35:28.875 --> 35:31.292
and the nest in which
it resides.

35:31.375 --> 35:34.000
[speaking in native language]

35:37.833 --> 35:39.083
It's okay.

35:40.792 --> 35:42.708
It's okay, Shon.

35:42.792 --> 35:45.542
(Sinclair)
I gave you a direct order,
doctor. You disobeyed it!

35:45.625 --> 35:47.083
I should ask
for your resignation.

35:47.167 --> 35:49.167
- Right here, right now.
- You want it, it's yours.

35:49.250 --> 35:52.250
Don't tempt me, doctor.
Who asked you to play God?

35:52.333 --> 35:55.250
Every damn patient who comes
through that door, that's who.

35:55.333 --> 35:58.083
'People come to doctors because
they want us to be Gods.'

35:58.167 --> 36:00.875
They want us to make it better,
or make it not so.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.375
They want to be healed.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.917
And they come to me when
their prayers aren't enough.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.583
Well, if I have to take
the responsibility

36:06.667 --> 36:10.083
then I claim the authority too.
I did good.

36:10.167 --> 36:13.333
And we both know it, and no one
is gonna take that away.

36:13.417 --> 36:14.625
[machine beeps]

36:17.042 --> 36:18.250
Yes?

36:18.333 --> 36:19.542
Sorry to bother you, commander.

36:19.625 --> 36:22.167
- I'm looking for Dr. Franklin.
- What is it?

36:22.250 --> 36:24.292
I think you should come
to Medlab.

36:24.375 --> 36:26.042
I think you both should come.

36:27.625 --> 36:28.917
Out.

36:42.750 --> 36:44.917
My husband has asked me
to tell you

36:45.000 --> 36:48.292
he knows that what you did,
you did out of your compassion.

36:48.375 --> 36:50.167
'You meant no harm.'

36:50.250 --> 36:53.417
'And if it were in his power
to forgive you, he would.'

36:54.958 --> 36:58.542
I am not allowed
to forgive either.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.333
But if I could, I would.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.500
My husband has brought
the lamuda.

37:06.917 --> 37:09.292
'The traveling robe
for great journeys.'

37:11.167 --> 37:13.250
We will take the boy now.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.542
He needs to rest.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.042
He will.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.250
I'm waiting.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.833
For an apology.

37:35.542 --> 37:38.708
You better check the temperature
in hell first.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.833
[door opens]

37:57.167 --> 37:58.708
Goodbye, Dr. Franklin.

38:00.750 --> 38:03.292
[mellow music]

38:16.458 --> 38:18.167
(Franklin)
'Vital signs stabilizing.'

38:18.250 --> 38:22.250
All indications point to
a speedy recovery. End report.

38:22.333 --> 38:26.000
- I owe you a steak dinner.
- Why?

38:26.083 --> 38:29.208
- You won the bet, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

38:29.292 --> 38:31.750
You dared me to prove you wrong.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.917
I finished the research
on their people

38:35.000 --> 38:36.417
as we discussed.

38:39.458 --> 38:42.125
It's all here. The Great Egg

38:42.208 --> 38:44.792
the Great Journey,
the Great Song.

38:44.875 --> 38:48.500
Hm. There's a lamuda.
Traveling robe.

38:50.875 --> 38:52.458
Oh, my God.

38:52.542 --> 38:55.083
[intense music]

38:59.542 --> 39:01.458
Move! Move!

39:04.833 --> 39:06.458
[panting]

39:08.708 --> 39:10.917
'Oh, my God.'

39:11.000 --> 39:12.458
You did it.

39:13.583 --> 39:15.042
You did it.

39:16.125 --> 39:18.625
Do not grieve.

39:18.708 --> 39:20.625
This was not our son.

39:21.667 --> 39:23.583
'This was only a shell.'

39:25.375 --> 39:28.792
There was nothing to do
but end the pain of the shell.

39:44.542 --> 39:47.167
[instrumental music]

39:47.250 --> 39:48.958
(Franklin)
'You can have my resignation.'

39:49.042 --> 39:51.333
(Sinclair)
'I've decided
not to ask for it.'

39:51.417 --> 39:52.708
'This time.'

39:54.375 --> 39:57.125
You should never have asked me
for a ruling.

39:57.208 --> 39:59.417
Then you wouldn't have had
to disobey it.

39:59.500 --> 40:03.125
I'll know better. Next time.

40:03.208 --> 40:06.875
Would the child have died
if you hadn't operated?

40:10.458 --> 40:13.833
Sometimes doing the right thing
doesn't change anything.

40:13.917 --> 40:15.958
It can drive you crazy.

40:16.042 --> 40:17.500
It's all words.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.458
Just words.

40:23.250 --> 40:26.625
Alright. I was arrogant.

40:26.708 --> 40:29.000
'Thought I knew
what I was doing.'

40:29.083 --> 40:31.958
'Maybe we'd all be better off
if there was no God.'

40:32.042 --> 40:33.833
If God had never been invented.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.500
Then we wouldn't have to be
anything.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.917
We wouldn't have to care.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.833
There's no way you could have
known what they would do.

40:45.917 --> 40:48.833
Don't try to tell me it's not
my fault. Save your breath.

40:48.917 --> 40:52.667
I'm trying to tell you
that what makes us human

40:52.750 --> 40:54.083
is that we care.

40:55.500 --> 40:57.250
And because we care..

40:59.000 --> 41:01.042
...we never stop trying.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.333
No.

41:02.417 --> 41:04.042
What makes us human
is that we have

41:04.125 --> 41:07.125
so many different ways to hurt.

41:19.792 --> 41:21.083
Are you okay?

41:22.292 --> 41:23.542
I'm fine.

41:28.500 --> 41:31.042
[dramatic music]

41:54.458 --> 41:56.625
(man on PA)
'Passengers
from spacecraft Azimov'

41:56.708 --> 41:59.583
'now arriving
Customs Department Area 10.'

41:59.667 --> 42:01.833
[indistinct chatter]

42:04.417 --> 42:05.875
There you are.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.417
What happened out there?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.083
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

42:10.167 --> 42:11.917
I just got back the repair order
on your fighter.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.625
It'll be in the shop
for a week, minimum.

42:13.708 --> 42:15.250
And on top of that,
I hear you broke regs

42:15.333 --> 42:16.542
about leaving formation

42:16.625 --> 42:18.250
'and engaging
in combat without backup.'

42:18.333 --> 42:19.708
It was an educated risk.

42:21.917 --> 42:24.083
- There he is!
- Oh!

42:27.750 --> 42:29.708
Sometimes it works out.

42:29.792 --> 42:31.958
And sometimes it doesn't.

42:32.042 --> 42:34.708
It's a long story.
Come on, I'll fill you in.

42:38.542 --> 42:41.083
[instrumental music]

43:16.750 --> 43:19.000
