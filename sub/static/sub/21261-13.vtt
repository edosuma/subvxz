WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:04.038
Previously on Salvation...
Where are we with the 160?

00:04.072 --> 00:05.339
Jillian's curating all the data.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.108
TANZ:
My personal selections.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.409
I want them put through
all the genetic testing

00:08.442 --> 00:10.811
and analysis.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.680
Tess. She's being attacked.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.748
This is RE/SYST.
They've been in our system since

00:14.782 --> 00:16.084
we launched the gravity tractor.

00:16.117 --> 00:16.817
Once shut down,

00:16.850 --> 00:18.652
this is the only move we have.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.089
Are you with him? Darius?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.057
You never mentioned
you were in love.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.492
GRACE:
No. Harris and I, we're over.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.793
That's not
who I'm talking about.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.395
Darius, what happened
in Moscow...

00:27.428 --> 00:29.430
Needs to stay in Moscow. I know.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.365
We're facing
an extinction-level event.

00:31.399 --> 00:32.833
Think through the consequences
of publishing

00:32.866 --> 00:34.735
this story, Amanda.
There would be global panic.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.270
I'm afraid the cat's
out of the bag

00:36.304 --> 00:38.206
with our reporter friend.

00:38.239 --> 00:39.207
CLAIRE:
Take the necessary action.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.409
(alarm blaring)

00:45.613 --> 00:47.381
TANZ: Initially, we thought
Samson was made of porous rock,

00:47.415 --> 00:48.682
but it has an iron core.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.751
So, the government's plan
to smash

00:50.784 --> 00:51.819
the asteroid
into pieces

00:51.852 --> 00:52.820
with a gravity tractor

00:52.853 --> 00:54.088
won't do a damn thing.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.789
Except destroy
the gravity tractor.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.725
Get the medic.
Turn those cameras off now!

00:57.758 --> 00:59.127
I, Monroe Bennett,
do solemnly swear...

00:59.160 --> 01:00.794
HARRIS:
This is a coup, orchestrated

01:00.828 --> 01:04.198
at the highest levels,
which I am trying to stop.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.534
(weakly):
Welcome, Mr. Secretary.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.836
The only way to regain control
of the gravity tractor

01:08.869 --> 01:11.839
is to regain control
of the country.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.341
By any means necessary.
Are you in?

01:13.374 --> 01:16.210
Well, let's take
these bastards down.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.788
(beeps)

01:27.821 --> 01:29.390
TANZ:
My friends.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.825
If you're listening to this,

01:31.859 --> 01:33.727
I'm afraid
it's because the human race

01:33.761 --> 01:38.832
has gotten itself into,
well, a bit of a pickle.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.180
(phone vibrating)

01:52.213 --> 01:54.215
(gasps)

01:58.252 --> 01:59.320
(alarm sounding)

01:59.353 --> 02:01.222
General Higgins.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.823
What the hell happened?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.892
Digging through the wreckage
will take time, but...

02:04.925 --> 02:07.761
But what?
Bring it up on screen two.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.163
There were three Russian subs

02:09.197 --> 02:10.431
within torpedo range
of the Pike

02:10.464 --> 02:13.201
when it blew up.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.303
GRACE:
At 0600 hours

02:15.336 --> 02:17.238
Eastern Standard Time,
an explosion

02:17.271 --> 02:19.407
of unknown origin
struck the USS Pike

02:19.440 --> 02:22.310
600 kilometers
off the coast of Florida.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.279
The extent of the casualties
is currently unknown.

02:25.313 --> 02:27.281
Yes, Russ.
Grace, any news about survivors?

02:27.315 --> 02:28.616
None as of yet.
Ms. Barrows.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.184
Ms. Barrows...

02:32.320 --> 02:33.321
Ms. Barrows,
when is the president

02:33.354 --> 02:34.822
going to make a statement?

02:34.855 --> 02:38.359
The president is being briefed
as we speak.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.928
Updates will be given
when we have more information.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.763
Thank you.
(reporters clamoring)

02:42.796 --> 02:44.598
Do we know who's
responsible?

02:44.632 --> 02:45.633
Ms. Barrows...

02:45.666 --> 02:48.402
Millie, get me Amanda Neel
at Capitol Eyes.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.205
LIAM: I've never seen
a level of encryption

02:51.239 --> 02:52.840
like this. I mean, the
RE/SYST ghost key spread

02:52.873 --> 02:54.275
through Tess like a cancer.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.677
I have no idea how
to assess the damage.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.512
If only we could ask Tess.

02:58.546 --> 03:02.316
The fastest computer in the
world, and we can't boot her up.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.453
'Cause they'd have full access
to her capabilities.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.488
Well, Darius.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.692
Looks like they used Tess
to launch a brute force attack

03:11.725 --> 03:13.594
on another system
before we shut her down.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.464
I don't recognize it.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.232
I do.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.801
Oh...

03:23.271 --> 03:24.472
(typing)

03:25.806 --> 03:28.208
It's the U.S. military.

03:31.412 --> 03:35.283
RE/SYST used Tess to attack
a U.S. military target.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.318
Right now, we're the only
ones who know about this.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.253
I need you to track
down RE/SYST.

03:39.287 --> 03:42.256
But their last headquarters
was blown up, it was raided.

03:42.290 --> 03:44.258
They have to be
out there somewhere.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.493
Find them.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.601
(line ringing)

03:58.839 --> 04:00.408
(computer chimes)

04:17.525 --> 04:20.928
(intercom beeps)

04:20.961 --> 04:22.930
Millie, did you get Ms. Neel?

04:22.963 --> 04:26.400
MILLIE: Grace, there was a fire
at Capitol Eyes last night.

04:26.434 --> 04:27.401
What?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.871
The place burnt down.

04:30.904 --> 04:34.342
(phone ringing)

04:34.375 --> 04:36.043
Darius.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.579
You need to get me in
to see Bennett and Harris now.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.850
Sir, the Pike's a total loss.
No survivors.

04:42.883 --> 04:44.418
The Pi had control
of the gravity tractor.

04:44.452 --> 04:45.419
Not anymore.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.554
Someone's locked us out.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.088
"Someone"?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.057
I think it's quite clear
who did this, Mr. Secretary.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.425
Mr. President.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.693
I've spoken with
my Russian counterpart

04:52.726 --> 04:53.961
Defense Minister Toporov.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.363
They've denied responsibility...

04:55.396 --> 04:56.964
CLAIRE:
Of course they have.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.466
Because there's no
upside to owning it.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.634
We have clear justification
for retaliation,

05:00.668 --> 05:02.970
valid provocation in the eyes
of the world and our allies.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.605
Any military action

05:04.638 --> 05:07.341
will trigger an even greater
response from Russia.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.609
Have you forgotten
how this all began?

05:08.642 --> 05:11.111
In Chelyabinsk, when
the Russians and the Chinese

05:11.144 --> 05:13.947
colluded to take out
our defense systems.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.783
They will not stop
until we're eliminated.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.318
They are the existential threat.

05:20.053 --> 05:23.424
And our only hope
is to stop them.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.874
TANZ:
First rule of war:

05:40.908 --> 05:43.143
know thine enemy.
And in this case,

05:43.176 --> 05:45.413
that enemy isn't Russia,
it's RE/SYST.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.814
Who the hell let him in here?
Mr. Tanz,

05:46.847 --> 05:48.882
your clearance was revoked.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.752
Well, I have clearance,
and I brought Darius
down here for a reason.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.053
Mr. President,
Mr. Secretary,

05:53.086 --> 05:54.722
you need
to hear this.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.023
If you'll have
your technicians

05:56.056 --> 05:58.459
review these computer logs,

05:58.492 --> 05:59.993
they'll see that RE/SYST
used my supercomputer

06:00.027 --> 06:01.429
to hack into the Pike.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.465
Russia had nothing
to do with it.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.900
Well, according to my generals,
this was the work of a torpedo

06:06.934 --> 06:08.769
launched by a Russian submarine.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.505
All due respect, sir,
your, uh, generals are wrong.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.513
Can this supercomputer of yours
get me my gravity tractor back?

06:19.547 --> 06:24.117
I've had to shut her down
to avoid further catastrophe.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.454
So, in other words, once again,

06:26.487 --> 06:28.589
your recklessness
has compromised all of us.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.990
No, Ms. Rayburn,

06:30.023 --> 06:32.826
your recklessness
has compromised all of us.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.962
Darius had a solution to save us
all. He built an EmDrive.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.864
He got the gravity tractor
up there.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.600
And now you want to use it to
smash the asteroid into pieces

06:39.633 --> 06:41.635
and destroy
the Eastern Hemisphere.

06:41.669 --> 06:45.105
That strategy is not only
immoral, it's nonsense.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.441
The iron core
of the asteroid will destroy

06:47.475 --> 06:49.142
our gravity tractor
and, along with it,

06:49.176 --> 06:50.778
any chance of our survival.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.613
This administration's refusal

06:52.646 --> 06:53.947
to embrace
the scientific facts

06:53.981 --> 06:56.216
is literally the difference
between life and death.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.118
Ms. Barrows,
are you finished?

06:58.151 --> 07:00.521
No. Mr. President.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.491
Let us prove to you that RE/SYST
is behind this attack

07:03.524 --> 07:06.059
before you launch a missile
that you can't take back.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.933
(exhales)

07:17.137 --> 07:19.607
You have 24 hours.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.141
That may not be
enough time, sir.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.477
That's all the time you have,
Ms. Barrows.

07:26.914 --> 07:30.651
I know. You think I've lost it.

07:30.684 --> 07:34.488
Actually, I think
you've found it.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.123
HARRIS:
24 hours.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.558
Not a lot of time.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.059
TANZ: To prove RE/SYST
is the culprit?

07:39.092 --> 07:40.260
No.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.930
To reinstall
President Mackenzie.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.667
(sirens wailing)

07:46.700 --> 07:48.702
(indistinct chatter)

07:52.272 --> 07:54.074
LIAM:
Hey, excuse me?

07:54.107 --> 07:56.577
I'm looking for a friend of
mine; she's a reporter here.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.612
Amanda Neel-- did
she get out okay?

07:58.646 --> 07:59.947
We don't have
any names or IDs yet.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.517
You've got to stay
behind the tape, please, son.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.653
(indistinct radio transmission)

08:07.988 --> 08:09.022
(ringing)

08:09.056 --> 08:10.924
Come on, Amanda, pick up.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.961
Come on, pick up.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.996
(phone ringing)

08:19.299 --> 08:21.501
(phone ringing)

08:37.217 --> 08:39.219
MACKENZIE (weakly):
Mr. Secretary.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.722
Well...

08:41.755 --> 08:44.692
Ms. Barrows.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.126
Mr. Tanz.

08:46.159 --> 08:49.096
My list of allies grows.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.664
GRACE: Madam President,
it's so good

08:50.698 --> 08:51.899
to see you.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.569
How do we install an
illegally deposed president

08:55.603 --> 08:56.937
that everyone thinks is dead?

08:56.970 --> 09:00.040
We show she's alive and able.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.642
Mr. Secretary, this is all
happening too quickly.

09:01.675 --> 09:02.943
She needs more time to recover.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.578
I'm sorry,
but we can't afford

09:04.612 --> 09:05.946
to slow down.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.115
We need to present
the cabinet and the joint chiefs

09:08.148 --> 09:10.117
with an official letter
of competence and fitness.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.351
From you.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.720
MACKENZIE:
Mr. Secretary.

09:12.753 --> 09:15.122
Even with a letter
to the cabinet

09:15.155 --> 09:16.556
and my reappearance...

09:17.390 --> 09:20.027
...Bennett will never
agree to step aside.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.662
Or give up those launch codes.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.664
True, but...

09:23.697 --> 09:25.999
Bennett can't protest
if he's not there.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.968
What are you suggesting?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.337
That we kidnap the president
of the United States.

09:30.370 --> 09:32.205
Now.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.912
*

09:49.757 --> 09:51.825
(elevator bell chimes)

09:58.431 --> 10:00.233
I'm gonna have
to change my cell phone

10:00.267 --> 10:02.736
if I have any hope of
finishing a golf game.

10:02.770 --> 10:04.004
GRACE:
Hey, Dad.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.138
Thanks for coming.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.008
So, kidnapping the president.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.877
Whose crazy idea was that?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.885
(Jillian sighs)

10:17.918 --> 10:20.020
Do you think
Amanda's really dead?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.756
I don't know.

10:22.790 --> 10:27.060
They haven't released the
names of the deceased yet.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.696
Have you told him yet?

10:28.729 --> 10:30.998
I've got bigger problems
right now.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.834
Darius has to be told
he didn't pass the genetic test.

10:33.867 --> 10:37.104
He's expedited the 160,
and I've contacted everyone.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.707
I think he's planning
on using the Ark hangar

10:39.740 --> 10:42.009
as a bunker in case the, um...

10:42.042 --> 10:46.279
What, in case the Russians
bomb the hell out of us?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.281
It's not gonna come to that.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.217
You don't know that.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.420
I'm not gonna let it come
to that and neither is Darius.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.122
He's not a superhero, Liam,
and neither are you.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.456
Jillian.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.792
You know, I understand
that you are too busy

10:58.826 --> 11:00.360
to have emotions right now,

11:00.393 --> 11:03.997
but I am not
and I am scared.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.836
So am I.

11:08.869 --> 11:11.772
But we cannot be
paralyzed by fear.

11:11.805 --> 11:15.275
We have to be
energized by it.

11:15.308 --> 11:19.012
(sighs)

11:19.046 --> 11:21.348
(computer beeps)

11:21.381 --> 11:23.483
LIAM:
This is it.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.819
Yes, this is definitely it.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.054
All right, it's
gonna be okay.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.321
I promise.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.923
Okay.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.892
Section 1
of the 25th Amendment

11:31.925 --> 11:33.326
deals with presidential
succession

11:33.360 --> 11:34.895
in the event of incapacitation
or death.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.830
Mackenzie was declared dead.

11:36.864 --> 11:37.765
Clearly that's
not the case.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.200
An incapacitated president
can reclaim power

11:40.233 --> 11:42.002
once they're again
fit for the job.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.872
So, if Mackenzie can convince
the joint chiefs and the cabinet

11:44.905 --> 11:46.039
that she's of sound mind...

11:46.073 --> 11:48.008
They'll have grounds
to reinstate her,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.910
which brings us back
to our original question:

11:49.943 --> 11:53.246
how do we get Bennett out of
the White House undetected?

11:53.280 --> 11:54.915
There's a series of
emergency tunnels

11:54.948 --> 11:57.785
that run under the White
House, built after 9/11.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.853
If we can create
some pretext

11:59.887 --> 12:01.755
to usher Bennett
into these tunnels,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.156
we can get him out of the White
House without anyone knowing.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.925
We can do this.
HARRIS:
We can.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.427
But can Mackenzie?

12:07.460 --> 12:08.896
(phone chimes)

12:10.163 --> 12:11.965
While you're out handling
the apocalypse of today,

12:11.999 --> 12:14.768
I'll handle the apocalypse
of tomorrow.

12:14.802 --> 12:16.169
I'm gonna get the
gravity tractor

12:16.203 --> 12:17.905
back from RE/SYST.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.306
Good luck.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.108
To all of us.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.848
HUGH: We have about six hours
to pull this off.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.418
The whole place
was torched.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.020
Arson, apparently.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.521
I'm amazed the damn thing
still works.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.523
These things were built
to survive a nuclear holocaust.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.858
I imagine the cockroaches

12:37.891 --> 12:40.961
will be playing a lot
of Candy Crush after doomsday.

12:42.896 --> 12:43.730
So, there's this special,
encrypted connection.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.799
This must be the direct line
to RE/SYST.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.534
Perfect. We're
sending a message.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.002
A text?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.437
No, video.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.072
Ready for my close-up.

12:54.041 --> 12:56.176
Hello, RE/SYST, I know
what you did last summer,

12:56.209 --> 12:57.210
and I'm not happy.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.311
It's time we meet

12:58.345 --> 13:00.047
face-to-face.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.982
I can be your friend
or your worst enemy.

13:02.015 --> 13:03.550
You have ten
seconds to decide.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.085
Nine now.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.490
It's ballsy.
(phone chimes)

13:14.261 --> 13:16.063
Those are coordinates.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.231
Looks like we have a date.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.972
Where have you been?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.840
I wasn't aware
the secretary of defense

13:26.874 --> 13:29.442
had to clear his schedule
with you.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.946
The president is going
to address the nation

13:32.980 --> 13:36.583
from the Oval, explain why these
latest actions by Russia...

13:36.616 --> 13:38.585
Have left us no choice

13:38.618 --> 13:42.489
but to destroy our enemies
before they destroy us.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.293
So, that, uh,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.962
24 hours we promised
Darius and Grace?

13:48.996 --> 13:50.931
The president thinks
it's a waste of time.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.933
You object?

13:52.966 --> 13:56.603
Of course not, but he
needs to prerecord this.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.238
He can't deliver
this speech live.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.107
Why is that?

14:00.140 --> 14:02.109
So, by the time we launch,

14:02.142 --> 14:04.644
he'll already be in the safety
of the contingency shelter.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.179
And his exact location
will be unknown.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.949
The president's safety
is the priority.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.018
I recommend we
clear the West Wing

14:11.051 --> 14:12.953
of all but essential
personnel.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.221
We can't afford
interference

14:14.254 --> 14:17.057
of any kind on the eve
of military action.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.961
I'll take care of it.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.964
Good.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.106
We'll get through this...

14:33.140 --> 14:35.108
together.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.577
Yeah.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.624
(tires screech)

14:52.659 --> 14:55.562
(gulls squawking)

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
(ship horn blows)

15:04.237 --> 15:07.274
Well, they do have
a flare for the dramatic.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.298
(distorted voice):
Hello, Liam.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.400
Darius.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.140
LIAM:
Augmented reality.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.142
I didn't know that kind of tech
was on the market.

15:42.175 --> 15:44.411
It's not yet.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.046
This is my design.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.048
It never went
into production.

15:48.081 --> 15:50.217
Too many headaches,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.652
literal and figurative,
right, Darius?

15:52.685 --> 15:54.054
(chuckles)

15:54.087 --> 15:56.223
You seem to know a lot about me.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.490
Now, this isn't
what I had in mind

15:57.524 --> 15:59.192
when I asked for a face-to-face,

15:59.226 --> 16:00.560
talking to an avatar.

16:00.593 --> 16:04.064
You didn't think I was in D.C.,
did you?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.165
Or am I?

16:05.198 --> 16:07.600
Are you? Aren't you?

16:07.634 --> 16:10.137
You took something from me.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.239
I want it back.

16:12.272 --> 16:15.108
Everyone has a number.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.143
What's yours?

16:16.176 --> 16:17.144
Tess.

16:19.046 --> 16:19.946
I want Tess.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.450
Or her source code,
to be more specific.

16:23.483 --> 16:29.322
RE/SYST is responsible
for the USS Pike, aren't you?

16:32.259 --> 16:33.460
You don't answer,
you get nothing.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.429
Yes, we blew up the Pike.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.098
Why?

16:38.131 --> 16:40.700
They killed us, we killed them.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.369
That leads to nothing good.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.204
It's a vicious cycle.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.206
Now, I'm trying to
de-escalate things,

16:46.239 --> 16:47.507
and I need that probe back

16:47.540 --> 16:49.542
for reasons you probably
already know.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.145
You give me Tess's source code

16:52.179 --> 16:55.648
and I'll relinquish control
of the gravity tractor.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.784
That's the deal
I'm willing to cut.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.719
You have one hour.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.495
The reporter from
Capitol Eyes?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.063
Mm-hmm.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.531
How did she get
ahold of my speech?
I don't know,

17:11.564 --> 17:14.067
but she decoded it
and wrote this article.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.769
Has this been released yet?
Not yet.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.138
(whispering):
Oh, God.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.372
I'm afraid she lost her life

17:19.406 --> 17:20.707
trying to get the truth
out there.

17:20.740 --> 17:24.144
Uh... maybe it's time
to deliver this.

17:24.177 --> 17:28.248
Grace, the world
is on a precipice.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.616
This speech...
(laughs)

17:29.649 --> 17:31.551
...this speech could
send us over the edge.

17:31.584 --> 17:37.290
Or it could pull us back
from the brink, unite us all.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.627
People have died
because of this secret

17:40.660 --> 17:42.595
and-and millions more may
follow. Madam President,

17:42.629 --> 17:46.166
I urge you, no more secrets.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.601
(phone chimes and vibrates)

17:48.635 --> 17:51.571
Madam President, it's time.

17:51.604 --> 17:55.442
"This Russian aggression
will not stand.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.644
"We will endure.
We're built to survive.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.146
"We are the United
States of America.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.847
God bless."

18:00.880 --> 18:04.417
Mr. President, HomeSec has
identified a credible threat

18:04.451 --> 18:05.552
against the White House.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.187
We need to get you
to safety.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.821
Now.
Okay, clear the room.

18:08.855 --> 18:09.856
Sir, we'll move you

18:09.889 --> 18:11.358
to the Presidential
Emergency Operation Center

18:11.391 --> 18:13.326
underneath the West Wing.
Hold on.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.861
He comes or I go nowhere.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.130
HARRIS:
Of course.

18:17.164 --> 18:18.097
Come with us, Major.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.404
Watch your step, sir.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.311
BENNETT:
How far to the Op Center?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.346
HARRIS:
Not too much further.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.450
HUGH:
Mr. President.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.320
Though I suspect not for long.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.454
What the hell is going on here?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.693
You took the
government by force,

18:46.726 --> 18:49.162
now we're taking it back.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.376
HARRIS:
Cuff him.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.880
(grunts)

19:07.914 --> 19:09.382
You'll live to regret this,
Harris.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.318
I'm the president
of the United States.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.885
Illegitimate president.

19:14.354 --> 19:16.756
Pauline Mackenzie
isn't dead.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.825
What?

19:18.858 --> 19:21.694
HUGH: But the good news is,
they'll reduce the charges

19:21.728 --> 19:23.896
against you from first degree
to attempted murder.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.932
Oh, and treason, of course.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.535
You won't be needing these
nuclear codes anymore.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.536
HARRIS:
You, Major.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.238
Come with me.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.305
Major, don't move.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.577
I take my orders

19:37.610 --> 19:38.978
from the president of
the United States, sir.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.549
He's not your president.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.217
He engineered a coup,

19:44.251 --> 19:45.418
and you're aiding and
abetting that, Major,

19:45.452 --> 19:46.653
if you don't
hand over the bag

19:46.686 --> 19:51.258
and come with me,
the secretary of defense, now.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.727
I know this can be
confusing, son, but...

19:54.761 --> 19:57.464
maybe this will help.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.469
LIAM:
Darius, you sure about this?

20:02.502 --> 20:04.604
Giving RE/SYST a computer
as powerful as Tess

20:04.637 --> 20:06.639
is like giving the
Incredible Hulk steroids.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.874
That's a great analogy.

20:07.907 --> 20:08.908
One crisis at a time.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.510
Tess is a computer.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.479
I can always build another one.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.882
We lose control of the gravity
tractor, we lose everything.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.591
All right.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.692
She's coming online now.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.694
Tess, are you there?

20:27.727 --> 20:28.828
TESS:
Yes, Darius.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.331
What can I do for you?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.899
You've done more than enough.
I just...

20:34.634 --> 20:35.935
...wanted to say thank you.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.870
My pleasure, Darius.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.675
They're in.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.690
LIAM: "Pleasure doing
business with you."

21:04.831 --> 21:06.699
Darius.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.035
Darius, look.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.578
SECRETARY: I have no idea
what happened.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.580
They were in here
behind closed doors.

21:20.613 --> 21:21.714
I just followed
orders, ma'am.

21:21.748 --> 21:22.549
Whose orders?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.517
The Defense Secretary
Harris Edwards.

21:24.551 --> 21:26.519
He gave me a file to take
upstairs to the residents.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.621
Get me Secret Service now.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.590
(elevator bell dings)

21:33.493 --> 21:34.527
Wait, hold your fire.

21:34.561 --> 21:35.695
Stop right there.

21:35.728 --> 21:36.929
This area's
in security lockdown.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.601
Good afternoon, everyone.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.603
President Mackenzie?

21:43.636 --> 21:44.904
Alive and well.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.606
HARRIS: And she's ready
to reclaim the presidency.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.741
Now, stand down, soldier.

21:48.775 --> 21:51.010
Afraid I can't do that, sir.
I have orders.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.845
I am the secretary
of defense,

21:52.879 --> 21:55.382
serving the rightful president
of the United States,

21:55.415 --> 21:57.750
and I'm giving
you new ones.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.486
Stand down.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.787
Stop right there, sir.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.090
Lieutenant,
you have a choice to make.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.693
You follow those orders
of yours, you shoot us,

22:06.726 --> 22:08.628
and live with the fact that
you handed the country over

22:08.661 --> 22:09.829
to a coup.

22:09.862 --> 22:13.766
Or you honor your oath
to protect America

22:13.800 --> 22:16.636
from all enemies,
foreign and domestic,

22:16.669 --> 22:19.839
and you help us
take back our country.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.340
Your call.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.480
The gravity tractor.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.683
We have control.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.819
It worked.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.621
Don't celebrate just yet.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.788
(typing)

22:35.822 --> 22:37.690
The asteroid's iron core.

22:37.724 --> 22:40.993
We didn't account
for its density.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.596
Plug that new variable in and...

22:43.630 --> 22:45.898
And th-the gravity tractor's
mass may not be great enough

22:45.932 --> 22:48.134
to move Samson
off its course. Oh...

22:48.167 --> 22:49.736
But the GT's already up there.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.704
There's nothing we can
do about that now.

22:51.738 --> 22:52.805
There's always a way.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.841
We just...
need to find it.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.677
Run every calculation,
every permutation

22:57.710 --> 22:59.512
with that iron-core variable.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.013
(door bangs open)

23:04.851 --> 23:05.818
Pauline?

23:05.852 --> 23:06.986
It's me.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.788
And it's Madam President,

23:08.821 --> 23:09.789
Admiral.

23:09.822 --> 23:10.890
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:10.923 --> 23:12.825
Monroe Bennett tried
to poison me

23:12.859 --> 23:15.828
in a not-so-bloodless coup.

23:15.862 --> 23:18.698
Please.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.667
In accordance
with the 25th Amendment,

23:20.700 --> 23:21.834
Pauline Mackenzie
has been given

23:21.868 --> 23:24.170
medical clearance
by her physician,

23:24.203 --> 23:26.172
and is submitting her
request to be reinstated

23:26.205 --> 23:28.775
as President
of the United States.

23:28.808 --> 23:29.776
As secretary of defense,

23:29.809 --> 23:31.678
I fully recognize

23:31.711 --> 23:34.681
the legitimacy
of the Mackenzie presidency.

23:34.714 --> 23:37.650
And I would advise all of us
to do the same.

23:37.684 --> 23:40.019
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:40.052 --> 23:42.755
it's do-or-die time.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.893
I need to know where
your allegiances lie.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.948
(tires screeching)

24:11.651 --> 24:13.620
We've cleared and secured
this level for you, ma'am.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.087
All video surveillance
has been turned off.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.223
To the White House.

24:17.256 --> 24:20.560
I need to address the nation
from the Oval Office.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.662
Mr. Secretary, I want you
to arrest Monroe Bennett

24:22.695 --> 24:24.030
and Claire Rayburn for treason.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.932
You're the only one
I trust to bring them in.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.134
It will be my pleasure.

24:29.836 --> 24:33.105
Grace, this may be the most
important speech

24:33.139 --> 24:37.243
I or any president
has ever given.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.778
I want you to write it.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.013
I'd be honored.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.782
(van doors open)

24:42.815 --> 24:44.150
(van engines start)

24:45.785 --> 24:47.186
(tires screech)

24:50.089 --> 24:51.791
(sighs)

24:51.824 --> 24:53.292
You still breathing?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.961
Yeah. You?

24:56.729 --> 25:01.300
Mr. Secretary,
you're a real patriot.

25:01.333 --> 25:03.536
You as well, Ms. Barrows.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.567
(pistol cocks)

25:35.968 --> 25:38.070
You used me.

25:43.309 --> 25:45.177
Claire, put the gun down.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.879
It's over.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.014
I know what you did.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.017
I did what was necessary

25:51.050 --> 25:52.284
to save this country
from threats

25:52.318 --> 25:54.721
most people couldn't
even imagine.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.957
You poisoned a sitting president
to start a war.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.359
Mackenzie was too weak,

26:00.392 --> 26:04.664
too unwilling to
make the hard calls.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.198
And now, it seems,
so are you.

26:06.232 --> 26:09.101
I never meant to hurt you,
Claire.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.871
Please.
Don't flatter yourself.

26:13.339 --> 26:16.142
It's always been country
first for me, Harris.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.277
And you're a traitor.

26:18.310 --> 26:20.613
Which is why you have to die.
Wait...

26:21.047 --> 26:22.014
(grunts)

26:22.048 --> 26:24.817
(shell clatters)

26:24.851 --> 26:26.753
(breathing rapidly)

26:46.739 --> 26:48.941
(exhales)

26:48.975 --> 26:53.379
FYI, I have skills other
than body disposal.

26:54.747 --> 26:58.350
You do know you saved
Harris's life, don't you?

26:58.384 --> 26:59.852
You did.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.921
(phone ringing)

27:03.856 --> 27:05.725
This is Harris.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.261
I'm on my way.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.331
The Russian aircraft carrier
Reka Volga just exploded

27:12.364 --> 27:14.233
and sank
off the coast of Finland.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.435
Russia believes
we torpedoed her,

27:16.468 --> 27:19.739
and her military just moved
to Condition One.

27:19.772 --> 27:21.373
That means war.

27:21.407 --> 27:24.877
Mackenzie's got to make
her reappearance now.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.379
I need to get home,
see your mom.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.916
Dad, wait.
Zoe's gonna be fine.
I put her in contact

27:29.949 --> 27:32.051
with a friend of mine
at the embassy.

27:32.084 --> 27:34.086
I love you.

27:44.931 --> 27:47.133
HARRIS:
Madam President,
there's troop movements

27:47.166 --> 27:47.834
along the Polish border.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.235
Russian subs have been detected

27:49.268 --> 27:50.970
coming up to firing depth.

27:51.003 --> 27:54.106
Mr. Secretary, are we sure
that RE/SYST is the culprit?

27:54.140 --> 27:56.743
Most definitely,
Madam President.

27:56.776 --> 27:57.944
Mr. Tanz.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.279
They used a hack to overheat
the ship's own reactor core,

28:00.312 --> 28:02.148
just like they did to the Pike.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.449
Darius has computer logs
from the Pike--

28:03.482 --> 28:05.217
hard and fast data
we can show the Russians.

28:05.251 --> 28:07.820
No, if it comes from us,
they won't believe a word of it.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.221
Not that we can blame them
at this point.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.990
What do they want, Mr. Tanz?

28:11.023 --> 28:13.392
RE/SYST seems hell-bent on
Russia and the United States...

28:13.425 --> 28:15.361
annihilating each other.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.930
We need to go public quickly.

28:17.964 --> 28:20.199
I need to address the nation.
The world.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.902
Madam President, if I may,
a word in private with you,

28:22.935 --> 28:25.004
Mr. Secretary, and Ms. Barrows.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.940
Michael, clear the room, please.

28:27.974 --> 28:29.976
HARRIS:
An ark?

28:31.043 --> 28:32.779
For 160 people?

28:32.812 --> 28:35.181
Yes, a hundred meters
underground.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.216
The hangar is fully equipped
to sustain life

28:37.249 --> 28:38.484
for several years in the event

28:38.517 --> 28:40.052
of a nuclear attack,
and...

28:40.086 --> 28:42.188
the Ark is prepared
to go into space

28:42.221 --> 28:43.790
should the need arise.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.224
And you're suggesting
we go there

28:45.257 --> 28:48.027
and circumvent
all White House protocol?

28:48.060 --> 28:50.396
We don't yet have
a fool-proof solution

28:50.429 --> 28:52.098
to our asteroid problem,

28:52.131 --> 28:54.533
and if a nuclear attack
forces us underground

28:54.566 --> 28:57.236
for more than
a hundred days, well...

28:57.269 --> 29:01.040
an escape route...
may be necessary.

29:01.073 --> 29:04.110
Darius, there's protocol
in place.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.012
Of course.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.147
I-I just want you
to know that...

29:08.180 --> 29:11.083
there is a space for all of you.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.154
I leave it in your hands.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.427
We're ready in five, four,

29:21.460 --> 29:24.196
three, two...

29:24.230 --> 29:25.998
My fellow Americans,

29:26.032 --> 29:28.134
in the words of Mark Twain,

29:28.167 --> 29:31.470
"Reports of my death
are greatly exaggerated."

29:31.503 --> 29:33.205
What I'm about
to tell you

29:33.239 --> 29:35.141
may come as a shock.

29:35.174 --> 29:38.210
I was poisoned
in an attempted coup

29:38.244 --> 29:40.046
led by Vice President Bennett.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.048
And it's only
through the heroic actions

29:42.081 --> 29:44.183
taken by a handful of patriots

29:44.216 --> 29:47.453
(chuckles wryly):
that I am still here.

29:47.486 --> 29:51.323
But rest assured,
this despicable coup

29:51.357 --> 29:55.027
has been put down,
and I am now in full control.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.495
Our most pressing problem

29:56.528 --> 29:59.832
right now is
the deteriorating
state of relations

29:59.866 --> 30:02.168
between Russia
and the United States.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.937
What I want to say to
our Russian friends,

30:04.971 --> 30:07.273
in no uncertain terms:

30:07.306 --> 30:10.242
our true enemy
is not each other,

30:10.276 --> 30:14.213
but the hacker group
known as RE/SYST.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.416
RE/SYST was behind the attack
on the USS Pike

30:17.449 --> 30:20.920
and now
the Russian carrier Volga.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.023
We don't need
to fight each other.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.525
We must unite to fight RE/SYST.

30:26.558 --> 30:27.860
(elevator bell dings)

30:27.894 --> 30:29.295
Now, the illegal actions
(gunshots)

30:29.328 --> 30:30.897
of Vice President Bennett

30:30.930 --> 30:33.900
have greatly compounded
an already dangerous situation.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.868
But I want to urge people

30:35.902 --> 30:38.270
all over this world
to take a pause,

30:38.304 --> 30:39.906
give us a chance

30:39.939 --> 30:42.508
to talk, so that cooler heads

30:42.541 --> 30:44.243
may prevail.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.411
Because...

30:45.444 --> 30:47.546
my fellow Americans,

30:47.579 --> 30:51.517
the worst to befall us
has yet to come.

30:51.550 --> 30:54.386
And that is why
I must tell you the truth.

30:54.420 --> 30:58.324
In approximately
128 days, an...

30:58.357 --> 31:00.326
(electronic squeaking, static)
What's happening?

31:01.660 --> 31:03.229
What the hell is happening?
Are we still live?

31:03.262 --> 31:05.097
COMPUTER VOICE: This message
is being disseminated

31:05.131 --> 31:07.066
by the United States government.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.667
At 3:40 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time,

31:08.700 --> 31:12.138
NORAD detected
four long-range nuclear missiles

31:12.171 --> 31:15.241
believed to be headed
for the Washington, D.C. area.

31:15.274 --> 31:19.278
All residents within
a 400-mile radius of this area

31:19.311 --> 31:21.313
should evacuate.
TANZ: People, people, people,
don't panic.

31:21.347 --> 31:22.648
Calm down, calm down.

31:22.681 --> 31:25.684
We need to usher as many
of our people down
to the office as we can.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.520
Now. Th-There's a safe place
for you here at Tanz.

31:28.554 --> 31:29.989
This way, down the back.
Let's go...
Move.

31:30.022 --> 31:32.024
(overlapping chatter)

31:39.131 --> 31:40.532
Mr. Secretary, I just got
off the phone with NORAD.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.700
There is confirmation

31:41.733 --> 31:43.970
of four intercontinental
ballistic missiles,

31:44.003 --> 31:46.038
incoming,
from three different sources.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.373
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:47.406 --> 31:51.010
we are under attack.

31:51.043 --> 31:53.279
Madam President, we've launched
the GMD intercept missiles

31:53.312 --> 31:56.648
as a defensive action
to shoot down as many
inbound as we can.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.584
But that's no guarantee
of total success.

32:00.486 --> 32:03.389
Look, we can stay
defensive...

32:03.422 --> 32:05.524
or we can launch our own.

32:05.557 --> 32:06.592
That's...

32:06.625 --> 32:09.595
mutually assured destruction.

32:09.628 --> 32:13.099
Madam President,
we need to make a decision.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.500
Now.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.339
(zipper opens)

32:36.488 --> 32:38.090
(beeping)

32:39.525 --> 32:41.493
This is General Vierling
at NORAD.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.130
Gold codes are verified.
What are your orders, ma'am?

32:44.163 --> 32:46.999
Is there any chance
that this might be a mistake?

32:47.033 --> 32:51.303
Or a move by RE/SYST to make
this look like a Russian attack?

32:51.337 --> 32:53.039
No, ma'am, confidence is high.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.343
AGENT: Madam President,
we have 27 minutes.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.212
We need to get you all
to the command bunker, now.

33:00.246 --> 33:01.647
All right, everyone.
To the bunker.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.316
Not you, Harris.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.085
Or you, Ms. Barrows.

33:06.118 --> 33:07.653
Excuse me?

33:08.820 --> 33:11.557
Marine One is standing by
on the South Lawn,

33:11.590 --> 33:13.559
to take the both of you to Tanz.

33:13.592 --> 33:14.626
To that ark.

33:14.660 --> 33:15.361
HARRIS:
Madam President,

33:15.394 --> 33:16.628
you're not thinking this
through.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.664
Oh, I am, Mr. Secretary.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.432
I will safeguard
this nation.

33:20.466 --> 33:24.236
But you must
safeguard humanity.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.339
And that is an order.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.147
We understand.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.684
Yes, ma'am.

33:41.353 --> 33:42.554
Good luck.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.363
(door opens)

33:51.397 --> 33:52.731
Madam President,

33:52.764 --> 33:54.800
what are your orders?

33:54.833 --> 33:56.135
JILLIAN:
...three, four.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.169
Thank you. Hi.

33:57.203 --> 33:58.537
You guys, keep going.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.707
Six, eight, nine, ten.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.543
Wait, hold, hold, hold,
hold. Elevator's full.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.112
LIAM:
Single file.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.546
Let's go, come on.

34:07.579 --> 34:08.547
Keep moving, guys.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.216
How many down so far?
Keep going, keep going.

34:10.249 --> 34:11.650
104.
Darius,

34:11.683 --> 34:13.085
I need to
talk to you.

34:13.119 --> 34:14.620
There's no time.

34:14.653 --> 34:16.388
Darius, there's no time left
to have this conversation.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.524
I got to talk to you
right now.

34:18.557 --> 34:19.725
Darius.

34:19.758 --> 34:20.592
Darius,
the genetic testing.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.760
Yeah, I didn't pass it.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.297
Wait, you-you... you know.

34:25.331 --> 34:26.665
Why did you...

34:26.698 --> 34:28.267
Leadership is difficult.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.836
It's about having
to make hard decisions.

34:30.869 --> 34:34.406
When to hold information,
when to pass it on.

34:36.142 --> 34:39.745
The burden, it won't... be easy.

34:39.778 --> 34:43.115
You never planned
on going on the Ark.

34:45.151 --> 34:48.120
You'll be surrounded
by the finest scientists,

34:48.154 --> 34:49.855
doctors, engineers.

34:49.888 --> 34:52.724
In the meantime, I'll be working
on the iron core problem.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.726
God willing,

34:54.760 --> 34:58.497
whatever hits the East Coast
won't destroy us all.

35:00.766 --> 35:03.235
(sniffles)

35:03.269 --> 35:05.404
Though not always a pleasure...

35:05.437 --> 35:07.639
(chuckles)

35:07.673 --> 35:09.775
...it's been a true honor, sir.

35:09.808 --> 35:11.810
Likewise.

35:27.693 --> 35:30.262
(helicopter approaching)

35:48.847 --> 35:51.450
Holy crap.

35:51.483 --> 35:54.820
(chuckles softly)
Darius, you don't disappoint.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.588
TANZ: I have a
former astronaut

35:56.622 --> 35:58.890
who can pilot this
if it comes to that.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.860
I'm sure he'll benefit
from your expertise.

36:01.893 --> 36:04.563
We have less than ten minutes
to seal these doors.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.897
With Tess off-line, I'll
have to do it manually

36:05.931 --> 36:07.299
from inside Tanz.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.270
Wait, you're not staying?

36:11.303 --> 36:12.904
No.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.706
You'll have everything you need.

36:14.740 --> 36:16.375
For years to come.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.812
I need some air.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.851
(sighs)

36:36.895 --> 36:38.364
Grace?

36:43.001 --> 36:45.371
Grace?

36:46.938 --> 36:48.240
Why?

36:48.274 --> 36:51.410
I have a hereditary disease.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.644
Huntington's.

36:52.678 --> 36:54.646
I've been working
with researchers

36:54.680 --> 36:57.949
to find a way to
shut the gene off, but...

36:57.983 --> 37:01.753
science hasn't caught up with me
as of yet.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.522
Who gives a damn?
You're healthy now.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.692
We need you in there,
Darius, you can't

37:06.725 --> 37:08.394
just abandon us like that.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.795
You don't need me in there.
Well, then,

37:09.828 --> 37:11.297
I-I want you in there.

37:18.804 --> 37:20.639
(softly):
I want you.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.514
(crying):
I want to be with you.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.850
I don't care where.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.952
*

37:44.095 --> 37:45.531
Grace.

37:45.564 --> 37:49.535
Those people
need you in there.

37:49.568 --> 37:52.938
He needs you.

37:52.971 --> 37:56.508
What I said to you
that night at the embassy,

37:56.542 --> 37:59.345
that you were
extraordinary...

37:59.378 --> 38:02.013
(laughs)
In an ordinary way.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.616
(both laugh)

38:04.650 --> 38:08.053
I was wrong.

38:08.086 --> 38:11.056
You're extraordinary,
full stop.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.724
A born leader.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.893
It's time to lead.

38:16.928 --> 38:20.466
(sighs)

38:20.499 --> 38:23.068
We took it all
for granted.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.006
(sighs)

38:28.039 --> 38:29.641
We did.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.416
Go.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.919
(quietly):
Go.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.727
TANZ:
My friends...

38:48.760 --> 38:52.030
if you're listening to this,

38:52.063 --> 38:53.765
I'm afraid it's
because the human race

38:53.799 --> 38:56.067
has gotten itself into...

38:56.101 --> 38:58.937
well, a bit of a pickle.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.975
But if you look around you,
you will soon learn

39:04.009 --> 39:08.480
that you are among the best
and the brightest.

39:08.514 --> 39:12.818
You are surrounded by the best
of what makes us human:

39:12.851 --> 39:14.986
art, literature,

39:15.020 --> 39:18.890
music, history.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.026
Because this hangar
is air gapped,

39:21.059 --> 39:23.895
you will have no contact with
the outside world for 30 days.

39:23.929 --> 39:28.400
In the event that the planet
has become uninhabitable,

39:28.434 --> 39:30.702
the Ark that stands behind you

39:30.736 --> 39:33.038
can carry 160 people into orbit

39:33.071 --> 39:36.842
with enough supplies
to last three years.

39:36.875 --> 39:40.912
Darkness has descended
upon us like...

39:40.946 --> 39:42.948
a cloud.

39:44.950 --> 39:49.521
But as a wise man once said...

39:49.555 --> 39:53.124
"Even in darkness,
there is light."

39:55.961 --> 39:58.797
(people whispering indistinctly)

40:01.633 --> 40:03.602
I can't change what happens,
but...

40:03.635 --> 40:05.604
(chuckles)

40:05.637 --> 40:07.973
I can change the ambience.

40:12.210 --> 40:15.481
(people muttering indistinctly)

40:15.514 --> 40:18.049
("Fly Me to the Moon"
by Frank Sinatra playing)

40:21.820 --> 40:25.457
* Fly me to the moon

40:25.491 --> 40:29.495
* Let me play among the stars

40:29.528 --> 40:31.630
* Let me see...

40:31.663 --> 40:35.066
What does he expect us to do?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.135
* Jupiter and Mars...

40:37.168 --> 40:39.137
Dance.

40:39.170 --> 40:41.072
* In other words

40:41.106 --> 40:43.141
* Hold my hand...

40:43.174 --> 40:44.676
He wants us to dance.

40:44.710 --> 40:47.579
* In other words

40:47.613 --> 40:52.183
* Baby, kiss me

40:54.185 --> 40:57.088
* Fill my heart with song

40:57.122 --> 41:01.993
* And let me sing forevermore

41:02.027 --> 41:05.531
* You are all I long for

41:05.564 --> 41:09.601
* All I worship and adore

41:09.635 --> 41:13.071
* In other words...

41:13.104 --> 41:15.841
You're right.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.076
Fear can't paralyze us.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.079
It has to motivate us...

41:21.112 --> 41:22.948
keep us together.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.156
Like magnets.

41:36.795 --> 41:38.697
Jillian.

41:38.730 --> 41:42.634
Jillian, I need to tell
Darius something right now

41:42.668 --> 41:44.102
before it's too late.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.637
Wait, you can't leave.

41:45.671 --> 41:47.205
You'll be locked out.

41:47.238 --> 41:49.140
I'm sorry.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.609
No.
I'm sorry.
I got to go.

41:50.642 --> 41:52.277
I love you so much.
I love you so much.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.713
(under breath):
I got to go.

41:54.746 --> 41:55.947
I got to go.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.917
* Let me sing forevermore...

41:58.950 --> 42:00.952
Liam.

42:02.287 --> 42:05.724
* You are all I long for

42:05.757 --> 42:10.629
* All I worship and adore

42:10.662 --> 42:13.565
* In other words

42:13.599 --> 42:18.169
* Please be true

42:18.203 --> 42:20.906
* In other words

42:20.939 --> 42:23.274
* In other

42:23.308 --> 42:27.045
* Words

42:27.078 --> 42:31.216
* I love

42:34.319 --> 42:36.321
* You.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.171
LIAM:
Hey!

42:53.204 --> 42:54.272
Darius!

42:54.305 --> 42:55.707
Liam.

42:57.809 --> 43:01.680
The iron core--
I know what to do.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.281
There's still hope.
