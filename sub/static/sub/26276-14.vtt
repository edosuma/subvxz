00:05.701 --> 00:08.791
[Zeus and Apollo growling]

00:12.099 --> 00:13.317
Higgins.

00:13.361 --> 00:14.405
[growling continues]

00:14.449 --> 00:15.406
Higgins!

00:15.450 --> 00:17.713
Zeus, Apollo, sit.

00:17.756 --> 00:19.062
[Zeus and Apollo whine]

00:21.021 --> 00:22.283
You do realize
that eating in bed

00:22.326 --> 00:23.240
leads to insomnia.[vacuum cleaner whirring]

00:23.284 --> 00:25.329
I sleep just fine.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.591
And it attracts insects.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.028
I'm not afraid of ants
and roaches.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.768
These hounds of hell,
on the other hand...

00:29.812 --> 00:31.161
[Zeus and Apollo growl][whirring stops]

00:31.205 --> 00:33.598
Zeus, Apollo, outside.

00:33.642 --> 00:34.599
[barks]

00:35.992 --> 00:38.342
Roll over.[grunts]

00:38.386 --> 00:40.127
Good boy.
[chuckles]

00:40.997 --> 00:42.607
Do we really have
to do this now?

00:42.651 --> 00:44.653
Well, roaches and ants may
not bother you, Magnum,

00:44.696 --> 00:45.958
but they bother me.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.699
It's bad enough that
you're sleeping out here.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.572
It's not my fault the guesthouse
is full of termite damage.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.400
This house has eight bedrooms,

00:52.443 --> 00:55.359
and yet you choose to sleep
on a sofa in the common area.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.969
It's really comfy out here.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.536
I give up.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.235
There is just no point trying
to reason with a toddler.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.801
Oh, and a package

01:02.845 --> 01:05.543
came for you this morning.
It's in the study.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.155
And for the love of God,
put some trousers on.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.680
[sighs]

01:14.552 --> 01:16.815
MAGNUM:
Usually, when a lawyer wants
to reach you,

01:16.859 --> 01:17.773
it's bad news.

01:17.816 --> 01:18.991
But if he's reaching out

01:19.035 --> 01:20.471
on behalf
of a potential client,

01:20.515 --> 01:22.299
that could mean a job.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.696
[footsteps approaching]

01:29.393 --> 01:31.352
That's a lot of cash.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.223
It's $10,000.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.659
Why on earth
would anyone send so much?

01:34.703 --> 01:35.878
I don't know,
but this came with it.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.140
You mind if I use the laptop?Sure.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.272
That'll be $50.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.753
[chuckles] Are you
seriously gonna charge me?

01:41.797 --> 01:44.887
You promised to purchase
your own laptop months ago,

01:44.930 --> 01:46.454
and it still hasn't
happened. As such,

01:46.497 --> 01:48.804
now every time
you want to use my laptop,

01:48.847 --> 01:50.240
the charge is $50.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.589
That's a little extreme.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.461
That is my price.
Either you can get your own,

01:53.504 --> 01:54.810
or you can, as you Yanks

01:54.853 --> 01:57.291
are so fond of
saying, make it rain.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.335
You have any change?

01:58.379 --> 02:00.207
I'll just keep it. Thank you.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.774
No doubt you'll need to borrow
my laptop again in the future.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.168
By the way, you still owe me
for the repairs on the Ferrari.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.169
I know.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.172
Mr. Magnum, hello.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.435
My name is Larry Hayes.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.959
You don't know me, but I'm
reaching out to you for help.

02:14.003 --> 02:16.179
I've tried everything.
No one will listen.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.833
No one will believe me.

02:17.876 --> 02:21.315
At first I thought I was just
being followed, being watched.

02:21.358 --> 02:24.056
But it's clear now that it's
much more serious than that.

02:25.101 --> 02:27.451
Someone's after me, Mr. Magnum.

02:28.452 --> 02:32.108
They want to hurt me, I know it.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.719
And if you're
watching this now...

02:34.763 --> 02:38.158
I'm hiring you
to solve my murder.

02:44.512 --> 02:46.514
â™ª

03:04.619 --> 03:07.709
KUMU:
Careful with that. And watch where you're walking.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.450
MAN:
Auntie, please,

03:09.493 --> 03:11.408
we're trained
pest management professionals.

03:11.452 --> 03:14.890
Who are about to pump this place
full of poison.

03:14.933 --> 03:18.285
Look around. We have
valuable artifacts in here.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.069
Plus, we have animals
on the property.

03:20.112 --> 03:23.115
I need more than just your word
that everything will be okay.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.508
RICK:
Knock, knock.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.249
What seems to be the problem?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.991
Rick, did these guys
come through you?

03:29.034 --> 03:30.949
Yeah, uh, Higgy
asked me to help out

03:30.993 --> 03:32.690
with Thomas's termite issues

03:32.734 --> 03:34.039
that he's having,
so I called my buddy.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.128
Dennis Sterling.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.869
Teuila.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.436
[chuckles]You guys know each other?

03:39.480 --> 03:41.221
We went to high
school together.

03:41.264 --> 03:43.875
Haven't seen each other
in what, 15 years?

03:43.919 --> 03:45.486
Uh, give or take.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.792
RICK: Okay, looks like you kids
have some catching up to do.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.577
You still look
the same, though.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.014
[laughs]:
Oh, stop.

03:52.057 --> 03:53.233
Okay, go on.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.235
[chuckles]:
What's the holdup?

03:57.280 --> 04:00.022
[sighs] I'm concerned
about your chemicals.

04:00.065 --> 04:01.893
DENNIS:
You don't have to worry.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.983
There's no residue,
and as long as we aerate

04:05.027 --> 04:07.899
and do a clearance test,
this process is perfectly safe.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.598
But to be careful,

04:10.641 --> 04:13.165
these gentlemen
will carefully remove

04:13.209 --> 04:16.038
whatever items you want
and put them in the garage.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.823
Guys, Teuila's in charge.

04:18.867 --> 04:21.696
Nothing happens until she
gives the green light.

04:21.739 --> 04:22.914
Mahalo, Dennis.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.046
Wow. Well,

04:24.089 --> 04:25.700
looks like my work here is done.

04:25.743 --> 04:27.136
Um, you know,

04:27.179 --> 04:29.225
since you guys have to clear
everything out of here,

04:29.269 --> 04:30.922
I'm-a go ahead and take this.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.315
Uh, you know, if Magnum asks,

04:32.359 --> 04:35.013
just, uh, tell him
it's for the bajillion favors

04:35.057 --> 04:37.189
that he owes me for. Mahalo.

04:37.233 --> 04:39.844
I'm sorry to be so difficult.

04:39.888 --> 04:41.498
[laughs]:
You still haven't changed.

04:41.542 --> 04:43.587
You still have that fire in you.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.850
So, listen, I have

04:45.894 --> 04:47.199
to head over to
another job site,

04:47.243 --> 04:50.725
but I will be back to
check on everything.

04:50.768 --> 04:51.813
Sounds good.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.206
Okay.

04:54.250 --> 04:57.166
Okay, boys. Let's do this.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.821
LARRY:
I've tried everything.

04:59.864 --> 05:02.302
No one will listen.
No one will believe me.

05:02.345 --> 05:05.696
At first I thought I was just
being followed, being watched.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.046
But it's clear now
that it's much more serious

05:08.090 --> 05:09.700
than that.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.267
Any answers?

05:11.311 --> 05:14.705
Yeah, I just spoke
to the law firm that sent this.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.491
They handled Larry's mother's
affairs after her death.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.188
They hadn't heard from Larry
until last week

05:19.231 --> 05:20.972
when he asked them
to send me this envelope

05:21.016 --> 05:22.278
in the event of his death,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.236
which apparently happened
12 hours ago.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.977
It was a car accident.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.501
Well, that's a little curious.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.937
That's more
than a little curious.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.852
I mean, this guy's convinced
somebody's after him,

05:30.895 --> 05:32.244
and then he ends up dead.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.334
I mean, there's got to be
a connection there.

05:34.377 --> 05:38.207
One thing I don't understand
is why Mr. Hayes hired you

05:38.250 --> 05:40.340
to investigate his
murder specifically.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.733
'Cause I'm good.Debatable.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.082
[chuckles softly]

05:44.126 --> 05:45.345
I'm leaving.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.607
Seriously. I mean,
I can understand

05:46.650 --> 05:47.956
someone wanting to
engage your services

05:47.999 --> 05:49.871
if the only compensation
they could offer was...

05:49.914 --> 05:51.960
I don't know, live poultry.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.527
But it appears money
was no object.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.312
Surely Mr. Hayes could have
hired someone more reputable.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.358
But he chose you. Why?

05:58.401 --> 05:59.663
I don't know.

05:59.707 --> 06:03.058
But he did, so I'm obliged
to look into this.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.582
Magnum, you-you know
that twice as many people

06:05.626 --> 06:07.410
die in car accidents
as homicides.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.369
I'm not saying
I'm not intrigued by all this,

06:09.412 --> 06:11.283
but have you considered
the possibility

06:11.327 --> 06:12.720
that it is just a coincidence?

06:12.763 --> 06:16.593
Like any good detective,
I don't believe in coincidences.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.426
I still don't really know
why I'm here.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.167
My assistant said that you had

06:25.210 --> 06:27.996
information about my brother?Yes.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.911
I know this may sound strange,
Katrina,

06:29.954 --> 06:32.348
but your brother hired me
to solve his murder.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.611
I'm sorry.

06:36.352 --> 06:40.095
Uh, this morning I received
a video he made for me.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.227
He thought somebody
was out to kill him.

06:44.273 --> 06:47.015
Are you saying that what
happened wasn't an accident?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.320
Well, we're not
saying that,

06:48.364 --> 06:51.411
but the timing of it
is suspicious.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.371
I can't believe this. I...

06:59.288 --> 07:02.378
Last week Larry said

07:02.422 --> 07:04.815
that he thought someone
was watching him.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.296
He wouldn't leave his apartment.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.645
The only reason
he left yesterday--

07:08.689 --> 07:11.605
because he felt sick
and he needed to see the doctor.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.347
I thought he was being paranoid.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.741
That he was having
delusions again.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.308
What do you mean?

07:19.351 --> 07:23.443
Larry was... schizophrenic.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.314
If he was off his meds,

07:25.357 --> 07:27.621
he would sometimes see things,

07:27.664 --> 07:29.274
hear things.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.234
You don't think that this time
it could've been for real?

07:32.277 --> 07:34.018
Well, we won't
know for sure

07:34.062 --> 07:36.020
until we look into this.You have to.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.674
Please.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.111
What if he was right all along
and I just didn't believe him?

07:40.155 --> 07:41.330
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

07:43.593 --> 07:47.379
At this point, it's very likely
that it was just a car accident.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.251
And if it wasn't?

07:49.294 --> 07:51.383
Well, if it wasn't, then
we'll do what Larry hired us

07:51.427 --> 07:52.907
to do in the first place.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.256
We'll solve his murder.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.440
MAGNUM:
Okay, according
to the police report,

08:04.484 --> 08:05.485
Larry lost control here

08:05.528 --> 08:07.835
and then slid off
into the ravine.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.534
Does that furrowed brow

08:11.578 --> 08:14.972
constitute a conflicting thought
or the need for a potty break?

08:16.583 --> 08:17.497
I'm thinking maybe someone

08:17.540 --> 08:19.586
forced him off the road.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.631
Perhaps.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.634
But it's a single lane
going in one direction,

08:24.678 --> 08:26.331
so that would've
been difficult.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.333
And plus, there's only
one set of skid marks.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.858
All signs point
to it being an accident.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.122
Not if somebody tampered
with the car.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.341
And how do you intend
to find that out?

08:36.385 --> 08:38.343
The police must have impounded
the car by now.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.086
Really appreciate this, Mikey.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.958
Car's in the back.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.656
Only got an hour.
Does that buy you enough time?

08:46.700 --> 08:49.833
Please. This'll take
30 minutes, tops.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.705
Don't hold your breath

08:51.748 --> 08:54.098
on Magnum reimbursing you
for that hundred, by the way.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.360
What are you talking about?

08:55.404 --> 08:56.623
He promised
he was gonna pay me back.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.538
[laughs]:
When will you learn, man?

08:58.581 --> 09:01.584
Thomas never has more
than 40 bucks to his name.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.673
Welcome to the
club, Shammy.

09:03.717 --> 09:05.283
What club is that?

09:05.327 --> 09:08.460
The Do Free Favors for
Thomas Magnum Club.

09:08.504 --> 09:11.072
Working for me,
you get an honorary membership.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.334
Yeah, lucky me.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.683
I'm not worried about the money

09:13.727 --> 09:16.556
'cause I know this client
paid him ten stacks

09:16.599 --> 09:18.819
just to take the case, so he's
got no excuse not to pay up.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.211
Hold up. $10,000?

09:20.255 --> 09:21.256
[whistles]Mm-hmm.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.779
Thomas ain't mention that.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.259
RICK: Yeah, probably 'cause
he knows you're gonna want him

09:24.302 --> 09:26.130
to reimburse you
for all the fuel costs

09:26.174 --> 09:28.263
that have been stacking up,
helping him out with his cases.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.134
That's what I'm thinking.

09:30.178 --> 09:32.920
Damn.Is this it?

09:32.963 --> 09:34.095
Yeah, that's the one.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.792
You up, doctor.

09:37.794 --> 09:40.623
I really thought I had a shot
at being prom king that year.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.670
Not with that beige tux,
you didn't.Wait a minute now.

09:43.713 --> 09:46.063
It was pale gold,
and I only wore it

09:46.107 --> 09:47.717
to match Kalea's dress.

09:47.761 --> 09:48.892
[both laugh]

09:48.936 --> 09:50.677
Oh, look, there she is.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.809
How's she doing?

09:52.853 --> 09:56.465
Actually, we're divorced now.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.251
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

10:00.295 --> 10:01.775
Well, it's pretty recent.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.168
[chuckles]:
Still can't bring myself

10:04.212 --> 10:06.388
to take this thing off.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.611
Hey, do you remember
those parties I used to throw

10:11.654 --> 10:13.395
when my parents were
on the mainland?

10:13.438 --> 10:15.658
How could I forget?

10:15.702 --> 10:18.226
Well, I have moved
back into that house

10:18.269 --> 10:19.749
since they passed away,

10:19.793 --> 10:24.275
and whenever I'm on the lanai,
I think about those days.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.842
Yeah.

10:25.886 --> 10:29.193
I had the biggest crush on you.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.152
[laughing]:
Oh, stop.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.632
You loved all the ladies.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.504
I'm embarrassed
by the way I used to be.

10:35.547 --> 10:39.029
Well, you certainly
have changed a lot.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.989
Thank you.

10:45.775 --> 10:47.603
Listen, um,

10:47.647 --> 10:50.650
you think you might want to--

10:50.693 --> 10:53.827
uh, I don't know--
get together sometime?

10:55.872 --> 10:59.223
Oh, no, I couldn't.

11:00.877 --> 11:04.925
It-It's just, uh...

11:04.968 --> 11:07.536
my husband was the
love of my life.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.670
I... I haven't even thought
about dating anyone

11:10.713 --> 11:12.497
since he passed.

11:12.541 --> 11:15.152
I understand.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.372
Tell you what.

11:17.415 --> 11:20.854
It's a... open invitation.

11:20.897 --> 11:24.335
I would really just love
to reconnect.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.163
I mean that.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.297
I'll think about it.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.170
Well, I'd better get going.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.172
Um, thanks for the coffee.Okay.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.174
Listen, you can
hang onto this.
Oh.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.089
And I will pick it up

11:39.133 --> 11:41.570
when I come back
to get the tent.
Okay.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.189
â™ª

11:52.233 --> 11:55.062
[engine revving]

11:57.238 --> 11:59.370
MAGNUM:
Are you sure?

11:59.414 --> 12:01.546
SHAMMY:
Dude, I ran a full diagnostic
on this thing.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.765
It's clean.

12:02.809 --> 12:04.811
Steering, brakes,
tires, everything?

12:04.854 --> 12:06.856
They all check out.
Nothing was tampered with.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.380
Okay. Well, thanks for
checking it out for me, Shammy.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.687
I appreciate it.
I'll talk to you guys later.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.516
TC:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, Thomas. One more thing.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.300
Heard about your big payday.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.388
Got me thinking.

12:17.432 --> 12:19.608
Maybe it's time
for you to finally

12:19.651 --> 12:21.131
pay me back
for all that free flying

12:21.175 --> 12:23.177
I do for you
any time you have a case.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.135
You want to charge
me for that?

12:25.179 --> 12:28.573
[scoffs]
It's $450 to fill up my tank.

12:28.617 --> 12:30.488
Of course I want
to charge you.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.229
Yeah, but I thought
you enjoyed it.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.622
Why would you think that?

12:33.665 --> 12:35.798
I don't know. Rick likes
helping me out with cases.

12:35.842 --> 12:39.062
Uh, no, no,
Rick doesn't, in fact.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.195
Rick thinks that Thomas
is taking advantage

12:41.238 --> 12:42.631
of their friendship.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.589
All right, I hear you.

12:44.633 --> 12:45.808
TC, send me a bill.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.724
Check the mail, brah.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.552
I mean, geez, you come
into a little money,

12:50.595 --> 12:52.597
and suddenly everyone's
got their hand out.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.425
I liked it better
when I was broke.

12:54.469 --> 12:56.427
"Rick enjoys it."
Give me a break.

12:56.471 --> 12:57.602
Right?

12:57.646 --> 12:59.082
I'm out of here.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.910
HIGGINS:
So, it appears

13:00.954 --> 13:03.260
as if your client
Mr. Hayes' demise

13:03.304 --> 13:06.002
was indeed a tragic accident.
It wasn't a homicide.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.613
Yeah, maybe.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.528
You're still not convinced?

13:10.572 --> 13:13.705
Not really. There's still
one thing I want to check out.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.278
Hola. Not a good time, Magnum.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.758
She always says that.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.457
And I always mean it, except
this time, I really mean it

13:26.501 --> 13:28.198
because I have
a double homicide on deck.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.634
Look, this isn't
gonna take long.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.723
This is Dr. Noelani Cunha,

13:31.767 --> 13:33.160
the best medical
examiner on the island.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.726
And this is Juliet Higgins,

13:34.770 --> 13:37.033
majordomo of Robin's Nest.Pleasure.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.948
You're the one that has to deal
with this guy all the time?

13:38.992 --> 13:41.255
Sadly, yes.Ugh. That can't be easy.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.604
Are you really having this
conversation in front of me?

13:42.647 --> 13:44.911
It's dreadful.You poor thing.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.565
Okay, that's enough.
Look, I have a question.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.263
Uh, what can you tell me
about Larry Hayes?

13:49.306 --> 13:51.178
What do you want to know?How'd he die?

13:51.221 --> 13:53.397
Well, his car went off
an incline,

13:53.441 --> 13:55.791
so he suffered multiple
fractures, so chances are

13:55.835 --> 13:58.054
blunt force trauma had something
to do with it.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.230
Okay, well, that's obvious.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.666
Dig a little deeper, though.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.756
I-I'm thinking there may have
been foul play involved.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.715
See, right about now is
where Magnum tries

14:06.758 --> 14:08.760
to bribe me with food,
except this time

14:08.804 --> 14:10.501
I'm going
to preemptively decline.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.460
Okay.

14:12.503 --> 14:16.551
H-How about a-a donation
to Home for Hawaii?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.858
Whatever spare change you have
in your pocket won't be enough

14:18.901 --> 14:20.207
to get me to do this favor.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.818
How about a more sizable
donation? Say, uh...

14:22.862 --> 14:25.125
75 bucks. It's pretty generous.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.214
I was thinking more like
a thousand dollars.

14:27.257 --> 14:29.520
Magnum's actually pretty
flush at the moment.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.132
Magnum? That can't be true.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.830
No, I can assure you
he's, he's quite liquid.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.094
So, a thousand dollars?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.447
Anything for charity.

14:43.491 --> 14:44.535
Brilliant.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.842
Okay. I'll look into it.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.235
Keep your phone on.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.280
Juliet, it was great
meeting you.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.326
Girls' night sometime?I'd love to.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.371
Great.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.722
She's great.You know, at this rate,

14:57.766 --> 15:00.116
I'm not gonna have any
of Larry's money left over.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.423
Not my problem.
So what now?

15:02.466 --> 15:03.990
I'm gonna go check out
Larry's apartment.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.948
You are welcome to stay here
if you want.

15:05.992 --> 15:09.386
And miss the opportunity of
seeing you arrested for B and E.

15:09.430 --> 15:10.866
Not a chance.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.041
That's not gonna happen.

15:12.085 --> 15:14.391
[beeps]CAROLINE:
Can I help you?

15:14.435 --> 15:15.566
Yeah. Good afternoon, ma'am.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.960
I'm Lieutenant Thomas Magnum
with HPD.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.657
This is my associate
Juliet Higgins.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.443
I need to talk to you about one
of your tenants-- Larry Hayes.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.966
Come in.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
[buzzer sounds]

15:26.012 --> 15:28.666
See? No B and E.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.494
You do realize that
impersonating a police officer

15:30.538 --> 15:31.974
is a much more
serious crime?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.367
It's not a real badge.

15:33.410 --> 15:36.805
Yes. You have made that
moronic point before.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.503
You're ruining the moment.

15:41.244 --> 15:44.117
If you need anything else,
Lieutenant, just let me know.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.640
Thank you, Caroline.

15:45.683 --> 15:48.338
I'll be sure to tell the captain
how helpful you were. Hmm.

15:53.387 --> 15:58.087
Wow. Looks like Larry was pretty
serious about home security.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.089
Makes sense.

16:00.133 --> 16:02.004
He thought
someone wanted to kill him.

16:18.238 --> 16:20.240
Discover something, Detective?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.502
Lieutenant.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.156
And, yeah, uh...

16:23.199 --> 16:26.028
This receipt's dated
from yesterday.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.203
14 hours ago, to be exact.

16:27.247 --> 16:29.640
Must've been Larry's last meal.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.903
Yeah, not a bad choice either.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.296
Been to that place.
It's delicious.

16:33.340 --> 16:35.168
Oh.

16:35.211 --> 16:37.909
Roaches. How lovely.

16:37.953 --> 16:40.260
You do realize Robin's
Nest is gonna be crawling

16:40.303 --> 16:41.696
with these things if
you don't stop munching

16:41.739 --> 16:43.045
in the living room.
Just saying.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.873
Yeah, yeah.

16:44.916 --> 16:49.095
It looks like Larry was
staying up on his medication.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.835
Magnum, look.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.232
WOMAN:
Lieutenant Magnum, what do you
think you're going to do now?

16:56.276 --> 16:58.626
MAGNUM:
I... I don't know. I spent

16:58.669 --> 17:02.499
most of my adult life, uh,
trying to help people

17:02.543 --> 17:04.893
and trying to be of service.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.070
I guess it's-it's part
of who I am, part of...

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
who we all are.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.770
Uh, I think it'd be nice
to be able to find

17:12.814 --> 17:14.511
some way to keep doing that,

17:14.555 --> 17:18.994
to... help people in need

17:19.038 --> 17:22.998
who... maybe have nobody
to turn to.

17:25.696 --> 17:28.438
Well, it seems like
Larry was an admirer of yours.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.875
At least we know now
why he reached out to you.

17:30.919 --> 17:32.834
[phone ringing]

17:36.011 --> 17:38.057
Noelani, what
do you got?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.103
Hey, I found traces of aconitine
in Larry Hayes' system.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.192
Even a small amount can cause
shortness of breath,

17:43.236 --> 17:44.802
nausea, and then, finally,

17:44.846 --> 17:47.675
cardiac arrest, which is exactly
what happened to Mr. Hayes.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.852
He was dead before
his car went off the road.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.376
You were right.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.465
More like Larry was right.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.510
It was murder.

18:06.172 --> 18:07.999
KATRINA:
No, none of this
makes any sense.

18:08.043 --> 18:10.045
My brother was
a good person.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.916
He was kind, and he was sweet.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.702
That's why we're
trying to help.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.140
[sighs]

18:18.184 --> 18:21.535
You know...
I made a promise to my mother

18:21.578 --> 18:23.754
before she died
that I would look after Larry.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.149
I worked as hard as I could
just to support the both of us.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.759
I thought I was helping him,

18:28.803 --> 18:31.327
but maybe
if I had focused less on work

18:31.371 --> 18:33.329
and more on him,
I would have listened better.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.462
You know, I wouldn't have
dismissed his fears as symptoms.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.377
I-I... If I had
just believed him,

18:37.420 --> 18:39.118
I could have done something
to stop.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.294
HIGGINS:
Don't do this to yourself.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.166
Someone is responsible for this,
but it's not you.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.776
KATSUMOTO:
Excuse me.

18:45.820 --> 18:50.433
Katsumoto. Uh, Katrina, this is
Detective Gordon Katsumoto.

18:50.477 --> 18:52.000
I'm with HPD, ma'am.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.262
I'm very sorry
for your loss.

18:53.306 --> 18:54.655
Thank you.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.657
I need to ask you
some questions, but

18:56.700 --> 18:59.007
first I need a word
with Mr. Magnum and Ms. Higgins.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.837
You know,
just when I was starting

19:02.880 --> 19:04.839
to think, "Maybe Magnum's
not such a bad guy,"

19:04.882 --> 19:06.710
you go and keep me in the dark
about a homicide.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.408
Instead,
I have to find out from the M.E.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.844
We were gonna tell you.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.324
We just thought
Katrina should know first.Mm-hmm.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.890
Look, Detective,
I don't see any reason

19:12.934 --> 19:14.936
why we can't all work
together on this.Oh, you don't?

19:14.979 --> 19:16.155
How about, out
of the three of us,

19:16.198 --> 19:17.330
I'm the only one with a badge.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.505
Now, you two want
to investigate a homicide

19:18.548 --> 19:20.028
on this island? Great.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.464
Graduate from the Academy,
spend five years in uniform,

19:21.508 --> 19:23.292
pass the exam,
and get your shields.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.076
But until that day comes,
you need to back off.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.513
The only reason there's
a homicide to investigate

19:26.556 --> 19:28.167
is because of me.Is because of you.

19:28.210 --> 19:30.995
Yes. And the only reason you got
this far is by breaking the law.

19:33.259 --> 19:35.348
Now, you're lucky
we're not charging you. Now go.

19:39.308 --> 19:41.397
Look at it this way: you
proved your client was right,

19:41.441 --> 19:43.007
and now HPD are going
to investigate.

19:43.051 --> 19:46.489
And let's face it-- $10,000
for one day's work is not bad.

19:46.533 --> 19:49.231
Maybe you could take some
of that cash and use it

19:49.275 --> 19:51.364
to get a hotel room until
the house is fumigated.

19:51.407 --> 19:55.150
That way you can eat in
bed as much as you like.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.543
What?

19:56.586 --> 19:59.067
Uh, cockroaches.I'm sorry?

19:59.110 --> 20:01.765
So, there's three ways
Larry could have been poisoned--

20:01.809 --> 20:04.768
injection, skin contact,
or he could have ingested it.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.422
Okay. And?

20:06.466 --> 20:09.556
Well, Katrina said Larry was so
scared somebody was after him,

20:09.599 --> 20:11.471
he wouldn't leave his apartment
for over a week. Right?

20:11.514 --> 20:13.560
So, if somebody's stuck in their
home, how would you get to 'em?

20:13.603 --> 20:15.388
Poison the food
being delivered there.

20:15.431 --> 20:16.998
Exactly. And what do
cockroaches go after?

20:17.041 --> 20:19.261
Wh-What you said earlier
about the crumbs.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.132
What if those dead cockroaches

20:21.176 --> 20:23.526
in Larry's apartment ate
his leftover food

20:23.570 --> 20:24.484
and that's why they died?

20:24.527 --> 20:26.703
Certainly seems plausible.

20:26.747 --> 20:29.576
We need to find whoever
delivered Larry his last meal.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.534
Katsumoto told us to back off.

20:31.578 --> 20:33.623
I'll back off when my client
tells me to back off.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.367
RICK:
Hey.

20:38.411 --> 20:40.151
Oh, what are you
doing back here?

20:40.195 --> 20:43.024
Oh, Higgins asked me to come
check in on Dennis's crew

20:43.067 --> 20:45.026
while she's helping out Thomas
with something.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.680
Oh.Hey, how crazy is it

20:46.723 --> 20:48.856
you guys went
to high school together?

20:48.899 --> 20:50.031
I guess it's

20:50.074 --> 20:52.773
a pretty small island,
but...

20:52.816 --> 20:54.514
You okay?

20:54.557 --> 20:56.559
Dennis asked me out.

20:56.603 --> 20:57.734
Really?

20:57.778 --> 21:00.171
Wow, that's exciting.

21:00.215 --> 21:01.782
What?Nothing.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.610
It's just...

21:03.653 --> 21:05.612
I've been thinking
about it, and...

21:05.655 --> 21:07.831
I just don't think
I'm ready for that.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.790
Well, how long has it been?

21:09.833 --> 21:10.965
Since my husband died?

21:11.008 --> 21:12.706
Almost four years.

21:12.749 --> 21:15.143
Uh, now, Kumu,

21:15.186 --> 21:18.320
don't take this the wrong way,
but you're still pretty young.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.843
Why would I take that
the wrong way?

21:19.887 --> 21:21.236
No, let me finish. I...

21:21.280 --> 21:22.716
I'm saying
you're still pretty young.

21:22.759 --> 21:25.240
You got a lot of years left
on this earth.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.069
You really want to spend
all that time being alone?

21:28.112 --> 21:30.985
I mean, look, it's not like
the guy proposed or anything.

21:31.028 --> 21:31.768
He just asked you on a date.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.117
You should go, you know?

21:33.161 --> 21:34.336
Let your hair down.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.729
You deserve it.

21:39.820 --> 21:41.387
Thank you so much.
My associate and I

21:41.430 --> 21:42.692
really appreciate it.[beep]

21:42.736 --> 21:43.998
So, the delivery guy

21:44.041 --> 21:46.087
didn't recognize
the photo of Larry that I sent.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.654
He said he didn't give
the food to Larry,

21:47.697 --> 21:49.090
that he handed it to someone

21:49.133 --> 21:51.745
who was waiting
outside the building.

21:51.788 --> 21:54.661
So Larry's killer
intercepts the delivery,

21:54.704 --> 21:57.664
poisons it, and pretends to be
the delivery guy.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.013
We have to go and get
Larry's last meal

21:59.056 --> 22:00.101
so the lab can test it.

22:00.144 --> 22:02.451

Only got one pair of these,

22:05.324 --> 22:06.934
so make sure
you don't leave any prints.

22:06.977 --> 22:08.370
I was a covert
operative, Magnum.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.503
You don't need to teach me
how to be invisible.

22:10.546 --> 22:12.331
[grunts]Hey!

22:13.375 --> 22:14.637
Go that way. Cut him off.Yeah!

â™ª

23:25.534 --> 23:27.014
If that man
already killed Larry,

23:27.057 --> 23:29.059
why would he come back here?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.845
Higgins,

23:31.888 --> 23:33.890
there's a hole here,
behind where the fridge was.

23:38.678 --> 23:39.635
It's empty.

23:39.679 --> 23:41.028
Whatever was in here,

23:41.071 --> 23:42.856
he must have gotten it out
just before we arrived.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.858
So that's what
all this was about, then?

23:44.901 --> 23:47.121
Larry was murdered so
that the killer could get

23:47.164 --> 23:48.731
into his apartment
and break through the wall?

23:48.775 --> 23:50.603
Yeah, looks like it.

23:51.778 --> 23:54.171
But why now?

23:54.215 --> 23:56.217
MAGNUM:
Yeah, good afternoon, ma'am.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.046
I'm Lieutenant Thomas Magnum
with HPD.

23:59.089 --> 24:01.483
Demolition notice posted
at the front of the building.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.137
The building's
about to be torn down.

24:03.180 --> 24:04.965
That would explain the urgency
to get inside.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.053
[door opens]

24:06.096 --> 24:08.403
Stay right there.
Don't move.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.840
KATSUMOTO:
It's okay.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.102
You can put 'em down.

24:12.146 --> 24:13.843
I know these two.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.497
The hell you doing here?

24:15.541 --> 24:17.499
Larry's sister pays the rent
on this place.

24:17.543 --> 24:18.892
Okay? We had
permission.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.328
What's with the hole
in the wall?

24:20.371 --> 24:22.809
That was already here
when we got here.

24:25.289 --> 24:27.422
According to the M.E.,
Mr. Hayes ingested the poison

24:27.466 --> 24:28.902
before he got behind the wheel.

24:28.945 --> 24:30.425
That makes this
the primary crime scene.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.819
You need to leave so we can get
CSU in here to process.

24:32.862 --> 24:33.950
Okay.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.430
No problem.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.437
Katsumoto isn't gonna be pleased
when he finds out

24:42.481 --> 24:44.004
you're keeping him
in the dark again.

24:44.047 --> 24:45.919
It's the only way we're
gonna stay on the case.

24:45.962 --> 24:48.008
What's the next move?Got to find out

24:48.051 --> 24:50.010
who the tenants were
that lived there before Larry.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.099
Maybe they can tell us
what was hidden inside the wall.

25:02.022 --> 25:06.026
I don't think she appreciated
your little deception earlier.

25:06.069 --> 25:09.682
Larry was someone I cared about,
and you lied to me!

25:09.725 --> 25:11.205
And I'm sorry about that.

25:11.248 --> 25:13.860
Look, the truth is,
I'm a private detective.

25:13.903 --> 25:16.123
Larry hired me,
and I just...

25:16.166 --> 25:18.386
I need a list of people
who lived in his apartment

25:18.429 --> 25:19.735
before he did.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.958
Here.

25:25.001 --> 25:26.133
Scooch.

25:26.176 --> 25:28.788
Caroline,

25:28.831 --> 25:30.485
I don't know
what the police told you,

25:30.529 --> 25:32.400
but Larry didn't perish
in a car accident.

25:32.443 --> 25:33.706
He was murdered.

25:33.749 --> 25:36.273
Now, I know
that Magnum's ethics

25:36.317 --> 25:38.101
can sometimes be...

25:38.145 --> 25:39.363
questionable,

25:39.407 --> 25:41.148
but you should know

25:41.191 --> 25:42.715
that he never gives up
on a client

25:42.758 --> 25:44.717
and he will do
whatever he feels he must

25:44.760 --> 25:46.588
in order
to solve a case.

25:46.632 --> 25:48.285
Now, you don't have
to forgive him.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.550
But by helping him, you would be
getting justice for Larry.

25:57.817 --> 25:58.774
Okay.

25:58.818 --> 26:01.560
I'll get you
that list.

26:14.094 --> 26:15.878
May I help you?

26:15.922 --> 26:18.489
Kalea Upolu?

26:18.533 --> 26:20.404
It's Kalea Sterling now.

26:20.448 --> 26:22.972
Do I know you?

26:23.016 --> 26:25.496
It's, um, Teuila Tuileta,

26:25.540 --> 26:27.281
from Kukui High.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.022
[gasps]

26:29.065 --> 26:30.632
Right!

26:30.676 --> 26:32.286
Hi!

26:32.329 --> 26:35.463
Oh, wow,
it's been a long time.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.857
Wh-What are you doing here?

26:37.900 --> 26:39.032
Oh.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.121
Uh, I just stopped by

26:41.164 --> 26:43.079
because your husband,

26:43.123 --> 26:46.300
Dennis, is, uh,
fumigating where I work,

26:46.343 --> 26:50.478
and I, I just wanted to tell him
everything is going well.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.262
He was right.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.047
I had nothing to worry about.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.483
Good.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.616
I'll be sure to tell him.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.446
Are you okay?

27:02.490 --> 27:03.665
Yes, I'm fine.

27:03.709 --> 27:06.015
Uh, j-just give him the message.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.234
[chuckles]

27:07.277 --> 27:08.409
Nice seeing you again.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.150
You, too.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.978
By the way,

27:12.021 --> 27:13.936
you look great.

27:13.980 --> 27:16.417
Uh...

27:18.724 --> 27:20.377
[exhales]

27:20.421 --> 27:22.423
â™ª

27:32.607 --> 27:34.957
We should start
by looking into previous tenants

27:35.001 --> 27:36.263
with a criminal record.

27:37.438 --> 27:38.395
Done.

27:38.439 --> 27:40.136
There are two,

27:40.180 --> 27:41.703
one of whom is deceased,
the other of whom

27:41.747 --> 27:43.183
is currently in prison.

27:43.226 --> 27:44.663
Randy Hamaka.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.708
He was arrested two years ago
on an assault charge.

27:46.752 --> 27:48.623
I heard of this guy. He used
to run all the criminal activity

27:48.667 --> 27:49.668
on the Waianae Coast.

27:49.711 --> 27:50.973
But if he's still in prison,

27:51.017 --> 27:52.061
there's no way
he's the same man we ran into

27:52.105 --> 27:53.367
in Larry's apartment.No.

27:53.410 --> 27:54.760
But he could know
what was in the wall

27:54.803 --> 27:56.022
and who may be coming after it.

27:57.719 --> 27:58.807
[lock buzzes]

27:58.851 --> 28:01.680
[door opens and closes]

28:01.723 --> 28:03.464
Sorry, can't help you.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.074
Well, whatever was hidden
in that wall

28:05.118 --> 28:06.293
was worth killing over,

28:06.336 --> 28:08.861
which tells me
it was probably valuable.

28:08.904 --> 28:10.689
If you say so.

28:11.777 --> 28:12.865
When do you get out?

28:12.908 --> 28:14.083
Two months, right?

28:14.127 --> 28:15.955
Yeah. So?

28:15.998 --> 28:17.913
So tell me what was in the wall,

28:17.957 --> 28:19.872
and maybe I can help you
get it back.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.527
Look, Randy,
I'm not a cop.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.442
Okay? So I don't care
what was inside the wall.

28:25.486 --> 28:27.053
Stolen goods or whatever.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.055
I just want to find the guy
who has it.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.753
Well, you're gonna have
to do that without me.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.059
'Cause, like I said,

28:33.102 --> 28:35.322
I don't know
what you're talking about.

28:35.365 --> 28:37.498
And if I wanted
to hide something,

28:37.541 --> 28:39.282
I'm not sticking it
in no kitchen wall.

28:41.284 --> 28:43.112
Good talk.

28:46.159 --> 28:48.074
[scoffs]

28:51.207 --> 28:52.469
So, is he in on it?

28:52.513 --> 28:54.471
Up to his eyes.
But he's playing dumb.

28:54.515 --> 28:56.299
Well, actually,
he's not playing dumb.

28:56.343 --> 28:57.736
He's straight-up dumb,

28:57.779 --> 28:58.867
because I said
there was something hidden

28:58.911 --> 28:59.868
in one of the walls.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.348
I didn't tell him which room.

29:01.391 --> 29:02.871
And, somehow, he knew
I was talking about the kitchen.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.394
We have to find out

29:04.438 --> 29:06.048
who Randy's been in contact with
on the outside.

29:06.092 --> 29:08.050
He might have sent someone
to Larry's apartment.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.269
Yeah,
that's gonna mean accessing

29:09.312 --> 29:11.053
prisoner phone records
and visitor logs.

29:11.097 --> 29:12.707
You think you can manage that?

Child's play.

29:20.671 --> 29:22.456
Don't ask how, but
we found a suspect.

29:22.499 --> 29:25.415
Who?HIGGINS:
An ex-con named Jayson Colfax.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.417
He's an accomplished thief
who's recently been in contact

29:27.461 --> 29:28.984
with a prisoner at Halawa

29:29.028 --> 29:30.986
who used to live
in Larry's apartment.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.596
I'm sending you his photo now.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.294
MAGNUM:
We'd seen Colfax poking around

29:34.337 --> 29:36.426
Larry's apartment earlier.
Pinged his phone.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.733
He's in Honolulu Harbor
right now.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.430
I'm thinking he might be trying
to get off the island.

29:40.474 --> 29:41.431
Okay.

29:41.475 --> 29:43.085
We'll meet you there.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.434
But wait for us.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.871
Of course.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.046
[dial tone, beep]

Ow! Ow, you're hurting me.

31:12.914 --> 31:14.046
Would you prefer a bullet?

31:14.089 --> 31:15.699
My friend has 16 of them.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.484
Well done.

31:17.527 --> 31:19.181
Who are you guys?

31:19.225 --> 31:21.009
Larry Hayes hired me.

31:21.053 --> 31:22.881
You remember him, right?

31:22.924 --> 31:24.360
The man you poisoned to death.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.145
I didn't mean
for that to happen.

31:26.188 --> 31:27.407
I was just trying
to get him sick enough

31:27.450 --> 31:28.712
so he'd leave his apartment.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.192
Did Randy Hamaka send you there?

31:30.236 --> 31:31.890
Yeah.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.935
Why? What was in the wall?

31:33.979 --> 31:37.504
[tires screeching]

31:37.547 --> 31:38.853
I got him.
Go check it out.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.386
Katsumoto?

31:50.430 --> 31:51.953
No. Not Katsumoto.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.955
Three men. All armed.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.435
Your friends?

31:55.478 --> 31:57.089
No. Randy must've sent them.

31:57.132 --> 31:58.829
I got word to him about
everything that happened,

31:58.873 --> 32:00.092
and I told him where I was

32:00.135 --> 32:01.528
so he'd help me off the island.Well, it looks

32:01.571 --> 32:02.790
like he wants to silence you.

32:12.452 --> 32:14.454
â™ª

32:26.553 --> 32:28.120
We'll get you out of here,
but you have to work with us.

32:28.163 --> 32:29.860
Did you scope the ins and outs
of this place?

32:29.904 --> 32:31.253
Yeah. There's only one,
and they're coming through it.

32:31.297 --> 32:34.778
Then we'll have to cat
and mouse it out of here.

[helicopter blades whirring]

35:23.817 --> 35:25.297
What did Jayson say?

35:25.340 --> 35:28.430
Randy told him to break open
the wall behind the fridge

35:28.474 --> 35:29.953
and remove whatever was inside,

35:29.997 --> 35:32.391
but when he did,
he didn't find anything.

35:32.434 --> 35:34.480
Are you saying this guy Larry
was murdered

35:34.523 --> 35:35.872
for something
that wasn't even there?

35:35.916 --> 35:38.005
Looks that way.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.052
Unless Jayson was looking
in the wrong place.

35:43.402 --> 35:45.534
[indistinct police
radio chatter]

35:48.102 --> 35:50.322
Yeah. Some of the apartments
got remodeled a few years ago

35:50.365 --> 35:52.062
and things got moved around.

35:52.106 --> 35:53.542
This is where the
kitchen used to be,

35:53.586 --> 35:55.240
and that's where the fridge was.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.564
â™ª

36:32.973 --> 36:35.236
KATSUMOTO:
We ran ballistics on the gun
we found in your old place.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.021
Got a match

36:38.065 --> 36:39.980
to a pair of unsolved murders
from eight years ago.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.286
Both gang-related hits.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.984
But until now HPD
hadn't found a weapon

36:44.027 --> 36:45.681
or the person
who pulled the trigger.

36:45.725 --> 36:47.770
You knew they'd find the gun
in your old apartment

36:47.814 --> 36:49.032
when they tore it
down next month,

36:49.076 --> 36:51.165
so you had Jayson Colfax
go recover it.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.123
KATSUMOTO:
Problem is, the man who lived
in the apartment wouldn't leave.

36:53.167 --> 36:55.256
So Jayson had to get creative.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.693
Tried to poison the guy just
enough to get him to leave.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.783
Unfortunately for both of you,
he went too far.

37:00.827 --> 37:01.958
MAGNUM:
You were so close

37:02.002 --> 37:03.482
to getting out, Randy.

37:03.525 --> 37:05.440
Now you're not going anywhere.

37:05.484 --> 37:07.007
Enjoy your time in prison.

37:09.749 --> 37:11.751
On any other day,

37:11.794 --> 37:13.796
solving two murders
would feel good.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.843
Trouble is, for that to happen, one man had to die.

37:16.886 --> 37:21.717
All because some guy was dumb enough to hide a gun in a wall.

37:23.458 --> 37:25.721
I know it doesn't make it hurt
any less,

37:25.765 --> 37:28.289
but if it wasn't for Larry,
the families

37:28.333 --> 37:30.944
of those two victims
never would've got justice.

37:30.987 --> 37:33.642
[sniffs]

37:33.686 --> 37:35.165
We hope that will give you

37:35.209 --> 37:36.950
some small measure of solace.

37:37.994 --> 37:40.475
It does. Thank you.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.435
And thank you.

37:44.871 --> 37:48.918
Both of you,
for believing in Larry.

He's married?
Are you kidding me?

38:09.330 --> 38:10.679
Men are such dogs.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.377
Damn right.
You know what?

38:12.420 --> 38:13.813
When we're done here,
I'm gonna go over there

38:13.856 --> 38:15.293
and have a talk
with that guy.I'm going with you.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.295
Don't you dare, either of you.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.818
You're not at least
a little bit upset?

38:18.861 --> 38:20.950
Maybe a little.

38:20.994 --> 38:24.780
On the other hand...it felt good
to get all dolled up.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.304
And it made me realize

38:26.347 --> 38:28.349
that I need
to put myself out there.

38:28.393 --> 38:29.916
Maybe it's time.

38:29.959 --> 38:31.831
Can't we just key his car,
at least?

38:31.874 --> 38:34.790
Please don't. Then I'll have
to cite you for vandalism.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.357
Which reminds me,

38:36.401 --> 38:38.707
you'll be getting
a citation of your own

38:38.751 --> 38:40.318
in the mail in
the next day or so.

38:40.361 --> 38:41.754
For what?

38:41.797 --> 38:44.539
You can't go around
impersonating a cop, Lieutenant.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.368
Found out about that, huh?

38:47.412 --> 38:49.196
KATSUMOTO:
Oh, just be thankful you're
getting off with only a fine.

38:49.239 --> 38:52.460
I'll also be needing
that phony badge of yours.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.810
SHAMMY:
At least you still have
all that money from your case.

38:54.854 --> 38:57.900
Uh, that's not entirely true.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.380
How come?

38:59.424 --> 39:00.860
'Cause you sure as hell
didn't give any to me.

39:00.903 --> 39:02.818
Or me.

39:02.862 --> 39:04.603
I felt bad for taking
all that money.

39:04.646 --> 39:07.040
I mean, my daily rate's
only 550 bucks,

39:07.083 --> 39:09.042
so I took what I needed,

39:09.085 --> 39:10.609
and donated the rest

39:10.652 --> 39:12.001
to Homes for Hawaii
in Larry's name.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.177
You mean after you put aside
the money

39:14.221 --> 39:16.266
that you promised
to reimburse us.

39:16.310 --> 39:18.399
Well...

39:18.443 --> 39:19.618
I think that's a no.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.447
It's not cool, Thomas.

39:22.490 --> 39:23.709
What you want me to do? You want
me to get the money back?

39:23.752 --> 39:24.971
'Cause I could get it back.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.886
Nah, 'cause then we would be
the bad guys.

39:26.929 --> 39:28.670
See, this is exactly
what we're talking about.

39:28.714 --> 39:30.629
You always taking advantage.

39:30.672 --> 39:32.021
Katsumoto, back me up here.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.371
Yeah, he's right, Magnum.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.676
I got to say,
it's getting a little old.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.939
Okay.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.985
I'm not gonna ask anybody
for any more favors.

39:39.028 --> 39:42.031
[chuckles] How long do
you think that will last?

39:43.076 --> 39:45.557
They do have a
good point, Magnum.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.907
You have a terrible habit
of exploiting your friends.

39:47.950 --> 39:51.127
Although, to be fair,
you do also possess

39:51.171 --> 39:53.739
some admirable qualities.

39:53.782 --> 39:56.089
I'm listening.

39:56.132 --> 39:58.961
Case in point: I was
skeptical at first,

39:59.005 --> 40:01.877
but you always had
faith in your client.

40:01.921 --> 40:04.445
And were it not for your
pig-headed persistence

40:04.489 --> 40:07.405
and sense of mission,

40:07.448 --> 40:08.623
this case would never
have been solved,

40:08.667 --> 40:10.320
so you deserve
a little credit.

40:10.364 --> 40:13.454
Well, thank you, Juliet.

40:13.498 --> 40:15.456
You're welcome.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.371
Oh, and I wasn't gonna
pile it on just then,

40:17.415 --> 40:19.329
but I do still
expect you to repay me

40:19.373 --> 40:21.070
for the repairs
on the Ferrari.

40:21.114 --> 40:24.596
I was really hoping
you'd forgot about that.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.598
Sorry. No such luck.
