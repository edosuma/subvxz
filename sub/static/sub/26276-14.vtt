[Zeus and Apollo whine]

00:21.021 --> 00:22.283
You do realize
that eating in bed

00:22.326 --> 00:23.240
leads to insomnia.[vacuum cleaner whirring]

00:23.284 --> 00:25.329
I sleep just fine.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.591
And it attracts insects.

00:26.635 --> 00:28.028
I'm not afraid of ants
and roaches.

Do we really have
to do this now?

00:42.651 --> 00:44.653
Well, roaches and ants may
not bother you, Magnum,

00:44.696 --> 00:45.958
but they bother me.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.699
It's bad enough that
you're sleeping out here.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.572
It's not my fault the guesthouse
is full of termite damage.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.400
This house has eight bedrooms,

00:52.443 --> 00:55.359
and yet you choose to sleep
on a sofa in the common area.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.969
It's really comfy out here.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.536
I give up.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.235
There is just no point trying
to reason with a toddler.

01:01.278 --> 01:02.801
Oh, and a package

01:02.845 --> 01:05.543
came for you this morning.
It's in the study.

01:05.587 --> 01:08.155
And for the love of God,
put some trousers on.

MAGNUM:
Usually, when a lawyer wants
to reach you,

01:16.859 --> 01:17.773
it's bad news.

01:17.816 --> 01:18.991
But if he's reaching out

01:19.035 --> 01:20.471
on behalf
of a potential client,

01:20.515 --> 01:22.299
that could mean a job.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.696
[footsteps approaching]

01:29.393 --> 01:31.352
That's a lot of cash.

01:31.395 --> 01:33.223
It's $10,000.

01:33.267 --> 01:34.659
Why on earth
would anyone send so much?

01:34.703 --> 01:35.878
I don't know,
but this came with it.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.140
You mind if I use the laptop?Sure.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.272
That'll be $50.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.753
[chuckles] Are you
seriously gonna charge me?

01:41.797 --> 01:44.887
You promised to purchase
your own laptop months ago,

01:44.930 --> 01:46.454
and it still hasn't
happened. As such,

01:46.497 --> 01:48.804
now every time
you want to use my laptop,

01:48.847 --> 01:50.240
the charge is $50.

01:50.284 --> 01:51.589
That's a little extreme.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.461
That is my price.
Either you can get your own,

01:53.504 --> 01:54.810
or you can, as you Yanks

01:54.853 --> 01:57.291

saying, make it rain.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.335
You have any change?

01:58.379 --> 02:00.207
I'll just keep it. Thank you.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.774
No doubt you'll need to borrow
my laptop again in the future.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.168
By the way, you still owe me
for the repairs on the Ferrari.

much more serious than that.

watching this now...

come through you?

DENNIS:
You don't have to worry.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.983
There's no residue,
and as long as we aerate

04:05.027 --> 04:07.899
and do a clearance test,
this process is perfectly safe.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.598
But to be careful,

04:10.641 --> 04:13.165
these gentlemen
will carefully remove

04:13.209 --> 04:16.038

and put them in the garage.

just, uh, tell him
it's for the bajillion favors

But it's clear now
that it's much more serious

05:08.090 --> 05:09.700
than that.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.267
Any answers?

05:11.311 --> 05:14.705
Yeah, I just spoke
to the law firm that sent this.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.491
They handled Larry's mother's
affairs after her death.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.188
They hadn't heard from Larry
until last week

05:19.231 --> 05:20.972
when he asked them
to send me this envelope

05:21.016 --> 05:22.278
in the event of his death,

05:22.322 --> 05:24.236
which apparently happened
12 hours ago.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.977
It was a car accident.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.501
Well, that's a little curious.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.937
That's more
than a little curious.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.852
I mean, this guy's convinced
somebody's after him,

05:30.895 --> 05:32.244
and then he ends up dead.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.334
I mean, there's got to be
a connection there.

05:34.377 --> 05:38.207
One thing I don't understand
is why Mr. Hayes hired you

05:38.250 --> 05:40.340
to investigate his
murder specifically.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.733
'Cause I'm good.Debatable.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.082
[chuckles softly]

05:44.126 --> 05:45.345
I'm leaving.

05:45.388 --> 05:46.607
Seriously. I mean,
I can understand

05:46.650 --> 05:47.956
someone wanting to
engage your services

05:47.999 --> 05:49.871
if the only compensation
they could offer was...

05:49.914 --> 05:51.960
I don't know, live poultry.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.527
But it appears money
was no object.

05:53.570 --> 05:56.312
Surely Mr. Hayes could have
hired someone more reputable.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.358
But he chose you. Why?

05:58.401 --> 05:59.663
I don't know.

05:59.707 --> 06:03.058
But he did, so I'm obliged
to look into this.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.582
Magnum, you-you know
that twice as many people

06:05.626 --> 06:07.410
die in car accidents
as homicides.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.369
I'm not saying
I'm not intrigued by all this,

06:09.412 --> 06:11.283
but have you considered
the possibility

06:11.327 --> 06:12.720
that it is just a coincidence?

06:12.763 --> 06:16.593
Like any good detective,
I don't believe in coincidences.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.426
I still don't really know
why I'm here.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.167
My assistant said that you had

06:25.210 --> 06:27.996
information about my brother?Yes.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.911
I know this may sound strange,
Katrina,

06:29.954 --> 06:32.348
but your brother hired me
to solve his murder.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.611
I'm sorry.

06:36.352 --> 06:40.095
Uh, this morning I received
a video he made for me.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.227
He thought somebody
was out to kill him.

06:44.273 --> 06:47.015
Are you saying that what
happened wasn't an accident?

06:47.058 --> 06:48.320
Well, we're not
saying that,

06:48.364 --> 06:51.411
but the timing of it
is suspicious.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.371
I can't believe this. I...

06:59.288 --> 07:02.378
Last week Larry said

07:02.422 --> 07:04.815
that he thought someone
was watching him.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.296
He wouldn't leave his apartment.

07:07.339 --> 07:08.645
The only reason
he left yesterday--

07:08.689 --> 07:11.605
because he felt sick
and he needed to see the doctor.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.347
I thought he was being paranoid.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.741
That he was having
delusions again.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.308
What do you mean?

07:19.351 --> 07:23.443
Larry was... schizophrenic.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.314
If he was off his meds,

07:25.357 --> 07:27.621
he would sometimes see things,

07:27.664 --> 07:29.274
hear things.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.234
You don't think that this time
it could've been for real?

07:32.277 --> 07:34.018
Well, we won't
know for sure

07:34.062 --> 07:36.020
until we look into this.You have to.

07:36.064 --> 07:37.674
Please.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.111
What if he was right all along
and I just didn't believe him?

07:40.155 --> 07:41.330
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

07:43.593 --> 07:47.379
At this point, it's very likely
that it was just a car accident.

07:47.423 --> 07:49.251
And if it wasn't?

07:49.294 --> 07:51.383
Well, if it wasn't, then
we'll do what Larry hired us

07:51.427 --> 07:52.907
to do in the first place.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.256
We'll solve his murder.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.440
MAGNUM:
Okay, according
to the police report,

08:04.484 --> 08:05.485
Larry lost control here

08:05.528 --> 08:07.835
and then slid off
into the ravine.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.534
Does that furrowed brow

08:11.578 --> 08:14.972
constitute a conflicting thought
or the need for a potty break?

08:16.583 --> 08:17.497
I'm thinking maybe someone

08:17.540 --> 08:19.586
forced him off the road.

08:19.629 --> 08:21.631
Perhaps.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.634
But it's a single lane
going in one direction,

08:24.678 --> 08:26.331
so that would've
been difficult.

08:26.375 --> 08:28.333
And plus, there's only
one set of skid marks.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.858
All signs point
to it being an accident.

08:31.902 --> 08:34.122
Not if somebody tampered
with the car.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.341
And how do you intend
to find that out?

08:36.385 --> 08:38.343
The police must have impounded
the car by now.

08:39.997 --> 08:42.086
Really appreciate this, Mikey.

08:42.130 --> 08:43.958
Car's in the back.

08:44.001 --> 08:46.656
Only got an hour.
Does that buy you enough time?

08:46.700 --> 08:49.833
Please. This'll take
30 minutes, tops.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.705
Don't hold your breath

08:51.748 --> 08:54.098
on Magnum reimbursing you
for that hundred, by the way.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.360
What are you talking about?

08:55.404 --> 08:56.623
He promised
he was gonna pay me back.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.538
[laughs]:
When will you learn, man?

08:58.581 --> 09:01.584
Thomas never has more
than 40 bucks to his name.

Welcome to the

09:08.504 --> 09:11.072
Working for me,

09:11.115 --> 09:12.334
Yeah, lucky me.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.683
I'm not worried about the money

09:13.727 --> 09:16.556
'cause I know this client
paid him ten stacks

09:16.599 --> 09:18.819
just to take the case, so he's
got no excuse not to pay up.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.211
Hold up. $10,000?

09:20.255 --> 09:21.256
[whistles]Mm-hmm.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.779
Thomas ain't mention that.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.259
RICK: Yeah, probably 'cause
he knows you're gonna want him

09:24.302 --> 09:26.130
to reimburse you
for all the fuel costs

09:26.174 --> 09:28.263
that have been stacking up,
helping him out with his cases.

09:28.306 --> 09:30.134
That's what I'm thinking.

You up, doctor.

at being prom king that year.

you didn't.Wait a minute now.

Actually, we're divorced now.

09:57.292 --> 10:00.251
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

Still can't bring myself

10:04.212 --> 10:06.388
to take this thing off.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.611
Hey, do you remember
those parties I used to throw

10:11.654 --> 10:13.395
when my parents were
on the mainland?

10:13.438 --> 10:15.658
How could I forget?

10:15.702 --> 10:18.226
Well, I have moved
back into that house

10:18.269 --> 10:19.749
since they passed away,

10:19.793 --> 10:24.275

I think about those days.

10:24.319 --> 10:25.842
Yeah.

10:25.886 --> 10:29.193
I had the biggest crush on you.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.152
[laughing]:
Oh, stop.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.632
You loved all the ladies.

10:32.675 --> 10:35.504
I'm embarrassed
by the way I used to be.

10:35.547 --> 10:39.029
Well, you certainly
have changed a lot.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.989

you think you might want to--

10:50.693 --> 10:53.827
uh, I don't know--
get together sometime?

10:55.872 --> 10:59.223
Oh, no, I couldn't.

11:00.877 --> 11:04.925
It-It's just, uh...

11:04.968 --> 11:07.536
my husband was the
love of my life.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.670
I... I haven't even thought
about dating anyone

11:10.713 --> 11:12.497

11:12.541 --> 11:15.152
I understand.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.372
Tell you what.

11:17.415 --> 11:20.854
It's a... open invitation.

11:20.897 --> 11:24.335
I would really just love
to reconnect.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.163
I mean that.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.297
I'll think about it.

11:31.255 --> 11:33.170
Well, I'd better get going.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.172
Um, thanks for the coffee.Okay.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.174
Listen, you can
hang onto this.
Oh.

Uh, no, no,
Rick doesn't, in fact.

So, it appears

13:00.954 --> 13:03.260
as if your client
Mr. Hayes' demise

13:03.304 --> 13:06.002
was indeed a tragic accident.
It wasn't a homicide.

Yeah, maybe.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.528
You're still not convinced?

Not really. There's still

13:19.102 --> 13:21.278
Hola. Not a good time, Magnum.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.758
She always says that.

And I always mean it, except
this time, I really mean it

13:26.501 --> 13:28.198
because I have
a double homicide on deck.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.634
Look, this isn't
gonna take long.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.723
This is Dr. Noelani Cunha,

13:31.767 --> 13:33.160
the best medical
examiner on the island.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.726

13:34.770 --> 13:37.033
majordomo of Robin's Nest.Pleasure.

Okay, that's enough.
Look, I have a question.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.263
Uh, what can you tell me
about Larry Hayes?

13:49.306 --> 13:51.178
What do you want to know?How'd he die?

13:51.221 --> 13:53.397
Well, his car went off
an incline,

13:53.441 --> 13:55.791
so he suffered multiple
fractures, so chances are

13:55.835 --> 13:58.054
blunt force trauma had something
to do with it.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.230
Okay, well, that's obvious.

14:00.274 --> 14:01.666
Dig a little deeper, though.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.756
I-I'm thinking there may have
been foul play involved.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.715
See, right about now is
where Magnum tries

14:06.758 --> 14:08.760
to bribe me with food,
except this time

I'm going
to preemptively decline.

H-How about a-a donation
to Home for Hawaii?

14:16.594 --> 14:18.858
Whatever spare change you have
in your pocket won't be enough

14:18.901 --> 14:20.207
to get me to do this favor.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.818
How about a more sizable
donation? Say, uh...

14:22.862 --> 14:25.125
75 bucks. It's pretty generous.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.214
I was thinking more like
a thousand dollars.

flush at the moment.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.132

No, I can assure you
he's, he's quite liquid.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.447
Anything for charity.

You do realize that
impersonating a police officer

15:30.538 --> 15:31.974
is a much more
serious crime?

15:32.018 --> 15:33.367
It's not a real badge.

I'll be sure to tell the captain
how helpful you were. Hmm.

15:53.387 --> 15:58.087
Wow. Looks like Larry was pretty
serious about home security.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.089

Yeah, not a bad choice either.

and trying to be of service.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.070

of who I am, part of...

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
who we all are.

to be able to find

to turn to.

Larry was an admirer of yours.

why he reached out to you.

Noelani, what
do you got?

Hey, I found traces of aconitine
in Larry Hayes' system.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.192
Even a small amount can cause
shortness of breath,

17:43.236 --> 17:44.802
nausea, and then, finally,

17:44.846 --> 17:47.675
cardiac arrest, which is exactly
what happened to Mr. Hayes.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.852
He was dead before
his car went off the road.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.376
You were right.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.465
More like Larry was right.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.510
It was murder.

No, none of this
makes any sense.

before she died
that I would look after Larry.

18:23.798 --> 18:27.149
I worked as hard as I could
just to support the both of us.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.759
I thought I was helping him,

18:28.803 --> 18:31.327
but maybe
if I had focused less on work

18:31.371 --> 18:33.329
and more on him,
I would have listened better.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.462
You know, I wouldn't have
dismissed his fears as symptoms.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.377
I-I... If I had
just believed him,

18:37.420 --> 18:39.118
I could have done something
to stop.

with Mr. Magnum and Ms. Higgins.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.837
You know,
just when I was starting

19:02.880 --> 19:04.839
to think, "Maybe Magnum's
not such a bad guy,"

19:04.882 --> 19:06.710
you go and keep me in the dark
about a homicide.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.408
Instead,
I have to find out from the M.E.

19:08.451 --> 19:09.844
We were gonna tell you.

19:09.887 --> 19:11.324
We just thought
Katrina should know first.Mm-hmm.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.890
Look, Detective,
I don't see any reason

19:12.934 --> 19:14.936
why we can't all work
together on this.Oh, you don't?

19:14.979 --> 19:16.155
How about, out
of the three of us,

19:16.198 --> 19:17.330
I'm the only one with a badge.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.505
Now, you two want
to investigate a homicide

19:18.548 --> 19:20.028
on this island? Great.

Graduate from the Academy,

and get your shields.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.076
But until that day comes,
