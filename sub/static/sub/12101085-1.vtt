Babe.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.944
Oh my God, I just had this crazy
dream.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.446
But it was like the
craziest thing in the world.

03:33.715 --> 03:35.348
Like I almost killed this lady

03:35.382 --> 03:38.452
but it's like I was the
lady at the same time,

03:38.485 --> 03:40.955
like I almost killed myself.

03:40.988 --> 03:45.459
But I was also the bum in
the street asking for money.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.697
Oh my God-

03:49.731 --> 03:51.566
- What do you think of this
watch?

03:51.599 --> 03:52.734
I was thinking about it

03:52.767 --> 03:56.436
and I feel like if I had a
real man's watch on my wrist

03:56.470 --> 03:57.370
when I walk into these meetings,

03:57.404 --> 03:58.940
I'd probably get a
little bit more respect.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.474
Are you serious right now?

04:01.308 --> 04:03.477
I'm trying to tell you
about this dream I had,

04:03.511 --> 04:05.046
like it means something.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.347
Babe, it's a bad dream.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.783
It's not even real.

04:08.816 --> 04:09.917
None of that stuff actually
happened.

04:09.951 --> 04:12.486
You're sitting here talking
about a watch right now.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.689
You don't like it?

04:14.722 --> 04:17.058
It'll look good on you, babe.

04:17.091 --> 04:17.925
You think so?

04:17.959 --> 04:19.694
Yeah, it'll look great.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.561
Can we get it?

04:20.595 --> 04:23.396
Can we go shopping today finally
please?

04:24.165 --> 04:26.634
Okay, yeah, but listen don't
do this,

04:26.667 --> 04:29.036
like you know I have to go to
the studio.

04:29.070 --> 04:30.605
Are you fucking serious?

04:31.338 --> 04:33.373
- I have to finish this album
- Today?

04:33.406 --> 04:34.709
Today?

04:34.742 --> 04:35.910
You promised.

04:35.943 --> 04:36.844
Last week, I said,

04:36.878 --> 04:38.311
can we please spend some time
together?

04:38.345 --> 04:39.412
You said, tomorrow.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.114
The next day I asked you,

04:40.148 --> 04:41.048
are we gonna go to lunch today?

04:41.082 --> 04:43.084
You said, tomorrow, we'll go to
the mall.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.719
Then, I ask you can we go to the
mall?

04:44.752 --> 04:45.586
It's next week.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.687
I just woke up.

04:46.721 --> 04:47.955
I'm tripping because I
want to spend time with you?

04:47.989 --> 04:49.023
Yeah, you woke up,

04:49.056 --> 04:50.423
I've been sitting here
waiting for you to wake up

04:50.457 --> 04:51.626
so we could get our day started

04:51.659 --> 04:53.594
and the first thing you say

04:53.628 --> 04:54.461
is all this stuff

04:54.494 --> 04:55.696
about this crazy stupid dream
you had.

04:55.730 --> 04:56.597
You didn't even say good
morning.

04:56.631 --> 04:57.899
Are you serious right now?

04:57.932 --> 05:00.535
- Every morning-
- Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

05:00.568 --> 05:04.038
I have been trying to spend
time with you for weeks.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.139
It's like I'm not even a
priority,

05:05.173 --> 05:07.575
like I'm not even a thought
in your fucking mind.

05:07.608 --> 05:08.943
Yeah, obviously because it seems
like

05:08.976 --> 05:09.744
the studio is more sexier than
me,

05:09.777 --> 05:12.547
the studio is way more
important.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.446
Stacy, seriously?

05:13.480 --> 05:14.982
Yeah, I'm very serious.

05:15.016 --> 05:15.883
You know what?

05:17.585 --> 05:18.418
I'm over it.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.787
I'm just gonna go to the mall by
myself.

05:19.821 --> 05:20.888
You do this rant

05:20.922 --> 05:22.857
and I can't even focus
when I get into the studio.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.059
Yeah, focus on me for
once.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.727
How 'bout that?

05:26.761 --> 05:28.596
- Yo, let's just-
- You're always in the studio.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.631
- Yo, calm down.
- You live there.

05:30.665 --> 05:31.866
Get the fuck out of here.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.467
Go ahead, make your stupid
album.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.469
Just give me your card and
I'm gonna go by myself.

05:36.504 --> 05:37.171
Are you serious?

05:37.205 --> 05:37.872
Yeah, it's better that way.

05:37.905 --> 05:38.573
You're not gonna slow me down,

05:38.606 --> 05:39.372
I'm not gonna be a distraction.

05:39.406 --> 05:40.908
You can fucking go to the
studio,

05:40.942 --> 05:42.009
record your album,

05:42.043 --> 05:43.443
everything will be great.

05:46.981 --> 05:48.448
It's on the counter.

05:49.150 --> 05:50.017

Ling, your back in my office
again,

11:58.185 --> 11:59.253
I hate to tell you this.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.855
But you cannot continue MBA,

12:01.889 --> 12:04.391
and your dance classes at the
same time.

12:05.226 --> 12:07.962
It's too much conflict for next
semester.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.097
You can handle all of that load.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.467
I can handle my course
load. I know my own limit sir.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.504
So you're telling me you can
be at two places all at once?

12:17.204 --> 12:20.542
My mistakes, I didn't
realize you could transcend

12:20.575 --> 12:23.410
the barriers of time is space.

12:23.444 --> 12:27.481
By all means, take both of
your courses in the same hour.

12:27.515 --> 12:29.950
board meetings.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.963
What are you doing?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.897
You must pay attention
in all of your classes

12:51.939 --> 12:52.731
this school year.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.983
We'll let you continue your dance classes,

12:55.025 --> 12:57.361
only if you graduate with first honors!

12:57.402 --> 13:00.113
Ling Fei! Everything you're
doing right now will prepare you

13:00.155 --> 13:02.658
to take over the family business.

13:02.699 --> 13:03.951
Do you understand?

13:03.992 --> 13:06.370
OK mommy, I will do whatever you say.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.705
I'll study hard, and make you proud.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.125
Make us proud?

13:13.669 --> 13:16.839
What are you doing?
You're only playing around!

13:16.880 --> 13:19.174
We're the ones paying for everything!

13:19.216 --> 13:21.885
We want you to do well
in academics as well

13:21.927 --> 13:24.388
as our family business.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.390
Understand!?

13:27.891 --> 13:28.976
Don't get mad.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.354
I understand, DAD. Can I go now?!

13:32.396 --> 13:34.314
See!? She just wants to leave.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.450
Can you stop with the rubbish.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.944
I'm sick of you three, just stop
arguing.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.698
Come on, enough! I got it.

13:43.407 --> 13:45.784
Don't walk away. Listen to us!

13:49.531 --> 13:54.536
Ling, Ling, are you day
dreaming?

13:55.603 --> 13:57.404
Don't day dream.

13:57.438 --> 13:59.340
You cannot day dream in my
office.

13:59.373 --> 14:02.242
Got to be focused, get
your life together, please.

14:02.276 --> 14:03.243
Calm down.

14:03.277 --> 14:05.580
Stop it, look and stop
everything you're doing.

14:05.613 --> 14:08.949
Do you know who I am? Do
you know who my father is?

14:08.982 --> 14:12.086
You are not Beyonce. You're
not Ciara.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.153
You're not with Nicki Minaj,

14:13.187 --> 14:16.023
or even a white girl that
said catch me outside.

14:17.525 --> 14:19.159
Get out of my office right now.

14:19.193 --> 14:20.160
Okay, okay.

14:20.194 --> 14:23.531
Don't tell your father
I scream at you, please.

14:23.565 --> 14:25.600
He takes very good care
of me, but then shut up,

14:25.633 --> 14:27.368
and get your life together, go!

14:27.401 --> 14:29.103
Okay, okay, whatever.

14:29.136 --> 14:34.108
Just go.

Man, now this, you guys
have good taste in music.

21:09.637 --> 21:10.437
You already know what I do.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.973
But when is your album coming
out?

21:12.006 --> 21:12.974
Come on man.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.742
It's his girl that's
causing them problems.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.577
His girlfriend is not
giving him all the time,

21:16.611 --> 21:19.046
but the album, you know the
touchy subject.

21:19.080 --> 21:21.549
That's what's going on,
you can't land focus.

21:21.582 --> 21:22.650
His mind is like rattles.

21:22.683 --> 21:26.353
Yo Stacy man, she just
like, out of control like...

21:26.386 --> 21:27.354
What happened man, are
you good?

21:27.387 --> 21:28.823
Like I tried to take
her out the other day.

21:28.856 --> 21:29.991
We went to a real nice
restaurant.

21:30.024 --> 21:32.627
She went crazy like TMZ almost
showed up.

21:32.660 --> 21:33.326
Then get rid of the girl man.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.531
Look at you young guy you got...

21:36.564 --> 21:38.800
I'm in love her man, come
on, you know I love her.

21:38.833 --> 21:39.634
You know that.

21:39.667 --> 21:40.535
Yeah, well then get a side
chick.

21:43.938 --> 21:44.839
Are you saying talking about
the album?

21:44.872 --> 21:46.774
Yeah, like 20 bucks.

21:46.808 --> 21:48.375
You just said it was $6?

21:48.408 --> 21:49.442
It went up.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.310
Why?

21:50.343 --> 21:51.746
Because you guys are wasting
my time.

22:09.366 --> 22:11.123
What is this about?

22:12.291 --> 22:13.375
Pardon me.

22:13.417 --> 22:16.545
I invited you all over today,
because I needed to tell you

22:16.587 --> 22:21.091
something about Ling Fei
which really worries me a lot.

22:26.881 --> 22:28.783

22:28.816 --> 22:30.117

22:39.610 --> 22:40.944
Obviously,

22:40.986 --> 22:44.114
Ling Fei doesn't know
how serious this matter is.

22:44.156 --> 22:47.618
If our investors saw this...

22:47.659 --> 22:49.703
Ling Fei's still young.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.123
This video means nothing.

22:54.291 --> 22:56.376
I've known her since she was very little,

22:56.418 --> 22:58.587
I know her very well.

22:58.629 --> 23:01.632
She has what it takes
to run the family business well.

23:01.673 --> 23:03.133
And to become an excellent leader.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.430
Mr. Ling, please give Ling Fei some time.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.974
She will discover her strengths.

23:11.016 --> 23:14.811
Maybe, while I'm in America next week
I'll talk to her.

23:14.853 --> 23:17.189
I believe she has what it takes.

23:17.898 --> 23:22.152
KK, you don't have to worry.
We will handle it on our own.

23:23.403 --> 23:26.615
OK, let us handle this on our own.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.534
You can go now.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.119
All right.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.891
Mr. Ling?

23:55.185 --> 23:56.645
Cigar?

23:58.939 --> 24:00.399
It's time for dinner.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.125
I'm already rich!

24:23.881 --> 24:24.923
Mr. Ling?

24:25.757 --> 24:28.093
You say no to everything I say.
Should I just quit?

24:30.012 --> 24:31.346
Good suggestion!

24:33.432 --> 24:34.224
Remember what you said.

24:34.266 --> 24:35.934
- Get out.
- Then I'll go.

24:38.270 --> 24:40.439
Why would you fire Doit?

24:41.148 --> 24:44.359
I'm rich! I can hire anyone, anytime!

24:44.401 --> 24:45.986
Money can't solve everything.

24:46.028 --> 24:48.488
You should spend
more time with your family.

24:48.530 --> 24:50.032
I work for my family.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.784
I work this hard and
earn so much money just to raise her.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.077
She can have whatever she wants!

24:54.119 --> 24:57.372
Are you blind?
KK is trying to take over our company!

24:57.414 --> 24:59.875
Don't you know how to take
care of your daughter?

25:01.960 --> 25:02.794
Okay! I know,

25:02.836 --> 25:05.589
but I've sent someone
to secretly look after her.

25:06.757 --> 25:08.592
I'm too busy with my company.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.760
And why does she act so badly?

25:09.801 --> 25:11.303
Because you don't make
time for the family.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.722
You only care about the business.

25:13.764 --> 25:15.265
I can only do so much myself!

25:15.307 --> 25:17.809
You have the responsibility,
you are the father!

25:17.851 --> 25:21.146
From now on,
you will pay more attention to her!

25:21.188 --> 25:23.065
Call her tomorrow!

25:23.106 --> 25:25.108
Relax, relax!

25:25.150 --> 25:28.612
Okay! I will compromise,
my dear, I'll follow your advice.

25:28.654 --> 25:31.240
I'll talk to her tomorrow.

25:31.657 --> 25:33.659
Let's go to bed.

25:40.875 --> 25:43.077
You have not paid rent in two
months.

25:43.110 --> 25:44.278
What have you been doing with
that money?

25:45.279 --> 25:47.181
but I am on your side, listen,

25:47.214 --> 25:48.616
just because we have
the money doesn't mean

25:48.649 --> 25:49.683
that we should be paying for
every-

25:49.717 --> 25:52.153
- Guess who ain't going
nowhere though. This one.

25:57.792 --> 25:59.093
And where is PA anyway?

25:59.126 --> 26:00.327
I don't know, he's probably
upstairs.

26:00.361 --> 26:02.930
He could probably built the
studio in the closet goddamn,

26:02.963 --> 26:05.366
so he won't have to deal with
with my ass when he is home.

26:05.399 --> 26:07.168
He's so over my shit.

26:09.203 --> 26:10.971
Now who is this?

26:11.005 --> 26:15.176
Get the door, I
will be down in a second.

26:30.124 --> 26:31.125
How are you, you look
wonderful.

26:31.158 --> 26:32.226
Thank you so much.

26:33.894 --> 26:35.029
What's going on man?

26:35.062 --> 26:37.098
Zeek, what's going on man?

26:38.332 --> 26:39.500
Where you coming from?

26:39.534 --> 26:42.703
I'm coming from the studio
man. A few records of mine.

26:43.404 --> 26:44.338
What did you do?

26:44.371 --> 26:47.007
Just a few songs man,
some country vibes.

26:47.041 --> 26:48.409
You looking good man.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.211
How you guys doing, you
guys been doing all right?

26:50.244 --> 26:51.846
We are doing good, right?

26:51.879 --> 26:52.680
We are okay.

26:52.713 --> 26:53.747
Two love birds.

26:53.781 --> 26:55.416
Hell no they ain't doing
good, tell the truth.

26:55.449 --> 26:58.052
Shame the devil

26:59.753 --> 27:00.988
What are you talking about?

27:01.021 --> 27:03.224
What I'm I talking about, I'm
asking if you guys are good?

27:03.257 --> 27:08.162
We are fine, thanks for
asking, I'm glad someone cares.

27:08.195 --> 27:09.396
I don't believe her.

27:12.366 --> 27:14.168
what did I do, did I do
something?

27:14.201 --> 27:16.270
You didn't do anything, your
just fine.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.805
Let me talk to you right now.

27:17.838 --> 27:19.006
I'm so sorry.

27:21.942 --> 27:23.144
it is about time you want to
talk to me,

27:23.177 --> 27:24.011
lets talk.

27:24.044 --> 27:24.945
Lets talk, what?

27:27.281 --> 27:28.149
Kendall.

27:32.786 --> 27:34.688
Was it something I said man?

27:34.722 --> 27:35.689
Something you said?

27:35.723 --> 27:37.024
There was a lot that you said.

27:37.057 --> 27:39.793
I thought I was being
like respectful.

27:39.827 --> 27:42.830
You as shit,
what's going on between yall?

27:42.863 --> 27:46.333
Nothing man, we are

27:46.367 --> 27:48.269
Friends since when, I'm her
friend,

27:48.302 --> 27:49.470
she ain't got no other friend.

27:49.504 --> 27:50.471
I mean we are friends as well,

27:50.505 --> 27:53.774
maybe not in the same
capacity that you are

27:53.807 --> 27:54.909
What do you mean whatever?

27:54.942 --> 27:56.343
I mean hat the fuck ever.

27:56.377 --> 27:57.311
Don't you come back
here

27:57.344 --> 27:58.812
with all of that damn noise

28:03.284 --> 28:04.818
I'm really mad at you like-

28:05.819 --> 28:07.988
- Don't talk to him like that.

28:08.022 --> 28:09.456
You mad at me?

28:09.490 --> 28:11.158
Yeah you have nothing
to be mad at him over.

28:11.192 --> 28:12.760
If I disrespected you or
anything, I'm sorry man.

28:12.793 --> 28:14.094
I dint mean it, I just-

28:17.264 --> 28:19.166
I don't even know this girl
anymore.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.801
You don't know her?

28:20.834 --> 28:23.270
We know your money though, girl
let's go.

28:23.304 --> 28:24.405
You haven't known me,

28:24.438 --> 28:25.406
because you haven't spent time
with me,

28:25.439 --> 28:29.243
I'm not the same girl,
maybe if you were here

28:29.276 --> 28:31.979
every now and then you
would fucking know that.

28:46.827 --> 28:48.329
What's between you and Zeek?

28:48.362 --> 28:49.531
I don't know.

28:49.564 --> 28:53.033
Hello I'm over here, you
still looking at him walk away?

28:53.067 --> 28:53.934
He is beautiful.

28:57.071 --> 28:59.473
Come on, PA is never here.

29:04.044 --> 29:06.180
Ling, my girls looks super
good today.

29:19.493 --> 29:22.896
Ling, what are you doing the
bathroom?

29:22.930 --> 29:27.268
Ling seriously, you have
been in there way too long.

29:27.301 --> 29:30.070
Ling, come on, open the door.

29:31.506 --> 29:33.374

29:34.375 --> 29:39.514

understand my parents,

29:53.294 --> 29:54.962

I know you're busy making

32:23.711 --> 32:26.113
and I try not to trip, but it's
just like,

32:26.146 --> 32:29.082
I just want to spend time with
you.

32:30.752 --> 32:32.720
I just I just want
to spend time with you.

32:32.754 --> 32:34.054
Before you sign this deal,

32:34.087 --> 32:37.057
you is used to have these trips
together

32:37.792 --> 32:39.460
and are you really

32:39.493 --> 32:42.062
Yeah my man, how are you
doing,

32:42.095 --> 32:44.364
it's so good to hear your voice
again.

32:44.398 --> 32:45.265
What's up?

32:46.200 --> 32:47.167
Babe.

32:47.201 --> 32:49.704
You know what would
make you even happier?

32:49.737 --> 32:52.039
Is if I can hear your
fucking amazing voice

32:52.072 --> 32:55.209
through my million dollar
stereo system in my house.

32:55.242 --> 32:56.109
That's right.

32:57.110 --> 33:00.648
What the fuck,

33:00.682 --> 33:02.182
Seriously?

33:02.216 --> 33:03.116
Give me a second.

33:03.150 --> 33:04.084
We are at fucking dinner.

33:04.117 --> 33:05.018
Let me just we just

33:05.052 --> 33:06.220
We haven't even got our
appetizers yet,

33:06.253 --> 33:07.689

33:10.190 --> 33:12.527
What you say? A month?

33:12.560 --> 33:14.228
PA what the fuck?

33:14.261 --> 33:17.097
You should have been done
recording this yesterday.

33:17.130 --> 33:20.234
I mean do you even want
success motherfucker?

33:20.267 --> 33:22.035
I was laughing while I
was coming to have dinner

33:22.069 --> 33:22.770
with your fuck ass.

33:22.804 --> 33:23.671
It's business?

33:23.705 --> 33:24.873
This business,

33:24.906 --> 33:27.140
When the fuck you're gonna
make me your goddamn business.

33:27.174 --> 33:30.578
When the fuck, I'm I going
to be your first priority?

33:30.612 --> 33:31.713
I'm in New York.

33:34.114 --> 33:36.483
We are behind schedule
and we are losing money.

33:36.518 --> 33:39.253
Let them know who you are here
with,

33:39.286 --> 33:40.722
why didn't you say my name?

33:40.755 --> 33:43.190
Tell them who the fuck you're
here with.

33:43.223 --> 33:44.526
Can you give me one second
please.

33:44.559 --> 33:46.628
Is that you and Stacy
arguing in the background?

33:46.661 --> 33:49.396
This is exactly why
the fuck we are behind.

33:49.429 --> 33:51.566
Now get your ass over
here. Let's get busy.

33:52.867 --> 33:54.034
That's what I need.

33:54.802 --> 33:59.406
I need you to come right now.

34:00.340 --> 34:03.176
All right. I'm excited
to see my new artist.

34:03.210 --> 34:04.579
He is just here with stacy.

34:06.548 --> 34:07.749
Why you always do this?

34:07.782 --> 34:10.150
Because we're at diner, it's
our first diner in a month.

34:10.183 --> 34:12.252
You can't be serious
right now baby, chill out.

34:12.286 --> 34:14.388
Listen, we are at a nice dinner,
right?

34:14.421 --> 34:16.123
You want me to drink this?
Sure.

34:16.156 --> 34:16.824
Thank you.

34:21.295 --> 34:22.830
Fucking looser.

34:22.864 --> 34:24.532
Baby, come here.

34:24.566 --> 34:27.569
Your tripping, your breaking
stuff, Stacy!

34:27.602 --> 34:28.468
Come here

34:31.338 --> 34:32.540
Motherfucker.

35:03.504 --> 35:05.205
Changed the doors again.

35:19.787 --> 35:20.888
Hey.

35:23.490 --> 35:24.324
Yeah, is he here.

35:24.358 --> 35:25.627
Yes, hey babe.

35:27.361 --> 35:28.529
Hey babe.

35:30.531 --> 35:31.431
How are you doing? You look
good.

35:31.465 --> 35:33.568
Thank you, you look fantastic
yourself.

35:33.601 --> 35:35.135
Great to see you.

35:43.210 --> 35:45.245
Okay, so tell me how's the
album?

35:47.715 --> 35:48.683
It's doing pretty good.

35:48.716 --> 35:49.383
Really?

35:49.416 --> 35:50.952
Yeah, it's doing pretty good.

35:50.985 --> 35:51.819
Because you know, and I'm
really excited

35:51.853 --> 35:52.954
to be working with you on this
project.

35:52.987 --> 35:55.890
Yeah, well, thanks man,
I really appreciate that.

35:55.923 --> 35:57.091
I mean that, I consider you to
be one

35:57.125 --> 35:59.694
of the most talented guys I
worked with him a long time.

35:59.727 --> 36:00.561
Wow.

36:00.595 --> 36:01.763
And I work with many as you
know,

36:01.796 --> 36:04.297
but there's one thing about
you and I've been noticing,

36:04.331 --> 36:05.332
I could see it in your eyes.

36:05.365 --> 36:06.968
I hear when you singing,

36:07.001 --> 36:09.537
I feel like you're holding back
on me.

36:09.570 --> 36:11.338
Like you're being blocked
somehow.

36:12.774 --> 36:17.545
Well, I mean, I guess the
truth is that, you know,

36:17.578 --> 36:19.914
I could really use your help,
Alex.

36:19.947 --> 36:22.315
You got it PA, I'm here for
you now.

36:22.349 --> 36:23.183
Really?

36:23.216 --> 36:25.218
Yeah. I'm on your side. I mean
that.

36:25.252 --> 36:29.791
Okay. Yeah, what are you
saying?

36:29.824 --> 36:31.859
Yeah, I'm excited
about working with you.

36:31.893 --> 36:32.927
Yeah, me too man.

36:32.960 --> 36:33.795
Uh huh.

36:33.828 --> 36:35.395
Yeah. So it's just...

36:37.330 --> 36:40.535
PA what the fuck, the
second time the phone rang-

36:41.468 --> 36:42.937
No, really you're obviously
important.

36:42.970 --> 36:43.938
Take the fucking call.

36:43.971 --> 36:45.139
No, it's fine. It's fine.

36:45.173 --> 36:48.576
I need 100% of your attention
and no more distractions.

36:48.609 --> 36:50.511
Okay, let me just give me one
second.

36:50.545 --> 36:51.411
Unbelievable.

36:54.448 --> 36:55.215
Hello!

36:55.248 --> 36:58.351
You must be gay

36:58.385 --> 36:59.787
Relax, calm down.

37:02.056 --> 37:04.625
Yes. Listen, I am in a meeting.

37:04.659 --> 37:05.560
Oh my god.

37:06.994 --> 37:09.697
What is the point in

37:09.731 --> 37:10.598
Okay, yes.

37:11.899 --> 37:14.334
It's on. It's in the
jewelry box the armoire,

37:14.367 --> 37:15.435
in the in the bedroom.

37:34.421 --> 37:35.923
Alex

37:35.957 --> 37:37.692
What's up, man? What are you
saying?

37:37.725 --> 37:41.596
Wow, seriously PA, are
we done with this bullshit.

37:41.629 --> 37:43.664
I mean, we're already with the
album?

37:43.698 --> 37:46.701
We should have been done
recording this a long time ago.

37:46.734 --> 37:49.771
And you know what? these
distractions, this bullshit.

37:49.804 --> 37:53.373
It's costing me, in the studio
some serious fucking money.

37:53.406 --> 37:54.274
It's got to stop.

37:56.878 --> 37:58.546
Well, I mean, I'm working on
it.

37:58.579 --> 38:01.949
It's just Stacey man, she's
like...

38:07.855 --> 38:11.358
It's like, look, in the beginning
she was really supportive.

38:11.391 --> 38:12.727
That's why I fell in love with
her, Right?

38:12.760 --> 38:13.795
Right.

38:13.828 --> 38:14.595
And I'm just trying to
be honest with you, Alex.

38:14.629 --> 38:17.732
I mean, it's like, that's
what...

38:17.765 --> 38:19.534
The music was the reason
she fell in love with me,

38:19.567 --> 38:20.701
it's the reason I fell in love
with her.

38:20.735 --> 38:24.005
She was supporting me. And
now I feel like it's this...

38:24.038 --> 38:25.573
This is the reason why she hates
me.

38:25.606 --> 38:27.842
PA, stop being such a little
bitch.

38:27.875 --> 38:32.880
Success demands everything
you got 24/7, 365.

38:33.181 --> 38:36.383
Once you achieve it, it's
fucking amazing.

38:36.416 --> 38:38.653
It's powerful and it's
addictive.

38:38.686 --> 38:41.488
But you know what, not
everyone's meant for success.

38:41.522 --> 38:43.925
And I'm not convinced you are
right now.

38:43.958 --> 38:45.593
To attain it, you're gonna have
to shed

38:45.626 --> 38:47.528
all this fucking bullshit,
the distractions,

38:47.562 --> 38:49.096
the phone calls, everything.

38:49.130 --> 38:50.031
You need to be fucking you.

38:50.064 --> 38:51.132
Okay.

38:51.165 --> 38:53.366
You need to figure out
the path you want to get on,

38:53.400 --> 38:55.903
is going to be a path
of success, or failure?

38:59.106 --> 39:00.373
You know what, Alex?

39:01.474 --> 39:03.744
I think I needed to hear
that man. I appreciate that.

39:03.778 --> 39:05.680
I think I really needed to hear
that.

39:07.181 --> 39:08.115
You need to make this happen.

39:08.149 --> 39:10.084
I got you. I got you.
Listen, don't worry.

39:10.117 --> 39:11.719
I'm going to take care of the
album.

39:11.752 --> 39:12.587
It's going to be done in a week.

39:12.620 --> 39:15.455
I promise you. You got my word
on it.

39:15.488 --> 39:17.525
PA, don't let me down.

39:17.558 --> 39:20.027
I got you, don't worry, don't
worry, I'm good, it's good.

39:20.061 --> 39:21.028
All right.

39:21.062 --> 39:22.429
All right. Thank you,
man. I appreciate that.

39:22.462 --> 39:23.130
Your welcome.

39:29.637 --> 39:32.773
Ling, I'm obsessed with your
place.

39:34.441 --> 39:35.977
Look at this, everything is
perfect.

39:36.010 --> 39:40.081
Like you always are, I can't get
over you.

39:40.114 --> 39:42.650
I just don't stop working
until the work is done,

39:42.683 --> 39:43.751
that's what I'm taught to do.

39:43.784 --> 39:44.919
Don't you take a break
sometimes,

39:44.952 --> 39:47.722
I just finished in my place like
this.

39:47.755 --> 39:50.925
So, let's go out tonight.

39:50.958 --> 39:52.193
You want to?

39:52.226 --> 39:55.529
Girl, we bought some really
cute stuff last week remember,

39:55.563 --> 39:57.698
we are partying, and you're
getting drunk,

39:57.732 --> 39:59.432
and you're getting sexy, and
you are wearing the jeans.

39:59.466 --> 40:00.968
Remember we got this
the other day, and then-

40:01.002 --> 40:02.136
- Sorry it's my dad.

40:02.169 --> 40:03.638
No don't answer it.

40:03.671 --> 40:05.873
I'm sorry, I have to pick it
up.

40:05.907 --> 40:06.807
Just one second.

40:06.841 --> 40:08.817
No.he is going to ruin the
night again.

40:08.903 --> 40:10.160
Hey, Dad...

40:10.827 --> 40:12.120
Ling Fei?

40:12.162 --> 40:13.580
Where have you been?

40:13.622 --> 40:16.333
I've called you so many times,
and you're just now picking up my call?

40:16.375 --> 40:19.586
I know, I know. I have a friend over.

40:21.421 --> 40:23.507
Don't lie, and don't you talk
to me with such attitude.

40:23.549 --> 40:27.469
I am your father, and I have the right
and responsibility to know where you are!

40:29.263 --> 40:30.764
Listen!

40:31.473 --> 40:34.518
If you continue to do this,
you'll come back immediately!

40:34.935 --> 40:38.438
I know, I know.
I'm doing revisions with my friend.

40:40.732 --> 40:42.234
Do you respect your father?

40:42.276 --> 40:44.069
Yes, yes, Bye-Bye.

40:46.113 --> 40:47.148
Do you like this?

40:47.181 --> 40:49.550
Know what we're wearing
is nothing underneath now

40:50.251 --> 40:52.053
Alright, your going to wear
this with nothing underneath,

40:52.086 --> 40:53.821
and we're going out we're gonna
have fun,

40:53.854 --> 40:55.723
and we're gonna get you drunk.

40:55.756 --> 40:56.657
You are not answering that, come
on.

40:56.691 --> 40:59.894
Your not answering that sorry
not sorry.

41:04.590 --> 41:07.176
Mr. Ling, Don't be mad.

41:08.385 --> 41:11.972
You can see that Ling Fei is not
interested in handling business at all.

41:12.973 --> 41:14.141
I suggest...

41:15.934 --> 41:17.519
That you handover the company to me.

41:18.312 --> 41:19.771
I promise...

41:20.105 --> 41:23.442
I will follow your leadership
to handle the company.

41:26.069 --> 41:27.863
I know
exactly what's going on with Ling Fei.

41:28.447 --> 41:30.115
If she doesn't change...

41:30.908 --> 41:32.951
We will talk about it again.

41:33.202 --> 41:34.411
I want to be alone.

41:34.786 --> 41:35.621
Thank you.

41:35.662 --> 41:37.080
You may leave now.

41:56.141 --> 41:59.811
If you study hard,

41:59.853 --> 42:03.106
when you grow up
you'll get to do what you like,

42:03.148 --> 42:06.360
enjoy life and you'll be happy.

42:06.902 --> 42:10.030
When you're happy
you can do whatever you want!

42:10.072 --> 42:13.450
I'm working hard for our future.

42:14.326 --> 42:18.789
I will leave everything to you.
I promise you, okay?

42:18.830 --> 42:20.040
Okay.

42:25.921 --> 42:27.047
Okay?

42:27.089 --> 42:28.131
Okay!

42:28.173 --> 42:30.300
All right, give daddy a kiss.

42:38.225 --> 42:39.518
Take a good look
at this massive rice paddy.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.144
Once I get a chance,
I'll buy it all one day

42:41.186 --> 42:43.021
and I'll hand it over to you.

42:43.063 --> 42:45.023
- Does that sound good to you?
- Yeah.

42:45.065 --> 42:46.733
- Does it really?
- Yes!

42:46.775 --> 42:50.320
But you'll have to study really hard!

42:50.362 --> 42:51.989
Got it?

42:52.030 --> 42:53.699
- Yes, I get it.
- Look at me and say it.

42:53.740 --> 42:55.576
Yes, I really understand.

42:55.617 --> 42:58.036
I just want to make sure
you understand it.

43:10.091 --> 43:11.892
Yes, Mr. Ling.

43:11.925 --> 43:13.552
Keep a close eye on Ling Fei.

43:14.428 --> 43:16.847
I have a feeling
something bad is going to happen.

43:16.889 --> 43:19.099
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.961
No matter what. I must have the company.

44:29.002 --> 44:32.089
Boss, I got it. Everything is ready.

44:32.965 --> 44:35.676
I don't care if we hurt the girl.

44:36.093 --> 44:38.136
Will take action tomorrow night.

44:42.950 --> 44:46.287
Go get that bitch, I don't
want to see her face anymore.

44:46.320 --> 44:47.721
Get rid of her.

45:08.500 --> 45:09.543
Hello?

45:09.585 --> 45:10.752
Ling Fei.

45:10.794 --> 45:13.213
Where are you? What are you doing?

45:13.255 --> 45:14.840
Are you drinking?

45:16.049 --> 45:17.259
What?

45:17.301 --> 45:19.636
I know you're fooling around
with your friends all the time!

45:19.678 --> 45:21.680
What are you talking about?

45:21.722 --> 45:22.806
This is forbidden.

45:22.848 --> 45:26.894
Don't assume I know nothing,
you're such a mess!

45:26.935 --> 45:29.104
I didn't do anything wrong.

45:29.146 --> 45:30.981
You're out drinking with boys.

45:31.023 --> 45:33.150
Do you think we wouldn't find out?
I have eyes everywhere!

45:33.192 --> 45:37.029
It's 5:00 A.M. in the morning,
why are you calling me?

45:37.070 --> 45:40.324
To wake you up! Embarrass me again
and you're back in Hong Kong.

45:40.657 --> 45:43.368
Don't bring shame to the family!
Do you understand?

46:00.828 --> 46:01.462
Mark!

46:01.495 --> 46:03.297
Yo,

46:03.330 --> 46:04.231
What's going on baby?

46:04.265 --> 46:05.099
Yeah how you doing?

46:05.132 --> 46:06.267
What you working on?

46:06.300 --> 46:07.301
Just give me a second I'm
about to wrap this one up.

46:07.334 --> 46:08.202
Okay.

46:56.116 --> 46:56.950
Yeah, there it is man.

46:56.984 --> 46:58.085
I like that.

46:58.118 --> 46:58.787
What it do?

46:58.819 --> 47:00.622
It's crazy, man blessed man.

47:00.655 --> 47:01.488
I'm sorry, I'm late.

47:01.523 --> 47:02.156
It's all good.

47:02.189 --> 47:03.257
I got held up at the crib

47:03.290 --> 47:07.261
Man, you know, Stacy man
she just like on my neck.

47:08.195 --> 47:09.396
Anytime she can get ahold of me,

47:09.430 --> 47:11.265
she just won't let me leave.

47:11.298 --> 47:12.499
I know how that is.

47:12.534 --> 47:15.869
Now it's on a whole nother
level man, I can't even focus.

47:15.903 --> 47:17.371
I cannot I can't write a song.

47:17.404 --> 47:19.973
I got the music executive
calling me every second,

47:20.007 --> 47:21.275
he's hounded me, man.

47:21.308 --> 47:23.877
Probably on his way here sow I
was crazy.

47:23.911 --> 47:25.446
And I'm trying to figure out

47:25.479 --> 47:26.980
what am I doing for the mic,
man?

47:27.014 --> 47:27.948
There's no words coming out.

47:27.981 --> 47:30.951
You just find you gotta
look for inspiration

47:30.984 --> 47:32.019
in the real world, man.

47:32.052 --> 47:32.886
Right.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.421
Like Don't try to find it in the
paper.

47:34.455 --> 47:35.289
You know?

47:35.322 --> 47:36.256
Don't try to find it

47:36.290 --> 47:38.058
in comparing your music to
somebody else.

47:38.092 --> 47:40.294
The inspiration is in
the truth and is in life.

47:40.327 --> 47:41.563
See you in the middle of it
right now,

47:41.596 --> 47:43.464
it is the best time to
take advantage of it.

47:43.497 --> 47:47.167
The dramas, the good the bad,
things that are going on.

47:47.201 --> 47:49.203
All right girl, things is
going on with your family.

47:49.236 --> 47:52.106
And then you put that truth into
the song.

47:52.139 --> 47:53.340
And then that's the magic right
there.

47:53.374 --> 47:56.611
That's what people want, they
just really want the truth,

47:56.644 --> 47:57.679
you probably just needed to jump
in there,

47:57.712 --> 48:00.548
and just get on some music
and just put that truth,

48:00.582 --> 48:03.283
right out there at the
end and see what happens.

48:04.017 --> 48:04.686
that's what we are going to do.

48:04.719 --> 48:06.621
That's what we are doing.

48:06.654 --> 48:07.988
Look what we got going on
here?

48:08.021 --> 48:09.189
Speaker of the devil.

48:09.223 --> 48:13.260
Absolutely fucking nothing
amazing. Just as I expected.

48:13.293 --> 48:14.161
See didn't I knew it?

48:14.194 --> 48:17.498
You knew what, what's he
telling you?

48:17.532 --> 48:18.700
Is he telling you about all the
money

48:18.733 --> 48:20.702
I've invested in this album,
that's not getting anywhere?

48:20.735 --> 48:22.436
Or have you guys been making
some music?

48:22.469 --> 48:23.971
Listen, you want to hear it?

48:31.378 --> 48:32.479

48:32.514 --> 48:35.449

about it, I need a suit.

48:35.482 --> 48:36.684
I need a suit right now.

48:37.719 --> 48:38.586

48:40.755 --> 48:41.589

48:45.159 --> 48:48.028

48:52.767 --> 48:53.601
All right, give me, okay.

48:53.635 --> 48:54.468
In a minute.

48:54.501 --> 48:55.436
Okay. Yes.

48:57.705 --> 48:58.606
Your man, it's nuts.

48:58.640 --> 49:01.074
You believe this guy.

49:01.108 --> 49:05.647
Wow, Superman's back, and
I'm ready to hear that music.

49:05.680 --> 49:06.313
How did you just do-

49:06.346 --> 49:08.215
- Come on, what do you mean?

49:08.248 --> 49:09.082

He has got a lot of spirit-

49:23.497 --> 49:25.700
- Yeah, it's magic when he
gets on the mike though.

49:26.467 --> 49:28.135
If he got rid of that
girlfriend of his,

49:28.168 --> 49:29.102

49:29.136 --> 49:30.572

There pictures of a guy and
the girl,

1:04:21.028 --> 1:04:25.199

saying, "It is over."

1:04:25.232 --> 1:04:27.901

Are you okay.

1:12:01.055 --> 1:12:02.355
God.

1:12:08.453 --> 1:12:12.583
Ling Fei, I had no idea
that he's your friend.

1:12:13.417 --> 1:12:15.961
Would you ask him if he's okay?

1:12:17.572 --> 1:12:18.606
Are you okay?

for your

1:12:32.354 --> 1:12:33.729
Mr. and Mrs. Ling.

1:12:34.313 --> 1:12:36.190
Ling Fei was kidnapped in the U.S.

1:12:36.690 --> 1:12:39.318
Thankfully, I was able to
track her back to Hong Kong.

1:12:42.362 --> 1:12:46.909
And this big ass, black... Gorilla...

1:12:47.434 --> 1:12:48.870
Fat big gorilla?

1:12:50.454 --> 1:12:53.832
Right! Big gorilla...
Has helped us rescue Ling Fei.

1:12:55.584 --> 1:12:56.877
Really?

1:12:57.545 --> 1:12:59.412
I'm sorry man.

1:12:59.446 --> 1:13:00.413
Please forgive me.

1:13:03.551 --> 1:13:08.455
Sorry. You almost killed me.

1:13:08.488 --> 1:13:09.924
I promise no more

1:13:09.957 --> 1:13:10.925
Not really. You...

If I can teach, I teach, okay,
please.

1:13:21.936 --> 1:13:24.672
Kung Fu is not bad, I teach.

1:13:26.240 --> 1:13:27.440
Thank you.

1:13:30.661 --> 1:13:32.996
Mr. Ling, KK and his party are here.

1:13:43.090 --> 1:13:44.591
Hey, Mr. Ling!

1:13:44.633 --> 1:13:47.719
Father, they're the ones who kidnapped me!

1:13:47.761 --> 1:13:49.471
Listen! Mr. Ling...

1:13:51.098 --> 1:13:54.768
Old man! She understands nothing at all,
yet you still want her to run the company!

1:13:54.810 --> 1:13:55.811
You're fucking crazy!

1:13:55.853 --> 1:13:56.854

1:14:06.363 --> 1:14:07.990

1:14:08.031 --> 1:14:09.616
I will be back!

1:14:11.493 --> 1:14:13.036

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:18.417
It's all good.

1:14:58.165 --> 1:15:02.753
Ling Fei, I'm so glad you have
finally discovered yourself.

1:15:03.545 --> 1:15:05.547
I know you won't let me down.

1:15:51.786 --> 1:15:53.320
This place is beautiful.

1:15:55.189 --> 1:15:56.891
I can't believe this is all
yours

1:16:01.062 --> 1:16:02.863
Give me a second, let me take

1:16:02.897 --> 1:16:05.833
PA, where the fuck are

1:16:06.567 --> 1:16:08.002
- Hey Alex?

1:16:08.035 --> 1:16:09.804
I have been trying to reach you

1:16:09.837 --> 1:16:10.971
This is bullshit.

1:16:11.005 --> 1:16:12.339
I was just about to call
you man.

1:16:12.373 --> 1:16:13.374

I have got everybody

1:16:15.876 --> 1:16:17.044
and no one can find you.

1:16:18.746 --> 1:16:20.748
Hell you haven't even called me
in a week.

1:16:21.682 --> 1:16:22.917
I'm in China.

1:16:22.950 --> 1:16:25.920
What, can you say that
again.

1:16:25.953 --> 1:16:26.620
You are where?

1:16:26.654 --> 1:16:28.322
China, China can you hear me?

1:16:28.355 --> 1:16:30.391
China, what the fuck
are you doing in China?

1:16:30.424 --> 1:16:32.193
I mean I told you to let go of
everything

1:16:32.226 --> 1:16:34.395
that was holding you back, but
literally,

1:16:34.428 --> 1:16:35.896
leaving the entire country

1:16:35.930 --> 1:16:38.032
was the last thing I expected.

1:16:38.065 --> 1:16:39.900
We got an album to do.

1:16:39.934 --> 1:16:42.069
I know, I know trust me I
know.

1:16:42.103 --> 1:16:42.970

1:16:50.077 --> 1:16:51.679
What are you talking about?

1:16:51.712 --> 1:16:53.347
Look, I'm here.

1:16:56.851 --> 1:16:57.818
Are you serious?

1:16:57.852 --> 1:16:59.320
What the fuck, it's

1:16:59.353 --> 1:17:00.387
Come over here.

1:17:01.255 --> 1:17:02.189
Are you serious?

1:17:02.223 --> 1:17:03.958
I'm very serious.

1:17:03.991 --> 1:17:05.693
What are you doing here?

1:17:05.726 --> 1:17:06.760
What's up my ninja.

1:17:08.963 --> 1:17:10.030
I'm all right.

1:17:10.764 --> 1:17:13.067
I came half the world to see
you.

1:17:13.100 --> 1:17:14.301
All right, any place you go,

1:17:14.335 --> 1:17:16.137
don't forget I'm going to track
you down.

1:17:16.170 --> 1:17:21.008
This temple, rice fields,
caves, strip clubs.

1:17:21.041 --> 1:17:22.143
Anywhere.

1:17:22.176 --> 1:17:23.010
I'm sorry about this.

1:17:23.043 --> 1:17:24.145
Sorry about what?

1:17:24.178 --> 1:17:25.713
Who is this little tasty spring
roll?

1:17:25.746 --> 1:17:27.681
Come on man.

1:17:27.715 --> 1:17:28.550
What do you mean?

1:17:28.583 --> 1:17:29.750
This is Ling Fei, Ling Fei I'm
sorry.

1:17:29.783 --> 1:17:30.951
This is the ghost of Gwendolyn

1:17:30.985 --> 1:17:33.087
Ling Fei, pleasure to meet
you.

1:17:34.155 --> 1:17:35.789
Oh, boy.

1:17:35.823 --> 1:17:36.957
Ling Fei, how do you know PA?

1:17:36.991 --> 1:17:38.759
I'm just showing him around.

1:17:38.792 --> 1:17:40.261
I own this whole place right
here.

1:17:40.294 --> 1:17:41.295
- Really?
- Yeah.

1:17:41.328 --> 1:17:42.963
Congratulations to you.

1:17:42.997 --> 1:17:45.132
What are you doing with
this tortured soul?

1:17:46.500 --> 1:17:48.002
Come on, man.

1:17:48.035 --> 1:17:50.004
You know where I am. I'm in
Guilin.

1:17:50.037 --> 1:17:52.006
I flew halfway around
the world to see you,

1:17:52.039 --> 1:17:55.409
because I care about you and our
album.

1:17:55.442 --> 1:17:57.111
And if this brings you
the inspiration you need

1:17:57.144 --> 1:17:58.913
to get this album done.

1:17:58.946 --> 1:18:02.783
I'm totally for it here.
To deal look at me.

1:18:02.816 --> 1:18:04.485
This is what we're gonna do.

1:18:04.519 --> 1:18:06.854
I've got business here with you.

1:18:06.887 --> 1:18:10.090
And I need you back in LA in 48
hours.

1:18:11.091 --> 1:18:12.026
48 hours.

1:18:12.059 --> 1:18:14.995
48 hours. Have you
ever heard me sing PA?

1:18:15.029 --> 1:18:16.163
No, no.

1:18:16.197 --> 1:18:17.898
Think about it. Have you
ever heard me sing anything?

1:18:17.932 --> 1:18:18.567
No.

1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:19.500
If I don't see you in LA,

1:18:19.534 --> 1:18:21.101
I'm going to cut the fucking
track myself

1:18:21.135 --> 1:18:21.802
and finish the album.

1:18:21.835 --> 1:18:22.503
- All right.
- You got it?

1:18:22.537 --> 1:18:24.205
- Yes, yes.
- We're clear.

1:18:24.238 --> 1:18:25.072
Yes.

1:18:25.105 --> 1:18:27.341
All right. I got to take some
calls.

1:18:27.374 --> 1:18:31.979
I'll see you in LA in
48. Pleasure to meet you.

1:18:32.012 --> 1:18:33.214
Drop the spring roll.

1:18:33.247 --> 1:18:37.384
Come on man. Can you believe
this guy?

1:18:37.418 --> 1:18:39.086
Listen, get rid of that...

1:18:39.119 --> 1:18:41.055
Whatever that is that is on your
head.

1:18:41.088 --> 1:18:43.290
Know what, the deal
is. I dropped the hat.

1:18:43.324 --> 1:18:45.859
You dropped the girl, and
we finished the album.

1:18:50.864 --> 1:18:51.732
I'm sorry.

1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:57.771
Anyways, this place is
absolutely amazing.

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:02.076
I mean, really amazing.

1:19:02.109 --> 1:19:04.812
Yeah, I had forgotten
the beauty of my home.

1:19:04.845 --> 1:19:07.481
I don't want to leave again.
It's like I'm in a dream.

1:19:09.984 --> 1:19:12.920
It's crazy that you even
mentioned that.

1:19:12.953 --> 1:19:15.956
Like, I had this dream a while
ago,

1:19:15.990 --> 1:19:18.492
and I was driving through
the streets of Hong Kong.

1:19:18.526 --> 1:19:21.061
But I was also the
passenger in the backseat,

1:19:21.095 --> 1:19:23.497
and the beggar on the side of
the road.

1:19:23.531 --> 1:19:26.033
I had no idea what it meant
until now.

1:19:26.767 --> 1:19:30.871
You see in the dream, I
didn't know who I was.

1:19:30.904 --> 1:19:32.873
I had no control over anything.

1:19:32.906 --> 1:19:36.176
And now, I realize that
it was me in real life.

1:19:36.210 --> 1:19:38.245
I didn't know if I was PA the
boyfriend,

1:19:38.279 --> 1:19:41.248
or PA the artists, or
just some kid from Miami,

1:19:41.282 --> 1:19:44.218
who got lucky and made
it big in Los Angeles.

1:19:44.251 --> 1:19:47.321
You what is crazy, I
recently saw a kid get shot

1:19:47.354 --> 1:19:49.189
outside of a record store.

1:19:49.223 --> 1:19:52.026
And I remember thinking how
easily could have been me.

1:19:52.826 --> 1:19:55.429
You see, my music career was
suffering.

1:19:55.462 --> 1:19:56.698
I had the hardest time writing
songs,

1:19:56.731 --> 1:20:01.468
and I blamed Stacy constantly,
but it was my responsibility.

1:20:01.502 --> 1:20:05.873
Even Alex, as smart as ghost
of Gwendolyn tried to help,

1:20:05.906 --> 1:20:08.375
even though, I think he was
interested in making money

1:20:08.409 --> 1:20:11.879
more than anything else,
he was there for me.

1:20:11.912 --> 1:20:13.814
I guess I was hoping that one
day,

1:20:14.616 --> 1:20:18.319
someday things would change.

1:20:19.521 --> 1:20:21.488
I guess I was stuck in Someday
Isles.

1:20:22.890 --> 1:20:24.892
And then I saw you at the train
station,

1:20:24.925 --> 1:20:27.194
and I knew you were in trouble.

1:20:27.227 --> 1:20:29.129
And I had to take action.

1:20:29.163 --> 1:20:30.331
Not because anyone told me to,

1:20:30.364 --> 1:20:32.466
but because it was the right
thing to do.

1:20:33.635 --> 1:20:35.936
And in that moment, I was just
me.

1:20:37.304 --> 1:20:39.273
I was peaceful. I was calm.

1:20:39.306 --> 1:20:40.974
I felt like I was in control.

1:20:41.743 --> 1:20:44.945
Now I know that it's up to
me to make things happen.

1:20:44.978 --> 1:20:48.516
To come out of that Someday
Isle, to look inside of myself

1:20:48.550 --> 1:20:50.117
and to take responsibility.

1:20:50.984 --> 1:20:52.986
I'm going to take everything
that I've learned,

1:20:53.020 --> 1:20:55.055
and put into my whole album.

1:20:55.824 --> 1:20:59.293
You see for me, music is
everything.

1:21:00.260 --> 1:21:03.230
Our journey has helped us,
both of us,

1:21:03.263 --> 1:21:06.233
to discover who we truly are.

1:21:06.266 --> 1:21:09.036
I mean, I forgotten my soul.

1:21:09.069 --> 1:21:14.074
I, my parents have been so hard
on me. They're so demanding.

1:21:14.776 --> 1:21:17.911
But they also gave me
everything that I have.

1:21:17.945 --> 1:21:21.115
Even so I felt like I was
missing out on so much,

1:21:21.148 --> 1:21:23.984
like my friends would be
out while I was studying.

1:21:24.017 --> 1:21:25.553
That's why I love dancing.

1:21:25.587 --> 1:21:28.222
I can have fun and still get
good grades.

1:21:28.255 --> 1:21:31.158
When I was very young, maybe
five.

1:21:31.191 --> 1:21:33.026
I remember my father and I
looking out

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:34.696
of all these rice paddies.

1:21:34.729 --> 1:21:35.830
We had nothing.

1:21:35.864 --> 1:21:40.134
My father worked until he
owned every acre of land.

1:21:40.167 --> 1:21:43.504
He wanted us to have
everything, he wanted us,

1:21:43.538 --> 1:21:45.439
my sister and I to work hard to

1:21:45.472 --> 1:21:48.308
so we can always support
ourselves.

1:21:48.342 --> 1:21:50.043
I never knew there were people
out there,

1:21:50.077 --> 1:21:52.246
so eager to take this thing
away.

1:21:52.279 --> 1:21:54.281
It goes so far to kidnapped me.

1:21:54.948 --> 1:21:58.018
Now I understand why
they were so protective.

1:21:58.051 --> 1:21:58.887
I'm going to work hard.

1:21:58.919 --> 1:22:01.623
I'm going to take over my family
business

1:22:01.656 --> 1:22:06.293
and continue the legacy
and no my own, and hey,

1:22:06.326 --> 1:22:08.696
maybe I'll build a dance
studio in my office.

1:22:11.365 --> 1:22:14.168
Hey, you and I have been through
so much,

1:22:14.201 --> 1:22:16.336
in such a brief space.

1:22:20.040 --> 1:22:21.509
You saved my life.

1:22:22.342 --> 1:22:25.012
I know it's a bit strange to say
this,

1:22:25.045 --> 1:22:29.517
but I think closer to you
than I have anyone before,

1:22:29.551 --> 1:22:32.019
would you consider staying
here with my family.

1:22:32.754 --> 1:22:34.087
Are you serious?

1:22:34.121 --> 1:22:35.022
Yes.

1:22:35.055 --> 1:22:36.056
Oh my God.

1:22:37.124 --> 1:22:38.158
Are you serious?

1:22:38.192 --> 1:22:39.059
Yes.

1:22:41.261 --> 1:22:46.266
Look, the offers incredibly
tempting.

1:22:46.634 --> 1:22:49.537
But you know I got the ghost
of Gwendolyn up my ass right.

1:22:50.705 --> 1:22:52.339
Look, this experience

1:22:52.372 --> 1:22:54.609
was more than I could
have ever anticipated.

1:22:54.642 --> 1:22:56.544
My time with you is both more
challenging,

1:22:56.578 --> 1:22:59.313
and incredible at the same time.

1:22:59.346 --> 1:23:01.683
I've learned that I have my own
purpose

1:23:01.716 --> 1:23:03.417
and my destiny back home.

1:23:05.219 --> 1:23:08.121
I was hoping you were
gonna say otherwise.

1:23:08.155 --> 1:23:10.692
But I understand. It's okay.

1:23:10.725 --> 1:23:13.193
I could not have found
my balance without you.

1:23:14.194 --> 1:23:17.130
And I couldn't have realized
my destiny without you.

After all we've been through,
I just want to be with you.

1:27:59.914 --> 1:28:01.949
Are you serious, oh my God.

1:28:08.589 --> 1:28:11.726
I was just writing a song
about you, it's crazy.

Really fucking get here,

1:28:36.017 --> 1:28:39.687
it's taken 100 motherfucking
years to make this album.

1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:44.525
Right? 100 motherfucking
years, but I hear it.

1:28:44.559 --> 1:28:46.393
I hear the motherfucking music
playing

1:28:46.426 --> 1:28:48.495
and it sounds fucking great.

1:28:48.529 --> 1:28:51.065
It sounds fucking great, my man.

1:28:51.098 --> 1:28:52.499
I know you could do it

1:28:52.533 --> 1:28:55.069
and I had faith in you the whole
time.

1:28:55.102 --> 1:28:56.771
But you know what I hear now
besides the sounds of music,

1:28:56.804 --> 1:28:58.539
What do you hear?

1:28:58.573 --> 1:29:00.141
I hear the sound of money.

1:29:00.299 --> 1:29:02.593
You know how much I need you

1:29:03.260 --> 1:29:05.220
You know I've been thinking about you

1:29:05.512 --> 1:29:07.890
I never thought I'd meet you

1:29:07.931 --> 1:29:10.392
I love you
