WEBVTT

00:00.643 --> 00:02.143
Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier"...

00:02.146 --> 00:03.617
When I blew it with Will,

00:03.620 --> 00:05.460
I didn't just lose my best friend.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.481
I kinda lost my only friend.

00:07.484 --> 00:09.829
I'm good at my job
because I'm obsessive.

00:09.831 --> 00:11.198
But I know it doesn't always make me

00:11.200 --> 00:12.798
the easiest person to be around.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.366
We obviously have a connection.

00:14.368 --> 00:16.702
And what we do is too
important to risk messing up.

00:16.704 --> 00:18.904
I'm sorry I can't be the
girl you get ice cream with.

00:18.906 --> 00:20.306
I can get ice cream with anybody.

00:20.308 --> 00:22.774
You and me, we save the world.

00:22.776 --> 00:25.077
Emma Davies, MI6.

00:25.079 --> 00:26.512
You must be Agent Trowbridge.

00:26.514 --> 00:27.580
And Agent Chase?

00:27.582 --> 00:29.948
Interesting. Do you fancy ice cream?

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:39.093 --> 00:41.289
I still cannot believe you're here.

00:41.292 --> 00:43.158
I wasn't gonna miss
your birthday weekend.

00:43.161 --> 00:44.695
That's very sweet of you.

00:44.698 --> 00:46.559
Oh, you know what we
should do this weekend?

00:46.562 --> 00:47.929
What?

00:47.932 --> 00:49.734
This.

00:51.238 --> 00:53.038
Wow.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.973
I'm sorry. That was cheesy.

00:54.975 --> 00:56.307
That was. If you want to hop on a plane

00:56.309 --> 00:57.918
to London right now, I would understand.

00:57.921 --> 01:00.484
No, you're adorable.

01:00.487 --> 01:03.218
And if that was a line,
then it was very well done.

01:03.221 --> 01:04.781
No, that wa...

01:04.784 --> 01:06.851
- That was not a line. I am not that smooth.
- No?

01:06.854 --> 01:07.986
Mnh-mnh.

01:07.988 --> 01:08.954
Not at all.

01:11.725 --> 01:13.458
So, the line worked.

01:16.763 --> 01:20.931
Ohh.

01:21.968 --> 01:24.569
- Work?
- Always.

01:30.043 --> 01:31.176
Hey, guys.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.410
- Hey.
- Oh.

01:32.412 --> 01:34.279
And once again, we all beat Ray here.

01:34.281 --> 01:36.281
Cool. Can I get you a beer?

01:36.283 --> 01:38.015
- Yes, please.
- Good to see you, Emma.

01:38.017 --> 01:39.195
You, too.

01:39.198 --> 01:41.052
I didn't know we could
bring dates here now.

01:41.054 --> 01:42.387
Oh, c'mon, she's MI6.

01:42.389 --> 01:44.497
Besides, I've brought
a date here before.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.678
Just not when anybody else was around.

01:47.750 --> 01:48.659
Oh, great.

01:48.661 --> 01:50.294
You guys are early.

01:50.296 --> 01:52.429
Ooh, Brit in the house. What's up, Emma?

01:52.431 --> 01:53.931
Cheerio, pip pip!

01:53.933 --> 01:56.000
Oh, wow, you must have lived in London.

01:56.002 --> 01:57.902
Actually, no.

01:57.904 --> 02:00.926
Ray, you probably want to get
to why you called us all here.

02:00.929 --> 02:02.406
Oh, right-o.

02:02.408 --> 02:04.661
Look, guys, I should probably apologize.

02:04.664 --> 02:06.443
I know I sent out the usual group text,

02:06.445 --> 02:08.746
but for this mission,
I only need two of you.

02:08.747 --> 02:09.979
Unbelievable.

02:09.982 --> 02:11.248
- Aw.
- Ray...

02:11.250 --> 02:13.983
All right, which two, Ray?

02:13.985 --> 02:16.657
- You saw Emma out there, right?
- I did.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.793
And I gotta tell you,
buddy. She's a keeper.

02:18.796 --> 02:20.498
The three of us should
grab a beer sometime.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.435
Ray, I feel like we've
been down this road before.

02:22.437 --> 02:24.293
I'm gonna let Jai take this one.

02:24.295 --> 02:25.494
Okay.

02:25.496 --> 02:27.321
You stole his girlfriend,
broke his heart,

02:27.324 --> 02:29.057
and he pretty much wants you dead.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.559
I'm on the fence.

02:30.562 --> 02:32.969
Okay, uh, let's get our brief on.

02:32.971 --> 02:34.898
This is just a quick in-and-out...

02:34.901 --> 02:36.762
Bulgarian authorities
are having a hard time

02:36.765 --> 02:38.778
proving that a major
pharmaceutical company

02:38.781 --> 02:41.675
is also moving black market
opiates around the country.

02:41.678 --> 02:44.746
We need you to intercept a
truck so we can tie the narcotics

02:44.749 --> 02:46.114
back to the supplier.

02:46.116 --> 02:48.116
Just get that truck
and get out of there.

02:48.118 --> 02:49.000
No.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.377
So, you into humpback whales?

02:50.379 --> 02:52.721
- Am I into humpback...
- Humpback whales?

02:52.724 --> 02:55.218
Uh, do you know, I-I've never
thought about it, really.

02:55.221 --> 02:57.159
You haven't? I've thought about
it quite a bit. I'm actually...

02:57.161 --> 02:59.027
I think she's a good match for Will.

02:59.796 --> 03:02.497
Look at you being the bigger person.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.466
I know.

03:03.468 --> 03:04.800
It's so rare for me.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.404
I mean, it's not like Will
and I were ever together.

03:08.406 --> 03:09.672
That's true.

03:09.674 --> 03:11.607
Still...

03:11.609 --> 03:14.744
You know I ran into my
ex-husband last week.

03:14.746 --> 03:18.340
He's actually a good guy, but
he was with his new fiancée,

03:18.343 --> 03:22.083
and I swear it took every
ounce of self-control I had

03:22.085 --> 03:23.985
not to shoot both of them.

03:23.987 --> 03:25.587
- You should've.
- I know.

03:25.589 --> 03:27.655
I would've cleaned
up the bodies for you.

03:27.657 --> 03:31.058
Thanks.

03:31.060 --> 03:34.362
I'm just saying it's
okay to be human, Franks.

03:34.364 --> 03:36.297
- I'll try it.
- Will you?

03:36.299 --> 03:39.100
Not today, but, you
know, I'll let you know.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.403
All right, keep me...
Keep me in the loop.

03:41.405 --> 03:42.871
- In the meantime...
- Oh!

03:42.873 --> 03:43.872
Doing shots.

03:43.874 --> 03:46.541
- Correct.
- Lord.

03:46.543 --> 03:47.909
To humans.

03:47.911 --> 03:50.011
Salud.

03:52.214 --> 03:53.514
I'm so sorry.

03:53.516 --> 03:55.382
I'll be back in less
than 24 hours. I promise.

03:55.384 --> 03:58.118
Please, you know how many
dates I've had to leave?

03:58.120 --> 04:01.588
Have I made it clear
that I really like you?

04:01.590 --> 04:03.990
- Well, just remind me.
- Okay.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.266
Ray, tell us when they're
done loading the truck,

04:13.268 --> 04:14.701
and we'll move in.

04:19.173 --> 04:20.808
Okay, Will, last box is on.

04:20.810 --> 04:21.841
Let's do this.

04:21.844 --> 04:25.219
Let's go.

04:25.222 --> 04:28.142
_

04:28.143 --> 04:30.715
_

04:30.718 --> 04:33.819
_

04:33.822 --> 04:36.694
♪ Olé, olé, olé, olé ♪

04:44.933 --> 04:46.699
Hey!

04:46.701 --> 04:48.034
_

04:57.811 --> 04:59.845
Let's go!

05:04.952 --> 05:06.218
Good job, fellas.

05:06.220 --> 05:08.487
The Brazilian soccer hooligans.

05:09.556 --> 05:10.789
That was awesome.

05:15.762 --> 05:17.256
Did you see that woman?

05:17.259 --> 05:18.693
I think she might have super powers.

05:18.695 --> 05:20.332
It's time to go home. We're done.

05:20.334 --> 05:21.467
Yeah.

05:32.278 --> 05:33.745
Maybe we're not done.

06:02.775 --> 06:05.176
So, what's the story on
little Will Junior, here?

06:05.179 --> 06:06.377
Seriously?

06:06.380 --> 06:08.129
Is that baby really named Will?

06:08.132 --> 06:09.513
Don't ruin the fantasy, Ray.

06:09.515 --> 06:12.444
We just... We haven't been
able to locate his parents yet.

06:12.447 --> 06:15.181
Okay, what's some random
Bulgarian drug runner

06:15.184 --> 06:16.516
doing with a baby, anyway?

06:16.519 --> 06:18.553
Hold up... Uncle Ray's
done some homework.

06:18.556 --> 06:20.857
Turns out there's been a
rash of missing children

06:20.860 --> 06:22.259
in that region of Bulgaria.

06:22.261 --> 06:24.327
So this low-life isn't
just trafficking drugs.

06:24.329 --> 06:25.662
It's children, too.

06:25.664 --> 06:27.530
Babies being taken, sold into adoption,

06:27.532 --> 06:29.098
kids put on the black market.

06:29.100 --> 06:30.432
There's huge money in it.

06:30.434 --> 06:31.868
So let's go back there,
take this guy down.

06:31.870 --> 06:33.736
Maybe we can locate
Baby Will's family, then.

06:33.738 --> 06:35.471
The problem is no one seems to care

06:35.473 --> 06:37.740
about some local Bulgarian thug.

06:37.742 --> 06:40.043
Europol just needed to
connect that drug shipment

06:40.046 --> 06:41.786
to the international supplier.

06:41.789 --> 06:43.312
No one's even going after this guy?

06:43.314 --> 06:44.747
C'mon, Ray, send us in.

06:44.749 --> 06:45.848
I can't, man.

06:45.850 --> 06:50.719
I mean, there's no official mission...

06:50.721 --> 06:52.021
"But"...

06:52.023 --> 06:54.023
sounds like there's a "but" coming...

06:54.025 --> 06:55.992
- Ray.
- Come on, Ray.

06:55.994 --> 06:57.927
- Do the right thing, Ray.
- Be a man, Ray.

06:57.929 --> 06:59.195
Spit it out, Ray.

06:59.197 --> 07:01.492
- ...but...
- There it is.

07:01.495 --> 07:04.395
...if you want to go off-book
and take this guy down yourself,

07:04.398 --> 07:05.700
I'll try and keep it quiet.

07:05.702 --> 07:08.223
Still, an unsanctioned
operation on foreign soil, if...

07:08.226 --> 07:11.017
If something goes wrong,
you'll all go down.

07:11.020 --> 07:12.886
Look, you guys, I'm going in, okay?

07:12.889 --> 07:14.623
You... You got to make
up your own minds on this,

07:14.625 --> 07:16.377
but, uh... But I'm doing this.

07:16.380 --> 07:18.480
How cute is that baby?

07:18.482 --> 07:19.580
Pretty damn cute.

07:21.818 --> 07:23.218
Yeah?

07:23.220 --> 07:24.185
There you go.

07:24.187 --> 07:26.754
I sent you a pic.

07:26.756 --> 07:29.257
- Aww!
- Ay, mi...

07:29.259 --> 07:30.525
He's got Will's eyes.

07:30.527 --> 07:32.227
- We're going to the airport.
- Yeah.

07:32.229 --> 07:35.763
Wait, if this was an ugly baby,
would we still be doing this?

07:35.765 --> 07:37.031
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

07:37.033 --> 07:38.132
- I can't.
- Thanks.

07:38.134 --> 07:39.800
Ray, look, I know this
can get you in trouble,

07:39.802 --> 07:41.068
but if you could lend
us some ground support,

07:41.070 --> 07:43.170
- I'd appreciate it.
- I will see what I can do

07:43.172 --> 07:45.817
to get you some transportation
and a safe house.

07:45.820 --> 07:47.842
Thanks, b... Uh-oh.

07:51.247 --> 07:53.014
Well, I'm...

08:01.157 --> 08:02.590
What the hell is that?

08:02.592 --> 08:04.025
It's our transportation...

08:04.027 --> 08:05.660
and our safe house.

08:05.662 --> 08:08.328
Eventually I'm gonna have to murder Ray.

08:08.330 --> 08:09.730
I'm not gonna stop you.

08:09.732 --> 08:12.232
Oh, come on, y'all. It's
Spring Break Bulgaria.

08:12.234 --> 08:13.426
I'm with Standish.

08:13.429 --> 08:14.437
When I was a kid,

08:14.439 --> 08:16.202
my parents used to pile
us into one of these

08:16.205 --> 08:17.438
and drive us down the shore.

08:17.440 --> 08:18.460
How'd that turn out?

08:18.463 --> 08:20.173
Oh, we all wanted to kill each other.

08:20.176 --> 08:21.875
Exactly.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.710
- Oh, this is cozy.
- Sorry.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.079
Oh, wait, no, I was just gonna...

08:25.081 --> 08:26.746
You know what? I'm
just gonna go that way.

08:26.748 --> 08:28.515
- Yeah, sure.
- Just wait, all right.

08:28.517 --> 08:29.716
- Yeah.
- I'm just gonna sit.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.318
- I'm just gonna...
- Yo!

08:31.320 --> 08:33.419
The toilet's in the shower!

08:33.422 --> 08:34.955
What a time saver!

08:34.957 --> 08:36.990
Well, I guess I won't
be taking a shower.

08:36.991 --> 08:39.759
Guys, let's... let's
keep it down, all right?

08:39.760 --> 08:41.433
The baby's secure and napping.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.330
Mm, yeah, I feel like we
should've put the baby down

08:43.332 --> 08:45.631
- after we hashed out the plan.
- It's pretty simple.

08:45.633 --> 08:46.999
We're here to take
down a child trafficker,

08:47.001 --> 08:48.801
and we've literally
got nothing to go on.

08:48.803 --> 08:51.804
How can there be no regionalized
records of missing kids here?

08:51.806 --> 08:53.939
The police station in Melnik
is central to all the cases

08:53.941 --> 08:55.476
that Ray was able to dig up.

08:55.479 --> 08:57.311
They'll definitely have
more Intel in their files.

08:57.313 --> 08:58.747
- Okay, let's start there.
- Yeah.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.079
- Who's driving?
- Me.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.248
I will be driving. This
is not up for discussion.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.516
I need some space from that.

09:03.518 --> 09:05.161
- No co-pilots.
- Unh-unh.

09:05.164 --> 09:06.519
I don't trust you with that radio.

09:06.521 --> 09:07.953
You listen to K-pop. Stay there.

09:07.955 --> 09:09.589
Yeah, but I don't want to
listen to classical music

09:09.591 --> 09:10.490
- for the next five...
- Guys, the baby's sleeping.

09:10.492 --> 09:11.657
Shh, shh, shh, shh...

09:13.161 --> 09:16.262
Okay, well, who's gonna have
the first shift with the baby?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.663
- I'll do it.
- I'll do it.

09:17.665 --> 09:18.963
- Oh, you can do it.
- No, go ahead.

09:18.965 --> 09:20.898
- No, I... it's...
- No, look, we...

09:20.900 --> 09:22.503
We can do it together,
unless that's weird.

09:22.505 --> 09:23.935
It's not weird.

09:29.042 --> 09:31.209
So weird.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.936
You know what? Here.

09:59.939 --> 10:01.724
I'm just gonna squeeze in here.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.841
- Look at this. Look.
- Are you ready for a picture?

10:06.112 --> 10:07.544
What was that for?

10:07.547 --> 10:08.946
I'm gonna send it to my parents,

10:08.948 --> 10:10.414
tell them I got married and had a kid,

10:10.416 --> 10:12.016
totally freak them out.

10:12.018 --> 10:13.084
Oh...

10:13.086 --> 10:15.053
You really want to be a dad, don't you?

10:15.055 --> 10:16.120
Oh, definitely.

10:16.122 --> 10:18.022
Yeah, I love my parents.
They need grandkids.

10:18.024 --> 10:19.490
That's just a fact.

10:19.492 --> 10:21.659
Plus, I think it'd
be a ton of fun, so...

10:21.661 --> 10:24.989
And the world needs more of this.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.397
- I mean, there can't just be one.
- Right, it's not fair.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.433
It's not fair.

10:32.071 --> 10:34.104
You'd be a great dad.

10:34.106 --> 10:35.839
Thank you.

10:35.842 --> 10:39.110
And I think you'd make
an... interesting mom.

10:45.351 --> 10:47.951
I always thought that
I'd have a little girl.

10:47.953 --> 10:51.096
You know, I dreamed about
all the silly stuff...

10:51.099 --> 10:54.491
The bows, the ribbons, the...
The things that you teach her.

10:54.493 --> 10:56.627
I-I was a total girly-girl.

10:56.629 --> 10:58.295
I know, hard to believe.

10:58.297 --> 11:00.130
It's impossible to believe.

11:02.234 --> 11:03.633
Mm.

11:03.635 --> 11:05.447
Anyway, with this job,

11:05.450 --> 11:08.772
I don't think it's likely
either of us will ever have kids.

11:09.573 --> 11:11.506
Come on, never say never.

11:24.389 --> 11:27.763
Okay, look, I need you to be friendly

11:27.766 --> 11:29.033
when we're in there, all right?

11:29.036 --> 11:31.092
- I-I know how to be friendly.
- Mnh.

11:31.095 --> 11:32.795
And if they let us get a
look at their case reports,

11:32.797 --> 11:34.030
see if we can find the names

11:34.032 --> 11:35.162
of families with missing children.

11:35.164 --> 11:36.833
That way, we'll have somewhere to start.

11:36.842 --> 11:39.642
And, you know, friendly!

11:41.238 --> 11:44.139
The Chief Directorate's
office is right down here.

11:44.141 --> 11:46.342
Thank you! You're lovely.

11:46.344 --> 11:48.043
Too much.

11:48.045 --> 11:52.247
Sir, these two requested
a moment of your time.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.865
How can I help you today?

12:07.867 --> 12:09.934
Hi! We were actually
hoping that we could talk

12:09.936 --> 12:11.670
- to you about some...
- My wife and I just wanted to come in

12:11.672 --> 12:13.305
and thank you personally.

12:15.342 --> 12:16.941
Yeah, we were speeding like idiots,

12:16.943 --> 12:20.144
and, uh, Chief here
didn't give us a ticket.

12:20.146 --> 12:22.614
So...

12:22.616 --> 12:24.816
I'm just reminding the Chief

12:24.818 --> 12:27.519
that he and I have met previously.

12:27.521 --> 12:29.020
Oh.

12:30.224 --> 12:31.523
Oh.

12:31.525 --> 12:34.726
I remember you, too.

12:34.728 --> 12:36.261
Big soccer fan.

12:36.263 --> 12:38.563
Yes, huge.

12:38.565 --> 12:39.731
So, we should be going.

12:39.733 --> 12:40.794
Thank you.

12:40.797 --> 12:43.100
Maybe later, I will pay you a visit.

12:43.103 --> 12:45.903
Oh, I'd... I'd be careful with that.

12:45.905 --> 12:48.106
Yeah, the missus here, she
doesn't like surprise guests.

12:48.108 --> 12:50.674
Yeah. I get mad.

12:50.676 --> 12:52.176
Like, violently.

12:52.178 --> 12:54.612
Well, either way...

12:54.614 --> 12:57.448
I'll make sure I find you both.

12:57.450 --> 12:59.117
So, until then, I suppose.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.422
_

13:17.810 --> 13:19.812
_

13:22.675 --> 13:25.041
I can't believe you made me be friendly.

13:44.129 --> 13:45.195
Stop!

13:51.904 --> 13:53.166
_

13:53.169 --> 13:54.244
_

14:03.818 --> 14:05.716
_

14:09.453 --> 14:11.787
So that's a "no" on help
from the local authorities.

14:11.790 --> 14:13.556
Some of the police are in on it.

14:13.558 --> 14:15.992
Let's get the hell out of here.

14:25.870 --> 14:26.936
Hey, Emma.

14:26.938 --> 14:27.989
What's up?

14:27.992 --> 14:30.105
Ooh, day drinking. I like your style.

14:30.107 --> 14:31.974
Well, it's already the
afternoon in London,

14:31.976 --> 14:33.743
so, technically, I'm two pints behind.

14:33.745 --> 14:35.378
Makes sense.

14:35.380 --> 14:36.979
You want a drink?

14:36.981 --> 14:39.549
Ah, sorry. I'm not a big drinker.

14:41.252 --> 14:43.786
I'm totally kidding.
Yes, a beer, please.

14:43.788 --> 14:45.855
So, how long have you
and Will known each other?

14:45.857 --> 14:47.254
Uh, we met at Quantico.

14:47.257 --> 14:49.157
We became great buddies right away.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.927
Will used to let me cheat off his tests.

14:50.929 --> 14:53.162
Well, not exactly "let" me.

14:53.164 --> 14:55.297
- He doesn't know. Don't tell him that.
- I won't.

14:55.299 --> 14:58.567
As long as you don't tell him
what I got him for his birthday.

14:58.569 --> 14:59.544
Ooh, what is it?!

14:59.547 --> 15:01.414
No! No, no, no, no. Let me guess.

15:01.417 --> 15:05.305
Um, ooh, it's heavy,
but it's not too heavy.

15:05.308 --> 15:08.343
Is it a... doorknob?

15:08.346 --> 15:09.936
No.

15:09.939 --> 15:11.606
Why would I buy him a door...

15:11.609 --> 15:13.560
Uh, no, it's a watch.

15:13.563 --> 15:14.862
Ah!

15:14.865 --> 15:16.965
Wow.

15:17.896 --> 15:20.747
Um, how long have you two been dating?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.350
Six days.

15:22.430 --> 15:23.796
Six days.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.449
Don't... um, do you think you might

15:25.452 --> 15:27.497
be coming in a little bit hot?

15:27.500 --> 15:29.107
Not that I'm soliciting your opinion,

15:29.110 --> 15:30.809
but I have a very dangerous job.

15:30.812 --> 15:33.021
I have no interest in mucking around.

15:33.024 --> 15:34.957
If I feel something, I express it.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.359
Cool, totally. Cool.

15:36.362 --> 15:39.363
It's, um... It's just that if, say,

15:39.366 --> 15:41.661
- I were to receive a gift like that...
- Mm-hmm.

15:41.664 --> 15:44.294
...I would run away
like my hair was on fire,

15:44.297 --> 15:45.963
then I would melt my fingerprints off

15:45.966 --> 15:47.802
so I could never, ever be found.

15:47.805 --> 15:49.225
Well, yes, I mean, of course you would,

15:49.227 --> 15:50.628
'cause you're terrified
of being vulnerable

15:50.630 --> 15:52.088
with anyone who cares about you.

15:52.091 --> 15:53.899
Exactly.

15:53.902 --> 15:55.435
- Wait. What?
- Mm-hmm.

16:16.178 --> 16:18.512
I can't believe a cop is
taking children. Makes me sick.

16:18.514 --> 16:20.748
- He thinks nobody can touch him.
- We can.

16:20.750 --> 16:23.216
I tried reaching out to the
few families of missing kids

16:23.218 --> 16:25.385
that Ray found, but
they're too scared to talk.

16:25.387 --> 16:26.887
Well, that's why we're here.

16:26.889 --> 16:28.589
Let's find out where "here" is.

16:28.591 --> 16:30.691
Yeah.

16:30.693 --> 16:33.226
Jai, I'm gonna need you to
take a shift with the baby

16:33.228 --> 16:34.929
so that Standish can
start gathering background

16:34.931 --> 16:36.430
- on our police chief.
- It's all good, Will.

16:36.432 --> 16:38.465
I'm a multitasking rock star, right?

16:38.467 --> 16:40.934
Yeah, plus, I'm not taking
any shifts with any babies.

16:40.936 --> 16:42.294
I'm sorry.

16:42.297 --> 16:44.938
Babies are disgusting flesh
sacks of viruses and bacteria,

16:44.940 --> 16:47.674
and if you touch them, you
are literally touching poop.

16:47.676 --> 16:49.041
Okay.

16:49.043 --> 16:50.776
Obviously some issues
under the hood there.

16:50.779 --> 16:51.841
All right, got him.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.279
Vladimir Koslov, better known
to his friends as "Vlad,"

16:54.282 --> 16:55.915
although I doubt he has any.

16:57.071 --> 16:59.877
I'm looking up
better-known associates now.

17:01.322 --> 17:03.322
Uh, hello.

17:03.324 --> 17:04.656
Martyna Losinski.

17:04.659 --> 17:06.125
Polish, former special ops.

17:06.127 --> 17:07.326
Dishonorable discharge.

17:07.328 --> 17:09.362
Now a very attractive mercenary.

17:09.364 --> 17:10.997
Yeah, we met her.

17:10.999 --> 17:12.799
Hey, Jai, I'm sure
Vlad's looking for us.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.221
Can you at least take
the RV off the grid?

17:15.223 --> 17:17.391
That I can do. Give me 90 seconds.

17:17.394 --> 17:19.993
We'll be invisible to any form
of electronic surveillance.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.241
Thank you so much, baby hater.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.809
Jai doesn't like you.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.843
I don't know why.

17:24.845 --> 17:26.178
'Cause you're so sweet.

17:26.180 --> 17:27.480
He's an awful person, though.

17:27.482 --> 17:28.680
He doesn't like me, either.

17:28.682 --> 17:30.249
He's not a good judge of character.

17:30.251 --> 17:31.517
I don't hate babies.

17:31.519 --> 17:34.053
I just... fear them.

17:36.190 --> 17:37.656
Wow.

17:37.658 --> 17:39.291
So peaceful.

17:39.293 --> 17:41.360
- I love spots like this.
- Yeah.

17:41.362 --> 17:42.794
Yeah.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.830
Someone could scream really loudly,

17:44.832 --> 17:46.165
and you'd never hear them.

17:47.527 --> 17:49.292
That's unsettling.

17:50.842 --> 17:52.537
Hey, Standish is gonna
dig a little deeper

17:52.540 --> 17:54.439
into Vlad's background,
maybe hack into his e-mails,

17:54.441 --> 17:55.941
find out where he's operating from.

17:55.943 --> 17:57.776
You had them take DNA
samples of Baby Will

17:57.778 --> 17:59.044
- back at the Hive?
- Yeah.

17:59.046 --> 18:00.546
I love that you call
him that, by the way.

18:02.049 --> 18:04.049
I'm sure his parents would
talk, if we could find them.

18:04.051 --> 18:05.150
I can help with that.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.652
I'll try my contact at State.

18:06.654 --> 18:09.387
Great. Yeah, I'll reach, uh...
I'll reach out to New York.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.793
No, you beat me to it!

18:14.795 --> 18:17.029
I'm supposed to ring
you on your birthday.

18:17.031 --> 18:18.396
Did I catch you at a bad time?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.997
No, no, I'm just hanging out with Ray.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.433
Hey, happy birthday, buddy!

18:22.435 --> 18:23.935
You... You're with Ray?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.536
Well, what are... What
are you guys doing?

18:25.538 --> 18:27.939
Just getting to know each
other over a few beers.

18:27.941 --> 18:29.239
More than a few.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.108
- This girl can put 'em back!
- I'm English!

18:31.110 --> 18:32.944
- It's what we're good at.
- Oh, you're very English.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.478
Yeah.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.745
Oh, it's... fun.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.114
The fun one is her. I'm telling you.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.582
Hey, she's a keeper, man.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.617
- Don't screw this up.
- He's a piece of work.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.753
Yeah, he's a piece of something.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.422
- Well, I miss you, and...
- We both miss you!

18:45.424 --> 18:47.005
Just come back... Come back soon.

18:47.008 --> 18:48.392
Yeah, no, I-I intend to.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.302
Uh, I-I should probably, um...

18:51.997 --> 18:54.458
Okay, yeah, bye.

18:55.730 --> 18:57.730
Oh, wait... He's gone. He's gone.

19:00.356 --> 19:01.688
Ray and Emma miss me.

19:01.691 --> 19:03.939
They're together, and,
uh... And they miss me.

19:03.942 --> 19:05.549
Don't let Ray spin you out.

19:05.552 --> 19:07.444
- It's not a big deal.
- Thanks, Frankie.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.045
Yeah, out of everyone,
you should be the one

19:09.047 --> 19:10.180
to give me relationship advice.

19:10.182 --> 19:11.515
I appreciate that.

19:11.517 --> 19:13.583
Ooh.

19:13.585 --> 19:16.920
Well, now it's a family vacation.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.189
Come on, let's tap out Standish.

19:30.519 --> 19:32.144
Oh.

19:32.147 --> 19:34.363
- You changed that diaper in four seconds.
- Mm.

19:34.366 --> 19:35.722
That was rodeo fast.

19:35.725 --> 19:37.524
I've had lots of practice.

19:37.527 --> 19:39.451
I worked my way through
college as a nanny,

19:39.453 --> 19:43.856
so every diaper change got me
a beer at the local dive bar.

19:43.858 --> 19:45.557
That's a weird system.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.994
So, how's that "being the
bigger person" thing going?

19:48.996 --> 19:50.324
Seeing how he just acted,

19:50.327 --> 19:52.964
would you give me permission
to torture him, just a little,

19:52.966 --> 19:54.631
about Ray and Emma?

19:54.633 --> 19:56.400
What do you say, baby?

19:57.435 --> 20:00.136
Yes, we say go have fun with that.

20:00.139 --> 20:02.506
- I knew I liked this baby.
- I know.

20:09.883 --> 20:11.115
Okay...

20:11.117 --> 20:14.151
the little chiquito is asleep.

20:14.153 --> 20:16.660
Great.

20:16.756 --> 20:18.222
Great.

20:18.224 --> 20:20.224
Hey, Susan got a hit on our baby's DNA

20:20.226 --> 20:22.260
and the last known address of the mom.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.728
Don't know if she's still living there,

20:23.730 --> 20:25.533
- but we'll check it out in the morning.
- Good.

20:25.535 --> 20:28.231
Okay.

20:28.233 --> 20:29.441
"Remma."

20:29.444 --> 20:32.469
- What's that?
- It's, uh, Ray and Emma's couple name.

20:33.672 --> 20:34.872
- "Remma."
- I like that.

20:34.874 --> 20:36.059
- It's catchy.
- That's adorable.

20:36.061 --> 20:37.708
No, it's not catchy.
What... are you having fun?

20:37.710 --> 20:39.309
- Is this fun for you?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:39.311 --> 20:41.211
All right, y'all, I
found these in the fridge.

20:41.214 --> 20:42.931
- I don't know how good they are.
- Ooh.

20:42.933 --> 20:45.248
They got pictures of Gorbachev on them.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.284
Yeah, that's Lenin.
Read a book, will you?

20:47.286 --> 20:50.120
Whatever. It's Will's birthday,
and we gotta celebrate,

20:50.122 --> 20:51.655
'cause it may be one of the last ones.

20:51.657 --> 20:53.356
- He's that old.
- Hey, watch it.

20:53.358 --> 20:57.227
Um, you have the biggest
heart of anyone I know.

20:57.229 --> 20:58.295
To Will.

20:58.297 --> 21:00.930
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

21:02.033 --> 21:03.098
- Oh, God!
- Oh!

21:03.100 --> 21:04.500
Oh, that did not age well.

21:04.502 --> 21:06.803
Oh, how's it ice cold
yet still tastes warm?

21:06.805 --> 21:08.838
Mnh.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.507
- Seriously, Jai?
- Huh?

21:11.509 --> 21:12.750
- Oh, my God.
- Really?

21:12.753 --> 21:15.527
- Yeah.
- Hey, I'm, uh...

21:15.530 --> 21:17.211
I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier.

21:17.214 --> 21:19.649
It's... It's unforgivable.

21:19.651 --> 21:22.284
So...

21:22.286 --> 21:24.386
Happy birthday, dork.

21:24.388 --> 21:26.456
Thank you.

21:26.458 --> 21:28.602
And I appreciate you not
making a big deal out of it.

21:28.605 --> 21:30.526
It makes me uncomfortable. You know...

21:30.528 --> 21:31.789
Yeah, of course.

So, Standish has been monitoring
e-mails and police chatter,

22:05.429 --> 22:06.895
but Vlad's disappeared.

22:06.897 --> 22:08.964
Good news is Susan's
contact found a lead.

22:08.966 --> 22:11.933
Hopefully, Baby Will's mom
will help us smoke him out.

22:11.935 --> 22:15.368
Mm, Simona Borisov, and
her house isn't too far.

22:15.371 --> 22:17.639
- It's the perfect excuse for a morning walk.
- Mm.

22:17.641 --> 22:20.408
She's probably not gonna let
you call him "Baby Will," though.

22:20.410 --> 22:21.776
Mm. We'll see.

22:21.778 --> 22:23.477
When Ray and Emma have a baby,

22:23.480 --> 22:25.313
maybe they'll let you call it Will.

22:33.256 --> 22:34.762
Why do we have to do this?

22:34.765 --> 22:36.504
This isn't fun for either one of us.

22:36.507 --> 22:39.127
Because you're the only
one who hasn't taken a turn.

22:39.129 --> 22:40.793
What are you doing?

22:40.796 --> 22:42.862
Uh, Frankie wanted me to go into town,

22:42.865 --> 22:45.129
see if there was any police
checkpoints looking for us,

22:45.132 --> 22:48.000
so I thought I would combine
that with my morning run.

22:48.003 --> 22:49.169
Want to come?

22:49.171 --> 22:50.503
Get some exercise?

22:50.505 --> 22:52.339
No.

22:53.608 --> 22:55.289
Why aren't you watching the baby?

22:55.292 --> 22:56.676
I did.

22:56.678 --> 22:57.878
It drank stuff.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.146
I waved the bear at it.

22:59.148 --> 23:00.513
It's fine.

23:00.515 --> 23:02.349
You gotta stop calling
the baby "it," man.

23:02.351 --> 23:04.284
He's a baby. What's wrong with you?

23:04.286 --> 23:06.353
Okay...

23:06.355 --> 23:09.489
You know how sometimes I can be...

23:09.491 --> 23:11.524
particular or fastidious or critical

23:11.526 --> 23:14.228
when things aren't going just
exactly the way that I want?

23:14.230 --> 23:15.995
Sometimes or all the time, always?

23:19.267 --> 23:21.767
Well, that's why I won't ever have kids.

23:22.737 --> 23:25.637
No child deserves to grow
up with a father like that.

23:27.075 --> 23:28.607
It's not fair to them.

23:28.609 --> 23:32.444
All right, man, I'll tag in for you.

23:32.446 --> 23:36.315
But you've changed a lot in
the little time I've known you.

23:36.317 --> 23:38.117
I wouldn't close any doors.

23:44.225 --> 23:45.925
He needs a diaper change, doesn't he?

23:45.927 --> 23:46.859
He does.

23:46.861 --> 23:47.994
Yeah.

23:48.062 --> 23:49.128
Yeah.

23:49.130 --> 23:51.462
All right, stinky butt, let's do it.

23:57.518 --> 23:58.546
I'm just being real.

23:58.549 --> 23:59.915
You have to at least consider the fact

23:59.917 --> 24:01.506
that Ray and Emma are
already in love, right?

24:02.976 --> 24:04.987
You know how you've gotten
a little more playful and fun

24:04.989 --> 24:06.490
- since we started working together?
- Yeah.

24:06.492 --> 24:08.980
- Yeah, I hate it.
- Mm.

24:08.982 --> 24:10.581
All right, this is it.

24:39.003 --> 24:40.312

24:40.604 --> 24:42.773

24:43.563 --> 24:45.496

We have information about your baby.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.900
Kosta?

24:49.902 --> 24:51.101
Where he is?

24:51.103 --> 24:53.704
He's okay. He's okay.
He's in a safe place.

24:53.706 --> 24:56.807
Oh, my God, thank you.

24:56.809 --> 25:00.143
We can bring him to you,
but... why do you have a gun?

25:00.145 --> 25:01.779
Vladimir.

25:01.781 --> 25:03.848
He cames here, he take Kosta,

25:03.850 --> 25:06.316
like he takes everyone he wants selling.

25:06.318 --> 25:08.519
Next time, he take me.

25:08.521 --> 25:10.153
Why didn't you tell anyone?

25:10.155 --> 25:11.321
Who do I tell?

25:11.323 --> 25:12.490
He is police.

25:12.492 --> 25:14.057
There's nobody to help.

25:14.059 --> 25:15.292
Don't worry.

25:15.294 --> 25:16.393
We'll help you.

Hi there.

25:59.637 --> 26:01.537
Get his car keys.

26:06.143 --> 26:07.843
You should have killed him.

26:07.845 --> 26:10.679
Remind me to never piss
off a Bulgarian woman, huh?

26:10.681 --> 26:12.750
Do you have somewhere
you can go and hide?

26:12.753 --> 26:14.149
My sister in Sofia.

26:14.151 --> 26:15.417
Okay, you tell us where,

26:15.419 --> 26:16.952
and we'll meet you there with your son.

26:16.954 --> 26:19.118
He's fine, but we need to
make sure you're both safe.

26:19.121 --> 26:22.290
I'm never safe if Vlad is alive.

26:22.292 --> 26:24.125
You must stop him.

26:24.127 --> 26:26.561
We will.

Yeah, super badasses.

This isn't gonna go well, is it?

28:26.179 --> 28:27.244
All right.

28:41.934 --> 28:44.146
Just let me know when
the mother is safe.

28:44.149 --> 28:45.450
Bye, Ray.

28:46.774 --> 28:49.573
Hey, so, Ray's having the
mom put in protective custody.

28:49.576 --> 28:53.779
He, uh... He also told me not
to worry about Emma being alone

28:53.781 --> 28:56.515
and that "he's got my back,"
which is cool, I guess.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.521
Oh, yeah, you sound psyched about it.

28:58.524 --> 28:59.790
Yeah.

28:59.793 --> 29:02.093
Um, I'm just gonna call Emma real quick.

29:02.096 --> 29:03.356
- Dude.
- Huh?

29:03.359 --> 29:05.223
- What are you doing?
- It's not a big deal.

29:05.225 --> 29:06.590
I'm just gonna call her and say "hi,"

29:06.592 --> 29:09.060
maybe, you know, find
out what's going on there.

29:09.062 --> 29:11.362
You dial, and I'll shoot you.

29:12.232 --> 29:14.138
That's aggressive.

29:14.141 --> 29:15.373
You call her,

29:15.376 --> 29:17.836
you're just telling Emma
that you don't trust her.

29:17.838 --> 29:19.570
She is not Gigi...

29:19.572 --> 29:23.674
She's not some 23-year-old
girl bouncing from you and Ray

29:23.676 --> 29:26.244
because it's fun to make two
very old guys look like idiots.

29:26.246 --> 29:28.228
Okay, "very old" feels like piling on...

29:28.231 --> 29:30.448
Listen, she's great.

29:30.450 --> 29:34.485
She's a little tiny for
my taste, but she's great.

29:34.487 --> 29:35.854
Don't screw it up.

29:37.157 --> 29:38.958
If there's one thing
that you've taught me,

29:38.961 --> 29:40.891
it's that you shouldn't
stop trusting someone

29:40.893 --> 29:42.993
until they give you a reason to.

29:44.179 --> 29:46.046
You're right, yes.

29:46.049 --> 29:47.575
I'll put this away. Thank you.

29:47.578 --> 29:49.144
Mm.

29:49.147 --> 29:51.147
Okay.

29:51.150 --> 29:52.884
I don't know what I was thinking.

29:52.887 --> 29:54.247
- It's just...
- Happens.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.783
Susan?

29:55.786 --> 29:57.152
Hey, hey, what happened?

29:57.155 --> 29:58.822
- I got attacked.
- What?

29:58.825 --> 30:01.294
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- Vlad.

30:01.297 --> 30:02.778
The baby.

30:06.883 --> 30:08.049
Great, you're here.

30:08.052 --> 30:09.380
Hey, one sec.

30:09.383 --> 30:11.550
This mission isn't exactly on the books.

30:11.553 --> 30:13.786
I don't want to lose the
deposit on this motor home.

30:13.789 --> 30:15.189
And...

30:16.193 --> 30:17.659
What's up?

30:17.662 --> 30:20.297
I got you something.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.965
It's a book.

30:22.968 --> 30:25.068
Oh, there's no words... Close call.

30:25.070 --> 30:26.370
It's a journal.

30:26.372 --> 30:27.704
It is a journal.

30:27.706 --> 30:29.072
Thank you.

30:32.444 --> 30:33.510
When I feel like I want

30:33.512 --> 30:35.330
to try and change
something about myself,

30:35.333 --> 30:38.415
I find that writing
things down is helpful.

30:38.417 --> 30:40.802
Well, what would I want
to change about myself?

30:41.786 --> 30:44.354
Never mind. I'm going
down a list in my mind.

30:44.356 --> 30:46.289
Look, what you said
yesterday about running away

30:46.291 --> 30:48.257
as if you're on fire,
that really struck a chord.

30:48.259 --> 30:50.259
- It did?
- Yeah, that used to be me.

30:50.261 --> 30:52.361
Always going after unattainable partners

30:52.363 --> 30:54.597
and sabotaging friendships,

30:54.599 --> 30:57.634
and then trying to "I'm
sorry" my way out of it.

30:57.636 --> 30:58.768
Sound familiar?

30:58.770 --> 31:00.369
Whoa.

31:00.378 --> 31:02.278
I should be writing this down.

31:04.688 --> 31:07.455
In a journal like the
one you just gave me.

31:07.458 --> 31:09.679
- That...
- That's right.

31:09.681 --> 31:10.780
Thank you.

31:10.782 --> 31:12.448
You're very welcome.

31:13.864 --> 31:15.018
What the hell happened?

31:15.020 --> 31:16.213
Martyna happened.

31:16.216 --> 31:17.554
She took the baby.

31:17.556 --> 31:18.755
What?

31:18.758 --> 31:20.377
Uh, I-is everybody okay?

31:20.380 --> 31:22.147
Oh, my neck's fine. My pride's hurt.

31:22.150 --> 31:23.549
I told you... Super powers.

31:23.552 --> 31:25.126
This is Vlad cleaning up loose ends.

31:25.128 --> 31:26.901
I can't believe that hot
girl kicked all our asses.

31:26.903 --> 31:28.129
- The what?
- What now?

31:28.131 --> 31:29.731
- What is wrong with you?
- She tried to kill us.

31:29.733 --> 31:30.999
Did she, though?

31:31.001 --> 31:34.036
'Cause, like, we're all alive, so...

31:35.706 --> 31:37.505
I'll drop it.

31:37.507 --> 31:39.374
All right, guys, we're
gonna get that baby back.

31:39.376 --> 31:42.153
- How did she find us?
- There was a thing on the teddy bear.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.012
- Tracker?
- Did Martyna take the teddy bear with her?

31:44.014 --> 31:45.413
Either that or he went back to the city.

31:45.415 --> 31:47.149
Couldn't you reverse-trace
the signal to locate them?

31:47.151 --> 31:49.517
- Worth a shot.
- No, that only works if she was dumb enough

31:49.519 --> 31:51.286
- to leave the tracker on...
- I found her.

31:51.288 --> 31:52.721
Wow, she's that dumb.

31:52.723 --> 31:54.955
All right, let's get this
thing back on the road.

31:54.957 --> 31:57.659
Well, for a second, it was a fun trip.

31:57.661 --> 31:58.841
Hey, we find Tyna,

31:58.844 --> 32:01.028
and she'll lead us
to Vlad and Baby Will.

32:20.717 --> 32:22.189
All right, there she is.

32:22.192 --> 32:23.784
Take it slow.

32:23.786 --> 32:25.275
She's just standing there.

32:25.278 --> 32:26.333
I don't see a gun.

32:26.336 --> 32:28.713
Yeah, she could probably take
you out with that teddy bear.

32:34.508 --> 32:36.330
What took you so long?

32:41.305 --> 32:43.767
So, we're supposed to believe
that you're Tina Marek?

32:43.770 --> 32:45.322
- From Brooklyn?
- Marek...

32:45.325 --> 32:46.542
Brighton Beach, born and raised.

32:46.544 --> 32:47.978
Look, I'm telling the truth.

32:47.981 --> 32:49.783
How come we can't find
any official records

32:49.786 --> 32:51.364
of any agency assignments, then?

32:51.367 --> 32:53.534
I could ask your little
team the same question.

32:53.537 --> 32:54.697
I'm C.I.A.

32:54.699 --> 32:55.999
I've been given the freedom to operate

32:56.001 --> 32:57.767
under deep cover for years.

32:57.769 --> 32:58.868
Must be nice.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.136
It is.

33:00.138 --> 33:01.604
She mostly checks out.

33:01.606 --> 33:03.139
I confirmed special ops records,

33:03.141 --> 33:05.408
but deep-cover missions are classified.

33:05.410 --> 33:07.843
Looks like we gotta
take her at her word.

33:07.845 --> 33:09.245
Or not.

33:09.247 --> 33:10.779
Okay, why do you think
I left the tracker on?

33:10.781 --> 33:12.315
Do you really think I'm that dumb?

33:12.317 --> 33:13.882
Ooh, I can't say yet. We just met.

33:13.884 --> 33:16.285
I did it because I need
backup to take Vlad down.

33:16.287 --> 33:17.620
But why take the baby?

33:17.622 --> 33:18.720
Because Vlad asked me to.

33:18.722 --> 33:20.422
Being his number two is my cover.

33:20.424 --> 33:21.856
Look, we don't have time for this.

33:21.858 --> 33:23.825
He's spooked and packing
up his whole operation.

33:23.827 --> 33:26.294
You want to save that baby and
a whole bunch of other children?

33:26.296 --> 33:27.895
We have to act now.

33:32.402 --> 33:33.935
Stay here.

33:34.856 --> 33:35.963
Funny.

33:35.966 --> 33:37.266
Spy humor.

33:37.269 --> 33:39.874
So, it looks like Tina is on our side.

33:39.876 --> 33:42.577
Yes! New team member! What's up?!

33:42.579 --> 33:45.012
Uh, look, Tina wants us
to help her take down Vlad.

33:45.014 --> 33:46.981
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it our way.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.351
She is not in charge, okay?

33:49.353 --> 33:51.085
Let's hit it. I'm driving.

33:51.087 --> 33:53.353
- Okay.
- We're gonna get those kids out.

33:53.356 --> 33:55.154
She was handcuffed.

33:55.157 --> 33:56.557
Yeah, I like her.

33:56.559 --> 33:58.225
Me too.

33:58.227 --> 33:59.727
We know.

34:04.133 --> 34:05.510
Follow my lead.

34:05.513 --> 34:07.668
If you're my prisoners, I
can get you all the way in.

34:37.364 --> 34:40.065
Shh! Shh, shh, shh!

34:42.203 --> 34:43.902
_

34:48.909 --> 34:50.710
Vlad, I got you a present.

34:50.712 --> 34:52.911
I caught them tailing me.

34:52.914 --> 34:54.781
Bravo, Martyna.

34:56.516 --> 35:00.051
So, which government should
I send your bodies to?

35:00.054 --> 35:01.220
You can kill us.

35:01.222 --> 35:02.421
It won't matter.

35:02.423 --> 35:03.955
We're just the tip of the spear.

35:03.957 --> 35:06.257
The United States government
knows all about your operations,

35:06.259 --> 35:08.293
and now that your idiot
friend brought us here,

35:08.295 --> 35:10.061
they'll know exactly
where to send the troops

35:10.063 --> 35:11.797
for your extradition to the Hague.

35:19.620 --> 35:20.979
_

35:22.541 --> 35:25.078
_

35:38.791 --> 35:40.558
By the time your countrymen get here,

35:40.561 --> 35:42.717
they'll find nothing but your corpses.

35:42.720 --> 35:44.229
_

35:47.934 --> 35:49.234
Close those doors.

35:59.346 --> 36:01.479
Hey.

36:17.263 --> 36:18.662
Hi!

36:20.331 --> 36:22.265
Come on, boys, let's go.

36:22.268 --> 36:24.034
We got to get Baby Will.

36:25.137 --> 36:26.303
I need that baby.

36:28.841 --> 36:30.741
Come on.

36:30.743 --> 36:32.743
Hey, I'm here.

36:32.745 --> 36:34.805
All right, I'm here. It's okay.

36:34.808 --> 36:36.947
Just hang on. We're gonna
get you out of there.

36:36.949 --> 36:38.754
I got you.

36:38.757 --> 36:39.923
Come on.

36:39.926 --> 36:41.217
Okay, focus.

36:46.425 --> 36:48.825
Okay, we're clear.

36:50.930 --> 36:53.964
Baby Will and hostages secure.

36:53.966 --> 36:55.565
It's all you guys now.

36:57.746 --> 36:59.879
_

37:02.754 --> 37:04.074
_

37:06.478 --> 37:08.577
Move.

37:21.093 --> 37:22.191
Let's do this.

37:23.363 --> 37:25.130
- You okay?
- Yep.

37:25.133 --> 37:26.465
Here we go.

37:47.921 --> 37:49.433
_

38:32.537 --> 38:36.573
Okay, remember where we are, Martyna.

38:36.576 --> 38:38.511
I'll be free before sundown.

38:39.882 --> 38:41.802
You won't live until sundown.

38:43.691 --> 38:46.659
Tina, that's not our style.

38:47.607 --> 38:49.707
It's not his style.

38:53.476 --> 38:56.544
What a buzzkill.

38:56.547 --> 39:00.160
Oh, good, Frankie, you made a friend.

39:00.163 --> 39:01.296
Come on.

39:09.642 --> 39:12.097
Hey, guys, guys, great news.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.332
All the kids are gonna be
reunited with their families,

39:14.335 --> 39:16.369
and because Vlad was
operating across borders,

39:16.372 --> 39:18.072
he'll be tried by an
international tribune

39:18.075 --> 39:19.402
for violating human rights.

39:19.405 --> 39:21.957
He's gonna spend the rest of
his worthless life in prison.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.743
That's exactly what that big
bad man deserves, isn't it?

39:24.746 --> 39:26.168
- Yeah.
- Yes, it is. Yes, it is!

39:26.171 --> 39:29.527
So, I guess it's time to say
goodbye to this little guy, huh?

39:29.530 --> 39:31.329
- Mm!
- I'll see you around, Baby Will.

39:31.332 --> 39:33.035
It's Kosta.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.371
Sorry, yes, Kosta.

39:34.374 --> 39:35.506
You know what?

39:35.509 --> 39:36.675
That fits, too.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.145
Huh?

39:38.148 --> 39:42.285
Buena suerte, chiquito
precioso tesoro. Ay.

39:42.288 --> 39:43.824
Bye, little man.

39:43.827 --> 39:47.965
Hey, uh, would you
mind if... if I, uh...

39:47.968 --> 39:49.434
Yeah, go nuts.

39:49.437 --> 39:51.637
Here you go.

39:51.640 --> 39:53.140
What a good baby!

39:56.014 --> 39:59.048
S-So, that new-baby
smell, that's, uh...

39:59.051 --> 40:00.417
That's a thing, huh?

40:00.420 --> 40:01.452
- It's real.
- Mm-hmm.

40:01.455 --> 40:03.322
- That's a thing.
- Yep.

40:03.325 --> 40:05.925
Hey, you have a good life.

40:05.928 --> 40:07.128
All right.

40:09.900 --> 40:13.001
Okay, here comes your
mom, s-so you should, uh...

40:13.004 --> 40:13.936
Kosta!

40:13.939 --> 40:15.439
Okay.

40:16.444 --> 40:18.121
Kosta.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.423
Mm.

40:23.232 --> 40:26.099
Thank you all so much.

40:26.102 --> 40:27.401
Thank you.

40:30.876 --> 40:32.480
Thank you so much.

40:32.483 --> 40:34.550
Welcome.

40:37.523 --> 40:39.090
Thank you.

40:42.798 --> 40:45.545
Nice work, everyone. Peace out.

40:45.548 --> 40:47.326
- Thanks, Tina.
- All right, now.

40:47.329 --> 40:49.397
Bye.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.600
She'll be back.

40:51.603 --> 40:53.070
How do you know that?

40:53.073 --> 40:54.467
I don't.

40:54.470 --> 40:56.095
I just really hope so.

40:57.367 --> 40:58.686
Oh, okay.

41:04.017 --> 41:05.550
Oh, hey, hey, guys, check this out.

41:05.553 --> 41:07.123
You didn't have to do this.

41:09.096 --> 41:10.328
What?

41:10.331 --> 41:12.264
Oh, this is...

41:12.267 --> 41:14.501
This is just amazi...

41:16.423 --> 41:17.522
And you had it engraved.

41:17.525 --> 41:18.858
Of course I did.

41:18.861 --> 41:20.561
This is the nicest
gift I've ever gotten.

41:20.564 --> 41:21.830
Oh, gosh.

41:21.833 --> 41:23.866
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

41:25.271 --> 41:27.205
Oh, I-I gotta try it on.

41:30.907 --> 41:33.407
What did you two get up
to while we were gone?

41:33.410 --> 41:34.381
Oh, nothing.

41:34.384 --> 41:37.068
She just kinda changed
the whole path of my life.

41:37.071 --> 41:38.070
What?

41:38.073 --> 41:40.029
It's a long story. I'll tell you.

41:40.032 --> 41:42.725
Better yet, check out my journal.

41:42.728 --> 41:45.787
Oh, no thanks.

41:45.790 --> 41:47.342
All right, good night, you guys.

41:47.345 --> 41:48.693
- Night!
- Night!

41:48.696 --> 41:51.397
- I even like the box.
- Oh!

41:51.400 --> 41:52.533
Like a cat.

41:53.861 --> 41:56.201
I wish Will would nuzzle me like that.

41:56.204 --> 41:59.171
You just say everything that
comes into your head, don't you?

41:59.174 --> 42:01.708
Oh, you should write
that in your journal.

42:01.711 --> 42:03.444
Oh, maybe I will.

42:06.585 --> 42:08.652
"Dear Diary..."

42:08.655 --> 42:13.437
"Susan mean to me."

42:19.056 --> 42:23.709
"Frankie not so nice, either.

42:23.712 --> 42:25.177
Minus two."
