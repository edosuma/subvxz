00:00.090 --> 00:01.880
melinda: previously on ghost whisperer...

00:01.880 --> 00:03.540
let's have a baby.

00:03.540 --> 00:04.980
oh,god,i love you.

00:04.980 --> 00:08.800
you did conceive,but your body didn't support the pregnancy.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.100
you have to understand--you move between the world of life and death.

00:13.100 --> 00:16.129
sometimes you come back from one with a touch of the other.

00:16.129 --> 00:17.090
a touch?

00:17.090 --> 00:18.040
of death.

00:18.040 --> 00:18.930
be careful.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.130
it might brush off.

00:20.130 --> 00:21.130
on what?

00:21.130 --> 00:22.750
on what you touch.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.210
well,what is this prescription?

00:24.210 --> 00:25.220
it's for a hormone.

00:25.220 --> 00:27.350
it helps the embryo attach itself.

00:27.350 --> 00:29.740
basically makes it feel more at home so it can-

00:29.740 --> 00:31.280
-and this is all we need?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.530
yeah.

00:34.310 --> 00:37.760
so we're gonna be able to have a baby?

00:41.220 --> 00:42.340
really?

00:42.340 --> 00:44.330
i can't believe you worked on wall street.

00:44.330 --> 00:45.140
neither can i.

00:45.140 --> 00:46.130
uh,i told you that.

00:46.130 --> 00:47.650
no,you told me he hates suits.

00:47.650 --> 00:49.190
i told you he hated being a suit.

00:49.190 --> 00:51.020
a suit who is on his way to a corner office.

00:51.020 --> 00:51.980
-what can i say?
-well,i gotta tell you,

00:51.980 --> 00:55.260
i'm glad i'm finally getting a chanceto meet the legendary jim clancy.

00:55.260 --> 00:56.710
he's heard a lot about you.

00:56.710 --> 00:57.750
you can hear a lot about somebody

00:57.750 --> 00:59.620
when they've worked 80 hour weeks together.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.300
so listen,jim,you don't missthe anxiety

01:01.300 --> 01:03.820
and the tensionof tearing open that journal the moment you wake up,huh?

01:03.820 --> 01:06.250

04:32.390 --> 04:34.350

04:48.340 --> 04:50.170

04:55.730 --> 04:56.900
hunter: hey,where's nat?

04:56.900 --> 04:59.320
oh,she's in my old room,playing.

04:59.320 --> 05:00.730
old room playing?

05:00.730 --> 05:02.310
yeah,don't worry.she's ok.

05:02.310 --> 05:05.520
well,i mean,the house has been locked down and closedfor a few months now.

05:05.520 --> 05:08.600
it might be rustic to you,but i think it's a little rickety.

05:13.980 --> 05:16.490
i don't think we should be in here.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.890
this is hunter's room.

05:22.610 --> 05:24.390
where'd you go?

05:29.420 --> 05:31.550
is this for me?

05:32.660 --> 05:34.650
what do i do with it?

05:37.190 --> 05:40.320
wait,is this a game?

06:02.670 --> 06:04.480
hunter: natalie!

06:05.750 --> 06:08.990
hey,sweetie,you said that nat was in your old room,right?

06:08.990 --> 06:09.970
yeah.isn't she?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.300
no,no.i mean,i checked all the bedrooms,

06:11.300 --> 06:13.120
but there's so many stairways,and these doors--

06:13.120 --> 06:14.690

06:37.290 --> 06:38.860

06:38.860 --> 06:40.730

06:41.700 --> 06:44.410

06:44.410 --> 06:46.640
natalie,who were you talking to?

06:46.640 --> 06:47.880

06:52.930 --> 06:54.650
mommy,there was someone in there!

06:54.650 --> 06:56.210
you scared him away.

06:56.210 --> 06:58.150
he wanted me to find something.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.290
oh,there she is.

06:59.290 --> 07:02.060
hey,kiddo--

07:02.450 --> 07:05.790

07:12.870 --> 07:16.970

08:20.260 --> 08:24.940
gthere's berry-picking in the morning,directions to the trails for riding,lunch,

08:24.940 --> 08:27.500
then at 4:00,cocktail-croquet--

08:27.500 --> 08:29.130
ah,sport of champions.

08:29.130 --> 08:31.490
and tomorrow night,the rehearsal dinner.

08:31.490 --> 08:34.730
it's really sweet of them to organize all this.

08:35.659 --> 08:37.309
what was he like?

08:37.309 --> 08:38.600
natalie's dad?

08:38.600 --> 08:40.030
ah,he was a little bit like hunter.

08:40.030 --> 08:43.630
you know,kinda low-key but friendly.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.600
you know,they'd been together since college.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.360
so they spent some time here.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.920
probably...

08:48.920 --> 08:50.520
what?

08:50.820 --> 08:54.150
just must be hard for him to let go.

08:54.150 --> 08:57.820
before the ant thing,i heard natalie talking to somebody--

08:57.820 --> 08:59.380
right,to her imaginary friend,huh?

08:59.380 --> 09:02.040
yeah,the friend was whispering back.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.150
oh,no.

09:03.150 --> 09:04.860
you know,little kids can see spirits.

09:04.860 --> 09:06.420
she's still young enough.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.480
and you think it's tricia's first husband?

09:08.480 --> 09:10.080
he died,she's getting remarried.

09:10.080 --> 09:12.050
how would you feel?

09:12.050 --> 09:14.910
probably about as mad as a mob of red ants.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.460
hey,melinda.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.450
meet another guest.

09:21.450 --> 09:23.350
this is christopher murray,an old friend of hunter's.

09:23.350 --> 09:24.720
-hi,nice to meet you.
-nice to meet you.

09:24.720 --> 09:26.650
and you know my mom,of course,margaret.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.910
yeah,well,you know,she rescued me on one of her morning walks.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.240
it's not that easy to find this place.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.770
well,we're obviously glad you did.

09:33.770 --> 09:36.090
so why don't we get you settled.

09:36.090 --> 09:37.220
sure.

09:37.220 --> 09:41.610
oh,yeah,this,uh,a little something for the groom.

09:41.610 --> 09:43.540
isn't that thoughtful?

09:43.540 --> 09:47.140
christopher and hunter have known each other since they were 15.

09:47.140 --> 09:49.020
now they're opening a restaurant together.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.680
it's a place i invested in in dallas i told you about.

09:51.680 --> 09:52.390
oh,yeah.

09:52.390 --> 09:55.430
i'm sure it's hard to keep it all straight with this mogul.

09:55.430 --> 09:57.920
one second we're slinging around rich guys' golf clubs

09:57.920 --> 10:00.220
and the nextecond,he is the rich guy.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.240
hold on a second.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.080
i mean,you were the one who actually came up with the ideafor the restaurant in the first place,not me.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.850
opening one was my idea,but everything else was yours.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.970
the concept,the name.

10:08.970 --> 10:10.950
what is the name?

10:10.950 --> 10:13.560
axiom steakhouse.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.170
hmmyou'll have to ask the genius what that means.

10:16.170 --> 10:18.550
ah,come on,i can't brag about my old friend?

10:18.550 --> 10:20.190
no,no,keep braggin'.

10:20.190 --> 10:22.190
no problem.just save some for the toast.

10:22.190 --> 10:24.900
let's get you a room,shall we?

10:26.410 --> 10:27.500
see you later,darling.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.110
bye,melinda.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.880
i'm so glad that one of his friends took initiative.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.800
hunter's not in touch with his family,and most of his friends are from work.

10:36.800 --> 10:42.930
he won't admit it,but i think he kept his list shortso it wouldn't be too much about him.

10:46.050 --> 10:48.030
where is she going?

10:48.030 --> 10:51.910
you know,i take my eyes off her for one minute...

10:52.280 --> 10:54.770
it's so unlike her,wandering off like that.

10:54.770 --> 10:57.740
you know what,i can go check if you want,'cause i'm going out for a run,anyway.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.060
you sure?

11:01.030 --> 11:02.590
thanks.

11:02.590 --> 11:04.430
natalie?

11:14.320 --> 11:16.190
natalie?

11:21.800 --> 11:24.090
it's pretty down here,huh?

11:25.450 --> 11:29.240
you know,they had a stream like this where i grew up,too.

11:32.910 --> 11:35.630
did your friend bring you out here?

11:35.630 --> 11:38.080
it's ok if he did.

11:38.080 --> 11:42.410
i know that most grown-ups don't believe in imaginary friends,but i do.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.830
is he here with you right now?

11:48.470 --> 11:52.140
he doesn't like to be around peoplebecause he's really sick.

11:53.770 --> 11:56.740
ok,well,that's hard.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.670
you know,your mom told me that your dad was really sick,

12:00.670 --> 12:02.060
do you think maybe that's why he's being so shy--

12:02.060 --> 12:04.930
i don't want to talk about this anymore.

12:04.930 --> 12:07.800
ok,i'm sorry.

12:09.190 --> 12:10.340
do you mind if i talk to him?

12:10.340 --> 12:11.540
no!

12:11.540 --> 12:13.730
i don't want you to and neither does he.

12:13.730 --> 12:14.400
why not?

12:14.400 --> 12:15.670
because he's mad.

12:15.670 --> 12:17.810
he's really mad.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.280
mommy,mommy!

12:31.280 --> 12:32.100
well,hello,princess!

12:32.100 --> 12:33.240
you have to come with me.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.590
he wants you to see something.

12:34.590 --> 12:35.800
who,your friend?

12:35.800 --> 12:37.870
you know what,baby,i can't play right now.

12:37.870 --> 12:38.980
the rehearsal dinner's about to begin.

12:38.980 --> 12:41.220
mommy,he says it's important.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.080
he says you have to come now.

12:43.080 --> 12:44.400
please,please,please?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.380
ok,but listen,it has to be quick.

12:46.380 --> 12:47.380
-quick,quick.
-come on,let's go.

12:47.380 --> 12:48.310
all right!

12:48.310 --> 12:50.510
he wants us to follow him!

12:53.150 --> 12:54.780
nat...

12:55.580 --> 12:58.350
ok,what you want to show me?

13:05.240 --> 13:07.030
did you do that?

13:07.950 --> 13:10.390
that means he wants you to look inside.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.420
that's the game.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.970
right,the game.

13:14.970 --> 13:16.740
ok.

13:23.980 --> 13:25.820
mommy!

13:26.590 --> 13:29.290
who put an ice pick in the linen drawer?

13:29.290 --> 13:30.390
did you put that in there?

13:30.390 --> 13:31.450
no!

13:31.450 --> 13:32.860
i don't know why he did that to you.

13:32.860 --> 13:33.880
natalie,you know what?

13:33.880 --> 13:35.050
stop.

13:35.050 --> 13:36.610
stop with the imaginary friend.

13:36.610 --> 13:39.390
no more games,not like these.

13:39.750 --> 13:41.320
sweetie...

13:41.320 --> 13:42.920
i love you.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.390
i love you so much,and nothing is going to change that.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.610
but i'm getting married tomorrow.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.840
no matter what.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.250
do you understand?

13:58.440 --> 14:00.040
natalie?

14:00.040 --> 14:02.240
can i come in?

14:05.200 --> 14:08.040
i heard about what happened to your mom.

14:08.490 --> 14:10.880
it must have been really scary.

14:10.880 --> 14:13.920
i don't know why he's being so mean to her.

14:17.100 --> 14:19.290
what are you drawing?

14:20.310 --> 14:23.830
that's me and mommy catching butterflies.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.190
it's lovely.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.860
what are the other ones?

14:33.120 --> 14:35.270
that's owen.

14:35.870 --> 14:37.850
owen?

14:38.360 --> 14:40.330
is that your friend?

14:41.850 --> 14:44.120
he's a little boy.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.400
are those leg braces?

14:47.820 --> 14:50.140
is that what you meant when you said he was sick?

14:52.580 --> 14:55.890
why does he look so sad?

14:57.740 --> 15:01.910
because he says something very bad is going to happen.

15:08.040 --> 15:13.310
i-i don't mean to be dense,but i don't understand why you're asking me.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.690
why would i know this boy?

15:14.690 --> 15:16.390
he's not even real.

15:16.390 --> 15:21.830
sometimes kids will model imaginary friendsafter real people that they've met.

15:21.830 --> 15:25.190
so did nat ever see anyone maybe with leg braces?

15:25.190 --> 15:27.510
you know,it could have been from a while ago.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.950
maybe in the hospital when jeremy was sick?

15:30.950 --> 15:35.940
i have never seen nat with this boyat the hospital or anywhere.

15:35.940 --> 15:38.890
but i gotta say,i'm really proud of you,honey.

15:38.890 --> 15:40.770
i mean,my gosh...

15:40.770 --> 15:42.590
look at how creative you are--

15:42.590 --> 15:43.960
owen's real.

15:43.960 --> 15:44.710
of course.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.040
in your mind,of course.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.410
mommy,i didn't make him up.

15:48.410 --> 15:50.320
well,let's take a look at these pictures.

15:50.320 --> 15:54.140
someone decided to give him a red shirt and blue pants--

15:54.140 --> 15:56.520
but i didn't draw those.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.840
i just drew this one.

15:59.910 --> 16:01.630
wait,that one's in marker.

16:01.630 --> 16:02.620
those are in crayon.

16:02.620 --> 16:04.380
we don't have any crayons here.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.780
i know those drawings.

16:05.780 --> 16:06.680
don't you?

16:06.680 --> 16:07.950
why would i,mom?

16:07.950 --> 16:09.240
you drew them.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.650
there was a game you played that summer.

16:11.650 --> 16:13.090
a strange little game.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.600
with these drawings?

16:14.600 --> 16:17.160
with your made up friend.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.510
my made up friend?

16:18.510 --> 16:19.710
what was the game?

16:19.710 --> 16:23.180
it was sort of a word game,with a treasure hunt mixed in.

16:23.180 --> 16:26.100
you'd hide objects around,and they spelled out words somehow.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.320
wait,wait,i-- i seem to remember this,

16:29.320 --> 16:32.050
but it's a game that you showed me,mom.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.720
you showed me how to play.

16:33.720 --> 16:38.950
you took the first letterof each hidden thingand put it together,right?

16:38.950 --> 16:41.050
no,sweetheart,i remember distinctly.

16:41.050 --> 16:46.230
i used to think,goodness,my tricia's working awfully hardfor me to believe--

16:46.230 --> 16:47.790
owen did it!

16:47.790 --> 16:49.420
he hid the clues.

16:49.420 --> 16:50.530
he still does.

16:50.530 --> 16:51.730
ok,nat.honey,look--

16:51.730 --> 16:55.520
you know what,tricia,why don't you and i go and take a walk?

16:56.340 --> 17:00.040
am i supposed to believei just conveniently forgot all this?

17:00.040 --> 17:04.720
that i used to see ghosts,including a boy ghost i used to play with?

17:04.720 --> 17:08.540
all children believe in thingsthey stop believing in as adults.

17:08.940 --> 17:14.420
memories fade,and people have no room for it next to their logic and reason.

17:14.890 --> 17:15.569
but you do.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.349
well,i don't have a choice.

17:17.940 --> 17:18.619
ok.

17:18.619 --> 17:20.819
so let's say this owen is real.

17:20.819 --> 17:21.619
what now?

17:21.619 --> 17:23.200
we have to find out what he wants from you.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.510
other than wrecking my wedding?

17:24.510 --> 17:27.130
well,we're ok in one way--at least he wants to talk to you.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.360
now we just have to get him to cut to the chase,which is why i brought you here.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.700
here?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.860
is his voice in the babbling brook?

17:33.860 --> 17:35.710
does he use a tree phone?

17:35.970 --> 17:37.350
i remember my wedding day,too.

17:37.350 --> 17:39.600
i was also a little on edge.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.620
i'm sorry,i don't mean to be disrespectful.

17:41.620 --> 17:42.700
it's just,i'm so stressed out--

17:42.700 --> 17:44.520
he's here.

17:44.520 --> 17:46.160
where?

17:50.510 --> 17:54.420
he's a little shy,so he doesn't liketo stay in one place at a time--

17:54.420 --> 17:56.390
owen.hi.

17:56.390 --> 17:57.090
i'm melinda.

17:57.090 --> 17:59.180
look,i came here to tell youthat tricia,

17:59.180 --> 18:01.460
she is not having fun playing your game--

18:01.460 --> 18:02.650
she's not supposed to.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.360
are you talking to him right now?

18:04.360 --> 18:06.520
whatever it is you want her to know,just tell her.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.410
no.

18:07.410 --> 18:09.160
ok,you don't understand.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.740
she doesn't have time to play your gamebecause she's getting married today.

18:11.740 --> 18:13.610
look,since the two of you can talk to each other,

18:13.610 --> 18:15.190
why doesn't he just play the game with you?

18:15.190 --> 18:16.890
no!

18:18.140 --> 18:18.920
what was that?

18:18.920 --> 18:20.410
she has to play.

18:20.410 --> 18:23.020
tell her if she doesn't,she'll be sorry.

18:23.020 --> 18:23.790
tell her!

18:23.790 --> 18:24.980
he says that you have to play.

18:24.980 --> 18:25.880
you're the only one.

18:25.880 --> 18:27.190
you know what?

18:27.190 --> 18:30.590
i know you're trying to help,but i walk down the aisle in 6 hours,and,

18:30.590 --> 18:34.490
uh,this is,uh,this is just too much for me.

18:34.490 --> 18:36.840
i'll see you back at the lodge.

18:47.030 --> 18:51.660
trish,honey,everyone's getting together outsidefor some candids before the ceremony.

18:51.660 --> 18:54.380
are you still obsessing over that seating chart?

18:54.380 --> 18:56.980
if i could think,i'd be done already.

18:56.980 --> 18:58.790
just tell them i'll be down in about 10 minutes.

18:58.790 --> 19:01.000
i'd better tell them 20.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.010
mom,seriously,if you don't stop...

19:16.720 --> 19:19.410
ok,fine.

19:19.930 --> 19:21.930
let's play.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.300
what am i scared of?

20:03.660 --> 20:04.640
any luck?

20:04.640 --> 20:07.370
sure would help if i had more than a first name.

20:07.370 --> 20:10.720
you tried cross referencing the lodge nameor the street name...

20:11.080 --> 20:11.870
yeah,sorry.

20:11.870 --> 20:13.350
of course you have.

20:13.770 --> 20:14.580
it's just trish is an old friend.

20:14.580 --> 20:15.950
i'm a little worried about her.

20:15.950 --> 20:17.430
you and me both.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.680
if we don't get a handle on this ghost soon...

20:19.680 --> 20:21.210
i know,don't say it.

20:47.040 --> 20:48.250
you guys seen trish?

20:48.250 --> 20:49.540
she was supposed to be down here to take some pictures.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.230
oh,she's upstairs obsessing over the seating chart.

20:52.230 --> 20:55.110
um,i'm gonna go,uh,track trish down.

21:10.780 --> 21:12.620
bob.

21:12.620 --> 21:15.030
who's bob?

21:15.470 --> 21:17.940
what is this,apples?

21:18.670 --> 21:22.450
you want me to bob for apples?

21:23.930 --> 21:26.940
good for you.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.000
well,she's not in her room.

21:44.350 --> 21:45.980
i'm sure she'll be here any second,it's just--

21:45.980 --> 21:48.450
well,we can both help you look.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.150
*************

22:04.440 --> 22:06.090
paah,just get it off!just get it off!

22:06.090 --> 22:07.310
it's off,it's off.

22:07.310 --> 22:09.630
sweetie,it's off.listen to me,hey.i got it off,ok?

22:09.630 --> 22:11.750
it's the last one.it's the last one,i swear.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.680
why is he doing this?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.220
i just want this to end!

22:15.220 --> 22:16.430
well,it's gotta be a message.

22:16.430 --> 22:17.490
we just have to figure out--

22:17.490 --> 22:20.790
no,we don't,ok?please save it.

22:21.710 --> 22:23.260
can't you see she's been through enough?

22:24.130 --> 22:25.290
look,i know you guys are trying to help,

22:25.290 --> 22:27.080
and you're old friends and we appreciate it.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.600
but the last thing trisha needs to hear about right now is ghosts.ok?

22:29.600 --> 22:30.860
so please.

22:30.860 --> 22:32.110
it's ok.

22:32.470 --> 22:35.220
let's face it,we all have the same thing on our minds,even nat.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.110
and i'm sure i'd miss jeremy too,if i knew him,but i don't,so--

22:37.110 --> 22:38.680
we get it,ok?

22:38.680 --> 22:41.850
just take care of your fiancee.

22:45.950 --> 22:48.840
the game is leading to something,some answer.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.630
there's something he wants her to know.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.580
natalie said you take the first letterfrom every word,right?

22:53.580 --> 22:58.640
right,so far we have ants,ice pick,and leeches.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.830
a-i-l.ail?

23:01.830 --> 23:03.130
what does that mean?

23:03.130 --> 23:04.350
ailment?

23:04.350 --> 23:06.170
i mean,natalie said owen was sick,right?

23:06.170 --> 23:08.620
so maybe the subject of the message is ailment.

23:08.620 --> 23:11.480
yeah,but what disease would he havewhere he'd have to wear leg braces?

23:11.480 --> 23:14.060
polio,but only if he died a long time ago.

23:14.060 --> 23:17.450
well,the lodge has been in tricia's family for generations.

23:17.450 --> 23:19.470
um,there's hemiplegia.

23:19.470 --> 23:20.760
muscular dystrophy--

23:20.760 --> 23:22.010
ooh,wait.

23:22.010 --> 23:24.040
that might be what i need to get his name.

23:26.460 --> 23:27.300
there you go.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.300
the owen grace muscular dystrophy foundation.

23:30.300 --> 23:32.220
hit the mission statement.

23:33.550 --> 23:36.090
"founded in 1981 by the grace family

23:36.090 --> 23:39.050
in honor of their son,owen,who died...

23:40.190 --> 23:41.660
but he didn't die of the disease.

23:41.660 --> 23:43.870
he drowned in morton creek.

23:43.870 --> 23:45.830
which is here,right on the property.

23:45.830 --> 23:47.810
and where natalie was playing.

23:47.810 --> 23:49.860
and probably tricia,too.

23:49.860 --> 23:53.890
wait,you don't think maybe she had something to do with his death?

23:54.890 --> 23:56.680
owen?

23:56.680 --> 23:58.860
owen.

23:58.860 --> 24:00.660
we need to talk.

24:00.660 --> 24:02.820
look,i know what happened.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.150
i know that you drowned here.

24:05.150 --> 24:08.510
i can help you,ok,but you need to talk to me.

24:11.830 --> 24:13.930
trish is done playing your game.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.460
she can't be.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.530
it's not over yet.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.370
people don't want to play games that hurt them.

24:18.370 --> 24:20.050
hurt tricia?

24:20.050 --> 24:21.470
i'm trying to help her.

24:21.470 --> 24:23.470
with ants and ice picks and leeches?

24:23.470 --> 24:24.780
she hates that stuff!

24:24.780 --> 24:25.630
exactly.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.510
but that's a clue,too!

24:28.210 --> 24:30.040
what does that mean?

24:30.040 --> 24:31.370
what is a clue?

24:31.370 --> 24:33.290
no,i'm not telling you.

24:33.290 --> 24:36.890
it's our game,she has to figure it out.

24:36.890 --> 24:37.840
not you.

24:37.840 --> 24:39.060
ok...

24:39.640 --> 24:42.340
owen,what if i get her to keep playing?

24:42.340 --> 24:43.540
then will you tell me what happened?

24:43.540 --> 24:45.990
that is my best deal,ok.

24:45.990 --> 24:48.660
you have to tell me what happened here.

24:50.420 --> 24:52.510
this is where i first met her.

24:59.340 --> 25:00.930
wait up!

25:01.670 --> 25:03.090
wait up!

25:03.090 --> 25:04.950
but they wouldn't.

25:06.100 --> 25:09.080
i'll be right back.wait there.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.790
tricia came back with a pie of rope.

25:17.830 --> 25:20.090
there.now you can cross.

25:28.890 --> 25:31.120
careful!

25:35.880 --> 25:38.390
we went back to her house and played till dark.

25:38.390 --> 25:40.640
the next day i came back to see her again.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.940
only she wasn't there...

25:43.750 --> 25:45.720
but they were.

25:49.670 --> 25:51.510
trish?

25:51.510 --> 25:53.720
tricia!

25:53.720 --> 25:55.150
tricia didn't come.

25:55.150 --> 25:57.880
i thought maybe she was already on the other side.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.650
and i really wanted to play.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.630
so that's why you're still here?

26:20.630 --> 26:22.750
because you blame her for what happened?

26:22.750 --> 26:23.920
no.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.400
i just told you,she wasn't even here.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.910
i wanted to see her,so i waited.

26:28.910 --> 26:30.000
that's all.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.750
and you've been waiting here ever since?

26:32.750 --> 26:34.980
i knew she'd come back...

26:34.980 --> 26:37.300
i just didn't know she'd be in trouble.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.850
what kind of trouble?

26:38.850 --> 26:40.550
it's a grown-up secret.

26:40.550 --> 26:42.840
she wouldn't want anyone else to know.

26:43.230 --> 26:44.370
i gave her the clues.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.910
well,whatever it is that you gave her,it's not enough.

26:46.910 --> 26:48.040
yes,it is.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.220
she just missed a few.

26:50.220 --> 26:52.310
tell trish to keep playing.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.720
i'm not suggesting that we look for more clues,

26:57.720 --> 27:00.220
but if you could at least look at what we have--

27:00.220 --> 27:00.940
no.

27:00.940 --> 27:02.910
tricia,i understand.

27:02.910 --> 27:05.060
no,i don't think you do,melinda.

27:05.060 --> 27:07.120
this is my wedding day.

27:07.760 --> 27:10.830
look what i found a few minutes agoin what would have been my wedding bed.

27:10.830 --> 27:11.850
it's a rope.

27:11.850 --> 27:14.640
the same onethat you helped owen cross the creek with.

27:15.610 --> 27:16.860
rope,that's an "r," right?

27:16.860 --> 27:19.240
ok,and we've got an a-i-l.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.210
what is that,rail?

27:21.210 --> 27:22.970
or liar.

27:22.970 --> 27:26.100
that would describe the ghostfor ever letting me think this would be over.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.910
he said that you have all the clues that you need,

27:27.910 --> 27:29.520
you just haven't figured them out yet.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.840
what does that mean?

27:30.840 --> 27:31.840
that we're almost there.

27:31.840 --> 27:33.600
let's just finish this,ok?

27:33.600 --> 27:35.620
once and for all.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.800
yeah,i saw those in there before.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.220
who do they belong to?

27:42.220 --> 27:43.590
it said "bob" in the mirror.

27:43.590 --> 27:45.750
i--wait...

27:45.750 --> 27:47.380
bob could mean--

27:47.380 --> 27:49.970
short for robert.rgl.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.460
natalie said that owen led her here.

27:51.460 --> 27:52.800
maybe there's something we missed.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.460
not unless it's hunter's boxers.

27:58.110 --> 27:59.900
or this.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.620
a gift for the groom from your old friend chris.

28:08.760 --> 28:10.760
what is this?

28:11.020 --> 28:14.970
it's hunter and christopher from 12 years ago.

28:14.970 --> 28:16.480
trish,can i...

28:23.030 --> 28:25.350
robert langowski.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.440
oh,wait.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.320
rgl?

28:31.320 --> 28:33.180
bob?

28:34.350 --> 28:36.140
the liar...

28:36.140 --> 28:38.410
it's hunter.

28:55.450 --> 28:56.690
what's keeping her?

28:57.570 --> 29:03.400
there must be a dozen checksmade out to christopher for way morethan we agreed on.

29:03.400 --> 29:04.840
goes,what does all of this mean?

29:04.840 --> 29:07.850
whatever it is,i think owen was protecting you.

29:07.850 --> 29:08.910
from hunter?

29:08.910 --> 29:10.620
from robert langowski.

29:10.620 --> 29:13.140
the restaurant in dallas,axiom steakhouse?

29:13.140 --> 29:15.060
it doesn't even exist.

29:15.060 --> 29:18.080
christopher was blackmailing him.

29:20.790 --> 29:22.980
threatening to out him...

29:23.260 --> 29:25.610
the way he hid the present,the lies--

29:25.610 --> 29:27.380
yeah,i think there's more.

29:27.850 --> 29:30.450
i just got off the phone with one of my police friends.

29:30.770 --> 29:36.090
no one under the name hunter claytonor robert langowski ever went to the harvard business school.

29:36.520 --> 29:38.370
i'm sorry,trish.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.830
ireland,of course.

29:46.830 --> 29:49.730
trica's always wanted to go there,so for our honeymoon--

29:49.760 --> 29:51.860
robert langowski!

29:51.860 --> 29:53.110
honey,come on.

29:53.110 --> 29:54.830
-i found it,the picture of you and christopher.
-excuse us.

29:54.830 --> 29:55.690
-honey,what are you doing?
-don't touch me!

29:55.690 --> 29:57.150
-you're not supposed to be down here yet.
-everything...

29:57.150 --> 29:58.220
none of it was real.

29:58.220 --> 29:59.980
************

29:59.980 --> 30:01.930
tricia£¬sweetheart.

30:01.930 --> 30:05.060
tricia,darling,what's wrong?

30:08.210 --> 30:09.760
owen?

30:10.960 --> 30:12.840
you did it.

30:13.640 --> 30:14.680
tricia knows the truth.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.890
the game is over.

30:17.860 --> 30:19.730
you saved her from marrying hunter.

30:19.730 --> 30:23.090
isn't that-- isn't that what you wanted?

30:24.370 --> 30:25.510
owen?

30:25.510 --> 30:27.360
jim: maybe he crossed over.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.100
melinda: i don't think so.

30:28.100 --> 30:28.990
did everybody leave?

30:28.990 --> 30:32.320
oh,people cleared out of there like the place was on fire.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.940
trish and her mom are packing tonightto drive down to the city.

30:35.940 --> 30:38.180
maybe we can check in on them this weekend,go down.

30:38.180 --> 30:39.950
so,help me out here.

30:39.950 --> 30:42.890
are your ghosts all-knowing now?

30:42.890 --> 30:44.610
i mean,how did owen know the truth?

30:44.610 --> 30:46.860
well,hunter was at the lodge for a few days,you know,

30:46.860 --> 30:48.240
setting things up before the wedding.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.080
owen probably overheard something.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.320
and they're not "my ghosts.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.690
"sorry.

30:53.690 --> 30:56.550
did detective neely say what was going to happen to hunter

30:56.550 --> 30:59.370
or bob or whoever the heck he is?

30:59.370 --> 31:01.700
well,there's no law lying about your background.

31:01.700 --> 31:05.490
but finance is all about trust,so his career is over.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.820
marriage is about trust,too.

31:09.020 --> 31:11.490
all right,one more trip,we should be done.

31:11.490 --> 31:13.280
you want me to go with you?

31:13.280 --> 31:14.070
uh,no.

31:14.070 --> 31:18.860
um,why don't you stay here,you know,get everything done.

31:18.860 --> 31:22.820
and then that'll give us time to come home early,right?

31:24.210 --> 31:25.110
oh,right.

31:25.110 --> 31:25.850
yeah,ok.

31:25.850 --> 31:26.630
so i'll see you there.

31:26.630 --> 31:27.980
all right.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.380
owen?

31:40.480 --> 31:42.090
owen?

31:42.530 --> 31:44.490
where have you been?what's wrong?

31:44.490 --> 31:46.480
i tried to fix everything for her.

31:46.480 --> 31:47.320
and you did.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.660
she's safe now.

31:48.660 --> 31:50.000
hunter's gone.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.540
he's still at the lodge.

31:51.540 --> 31:53.030
he is?'cause--

31:53.030 --> 31:54.560
i mean,i'm sure he's gonna leave soon.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.040
there's no reason for him to stay there now.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.910
same goes for you.

31:58.910 --> 32:00.610
i think you're wrong.

32:00.980 --> 32:02.830
he's really mad.

32:02.830 --> 32:04.420
and he's acting weird.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.720
acting weird how?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.870
i don't want anyone else to get hurt.

32:10.540 --> 32:13.460
especially not you.

32:28.720 --> 32:32.190
Melinda calling

32:39.260 --> 32:40.080
you've reached jim.

32:40.080 --> 32:43.200
if this is an emergency,chances are,i'm already on my--

32:43.200 --> 32:44.820
forget it.

32:48.850 --> 32:49.530
detective neely.

32:49.530 --> 32:52.060
hey,detective neely,yeah,it's melinda.

32:52.060 --> 32:53.260
hey,melinda.what's up?

32:53.260 --> 32:55.020
um,listen,hunter is still at the lodge.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.290
and jim,he's up there...

32:57.290 --> 32:58.270
is everything ok?

32:58.270 --> 32:59.410
he's not answering his cell.

32:59.410 --> 33:00.530
i'm kind of freaking out.

33:00.530 --> 33:01.420
i can't really explain it.

33:01.420 --> 33:02.820
can you just meet me there?

33:02.820 --> 33:03.990
yeah,i'm on my way.

33:03.990 --> 33:05.230
thanks.

33:19.340 --> 33:20.550
hello?

33:23.790 --> 33:25.970
is somebody here?

33:28.930 --> 33:30.740
is somebody here?

33:40.420 --> 33:41.970
what are you doing?

33:41.970 --> 33:43.610
i'm waiting.

33:45.370 --> 33:47.190
well,she's not coming back.

33:47.890 --> 33:50.120
you know,let me ask you something,jim.

33:50.730 --> 33:55.650
you think that ghostwaited his whole life to be with someone like her?

33:55.650 --> 33:56.480
you need to leave.

33:56.480 --> 33:58.100
his whole life?

33:58.680 --> 34:00.710
that's right,i forgot,he's a ghost.

34:00.710 --> 34:02.380
his whole life.

34:02.380 --> 34:03.780
he's dead.

34:03.780 --> 34:04.670
look,come on.

34:04.670 --> 34:07.010
-listen to me--
-come to think of it...

34:07.980 --> 34:09.699
so am i.

34:10.739 --> 34:11.850
right.

34:11.850 --> 34:14.600
you know,i grew up by a lake just like this one,jim.

34:14.600 --> 34:19.909
when i was a kid,i used to sit on the beachand i had to watch the summer families just come and go.

34:19.909 --> 34:21.820
i remember i wanted to...

34:21.820 --> 34:24.070
go with 'em.

34:24.389 --> 34:26.560
i worked really hard in my life.

34:26.560 --> 34:28.469
but know what?

34:28.889 --> 34:31.580
it's never been enough.

34:31.580 --> 34:33.420
so i told a lie.

34:33.420 --> 34:35.120
just a small,little,itty-bitty one.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.790
just so i could open the door,you know?

34:36.790 --> 34:38.540
and it just got bigger and bigger.

34:38.540 --> 34:40.170
well,now's the time to shut it down.

34:40.170 --> 34:41.659
ok?

34:42.110 --> 34:43.429
give me the gun,hunter.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.940
what,this?

34:46.780 --> 34:49.780
dispatch 10 to 180,confirm your location,over.

34:49.780 --> 34:52.409
280 to dispatch,i'm off highway 5 near morton creek.intruder possible.

34:52.409 --> 34:54.210

34:55.310 --> 34:55.880
where's jim?

34:55.880 --> 34:57.780
he's still inside.stay here.

34:58.150 --> 35:00.020
hunter,you rebuilt your life from nothing.

35:00.020 --> 35:02.580
you've done that,you did it before.

35:02.580 --> 35:04.490
do it again.

35:04.490 --> 35:06.340
you know,you're right.

35:08.930 --> 35:10.530
nothing.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.990
'cause that's what i am.

35:16.890 --> 35:20.240
and that ghost is more real than you'll ever be.

35:47.810 --> 35:49.620
no!

35:50.800 --> 35:52.410
jim!

35:53.860 --> 35:55.280
jim,it's bobby.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.350
i tried to get here as fast as i could.

36:13.350 --> 36:15.210
don't be sorry.

36:15.210 --> 36:17.130
there's no pain.

36:17.130 --> 36:19.810
you don't have to be brave.

36:20.260 --> 36:21.840
i'm not,honey,i'm in shock.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.860
i don't feel any pain.

36:25.910 --> 36:27.190
oh,god!

36:27.190 --> 36:30.250

36:34.170 --> 36:35.620

36:37.380 --> 36:38.700
sorry about our date.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.520

36:40.520 --> 36:42.860
-rain check--
-yes,yes.

36:43.200 --> 36:44.940
we gotta go.

36:44.940 --> 36:46.910
i'll hold you to that.

36:49.120 --> 36:50.380
go.

37:12.100 --> 37:16.930
i didn't know what you wanted,so i got you hot chocolate,tea and coffee.

37:17.280 --> 37:18.580
you're sweet.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.370
hey,i'll put it down here.

37:20.370 --> 37:22.050
so any news?

37:23.020 --> 37:25.920
he was supposed to be out of surgery 40 minutes agoms.

37:26.800 --> 37:27.990
gordon?

37:27.990 --> 37:28.970
yes?

37:28.970 --> 37:32.130
jim's surgery was successful,and he's in stable condition.

37:32.130 --> 37:33.230
oh,thank god.

37:33.230 --> 37:36.070
if you like,i can walk you down to the recovery area.

37:36.070 --> 37:37.680
we'll wait here.

37:38.310 --> 37:40.880
the damage was much less than we first thought.

37:40.880 --> 37:44.170
the bullet went straight through his armand just barely grazed his ribs.

37:44.170 --> 37:45.560
so he's going to be ok?

37:45.560 --> 37:47.260
we'll be keeping an eye on him tonight.

37:47.260 --> 37:49.230
there's always the risk of infection,

37:49.230 --> 37:52.790
and especially with gunshot woundswe need to keep an eye out for embolisms.

37:52.790 --> 37:55.320
we'll have our best cardiologist watching him through the night.

37:55.320 --> 37:56.730
thank you.

37:56.730 --> 37:59.030
a nurse will call you in soon.

38:09.350 --> 38:11.480
how is he?

38:11.480 --> 38:13.500
he's resting.

38:14.350 --> 38:17.760
i feel horrible,for so many reasons.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.860
it's ok,it's not your fault.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.540
he'd be happy that you're here.

38:23.540 --> 38:25.360
thanks.

38:29.170 --> 38:31.110
owen's here too.

38:31.110 --> 38:32.670

38:32.670 --> 38:34.830

38:35.920 --> 38:38.120

38:39.500 --> 38:41.320

38:42.150 --> 38:46.540

38:46.900 --> 38:51.840

38:53.100 --> 38:55.590
i brought a stranger into our lives.

38:55.590 --> 38:57.540
how could i not see who he was?

38:57.540 --> 38:59.910

38:59.910 --> 39:01.620

39:10.920 --> 39:12.560

39:12.560 --> 39:13.920

39:13.920 --> 39:16.150
he wants you to look hard...

39:16.150 --> 39:18.660

39:27.880 --> 39:29.670

40:34.900 --> 40:37.250

40:37.980 --> 40:41.640

40:43.390 --> 40:45.910

41:25.360 --> 41:27.460

41:27.460 --> 41:29.780

41:30.510 --> 41:33.560

42:27.490 --> 42:29.710

42:29.710 --> 42:30.990
