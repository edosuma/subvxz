00:24.232 --> 00:28.486
A bit higher... Higher.
There, that's good, bro.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.654
[grunting]

00:29.738 --> 00:30.780
[Jonesy] We just need to be sure

00:30.864 --> 00:33.408
there's no structural damage
to any of these buildings.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.495
[grunting]

00:37.579 --> 00:41.082
Danny, make sure Apex and the others
understand they need to stay outside

00:41.166 --> 00:43.376
until we can be sure
the danger is really over.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.711
You got that, right?

00:44.794 --> 00:47.422
-We all have to stay outside.
-[grunting]

00:47.505 --> 00:50.800
Okay, but Mummo and I
are anxious to get back inside.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.386
Yeah. Anita's worried
about Mummo's kitchen.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.513
[grunting]

00:55.597 --> 00:58.308
She's saying the kitchen belongs
to both of you now.

00:58.391 --> 01:01.352
Oh. Gracias, Mummo.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.021
[grunting]

01:03.104 --> 01:06.733
Looks like you speak the same language
after all... Cooking!

-Thanks for the lift, bro.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.868
[grunting]

01:16.951 --> 01:19.621
So, what do you guys think caused it?

01:19.704 --> 01:22.624
[sighs]
It was either a natural disaster...

01:22.707 --> 01:24.959
Or a Botila-caused disaster.

01:26.085 --> 01:29.214
[Lukas] Jetpacks were dead, so they'll
have to charge while we're gone.

01:30.048 --> 01:31.591
[Jonesy] Panchi, mind coming along?

01:31.674 --> 01:34.427
We could use an extra set of eyes
while we survey the damage.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.721
-Sure, Jonesy!
-Guys, I've gotta--

01:36.805 --> 01:38.807
Danny, stay here
and set up the holoscreens.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.308
Wait! What about--

01:40.391 --> 01:43.311
Later, Danny!
I'll see you when I get back.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.779
Seriously? Guess my big news
will have to wait.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.739
[grunting]

01:59.160 --> 02:01.121
The damage is even worse over here.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.772
The ledge! It's starting to crack!

02:27.856 --> 02:31.860
Well, partner, looks like we're back
in the biz of rescuing endangered species.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.696
-Whoa!

-[Jonesy] Whoa! That was close!

02:42.912 --> 02:44.914
Steady now, Jonesy.

-[screeches]

03:03.099 --> 03:04.684
Wait, what's plan B?

Jonesy, find a way to distract mom.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.421
-And make it quick!
-You got it!

03:35.215 --> 03:36.799
Come and get me, mama! [laughs]

Okay, guys, I'm gonna need you
to restrain him while I free his leg.

Copy that.

You're on, Panchi.

I don't know if I can hang on much longer!

Just a bit further,

[Panchi] Lukas!

05:27.410 --> 05:28.494
Are you okay?

05:28.578 --> 05:32.498

Excuse me, why did you
just knock my head off?

Because I can, of course.

-Wait! Stop.
-Go long!

06:51.285 --> 06:55.665
-Isn't that where...
-The mouth of the volcano used to be.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.626
The only thing that can
melt rocks like that is a laser.

06:58.709 --> 07:03.005
And the only person
who would laser-shut a volcano is Botila.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.507
We're trapped down here.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.384
And without us to stop her,

07:06.467 --> 07:09.929
we can only imagine what terrible evil
she'll perpetrate next.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.722

[beeps]

07:25.570 --> 07:26.821

07:43.087 --> 07:45.214
Whoop-dee-doo for you.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.176
While this is amusing,

07:48.259 --> 07:53.181
it's time to put my remarkable power
to a more rewarding use.

07:53.264 --> 07:58.102
Now that I've entombed Kong and company
inside that volcano,

07:58.186 --> 08:01.314
there will be no one to stand in my way.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.443
Time to push my talent to the limits!

08:07.195 --> 08:11.032
And what better place to use
my ingenious skill than here,

08:11.115 --> 08:14.994
[scoffs] the International
Peacekeeping Project,

08:15.077 --> 08:19.040
a fully loaded weapons satellite,
orbiting in space,

08:19.123 --> 08:22.793
just waiting for my mind
to take control of it.

08:22.877 --> 08:26.839
I'm ready to wage all-out war on humanity.

Good work, Kong!

08:52.657 --> 08:54.492
Apex says that's the last one.

08:54.575 --> 08:56.994
And I just finished installing
the holoscreens.

08:58.454 --> 09:01.415
Let's take a load off
while we wait for the others to get back.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.417

09:05.795 --> 09:08.548
You must be so hungry
from all that hard work.

09:08.631 --> 09:12.009
Mummo and I made these treats for you.

09:35.449 --> 09:37.118
[Panchi] It was Botila for sure.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.870
That diabolical bot trapped us down here.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.124
Unless there's some other way
to get to the surface.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.835
-[grunts]
-[Danny] Do you know another way out?

09:45.918 --> 09:47.628
[grunting]

09:49.255 --> 09:51.007
Yes, there is another way!

09:51.090 --> 09:52.466
-Oh, yeah!
-[Panchi] Oh!

09:52.550 --> 09:54.719
[grunting]

09:54.802 --> 09:57.305
[sighs] Make that was.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.098
Humans started hunting apes,

09:59.181 --> 10:01.309
so they stopped going
to the surface at all

10:01.392 --> 10:02.768
and the exit was locked.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.980
[grunting]

10:07.773 --> 10:11.319
The key was hidden and now it's lost.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.987
Wait, he said "key!"

10:13.779 --> 10:16.073
Oh, that's what I've been
trying to tell you guys.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.159
While I was chasing Zippi
through those tunnels,

10:18.242 --> 10:20.620
I found this! A key!

10:20.703 --> 10:22.496
[grunting]

10:24.749 --> 10:25.791
I guess it's the key!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.960
[laughs] Great job, bro!

10:28.044 --> 10:29.462
[grunting]

10:29.545 --> 10:31.088
-[Jonesy] All right!
-[Lukas] Let's go.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.549
[Zippi whines]

10:33.633 --> 10:35.926
[chuckles] Lucky for us,
Zippi is such a royal pain

10:36.010 --> 10:38.137
or I'd never have found it. [chuckles]

10:38.220 --> 10:40.348
Kong, grab your jetpack!

10:40.431 --> 10:41.891
If there's really a way out,

10:41.974 --> 10:44.060
we want to be ready
to start hunting down Botila!

10:44.143 --> 10:45.519
[grunting]

10:51.692 --> 10:56.197
Are you certain we will not burn up
in this flying laboratory?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.366
You should know better than to doubt me.

10:59.617 --> 11:03.621
My internal thermostat calculates
the current temperature around our hull

11:03.704 --> 11:07.958
is 3,540.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.713
Make that .8!

11:15.216 --> 11:17.510
[Botila sighs] Chill out.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.929
-I know what I'm doing.
-[clones groaning]

11:21.847 --> 11:26.143
[clone] Except she forgot we'd lose
gravity once we left Earth's atmosphere.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.062
[clones groan]

11:28.145 --> 11:30.356
There you go. Gravity.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.192
Ah, yes, there it is.

11:33.275 --> 11:37.279
Enough missiles to take out
every major city on Earth.

11:37.363 --> 11:40.157
And they are all about to be mine!

11:45.955 --> 11:47.081
Speaking of mines...

11:47.164 --> 11:49.375
Those will surely blow us to smithereens.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.960
We can't get too close!

11:51.043 --> 11:52.211
[growls]

11:52.294 --> 11:54.380
You do see them, right?

11:54.463 --> 11:56.507
[Botila] Of course I see them.

11:56.590 --> 12:00.219
However, those AI sentries
will not see my mind

12:00.302 --> 12:03.139
when it leaps past them
faster than the speed of light,

12:03.222 --> 12:07.518
and I take control of the entire
missile launching system.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.688
Get ready to be shock and awed!

12:13.524 --> 12:14.358

12:20.114 --> 12:21.615
[sing-song] Hello!

12:21.699 --> 12:23.200
Forget the mines!

12:23.284 --> 12:25.953
-You've made all the missiles target us.
-[gasps]

12:26.036 --> 12:29.498
Quiet! I just need to concentrate

12:29.582 --> 12:33.419
and take over
the satellite's AI control system.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.381
-Before or after they incinerate us?
-[gasps]

12:40.009 --> 12:41.302

12:42.511 --> 12:43.637
[clones groan]

12:43.721 --> 12:46.390
[Botila] It's still a little too far.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.185
I just need to get a bit closer.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.312
[clone] Closer? Not closer!

12:52.021 --> 12:53.189
Oh, relax.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.275
I fortified the hull
with the last of the titanium,

12:56.358 --> 12:59.111
so that it won't matter when this happens.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.696
[clones scream]

13:02.072 --> 13:04.617
[man] You have entered
highly restricted air space.

Vacate the area immediately,
or your vessel will be destroyed.

13:08.579 --> 13:11.248
Good going, Empress Genius.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.834
They're going to blow us into space dust!

13:21.258 --> 13:24.470
[man] I repeat,
vacate this air space immediately.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.931
Or your vessel will be obliterated.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.558
Sir, she appears to be
coming up alongside.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.644
-Do we take evasive action?
-We should be cautious, sir.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.106
Hold fire until we find out more.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.776
We don't want to risk
an international incident.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.277
[officers murmuring]

13:40.903 --> 13:46.617
Identify yourselves and your mission
or we will open fire immediately.

13:51.789 --> 13:55.209
The second they hear the name "Botila,"
we're all toast.

13:55.292 --> 13:58.546
Oh, right, like I'm planning
to tell the truth.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.966
All this second-guessing me
is getting old.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.094
I thought I programmed them
better than this.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.345
[beeps]

14:12.101 --> 14:14.645
Please, we beg you, hold your fire!

14:14.728 --> 14:18.816
We're just a peaceful environmental
task-force sent here to do our job.

14:18.899 --> 14:22.570
We're risking our lives
to collect dangerous space junk,

14:22.653 --> 14:26.240
like abandoned satellites,
threatening to crash down on the Earth.

14:28.492 --> 14:31.328
Our tracking system
led us to your satellite.

14:31.412 --> 14:35.583
We had no way of knowing
it was some top-secret missile platform.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.418
-Sounds plausible.
-Could be truth.

14:37.501 --> 14:39.253
It sounds genuine to me.

14:39.336 --> 14:41.505
[Botila] Sadly for us,
your warning came too late

14:41.589 --> 14:44.633
and our ship sustained damage
when your mine hit it.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.052
We just need a little time
to do the repairs.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.971
I need absolute confirmation

14:49.054 --> 14:53.267
that there is no way anyone can penetrate
the on-board AI defense systems.

14:53.350 --> 14:57.229
Talk to me, people! You built it.
Do you stand by it or not?

14:57.313 --> 15:01.066
Absolutely. Our firewalls are
completely impenetrable.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.484
[officers agreeing]

15:04.570 --> 15:06.155
Okay, then.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.325
You have exactly 30 minutes
to make your repairs.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.492
Am I clear?

15:11.118 --> 15:12.202
Yes, sir!

15:12.286 --> 15:14.246
Thank you for sparing our lives.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.957
Ending transmission
so we can get right to work.

15:20.336 --> 15:24.715
[laughing] Humans are so gullible.

15:24.798 --> 15:27.718
Maybe, but their firewalls aren't.

15:27.801 --> 15:31.263
These mere mortals
haven't invented a firewall

15:31.347 --> 15:34.558
that my superior AI cannot break through!

15:34.642 --> 15:37.770
-[general] Beginning countdown.
-[timer beeping]

15:47.905 --> 15:49.114
[grunting]

15:50.616 --> 15:53.494
Sounds like whatever Apex
is looking for is close.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.004
Oh, no! Not those horrible
creepy vines again!

16:04.088 --> 16:07.132
-[squawks] We're doomed! We're doomed!
-[grunting]

16:07.216 --> 16:08.634
[roaring]

16:09.969 --> 16:11.595
[grunting]

16:15.307 --> 16:18.727
-I don't get it.
-Me neither. Where's the keyhole?

16:20.813 --> 16:23.315
[plays tune]

16:29.071 --> 16:30.406
[all gasp]

16:39.707 --> 16:41.917
-[Danny] Whoa!
-[Panchi] Whoa!

16:43.419 --> 16:44.586
[laughs] Awesome!

16:45.212 --> 16:47.297
[grunts excitedly]

16:47.381 --> 16:50.426
Hang on, bro!
Let the chopper go first.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.181
We don't know where we'll be popping up,
so let's hope we have a safe exit.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.438
[grunts]

17:02.521 --> 17:04.897
Aren't you coming with us, TÃ­a Anita?

17:04.982 --> 17:06.858
Uh... I better not.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.318
I have much too much work to do

17:08.402 --> 17:10.779
-exchanging recipes with Mummo.
-[grunting]

17:10.863 --> 17:12.448
Okay!

17:12.531 --> 17:15.534
[stammers] But you are coming back, right?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.785
That's the plan.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.203
[grunting]

17:20.164 --> 17:21.749
Thank you, Apex.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.751
[sighs] Let's do it.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.505
Okay, everybody, buckle up.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.300
There's no telling what kind of trouble
we might be flying into.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.019
[alarm blaring]

17:42.102 --> 17:46.231
You have violated our conditions.
Halt immediately or we will open fire.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.067
This is your final warning!

17:50.319 --> 17:53.614
[clone] What part of "being blown to bits"
does she not understand?

17:53.697 --> 17:55.574
None of this computes.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.160
She's finally lost it.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.109
[Botila] I've done it!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.694
I have all the power now!

18:35.989 --> 18:37.407
[officers clamoring]

18:37.491 --> 18:40.119
Someone give me an update now!

18:40.202 --> 18:41.745
-What's going on?
-This is not good.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.581
[clamoring continues]

18:46.458 --> 18:47.709
[all exclaiming]

18:49.711 --> 18:51.463
[general gasps] Botila...

18:51.547 --> 18:55.843
You will address me as Empress Botila.

18:55.926 --> 19:00.556
As you can see, I now have
complete control over all your missiles.

19:00.639 --> 19:04.768
Oh, and I've also tapped
into the major media satellites,

19:04.852 --> 19:08.188
so I am broadcasting this
to the entire world.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.816
Tell me we have some way to stop her.

19:11.692 --> 19:14.027
From now on, I am giving the orders.

19:14.111 --> 19:20.325
I am the one with my finger,
or should I say my mind, on the trigger.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.702
[laughing maniacally]

19:24.413 --> 19:26.039
[laughter continues]

19:26.874 --> 19:29.835
Where is Kong
when we desperately need him?

19:34.673 --> 19:36.175
[Jonesy] Confirm all clear.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.392
All right! C'mon up, Kong!

19:45.475 --> 19:47.269
[grunting]

19:48.437 --> 19:49.563
[plays tune]

19:52.357 --> 19:55.402
I've logged the exact coordinates
so we're all set to come and go.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.946
[Jonesy] Whoa.

20:00.490 --> 20:04.953
Being a fair-minded AI,
I am giving Earth 24 hours

20:05.037 --> 20:07.956
to shut down all defense systems
and surrender.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.333
[Danny groans]

20:10.250 --> 20:11.793
[roaring]

20:13.045 --> 20:18.050
If you do not comply in time
or if you attempt to stop me in any way,

20:18.133 --> 20:22.846
I will open fire on every major city
around the world!

20:22.930 --> 20:26.558
Gosh, this is what happens
when we take one day off?

20:26.642 --> 20:29.102
[groans] Let's get moving!

20:29.186 --> 20:32.898
Everyone's lives are at stake.
Make it count.

20:40.697 --> 20:42.366
