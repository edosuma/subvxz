00:06.420 --> 00:09.080
The Scale Festival starts tomorrow, huh?

00:09.080 --> 00:11.350
Everyone is really excited.

00:11.350 --> 00:14.660
It's our first festival in Akihabara, after all.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.610
Since the festival was approved,

00:17.610 --> 00:21.010
many guilds have been making 
special items for the event.

00:21.010 --> 00:22.160
So it seems.

00:22.180 --> 00:26.160
<b>Licensed by the Round Table 
Princess Figures (Wood Carved)</b>

00:22.180 --> 00:26.160
<b>Only 40 of Each Design! 
500 Gold</b>

00:22.870 --> 00:26.170
Just hearing there's a festival makes 
a lot of people want to do something.

00:27.850 --> 00:29.040
Decorations?

00:29.040 --> 00:31.090
You've got quite a lot there.

00:31.090 --> 00:33.840
They won't even fit in my magic bag.

00:34.150 --> 00:38.260
The Crescent Moon Alliance will 
be selling winter clothes?

00:38.510 --> 00:40.630
We're having a fashion show, as well.

00:41.540 --> 00:42.850
That sounds nice.

00:43.280 --> 00:46.940
It starts tomorrow, so we're 
doing the final touches today.

00:47.290 --> 00:49.140
Don't work too hard.

00:49.140 --> 00:51.690
I heard Crescent Moon Burgers 
will be making their return.

00:52.250 --> 00:53.620
That's right.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.470
So, what will you be doing during the festival?

00:56.470 --> 01:00.710
I'll be going around and 
enjoying all the different shops.

01:00.710 --> 01:01.700
I will eat...

01:01.700 --> 01:02.950
And eat some more!

01:03.320 --> 01:04.980
And Akatsuki and the others?

01:04.980 --> 01:07.870
Come to think of it, I didn't hear.

01:09.130 --> 01:11.270
What'll the girls be doing?

01:12.920 --> 01:15.300
Here, take one!

01:15.300 --> 01:17.720
Please come as a couple!

01:20.520 --> 01:23.270
I have to invite Shiroe!

01:23.270 --> 01:26.020
<b>All-You-Can-Eat Cake Buffet 
Come as a couple, and get in free!!</b>

03:02.720 --> 03:04.690
I've only made it this far because of you.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.400
It's true.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.460
<b>All-You-Can-Eat Cake Buffet 
Come as a couple, and get in free!!</b>

03:27.150 --> 03:29.390
I'm done with this!

03:29.930 --> 03:35.860
<b>Swallow and Young Starling</b>

03:31.820 --> 03:33.410
Swallow and Young Starling.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.610
Shiroe...

03:38.800 --> 03:40.850
Shutting yourself up in here again?

03:42.440 --> 03:45.950
Handling the Round Table's paperwork, 
investigating this world...

03:46.420 --> 03:49.270
I have a ton of work to do.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.400
Are you eating enough?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.390
Sleeping enough?

03:53.390 --> 03:55.210
Yes and yes.

03:55.790 --> 03:59.350
I ate two hours ago, and I 
took a fifteen-minute nap.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.760
That's fine, then!

04:02.520 --> 04:04.450
Here is what you requested.

04:04.450 --> 04:05.580
Oh, thanks...

04:05.580 --> 04:07.490
You didn't need to bring it.

04:07.490 --> 04:09.720
If you had just sent a message, 
I would've come to get it.

04:10.290 --> 04:13.610
So you say, but would you really have come?

04:13.610 --> 04:17.250
I've heard you've been locked in here for ages,

04:17.250 --> 04:19.410
so I wanted to check on you, too.

04:19.410 --> 04:20.490
Thanks.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.790
How's the Scale Festival looking?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.350
Karashin's going all-out.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.740
He's really taken charge of the event.

04:27.740 --> 04:29.240
He does good work.

04:29.580 --> 04:33.500
You should take a break 
for these next three days.

04:34.510 --> 04:35.660
Yeah...

04:36.050 --> 04:38.650
During the festival, it'll be pretty noisy,

04:38.650 --> 04:40.630
so I probably won't be able to concentrate...

04:40.810 --> 04:42.450
That isn't why!

04:43.030 --> 04:47.510
This is a good chance for you to 
become closer to your guildmates.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.010
And...

04:49.010 --> 04:53.030
Log Horizon is one of the Round Table guilds.

04:53.030 --> 04:56.180
You'll be out there, making the event fun, right?

04:56.990 --> 04:58.330
I'll try.

04:58.330 --> 04:59.800
You'd better!

05:00.130 --> 05:00.900
Right!

05:02.650 --> 05:05.280
Akatsuki and Minori are so cute, too.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.330
I'm so excited already!

05:08.330 --> 05:09.080
What's that?

05:09.080 --> 05:12.450
An Akatsuki doll that Akatsuki gave me!

05:13.340 --> 05:14.710
A voodoo doll?

05:14.710 --> 05:18.790
Truly, as long as I have my fantasies, 
I barely even need to eat!

05:19.050 --> 05:22.860
They say that man does not live by bread alone.

05:22.860 --> 05:27.450
But with bread and fantasies, 
you can get over almost anything!

05:27.450 --> 05:29.150
God almighty!

05:30.810 --> 05:35.310
<b>You're just playing around, 
aren't you?</b>

05:31.580 --> 05:35.310
<i>She's right... During the festival, 
it'll be hard to do much.</i>

05:35.940 --> 05:38.760
<i>When reports come in, 
I'll have to do some fancy footwork,</i>

05:38.760 --> 05:40.320
<i>so I'll end up waiting, anyway.</i>

05:41.280 --> 05:43.930
<i>Since then, nothing has happened in Minami...</i>

05:43.930 --> 05:45.930
M-My lord...

05:48.580 --> 05:49.930
Welcome back...

05:50.240 --> 05:51.370
Has something happened?

05:52.330 --> 05:54.380
No... Well...

05:54.730 --> 05:57.200
You want a red bean bun?

05:55.740 --> 05:59.620
<b>Red Bean Buns</b>

05:58.320 --> 05:59.240
Eh?

06:03.210 --> 06:05.010
Great weather today!

06:05.010 --> 06:07.230
It feels like forever since I was outside.

06:07.230 --> 06:08.140
This is for you.

06:08.140 --> 06:09.510
You're sure?

06:10.030 --> 06:12.300
In this world, red bean buns are expensive.

06:13.860 --> 06:15.270
I want you to eat them.

06:15.790 --> 06:16.770
Thank you.

06:24.040 --> 06:25.340
Delicious...

06:25.340 --> 06:27.010
It's been a long time since I've had one.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.820
Wh-What?

06:32.390 --> 06:34.250
There's bean paste on your mouth.

06:34.930 --> 06:36.020
Oh, thanks.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.510
Lately, you've looked pale.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.590
That isn't true.

06:41.210 --> 06:42.040
Really?

06:46.060 --> 06:47.760
M-My lord...

06:48.240 --> 06:50.140
What's gotten into you?

06:50.140 --> 06:53.260
What are you going to do during the festival?

06:53.260 --> 06:54.140
The festival?

06:54.500 --> 06:57.770
Oh, I'll probably have to help with things.

06:57.770 --> 06:59.810
Henrietta asked me to.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.360
I see...

07:04.630 --> 07:06.350
No, I mean...

07:07.680 --> 07:10.130
My lord, do you like c-c-ca...

07:10.820 --> 07:12.320
<b>All-You-Can-Eat Cake Buffet 
Come as a couple, and get in free!!</b>

07:11.340 --> 07:12.320
VoilÃ !

07:13.020 --> 07:13.990
What is that?

07:13.990 --> 07:17.010
So, about the Scale Festival tomorrow...

07:17.010 --> 07:18.990
Would you go to this with me?

07:19.320 --> 07:20.670
A cake buffet?

07:21.400 --> 07:24.650
You enjoy sweets, don't you?

07:25.040 --> 07:28.130
From the way he eats his red bean buns, 
that would seem to be true.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.250
I certainly don't dislike them...

07:30.760 --> 07:32.060
Let us go, my lord.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.940
If we go as a couple, it's free!

07:34.940 --> 07:36.400
It's free! Totally free!

07:36.400 --> 07:37.310
Let's go!

07:40.850 --> 07:42.300
Um...

07:42.300 --> 07:43.560
Shiroe!

07:42.300 --> 07:43.560
My lord!

07:51.070 --> 07:52.160
<i>This is a problem.</i>

07:52.490 --> 07:53.410
<i>What should I do?</i>

07:54.960 --> 07:55.940
I know.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.080
Maybe not this...

08:00.080 --> 08:01.330
Minori!

08:01.650 --> 08:04.030
There's a pre-festival dance tonight.

08:04.030 --> 08:05.080
Wanna come with...

08:05.080 --> 08:06.700
Uh, what are you doing?

08:07.790 --> 08:10.390
I'll be going out with Shiroe tomorrow,

08:10.390 --> 08:12.230
but I'm not sure what to wear.

08:12.230 --> 08:13.430
Going out?

08:13.840 --> 08:16.570
With Shiroe, the shut-in?!

08:19.480 --> 08:24.960
I don't think I've seen him outside for a week.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.460
So, where are you going?

08:26.460 --> 08:27.850
A cake buffet.

08:27.850 --> 08:29.400
Shiroe, eating cake?

08:29.860 --> 08:31.240
Why?

08:31.240 --> 08:33.760
Well, if you win this contest,

08:33.760 --> 08:38.680
you get two tickets to the Twilight Banquet 
with Princess Lenessia on the second day.

08:34.820 --> 08:40.330
<b>Participants compete to see who can eat the most slices! 
The top two teams advance to the final battle!</b>

08:40.670 --> 08:46.040
No one trusts Shiroe. They say they 
don't know what he's thinking...

08:46.740 --> 08:49.090
But he's actually really nice.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.220
I'm sad that they don't understand him.

08:52.660 --> 08:56.370
I want them all to know more about him.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.600
I understand!

08:59.750 --> 09:01.000
Okay! Got it!

09:01.350 --> 09:02.730
I'll help you!

09:02.730 --> 09:04.060
I'll coordinate your outfit!

09:04.620 --> 09:06.840
Really? Thanks!

09:10.740 --> 09:14.280
<i>Why does Minori have to put pressure on me?</i>

09:14.710 --> 09:17.170
<i>My rival is a middle-schooler?</i>

09:17.890 --> 09:22.440
<i>Even if he does normally treat me 
like a kid, this doesn't seem fair...</i>

09:23.400 --> 09:25.970
<i>Is it my lord's fault for treating me as a kid?</i>

09:25.970 --> 09:27.160
<i>Is it?</i>

09:28.310 --> 09:29.000
<i>But...</i>

09:29.840 --> 09:31.110
...because of you.

09:32.210 --> 09:37.260
<i>My lord didn't judge me based 
on my appearance or level.</i>

09:38.270 --> 09:42.510
<i>He accepted me for who I am...</i>

09:45.330 --> 09:49.240
<i>My lord said he'd attend the buffet 
with both Minori and me.</i>

09:49.890 --> 09:53.150
<i>But it's supposed to be a couple, 
so we'll probably be alone...</i>

09:55.740 --> 09:57.470
<i>Is this situation...</i>

09:58.730 --> 10:00.120
<i>...a date?!</i>

10:00.350 --> 10:01.360
<i>Impossible...</i>

10:01.360 --> 10:02.120
<i>Impossible!</i>

10:02.410 --> 10:03.750
<i>And what will I wear?!</i>

10:05.470 --> 10:07.360
What do you suppose is going on?

10:07.360 --> 10:09.630
It's getting lively around here.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.800
<i>I have no cute clothes.</i>

10:12.800 --> 10:14.630
<i>What am I going to wear?</i>

10:14.630 --> 10:16.590
<i>Oh, I'll ask someone to help me.</i>

10:17.860 --> 10:19.020
What's happened?

10:19.020 --> 10:20.230
I felt it...

10:20.230 --> 10:23.060
Akatsuki needs my help!

10:25.220 --> 10:26.340
Akatsuki!

10:26.340 --> 10:28.060
<i>I'll pick something myself...</i>

10:28.060 --> 10:30.060
<b>Crafting Guild 
Council Office 

Knock First!!</b>

10:28.700 --> 10:30.060
No, no...

10:30.400 --> 10:32.610
That's going to be expensive.

10:32.610 --> 10:34.770
No, I'm afraid not.

10:34.770 --> 10:36.820
The Council doesn't play favorites.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.180
Your location is determined by lottery.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.820
We must adhere to that.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.990
Hey, you're doing all that yourself?

10:44.360 --> 10:45.990
I don't have a choice.

10:45.990 --> 10:48.600
This place is like a business congress.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.420
Then, are these all...

10:50.420 --> 10:52.200
I asked everyone to submit them

10:52.200 --> 10:56.010
so I could check for any dangerous items.

10:56.470 --> 10:58.150
It's a terrifying amount.

10:58.150 --> 10:59.510
Isn't it?

11:00.060 --> 11:03.390
The People of the Land's 
merchants are also coming.

11:03.650 --> 11:08.630
I'm getting the sense that the festival 
is a lot bigger than it should be.

11:08.630 --> 11:10.560
The next few days are gonna be hell...

11:10.560 --> 11:11.470
Huh?

11:14.160 --> 11:15.200
When did you get here?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.230
Please help.

11:16.470 --> 11:17.520
This is rare.

11:17.520 --> 11:18.490
Are you alone?

11:18.490 --> 11:19.990
What's wrong?

11:20.570 --> 11:21.760
I...

11:23.410 --> 11:25.490
...require fashion!

11:26.990 --> 11:27.730
Huh?

11:40.500 --> 11:42.810
Shiroe, of Log Horizon...

11:43.300 --> 11:45.640
And two others?

11:45.640 --> 11:46.570
Yes.

11:47.570 --> 11:49.610
Sorry to ask this of you...

11:49.610 --> 11:51.440
Oh, if that's the case, I understand.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.310
I'm sure this will be difficult for you...

11:54.720 --> 11:56.400
But good luck!

11:59.060 --> 12:00.460
<i>What did she mean?</i>

12:02.830 --> 12:05.080
<i>It really is all couples...</i>

12:06.750 --> 12:08.580
Let's eat!

12:09.120 --> 12:12.260
<i>I'm glad all three of us could get in together.</i>

12:13.610 --> 12:15.730
What? All three of us?

12:15.730 --> 12:16.590
Yes.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.120
I just got permission from 
Kanako, the organizer.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.870
We'll have to eat twelve to enter 
as a trio, but I think we can do it.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.500
Okay.

12:26.500 --> 12:28.880
Let's win, and go to the finals!

12:28.880 --> 12:30.350
Right, Akatsuki?

12:31.420 --> 12:32.340
Yes.

12:34.230 --> 12:37.830
<i>To be honest, I don't think 
I could've eaten here twice.</i>

12:39.130 --> 12:40.610
<i>But...</i>

12:41.340 --> 12:44.110
<i>What is this feeling? Pressure?</i>

12:44.380 --> 12:47.570
That's a wonderful kimono, Akatsuki.

12:48.610 --> 12:50.380
It's rare to see you in a kimono.

12:50.380 --> 12:51.260
What's up?

12:51.260 --> 12:52.870
Th-This is...

12:53.380 --> 12:56.910
A guild called Kimono Komachi made it for me...

12:58.070 --> 12:59.880
Does it look okay?

13:00.210 --> 13:00.710
It's a grâ

13:00.710 --> 13:02.120
It is not for graduation.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.040
It is for fashion.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.380
Grâ

13:04.730 --> 13:07.090
It's graceful, and really nice. Yeah.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.690
R-Really?

13:08.690 --> 13:10.860
Yes, it's very cute.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.350
You look good, too, Minori.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.110
Thank you.

13:16.390 --> 13:18.860
Isuzu chose this for me.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.180
Really?

13:20.180 --> 13:23.710
Yes, she took me to a bunch of stores.

13:23.710 --> 13:26.280
Why don't you come with us sometime?

13:27.190 --> 13:28.010
Okay.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.690
Isuzu knows a lot about clothes.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.750
I was surprised.

13:35.570 --> 13:37.110
That looks so good!

13:37.110 --> 13:38.180
My lord! My lord!

13:38.180 --> 13:39.500
I have high hopes for this!

13:39.760 --> 13:41.090
Aren't they pretty?

13:41.090 --> 13:42.700
Isn't this exciting?

13:42.700 --> 13:46.010
Yeah, I think I could eat four of those.

13:46.010 --> 13:48.260
Here you go!

13:50.350 --> 13:51.800
Eh? Huh?

13:51.800 --> 13:54.220
Here, enjoy!

13:54.220 --> 13:57.520
"Enjoy"? But those are whole cakes!

13:57.520 --> 14:00.470
It's a little present from my guild!

14:01.500 --> 14:02.960
<i>Present?</i>

14:06.300 --> 14:07.540
Um...

14:08.620 --> 14:11.110
Let's start with one.

14:11.110 --> 14:12.130
Yeah.

14:12.130 --> 14:13.160
Let's eat.

14:19.180 --> 14:20.290
It's great...

14:20.590 --> 14:22.430
Really, my lord? You like it?

14:22.430 --> 14:23.380
What are you doing?

14:23.380 --> 14:25.420
Serving my lord.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.800
Serving me? That's a whole cake!

14:28.380 --> 14:30.060
I'll cut it up.

14:30.060 --> 14:32.060
That isn't the issue.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.610
It's not fair that you got to bring two!

14:35.430 --> 14:37.310
Unbelievable.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.970
<i>Crap... Is that how this looks?</i>

14:38.530 --> 14:39.830
Is he trying to show off?

14:40.370 --> 14:41.500
Die.

14:40.970 --> 14:43.570
<i>This isn't good... I'll get them both involved.</i>

14:42.410 --> 14:43.570
I hope his glasses break.

14:44.320 --> 14:46.670
<i>I need to avoid making a fuss.</i>

14:46.670 --> 14:49.190
<i>Minimize damage and retreat.</i>

14:49.190 --> 14:49.860
My lord.

14:51.060 --> 14:51.850
Here.

14:53.050 --> 14:55.110
Am I supposed to eat that?

14:55.110 --> 14:56.330
Of course, my lord.

14:56.800 --> 14:57.860
Say, "ah."

15:00.600 --> 15:02.430
Come on, it'll fall off.

15:04.460 --> 15:05.950
Is it good, my lord?

15:05.950 --> 15:06.850
Mhm.

15:07.230 --> 15:08.250
Shiroe!

15:09.340 --> 15:11.180
Say, "ah"!

15:12.840 --> 15:14.530
Try this, too.

15:16.420 --> 15:17.690
Is it good?

15:17.690 --> 15:20.450
Well, yeah, it's good, but...

15:21.140 --> 15:26.000
<i>I'd rather fight a dozen raid bosses at once!</i>

15:26.000 --> 15:26.870
My lord.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.080
There's still more.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.200
"Ah"...

15:30.200 --> 15:31.510
Me, too!

15:31.510 --> 15:32.700
"Ah"!

15:34.910 --> 15:35.860
"Ah"!

15:36.310 --> 15:37.700
"Ah"!

15:38.600 --> 15:40.710
<i>Someone help me!</i>

15:44.340 --> 15:53.580
<b>CafÃ© Kanako</b>

15:44.590 --> 15:46.880
Thank you!

15:46.880 --> 15:50.120
Sorry you had to pay.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.760
We couldn't eat them all.

15:51.760 --> 15:53.070
I had no choice.

15:53.930 --> 15:55.960
Will you go home and rest, my lord?

15:55.960 --> 15:59.190
I was going to see the rest of the 
festival, but I think I will...

16:01.850 --> 16:05.270
Um... You two go on without me.

16:05.270 --> 16:07.860
I need to make a stop before going back.

16:09.150 --> 16:10.910
Thank you!

16:14.050 --> 16:16.870
<i>Dandelion barley tea is good for digestion, right?</i>

16:17.440 --> 16:20.980
<i>I'm sad I couldn't attend 
the Twilight Banquet,</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:23.210
<i>but Shiroe worked hard for me.</i>

16:23.720 --> 16:25.230
<i>I'll have to thank him.</i>

16:35.810 --> 16:37.140
<i>It hurts...</i>

16:37.580 --> 16:40.640
<i>Three people eating twelve whole cakes?</i>

16:40.640 --> 16:42.440
<i>How did she figure that?</i>

16:42.870 --> 16:44.560
Oh, right.

16:45.370 --> 16:47.820
A cake buffet?

16:48.130 --> 16:50.290
It'll probably be there tomorrow. 
Why not go?

16:50.290 --> 16:51.320
It'll be free.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.020
That sounds great!

16:53.020 --> 16:54.740
I'll definitely go.

16:54.960 --> 16:58.320
Thanks for the information, Shiro!

16:58.740 --> 16:59.370
Sure.

17:00.150 --> 17:03.310
<i>I wonder how many whole 
cakes he'll end up eating...</i>

17:06.570 --> 17:09.600
<i>But all the girls love Soujirou,</i>

17:09.940 --> 17:12.370
<i>yet he still does well running his guild.</i>

17:13.610 --> 17:18.120
<i>Naotsugu or Chief Nyanta seem more 
like guild masters than I do.</i>

17:18.810 --> 17:20.970
<i>I don't really have the presence.</i>

17:21.940 --> 17:26.190
<i>Maybe Henrietta's right, and this 
would be a good chance.</i>

17:26.920 --> 17:29.510
<i>I should make time to spend with everyone.</i>

17:29.900 --> 17:30.810
My lord.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.390
When did you get there?!

17:33.390 --> 17:34.220
Just now.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.510
Is something wrong?

17:37.920 --> 17:41.250
No, nothing...

17:45.020 --> 17:47.140
The town is even more lively than usual.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.000
It is a festival, after all.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.490
When we first arrived in this world, 
I never would've imagined it.

17:54.140 --> 17:55.070
Yeah.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.980
You're quiet.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.640
I'm always quiet.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.520
Yeah, but...

18:04.950 --> 18:06.140
My lord...

18:07.530 --> 18:09.520
Do you, well...

18:10.020 --> 18:11.680
Dislike cake?

18:13.270 --> 18:16.780
Or did you not have fun?

18:17.520 --> 18:19.270
That's not true...

18:19.270 --> 18:21.760
Anyway, I'm sorry we didn't get to the finals.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.040
That doesn't matter to me.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.040
It was Minori who wanted to go.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.560
I see...

18:29.600 --> 18:32.860
But was that cake okay with you?

18:33.740 --> 18:37.910
It felt like I was doing all the eating. 
Did you have any?

18:38.290 --> 18:39.550
I...

18:40.460 --> 18:43.180
I wasn't there for the cake.

18:43.530 --> 18:45.110
Oh...

18:45.110 --> 18:48.000
It's hard to hold a conversation 
with you, my lord!

18:48.000 --> 18:50.310
I don't know what to say.

18:50.310 --> 18:53.300
You just don't talk much.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.100
That isn't true...

18:55.100 --> 18:57.100
I have all sorts of things to discuss.

18:57.100 --> 19:00.020
Then give us something to talk about.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.370
<i>Was that a little harsh?</i>

19:05.970 --> 19:09.490
Um, I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

19:10.130 --> 19:10.710
Er...

19:10.930 --> 19:11.780
Wait...

19:17.820 --> 19:20.380
It's fun to do this.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.770
Is that really fun?

19:26.720 --> 19:28.060
It is.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.730
Oh...

19:30.760 --> 19:33.780
<i>Is this part of her lord-and-servant role playing?</i>

19:37.860 --> 19:39.060
This is enough?

19:39.690 --> 19:40.780
Yes...

19:42.140 --> 19:43.080
I see.

19:55.990 --> 19:57.860
<i>What is this?</i>

19:59.590 --> 20:00.530
<i>Why?</i>

20:03.960 --> 20:05.410
<i>Akatsuki...</i>

20:07.710 --> 20:09.340
<i>likes...</i>

20:12.750 --> 20:14.160
<i>Shiroe!</i>

20:17.290 --> 20:18.610
<i>I...</i>

20:19.840 --> 20:21.610
<i>I also...</i>

20:28.600 --> 20:29.810
<i>like him.</i>

20:33.450 --> 20:34.580
It isn't fair!

20:34.580 --> 20:36.000
Shiroe is mine!

20:40.610 --> 20:41.920
Not fair?

20:42.900 --> 20:45.240
How could I have said that?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.290
<i>It hurts...</i>

20:50.660 --> 20:51.860
<i>This isn't...</i>

20:53.330 --> 20:54.190
Minori?

20:55.560 --> 20:57.500
What are you doing here?

20:58.070 --> 20:58.900
Whoa...

20:58.900 --> 21:00.470
Look at your face...

21:01.310 --> 21:02.350
Tohya!

21:06.010 --> 21:08.350
Well? What happened?

21:09.270 --> 21:11.290
Listen, Tohya.

21:12.110 --> 21:13.440
I...

21:13.910 --> 21:18.530
think I like Shiroe...

21:18.530 --> 21:19.670
What?

21:20.090 --> 21:21.820
You're just now figuring it out?

21:22.640 --> 21:24.580
It was obvious to the rest of us.

21:24.580 --> 21:25.680
No way...

21:26.240 --> 21:29.390
He's nice, and he's caring.

21:29.390 --> 21:31.410
He's like a teacher.

21:31.410 --> 21:33.440
I can see why you'd admire him.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.420
How could you tell?

21:35.420 --> 21:37.710
Of course I can tell! We're twins!

21:38.040 --> 21:40.640
I admire him, too!

21:41.320 --> 21:43.450
You like him, too?!

21:43.450 --> 21:44.820
Not like that!

21:48.070 --> 21:50.110
This is a problem...

21:50.110 --> 21:51.030
Why?

21:51.780 --> 21:52.820
"Why"?

21:53.290 --> 21:55.040
I don't think it's a problem.

21:56.540 --> 22:01.340
It's not a problem... 
You're just hurt, Minori.

22:07.350 --> 22:08.460
Is it okay?

22:08.860 --> 22:10.400
You can't help it, right?

22:14.730 --> 22:15.820
You're right...

22:16.850 --> 22:19.200
It isn't a problem...

22:19.200 --> 22:20.340
It just hurts.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.560
I haven't lost anything, 
and I haven't done anything.

22:26.130 --> 22:29.990
I haven't done anything yet, have I?

22:30.670 --> 22:31.830
That's true.

22:32.790 --> 22:33.780
Yeah.

24:05.780 --> 24:08.370
The girl simply admired him.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.520
She wanted to be like him...

24:10.520 --> 24:11.930
To follow him.

24:11.930 --> 24:14.010
To stand behind him. That was all.

24:14.370 --> 24:18.640
But it didn't take long for those 
feelings to turn to love.

24:19.280 --> 24:21.340
Minori is in love with Shiroe.

24:21.850 --> 24:29.990
<b>Student of the Mage</b>

24:22.040 --> 24:24.220
Next time: Student of the Mage.

24:24.630 --> 24:26.620
We will change the world.
